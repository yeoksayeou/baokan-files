At the National Women's Congress, the Deceptive Mask of this Rightist Element was Stripped Away
Liu Wang Liming is a Running Dog Raised by American Dollars
Until 1951, she was still receiving a monthly subsidy of 300 US dollars. Since liberation, she has been propagating the "policy of strength" of American imperialism and actively participating in the conspiracy activities of the Zhang-Luo Alliance.

Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: The representatives attending the Third National Women's Congress of China tracked down and pursued the rightist element Liu Wang Liming. According to the revealed materials, this seemingly confusing and difficult to understand Liu Wang Liming turned out to be a loyal running dog raised by American imperialism, bowing down to money, and an old-brand rightist who was in cahoots with Luo Longji.

At yesterday's and today's congresses and in the Zhejiang provincial group meetings, the representatives fully exposed and criticized Liu Wang Liming.

Shen Ziji, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation, revealed at today's congress that Liu Wang Liming was an old rightist far back in the stage of China's New Democratic Revolution. She was long supported by American imperialism. From before liberation to the present, she used the legal organizations of the Chinese Women's Temperance Union and the China Democratic League to act as the backbone of the Zhang-Luo Alliance's anti-communist and anti-people activities, carrying out a series of political conspiracies.

Shen Ziji said that before liberation, Liu Wang Liming firmly advocated taking the "middle road," attempting to maintain the rule of American imperialism in China. In 1947, when the revolutionary war was winning victories one after another, Liu Wang Liming openly advocated in Shanghai: "The CCP should not cross the river. Jiangbei belongs to the CCP, Jiangnan belongs to the Kuomintang, and a neutral zone should be划 out in the middle and managed by the United Nations." She also said: "Today we want peace, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should demarcate a neutral zone and ask the British and Americans to station troops." Shen Ziji believed that Liu Wang Liming's shameless behavior was "no different from the traitors in Chinese history."

After liberation, Liu Wang Liming openly promoted American imperialism. In 1952, she even took advantage of the opportunity to visit and慰问 North Korea to promote the so-called "democracy" of American imperialism in front of the Chinese People's Volunteers. She also煽动 stirred up emotions with ulterior motives in front of the wounded volunteer soldiers, saying: "It's pitiful! Why war!" Shen Ziji said that the purpose of Liu Wang Liming's vicious words was to undermine the just war of resisting America and aiding Korea and defending the country.

Shen Ziji said that Liu Wang Liming had also personally promoted the "policy of strength" of American imperialism to her, shamelessly boasting about how powerful the American missiles were.

Shen Ziji revealed that Liu Wang Liming had been closely colluding with Luo Longji from the day she joined the League. They advocated the "middle road," opposed the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session of the China Democratic League, opposed the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the China Democratic League, and all their activities were in the same breath. When Luo Longji and Zhang Dongsun organized an anti-communist group in 1950 to carry out conspiracies, Liu Wang Liming cooperated with their activities to openly slander the Soviet Union viciously, and turned her home into a "机关 office" for the anti-communist group's conspiracy activities. Subsequently, she also sent her son Liu Guanghua to act as Luo Longji's minion.

Zhang Manjun, the wife of martyr Li Gongpu, revealed about Liu Wang Liming at today's congress that Liu Wang Liming is a sanctimonious Christian who shouts "save people and save oneself," but in reality, she is harming people and harming herself. The "savior" she worships is money, and the "heaven" she yearns for is the money empire. She had been投靠 relying on American imperialism since she was nineteen years old. Later, she served in the Far East Women's Temperance Union, which was used by American imperialism, receiving a high salary of one hundred US dollars per month and one hundred and twenty US dollars for office expenses. She also inherited an estate of about ten thousand US dollars from her American "godmother." Until 1951, Liu Wang Liming continued to receive a monthly subsidy of three hundred US dollars from American imperialism. Zhang Manjun said that American imperialism's money is not spent for nothing. Every US dollar spent through Liu Wang Liming's hands contains political conspiracies and political purposes. Liu Wang Liming indeed made money fully发挥发挥 play its role in cultural aggression.

Zhang Manjun also said that the ugly nature of the bourgeoisie, who only seek profit, is also concentrated in Liu Wang Liming. Liu Wang Liming has always used the excuse of running children's welfare undertakings to gather money and fill her own pockets. Even after liberation, she continued to套购 purchase foreign exchange at fixed prices, engaged in black market transactions of US dollars, used public funds from the China Democratic League headquarters to engage in speculative business for奸商 unscrupulous merchants, and defrauded donations for children's playgrounds.

Zhang Manjun finally said that she was very excited to see many martyrs' wives and mothers of martyrs in the venue. She said that her husband was killed by Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries with American silent pistols, and Liu Wang Liming's husband was assassinated by Japanese imperialism. The Communist Party has now avenged these murders. She questioned Liu Wang Liming: Today you are attacking the Communist Party, where is your conscience?

Tao Shufan, the principal of the Second Affiliated Primary School of Beijing Normal University and a model teacher, refuted Liu Wang Liming's absurd remarks on the issues of admission to higher education for senior primary school graduates and the future of young people at the congress speech yesterday afternoon. Liu Wang Liming attacked the Communist Party at the National Political Consultative Conference in March this year by using the issue that not all secondary school graduates could enter higher education. She said that if the problem of admission to higher education for primary and secondary school graduates is not resolved, it will cause serious consequences. These serious consequences are: children and young people are passive, depressed and dissatisfied, parents feel disappointed and increase their burdens, the work efficiency of parents will be reduced, and the number of idlers in society will increase, and so on. She also said that there are only two ways out for senior primary school graduates and high school graduates: to become teachers or students.

Tao Shufan refuted Liu Wang Liming's absurd remarks, saying that not going to higher education and dropping out of school are fundamentally two different things. In our socialist country, the educational policy is to cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness, culture, and good health. It is completely normal for young people to study in school for a period of time and then participate in socialist physical or mental labor. Judging from the development of education in the past few years, the speed of development of primary and secondary schools is not only unprecedented in Chinese history, but also rare in the history of world education.

In Liu Wang Liming's view, not going to higher education and becoming a teacher is the only way out, and participating in physical labor is regarded as having no way out. Tao Shufan said that the fact is not like this at all. In our socialist country, participating in physical labor is also a glorious way out. Liu Wang Liming said that if the problem of admission to higher education for primary and secondary school students is not solved, there will be serious consequences. Tao Shufan said that judging from the facts of more than half a year, Liu Wang Liming estimated incorrectly. This year's primary and secondary school graduates who did not enter higher education did not make trouble. Taking Liaoning Province as an example, by mid-August, more than 135,000 primary and secondary school graduates of this year happily participated in agricultural production.

During the group meetings held in Zhejiang yesterday and today, many people who were familiar with Liu Wang Liming's details launched a tit-for-tat struggle with her.

In her account at the two-day group meeting, Liu Wang Liming lied and deceived people, avoided the important and dwelt on the trivial, and tried her best to avoid her relationship with the Zhang-Luo Alliance. But she also said, "The establishment of the Chengdu branch of the Women's Temperance Union was to expand the influence of Zhang and Luo. If this branch responds to Zhang and Luo's conspiracy, my crime will be even greater."

Liu Wang Liming also狡赖 quibbled that she handed over the Women's Temperance Union branch to be established in Chengdu to Pan Dakui to lead because "the Chengdu Women's Federation did not lead," and quibbled that she recruited people with political problems as members because she "didn't know in advance." Wang Ze, director of the Chengdu Women's Federation, exposed these sophistry one by one on the spot. Wang Ze said that the Chengdu Women's Federation had never said that it would not lead the Temperance Union, but because the establishment of the Chengdu branch was illegal. Liu Wang Liming couldn't wait to find Pan Dakui to lead, indicating that she did not want the Women's Federation to lead at all. Wang Ze also said: Liu Wang Liming's claim that she did not know the political background of these people in the branch is an even more shameless lie. After the establishment of the Chengdu branch, even the people in their branch mocked themselves and said: "It's simply a labor reform brigade." But Liu Wang Liming repeatedly said "it doesn't matter."

Liao Jingwen also revealed the fact that Liu Wang Liming sent a person named Li Qianyun to her home to start rumors at the beginning of the rectification movement. Li Qianyun said that Liu Wang Liming once said, "Now people's lives are very hard, eating糠 bran and vegetables." She also said: "There is a girl in Renmin University who is very talented and can write tens of thousands of words. She grew up in the revolutionary army. Can it be said that she was incited by others to have anti-party emotions?" Li Qianyun also said: "The Communist Party's rectification is used to rectify others." Before leaving, Li Qianyun said again: "Liu Wang Liming asked me to convey these opinions to you, please consider them."

Yang Meizhen, the wife of Zhang Naiqi, said at the group meeting that last year, when we went to West Germany together to attend the World Women's Temperance Union conference, Liu Wang Liming said in a speech in a church, "If I stay a few more days, I don't want to go back." Where did Liu Wang Liming not want to return to? She did not give an explanation at the meeting.

### 刘王立明是美国金元豢养的走卒

　　全国妇代会上剥开了这个右派分子迷惑人的外衣
　　刘王立明是美国金元豢养的走卒
　　直到一九五一年她还每月接受三百美金的津贴，解放以来她一直在宣扬美帝国主义的“实力政策”，积极参加章罗联盟的阴谋活动
    据新华社13日讯  出席中国妇女第三次全国代表大会的代表们，跟踪追击右派分子刘王立明。根据揭露的材料证明，这个似乎令人迷离难解的刘王立明，原来是一个拜倒在金元之下的为美帝国主义所豢养的忠实走卒，是一个同罗隆基鼻息相通狼狈为奸的老牌右派。
    在昨天和今天的大会及浙江省的小组会上，代表们对刘王立明进行了充分的揭露和批判。
    全国妇联书记处书记沈兹九在今天的大会上揭露说，刘王立明远在中国新民主主义革命阶段，就是一个老右派。她长期为美帝国主义所豢养，从解放前到现在，她利用中华妇女节制会和民盟这两个合法组织，充当了章罗联盟反共反人民的骨干，进行了一系列的政治阴谋活动。
    沈兹九说，解放前，刘王立明坚决主张走“中间路线”，企图保持美帝国主义势力在中国的统治。1947年正当革命战争节节胜利的时候，刘王立明在上海公开主张：“中共不要渡江。江北归中共，江南归国民党，中间划一中立区由联合国来管。”又说：“今天要和平，国共双方划出一条中立地带，请英美驻兵。”沈兹九认为刘王立明这种无耻行为，“同中国历史上的卖国贼没有什么两样”。
    解放以后，刘王立明公开为美帝国主义作宣传。1952年她竟利用赴朝慰问的机会，在中国人民志愿军面前宣扬美帝国主义的所谓“民主”。并且还在受伤的志愿军战士面前别有用心地煽动说：“可怜啊！为什么要战争！”沈兹九说，刘王立明说这种恶毒的话的目的，就是要破坏抗美援朝保家卫国的正义战争。
    沈兹九说，刘王立明还曾经亲自对她宣扬美帝国主义的“实力政策”，无耻地吹嘘美国的导弹如何如何厉害。
    沈兹九揭露，刘王立明从入盟那天起，就和罗隆基密切勾结，他们主张“中间路线”，反对民盟三中全会决议，反对民盟四中全会决议，种种活动都是一鼻孔出气的。当罗隆基和张东荪在1950年组织反共集团进行阴谋活动的时候，刘王立明配合他们的活动公开对苏联进行恶毒的诬蔑，并且把她的家当成了反共集团阴谋活动的“机关”。随后，她又把她的儿子刘光华也输送进去，充当了罗隆基的小喽啰。
    李公朴烈士的夫人张曼筠在今天的大会上揭露刘王立明说，刘王立明是一个道貌岸然的基督教徒，她口口声声喊“救人救己”，实际上却在害人害己。她所崇拜的“救世主”就是金元，她所向往的“天国”就是金元帝国。她从十九岁开始就投靠了美帝国主义，后来担任了美帝国主义御用的远东妇女节制会的工作，每月领取一百元美金的高薪和一百二十元美金的办公费，还继承了她一个美国“干妈妈”的遗产约一万美元。直到1951年，刘王立明还继续接受美帝国主义每月三百元美金的津贴。张曼筠说，美帝国主义的钱是不会白花的。通过刘王立明的手所花费的每一元美金，都包含着政治阴谋和政治目的。而刘王立明确实使金元充分发挥了作文化侵略的作用。
    张曼筠还说，资产阶级唯利是图的丑恶本质，也集中反映在刘王立明身上。刘王立明向来借口兴办儿童福利事业以歛聚钱财，充塞私囊。直到解放后，她还曾继续套购外汇，经营美钞黑市交易，借民盟总部的公款给奸商作投机生意，并且骗取给儿童乐园的捐款。
    张曼筠最后说，她在会场上看见不少烈士的妻子和烈士的妈妈，她很激动。她说她的丈夫是蒋介石反动派用美国的无声手枪打死的，刘王立明的丈夫是日本帝国主义暗杀的，这些杀夫之仇现在都由共产党给报了。她质问刘王立明说：今天你向共产党进攻，良心何在？
    北京师范大学第二附小校长、模范教师陶淑范在昨天下午的大会发言时，就刘王立明在高小毕业生的升学和青少年的出路等问题上所发表的荒谬言论进行了驳斥。刘王立明在今年3月间全国政协开会时，曾借中小学毕业生不能全部升学问题向共产党进攻。她曾说，不解决中小学毕业生升学问题，就要造成严重的后果，这严重的后果就是：儿童和青少年消极、苦闷和不满，家长们感到失望和增加负担，父母的工作效率就要降低，社会上游手好闲的人增加等等。她还说，高小毕业生的升学和高中毕业生的出路只有两条，就是当老师或当学生。
    陶淑范驳斥了刘王立明这些荒谬言论，她说，中小学毕业生不升学和失学根本是两回事，在我们社会主义国家里，教育方针是培养有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的、身体健康的劳动者，青少年在学校学习一个阶段，然后参加建设社会主义的体力劳动或脑力劳动，完全是正常现象。从几年来教育事业的发展来看，中小学发展的速度不但在我国历史上是空前的，在世界教育史上也是少有的。
    在刘王立明看来，不升学即当教师，这是唯一的出路，而把广大青年参加体力劳动视为是没有出路。陶淑范说，事实完全不是这样，在我们社会主义国家里，参加体力劳动同样是光荣的出路。刘王立明说不解决中小学生升学问题，就要有严重后果。陶淑范说，从半年多的事实来看，刘王立明估计错了。今年没有升学的中小学毕业生并未闹事，仅据辽宁省为例，到8月中旬，就有十三万五千多名本届中小学毕业生兴高采烈的参加了农业生产。
    在昨天和今天浙江小组举行会议时，很多熟悉刘王立明底细的人同她展开了针锋相对的斗争。
    刘王立明在两天小组会上的交代中，她扯谎欺人，避重就轻，极力回避与章罗联盟的关系。可是她又说，“成立妇女节制会成都分会是为了给章罗扩充声势，如果这个分会响应了章罗阴谋，我的罪就更大了”。
    刘王立明还狡赖她在成都将成立的妇女节制分会交给潘大逵领导是“因为成都妇联不领导”，狡赖她搜罗有政治问题的人作会员是“事先不了解”。成都妇联会主任王泽当场将这些狡辩一一揭开。王泽说，成都妇联从来没有讲过不领导节制会，而是因为成都分会的成立是非法的。刘王立明急不可待地找了潘大逵领导，表示她根本就不想让妇联领导。王泽还说：刘王立明说不知道分会这些人的政治面目更是无耻的谎言。成都分会成立后，连他们分会的人都自己嘲笑自己说：“简直是个劳改大队。”可是刘王立明一再说“没有关系”。
    廖静文还揭发刘王立明在整风开始时，派一个叫做李蒨云的人来她家进行放火造谣的事实。李蒨云说，刘王立明曾经讲，“现在人民生活很苦，吃糠吃菜”。又说：“人民大学有一个女孩子，下笔数万言、很有才干，在革命部队长大的，她有反党情绪，这能说是受别人煽动吗？”李蒨云还说：“共产党整风是用来整别人的”。临走时李蒨云又说：“刘王立明叫我转告你的这些意见，请你考虑考虑。”
    章乃器的妻子杨美真在小组会上说，去年，我们一同去西德出席世界妇女节制会会议时，刘王立明在一个教堂里讲话时说，“我再多呆几天，就不想回去了。”刘王立明不想回国要到那里去呢？会上她没有作出交代。
