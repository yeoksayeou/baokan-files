    Shanghai's Various Theaters and Troupes
    To Improve Performance Scheduling Starting in October
    The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture recently announced that, starting in October, all theaters and troupes in the city will implement the newly drafted "Trial Measures for Improving Performance Scheduling."

    These measures were formulated by the Municipal Bureau of Culture based on relevant opinions raised by troupes and theaters during the "Blooming and Contending" period, after repeated consultations, studies, and discussions in numerous meetings. Its characteristic is the implementation of voluntary combination under leadership. The main content is: Troupes' future performances will adopt a "1-3-8 system" (that is, in the twelve months of the year, one month will be spent performing in factories, rural areas, and military units in the city; three months will be spent touring outside the city; and eight months will be spent performing in the city's theaters). Small troupes, to take into account their special circumstances, will generally not be scheduled for tours. Old national-level theaters and troupes will create a business model combining the venue and the troupe, and will perform in fixed theaters starting in 1958. The Bureau of Culture will reserve some theaters specifically for visiting troupes from other regions to perform in Shanghai.

    上海市各剧团、剧场
    十月起改进演出调度工作
    上海市文化局最近宣布自10月份起在市内各剧团、剧场一律实行新拟定的“改进演出调度工作试行办法”。
    这个办法是市文化局根据剧团、剧场在鸣放中提出的有关意见，经过多次会议的反复协商、研究、讨论拟定的。它的特点是实行有领导地自愿结合。主要内容是：剧团今后的演出将采取“一、三、八制”（即在全年十二个月中，一个月在本市工厂、农村和部队演出，三个月赴外地巡回演出，八个月在本市剧场演出）。小型剧团为照顾其特殊情况，一般不安排巡回演出。老国家剧团、剧院将创造场、团合一经营，自1958年起，固定剧场演出。文化局保留部分剧场专供外地剧团来沪演出时使用。
