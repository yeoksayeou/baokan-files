    Actively Restore and Develop Private Salt Pan Lands
    Liu Hongxuan
    In China's coastal areas, there are approximately one million mu of salt pan lands that are either idle or abandoned, estimated to be capable of producing 500,000 tons of salt annually. The soil in these salt pan lands contains a high amount of salt, making it unsuitable for growing crops. However, the local salt workers and farmers have many years of salt-making experience and abundant production knowledge. Moreover, the coastal areas have limited arable land, and there is some surplus labor in the rural areas. Therefore, the State Council recently issued a directive encouraging salt industry (or agricultural) cooperatives to restore and develop these private salt pan lands. This way, "land is fully utilized, and people's talents are fully employed," which can both increase salt production to meet social needs and increase the income of salt workers and farmers, improving their lives.
    Because private salt pan lands have backward production methods, some people worry: if they are restored and developed now, will they be eliminated in the future? This concern is unnecessary. With the development of the chemical industry, especially the chemical fertilizer industry, and the expansion of export quantities, the demand for salt will continue to increase. At the same time, because salt production is affected by natural climate and production fluctuates, a certain amount of reserves must be maintained to prevent disasters. Therefore, the state adopts a policy of actively developing the salt-making industry. Although the production methods of private salt pan lands are relatively backward, they still play a significant role in supplying local people's food needs and supplementing the deficiencies of large and medium-sized salt fields. Therefore, they will coexist with the state-owned large and medium-sized salt fields for a long time, and the state will actively carry out technical transformations on them, without abandoning them.
    The State Council's directive states that private salt pan lands "should be restored primarily, and appropriately developed based on specific conditions." However, some people now believe that since development is allowed, it should be "greatly developed" unconditionally. This idea is obviously incorrect. The principle of prioritizing restoration for private salt pan lands is based on the economic capabilities and technical feasibility of the masses. Restoring salt pan lands or appropriately expanding on the existing salt pan lands not only allows full use of existing production equipment, but also involves smaller-scale projects, which can achieve the goal of "small investment, quick results." If the masses or cooperatives were to build new medium-sized salt fields, it would not only involve complex designs and massive projects but also require a lot of investment, which is beyond the capabilities of the masses and cooperatives. In Yangkou Salt Field, Shandong Province, the construction of approximately 6,000 mu of new salt pan lands required more than 160,000 workdays, with an investment of over 390,000 yuan. The cooperative could not afford it, and the entire investment was made by the government. Due to insufficient planning and overly large-scale projects, there was a waste and loss of approximately 30,000 yuan. After the salt field was completed, the cooperative was unwilling to accept it. The masses criticized, "The state spends a lot of money, the masses benefit little, the cooperative loses money, and the project is messed up." Such lessons should be learned.
    Restoring and developing private salt pan lands should also pay attention to conditions such as sales, transportation, and quality. Ignoring these conditions and blindly developing will result in increased production, but if it is neither needed locally nor transportable, it will tie up capital and affect production. If low-quality nitrate-containing salt is produced, it will also endanger people's health.
    The restoration and development of private salt pan lands must be carried out with unified planning, organization, and preparation. First, thorough investigation and research work should be done (complex projects should also conduct surveys), collect data, and develop restoration and development plans. First, restore and develop some salt pan lands with sufficient conditions and simple projects; those involving more issues and complex projects can be restored later. In arranging the surrounding environment of the salt pan lands, attention should be paid to combining it with agricultural water conservancy (such as whether drainage rivers for farmland affect the salt fields, whether the salt fields' brine reservoirs affect farmland, etc.), and appropriate arrangements should be made based on the principle of mutual benefit. During construction, attention should be paid to doing some non-urgent projects during production downtime, and try to minimize recruiting workers from outside the commune. Material purchases should also be sourced locally as much as possible, using existing materials within the commune.
    The masses' conscious willingness is an important principle for restoring and developing salt pan lands. It is necessary to explain clearly to the masses the state's policy of actively developing salt production and the main principles of restoration and development. Only when the masses have a desire to do it themselves, should we help them formulate plans. Liyu Village Agricultural Cooperative in Shandong Province did a good job. After the government approved it, the masses worked day and night to accelerate the progress of the project and restored 24 salt pan lands within 27 days.
    When formulating construction plans and carrying out construction, the masses should be repeatedly educated on "running the commune diligently and frugally," opposing the practice of "starting everything from scratch" and being greedy for quantity and scale without regard to actual capabilities. All expenses should be strictly saved, especially non-productive investments should be reduced as much as possible. For productive projects, do not over-emphasize centralization and standardization, or be too perfectionist, in order to reduce costs. Strive to apply for fewer loans and subsidies from the government. Zhu Gao Cooperative in Shandong Province implemented the spirit of thrift and kept a tight grip on expenses. The construction cost per ton was only four yuan, which was four-fifths or three-quarters less than other fields. It is hoped that the Party and government leading organs in the areas where these private salt pan lands are located will strengthen their leadership over the salt industry (agricultural) cooperatives and help solve the organizational mobilization, financial, and material difficulties that the masses encounter in the work of restoring and building salt pan lands. It is hoped that the local salt affairs departments will provide guidance in business and technology and specifically help the cooperatives with planning and design. Once the production season arrives, the products should be purchased in a timely manner to prevent salt from flowing into the free market.

### 积极恢复和发展民营盐滩

　　积极恢复和发展民营盐滩
　　刘洪轩
    在我国的沿海地区，有一百万公亩左右的停晒或荒废的盐滩，估计每年可产盐五十万吨。这些盐滩上的土壤有很多的盐分，不能种庄稼。而当地的盐民和农民，有多年的晒盐习惯和丰富的生产经验；沿海地区可耕土地不多，农村中又有一些闲余劳动力。因此，国务院在最近发布了一个指示，提倡盐业（或农业）合作社把这些民营盐滩恢复和发展起来。这样，就可以“地尽其用，人尽其才”，既增加盐的生产，满足社会需要；又可以增加盐民和农民的收入，改善他们的生活。
    因为民营盐滩生产方式落后，有人怀疑：现在恢复、发展了，将来是否会裁废呢？这种顾虑是不必要的。因为随着化学工业特别是化学肥料工业的发展，以及出口数量的扩大，盐的需要量将愈来愈大；同时，由于盐的生产受自然气候影响，生产是波浪式的，必须有一定的储备来防止灾歉。因此国家对制盐工业采取了积极发展的方针。民营盐滩的生产方式虽然比较落后，但它在供应当地民食需要，辅助大中盐场的不足等方面仍有相当重要的作用。因此它也将和国家经营的大、中型盐场长期并存，国家将对他们积极的进行技术改造，不会加以废弃。
    国务院指示中说，民营盐滩“应以恢复为主，并根据具体条件适当发展”。但是，现在有一些人认为：既然允许发展，就应该无条件的“大大发展一下”。这种想法显然是不对的。民营盐滩以恢复为主的原则，是根据群众的经济能力和技术可能性提出来的。因为恢复盐滩或在现有盐滩基础上适当扩大，不但原有生产设备可以充分运用，而且工程规模较小，可以收到“投资小，收效快”的目的。如果由群众或合作社来新建中型盐场，不但设计复杂，工程浩大，而且投资很多，是群众和合作社力不能及的。山东省羊口场新建了约六千亩的盐滩，需用十六万多个工，投资额达三十九万余元，合作社负担不了，全部由政府投资。由于计划不够周密，工程过于庞大，浪费损失约三万余元，盐场建成后，合作社还不愿接受。群众批评说“国家花钱多，群众得利少，合作社赔了钱，工程搞糟了。”这样的教训是应当吸取的。
    恢复与发展民营盐滩，还应当注意销售、运输和质量等条件，如果无视这些条件，盲目发展，结果虽然产品增加了，但当地既不需要，外运又无办法，反而积压资金，影响生产。如果生产品质低劣的硝土盐，还要危害人民健康。
    恢复和发展民营盐滩，必须统一规划，有组织、有准备地进行。首先应当做好调查研究工作（工程复杂的还应当进行勘察工作），搜集资料，作出恢复和发展的计划。先恢复和发展一些条件充分、工程简单的盐滩；牵涉较多、工程复杂的，可以缓一步恢复。在盐滩周围环境的安排上，要注意与农业水利相结合（如农田的排水河是否影响盐场，盐场的咸水库是否影响农田等等），应当在互利的原则下作适当的安排。在施工的时候，要注意把一些非急办的工程放在生产空隙时间来做，尽量减少向社外招工。物料购置也尽可能就地取材，运用社内的现存的物料。
    群众自觉自愿，是恢复和发展盐滩的一项重要原则。必须把国家积极发展盐业生产的方针和恢复发展的主要原则向群众解释清楚，当群众有了自办要求以后，再帮助他们制订计划。山东省利渔村农业合作社就办得好，当政府批准之后，群众披星戴月地加赶工程进度，二十七天之内就恢复了二十四处盐滩。
    在制订施工计划和进行施工时，要向群众反复进行“勤俭办社”的教育，反对不根据实际能力而“百废俱兴”贪多、贪大的做法，严格的节约各项费用，特别是应当尽量压缩非生产性的投资，对于生产性的工程也不要过于强调集中化正规化，过于求全求美，以降低造价。争取少向政府申请贷款和补助。山东省朱皋合作社贯彻了节约精神，抓紧了费用开支，每吨的建造费只有四元，比其他场要少五分之四或四分之三。希望这些民营盐滩所在地的党政领导机关，加强对盐业（农业）合作社的领导，帮助解决群众在复滩和建滩工作中的组织动员和财力物质方面的困难。希望当地盐务部门在业务上、技术上加以指导，具体帮助合作社进行规划和设计。当进入生产季节之后，要及时收购产品，不要让食盐流入自由市场。
