Inheriting a Glorious Tradition and Defending the Fruits of the Revolution
The Hungarian Workers' Militia is Growing Stronger

The Hungarian Workers' Militia was quickly established after the counter-revolutionary rebellion was suppressed last year. Now it has greatly developed. There are thirty battalions of workers' militia in Budapest, with 12,000 worker members. The Workers' Militia is composed of advanced workers.

The Hungarian people affectionately call the militiamen "Lenin's children." Today, inheriting the glorious tradition, the Workers' Militia is a strong force for the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the government to defend the fruits of the revolution. (Attached pictures)

    承继光荣传统　保卫革命成果
    匈牙利工人自卫队日益壮大
    匈牙利工人自卫队，在去年反革命叛乱被镇压下去以后很快就诞生了。现在已有了很大发展，在布达佩斯就有三十个营工人自卫队，有一万二千名工人队员。工人自卫队是由先进工人组成的。
    匈牙利人民曾亲切地把自卫队员称作“列宁的孩子”。今天，继承了光荣传统的工人自卫队，又是匈牙利社会主义工人党和政府保卫革命成果的一支坚强的队伍。（附图片）
