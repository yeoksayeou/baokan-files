Xinhua News Agency, September 27th - Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife hosted a banquet tonight to welcome Chairman Fierlinger and his wife, along with the delegation of the Czechoslovak National Assembly he leads, and Mayor Svoboda and his wife, along with the delegation of the Prague Central People's Committee he leads.

Liu Shaoqi spoke at the banquet, extending a warm welcome on behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Chinese people to the distinguished guests.

Liu Shaoqi said that the Czechoslovak Republic is one of the staunch members of the socialist camp. The high level of industrial development in Czechoslovakia has not only laid a solid material foundation for further developing the national economy and continuously improving the people's living standards, but also greatly enhanced the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The people of China and Czechoslovakia have a deep and unbreakable friendship. It is particularly worth mentioning that in the process of our socialist industrialization, your country has supplied us with many industrial equipment and sent many excellent experts to help us with construction. We will never forget this sincere assistance. I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to you, and through you to the Czechoslovak people, on behalf of the Chinese people.

Liu Shaoqi said that we firmly believe that your visit to our country will further develop the fraternal friendship between the people of the two countries, strengthen friendly cooperation, and benefit the cause of consolidating the unity of the socialist camp and defending world peace.

Chairman Fierlinger also spoke at the banquet, expressing his gratitude for the host's hospitality. He spoke of the great achievements made by the Czechoslovak people in economic and cultural construction, and of the fraternal mutual assistance between China and Czechoslovakia. He pointed out that this relationship will be further developed.

Fierlinger said that the important reason why we feel strong and powerful in building socialism is that we are members of a strong and invincible socialist camp. This camp is headed by the great Soviet Union, and People's China is also a strong pillar of this camp. Czechoslovakia, together with the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, now has more than one billion people, which is an extremely great force.

Fierlinger pointed out that our cause is built on the great ideals of the October Revolution, on the great ideals of realizing freedom and equality for all nations, and therefore the foreign policies of the socialist countries are common. This policy encourages the people's struggle for independence. It makes people believe that there can be no war, and it attracts progressive and peace-loving people all over the world like a magnet.

Fierlinger said that all cultured and progressive humanity around the world regards People's China as a legitimate member of the United Nations, and therefore the US policy of excluding People's China from the United Nations is bound to fail.

Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Mayor of Beijing, proposed a toast at the meeting. He proposed a toast to the friendship between the people of China and Czechoslovakia, and to the friendship between the people of Beijing and Prague.

Svoboda said in his speech that wherever the people are in charge, wherever there is a Communist Party that has been tested and tempered in battle, the people there are invincible. We are all very fortunate because we all live in a place where the people can write their own history and transform their motherland into a place with the most just social system with their own hands. Every achievement we make is met with hatred and jealousy from our enemies, but with admiration and support from workers and progressive humanity all over the world, which is precisely where our strength lies. He said that all workers around the world should continue to fight for our great common cause, and we will surely achieve final victory.

During the banquet, the hosts and guests repeatedly toasted to the eternal friendship between the people of China and Czechoslovakia, to the prosperity of the two countries and the happiness of the people, and to the health of the leaders of the two countries.

Czechoslovak Ambassador to China, Bušniak, and his wife were also invited to the banquet.

Also present at the banquet tonight were Li Jishen and Shen Junru, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Li Xiannian, Member of the Standing Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, Zeng Yongquan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, various Vice Mayors of Beijing, heads of various people's organizations, and well-known figures from all walks of life.

Xinhua News Agency, September 27th - Chairman Fierlinger and his wife, along with the delegation of the Czechoslovak National Assembly he leads, and Mayor Svoboda and his wife, along with the delegation of the Prague Central People's Committee he leads, paid a visit to Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife at 7:00 PM today.

    刘委员长欢宴捷议会代表团
    费林格主席斯沃波达市长拜会刘委员长
    据新华社27日讯　刘少奇委员长和夫人今晚举行宴会，欢迎费林格主席和夫人以及他所率领的捷克斯洛伐克国民议会代表团，和斯沃波达市长和夫人以及他所率领的布拉格市中央人民委员会代表团。
    刘少奇在宴会上讲话，他代表全国人民代表大会常务委员会和中国人民向贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎。
    刘少奇说，捷克斯洛伐克共和国是社会主义阵营中坚强的成员之一。捷克斯洛伐克工业的高度发展，不仅为进一步发展国民经济和继续不断地提高人民的生活水平奠定了巩固的物质基础，而且大大增强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量。中、捷两国人民有着深厚的牢不可破的友谊。特别值得提出的是，在我们实现社会主义工业化的过程中，你们的国家供给了我们许多工业装备，并且派遣了许多优秀的专家帮助我们进行建设。这种真诚的援助是我们永远不能忘记的。我愿借此机会，代表中国人民向你们，并通过你们向捷克斯洛伐克人民表示衷心的感谢。
    刘少奇说，我们深信，你们这次来我国的访问，必将进一步发展两国人民的兄弟友谊，加强两国的友好合作，并且有利于巩固社会主义阵营团结和保卫世界和平的事业。
    费林格主席也在宴会上讲了话，他对主人的盛情招待表示感谢。他谈到了捷克斯洛伐克人民在经济、文化建设方面所取得的巨大成就，谈到了中捷两国之间的兄弟般的互助关系。他指出这种关系必将得到进一步的发展。
    费林格说，我们在建设社会主义中所以感到强大有力，很重要的一个原因是：我们是强大的、不可战胜的社会主义阵营的成员。这个阵营以伟大的苏联为首，人民中国也是这个阵营的强大支柱。捷克斯洛伐克现在同苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家合计在一起，就有十亿以上人口，这是一支极其伟大的力量。
    费林格指出，我们的事业建立在十月革命伟大理想的基础上，建立在实现一切民族自由平等的伟大理想的基础上，因此各个社会主义国家的外交政策是共同的。这个政策鼓励人民争取独立的斗争。它使人民相信可以不要战争，它像磁石一样吸引住了全世界进步的、爱好和平的人们。
    费林格说，全世界有文化的、进步人类都把人民中国看成是联合国的合法的成员，因之，美国把人民中国排挤在联合国外的政策一定要失败。
    全国人民代表大会常委会副委员长、北京市市长彭真在会上祝酒。他提议为中捷两国人民，为北京市和布拉格市人民的友谊干杯。
    斯沃波达在会上讲话时说，凡是人民当家作主的地方，凡是有在战斗中经受考验、锻炼出来的共产党的地方，那里的人民就是不可战胜的。我们都非常幸运，因为我们都生活在人民能自己写自己的历史，能用自己的双手把祖国改造成具有最正义的社会制度的地方。我们每取得一项成就，都受到敌人的仇恨和嫉妒，但是却得到了全世界工人和进步人类的钦佩和支持，这正是我们力量的所在。他说，全世界所有工人都应该为我们伟大的共同事业继续奋斗，我们一定能取得最后胜利。
    席间，宾主频频为中捷两国人民永恒的友谊，为两国的繁荣和人民的幸福，为两国国家领导人的健康干杯。
    捷克斯洛伐克驻中国大使布希尼亚克和夫人也应邀出席了宴会。
    出席今晚宴会的，还有全国人民代表大会常委会副委员长李济深、沈钧儒和委员、国务院副总理李先念，外交部副部长曾涌泉和北京市各位副市长，各人民团体负责人和各界著名人士。
