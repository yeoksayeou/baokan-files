    The Syrian People Have Prepared Graves for the Invaders
    Cheng Liangping
    Those who have been to Damascus all say it is one of the most beautiful and ancient cities in the world, and September in Damascus is the best time of the year. September in Damascus is not only blessed with gentle breezes and sunshine and captivating scenery, but also the opening of the Fourth Damascus International Fair, which makes the city even more prosperous. It is said that the Damascus International Fair received 1.3 million foreign guests last year, more than three times the city's population.

    These days, as I walk through the streets of Damascus, past cinemas, theaters, schools, or any corner, I see smiles on people's faces and hear their laughter everywhere. In the streets and alleys of Damascus, many advertisements have been posted about the performances of the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe and the famous Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum here. As the sun sets and the red glow envelops the western sky, people flock like a tide to the Damascus International Fair Center to view the exhibits from various countries and the artistic performances of some countries. In the evening, beautiful Damascus is adorned with colorful neon lights, dazzling colored fountains, and fireworks, making it extraordinarily beautiful.

    How much the Syrian people wish they could live forever in an atmosphere of peace and joy! They wish that the beautiful September would never leave their homeland, their native soil. However, in addition to their joy, the Syrian people deeply feel that the peace they cherish is now under serious threat. This is because the imperialists, especially the US imperialists, are not reconciled to their failure in the Arab world, and they are now trying every possible means to undermine Syria through internal and external attacks, thereby isolating Egypt in order to exploit the entire Middle East.

    Since the Syrian authorities cracked the major US spy case in mid-August this year, the US's conspiratorial activities around Syria have intensified and become more blatant. The US has not only recently launched a propaganda offensive targeting Syria, continuing to instigate conspiracies against Syria within Syria and in some surrounding Arab countries, but has also sent Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson to the Middle East under the guise of a so-called "fact-finding mission" to carry out a series of conspiratorial activities. Some time ago, US warships and aircraft even openly "showed force" to the Syrian government and people, carrying out military provocations.

    However, the Syrian people are increasingly aware of one truth: peace cannot be granted by the imperialists. I recently attended the Arab Women's Conference held in Damascus and a series of mass rallies held to expose and condemn the subversive conspiracies of US imperialism. These gatherings show that the peace-loving Syrian people, who are currently standing at the forefront of the struggle, not only understand the meaning of peace but also know how to defend it.

    These days, although I did not participate in the mass rallies and demonstrations held in cities such as Aleppo, Hama, and Homs, I heard the Arab people's loud response to the provocative actions of US imperialism at some mass rallies in Damascus. Almost every venue of the mass rallies was adorned with large banners that read: "The army and the people unite as one," "Thoroughly eliminate the agents of imperialism," "Defeat the new conspiracy of US imperialism against Syria!"

    At each rally, when well-known Syrian peace activists, famous poets, writers, trade union leaders, and professors stepped onto the podium amidst the cheers of the masses to expose the US imperialist conspiracies against Syria, you could see the anger towards the US aggression conspiracies in the facial expressions of every participant, but when the speakers used their skilled satirical tone to depict the ugly face of US imperialism and its embarrassing situation in the Middle East, you could feel the Arab people's full confidence in defeating the imperialist conspiracies in the laughter and cheers of the people. All speakers pointed out that the strong unity of the Syrian people and army, the mutual support of the entire Arab people, and the support of peace-loving people all over the world, especially the people of the Soviet Union and China, will surely smash the imperialist conspiracies and completely crush the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

    Representatives from all walks of life in Damascus have also recently refuted the so-called "communist infiltration" argument at various gatherings. They pointed out that what Syria adheres to is the Arab national liberation and the foreign policy of active neutrality, but they deeply thank the Soviet Union, China, and the peace-loving people of the world for their economic and moral assistance and support for the just cause of the Arab people. As soon as the speakers mentioned the Soviet Union and China, thunderous applause erupted from the venue, and when the masses cheered "Long live Soviet-Arab friendship!" and "Long live Chinese-Arab friendship!", they always shouted "A'eesh," "A'eesh," "A'eesh" (meaning Long live! Long live! Long live!) three times. Indeed, the Syrian people are now increasingly clearly distinguishing who are their friends and who are their enemies. The imperialist rumors not only cannot deceive the Arab people now, but on the contrary, will only arouse greater anger among the people.

    In recent days, as long as you open the Syrian newspapers, you will see a lot of news about the support of the Soviet Union, China, and the people of other peace-loving countries for the Syrian people's struggle, including the Soviet Union's note to the West, and the articles published recently by Chinese and Soviet newspapers supporting the Syrian struggle. Wherever you go to talk to Syrians, they express their heartfelt gratitude for the support of the Soviet and Chinese people.

    The Syrian people are now closely watching the development of the situation, watching the new conspiracies planned by the United States within Syria and through certain countries around it directed by the West, and continuing to expose the various excuses created by the United States for planning new conspiracies. At the same time, the Syrian people, who have experience in fighting imperialism, are now confidently preparing to defend their country's independence and Middle East peace at all costs. A Syrian youth said to me at a mass rally: "The policy of strength of US imperialism cannot scare us. If the United States dares to launch a war against Syria, it will suffer the same fate as it suffered during the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt. What awaits it here is nothing but the grave of the invaders." I think, if someone asks me about the Syrian people's attitude towards the US aggression conspiracies, I think this young man expressed the entire Syrian people's determination and strong will to oppose US aggression and defend Middle East peace.

### 叙利亚人民给侵略者准备好了坟墓

    叙利亚人民给侵略者准备好了坟墓
    程良平
    到过大马士革的人都说它是世界上最美丽而古老的城市之一，而大马士革的9月又是它一年当中最美好的时光。9月的大马士革不仅是风和日丽、景色诱人，而且还由于第四届大马士革国际博览会的开幕，使得这个城市呈现出更加繁荣的景象。据说，大马士革国际博览会去年接待了一百三十万外国客人，超过了这个城市人口的三倍以上。
    这些天来，当我走在大马士革的街头，走过电影院、戏院、学校或其他任何一个角落，到处都发现人们脸上浮现出笑容，听到人们的欢笑声。在大马士革的街头巷间张贴了许多有关中国杂技艺术团和埃及著名的女歌唱家奥木·克露松在这里演出的广告。当夕阳落山，红霞笼罩西天的时候，人们就像潮水一样地涌往大马士革国际博览馆中心去观看各国的展览品和一些国家的艺术表演。晚上，美丽的大马士革镶嵌了五光十色的霓虹灯、光彩夺目的彩色喷泉和焰火，显得分外美丽。
    叙利亚人民是多么愿望他们能够永远地生活在和平与欢乐的氛围中啊！他们愿望美丽的9月永远也不离开他们的祖国、他们的乡土。但是，叙利亚人民在欢乐之余，却深深地感到他们所热爱着的和平今天又受到严重的威胁了。这是由于帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义不甘心它们在阿拉伯世界的失败，它们现在正千方百计地企图通过内外夹攻的办法来搞垮叙利亚，从而孤立埃及，以便鱼肉整个中东。
    自从今年8月中叙利亚当局破获了美国大间谍案以后，美国在叙利亚周围的阴谋活动更加加紧，而且方式也更加露骨了。美国不仅在最近发动了一个矛头针对叙利亚的宣传攻势，继续在叙利亚内部和周围一些阿拉伯国家策动反对叙利亚的阴谋，并且还在所谓“事实调查”的名义下派遣了副国务卿帮办汉德逊到中东进行了一系列阴谋活动。前些时候，美国军舰和飞机更公然向叙利亚政府和人民“显示武力”，进行了军事挑衅。
    但是，叙利亚人民越来越懂得了一条真理：和平是不可能要求帝国主义赐予的。我最近参加了在大马士革举行的阿拉伯妇女大会和一系列为揭露和谴责美帝国主义颠覆阴谋而召开的群众集会。这些集会表明：目前站在斗争最前线的、热爱和平的叙利亚人民，他们不仅仅懂得和平的意义，而且懂得怎样保卫和平。
    这些天来，我虽然没有参加在阿勒颇、哈马和荷姆斯等城市举行的群众集会和示威游行，但是我从大马士革的一些群众集会上听到了阿拉伯人民对美帝国主义挑衅行为的响亮回答。几乎每一个群众集会的会场的主席台上都横挂着大幅标语，上面写着：“军队和人民团结起来”，“彻底肃清帝国主义的代理人”，“击败美帝国主义对叙利亚的新阴谋！”
    在每次集会上，当叙利亚知名的和平人士、著名的诗人、作家、工会领袖和教授等在群众欢呼声中走上讲台揭露美帝国主义对叙利亚的侵略阴谋的时候，你都可以从每个与会者的面部表情里看到他们对美国侵略阴谋的愤怒的情绪，但是当讲演人以他们擅长的讽刺口吻刻画出美帝国主义的丑恶面貌和在中东的狼狈形状时，你又会从人们的笑声和欢呼声中体会到阿拉伯人民对击败帝国主义阴谋具有十足的信心。所有发言者都指出，叙利亚人民和军队的坚强团结，整个阿拉伯人民的相互支持，以及全世界爱好和平人民、特别是苏联和中国人民的支持，一定可以击破帝国主义的阴谋，一定能够彻底地粉碎“艾森豪威尔主义”。
    大马士革各界代表最近还在各种集会上驳斥了所谓“共产主义渗透”的说法。他们指出，叙利亚所坚持的是阿拉伯民族解放和积极中立的外交政策，但是他们深深感谢苏联、中国以及世界爱好和平的人民在经济上和道义上对于阿拉伯人民正义事业的援助和支持。发言者只要一提到苏联和中国，会场上顿时就响起了雷动般的掌声，群众在欢呼“苏联—阿拉伯人民友谊万岁！”和“中国—阿拉伯人民友谊万岁！”的口号时，紧接着总要高呼三声“阿希”、“阿希”、“阿希”（即万岁！万岁！万岁！）。的确，叙利亚人民现在越来越清楚地明辨出谁是他们的朋友，谁是他们的敌人。帝国主义的造谣现在不但欺骗不了阿拉伯人民，相反地只会激起人民的更大愤怒。
    近几天来，你只要打开叙利亚报纸，你就会看到很多关于苏联、中国以及其它爱好和平国家人民支持叙利亚人民斗争的消息，其中包括苏联给西方的照会，中国和苏联报纸最近发表的支持叙利亚斗争的文章。随便到什么地方同叙利亚人谈起话来，他们对于苏联和中国人民的支持都表示衷心感谢。
    叙利亚人民现在正密切地注视着局势的发展，注视着美国在叙利亚内部和通过周围某些受西方指使的国家所策划的新阴谋，并且在继续揭露美国为策划新阴谋所制造的各种借口。同时，具有同帝国主义斗争经验的叙利亚人民，现在正满怀信心地准备不惜以一切代价来保卫自己祖国独立和中东的和平。有一个叙利亚青年在一次群众集会上对我说：“美帝国主义的实力政策吓不倒我们。如果美国敢于对叙利亚发动战争的话，它将会遭到英法侵略埃及期间所遭受到的同样命运。这里等待它的不是别的东西，而是侵略者的坟墓。”我想，如果有人要问我叙利亚人民对于美国侵略阴谋的态度的话，我认为这位青年表达了整个叙利亚人民为反对美国侵略和保卫中东和平的决心和坚强意志。（9月12日）
