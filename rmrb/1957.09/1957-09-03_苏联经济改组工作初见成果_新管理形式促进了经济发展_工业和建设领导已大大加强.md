Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 2nd: According to Soviet newspapers, since the 105 National Economic Councils of the Soviet economic regions began their work on July 1st, they have done much to strengthen the leadership of industrial and construction enterprises, improve the specialization and collaboration of enterprises, and unleash production potential. Their work results and experience prove that the implementation of new management forms is necessary and will greatly promote the development of the Soviet national economy.

After reorganizing the management system of industry and construction, the Soviet Union has reduced many management departments and agencies that were originally established by the government's specialized ministries for vertical leadership, and now the National Economic Councils directly lead enterprises according to economic regions. This not only saves the country a lot of administrative management costs and streamlines non-production personnel, but also enables the industrial and construction management work of most economic regions to begin to eliminate the bureaucratic habits and red tape of the past. For the past two months, the staff of the National Economic Councils of various economic regions have no longer relied on reports to understand the situation and conduct leadership work, but have gone directly to industrial enterprises and construction sites to conduct in-depth and specific research on production problems and needs, and solve them in a timely manner. The National Economic Councils of Moscow, Leningrad, Sverdlovsk, Saratov, Gorky, Estonia, Rostov and other economic regions have recently solved many important production problems for their affiliated enterprises. The staff of the Gorky Economic Region's National Economic Council have spent most of their time in enterprises for the past two months, and have studied and taken many measures to improve the production situation of the enterprises. From the first day of its work, the Rostov Economic Region's National Economic Council has focused its main attention on helping many enterprises and construction sites that have not completed their production tasks; many experts and staff members, led by the chairman and vice-chairman of the National Economic Council, often go deep into these enterprises to study the reasons for backward production with the workers of each enterprise, and timely implement measures to improve labor organization and increase productivity. In the Stalinno, Odessa, Kharkov, Kiev and other economic regions, the National Economic Councils have also taken many measures to rapidly improve the utilization of existing equipment in enterprises and the production technology of enterprises.

The problems of industrial enterprises' specialization and collaboration, which have not been well resolved for a long time, have now received special attention in various economic regions. The Sverdlovsk Economic Region recently merged many metallurgical plants with coking plants and iron mines that are closely related to them in production, and established new metallurgical joint factories in Nizhny Tagil, Alapaevsk, Kirovgrad and other places. In addition, it is also planned to concentrate the welding rod production tasks of the original thirty factories in the economic region to two or three factories in Sverdlovsk, so that the remaining twenty or so factories can specialize in other production. The Armenian Economic Region merged copper smelters, chemical factories, cement factories and lime factories that were previously managed by several industrial ministries and were closely related in production into two joint factories, which will greatly tap the production potential of these factories.

Due to the improvement of economic management and the strengthening of the development of enterprise specialization and collaboration, the production potential of existing enterprises has been greatly unleashed. Many industrial enterprises in various economic regions have over-fulfilled the state's production of a large number of products. The construction enterprises in the Tula Economic Region, which have never completed the state's construction tasks for many years, have recently completed the construction plan for the first time and greatly reduced construction costs.

    苏联经济改组工作初见成果
    新管理形式促进了经济发展  工业和建设领导已大大加强
    据新华社莫斯科2日电  据苏联报纸报道：苏联一百零五个经济区的国民经济委员会从7月1日开始工作以来，在加强对工业和建设企业的领导、改进企业的专业化和协作以及发挥生产潜力等方面已经进行了许多工作。它们的工作成果和经验证明，实行新的管理形式是必要的，它将大大促进苏联国民经济的发展。
    在改组了工业和建设的管理制度以后，苏联已经裁减了原先由政府各专门部进行垂直领导时所设立的许多管理部门和机构，而按经济地区由各国民经济委员会对企业进行直接领导。这不但为国家节省了大量行政管理费用和精简了非生产人员，而且使得绝大多数经济区的工业和建设管理工作能够着手消除过去的官僚主义习气和文牍主义的工作方法。两个月来，各经济区国民经济委员会的工作人员不再依靠表报来了解情况和进行领导工作，而直接到各工业企业和建筑工地深入地、具体地研究生产中的问题和需要，并且及时地加以解决。莫斯科、列宁格勒、斯维德洛夫斯克、萨拉托夫、高尔基、爱沙尼亚、罗斯托夫等经济区的国民经济委员会，最近已经为所属的企业解决了许多重要的生产问题。高尔基经济区国民经济委员会的工作人员两个月来大部分时间都在企业中进行工作，并且研究和采取了许多措施来改进企业的生产情况。罗斯托夫经济区国民经济委员会从开始工作的第一天起就把主要注意力放在帮助许多没有完成生产任务的企业和建筑工地上；以国民经济委员会主席和副主席为首的许多专家和工作人员经常深入这些企业，同各企业的职工一起研究生产落后的原因，并且及时实行了改善劳动组织和提高生产率的措施。在斯大林诺、敖德萨、哈尔科夫、基辅等经济区，各国民经济委员会还采取许多办法来迅速改进企业现有设备的利用情况和企业的生产技术。
    长期以来未能很好解决的工业企业的专业化和协作问题，现在已经受到各经济区的特别注意。斯维德洛夫斯克经济区最近把许多冶金工厂同那些在生产上和它们有密切联系的炼焦厂和铁矿合并起来，并且在下塔吉尔、阿拉帕耶夫斯克、基洛夫格勒等地成立了新的冶金联合工厂。此外，还准备把经济区原先三十个工厂的电焊条生产任务都集中交给斯维德洛夫城的两、三个工厂去完成，以便让其余二十多个工厂专门从事其他生产。亚美尼亚经济区把过去属于几个工业部管理的、生产上联系很密切的炼铜厂、化学工厂、水泥厂和石灰厂合并成两个联合工厂，这样就能够大大发掘这些工厂的生产潜力。
    由于改进经济管理和加强发展企业的专业化和协作，现有企业的生产潜力已经得到很大的发挥。各经济区的许多工业企业都超计划为国家多生产了大量的产品，多年来从未完成国家的建筑任务的图拉经济区的建筑企业最近也头一次完成了建设计划，并且大大降低了建筑成本。
