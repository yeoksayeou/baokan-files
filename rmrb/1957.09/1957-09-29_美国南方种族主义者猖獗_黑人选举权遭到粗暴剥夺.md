    Rampant Racism in the American South
    Black People's Right to Vote Brutally Deprived
    (Report from this newspaper) According to a report in the New York "Times Weekly," the deprivation of black people's right to vote is extremely serious in four states in the heart of the American South and remote areas where black people make up the majority of the population.
    In thirteen counties in Mississippi, where black people account for more than 50% of the population, only fourteen black people voted in 1954, while in another five counties, no black people were allowed to vote. In rural areas of Alabama, there are nine counties where not a single black person is on the voter registration rolls. In Louisiana, there are four parishes (equivalent to counties) where not a single black person voted. In the agricultural areas of Georgia, only a handful of black people are allowed to register in five counties.
    Five states in the American South still collect poll taxes, using them to make things difficult for black people and deprive them of the opportunity to register. In the Deep South and many other agricultural areas of the South, white officials at voter registration offices have the power to accept or reject voter registration. They sometimes use simple excuses such as "the registration book is not here" or "the registration form cannot be found" to avoid registering black people. In addition to these difficulties, black people also have to pass tests of literacy and knowledge of the Constitution, answering questions such as: From what date did the Tenth Amendment come into effect; from what date did Oklahoma become a state of the United States. In Northampton County, North Carolina, a black woman was asked to recite the state constitution and was deemed unqualified because she "mispronounced a few words."
    Even if they are lucky enough to register, they may not get a ballot. A "Citizens' Council" was established in Ouachita Parish, Louisiana, to "review" the voter rolls. It ordered 3,500 registered black voters to go to the registration office within ten days to "prove their identity," but when they went, the registration office claimed to be too busy and only received fifty people each day. As a result, those who were not received lost their eligibility to vote.
    In the remote areas of the South, black people who insist on their voting rights are often subjected to intimidation and severe economic retaliation. In one county in South Carolina, some black sharecroppers were treated as follows after registering: no white people would buy their agricultural products. A black businessman in Mississippi could not get credit after registering.
    In some places, black voters are subjected to direct threats of violence. In Liberty County, Florida, the first ten black people registered last year were subjected to a series of threats from the Ku Klux Klan, such as burning crosses in front of them, throwing bombs at them, and shooting at their homes. In the end, nine of these ten people had to remove their names from the voter list. In 1954, a black pastor in Mississippi was shot and killed for refusing to remove his name from the voter list, but the coroner's verdict remained that he died "accidentally." In Tensas Parish, Louisiana, none of the 4,500 black people were registered, and only one black person recently attempted to register. The registration official took him to see a court official. The official asked him: "Are you unhappy here? Is there anything wrong with the way things are handled here? If you are unhappy, we can find a way for you to leave." The black man quickly replied that he was doing well and that it was a mistake that he wanted to register. Although this black man stayed where he was, his wife lost her job.

### 美国南方种族主义者猖獗  黑人选举权遭到粗暴剥夺

    美国南方种族主义者猖獗
    黑人选举权遭到粗暴剥夺
    本报讯　据纽约“时代周刊”报道，黑人占居民大部分的美国南方腹地四个州及边远地区剥夺黑人选举权情况十分严重。
    密士失必州黑人占人口50％以上的十三个县中，1954年只有十四个黑人投了票，而在另外的五个县里，一个黑人也不准投票。亚拉巴马州农村地区内有九个县的选民登记册中一个黑人也没有。路易斯安那州有四个郡（相当于县）中没有一个黑人投票。佐治亚农业地区内有五个县只准屈指可数的几个黑人登记。
    美国南方有五个州仍在征收人头税，利用它来刁难黑人，使他们失掉登记的机会。在极南部的地区和南部其他许多农业地区，选民登记处的白人官员掌握了接受或拒绝选民登记的大权，他们有时用推说“登记册不在”或“登记表找不到”的简单借口，就不给黑人登记。除了这些刁难以外，黑人还得通过文化程度和宪法知识的考验，答复这样一类的问题：第十修正案从哪一天起开始生效；俄克拉何马从哪一天起成为美国的一个州。北卡罗来纳州北安普敦县要一个黑人妇女朗诵该州宪法，由于她“有几个字的读音不正确”而被认为不合格。
    既使幸而登了记，也不一定拿得到选票。路易斯安那州瓜奇塔郡成立了一个“公民委员会”来“审查”选民名册，它责成三千五百个已登记的黑人选民在十天内到登记处“证明身份”，但当他们去时，登记处却以工作太忙为借口，每天只接待五十个。结果未能被接待的都又失去了选举资格。
    在南部边远地区，坚持选民资格的黑人时常遭到恫吓和猛烈的经济报复的压力。南卡罗来纳州一个县有些黑人佃农在登记以后的遭遇是：没有白人肯买他们的农产品。密士失必州一个经商的黑人在登记以后借不到信用贷款。
    在某些地方，黑人选民遭到直接的暴力威胁。佛罗里达州自由县去年首批登记的十个黑人，受到了三K党徒的一系列的威胁，如在他们面前焚毁十字架、对他们投掷炸弹并向他们的住宅开枪等等，最后这十个人中的九个只得把自己的名字从选民名单上划掉。1954年密士失必州一个黑人牧师由于拒绝从选民名单中划掉自己的名字而被枪杀，然而验尸的结果仍然维持原判，说他是“意外身死”。路易斯安那州坦萨斯郡四千五百个黑人都没有登记，只有一个黑人最近试图登记。登记处的官员把他带去见法院的官员。官员问他：“你在这里过得不如意吗？此地处理事情的情况有什么不对头的地方吗？你要是觉得不如意，我们可以想办法让你离开这里。”这个黑人连忙回答说他过得很好，他想要登记是个错误。后来这个黑人虽留在原地，他的妻子却失掉了工作。
