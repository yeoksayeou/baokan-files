    “Words Suppressed for a Year”
    Jin Jin
    The debate meeting had already been going on for the third day. Although the rich middle peasant Huang Dafa had already admitted defeat, acknowledging that the capitalist road was a dead end, everyone was still scrambling to speak, using their own personal experiences to refute his erroneous argument that "the agricultural cooperative is not as good as individual farming." The cooperative's "five guarantees" household, Granny Zhou Qi, became increasingly angry as she spoke, pointing at Huang Dafa and saying, "If you want to destroy the agricultural cooperative, you're taking my life!"
    After Granny Zhou Qi finished speaking, the cooperative director asked, "Does anyone else want to speak?" He asked several times, but no one responded. He figured that almost all of the poor peasant cooperative members had spoken, and almost everything that needed to be said had been said. He was just about to announce a transition to debating another topic when Zhang Qingzhi, who had been silently smoking, suddenly stood up and shouted, "I have something to say!" His sudden outburst surprised almost everyone. Zhang Qingzhi was a new middle peasant who had always been keen on taking the capitalist road and had partnered with Huang Dafa in business. His joining the cooperative, like Huang Dafa's, was also very reluctant. When he joined, he even said in front of everyone, "I will never say that the agricultural cooperative has any advantages, not even when I die!" After joining, he didn't participate in any activities except for the work point assessment meetings, and just buried himself in earning work points all day long. The cooperative cadres had a major headache with him, always regarding him as a "category four member" – the most backward and stubborn member. He hadn't said a word at this debate meeting, and some cooperative cadres had even privately rejoiced: What luck, the old stubborn one didn't speak up, otherwise we would have to spend a lot of effort to get through his thick skull. Now that he was speaking, no one knew what he would say!
    "You poor peasants all say the agricultural cooperative is good, we middle peasants should also say something!" Zhang Qingzhi said as if he was arguing with someone, fuming with anger, "You middle peasants don't speak up, forcing me to embarrass myself! You should know that the words I want to say have been suppressed for a whole year! It's precisely because I was afraid of this embarrassment that I haven't said them."
    What embarrassment was Zhang Qingzhi afraid of? Everyone was very interested, so the meeting place was so quiet that even coughs were suppressed.
    "When I joined the cooperative, I swore that I would never say that the agricultural cooperative had any advantages, but now I can't hold it in anymore, I have to say: the agricultural cooperative also has advantages for us middle peasants! The capitalist road is a harmful trap!" Before he finished speaking, the meeting place became lively, and the cooperative cadres exchanged surprised glances, as if saying: What the heck is going on here!
    "Everyone has seen, my family of seven didn't have a single piece of land or a single plot before liberation. Every year we could only rent a little more than two mu of land to cultivate. We couldn't rent more even if we wanted to. Four or five laborers were helping others with odd jobs all year round. We couldn't get enough to eat, and we don't know how much thin watery gruel we drank!
    "The Communist Party came and I turned over a new leaf. I was allocated nine mu of land in the land reform. I worked hard and applied more fertilizer to get a bumper harvest, and changed from borrowing grain every year to having surplus grain.
    "Before, I was indeed blinded by capitalism and forgot my roots. Once I had surplus grain, I had more worries. I always tried to use it to get rich, wanting to lend grain at interest, wanting to do business.
    "At this time, Dafa came to entice me to do business, exaggerating wildly, saying that as long as you do two rounds of trading, you can earn dozens of yuan and come back to buy land and live off it. I believed him and sold seven or eight dan of grain to trade ducks. Who knew that when I traded them to Yingzhou, all the ducks were swindled away by others." Zhang Qingzhi turned to Huang Dafa: "Now I ask you, did you have a share in the duck swindle? Why did they only swindle mine and not yours when we were together?"
    Huang Dafa buried his head between his legs.
    Zhang Qingzhi continued in one breath: "The ducks were swindled away, and not a penny of the capital was left. I went home dejectedly, not daring to say it, afraid of being laughed at. The following spring, I had some money in hand again and I was tempted again. I lied and said I was buying lime and falsely borrowed a sum of money from the bank. I scraped together two hundred yuan and went to do business again. This time it was trading chickens. I had been cheated once, so I was careful and cautious. This time I wasn't swindled, but the merchants colluded to cut my price, causing me to lose money." He turned around again: "I've always wondered, why didn't they cut your Dafa's price?"
    "When I lost money, I was even more unwilling to accept it, like a gambler, losing and coming back again, time after time, but no matter what I couldn't beat the merchants. By the fifth time I traded, almost all the capital was lost.
    "The money I borrowed from the bank was due again, and there was no way out, so I had to sell land. But besides Huang Dafa, no one wanted to buy it, and Huang Dafa's heart was so black, only agreeing to help me repay the bank loan and then give me ten yuan, he wanted six mu of my land! Fortunately, the bank knew my situation and allowed me to repay in installments, so I didn't have to sell the land. If it weren't for that, I'm afraid I wouldn't have a single mu of land now.
    "To be honest, even then my heart wasn't dead. I always wanted to win back what I lost. I also thought: Dafa can make money, why can't I? I didn't even think, how is doing business our farming people's job? If I want to make money, someone else must lose money! And, to make money, you have to have a black heart like Dafa!
    "I wanted to borrow money to win back what I lost, but I couldn't borrow it, making me jump up and down in anxiety. Later, the cooperative expanded, and I wanted to join but was afraid of losing out. Old Gao from the work team also used my embarrassing story to promote the idea, saying that whoever wants to take the capitalist road should look at me, Zhang Qingzhi, as an example. I felt very ashamed, and in a fit of pique, I decided not to join the cooperative. Later, Old Gao threw a tantrum, saying, Zhang Qingzhi, you're so stubborn, I'm giving you three months to repay the bank loan, let's see if you still take the capitalist road!"
    Speaking here, Zhang Qingzhi smiled at the deputy district head Gao Jian, who was sitting at the table taking notes: "Old Gao, you call that coercion and command! Later, the county party committee criticized you for this, asking you to make a self-criticism. I felt really good in my heart. But now I say, Old Gao, your coercion and command was right. Without that tantrum of yours, I would be working as a long-term laborer for Huang Dafa now!"
    He then picked up the interrupted thread: "I didn't have money to repay the loan, so I had no choice but to join the cooperative, I wasn't willing. So at that time I said, you're forcing me to join the cooperative, even if I die, I won't say the cooperative has any advantages. After joining the cooperative, I didn't care about anything, just knowing how to grab work points. Whether you say I'm backward or stubborn, I didn't care.
    "But the cooperative really does have advantages, I saw them one by one in my eyes and remembered them in my heart, just not saying them out loud. Later, you all knew that when it came time for spring plowing and rice transplanting, three of the five laborers in our family fell ill, and were sick all the way until the summer harvest. If I hadn't joined the cooperative, most of my nine mu of land would have been abandoned. And, to be honest, if the cooperative hadn't lent us medical expenses, the bones of the three of us would be rattling by now.
    "To be honest, if it weren't for the agricultural cooperative's policy of more work, more pay, we would have starved to death even if we didn't die of illness. It's because of more work, more pay that the work points we accumulated before, plus the work points from the summer harvest, weren't much less than those of you who weren't sick, and we also increased our income. Now I've repaid the bank loan, and I even have a surplus!
    "I originally wanted to say the words that had been suppressed for a year, but I always couldn't let go of my face. To be honest, if you, Huang Dafa, weren't spouting nonsense here, I still wouldn't have said it today. Now I can't care about losing face or not, I have to say it, so that the poor peasant brothers also know that we middle peasants also love the agricultural cooperative!"
    Zhang Qingzhi waved his raised hand like shouting a slogan at the end. Everyone, poor peasants and middle peasants alike, applauded him warmly, proving that he hadn't lost face, the one who had lost face was Huang Dafa. Huang Dafa buried his head between his legs even lower, so low that it almost touched the ground.

    “闷了一年的话”
    晋进
    辩论会已经开到第三天了。虽然富裕中农黄大发已经认输，承认资本主义道路是走不通的死路，但是大家仍是抢着发言，用自己的亲身体会来驳他说的“农业社不如单干好”的错误论调。社里的五保户周七婆越说越气愤，她指着黄大发说：“你要搞垮农业社，就是要我的命！”
    周七婆讲完话之后，社主任问：“还有人要发言吗？”连问几声没人应，算了算几乎所有的贫农社员都讲过了，要讲的差不多全讲了，正想宣布转入辩论另一个题目。这时一直在闷着头抽烟的张庆志突然站起来大声喊：“我说！”他这一突如其来的发言，使几乎所有的人都吃了一惊。张庆志是新中农，一直热衷于走资本主义道路，曾和黄大发搭伴做过生意。他的入社和黄大发一样，也是很勉强的，入社时还当着大家的面说：“我到死也不会说农业社有什么优越性！”入社后除了评分会什么活动也不参加，整天只是埋头抢工分，社干部对他非常头疼，一向把他当作“四类社员”——最最落后顽固的社员看待。这次辩论会上他一直不吭声，有的社干部还私自庆幸：真运气，老顽固没有出声，否则又得费许多工夫去打通他那个铁脑瓜。现在他发言了，真不知他会说些什么！
    “你们贫农都说农业社好，我们中农也应该说说！”张庆志好像和什么人吵架，气冲冲地说，“你们这些中农都不开口，硬逼着我来丢丑！要知道我想要说的话，整整闷了一年了！正是因为怕丢这分丑才一直没有说。”
    张庆志怕丢什么丑呢？大家都很感兴趣，所以会场静得连咳嗽都压低了。
    “入社的时候我赌咒死也不说农业社有优越性，但我现在闷不住了，我要说：农业社对我们中农也有优越性！资本主义这条路是害人坑！”话未说完，会场都活跃起来，社干部之间互递惊讶的眼色，好像是说：真见鬼，这是怎么搞的呀！
    “大家都看见，我一家七口解放前田无一块地无一片，每年只租到两亩多田来耕，想多租些也租不到，四、五个劳动力年年帮人家打短工。饭吃不上，粥水不知陷了多少！
    “共产党来我才翻过身来，土改分了九亩田，我使力加工加肥得到丰收，由年年借谷吃变成有了余粮。
    “我以前的确被资本主义迷了心忘了本。有了余粮我心事就多了，总是想办法用它来发财，又想放谷花，又想做生意。
    “这时大发就来诱我去做生意，吹得天花乱坠，说只要做两转就捞得几十元，回来买田坐吃都可以了。我信了他的话，卖了七八担谷去贩鸭，谁知贩到营州鸭子全被别人骗走了。”张庆志转过身来对着黄大发：“现在我问你，骗鸭这件事你有没有分？为什么在一起只骗了我的不骗你的？”
    黄大发把头埋到两腿间。
    张庆志又一口气接着说下去：“鸭子被骗了，本钱一文不剩，垂头丧气回到家里也不敢讲出来，怕人家笑话。第二年春天，我手上又有了一些钱就又动了心，扯谎说买石灰骗借了银行一笔钱，凑够两百元又去做生意。这回是贩鸡。我上过一次当就小心谨慎了，这次没有被骗走，但商人串通了杀我的价，使我蚀了本。”他又转过身来：“我一直都奇怪，为什么他们就不杀你大发的价呢？”
    “蚀了本我更不服气，好像赌仔一样，输了再来，一回又一回，但无论如何都搞不过商人。贩到第五回，本差不多蚀光了。
    “借银行的那笔钱又到期了，没有办法，只好卖田，但除了黄大发没有人要买，而黄大发的心好黑啊，只答应帮我还银行借款后再给十元钱，就要我六亩田！好在银行知道了我的情况，准我缓期分期归还，才没有卖田。如果不是这样，恐怕我现在一亩田也没有了。
    “老实说，到那时我的心还不死，我总想扳回本来。我还想：大发能赚钱，我就不能赚了吗？我根本不想想，做生意怎么是我们种田人的本分？如果我要赚钱，就一定有另外的人蚀本！而且，要赚钱除非也有大发那样的黑心！
    “我想借钱去扳本借不到，急得我跳来跳去。后来社里扩社了，我想参加又怕吃亏。工作组的老高又拿我这件丑事来宣传，说谁要走资本主义就看看我张庆志这个榜样，我觉得很丢脸，一赌气就决定不入社。后来老高发了一顿脾气，说你张庆志这么顽固，限你三个月内归还银行借款，看你还走不走资本主义道路！”
    说到这里，张庆志笑着对坐在桌边记录的副区长高健说：“老高，你这叫强迫命令哪！后来县委因为这个批评你，要你检讨，我心里真是舒服极了。但是现在我说，老高你强迫命令算对了，没有你那一顿脾气，我现在就要给黄大发打长工了！”
    他又接起刚才打岔的话：“我没有钱还借款，就只有入社了，我是不自愿的。所以那时我说，你逼着我入社，我死了也不会说社有什么优越性。入了社我什么也不管，就是知道抢工分。说我落后也好，顽固也好，我一概不理。
    “但社的确是有优越性，我一件件看在眼里记在心里，就是嘴上不说。后来你们又都知道，要春耕插秧了，我们家五个劳动力病倒了三个，一直病到夏收，要是不入社，我那九亩田大半都要丢荒。而且，老实说如果没有社借给医药费，我们三个人现在骨头都打鼓了。
    “老实说，要不是农业社实行的多劳多得政策，我们虽然不病死也要饿死。就是因为多劳多得，我们家以前做下的工分加上夏收的工分，比你们没有病的人少不了几多，我们也增加了收入。现在我还了银行的借款，还有余！
    “我本来想把闷了一年的话说出来，但总是放不下脸。老实说，如果不是你黄大发在这里胡说八道，我今天还不会说，现在我顾不了丢脸不丢脸了，我要把话说出来，让贫农兄弟也知道我们中农也是爱农业社的！”
    张庆志说到最后就像喊口号一样挥动着高举的手。大家，贫农、中农都热烈鼓掌欢迎他，证明他没有丢脸，丢脸的只是黄大发。黄大发夹在两腿间的头埋得更低了，低得几乎触到地上。
