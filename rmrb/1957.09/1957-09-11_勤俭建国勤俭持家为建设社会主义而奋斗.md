(Continued from yesterday)

　　Now, whether in urban or rural areas, there are still some people who believe that in a socialist society, the means of production are owned by the public, and all difficulties can be solved by relying on the government and cooperatives. They say, "There's no worry about food or clothing, and the state and cooperatives can subsidize birth, old age, illness, and death." Therefore, they only care about improving their lives in the present, "cooking all the rice in one pot and burning all the firewood in one stove," without planning their family life or valuing family savings. When they encounter problems, they cry out for help and demand subsidies. This kind of thinking and practice is wrong. We must criticize and correct this erroneous idea of one-sidedly relying on the state and the collective, without striving to overcome difficulties through our own efforts. With the attitude of masters of our own destiny, we should use our own strength to solve our own family's difficulties. For example, as long as we are frugal and pay attention to savings, we can solve unexpected difficulties such as weddings, funerals, births, old age, illness, and death by relying on our own strength. If not, we can also adopt the method of mutual assistance from relatives and neighbors. This will not only increase family savings and overcome our own difficulties but also reduce the burden on the state and support the country's socialist construction.

　　There are also some people who love vanity, show off, compare food and clothing, eat and drink extravagantly, and waste, which are infected with the bourgeois and loafer lifestyle and are incompatible with the hardworking and thrifty style of the working people. We must be vigilant and oppose this decadent bourgeois style in our daily life and resolutely fight against the bad habits of laziness, gluttony, and extravagance. We must recognize that a prosperous and strong socialist country and a wealthy and happy family are built on diligence and thrift. We must strive to carry forward the fine traditions of diligence and thrift inherent in our working people, so that the new trend of managing homes diligently and frugally can be universally established in society.

　　A more beautiful future for the motherland is right in front of us. For this great goal, we must all mobilize, build the country diligently and frugally, manage our homes diligently and frugally, and contribute even greater strength to the cause of socialist construction.

　　(V) More firmly establish a new atmosphere of protecting marriage, family, mothers, and children

　　The Communist Party has always treated the issues of marriage, family, mothers, and children with lofty communist morality. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Party and the government have been closely concerned with these issues. As early as 1950, the Marriage Law was promulgated, and the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, promulgated in 1954, clearly stipulated the protection of marriage, family, mothers, and children. In recent years, thanks to the efforts of the Party and the government in publicity and implementation, the socialist moral thinking of the broad masses of the people has grown day by day, and a new atmosphere of protecting marriage, family, mothers, and children has also been established in society.

　　In terms of marriage, the feudal marriage system has been basically destroyed. After the broad masses of the people gained the right to marital autonomy, many people have been and are using socialist ideological principles to deal with their marriage problems. Their marriage relationships are no longer built on the amount of property or the status of family but on the basis of common labor, common construction of socialism, and mutual love; therefore, their marriages are happy and fulfilling.

　　However, because the bourgeois views on love and marriage are still influencing us, there are still a few people who establish marriage relationships either from the pursuit of pleasure, admiration of vanity, or greed for ease; or they handle marriage and divorce issues lightly, resulting in marital pain. In response to this situation, our Party, government, and people's organizations are strengthening marriage guidance work and continuing to advocate that young men and women build their marriage relationships on the basis of equality between men and women, ideological consistency, common labor, mutual respect, and mutual love. We firmly oppose those remnants of feudal arranged and forced marriages, and the evil habits of buying and selling marriages and early marriages; we constantly advocate that parents and elders no longer arrange marriages for their children. We constantly persuade young people to cherish their right to marital autonomy, especially to cherish their precious youth, establish a socialist career ambition, concentrate on studying politics, culture, and labor skills, and contribute greater strength to building socialism; it is appropriate to marry later and avoid the harm of early marriage.

　　It can be seen that the Party, government, and people's organizations have always been concerned about the people's marriage life and educating the people to treat marriage issues with socialist ideological principles; therefore, the marriage life of our broad masses of the people is basically healthy and fulfilling. We have been and are criticizing the bourgeois decadent views on marriage and love and the residual ideas of feudal marriage through various opportunities, and striving to eliminate the influence of this old thinking. However, the bourgeois rightists completely obliterated the efforts of the Party and the government and completely obliterated the fact that the socialist moral qualities of the broad masses of the people are growing day by day. They maliciously slandered that the relationship between the sexes is now "uncontrolled" and "has caused a lot of problems." They also attributed the painful marriages and erroneous marriage views left over from the exploiting classes to the leadership of the Communist Party. Their purpose is clearly to attempt to dominate the people's marriage life with the decadent views of bourgeois sociology.

　　In terms of family issues: Since liberation, especially after the victory of the people's democratic revolution and socialist transformation, many families that were scattered and broken up have reunited. Many single men and widows have rebuilt families, and many poor and suffering families have become increasingly wealthy and happy. New relationships between family members based on socialist ideological principles are growing day by day. The vast majority of families in our country are harmonious and united, and family members enjoy the joy of family life with happy hearts.

　　The atmosphere of respecting the old and loving the young is growing on a new basis in families and society. Many families, due to increased income and improved living conditions, have been able to better support their parents-in-law. Since the implementation of the labor insurance regulations in cities and the "five guarantees" in rural areas, many widowed and elderly people have been able to receive support in their old age and be buried after death. Children are cherished as the flowers of the motherland, and vast numbers of nurseries, kindergartens, and schools are educating children in all aspects, focusing on their physical and mental characteristics. Mothers, in implementing the "five goods," have paid more attention to the education of their children and improved their educational methods.

　　However, because a portion of our broad masses of people are still influenced by bourgeois and feudal ideas to varying degrees in handling family issues, there are still some children and daughters-in-law who dislike their parents-in-law and are unwilling to support them. There are also a few families where "only men are in charge, and women have no say." There are also a few parents who have adopted an irresponsible attitude towards their children and are not good at educating them in the right way. In response to these situations, our Party, government, and people's organizations have been and are continuing to advocate the establishment and improvement of family relationships based on socialist ideological principles, and advocate that the relationships between parents, children, husbands and wives, mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, and sisters-in-law should be based on respect for the old and love for the young, respect for mothers-in-law and love for daughters-in-law, mutual assistance, harmony, and democracy; they have been and are educating young people to recognize that respecting and supporting the elderly is the responsibility of children. Parents have worked hard day and night to raise their children, and when they lose their ability to work, their children are of course responsible for supporting them. The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China clearly stipulates that children have the obligation to support their parents. We must continue to advocate that parents earnestly and diligently raise and educate their children, and especially pay attention to conducting labor education and cultivating labor habits in their children, so that they can become socialist laborers with socialist consciousness, culture, and healthy bodies. All parents should pay special attention to improving their socialist moral qualities and views on the glory of labor, and influence and educate their children with their exemplary actions; actively cooperate with kindergartens, nurseries, schools, and other aspects, and educate them in all aspects, focusing on the physical and mental characteristics of children. Parents should neither dote on or beat their children, nor should they abuse the children of their ex-wives, ex-husbands, or others, because such practices will damage the children's physical and mental health. At present, there are still many bad elements in society who harm young children and induce them to engage in criminal activities. These bad people should be resolutely exposed and given severe legal sanctions.

　　We have been and are continuing to advocate the spirit of cooperating in running affairs with money and effort, relying on the strength of the people themselves, thinking of more ways, tapping potential, and developing mass women's and children's welfare undertakings. In cities, we should continue to promote diverse street nurseries and kindergartens; in rural areas, we should continue to develop diverse childcare organizations such as mutual assistance from relatives and neighbors, busy farming childcare groups, and busy farming nurseries and toddler teams. Throughout the country, including government agencies and enterprises, we should improve the operation and management of nurseries, improve the level of service, and lower the fees, based on the spirit of running nurseries diligently and frugally. The establishment of childcare organizations should generally focus on day care, supplemented by a small amount of full-time care; the latter should gradually become mainly for children whose parents have died, whose parents are chronically ill, who are away from home for a long time, or who have other special needs for full-time care. This approach can not only give full play to the role of existing childcare organizations and increase the number of children enrolled, but also benefit children and parents.

　　It can be seen that our Party, government, and people's organizations are concerned about the family life of the people and have been and are educating the people with socialist moral ideas to improve and establish new family relationships. A large number of harmonious and united families have been widely established, many elderly people are spending happy old ages, and many children are enjoying loving maternal care. In our country, we are gradually achieving "the old will be cared for, the strong will be employed, the young will be raised, and the widowed, orphaned, lonely, disabled, and sick will all be supported." Facts have proven that only the Chinese Communists have truly inherited and carried forward the fine moral tradition inherent in the Chinese people of "respecting the elderly as we respect our own, and loving the young as we love our own." Only in a socialist society can we proceed from the six hundred million people, take overall consideration, and gradually ensure that all men, women, old, and young in the country can find their proper place. The bourgeois rightists insist on obliterating the facts, saying that the family has become a "hotel" and that parents do not educate their children; they insist on saying that the "five guarantees" for caring for the elderly has become a bad thing that has led children and daughters-in-law not to support their parents; they insist that the new society is "unaffectionate"; this is obviously to oppose the socialist system from the family aspect.

　　In terms of family planning: Many of our women, especially mothers with many children, urgently demand to have children in a planned way. The Party and the government have given great concern and support to this demand of the women. Because too many children inevitably lead to overwork for mothers, affecting their work, production, study, and health, and making it difficult for children to receive good education; for the country, too rapid population growth is detrimental to the rapid development of socialist construction and the faster improvement of people's lives. Therefore, the purpose of our promoting family planning is to protect the health of women and children, to better raise and educate children, to make family life more beautiful and happy, and also to enable socialist construction to develop faster. We must continue to promote family planning throughout the country (except in ethnic minority areas), that is, to advocate that the people have children in a planned way according to their own wishes and conditions. Now that our country's production is planned, the production of human beings themselves should and can also be planned. To implement family planning, adhering to contraception is the most important method; artificial abortion is only used in unavoidable circumstances. To practice contraception, we can take various methods that are currently effective and harmless to the body. Do not take untested prescriptions indiscriminately, so as to avoid adverse consequences.

　　Our advocacy of family planning is fundamentally different from the viewpoints of the bourgeois rightists' so-called population theory. Many of the "sociologists" among the rightists were past peddlers of Malthusianism. They attempted to restore bourgeois sociology, and in the issue of population, they clamored wildly, one-sidedly exaggerating the difficulties of large population and small arable land; deliberately setting aside conditions such as the socialist system and the development of science and technology, isolating and looking at the problem from the development of the population, and shouting that a large population is a fatal injury and that food production cannot keep up. In reality, the rightists were smuggling in Malthus's fallacy that "the rate of population growth will always exceed the rate of food growth," deliberately exaggerating the difficulties in people's lives. We must smash this vicious anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist conspiracy.

　　Promoting family planning and firmly establishing a new atmosphere of protecting mothers and children are not contradictory. Some people discriminate against pregnant women and do not respect motherhood after promoting family planning, which is a misunderstanding. While promoting family planning, we must continue to widely publicize the importance of protecting mothers and children, and actively promote new methods of delivery and popularize maternal and child health knowledge and parenting knowledge, which is another important task to protect the health of women and children.

　　Marriage, family, and children issues are where the vital interests of women lie. We must resolutely fight back against the bourgeois rightists' conspiracy to restore bourgeois sociology and to drag our women back into the painful abyss of bourgeois marriage and family. Facts have proven that only in a socialist society, only in a socialist marriage family, can women be brought happiness and equality; only lofty communist morality can carry forward all the fine moral traditions in history; only the Chinese Communists have truly inherited the noble morality inherent in the Chinese working people and opposed the bourgeois feudal false morality. Therefore, our women must draw a clear line between themselves and the bourgeois rightists from political, ideological, moral, and even lifestyle aspects, and strive to eliminate the feudal residual ideas and bourgeois ideological influences in marriage, family, and children, and more firmly establish socialist moral ideas, so that protecting marriage, family, mothers, and children becomes everyone's conscious action.

　　(VI) Conscientiously improve and strengthen the work of women's federations

　　To build a prosperous and happy socialist country, we must rely on the people of the whole country and the women of the whole country to give full play to their high socialist enthusiasm and build the country diligently and frugally, and manage their homes diligently and frugally. The responsibility of our women's federation organizations lies in uniting and educating the women of the whole country to complete the above-mentioned glorious, arduous, and major tasks; to this end, the women's federation organizations must also conscientiously improve and strengthen women's work. The women's federation organizations above the county level must, in accordance with the instructions of the CPC Central Committee on the rectification movement, examine and overcome the bad work styles of bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism that are divorced from reality and the masses; realistically solve major problems in their work, conscientiously improve their leadership styles, and effectively improve their work. Now, let's talk about some issues in the work objects, work content, and leadership style of the women's federation organizations.

　　All women are the work objects of the women's federation organizations; at present, we should still focus on strengthening the work among family women in all strata of cities and rural women. To this end, we must especially strengthen the work of grassroots organizations in cities and rural areas. From the perspective of the methods used by the women's federations to carry out women's work, we must see that since a large number of women have participated in social labor and have been organized in various political, economic, cultural, and other organizations, even family women have established certain organizational ties with residents' committees and family committees; therefore, relying on relevant groups and units to carry out work among women is more important than ever before. At the same time, it is more urgent than ever before for our women's federation organizations to genuinely care about the women's work in relevant groups and units and effectively promote all aspects of doing women's work. The main responsibility of the women's federation lies in understanding the situation, studying problems, caring for and supporting the correct demands and reasonable opinions of women, and promoting and assisting relevant groups and units to appropriately solve the unique difficulties and problems of women. If we fail to see that all relevant parties can play a decisive role in carrying out women's work among the women's masses under their jurisdiction, and attempt to do a good job of women's work in all relevant parties directly by the women's federation, it will not work. If we rely solely on the relevant parties to carry out women's work without the cooperation and promotion of the women's federation organizations, it is also unrealistic. Only when the women's federation organizations cooperate with each other and work together with the relevant groups and units in accordance with the principle of mobilizing men and women together can women's work be done better.

　　At present, women's federation organizations should focus on carrying out the following three aspects of work among the women's masses:

　　First, we must regularly and systematically strengthen the political and ideological education of the women's masses. After the socialist revolution has achieved a decisive victory and after women have been liberated, the most important content of women's work is to strengthen the political and ideological education of the women's masses. In the past, although we had a preliminary understanding of this point and made achievements, it was not systematic enough and not in-depth enough. We must vigorously improve it in the future.

　　The purpose of carrying out political and ideological work among the women's masses is to constantly improve the socialist consciousness of the women's masses, resolutely oppose and overcome capitalist ideas, correct the political direction, consolidate the leadership of the Party, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, consolidate the socialist system, and develop socialist construction. The content of carrying out political and ideological work among the women's masses is: drawing a clear ideological line between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and firmly establishing the determination to take the socialist road; resolutely implementing the policy of building the country and managing homes diligently and frugally, and promoting the style of diligence and thrift; more widely establishing a new atmosphere of protecting marriage, family, mothers, and children, and overcoming the residual ideas of the old society's contempt for and discrimination against women.

　　At present, the women's federation organizations should especially, in accordance with the Party's policy of mobilizing men and women together, actively mobilize and support the women's masses to participate in the struggle against the bourgeois rightists, encourage women to actively participate in the great debate on the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and guide women to clarify the major issues of right and wrong in actual struggle, and unswervingly take the socialist road, so as to facilitate the greater role of women in building the country and managing homes diligently and frugally.

　　The women's federation organizations have a special responsibility for publicizing and implementing the policy of managing homes diligently and frugally. Chairman Mao Zedong instructed us: "In order to solve the problem of managing homes diligently and frugally, we must especially rely on women's organizations to do the work." In the past, our women's federation organizations universally promoted the "five goods" among family women in all strata of cities, and also tried to promote the "five goods" in a small number of rural areas (that is, diligence, love for the country, love for the society, unity and mutual assistance, managing the home diligently and frugally, studying culture and technology, respecting the mother-in-law, loving the daughter-in-law, educating children, and being clean and hygienic); in these work, we paid attention to publicizing managing the home diligently and frugally and achieved good results. However, because our women's federation organizations did not have a sufficient understanding of the great significance of managing the home diligently and frugally in the past, the publicity was not universal and in-depth enough. In the future, we must raise the publicity and education work on managing the home diligently and frugally for women to the most important position. Promoting the "five goods" is an effective method of conducting socialist political and ideological education for women, and the women's federation organizations should continue to widely adopt it.

　　Second, organize the strength of the masses themselves, promote mass mutual assistance and mutual benefit work, and develop mass women's and children's welfare undertakings. The Party and the government have always given great concern and support to women's and children's welfare undertakings; however, because the state's funds must be concentrated on economic construction, our women's federation, in order to assist the state in promoting women's and children's welfare undertakings, must implement the spirit of mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses, and cooperate with relevant people's organizations and government departments to further carry out mutual assistance and mutual benefit work among the families of employees and other family women, and organize the strength of the masses to develop women's and children's welfare undertakings.

　　In order to further promote mutual assistance and mutual benefit work, the women's federation organizations should regularly explain the socialist spirit of friendship and unity to the women's masses, and guide everyone to recognize that our women are all sisters in the socialist family, helping each other in difficulties, sharing what we have and don't have, and supporting each other in illness, which is a due friendship. Past experience has proven that organizing mutual labor assistance and economic assistance activities among the families of employees and promoting the development of mass childcare organizations and service undertakings in urban street women have achieved remarkable results; these works have played a good role in solving the difficulties of women themselves and in serving socialist construction, and have been deeply supported by the masses, and can be widely and universally promoted.

　　Third, on the basis of socialism, expand the united front of women's federation organizations and strengthen the great unity of women throughout the country. The women's federation organizations should further expand their contacts with women of all strata. Working women are the largest majority of women, and we must first strengthen and expand our contacts with them; and pay attention to promoting the unity between urban and rural working women. On this basis, we should further consolidate and expand the connection between working women and women from all strata, and we should always encourage and assist women in the industrial and commercial circles to continue to carry out ideological remolding, and encourage and assist them to play an active role in the cause of socialist construction. Women's federation organizations should continue to pay attention to uniting and guiding their group members, follow the instructions of the Party and the government and the resolutions of the women's federation organizations, and carry out work that is beneficial to socialism and beneficial to the women's masses.

　　In recent years, the vast number of women representatives at the grassroots level of the women's federation have played a great role in closely linking the women's federation with the women's masses and reflecting the opinions and demands of the women's masses; in assisting the government in implementing various policies and tasks, they have become powerful assistants to the grassroots regime. The All-China Women's Federation is satisfied with the achievements made by the women representatives in their work. In the future, the women's federation organizations at all levels should give them more help, care about their progress, and solve their difficulties in their work, so that they can better connect with the masses.

　　Women's federation organizations should further expand their contacts with returned overseas Chinese women and dependents of overseas Chinese, give play to their enthusiasm for loving the motherland, educate them to continuously improve their socialist consciousness, and encourage them to serve socialist construction in all aspects from their families and from the society. We should enthusiastically help them solve their living difficulties and demands, and we should patiently explain some problems that cannot be solved at present.

　　In order to do the above work well, the women's federation organizations must conscientiously improve their leadership style and work methods. First of all, we must continue to learn and use the working method of the mass line, which is the method of correctly handling contradictions among the people. In recent years, the women's federation organizations at all levels throughout the country have basically implemented the mass line in their work; however, some leading cadres have developed the bad habits of bureaucracy, and some women's federation organizations are not good at using the method of the mass line to carry out their work, and even have a coercive command style, which has led to good things being done badly and aroused the dissatisfaction of the masses. In the future, we should constantly check and correct these bad styles, strengthen the mass viewpoint, summarize and promote the experience of following the mass line, so as to educate cadres, improve work, and reduce or avoid errors and problems in work.

　　To achieve this, the key issue is that the main leading cadres set an example, go deep into the key points, go deep into the women's masses, share weal and woe with the masses, and have more contact and talk more with the masses, so as to understand their thoughts, feelings, and demands. For important issues in the work, we should conduct typical investigations in a planned way, so that we can draw correct opinions and guide the work in a timely manner after research and analysis. The women's federation organizations should stipulate this method as a regular working system. The method of "going deep into key points, accumulating experience, and guiding work" that we have advocated in the past is a method of using the mass line. Experience has proven that work can achieve remarkable results wherever this method is well used. Therefore, we should adhere to and promote this method.

　　Secondly, our women's federation organizations must conduct women's work under the unified leadership of the Party, closely combined with the relevant work of the Party and the government and the central work of each period. This is not only because we must first mobilize women to participate in the overall work and the central movement in order to facilitate the solution of women's special problems, but also because only when the women's federation cadres actively participate in the overall work and the central movement can they understand the overall situation and see the whole, which is conducive to doing a good job of women's work. Therefore, in carrying out work among women of any class or profession, we must combine it with the relevant overall work. In carrying out the work of female employees and families of employees, we must combine it with the work of trade unions and the administrative work of government agencies and enterprises; in carrying out the work of rural women, we must combine it with the work of agricultural production cooperatives; this has been proven by our experience over the years. Therefore, the women's federation organizations must continue to educate women cadres, take the initiative to actively participate in the various tasks and central work that the Party needs us to do, and participate in various related activities, so as to understand the relevant women's problems and carry out women's work from these work and activities. It is wrong to regard participating in these work as "doing chores," and this view should be corrected. At the same time, when the women's federation organizations participate in the relevant tasks and central work, they must have their own work plans, so as to consciously do a good job of women's work through these work; otherwise, women's work cannot be done well.

　　Finally, our women's federation organizations must give better play to the role of collective leadership and further expand the democratic life within the women's federation organizations. The women's federation organizations are extensive united front organizations. The executive committees of the women's federation at all levels, the presidium of the All-China Women's Federation, and the standing committees of the local women's federation are the collective leading bodies of the women's federation, and should hold regular and prepared meetings in accordance with the regulations, and fully discuss major issues in the women's federation's work, so as to give full play to the role of collective leadership and overcome the problems of formalism. The women's congresses at all levels should be held on schedule, and fully discuss women's issues and women's work, and give full play to the role of women's masses in criticizing and supervising the women's federation organizations. At present, sectarianism and insufficient democratic life exist to varying degrees in the leading organizations of the women's federations at all levels, and we should strive to overcome them in the future.

　　We are deeply convinced that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, under the supervision of the National Women's Congress and the women of the whole country, the women's federation organizations at all levels will certainly improve their leadership style, improve their work methods, and further strengthen women's work. Doing a good job of women's work makes a great contribution to socialism. The women's federation organizations must exist for a long time and be good at giving play to the role of the organization. The women's federation cadres must be determined to serve the women's masses for a long time and make greater achievements in their work. Most of the representatives attending the meeting today are women representatives from various production positions, work positions, and families, and have certain connections with the women's masses; we are deeply convinced that when you return to your own positions or families, you will certainly assist and supervise the women's federation organizations, and promote your respective organizations and departments to carry out women's work under the leadership of the Party, with division of labor and cooperation, mobilize and unite the broad masses of women, build the country diligently and frugally, manage their homes diligently and frugally, and make greater contributions to building a socialist motherland and to a better future for women and children. Dear representatives! The women's masses have given us the glorious title of women's representatives. In order to answer well the trust of the women's masses in us, I think everyone will try their best to serve the women's masses in all aspects and use various opportunities in accordance with the resolutions of this conference.

　　(VII) Enhance the friendship and unity with women from all countries in the world

　　Now, I want to talk about the tasks of our women in China and our women's federation organizations in strengthening the friendship and unity with women from all countries in the world and jointly safeguarding world peace.

　　Defending peace, defending women's rights, and protecting children are the ardent wishes of our women and mothers throughout the country, and this wish is linked to the hearts of women and mothers all over the world. For this kind wish, and according to the peaceful diplomatic policy of our government, our women's federation organizations have represented the women of the whole country and made great efforts to develop and consolidate the unity with the women of the Soviet Union and socialist countries, and enhance the mutual understanding and friendship with peace-loving women from Asian, African countries, and all countries in the world. The friendly exchanges between Chinese women and women from all countries have been increasing day by day. In the recent four years, the All-China Women's Federation has received a total of 458 foreign guests from 60 countries, and sent 121 representatives of Chinese women themselves to 13 countries for friendly visits. In this kind of mutual visits and contacts, Chinese women have enhanced mutual understanding and friendship with women from all countries, and at the same time, we have learned a lot of useful knowledge.

　　Since its establishment, the Women's International Democratic Federation has made great contributions in uniting and mobilizing women around the world to defend peace, defend women's rights, and protect children. Chinese women have always actively supported and participated in the international women's peace movement. For more than four years, we have sent 145 representatives to participate in 16 international women's gatherings of different scales and different natures. We warmly responded to and fully supported the just calls of the Women's International Democratic Federation for universal disarmament, complete prohibition of atomic and thermonuclear weapons, and immediate cessation of hydrogen bomb tests.

　　Now, the Western aggressive groups headed by American imperialism are still constantly creating international tension, deliberately obstructing disarmament agreements, pursuing policies of aggressive war, and occupying Taiwan, our sacred territory. To defend world peace, to oppose aggression, and to defend the rights of women and children, we must further consolidate and strengthen the close unity between Chinese women and women from socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. The strength and unity of socialist countries are the most favorable conditions for our country to carry out socialist construction, and the most reliable guarantee for defending world peace and developing the cause of human progress. And the assistance and support of the great Soviet Union and other fraternal countries to our country are important conditions for our socialist construction cause to achieve rapid development. The bourgeois rightists viciously attacked our great ally, the Soviet Union, and attacked our government's one-sided foreign policy. Their absurd remarks are completely contrary to the interests and wishes of our people and have been unanimously condemned and discarded by the people and women of our country. The great Soviet people are always our people's best friends and brilliant examples. We must continue to unswervingly develop and consolidate the close unity and cooperation with Soviet women, and develop and consolidate the close unity and cooperation with women from other socialist countries. This rock-solid unity of our socialist countries' women is eternal and unbreakable.

　　We must continue to strengthen the friendship and unity with women from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. We Chinese women have long been subjected to imperialist oppression and enslavement. We share many common experiences, situations, and wishes with women from Asian and African countries and Latin American countries who have been liberated from colonial rule or are fighting for liberation. Therefore, we cherish the friendship and unity between us very much. At the same time, we must strengthen and expand our unity with women from all countries in the world in the struggle to defend peace, defend the rights of women and children, enhance mutual understanding and friendship, and learn useful knowledge from women from all countries.

　　We see that in our era, women are forming a powerful force for defending world peace. Not only are women who have been liberated in socialist countries a powerful force for defending world peace, but also the vast number of women in all countries around the world who have suffered from the disasters of the two world wars are increasingly waking up and actively fighting to defend peace, defend women's rights, and protect children. We are deeply convinced that as long as peace-loving women from all countries in the world unite together with the people of the world, we can defend world lasting peace, create a peaceful and tranquil environment for women and children, and the rights of women and the happiness of children can be effectively guaranteed.

　　Dear representatives! Now our women, together with the people of the whole country, are carrying out a great socialist revolution in politics and ideology and building a great socialist country under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. The Communist Party of China is the helmsman leading the Chinese people continuously from victory to victory, and the lighthouse illuminating the way forward for the people of the whole country. As long as our women unswervingly follow the Communist Party of China and take the socialist road, thoroughly defeat the bourgeois rightists; as long as we continue to give play to the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle in the past, continue to carry forward the fine tradition of diligence and thrift, and contribute all our women's intelligence and talents to the country with great spirit, strong will, building the country diligently and frugally, managing their homes diligently and frugally; then our women will surely be able to build a prosperous and happy socialist society together with the people of the whole country, and women and children will surely be able to live an increasingly better life. As long as the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union are united, as long as the peace-loving people and women all over the world are united, we can defend world peace, defend the rights of women and children; we can build a socialist motherland in a peaceful international environment. Dear sisters all over China! Dear representatives! Let us move towards such a great goal!

　　勤俭建国勤俭持家为建设社会主义而奋斗
　　——1957年9月9日章蕴同志在中国妇女第三次全国代表大会上的报告——
　　（续昨）
    现在不论城乡，都还有一些人认为在社会主义社会，生产资料归了公，一切困难都可以依赖政府，依赖合作社来解决。她们说，不愁吃，不愁穿，生、老、病、死都可以要求国家和合作社补助。因此，她们只顾眼前改善生活，“有米一锅煮，有柴一灶烧”，不计划家庭生活，不重视家庭积蓄，遇到有事，就叫喊困难，要求补助，这种想法和做法是不对的。我们必须批判和纠正这种片面地依赖国家、集体，而不努力地依靠自己的力量来克服困难的错误思想，以主人翁的态度，用自己的力量来解决自己家庭的困难。比如，只要平时省吃俭用，注意积蓄，遇到婚丧喜庆，生老病死的意外困难，依靠自己的力量是可以解决的；再不然，也可以采取亲邻相帮、互助互济的办法来解决。这样既增加家庭储蓄，克服自己的困难，又可以减少国家负担，支持了国家的社会主义建设事业。
    现在还有些人爱虚荣，讲排场，比吃比穿，大吃大喝，铺张浪费，是沾染了资产阶级的、二流子的生活作风，同劳动人民的勤劳俭朴的作风是不相容的。我们必须在日常生活中，随时警惕和反对这种资产阶级的腐朽作风，坚决地同好吃懒做、铺张浪费的恶劣风气作斗争。我们要认识，繁荣富强的社会主义和富裕幸福的家庭是靠勤劳节俭建立起来的。要努力发扬我国劳动人民固有的勤劳节俭的优良传统，使勤俭持家的新风气在社会上普遍地树立起来。
    祖国更美好的将来，正摆在我们面前。为着这个伟大的目标，我们大家都要动员起来，勤俭建国，勤俭持家，在社会主义建设事业中贡献更大的力量。
    （五）更巩固地树立保护婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童的新风气
    共产党一贯是用崇高的共产主义道德思想，对待婚姻、家庭、母亲、儿童的问题。中华人民共和国成立之后，党和政府密切关怀这方面的问题。早在1950年就颁布了婚姻法，1954年颁布的中华人民共和国宪法，又明确规定了保护婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童。几年来，由于党和政府的努力宣传和贯彻执行，广大人民的社会主义道德思想日益成长，社会上保护婚姻、家庭、母亲、儿童的新风气也树立起来了。
    在婚姻方面，封建婚姻制度已经基本摧毁，广大人民群众获得婚姻自主权利之后，许多人已经并正在运用社会主义思想原则，来处理自己的婚姻问题。他们的婚姻关系再不是建筑在财产的多少、门第的高低，而是建筑在男女共同劳动、共同建设社会主义及相互爱慕的基础之上；所以他们的婚姻是美满和幸福的。
    但是，由于资产阶级的恋爱、婚姻观点还在影响着我们，现在还有少数人或者从追求享乐、爱慕虚荣、贪图安逸出发，来建立婚姻关系；或者轻率地处理结婚离婚问题，以致造成婚姻痛苦。针对这种情况，我们党、政府、人民团体正在加强婚姻指导工作，继续提倡青年男女把婚姻关系建筑在男女平等、思想一致、共同劳动、互敬互爱的基础上。对于那些残存的封建的包办强迫、买卖婚姻和早婚恶习，我们是坚决反对的；我们不断提倡作父母长辈的人，再不要包办儿女的婚姻。我们不断说服青年人要珍爱自己已经获得的婚姻自主权利，尤其要善于爱惜宝贵的青年时代，树立社会主义的事业心，集中精力学习政治，学习文化，学好劳动的本领，为建设社会主义贡献更大的力量；适当地晚一些结婚，避免早婚的害处。
    由此可见，党、政府、人民团体是一贯关怀人民的婚姻生活，教育人民用社会主义思想原则对待婚姻问题；因此我们广大人民的婚姻生活基本上是健康的美满的。对于资产阶级腐朽的婚姻恋爱观点，对于封建婚姻的残余思想，我们已经并正在通过各种机会进行批判，努力清除这种旧的思想影响。但是资产阶级右派分子完全抹煞了党和政府的努力，完全抹煞了广大人民的社会主义道德品质日益成长的事实。他们恶毒地诽谤说：现在两性关系“没人管”“弄得问题一大堆”。他们把剥削阶级遗留下来的痛苦婚姻和错误的婚姻观点，也归罪于共产党的领导。其目的显然是企图用资产阶级社会学的腐朽观点来支配人民的婚姻生活。
    在家庭问题方面：解放以来，特别在人民民主革命和社会主义改造取得胜利之后，许多妻离子散的家庭重新团聚了。许多单身汉和寡妇新建了家庭，许多贫穷痛苦的家庭日益富裕和幸福。家庭成员之间基于社会主义思想原则建立起来的新关系，日益成长。我国绝大多数家庭是和睦团结的，家庭成员都以愉快的心情，享受着天伦的乐趣。
    在家庭里、社会上，尊老爱幼的风气正在新的基础上日益成长。许多家庭由于收入的增加，生活的改善，青年人有可能较好地扶养自己的父母公婆。从城市推行劳动保险条例、农村推行“五保”之后，许多鳏寡老人得以老有所养，死有所葬。儿童被珍视为祖国的花朵，广大的托儿所、幼儿园及学校，正在针对儿童的身心特点，从各方面教育儿童。母亲们在执行“五好”中更加注意了对子女的教育，改善了教育方法。
    但是，由于我们广大人民中，现在还有一部分人在处理家庭问题方面，不同程度地还受着资产阶级的、封建的思想影响。因而还有某些作子女儿媳的嫌弃父母公婆，不愿供养。还有少数家庭“只有男人当家，没有女人主事”。也还有少数父母对子女采取了不负责任的态度，不善于用正确的方法来教育子女。针对这种种情况，我们的党、政府和人民团体，已经并正在继续提倡以社会主义思想原则来建立和改善家庭关系，提倡父母、子女、夫妻、婆媳、妯娌的关系，应该建立在尊老爱幼、尊婆爱媳、互相帮助、和睦民主的关系上；已经并正在教育青年人要认识尊敬老人、扶养老人是子女应尽的责任，父母为了抚育子女，曾经日日夜夜地辛勤劳动，当他们丧失劳动力的时候，子女当然有责任扶养。中华人民共和国婚姻法明文规定子女有扶养父母的义务。我们要继续提倡作父母的要认真努力地抚养和教育子女，特别要注意对子女进行劳动教育，培养劳动习惯，使子女能成为有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的、身体健康的社会主义劳动者。凡是作父母的，特别要注意提高自己社会主义的道德品质和劳动光荣的观点，以自己的模范行动来影响和教育孩子；主动和幼儿园、托儿所、学校等方面配合，针对儿童身心的特点，从各方面进行教育。作父母的既不应当溺爱或者打骂自己的子女，也不应当虐待前妻、前夫或他人的子女，因为这种作法，都会损伤孩子的身心健康。目前，社会上还有许多坏分子侵害少年儿童，引诱少年儿童进行犯罪活动，对这些坏人应当坚决地揭发出来，给予严厉的法律制裁。
    我们已经并正在继续提倡有钱出钱，有力出力的合作办事的精神，依靠人民群众自己的力量，多想办法，发掘潜力，发展群众性的妇女儿童福利事业。在城市应当继续推广多种多样的街道托儿站，幼儿园；在农村应当继续发展亲邻相帮、农忙托儿小组和农忙托儿所、幼儿队等多种多样的托儿组织。在全国，包括机关和企业在内，应根据勤俭办所的精神，改善托儿所的经营管理，提高业务水平，降低收费标准。举办托儿组织，一般以日托为主，辅之以少量的全托；后者要逐步变成主要只是收托父母死亡、父母长期有病、长期外出或有其他特殊需要全托的孩子。以上这种做法不仅能使现有托儿组织充分发挥作用，增收儿童而且对子女、父母都是有益的。
    由此可见，我们党、政府、人民团体是如何关怀着人民群众的家庭生活，已经并正在用社会主义道德思想来教育人民，改善和建立新的家庭关系。大量的和睦团结的家庭已经普遍建立起来了，许多老人正在过着愉快的晚年，许多儿童正在享受着慈祥的母爱。在我们国家正在逐步做到“老有所终，壮有所用，幼有所长，鳏、寡、孤、独、废疾者皆有所养。”事实证明只有中国共产党人，才真正承继和发扬了中国人民固有的“老吾老以及人之老，幼吾幼以及人之幼”的优良道德传统。也只有在社会主义社会，才能从六亿人口出发，统筹兼顾，逐步做到使全国男女老少，各得其所。资产阶级右派分子硬要抹煞事实，说什么家庭变成了“旅馆”，父母不教育子女；硬把照顾老人的“五保”说成了引起子女儿媳不赡养父母的坏事；硬说新社会是“六亲不认”；这显然是为了从家庭方面反对社会主义制度。
    在计划生育方面：我们许多妇女，特别是多子女的母亲，迫切要求有计划地生育子女。对妇女群众这种要求，党和政府已经给予极大的关怀和支持。因为子女过多，对母亲来说，势必操劳过度，影响工作、生产、学习和身体，而且使子女得不到很好的教育；对国家来说，人口增加太快，对社会主义建设的迅速发展和人民生活更快地改善，都是不利的。所以我们提倡计划生育的目的，是为了保护妇女儿童的健康，为了更好地教养子女，为了家庭生活过得更美好幸福，同时也是为了使社会主义建设能更快地发展。我们要在全国范围以内（少数民族地区除外）继续提倡计划生育，这就是提倡人民群众根据自己的愿望、自己的条件，有计划地生育。现在我们国家的生产计划化了，人类本身的生产也应该而且可以实行计划化的。要实行计划生育，坚持避孕是最主要的办法；只有在不得已的情况下，才采用人工流产。实行避孕可以采取当前行之有效而又对身体无害的各种办法，不要乱服未经鉴定的偏方，以免造成不良的后果。
    我们提倡计划生育同资产阶级右派分子所谓人口论的观点有着根本的区别。右派分子中的“社会学家”，有不少人过去就是马尔萨斯主义的贩卖者。他们企图使资产阶级的社会学复辟，在人口问题方面，大肆叫嚣，片面夸大人口多、耕地少的困难；故意撇开社会主义制度和科学技术发展等条件，孤立地从人口发展看问题，大叫人口多是致命伤，粮食生产赶不上。实际上，右派分子是在偷运马尔萨斯“人口增长的速度永远超过食物增长的速度”的谬论，有意扩大人民生活中的困难，这种恶毒的反党反人民反社会主义的阴谋，我们一定要粉碎它。
    提倡计划生育和巩固地树立保护母亲和儿童的新风气并不是矛盾的。有人在宣传计划生育之后，歧视孕妇，不尊重母性，这是一种误解。我们要与提倡计划生育的同时，继续广泛宣传保护母亲和儿童的重要，积极推动新法接生，普及妇婴卫生知识和育儿知识，这是保护妇女儿童健康的另一项重要工作。
    婚姻、家庭、儿童问题，是妇女切身利益所在。我们一定要坚决反击资产阶级右派妄想恢复资产阶级社会学，妄想把我们妇女重新拉回到资产阶级的婚姻家庭的痛苦的深渊中的阴谋。事实证明，只有在社会主义社会里，只有社会主义的婚姻家庭，才能带给妇女幸福与平等；只有崇高的共产主义道德，才能发扬历史上一切优良的道德传统；只有中国共产党人，才真正承继了中国劳动人民所固有的高尚的道德，反对资产阶级的封建的伪道德。因此，我们妇女必须从政治、思想、道德、以致生活作风等方面，与资产阶级右派划清界线，努力清除在婚姻、家庭、儿童方面的封建残余思想和资产阶级思想影响，更加巩固地树立社会主义的道德思想，使保护婚姻、家庭、母亲、儿童，成为人人自觉的行动。
    （六）认真改进和加强妇联组织的工作
    要建成繁荣幸福的社会主义国家，必须依靠全国人民和全国妇女发挥高度的社会主义积极性，勤俭建国，勤俭持家。我们妇联组织的责任，就在于团结教育全国妇女，完成上述光荣的艰巨的重大的任务；为此，妇联组织还必须认真改进和加强妇女工作。县级以上的妇联组织，要根据中共中央关于整风运动的指示，检查和克服工作中脱离实际、脱离群众的官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义的不良作风；实事求是地解决工作中的重大问题，认真改进领导作风，切实改进工作。现在，谈一谈妇联组织在工作对象、工作内容、领导作风等方面的一些问题。
    全体妇女都是妇联组织的工作对象；在当前仍然应该着重加强在城市的各阶层家庭妇女和农村妇女方面的工作，为此，必须特别加强城市和农村基层组织的工作，从妇联进行妇女工作的方法来说，我们必须看到。由于大量妇女参加了社会劳动，已经分别组织在各种政治、经济、文化等组织中，就是家庭妇女也已和居民委员会、家属委员会建立了一定的组织联系；因此依靠各有关团体、有关单位在妇女中进行工作，比过去任何时候更为重要了。同时，我们妇联组织，切实关怀各有关团体、单位中的妇女工作，并有效地推动各方面做妇女工作，也比过去任何时候更加迫切了。妇联的主要责任就在于了解情况，研究问题，关怀支持妇女的正确要求和合理意见，推动和协助有关团体、单位适当地解决妇女特有的困难和问题。如果看不到各有关方面在所属妇女群众中进行妇女工作，能起着决定性的作用，而企图由妇联直接去做好各有关方面的妇女工作，是行不通的。如果单纯依靠各有关方面进行妇女工作，而妇联组织不加配合、推动，也是不现实的。妇联组织只有根据男女一齐发动的方针，和各有关团体、单位相互配合，协同工作，才能把妇女工作做得更好。
    当前妇联组织，应着重在妇女群众中进行下列三方面的工作：
    第一、经常地有系统地加强对妇女群众的政治思想教育工作。在社会主义革命取得了决定性的胜利、在妇女已经获得解放之后，妇女工作最主要的内容，是加强对妇女群众的政治思想教育。过去我们对这一点虽然有初步认识，也作出了成绩，但不够系统，不够深入，今后必须大力改进。
    在妇女群众中进行政治思想工作的目的是：不断提高妇女群众的社会主义觉悟，坚决反对和克服资本主义思想，端正政治方向，巩固党的领导，巩固人民民主专政，巩固社会主义制度，发展社会主义建设。在妇女群众中进行政治思想工作的内容是：划清社会主义和资本主义两条道路的思想界线，巩固地树立走社会主义道路的决心；坚决地执行勤俭建国、勤俭持家的方针，发扬勤劳节俭的作风；更加广泛地树立保护婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童的新风气，克服旧社会遗留下来的轻视、歧视妇女的残余思想。
    目前妇联组织特别应该根据党的男女一齐发动的方针，积极发动和支持妇女群众参加反对资产阶级右派的斗争，鼓励妇女踊跃参加有关社会主义同资本主义的两条道路的大辩论，引导妇女们在实际斗争中，弄清大是大非，坚定不移地走社会主义道路，以便有利于更大地发挥妇女们对勤俭建国、勤俭持家的作用。
    对于宣传贯彻执行勤俭持家的方针，妇联组织有特殊的责任。毛泽东主席指示我们：“为了解决勤俭持家问题，特别要依靠妇女团体做工作。”过去我们妇联组织在城市各阶层家庭妇女中曾普遍推行了“五好”，在少数农村也曾试行推广了“五好”（即勤劳爱国爱社团结互助好，勤俭持家好，学习文化技术好，尊婆爱媳教育子女好，清洁卫生好）；在这些工作中都注意宣传了勤俭持家，收到了良好的效果。但是由于我们妇联组织过去对勤俭持家的重大意义认识不足，因此宣传还不够普遍和深入，今后必须把向妇女进行勤俭持家的宣传教育工作提到头等重要的地位上。推行“五好”是对妇女进行社会主义政治思想教育工作的有效的方法，妇联组织应当继续广泛采用。
    第二、组织群众自己的力量，推广群众互助互济工作，发展群众性的妇女儿童的福利事业。党和政府对于妇女儿童福利事业，一贯给予很大的关怀和支持；但由于国家的资金要集中到经济建设方面，我们妇联为协助国家推进妇女儿童福利事业，必须贯彻发动群众又依靠群众的精神，和有关人民团体、政府部门相互配合，在职工家属和其他的家庭妇女中进一步开展互助互济工作，并且组织群众力量来发展妇女儿童福利事业。
    为了进一步推广互助互济工作，妇联组织应当经常地向妇女群众阐述社会主义的友爱团结精神，引导大家认识我们妇女都是社会主义大家庭中的姊妹，困难相助，有无相通，疾病相扶持，是应有的友谊。过去的经验证明，在职工家属中组织劳力互助、经济互助的活动，在城市街道妇女中提倡发展群众性托儿组织和服务事业，已经收到显著的成效；这些工作对于解决妇女自身困难，对于为社会主义建设服务方面，都起了良好的作用，深受群众支持，可以大量地普遍地推广。
    第三、在社会主义的基础上，扩大妇联组织的团结面，加强全国妇女的大团结。妇联组织应该更加扩大同各阶层妇女的联系。劳动妇女是妇女中的最大多数，我们首先要加强和扩大同她们的联系；并注意促进城乡劳动妇女之间的团结。在这个基础上，进一步巩固扩大劳动妇女同各阶层妇女之间的联系，要注意经常鼓励和帮助工商界妇女继续进行思想改造，鼓励和帮助她们在社会主义建设事业中发挥积极的作用。妇联组织对于自己的团体会员，应当继续注意团结和引导她们，遵循党、政府的指示和妇联组织的决议，进行有益于社会主义、有益于妇女群众的工作。
    几年来，广大的妇联基层妇女代表，在密切妇联同妇女群众的联系、反映妇女群众的意见和要求中起了很大作用；在协助政府执行各项政策和任务中，成为基层政权的得力的助手。全国妇联对妇女代表们在工作中做出的成绩是满意的。今后妇联各级组织应当对她们给予更多的帮助，关怀她们的进步，解决她们在工作中的困难，使她们更好地联系群众。
    妇联组织要进一步扩大同各少数民族妇女的联系。几年来，这方面的工作是有成绩的，各民族妇女之间已经建立起了亲姐妹般的友谊。妇联组织今后应当根据各民族的特点和当时当地的中心工作，在少数民族妇女群众中广泛地开展工作，帮助少数民族妇女提高社会主义和爱国主义的觉悟。广泛地深入地宣传党的民族政策，加强民族团结教育，鼓励和帮助少数民族妇女互相学习、加强团结，反对大汉族主义及地方民族主义的错误思想。注意培养少数民族的女干部，鼓励和帮助她们努力学习，提高自己的政治觉悟和工作能力，遵守本民族的风俗习惯，密切联系本民族妇女，搞好家庭关系，以利工作。在少数民族地区工作的汉族妇女干部，应该善于尊重当地民族干部的职权和意见，善于和她们协商办事，相互学习；尊重她们的宗教信仰和风俗习惯，密切联系少数民族妇女；全心全意的为少数民族服务。
    妇联组织要加强同归国华侨妇女和华侨眷属的联系，发挥她们爱护祖国的热情，教育她们不断提高社会主义觉悟，鼓励她们从家庭里从社会上各方面，为社会主义建设服务。对于她们的生活困难和要求，应该热忱地帮助解决，对有些目前不能解决的问题也应当耐心地加以解释。
      妇联组织要做好上述工作，必须认真改进领导作风和工作方法。首先要继续学习和运用群众路线的工作方法，这是正确地处理人民内部矛盾的方法。几年来全国各级妇联组织在自己工作中基本上是执行了群众路线的；但是，有些领导干部滋长了官僚主义习气，有些妇联组织还不善于运用群众路线的方法来进行工作，甚至有强迫命令的作风，以致把好事办坏，引起了群众的不满。今后应当不断地检查和纠正这些不良的作风，加强群众观点，总结和推广走群众路线的经验，以便教育干部，改进工作，减少或避免工作中的错误和毛病。
    要做到这一点，关键问题在于主要领导干部以身作则，深入重点，深入到妇女群众中间去，和群众同甘共苦，和群众多来往多谈心，从而了解她们的思想感情和要求。对于工作中的重要问题，要有计划地进行典型调查，以便经过研究分析，得出正确意见，及时指导工作。妇联组织应当把这种方法，规定为一种经常的工作制度。我们过去提倡过的“重点深入，积累经验，指导工作”的方法，就是运用群众路线的一种方法。经验证明，凡是很好地运用了这种方法的地方，工作就能获得显著的成绩。因此，我们应该坚持推广这个方法。
    其次，我们妇联组织进行妇女工作必须在党的统一领导下，紧紧地同党和政府的有关各项工作以及各个时期的中心工作结合在一起。这不仅是因为必须首先发动妇女参加全面工作和中心运动，才能有利于解决妇女特有问题，而且妇联干部只有积极参加全面工作和中心运动，才能够了解全面，看到整体，有利于做好妇女工作。为此，在任何一个阶层或一种职业的妇女中进行工作，都必须与有关的整个工作相结合。在进行女职工和职工家属工作时，必须与工会工作，机关、企业的行政工作相结合；在进行农村妇女工作时，必须与农业生产合作社的工作相结合；这是我们多年来的经验所证明的。因此妇联组织要继续教育妇女干部，主动积极地参加党所需要我们去做的各项工作和中心工作，参加有关的各种活动，从这些工作和活动中了解有关的妇女问题，进行妇女工作。如果把参加这些工作认为是“打杂”，那是错误的，这种看法应予以纠正。同时，妇联组织在参加有关各项工作和中心工作时，又必须有自己的工作计划，以便通过这些工作，有意识地做好妇女工作；否则妇女工作同样是不能做好的。
    最后，我们妇联组织要更好地发挥集体领导的作用，进一步扩大妇联组织内部的民主生活。妇联组织是广泛的统一战线组织，各级妇联的执行委员会、全国妇联的主席团、地方妇联的常务委员会，是妇联的集体领导机构，应当按照章程，定期地有准备地举行会议，充分讨论有关妇联工作中的重大问题，以便充分地发挥集体领导作用，克服形式主义的毛病。各级妇女代表大会应当按期召开，充分讨论妇女问题和妇女工作，充分发挥妇女群众对妇联组织的批评和监督的作用。现在全国各级妇联领导组织中，都不同程度地存在着宗派主义情绪和民主生活不足的毛病，今后应当努力克服。
    我们深信各级妇联组织在中国共产党的领导下，在全国妇女代表大会和全国妇女的监督下，一定能改进领导作风，改进工作方法，进一步加强妇女工作。做好妇女工作对社会主义贡献是很大的，妇联组织必须长期存在并善于发挥组织的作用，妇联干部必须下决心长期为妇女群众服务，在工作中做出更大的成就。现在到会的绝大多数代表都是各种生产岗位上、工作岗位上及家庭里的妇女代表人物，和妇女群众都有一定联系；我们深信在你们回到自己岗位上或家庭里的时候，一定会协助和监督妇联组织，并推动各自的组织和各自的部门，在党的领导下，分工合作，开展妇女工作，动员和团结广大妇女群众，勤俭建国、勤俭持家，为建设社会主义祖国，为妇女儿童更美好的将来作出更大的贡献。亲爱的代表们，妇女群众给了我们妇女代表的光荣称号，为了很好地回答妇女群众对我们的信托，我想大家一定会想尽一切办法，根据这次大会的决议，从各个方面，利用各种机会为妇女群众服务。
　　（七）增进与世界各国妇女的友谊和团结
    现在，我要谈到我国妇女、我们妇联组织在加强同世界各国妇女的友谊和团结、共同维护世界和平方面的任务。
    保卫和平，保卫妇女权利，保卫儿童，这是我们全国妇女、母亲热切的愿望，这个愿望是同全世界妇女、母亲的心连结在一起的。为了这一个善良的愿望，根据我国政府的和平外交政策，四年来，我们妇联组织代表了全国妇女，为发展和巩固同苏联和社会主义各国妇女的团结，增进同亚、非各国和全世界各国爱好和平妇女的相互了解和友谊，作了很大的努力。我国妇女同各国妇女的友好来往是日益增多的，最近四年，全国妇联总共接待了60个国家458位外宾；派出了中国妇女自己的代表121位，赴13个国家作友好访问。在这种相互访问和接触中，我国妇女同各国妇女增进了相互的了解和友谊，同时我们又学习了许多有益的知识。
    国际民主妇女联合会自创立以来，在团结、动员世界妇女保卫和平、保卫妇女权利、保卫儿童方面作了巨大的贡献。我国妇女一贯积极支持和参加了国际妇女的和平运动。四年多来，我们曾派遣了145位代表参加了16次不同规模不同性质的国际妇女的集会。我们热烈响应并全力支持国际民主妇联提出的普遍裁减军备，完全禁止原子武器和热核子武器，立即停止试验氢弹的正义号召。
    现在以美国帝国主义为首的西方侵略集团，还在不断制造国际紧张局势，蓄意阻挠裁军协议，推行侵略战争的政策，侵占我国神圣领土台湾。我们为了保卫世界和平，反对侵略，保卫妇女儿童权利，必须进一步巩固和加强我国妇女同以苏联为首的社会主义各国妇女的亲密团结。社会主义国家的强大和团结一致，是我国进行社会主义建设的最有利的条件，是保卫世界和平和发展人类进步事业的最可靠的保证。而伟大的苏联和其他兄弟国家对我国的援助和支持，又是我国社会主义建设事业获得迅速发展的重要的条件。资产阶级右派分子恶毒地攻击我国的伟大盟邦苏联，攻击我国政府一边倒的对外政策。他们的这种荒谬的言论，是完全违背我国人民的利益和愿望的，因此受到了我们全国人民和妇女的一致谴责和唾弃。伟大的苏联人民永远是我国人民的最好的朋友和光辉的榜样，我们一定要继续坚定不移地发展和巩固同苏联妇女的亲密团结和合作，发展和巩固同其他社会主义国家妇女的亲密团结和合作，我们社会主义各国妇女这种坚如磐石的团结，是永恒的，牢不可破的。
  我们还要继续加强同亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲妇女的友谊和团结。我们中国妇女曾经长期遭受过帝国主义的压迫和奴役，我们同从殖民主义统治下解放出来的，或者正在争取解放的亚洲非洲国家、拉丁美洲国家的妇女，有许多共同的经历、处境和愿望。因此，我们十分珍贵同她们之间的友谊和团结。同时，还要加强和扩大我们同全世界各国妇女在保卫和平、保卫妇女和儿童权利的斗争中的团结，增进彼此的了解和友谊，向各国妇女学习有益的知识。
    我们看到，在我们这个时代，妇女们正在形成为一支强大的保卫世界和平的力量。不仅社会主义各国已经获得解放的妇女，是一支强大的保卫世界和平的力量，而且深受过两次世界大战的灾难的全世界各国的广大妇女，也日益觉醒起来，积极地为保卫和平、保卫妇女权利、保卫儿童而斗争。我们深信，只要全世界各国爱好和平的妇女团结起来，和全世界人民一起，那么我们就能保卫世界持久和平，就能够为妇女、儿童创造和平宁静的环境，妇女的权利、儿童的幸福就能够得到有力的保障。
    各位代表！现在我们妇女正同全国人民一起，在中国共产党领导下，进行政治、思想上的社会主义大革命，建设伟大的社会主义国家。中国共产党是领导中国人民不断地从胜利走向胜利的舵手，是照亮全国人民前进方向的灯塔。我国妇女只要坚定不移地跟中国共产党走社会主义的道路，彻底击败资产阶级右派；只要继续发挥过去艰苦奋斗的革命精神，继续发扬勤劳节俭的优良传统，以伟大的气魄，坚强的意志，勤俭建国，勤俭持家，把我们妇女的一切聪明才智贡献给国家；那么我们妇女就一定能够和全国人民一起，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会，妇女儿童就一定能够过着日益美好的生活。只要以苏联为首的社会主义的各国团结一致，只要全世界爱好和平的人民和妇女团结一致，我们就能保卫世界和平，保卫妇女和儿童的权利；我们就能在和平的国际环境中，建设社会主义祖国。亲爱的全中国的姊妹们！亲爱的代表们！让我们向着这样伟大的目标前进吧！
