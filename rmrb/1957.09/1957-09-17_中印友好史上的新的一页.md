　　A New Page in the History of Sino-Indian Friendship
    The Vice President of the Republic of India, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, is scheduled to arrive in Beijing today. Our people, with great pleasure and joy, warmly welcome the distinguished guest from our neighboring country and sincerely thank him for bringing the sincere friendship of the Indian people.
    Vice President Radhakrishnan's visit to our country will write a memorable new page in the history of Sino-Indian friendly relations. Since the mutual visits of our Premier Zhou Enlai and Indian Prime Minister Nehru three years ago, the personal contacts and friendly exchanges between the leaders and people of our two countries have become increasingly close, which fully reflects the continuous development of friendly relations between the two peoples. This visit by Vice President Radhakrishnan will undoubtedly further promote mutual understanding and traditional friendship between the people of China and India.
    Both China and India are peace-loving countries, and we have historically been on friendly terms. We have similar experiences, and we have many of the same aspirations. These factors have enabled us to establish new friendly relations under new historical conditions and to become, quite naturally, the initiators and active implementers of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Over the years, we have been pleased to see that, on the basis of the Five Principles, friendly cooperation between the two countries has greatly developed. Our trade relations are expanding day by day. Since the signing of the Sino-Indian Trade Agreement in October 1954, the trade volume between the two countries has increased more than sixfold. Our cultural ties are also growing. Both countries have continuously sent their writers, artists, scientists, and educators on friendly visits to learn from each other. The mutual exchanges between our two peoples are becoming more frequent day by day. In the past two years alone, more than 400 Indian groups have visited China for friendly exchanges; during the same period, about 200 Chinese groups and individuals have visited India for friendly exchanges. All these developments and achievements in economic and cultural exchange are not only entirely in line with the interests of the peaceful construction of the Chinese and Indian peoples, but also bring significant and beneficial impacts to the cause of world peace and international cooperation.
    Our people have always highly valued India's peaceful foreign policy and its active role in international affairs. As a major peace-loving country, India has made important contributions to stopping the Korean War, restoring peace in Indochina, initiating the Asian-African Conference, and promoting international cooperation. India has consistently opposed the establishment of hostile military aggression blocs and advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems; it firmly opposes the arms race and advocates the prohibition of atomic weapons and disarmament. The Indian government and people, together with the people of Asian and African countries, have actively supported the anti-colonialist struggles of the people of Egypt and other Asian and African countries. Both of our peoples understand that our interests are completely aligned in striving for peace, opposing colonialism, and promoting international cooperation. We also understand that in the current international situation, in the sharp struggle between peace and war, colonialism and anti-colonialism, the friendship of the one billion people of China and India is of great significance! Our common aspiration is to infinitely cherish our friendship and continuously consolidate and develop it.
    At the same time, the Indian government and people have always adopted a just position on the issue of restoring China's legitimate status in the United Nations, believing that the government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing the Chinese people and that the United Nations has no reason to deprive it of its due rights for a long time. Recently, the Indian representative to the United Nations, Arthur Lall, submitted a memorandum to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, requesting the twelfth session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the issue of restoring China's legitimate status in the United Nations. Our people sincerely express their gratitude for this friendly and just action of India.
    As an outstanding Indian scholar and politician, Vice President Radhakrishnan's achievements in academia, national political life, and international affairs are familiar and respected by our people. Vice President Radhakrishnan deeply understands the strong desire of the people of China, India, and other Asian countries for peace and freedom, and has carried out long-term and outstanding work to realize this desire. Vice President Radhakrishnan has consistently advocated friendly coexistence among the people of all countries, advocating the use of the Five Principles to resolve various international issues, and has always actively worked to promote friendly cooperation between China and India. We know that Vice President Radhakrishnan has a deep interest in China's ancient academic culture and a deep affection for the Chinese people.
    Today, we are very honored to be able to welcome Vice President Radhakrishnan, a friend of the Chinese people who has come from afar, to our capital. Let us wish Vice President Radhakrishnan a pleasant stay in our beautiful autumn season, and let us wish that the great friendship between the people of China and India will bring richer harvests with his visit.

　　中印友好史上的新的一页
    印度共和国副总统萨瓦帕利·拉达克里希南定于今天到达北京。我国人民怀着极大的愉快和喜悦的心情，热烈地欢迎来自我们邻邦的贵宾，并且衷心感谢他带来了印度人民的亲切的友谊。
    拉达克里希南副总统访问我国，将在中印友好关系史上写下值得纪念的新的一页。自从三年以前我国周恩来总理和印度尼赫鲁总理互相访问以来，我们两国政府领导人和人民之间的亲自接触和友好往来日益密切，这充分地反映了两国人民友好关系的不断发展。这次拉达克里希南副总统的访问，无疑将会进一步促进中印两国人民的相互了解和传统友谊。
    中印两国都是爱好和平的国家，我们在历史上就一直是友好相处的。我们有着类似的经历，我们有着许多相同的愿望。这些因素使我们能够在新的历史条件下，建立了新的友好关系，并且完全自然地成为和平共处五项原则的倡议者和积极执行者。几年以来，我们高兴地看到，在五项原则的基础上，两国之间友好合作已经有了很大的发展。我们两国的贸易关系正日益扩大。自从1954年10月中印贸易协定签订以来，两国之间的贸易额已增加六倍以上。我们的文化联系也在日益增进。两国曾经不断地派遣了自己的作家、艺术家、科学家和教育家进行友好访问，互相学习。我们两国人民之间的互相来往是一天比一天更加频繁了。仅在过去的两年中，印度到我国进行友好访问的团体就有四百多人；在同一时期我国到印度进行友好访问的团体和个人就有约二百人。所有这些经济文化交流的发展和成就，不仅完全符合中印两国人民和平建设的利益，而且给世界和平与国际合作事业带来了重大的有益的影响。
    我国人民对于印度的和平外交政策和它在国际事务中所起的积极作用，始终给予很高的估价。作为一个爱好和平的大国，印度曾经在停止朝鲜战争，恢复印度支那和平，倡导亚非会议，以及促进国际合作的事业中，作出了重要的贡献。印度一贯反对建立敌对性的军事侵略集团，主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处；它坚决反对军备竞赛，主张禁止原子武器和裁减军备。印度政府和人民并同亚非各国人民一起，积极支持了埃及和亚非其他国家人民的反殖民主义的斗争。我们两国人民都懂得，在争取和平，反对殖民主义，促进国际合作方面，我们的利益是完全一致的。我们并且懂得，在目前的国际局势中，在和平与战争、殖民主义与反殖民主义的尖锐斗争中，中印两国十亿人民的友谊是具有何等重大的意义！我们的共同愿望就是要无限地珍爱我们的友谊，不断地巩固和发展我们的友谊。
    同时，印度政府和人民对于恢复我国在联合国中的合法地位问题，一向采取公正的立场，认为中华人民共和国政府是唯一代表中国人民的合法政府，联合国没有理由长期剥夺它的应有的权利。最近，印度驻联合国代表阿瑟·拉尔向联合国秘书长提出一项备忘录，要求联合国大会第十二届会议讨论恢复中国在联合国的合法地位问题。我国人民对于印度的这种友好的公正的行动衷心地表示感谢。
    作为印度杰出的学者和政治家的拉达克里希南副总统，他在学术上、国家政治生活和国际事务方面的成就，是我国人民所熟悉和尊敬的。拉达克里希南副总统深切了解中印两国和亚洲各国人民对于和平和自由的强烈愿望，并为了实现这种愿望进行了长期的和卓越的工作。拉达克里希南副总统一贯主张各国人民友好相处，主张用五项原则来解决各项国际问题，并且一向积极地为促进中印两国的友好合作而努力。我们深知，拉达克里希南副总统对我国的古代学术文化有深湛的兴趣，对我国人民有深厚的感情。
    今天，我们能够在自己的首都欢迎远程来访的中国人民的朋友——拉达克里希南副总统，感到十分荣幸。让我们祝拉达克里希南副总统将在我国的秋高气爽的美好季节里，度过一段愉快的日子，让我们祝中印两国人民的伟大友谊将随着他的访问带来更丰满的收获。
