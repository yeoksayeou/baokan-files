Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 8th - The flood control struggle in Harbin has entered the most difficult stage before victory. This was pointed out by Lü Qi'en, Chief Commander of the Municipal Flood Control Headquarters and Mayor of the city, at a meeting of flood control commanders from various districts held at 8:00 AM today, based on changes in the water situation over the past two days.

After remaining at 120.06 meters for thirteen hours, the water level on the Harbin river surface rose sharply again at 3:00 AM today. By 3:00 PM, it had risen to 120.22 meters. However, after 4:00 PM, it began to fall again. By 6:00 PM, it had fallen to 120.17 meters. The wave-like rise and fall of the water level has brought great difficulties to the flood control struggle. The city's earthen dikes have suffered considerable damage after two weeks of immersion in high water levels, several attacks by wind and waves, and the erosion of the rising and falling floodwaters. Therefore, at today's meeting of flood control commanders from various districts, Lü Qi'en requested that flood control personnel, starting with leading cadres, overcome complacency and personally take turns inspecting the dikes. Especially on rainy days, they must be extremely vigilant. If any dangerous situations are discovered, no matter how difficult, they must be rescued promptly and resolutely.

In order to combat dangerous situations, the Harbin flood control department has increased the number of rescue boats, appropriately adjusted rescue materials, and assigned special personnel to be responsible for dangerous dike sections.

Today, on the Mid-Autumn Festival, in the continuous autumn rain, the 100,000-strong flood control army in Harbin is both thickening the dikes and widening the dike feet, and universally strengthening the inspection of each dike section.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 8th - In a telegram sent to the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee on the 6th, the State Council encouraged flood control personnel throughout Heilongjiang Province to ensure the safety of Harbin, strive to finally overcome the flood disaster, and extended cordial greetings to all personnel participating in the flood control struggle.

    哈尔滨防汛斗争进入胜利前最艰苦阶段
    国务院致电勉励黑龙江省防汛人员
    新华社哈尔滨8日电　哈尔滨市防汛斗争已经进入胜利前最艰苦的阶段，这是市防汛指挥部总指挥、市长吕其恩根据近两天水情的变化，在今天上午八时召开的各区防汛指挥员会议上指出的。
    哈尔滨市江面水位在一二○·○六公尺上持续了十三个小时后，今天上午三时起再次猛涨。到下午三时，已涨到一二○·二二公尺。但在四时以后，又开始回落。到六时，已落到一二○·一七公尺。水位波浪式地涨落，给防汛斗争带来了很大的困难。市区的土堤经过两个星期高水位的浸泡、几次风浪的袭击和时涨时落的洪水的冲刷，已经受到相当的损害。因此，吕其恩在今天的各区防汛指挥员会议上，要求防汛人员从领导干部起克服麻痹思想，亲自轮流查堤、巡堤。特别是阴雨天，更要百般警惕。如果发现险情，不管如何困难，都要及时坚决抢救。
    为了和险情作斗争，哈尔滨市防汛部门已经增加抢险的船只，适当调动抢险的物资，以及派专人负责险工堤段。
    今天中秋佳节，哈尔滨市在秋雨连绵的情况下，十万防汛大军一面培厚堤坝和加宽堤脚，一面对各堤段普遍加强了查险工作。
    新华社哈尔滨8日电　国务院在6日打给黑龙江省人民委员会的电报中，勉励黑龙江全省防汛人员要确保哈尔滨市的安全，争取最后战胜洪水灾害，并向参加防汛斗争的全体人员致以亲切的慰问。（附图片）
