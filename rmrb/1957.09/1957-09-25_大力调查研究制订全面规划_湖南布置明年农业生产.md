Vigorously Investigate and Research to Formulate a Comprehensive Plan
Hunan Deploys Next Year's Agricultural Production

(Our newspaper's dispatch) The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has begun planning and deploying agricultural production for the entire year of 1958. This year, the Provincial Committee summarized its experience in leading agricultural production over the years and deeply felt that even preparing for next year's production in winter could not keep up with the demands of agricultural production after cooperativization, which requires more comprehensive planning and earlier preparation. Therefore, this year, the work of formulating the agricultural production plan for the entire year of 1958 has been advanced to the autumn.

From late July to the present, under the leadership of the Provincial Committee, departments such as agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy have conducted multiple studies and discussions and have roughly determined the various agricultural production targets for the province in 1958, as well as methods to solve key problems in production such as fertilizers and water conservancy. According to preliminary materials obtained by reporters in recent days, Hunan Province requires a total grain output of 25 billion jin next year, an increase of 250 million to 300 million jin over the actual output this year. The province currently has more than 8 million pigs, and 12 million pigs are required for the entire year of 1958. In terms of water conservancy, 400,000 mu of new irrigated area will be added in 1958, 4 million mu of general irrigated area will be improved, and water conservancy projects irrigating 1.5 million mu will have the capacity to resist drought for 50 days. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hunan Provincial People's Committee will jointly issue several specific instructions on various production targets and the specific policies and measures to be taken to complete the plan. Local and county committees are now also starting to formulate plans and specifically deploy next year's production.

Before formulating the 1958 production plan, the provincial agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and other relevant departments sent working groups in May to select key cooperatives for agricultural production planning pilot projects based on the different natural conditions of mountainous, hilly, and lake areas. As early as from November of last year to March of this year, the Rural Work Department of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in cooperation with local and county committees, organized more than 2,000 cadres to conduct experience surveys of 1956 in 103 agricultural cooperatives. The data obtained from a large number of investigations and research is an important basis for Hunan Province to formulate its 1958 agricultural production plan.

    大力调查研究制订全面规划
    湖南布置明年农业生产
    本报讯　中共湖南省委着手规划和布置1958年的全年生产。省委在今年总结了历年领导农业生产的经验，深深感到即使在冬季布置来年生产，还是赶不上合作化以后农业生产更需要全面规划、及早准备的要求，因此今年就将制订1958年全年农业生产计划的工作，提早在秋季进行。
    从7月下旬到现在，在省委领导下，农业、林业、水利等部门经过多次研究和讨论，已大体确定1958年全省农业生产各项指标，以及解决生产中肥料、水利等关键问题的办法。据记者最近几天获悉的初步材料，湖南省明年的粮食总产量，要求达到二百五十亿斤，比今年实际产量增加二亿五千万到三亿斤；全省现有生猪八百多万头，1958年要求全年达到一千二百万头；在水利方面，1958年将新增加灌溉面积四十万亩，改善一般灌溉面积四百万亩，同时使灌溉一百五十万亩面积的水利工程，具有五十天的抗旱能力。中共湖南省委和湖南省人民委员会，将就各项生产指标和为了完成计划而采取的具体政策、措施等问题，联合发布若干具体指示。各地、县委现在也着手制订计划，具体布置明年生产。
    在制订1958年生产计划之前，省农业、林业、水利等有关部门，都在5月份派出工作组，根据山区、丘陵区、湖区不同的自然条件，分别选择重点社，进行农业生产规划试点。中共湖南省委农村工作部早在去年11月到今年3月，就协同地、县委，组织二千多名干部，在一百零三个农业社，进行1956年的经验调查。从大量的调查研究工作中获得的资料，是湖南省制订1958年农业生产规划的重要依据。
