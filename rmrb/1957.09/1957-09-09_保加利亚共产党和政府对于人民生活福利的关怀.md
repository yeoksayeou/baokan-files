The Bulgarian Communist Party and Government's Concern for the People's Livelihood and Welfare
Lu·Hristozov, Chairman of the State Planning Commission of the People's Republic of Bulgaria

On September 9, 1944, the working people, united in the Fatherland Front, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party and with the assistance of the Soviet army, overthrew the fascist-bourgeois rule and established a people's government.

In the first few years after liberation, the main tasks of the Party and the government were to defend national independence and territorial integrity, establish and consolidate the people's democratic regime, and rapidly restore the national economy that had been damaged during the war and the occupation by the Hitler bandits.

By 1948, the work of restoring the national economy was basically completed, and the main lifelines of the national economy had been nationalized. At the same time, the agricultural cooperative movement began to develop, which created all the necessary prerequisites for our country to build a socialist society in a planned way.

At the end of 1948, the Bulgarian Communist Party held its Fifth National Congress, which formulated and adopted the directives for the first Five-Year Plan for the national economy. The directives put forward the task of laying the socialist foundation in our country through national industrialization and electrification, as well as agricultural cooperation and mechanization.

Thanks to the creative enthusiasm of the workers, our country completed the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in four years. In 1952, industrial output more than doubled compared to 1948, and more than tripled compared to the pre-war year of 1939. While rapidly developing heavy industry, the production of consumer goods also greatly exceeded the level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. Significant achievements have also been made in the development of agriculture. More than half of the poor and middle peasants joined agricultural cooperatives.

The Sixth National Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, held in early 1954, approved the directives on the development of the national economy during the second Five-Year Plan period (1953-1957). The basic aim of the second Five-Year Plan was to ensure a sharp improvement in the material and cultural living standards of the workers on the basis of developing industrial and agricultural production.

New types of industrial sectors that did not exist or were in their infancy before September 9, 1944, such as the machine manufacturing industry, the power industry, the shipbuilding industry, the mining industry, the pulp industry, non-ferrous metallurgy, ferrous metallurgy, and the heavy chemical industry, have been established and developed in our country.

The following data on the output of several important industrial products can illustrate the speed of industrial development in our country:

	Product			Unit		Output per capita
						1939		1956
	Electricity		kWh		42		314
	Coal			kg		352		1418
	Steel			"		0.7		13
	Cement			"		36		112.6
	Cotton fabrics		meters		5.4		18.6
	Sugar			kg		4		14

With the development of industrial production, the number of industrial employees has also increased. In 1939, there were approximately 104,000 employees in industry, and in 1956, there were approximately 525,000.

We have also achieved significant achievements in the development of agriculture. Nearly 80% of the arable land and peasant households have joined agricultural cooperatives. The remaining 20%, which is cultivated by individual farmers, is in barren mountainous and semi-mountainous areas.

We can declare with pride: In the past twelve years, Bulgaria has changed from a backward agricultural country to an industrial-agricultural country.

Due to the rapid development of various sectors of the national economy, the national income has also greatly increased: from 49 billion leva (Bulgarian currency) in 1939 to 103 billion leva in 1956 (calculated at 1939 prices), which is more than double.

Due to the rapid development of productive forces and the overall improvement of the national economy, the Bulgarian Communist Party and the government have been able to implement a series of major measures to improve the material and cultural standards of our country's workers.

In recent years, the unified retail prices of food and industrial products in Bulgaria have been reduced six times, thereby increasing the purchasing power of the people by approximately 6.6 billion leva. Goods that cost 100 leva in 1952 could be bought for approximately 72 leva in 1956 by the workers in our country.

With the increase in labor productivity, the average wage of workers has also increased year by year. In addition, in the second half of 1956, according to the decision of the Party and the government, a series of important measures were implemented to increase the actual income of workers, staff, and laboring farmers:

First, the wages of low-paid employees were increased, and the minimum monthly salary in our country was set at 400 leva. This measure alone brought an extra income of 450 million leva to the workers of our country.

Second, the monthly allowances for employees' children were increased, giving workers an additional income of more than 400 million leva per year.

Third, the low pensions for employees and the pensions for agricultural cooperative members were increased. Due to the increase in pensions, the annual income of urban and rural working people has increased by an average of about 460 million leva. Almost all elderly people in our country enjoy pension benefits.

Fourth, all miscellaneous expenses of workers' canteens are paid by the state, and workers' canteens are allowed to purchase food at wholesale prices. This measure increases the actual income of employees by approximately 150 million leva.

Fifth, the state has stopped purchasing grain from rural areas in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas with lower yields, and has lowered the quota for grain purchase from all farmers. On the other hand, for certain agricultural products, the state has stopped purchasing them and has changed to purchasing them under contract.

As a result of the above measures, the average wage of employees has increased from 6,554 leva in 1952 to 7,535 leva in 1956. The second Five-Year Plan directives originally stipulated that the actual wages of employees and the actual income of farmers would increase by 40% in 1957, but in reality, it will increase by 60%.

The increase in the income and consumption of the working people only represents a part of the Party and government's concern for the material welfare of our people. The Party and government are equally concerned about improving the cultural level of the working people and increasing cultural facilities:

In 1939, there were a total of 1,031,000 students in secondary and higher education, which increased to 1,278,000 in 1957. Now, one in every six citizens in our country is studying in school.

In 1939, the health department had a total of 11,780 hospital beds, which increased to 54,400 in 1957; while the number of doctors increased from 4,330 in 1939 to 11,870 in 1957.

The People's Government is also very concerned about housing construction and municipal public construction. The annual plan for 1957 stipulates an appropriation of 465 million leva for cultural construction projects and an appropriation of 200 million leva to encourage and help individual and collective housing construction. This appropriation is more than double that of 1956.

Since September 9, 1944, especially in recent years, the face of our countryside has been completely renewed. In 1953, 1954, and 1955 alone, 25,400 houses were built in the countryside. This year, nearly 80% of the residents of the country can enjoy the convenience of electricity. There are an average of 63 radios per 1,000 residents in the country. The vast majority of towns and villages in our country have running water facilities, and we are making every effort to completely solve this problem in the next few years.

If we compare the materials that showed the living conditions of the working people in our country and the neighboring capitalist countries—Greece and Turkey—in 1955, we can more clearly see the impact of the above measures on improving the material welfare of the Bulgarian people.

In 1955, a textile worker with intermediate skill could earn 25 leva per day in Bulgaria, 37 drachmas (Greek currency) in Greece, and 10 lira (Turkish currency) in Turkey.

And in this year, the rent for a set of houses including two rooms was about 70 leva in Bulgaria, about 2,000 drachmas in Greece, and 200 to 400 lira in Turkey. That is to say, the annual rent for this type of housing is equal to 54 days' wages for Greek textile workers, 20 to 40 days' wages for Turkish textile workers, and less than 3 days' wages for Bulgarian textile workers.

The achievements made by our Party and government in improving the people's living standards and the achievements of the working people in our country are unthinkable without the selfless assistance and cooperation of the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the fraternal people's democratic countries.

The fraternal, selfless assistance in various forms provided by the Soviet Union to us is of particular importance: providing us with commodities, raw materials, and materials that our country lacks on the basis of commodity exchange, providing complete sets of equipment, machines, and devices for our factories, sending experts to help build in terms of technology, and providing technical data. In addition, the Soviet Union has also provided a low-interest loan (interest rate of 2%) of 2.1 billion rubles, which we mainly use agricultural products to repay. We are constantly expanding commodity exchange with the People's Republic of China. The value of industrial raw materials and materials and consumer goods imported from the People's Republic of China increased from 23.27 million leva in 1954 to 32.33 million leva in 1956. We are also doing our best to supply China with penicillin, certain non-ferrous metals, and agricultural products.

Studying the experience of the People's Republic of China and other people's democratic countries in the cause of socialist construction is of great significance to us, and we are using these experiences through scientific and technological cooperation and technical assistance.

Through scientific and technological cooperation, we have obtained from the People's Republic of China the data on breeding tussah silkworms and mulberry silkworms, the technical data on planting medicinal plants and rice, and the equipment for the petroleum mining industry, etc.

The Bulgarian people, united in the Fatherland Front, under the leadership of the glorious Bulgarian Communist Party, are marching forward with confidence towards a happy future—a socialist and communist society.

We believe that our cause will surely triumph. Because the struggle for a happy life is a just cause. In this struggle, we are not isolated. We receive the assistance of the great people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries, and we receive the support of all honest and progressive people in the world.

    保加利亚共产党和政府对于人民生活福利的关怀
    保加利亚人民共和国国家计划委员会主席　鲁·赫里斯托佐夫
    1944年9月9日，团结在祖国阵线中的劳动人民，在保加利亚共产党的领导以及苏联军队的援助下，推翻了法西斯—资产阶级的统治，建立了人民政权。
    解放后最初几年中，党和政府的主要任务是捍卫民族独立和国家领土完整，建立和巩固人民民主政权，并迅速恢复在战争和希特勒匪徒占领时期遭受破坏的国民经济。
    1948年，国民经济恢复工作基本结束，国民经济的主要命脉也已实行国有化，同时，农业合作化运动开始发展起来，这就为我国有计划地建设社会主义社会创造了一切必要的前提。
    1948年年底，保加利亚共产党召开了第五次代表大会，制定并通过了国民经济第一个五年计划的指示。指示中提出了通过国家工业化和电气化以及农业合作化和机械化的方法在我国奠定社会主义基础的任务。
    由于劳动者的创造热忱，我国在四年中提前完成了第一个五年计划。1952年工业产值比1948年增加了一倍多，比战前1939年增加了三倍多。与迅速发展重工业的同时，人民消费品的生产也大大地超过了五年计划规定的水平。在农业的发展中也取得了重大的成就。半数以上的贫农和中农参加了农业合作社。
    1954年年初召开的保加利亚共产党第六次代表大会，批准了关于我国在第二个五年计划期间（1953至1957年）发展国民经济的指示。第二个五年计划的基本目的是要在发展工农业生产的基础上保证急剧地提高劳动者的物质和文化生活水平。
    在我国建立了并且发展了1944年9月9日以前根本没有或处于萌芽阶段的新型工业部门，如机器制造业、电力工业、造船工业、采矿业、纸浆工业、有色冶金业、黑色冶金业、重化学工业等。
    下面几项重要工业产品产量的材料，可以说明我国工业的发展速度：
    产品	　单位　	按人口计算的产量			        1939年　  1956年
    电力　	  瓩时　	42　	  314
    煤　	  公斤　	352　	  1418
    钢材　	  ″　		0.7	　13
    水泥　	  ″		36	　112.6
    棉织品	　公尺　	5.4	　18.6
    糖		　公斤		4	　14
    随着工业生产的发展，工业从业人数也增加了。1939年工业中职工人数约十万零四千人，1956年约五十二万五千人。
    在农业的发展中我们也获得了重大的成绩。将近80％的耕地和农户已经参加农业合作社。其余的20％为个体农民耕种的土地，都在贫瘠的山区和半山区。
    我们可以怀着自豪的心情宣称：十二年来，保加利亚已经由一个落后的农业国变成工业—农业国了。
    由于国民经济各部门的迅速发展，国民收入也大大地提高了：从1939年的四百九十亿列弗（保币）增加到1956年的一千零三十亿列弗（按1939年的价格计算），即增加了一倍多。
    由于生产力的迅速发展和国民经济的全面提高，保加利亚共产党和政府就能够在提高我国劳动者物质和文化水平方面实行一系列的重大措施。
    最近几年来，保加利亚的食品和工业品的统一零售价格降低了六次，因而使得人民的购买力大约提高了六十六亿列弗。我国的劳动者在1952年花一百列弗买的商品在1956年大约用七十二列弗就能买到了。
    随着劳动生产率的提高，工人的平均工资也逐年增加。此外，在1956年下半年，根据党和政府的决定，在提高工人、职员和劳动农民的实际收入方面实行了一系列重要措施：
    第一，提高了低薪职工的工资，同时规定了我国最低月薪为四百列弗。仅此一项措施就使我国劳动者额外收益达四亿五千万列弗。
    第二，增加了按月发给的职工子女补助费，使劳动者每年多得四亿列弗以上。
    第三，提高了职工的低额抚恤金和农业社社员的抚恤金。由于抚恤金的提高，城乡劳动人民每年的收入平均增加四亿六千万列弗左右。我国几乎所有的老年人都享受养老金的待遇。
    第四，工人食堂的杂项开支全部由国家支出，并且允许工人食堂按批发价格购买食品。这项措施使职工的实际收入大约增加一亿五千万列弗。
    第五，国家已停止从产量较低的山区和半山区的农村征购粮食，并降低了向所有农民征购粮食的定额。另一方面，对某些农产品，国家已停止征购，改为按合同进行收购。
    由于采取了上述措施，职工的平均工资已由1952年的六千五百五十四列弗提高到1956年的七千五百三十五列弗。第二个五年计划指示中原规定1957年职工的实际工资和农民的实际收入提高40％，而实际上则将提高60％。
    劳动人民的收入和消费的提高只表现了党和政府对我国人民物质福利关怀的一个部分。党和政府同样关心劳动人民文化水平的提高和文化生活设施的增加：
    1939年中等和高等学校共有学生一百零三万一千人，1957年增加为一百二十七万八千人。现在我国每六个公民中就有一个人在学校中学习。
    1939年卫生部门共有病床一万一千七百八十张，1957年增加到五万四千四百张；而医生人数则从1939年的四千三百三十人，增加到1957年的一万一千八百七十人。
    人民政府对住宅建设和市政公共建设也十分关心。1957年年度计划规定文化生活建设项目拨款四亿六千五百万列弗，为鼓励和帮助个人与集体住宅建设拨款二亿列弗。这项拨款比1956年增加了一倍多。
    1944年9月9日以后，特别是最近几年来，我国农村的面貌已焕然一新。仅在1953、1954和1955年，乡村中就建设了二万五千四百座房屋。今年全国近80％的居民都可以享受用电的便利。全国每一千个居民中平均有六十三台收音机。我国绝大多数村镇都有自来水设备，我们正尽一切努力，以便在最近几年内完全解决这个问题。
    如果把1955年表明我国和邻近的资本主义国家——希腊和土耳其劳动人民生活情况的材料加以对比，就可以更明显地看出上述措施对提高保加利亚人民物质福利的影响。
    1955年，具有中等熟练程度的纺织工人，在保加利亚每天可得工资二十五列弗，在希腊可得三十七德拉马（希币），在土耳其可得十里拉（土镑）。
    而在这一年，包括两个房间的一套住宅的房租，在保加利亚大约需要七十列弗，在希腊大约须要二千德拉马，在土耳其须要二百至四百里拉。也就是说，这种住宅全年的房租等于希腊纺织工人五十四天的工资，等于土耳其纺织工人二十天至四十天的工资，而比保加利亚纺织工人三天的工资还少一些。
    没有伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国和兄弟人民民主国家无私的援助和合作，我党和政府在改善人民生活方面获得的成绩以及我国劳动人民的成就是不可思议的。
    苏联给予我们的兄弟般的、无私的、各种形式的援助有着特别重要的意义：在商品交换的基础上为我们提供我国缺少的商品、原料和材料，为我国的工厂提供成套设备、机器和装置，在技术方面派专家来帮助建设，提供技术资料。此外，苏联还给了二十一亿卢布的低利贷款（利率二厘），这种贷款我们主要用农产品来偿还。我们正不断扩大同中华人民共和国的商品交换。1954年从中华人民共和国进口的工业原料和材料以及人民消费品价值二千三百二十七万列弗，1956年增加到三千二百三十三万列弗。我们也尽自己的可能，供应中国盘尼西林、某些有色金属和农产品。
    研究中华人民共和国以及其他人民民主国家在社会主义建设事业中的经验对我们有着重要的意义，我们正在通过科学技术合作与技术援助利用这些经验。
    通过科学技术合作我们从中华人民共和国获得了繁殖柞蚕和桑蚕的资料，种植药料植物、稻米的技术资料和石油开采工业的设备等。
    团结在祖国阵线中的保加利亚人民，在光荣的保加利亚共产党的领导下，满怀信心地向着幸福的未来——社会主义社会和共产主义社会迈进。
    我们相信我们的事业一定会胜利。因为争取幸福生活的斗争是正义的事业。在这种斗争中我们不是孤立的，我们得到苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家伟大人民的援助，我们得到世界上一切正直和进步人士的支持。
