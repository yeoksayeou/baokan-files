　　The traitor and rightist element of the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) community in Henan Province, Wang Kunshan, slandered the Communist Party, saying that the Party had consistently disregarded TCM and wanted to eliminate it. Every upright TCM practitioner can use their personal experience to prove that Wang Kunshan's statement is pure fabrication. Since liberation, TCM has not been "eliminated," but has developed as never before.

　　The Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have always valued the medical heritage of the motherland. As early as 1944, Chairman Mao stipulated in the article "The United Front in Cultural Work" that the policy of uniting TCM practitioners was part of the entire cultural united front. After liberation, the Party more explicitly put forward the policy of "uniting both TCM and Western medicine." Under the guidance of this policy, TCM has made great progress in the eight years since liberation. At present, 144 TCM hospitals and more than 450 TCM outpatient clinics have been established nationwide, and public medical institutions in various regions have absorbed approximately 30,000 TCM practitioners to participate in work. In addition, more than 80 joint TCM hospitals, more than 50,000 joint clinics, and approximately 10,000 agricultural health stations have been organized, with approximately 200,000 TCM practitioners working in these medical institutions.

　　In order to train new TCM practitioners, in addition to using traditional TCM methods of apprenticeship, various regions have also established four TCM colleges in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu to train high-level TCM talents. TCM schools have been established in provinces such as Guangxi, Hebei, Tianjin, Shanxi, Jiangsu, and Jilin to train TCM professionals. In addition, TCM advanced training schools and TCM advanced training courses have been held to improve the academic level of TCM. The TCM ranks have developed rapidly, and there are currently 500,000 TCM doctors nationwide.

　　The political and social status of TCM has been greatly improved. TCM representatives participate in people's congresses and CPPCC committees at all levels. Many TCM practitioners hold leading positions in health administration departments and various medical institutions. According to incomplete statistics, twelve provinces (municipalities) across the country have absorbed TCM practitioners to serve as deputy directors (bureaus) of health departments (bureaus).

　　In order to better inherit and carry forward the medical heritage of the motherland, the Party called on Western medicine doctors to learn from TCM. At present, more than 300 senior Western medicine doctors in various provinces and cities have left production to study TCM; more than 4,800 medical personnel have participated in on-the-job training classes to learn TCM. Medical institutions in various regions have also held TCM academic lectures. Many Western medicine doctors have a general understanding of TCM's methods of analyzing disease sources, diagnosis, and treatment, and are able to apply TCM treatment methods to clinical practice. At the same time, through clinical cooperation between TCM and Western medicine, effective treatments for more than 200 diseases have been preliminarily summarized, such as in the treatment of schistosomiasis, encephalitis, diphtheria, dysentery, scarlet fever, pertussis, malaria, etc., valuable experience of TCM has been summarized.

　　This is only a part of the great achievements of TCM since liberation. Could these achievements have been imagined during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang? The rightist elements attempt to obliterate the facts; however, their black hands cannot cover the eyes and ears of the world.

### 我国中医事业空前发展

　　我国中医事业空前发展
    河南省中医界的败类、右派分子王昆山污蔑共产党说，党一贯不重视中医，要消灭中医。每个正直的中医，都可以用亲身的经历来证明王昆山的说法纯属谰言。解放以来，中医事业不是被“消灭”了，而是空前的发展了。
    中国共产党和人民政府历来是重视祖国医学遗产的。早在1944年，毛主席就在“文化工作的统一战线”一文中规定了团结中医的政策是整个文化统一战线的一部分。解放后，党更明确地提出了“团结中西医”的政策。在这个方针指导下，解放后的八年中，中医事业有了巨大的发展。目前全国已经成立了一百四十四个中医医院，四百五十多个中医门诊部，各地公立医疗机构共吸收了约三万名中医参加工作。以外还组织了联合中医医院八十余座、联合诊所五万余个、农业保健站约一万个，在这些医疗机构中工作的中医约有二十万人。
    为了培养新的中医，各地除利用中医传统的方法带徒弟以外，还在北京、上海、广州、成都创办了四所培养高级中医人才的中医学院，在广西、河北、天津、山西、江苏、吉林等省成立了中医学校，培养中医专业人员。另外，还举办了中医进修学校，中医进修班等以提高中医的学术水平。中医队伍有了飞跃的发展，目前全国已经有五十万中医师。
    中医的政治地位和社会地位大大地提高了。各级人民代表大会和各级政协都有中医代表参加。卫生行政部门和各种医疗机构也有不少中医担任领导工作。据不完全统计，全国已有十二个省（市）吸收中医担任卫生厅（局）的副厅（局）长。
    为了更好地继承和发扬祖国的医学遗产，党号召西医学习中医。目前，各省、市已经有三百多位高级西医脱离生产学习中医；有四千八百多名医务人员参加在职学习班学习中医。各地医疗机构还举办了中医学术讲座。许多西医已经对中医的分析病源的方法、诊断和治疗的方法有了概括的了解，并且能够把中医的治疗方法应用到临床上去了。同时，经过中、西医的临床合作，已经初步总结出二百多种疾病的有效疗法，如在医疗血吸虫病、脑炎、白喉、痢疾、猩红热、百日咳、疟疾等等方面，都总结了中医的宝贵经验。
    这只是解放后中医事业伟大成就的一部分。这些成就，难道在国民党反动统治时代是可以想像的么？右派分子企图抹煞事实；但是，他们的黑手是不可能掩盖天下人的耳目的。
