Intercontinental Missiles and Neutralism
　　Jiang Yuanchun

　　Dulles Plays Hypnotist Tricks

　　Dulles used to be a lawyer. This experience enables him to use some irrelevant and elusive words to cover up his predicament when American diplomacy encounters serious difficulties.

　　Please look at what he said at a press conference on August 27 about the Soviet Union's development of intercontinental missiles. He said, "We have no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the (TASS) statement, although I say that the wording of the statement was very carefully chosen, and could contain a lot of meaning, or it could contain very little meaning; in other words, if you carefully analyze what they said, there is no real definite meaning in the statement."

　　Dulles is playing hypnotist tricks on the American people and America's "allies." With a few words, he turned such a world-shaking event from "containing a lot" of meaning to "containing very little" meaning, and finally to "no" meaning. Since there is "no" meaning, the United States and its allies can rest assured and continue their sweet dreams of "power politics," without being alarmed.

　　But the facts are not like this. After the Soviet Union announced the development of intercontinental missiles, the White House, the State Department, and the Department of Defense of the United States, despite outwardly "maintaining extreme silence," secretly conducted tense "consultations," "cautiously" "consulting" for two days, until August 27th evening, when Acting Secretary of Defense Quarles came forward to issue a statement saying that the missile's "current military significance is greatly exaggerated."

　　The American press, which reflects the opinions of the American ruling group, was not so "calm." The "New York Herald Tribune" immediately shouted: The Soviet invention "greatly changed the balance of world power." The Associated Press also said, "It will seriously affect the balance of world power." Obviously, these bourgeois commentators instinctively felt the danger of this Soviet invention to the American policy of aggression and couldn't help but shout it out. They didn't have Dulles' foresight to think about what impact such a complete disclosure would have on America's "allies."

　　Will "Allies" "Escape for Their Lives"?

　　The attitude of America's Western European "allies" is very subtle.

　　The Soviet announcement "greatly surprised" Western Europe. A British Foreign Office spokesman was "simply not prepared to make any comment." However, ministers and military leaders conducted a series of tense consultations. Neither British nor French officials have issued any formal opinions, and people close to the government and newspapers have tried their best to emphasize that the "accuracy" of the Soviet intercontinental missile is still a problem in order to stabilize people's minds. Only British Defense Minister Sandys, who was visiting Australia, publicly expressed concern about the "tendency" to believe the Soviet announcement and asked everyone to "be careful not to exaggerate."

　　However, Sandys, who advocated the development of missiles, was quickly criticized at home. The British "News Chronicle" believes that after the Soviet Union invented intercontinental missiles, Britain should not engage in missile competition, otherwise it would "only waste its energy" and "become the frog in Aesop's fable who desperately inflated himself in order to look like a bull." The British "Daily Herald" reported on September 2 that the heads of the British Navy, Army, and Air Force all opposed Sandys' strategy of "canceling fighter pilots and developing missiles." Bevan of the British Labour Party expressed the thoughts of most Britons in the "World News" on September 1. He said that because the Soviet Union invented intercontinental missiles, no country can be used as a bombing base "prepared for sacrifice." And everyone knows that the British Isles are being used by the United States as such a base.

　　Those Western European countries with neutralist tendencies have not issued official opinions. Newspapers in Rome, Italy, published the news but did not comment. The opinion of an officer of the Swedish General Staff is probably the most typical. He said, "If the Russians have multi-stage long-range missiles, it just means that they will shoot over our heads in Sweden." This situation forced Norstad, Supreme Commander of the European Allied Forces of the North Atlantic Group, to come out to cheer up the "allies," boasting that the "advantage" is still in the hands of the North Atlantic Group, so there is "no reason to feel discouraged due to the Soviet announcement."

　　The situation in West Germany is the most interesting. The Soviet Union's invention of intercontinental missiles proved that the Adenauer government's policy of following the United States has completely failed, which undoubtedly has a significant impact on the ongoing election campaign in West Germany. Therefore, Adenauer and Defense Minister Strauss pretended to be ignorant and expressed disbelief in the facts. However, Balwolf, a military affairs expert for the West German "Die Welt," pointed out bluntly that the United States is now "in the most unfavorable position it has ever been in." As the "Washington Post" pointed out, the United States is now anxiously watching the development of the situation in West Germany, fearing that the failure of "power politics" will cause West Germany to "join the large-scale game of 'escaping for their lives'," leading to the complete collapse of the North Atlantic Group.

　　"Power Politics" Cannot Hold Up

　　The development of neutralism in Western Europe and the world due to the bankruptcy of American "power politics" is precisely what the American ruling group fears most. How to prop up "power politics" so that it still looks like something in order to maintain those already unstable military blocs is what the American ruling group is now trying to do.

　　The Soviet Union already has intercontinental missiles, which is an undeniable fact. The United States is making a fuss about the accuracy of missile strikes, saying that "multi-stage missiles are fundamentally impossible to be very accurate. It is a quick fix weapon." However, according to Soviet newspaper reports, the hit error of Soviet intercontinental missiles does not exceed ten to twenty kilometers. For a large area target, this error of a missile equipped with a nuclear warhead is nothing.

　　Using the accuracy issue will not convince people. Therefore, the United States is also promoting that it is researching anti-missile missiles. This is at least a myth at present. Intercontinental missiles travel at a speed of 16,000 kilometers per hour. For weapons traveling at such a high speed, it is difficult to imagine anything that can stop them. The Associated Press has said that so far, it is not known what methods can be used to defend against this type of rocket.

　　Moreover, these propaganda cannot support the American "power politics." The intercontinental missiles that the United States itself used to boast about, according to Senator Jackson, will not be obtained as early as expected due to "huge mistakes in the process of researching and developing these weapons." Therefore, the United States is trying its best to boast about its medium-range missiles and strategic air force, saying that because the United States has military bases in Europe and the Middle East, these missiles are more useful than intercontinental missiles. Of course, the United States did not simultaneously state that Soviet medium-range missiles are equally useful for these American bases.

　　In order to show the last bit of capital of the American "power politics," the United States launched three medium-range missiles in a row at the end of August. U.S. Army Secretary Bruck even boasted that the one launched on August 28 was "a great success." However, these three medium-range missiles were too disappointing and all failed. One exploded on the launch pad; one changed course after being launched due to a malfunction of the device and exploded in the air; the third caught fire in the jet pipe after flying for a distance and fell into the sea.

　　What else can be boasted about? American "power politics" has definitely failed. It is no longer possible to suppress neutralism in Europe and Asia simply by boasting about the power of American nuclear weapons. Therefore, the United States is now stepping up its control over the intermediate zone, even at all costs. American newspapers openly pointed out that the United States is currently intensifying its aggression against Syria in the Middle East in order to "counter" the tendency of neutralism, which has become stronger in the world due to the Soviet Union's development of intercontinental missiles, and to prevent this tendency from spreading to Europe, Africa, and South Asia.

　　However, this approach by the United States is futile. No matter how the United States struggles, the fact that the Soviet Union has developed intercontinental missiles, as evidence of the increasing strength of peaceful forces, will have a profound impact on international politics and vigorously promote the cause of maintaining world peace. While announcing the development of intercontinental missiles, the Soviet Union firmly advocated the prohibition of atomic weapons and nuclear weapons. This open and aboveboard attitude has been welcomed by peace-loving people all over the world. The whole world is now watching the United States to see what reasons it still has to persist in its unreasonable position of being able to use atomic weapons and nuclear weapons.

　　The American aggressor group is now in a panic.

　　洲际导弹和中立主义
　　蒋元椿
    杜勒斯玩弄催眠术
    杜勒斯曾经当过律师。这个经历使他在美国外交碰到严重困难的时候能够用一些不着边际、捉摸不定的词句，来掩饰自己所处的窘境。
    请看他在8月27日记者招待会上关于苏联制成洲际导弹的一席话。他说，“我们没有理由来怀疑（塔斯社）声明的真实性，虽然我说声明的用字是经过十分仔细的挑选的，可以包含很多的意思，也可以包含很少的意思；换句话说，如果你仔细地分析一下他们所说的话，声明中并没有真正确切的意思。”
    杜勒斯是在对美国人民和美国的“盟国”们玩催眠术。他用几句话就把这样一件震惊世界的大事，从“包含很多”意思变到“包含很少”意思，最后变成了“没有”意思。既然“没有”意思，美国和它的盟国就可以安心做它们的“实力政策”的甜梦，用不着大惊小怪了。
    可是事实却又并非如此。在苏联宣布制成洲际导弹以后，美国的白宫、国务院和国防部尽管表面上“保持绝顶的沉默”，暗地里却进行着紧张的“协商”，一直“谨慎地”“协商”了两天，到8月27日晚上，才由国防部代理部长卡利斯出面发表声明说，导弹“在当前的军事意义被大大地夸大了”。
    反映美国统治集团意见的美国报界却没有这样“沉着”。“纽约先驱论坛报”立刻大叫道：苏联的发明“大大改变了世界力量的对比”。美联社也说，“它将严重影响世界力量的对比。”显然，这些资产阶级评论家本能地感觉到了苏联这一发明对于美国侵略政策的危险，情不自禁地叫了出来。他们没有像杜勒斯那样的深谋远虑，想到这样和盘托出对于美国的那些“盟国”会有什么影响。
    “盟国”将“各自逃命”吗？
    美国的西欧“盟国”的态度是很微妙的。
    苏联的宣布使西欧“为之大吃一惊”。英国外交部发言人“根本不准备作任何评论”。但是部长们和军事首脑们却进行了一系列紧张的磋商。英国和法国官方都没有发表任何正式的意见，接近政府的人士和报纸则竭力强调苏联洲际导弹的“精确性”还是个问题，以便安定人心。只有正在澳大利亚访问的英国国防大臣桑迪斯对于已经有了一种相信苏联的宣布的“倾向”公开感到不安，要求大家“应该小心，不要言过其实”。
    可是，主张发展导弹的桑迪斯在国内很快就受到了批评。英国“新闻记事报”认为，在苏联发明洲际导弹以后，英国不应该进行导弹竞争，否则“只会浪费自己的精力”，“变成伊索寓言中为了使自己看起来像公牛而拚命鼓气膨胀的青蛙”。英国“每日先驱报”在9月2日报道说，英国海、陆、空军首脑都反对桑迪斯的“取消战斗机驾驶员而发展导弹”的战略。英国工党的比万在9月1日的“世界新闻报”上表达了大多数英国人的想法。他说，由于苏联发明了洲际导弹，任何国家都不可能被用作“准备牺牲的”轰炸机基地了。而大家知道，英伦三岛正是被美国用来作这样的基地的。
    西欧那些具有中立主义倾向的国家，都没有发表官方的意见。意大利罗马的报纸刊登了消息，但是没有评论。瑞典参谋部的一位军官的意见，大概是最典型的了。他说，“如果俄国人拥有多阶段的长射程导弹的话，那只不过是说，它将从我们瑞典人的头上射过去而已。”这种情况使得北大西洋集团欧洲盟军最高统帅诺斯塔德不得不出来给“盟国”们打气，吹嘘“优势”仍然在北大西洋集团手里，因此“没有理由由于苏联的宣布而感到气馁”。
    西德的情况最有意思。苏联发明洲际导弹，证明了阿登纳政府追随美国的政策已经彻底失败，对于西德正在进行的竞选运动无疑有重大的影响。因此，阿登纳和国防部长斯特劳斯都装痴作傻，表示不相信实有其事。可是西德“世界报”的军事问题专家巴尔沃耳夫却不客气地指出，美国现在“处于前所未有的最不利的地位”。如“华盛顿邮报”所指出的，美国现在正在焦急地注视着西德情况的发展，害怕“实力政策”的失败会使西德“加入‘各自逃命’这场大规模的游戏”，以至于北大西洋集团完全垮台。
    “实力政策”撑不起来
    由于美国“实力政策”破产而引起西欧和世界中立主义的发展，这正是美国统治集团最害怕的东西。怎样把“实力政策”撑起来，使它看来仍然像个样子，以便维系那些早已不稳的军事集团，这就是美国统治集团现在正在竭力设法做到的事情。
    苏联已经有了洲际导弹，这是无法否定的事实了。美国就在导弹命中的精确性上做文章，说什么“多阶段导弹是根本不可能十分精确的。它是一种速成武器”。可是根据苏联报纸的报道，苏联洲际导弹的命中误差不超过十到二十公里。对于一个大面积的目标来说，装有核弹头的导弹的这一点误差算不了什么。
    用精确性问题是说服不了人的了。于是美国又宣传它正在研究反导弹的导弹。这至少在目前来说，还是一种神话。洲际导弹以每小时一万六千公里的速度前进。对于以这样高的速度前进的武器，很难设想有可以阻挡的东西。美联社就说过，迄今为止，还不知道有什么办法来防备这种火箭。
    而且，这些宣传并不能支持美国的“实力政策”。美国自己过去一贯吹嘘的洲际导弹，据参议员杰克逊说，由于在“研究和发展这些武器的过程中犯了巨大的错误”，不会如所预期那样早地得到。因此，美国就竭力吹嘘它的中程导弹和战略空军，说什么由于美国在欧洲和中东有军事基地，所以这种导弹比洲际导弹更为有用。当然，美国没有同时说明，苏联的中程导弹对于这些美国基地也同样有用。
    为了显示美国“实力政策”的最后一点资本，美国在8月底接连发射了三枚中程导弹。美国陆军部长布鲁克并且吹牛说，8月28日发射的一枚是“一个伟大的成功”。可是，这三枚中程导弹太不争气，全都失败了。一枚在发射台上炸毁；一枚发射出去以后由于装置运行失灵而改变航向，在空中炸毁；第三枚在飞行了一段路程以后，喷气管起火，堕入海中。
    还有什么可吹的呢？美国的“实力政策”是肯定地失败了。单凭吹嘘美国的核武器威力，现在已经不可能压制住欧洲和亚洲的中立主义。因此，美国现在正在加紧对中间地带的控制，甚至不惜使用一切手段。美国报纸公开指出，美国目前在中东对叙利亚加紧侵略，就是为了“反击”世界上由于苏联制成洲际导弹而更形强烈的中立主义倾向，防止这种倾向传播到欧洲、非洲和南亚去。
    但是，美国这种手段是徒劳的。不管美国如何挣扎，苏联制成洲际导弹这件事，作为和平力量日益强大的证据，在国际政治上将发生深远的影响，有力地促进维护世界和平的事业。苏联在宣布制成洲际导弹的同时，坚决主张禁止原子武器和核武器。这种光明磊落的态度受到全世界爱好和平的人民的欢迎。全世界现在都注视着美国，看它还有什么理由坚持可以使用原子武器和核武器的无理立场。
    美国侵略集团现在狼狈周章了。
