This Dispatch from Tianjin, September 2nd: The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA) and the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce (FIC) held a joint meeting of all committee members on August 30th, discussing and passing the work plan for a comprehensive rectification movement within the Tianjin business community. According to this plan, the Tianjin business community will comprehensively launch a rectification movement, including the struggle against the Rightists, starting in September.

This work plan, based on the three different situations of private individuals within Tianjin's joint public-private enterprises, stipulates that the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement will be carried out in phases, in batches, and crosswise.

1.  Among the core elements of the city's business community (including members of the CDNCA and FIC, members of the municipal and district FIC, and members of trade associations, as well as representatives of the business community who do not fall into the aforementioned categories, totaling approximately two thousand people), a thorough and in-depth anti-Rightist struggle will be launched. Then, based on the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, a general rectification will be carried out. The standing committee members and some committee members of the Municipal FIC and the Municipal Committee of the CDNCA, totaling about one hundred people, have been centrally involved in the anti-Rightist struggle in the city in the past, and will continue to be centrally involved in the anti-Rightist struggle and rectification. The remaining core elements will return to their respective districts to participate in the anti-Rightist struggle and rectification. Each district will formulate specific plans based on the specific circumstances within the district. The plan specifically emphasizes that attention should be paid to organizing and training the ranks, and cultivating and expanding the backbone forces in the anti-Rightist struggle.

2.  Among general capitalists and capitalist agents (including private administrative management personnel in key factories and enterprises with sections or shares in the industrial sector, and private administrative management personnel in general stores or large department stores in the commercial sector, totaling approximately eight thousand people), a rectification movement will be carried out in the form of a socialist great debate. The content of the debate will mainly focus on the six criteria proposed by Chairman Mao in his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and the special characteristics of the business community pointed out by Minister Li Weihan. Through debate, combined with the experience and lessons of the anti-Rightist struggle, and in connection with personal thoughts, criticism and self-criticism will be conducted to achieve a profound effect of ideological remolding. Due to the large number of people participating in the great debate, the plan stipulates that districts should generally divide groups according to general factories and general stores, and according to the specific circumstances of each district, and with reference to the deployment of the great debate among the factory and store workers in each district, carry out the debate in phases and batches.

3.  For the city's more than 30,000 small industrialists and merchants, repeated and popular education on opposing the Rightists, breaking the capitalist standpoint, and establishing the socialist standpoint should be conducted. The educational methods are mainly to use easy-to-understand and in-depth forms to formulate teaching materials, adopt special reports, conduct positive education, and combine the content of the reports to organize debates. In the debates, it is required to connect with reality, present facts, reason things out, carry out free debates, distinguish right from wrong, raise awareness, transform thinking, and establish a socialist standpoint. During the lectures and debates, appropriate visual education can be interspersed, such as organizing film screenings, visiting factories and agricultural cooperatives. Typical figures can also be selected to share their experiences to enhance the educational effect. Each district will hire lecturers and counselors to conduct lectures and guide the debate, and can, according to the specific circumstances, organize debates in groups according to industry in phases and batches, and organize reports by region.

Regarding organizational leadership, the plan stipulates that the comprehensive rectification movement in the city's business community must closely rely on the leadership of the Party committees at all levels. Under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Committee of the CDNCA and the Municipal FIC have established a joint office to uniformly manage the daily work. Each district should establish a joint office by the district branch of the CDNCA and the district FIC under the leadership of the district Party committee to carry out the work. Each district can also organize working groups according to the industrial system as needed. These working groups should invite representatives from the public sector to participate.

In terms of time arrangement, in addition to the continued in-depth development of the anti-Rightist struggle of core elements, the great debate among general capitalists and capitalist agents will begin in mid-September and will be carried out in phases and batches. The specific plan will be determined by the district. The anti-Rightist struggle education and socialist education for small industrialists and merchants will also begin in mid-September and will be carried out in phases and batches. The term of the comprehensive rectification in the city's business community is tentatively set for six months, and will be extended if necessary.

Socialist education for small vendors will be suggested to be carried out separately by relevant parties. Rectification plans for suburban industrialists and merchants will also be formulated separately.

The plan finally emphasized: During the period of the comprehensive rectification movement in the city's business community, it is also the time when the campaign for increasing production and practicing economy is being carried out in depth and the peak commercial season is coming. Therefore, proper arrangements should be made to ensure that rectification and business are not delayed.

This Dispatch from Shenyang, September 2nd: Gong Tianmin, Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, told reporters today that the Liaoning area business community has decided to immediately launch a comprehensive rectification movement. He said that judging from the situation of the anti-Rightist struggle in the previous period, it is now a very urgent task for the business community to carry out a rectification movement to break the capitalist standpoint and establish a socialist standpoint. In the past, some people said that the industrialists and merchants here were relatively easy to ideologically remold because they had little capital, were young, and had technical skills. Now the facts prove that this is not the case. Among the executive committee members of the Federations of Industry and Commerce in nine cities and three counties, a group of Rightists and several Rightist groups have been exposed. This fact shows that there are still a considerable number of people in the business community who verbally support socialism, but behind their backs they are opposing the leadership of the Party and attempting to restore capitalism. Therefore, we believe that Minister Li Weihan's talk on comprehensively launching a rectification movement in the business community is very necessary and we fully support it.

Gong Tianmin also said that the rectification movement in Liaoning will be carried out in two steps: The first step is to carry out criticism and self-criticism among the executive committee members of the provincial, municipal, and county Federations of Industry and Commerce, based on the anti-Rightist struggle and according to the six criteria put forward by Chairman Mao. Among them, three points will be focused on: the issue of treating the working class and the leadership of the Party; the issue of treating the socialist system; and the issue of ideological remolding. The second step is to carry it out universally among grassroots industrialists and merchants. The CDNCA and the FIC will jointly establish a rectification leading group as the rectification leading organization.

Gong Tianmin finally said that he recently visited several cities and counties, and the industrialists and merchants in these places are generally willing to actively participate in the rectification and demand to pass the socialist test politically.

    天津工商界提出整风方案
    辽宁工商界的整风将分两步进行
    本报天津2日电  民建天津市委和天津市工商联在8月30日举行全体委员联席会议，讨论和通过了天津市工商界全面开展整风运动的工作方案。按照这个方案，天津市工商界将从9月份起，全面开展包括反右派斗争在内的整风运动。
    这个工作方案，按照天津市公私合营企业内的私方人员的三种不同情况，规定分期分批地和交叉地进行反右派斗争和整风运动。
    一、在全市工商界骨干分子中（包括民建工商界的会员、市和区的工商联委员以及同业公会委员，还有不属于前述范围的工商界代表人士，共约两千人左右），将普遍深入地展开反右派斗争，然后在反右派斗争胜利的基础上，进行一般的整风。市工商联和民建市委的常委和部分委员共约百余人，过去集中在市进行反右派斗争，今后仍然集中在市进行反右派斗争和整风；其余的骨干分子，则各归各区参加反右派斗争和整风。各区将根据区内具体情况安排具体计划。方案中特别强调，在反右派斗争中要注意组织和训练队伍，培养和扩大骨干力量。
    二、在一般资本家和资本家代理人中（包括工业方面的基点厂和有科或股组织的企业的私方行政管理人员，商业方面的总店或大型门市部的私方行政管理人员，共约八千人左右），采取开展社会主义大辩论的形式进行整风。辩论的内容主要是毛主席在关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题的讲演中所提出的六条标准和李维汉部长指出的工商界的特殊性问题。通过辩论，并结合反右派斗争的经验教训，联系个人的思想进行批评与自我批评，以取得深刻的思想改造效果。由于参加大辩论的人数较多，方案中规定各区一般按总厂、总店划分小组，并根据各区具体情况，参照各区厂、店职工开展大辩论的部署，分期分批地进行。
    三、对全市三万多小型工商业者，要反复多次地、通俗地进行反对右派、破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场的普及教育。教育方法主要是用通俗易懂、深入浅出的形式，制订教材，采取专题报告方式，进行正面教育，并结合报告内容组织辩论。在辩论中要求联系实际、摆事实、讲道理，开展自由争论，明辨是非，提高认识，改造思想，树立社会主义立场。在讲课和辩论过程中，可适当穿插形象化教育，如组织看电影，参观工厂和农业合作社等。也可选择典型人物现身说法，以增强教育效果。各区将聘请讲师和辅导员，进行讲课和辅导辩论工作，并可根据具体情况，分期分批地按行业编组进行辩论，按片组织报告。
    关于组织领导问题，方案中规定，全市工商界全面开展的整风运动，必须紧紧依靠各级党委的领导。在党的市委领导下，民建市委和市工商联已成立联合办公室，统一掌握日常工作的进行。各区应在党的区委领导下，由区民建支部和区工商联成立联合办公室，开展工作。各区还可根据需要，按行业系统组织工作组，这种工作组应邀请公方代表参加。
    在时间安排方面，除骨干分子的反右派斗争仍然继续深入开展以外，一般资本家和资方代理人中的大辩论将在9月中旬开始，分期分批进行，具体计划由区决定。对小型工商业者的反右派斗争教育和社会主义教育，也将在9月中旬开始，分期分批进行。全市工商界全面整风的期限暂定半年，必要时再延长。
    对小商贩的社会主义教育，将建议有关方面另外进行。郊区工商业者的整风方案也要另行规定。
    这个方案最后强调指出：在全市工商界全面开展整风运动期间，正值增产节约运动深入开展和商业旺季到来，因此，应妥善加以安排，切实作到整风与业务两不误。
    本报沈阳2日电  辽宁省工商联主任委员巩天民今天告诉记者说，辽宁地区的工商界决定立即全面开展整风运动。他说，从前一时期的反右派斗争情况来看，目前开展一个破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场的整风运动是工商界十分迫切的任务。过去有人说，这里的工商业者由于资本少、年龄轻、有技术，因此思想改造似乎是比较容易的。现在事实证明并非如此。在九个市三个县的工商联执委中，已被揭发出一批右派分子和几个右派集团。这一事实说明，在工商界中还有相当一部分人，口头上是拥护社会主义的，但在背后干的却是反对党的领导，企图使资本主义复辟。因此，我们对李维汉部长关于在工商界中全面开展整风运动的谈话，认为非常必要，完全拥护。
    巩天民还说，辽宁地区的整风运动将分为两步进行：第一步是在省、市、县工商联执委中进行，在反右派斗争的基础上，根据毛主席提出的六条标准，进行批评和自我批评。其中将着重检查三点：对待工人阶级和党的领导问题；对待社会主义制度问题；对待思想改造的问题。第二步是在基层工商业者中普遍进行。由民建和工商联联合建立整风领导小组，作为整风领导机构。
    巩天民最后说，他最近跑了几个市县，这些地方的工商业者普遍愿意积极参加整风，要求在政治上过好社会主义这一关。
