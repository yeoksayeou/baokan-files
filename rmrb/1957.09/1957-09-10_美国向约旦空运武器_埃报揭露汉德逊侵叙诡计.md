Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Washington News: The United States government began airlifting weapons from bases in the United States, North Africa, and Europe to Jordan on September 8th. A batch of seventy-five tons of weapons is scheduled to arrive in Jordan today. U.S. authorities will also implement an emergency plan to train Jordanian soldiers in the use of these weapons. The U.S. shipment of weapons to Jordan follows Dulles' statement that the U.S. would directly intervene in the Syrian situation.

According to U.S. officials, the U.S. is planning to strengthen its military mission in Jordan in order to oppose Syria.

It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, who has just returned to London from Yugoslavia, expressed support for this action. He believes that the Western countries' supply of arms to the Middle East is "inevitable."

Meanwhile, news from Paris said that the French Foreign Ministry spokesman also stated on the 8th that the French government "fully agreed" with Dulles' aggressive statement on the 7th.

Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Cairo News: According to a report in "Al-Gomhuria" on the 8th, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson, who recently returned home after activities in the Middle East, put forward three courses of action for invading Syria:

First, not directly by the United States, but by a pro-Western Middle Eastern country (possibly Jordan, Lebanon, or Iraq) taking some kind of military action;

Second, to formulate a plan for the remaining pro-Western elements to launch a coup in Syria, even if it only lasts for an hour, so that the United States can intervene at the request of the coup leaders. This possibility has been diminished as the Syrian government strives to purge conspirators from the army and government agencies;

Third, even at the risk of oil ceasing to flow to the West, to carry out economic, diplomatic, and political boycotts against Syria, in addition to carrying out sabotage work within Syria.

    美国向约旦空运武器
    埃报揭露汉德逊侵叙诡计
    新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府从9月8日起开始从美国、北非以及欧洲各处的基地向约旦空运武器。一批七十五吨重的武器定今天运到约旦。美国当局还将实行一个训练约旦士兵使用这些武器的紧急计划。美国向约旦运送武器，是在杜勒斯发表美国要直接干涉叙利亚局势的声明后随即进行的。
    据美国官员透露，为了反对叙利亚，美国正在计划加强它在约旦的军事代表团。
    据报道，刚从南斯拉夫回到伦敦的英国外交大臣劳埃德表示支持这一行动。他认为西方国家向中东输送军火是“不可避免”的。
    同时，从巴黎传出的消息说，法国外交部发言人也在8日表示，法国政府“完全赞成”杜勒斯7日发表的侵略性的声明。
    新华社9日讯　开罗消息：据“共和国报”8日报道，最近到中东活动后回国的美国副国务卿帮办汉德逊提出了侵略叙利亚的三项行动方针。
    第一，不直接由美国而由一个亲西方的中东国家（可能是约旦、黎巴嫩或伊拉克）采取某种军事行动；
    第二，制订计划，由残余亲西方分子在叙利亚发动一个政变，即使是一小时也好，那样，美国就可以应政变领袖们的要求进行干涉。这种可能性已经由于叙利亚政府竭力肃清军队、政府机构中的阴谋分子而缩小；
    第三，甚至在冒石油停止流向西方的危险下，除了在叙利亚境内进行破坏工作外，对叙利亚进行经济、外交和政治抵制。
