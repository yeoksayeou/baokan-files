　　Claiming Eighteen Years of Revolution is a Pure Lie
　　Li Zegang Was Originally Li Pinxian's Henchman
　　(Our correspondent from Hefei, September 15th) Li Zegang, Deputy Director of the Cultural Bureau of Anhui Province, Curator of the Provincial Museum, and Alternate Member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, has recently had his disguise stripped away, revealing his true colors.

　　After the People's Daily published the editorial "What Is the Reason for This?", Li Zegang took the opportunity to attack, saying that "there are also people among the 12 million Party members who would write this letter" (referring to the anonymous letter received by Lu Yuwen mentioned in the editorial). He was extremely dissatisfied with the anti-hidden counter-revolutionaries movement, saying that "the Cultural Bureau wrongly accuses good people and violates laws and regulations." Why was he so hostile to the anti-hidden counter-revolutionaries movement? It turns out that the counter-revolutionary elements who were detained and struggled against in the anti-hidden counter-revolutionaries movement and refused to confess were all confidants he tried his best to place in the museum, including a current counter-revolutionary element who styled himself as the "Premier of the State Council."

　　This Li Zegang, who claimed to have "eighteen years of revolution" and "wholehearted devotion and love for the Communist Party," actually followed Zhang Bojun as a deserter during the Great Revolution. From 1939 until the eve of liberation, he relied on Li Pinxian, the bandit who ruled Anhui, serving as Li Pinxian's personal advisor, member of the pseudo-provincial government council, and member of the senate. He also successively held positions such as director and deputy director of the collection section of the pseudo-provincial cultural work committee, the cultural work committee of the pseudo-Henan-Hubei-Anhui border region party and government branch, the pseudo-provincial war history collection committee, and the pseudo-provincial literature society and other anti-communist cultural organizations. He used these pseudo-positions to actively collect counter-revolutionary documents and information about our Party, government, and military, and held exhibitions glorifying the Kuomintang's leadership in the victory against Japan and Li Pinxian's "achievements in governing Anhui," and wrote "A True Record of Chairman Li's Governance of Anhui" to praise Li Pinxian.

　　In the early days of liberation, Li Zegang instructed his confidants to destroy a large number of pseudo-archives without authorization, burn all the archives of the Kuomintang district branch, and secretly remove or alter some of the collected counter-revolutionary documents.

　　Li Zegang harbored landlords during the land reform. Even now, he is still concealing his reactionary identities as the secretary of the Kuomintang district branch and member of the pseudo-provincial General Mobilization Committee for Suppressing Rebellion.

　　Recently, the Provincial Museum discovered fifty pieces of rifles, assassination weapons, hand grenades, and various military knives in the process of clearing the cultural relic warehouse, as well as two Kuomintang flags. Regarding these weapons, the government had discovered them shortly after liberation and asked him to transfer them to the military region, but he delayed until 1955 before handing over a portion of the weapons that Li Pinxian had allocated to the pseudo-literature society for "safekeeping" in 1947, but still privately retained a portion of the weapons and Kuomintang flags, placing them in his cultural relic warehouse.

### 自称革命十八年纯是谎话  李则纲原来是李品仙的爪牙

　　自称革命十八年纯是谎话
　　李则纲原来是李品仙的爪牙
    本报合肥15日电  安徽省文化局副局长、省博物馆馆长、民盟中央候补委员李则纲的伪装最近被剥下来，现出了原形。
    人民日报发表“这是为什么”的社论后，李则纲就借机进行攻击，说“一千二百万党员中也有人会写这封信”（指社论中提到的卢郁文接到的匿名信）。他对肃反运动极端不满，说“文化局冤枉好人，违法乱纪”。他为什么这样仇视肃反运动呢？原来在肃反中被关和被斗争的拒不交代的反革命分子，都是他想尽办法安置到博物馆来的亲信，其中还有自封“政务院总理”的现行反革命分子。
    这个自称“革命十八年”、“忠心耿耿，热爱共产党”的李则纲，却原来在大革命时期就追随章伯钧当了逃兵。从1939年到解放前夕，他投靠统治安徽的李匪品仙，担任李品仙的私人顾问、伪省府咨议、参议委员等职，还历任伪省文化工作委员会、伪豫鄂皖边区党政分会文化工作委员会、伪省抗战史料征集委员会及伪省文献会等反共文化组织的采集股主任、副主任。他利用这些伪职，积极收集反革命文件和我党政军情况，并举办过所谓国民党领导抗日胜利和李品仙“治皖功绩”的展览，又撰写“李主席治皖实录”为李品仙歌功颂德。
    解放初期，李则纲指使其亲信擅自销毁大批伪档案；烧掉国民党区分部的全部档案，并把收藏的部分反革命文件暗中抽掉或涂改。
    李则纲在土改期间窝藏过地主。直到现在他还隐瞒他的国民党区分部书记和伪省戡乱动员委员会委员等反动身份。
    最近，省博物馆在清理文物仓库中又发现步枪、暗杀武器、手榴弹及各种军用刀达五十件；还有国民党旗两面。关于这些武器，在解放后不久，政府就已发觉，要他移交给军区，而他却拖到1955年才将李品仙在1947年拨给伪文献会“保管”的一部分武器交出，但仍私行留下一部分武器和国民党旗，放在他的文物仓库中。
