    Report from our newspaper: Shenyang City, with its 500,000 industrial workers, has seen over sixty factories launch large-scale rectification and socialist education movements in the past week.

    The enthusiasm of the employees is extremely high during the "Great Blooming and Contending." Workers at the Huanggu District Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory posted over 3,500 big-character posters in three days, raising over 4,500 suggestions. The statistics from the No. 3 Workshop of the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant show that each worker posted an average of more than two big-character posters. During lunch breaks, the dozens of writing stations in the factory were crowded with people writing big-character posters. Groups of employees gathered in front of the big-character posters, reading and discussing; some of the cadres who were criticized were diligently recording the opinions of the masses.

    The most profound impression gained by reporters who recently interviewed in some factories is that the vast majority of opinions raised by employees during the "Great Blooming and Contending" are well-intentioned, positive, and correct; the proportion of erroneous opinions is very small. According to an analysis of 400 big-character posters and 1,300 suggestions in the No. 3 Workshop of the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant, well-intentioned criticisms accounted for more than 90%.

    The criticisms raised by employees in various factories during the "Great Blooming and Contending" cover a wide range, with criticisms of leadership style accounting for the largest proportion. Regarding factory-level leading cadres, the most common opinions from the masses are: too many meetings, too little going into the field, and insufficient concern for the hardships of the masses. The most frequent criticisms of workshop-level cadres are commandism and a simple, crude work style. Many people criticized the phenomena of top-heavy organizations, poor planning, chaotic management, and serious waste in factory production management. One big-character poster in the Huanggu District Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory stated: "The number of cadres we have in our factory is enough to manage two factories of the same scale. I suggest that the relevant central departments consider transferring some of the cadres in enterprises to take turns going to the countryside to support agricultural production." Another big-character poster titled "Cadre Workshop" criticized the Locomotive Workshop for increasing its number of cadres by twelve in recent years, while the task assignment has not increased. The annual salaries of these additional cadres are enough to repair a locomotive. The big-character poster demanded that factory leaders resolutely streamline the organization. In addition, many employees also raised opinions on issues related to employee welfare.

    Currently, the "Great Blooming and Contending" has reached a climax in these factories in Shenyang that started the rectification movement earlier. In these factories, the democratic life within the working class is unprecedentedly active, and employees are speaking freely. Many people are criticizing leaders with shortcomings by name, fully embodying the master attitude of the working class as masters of their own affairs. Various factories have transferred a group of people to specifically copy and organize the opinions raised by employees. Some work that can be improved immediately is already being improved.

    All other factories in Shenyang City will begin the "Great Blooming and Contending" in October.

### 沈阳六十多个工厂大鸣大放  许多职工对机构臃肿等现象提出批评

    沈阳六十多个工厂大鸣大放
    许多职工对机构臃肿等现象提出批评
    本报讯　拥有五十万产业工人的沈阳市，近一周来已经有六十多个工厂展开了声势浩大的整风和社会主义教育运动。
    职工群众在大鸣大放中，情绪极为高涨。皇姑屯机车客车修理工厂职工，三天就贴出大字报三千五百多张，提出四千五百多条意见。沈阳矿山机器厂三车间统计，平均每个工人贴出的大字报在两张以上。一到午休时间，这个厂几十个代笔处都拥满了写大字报的人群。一群群职工在大字报前面边看边议论；有些被批评的干部，正在认真地记录群众的意见。
    记者最近在一些工厂中采访得到的最深刻的印象是：职工在鸣放中提出的绝大部分意见都是善意的、积极的和正确的；错误的意见所占比重很少。据沈阳矿山机器厂三车间对四百张大字报、一千三百条意见进行分析的结果，其中善意的批评就占90％以上。
    各厂职工在鸣放中提出的批评，涉及的面很广，对领导作风的批评占的比重最大。对厂一级领导干部，群众较多的意见是：开会多，深入少，对群众的疾苦不够关心。对车间一级干部的批评，最多的是命令主义和作风简单粗暴。对工厂生产管理方面的机构臃肿、计划不周、管理紊乱、浪费严重等现象，许多人提出了批评。皇姑屯机车客车修理厂的一张大字报上说：我厂现有的干部足够管理两个同样规模的工厂。我建议中央有关部门考虑将企业中的干部抽调一部分轮流去农村支援农业生产。另一张题为“干部车间”的大字报，批评机车车间这几年任务没有增加，干部却增加了十二名。这些增加的干部每年的工资，即能修理一台机车。大字报要求工厂领导坚决精简机构。另外，对职工生活福利方面的问题，不少职工也提出了意见。
    现在，沈阳这批开始整风较早的工厂已经掀起鸣放的高潮。在这些工厂里，工人阶级内部的民主生活空前活跃，职工们畅所欲言，不少人都指名道姓地批评有缺点的领导人员，充分体现了工人阶级当家作主的主人翁态度。各工厂都抽调了一批人员专门抄录和整理职工提的意见。有些能够马上改进的工作都已在着手改进。
    沈阳市其他工厂将在10月份全部开始大鸣大放。
