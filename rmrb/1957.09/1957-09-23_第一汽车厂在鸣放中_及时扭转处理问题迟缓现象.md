Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, September 22nd: While the First Automobile Works' employees are engaging in vigorous blooming and contending, they are also actively improving their work. As of the 19th, over 1,300 suggestions from just the foundry, engine, and carpentry workshops have been resolved.

The factory's employees raised over 40,000 suggestions during the blooming and contending. Recently, the factory director held two consecutive liaison meetings with workshop directors and section chiefs, criticizing the slow handling of workers' opinions by some leading cadres. He demanded that leaders at all levels must listen to the masses' opinions with humility and sincerity during the workers' blooming and contending and vigorously improve their work. Problems that can be solved must be solved quickly; for problems that cannot be solved, the reasons must be immediately explained to the workers. Currently, based on this requirement, each workshop has begun to form a high tide of handling workers' opinions and improving work.

In the past few days, more people have been copying opinions in front of the big-character posters in each workshop. Factory Director Rao Bin and Deputy Party Secretary Shi Jian have both paid special attention to the opinions raised by workers to them. After the factory director saw the opinions raised by workers to him, he immediately talked with the people who raised the opinions and began to solve them. The leading cadres of the Technical Inspection Department, Labor and Wage Department, Technical Safety Department, Accounting Department, and Cadre Department all take time every day to go to the workshops to copy workers' opinions and collect opinions from the workshop Party organizations, preparing to analyze, summarize, and study solutions.

Workshop directors, Party branch secretaries, work department directors, foremen, etc., in addition to expressing acceptance of criticism on their own big-character posters, also explained the improvements that have already been made. In the past, the sawing section of the processing department of the carpentry workshop often experienced uneven workload due to unreasonable use of labor. After the workers raised their opinions this time, the director of the work department studied with the workers the next day and solved the problem. The workers said, "The leaders solve problems really quickly!"

In order to thoroughly implement the principle of rectifying while correcting, the factory Party committee has conducted an in-depth inspection of the improvement of work. The factory director also holds weekly meetings to check the situation of various deputy factory directors studying and handling workers' opinions.

    第一汽车厂在鸣放中
    及时扭转处理问题迟缓现象
    据新华社长春22日电　第一汽车制造厂在职工大鸣大放的同时，积极改进工作。到19日止，仅铸工、发动机、木工等十个车间，就有一千三百多条意见得到解决。
    这个工厂职工在鸣放中提出四万多条意见。最近厂长连续召开了两次车间主任、处长联系会议，批判了某些领导干部对工人意见处理迟缓的现象，要求各级领导干部在工人大鸣大放中，必需虚心诚恳地倾听群众意见，大力改进工作。凡是可以解决的问题，要迅速解决；不能解决的问题，也要立刻向工人说清原因。目前各车间根据这一要求，已经开始形成一个处理工人意见、改进工作的高潮。
    这几天，在各车间的大字报面前，已经有更多的人在抄录意见。厂长饶斌和党委副书记史坚，都特别重视工人给自己提的意见。厂长看到工人给他提出意见以后，立即同提意见的人谈话，着手解决。技术检查处、劳动工资处、技术安全处、会计处、干部处的领导干部们，每天都抽出时间到车间去抄录工人意见和找车间党组织搜集意见，准备进行分析归纳，研究解决。
    车间主任、党支部书记、工部主任、工长等在自己贴的大字报上，除了表示接受批评以外，还说明已经改进了的情况。木工车间加工部锯加工组，过去因为劳动力使用不合理经常忙闲不均。这次工人提出意见以后，第二天工部主任就同工人研究，解决了这个问题。工人说：“领导解决问题真痛快！”
    为了彻底贯彻边整边改的方针，厂党委对改进工作已经作了深入的检查。厂长也每周开会检查各个分工的厂长研究处理工人意见的情况。
