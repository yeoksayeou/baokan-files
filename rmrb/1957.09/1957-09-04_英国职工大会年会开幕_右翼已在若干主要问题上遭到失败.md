Xinhua News Agency, Blackpool, September 2nd - The British Trades Union Congress (TUC) annual meeting officially opened here this morning.

	TUC Chairman Williamson, in his address, spoke of the high tide of the British workers' movement, with more working days lost due to strikes this year than in any year since 1926. However, he then called on British workers to "maintain peace in industry," emphasizing that both union members and employers must "adopt methods of consultation and negotiation." At the same time, he opposed workers' spontaneous actions to defend their own interests, accusing their self-organized strikes of being "irresponsible."

	Despite the right-wing leaders' continued efforts to urge workers to "maintain peace" with business owners, the right wing's views have already suffered setbacks on several major issues in the behind-the-scenes struggles over key policy decisions at the annual meeting before it officially opened. Secret meetings and informal talks between unions continued throughout the night and into this morning.

	For example, on the important issue of wages, Frank Cousins, General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, will propose a motion condemning the Conservative Party's economic policies, refusing to restrict wages, and affirming the right of workers to take action on an industry-wide basis to ensure that wages keep up with rising prices. This motion will be seconded by Arthur Horner, General Secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers and a Communist. Several other large unions, with a total membership of over three million, including the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the Electrical Trades Union, the National Union of Railwaymen, the Boilermakers' Society, the shipbuilding workers' union, and the municipal workers' union, will support this motion. During secret meetings, the right-wing-controlled municipal workers' union initially attempted to soften the tone of the proposal by "re-evaluating" the wage issue with "reference to changing economic conditions." However, their attempt failed. It is expected that the motion will be passed by an overwhelming majority at the conference on Thursday.

	Regarding the Rent Act, it is reported that the Boilermakers' Society's suggestion in the motion to hold a twenty-four-hour symbolic protest strike was opposed by the General Council. However, the Tobacco Workers' Union put forward an amendment requesting the Congress to ask the Labour Party to abolish the Rent Act after it comes to power, and this amendment has received widespread support. If this amendment can be passed, it will also be a support for the people's struggle against the Act.

	On the issue of nuclear weapons, six medium-sized unions have agreed to put forward a joint proposal requesting the British government to recommend to other governments an immediate and unconditional cessation of testing as the first step towards the prohibition of all nuclear weapons. The right wing attempted to delete the word "unconditional," but this attempt was defeated.

	On the issues of European security, disarmament, and China's representation in the United Nations, it is reported that the General Council does not oppose these motions and is prepared to leave these issues to the Congress to decide.

	Approximately one thousand delegates are participating in the Trades Union Congress, representing eight million three hundred thousand members of one hundred and eighty-four unions.

### 英国职工大会年会开幕  右翼已在若干主要问题上遭到失败

    英国职工大会年会开幕
    右翼已在若干主要问题上遭到失败
    据新华社布莱克浦2日电　英国职工大会年会今天早晨在这里正式开幕。
    职工大会主席威廉逊在致词中谈到英国工人运动的高潮，在今年由于罢工而损失的工作日超过1926年以来的任何年代。但是他接着就要求英国工人“在工业中保持和平”，他强调工会会员同雇主都必须“采用协商和谈判的方式”。同时，他又反对工人自发地保卫自己的利益的行动，指责他们自发地举行的罢工是“不负责任”。
    尽管右翼领导还在竭力呼吁工人同企业主“保持和平”，但是，在大会正式开幕前，对年会上的主要政策决定所作的幕后斗争中，右翼的意见已经在若干主要问题上遭到失败。各工会之间的秘密会议和非正式的会谈彻夜进行，一直继续到今日清晨。
    例如在重要的工资问题上，运输与不熟练工人工会总书记弗兰克·卡曾斯将提出一项提案，谴责保守党的经济政策，拒绝限制工资，肯定工人以产业为单位采取行动的权利，以保证工资能跟上上涨的物价。这项动议将得到全国矿工联盟总书记、共产党人阿瑟·霍尔纳的附议。会员总数在三百万人以上的另外几个大工会，包括机器工人、电气工人、铁路工人、锅炉制造工人、造船工人和市政工人等工会，都将支持这项动议。在秘密会议期间，右翼操纵的市政工人工会起初企图用“参照变化中的经济条件”来“重新估计”工资问题的办法以缓和提案的语气。但是他们的企图失败了。预料这项提案将在星期四的大会上以压倒的多数票通过。
    关于房租法案，据悉锅炉工人工会在动议中提出的举行二十四小时的象征性抗议罢工的建议遭到了最高委员会的反对。但是烟草工人工会提出了一个修正案，要求大会请工党执政后废除房租法案，这项修正案得到广泛的支持。假如这个修正案能够通过，也是对人民反对法案的斗争的一种支持。
    在核武器问题上，六个中型工会同意提出联合提案，要求英国政府向别国政府建议立即无条件停止试验，作为禁止所有核武器的第一步。右翼企图删去“无条件”的字样，但是这种企图被击败了。
    在欧洲安全、裁军和中国在联合国的代表权等问题上，据悉最高委员会不反对这些动议，准备把这些问题交给大会决定。
    参加职工大会的有一千名左右的代表，他们代表一百八十四个工会的八百三十万会员。
