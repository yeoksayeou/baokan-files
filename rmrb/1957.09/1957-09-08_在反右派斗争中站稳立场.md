    Standing Firm in the Anti-Rightist Struggle
    Li Zheren
    I. What is a Standpoint?
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the vanguard of the Chinese working class, our socialist revolution has achieved a decisive victory, the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy is about to be overfulfilled, and the people of the whole country are welcoming the second Five-Year Plan with full confidence.

    Our people's great victory is a great joy for us and for the people of the world, and everyone is cheering for this victory. But the rightists are not like that. Like international reactionaries, they are hostile to our victory. They used the opportunity of rectification to launch a long-planned attack on the leadership of the Party and the socialist system. With extreme malice, they negated all the achievements of the Party and the country, and took a hostile attitude towards the Party and the country on a series of major issues. We say that the people's democratic dictatorship is infinitely superior, and socialism is radiant. The rightists said: "Socialism is pitch black," "Socialism is not as good as capitalism," "There is no democracy in China," and "The socialist system is the root of the three evils." We say that the Communist Party is great, glorious, and correct, and without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be no great victory of the Chinese revolution and the great achievements of socialist construction. The rightists said: "The Communist Party is hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat," "The Communist Party is not as good as the four big families of Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen," "Without the Communist Party, intellectuals would not betray the country." We say that the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements repelled the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie, overcame corruption and waste, eliminated the "five poisons," and created favorable conditions for the peaceful socialist transformation. The rightists said that the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements were "inhuman" and "deeply hurtful." We say that the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries movement further purged counter-revolutionaries, consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, and ensured the smooth progress of socialist transformation and socialist construction. The rightists said that it was "creating terror," "everyone was in danger," it was "bestial barbarism," and it was "the greatest subjectivism." The rightists have no common language with us. They oppose the leadership of the Party and oppose socialism in every way.

    The rightists' hatred for the Party and socialism is by no means accidental, but has its historical and social roots. Among the ninety-four rightists exposed in the Ministry of Foreign Trade, there were twenty-three counter-revolutionaries and those who had counter-revolutionary behavior in history but were not treated as counter-revolutionaries according to the lenient policy, twenty-seven who were struggled against or controlled in the movements of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, three-anti, five-anti, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries because of problems, thirty-two who came from the exploiting class, had long served imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, or whose family members and relatives were struggled against or suppressed in the revolutionary movement, who had always adhered to a reactionary stance, and were dissatisfied with the Party and the government, and seven extreme individualists. The above-mentioned people totaled eighty-nine, accounting for 94% of the total number of rightists. From this, it can be seen what kind of stuff the rightists are, and it is not difficult to understand why they are so reactionary. Therefore, the struggle between us and the rightists is by no means a general difference of understanding, but a fierce struggle between the working class and the bourgeoisie, a life-and-death struggle between two classes, two standpoints, and two roads on the political and ideological fronts. This struggle is not only to struggle against the rightists themselves, but to solve the fundamental issue of whether to take the socialist road or the capitalist road in the ideological field. Therefore, all those who love the Party and love socialism should actively participate in the struggle against the rightists, strictly draw a political and ideological line between themselves and the rightists, thoroughly expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of the rightists, and never let the rightists get away with it.

    From the anti-rightist struggle, it can be seen that for the same issue, there are two completely different views due to different class standpoints. This shows that whether the standpoint is correct is the key to whether the political attitude and political views can be correct, and it is also the key to whether the ideological understanding can be correct.

    Marxism-Leninism tells us that the universe is the unity and struggle of opposites. The history of human society, from slave society to the present, is a history of class struggle. In the struggle of opposites, the opposite side is always the newborn, developing, and promising side; the other side of the opposite is always the decadent, corrupt, and inevitably tending to death. The situation is the same in class struggle. In class society, people always exist as members of a class, and people are all class-based. Abstract, supra-class people do not exist. Standing on the side of that class, one has the thoughts, emotions, and habits of that class, speaks and acts for the interests of that class, and struggles against hostile classes. Landlords and rich peasants exploit peasants. Standing on the standpoint of the working class, we must lead the peasants, form a worker-peasant alliance, carry out land revolution, eliminate feudalism, distribute land, and finally realize cooperativization, and thoroughly liberate agricultural productive forces. Capitalists exploit workers. Standing on the standpoint of the working class, we must carry out socialist revolution, eliminate the bourgeoisie, and realize public ownership of the means of production. Conversely, standing on the standpoint of the landlords and the bourgeoisie, we must suppress the revolutionary movement of workers and peasants. The rightists said: "I am standing on the standpoint of a third party to offer opinions, my motives are good, and I am fair!" Behind these supra-class nonsense lies the reactionary essence of the landlords and the bourgeoisie.

    From this, it can be seen that the so-called standpoint is to be based on that class and serve that class. A person's class standpoint is determined by his class status, first of all by the influence of the family, and also by the influence of the social environment. However, a person's standpoint is not impossible to change. Marx and Engels said in the "Communist Manifesto": "...in the periods when the class struggle nears the decisive hour, the process of dissolution going on within the ruling class, in fact within the whole range of old society, assumes such a violent, glaring character, that a small section of the ruling class cuts itself adrift, and joins the revolutionary class, the class that holds the future in its hands." Therefore, it is very important and necessary to pay attention to people's components, but the theory of only components is wrong. The change of some people's standpoint is due to the change of their original class status. Some people from exploiting-class families, who come into contact with new social forces in social life and accept new influences, can tend to and gradually stand on a progressive and completely correct standpoint with their own efforts. In fact, there are already many people from exploiting-class backgrounds who have accepted ideological transformation under the education of the Party, gradually abandoned their original non-proletarian standpoints, and stood on the proletarian standpoint; there are also many people who are coming over; and there are also many people who intend to come over. Only a small number of die-hard reactionaries are unwilling to come over until they die. Let them take their reactionary standpoints into the coffin.

    II. Why is the Proletarian Standpoint the Most Correct Standpoint?

    The rightists said, "What you think is good, I think is bad, and what you think is bad, I think is good." This tit-for-tat understanding shows that any class uses whether it is beneficial to its own class as the standard for measuring right and wrong. Since this is the case, does objective truth exist? Is it just "this is right, that is right," and there is no objective standard of right and wrong in the world?

    Of course not. Objective standards of right and wrong exist. This depends first of all on which of the mutually opposing classes is the decadent, corrupt, and dying class, and which is the growing, developing, and promising class. The former is the class that hinders the development of productive forces and obstructs the progress of history, while the latter is the class that promotes the development of productive forces and promotes the progress of history. Whether standing on the standpoint of the advanced class is beneficial to the advanced class is the objective standard for measuring right and wrong.

    The proletariat is the class that represents the most advanced productive forces. It is the most advanced, the most far-sighted, and has a great future. In order to liberate itself, the proletariat must liberate all oppressed people, until it liberates all mankind. Because if other oppressed people are not liberated, the proletariat cannot completely liberate itself. The proletariat's great historical mission is to eliminate the system of man exploiting man and establish a new society without exploitation. In terms of fundamental interests, the proletariat and other working people are completely consistent. The proletarian revolution is not only for the benefit of its own class, but also for the benefit of the entire working people. Therefore, standing on the standpoint of the proletariat is precisely standing on the standpoint of the greatest interests of all working people. Therefore, only the proletarian standpoint is the most correct standpoint.

    The rightists said, "Standing on the standpoint of the proletariat will produce class prejudice, hinder the objective observation of problems, and violate objective truth." We say that the class status of the proletariat determines that it is selfless, the most advanced, the most far-sighted, and realistic. Therefore, only by standing on the standpoint of the proletariat can we understand objective truth and adhere to the truth. The more firm the proletarian standpoint is, the stronger the proletarian party spirit is, the more able we are to understand and grasp objective truth, and the more profound and correct the observation of problems. Only the landlords and the bourgeoisie who are accustomed to exploitation will have class prejudices and will not hesitate to distort facts, spread rumors and deceive, and violate objective truth for their own selfish interests.

    The rightists incited the youth, saying, "You should not be blindly obedient," "You should think independently." We believe that independent thinking is class-based. There is independent thinking from the standpoint of the proletariat, and there is independent thinking from the standpoint of the bourgeoisie. We insist on independent thinking from the standpoint of the proletariat and oppose independent thinking from the standpoint of the bourgeoisie. The so-called "independent thinking" of the rightists is to let the masses, especially the youth, leave the proletarian standpoint, not listen to the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League. It is to develop bourgeois liberalism and individualism and expand the ideological market for capitalist restoration. Can we allow them to think independently like this?

    Everyone knows that the Communist Party and the People's Government serve the people wholeheartedly, and we serve the people under the leadership of the Party and the Government. Therefore, we must listen to the Party, resolutely implement the instructions and calls of the Party and the Government, and act in accordance with the policies and guidelines of the Party and the Government. "Blindly obeying" the Party and the Government is precisely a manifestation of the unity of our revolutionary ranks and the faithfulness and firmness of the execution of tasks. What is wrong and bad about such "blind obedience"? Will this hinder people's independent thinking? Absolutely not. On the contrary, only under the leadership of the Party and standing on the proletarian standpoint can we give independent thinking a correct direction and prevent people from getting lost in the storms of class struggle. The Party has always emphasized taking the mass line, which is to promote the enthusiasm of the masses for independent thinking, and to rely on the wisdom of the masses to formulate correct solutions to problems. The Party has always opposed dogmatism divorced from reality, opposed ideological laziness, opposed arbitrariness, blind obedience, and superstition, and advocated hard work and creative labor. Isn't all this allowing people to think independently?

    The rightists also attacked us, saying that when you open your mouth, you want to stand firm on the standpoint of the proletariat, which will "suppress individuality" and "restrict freedom of thought." We believe that in class society, individuality is the specific manifestation of class nature in each person. In old China, the cruel oppression and exploitation of the Chinese people by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism bound the development of individuality and freedom of thought of the Chinese people. What freedom did the oppressed workers, peasants, women, ethnic minorities, and intellectuals have to develop their individuality! The Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people to drive away imperialism, eliminate feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism, and successfully carried out socialist transformation and socialist construction, basically eliminating and will completely eliminate the system of man exploiting man, which fundamentally liberated the individuality of the Chinese people from being bound and suppressed. Please see, since the national liberation, haven't a large number of advanced producers and advanced workers emerged on all fronts of production and construction? In the first half of 1956 alone, 1,111,993 advanced producers and advanced workers were selected in factories and mining enterprises across the country, including 109,150 female workers. On the agricultural production front, Li Shunda, Guo Yuen, Geng Changsuo, Qu Yaoli, Lu Hongbin and tens of thousands of other labor models have emerged. On other fronts, hundreds and thousands of heroic model figures have appeared. Truly, the times create heroes, and every line of work produces top talents! The "individuality" mentioned by the rightists is the individuality of the bourgeoisie, which is the individuality of individualism, liberalism, unearned income, harming others to benefit oneself, being arrogant, indulging in extravagance, and corruption, which is essentially a manifestation of the decadent and decaying characteristics of the bourgeoisie. We firmly oppose the development of this kind of individuality that is harmful to socialism and the collective interests of the vast number of people. We advocate the full development of individuality that is beneficial to socialism and the collective interests of the people in the common life of the people, so that the individuality of individuals and the commonality of the people are coordinated, and the individual interests and collective interests are combined. Only in this way can the individuality of people be infinitely and correctly developed.

    The rightists quibbled, saying: The large-scale class struggle has basically ended, and they are all internal problems of the people. Therefore, there is no need to talk about the difference between the working class standpoint and the bourgeois standpoint. The bourgeoisie no longer has two sides. There is no essential difference between capitalists and workers. Some people even said that capitalists are more advanced than workers. This is obviously a distortion of the facts and is extremely wrong.

    As everyone knows, in the democratic revolution, the bourgeoisie has two sides—revolutionariness and compromise; in the socialist revolution, they have even more two sides—there is a side that can accept socialist transformation, and there is also a side that is nostalgic for capitalist exploitation. Don’t capitalists still have fixed interest? What does fixed interest indicate? It shows that capitalists are still exploiting workers. Under the guise of helping the Party to rectify its style, the rightists blatantly stood on the standpoint of the bourgeoisie and attacked the Party and socialism. Is this because there is no difference between the bourgeoisie and the working class? Of course, we know that transforming the old standpoints and ideological consciousness of bourgeois elements is more difficult and takes more time than transforming the old relations of production. Therefore, we must continue to adhere to ideological transformation of private industrialists and businessmen. This is a long-term and arduous task. The residual influence of the bourgeoisie will exist for a long time, and we must always pay attention to fighting against capitalist ideological tendencies.

    III. How to Change the Non-Proletarian Standpoint and Establish the Proletarian Standpoint?

    Facts have proved that a person's class standpoint can be changed. Since liberation, under the Party's policy of unity, education, and transformation, the ideological transformation of intellectuals has made considerable progress. A part of intellectuals have become communists, and most of them have gradually moved closer to the working class and supported socialism. In various movements and studies, many industrialists and businessmen have also changed some of their old views and expressed their support for the Party's leadership and socialism. However, judging from the ideological situation of most people, there are still varying degrees of significant distance between intellectuals and industrialists and businessmen and the working class's standpoints, viewpoints, thoughts, and feelings. In order to do a good job in socialist construction and thoroughly complete the socialist revolution, industrialists and businessmen and intellectuals need to continue to strengthen ideological transformation, change the old standpoint, and establish the proletarian standpoint. This requires:

    (1) Conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, examine old ideas, destroy old ideas, establish a new ideological system of Marxism-Leninism, understand the laws of social development, and recognize that socialism is the only way for the historical development of human society. Only by believing in the inevitability of taking the socialist road can we firmly support socialism and serve socialism. The purpose of studying theory is to make one's actions revolutionary. However, the purpose of some industrialists and businessmen and intellectuals in studying theory is not this. They have also read some Marxist-Leninist books, but they hold a revisionist attitude, distort Marxism-Leninism, and attack the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, attempting to castrate the revolutionary nature and combat effectiveness of Marxism-Leninism. There are also some industrialists and businessmen and intellectuals who, although they have read some Marxist-Leninist works, do not examine their own thoughts, do not use the viewpoints and methods of Marxism-Leninism to solve practical problems, but adopt a dogmatic attitude, study for the sake of studying, and some even do it to pretend to be active and gain political capital. There is also a type that is fundamentally unwilling to study Marxism-Leninism and even shouts that Marxism-Leninism is outdated. Such erroneous attitudes must be changed in order to carry out self-transformation well.

    (2) Clarify the Standpoint and Distinguish between the Enemy and Ourselves:

    In a society of class struggle, a person who is willing to make progress must stand on the standpoint of the new class that represents the advanced productive forces, and never stand on the standpoint of the decaying class that hinders the development of productive forces. For example, in the socialist revolution, we must stand on the side of the working class and never stand on the side of the bourgeoisie; on the issue of cooperativization, we must stand on the standpoint of the working class, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, oppose and suppress the reactionary activities of landlords and rich peasants; at the same time, we must educate peasants to strengthen collectivist ideology and overcome individualist ideology. We must distinguish clearly who are the enemies and who are our own people. At the present stage, in the period of building socialism, all classes, strata, and social groups that approve, support, and participate in the cause of socialist construction belong to the scope of the people; all social forces and social groups that resist the socialist revolution and are hostile to and undermine socialist construction are enemies of the people. After distinguishing the boundaries between the enemy and ourselves, we must stand on the standpoint of the people to fight against the enemy and eliminate the enemy. In the anti-rightist struggle, we must stand firm, distinguish right from wrong, overcome complacency, thoroughly expose and criticize all the words and actions of the bourgeois rightists, and raise our own awareness.

    (3) Correct the Ideological Method. If the standpoint is correct, we can master the correct ideological method; at the same time, if the method is not correct, it will also affect the standpoint. This requires that when observing and analyzing problems, we must be realistic, oppose subjectivity; we must be comprehensive, oppose one-sidedness; we must be in-depth, oppose superficiality. For example, when studying the issue of agricultural cooperativization, we must have an in-depth understanding of the landlord and rich peasant side, and also an in-depth understanding of the poor peasant, lower-middle peasant, and well-to-do middle peasant side; when inspecting work, we must have an in-depth understanding of the shortcomings side, and also an in-depth understanding of the achievements side. Only by realistically, deeply, and comprehensively understanding the situation of all relevant aspects can we grasp the main contradictions in the work and propose correct solutions that are beneficial to the people and the socialist cause. In order to realistically, deeply, and comprehensively understand the situation, we should take the mass line and go down to investigate and study. However, many rightists, with malice hoping for the failure of the Communist Party, go down to "investigate" with the attitude of specifically looking for shortcomings. Therefore, they only see shortcomings, not achievements, only see darkness, not light, only want to listen to the opinions of the reactionary classes and reactionary strata, and are unwilling to listen to the opinions of the working people. By doing this, they will never be able to understand the problem comprehensively and cannot propose solutions that conform to the interests of socialism. We must oppose this extremely reactionary ideological method of the rightists and learn the method of realistically, comprehensively, and deeply understanding problems.

    (4) We Must Correctly Implement Policies. The various policies of the Party and the government are all concrete manifestations of the general line of the transition period and are formulated from the interests of the broad masses of the people. In order to correctly implement policies, first, we must study and be familiar with policies, and comprehensively understand the spirit and essence of policies; second, we must integrate with the actual situation to implement policies; third, we must examine our own thoughts and actions in the implementation of policies, and examine whether our standpoint is correct, so that when we discover errors and deviations, we can correct them in a timely manner.

    (5) We Must Constantly Carry out Criticism and Self-Criticism. Our criticism and self-criticism are to remove everything that does not conform to the interests of the people and the socialist cause, that is, to remove everything that does not conform to the working class's standpoint, viewpoint, and method, so as to establish and consolidate the working class's standpoint, viewpoint, and method, distinguish between major rights and wrongs, and make all our words and actions conform to the interests of the people and the socialist cause. However, we must be vigilant against the rightists. When they are subjected to the people's counterattack and fall into a state of siege on all sides, they often pretend to self-criticize, even weeping bitterly, attempting to muddle through. For these rightists, we must pursue them to the end, and we will never withdraw until we have won a complete victory.

    在反右派斗争中站稳立场
    李哲人
    一、什么是立场？
    在中国工人阶级的先进部队中国共产党的领导下，我国社会主义革命已经取得了决定性的胜利，发展国民经济的第一个五年计划即将超额完成，全国人民正满怀信心地迎接第二个五年计划。
    我国人民的伟大胜利是我们自己也是全世界人民的一大喜事，大家都为这一胜利而欢欣鼓舞。但是右派分子则不然，他们和国际反动派一样，敌视我们的胜利。他们利用整风的机会，向党的领导和社会主义制度展开了蓄谋已久的进攻。他们怀着极端的恶意，否定党和国家的一切成就，并且在一系列重大问题上同党和国家采取敌对态度。我们说，人民民主专政制度无比优越，社会主义光芒万丈。右派分子则说：“社会主义是漆黑一团”， “社会主义不如资本主义”，“中国没有民主”，“社会主义制度是三害的根源”。我们说，共产党是伟大的光荣的正确的，没有共产党的领导就没有中国革命的伟大胜利和社会主义建设的巨大成就；右派分子则说：“共产党挂羊头卖狗肉”，“共产党还不如蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族”，“没有共产党，知识分子不会卖国”。我们说，“三反”、“五反”运动打退了资产阶级的猖狂进攻，克服了贪污浪费，消灭了“五毒”，树立了廉洁朴素的社会风气，并且为实行社会主义和平改造创造了有利条件；右派分子则说，“三反、五反是惨无人道”，“伤人不可谓不深”。我们说，肃反运动进一步肃清了反革命分子，巩固了人民民主专政，保证了社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业的顺利进行；右派分子则说是“制造恐怖”，“人人自危”，是“兽性的野蛮行径”，是“最大的主观主义”。右派分子同我们毫无共同语言，他们从各个方面来反对党的领导，反对社会主义。
    右派分子仇视党和社会主义，绝不是偶然的，而是有其历史根源和社会根源的。在对外贸易部揭发出来的九十四名右派分子中，有反革命分子和历史上有反革命行为根据宽大政策不以反革命论处的二十三人，因有问题在镇反、三反、五反、肃反等运动中被斗争或被管制的二十七人，出身于剥削阶级、曾长期为帝国主义和国民党反动派服务，或其家属亲友在革命运动中被斗争或被镇压、一贯坚持反动立场、对党和政府不满的分子三十二人，极端个人主义分子七人。以上几种人合计八十九人，占右派分子总数的94％。由此可以看出，右派分子都是些什么货色，也就不难了解他们为什么那样反动。因此，我们同右派分子之间的斗争，绝不是一般的认识分歧，而是工人阶级同资产阶级的一场剧烈斗争，是在政治战线思想战线上两个阶级、两个立场、两条道路的你死我活的斗争。这场斗争不仅是斗争右派本人，而是要在人们思想领域中解决走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的根本问题。因此，所有爱护党、爱护社会主义的人，都应该积极参加对右派分子的斗争，同右派分子严格划清政治思想界限，彻底揭发和批判右派分子的反动言行，绝不让右派分子蒙混过关。
    从反右派的斗争中可以看出，对于同一个问题，由于阶级立场不同，就有两种截然不同的看法。这就说明立场正确与否，是政治态度和政治观点能否正确的关键，也是思想认识能否正确的关键。
    马列主义告诉我们，宇宙是对立物的统一和斗争。人类社会的历史，从奴隶社会迄今，是一部阶级斗争的历史。在对立物的斗争中，对立的一面总是新生的、发展的、有前途的；对立的另一面总是没落的、腐朽的、必然趋向死亡的。在阶级斗争中，情形也是如此。在阶级社会中，人总是作为一个阶级的人而存在的，人都是有阶级性的，抽象的超阶级的人是不存在的。站在那个阶级方面，就有那个阶级的思想、情感和生活习惯，就要为那个阶级的利益说话做事，就要同敌对的阶级进行斗争。地主、富农剥削农民，我们站在工人阶级立场上，就要领导农民，结成工农联盟，进行土地革命，消灭封建，分配土地，并最后实现合作化，彻底解放农业生产力。资本家剥削工人，我们站在工人阶级立场，就要实行社会主义革命，消灭资产阶级，实现生产资料公有制。反之，站在地主资产阶级的立场上，就一定要镇压工人农民的革命运动。右派分子说：“我是站在第三者立场提出意见的呀，我的动机是善良的呀，我是公道的呀！”在这些超阶级的胡说后面，正隐藏着地主、资产阶级的反动本质。
    这样看来，所谓立场就是立足于那个阶级，为那个阶级服务。一个人的阶级立场，是受他所属的阶级地位决定的，首先是受到家庭的影响，同时也受到社会环境的影响。但是，一个人的立场并不是不可能改变的。马克思、恩格斯在“共产党宣言”里说过：“……在阶级斗争接近决战的那些时期，统治阶级内部，整个旧社会内部瓦解的过程便来得非常强烈，非常尖锐，致使统治阶级中有一小部分人脱离出去而归附于革命阶级，即归附于未来主人翁的阶级。”因此，注意人们的成份是十分重要的、应该的，但唯成份论是不对的。有些人的立场改变是由于原来的阶级地位发生变化；有些出身剥削阶级家庭的人，在社会生活中接触到新生的社会力量，接受了新的影响，加上自己的努力，是可以趋向并且逐步站到进步的和完全正确的立场上。事实上已经有不少剥削阶级出身的人，在党的教育下，接受了思想改造，逐步抛弃了原有的非无产阶级立场，站到无产阶级立场上来了；正在过来的人也很多；打算过来的也不乏其人。只有为数不多的死硬的反动分子，是死也不肯过来的，那就让他们把他们的反动立场带进棺材去吧。
    二、为什么无产阶级立场是最正确的立场？
    右派分子说，“你们认为好的，我就认为是坏的，你们认为坏的，我就认为是好的”。这种针锋相对的认识，正说明任何一个阶级都以对本阶级是否有利作为衡量是非好坏的标准。既然这样，那么客观真理是否存在呢？是否就是“此亦一是非，彼亦一是非”，天下就没有客观的是非标准呢？
    当然不是。客观的是非标准是存在的。这首先看在互相对立的阶级中，哪一个是没落的、腐朽的和走向衰亡的阶级，哪一个是正在生长着、发展着和有远大将来的阶级。前者是障碍生产力发展、阻挠历史前进的阶级，后者则是推动生产力向前发展、推动历史前进的阶级。是否站在先进阶级的立场上，对先进阶级是否有利，就是衡量是非的客观标准。
    无产阶级是代表最先进生产力的阶级，它最先进、最有远见，它有伟大的将来。无产阶级为了解放自己，它必须解放一切被压迫人民，直至解放全人类。因为其他被压迫人民不解放，无产阶级便不能彻底解放自己。无产阶级的伟大的历史使命就是消灭人剥削人的制度，建立没有人剥削人的新社会。在根本利益上，无产阶级和别的劳动人民是完全一致的。无产阶级革命不仅为了本阶级利益，也是为了整个劳动人民利益。因此，站在无产阶级的立场上，正是站在全体劳动人民的最大利益的立场上。因此，只有无产阶级立场，才是最正确的立场。
    右派分子说：“站在无产阶级立场上，就会产生阶级偏见，就会妨碍客观地观察问题，就会违背客观真理。”我们说，无产阶级的阶级地位决定它是大公无私的、最先进的、最有远见的、实事求是的；因此只有站在无产阶级立场上，才能认识客观真理，才能坚持真理。无产阶级立场越坚定，无产阶级的党性越强，就越能认识和掌握客观真理，对问题的观察越能深刻和正确。只有剥削成性的地主资产阶级才会抱有阶级偏见，才会为了自己的私利不惜歪曲事实，造谣欺骗，违背客观真理。
    右派分子煽动青年说，“你们不应该唯唯诺诺”，“你们应该独立思考”。我们认为：独立思考是有阶级性的，有站在无产阶级立场上的独立思考，有站在资产阶级立场上的独立思考。我们坚持站在无产阶级立场上去独立思考，反对站在资产阶级立场上的独立思考。右派分子的所谓“独立思考”，是让群众特别是让青年离开无产阶级立场，不听共产党和共青团的话，就是要发展资产阶级自由主义、个人主义，为资本主义复辟开扩思想市场。难道我们能够容许他们这样独立思考吗？
    大家都知道，共产党、人民政府是全心全意为人民服务的，我们是在党和政府领导下为人民服务的。因此，我们一定要听党的话，坚决执行党和政府的指示和号召，按照党和政府的政策方针办事。对党和政府“唯唯诺诺”，正是我们革命队伍的一致性和执行任务的忠实性与坚决性的表现。这样的“唯唯诺诺”有何不对，有何不好呢？这样会妨碍人们的独立思考吗？绝对不会。相反地，只有在党的领导下和站在无产阶级立场上，才能给独立思考以正确的方向，才能使人们在阶级斗争的风浪中不致迷失路途。党历来强调要走群众路线，就是要发扬群众独立思考的积极性，就是要依靠群众的智慧来制定解决问题的正确方案。党历来都反对脱离实际的教条主义，反对思想懒惰，反对武断、盲从和迷信，提倡刻苦钻研，提倡创造性的劳动。这一切难道不是让人们充分地独立思考么？
    右派分子还攻击我们说，你们一开口就是要站稳无产阶级的立场，这样就会“压制个性”，“限制思想自由”。我们认为：在阶级社会中，个性就是阶级性在每个人身上的具体表现。在旧中国，帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义对中国人民的残酷压迫和剥削，束缚了中国人民的个性发展和思想自由。被压迫的工人、农民、妇女、少数民族、知识分子有何自由发展个性之可言！中国共产党领导中国人民打走了帝国主义，消灭了封建主义和官僚资本主义，并且胜利地进行了社会主义改造和社会主义建设，基本上消灭了并且将要彻底消灭人剥削人的制度，这就从根本上把中国人民的个性从被束缚被压制的状态下解放了。请看，全国解放以来，在生产建设的各个战线上不是已涌现出大量的先进生产者和先进工作者吗？仅仅1956年上半年，全国各厂矿企业评选出来的先进生产者、先进工作者就有一百一十一万一千九百九十三人，其中女职工有十万九千一百五十人。在农业生产战线上李顺达、郭玉恩、耿长锁、曲耀离、吕鸿宾千千万万的劳动模范涌现出来。在别的战线上，都出现了数以千百计的英雄模范人物。真是时势造英雄，行行出状元！右派分子所说的“个性”，乃是资产阶级的个性，是个人主义、自由主义、不劳而获、损人利己、唯我独尊、花天酒地、腐化堕落的个性，实质上是资产阶级没落的腐朽的特性表现。我们坚决反对发展这种有害社会主义、有害广大人民集体利益的个性。我们主张在人民的共同生活中充分发展有利于社会主义和人民集体利益的个性，使得个人的个性和人民群众的共性协调起来，把个人利益和集体利益结合起来。只有这样，人们的个性才能得到无限的正确的发展。
    右派分子狡辩说：现在大规模的阶级斗争基本结束了，都是人民的内部问题了，因此，不必再谈什么工人阶级立场和资产阶级立场的区别了，资产阶级已经没有两面性了，资本家和工人没有本质上的区别了；有人甚至说资本家比工人还进步了。这显然是歪曲事实，是极端错误的。
    大家知道，在民主革命中，资产阶级是有两面性的——革命性和妥协性；在社会主义革命中，它们更有两面性——有可以接受社会主义改造的一面，也有留恋资本主义剥削的一面。资本家不是还有定息吗？定息说明什么呢？它说明：资本家还在剥削工人。在帮助党整风的幌子下，右派分子不是明目张胆地站在资产阶级的立场上向党和社会主义进攻吗？这难道是资产阶级和工人阶级没有区别了吗？当然我们知道，改造资产阶级分子的旧立场和思想意识，比改造旧的生产关系更困难，更需要时间。因此必须继续坚持对私营工商业者进行思想改造，这是一个长期的艰巨的工作。资产阶级的残余影响将要长期存在，我们必须经常注意同资本主义思想倾向作斗争。
    三、如何改变非无产阶级的立场，树立无产阶级的立场？
    事实证明：一个人的阶级立场是可以改变的。解放以来，在党的团结、教育、改造的政策下，知识分子的思想改造有了不小的成绩；一部分知识分子已经成了共产主义者，大多数也逐渐靠拢工人阶级和拥护社会主义。在各种运动和学习中，许多工商业者也改变了自己的某些旧的观点，表示拥护党的领导和社会主义。但是，从大多数人的思想情况来看，知识分子和工商业者同工人阶级的立场、观点、思想、感情，还有不同程度的不小的距离。为了搞好社会主义建设和彻底完成社会主义革命，工商业者和知识分子需要继续加强思想改造，改变旧立场，树立无产阶级立场。这就必须：
    （一）认真学习马列主义和毛主席的著作，检查旧思想，破坏旧思想，树立马列主义的新的思想体系，认识社会发展规律，认清社会主义是人类社会历史发展的必由之路。只有相信走社会主义道路的必然性，才能坚定地拥护社会主义和为社会主义服务。学习理论的目的是为了使自己的行动能够革命化。但是，有些工商业者和知识分子学习理论的目的，并不是这样。他们也看了一些马列主义的书籍，但却抱着修正主义的态度，曲解马列主义，攻击马列主义的基本原则，企图阉割马列主义的革命性和战斗性。还有些工商业者和知识分子虽然读了一些马列主义的著作，但是他们不检查自己的思想，不是为了使用马列主义的观点方法去解决实际问题，而是采取教条主义的态度，为学习而学习，其中有些甚至是为了假装积极，捞取政治资本。还有一种，根本就不愿学习马列主义，而且高喊马列主义已经过时。有这种错误的态度必须改变，才能很好地进行自我改造。
    （二）明确立场、分清敌我：
    处在阶级斗争的社会中，一个愿意进步的人一定要站在代表先进生产力的新生的阶级的立场上，绝不要站在阻碍生产力发展的腐朽的阶级的立场上。例如，在社会主义革命中，一定要站在工人阶级的方面，绝不要站在资产阶级方面；在合作化问题上，一定要站在工人阶级的立场上，巩固工农联盟，反对和镇压地主富农的反动活动；同时也教育农民加强集体主义思想，克服个人主义思想。我们一定要分清楚那些人是敌人，那些人是自己人。在现阶段，在建设社会主义的时期，一切赞成、拥护和参加社会主义建设事业的阶级、阶层和社会集团，都属于人民的范围；一切反抗社会主义革命和敌视、破坏社会主义建设的社会势力和社会集团，都是人民的敌人。分清了敌我界限之后，就要站在人民的立场上对敌斗争，消灭敌人。在反右派斗争中，就要站稳立场，明辨是非，克服温情主义，彻底揭发和批判资产阶级右派分子的一切言论和行动，提高自己的觉悟。
    （三）端正思想方法。立场站得正确，才能掌握正确的思想方法；同时，方法不正确，也影响立场。这就要求在观察问题、分析问题时，必须实事求是，反对主观性；必须全面，反对片面性；必须深入，反对表面性。例如，在研究农业合作化问题时，要深入了解地主、富农一方，也要深入了解贫农、下中农和富裕中农一方；去检查工作时，要深入了解缺点一方，也要深入了解成绩一方。只有实事求是地深入、全面地了解各有关方面的情况，才能抓住工作中的主要矛盾，提出有利于人民和社会主义事业的正确办法。为了实事求是地深入全面了解情况，应当走群众路线，下去调查研究。但是，许多右派分子怀着希望共产党失败的恶意，抱着专找缺点的态度下去“调查”，所以他们只看到缺点，看不到成绩，只看到黑暗，看不到光明，只愿意听反动阶级和反动阶层分子的舆论，不愿意听劳动人民的舆论。他们这样作法，一辈子也不能了解问题全面，提不出符合社会主义利益的办法。我们必须反对右派分子这种极端反动的思想方法，学习实事求是、全面、深入了解问题的方法。
    （四）必须正确执行政策。党和政府的各种政策，都是过渡时期总路线的具体化，是从广大人民的利益出发来制定的。为了正确执行政策，第一，必须研究和熟悉政策，全面了解政策的精神和实质；第二，必须结合实际情况去贯彻执行政策；第三，必须在政策执行中检查自己的思想行动，考察自己的立场是否正确，以便发现错误和偏差时加以及时纠正。
    （五）必须经常地进行批评和自我批评。我们的批评和自我批评，是为了去掉一切不符合人民和社会主义事业利益的东西，也就是要去掉不符合于工人阶级立场、观点、方法的东西，以便树立和巩固工人阶级的立场、观点和方法，分清大是大非，使自己的一切言论和行动符合于人民和社会主义事业的利益。但对右派分子必须提高警惕，他们在遭受到人民的反击，陷入四面楚歌时，往往假装自我批评，甚至痛哭流涕，企图蒙混过关。对于这些右派分子，我们一定要追击到底，不获全胜，绝不收兵。
