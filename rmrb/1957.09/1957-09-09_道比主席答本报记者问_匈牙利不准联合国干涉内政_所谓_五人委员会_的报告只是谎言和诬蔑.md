Our Newspaper, Budapest, 8th Dispatch: The Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, Dobi, received a reporter from this newspaper in Budapest on the 6th. Comrade Dobi answered questions raised by the reporter regarding the United Nations convening a special meeting to discuss the so-called "Five-Person Committee" report.

Question: Could you please tell us, Comrade Chairman, what is the purpose of the United Nations convening this special meeting and rehashing the so-called "Hungarian question"?

Answer: Western imperialism has long been engaged in subversive activities in Hungary. The October incident was something they had prepared long ago, but their conspiracy failed. Naturally, they are very angry and produced a report by a "Five-Person Committee," hoping to undermine the prestige of the socialist camp in the eyes of the people of the world, first and foremost to slander the Soviet Union, and at the same time, to continue creating chaos among the Hungarian people. This new offensive against us certainly has other purposes as well, namely to use the "Hungarian question" to divert the attention of the people of the world from the issue of disarmament and from the imperialist aggression in the Middle East and Africa.

As for the current situation of our people, they are seeing the truth more and more clearly. Our people unanimously protest this approach by the United Nations, considering it a rude interference in the internal affairs of the Hungarian people. Protest rallies are being held throughout the country, and writers are also condemning this action by the United Nations. Some writers, whom we initially thought would not express their attitude on this matter—and of course, we cannot force them to do so—have also signed the protest letter.

Many people who were deceived during the counter-revolutionary period and fled abroad, especially some children, have written letters home to their relatives, complaining and asking to return home, but they have been blocked by the governments of the countries where they are staying. This matter has also aroused public anger. The United Nations should be discussing these kinds of issues. Furthermore, during the counter-revolutionary period, many people suffered mental trauma, and now they all hate the counter-revolution. The imperialists' assessment of the Hungarian people's sentiment is far behind the objective situation. Therefore, the purpose of their offensive this time will not be achieved.

Question: How was the so-called United Nations "Five-Person Committee" report put together?

Answer: According to their own explanation, the report was compiled based on oral materials from people who fled during the October incident. The main witnesses were Anna Kéthly, a right-wing Social Democrat; Szélagyi Király, a military leader during the counter-revolutionary period; and József Csuhango, a right-wing member of the Smallholders Party. As you know, these people were previously convicted and imprisoned in Hungary for engaging in activities against the people's democratic system and for espionage and treason. One can imagine that the report produced by the "Five-Person Committee" based on the materials provided by these people can only be a pack of lies and slander.

Question: We have seen with our own eyes that the Hungarian working people are increasingly closely united around the Kádár government, but the "Five-Person Committee" report slanders the Kádár government as illegal and claims that the Nagy government is still valid. From a legal point of view, can this claim be justified?

Answer: You can see from the mass activities of this year's May Day and August Constitution Day that the working people of Hungary support the workers' and peasants' revolutionary government. Indeed, we are able to unite the working people so closely today.

As for the legal point of view, the Kádár government is completely legal. Its appointment was signed by me and the Secretary-General of the Parliament on behalf of the Presidium of the Parliament after discussions by the Presidium of the Parliament and relevant personnel of the National Assembly.

The Nagy government was also appointed by the Presidium of the Parliament. When Nagy's betrayal was publicly exposed, the Presidium of the Parliament considered the appointment of the new government. On the morning of November 4th last year, Nagy automatically abandoned his post and ran to a foreign embassy, which showed the world that he had abandoned his responsibilities. Subsequently, the Presidium of the People's Republic officially dismissed him. The traitorous elements of the Nagy clique are today despised by the entire nation. Kádár took over the leadership of the government in a time of crisis, saved the socialist system, and defended the achievements of the past twelve years and the peace of the people.

Question: Just now, Comrade Chairman, you mentioned that Western imperialism wants to attack the Soviet Union through the "Hungarian question." How does Comrade Chairman evaluate the Soviet Union's assistance to Hungary last October and after October?

Answer: Without the help of the Soviet Union, we could not have saved the working people and the people's democratic system. This is primarily because unprecedented traitors appeared in our highest leadership. The anti-national and anti-Party rebellion of the Nagy group betrayed the people's regime; at the same time, as everyone knows, Western imperialism instigated this restoration, and they vigorously supported our domestic enemies militarily, materially, and spiritually. In such a situation, it is not enough to rely solely on our internal progressive forces to defend the people's democratic system. In 1919, we failed once under the united intervention of the international bourgeoisie. In 1956, they wanted to unite again to destroy our regime, but they failed. Because now we also have the unity of the international proletariat, and this unity is specifically embodied in the Warsaw Pact. When resisting attacks from domestic or foreign enemies, we can request the help of the Soviet Union and other signatory countries in accordance with the Warsaw Pact.

After defeating the counter-revolution, we received comprehensive and selfless assistance from the Soviet Union and fraternal countries. The fact that our situation has been able to recover and consolidate so quickly is primarily due to the assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries of the socialist camp. This kind of unity is unprecedented in the world. Now we are stable. Every sensible person clearly recognizes this, and those of us who have experienced it firsthand feel it even more deeply.

Here, I would also like to especially thank the Chinese comrades for their help. Comrade Zhou Enlai's visit gave us great support.

Finally, Chairman Dobi talked about some of his past experiences. He said that he had participated in the work of the Social Democratic Party and the Smallholders Party, and had fought against right-leaning leaders within the Social Democratic Party. In 1935, he was elected as a member of parliament as a candidate of the Smallholders Party. He worked with a firm will for the unity of the three million poor peasants, farm laborers, and small farmers. During World War II, he organized the Hungarian Peasant Alliance.

In 1947, when Ferenc Nagy, the right-wing leader of the Smallholders Party, fled abroad, he took over the leadership of the Smallholders Party. In this way, the left-wing forces played a leading role in the Smallholders Party. The left-wing Smallholders Party achieved close cooperation with the Communist Party through the People's Front organization. Comrade Dobi has served as the Chairman of the Presidium of the Republic since 1952. During the six weeks of the counter-revolutionary period last October, until the counter-revolution was crushed, he stayed at his post day and night and never left the Parliament Building. As the Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, he has made contributions in the struggle to defend Hungary's people's democratic system and defend the Constitution of the People's Republic.

    道比主席答本报记者问
    匈牙利不准联合国干涉内政
    所谓“五人委员会”的报告只是谎言和诬蔑
    本报布达佩斯8日电　匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席道比6日接见了本报驻布达佩斯记者，道比同志就联合国召开特别会议讨论所谓“五人委员会”的报告，回答了本报记者提出的问题。
    问：请主席同志谈一谈，联合国召开这次特别会议，重新搬出所谓“匈牙利问题”，它的目的何在？
    答：西方帝国主义长期以来在匈牙利搞颠覆活动，十月事件是他们早就准备了的，可是他们的阴谋失败了。他们当然很生气，搞出了一个“五人委员会”的报告，想在全世界人民面前破坏社会主义阵营的威信，首先是要污蔑苏联，同时还想在匈牙利人民中间继续制造混乱。这次对我们发动新进攻，当然还有别的目的，就是想用“匈牙利问题”来转移世界人民对裁军问题、对帝国主义在中东和非洲进行侵略活动的注意力。
    至于我国人民目前的情况是，越来越清楚地看到了事实的真相。我国人民一致地抗议联合国的这种做法，认为这是对匈牙利人民内政的粗暴干涉。全国各地都在召开抗议大会，作家们也谴责联合国这种行动。有一些作家，我们起初以为他们是不会对这件事表示态度的，我们当然也不能强迫他们这样做。但是他们也在抗议书上签名了。
    许多反革命时期受骗逃往国外的人，特别是一些孩子，他们写信回国，向亲人诉苦，要求回家，但是遭到了所在国政府的阻挠。这件事也激起了公愤。联合国理应谈谈这类问题。还有，在反革命时期，许多人受到心灵上的创伤，现在他们都痛恨反革命。帝国主义者对匈牙利人民情绪的估计，已远远落在客观情况的后面。因此他们这次进攻的目的是不会达到的。
    问：所谓联合国“五人委员会”的报告是怎样凑成的？
    答：据他们自己的说明，报告是根据十月事件时逃出的人的口述材料而编成的，主要见证人是社会民主党右派安娜·凯特利、反革命时期的军事领导谢拉·基拉伊和小农党的右派分子约瑟夫·丘凡戈。你知道，这些人过去在匈牙利因为从事反人民民主制度的活动和间谍叛国行为，被判过罪坐过牢。人们可以想见，在这些人提供材料的基础上所作出的“五人委员会”的报告，只能是一片谎言和污蔑。
    问：我们在这里亲眼看到匈牙利劳动人民是日益紧密地团结在卡达尔政府的周围，而“五人委员会”的报告中却污蔑卡达尔政府是非法的，说纳吉政府仍然有效；从法律观点来看，这种说法能是有根据的吗？
    答：你们从今年五一劳动节和八月宪法节的群众活动中，可以看到，匈牙利的劳动人民是支持工农革命政府的。的确，我们今天能这样紧密地把劳动人民团结在一起。
    至于从法律观点来说，卡达尔政府完全是合法的。它的任命是议会主席团和国会有关人员经过讨论后由我和议会秘书长代表议会主席团签字的。
    纳吉政府也经过议会主席团的任命，当纳吉的出卖已公开暴露时，议会主席团已考虑了新政府的任命。去年11月4日早晨，纳吉自动抛开了他的岗位，跑到外国使馆去，这就向全世界表明，他已放弃了自己的职责。此后，人民共和国主席团正式予以撤职。纳吉之流的叛国分子今天已为全国人民所唾弃。卡达尔在危急之时担负起政府的领导，拯救了社会主义制度，保卫了过去十二年的成就和人民的和平。
    问：刚才主席同志谈到西方帝国主义想通过“匈牙利问题”对苏联进行攻击，主席同志怎样估价苏联在去年10月和10月以后对匈牙利的帮助？
    答：没有苏联的帮助，我们不可能拯救劳动人民和人民民主制度。这首先是因为，在我们的最高领导中出现了前所未有的叛徒。纳吉集团的反国反党的叛变出卖了人民政权；同时大家知道，西方帝国主义策动这个复辟，他们在军事上物质上精神上大力支援我们国内的敌人，在这样的情况下，仅靠我们内部的进步力量是不够保卫人民民主制度的。1919年在国际资产阶级联合的干涉之下，我们失败了一次，1956年，他们又想联合起来摧毁我们的政权，但是他们失败了。因为现在我们也有国际无产阶级的联合，而且这种联合已具体地体现在华沙条约中，在抵抗国内或国外敌人的进攻时，我们都可以根据华沙条约请求苏联和其他缔约国的帮助。
    在打垮反革命之后，我们又得到了苏联和各兄弟国家的全面和无私的帮助，我国情况能够得到这样迅速的恢复和巩固，首先应归功于苏联和社会主义阵营各人民民主国家的援助。这种团结是世界上没有先例的。现在我们是稳定了。每一个有头脑的人，都清楚地认识到这一点，而我们亲历其境的人体会就更深了。
    在这里，我也要特别感谢中国同志给于我们的帮助。周恩来同志的访问给了我们很大的支持。
    最后，道比主席谈到了自己一些过去的经历。他说他曾经参加过社会民主党和小农党的工作，在社会民主党内和右倾领导分子进行过斗争。1935年作为小农党的候选人被选为国会议员。他以坚定的意志为三百万贫雇农和小农的团结而努力。第二次世界大战时，组织过匈牙利农民联盟。
    1947年当小农党右派领导费伦茨·纳吉逃往外国时，他就担负起小农党的领导工作。这样，左派力量在小农党中就起领导作用。左派小农党通过人民阵线组织和共产党取得紧密合作。道比同志自1952年起一直担任共和国主席团主席，在去年十月反革命时期一直到反革命被粉碎的六个星期中，日夜坚守自己岗位，未离开过国会大厦一步。作为匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席，他在保卫匈牙利的人民民主制度、保卫人民共和国宪法的斗争中，作出了贡献。
