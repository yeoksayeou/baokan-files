Selection of Works by Great Calligraphers of the Ming and Qing Dynasties Exhibited in Beihai Park, Beijing

　　(Our report) The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture's Relics Investigation and Research Group has presented three batches of selected Ming and Qing Dynasty calligraphy and paintings at the Capital History and Construction Museum in the Tianwang Hall of Beihai Park.

　　The first batch, exhibited in early April, comprised over eighty works, roughly half paintings and half calligraphy. The authors ranged from the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty to the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, spanning about five hundred years. Among them were exquisite and rare works such as Yao Gongshou's bamboo and rocks, Xia Yan's running script long scroll, Wu Mojing's inscription on the landscape of Monk Shanchou, Yun Nantian's inscription on Wang Shigu's Summer Cold Painting, Jiao Bingzhen's portrait of Zhang Detian, and Gu Taiqing's Apricot Blossom Painting.

　　In early July, the second batch of exhibits was replaced, equal in number to the previous batch, but entirely paintings. Among them, Hua Guan's portrait demonstrated the traditional art of realistic figure painting in Chinese painting; Yuan Yao's landscape employed shading and perspective entirely in the Western style; Wang Shigu's three landscape paintings showcased the characteristics of his achievements in different periods. At this exhibition, brief introductions were also provided about the biographies of these artists. As of September 1, the number of visitors had exceeded 140,000.

　　The third batch, exhibited on September 2, consisted entirely of calligraphy, including hand scrolls, albums, hanging scrolls, and couplets, totaling about two hundred pieces. Among them, Xu Wei's (Qingteng) cursive script couplet from the Ming Dynasty displayed a free and unrestrained style, unconstrained by conventions. Mao Qizong's cursive script long couplet exhibited bold brushwork and soaring momentum. Ni Yuanlu's cursive script long couplet stood out for its vigorous and elegant strength (note that very few couplets by Ming Dynasty calligraphers have been passed down). The hanging scrolls included Wu Kuan's running-regular script and Wen Zhengming's cursive script, deeply imbued with the essence of Su and Wang. There was also Shi Kefa's running cursive script, powerful, rounded, and rare in the world. Fu Shan's running cursive script from the Qing Dynasty was fluid and natural. Zheng Fu's (Gukou) cursive clerical script, blended the spirit of cursive and clerical scripts, with an antique and varied style. Chen Jieqi's regular script was dignified and upright, shedding the atmosphere of the "academy style." All of the above are invaluable authentic works. (Zhu Xintao)

　　明清大书法家选品
　　在北京北海公园内展出
    本报讯  北京市文化局文物调查研究组在北海公园内天王殿首都历史与建设博物馆展出的明、清书画选品，已有三批。
    4月初展出的第一批计八十多幅，书画参半。作者上起明永乐，下至清光绪，约五百年。其中如姚公绶的竹石、夏言的行书长卷、吴墨井题山畴和尚的山水、恽南田题王石谷的夏寒图、焦秉贞画张得天肖像、顾太清的文杏图等都是精湛而少见的作品。
    7月初换了第二批展品，数量和上批相等，但全部是画。其中华冠的人像表现了国画写真的传统艺术；袁耀的山水，明暗向背，全同西法；王石谷的三幅山水，表现了不同时期的成就特点。这次展览会上并对这些作家的简历作了简要介绍。截至9月1日止，参观人数已有十四万余人次。
    第三批于9月2日展出，全部是书法，计有手卷、册页、条幅、楹联等约二百件。其中明代人徐渭（青藤）的草书联，笔致洒脱，不拘成规。冒起宗的草书长联，用笔豪放，气势飞腾。倪元璐的草书长联则以遒劲秀挺见胜（按明代书家楹联传世者绝少）。条幅有吴宽的行楷和文澂明的草书深得苏、王神髓。还有史可法的行草，苍劲圆润，世所罕见。清代人傅山的行草，流畅自如。郑簠（谷口）的草隶，融化分草隶精神，古拙多姿。陈介祺的楷书，端庄平整，脱去馆阁气息。以上均为不可多得的真迹。  （朱欣陶）
