　　“August in Lanzhou, the city is filled with the fragrance of melons.” Lanzhou has historically been known as the "City of Fruits and Melons." In August 1957, the melon fragrance in Lanzhou was even more intense than in previous years, but the so-called "City of Fruits and Melons" has already been replaced by the "City of Industry."

　　Before me are several figures that mark Lanzhou's transformation from ancient to new, from consumption to production, and the growth of modern industry from small to large. In 1949, Lanzhou had only fifteen factories and mines; by 1957, this had increased to over one hundred. The total industrial output value in 1956 increased by 36.72 times compared to 1949. The total investment in capital construction in 1956 increased by 45.56 times compared to 1949. The total number of employees in the city in 1956 increased by 14.63 times compared to 1949. Labor productivity in 1956 increased by 1.23 times compared to 1949. By the end of the year, the urban construction area of Lanzhou will expand to about three times the area of the old city in 1949.

　　Lanzhou's industry has been built from a very weak foundation. In this construction site stretching sixty kilometers from east to west, with its ever-changing scenery, some things from the Middle Ages still remain. The contrast between the old and the new is particularly stark and even more exciting. At the foot of the ancient Great Wall, large-scale factories are springing up like mushrooms after rain. The dilapidated walls of the Great Wall happen to be part of their factory boundary walls. Compared to these modern factories, the Great Wall is even less noticeable. Lanzhou is an industrial city with petroleum, machinery, and chemical industries as its backbone. The area of the oil refinery is larger than the old urban area of Lanzhou. The dense network of pipelines buried beneath it, if connected end to end, would be as long as the distance from Xi'an to Lanzhou. Now, the silvery, massive oil storage tank clusters have been installed. The thermal cracking refining unit has already taken shape. The intricate steel structure of the heating furnace frame has also been erected. The furnace construction is proceeding intensely. The installation of the plant's largest K5 tower is nearing completion. Soon, this plant will partially go into production. At that time, crude oil from the Jiuquan Basin, Qaidam Basin, and Karamay will be refined here, ending the history of transporting crude oil from Yumen Oilfield, which began in 1938, to the east of the country. A modern factory specializing in the production of petroleum machinery broke ground a month ago. Before liberation, Lanzhou had only a 500 kW power plant. Now, the Lanzhou Thermal Power Plant, which is equivalent in size to hundreds of old Lanzhou power plants, has been basically completed. High-voltage transmission towers from here to Baiyin City and other nearby industrial areas have been erected. A modern water plant will begin supplying water to the Lanzhou Thermal Power Plant within the year. Now, several major projects have been completed long ago, and the pressure water transmission main pipe, which is one "hua li" long, will soon be connected to the thermal power plant's gravity flow ditch. Lanzhou has developed into a city with a population of 680,000.

　　Lanzhou is a strip-shaped city composed of nine river valley plains. It leans against Gaolan Mountain in the south and faces North Pagoda Mountain in the north. The mighty Yellow River, like a giant golden satin ribbon, passes through the city from west to east. Looking at the layout of the entire city, people praise it as the "Stalingrad of the East." At dusk, citizens like to stroll along the Yellow River, admiring the magnificent scenery of the setting sun over the long river, and gazing at the sail-less, oarless sheepskin rafts, safely drifting eastward amidst the turbulent waves. The Yellow River adds a lot of charm to Lanzhou's cityscape, but it also adds some difficulties to the city's transportation. Years ago, textbooks said: Lanzhou has a Yellow River Iron Bridge, referring to the "First Bridge of the Yellow River in the World" built by the German company Tailai Foreign Firm during the Guangxu and Xuantong periods of the Qing Dynasty using discarded steel beams. It cannot meet the needs of Lanzhou's industrial construction today. Therefore, after liberation, bridge construction became an important part of Lanzhou's urban construction. Now, two rainbow-like bridges have appeared at the eastern and western ends of Lanzhou—the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway Bridge and the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Bridge. The bridge-building army is busy constructing Lanzhou's fifth bridge—the Qilihe Yellow River Highway Bridge. This is a bridge that can accommodate four cars side-by-side, with sidewalks six meters wide on both sides. Now, piers No. 1, 4, 5, and 6 of the bridge, as well as the north and south abutments, have all been completed, and piers No. 2 and 3 are also gradually rising.

　　Lanzhou will become a railway transportation center. The 348-kilometer-long Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway was officially opened to traffic as early as October 1952. Now, there are more than 1,700 kilometers of railway in Gansu Province. With Lanzhou as the center, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has crossed the Gobi Desert and extended west to Yumen; the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway has crossed the Yellow River and extended northward to the Tengger Desert. Preliminary surveying for the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway has begun; the new line from Lanzhou to Sichuan is also being surveyed. The railway hub station in the western suburbs of Lanzhou will become one of the largest railway hub stations in the country. Dozens of tracks crisscross, and several thousand trains can be assembled day and night.

    新兰州的脚步
    本报记者　柳梆
    “8月兰州，满城瓜香”。兰州在历史上就是以“瓜果之城”闻名的。1957年8月的兰州，虽然瓜香比往年更为浓郁，但是，所谓“瓜果之城”已经为“工业之城”所代替了。
    我面前摆着几个标志着兰州从古老转向新生、从消费转向生产、现代工业从小到大的数字。1949年兰州全市只有十五个厂矿，1957年增加到一百多个；工业生产总值1956年较1949年增加了三十六点七二倍；基本建设总投资1956年较1949年增加四十五点五六倍；全市职工人数1956年较1949年增加十四点六三倍；工人的劳动生产率1956年较1949年增加一点二三倍；到年底，兰州市的城市建筑面积将比1949年的旧城面积扩大三倍左右。
    兰州的工业是从十分薄弱的基础上建设起来的。在这从东到西迤逦六十公里，气象万千的建设现场中，处处还留下一些中世纪的东西。新旧对照，显得分外鲜明，也更令人兴奋。在古老长城的脚下，一个个规模巨大的工厂像雨后春笋般出现。长城的颓垣残壁恰好成为它们的厂界围墙的一部分。同这些现代化的工厂比较起来，长城更不为人所注意了。兰州是一个以石油、机械和化学工业为骨骼的工业城市。炼油厂的厂区比旧兰州城区的面积还要大。在它的底下埋藏着的密如蛛网的管道如果全部连接起来，相等于从西安到兰州那样长。现在，银光闪闪体积庞大的贮油罐群已经安装完毕。热裂化炼油装置已经显出全貌。错综复杂的加热炉钢结构炉架也已竖立起来。砌炉工程正在紧张进行。全厂最大的K五塔安装工作已经接近尾声。不久以后这个厂就要部分投入生产。那时候，来自酒泉盆地、柴达木和克拉玛依的原油，就将在这里进行炼制，从1938年发现玉门油矿后开始的我国原油东运的历史，也将结束。一座专门生产石油机械的现代化工厂已在一个月前破土兴建。解放前，兰州只有一个五百瓩的电厂。现在，规模相当于几百个旧兰州电厂的兰州热电站已基本上建成了。从这里通往白银市和附近其他工业区的高压输电铁塔已经屹立起来。一座现代化自来水厂将在年内开始给兰州热电站供水。现在，几项主要工程早已竣工，长达一华里的压力输水干管很快就可以和热电站的自流沟接通。兰州发展到目前已经是一个六十八万人口的城市了。
    兰州是由九块河谷平原组成的带形城市。南倚皋兰山，北峙北塔山。浩荡黄河像一巨幅金色的彩缎，从西向东穿过市区。从整个城市的布局来看，人们夸它为“东方的斯大林格勒”。黄昏时分，市民们喜欢在黄河边上漫步，欣赏长河落日的瑰丽景色，远眺那无帆无舷的羊皮筏子，在惊涛骇浪中安然向东流去。黄河给兰州的市容增添了不少妩媚，但也给城市交通增加一些困难。几年以前的教科书上说：兰州有一座黄河铁桥，指的是清光绪宣统年间德商泰来洋行用已经报废的钢梁承建的“天下黄河第一桥”。它不能适应今天兰州的工业建设需要。因此，解放以后，建桥就成为兰州城市建设中的一个重要组成部分。现在，兰州东西两端已出现了两座长虹似地大桥——包兰铁路大桥和兰新铁路大桥。架桥大军正在忙碌地修建兰州的第五座桥——七里河黄河公路大桥。这是一座可以并行四辆汽车，两旁还有宽达六公尺的人行道的大桥。现在，大桥的一、四、五、六号桥墩和南北两个桥台已经全部竣工，二、三号桥墩也在逐渐升高起来。
    兰州将成为一个铁路交通中心。全长三百四十八公里的天（水）兰（州）铁路，已早于1952年10月正式通车。现在甘肃境内已有一千七百多公里铁路。以兰州为中心，兰新铁路已经跨越戈壁修筑到玉门以西；包兰铁路已经跨过黄河向北伸延到腾格里沙漠。兰州到青海的铁路已经开始航测；兰州到四川的新线也正在勘划中。兰州西郊的铁路枢纽站，将要成为目前全国最大的铁路枢纽站之一。几十条股道，纵横交错，一昼夜可以编组几千辆列车。
