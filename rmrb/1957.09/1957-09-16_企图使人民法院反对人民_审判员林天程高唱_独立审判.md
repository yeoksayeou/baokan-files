Xinhua News Agency, Changchun. The entire staff of the Intermediate People's Court, the Supervisory Court, and the Supervisory Office of the Tonghua Special District in Jilin Province, recently held consecutive meetings to expose and criticize the rightist Lin Tiancheng's malicious attacks on the Communist Party's leadership over judicial work and his reactionary words and deeds aimed at changing the political direction of the People's Court.

Lin Tiancheng is a judge in the Intermediate People's Court of the Tonghua Special District. He has consistently expressed dissatisfaction with the legal system of the new society. During the period of the Great Blooming and Contending, he vigorously praised the Kuomintang's old legal system of so-called "separation of powers, mutual checks and balances," and viciously slandered and attacked the Communist Party's leadership over judicial work and leaders at all levels. He believed that the Party committee's leadership over judicial work was the "greatest restriction" on judges. At the meeting, many cadres who had been engaged in judicial work for many years refuted Lin Tiancheng's absurd proposition of "independent adjudication" based on reason. Everyone pointed out that judicial work is a weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship and must be led by the working class and its political party, as explicitly stipulated in the Constitution. Moreover, the People's Court's independent adjudication and the Party's leadership and supervision are not contradictory. If we act according to the rightist Lin Tiancheng's proposition, it will inevitably change the direction of the People's Court, which is a crime against the people.

Those present also revealed that Lin Tiancheng smeared socialist countries as having "no laws to abide by," while he himself often violated the people's legal system in handling cases, defending counter-revolutionaries and bad elements. When Lin Tiancheng was working in the court's reception room, as soon as he heard a criminal's appeal, he would say to those who demanded "rehabilitation" and were dissatisfied with the government: "My surname is Lin, you can come to me if you have any problems, and I will definitely help you." This rightist also used unscrupulous means to confiscate prisoners' money and accept bribes from criminals' families during the "Three-Anti" movement, and extorted money from prisoners.

　　企图使人民法院反对人民
　　审判员林天程高唱“独立审判”
    新华社长春讯  吉林省通化专区中级人民法院、监察院和监察处的全体工作人员，最近连续集会，揭露和批判右派分子林天程恶毒攻击共产党对司法工作的领导，妄图改变人民法院政治方向的反动言行。
    林天程是通化专区中级人民法院审判员。他对新社会的法制一贯表现不满。在大鸣大放期间，他极力赞扬国民党旧法制的所谓“三权鼎立，互相制约”；恶毒地谩骂和攻击共产党对司法工作的领导和各级领导干部。他认为党委领导司法工作对审判员是“最大的限制”；会上，许多从事司法工作多年的干部据理驳斥了林天程“独立审判”的荒谬主张。大家指出，司法工作是人民民主专政的武器，必须由工人阶级及其政党来领导，这是宪法明文规定的。而且人民法院独立进行审判和党的领导监督并不矛盾。如果按照右派分子林天程的主张去做，就必然会改变人民法院的方向，这对人民来说是犯罪的。
    到会的人还揭露，林天程污蔑社会主义国家“无法可依”，而他自己在判案中却经常破坏人民法制，为反革命分子及坏分子辩护。林天程在法院接待室工作中，一听到犯罪分子的申诉，就对那些要求“平反”和对政府不满的人说：“我姓林，有事可来找我，我一定为你办。”这个右派分子在“三反”运动时还曾经不择手段地没收犯人钱财，接受罪犯家属的贿赂，并向犯人敲诈勒索。
