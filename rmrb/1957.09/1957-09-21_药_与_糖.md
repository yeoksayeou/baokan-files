    "Medicine" and "Sugar"
    Wang Zhong said at a symposium that newspapers "should be like coaxing children to take medicine, adding some sugar so that the children will take it; otherwise, it's too bitter to take."
    Truly worthy of the logic of a rightist. His words are very strategic. He first gives the newspaper a conclusion: it is run like "medicine"; then it is: it is necessary to add some "sugar".
    As we all know, newspapers are the battleground for propagating Marxism-Leninism. We can also experience from real life that the higher the level of propaganda of Marxism-Leninism, the "sweeter" the newspaper is, and the more readers love it. Marxism-Leninism is consistent with "sweetness", and Marxism-Leninism itself is a living truth. There is no need to add any "sugar" at all.
    The reason why Wang Zhong calls the propaganda of Marxism-Leninism a "medicine" that is "too bitter to take" is to promote his "sugar". What kind of stuff is his "sugar"? It is the vulgar and low-level "interestingness" of the bourgeoisie.
    Wang Zhong's conspiracy lies here. Although his words are roundabout, although he speaks "slyly and without leaving a trace," and even uses inappropriate metaphors such as "medicine" and "sugar" to compare today's newspapers, his real intention is to vainly attempt to replace the guiding role of Marxism-Leninism with the bourgeoisie's "interestingness". Didn't he once say: "Interest is the influence people receive under certain social and historical conditions, so it has its inevitable things. We must find this thing to improve the newspaper." This sentence reveals Wang Zhong's purpose of advocating "adding some sugar". This sentence also vividly portrays Wang Zhong's fox tail.

### “药”与“糖”

    “药”与“糖”
    王中在一次座谈会上说，报纸“要像骗小孩子吃药一样，加一些糖，小孩子才吃，否则苦得不能吃。”
    真不愧为右派分子的逻辑。他的这一段话，策略性是很强的，他先给报纸下一个结论：办得像“药”一样；然后就是：非加一些“糖”不可。
    大家知道，报纸是宣传马列主义的阵地。我们从实际生活中也可以体验到：凡宣传马列主义的水平愈高，报纸就办得愈“甜”，读者也愈喜爱。马列主义与“甜”是一致的，马列主义本身就是活生生的真谛。根本无需加什么“糖”。
    王中之所以把宣传马列主义称为“苦得不能吃”的“药”，其目的就是为了推销他的“糖”。他的“糖”是什么货色呢？即资产阶级庸俗低级的“趣味性”是也。
    王中的阴谋就在这里，他的话尽管说得转弯抹角，尽管说得“滑头一些，不露痕迹”，甚至用“药”和“糖”等不伦不类的比喻来比拟今天的报纸，但他的真实企图，就是妄想用资产阶级的“趣味性”来代替马列主义的指导性。他不是曾经说过吗：“兴趣是一定社会历史条件下人们所受到的影响，因此有其必然的东西，我们就要找到这个东西来改进报纸。”这一句话，道出了王中提倡“加一些糖”的目的，这一句话，也就把王中的狐狸尾巴活活勾画出来了。
