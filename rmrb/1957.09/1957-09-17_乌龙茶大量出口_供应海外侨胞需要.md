    Oolong Tea Exported in Large Quantities
    To Supply the Needs of Overseas Compatriots
    Fujian Oolong tea, commonly known as "green leaves with red edges," has recently been shipped in large quantities to Hong Kong and Southeast Asian countries to supply the needs of overseas Chinese. As of August 20, the Anxi and Zhangzhou tea factories in Fujian Province had processed and shipped more than 18,000 boxes of various types of Oolong tea. It is estimated that about 60,000 to 70,000 boxes will be produced this year.
    Oolong tea is abundant in Anxi, Pinghe, Zhao'an, Nan'an, Changtai and other counties in southern Fujian Province. Historically, it has always been a best-selling product overseas and is loved by the vast number of overseas Chinese. There are many varieties of Oolong tea, including Tieguanyin, Sezhong, and Oolong. Among them, "Tieguanyin" is of the best quality and is a treasure among Oolong teas. Its characteristics are: heavy tea body, thick leaves, strong aroma, and many infusions. (Lin Qihua)

    俗称“绿叶红镶边”的福建乌龙茶，最近大量运销香港和东南亚各国，供应华侨需要。截至8月20日为止，福建省安溪、漳州两茶厂已加工出厂各类乌龙茶一万八千多箱。据估计，今年将生产六、七万箱左右。
    乌龙茶盛产于福建省南部安溪、平和、诏安、南安、长泰等县，从历史上以来就一向畅销海外，为我国广大海外侨胞所喜爱。乌龙茶品种很多，有铁观音、色种、乌龙等，其中以“铁观音”品质最优，是乌龙茶中的珍品，它的特点是：茶身重、叶肉厚、香味浓，泡水次数多。　（林琪华）
