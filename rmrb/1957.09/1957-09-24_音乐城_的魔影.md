    The Shadow of Evil in the "City of Music"
    By our reporter, Lin Li

    Guangzhou, known as the "Ancient City of Music," has, in the struggle to counterattack bourgeois right-wingers, exposed an anti-Party clique lurking in the music and art circles.

    The ringleader of this anti-Party clique was Li Yinghang, Deputy Director of the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Culture, Chairman of the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese Musicians Association, and Secretary of the Provisional Party Group of the CMA Branch. Tan Lin, Deputy Secretary-General of the CMA Branch and a Communist Party member, served as the anti-Party clique's "strategist" and "front-line commander." Cai Qudan, a director of the CMA Branch and alternate member of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, openly stepped forward as a "vanguard" to stir up trouble. In addition, Zhao Ben, the Secretary of the joint branch of the Guangzhou Artists Association, CMA, and Dramatists Association, also participated in this anti-Party clique. Under the slogan of "uniting inside and outside the Party," this anti-Party clique roped in a group of anti-Party elements from the three associations, stirring up a considerable counter-current against the Party and socialism.

    Shortly after the Hungarian incident, Li Yinghang abruptly cut off the Guangzhou Cultural Bureau's work guidelines, insisting that the Cultural Bureau should be "drama-centric" and nothing else. Immediately afterwards, under the guise of opposing "drama-centricity," he launched a series of anti-Party activities. He described drama as a "big rock," and music as a "small grass beside the big rock," already in a state of "withering" and "falling into decay." Cai Qudan also painted a bleak and miserable picture of the Guangzhou art scene, saying that Cantonese opera was an all-encompassing "Mount Tai," that folk art was "left to fend for itself," Peking opera had been "relegated to the cold palace," spoken drama was "on its last breath," fine arts were "crying for help," and music had been "uprooted." They said that this situation was caused by the fact that the Director of the Cultural Bureau, Ding Bo, was involved in drama, so he was "drama-centric," and because Mayor Zhu Guang liked fine arts, fine arts had not completely collapsed. Therefore, they proposed to "fight for equality" for arts other than Cantonese opera and to oppose the leadership of the Cultural Bureau.

    Under the guise of "fighting for equality," they went around stirring up trouble, making wild claims, and finally went so far as to "complain" to democratic figures and mobilize people's representatives to "audit the accounts" of the Cultural Bureau. Tan Lin went to the folk art circles to "expand the ranks," wanting the artist Bai Yanzi to "speak out boldly." Bai said that she didn't understand the situation and had nothing to say. Tan Lin then said, "Your folk art performance funding is only 1,500 yuan, while drama performance funding is tens of thousands. Isn't that an opinion?" Li Yinghang once proposed a so-called "seven major and sixteen minor suggestions" to the Party committee, which was actually his political program, aimed at revising the government's second five-year plan regarding the funding arrangements for cultural undertakings, etc. For this despicable conspiracy, Tan Lin arranged a meeting to "besiege the Cultural Bureau," but coincidentally, Director Ding Bo of the Cultural Bureau had something to do that day and did not attend. So they published a message in the Southern Daily, saying that Director Ding Bo did not listen to the opinions of the masses and that the music community was implementing a "strike of expression." In order to realize his anti-Party conspiracy, Li Yinghang even卑躬屈膝 appealed to democratic figures. When Zhao Junmai, a member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, came to Guangzhou for inspection, Li Yinghang first instigated his "vanguard" to contact him, and then attended a symposium convened by Zhao Junmai. At this meeting, Li Yinghang spared no effort in spreading rumors and slanders, saying that striving for funding for the music industry was like "beggars begging for leftovers." Later, when people criticized him for "complaining" to democratic figures behind the Party's back, he replied, "If counter-revolutionaries oppose 'drama-centricity,' that's also good." At this time, Cai Qudan put forward the idea of "guns aimed at the same target." Sure enough, a few days later, Li Yinghang launched two consecutive "audits" and "struggles."

    What exactly was this group of demons and monsters opposing when they opposed drama being the main focus?

    It turned out that the Party Group of the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Culture, in summarizing its work over the past few years, had said this: "In recent years, we have adhered to the policy of developing literary and artistic creation with drama as the main focus, strengthening artistic practice, and carrying out mass amateur cultural and artistic activities." Li Yinghang took this out of context, removing the words below "drama as the main focus." Guangzhou's music work was also not as chaotic as Li Yinghang and others had slandered, and indeed had achieved many successes. In the past three years, the Guangdong Folk Music Troupe and the Guangzhou Orchestra were established to engage in music research, collation, creation, and performance activities, and the Guangzhou Musical Instrument Manufacturing Research Institute was also established. A music college is currently being actively planned. In terms of mass amateur cultural activities, the music group of the Guangzhou Art Museum and the cultural centers in various districts have music cadres who specialize in guiding music activities. At present, there are ten central experimental amateur song and dance troupes in the city, and 223 grassroots music and singing teams. Most factories, enterprises, and rural clubs have music and singing organizations. In addition, more than 50 amateur music training classes have been held, training nearly 5,000 music activists. A five-year-old female pianist has also appeared in Guangzhou.... Li Yinghang and others saw none of this, but insisted that Guangzhou's music was "not as good as before." What is the reason for this?

    According to the exposure, Li Yinghang's anti-Party activities have been consistent. He joined the Party in 1938. When he studied at Lu Yi in Yan'an, he was criticized by the organization for engaging in sectarianism. Later, when he served as the director of the music department at Northeast Normal University, he again used non-Party professors to oppose the Party. When he was transferred to Guangdong in 1955, the Party assigned him eight or nine jobs, but he refused to do any of them. He lived in the guesthouse for ten consecutive months before reluctantly accepting the position of Deputy Director of the Cultural Bureau. However, he regarded himself as an "old Party member," "music professor," and "first-class literary and artistic cadre," felt that the Party Committee had wronged him, and had been dissatisfied with this. He once clamored to go to Guangxi to be the Director of the Department of Culture and Education, and then campaigned to be elected as a people's representative and member of the CPPCC in the province and city. When all of this could not be realized, he opposed the leadership of the Cultural Bureau in many ways, attempting to seize power himself.

    Li Yinghang described his conspiratorial activities as implementing the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and organizing people to "contend." When others advocated no longer opposing the Cultural Bureau, he went everywhere to do "political mobilization," telling them to "struggle hard and persevere to the end." Under Li Yinghang's instigation, Tan Lin also became arrogant. He said to Cai Qudan, "What are you afraid of? At worst, you'll go to jail. You weren't afraid of the Kuomintang's jail, are you afraid of the Communist Party's jail?"

    Now the conspiracy of this anti-Party clique has been completely exposed.

    “音乐城”的魔影
    本报记者　林里
    素称“音乐古城”的广州，在反击资产阶级右派分子的斗争中，揭发了潜伏在音乐、美术界的反党集团。
    这个反党集团的首脑分子，是广州市文化局副局长、中国音乐协会广州分会主席、中共音协分会临时党组书记李鹰航。作为反党集团
  “军师”和“火线指挥官”的，是音协分会副秘书长、共产党员谭林。公开出头放火的“闯将”，是音协分会理事、中国民主促进会广州市委员会候补委员蔡曲旦。此外，参加这个反党集团的还有中共广州美协、音协、剧协联合支部书记赵本等等。这个反党集团在“党内外联合起来”的口号下，笼络了三个协会的一批反党分子，掀起了一股不小的反共反社会主义逆流。
    在匈牙利事件发生后不久，李鹰航就把广州文化局的工作方针斩腰切断，硬说文化局是“以戏剧为主”而不要其他。紧接着就以反对“以戏剧为主”为号召，开展了一连串的反党活动。他把戏剧说成“大石头”，把音乐说成是“大石头旁边的小草”，并且已处于“萎缩不振”和“落英缤纷”的苦境。蔡曲旦还为广州艺术界描绘了一幅阴森凄惨的景象。说粤剧是压倒一切的“泰山”，曲艺在“自生自灭”，京剧已“打入冷宫”，话剧“奄奄一息”，美术“嗷嗷待毙”，音乐“连根拔去”。他们说形成这种状况，是因为文化局局长丁波是搞戏剧的，所以就“以戏剧为主”，又因为朱光市长喜爱美术，所以美术还没有完全垮台。从而，他们就提出要为粤剧以外的艺术“争平等”，要反对文化局的领导。
    在“争平等”的伪装下，他们四出打手，大放厥词，最后竟发展到向民主人士“告状”，发动人民代表到文化局“查账”。谭林曾到曲艺界“扩大队伍”，他要艺人白燕仔“大胆鸣放”，白说不了解情况，无话可说。谭林就说：“你们曲艺会演经费才一千五百元，人家戏剧会演经费好几万，这不就是意见？”李鹰航曾向党委提出一个所谓“七大条，十六小条的建议”，实际上就是他的政治纲领，要修改政府第二个五年计划有关文化事业的经费安排等等。为了这个卑鄙阴谋，谭林曾布置了一个“围攻文化局”的会议，可巧，这天文化局局长丁波有事，没有出席。于是他们就在南方日报上公布了丁波局长不听群众意见、音乐界实行“罢鸣”的消息。为了实现反党阴谋，李鹰航竟卑躬屈膝地去向民主人士呼吁。当民盟中央委员赵君迈来广州视察时，李鹰航初则唆使他的“闯将”去联络，继又出席了赵君迈召开的座谈会。在这次会议上，李鹰航极尽其造谣污蔑的能事，说争取音乐事业费就像“乞丐讨冷饭残羹一样”。后来人们批评他背着党向民主人士“告状”的行为不对，他却回答说：“如果反革命分子反对‘以戏剧为主’，也是好的。”就在这时候，蔡曲旦提出了“枪口一致对外”的主张。果然，不几天后，李鹰航就发动了一连两次的“查账”“斗争”。
    这群妖魔鬼怪，所反对的戏剧为主究竟是怎么回事呢？
    原来，广州市文化局分党组，在总结这几年来的工作时，说过这样一段话：“几年来，我们坚持了发展以戏剧为主的文学艺术创作，加强艺术实践，开展群众业余文化艺术活动的方针”。李鹰航便断章取义，去掉了戏剧为主下面的话。广州市的音乐工作，也不像李鹰航等人所污蔑的那样一团糟，而且确实获得了不少成绩。只是近三年来，这里成立了广东民间音乐团、广州乐团来从事音乐的研究、整理、创作和演出活动，还成立了广州乐器制造研究所。目前正积极筹办音乐专科学校。在群众业余文化活动方面，广州艺术馆音乐组和各区文化馆都有音乐干部，专门从事音乐活动的辅导工作。现在，全市有中心实验性的业余歌舞团十个，基层的音乐、歌咏队二百二十三个，工厂、企业和农村的俱乐部，大多都有音乐、歌咏组织。此外，还举办过五十多期业余音乐训练班，培养了近五千名音乐活动者。广州还出现了五岁的女钢琴家……。这一切，李鹰航等人都看不见，却一味地说广州音乐“今不如昔”。这是什么原因呢？
    据揭发，李鹰航的反党活动带有一贯性。他1938年入党，在延安鲁艺学习时，曾因闹宗派受过组织批评。后来到东北师范大学任音乐系主任，又利用非党教授向党闹对立。1955年调来广东，党分配给他八、九个工作，他都不干，在招待所一连住了十个月，才勉强接受了文化局副局长的职务。但他以“老党员”、“音乐教授”、“文艺一级干部”自居，觉得党委屈了他，并一直为此不满。他曾扬言要到广西去当文教厅长，继又活动当选省、市的人民代表和政协委员。在这一切都不能如愿以偿的时候，就从多方面反对文化局的领导，企图自己执掌大权。
    李鹰航把他的阴谋活动说成是贯彻党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策，是组织人们“争鸣”。在别人主张不再反对文化局的时候，他却到处去做“政治动员”，要他们“艰苦奋斗，坚持到底”，在李鹰航的鼓动下，谭林也嚣张起来，他对蔡曲旦说：“怕什么，顶多是坐牢。国民党的牢你都不怕，难道还怕共产党的牢？”
    现在这个反党集团的阴谋已经完全被揭穿了。
