Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd: Premier Zhou Enlai hosted a banquet this evening in honor of former Indonesian Vice President Dr. Hatta and his wife, along with their entourage.

Premier Zhou and Dr. Hatta both delivered speeches at the banquet. In their speeches, they both emphasized the need to further strengthen the friendly relations between China and Indonesia and to continue to promote the spirit of the Bandung Asian-African Conference in order to consolidate the unity of Asian and African countries and safeguard peace in Asia and the world.

Premier Zhou said that the anti-colonialist movement in Asia and Africa is rising day by day. Faced with the new offensives launched by colonialists against the people of Asia and Africa in the past year through armed aggression and subversive activities, "the people of Asian and African countries are increasingly aware that only by further strengthening internal unity and further promoting the Bandung spirit, consolidating and developing friendly cooperation with each other, can they more effectively safeguard their own independence and more powerfully defend peace in the Asian and African regions."

In his speech, Premier Zhou also praised Dr. Hatta for his outstanding role in striving for Indonesia's independence and autonomy and in promoting friendly relations between China and Indonesia. He wished Dr. Hatta's visit to China would make new contributions to promoting the friendship between the two peoples.

In his speech, Dr. Hatta said that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, co-founded by Premier Zhou Enlai, will become the foundation for building a friendly new world. Although there are still many difficulties in achieving lasting peace and friendship among all nations in this psychologically contradictory world, we can fully promote the realization of lasting world peace and friendship among all nations because the countries participating in the Bandung Conference have set an example.

Dr. Hatta also said that he saw a strong atmosphere of people loving peace and being willing to be friendly with Indonesia everywhere in China, and he expressed his intention to further enhance the friendly relations between the two countries during this visit.

Among those present this evening were Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Li Fuchun, Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, and Chen Shutong, President of the Supreme People's Court Dong Biwu, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC and President of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association Bao Erhan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, and well-known figures from all walks of life in our country.

The Indonesian Ambassador to China and envoys from various countries to China were also invited to attend the banquet this evening.

A reception was held before the banquet. At the reception, Dr. Hatta and his entourage were introduced to the responsible persons and representatives from all aspects of our country by Premier Zhou Enlai and others. (Attached picture)
