    Green Manure Fields – Miniature “Fertilizer Plants”
    One Mu of Green Manure Contains Nitrogen Equivalent to 10 to 16 Jin of Ammonium Sulfate

    The winter sowing season for green manure in southern regions is fast approaching. Many southern provinces are preparing to expand their sown area this year to fully utilize this important fertilizer source to increase rice and cotton production. Judging from the arrangements made by the ten provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Fujian, Guangxi, and Guangdong, the total area sown with green manure this winter may exceed 50 million mu, higher than the total area of green manure plowed under this spring in twelve provinces.
    Chinese farmers have a long history of using green manure. According to the records of some ancient agricultural books, Chinese farmers knew how to use wild green manure three thousand years ago; the cultivation of green manure began more than a thousand years ago. Through long-term practice, farmers have deeply realized its benefits for agricultural production. The agricultural proverbs circulating in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other regions, such as "Pig manure and red clover are two treasures of the farmer's family" and "One year of red clover, three years of good land," are summaries of their experience in using green manure.
    How effective is green manure? According to analysis by scientific research departments, just considering its nitrogen content, every thousand jin of fresh grass contains three and a half to five and a half jin of nitrogen. According to this standard, the nitrogen contained in one mu of green manure producing 3,000 jin of fresh grass is equivalent to 10.5 to 16.5 jin of ammonium sulfate. If the green manure sown this winter in the South can all produce 3,000 jin of fresh grass per mu, then the nitrogen fertilizer it can produce for us is equivalent to 1.25 million tons to 2 million tons of "ammonium sulfate." This number exceeds the total amount of chemical fertilizer currently supplied by the state each year. From this point of view, tens of millions of mu of green manure fields are truly like many small chemical fertilizer manufacturing plants scattered in the countryside.
    Some green manure crops not only fertilize the fields but are also good feed. Farmers in Sichuan have this practice: one mu of green manure producing about 3,000 jin can be used to fertilize two mu of spring fields and also feed one pig.
    The planting area of green manure in the South is gradually expanding. The area of green manure plowed under this spring increased by 40% compared to 1952. Should the planting area of green manure be further expanded? Yes, it should be expanded. According to the preliminary arrangements of various southern provinces, the total area of green manure will be expanded to more than 100 million mu during the Second Five-Year Plan.
    In recent years, the yield per unit area of green manure has also been continuously improving. The average yield of green manure in 1956 increased by 30% compared to 1952. Like other crops, the yield per unit area of green manure varies greatly. In 1956, the average yield of green manure was more than 1,300 jin of fresh grass per mu. The yield in low-yield areas was only a few hundred jin, but the yield in high-yield areas generally exceeded 10,000 jin. This situation shows that the potential for increasing green manure production is great.
    At present, although the winter-sown green manure crops in the South are still the same varieties that were promoted in the past—purple clover (red clover), milk vetch, alfalfa, and oil radish—there have been many changes in the planting range and planting techniques. In the past, only Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other places had the habit of planting purple clover, but now Jiangxi and Hunan are also actively promoting it, and Guangdong and Fujian are also constantly expanding the trial planting areas. Inoculating rhizobia when sowing some leguminous green manure and using more phosphorus and potassium fertilizers to cultivate green manure fields are both methods that have only been promoted in recent years.

    绿肥田——小型的“化肥厂”
    一亩绿肥所含的氮素相当于硫酸铵十至十六斤

    南方地区冬种绿肥的播种季节很快就要到来了。南方许多省为了充分利用这项重要的肥源增产稻谷和棉花，都准备扩大今年的播种面积。从浙江、江苏、湖北、湖南、安徽、江西、四川、福建、广西、广东十个省的安排看，今年冬播绿肥的总面积可能超过五千万亩，高于今年十二个省春翻绿肥的总面积。
    我国农民利用绿肥有悠久的历史。根据一些古农书的记载，三千年前我国农民就会利用野生绿肥；开始栽培绿肥也有一千多年了。农民经过长期实践，深刻认识到它对农业生产的好处。江苏、浙江一带流传的农谚：“猪粪、红花草，农家两个宝”，“一年红花草，三年好地脚”，就是他们使用绿肥的经验总结。
    绿肥的肥效究竟有多大呢？据科学研究部门分析，只以它含的氮素说，每千斤鲜草就有三斤半到五斤半。按这个标准计算，一亩产鲜草三千斤的绿肥所含的氮素，就等于十斤半到十六斤半硫酸铵。如果今年南方冬播的绿肥都能亩产鲜草三千斤，那么，它就可以为我们生产的氮肥就等于一百二十五万吨到二百万吨“硫酸铵”。这个数字超过现在国家每年供应化肥的总数。从这一点讲，几千万亩绿肥田，真像我们分散在农村的许多小型的化学肥料制造厂。
    有些绿肥作物不但能肥田，并且是很好的饲料。四川的农民就有这样的作法：一亩产三千斤左右的绿肥，除了肥两亩小春田以外，还可以用它喂一只猪。
    南方绿肥的种植面积在逐渐扩大着，今年春翻绿肥田的面积比1952年增加了40％。绿肥的种植面积是不是还要扩大呢？是要扩大的。根据南方各省的初步安排，在第二个五年计划当中，绿肥的总面积将扩大到一亿亩以上。
    这几年来，绿肥的单位产量也在不断提高，1956年绿肥平均产量比1952年提高了30％。绿肥也和其他作物一样，单位产量高低悬殊。1956年绿肥平均每亩产鲜草一千三百多斤，产量低的地区只有几百斤，可是产量高的一般都超过万斤。这个情况说明，增产绿肥的潜力是很大的。
    目前南方冬播的绿肥作物虽然还是过去推广的几种——紫云英（红花草）、苕子、金花菜和肥田萝卜等，但种植范围和种植技术却有不少改变。过去只有江苏、浙江等地有种植紫云英的习惯，现在江西、湖南也积极推广了，广东、福建也在不断扩大试种地区。在播种一些豆科绿肥的时候接种根瘤菌和多用磷、钾肥料培育绿肥田，都是近几年才推广的。（附图片）
