　　Characteristics and Experiences of Socialist Transformation of Agriculture in Bulgaria
　　S. Todorov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party

　　Before the establishment of the Bulgarian people's regime, agriculture was characterized by scattered operations, rough cultivation, and rudimentary agricultural tools. It was very backward compared to the economically advanced countries of Europe. Therefore, one of the very complex and arduous tasks facing the Bulgarian Communist Party and the People's Government was to transform the small private agricultural economy on a socialist basis, making it a high-yielding agricultural economy that could meet the country's needs for food and raw materials and ensure improved living standards for working farmers.
    Due to the special land relations in the Bulgarian countryside, conditions did not allow for the nationalization of land. On the other hand, the idea of agricultural cooperation had already gained some foundation and the trust of farmers before the war through rural consumer cooperatives. Even before the establishment of the people's regime, in more than thirty villages, the most progressive farmers, under the leadership and influence of Communist Party members, organized agricultural labor cooperatives. It was in these labor cooperatives, established by the farmers themselves to improve their living conditions, that the Party found the most suitable special form for the painless transition of farmers to socialism under Bulgarian conditions.

    Agricultural labor cooperatives and collective farms have many common characteristics, but also some essential differences, the main one being that land remains the private property of the members. Although this private property is limited, members can still receive land dividends when distributing income.

    The existence of private land ownership undoubtedly hinders the transition of farmers to socialist forms of agriculture, but it is not an insurmountable obstacle. Under specific conditions, this transition will be a more complex process and will be achieved through rather special forms. This by no means negates the path taken by Soviet farmers in their transition to socialism, as the general laws of the transition period apply to all countries building socialism. The historically significant experience of the Soviet collective farm construction will continue to be our guiding light. The characteristics of the transition of our farmers to socialist forms lie in the fact that the issue of land nationalization will be resolved in practice by the farmers themselves. Georgi Dimitrov pointed out in 1948: "As poor and middle peasants are gradually absorbed into labor cooperatives, with the development of machinery and tractor stations, by prohibiting land leasing, restricting and further prohibiting land sales, by reducing and further abolishing land rent, when conditions permit, according to the decision of the cooperative farmers themselves, the problem of land nationalization will be practically solved by permanently handing over all land to the labor cooperatives for use."

    The Party's policy towards the rich peasant class is one of squeezing out and eliminating them. We have steadfastly implemented this policy through various methods: carrying out land reform, limiting land ownership to within twenty hectares, allowing thirty hectares only in a typical grain-producing area; confiscating large agricultural implements; confiscating various shops and production workshops in the countryside belonging to rich peasants; implementing state purchase systems, taxation systems, and other similar measures. After the fundamental socio-economic reforms in our country, the economic power of the rich peasants has been greatly weakened, their proportion in agricultural production has greatly decreased, and continues to decrease. The model charter of agricultural labor cooperatives stipulates that rich peasants are not allowed to join labor cooperatives. During the period of establishment and consolidation of labor cooperatives, this policy of the Party was the only correct one and achieved good results. Currently, labor cooperatives have become consolidated and powerful cooperative economies, so the issue of absorbing rich peasants has been resolved in this way: labor cooperatives can absorb and have absorbed former rich peasants into the cooperatives, but they must not be allowed to hold leadership positions in the cooperatives. The Party believes that socialist production relations and collective labor in labor cooperatives can change and ultimately transform a considerable portion of the former rich peasants. Of course, some former rich peasant members may attempt to hinder the consolidation of the cooperative and obstruct various measures to improve agricultural production after joining the labor cooperative. These former rich peasant members will be subject to the most severe sanctions in accordance with state laws.

    In the past seven or eight years, Bulgaria has achieved significant results in its agricultural cooperation. Currently, 82% of farmers are united in agricultural labor cooperatives. The cooperative system has achieved a comprehensive victory in our countryside.

    Our achievements in this area are due to the Bulgarian Communist Party's formulation of a correct line and its firm implementation of this line. In the struggle to transform agriculture along socialist lines, the Party creatively applied Lenin's cooperative plan in accordance with Bulgaria's specific conditions.

    Due to the Party's large-scale political work among the masses to publicize the superiority of agricultural cooperation, the Party's line and policies have become well known to every household and have been supported by the majority of working farmers. In the process of establishing agricultural labor cooperatives, the Party strictly adhered to the principle of voluntariness and carried out a sharp struggle against the deviations and distortions of policies by some local leaders in implementing policies. This has further consolidated the farmers' trust in the Party and the people's regime.

    The state's economic and material assistance to agricultural labor cooperatives in the form of long-term loans has played a huge role in the consolidation and development of the rural cooperative system. By the end of 1956, the average public property of each cooperative, excluding land, had reached over three million leva (Bulgarian currency).

    Without the establishment of machine tractor stations, the rapid development and consolidation of cooperatives would have been impossible. Currently, there are two hundred and eight machine tractor stations throughout the country, with nearly two thousand tractor teams. There are more than 25,000 tractors, calculated at 15 horsepower per unit, and more than 4,000 combine harvesters. 70% of field work has been mechanized. The Soviet Union has given us tremendous assistance in agricultural mechanization.

    The cooperation and mechanization of agriculture in our country have created favorable conditions for increasing agricultural production and increasing agricultural products. The total amount of agricultural products now exceeds the pre-war level by 10%. Ensuring the production of the necessary amount of mineral fertilizers is a top priority for increasing agricultural output in our country. To this end, we are working hard to build new and expand existing chemical fertilizer factories, so that by 1960-1961 we will be able to fertilize 200 kilograms per hectare, compared to only 40 to 50 kilograms now.

    The main problem facing agriculture in our country at present is the need for intensive cultivation. Our country has an average of 0.6 hectares of cultivated land per person. In the case of rough cultivation, the income per unit area is low, and it causes farmers to be idle for a long time - working an average of 150 days per year. The task we have put forward is to increase the farmers' working period, increase the income per hectare, and thereby increase the average income of the agricultural population. We should drastically increase the income of existing land, because we do not have the possibility to expand the land area. A sharp increase in the income of existing land area can be achieved, and the main way to do this is to promote economic crops, expand vineyards and orchards, and promote vegetables, tobacco, spices, oil crops, etc.

    With the expansion of the production of grapes, fruits, and vegetables, our country will increase the export of these products and their processed products. This will create conditions for the best possible supply of such commodities to the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and our imports of wheat, cotton, metals, machinery, and other commodities from the Soviet Union and people's democracies will be further expanded.

    The direction of agricultural development in our country is determined according to the principle of specialization and division of labor among socialist countries. The purpose of specialization and division of labor is to make the most rational use of the economic and natural conditions of each country, as well as the experience and traditions of the people. Corresponding agreements have been reached on this issue during the negotiations between the Bulgarian and Soviet party and state leaders held at the beginning of this year, and in April of this year, the four-country agreement was concretized and adopted at the meeting of the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and Bulgaria.

    In animal husbandry in our agriculture, the cooperatives mainly strive to improve livestock breeds and increase livestock product rates. The number of dairy cows is now multiplying rapidly, and the amount of milk produced by cooperatives has more than doubled compared to pre-war levels. Pig breeding is also developing rapidly, with the number of pigs exceeding double the pre-war level. Pig breeding has become the main source of meat supply for residents. In sheep breeding, we are striving to breed fine-wool sheep by crossbreeding local sheep with Merino sheep. Artificial insemination is widely used for this purpose. Due to the development of mechanization, the demand for draught animals has been greatly reduced, so a policy of accelerating the reduction of surplus horses and oxen has been adopted. We are working hard to solve the feed problem. Forage storage has been greatly improved, and the feed for cooperative livestock is guaranteed.

    In order to increase the farmers' concern for developing production from material interests, a series of measures have recently been taken: the state has stopped purchasing milk, hay, potatoes, grapes, apples, and plums; the purchase price of fine wool has doubled; on the basis of prices favorable to the cooperatives, it is allowed to submit beef and pork instead of the state purchase of corn and barley; the purchase price of grapes and fruits has been greatly increased; the price of certain industrial products necessary for agricultural production has been reduced; the state has completely stopped purchasing grain from cooperatives and individual farmers in mountainous areas, and reduced the amount of grain purchased in semi-mountainous areas and cash crop areas; and so on.

    According to the decision of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the government, a pension system for elderly cooperative members has been implemented on January 1 of this year, which has a particularly favorable impact on the development of cooperatives. According to this system, women who have engaged in productive labor in the agricultural sector for twenty-five years and are at least fifty-five years old, and men who are at least sixty years old can enjoy pension benefits.

    Speaking of the achievements we have made in socialist construction, especially in the socialist transformation of agriculture, we must first thank the great Soviet Union for its brotherly and selfless assistance. The Bulgarian people, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party and with the decisive help of the Soviet Union, gained freedom on September 9, 1944. For the past thirteen years, our country has always received spiritual and material assistance from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries in socialist construction. We have learned a lot from the Soviet Union's rich experience in building collective farms and continue to learn. The forty years of experience of the first socialist country is the greatest achievement of the working people of the world and is the beacon for all countries that are building socialism.

　　保加利亚农业社会主义改造的特点和经验
　　保加利亚共产党中央委员会书记  斯·托多罗夫
    在保加利亚人民政权建立以前，农业的特点就是经营分散、耕作粗糙和农具简陋。和欧洲各经济先进国家比较起来，它是非常落后的。因此，保加利亚共产党和人民政府所面临的十分复杂和艰巨的任务之一，就是要在社会主义的基础上改造小私有制的农业经济，使它成为收获量高的、能满足我国食品和原料需要并保证提高劳动农民生活水平的农业经济。
    由于保加利亚农村中的特殊的土地关系，条件不允许实行土地国有化。另一方面，农业合作化的思想早在战前就已通过农村消费合作社而获得了一些基础和农民的信任。还在人民政权建立以前，在三十多个农村中，最进步的农民在共产党员的领导和影响下，就组织了农业劳动合作社。正是在这些农民自己为改善生活条件而成立的劳动合作社中，党找到了在保加利亚的条件下使农民无痛苦地向社会主义过渡的最合适的特殊形式。
    农业劳动合作社和集体农庄有许多共同的特点，但也有若干本质上的区别，主要是土地仍是社员们的私有财产。虽然这种私有财产是有限的，但社员们在分配收入时仍能因此而得到土地分红。
    土地私人占有制的存在，无疑地不利于农民向社会主义的农业形式过渡，但不是不可克服的障碍。在具体的条件下，这一过渡将是一个比较复杂的过程，而且将通过相当特殊的形式来实现。而这决不意味着否定苏联农民向社会主义过渡中走过的道路，因为过渡时期的一般规律对于一切建设社会主义的国家都是适用的。苏联集体农庄建设事业的具有世界历史意义的经验，过去曾是而且将来也是我们的指路明灯。我国农民向社会主义形式过渡中的特点在于：土地国有化问题在实际中将由农民自己来解决。乔治·季米特洛夫在1948年曾经指出：“随着贫农和中农逐渐地被吸收到劳动合作社来，随着机器和拖拉机站的发展，通过禁止土地出租、限制并进而禁止土地买卖的方法，通过减低地租并进而取消地租的方法，在条件许可的时候，根据合作社农民自己的决定，将全部土地永久地交给劳动合作社使用，这在实际上将解决土地国有化的问题”。
    党对待富农阶级采取的政策是排挤和消灭的政策。我们通过各种方法坚定不移地实行了这一政策：进行了土地改革，将土地占有面积限制在二十公顷以内，只是在一个典型的谷物产区中许可占有三十公顷土地；没收了大型农具；没收了农村中属于富农的各种商店和生产作坊；实行了国家征购制、税收制以及其他类似的措施。在我国实行了根本性的社会经济改革以后，富农的经济势力大大地削弱了，他们在农业生产中所占的比重已大大下降，并在继续下降。农业劳动合作社示范章程规定不准吸收富农参加劳动合作社。在劳动合作社建立和巩固的时期，党的这种政策是唯一正确的，并且得到了良好的效果。目前，劳动合作社已经成为巩固的强大的合作化经济，所以关于吸收富农的问题就这样解决了：劳动合作社可以吸收而且已经吸收了过去的富农入社，但不得让他们担任合作社中的领导工作。党认为，劳动合作社中的社会主义生产关系和集体劳动能够改变以至最后改造相当部分的过去的富农。当然，一些过去的富农，在加入了劳动合作社以后可能企图妨害合作社的巩固，阻扰各种提高农业生产的措施。对待这些过去的富农社员将根据国家的法律给予最严厉的制裁。
    最近七、八年来，保加利亚农业合作化事业取得了重大的成绩。目前已有82％的农民联合在农业劳动合作社中。合作社制度在我国的农村中取得了全面的胜利。
    我国在这方面获得的成绩是由于保加利亚共产党制定了正确的路线，并且坚定地执行了这一路线。在进行农业社会主义改造的斗争中，党根据保加利亚的具体条件创造性地运用了列宁的合作化计划。
    由于党在群众中进行了大规模的宣传农业合作化优越性的政治工作，党的路线和政策在农民中已家喻户晓，得到大多数劳动农民的拥护与支持。在建立农业劳动合作社的过程中，党严格地遵守了自愿的原则，并且对某些地方负责人在执行政策中的偏差和曲解进行了尖锐的斗争。这就更加巩固了农民对党和人民政权的信任。
    国家以长期贷款形式给予农业劳动合作社的经济和物质援助，在农村合作社制度的巩固和发展方面起了巨大的作用。到1956年年底，除土地外，每个合作社的公共财产平均已达三百万列弗（保币）以上。
    没有机器拖拉机站的建立，合作社的迅速发展和巩固是不可能的。目前全国有机器拖拉机站二百零八个，其中拖拉机队将近两千个。按每台十五马力计算，共有拖拉机二万五千多台，康拜因四千多台。田间工作的70％已经机械化。苏联在农业机械化方面给了我们巨大的援助。
    我国农业的合作化和机械化为提高农业生产和增加农产品创造了有利的条件。现在农产品总量已超过战前10％。保证生产必要数量的矿物肥料是提高我国农业产量的头等重要的任务。为此我们正努力建设新的和扩大现有的化学肥料工厂，以便到1960—1961年我们能够在每公顷土地上施肥二百公斤，而现在只有四十到五十公斤。
    目前我国农业的主要问题是需要进行精耕细作。我国每人平均有耕地零点六公顷，在耕作粗糙的情况下，单位面积的收入是低微的，并且造成农民长期的空闲现象——每年平均工作一百五十天。我们提出的任务是：增加农民的劳作期，提高每公顷土地的收入，从而提高农业人口的平均收入。我们应当急剧增加现有土地的收入，因为我们没有可能来扩大土地面积。急剧提高现有土地面积的收入是可以达到的，其主要办法就是推广经济作物，扩大葡萄园和果园，推广蔬菜、烟草、香料、油料作物等。
    随着葡萄、水果和蔬菜生产的扩大，我国将增加这些产品及其加工品的出口。这样就能为最好地供应苏联和其他社会主义国家这类商品创造条件，而我们从苏联和人民民主国家换回的小麦、棉花、金属、机器等商品的进口也将进一步扩大。
    我国农业发展的方向是根据社会主义国家间专业化和分工的原则确定的。专业化和分工的目的在于最合理地利用每一个国家的经济条件和自然条件以及人民的经验和传统。在今年年初举行的保加利亚和苏联党和国家领导人的谈判中，就这个问题已达成相应的协议，本年4月又在德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、苏联和保加利亚的部长会议上加以具体化而通过了四国协定。
    在我国农业中的畜牧业方面，合作社主要是努力改良牲畜品种和提高牲畜产品率。现在奶牛繁殖很快，合作社的挤奶量已超过战前一倍。养猪业也在迅速发展，养猪头数超过战前一倍。养猪业已成为供应居民肉食的主要源泉。在养羊业方面，我们正努力用本地羊和美利奴细毛羊杂交的方式繁殖细毛绵羊。为此广泛地采用了人工授精的办法。由于机械化的发展，对役畜的需求大大减少了，因而采取了加速削减多余的马匹和犍牛的方针。我们正大力解决饲料问题。饲草储藏已大有改进，合作社牲畜的饲草已有保证。
    为了提高农民从物质利益对发展生产的关怀，最近采取了一系列的措施：国家停止征购牛奶、干草、马铃薯、葡萄、苹果和李子；细羊毛的采购价格提高了一倍；在对合作社有利的比价基础上，允许上缴牛肉和猪肉代替国家征购的玉米和大麦；大大提高葡萄和水果的采购价格；降低农业生产所必需的某些工业品的价格；国家完全停止向山区的合作社和个体农民征购粮食，减少半山区和经济作物区的粮食征购额；等等。
    根据保加利亚共产党和政府的决议，今年1月1日已实行老年社员的养老金制度，这对合作社的发展有着特别有利的影响。根据这个制度，凡在农业部门从事生产劳动二十五年、年满五十五岁的妇女和年满六十岁的男子都可享受养老金的待遇。
    谈到我国在社会主义建设中、特别是在农业社会主义改造中获得的成绩，我们首先要感谢伟大苏联给予我们的兄弟般的无私的援助。保加利亚人民在保加利亚共产党的领导和苏联的具有决定意义的帮助下，于1944年9月9日获得了自由。十三年来，我国在社会主义建设中一向得到苏联和人民民主国家的精神上和物质上的援助。我们从苏联建设集体农庄的丰富经验中学到了很多东西并且在继续学习。第一个社会主义国家四十年来的经验，是全世界劳动人民最伟大的成果，是所有正在建设社会主义的国家的灯塔。
