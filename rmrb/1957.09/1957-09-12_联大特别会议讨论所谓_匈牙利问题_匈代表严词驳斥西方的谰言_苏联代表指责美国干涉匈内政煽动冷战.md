Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch from New York: Under the instigation of the United States and some countries supporting it, the United Nations General Assembly held a special session on the 10th, morning and afternoon, to begin discussing the so-called "Hungarian question."

　　The United States representative, Lodge, and thirty-five other countries put forward a proposal. This proposal reiterated the resolution of the Eleventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly interfering in Hungary's internal affairs and expressed agreement with the report of the so-called "Special Committee on the Hungarian Question," which was established based on this illegal resolution. The proposal described the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion, which was planned and instigated by international reactionary forces last year, as "a spontaneous national uprising" and slandered the Soviet Union's assistance to the Hungarian government in suppressing the counter-revolution as "violating the United Nations Charter." The proposal also slandered the Hungarian government for "violating" human rights and freedoms.

　　The proposal recommended "condemning" the Soviet Union and the Hungarian government, and requested the President of the Eleventh United Nations General Assembly, Prince Wan Waithayakon, as the United Nations General Assembly's special representative on the Hungarian question, to take "appropriate steps," submit reports to the United Nations General Assembly, and make "desirable recommendations." The proposal also recommended including the Hungarian question on the agenda of the Twelfth United Nations General Assembly.

　　The United States representative, Lodge, repeatedly called on people not to "despair" of the counter-revolutionary elements in Hungary in his speech, and demanded that countries supporting the above proposal should adopt a "firm" attitude.

　　The Hungarian representative, Mod Peter, refuted the Western slanders in his speech. He said that the measures taken by the Hungarian government to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion were approved by the Hungarian National Assembly, which expressed the will of the independent and autonomous Hungarian people. He pointed out that the so-called "Special Committee on the Hungarian Question" was illegal, and lodged a firm protest against the General Assembly's discussion of the "Hungarian question." He demanded that the discussion of this unreasonable interference in Hungary's internal affairs be removed from the agenda of the General Assembly.

　　Mod Peter also refuted the claim that the Hungarian event was a "spontaneous national uprising." He pointed out that the aim of the armed rebellion that took place in Hungary last year was to use violence to overthrow the Hungarian government and social order, in order to restore the fascist regime against the Hungarian people. This counter-revolutionary rebellion was prepared, launched and supported by Western imperialist groups.

　　The Hungarian representative pointed out that the measures taken by the Hungarian government during and after the rebellion were based on its constitutionally defined responsibilities, and these measures helped protect Hungary's legal order. At the same time, considering that the rebellion constituted a threat to peace, the Hungarian government requested the Soviet government, as one of the signatory countries to the Warsaw Pact, to freely use its troops stationed in Hungary in accordance with that treaty. Contrary to the Special Committee's distorted depiction of Hungary, the Hungarian government and the working people of Hungary have now re-established a legal and constitutional order in the country.

　　Mod Peter said that the Hungarian government believes that the United Nations General Assembly should note that the establishment of the "Special Committee on the Hungarian Question" is not in accordance with the United Nations Charter and should therefore be dissolved. The United Nations General Assembly should condemn the committee's report, considering it an interference in Hungary's internal affairs, a slander, and an incitement to war.

　　The Soviet representative, Sobolev, supported the Hungarian representative's request. He said: The Soviet Union believes that the discussion of the so-called "Hungarian question" and the report of the "Special Committee on the Hungarian Question" are illegal and contradict the United Nations Charter. The convening of a special session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss this provocative issue shows that certain countries, primarily the ruling circles of the United States, have not abandoned their attempts to intolerably interfere in Hungary's internal affairs and to use the United Nations to intensify international tensions and conduct hostile propaganda against Hungary, the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries. The Hungarian people firmly condemned the international reactionaries' interference in internal affairs and attempts to re-launch counter-revolutionary adventures in Hungary.

　　The Soviet representative continued, it is no accident that this conference is being held one week before the start of the Twelfth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. The United States and certain Western countries are attempting to divert world public opinion from the aggressive actions of the United States, Britain, and France in the Middle East and other parts of the world, to prevent world public opinion from paying attention to these countries' refusal to reach agreements on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and to their sinister attitude towards many issues on the agenda of the Twelfth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. At the same time, they hope to poison the working atmosphere of the Twelfth Session of the United Nations General Assembly through the discussion of the "Hungarian question" and create a Cold War situation before the start of the conference.

　　The Czechoslovak representative, Ulihc, also requested to speak according to the procedures of the meeting. However, the President of the General Assembly, Wan Waithayakon, who had already been selected in the US proposal to play the role of "Special Commissioner of the United Nations on the Hungarian Question," announced his decision, stating that despite objections, the Hungarian question would still be discussed. He did not allow the Czechoslovak representative to speak.

　　Representatives from Australia, Ireland, Denmark, the Philippines, and other countries also spoke at the meeting.

　　The next special session will be held on the 11th.

### 联大特别会议讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”　匈代表严词驳斥西方的谰言　苏联代表指责美国干涉匈内政煽动冷战

　　联大特别会议讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”
　　匈代表严词驳斥西方的谰言
　　苏联代表指责美国干涉匈内政煽动冷战
    新华社11日讯　纽约消息：在美国和支持它的一些国家的策动之下，联合国大会10日上下午举行特别会议开始讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”。
    美国代表洛奇和其他三十五个国家提出一项提案。这项提案重申联合国大会第十一届会议作出的干涉匈牙利内政的决议，并且对根据这个非法决议而成立的所谓“匈牙利问题特别委员会”的报告表示同意。提案把国际反动势力在去年策划和煽动起来的匈牙利反革命叛乱说成是“一次自发的民族起义”，并且污蔑苏联帮助匈牙利政府镇压反革命的行为“违背联合国宪章”。提案还污蔑匈牙利政府“违反”人权和自由。
    提案建议对苏联和匈牙利政府进行“谴责”，并且要求第十一届联合国大会主席旺·威泰耶康亲王作为匈牙利问题的联合国大会特别代表，采取“适当的步骤”、向联合国大会提出报告和作出“可取的建议”。提案同时还建议把匈牙利问题列入第十二届联合国大会的议程。
    美国代表洛奇在发言中一再呼吁不要对匈牙利的反革命分子“绝望”，并且要求支持上述提案的国家态度要“坚决”。
    匈牙利代表莫德·彼得在发言中驳斥了西方的谰言。他说，匈牙利政府为了镇压反革命叛乱而采取的措施是得到表达独立自主的匈牙利人民意志的匈牙利国民议会批准的。他指出所谓“匈牙利问题特别委员会”是不合法的，并且对大会讨论“匈牙利问题”提出坚决的抗议。他要求从大会的议程中取消这种无理干涉匈牙利内政的讨论。
    莫德·彼得还驳斥了所谓匈牙利事件是“自发的民族起义”的说法。他指出，去年在匈牙利发生的武装叛乱的目的是要用暴力来推翻匈牙利政府和社会秩序，以便恢复反对匈牙利人民的法西斯政权。这个反革命叛乱是西方帝国主义集团所准备、发动和支持的。
    匈牙利代表指出，匈牙利政府在叛乱期间和叛乱以后所采取的措施都是以宪法规定的责任为根据，这些措施有助于保护匈牙利的法律秩序。同时，考虑到这次叛乱构成对和平的一个威胁，匈牙利政府要求苏联政府作为华沙条约缔约国之一自由使用它根据那个条约驻在匈牙利的军队。与特别委员会对匈牙利的歪曲事实的描绘相反，匈牙利政府和匈牙利的劳动人民目前已经在这个国家里重新建立了合乎法律和宪法规定的秩序。
    莫德·彼得说，匈牙利政府认为，联合国大会应当注意到，设立“匈牙利问题特别委员会”是不符合联合国宪章的，因此应该把它解散。联合国大会应当谴责这个委员会的报告，认为它是对匈牙利内政的干涉，是一种污蔑，是煽动战争。
    苏联代表索波列夫支持匈牙利代表的要求。他说：苏联认为，讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”以及“匈牙利问题特别委员会”的报告是不合法的，并且是同联合国宪章相抵触的。联合国大会召开特别会议来讨论这个挑拨性的问题表明，某些国家，首先是美国的统治集团还没有放弃不可容忍地干涉匈牙利内政的企图和利用联合国来加剧国际紧张局势，来进行反对匈牙利，反对苏联以及其他社会主义国家的敌意宣传的企图。匈牙利人民坚决斥责国际反动派干涉内政以及在匈牙利重新发动反革命冒险的企图。
    苏联代表继续说，这次大会在联合国大会第十二届会议开始前一星期召开，这件事并不是偶然的。美国和某些西方国家企图转移世界舆论对美国、英国和法国在中近东及世界的其他地区的侵略行动的注意，使世界舆论不去注意这些国家拒绝达成关于裁军和禁止原子武器的协议的做法以及这些国家对第十二届联合国大会议程中许多问题的险恶态度。同时，他们指望通过关于“匈牙利问题”的讨论来毒化第十二届联合国大会的工作气氛，在大会开始前造成一种冷战的局面。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表乌里赫也根据会议进行的程序要求发言。但是，已经在美国的提案中被选定担任“联合国匈牙利问题特别委员”的角色的大会主席旺·威泰耶康宣布了自己的决定，他表示尽管有人反对，匈牙利问题仍然要讨论。他不允许捷克斯洛伐克代表发言。
    在会上发言的还有澳大利亚、爱尔兰、丹麦、菲律宾等国代表。
    特别会议下次会议在11日举行。
