　　State Council Decision on Further Improving Disaster Relief Work
　　(Adopted at the 57th Plenary Meeting of the State Council on September 6, 1957)
　　Since July this year, some areas of Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Heilongjiang, and Jilin provinces have suffered from floods, and some areas of Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces have suffered from droughts. Some areas of Guangdong Province have suffered from typhoon disasters. According to the current situation, the disaster situation nationwide is lighter than in 1954 and 1956. However, the situation is still severe in some local areas, and disaster relief work is arduous. In order to further improve disaster relief work, the following decisions are now made:
　　1. Agricultural production is of great importance in China's socialist construction. Agriculture provides food and raw materials for industry, and the countryside is a huge market for industrial products. Without developed agriculture, there can be no developed industry. In a country like China, with its vast land and a climate spanning cold, temperate, and subtropical zones, local natural disasters occur every year. Therefore, engaging in agricultural production inevitably involves fighting against natural disasters to achieve development. Therefore, all localities should not view disaster relief work in isolation but should regard it as an important part of developing agricultural production. At the same time, disaster relief work should be combined with the development of agricultural production. This year, in particular, disaster relief should be combined with farmland water conservancy construction and the manure accumulation campaign during this winter and next spring.
　　2. The key to disaster relief work lies in the importance attached to it by the leadership. All disaster-stricken areas should place disaster relief work in an important position, with leaders taking responsibility and everyone participating. Capable cadres should be sent to the severely affected areas to be responsible for guiding the work from beginning to end and should not be easily transferred until the famine period is over. People should also be sent to lightly affected areas to conduct regular inspections. Cadres in disaster areas should maintain close ties with the masses, share weal and woe, strictly prevent bureaucracy, promptly grasp the disaster situation and its possible changes, and take measures to solve problems. The Production and Disaster Relief Committee and its office should be strengthened, and all relevant departments should closely cooperate to unleash all potential disaster relief forces.
　　3. Consolidating agricultural production cooperatives is a strong guarantee for overcoming natural disasters. Agricultural production cooperatives have already played a superior role in organizing rescues and replanting during the emergency phase and should continue to play a role in disaster relief work, and through disaster relief work, the cooperatives should be further consolidated. Currently, combined with rural socialist education, a major debate should be launched to make disaster victims realize the superiority of relying on cooperatives to overcome natural disasters, to fight against all bad elements who undermine cooperatives, and at the same time to overcome pessimistic, disintegration, and exodus erroneous thoughts.
　　4. Disaster areas should conduct overall planning and arrange plans for each cooperative and each household. First, verify the disaster situation and be realistic, correcting the tendency to exaggerate the disaster situation. Second, arrange production, not only the agricultural and sideline production of cooperatives but also the household sideline production and private plots. The arrangement of production should be combined with the national agricultural capital construction work as much as possible to achieve work relief. Third, arrange the lives of disaster victims, organize mutual assistance, or provide assistance from government agricultural loans or relief funds. Because of the comprehensive planning that is responsible for every disaster victim, the government can not only have a clear understanding and use loans and relief funds in a planned way but also increase the confidence of each disaster-stricken household and encourage the enthusiasm for production.
　　5. In areas where the water situation is still very tense, efforts should be made to protect dikes and engage in rescue work, and various preparations should be made to rescue disaster victims so that they can be transferred safely as soon as possible in case villages are flooded. Disaster victims who have been collectively transferred should be dispersed and integrated into non-disaster-stricken cooperatives if their hometowns are flooded and cannot return home in the short term, but they should not be overly concentrated.
　　6. Disaster areas should launch a high tide of production movement. Strengthen field management of affected crops and late autumn crops, actively prepare fertilizers and seeds for winter wheat, appropriately expand the winter wheat planting area, and ensure that wheat planting is done well. Where vegetables, buckwheat, and sweet potatoes can be rushed to plant, they should be rushed to plant. Non-disaster-stricken areas of disaster-stricken provinces and regions should strive to increase production beyond the target to make up for the deficiencies and support disaster areas. This winter and next spring, we should also carry out various water conservancy construction works such as flood prevention, waterlogging prevention, and drought prevention, and carry out manure accumulation work to launch a mass production movement. We should protect the draught animals in the disaster area and solve the difficulty of insufficient feed by cutting grass and storing it green, rush-planting grain grass, and transferring livestock. Disaster areas should also implement diversified operations and develop collective sideline and household sideline production. Each province and autonomous region should instruct the financial and economic departments to do a good job in arranging and organizing sideline production in disaster areas, actively solve the problems of raw material supply and product sales, and avoid blindness in production and commercial speculation. Agricultural cooperatives in frequently disaster-stricken areas should establish more regular sideline businesses.
　　7. For houses destroyed in water-stricken areas, agricultural production cooperatives must reasonably allocate labor, use old materials, and make do with whatever is available to quickly repair them before winter, but they should also ensure that they are strong and safe. Relief or loans should be given according to the different situations of insufficient funds and materials. Efforts should be made to solve the shortage of firewood for disaster victims and to promote fuel conservation.
　　8. Disaster areas should prevent the spread of epidemics, correct the tendency of cadres to only focus on disaster relief and neglect epidemic prevention, mobilize the masses to carry out health campaigns, improve environmental sanitation, and implement drinking water disinfection. And organize Chinese and Western medical personnel to go deep into the disaster areas for mobile treatment.
　　9. Relief funds should be used when they are most needed and on disaster victims who must be rescued, strictly preventing indiscriminate distribution to avoid fostering the dependency mentality of disaster victims and weakening the enthusiasm for production. The relief standard should be reduced as appropriate, and the tendency of egalitarianism and unfair distribution should be opposed. When distributing relief funds, it should be combined with the production arrangement of each household in the whole cooperative, implement democratic appraisal, only give appropriate relief to disaster victims who have no ability to produce or cannot maintain their lives even if they produce for self-help, and strict procedures should be followed, accounts should be made public, and regular inspections and supervision should be carried out to avoid waste, embezzlement, misappropriation, improper distribution, and other malpractices. Individual farmers who meet the relief conditions should be treated equally. Loans should be issued according to the situation of each agricultural cooperative, and loan collection should be done well in non-disaster areas to support disaster areas.
　　10. Disaster areas should vigorously promote thrift, mobilize disaster victims to collect all available substitutes for food, and prohibit using grain to make wine and boil sugar. Extravagant and wasteful behaviors such as gift-giving and entertaining guests should be corrected. Provinces and regions with disasters should also practice economy in their cities, industrial and mining areas, and non-disaster-stricken rural areas, appropriately reduce the grain supply standard to adapt to the situation of the province suffering from disasters.
　　11. This year, grain production in some disaster areas has been greatly reduced and needs to be transferred from other provinces. There are also many materials related to restoring production in disaster areas and the daily necessities of disaster victims that need to be transferred. All provinces and regions must plan comprehensively and start early to ensure the needs of disaster victims.
　　12. The phenomenon of blind exodus of disaster victims should be stopped as soon as possible. The main thing is to strengthen disaster relief work in disaster areas. If the rescue is done well, it will be powerful to dissuade disaster victims from fleeing. At the same time, we must strengthen the ideological education of disaster victims. Individual people who do not engage in production and collude to flee should be stopped. All cities and industrial and mining areas should strictly implement the employment system, not allow private recruitment or arbitrarily absorb temporary workers, and mobilize and repatriate blind inflow personnel. The railway department should strictly check tickets and be responsible for handing over personnel flowing out without tickets to the nearest station for repatriation.
　　13. All localities should not only do a good job in disaster relief work but also combine it with the discussion of the draft National Agricultural Development Program, formulate specific plans that are in line with local conditions, carry out small-scale water conservancy construction, do a good job in soil and water conservation, strengthen afforestation, and strive to gradually reduce natural disasters to ensure the stability of agricultural production. Bumper harvest areas should also begin to store surplus grain for emergency needs.
　　According to the above decisions, all localities should study and implement them in light of their local conditions. The progress of disaster relief work in disaster-stricken provinces and regions must be reported to the Central Disaster Relief Committee every quarter in the future, and temporary major problems should be reported at any time.

　　国务院关于进一步做好救灾工作的决定
　　（一九五七年九月六日国务院全体会议第五十七次会议通过）
    今年7月以来，山东、河南、安徽、江苏、黑龙江、吉林等省的部分地区遭受了水灾，内蒙古、山西、陕西、江西、湖南等省的部分地区遭受了旱灾；广东省的部分地区遭受了台风灾。据目前情况看，在全国范围内灾情较1954、1956年为轻。但是在局部地区还是重的，救灾工作是艰巨的。为进一步做好救灾工作，现在决定如下：
    一、农业生产在我国社会主义建设事业中具有很大的重要性。农业为工业提供粮食与原料，农村是工业品的巨大市场。没有发达的农业，就不可能有发达的工业。像我们中国这样的国家，土地十分广阔，气温跨寒、温、亚热三带，局部的自然灾害是每年都有的。因此，从事农业生产不可避免地要同灾荒作斗争，才能得到发展。为此，各地不要孤立地去看救灾工作，应当把救灾工作看作发展农业生产的一个重要环节。同时，救灾工作也要通过发展农业生产来结合进行。今年特别是要通过今冬明春的农田水利建设和积肥运动来结合进行救灾。
    二、救灾工作的关键在于领导的重视。有灾各地应当把救灾工作摆在重要的地位，领导负责，全体动手，把得力干部派到重灾区去从始至终地负责指导工作，不到荒期结束，不轻易调动。对轻灾区也要经常派人下去检查。灾区的干部应当同群众密切联系，同甘共苦，严格防止官僚主义，及时掌握灾情和它可能发生的变化，采取措施解决问题。生产救灾委员会和它的办公室应当加强，各有关部门应当密切配合，以发挥一切救灾的潜在力量。
    三、巩固农业生产合作社是战胜灾荒的有力保证。农业生产合作社已经在抢救、补种阶段发挥了组织起来的优越作用，还要继续在救灾工作上发挥作用，并且通过救灾工作使合作社更加巩固。目前应当结合农村社会主义教育，开展大辩论，使灾民认识：依靠合作社战胜灾荒的优越性，同一切破坏合作社的坏分子作斗争，同时并且应当克服悲观、散伙、外逃等错误思想。
    四、灾区应当进行全面规划，逐社逐户安排。首先，核实灾情，做到实事求是，纠正夸大灾情的偏向。其次，安排生产，不仅要安排合作社的农业和副业生产，而且要安排家庭副业和自留地的生产。安排生产应当尽量同国家举办的农业基本建设工作结合起来，做到以工代赈。再次，安排灾民的生活，组织互助互济，或者由政府的农业贷款或救济费中给以帮助。由于经过了对每一灾民都负责任的全面规划，不但可以使政府做到心中有数，能够有计划地使用贷款、救济款，而且也可以使每一户灾民增加信心，鼓舞起生产的积极性。
    五、在水情仍很紧张的地区，应当做好护堤、抢险的工作，并且做好抢救灾民的各种准备，以便万一村落被水淹没的时候及早安全转移。已经集体转移的灾民，如家乡被淹短期不能返乡的，应当即在非灾区分散插社，但是不应过于集中。
    六、灾区应当掀起生产运动的高潮。加强受灾作物和晚秋作物的田间管理，积极准备冬麦的肥料和种子，适当扩大冬麦播种面积，保证做好种麦工作。凡能抢种蔬菜、荞麦、红薯的地方，应当抢种。有灾省、区的非灾地区，应当尽力争取超额增产，以丰补歉，支援灾区。今冬明春还应当开展防洪、防涝、防旱等各项水利建设工作，开展积肥工作，以掀起群众性的大生产运动。应当保护灾区的耕畜，用割草贮青和赶种谷草、转移牲畜等办法来解决饲草不足的困难。灾区还应当实行多种经营，开展集体副业和家庭副业生产。各省、自治区应当责成财经部门做好灾区副业生产的安排和组织工作，积极解决原料供应和产品推销问题，避免生产中的盲目性和商业投机活动。经常遭灾地区的农业社，应当建立比较经常的副业。
    七、对水灾地区的被毁房屋，农业生产合作社必须合理调配劳动力，利用旧料，因陋就简，在冬前迅速修复，但是也应当保证坚固安全。对于资金材料不足的分别情况酌给救济或者贷款。应当设法解决灾民烧柴的缺乏，并且提倡节约燃料。
    八、灾区应当防止疫病流行，纠正干部只重救灾疏于防疫的偏向，发动群众开展卫生运动，改善环境卫生，实行饮水消毒。并且组织中西医务人员深入灾区巡回治疗。
    九、救济款应当用在最需要的时候和必须救济的灾民身上，严防滥发，以免助长灾民依赖思想，减弱生产积极性。应当酌情降低救济标准，反对平均主义和发放不公的偏向。发放救济款的时候，应当同全社的逐户安排生产结合起来，实行民主评议，只对毫无生产能力或者虽生产自救还不能维持生活的灾民酌情救济，并且应当严格手续，公开账目，经常加以检查监督，以免发生浪费、贪污、挪用、发放不当等弊端。个体农民合于救济条件者，应当一视同仁。贷款应当视各农业社的情况分别发放，并且在非灾区做好归贷工作以支援灾区。
    十、灾区应当大力提倡节约，发动灾民搜集一切可供食用的代食品，禁止用粮食煮酒熬糖。对于送礼、请客等铺张浪费行为要加以纠正。有灾省、区在所属城市、工矿区和非灾农村也应当厉行节约，适当地降低粮食供应标准，以适应全省遭灾的情况。
    十一、今年有些灾区粮食减产很大，须从外省调运，还有很多有关恢复灾区生产和灾民日用必需的物资也需要调运，各省、区务须全盘计划，及早动手，以保证灾民需要。
    十二、灾民盲目外逃的现象应当及早制止。主要靠加强灾区救灾工作，救得好，劝阻灾民外逃就有力。同时，要加强灾民思想教育，对个别不事生产串连外逃的，应当努力制止。各城市和工矿区要严格执行用人制度，不许私自招工或者随意吸收临时工，对盲目流入人员要动员遣返。铁道部门要严格查票，对无票外流人员要负责交就近车站遣返。
    十三、各地不但要做好救灾工作，同时应当结合全国农业发展纲要草案的讨论，定出切合本地情况的具体规划，开展小型水利建设，做好水土保持工作，加强植树造林，争取逐步减少灾荒，以保证农业生产的稳定。丰收地区并且应当开始储积余粮，以备紧急时候的需要。
    根据以上各项决定，各地应当结合当地具体情况研究执行。有灾各省、区的救灾工作进行情况，今后务必于每季度向中央救灾委员会作一次报告，临时重大问题应当随时报告。
