Xinhua News Agency, London, September 5th: TASS reports that the Soviet representative to the UN Disarmament Subcommittee, Zorin, stated on September 5th in the subcommittee that the attitude of the Western countries participating in the disarmament negotiations is an obstacle to achieving even the smallest concrete progress in the negotiations and is leading the entire disarmament issue into a dead end.

　　He said that after studying the latest Western proposals, it has been confirmed that the Western delegations have not taken any real forward steps on the basic disarmament issues and continue to adhere to their original positions, which create new obstacles to reaching an understanding in the subcommittee.

　　Zorin pointed out that during the more than five months of discussions, the Soviet Union has continuously strived to bring the two sides' opinions closer and has tried to reach an agreement that both sides can agree on, guaranteeing the solution of basic disarmament issues; on the other hand, the Western countries have not taken any similar forward steps, they often delay and complicate the talks. Zorin said that the Western countries are undermining the possibility of passing a resolution on the immediate cessation of nuclear weapons tests.

　　Zorin said that the Soviet Union still advocates reaching a broad or at least a partial agreement on disarmament issues.

　　It is reported that at the meeting on the 5th, the British representative, Noble, suggested that the subcommittee adjourn, on the grounds that the subcommittee's work has not made progress recently, and that time is needed to study various issues due to the upcoming United Nations General Assembly. Other Western delegations supported this proposal.

　　The Soviet representative, Zorin, said that the Soviet delegation does not object to the subcommittee adjourning, because the subcommittee has not completed the tasks entrusted to it by the United Nations General Assembly. However, the disarmament issue, which is of concern to all countries, large and small, must be fully and thoroughly discussed at this session of the United Nations General Assembly.

　　However, some Western countries, especially the representative of the United States, want to avoid such a comprehensive discussion on the disarmament issue at the UN General Assembly, with the aim of evading their responsibility for undermining the five months of work of the subcommittee.

　　The Soviet representative firmly opposed this attempt to undermine the UN General Assembly's discussion of the disarmament issue. He requested that the subcommittee adjourn now, and that the question of how it will work in the future should be resolved after the UN General Assembly has comprehensively and fully discussed the disarmament issue.

　　At the request of the Western delegations, this issue was left to be discussed at the next meeting of the subcommittee.

    佐林指责西方把裁军问题引向死路
    主张本届联大充分讨论裁军问题
    据新华社6日讯　据塔斯社伦敦5日讯：出席联合国裁军小组委员会会议的苏联代表佐林9月5日在小组委员会中说，参加裁军谈判的西方国家的态度是使得谈判不能取得甚至最小的具体进展的一个障碍，并且正把整个裁军问题导向死路。
  他说，研究过西方的最新建议以后，已经证实这样一个结论：西方的代表团在基本的裁军问题上没有采取真正的前进步骤，并且继续坚持原来的立场，这种立场为在小组委员会中取得谅解制造了新的障碍。
    佐林指出，在五个多月的讨论过程中，苏联不断地努力使双方意见接近，并且设法达成一个双方都能同意的、保证解决基本裁军问题的协议；另一方面，西方国家远没有采取任何类似的前进步骤，它们常常拖延会谈并使会谈复杂化。佐林说，西方国家正在破坏通过一个关于立即停止核武器试验的决定的可能性。
    佐林说，苏联依然主张就裁军问题达成广泛的或至少是局部的协议。
    据悉，在5日会议上，英国代表诺布尔建议小组委员会休会，理由是小组委员会的工作近来没有进展，并且由于联合国大会即将开幕，需要时间来研究各项问题。其他西方代表团支持这项建议。
    苏联代表佐林说，苏联代表不反对小组委员会休会，因为小组委员会没有完成联合国大会交托给它的任务。但是，在这届联合国大会会议上必须对一切大小国家所关心的裁军问题进行全面充分的讨论。
    但是，某些西方国家，特别是美国的代表想避免在联大会议上就裁军问题进行这样的全面讨论，目的是想规避它们破坏小组委员会五个月的工作的责任。
    苏联代表坚决反对这种想破坏联大讨论裁军问题的企图，他要求小组委员会现在休会，至于它今后工作如何进行的问题，等到联大全面和充分地讨论了裁军问题以后再行解决。
    根据西方代表团的要求，这个问题留到小组委员会下次会议讨论。
