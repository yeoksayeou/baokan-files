    Mount Emei's Buddhist temples and buildings, known as "Emei, the Most Beautiful Place Under Heaven," have been renovated and newly built with government funding since liberation, and now have a brand new look, with scenery that is particularly beautiful and serene. The picture shows tourists viewing the spectacular "Sea of Clouds."
