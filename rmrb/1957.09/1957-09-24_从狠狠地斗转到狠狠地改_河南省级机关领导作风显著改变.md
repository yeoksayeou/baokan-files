From Fiercely Struggling to Fiercely Rectifying
Significant Changes in the Work Style of Henan Provincial-Level机关 Leaders

    (Report from Henan Daily) It is reported that the "rectification while correcting" work of the units under the Henan Provincial People's Committee has achieved remarkable results. Through the rectification campaign, the work style of leading cadres in many units has undergone significant changes, and they have begun to go deep into reality and among the masses in a planned way. Leading cadres in all units generally adhere to the system of participating in physical labor once a week; the Provincial Department of Industry and the Department of Transportation have dispatched more than 200 cadres to various special districts, counties, factories, and mines to gain in-depth understanding of the development of the increased production and conservation movement, and to help solve existing problems; leading cadres above the level of division and section chief and members of the Party committee of the Provincial Department of Culture have made specific divisions of labor and gone to various grassroots units to understand the situation and help solve problems. In line with the spirit of streamlining institutions and strengthening the grassroots, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Service Bureau have recently transferred 336 cadres to support newly built cities and industrial and mining areas. Many responsible cadres above the level of厅 and局长 have voluntarily implemented the system of not taking cars for non-official business. Many units have improved the management of canteens in机关, and resolved the problem of unreasonable housing allocation. Many units have announced the expenditure of employee welfare funds, and leading cadres who were previously unreasonably given relief funds have voluntarily returned the funds.
    Regarding the issues of cadre promotion and wage reform, various units are still carefully studying them.
    Currently, the leading groups of various units are conducting in-depth research on the reasonable but widely-ranging issues raised by everyone in accordance with the spirit of "fiercely struggling, fiercely rectifying," and are preparing to improve them in the next step. For those problems that should be changed but cannot be done temporarily, they are actively creating conditions to prepare for improvement. For opinions that are not reasonable enough, they are also explaining and clarifying them to the masses.

    从狠狠地斗转到狠狠地改
    河南省级机关领导作风显著改变
    本报讯　据河南日报消息：河南省人民委员会所属各单位，“边整边改”工作取得了显著成绩。通过整风，许多单位的领导干部作风有了显著转变，开始有计划地深入实际，深入群众。各单位的领导干部一般都坚持了每周参加一次体力劳动的制度；省工业厅、交通厅抽出二百多名干部，到各专县、厂矿深入了解增产节约运动开展情况，帮助解决存在的问题；省文化局处、科长以上干部和党委委员进行了具体分工，分别到各基层单位了解情况，帮助解决问题。省供销社、服务厅根据精简机构、充实下层的精神，最近抽调三百三十六名干部，支援了新建城市和工矿区。许多厅、局长以上的负责干部，都自动地执行了非因公外出不坐小汽车的制度。不少单位改进了机关食堂伙食管理，解决了住房分配不合理的问题。很多单位公布了职工福利费开支情况，过去救济不合理的领导干部都主动退回救济金。
    关于提拔干部和工资改革方面的问题，各单位还正在慎重研究。
    目前各单位领导小组，正在根据“狠狠地斗，狠狠地改”的精神，深入研究大家提出的合理的但牵连面广的问题，准备下一步进行改进。对那些应改而暂时办不到的问题，正积极创造条件准备改进。对于不够合理的意见，也向群众进行解释和说明。
