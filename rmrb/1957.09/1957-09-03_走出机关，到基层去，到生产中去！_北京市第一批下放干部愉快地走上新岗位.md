Leaving the Offices, Going to the Grassroots, Going into Production!
The First Group of Cadres Transferred from Beijing Happily Take Up New Positions

(Beijing Daily News) The General Office and Foreign Affairs Office of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, in accordance with the Municipal People's Committee's decision to streamline administrative organs and transfer staff to participate in production and grassroots work, have earnestly carried out streamlining efforts. The authorized staffing of these units has been reduced from the original 227 to 125, a reduction of 40%. Recently, these units transferred another 84 people to agricultural production cooperatives, handicraft production cooperatives, neighborhood committees, and other grassroots units to participate in production and work.

Yesterday morning, the General Office of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee and other units held a farewell meeting to send off the first group of colleagues who are leaving the offices to take up labor production and grassroots work positions. At the meeting, Vice Mayors Zhang Youyu, Wu Han, and Jia Tingsan, as well as Xue Fei, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Municipal People's Committee, delivered speeches. Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu said that this transfer of staff from government organs to the grassroots to participate in production and work is a revolutionary measure to strengthen and consolidate socialist construction and gradually combine mental and physical labor. By sending down staff, state organs can better understand the hardships of the people and represent the people more fully in terms of political, living, and ideological sentiments, and become more democratic. Representatives of the transferred staff expressed in their speeches that they would greet their new tasks with a fighting spirit and were determined to win victories on the socialist production front.

Of the 84 staff members transferred this time, 43 were assigned to agricultural production cooperatives in Xishan Township, Haidian District, one to a state-owned farm, 19 to handicraft production cooperatives, five to middle and primary schools, four to work in neighborhood committees, and the other twelve retired due to old age or were transferred to other units. Among them, there are 31 Communist Party members and 26 Communist Youth League members, including 15 cadres at the section chief level.

When streamlining staffing, these units conducted meticulous ideological mobilization among all staff members. Some people believed that participating in production at the grassroots had no "future," and even thought that doing so would "bury" the talents of cadres. However, after full discussion and enhanced ideological understanding, the vast majority of staff members dispelled their ideological concerns and realized that going down to participate in production or work with the working people was a good opportunity to temper and transform themselves.

The leaders of these units conducted careful research and made proper arrangements for the lives and work of the staff members who were decided to be transferred. They also solicited the opinions of the cadres themselves and assigned appropriate production and work positions based on work needs and individual preferences.

Currently, a wave of applications to participate in production or work at the grassroots has been set off among the staff of administrative organs, commercial, and industrial system units in Beijing. In the future, a large number of staff members will go to the grassroots to participate in production and work. (See photos)

    走出机关，到基层去，到生产中去！
    北京市第一批下放干部愉快地走上新岗位
    本报讯  据北京日报消息：北京市人民委员会办公厅、外事处等单位根据市人民委员会关于精简行政机构抽调机关工作人员参加生产和基层工作的决定，认真进行了精简。这几个单位的编制已由原来的二百二十七人，减到一百二十五人，精简了40％的人员。最近这几个单位又抽调八十四人分别下放到农业生产合作社、手工业生产合作社、街道居民委员会等基层去参加生产和工作。
    昨天上午，北京市人民委员会办公厅等单位举行欢送会，欢送第一批由机关走到劳动生产和基层工作岗位去的伙伴们。会上，张友渔、吴晗、贾庭三副市长和市人委机关党委副书记薛飞都讲了话。张友渔副市长说，这次抽调机关工作人员到基层去参加生产和工作，是增强和巩固社会主义建设，逐步把脑力劳动和体力劳动结合起来的革命措施。国家机关通过下放的工作人员，可以更加直接了解人民群众的疾苦，使国家机关能够更加从政治上、生活要求上、思想感情上代表人民，更加民主化。下放工作人员的代表在讲话中表示要以战斗的姿态迎接新的任务，决心在社会主义的生产战线上打胜仗。
    这次被抽调的八十四个工作人员中，分配到海淀区西山乡农业生产合作社的四十三人，分配到国营农场的一人，分配到手工业生产合作社的十九人，分配到中、小学工作的五人，去参加街道居民委员会工作的四人，其他还有老年退休或转到其他单位工作的十二人。在他们当中，有共产党员三十一人，共青团员二十六人，其中有十五个科长级的干部。
    这些单位在进行精简编制工作的时候，对全体工作人员都进行了细致的思想动员。有些人认为到基层去参加生产没有“前途”，甚至认为这样做会“埋没”干部的才能。但是，经过充分讨论，提高思想认识以后，绝大部分工作人员都消除了思想顾虑，并且认识到下去和劳动人民一起参加生产或工作，是锻炼和改造自己的好机会。
    这些单位的负责人对决定下放的工作人员的生活、工作都做了慎重的研究和妥善的安排。并征求了干部本人的意见，根据工作需要和个人志愿分配了适当的生产和工作岗位。
    目前，北京市各行政机关、商业和工业系统单位的工作人员，已经掀起了申请到基层去参加生产或工作的热潮，今后，将有大批工作人员到基层去参加生产和工作。（附图片）
