Large Number of Ancient Artifacts Unearthed in Beijing

The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture's Antiquities Survey and Research Group has recently unearthed a large number of ancient artifacts while cooperating with local construction projects.

During the construction of the Yongdingmen Railway Station, the antiquities group discovered ancient tomb complexes underground. After preliminary excavation and research, it was determined that they include Han tombs and Liao tombs. Han Dynasty Wu Zhu coins and some pottery were unearthed from the Han tombs. In the Liao tombs, carved brick tables and chairs were excavated. Remnants of colored murals were also found on the tomb walls, and the antiquities group has made rubbings or taken photographs of these blurred murals.

During the construction of the Yongding River water diversion project, the antiquities group unearthed more than 3,000 artifacts from prehistoric times up to the Ming and Qing dynasties. A fossilized deer antler and a fossilized ox skull unearthed at Yuyuantan have been preliminarily identified as belonging to the late Quaternary period, dating back approximately hundreds of thousands of years. This discovery provides favorable conditions for future searches for Paleolithic human remains in this area.

At the construction site from Moshikou to Xibianmen, the antiquities group also discovered many tombs of Ming Dynasty eunuchs, with remnants of epitaphs unearthed from the tombs. Among the burial items, a red gold inlaid dragon head belt hook and an exquisitely carved white jade belt were found. The discovery of these handicrafts provides new and valuable materials for the study of Ming Dynasty history.

　　北京出土大量古文物
    北京市文化局文物调查研究组，近来在配合当地各项建设工程时发掘出了大批古文物。
    在永定门火车站施工过程中，文物组在地下发现了古墓群。经初步发掘、研究，认定其中有汉墓、辽墓。在汉墓里出土了汉代的五铢钱和一些陶器。在辽墓里，发掘出雕砖制的桌椅。在墓壁上还残存着彩色壁画，文物组已将这些模糊不清的壁画临摹或拍摄了照片。
    文物组在永定河引水工程施工时，出土了史前直到明清时代的文物有三千多件。在玉渊潭出土的一个鹿角化石和一个牛头骨化石，据初步鉴定都是第四纪的晚期、距离现在约十几万年以前的遗体。这一出土线索，为今后在这个地区寻找旧石器时代人类的遗迹提供了有利条件。
    在模式口到西便门的工地上，文物组还发现了不少明代宦官的墓葬，在墓里出土了残余的墓志。在葬品中还找到了赤金镶嵌的龙头带钩和十分精美的透雕的白玉带。这些手工艺品的发现，对于研究明代历史是一批新的宝贵材料。
