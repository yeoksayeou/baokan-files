Big-Character Posters in Enterprises

	Come down and produce!

	The leadership talks incessantly about streamlining the organization, but in reality, the streamlining in our factory is just moving people from this department to that department, and from that department back to this department, shuffling them around. For example, the inspection department didn't have so many people in the past, and all the work could be completed. Why are so many people being added now? Is this streamlining or expansion? Looking at the workshop, there is often a shortage of people. When workers need to drink water or go to the toilet, there is no one to replace them. The leadership must know this, so why don't they solve it? Our entire group unanimously proposes transferring surplus personnel to the workshop to participate in production.

	Only Talk, No Action

	Our factory has a large organization and too many personnel. Some people have nothing to do during work hours, and just do arithmetic or read newspapers.

	Why doesn't the leadership pay attention to saving in this area? Why only ask the workers to economize and not tap the potential of the offices? Half a year ago, you proposed merging offices and streamlining personnel to put them into production at the section chiefs' meeting. Why hasn't this been done yet? Streamlining personnel is the biggest saving. We suggest the leadership take charge of this work!

	Robbing Peter to Pay Paul - Unattended Looms

	Loom No. 75 was newly test-run and hasn't been officially used yet, but the shuttle covers for two shuttles are missing. Overnight, one of the picking sticks of this machine was also lost. Machine No. 76 is completely missing two picking sticks, making it a handless person. Shuttle covers and picking sticks don't have wings or legs; they can't run or fly. How did they suddenly disappear? It turns out that a capable person who has always liked to use the "robbing Peter to pay Paul" method of work took them off to use on other machines. Can such a chaotic phenomenon of unattended management be allowed in a socialist enterprise?

	Are we always going to copy blindly?

	Our factory can be said to be a first-class factory in the national musical instrument production industry. However, the administration is only satisfied with the status quo and has not further considered how to improve further. First of all, take the drawings as an example. Until now, there is not even a dedicated draftsman. Even for the commonly made piccolo, we have to borrow a sample from the commercial department to make it. This not only creates difficulties for workshop production but, more importantly, affects our future development. Are we always going to copy blindly? Can't we ever produce according to certain specifications? We demand that the leadership use its greatest strength to develop product specifications and dimensions so that our products can truly meet international standards in terms of shape, quality, and sound.

    企业里的大字报
    下来生产吧！
    领导上口口声声叫精简机构，实际上咱厂的精简机构是由这科调到那科，由那科调到这科，来回的调动。如检验科过去没那么多人，一切工作都可以完成，现在为什么添那么多人呢？这到底是精简还是扩大呢？再看看车间，经常闹人荒，工人们要喝水或上厕所时，都没有人顶替，领导上不能不知道，可为什么不给解决呢？我们小组全体同志一致提出把多余人员调到车间参加生产。
  （公私合营仁立麻纺厂梳纺乙班小组）
    只说精简，不见行动
    我们厂的机构庞大，人员过多，有的人在工作时间没事作，就算算术、看报。
    领导上为什么不从这方面注意节约呢？为什么只让工人节约，不挖掘股室的潜力呢？半年前你们在股长会上提出合并股室，精简人员投入生产，为什么现在还不办呢？精简人员就是最大的节约；建议领导上把这件工作抓起来吧！
    （公私合营艺华乐器厂工人司岳）
    拆了东墙补西墙  无人管理的织布机
    七十五号织布机新试完车，还没正式使用，两根梭子的梭盖都没有了。过了一夜，这台车的打梭棒也丢了一只。七十六号车两只打梭棒全没有了，成了无手的人。梭子盖和打梭棒没有翅膀没有腿，不会跑也不能飞，怎么忽然不见了呢？原来一向喜欢采用“拆了东墙补西墙”工作方法的能手，把它们拆到别的车上用去了。这种无人管理的混乱现象，在社会主义企业里能允许吗？
    （公私合营仁立麻纺厂职员徐增厚）
    难道永远照猫画虎吗？
    我们厂在全国乐器生产这一行里，可以说是第一流的厂子了。但是，行政只满足这个现状，没有进一步考虑如何再提高。首先拿图纸来说，直到现在连个专门绘图的人都没有。连经常做的短笛，都要到商业部门去借一个样子回来才能做。这样，不仅给车间生产造成困难，更重要的是影响我们今后的发展。难道我们永远照猫画虎吗？我们就永远不能按照一定规格生产吗？我们要求领导上用最大的力量把产品规格尺寸搞起来，使我们的产品能够从形、质、音上真正的达到国际标准。（公私合营艺华乐器厂工段长纪世邦）
