Xinhua News Agency: Liaoning Province's Commercial Department determined at a meeting of commercial bureau (section) chiefs from various cities and counties (banners) held from the 10th to the 16th that the supply of peak season goods must prioritize meeting the needs of rural areas to ensure the completion of the state's agricultural product procurement tasks.

The meeting believed that, judging from the current situation, the urban and rural markets in Liaoning Province will be normally prosperous in the second half of the year, and social purchasing power will not increase significantly. The inventory of most daily-use merchandise is sufficient in the second half of the year, and the supply of most means of production is also balanced. At the same time, this year's agricultural product procurement task is very large. Therefore, during the rural market peak season from November this year to February next year, commodities needed by both urban and rural areas, such as white cloth, dyed coarse cloth, large floral flannel, fleece sweaters and pants, coarse wool yarn, low-grade towels, bamboo-shell thermos bottles, flashlights, coarse leather goods, and round-toe shoes, must be given priority for supply to rural areas.

Liaoning Province has many cities with a large proportion of purchasing power, and the stability of the urban market is related to the stability of the entire province's market. Therefore, the meeting believed that under normal circumstances, it is also very important to do a good job in urban supply.

    辽宁确定旺季物资优先供应农村
    据新华社讯　旺季物资供应必须优先满足农村需要，以保证国家农产品采购任务的完成。这是辽宁省商业厅在10日到16日召开的各市、县（旗）商业局（科）长会议上确定的。
    会议认为，从目前许多情况看来，辽宁省下半年城乡市场将正常繁荣，社会购买力不会有大幅度增加；下半年多数日用百货商品的储存是充足的，大部分生产资料也供应平衡。同时，今年农产品收购任务很大。因此，今年11月到明年2月农村市场旺季中，对城乡都需要的商品，如白布、染色粗布，大花贡呢、绒衣裤、粗毛线、低档毛巾、竹壳水瓶、电筒、粗皮货、大头鞋等日用工业品，必须优先供应农村。
    辽宁省城市多，购买力比重大，城市市场稳定与否，关系着全省市场的稳定，因此会议认为，在正常情况下，把城市供应工作做好也是十分重要的。
