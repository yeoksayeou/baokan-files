Stage and Screen

    An Unusual Story
    The Soviet film "The Rumyantsev Case" received great honors at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in 1956. The film tells an unusual story: a young truck driver meets his beloved girl, Klavdia, in extraordinary circumstances. Just as he is beginning to taste the sweetness of love, terrible disaster strikes—speculators and bad elements collude to use him to transport contraband; but finally, with the help of public security officers, he clears his name and regains his freedom and happiness. The film is attractive not only because of its twists and turns, but also because of the richness and breadth of the social life it reflects. It not only ruthlessly exposes the viciousness of bad elements and speculators, and the shameful behavior of those so-called "self-preservationists" who, for fear of being implicated in the Rumyantsev case, do not hesitate to betray their friends; more importantly, it allows us to touch the noble hearts of many Soviet people: the indomitable will of the young Soviet generation in their struggle and life, and the unparalleled concern of Soviet public security officers for the fate of ordinary people. The film is also extremely successful in character development. Rumyantsev's heroic image and optimistic spirit; Colonel Afanasyev, the public security officer's wise and profound eyes, his high vigilance in the face of the enemy, and his kindness and rigor towards his comrades, are all deeply imprinted in our hearts, making us unable to forget them for a long time.

    Satirical Comedy "So Affectionate"
    The satirical comedy "So Affectionate" whips those who have incorrect attitudes toward life and love, are greedy for pleasure, and are vain. The female lead, Fu Ping, falls in love with several people at the same time, including college student Huang Shan, film industry worker Bai Lang, and Section Chief Fei from a certain agency. However, she is not satisfied with any of them because she loves not people, but positions. In the end, she falls in love with a "Director." When she is fantasizing about her future luxurious life, her fantasy is shattered. It turns out that person is not a director at all.
    The handling of the scene in the film where Fu Ping and Section Chief Fei encounter Huang Shan and Bai Lang in the department store and panic is quite interesting. The film's depiction of the three people abandoned by Fu Ping is relatively concise, while she makes a complete fool of herself in the process of falling in love with "Director Li." This treatment is clear in its priorities. The actors also have a good grasp of their respective roles. (Jia Jin)

    Gengsheng Pingju Troupe Performs "White Lotus"
    Recently, the Beijing Gengsheng Pingju Troupe performed "White Lotus," a mythological drama adapted from Henan Opera.
    The story of "White Lotus" describes a fairy living inside a white lotus who, because she admires the hardworking young man Chao Ben, marries him through the introduction of the White Lotus Boy. Chao Ben's family is poor and owes the landlord money that they cannot repay. The White Lotus Fairy devises a plan to steal silver to pay off the debt, but the silver is recognized by the government as stolen, causing a storm. The White Lotus Fairy then uses a "gentle breeze fan" to sweep away all the evil forces, and finally lives a free and happy life with Chao Ben.
    Due to the appropriate use of stage art design in the performance, the strengthening of the treatment of music and dance, and the moving images of the main characters, the mythological atmosphere of "White Lotus" is quite strong.

    一个不平常的故事
    苏联影片“鲁勉柴夫案件”曾经在1956年卡罗维·发利国际电影节上获得很大的荣誉。影片描述了一个不平常的故事：青年汽车司机在不平凡的境遇中认识了自己心爱的姑娘克拉夫吉亚。当他正初次啜饮着爱情的蜜汁的时候，可怕的灾祸却降临到他的头上——投机商人和坏分子勾结，利用他贩运私货；但是终于因为公安人员的帮助，他洗去了不白之冤，重新获得了自由和幸福。影片吸引人的地方，不仅在于故事的曲折有致，而更在于它所反映的社会生活的丰富和宽广。它不仅无情地揭露了坏分子和投机商人的毒辣阴狠，以及那些所谓“明哲保身”的人，因为害怕鲁勉柴夫案件牵涉到自己，不惜出卖朋友的行为的可耻；更重要的是，它让我们触摸到众多的苏维埃人的崇高的心灵：苏联年青一代在斗争生活中的昂扬不屈的意志，苏联公安人员对于普通人的命运的无比关怀。影片在人物造型方面也是极为出色的。鲁勉柴夫的英气勃勃的形象和乐观精神；公安人员阿发纳谢夫上校的明智深邃的眼光，他在敌人面前的高度警惕，他对同志的宽和和谨严，都深深印在我们心头，使我们长久不能忘怀。（方）
    讽刺喜剧片“如此多情”
    “如此多情”这部讽刺喜剧片，对于对生活和恋爱观抱有不正确态度、贪图享受、爱慕虚荣的人进行了鞭策。女主角傅萍在同一个时间内爱上了几个人，有大学生黄山，有电影从业员白浪，也有某机关的费科长。但是她都不满意，因为她爱的不是人，是职位。最后她终于爱上一位“处长”。当她幻想着未来的阔绰生活的时候，她的幻想却破灭了。原来那个人根本不是处长。
    影片中傅萍与费科长在百货公司遇上了黄山和白浪的一个惊慌场面的处理是比较有趣的。影片对于傅萍所遗弃的三个人的描写比较简洁，而在和“黎处长”的恋爱过程中她却丑态百出了。这样处理是主次分明的。几个演员对各自角色的掌握也还有分寸。（家锦）
    更生评剧团上演“白莲花”
    最近，北京更生评剧团演出了“白莲花”，这是一出根据豫剧改编的神话剧。
    “白莲花”的故事，是描写一个住在白莲花内的仙子，因为爱慕热爱劳动的青年朝本，通过白莲童的引见而结成了夫妻。朝本家庭贫苦，欠地主的钱无力偿还，经白莲仙子设法盗银替他还了债，但银子被官府认出是盗来而起了一场风波，白莲仙子就用“清风扇”扫除了一切恶势力，终于和朝本过着自由幸福的生活。
    由于演出中适当地运用了舞台美术的设计，加强了对音乐、舞蹈的处理，主要角色的形象也很动人，使“白莲花”的神话气息相当浓厚。
