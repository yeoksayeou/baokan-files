In the 1956-1957 grain year, over 42 billion jin of grain were sold in cities and towns across the country, guaranteeing the food supply for approximately 100 million residents, maintaining stable grain prices, and powerfully supporting national economic construction. However, this year saw a sale of 5.9 billion jin more grain than the previous year, of which 1.5 to 2 billion jin were unnecessarily sold due to excessively high grain consumption standards in some towns or among some residents in towns.

In a situation where the nation's grain supply is not abundant, the phenomenon of excessively generous urban grain supply and sales must be resolutely changed. The amount of grain needed by cities is very large, accounting for more than half of the grain purchased by the state. If the urban supply increases unreasonably, it will affect the balance of the national grain purchase and sales plan. In this case, the state would be forced to purchase too much grain from farmers, or forced to reduce export supplies, or reduce state reserves. In the previous year, the state maintained a stable grain situation by reducing reserves. Whichever method is adopted, it will affect the long-term interests of the country and the people. Therefore, the grain supply in all cities must be strictly controlled: on the one hand, ensuring reasonable needs, and on the other hand, plugging loopholes in the supply, vigorously promoting thrift, and opposing waste.

Some people say that cities have already implemented a system of rationed supply, and the rationing work was rectified in various places last winter and this spring; the ration supply standard for residents has been reduced by two jin in some areas, and at least half a jin or twelve liang in the smallest cases, so the urban supply can no longer be compressed. This idea is incorrect. The Ministry of Food recently investigated the grain supply situation in 67 large and medium-sized cities. In the rice-staple food areas, the ration supply level in some towns is around 24 jin, while others are as high as 27 or 28 jin, and individual cases exceed 29 jin. In the wheat flour and coarse grain-staple food areas, the ration supply level in some towns is around 28 jin, while others are as high as 30 jin or 31 jin, and individual cases even exceed 31 jin. Although there may be reasonable differences in the resident's grain consumption level between regions due to different economic conditions and consumption habits in various places. However, according to investigations, there is indeed a phenomenon of grain waste in many areas and among some residents in certain cities. Take Beijing as an example. In the recent two months, spot checks were conducted on 406 catering units, of which 218 units did not pay attention to saving grain, the food management system was lax, and there were phenomena of under-reporting when not lacking, over-reporting when lacking, falsely reporting and fraudulently receiving, and surplus grain. This phenomenon is also common in other regions.

Others believe that although the supply level for some urban residents can be compressed by half a jin, one jin, or even two jin, the quantity is not large. This idea is also incorrect. China has a large urban population and a large amount of grain consumption. If each person consumes or saves one or two jin more per month, the national annual amount will be more than ten or twenty billion jin. If such a huge amount of grain is used for other purposes (rural markets, export supplies, and national reserve accumulation), it will have a significant impact on the development of industrial and agricultural production and the stability of the national grain situation.

Urban grain conservation not only has great economic significance, but also great political significance. Since our country implemented the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and agricultural collectivization, many right-wing elements who oppose socialism have constantly used various methods to provoke the relationship between the working class and the peasant class, exaggerating some long-standing differences in the lives of workers and peasants into a chasm between heaven and hell. Ordinary farmers, not understanding the actual situation, will also believe it to be true and become suspicious of the policies of the Party and the government. If this psychological obstacle is not removed, it will affect the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance. In this situation, the development of the urban grain conservation movement, the appropriate compression of the unified sales volume, and the appropriate reduction of the excessively high supply standards for some residents will enable farmers to further eliminate misunderstandings, unite closely with urban residents, and work together to save grain. In this way, the worker-peasant alliance will be even more consolidated.

Cities have always had a higher standard of living and consume more grain. Now, if they are asked to reduce grain consumption, will they not complain about the Party and the government? We believe that: first, saving grain will not lower the living standards of urban people. Since the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain a few years ago, urban people have not been starving or lacking food. Now, compressing sales is only compressing the wasted parts of the past, not compressing the essential rations. How can this lower living standards? Second, after liberation, the People's Government ended the situation before liberation where grain prices rose several times a day, grain merchants hoarded and speculated, and people lacked grain, stabilizing people's lives. Based on their own experiences over the past few years, the broad masses of people deeply recognize that the national grain policy is completely correct and beneficial to the people. As long as we clearly explain to the broad masses of people the political and economic significance of saving grain for building the motherland and further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, urban residents will definitely actively support and implement the call to save grain.

In fact, as long as we make subjective efforts, we will definitely achieve results. For example, since Liaoning Province took active measures to tighten urban grain supply from December last year, the total urban grain supply has decreased by 15.5% by June of this year. Fushun City organized housewives to save grain, and the city saved a total of 1,899,900 jin of grain from February to July this year. According to statistics from 41 cities and counties in Jilin Province and the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, the rectification of grain unified sales work in towns and the compression of unreasonable consumption has resulted in a total grain sales volume that is 3,460 tons lower than before. Among them, after 20 towns and cities verified the population, the grain supply for more than 27,000 people was reduced. There are many such situations in other regions as well. Their general experience is to go deep into the residents, calculate together with the residents, and mobilize the masses to find ways to save grain. Wherever this has been done, the results have been very good.

These facts show that the potential for saving grain in towns and cities is still very large. In the future, on the principle of ensuring basic needs, urban sales should be appropriately controlled, and it should be determined that the standard of resident's grain rations will no longer increase, and the supply level should be stabilized. In areas where the supply is too generous and the standards are too high (or only some residents have standards that are too high), appropriate compression should be made. At the same time, the grain departments in towns and cities should further improve the rationed supply system, strictly control the number of people supplied, supply standards, and supply levels, control supply plans from top to bottom, strengthen the management of grain consumption by collective catering units, and adhere to the system of supplying grain to transient populations based on grain coupons. The grain consumption of industrial and commercial sectors should also be maintained at the current supply level. Except for necessary adjustments between regions and industries, the targets should generally not be increased. The grain work departments in towns and cities should actively promote the mass line method of work, rely on the political enthusiasm of the people to do a good job in the unified sales of grain, and save every grain that can be saved for the country.

### 城市用粮必须努力减少

    城市用粮必须努力减少
    在1956—1957粮食年度中，全国市镇销售粮食四百二十多亿斤，保证了一亿左右居民的食粮，保持了粮食价格的稳定，有力地支援了国家经济建设。但是，这一年度较上一年度多销了五十九亿斤粮食，其中有十五亿斤到二十亿斤是不应该多销而多销了的，原因是有的城镇或城镇中一部分居民吃粮的标准过高。
    在全国粮食并不充裕的情况下，城市粮食供应偏宽、销售过多的现象必须坚决改变。城市需要的粮食，数量很大，约占国家征购粮食半数以上。如果城市供应不合理地增多了，就会影响全国粮食收销计划的平衡。在这种情况下，国家就不得不被迫地向农民过多地收购粮食，或者不得不被迫地减少出口供应，或者减少国家库存。上一年度，国家是以减少库存的办法求得粮食局势平稳的。不管采取以上那种办法，都将影响国家和人民的长远利益。因此，所有城市的粮食供应必须严格控制：一方面要保证合理的需要，一方面也必须堵塞供应中的漏洞，大力提倡节约，反对浪费。
    有些人说，城市已经实行了定量供应，去冬今春各地又已经整顿了定量工作；对于居民口粮供应标准，有的地区压缩了二斤，最少的也压缩了半斤或者十二两，因此城市供应已经再也不能压缩了。这种想法是不正确的。粮食部前些日子调查了六十七个大中城市的粮食供应情况。在大米主食区，有的市镇的口粮供应水平是二十四斤左右，有的却高达二十七、八斤，个别的还超过二十九斤。在面粉杂粮主食区，有的市镇的口粮供应水平是二十八斤左右，有的却高达三十斤、三十一斤，个别的竟有超过三十一斤的。虽然，由于各地经济条件和消费习惯不同，地区之间的居民口粮消费水平是可以有合理的差别。但是，据调查，不少地区和某些城市的部分居民确实有浪费粮食的现象。以北京市为例。最近两个月抽查了四百零六个伙食单位，其中就有二百十八个单位不重视节约粮食，伙食管理制度松弛，存在有不缺报缺、缺少报多、虚报冒领、粮食有余的现象。这种现象，在其他地区也不少。
    还有人以为，一部分市民的供应水平虽然可以压缩半斤、一斤甚至二斤，但数量不大。这种想法也是不正确的。我国市镇人口多，用粮数量大，每人每月多用或者节约一斤、二斤，全国全年的数量就是十多亿或二十多亿斤。如果将这样巨大数量的粮食用之于其他方面（农村市场、出口供应和国家库存积累），对于工农业生产的发展和稳定全国粮食局势，都会发生重要的影响。
    城市节约用粮不仅有很大的经济意义，而且有很大的政治意义。自从我们国家实行粮食统购统销和农业合作化以来，许多反对社会主义的右派分子不断地用各种方法挑拨工人阶级和农民阶级的关系，加油添醋地把工农生活上一些历来存在的差别夸大成为天堂和地狱般的悬殊。一般农民不了解实际情况，也就会信以为真，对党和政府的政策发生怀疑。这种心理上的障碍不加破除，那就会影响工农联盟的巩固。在这种情形下，城市节约粮食运动的开展，统销数量的适当压缩和部分居民偏高的供应标准的适当降低，将使农民进一步消除误解，与市民亲密团结，共同努力节约粮食。这样，工农联盟就将更加巩固。
    城市历来生活水平较高，消费粮食较多，现在让他们降低粮食消费量，他们不会埋怨党和政府么？我们认为：第一，节约用粮并不会降低城市人民生活水平。实行粮食统销几年来，城市人民并没有什么忍饥挨饿不够吃的。现在压缩销量，也只是压缩过去浪费了的部分，并不是压缩必不可少的口粮。这怎么能降低生活水平呢？第二，解放以后，人民政府结束了解放以前粮价一日数涨、粮商囤积投机、人民粮食不足的局面，安定了人民的生活。广大群众根据几年来自己的切身经验，深刻地认识到国家粮食政策是完全正确的，对人民有利的。只要我们向广大人民群众说清楚了节约粮食对于建设祖国和进一步巩固工农联盟的政治和经济意义，城市居民就一定会积极地支持和执行节约粮食的号召。
    事实上，只要我们主观努力，就一定能够收到成效。比如，辽宁省从去年12月份采取积极措施紧缩城市粮食供应以来，到今年6月份，城市粮食总供应量比原来的下降15.5％。抚顺市组织家庭主妇节约粮食，全市从今年2月到7月，共节约粮食一百八十九万九千多斤。吉林省四十一个市县和延边朝鲜族自治州统计，市镇整顿粮食统销工作和压缩不合理消费的结果，已使粮食总销量比原来的下降三千四百六十多吨。其中二十个市镇查实人口以后，减少了二万七千多人的粮食供应。其他地区，也有许多这样的情况。他们的普遍经验，是深入到居民中去，与居民共同计算，发动群众想办法节约粮食。凡是这样做了的，收效都很好。
    这些事实说明，市镇方面节约粮食的潜力还很大。今后应当在保证基本需要的原则下，适当控制城市销量，并且确定居民口粮定量标准不再增加，把供应水平稳定下来。在供应过宽和标准过高（或只有部分居民标准偏高）的地区，应作适当的压缩。同时，市镇粮食部门还应当进一步健全定量供应制度，严格掌握供应人数、供应标准和供应水平，自上而下地控制供应计划，加强对集体伙食单位的用粮管理，坚持流动人口凭粮票供应粮食的制度。对于工商行业用粮，也应当维持在目前的供应水平。除了在地区间和行业间可以作必要的调整外，一般的不应提高指标。市镇粮食工作部门应该积极地推行群众路线的工作方法，依靠人民群众的政治积极性来做好粮食统销工作，为国家节省每一粒能够节省的粮食。
