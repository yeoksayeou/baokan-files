    So That's How It Is
    Qian Fang
    Rightist element of the Ministry of Agriculture, Zeng Xianpu, once clamored loudly that he "had the position but not the power," shouting "laymen cannot lead experts," causing a temporary foul atmosphere, acting as if it were very serious. What is the truth? Let’s read the following to get a glimpse of it.
    As the Deputy Director of the Economic Crops Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture, this spring in May when the National Vegetable Conference was held (his responsible business), he abandoned the conference and didn't attend. He didn't listen to important reports, but instead went to the park leisurely. This kind of thing is not just one instance. In February 1955, he went to Jiangsu Province to attend the Sericulture Conference. Before the conference was over, he went to Shanghai to play, see his younger siblings, and buy yarn in the name of visiting a fruit processing factory. The Party and the state gave him such a great responsibility, but he was irresponsible and derelict in his duty. On the contrary, he said that he had the position but not the power.
    This June, when the Japanese Michurin Society visited China, the Chinese Horticultural Society invited them and Chinese experts to have a discussion on fruit tree and vegetable issues. Zeng was the chairman of the Horticultural Society, and the meeting should have been presided over by him. He declined to go, and the meeting had to be temporarily hosted by a translator, but he hid in another room to host the "Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Symposium" to attack the Party, disregarding international diplomatic influence, and enthusiastic about conspiratorial activities.
    Zeng Xianpu usually said he had "high blood pressure" and often claimed to be sick and didn't go to work, but during the blooming and contending stage, he disregarded his hard work day and night and went around to ignite and incite.
    Is Zeng Xianpu really "having the position but not the power", or is he derelict, negligent, and irresponsible?
    Let's take a look at the true face of his so-called "laymen cannot lead experts": After Zeng Xianpu returned from studying in the UK in 1936, nominally studying horticulture, he never touched the actual practice, never did a field test, and never published a paper. In the eight years after liberation, he did not write a single technical guiding instruction or article. Usually, in order to cover up his "emptiness" and "layman" status, he never dared to express his opinion first. When a manuscript was sent to him for review, he always said "study it, study it". Hanging the titles of "British returned student", "professor", and "fruit tree and horticulture expert", shouting "laymen cannot lead experts" and attempting to drive the Communist Party off the stage, Zeng Xianpu himself turned out to be a "layman".
    The magic trick of the rightists has been exposed, that’s all it is.

    原来如此
    前方
    农业部右派分子曾宪朴曾大嚷大叫自己“有职无权”，高喊“外行不能领导内行”，一时弄得乌烟瘴气，煞有介事。真象如何？且看下文，便可略知一二。
    曾身为农业部经济作物局副局长，今春5月开全国蔬菜会议（是他的主管业务）他丢开会议不去参加，重要的报告不听，而却逍遥自在地逛公园去了。这样的事不只一桩，1955年2月去江苏省参加蚕桑会议，会议尚未结束就以看果品加工厂为名，去上海玩耍，看弟妹和买毛线去了。党和国家交给他这样大的责任，他不负责，不尽职，反而说自己有职无权。
    今年6月，日本米丘林学会访问中国时，中国园艺学会约他们和中国专家一起座谈果树蔬菜问题，曾是园艺学会的理事长，会议理应由他主持，他推辞不去，临时只好由翻译主持，但他却躲在另一房间主持向党进攻的“农林水座谈会”，不顾国际外交影响，热中于阴谋活动。
    曾宪朴平时说“血压高”，常常称病不上班，但在鸣放阶段，却不顾日夜辛劳，各方奔走去点火煽风。
    曾宪朴到底是“有职无权”，还是失职、渎职、不尽责任呢？
    再看看他的所谓“外行不能领导内行”的真面目：曾宪朴于1936年从英国留学回国后，名义上是学园艺的，但根本不去接触实际，从未作过一次田间试验，没有发表过一篇论文；解放后八年来，也没写过一篇技术指导性的指示或文章。平时在工作中为了掩盖自己的“空虚”和“外行”，从不肯先发表意见，送文稿请他看，他总是说“研究研究”。挂着“英国留学生”“教授”“果树园艺专家”头衔，口口声声喊着“外行不能领导内行”，企图要赶共产党下台的曾宪朴，他本人原来就是个“外行”。
    把右派分子的西洋镜揭穿了，不过如此。
