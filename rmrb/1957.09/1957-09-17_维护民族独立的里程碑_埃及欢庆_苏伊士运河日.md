Xinhua News Agency, Ismailia, 14th: Approximately 10,000 Egyptians grandly celebrated "Suez Canal Day" here tonight. President Nasser's representative, Sabri, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Egypt also attended the celebration.

On this day last year, the Western countries' pilots collectively resigned in an attempt to paralyze canal traffic, but the Egyptian authorities successfully maintained the navigation of the canal, proving that Egypt was fully capable of managing the canal. The Egyptian authorities now designate this day as "Suez Canal Day."

Mahmoud Younis, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Suez Canal Authority, announced in his speech at the celebration that the Suez Canal will be open to ships with a draft of thirty-five feet in January next year, restoring it to the situation before the tripartite aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel.

Younis said that the foreign pilots' resignation on this day last year was intended to hinder navigation. However, the determination of the Egyptian people defeated their conspiracy. Today, canal traffic is even busier, with an average of forty-seven ships passing through the canal every day since September, compared to thirty-nine point six ships in the same period in 1955. He said that no passing ship was delayed in the past year, while in the previous year, as many as five hundred and ninety-seven ships were delayed.

He said that before the nationalization of the canal, there were two hundred and five pilots, of which only forty were Egyptians, while today there are a total of two hundred and twenty-two pilots, of which one hundred are Egyptians.

All day today, people have been flocking to Ismailia from Cairo. All the hotels in the city are fully booked. Tonight, the whole city is brightly lit. The celebrations here will continue until September 15. In the capital, Cairo, there were also grand celebrations on the evening of September 14.

　　埃及欢庆“苏伊士运河日”
    据新华社伊士美利亚14日电  约有一万埃及人今晚在这里盛大庆祝“苏伊士运河日”。纳赛尔总统的代表萨布里和各国驻埃及外交使节也参加了这个庆祝会。
    去年今天，西方国家的引水员集体辞职，以图使运河交通瘫痪，但是埃及当局成功地维持了运河的航行，证明埃及完全有能力管理运河。埃及当局现在规定这一天为“苏伊士运河日”。
    苏伊士运河管理局董事会董事长马哈茂德·尤尼斯在庆祝会上讲话时宣布，苏伊士运河在明年1月将向吃水三十五英尺的船只开放，恢复到英、法、以色列三国侵略埃及战争以前的情况。
    尤尼斯说，去年今天外国引水员离职的目的是要妨碍航行。但是埃及人的决心击败了他们的阴谋。今天运河的通航更为繁忙，9月份以来平均每天通过运河的船只是四十七艘，而1955年同期是三十九点六艘。他说，在过去的一年中没有一艘通过的船只被延误，而在前年，被延误的船只达五百九十七艘。
    他说，在运河国有化之前，有二百零五名引水员，其中只有四十名埃及人，而今天共有二百二十二名引水员，其中有埃及人一百名。
    今天一整天，一直有人从开罗拥到伊士美利亚来。这个城里的所有旅馆都告客满。今天晚上，全城灯火辉煌。这里的庆祝活动将继续到9月15日。在首都开罗，9月14日晚间，也有盛大庆祝。
