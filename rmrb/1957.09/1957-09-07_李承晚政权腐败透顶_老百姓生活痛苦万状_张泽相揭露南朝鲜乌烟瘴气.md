Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 6th: According to a "Rodong Sinmun" report on the 5th, Chang Taek-sang, a South Korean National Assembly member and independent, published an article in the South Korean magazine "New Sun" in July, exposing the dark politics of the Syngman Rhee clique and the suffering of the South Korean people.

Chang Taek-sang, who once served as Prime Minister of the Syngman Rhee government, began his article by saying that the lives of the South Korean people were already very difficult last year, but have further deteriorated this year. At present, small and medium-sized enterprises in South Korea are closing down one after another, and the number of unemployed has reached three million and continues to spread like a flood. The number of grain-deficient farmers has reached two million, and they are surviving on grass roots and tree bark. Many urban residents are also filling their stomachs with tofu dregs and chaff.

The article states that today in South Korea, "overall national administration" is left to Syngman Rhee to manipulate at will. The "chiefs" under Syngman Rhee are all mediocre people living around him. Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party is a "group of politicians and businessmen" whose goal is to compete for power and make money. The article says that the regime controlled by the Liberal Party is like a sharp blade in the hands of a madman, which may be swung anywhere and may bring danger to the people.

The article exposes the corruption of officials in the Syngman Rhee regime. The article says that South Korea's "national budget" and "imported goods" are subjected to "the upper levels of the Syngman Rhee group sucking blood, the middle levels eating meat, and the lower levels simply stealing what's left, resulting in nothing being accomplished." The article says that cadres of the Liberal Party use a business card to borrow billions of won from banks, and then never repay a cent.

    李承晚政权腐败透顶  老百姓生活痛苦万状
    张泽相揭露南朝鲜乌烟瘴气
    据新华社平壤6日电　据“劳动新闻”5日报道，南朝鲜国会议员、无党派人士张泽相在南朝鲜的“新太阳”杂志7月号上发表了一篇文章，暴露了李承晚集团的黑暗政治和南朝鲜人民的痛苦生活。
    曾经一度担任过李承晚政府国务总理的张泽相的文章开头说，南朝鲜人民去年的生活已经十分困苦，可是这一年来又进一步恶化。目前，南朝鲜的中、小企业纷纷倒闭了，失业者达到了三百万，并且像洪水一样继续泛滥着。断粮农户已达到二百万户，他们以草根树皮维持生命，城市居民也有很多以豆腐渣和糟糠充饥。
    文章说，今天南朝鲜的“全盘国政”是听凭李承晚一人随意操纵的，李承晚手下的“长官”都是在李承晚周围庸庸碌碌谋生活的人。李承晚的自由党是“政客和商人的集团”，他们的目标是争夺权力和发财。文章说，由自由党所掌握的政权就像是疯人手中的利刃，它说不定要向那里挥动，也说不定会给人们带来什么危险。
    文章揭露了李承晚政权中的官员贪污腐败的情形。文章说，南朝鲜的“国家预算”和“进口物资”都被李承晚集团“上层吸血，中层吃肉，下层把剩下来的干脆偷走，结果是无一成就”。文章说，自由党的干部拿一张名片就到银行借款数十亿圜，以后分文不还。
