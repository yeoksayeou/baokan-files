Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, September 1st: The struggle against bourgeois right-wing elements has been launched successively in organs, organizations, and schools at the prefectural and autonomous prefecture levels in Guizhou Province. The right-wing elements in these organs, organizations, and schools are being exposed one after another.

In the cultural and educational circles of the Anshun Prefecture, meetings have been held continuously since July to carry out reasoning and struggle against Wu Chao, a teacher at Anshun Normal School and a right-wing element. During the period of the Great Blooming and Great Contending, he slandered the Communist Party's policy toward intellectuals as "labeling" and "clubbing"; and said that today the Communist Party "appoints fools." He openly clamored for the Communist Party secretary-principal of Anshun Normal School to step down.

After the anti-rightist struggle was launched in the organs of the Zunyi Prefecture, several sinister right-wing cliques have been exposed. The seven-member right-wing clique headed by Wang Qihai and Luo Zhengkai, which was exposed in the central branch of the People's Bank and the Zunyi City branch, held secret meetings four times during the period of the Great Blooming and Great Contending, deciding to go to various places to incite and instigate backward students to take to the streets and demonstrate against the Communist Party. After the counterattack against the right-wing struggle was launched, the ugly faces of these seven right-wing elements were exposed.

Qiu Lianbai, vice chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce of the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, incited industrialists and businessmen to withdraw from joint state-private enterprises during the period of the Great Blooming and Great Contending, clamoring for the removal of the public representatives of the joint state-private enterprises, attempting to restore capitalism. Now, the industrial and commercial circles of this prefecture have launched a reasoning struggle against Qiu Lianbai, exposing and refuting his anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and deeds.

Jin Shuliang, president of Northeast Institute of Technology, adhered to the socialist stance and stepped forward courageously during the period of the Great Blooming and Great Contending, effectively counterattacking the rampant attacks of the right-wing elements.

Once, right-wing elements in the school prepared to establish an illegal organization above the administration and the Party, coercing him to agree. Jin Shuliang refuted, "This is an action to abolish the leadership of the Party, I completely disagree." Right-wing elements also incited students of the mining and electromechanical engineering department to oppose graduation design. Jin Shuliang carried out an unyielding struggle against this erroneous action that violated the Party's educational policy, and educated and persuaded the students who were used by the right-wing elements.

    步步深入  层层挖掘
    贵州省反右派斗争在专区级机关展开
    本报特约新华社贵阳1日电  贵州省各专区和自治州一级的机关、团体、学校，反对资产阶级右派分子的斗争已相继展开。这些机关、团体、学校中的右派分子，正被陆续揭露出来。
    安顺专区的文教界，从7月份以来连续集会，对安顺师范学校教员、右派分子吴超展开了说理斗争。他在大鸣大放期间，诬蔑共产党对知识分子的政策是“帽子扣”、“棍子打”；并说今天共产党是“任人唯愚”。他公然叫嚣要安顺师范学校共产党员校长下台。
    遵义专区机关反右派斗争展开后，已经揭露出若干个险恶的右派小集团。在人民银行中心支行和遵义市支行内揭露出来的以王其海、罗正开为首的七人右派小集团，在大鸣大放期间曾举行秘密会议四次，决定要分头到各处点火，煽动落后学生上街游行，反对共产党。反击右派斗争展开后，这七个右派分子的丑恶嘴脸都暴露出来了。
    黔南布依族苗族自治州工商联副主任委员丘廉白，在大鸣大放期间，煽动工商业者退出公私合营企业，叫嚣要撤去公私合营企业的公方代表，企图使资本主义复辟。现在，这个州的工商界已向丘廉白展开说理斗争，揭露和驳斥他反共反社会主义的言行。（附图片）
    东北工学院院长靳树梁，在大鸣大放期间坚持社会主义立场，挺身而出，有力地反击了右派分子的猖狂进攻。
    有一次，右派分子在学校里准备成立一个凌驾于行政和党之上的非法组织，要胁迫他同意。靳树梁驳斥说：“这是取消党的领导的行动，我完全不能同意。”右派分子还鼓动矿山机电系的学生反对毕业设计，靳树梁对于这种违反党的教育方针的错误行动，进行了不屈的斗争，并且教育和说服了被右派分子所利用了的学生。
