Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Through the in-depth exposure during the series of meetings held by the Chinese Writers Association in recent days, Xiao Qian's ugly features as a comprador politician have been more clearly revealed to the public.

During a period after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Xiao Qian, under the pseudonym "Tata Mulin," wrote "Long Talks with Red Hairs," and under his real name, "Life Interviews," releasing countless poisonous arrows that were anti-communist, anti-people, anti-socialist, and that glorified imperialism. For example, in his article "Humanity and Human Rights," Xiao Qian even said that China was a "geographical term" rather than a country. In his article "Political Parties, Peace, Land Reclamation," he also stated, "We also agree with the Westerners (Note: referring to American and British imperialism) that we are not 'modern enough'." Xiao Qian not only regretted that the plan for the imperialist joint administration of China during the Boxer Rebellion had not been realized but also specifically plotted in "Long Talks with Red Hairs" a "future" for China ruled by American imperialism under the form of "international co-management." At the same time, Xiao Qian viciously cursed the Chinese people as "closest to lower-class creatures" in his articles. In the appendix to "Long Talks with Red Hairs" (actually a letter Xiao Qian wrote to himself under the name of a certain reader), he wrote: "I (Note: Xiao Qian) have a strange fantasy that all people in my country (Note: China) who are over thirty-five years old should be completely executed. Because older people are either stubborn in their thinking or semi-feudal (those with clear minds can be spared and reused); this group is truly the bad guys in our country." Everyone pointed out that Xiao Qian was saying that, apart from "lackeys" like him who were "clear-minded" and could be "spared and reused," many Chinese people should be slaughtered.

The articles listed above, as well as Xiao Qian's series of anti-communist and anti-people remarks, were published by Xiao Qian from 1946 to 1948, when American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek Group still ruled over most of China. Xiao Qian became the vanguard for imperialism's anti-communist and anti-people propaganda. However, around 1948, the domestic situation took a sharp turn for the worse. The rule of imperialism in China and Chiang Kai-shek's small court were on the verge of total collapse. Xiao Qian, this comprador politician who was good at changing course with the wind, raised the banner of so-called "liberalism" and the "middle road," attempting to open up a "new path" for imperialism in China. At that time, with the support of the Kuomintang, Xiao Qian, along with Qian Changzhao and others, organized the "China Political and Economic Research Association" in Peiping and published the organ journal "New Path," peddling a hodgepodge of reformism copied from the United States and Britain. In the "Thirty-Two Articles of the China Political and Economic Research Association" and some editorials that Xiao Qian wrote for "Ta Kung Pao" during this period, he talked extensively about "freedom," "democracy," "peace," and "progress," attempting to use these to replace the Kuomintang's artillery shells used to encircle and suppress the people, to ease the sharp edge of the people's revolution, and to hinder the victorious development of the People's Liberation War. Xiao Qian wrote in his articles: "For domestic rebellions (Note: referring to the People's Liberation War led by the Chinese Communist Party), suppression is only a passive method; there must be active correction and remedy." He demanded that the Chiang Kai-shek Group "rather than reversing the tide like Empress Dowager Cixi destroying the New Policies," learn the "political wisdom" of the British, so as to avoid a "October Revolution" in China.

Everyone revealed that Xiao Qian was not only a loyal lackey of imperialism in politics but also extremely shameless in morality and character.

On the eve of the national liberation, Xiao Qian put on the guise of a writer and journalist, pretending to "confess" to the people and mixed into the revolutionary ranks. Since liberation, the Communist Party has not held Xiao Qian accountable for his past, assigning him important positions such as Deputy Editor-in-Chief of "People's China" and Deputy Editor-in-Chief of "Wenyi Bao," giving him ample opportunities for self-reform. However, apart from putting on simple people's clothes, Xiao Qian's ideological stance has not truly changed. He has consistently sought opportunities to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, still despising the Chinese people and hating the socialist system. It was revealed that a news item in the first issue of "New French Literature News" in 1955 stated that many foreign visitors to China did not understand why the liberated Chinese people were always smiling, but Xiao Qian provided an "important" answer to this. According to Xiao Qian, the eyes of the Chinese people are upturned to the sides, and to match the eyes, the corners of the Chinese people's mouths are also often upturned, which became the so-called "smile." Everyone believed that this was a new example of Xiao Qian's malicious slander of the Chinese people. Everyone also pointed out that although Xiao Qian has not been able to dine at the same table with his imperialist masters since liberation, he has been in close contact with right-wing leaders such as Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji. Everyone said that Xiao Qian's attacks on the Communist Party during the Great Blooming and Letting was by no means due to some "personal grievances," as Xiao Qian claimed. It would be better for Xiao Qian to explain himself what bad ideas he gave to the Zhang-Luo alliance and what instructions he received from the Zhang-Luo alliance. It was revealed that from the time Xiao Qian began to enter the literary world, he both wooed progressive writers to decorate his facade and mixed with the right-wing literati of the New Moon Society of the Hu Shi system. He deeply despised the revolutionary left-wing literary and art cause at that time, and once cursed Guo Moruo's novel "One Hand," which was based on the theme of the struggle between labor and capital, as "madman's ranting." Later in Shanghai, while Xiao Qian was editing the "Ta Kung Pao" literary supplement, publishing progressive works and producing a special issue on Lu Xun, he also slandered the Shanghai left-wing writers' educational work among the masses as "competing for fame and profit," and scolded the left-wing writers for helping Lu Xun's coffin to be buried as "robbing the dead." In this way, Xiao Qian stirred up trouble between the "Shanghai School" (Shanghai's left-wing literature and art) and the "Beijing School" (the right-wing literature and art of the New Moon Society), from which he quickly gained fame and profit, to the point of getting a fitting nickname, "Hai Jing Bo" (the name of a foreign circus).

The conference on criticizing Xiao Qian has recently continued for three times. Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, and Vice Chairmen Lao She and Shao Quanlin spoke at the meeting. Fang Meng, Ye Junjian, Fang Turen, Fang Jucheng, Zhang Yan, Liu Beisi, Zhang Guangnian, Bing Xin, Bian Zhilin, Kang Tuo, Zou Difan, Yang Gang, Gao Ji, Shen Congwen, Huang Yongyu and many others also spoke. The people attending the meeting pointed out that Xiao Qian's attitude of "confessing" his problems at large and small meetings is very insincere until now. Everyone was extremely dissatisfied with this. The conference will continue to be held.

### 作协连日举行大会深入揭发  萧乾是帝国主义的忠顺奴才

　　作协连日举行大会深入揭发
　　萧乾是帝国主义的忠顺奴才
    据新华社19日讯　经过中国作家协会连日来举行的大会的深入揭露，萧乾的洋奴政客的丑恶原形更清楚地暴露在人们面前了。
    萧乾在抗日战争胜利后的一个时期中，化名塔塔木林所写的“红毛长谈”以及用他本名所写的“人生采访”等书和文章，放出了无数反共、反人民、反社会主义和歌颂帝国主义的毒箭。如萧乾在“人道与人权”一文中，竟说中国是一个“地理名词”，而不是一个国家；他在“政党、和平、填土工作”一文中又说，“我们对西人（注：指美英帝国主义）骂我们不够‘现代国家条件’也有同感”。萧乾不仅后悔庚子年帝国主义共管中国的计划未能实现，而且在“红毛长谈”中还具体地策划了一个在“国际共管”形式下由美帝国主义统治中国的“前途”。与此同时，萧乾在文章中则恶毒地咒骂中国人是“最接近下级生物的”，他在“红毛长谈”的附录（实际上是萧乾冒名某读者写给自己的一封信）中写道：“敝人（注：即萧乾）有一个奇怪的幻想，在敝国（注：即中国）凡年满三十五岁以上者，应该完全处以极刑。因为上了年纪的人思想不是顽固，或者就是半封建（头脑清楚的可以免死重用），他们这一群才真正是敝国的坏蛋。”大家指出，萧乾这是说，除去像他这种“头脑清楚”的“奴才”可以“免死重用”以外，很多中国人都要被斩尽杀绝。
    上边列举的这些文章以及萧乾一系列反共、反人民的言论是萧乾在1946年到1948年发表的，当时美帝国主义和蒋介石集团还统治着大半个中国，萧乾就成了为帝国主义进行反共、反人民宣传的急先锋。但是1948年前后国内形势急转直下，帝国主义在中国的统治和蒋介石小朝廷已经面临总崩溃的前夕，萧乾这个善于见风使舵的洋奴政客，就打出了所谓“自由主义”、“中间路线”的旗帜，企图为帝国主义在中国开辟“新路”。萧乾当时在国民党支持之下，同钱昌照等在北平组织了“中国政治经济研究会”，并出版了机关刊物“新路”，贩运他从美英抄来的改良主义的大杂拌。在“中国政治经济研究会”的“三十二条纲领”以及萧乾这个时期为“大公报”所写的一些社评中，他都大谈“自由”、“民主”、“和平”、“进步”，企图以此来代替国民党围剿人民的炮弹，缓和人民革命的锋芒，阻挠人民解放战争的胜利发展。萧乾在文章中写道：“对于国内的叛变（注：指中国共产党领导的人民解放战争），弹压不过是消极办法，必须有积极的修正补救”，他要求蒋介石集团“与其像慈禧摧残新政般的逆流硬撞”，不如学英国人的“政治智慧”，以便在中国避免一次“十月革命”。
    大家揭露，萧乾不仅在政治上是帝国主义的忠顺奴才，在道德和品格上也是极其寡廉鲜耻的。
    萧乾在全国解放前夕披上了作家、记者的外衣，伪装向人民“忏悔”而混入了革命队伍。解放以来，共产党对萧乾不究既往，分配他担任“人民中国”副总编辑、“文艺报”副总编辑等要职，并给他以充分进行自我改造的机会，但是萧乾除了穿上了朴素的人民服装以外，思想立场并没有真正改变。他一贯伺机反对共产党的领导，仍然藐视中国人民和仇视社会主义制度。据揭露，1955年第一期“新法兰西文学报”的一则消息说，许多访问中国的外宾不理解解放了的中国人为什么总是笑容满面，但是萧乾却对此提供了一个“重要”答案，据萧乾认为，中国人的眼睛是朝两边向上吊起来的，为了配合眼睛，中国人的嘴角也就经常向上吊起来，这就成了所谓“微笑”。大家认为，这是萧乾恶毒诬蔑中国人民的新例证。大家还指出，解放以来萧乾虽然不能同他的帝国主义主子们同桌共餐，但是他却同章伯钧罗隆基等右派头子密切交往。大家说，萧乾在大鸣大放中对共产党的进攻，绝不是像萧乾所说的那样由于什么“个人恩怨”，萧乾究竟为章罗联盟出过什么坏主意，他从章罗联盟那里接受过什么指示，还是萧乾自己交代为好。据揭露，从萧乾开始进入文坛的时候起，他就一面拉拢进步作家装点门面，一方面同胡适系统的新月派右翼文人混在一起。他十分鄙视当时革命的左翼文艺事业，曾经谩骂郭沫若当时写以劳资斗争为主题的小说“一只手”是“疯子乱叫”。此后在上海，萧乾一方面在编辑“大公报”文艺副刊时，刊登进步作品、出鲁迅特辑，一方面又诬蔑上海左翼作家对群众的教育工作是“争名夺利”，骂左翼作家扶鲁迅的灵柩下葬是“抢死人”。萧乾就是这样在当时的“海派”（上海的左翼文艺）和“京派”（新月派的右翼文艺）之间混水摸鱼，从中使自己迅速地扬名获利，以至得到一个恰如其分的绰号“海京伯”（是一个外国马戏团的名称）。
    关于批判萧乾的大会最近继续举行了三次，中国作家协会主席茅盾，副主席老舍、邵荃麟都在会上发了言。发言的还有方蒙、叶君健、方土人、方巨成、张彦、刘北汜、张光年、冰心、卞之琳、康濯、邹荻帆、杨刚、高集、沈从文、黄永玉等多人。与会的人们指出，直到现在为止，萧乾在大会小会上“交代”问题的态度很不老实。对此，大家极为不满。大会还将继续举行。
