    Zeng Zhaolun's Reactionary Essence
    Zhou Jianren
    I am not here to investigate Zeng Zhaolun's past history. It is only because he has committed sinful words and deeds of anti-communism, anti-people, and anti-socialism that one must understand whether these words and deeds are accidental or due to temporary ideological confusion. Therefore, one cannot help but look at his past history.
    Zeng Zhaolun's past history does not need to be traced too far back. It is enough to briefly examine the period from when Japan was about to surrender to when Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang reactionaries, supported by American imperialism, actively attacked the liberated areas. At a time when the struggle between the old and new forces was so sharp, it was impossible for people not to make a decision about which side to stand on. It is said that Zeng Zhaolun met with Chen Cheng several times around 1945. In the autumn of the same year, after Japan surrendered, Yu Dawei, the Kuomintang Minister of National Defense, ordered Zeng Zhaolun to go to the United States to study atomic energy science. Zeng Zhaolun's political stance was very clear.
    Before going abroad in 1946, Zeng also personally visited Chen Cheng and frequently attended banquets hosted by Tang Siliang, the head of the Kuomintang secret service. When he went abroad, Tang also sent someone to give Zeng Zhaolun money. According to Zeng himself, the amount of money was not large (?), but even if the amount was not large, there was a relationship between them, which was self-evident. And this relationship obviously cannot but be said to be a political relationship, right? Even if Zeng Zhaolun tried to downplay the problem, he could not completely deny that he had talked about politics, only saying that he "rarely talked about politics"! But how little is "rarely"? And what exactly was talked about? This question cannot but naturally arise in many people's minds. But even if Zeng Zhaolun himself did not say it, there are facts to prove his position. During his time in the United States, it is said that Zeng wrote two reports to the Kuomintang's pseudo-Ordnance Department and asked for the reports to be forwarded to Chen Cheng. He also planned to establish an atomic energy research institution under the leadership of the Kuomintang to engage in military industry after returning to China. At this time, the CCP was leading the people of the whole country in a life-and-death struggle against Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism. Isn't Zeng Zhaolun's series of political stances and political intentions clearly serving Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism?
    In the year Zeng Zhaolun returned from the United States (1948), the People's Liberation Army had liberated the Northeast, and military victories were being won one after another. The people of the whole country were rejoicing, but Zeng Zhaolun felt the opposite. He felt "depressed and hesitant" and felt negative, even "wanting to live in seclusion in Hong Kong." This is a section of his own statement of his anti-communist and anti-people stance. But this is only one aspect. There is also a positive reactionary aspect, that is, after he went to Hong Kong, he participated in Zhang Bojun's rightist activities. In his confession, he said that at this time "his thinking turned even more to the right." The meaning is only that it turned a little more to the right, but in fact, it was nothing more than adhering to his consistent anti-communist and anti-people stance!
    After Zeng arrived in Beijing in 1949, he and Zhang Dongsun and Luo Longji started an anti-communist group to carry out political conspiracies. In 1950, Zhang, Luo, and Zeng discussed that, in order to "have someone in the court to make things easier," he was recommended to the Ministry of Education as Deputy Minister. And then he carried out a series of conspiratorial activities; one method was to try to place private individuals in colleges and universities, and another method was to exclude progressive elements within the Democratic League, attempting to seize important positions.
    As mentioned above, Zeng Zhaolun's anti-communism, anti-people, and anti-socialism has been consistent. During the period of the Great Blooming and Letting, Zeng Zhaolun's anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist essence increased rather than decreased. It is enough to see a glimpse of it from his speech at the Six Professors' Symposium in early June this year. He gloated over the estimate that the current situation was on the verge of breaking out, saying that the Communist Party should not think that scholars cannot rebel! He said: "Today there are many problems with students, and they are on the verge of breaking out. Once they take to the streets, the citizens will unite, and the problem will become bigger. Because today the masses are also dissatisfied with the Party, don't think that scholars can't rebel for three years," and so on.
    This passage is completely without factual basis and is entirely based on the subjective speculation of reactionary thought. Zeng Zhaolun fortunately believes that the reason why scholars can rebel is that the masses are also dissatisfied with the Party. But this estimate is completely wrong. In fact, the masses are satisfied with the Party, not dissatisfied. Because Zeng Zhaolun is standing on the reactionary side, he cannot see the real masses. He is standing within the Zhang-Luo alliance, regarding the reactionary group as the "masses," and thus subjectively mistakenly believes that the masses are also dissatisfied with the Party. Weren't the students of Hanyang Middle School instigated by several counter-revolutionary elements to cause trouble; weren't they finally opposed and stopped by the workers and peasants? In the anti-rightist struggle in various organs and units, haven't the rightists also been retreating steadily? If the masses are dissatisfied with the Party, how can the situation be like this, and not like Zeng Zhaolun's subjective thinking?
    Zeng Zhaolun went on to say that "Chinese intellectuals have a tradition of causing trouble, from the students of the Han Dynasty to the 'May Fourth' Movement, they were all started by students..." which is also full of reactionary ideological concepts (i.e., ideological systems). The era of the Han Dynasty is too far away from now, so there is no need to discuss it. As for the situation of the May Fourth era, people who are a little older have seen it. Who held the power at that time? What was the political situation like? Which class does today's regime belong to? What is the political situation like? How can it be compared with the student movement situation in the May Fourth era? However, Zeng Zhaolun actually made such a view! Isn't it because his anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist stance led to this view?
    In addition, he also said that intellectuals should not be treated in a movement style, which he is afraid of. This also clearly shows that he is standing on the opposite side rather than on the side of the people, otherwise, what is there to be afraid of? Zeng Zhaolun also said that intellectuals should be given more opportunities to speak and respect them, but the Party does not. In fact, intellectuals have many opportunities to speak, and when has there ever been a restriction? As for respecting intellectuals, the Party has always respected intellectuals. Since the initial period of the revolutionary victory when schools were taken over, the words spoken by the Party representatives to teachers and students have expressed respect for intellectuals. Later, Premier Zhou's words about intellectuals and a series of practical arrangements, such as measures for respecting intellectuals, are even more known to everyone. And Zeng Zhaolun actually said that the Party does not give intellectuals opportunities to speak and does not give them respect. This completely untrue statement is caused by his subjective dissatisfaction with people's democratic politics and dissatisfaction with socialism.
    Expressing dissatisfaction with the new society and wanting to return to the old society is generally called restoration. Emperors, princes, etc., want to restore because they want to regain the power to be kings and dominate; however, today some rightist elements, in fact, their position is higher than in the old society, and their enjoyment is not reduced, but increased. There are also complete powers, unless they are incompetent for that kind of work. If they are competent, but they are not allowed to do it and others are appointed to do it instead, that is unimaginable. It is just that the new society has a new set of organizational discipline and a new personnel system, and factionalism and embezzlement are not allowed. Although their position in the new society is higher than before, and their lives are better than before, they cannot do whatever they want, and they will still feel dissatisfied. This is one reason. This reason also explains that there are more hidden reasons, that is: people from which class, their minds are filled with a set of political concepts (i.e., ideological forms, also translated as thought systems) suitable for that class. Therefore, there are thousands of links with the original class, and there is also this relationship with the political system, with deep feelings. Even if their position in the new society is higher than before, and their lives are better than before, because they are not used to the way of life and system of the new society, and they see the old class is gradually collapsing, of course, they will also produce unhappiness and heartache, and they will fantasize about restoration. It is said that Zeng Zhaolun only taught in universities and worked in chemical societies in old China. During his study abroad in the United States, he only wanted to set up a research institute under the pseudo-Ministry of National Defense. What about after liberation? Wasn't he the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher Education, the Director of the Institute of Chemistry, and a member of the academic department? But he still feels that the Party does not give intellectuals respect, and he still wants to restore capitalism, which explains the above problem.
    Of course, the exposed rightist elements all have great ambitions. Zhang Bojun has great ambitions, Luo Longji has great ambitions, and so does Zeng Zhaolun. People who are familiar with him say that he is a typical power-grabbing expert, who has always had a bossy style. This is also a part of the old ideological system.
    Zeng Zhaolun does not hide his ambition; however, he explained it this way. In his self-criticism and confession, he said: He believes that he has contributed to the anti-Chiang and the overthrow of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang... which cultivated his excessively arrogant and conceited thoughts. But this is completely inconsistent with what has been exposed. No trace of anti-Chiang and anti-Kuomintang reactionary rule can be found in the exposed words, only the fact that he has repeatedly associated with Chen Cheng and accepted money from the secret service chief Tang Siliang! At the end of his self-criticism and confession, Zeng Zhaolun always said a few words similar to "Under the education of the Party, I will thoroughly transform myself and start a new life." As long as these words are said wholeheartedly, not "hypocritically" (Zeng's own words), of course, it is good and will be welcomed by the people. But comparing the exposed words with the boasted words, it is obviously very inconsistent and seems dishonest. I wonder what Zeng Zhaolun himself is preparing to do?

    曾昭抡的反动本质
    周建人
    我不是要在这里追究曾昭抡过去的历史。只因为他有着反共反人民反社会主义的罪恶言行，要使人明白这言行是不是偶然的，是不是由于一时的思想的糊涂，就不能不看一看他的已往的历史。
    曾昭抡过去的历史不需要追踪得很遥远，只要略查一下从日本将投降及蒋介石国民党反动派在美帝国主义支持下积极向解放区进攻时期这一段情况也就可以了。在新旧二种力量斗争如此尖锐的时候，人们不可能不作出究竟站在哪一边的决定。据说曾昭抡在1945年间就曾和陈诚见过好几次面。同年秋季日本投降后，国民党国防部长俞大维即命曾昭抡往美国去学习原子能方面的科学。曾昭抡的政治立场是很分明的。
    1946年出国前，曾又亲自去拜见陈诚，并且经常参加国民党特务头子唐嗣亮的宴会。出国时，唐又差专人送给曾昭抡钱。据曾自己说其钱数目并不多（？），即使数目不多，但其间存有一种关系，毕竟是不言而喻的。而且这种关系显然不能不说是政治关系吧？曾昭抡即使力求避重就轻地交代问题，也不能完全否认曾谈到政治，只能说“很少谈到政治”！可是所谓很少究竟少到多少？又谈的究竟是些什么？这一疑问，在许多人的脑中不可能不很自然地产生。可是曾昭抡自己即使不说，却有事实证明他的立场。曾在美国时期，听说曾二次写报告给国民党的伪兵工署，并且要求将报告转给陈诚看。又准备在国民党领导下设立研究原子能的机构，回国来搞兵工。这时候正是中共领导全国人民向蒋介石和美帝国主义进行生死斗争的时候，曾昭抡这一系列政治立场和政治意图不是很明显地为蒋介石和美帝国主义服务吗？
    曾昭抡从美国回来的一年（1948年），解放军已解放了东北，军事节节胜利，全国人民欢欣鼓舞，而曾昭抡却正相反，他偏偏感到“苦闷、徬徨”，感到消极，竟“想在香港隐居起来”。这是他自己表明的反共反人民的立场的一节。可是这还只是一方面，还有积极反动的一方面，那就是他到香港后就参加了章伯钧的右派活动。他交代里说这时候“他的思想就更向右转”了。意思只是更向右了一些而已，实际上无非坚持他的一贯反共反人民的立场！
    曾到北京以后，1949年，就和张东荪及罗隆基搞起反共集团，进行政治阴谋活动。1950年张、罗、曾三人商量，为了“朝里有人好做事”，他被推荐到教育部任副部长。并且接着做了一联串的阴谋活动；一种方法是企图把私人安插到高等院校里去，另一方法是排挤民主同盟内部的进步分子，企图把要职把持起来。
    如上所讲，曾昭抡反共反人民反社会主义是一贯的。在大鸣大放期间，曾昭抡的反共反人民反社会主义的本质有增无减。只要从今年6月初他在六教授座谈会上的发言，就可以看出一斑。他幸灾乐祸地估计目前形势一触即发，说共产党不要以为秀才造不成反！他说：“今天学生的问题很多，一触即发，他们一上街，市民就结合起来，问题就闹大了。因为今天群众对党也是不满的，不要看秀才造反三年不成”云云。
    这一段话毫无实际根据，完全出于反动思想的主观的推测。曾昭抡很庆幸地认为秀才能够造成反的根据说是群众也是对党不满。岂知这种估计完全错误。事实上群众对党是满意的，并非不满。曾昭抡因为站在反动一方面，就看不见真正的群众。他是站在章罗联盟之内，把反动集团看成了“群众”，遂主观地误为群众对党也不满了。汉阳中学学生是曾经受几个反革命分子的煽动而闹事；不是终于被工农群众所反对而制止了吗？各机关单位的反右派斗争中，不也是右派节节败退了吗？如果群众对党不满，怎么情况会是这样，而不像曾昭抡的主观思想那样呢？
    曾昭抡接着说“中国知识分子闹事是有传统的，从汉朝的太学生到‘五四’都是学生闹起来的……”也同样充满着反动的观念形态（即观念体系）。汉朝的时代离今已太遥远，不必去论它，至于五四时代的情形是年纪稍稍大一点的人都看到过的。那时候政权掌握在哪些人手里？那种政治情况又怎么样？今日的政权属于哪一阶级？政治情况又怎么样？怎么可以与五四时代学生运动情况相比拟？然而曾昭抡竟作这样看法！岂不是因他的反共反人民反社会主义的立场遂有此看法吗？
    此外他又说不应该以运动方式对待知识分子，他就害怕。这话也明明表示他站在对立方面而不是站在人民方面，要不然，又何怕之有？曾昭抡还说应该多给知识分子讲话的机会和尊重他们，但党不给。实际上知识分子讲话的机会很多，何时曾有过限制？至于尊重知识分子，党一向就是尊重知识分子的。自从革命胜利初期接收学校时候起，党代表向师生讲的话，就表示尊重知识分子的。以后，周总理所讲的关于知识分子的话和实际上的安排等一系列的措施，对于知识分子的尊重更是大家所知道的。而曾昭抡竟说党不给知识分子讲话机会和不给尊重，这种完全不合事实的话，就是他的主观上不满意人民民主政治，不满意社会主义所致。
    对于新社会表示不满，想回复到旧社会去，一般叫做复辟。皇帝，亲王等想复辟是因为想复得已失的称王称霸的权势；然而今日有些右派分子，实际上他的地位比在旧社会里是高了，享受也不是降低了，而是提高了。职权也完全是有的，除非自己不能胜任那种工作。如果能胜任，却不让他去做而另委他人去代做，那是不可想像的事情。只是新社会有一套新的组织纪律，新的人事制度，闹宗派和营私舞弊等等却都不允许，虽然在新社会里地位比以前高了，生活也比以前好了，但不能为所欲为，还会感觉到不满意的。这是一个理由。这一理由也就说明还有比较更暗藏的理由，即：从哪一种阶级来的人，脑子里就藏有一套适合那种阶级的那种政治的观念体系（即观念形态，亦译称思想体系）。因此与原来的阶级有千丝万缕的联系，与政治制度也有这种关系，有着深切的感情。即使在新社会里地位比以前高了，生活比以前好了，由于与新社会的生活方式和制度不习惯，又眼看得旧有的阶级日趋溃灭，当然也要产生不快与痛心，是会幻想着复辟的。听说曾昭抡在旧中国仅在大学里教过书和在化学会里担任些工作。在留学美国时代，也不过想望在伪国防部下面搞一个研究所。解放以后怎么样？不是做了教育部、高等教育部的副部长，化学研究所的主任，并且是学部委员了吗？但他还觉得党不给知识分子以尊重，还想复资本主义的辟，这就说明了上述的问题。
    当然，被揭发出来的右派分子都有极大的野心，章伯钧有极大的野心，罗隆基有极大的野心，曾昭抡也是这样。熟悉他的人说他本是典型的弄权专家，一向有把头作风。这也是旧观念体系里含有的一部分。
    曾昭抡并不隐瞒有野心；不过他是这样解释的，他在检讨与交代里说：自认为反蒋有功，推翻国民党的反动统治我也有分……养成了我过分自高自大的思想。可是这话与被揭发出来的话完全不符，揭发的话里找不出反蒋反国民党反动统治的痕迹，只有与陈诚屡次往来，及接受特务头子唐嗣亮的钱的事实！曾昭抡检讨与交代结束时，总说几句类似“要在党的教育下，脱胎换骨地改造自己，重新做人”的话。只要这话是一心一意地说出来的，不是“口是心非”（曾自己的话）地说出来的，当然是好的，将为人民所欢迎。但揭发的话与自夸的话对照起来，显然很不符合，显得并不老实。不知曾昭抡自己究竟预备怎么样？
