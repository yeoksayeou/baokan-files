Comrades Representatives:
    The main task of our congress is to summarize the women's work of the past four years and determine the tasks for the future. Now, on behalf of the Second Executive Committee of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, I present a report on this issue for the consideration of the congress.
    (I) The Great Changes in the Motherland and the Tremendous Changes in the Status of Women
    More than four years have passed since the Second National Women's Congress of China in April 1953. This has been an extremely great historical period. During this period, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and in accordance with the general line of the state during the transition period, the people of our country, through peaceful means, basically completed the socialist transformation of the national economy, established socialist relations of production, and liberated the social productive forces. At the same time, China's socialist construction has developed rapidly, the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy is about to be completed and overfulfilled, and great achievements have been made in industry, agriculture, transportation, commerce, handicrafts, culture, education, medicine and health, science, and art, laying a preliminary foundation for the country's socialist industrialization.
    In such a tremendous revolution and construction, women of all nationalities and strata in our country have demonstrated a high degree of patriotism and made unprecedented and enormous contributions with their diligent hands, becoming an indispensable force in the cause of socialism, once again proving what Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out: women are a force that determines the victory or defeat of the revolution. After the basic completion of the socialist revolution, Chinese women have enjoyed equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, social, and family life, forever ending the tragic history of thousands of years of oppression and enslavement, and achieving women's liberation.
    Over the past four years, especially after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the national economy, the status of women of all nationalities and strata in our country has undergone tremendous changes. Peasant women are the largest majority of women. Due to the realization of agricultural cooperation, the economic life of the vast number of rural women has undergone a more profound change than the land reform. In 1956, about 120 million rural women, together with male peasants, participated in agricultural production cooperatives, engaged in agriculture, animal husbandry, and sideline production. The women's enthusiasm for labor was unprecedentedly high, and the scope of labor was greatly expanded. The labor work points they obtained generally reached about 25% of the total labor work points of the entire cooperative. With the development of agricultural production cooperatives and the gradual improvement of the management system, the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women is being gradually realized. They have also made immeasurable contributions in housework and family sideline production. Due to these efforts of rural women, they have played a significant role in increasing agricultural and sideline production, increasing the income of peasant families, and supporting the industrial construction of the motherland; at the same time, they have demonstrated women's talents and wisdom. Therefore, the economic status of women in society and in the family has been greatly improved. Women can generally manage the household together with men in the family and participate in family economic management. Women have participated in leadership positions in agricultural production cooperatives. Currently, among the 756,000 agricultural production cooperatives nationwide, 70-80% of the cooperatives have female chairpersons or vice-chairpersons, totaling more than 500,000 people. There are even more women serving as members of the cooperative affairs committee and production team leaders.
    The vast number of handicraft women actively participated in the handicraft cooperation movement. By the end of 1956, more than 1.5 million female handicraft workers were organized in handicraft production cooperative organizations, accounting for about 30% of the total number of male and female cooperative (group) members. They were generally able to overcome difficulties, work hard, learn technology, and strive to increase production, demonstrating their role in production; thus, their economic status in the family and in society has also been greatly improved.
    Due to the rapid development of socialist construction, the ranks of female employees have expanded. In 1952, there were about 1.5 million female employees nationwide; by the end of 1956, this had reached more than 3 million, doubling the number from 1952. In socialist industrial production and various construction undertakings, women are working hard everywhere. Together with male employees, they have achieved remarkable accomplishments, demonstrating the collective heroism of the working class and the ability to create history. By the end of 1956 alone, more than 110,000 female employees in various industrial and mining enterprises across the country had been评选 as advanced producers or advanced workers. With the development of production, the wages of employees are gradually increasing, the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women has been realized, and the wages of female employees have been increased as well as male employees; they are protected by labor insurance and welfare for birth, old age, sickness, and death; and the unique difficulties of female workers have received the necessary consideration.
    The vast number of employee family members, as part of the working class, have made glorious contributions to the development of industrial production and construction in our country. They are diligent and thrifty in managing the household, implementing the "Five Goods" (good at diligence and thrift in managing the household, good at unity and mutual assistance, good at educating children, good at cleanliness and hygiene, and good at studying hard), and striving to support the production labor of employees. Therefore, their contributions are included in the labor achievements of the employees. They have demonstrated the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual benefit, organized labor and economic mutual assistance, and overcome their own difficulties. They actively participate in social activities and serve the public, and are respected by society.
    Among bourgeois women, the majority are able and are accepting socialist transformation, and they are striving to transform their ideology through learning and participating in social practice. When public-private joint ownership was implemented in all industries, female industrialists and businesswomen were given arrangements and became employees of enterprises or state organs. The social and family status of industrialists and businesswomen's family members has also been improved.
    Women of all nationalities in our country have actively participated in the management of state affairs. The vast majority of women across the country participated in the Five Great Movements and the Three Great Transformations, participated in the nationwide discussion of the formulation of the Constitution, and participated in the election movements for the two sessions of grassroots people's congresses in 1953 and 1956. More and more female activists have been selected by the people to leading positions in state organs at all levels, which more clearly marks that Chinese women have changed from slaves of society to masters of society. Women representatives accounted for a certain proportion in the grassroots people's congresses. In 1953, when the first grassroots election was held nationwide, women elected as grassroots people's representatives accounted for 17% of the total number of representatives; in 1956, when the second grassroots election was held nationwide, the proportion of female representatives elected increased to 20.3%, totaling more than 1 million people. There are 148 female representatives in the National People's Congress, accounting for 12% of the total number of representatives; among them, there are 19 female representatives of ethnic minorities, accounting for 11% of the total number of ethnic minority representatives. Female representatives of all nationalities, together with male representatives, inspect work, discuss and decide on major national and local policies, and can make suggestions and criticisms on government work at any time. In the national administrative organs, the number of women selected to participate in leadership work is also constantly increasing. At present, there are many women serving as ministers and vice ministers, directors and deputy directors in the State Council; serving as vice governors and directors and deputy directors in the provincial people's committees; and there are female county magistrates, female mayors, female state governors, female banner chiefs, and female district heads in many places across the country; and in the grassroots government, the number of women participating in leadership work is even greater, with about half of the townships across the country having women serving as township heads or deputy township heads, and women cadres accounting for about 80% of the total number of cadres in the neighborhood committees of various cities across the country. There are also more than 1,000 female cadres in the courts at all levels across the country serving as presidents, presiding judges, and judges.
    With the development of China's cultural and educational undertakings, the number of female intellectuals is increasing day by day. In 1950, there were only 2,319 female professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants in universities across the country, but by 1956, this had increased to 11,207. The number of female teachers in secondary schools has reached 37,761 (excluding female teachers in secondary normal schools), and the number of female teachers in primary schools has reached 347,785. Women have reached more than 850,000 in the ranks of medical and health technicians at all levels across the country. The number of women in cultural and artistic personnel and scientific and technological personnel is increasing year by year. Among the female intellectuals who came from the old society, the vast majority have been tempered in various social movements and ideological transformations, have raised their political awareness, and are willing to serve the thriving socialist motherland.
    There are a large number of female students in schools at all levels. In the 1956-1957 academic year, there were 100,374 female students in universities (including graduate students), accounting for 24.6% of the total number of students, and the proportion of female students in advanced medical and health schools was as high as 42%. There are more than 1,729,400 female students in secondary schools, accounting for 29% of the total number of students. There are more than 22,314,900 female students in primary schools, accounting for 35% of the total number of students. Such a large number of women obtaining the opportunity to receive education is something that has never happened in Chinese history. The vast number of working women are working hard to improve their culture. In 1956, 8.9 million people across the country got rid of illiteracy, about half of whom were women. Women in various work positions learn while working, gradually increasing their cultural, scientific knowledge, and business capabilities.
    A new atmosphere of protecting marriage, family, mothers, and children in society has been further established. Since the movement to publicize and implement the Marriage Law in 1953, new marriage and family relationships have been developing and consolidating day by day. Protecting women's labor force and protecting children's safety and health have attracted widespread attention in society. Children's childcare services have been greatly developed. By the end of 1956, there were about 26,700 childcare institutions of various types in cities across the country, taking care of more than 1.25 million children, an increase of 260 times compared with 1949. In 1956, busy farming childcare organizations developed rapidly, taking care of more than 6 million children. This has played a significant role in giving play to the socialist enthusiasm of mothers and promoting the physical and mental health of children.
    All these living facts prove that Chinese women have turned over from the enslavement and oppression of the exploiting classes and, together with the people of the whole country, have become the masters of the country. Such tremendous changes are the result of the Chinese Communist Party leading the people of our country to achieve the victory of the people's democratic revolution and the socialist revolution; it is also the victory of the correct women's movement policy of the Chinese Communist Party. It is only under the leadership of the Party that the organizations of the Women's Federation at all levels have implemented the Party's policy of mobilizing women and men to participate in various revolutionary movements and various construction undertakings, which has enabled their work to achieve great results. Only by following the socialist road under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can women across the country unite and become a force capable of mastering their own destiny, and can the intelligence and talents of women, which have been suppressed and submerged for a long time, be fully brought into play; and can their status in society and in the family undergo such tremendous changes. Historical experience has fully proved that only the Communist Party is the leading core of the people of the whole country and the liberator of women across the country. Only by following the socialist road with the Communist Party is the only road to women's liberation.
    (II) The Tasks of Chinese Women at the Present Stage
    After China achieved the basic victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front in 1956, the general task of the people of our country and the women of our country at the present stage is to continue to build and consolidate China's socialist system, to continue to achieve the complete victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts; to concentrate all forces to develop China's social productive forces, and to build China into a great socialist country as quickly as possible.
    The basic completion of the socialist transformation has realized the great change in the social economic system, which is a victory with epoch-making significance. However, as Chairman Mao Zedong told us: China's socialist system has not been established for long, it has not been completely built, and it has not been completely consolidated. It still needs a process of continued construction and consolidation. Although China's socialist revolution has basically won on the economic front, the fierce struggle between the people of the whole country and the bourgeois rightists on the political and ideological fronts is still going on. The question of who will win between socialism and capitalism on these two fronts has not been completely resolved. This struggle will still take a considerable amount of time to resolve. If we do not achieve complete victory in this struggle, then the victory of the socialist revolution that we have already achieved in the political system and economic system is not consolidated. Therefore, the great achievement of women's fundamental liberation is also not consolidated. For this reason, the task of the people of our country and the women of our country at the present stage is to strive for the complete and thorough victory of this struggle.
    This year, the people of our country will complete and overfulfill the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy. This is a great victory achieved in socialist construction, but it has only laid a preliminary foundation for China's socialist construction, and the socialist society has not yet been built. The resolution of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China on the political report in September 1956 pointed out that a major contradiction in our country is the people's demand for the establishment of an advanced industrial country and the reality of a backward agricultural country. Therefore, "the current main task of the Party and the people of the whole country is to concentrate their efforts to solve this contradiction and turn our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country as soon as possible." The political report of the Central Committee of the Party to the Eighth National Congress of the Party pointed out that to complete the great task of socialist industrialization, "it will take about three five-year plans. The practice of the first five-year plan proves that in order to complete the country's industrialization, the time of three five-year plans is necessary, or it will take a little more time." On the basis of China's current foundation, only after ten to fifteen years of arduous efforts can the social productive forces be developed more fully, and can the socialist economic system and political system obtain a more sufficient material foundation, and then our country will be truly consolidated, and the socialist society will be fundamentally built.
    The above are the main tasks that our people across the country must concentrate on completing. We, the more than 300 million liberated women who account for half of the population, have extremely important responsibilities for building the great socialist motherland. Building a socialist industrialized country is the highest interest of the people of the whole country and the women of the whole country. Only with the victorious development of socialist construction and the final completion of the socialist society can the people of the whole country gradually get rid of the current state of poverty and backwardness, can they gradually obtain improvements in material and cultural life, and can women and children have a more beautiful and happier future.
    China's socialist construction is an extremely huge and very arduous project. Although our construction has achieved great achievements, the economic and cultural backwardness left over from old China has not been fundamentally changed, and the level of industrial and agricultural production is still very low. Some areas are hit by natural disasters every year; the lives of the people of our country have been improved year by year, but the large population and the state of poverty left over from old China will take a long time to fundamentally change. Our technical, scientific, and cultural forces are still weak, and our construction funds are still small; therefore, we must build socialism and implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift as instructed by Chairman Mao Zedong. We must run factories with diligence and thrift, run cooperatives with diligence and thrift, run all undertakings with diligence and thrift; we must also manage households with diligence and thrift. And our women bear a particularly important responsibility for managing households with diligence and thrift. Therefore, diligence and thrift in building the country and diligence and thrift in managing households, and striving for socialist construction, is the fundamental policy of the women's movement in our country in the future.
    (III) We Must Unswervingly Follow the Socialist Road
    Representatives! At this moment when we are holding the Third National Women's Congress, the struggle of reasoning against the bourgeois rightists is continuing to expand and deepen in our cities; in urban and rural areas, a large-scale socialist education is being carried out. In rural areas, we must also counter the anti-socialist speeches and actions of unlawful landlords, rich peasant elements, counter-revolutionaries, and other bad elements. This is a great socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts following the victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front (on the ownership of means of production) last year. Only by achieving a complete victory on these two fronts can our socialist economic system and political system be more consolidated, and can our socialist construction develop victoriously on a reliable basis.
    The bourgeois rightists are completely opposed to the people of the whole country. The bourgeois rightists and other anti-communist and anti-socialist elements attempt to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system, which the people of our country and the women of our country can never allow. It is very clear that only by following the socialist road under the leadership of the Communist Party can there be liberation for the people of our country and the women of our country. If we deviate from the socialist road, our country will inevitably return to the dark road of semi-colonialism and semi-feudalism, and the people of our country and the women of our country will change from masters of the country back to slaves and beasts of burden. Therefore, our struggle with the bourgeois rightists is fundamentally irreconcilable. For the sake of the interests of our socialist country, for the sake of the interests of our people, and for the sake of the interests of women's liberation, we must resolutely struggle with the bourgeois rightists and never give up until we win complete victory.
    This struggle with the bourgeois rightists is a serious test for each of us. The vast majority of our female workers, peasant women, and other working women are enthusiastically supporting the Communist Party and the socialist system, and are resolutely following the socialist road. Therefore, when the bourgeois rightists frantically attacked the Communist Party and socialism, they rose up to fight back; in the nationwide debate on the two roads of socialism and capitalism, they can clearly recognize that it is very good to take the socialist road, and it is a dead end to take the capitalist road. But even among working women, there are some people, mainly some women from wealthy middle peasant families in rural areas, who still have great resistance to the socialist system, and they yearn for the road of capitalist wealth. There are also some people who still have individualistic ideas from the old society. When personal interests conflict with national interests and collective interests, they often put their personal interests first. As for women in the bourgeoisie and the bourgeois intellectual circles, in addition to a group of rightists who have been and are being exposed, the vast majority are willing and able to accept socialist transformation; but for the majority of them, there is a problem of abandoning the bourgeois stand and worldview and transforming to the stand and worldview of the working class. This problem has not been resolved or has not been completely resolved. Therefore, many of them, when the bourgeois rightists launched a frantic attack, could not distinguish between right and wrong for a while, and even echoed the words and actions of the rightists. This shows that every one of us women must pass the socialist test politically and ideologically, and must eliminate old ideas and raise socialist awareness in the current debate on the two roads of socialism and capitalism. Only in this way can we advance victoriously on the socialist road. In the long revolutionary struggle in the past, we women and men together passed the test of the people's revolutionary war, and then passed the test of land reform, and last year we basically passed the test of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production. The vast majority of our women have passed these tests well, and in this process, we have tempered our revolutionary will and raised our political awareness. The current problem is that we must also pass the test of socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, that is, we must transform old ideas to adapt to the new system.
    The six criteria pointed out by Chairman Mao Zedong in his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" are the guidelines for us to pass the socialist test ideologically and politically, the criteria for our ideological transformation, and the criteria for our words and actions. The six criteria pointed out by Chairman Mao Zedong for judging the right and wrong of our words and actions at the present stage are: "(1) It is conducive to uniting the people of all nationalities in the country, not dividing the people; (2) It is conducive to socialist transformation and socialist construction, not detrimental to socialist transformation and socialist construction; (3) It is conducive to consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, not undermining or weakening this dictatorship; (4) It is conducive to consolidating democratic centralism, not undermining or weakening this system; (5) It is conducive to consolidating the leadership of the Communist Party, not breaking away from or weakening this leadership; (6) It is conducive to consolidating the international unity of socialism and the international unity of peace-loving people around the world, not detrimental to these unity. Among these six standards, the most important are the socialist road and the Party's leadership." Chairman Mao Zedong also instructed us that the method we use to handle internal problems of the people, including the self-ideological transformation of the people, is the democratic method, that is, the method of persuasion and education, and the method of "unity-criticism-unity". We should transform our own thinking according to the six criteria pointed out by Chairman Mao Zedong, and adhere to the method of "unity-criticism-unity", and also help others to transform, so that our women and the people of the whole country can pass the socialist test ideologically and politically, and we can all unite more closely on the basis of socialism.
    In order to pass the socialist test well, for women from exploiting classes, the primary key is to change class stand. They must consciously abandon the old stand of the exploiting classes and stand on the stand of the working class and socialism. A small number of them have basically completed or are completing this transformation, and others should consciously realize this transformation of stand. In order to clear the old ideas of the exploiting classes from the political and ideological fronts, to thoroughly break capitalism and consolidate socialism, they must also work hard in practical work and labor, and transform their old world outlook in combination with the working class and peasants and learning from the working class and peasants. Only in this way can they adapt to the new socialist system, so as to actively contribute their strength to the socialist construction of the motherland.
    For the vast number of working women, to pass the socialist test well, first of all, it is necessary to distinguish between the major issues of right and wrong on the two roads, thoroughly criticize capitalist ideas, and correct the political direction. Only by taking the socialist road can we have an infinitely bright future. Secondly, it is necessary to overcome individualistic ideas and correctly handle the mutual relationship between personal interests and collective interests and national interests. In socialist society, the personal interests of each social member are fundamentally consistent with collective interests and national interests, and the policies of the Party and the government always take into account the interests of the country, the collective, and the personal interests of each social member. However, at certain times, especially when certain social members unilaterally pursue personal interests away from national interests and collective interests, or when collectives and the country encounter certain difficulties, and certain social members do not understand these difficulties, there are contradictions between personal interests and collective interests and national interests. At this time, we must put national interests and collective interests first, and make personal interests subordinate to the interests of the country and the collective. Only in this way can we completely, happily, actively, and unswervingly follow the Communist Party on the socialist road.
    Representatives! We women account for half of the population, and our thoughts and understanding not only dominate our own actions, but also affect our children and husbands. We must not only actively fight against the bourgeois rightists, but also carry out self-transformation, so that we can pass the socialist test ideologically and politically, so as to influence and help our loved ones to pass the socialist test well. The class struggle between us and the bourgeoisie on the political and ideological fronts, and the self-transformation of our people, are long-term and arduous processes. But as long as we all resolutely and actively work hard, this process can be shortened. We must firmly establish socialist ideas and unswervingly follow the Communist Party on the socialist road. We must win the complete and thorough victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts.
    (IV) Build the Country Through Diligence and Thrift, Manage Households Through Thrift and Diligence
    Building the country through diligence and thrift is the fundamental policy of the Party and the government leading the people of the whole country in carrying out socialist construction. Whether this policy can be implemented is the key issue related to China's socialist construction; therefore, our women must work together with the people of the whole country to consciously and actively strive to implement this policy. Chairman Mao Zedong said: "Diligent and thrifty management... should be the policy of all economic undertakings. Run factories with diligence and thrift, run stores with diligence and thrift, run all state-owned and cooperative undertakings with diligence and thrift, run all other undertakings with diligence and thrift, and everything should implement the principle of diligence and thrift. ...China is a big country, but it is still very poor. It will take decades to make China rich. Even after decades, it will still be necessary to implement the principle of diligence and thrift, but it is especially necessary to advocate diligence and thrift, and especially to pay attention to saving, in the current decades, in the current five-year plan period." This is the extremely important instruction made by Chairman Mao Zedong on the fundamental policy issue of our country's construction of socialism. We must implement the policy of diligence and thrift in whatever undertaking we do. Diligence means working hard, and thrift means practicing strict economy; diligence can increase production and increase income; thrift can reduce consumption and increase accumulation; the combination of the two can not only build the country well, but also manage the household well. Therefore, diligence and thrift are of extremely great significance to the construction of socialism. As far as women's understanding of labor is concerned, in recent years, especially after the basic completion of socialist transformation, women's view of labor as glorious has been significantly improved, and their enthusiasm for labor has been unprecedentedly high. They have created significant achievements in various production and work positions and in the family, and have emerged with many labor models, socialist construction activists, and "five-good" activists. However, the erroneous views of the landlords and the bourgeoisie who despise labor still have an impact on the masses. In addition, in our past propaganda and education work for the masses of women, we did not talk enough about the significance of labor in creating the human world and the truth that it takes hard work to build socialism, so many people still despise labor to varying degrees, especially physical labor.
    We must realize that both physical labor and mental labor are glorious and indispensable for building socialism. Physical labor is the most fundamental labor. It is the means of creating material wealth, the foundation of social existence and development, and the source of creating a happy life and developing cultural and artistic and scientific undertakings. Without physical labor, human beings cannot survive at all. It must also be understood that at present, only a small number of people are engaged in mental labor, while the vast majority of people are engaged in physical labor. Under the current conditions in our country, the vast majority of people must be engaged in agricultural labor. Therefore, the idea of despising physical labor, especially despising agricultural labor, is extremely wrong. Regarding the correct relationship between physical laborers and mental laborers, we believe that they should be combined. Those engaged in physical labor should gradually improve their cultural and scientific level, so as to exert greater creativity in labor; those engaged in mental labor should try to take some time to participate in physical labor, so as to combine themselves more closely with physical laborers and exert greater creativity in labor. Therefore, we should advocate the close combination of physical laborers and mental laborers, and should gradually establish a system that combines mental labor with physical labor; in the future, the distinction between mental labor and physical labor will be eliminated. Labor is only a matter of division of labor and cooperation, and there is no distinction between noble and lowly. The so-called "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others," "all trades are lowly, only studying is high" are completely the ideas of the exploiting classes; all socialist laborers should resolutely eliminate this idea.
    Saving is an important way to expand socialist accumulation; especially in our country, where the economy and culture are still very backward, we must strive to save in order to carry out socialist construction. Therefore, we must carry out the conservation movement comprehensively and persistently. We women should consciously participate in this movement and pay attention to saving anytime and anywhere, from production, work to daily life, and firmly establish the idea that saving is glorious and waste is shameful. It must be realized that the people's living standards can only be gradually improved on the basis of the development of production and construction; and the speed of production and construction development must be higher than the speed of improvement of the people's lives, so that we can both expand reproduction and gradually improve people's lives on the basis of developing production. Otherwise, if we produce as much as we consume, or even consume limited capital, socialism will not be built.
    Therefore, diligence and thrift are the fundamental policies for our country to build socialism, and we women must work hard to increase production and practice strict economy. Female workers, peasant women, herdsmen women, female staff members, female handicraft workers, etc. in production positions must abide by the production plans of the state and cooperatives, actively participate in labor, strive to improve production technology, learn advanced experience, increase production, improve quality, and save raw materials, and strive to complete production tasks. Women in various work positions must strive to study their business and improve work efficiency, and gradually become proficient in their business. All women with low cultural levels, in order to improve their labor skills, must work hard to learn culture.
    Chairman Mao Zedong recently told us that we must mention diligence and thrift in managing the household together with diligence and thrift in running the cooperative, and love for the country and the cooperative should be mentioned together with love for the family. Therefore, we should regard diligence and thrift in managing the household as an important aspect of building the country through diligence and thrift, and as a basic method for women to support the country's socialist construction and build a new socialist family. In the period when our country is arduously building socialism, it is impossible for the people's lives to be improved quickly and greatly at once, and there must be difficulties. To overcome the difficulties in life and further improve our lives, we must not only participate in socialist construction diligently and thriftily and seek gradual solutions from the continuous development of the national economy; especially important is to rely on ourselves women, who are good at diligence and thrift in managing the household.
    Diligence and thrift in managing the household are of extremely great significance to China's socialist construction. The family is the cell of society, and all laborers participating in socialist construction live in families. Whether the family is managed well has a significant impact on the socialist enthusiasm of family members. If the family is well managed, the family members participating in socialist construction will "have no worries and concentrate on production"; if the family is not well managed, it will affect their production emotions, which will inevitably affect the completion of the national and cooperative production increase plans. A large part of all the means of livelihood produced by the state are consumed from the family, and whether the family can save also affects the supply of consumer goods by the state. If the family can pay attention to saving every bit from all aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, although the amount is not large when calculated from one family; but if the quantity saved by all families across the country is added up, a large amount of consumer goods can be saved for the state, so as to ease the tension in the supply of materials. Conversely, if many families live extravagantly and wastefully, it will promote the tight supply of national consumer goods and affect socialist construction. If the family can further make positive efforts to increase income and strive to save, it can increase the funds for national construction. Therefore, if the household is not diligent and thrifty, it will hinder the development of the entire national construction undertaking, and will expand the contradiction between the state, the collective, and the family. If the household can be diligent and thrifty, it will greatly help the entire country to increase production and save, and will make the interests of the state, the collective, and the family more consistent.
    Diligence and thrift in managing the household are not only of the above-mentioned great significance to building the country through diligence and thrift, but also have great benefits for the family itself. Diligence and thrift in managing the household can not only promote the improvement of family life, but also promote the harmony of family relations. Accumulating possibly saved surplus money and grain can prepare for emergencies and prevent unforeseen disasters. Diligence and thrift in managing the household can also cultivate children's habits of loving labor and being hardworking and simple, so that they can be well influenced by the family from an early age and become socialist successors who are good at building the country and managing the household through diligence and thrift. Diligence and thrift in managing the household will inevitably make family life good, which can enhance the harmony and unity between family members and establish a good lifestyle in society. This also shows that managing household affairs and managing the family have great social significance. In history, household labor has always been indispensable for the development of social production and for the survival and prosperity of every nation. In socialist society, household labor has greater social significance and has become an indispensable part of labor for socialist construction. Household labor, like social labor, is glorious labor. Therefore, in today's society, mothers and housewives are respected as never before. The bourgeois rightists maliciously slander socialist society for despising household labor, which is intentionally reversing right and wrong and creating ideological confusion. At present, it is true that some people despise household labor and are unwilling to engage in household labor. This wrong view is precisely the influence of the erroneous thinking of the exploiting classes who despise labor, despise women, and erase the achievements of the hard work of tens of thousands of women; the Party is educating the people from all aspects to strive to eliminate this thinking. Therefore, only under the leadership of the Party, in socialist society, can household labor be correctly evaluated and given due respect.
    The working people of our country have always had a good tradition of diligence and thrift. In the past few years, the work of promoting the "Five Goods" has accumulated new experience in diligence and thrift in managing the household. To sum up, to achieve diligence and thrift in managing the household, we should strive from the following two aspects:
    First, practice strict economy, make careful calculations, and live a planned life. In family life, we must always pay attention to saving all daily necessities and make full use of waste. Grain is the treasure of treasures in the construction undertaking. We should cherish every grain and try our best to save grain and achieve "eating sparingly and eating enough." In rural areas, every family should strive to have grain stored in good years, not lack grain in lean years, and ask for less grain in disaster years. We are a country with a population of more than 600 million. If everyone saves one or two ounces of grain every day, we can save 13.5 billion catties of grain throughout the year, which is not far from the 14.5 billion catties of grain produced in 1956. What a huge number this is! It is not very difficult for each family to save grain; but this is indeed of great significance to the country. Therefore, our women should regard cherishing grain and saving grain as a concrete manifestation of loving socialism. We must also cherish even one inch and one point of cotton cloth, turn old clothes into new ones, change large clothes into small ones, tailor clothes according to body size, and use various methods

    勤俭建国勤俭持家为建设社会主义而奋斗
    ——1957年9月9日章蕴同志在中国妇女第三次全国代表大会上的报告——
    各位代表：
    我们这次大会的主要任务是：总结四年来的妇女工作，确定今后的任务。现在我代表中华全国民主妇女联合会第二届执行委员会提出有关这个问题的报告，请大会审议。
    （一）祖国的伟大变革和妇女地位的巨大变化
    从1953年4月中国妇女第二次全国代表大会到现在，已经有四年多了，这是一个极其伟大的历史时期。在这期间，我国人民在中国共产党领导之下，根据国家在过渡时期的总路线，通过和平方法，基本上完成了对国民经济的社会主义改造，建立了社会主义的生产关系，解放了社会生产力。与此同时，我国社会主义建设事业有了迅速的发展，第一个发展国民经济的五年计划即将完成并超额完成，在工业、农业、交通运输业、商业、手工业、文化、教育、医药卫生、科学、艺术等各方面，都获得了伟大的成就，为国家的社会主义工业化打下了初步的基础。
    在这样翻天覆地的大革命和大建设中，我国各民族各阶层妇女群众，发扬了高度的爱国热情，用辛勤劳动的双手，做出了前所未有的巨大贡献，成为社会主义事业中不可缺少的重大力量，再一次证明了毛泽东主席指出的：妇女是决定革命胜败的一个力量。而在社会主义革命基本完成之后，我国妇女在政治的、经济的、文化的、社会的和家庭的生活各方面，已经享有同男子平等的权利，永远结束了几千年被压迫被奴役的惨痛历史，获得了妇女解放。
    四年多以来，特别是国家对国民经济的社会主义改造基本完成之后，我国各民族各阶层妇女的地位起了巨大变化。农民妇女是妇女中的最大多数，由于农业合作化的实现，广大农村妇女的经济生活，发生了比土地改革更加深刻的变化。在1956年，约有一亿二千余万农户的妇女，同男农民一起，参加了农业生产合作社，从事农业、牧业、副业生产，妇女们的劳动热情，空前高涨，劳动范围大大扩展，她们所得的劳动工分，一般地达到全社劳动工分总数的25％左右。随着农业生产合作社的生产发展和经营管理制度的逐步健全，男女同工同酬的原则，正在逐步实现。而她们在家务劳动和家庭副业生产方面，又作出了难以估计的巨大贡献。由于农村妇女的这种种努力，对于增加农、副业的生产，增加农民家庭的收入，支援祖国的工业建设，起了巨大的作用；同时显示了妇女的才能和智慧。因此，妇女在社会上和家庭里的经济地位大大提高了。妇女在家庭里一般地都能和男人共同当家作主，参与家庭经济管理。妇女在农业生产合作社里参加了领导工作，现在全国七十五万六千个农业生产合作社中，有70—80％的社有女社长或女副社长，约计有五十余万人，妇女担任社务委员及生产队长的，为数更多。
    广大的手工业妇女，积极参加了手工业合作化运动，1956年底已有150余万女手工业者组织在手工业生产合作组织中，约占男女社（组）员总数的30％左右。她们大都能克服困难，艰苦劳动，学习技术，努力增产，显示了自己在生产中的作用；因而她们在家庭中和社会上的经济地位也大大提高了。
    由于社会主义建设的迅速发展，女职工的队伍扩大了，1952年全国女职工约有150余万人，1956年底已达300余万人，比1952年增加了一倍。在社会主义工业生产和各项建设事业中，到处都有妇女们在那里辛勤劳动。她们同男职工在一起，取得了卓越成就，表现了工人阶级的集体英雄主义和创造历史的才能。仅1956年年底，全国各工矿企业中，就有11万余女职工被评选为先进生产者或先进工作者。随着生产的发展，职工们的工资正在逐步提高，男女同工同酬的原则已经实现，女职工的工资和男职工一样得到了提高；生老病死，有劳保福利的保障；女工的特有困难，得到了必要的照顾。
    作为工人阶级一部分的广大职工家属，对于我国工业生产和建设的发展，作出了光荣的贡献。她们勤俭持家，执行“五好”（勤俭持家好，团结互助好，教养子女好，清洁卫生好，努力学习好），努力支援职工的生产劳动，因此在职工们的劳动成果中，是包含着她们的功绩的。她们发挥互助互济精神，组织了劳动的、经济的互助，克服自身的困难。她们积极参加社会活动，为公众服务，受到了社会的尊敬。
    在资产阶级妇女中，大多数人是可能并正在接受社会主义改造，她们正从学习中、从参加社会实践中努力改造思想。在全行业实行公私合营时，女工商业者得到了安排，成为企业或国家机关的工作人员。工商业者家属的社会和家庭地位，也得到了提高。
    我国各族妇女积极地参加了国家事务的管理。全国极大多数妇女参加了五大运动和三大改造，参加了制订宪法的全民讨论，参加了1953年和1956年两届基层人民代表大会的选举运动。有愈来愈多的妇女积极分子，被人民选拔到各级国家机关的领导岗位上，这更加明显地标志着我国妇女已经从社会的奴隶变为社会的主人了。在基层人民代表大会中，妇女代表占了一定的比重。1953年全国举行第一次基层选举时，当选为基层人民代表的妇女占代表总数的17％；1956年全国第二次举行基层选举时，当选的女代表比例增加到20.3％，即共达100多万人。在全国人民代表大会中有女代表148人，占代表总数的12％；其中有少数民族妇女代表19人，占少数民族代表总数的11％。各族妇女代表都和男代表一起视察工作，讨论和决定全国的和各级地方的大政方针，并且对政府工作随时可以提出建议和批评。在国家行政机关中，妇女被选拔参加领导工作的，也在不断增加。现在，有不少妇女在国务院担任正副部长，司、局长；在省人民委员会担任副省长，正副厅、局长；在全国许多地方有了女县长、女市长、女州长、女旗长、女区长；而在基层政权中，妇女参加领导工作的人数更多，全国约有半数左右的乡有了妇女担任乡长或副乡长，全国各城市的居民委员会中，妇女干部占到干部总数的80％左右。全国还有一千多位女干部在各级法院中担任院长、庭长、审判员等工作。
    随着我国文化教育事业的发展，女知识分子日益增多了。1950年全国高等学校中仅有女教授、女讲师、女助教2，319人，到1956年已增至11，207人。中等学校的女教师已达37，761人（不包括中等师范学校女教师），小学校的女教师已达347，785人。在全国各级医药卫生技术人员中，妇女已达85万余人。在文化艺术人员中，在科学技术人员中，妇女逐年增加。从旧社会来的知识妇女之中，绝大多数人在各种社会运动和思想改造中，得到了锻炼，提高了政治觉悟，愿意为蒸蒸日上的社会主义祖国服务。
    各级学校都有大量的女学生，1956—1957年学年度，高等学校（包括研究生在内）有女学生100，374人，占学生总数的24.6％，而在高级医药卫生学校中女生比例高达42％。中等学校有女学生1，729，400余人，占学生总数29％。小学校有女生22，314，900余人，占学生总数的35％。这样大批的女性获得受教育的机会，是中国历史上从来没有的事情。广大劳动妇女正在努力提高文化，1956年全国已有890万人摆脱了文盲状态，其  中妇女约占半数。各种工作岗位上的妇女，她们边做边学，逐步增进了文化、科学知识和业务能力。
    社会上保护婚姻、家庭、母亲、儿童的新风气，更进一步地树立起来了。从1953年宣传贯彻婚姻法运动以来，新的婚姻和家庭关系日益发展和巩固了。保护妇女劳动力，保护儿童安全与健康，已引起社会上广泛的注意。儿童保育事业有了很大的发展，1956年年底全国城市各种托儿机构约有26，700多处，收托儿童125万余名，比1949年增加260倍。1956年，农忙托儿组织有了迅速的发展，收托儿童600余万人。这对于发挥母亲们的社会主义积极性，增进儿童身心健康，都起了重大的作用。
    所有这些活生生的事实证明，我国妇女已经从剥削阶级的奴役和压迫下翻过身来，和全国人民一起，成为国家的主人翁。这样翻天覆地的大变化，是中国共产党领导我国人民取得了人民民主革命和社会主义革命的胜利的结果；也是中国共产党正确的妇女运动方针的胜利的结果。这是任何资产阶级的政党所办不到的，也是不可能办到的。妇联的各级组织，也正是在党的领导下，执行了党的发动妇女和男子一道参加各项革命运动和各种建设事业的方针，才使自己的工作获得了很大成绩的。全国妇女只有在中国共产党的领导下走社会主义的道路，才团结成为能够掌握自己的命运的力量，妇女们长期被压抑被湮没的聪明才智，才得到了充分的发挥；她们在社会上和家庭中的地位，才发生了这样巨大的变化。历史的经验充分证明了：只有共产党才是全国人民的领导核心，才是全国妇女的解放者。只有跟共产党走社会主义的道路，才是妇女解放的唯一的道路。
    （二）现阶段我国妇女的任务
    当1956年我国在经济战线上取得了社会主义革命的基本胜利之后，现阶段我国人民、我国妇女的总任务，就是继续建成和巩固我国的社会主义制度，在政治战线上和思想战线上继续取得社会主义革命的彻底胜利；就是集中一切力量来发展我国的社会生产力，尽可能迅速地把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。
    社会主义改造的基本完成，实现了社会经济制度的伟大变革，这是一个具有划时代意义的胜利。但是，正如毛泽东主席告诉我们的：我国的社会主义制度还建立不久，还没有完全建成，还不完全巩固，还需要有一个继续建成和巩固的过程。我国的社会主义革命，虽然在经济战线上是基本胜利了，但是在政治战线上和思想战线上全国人民同资产阶级右派之间的激烈斗争还正在进行，在这两条战线上社会主义和资本主义谁战胜谁的问题，还没有完全解决。这个斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决。我们如果不在这个斗争中取得完全的胜利，那么，我们在政治制度、经济制度上已经取得的社会主义革命的胜利，还是不巩固的。因而妇女获得根本解放的伟大成果，也是不巩固的。正因为这样，现阶段我国人民、我国妇女的任务，就是要努力争取这个斗争的完全的彻底的胜利。
    今年，我国人民即将完成并超额地完成第一个发展国民经济的五年计划，这是在社会主义建设方面所获得的伟大胜利，但是这仅仅为我国社会主义建设打下了初步基础，社会主义社会还没有建成。1956年9月中国共产党第八次全国代表大会关于政治报告的决议指出，我们国内的一个主要的矛盾，就是人民对于建立先进的工业国的要求同落后的农业国的现实之间的矛盾，因此， “党和全国人民的当前的主要任务，就是要集中力量来解决这个矛盾，把我国尽快地从落后的农业国变为先进的工业国。”党中央委员会向党的第八次全国代表大会的政治报告中指出，要完成社会主义工业化的伟大任务，“将需要大约三个五年计划的时间。第一个五年计划的实践证明，为了完成国家的工业化，三个五年计划的时间是必要的，或者还需要更多一点时间。”在我国现在的基础上，只有再经过十年到十五年的艰苦努力，社会生产力才能得到比较充分的发展，社会主义的经济制度和政治制度才能获得比较充分的物质基础，我们的国家才算真正巩固，社会主义社会才算是在根本上建成了。
    以上就是我们全国人民要集中全力去完成的主要任务。我们占人口半数的三亿以上的已经获得解放的妇女，对于建设社会主义的伟大祖国，负有极重要的责任。建成社会主义工业化的国家，这是全国人民、全国妇女的最高利益所在。只有随着社会主义建设的胜利发展和社会主义社会的最后建成，全国人民才能逐步地摆脱目前的贫困、落后的状态，才能逐步地获得物质和文化生活的改善，妇女和儿童，才能有更美好、更幸福的未来。
    我国社会主义建设是异常巨大而又十分艰苦的工程。现在我们的建设虽然获得了伟大成就，但是旧中国遗留下来的经济文化落后状态还没有根本改变，工农业生产水平都还很低，每年都有一些地区遭受自然灾害；我国人民的生活逐年有所改善，但是人口众多，旧中国遗留下来的穷贫状态，还需要很长时间才能得到根本的改变，我们进行建设的技术、科学、文化力量还是薄弱的，我们的建设资金还是少的；因此，我们要建成社会主义，必须执行毛泽东主席所指示的勤俭建国的方针。要勤俭办厂，勤俭办社，勤俭办一切事业；还要勤俭持家。而我们妇女对于勤俭持家，更担负着特殊重要的责任。所以，勤俭建国、勤俭持家，为建设社会主义而奋斗，是今后我国妇女运动的根本方针。
    （三）我们要坚定不移地走社会主义道路
    代表们！当我们在这里举行第三次全国妇女代表大会的这个时刻，在我们全国各城市，反击资产阶级右派的说理斗争正在继续扩展和深入；在城市和农村，正在进行一次大规模的社会主义教育，在农村里，还要反击不法地主、富农分子、反革命分子和其他坏分子的反社会主义的言论和行动。这是继去年在经济战线上（在生产资料所有制上）的社会主义革命胜利之后，在政治战线上和思想战线上的伟大的社会主义革命。我们只有在这两条战线上取得了彻底的胜利，我们的社会主义经济制度和政治制度才能更加巩固，我们的社会主义建设事业才能在可靠的基础上胜利发展。
    资产阶级右派和全国人民完全处在对立的地位。资产阶级右派分子和其他反共、反社会主义分子企图推翻共产党的领导和推翻社会主义制度，这是我国人民、我国妇女所决不能容许的。事情很明白，只有在共产党的领导下走社会主义的道路，才能有我国人民和我国妇女的解放。如果离开了社会主义道路，我国就必定要回到半殖民地半封建的黑暗道路上去，我国人民、我国妇女就要从国家的主人地位重新变为奴隶牛马。因此，我们同资产阶级右派的斗争是根本不可能调和的。为了我们社会主义国家的利益，为了我们人民的利益，为了妇女解放的利益，我们必须坚决地同资产阶级右派作斗争，不获全胜，决不收兵。
    同资产阶级右派进行的这一场斗争，对我们每一个人来说，都是严重的考验。我们绝大多数的女工、农妇和其他劳动妇女是热烈拥护共产党、拥护社会主义制度的，是坚决地走社会主义道路的。因此，当资产阶级右派猖狂地向共产党和社会主义进攻的时候，她们奋起反击；在有关社会主义和资本主义两条道路的全民大辩论中，她们能够清楚地认识，走社会主义道路好得很，走资本主义道路是死路一条。但是即使在劳动妇女中，也有一部分人，主要是一部分农村中的富裕中农家庭妇女，对社会主义制度还有很大抵触，她们向往资本主义发财致富的道路。也有一部分人还有从旧社会带来的个人主义思想，当个人利益同国家利益、集体利益发生冲突的时候，她们往往把自己个人的利益放在第一位。至于资产阶级和资产阶级知识界妇女，除了已经并正在揭露出来的一批右派分子以外，绝大多数人都是愿意和可能接受社会主义改造的；但是对于她们中间的多数人，有一个放弃资产阶级的立场和世界观而转变到工人阶级的立场和世界观的问题，这问题是还没有解决或者还没有完全解决的。因此，她们中间的许多人，当资产阶级右派发动猖狂进攻的时候，一时分不清是非，甚至附和了右派分子的言论和行动。这就可见，我们每一个妇女都要在政治上思想上过社会主义这一关，都要在目前正在展开的关于社会主义和资本主义两条道路的大辩论中，清除旧思想，提高社会主义的觉悟。只有这样，我们才能在社会主义的道路上胜利前进。在过去长期革命斗争中，我们妇女和男子一起过了人民革命战争的关，又过了土地改革的关，去年又在基本上过了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造的一关。这几个关，我们绝大多数妇女是过得好的，而且在这个过程中，我们锻炼了自己的革命意志，提高了自己的政治觉悟。现在的问题就是在于我们还要在政治战线上和思想战线上过社会主义革命这一关，就是在于我们还要改造旧思想，来适应新制度。
    毛泽东主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话中指出的六项标准，就是指引我们在思想上和政治上过社会主义这一关的准则，就是我们改造思想的准则，就是我们言论行动的准则。毛泽东主席所指出的在现阶段判断我们的言论和行动的是非的六项标准就是：“（一）有利于团结全国各族人民，而不是分裂人民；（二）有利于社会主义改造和社会主义建设，而不是不利于社会主义改造和社会主义建设；（三）有利于巩固人民民主专政，而不是破坏或者削弱这个专政；（四）有利于巩固民主集中制，而不是破坏或者削弱这个制度；（五）有利于巩固共产党的领导，而不是摆脱或者削弱这种领导；（六）有利于巩固社会主义的国际团结和全世界爱好和平人民的国际团结，而不是有损于这些团结。这六条标准中，最重要的是社会主义道路和党的领导两条。”毛泽东主席又指示我们说，我们处理人民内部问题、包括人民的自我思想改造问题的方法，是民主的即说服教育的方法，是“团结—批评—团结”的方法。我们应当根据毛泽东主席所指出的六项标准，并且坚持“团结—批评—团结”的方法，来改造自己的思想，同时也帮助别人改造，使我们妇女和全国人民一样，都能在思想上和政治上过好社会主义这一关，使我们大家都能在社会主义的基础上更加紧密地团结起来。
    为了过好社会主义这一关，对于剥削阶级出身的妇女来说，首要的关键，就是转变阶级立场。她们必须自觉地抛弃旧的剥削阶级的立场，而站到工人阶级和社会主义的立场上来。她们中间现在已经有一小部分人基本上完成了或者正在完成这种转变，其他的人也应当自觉地实现这种立场的转变。为了从政治上思想上清除剥削阶级的旧思想，要彻底地破资本主义、巩固地立社会主义，她们还必须努力地在实际工作和劳动中，在同工农群众结合和向工农群众学习中把她们的旧的世界观改造过来，只有这样，她们才能同社会主义的新制度相适应，从而为祖国的社会主义建设积极地贡献自己的力量。
    对于广大劳动妇女来说，要过好社会主义这一关，首先是必须明辨两条道路的大是大非问题，彻底批判资本主义思想，端正政治方向，只有走社会主义道路，我们才有无限美好的前途。其次是克服个人主义思想，把个人利益同集体利益、国家利益的互相关系处理得正确。在社会主义社会中，每一个社会成员的个人利益同集体利益、国家利益之间，在根本上是一致的，党和政府的政策，始终是兼顾国家利益、集体利益和每一个社会成员的个人利益的。但是在某些时候，特别是当某些社会成员离开国家利益和集体利益而片面地追求个人利益的时候，或者是当集体和国家发生某些困难，而某些社会成员又不了解这种困难的时候，个人利益同集体利益、国家利益之间，是存在着矛盾的。在这种时候，我们就必须把国家利益和集体利益放在第一位，使个人利益服从国家和集体的利益。只有这样，我们才能完全愉快地、积极地、毫不动摇地跟着共产党走社会主义的道路。
    代表们！我们妇女占人口半数，我们的思想和认识，不仅支配着我们自己的行动，还可以影响我们的子女和丈夫。我们不但必须积极地同资产阶级右派分子作斗争，而且必须进行自我改造，使自己在政治上思想上过好社会主义这一关，从而影响和帮助我们的亲人也过好社会主义这一关。我们在政治战线上和思想战线上同资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，我们人民群众的自我改造，都是一个长期的艰巨的斗争过程。但是只要我们大家坚决地积极地努力，这个斗争过程是可能缩短的。我们一定要巩固地树立社会主义的思想，坚定不移地跟着共产党走社会主义的道路。我们一定要取得政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命的全部的彻底的胜利。
    （四）勤俭建国，俭勤持家
    勤俭建国是党和政府领导全国人民进行社会主义建设的根本方针，这个方针的能否贯彻执行是关系我国社会主义建设的关键问题；所以我们妇女一定要和全国人民一起，自觉地积极地为执行这个方针而努力。毛泽东主席说：“勤俭经营……应当是一切经济事业的方针。勤俭办工厂，勤俭办商店，勤俭办一切国营事业和合作事业，勤俭办一切其他事业，什么事情都应当执行勤俭的原则。……中国是一个大国，但是现在还很穷，要使中国富起来，需要几十年时间。几十年以后也需要执行勤俭的原则，但是特别要提倡勤俭，特别要注意节约的，是在目前这几十年内，是在目前这几个五年计划的时期内。”这就是毛泽东主席就我国建设社会主义的根本方针问题所作的极为重要的指示。我们无论办什么事业都要贯彻勤劳和节俭的方针。勤就是辛勤劳动，俭就是厉行节约；勤可以增加生产，增加收入；俭可以减少消费，增加积累；两者结合起来，既可以建好国，又可以持好家。所以勤俭对于建成社会主义有极为重大的意义。就妇女对劳动的认识来说，几年来，特别是社会主义改造基本完成之后，妇女们的劳动光荣的观点，有了显著的提高，劳动积极性空前高涨。她们在各种生产、工作岗位上和家庭里，都创造了重大的成就，涌现出许多劳动模范、社会主义建设积极分子和“五好”积极分子。但是地主、资产阶级的轻视劳动的错误观点，在群众中还有影响，再加上我们过去对妇女群众的宣传教育工作中，对劳动创造人类世界的意义和必须付出艰苦的劳动才能建成社会主义的道理讲得不够，因而不少人还不同程度地轻视劳动，特别是轻视体力劳动。
    我们必须认识体力劳动和脑力劳动，都是光荣的，都是建设社会主义所不可缺少的。而体力劳动又是最根本的劳动，它是创造物质财富的手段，是社会存在和发展的基础，是创造幸福生活、发展文化艺术和科学事业的源泉，没有体力劳动，人类就根本不能生存。而且必须了解，目前专门从事脑力劳动的只是一小部分人，从事体力劳动的则是绝大部分人。在我国目前的条件下，又必须有绝大部分人从事农业劳动。所以轻视体力劳动，特别是轻视农业劳动的思想，是极端错误的。关于体力劳动者和脑力劳动者的正确关系，我们认为应当是两者结合起来。从事体力劳动的，要逐步提高文化科学水平，在劳动中才能发挥更大的创造性；从事脑力劳动的，应该尽可能抽出一定时间，参加体力劳动，使自己更密切地结合体力劳动者，在劳动中才能发挥更大的作用。因此，我们就应当宣传体力劳动者和脑力劳动者密切地结合起来，并且应当逐步建立脑力劳动同体力劳动相结合的制度；在将来脑力劳动同体力劳动的区别则是要消灭的。劳动只有分工合作的关系，没有贵贱的区别。所谓“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”，“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”，完全是剥削阶级的思想；一切社会主义的劳动者应该坚决清除这种思想。
    节约，是扩大社会主义积累的一种重要方法；特别在我国，经济文化还很落后，要进行社会主义建设，必须力求节省。所以，我们一定要全面地持久地开展节约运动，我们妇女应当自觉地参加这一运动，从生产上，工作上以至日常生活中，随时随地注意节约，巩固地树立节约光荣、浪费可耻的思想。必须认识，人民生活水平只能在生产和建设发展的基础上，逐步提高；而且生产和建设的发展的速度必须高过人民生活改善的速度，这才能一方面扩大再生产，一方面在发展生产的基础上逐步地改善人民生活。否则，如果生产多少，就消费掉多少，甚至消费掉有限的老本钱，社会主义就会建不成的。
    所以勤劳和节俭，是我国建成社会主义的根本方针，我们妇女一定要努力增产，厉行节约。在生产岗位上的女工、农民妇女、牧民妇女、女职员、女手工业者等等，都要遵照国家和合作社的生产计划，积极参加劳动，努力提高生产技术，学习先进经验，增加生产，提高质量，节约原材料，为完成生产任务而努力。在各种工作岗位上的妇女，都要努力钻研业务，提高工作效率，逐步做到精通业务。一切文化水平低的妇女，为了提高劳动本领，都要努力学习文化。
    毛泽东主席最近告诉我们，必须把勤俭持家同勤俭办社并提，爱国爱社应当和爱家并提。因此，我们应当把勤俭持家作为勤俭建国的一个重要方面，作为妇女们支持国家的社会主义建设和建设社会主义新家庭的基本方法。在我国艰苦地建设社会主义的时期，人民的生活是不可能一下子很快地很大地改善的，困难也一定是有的，我们要克服生活上的困难和进一步改善生活，不仅要克勤克俭地参加社会主义建设，从不断发展国民经济的过程中求得逐步的解决；特别重要的还要依靠我们妇女自己，善于勤俭持家。
    勤俭持家，对于我国的社会主义建设事业有着极其重大的意义。家庭是社会的细胞，一切参加社会主义建设的劳动者，都是生活在家庭里的，家庭主持得好坏，对于家庭成员的社会主义积极性，有重大的影响。如果家庭治理得好，参加社会主义建设的家庭成员就“没有后顾之忧，一心一意搞生产”；如果家庭治理得不好，就要影响他们的生产情绪，从而也就势必要影响到国家和合作社增产计划的完成。国家生产的一切生活资料，很大部分是从家庭里消费的，家庭能否节俭，也影响国家消费物资的供应情况。如果家庭里能从衣、食、住、行各方面注意一点一滴的节约，从一个家庭来计算，数目虽然是不大的；但是若把全国所有的家庭所节约的数量加起来，就能为国家省出大批的消费物资，以缓和物资供应的紧张情况。反过来说，如果很多家庭生活铺张浪费，就要促使国家消费物资供应紧张，影响社会主义建设。家庭里如果能够更进一步地作到积极开源，努力储蓄，那就更能为国家增加建设的资金。因此持家而不勤俭，就要妨害整个国家建设事业的发展，就要扩大国家、集体同家庭之
  间的矛盾。持家而能勤俭，就大大有助于整个国家的增产节约，就能使国家、集体同家庭利益更趋于一致。
    勤俭持家，不仅对勤俭建国有着上述的重大的意义，同时对家庭本身也有莫大的好处。勤俭持家，不仅能够促进家庭生活的改善，还能够促进家庭关系的和协，积累可能节省的余钱剩米，就可以备不时之需，防不测之患。勤俭持家，还能养成子女热爱劳动、艰苦朴素的习惯，使他们从小就受到家庭良好的影响，成为善于勤俭建国、勤俭持家的社会主义接班人。勤俭持家，必然使家庭生活过得好，这样就能够增进家庭成员之间的和睦团结，在社会上树立起良好的生活作风。由此，也说明操持家务，管理家庭，是具有重大的社会意义的。在历史上，家务劳动对于社会生产的发展，对于每一个民族的生存和繁荣，从来就是不可缺少的。而在社会主义社会里，家务劳动有了更大的社会意义，成为社会主义建设的劳动中不可缺少的一部分，家务劳动和社会劳动一样，都是光荣的劳动。因此在今天社会里，母亲们、主妇们受到了前所未有的尊重。资产阶级右派分子恶毒地诽谤社会主义社会是轻视家务劳动的，这是有意颠倒是非，制造思想混乱。目前确有些人是轻视家务劳动的，不愿从事家务劳动，这种错误的看法，正是剥削阶级轻视劳动、轻视妇女、抹煞成千成万妇女辛勤劳动的成果的一种错误思想的影响；党正在从各方面教育人民努力清除这种思想。所以只有在党的领导之下，在社会主义社会里，家务劳动才得到了正确的估价和应有的尊重。
    我国劳动人民历来就有勤劳节俭的优良传统，几年来推行“五好”的工作中，又积累了勤俭持家的新经验，综合起来说，要做到勤俭持家，应当从下列两方面来努力：
    第一，厉行节约，精打细算，有计划地过生活。在家庭生活中，要随时随地注意节约一切日常生活用品，并充分利用废物。粮食是建设事业中的宝中之宝，我们应当爱惜一颗一粒的粮食，想尽各种办法节约用粮，做到“吃得省，吃得饱。”在农村，每一个家庭要争取做到丰年有存粮，歉年不缺粮，灾年少要粮。我们是一个六亿以上人口的国家，如果每人每天节约一两粮食，全年就能节约135亿斤粮食，同1956年全国增产的145亿斤粮食比较，相差不远。这是一个多么巨大的数目！家庭节约粮食，对每一个家庭来说，并不是十分困难的；但这对国家来说，的确有重大的作用。因此我们妇女要把爱惜粮食、节约粮食看成是热爱社会主义的具体表现。我们还要爱惜那怕是一寸一分的棉布，翻旧改新，以大改小，量体裁衣，用各种办法来节省布匹；我们要用这样克勤克俭的精神来节省棉布。水电、煤炭都是国家建设的重要物资，也要力求节约。我们要把节约变成人们自觉的行动，使艰苦朴素的优良作风成为普遍的社会风气。
    我们还要精打细算，计划好家庭生活，把钱花在最需要的地方，必须花的钱才花，能少花的钱少花，不应花的钱，绝不浪费。只有这样，家庭生活才能安排好。有些“五好”积极分子的家庭，当她没有执行“五好”，没有精打细算、计划好家庭生活的时候，虽然丈夫的工资不少，但是钱老不够用，富三天穷半月。没钱花，就向组织上借、标会、欠债，夫妻经常吵架。当她们省吃俭用、精打细算、计划好家庭生活之后，逐步地把债还清了，会不标了，家里添了人口还有积蓄，逐步做到了细水长流，穿吃不愁。他们高兴地说：“从前借债过生活，吃肉不长肉，现在省吃俭用，计划生活，一家大小，有说有笑。”因此，我们要把精打细算，计划好家庭经济开支，重视储蓄，当成一种生活制度，养成为一种良好的习惯。
    第二，在可能的条件下，积极地开展多种多样的家庭副业生产。家庭副业生产是适合妇女从事的一种生产。特别是农村，家庭副业生产收入在家庭收入中都占了相当大的比重。在农村，从提倡开展多种经济以后，家庭副业生产被重视了，许多妇女积极养猪养鸡，努力开展各种可能开展的副业生产，这样，家庭收入增加了，日常零用钱也不困难了，再不用经常向合作社要钱要粮了。许多城市根据需要和可能，在职工家属和街道妇女中组织了各种各样的生产小组，开展了多种多样的家庭副业生产，增加了家庭收入。这样，原来依靠工会救济的，不要救济了，领补助金的自动取消了。许多城乡妇女这样努力的结果，不仅减少了国家开支，生活也改善了。所以我们认为应当根据可能，开展多种多样的家庭副业生产。在农村里，应当根据妇女的劳动能力和生产技术，根据生产合作社的计划以及当地的条件，合理地安排妇女劳动力，有些妇女主要参加农副业生产，有些妇女则主要参加家庭副业生产，发挥妇女们的特长，以便增加家庭收入，改善自己的生活，同时减少国家和合作社的负担。
    勤俭持家，是家庭全体成员共同的责任，必须依靠全家男女老少一齐努力，而家庭主妇更要负主要责任。家庭妇女要操持家务，参加社会劳动的妇女也要兼顾家务。广大劳动妇女在家庭生活中积累了操持家务、管理家务的丰富的经验，她们之中有很多勤俭持家的能手。为了社会主义建设的利益，为了家庭成员的幸福，我们妇女一定要充分发挥这种特长，传播这种好的经验，逐渐使我们大家都会勤俭持家。生长在社会主义建设时代的青年是幸福的，国家给青年的成长创造了一切优越的条件。但是有些青年没有像前辈那样懂得生活的艰难，懂得“柴米油盐”来之不易。针对着这种情况，凡是作父母的必须教育青年特别是青年妇女懂得勤俭持家在国家建设中的重大意义，重视家务劳动，学习勤俭持家的本领，树立艰苦朴素，勤劳节约的生活习惯。
