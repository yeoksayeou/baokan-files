Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 17th -- Personnel from the Hunan Provincial Department of Justice exposed and criticized the anti-Communist and anti-socialist malicious words and deeds of Lu Lanxin, the former head of the Civil Trial Panel of the Hunan Provincial People's Court.

The rightist Lu Lanxin, during the period of blooming and contending, tried his best to denigrate the judicial reform work, slandering Hunan's judicial reform as "having been ruined," and that the judicial reform was "kicking away" the old judicial personnel; that the judicial department's "leadership level is low" and "getting worse year by year." Therefore, he advocated a "re-examination" of the judicial reform work, attempting to overturn the great achievements of the judicial reform in the "re-examination." Lu Lanxin also tried his best to restore the soul of the pseudo-"Six Laws." He denied the class nature of law, saying that "socialist law and capitalist law are not essentially different," and that "law has continuity, and the laws before liberation can still be used now," openly declaring: "I do not obey anything about class or no class." He said, "Judicial work does not need to emphasize standpoints; I feel disgusted as soon as I hear about emphasizing these things in judging cases now."

Lu Lanxin knew that the Communist Party would not allow the restoration of the old judicial system and old laws, so he strongly opposed the Communist Party's leadership over judicial work. He said: "Only by not listening to the leadership of the Party Committee and making your own decisions is it called independent trial."

In response to these malicious fallacies of Lu Lanxin, the vast number of cadres in the Department of Justice used various facts to refute them powerfully in meetings, big-character posters, and blackboards. Everyone pointed out that some wrong cases did occur in Hunan Province before the judicial reform, but most of them were handled by the old judicial personnel. After the judicial reform, judicial work has advanced by leaps and bounds. In the second half of last year, most counties in the province had already eliminated the phenomenon of wrong cases. Therefore, Lu Lanxin's claim that the judicial reform was "ruined" is completely a malicious fabrication. Everyone pointed out that in the judicial reform, the people's government made proper arrangements for the old judicial personnel, and leniently dealt with the criminals among them. Only 1.3% of the old judicial personnel were sentenced because of their serious crimes, and some were sent home because of their bad character, etc. The vast majority of the rest were arranged to do other work, and a few were still retained for judicial work, and Lu Lanxin was one of them. Therefore, Lu Lanxin's statement of "kicking away" the old judicial personnel is obviously a malicious obliteration of facts. At the same time, everyone pointed out that thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party, the province's judicial work has achieved great success. There are now more than 16,000 people's assessors in the province. All cases in the province, except those involving state secrets and personal privacy, are tried publicly. In the first half of this year, publicly tried cases accounted for 66.2% of all cases. All these achievements cannot be erased by the rightists.

Everyone cited many facts to refute Lu Lanxin's fallacy of "law has continuity." According to revelations, Lu Lanxin used his fallacy of "law has continuity" during the rent reduction and deposit refund movement after liberation, openly declaring in his legal explanations that the "25% Rent Reduction" order issued by the Kuomintang Executive Yuan was "still valid." Lu Lanxin boasted that he had not made any wrong cases after liberation. However, according to everyone's revelations, he had occurred eight times in judging cases and making legal explanations after liberation, such as sheltering landlords and capitalists and maintaining the feudal marriage system. For example, when answering a question in a case, he actually declared that the debts owed by farmers to landlords before liberation "should be repaid immediately."

According to revelations, Lu Lanxin became a traitor to the Communist Youth League after the failure of the Great Revolution. Afterwards, he served as a judge, clerk, and acting chief clerk of the pseudo-local court and the pseudo-high court for fourteen years, and also served as a member of the Kuomintang district branch, faithfully serving the Kuomintang reactionaries.

Now, Lu Lanxin has made partial explanations for his reactionary words and deeds, and the cadres of the Department of Justice are continuing to conduct ideological struggle against him.

　　湖南司法改革成绩巨大  右派恶意诬蔑不值一驳
　　湖南司法厅干部列举有力的事实痛斥鲁兰馨无耻的诽谤
    据新华社长沙17日电　湖南省司法厅人员揭露和批判了原湖南省人民法院民事庭审判组长鲁兰馨的反共反社会主义的恶毒言行。
    右派分子鲁兰馨在大放大鸣中竭力诋毁司法改革工作，诬蔑湖南的司法改革“改坏了”，司法改革是把旧司法人员“一脚踢开”；司法部门“领导水平低”，“一年不如一年”。因此，他主张对司法改革工作来一个“复查”，企图在“复查”中推翻司法改革的巨大成果。鲁兰馨还竭力为伪“六法”招魂。他否认法律的阶级性，说“社会主义法律和资本主义法律没有本质的不同”，“法律有继承性，解放前的法律现在还可以用”，公开宣称：“我不服从什么阶级不阶级。”他说，“司法工作不需要强调立场观点，现在审判案子强调这些，我一听就反感。”
    鲁兰馨知道共产党不会让旧司法制度和旧法复辟，因此极力反对共产党对司法工作的领导。他说：“只有不听党委的领导，自己作主，才叫独立审判。”
    针对鲁兰馨这些恶毒的谬论，司法厅广大干部在会上和大字报、黑板报上，用各种事实进行了有力的驳斥。大家指出，湖南省在司法改革以前的确发生了一些错案，但绝大部分是旧司法人员办的。司法改革以后，司法工作突飞猛进，去年下半年，全省绝大部分县就已经消灭了错案现象。因此，鲁兰馨所谓司法改革“改坏了”的说法，完全是恶意的捏造。大家指出，在司法改革中，人民政府对旧司法人员作了妥善的安排，对其中的犯罪分子也从宽处理。旧司法人员中，只有1.3％的人因为罪恶深重被判刑，有的人因为品质恶劣等原因被遣散回家，其余大部分人安排作其他工作，少数人仍旧留作司法工作，鲁兰馨就是一个。因此，鲁兰馨所谓对旧司法人员“一脚踢开”的说法，显然是在恶意的抹杀事实。大家同时指出，由于共产党的领导，全省司法工作已经取得伟大成就。现在全省共有人民陪审员一万六千多人。全省的案件，除了牵涉到国家机密以及牵涉到个人阴私等的案件以外，都是公开审判的，今年上半年公开审判的案件就占全部案件66.2％。所有这些成就是右派分子抹杀不了的。
    大家举出许多事实，驳斥了鲁兰馨所谓“法律有继承性”的谬论。据揭露，鲁兰馨在解放后的减租退押运动中，运用他的“法律有继承性”的谬论，公然在作法律解答时宣称：过去国民党行政院颁布的“二五减租”通令“仍然有效”。鲁兰馨吹嘘他解放以后没有办错过案件。但据大家揭露，他在解放后在判案和作法律解答中，就曾经发生包庇地主、资本家和维护封建婚姻制度等事件八起。例如他在解答一个案件中的问题时，竟然宣称农民解放前欠地主的债“应即归还”。
    据揭露，鲁兰馨在大革命失败后就作了共青团的叛徒。以后他历任伪地方法院、伪高等法院的推事、书记官、代理书记官长等职务十四年，并且当过国民党区分部委员，为国民党反动派忠实服务。
    现在，鲁兰馨对他的反动言行已作了部分交代，司法厅干部正在继续对他进行说理斗争。
