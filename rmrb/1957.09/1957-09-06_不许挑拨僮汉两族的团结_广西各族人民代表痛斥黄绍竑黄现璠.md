Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 5th: Rightist Huang Shaohong's Great Han chauvinist views and Zhuang rightist Huang Xianfan's local nationalist words and deeds were fiercely criticized by representatives of all ethnic groups at the 5th session of the First Guangxi Provincial People's Congress, which closed on the 4th.

Huang Shaohong did not attend this meeting, but he has consistently opposed the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. He has always believed that "Guangxi has no ethnic minorities" and does not recognize the existence of the Zhuang ethnicity. During the preparation for the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, he claimed to be speaking as a "representative" of the Han people, constantly talking about the need to consider the political rights of the Han people and repeatedly mentioning the need to take care of the Han people's sense of superiority. When the people of all ethnic groups in the province agreed to establish the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, he still insisted on adding the word "Province" to the name of the autonomous region to take care of the "national feelings" of the Han people. He advocated not publicizing the policy of national regional autonomy and using bourgeois voting methods to test the Han people's opinion on the establishment of the autonomous region. Otherwise, he believed that the Han masses would rise up in demonstrations and petitions against the government. Representatives of the Han people from Rong County and Guilin refuted Huang Shaohong's absurdities at the meeting. The representatives pointed out that the "Han masses" represented by Huang Shaohong could only be the dead bureaucratic landlord class, not the working Han people. The representatives attending the meeting pointed out that, according to historical records, the Zhuang people existed in Guangxi before the Han people. They have lived in the same region for generations, with their own language, culture, and art, and distinct ethnic characteristics. Why is Huang Shaohong unwilling to see these facts clearly? It turns out he believes: "Would Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi agree with what you are doing (referring to the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region)?" This is his true intention. Zhuang representatives Nong Kang and others warned Huang Shaohong: "Now it is the People's Republic of China. The masters are the people of all ethnic groups, not the Republic of China under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek and the Li-Bai clique. That era is gone forever."

Zhuang rightist Huang Xianfan, taking advantage of his status as a deputy to the National People's Congress, spread many narrow nationalist remarks while inspecting rural areas in western Guangxi, in order to provoke unity between the Zhuang and Han nationalities. Huang Xianfan, with no conscience, told the local Zhuang masses in Daxin, Tianyang, Tiandong, and other counties: "The whole country has been liberated, only the Zhuang people have not been liberated. The lives of six million Zhuang people are in the hands of a few Han cadres." He also distorted historical facts, saying that the backwardness of ethnic minorities was caused by the Han people. In Tianyang and other counties, he incited Zhuang students, saying: "Your education is not only to improve your culture, but also for political emancipation." During the publicity and discussion of the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, he vigorously incited the Zhuang masses, saying: "If they (referring to the Han people) don't cooperate with us, we'll do it ourselves." On other occasions, Huang Xianfan blatantly distorted the Communist Party's policy of nationalization of organs, saying that "after the autonomous region is established, we don't need Han cadres." He also stirred up trouble, attacking ethnic minority veteran cadres and Communist Party cadres. In addition to frantically undermining Zhuang-Han unity and cooperation, Huang Xianfan also maliciously attacked the government's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and the agricultural cooperativization movement during his inspection. Zhang Shengzhen, Qin Hui, and more than a dozen Zhuang representatives refuted Huang Xianfan, saying: Ethnic minority cadres account for more than 55% of the total number of cadres in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture. Among the 169 positive and deputy county (city) heads in the prefecture, ethnic cadres account for 145 people. The governor of Guangxi Province and the head of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture are both Zhuang. What "political emancipation" is Huang Xianfan referring to? Another Zhuang representative, Liang Huanwen, pointed out: After liberation, with the help of the Han people, Guixi's economy and culture have greatly developed. By 1956, the total industrial output value of the prefecture had increased thirty times compared to before liberation. The total grain output exceeded the highest annual output before liberation by more than 30%. Thanks to the creation and promotion of the Zhuang language, the old face of Zhuang cultural backwardness has begun to change. What is Huang Xianfan's intention in referring to "national liberation"? Many representatives pointed out that Huang Xianfan, as a history professor at Guangxi Normal College, confused the Han ruling class that ruled the ethnic minorities in history with the Han masses, and deliberately portrayed class oppression as national oppression. What exactly is he trying to achieve?

After sixteen days of exposure, criticism, and debate by representatives of all ethnic groups, Huang Xianfan finally admitted that his words were all lies and were reactionary, anti-Communist, and anti-people words and deeds; his purpose was to gain prestige among ethnic minorities in order to obtain a higher political position.

Now, Huang Xianfan has expressed remorse for his behavior of undermining national unity and is willing to bow his head and confess his guilt to the people of all ethnic groups.

### 不许挑拨僮汉两族的团结  广西各族人民代表痛斥黄绍竑黄现璠

    不许挑拨僮汉两族的团结
    广西各族人民代表痛斥黄绍竑黄现璠
    据新华社南宁5日电　右派分子黄绍竑的大汉族主义论调和僮族右派分子黄现璠的地方民族主义言行，在4日闭幕的广西省第一届人民代表大会第五次会议上受到了各族人民代表的痛斥。
    黄绍竑没有参加这一次会议，但是他一直反对成立广西僮族自治区。他一贯认为“广西没有少数民族”，不承认僮族的存在。在建立广西僮族自治区的酝酿过程中，他自称是“代表”汉族说话，张口要考虑汉族的政治权利，闭嘴说要照顾汉族的优越感。当全省各族人民都同意建立广西僮族自治区的时候，他最后还要坚持在自治区的名称上加一个“省”字，来照顾汉族的“民族感情”。他主张不宣传民族区域自治政策，用资产阶级的投票方式来测验汉族对成立自治区的意见。否则，他认为汉族群众会起来游行示威、请愿反对政府。容县、桂林地区的汉族代表在会上驳斥了黄绍竑的谰言。代表们指出，黄绍竑所代表的“汉族群众”，只能是已经死亡的官僚地主阶级，而不是劳动的汉族人民。与会的代表们指出，根据历史记载，僮族在广西先于汉族。他们世代生存在同一地区，有自己的语言、文化和艺术，民族特征显著。为什么黄绍竑不愿看清这些事实呢？原来他认为：“你们这样做（指成立广西僮族自治区），李宗仁、白崇禧是否同意？”这就是他的真心实话。僮族代表农康等人警告黄绍竑：“现在是中华人民共和国，当家作主的是各族人民，而不是蒋介石和李、白集团统治下的中华民国。那个时代已经一去不复返了。”
    僮族右派分子黄现璠，曾多次利用全国人民代表大会代表身份，在桂西农村视察时散播了很多狭隘民族主义的言论，来挑拨僮、汉民族间的团结。黄现璠在大新、田阳、田东等县昧着良心对当地僮族群众说：“全国都解放了，只有僮族还未解放。六百万僮族的生命，掌握在几个汉族干部手里。”他还歪曲历史事实，说少数民族落后是汉族所造成的。他在田阳等县煽动僮族学生说：“你们念书不仅是要提高文化，还要为了政治翻身。”在宣传讨论建立广西僮族自治区期间，他在僮族群众中大肆煽动说：“他们（指汉族）不和我们合，我们就自己干。”在另一些场合，黄现璠竟明目张胆歪曲共产党的机关民族化政策，说“自治区建成后，就不要汉族干部”。并挑拨是非，打击少数民族老干部和共产党员干部。黄现璠除了疯狂破坏僮汉族的团结合作外，在视察中还恶意攻击了政府的粮食统购统销政策和农业合作化运动。张声震、覃辉等十多名僮族代表驳斥黄现璠说：桂西僮族自治州的少数民族干部占干部总数55％以上，全州的一百六十九个正副县（市）长中，民族干部占一百四十五人。广西省省长和桂西僮族自治州州长都是僮族。不知道黄现璠所说的“政治翻身”指的是什么？另一位僮族代表梁焕文指出：解放后僮族人民在汉族帮助下，桂西的经济文化有了很大的发展。到1956年，全州工业总产值比解放前增加了三十倍。粮食总产量比解放前最高年产量超过30％。由于僮文的创造和推广，僮族文化落后的旧面貌已经开始改观。黄现璠所指的“民族解放”不知是何居心？很多代表指出，黄现璠身为广西师范学院的历史教授，却把历史上统治少数民族的汉族统治阶级和汉族群众混为一谈，故意把阶级压迫说成是民族压迫，究竟要达到个什么目的？
    经过各族代表十六天来的揭露、批判和论战，黄现璠最后承认他的话都是谎言，是反动的反共反人民的言行；其目的在于在少数民族中骗取威信，以求得更高的政治地位。
    现在，黄现璠对他破坏民族团结的行为已经表示痛悔，并愿意向各族人民低头认罪。
