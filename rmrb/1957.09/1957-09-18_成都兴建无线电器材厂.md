Chengdu Building Radio Equipment Factory

(Reported by this newspaper) Chengdu is building a modern, comprehensive radio equipment manufacturing plant—the Southwest Radio Equipment Factory. Once completed, this factory, along with the newly built North China Radio Equipment Factory and the Beijing Electron Tube Factory, will open a new chapter in China's radio industry.

The Southwest Radio Equipment Factory is one of the basic enterprises of China's radio industry. All the technical data for this factory are provided by the Soviet Union. It integrates the advanced technology of the Soviet Union in manufacturing radio equipment and has many automated and semi-automated machines and equipment. To ensure product quality, the laboratories of some workshops have automatic air conditioning devices, so that the workshops maintain a certain temperature and humidity throughout the year. Workers must also wear rubber gloves and white hats during production. In addition to supplying the factory with major technological equipment and machinery, the Soviet government has also sent a group of experts to help with the construction and production of the factory.

The construction of this factory began in October 1954. At present, one of the main factory buildings is nearing completion, and another main factory building is under construction. Some machinery and equipment have also begun to be installed. It is expected that small-batch trial production of products will begin successively this winter and next spring.

　　成都兴建无线电器材厂
    本报讯　成都正在兴建一座现代化的综合性无线电器材制造工厂——西南无线电器材厂。这个厂建成以后，将同新建的华北无线电器材厂、北京电子管厂一起翻开我国无线电工业新的一页。
    西南无线电器材厂是我国无线电工业基础企业之一。这个厂的全部技术资料是苏联提供的。它综合了苏联制造无线电器材的先进工艺，拥有许多自动化和半自动化的机器设备。为了保证产品质量，部分车间的实验室有空气自动调剂装置，使车间常年保持一定的温度和湿度。工人也要带橡皮手套着白衣帽生产。苏联政府除供给这个厂以主要工艺设备和机器以外，还派来一批专家帮助建厂和生产。
    这个厂从1954年10月开始兴建。目前，主厂房中的一座已经接近竣工，另一座主厂房正在紧张施工，部分机器设备也已开始安装。预计在今冬明春即可陆续开始产品的确量试制。
