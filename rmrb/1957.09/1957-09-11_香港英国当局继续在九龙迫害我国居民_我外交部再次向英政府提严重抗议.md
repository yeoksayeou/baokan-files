Xinhua News Agency, 10th. Regarding the Hong Kong British authorities continuing to forcibly relocate Chinese residents and demolish their houses and fields in the Kowloon area, despite the protests of the Chinese government and the strong opposition of Chinese residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the British Office in China on the 10th, lodging another strong protest with the British government. This note also refuted the British government's defense in its reply of August 5 to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note of July 24, regarding the unreasonable measures taken by the Hong Kong British authorities.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note first pointed out: In its reply of August 5, the British government not only did not accept the solemn protest and reasonable demands of the Chinese government, but also maliciously slandered the Chinese government by distorting the facts, attempting to shirk the responsibility that the Hong Kong British authorities should bear for these measures that seriously damage the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese residents in Kowloon. At the same time, the Hong Kong British authorities, ignoring the protests and opposition of local Chinese residents, started a second round of forced demolitions in the Kowloon area on July 29, causing more Chinese residents to be ruined, lose their homes, and be displaced. The Chinese government feels indignant about this and once again lodges a strong protest.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note then refuted the British government's malicious slander against the Chinese government in its reply of August 5, which distorted the facts. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note pointed out: The Hong Kong British authorities' plan to demolish the area north of Kai Tak Airport has been strongly opposed and protested by local Chinese residents from the very beginning. Many local residents were forced to leave their homes only under the coercion of a large number of police officers. Many residents have not been properly resettled after being forced to leave their homes. Although the Hong Kong British authorities have provided some compensation to some residents, the compensation methods are extremely unreasonable, not only far from compensating for the serious losses suffered by the residents, but also according to the methods of the Hong Kong British authorities, many residents cannot get any compensation at all. However, in its reply, the British government described the Hong Kong British authorities' unreasonable measures that forced Chinese residents in Kowloon to be ruined, lose their homes, and be displaced as "an act purely out of humanitarianism," which was considered "just and reasonable" by local residents, and they "cooperated" with it. This is clearly a distortion of the facts and a reversal of right and wrong.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note continued: The British government's reply stated that the initial demolition plan of the Hong Kong authorities affected only "7,000 people," and that the areas north and east of Kai Tak Airport were not intended to be "extensively demolished." However, according to the statement issued to the Hong Kong press by the representatives of the ten villages in Kowloon, the number of residents affected by the initial demolition plan far exceeded 7,000. The Hong Kong British authorities' statements on April 6 and May 30 publicly admitted that the areas north and east of Kai Tak Airport would also be incorporated into the long-term development plan for the area in the future. The note pointed out that the British government's above-mentioned statement in its reply was obviously deliberately minimizing the demolition area and the number of affected residents, attempting to dilute the seriousness of the issue in order to reduce its responsibility.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note pointed out: The vast majority of residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon are Chinese, and the Chinese government has the responsibility and the right to demand that the Hong Kong British authorities respect and guarantee their traditional rights and peaceful lives. The British government's reply described the Chinese government's solemn protests and reasonable demands to the Hong Kong British authorities as "interfering in the internal affairs of another government." This is not only baseless, but can only be seen as an attempt to deny the Chinese government's right to exercise the protection of the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon from infringement, and is therefore contrary to general principles of international law.

The note finally reiterated: The British government and the Hong Kong British authorities must stop implementing the unreasonable measures of forcibly relocating Chinese residents and demolishing their houses and fields, and provide proper resettlement to the Chinese residents who have been forcibly relocated, and provide fair and reasonable compensation for their property losses. The traditional rights and normal lives of Chinese residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon must be respected, otherwise, the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities must bear the responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

According to the British government's reply of August 5, the unreasonable measures of forcibly demolishing the houses of Chinese residents in Kowloon were first described as being implemented as "part of a plan to resettle 300,000 people," and it was said that "there are no plans to demolish the area extensively" north and east of Kowloon City. About 7,000 people live in the area where forced demolitions are currently taking place.

The reply distorted and defended the fact that Chinese residents in the area north of Kai Tak Airport suffered the destruction of their homes, bankruptcy, and displacement due to the forced demolitions. The reply stated that the vast majority of people were "very satisfied" with the arrangements made by the Hong Kong British authorities, and that "the residents of the area have recognized that the work currently being carried out is reasonable and just, and are cooperating with the government."

Finally, the reply made unwarranted slanders against the protests and demands made in the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note to the British government on July 24, describing them as "interfering in the internal affairs of another government" and spreading "false and malicious rumors that are being spread in Hong Kong," and expressed "regret."

### 香港英国当局继续在九龙迫害我国居民  我外交部再次向英政府提严重抗议

　　香港英国当局继续在九龙迫害我国居民
　　我外交部再次向英政府提严重抗议
    新华社10日讯  我国外交部10日就香港英国当局不顾中国政府的抗议和港九中国居民的强烈反对，继续在九龙地区强迫中国居民迁移和拆毁他们的房屋、田园事件，照会英国代办处，再次向英国政府提出严重抗议。这个照会同时也驳斥了英国政府在8月5日对我外交部7月24日照会的复照中为香港英国当局的无理措施所进行的辩解。
    外交部照会首先指出：英国政府在8月5日的复照中不但没有接受中国政府的严正抗议和合理要求，而且不惜歪曲事实真象对中国政府进行了恶意诽谤，企图推诿香港英国当局对这一严重损害九龙中国居民正当权益的措施所应负的责任。同时，香港英国当局继续不顾当地中国居民的抗议和反对，从7月29日又开始在九龙地区进行了第二批强迫拆迁，使更多的中国居民陷于毁家破产和流离失所。中国政府对此感到愤慨，并且再一次提出严重的抗议。
    外交部照会继对英国政府8月5日复照中歪曲事实真象对中国政府所进行的恶意诽谤进行了驳斥。外交部照会指出：香港英国当局拆迁启德机场以北地区的计划，从一开始就遭到当地中国居民的强烈的反对和抗议。许多当地居民最后只是在大批警察的武力胁迫下才不得不离开他们的家园。许多居民被迫离开他们的家园后迄未得到妥善的安置。虽然香港英国当局对部分居民给予一些补偿，但是补偿办法极不合理，不但远不能补偿居民所受的严重损失，而且按照香港英国当局的办法，许多居民根本得不到任何补偿。但是，英国政府在复照中却把香港英国当局执行迫使九龙中国居民毁家破产、流离失所的无理措施，说成是“纯由人道主义出发的行动”，被当地居民认为是“公正与合理的”，而且得到了他们的“合作”。这显然是歪曲事实真相、颠倒黑白的说法。
    外交部照会继称：英国政府复照中说，香港当局初期的拆迁计划所影响的仅有“七千人”，启德机场以北和以东地区并不准备予以“广泛地拆除”。但是，根据九龙十乡代表向香港报界发表的声明，初期拆迁计划所影响的居民人数远远超过了七千人。香港英国当局4月6日和5月30日发表的声明中曾公开承认在启德机场以北和以东地区将来也要并入该地区的长期发展计划。照会指出：英国政府在复照中的上述说法，显然是故意缩小拆迁地区和受影响的居民人数，企图冲淡问题的严重性，以减轻它应负的责任。
    外交部照会指出：香港和九龙地区的绝大多数居民都是中国人，中国政府有责任和权利要求香港英国当局尊重和保障他们的传统权利和和平生活。英国政府复照中把中国政府对香港英国当局的严正抗议和合理要求说成是“干涉另一政府之内政”。这不但是毫无根据的，而且只能被看作是企图否定中国政府行使保障香港和九龙的中国居民的正当权益不受侵犯所应享的权利，因而是违背一般国际法原则的。
    照会最后重申：英国政府和香港英国当局必须停止执行强迫中国居民迁移和拆毁他们的房屋和田园的无理措施，并且对已被强迫迁移的中国居民给予妥善的安置，对他们的财产损失给予公平合理的赔偿。香港和九龙的中国居民的传统权利和正常生活必须受到尊重，否则，英国政府和香港英国当局必须承担由此产生的一切后果的责任。
    按英国政府8月5日复照中首先把这次强迫九龙中国居民拆迁的无理措施，说成是为了执行“三十万人的重行安置的计划的一部分”，并且说，对九龙城以北及以东的地带，“并不准备予以广泛地拆除”。目前进行强迫拆迁的地区内，约有七千人居住。
    复照对启德机场以北地区中国居民因被强迫拆迁而遭致毁家破产和流离失所的事实进行歪曲和辩解。复照说，极大多数人都对香港英国当局所作安排“甚感满意”，“该地区之居民已经承认了现所据以进行之工作是合理与公正的，并与政府合作。”
    复照最后对我国外交部7月24日给英国政府的照会中提出的抗议和要求作了无端的诽谤，说成是“干涉另一政府之内政”，和散播“在香港内所传布之谬误和恶意谣言”，表示“遗憾”。
