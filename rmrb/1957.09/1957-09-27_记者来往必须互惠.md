After a long period of effort by the American people and the American press, the U.S. State Department was finally forced to announce on August 22 that it would allow a group of American journalists to come to China for interviews. However, many developments regarding this issue over the past month have further confirmed that this is merely a deceptive tactic used by the U.S. State Department to cope with public opinion pressure.

While approving these American journalists to visit China, the U.S. State Department set up numerous obstacles in their path. Not only did the U.S. State Department designate topics for the American journalists to report on, requiring them to gather intelligence, but it also unjustifiably announced that it could not give Chinese journalists reciprocal treatment to visit the United States. In doing so, the U.S. State Department openly demonstrated its intention to use these American journalists to interfere in China's internal affairs, completely disregarding internationally recognized reciprocal practices and attempting to impose its will on China. Obviously, this typical imperialist attitude is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people. The U.S. State Department certainly understands this point. The reason it does this is because it still does not want American journalists to visit China, fearing that such visits would be detrimental to the U.S.'s continued policy of hostility toward China. It attempts to use this tactic to shift the responsibility for whether American journalists can visit China from itself to China.

However, the U.S. State Department did not achieve its goal. Its arrogant attitude of refusing to abide by the principle of equality and reciprocity has been condemned by American and world public opinion. Mrs. Roosevelt also believes that the Chinese people's insistence on the principle of reciprocity "is completely justified." The "New York Times" also had to rebuke Dulles in an editorial for refusing to grant reciprocal visas to Chinese journalists as "wrong." The U.S. State Department wanted to pass the buck on the issue of American journalists visiting China to China, but the result was that the blame still fell on itself, putting it in a very awkward position. However, the U.S. State Department stubbornly refuses to implement the principle of equality and reciprocity. To escape its predicament, the U.S. State Department announced that it would allow Chinese journalists to visit the United States, but not on a reciprocal basis, but only on the basis of considering individual applications.

The so-called consideration based on individual applications means that the United States will regard Chinese journalists visiting the United States as ordinary immigrants, rather than as envoys promoting understanding between the people of China and the United States. In this way, the United States actually refuses Chinese journalists' visits. Because according to U.S. immigration law, foreign immigrants entering the United States must not only undergo so-called "health and safety checks" upon entry, but also be fingerprinted. As everyone knows, fingerprinting is the most uncivilized method used for criminals. Using this barbaric method to insult guests visiting the United States is an important means for the U.S. State Department to obstruct cultural exchanges between the United States and other countries, because no one with self-respect is willing to endure this insult to his personality. Although the U.S. State Department says that the U.S. Congress has decided that the Secretary of State and the Attorney General can decide on certain exceptions where fingerprinting is not required, it has not affirmed that such exceptions apply to Chinese journalists visiting the United States. Therefore, the U.S. State Department's so-called consideration of the issue of Chinese journalists visiting the U.S. on the basis of individual applications is actually just a trick to deceive American public opinion and shirk its own responsibility.

Incidentally, the attitude and methods adopted by the Japanese government towards exchanges between the people and press circles of China and Japan are very similar to those of the United States. In recent years, more and more Japanese people have visited China. Our country warmly welcomes and receives these Japanese guests and provides them with various conveniences and as much assistance as possible. However, the Japanese government has adopted a completely opposite attitude. Although some people in the Japanese government also sing the praises of Sino-Japanese friendship, they adopt various methods, especially the insulting method of forced fingerprinting, to obstruct Chinese people from visiting Japan. As far as the press is concerned, since 1953, many Japanese journalists have visited China as groups or individuals. Some of them have resided in China for more than half a year. However, the Japanese government uses forced fingerprinting upon entry to obstruct Chinese journalists from visiting Japan and refuses to exchange journalists. Recently, two Xinhua News Agency reporters accompanied the Chinese delegation participating in the Third World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament to visit Japan. The Japanese government actually refused their request to extend their stay after the conference. Obviously, the Japanese government should change this attitude that violates the principle of equality and reciprocity, because it is extremely detrimental to friendly exchanges and mutual understanding between China and Japan.

The matter is already very clear: Whether American journalists can freely visit China and whether the press circles of China and the United States can conduct mutual visits depends entirely on whether the U.S. government is willing to abide by the principle of equality and reciprocity. The Chinese government has always strived to enhance mutual exchanges and understanding between China and the United States. In order to urge the United States to change its rigid attitude, the Chinese government put forward a proposal at the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks in Geneva on September 12, namely, to allow journalists from the other side to conduct news interviews in their respective countries on the basis of equality and reciprocity. If the U.S. government is indeed sincere in enabling American journalists to enter China for interviews, the Chinese government's proposal provides the U.S. government with an excellent opportunity to change its attitude and realize this sincerity. However, the U.S. representative rejected this proposal on the spot. This proves that the U.S. government has adopted a very irresponsible attitude towards the American people's desire to understand China. It is this attitude that makes the U.S. government's promise to allow American journalists to visit China a mere scrap of paper. Obviously, the American people and the press must make greater efforts to realize their desire to understand China.

### 记者来往必须互惠

    记者来往必须互惠
    经过美国人民和美国新闻界的长期努力以后，美国国务院终于被迫在8月22日宣布准许一批美国记者来中国进行采访。然而，一个多月来在这个问题上的许多情况，却使人更加肯定这不过是美国国务院用来应付舆论压力的一种欺骗手段。
    美国国务院在批准这些美国记者访问中国的同时，就在他们进行访问的道路上设下了重重障碍。美国国务院不但给美国记者指定了进行报道的题目，要他们收集情报，而且毫无道理地宣布不能给中国记者以访问美国的互惠待遇。美国国务院这样就表明公然要利用这批美国记者干涉中国的内政，并且完全无视国际公认的互惠惯例，企图把自己的意志强加在中国身上。很明显，这种典型的帝国主义的态度是中国人民所绝对不能接受的。美国国务院当然完全懂得这一点。它之所以这样做，是因为它仍然不希望美国记者访问中国，害怕这种访问会不利于美国继续保持敌视中国的政策。它企图利用这个手法，把美国记者能不能访问中国的责任从自己那里推到中国身上。
    但是，美国国务院并没有达到目的。它的拒绝遵守平等互惠原则的专横态度，受到了美国和世界舆论的谴责。罗斯福夫人也认为中国人民坚持互惠原则“是完全公正的”。“纽约时报”在一篇社论中也不得不责备杜勒斯拒绝给中国记者以互惠签证“是错误的”。美国国务院想把美国记者访华问题的球踢给中国，结果却还是落在自己头上，弄得十分尴尬。但是美国国务院仍然顽固地拒绝实行平等互惠的原则。为了给自己逃脱窘境，美国国务院宣布它将允许中国记者访问美国，但是不是在互惠的基础上，而只是在个别记者提出申请的基础上加以考虑。
    所谓在个别申请的基础上加以考虑，这就是说美国将把访问美国的中国记者看作是一般的移民，而不是作为促进中美两国人民之间的了解的使节。这样，美国实际上就拒绝了中国记者的访问。因为按照美国的移民法，进入美国的外国移民在入境时不但要受所谓“健康和安全的检查”，而且还必须按指印。大家知道，按指印是一种用于罪犯的最不文明的办法。用这种野蛮的办法来侮辱访问美国的客人，是美国国务院阻挠美国和其他国家之间的文化交流的一项重要的手段。因为没有一个有自尊心的人愿意忍受这种对于他的人格的侮辱。虽然美国国务院说，美国国会已经决议可由国务卿和司法部长决定某些可以不按指印的例外情况，但是它并没有肯定说这种例外情况适用于访问美国的中国记者。因此，美国国务院这种所谓在个别申请的基础上考虑中国记者访美问题的说法，实际上仍然不过是一种欺骗美国舆论、推卸自己责任的花招。
    顺便指出，日本政府对于中日两国人民和新闻界来往所抱的态度和所采用的手段，同美国十分相似。最近几年来，访问中国的日本方面的人士越来越多，我国热烈欢迎和接待了这些来访问的日本客人，并给予了各种方便和尽可能的帮助。可是日本政府却采取了完全相反的态度。日本政府的某些人士虽然也高唱中日友好，但是他们却采用各种办法特别是采用强迫按指印的侮辱性手段，来阻挠中国方面的人士访问日本。就新闻界的情况来说，从1953年以来，已经有不少日本记者以团体或者个人身份访问了中国。其中有的在中国居留了半年以上。可是日本政府却以入境时强迫按指印的手段来阻挠中国记者访问日本，并且拒绝交换记者。最近新华社两名记者随参加第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会的中国代表团访问日本，日本政府竟拒绝他们在会后延长旅日期限的要求。显然，日本政府应该改变这种违反平等互惠原则的态度，因为它极端不利于中日两国之间的友好往来和相互了解。
    事情已经十分清楚：美国记者能否自由地访问中国，中美两国新闻界能否互相进行访问，关键完全在于美国政府是否愿意遵守平等互惠的原则。中国政府一向为增进中美两国之间的互相来往和了解而努力。为了促使美国改变它的僵硬态度，中国政府在9月12日的日内瓦中美两国大使会谈中提出了一项建议，即在平等互惠的基础上准许对方新闻记者来各自的国家进行新闻采访。如果美国政府确有使美国记者进入中国从事采访的诚意的话，中国政府的这项建议就给美国政府提供了改变态度、实现这种诚意的极好的机会。可是美国代表当场就拒绝了这项建议。这就证明美国政府对于美国人民要求了解中国的愿望采取了极不负责的态度。正是这种态度，使得美国政府准许美国记者访问中国的诺言成了一纸具文。显然，美国人民和新闻界要想实现他们了解中国的愿望，还必须作更大的努力。
