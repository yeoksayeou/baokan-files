The library situation is excellent

The bourgeois rightists, without exception, slandered the library cause of New China, saying: "New China is a mess, and the library cause is also a mess." "The library cause is in crisis." But, in our opinion, it is very good, and there is no "crisis."

After liberation, the collections of many libraries have increased. For example, the Capital Library, which recently moved into the "Guozijian," currently has 1,110,491 volumes, nearly ten times the 113,977 volumes in 1949. The current Liaoning Provincial Library is the original Northeast Library. The collection has increased from 700,000 to 800,000 volumes in 1948 to more than 1.6 million volumes, second only to the Beijing Library. Before liberation, the only public library in Shanghai (i.e., the current Shanghai People's Library) had a total collection of about 90,000 Chinese books and 20,000 Western books. In the short few years after liberation, the collection has increased eightfold.

The number of public libraries is also increasing year by year. In 1954, there were more than 90 large public libraries nationwide, 1.9 times the highest year before liberation. This year, it has increased to 109. These libraries have a collection of more than 30 million books and periodicals.

The government's funding for libraries is also increasing. The annual funding for the Tianjin People's Library after liberation was about 30,000 yuan, which increased to 230,000 yuan in 1956. The Nanjing Library was expanded on the ruins of the puppet Central Library, and now has an annual funding of about 240,000 yuan. In the first half of 1948, the Shanghai Library's entire office expenses and operating expenses were only enough to cover the monthly water and electricity expenses.

In order to make full use of their collections, libraries in various regions have extensively carried out interlibrary loan work. In June of this year, the State Council's Science Planning Commission decided to establish a national central library and compile a national union catalog of books. In 1956, the Shanghai Library established borrowing relationships with more than 740 units in the city, lending more than 18,000 books. Library staff often take newly compiled catalogs and visit readers in government agencies, enterprises, and scientific research departments. The Beijing Library has also established exchange relationships with 636 units in 59 countries, enabling experts and scholars to see important books that are not available in China.

Libraries in various regions are making every effort to collect scattered books. For example, the Fujian Provincial Library collected more than 20,000 scattered books in various parts of the province last year, supplementing the local chronicles of all 66 counties and cities in the province, and obtaining many rare and fine books.

The management of libraries in our country is also constantly improving. Particular attention should be paid to the reform of book classification methods. New library classification methods are gradually replacing the rigid decimal classification method. There have also been significant reforms in cataloging work. New classification methods for small and medium-sized libraries have been compiled and recently published.

In addition to the library science departments of Peking University and Wuhan University, which train library professionals, the Social and Cultural Undertakings Administration of the Ministry of Culture and the Nanjing Library jointly organized a training course for library staff from provinces and cities across the country in March of this year. The library science department of Peking University has enrolled more than 200 in-service cadres as correspondence students in the past two years. The Academy of Sciences, universities, public libraries, and other systems have held many short-term training courses for library cadres, training a large number of professional cadres.

At the end of December last year, the first library science academic paper discussion meeting was held at the Nanjing Library. More than a dozen papers were read at the meeting. This plays a great role in promoting academic research in library science and improving work.

In recent years, general "Library Work," academic "Library Science Communications," "Library Science Translation Series" introducing advanced Soviet experience, and "National Index to Major Newspapers and Periodicals" for reference materials have been published.

Our library cause, like other socialist construction undertakings, is developing rapidly, and the rightists' slander is in vain. (Domestic Data Group of this newspaper)

### 图书馆的情况好得很

    图书馆的情况好得很
    对新中国的图书事业，资产阶级右派分子也毫不例外地诬蔑一番，说：“新中国一团糟，图书馆事业也是一团糟。”“图书馆事业存在着危机”。但，在我们看来，却是好得很，并没有什么“危机”。
    解放后，很多图书馆的藏书增加了。例如，不久以前迁入“国子监”的首都图书馆，目前拥有藏书一百十一万零四千九百一十册，为1949年藏书十一万三千九百七十七册的近十倍。现在的辽宁省图书馆是原来的东北图书馆，藏书从1948年的七、八十万册，目前增加到一百六十多万册，仅次于北京图书馆。解放前，上海唯一的公共图书馆（即现在的上海人民图书馆）全部藏书中文书约有九万册，西文书有两万册，解放后的短短几年里，藏书增加了八倍。
    公共图书馆数目也在与年俱增。1954年全国大型公共图书馆有九十多个，为解放前最高年的一点九倍。今年，增加至一百零九个。这些图书馆收藏书刊三千多万册。
    政府给图书馆经费的拨款，也在增加。天津市人民图书馆解放后每年的经费约三万元，1956年增加到二十三万元。南京图书馆是在伪中央图书馆的烂摊子上扩大起来的，现在每年经费约二十四万元。而1948年上半年，上海图书馆的全部办公费和事业费仅够应付每月的水电开支。
    各地图书馆为使藏书得到充分的利用，广泛开展了馆际互借工作。今年6月间，国务院科学规划委员会又决定建立全国性的中心图书馆，编制全国图书联合目录。上海图书馆在1956年一年里，与该市七百四十多个单位建立了外借关系，外借书籍达一万八千余册。图书馆工作人员经常带着新编的书目，深入机关、企业及科学研究部门拜访读者。北京图书馆还与五十九个国家的六百三十六个单位建立了交换关系，使专家、学者能看到国内没有的重要书籍。
    各地图书馆都在尽力收集散存书籍。如福建省图书馆去年在该省各地收集了散存书籍两万多册，把全省六十六个县市地方志补充齐全，并得到了许多珍本、善本书籍。
    我国图书馆的管理工作也在不断改进着。特别值得注意的是图书分类法的改革，新的图书馆分类法逐渐代替了僵死的十进分类法。在编目工作上也有显著的改革。新的中、小型图书馆分类法已经编成，在最近已公布。
    培养图书馆专业人材的单位，除了北京大学和武汉大学的图书馆学系外，今年3月间，中央文化部社会文化事业管理局、南京图书馆等单位联合举办了全国省市图书馆工作人员进修班。北京大学图书馆学系专修科两年来招收了二百多名在职干部为函授生。科学院、高等学校、公共图书馆等系统都举办过多次的图书馆干部短期训练班，培养了大批专业干部。
    去年12月底在南京图书馆还举行了第一届图书馆学科学论文讨论会。会上宣读了十多篇论文。这对于推动图书馆学学术研究，改进工作有极大的作用。
    几年来，出版了一般性的“图书馆工作”，学术性的“图书馆学通讯”，介绍苏联先进经验的“图书馆学翻译丛刊”，资料索引有“全国主要报刊资料索引”等等。
    我们的图书馆事业也跟其他社会主义建设事业一样，在日新月异地发展着，右派分子的诬蔑是徒然的。　（本报国内资料组）
