　　The work of fire protection is an important measure to safeguard our country's socialist construction and the safety of the people's lives and property. In the past few years, under the leadership of people's committees at all levels, the principle of "prevention first, fire fighting as a supplement" has been implemented, mass fire prevention work has been initially carried out, old fire protection organizations have been rectified, and the fire fighting capabilities of fire police teams have been improved. In some cities with a better foundation in fire protection work, the struggle against fire has been organized more effectively, and the number of fires and losses has been reduced, achieving certain results. On the other hand, due to the development of the country's socialist construction, the continuous growth and concentration of material wealth, and the gradual increase in fire sources and hazards, the task of fire protection work has become increasingly heavy. Under these circumstances, some regions and departments have not paid due attention to the fight against fire, and they lag behind the needs of objective reality in mobilizing and organizing the masses for fire prevention, and in the organization, professional construction, and scientific and technological level of fire protection. Therefore, the current fire situation is still serious. Fires continue to occur in cities, towns, industrial and mining enterprises, and rural areas. For example, the Mentai Zi Cigarette Factory in Bengbu City, Anhui Province, suffered a major fire on April 4 this year due to the fact that the buildings did not meet fire protection requirements. Almost the entire factory was destroyed, with losses amounting to more than 400,000 yuan; the Xinli Triacid Regeneration Factory in Shenyang City suffered a fire on July 8 due to improper storage of chemical raw materials, burning more than 20,000 kilograms of nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, etc., causing the entire factory to stop production; a new reading room with an area of 5,400 square meters in Tianjin City was about to be completed in mid-September this year, but due to carelessness, a major fire suddenly broke out on September 3. A year of hard work was mostly turned to ashes in three hours; on January 9, a fire also occurred in Gaowu Village, Sanjiang County, Guangxi Province, burning down 197 houses, more than 50,000 kilograms of grain, and 930 farm implements, and burning to death two people and 17 oxen. Among all the fires that occurred, some could have been avoided, but often they were not avoided due to lax prevention and control, and loose systems, which brought huge losses to national wealth and the people's lives and property.

    In order to further strengthen fire protection work, effectively prevent the occurrence of fires, and safeguard socialist construction and the safety of the people's lives and property, the following instructions are hereby issued:

    First, people's committees at all levels and relevant departments must earnestly strengthen their leadership over fire protection work, criticize and correct the erroneous ideas of turning a blind eye to the serious fire situation and not caring about fire protection work, and should plan urban fire protection facilities accordingly based on the development of urban and industrial construction. The competent departments of the national economy must strengthen the fire protection work of their subordinate units. In organizing the fight against fire, continue to implement the principle of "prevention first, fire fighting as a supplement." In cities, the focus is on protecting factories, enterprises, and basic construction sites; in rural areas, the focus is on protecting grassroots financial and trade units, cotton and grain warehouses, and agricultural production cooperatives, strengthening regular fire protection work. In implementing fire protection measures, fire safety should be closely integrated with the development of production. It is necessary to ensure as much as possible to avoid the harm of fire, and also pay attention to economic rationality, prevent excessive and unrealistic demands, and avoid waste.

    Second, rely on and organize the masses for self-defense, and guide the broad masses to consciously and actively participate in fire protection work. To this end, it is necessary to widely and deeply carry out mass fire prevention propaganda and education work to raise the fire prevention awareness of the broad masses and popularize fire protection knowledge. People's committees at all levels should carry out this work in a planned manner based on the characteristics of local fire occurrences. The propaganda department should include fire protection as a regular propaganda content. On the basis of propaganda and education and mobilizing the masses, volunteer fire fighting organizations should be gradually established in urban streets, enterprises, county towns, market towns, cotton and grain warehouses, state-owned farms, and large agricultural production cooperatives, as needed, and some necessary fire extinguishing tools should be set up in order to carry out regular fire prevention and necessary fire extinguishing work.

    Third, strengthen the organizational construction of fire protection work. Public security organs at all levels should establish and improve fire supervision institutions and allocate a certain number of engineering and technical personnel. Cities that need to establish public security fire brigades but have not yet established them (especially emerging industrial cities) should establish them accordingly with the development of urban construction. Cities with insufficient fire police force should be appropriately replenished according to actual needs. Implement a two-shift duty system. If the staffing is insufficient, if it still cannot be solved after taking internal adjustments or reducing duty vehicles, the local people's committee can adjust and solve it within the city's staffing. At the same time, training and education of fire brigades should be strengthened to continuously improve fire fighting capabilities. In order to gradually improve the technical equipment of fire protection, in addition to strengthening the inspection, maintenance, and regional adjustment and use of existing fire protection equipment, the State Planning Commission and the State Economic Commission should comprehensively plan the production and supply of fire trucks, equipment, and chemical extinguishing agents. The funds required for fire protection should be included in the local budget expenditures by people's committees at all levels.

  The full-time fire protection organizations of enterprises should be adjusted once. Where several enterprises are located in one place and are close to each other, in addition to retaining a small number of full-time fire prevention personnel in each enterprise unit, the existing full-time fire brigades of the enterprises, together with the technical equipment, should be transferred to the public security organs, which will be uniformly led and uniformly set up fire stations. The required funds will still be shared proportionally by the enterprises. The principle for establishing fire protection organizations in enterprise units in the future should be: large-scale enterprise units with more fire hazards should establish full-time fire brigades separately, and the public security organs should provide guidance in terms of business; some enterprise units, according to their scale, fire hazards, and other circumstances, should establish full-time fire brigades, but because they are close to other enterprises, in order to save expenses, the municipal people's committee can uniformly set up fire brigades (stations) according to the distribution of industrial areas; general enterprise units should be equipped with a certain number of full-time fire prevention personnel as needed, and organize volunteer fire brigades led by these full-time fire prevention personnel.

    Fourth, the relevant industrial and financial departments of the Central Government should formulate corresponding fire prevention measures or fire prevention technical specifications according to the different characteristics of their subordinate units. All localities and units should also formulate some specific fire prevention systems according to local conditions, so that the people can follow them. Implement a fire prevention responsibility system in factories and enterprises to ensure the implementation of various fire protection measures.

    Fifth, public security organs at all levels must further strengthen fire supervision work, promote safety measures for fire prevention in various departments of the national economy in a step-by-step manner, supervise the implementation of various fire protection rules, methods, and technical specifications, and organize regular fire prevention inspection work in conjunction with relevant departments and relying on the broad masses. Those who violate fire protection rules, methods, and technical specifications and cause fire losses shall be given administrative penalties or held criminally liable according to the seriousness of the circumstances.

    In addition, in order to continuously improve the scientific and technological level of our country's fire protection, we should train fire protection technical cadres in a planned manner and gradually carry out fire protection scientific and technological research to meet the needs of fighting fires.

　　国务院关于加强消防工作的指示
    消防工作是保卫我国社会主义建设和人民生命财产安全的一项重要措施。几年以来，在各级人民委员会的领导下，实行了“以防为主、以消为辅”的方针，初步开展了群众性的防火工作，整顿了旧有的消防组织，提高了消防民警队伍的灭火战斗能力。在部分消防工作基础较好的城市，较有成效地组织了同火灾的斗争，火灾的发生次数和损失已见减少，取得了一定的成绩。但在另一方面，由于国家社会主义建设的发展，物资财富的不断增长和集中，火源火险的逐渐增多，消防工作的任务也就随之日趋繁重。在这种情况下，由于有些地区和部门对于同火灾的斗争还没有引起应有的重视，在发动和组织群众防火方面，在消防的组织、业务建设和科学技术水平上，都还落后于客观实际的需要。因而，当前火灾情况还是严重的，不论在城市、集镇、工矿、企业和农村，火灾都还不断地发生。例如安徽省蚌埠市门台子烟厂，因建筑物不符合防火要求，于今年4月4日发生大火，几乎全厂被毁，损失达四十余万元；沈阳市新力三酸再生厂，因对化学原料贮藏不当，于7月8日发生火灾，烧毁硝酸、盐酸等二万余公斤，使全厂生产停顿；天津市新建的一个有五千四百平方公尺的阅览馆，眼看在今年9月中旬就要竣工了，但是由于麻痹大意，突于9月3日发生大火，一年来辛勤的劳动，在三小时内就大部分化为灰烬；1月9日广西省三江县高武屯也发生一次大火，烧毁房屋一百九十七间，粮食五万多斤，农具九百三十件，并烧死二人、耕牛十七头。在所有发生的火灾当中，本来有些是可以避免的，但往往由于防范不严、制度松懈等原因，就没有能够避免，从而给国家财富和人民生命财产带来了巨大的损失。
    为了进一步加强消防工作，有效地制止火灾的发生，保卫社会主义建设和人民生命财产的安全，特作如下指示：
    第一、各级人民委员会和各有关部门必须切实加强对消防工作的领导，批判和纠正对火灾的严重情况熟视无睹和不关心消防工作的错误思想，并且应当根据城市、工业建设的发展，将城市消防设施相应地加以规划。国民经济各主管部门必须加强所属单位的消防工作。在组织同火灾的斗争中，继续贯彻“以防为主、以消为辅”的方针。在城市以保卫工厂、企业、基本建设工地，在农村以保卫基层财贸单位、棉粮仓库、农业生产合作社为重点，加强消防的经常工作。在贯彻消防措施中，应当使消防安全与发展生产密切结合起来。既要尽量保证免受火灾的危害，又要注意经济合理，防止要求过高，不切实际，造成浪费的现象。
    第二、依靠和组织群众自防，引导广大群众自觉地积极地参加消防工作。为此，必须广泛深入地开展群众性的防火宣传教育工作，提高广大群众的防火警惕性，普及消防知识。各级人民委员会应当根据当地火灾发生的特点，有计划地进行这一工作。宣传部门应将消防作为经常的宣传内容之一。在宣传教育和发动群众的基础上，应该根据需要，在城市的街道、企业单位、县城、集镇、棉粮仓库、国营农场和大型农业生产合作社，逐渐建立起义务消防组织，设置一些必需的灭火工具，以便进行经常的防火和必要时的灭火工作。
    第三、加强消防工作的组织建设。各级公安机关应当将消防监督机构建立与健全起来，并且调配一定数量的工程技术人员。凡是需要建立而现在还没有建立公安消防队的城市（尤其是新兴的工业城市），应当随着城市建设的发展相应地建立起来。消防警力不足的城市，应当根据实际需要适当加以充实。实行二班制的值勤制度，如果编制不足，在采取内部调整或者减少值勤车辆的办法后，仍然不能解决，可以由当地人民委员会在全市编制内调整解决。同时，应当加强消防队的训练和教育，以不断提高灭火战斗能力。为了逐步改善消防的技术装备，除加强对现有消防器材的检修保养和地区之间适当地加以调剂使用外，国家计划委员会、国家经济委员会应当将消防车辆、器材、化学灭火剂的生产和供应，全面地加以规划。消防事业所需的经费应当由各级人民委员会列入地方预算开支。
  企业专职消防组织，应当进行一次调整。凡是几个企业位于一处，相距较近的，各企业单位除保留少数专职防火人员外，应当将现有企业专职消防队连同技术装备转交公安机关，由公安机关统一领导和统一设置消防站，所需经费仍由各该企业按比例分担。今后在企业单位建立消防组织的原则应当是：规模较大、火灾危险性较多的企业单位，应当单独建立专职消防队，公安机关在业务上给予指导；有些企业单位根据其规模、火灾危险性等情况，虽然应当建立专职消防队，但是由于和其它企业相距较近，为节约经费开支，可以由市人民委员会根据工业区域的分布情况统一设置消防队（站）；一般企业单位，应当视实际需要配备一定的专职防火人员，并且组织这些专职消防人员所领导的义务消防队。
    第四、中央各有关工业、财经部门应当根据所属单位不同的特点，分别制定相应的防火办法或防火技术规范。各地方和各单位也应当因地制宜规定一些具体的防火制度，使人民群众有所遵循。在工厂、企业中实行防火责任制度，以保证各项消防措施的贯彻执行。
    第五、各级公安机关必须进一步加强消防监督工作，在国民经济各部门有步骤地推行预防火灾的安全措施，监督各种防火规则、办法的贯彻执行，结合有关部门，依靠广大群众组织经常的防火检查工作。对于违犯消防规则、办法和技术规范而造成火灾损失的责任者，应当根据情节轻重，给以治安管理处罚或者依法追究刑事责任。
    此外，为了不断地提高我国消防事业的科学技术水平，应当有计划地培养消防技术干部，逐步开展消防科学技术研究工作，以适应同火灾作斗争的需要。
