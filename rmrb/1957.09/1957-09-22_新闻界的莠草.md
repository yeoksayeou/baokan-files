    Striving to Turn "Chili Pepper" into a Tool for Opposing the Party: Shu Xue'en Fantasizes About Disrupting the People's World

    During the anti-Rightist struggle, the China Youth Daily exposed the anti-Party words and deeds of Shu Xue'en, a Rightist element within the Party.

    Shu Xue'en was a reporter for the China Youth Daily and the former head of the "Chili Pepper" supplement group. During his tenure as the head of the supplement group, Shu Xue'en did his utmost to turn "Chili Pepper" into a tool for carrying out his anti-Party activities. He even bluntly stated that he wanted to make "Chili Pepper" anti-Party, saying that "'Chili Pepper' is a rebellious work," and that "every issue must make a revolution." Shu Xue'en tried his best to place "Chili Pepper" above the Party, single-mindedly trying to get rid of and negate the Party's leadership over criticism. He also tried hard to change the name of "Chili Pepper" to "Sun Wukong," even wanting to use the spirit of Sun Wukong's havoc in the Heavenly Palace to disrupt today's people's world.

    Shu Xue'en came from a landlord and capitalist family and is an opportunist and careerist who infiltrated the Communist Party. He said, "Politics is difficult to cultivate well, I just need to have artistic ambition."

    Conspiring to Seize Leadership of the Radio Station: Li Tianmin Becomes a Traitor to the Party

    The Jiangsu Province Journalism Workers Symposium exposed the anti-Party words and deeds of Li Tianmin, a Rightist element within the Party.

    Li Tianmin was a reporter for the Jiangsu Provincial People's Broadcasting Station. He proposed that the guiding principle for running the radio station should be "fewer political programs, less coordination with central tasks," in order to篡改 (cuan gai, usurp) the political direction of the broadcasting station and seize leadership of the People's Broadcasting Station. In reality, he has already become a traitor to the Party. He vigorously advocated running dancing programs, introducing "how to invite female dance partners," "where to look when dancing," "how to smile," and so on. He also put forward the proposal of a "popularly elected" editorial board, attempting to drive out the Party's leaders and seize the People's Broadcasting Station.

    Shouting to Open Fire on the People's Regime: Wang Zhanxian is a Mad Anti-Communist Fellow

    The Anti-Rightist Struggle Symposium for Shanghai Journalism Workers exposed the reactionary words and deeds of Wang Zhanxian, a reporter for Xinmin Evening News.

    Wang Zhanxian is a mad anti-Communist and anti-socialist Rightist element. He clamored that there is no freedom now, and demanded the realization of so-called "four major freedoms." He advocated abolishing the leadership of the Communist Party, letting the Communist Party dissolve into the masses, and not occupying a leading position. He said, "The Communist Party is more cruel than Qin Shi Huang." He believes that under today's people's regime, it is impossible to realize the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and to truly contend, it should involve the issue of political power.

    舒学煾出身于地主兼资本家家庭，是一个混进共产党内的投机分子和野心家。他说：“政治是难修养好的，我只要有艺术野心就行了。”

    李天民是江苏省人民广播电台的记者。他提出办电台的方针是“少办政治性节目，少配合中心工作”，借以篡改广播电台的政治方向，夺取人民广播电台的领导权。实际上，他已成为党的叛徒。他极力主张办跳舞节目，介绍“如何请女舞伴”、“跳舞的时候眼睛朝什么地方看”、“怎样微笑”等等。他还提出“民选”编委会的主张，企图赶掉党的领导人，将人民广播电台夺取过去。
