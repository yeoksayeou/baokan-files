Xinhua News Agency, 19th—Chairman Mao Zedong said at the banquet he hosted tonight for Vice President Radhakrishnan that the unity of the one billion people of China and India is a great force and an important guarantee of peace in Asia and the world.

　　Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai attended the banquet tonight.

　　Chairman Mao Zedong also said in his speech that one of the characteristics of our time is the rise of national independence movements in Asian and African countries. Colonialists are trying every means to reverse this situation. However, as the Egyptian people last year and the Syrian people now have shown to the world, all the conspiracies and provocations of the colonialists will surely meet with the most disastrous failure. The Chinese people resolutely support the struggle of the people of Asian and African countries to win and safeguard national independence.

　　Chairman Mao Zedong also thanked Vice President Radhakrishnan for bringing the profound friendship of the great Indian people to the Chinese people.

　　Vice President Radhakrishnan also spoke at the banquet. He said that the new force inspiring the people of Asian and African countries is the force of striving for freedom, the will to strive for freedom. This is a common characteristic of the people of all dependent countries today. He said that India is cooperating with all countries so that the people of dependent countries can liberate themselves and help those nations achieve social progress in their own economies. In this regard, India and China stand together.

　　Vice President Radhakrishnan reiterated that India hopes that China will join the United Nations, because without the representatives of the great Chinese people, the United Nations organization itself is flawed.

　　Also attending the banquet tonight were Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Li Weihan, Vice Premiers Peng Dehuai, He Long, Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, President of the Supreme People's Court Dong Biwu, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the CPPCC Chen Shutong, Bao Erhan, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, and heads of various government departments, democratic parties, and people's organizations.

　　Vice President Radhakrishnan's entourage, the Indian Ambassador to China, and the envoys of various countries to China also attended the banquet.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 19th—Premier Zhou Enlai held a grand reception with more than 500 people tonight to welcome the Vice President of the Republic of India, Radhakrishnan, and his entourage.

　　At the reception, Premier Zhou raised his glass in a toast. He proposed that everyone toast to the great friendship between China and India, to the unity of Asian and African countries, to the friendship of the people of all countries in the world, to world peace, and to the health of Vice President Radhakrishnan, the great friend of the Chinese people. The Indian Vice President also raised his glass to congratulate the friendship between India and China, the happiness and prosperity of the Chinese people, and world peace.

　　Accompanied by Premier Zhou, Vice President Radhakrishnan met with prominent figures from all walks of life in China. They constantly greeted each other with folded hands and talked cordially. The entire reception was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere.
