Look! Liu Jiemei's Past and Present

    A moving exhibition was recently held in the Cultural Center of Huanggang County, Hubei Province. The exhibition used comparisons of living objects from the past and present to showcase the situation of Liu Jiemei (Communist Party member), the head of the Agricultural Technology Guidance Station in Macaomiao Township of the county. (See page 5 of this newspaper on September 17 for details.)

    These silent objects vividly illustrate the earth-shaking changes experienced by a peasant family, evoking memories in many! This exhibition educated Liu Jiemei himself, who was deeply poisoned by capitalist ideology and had once lost his way and forgotten his roots, as well as the broad masses.

    The pictures of objects used by Liu Jiemei's family for generations, which were exhibited at the meeting, were published in the Hubei Daily on September 22. This newspaper has selected the following for publication.

    This is Liu Jiemei today.

    After liberation, Liu Jiemei was given a carved wooden bed, and also bought new mosquito nets and new quilts.

    This is the wooden bed Liu Jiemei used to sleep on, the mosquito net on the bed had been used for eighty years.

    This is Liu Jiemei's image before liberation.

    These are the clothes Liu Jiemei wore when he was a hired laborer.

    The bowl and gourd that Liu Jiemei used when begging for food before liberation.

    After liberation, Liu Jiemei's family added more than ninety new pieces of clothing.

    This is the cotton-padded jacket Liu Jiemei's eldest child used to wear and the new cotton-padded jacket he wears now.

    At the exhibition, Liu Jiemei, with a heavy heart, told the masses about his past experiences.
