As a Cadre of the People's Court, Yuan Jian Advocated Bourgeois Legal System and Opposed the People's Democratic Dictatorship

　　This newspaper reports that the anti-rightist struggle at the Supreme People's Court is developing in depth, and recently exposed Yuan Jian, a rightist element within the Party who is a researcher at the Research Office of the Court and has 18 years of Party membership.

　　After the anti-rightist struggle began, Yuan Jian frantically slandered the anti-rightist struggle as making a mountain out of a molehill. He wanted the Party to "sleep for three months" and then "wake up to clean up the mess," vainly attempting to disarm the Party and allow rightist elements to attack the Party even more rampantly.

　　At the beginning of the rectification campaign, Yuan Jian actively cooperated with rightist elements in society to launch a rampant attack on the Party. He maliciously slandered that "some people use the excuse that achievements are the main thing and shortcomings are individual cases as a shield." When the rightist element Xu Mengxiong slandered that "Renmin University is a big beehive of dogmatism," Yuan Jian also shouted wildly, "The students trained by Renmin University can't collect honey, they only know how to sting people," and further used the lie that "the quality of university students is not high, which is the result of laymen leading experts," to echo the reactionary remarks of "laymen cannot lead experts," opposing the Party's leadership over education and scientific research.

　　Yuan Jian also had a set of extremely reactionary political and legal views. Although he worked in the People's Court, he was very hostile to the people's democratic dictatorship system. He advocated that "the more democracy, the better, and the less dictatorship, the better." He opposed the thorough elimination of counter-revolutionaries, denied that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement had any achievements, and slandered the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement as "making everyone feel like the enemy." He cursed that our "law does not speak of conscience," and even openly proposed that the People's Court implement bourgeois "independent trial" and abolish the Party's leadership over judicial work. He also advocated using bourgeois principles of "democracy" and "freedom" to change our country's personnel system. He wanted to create a "free market" in the appointment and deployment of cadres, advocating that "if the work suits you, stay; if it doesn't suit you, leave."

　　Recently, all the staff of the Supreme People's Court held continuous meetings to launch a struggle of reasoning against this rightist element within the Party. After his absurd arguments were refuted one by one by his comrades, he had to start bowing his head to admit his guilt, expressing that he would conduct a profound self-criticism.

　　身为人民法院干部　提倡资产阶级法制
　　袁健反对人民民主专政
    本报讯　最高人民法院反右派斗争正在深入发展，最近又揭发出该院研究室研究员、有十八年党龄的党内右派分子袁健。
    袁健在反右派斗争开始以后，还疯狂地诬蔑反右派斗争是小题大作，他要党“睡三个月大觉”，再“起来收拾残局”，妄图用这种办法来解除党的武装，让右派分子更加猖狂地向党进攻。
    袁健在整风一开始，就积极配合社会上的右派分子向党发动了猖狂进攻，他恶意地诬蔑说“有些人就是以成绩是主要的，缺点是个别的作挡箭牌”；右派分子许孟雄诬蔑“人民大学是教条主义的大蜂窝”，袁健也跟着狂叫“人民大学培养的学生，不会采蜜，光会螫人”，并进而用“大学生质量不高，就是外行领导内行的结果”的谎言，来与“外行不能领导内行”的反动言论相呼应，反对党对教育和科学研究工作的领导。
    袁健还有一套极其反动的政治观点和法律观点。他虽然在人民法院工作，却非常仇视人民民主专政制度。他主张“民主越多越好，专政越少越好”，他反对彻底肃清反革命，他否定肃反运动有成绩，诬蔑肃反运动是“弄得草木皆兵”。他诅咒我们的“法律是不讲良心的”，甚至公然提出要人民法院实行资产阶级的“独立审判”，取消党对司法工作的领导。他还主张用资产阶级“民主”“自由”原则，改变我们国家的人事制度，他要在干部的任用调配上搞“自由市场”，主张“工作合则留，不合则去”。
    最近最高人民法院全体工作人员连续召开会议，对这个党内右派分子展开了说理斗争，当他的荒谬论点被同志们一一驳倒之后，他不得不开始低头认罪，表示要进行深刻检讨。
