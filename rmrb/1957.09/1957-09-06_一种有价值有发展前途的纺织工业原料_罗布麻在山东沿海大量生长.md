A Valuable and Promising Textile Raw Material
Apocynum Found Growing Abundantly Along the Shandong Coast

Jinan Dispatch: Large quantities of Apocynum (commonly known as wild hemp or tea sapling), a valuable and promising industrial raw material, have recently been discovered growing in the barren alkaline areas of coastal regions such as Lijin, Guangrao, and Zhanhua in Shandong Province. According to estimates made at a symposium held by the Provincial Department of Agriculture on September 2nd, dense growths of Apocynum cover as much as 15,000 mu in the wastelands of Lijin County. In Guangrao, Wudi, Zhanhua and other counties, there are approximately 40,000 mu where Apocynum grows relatively densely, with a fiber extraction rate of generally over 17%. In addition, there are approximately one million mu or more where the density is sparser.

The advantages of Apocynum are: good quality, strong tensile strength, drought resistance, alkali resistance, and it does not occupy arable land; the yield is also very high. At the same time, it has a very wide range of uses. After processing, it can be woven into fine and strong flannelette and cloth. It can also be used by the fishing industry for weaving nets, ropes, etc. In the past, this hemp was often cut down for firewood; in the future, it will be used as an industrial raw material, which will greatly increase the income of local farmers.

    一种有价值有发展前途的纺织工业原料
    罗布麻在山东沿海大量生长
    本报济南5日电　山东利津、广饶、沾化等沿海地区的荒碱地带上，最近发现生长着大量的罗布麻（俗名野麻、茶棵子）。这是一种相当有价值并有很大发展前途的工业原料。据9月2日在省农业厅的一个座谈会上的估计，在利津县的荒地中，长着稠密的罗布麻达一万五千亩。广饶、无棣、沾化等县，罗布麻生长较稠密的有四万亩左右，出麻率一般在17％以上，另外，密度较稀的还有约百万亩以上。
    罗布麻的优点是：品质好、拉力强、耐旱、耐碱，又不占耕地面积，产量也很高；同时用途十分广，经过加工可织出细致结实的各种绒和布，也可供渔业织网、织绳等用。过去这种麻多被砍掉作烧柴；今后，将被作为工业原料加以利用，并可给当地农民增加很大收入。
