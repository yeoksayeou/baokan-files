    Impartially Try the American Murderer!
    ——Notes on Attending the Girard Trial——
    Lan Hai
    A little over two hours by train from Tokyo brings one to Maebashi, the central city of Gunma Prefecture, known for "Mount Akagi" and silkworm raising. The trial of the "Girard Case," which once caused a sensation in public opinion in both Japan and the United States and became the focus of world attention, held its first public hearing here on August 26. This trial will continue until the end of October before it can conclude and a verdict be announced.
    On the day of the first public hearing, hundreds of workers, farmers, and citizens flocked to the front of the Maebashi District Court, holding up banners with slogans such as: "Impartially try the American murderer!" "Don't make a ruling to please the Americans!" "Turn Girard over to Japanese custody!" and many other slogans. These slogans clearly expressed the Japanese people's demands for the trial. However, the first public hearing already showed signs of betraying this just demand of the Japanese people.
    Under the guise of the fine words of an "international trial," a strong American color was evident both inside and outside the courtroom. Ordinary Japanese spectators were limited to only thirty-five admissions, and the more than five hundred people who requested to attend the hearing (some of whom had been queuing up the night before) had to participate in a lottery. However, in the courtroom, Americans in military uniform or plain clothes occupied special seats. According to the Japan-U.S. Administrative Agreement, in addition to two U.S. government representatives as assessors, representatives from the U.S. Army command, the U.S. Ambassador, the chief counsel of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, the U.S. Forces Japan command, the American Legion, etc., sat side by side on the court, arrogantly intimidating the "Japanese country judges." The number of domestic and foreign reporters was limited to forty-two, of which more than ten were reporters from various U.S. news agencies and newspapers.
    The exterior of the court was similarly assisted by the U.S. Army Japan. Hotels and shops around the courthouse were rented by more than a dozen foreign news organizations, which set up temporary branches there, most of them American. The U.S. Army Japan Intelligence Department, stationed in Kanagawa Prefecture, dispatched six staff members, including Major Rapp, to set up a liaison office in the Gunma Prefecture government office opposite the courthouse, and also set up a press room in the U.S. military barracks in Oizumi-cho, where Girard was being held, providing meticulous hospitality to the American press corps. In addition, six U.S. military helicopters waited in the sky above the courthouse to transport newsreel film and audiotapes to Tsukishima Airport in Tokyo. In short, various arrangements were made to ensure that trial proceedings could be disseminated to the United States as quickly as if they were taking place in the United States. The defendant Girard's lawyer said, "This trial is an excellent opportunity to let the American people know the fairness of Japanese trials," and secretly engaged in various activities to make the judge deliver a "ruling that would satisfy the Americans." These arrangements were not without reason.
    The murderer Girard remained under U.S. military custody and was not handed over to the Japanese side. He was only handed over to the Japanese court for custody during the court proceedings, but was returned to the U.S. military during breaks.
    On the morning of August 26, several jeeps of the U.S. military police corps constantly sped along the road from Girard's U.S. military Oizumi barracks to the Maebashi District Court, serving as guards. Girard, sandwiched between legal advisor Major Riben and Military Police Major Jones, arrived at the Maebashi District Court in a U.S. military vehicle, preceded by a Japanese police jeep. After getting out of the car, Girard, with a pale face, entered the courtroom under police escort, passing through a crowd of more than a thousand people waiting to see the face of this murderer.
    Sitting in the audience was Kayoko Sakai, the second daughter of the deceased Sakai Nakako, representing the victim's six orphaned children. She watched Girard with resentment. Before Kayoko entered the courtroom, many reporters surrounded her, asking her to express her thoughts. She replied, "I hope Girard will be tried fairly as the murderer who killed my mother." It is clear that Girard intentionally lured and killed Sakai Nakako. However, the Japanese prosecuting authorities indicted him for inflicting injury resulting in death. According to Japanese criminal law, murderers are sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for more than three years. The crime of inflicting injury resulting in death carries a sentence of two to fifteen years, and often can be suspended. Girard is clearly a murderer, so why was he indicted for inflicting injury resulting in death? This cannot but raise doubts.
    However, after the trial began, Girard denied his crimes. He denied that he had scattered bullet casings to lure people. He said he had no intention of harming people, and that he fired his gun only to "intimidate" people. The lawyer defending Girard supported Girard's sophistry, and insisted that it was nothing more than injury resulting in death due to negligence in the performance of his duties.
    This is a commonly used American tactic. During the twelve years of the U.S. military occupation of Japan, hundreds, even thousands, of Japanese people were murdered like ants, with no recourse for their grievances! After Sakai Nakako was murdered this time, the U.S. military authorities also said it was "death by stray bullet," trying to make the matter disappear into thin air.
    However, from the struggles against U.S. military bases in Sunagawa and Okinawa, the Japanese people, possessing national dignity, can no longer remain silent. Twelve years of anger has erupted. The anti-American demonstrations by the people of Taiwan triggered by the Reynolds incident further encouraged the Japanese people and strengthened their will to fight. The Japanese people finally won the right to a proper trial for the murderer Girard.
    However, Washington's intentions are cunning. On the one hand, they acknowledged Japan's right to try him, in order to ease the anger of the Japanese people; on the other hand, they put pressure on the trial, so that the trial would result in a outcome favorable to the U.S. side, in order to deceive the Japanese people and domestic U.S. public opinion, and maintain "Japan-U.S. friendship."
    In the first public hearing, the presiding judge conducted the interrogation, the prosecution read the indictment and presented evidence, and applied for witnesses, etc., before it concluded.
    Akakubo Shigemi, a Socialist Party member of parliament elected from Gunma Prefecture, who had been fighting to hold the U.S. military responsible since the incident occurred, spoke about his impressions after attending the first public hearing. He said: "The entire trial process is being swayed by American pressure. The interrogation of Girard had a obsequious, 'please do this and that' flavor, not like the words of a judge to a defendant. This tone makes one feel uneasy about the future of the trial."
    The Kanto Regional Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, which was held on August 24 and 25, also issued a statement on the Girard incident and the incident on August 2 in Ibaraki Prefecture in which a U.S. military aircraft killed a Japanese person (the Japanese prosecuting authorities have decided not to prosecute), and the incident in Yokosuka last October in which a U.S. soldier shot and killed a Japanese person but the Japanese court acquitted him on the grounds of drunkenness. They demanded that all U.S. soldiers who have committed murder be immediately handed over to the Japanese side, and punished after a strict trial.
    The Japanese people are continuing to watch the Girard trial. They will continue to struggle to win a fair trial, uphold justice, and maintain Japan's national dignity!

    公正地审判美国杀人犯！
    ——哲腊德审判旁听记——
    蓝海
    从东京乘火车走两个多小时，便到达以 “赤城山”和养蚕而知名的群马县中心城市前桥。曾经轰动日美两国舆论、并成为举世注目焦点的“哲腊德案件”的审判，8月26日在这里举行了第一次公审。这个审判将继续到10月底始能结束、宣判。    在第一次公审的当天，拥到前桥地方裁判所门前的几百名工人、农民和市民，高举着标语牌，上面写着：“公正地裁判美国杀人犯！”、“不许做出讨好美国佬的裁判！”“把哲腊德交给日本方面看管！”等等许多口号。这些口号明确地表示了日本人民对裁判的要求。可是，第一次公审却已显示出了有背叛日本人民的这种正义要求的迹象。
    在“国际裁判”的漂亮字眼的掩盖下，法庭内外都显然带有一种浓厚的美国色彩。日本人的一般旁听者仅限入场三十五名，要求参加旁听的五百多人（其中有些人是头一天夜里就排队等着的），不得不进行抽签。然而，在法庭里，穿军服或便服的美国人，却占据着特别席位。根据日美行政协定，除有两名美国政府代表作为陪审官以外，法庭上还并排坐着美国陆军长官代表、美国大使代表、美国参议院法制委员会首席顾问、驻日美军司令代表、美国退伍军人协会代表等等，他们傲然倨坐，在向“日本的乡下法官”施加威压。国内外记者被限制为四十二人，其中美国各通讯社、报社记者就占了十名以上。
    法庭的外面也同样在驻日美国陆军的协助下。裁判所周围的旅馆和店铺，被十几家外国通讯机关所租用，在那里设立了临时分社，其中大部分是美国的。驻在神奈川县的驻日美国陆军情报部派出了拉普少校等六名工作人员，在裁判所对面的群马县县公署院内设立了联络办事处，并且在看管哲腊德的大泉町美军兵营内设立了记者室，对美国记者团提供了无微不至的招待。另外，在裁判所的上空有美军六架直升飞机在等着把新闻影片的胶片和录音带运送到东京月岛机场去。总之，为了使审判情况能够像在美国国内进行一样迅速地传布到美国，作了种种安排。被告哲腊德的律师说：“这次审判，是让美国人民知道日本裁判的公正性的绝好机会”，并且为了使法官作出“能使美国人满意的裁判”，暗地里进行了种种活动。这些安排是不无原因的。
    杀人犯哲腊德依然处于美军看管之下，而没有交给日本方面。只是在法庭审判进行中，交给日本裁判所看管，但一到休息时，就又交给了美军。
    8月26日早晨，从哲腊德所在的美军大泉兵营直到前桥地方裁判所，有美军宪兵队的几辆吉普不断地奔驰在沿路担当警戒。哲腊德夹在法律顾问里宾少校和宪兵少校琼斯中间，坐着美军汽车，并有日本警察的吉普为之前导，来到了前桥地方裁判所。下车之后，哲腊德苍白着脸色，在警察押护下，穿过等着瞧瞧这个杀人犯的嘴脸的一千多名群众的行列进入了法庭。
    旁听席上坐着被害者坂井奈加子的六个遗儿的代表、死者的次女佳代子。她含着怨恨注视着哲腊德。佳代子进入法庭之前，许多记者把她包围住，要她发表感想。她回答说：“希望把哲腊德当作杀害了我的母亲的杀人犯加以公正审判。”哲腊德杀害坂井奈加子，很明显地是有意的诱杀。可是，日本检察当局却以伤害致死罪起诉。根据日本刑法，杀人犯要判死刑、无期徒刑或三年以上徒刑。伤害致死罪则判两年以上十五年以下的徒刑，并且常常可以缓期执行。哲腊德明明是杀人犯，为什么以伤害致死罪起诉，这是不能不令人置疑的。
    但是审判开始以后，哲腊德抵赖他的罪行。他否认他曾经散布子弹壳引诱人。他说，他无意伤害人，他开枪只是为了“恐吓”人。为哲腊德辩护的律师支持哲腊德的狡辩，也硬说这不过是由于执行公务中的过失而伤害致死的。
    这是美国惯用的手段。在美军占领日本的十二年间，有几百、几千的日本人像蝼蚁似地遭到杀害而哭告无门啊！这次坂井奈加子被杀害，美军当局也说什么“中流弹致死”，想把事情归于烟消火灭。
    但是，从砂川、冲绳的反对美国军事基地的斗争中，具有民族尊严的日本人民，不能再沉默了。十二年来的愤怒暴发了。由雷诺事件引起的台湾人民的反美大示威，又鼓舞了日本人民，坚定了他们的斗争意志。日本人民终于争得了对于杀人犯哲腊德的应有的审判权。
    然而华盛顿的意图是狡猾的。他们一方面承认了日本方面的审判权，以图缓和日本人民的愤怒；另一方面又对审判施加压力，使审判得到有利于美国方面的结果，以图欺蒙日本人民和美国国内舆论，维系“日美友好”。
    第一回公审，只是由裁判长进行了审讯，检察方面宣读起诉书和陈述证据，申请证人等便告结束。
    从事件发生当时就一直为追究美军责任而斗争的由群马县选出的社会党议员茜久保重光，谈了他对第一次公审旁听后的印象。他说：“整个审判过程，是为美国压力所左右的。对哲腊德的审讯，带有‘请您如何如何’的卑躬屈节的味道，不像是裁判长对待被告的话。这种调子，使人不能不对今后的审判抱有不安之感。”
    8月24、25两日举行的日本共产党关东地方委员会，也就哲腊德事件以及8月2日茨城县发生的美军飞机撞死日本人事件（日本检察当局已决定不起诉）、去年10月在横须贺一美兵枪杀日本人而日本裁判所竟以酒醉为由无罪开释等事件发表声明，要求把所有犯了杀人罪的美兵立即交给日本方面，经过严正的审裁加以处罚。
    对于哲腊德审判，日本人民是在继续注视着的。他们将继续进行斗争，争取公正地裁判，维护正义，维护日本的民族尊严！
