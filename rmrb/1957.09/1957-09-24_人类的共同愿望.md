    The United Nations General Assembly's twelfth session has just begun, and it has already clearly demonstrated the fierce struggle between two different international policies at this meeting. On the one hand, the United States and its partners are trying their best to continue using the United Nations as a tool to incite the Cold War, poison the international atmosphere, and create tension. The United States and its partners' opposition to including the "China Representation Issue" on the agenda, while forcing the General Assembly to discuss the so-called "Hungarian Question," as well as U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's speech on September 19th continuing to promote military blocs and the arms race, all demonstrate this point. On the other hand, the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries are actively working to strengthen the role of the United Nations and peaceful cooperation between countries. To this end, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko submitted a series of very important peace proposals to the United Nations General Assembly on September 20th.
    The Soviet peace proposals include: 1. A draft declaration on the peaceful coexistence of states; 2. A draft resolution on the cessation of nuclear weapon testing for two to three years under international supervision; 3. A draft resolution on the obligation of states not to use atomic weapons; 4. A memorandum on partial disarmament measures. In addition to the above proposals, the Soviet Union also reiterated its many specific proposals for guaranteeing peace in the Middle East and guaranteeing peace in Europe. There is no doubt that this is another major action by the Soviet Union to continue to ease international tensions and consolidate world peace. It is fully in line with the aspirations of the people of all countries and their vital interests.
    The current development of the international situation has two extremely clear paths: one path is to strengthen international cooperation and achieve peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems; the other path is an endless nuclear arms race, which may ultimately lead to an atomic war that would cause great disasters to mankind. The people of all countries are firmly opposed to the nuclear arms race and the threat of atomic war, and they choose the former path, which is the path of peaceful coexistence. Only in this way can the people of all countries live in peace and seek their respective development.
    The draft declaration on the peaceful coexistence of states proposed by the Soviet Union is precisely to meet this aspiration of the people of all countries. In this declaration, the Soviet Union put forward the famous five principles of peaceful coexistence, requiring all countries to follow these principles in their mutual relations. These five principles of peaceful coexistence have not only been accepted by most countries in Asia and Africa and many European countries, but their mutual relations have also long been established on the basis of these principles. The relations between China and most Asian and African countries, as well as the relations between the Soviet Union and most Asian and African countries and some European countries, are examples of this peaceful coexistence relationship. Precisely because of this, China, the Soviet Union, and most Asian and African countries, as well as some European countries, have been able to continuously strengthen mutual cooperation and continuously develop mutual economic and cultural exchanges. This has a great influence on maintaining and developing world peace and international cooperation.
    Accepting the Soviet proposal and taking the principles of peaceful coexistence as the universal准则 of mutual relations between countries will undoubtedly further strengthen world peace and international cooperation and greatly ease international tensions. Many of the problems that exist in the current international situation are caused by imperialist countries violating the principle of the inviolability of other countries' sovereignty, attempting to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and even blatantly carrying out subversive activities. The most obvious example is the recent multifaceted aggression by the United States against Syria, and its unbridled threat of armed intervention to Syria's independence and security, thereby creating tension in the Middle East and the danger of rekindling the flames of war in the Middle East. Therefore, to eliminate this tension, it is necessary for all countries to abide by the principles of peaceful coexistence and non-interference in internal affairs in international relations, so as to stop the aggressive delusions of the United States. The Soviet Union's proposal that the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union shall not use force in the Middle East and shall not interfere in the internal affairs of the countries in this region in any way is precisely to maintain peace in the Middle East. At the same time, this proposal is also fully in line with the principles of peaceful coexistence and non-interference in internal affairs in international relations.
    Of course, the most fundamental way to consolidate lasting world peace is to completely resolve the issue of disarmament, that is, for all countries to massively reduce armaments and unconditionally prohibit the use and manufacture of atomic and hydrogen weapons. The Soviet Union has continuously made great efforts in this regard, especially by putting forward a series of proposals at the Subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission. However, because the United States and its partners are fundamentally unwilling to disarm, but only indulge in empty talk about "open skies," "providing (arms) lists," and the ghost words of "peaceful use of outer space," attempting to use this to obtain military intelligence and unilaterally weaken the self-defense forces of the peace camp, the disarmament negotiations finally failed to reach an agreement. Therefore, in order to promote the realization of disarmament, and in order to free mankind from the threat of an endless arms race, all peace-loving countries and people must continue to work hard, continuously exert various pressures on the United States and its partners, and break down the obstacles they have placed on the road to disarmament.
    The Soviet Union has unswervingly shouldered this task. In addition to submitting the Soviet government's memorandum on partial disarmament measures to the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet Union also put forward two proposals regarding the obligation of states not to use atomic weapons and the cessation of nuclear weapon testing for two to three years under international supervision, requesting the General Assembly to discuss them. Both of these proposals are very simple and easy to implement. The realization of these two proposals can alleviate the fear of atomic war and the unease about nuclear weapon testing among the people of all countries, and will create favorable conditions for moving towards further disarmament agreements. If the United States and its partners continue to reject these proposals, they cannot but be condemned by fair public opinion in all countries, and will face an even more isolated situation.
    Peaceful coexistence and the realization of disarmament have become the common aspirations of mankind in our era. In opposition to this aspiration is the policy of aggression, expansion, and arms expansion and war preparation of the United States and other imperialist countries. This antagonistic struggle is clearly reflected in this session of the United Nations General Assembly. The majority of member states of the United Nations General Assembly should follow the common aspirations of the people of all countries and make our era truly move towards the path of peaceful coexistence.

### 人类的共同愿望

    人类的共同愿望
    联合国大会第十二届会议刚刚开始，就已鲜明地显示出在这个会议上的两种不同的国际政策的激烈斗争。一方面是美国和它的一些伙伴，竭力想把联合国继续作为煽动冷战的工具，来毒化国际气氛，制造紧张局势。美国和它的伙伴们反对把“中国代表权问题”列入议程，同时又强使大会讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”，以及美国国务卿杜勒斯9月19日发表的继续推行军事集团和扩军备战的演说，都表明了这一点。另一方面，是苏联和其他爱好和平的国家积极地为加强联合国的作用和国际间的和平合作而努力，为此，苏联外交部长葛罗米柯已于9月20日向联合国大会提出了一系列十分重要的和平建议。
    苏联的和平建议有：一、关于各国和平共处的宣言草案，二、关于在国际监督下停止试验核武器两年到三年的决议草案，三、关于各国承担不使用原子武器的义务的决议草案，四、关于局部裁军措施的备忘录。除了上述的建议之外，苏联还重申了它关于保障中近东和平和保障欧洲和平的许多具体主张。毫无疑问，这是苏联谋求继续缓和国际紧张局势和巩固世界和平的又一重大行动。它是完全符合于各国人民的愿望和他们的切身利益的。
    目前国际局势的发展，有着两条极其清楚的道路：一条道路是加强国际合作，实现不同社会制度的国家之间的和平共处；另一条道路是无休止的核武器军备竞赛，最终可能导致一场对人类造成极大灾害的原子战争。各国人民是坚决反对核武器军备竞赛和原子战争的威胁的，他们选择的是前一条道路，也就是和平共处的道路。因为只有这样，各国人民才能在和平中生活，才能谋求各自的发展。
    苏联提出的关于各国和平共处的宣言草案，正是为了满足各国人民的这种愿望。在这个宣言中苏联提出了著名的和平共处的五项原则，要求各国在相互关系中遵循这些原则。这个和平共处的五项原则，不但早已为亚洲和非洲的大多数国家和许多欧洲国家所接受，并且它们之间的相互关系也早已建立在这些原则的基础之上了。中国和大多数亚非国家的关系，以及苏联和大多数亚非国家和一些欧洲国家的关系，就是这种和平共处关系的榜样。正是因为这样，中国、苏联和大多数亚非国家以及一些欧洲国家之间，就能够不断地加强相互之间的合作，不断地发展相互之间的经济和文化交流。这对于维护和发展世界和平和国际合作事业有着极大的影响。
    接受苏联的建议，把和平共处的原则作为各国相互关系的普遍准则，无疑将可以更进一步加强世界和平和国际合作，大大地缓和国际的紧张局势。目前国际局势中存在的许多问题，都是由于帝国主义国家违反其他国家主权不可侵犯的原则，妄图干涉其他国家的内政，甚至明目张胆地进行颠覆活动所造成的。最明显的是最近美国对叙利亚展开了多方面的侵略活动，并肆无忌惮地以武装干涉来威胁叙利亚的独立和安全，从而造成了中东的紧张局势，使中东有重新燃起战火的危险。因此，要消除这种紧张局势，就必须使各国在国际关系中遵守和平共处和不干涉他国内政的原则，以制止美国的侵略妄想。苏联主张美、英、法、苏四国不得在中近东地区使用武力，不得对这个地区国家的内政有任何干涉，正是为了维护中东地区的和平。同时，这个主张也是完全符合在国际关系中实行和平共处和不干涉他国内政的原则的。
    当然，巩固世界持久和平的最根本的办法，是彻底解决裁军问题，即各国大规模地裁减军备，并无条件地禁止使用与制造原子武器和氢武器。苏联在这方面曾不断地作了巨大的努力，特别是在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会上提出了一系列的建议。但是，由于美国和它的伙伴根本不愿意裁军，只是侈谈什么“开放天空”、“提供（军备）清单”以及“和平利用外空”的鬼话，企图以此取得军事情报和片面地削弱和平阵营的自卫力量，终于使裁军谈判不能达成协议。因此，为了促进裁军的实现，为了使人类摆脱无止境的军备竞赛的威胁，一切爱好和平的国家和人民还要继续努力，不断地对美国及其伙伴施加各种压力，打破它们在裁军道路上所布置的障碍。
    苏联义不容辞地担负了这个任务。除了将苏联政府关于局部裁军措施的备忘录提交联合国大会之外，苏联还提出了关于各国承担不使用原子武器的义务和在国际监督下停止试验核武器两年到三年的两项建议，要求大会讨论。这两项建议都是十分简单易行的。实现这两项建议就可以减轻各国人民对于原子战争的恐惧和对核武器试验的不安，并将为走向进一步达成裁军协议造成有利的条件。美国及其伙伴如果继续拒绝这些建议，就不能不受到各国公正舆论的谴责，就将面临更加孤立的处境。
    和平共处和实现裁军，已成为我们这个时代的人类的共同愿望。同这种愿望相对立的，是美国和其他帝国主义国家的侵略扩张和扩军备战的政策。这种对立的斗争清楚地反映在这一届的联合国大会上。联合国大会的大多数会员国家应当遵循各国人民的共同愿望，使我们这个时代真正走向和平共处的道路。
