　　Flowers of Construction
　　Yangtze River Bridge Appraisal Completed
　　The scientific appraisal work on the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, which lasted a week, concluded on the 10th. In the next week or so, the scientific appraisal staff will draw a comprehensive conclusion on the quality of this newly built bridge.
　　Electricity Lights up Sichuan Province
　　Sichuan Province now has an average of one small power plant or hydropower station in each county. Many towns and cities already use electricity for rice milling, flour milling, oil pressing, cotton ginning, water lifting for irrigation, repairing agricultural tools, and lighting. During the Five-Year Plan period, Sichuan Province has newly built and expanded five power plants, restored and developed more than 130 regional and county power plants distributed throughout the province, and also built 95 rural small hydropower stations.
　　Qingdao's Granite
　　In a state-owned factory near Fushan in the suburbs of Qingdao, a large amount of unusual stone - granite - is produced every year. This granite is tough, fine-grained, and contains more crystals. Each piece of stone mined has sparkling, black and white crystalline florets that resemble stars on a light yellow background, making them very beautiful and resistant to weathering and discoloration.
　　Multi-Pod Cotton
　　Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan Town, Linzhang County, Hebei Province, is growing 1.2 mu of extraordinary cotton - multi-pod cotton. The cotton bolls on the cotton plants grow together like twin lotus flowers. Each plant typically has 17 cotton bolls, with one plant having as many as 54, several times more than ordinary cotton. This multi-pod cotton has three major advantages: high yield, good quality, and no wild branches.
　　Tianjin Carpets are Brightly Colored
　　The hands of Tianjin carpet workers are very skillful. On a carpet with a "Nine Dragons Playing in the Sea" pattern, deep blue is used as the base to symbolize the sea, and slightly green waves are woven around the edges. Nine large dragons with golden scales shine and are about to take off and fly. In recent years, Tianjin carpet workers have woven at least a thousand different patterns of carpets. The color of the carpets does not change even after being exposed to the sun and washed with water. Tianjin carpets are warmly welcomed abroad at many international exhibitions.
　　Tussah Silk is Famous at Home and Abroad
　　The ideal summer clothing material that is heat-resistant, moisture-absorbing, beautiful, and durable - Liaoning tussah silk has become a hot commodity in short supply in domestic and foreign markets. Currently, it is selling well in more than 20 countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa. By the end of August this year, the production of tussah silk and spun silk has increased by about three times compared to the annual output in 1952 before the start of the Five-Year Plan. There are already 49 types of specifications.
　　Exporting Over 7,000 Tons of Fish Meal
　　The state-owned Zhoushan Fish Meal Factory, newly built during the First Five-Year Plan, has exported more than 7,000 tons of fish meal from the time it went into production in 1955 to August this year. Fish meal is a high-grade feed for livestock and poultry. Livestock that eat fish meal will gain weight and increase their reproductive capacity; dairy cows that eat it will increase milk production; chickens and ducks that eat it will lay more eggs.

　　建设的花朵
    长江大桥鉴定结束
    历时一周的武汉长江大桥科学鉴定工作已在10日结束。在今后一周多的时间内，科学鉴定工作人员将对这座新建桥的质量作出全面的结论。
    电光普照四川省
    四川省现在平均每个县都有一个小电厂或水电站，许多城镇已用电力来碾米、磨面、榨油、轧花、提水灌溉、修理农具和照明。四川省在五年计划期间已经新建和扩建了五座发电厂，恢复和发展了分布在全省各地的一百三十多个专区、县的电厂，同时还建设了九十五个农村小型水电站。
    青岛的花岗石
    在青岛郊区浮山附近的一个地方国营工厂里，每年都生产出大量的不平常的石头——花岗石。这种花岗石质地坚韧、颗粒细致，而且含有较多的水晶体。开采出来的每一块石料，在淡黄色的底子上，都有着像繁星一样的黑白相间的晶莹小花在闪烁，显得十分美观，而且经久不易风化变色。
    多桃棉花
    河北省临漳县城关镇红光农业社种着一亩二分奇异的棉花——多桃棉花。棉棵上的棉铃像并蒂莲一样生长在一起。每株一般有十七个棉铃，多的一棵达五十四个，比一般棉花结的棉铃多好几倍。这种多桃棉花有三大好处：产量高、质量好、不长疯杈。
    天津地毯色泽鲜艳
    天津地毯工人的双手非常灵巧。在一块“九龙闹海”为图案的地毯上，以深蓝色为底象征海水，四边织出了微绿的波涛，九条金鳞闪光的大龙势欲腾空飞起。最近几年内，天津地毯工人至少织出了一千多种图案的地毯。地毯的色泽，虽经日晒水洗也不变。在许多国际展览会上，天津地毯受到国外热烈欢迎。
    柞蚕绸驰名中外
    抗热、吸湿又美观耐用的夏季理想衣料——辽宁柞蚕绸已经成为国内外市场上供不应求的热货。目前它已畅销到欧、亚、非三洲的二十多个国家。今年到8月底止，柞蚕丝绸和绢绸的生产量比五年计划开始前1952年的全年产量提高约三倍。品种规格已经有四十九种。
    出口七千多吨鱼粉
    第一个五年计划期间新建的地方国营舟山鱼粉厂，从1955年投入生产到今年8月止，已出口了七千多吨鱼粉。鱼粉是牲畜和家禽的高级饲料。牲畜吃了鱼粉会增加体重，增加生殖能力；奶牛吃了会增加产乳量；鸡鸭吃了会多下蛋。（以上据新华社讯）
