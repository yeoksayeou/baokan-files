Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 29th - The Party branch of Yangdai Township, Jinjiang County, led more than 240 educated youths in the township to conduct a "big blooming, big contending" debate. The questions debated were: Do educated youths have a future participating in agricultural production? Does the Party care about educated youths in the countryside?

A small number of educated youths, especially young people from wealthier families who were more tainted by a love of ease and a pursuit of fame and gain, expressed opinions at the debate such as "educated youths have no future in the countryside," "the Party branch does not cultivate them," and "the Party dares not let go and use educated youths." Many educated youths and farmers from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds argued with them, using vivid facts from their township and their own experiences. Lin Shuqing, a graduate of junior high school, said: "The future is something you have to strive for. Sitting at home all day without training through labor and without contributing your knowledge to agricultural production, the future will not fall from the sky. I returned to my hometown after graduating from junior high school in 1953 and participated in agricultural production. Now I am the deputy director of the cooperative. If I don't befriend the land and stay at home all day, then indeed I would have no future." Cooperative member Shi Shengqu said: "When you say there is no future, you are actually looking down on agricultural labor." Li Wenzhan, an old upper-middle peasant who returned to his hometown after graduating in 1953, protested: "What future is there in holding a hoe for a lifetime?" Middle peasant Li Cuiying said: "If you are not content to hold a hoe now and do not honestly learn production, you will neither have the ability to become intellectuals in the future nor the qualifications to be farmers." Some young people expressed the opinion that the income from working in the countryside was low, which was also opposed by many people. Poor peasant Huang Chaosong said: "What kind of revolution is it to want to make a lot of money as soon as you do something? If everyone is like you, who will carry out the great cause of liberation for China's 600 million people?" These words left Li Wenzhan speechless. Does the Party care about educated youths in the countryside? Everyone debated this question very fiercely. Li Shengming said: "Most of the 58 educated youths in our village are content with production and work actively. Twenty-two have joined the Communist Youth League, and now three are township government cadres, two are Youth League branch committee members, two are primary school teachers, and eleven are teachers in people's schools. Isn't this the result of the Party's concern and cultivation of educated youths in the countryside? Is it that the Party does not trust educated youths?"

Through more than 20 days of debate and with the education and assistance of veteran farmers, more than 200 educated youths in Yangdai Township gradually distinguished between right and wrong, took the initiative to get closer to the Party branch, and more readily and actively participated in production and various rural work.

    知识青年参加农业生产有无前途？
    福建晋江洋埭乡二百多名知识青年展开辩论
    据新华社福州29日电　中共晋江县洋埭乡党支部领导全乡二百四十多名知识青年大鸣大放大辩论。辩论的问题是：知识青年参加农业生产有没有前途？党对在农村的知识青年是否关怀？
    有一小部分知识青年，特别是出身于富裕家庭，较多沾染了好逸恶劳、贪名好利的小伙子，在辩论会上发表了“知识青年在农村没有前途”、“党支部对他们不培养”、“党对知识青年不敢放手使用”等意见。很多贫农和下中农成分的知识青年和农民，都以本乡和本人的生动事实和他们说理争论。高小毕业生林淑卿说：“前途是靠人去争取的，整天坐在家里不到劳动中锻炼，不把知识贡献给农村生产，前途是不会从天上掉下来的。1953年我高小毕业回乡，参加农业生产，现在当了副社长，假如我不和土地交朋友，整天闷在家里，那确是没前途。”社员施胜趣说：“你们说没有前途，实际上是看不起农业劳动。”1953年毕业回乡的老上中农成分的李文展声辩说：“一辈子拿锄头，还有什么前途？”中农李翠英说：“现在不安心拿锄头，不老老实实学生产，将来既没有本事当知识分子，也没有资格当农民。”有的青年发表在农村工作收入少的意见，也受到很多人的反对。贫农黄朝送说：“做点事就想赚大钱，这算什么革命？大家都像你们这样，中国六亿人民的翻身大业靠谁来干？”这番话说得李文展哑口无言。党是否关心农村知识青年呢？大家对这个问题的辩论也很激烈。李声明说：“我们村里的五十八个知识青年，大多安心生产，积极工作，有二十二人参加了共青团，现在有三人当乡政干部，二人当团支部委员，二人当小学教员，十一人当了民校教师，这难道不是党对农村知识青年的关心培养的结果吗？难道是党不信任知识青年吗？”
    洋埭乡二百多个知识青年，通过二十多天的大辩论和在老农民的教育帮助下，逐步分清大是大非，主动靠拢党支部，更加安心和积极参加生产和各项农村工作。
