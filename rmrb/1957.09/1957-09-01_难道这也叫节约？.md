    Is This Really Called Saving?
    The sneakers we used to buy had a piece of leather near the little toe and the side of the sole. Later, this was changed to cloth. In recent years, some rubber factories, in the name of "saving cloth," have even eliminated these two pieces of cloth. Cloth is saved, but the lifespan of the sneakers is greatly shortened.
    Sneakers with leather patches used to last eight or nine months, but now sneakers only last three or four months before they break at the little toe area. "Liberation Brand" white sneakers only last a month and a half. Can this practice really be called saving?

    难道这也叫节约？
    从前买的球鞋，在靠近小脚指和脚掌旁边的地方都有一块皮子，后来又改成布的。近两年，有些橡胶厂以“节约用布”为名，把这两块布也给取消了。布是节约了，可是球鞋的寿命大大缩短了。
    从前一双贴着皮子的球鞋能穿八九个月，现在的球鞋只穿三四个月，小脚指那地方就破了；“解放牌”的白球鞋，只能穿一个半月。这种作法，难道也能叫节约吗？
