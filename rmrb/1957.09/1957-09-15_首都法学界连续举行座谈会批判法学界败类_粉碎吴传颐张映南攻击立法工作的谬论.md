Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: Today, legal professionals participating in the symposium in the capital were highly motivated and forcefully criticized the reactionary words and deeds of rightists Wu Chuan-yi and Zhang Ying-nan in attacking the people's democratic legal system, especially the people's legislative work. Faced with the facts revealed by everyone, these two rightists had no choice but to admit their guilt.

Wu Dayu, Deputy Director of the Legislative Affairs Bureau, first refuted the rightist Wu Chuan-yi's slander that we "have no laws to follow" and "it is difficult to follow the laws." Wu Dayu said that Wu Chuan-yi's statement that "there are no laws to follow" is not in accordance with the facts. In 1949, the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference adopted the Common Program and the Organic Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, which have the nature of a provisional constitution. In 1954, the National People's Congress formulated the Constitution. In recent years, many important laws have also been formulated, such as the Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China, the Labor Insurance Regulations, the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China, the Model Regulations for Agricultural Production Cooperatives, the Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy, the Electoral Law, the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China, the Regulations on Punishing Corruption, the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries, the Regulations on Arrest and Detention, etc. Moreover, according to work needs, many separate regulations and rules have also been formulated. There are 560 of these regulations published in the "Compilation of Laws and Decrees of the Central People's Government" and 550 in the "Compilation of Laws and Regulations of the People's Republic of China." In addition, the central ministries, commissions, and former Greater Administrative Regions have promulgated nearly 3,000 regulations. Wu Dayu said that Wu Chuan-yi once served as a member of the former Legislative Affairs Commission and now works in the Legislative Affairs Bureau of the State Council, and he directly participated in the editing of the regulations compilation. He knows many important laws, separate regulations, rules, decisions, and instructions issued by our country before and after the promulgation of the Constitution. Now he still clamors "there are no laws to follow" as a legal worker, which clearly shows that he only regards the laws of the Kuomintang reactionary government as laws, and does not regard the laws of the people's democratic dictatorship as laws.

Wu Dayu said that Wu Chuan-yi also said that we "have difficulty following the laws," slandering the people's legal system as "chaotic" and "full of contradictions," and slandering our country as a world full of "violations of laws and disciplines." These are all distorted and exaggerated by Wu Chuan-yi by seizing some individual examples, and even fabricating them out of thin air. For example, he cited the "fact" that Xi'an City continued to collect cultural and entertainment taxes last year after the central government announced the regulations on exempting dramas from cultural and entertainment taxes, to attack the local government for violating the law. After checking with the State Administration of Taxation, this "fact" proved to be fabricated by Wu Chuan-yi.

Wu Dayu said that Wu Chuan-yi also slandered the People's Government for saying that "it is too early to draw conclusions on judicial reform today" and that "whether judicial reform is in line with Marxism-Leninism is still doubtful." Wu Chuan-yi also openly incited old judicial personnel to resist reform, telling them not to remove the hats of old judicial personnel. The problem is very clear, that is, he is determined to be a "filial grandson" of the old legal system, attempting to "counterattack and settle accounts," "reverse the verdict" for judicial reform, and let the old judicial personnel "come to power," thereby usurping the leadership of the Party and restoring the old legal system.

Wu Dayu said that Wu Chuan-yi slandered us for not having democracy and freedom. He said that my country's "legal system is not sound," and "democracy needs the protection of the legal system," and "the current democracy is somewhat lacking compared to the early stages of capitalism." The Communist Party is "eating level by level" and "slavishly obeying," which reflects his hatred for the Communist Party.

Wu Dayu also revealed Wu Chuan-yi's reactionary history. He said that Wu Chuan-yi is a follower and promoter of the "Vitalism" of the special agent Chen Lifu.

Wu Chuan-yi made a self-criticism at the meeting. He admitted that he took advantage of the opportunity of the great blooming and contending to release three poisonous arrows at the Communist Party and the people. The first poisonous arrow was aimed at the people's legal system; the second poisonous arrow was aimed at judicial reform; the third poisonous arrow was aimed at socialist democracy. He said that the reason why he carried out criminal activities at this time was that he believed that "the climate was suitable and he wanted to change the status quo."

Yi Jiaju, Deputy Director of the Legal Affairs Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, exposed and criticized the reactionary words and deeds of Zhang Ying-nan, a pseudo-legislative member who is now working in the Legal Affairs Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (see page 2 of this newspaper on September 13 for Zhang Ying-nan's reactionary words and deeds). Yi Jiaju said that Zhang Ying-nan's advocacy of "equal emphasis on new and old laws" is an attempt to insert a knife into the theoretical foundation of socialist law and jurisprudence, and open a gap for the restoration of the old legal system and old jurisprudence. Yi Jiaju finally said that the Party and the state insist that political and legal work move forward on the socialist road, while Zhang Ying-nan is trying to open a road for the restoration of the capitalist legal system. This is the fundamental difference between us and Zhang Ying-nan. We must resolutely fight Zhang Ying-nan to the end and defend the socialist legal system.

He Shikun, a member of the Bills Committee of the National People's Congress, pointed out in his speech that Zhang Ying-nan's fallacies such as "equal emphasis on new and old laws," "relying solely on Marxism-Leninism in law is not enough," and "the government does not pay attention to legal science" are ill-intentioned. Their essence is to restore the reactionary old laws and to have the bourgeoisie usurp the leadership of the proletariat.

Xu Ping, Vice President of the Central School of Political Science and Law Cadres, said that rightists Wu Chuan-yi and Zhang Ying-nan mainly attacked the Communist Party in terms of legislative work. The struggle between us and them is essentially a struggle between two lines in legislative work. He also said that Yang Zhao-long, a rightist in Shanghai, published an article in the Xinwen Ribao on May 9 entitled "Why Hasn't My Country's Important Legal Code Been Promulgated Yet?" It is a declaration of the legislative line of the bourgeoisie and the Kuomintang with theory and program. Immediately afterwards, rightists in legal circles in Shanghai and Beijing responded and used various methods to slander our legislative work. Xu Ping then analyzed the characteristics of the struggle between the two lines, explaining the serious political significance of the struggle. He said that our legal professionals should receive vivid education through this struggle.

Under everyone's criticism, Zhang Ying-nan admitted that he was an anti-communist and anti-socialist rightist with words and actions.

The symposium of the capital's legal circles has been held for thirty-nine sessions. Since the launch of the anti-rightist struggle, more than 200 people have used powerful facts at the meeting to conduct reasoned struggles with rightists such as Qian Duansheng, Yu Zhongluo, and Yang Yuqing, and achieved great victories. At the three symposiums before this meeting, people in the capital's legal circles also criticized the reactionary words and deeds of rightists Yang Peng and Lu Wei-qian. Yang Peng is a specialized member of the Legal Affairs Office of the Ministry of Communications. Before liberation, he served as the defense lawyer for Japanese war criminal Okamura Ningji. He has a very close relationship with rightist Zhang Bojun, who introduced him to the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. During the period of great blooming and contending, he slandered Party members, League members, and old cadres for only knowing class struggle and having no legal knowledge, which was not as good as the judicial personnel of the old society. Rightist Lu Wei-qian, a specialized member of the former Legislative Affairs Bureau who is now studying at the Socialist Academy, came from a tyrannical landlord background. During the "April 12th" massacre in 1927, he was an anti-communist expert. On the eve of liberation in 1949, he served as the chief advisor to the pseudo-Ministry of Economic Affairs. When the Chiang-Yan bandit gang organized the "Action Cabinet" before the liberation of Chongqing, Lu Wei-qian participated in the wartime system meeting of the pseudo-Ministry of Economic Affairs, plotting criminal activities such as guerrilla warfare. After liberation, he consistently refused ideological reform. During the great blooming and contending, he viciously attacked the people's legal system, saying that the reason for the backwardness of the legal system work was that the legal system organs were dominated by the "three evils." He also said that the reason why the Criminal Law could not be drawn up for a long time was because "Party members who had not studied criminal law were doing the leadership work of drafting the Criminal Law."

The symposium of the capital's legal circles will continue to be held.

　　首都法学界连续举行座谈会批判法学界败类
    粉碎吴传颐张映南攻击立法工作的谬论
    据新华社14日讯  今天，参加首都法学界座谈会的法学界人士斗志高昂，有力地批判了右派分子吴传颐、张映南向人民民主法制特别是向人民立法工作进攻的反动言行。这两个右派分子在大家所揭发的事实面前，不得不低头认罪。
    法制局副局长吴大羽首先驳斥了右派分子吴传颐污蔑我们“无法可依”和“有法难依”的谰言。吴大羽说，吴传颐所说的“无法可依”是不符事实的。在1949年，中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议即通过了具有临时宪法性质的共同纲领和中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法。1954年全国人民代表大会制定了宪法。几年来，还制定了许多重要的法律，如中华人民共和国工会法、劳动保险条例、中华人民共和国土地改革法、农业生产合作社示范章程、民族区域自治实施纲要、选举法、中华人民共和国婚姻法、中华人民共和国兵役法、惩治贪污条例、惩治反革命条例、逮捕拘留条例等等；并且根据工作需要，还制订了许多单行条例和规章。这些法规，刊载在“中央人民政府法令汇编”中的有五百六十件，刊载在“中华人民共和国法规汇编”中的有五百五十件，此外，中央各部、会和前大行政区公布的还有近三千件法规。吴大羽说，吴传颐曾任前法制委员会委员，现在国务院法制局工作，并且曾经直接参加法规汇编的编辑工作，对于我们国家在宪法公布前后所发布的许多重要法律、单行条例、规章、决定、指示等，他是知道的。他现在还要以法制工作者的身份来叫嚣“无法可依”，显然看出他只是把国民党反动政府的法才看做法，而把人民民主专政的法，不看做法。
    吴大羽说，吴传颐又说我们是“有法难依”，把人民法制污蔑成是“乱七八糟”、“矛盾百出”，把我们的国家诬蔑成到处都是“违法乱纪”的世界。这些都是吴传颐抓住一些个别例子进行歪曲、夸大，甚至无中生有地捏造出来的。例如：他举出西安市在去年中央公布戏剧免征文化娱乐税的规定以后，仍继续征收文化娱乐税的“事实”，来攻击地方政府违法。这个“事实”经向税务总局查对，证明是吴传颐捏造的。
    吴大羽说，吴传颐还污蔑人民政府“对司法改革今天作结论还早”，说司法改革“是否合乎马列主义还值得怀疑”。吴传颐还公开煽动旧法人员抵抗改造，要他们不要摘掉旧法人员的帽子。问题很清楚，那就是他坚决要做旧法统的“孝子贤孙”，企图“反攻倒算”，为司法改革“翻案”，让旧法人员“上台”，从而篡夺党的领导，使旧法复辟。
    吴大羽说，吴传颐污蔑我们没有民主自由，他说我国“法制不健全”，而“民主是要法制保护的”，“目前的民主比资本主义初期总是有些欠缺”。共产党是“一级吃一级”“奴性的服从”，这正反映了他对共产党的仇恨。
    吴大羽还揭发了吴传颐的反动历史。他说吴传颐是特务头子陈立夫“唯生论”的信徒和宣传者”。
    吴传颐在会上作了检查。他承认利用大鸣大放的机会，向共产党和人民放出了三支毒箭。第一支毒箭是射向人民法制；第二支毒箭是射向司法改革；第三支毒箭是射向社会主义民主。他说，他所以在这个时候进行罪恶的活动，是他认为“气候适宜的时候到了，想起来改变现状”。
    全国人民代表大会常委会法律室副主任易家驹揭露和批判了伪立法委员、现在全国人民代表大会常委会法律室工作的张映南的反动言行（张映南的反动言行见9月13日本报二版）。易家驹说，张映南的“新旧法并重”的主张是企图在社会主义法律和法学的理论基础上插一把刀子，为旧法统和旧法学的复辟打开一个缺口。易家驹最后说，党和国家坚持政法工作在社会主义道路上前进，而张映南却企图开辟一个资本主义法统复辟的道路，这就是我们和张映南的根本分歧，我们要坚决同张映南斗争到底，保卫社会主义法制。
    全国人民代表大会法案委员会委员何世琨在发言中指出张映南所说的“新旧法并重”、“在法律上单靠马列主义是不够的”、“政府不重视法律科学”等谬论是别有用心的，其实质就是要反动的旧法复辟，要资产阶级起来篡夺无产阶级的领导权。
    中央政法干部学校副校长徐平说，右派分子吴传颐、张映南主要是在立法工作方面向共产党进攻。我们和他们进行斗争，实质上是立法工作上两条路线的斗争。他又说，上海的右派分子杨兆龙5月9日在新闻日报上发表的“我国重要法典何以迟迟还不颁布？”是一篇有理论、有纲领的资产阶级、国民党立法路线的宣言。紧接着上海、北京两地法学界右派分子起而响应，用各种方法污蔑我们的立法工作。徐平接着分析了这两条路线斗争的特点说明斗争的严重政治意义。他说，我们法学界人士应通过这场斗争得到生动的教育。
    张映南在大家的批判下，承认自己是有言论和行动的反共反社会主义的右派分子。
    首都法学界座谈会已开了三十九次会议。从开展反右派斗争以来，有二百多人在会上用有力的事实，与钱端升、俞钟骆、杨玉清等右派分子进行了说理斗争，取得了很大的胜利。在这次会前的三次座谈会上，首都法学界人士还批判了右派分子杨鹏和卢蔚乾的反动言行。杨鹏是交通部法律室专门委员，解放前做过日本战犯冈村宁次的辩护人。他和右派分子章伯钧的关系很密切，他参加农工民主党是章伯钧介绍的。在大鸣大放期间，他污蔑党员、团员和老干部只懂得阶级斗争，没有法律知识，还不如旧社会的审判人员。原法制局专门委员、现在社会主义学院学习的右派分子卢蔚乾是恶霸地主出身。1927年“四·一二”大屠杀时，他就是反共能手。1949年解放前夕，他任伪经济部首席顾问。蒋阎匪帮在重庆解放前组织“行动内阁”时，卢蔚乾参加了伪经济部的战时体制会议，策划进行游击战争等罪恶勾当。解放后一贯拒绝思想改造，在大鸣大放时，他恶毒地向人民法制进攻，说法制工作落后的原因是法制机关为“三害”所支配。他又说，刑法所以迟迟不能订出，就是因为“没有学过刑法的党员在做刑法起草的领导工作”。
    首都法学界座谈会将继续举行。
