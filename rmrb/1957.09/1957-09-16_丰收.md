	Heilongjiang Honey

	Heilongjiang Province, one of China's honey production bases, has a honey output of 800 tons this year, six times more than last year. Beeswax production can reach 60,000 tons, eight times more than in 1956. The honey produced is white in color, delicious in taste, and of very good quality.

	Farmers in some areas of Heilongjiang Province have traditionally had the habit of beekeeping. In recent years, the beekeeping industry has developed greatly with the support of the government. According to statistics, there were 19 key beekeeping counties last year, which has increased to 61 this year. The number of beehives has increased from 40,000 last year to 60,000 this year. The relevant provincial departments recently formulated a beekeeping plan in accordance with the principle of active and steady expansion. The plan stipulates that from this year to 1962, the number of beehives will increase annually at a rate of 50%, and by 1962, efforts will be made to reach 250,000 to 350,000 beehives. The commercial honey production will gradually increase from 50 jin per hive to 150 jin. In areas with a good foundation and suitable for beekeeping, efforts will be made to achieve beekeeping in every cooperative by 1962 (with an average of 50 beehives per agricultural cooperative), and gradually develop beekeeping by cooperative members' families.
