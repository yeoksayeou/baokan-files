Facts Since Liberation Prove That Luo Longji's Reactionary Activities Have Not Stopped

(Our Dispatch) The Central Committee of the China Democratic League held its ninth rectification symposium on the afternoons of August 30 and 31. At this symposium, Li Wenyi, Sa Kongliao, and members of Luo Longji's anti-Communist group, such as Zhao Wenbi and Zeng Zhaolun, exposed a large number of facts (including a large number of secret letters from Luo Longji), once again proving that this group has consistently engaged in anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist conspiracies. Moreover, this activity did not stop after 1952, but only adopted more covert methods.

Luo Longji Admits He Had Plans to Expand "Invisible Organizations," But Does Not Discuss Activities After 1952

At this meeting, Luo Longji confessed to some of the activities of his reactionary group before 1952. He admitted that he and Zhang Dongsun had formed a small clique. The purpose of this small clique was to seize the leadership of the China Democratic League. Luo Longji said that he had the motivation to engage in "invisible organizations" before the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and he had been active after Japan's surrender. After liberation, Zhou Jingwen, Ye Duyi, Pan Guangdan, Zeng Zhaolun, Liu Wang Liming, Fan Puzhai, Zhang Zhihe, Luo Hanxian, and others either did not get jobs or felt that their arrangements were inappropriate, and often complained. Luo Longji "intended to unite this group of people into a force within the League." He discussed it with Zhang Dongsun, and Zhang agreed. This began the "invisible organization" within the Beijing League. Luo Longji admitted that the people in his small clique had launched a series of struggles against the progressive forces within the League in various places. In Shanghai, they supported Peng Wenying in the struggle against Shi Liang; in Beijing, they supported Zeng Zhaolun in excluding Wu Han; in the Southwest, they supported Pan Dakui and others against Chu Tunan. Luo Longji admitted that he had plans to expand the "invisible organization" nationwide. However, Luo Longji still did not talk about the activities of his small clique after 1952, only admitting that he maintained close contact with the people in the small clique after 1953, and restored individual friendships with these people after 1955. Luo Longji also confessed to his relationship with Li Zongren. He admitted that he hoped Li Zongren would be elected as the pseudo-vice president, believing that Li Zongren would pursue Anglo-American democracy and take the third road after coming to power. Luo Longji also confessed that in 1934, introduced by Hu Shi, he met Chiang Kai-shek at Mount Emei, lived with Chiang for a month, and lectured Chiang Kai-shek on the Anglo-American administrative institutions during World War I every afternoon. However, Luo Longji still refused to confess important facts in his confession and even tried to whitewash himself.

After Luo Longji's confession, Qian Jiaju and others severely refuted him. Qian Jiaju accused Luo Longji of not only failing to confess important facts, but also denying what he had confessed in the past, and even disguising himself as a "hero" and "fighter" against Japan and communism. Qian Jiaju listed many facts, including Luo Longji's own reactionary articles, thoroughly exposing Luo Longji's shameless lies.

Luo Longji Still Does Not Admit That the Purpose of His Organizing a Reactionary Group Was to Oppose Communism, the People, and Socialism, and Repeatedly Declares That After 1952, Even This "Invisible Organization" No Longer Existed. At this meeting, people from Luo Longji's anti-Communist clique and those who had been used by him, such as Zhao Wenbi, Zeng Zhaolun, Huang Daneng, and Zhang Qiaose, stood up as participants and those who had been used to testify to the conspiracies of Luo Longji's reactionary group.

Luo Longji Personally Summarized and Promoted the Experience of Seizing Leadership of the China Democratic League in Shanghai

In 1951, Zhao Wenbi, according to Luo Longji's instructions, summarized the "experience" of their small clique in seizing the leadership of the China Democratic League in Shanghai, and introduced it at the meeting of the Luo Longji reactionary group in Beijing. Zhao Wenbi confessed to this issue in detail at this meeting. This "experience" included four major items and more than twenty articles, including theoretical foundations, strategies, methods, and precautions. This "experience" proposed that it is necessary to obtain strongholds to establish a foundation, to cultivate cadres and organize a core; to be good at creating problems to win over the masses and expose the bureaucracy of the League's leadership; this "experience" also proposed that internally, one should pay attention to "unity" and mutual assistance, and adopt various forms to strengthen contact and increase understanding; externally, one should openly fight and secretly win over, seize by skill and force, and strike first, and also be good at winning over the "opposition," turning negativity into positivity, and gradually turning opponents into friends. The generals of the Luo Longji clique in Shanghai controlled two-thirds of the district branches of the Shanghai League organization based on this "experience." Luo Longji was extremely satisfied with this "experience" and successively introduced Pan Dakui from Sichuan, Li Dejia from Yunnan, Fan Guang from Nanjing, Jiang Zhenzhong from Zhejiang, and others to Shanghai to learn. When Zhao Wenbi introduced the "experience" in Beijing, Luo Longji asked Luo Hanxian to record it in detail in order to promote it nationwide, and decided to implement it first in Beijing. Afterwards, he sent his henchmen Luo Zimei and Huang Junmin (both of whom were secret agents) in the Central Committee of the China Democratic League to Shanghai to learn the "experience."

In Order to Seize the Leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, Luo Longji Personally Went Into Battle

Huang Daneng and Zhang Qiaose detailed the shameless acts of Luo Longji in using them to compete for the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Democratic League organization. According to Huang Daneng's exposure, in 1950 and 1951, Luo Longji repeatedly gathered Zhang Dongsun, Zeng Zhaolun, Pan Guangdan, Ye Duyi, Chen Xingui, Pu Xixiu, Luo Hanxian, Zhang Qiaose, and Huang Daneng, etc., in the name of eating and holding symposiums, to conspire to seize the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League. Luo Longji wanted to exclude Wu Han, put Zeng Zhaolun, the core figure of the small clique, in the leading position of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, and nominate Chen Xingui, Pan Guangdan, Pu Xixiu, Zhang Qiaose, and Huang Daneng as candidates for the Municipal Committee. In July 1951, Luo Longji's conspiracy to seize the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee failed, and he gathered this group of people together again to discuss "countermeasures." Luo Longji and Zhang Dongsun strongly advocated lodging complaints to the headquarters of the China Democratic League and the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, falsely accusing the Beijing Municipal Committee of manipulating and controlling the election. He pointed to Zhang Qiaose and Huang Daneng and said: "With Zhang Biao Lao (Zhang Lan) and Huang Ren Lao (Huang Yanpei)'s sons coming forward, they will definitely buy it." He instructed Zhang and Huang in person to write two copies of the accusation letter, one to be handed over to Zhang Lan, and the other to be deliberately handed over to Luo Longji himself, stating that he was entrusted to consider whether to hand it over to the United Front Work Department. After the letter was written, Luo Longji thought it was too weak and powerless, so he personally drafted the "accusation" letter in place of Zhang and Huang. After drafting, he handed it over to Zhang and Huang to copy and sign, and he himself took back the original letter. Zhang Qiaose also revealed that Luo Longji shamelessly asked Zhang Qiaose to intercede for Luo in front of his father Zhang Lan, asking Zhang Lan to consider their shared hardships, treat Luo as a confidant, and support him in vying for rights and status.

Since 1952, This Small Clique Has Been Frequently Exchanging Secret Letters

Zeng Zhaolun also used his personal participation in activities to prove that after 1952, Luo Longji's anti-Communist group did not stop its activities. In 1952, the Central Committee of the China Democratic League reorganized its institutions, and Zeng Zhaolun served as the deputy director of the Organization Committee. Luo Longji also insisted on arranging for Luo Hanxian to serve as a member, attempting to control the organizational work of the China Democratic League through these two people. In April and May 1953, Zeng Zhaolun went to East China. Zeng was entrusted by Luo Longji to bring many messages to people in the small clique. In Shanghai, Zeng Zhaolun told Zhao Wenbi, Peng Wenying, and Chen Renbing that Luo Longji wanted them to strengthen unity; he went to Nanjing to find Chen Minzhi, telling him that Luo Longji was willing to support him as the director of the League organization when Jiangsu Province was established in the future; he met Chen Bisheng in Fuzhou, telling him that Luo Longji wanted him to work hard on League affairs; at the same time, Luo Longji also wanted him to support Chen Yangzhi in Qingdao and Jiang Zhenzhong in Zhejiang. Luo Longji's lies that he had not sent anyone, written letters, or brought messages to his anti-Communist small clique in these years have now been completely bankrupt.

Luo Longji Always Said That the Purpose of His "Invisible Organization" Was to Deal With Zhang Bojun. Li Wenyi Has Already Analyzed the Large Number of Facts Revealed and the Secret Letters Between the Luo Longji Group. She Pointed Out That the Strategic Goal of the Luo Longji Anti-Communist Group Was to Seize the Real Power of Leadership of the China Democratic League and Use the Legal Status of the China Democratic League to Serve Their Anti-Communist and Anti-Socialist Political Ambitions. Before liberation, he regarded the China Democratic League as the political capital to realize the "middle route" (that is, opposing carrying out the revolution to the end under the leadership of the Communist Party); after liberation, he wanted to make the China Democratic League "compete on an equal footing" with the Communist Party, that is, opposing carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction under the leadership of the Communist Party. The only difference is the different modes of activity. Li Wenyi revealed the two-faced tactics of Luo Longji's anti-Communist activities: do not trust the Communist Party, but try to gain the Communist Party's trust in them. In his secret letter to his cronies, he pointed out: "Thoroughly contact the friendly party (referring to the CCP) to obtain understanding," but "do not blindly obey, let alone please privately, so as to disrupt the steps and break up unity." He also said: "... It is not unconditional obedience (referring to the United Front Work Department) in order to gain an official position in the government. If this point is not understood, we will lose the whole game." Luo Longji's two-faced tactics also included: using anyone, but keeping a hand on anyone. There were many considerations for the circulation range of his secret letters. Some were only for the recipient to read, some were only for a few key members to read; some could only be circulated face-to-face, and some could be circulated freely. Li Wenyi said that the mode of conspiracy activities of the Luo Longji group was hidden and dispersed. It is now difficult to publicly carry out anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist activities. Li Wenyi pointed out that their modes of activity include the following: writing secret letters, sending liaison officers to convey intentions; making friends through literature, inviting small groups and targets outside the League to discuss domestic and foreign affairs to expand reactionary influence; local key members reporting and asking for instructions in Beijing; introducing and exchanging experiences in conspiracy activities.

Sa Kongliao's speech quoted a large number of secret letters between Luo Longji and Zhao Wenbi, Peng Wenying, Pan Dakui, and others, irrefutably proving that the spearhead of Luo Longji's anti-Communist group was directed at the Party and the people. (The speech is published in another article.)

The Figures in This Reactionary Group Are Mostly Old-Brand Rightists

Hu Yuzhi also made a speech on the issue of the Luo Longji reactionary group. He thoroughly revealed the reactionary nature of this group from the members of the Luo Longji reactionary group and what activities this group engaged in. Luo Longji confessed that "almost all the people who participated in his so-called 'invisible organization' have become rightists today, which is due to the ideological backwardness of each person." Hu Yuzhi said: This is completely sophistry. In fact, most of these people are old-brand rightists, that is, some people among the bourgeois intellectuals who have long and firmly opposed communism and socialism. Among them are comprador politicians who have close ties with American imperialism, remnants of warlords and bureaucrats in the Kuomintang reactionary regime, senior intellectuals cultivated by Anglo-American slavish education, American and Chiang secret agents, and political degenerates. Their common characteristics are: attempting to abolish the Party's leadership in their own fields, hating progressive elements, unwilling to take the socialist road, nostalgic for the life of the exploiting class, and having varying degrees of anti-Soviet and pro-American sentiments. What other purpose could this conspiracy group composed of these anti-Soviet and anti-Communist old-brand rightists have besides opposing communism, the people, and socialism? Their activities have also proved this point. Their activities are nothing more than: excluding and attacking Communist Party members and progressive elements; getting rightists and politically suspicious backward elements into organs and schools; inciting intellectuals to be dissatisfied with the Party, opposing ideological reform, and opposing the Party's leadership over cultural, educational, and scientific undertakings; controlling newspapers and other publishing organs to spread bourgeois political and academic ideas, disseminating pro-American and anti-Soviet fallacies, and provoking the unity of the socialist camp and the peace camp, until the frantic attack on the Party during the "blooming and contending" period. Therefore, Hu Yuzhi pointed out that the Luo Longji conspiracy group completely violated the six political standards instructed by Chairman Mao, which are absolutely not allowed within the people's democratic united front and are enemies of the people.

Luo Longji's secretary Shao Ciyun made a detailed exposure of Luo Longji's conspiracy activities since his return to China. (The speech is published in another article.)

Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji Colluded Long Ago on the Point of Anti-Communism and Anti-People

Although Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun had sectarian disputes over the struggle for power and profit, they had colluded long before this Zhang-Luo alliance on the point of anti-communism and anti-people. Luo Ziwei and Luo Hanxian revealed in a joint speech that Zhang and Luo colluded with each other to oppose the Third Plenary Session of the China Democratic League (this meeting determined the policy of the China Democratic League following the Communist Party). At that time, Zhang Bojun was in Hong Kong and Luo Longji was in Shanghai. Luo Ziwei and Luo Hanxian also stayed in Hong Kong and Shanghai respectively. The correspondence between Luo Ziwei and Luo Hanxian was one of the ways of contact between the rightists headed by Zhang Bojun in Hong Kong and Luo Longji in Shanghai. The correspondence between Luo Ziwei and Luo Hanxian started around March and April 1948 and continued until the beginning of 1949. All the letters were shown to Luo Longji. In these communications, they reported to Luo Longji on the movements of rightists such as Zhang Bojun in Hong Kong and supported Luo Longji's reactionary activities in China. They told Luo Longji that the opinions within the League were very inconsistent after the Third Plenary Session, and the rightists headed by Zhang Bojun believed that the China Democratic League should still play a "middle" role. They also encouraged Luo Longji, saying that the "democratic movement" should rely on the mainland, and Hong Kong's corner was not very effective with democratic people floating on the upper level. They wanted Luo Longji to actively work hard in China, continue to engage in middle-of-the-road activities, and grasp the work of the local organizations of the China Democratic League. While Luo Ziwei and Luo Hanxian were contacting Zhang and Luo, Zhang Bojun also sent Lu Guangsheng to Nanjing and Shanghai to inquire about the situation. When Lu arrived in Shanghai, he met Luo Longji. When he reported to Zhang Bojun after returning to Hong Kong, he said that Luo Longji believed that the situation was very difficult, but he could still work hard to open up the situation, and Hong Kong and Shanghai could work separately. Ye Duyi also revealed that Luo Longji met with the American Consul General in Guangzhou, Laden, in Shanghai in May and June 1948. Before Laden arrived in Shanghai, he had met with Zhang Bojun in Hong Kong. Zhang Bojun expressed to him that he opposed the resolution of the Third Plenary Session and asked Laden to tell Luo Longji when he passed by Shanghai. Later, Zhang Bojun's wife, Li Jiansheng, went from Hong Kong to Shanghai, and also went to Zhang Lan and Luo Longji, conveying Zhang Bojun's opposition to the Third Plenary Session and confirming that Zhang Bojun had met Laden in Hong Kong.

Luo Longji Said in His Letter to Pu Xixiu: "...Wang Mang Gained the Throne Without Spending a Single Soldier"

Pu Xixiu read aloud a passage from a letter from Luo Longji to her at this meeting: "You don't think that you can't force the palace without guns and bullets. The complex situation can be infinitely changed. If you have read history, you will know that Wang Mang gained the throne without spending a single soldier. He didn't have a single soldier in his hand either. When the situation of disintegration has been formed, when the rebels shout, the world will respond." This letter talked about his support for Li Zongren's candidacy for the pseudo-vice president, but comparing these words with the flat redress committee proposed by Luo Longji this time, and the wildfire he ignited among intellectuals, it is very clear that Luo Longji wanted to be Wang Mang, and Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun both had the "courage" to "clean up the mess, who else but me." He thought that the "situation of disintegration has been formed," as long as their "rebels shout," the "world will respond," and they can usurp the Party's leadership without spending a single soldier.

Wu Maosun and Xu Boxin also spoke at this meeting. Wu Maosun revealed the fact that Luo Longji used the foreign affairs group of the first CPPCC and the international issue group of the second CPPCC as strongholds, and tried his best to expand the powers of these organizations in an attempt to usurp the leadership of international activities. Xu Boxin revealed Luo Longji's conspiracy to suggest that the CPPCC establish a "Committee on Issues of Senior Intellectuals." Finally, the chairman pointed out that Luo Longji's confession is regressing one time after another, and what he confessed last time is overturned the next time. He demanded that Luo Longji make a comprehensive confession and review of his anti-Communist and anti-people crimes within a certain period of time.

    解放以来的事实证明
    罗隆基的反动活动并未停止
    本报讯  8月30日下午、31日下午民盟中央举行第九次整风座谈会。在这次座谈会上李文宜、萨空了以及罗隆基反共集团的成员赵文璧、曾昭抡等揭发出大量事实（包括罗隆基的大批密信），再次证明这个集团一贯进行反共、反人民、反社会主义的阴谋活动，而且，这种活动在1952年以后并没有停止，只是采取了更加隐蔽的方式而已。
    罗隆基承认他有扩展“无形组织”的计划，但不谈1952年以后的活动
    罗隆基在这次会上交代了一点他的反动集团在1952年以前的活动情况。他承认他同张东荪结成了小集团。这个小集团的目的是夺取民盟的领导权。罗隆基说他在抗日战争胜利前就有了搞“无形组织”的动机，日本投降后就有所活动。解放后，周鲸文、叶笃义、潘光旦、曾昭抡、刘王立明、范朴斋、张志和、罗涵先等有的没有得到安插，有的自认为安排不当，经常有怨言。罗隆基就“打算团结这一批人在盟内成一个力量”。他同张东荪商量，张同意了。这就开始了北京盟内的“无形组织”。罗隆基承认，他的小集团的人物曾经同各地盟内的进步力量展开了一系列的斗争。在上海支持彭文应同史良斗争；在北京支持曾昭抡排斥吴晗；在西南支持潘大逵等反对楚图南。罗隆基承认他有在全国扩展“无形组织”的计划。但是，罗隆基仍然不谈他的小集团在1952年以后的活动，只承认1953年后同小集团中的人物仍保持着密切往来，1955年后同这些人恢复个别的朋友往返。罗隆基还交代了他同李宗仁的关系。他承认他希望李宗仁当选为伪副总统，认为李宗仁上台后会搞英美民主走第三条路线。罗隆基还交代了在1934年，由胡适介绍，他曾到峨嵋山同蒋介石见过面，在蒋处住了一个月，每天下午给蒋介石讲第一次世界大战时的英美行政机构。但是罗隆基在交代中仍旧不肯交代重要的事实，甚至替自己抹粉。
    罗隆基交代后，千家驹等对他提出了严厉的驳斥，千家驹斥责罗隆基不但不交代重要的事实，反而把过去已经交代的东西都赖掉，甚至把自己装扮成抗日联共的“英雄”和“战士”。千家驹列举许多事实包括罗隆基自己写的反动文章，彻底揭穿了罗隆基的这些无耻谎言。
    罗隆基至今不承认他组织反动集团的目的是反共反人民反社会主义，而且一再声明1952年以后，连这个“无形组织”也不存在了。这次会议上，罗隆基反共小集团中的人以及被他利用过的人赵文璧、曾昭抡、黄大能、张乔啬等，都以参加者和被利用者的身份站出来为罗隆基反动集团的阴谋活动作证。
    罗隆基曾亲自总结推广上海夺取民盟领导权经验
    1951年，赵文璧曾经根据罗隆基的指示，总结了他们的小集团在上海夺取民盟领导权的“经验”，并且在北京罗隆基反动集团的会议上作了介绍。赵文璧在这次会议上详细地交代了这个问题。这个“经验”包括四大项二十几条，有理论基础、有策略、有方法以及注意事项。这个“经验”提出，要取得据点以建立基础，要培植干部组织核心；要善于制造问题借此笼络群众，暴露盟的领导上的官僚主义；这个“经验”还提出，对内部要讲究“团结”、互助，要采取多种形式加强联系增加了解；对外则明打暗拉、巧取豪夺，先发制人等，还要善于争取“反对派”，化消极为积极，使反对者逐渐成为朋友。罗隆基小集团在上海的大将们就是根据这个“经验”控制了上海盟组织三分之二的区分部。罗隆基对这个“经验”极为满意，曾先后介绍四川的潘大逵、云南的李德家、南京的樊光、浙江的姜震中等到上海去学习。当赵文璧在北京介绍“经验”时，罗隆基让罗涵先详细记录，以便在全国推广，并且决定首先在北京试行。事后，他还派他在民盟中央的喽啰罗自梅和黄俊民（这两人都是特务分子）到上海去学习“经验”。
    为夺取民盟北京市委领导权，罗隆基亲自出马上阵
    黄大能和张乔啬详细地揭发了罗隆基利用他们争夺北京市民盟组织领导权的无耻勾当。据黄大能揭发，1950和1951年，罗隆基曾多次用吃饭、座谈会的名义，纠集张东荪、曾昭抡、潘光旦、叶笃义、陈新桂、浦熙修、罗涵先、张乔啬和黄大能等，阴谋夺取民盟北京市委的领导权。罗隆基要排挤吴晗，把小集团的核心人物曾昭抡提在民盟北京市委的领导地位，把陈新桂、潘光旦、浦熙修、张乔啬和黄大能都提名为市委候选人。1951年7月，罗隆基夺取北京市委领导权的阴谋失败了，他又把这一伙人找到一起，商讨“对策”。罗隆基和张东荪竭力主张向民盟总部和中共中央统战部告状，诬蔑北京盟市委操纵把持选举，他指着张乔啬和黄大能说：“有张表老（张澜）和黄任老（黄炎培）的儿子出面，他们就一定要买账”。他当面授意张、黄二人写一式两份控告信，一份要交张澜，另一份故意让交给罗隆基自己，写明委托他考虑是否交给统战部。信写好了，罗隆基认为太软弱无力，于是，他亲自动手代替张、黄二人起草“控告”信。起草后交张、黄抄写签名，他自己则把原信收回。张乔啬还揭露，罗隆基竟然恬不知耻地要张乔啬在他父亲张澜面前为罗说项，要张澜念共患难之情，把罗当做心腹，支持他争夺权利地位。
    1952年以来这个小集团密信往还活动频仍
    曾昭抡也用他亲身参加的活动证明1952年以后，罗隆基的反共集团并没有停止活动。1952年民盟中央机构改组，曾昭抡担任组织委员会的副主任，罗隆基还一定要安排罗涵先去担任委员，企图通过这两个人控制民盟的组织工作。1953年4、5月间曾昭抡到华东去，曾受罗隆基的委托，给小集团中的人带了许多口信。在上海，曾昭抡转告赵文璧、彭文应、陈仁炳，罗隆基要他们加强团结；到南京找过陈敏之，告诉他将来建立江苏省的盟组织时，罗隆基愿支持他当主任委员；在福州见了陈碧笙，告诉他罗隆基要他努力搞盟务；同时罗隆基还要他到青岛支持陈仰之，在浙江支持姜震中。罗隆基的所谓这几年没有派过人、没有写过信或带过口信给他的反共小集团的谎言，至此已完全破产。
    罗隆基总说，他搞“无形组织”的目的是对付章伯钧。李文宜就已经揭发出的大量事实和罗隆基集团之间的密信进行了分析。她指出，罗隆基反共集团的战略目的是夺取民盟的领导实权，利用民盟的合法地位，为他们的反共反社会主义政治野心服务。在解放前他把民盟作为实现“中间路线”（即反对在共产党领导下把革命进行到底）的政治资本；在解放后是要使民盟同共产党“分庭抗礼”，也就是反对在共产党领导下进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设。区别仅只在于活动方式不同。李文宜揭露了罗隆基反共活动的两面派手法：不要信任共产党，但要骗取共产党对他们的信任。他给他的党羽的密信中曾指出：“与友党（指中共）彻底联系取得谅解”，但是“不要盲目服从，更不要私自讨好，以自乱步骤，拆散团结”。又说：“……不是无条件驯服（指对统战部），以求在政府中占得一官半职。此点若不明白，我们全局输了。”罗隆基的两面手法还有：要利用任何人，但对任何人都要留一手。他的密信的传阅范围就有很多讲究，有的只给收信人自己看，有的只给少数骨干看；有的只能当面传阅，有的则可自由传阅。李文宜说罗隆基集团的阴谋活动方式，是隐蔽的、分散的。现在要公开进行反共、反人民、反社会主义的活动是困难的。李文宜指出他们的活动方式有以下几种：写密信，派联络员传达意图；以文会友，约小集团和盟外的对象，议论国内外大事，扩大反动影响；地方骨干分子来京汇报和请示；介绍和交流阴谋活动经验。
    萨空了的发言引用了罗隆基和赵文璧、彭文应、潘大逵等之间来往的大量密信，无可辩驳地证明罗隆基的反共集团的矛头是指向党和人民。（发言见另文）
    这个反动集团的人物，大都是老牌右派分子
    胡愈之也就罗隆基反动集团问题作了发言。他从罗隆基反动集团的成员是那些人和这个集团搞了些什么活动，彻底地揭露了这个集团的反动性。罗隆基交代说“参加他的所谓‘无形组织’的一批人到了今天差不多都成了右派分子，这是各人思想落后的缘故”。胡愈之说：这完全是狡辩。实际上，这些人绝大部分都是老牌右派分子，也就是资产阶级知识分子中间长期地坚决地反共、反社会主义的一些人。其中有同美帝国主义有紧密联系的买办政客、有国民党反动政权中的军阀官僚残余、有英美奴化教育培养出来的高级知识分子、有美蒋特务分子和政治上的蜕化分子。他们共同的特点是：在自己的领域内企图取消党的领导，仇视进步分子，不愿走社会主义道路，留恋剥削阶级生活，具有程度不同的反苏亲美情绪等。由这些反苏反共的老牌右派分子组成的阴谋集团，除了反共、反人民、反社会主义，难道还会有别的什么目的？他们的活动也证明了这一点。他们的活动无非是：排斥和打击共产党员和进步分子；把右派分子和政治上可疑的落后分子打进机关学校；煽动知识分子对党不满，反对思想改造，反对党对文教科学事业的领导；控制报刊和其他出版机关传播资产阶级政治和学术思想，散布亲美反苏谬论，挑拨社会主义阵营和平阵营的团结等，一直到“鸣放”期间对党的猖狂进攻。因此，胡愈之指出，罗隆基阴谋集团，是完全违反毛主席所指示的六项政治标准的，是人民民主统一战线内部所决不容许的，是与人民为敌的。
    罗隆基的秘书邵慈云对罗隆基这次回国以后的阴谋活动作了详尽的揭发。（发言见另文）
    在反共反人民这一点上，章罗很早就勾搭上了
    罗隆基和章伯钧尽管为争权夺利闹过宗派纠纷，但是在反共反人民这一点上，却早在这次章罗联盟之前，就勾勾搭搭。罗子为和罗涵先在联合发言中揭露章罗二人互相勾结反对民盟三中全会（这次会议确定了民盟跟着共产党走的一边倒的方针）。当时章伯钧在香港、罗隆基在上海。罗子为和罗涵先两人也分别留在香港和上海。罗子为和罗涵先之间的通信，就是在香港的以章伯钧为首的右派分子和在上海的罗隆基之间的联系方式之一。罗子为和罗涵先之间的通信从1948年3、4月间开始，一直继续到1949年初，所有的信件都交给罗隆基看过。在这些通信中，他们曾经向罗隆基报告香港章伯钧等右派分子的动向，并且给罗隆基在国内的反动活动撑腰打气。他们告诉罗隆基说，三中全会以后盟内意见很不一致，以章伯钧为首的右派分子认为民盟仍然应该起“中间”作用。他们还鼓励罗隆基说，“民主运动”要依靠国内，香港一隅，民主人士浮在上层，作用不大。他们要罗隆基在国内积极努力，继续搞中间路线活动，要罗隆基抓紧民盟地方组织的工作。在罗子为和罗涵先从中为章罗二人联系的同时，章伯钧还曾派卢广声到南京、上海探听情况。卢到上海时见过罗隆基，回港后向章伯钧汇报时说，罗隆基认为时局十分困难，但仍可努力打开局面，港沪两地可以分头努力。叶笃义也揭露，在1948年5、6月间，罗隆基和美国驻广州总领事拉登在上海会过面。拉登到上海前曾在香港和章伯钧会过面。章伯钧向他表示他是反对三中全会决议的，并托拉登过上海时转告给罗隆基。以后，章伯钧的妻子李健生从香港到上海，也曾去找过张澜和罗隆基，转达了章伯钧反对三中全会的意见，并且证实章伯钧在港和拉登会过面。
    罗隆基给浦熙修的信上说：“……王莽取得帝位，并未费一兵一卒”
    浦熙修在这次会上宣读了罗隆基给她的一封信中的一段：“你不要以为无枪无弹就不能逼宫，错综复杂之势，可变化无穷。假使你读过历史，就知道王莽取得帝位，并未费一兵一卒。他手中亦无一兵一卒。到了瓦解之势已成，乱者一呼，天下四应。”这封信讲的是他支持李宗仁竞选伪副总统的事，可是把这些话和这一次罗隆基提出的平反委员会，以及他在知识分子中点起的一把野火等对照起来看，罗隆基想做王莽，罗隆基和章伯钧同样有着“收拾残局，舍我其谁”的“气概”就十分清楚了，他以为现在是“瓦解之势已成”，只要他们这些“乱者一呼”，就会“天下四应”，他们就可以不费一兵一卒而篡夺党的领导权了。
    在这次会上发言的还有吴茂荪和徐伯昕。吴茂荪揭露罗隆基利用第一届政协的外交组和第二届政协的国际问题组为据点，竭力设法扩大这些组织的职权，企图篡夺国际活动领导权的事实。徐伯昕揭露罗隆基建议政协设立“高级知识分子问题委员会”的阴谋。最后，主席指出，罗隆基的交代一次比一次倒退，上一次交代了的，下一次又推翻。要求罗隆基在一定期限内对自己的反共反人民罪行作出全面的交代和检讨。
