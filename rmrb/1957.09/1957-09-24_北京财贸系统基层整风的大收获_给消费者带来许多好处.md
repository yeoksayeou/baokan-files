Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd: The rectification movement in Beijing's finance and trade system has been deeply carried out to the grassroots units. The first batch of more than 60,000 workers and staff have been put into the rectification and socialist ideological education movement.

According to preliminary statistics, these district-level and grassroots workers and staff have posted nearly 40,000 big-character posters, putting forward more than 200,000 opinions. More than 70% of them are criticisms and suggestions regarding business management, bloated organizations, overstaffing, and leadership style. The vast majority of these opinions are correct and will be of great benefit to improving work. Fang Sh茂, a worker at the Quanjugui Department Store, posted a big-character poster titled "Traveling Around the Country," criticizing the phenomenon of purchasing goods from other places that could be purchased in the city, resulting in stockpiling and waste. Some workers criticized certain units for treating second-class products as first-class products, and mixing inferior coal with good coal and pricing it as good coal, reflecting capitalist business practices.

Leading cadres of various units attach great importance to the opinions put forward by the masses and have begun to seize the problem and improve their work. The Chongwen District Department Store put forward more than 3,000 opinions, and by the 14th, more than 280 had been resolved. Among the problems that have been solved, a considerable part has brought great benefits to consumers after being solved. For example, the receipts issued by the Wangfujing Department Store in the past did not have the "Cash Received" stamp, so many unit purchasers could not be reimbursed after returning, and they had to go to the department store again to complete the stamping procedures, which delayed a lot of time; now, it has been stipulated that all receipts must be stamped.

In the rectification, the vast majority of workers and staff have achieved "rectification and production without any delay." (Attached picture)

    北京财贸系统基层整风的大收获
    给消费者带来许多好处
    据新华社23日讯  北京市财贸系统整风运动已深入开展到基层单位。第一批投入整风和社会主义思想教育运动的职工有六万多人。
    据初步统计，这些区级和基层的职工共贴出大字报近四万张，提出意见达二十多万条。其中70％以上是对于经营管理、机构臃肿、人浮于事以及领导作风方面的批评和建议。这些意见绝大多数是正确的，对改进工作将有很大的好处。劝业场商场的职工房树茂以“周游全国”为题贴出大字报，批评了能够从本市采购的商品，却从外埠进货，造成积压浪费的现象。有些职工批评了某些单位把二等品当一等品，在好煤中掺次煤而按好煤计价等资本主义经营作风。
    各单位的领导干部都很重视群众提出的意见，并且已经开始抓紧解决问题，改进工作。崇文区百货门市部职工提出了三千多条意见，到14日止，已经解决了二百八十多条。在已解决的问题中，有相当一部分在解决后给消费者带来了很大的好处。如王府井百货商店过去开出的发票上都没有加盖“现金收讫”章，以致很多单位的采购员回去后不能报销，只得重去百货商店完成盖章手续，来回往返，耽误很多时间；现在，已经规定一律盖章。
    在整风中，绝大多数职工都做到了“整风、生产两不误”。（附图片）
