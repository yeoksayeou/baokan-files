Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: The anti-Rightist struggle in local judicial and administrative organs and trial organs has achieved initial victories. A group of Rightist elements and Rightist cliques have been exposed in the judicial bureaus and people's courts of various provinces and cities. The sinister conspiracy of the Rightist elements to seize leadership over judicial work and seize the weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship has been thoroughly exposed.

Many Rightist elements in judicial organs are connected to the Zhang-Luo alliance, and some are core members of Luo Longji's Rightist clique. Jiang Zhenzhong, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Justice, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, and a Rightist element, is a member of the Luo Longji clique. He Gonggan, Director of the Fujian Provincial Department of Justice, member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, and Vice-Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Committee, exposed in Fujian Province, is a stronghold of the Zhang-Luo alliance in Fujian. He Gonggan deeply resented the people's democratic dictatorship. He not only openly disseminated the reactionary political proposition of so-called "democracy for all," but also used his position as Director of the Department of Justice to harbor counter-revolutionaries. The Sichuan Provincial Department of Justice exposed an anti-Communist clique headed by Zhang Xueyan, Deputy Director of the Department of Justice, member of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, and a Rightist element. Zhang Xueyan was a member of Pan Dakui's clique in the Zhang-Luo alliance. He cultivated confidants in the Department of Justice and actively wooed a group of people who were dissatisfied with the Party, inciting trouble among the masses during the rectification campaign. You Kebin, one of the members of this anti-Communist clique, attempted to change the nature and task of the people's courts. He proposed with ulterior motives: "The domestic class struggle has ended, and the main task now is to handle contradictions among the people. The court is no longer a tool of dictatorship." At the same time, he believed that the situation had changed and that court cadres should also "change shifts." The anti-Communist clique headed by Lou Bangyan, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice and a Rightist element, exposed by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice, has close ties with the anti-Communist group headed by Qian Duansheng, including Lou Bangyan and Wang Tieya, under the leadership of the Zhang-Luo alliance.

The Shanghai judicial system exposed a Rightist clique headed by He Jixiang, Presiding Judge of the Civil Division of the Second Intermediate People's Court and Deputy Director of the Work Committee of the China Democratic League, including Liu Heping, Zhang Zhong, Long Zhenzhong, and Li Guoji. As soon as the rectification campaign began, He Jixiang, under the instruction and support of Shen Zhiyuan, Chen Renbing, and Sun Siming, became a "fire brigade" – the "Judicial Work Group of the China Democratic League" – of the Rightist group of the China Democratic League Municipal Committee in the judicial department, actively carrying out anti-Communist activities. During the great blooming and contending, they attacked judicial work in a big way, saying that judicial reform was "sweeping old judicial personnel out the door," that the people's legal system was "without laws to follow, laws are not followed, and laws are followed arbitrarily," and they also cursed the people's assessors for "enforcing the law and making the law, they are simply becoming kings."

Among the Rightist elements exposed in the judicial organs of various places are those from outside the Party and those from within the Party. Anhui Province exposed the anti-Party words and deeds of Chen Rengang, Deputy Director of the Department of Justice and Secretary of the Party Group. This Rightist element within the Party consistently disobeyed organizational decisions and opposed the leadership of the Party. He deliberately fabricated the fallacy that "there are no bad elements in society" and wanted to show benevolence to counter-revolutionaries. After the rectification campaign began, Chen Rengang colluded with Li Xiangruo, Director of the Anhui Provincial Department of Justice, a Rightist element outside the Party who had always been dissatisfied with the Party, and attacked the Party from the inside out. Ding Yangxuan, Deputy Director of the Trial Organs Management Division, a Rightist element within the Party, exposed by the Shanxi Provincial Department of Justice, viciously attacked the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries campaign. Li Yu, Presiding Judge of the Criminal Division of the Lanzhou Intermediate People's Court in Gansu Province and a Rightist element within the Party, believed that the reactionary slogans of counter-revolutionary elements were "slips of the pen" when trying counter-revolutionary cases, and said that the special agents sent back by Taiwan "showed preliminary awareness by returning to the mainland," intentionally condoning the enemy.

In addition, some Rightist elements have also been exposed by lawyers' organizations in various places. Many of them were originally old lawyers who had not been reformed at all. They did not protect the legitimate rights and interests of the parties in accordance with the law, but consciously exonerated counter-revolutionary elements from their crimes. Among them are Wu Tong, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the Anhui Provincial Lawyers Association, Zhang Shen, lawyer of the Kunming Legal Advisory Office and member of the Jiusan Society, and Yang Tenggao, trainee lawyer of the Urumqi Legal Advisory Office.

After serious reasoning and struggle, some of the exposed Rightist elements have begun to bow their heads and confess their guilt to the people, while others are still stubbornly resisting. The anti-Rightist struggle in judicial organs in various places is being carried out extensively and deeply, and is being gradually rolled out in a planned way to judicial organs at all levels below the provincial level.

　　全国司法界反右派斗争初获胜利
    右派妄图夺取人民民主专政武器的阴谋破产
    据新华社18日讯　各地司法行政机关和审判机关的反右派斗争，已获得初步胜利。在各省、市司法厅、局和人民法院里揭发出一批右派分子和右派小集团。右派分子妄图夺取司法工作领导权夺取人民民主专政的武器的罪恶阴谋，已被彻底揭露。
    司法机关中的许多右派分子，同章罗联盟是有联系的，有的是罗隆基右派集团的骨干分子。浙江省司法厅厅长、民盟浙江省委主任委员、右派分子姜震中，就是罗隆基小集团的成员之一。福建省揭露出的省司法厅厅长、民盟中央委员兼福建省委副主任委员、右派分子何公敢，是章罗联盟在福建的据点。何公敢对人民民主专政深恶痛绝，他不仅公然散布所谓“全民民主”的反动政治主张，而且还利用司法厅长的身分包庇反革命。四川省司法厅揭露出以司法厅副厅长、民盟四川省委委员、右派分子张雪岩为首的反共小集团。张雪岩是章罗联盟中潘大逵小集团的成员之一。他在司法厅内培植心腹，积极拉拢一批对党不满的分子，整风时在群众中点火。这个反共小集团的成员之一游克斌企图改变人民法院的性质和任务，他心怀叵测地提出：“国内阶级斗争已经结束，现在主要是处理人民内部矛盾，法院已不是专政的工具。”同时他认为形势变了，法院干部也应该“换班”。北京市司法局揭露出的以司法局副局长、右派分子楼邦彦为首的反共小集团，与章罗联盟领导下的以钱端升为首的包括楼邦彦、王铁崖在内的反共集团有密切的联系。
    上海市司法界揭发了以第二中级人民法院民事审判庭庭长、民盟机关工作委员会副主任委员何济翔为首的包括刘和平、张中、龙缜中、李国机等人的右派小集团。整风一开始，何济翔即在沈志远、陈仁炳、孙斯鸣的授意和支持下，成了一支民盟市委右派集团在司法部门的“放火队”——“民盟司法工作组”，积极进行反共活动。在大鸣大放中，他们对司法工作大肆攻击。说司法改革是“对旧司法人员扫地出门”、说人民法制是“无法可依，有法不依，有法乱依”，还咒骂人民审判员“既执法，又立法，简直是封王了”。
    在各地司法机关揭发出的右派分子中有党外的，也有党内的。安徽省揭发了司法厅副厅长、党组书记陈仁刚的反党言行。这个党内右派分子一贯违抗组织决定，反对党的领导。他有意制造“社会上没有坏分子”的谰言，并要对反革命施仁政。整风开始后，陈仁刚和党外的一贯对党不满的右派分子、安徽省司法厅厅长李湘若里应外合向党进攻。山西省司法厅揭露出的党内右派分子、审判机关管理处副处长丁仰轩，恶毒地攻击肃反运动。甘肃省兰州市中级人民法院刑庭庭长、党内右派分子李煜审理反革命案件时，认为反革命分子反动标语是“笔下之误”，对台湾派遣潜回的特务，说是“能回到大陆来，说明有初步觉悟”，有意放纵敌人。
    此外，各地律师组织也揭露出一些右派分子，他们中间不少原是旧律师出身的，根本没有改造，他们不是依照法律保护当事人的合法权益，而是有意识地为反革命分子开脱罪责。其中有安徽省律师协会筹委会秘书长吴桐，昆明市法律顾问处律师、九三学社成员张慎，乌鲁木齐市法律顾问处见习律师杨腾高。
    揭露出的这批右派分子，经过严肃的说理斗争，有些已经开始向人民低头认罪，有些尚在继续顽抗。各地司法机关的反右派斗争正在广泛深入地进行，并有计划地向省一级以下的各级司法机关逐步展开。
