Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 16th: Hubei Province has achieved tremendous success in industrial production and construction during the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, and the province's old, backward economic landscape is rapidly changing.

According to the latest information obtained by reporters from the Hubei Provincial Bureau of Statistics, the province's total industrial output value (excluding handicrafts) had already surpassed the planned level for 1957 stipulated by the state one year ahead of schedule, increasing by more than one and a half times compared to 1952. Industrial production increased by an average of 26.98% annually, exceeding the target of an annual increase of 18.4% in the Five-Year Plan. In the first half of this year, the province's total industrial output value exceeded the original plan by 4.16%.

Of the products listed in the central or provincial Five-Year Plan for Hubei Province, twenty products, including raw coal, pig iron, steel, steel products, cast iron pipes, internal combustion engines, electric motors, double-wheeled double-shared plows, civilian ships, ball bearings, freight cars, machine-made paper, cement, gypsum, and cotton yarn, reached the 1957 production level last year. In the first half of this year, products such as sulfuric acid and wood pulp also reached the Five-Year Plan level.

In recent years, the Hubei industrial system has trial-produced and manufactured hundreds of new products, including 800-grade high-grade cement, vibratory pile drivers, Daqiao brand windproof and rainproof matches, double-arm cranes, 3628-type hard alloy lathe grinders, 30-ton 勹11 insulated cars, hollow concrete electric poles, high-grade asbestos pressure pipes, regular deformation steel bars and high-grade alloy steel, high-quality spring steel, stainless heat-resistant steel, and various types of seeders, shellers, and sprayers. The quality of these products is good.

The rapid development of industry in Hubei Province has led to significant changes in the ratio between industry and agriculture and in the internal production structure of industry. The total industrial output value in the province's total industrial and agricultural output value has increased from 16.05% in 1952 to 27.8% in 1956. The means of production industry has also been given priority in industrial development, especially the machine-building industry, which is the core of heavy industry, has improved even faster, transforming from mainly engaging in repair work to a new type of industrial enterprise capable of producing products such as freight cars and metal cutting machine tools.

During the period of the first Five-Year Plan, Hubei Province had a large number of basic construction tasks. By the first half of this year, local basic construction investment had exceeded the Five-Year Plan by 5.8% ahead of schedule. Many capital construction units have been completed and put into operation successively in the past five years. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, which was an extremely difficult and complex project, was completed nearly two years ahead of the state plan. The Hanyang Sleeper Anti-Corrosion Plant, Wuhan Tianyi Printing and Dyeing Factory, and many other new industrial and mining enterprises that did not exist in Hubei Province in the past have also been completed and put into production. The commissioning of these newly built and expanded industrial sectors has greatly increased the proportion of total industrial output value in the national economy. According to the 1956 output value of only eighteen enterprises, such as the Hanyang Sleeper Anti-Corrosion Plant and the Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau (newly added capacity), it is equivalent to more than double the total modern industrial output value of the province in 1949. The vigorous development of industrial production and basic construction has rapidly changed the old urban landscape. The original commercial city of Wuhan has now become an industrial city with production as its main focus; Huangshi has become an emerging industrial city.

### 湖北省经济面貌大大改观  工业总产值提前一年超过第一个五年计划的水平

　　湖北省经济面貌大大改观
　　工业总产值提前一年超过第一个五年计划的水平
    据新华社武汉16日电　湖北省工业生产和建设事业在执行第一个五年计划中获得巨大成就，全省旧有的经济落后面貌正在迅速改变。
    据记者最近从湖北省统计局获悉，全省工业总产值（不包括手工业）早就提前一年超过了国家规定的1957年的计划水平，比1952年增长一倍半以上。工业生产平均每年增长26.98％，超过了五年计划中每年递增18.4％的指标，今年上半年，全省工业总产值又超额4.16％完成了原定计划。
    湖北省列入中央或本省五年计划的产品中，已经有原煤、生铁、钢、钢材、铁铸管、内燃机、电动机、双轮双铧犁、民用船舶、滚珠轴承、货车、机制纸、水泥、石膏、棉纱等二十种产品，在去年达到了1957年的生产水平；今年上半年，又有硫酸、纸浆等产品达到了五年计划水平。
    几年来，湖北工业系统试制和生产了好几百种新产品，其中有八○○号高级水泥，震动式打桩机，大桥牌防风防雨火柴，双臂吊车，三六二八型硬质合金车力磨床，三十吨勹十一保温车，空心混凝土电杆，高级石棉压力管，规律变形钢筋和高级合金钢，优质弹簧钢，不锈耐热钢，以及型式众多的条播机、脱壳机、喷雾器等。这些产品的质量良好。
    湖北省工业的迅速发展，使工农业之间的比重和工业内部生产结构起了显著的变化。在全省工农业总产值中，工业总产值已经从1952年的16.05％增长到1956年的27.8％。生产资料工业在工业内部也得到优先发展，特别是作为重工业核心的机器制造工业提高得更快，已经由主要从事修理作业的性质转变为能生产出像货车、金属切削机床等产品的新型工业企业。
    在第一个五年计划期间，湖北地区各项基本建设任务很大，到今年上半年，地方基本建设投资已经超额5.8％提前完成五年计划。五年中已经有许多基建单位陆续完工。工程十分艰巨复杂的武汉长江大桥，已经比国家计划提前近两年建成；已经建成并投入生产的还有汉阳枕木防腐厂、武汉天一印染厂等许多过去为湖北省所没有的新的工矿企业部门。这些新建和扩建的工业部门投入生产以后，使工业总产值在国民经济中的比重大为提高。仅据汉阳枕木防腐厂、武汉冶电业局（新增能力部分）等十八个企业的1956年产值计算，就相当于1949年全省现代工业产值的一倍以上。工业生产和基本建设的蓬勃发展迅速改变了旧的城市面貌。原来商业城市的武汉现在变成以生产为主的工业城；黄石变成了一座新兴的工业城市。
