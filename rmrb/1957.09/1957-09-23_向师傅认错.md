    Apologizing to the Master
    Dong Shanyuan
    A sudden rainstorm in the evening washed away the day's heat, and a cool breeze brought a hint of autumn. Xiao Zhou, a clerk at the jointly-owned Yue Shengtang Chinese Medicine Store, returned from the district store's reasoning and struggle session with a troubled heart. After nine o'clock that night, he sat alone at his desk, lost in thought. The more he thought, the more agitated he became, his face flushed, and sweat trickled from his forehead.
    He took out a business study notebook from his drawer, which he had prepared when he became an apprentice at the store last spring. It was already filled with the names and properties of medicines... He had once spent a lot of time on it, unwilling to put it down. But it had been almost half a year since he last touched it. Opening the notebook, almost every page had neatly written brush-stroke characters corrected for typos, and there were also annotations of alternative names for medicines or drug contraindications, etc. These were all corrections made by Xiao Zhou's master, old shop assistant Wang Ruming, wearing his reading glasses. Master Wang often said, "When I was an apprentice, I did odd jobs for three years and still couldn't get near the counter. Now we want to help you master the business within a year, which has never happened before in our line of work. What we do here is related to people's lives, so we can't be careless in the slightest!" These words had once given him great encouragement, but how long had it been since he thought about them? Xiao Zhou thought as he flipped through the notebook, when suddenly the Bao Jiao Bao Xue (guaranteed teaching and learning) contract fell out of the notebook. He hadn't checked it for half a year, and he didn't have the courage to open it. So he closed the notebook, stood up, and walked to the front counter.
    He turned on the sun lamp, and the counter was brightly lit. More than a year ago, almost every night his master would take him to familiarize himself with the medicinal materials and the locations of the medicine drawers. More than a hundred drawers, more than four hundred kinds of medicinal materials, the master taught him over and over again, often not willing to rest until after others had gone to sleep. Tonight, he was alone, feeling lonely, the counter seemed several times more spacious than usual, and it seemed that every medicine drawer was asking him, "Where is your master?" He clearly recalled an incident: once everyone else was asleep, he secretly got up again to memorize the medicine drawers. He didn't know when, but his master had also come. He explained the rules of the medicine drawer arrangement to him and said with a hint of reproach, "You must get a good night's sleep in the future. If you don't sleep well at night, you might make mistakes at work during the day, which is not a joke."
    The wall clock struck ten, interrupting his thoughts. Looking up, his eyes fell on the silk banner on the wall. It was the prize awarded by the company to the six pairs of masters and apprentices in the store at the end of the year, and Xiao Zhou was one of them. But after receiving the award, he suddenly felt that he had learned everything, and his master was nothing more than that. At this time, the private manager of the store often praised him to his face for being young and promising, and also said, "You are more flexible than the old shop assistants, and your future is limitless. You won't be like your master, who has been a salesperson for more than thirty years."
    Gradually, Xiao Zhou's attitude towards his master deteriorated. Once, he grabbed the wrong medicine, which was immediately discovered and corrected by his master. In the evening, he was strictly criticized, but Xiao Zhou said that his master was deliberately making things difficult for him, and the master and apprentice argued. At this time, the manager came over again to act as a peacemaker: "Why bother? No one is perfect, who can be without mistakes. Not to mention a novice, even if I, the manager, go down to the counter, I can't avoid making a mistake." This added fuel to the fire, and Xiao Zhou actually said to his master, "Don't be afraid that I will learn everything and make you look bad! This is the new society, you won't starve to death if you teach your apprentice." Wang Ruming couldn't hold back his anger and said, "Okay, your wings have hardened, fly away yourself!" The relationship between the master and apprentice broke down from then on, and they ignored each other.
    This afternoon, Xiao Zhou participated in the district-wide debate meeting between the shop assistants and the private managers, and heard Wang Ruming and many old shop assistants expose the manager's conspiracy, and learned how the capitalists had harbored resentment towards the old shop assistants since the Five-Anti Campaign. Only then did he see through that two-faced jackal. He regretted that his speech at the meeting this afternoon was not strong enough, and he wished he could bite that jackal. Now he was awake, "That's right! Go apologize to the master!" Xiao Zhou turned off the light and walked towards the dormitory.
    There were two guests talking in Wang Ruming's room. Xiao Zhou hadn't been here for a long time. He walked to the door and his eyes met his master's. For some reason, he felt a little timid, turned a corner, and went back to his dormitory. He thought: How embarrassing would it be in front of others? What if the master ignores me, wouldn't that be even more awkward?
    The comrades were all asleep, but Xiao Zhou was still sitting blankly. Suddenly, he thought of writing a letter to his master to apologize. He wrote half of it and felt that it wasn't right: we're together every day, why do this? Just as he put down his pen, his master appeared at the door. Xiao Zhou couldn't help but go up to him, "Master, are you still not asleep?" "Um, don't wake the others, let's sit in the yard for a while!"
    The moon emerged from the clouds, and the cool breeze gently swayed the flower shadows in the yard. The fresh mint exuded a refreshing fragrance that was soothing to the heart. Xiao Zhou moved two stools, and the master and apprentice sat down facing each other. By the moonlight, Wang Ruming could vaguely see that Xiao Zhou's eyes were full of regretful tears...

    向师傅认错
    董善元
    傍晚一阵骤雨，洗去了一天的炎热，凉风吹过，已经有几分秋意了。公私合营悦生堂国药店店员小周从区店参加过说理斗争会回来，心情很不平静。夜里九点多，他独自坐在灯前沉思，越想心里越热，脸胀红了，汗从额角渗出来。
    他从抽屉里取出一本业务学习笔记，这是他去年春天进店作学徒后预备的；上面已经记满了药名、药性……，他曾经手不释卷地在上边用过不少功夫。可是算来已将近半年没有动它了。打开本子，几乎每页都有工楷的毛笔字改正过的错别字，还有添注上的药品别名或药性禁忌等等，这是小周的师傅老店员王汝明戴着花镜给他修改过的。王师傅常说“我学徒的时候，打杂三年还摸不着进柜台，现在我们要帮助你在一年以内掌握业务，在咱们这一行还是从来没有的事呢。咱们做的这行当可关系着人命哪，丝毫也马虎不得！”这些话曾经给过他很大的鼓舞，可是怎么好久不曾想起来了呢？小周一边想一边翻着本子，忽然包教保学合同从本子里掉出来。半年没有检查了，他没有勇气展开它。于是阖上本子，站起来向前柜走去。
    他拉开太阳灯，柜台里一片雪亮。一年多以前，几乎每天晚上师傅都带着他熟悉药材和药斗子的部位。一百多个斗子，四百多种药材，师傅一遍一遍地教他，常常在别人睡了以后，他们师徒还不肯休息。今夜只有他一个人，感到孤零零的，柜台里好像比平日空旷了几倍，而且似乎每个药斗子都在问他“你师傅呢？”他清晰地回忆起一件事：有一次别人都睡觉了，他又偷偷地起来记药斗。不知什么时候，师傅也跟来了。他向他讲述了药斗排列的规律，并且带点责备地说：“以后要好好睡觉，晚上睡不好，白天工作上出点差错可不是玩的。”
    壁钟敲过十下，打断了他的思绪。一抬头，眼光正落在墙头的锦旗上。那是年终评奖时，公司奖给这个店里的六对师徒的，小周也是其中之一。可是受奖以后，他一下子觉得自己学成了，师傅也不过如此。店里的私方经理这当儿就常常当面夸奖他年青有为，还说“你比老店员头脑灵活，前途不可限量。不会像你师傅那样，干了三十多年还不过是个售货员。”
    慢慢儿，小周对师傅的态度变坏了。有一次他抓错了药，被师傅马上发现和纠正了，晚上严格地批评了他，小周却说师傅故意给他小鞋穿，师徒争论起来。这时那位经理又过来作和事老了：“何必呢？人非圣贤，谁能无错，莫说是新手，我经理下柜也免不了出个差错。”这一来火上浇油，小周竟对师傅说“你甭怕我学成了显不出你来！这是新社会，教会徒弟饿不死师傅了。”王汝明实在忍不住气了，他说“好，你翅膀硬了，自己飞吧！”师徒的感情从此破裂，以后便谁也不理谁了。
    今天下午，小周参加了全区店员们和私方经理的辩论大会，听到王汝明和很多老店员揭发了那个经理的阴谋，知道了五反运动以来资本家怎样对老店员们怀恨在心，这才识破了那个两面三刀的豺狼。他后悔下午在会上自己的发言还是不够劲，他恨不得咬那个豺狼一口。现在他清醒了，“对！向师傅认错去！”小周关上灯向宿舍走去。
    王汝明的屋里正有两个客人在谈话。小周好久没有到这里来了，他走到门口，正好和师傅的眼光碰在一起，不知怎的他觉得有点胆怯，转了个弯又回到自己宿舍去了。他想：当着别人的面多么难为情？万一师傅不理自己，那不就更下不来台吗？
    同志们都睡了，小周还是楞楞地坐着。忽然，他想到给师傅写封信去认错。写了半截又觉得不对头：天天在一起，干嘛来这一套？刚搁下笔，师傅却在门口出现了。小周不由地迎上去“师傅，您还没睡？”“嗯，别吵醒别人，咱们到院子里坐一会吧！”
    月亮从云层里钻出来，凉风轻轻地撼动着满院花影，鲜薄荷散发着沁人心脾的清香。小周搬过两个凳，师徒对面坐下来。借着月光，王汝明还隐约地看到小周的眼里含满了忏悔的泪水……。
