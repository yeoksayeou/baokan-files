Visiting Jining County, Which Implements "Meetings in the Fields"
By our reporter Lin Mo

    Zhang Wanjing, the Party Secretary of Jining County, Inner Mongolia, and the township cadres have jointly created a method of "meetings in the fields," which relieves rural cadres and the masses of the burden of staying up late and losing work time due to meetings. It fundamentally solves the contradiction in economic interests between grassroots cadres and the masses who are separated from production. Rural workers also have more opportunities to participate in production, connect with the masses, and combine mental labor with physical labor.

    The "meetings in the fields" method has been promoted throughout Jining County. The Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Department of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee plans to promote this method to rural areas throughout the region.

    How did this new working method come about? What role can it play in rural work? How exactly are "meetings in the fields" conducted? To understand these issues, I made a visit to Jining County.

    Two Years of History

    Originally, the "meetings in the fields" method has had a tortuous history of two years in Jining County.

    In the summer of 1955, County Party Secretary Zhang Wanjing took a group of cadres to the Jiming Cooperative in Magai Township to rectify the cooperative.

    Initially, to ensure that the rectification of the cooperative did not affect production, Zhang Wanjing wanted to talk to the cadres about work and understand the situation among the cooperative members, so he went to hoe the fields with them. Once, while resting at the edge of the field, the cooperative members began to complain to him about the difficulty of attending meetings. One cooperative member said:

    "Secretary Zhang, you've hoed the ground with us all day today, you should have tasted the flavor of it, right? Look, after suffering like this all day, everyone is exhausted. After dinner, as soon as we put down our bowls, we just want to grab a pillow and lie down to stretch our backs, but the cooperative is calling for meetings! Meetings! We go there and sit there, so sleepy that our heads are hanging on our necks, nodding off constantly. We don't hear a word of what anyone is saying, and then we're asked to discuss and make speeches. What are we supposed to say?"

    These words from the peasant touched Zhang Wanjing's heart, and he took it as a problem to be considered.

    He further deepened his understanding of this issue by consulting with township and cooperative cadres. Similarly, everyone told him about the difficulties of attending meetings. They talked about how everyone has joined the cooperative now, and everyone has to rely on labor and earn work points to eat. Attending meetings during the day means a real loss of work time. What about attending meetings at night? According to rural customs, by the time everyone is gathered after dinner, it's often past 9 o'clock. Once the meeting starts, it goes on until 11 or 12 o'clock, past midnight, which will affect production the next day.

    Zhang Wanjing constantly explored ways to solve this problem. He noticed the peasants' working habits in the fields: there are two or three breaks every day when hoeing the ground, each lasting twenty or thirty minutes. He sometimes used the break time to talk to everyone about some issues. The cooperative members listened with great interest and chatted lively. Sometimes he consciously raised one or two questions for the cooperative members to discuss, which was equivalent to holding a small meeting. He further considered whether it was possible to hold meetings in the fields, using the labor break time to raise the issues to be discussed, and then discuss them while working? He shared his thoughts with the cadres and the masses. Li Wenshan, the township Party branch secretary at the time, was very enthusiastic about this matter. After some deliberation among the cadres, Li Wenshan and Zhang Wanjing actively prepared and conducted an experiment among the cadres first.

    That time they convened an enlarged meeting of the cooperative's management committee. The twenty-odd people who attended the meeting hoed radishes together. The person chairing the meeting used two break times (about one hour each time) to report to everyone on how the cooperative should carry out labor competitions and adjust livestock rental prices. During hoeing, they were divided into groups for discussion. After half a day of the meeting, each person had earned an average of four work points. In the end, everyone said: Meetings in the fields, people are not sleepy, the mind is clear, the content of the meeting is really heard; the discussion is enthusiastic, with laughter and interest.

    From then on, the cadres of Magai Township discovered a good way to hold meetings without losing work time. For the past two years, they have held most of their meetings in the fields during the busy farming season.

    During the county's summary of the cooperative rectification work, Comrade Zhang Wanjing introduced the method of "meetings in the fields" in Magai Township to everyone at the enlarged cadre meeting of the county. Unfortunately, this matter did not receive enough attention from everyone at the time. Soon after, Zhang Wanjing left work to seek medical treatment.

    During the cooperative rectification in the summer of 1956, some leading comrades of the county Party committee remembered the experience of "meetings in the fields." At that time, they also called on the cadres sent to the countryside to combine rectification with production and move meetings to the fields. It is said that some places did this, but the county Party committee leadership did not conduct inspections and summaries of the results.

    Another Experiment

    This spring, Zhang Wanjing recovered from his illness and resumed work, and he brought up the matter of "meetings in the fields" again among the leading comrades of the county Party committee. At that time, some people were skeptical about this matter, and some felt that meetings in the fields might be possible during the busy summer hoeing and autumn harvesting, but it would probably not work during the spring plowing period when the work was more scattered.

    Later, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on the rectification movement, which proposed that leaders at all levels should participate in physical labor and gradually combine mental labor with physical labor. This instruction gave Comrade Zhang Wanjing great encouragement and support. He had greater confidence in the method of combining rural meetings with production.

    In May, some leading comrades of the county Party committee went to the countryside to convey Chairman Mao's report on resolving contradictions among the people. When Zhang Wanjing went to the countryside to convey the report, he combined it with spring plowing and production and conducted an experiment of holding meetings in the fields in Qingdemeng Township.

    This time, the participants included thirty-odd full-time and part-time cadres from three townships. They planned to reclaim wasteland for the Hengxing Agricultural Cooperative while holding the meeting. When the masses heard about this, they were very surprised, and everyone discussed: "It's really going to be a good show, holding a meeting in the fields!" People were also skeptical about cadres participating in production, and some said: "Ah, isn't that just putting on a show!"

    A group of cadres carried shovels to the fields. When everyone arrived, they saw that the wasteland the cooperative had allocated to them was originally a weedy, black mudflat at the foot of the mountain slope, which was solid and hard, and full of rocks. It was clear without saying that the peasants had deliberately found a difficult piece of land to test them.

    The cadres put forward the slogan: Guarantee to hold the meeting well and do the work well. Zhang Wanjing made good preparations for conveying the issue of resolving contradictions among the people, trying to be popular, concise, and focusing on the center, combined with reality. Each time, a section was conveyed during the break time, and then group discussions were held during work.

    While they were working, an eighty-one-year-old man with a white beard named Zhu Shuangxi squatted on the edge of the field and watched for a long time. After returning home, he said to the crowd: "Not bad, they are really suffering, and the work is done very carefully."

    The cadres worked for a day, and when they went back in the evening, the attitude of the masses was obviously different. The masses brought washing water to the cadres who lived in their homes and treated them warmly. Some people put felt on the kang, and in the past, they were given thin food, but now they were given thick food.

    The meeting lasted for three and a half days. The cadres' comments on this meeting were: holding meetings like this, not dozing off, full of energy, focused thinking, cool and refreshing; convey a section, discuss a section, and finally summarize, the understanding of the content is more real, it is really a clear meeting.

    Can meetings be held in the fields in the spring? Everyone's labor achievements are a powerful illustration. During the meeting, everyone opened up two mu of new wasteland, six fen of cultivated wasteland, and dug thirty vegetable plots. Each person earned an average of twelve work points. The wasteland they opened was first dug with shovels, then plowed with a plow, and harrowed twice. They picked out grass roots and several cartloads of stones, and pulled eight carts of manure, planting yams carefully. The cooperative members all said: Even if we did it ourselves, it wouldn't be so careful.

    Widespread Promotion Throughout the County

    In May, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on the participation of leading personnel at all levels in physical labor. Immediately following this, a upsurge of cadres participating in physical labor appeared in Jining County. This created favorable conditions for further promotion of the method of holding meetings in the fields. In early June, Comrade Zhang Wanjing introduced the experience of "meetings in the fields" again at the county's three-level expanded cadre meeting. Cadres throughout the county, from top to bottom, attached great importance to this matter. After the meeting, the cadres brought this experience back to the townships and cooperatives to promote and implement it, and it was immediately welcomed by rural cadres and the broad masses.

    In mid-July, I visited some cadres in Jining County who had returned from work in various townships and five township cadres. The results of the investigation were: most of the meetings in the townships and cooperatives were moved to the fields. The names of the meetings they listed included fifteen or sixteen types, which almost included various meetings of townships, cooperatives, Party, League, and women's organizations. They said: Holding meetings in the fields, people arrive so neatly! When the meeting starts, they are energetic, do not doze off, and are not afraid of losing work time.

    There are many part-time and non-full-time cadres in rural areas. In the past, some people were afraid of losing work time due to difficult family lives, so they often "escaped" meetings, and there were many absentees when meetings were held. Now this problem has been solved. Qingdemeng Township has held thirty-four meetings, large and small, in the past two months, and only two meetings were held indoors. Combining thirty-two meetings, the cadres worked a total of one hundred and eighty-one workdays.

    The Bulinhengmu (Unity) National United Cooperative held a Party branch meeting in the fields, and the ten Party members earned an average of nine work points each. Since the establishment of the branch, this was the first time that no one was absent from the meeting. Party member Xu Er said: "In the past, because of the difficulty of life, I was afraid of losing work time, so I came to meetings less often. Like today, after the meeting, I earned ten work points. If we hold meetings in this way, we guarantee that no one will fall behind."

    In the past, rural Party branch education had to be interrupted during busy farming seasons. Now all six Party branch instructors in the county go to the fields to teach Party lessons. Party members hoe the ground while listening to lectures, and they can continue as usual during the tense summer hoeing period.

    Their Experience

    According to the experience of Jining County, it is best to hold meetings in the fields in combination with production in summer and autumn. At this time, there are more collective work such as hoeing, harvesting, and threshing, and it is easy to arrange what kind of work to do during the meeting. In the spring, the work such as plowing and sowing is more scattered, and there are difficulties in combining meetings with production, but if you actively look for it, there are still many jobs that can be done, such as: building pig pens, repairing toilets, reclaiming wasteland, repairing canals, building dams, and making adobe bricks.

    Of course, the method of holding meetings in the fields cannot be made absolute, thinking that any meeting can be held in the fields. In order to combine meetings with production, regardless of the nature and importance of the work, whether it is suitable or not, if you force yourself to do it, you will inevitably make the mistake of formalism. Some emergency meetings, or meetings for mutual observation and comparison, and inspection are not suitable for holding in the fields.

    According to the experience of Jining County, the following points should be paid attention to in holding "meetings in the fields" well: (1) Make good preparations for the meeting, the speech should be concise, the center should be clear, each meeting should focus on solving one or two problems, and the meeting time should not be too long. (2) What kind of production to engage in during the meeting must be properly arranged in advance, and it must not be randomly grabbed temporarily. (3) Work scoring must be based on the unified standards of the cooperative; for the payment of labor work points and remuneration for part-time and non-full-time personnel, the method of circulating work tickets can be adopted between cooperatives and teams.

    访问实行“田间开会”的集宁县
    本报记者　林沫
    内蒙古集宁县县委书记张万精同志和乡干部共同创造了一种“田间开会”的办法，解除了农村干部和群众因开会而熬夜、误工的负担；从根本上解决了脱离生产的基层干部和群众在经济利益上的矛盾，农村工作人员也有了更多的机会去参加生产，联系群众，使脑力劳动同体力劳动结合起来。
    “田间开会”的办法已在集宁县全县推广。内蒙古党委农牧部准备把这办法向全区农村推广。
    这项新的工作方法是怎么产生的？它对农村工作能起些什么作用？“田间开会”又是怎么个开法？为了了解这些问题，我到集宁县作了一次访问。
    两年的历史
    原来，“田间开会”的办法，在集宁县已有两年曲折的历史。
    1955年夏季，县委书记张万精同志带着一批干部到麻盖乡的集明社去整社。
    起初，张万精同志为了整社不影响生产，要找干部谈工作，在社员中了解情况，就同他们一块去锄地。有一次在地头休息的时候，社员们同他扯起开会的苦来。有个社员说：
  “张书记，你今日跟咱锄了一天地，该尝到这味道了吧？你看，这么受上一天，谁也乏的不行了。吃了夜饭，一推饭碗，就想顺手拉个枕头躺下展展腰，可社里就喊开会呀！开会呀！去了坐在那里，困的头挂在脖子上，一个劲打瞌睡，谁讲些什么听也没听进，末后还让讨论，发言，你说发个甚？”
    农民的这一番话，打动了张万精同志的心，他把它当作一个问题放在心上。
    他进一步向乡里、社里的干部深入了解这个问题。同样，大家也向他述说起开会的苦处。他们谈到，如今大家都入了社，人人都要靠劳动、靠挣工分吃饭，白天开会，误工实在误不起。夜晚开会呢？根据农村的习惯，吃了夜饭，把人等齐，往往就到九点多了。会一开起来，就闹到十一、二点，过半夜，就要影响第二天的生产。
    张万精同志不断摸索解决这个问题的办法。在地里，他曾注意农民的劳动习惯：锄地时每天都有两三次休息，一次休息二、三十分钟。他有时利用休息时间向大家谈些问题，社员们听起来很有兴趣，也拉扯得很热闹。有时他有意识地向社员谈一两个问题，引起大家讨论，也就等于开了一次小会。他进一步考虑到，是否可以在田间开会，利用劳动休息的时间提出要讨论的问题，劳动的时候就讨论起来？他把自己的想法同干部、群众谈了。当时的乡支书李文善同志对这事很热心。在干部中经过一阵酝酿，李文善就同张万精积极准备，先在干部中作了一次试验。
    那次他们召开的是社的管理委员会扩大会。开会的二十来个人在一起锄萝卜。主持会议的人利用两次休息的时间（每次约一小时）向大家报告，社里如何开展劳动竞赛和调整牲畜租价问题，锄地时分成小组进行讨论。开了半天会，每人平均做了四分工。末了，大家都说：田间开会，人不困，脑筋清楚，会议内容听的真；讨论的时候发言热烈，又说又笑有兴趣。
    从此，麻盖乡的干部发现了开会不误工的好办法。两年来，农忙季节他们绝大部分会都在田间开。
    在全县总结整社工作的时候，张万精同志曾把麻盖乡“田间开会”的办法在全县的扩大干部会上向大家作了介绍。可惜当时这件事未引起大家足够的重视。不久，张万精同志就离开工作医病去了。
    1956年夏季整社的时候，县委的一些领导同志又想起了“田间开会”的经验。当时也曾号召下乡的干部，整社要结合生产，会议可以搬到田间开。据说有些地方也这样作了，但结果如何，县委领导上却未进行检查和总结。
    再次试验
    今年春季，张万精同志病愈恢复工作，他又在县委的领导同志中提起“田间开会”的事。当时有的人对这事半信半疑，有的觉得，在夏锄、秋收等集体活路较多的时候，在田间开会还可以，在干活比较分散的春耕时期恐怕就不行。
    后来，中共中央发布了整风运动的指示，其中曾提出各级领导要参加体力劳动，逐步做到使脑力劳动和体力劳动结合起来。这一指示给了张万精同志很大的鼓舞和支持。他对农村开会结合生产的办法有了更大的信心。
    5月间，县委的一些领导同志分别下乡向干部传达毛主席关于解决人民内部矛盾的报告。张万精同志在下乡传达的时候，就结合春耕生产在庆德孟乡作了一次田间开会的试验。
    这次参加开会的有三个乡的脱产和半脱产干部，共三十来人。他们计划一边开会，一边给恒星农业社开荒。群众听说这事都很奇怪，大家议论着：“真是闹好看哩，开个会还跑到地里去！”人们对干部参加生产也抱着怀疑态度，有的说：“唉，那还不是作作样子！”
    一群干部扛着铁锹下地。大家到地里一看，社里划给他们要开的荒地，原是山坡下一块乱草滩、黑胶泥地，又结实又硬，还满是乱石头。不说也明白了，这是农民故意给找上一块猪头地，要来考验他们。
    干部们提出口号：保证要把会开好，活做好。张万精同志对解决人民内部矛盾问题的传达作了很好的准备，尽量作到通俗、扼要，抓住中心，结合实际。每次利用休息时间传达一段，接着就在干活时分组进行讨论。
    他们干活的时候，村里有个叫朱双喜的八十一岁的白胡子老汉，蹲在地边上看了很久。他回去以后向众人说：“不错，人家是实在受哩，活做的挺细法。”
    干部们劳动了一天，晚上回去，群众的态度就显然不同了。干部住在谁家，群众给端洗脸水，热情招待，有的炕上铺了毡，往日给吃稀的，这时却给作了稠的。
    会议共开了三天半，干部们对这次会的评语是：这样开会，不打瞌睡，精神饱满，思想集中，清风凉哨；传达一段，讨论一段，最后总结，对内容理解比较真切，真是清清楚楚地开了一次会。
    春季能否在田间开会？大家劳动的成绩就是一个有力的说明。会议期间，大家共开生荒地二亩，熟荒地六分，还挖了三十畦菜地，每人平均做了十二分工。他们开的荒地，先用锹刨了，又用犁耕过，还耙了两遍，捡出了草根和几大车石头，拉上了八车粪，精精细细地种上了山药。社员们都说：让咱们自己作，也没那么细法。
    全县普遍推广
    5月间，中共中央发出了关于各级领导人员参加体力劳动的指示。紧跟着，集宁县就出现了干部参加体力劳动的热潮。这就给进一步推广田间开会的办法造成了有利条件。6月初，张万精同志在全县的三级扩干会上，再一次介绍了“田间开会”的经验。全县干部从上到下都十分重视这件事。会后，干部们把这个经验带回乡里、社里推广实行，立即受到农村干部和广大群众的欢迎。
    7月中旬，我访问了集宁县一些从各乡工作回来的干部和五个乡的乡干部，调查的结果是：乡里、社里绝大部分会都搬到田间开了。他们所列举的会议的名称有十五、六种，差不多包括了乡里、社里、党、团和妇女组织的各种会议。他们说：田间开会，人到的可齐捷哩！开起会来有精神，不打瞌睡，又不怕误工。
    农村有很多半脱产和不脱产的干部，过去有些人因家庭生活困难，怕误工，就经常“逃”会，开起会来缺席的人不少。现在这个问题解决了。庆德孟乡最近两个月中共开大小会三十四次，只有两次会是在屋内开的。结合三十二次会议，干部们共作了一百八十一个劳动日。
    布力恒牧（团结）民族联合社在田间召开党的分支部会，十个党员平均每人做了九分工。他们自建立支部以来，开会一人不缺这还是头一次。党员徐二说：“过去我因为生活困难，怕误工，开会来的少。像今天这样，开了会还赚了十分工。照这办法开会，保证谁也不落后。”
    农村党的支部教育，过去每到农忙时就要中断，现在全县的六个支部教员，都到田间上党课，党员一边锄地，一边听讲，在紧张的夏锄期间都能照常进行。
    他们的经验
    据集宁县的经验，结合生产在田间开会，夏季和秋季最好办。这时锄地、收割、打场等集体性的活路较多，开会时作什么活，容易安排。在春季，耕地、播种等活路比较分散，开会生产有困难，但如果主动寻找，可做的活还是不少的，例如：砌猪圈，修厕所，开荒，修渠，打坝，托土坯等都是可以的。
    当然，也不可把田间开会的办法绝对化，认为不论什么会都可以到田间开。为了开会结合生产，不问活路的性质、轻重，是否适合，勉强去作，也必然会犯形式主义的毛病。有些紧急会议，或相互观摩评比、检查的会议均不适于在田间举行。
    根据集宁县的经验，开好“田间会议”需要注意以下几点：（一）对会议要作很好的准备，讲话要精悍，中心明确，每次会集中解决一两个问题，会议时间不可过长。（二）开会时搞什么生产，事先要有妥善的安排，绝不能临时乱抓。（三）作活评分，一定要根据社里的统一标准；对半脱产、不脱产人员的劳动工分和报酬的支付，可在社与社、队与队之间采用流通工票的办法。
