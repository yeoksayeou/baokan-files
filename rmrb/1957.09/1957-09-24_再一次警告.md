    Another Warning
    By a Commentator of This Newspaper

    The "Dapeng Theater Troupe" belonging to Chiang Kai-shek's air force, with the permission and support of the British government, openly entered Britain under the banner of the so-called "Republic of China" and began performing in London on September 16. During the troupe's performance, the so-called "Republic of China" national anthem and the British national anthem were openly played, and the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Thorneycroft, and other audience members stood at attention to pay their respects. This is a blatant manifestation of the British government's pursuit and cooperation with the United States in promoting the policy of creating "two Chinas," disregarding the repeated opposition and warnings of the Chinese government and the Chinese people. This deliberate attempt by the British government to antagonize China has aroused great indignation among the Chinese people. Our Chargé d'Affaires in London issued a statement on this matter, which once again revealed the truth and expressed the solemn position of the Chinese people.

    This time, the Chiang Kai-shek clique sent its air force propaganda group, the "Dapeng Theater Troupe," to Britain for the purpose of carrying out conspiratorial activities against the motherland and undermining the unity of the motherland. This is a well-known fact, and even the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "Central News Agency" and "Central Daily News" dare not deny it. However, on September 12, a British Foreign Office spokesman hypocritically said that the troupe was not invited to London to perform "at the invitation of the British government," but was entirely a "private matter" and "had nothing to do with the British government," attempting to shirk the responsibility that the British government should bear in this incident. The truth is undeniable and impossible to distort. As pointed out in our Chargé d'Affaires' statement in London on September 21 and in the commentary in this newspaper on September 10, this troupe has always been a propaganda group of Chiang Kai-shek's air force. Before its departure, it was personally received by Chiang Kai-shek and Yu Hongjun, the head of the Chiang gang's Executive Yuan, who instructed them to strengthen their activities against China. It is incomprehensible that it dared to openly go to Britain under the banner of the so-called "Republic of China" to carry out its political conspiracy activities without the permission and support of the British government. Although the British government said that it did not invite the troupe to perform in Britain, it is impossible to deceive anyone by claiming that the British government's permission for the troupe to go to Britain under the banner of the so-called "Republic of China" to carry out activities against China has "nothing to do with the British government." This statement shows that the British government is playing a trick of "covering one's ears while stealing a bell," on the one hand, shirking its responsibility, attempting to conceal the truth, and deceiving the British people, and on the other hand, condoning the activities of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in order to poison Sino-British relations, interfere in China's internal affairs, and create "two Chinas." However, the truth cannot be concealed, the British people will not be deceived, and the British government cannot escape the condemnation of all righteous people.

    Doberny, the host of the Chiang gang's troupe in Britain, and the London Star Evening News and others also came out to echo, saying that the Chiang gang's troupe was a "professional" and "folk" troupe, "unrelated to politics," and slandered our Chargé d'Affaires' previous statement as involving politics in artistic activities. In fact, it is Britain itself that has brought politics into art. As is well known, our government and people have always advocated the development of cultural exchange activities that are conducive to promoting understanding and friendship between the people of all countries, which is also evident in the great achievements in promoting peaceful coexistence between China and the people of all countries.

    However, the facts show that the so-called "Republic of China National Theater Troupe" now performing in Britain is obviously not a "professional" or "folk" troupe, its activities in Britain obviously cannot be said to be "unrelated to politics," and even less can it be said to be for the purpose of exchanging culture and promoting friendly relations between the Chinese and British peoples. On the contrary, it is carrying out propaganda and activities to create "two Chinas," undermining China's national unity, interfering in China's internal affairs, and poisoning Sino-British relations under the guise of so-called "professionalism" and "folk character." Britain is a country that has established diplomatic relations with China. There is only one China in the world – the People's Republic of China, representing 600 million people. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and liberating Taiwan is China's internal affair. However, the British government actually allows the propaganda group of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique to carry out anti-China activities in London under the guise of representing China, and British government officials actually stand at attention to pay their respects to the so-called "national anthem" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Is it not extremely clear who has brought politics into artistic activities, and who is supporting the propaganda group of the Chiang Kai-shek clique to engage in activities that betray the motherland and undermine the unity of the motherland?

    The Chinese people cannot tolerate and resolutely oppose any conspiracy to create "two Chinas." The Chinese people are willing to once again issue a solemn warning to those in the British ruling group who are creating "two Chinas" and antagonizing China: their conspiracy to follow the United States in creating "two Chinas" is doomed to failure, and if they continue to be ignorant of the times and continue to do so, they will surely suffer the consequences.

    再一次警告
    本报评论员
    蒋介石空军所属的“大鹏剧社”在英国政府的允许和支持下，公然打着所谓“中华民国”的旗帜进入英国，并且已于9月16日在伦敦开始演出。该剧团演出时公然奏了所谓“中华民国”国歌和英国国歌，出席这次演出的英国财政大臣桑尼克罗夫特和其它观众全体肃立致敬。这是英国政府不顾中国政府和中国人民的一再反对和警告，追随和配合美国推行制造“两个中国”政策的一次露骨的表现。英国政府这种蓄意与中国作对的做法，引起了中国人民极大的愤怒。我国驻伦敦代办处特为此事发表声明，这一声明再次揭露了事实真相，表示了中国人民的严正立场。
    这次蒋介石集团派遣其空军宣传团体“大鹏剧社”前往英国，目的在于进行反对祖国，破坏祖国的统一的阴谋活动，这是一件尽人皆知的事情，甚至连蒋介石集团的“中央社”和“中央日报”也不敢否认。可是，9月12日英国外交部发言人却假惺惺地说，这个剧团不是“应英国政府的邀请”前往伦敦演出的，完全是一件“私人事务”，“与英国政府无关”，企图推卸英国政府在这一事件上所应承担的责任。事实的真相是不容也不可能歪曲的。正如我国驻伦敦代办处9月21日的声明和本报9月10日评论中所指出的，这个剧团一直是蒋介石空军的宣传团体，这次出发前它还由蒋介石和蒋帮行政院长俞鸿钧亲自召见，指示他们加强反对中国的活动；它之敢于公然打着所谓“中华民国”的旗帜前去英国进行它的政治阴谋活动，如果不是得到英国政府的允许与支持，是不可理解的。尽管英国政府说它未出面邀请该剧团去英国演出，但是把英国政府允许这个剧团打着所谓“中华民国”的旗号去英进行反对中国的活动一事说成是和“英国政府无关”，是谁也骗不了的。这种说法表明英国政府在玩弄着一种“掩耳盗铃”的手法，一方面推脱自己的责任，企图掩盖事实真相，蒙骗英国人民，另一方面则纵容蒋介石集团的活动，以达到毒化中英关系、干涉中国内政和制造“两个中国”的目的。但是，事实真相是掩盖不了的，英国人民是不会受到蒙骗的，英国政府也逃避不了一切正义人士的谴责的。
    蒋帮剧团在英演出的主持人多伯尼和伦敦星晚报等也曾出来帮腔，说蒋帮剧团是“职业性”和“民间性”的剧团，“与政治无关”，并且诽谤我国代办处上次的声明是把政治牵入艺术活动。其实把政治牵入艺术的正是英国自己。如所周知，我国政府和人民历来主张发展有利于促进各国人民的了解和友谊的文化交流活动，这在促进中国与各国人民和平共处事业的巨大成就上也是有目共睹的。
    但是，事实说明，现在去英国演出的所谓“中华民国国剧团”显然并不是什么“职业性”和“民间性”的团体，它在英国的活动显然不能说是“与政治无关”，更不能说是为了交流文化和促进中英两国人民的友谊关系。相反地，这是在所谓“职业性”和“民间性”的幌子下进行制造“两个中国”的宣传和活动，破坏中国国家的统一，干涉中国内政，毒化中英关系。英国是与中国建立了外交关系的一个国家。世界上只有一个中国——代表六亿人民的中华人民共和国，台湾是中国的领土，解放台湾是中国的内政。但是，英国政府竟然允许台湾蒋介石集团的宣传团体打着冒充中国的旗号在伦敦进行反对中国的活动，英国政府的官员们居然对蒋介石集团所谓“国歌”肃立致敬，是谁把政治牵入了艺术活动，是谁在支持蒋介石集团的宣传团体进行背叛祖国，破坏祖国统一的活动，不是异常显明吗？
    中国人民对于任何制造“两个中国”的阴谋都是不能容忍的和坚决反对的。中国人民愿意再一次向英国统治集团中制造“两个中国”、与中国为敌的那些人提出严正的警告：他们追随美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋是注定要失败的，他们如果继续不识时务再搞下去，将来一定要自食其果。
