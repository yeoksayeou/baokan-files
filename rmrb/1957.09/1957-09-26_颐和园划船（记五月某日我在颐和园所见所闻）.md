    Boating in the Summer Palace
    (A Record of What I Saw and Heard in the Summer Palace on a Day in May)
    Chen Yi
    We went to the Summer Palace together.
    First, we lined up to buy tickets,
    Then waited for tickets to go boating.
    Dozens of people lined up in a long queue,
    Standing for many minutes.
    The friend standing in front of us
    Was getting impatient!
    He started complaining:
    "Why do we have to buy tickets to visit the park?
    Why do we have to buy tickets to go boating?
    And why don't they have more boats?
    Making us waste time standing in line.
    This kind of socialism
    Is really not as good as before liberation!"
    Someone was about to explain to him,
    But an old man next to him spoke up first.
    He said: "Let an old man like me chime in.
    I've been here for decades.
    I saw the Empress Dowager celebrate her birthday,
    I saw the Empress Dowager entertain foreign guests in the park,
    I heard that Li Hongzhang wanted to build a navy,
    But the Empress Dowager insisted on using the funds to build the Summer Palace.
    Later, the Northern Warlords were in power,
    And the Summer Palace was opened to the public.
    But apart from foreigners and big officials,
    There were very few visitors!
    When it fell into the hands of Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang,
    It was even more chaotic!
    A treasure-robbing ring even appeared in the Forbidden City,
    And they weren't ordinary people,
    Some were famous scholars,
    Some were members of the Kuomintang Central Committee!
    Then when it fell into the hands of the Japanese,
    It was even more miserable.
    We old men who guarded the park,
    Not only went hungry,
    But our lives were also in danger.
    Since the Communist Party came, the situation has completely changed!
    Not only was it renovated and painted, but flowers, trees, and various art exhibitions were also added.
    Every Sunday it's truly a sea of people,
    One day last May, the number of visitors exceeded 70,000.
    It's truly a people's world,
    Tell me, who in Beijing hasn't visited the park!
    These days, reading the newspapers,
    There are even university professors,
    Saying truly novel things.
    They want the Communist Party to withdraw from the schools,
    They want the Communist Party to step down.
    Such high-level intellectuals,
    Their knowledge is truly pathetically low.
    Don't they even know that the Communist Party withdrawing and stepping down
    Is equivalent to restoring corruption and theft,
    Equivalent to throwing the world into chaos?
    I think they are not stupid, but have ulterior motives,
    It's definitely not just idle chatter!
    I want to propose a counter-proposal:
    That is, the Communist Party should firmly grasp the leadership!
    It must not withdraw or step down,
    Including in all situations, including this Summer Palace!
    Comrades! Please think about it:
    Due to the leadership of the Communist Party,
    Everything is organized, planned, and trained;
    Through long-term struggle and sacrifice,
    The people finally achieved revolutionary victory.
    So today, to build socialism,
    Queuing to buy tickets, buying tickets to go boating,
    What are you complaining about? What difficulties are you protesting?"
    The old man hadn't finished speaking,
    And the impatient friend lowered his head in silence.
    He bought his boat ticket,
    And sheepishly went boating.
    When it was our turn to buy tickets,
    We got on the boat in turn.
    With one stroke of the paddle, the boat left the shore,
    With two strokes, the boat was like an arrow shot from a bowstring,
    Three strokes, four strokes, water splashed everywhere.
    Soon the boat reached the center of Kunming Lake,
    And the entire lake and mountains came into our view.
    Look,
    The Western Hills stretch horizontally, like a large jade screen shielding half the sky.
    Look again,
    White birds lightly fly across the lake, startling the fish,
    The waves shimmer, stirring up jade ripples!
    Look again,
    A long embankment breaks the lake's surface,
    And ten thousand willow branches cannot restrain the shuttle-like tourist boats.
    Listen, the songs in the distance are both loud and light,
    Isn't it the people enjoying their leisure after intense labor?
    Look at the Tower of Buddhist Incense and the Hall of Dispelling Clouds,
    It is a straight line facing the Dragon King Pond.
    Look to the left, the scenery is like a jade scepter,
    Look to the right, "Yi Chi Yun Zai" (Remaining Clouds),
    And look at the painted pavilions and red buildings and ancient cypresses and pines,
    Contrasting each other,
    Beautifying the entire Longevity Hill!
    Ah! The scenery of the Summer Palace is extremely splendid.
    Architects can come here to study architectural engineering,
    And garden art can also find its encyclopedia here!
    It cannot be said that the construction of this garden was entirely for recreation,
    You see, it has long been a large reservoir supplying Beijing with water,
    And it also irrigates a large area of paddy fields in the western suburbs of Beijing.
    Everywhere is permeated with the wisdom and sweat of the people,
    And the designers have also painstakingly conducted scientific research!
    This may be the only good thing that Yehenala did in her life,
    She did not expect that from the destroyed navy,
    She would preserve a magnificent and beautiful garden!
    Ah! The scenery of the Summer Palace is extremely splendid!
    Even if I write this worn-out brush to pieces, how can I describe it completely!
    But let me add a note,
    Today there is also a new person and new thing,
    That is, that impatient friend,
    Happened to meet an old teacher who is good at analyzing history and the situation!
    Our boat turned north past the Stone Boat,
    Turning from the open water of the front lake to the secluded creeks and mountains of the back lake.
    The wisdom of the garden craftsmen is truly unfathomable,
    They seem to be writing articles, deliberately creating suspense, suddenly turning the page!
    They are even bolder,
    Transplanting southern streams to the Beijing plains!
    The boat goes further and turns, coincidentally encountering that impatient friend,
    We and him, unfamiliar at first, become familiar again,
    Unconsciously nodding to each other.
    It's hard to say whether it's tacit understanding,
    Nor is there any animosity!
    I guess he will be like us,
    Forever remembering this boating trip in the Summer Palace!

    颐和园划船
    （记五月某日我在颐和园所见所闻）
    陈毅
    我们结伴游颐和园。
    先站队买门票，
    后等票划船。
    几十个人排队很长，
    一站就是好多分钟。
    站在我们前面那位朋友，
    等得不耐烦！
    他先开腔讲：
    “为什么游园要买票？
    为什么又要买票才能划船？
    又为什么不多搞几只？
    弄得站队白费时间。
    这样的社会主义，
    真不如解放前！”
    有人正要向他作解释，
    旁边一位老者抢先发言。
    他说：“让我老头儿插个嘴。
    我在这儿待过几十年，
    我看过西太后做大寿，
    我看过西太后招待外宾游园，
    我听说李鸿章要办海军，
    西太后硬拉来修建颐和园。
    以后是北洋军阀当朝，
    颐和园开放准人参观。
    可是除外国人和大老官儿外，
    游人真少得可怜！
    到了国民党蒋介石手里，
    还更混蛋！
    竟然在故宫出现了盗宝集团，
    而且他们不是普通人物，
    其中有的是名流学者，
    有的是国民党中央委员！
    再说以后落在日本人手里，
    那就十分凄惨，
    我们看守园子的老头儿们，
    不仅挨饥受饿，
    连生命也难保全。
    自从共产党来了，情况压根儿改变！
    不仅翻修、粉刷，还增加了花木和各种艺术展览。
    每当星期日真是人海人山，
    去年五月有一天游人超过七万。
    真是人民世界，
    请问在北京那个不曾游园！
    这几天看报，
    居然有大学教授，
    他说话真新鲜。    
    他要共产党退出学校，
    他要共产党下台，
    这样的高级知识分子，
    他们的知识真低级得可怜。
    难道连共产党退出和下台，
    等于恢复腐败和盗窃，
    等于把天下搞乱都不晓得吗？
    我看他们不是愚蠢，而是另有阴谋，
    绝不是闲扯蛋！
    我要提一个对案：
    就是共产党应该紧紧掌握领导权！
    千万不能退出和下台，
    包括在一切场合，也应该包括这座颐和园！
    同志！请想一想：
    由于共产党的领导，
    一切有组织、有计划、有训练；
    经过长期奋斗和牺牲，
    这样，人民才取得革命的胜利。
    那么今天为搞社会主义，
    排队买票，买票划船，
    你喊什么冤？告什么艰难？”
    老者话未说完，
    那不耐烦的朋友低头无言。
    他买了船票，
    灰溜溜地去划船。
    轮到我们买了票，
    我们挨次上了船，
    我们一桨，船儿离了岸，
    二桨，船儿好似箭脱弦，
    三桨，四桨，水花乱。
    不一会儿船到昆明湖的中心，
    整个湖山映入我们的眼帘。
    你瞧，
    西山横迤，好像一座大玉屏遮蔽了半个天。
    你再瞧，
    白鸟轻飞掠湖面，把游鱼惊散，
    波光闪闪，卷起了玉澜！
    你再瞧，
    一道长堤破湖面，
    还有那万条柳丝，系不住穿梭似的游船。
    你试听，远处歌声又宏亮又轻脆，
    难道不是人民在紧张劳动后正尽情享受余闲。
    看那佛香阁与排云殿，
    它一条直线正对着龙王潭。
    看左面是湖山如意，
    看右面是意迟云在，
    再看画阁朱楼与古柏苍松，
    互相衬托，
    更美化了整个万寿山！
    啊！颐和园的景致十分灿烂，
    建筑师可以到这儿研究建筑工程，
    庭园艺术在这儿也找着百科大全！
    不可以说这园子的建造完全是为了消遣，
    你看它早就是供应北京城的大水库，
    也灌溉京西郊区一大片稻田。
    那一处都贯串着人民的智慧与血汗，
    设计师们也苦费了科学钻研！
    这也许是叶赫那拉氏一生所干的唯一好事，
    她并没意料到她从复灭的海军中，
    保留下一座宏伟而美丽的大花园！
    啊！颐和园的景致十分灿烂！
    就是写坏我这只秃笔儿怎能说得周全！
    但是让我增加一笔，
    今天还有一件新人新事，
    就是那位不耐烦的朋友，
    偏遇着一位善于分析历史和局势的老教员！
    我们的船经过石舫向北转，
    从前湖的水天空阔转到后湖的幽邃溪山。
    园艺匠的智慧真难测深浅，
    他好像做文章故弄惊险，陡然翻篇！
    他更是大胆，
    把南方的溪涧移填到京华平原！
    船再进再转恰巧与那位不耐烦的朋友打个照面，
    我们和他一回生，二回熟，
    彼此不自觉地点点头。
    这难说是默契，
    也不是有什么反感！
    我猜想他将与我们一样，
    永远记得这一次在颐和园的划船！
