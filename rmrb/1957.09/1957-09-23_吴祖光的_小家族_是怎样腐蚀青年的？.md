How Did Wu Zuguang's "Small Family" Corrupt Youth?

Cai Liang, a "loyal brother" of the "small family," recently made a special trip from Xi'an to Beijing. He didn't go to the "small family" to "reunite" as he used to, but instead took the stage at the conference to criticize Wu Zuguang's rightist words and deeds, exposing the dark secrets of Wu Zuguang's "small family" in corrupting youth.

Cai Liang is a 25-year-old young man who joined the Communist Youth League in 1949. After being dragged into the "small family" right-wing clique by bourgeois rightists, he embarked on a wrong path.

Four years ago, when Cai Liang was still studying at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, he established "friendship" with Du Gao, a key member of the "small family." After entering the "small family," he often heard mutual flattery like: "Genius, prodigy!" I am the Chinese "Belinsky," "Chekhov," and you are the future "Chinese Repin..." Wu Zuguang, the "patriarch" of the "small family," styled himself as a "prodigy," playing the role of a "good teacher and helpful friend," often praising the "talent" of the young people around him, enthusiastically advocating "individual struggle to become famous and successful," and using various methods to incite the arrogance of young people. Not long after Cai Liang joined the "small family," Wu Zuguang invited him to draw an illustration with ulterior motives. Even though it wasn't very well drawn, it was included among the illustrations of famous painters and published in a collection of essays called "Flowers of Art," to tout Cai Liang's "genius." Cai Liang was very grateful to the "small family" patriarch for his appreciation. Later, when he was about to graduate from the Central Academy of Fine Arts and was preparing to apply to study in the Soviet Union, the "small family" touted his "genius" everywhere as a major event for the whole family. However, this "genius" failed the exam and made a big scene at the school, even resorting to drinking to relieve his sorrows. Just when the League organization was patiently helping him and educating him, the "small family" reached out its poisonous hand again. At a "family banquet," they openly declared that they would use the power of their "family" to cultivate Cai Liang into a "Chinese Repin." Du Gao also said: "It doesn't matter if you don't get into studying in the Soviet Union, artists ultimately rely on their works to make a living. From now on, just paint like crazy!" At that time, Cai Liang felt particularly "warm" in the "small family."

At the same time, the "small family," just like poisoning other young people, promoted "super-class love" and "the beauty of the soul" to Cai Liang. Du Gao often introduced him to Hu Feng and Lu Ling's literary views, and said: "Discovering the beauty of the souls of ordinary people is the best art. Loving everyone is the sentiment of a great artist." After hearing these fallacies, he admired even more that the "small family" was a "combination of geniuses."

Cai Liang had made some progress in the past under the education of the Party and the League. When he was studying at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, he had served as a class leader and talked about everything with the League organization. However, after being dragged into the "small family," he became a different person. He became estranged from the League organization, looked down on everyone, and even thought that the League organization was "child's play" and that the League's organizational life was childish and uninteresting. However, he was happily peddling Hu Feng and Lu Ling's fallacies and the political rumors spread by Wu Zuguang, Du Gao and others in the school.

Recalling the detours he had taken, Cai Liang said with a heavy heart: Poisoned by these thoughts, I became more and more distant from the League organization, and finally completely degenerated ideologically and organizationally into the mire of the right-wing clique, becoming a traitor to the Communist Youth League.

This is how Wu Zuguang peddled bourgeois ideas of fame and fortune, and bestowed so-called "warmth" and "friendship," competing with the Communist Party for young people. Cai Liang's corruption was like this. Let's take a look at the fall and degeneration of Chen Minfan, who was called "little sister" in the "small family"!

Chen Minfan grew up in a middle peasant family. In 1949, when she was only fourteen years old, she joined the revolutionary ranks and soon joined the League. Four years ago, she was transferred from the army to the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture. She had a young person's enthusiasm and vigor in her work, and she had applied to join the Party. Later, she met Tian Zhuang, a key member of the "small family," and her thinking and life began to change. Tian Zhuang saw that Chen Minfan loved literature. When they met, Tian Zhuang spoke highly of a so-called literary "theory." Although Chen Minfan didn't understand it, she felt it was very fresh. Later, Tian Zhuang introduced her to Wu Zuguang, Du Gao, Wang Ming and others. The "small family" knew that she had no family in Beijing and was young, so they would invite her to play, go to the park and eat in restaurants during festivals or Sundays. She also often heard members of the "small family" say that "the Communist Party is boring and doesn't talk about human nature," which slowly made her feel that the "small family" was a "warm and free world." Du Gao and others desperately promoted fallacies such as "individual struggle" and "pride is a noble sentiment" in front of her. They also encouraged her to read Romain Rolland's "Jean-Christophe." She finally finished this masterpiece in one breath, and didn't gain anything else, but accepted "Jean-Christophe's" individualistic "fighting spirit." At that time, when she returned to the office, she felt that she had no "common language" with her comrades, and she was also indifferent and disgusted with the Communist Youth League organization. Sometimes, she even tried all kinds of tricks to avoid the League's organizational life, and cursed the League's reports as "formulaic and conceptual." She refused the League organization's help, and gradually turned to the "small family" in terms of thoughts and feelings.

During the Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries campaign, she was investigated because of her relationship with the "small family." Later, she cut off contact with members of the "small family" for a period of time, and made some progress in her work and thinking. When the office was evaluating grades and wages, she was also promoted, and her comrades also encouraged her. But soon, she got back in touch with Tian Zhuang. When she married Tian Zhuang, Wu Zuguang prepared a sumptuous meal at home to entertain her and Tian Zhuang, expressed deep "concern" for their investigation and punishment during the Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries campaign, and used sweet words to stir up their "grievances," making her realize the "humanity" and "friendship" advocated by the "small family." During the rectification campaign, she not only planned with members of the "small family" to overturn the correct conclusions made about her during the Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries campaign, but also echoed other rightists in the office, spreading rumors and making trouble, and writing big-character posters to attack the Party's leadership. Chen Minfan was thus poisoned by the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeois rightists, and became a loyal tool for the rightists to attack the Party!

While shooting the poisonous arrows of "fame and fortune" and "warmth" at young people, Wu Zuguang's "small family" also released another poisonous arrow to corrupt young people, luring them to take the bait.

Wu Zuguang was a complete "remnant" of the old society, guiding his "small family" to pursue the decadent lifestyle of landlords and the bourgeoisie. He tempted the young people around him to eat and drink extravagantly, eating at all the famous restaurants and taverns in Beijing. After drinking and eating their fill, they talked about women, and described the relationship between the sexes in a vulgar and obscene way, which corrupted some young people. Wu Zuguang also often took out his "treasured" pornographic books, pornographic paintings, and sexually stimulating pictures to lure young people to take the bait. Sometimes, they also gathered to gamble and play cards, staying up all night. Therefore, some young people were corrupted to the point of being disoriented and demoralized.

Now, after a comprehensive and thorough exposure and criticism by the Beijing drama and film circles, the black curtain of the reactionary "small family" has been uncovered. Wu Zuguang also had to admit: "After liberation, especially in recent years, my home has become a garbage dump. I am full of dirty things, so I have attracted a group of poisonous flies, who spread the toxins from me to society."

    吴祖光的“小家族”是怎样腐蚀青年的？
    新华社记者　孙世恺
    “小家族”的一个“忠实弟兄”蔡亮，最近从西安特地赶到北京，他没有像往日那样到“小家族”里去“团聚”，而是走上了批判吴祖光右派言行大会的讲台，揭穿吴祖光统率的“小家族”腐蚀青年的黑幕。
    蔡亮是个二十五岁的青年，在1949年就参加了共青团，被资产阶级右派分子拖进“小家族”右派小集团以后，踏上了歧途。
    四年前，蔡亮还在中央美术学院学习时，就和“小家族”骨干分子杜高建立了“友谊”。他进入“小家族”后，经常听到这样互相的吹捧：“天才呀，神童啊”！我是中国的“别林斯基”、“契呵夫”，你是未来的“中国列宾……”。“小家族”的“家长”吴祖光就以“神童”自居，扮演出“良师益友”的面孔，经常夸奖他周围的这伙青年的“才华”，热心倡导“个人奋斗成名成家”，利用各种方法煽动青年人的自大狂。蔡亮加入“小家族”不久，吴祖光就别有用心地邀他画一幅插画，本来画得不怎么好也摆进名画家们的插画之列，放在一本名叫“艺术的花朵”散文集中出版了，以标榜蔡亮的“天才”。蔡亮很感激“小家族”家长对他的赏识。以后，他在中央美术学院刚毕业时，准备投考留学苏联，“小家族”便作为全家族一件大事到处吹嘘他的“天才”。但是这位“天才”没有考取，便在学校里大闹情绪，以至借酒消愁，当团的组织正在耐心地帮助他教育他的时候，“小家族”又伸出了毒手。在一次“家族宴会”上公然宣称要用他们“家族”的力量把蔡亮培养成“中国的列宾”。杜高还说：“考不取留苏不要紧，搞艺术的最后还是要靠作品吃饭，以后就拼命画吧！”当时，蔡亮格外感到“小家族”的“温暖”。
    同时，“小家族”又如同毒害其他青年一样，对蔡亮宣扬“超阶级的爱”和“心灵的美”。杜高就经常向他介绍胡风、路翎的文艺观点，并且说：“发掘小人物心灵的美，才是最好的艺术，要爱一切人才是伟大艺术家的情操。”他听了这些谬论更加钦佩“小家族”是“天才的结合”。
    蔡亮过去在党和团的教育下有一定的进步，在中央美术学院里学习时曾担任过班长，对团组织是无话不谈。可是，被拖进“小家族”以后变成了另一个人。对团组织疏远了，对谁也瞧不起，竟认为团的组织是“小儿科”、团的组织生活是幼稚、没有趣味。但是在学校里却津津有味地贩卖胡风、路翎的谬论和吴祖光、杜高等人传播的政治性的流言蜚语。
    蔡亮回忆起走过的这段弯路时，怀着沉痛的心情说：我受着这些思想的毒害，对待团的组织越离越远，终于完全从思想上组织上堕落到右派小集团的泥坑里，作了共青团的叛徒。
    吴祖光正是这样贩卖资产阶级的名利思想，并施舍所谓“温暖”“友爱”，和共产党争夺青年。蔡亮被腐蚀的经过是这样，再看看在“小家族”里被称为“小妹妹”的陈敏凡失足堕落的经过吧！
    陈敏凡生长在一个中农的家庭，1949年她才十四岁就投到革命队伍里，很快入了团。她在四年前由部队调到文化部电影事业管理局，在工作上有股青年的热劲和朝气，曾提出申请入党。后来，她认识了“小家族”骨干分子田庄，从思想到生活才开始起变化。田庄看到陈敏凡爱好文学。他们见面，田庄就高谈一套所谓文艺“理论”，陈敏凡虽然不懂，却感到很新鲜。后来，由田庄介绍认识了吴祖光、杜高、汪明等人。“小家族”那伙人知道她在北京没家，年纪又小，逢年过节或星期天，便找她去玩，逛公园吃馆子。又常听“小家族”成员说，“共产党乏味，不讲人性”等等，慢慢使她感到“小家族”真是“温暖的自由天地”。杜高等人在她的面前又拼命宣扬“个人奋斗”，“骄傲才是高尚的情操”等谰言。并鼓动她看罗曼罗兰的“约翰·克利斯朵夫”。她终于一口气读完了这部巨著，没有得到别的收获，却接受了“约翰·克利斯朵夫”的个人主义的“战斗精神”。当时，她回到机关便感到和同志们没有“共同的语言”，对共青团的组织也冷淡厌恶了。甚而有时，想尽一些花招逃避团的组织生活，听了团组织的报告就咒骂是“公式化、概念化”。她拒绝团组织对她的帮助，逐渐地从思想感情上投靠到“小家族”里。
    在肃反运动中，她因为和“小家族”的关系，曾受到审查。以后，和“小家族”成员在一定时期割断了联系，在工作和思想上都有了一些进步。机关内评级评薪时，她也被提升了级别，同志们也都鼓励她。但是不久，她又和田庄搭上关系，当她和田庄结婚时，吴祖光在家中备好丰盛的酒饭招待她和田庄，对他们在肃反运动中被审查、受处分深表“关切”，用甜言蜜语煽起他们的“冤情”，使她又体会到“小家族”所倡导的“人性”和“友爱”。在整风期间，她不仅和“小家族”成员策划推翻肃反运动时对她作的正确结论，还在机关里和其他右派分子一唱一和，造谣生事，写大字报攻击党的领导。陈敏凡就这样被资产阶级右派分子的糖衣炮弹所毒害，变成右派分子向党进攻的忠实工具！
    吴祖光的“小家族”向青年射出“名利”、“温情”的毒箭同时，又放出腐蚀青年的另一支毒箭，迷惑青年上钩。
    吴祖光是个十足的旧社会“遗少”，引导他的“小家族”追求地主资产阶级腐朽的生活方式。他诱惑他周围的青年经常大吃大喝，吃遍了北京有名的饭馆酒楼，酒足饭饱之余高谈女人，把两性关系说得低级下流，使得一些青年受其腐蚀。吴祖光又经常拿出他“珍藏”的淫书淫画和刺激性感的画片，使青年上钩。有时还聚赌打牌，通宵不睡。因此，有些青年被腐蚀得神魂颠倒，意志消沉。
    现在，经过北京戏剧电影界全面而彻底地揭发和批判，已经揭穿了反动“小家族”的黑幕。吴祖光也不得不承认说：“解放之后，特别是近几年，我的家已经成了个垃圾堆了，我是充满肮脏的东西，所以我招来的都是一群有毒的苍蝇，从我这里把毒素又传播到社会上去。”
