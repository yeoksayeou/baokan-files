(Our newspaper, Shenyang, 2nd) At the recent anti-rightist struggle meeting of the literary circle convened by the Propaganda Department of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the anti-Party clique of Wang Huanan, Deputy Director of the Shenyang Municipal Bureau of Culture and Director of the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Guo Xu, Editor-in-Chief of "Mangzhong," and Wu Shan, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of "Mangzhong," was crushed.

The publication "Mangzhong," overgrown with poisonous weeds, was the main base of this anti-Party clique. From the first to the seventh issue, this publication published nearly two hundred works, sixty-seven of which were poisonous weeds, and twenty-two of these poisonous weeds were released by Wang Huanan, Guo Xu, Wu Shan, and the editorial department themselves. These poisonous weeds attacked the leading organs such as the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Shenyang Municipal Committee, the Liaoning Daily, the Shenyang Branch of the Writers Association, and leading Party cadres. According to the meeting's exposure, Guo Xu was the creator of the anti-Party program of "Mangzhong" and a "writer" who specialized in spreading poison. Wu Shan was the host of the specific editing work of "Mangzhong," a conspirator of the anti-Party program, and a faithful executor. Wang Huanan was the main head of this anti-Party clique.

After the blooming and contending began, this anti-Party clique became even more rampant. They described the Party's leadership over literature and art as "doctrinairism occupying a dominant position," and scolded the provincial committee meetings as "hand-printing" meetings. At the Shenyang Municipal Political Consultative Conference, they further smeared the Party as not understanding literature and art and not being able to lead literature and art, and put forward their own reactionary literary and art program.

The meeting revealed that Wang Huanan had always styled himself as the "Chinese Paul," but it turned out that this "legendary hero" was actually a coward who was afraid of death and fabricated history. The two injuries he had always publicized: one was in 1947 when he retreated from Siping, he was injured because he was panicked and his toe was scratched by barbed wire. The second time was in 1948, before our army liberated Jinzhou, Wang Huanan went to the logistics department for recuperation in a bullock cart due to a cold. The bullock cart passed over uneven ground, and Wang Huanan refused to get out of the car and walk despite persuasion. As a result, the cart overturned and his waist was crushed, causing paralysis of his lower limbs. However, he himself fabricated another story: he said that in the past, his leg was shot by a bullet in the war and he still asked to go to the front line, and in the Siping campaign, he sat on a bullock cart and directed the battle with crutches. When the Kuomintang planes came, the comrades with good health ran away, and no one took care of him. As a result, the horse was startled, the cart overturned, and he became a special disabled person.

The meeting also revealed that Lu Kan, Director of the Shenyang Municipal Bureau of Culture and Standing Editor of "Mangzhong," was also an accomplice and "military advisor" of this anti-Party clique.

    毒草丛生的“芒种”被摧毁
    王化南郭墟反党集团崩溃
    本报沈阳2日电  在中共辽宁省委宣传部最近召开的文学界反右派斗争大会上，击破了沈阳市文化局副局长、市文联主任王化南、“芒种”主编郭墟、“芒种”副主编吴山的反党集团。
    毒草丛生的刊物“芒种”是这个反党集团的主要阵地。这个刊物自一期至七期共发表了作品近二百篇，其中六十七篇是毒草，而王化南、郭墟、吴山及编辑部自己放的毒草就有二十二篇。这些毒草攻击了中共辽宁省委、沈阳市委、辽宁日报、作协沈阳分会等领导机关和党的领导干部。据会议揭露，郭墟是“芒种”反党纲领的制作者和专门从事放毒的“作家”。吴山是“芒种”具体编辑工作主持人、反党纲领的合谋者与忠实执行者。王化南是这个反党集团的主要头目。
    鸣放开始后，这个反党集团就更为猖獗。他们把党对文艺的领导说成是“教条主义占据着统治地位”，谩骂省委开会是“按手印”的会。在沈阳市政协会上，他们进一步污蔑党不懂文艺，不能领导文艺，并提出了他们自己的反动文艺纲领。
    会议揭露，王化南一向以“中国的保尔”自居，原来这个“传奇式的英雄”，本是个贪生怕死、伪造历史的骗子。他一贯宣扬的两次负伤：一次是1947年在四平撤出时，他因惊慌失措，脚指头被铁丝网挂破受了伤。第二次在1948年我军解放锦州前夕，王化南因患感冒坐大板车到后勤部去休养，大板车路过不平处，王化南不听劝告，拒绝下车步行，结果车翻了，腰部被砸伤，下肢瘫痪了。然而他自己编造的却是另一套：他说过去在战争中一条腿被子弹打伤还要求上前线，在四平战役坐在大板车上托着双拐指挥作战。国民党飞机来了，身体好的同志都跑掉，没有一个管他，结果马惊，车翻，成了特等残废。
    会议还揭露，沈阳市文化局局长、“芒种”常务编委鲁坎也是这个反党集团的同谋者和“军师”。
