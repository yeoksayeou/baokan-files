A Note

　　“The Talking Prize”
    Christopher Powell has recently become a "celebrity" in London. Since the end of August, his name has appeared continuously in the London "Daily Mail."
    The "Daily Mail" has a daily circulation of over 1.3 million copies. Like many other newspapers on Fleet Street, offering prizes is an important way for this newspaper to promote its circulation. Last year, the highest prize offered by this newspaper was a thatched-roof cottage inn; this year, the highest prize prepared by this newspaper is even more astonishing – a person.
    This person who is being used as a prize is Christopher Powell. He is forty-nine years old this year, and it is said that he used to be an army major, but now he is a poor unemployed man.
    The prize-giving method announced by the "Daily Mail" is: whichever reader can come up with an original job in a letter to the newspaper's editorial department for Christopher Powell to do, that reader has the right to drive him for a day. In order to increase the "interest" of readers, the newspaper also made a commodity advertisement-style description of Christopher Powell: "This person is six feet two inches tall, brave and good at fighting. He can drive, ride horses, fence, and is a good shot... He can do anything for you...".
    This matter easily reminds people of the status of slaves in slave society. The difference is that, in the eyes of the "Daily Mail," Powell is not just a "talking tool," but also a "talking prize."
    Regarding this analogy, worshippers of capitalism will argue that slaves are forced to perform labor, while Christopher Powell voluntarily accepts employment; these two are completely different.
    Indeed, Christopher Powell is accepting the employment of the "Daily Mail" and is not bound by a deed of sale. However, what makes Powell "voluntarily" accept this kind of employment? Although he has driving, riding and other skills, and can even "do anything," he does not have the right to live like a real person. Although he has a brave and combative character, he has to give up the dignity he should have as a person and endure all kinds of humiliation. Where should we find an explanation for this? The answer is neither in Powell's "slave mentality" nor in the "whimsical ideas" of the "Daily Mail." The answer lies in the cannibalistic system.
    "Having turned personal worth into exchange value," this is one of the characteristics of the capitalist system that Marx and Engels pointed out more than a hundred years ago. In capitalist countries that call themselves the "free world," a person with the ability to work, like Powell, does not have the natural right to live. The means of production and means of subsistence are all in the hands of the capitalists. They say to the Powells: if you want to live, let's make a deal like this, otherwise, please do as you wish. This really looks like a free transaction, each listens to their convenience. Powell only has the freedom to starve to death. In order to live, he has to hand himself over to the capitalists and "work" according to the method that the boss thinks is the most profitable.

### “会说话的奖品”

专栏：札记

　　“会说话的奖品”
    克里斯多夫·鲍威尔在最近突然成了伦敦的一个“著名人物”。从8月末开始，他的名字就连续在伦敦“每日简报”上出现。
    “每日简报”每日发行一百三十多万份。和舰队街的其它很多报纸一样，发奖是这家报纸推广发行的一个重要办法。去年，这家报纸发出的最高奖品是一所茅屋顶的小旅店；今年，这家报纸所准备的最高奖品更为惊人——一个人。
    这个被作为奖品的人，就是克里斯多夫·鲍威尔。他今年四十九岁，过去据说当过陆军少校，现在则是一个可怜的失业者。
    “每日简报”公布的发奖办法是：哪一个读者在给报纸编辑部的信里能够提出一件独出心裁的工作叫克里斯多夫·鲍威尔去作，这个读者就有权驱策他一天。为了增加读者的“兴味”，报纸上还对克里斯多夫·鲍威尔作了一番商品广告式的描述：“此人身高六呎二吋，好勇善斗。能驾车、骑马、击剑，而且枪法很好。……他能为你作任何事情……。
    这件事使人很容易联想起奴隶制社会里奴隶的地位来。不同的是，在“每日简报”看来，鲍威尔不只是“会说话的工具”而且是“会说话的奖品”。
    对于这种比拟，资本主义的膜拜人会争辩说：奴隶是被迫从事劳役的，而克里斯多夫·鲍威尔则是自愿接受雇佣的；这两者完全不同。
    的确，克里斯多夫·鲍威尔是接受“每日简报”的雇佣，而并没有卖身契的束缚。然而，是什么使得鲍威尔“自愿”接受这种雇佣的呢？他虽然有的是开车、骑马等等技能，甚至“能作任何事情”，却没有像一个真正的人一样生活的权利。他虽然有着好勇善斗的性格，却不得不放弃作为一个人所应有的尊严而忍受各种屈辱。这应当从哪里去找到解释呢？答案既不在鲍威尔“奴隶成性”，也不在“每日简报”的“异想天开”。答案是在吃人的制度。
    “把人的身价变成了交换价值”，这是马克思和恩格斯一百多年以前就指出的资本主义制度的特征之一。在自称“自由世界”的资本主义国家里，像鲍威尔这样一个有劳动能力的人，并没有当然的生活权利。生产资料和生活资料都掌握在资本家手里。他们对鲍威尔们说：你要活，咱们就这样成交，否则请便。这看来真像是自由交易，各听尊便。鲍威尔只有饿死的自由，为了活，他就得把自己交给资本家，按照老板认为最赚钱的办法来“工作”。
