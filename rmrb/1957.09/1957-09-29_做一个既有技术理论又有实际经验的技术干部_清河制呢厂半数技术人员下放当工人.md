Xinhua News Agency, 28th: More than half of the technical personnel at the Qinghe Woolen Mill in Beijing were sent to the front lines yesterday and today to participate in physical labor as workers.

　　These young new workers were warmly welcomed by the veteran workers when they arrived at the production site. Subsequently, under the guidance of the veteran workers, these young workers began their first real physical labor since leaving school.

　　Several young technicians who had just become workers told reporters that they were determined to train themselves into new-type workers with both technical theory and practical production experience. A deputy director of the factory told reporters that after these technical personnel have gone through several years of physical labor and mastered the practical production experience they now lack, they will become new-type technical leading cadres of the factory.

　　The young technicians who decided to participate in physical labor at the front line this time were mostly those who graduated from technical secondary schools and universities two or three years ago, a total of twenty-seven people, accounting for slightly more than 57% of the factory's existing technical personnel. In the past few days, five students who were assigned to work in this factory and who had just graduated from universities and technical secondary schools have also become production workers on the front line.

　　This bold measure to break with tradition was taken during the recent rectification campaign. Previously, like many other enterprises in China, most of the young technical personnel in this factory lacked practical production experience. As soon as they left school, they became technical cadres guiding actual production on the front line.

　　On the day the group of technical personnel were officially announced as workers, a female technician named Liang Luankun told reporters that after graduating from a technical secondary school in 1952, she was assigned to work in this factory doing management work, initially doing work such as reviewing drawings made by workers, and later taking on the work of handling rationalization proposals. She said: "Because I have no practical production experience, I am dazzled when I go to the front line, and it is difficult to find problems, and even if I find problems, I don't know how to solve them. Therefore, I am unwilling to go to the front line, and as a result, I am becoming more and more divorced from reality, which makes me very distressed." She deeply realized that knowledge in books must be combined with practical production experience to be effective. She had repeatedly asked the leadership to allow her to participate in production on the front line, but her request was not approved until this rectification campaign.

　　The reporter met a group of young technical personnel who were about to participate in physical labor on the front line in the factory director's office. They all talked about similar experiences to Liang Luankun. Li Qingbo, who graduated from a textile school in the autumn of 1955, said: "I am very envious of Soviet experts. When they come to the front line, they take off their suits, pick up tools, and can start working and really solve problems! If you want to become a technical cadre with both technical theory and practical experience, you must first be a worker!"

　　Song Baowen, who recently graduated from university and has been working as a worker on the front line for a few days, said: "Although I have only been a worker this time for a few days, I feel that I have learned many things that cannot be found in books. From these few short days, I feel that I am on the right path!"

　　According to the person in charge of the factory, most of the young technical personnel in this factory were assigned to do management work after they came here from school. Because they lack practical production experience and proletarian feelings, it is difficult for them to go deep into the front line to solve practical problems; they themselves also feel distressed because they cannot get practical training and technical improvement. During this rectification campaign, many employees put forward opinions on streamlining the management organization, and many young technical personnel also requested to start as workers to improve their technical level. According to the principle of rectifying and reforming at the same time, the factory decided to streamline the management organization and put the young technical personnel who can be drawn from management positions and lack practical experience to the front line to participate in actual production.

　　The person in charge also said that after this group of young people with certain technical theories participate in physical labor, they will learn rich practical experience from the veteran workers; and the veteran workers will learn technical theories from this group of young people. In this way, the technical level of the entire factory will be generally improved.

### 做一个既有技术理论又有实际经验的技术干部  清河制呢厂半数技术人员下放当工人

    做一个既有技术理论又有实际经验的技术干部
    清河制呢厂半数技术人员下放当工人
    新华社28日讯　北京市清河制呢厂有一半以上的技术人员昨天和今天分别下放到现场开始参加体力劳动，当了工人。
    这批年青的新工人来到生产现场的时候，受到了老工人的热烈欢迎。随后，这批青年工人在老工人带领下，开始了走出学校大门以来的第一次真正的体力劳动。
    有几位刚当了工人的青年技术人员在接见记者的时候说，他们决心把自己锻炼成为一个既有技术理论又有实际生产经验的新型工人。一个副厂长向记者说，当这批技术人员经过几年体力劳动，掌握了现在他们还缺乏的实际生产经验以后，他们将会成为本厂新型的技术领导干部。
    这个厂这次决定参加现场体力劳动的青年技术人员，绝大部分是两、三年前从中等技术学校和大学毕业的，共二十七人，占全厂现有技术人员57％略多一些。在这前几天，有五名分配到这个厂工作的刚从大学和中等技术学校毕业的学生，也在现场当上了生产工人。
    这种大胆的打破传统的措施，是在最近整风期间采取的。在这以前，像我国其他许多企业一样，这个厂的青年技术人员，绝大部分都缺乏实际生产经验。他们一走出学校的大门，就当上了指导现场实际生产的技术干部。
    在这批技术人员正式宣布当工人的当天，一个叫梁鸾坤的女技术员对记者说，她从1952年在一个中等技术学校毕业以后，就被分配到这个厂做管理工作，最初做些审核工人划的图纸之类的工作，以后又担负处理合理化建议的工作。她说：“由于自己没有实际生产经验，到现场眼花缭乱，很难发现问题，即使发现了问题也不知怎样解决。因此，也就不愿到现场去，结果越来越脱离实际，自己非常苦恼。”她深深体会到：书本上的知识必须同实际生产经验结合起来，才能发挥作用。她曾多次要求领导方面允许她到现场参加生产；但是，直到这次整风，她的要求才得到批准。
    记者在厂长办公室遇到了一群即将到现场参加体力劳动的青年技术人员。他们都谈到了和梁鸾坤类似的体验。1955年秋天从一个纺织学校毕业的李庆波说：“我很羡慕苏联专家，他们到现场，脱下西服，拿起工具，就能干起来，真解决问题！要想做一个既有技术理论又有实际经验的技术干部，非先当工人不可！”
    最近才从大学毕业、已经在现场当了几天工人的宋宝文说：“我这次当工人虽然才几天，可是自己却感到学到许多书本上找不到的东西。从短短的几天中，我感到我是走了一条正确的道路！”
    据工厂负责人说，这个厂的青年技术人员，绝大部分都是在他们从学校来到这里以后就分配做管理工作的。由于他们缺乏实际生产经验和工人阶级感情，很难深入现场解决实际问题；他们自己也因为得不到实际锻炼和技术上的提高，而感到苦恼。这次整风中，许多职工提出了精简管理机构的意见，不少青年技术人员也要求从当工人做起，来提高自己的技术水平。根据边整边改的方针，这个厂决定精简管理机构，并且把可以从管理岗位抽下来的、缺乏实际经验的青年技术人员，放到现场参加实际生产。
    负责人还说，这批具有一定技术理论的青年人参加体力劳动以后，将从老工人那里学到丰富的实际经验；而老工人又会从这批青年人那里学到技术理论。这样，全厂的技术水平将普遍得到提高。
