Later, he served as Chairman of the Power and Fuel Commission and Chairman of the National Economic Planning Commission. After the reorganization of the Yugoslav government under the new constitution in 1953, Vukmanović became Vice Chairman of the Federal Executive Council, a position he holds to this day. He has been elected as a member of the Federal National Assembly since 1945. He is also a member of the Central Executive Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, an executive member of the Socialist Alliance of Working People of Yugoslavia, and an executive member of the Yugoslav Veterans' Federation.
