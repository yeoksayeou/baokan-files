　　Don't Relax
    During the Great Blooming and Great Contending, the masses put forward many good and correct opinions. These opinions should be accepted with an open mind and corrected resolutely and quickly. However, the five fingers are not all the same length, and not every single opinion is correct or in line with the actual situation. These incorrect opinions, or those that are correct but cannot be implemented at present, should be explained, and should not be accepted in a generalized way without analysis.

    However, some comrades are now losing their heads in the face of the masses' magnificent criticism, forgetting the principles of rectification. Instead of humbly correcting the incorrect things about themselves and adhering to the correct ones, they comply with and yield to even incorrect opinions. For example, some people are clearly not sick, but are given sick leave slips; some products are clearly substandard, but are given certificates of conformity.

    Doing so not only damages the interests of the state and the collective; but also, because of this unprincipled attitude, the spearhead of the masses' criticism will still be directed at him.

　　松不得
    在大鸣大放中间，群众提了许许多多好的正确的意见，对这些意见，应当虚心接受，坚决地迅速地改正。但是，五个手指不一般齐，全部意见当中也不能条条都对，都符合实际情况。对这些不正确或虽然正确但目前还行不通的意见，应当加以解释，而不能不加分析地笼统接受。
    但是，现在有些同志却在群众气势磅礴的批评面前，弄昏了头脑，忘记了整风的原则，他们不是虚心地去改正自己身上那些不正确的东西，坚持那些正确的，而是对不正确的意见也顺从、迁就。例如，有的人明明没有病，也给签了病假条子，有的产品明明不合格，也给签了合格证。
    这样做，不但损害了国家的、集体的利益；而且由于采取了这种无原则的态度，群众的批评的矛头仍然会戳到他身上来。
