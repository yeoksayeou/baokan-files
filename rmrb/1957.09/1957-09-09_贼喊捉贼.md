"Stop thief!"
    Huaxia

Jiang Feng said it so beautifully and self-importantly: that this person doesn't want politics, that person only wants tradition and not revolution. It was as if he was the only one who truly wanted politics and revolution.

Wasn't it also when he was most rampant in attacking the Party that he raised a great hue and cry about the political education of higher education institutions? He said: "The biggest pressure this year is political study," that "political education cannot be carried out"; he also said: "Students don't want politics anymore," and even said that the "professional first, red later" ideology of senior intellectuals is quite serious, and that "some veteran cadres are also unwilling to do administrative work." Finally, he even shouted: "We cannot cultivate young people to oppose us!" According to Jiang Feng, the situation was indeed serious. But where is the root cause? According to him, it was the result of the "many right-leaning" thoughts produced after the Party advocated "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend"; it was the result of the leadership "not paying attention to political and ideological education"; he even said that it was the result of the Party's "Eighth National Congress" resolution not emphasizing class struggle(?). Jiang Feng not only once again made extremely malicious slanders against the Party, but also arrogantly boasted that he was even more brilliant than the Party's "Eighth National Congress." Jiang Feng's "politics" can truly be said to have reached its peak.

However, fire cannot be contained in paper, and corpses cannot be hidden in snow. It turns out that it was Jiang Feng himself who didn't want revolutionary political and ideological education, and it was also Jiang Feng himself who put "the greatest pressure" on the political study of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, making political education "impossible"; it was Jiang Feng who encouraged "Party and League members to paint and study business every day" and were unwilling to do social work; it was Jiang Feng who advocated "professional first, red later," said that "politics is outdated," and did not want to do administrative work; even, it was Jiang Feng who colluded with "artists" nurtured by the Party who then turned ungrateful to attack the Party.

Because Jiang Feng neglected politics, the Central Academy of Fine Arts has long had serious non-political tendencies such as "teaching skills but not people" and "teaching technology but not caring about ideology." In 1955, the "Fine Arts" monthly magazine published criticism articles on this. However, at that time, Jiang Feng seemed to only "neglect" political education; anyway, there were still political classes, and students' thoughts were still considered to be managed. However, since last year, Jiang Feng has changed from so-called neglect of political education to hostility towards political education. Because since last year, he has openly advocated that political classes are not needed and students' thoughts should not be managed. He said: "Art schools mainly study art, political classes are not necessary," "The main requirement in school is to do well in creation, and students can manage their own thoughts." He believed that political classes and ideological education could be solved by students "reading books themselves." In the second half of last year, he started to cancel "History of the Chinese Revolution." He said: "'History of the Chinese Revolution' doesn't have much to talk about." His "theory" is "Politics, if you don't learn it now, you can learn it in the future, take your time, now students mainly focus on their profession in school," "If your profession is not good, the masses don't want you, and the leaders don't want you either," "You can paint well even without Marxism-Leninism." In addition, he treated political teachers coldly and ridiculed them, and dozed off in the classroom when listening to political teachers' trial lectures, etc.

Please see, who exactly is Jiang Feng, who is full of "revolution," revolutionizing? On the one hand, he wants to eradicate political education from the school, and on the other hand, he shouts that "political education cannot be carried out." Isn't Jiang Feng's intention clear?

In fact, Jiang Feng knows that the Party attaches importance to political and ideological education. The problem is that Jiang Feng is no longer neglecting this importance, but is hostile to this importance; it is even like this: the more the Party values it, the more hostile he becomes; the more the Party wants to strengthen political education, the more he wants to eradicate political education. This is the truth about Jiang Feng's attitude towards political education. If anyone still says that he attaches importance to political education, then it can only be anti-Party and anti-socialist politics, and nothing else.

The truth is now out. It turns out that Jiang Feng is a "domestic thief" wearing a revolutionary cloak, and his cries at the "People's Congress" are just his final struggle—"stop thief!"

    “贼喊捉贼”
    华夏
    江丰神气活现地说得多漂亮：什么这个人不要政治，那个人又只要传统不要革命啦。好像真正要政治、要革命的只有他了。
    就在他向党进攻得最猖狂的时候，不是又拿高等院校的政治教育这个题目来大喊大叫了一阵么。他说：“这一年来最大压力是政治学习”，“政治教育无法进行”了；又说：“学生不要政治了”，还说：高级知识分子“先专后红”的思想相当厉害，“一些老干部也不愿做行政工作”了。最后他还大叫：“我们不能培养青年出来反对我们！”照江丰说来，情况实在是严重了。可是根源何在呢？据他说，是党提倡“百花齐放，百家争鸣”之后，产生了“许多右倾”思想的结果；是领导上“没有重视政治思想教育”的结果；甚至还说这是党的“八大”决议没有强调阶级斗争（？）的结果。江丰不仅仅又一次对党进行了极为恶毒的污蔑，而且居然狂妄地把自己吹得比党的“八大”还要高明了，江丰的“政治”真可以说是登峰造极了。
    可是，纸里包不住火，雪地里藏不住死尸。原来，不要革命的政治思想教育的正是江丰自己，给中央美术学院的政治学习以“最大压力”使政治教育“无法进行”的也是江丰自己；怂恿“党、团员天天画画学业务”而不愿做社会工作的是江丰，主张“先专后红”，说“政治过时了”和不想做行政工作的也是江丰，甚至，纠合党所哺育成人而后又忘恩负义的“艺术家”来向党进攻的也是江丰。
    由于江丰忽视政治，中央美术学院长期存在“教书不教人”“教技术不管思想”等严重的非政治倾向。1955年“美术”月刊上为此曾发表过批评文章。不过，那时候的江丰，对政治教育似乎还只是“忽视”而已，反正政治课还是有的，学生的思想也还是认为要管的。可是，从去年以来，江丰却从所谓对政治教育的忽视一变而为对政治教育的敌视了。因为他从去年以来，竟公然主张不要政治课和不管学生的思想了。他这样说：“艺术学校主要就是学艺术，政治课可以不要”，“在学校主要要求把创作搞好，思想可以让学生自己管”。他认为政治课和思想教育都可以让学生“自己去看看书”来解决。去年下半年他就下手取消了“中国革命史”。他说：“‘中国革命史’没有什么好讲的”。他的“理论”是“政治嘛，现在不学将来可以学，慢慢来，现在学生在学校里主要是抓业务”，“业务不好，群众不要，领导也不要你了”，“不要马列主义也能画好画”。此外，他对政治教员们冷淡嘲笑，在听政治教员试讲的课堂上打瞌睡，……等等。
    请看，满口“革命”的江丰，究竟在革谁的命？一方面要把政治教育从学校连根拔掉，而另一方面却又喊“政治教育无法进行”。江丰的用心，难道还不明白么？
    其实，党对政治思想教育的重视，江丰是知道的。问题是江丰已经不再是对这种重视的忽视，而是对这种重视的敌视了；甚至是这样：党愈重视，他就愈加敌视；党要加强政治教育，他却要把政治教育连根拔掉。这就是江丰对待政治教育的真相。如果还有人说他是重视政治教育的话，那就只能是反党反社会主义的政治，而不是别的。
    这就真相大白了。原来江丰是披着革命外衣的“家贼”，他在“人大”的喊叫，不过是他的最后的挣扎——“贼喊捉贼”而已。
