Growing in Battle
——Communist Youth League Member Wu Yunyu Who Persisted in the Anti-Rightist Struggle

　　Wu Yunyu, a Communist Youth League member and freshman in the medical department of Chengdu College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, adhered to the socialist stance in the anti-Rightist struggle and waged an irreconcilable struggle against the Rightists, demonstrating the excellent qualities of a Communist Youth League member.
    Wu Yunyu not only waged a head-on, intense struggle against the Rightists, but also encouraged the students around her not to compromise with them. At that time, the Rightists in the college launched various personal attacks on her in their reactionary publications, and even sent people to monitor her. However, Wu Yunyu did not waver in the slightest. She continued to reason with the Rightists and expose their conspiracy to attack the Party by using "strikes" and "exam boycotts".
    Wu Yunyu's spirit of upholding the truth and persisting in struggle has won the support of her classmates, and has recently been commended by the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League.

　　在战斗中成长
　　——坚持反右派斗争的共青团员吴蕴玉
    成都中医学院共青团员、医疗系一年级学生吴蕴玉，在反右派斗争中坚持社会主义立场，和右派分子进行了不调和的斗争，表现了共青团员的优秀品质。
    吴蕴玉不仅对右派分子作正面的、剧烈的斗争，而且鼓励周围同学不要和他们妥协。当时学院中的右派分子在他们办的反动刊物上对她进行各种人身攻击，甚至还派人监视她。但是吴蕴玉丝毫没有动摇，她继续和右派分子进行说理斗争，并揭露了他们用“罢课”“罢考”向党进攻的阴谋。
    吴蕴玉的这种维护真理、坚持斗争的精神，得到同学的支持，最近并受到共青团四川省委员会的表扬。
