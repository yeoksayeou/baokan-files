The struggle to criticize the Ding Ling and Chen Qixia anti-Party clique is a principled major struggle in literary and art circles. The essence of this struggle is the reflection of class struggle outside the Party within the Party during the period of socialist revolution.

The central issue of the struggle is to defend the socialist direction of literary and art undertakings and consolidate the Party's leadership, and to solve the problem of long-standing anti-Party activities within the Party in literary and art circles. This struggle must also be a struggle between two lines of literary and artistic thought. Chen Qixia said that if their small group had a common ideological program, it would be two things: first, doubting the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers; and second, despising the works of the liberated areas; in particular, Ding Ling's "one-bookism" thought is a typical decadent bourgeois literary thought, that is, Lenin's so-called "bourgeois literary positionism and individualism." These are things that are incompatible with the Party's literary and artistic thought, and it is precisely the ideological basis for their anti-Party activities. Precisely because their literary and artistic thought and world outlook are incompatible with the Party, they feel that the Party is hindering them everywhere, restricting them, and they find it very annoying. When this contradiction develops to a certain extent, it will combine to form anti-Party activities. At this time, it is no longer just a disagreement and confrontation on ideological principles, but has developed into a disagreement and confrontation on organization. It is no longer just a problem of factionalism within the Party, but a problem of an anti-Party clique.

The struggle between the two lines of literary and artistic thought is a long-term struggle, and it is only the beginning now. In fact, since the Hungarian incident last year, revisionist thought has greatly developed in Chinese literary and art circles. This is a historical background that has caused the Ding Chen group to attack. Ideological problems are related to political problems, and ideological differences will develop into political differences. Regarding the issue of literary and artistic thought, I suggest that a national debate continue after the meeting. This debate can continue for as long as ten or eight years, to develop Marxist literary and artistic thought from the debate. In this struggle, first thoroughly smash this anti-Party clique within the Party, improve the Party spirit of literature from the struggle, oppose the bourgeois literary direction, and put the relationship between the Party and literature and art in the correct position. Without this condition, the construction of socialist literature is impossible.

    A Great Conspiracy to Oppose Party Leadership
    and Split Literary and Art Circles

The exposure of the Ding Ling, Chen Qixia, and Feng Xuefeng anti-Party clique may seem surprising and sudden to people in society who do not understand the truth about literary and art circles, but this is by no means accidental. These people's anti-Party thoughts have their historical origins and common foundations. Ding Ling had already betrayed and surrendered to the enemy in Nanjing in 1933, and published the anti-Party article "Thoughts on March 8th" in Yan'an. Chen Qixia was already her loyal collaborator at this time. Feng Xuefeng carried out activities to split the Party as early as the "Left League" era, and later once voluntarily left the Party. This group also includes some people who have always been dissatisfied with the Party and politically wavering to the point of betraying it. This shows that in these people, anti-Party thoughts are like leavening agents, brewing for a long time, and when their personal ambitions and the interests of the Party cannot be reconciled, they will inevitably combine to attack the Party.

This group has launched several attacks on the Party since liberation, and especially after the Hungarian incident last year, a kind of political illusion prompted them to start another fierce attack. It is worth pointing out here that although the Hungarian incident did not cause political fluctuations among the Chinese people, it did have a strong impact on some intellectuals with anti-Party thoughts. This is not to say that Ding Ling, Chen Qixia, Feng Xuefeng, etc., explicitly approved of the Hungarian rebels, but that, in a kind of class instinct, they consciously or unconsciously sympathized with those writers who betrayed the Party. Therefore, Chen Qixia said after the Hungarian incident: "The current atmosphere is favorable to us," and Feng Xuefeng also expressed sympathy for Fast's betrayal of the Party. In fact, it was after this incident that this once-criticized group reunited, and all kinds of rumors became active again. And during the period of great airing of views, the blind and erroneous political situation estimate overwhelmed their minds, they thought the time had come, so they turned to open attack. But the result was the same as with many rightists, they exposed all their conspiracies in this blind optimistic estimate.

I am not here to repeat the materials exposed in the newspapers and at the meeting, but from these materials, it can be seen that this is a not-small conspiracy, this conspiracy is planned and step-by-step, its main content is: 1. Oppose the leadership of the Party; 2. Split the unity of literary and art circles; 3. Establish an anti-Party literary and artistic ideological base.

Their offensive strategy is just like the eight characters confessed by Chen Qixia at the meeting: "Attack, can't attack, split!" Their attack is also coordinated in two aspects: on the one hand, uniting forces within the Party to expand the influence of the group, and launching attacks from Party meetings; on the other hand, colluding with the rightists of Wenhui Daily and Literary Gazette to exert pressure from the outside, attempting to publicly expose the so-called "Ding Chen problem" as a "factional crackdown" in the newspapers. In order to protect them, the Party did not publicly announce their anti-Party crimes to the society after criticizing them the year before, and they just used the Party's certain protection of them to launch a coordinated attack on the Party from within and without, attempting to use the social masses' ignorance of the truth to give the Party a blow.

But they know that it is not easy to oppose the leadership of the Party, so the more important and more vicious move in their anti-Party conspiracy is their splitting activities. They were preparing to create a big split at the October Literary Congress. Ding Ling was prepared to publish a statement in the meeting declaring her withdrawal from the Writers Association, Chen Qixia had already written his "Farewell to Literary and Art Circles," and other members of the anti-Party group were prepared to respond and withdraw from literary and art circles. And according to recent exposure of materials, Jiang Feng in the art world was also prepared to announce his withdrawal from the Artists Association at the Literary Congress. This is indeed a powerful momentum. They thought they were leading figures in literary and art circles, "great writers," and they had the masses. Therefore, this action will give literary and art circles a heavy blow. But will the facts be like that? An American Fast, isn't this writer world famous, what happened when he withdrew from the American Communist Party? Did the American Communist Party split? Was the international socialist literary camp affected? Individualists always overestimate the role of the individual too much, and underestimate the role of the masses and the Party too little. The fact is that no matter what great writer, when he leaves the people and leaves the Party, he has nothing. This is called cutting oneself off from the Party and cutting oneself off from the people.

Naturally, they can also have reason to say that a member has the legal right to withdraw from the Writers Association. There is no doubt that you have this legal right. But is the matter really that simple? At the same time as their splitting activities, they were also preparing to establish their own anti-Party literary and artistic base—that is, the secret preparation of a coterie publication led by Feng Xuefeng.

Coterie publications are not impossible to run. This was explained at the journal editorial meeting of the Writers Association last year. In order to implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, the Writers Association approves the development of various different styles and schools of literature on the basis of a common socialist ideology. The difference between a school and a sect is that the former refers to a literary group combined by certain writers with similar literary styles on the basis of a common ideology. In our literary history, such as Lu Xun's "Yu Si," Guo Moruo's "Creation," and Mao Dun's "Fiction Monthly," are all examples of developing this kind of school, and they all serve the people. Sects are an unprincipled combination for the purpose of achieving certain political goals or personal interests. Hu Feng's "July" and "Hope" belong to this category. Which category does the coterie publication secretly prepared by the Ding, Chen, and Feng anti-Party group belong to? Feng Xuefeng and Chen Yong, who jointly organized it, both admitted that their literary and artistic thought is anti-Marxist and contradicts Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy. Their "coterie" list also includes Ding Ling, Liu Binyan, Wang Ruowang, and others. May I ask these writers, apart from being consistent in anti-Party thought, what aspects show that their literary styles are the same?

Because of this, they have to secretly plan behind the backs of the Party and the Presidium of the Writers Association. What is especially clear is that the secret preparation of this publication is precisely when they launched a major attack on the Literary Gazette. Among the four "coterie members" who prepared this coterie publication, one is the former editor-in-chief of the Literary Gazette, one is the current editorial board member of the Literary Gazette, and two are the director and deputy director of the general editorial office. Then, isn't the purpose of this publication very clear? It is to bring down the Literary Gazette led by the Party and establish another anti-Marxist literary and artistic base.

In literary and artistic thought, we adhere to the policy of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" and welcome open theoretical debates, but the Writers Association has no reason to allow the creation of such an anti-Marxist coterie publication. In socialist society, the literary movement must maintain its unity and solidarity. This is a fundamental principle. And now the Ding and Chen group is precisely trying to split this unity and solidarity of the literary and artistic front and destroy the socialist direction of literature. This is a big conspiracy, and every comrade in literary and art circles must absolutely not tolerate this conspiracy!

    The Absurd Propaganda of the Ding Chen Anti-Party Group Must Be Clarified

Ding Ling, Chen Qixia, and others have used the fact that the Party has not publicly criticized their anti-Party words and deeds in the newspapers in the past to spread a lot of rumors and provocative propaganda attacking the Party among the masses; this propaganda has indeed confused some people who do not know the truth, and some people who lack principle have even echoed and supported it. Among their provocative propaganda, a question of understanding the relationship with the Party is involved, which is also one of the fundamental questions to be solved in this struggle. Therefore, it must be thoroughly clarified to distinguish between right and wrong.

First of all, this anti-Party group, like other anti-Party people, does not dare to publicly admit that they are opposing the Party. In order to cover up their faces, they always first describe the Party's leading organs or certain leading comrades as a "faction," and then describe the Party's criticism of them as a kind of "factional crackdown." They said, "There is a group of people in the Party who are specialized in rectifying people, and there is a group who are specialized in being rectified." Ding Ling said, "Zhou Yang has ruled the literary and art circles for more than 20 years," meaning that this is a kind of "factional rule." But this statement is consistent with Hu Feng's. The main attack on the Party in Hu Feng's 300,000-word letter is this "factional rule." Hu Feng also said in a secret letter to Fang Ran: "We must gradually grasp that this is a persecution of factionalism." Why do Ding Ling and Hu Feng adopt such a common language? This is not surprising at all. Because when the bourgeoisie attacks the leadership of the Party, it always adopts a common formula. This formula is "factionalism" or "factional rule." In the above-mentioned secret letter from Hu Feng, the People's Daily editor added an editor's note saying: "Sect, our ancestors called it 'partisanship,' and now people call it 'circle' or 'stall.' We are very familiar with it. People who do this kind of thing often say that others have factions in order to achieve their political goals." The Ding and Chen group is naturally no exception.

This so-called "faction" statement is not only held by the Ding and Chen group, but also by some confused people and people who lack Party spirit. Didn't someone write an article in a publication saying something about "manufacturing and savoring the coma and violence of pain"? Therefore, it is necessary to clarify what is called "factionalism within the Party."

Comrade Mao Zedong made it very clear in "Rectifying the Party's Style." Factionalism "first of all is to make independence." He also said, "People who make this kind of independence are often inseparable from their personal firstism. They are often incorrect in the relationship between the individual and the Party. Although they also say that they respect the Party in words, in practice they put the individual first and the Party second. Comrade Liu Shaoqi once said that there is a kind of person whose hands are particularly long and who is very good at planning for himself, but he does not care much about the interests of others and the interests of the whole Party. 'What is mine is mine, and what is yours is still mine.' What are these people doing? Seeking fame, seeking status, seeking to be in the limelight. When they are in charge of a part of the cause, they will make independence. For these, they will win over some people, exclude some people, blow and flatter among comrades, pull and pull, and move the vulgar style of the bourgeoisie into the Communist Party."

Isn't it very clear when we read this passage? Who is making independence to the Party? Who puts the individual first and the Party second? Who is seeking fame, seeking status, seeking to be in the limelight? Who is blowing and flattering among comrades, pulling and pulling? Isn't this a portrayal of this anti-Party group? And their making independence to the Party has exceeded the scope of factionalism and developed to the point of opposing the Party. We can criticize any comrade, including leading comrades. If there are shortcomings and mistakes, we should criticize them. Not criticizing is without principle. But criticism should stand on the Party's position, point out the Party's principles, and there should never be personal attacks or behind-the-back slanders among comrades. We have all kinds of shortcomings and mistakes in our work; we welcome comrades' criticism and we must constantly overcome our shortcomings in the rectification movement. But in the relationship with the Party, we always strive to implement the Party's line and obey the Party's decisions. The shortcoming is that we have not implemented it well enough. These anti-Party elements often attack us with words like "following the leadership line." Comrade Ding Ling herself also said that some comrades only see the Central Committee. What's wrong with having the Central Committee in mind? What's wrong with acting according to the Central Committee's line? How can it become a "faction" and carry out a "factional crackdown"? Isn't this refuting oneself?

For more than 30 years, there have been many principled struggles and some unprincipled disputes in China's literary and art movement. The difference between the nature of these struggles lies in whether it is a struggle to maintain the Party's principles and oppose harm to the Party's principles, or a struggle for the interests of private factions or groups. Let us review the struggles we have waged against Ding Ling, Chen Qixia, etc., in recent years, such as the issue of literary and art criticism at the Second Literary Congress, the issue of checking the errors of the Literary Gazette in 1954, and the issue of criticizing Ding Ling and Chen Qixia's anti-Party activities the year before. Aren't they all struggles to maintain the Party's principles? Then, the so-called "factional crackdown" slander is self-evident.

Ding Ling, Chen Qixia, etc., not only fabricated this slander and attacked the Party's leading comrades in literary and art circles, but also slandered the Central Committee for "listening to only one side" like the rightists. Everyone knows that the Party Central Committee is not only not isolated from the situation in literary and art circles, but also sees it more clearly and farther than the comrades in literary and art circles. The criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun," the criticism of the problem of "Dream of the Red Chamber," and the struggle against the Hu Feng group were all put forward by the Central Committee. It is precisely under the correct leadership of the Central Committee that our literary and art movement can adhere to the Marxist direction under the attacks of various bourgeois thoughts. The Party is serious, and the Party cannot allow anti-Marxist idealist thought to erode the literary and art ranks, let alone allow anti-Party thought to grow within the Party. On such principled issues, the Party Central Committee's political sense is more acute and stronger than anyone else, and it is more serious in dealing with such issues than anyone else, while we often make mistakes of sentimentalism and liberalism. Ding Ling, Chen Qixia, etc., completely disregard the leadership of the Party. Their malicious propaganda also truly reflects their own dark psychology towards the Party. They not only distrust certain leading comrades, but also distrust the entire Party and the Party Central Committee. Under this dark psychology, how can they not oppose the Party?

Secondly, they deliberately lowered the Party's serious ideological struggle to the issue of people versus people. They said that we are only opposing certain comrades, not opposing the Party. They even pretended to be very reasonable and said, are certain comrades the Party? It should be pointed out that this is a very unprincipled and extremely sinister statement. This is the so-called strategy of "please kill Chao Cuo to clear the emperor's side." Hu Feng used this strategy. Now the Ding Chen group is still following this tradition. And some people are echoing precisely because these people do not look at the problem from the Party's principles, so they are confused by this provocative propaganda.

Individualist intellectuals often look at problems from a personal perspective. They regard personal will as absolute and the Party as abstract. Therefore, they only see individuals in the Party and cannot see the Party's collective organization. They completely reversed the relationship between the individual and the collective. Ding Ling and Xuefeng have both said such things: "The Party is on their side" or "The Party is in their hands." As if the Party is a tool of power that can be manipulated in the hands of this or that Party member. This is actually a sordid idea of the bourgeoisie fighting for power and profit, and it is precisely this sordid idea that makes them regard the Party's serious ideological struggle as an attack on individuals, and use the name of opposing individuals to carry out anti-Party conspiracies.

In their malicious propaganda, they always depict the ideological struggle within the Party as gloomy and terrifying, and describe the Party as very cruel, while they describe themselves as very pitiful and aggrieved. Ding Ling said, "I am a person who came out of the tomb," "a person who was beaten to death with one stick," "a poor peasant," "a proletariat who has nothing." They are good at using a lot of literary language to render themselves as "persecuted" people, because they know from their literary habits that "persecuted" people are easy to gain people's sympathy, and from this unprincipled sympathy, they can show themselves as "suffering heroes." However, this selfish behavior is precisely the so-called "heroization of the 'humiliated and injured' philistine" that Gorky deeply hated.

Among them, there are also some people who clamor that there is no freedom and no warmth in the Party. Naturally, for some extreme individualists, even if the Party gives them the greatest freedom, it cannot satisfy them. Because what they demand is that absolute freedom. Regarding this "freedom," I might as well still quote a passage from Gorky. He said: "Yes, I am against freedom, starting from such a boundary, exceeding this boundary, freedom becomes indulgence, and everyone knows that the beginning of this change lies in a person losing the knowledge of his true social and cultural value, and letting the hidden, old philistine individualism in him develop widely. Crying out: 'I am so wonderful, unique, and irreplaceable, but I am not allowed to live according to my own will.' It is good if he only cries out, because when he really acts according to his own will, he will become a counter-revolutionary on the one hand and a rogue on the other, which is almost of equal value—despicable and harmful." (Gorky: "The Philistine")

Isn't this still not worth vigilance? For a long time, a harmful atmosphere of liberalism has been quite widespread in literary and art circles. This is the breeding ground for anti-Party thought, and it is also the reason why the absurd propaganda of the Ding Chen anti-Party group can gain a certain market. In this atmosphere, the relationship between Party members and the Party and the relationship between literature and art and the Party are often placed in an incorrect relationship. This is a big problem in literary and art work. In this struggle, we must thoroughly criticize this incorrect view of the Party and correctly solve the relationship between the Party and literature and art according to Lenin's principles.

    The Ideological Roots of the Anti-Party Thoughts of Ding Ling, Feng Xuefeng, and Others

Ding Ling, Feng Xuefeng, and others are all old Party members of 20 or 30 years and have made certain achievements in literature. Why has their thought degenerated to this point? People will ask such questions, and this should be explained from their ideological roots.

The most basic point is that the thought of bourgeois individualism is a prominent manifestation in intellectuals, that is, the so-called "self-centered" consciousness. Lenin once quoted a passage from Kautsky to explain this characteristic of intellectuals: Intellectuals, "his weapon is his personal knowledge, his personal ability, his personal beliefs. … Therefore, in his opinion, the complete freedom to express his personality is the primary condition for successful work. He is very reluctant to obey the whole as a subordinate part of a certain whole, and he obeys this whole out of necessity rather than out of his own will. He believes that discipline only needs to be observed by the masses, while superiors do not need to observe discipline. As for himself, of course, he puts himself in the ranks of superiors." (Lenin: "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back")

Intellectuals of this so-called "superior" type in the revolutionary ranks often regard their creations or literary achievements as completely personal things. They forget the cultivation of the revolution and the Party for them, forget that literature cannot be a "personal undertaking unrelated to the overall cause of the proletariat," but regard some of their achievements as a personal capital for the Party and the revolution. Ding Ling's "one-bookism" is the most prominent manifestation of this thought. She said to people: "Writing is for oneself, doing work is for others." This is a reflection of the so-called "private ownership in the mind." She does not write for the people, but writes to accumulate capital for herself. When they feel that this capital is getting bigger and bigger, the Party becomes smaller and smaller in their eyes. The higher their literary status and honor, the farther they are from the Party. This individualist thought is not only manifested in creative undertakings, but also in the desire for power and status. Therefore, when they control a part of the work, they always regard it as their personal territory and put personal interests above the Party's interests. Feng Xuefeng said: "When he is proud, he puts himself above the Party, and when he is frustrated, he puts himself outside the Party." This sentence is a very typical reflection of the common thought of him and Ding Ling and others. The more this self-consciousness expands, the more irreconcilable it becomes with the Party's collectivism and the Party's discipline, and the result will inevitably lead to the road of opposing the Party. This is a very natural principle.

Here, I would like to especially talk about Comrade Feng Xuefeng's thought, because I know him better, and he is a person who has participated in the revolution for a longer time and has a greater influence in the ideological field.

I came into contact with Comrade Xuefeng in 1939, exactly two years after he voluntarily left the Party. This was when the national anti-Japanese movement was rising and all revolutionary forces were approaching the Party, but Xuefeng refused the Central Committee's transfer at this time, abandoned the Party's organization, and quietly ran back to his hometown. This is difficult to understand. This reflects Xuefeng's two extreme individualist thoughts. First, he has a dark and even fearful psychology towards the Party. This psychology is on the one hand due to the dissatisfaction of the desire for power, and on the other hand due to the fact that he did not receive the training to withstand the cruel struggle of the revolution during the first domestic revolutionary period, and produced a dark suspicion of the ideological struggle within the Party. Second, he felt that the Party's collective life and organizational discipline strongly conflicted with the "complete freedom of personality" required for his creation. He demanded to get rid of this bondage and fantasized about opening up a personal future in the literary field by relying on his personal will and ability. Xuefeng very much wanted to regard himself as Lu Xun's successor. However, his path was exactly the opposite of Lu Xun's. Lu Xun took the path from fighting alone to finally engaging in collective combat before the revolutionary literary and art ranks were established, while Xuefeng retreated from collective combat to the road of fighting alone. Isn't this going against the grain? Although Lu Xun did not join the Party, Lu Xun's spirit was communist; Xuefeng joined the Party, but Xuefeng's spirit deviated from communism. Therefore, although the Party restored his organizational relationship at that time, his thought was not resolved. In 1940, his organizational relationship was lost again. I wanted him to come to Guilin, but he refused, and as a result, he was arrested by the enemy and imprisoned in the Shangrao concentration camp for two or three years without compensation.

Prison life did not strengthen Xuefeng's will to the Party and the revolution. After being released from prison, in the days in Chongqing and Shanghai, his thought continued to develop. In these long years, Xuefeng did not hold any Party work except for writing. And his ambition to "fight alone in the literary world" also became a fantasy. Because the individual is separated from the collective struggle, he is also separated from the reality created by the collective, and the free development of personality he demands is only the "self-deepening of personality towards one's own world, towards the 'I' like a microorganism" as Gorky said. Under this ideological situation, his social thought will inevitably tend to nihilism; his literary and artistic thought will also inevitably tend to idealism. In some essays written by Xuefeng during the Chongqing and Shanghai period, as Comrade He Qifang pointed out, a strong nihilistic thought was revealed. He also held a nihilistic view of the surging power of the Chinese people's revolution at that time. For example, in an essay he wrote in 1946, "Kindness" (see Volume 1 of Xuefeng's Essays), he analyzed two characteristics of the Chinese people—"kindness" and "obedience." What is the difference between this and Hu Feng's so-called "strength and kindness to bear the burden of labor" and "spirit of resignation"? Therefore, Xuefeng said: "I don't think they (referring to the people) are numb. Of course, I don't think they are in rebirth." May I ask, in 1946, if the Chinese people were not yet in the process of rebirth, then how could they have completely liberated the whole country three years later? Isn't this a thorough nihilistic view of the people?

On the basis of the idealist world outlook and the nihilistic social thought, it is only natural that Xuefeng's literary and artistic thought is consistent with Hu Feng's. I don't want to analyze Xuefeng's literary and artistic thought here. But it should be pointed out that Xuefeng emphasizes realism. However, Xuefeng's literary and artistic thought is precisely detached from reality. The biggest reality is politics, that is, the problem of 600 million people. Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" proposed that "political standard first" and "popularization first" are based on the realistic requirements in the political struggle, and Xuefeng precisely opposes these two. This shows that Xuefeng only starts from art itself in literary and art issues, not from politics and from the current objective reality of China, and therefore cannot but fall into idealism.

In Xuefeng's 30 years of participating in the revolution, one point is very prominent. That is, in every revolutionary upsurge, he personally tends to be depressed. This was the case at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, when the country was about to be liberated, and also in the upsurge of the socialist revolution. This is almost incomprehensible for a revolutionary. Naturally, I am not saying that Xuefeng has no feelings for the revolution at all, or even does not approve of it. Such a statement is also not realistic. This mood, I think, is because when the revolutionary forces are particularly strong, the self-world of individualism appears even more small and weak. Individualists are particularly sensitive to their own emptiness at such times; secondly, at such times, the dissatisfaction of a personal desire often stimulates themselves more. Xuefeng said in a letter to me before the national liberation that he "seemed to be kicked aside like a small stone." I think it is precisely a reflection of this mood. This is a subtle but very vulgar ideological manifestation of individualist intellectuals.

The longer this ideological contradiction is suppressed, the greater his emotional backlash against reality. This further promotes Xuefeng to treat the new reality with a dark psychology, thus one-sidedly exaggerating the dark side of social life and developing into a cynical attitude towards life. After the Hungarian incident, Xuefeng said to Chen Qixia, "Humanity has no hope. Does the theory of evolution work?" This most profoundly reflects the dark and reactionary thought in his heart. If humanity has no hope, then what revolution is there? What socialism is there? Xuefeng is a researcher of Lu Xun, and Lu Xun's greatest spirit is that he can go from the theory of evolution to the theory of class, precisely because he has absolute confidence in the people, in history, and in humanity. However, Xuefeng, who has followed Lu Xun for a long time, said the words "humanity has no hope." How can this be linked to the name of a Communist Party member! This not only negates the spirit of communism, but also negates the spirit of Lu Xun!

This is an anarchistic thought that has developed to the extreme. It sees no hope in reality, wants to negate everything, and wants to be detached from everything. Other anti-Party people have this thought, but as a theorist, the danger of this thought is even more profound for Xuefeng.

The problem is not in a few of them, but in their thought, which has also eroded the souls of many new generations of young people. Haven't many young people gone astray under the influence of Ding Ling, Feng Xuefeng, and Chen Qixia and others? The seriousness of the problem lies here. This is an issue related to the entire ideological field, a major ideological struggle. Without solving these problems, there will be no prosperity of literature and art, and there will be no victory of socialist literature and art. Therefore, this struggle must be firm and thorough, and must continue to deepen for a long time. In this struggle, any sentimentalism is not allowed. Every literary and art worker should receive a profound education from this struggle and thoroughly transform himself. Comrades such as Ding Ling, Feng Xuefeng, and Chen Qixia should change their past mistakes, start anew, and become new people again.

    文艺上两条路线的大斗争
    邵荃麟
    这次批判丁玲、陈企霞反党集团的斗争是文艺界一场原则性的大斗争。这个斗争的实质是社会主义革命时期党外阶级斗争在党内的反映。
    斗争的中心问题，是保卫文学事业的社会主义方向和巩固党的领导的问题，是解决文艺界党内长期存在的一个反党活动的问题。这个斗争也必然是文艺思想的两条路线的斗争。陈企霞说，他们这个小集团如果说有共同思想纲领的话，就是两条：一是怀疑工农兵方向，二是轻视解放区的作品；特别是丁玲的“一本书主义”思想，是典型的腐朽的资产阶级文艺思想，也就是列宁所说的 “资产阶级的文学上的地位主义和个人主义”。这些都是和党的文艺思想不相容的东西，也正是他们反党活动的思想基础。正因为他们文艺思想上和世界观上和党不相容，所以在工作中就会觉得党处处在妨碍他们，束缚他们，讨厌得很。这种矛盾发展到一定程度，就会结合起来形成反党的活动。到了这个时候，已经不仅仅是思想原则上的分歧与对抗，而且发展到组织上的分歧与对抗了，已经不仅仅是党内宗派主义问题，而是反党集团的问题了。
    文艺思想上两条路线的斗争，是长期性的斗争，而现在还不过是开始，事实上从去年匈牙利事件以后，修正主义思想在中国文艺界有很大的发展，这是造成丁陈集团进攻的一个历史背景。思想问题和政治问题是相联系的，思想的分歧是会发展成政治上的分歧的。对文艺思想问题，我建议在会后继续来个全国大辩论。这个辩论可以继续到十年八年之久，从辩论中来发展马克思主义的文艺思想。而在这次斗争中，则首先彻底粉碎党内这种反党集团，从斗争中提高文学的党性，反对资产阶级的文学方向，把党与文艺的关系放到正确的地位上，没有这个条件，社会主义文学的建设是不可能的。
    一个企图反对党的领导
    和分裂文艺界的大阴谋
    丁玲、陈企霞、冯雪峰反党集团的揭发，对于不明文艺界真相的社会人士，也许会感到惊奇和突然的，但这绝不是偶然的事情。这些人物的反党思想都有他们的历史渊源和共同基础的。丁玲在1933年就曾经在南京向敌人变节自首，在延安时候，又发表过反党文章“三八节有感”，而陈企霞就在这时期，已经是她忠实的合作者了；冯雪峰远在“左联”时代，就进行分裂党的活动，后来又一度自动脱党。在这个集团中间，还包括一些历来对党不满和政治上动摇以至变节分子。这说明，在这些人身上，反党思想都像发酵物似的，经过长期的酝酿，而在他们的个人野心和党的利益无法调和的时候，便必然结合起来，对党进攻。
    这个集团在解放以后，曾经几次向党进攻，而特别是去年匈牙利事件后，一种政治的幻觉促使他们开始再一次猛烈的进攻。这里值得指出的，是匈牙利事件对于中国人民群众虽然并没有引起政治上的波动，但是对于一些具有反党思想的知识分子，则确是产生了强烈的影响的。这倒并不是说，丁玲、陈企霞、冯雪峰等明确地赞成匈牙利的叛乱者，而是说，在一种阶级本能上，他们自觉或不自觉地同情了那些叛党的作家，所以陈企霞在匈牙利事件以后说：“现在的空气对我们有利了”，而冯雪峰也表示对法斯特叛党的同情。事实上，正在这事件以后，这个一度被批判的集团又重新结合起来，各种流言蜚语又活跃起来。而到了大鸣大放期间，盲目的错误的政治形势估计，冲昏了他们的头脑，他们以为时机到了，于是就转入公开的进攻。但是结果却是和许多右派分子一样，在这种盲目的乐观估计中，暴露了他们的全部阴谋。
    我不在这里来重复报上和会议上揭发的材料，但是从这些材料中间，可以看出这是一个不小的阴谋，这个阴谋是有计划有步骤的，它的主要内容是：一、反对党的领导；二、分裂文艺界的团结；三、建立反党的文艺思想阵地。
    他们进攻的战略正如陈企霞在会议上所交代的八个大字：“进攻，进攻不了，分裂！”他们的进攻又是两方面配合的：一方面在党内结合力量，扩大集团的势力，从党内会议上来发动进攻；一方面勾结文汇报和文艺报的右派分子，从外部来压迫，企图在报刊上把所谓“丁陈问题”作为一件“宗派打击”的冤案公开出来。党为了保护他们，在前年批判他们以后，没有向社会公布他们的反党罪行，而他们就恰恰利用党对他们一定的保护，向党进行了里应外合的进攻，企图利用社会群众的不明真相，给予党以打击。
    可是他们知道，要反对党的领导是并不容易的，因此他们反党阴谋中更主要，也是更毒辣的一着，是他们的分裂活动。他们准备在10月文代大会上来制造一个大分裂。丁玲准备在这个会议中登报声明退出作家协会，陈企霞则已经写好了他的“告别文艺界书”，反党集团的其他分子也准备响应，退出文艺界。而据最近揭发的材料，美术界的江丰也准备在文代大会上宣告退出美术家协会。这确实是声势浩大的。他们以为他们都是文艺界的领导人物，是“大作家”，他们是有群众的。因此这个行动将给文艺界一个沉重的打击。可是事实会是那样吗？美国一个法斯特，这个作家不是世界有名吗，他退出了美国共产党，又怎么样呢？美共分裂了没有呢？国际社会主义文学阵营影响了没有呢？个人主义者总是把个人作用估计得太大了，而把群众和党的作用估计得太小了。事实是，不管是什么大作家，当他一旦离开人民，离开党，就什么都没有了。这就叫自绝于党，自绝于人民。
    自然，他们还可以有理由说，一个会员退出作家协会是有合法权利的。毫无疑问，你们是有这种合法权利的。但是事情果然是那样单纯吗？在他们这个分裂活动的同时，他们还在准备建立一个自己的反党的文艺阵地——这就是以冯雪峰为主的秘密筹备的同人刊物。
    同人刊物并不是不能办的。去年作家协会的刊物编辑会议上就说明过这一点。为了贯彻百花齐放的政策，作家协会赞成在社会主义的共同思想基础上，发展文学上各种不同的风格和流派。所谓流派和宗派的区别，前者是指在共同思想基础上某些作家文学风格的相近而结合的文学派别，在我们文学史上如鲁迅的“语丝”，郭沫若的“创造”，茅盾的“小说月报”等，都是发展这种流派的范例，它们都是为人民服务的。而宗派则是为了达到某种政治目的或私人利益的一种无原则的结合，胡风的“七月”和“希望”是属于这类性质的。丁、陈、冯反党集团所秘密筹备的同人刊物，是属于哪一类呢？冯雪峰和他共同筹办的陈涌，都承认了他们的文艺思想是反马克思主义的，是和毛主席文艺方针相抵触的。在他们“同人”名单中，还包括丁玲，刘宾雁，王若望等人。试问这些作家，除了在反党思想上共同一致外，有什么地方表现他们文学风格上的相同呢？
    正因为这样，所以他们是不得不背着党和作家协会主席团来秘密策划。尤其明白的，是这个刊物的秘密筹备，正是他们向文艺报大举进攻的时候。筹备这个同人刊物的四位“同人”中间，一位是前文艺报的主编，一位是现任文艺报的编委，两位是总编室的正副主任。那末这个刊物的目的，不很清楚吗？就是要搞垮党所领导的文艺报，另外建立一个反马克思主义的文艺阵地。
    在文艺思想上，我们坚持“百家争鸣”的方针，欢迎理论上的公开辩论，但是作家协会绝无理由允许创办这样一个反马克思主义的同人刊物。在社会主义社会里，文学运动必须保持它的统一和团结。这是一个根本原则。而现在丁、陈集团，则正是要分裂这种文艺战线的统一和团结，要破坏文学的社会主义方向。这是一个大阴谋，文艺界的每一个同志是绝对不能容忍这种阴谋的！
    必须澄清丁陈反党集团的荒谬宣传
    丁玲、陈企霞等曾经利用过去党没有在报刊上公开批判他们的反党言行，在群众中散布了不少攻击党的流言蜚语、挑拨宣传；这些宣传，确实曾经迷惑了一部分不明真相的人，有一些缺乏原则的人，甚至加以附和与支持。在他们这些挑拨宣传中间，牵涉到一个对党的关系的认识问题，也正是这次斗争所要解决的根本问题之一。因此，必须彻底澄清，以明辨大是大非。
    首先，这个反党集团，和其他反党的人一样，不敢公然承认自己在反对党。为了掩遮他们的面目，他们总是先把党的领导机构或某些领导同人，说成是一个“宗派”，从而把党对他们的批判说成一种“宗派打击”。他们说“党内有一批人是专门整人的，有一批是专门挨整的”。丁玲说，“周扬统治了文艺界二十多年”，意思说，这是一种“宗派统治”。可是这种说法，却是和胡风一致的。胡风的三十万言上书中，攻击党最主要一条，就是这个“宗派统治”。胡风还在给方然一封密信中说“要步步抓住这是一个宗派主义的迫害”。为什么丁玲同志和胡风采取这样的共同语言呢？这一点也不奇怪。因为资产阶级在攻击党的领导的时候，总是采取一个共同公式。这公式就是“宗派主义”或“宗派统治”。就在上述胡风那封密信之后，人民日报编者加一条按语说：“宗派，我们的祖宗叫做‘朋党’，现在的人也叫做‘圈子’又叫‘摊子’，我们听得很熟的。干这种事情的人们，为了达到他们的政治目的，往往说别人有宗派。”丁、陈集团自然也并不例外。
    这种所谓“宗派”的说法，并不只丁、陈集团有，有些糊涂的人，缺乏党性的人也有，不是有人在刊物上写文章说什么“制造赏玩痛苦的昏迷与强暴”吗？所以必须讲清楚究竟什么叫做“党内宗派主义”。
    毛泽东同志在“整顿党的作风”中说得很清楚。宗派主义“首先就是闹独立性。”他又说“闹这类独立性的人，常常跟他们个人的第一主义分不开，他们在个人和党的关系问题上，往往是不正确的。他们在口头上虽然也说尊重党，但他们在实际上都是把个人放在第一位，把党放在第二位。刘少奇同志曾经说过，有一种人的手特别长，很会替自己个人打算，至于别人的利益和全党的利益，那是不大关心的。‘我的就是我的，你的还是我的。’这种人闹什么东西呢？闹名誉、闹地位、闹出风头。在他们掌管一部分事业的时候，就要闹独立性。为了这些，就要拉拢一些人，排挤一些人，在同志中间吹吹拍拍，拉拉扯扯，把资产阶级的庸俗作风搬进共产党里来了。”
    我们读一读这一段话，不是太清楚了吗？究竟是谁在向党闹独立呢？谁把个人放在第一位，把党放在第二位呢？谁在闹名誉，闹地位，闹出风头呢？谁在同志中间吹吹拍拍，拉拉扯扯呢？这不正是替这个反党集团写照吗？而且他们向党闹独立性已经超越了宗派主义的范围而发展到了反党的地步了。我们对任何同志，包括领导同志，都是可以批评的，有缺点错误就应当批评，不批评反而是没有原则。但批评应当站在党的立场，指明党的原则，同志之间决不应当有个人攻击，背后诽谤。我们在工作中有各种各样缺点错误；我们欢迎同志们批评，要在整风中不断克服我们的缺点。可是在对党的关系上，我们总是努力执行党的路线，服从党的决定的。缺点是我们执行得还不够好。这些反党分子常常总是用“走领导路线”这类的话来攻击我们，丁玲同志自己也说过，某些同志眼睛只看到中央。眼里有中央有什么不好呢？按照中央路线办事，有什么不好呢？怎么又会变成“宗派”和进行“宗派打击”呢？这岂不是自己驳倒了自己吗？
    三十多年来，我国文艺运动中，有过许多原则性的斗争，也有过一些无原则的纠纷。区别这些斗争性质的，就在看它是否维护党的原则和反对危害党的原则的斗争，还是为着私人派系或集团利益的斗争。让我们回顾一下这几年来我们对丁玲、陈企霞等所进行的斗争吧，如关于第二次文代大会对文艺批评的问题，1954年检查文艺报错误的问题，以及前年批判丁玲、陈企霞反党活动的问题，难道不都是为维护党的原则的斗争吗？那末，所谓“宗派打击”的谰言，岂不是不辩自明了。
    丁玲、陈企霞等不仅捏造这种谰言，攻击了文艺界党的领导同志，并且还和右派分子一样诬蔑了中央“偏听偏信”。谁都知道，党中央对文艺界的情况，不仅不是隔膜，而且比文艺界的同志还看得更清楚，更深远。“武训传”批判，红楼梦问题的批判，反胡风集团的斗争，不都是中央提出来的吗？正是在中央这种正确领导之下，使我们的文艺运动在各种资产阶级思想的袭击下，能够坚持马克思主义的方向。党是严肃的，党不能容许反马克思主义的唯心主义思想侵蚀文艺的队伍，当然更不能容许反党思想在党内滋长。在这样原则性问题上，党中央的政治感觉比我们任何人更敏锐，更强烈；在对待这样问题，比我们任何人更严肃，而我们倒是常常会犯温情主义自由主义的毛病。丁玲、陈企霞等完全无视党的领导，他们这种恶意的宣传，同时也确实反映了他们自己对党的阴暗心理。他们不仅对某些领导同志不信任，而且对于整个党，对于党中央也是不信任的。在这种阴暗心理之下，他们怎能不反党呢？
    其次，他们把党对于他们的严肃的思想斗争，故意贬低为人与人的问题。他们说，我们只是反对某些同志，并不是反对党。他们甚至装作很有理由的样子说，难道某些同志就是党吗？应该指出，这是一种很无原则也极阴险的说法。这就是所谓“请诛鼂错以清君侧”的策略。胡风就用过这个策略。现在丁陈集团也还是师承这个衣钵。而有些人也照样附和正是因为这些人不从党的原则上看问题，所以才被这种挑拨宣传所迷惑了。
    个人主义知识分子往往从个人角度上看问题。他们把个人的意志看作绝对的东西，把党看作是抽象的东西，因此，他们看党也只看到个人，看不见党的集体组织。他们把个人与集体的关系完全颠倒了。丁玲和雪峰都说过这样的话：“党是在他们一边的。”或者“党是在他们手里的”。仿佛党是一种权力的工具，可以操纵在这个或那个党员的手里。这实际上是一种资产阶级争权夺利的龌龊想法，而正是这种龌龊想法，使他们把党的严肃的思想斗争，看作是对个人的打击，并且假借反对个人的名义，来进行反党的阴谋。
    在他们的这种恶意的宣传中间，又总是把党内的思想斗争描写得阴森可怖，把党描写得残酷得很，而把他们自己则描写得十分可怜委曲的样子。丁玲说：“我是从坟墓里出来的人”，是“一棍子打死的人”，是“贫雇农”，是“一无所有的无产阶级”。他们善于用大堆的文学语言把自己渲染为“被迫害的”人，因为他们从文学习惯上知道“被迫害者”是容易获得人们的同情，而从这种无原则的同情中间，可以使他们显示为“受难的英雄”。然而这种自私的行为，恰恰就是高尔基所深恶痛绝的所谓“‘被屈服被侮辱的’市侩的英雄化”。
    在他们中间，还有些人叫嚷着，党内没有自由没有温暖，自然，对于一些极端个人主义者，即使是党给予他们以最大的自由，也无法使他们满足的。因为他们所要求的是那种绝对的自由。关于这种“自由”，我不妨仍然引用高尔基一段话，他说：“是的，我是反对自由，从这么一个界线起，超过这个界线，自由就变成了放纵，而大家知道的，这种变化的开始，是在于一个人丧失了对于自己的真正社会文化的价值的认识，而让他里面所暗藏着的，陈旧的市侩个人主义广泛的开展出来。叫喊着：‘我是这样美妙，别致，不可重复，然而不让我照着自己的意志生活。’还算是好的，如果他只在叫喊，因为当他真正照着自己的意志行动起来的时候，他就要一方面变成反革命者，别方面变成流氓，这差不多是同等价值的——下流和有害。”（高尔基：“市侩”）
    这还不够值得警惕吗？长期以来，在文艺界中相当广泛地流行着一种有害的自由主义的气氛。这是使反党思想得以滋长的温床，也是使丁陈反党集团的荒谬宣传能够取得一定市场的原因。在这种气氛里，党员和党的关系以及文艺和党的关系，常常被放在一种不正确的关系上。这是文艺工作上一个很大的问题。在这次斗争中，必须彻底批判这种对党的不正确观点，按照列宁的原则正确地解决党与文艺的关系。
    丁玲、冯雪峰等的反党思想根源
    丁玲、冯雪峰等都是二三十年的老党员，在文学上有一定成就，为什么思想会堕落到这样呢？人们会提出这样的问题，而这是应该从他们的思想根源上去说明的。
    最基本的一点，是资产阶级个人主义的思想在知识分子身上一种突出的表现，即所谓“自我中心”的意识。列宁曾经引用考兹基一段话来说明知识分子这种特点：知识分子，“他所用的武器就是他个人的知识，他个人的能力，他个人的信念。……因此，在他看来，表现本人个性的完全自由乃是顺利工作的首要条件。他作为某个整体底服属部分资格服从这个整体是很勉强的，是迫于必要而不是出于本人意愿来服从的。他认为纪律只有群众才需要去遵守，而上等人物则是不必遵守纪律的。至于他自己，那他当然是把自己列入上等人物的。”（列宁：“进一步，退两步”）
    革命队伍里这种所谓“上等人物”的知识分子常常把自己的创作或文学上的成就，看作是完全属于个人的东西。他们忘记革命和党对他们的培养，忘记文学不能是“与无产阶级总的事业无关的个人事业”，而却把自己的一些成就看作是对党对革命的一种个人的资本。丁玲的“一本书主义”正是这种思想的最突出的表现。她对人说：“写作是自己的，做工作是为别人的。”这就是所谓“头脑里的私有制”的反映。她并不是为人民去写作，而是为个人积累资本去写作。当他们觉得这种资本愈大的时候，党在他们的眼里便愈小，他们在文学上的地位荣誉愈高的时候，便离党愈远。这种个人主义思想，不仅表现在创作事业上，也表现在权力和地位的欲望上。因此当他们掌握一部分工作的时候，总是把它看作个人的地盘，把个人利益放在党的利益之上。冯雪峰说：“他在得意时，把自己放在党之上，在失意时把自己放在党之外。”这句话是很典型地反映了他和丁玲等人的共同思想。这种自我意识愈加扩张，便和党的集体主义，党的纪律愈来愈不能调和，其结果便必然走向反党的道路。这是很自然的道理。
    这里，我想特别谈一谈冯雪峰同志的思想，因为我比较了解他，而且他是一个参加革命更久，而在思想领域内也比较更有影响的人。
    我接触雪峰同志是在1939年，正是他自动脱党以后的两年。这是全国抗日运动高涨，一切革命力量都向党靠拢的时候，而雪峰却在这个时候，拒绝了中央的调遣，抛弃了党的组织，悄悄地跑回家乡去了。这是很难教人理解的。这里是反映了雪峰的两种极端个人主义的思想。第一，他对党存着一种阴暗的甚至是戒惧的心理，这种心理一方面是由于权力欲望的不满足，一方面是由于在第一次国内革命时期中，他没有能得承受起革命的残酷斗争的锻炼，对于党内思想斗争，产生一种阴暗的疑惧心理，第二，他感到党的集体生活和组织纪律对于他创作所要求的“完全的个性自由”发生强烈的抵触。他要求摆脱这种羁束，幻想凭个人的意志与能力在文学事业上开辟个人的前途。雪峰是很想把自己作为鲁迅的继承者的。但是，他的道路恰恰和鲁迅相反。鲁迅是在革命文艺队伍还没有建立起来以前，从孤军奋斗而终于走向集体战斗的道路，而雪峰则是从集体战斗中，退回到孤军奋斗的路上去。这不是反其道而行之吗？鲁迅虽然没有参加党，但是鲁迅的精神是共产主义的；雪峰参加了党，但雪峰的精神却是背离了共产主义的。因此虽然在当时党恢复他的组织关系，但是他的思想并未解决。1940年，他的组织关系又失掉了。我要他来桂林，他又拒绝，结果却遭受敌人逮捕，无代价的在上饶集中营被囚禁了两三年。
    监狱生活并没有把雪峰对党对革命的意志锻炼得坚强。出狱以后，在重庆和上海的日子里，他那种思想却继续发展着。在这悠长的年月里，雪峰除了写作以外，没有担任任何党的工作。而他那种企图在文学上“独打天下”的雄心，结果也成为空想。因为个人脱离了集体的战斗，也就脱离了集体所创造的现实，而他所要求的那种个性的自由发展，只是像高尔基所说的“个性向着自己的世界‘自我深入’，向着微生物似的‘我’”而已。在这种思想情况下，他的社会思想必然会趋向于虚无主义；他的文艺思想也必然会趋向于唯心主义。雪峰在重庆和上海时期所写的一些杂文中，有如何其芳同志所指出的，是流露出浓重的虚无主义的思想。他对于当时汹涌澎湃的中国人民革命的力量，也是怀着虚无主义的看法的。例如1946年他所写的一篇杂文“善良”（见雪峰论文集第一卷）中，他分析中国人民的两个特征——“善良”和“顺从”。这和胡风所谓“承受劳动重负的坚强与善良”与“安命精神”有什么分别呢？因此，雪峰说：“我不以为他们（指人民）已经麻木。我当然也不以为他们已经在新生中。”试问，在1946年，中国人民还没有在新生的过程中，那么怎么可能在三年以后就彻底解放了全国呢？这不是一种彻头彻尾对于人民的虚无主义观点吗？
    在唯心主义的世界观和虚无主义的社会思想基础上，雪峰的文艺思想和胡风趋于一致是很自然的事情。我不想在这里来分析雪峰的文艺思想。但是应该指出一点，就是雪峰是强调现实主义的。然而雪峰的文艺思想恰恰是脱离现实的。最大的现实就是政治，就是六亿人口的问题，毛泽东同志的延安文艺座谈会讲话中提出的“政治标准第一”和“普及第一”正是根据政治斗争中现实的要求，而雪峰恰是反对这两条。这说明雪峰在文艺问题上，只是从艺术的本身出发，而不是从政治出发，从当前中国的客观实际出发，因而不能不陷入于唯心主义。
    在雪峰的三十年参加革命生活中，有一点是很突出的。就是在每一次革命高潮到来的时候，他个人往往是消沉的。抗日战争开始时如此，全国快近解放时如此，而在社会主义革命高潮中也如此。这对于一个革命者来说是几乎不可理解的事。自然，我并不是说，雪峰对于革命完全没有感情，或甚至不赞成。这样说法也是不实事求是的。这种心境，我以为是，由于革命力量特别强大的时候，个人主义那种自我世界就更显得渺小无力了。个人主义者在这样的时候就特别会敏感到自己的空虚；其次，在这种时候，一种个人欲望的不满足，往往会更刺激自己。雪峰在全国解放前给我的信中说到他“好像一块小石子被踢到一旁似的”。我以为正是这种心境的反映。这是个人主义知识分子一种微妙的然而却是很庸俗的思想表现。
    这种思想矛盾，被压抑得愈久，他对于现实的情感的反拨也愈大。这就更促进雪峰用阴暗的心理去对待新的现实，因而片面地夸大了社会生活的阴暗面，发展成一种愤世嫉俗的人生态度。在匈牙利事件以后，雪峰对陈企霞说“人类没有希望。进化论行不行？”这是最深刻地反映了他内心里那种阴暗和反动的思想。人类都没有希望，还要革什么命呢？还要什么社会主义呢？雪峰是研究鲁迅的，而鲁迅的最伟大精神，使他能够从进化论走向阶级论的，正是因为他对人民、对历史、对人类有绝对的信心，而追随鲁迅很久的雪峰，却说出“人类没有希望”的话，这怎能和共产党员的名称连在一起呢！这不但否定了共产主义的精神，也否定了鲁迅的精神！
    这是个人主义发展到极端的一种无政府主义的思想，把现实看得没有希望，要否定一切，脱离一切。其他一些反党的人都有这种思想，但雪峰作为一个理论家，这种思想的危险性是更加深刻的。
    问题不是在他们的几个人，而是他们这种思想，也侵蚀了许多新一代的青年的灵魂。许多青年不是在丁玲、冯雪峰和陈企霞等人的影响下走向岔道上去了吗？问题的严重性是在这里。这是关系整个思想界的问题，是一场思想上的大斗争，不解决这些问题，不会有什么文艺的繁荣，不会有什么社会主义的文艺的胜利。因此这个斗争，必须坚决彻底，必须长期的继续深入下去。在这种斗争中，任何温情主义是要不得的。每个文艺工作者，都应该从这次斗争取得深刻的教育，彻底的改造自己。丁玲、冯雪峰、陈企霞等同志更应当痛改前非，洗心革面，重新做人。
