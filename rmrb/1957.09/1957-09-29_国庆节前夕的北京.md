Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The atmosphere of the festival has permeated the entire city of Beijing. In front of the newly renovated Tiananmen Square, workers have begun to erect slogan towers and put up the four large characters "Celebrate National Day" on the square. The electric lights around the square and on the tall buildings have already been installed.

People are busy preparing to receive the review of Chairman Mao and the central leading comrades. Members of the paper flower and silk flower production cooperatives rushed to produce 180,000 paper flowers for the marchers. Members of the firework production cooperative are making various fireworks. The fresh flowers produced by agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs have also been launched on the market in large quantities.

At the Beijing suburban airport and Qianmen Railway Station, people have been welcoming distinguished guests from various countries who have come to our country to attend the celebrations with flowers and cheers for days.

State-owned factories and mines, which are undergoing rectification in full swing, frequently report production successes. On the walls of many factories, red and green slogans are posted, such as "Complete the production plan ahead of schedule and welcome National Day." Today, seventeen state-owned factories and mines have completed or exceeded their September production plans ahead of schedule.

Suburban farmers, who have universally launched a socialist education movement, are welcoming National Day amidst a joyful atmosphere of harvest. Every household's door, roof, courtyard, and vegetable garden are piled high with corn and Chinese cabbage.

A joyful pre-holiday atmosphere permeates the universities. In the courtyard of the Renmin University of China, students are practicing dancing. Teachers and students of Peking University are preparing to help farmers rush to harvest autumn crops on the 30th, and then happily participate in the National Day parade.

Commercial sector workers are busy day and night preparing meat, aquatic products, various vegetables, and fruits for the festival. This year's supply of pork, beef, and mutton for the festival will be more than three times higher than usual.

Staff members of the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio have been working around the clock for days to prepare for the production of the first wide-screen color documentary about the grand celebration of the eighth anniversary of National Day by the people of the capital.
