Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, September 19th: A grand meeting for the Soviet Supreme Soviet Presidium's awarding of the Order of Honor to Nie Yinchu was held last night at the People's Theater in Urumqi.

　　Nie Yinchu is a geological worker and Communist Party member from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region's Geological Bureau. On August 25th of last year, in order to escort Soviet female geological engineer Stepanova, who was seriously ill, by plane to Urumqi for treatment, he risked his life on the way to the airport by climbing onto a steel cable and, with great difficulty, crossed the turbulent Ertix River, delivering the patient to her destination. The patient has fully recovered after treatment.

　　At the awarding ceremony, the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on awarding Nie Yinchu the "Order of Honor" was read out. The Soviet Consul General in Urumqi, Kazansky, pinned the Order of Honor on Nie Yinchu's chest. Kazansky expressed his gratitude to Nie Yinchu on behalf of all Soviet experts in Xinjiang.

　　In his speech, Nie Yinchu thanked the Soviet government and the Soviet people for the honor bestowed upon him.

　　More than a thousand representatives from the Party, government, military, and various sectors of the Autonomous Region and Urumqi City attended the meeting. Soviet experts in Urumqi also attended the meeting.
