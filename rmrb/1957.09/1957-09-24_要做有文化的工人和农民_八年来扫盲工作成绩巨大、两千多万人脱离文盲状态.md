    To Be Cultured Workers and Peasants
    Great Achievements in Literacy Work Over the Past Eight Years; More Than 20 Million People Escape Illiteracy
    (Xinhua News Agency) It is reported by Xinhua News Agency that 22 million people across the country have escaped illiteracy, and 1.6 million people have reached the cultural level of graduating from senior primary school and junior middle school. The Ministry of Education recently summarized the literacy work of the past eight years and provided the above figures.
    According to statistics from the last academic year, the number of students participating in spare-time education for workers and peasants across the country is approximately 79 million, equivalent to six times that of 1949. Among them, more than five million are studying in spare-time senior primary school classes, and more than one million are studying in middle school classes.
    After the vast numbers of workers and peasants learned culture, great changes took place in their lives and production. Wu Shaocheng from the Chengdu Red Flag Iron Factory, who was originally illiterate, absorbed advanced experience from newspapers after learning culture and improved the operation method of the double-share stubble plate. Production efficiency increased from 600 pieces per day to 1,300 pieces, breaking the highest national record at the time.
    Farmers who graduated from literacy classes have played a significant role in developing production and enlivening rural cultural life. For example, in Fujia Yuan Village, Chou Sang Township, Yao County, Shaanxi Province, there was not even one primary school student, and all the young and middle-aged people were illiterate. Now, the village subscribes to six or seven newspapers and periodicals, such as "Farmer's Daily," "China Youth Daily," and "Rural Propagandist." Everyone rushes to read the newspapers when they arrive. The work in the village is also done better than before, and all work is at the forefront.
    It was difficult to imagine workers entering university in the old society, but today it is not uncommon. Last year, more than 40 of the 130 graduates from the Tianjin Workers' Spare-time High School were admitted to Tianjin University or Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology. The Beijing Institute of Mining has hundreds of students who come from miners.
    Currently, a network of spare-time education for workers and peasants has been formed from the central to the local levels. In addition to more than 70,000 full-time teachers across the country, there are also more than 7 million mass teachers. This year, the state will mobilize more manpower to participate in this work to further strengthen the literacy campaign.

    要做有文化的工人和农民
    八年来扫盲工作成绩巨大、两千多万人脱离文盲状态
    据新华社讯  全国已有二千二百万人脱离文盲状态，并已有一百六十万人达到高小和初中毕业文化程度。教育部最近总结八年来的扫盲工作，提供了上述的数字。
    根据上一学年的统计，全国参加工农业余学习的在学人数约七千九百多万人，相当于1949年的六倍，其中五百多万人在业余高小班学习，一百多万人在中学班学习。
    广大的工人和农民学习文化后，生活和生产方面都起了很大的变化。成都市红旗铁工厂吴绍成，原来是个文盲，学习文化后，从报上吸收先进经验，改进了双铧挡草板的操作方法，生产效率从每日生产六百件提高到一千三百件，打破了当时全国最高的纪录。
    从扫盲班毕业的农民对发展生产、活跃农村文化生活起了很大作用。如陕西省耀县稠桑乡傅家源村，原来连一个小学生都没有，青壮年全部是文盲，如今村里订有农民报、青年报、农村宣传员等六、七种报刊。报一送来大家抢着看。村里的工作也比从前作得好了，啥工作都走在头里。
    工人入大学在旧社会是很难想像的，今天已经不是什么稀奇的事情了。去年从天津职工业余高中毕业的一百三十多名学员中，有四十多人已经考入了天津大学或北京钢铁学院。北京矿业学院有几百名学生是从矿工中来的。
    目前从中央到地方的工农业余教育网已经形成，全国除有七万多名专职教师外，还有七百多万名群众教师。今年，国家还要动员更多的人力来参加这项工作，使扫盲队伍更加壮大。
