	British Trades Union Congress

	The British Trades Union Congress was founded in 1868. This trade union organization is merely a consultative body, and the resolutions passed at its annual meeting do not have much binding force on lower-level unions. The highest leading body of the Trades Union Congress is the General Council, whose members are elected by the annual meeting. It has always been controlled by right-wing trade union leaders in Britain.

	The British Trades Union Congress has more than 180 member unions, with a total membership of 8.25 million. These include the vast majority of large and medium-sized unions in Britain, as well as many small unions. The seventeen largest unions alone account for about 75% of the total membership of the Trades Union Congress.

	In recent years, each annual meeting of the British Trades Union Congress has discussed the situation of the British labor movement and major international issues of the time. Because the Trades Union Congress is the main social base of the British Labour Party, its annual meeting is always held before the Labour Party's annual meeting in order to propose guidelines on many important issues as the basis for the Labour Party's discussions, and thus influence the Labour Party's policies. Delegates to the annual meeting are elected by each member organization according to the principle of one delegate for every 5,000 members. Due to the control of the Trades Union Congress by the right-wing leadership group, and some undemocratic restrictions at the meeting, the results of the annual meeting often cannot accurately and comprehensively reflect the wishes of the broad masses of British workers.

	Nevertheless, due to the intensification of the working class's struggle to win its own rights and the growth of progressive forces in the Trades Union Congress, the discussions and resolutions of the post-war annual meetings have to a considerable extent reflected the opinions and demands of the workers. For example, at the 88th annual meeting held last year, all the delegates for the first time unanimously passed a resolution opposing the government's wage freeze policy, an action that caused a stir in Britain.

	The 89th annual meeting will be held in Blackpool from September 2nd to 6th this year. Among the proposals submitted to this annual meeting, two issues are very prominent: (1) disarmament, especially the issue of stopping nuclear weapons testing; (2) the issue of demanding the implementation of a wage policy that can keep up with rising living costs.

### 英国职工大会

    英国职工大会
    英国职工大会成立于1868年，这个工会组织仅仅是一个协商机构，它的年会通过的决议对下级工会没有多大约束力。职工大会的最高领导机关是最高委员会，成员由年会选举产生，它一直被英国的右翼工会领袖所控制。
    英国职工大会拥有一百八十多个会员工会，目前会员总人数达到了八百二十五万。其中包括了英国绝大多数的大型及中型工会以及许多小工会，仅十七个大工会就占了职工大会全体会员的75％左右。
    近年来，英国职工大会每届年会都讨论了英国工人运动的情况以及当时国际上的重大问题。由于职工大会是英国工党的主要社会基础，所以它的年会总是在工党年会之前举行，以便在许多重要问题上提出方针，作为工党讨论的基础，因而也就对工党的政策产生了影响。年会的代表是由各会员团体按每五千名会员选一人的原则选举产生的。由于职工大会右翼领导集团的把持，以及会议上的一些不民主的限制，年会的结果时常不能正确地全面地反映英国广大工人群众的愿望。
    尽管如此，由于工人阶级争取本身权利斗争的加强和职工大会中进步力量的增长，战后历届年会的讨论和决议还是在相当程度上反映了工人的意见和要求。例如：在去年举行的第八十八届年会上，全体代表就破天荒地一致通过了反对政府的冻结工资政策的决议，这一行动曾在英国震动一时。
    从今年9月2日到6日在布莱克浦举行的是第八十九届年会。在向这届年会提出的提案中有两个问题是非常突出的，那就是：（一）裁军，特别是停止核武器试验问题；（二）要求实施能追得上日益上涨的生活费用的工资政策问题。
