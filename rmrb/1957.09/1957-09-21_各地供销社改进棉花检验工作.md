    To educate cotton farmers to establish the ideology of building the country and managing households through diligence and frugality, producing and selling more, retaining less for economical use, sun-drying and picking clean, and selling good cotton to the state, supply and marketing cooperatives in cotton-producing areas across the country have adopted a series of measures to strengthen and improve cotton inspection work, and vigorously implement the "superior quality, superior price" policy.

    Before the new cotton was上市 (on the market), various places held technical training courses. Shandong, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Shanxi, Henan, and Hebei provinces alone trained more than 100,000 graders for agricultural cooperatives. After the new cotton began to bloom, various places dispatched a large number of cadres to go deep into the agricultural cooperatives to carry out propaganda, education, and technical guidance work.

    In order to better implement the "high quality, high price" policy, this year, various places have generally implemented methods such as grading against standards, manually measuring length with rulers, deducting or compensating for water and impurities, and test-ginning the lint percentage. At the same time, the country has also ordered more than 2,000 sets of various large-scale inspection instruments such as impurity analyzers, electrical measuring instruments, and drying ovens.

    Many regions this year have learned from the lessons of last year, where the inspection of intermediate links was neglected, making it impossible to discover work deviations in a timely manner. It has been decided that all cotton purchased from farmers must undergo a technical assessment before entering the factory for processing, so as to discover and correct deviations in a timely manner.

    However, in some areas, inspection personnel only rely on old experience to handle affairs, subjectively believing that the grade of early-stage cotton will not be too high, resulting in grades being assessed too strictly, and even cases of downgrading and price suppression. The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives has reminded various localities to pay attention to preventing and correcting this. (Zhang Xing)

    各地供销社改进棉花检验工作
    本报讯　为了教育棉农树立勤俭建国和勤俭持家的思想，多产多卖，少留节用，晒干拣净，多卖好棉给国家，全国各产棉区的供销合作社采取了一系列的加强和改进棉花检验工作的措施，大力贯彻“优级优价”政策。
    在新棉上市以前，各地举办了技术传授训练班，仅山东、陕西、江苏、山西、河南、河北六个省就为农业社训练了分级员十万多人。新棉吐絮后，各地又抽派大批干部深入农业社进行宣传教育和技术指导工作。
    为了更好地贯彻“优质优价”政策，今年各地普遍实行了对照标准定级、手扯尺量长度、水杂扣补、试轧衣分等办法，同时全国还订购了杂质分析机、电测器、烘箱等各种大型检验仪器两千多台。
    许多地区今年在收购工作中接受了去年因忽视中间环节的检查，不能及时发现工作偏差的教训，决定凡是收购农民的棉花在入厂加工以前都要通过一道技术考核，做到及时发现和纠正偏差。
    但是，有些地区的检验人员只凭过去的老经验办事，主观地认为初期花等级不会太高，因而出现等级掌握偏紧，甚至压级压价的情况。全国供销合作总社已提醒各地注意防止和纠正。（张兴）
