Since the socialist education, a tremendous change is taking place in the broad rural areas of Hubei. In the words of the masses, "the idea of loving the country, loving the collective, and loving the family has been further established."

**Grain Procurement Task Completed Ahead of Schedule**

Not long ago, the phenomenon of rich middle peasants leading the complaints about grain shortage and insufficient supply was common. Now, after a two-road debate centered on grain, this phenomenon has disappeared. Everywhere, people talk about grain with two sayings: "Grain in the hands of the state is the treasure of treasures (i.e., guaranteeing supply); in private hands, it is the harm of harms (i.e., speculation and profiteering)." Many places have set off a wave of early delivery of public grain and more sales of surplus grain. Jiangling County, which had a bumper harvest, plans to sell more than 80 million jin of increased grain in addition to overfulfilling the unified purchase task this year. 180 cooperatives in the county also voluntarily offered to sell 2.35 million jin of old grain. In some places, the view of autumn grain collection has always been: "Autumn grain collection, autumn grain collection, only starts after the autumn harvest." However, this year broke the historical habit, and the public grain task was overfulfilled before the collection even started. For example, Pengxing District of Xiaogan County had an annual public grain task of 8.4 million jin, and after the bumper harvest of mid-season rice, the task was completed at 8.51 million jin. In many places, after debates on the phenomenon of concealing grain production, people became clear-headed and realized that this was "forgetting the foundation of socialism." They all consciously reported the actual output and sold surplus grain. The rich middle peasants in cooperatives in various places began to overcome capitalist ideas.

**Rich Middle Peasants Gradually Increase Awareness**

Xia Jiru, a rich middle peasant in Xiaji Township, Nanzhang County, had long been uneasy about production and envied the freedom of individual farming. After this big debate, his awareness and enthusiasm for production have improved. He posted a couplet on his door saying: "The old road of relying on exploitation to eat is very shameful; the new road of relying on production to get rich is the most glorious," with the horizontal inscription: "Don't think wildly." In Yongjiu Cooperative, Baiyun Township, Sui County, seven rich middle peasant households once wanted to take back the livestock they had contributed to the cooperative at a discounted price to do business. Under their influence, twelve middle peasant households newly bought livestock, and ten households were preparing to buy livestock. In this debate, more than 400 cooperative members used their personal experience of the benefits of the cooperative to refute these people taking the capitalist road. Now the phenomenon of driving livestock for business is gone, and those who are preparing to buy livestock have saved their money and obeyed the cooperative's allocation for production.

**Many Individual Farmers Request to Join Cooperatives**

The phenomenon of individual farmers voluntarily applying to join cooperatives is very common in various places. In Jianggou District and Shiqiao District of Xiangyang County, 98 out of more than 100 individual farmer households applied to join the cooperative. In Yuanzhuang Township, Zaoyang County, 24 out of the original 27 individual farmer households have now applied to join the cooperative. Some individual farmers, in order to express their determination to join the cooperative, posted couplets saying: "In the past, I wanted to farm individually, compare and see, who can increase production? Now I want to join the cooperative, calculate the accounts, it's still worthwhile," with the horizontal inscription: "Resolutely voluntary." Some grassroots cadres whose work was passive and who were planning to retreat, after debates at the three-level cadre meeting, no longer retreated. More than 30 cadres in Hezhan Township, Wuchang County, and 23 members of the Communist Youth League in Xiaodian Township, Sui County, examined their thoughts of retreat and said: "If we don't do it, who will? Let the landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements do it? That can only lead to going backwards - fleeing famine."

**Sabotage Activities of Landlords and Rich Peasants are Attacked**

The sabotage activities of landlords and rich peasants in various places have been universally exposed and criticized by the masses. In Hongxing Cooperative, Daqiao Township, Wuchang County, a landlord saw that the mother of poor peasant cooperative member Chen Jinlin was somewhat dissatisfied with the cooperative's distribution, and often went to provoke discord, saying that the cooperative would not last long. This day, Chen Jinlin's mother came back from the debate meeting, and the landlord went to talk nonsense again. She angrily said: "The Communist Party is my backstage boss, the Kuomintang is your backstage boss. My boss can't collapse, and the cooperative won't collapse." She shouted the landlord out. In some places, with the improvement of cadres' awareness, they began to make comprehensive arrangements for households in difficulty. Among the more than 1,000 cooperatives in Zigui, Xingshan, Changyang, and Dangyang counties, 752 cooperatives have already made comprehensive arrangements for households in difficulty in terms of production and life, and 44 cooperatives are in the process of making arrangements. After the arrangements, households in difficulty can guarantee an increase in income throughout the year, which has played a great role in improving the enthusiasm of cooperative members for production and consolidating the cooperative.

### 爱国爱社爱家的思想进一步树立起来  湖北农村出现新气象

    爱国爱社爱家的思想进一步树立起来
    湖北农村出现新气象
    本报武汉28日电　经过社会主义教育以后，湖北广大农村正在经历着一个巨大的变化，用群众的话来说就是：“爱国爱社爱家的思想进一步树立起来了”。
    粮食征购任务提前完成
    不久以前，以富裕中农为首的吵粮食紧张、供应不足的现象比比皆是，现在以粮食为中心开展两条道路辩论以后，这个现象没有了；这里那里，人们谈起粮食问题有两句话：“粮食掌握在国家手里，宝中之宝（即保证供应）；掌握在私人手里，害中之害（即投机倒把）”许多地方掀起了早交公粮多售余粮的热潮。丰收的江陵县，今年计划除超额完成统购任务外，再卖出增产粮八千多万斤。这个县还有一百八十个合作社自愿报卖陈粮二百三十五万斤。有些地方一向对秋征的看法是：“秋征，秋征，秋收以后才开征”可是今年打破了历史习惯，不到开征，就超额完成了公粮任务。例如孝感县朋兴区全年公粮任务八百四十万斤，中稻丰收后，已完成任务达八百五十一万斤。不少地方对于隐瞒粮食产量的现象展开辩论以后，人们的头脑清醒了，认识这是“忘了社会主义的大本”，都自觉的报实产量，出售余粮。各地合作社的富裕中农开始克服了资本主义思想。
    富裕中农逐步提高觉悟
    南漳县夏继乡富裕中农夏继如长期不安心生产，羡慕单干自由。这次大辩论后，他的觉悟和生产积极性都提高了，在门上贴出对联说：“旧道路靠剥削吃饭很耻辱；新道路靠生产致富最光荣”，横联是：“不乱想”。随县白云乡永久社有七户富裕中农曾经把折价入社的牲口要回去做生意，在他们的影响下，有十二户中农新买了牲口，有十户准备买牲口。这次的辩论中有四百多个社员以自己在合作社切身体会的好处，驳倒了这些走资本主义道路的人。现在赶牲口做生意的现象没有了，准备买牲口的人把钱存起来，服从社的调配进行生产。
    许多单干农民要求入社
    各地单干农民自愿申请入社的现象很普遍。襄阳县姜沟区和石桥区的一百多户单干农民里，申请入社的就有九十八户，枣阳县袁庄乡原有二十七户单干农民，现在申请入社的有二十四户。有些单干农民为了表示入社的决心，贴出对联说：“过去想单干，比比看，谁能增产，现在想入社，算算账，还是合算”，横联是：“坚决自愿”。有些工作消极打算退坡的基层干部经过三级干部会议的辩论，不退坡了。武昌县贺占乡三十多个干部，随县肖店乡二十三个共青团员检查退坡的思想时说：“我们不干叫谁干，让地主富农坏分子来干吗？那只有走回头路——逃荒。”
    地主富农破坏活动受到打击
    各地的地主富农的破坏活动普遍受到群众的揭露批判。武昌县大桥乡红星社一个地主看见贫农社员陈金林的母亲对社的分配等有些不满意，经常去挑拨离间，说合作社办不长久了。这天陈金林的母亲从辩论会上回来，这个地主又去胡说八道，她气愤地说：“共产党是我的后台老板，国民党是你的后台老板，我这个老板垮不了台，合作社就垮不了台。”她把这个地主喊出去了。有些地方随着干部觉悟的提高，开始对困难户作全面安排。秭归、兴山、长阳、当阳四个县的一千多个社中，已经对困难户在生产和生活方面作全面安排的有七百五十二个社，正在安排的四十四个社。经过安排，困难户可以保证全年增加收入，这对于提高社员生产积极性和巩固合作社起了很大作用。
