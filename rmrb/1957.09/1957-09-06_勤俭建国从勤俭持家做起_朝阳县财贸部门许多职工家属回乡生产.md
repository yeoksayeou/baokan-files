Build the Country Through Thrift and Hard Work, Starting with Thrifty Housekeeping
Many Family Members of Staff and Workers in Chaoyang County's Finance and Trade Departments Return to the Countryside to Engage in Production

    (Our Dispatch) A number of family members of staff and workers in the finance and trade departments in Chaoyang County, Liaoning Province, who are able to return to the countryside have recently been mobilized to return to their villages to participate in production.
    Among the 1,292 staff and workers in the 19 units of the finance and trade departments in Chaoyang County, 867 households have family members, of which 532 households moved in from the countryside. The vast majority of these family members are rural laborers. After entering the city, they became separated from production, which has affected agricultural production. At the same time, due to the higher standard of living in the city, the economic burden on staff and workers has increased after their family members entered the city, and some people's work morale has been affected. On the other hand, due to the continuous increase in family members entering the city, many dormitories have been built in recent years, but they still cannot meet the needs, which has increased the state's financial expenditure. As for the staff and workers who often ask for public subsidies due to financial difficulties, this has also increased the state's burden. The increase in the urban population has also brought great difficulties to the relevant departments in terms of material supply, especially the supply of non-staple foods.
    In order to solve these problems, the finance and trade departments in Chaoyang County have carried out a series of work to mobilize family members of staff and workers to return to their villages to participate in production. Currently, 109 households have been identified to return to the countryside, and some have already returned.
    In the course of mobilization, comprehensive investigation and research were first carried out. For example, whether these family members have the ability to work, whether there is a home in the countryside, and whether family relations are normal (such as the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, sisters-in-law, etc.), were all clarified in advance, and then persuasion and mobilization were carried out separately. For those who need to establish separate households after returning, have no one to take care of their children, cannot participate in agricultural production, or whose hometown is far away, making it inconvenient for staff and workers to return home to visit relatives, or one of the spouses is ill and needs close care, and family members have temporary jobs in the city, except for those who voluntarily return, they are generally not mobilized for the time being.
    Secondly, meticulous and specific political and ideological education work is carried out to address some of the ideological concerns that exist among staff, workers, and their families. In this regard, there are several main experiences: First, family members generally act according to their husband's attitude, so the key is to get through the staff and workers' thinking. Second, leading cadres and Party and Communist Youth League members set an example. For example, after the mobilization work began, Zhang Guodong, deputy manager of the Coal Construction Company, first mobilized his wife to return, which had a good impact on other staff and workers. Third, it is necessary to raise the ideological understanding of family members and explain the importance of returning to the countryside to participate in agricultural production.
    In addition, while strengthening ideological work, some specific issues also need to be addressed. For example, after family members return, staff and workers should be allowed to return home for reunions during holidays. If family members have financial difficulties such as lack of travel expenses after returning to the countryside, the trade union and administration should also help solve them.

    勤俭建国从勤俭持家做起
    朝阳县财贸部门许多职工家属回乡生产
    本报讯　辽宁省朝阳县县城财经贸易部门，最近动员了一批能够回农村的职工家属回乡参加生产。
    朝阳县城财贸部门共十九个单位的一千二百九十二名职工当中，带家属的有八百六十七户，其中由农村迁入的占五百三十二户。这些家属绝大部分是农村的劳动力，进城后脱离生产，使农业生产受到影响。同时，由于城市生活水平较高，家属进城之后，职工的经济负担加重，有的人工作情绪受到影响。另一方面，由于进城家属不断增加，几年来修建不少宿舍，仍不能满足需要，这就使国家增加了财政开支。至于职工因为生活困难，时常要求公家补助，也使国家增加了一笔负担。城市人口增多，在物资供应，特别是副食品供应方面，更给有关部门带来很大的困难。
    为了解决这些问题，朝阳县城财贸部门进行了一系列的工作，动员职工家属回乡参加生产。现已确定回农村的有一百零九户，一部分已经回去。
    他们在动员工作当中，首先作好了全面的调查研究。例如这些家属有无劳动能力，农村是否有家、家庭关系是否正常（如婆媳关系、妯娌关系等），都事先弄清情况，然后分别进行说服动员。对于回去需要单独立户，小孩无人照顾、不能参加农业生产，或是家乡距离很远，职工回家探亲不便，或男女的一方有病需要就近照顾和家属在城市有临时工作的，除自愿回去以外，一般暂不动员。
    其次，针对职工和家属所存在的一些思想顾虑，进行细致、具体的政治思想教育工作。在这方面，有这样几个主要经验：一、家属一般都根据丈夫的态度行事，因此关键在于打通职工的思想。二、领导干部和党、团员以身作则。如煤建公司副经理张国栋在动员工作开始以后，先把自己爱人动员回去，对其他职工有很好的影响。三、必须提高家属的思想认识，说明回乡参加农业生产的重要意义。
    此外，在加强思想工作的同时，有一些具体问题也需要加以解决。如：家属回去以后，应利用假期让职工能回家团聚。家属回农村，如有缺乏路费等经济上的困难，工会和行政也应帮助解决。
