On the Anti-Rightist Front

    Anshan Iron and Steel Company Engineering and Technical Personnel Expose Wang Ziyou's Anti-Communist Words and Deeds
    Engineering and technical personnel of Anshan Iron and Steel Company exposed the anti-Communist words and deeds of the rightist Wang Ziyou.
    Wang Ziyou was the Deputy Director of the Technical Supervision Department of the Chief Engineer of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. He spread the fallacy everywhere that the Party could not lead science and technology, and slandered the managers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company as "white hats" and demanded their dismissal. He and another rightist, Shen Naimin, sang in chorus, saying, "The Kuomintang is a small faction, and the Communist Party is a big faction." He also slandered Premier Zhou's report on the issue of intellectuals: "It's just like giving an injection of morphine."
    Wang Ziyou's anti-Communist words and deeds have historical roots. He joined the Kuomintang in 1926 and served as an executive committee member of a district in Tianjin City for the Kuomintang in 1927. In 1936, he went to the United States to study, and after returning to China, he became a prominent figure in the Kuomintang. He shamelessly proclaimed to others: "Chairman Chiang Kai-shek invited me to dinner."
    Helping Rightist Students Plot Trouble, Ben Xiaoyu Became a Traitor to the Party
    Nanchang Normal College in Jiangxi Province exposed the reactionary words and deeds of Ben Xiaoyu, the Director of the President's Office and a rightist within the Party.
    When the rectification campaign began, Ben Xiaoyu and rightists outside the Party launched a major offensive against the Party. He said: "This time the airing of views will be concluded by Zhang Bojun, because he is the leader of the democratic parties." He feared that the world would not be in chaos and helped rightist students plot trouble. When some students asked him whether they could establish a school-wide airing of views committee, he said: "Although other schools have not established it, we can also establish it. If we can solve the problem quickly, it will also be a creation of experience." Later, in the name of a member of the school affairs committee, he put forward this opinion at the school affairs committee meeting. He also praised Chu Anping's boldness among more than 30 students and encouraged students to make suggestions to the Provincial Party Committee. When the rightist Liao Guozhen clamored to post big-character posters to the Provincial Party Committee and the Education Department, Ben Xiaoyu said: "Some problems need to be resolved by the higher authorities."
    After the anti-rightist struggle began, Ben Xiaoyu tried his best to plan a way out for the rightists and help them get through the ordeal. With the collapse of the rightist clique, Ben Xiaoyu's true colors were finally exposed.

    在反右派战线上
    鞍钢公司工程技术人员揭露王子佑的反共言行
    鞍钢公司工程技术人员，揭露了右派分子王子佑的反共言行。
    王子佑是鞍钢总工程师技术监督处副处长，他到处宣扬党不能领导科学技术的谬论，并诬蔑鞍钢公司的经理是“白帽子”，要他们下台。他和另一右派分子沈乃敏一唱一和地说：“国民党是小宗派，共产党是大宗派。”他还诬蔑周总理关于知识分子问题的报告：“只不过是打了一针吗啡针。”
    王子佑的反共言行是有历史根源的。他1926年就加入了国民党，1927年曾任国民党天津市一个区的执行委员。1936年他到美国留学，回国后，即成为国民党的显要人物。他还恬不知耻地向别人宣扬：“蒋委员长请我吃过饭。”
    帮助右派学生策划闹事贲效育成了党的叛徒
    江西省南昌师专揭露校长办公室主任、党内右派分子贲效育的反动言行。
    整风开始，贲效育就和党外右派分子一道向党大举进攻。他说：“这次鸣放将来会由章伯钧作结论，因为他是民主党派的头子。”他唯恐天下不乱，帮助右派学生策划闹事。有的学生问他是否可以成立全校鸣放委员会时，他说：“别校虽未成立，我们也可以成立，假如能很快解决问题，倒也是创造经验。”以后并以校务委员的名义在校务委员会上提出了这个意见。他还在三十多名学生中赞扬储安平大胆，鼓动学生向省委提意见。右派分子廖国桢叫嚣要把大字报贴到省委和教育厅去，贲效育就说：“有些问题是需要上面解决的。”
    反右派斗争开始后，贲效育极力给右派分子策划后路，帮助他们过关。随着右派集团的土崩瓦解，贲效育的原形终于暴露出来了。
