Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, September 2nd. Li Yuying, Director of the Democratic Women's Federation of Qidong County, Hunan Province, and a Communist Party member, who has been named a model worker four times in seven years, has recently promoted grain conservation among members of the Sanguan Agricultural Cooperative, achieving new successes. The Sanguan Cooperative's experience in grain conservation has not only been notified to all townships for study by the Qidong County Party Committee, but was also presented at the Hunan Provincial Special and County Women Cadres Conference, which closed on August 31.

Li Yuying departed yesterday for Beijing to attend the upcoming National Women's Congress.

In mid-August, Li Yuying went to the Sanguan Cooperative in Buyunqiao Township to understand the grain conservation situation. At that time, the new grain had just been harvested, and some cadres believed that there was no waste because the masses were not distilling alcohol or boiling sugar. However, during her investigation, she discovered that farmers generally had the idea of eating a little more after the autumn harvest. More than thirty households were consuming about two jin of grain per person per day, which would mean that the year's retained grain would only be enough to eat for eight or nine months. More than half of the households in the cooperative were also using large quantities of staple food to feed pigs, chickens, and ducks.

Based on her understanding, Li Yuying first educated the cadres of the Sanguan Cooperative, reversing their complacency. At the cooperative cadres' meeting, everyone expressed their intention to take the lead in conservation and educate the members to overcome wasteful practices. Next, Li Yuying convened a women cadres' meeting to discuss how to conserve grain. The methods proposed were: to eat mixed grains with staple foods in a planned way; to mix cold rice to increase the rice yield; to use miscellaneous grains, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, amaranth, alfalfa, etc. to feed pigs; and to avoid boiling sugar and distilling alcohol, etc. Through the joint efforts of Li Yuying and the cooperative cadres, 50% of the households in the cooperative have now drawn up their grain consumption plans for the coming year, and some households are still in the process of formulating them.

    湖南祁东县妇女模范李玉英
    积极推动农业社节约粮食
    新华社长沙2日电 七年中四次被评为工作模范的湖南省祁东县民主妇女联合会主任、共产党员李玉英，最近又推动三官农业合作社社员节约用粮，作出新的成绩。三官社节约用粮的经验，不仅由中共祁东县委通知各乡注意学习，在8月31日闭幕的湖南省专、县妇女干部会上也作了介绍。
    李玉英已在昨天动身去北京参加即将召开的全国妇女代表大会。
    8月中旬，李玉英到步云桥乡三官社了解节约用粮情况，这时新粮收割不久，部分干部认为群众不蒸酒、熬糖，没有浪费现象。但是她在调查中却发现农民在秋收后普遍有多吃一点的思想，有三十几户社员每人每天吃粮达到两斤左右，这样下去全年留粮只够吃八、九个月。全社还有一半以上的农户大量用主粮喂猪，喂鸡鸭。
    李玉英根据她了解的情况，首先向三官社的干部进行教育，扭转了他们的麻痹思想。在社干部会上，大家都表示要带头节约，并教育社员克服浪费现象。接着，李玉英又召开一次妇女干部会讨论如何节约用粮，大家提出的办法是：有计划地用杂粮搭配主粮食用；掺冷饭提高出饭率；用杂粮、甜菜、南瓜、苋菜、苜蓿等喂猪；不熬糖、煮酒等等。经过李玉英和社干部共同努力，现在全社已有50％的农户订出了今后一年的用粮计划，有的户现在仍在制定中。（附图片）
