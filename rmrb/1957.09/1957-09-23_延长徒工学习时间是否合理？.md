	Is it Reasonable to Extend the Apprenticeship Period?

	The Beijing Electronic Tube Factory is a factory that started operations last year. New workers account for about 80% of the factory's employees. According to the regulations of the State Council, a considerable number of apprentices will not be promoted and upgraded this year. Therefore, in this great blooming and contending, the issue of apprentice promotion and upgrading has become the center of debate. Published here are excerpts from big character posters related to this issue.

	Apprentice Promotion is Too Fast

	Currently, apprentice promotion is too fast. I interviewed several veteran masters who said that in the past, apprenticeships took three or four years to complete, and after completing their apprenticeship, they only received the lowest wages. Many veteran masters have worked for more than ten years and are now only at the fourth or fifth grade. But now our apprentices, the short ones only take five or six months, and the long ones only take about a year to be promoted to the third or fourth grade. I myself returned to the factory after a six-month apprenticeship at an old factory, and I was promoted to the fourth grade during the wage reform (like us, we should not be upgraded again in the near future). Veteran masters have accumulated more than ten years of experience, and we have only done one or two years of work. After production accidents occur, young technicians panic, some even unable to handle them, while veteran masters can handle them very calmly. Furthermore, veteran masters have worked for ten, twenty, or thirty years and have made great contributions to the socialist cause, and should receive more remuneration. But what about us? We were raised by our families from childhood, and then educated by society when we grew up. We have not yet made any contributions to society after apprenticing in the factory, and yet we receive forty or fifty yuan a month, which is equivalent to half a year's living expenses for a farmer. This is very inappropriate. I think there are shortcomings in the apprentice promotion system, it rises too fast. In addition to fostering complacency among young people, it is also detrimental to strengthening the worker-peasant alliance. Therefore, I fully support the State Council's decision to extend the apprenticeship period and reduce apprentice wages.

	Please Expedite the Formulation of Measures by the State Council

	Comrade Liu Xuexi's opinion is correct. It is indeed very unreasonable for us young people to be promoted to third or fourth-grade workers after a few months or a year of internship. Because our young people have short apprenticeship periods and are promoted too quickly, it not only affects the unity of new and old workers, but more importantly, it fosters the faults of pride, complacency, and disrespect for veteran masters, and not striving to delve into technology. Therefore, I hope that the State Council will expedite the formulation of specific measures to extend the apprenticeship period and reduce apprentice wages. At the same time, for junior and primary school graduates who joined enterprises last year and the year before, if they have already been promoted to the third or fourth grade, a regulation should be made that they will not be upgraded again within two or three years.

	Are Apprentice Wages Unreasonable?

	I also worked as an apprentice in the old society for two years, as a student in a pharmacy. When eating, my eyes had to watch the shop owner and his wife eat. When there was only a mouthful of rice left in their bowls, I had to quickly add rice with both hands. A slight delay would result in glares. In order to learn a few English drug names, I had to take out one and a half dou of rice (about four yuan now) from my monthly salary of two dou of rice and give it to the shop owner. There were no Sundays, and I worked at least seventeen hours a day. Dozing off would result in scolding. This painful life is still difficult to recall.

	Today's apprentices work eight hours a day, learn technology as soon as they enter the factory, and receive a salary of 25 yuan a month. Is the treatment still low? I hope you will listen to the talks of people who have been apprentices in the old society, and then you will feel that you are now in paradise.
					Kong Zhihe

	Think About It, Apprentices

	Under the cultivation and care of the people, you walked from schools into factories, veteran masters patiently teach you technology, and the state gives you high remuneration. You should thank the education of the Party and the people. However, today you have not created wealth for the country, but are arguing about wages.

	In the past when we were apprentices, we got up before the sun came out every day, and couldn't sleep until after nine o'clock in the evening. There were no Sundays, and sometimes we were beaten and scolded. After suffering like this for three years, the wages we earned were only equal to your current monthly wage.

	Now you are in modern factories, doing very light physical labor, learning advanced technology, eating rice and white flour, and living in high-rise buildings, which is a hundred or a thousand times better than in the past. I think it's truly paradise.
				Old worker Zhao Yuzhen

	The Apprenticeship Promotion Time Should Not Be Extended

	Many veteran masters believe that the current apprentice promotion is too fast and wages are too high. I think these opinions are currying favor. I worked as an apprentice in the old society for more than three years. During these three years, my job was to hold children, cook, carry water, sweep the floor, and empty chamber pots. I was not learning technology, but working as a servant. In 1954, I entered a technical school and dealt with machines all day long. In a year and a half, I mastered the fourth-grade worker technology. Shouldn't we have a corresponding level if we have corresponding technology? Extending the promotion of apprentices with considerable technology, isn't this an act of exploitation in capitalist society? I think extending the apprenticeship promotion time is unreasonable.
				"Tape Recorder"

	Today's Apprentices Are Different from the Past

	Some veteran masters compare today's apprentices with apprentices in the past, which is inappropriate. Apprentices in the old society did not understand culture, and veteran masters were conservative and unwilling to teach. Apprentices only did odd jobs. Now apprentices have a certain level of culture, veteran masters are not conservative, and apprentices can concentrate on learning technology, so technology improves quickly. The promotion of apprentices is not all fast now, it cannot be generalized. Remuneration according to labor is the superiority of socialism. If apprentices reach the technical level of a technician, they should be promoted. One cannot involve the whole because of a part, which can easily cause contradictions between veteran masters and apprentices.
					"A Group"

	Uphold Socialist Interests

	We firmly support Liu Xuexi's opinion and the opinions of the veteran workers. The opinions of "Tape Recorder" and "A Group" are wrong. You think the opinions of the veteran workers are "currying favor." Even if it is "currying favor," they are currying favor with the socialist wind and patting the socialist horse. They are upholding socialist interests. What's wrong with that? The technology of veteran masters is hard-won, and we should learn from them very well. We cannot look down on them just because we have some culture. Promoting too fast will foster pride and complacency. Some junior high school graduates in our factory, after studying for a year, were rated as third or fourth-grade workers when they returned to the factory, but compared with veteran masters, their technology and experience are far behind, and their technology is very narrow. Extending the apprenticeship period is beneficial to both the country and the apprentices themselves. There is no question of capitalist exploitation at all. As the veteran workers said, the culture and technology of young people are cultivated by the country. We should thank the Party and the state, and thank the veteran masters.

### 延长徒工学习时间是否合理？

专栏：企业里的大字报

    延长徒工学习时间是否合理？
    北京电子管厂是去年开工的厂。新工人约占全厂职工的80％。根据国务院的规定，今年有相当一部分徒工不能转正晋级。因此，在这次大鸣大放中，徒工转正晋级问题就成了争论的中心。这里发表的是有关这个问题的大字报的一部分。
    徒工晋级太快
    目前徒工晋级太快。我访了几个老师傅，知道他们过去学徒要三、四年才出师，出师后只能拿到最低的工资。有很多老师傅工作十几年，现在才四、五级工。但现在我们的学徒工，短的只五、六个月，长的只一年左右就升为三、四级工。我自己就是到老厂学徒六个月回厂后，工资改革时就晋到了四级工（像我们这样在今后相当时期内不应再升级了。）老师傅积累了十几年的经验，我们只不过做了一、二年的工作。发生生产事故以后，青年技工就慌忙，有的甚至无法处理，而老师傅却能很沉着地处理。再说，老师傅工作十几年、二、三十年，对社会主义事业贡献大，应该得到较多的报酬。但我们呢？从小受家庭的抚养，长大了又受到社会的教养，到工厂学徒对社会还没有什么贡献，每月就拿四五十元，顶上一个农民半年生活。这很不妥当。我认为徒工的晋级制度有缺点，升得太快了。这除了助长青年人的自满情绪，对加强工农联盟也不利。因此，我完全拥护国务院关于延长徒工期限，减少徒工工资。
                    青工　刘学熹
    请国务院赶快定出办法
    刘学熹同志的意见是对的。我们青年人实习了几个月或一年，就升为三、四级工人，的确很不合理。由于我们青年人学徒期限短，晋级太快，不仅影响新老工人的团结，更主要的是助长了青年人的骄傲、自满，不尊重老师傅，不努力钻研技术的毛病。因此，我希望国务院赶快制定延长徒工期限，减少徒工工资的具体办法，同时对去年和前年参加企业的初中、高小毕业生，如已晋到三、四级的人，应规定二、三年内不再升级的办法。
                    青工　王术桐
    徒工工资不合理吗？
    我在旧社会也作过两年学徒，在一家药房是学生意。吃饭时，我的两眼就要看着店主、店娘们吃，他们碗里只剩一口饭的时候，就得赶快用双手去添饭，稍一迟延，就要遭白眼。为了学几个英文药名，就得将每月两斗米的薪金（约合现在四元钱）拿出一斗半来交给店主。没有星期天，每天工作至少十七小时，一打盹，就要挨骂。这种痛苦的生活，至今回想起来还难过。
    现在的学徒工每天八小时工作，一进厂就学技术，每月还有二十五元工资，待遇还低吗？希望你们听听过去在旧社会学过徒的人的谈话，那就会感到现在自己是在乐园中了。
                            孔志和
    想一想，徒工们
    你们在人民的培养和关怀下，从学校走进了工厂，老师傅耐心教你们技术，国家还给你们很高报酬。你们应感谢党和人民的教育。可是，你们今天没有给国家创造财富，反而在那里争论工资。
    过去我们学徒的时候，每天太阳没出来就起床，晚上不到九点不能睡觉，没有星期日，有时还受打受骂。这样苦熬了三年，所挣的工资只不过等于你们现在一个月的工资。
    你们现在在现代化的工厂里，做着极轻的体力劳动，学着先进的技术，吃的是大米白面，住的是高楼，比过去要强百倍千倍，我看真是天堂。
                  老工人　赵玉振
    不该延长徒工晋级时间
    许多老师傅认为现在的徒工晋级太快，工资太高。我认为这些意见是迎风拍马。我在旧社会里当过三年多的学徒。在这三年当中，我的工作是抱小孩、烧饭、担水、扫地、倒便壶等，不是学技术，而是作佣人。1954年我一考进了技工学校，就整天和机器打交道，在一年半的时间里，就掌握了四级工技术。难道我们有了相当的技术，就不应当有相当的级别吗？让有相当技术的徒工延长晋级，这不是资本主义社会的剥削行为吗？我认为延长徒工晋级的时间是不合理的。
                  “录音收音机”
    现在徒工跟过去不一样
    有的老师傅把现在的徒工与过去的徒工相比，这是不恰当的，旧社会里的学徒不懂文化，老师傅又保守，不肯教，学徒只是做零七八碎活的活计。现在学徒都有一定的文化，老师傅不保守，学徒能专心一意地学技术，所以技术提高得很快。现在徒工的晋级并不是都快了，不能一概而论。按劳取酬是社会主义的优越性，如果徒工达到技工水平，就应该晋级，不能因一部分人而涉及整体，这样很容易造成老师傅与徒工的矛盾。
                          “一群”
    维护社会主义利益
    我们坚决支持刘学熹的意见和老工人们的意见。“录音收音机”和“一群”的意见是错误的。你们认为老工人的意见是“迎风拍马”。就算是“迎风拍马”，但是他们迎的是社会主义的风，拍的是社会主义的马，他们是维护社会主义利益，还有什么不好？老师傅们的技术是来之不易的，我们应该很好地向他们学习，不能因为自己有点文化，就瞧不起他们。晋级太快是会助长骄傲自满情绪的。我厂有些初中毕业生，学习一年，回厂就评为三级、四级工，可是和老师傅比，无论是技术、经验都相差很远，技术是很窄的。延长学徒期限，对国家和徒工本身都是有利的。根本谈不上什么资本主义剥削。正如老工人所讲的，青年人的文化和技术还不是国家培养出来的。我们应该感谢党和国家，感谢老师傅们。
