    Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, China Democratic League, China Association for Promoting Democracy, Jiusan Society, and China Zhi Gong Party
    To Convene National Rectification Work Conferences

    Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd - The Central Standing Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held its 15th meeting (expanded) on the 2nd. The meeting decided to convene a work conference on the entire party's rectification movement on September 12th to further clarify the policies and guidelines of the anti-rightist struggle, exchange preliminary experiences in the entire party's anti-rightist struggle, and mobilize the entire party to carry out the anti-rightist struggle in depth and breadth.
    At the meeting, Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, explained the issue of convening a work conference on the entire party's rectification movement. Chen Cisheng, Deputy Director of the Central Rectification Office, reported on the situation of the entire party's anti-rightist struggle in the past two months.
    Chen Cisheng said that the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang organizations in various places generally began to carry out the anti-rightist struggle within the party since late June. As of August 31st, according to incomplete statistics of the materials received, a total of 439 rightist elements had been exposed by the party organizations in various places. This statistic shows that the activities of rightist elements within the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang are serious. It is estimated that more rightist elements will be exposed as the movement deepens and develops.
    Chen Cisheng said that in the two months of struggle, the organizations in various places have also gained many good experiences and practices in their actual work: First, truly accepting the leadership of the Communist Party in every link of the anti-rightist struggle can strengthen the combat power and accelerate victory. Second, combining the exposure and criticism of rightists with the Provincial or Municipal People's Congress, forming a broad and strong anti-rightist front from within our party to all sectors of society, is conducive to boosting morale and achieving victory. Third, flexibly using tactics, most local organizations have shifted from the method of exposing and criticizing at large meetings to a combination of large and small meetings, which has proven to be effective in most cases.
    Chen Cisheng finally said that as the anti-rightist struggle is universally carried out and deepened throughout the country, we must closely follow the development of the situation and expand the struggle more widely and deeply to every grassroots organization.
    Mei Gongbin, Li Shizhang, Chen Shaoxian, Zhu Xuefan, Zhu Yunshan and others also spoke at the meeting.
    Finally, the meeting exchanged views on the People's Daily editorial of August 29th, "The Serious Task of All Democratic Parties," in light of the actual situation of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang organizations.
    Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd - The central rectification leading groups of the China Democratic League, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, and the Jiusan Society and other democratic parties have recently held rectification leadership group meetings, and have decided to convene work conferences on rectification for all levels of organizations in each party nationwide. The China Democratic League and the China Association for Promoting Democracy's rectification work conferences are scheduled to be held on September 10th, and the Jiusan Society's rectification work conference is scheduled to be held on September 12th.
    The purpose of these democratic parties convening national rectification work conferences is to further clarify the guidelines and tasks of the anti-rightist struggle, exchange struggle experiences, so as to carry out this struggle more deeply and comprehensively in organizations at all levels, and ensure that organizations at all levels achieve a complete victory in the anti-rightist struggle.
    At the meeting of the Central Rectification Leading Group of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the report made by Yang Dongpo, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, on rectifying the work of the Beijing Municipal Committee Rectification Leading Group of the China Association for Promoting Democracy was also adopted. Yang Dongpo pointed out that, in order to reverse the phenomenon of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy being unenthusiastic in the anti-rightist struggle, the convener of the Central Rectification Leading Group of the China Association for Promoting Democracy had already decided on August 30th to remove Lei Jieqiong from her position as convener of the Beijing Municipal Committee Rectification Leading Group, and replace her with Feng Binfu, Deputy Director of the Central Rectification Office of the China Association for Promoting Democracy.
    This newspaper reports: The administrative meeting of the Central Standing Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party and the Central Rectification Leading Group held a joint meeting on September 2nd, unanimously resolving: In order to deepen the anti-rightist struggle within the China Zhi Gong Party and develop the rectification movement to the grassroots, it was decided to convene the Second Enlarged Meeting of the Sixth Central Committee Rectification Work Conference in Beijing on September 11th. In addition to members of the Central Committee and alternate members of the Central Committee, representatives of the rectification leading groups of various levels of organizations will also participate in this meeting.

    民革、民盟、民进、九三学社和致公党
    将召开全国整风工作会议
    据新华社3日讯　中国国民党革命委员会中央常务委员会在2日举行第十五次会议（扩大）。会议决定在9月12日召开全党整风运动工作会议，以进一步明确反右派斗争的政策方针，交流全党反右派斗争的初步经验，动员全党深入和广泛地开展反右派斗争。
    会上，民革主席李济深就召开全党整风运动工作会议问题作了说明。中央整风办公室副主任陈此生报告了近两月来全党反右派斗争的情况。
    陈此生说，民革各地组织一般自6月下旬起先后开始进行党内的反右派斗争。到8月31日为止，根据已收到的不完全的材料统计，全党各地组织已揭露的右派分子有四百三十九人，这个统计表明，民革党内右派分子活动的情况是严重的。估计运动在深入和发展中还会揭发出更多的右派分子。
    陈此生说，在两个多月的斗争中，各地组织在实际工作中也有了不少的好的体会与做法：一、在反右派斗争的每一环节上，真正接受共产党的领导，即可以加强战斗力量，加速胜利。二、结合省或市人民代表大会揭露批判右派，组成从我们党内到社会各界的广大坚强的反右派战线，有利于鼓舞士气，克敌致果。三、灵活运用战术，多数地方组织已由大会揭发批判的方式，进而采用大会与小会相结合的斗争方式，多数事例证明是行之有效的。
    陈此生最后说，反右派斗争在全国范围普遍开展和深入，我们必须紧紧跟上形势的发展，使斗争更广泛更深入的展开到每一基层组织去。
    在会上发言的，还有梅龚彬、李世璋、陈劭先、朱学范、朱蕴山等人。
    最后，会议就人民日报8月29日社论：“各民主党派的严重任务”，联系民革组织的实际情况，交换了意见。
    据新华社3日讯　中国民主同盟、中国民主促进会和九三学社等民主党派中央最近分别举行的整风领导小组会议，都决定召开各党派在全国各级组织中进行整风的工作会议。中国民主同盟和中国民主促进会的整风工作会议决定在9月10日举行，九三学社的整风工作会议决定在9月12日举行。
    这些民主党派召开全国整风工作会议的目的，是为了进一步明确反右派斗争的方针任务，交流斗争经验，以便在各级组织中更深入、全面地开展这一斗争，保证各级组织在反右派斗争中取得彻底胜利。
    在民进中央整风领导小组会议上，还通过了民进中央常务委员杨东蒪作的关于整顿民进北京市委整风领导小组工作的报告。杨东蒪指出，为了扭转民进北京市委反右派斗争不积极现象，民进中央整风领导小组召集人已经在8月30日决定撤销雷洁琼的北京市委整风领导小组召集人职务，改由民进中央整风办公室副主任冯宾符担任。
    本报讯　中国致公党中央常务委员会行政会议和中央整风领导小组于9月2日举行联席会议，一致决议：为了在致公党内深入开展反右派斗争，把整风运动发展到基层去，决定于9月11日在北京召开第六届中央委员会第二次扩大会议整风工作会议。参加这次会议的，除中央委员候补中央委员外，还有各级组织的整风领导小组的代表。
