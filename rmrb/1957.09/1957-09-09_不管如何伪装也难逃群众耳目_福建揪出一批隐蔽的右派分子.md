Fujian Unearths a Group of Hidden Rightists

(Xinhua News Agency dispatch) Fujian Province has uncovered a batch of hidden rightists in various agencies.

Li Peiteng, a rightist in the Longyan County Post and Telecommunications Bureau, not only exploited the weaknesses of another rightist, Lin Shengbin, secretly fabricating various materials to supply and support Lin Shengbin in attacking the Communist Party and Socialism. After Lin Shengbin was exposed and criticized, he also incited Lin Shengbin on how to make a false self-criticism, attempting to help Lin Shengbin muddle through and cover himself. However, with the deepening of the struggle, his ugly face was finally exposed. Chen Binghua, Ye Yisheng, and others, employees of the Nanping Air Traffic Control Office, after being educated by the anti-rightist struggle and distinguishing right from wrong, also exposed Qi Guoxuan, a cleverly disguised rightist backbone. This cunning rightist either remained silent or raised trivial questions at the forum, while secretly dressing himself up as a "good person" with "sympathy," using individual talks and deceiving superiors to collude with and instigate a small group of people dissatisfied with the Communist Party, frantically attacking the Party.

    福建揪出一批隐蔽的右派分子
    本报讯　福建省各地机关揭发出了一批隐蔽的右派分子。
    龙岩县邮电局的右派分子李培腾，他不但利用另一右派分子林生彬的弱点，背地捏造各种材料供给和支持林生彬向共产党向社会主义进攻；在林生彬被揭发批判后，他又教唆林生彬如何作假检讨，企图帮林生彬蒙混过关，来掩护自己。但，随着斗争的深入开展，他的丑恶面貌终被揭露。南平航管处职工陈秉华、叶仪生等在受到反右派斗争的教育，辨明了是非后，也揭发出了一个巧妙伪装起来的右派骨干分子齐国瑄。这个狡猾的右派分子在鸣放座谈会上不是一言不发，就是提了一些小问题，在暗地里则又打扮成一个富有“同情心”的“好人”，运用个别谈心、欺上瞒下等手段拉拢和煽动一小撮对共产党不满的分子，猖狂向党进攻。（新华社专稿）
