Kunming, September 28th (By our newspaper) More than two hundred units in Kunming City, while deepening the rectification campaign, are actively improving their work.

Many units have established committees or groups for improving work, specifically responsible for collecting, studying, and handling various opinions raised by the masses. The Kunming Motor Factory sorted out 141 issues urgently needing resolution and capable of being resolved, raised by the masses, and addressed them and provided public responses within a week.

During the process of rectification and immediate correction, in order to strengthen the grassroots, various government agencies have transferred a large number of capable cadres back to their original production posts. According to incomplete statistics, municipal-level agencies have already transferred more than 290 people, including some responsible cadres at the section level and above.

    昆明各单位积极改进工作
    本报昆明28日电　昆明市已有二百多个单位，在深入整风的同时，积极改进工作。
    许多单位都成立了改进工作的委员会或小组，专门负责汇集、研究及处理群众提出的各种意见。昆明电机厂把群众提出的需要迫切解决而又可能解决的问题整理出一百四十一条，在一周内分别作了处理和公开的答复。
    在边整边改中，为了充实基层，各机关单位下放了大批得力干部回到原生产岗位。据不完全统计，市级机关已下放了二百九十多人，其中有一些是科级以上的负责干部。
