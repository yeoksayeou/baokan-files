Xinhua News Agency, September 9th. A joint meeting of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA) and the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC), focusing on promoting a comprehensive rectification movement in the national business community, opened in Beijing today.

Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the CDNCA, delivered the opening address at the meeting. He solemnly announced to everyone: This is a mobilization meeting for the national business community to resolutely take the socialist road, and this is a mobilization meeting to welcome a new upsurge in socialist transformation.

A total of 219 members of the CDNCA Central Committee and the ACFIC Executive Committee attended the meeting. Ninety-six representatives from relevant departments of the central government and various provinces and cities were also invited to attend the meeting as non-voting delegates.

Huang Yanpei said that the central task of this meeting is to discuss the principles, policies, and arrangements for carrying out a comprehensive rectification campaign in the national business community, clarify thinking, unify understanding, and set off a new upsurge in socialist transformation. In order to accomplish this task well, the meeting will conduct full and repeated discussions on major issues related to the comprehensive rectification campaign in the business community.

Huang Yanpei said that the majority of the business community supports socialism, supports the leadership of the working class, and is willing to follow the Communist Party. However, it is undeniable that when the right-wing elements launched a frantic attack, a considerable number of industrialists and businessmen experienced significant wavering and right-leaning tendencies in politics. This proves that the issue of the political stance of the majority of people in the business community has not yet been resolved. Recently, Li Weihan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Eighth Office of the State Council, made a speech proposing that the business community should comprehensively launch a rectification movement with the content of opposing the right-wing, breaking the capitalist stand, and establishing the socialist stand. Huang Yanpei expressed his complete agreement and support for this speech. He said, "We are extremely grateful to the Party for its concern for the business community. The CDNCA and the ACFIC must, under the leadership of the Party, undertake the glorious task of promoting the comprehensive rectification of the national business community, which is of historical significance."

Subsequently, Chen Shutong, Chairman of the ACFIC, delivered a report to the conference on behalf of the Standing Committee of the CDNCA Central Committee and the Standing Committee of the ACFIC, entitled "National Industrialists and Businessmen, Resolutely Defeat the Right-Wing, Actively Participate in Rectification, and Strive to Usher in a New Upsurge in Political and Ideological Acceptance of Socialist Transformation." In his report, Chen Shutong clarified the importance of carrying out a comprehensive rectification movement in the business community and elaborated on the principles, policies, and steps for carrying out this movement. The report provided a detailed analysis and explanation of some of the existing problems in the ideological understanding of the business community and some policy issues in the rectification movement of the business community.

    推动全国工商界全面整风
    民建中央和工商联执委会举行联席会议
    新华社9日讯　以推动全国工商界开展全面整风运动为中心内容的民主建国会中央委员会和全国工商联执行委员会联席会议，今天在北京开幕。
    民主建国会主任委员黄炎培在会上致开幕词。他庄严地向大家宣布：这是一个全国工商界坚决走社会主义道路的誓师大会，这是一个迎接社会主义改造新高潮的动员大会。
    出席这次会议的民建中央委员和全国工商联执行委员共有二百十九人。中央和各省市的有关部门，也有九十六位代表应邀列席了这次会议。
    黄炎培说，这次会议的中心任务是：讨论在全国工商界开展全面整风的方针、政策、部署等问题，澄清思想，统一认识，掀起一个社会主义改造的新高潮。为了很好地完成这一任务，会议将对有关工商界全面整风的重大问题，充分地、反复地进行讨论。
    黄炎培说，工商界的大多数是赞成社会主义的，是拥护工人阶级的领导，愿意跟着共产党走的。但是，毋庸讳言，当右派分子猖狂进攻的时候，相当多的工商业者在政治上曾经发生显著的动摇和右倾，这就证明，工商界中的多数人政治立场问题还没有解决。最近，中共中央统一战线工作部部长、国务院第八办公室主任李维汉发表谈话，提出工商界应该全面开展一个以反对右派、破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场为内容的整风运动，黄炎培表示完全同意和拥护这一谈话。他说，“我们万分感激党对工商界的关怀。民建会和工商联一定要在党的领导下，担负起推动全国工商界进行全面整风这一具有历史意义的光荣任务。”
    接着，全国工商联主任委员陈叔通代表民建中央常务委员会和全国工商联常务委员会，向大会作了题为“全国工商业者，坚决打垮右派，积极参加整风，为掀起在政治上、思想上接受社会主义改造的新高潮而奋斗”的报告。陈叔通在报告中阐明了在工商界开展全面整风运动的重要意义和开展这一运动的方针、政策和步骤。报告对于当前工商界在思想认识上存在的一些问题和工商界整风运动中的若干政策问题，作了详尽的分析和解释。
