Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 5th. New grain has begun to be stored in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

After undergoing socialist education, farmers in Liangcheng and Tuoketuo Counties in the Autonomous Region have distinguished between right and wrong on the issue of grain. Agricultural cooperative members delivering grain to the granary said happily: The surplus grain we sell this year has been winnowed and sifted repeatedly, all to support national construction and aid people in disaster areas. The "May 3rd" Agricultural Cooperative in Chifeng County, Zhaowuda League, completed the task of selling 50,000 jin of new wheat in just a few days.

The quality of grain stored in the Autonomous Region this year is very good. New grain stored in places like Shanba Town and Liangcheng in the Yellow River Hetao area is all grade two or above. Of the more than 46,000 jin of wheat recently stored in Shanba Town, grades one and two accounted for 96%.
