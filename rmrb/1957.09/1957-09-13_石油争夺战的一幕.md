　　A Scene in the Oil Scramble
　　Xing Xiangchao
　　In March of this year, the manager of the Iranian National Oil Company, Bayat, and the Italian National Oil Company began negotiations on an oil agreement. However, before the Iranian parliament could approve the agreement, Bayat suddenly died on May 10. Bayat's death was bizarre, and for months the entire city of Tehran discussed the cause of his death. It was not until recently that rumors spread that this was the work of the American secret service, which poisoned him to obstruct the Italian-Iranian oil agreement.
　　Bayat was the manager of the Iranian National Oil Company. In April of this year, through his efforts, the Iranian National Oil Company agreed to negotiate an agreement with Italy on the development of Iranian oil. This agreement stipulated that the Italian National Oil Company and the Iranian National Oil Company would jointly establish a company, each holding half of the shares. This company would obtain oil exploitation rights in three regions of Iran, covering a total area of 23,000 square kilometers. These three regions are the shallow continental shelf north of the Persian Gulf, the inland area east of the central Zagros Mountains, and the coastal area along the Gulf of Oman. After formal oil production, Italy and Iran will share profits in the ratio of 25% and 75%, respectively.
　　In August, the Iranian parliament's Senate and House of Representatives approved this agreement.
　　This profit-sharing ratio between Italy and Iran aroused the anger of the American oil monopoly groups. The American oil monopoly groups have always distributed profits with Middle Eastern oil-producing countries on a 50-50 basis. Now, the Italian-Iranian oil agreement broke this convention, undoubtedly challenging America's monopoly position. If Middle Eastern oil-producing countries all demanded to distribute profits according to the terms of the Italian General Directorate of Petroleum Industry, the United States would have a big headache. Therefore, the American press attacked Italy's activities, saying, "It is like putting a gun to the heads of American and other Western European major oil companies."
　　As everyone knows, Italy is the location of America's so-called "demonstration" base, and America's first atomic unit is stationed there. Since 1953, Iran has been an object that the United States has tried to control. American oil monopoly groups have already extended their claws into Iranian oil fields. Therefore, the Italian-Iranian oil agreement not only harmed the interests of American monopoly capital but also demonstrated an independent tendency to break away from American control. This naturally made the American ruling group even more dissatisfied.
　　The United States put pressure on Iran. First, the former Ala cabinet in Iran, which was responsible for negotiating with Italy, collapsed under the direct intervention of the American Embassy in Iran. Then, American agents threatened Bayat, the manager of the Iranian National Oil Company, and threatened to assassinate him. However, these intimidations failed to make Bayat compromise, so the American secret service poisoned him with slow-acting poison disguised as medicine, killing Bayat, who was seeking medical treatment for an illness.
　　But Iran finally did not yield. The King of Iran publicly announced on July 29: "Someone suggested to us that we should get along well with the foreign oil tycoons. We have no warlike intentions. If we follow a recognized peaceful policy on oil issues, then the increased oil revenue under the new law is our right. This has nothing to do with anyone!"
　　The United States also put pressure on Italy, attempting to force Italy to abandon its decision to develop Iranian oil. "The New York Times" threatened Italy, saying that if Italy did not obey the manipulation of the international oil cartel, American companies would stop supplying raw materials to Italian oil refineries. The United States also openly expressed dissatisfaction with Italian President Gronchi's visit to Iran. But this also did not make Italy yield. American pressure aroused angry rebuttals from Italian public opinion. Italian President Gronchi led a group of international trade experts to visit Iran on the 8th of this month. On the same day, the Italian-Iranian oil agreement was formally signed in Tehran. In the joint communique of the meeting between Gronchi and the King of Iran, Pahlavi, it was also specifically mentioned that "the composition of the Italian-Iranian Oil Company is an example illustrating the possibility of cooperation between the two countries."
　　In the past, although American oil companies shared profits with Middle Eastern oil-producing countries on a 50-50 basis, the actual income of Middle Eastern countries was far less than 50%, and they still had to rely on "American aid." The Italian-Iranian oil agreement gave the Middle Eastern oil-producing countries an enlightenment: there are buyers abroad, and there is oil underground. They can completely avoid begging for scraps from American monopoly capital while holding a golden rice bowl.
　　The Italian-Iranian oil agreement is an important sign that, due to the development of peaceful and neutral tendencies in the world and the competition within the capitalist world, American monopoly groups cannot sit firmly on the heads of the Middle Eastern people and exploit them as they wish, which is what makes the United States uneasy.

### 石油争夺战的一幕

　　石油争夺战的一幕
　　邢象超
　　今年3月间，伊朗国家石油公司经理巴雅特和意大利国家石油公司开始了石油协定谈判。可是，还未等到伊朗议会批准这一协定，巴雅特就在5月10日突然死去了。巴雅特死的离奇，几个月来整个德黑兰都在议论他的死因。直到最近，才传出这是美国特务机关为了阻挠意大利—伊朗石油协定而下的毒手。
    巴雅特是伊朗国家石油公司的经理。今年4月间，由他经手，伊朗国家石油公司同意大利谈判了一项关于开发伊朗石油的协议。这项协议规定由意大利国家石油公司同伊朗国家石油公司合办一个公司，各占一半的股份。这个公司将在伊朗的三个地区、总面积二万三千平方公里的地方获得石油开采权。这三个地区是波斯湾北部大陆浅滩、中部扎格罗斯山脉以东的内地和阿曼湾沿海一带。在正式生产石油以后，意大利和伊朗将按25％和75％的比例分取利润。
    8月间，伊朗国会的参、众两院先后批准了这一协定。
    意大利同伊朗这个分配利润的比例引起了美国石油垄断集团的愤怒。美国石油垄断集团一向按对半的比例和中东产油国家分配利润，现在意大利—伊朗石油协定打破了这个常规，无疑是向美国的垄断地位挑战。如果中东出产石油的国家都提出按意大利石油工业总管理局的条件分配利润的要求，美国就要大伤脑筋。因此，美国报刊对意大利的活动大肆攻击说，“它等于把一支枪顶住美国和其它西欧大石油公司的头上”。
    大家知道，意大利是美国的所谓“示范”基地的所在国，美国的第一支原子部队就驻扎在那里。伊朗从1953年以来，就一直是美国力图加以控制的对象。美国石油垄断集团已经把它的爪子伸进了伊朗的油田。因此，意大利—伊朗石油协定不仅危害了美国垄断资本的利益，而且表现了一种摆脱美国控制的独立倾向。这自然使美国统治集团更加不满。
    美国对伊朗施加了压力。首先，负责同意大利进行谈判的伊朗前阿拉内阁在美国驻伊朗大使馆的直接干涉下垮台了。接着，美国特务又对伊朗国家石油公司经理巴雅特进行威胁，扬言要对他施加人身狙击。但是，这些恐吓都不能使巴雅特妥协，美国特务机关便下了毒手，用慢性毒药伪装药品，害死了因病就医的巴雅特。
    但是伊朗终于没有屈服。伊朗国王在7月29日公开宣布说：“有人向我们建议，应当同外国石油大王搞好关系。我们没有好战的意图。如果在石油问题上遵循公认的和平政策，那么按照新的法律所增加的石油收入是我们的权利。这与谁也不相干！”
    美国对意大利也施加压力，企图迫使意大利放弃开发伊朗石油的决定。“纽约时报”威胁意大利说，如果意大利不服从国际石油卡特尔的操纵，美国公司就要停止给意大利炼油工厂供应原料。美国对于意大利总统格隆基访问伊朗，也公开表示不满。但是，这也没有使意大利就范。美国的压力引起了意大利舆论的愤怒反击。意大利总统格隆基在本月8日率领一批国际贸易专家到伊朗访问。就在这一天，意大利和伊朗的石油协定在德黑兰正式签订。在格隆基和伊朗国王巴列维的会谈公报中，还特别提到“意伊石油公司的组成是说明这两国进行合作的可能性的例证”。
    过去美国石油公司虽和中东产油国家按对半比例分红，但是中东国家实际所得远低于50％，因而还得依靠“美援”。意大利—伊朗石油协定给了中东产石油的国家一个启示：国外有买主，地下又有石油，他们完全可以不必捧着个金饭碗向美国垄断资本去乞讨残汤剩肴。
    意大利—伊朗石油协定是一个重要的迹象，说明由于世界上和平中立倾向的发展和资本主义世界内部的竞争，美国垄断集团不可能稳若泰山地坐在中东人民的头上，如心如意地剥削中东人民，这也就是使美国感到不安的地方。
