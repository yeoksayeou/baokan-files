Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The Chinese Academy of Sciences held a symposium in Beijing today to continue criticizing the anti-socialist scientific program proposed by the Zhang-Luo alliance and the political conspiracy of the rightists to restore bourgeois sociology and economics.

Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, gave a speech at the meeting entitled "The Anti-Rightist Struggle in the Social Sciences Must Be Further Deepened." Guo Moruo said that the anti-rightist struggle has made all our scientific workers more deeply aware of the importance and necessity of ideological remolding. Philosophy and social sciences are sciences with particularly strong class character and Party spirit. Workers in philosophy and social sciences directly undertake the task of ideological education for the people. They should more conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism, thoroughly transform their thinking, truly stand under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, and fight for the great cause of socialism and communism. (The full text can be found on pages 2 and 3 of today's newspaper)

Xia Kangnong, Hou Wailu, Qi Yanming, and Sun Dingguo spoke at today's meeting.

In their speeches, Hou Wailu and Sun Dingguo gave a detailed analysis of the important anti-communist and anti-socialist articles published by rightist Fei Xiaotong in Wenhui Daily, "A Few Words About Sociology," and in the forum convened by the "Zhengming" monthly magazine, and Wu Jingchao's "Improving the Quality of Suggestions from Democratic Parties" published in the "CPPCC Newsletter". They pointed out that the publication of these articles was to brew and publicize the basic ideas of the Zhang-Luo alliance's anti-socialist scientific program. They also analyzed in detail the short commentary published in Guangming Daily on June 9 entitled "Opening Up a New Path for Mutual Supervision" to prove the very important position occupied by the anti-socialist scientific program proposed by the Zhang-Luo alliance in the entire deployment of the bourgeois rightists' rampant attack on the Communist Party and socialism. Hou Wailu and Sun Dingguo's speeches focused on elaborating on some important arguments in Guo Moruo's speech.

Xia Kangnong said that Fei Xiaotong not only followed the wishes of the Zhang-Luo alliance, provided materials and arguments for the reactionary group's criminal activities, but also used his "gloomy intelligence" to participate in the reactionary group's drafting of plans and strategies. Xia Kangnong said that Fei Xiaotong, on the one hand, slandered the Party's correct policy of winning over, uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals, and negated the Party's major achievements in intellectuals; on the other hand, he claimed to be the so-called "representative of the interests of intellectuals," catered to the backward side of bourgeois intellectuals, and falsely accused the leadership of the Communist Party and the ideological education of Marxism-Leninism as two "lids" on intellectuals; he incited bourgeois intellectuals who were dissatisfied with the Communist Party and the socialist system to rise up against the leadership of the Communist Party, against the people's democratic dictatorship, and against the study of Marxism-Leninism. Fei Xiaotong viciously portrayed our country's political life as being shrouded in the terrifying atmosphere of "Don't talk about state affairs after dinner," just like in the Kuomintang era; and he described the scientific research work and the teaching work of universities and colleges under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government as a mess, and then came to the conclusion that the Communist Party had messed up cultural and educational work and other work. In this way, the Communist Party "should" step down and let the bourgeois rightists, first of all the Zhang-Luo alliance, take power. He believed that the bourgeois rightist intellectuals had "talent" and "expertise," and suggested that the Zhang-Luo alliance quickly take charge of intellectuals and cultural and educational undertakings, and let the Democratic League replace the Communist Party in leading scientific and cultural and educational undertakings, and then further seize the Communist Party's leadership over other aspects of the country's work.

Qi Yanming revealed that Fei Xiaotong firmly opposed the ideological remolding of intellectuals in his work in the Expert Bureau, and completely dismissed the great improvements made by the Party in the work of intellectuals after the Intellectuals Conference, and even used rumors and slander to provoke the relationship between intellectuals and the Party. After the policy of a hundred schools of thought contending, long-term coexistence, and mutual supervision was put forward, Fei Xiaotong took advantage of this opportunity to create the so-called "two concerns" of intellectuals, namely the so-called "business concerns and political concerns"; or two "depressions," namely the so-called "academic atmosphere depression" and "political atmosphere depression." According to Fei Xiaotong, the main reason for the "academic atmosphere depression" was ideological remolding, and the reason for the "political atmosphere depression" was the so-called "lack of democracy and freedom." Fei Xiaotong used this to incite dissatisfied bourgeois intellectuals to rise up against the Communist Party.

Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, and Chen Zhenhan continued to make some explanations at the meeting today.

More than two hundred scientific workers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, universities and colleges in Beijing, relevant central departments, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places attended the symposium. The meeting will continue tomorrow.

　　科学界高举马克思主义旗帜追击右派
　　保卫哲学社会科学的党性
    据新华社18日讯　中国科学院今天在北京召开座谈会，继续批判章罗联盟提出的反社会主义科学纲领和右派企图恢复资产阶级社会学、经济学的政治阴谋。
    中国科学院院长郭沫若以“社会科学界反右派斗争必须进一步深入”为题在会上讲了话。郭沫若说，反右派斗争使得我们所有的科学工作者，更加深刻地认识到思想改造的重要性和必要性。哲学社会科学是阶级性党性特别强烈的科学，哲学社会科学工作者直接担负着对人民群众进行思想教育的任务，更应该认真地学习马克思列宁主义，彻底改造自己的思想，真正站到马克思列宁主义的旗帜下，为社会主义和共产主义的伟大事业而战斗。（全文见今天本报第二、三版）
    在今天的会议上发言的有夏康农、侯外庐、齐燕铭和孙定国。
    侯外庐和孙定国在发言中，详细分析了右派分子费孝通在文汇报上发表的“关于社会学，说几句话”和在“争鸣”月刊召集的座谈会上的发言，吴景超发表在“政协会刊”上的“提高民主党派建议的质量”这几篇重要的反共反社会主义文章。他们指出，这些文章的发表，是为了酝酿和宣传章罗联盟的反社会主义科学纲领的基本思想。他们还详细分析了光明日报6月9日发表的题为“为互相监督开拓了新路”的短评，来证明章罗联盟提出的反社会主义的科学纲领，在资产阶级右派向共产党向社会主义猖狂进攻的整个部署中所占有的十分重要的地位。侯外庐和孙定国的发言，着重发挥了郭沫若讲话中的一些重要论点。
    夏康农说，费孝通不仅秉承章罗联盟的意旨，为这个反动集团的罪恶活动，提供材料，制造论据，并且用他的“阴暗的聪明”，参加这个反动集团拟订计划和策略。夏康农说，费孝通一面污蔑党对知识分子的争取、团结、教育、改造的正确政策，抹煞党在知识分子方面的重大成绩；一面以所谓“知识分子利益代表者”自居，迎合资产阶级知识分子落后的一面，诬指共产党的领导和马克思列宁主义的思想教育是压在知识分子身上的两个“盖子”；煽动对共产党、对社会主义制度心怀不满的资产阶级知识分子起来反对共产党的领导，反对人民民主专政，反对学习马克思列宁主义。费孝通把我们国家的政治生活恶毒地描绘得像国民党时代一样，笼罩着“茶余酒后，休谈国事”的恐怖气氛；并且把共产党和人民政府领导下的科学研究工作和高等学校的教学工作描写得一塌糊涂，然后得出一个结论，说共产党把文教工作和其它工作一概办糟了。这样，共产党就“理应”下台，让资产阶级右派首先是章罗联盟上台。他认为资产阶级右派的知识分子中“有人才”、“有专长”，建议章罗联盟赶快把知识分子和文教事业抓起来，由民盟来代替共产党领导科学文教事业，然后进一步夺取共产党对国家的其它方面的工作的领导权。
    齐燕铭揭露费孝通在专家局工作中坚决反对知识分子思想改造，并把党在知识分子会议后在知识分子工作中的巨大改进一笔抹煞，甚至用造谣污蔑的办法挑拨知识分子同党的关系。在学术上的百家争鸣和长期共存、互相监督的方针提出后，费孝通更利用这个机会，制造出所谓知识分子的“两个顾虑”，即所谓“业务上的顾虑和政治上的顾虑”；或两个“沉闷”即所谓“学术空气的沉闷”和“政治空气的沉闷”。据费孝通说，“学术空气沉闷”的主要原因是思想改造，“政治空气沉闷”的原因是所谓“没有民主自由”，费孝通以此来煽动心怀不满的资产阶级知识分子起来反对共产党。
    费孝通、吴景超和陈振汉今天在会上继续作了一些交代。
    参加这次座谈会的，有中国科学院、北京各高等学校和中央有关部门、上海、天津等地的科学工作者两百多人。会议明天将继续进行。
