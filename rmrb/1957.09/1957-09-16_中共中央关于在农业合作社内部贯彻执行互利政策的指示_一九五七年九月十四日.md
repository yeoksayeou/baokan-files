The correct implementation of the mutual benefit policy between poor and middle peasants was one of the fundamental factors for us to rely on the poor peasants and unite with the middle peasants to smoothly complete agricultural cooperation. It is also an important guarantee for consolidating cooperatives in the future.

When realizing cooperation, the focus of implementing the mutual benefit policy was mainly on rationally handling the issue of means of production joining the cooperative. After the realization of cooperation, the focus of the mutual benefit policy is mainly to appropriately adjust the income issues between various members, especially between poor and middle peasants, through reasonable division of labor in production and reasonable distribution. The current situation is: After poor and lower-middle peasants joined the cooperative, the vast majority of them have increased their income compared to before joining the cooperative due to the implementation of the principle of distribution according to labor. However, there are also a small number of households with few laborers and many family members whose income has decreased compared to before joining the cooperative. After upper-middle peasants and some non-agricultural laborers joined the cooperative, their labor income falls into three categories: some have increased, some have maintained their original level, and some have temporarily decreased. There are many reasons for this latter situation, mainly because the production level of the cooperative in its initial stage cannot be quickly improved; at the same time, it is also due to the insufficient understanding of the importance of the mutual benefit policy by some comrades, and there are some shortcomings in its implementation. Therefore, it is necessary to earnestly implement the mutual benefit policy while actively increasing production, and rationally adjust the economic interests between various groups within the cooperative, especially to achieve mutual benefit between poor and middle peasants. This is of great significance for strengthening unity within the cooperative and consolidating the cooperative.

To this end, based on existing experience and the spirit of the mutual benefit policy, the following points are proposed:

One, For members who may have reduced income, especially for poor and lower-middle peasant households with difficulties, appropriate consideration should be given to them in the division of labor in production (such as arranging odd jobs in field management) and in operating sideline occupations within the cooperative and at home, so that they can give full play to the role of auxiliary family labor and increase their income.

Two, Non-agricultural households whose income decreases after joining the cooperative should appropriately adjust their work. The original small vendors can organize a consignment sales and purchasing group with the consent of the commercial supply and marketing departments, and assign them to the management of the supply and marketing cooperative. Those who originally have other production skills (such as various handicrafts, etc.) should make full use of their production skills as much as possible to organize various handicraft production operated by the cooperative or individually. If it is operated by the cooperative, the labor work points should be appropriately adjusted according to their technical level to enable them to receive reasonable remuneration and increase income.

Three, For certain special means of production, such as fish ponds, reed fields, orchards, mulberry gardens, etc., where the original owner has invested more labor and now has a larger income, if they are small in quantity, they may not be included in the cooperative temporarily, either partially or completely, and managed by the original owner. Or after joining the cooperative, they are still contracted to the original owner for operation, implementing proportional profit sharing and giving appropriate consideration in contracting work and production to enable the original owner to increase a portion of income.

Four, Orchards and forests should be managed in a unified manner. However, it is the result of many years of labor. If the individual possession of the members varies greatly, it should generally be managed uniformly by the cooperative and implement proportional dividend. If it has been priced and included in the cooperative, and the members have many opinions, it can also be changed to proportional dividend, and it is stipulated that it will remain unchanged until the third five-year plan period. In mountainous and hilly areas where the forest possession of most members does not vary greatly, it can be priced and included in the cooperative, and the payment can be repaid in installments over the years.

Five, The surplus payment for means of production such as draught animals and farm tools that have been included in the cooperative and the investment of the members should be returned on schedule, and the due interest should be paid. If the price is too low and the members have many opinions, appropriate adjustments should be made according to the general market price at the time of joining the cooperative, but those that are basically reasonable will no longer be changed. Under normal years, if the above payments are delayed, it will inevitably weaken or lose the members' trust in the mutual benefit policy, and cause dissatisfaction among the original owners, which is very detrimental to consolidating the unity of the poor and middle peasants, consolidating the cooperative, and developing production. If the original repayment period is too short and cannot be repaid on schedule in reality, it should be negotiated with the original owner to extend it appropriately.

Six, In ethnic joint cooperatives in multi-ethnic areas, in addition to respecting the production, life and religious habits of the ethnic groups, attention must also be paid to mutual benefit in economic interests, especially to take care of the economic interests of members of ethnic minorities with fewer numbers.

Seven, In order to encourage the development of animal husbandry, in addition to the unified management by the cooperative, members should be allowed to raise a certain number of livestock at home, such as cattle, horses, mules, donkeys, etc., which are entirely owned by themselves. If the cooperative needs to use the draught animals of the members, appropriate rent should be paid.

Eight, For individual farmers, leadership should be strengthened to educate them to abide by government laws and strive for them to join the cooperative step by step under the principle of voluntariness.

Some of the above provisions have been made in the "Instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Doing a Good Job in Summer Harvest Distribution" on June 14, 1957, which should be studied and implemented together according to the specific conditions of various regions.

All the above work of adjusting the specific economic interests between various members, especially between poor and middle peasants, must be implemented through discussions among the members and full consultations with relevant parties, so that it can be implemented reasonably and rationally. We should educate cadres: within the cooperative, we must first rely on the original poor and lower-middle peasants and resolutely protect their interests, which is the foundation for consolidating the cooperative; at the same time, we should also earnestly pay attention to the interests of the upper-middle peasants. We should also explain to the poor and lower-middle peasants that under the premise of not harming their fundamental interests, giving appropriate consideration to the reasonable economic interests of the upper-middle peasants, and even making necessary concessions, to better unite them and seek a smoother consolidation of the cooperative, is in line with their long-term interests. At the same time, we must also educate the upper-middle peasants that for their own greater future interests, they should also take care of the interests of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and the poor and middle peasants should unite together and resolutely run the cooperative well. It should be pointed out that the upper-middle peasants are part of the laboring peasants, accounting for about 20% of the rural population, with higher production technology, and still have a certain influence on some old lower-middle peasants. Therefore, we should adhere to uniting with them. However, they (especially the old upper-middle peasants who had some exploitation income before joining the cooperative) have more capitalist tendencies, and are a class with wavering tendencies during the socialist transformation period. The vast majority of them joined the cooperative during the high tide of cooperation. Now most of them are willing to stay in the cooperative, a few want to withdraw from the cooperative, and carry out some activities that are not conducive to the cooperative. Therefore, we must not only unite with the upper-middle peasants, but also criticize and transform them (adopting persuasive education methods, and not allowing simple and rude methods). We will never allow accommodating these wavering upper-middle peasants in the direction of socialism. We must strengthen ideological leadership and criticize the capitalist ideas of these people. If we do not do this, we will make right-leaning mistakes. However, in economics, we should appropriately take care of the legitimate interests of these people, earnestly implement the mutual benefit policy, and should not harm their interests. If we do not do this, we will make left-leaning mistakes. In short, our unity with the upper-middle peasants must be based on the three conditions of first consolidating the superiority of the poor and lower-middle peasants within the cooperative, strengthening the ideological transformation of the wavering elements, and resolutely implementing the mutual benefit policy between the majority of peasants and the upper-middle peasants. Only in this way can we achieve the goal of truly uniting all the peasants, consolidating the cooperative, and developing agricultural production.

　　中共中央关于在农业合作社内部贯彻执行互利政策的指示
　　一九五七年九月十四日
    正确执行贫农和中农之间的互利政策，曾是我们实现依靠贫农联合中农顺利完成农业合作化的基本因素之一，也是今后巩固合作社的一个重要保证。
    在实现合作化的时候，实行互利政策的重点，主要是合理地处理生产资料入社的问题；合作化实现以后，互利政策的重点，主要是经过合理的生产分工和合理的分配，恰当地调节各社员之间，尤其是贫农和中农之间的收入问题。目前的情况是：贫农和下中农入社以后，由于按劳取酬原则的实行，绝大多数都比入社前的收入增加了，但是也有少数劳力少人口多的困难户比入社前的收入有所减少。上中农和部分非农业劳动的社员入社以后，他们的劳动收入分为三种情况：一部分人增加了，一部分人保持原有水平，一部分人暂时减少了。产生这后一种情况的原因很多，主要的是由于合作社初办时期的生产水平不可能很快提高；同时也还由于部分同志对互利政策的重要性认识不足，执行中存在着一些缺点。因此，有必要在积极地增加生产的同时，认真贯彻执行互利政策，合理地调整合作社内部各部分人之间的经济利益，特别是做到贫农和中农之间的互利，这对于加强社内团结、巩固合作社有很重大的意义。
    为此，根据现有的经验和互利政策的精神，提出如下各点：
    一、对于可能减少收入的社员，首先是对于贫农、下中农的困难户，应该在劳动生产分工上（如安排田间管理的零活时）和经营社内及家庭副业方面，给以适当的照顾，使他们能够充分发挥家庭辅助劳力的作用，增加自己的收入。
    二、非农业户在入社后减少收入者，应该适当地调整其工作。原来的小商贩，可以经过商业供销部门的同意组织代销代购小组，划归供销社管理。原来有其他生产技术的（如各种手工业等），应尽量利用其生产技术，组织合作社经营的或个人经营的各种手工业生产。如果是由社经营，则应按照他们技术水平的高低，适当地调整劳动工分，使能得到合理报酬，增加收入。
    三、某些特殊的生产资料，如鱼塘、苇地、果园、桑园等，原主投入劳力较多，现在收益较大，如果是属于小量的，可以部分或者全部暂不入社，归原主经营。或者入社后，仍然包给原主经营，实行比例分益，在包工包产上给予适当照顾，使原主能增加一部分收入。
    四、成片的果树、林木是应该统一经营的。但它是多年的劳动成果，如社员各人的占有悬殊较大者，一般应该由社统一经营，实行比例分红。已折价入社，如社员意见很多者，也可改为比例分红，并且规定直到第三个五年计划期内维持不变。在山区、丘陵区多数社员的林木占有悬殊不大者，可以折价入社，分年还款。
    五、对于入社的耕畜农具等生产资料多余的折价款和社员的投资，应该按期归还，并应付给应得的利息。如果折价过低，社员意见很多的，应按入社时的一般市价作适当的调整，但基本合理者不再变动。在正常年景下，上述款项如果拖延不还，必然会减弱或丧失社员对互利政策的信用，引起原所有主不满，这对于巩固贫、中农的团结，巩固合作社，发展生产是很不利的。如果原来规定的还清期限太短，事实上不能按期还清时，应同原主协商，适当延长。
    六、多民族地区的民族联合社，除必须尊重民族的生产、生活和宗教的习惯外，还必须注意在经济利益上的互利，特别是要照顾人数较少的少数民族社员的经济利益。
    七、为鼓励发展畜牧业，除了合作社统一经营以外，应该允许社员家庭饲养一定数量的家畜，如牛、马、骡、驴等，完全归自己所有。合作社如要使用社员的耕畜役畜时，应照付适当租金。
    八、对于个体农民，要加强领导，教育他们遵守政府法令，争取他们在自愿原则下，逐步地加入合作社。
    上述各项在1957年6月14日中共中央和国务院关于做好夏收分配工作的指示中，已经作了一些规定，应该根据各地具体情况一并研究执行。
    所有上述这些调整各社员之间，特别是贫农和中农之间具体经济利益的工作，都必须通过社员群众的讨论和有关方面的充分协商，使之合情合理地得到贯彻。我们应该教育干部：在合作社内部，首先必须依靠原来的贫农和下中农，坚决保护他们的利益，这是巩固合作社的基础；同时又应该切实注意上中农的利益。我们还应该向贫农、下中农说明，在不损害自己根本利益的前提下，对于上中农合理的经济利益给以适当的照顾，甚至作必要的某些让步，更好地团结他们，求得更顺利地巩固合作社，这是符合于自己的长远利益的。同时也必须教育上中农，为了自己将来更大的利益，他们也应该照顾贫农、下中农的利益，贫、中农团结在一起，坚决办好合作社。应该指出：上中农是劳动农民的一部分，他们占农村人口20％左右，生产技术较高，对于一部分老下中农还有一定的影响，因此，我们应该坚持对他们的团结。但是，他们（特别是入社前有部分剥削收入的老上中农）有较多的资本主义倾向，在社会主义改造时期，是具有动摇性的一个阶层。他们在合作化的高潮时期绝大部分加入了合作社，现在多数愿意留在合作社，少数要退社，并进行一些不利于合作社的活动。因此，我们对待上中农不只有团结的一面，还必须有批评改造的一面（采取说服教育的方法，不许用简单粗暴的方法）。我们在社会主义的方向上，决不许可迁就这些动摇的上中农。我们一定要加强思想领导，批判这些人的资本主义思想。我们如果不这样做，那就会犯右倾的错误。但是在经济上，我们应当适当照顾这些人的合理利益，认真执行互利政策，而不应当损害他们的利益。我们如果不这样做，那就会犯左倾的错误。总之，我们对于上中农的团结，必须建立在首先巩固合作社内部贫农和下中农的优势，加强对动摇分子的思想改造，和在多数农民与上中农之间坚决贯彻执行互利政策这样三个条件的基础之上。只有这样，才能达到真正团结全体农民、巩固合作社和发展农业生产的目的。
