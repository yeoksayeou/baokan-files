Why "Surrounded by a Garden of Flowers, Yet Unable to Smell the Fragrance"?
Capitalist Ideology Led Liu Jiemei Astray and Made Her Forget Her Roots

Liu Jiemei came from an extremely poor family, and only turned her life around after liberation under the leadership of the Communist Party. However, in order to satisfy her personal desires, she embarked on the capitalist path, maliciously attacked the Party's policies, and even said that her family's life had not improved after liberation...
What is the truth? The Huanggang County Cultural Center held an exhibition of her family's household items from generations past, powerfully refuting her fallacies and educating the broad masses of cadres and people.

(This report) Huanggang News Agency - Huanggang County Cultural Center, in coordination with the current socialist education campaign, held an exhibition of "Contrasts Between Past and Present" of material objects. Since its opening, it has attracted thousands of visitors every day. More than 1,000 cadres attending the Huanggang County Three-Level Cadre Conference have visited it, and students from Party schools, culture classes, government officials, teachers, students, and residents have all come to visit in groups. Some veteran comrades who have participated in the revolution for many years visited it and then brought their children born after liberation to visit.

The main exhibits were the clothes, utensils, and other furnishings of the family of Liu Jiemei, a rural cadre in Huanggang County, before and after liberation. On one side of the venue hung a mosquito net passed down from her grandmother who had begged for food. This mosquito net was passed down to her by her father, who also begged for food, and then to her, until she was given a good mosquito net during the land reform. It had been used for more than eighty years. It was patched with five or six layers of patches. Because this mosquito net was already dilapidated, it had to be tied to a bamboo pole with hemp rope when it was exhibited. There was also a cotton-padded jacket worn by four generations of the family. The lining and the outer fabric of this jacket had worn away. The remaining tufts of cotton were barely recognizable as a garment thanks to the crisscrossing hemp ropes that held them together. In addition to a three-legged wooden bed, there was also a wooden box without a bottom, which was placed upright and used as a cupboard. At the end of the twelfth lunar month in 1934, when her family was evicted by the landlord Gao Bisheng after their tenancy was seized, they used this wooden box as a table to celebrate the New Year with the food they had begged for. The other side displayed her family's current clothing and furnishings. The walls were covered with clothes of all colors. The cotton uniforms, sweaters, and sheepskin coats of her two brothers were also hung here. Her family now has nine people, nine cotton quilts, and more than 140 pieces of clothing. All sizes of leather shoes, Warrior brand sneakers, and rubber shoes filled the floor; replacing the broken wooden box was a large red lacquered wooden cabinet and two cypress tables. Charts on the wall showed that her family's income in 1948 was 48.6 yuan, and in 1956 it was 655.7 yuan; the grain consumed in 1948 was an average of 321 jin per person, and in 1956 it was 547 jin.

These exhibits attracted the audience because many people were not only familiar with Liu Jiemei's current situation but had also experienced the life that Liu Jiemei had experienced. These exhibits evoked everyone's memories, and at the same time, they guided everyone to think about a common question: What force has brought about such earth-shaking changes in the lives of farmers? One audience member wrote in the "Audience Comments" book: "Thinking about the past, my heart aches; looking at the present, I am truly happy. Following the Communist Party, even better days will come."

These silent exhibits aroused condemnation in the hearts of many people. Shu Changchun, the director of a cooperative in Chestnut Hill Township, stood in front of the exhibits, recalling his own experiences, and at the same time thinking about his past mistakes in overreporting grain rations and underreporting production during the unified purchase and sale, and cried to himself. Those who "are in a garden of flowers but cannot smell the fragrance" regained their sense of smell in front of the exhibits; those who were unclear about right and wrong on the issues of unified purchase and sale and collectivization were awakened here. The father of Sun Yanting, the director of the Tongli Cooperative in Cooperative Township, had worked as a hired hand all his life, and Sun Yanting himself was sent out to work at the age of six. Only after the land reform did he get a house and land. Unfortunately, his father died before he could see collectivization. This old man clearly saw that the Communist Party was the savior of the working people. On the night of his death, he called Sun Yanting to his bedside and told him about his life's hardships, and at dawn, he said to him: "I have been a hired hand all my life and have not left you anything. Your current life is all brought about by the Communist Party. Listen to the Party and never forget your roots." Then he died. Sun Yanting joined the cooperative, and his life became even better. However, due to the growth of capitalist ideology, he began to feel that the cooperative was "not free" and the unified purchase and sale was "not free". In the face of anti-socialist rhetoric, he secretly sympathized. The Party branch secretary of this township took him to visit this exhibition of material objects, and afterwards, he visited it twice on his own.

What kind of person is Liu Jiemei? Why use her family's material objects to carry out exhibitions among the masses? Why did this exhibition move the broad masses of visitors? Liu Jiemei came from a family of three generations of beggars and three generations of hired workers. Only after liberation did she turn her life around, get rid of poverty, join the Party, and become a cadre (currently the director of the Agricultural Technology Guidance Station in Macaomiao Township). It stands to reason that she should have deep-seated hatred for the old society and unparalleled love for the Communist Party and the new society. However, Liu Jiemei did not learn from the facts. Not long ago, she even attacked collectivization and the state's policy of unified purchase and sale, and blindly said that her own and the masses' lives had not improved. Why couldn't she see the facts and distinguish between right and wrong? It turned out that after her family turned over, her family life became prosperous. In 1953, she began to engage in usury (lending 200 yuan in Renminbi and six dan of grain). In three or four years, she became a "rich person" with 400 dan of grain. However, the collectivization and the state's policy of unified purchase and sale blocked the capitalist road she wanted to take. The matter is very clear. How can a person who is already standing on the capitalist stand distinguish between major issues of right and wrong?

At the Huanggang County Three-Level Cadre Conference, the Party and the comrades attending the meeting, with the spirit of curing diseases and saving people by presenting the facts and reasoning, finally refuted Liu Jiemei and made her realize her mistakes. This exhibition was also held to help Liu Jiemei recall and compare the past, after obtaining the consent of her and her family. Now Liu Jiemei has tearfully admitted her mistakes and expressed her determination to correct her mistakes and follow the Communist Party forever. This exhibition has also educated the broad masses of cadres and people.

This exhibition will also be exhibited in six larger market towns throughout the county.

### 为什么“身在百花园中却闻不到花香”？  资本主义思想使刘介梅迷路忘本

　　为什么“身在百花园中却闻不到花香”？
    资本主义思想使刘介梅迷路忘本
    刘介梅出身于极其贫困的家庭，解放后在共产党领导下才翻了身。但是他为了满足个人欲望，走上了资本主义的道路，并恶意攻击党的政策，还说解放后他家的生活并没有提高……
    真情到底如何？黄冈县文化馆以他家几代以来的家用实物举办了一个展览会，有力地驳倒了他的谬论，也教育了广大的干部和群众。
    本报讯　黄冈县文化馆配合当前社会主义教育举办了一个“今昔对比”实物展览会。开幕以来，每天都吸引着上千的参观者。参加黄冈县三级干部会的一千多名干部都来参观过，党校、文化班的学员、机关干部、学校的教师和学生以及居民都成群成群地赶来参观。一些参加革命多年的老同志参观以后，又带着他们的解放后出世的孩子来参观。
    展览会的主要展品是黄冈县农村干部刘介梅一家解放前后的衣服、用具和其他陈设。会场一边挂着一床由他的讨过饭的祖母传下来的蚊帐。这床蚊帐经过他的讨饭的父亲传给他，一直用到土地改革时分给他一床好蚊帐时止，计算起来，已经用过八十多年了。上面补补纳纳地订上了五、六层补钉。由于这床蚊帐已经破烂不堪，展出时，只得用麻绳把它系在竹竿上。还有一件穿过四代人的棉袄。这件棉袄的里子和面子都磨得不见了。剩下来的棉絮团子靠着纵横交错的麻绳的系绊，才勉强看得出是一件衣服。陈设中除了一张三只脚的木床以外，还有一个没有了底的木箱，竖了起来，当碗柜用。1934年腊月底，他家被地主高弼生夺了佃，被赶回来时，就是用这个木箱当桌子，摆上讨来的饭过的年。另一面则陈设着他家现在的衣着和陈设。墙壁上挂满了各色衣服。他兄弟二人的棉制服、毛衣和他的羊皮袄也都挂在这里。他家现在九口人，有九床棉絮和一百四十多件衣服，大大小小的皮鞋、回力鞋、胶鞋摆满了一地；代替破木箱的是一口大红漆木柜和两张柏木桌子。墙壁上的图表说明：他家1948年的收入是四十八元六角，1956年是六百五十五元七角；用的粮食，1948年每人平均三百二十一斤，1956年是五百四十七斤。
    这些展品吸引了观众，因为很多人不光是熟悉刘介梅的现在，而且也经历过刘介梅曾经经历过的生活。这些展品勾起了每一个人的回忆，同时又引导大家想到一个共同的问题：是什么力量使农民的生活发生这样天翻地覆的变化？一个观众在“观众留言”簿上写道：“想过去，心欲碎；看现在，实开怀。跟着共产党，更美的日子就会来。”
    这些无言的展品，引起了许多人内心的谴责。栗树岗乡一社主任舒长春站在展品前面，回想了自己的经历，同时想到过去在统购统销中，多报口粮，少报产量的错误，暗自哭了一场。“身在百花园里却闻不到花香”的人，在展品面前，唤回了嗅觉；在统购统销和合作化问题上不明是非的人，在这里清醒了。合作乡同力社主任孙炎廷的父亲打了一辈子长工，孙炎廷自己在六岁时就被送出去卖工。土改后才分得了房子和土地，可惜，他的父亲没有看到合作化便死去了。这位老人，明白地看出共产党才是劳动人民的救星。在临死的夜晚，把孙炎廷叫到床前，对他诉说了自己一辈子的苦楚，到天亮时，才对他说：“我打了一生长工，没有给你留下什么东西，你现在的生活都是共产党带来的，要听党的话，切莫忘了本。”然后死去了。孙炎廷加入了合作社，生活也更加好起来。但是由于滋长了资本主义思想，他开始觉得合作社“不自由”，统购统销“不自由”了。在反对社会主义的言论面前，他暗暗地抱同情。这个乡的支部书记带他去参观了这个实物展览，以后，他又独自去参观了两次。
    刘介梅究竟是怎样的一个人呢？为什么要用他家的实物在群众中进行展览？为什么这次展览会感动了广大的参观者？刘介梅出身于三代讨饭、三代当雇工的家庭，解放后才翻了身，摆脱了贫困，入了党，当了干部（现任马曹庙乡农业技术指导站站长）。照理说，他应当对旧社会有刻骨的仇恨，对共产党和新社会有无比的热爱。但是，刘介梅却并没有从事实中得到教训，不久以前，他竟然攻击合作化和国家的统购统销政策，还闭着眼睛说什么自己和群众的生活并没有提高。为什么他看不见事实，分不清是非呢？原来他家在翻身以后，家庭生活富裕了，1953年开始放高利贷（放了二百元人民币，六石谷子），三、四年时间他就成为有四百担谷子的“富人”了。但是合作化和国家的统购统销政策堵塞了他所要走的资本主义道路。事情很明显，已经站在资本主义立场上的人，怎么能够分清大是大非呢？
    在黄冈县的三级干部大会上，党和参加会议的同志，以摆事实、说道理的治病救人精神，终于驳倒了刘介梅，使他觉悟过来。这个展览会也是为了帮助刘介梅回忆对比，在取得了他和他家里的人的同意以后举办的。现在刘介梅已经痛哭流涕地承认了自己的错误，表示要痛改前非，永远跟着共产党走。这个展览会同时也教育了广大的干部和群众。
    这个展览会还将在全县六个较大的集镇上巡回展出。
