    Comrade Zdeněk Fierlinger, Chairman of the National Assembly of Czechoslovakia,
    Comrade Zdeněk Fierlinger, a prominent Czechoslovak statesman, who is leading the delegation of the National Assembly of Czechoslovakia on a visit to our country at the invitation of Chairman Liu Shaoqi.
    Comrade Fierlinger was born in Olomouc on July 11, 1891. After graduating from business school, he went to Russia. During the First World War, Comrade Fierlinger participated in the struggle against the Austro-Hungarian feudal empire abroad. During the great revolutionary transformation, he supported the Russian proletarian revolution. After the First World War, Comrade Fierlinger entered the diplomatic circles of the then Czechoslovak Republic. Throughout his service in the diplomatic field, Comrade Fierlinger insisted on close cooperation with the Soviet Union. When Czechoslovakia faced the threat of German fascism, he resolutely advocated a thorough struggle and the establishment of a united anti-fascist front of Czechs and Slovaks. During the German occupation of Czechoslovakia and the outbreak of the Second World War, Comrade Fierlinger engaged in anti-fascist work abroad and actively strived to unite the working class on the basis of Marxism-Leninism.
    Comrade Fierlinger served as the Czechoslovak ambassador to the Soviet Union twice, from 1937 to 1939 and from 1941 to 1945, and did much to strengthen the friendship between the people of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. He helped establish the Czechoslovak Legion in the Soviet Union and prepared and signed the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Cooperation between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.
    From April 1945 to July 1946, Comrade Fierlinger served as the first Prime Minister of the Czechoslovak coalition government after liberation, and as Deputy Prime Minister after the 1946 general election. In February 1948, Comrade Fierlinger, together with Comrade Gottwald and other comrades, crushed the bourgeois conspiracy to launch a coup and established a new people's democratic government on a broad basis of the National Front. He did a lot of preparatory work for the merger of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party into the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in 1948. Before the merger of the two parties, Comrade Fierlinger was the chairman of the Social Democratic Party. From the February 1948 events until 1953, he served as Deputy Prime Minister of the government. In September 1953, he was elected Chairman of the National Assembly. In 1954, he was elected a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia at the 10th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party.
    Comrade Fierlinger has done a lot of work in strengthening the friendship between the people of China and Czechoslovakia. He once said: "The Chinese people and the Czechoslovak people have a common goal - to safeguard peace, build their own country and ensure a happy life for the working people. The people of the two countries are cooperating closely and friendly in order to achieve these lofty goals."
