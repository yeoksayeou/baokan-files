Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 4th: Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a summary report at the closing session of the Second Shanghai Municipal People's Congress.

    In his report, Ke Qingshi said that the conference was very successful. Through this great debate, the crimes of the rightists in opposing the Communist Party and socialism have been fully exposed, and their reactionary remarks have been refuted thoroughly. After actively participating in the struggle, the representatives have also received a profound class education. Now, the rightist front in Shanghai has been defeated. Although some rightists are still quibbling, this only further exposes their ugly faces. The anti-rightist struggle in Shanghai is at a stage of in-depth development. We must maintain a strong fighting spirit, and as long as rightists exist, our anti-rightist struggle will never stop.

    Ke Qingshi then elaborated in detail on why a socialist revolution is still needed in politics and ideology after the decisive victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front. He said that the socialist revolution is different from any previous revolution in any era. It is a revolutionary transformation that fundamentally changes ownership and eliminates the system of exploitation. This revolution is unfamiliar to many people. People who grew up in the old society, except for the working class, have developed an individualistic and selfish ideology, caring only about themselves and not others. These people's ideological habits are obviously in contradiction to varying degrees with our desire to eliminate classes and organize collectivist ideas of public labor. To thoroughly eliminate the various reactionary toxins left by the reactionary rulers in people's minds, a relatively long-term struggle is still needed. After the three major transformations, how bourgeois elements, small producers, and well-to-do middle peasants can completely change their capitalist stance in the process of further accepting socialist transformation is still a very arduous task. Among the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals, there are still a small number of people who are unwilling to accept the failure of reactionary rule, and who are not convinced by the workers and peasants, or the leadership of the Communist Party. The rightists among them once launched a frenzied attack on the Communist Party, and as a result, suffered a disastrous defeat. However, they will still wait for an opportunity to act, which cannot be completely resolved by one anti-rightist struggle.

    Ke Qingshi pointed out that this political and ideological socialist revolution is a new form of class struggle in the current era. This revolution is particularly profound because, on the one hand, we must resolutely oppose the restoration conspiracies of imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek, and the rightists, and on the other hand, we must transform people's individualism into collectivism, and gradually establish socialist new systems, new work methods, and new moral concepts deeply rooted in people's minds, cultivating everyone's infinite loyalty and extremely strong revolutionary will for the cause of socialism.

    Ke Qingshi then talked about why the method of correctly handling contradictions among the people can only persuade and not coerce. He said that the famous formula for resolving contradictions among the people put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao: unity—criticism—unity, is implemented by presenting facts, reasoning, and conducting great debates. The existence of contradictions is not only a reflection of thought, but also an objective existence of things themselves. Therefore, to resolve contradictions, it is only possible to present facts and reason. Ke Qingshi said that truth is not afraid of debate. In the past, during the period of reactionary rule, the rulers reversed right and wrong and deceived the people, making it impossible to distinguish right from wrong in society. Today, the people have seized power and can not only clarify right and wrong, but the masses have also improved their class consciousness through various political movements, and everyone has the ability to distinguish right from wrong. Truth has been grasped by the masses, and truth has become an irresistible force. Therefore, it is entirely possible to use the method of persuasion instead of coercion to resolve contradictions among the people. Presenting facts and reasoning is not only a way to resolve contradictions among the people, experience has proved that this method is also a powerful weapon to combat rightists.

    Ke Qingshi said that this method of presenting facts and reasoning is a pragmatic and mass line approach. Doing so can avoid arbitrariness and one-sidedness, and can most effectively educate many wavering and unstable elements, enabling them to recognize major rights and wrongs and embark on the correct path. This method is also of great benefit to ourselves, as debate can enable us to further consider issues, and exercise and improve ourselves.

    In the last part of his report, Ke Qingshi talked about the important significance of ideological remolding of intellectuals. He said that from a historical perspective, no society or era has valued knowledge and intellectuals as much as the working people who are in charge today. In our socialist country, intellectuals are regarded as the wealth of the country; and only in today's era of the people can intellectuals play the greatest role. He said that after many years of revolutionary struggle, some intellectuals have already combined with workers and peasants, and have become intellectuals of the workers and peasants themselves. However, we also see that when rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Communist Party, the remarks of the rightists easily resonated with some intellectuals, which shows that the self-remolding of intellectuals is very important.

    Ke Qingshi said that from the perspective of social development, knowledge comes from labor, and is also needed by the working people. Class society separates knowledge from the working people, causing intellectuals to develop a set of conceited ideas. In fact, mastering knowledge is nothing great. Workers and peasants have accumulated rich production knowledge in their labor. As long as they have the opportunity to study culture, after three, five, ten, or twenty years, they can also master advanced scientific and cultural knowledge.

    Ke Qingshi said that intellectuals consider themselves lofty, but in fact, they must rely on something to play their role. Because they can neither farm nor work, even Tao Yuanming, who would not bow for five pecks of rice, had to rely on farmers to support him. In the old society, intellectuals relied on landlords and the bourgeoisie. Today, intellectuals must serve the workers and peasants to play their role. It is the most lofty for intellectuals to serve the workers and peasants who do not exploit others wholeheartedly.

    He also said that the vast majority of old intellectuals come from landlord and bourgeois families. They received feudal and bourgeois education, and served the reactionary ruling class for a long time. There is a strong exploitative class ideology in the depths of their minds. If they are not remolded, they cannot exert the role of their knowledge.

    He said that the characteristic of intellectuals' work is individual labor. For example, a writer publishes a book, and a scientist has a creative invention, which are all reflected through individuals. In fact, these labor achievements are developed on the basis of countless labor of predecessors. However, intellectuals often only see their own achievements, and therefore are prone to growing individualism and the concept of fame and position, ignoring the achievements of the working people, and being ungrateful. This is the most worthy of intellectuals' vigilance.

    Ke Qingshi also pointed out that intellectuals also have many strengths. Such as their love for their careers, their love for the country, and a certain sensitivity to distinguishing right from wrong. This shows that intellectuals need to be remolded and can be remolded well.

    Ke Qingshi finally said that there are not too many intellectuals today, but too few. Our expectations for intellectuals are earnest. We hope that all intellectuals will integrate with workers and peasants, and gradually transform themselves into intellectuals of the workers and peasants. We have every reason to believe that all intellectuals who love the motherland, love scientific and cultural undertakings, and love the truth will certainly not let down the people's high expectations for them.

    柯庆施同志总结上海人代会上的反右派斗争
    辨明大是大非  锻炼大智大勇
    摆事实讲道理是教育群众、打击右派的有效办法
    新华社上海4日电　中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施，在3日闭幕的上海市第二届人民代表大会第二次会议上作了总结报告。
    柯庆施在报告中说，这次会议开得很好，经过这场大辩论，右派分子的反共、反社会主义罪行已被充分地揭露出来，他们的反动言论已被驳得体无完肤。代表们在积极参加斗争以后，同样也使自己受了一次深刻的阶级教育。现在，上海右派阵线已被打垮了，尽管还有若干右派分子仍在狡赖，这只是更进一步暴露了他们自己的丑恶面目。上海反右派斗争正处在深入开展阶段，我们要保持旺盛的斗志，只要右派分子存在一天，我们的反右派斗争就决不停止。
    柯庆施接着详细阐述了社会主义革命在经济战线上取得了决定性胜利以后，为什么还需要在政治上、思想上进行社会主义革命的道理。他说，社会主义革命和以往任何时代的革命都不同，是要从根本上改变所有制、消灭剥削制度的翻天覆地的革命。这种革命对许多人来说，是不习惯的。在旧社会里生长的人，除工人阶级以外，都养成了一种个人主义自私自利思想，只关心自己不顾别人。这些人的思想习惯，显然同我们要消灭阶级、组织公共劳动的集体主义思想，是存在着不同程度的矛盾的。要彻底肃清反动统治者遗留在人们思想上的各种反动毒素，还需要进行较长期的斗争。经过三大改造以后，资产阶级分子、小生产者、富裕中农在进一步接受社会主义改造过程中如何彻底改变资本主义立场，还是一件很艰巨的工作。在资产阶级和资产阶级知识分子中，还有小部分人不甘心反动统治的失败，对工人、农民不服气，对共产党的领导不服气。他们当中的右派分子这次曾经对共产党进行了猖狂进攻，结果遭到惨败，但他们还会待机而动，不是一次反右派斗争所能完全解决的。
    柯庆施指出，这种政治上、思想上的社会主义革命是当前阶级斗争的一种新形式。这种革命之所以特别深刻，是因为，一方面要坚决反对帝国主义、蒋介石、右派分子的复辟阴谋，另一方面又要把人们的个人主义变为集体主义，把社会主义这一套新的制度，新的工作方法，新的道德观念等等，在人们的脑海中逐渐根深蒂固地树立起来，培养每个人对于社会主义事业的无限忠诚和无比坚强的革命意志。
    柯庆施接着谈到正确处理人民内部矛盾的方法为什么只能说服不能压服。他说，党中央、毛主席提出的解决人民内部矛盾的著名公式：团结——批评——团结，就是用摆事实、讲道理，进行大辩论来贯彻的。矛盾的存在不仅是思想的反应，而且也是事物本身的客观存在，因此，解决矛盾只有摆事实、讲道理。柯庆施说，真理是不怕辩论的。过去在反动统治时期，统治者颠倒是非，蒙蔽人民，使社会上的是非无法分别。今天人民掌握政权不但可以讲清是非，而且群众通过各种政治运动提高了阶级觉悟，大家都有了辨别是非的能力。真理已为群众所掌握，真理就成为不可抗拒的力量。所以采用说服而不是压服的办法来解决人民内部矛盾，是完全可能的。摆事实、讲道理不仅是解决人民内部矛盾的办法，经验证明，这个办法同样也是打击右派有力的武器。
    柯庆施说，这种摆事实、讲道理的办法是实事求是的也是走群众路线的办法。这样做可以避免武断、片面，能够最有效地教育不少动摇不稳定的分子，使他们认清大是大非走上正确的道路。这种办法对我们自己也有很大的好处，通过辩论可以使我们进一步去考虑问题，锻炼和提高自己。
    柯庆施在报告的最后一部分谈到知识分子思想改造的重要意义。他说，从历史上看，任何社会任何时代，都没有今天当家作主的劳动人民这样重视知识和知识分子，在我们社会主义国家里，知识分子被当作国家的财富；而知识分子也只有在今天人民的时代才能发挥最大的作用。他说，经过多少年来的革命斗争，使得知识分子中的一部分人已经和工农结合，成为工农自己的知识分子。但是，我们也看到，当右派分子向共产党猖狂进攻时，右派分子的言论很容易在某些知识分子中引起共鸣，这说明知识分子的自我改造是十分重要的。
    柯庆施说，从社会发展来看，知识是从劳动中来的，也是劳动人民所需要的。阶级社会把知识和劳动人民分开，使知识分子养成一套自高自大的思想。其实，掌握知识并没有什么了不起。工人农民在劳动中积累了丰富的生产知识，他们只要有学习文化的机会，经过三年五年十年二十年，同样也能掌握先进的科学文化知识。
    柯庆施说，知识分子自命清高，事实上他们要发挥自己的作用，必须有所依附。因为他们既不能种田，又不能作工，连不为五斗米折腰的陶渊明，也要依靠农民养活。在旧社会里，知识分子依附地主资产阶级。今天知识分子要发挥自己的作用，必须为工农劳动人民服务。知识分子全心全意为不剥削别人的工人农民服务，才是最清高的。
    他又说，绝大部分旧知识分子出身于地主、资产阶级家庭，他们受的是封建、资产阶级的教育，并长期为反动统治阶级服务。在他们思想深处有浓厚的剥削阶级思想意识，如果不改造就不能发挥他们的知识的作用。
    他说，知识分子的工作特点是个体劳动，如作家出了一本书，科学家有了一项创造发明，都是通过个人体现出来。其实这些劳动成果都是在前人无数劳动的基础上发展起来的。但是知识分子往往只看到自己的成就，因而容易滋长个人主义和名位观念，漠视劳动人民的成果，忘恩负义。这点最值得知识分子警惕。
    柯庆施同时也指出，知识分子也有许多长处。如他们对事业的爱好，对国家的热爱，对辨别是非有一定的敏感。这说明知识分子是需要改造而且是可以改造好的。
    柯庆施最后说，今天知识分子不是太多了而是少了。我们对知识分子的期望是殷切的。我们希望所有的知识分子和工农打成一片，逐渐将自己改造成为工农的知识分子。我们完全有理由相信，一切热爱祖国、热爱科学文化事业、热爱真理的知识分子，一定不会辜负人民对他们的厚望。
