Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 25th: The South Korean "Chosun Ilbo" reported that the US military authorities in South Korea are once again forcing 300 farming families residing in Paju County, Gyeonggi Province, to move.

After US military police looted a village in Paju County in April of this year, the US military authorities, in order to cover up this atrocity, falsely accused more than 600 residents of this county of being "hooligans" and drove them away.

    南朝鲜美军强迫农民搬家
    据新华社平壤25日电　南朝鲜的“朝鲜日报”报道，南朝鲜美军当局再次强迫住在京畿道坡州郡的三百家农民搬家。
    美军宪兵在今年4月洗劫了坡州郡的一个村庄以后，美军当局为了掩饰这一暴行，曾经诬蔑这个郡的六百多居民是“无赖”，并且把他们赶走。
