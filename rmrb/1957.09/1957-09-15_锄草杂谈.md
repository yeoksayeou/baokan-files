　　Casual Talks on Weeding
　　"Telescope" and "Microscope"
    Rightist Wang Zaoshi said: We should use a telescope to view our work achievements and a microscope to examine the shortcomings in our work. Wonderful, a "gentleman's" argument.
    A telescope is a tool used to look "far" and compensate for insufficient eyesight. The significant achievements of the Party's leadership over the past eight years have surpassed the entire past century, and these achievements permeate every aspect of our lives. Taking Shanghai as an example, the paradise of adventurers in the past has now become a city of the working people. Urban construction is changing with each passing day, and the achievements are right in front of us, visible to all seven million citizens. However, the Rightists insist on using a telescope to observe, and as a result, they can only see outer space, and no achievements exist at all.
    As for the microscope, its role is to enlarge small and local things. The shortcomings in our work are originally local, small and secondary compared to the achievements, but once placed under a microscope, they become gigantic, and the Rightists then shout "pitch black" and "utter darkness."
    This is how the Rightists obliterate our achievements and exaggerate our shortcomings. ·Qi Zhen·
　　Talking about "Slave Owners" and "Slaves"
    Every member of the revolutionary ranks has a glorious title: "Servant of the People." In this revolutionary team that serves the people, there is only a distinction of labor and a distinction between leadership and being led, but regardless of their position, they are all servants of the people. As citizens of the People's Republic of China, they are all equal in rights and obligations.
    However, the Rightists viciously scold and slander Party leading cadres as "slave owners" and general cadres as "slaves," attempting to provoke the relationship between leaders and those being led, oppose Party members holding leadership positions, and even oppose the leadership of the entire Party.
    "Slave owners" and "slaves" are the relationship between rulers and the ruled, which is completely different from the relationship between leaders and those being led in today's revolutionary ranks.
    Rightists, stop dreaming of "igniting" a fire from this issue! In the people's revolutionary ranks, there will never be "slave owners" and "slaves."
                  ·Zheng Leyi·
　　Two-Faced People Only Have One Face
    In our country, openly proposing the slogan "Down with the Communist Party" is reactionary. The Rightists certainly cannot fail to see this situation. So they resort to two-faced tactics.
    Although two-faced people have two faces, they actually only have one. The bright face is to cover up the dark face, one is false and the other is real. It is by no means a case of two and a half making five, half supporting the Communist Party and half opposing it. The hateful thing about two-faced people is that they often show the bright, false face in public, while the dark, real face is hidden very cleverly. Therefore, some kind-hearted and honest people are easily fooled by them, believing that they only have opinions on a certain socialist system, a certain socialist policy, or a certain Communist Party organization, and do not want to overthrow the Communist Party, and even if they express opinions, they do not forget to say that they want to implement the Party's policies and carry out the Party's line.
    Precisely because of this, the struggle against the Rightists must be a difficult ideological struggle, requiring calm analysis and layer-by-layer exposure. We cannot be impatient and act rashly, rushing in and then dispersing. We must persevere until the Rightists have nowhere to hide and their true colors are revealed. Only when all honest people are awakened and no longer fooled by the Rightists will we be victorious and can end the struggle.

　　锄草杂谈
　　“望远镜”与“显微镜”
    右派分子王造时说：我们要一手拿望远镜来观看工作成绩，一手拿显微镜来检查工作中的缺点。妙哉，“君子”之论也。
    夫望远镜者，用以望“远”而补目力不足之工具也。八年来党所领导的各项事业的重大成绩，超越了过去整个世纪，这些成绩渗透在我们生活的各个方面。仅以上海而论，昔日冒险家的乐园，今已变成劳动人民的城市。市政建设日新月异，成绩近在咫尺，七百万市民人人得见。而右派分子独要用望远镜去观察，结果就只能看见一片太空，什么成绩都不存在了。
    至于显微镜，其作用在于把微小的、局部的事物扩而大之。我们工作中的缺点本来是局部的，与成绩比较起来是微小的和次要的，但一旦放在显微镜下，就变成庞然大物，于是右派就大喊“漆黑一片”、“暗无天日”了。
    右派分子就是这样抹煞我们的成绩和夸大缺点的。·企真·
　　谈“奴隶主”与“奴隶”
    革命队伍里的每一个成员，都有一个光荣的称号：“人民的勤务员”。在这支为人民服务的革命队伍里，只有分工的区别和领导与被领导的区别，但是无论职位的高低，都同样是人民的勤务员，作为中华人民共和国的公民，他们在权利和义务上是一律平等的。
    但是右派分子恶毒地谩骂和污蔑党员领导干部像“奴隶主”，一般干部像“奴隶”，想挑拨领导与被领导的关系，反对党员担任领导职务，以至反对整个党的领导。
    “奴隶主”与“奴隶”是统治者与被统治者的关系，这与今天革命队伍中领导与被领导的关系毫无相同之处。
    右派分子别梦想从这个问题上来“点火”吧！在人民的革命队伍里，是永远没有“奴隶主”与“奴隶”的。
                  ·郑乐毅·
　　两面派只有一面
    在我们的国家里面，公开提出“打倒共产党”这个口号就是反动的了。右派分子当然不会看不到这种形势。于是就使出两面派的手段来了。
    两面派虽然两面，其实只有一面，明的一面是为了掩护暗的一面，一虚一实，决不是二一添作五，一半拥护共产党，一半反对共产党的。两面派的可恨也就在这里，他们经常在公开场合表现了明的虚的一面，而暗的实的一面却掩藏得非常巧妙。因此，有一些好心肠的老实人，就容易为他们所愚弄，认为他们只不过对某一项社会主义制度、某一项社会主义政策、某一个共产党组织有意见，并没有要打倒共产党，而且即使提出意见，也没有忘记说要贯彻党的方针，执行党的路线呀。
    正因为如此，反对右派分子的斗争，就不能不是一个艰难的思想斗争，需要冷静分析，一层一层揭破，不能急躁从事，一轰而起又一轰而散。必须坚持不懈，直至最后打得右派分子无处藏身，原形毕露。老实人全都觉悟，不受右派分子愚弄，才是胜利，才可结束。
