Comrade János Kádár, Prime Minister of Hungary CCP Central Committee's Directive on Agricultural Cooperative Cadres' Mandatory Participation in Production Labor
(September 25, 1957)

The Central Committee has repeatedly instructed that cadres of agricultural cooperatives, from directors and deputy directors, must participate in production labor. Many cooperatives have already resolved this issue well, but many others have not resolved it satisfactorily, or even delayed it. The Central Committee believes that during the rectification campaign, Party committees at all levels in all localities must examine the actual implementation of the Central Committee's instructions in each cooperative, and guide each cooperative to formulate appropriate solutions to this problem through mass discussions, based on their own conditions. When discussing and formulating such measures, the following provisions may be referred to:

	(1) Cooperative cadres should adopt a rotating shift system, or a daily shift system, or a morning and afternoon shift system for handling routine affairs. Outside of shift duty or meetings, cadres should participate in production labor like ordinary members.

	(2) The labor of cadres, like that of ordinary members, should be compensated with work points according to the quantity and quality of labor. Therefore, the living expenses of cadres should not be entirely subsidized by the cooperative, but only those parts lost due to official duties. Subsidies can also take the form of fixed quotas, but because most cadres can participate in production labor for most of the time after implementing shift duty, the general subsidy quota should not be too high. Because accountants have regular technical work, the amount of subsidy should be determined separately.

	(3) Under the condition of implementing the previous two provisions, the total number of work points subsidized for cooperative cadres' participation in cooperative affairs should generally strive not to exceed 1% of the total work points of the entire cooperative.

In order to ensure that the above provisions can be implemented more smoothly, Party committees at the county, district, and township levels should improve their leadership methods and reduce unnecessary meetings in accordance with the Central Committee's notice on several matters concerning democratic cooperative management.

    匈牙利总理卡达尔同志中共中央关于农业合作社干部必须参加生产劳动的指示
    （一九五七年九月二十五日）
    中央多次指示，农业合作社的干部，从主任副主任起，都必须参加生产劳动。许多合作社已经很好地解决了这个问题，但是，也有不少合作社还解决得不很妥善，甚至迟迟未决。中央认为：在整风运动中，各地各级党委都必须检查各合作社执行中央指示的实际情况，指导各合作社按照自己的条件，通过群众讨论，适当地拟出解决这个问题的办法。在讨论和拟定这类办法的时候，可以参考下列规定：
    （1）合作社干部处理日常事务的工作，采取轮流值班制，或者分日值班，或者分上下午值班。在值班或者开会以外的时间，干部都同一般社员一样参加生产劳动。
    （2）干部的劳动，同一般社员一样，按劳动的数量和质量，领取工分。因此，干部的生活费用，不要完全由社补贴，而可以只由社补贴那些因公误工的部分。补贴也可以采取定额的办法，但因为多数干部在实行值班办事以后，大部分时间可以参加生产劳动，一般的补贴定额都不宜太高。会计因为有经常的技术性的业务，补贴数量应该另定。
    （3）在实施前两项规定的条件下，合作社干部参加社务工作的补贴工分总数，一般地应该力求不至超过全社工分总数的1％。
    为了保证以上的规定能够更顺利地实施，县、区、乡各级党委应该按照中央关于民主办社几个事项的通知，改进领导方法，减少一些不必要的会议。
