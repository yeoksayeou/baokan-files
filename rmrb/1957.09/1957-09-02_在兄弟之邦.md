In Fraternal Countries

    Savings Wind Popular in Poland
    The trend of saving is becoming more and more popular in Poland. From January to July of this year, deposits in the National Savings Office amounted to 1.735 billion zlotys. This figure is equal to the total amount of deposits in Poland during the three years from 1954 to 1956. According to statistics, as of July 31 this year, the total amount of deposits in the National Savings Office is nearly 4.7 billion zlotys.
    The number of depositors has also increased significantly. About 442,000 new savings accounts were opened in the first half of this year. According to statistics at the end of July this year, a total of 5.5 million people in Poland participated in savings.

    Hungarian News and Publishing Undertakings Recover Vigor
    In the one or two months after the October events, only the Party newspaper and the trade union newspaper were available nationwide. In recent months, the news teams have been reorganized, and the editorial departments of various newspapers and periodicals have also been reorganized. Now the news and publishing undertakings have gradually returned to their previous scale. For example, "Evening News", "State News", "Hungarian News", "Little Comrades News", monthly magazine "Social Observation", weekly magazine "Hungarian Youth", "Women", "Goose Herding Boy", "People's Sports" and other publications have been successively re-published.
    The organ of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, "People's Freedom Daily," has been increasing its circulation month by month since its re-publication on November 4 last year. When it was re-published, it had a daily circulation of 30,000 copies, which increased to 250,000 copies in February, and now has a daily circulation of 573,000 copies. The organ of the Free Trade Union Federation, "People's Will Daily," now has a daily circulation of 210,000 copies.

    波兰人民储蓄风气盛行
    储蓄的风尚在波兰一天天盛行。今年1月到7月存入国家储蓄处的款项为十七亿三千五百万兹罗提。这个数字等于波兰1954—1956年三年间存款数的总和。据统计，到今年7月31日为止，在国家储蓄处的存款总数将近四十七亿兹罗提。

    匈牙利社会主义工人党的机关报“人民自由报”，自去年11月4日复刊以来发行份数在逐月增加，复刊时每天发行三万份，2月份增加到二十五万份，现在每天发行五十七万三千份。自由工会联合会机关报“人民意志报”现在每天发行二十一万份。
