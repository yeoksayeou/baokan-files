Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd -- Soviet newspapers have recently published a number of materials exposing the truth about the so-called affluent life and the so-called "People's Capitalism" in the United States. An article in the "Soviet Russia" newspaper on August 28th, concerning the myth and reality of "People's Capitalism," used many accurate statistics to illustrate that American society is one of wide disparity between rich and poor, and full of contradictions.

The article pointed out that the capitalist defenders in the United States are shouting about so-called "universal prosperity" in the United States, but what is the actual situation? According to official materials, capitalist monopoly groups gained a net profit of 26.2 billion US dollars in 1949, 42.7 billion US dollars in 1955, and 43.4 billion US dollars in 1956. All these profits rolled into the pockets of the capitalists. The Ford Motor Company alone makes a profit of $1.2 million every day. Gold nourishes the big capitalists like rain.

As for the American working class, not only have they not become capitalists, but they are becoming increasingly proletarianized. According to a statistic by an American scholar, 98% of workers do not own any stock. The number of employed laborers in the United States is increasing every year. Last year, the United States promulgated a law stipulating that the minimum wage standard is one dollar per hour, but in reality, there are now 20 million workers and employees whose hourly wage is less than one dollar. Many Americans have to live on debt. At the beginning of this year, the total debt owed by American residents for purchasing goods reached 162 billion US dollars.

The article went on to say that the American capitalists' pursuit of profits has resulted in extremely harsh working conditions for workers. Industrial accidents in the United States are constantly increasing. According to materials from an American trade union magazine, an accident occurs on average every sixteen seconds in American production, and a worker dies every four minutes. Approximately two million workers in the United States are disabled or seriously injured each year. American companies stipulate that workers over the age of forty-five are to be dismissed.

The ever-increasing wave of strikes in the United States further shatters the lie of so-called "People's Capitalism." In the five years before the war (1936-1940), the United States averaged 2,961 strikes per year; after the war, from 1946 to 1950, the average was 4,109 strikes per year; and from 1951 to 1955, the average was 4,546 strikes per year. In the first half of this year, there have already been 2,075 strikes in the United States. In the United States, strikes are virtually prohibited due to the Taft-Hartley Anti-Labor Act, but strikes still occur frequently, which is enough to expose the lies of so-called "People's Capitalism" and the extinction of class struggle in the United States.

### 所谓“人民资本主义”纯属鬼话  美国社会贫富悬殊阶级矛盾激化  苏联报刊揭穿美国的谎言

    所谓“人民资本主义”纯属鬼话
    美国社会贫富悬殊阶级矛盾激化
    苏联报刊揭穿美国的谎言
    新华社莫斯科3日电　苏联报刊最近陆续发表了许多材料，揭露美国所谓生活富裕以及所谓“人民资本主义”的真相。“苏维埃俄罗斯报”8月28日登载的一篇关于“人民资本主义”的神话和现实的文章，用许多确切的统计材料说明美国的社会是一个贫富悬殊、矛盾百出的社会。
    文章指出，美国的资本主义卫士们叫嚷在美国有所谓“普遍繁荣”，而实际情况是怎样呢？根据官方材料，资本家垄断集团1949年获得了纯利二百六十二亿美元，1955年是四百二十七亿美元，1956年是四百三十四亿美元。这些利润都滚进了资本家的口袋里。仅仅美国福特公司每天就获利一百二十万美元。黄金像雨一样滋润着大资本家们。
    至于美国的工人阶级，他们不但没有变成什么资本家，而是日益无产阶级化了。据美国一位学者统计，有98％的工人并没有甚么股票。美国雇佣劳动的数目每年都在增加。去年美国曾经公布法律，规定最低工资标准是每小时一美元，但是实际上现在有两千万工人和职员每小时工资不到一美元。许多美国人不得不靠借债生活。今年年初美国居民购买物品欠债总额已经达到一千六百二十亿美元。
    文章接着说，美国资本家们追求利润的结果，使得工人们劳动条件非常恶劣。美国工业中发生的工伤事故不断上升。据美国一家工会杂志的材料，美国生产中平均每隔十六秒钟就发生一次不幸事故，每四分钟就有一个工人死亡。美国每年有约二百万工人成为残废或受重伤。美国企业规定凡是超过四十五岁的工人就被解雇。
    美国的罢工浪潮不断增涨的事实更粉碎了所谓“人民资本主义”的谎言。美国在战前五年（1936—1940）平均每年发生罢工二千九百六十一次；战后1946—1950年平均每年四千一百零九次；1951—1955年平均每年发生罢工四千五百四十六次。今年上半年美国已经发生罢工二千零七十五次。在美国，由于有塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法，罢工实际上是被禁止的，但是罢工的情况仍然频频发生，这就足以揭穿美国所谓“人民资本主义”和阶级斗争熄灭的谎言。
