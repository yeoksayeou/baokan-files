The development of the Egyptian Film Industry
Jīn Shēng

    Before 1955, Egypt was the only country in Africa and the Arab world capable of producing films. Therefore, in the past, progressive Egyptian films were the only ones that could correctly reflect the thoughts of the African and Arab people and portray their customs, habits, and religious beliefs. These excellent Egyptian films were not only deeply loved by the people of Africa and Arab countries but also showcased the talent of the Egyptian people, who have a long tradition of culture and art, to film audiences around the world. They also provided a powerful response to the reactionary films produced by Western countries, particularly Hollywood film merchants, which were specifically designed to mock, distort, and harm the Arab people and promote colonialism.
    Egyptian cinema is relatively young. It was only in 1927 that the first Egyptian feature film, "Zainab," was produced. This was a tragic film depicting how an innocent young girl's life was destroyed under the oppression of feudal traditions and old etiquette. When the film was released to the public in April 1928, it left a deep impression on the Egyptian people. The early years of the birth of Egyptian national cinema saw slow development. It wasn't until 1934, when Togo Mizrachi established the first photography studio in Bakos, that the foundation for the Egyptian film industry was officially laid. In 1935, studios were established successively in Cairo and Giza, and films began to be produced in large numbers. By the start of World War II, more than forty sound films had been produced. Among them, "Wedad," produced by the "Misr Studio" in Giza in 1936, was relatively successful. This was a love story depicting the joys and sorrows of a young couple. At the same time, some films exposing the feudal social system of the time were also produced.
    After the outbreak of World War II, with the development of the Egyptian film industry, many speculators entered the film industry and produced many low-quality films that catered to the low tastes of the audience. By the time of the Egyptian revolution in 1952, most of the Egyptian films screened on the Egyptian film market were historical films, song and dance films, and social films. Of course, the strangulation by the Farouk censorship authorities of films with progressive tendencies was also one of the reasons that forced some artists to escape reality and turn to mythological, legendary, and song-and-dance themes.
    In July 1952, under the leadership of President Nasser, the Egyptian people overthrew the rule of the Farouk feudal dynasty and established the Republic. Since then, the Egyptian film industry has had favorable conditions for development. Soon after the establishment of the Republic, the Egyptian National Guidance Committee made the following proposal to the film industry: "We want to have clever stories from which the audience can learn something. All new films should have cultural value, social significance, and documentary value. ... We believe that it is very necessary to use film to educate the masses." The Republic government also made major improvements to the film censorship and other systems. These new measures deeply inspired Egyptian filmmakers. Judging from the films produced in Egypt since 1952, there has been a significant increase in films with realistic modern themes in terms of content. These films have expressed the wishes of the Egyptian people in many ways, as well as the various sufferings they endured during the Farouk regime. The active support of the Egyptian Republic government for its domestic films is also reflected in the more rapid development of Egyptian film enterprises than in the past. At present, Egypt has eighty-six film companies and seven film studios, of which the Pyramid and Egypt film studios are not only equipped with new equipment, but are also quite large in scale. These studios produce an average of seventy to eighty films per year. Since last year, Egyptian studios have also begun to produce color films and widescreen films. In terms of screening institutions, Egypt now has three hundred and fifty-eight cinemas, with one hundred and six in the capital Cairo alone. The larger cinemas can accommodate around three thousand viewers.
    From the films screened during this "Egyptian Film Week," we can further understand that Egyptian filmmakers have not only made outstanding achievements in mastering film technology, but are also talented in familiarizing themselves with and applying film art techniques. From these films, it can also be seen that Egyptian screenwriters are trying to take the kind, upright, and simple ordinary working people as the positive forces praised in their films, while giving appropriate exposure to the hypocritical and malicious exploiters and oppressors. Opposition to colonial aggression and promotion of patriotism are reflected to varying degrees in all their films. At the same time, we deeply feel that the Egyptian people and Egyptian filmmakers are working with a high degree of patriotism and a strong sense of national pride, full of confidence and courageously forging ahead for the present and future of their motherland. The Egyptian film industry will become more prosperous under their efforts!

    埃及电影事业的发展
    金声
    埃及在1955年以前，一直是非洲和阿拉伯各国唯一能够生产影片的国家，因此，过去埃及的进步影片也是唯一能够正确反映非洲和阿拉伯人民的思想、表现和描写阿拉伯人民的风俗习惯和宗教信仰的影片。这些优秀的埃及影片不仅深为非洲和阿拉伯国家的人民所喜爱，并且也向全世界电影观众展示了有着悠久文化艺术的传统埃及人民的才能；和对西方国家特别是好莱坞影片商们所拍摄的专门嘲笑、歪曲和有损于阿拉伯人民、为殖民主义作宣传的反动影片予以有力的反击。
    埃及电影还是比较年青的。1927年，才摄制了埃及第一部故事片“柴那勃”。这是一部描写在封建传统和旧礼教压榨下如何葬送了一个无辜的年轻姑娘生命的悲剧影片。这部影片从1928年4月开始公开放映后，在埃及人民中留下了很深的印象。埃及民族电影诞生后的最初几年发展比较缓慢，直到1934年多果·米查奇在巴哥斯建立了第一座摄影场以后，才算正式奠定了埃及制片事业的基础。1935年在开罗和古查相继建立了摄影场，开始大量摄制影片。到第二次大战开始时止，共摄制了四十多部有声影片。其中以1936年古查“米斯尔制片厂”摄制的影片“蕙达”较成功，这是描写一对青年恋人悲欢离合的爱情片。与此同时也摄制了一些暴露当时封建社会制度的影片。
    第二次世界大战爆发以后，随着埃及电影事业的发展，不少投机商人进入了电影界，拍摄了很多迎合观众低级趣味的质量低劣的影片。到1952年埃及革命时止，在埃及电影市场上放映的埃及片多数是历史片、歌舞片和社会片。当然，这个时期法鲁克检查机关对有进步倾向的影片所采取的扼杀手段，也是迫使一些艺术家脱离现实而逃避到神话、传奇和歌舞题材上去的原因之一。
    1952年7月，埃及人民在纳赛尔总统的领导下，推翻了法鲁克封建王朝的统治，建立了共和国，至此，埃及电影事业也才得到了良好的发展条件。共和国建立不久，埃及国家指导委员会即向电影界提出了：“我们要有使观众可以学到一些东西的高明故事。所有新的影片都应该具有文化价值、社会意义和文献价值。……我们认为运用电影来教育群众是非常必要的。”共和国政府并对电影审查等制度作了较大的改进。这些新的措施深深地鼓舞了埃及电影工作者。从1952年埃及摄制的影片来看，在内容上显然现实主义现代题材的影片有了显著的增加。这些影片多方面地表现了埃及人民的愿望，以及他们在法鲁克统治时期所遭受的种种苦难。埃及共和国政府建立后对于本国电影的积极扶植，还表现在埃及电影企业较过去有着更为迅速的发展上。目前埃及已有八十六个电影公司，七个电影制片厂，其中金字塔和埃及两电影制片厂不仅设备新颖，而且规模也相当庞大。这些制片厂平均每年生产七八十部影片。由去年起埃及制片厂并且已开始摄制彩色片和宽银幕影片。在放映机构方面埃及现在有三百五十八家电影院，仅首都开罗一地即有一百零六家，较大的影院能容纳三千左右的观众。
    从这次“埃及电影周”映出的影片中我们更可以了解到：埃及电影工作者不仅在掌握电影技术方面做出了较出色的成绩，而且对于熟悉和运用电影艺术技巧上也是有才能的。从这些影片中还可以看出，埃及电影剧作者力图把善良、正直和淳朴的普通劳动人民作为他的影片中所称赞的积极力量，而对于伪善和恶毒的剥削者和压迫者则给予适当的揭发。反对殖民侵略、宣扬爱国主义精神在他们所有影片中都在不同程度上反映出来。同时我们深切地感到：埃及人民和埃及电影工作者是怀着高度的爱国主义的精神和强烈的民族自豪感，信心百倍、勇往直前地在为自己祖国的今天和未来劳动着。埃及电影事业将在他们的努力下更加繁荣起来！
