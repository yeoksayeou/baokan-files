Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 2nd: The staff of Changchun Film Studio, in a three-day anti-rightist meeting from August 29th to 31st, exposed the "White Building" anti-Party group centered on rightist elements within the Communist Party, such as directors Sha Meng, Guo Wei, and Lü Ban. This anti-Party group gradually developed from an anti-Party undercurrent of the former "White Building" (Changying director dormitory) club during the period of extensive airing of views. Later, they took advantage of the opportunity of Changying's reform of the system to carry out conspiratorial activities, put forward a capitalist program, continued to expand the anti-Party ranks, and launched a frenzied attack on the Communist Party and the people's film industry in an organized, programmed, strategic, and planned manner.

Sha Meng, who himself admitted to being the leader of the "White Building" club, was originally a member of the Changying Communist Party Committee. During the extensive airing of views, he actually became the leader of the rightist elements in Changying, playing a role in mobilizing and calling on the rightist elements to attack the Party. On May 18th, when Huang Can, Li Hua, the Party group leader of the Changying director group, and Liu Xilin, the deputy secretary of the Party committee, had a dispute over the timing and steps of carrying out the airing of views, Liu Xilin, because he was somewhat agitated while speaking, slapped the table with the drafting ruler in his hand. Huang Can and Li Hua exaggerated the facts and told the directors that Liu Xilin was "wielding a stick" and wanted to use a stick to beat people. Sha Meng, as a member of the Party committee, did not clarify the facts, did not first conduct research within the Party committee, and did not explain to the directors, but instead incited the masses. When Ren Sun proposed "petitioning" the Provincial Party Committee, Sha Meng actively supported sending people to the Jilin Provincial Party Committee to "petition." During the "petition," they insisted that the secretary of the Provincial Party Committee participate in the directors' airing of views meeting, otherwise, the meeting would not be held. Those who participated in this "petition" included Lü Ban, Ren Sun, Huang Can, and Li Hua.

Subsequently, the secretaries of the Jilin Provincial Party Committee and the Changchun Municipal Party Committee convened a meeting of the Changying Party Committee to resolve the issue of Party members "petitioning." At the meeting, the leaders of the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees particularly emphasized that the Changying Party Committee should strengthen collective leadership, and any Party member must implement matters decided by the Party Committee and must not engage in activities that violate the decisions of the Party Committee. However, after the meeting, Sha Meng violated the instructions of the Party Committee and strongly advocated expanding the scope of trouble-making within the Party. Sha Meng announced to the directors: in this "battle," "we must overthrow several leaders, and some of us may also fall; whoever falls is considered a glorious sacrifice."

Because the rightist elements within the Party took the lead in the anti-Party activities and lit the first fire with the "petition" method, the rightist elements in Changying became even more unscrupulous in attacking the Party, and successively occurred the anti-Party trouble-making activities such as the "petition" by the translation film directors and actors and the usurpation of the Party's leadership by the Changying Orchestra, creating a smoky atmosphere. Rightist elements such as Sha Meng claimed that this was "airing of views both inside and outside the Party," was an "internal and external attack" on Changying's bureaucracy, and was opening a "breakthrough" in Changying.

This anti-Party group thought that they had gained the upper hand in politically attacking the Party and also attempted to take advantage of the opportunity of Changying's reform of the system to further attack the Party in order to achieve their goal of abolishing the Party's leadership over the film industry. According to the exposure at the meeting and Guo Wei's confession, their creative group wanted to abolish the Party's leadership from the economic to the political, from the artistic to the administrative, and drag the people's film industry onto the capitalist road.

The leader of this anti-Party group, Sha Meng, although a Party member who joined in 1945, still retains his bourgeois intellectual stand. People revealed that deep in his thoughts, he believed that being a "Party member" was far less glorious than being an "artistic master." Guo Wei is a feature film director at Changying. Although he has been a Party member for eighteen years, he has always relaxed his ideological transformation. He considers himself "young and promising," is arrogant and conceited, has no regard for organization, and calls himself a "longtime liberal." After he directed "Dong Cunrui" in 1955, he became even more arrogant and recklessly pursued fame and profit.

### 长影“小白楼”反党集团穷凶极恶  沙蒙郭维吕班率队向党冲锋  提出一套资本主义纲领妄想把电影事业推向歧途

    长影“小白楼”反党集团穷凶极恶
    沙蒙郭维吕班率队向党冲锋
    提出一套资本主义纲领妄想把电影事业推向歧途
    据新华社长春2日电  长春电影制片厂的职工在8月29日到31日一连三天的反右派大会上，揭露出以共产党内的右派分子导演沙蒙、郭维、吕班等为中心的“小白楼”反党集团。这个反党集团是在大鸣大放期间由过去“小白楼”（长影导演宿舍）俱乐部的一股反党暗流逐渐发展而成的。以后又利用长影改革体制的机会进行阴谋活动，提出了资本主义的纲领，继续扩大反党的队伍，有组织、有纲领、有策略、有计划地向共产党和人民电影事业发动了猖狂进攻。
    自己承认是“小白楼”俱乐部首领的沙蒙，原是长影中共党委委员。他在大鸣大放中实际上成了长影右派分子的首领，在右派分子向党进攻中起了动员和号召的作用。5月18日，长影导演组党小组长黄粲、李华和党委副书记刘西林在开展鸣放的时间和步骤问题上发生争执时，刘西林因为说话时有些激动，用手中握着的美工尺拍了桌子，黄粲、李华就夸大事实向导演们说刘西林“耍棍子”要用棍子打人。沙蒙作为党委委员不问清是非、不首先在党委内部进行研究，不向导演们作解释，反而向群众进行煽动。当荏荪提出向省委“请愿”时，沙蒙积极支持派人到吉林省委“请愿”。他们在“请愿”时，坚持要求省委书记参加导演的鸣放会议，否则就不开会。参加这次“请愿”的有吕班、荏荪、黄粲、李华。
    接着，中共吉林省委和长春市委书记召集了长影党委开会，解决党员“请愿”问题。会上省、市委领导人特别强调长影党委要加强集体领导，党委决定的事情任何党员必须执行，不能进行违反党委决定的活动。但是会后沙蒙却违反党委的指示，极力主张扩大党内闹事范围。沙蒙向导演们宣布：这次“作战”“要整倒几个领导人，我们自己也可能躺下几个，谁躺下算光荣牺牲”。
    由于党内右派分子在反党活动中打先锋，用“请愿”的方式放起第一把火后，长影的右派分子就更加肆无忌惮地向党进攻，接连发生了翻译片导演、演员上书“请愿”和长影乐团篡夺党的领导权等反党闹事活动，弄得乌烟瘴气。沙蒙等右派分子声称这是“党内外一齐鸣放”，是对长影官僚主义的“内外夹攻”，是在打开长影的“缺口”。
    这个反党集团以为他们在政治上向党进攻已经得势，还企图利用长影改革体制机会，进一步向党进攻，来达到他们取消党对电影事业领导的目的。据大会揭露和郭维交代，他们这个创作集团是要从经济到政治，从艺术到行政取消党的领导，把人民电影事业拖向资本主义道路。
    这个反党集团的首领沙蒙，虽然是1945年入党的党员，但是他至今保留着他的资产阶级旧知识分子的立场。人们揭露，在他的思想深处，认为作一个“党员”远不如作一个“艺术大师”光荣。郭维是长影的故事片导演。他入党虽然已经十八年，但一向放松对自己的思想改造。他自以为“年轻有为”，骄傲自大，目无组织，自称是“老牌自由主义”。1955年，他导演了“董存瑞”后，更是骄气十足，不顾一切地追名求利。
