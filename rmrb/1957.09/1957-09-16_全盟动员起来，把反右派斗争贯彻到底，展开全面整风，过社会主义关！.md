　　Mobilize the entire league, carry the anti-Rightist struggle through to the end, launch a comprehensive rectification campaign, and pass the socialist test!
　　Abstract of a report by Shi Liang, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, at the National Rectification Work Conference of the Democratic League on the 13th.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 14th. Shi Liang, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, on behalf of Chairman Shen Junru of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Democratic League and the Central Rectification Leadership Group, delivered a report entitled "Mobilize the Entire League, Carry the Anti-Rightist Struggle Through to the End, Launch a Comprehensive Rectification Campaign, and Pass the Socialist Test!" at the National Rectification Work Conference of the Democratic League on the 13th.

Shi Liang said: The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the rectification work of our league, mainly the work of the anti-Rightist struggle.

The rectification movement of our league, centered on the anti-Rightist struggle, which began in mid-June, has only been going on for three months. In these three months, China's great socialist revolution has reached a new climax on the political and ideological fronts, and a fierce struggle between the capitalist road and the socialist road is currently unfolding. As far as our league is concerned, this is a very special period and a turning point in the history of the league. From the Central Committee of the League to local organizations, a large number of league members have joined the battle to counterattack the bourgeois Rightist elements. The anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist alliance of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji has been nakedly exposed and is beginning to disintegrate. Some of the members of the Zhang-Luo alliance and other Rightist elements within the league who have been exposed have begun to bow their heads and confess their guilt, while others are still resisting and quibbling; most have exposed their ugly faces and are isolated in front of the masses. Due to the initial victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, most of the league members who were deceived by the Rightist elements in the past have awakened. Many league members actively and bravely participate in the struggle within the league and in their respective work units. In the Central Committee of the League and several local organizations, the evil atmosphere has declined, the upright atmosphere has risen, and a vigorous new atmosphere has begun to emerge. The organization and members of the league are undergoing profound education and major tests.

Shi Liang said that in order to make us clearly understand the serious significance of this struggle that is currently underway, it is necessary for us to explain the overall situation of the league before the start of the anti-Rightist struggle, especially the situation in the year since the three major transformations entered their climax in 1956.

The struggle between the two lines, the struggle between the left and the right, within the Democratic League did not begin in recent years. From the time of its establishment, our league has been an organization with a united front nature, most of whom are bourgeois intellectuals, as well as national capitalists, patriotic elements from the feudal landlord class, and revolutionary intellectuals. Therefore, in the stage of the democratic revolution, the political division of left, middle, and right was inevitably formed within the league.

After the national liberation, capitalist economy still existed among the five economic components of the New Democracy, and the private ownership of the means of production had not yet been eliminated. At that time, there was already a struggle between the capitalist and socialist roads within the league. In these years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the league carried out a series of tasks and achieved certain victories. Through the five major movements, it helped some league members accept transformation. However, Rightist elements such as Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji have never accepted transformation. They did not truly pass the test in the stage of the democratic revolution, or they used two-faced tactics to muddle through. In the stage of the socialist revolution, they became staunch anti-Communist and anti-socialist diehards. From the facts revealed in the anti-Rightist struggle, after liberation, Rightist elements like Zhang Bojun lurked, observed the situation, and probed the atmosphere, secretly carrying out anti-Communist and anti-socialist activities. Another group of Rightist elements, such as Luo Longji, organized anti-Communist conspiracy groups, using factionalism within the league as a cover, uniting backward elements and those dissatisfied with the Party, and trying their best to win over, deceive, and incite some senior intellectuals in the league who were in a politically intermediate state, and attacking and excluding the leftists. These activities were carried out in an open or concealed manner, with the aim of enabling the Rightist anti-Communist group to control the majority within the league, so that a small number of Rightist elements could become the "power holders" within the league, seize the real power of the league, and finally use the organization of the league and their position in the league to carry out anti-Communist and anti-socialist activities.

In 1956, with the arrival of the high tide of the three major transformations, profound and fundamental changes took place in China's political situation. Bourgeois intellectuals lost their original economic base—capitalist ownership. As the saying goes, "If the skin is gone, what can the hair attach to?" They either determined to change their political stance, attach themselves to the socialist economy, and take the socialist road, or they could only make desperate struggles and plot the restoration of capitalism; there was no middle road. Thus, a sharp struggle between the capitalist and socialist roads was aroused among bourgeois intellectuals. This struggle, reflected within the Democratic League, also appeared very fierce. Zhang Bojun, the Rightist chieftain, and his henchmen began to collude with the original Luo Longji anti-Communist conspiracy group, forming a staunch anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist political alliance. From the second half of 1956, the Rightist line of the Zhang-Luo alliance gradually gained dominance within the league. Before the great blooming and contending and the rectification of the Chinese Communist Party, at the National Work Conference of our league in March and April this year, the Zhang-Luo alliance had already issued a mobilization call to attack the Party and socialism. Finally, in the rampant attack of the national bourgeois Rightists, they played a backbone role.

The facts revealed in the anti-Rightist struggle prove that in the past year, the Zhang-Luo alliance and other Rightist elements used the name of the Democratic League and their positions within and outside the league to carry out criminal anti-Communist and anti-socialist activities, making the political line and political direction of the Democratic League gradually rightist, deviating from the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist road. When the Party's rectification began, their attacks on the Party became even more rampant. They attempted to usurp the Party's leadership in culture, education, science, technology, and other fields. Zhang Bojun, in his capacity as Vice Chairman of the Democratic League, even tampered with Chairman Mao's speech, fabricated the lie of abolishing the school Party committee system, and spread it through the league's organizations at all levels, inciting the evil wind of opposing the leadership of the Communist Party in universities and colleges across the country. He also advocated the establishment of a "Political Design Institute" to undermine the Party's core leadership. Luo Longji advocated the establishment of a "Rehabilitation Committee," creating public opinion and undermining the anti-espionage movement. Members of the Zhang-Luo alliance drafted an anti-socialist scientific program. On June 6, Zhang Bojun and six Rightist professors made a very arrogant assessment of the situation at the CPPCC Cultural Club, believing that by taking advantage of the Communist Party's rectification, setting fires everywhere, and inciting students, workers, and peasants to create "chaos in the world" and overthrow the people's regime, they could realize the restoration of capitalism. This action reached the peak of the Rightist elements' rampant attack on the Party and socialism.

The real purpose of the Rightist elements' countless criminal words and deeds during this period was to overthrow the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party and to overthrow the socialist system. This is a complete violation of the Constitution and the league's charter, and runs counter to the solemn slogan of "Everything for Socialism" put forward by the Second National Congress of the League.

The facts that have been revealed also prove that the reactionary organizational line of the Zhang-Luo alliance has also replaced the correct organizational line of the league to a certain extent. The reactionary organizational line of the Zhang-Luo alliance is to unite and win over the rightists and other bad elements among the bourgeois intellectuals, to win over, deceive, and incite the middle-of-the-roaders, and to exclude and attack the leftists. They tampered with the organizational policy of combining consolidation and development, which was solemnly decided by the previous central meetings of the Democratic League, and advocated vicious large-scale development, destroying the agreement on the division of labor with emphasis on social activities among the democratic parties. They advocated abolishing the organizational policy of focusing on culture and education, the middle and upper strata, and large and medium-sized cities. The purpose was to open the door to backward elements and even reactionary elements, and to develop organizations in rural areas and small cities.

Why were the Zhang-Luo alliance and other Rightist elements able to deceive and incite many members of the league and intellectuals to deviate from the leadership of the Party and the socialist road? In addition to the weaknesses of the intellectuals themselves, the main reason is that Rightist elements generally have a set of vicious and insidious two-faced tactics. They used the Chinese Communist Party's proposal and the democratic parties' desire for long-term coexistence and mutual supervision to negate the Communist Party's leadership and the people's democratic dictatorship. They used the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend to try to achieve the restoration of reactionary bourgeois academic thought. They used anti-dogmatism as a guise to peddle revisionism and oppose the ideological transformation of intellectuals. They used the name of "protecting scientists" to lure scientists into the anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist mire.

The Rightist elements' two-faced tactics are very insidious. They attacked the weaknesses of the bourgeois intellectuals' two-sided nature, so that most of the league members who had not been transformed, mainly senior intellectuals, were unconsciously caught in the Zhang-Luo alliance's conspiracy.

It should be affirmed that our league encountered an unprecedentedly serious crisis in a certain period. If the leading Party had not sounded the alarm in time, and if the people of the whole country had not launched a counterattack against the bourgeois Rightist elements, there might still be many comrades who were kept in the dark, and the crisis of our league would have developed to an irreparable point. These situations are very serious. Chairman Mao taught us that as long as we learn from the lessons, bad things can be turned into good things. What lessons should we learn? In the stage of socialist revolution, there are only two roads for bourgeois intellectuals. If they do not resolve to accept transformation and completely change their bourgeois stance to serve the workers and peasants and serve socialism, they will inevitably embark on the road of anti-Communism, anti-people, and anti-socialism. To accept transformation and change their bourgeois political stance to the working-class stance is to pass the socialist test. The Democratic League is a political group composed mainly of bourgeois intellectuals, so it must also thoroughly transform its political stance, political line, and organizational line, take the socialist road, and serve socialism. That is to say, the Democratic League must pass the socialist test. Promoting the Democratic League and its members to pass the socialist test is the serious task of our league at the present stage.

Next, Shi Liang analyzed the two-sided nature of bourgeois intellectuals. She said that the members of the Democratic League and the masses it is connected with are mainly middle and upper-level intellectuals, who are basically bourgeois intellectuals. The two-sided nature of the Chinese national bourgeoisie is also clearly reflected in the intellectuals cultivated by this class.

In the stage of socialist revolution, what is the two-sided nature of bourgeois intellectuals? The positive side is that, to varying degrees, they tend to take the socialist road, accept the leadership of the Communist Party, and are willing to use their talents to serve socialism. The negative side is that they have basically not abandoned the bourgeois stance and still have some nostalgia for the capitalist system and the so-called democracy and freedom of the bourgeoisie.

The issue of the two-sided nature of intellectuals was not very prominent in the first few years after liberation. This is because the five major movements mainly solved the problems left over from the democratic revolution. At that time, the five economic components still existed simultaneously, and bourgeois ideology was still legal. Therefore, the ideological situation of intellectuals could still adapt to objective reality to a certain extent.

However, when the socialist revolution has won a decisive victory and socialist ownership has basically become the only economic foundation of our country, the situation is completely different. Bourgeois intellectuals have lost their economic foundation—capitalist ownership. The socialist revolution requires that on the basis of changing ownership, society be transformed according to the image of the working class and a new socialist life be established. That is to say, intellectuals are required to change their original stance, sever the myriad ties with the bourgeoisie, and honestly serve the working class. This is not something that ordinary bourgeois intellectuals can easily accept. In this way, the two-sided nature of intellectuals is prominently manifested in the sharp struggle between the two roads: their positive side leads to the socialist road, and their negative side leads to the capitalist road.

The new political division of the three forces of the left, middle, and right within the Democratic League was produced under this situation. Some people, including the leftists and centrists of the democratic revolution, continued to carry forward their enthusiasm, overcome their negativity, and generally abandoned the capitalist stance and turned to the working-class stance, becoming the leftists of the socialist revolution. Of course, this only accounts for a minority of the members of the Democratic League. Some of the original leftists have also become centrists, and individual ones have even degenerated into rightists. Generally speaking, bourgeois intellectuals are still centrists, which also reflects the current basic situation of the league. Their attitude towards the socialist system and the capitalist system is still wavering and hesitant; they are still incompatible with the collectivist life; they still lack common feelings and language with the working people; and they still yearn for the old society and the old life. In short, they cannot wholeheartedly accept the leadership of the Communist Party and take the socialist road. And the Rightist elements resolutely resisted the socialist revolution and socialist transformation, and opposed the leadership of the Communist Party and taking the socialist road.

Facts have proved that Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji used the dark, backward, and negative side of bourgeois intellectuals to win over and strive for the majority, form a political alliance, and gradually seize leadership, thereby causing the Democratic League to lose its political direction. This is worthy of serious vigilance from every comrade.

From this, it can be seen that the two-sided nature of bourgeois intellectuals is incompatible with the tasks of the socialist revolution. For bourgeois intellectuals, the transition from the democratic revolution stage to the socialist revolution stage is a process of thorough transformation, a process of rebirth. For the Democratic League, which is mainly composed of bourgeois intellectuals, the transition from the democratic revolution stage to the socialist revolution stage is also a process of thorough transformation, a process of rebirth. Therefore, the most urgent and serious task before us is to carry out the education of "destroying the capitalist stance and establishing the socialist stance" for our entire league, and to thoroughly transform the league members individually and the league collectively, to pass the socialist test. For the league organization and for the league members individually, this is the most serious test.

How to implement this serious political task? First of all, we must resolutely and deeply launch the struggle against the bourgeois Rightists in the central and local leading organs, and deepen the struggle into the grassroots organizations. On the basis of the victory of the struggle, carry out the rectification movement of the entire league, and use the six criteria put forward by Chairman Mao to correct the political face, organizational face, and political stance of each league member of the Democratic League. This is only the first step in carrying out collective and personal transformation and passing the socialist test, but it is also the most important step.

Regarding how to universally and deeply launch the anti-Rightist struggle at present, Shi Liang put forward the following suggestions based on the Democratic League's policy on the anti-Rightist struggle:

(1) Resolutely and thoroughly defeat the Rightists. The anti-Rightist struggle is a struggle related to the life and death of the socialist cause and a struggle that determines China's destiny. This struggle must be carried out resolutely and thoroughly. In order to win the victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, we must thoroughly criticize and expose the Rightist elements, especially the Rightist backbone elements. The experience of the three months of struggle has proved that some Rightist elements are very stubborn and very cunning. As long as there is a little bit of appeasement and sentimentality in the struggle, they will take advantage of it.

It must be recognized that appeasement and tolerance towards Rightist elements, and taking a bystander or reserved attitude towards the struggle, is a manifestation of right-leaning thinking. We must overcome right-leaning thinking, overcome all sentimentalism, and actively and bravely throw ourselves into the battle, so that everyone can be tempered and educated in the struggle. The more resolute and thorough the struggle against the Rightists, the more it can educate the majority of people and isolate the Rightist elements. At the same time, the counterattack against the Rightists should not adopt simple and rude methods or make decisions on organizational punishments too early, as this is also not good for the entire struggle. At present, there are still many Rightist elements at the grassroots level who have not been identified. Some people say that there are Rightists in other places, but there will be no Rightists in our unit, so there is no need to carry out the struggle. This kind of thinking is very harmful. There are also some people who are afraid that the scope of the attack on the Rightists is too broad and the time is too long, and they advocate a hasty end. It should be known that the anti-Rightist should be based on seeking truth from facts. We should not treat middle-leaning elements as Rightists, but we must never let real Rightist elements get away with it. As for the Rightist elements who are very stubborn, want to resist to the end, and deny to the end, and do not accept transformation, they will inevitably fall into complete isolation and cut themselves off from the people. This is their own fault, and we have done our best.

(2) Unite the middle and win over the majority. The key to the complete victory of the anti-Rightist struggle lies in mobilizing the vast number of league members, uniting the centrists, and everyone joining the battle together. Among the intellectuals, the majority in number are those who have not yet abandoned the capitalist stance, but it is possible to win them over to the left. These are the people who are hesitant and wavering in politics. Winning them over means winning over the majority.

In order to mobilize the vast number of league members to join the battle, it is necessary to carry out very detailed and patient work. They must be made fully aware of the great significance of the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification campaign, and the crimes of the Zhang-Luo alliance and other Rightist elements must be fully exposed and criticized, especially the two-faced tactics used by the Rightist elements to deceive and mislead. It is necessary to dispel concerns, eliminate various ideological obstacles, and encourage them to actively participate in the battle. It is necessary to mobilize the vast number of league members to participate in the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification work as much as possible, but it must also be voluntary and not imposed on them. For those who hold negative ideas about the league, it is necessary to persuade and educate them, explaining the great principles of passing the socialist test, so that they can recognize the serious tasks of the league at the present stage and the important significance of collective and personal transformation. The league will have a future only after rectification and transformation, and individuals will have a future only after transformation.

(3) Deepen the grassroots and comprehensively rectify. The anti-Rightist struggle is a great socialist revolutionary struggle in politics and ideology. Whether this struggle is carried out universally and deeply will have a decisive impact on the league's political stance, organizational face, and the ideological transformation of its members in the future. On the basis of winning the anti-Rightist struggle, general rectification will then be carried out. The general rectification, based on the six criteria put forward by Chairman Mao, combined with the experience of the anti-Rightist struggle, will conduct in-depth study and criticism and self-criticism. The formula of unity-criticism-unity should be followed, and the methods of gentle breeze and drizzle, free debate, mutual assistance, and common progress should be adopted, rather than the method of everyone making a self-examination.

The anti-Rightist struggle and general rectification should not remain in the central and provincial and municipal organizations. They must be carried out comprehensively and deeply in the league's organizations at all levels, down to the branches and groups, under the unified deployment of the Party organization. Every grassroots organization must be involved in the battle, and every member must be tempered and educated in the struggle. At present, the people of the whole country are regarding participation in this struggle and movement as their lofty duty and due responsibility. Our league is a political group, and it is especially necessary to ensure that every member fulfills this responsibility.

(4) Strengthen leadership and improve work. The leading organs must rely on progressive forces with firm political stances as the backbone and unite the centrist forces to participate in the leading organs, in order to promote the work.

In the anti-Rightist and rectification campaigns, we must pay attention to correcting mistakes in work and improving work style at the same time. We must not only ruthlessly defeat the Rightist elements, but also ruthlessly improve our work style and correct our work errors. In the rectification work, we must resolutely prevent complacency and be good at consulting with the vast number of league members, working together, and expanding and improving our ranks through this struggle.

Shi Liang finally emphasized that in order to ensure that the league's comprehensive rectification campaign centered on the anti-Rightist struggle achieves a complete victory, and in order to thoroughly transform the league's organization and members and pass the socialist test, the fundamental key lies in sincerely accepting the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The democratic parties have no experience in carrying out rectification, and it is especially necessary to rely closely on the leadership of the Communist Party in order to correctly understand and grasp the principles and policies and not lose direction in the struggle. The main purpose of our rectification is to bring the league's organization and members closer to the Party and truly accept the Party's leadership and supervision, so that the Democratic League can truly become a political force serving socialism, creating conditions for long-term coexistence and mutual supervision with the Communist Party. The Party supports our work, and the Party expects our league and its members to be tempered and tested in the great socialist revolution, to carry out self-transformation, and to embark on the glorious socialist road. We ask the league's organization and every member to move further closer to the Party in this movement, truly accept the Party's leadership, and live up to the Party's expectations of us. We must use greater determination and perseverance to carry the struggle through to the end. We fully believe that, under the correct leadership and strong support of the great Chinese Communist Party, we will be able to completely smash the Zhang-Luo alliance and all anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist Rightist elements, and, on the basis of the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, carry out the rectification of the entire league, thoroughly transforming the political stance of the majority of league members and the political and organizational face of the league. Through this fierce class struggle, we believe that both the league and its members can pass the socialist test.

### 全盟动员起来，把反右派斗争贯彻到底，展开全面整风，过社会主义关！

　　全盟动员起来，把反右派斗争贯彻到底，展开全面整风，过社会主义关！
　　中国民主同盟副主席史良13日在民盟全国整风工作会议上报告的摘要
    中国民主同盟副主席史良代表民盟中央常务委员会沈钧儒主席和中央整风领导小组13日在民盟全国整风工作会议上作了题为：“全盟动员起来，把反右派斗争贯彻到底，展开全面整风，过社会主义关！”的报告。
    史良说：这次会议的目的是讨论本盟整风工作，主要的是反右派斗争的工作。
    从6月中旬开始的以反右派斗争为中心的本盟整风运动，到现在还不过三个月。这三个月中我国伟大的社会主义革命在政治、思想战线上达到了新的高潮，目前正在展开一场资本主义道路和社会主义道路的剧烈斗争。就本盟来说，这是非常时期，是盟的历史的一个转折点。从盟中央到地方组织广大盟员投入了反击资产阶级右派分子的战斗。反共、反人民、反社会主义的章伯钧、罗隆基联盟已经赤裸裸地被揭露出来，并且正在开始瓦解。章罗联盟的成员和其他已经揭发的盟内右派分子，一部分开始低头认罪，一部分还在抵赖狡辩；大部分暴露出丑恶面目，在群众面前陷于孤立。由于反右派斗争的初步胜利，过去被右派分子蒙蔽的盟员大部分惊醒过来。许多盟员在盟内和在各自的工作单位内，积极地勇敢地参加斗争。在盟中央和若干地方组织内，邪气下降，正气上升，开始出现蓬勃的新气象，盟的组织和成员正在受到深刻的教育和重大的考验。
    史良说，为了使我们明确认识目前正在进行的这一场斗争的严重意义，我们有必要说明一下盟在反右派斗争开始以前的总的情况，特别是1956年三大改造进入高潮以后这一年来的情况。
    民盟内部有两条道路的斗争，左和右的斗争，并不是从最近几年来才开始的。我们盟从成立的时候起，就是一种统一战线性质的组织，其中很大部分是资产阶级知识分子，此外还有民族资本家，从封建地主阶级出身的爱国分子和革命知识分子等。因此在民主革命阶段中，盟内就不可避免地形成左、中、右的政治分野。
    全国解放以后，新民主主义五种经济成分中，仍然存在着资本主义经济，生产资料的私有制还没有消灭。在当时，盟内已经存在着资本主义和社会主义两条道路的斗争。盟在这几年内，在中国共产党的领导下，作了一系列的工作，并取得了一定的胜利。通过五大运动，帮助部分盟员接受了改造。但是章伯钧、罗隆基等右派分子始终没有接受改造，他们在民主革命阶段中，并没有真正过关，或者是用两面手法蒙混过关的，到了社会主义革命阶段中，他们成为坚决反共、反社会主义的顽固分子。从反右派斗争中揭露的事实来看，解放以后像章伯钧之类的右派分子，潜伏下来，观风色，摸气候，暗中进行反共、反社会主义。另一批右派分子罗隆基等，组织反共阴谋集团，以搞盟内宗派作掩护，团结落后分子和对党不满的分子，竭力笼络、蒙蔽、煽惑盟内一些政治上处于中间状态的高级知识分子，打击、排斥左派，这些活动是用公开或隐蔽的方式进行的，其目的在于使右派反共集团，得以控制盟内多数，使少数右派分子成为盟内“当权派”，掌握了盟的实权，最后利用盟的组织和他们在盟内的地位，进行反共、反社会主义的活动。
    到了1956年，三大改造的高潮到来，我国政治形势发生了深刻的根本的变化。资产阶级知识分子丧失了原来的经济基础——资本主义所有制，“皮之不存，毛将焉附”？他们不是决心改变自己的政治立场，附着在社会主义经济上，走社会主义道路，就只有作绝望的挣扎，阴谋资本主义的复辟，中间的道路是没有的。于是，在资产阶级知识分子中间引起了资本主义和社会主义两条道路的尖锐斗争。这一场斗争反映在民盟内部，也显得十分激烈。章伯钧这个右派头子和他的党羽，同原来的罗隆基反共阴谋集团开始勾结在一起，结成了坚决反共、反人民、反社会主义的政治联盟。从1956年下半年起，章罗联盟的右派路线，就在盟内逐步占了优势，还没有等到大鸣大放和中共整风，就在今年3、4月间的本盟全国工作会议中，章罗联盟已经发出向党向社会主义进攻的动员号召。最后，在全国资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻中，他们扮演了骨干角色。
    在反右派斗争中已经揭发的事实证明：过去一年中，章罗联盟和其他右派分子利用了民盟的名义和他们在盟内盟外的地位，进行了反共、反社会主义的罪恶活动，使民盟的政治路线，政治方向，逐步右倾，离开共产党的领导和社会主义的道路。到了党整风开始，他们对党的进攻更为猖狂了。他们企图篡夺党在文教、科学、技术等方面的领导权。章伯钧竟以民盟副主席的身份窜改毛主席的讲话，捏造出取消学校党委制的谎言，通过盟的各级组织散播下去，煽起全国各地高等学校内反对共产党的领导的歪风。他还主张设立“政治设计院”破坏党的核心领导。罗隆基主张设立“平反委员会”，制造舆论，破坏肃反运动。章罗联盟分子起草了反社会主义的科学纲领。6月6日，章伯钧和右派六教授在政协文化俱乐部对当时形势作了十分狂妄的估计，以为利用共产党整风，到处点火放火，煽动学生和工农，造成“天下大乱”，推翻人民政权，就可以实行资本主义的复辟。这一举动达到右派分子向党向社会主义猖狂进攻的最高峰。
    右派分子在这个时期的无数罪恶言行，真正的目的，在于推翻工人阶级、共产党的领导，推翻社会主义制度。这是完全违反了宪法和盟章，和本盟第二次全国代表大会所提出的“一切为了社会主义”的庄严口号是背道而驰的。
    从已揭发的事实，还证明章罗联盟的反动组织路线，在一定程度上也代替了盟的正确组织路线。章罗联盟的反动组织路线是团结、拉拢资产阶级知识分子中的右派和其他坏分子，笼络、蒙蔽、煽惑中间派，排斥、打击左派。窜改民盟历次中央会议所郑重决定的巩固与发展相结合的组织方针，主张恶性大发展，破坏各民主党派在社会活动方面重点分工的协议。他们主张取消文教为主、中上层为主、大中城市为主的组织方针，其目的就是向落后分子甚至反动分子打开大门，在农村和小城市都发展组织。
    章罗联盟和其他右派分子为什么能够蒙蔽、煽惑盟的不少成员和知识分子，离开党的领导，离开社会主义道路呢？除了知识分子本身存在着一些弱点以外，主要是由于右派分子一般都具有一套恶毒阴险的两面手法。他们利用中国共产党所提出和民主党派长期共存、互相监督的愿望，来否定共产党领导和人民民主专政。他们利用百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，企图达到资产阶级反动的学术思想的复辟。他们以反教条主义作为幌子来贩卖修正主义，反对知识分子的思想改造。他们以“保护科学家”为名，诱骗科学家，使他们陷入反共、反人民、反社会主义的迷途。
    右派分子这种两面手法是十分毒辣的。他们针对着资产阶级知识分子的两面性的弱点进攻，使大多数未经改造的盟员，其中主要是高级知识分子，中了章罗联盟的阴谋诡计而不自觉。
    应该肯定，在一个时期内，我们盟遭遇到了空前未有的严重危机。要不是领导党及时地向我们敲起警钟，不是全国人民发动了对资产阶级右派分子的反击，我们可能还有不少同志蒙在鼓里，我们盟的危机将发展到无可救药的地步。这些情况是十分严重的。毛主席教导我们，只要我们接受教训，坏事也可以转变成为好事。我们接受什么教训呢？在社会主义革命阶段中，资产阶级知识分子的路只有两条。不决心接受改造，彻底改变自己的资产阶级立场，为工农服务，为社会主义服务，就必然走上反共、反人民、反社会主义的绝路。接受改造，改变自己的资产阶级的政治立场为工人阶级立场，这就是过社会主义关。民盟是以资产阶级知识分子为主要成份的政治团体，因此也要彻底改造它的政治立场、政治路线、组织路线，走社会主义道路，为社会主义服务，这也就是说，民盟要过社会主义关。推动民盟和盟员过社会主义关，这就是我们盟在现阶段的严重任务。
    接着，史良分析了资产阶级知识分子的两面性问题。她说，民盟的成员和它所联系的群众主要是中上层知识分子，他们基本上是资产阶级知识分子。中国民族资产阶级的两面性也同时明显地反映在这个阶级所培养出来的知识分子身上。
    在社会主义革命阶段中，资产阶级知识分子的两面性是什么呢？积极性的一面是：在不同程度上，倾向于走社会主义的道路、接受共产党的领导，愿意发挥他们的才能，为社会主义服务。消极性的一面是：基本上没有抛弃资产阶级的立场，对资本主义的制度和资产阶级的所谓民主自由还有所留恋。
    知识分子的两面性问题，在解放后的最初几年内并没有显得很突出。这是因为五大运动所解决的，主要还是民主革命遗留下来的问题。当时五种经济成份还同时存在，资产阶级思想也还是合法的。因此，知识分子的思想状况在一定程度上还能够同客观现实相适应。
    但是，当社会主义革命取得决定性的胜利，社会主义所有制已经基本上成为我们国家唯一的经济基础的时候，情况就完全不同了；资产阶级知识分子失去了他们的经济基础——资本主义所有制。社会主义革命要求在改变所有制的基础上，按照工人阶级的面貌来改造社会，建立社会主义的新生活。这就是说，要求知识分子改变原来的立场，割断同资产阶级的千丝万缕的联系，老老实实地为工人阶级服务，这就不是一般资产阶级知识分子所能轻易接受的了。这样，知识分子的两面性就在两条道路的尖锐斗争中突出地表现出来，他们的积极性的一面通向社会主义的道路，消极性的一面通向资本主义的道路。
    民盟内部左、中、右三种势力的新的政治分野，就是在这种形势下产生的。有一部分人包括民主革命的左派、中间派，继续发扬积极性，克服消极性，一般地已经抛弃了资本主义立场，转到工人阶级立场，成为社会主义革命的左派。这当然只占民盟成员的少数。原来的左派也有一些变为中间派，个别的甚至堕落为右派分子。资产阶级知识分子一般地说仍然还是中间派，这也反映目前盟的基本状况。他们对社会主义制度和资本主义制度的态度还在动摇不定，踌躇不决；对集体主义生活还格格不入；对劳动人民还缺乏共同的感情和语言；对旧社会、旧生活还恋恋不舍。总而言之，还不能死心踏地接受共产党的领导，走社会主义的道路。而右派分子坚决抗拒社会主义革命和社会主义改造，反对共产党的领导和走社会主义的道路。
    事实证明：章伯钧和罗隆基正是利用资产阶级知识分子的阴暗的、落后的、消极的一面来进行拉拢、争取多数，结成政治联盟，逐步夺取领导权，从而使民盟迷失政治方向。这是值得我们每一个同志严重警惕的。
    由此可见，资产阶级知识分子的两面性同社会主义革命的任务是不可调和的。对资产阶级知识分子来说，从民主革命阶段到社会主义革命阶段，是一个彻底改造的过程，是一个脱胎换骨的过程。对于以资产阶级知识分子为主要成分的民盟来说，从民主革命阶段到社会主义革命阶段，同样是一个彻底改造的过程，是一个脱胎换骨的过程。因此，摆在我们面前最迫切的严重任务，就是要对我们全盟进行“破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场”的教育，对盟员个人和盟的集体进行彻底的社会主义改造，过社会主义关。就盟组织来说，就盟员个人来说，这是一次最严重的考验。
    怎样贯彻这一严重的政治任务呢？首先就是要坚决地深入地在中央和地方领导机关展开反击资产阶级右派的斗争，并把斗争深入到基层组织里去。在斗争胜利的基础上，进行全盟的整风运动，按照毛主席所提出的六项标准，来端正民盟的政治面貌、组织面貌和每个盟员的政治立场。这只是进行集体和个人改造，过社会主义关的第一步，然而也是最重要的一步。
    对目前如何普遍深入地展开反右派斗争，史良根据民盟反右派斗争的方针提了以下意见：
    （一）坚决彻底打垮右派。反右派斗争是关系到社会主义事业生死存亡的斗争，是决定我国命运的斗争，这一场斗争必须进行得坚决彻底。为了在政治战线和思想战线上取得社会主义革命的胜利，我们就得对右派分子，特别是右派骨干分子进行彻底的批判和揭露。三个月来的斗争经验证明，右派分子有的是十分顽固，十分狡猾的，在斗争中只要有一点点姑息和温情，就会给他们钻空子。
    必须认识，对右派分子姑息宽容，对斗争采取旁观或保留态度，就是右倾思想的表现。我们必须克服右倾思想，克服一切温情主义，积极地勇敢地投到战斗中去，使大家在斗争中得到锻炼，受到教育。对右派斗争越坚决彻底，越是能够教育大多数人，而使右派分子陷于孤立。同时，反击右派也不能采取简单粗暴的方法，或者过早地作出组织处分的决定，这样对整个斗争也没有好处。现在在基层还有不少右派分子没有被揪出来。有些人说，别的地方有右派，我们的单位中间不会有右派，用不着进行斗争。这种想法是十分有害的。也有一些人害怕打击右派的面太广，时间拖得太久，主张草草收兵。要知道反右派应当实事求是，我们不应把中间偏右的分子当作右派斗，但也决不能让真正的右派分子混过关。至于态度十分顽固的右派分子，要想抗拒到底、抵赖到底，不接受改造，必然会陷于完全孤立，自绝于人民，这是他们咎由自取，我们已经做到仁至义尽了。
    （二）团结中间，争取多数。要使反右派斗争取得完全胜利，关键在于发动广大盟员，团结中间派，大家一道投入战斗。在知识分子中间，在数量上占优势的是那些还没有抛弃资本主义立场，但有可能争取到左边来的，在政治上徘徊不定，左右摇摆的人们，把他们争取过来，就争取到多数人。
    为了发动广大盟员投入战斗，这就必须进行十分细致的耐心的工作。要使他们充分认识反右派斗争和整风的伟大意义，向他们充分揭露和批判章罗联盟及其他右派分子的罪行，特别要揭露右派分子进行欺骗和蒙蔽的两面手法。要解除顾虑，消灭各种思想障碍，鼓舞他们积极参加战斗，要尽量动员广大盟员，参加反右派斗争和整风工作，但也要出于自愿，不可强加于人。对于那些对盟抱消极思想的人，必须加以说服教育，讲清过社会主义关的大道理，使他们认识盟在目前的严重任务，集体和个人改造的重要意义，盟经过整风改造以后才有前途，个人也只有经过改造以后才有前途。
    （三）深入基层，全面整风。反右派斗争是一场伟大的政治上、思想上的社会主义革命斗争，这场斗争进行得是否普遍深入，对本盟的政治立场、组织面貌以及今后成员的思想改造都将发生决定性的作用。在反右派斗争取得胜利的基础上，再进行一般整风。一般的整风根据毛主席所提出的六条标准，结合反右派斗争的经验，进行深入学习和批评、自我批评。要本着团结——批评——团结的公式，采用和风细雨的方法，自由辩论，互相帮助，共同进步，而不要采用人人检讨过关的方法。
    反右派斗争和一般整风不应停留在 中央和省、市组织，必须在盟的各级组织，直到支部和小组，在党组织的统一布署下，全面深入地开展，要使每一个基层组织都投入战斗，要做到每个成员在斗争中得到锻炼和受到教育。目前全国人民都在把参加这一斗争和运动看作自己崇高的义务和应有的责任，我们盟是一个政治团体，尤其要做到每个成员都尽到这个责任。
    （四）加强领导，改进工作。领导机构必须依靠政治立场坚定的进步力量作为骨干，团结中间力量参加领导机构，以利于推动工作。
    在反右派和整风中一定要同时注意改正工作中的错误和改进作风，我们不仅要狠狠地斗垮右派分子，还必须狠狠地改进工作作风，改正工作错误。在整风工作中，我们必须切实防止骄傲自满的情绪，要善于同广大盟员协商办事一道工作，要通过这次斗争把我们的队伍更加扩大和提高起来。
    史良最后着重指出，为了使本盟以反右派斗争为中心的全面整风，取得全胜，为了使盟的组织和成员彻底改造，过社会主义关，根本性的关键在于真心诚意接受中国共产党的领导。民主党派进行整风是没有经验的，尤其必须紧紧依靠共产党的领导，才能正确地领会和掌握方针、政策，不至在斗争中迷失方向。而我们进行整风的主要目的，也就是为了使盟的组织和成员靠拢党，真正接受党的领导和监督，这样才能使民盟真正成为为社会主义服务的政治力量，创造和共产党长期共存、互相监督的条件。党是支持我们的工作的，党期望我们盟和盟员在伟大的社会主义革命中，受到锻炼考验，进行自我改造，踏上光荣的社会主义道路。我们要求盟的组织和每个成员，在这次运动中，更进一步地靠拢党，真正接受党的领导，以不负党对我们的期望。我们一定要用更大的决心和毅力把斗争贯彻到底。我们完全相信，在伟大的中国共产党的正确领导和大力支持下，一定能够彻底粉碎章罗联盟和一切反共、反人民、反社会主义的右派分子，并且在反右派斗争胜利的基础上进行全盟的整风，彻底改造大多数盟员的政治立场和本盟的政治面貌和组织面貌。通过目前这一场激烈的阶级斗争，我们相信本盟和成员都能过社会主义的关。
