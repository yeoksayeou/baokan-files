Around National Day

What Exhibitions are Being Held at the Palace Museum Around National Day?

    To celebrate National Day, the Palace Museum has opened many exhibition halls.

    In the Palace History section, the side halls and back halls of the Hall of Mental Cultivation have been newly opened; at the same time, exhibition rooms have been opened featuring nearly 1,500 jade artifacts and 1,000 lacquerware pieces, which are extremely exquisite handicrafts made by artisans in the Qing Dynasty's Imperial Workshops.

    The International Friendship Hall will hold an exhibition of gifts received by the Chinese government delegation during its visit to eleven Asian and European countries.

    The Yuan Dynasty murals in the Yongle Palace in Yongji County, Shanxi Province, which are famous and occupy a very important position in the history of Chinese painting, have recently been copied by a large group of artists organized by the Cultural Relics Bureau and the Central Academy of Fine Arts. These mural copies will also be exhibited after National Day. In addition, there are the following three exhibitions:

    Newly Opened "Qing Dynasty Art Gallery"

    The "Qing Dynasty Art Gallery" is located at the original site of the Zhongcui Palace and was newly opened on September 19th. This gallery is the last one in the Palace Museum to exhibit comprehensive arts and crafts from past dynasties. The exhibits include over two thousand pieces of world-renowned Chinese handicrafts such as porcelain, embroidery, lacquerware, jade, cloisonné enamel, and iron pictures, which are extremely rich.

    Exhibition of Ancient Textiles and Embroidery

    Fine works of textiles and embroidery from the Song, Ming, and Qing dynasties have been on display at the Hall of Preserving Harmony since September 17th. The exhibits include Zhu Kerou's "Kesi Peony Diagram," a masterpiece of Song Dynasty Kesi (cut silk) artistry, the Song Dynasty's "Embroidery Plum Bamboo Parrot Diagram," the Ming Dynasty's "Kesi Three Autumns Diagram" and "Kesi Peach and Swallow Diagram," as well as the Qing Dynasty's "Embroidery Immortals Celebrating Longevity Diagram" and "Embroidery Sakyamuni Buddha Statue," among other excellent works, totaling more than one hundred and ten pieces.

    China's textile and embroidery art has a long historical tradition. As early as the Qin and Han dynasties, there were ancient books recording it, and it reached its peak in the Song Dynasty. For example, Shen Zipan's "Plum and Magpie Diagram," a Song Dynasty Kesi (silk thread woven paintings with cut weft) master displayed in the Hall of Supreme Harmony of the Palace Museum, vividly portrays the life of plum blossoms and magpies with its skillful craftsmanship, brilliant colors, and realistic depiction, truly resembling a delicate Song Dynasty painting.

    Opening of the Painting Gallery

    China's precious Sui, Tang, Song, and Yuan ancient paintings are scheduled to be exhibited for about two months each autumn, and this year's exhibition opened on September 21st.

    In addition to the more than one hundred pieces of the most ancient famous paintings existing in China that are familiar to everyone, this exhibition also adds four newly collected famous paintings: Han Huang's "Five Oxen Diagram" scroll from the Tang Dynasty, Wang Jucheng's "Spinning Wheel Diagram" scroll from the Song Dynasty, Yang Buzhi's "Four Plum Blossom Diagram" scroll from the Song Dynasty, and Qian Xuan's "Mountain Dwelling Diagram" scroll from the Yuan Dynasty. Among them, "Five Oxen Diagram" and "Four Plum Blossom Diagram" are even rarer treasures. The former uses bold and smooth brushstrokes to depict the different dynamics of the five oxen, with a very lively spirit, while the latter uses concise dry brushstrokes to depict the changes of plum blossoms that are unopened, about to open, in full bloom, and about to wither.

    国庆节前后
    故宫博物院有哪些展览？
    为庆祝国庆节，故宫博物院开放了许多陈列馆。
    宫庭历史部分新开放了养心殿的配殿和后殿；同时开辟了有近一千五百件玉器和一千件漆器的陈列室，是清代宫内造办处工匠所造的极为精致的工艺品。
    国际友谊馆将举办我国政府代表团访问亚欧十一国时所收到的礼品展览。
    有名的山西省永济县永乐宫的元代壁画在中国绘画史上占很重要的地位，最近文物局和中央美术学院曾组织大批美术家前往临摹。这部分壁画临本也将于国庆节后展出。此外，还有以下三个展览：
    新辟“清代艺术馆”
    “清代艺术馆”在锺粹宫原址，系最近新辟，已在9月19日开放。这个馆是故宫博物院继展出历代综合艺美术品的最后一个馆。展品有我国在世界上驰名的工艺品瓷器、刺绣、漆器、玉器、景泰蓝、铁花等二千余件，极为丰富。
    展览古代织绣
    宋、明、清三代织绣佳作已于9月17日起在保和殿展出。展品包括宋代缂丝名手朱克柔的“缂丝壮丹图”和宋人的“刺绣梅竹鹦鹉图”，明代的“缂丝三秋图”和“缂丝蟠桃春燕图”，以及清代的“刺绣群仙供寿图”和“刺绣释迦牟尼佛像”等优秀作品一百一十多件。
    我国的织绣艺术有着悠久的历史传统。早在秦、汉就有古书记载，至宋代已达高峰。像故宫博物院太和殿展陈的宋代缂丝（通经断纬的丝线编织的画）名家沈子潘的“梅雀图”，那手工的巧妙、色彩的艳丽，逼真的刻画出梅花、喜雀的生命感，真宛如一幅细秀的宋人绘画。
    开放绘画馆
    我国珍贵的隋、唐、宋、元古画规定在每年秋季展出约两个月的时间，今年已在9月21日开放。
    这次展出的作品，除了为大家所熟悉的国内现存最古的名画一百多件外，还增添了不久前新征集到的四幅名画：唐代韩晃“五牛图”卷，宋代王居正“纺车图”卷，宋代杨补之“四梅花图”卷，元代钱选“山居图”卷。其中“五牛图”和“四梅花图”更是不可多得的珍品，前者以粗实流畅的笔线写出五条牛儿的不同动态，神气很是活跃，后者以简洁的干笔绘出未开、将开、盛开、将残的梅花变化。
