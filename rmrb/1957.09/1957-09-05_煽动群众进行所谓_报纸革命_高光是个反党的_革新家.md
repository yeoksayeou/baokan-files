Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 4th: Zhejiang Province's news and publishing circles recently held a series of symposiums, exposing the crimes of Gao Guang, a rightist within the Party and Deputy Editor-in-Chief of Zhejiang Daily, who attempted to篡改[cuan gai - tamper with, distort, falsify] the political direction of the Party newspaper and frantically attacked the Party.

  Gao Guang is a member of the Chinese Communist Party. In the second half of last year, taking advantage of his position as acting editor-in-chief, he raised the banner of "renovator" and "anti-dogmatism," instigating the masses in the editorial department to carry out a so-called "newspaper revolution." In his report to the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee on "improving" newspaper work, which he drafted, he first opposed the most fundamental principle of the Party committee leading the Party newspaper. He attacked the consistent serious attitude of the Zhejiang Daily editorial board towards the Party's leadership as "lacking independent judgment, only able to follow behind the leading organs and business departments, unable to think independently." He blamed some of the shortcomings of Zhejiang Daily, along with the lack of subjective efforts of the editors, on the fact that it was a "Party organ newspaper." Gao Guang tried his best to oppose the Party newspaper serving political tasks and central work.

  More seriously, when the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee pointed out Gao Guang's serious mistakes and instructed the newspaper to conduct a serious examination of Gao Guang's newspaper management thinking, Gao Guang consistently refused to correct himself. Later, Gao Guang went to Wenzhou and, under the guise of introducing experience, intensified the selling of his anti-Party newspaper management views to the news media in Wenzhou.

  Among the more than 20 articles written by Gao Guang himself in recent years, with the exception of a few, all maliciously attacked Party organizations and Party cadres. He wantonly丑化[chou hua - to uglify; to defame], satirized and骂骂[man ma - to hurl abuses] Party cadres, comparing them to "昏庸[hun yong - muddle-headed] and ignorant emperors riding on the heads of the people."

  During the "大放大鸣[da fang da ming -Great Blooming and Great Airing]" period, Gao Guang wrote an essay entitled "Disease and Medicine," demanding that the Communist Party tie its own hands and feet and allow rightists to shoot with poisonous arrows. Gao Guang also wrote a poem "Difficult, Difficult," depicting veteran cadres as crude and ignorant people who only knew how to "wave sticks to beat wolves" and only knew "scallions mixed with tofu," and demanding that these "March 8th style" and "1927" veteran cadres "step down" and "get off the sedan chair." When a reporter wrote a incendiary report attacking the CPC Zhejiang Agricultural College Committee, Gao Guang actively advocated its publication, but when the provincial party committee disagreed, he was greatly dissatisfied.

  Rightist Gao Guang also actively participated in the signature campaign initiated by Xie Yu and others, a rightist clique from Zhejiang Daily, to support the Beijing rightist Lin Xiling in attacking the Communist Party.

  Zhejiang Daily and Zhejiang Province's news and publishing circles held more than ten symposiums to expose Gao Guang, achieving a great victory in criticizing reactionary bourgeois journalistic viewpoints and safeguarding the socialist news industry.

    煽动群众进行所谓“报纸革命”
    高光是个反党的“革新家”
    据新华社杭州4日电　浙江省新闻出版界最近连续举行座谈会，揭露了党内右派分子、浙江日报副总编辑高光妄图篡改党报政治方向并猖狂向党进攻的罪恶活动。
  高光是中国共产党员。去年下半年，他趁自己代理总编辑工作的机会，打起了“革新家”和“反教条主义”的招牌，在编辑部内煽动群众进行所谓“报纸革命”。在他起草的给中共浙江省委的“改进”报纸工作的报告中，他首先反对党委领导党报这一最根本的原则。他攻击浙江日报编委会对待党的领导一贯的严肃态度是“没有主见，只能跟在领导机关和业务部门的后面跑，自己无法独立思考。”他把浙江日报的一些缺点连同编辑人员在主观努力上不够的地方都一起归罪于是“党的机关报”这一点上。高光竭力反对党报要为政治任务、中心工作服务。
    更严重的是，当中共浙江省委指出了高光的严重错误，指示报社对高光的办报思想要进行认真的检查以后，高光都始终拒绝改正。后来，高光到了温州，竟以介绍经验为名，向温州市新闻界变本加厉地贩卖他的反党的办报观点。
    高光自己近年来所写的二十多篇文章中，除了个别的以外，都是恶意地攻击党的组织和党的干部的。他百般地丑化、讽刺和谩骂党的干部，把他们比作“骑在人民头上的昏庸无知的皇帝”。
    在“大放大鸣”期间，高光写了一篇题为“病和药”的杂文，要求共产党自缚手足，让右派分子用毒箭射击。高光还写了“难办，难办”的诗，把老干部描绘成只会“抡棍子打狼”、只知“小葱拌豆腐”的粗野无知的人，要这些“三八式”、“二七年”的老干部“下台”、“下轿”。有一个记者写了一篇攻击中共浙江农学院委员会的放火报道，高光积极主张刊登，省委不同意，他就大为不满。
    右派分子高光还积极参加浙江日报右派小集团谢狱等人发起的签名运动，支持北京的右派分子林希翎向共产党进攻。
    浙江日报和浙江省新闻出版界揭露高光的座谈会先后共开了十多次，在批判反动的资产阶级新闻观点和保卫社会主义的新闻事业方面取得了一次很大的胜利。
