Can the "Fundamental Law" Solve the Algerian Problem?
Commentator of this newspaper

The United Nations General Assembly has opened, and the Algerian question has once again been placed on the agenda. This is clearly a major headache for the French government. Because the current situation is very unfavorable to France.

To cope with the difficult situation France will face when the United Nations General Assembly discusses the Algerian question, the French government began a series of diplomatic activities very early on. About three months ago, French Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Joxe made a special trip to Washington to beg for help. Dulles's reply was: The United States can support France again in the United Nations, but France must propose a solution to the Algerian question that is easy for the United States to support. In late August, French Foreign Minister Pineau and Deputy Minister Faure also traveled to Latin America and Southeast Asia to lobby. The effect of these activities is still unknown. But it seems that the French government has finally come to the conclusion that, in order to find the necessary support in the United Nations General Assembly, France must come up with something concrete.

Therefore, French Prime Minister Bourgès-Maunoury hurriedly drafted a so-called "Algerian Fundamental Law" and broke with convention by convening a special meeting of the National Assembly before the end of the summer recess, so as to pass this "Fundamental Law" as soon as possible as a trump card to be thrown out at the United Nations General Assembly.

What is the content of the "Algerian Fundamental Law" draft? French officials said that the "Fundamental Law" stipulates that a "regional autonomy" "political reform" will be implemented in Algeria. Its main point is: to divide Algeria into several regions. Each region will establish a local council elected by elections and a local government appointed by the council. After two years, the local councils will jointly elect a federal council and organize a federal government. It is said that such "political reform" will create favorable conditions for the solution of the Algerian question.

However, what is really important are not these general provisions, but the clauses concerning the future status of Algeria and the nature and method of producing the planned Algerian power organs. After reading these, people can discover how much practical value the so-called "political reform" actually has. The members of the local councils are entirely appointed by the French colonial authorities before the "ceasefire" is realized, and a part of them are still appointed by the French colonial authorities after the "ceasefire." The nature of the federal institutions "elected" by such local councils can be imagined. Moreover, this federal institution is actually only a coordinating institution for the six regions, not a central institution for the entire Algeria, and its power is insignificant. All major national powers such as diplomacy, justice, national defense, police, finance, and resources will still be monopolized by the French resident representatives in Algeria. In the final analysis, France still wants to maintain its colonial rule over Algeria. The first article of the "Fundamental Law" draft clearly states: Algeria is part of France. And the French Foreign Minister has unambiguously stated that France refuses to let Algeria become independent. Therefore, the so-called "regional autonomy" is nothing more than a new trick of colonial rule.

The French government's practice of fundamentally denying the Algerian national entity and attempting to continue to maintain colonial rule under the guise of granting "autonomy" will obviously not help solve the Algerian question. Because the key to solving this problem lies in satisfying the Algerian people's national desire for independence. The representatives of the Algerian National Liberation Front have already pointed out in a letter to the President of the United Nations General Assembly that there is nothing in the "Fundamental Law" worth considering, because it only intends to reaffirm the myth that France enjoys sovereignty in Algeria. Obviously, the Algerian people, who have been fighting for national independence for a long time and are increasingly approaching victory, cannot accept this disguised colonial rule disguised as "autonomy."

The "Fundamental Law" draft proposed by the Bourgès-Maunoury cabinet, which cannot fundamentally solve the Algerian question, has been opposed by domestic democratic and progressive forces and some sober-minded politicians, which is only natural. But what is intriguing is that the "Fundamental Law" draft has also been attacked by right-wing parties. Why is this? Because although the "Fundamental Law" essentially maintains France's colonial rule, a section of the colonialist bloc still worries that even the establishment of such a nominal federal institution may open the door for Algeria to secede from the French Federation. In the cabinet, Minister of National Defense, right-wing Radical Party member Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury opposed the "Fundamental Law" draft, and even threatened to resign to express his protest. In the National Assembly, conservative parliamentarians threatened to veto the bill introduced by the cabinet.

Due to opposition from both the left and right, the French current cabinet, which has not been formed for long, has encountered another crisis. In order to avoid failure, Bourgès-Maunoury mediated in many ways and changed the wording in the draft to be more ambiguous, in order to dispel the concerns of the right-wing parties. He is currently anxiously awaiting the vote of confidence on this issue in the National Assembly before it adjourns on September 30. The French ruling group's quarrel over the "Fundamental Law" issue and the new crisis facing the cabinet illustrate that French colonialism in Algeria is already facing insurmountable difficulties. Their defeat is certain, and neither the "Fundamental Law" nor any other deceptive means can save them.

### “根本法”能解决阿尔及利亚问题吗？

    “根本法”能解决阿尔及利亚问题吗？
    本报评论员
    联合国大会开会了，阿尔及利亚问题已经又被列入了议程。这对法国政府来说显然是一件大伤脑筋的事情。因为，目前的形势对法国是十分不利的。
    为了应付联合国大会讨论阿尔及利亚问题时法国将要遇到的困难局面，法国政府很早就开始进行了一系列外交活动。大约三个月以前，法国外交部秘书长约赛曾经专诚去华盛顿乞助。而杜勒斯的答复是：美国可以在联合国里再度支持法国，但是法国得提出一个美国便于支持的解决阿尔及利亚问题的方案。8月下旬，法国外交部部长比诺和次长富尔也分别到拉丁美洲和东南亚各国去奔走游说。这些活动的效果如何现在还不得而知。但是看来法国政府终于得出一个结论：要在联合国大会中找到必要的支持，法国必须拿出一些具体的东西来。
    于是，法国总理布歇—莫努里急急忙忙地拟出了一个所谓“阿尔及利亚根本法”草案，并且打破惯例要国民议会在夏季休假结束之前召开特别会议，以便及早通过这项“根本法”，作为准备在联合国大会上抛出去的王牌。
    “阿尔及利亚根本法”草案的内容是什么呢？法国官方人士说，“根本法”规定将在阿尔及利亚实现一种“分区自治”的“政治改革”。它的要点是：把阿尔及利亚划分为若干区。每个区设立一个由选举产生的地方议会和一个由议会任命的地方政府。经过两年以后，再由各个地方议会共同选出一个联邦议会并且组织一个联邦政府。据说，这样的“政治改革”将会给阿尔及利亚问题的解决创造有利的条件。
    然而，真正重要的不是这些笼统的规定，而是那些关于阿尔及利亚的未来地位以及计划中的阿尔及利亚权力机关的性质和产生方法的条文。看了这些，人们就可以发现所谓“政治改革”究竟有多少实际价值了。地方议会的议员在“停火”实现以前完全由法国殖民当局任命，在“停火”以后仍然有一部分由法国殖民当局任命。由这样的地方议会“选”出来的联邦机构，其性质就可想而知了。而且这个联邦机构实际上只是六个区域的统筹机构，并不是整个阿尔及利亚的中央机构，其权力是微不足道的。诸凡外交、司法、国防、警察、财政、资源等等主要国家权力，仍然要由法国在阿尔及利亚的驻节代表一手独揽。归根结底，法国仍然要保持它对阿尔及利亚的殖民统治。“根本法”草案的第一条开宗明义就确定：阿尔及利亚为法国的一部分。而且法国外长曾经毫不含糊地说过，法国拒绝让阿尔及利亚独立。因此，所谓“分区自治”，不过是殖民统治的花样翻新而已。
    法国政府这种根本否认阿尔及利亚民族实体，而企图以给予“自治”为幌子继续保持殖民统治的做法，显然不会有助于阿尔及利亚问题的解决。因为解决这一问题的关键，就在于满足阿尔及利亚人民要求独立的民族愿望。阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线代表在给联合国大会主席的信里已经指出，“根本法”中没有一点东西值得考虑，因为它只是打算重新肯定法国在阿尔及利亚享有主权的神话。显然，已经为民族独立进行了长期斗争并日益接近胜利的阿尔及利亚人民，是不可能接受这种用“自治”伪装起来的变相殖民统治的。
    布歇—莫努里内阁提出的这种根本不能解决阿尔及利亚问题的“根本法”草案，在国内受到了民主进步力量和一些头脑清醒的政治家的反对，这是理所当然的。但是耐人寻味的是，“根本法”草案也受到了右翼党派的攻击。这是为什么呢？因为“根本法”虽然以维护法国的殖民统治为其实质，但是殖民主义集团中的一部分人仍然担心，即使是成立这样一个有名无实的联邦机构，也可能为阿尔及利亚脱离法兰西联邦打开大门。在内阁里，国防部长、右翼激进党人摩里斯就反对“根本法”草案，甚至曾经提出辞职来表示抗议。在国民议会中，保守派议员威胁要否决内阁提出的这项法案。
    由于受到来自左右两方面的反对，组成还不多久的法国现内阁又遇到了危机。为了避免失败，布歇—莫努里多方斡旋，并把草案中的措辞改得更加含糊一些，以打消右翼党派的顾虑。他目前正不安地等待着国民议会将在9月30日休会前就这个问题举行的信任投票。法国统治集团在“根本法”问题上的争吵和内阁面临的新危机，说明了法国殖民主义在阿尔及利亚已经面临难以克服的困难。他们的败局已定，不是“根本法”或任何其他欺骗手法能够挽回得了的。
