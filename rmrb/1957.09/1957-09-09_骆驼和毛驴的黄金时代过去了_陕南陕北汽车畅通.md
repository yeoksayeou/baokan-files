Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, September 8th: Of the one hundred counties and cities in Shaanxi Province, ninety of them now have smooth automobile traffic.

At the beginning of liberation, the total mileage of highways open to traffic in Shaanxi Province was only over 1,500 kilometers, mostly distributed in the Guanzhong Plain area. Southern and northern Shaanxi, accounting for 78% of the province's area, had extremely inconvenient transportation.

In the past few years, a total of 5,600 kilometers of new and rebuilt highways have been constructed throughout the province. The old revolutionary base area of northern Shaanxi, which had only the Xianyang-Yulin Highway before liberation, has now expanded and built over 1,800 kilometers of highways, and most of the counties in this area can now be accessed by automobiles. From Fugou County in the northeast corner of Shaanxi to Dingbian County in the northwest, a distance of over 500 kilometers, camels were previously the main means of transportation, but they have now been replaced by automobiles. From Yan'an to Wuqi County, a pastoral area, it used to take at least five days to transport goods by donkey, but now it only takes half a day by automobile. In the southern mountainous areas, newly built highways are extending into the two major mountain ranges of the Qinling and Bashan Mountains that run north and south across the Hanzhong Plain. Currently, more than a dozen simple highways, totaling 1,000 kilometers, have been built in these primitive forests and steep mountains, and two highway trunk lines have also been rebuilt. The Han(zhong)-Bei(ba) and Han(zhong)-Bai(he) roads, which climb over steep mountain peaks more than 2,000 meters high, have closely connected the economic centers and material distribution centers of the southern mountainous areas.

    骆驼和毛驴的黄金时代过去了
    ——陕南陕北汽车畅通
    新华社西安8日电  陕西全省一百个县、市中，目前已经有九十个县市畅通汽车。
    解放初期，陕西省公路通车里程只有一千五百多公里，大多分布在关中平原地区；占全省面积78％的陕南和陕北，交通异常不便。
    几年来，全省新建和改建的公路共达五千六百公里。解放前只有一条咸（阳）榆（林）公路的陕北老区，现在已经拓建公路一千八百多公里，这个地区的绝大部分县已能通行汽车。从陕西东北隅的府谷县到西北部的定边县，长达五百多公里，过去以骆驼为主要运输工具，现在已经被汽车所代替。从延安到游牧区的吴旗县，用毛驴驮运货物至少要走五天，现在用汽车运输只要半天就到。在南部山区，新修的公路正向横亘在汉中平原南北秦岭和巴山两大山脉中伸延进去。现在这些遍生原始森林的丛山峻岭中，已拓建了十几条共一千公里的简易公路，还改建了两条公路干线。爬过二千多公尺高的陡峭山峰的汉（中）碑（坝）、汉（中）白（河）路等公路，已经把南部山区的经济中心、物资集散地紧密连接起来。
