Xinhua News Agency, 14th: The China Democratic League's national rectification work conference, aimed at mobilizing all league members to carry the anti-Rightist struggle through to the end, was held in Beijing on the 13th.

　　Present at the meeting were the vice-chairmen and members of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, alternate members, and heads of local organizations from twenty-four provinces and cities, totaling one hundred and one people. The meeting was presided over by Chairman Shen Junru.

　　Vice-Chairman Shi Liang delivered a report on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League Chairman Shen Junru and the Central Rectification Leading Group at the meeting. She said that the purpose of this meeting was to discuss the rectification work of the China Democratic League, mainly the work of the anti-Rightist struggle.

　　Shi Liang said that the most urgent and serious task facing us is to carry out the education of "destroying the capitalist standpoint and establishing the socialist standpoint" for our entire league, and to carry out a thorough socialist transformation of the league members and the collective of the league, and to pass the socialist test. For the League organization and the league members themselves, this is the most serious test.

　　She said that the facts revealed in the anti-Rightist struggle have proved that in the past year, the Zhang-Luo alliance and other rightists used the name of the China Democratic League and their positions inside and outside the league to carry out the criminal activities of opposing the Communist Party and opposing socialism, which made the political line and organizational line of the China Democratic League gradually right-leaning, deviating from the leadership of the Communist Party and the road of socialism. For a period of time, the China Democratic League encountered an unprecedentedly serious crisis. If the leading party had not sounded the alarm in time, and if the people of the whole country had not launched a counterattack against the bourgeois rightists, the crisis of the China Democratic League would have developed to the point of being incurable.

　　Shi Liang said that the China Democratic League is a political group mainly composed of bourgeois intellectuals. She analyzed the dual nature of bourgeois intellectuals in the stage of socialist revolution, and the resulting new political division of the three forces of the left, the middle, and the right within the China Democratic League. She said that from the stage of democratic revolution to the stage of socialist revolution, for bourgeois intellectuals and for the China Democratic League, which is mainly composed of bourgeois intellectuals, it is a process of thorough transformation, a process of shedding one's old skin and being reborn. For the China Democratic League to thoroughly transform its political stance, political line, and organizational line, to take the socialist road, and to serve socialism, it is for the China Democratic League to pass the socialist test. Similarly, league members must also accept socialist transformation and pass the socialist test. Shi Liang said that in order to realize this serious political task, it is necessary to resolutely and deeply launch the anti-Rightist struggle in the central and local leading organs, to deepen the struggle into the grassroots, to resolutely and thoroughly defeat the rightists, unite the middle, win over the majority, strengthen leadership, and improve work.

　　Shi Liang finally emphasized that in order to make the comprehensive rectification of the China Democratic League, centered on the anti-Rightist struggle, a complete victory, it is only by closely relying on the leadership of the Communist Party that it will not lose its direction in the struggle.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The Second (Enlarged) Meeting of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party – Rectification Work Conference opened in Beijing today. A total of thirty-six people attended the meeting, including members of the Central Committee, alternate members, and heads of the rectification leading groups of local organizations.

　　Chen Qiyou, chairman of the Zhi Gong Party and head of the Central Rectification Leading Group, pointed out in his opening remarks that the struggle against the rightists within the Zhi Gong Party has been going on for nearly three months and has achieved preliminary victories. The purpose of this meeting is to make everyone clear about the policies of the anti-Rightist struggle, unify understanding, and exchange experiences, so that the anti-Rightist struggle within the Zhi Gong Party can continue to develop in a deeper and more comprehensive manner.

　　Huang Dingchen, member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Zhi Gong Party and deputy head of the Central Rectification Leading Group, delivered a report on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee and the Central Rectification Leading Group, entitled "Deepen the Anti-Rightist Struggle." After analyzing that the Zhi Gong Party is a political group based on the national bourgeoisie and their intellectuals and must be transformed in order to become a political group serving socialism, Huang Dingchen listed facts and severely criticized the strong right-leaning views and sentimentalism existing within the Zhi Gong Party, such as the fallacies that there are no or very few rightists within the Zhi Gong Party, or that the rectification of the Zhi Gong Party should focus on opposing the "three evils" and should not focus on anti-Rightism, and specifically pointed out that the latter statement is extremely harmful to the anti-Rightist struggle.

　　Huang Dingchen said: "At present, not only is the exposure of rightists within the Zhi Gong Party still far from enough, but also various degrees of right-leaning views, sentimentalism, and even indifference and aloofness exist among the members and responsible personnel of the leading organs. The emergence of this kind of thinking is incompatible with the current tasks of the Zhi Gong Party. " Huang Dingchen then put forward seven suggestions on how to deepen the anti-Rightist struggle.

　　The meeting will continue.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 14th: The Rectification Work Conference convened by the Rectification Leading Group of the Headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League opened in Beijing today. Attending the meeting were all members of the Rectification Leading Group of the Headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League and heads of the rectification leading groups of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League organizations in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Dalian, and other places.

　　The meeting was presided over by Li Chunqing, head of the Rectification Leading Group of the Headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League. Li Chunqing explained the purpose and requirements of the meeting at the meeting. He pointed out that in order to deeply carry out the anti-Rightist struggle in the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League organization, it is necessary to further clarify the policies of rectification, overcome right-leaning thinking and sentimentalism.

　　At the meeting, everyone spoke enthusiastically and discussed how to deeply carry out the anti-Rightist struggle in various local organizations.

　　The meeting will continue.

　　接受社会主义改造  过好社会主义大关
　　民盟、致公党、台盟召开整风工作会议
    新华社14日讯  中国民主同盟为动员全体盟员把反右派斗争贯彻到底的全国整风工作会议，13日在北京举行。
    出席会议的有民盟中央副主席、中央委员、候补委员和二十四个省、市地方组织的负责人共一百零一人。会议由主席沈钧儒主持。
    副主席史良代表民盟中央常务委员会主席沈钧儒和中央整风领导小组在会上作了报告。她说，这次会议的目的是讨论民盟整风工作，主要的是反右派斗争的工作。
    史良说，摆在我们面前最迫切的严重任务，就是要对我们全盟进行“破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场”的教育，对盟员个人和盟的集体进行彻底的社会主义改造，过社会主义关。就盟组织和盟员个人来说，这是一次最严重的考验。
    她说，在反右派斗争中已经揭露的事实证明，过去一年中，章罗联盟和其他右派分子利用了民盟的名义和他们在盟内盟外的地位，进行了反共、反社会主义的罪恶活动，使民盟的政治路线和组织路线，逐步右倾，离开了共产党的领导和社会主义的道路。在一个时期内，民盟遭遇到了空前未有的严重危机，要不是领导党及时地敲起警钟，不是全国人民发动了对资产阶级右派分子的反击，民盟的危机将发展到无可救药的地步。
    史良说，民盟是以资产阶级知识分子为主要成分的政治团体。她分析了资产阶级知识分子在社会主义革命阶段中的两面性，和由此产生的民盟内部左、中、右三种势力的新的政治分野。她说，从民主革命阶段到社会主义革命阶段，对资产阶级知识分子和对以资产阶级知识分子为主要成分的民盟来说，是一个彻底改造的过程，是一个脱胎换骨的过程。民盟要彻底改造它的政治立场、政治路线、组织路线，走社会主义道路，为社会主义服务，就是民盟要过社会主义关。同样，盟员也要接受社会主义改造过社会主义关。史良说，要实现这一严重的政治任务，就要坚决地深入地在中央和地方领导机关展开反右派的斗争，把斗争深入到基层里去，要坚决彻底打垮右派，团结中间，争取多数，加强领导，改进工作。
    史良最后着重指出，为了使民盟以反右派斗争为中心的全面整风，取得全胜，只有紧紧依靠共产党的领导，才不至在斗争中迷失方向。
    新华社13日讯  中国致公党中央委员会第二次会议（扩大）——整风工作会议今天在北京开幕，出席这次会议的有中央委员、候补委员、各地方组织整风领导小组的负责人等共三十六人。
    致公党主席兼中央整风领导小组组长陈其尤在开幕词中指出，致公党内开展反对右派分子的斗争已经近三个月，获得了初步的胜利。这次会议是要使大家明确反右派斗争的方针政策，统一认识，交流经验，使致公党内的反右派斗争继续深入、全面地开展起来。
    致公党中央常务委员兼中央整风领导小组副组长黄鼎臣代表中央常务委员会和中央整风领导小组在会上作了“把反右派的斗争深入下去”的报告。黄鼎臣在分析了致公党是以民族资产阶级和他们的知识分子为基础的政治团体，必须经过改造才能成为为社会主义服务的政治团体之后，列举事实严厉地批判了致公党内存在着的浓厚的右倾观点和温情主义，例如说致公党内没有或很少右派分子，或者说致公党的整风应以反对“三害”为主、不应当以反右派为主等谬论，并特别提出后一种说法对反右派斗争是极为有害的。
    黄鼎臣说：“目前致公党内不仅对于右派分子的揭露还很不够，甚至在成员和领导机构的负责人员中还存在着各种不同程度的右倾观点、温情主义，甚至漠不关心、置身度外的错误思想和行动。这种思想的产生是与致公党当前的任务不相容的。黄鼎臣接着提出了关于如何把反右派斗争深入下去的七点建议。
    会议将继续举行。
    新华社14日讯  台湾民主自治同盟总部整风领导小组召开的整风工作会议，今天在北京开幕。参加这次会议的有台盟总部整风领导小组全体成员以及北京、上海、广州、旅大等地台盟组织的整风领导小组负责人。
    会议由台盟总部整风领导小组负责人李纯青主持。李纯青在会上说明了这次会议的目的和要求，他指出，为了在台盟组织中深入开展反右派斗争，必须进一步明确整风的政策方针，克服右倾思想和温情主义。
    会上，大家热烈发言，对各地方组织如何深入开展反右派斗争进行了讨论。
    会议将继续进行。
