    Wantonly Demanding the Party to Withdraw from Scientific Institutions: Peng Guangqin's Ugly Face is Exposed
    (Our Newspaper News) Peng Guangqin, the former deputy director of the South China Subtropical Crop Research Institute, who usually called himself a "pink" element, has been exposed as a rightist who has consistently opposed the Communist Party and socialism.
    Peng Guangqin is the director of the preparatory committee of the Jiusan Society Guangzhou branch. He admired Chu Anping's fallacy of "the Party's world," and said that the Communist Party is now "the Party is the state, replacing the government with the Party." When everyone was criticizing Zhang Bojun's conspiracy of a "political design institute," Peng Guangqin said that the "political design institute" was an academic issue and could be debated. Peng Guangqin tried every possible means to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party, saying that "laymen cannot lead experts," and also said that "in scientific institutions, when Party members and non-Party members serve as the top and deputy leaders, it is in fact abolishing the experts' leadership over science," demanding that the Party withdraw from scientific institutions. For the five years since the institute was established, Peng Guangqin has been opposing scientific research serving production and construction, opposing the combination of theory and practice, and opposing the organized research work with key points and plans. He said, "Scientific planning is to disperse forces and is grandiose." He also said, "Americans don't have any plans when they do research work. If the old man doesn't finish the research, the son will continue the research." Peng Guangqin also wanted to redress the grievances of the fleeing landlords and counter-revolutionaries who committed suicide for fear of punishment, protect their "legitimate rights," and tried his best to win over some people who were dissatisfied with the Communist Party. During the blooming and contending period, this "university professor," who thought he did not care about politics before liberation, suddenly became very active and analyzed the so-called internal situation of the Communist Party's organization at the Jiusan Society group meeting of the institute, studied the strategy of opening fire on the Communist Party, and arranged speeches. Peng Guangqin said: "In the past, the Communist Party did not hesitate to shed blood and sacrifice for the revolution, so today, in order to 'help' the Party, we must also follow the example of the martyrs." However, Peng Guangqin's calculation was wrong.

### 妄想要党退出科学机关  彭光钦的丑恶面目被揭穿

    妄想要党退出科学机关
    彭光钦的丑恶面目被揭穿
    本报讯　平日自称为“粉红色”分子的原华南亚热带作物科学研究所副所长彭光钦，已被揭穿，原来是个一贯反对共产党反对社会主义的右派分子。
    彭光钦是九三学社广州分会筹委会主任。他欣赏储安平的“党天下”谬论，并说现在共产党就是“党即国家，以党代政”。当大家都在批驳章伯钧的“政治设计院”的阴谋的时候，彭光钦却说“政治设计院”是学术问题，可以争鸣。彭光钦千方百计企图取消共产党的领导，说“外行不能领导内行”，又说“在科学机关党员和非党员分任正副首长，事实上就是取消专家对科学的领导”，要党退出科学机关。彭光钦在建所五年来就一直反对科学研究要为生产建设服务，反对理论与实际相结合，反对有重点有计划地组织研究工作。他说，“科学规划是分散力量，好大喜功”。又说“美国人做研究工作就没有什么计划，老子研究不完，儿子再接着研究。”彭光钦还要替畏罪自杀的逃亡地主、反革命分子申冤，保护这些人的“正当权益”，并极力拉拢一些对共产党不满分子。在鸣放期间，这个自认为在解放前不问政治的“大学教授”，突然大大活跃起来，竟在研究所九三学社小组会上分析所谓共产党组织内部情况，研究向共产党开火的策略，安排发言。彭光钦说：“过去共产党为了革命不惜流血牺牲，因而今天为了‘帮助’党，我们也要向先烈看齐。”可是，彭光钦的算盘打错了。
