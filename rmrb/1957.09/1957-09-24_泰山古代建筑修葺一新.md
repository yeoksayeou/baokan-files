    Ancient buildings on Mount Tai have been basically renovated and restored. The Bixia Temple on the summit of Mount Tai has been thoroughly renovated, and its original splendor has now been restored, with the copper bells on the corners of the eaves once again emitting pleasant tinkling sounds. The Eighteen Bends, once described as climbers seeing "the heels of those in front and the heads of those behind," is the only way to reach the South Heaven Gate and the most dangerous section of the path up Mount Tai. In the past, due to disrepair, the stone steps were incomplete. After renovation, the road has been widened, the slope has been appropriately increased, and sturdy iron railings have been installed on both sides. Famous ancient buildings such as Tiankuang Hall, Wangmu Pool, Doumu Palace, South Heaven Gate, and Jade Emperor Peak have also been renovated to look brand new.
    In order to protect the historically valuable buildings on Mount Tai, the People's Government has established the Mount Tai Renovation Committee and allocated nearly one million yuan last year to carry out comprehensive renovation work. At present, the construction work on Mount Tai is still in progress.

    泰山古代建筑修葺一新
    东岳泰山上的古代建筑，基本上已经修葺一新。泰山山巅的碧霞祠，经过彻底翻修，现在已经恢复了金碧辉煌的原貌，屋角上的铜铃又重新发出悦耳的叮当声。曾被人们描写为攀登时“后人见前人履，前人见后人顶”的十八盘，是直达南天门的必经之路，也是攀登泰山的一段最为险要的盘道。过去由于失修，石级残缺不全。经过翻修，道路已经放宽，坡度适当放大，两旁并安装了稳固的铁栏扶手。有名的天贶殿、王母池、斗母宫、南天门和玉皇顶等古建筑，也整修得焕然一新。
    人民政府为了保护泰山上有历史价值的建筑物专门设立了泰山修建委员会，去年拨款近百万元，进行全面修整工程。现在，泰山的修建工程仍在继续进行。
