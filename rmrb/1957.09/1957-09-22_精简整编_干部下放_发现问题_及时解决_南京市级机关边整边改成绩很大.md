    Nanjing Municipal机关 Achieves Great Results in Rectification and Reform While Rectifying
    (Our Dispatch) Nanjing Municipal机关, in the process of rectification, implemented the spirit of "rectification and reform while rectifying," and has achieved great results. Up to now, the municipal机关 has abolished seven offices, including those for political and legal affairs, culture and education, industry, finance, food and trade, transportation, urban construction, and the transformation of private industry and commerce, as well as four bureaus for agricultural product procurement, water conservancy, highway transportation, and shipping. It also merged four related bureaus to establish two bureaus for service and light industry, thus streamlining thirteen units. In addition, more than fifty departments have been abolished. As a result, staff sizes have been reduced. According to statistics from thirty-three units, the number of personnel has decreased from 4,832 before the reorganization to 3,921, a reduction of 18.8%. A total of 768 cadres have been transferred downward, including 41 department and bureau-level cadres, and 167 section chiefs. In seven districts, 18 cadres have been transferred downward to serve as district party secretaries and district heads. In eight state-owned factories, 343 cadres have been transferred downward.
    During this period, the work style of the cadres has improved significantly. They regularly go deep into the grassroots level to discover problems and solve them in a timely manner. The issue of workers resuming work at the Youheng Flour Mill and the issue of wages for demobilized soldiers were both resolved personally by the mayor. The Service Bureau learned that people in some areas had to queue for a long time to buy pork, so it added state-owned meat stalls in thirteen vegetable markets. In order to do a good job in the wholesale and regulation of the free vegetable market, a deputy director of the bureau and the person in charge of the vegetable company personally went to the site at 2:00 AM to direct the adjustment of buying and selling in various vegetable markets. Responsible comrades of the Port Authority, based on the opinions of the masses, led the resolution of technical problems, enabling more than 100 coal trucks that had been shelved for a long time to be used again. When a torrential rain was approaching one day, the manager of the Pharmaceutical Materials Company led cadres to the drying ground and worked with the staff to rescue more than 20,000 jin of precious medicinal material, Polygonum multiflorum. In addition, issues concerning primary school repairs and the funding of maternal and child health clinics have recently been resolved. The handling and reception of letters and visits from the people have also been improved.
    During this period, responsible comrades have participated in physical labor, and some departments have established systems for it. Cadres from the Commercial Bureau go to stores to work as salespersons, leaders of the Construction Company go to construction sites to tamp the earth, and cadres from the Public Utilities Bureau sweep the streets. Recently, due to the successive commencement of new projects in the construction sector, there was a shortage of manual laborers and a surplus of skilled workers. In order to reduce idle labor, some skilled workers were asked to temporarily act as manual laborers. Some skilled workers did not agree with this idea and sang a doggerel saying, "Skilled workers acting as manual laborers, the idea is not agreeable, work has no strength, saying is useless." After the bureau director and manager went to the construction site to do odd jobs, a new doggerel appeared: "Bureau director carries big earth, manager does odd jobs, leaders take the lead in doing it, what is there to disagree with."
    In addition, the phenomena of too many meetings, too much paperwork, and indiscriminate issuance of reports have been changed. According to statistics from the General Office of the Municipal Party Committee, the number of documents received and dispatched in the first half of this year was one-third less than in the same period last year. A preliminary clean-up of city-wide reports has been carried out, eliminating 795 unnecessary reports. At the same time, the phenomenon of extravagance and waste in机关 has begun to change. Municipal机关 has vacated more than 8,000 square meters of office space. Under the leadership of leading cadres, the People's Bank of China used various methods to solve the housing problems of more than 100 employees. 各机关 has cleared out more than 2,000 pieces of furniture, so there will be no need to add any more in the next two or three years. 机关's public miscellaneous expenses can be saved by about 610,000 yuan this year. By using cars as little as possible, more than 3,300 kilograms of gasoline have been saved in the past six months.
    Currently, each unit is continuing to counter-attack the rightists while continuing to improve its work.

    精简整编  干部下放  发现问题  及时解决
    南京市级机关边整边改成绩很大
    本报讯　南京市级机关在整风过程中贯彻“边整边改”的精神，已获很大成绩。到目前为止，市级机关已撤销了政法、文教、工业、财粮贸、交通、城市建设、对私营工商业改造等七个办公室和农产品采购、水利、公路运输、航运等四个局，并将四个有关局合并成立服务、轻工二个局，这样就精简了十三个单位；另外还裁撤了五十多个科室。这样人员编制缩减，据三十三个单位统计，已从整编前四千八百三十二人减为三千九百二十一人，缩小编制18.8％。已下放的干部共有七百六十八人；其中有部、局长干部四十一人，科长一百六十七人；有七个区已下放作区委书记、区长级干部十八人；在八个国营工厂中，则已下放干部三百四十三人。
    在这期间，干部的作风已有很大改进。他们经常深入基层，发现问题及时解决。有恒面粉厂工人复工问题，复员军人工资问题，都是由市长亲自解决的。服务局了解到有些地区群众购买猪肉时排队太长的情况，就在十三个菜场增设国营肉案；为了做好蔬菜自由市场的吞吐调剂工作，该局一副局长和蔬菜公司的负责人在夜间二点钟亲自深入现场，指挥各菜场调剂买卖。港务局负责同志根据群众意见，领导解决技术问题，使长期搁置的一百多部运煤车重新使用。药材公司经理在一天天将下暴雨的时候，带干部到晒场和职工一道抢救出二万多斤贵重药材首乌。此外，关于小学修缮，妇幼保健卫生所的经费问题，最近都得到了解决。对人民来信来访的处理接待工作也已有了改进。
    这时期来，负责同志都参加了体力劳动，有的部门已建立了制度。商业局干部下店当营业员，建筑公司领导人到工地打夯，公用事业局干部清扫马路等。建筑部门近来由于新工程相继开工，壮工不足，技工有余，为减少窝工，要求部分技工暂代壮工，有些技工思想不通，唱顺口溜说：“技工代壮工，思想搞不通，干活没力气，说也不中用”。等到局长经理等下工地干杂工后，就出现了新的顺口溜：“局长抬大土、经理当杂工，领导带头干，有啥想不通”。
    另外，会议多，文牍多，滥发报表的现象已有转变。据市委办公厅统计，今年上半年收发文件比去年同期少了三分之一，全市报表已进行了初步清理，剔除了不必要的报表七百九十五种。同时，机关中铺张浪费现象已开始转变，市级机关已让出办公用房八千多平方公尺；人民银行在领导干部带动下，用各种办法解决了一百多户职工的住房问题。各机关已清理出家具两千余件，两三年内可不再添置。机关公杂费今年年内约可节省六十一万元。由于尽量少用小汽车，半年来已节约汽油三千三百多公斤。
    现在，各单位正在一面继续反击右派，一面继续改进工作。
