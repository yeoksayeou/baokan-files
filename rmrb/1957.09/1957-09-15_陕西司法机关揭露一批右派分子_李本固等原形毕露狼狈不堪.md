Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, September 14th: In the past two months, the judicial organs of Shaanxi Province have successively exposed a group of bourgeois rightists who oppose the Communist Party's leadership in judicial work and viciously attack the national legal system.

Rightist Li Bengu, a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) and a staff member of the Lawyer and Notary Public Office of the Provincial Department of Justice, falsely accused the suppression of counter-revolutionaries as being "broad in scope and severe in punishment," and that the People's Court was "playing with people's lives." He slandered the personnel work of the judicial departments as "not asking about talent, but first asking about party affiliation," clamoring for the Communist Party members in the judicial departments to step down. He also openly advocated restoring the old judicial system's personnel management system, summoning the ghosts of the old legal personnel. Two other rightists in the Department of Justice, Wang Boyue (Communist Party member) and Yang Shaojian (RCCK member), also vehemently opposed the Party's leadership over judicial work. They slandered the Party's leadership and intervention in the work of the courts as "one of the reasons for misjudged cases" and as "interfering" with the work of the courts. Yang Yushan (Communist Party member), Deputy Director of the First Division of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Procuratorate and a rightist, falsely accused the Party's leadership of preventing the procuratorial organs from exerting their power, and attempted to abolish the Party's leadership over the procuratorial organs under the pretext that the procuratorial organs "only obey the law." Ma Haiying, Deputy Director of the Second Legal Advisory Office of Xi'an City and a rightist, falsely accused the People's Procuratorate of "stirring up trouble" and "making a fuss about nothing" in prosecuting some cases. He slandered the Procuratorate as "digging graves with hoes." Wang Lichang, Director of the People's Reception Office of the Provincial Higher People's Court and a rightist, viciously said that the Party Central Committee could lead judicial work, but the local Party committees could not lead the courts at the same level, attempting to thereby abolish the Party's leadership over judicial work.

It has been revealed that most of these rightists were old judicial personnel from before Liberation. For example, Li Bengu had successively served as a secretary in the Higher Procuratorate of Jilin Province under the Japanese puppet regime, a teacher at the Jilin Prison, the warden of Yilan County, and an acting judge in the Xi'an Local Court of the pseudo-Kuomintang before Liberation. After Liberation, he was severely criticized in the judicial reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, and therefore harbored resentment towards the Communist Party. Yang Shaojian had served as a trial officer in the Military Law Office of Chen County, Henan Province, under the pseudo-regime, and as a secretary in the Higher Court of Shaanxi Province under the pseudo-regime before Liberation. After Liberation, he had sheltered escaped landlords and feudal bullies, and also harbored dissatisfaction with the judicial reform.

Under the exposure and reasoned rebuttals of the staff of the Shaanxi Provincial Judicial Organs, these rightists have been exposed in their true colors and rendered speechless. For example, when the staff of the Provincial Department of Justice refuted Li Bengu's slanderous remarks about the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, they pointed out that the principle of the People's Court in handling cases is to send people to investigate, conduct collective research, and be very cautious, and even if mistakes occur, the principle of "correcting mistakes whenever they occur" is adhered to. Everyone questioned Li Bengu on the spot as to what basis he had for spreading these slanders. At this time, Li Bengu could not produce any facts, was utterly disgraced, and had to admit that he had fabricated and maliciously slandered. At present, some rightists have already lowered their heads and confessed their guilt.

### 陕西司法机关揭露一批右派分子  李本固等原形毕露狼狈不堪

　　陕西司法机关揭露一批右派分子
　　李本固等原形毕露狼狈不堪
    新华社西安14日电  陕西省司法机关在最近两个多月中，先后揭露出一批反对共产党领导司法工作和恶毒地攻击国家法制的资产阶级右派分子。
    右派分子、省司法厅律师公证科科员、民革成员李本固，诬蔑镇压反革命运动是“面宽刑重”，人民法院“拿人命开玩笑”；诬蔑司法部门的人事工作是“不问才不才，先问党不党”，叫嚣着要司法部门的共产党员下台；并且公然主张恢复旧司法系统管理人事的制度，向旧法人员招魂。司法厅的另外两个右派分子王伯约（共产党员）、杨绍简（民革成员）也极力反对党对司法工作的领导。他们诬蔑党对法院工作的领导和过问，是“造成案件错判的原因之一”，是“干涉”法院工作。陕西省人民检察院第一处副处长、右派分子杨玉珊（共产党员），诬蔑党的领导使检察机关不能发挥威力，并且以检察机关“只服从法律”为名，企图取消党对检察机关的领导。西安市第二法律顾问处副主任、右派分子马海瀛，诬蔑人民检察院对于一些案件的起诉是“唯恐天下不乱”，是“天下本无事，庸人自扰之”。他诬蔑检察院是“拿着镢头埋人”。省高级法院人民接待室主任、右派分子王黎昌恶毒地说，党中央可以领导司法工作，而地方党委不能领导同一级的法院工作，企图以此来取消党对司法工作的领导。
    据揭发，这些右派分子大多数是解放前的旧司法人员。例如，李本固在解放前就曾经历任日伪吉林省高等检察厅书记官、吉林监狱教诲师、依兰县典狱长和伪国民党西安地方法院代理推事等；解放后在司法改革和肃反运动中受到严格批判，因而对共产党心怀不满。杨绍简解放前曾任伪河南陈县军法处承审员、伪陕西高等法院书记官；解放后曾包庇过逃亡地主和封建把头，对司法改革也心怀不满。
    这些右派分子在陕西省司法机关工作人员的揭露和据理驳斥下，已经原形毕露、理屈词穷。例如，省司法厅的工作人员在驳斥李本固诬蔑镇压反革命运动的谰言时指出，人民法院办案的原则是派人调查，集体研究，非常慎重，即使发生错误也是坚持“有错必纠”的原则。大家当场质问李本固散播这些谰言有何根据，李本固这时举不出事实，狼狈不堪，不得不承认他自己是捏造，是恶意中伤。目前，有些右派分子已经低头认罪。
