    Flag (and one other chapter)
    Li Geng
    When the first red flag fluttered in the castle town of my hometown, I began to acquire true life. From then on, the red flag shines in my heart, like a bridge, like a pair of hands supporting me; like a carrier pigeon, like a pair of bright eyes... making me break free from the fetters of pain, the abyss of disaster, and gallop on a difficult but flat, yet fighting journey.

    Fluttering red flag! It often reminds me of my mother's fluttering temples, the fluttering red tassel on a comrade-in-arms' bugle, the fluttering trees along the edges of my motherland's towns, the white sails fluttering on the rivers.

    So I, in the days of smoke and fire, in the years of war, planted the first red flag on the high peaks and remote borders of the motherland. The red flag flies in the clouds; the red flag welcomes the breeze blowing from friendly countries.

    Red flag! How much heroism you have given me.

    Bugle Call
    When the bugle sounds, the warhorses are neighing, the bayonets are flashing with sharp light, all the sounds of steel are calmly waiting to roar towards the enemy's front line positions.

    At this time! My comrades, besides using unparalleled wisdom and courage to defeat the enemy, will not think about anything, and have not thought about anything. Not even the call of a loving mother, the advice of a lover, the most enviable song of the cuckoo, the playing of a sentimental bamboo flute, are as exciting as the bugle call.

    The bugle call is the sum of these sounds, emitting the loudest and most powerful sound.

    Now, although I no longer hear the sound of the bugle call, I often hear the call of the bugle echoing in my ears. A report, an editorial, a page of documents, a short poem, all excite me like a bugle call.

    Bugle call! My advancing life cannot be without you.

    旗（外一章）
    李耕
    当第一面红旗在我故乡的城端飘扬，我开始获得了真正的生命。从此，红旗亮在我的心底，它像桥、像一双扶携我的手；它像信鸽，像一双明亮的眼睛。……使我挣脱了苦痛的绊羁，灾难的深渊，奔驰在艰辛而又平坦但却是战斗的征途上。
    飘扬着的红旗啊！常使我想起母亲飘动着的鬓发，使我想起战友一支军号上的飘动着的红缨，使我想起祖国一个个城镇边沿上飘动着的林木，那江河上飘动着的白帆。
    于是我，在硝烟弥漫的日子里，在战火纷飞的年代，我将第一面红旗插上祖国高高的山尖，遥远的边地。红旗，在云端飘；红旗迎着从友邦飘来的微风。
    红旗啊！你给了我多少英雄气概。
    战号
    当战号吹响的时候，战马，在昂颈高嘶，刺刀，闪烁着锋利的光芒，一切钢铁的声音，在沉着地等待着向敌人前沿阵地轰鸣。
    这时候啊！我底战友，除了以无比的智勇去战胜敌人，什么也不会想，也没有想。那怕是慈母的呼唤，爱人的嘱咐，最使人羡恋的杜鹃的歌唱，多情的竹笛的吹奏，都不像战号这样激动过我。
    战号，是这些声音的总和，散发着嘹亮的最强音。
    如今，虽然我不再听见战号的声音，可是我，耳边却经常回响着战号的召唤。一次报告，一篇社论，一页文件，一首短诗，都像战号一样在激动着我。
    战号啊！我前进中的生命是少不了你的。
