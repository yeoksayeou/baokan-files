    The Petőfi Club and the Hungarian Counterrevolution
    Kish Karol, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party

    Apart from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Hungarian communists are most interested in how another great fraternal party, the Communist Party of China, develops and strengthens. The strengthening of the leadership of the 600 million Chinese people has a great impact not only on the development of the People's Republic of China but also on the development of world communism and the entire workers' movement, on the formation of the world situation, and on the growth of peace forces. Therefore, it is perfectly understandable that we pay close attention to the dangerous activities of the Chinese rightists and are happy for the fraternal Communist Party of China's resolute and effective struggle to expose the harmful anti-Party activities of the rightists.

    The Petőfi Club played a significant role in the ideological preparation for the counterrevolutionary events of October and November and in the outbreak of the events.

    The formation and actual role of the Petőfi Club can only be understood when we observe the Hungarian and international environment at that time, in which the club was composed of those gathered around Nagy Imre who called themselves the "Party opposition" but were actually hostile elements.

    As is well known, the historical June 1953 Resolution of our Party Central Committee analyzed and exposed the mistakes made by the past leadership since 1949, and pointed out the methods and ways to correct the mistakes. The majority of the Party leadership were willing to correct the mistakes quickly and thoroughly. Unfortunately, the increasingly sharp personal and power struggle between the then Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Nagy Imre, and Comrade Rakosi Magash hindered the correction of the mistakes to a great extent, and later made it almost completely impossible. In order to achieve his revisionist goals, Nagy Imre had long wanted to concentrate power in his own hands. Comrade Rakosi stubbornly insisted on his original sectarian and dogmatic mistakes and was unable to thoroughly correct the mistakes.

    In early 1955, the Central Committee removed Nagy Imre and his two partners from their positions and later expelled them from the Party.

    If this had been done entirely for the resolute implementation of the June Resolution and on the basis of the necessary ideological struggle, it would have been of great benefit to the Party. However, Comrade Rakosi implemented it in the spirit of the silent revision of the June 1953 Resolution and the victory of the sectarian and dogmatic faction. Therefore—although there were some initial improvements—the mistakes could not be thoroughly corrected, and the delay in this regard made the situation even worse.

    Comrade Kadar, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, aptly pointed out at the National Party Congress in June 1957: "The losses caused by delaying the correction of mistakes are even greater than the losses caused by the mistakes made before."

    In late February 1956, the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union were announced. As everyone knows, these resolutions were of great significance and international influence. But we can boldly say that these resolutions did not have such a profound impact on any country or party as they did in Hungary in the Hungarian Working People's Party.

    This can be easily understood from the situation described above. Because many aspects of the June 1953 Resolution of the Hungarian Working People's Party were similar to the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Party members and Party cadres increasingly demanded that the Party leadership examine their work in the spirit of the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and truly and resolutely implement the June 1953 Resolution of the Central Committee. However, the past Party leadership, whose decisive influence was exerted by sectarian conservatives, showed an inability to accomplish this task.

    Under such circumstances—on the basis of the resolutions of the 20th Congress—the healthy Marxist-Leninist seeds within the Party, which resolutely demanded to get rid of the political errors and incorrect methods of the past leadership, were increasingly strengthened. However, we wanted to correct the mistakes in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism and avoid falling into the position of the Nagy Imre group, which was known at that time not for its rebellion but for its right-wing opportunism.

    Unfortunately, however, the commander of the old leadership still hindered the majority of Party members and Party cadres from realizing the long-overdue transformation by resolutely correcting the mistakes in the spirit of the 20th Congress. This created extremely favorable conditions for the revisionist group gathered around Nagy Imre and Losonczy Géza. Since then, these people have taken advantage of the mistakes of sectarianism to portray themselves as fighters for the thorough implementation of the resolutions of the 20th Congress. This disguise won them popular support and had an increasing influence within the Party, especially among young intellectuals.

    After June 1953, especially after March 1955, a group headed by Nagy-Losonczy, mainly composed of intellectuals, writers, journalists, and university faculty and students, gradually formed. This group grossly exaggerated the mistakes and criticized the mistakes from the petty-bourgeois program of opposing the Party's worldview, and engaged in activities for bourgeois restoration behind the slogan of socialism. This group had then become an organized faction and conspired behind various open and organized forms and names (Writers' Association, Journalists' Association, Literary Gazette, etc.), and not only opposed the Party leadership, but also increasingly wantonly attacked the Party and the people's government.

    Under such circumstances, the reactionary elements who had always opposed the people's democracy also took the opportunity to rise up. They had previously been unable to find a legitimate way, but now they gladly accepted the legitimate possibility offered by the Party's opposition and made it serve their own purposes.

    The Petőfi Club was formed by Nagy Imre's revisionist faction in April 1956, with the aim of creating new and more important open discussion methods for their dark purposes.

    The goal of the Nagy faction at that time was to overthrow the entire Party leadership as the "Party opposition," to install their own people in various important positions in the Party and the state, and after seizing power in this way, to gradually realize their true goal, to abolish the people's government, and to establish some kind of democratic bourgeois system.

    Therefore, they tried every possible means to exaggerate the mistakes, hinder the correction of the mistakes, create ideological confusion, and, in short, use all methods to undermine the prestige of the Party leadership and the government.

    They not only attacked the Party and the people's state by means of slander and secret propaganda, but also openly attacked under the guise of "national communism." For example, they talked secretly about the secrets of the Party and the state, and increasingly shamelessly talked about them openly in cafes, took important political issues out into the streets, and mobilized non-Party masses against the Party leadership. With this attitude, they created opportunities for the still considerable number of remnants of the exploiting classes to participate in this "criticism," thereby attacking the Party and the government, carrying out anti-people's democratic and socialist agitation, and actively organizing activities under the shadow of the Nagy faction's opposition, preparing for the long-awaited "great opportunity."

    The intentions of the Nagy faction temporarily suited the tastes of Western imperialism as well. They knew very well that the masses could not be lured by open capitalist restoration or fascist slogans. A transitional form of so-called democratic government like Nagy's, disguised as "national communism," was exactly what they wanted. This government could be headed by pseudo-communists like Nagy in the short term, because they estimated that representatives of the old Horthy regime, who were more to their liking, could more easily and quickly take power from these people.

    The process of the 20th Congress and the influence of its resolutions were reflected most quickly and strongly among intellectuals—more precisely, among young intellectuals. They did want to expose the mistakes and shortcomings they had experienced in their political and professional activities through open and sincere discussions, and seek ways to correct them.

    Therefore, in a few months, nearly a thousand people joined the Petőfi Club. Most of them were young economists, historians, philosophers, jurists, writers, journalists, teachers, and university students; undoubtedly, most of them were promising new intellectuals from worker and peasant backgrounds, and they joined with the desire to strengthen the League, the Party, and the people's democratic system. The purpose of revisionists like Donath was completely the opposite. They accepted the commission of the Nagy-Losonczy faction to establish this club and organize hostile discussions in order to promote Nagy's anti-Party program there and establish a new personality cult around his name.

    The activities of the Petőfi Club appeared to be only to hold scientific discussions. But in fact, no discussion was conducted in the way they verbally announced, and every topic only facilitated the immediate transfer to slander against the Party, the people's government, and economic, cultural organizations and their leaders. The Nagy faction's followers recruited troops everywhere. At the first discussion meeting—the Young Economists' Discussion Meeting in April 1956—only five to six hundred people participated, but eight to nine hundred people participated in the Historians' Discussion Meeting.

    The Petőfi Club's gatherings began in an atmosphere symbolizing the enthusiastic atmosphere of Party life in 1945-48. Because the revisionists who disguised themselves as "communists" particularly skillfully used all the mistakes of the past leadership and pretended at the beginning that correcting the mistakes was their only goal. Therefore, more and more people became interested. At a discussion meeting aimed at the meeting of young intellectuals and old underground Party workers and guerrillas, 1,200 people participated. 1,600 to 1,700 people participated in the Philosophers' Discussion Meeting, and 6,000 people participated in the News Discussion Meeting.

    This rapid development certainly not only shows the extraordinary political enthusiasm of young intellectuals and students, but also is closely related to the sectarian, conservative, incompetent Party leadership and the continued suppression of Party criticism. The Petőfi Club's discussions not only became activities that did not conform to Party principles, but also completely violated Party principles and even opened the door to hostile activities at an increasing rate. They slandered and vilified the government and Party leaders there. Under such circumstances, not only revisionists but also reactionary elements in the Petőfi Club's discussions felt like a fish in water and were overjoyed.

    A serious mistake was that the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party did not recognize the harm of the discussions organized by the Petőfi Club in time, and did not take prompt and resolute measures to bring the discussions into the scope of Party principles or guide them into Party organizations. On the contrary, when the Party leadership should have taken the lead in leading everyone to realize the political transformation in the spirit of the 20th Congress, the Party itself was forced to retreat into a defensive position.

    The resolution of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party on June 30, 1956, which attempted to expose the anti-Party nature of the Petőfi Club's discussions, was too late and ineffective. Due to the lack of prior anti-revisionist ideological struggle and the reconciliation with sectarian dogmatic views, the Party members did not implement this resolution. Therefore, the gap between the Party leadership and the Party members was not narrowed in the difficult situation, but deepened.

    Because the leaders of the past sectarianism only wanted to use administrative means to oppose the Petőfi Club, Rakosi Magash even wanted to use the unfortunate Poznan incident as an excuse to suppress all criticism—including healthy criticism that conformed to Party principles. Therefore, the past leadership could not weaken the Petőfi Club with this resolution, but strengthened it instead, and thereby increased the political influence of the Nagy-Losonczy group.

    If the correct policy, the ideological struggle based on the spirit of the 20th Congress, and the method of replacing certain leaders had been adopted, it would have been easier at that time to win over the honest communist forces to recognize the revisionist and anti-Party activities of the Nagy faction and unite them around the newly formed Party leadership. Missing the opportunity to use this was an error and even a crime of the past sectarian and conservative leadership, which brought the most serious consequences.

    The Nagy faction's tactics were quite clever. They knew that the majority of their audience were firm believers in the people's government, so they appropriately concealed their true goals and intentions. For example, at the Petőfi Club's discussion meetings for economists and historians, the revisionists began only to spread their slander. Of course, some speakers took the opportunity to criticize the mistakes in economic policy, but in fact they were already opposing the state's centralized leadership and state planning, and demanding "complete decentralization." At the Historians' Discussion Meeting, some people agreed to simply call the entire history after liberation and the writings of Party history "historical forgery."

    Because the representatives of sectarian and dogmatic views were still obsessed with old mistakes at that time, inexperienced young intellectuals increasingly fell under the influence of revisionism.

    The meeting between old underground Party workers, guerrillas, and young intellectuals of the Petőfi Club had become the scene of harmful instigations by hostile elements. The appearance of this scene was also due to the fact that the past leadership did not quickly and thoroughly compensate for the losses caused by violations of socialist legality, as stipulated in the Central Committee's June 1953 resolution.

    In this way, at the later philosophy and news discussion meetings, right-wing opportunism and Nagy's newly made revisionist "national communism" ideas were able to gain practical recognition and appear in the form of "true communism." The representatives of the Nagy-Losonczy group had already regarded themselves as true victors at these discussion meetings. The "democracy" they verbally promoted seemed to have greater glory, and they simply shouted loudly at the communists, not allowing those who disagreed with their revisionist views to speak.

    For example, at the Petőfi Club's discussion meeting, Lukacs György even regarded himself as the founder of "true Marxist philosophy," but everyone knew that the right-wing opportunist views he represented in philosophy and politics had been known to the world for decades. Lukacs called the entire Marxist-Leninist philosophy thorough dogmatism and "Stalinism," which should be abandoned. Amidst the enthusiastic applause of revisionists and petty-bourgeois elements, he made the following "objective" statement: "For decades, in the main aspects, we have been active on the ideological and theoretical path that helps promote the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, while comrades basically represent a sectarian Stalinist path in the main aspects."

    Lukacs exaggerated the facts so much at the Petőfi Club that he said: "I dare say that the situation of Marxism in Hungary today is worse than in the Horthy era."

    The revisionists of the Petőfi Club revealed their true colors at the news discussion meeting. They had already openly stated there that their purpose was nothing more than a "new revolution," in other words, to subvert the people's government.

    They wanted to replace it with an imagined "complete democracy." The fact is that it is impossible to change it at all. In a Hungarian country without a tradition of parliamentary democracy, after the dictatorship of the proletariat is overthrown, it will not be bourgeois democracy, but only fascist dictatorship and bloody white terror (this has been proved by the counterrevolution in October and November and in history). Dárdos Tibor was already agitating at the news discussion meeting, saying that to learn from the example of the youth in March 1848, it is necessary and possible to achieve freedom of the press through the path of force! Openly waving the banner of the Nagy group and declaring: "The Party is us, it is this increasingly strong group of us."

    When Menai Tibor demanded to strive for "freedom of the press" for everyone, it was clear that he was fighting for the interests of the bourgeoisie. Deli Tibor believed that our country had "made mistake after mistake in the past ten years," and said: "We want to identify, is there no certain mistake in our entire ideology?" According to him, if mistakes cannot be eradicated, it can only achieve "exchanging small bad for big bad," or "using a lame donkey to pull the state cart instead of a lame horse." Therefore, in his view, "the task should be: both are abolished." He also did issue a call to the audience: "Young people, Hungarian young people, I ask you not to forget your predecessors, the youth of March. We are accustomed to calling them the youth of 1848. Comrades, I hope we can also have a youth of 1956 who will save the nation from the future."

    Is it worth our surprise that the Nagy's followers, the "Communist" writers and journalists, incited the youth of the Petőfi Club to carry out a new bourgeois revolution in this way, and that some of the youth, who were deceived by those so-called Communist writers and other intellectuals with such insidious and cunning methods, really took up arms against the people's government on October 23?

    The fact that the revisionists, the anti-Party companions within the Nagy faction, the Petőfi Club, and the Writers' Association, etc., were not conducting activities in the spirit of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, not for the consolidation of the Party and the people's government, but entirely for other purposes, for dark counterrevolutionary purposes, is not only proved by the fact that they became traitors in October and November, but also more explained by another fact. When the Party Central Committee's July 1956 resolution (Rakosi was dismissed) had already created conditions for correcting sectarian and dogmatic mistakes and realizing the spirit of the 20th Party Congress, the Nagy faction did not show the slightest willingness to approach or help the Party. After the July resolution, the activities of the revisionist group did stop for a few weeks. However, Nagy resolutely demanded to continue the hostile activities. After July, the members of the Nagy group were shocked to see that they could correct the mistakes without them. They were afraid of losing the best excuse to cover up their hostile struggle, so they immediately launched an even more rampant attack on the Party and the government.

    The leading group of the Petőfi Club also played an important role in the outbreak of the counterrevolutionary armed riots on October 23, because the student parade that gave the outbreak of the riots a possibility was organized by them.

    If we look at the path taken by the "heroes" of the Petőfi Club, then we finally find them within the Nagy-Losonczy group, which is not accidental. They and the Nagy faction have always been closely advancing on the same slope, from revisionism to betrayal.

    In this regard, I would like to give only a few examples. A writer named Sándor József, who was very closely related to the Petőfi Club, said at the meeting of the "Central Workers' Committee" (a center of the counterrevolution) in November: "I would rather have twenty times of fascism than one time of Bolshevism!" Germesh Miklós (a journalist leader of the Petőfi Club) said in the Writers' Association: "The principle of majority should be realized in the national leadership. If the vast majority of the Hungarian people demand fascism, then fascism should be implemented."

    For example, the secretary of the Petőfi Club, Donath, was not only unwilling to admit that what happened here on October 23 to November 4 was a counterrevolution, but also wanted to call this counterrevolution "national democratic revolution" long after. Regarding this, the French "Le Monde" wrote on November 10: "When the darkness of dusk accompanied the fireworks of the battle descended on Budapest, it was well known that people's democracy no longer existed."

    Chinese comrades know where this Hungarian "national communism" has fallen, how the fleeting glory of the traitor Nagy faction ended, and at the same time, they will certainly see from the newspapers those leaders of the Petőfi Club, the historian Nagy Balázs who fled to the West, the philosopher Mészáros István, the writer Ácszer Tamás, Menai Tibor, Balázs-Horváth György and many other tragic heroes well-known at the Petőfi Club's discussion meetings, how they tore off their masks. These people not only betrayed the Communist Party, socialist ideas, and their motherland, but also now provide false materials in order to please their American masters who provide them with bread, and serve all imperialist conspiracies aimed at undermining our motherland, such as the recent slanderous report of the United Nations Five-Nation Committee.

    Although later, the Hungarian people and the Hungarian communists finally learned lessons from the mistakes of sectarianism-dogmatism and revisionism-nationalism, re-established our Party, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, in the sharp struggle against right-wing and "left"-wing deviations, and consolidated the Hungarian people's government.

    In this regard, the rapid and huge moral and material support of the socialist camp and the support of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of China, and other communist parties played a great role.

    The counterrevolution in October and November was not only an extremely beneficial lesson for the Hungarian communists, but also for all the communist parties in the world. It made us realize what fatal dangers can be contained in the destruction of Party unity and the tolerance of the activities of hostile factions within the Party. At the same time, we can also see how the mistakes of sectarianism-dogmatism and revisionism-nationalism are interrelated. We should realize that only Lenin's struggle on the two fronts can defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, only by carrying out a resolute and irreconcilable struggle against conservatism, dogmatism, new revisionism and other right-wing opportunist views, only by defeating these views in open ideological struggle, only by establishing our Party's policy in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism, and only by protecting our Party's unity like protecting our eyeballs, can we smoothly strengthen the Party, win and maintain the people's government, defend peace, and build socialism.

    裴多菲俱乐部与匈牙利反革命
    匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会书记　基什·卡罗伊
    除苏联共产党而外，匈牙利共产党人最感兴趣的是另一个最伟大的兄弟党，中国共产党如何发展与加强。六亿中国人民的领导力量的加强不但对中华人民共和国的发展而且对世界共产主义及整个工人运动的发展，对世界局势的形成及和平力量的增长都有着极大的影响。因此，我们深切地注意着中国右派分子危险的活动，以及为兄弟的中国共产党所进行的揭露右派分子有害的反党活动的坚决而有效的斗争而高兴，是完全可以理解的。
    裴多菲俱乐部在10、11月反革命事件的思想准备中以及事件的爆发中扮演了相当重要的角色。
    裴多菲俱乐部的形成及其实际作用，只有当我们观察了当时那种匈牙利和国际环境以后才能理解，在那种环境中这个俱乐部是那些聚集在纳吉·伊姆雷周围以“党的反对派”自称、而实际上是敌对分子所组成的。
    众所周知，我党中央委员会具有历史意义的1953年6月决议分析并揭发了过去领导在1949年以来所犯的错误，并指出了改正错误的方法和途径。党的领导的多数愿意迅速而彻底地改正错误。遗憾的是当时的部长会议主席纳吉·伊姆雷和拉科西·马加斯同志之间日益尖锐的个人和权位斗争使得错误的改正受到极大的阻碍，乃至后来几乎完全成为不可能。纳吉·伊姆雷为了实现其修正主义的目的，早想把政权集中地掌握在自己手里。拉科西同志则顽固地坚持他原来的宗派主义和教条主义的错误，已无能彻底改正错误。
    1955年初，中央委员会撤除了纳吉·伊姆雷及其一、二伙伴的职务，后来被开除党籍。
    如果这是完全为了坚决执行6月决议，并在必要的思想斗争基础上进行的话，那么这将对党有很大的好处。然而拉科西同志却是在1953年6月决议的无声的修正和宗派主义、教条主义派系的优胜的精神上来执行的。因此——虽然有些初步的改进——错误不可能有彻底的改正，而且这方面的拖延使形势更趋恶化。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会第一书记卡达尔同志在1957年6月全国党代表会议上恰当地指出：“由于拖延错误的改正所带来的损失比以前所犯错误的损失还大”。
    1956年2月底苏共第二十次代表大会决议公布。众所周知，这些决议是具有伟大意义和国际影响的。但我们可以大胆地说，这些决议在任何一个国家或党内没有像在匈牙利在劳动人民党内产生这样深刻的影响。
    这一点从上面叙述的情况中已经容易理解。由于匈牙利劳动人民党1953年6月决议的许多方面与苏共二十次代表大会的决议相似，因此党员群众和党的干部日益坚决地要求党的领导根据苏共二十次代表大会决议的精神来检查工作，真正坚决地贯彻中央委员会1953年6月决议。但是宗派主义的保守分子起着决定影响的过去党的领导表现无能实现这一任务。
    在这种情况下——在二十次代表大会决议的基础上——坚决要求摆脱过去领导的政治上的错误和不正确的方法的党内健康的马克思列宁主义种子日益加强。然而我们是要在马克思列宁主义的精神上来改正错误，而避免陷入当时还不是以叛变而是以右倾机会主义闻名的纳吉·伊姆雷集团的境地。
    然而遗憾的是，旧的领导的指挥者在那时还阻碍着大部分党员群众和党的干部根据二十次代表大会的精神以坚决改正错误来实现早该到来的转变。这样就为聚集在纳吉·伊姆雷和罗松兹·格查周围的修正主义集团创造了异常有利的条件。自此以后，这些人利用了宗派主义的错误而把自己标榜成要为彻底实现二十次代表大会决议而斗争的战士。这一伪装使他们取得民心，并在党内，特别是在青年知识分子中产生着愈来愈大的影响。
    1953年6月，特别是1955年3月以后，以纳吉—罗松兹为首的，主要是由知识分子、作家、记者、大学师生拼凑起来的集团逐步形成。这一集团粗暴地夸大了错误，并从反对党的世界观的小资产阶级纲领出发来批评错误，躲藏在社会主义口号的后面为资产阶级复辟而活动。这一集团那时已成为有组织的派别，并在各种公开有组织的形式和名称（作家协会、记者协会、文学报等）后面阴谋策划，已不仅反对党的领导，而日益猖狂地向党和人民政权进攻。
    在这种情况下，自始至终反对人民民主的反动分子也乘机而起，他们在以前无法找到合法的方式，现在欣然应承党的反对派奉送他们的合法的可能性，并使之为自己服务。
    裴多菲俱乐部就是纳吉·伊姆雷修正主义派别分子于1956年4月组成的，旨在为自己黑暗的目的创造新的更重要的公开讨论方式。
    纳吉分子当时的目的就是以“党的反对派”来推翻整个党的领导，把自己的人马安插到党和国家的各个重要岗位，当如此夺得政权而后，逐步实现他们的真正目的，取消人民政权，建立某种民主的资产阶级制度。
    因此他们千方百计地来夸大错误，阻碍错误的改正，造成思想混乱，总之，利用一切方法破坏党的领导和政府的威信。
    他们不仅以诬蔑、密语宣传等方式来攻击党和人民国家，而且以“民族共产主义”的伪装公开进攻。例如他们密谈党和国家的机密，日益无耻地公开在咖啡馆里谈论，把机密的重要政治问题拿到大街上去，动员非党群众反对党的领导。他们以这种态度为还有相当数量的剥削阶级残余分子创造了机会来参与这种“批评”，借以攻击党和政府，进行反人民民主和社会主义的煽动，在纳吉分子反对派的阴影下积极组织活动，准备渴望已久的“大好良机”。
    纳吉分子的意图暂时也同样适合西方帝国主义的口味。他们很了解人民群众是不能以公开的资本主义复辟或法西斯口号来诱惑的。一个纳吉之类的、过渡性的、以“民族共产主义”伪装的所谓民主政府形式正中他们的心意，这个政府短期内可以由纳吉之类的伪共产主义者为首，因为他们估计，更如他们意的霍尔蒂旧制度的代表能较容易而迅速地从这些人手中把政权接受过来。
    二十次代表大会的进程及其决议的影响在知识分子中——更正确地说在青年知识分子中——反映得最为迅速而强烈。他们倒的确想通过公开、真诚的讨论来揭发他们在政治、业务活动中体会到的错误和缺点，并寻求改正的方法。
    因此他们在几个月内就有差不多一千人参加了裴多菲俱乐部。其中最多的是青年经济学者、历史学者、哲学者、法学者、作家、记者、教师、大学生；无疑的，他们之中大部分是工农出身的有为的新知识分子，他们是带着加强团、党以及人民民主制度的愿望而参加的。唐础斯·卡卜尔之类修正主义者的目的却完全相反，他们接受了纳吉—罗松兹派别分子的委托成立这个俱乐部，并组织敌对性的讨论以便在那里宣传纳吉的反党纲领，并在他的名字周围树立新的个人崇拜。
    裴多菲俱乐部的活动表面上只是举办科学性的讨论。但实际上没有一次讨论是按照他们口头上宣布的方式进行，每一个题目都只有利于立即转入对党对人民政权和经济、文化组织及其领导人的诬蔑。纳吉分子的信徒到处招兵买马，第一次讨论会——青年经济学者1956年4月讨论会——上还只有五至六百人参加，历史学者讨论会上已经有八至九百人参加。
    裴多菲俱乐部的集会开始是在象征着1945—48年党内生活的热烈情绪中进行的。因为以“共产党人”伪装自己的修正主义者特别巧妙地利用了过去领导的一切错误并在开始时摆着好像改正错误是他们的唯一目标的样子。因此愈来愈多的人感到兴趣，在以青年知识分子和老的地下党工作者、游击队员会晤为目的的一次讨论会上已有一千二百人参加，哲学者讨论会上有一千六百—一千七百人，新闻讨论会上有六千人参加。
    这一飞速的发展当然不单说明青年知识分子和学生异常的政治积极性，而且与宗派的保守的，党的领导的无能和党内批评继续受到压制的情况密切相关。裴多菲俱乐部的讨论不但成为不合乎党的原则的活动，而且在日益增长的速度中完全违反党的原则，甚至敌对的活动敞开了方便之门。他们在那里诬蔑、谩骂政府和党的领导者。在这种情况下，在裴多菲俱乐部的讨论中不但是修正主义者，而且反动分子也感到如鱼得水，欣喜若狂。
    严重的错误是匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会政治局没有及时认识到裴多菲俱乐部所组织的讨论的危害性，没有采取迅速而坚决的措施把讨论纳入合乎党的原则的范围内或引导入党的组织内进行。相反，本该党的领导起来在二十次代表大会的精神上领导大家实现政治上的转变的时候，党本身却被迫退入防御地位。
    试图揭露裴多菲俱乐部的讨论的反党性质的匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会1956年6月30日决议为时已晚而不起作用。由于事先缺乏反修正主义的思想斗争、由于对宗派的教条主义观点的和解，党员群众没有执行这一决议。因此党的领导和党员群众之间不是在困难的情况下团结起来，而是裂痕越来越深。
    由于过去宗派主义的领导者只想使用行政手段来反对裴多菲俱乐部，甚至拉科西·马加斯要利用不幸的波兹南事件作为借口来压制一切批评——包括健康的合乎党的原则的批评在内。因此过去的领导不能以此决议来削弱，反而加强了裴多菲俱乐部，并从而增加了纳吉—罗松兹集团的政治影响。
    如果以正确的政策，基于二十次代表大会精神的思想斗争及撤换某些领导者的方法，当时还能较容易地争取正直的共产党员力量认识纳吉分子的修正主义和反党活动，使他们团结在新组成的党的领导周围。错过了这一可能性的利用乃是过去宗派的、保守的领导的一个错误乃至罪恶，它带来了最严重的后果。
    纳吉分子的策略相当巧妙，他们知道他们的听众的大多数是人民政权的坚定信徒，因此他们适当地掩盖了他们的真正目的和意图。例如在裴多菲俱乐部经济学者和历史学者讨论会上，修正主义者开始只展开了他们的诽谤。当然，某些发言人借口批评经济政策上的错误，实际上早在那里反对经济的国家集中领导和国家计划，要求“完全分散”。历史学者讨论会上则有人同意把整个解放后的历史和党史的著作简单地称之谓“历史的伪造”。
    由于宗派主义、教条主义观点的代表者那时还执迷于旧的错误，因此没有经验的青年知识分子愈来愈陷入了修正主义的影响下。
    老的地下党工作者、游击队员和裴多菲俱乐部青年知识分子的会晤已经变成了敌对分子有害的煽惑的现场。这一场面的出现，也是由于过去领导没有像1953年6月中央委员会决议所规定的那样迅速而彻底地来弥补违反社会主义法制的损失。
    就这样，在后来的哲学和新闻讨论会上，右倾机会主义，纳吉之类新制的修正主义“民族共产主义”思想有可能得到实际的公认，并以“真共产主义”的姿态出现。纳吉——罗松兹集团的代表者在这些讨论会上已经以真正的胜利者自居，他们口头上所宣传的“民主”似有更大的荣誉，他们简单地大声吆喝共产党人，不准不同意他们修正主义观点的人开口。
    例如，在裴多菲俱乐部讨论会上，鲁卡奇·吉尔捷却以“真正的马克思主义哲学”的始祖自居，殊不知他在哲学、政治中所代表的右倾机会主义观点几十年来举世皆知。鲁卡奇把整个马克思列宁主义哲学称之谓道地的教条主义，“斯大林主义”，应该抛弃，在修正主义和小资产阶级分子的热烈掌声中他作了如下的“客观的”声明：“几十年来在主要方面我们一直是在那种有助于促进苏共第二十次代表大会的思想理论路线上活动的，而同志们基本上在主要方面却代表了一种宗派的斯大林主义路线”。
    鲁卡奇在裴多菲俱乐部竟如此夸大事实，他说：“我敢说，今天匈牙利的马克思主义情况比霍尔蒂时代还要坏”。
    裴多菲俱乐部的修正主义者在新闻讨论会上露出了他们真正的马脚，他们在那里已经露骨地表明了他们的目的无非是“新的革命”，换句话说就是颠复人民政权。
    他们要代之以一个想像中的“完全民主”，事实是丝毫也无法改变的，在一个没有议会民主传统的匈牙利国家，无产阶级专政被推翻后，不会是资产阶级民主，而只能是法西斯专政，血腥的白色恐怖（10、11月反革命期间及历史上均证明了这一点）。道尔多斯·蒂波尔在新闻讨论会上已经在煽动说，要学习1848年3月青年的榜样，就需要而可能通过强力的道路实现新闻自由！公开地打起纳吉集团的旗帜宣称：“党就是我们，就是我们这个日益壮大的集团。”
    当梅奈伊·蒂波尔要求为每一个人争取“新闻自由”的时候，显然他是为了资产阶级的目的而斗争了。德利·蒂波尔认为我国“近十年来错上加错”，他说：“我们要来鉴别一下，在我们整个思想体系中难道就没有一定的错误吗。”据他看来，如错误不能得到根除，只能达到“以小坏换大坏”，或“以跛驴代跛马来拉国车。”因此按他的看法“任务应该是：二者皆废”。他也确实向听众发出了号召：“青年们，匈牙利青年们，我要求你们别忘记前辈，3月的青年。我们习惯于称呼他们为1848年的青年。同志们，我希望我们也可以有一个拯救民族于未来的1956年的青年”。
    纳吉的信徒们“共产党员”作家和记者就是如此煽动裴多菲俱乐部的青年起来进行新的资产阶级的革命，一部分受到那些被认为是共产党作家和其他知识分子以如此阴险狡诈手法欺骗的青年在10月23日真的拿起武器来反对人民政权，值得我们奇怪吗？
    纳吉分子，裴多菲俱乐部和作家协会等内部的修正主义者，反党的同伴们不是本着苏共第二十次代表大会的精神，不是为了党和人民政权的巩固，而是完全为了别的目的，为了黑暗的反革命目的进行活动的，这一点不仅为10、11月间他们变成叛徒这一事实所证明，而且另一事实更能说明这一点，当党中央委员会以1956年7月决议（拉科西撤职）已经为改正宗派主义、教条主义的错误，实现二十次党代表大会的精神创造了条件，那时纳吉分子并未表示丝毫愿意靠近或帮助党的迹象。7月决议后，修正主义集团的活动也的确停止过几个星期。但是，纳吉坚决要求继续进行敌对活动。7月后，纳吉集团的成员看到没有他们也能改正错误的情景大吃一惊，他们深怕失掉掩盖他们敌对斗争的最好的借口，因此他们顿时向党和政府发动了更加猖狂的进攻。
    裴多菲俱乐部的领导集团在10月23日反革命武装暴乱的爆发中也扮演了重要的角色，因为给予暴乱的爆发以可能性的学生游行就是他们组织的。
    如果我们来看一看裴多菲俱乐部的“英雄”们所走的道路，那么我们终于在纳吉—罗松兹集团内找到了他们并不是偶然的。他们和纳吉分子始终紧密地在同一个斜坡上前进，从修正主义直到叛变。
    在这一方面我只想举几个例子。一个名叫山道尔·约瑟夫的作家，他与裴多菲俱乐部的关系很密切，11月他在“中央工人委员会”（反革命的一个中心）会议上说：“宁愿要二十次法西斯主义亦不愿意要一次布尔什维克主义！”格麦斯·米克罗斯（裴多菲俱乐部的一个记者头目）在作家协会说：“在国家领导中应该实现多数原则，如果匈牙利人民的绝大多数要求法西斯主义，那么就应该来搞个法西斯主义。”
    又如裴多菲俱乐部的书记唐础斯·卡卜尔，不但在10月23日到11月4日之间不愿意承认我们这里发生的是反革命，就是在很久以后他还想把这个反革命说成是：“民族民主革命”，关于这一点法国“世界报”已于11月10日就这样写过：“当黄昏的阴暗伴随着战斗的烟火降临布达佩斯时，人民民主之不复存在乃尽人皆知”。
    中国同志们知道，匈牙利这个“民族共产主义”曾倒向何处，叛徒纳吉分子昙花一现的荣耀曾如何结局，同时亦一定会从报上看到那些裴多菲俱乐部的头目们，流亡西方的历史学者纳吉·巴拉兹，哲学者梅沙拉斯·伊斯特万，作家阿采尔·托马什，梅奈伊·蒂波尔，巴洛兹—霍瓦特·吉尔捷和裴多菲俱乐部讨论会上知名的许多其他悲惨的好汉们是如何地撕下了他们的假面具。这些人不但出卖了共产党、社会主义思想和他们的祖国，而且现在还在为了讨好于供给他们面包的美国主子，提供虚假的材料，为一切旨在破坏我们祖国的帝国主义阴谋，如最近联合国五国委员会污蔑性的报告而服务。
    虽然晚了一些，但匈牙利人民和匈牙利共产党人终于从宗派主义—教条主义和修正主义—民族主义的错误中吸取了教训，在反对右倾和“左”倾偏向的尖锐斗争中重新建立了我们的党，匈牙利社会主义工人党，并巩固了匈牙利人民政权。
    在这方面，社会主义阵营迅速而巨大的道义上和物质上的支援及苏共、中共和其他共产党的支持起着莫大的帮助作用。
    10、11月反革命不仅对匈牙利共产党人，而且对全世界所有的共产党都是一次极其有益的教训。它使我们认清：党的团结的破坏，对党内敌对派别活动的容忍会蕴藏着如何致命的危险。同时也可看到：宗派主义—教条主义和修正主义—民族主义的错误之间存在着如何相互影响的关系。我们应该认识到：只有列宁的两条战线的斗争才能保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，只有对保守主义、教条主义、新型的修正主义及其他右倾机会主义观点进行坚决的不调和的斗争，只有在公开的思想斗争中战胜这些观点，在马克思列宁主义精神上建立我们党的政策，像保卫我们的眼珠一样来保卫我们党的团结，才能顺利地加强党，赢得并保持人民政权，保卫和平和建设社会主义。
