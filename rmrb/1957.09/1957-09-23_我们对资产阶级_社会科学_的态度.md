    Our Attitude Towards Bourgeois "Social Science"
    Yu Guangyuan
    Guo Moruo's speech at the symposium held by the Chinese Academy of Sciences on September 18th thoroughly analyzed the anti-socialist scientific program of the Zhang-Luo alliance regarding social sciences and profoundly exposed the anti-Party and anti-socialist nature of the bourgeois rightists' activities in "restoring" bourgeois sociology, economics, etc. It is a further elaboration of Guo Moruo's speech "Refuting an Anti-Socialist Scientific Program" at the Fourth Session of the National People's Congress.
    Currently, the struggle against rightists in the field of philosophy and social sciences is deepening and developing. The significance of this struggle is extremely important, and we should have sufficient estimation of it. This is an extremely important front in the counterattack against the rightists' anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. The characteristic of the struggle on this front is to directly defend the theoretical foundation of the Chinese Communist Party—Marxism-Leninism. Marxism-Leninism is the scientific expression of the interests of the world proletariat, the sharp ideological weapon for the proletariat and the broad masses of working people to get rid of the status of being exploited and oppressed, to strive for liberation, and to build socialism and communism after achieving revolutionary victory. Under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, our people have achieved the great victory of the democratic revolution and the great victory of the socialist revolution. Under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, our great socialist construction is proceeding smoothly. At present, in our country, although the socialist transformation has been basically completed in terms of ownership, the class struggle has not ended. The political struggle and ideological struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie are still long-term, tortuous, and sometimes even very fierce. To win a complete victory in this class struggle, we must have a science that guides the proletariat in carrying out class struggle. At the same time, in order to solve the new subject of correctly handling contradictions among the people, we must also correctly apply and strive to develop Marxism-Leninism. Marxism-Leninism has been recognized as the theoretical basis guiding our thinking in China today. The bourgeois rightists harbor deep hostility towards this status of Marxism-Leninism. They understand that to oppose the Communist Party and oppose socialism, they must carry out a war of attrition, and overthrow the banner of Marxism-Leninism. In fact, they did just that. They carried out a series of sinful activities in this regard. They opposed ideological remolding and used double-dealing tactics to hide their political and ideological faces. They spent a long time brewing how to achieve the restoration of bourgeois "social science" and usurp the leading position of Marxism-Leninism in our country, and conspired to plan specific strategies and steps. And when they thought the time had come, they actively launched activities, uglifying Marxism-Leninism and beautifying bourgeois "social science" on various occasions. Finally, the bourgeois rightists concisely recorded their ideas in the anti-socialist scientific program of the Zhang-Luo alliance, and carried out many specific propaganda and organizational activities in sociology, economics, law, and political science in accordance with the spirit of this program. We must hold high the banner of Marxist-Leninist truth and wage a life-and-death struggle with the rightists in the field of social science.
    Now I would like to discuss what attitude we should take towards bourgeois "social science," and discuss the fundamental differences between us and the bourgeois rightists on this issue. Here we can look at the second section of the chapter "On Social Science Issues" in the anti-socialist scientific program. This section contains few words, but its content is very important. This section states at the outset: "To develop social science, we must first change our attitude towards the old social science." Analyzing this sentence, it contains three points: First, they affirm that the so-called "social science" of the bourgeoisie is true science. In this way, they erected a banner of bourgeois "social science" that opposes Marxism-Leninism. Second, they affirm that the attitude of the Communist Party and the government towards bourgeois "social science" since liberation has been wrong. Specifically, it is: "Some people believe that there is no social science in bourgeois society, because those things that were called 'social science' in the past are unscientific. Social science in socialist society must be created from scratch, with nothing to inherit. One can only criticize bourgeois social science; there is no question of accepting it. It is not a matter of transforming the old social science, but of abolishing it." Third, it is affirmed that what should be emphasized in our country is the so-called "social science" of the bourgeoisie, not the social science of Marxism-Leninism. Although this sentence is not explicitly stated, it is very obvious from the spirit of the entire sentence, otherwise it is impossible to understand why "to develop social science, we must first (please note it is first, not second) change our attitude towards the old social science (please note it is old social science, not Marxist-Leninist social science)." The requirement they put forward is that "the attitude towards the old social science should be transformation rather than abolition. Therefore, what should be restored should be restored by taking appropriate steps immediately, and what should be valued should be valued."
    We absolutely cannot accept these views of the bourgeois rightists.
    Whether the so-called "social science" of the bourgeoisie can be said to be true science has long been concluded by history. When the bourgeoisie played a revolutionary role in history, it made certain contributions to the study of social phenomena. Leaving philosophy aside for the moment, in terms of political economy, socialist theory, and history, advanced bourgeois scholars have created various theories and raised various questions. However, due to the limitations of their narrow interests as an exploiting class, it was impossible to establish a true social science. True social science was established by Marx and Engels. They stood on the position of the most advanced class of mankind, the proletariat, used the viewpoint and method of dialectical materialism, and made a concrete and in-depth analysis of capitalist society, especially its economic system. Especially after writing works such as "Capital," a great change in the history of human thought was realized, and the study of society was transformed into true science. Engels' "Speech at the Grave of Marx" and Lenin's "What is to be Done?" both compared Marx's role in social science with Darwin's role in biology. Engels said: Just as Darwin discovered the laws of the biological world, Marx discovered the laws of the development of human history; Lenin said more clearly: Just as Darwin was the first to place biology on a completely scientific basis, Marx was the first to place sociology on a scientific basis. After Marxism was established, on the one hand, progressive thinkers no longer had to grope in the dark, because there was already the guiding light of Marxism. All advanced scholars who truly pursued the truth no longer stood on the bourgeois position to study knowledge, while those who insisted on the bourgeois social and political views were only those second- and third-rate figures in the academic circles who voluntarily acted as "compradors" of the capitalists. On the other hand, because the bourgeoisie became increasingly reactionary, their so-called "social science" did not hesitate to manufacture lies in order to serve the purpose of maintaining the capitalist exploitation system. Therefore, modern reactionary bourgeois "social science" is not only unscientific, but also anti-scientific. Strictly speaking, bourgeois "social science" simply does not exist. To judge whether a subject is a true science, one must first see whether it has grasped the objective laws. Bourgeois social science has not and cannot grasp the objective laws of social development. Therefore, it is not a true science. These were originally common sense known to middle school students, but now right-wing scholars ignore the facts and insist on calling the lies of the bourgeoisie social science, so we have to repeat these well-known truths here.
    Since Marxism spread to China, Chinese Marxists have carried out a long-term struggle against bourgeois theories in various fields of social science. This struggle has promoted the development of Marxist social science in China and weakened the influence of bourgeois "social science." However, before liberation, universities and research institutions were controlled by reactionaries, and the dominant position there was of course bourgeois "social science." After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party and the government carried out fundamental reforms of education and science. In this socialist reform, the handling of various issues related to the so-called "social science" of the bourgeoisie was based on the above-mentioned principled negation of this basic attitude. Some courses that should not have been offered were stopped, some departments that should not have been established were closed, and some "research work" that should not have been carried out was stopped. It was absolutely necessary for us to take such an attitude, because without this, we could not make our education and scientific undertakings serve the purpose of socialist construction, and we could not prevent young people from being poisoned by reactionary ideas. Our attitude is firm on such fundamental issues, and we will not be shaken in the slightest because intellectuals who adhere to the bourgeois position "have been emotionally affected to a certain extent," or because they express dissatisfaction with the status of bourgeois "social science" in New China. But it must also be pointed out that the steps we have taken are cautious. We began to solve this problem in 1949. In 1950, we proposed curriculum reform. After two or three years of research and discussion, we finally implemented the adjustment of departments in 1952. At the same time, we made arrangements for the work of people who had studied the so-called "social science" of the bourgeoisie in the past, and helped some people change careers so that they could learn knowledge that was useful for socialist construction. May I ask what is incorrect about the attitude of the Communist Party and the government in handling this issue? The rightists have wantonly slandered curriculum reform and the adjustment of departments. Their purpose is to use universities as strongholds for them to gather reactionary forces, cultivate their successors, incite young people, and call for the restoration of capitalism. Can we allow them to engage in such sinful activities?
    There are two issues that must be explained regarding the attitude towards bourgeois "social science." One is the issue of cultural heritage, and the other is the issue of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend." When the anti-socialist scientific program of the Zhang-Luo alliance talked about the attitude towards bourgeois "social science," it deliberately used many terms such as "bourgeois social science," "old social science," "social science in bourgeois society," "research on social science in capitalist countries," and "social science" without any adjectives, making the concepts so confused. It has a malicious purpose. On the one hand, they pretend to be protectors of cultural heritage, and on the other hand, they wantonly attack and portray us as barbarians who reject any heritage and want to "create from scratch," and portray us as sectarianists who exclude all dissidents. Is there even a trace of basis for this attack by the rightists? They are so absurd as to say that we "believe that there is no social science in bourgeois society, because those things that were called 'social science' in the past are unscientific," and that we believe that "social science in socialist society must be created from scratch, with nothing to inherit," and so on. This is utter nonsense. Everyone knows that Marxism is also a social science formed in capitalist society. Do we say it is "unscientific"? It is unimaginable not to inherit "social science in capitalist society" in socialist society. We Marxists value historical heritage most and truly inherit historical heritage. Lenin said it well: "The history of philosophy and the history of social science have clearly shown that Marx has nothing resembling 'sectarianism.' It is by no means a narrow-minded and stubborn doctrine that arose from the development path of world civilization. On the contrary, all of Marx's genius lies in the fact that he answered the various questions that have been raised by advanced human thought. His doctrine is a direct inheritance of the doctrines of those great philosophers, political economists, and socialists." In addition to German classical philosophy, British political economy, and French socialism, which are the three sources of Marxism, we can also see in Plekhanov's works the Marxist's admiration for French historians in the Restoration era. Even the rural surveys conducted and political commentaries published by bourgeois scholars were given a good evaluation by Lenin in his article "What Heritage Do We Reject?" However, Marxists firmly reject the reactionary philosophy and reactionary "social science" of the modern bourgeoisie. Right-wing philosophers and social scientists believe that this attitude is our rejection of excellent cultural heritage. To this accusation, we can learn Lenin's method of asking questions in the above-mentioned article and ask them: Why can't we say instead that this rejection shows that we advocate cleaning these reactionary and anti-scientific things out of the excellent traditions of human history?
    Of course, our principled negation of the so-called "social science" of the bourgeoisie does not mean that we completely ignore them. Bourgeois reactionary philosophy and reactionary so-called "social science" occupy a dominant position in capitalist countries in Europe and the United States today. They play a great role in these countries. It also constantly affects our country. At the same time, after the bourgeois "social science" of Europe and the United States was introduced into China, it has been around for decades, and Chinese bourgeois scholars have also made their own contributions in this regard. Therefore, if we do not allow these erroneous ideas to be expressed and do not study their erroneous academic viewpoints, we cannot effectively refute them, and therefore we cannot eliminate their influence among intellectuals and among the people. At the same time, not all of the works of bourgeois reactionary philosophy and "social science" are without material that is useful to us. In order to study social phenomena in capitalist countries, we must use the works of these "scholars." In Lenin's words, without using the works of these educated assistants of the bourgeoisie, our research on capitalist countries "cannot move forward." The problem is that when we use these works, we must recognize and criticize their reactionary tendencies, and we must not allow slavish adherence to bourgeois philosophy and "social science," and we must not allow the propaganda of bourgeois reactionary ideas under the pretext that some useful materials in the works of bourgeois scholars can be used. "Let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" is a policy to promote the development of art and the progress of science. According to this policy, some courses introducing and criticizing idealist philosophy and bourgeois "social science" (such as Keynesian economics) were opened in some universities last year, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences also began to arrange research work for gentlemen who had studied bourgeois "social science" in the past. This policy must continue to be implemented. But right-wing elements must never be allowed to use this policy to carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, using this as an excuse to attempt the restoration of bourgeois social science and usurp the leading position of Marxism-Leninism in our country.
    Our attitude towards bourgeois "social science" is completely correct and does not need to be changed. The bourgeois rightists expressed such indignation and carried out such vicious attacks on our attitude towards the "old social science" since liberation, the purpose of which is to create public opinion for bourgeois "social science." In addition to openly proposing to "value" and "restore" bourgeois "social science," the bourgeois rightists also put forward another requirement in the anti-socialist scientific program, that is: they advocated that "the old social science" should be "transformed" and opposed taking a principled negative attitude. This statement has confused some people. But since modern bourgeois "social science" is fundamentally anti-scientific and reactionary, how can it be transformed? The rightists answered this question with action. Didn't they propose to "establish" "proletarian sociology"? Didn't they propose to absorb some of Keynes' principles to enrich and develop Marxist political economy? Isn't the so-called "transformation" of the right-wing elements to build and repair the bourgeois "social science" on the foundation and beautify it, put on a Marxist-Leninist coat, so as to fish in troubled waters and deceive young people? In the eyes of the rightists, this is a less resistant way out for the restoration of bourgeois "social science." We must expose this despicable and sinister trick of the bourgeois rightists.
    In order to build our country into a socialist society, there is no doubt that we must develop Marxist-Leninist social science. Some disciplines with less class nature, such as linguistics and archeology, must also be carried out under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism. This is our firm and unwavering policy. To develop social science, what we must do at present is not "to first change our attitude towards the old social science," but to further deepen the struggle against the rightists in the field of social science, completely smash the right-wing elements' conspiracy to restore bourgeois "social science," and refute all kinds of anti-communist and anti-socialist absurd remarks about social science. This is an acute political struggle. In order to win this struggle, we must also carry out a period of work in the capital and other places. But the struggle in the field of social science cannot end here. In a considerable period of time in the future, we must also launch a large-scale ideological debate in the academic circles, and thoroughly liquidate the bourgeois "social science," especially bourgeois sociology, economics, law, and political science, which have had an impact on the academic circles in our country. We believe that through this great debate on the social science front, the influence of bourgeois "social science" among intellectuals in our country will be greatly weakened, the theoretical team of Marxism-Leninism will be strengthened, and the content of socialist education for the broad masses of intellectuals and the people will be enriched because it has increased this aspect of vivid combat materials. Let us hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and fight for the development of social science in our country!

    我们对资产阶级“社会科学”的态度
    于光远
    9月18日郭沫若院长在中国科学院召开的座谈会上的讲话，对章罗联盟反社会主义科学纲领关于社会科学的部分作了透彻的分析，并对资产阶级右派在“恢复”资产阶级社会学、经济学等方面的活动的反党反社会主义的性质作了深刻的揭发。它是郭沫若院长在全国人民代表大会第四次会议上的发言“驳斥一个反社会主义的科学纲领”进一步的发挥。
    目前哲学社会科学界反右派斗争正在深入和发展。这一斗争的意义十分重大，对此我们应该有足够的估计。这是反击右派反党反社会主义活动的一个极其重要的战线。这条战线上斗争的特点是直接捍卫中国共产党的理论基础——马克思列宁主义。马克思列宁主义是全世界无产阶级利益的科学表现，是无产阶级和广大劳动群众摆脱被剥削被压迫的地位，争取解放，并在取得革命胜利之后建设社会主义和共产主义的锐利的思想武器。在马克思列宁主义的指导下，我国人民取得了民主革命的伟大胜利，又取得了社会主义革命的伟大胜利。在马克思列宁主义指导下，我国伟大的社会主义建设正在顺利进行。目前在我国，虽然社会主义改造在所有制方面说来已经基本完成，但是阶级斗争并没有结束，无产阶级同资产阶级间的政治斗争和意识形态方面的斗争还是长期的、曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。为要在这个阶级斗争中取得彻底胜利就一定要有指导无产阶级进行阶级斗争的科学。同时，为了解决正确处理人民内部矛盾的新课题，也一定要正确运用并努力发展马克思列宁主义。马克思列宁主义在今天中国已被公认为指导我们思想的理论基础。资产阶级右派对马克思列宁主义的这个地位是怀着深刻敌意的，他们懂得要反对共产党、反对社会主义就一定要进行挖心战，打倒马克思列宁主义这面旗帜。事实上他们也就这样做了。他们在这方面进行了一系列的罪恶活动。他们反对思想改造，用两面派手法把自己的政治和思想面目隐藏起来。他们长时期酝酿如何达到资产阶级“社会科学”复辟、篡夺马克思列宁主义在我国的领导地位的目的，并阴谋筹划具体的策略和步骤。而当他们以为时机到来的时候，就积极展开了活动，在各种场合丑化马克思列宁主义和给资产阶级“社会科学”擦脂抹粉。最后，资产阶级右派把他们这一方面的思想简明扼要地记载到章罗联盟反社会主义的科学纲领中去，而且在社会学、经济学、法学、政治学等方面按照这个纲领的精神进行了许多具体的宣传和组织活动。我们一定要把马克思列宁主义真理的旗帜高高举起，在社会科学领域内同右派作一场你死我活的斗争。
    现在我想讨论一下我们究竟对资产阶级“社会科学”采取什么态度，讨论一下在这个问题上我们同资产阶级右派的根本分歧。在这里我们可以来看看反社会主义科学纲领“关于社会科学问题”这一章的第二节。这一节用字不多，但内容十分重要。这一节开宗明义写道：“要发展社会科学，首先要改变对待旧社会科学的态度”。这句话分析起来就包含这样三点意思：第一，他们肯定资产阶级所谓“社会科学”是真正的科学。这样他们就树立起一面同马克思列宁主义相对抗的资产阶级“社会科学”的旗帜。第二，肯定解放以来，共产党和政府对待资产阶级“社会科学”的态度是错误的。具体说来就是：“有人认为资产阶级社会里没有社会科学可言，因为那些过去被称为“社会科学”的东西都是不科学的。社会主义社会里的社会科学要从头创造，没有可继承的。对于资产阶级社会科学只有批判，谈不到接受。对旧社会科学不是改造，而是取消。”第三，肯定在我国应该着重发展的是资产阶级所谓“社会科学”，不是马克思列宁主义的社会科学。这一句话虽然没有明说，但是从整句话的精神来看，就很明显，否则不能理解为什么“要发展社会科学，首先（请注意是首先不是其次）要改变对待旧社会科学（请注意是旧社会科学不是马克思列宁主义的社会科学）的态度”。他们提出的要求就是“对待旧社会科学应当是改造而不是取消，因此应当恢复的应即采取适当步骤予以恢复，应当重视的就应重视起来。”
    资产阶级右派的这些观点是我们绝对不能接受的。
    资产阶级所谓“社会科学”究竟能不能说是真正的科学，历史早就有了结论。当资产阶级在历史上还起着革命作用的时期，资产阶级在对社会现象的研究方面是有过一定贡献的。把哲学暂且撇开不说，在政治经济学方面，在社会主义理论方面，在历史学方面资产阶级的先进学者曾经创立了各种学说，提出了种种问题。但是由于他们剥削阶级狭隘利益的限制，不可能建立真正的社会科学，真正的社会科学是由马克思和恩格斯建立的。他们站在人类最先进的阶级，无产阶级立场上，运用辩证唯物主义的观点和方法，并对资本主义社会，特别是它的经济制度，作了具体的深入的分析，特别是写出资本论这样的著作之后，才实现了人类思想史上的伟大的变革，使人们对社会的研究变为真正的科学。恩格斯“马克思墓前演说”和列宁“什么是‘人民之友’”中，都把马克思在社会科学上的作用同达尔文在生物学上的作用相比。恩格斯说：正如达尔文发现生物界的规律一样，马克思发现了人类历史的发展规律；列宁说得更明白：正如达尔文第一次把生物学放置到完全是科学的基础上来一样，马克思第一次把社会学放置到科学的基础上来。到了马克思主义建立起来之后，一方面由于进步的思想家可以不必再暗中摸索，由于已经有了马克思主义这盏指路明灯，一切真正追求真理的先进的学者不再站在资产阶级立场上研究学问，而坚持资产阶级社会政治观点的人，只是那些自愿当资本家的“帮办”的学术界二三流的角色。另方面由于资产阶级日益反动，他们的所谓“社会科学”便更不惜制造谎言，达到服务于维护资本主义剥削制度的目的。因此现代反动的资产阶级“社会科学”不但是不科学的，而且是反科学的。严格说来资产阶级“社会科学”是根本不存在的。判断一门学问是否是真正的科学，首先要看是否掌握到客观的规律。资产阶级社会科学是没有、而且也不可能掌握到客观的社会发展的规律。因此不是真正的科学。这些本来都已成为中学生都知道的常识，但是现在右派的学者们却不顾事实，硬把资产阶级的谎言称之为社会科学，因此我们就不得不在这里重复这些早已众所周知的真理。
    自从马克思主义传播到中国之后，中国的马克思主义者在社会科学的各个领域同资产阶级学说进行了长期的斗争。这个斗争推动马克思主义社会科学在中国的发展，削弱了资产阶级“社会科学”的影响。但是在解放以前大学和研究机关掌握在反动派手里，在那里占统治地位的当然是资产阶级“社会科学”。中华人民共和国成立之后，中国共产党和政府对教育和科学事业进行了根本的改革。在这个社会主义的改革中对有关资产阶级所谓“社会科学”的各种问题的处理，就是从上面所说的原则上否定这个基本态度出发的。某些不应该开的课程停开了，某些不应该设立的系停办了，某些不应该进行的“研究工作”停止了。我们采取这样的态度是完全必要的，因为不如此，就不能使我们的教育和科学事业服务于社会主义建设的目的，就不能防止青年遭受反动思想的毒害。对待这样带根本性质的问题，我们的态度是坚定的，不会因为坚持资产阶级立场的知识分子“在情绪上受到了一定的影响”，或者由于他们对资产阶级“社会科学”在新中国地位表示不满而发生任何动摇。但是也必须指出我们采取的步骤是慎重的。1949年我们就着手解决这个问题，到1950年我们提出课程改革，中间经过二、三年时间的研究讨论，到1952年才最后实施院系调整。同时我们对过去研究资产阶级所谓“社会科学”的人的工作都作了安排，帮助有些人转业，使他们学到对社会主义建设有用的知识。请问共产党和政府这样处理问题的态度有哪些不正确的地方？右派对课程改革、院系调整，横加诋毁。其目的就是要把高等学校当作他们集结反动力量，培养他们的接班人，煽惑青年，号召资本主义复辟的据点。我们能够允许他们干这样的罪恶勾当吗？
    在对待资产阶级“社会科学”的态度上有两个问题是必须说明的。一是对待文化遗产的问题，一是百家争鸣的问题。章罗联盟反社会主义科学纲领在谈到对资产阶级“社会科学”的态度的时候，故意用了“资产阶级社会科学”，“旧社会科学”，“资产阶级社会里的社会科学”，“研究资本主义国家社会科学”，以及不加任何形容词的“社会科学”这许许多多的名词，把概念弄得这样混乱不堪，是有它恶毒目的的。他们一方面把自己装做文化遗产的保护者，另一方面又肆意攻击，把我们描写成拒绝任何遗产，一切要“从头创造”的野蛮人，把我们描写成排斥一切异己的宗派主义者。右派的这种攻击有一丝一毫的根据吗？他们竟荒谬到这样的程度，说什么我们“认为资产阶级社会里没有社会科学可言，因为那里过去被称为‘社会科学’的东西都是不科学”，说我们认为“社会主义里的社会科学要从头创造，没有可以继承”等等。这是十足的胡说八道。谁都知道，马克思主义也是资本主义社会里形成的社会科学，难道我们说它是“不科学”吗？在社会主义社会里不继承“资本主义社会里的社会科学”是不可想像的。我们马克思主义者是最重视历史遗产和真正继承了历史遗产的。列宁说得好：“哲学史和社会科学史已十分明显地表明：马克思没有丝毫与‘宗派主义’相像的东西，它绝对不是一种什么离开世界文明发展大道而产生出来的偏狭顽固的学说。恰巧相反，马克思的全部天才，正在于他回答了人类先进思想所已提出的种种问题。他的学说是直接继承那些伟大的哲学家、政治经济学家和社会主义者的学说而起的。”除了作为马克思主义的三个来源的德国古典哲学，英国政治经济学，法国社会主义之外，我们还可以从普列哈诺夫的著作中看到马克思主义者对复辟时代法国历史学家的推崇。就是资产阶级学者所作的农村调查、发表的政论等等，列宁在“我们究竟拒绝什么遗产”一文中也给以很好的评价。但是马克思主义者对现代资产阶级的反动的哲学，反动的“社会科学”却坚决采取拒绝的态度。右派的哲学社会科学家，认为这种态度是我们拒绝优秀的文化遗产。对这种责难我们可以学习列宁在上面所说的那篇文章里提问题的方法问他们一声：为什么不能相反地说，这种拒绝是表明我们主张把这些反动的反科学的东西，从人类历史优秀传统中清洗出去呢？
    当然，我们对资产阶级所谓“社会科学”采取原则否定的态度，并不等于说我们根本不去理睬它们。资产阶级反动的哲学和反动的所谓“社会科学”在今天欧美资本主义国家是占统治地位的。在这些国家中它们起着很大的作用。它对我们的国家也不断发生影响。同时欧美资产阶级“社会科学”输入中国后，已有几十年的历史，中国资产阶级学者在这方面也有自己的发挥。因此如果不让这些错误思想表现出来，不去研究他们的这些错误的学术观点，我们就不能有力地给以驳斥，因而也不能清除它们在知识分子中间、在人民中间的影响。同时在资产阶级反动的哲学和“社会科学”的著作中也不是一点对我们有用的材料也没有。为要研究资本主义国家里的社会现象，我们就要利用这些“学者”们的著作。照列宁的话说，不利用这些资产阶级的有学识的帮办的著作，我们对资本主义国家的研究“就不能前进一步”。问题是我们在利用这些著作的时候，一定要认清并批判它们的反动倾向，不允许奴隶般的追随资产阶级的哲学和“社会科学”，更不允许借口可以利用资产阶级学者著作中的某些有用的材料，来进行资产阶级反动思想的宣传。“百花齐放，百家争鸣”是促进艺术发展和科学进步的方针。依据这个方针，去年在某些高等学校开设了某些介绍与批判唯心主义哲学和资产阶级“社会科学”（如凯恩斯经济学）的课程，中国科学院也着手安排过去研究资产阶级“社会科学”的先生们的研究工作。这个方针必须继续贯彻。但是决不允许右派分子利用这个方针来进行反党反社会主义的活动，以此为借口妄图资产阶级社会科学复辟，篡夺马克思列宁主义在我国的领导地位。
    我们对资产阶级“社会科学”的态度是完全正确的，用不着有什么改变。资产阶级右派对解放以来我们对“旧社会科学”的态度，表示如此愤懑，进行如此恶毒的攻击，目的就是要为资产阶级“社会科学”制造社会舆论。资产阶级右派除了公开地提出要“重视”、“恢复”资产阶级“社会科学”外，他们在反社会主义科学纲领中还提出了另外一个要求，那就是：主张“对旧社会科学”应该进行“改造”，反对采取原则否定的态度。这个提法曾经迷惑了一些人。但是现代资产阶级“社会科学”从根本上既然是反科学的、反动的，试问怎样来对它进行改造呢？对这个问题，右派用行动作了回答。他们不是提出要“建立”“无产阶级社会学”吗？他们不是提出要吸收凯恩斯的某些原理来充实发展马克思主义的政治经济学吗？右派分子所谓“改造”，难道不就是要在资产阶级“社会科学”的基础上，修修补补，打扮得漂亮一些，穿上一件马克思列宁主义的外衣，以便混水摸鱼，欺骗青年吗？在右派看来这是资产阶级“社会科学”复辟的一条阻力较小的出路。我们一定要揭穿资产阶级右派的这种卑鄙阴险的手法。
    为要把我国建设成为一个社会主义社会，毫无疑问必须发展马克思列宁主义的社会科学。某些阶级性比较不强的学科如语言学、考古学等等也要在马克思列宁主义的指导下进行。这是我们坚定不移的方针。要发展社会科学，当前我们要做的事情，不是“首先要改变对旧社会科学的态度”，而是进一步深入开展社会科学界反右派的斗争，彻底粉碎右派分子图谋资产阶级“社会科学”复辟的阴谋，把关于社会科学的形形色色的反共反社会主义的荒谬言论驳倒。这是一场尖锐的政治斗争。为了取得这一斗争的胜利，还要在首都和外地进行一个时期的工作。但是社会科学界的斗争还不能进行到这里为止。在今后一个相当长的时期内，我们还要在学术界展开一场大规模的思想辩论，对资产阶级“社会科学”，在我国学术界曾经发生过影响的首先是资产阶级社会学、经济学、法学、政治学等，进行彻底的清算。我们相信，经过这场社会科学战线上的大论争，资产阶级“社会科学”在我国知识分子中的影响一定会更加大大削弱，马克思列宁主义的理论队伍将会更加壮大，对广大知识分子和人民群众的社会主义教育的内容，因为增加了这方面的生动的战斗的材料，将更加丰富。让我们高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜为我国社会科学的发展而战斗吧！
