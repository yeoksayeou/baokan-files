　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, 18th: The United Nations General Assembly's twelfth session opened on September 17th, presided over by the President of the previous session, Thailand's Wan Waithayakon.

　　After Wan Waithayakon delivered a speech, the meeting elected the President of the twelfth session of the General Assembly. With the withdrawal of the Lebanese candidate, Charles Malik, the other candidate, New Zealand's Leslie Munro, was elected by a majority of seventy-seven votes.

　　Munro then delivered his inaugural address. He said that he anticipated that the delegations of various countries would unanimously agree to prioritize the discussion of disarmament issues, and he believed that efforts should be made to resolve this long-standing stalemate.

　　The General Assembly then unanimously voted to approve the admission of the newly independent Malaya as the eighty-second member state of the United Nations.

　　Yesterday's meeting also elected the chairmen of the various committees of the General Assembly. The Chairman of the Political Committee is Iran's Jalal Abdoh; the Chairman of the Special Political Committee is Guatemala's Emilio Arenales Catalán; the Chairman of the Economic Committee is Czechoslovakia's Jiří Nosek; the Chairman of the Social Committee is Norway's Aase Lionæs; and the Chairman of the Trusteeship Committee is Thailand's Thanat Khoman.

　　联大第十二届会议开幕
　　一致通过接纳马来亚加入联合国
    新华社18日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会第十二届会议9月17日在上届大会主席泰国的旺·威泰耶康主持下开幕。
    在旺·威泰耶康发表演说以后，会议选举了十二届大会的主席。由于候选人黎巴嫩的马利克宣布退出竞选，另一个候选人新西兰的莱斯利·孟罗以七十七票的多数当选。
    孟罗随即发表了就职演说。他说，他预料各国代表团将一致同意优先讨论裁军问题，他认为应当努力来解决这个僵持已久的问题。
    大会接着一致投票赞成接纳新近独立的马来亚为联合国的第八十二个成员国。
    昨天会议还选出了大会各委员会的主席人选。政治委员会主席是伊朗的贾拉尔·阿卜杜；特别政治委员会主席是危地马拉的埃米略·阿雷纳累斯·卡塔兰；经济委员会主席是捷克斯洛伐克的伊里诺西克；社会委员会主席是挪威的阿赛·利昂内斯夫人；托管委员会主席是泰国的塔纳特·科曼。
