    We, the people of the whole country, are welcoming the eighth anniversary of the National Day in a high tide of tremendous labor and political enthusiasm. In these days, the golden wind sends coolness, and guests come one after another. A joyful atmosphere is spreading all over the motherland. We are very pleased to see that among the distinguished guests we welcome are the representatives of the Czechoslovak people who have come from afar. The Czechoslovak National Assembly delegation, led by Chairman Fierlinger, is scheduled to arrive in Beijing today to begin a friendly visit to our country. We are convinced that this visit will be of great significance in further strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Czechoslovak people.
    Czechoslovakia is a highly developed industrial country and a strong fortress in the socialist camp. In the more than ten years since liberation, the Czechoslovak people have achieved brilliant achievements in the cause of building socialism. Czechoslovakia's industrial and agricultural production has greatly developed on its original basis. On the basis of developing production, the people's material and cultural levels are constantly improving. The Czechoslovak people have also made important contributions to the cause of maintaining world peace, easing international tensions, and promoting international cooperation. Czechoslovakia has consistently strived to oppose the rearmament of West Germany and to strive for a European collective security system. As a participant in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission overseeing the Korean armistice, Czechoslovakia has also played an important role in stabilizing the Korean armistice agreement and maintaining peace in Asia. Czechoslovakia's efforts to promote cooperation among socialist countries and consolidate the unity of the socialist camp have been valued and praised by the people of socialist countries.
    The Chinese people and the Czechoslovak people are like-minded brothers. We have a history of common struggle, in which we have given each other sympathy, care and support. Especially after the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the friendly relations between our two countries have been fully developed. The economic exchanges and cultural exchanges between China and Czechoslovakia have been increasing year by year, and the cooperation between the two countries in the struggle for peace and socialism has also been strengthened day by day. The distance between Prague and Beijing is getting shorter and shorter. As Prime Minister Široký said: "The common struggle for socialism and peace has promoted the rapprochement and fraternal friendship between our two peoples. This common struggle has built a solid bridge of friendship, mutual respect and comprehensive cooperation between this distant distance."
    Among the friendly relations between China and Czechoslovakia, it is particularly worth mentioning the friendly visit to Czechoslovakia by the delegation of the National People's Congress of China and the delegation of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, headed by Comrade Peng Zhen, in December last year. The two delegations sent by our country received an extremely warm and cordial reception in Czechoslovakia. This is a manifestation of the Czechoslovak people's deep friendship with the people of our country. The visit to our country by the Czechoslovak government delegation headed by Prime Minister Široký in the spring of this year wrote an important page in the history of Sino-Czechoslovak friendship. This visit achieved significant results and signed the Sino-Czechoslovak Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation. This has solidified the fraternal friendship between our two countries in the form of a treaty, and laid the foundation for greater development of friendly cooperation between the two countries in the future.
    After the signing of the Sino-Czechoslovak Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, the friendly relations between our two countries have been further developed. The visit of the Czechoslovak National Assembly delegation headed by Comrade Fierlinger is undoubtedly an important symbol of this development. While warmly welcoming the envoys of the Czechoslovak people, we deeply thank Czechoslovakia for its important assistance to our country's socialist construction, thank the Czechoslovak parliamentary delegation for bringing us the deep friendship of our dear Czechoslovak brothers, and wish the unbreakable Sino-Czechoslovak friendship lasting forever.

    中捷友谊发展的重要标志
    我们全国人民正在巨大的劳动和政治热情的高潮中迎接国庆节八周年的到来。在这些日子里，金风送爽，嘉宾接踵，欢乐的气氛洋溢在祖国各地。我们很高兴地看到，在我们欢迎的贵宾行列中，有远道前来的捷克斯洛伐克人民的代表。在费林格主席的率领下，捷克斯洛伐克国民议会代表团定于今天到达首都北京，开始对我国的友好访问。我们深信，这次访问对进一步加强中捷两国人民之间的友谊合作将有重大的意义。
    捷克斯洛伐克是一个工业高度发达的国家，是社会主义阵营中的一个坚强堡垒。在解放以后的十多年来，捷克斯洛伐克人民在建设社会主义的事业中，已经获得了辉煌的成就。捷克斯洛伐克的工农业生产在原有的基础上大大地向前发展了。在发展生产的基础上，人民的物质文化水平正在不断地提高。捷克斯洛伐克人民对维护世界和平、缓和国际紧张局势和促进国际合作的事业，也作出了重要的贡献。捷克斯洛伐克一贯为反对重新武装西德、争取欧洲集体安全体系而努力。作为监督朝鲜停战的中立国监察委员会的参加者，捷克斯洛伐克也对稳定朝鲜的停战协定和维护亚洲和平起了重要的作用。捷克斯洛伐克为促进社会主义各国的合作和巩固社会主义阵营团结的努力，得到了社会主义各国人民的重视和赞扬。
    中国人民和捷克斯洛伐克人民是志同道合的兄弟。我们有着共同斗争的历史，在这个斗争中曾经相互给予了同情、关怀和支持。特别在中华人民共和国建立以后，我们两国的友好关系有了全面的发展。中捷两国的经济往来和文化交流一年比一年增进，两国在争取和平和社会主义斗争中的合作也日益加强。布拉格——北京之间的距离是越来越缩短了。正如西罗基总理所说的：“争取社会主义和争取和平的共同斗争，促进了我们两国人民的接近和兄弟般的友谊。这个共同斗争在这段遥远的距离之间架起了一座友谊、互相敬爱和全面合作的坚固桥梁。”
    在中捷两国的友好关系中，特别值得指出的是以彭真同志为首的我全国人民代表大会代表团和北京市人民委员会代表团在去年12月间对捷克斯洛伐克的友好访问。我国派出的这两个代表团在捷克斯洛伐克受到了极其热烈和亲切的接待。这是捷克斯洛伐克人民对我国人民深厚友谊的表现。今年春天以西罗基总理为首的捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团对我国的访问，在中捷友谊史上写下了重要的一页。这次访问取得了重大的成果，并签订了中捷友好合作条约。这使我们两国兄弟般的友谊用条约的形式固定下来了，也为今后两国友好合作的更大发展奠定了基础。
    在中捷友好合作条约签订之后，我们两国之间的友好关系又有了进一步的发展。这次以费林格同志为首的捷克斯洛伐克国民议会代表团的来访，无疑是这种发展的重要标志。在热烈欢迎捷克斯洛伐克人民的使者的时候，我们深深地感谢捷克斯洛伐克对我国社会主义建设事业的重要援助，感谢捷克斯洛伐克议会代表团给我们带来了亲爱的捷克斯洛伐克兄弟的深情厚谊，并且祝牢不可破的中捷友谊万古常青。（附图片）
