	More Than Two Hundred New and Reconstructed Factories and Mines
	Industrially Backward Jiangxi Has Changed
	(Our dispatch) Before liberation, Jiangxi Province had a very weak industrial base. In recent years, it has newly built and reconstructed 226 state-owned and local state-owned industrial and mining enterprises, and the province's industrial landscape has been completely renewed.

	These newly built and reconstructed industrial and mining enterprises include coal, machinery manufacturing, textiles, paper making, chemicals, sugar refining, and other industries. The province, which previously had no hydroelectric power stations, motors, iron smelting, fertilizers, underwear, rubber, enamelware, or meat joint processing plants, has now established them. The original coal, electric power, machinery, and textile industries have also been developed.

	Before liberation, the province did not have a single factory manufacturing machines, and only a few dilapidated lathes were scattered around to do some parts repair work. Now, the expanded Jiangxi Machinery Factory can not only manufacture water pumps, cart discs, diesel engines... but also has begun to manufacture more technically complex gas engines. In recent years, in addition to supporting the province's agricultural drought resistance and meeting the needs of construction departments, this factory has also supported key construction projects in North China, East China, Northeast China, Hunan, and other places. The factory's output in 1956 increased fivefold compared to 1955. Before liberation, Jiangxi Province relied on Shanghai and other places for the supply of motor equipment. Now, a new motor factory has been built that can manufacture various types of generators, motors, transformers, etc. This factory also manufactured a batch of Soviet-style MД generators for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam this year, and the quality reached national standards. Due to the putting into operation of the newly built and rebuilt mechanical industries, the province's local mechanical industry has, in accordance with national requirements, moved from assembly to manufacturing and from imitation to independent design.

	During the First Five-Year Plan period, Jiangxi Province also built and rebuilt a number of small and medium-sized coal mines. The province's raw coal production increased by 146% compared to 1952, and by 1.3 times compared to the highest year in history. In particular, after the construction of the new coal bases in Zhongjiashan and Dongjiashan and the reconstruction of the Tianhe Coal Mine, not only has heavy manual labor been changed to semi-mechanized production, greatly developing the production of bituminous coal, but also the unreasonable phenomenon that most of the raw coal production was concentrated in Pingxiang in the past has been changed, so that the coal use in the Gan Northeast area has been reasonably supplied.

	Jiangxi Province has 17 million people. Before liberation, the province only had two textile factories with limited production capacity, with a combined total of only 20,000 spindles. Today, Jiangxi Province has established a textile industry base. In addition to expanding the original yarn factories, a new cotton textile printing and dyeing factory with 50,000 spindles and 1,500 looms capable of printing and dyeing cloth has been built. Now, the number of spindles in the province has increased fivefold compared to before liberation, cotton yarn production has increased by 331% compared to 1952, and cotton cloth has also increased by 489%. At the same time, a new underwear factory has been built, and recently, a modern ramie textile factory has also started construction.

### 新建改建厂矿两百多个  工业落后的江西变了样

    新建改建厂矿两百多个
    工业落后的江西变了样
    本报讯　解放前工业基础非常薄弱的江西省，几年来已经新建和改建了二百二十六个国营、地方国营工矿企业，全省工业面貌焕然一新。
    在这些新建和改建的工矿企业中，包括有煤炭、机器制造、纺织、造纸、化工、制糖等行业。这个省过去从来没有过的水电站、电机、炼铁、肥料、内衣、橡胶、搪瓷、肉类联合加工等工厂，现在已经建立；原有的煤炭、电力、机械、纺织工业，现在也有了发展。
    解放前，这个省没有一家制造机器的工厂，只有少数破旧车床，分散在各地做一些零件修配任务。现在扩建后的江西机械厂，不仅能制造抽水机、牛车盘、柴油机……而且开始制造技术比较复杂的煤气机。这个厂几年来除支援全省农业抗旱和满足建设部门需要外，还支援了华北、华东、东北、湖南等地重点建设。这个厂1956年的产量比1955年增加了五倍。江西省解放前，需要电机设备都是依赖上海等地供应，现在已经新建了一座电机厂，能够制造各种不同类型的发电机、电动机、变压器等。这个厂今年还为越南民主共和国制造了一批仿苏МД型发电机，质量达到国家标准。由于新建和改建的机械工业投入生产，这个省地方机械工业已按国家要求，由装配到制造，从仿制走上了独立设计。
    在第一个五年计划期间，江西省还新建和改建了一批中小型煤矿。全省原煤产量比1952年增长146％，跟历史上最高年份比较，增长了一点三倍。特别是新建煤炭基地钟家山、董家山和改建天河煤矿后，不仅将笨重体力劳动改为半机械化生产，大大发展了烟煤生产，而且改变了过去原煤生产大部分集中在萍乡一带的不合理现象，使赣东北地区用煤，得到合理供应。
    江西省有一千七百万人口，解放前全省只有两家生产能力不大的纺织厂，合起来只有二万纱锭；今天江西省建立了纺织工业基地，除原有的纱厂进行了扩建外，并新建了一座拥有五万纱锭、一千五百台织布机能够印染色布的棉纺织印染厂。现在全省纱锭比解放前增加了五倍，棉纱产量比1952年增长了331％，棉布也增长了489％。和这同时，还新建了一座内衣厂，最近，一座现代化的麻纺织厂，也已动工兴建。
