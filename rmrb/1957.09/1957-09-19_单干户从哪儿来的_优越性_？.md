Where Do Individual Farmers Get Their “Superiority” From?
By a commentator from this newspaper

“Does agricultural production cooperation have superiority?” is still an important topic in the current rural debate.

A small number of people who have already joined cooperatives are still wavering. During the high tide of agricultural cooperation, they "followed the crowd" into the cooperatives, and until now have not truly recognized and firmly believed in the superiority of the cooperative system.

Those who have not joined the cooperatives originally did not recognize the superiority of the cooperative system. They are now only a scattered minority in the countryside. However, some of them are still stubbornly expressing themselves, promoting the so-called "superiority of individual farming" that they have fabricated.

Indeed, some individual farmers have seemed to be living "quite well" in the past year or two. Compared to some cooperative members, they have more grain, more money, and more "freedom." They even deliberately boast about their "good life" in front of cooperative members, provoking the relationship between the members and the cooperative. This makes the part of the cooperative members who are still somewhat wavering feel even more uneasy.

Where exactly does the "superiority" of these individual farmers come from?

In many places, after extensive debates, the "mystery" of this "riddle" has been revealed.

One of the reasons why some individual farmers are living better than some cooperative members is that most individual farmers were originally wealthy middle peasants with a thicker foundation and more fertile land. Some newly established cooperatives have not yet caught up with the level of wealthy middle peasants in terms of production investment and members' living expenses. This is a fact and should be admitted. However, the facts have also proven that a cooperative, after being run for about five years, can catch up with and even surpass the production level of wealthy middle peasants. Moreover, it will be run better year by year, and agricultural and sideline production can develop in an all-round way. Basic farmland construction can exert tremendous power. The increase in members' income, the guarantee of material life, and the happy spiritual and cultural life cannot be compared to any individual farmers.

Another reason is that "some individual farmers no longer engage in basic farmland construction, no longer store and invest more production funds, and they try their best to spend more money and grain on 'improving their lives,' and even sell their livestock and spend the money." In this way, for a time, their lives seem to be going quite well. On the one hand, they have doubts and resistance to the Party's policies. On the other hand, they want to use this method to entice members to withdraw from the cooperative. This is a "burn the boats" tactic. Obviously, this method cannot last. Many agricultural cooperatives adhere to the principle of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily. For the sake of long-term and greater interests, the members are willing to save money on food and clothing and invest more manpower, material resources, and financial resources in basic farmland construction. In this way, they will be in an invincible position forever. What the individual farmers are showing is a decadent, declining image, while what the cooperative is showing is an image of building a business and starting a career.

A small number of cooperatives have some problems in their work due to the lack of experience or poor style of the cadres, and have not done a good job in production and distribution, so that the income of more members is not as good as that of some individual farmers, or the members feel that their household sideline businesses and daily lives are subject to excessive restrictions. These are also facts. However, the internal disunity of some cooperatives, the emotional turmoil of the members, and the failure of production or distribution are precisely the result of the troublemaking of people inside and outside the cooperative who oppose the cooperative (including some wealthy farmers). The shortcomings in the work of the cooperative cadres are not the shortcomings of the cooperative system, and can be corrected.

Relatively speaking, the above-mentioned are not the most important reasons. Judging from the situation of some individual farmers revealed in many places, the origin of "individual farming superiority" is nothing more than deception and exploitation. The yield per unit area on the land of many individual farmers is not higher than that of the cooperative, but their food rations and money are more than those of the cooperative members. Why is this? First, they concealed land and production, and paid less public grain and sold less surplus grain; second, they defaulted on public grain and unified purchase grain year after year; third, they illegally engaged in grain speculation and other speculative transactions to seek exorbitant profits; fourth, they rented livestock to other individual farmers at high prices and lent money to poor farmers at high interest rates; fifth, they did not obey the guidance of the national plan and changed grain fields and cotton fields to grow medicinal materials, water chestnuts, etc.; sixth, they did not abide by national laws, evaded obligatory labor, and enjoyed the benefits of water conservancy without contributing to it. The more grain and money they have, the more they get from these crooked ways. The “freedom” is obtained by exchanging the pain of others and the loss of the country.

Why does this happen?

The fundamental reason is that the individual farmers themselves have problems. Generally speaking, farmers have a dual nature. The side of being a laborer is smaller than that of other farmers for this part of farmers (most of whom are wealthy middle peasants), and the side of being a private owner is larger than that of other farmers. This is determined by their economic status; at the same time, it is also closely related to their lack of socialist ideological education. They also regard not participating in meetings and not receiving ideological education as a major "freedom" and a major "superiority" of individual farming! In fact, in the long run, it is also detrimental to themselves to do so. The result of the development of capitalism can only be that a very few people climb up, and most people will fall down. Since this is detrimental to the country, and the country cannot become rich and strong, it will also be detrimental to them. If this is done, production cannot be greatly developed, and their "money, grain" and "freedom" will be very limited. If they continue to do so, these people will surely fall behind the times. Most people are gloriously and happily moving forward on the socialist road, and these few people will finally find out how short-sighted they are and how ridiculous it is to dream of gold in broad daylight. Of course, they still have a positive side as laborers. As long as they are treated with a correct attitude and educated with appropriate methods, they may embark on the socialist road.

It must be clearly seen that in some places, Party organizations and government workers also have some shortcomings in their treatment of individual farmers: they have abandoned or relaxed political and ideological education and economic leadership for individual farmers, and they are either rude and discriminatory or laissez-faire. There was a time when some places adopted a method of "suppression" against individual farmers. From the article by the Baoying County Committee of Jiangsu Province published in this newspaper today, it can be understood that this method can only make these individual farmers move further away from the socialist road, and even make some people hurt their feelings. After understanding the benefits of the cooperative system, they are still unwilling to join the cooperative. Some places have adopted an attitude of "indulgence" towards individual farmers. All work is focused only on cooperatives. Since individual farmers have become a very small number, it seems that they are "dispensable and insignificant" for completing the tasks of various economic works. No one cares if individual farmers do not pay public grain, do not sell surplus grain, do not work to build dikes and roads, do not plant according to national plans, or even abandon land to do speculative production. Since many loopholes have been left, individual farmers will naturally take advantage of them. They are not invited to any meetings, and the light of socialism is not used to illuminate individual farmers. However, whenever they are mentioned, they are simply said to be "stubborn and backward," with a great tendency to "reject them thousands of miles away." Naturally, it is difficult for individual farmers to make progress.

The experience of Baoying County, Jiangsu Province, in holding a meeting of representatives of individual farmers shows that individual farmers should neither be "suppressed" nor "indulged." Patiently and enthusiastically enlighten them, explain the truth to them, show them the facts, and let them "freely speak out and air their views" and argue freely. They can accept socialism. A meeting can be held well, not only solving the problem of unified purchase and sales, but also having more than 88% of individual farmers expressing their willingness to join the cooperative. Of course, this is not only the effect of this meeting, but is inseparable from the achievements of cooperative work and other works. However, the role of such a meeting must not be ignored. Some places have adopted the method of holding debates between cooperative members and individual farmers to solve the problem of "whether the cooperative system is superior or individual farming is superior." As long as they adhere to reasoning and do not turn it into a "struggle session," it is also possible.

As for the illegal activities of a small number of individual farmers, they should of course be dealt with according to law. In various economic works, individual farmers should not be allowed to take advantage of loopholes. However, attention should also be paid to treating cooperatives and individual farmers equally and without discrimination. Under the same conditions, individual farmers should be allowed to compete with cooperatives. Only in this way can individual farmers be truly convinced. We should have the confidence that cooperatives will definitely be able to win!

### 单干户从哪儿来的“优越性”？

　　单干户从哪儿来的“优越性”？
　　本报评论员
    “农业生产合作社是不是有优越性”目前仍然是农村大辩论中的一个重要题目。
    已经入社的人，有一小部分仍然是动摇的。他们在农业合作化的高潮中“随大流”涌入了合作社，直到现在还没有真正认清和坚决相信合作制度的优越性。
    没有入社的人，本来就不承认合作制度有优越性。他们在农村已经只不过是零零落落的极少数了。可是，他们之中有一部分人仍在极顽强地表现着自己，宣扬着他们制造出来的所谓“单干的优越性”。
    确实有一些单干农民近一两年的日子过得似乎“挺不错”，比起一部分社员来，粮也多，钱也多，“自由”也多。他们甚至故意在社员面前夸耀自己的“好生活”，挑拨社员和合作社的关系。这样，思想仍然有些动摇的一部分社员，心里就更不安稳了。
    这一部分单干农民的“优越性”究竟是从哪里来的？
    在许多地方，经过大辩论，已经揭露出来了这个“谜”的“谜底”。
    一部分单干农民的日子过得比一些社员好，原因之一是：大部分单干农民本来就是富裕中农，底子比较厚，土地比较肥；一些新办起来的合作社，在生产投资和社员生活费用等方面，一时还没有赶上富裕中农的水平。这是事实，应当承认。可是，事实也证明了：一个合作社，办了五年左右，就可以赶上以至超过富裕中农的生产水平；而且以后还会一年比一年办得更好，农副业生产可以全面大发展，农田基本建设可以发挥巨大的力量，社员的收入的增加、物质生活的有保证、精神文化生活的愉快，不是任何单干农民所能比得上的。
    又一个原因是“有些单干农民不再从事农田基本建设了，不再储备和投入更多的生产资金了，他们尽可能把钱和粮食多用在‘改善生活’上边，甚至把牲口卖了把钱花掉。”这样，一时看起来，他们的生活过得挺好。他们这样做，一方面是对党的政策有疑虑和抵触的情绪，一方面是想用这办法引诱社员退社，是用的“破釜沉舟”之计。很明显，这办法是不能持久的。许多农业社坚持勤俭办社的原则，社员们为了长远的更大的利益，宁愿节衣缩食把更多的人力物力财力投入农田基本建设，这样，就立于永远不败之地。那一部分单干农民表现出来的是败家没落气象，合作社表现出来的却是兴家立业气象。
    一小部分合作社，由于干部缺乏经验或者作风不好，工作上出了一些毛病，没有把生产和分配工作做好，以至使较多的社员的收入比不上一部分单干农民，或者使社员感到家庭副业和日常生活上受到过多的限制，这些也是事实。但是，有些合作社内部不团结，社员情绪动荡，生产或分配没有搞好，却正是社内外反对合作社的人（包括一部分富裕农民在内）兴风作浪的结果。社干部工作上的缺点并不是合作制度的缺点，是可以改正的。
    比较起来，以上谈到的都还不是最主要的原因。从许多地方揭露出来的一些单干农民的情况看来，“单干优越”的来历，不外乎欺骗和剥削。许多单干农民的土地上的单位面积产量并不比合作社的高，他们的口粮和钱却比社员的多，这是为什么？一因他们瞒地、瞒产少交了公粮、少卖了余粮；二因他们年年拖欠公粮、统购粮；三因他们违法进行粮食投机和别的投机买卖，牟取暴利；四因他们向别的单干农民高价出租牲口、向贫困农民放高利贷；五因他们不服从国家计划的指导，把粮田棉田改种药材、荸荠等等；六因他们不遵守国家法律，逃避义务工，不修水利却坐享其成；……。粮多，钱多，原来是从这些邪门歪道里面得来的；“自由”，原来是用别人的痛苦和国家的损失换来的。
    为什么会出现这样的事情？
    根本的原因，还是单干农民本身有毛病。一般地说，农民都有两重性。这一部分农民（其中绝大部分是富裕中农），作为劳动者的一面比别的农民要小一些，作为私有者的一面比别的农民要大一些。这是他们的经济地位决定的；同时，同他们没有接受社会主义的思想教育也有很大关系。他们还把不参加开会、不受思想教育也当作单干的一大“自由”、一大“优越性”呢！实际上，他们这样做，从长远来看，对他们自己也是不利的。发展资本主义的结果，只可能有极少数人爬上去，大多数人会跌下来。这样做既然对国家不利，国家不能富强起来，对他们就也会有所不利。这样做，生产不能大大发展，他们的“有钱、有粮”和“自由”也就都很有限。这样做下去，他们这些人一定要落在时代后面；大多数人都光荣地愉快地在社会主义大道上前进着，他们这少数人终于会发现自己是多么近视，在大白天做“黄金梦”是多么可笑。当然，他们毕竟还有作为劳动者的积极的一面。只要用正确的态度对待他们，用适当的方法教育他们，他们是可能走上社会主义道路的。
    一定要看清，在一些地方，党组织和政府工作人员在对待单干农民方面也有一些缺点：对于单干农民放弃或者放松了政治思想教育和经济上的领导，不是粗暴、歧视，就是放任自流。曾经有一个时期，有一些地方对单干农民采取了“压”的办法。从今天本报发表的江苏宝应县委的文章里就可以了解，这种办法只能使这些单干农民更远地离开社会主义道路，甚至使有的人伤了感情，在懂得了合作制度的好处以后仍然不肯入社。有一些地方，对单干农民采取了“纵”的态度。一切工作，只抓合作社。单干农民既然成了极少数，对于完成各项经济工作的任务似乎是“可有可无，微不足道”的了。单干农民不交公粮，不卖余粮，不出工修堤修路，不按国家计划种植，甚至荒废土地去做投机生产，都没人管。既然留下了许多空子，单干农民自然就要去钻。开什么会都不找单干农民，不用社会主义的光芒去照射单干农民，却又总是一提起他们来就简单地说他们“顽固、落后”，大有“拒之于千里之外”之势，单干农民自然就难进步。
    江苏宝应县召开单干农民代表会议的经验说明，对单干农民，既不可“压”，也不可“纵”。耐心地热心地启发他们，向他们讲清道理、摆明事实，让他们“大放大鸣”，自由争辩，他们是能够接受社会主义的。一次会开得好，不但统购统销问题解决了，而且有88％以上的单干农民表示愿意入社。这当然不光是这一次会的效果，是同办社工作和别的工作的成绩分不开的。但是，也决不可忽视这样一次会的作用。有些地方采取了让社员和单干农民在一起开辩论会的方式，解决“究竟是合作制度优越还是单干优越”的问题。只要坚持说理，不要开成“斗争会”，那也是可以的。
    至于少数单干农民的违法活动，当然应该依法处理。在各项经济工作上，都要使单干农民没有空子可钻。不过，也要注意对合作社和单干农民同样对待，不加歧视。在同样的条件下，应该允许单干农民同合作社比赛。只有这样，才能使单干农民真正心服。我们应该有这样的信心：合作社一定能够比得赢！
