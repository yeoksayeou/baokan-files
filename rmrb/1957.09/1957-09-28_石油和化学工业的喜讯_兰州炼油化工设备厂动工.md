Good News for the Petroleum and Chemical Industry
    Lanzhou Oil Refining and Chemical Equipment Plant Starts Construction

    (Our newspaper reports) Our country's first modern oil refining and chemical equipment plant broke ground on September 23 in the western suburbs of Lanzhou.

    This new type of oil refining and chemical equipment plant is designed with Soviet assistance, based on the latest technological achievements combined with China's actual conditions. Some large and special equipment will be supplied by the Soviet Union. In order to ensure that product quality reaches international standards, the factory's product quality inspection will employ ultrasonic flaw detectors or test with gamma rays and X-rays.

    In order to implement the principle of "building the country diligently and thriftily, and running enterprises diligently and thriftily," the plant construction plan has been changed in the design. They have made full use of the advantageous conditions of the close proximity of the Lanzhou Oil Refining and Chemical Equipment Plant and the Lanzhou Petroleum Machinery Plant, combining the construction of twelve engineering projects such as the two plants' steel casting, iron casting, forging heat treatment, gas generating station, and garage. Preliminary calculations show that this can save 15 million yuan in investment, and the equipment utilization rate will be fully utilized. Due to the cooperative approach, the factory's management personnel, power supply, and service facilities can be relatively reduced, and future production costs can also be reduced by 7%.

    The first phase of the Lanzhou Oil Refining and Chemical Equipment Plant will be completed and put into production in 1959. After going into operation, it will be able to mass-produce large-scale main equipment like that of the new Lanzhou Oil Refinery, Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant, and Lanzhou Rubber Plant, such as catalytic cracking units, cracking towers, distillation towers, scrubbing towers, high-pressure alloy towers, heating furnaces, heat exchangers, high-pressure vessels, as well as machinery and equipment for manufacturing dyes and plastics, thereby gradually changing the backward state of China's petroleum and chemical industry.

    石油和化学工业的喜讯
    兰州炼油化工设备厂动工
    本报讯　我国第一座现代化的炼油化工设备厂，于9月23日在兰州西郊破土开工了。
    这座新型的炼油化工设备厂，是苏联根据最新的技术成就结合我国实际情况帮助设计的，一部分大型和特殊设备由苏联供应。为使产品质量达到国际标准，这个工厂的产品质量检查将采用超音波探伤仪或用珈玛射线及爱克斯光射线透视检验。
    为了贯彻“勤俭建国、勤俭办企业”的方针，在设计中又变更了建厂方案。他们充分利用了兰州炼油化工设备厂和兰州石油机械厂两厂相隔很近的优越条件，把两厂的铸钢、铸铁、锻工热处理、煤气发生站和汽车库等十二个工程项目合并建筑，初步计算能节约投资一千五百万元，设备利用率将得到充分发挥。由于采取了协作的办法，工厂的管理人员、动力供应和服务设施都能相对的减少，将来的生产成本也能降低7％。
    兰州炼油化工设备厂第一期工程将在1959年建成，投入生产后，它能大量生产像新建兰州炼油厂、兰州肥料厂、兰州橡胶厂的那样大型的主要设备，如催化裂化装置、裂炼塔、蒸溜塔、水洗塔、高压的合金塔，加热炉、换热器、高压容器以及制造染料和塑料的机器设备，从而会逐渐改变我国石油和化学工业落后的面貌。　（刘丰年）
