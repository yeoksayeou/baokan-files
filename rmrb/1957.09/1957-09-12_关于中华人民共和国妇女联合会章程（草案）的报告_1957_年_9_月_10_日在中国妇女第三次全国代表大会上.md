Report on the Constitution (Draft) of the All-China Women's Federation
Presented at the Third National Women's Congress of China on September 10, 1957
Cao Guanqun

Fellow Delegates:

    Discussing and passing the Constitution of the All-China Women's Federation is an important item on the agenda of this congress. Based on the new tasks put forward by the new situation and the needs of the development of women's federation organizations at all levels across the country, and on the basis of summarizing the experience of women's federation organization building in recent years, the current "Constitution of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation" has been expanded and revised into a unified constitution for women's federation organizations at all levels in the People's Republic of China. Before being submitted to the congress, this draft constitution was distributed to women's federation organizations in various provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and some counties, cities (districts), as well as relevant groups for discussion, and the opinions of everyone were incorporated into the revisions.

    The new draft constitution has many expansions and important revisions compared with the current constitution. In the general principles section, the new guidelines and tasks of the women's federation organizations are stipulated according to the new situation, and the organizational line, organizational principles, leadership style, and basic working methods of the women's federation are stipulated. In other chapters, specific provisions are made for grassroots women's federation organizations, local women's federation organizations at all levels, the national leading organs of the women's federation, and group members. Now, I will make some explanations on the following issues.

    (I)

    The first important difference between the new draft constitution and the current constitution is the change in the name of the women's federation organization. That is, the All-China Women's Federation is used as the general name for women's federations at all levels nationwide. The name of the national leading organ has been changed from the original "All-China Democratic Women's Federation" to the All-China Women's Federation; the name of the local organizations has been changed from the original Democratic Women's Federation of a certain place to the Women's Federation of a certain place. The reason for this change is, as everyone knows, that the current situation in our country and the tasks of women across the country are fundamentally different from those at the time of the First National Women's Congress in 1949, and there have also been fundamental changes compared with the time of the Second National Women's Congress. At the time of the First National Women's Congress in 1949, the country had not yet been completely liberated, and the People's Republic of China had not yet been established. At that time, it was still in the stage of the New Democratic Revolution, so the First Women's Congress determined that the task of the women's federation was to: unite the women masses of all ethnic groups and all strata across the country and the people of the whole country to carry out the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism to the end, completely eliminate the remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and strive to build a unified people's democratic republic, and to complete the New Democratic Revolution; and strive to achieve equality between men and women and the liberation of women. According to the situation and tasks at that time, the women's federation organization mainly united all women who were struggling for the democratic revolution. At that time, it was appropriate to name the women's federation organization the Democratic Women's Federation. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of our country have already won the victory of the bourgeois democratic revolution. From the Second National Women's Congress in 1953 to the present, women in our country, together with the people of the whole country, have basically completed the socialist revolution, a brand-new socialist system has been established, the social roots that oppressed women have been permanently eradicated, women in our country have been liberated, and equality between men and women has been achieved. According to this new situation and the wishes of women across the country, the general principles of the new draft constitution stipulate that the task of the women's federation is to "unite and educate women across the country to actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland, and rely on the masses to organize social forces to serve the women masses." According to this new situation and task, the Democratic Women's Federation should be changed to the All-China Women's Federation.

    The change in the name of the women's federation is due to the change in the tasks of the women's federation organization. As for the democratic system and democratic life within the women's federation organization, there are clear provisions in the current constitution, and the principle of democracy has always been observed in the actual work and organizational life of the women's federation. Our country implements a socialist democratic system. Our democracy belongs to the vast majority of the people, belongs to the working people and women of all ethnic groups, and belongs to all people who support socialism and love the country. With the development of our country's socialist cause, the democratic rights of the people are expanding and are being fully guaranteed. This spirit of expanding the democratic rights of the people and improving democratic life is also fully reflected in the new draft constitution of the women's federation. Article 1 of the first chapter of the new draft constitution clearly stipulates that the women's federation is organized by women with civil rights based on the principle of voluntariness, which is also a reflection of the people's freedom of assembly and association rights stipulated in the Constitution. Moreover, the general principles of the new draft constitution stipulate that women's federation organizations at all levels implement the principle of democratic centralism, and in order to better implement this principle, specific provisions are made in other chapters, all of which are for the purpose of further improving and expanding the democratic life of the women's federation organization.

    (II)

    In the general principles of the new draft constitution, it is clearly stipulated that the women's federation organization should adhere to the mass line, and this spirit is also embodied in other relevant articles. Due to the teachings of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the women's federation organization has always emphasized adhering to the mass line, which is a fundamental issue in the work of the women's federation organization. Especially at present, in order to more widely unite the strength of the women masses, realize the principle of building the country diligently and thriftily, and managing households diligently and thriftily, and make more contributions to the socialist cause, emphasizing adhering to the mass line is of particularly great significance. Moreover, since the national liberation, we have gained some new experiences and understandings in using the working method of the mass line, and in order for women's federation cadres to consciously master and apply these experiences, it is necessary to focus on explaining this aspect.

    The women's federation organization has always emphasized serving the women masses wholeheartedly, cultivating the style of sharing weal and woe with the masses, closely contacting and relying on the masses, and implementing the method of "focusing on going deep, accumulating experience, and guiding work." It is precisely because we have adhered to the mass line that many of our tasks have been successful. For example, in the land reform and other democratic reform movements, as well as in mobilizing and organizing women to participate in the production movement centered on cooperativization, many women cadres ate, lived, and worked with the masses, consulted with the masses on matters, learned from the masses and taught the masses, carefully understood the ideological demands of the masses, and helped the masses overcome various difficulties, thereby improving women's awareness and production enthusiasm, and women cadres made intimate friends with women masses, and the women's federation became the women masses' own organization. For example, the promotion and implementation of the "Five Goods" and the publicity and implementation of the Marriage Law movement, all those who did well publicized typical examples among the masses, and through mutual help and mutual inspiration among the masses, and through the masses' own personal experiences, implementation was carried out on the basis of the masses' conscious voluntariness, in order to achieve universal awareness and in-depth hearts. For example, the successful examples of the development of urban and rural childcare in recent years also show that it is because they implemented starting from the actual needs of the masses, according to the living standards and requirements of the masses, relying on the strength of the masses, and organizing simple and flexible childcare organizations suitable for the masses, that they were welcomed by the masses. It has been proven in various tasks that those who pay attention to cultivating a large number of backbones and activists among the masses, and establish "models" and banners among the masses, can widely drive the women masses through them and give play to the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of women. In terms of guiding work, some local women's federations have explored more successful experiences based on their own practice. That is, implement overall planning and comprehensive consideration for various tasks, make reasonable arrangements, grasp key issues, leading cadres personally take action, purposefully go deep into the masses, conduct typical investigations, and then carefully study and analyze, absorb and summarize the opinions and experiences of the women masses, and use them to guide work, and repeatedly and continuously revise and supplement them in practice. In this way, the guidance of work can conform to the actual situation of the women masses. Those who can carry out work in accordance with the above spirit and methods, the women's federation organization can closely contact the masses, women cadres and activists can grow in large numbers, and be continuously trained and improved, and women's work can be carried out vigorously.

    I listed the above successful examples and experiences, not to say that the All-China Women's Federation and women's federation organizations at all levels have no problems in implementing the mass line, no. In fact, it is still implemented very poorly, and there are still bureaucratic styles of being divorced from the masses and divorced from reality to varying degrees. Some leading cadres of the women's federation are high above, rarely go deep into the grassroots, do not get close to the masses, do not understand the real situation of the women masses, lack research on the experience of the masses, and therefore the guidance of work does not have sufficient basis, and when implementing the resolutions of the Party and the higher-level women's federation, they cannot combine the local actual situation to put forward specific and feasible opinions, and often blindly and mechanically copy them. Some women's federation organizations and cadres have also fostered an administrative command style. Sometimes, they pay more attention to assigning tasks to the masses from top to bottom, and do not pay enough attention to understanding the demands of the masses from bottom to top, reflecting the opinions of the masses, and combining the requirements for the masses to complete the central tasks with the vital interests of the women masses. The political and ideological work for the masses is not frequent enough, not deep enough, and there are still general problems. The propaganda and explanation work aimed at the ideological characteristics of women to enlighten the masses to consciously complete the tasks is still done poorly.

    In recent years, in the practice of actual work, most women cadres have made great progress in going deep into and contacting the masses; but it should also be seen that the ideological style of arrogance and complacency, greed for ease and comfort, unwillingness to go deep into the masses, and unwillingness to study diligently is still growing in some women's federation cadres.

    If the above-mentioned phenomena are not overcome and allowed to develop, it will lead us to be divorced from the masses, which is very dangerous. In order to effectively overcome these shortcomings, the new draft constitution has made clear provisions for adhering to the mass line. However, relying solely on these provisions cannot automatically solve the problem, and women's federation cadres at all levels across the country need to carefully examine their ideological style in this rectification movement, and take the following measures in actual work.

    (1) Women's federation cadres at all levels across the country should actively participate in the rectification movement, study Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people, deeply understand the spirit of it, clarify the attitude that mass organizations should take in handling contradictions among the people and the role that they should play, establish the concept of serving the women masses wholeheartedly, and implement the working method of coming from the masses and going to the masses.

    (2) Improve the working methods of the women's federation organs. Leading cadres of women's federations at all levels should be good at grasping key issues, arrange the work of each period well, simplify institutions and levels, overcome the style of bureaucracy; every year, they should be determined to take enough time to contact the masses, carry out mass activities, go deep into the grassroots, conduct serious investigations and research, and learn to summarize the experience of the masses, put our work guidance on a solid and reliable basis, so as to more effectively play the role of the women's federation.

    (III)

    The women's federation organization has always been established according to the principle of democratic centralism. Democracy and centralism are two closely combined and inseparable aspects. The purpose of promoting democracy and expanding democratic life is to more effectively concentrate the wisdom of the broad masses of women, unite the strength of the women masses, and better complete the tasks of the women's federation organization. The new draft constitution has made some specific provisions based on the experience of the women's federation organization in implementing this principle in recent years.

      (1) It is stipulated that the leading organs at all levels are generated by election, and the highest authority of the women's federation is the National Women's Congress, and the local is the Women's Congress at all levels, and during the adjournment of the Congress, it is the executive committee of the women's federation at all levels. It also stipulates the time limit for the convening of women's congresses at all levels. After this draft constitution is adopted by the congress, women's federations at all levels should follow the regulations and hold congresses on schedule.

    In addition, it is also stipulated that during the adjournment of the Women's Congresses at all levels, the executive committees of the Women's Federations at all levels can convene representative meetings as needed, so as to promptly listen to the opinions of women masses from all aspects, enrich the democratic life of the Women's Federation and expand the scope of unity.

      (2) In the relationship between the upper and lower levels of the women's federation organization, in the relationship between the women's federation organization and the masses, in addition to the same provisions as the current constitution that "lower-level organizations are subordinate to higher-level organizations," it is also stipulated that "leading organs at all levels of the women's federation must often listen to and seriously handle the opinions, demands, criticisms and suggestions of lower-level organizations and women masses." It is also stipulated that the national leading organs and local leading organs at all levels of the Women's Federation must fully develop democracy, often carry out criticism and self-criticism, and strengthen collective leadership, etc.

    (3) It is stipulated that women's federation organizations at all levels implement a system that combines collective leadership and individual responsibility.

    The above provisions will have a good effect on strengthening the collective leadership of the Women's Federation, enlivening and improving the democratic life of the Women's Federation organization, further strengthening the relationship between the upper and lower levels of the Women's Federation, strengthening the connection between the Women's Federation and the masses, and effectively overcoming bureaucracy.

    (4) The powers of the executive committees of the National Women's Federation and the local Women's Federations are specifically stipulated, and the powers of the presidium and secretariat of the National Women's Federation are stipulated.

    The reason why the new draft constitution stipulates that the National Women's Federation should set up a presidium and not a standing committee is because the role of the presidium is to focus on implementing collective leadership on major issues of the Women's Federation's work and to entrust the secretariat to handle the daily work. This is more in line with the actual situation of the National Women's Federation and facilitates strengthening the leadership of women's work.

    (IV)

    The new draft constitution, on the basis of summarizing past experience, clearly affirms the system of grassroots women's federation organizations implementing representatives contacting the masses. The new draft constitution stipulates that the representatives of the women's congresses of townships (towns) and streets implement a permanent system. In order to better play the role of representatives in contacting the masses, the rights and obligations of the representatives are stipulated. In addition to forming the highest authority of the township (town) and street women's federation—the township (town) and street women's congress, during the adjournment of the grassroots women's congress, they work under the leadership of the grassroots women's federation and maintain regular contact with the women masses who elected them. They have the obligation to reflect the opinions and demands of the women masses, convey and explain the resolutions and calls of the women's federation to the women masses, and lead the women masses to perform tasks; they have the right to make criticisms and suggestions on the work of the women's federation and implement supervision. The new draft constitution also stipulates that street and township (town) women's federations can convene women's representative meetings by region or production organization according to work needs, so as to promptly reflect the opinions of the women masses and summarize and exchange experiences.

    The new draft constitution stipulates the units where grassroots women's federation organizations are established. In rural areas, the township is the basic unit of political power. Therefore, grassroots women's federation organizations should be established in rural areas with the township as the unit, so as to obtain the support of the grassroots political power and cooperate with each other. As for the forms and activities of women's organizations below the township, the local women's federation can stipulate them according to the establishment of local agricultural production cooperatives and work needs, and the constitution does not make uniform stipulations. In cities, the basic unit of mass activities is generally the neighborhood committee, but because the jurisdiction size and population of neighborhood committees and street offices in various cities vary, the local women's federation can handle them flexibly according to the local situation.

    The new draft constitution stipulates that representatives are voluntarily elected by women with civil rights, and attention should be paid to the broadness of representatives during the election. In urban streets, in addition to the majority of family women representatives from various ethnic groups and strata, it should also include women representatives working in street nurseries, kindergartens, health stations, primary schools, etc., including scattered professional women representatives such as small vendors and small handicraft workers. In rural areas, in addition to women members of agricultural cooperatives being the main representatives, it should also include childcare workers and educators in rural nurseries (groups), kindergartens (teams), primary schools, etc., as well as medical staff such as midwives and health station workers, staff of supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives, and women representatives from other aspects. Among the women members of agricultural cooperatives, not only should attention be paid to women who often participate in collective labor in agricultural cooperatives, but also rural family women who do not often participate in collective labor should be taken care of. This is done in order to make it easier for grassroots women's representative meetings to contact and unite women masses from all aspects.

    The new draft constitution makes clear provisions for the tasks of township (town) and street women's federation organizations. The first task is: "Unite and educate the women masses to implement the policies and laws of the Party and the government, and implement the resolutions and instructions of the higher-level women's federation organizations." The grassroots women's federation has always carried out work under the leadership of the Party, and has always played an assistant role in implementing the policies and laws of the government. Continuing to play this role is of great significance for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. At present, the vast majority of rural women have joined agricultural production cooperatives, and urban family women have joined the organizations of neighborhood committees. In implementing the policies and laws of the government and completing various tasks, urban and rural grassroots political power and relevant organizations have made unified arrangements and mobilization for women. When the women's federation organization unites women to complete these tasks, in addition to making some necessary appeals to women, it generally does not need to make repeated mobilization arrangements. Its role is mainly to conduct in-depth and meticulous ideological work aimed at the characteristics of women, and to pay attention to assisting women in solving the special problems and difficulties encountered in completing these tasks. The higher-level women's federation should guide the cadres of the grassroots women's federation to understand mutual support and close cooperation with relevant parties to give play to the special role of women's organizations. As for the implementation of the resolutions and instructions of the higher-level women's federation organizations, the grassroots women's federation should also strive for the help of relevant parties. No further explanation is given here.

    The second task is to reflect the opinions and demands of women, protect the rights of women and children, and promote the welfare of women and children. With regard to carrying out the welfare of women and children, the most important thing is to rely on and use the strength of the masses themselves, carry out mutual assistance and mutual aid, and in the spirit of diligence and thrift in running all undertakings, run some simple and easy-to-implement women's and children's welfare facilities that meet the needs of the masses. Secondly, grassroots women's organizations should always pay attention to cooperating with, assisting, and supervising relevant organizations such as agricultural cooperatives, neighborhood committees, and street offices to implement the provisions for protecting the rights and welfare of women and children. It is necessary to educate grassroots cadres to understand that they should adopt the spirit of consultation and cooperation with relevant departments and solve problems according to actual possibilities; however, for some units that adopt a bureaucratic attitude of delaying and ignoring problems that should be solved and can be solved, they should also be criticized.

    The third task is to organize the self-education of the masses and mobilize women to participate in learning. The grassroots Party, government organs, and other mass organizations have already carried out socialist ideological education uniformly among men and women, and uniformly organized the political, cultural, and technical learning of the masses. In addition to cooperating with relevant organizations to mobilize women to participate in learning, the township (town) and street women's federation should focus on organizing the self-education of the masses, often publicize and commend some good examples, organize role models to share their experiences, and organize small-scale symposiums for the masses to inspire and educate each other with their own personal experiences. Many urban and rural grassroots women's organizations have accumulated a lot of good experience in this regard, and this experience should be further promoted in the future.

    The fourth task is to cultivate and improve the cadres and activists of women's work. Now, except for a few remote areas and some ethnic minority areas, street and township women's federation organizations have spread throughout urban and rural areas across the country. A large number of grassroots women's work cadres and activists have been cultivated in the work activities of the grassroots women's federation. They are generally hardworking and simple and have contact with the masses. They are also responsible for women's work tasks in the busy labor of participating in production and managing housework. There are often some difficulties in the work. In addition to the care and help given by the higher-level women's federation, frequent cultivation and help mainly rely on the township and street women's federation. This is to promote grassroots work cadres and activists to strengthen training in their work. When there are achievements, encourage each other; when there are difficulties, help each other and overcome them together.

    Grassroots work is the foundation of the Women's Federation's work. Going deep into the grassroots, going deep into the masses, and going deep into reality are the keys to doing all the work of the Women's Federation well. Women's Federations at all levels should often go deep into the grassroots, not only to advanced grassroots but also to general and backward grassroots. Not only arrange work tasks from top to bottom, but, more importantly, go deep and meticulously to understand their implementation of the work and problems, specifically teach them the methods of carrying out the work, and help them sum up experience and do a good job. There should not be too many or too high demands on the grassroots women's congress and various activities and work of the grassroots women's federation, and attention should be paid to not affecting their production and life.

    (V)

    Chapter 5 of the new draft constitution is about the provisions for group members. In the future, the Women's Federation will strengthen ties with women's social groups that have joined the Women's Federation organization, unite them under the socialist principle, and connect and educate the women of their subordinate organizations through them to better play an active role for the motherland and the socialist cause. Female employees in industrial and mining enterprises, institutions, and groups are uniformly led by their respective organizations, and their problems in work, production, learning, and life are also uniformly solved by their respective organizations. However, they still need the Women's Federation organization to give care and support in some special issues. Therefore, the new draft constitution stipulates that if industrial and mining enterprises, institutions, and groups establish women's organizations according to needs and voluntarily join the Women's Federation, they can be regarded as group members of the Women's Federation, so that the Women's Federation can establish a certain connection with them, understand their opinions and demands, and give them necessary support.

    The new draft constitution can only make provisions for some of the main issues of the Women's Federation organization, and there are some issues that are not specifically provided for in the constitution. For example, the urban district women's federations, because the situation of various cities, large, medium, and small, is different, and the establishment of districts is also different, can only be stipulated by the provincial and municipal women's federations according to the specific local situation. Other issues not included in the new draft constitution can also be specifically stipulated by the local women's federations based on the principles of the constitution and starting from the actual situation.

    The economic and cultural development of various ethnic minority areas across the country is very unbalanced, the development of work also has priorities, and the degree of mass mobilization is also inconsistent. Therefore, the women's organizations in various ethnic minority areas can make supplementary provisions or formulate separate constitutions in accordance with the principles of this constitution and in combination with the characteristics of the region and ethnicity.

    Fellow representatives, the above is the explanation on the new draft constitution. The new draft constitution affirms the good experience in our organizational construction and makes new additions and amendments to the shortcomings and problems existing in our organization. I believe that as long as we work diligently under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and under the supervision of all women, implement the tasks put forward by this congress, strengthen organizational construction in accordance with the new constitution, and closely contact the women masses, our Women's Federation organization can definitely play its important role, unite women across the country and the people of the whole country to adhere to the principle of building the country diligently and thriftily, and managing households diligently and thriftily, and make contributions to building a socialist industrialized country and creating our better future.

    Finally, I suggest that the congress adopt the draft constitution of the All-China Women's Federation.

　　关于中华人民共和国妇女联合会章程（草案）的报告
　　1957年9月10日在中国妇女第三次全国代表大会上
　　曹冠群
　　各位代表：
    讨论和通过中华人民共和国妇女联合会章程，是我们这次大会的一个重要议程。根据新的形势所提出来的新任务和全国各级妇联组织发展的需要，在总结了几年来妇联组织建设经验的基础上，把现行的“中华全国民主妇女联合会章程”扩充修改为中华人民共和国妇女联合会各级组织统一的章程。这个章程草案在提交大会之前，曾经发给各省、自治区、中央直辖市和某些县、市（区）妇联组织，以及有关团体进行过讨论，并且吸收了大家的意见作了修改。
    新的章程草案比现行章程有了很多的扩充和重要的修改。在总则部分，根据新的形势规定了妇联组织的新的方针任务，规定了妇联的组织路线、组织原则、领导作风和基本工作方法。在其他各章，对妇联基层组织、地方各级妇联组织和妇联的全国领导机关以及团体会员等都作了具体的规定。现在，我就以下问题作一些说明。
    （一）
    新的章程草案与现行章程第一个重要的区别，就是关于妇联组织名称的改变。即以中华人民共和国妇女联合会作为全国各级妇女联合会的总称。全国领导机关的名称由原来的“中华全国民主妇女联合会”改为中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会；地方组织的名称，从原来的某某地方民主妇女联合会，改为某某地方妇女联合会。所以要这样改变，正如大家所了解的，我国目前形势和全国妇女的任务，已经同1949年召开第一次全国妇女代表大会时根本不相同了，并且同第二次全国妇女代表大会的时候相比，也有了根本的变化。在1949年召开第一次全国妇女代表大会的时候，全国还没有完全解放，中华人民共和国还没有成立，当时，还是处在新民主主义革命阶段，所以第一次妇女代表大会确定妇联的任务是：团结全国各民族各阶层妇女大众和全国人民一起，把反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的斗争进行到底，完全肃清国民党反动的残余势力，为建设统一的人民民主共和国，为完成新民主主义革命而奋斗；并努力争取实现男女平等、妇女解放。根据当时的形势和任务，妇联组织主要是团结一切为民主革命而奋斗的妇女。那时，把妇联组织的名称定为民主妇女联合会，是适合当时的情况的。1949年中华人民共和国成立以后，我国人民在中国共产党领导下，已经取得了资产阶级民主革命的胜利。从1953年第二次全国妇女代表大会到现在，我国妇女和全国人民一道，已经基本上完成了社会主义革命，一个崭新的社会主义制度已经建立起来了，压迫妇女的社会根源已经被永远铲除了，我国妇女已经获得解放，男女平等已经实现。根据这种新的形势和全国妇女的愿望，新章程草案的总则中规定妇联的任务是“团结和教育全国妇女积极参加祖国的社会主义建设，并且依靠群众，组织社会力量为妇女群众服务。”根据这种新的形势和任务，应该把民主妇联改为中华人民共和国妇女联合会。
    妇联名称的改变是由于妇联组织任务的变化而改变的。至于妇联组织内部的民主制度和民主生活，在现行的章程中已有明确的规定，而且在妇联的实际工作和组织生活中，也是一贯地遵守民主原则的。我们国家实行的是社会主义的民主制度。我们的民主是属于最大多数人民的，是属于各族劳动人民和妇女的，是属于一切拥护社会主义和爱国人民的。随着我国社会主义事业的发展，人民的民主权利日益扩大并且日益得到充分的保障。这种扩大人民民主权利和健全民主生活的精神，在妇联新的章程草案中也得到了充分的体现。新章程草案第一章第一条明确规定妇联是由有公民权的妇女根据自愿原则组织起来的，这也是宪法上所规定的人民群众有集会结社的自由权利的体现。而且在新章程草案的总则中规定了各级妇联组织均实行民主集中制的原则，为了更好地贯彻执行这一原则，并且在其他各章中作出了具体的规定，这都是为了进一步健全和扩大妇联组织的民主生活。
　　（二）
    在新的章程草案的总则中，明确规定了妇联组织应当坚持群众路线，而且在其他有关的条文中也贯串了这一精神。由于中国共产党和毛主席的教导，妇联组织历来都是强调坚持群众路线的，这是妇联组织工作中的根本问题。特别是在目前，为了更广泛地团结妇女群众的力量，实现勤俭建国、勤俭持家的方针，为社会主义事业作出更多的贡献，强调坚持群众路线，就有特别重大的意义。而且，自全国解放以来，我们在运用群众路线的工作方法方面，又取得了一些新的体会和经验，为了使妇联干部能自觉地掌握和运用这些经验，需要在这方面着重地加以说明。
    妇联组织一贯强调全心全意为妇女群众服务，养成与群众同甘共苦的作风，密切联系群众和依靠群众，贯彻“重点深入，积累经验，指导工作”的方法。正是因为我们坚持了群众路线，所以我们的许多工作才取得了胜利。例如我们在土地改革等各项民主改革运动以及动员组织妇女参加以合作化为中心的生产运动中，许多妇女干部与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，有事同群众商量，
  向群众学习又教导群众，细心体会群众的思想要求，帮助群众克服各种困难，从而提高了妇女的觉悟和生产积极性，妇女干部同妇女群众交了知心朋友，妇联成为妇女群众自己的组织。又如宣传推行“五好”和宣传贯彻婚姻法运动，凡是作得好的，都是宣传群众中的典型事例，经过群众的相互帮助和相互启发，通过群众自己的切身体会，在群众自觉自愿的基础上贯彻执行，才做到了家喻户晓和深入人心的。再如近几年来，城乡托儿事业发展成功的事例，也说明是由于贯彻了从群众的实际需要出发，按照群众的生活水平和要求，依靠群众的力量，举办适合群众的简便灵活的托儿组织，才受到了群众欢迎的。在各种工作中证明，凡是注意大量地培养群众中的骨干和积极分子，在群众中树立“样板”和旗帜，就能通过她们广泛地带动妇女群众，发挥广大妇女群众的社会主义积极性。在指导工作方面，有些地区的妇联根据亲身的实践，摸索出了比较成功的经验。这就是对各项工作实行统筹兼顾，合理安排，抓住关键性的问题，由主要负责干部亲自动手，有目的地深入群众，进行典型调查，然后经过仔细研究分析，吸取和总结妇女群众的意见和经验，用以指导工作，并且在实践中反复不断地进行修正和补充。这样，对工作的指导就能符合妇女群众的实际。凡能按照上述的精神和方法进行工作的，妇联组织就能密切联系群众，妇联干部和积极分子就能大批生长，并且不断地得到培养和提高，妇女工作就能蓬蓬勃勃的开展。
    我列举以上成功的事例和经验，并不是说全国妇联和各级妇联组织在贯彻执行群众路线方面都没有问题了，不是的。实际上还执行得很差，还不同程度地存在着脱离群众和脱离实际的官僚主义作风。妇联的有些领导干部高高在上，很少深入基层，不大接近群众，对妇女群众的真实情况不大了解，对群众的经验缺乏研究，因而对工作的指导，没有充足的根据，在执行党和上级妇联决议的时候，不能结合当地的实际情况提出具体可行的意见，往往盲目机械的照搬。有些妇联组织和干部还滋长了行政命令的作风。有时偏重于从上而下的给群众布置任务，对于自下而上的体会群众的要求，反映群众的意见，把要求群众完成中心任务同妇女群众的切身利益相结合，还注意得不够。对群众的政治思想工作不够经常，不够深入，还存在着一般化的毛病，针对妇女的思想特点进行宣传解释工作，以启发群众自觉地完成任务，还作得较差。
    近几年来，在实际工作的锻炼中，大多数妇女干部在深入联系群众方面是有很大进步的；但也应当看到骄傲自满、贪图安逸、不愿深入群众、不愿刻苦钻研的思想作风，在某些妇联干部中也还是有所滋长的。
    上述这些现象，如果不加以克服，任其发展，就会使我们脱离群众，这是十分危险的。为了有效地克服这些缺点，新章程草案对于坚持群众路线作了明确的规定。但是，仅仅依靠这些规定，并不能自动地解决问题，还需要全国各级妇联干部在这次整风运动中，认真检查自己的思想作风，并且在实际工作中采取以下措施。
    （1）全国各级妇联干部应当积极参加整风运动，学习毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的指示，深刻领会其中的精神，明确群众团体在处理人民内部矛盾中应当采取的态度和应当发挥的作用，建立全心全意为妇女群众服务的观点，贯彻执行从群众中来到群众中去的工作方法。
    （2）改善妇联机关的工作方法。各级妇联的领导干部要善于抓住关键性的问题，很好地安排各个时期的工作，简化机构与层次，克服事务主义的作风；每年要决心拿出足够的时间接触群众，开展群众活动，深入基层，认真进行调查研究，学习总结群众的经验，把我们的工作指导放在切实可靠的基础上，以便更有效地发挥妇联的作用。
    （三）
    妇联组织一贯是根据民主集中制的原则建立起来的。民主和集中是密切结合不可分割的两个方面。发扬民主、扩大民主生活的目的，正是为了更有效地集中广大妇女群众的智慧，团结妇女群众的力量，更好地完成妇联组织的任务。新章程草案根据妇联组织几年来执行这一原则的经验，作了一些具体的规定。
      （1）规定了各级领导机关由选举产生，妇联的最高权力机关是全国妇女代表大会，地方是各级妇女代表大会，在代表大会闭幕期间是各级妇联执行委员会。并且规定了各级妇女代表大会召开的期限。在这个章程草案经大会通过后，各级妇联应该遵照规定，按期举行代表大会。
    此外，还规定了在各级妇女代表大会闭幕期间，各级妇联的执行委员会可以按照需要召开代表会议，以便及时地听取各方面妇女群众的意见，充实妇联的民主生活和扩大团结面。
      （2）在妇联组织的上下级关系中，在妇联组织同群众的关系中，除了和现行章程同样地规定了“下级组织服从上级组织”外，还规定了“妇联各级领导机关必须经常听取并且认真处理下级组织和妇女群众的意见、要求、批评和建议”。并且规定妇联全国领导机关和各级地方领导机关，必须充分发扬民主，经常开展批评和自我批评，加强集体领导等等。
    （3）规定了各级妇联组织实行集体领导和个人负责相结合的制度。
    以上这些规定对于加强妇联的集体领导，活跃并健全妇联组织的民主生活，进一步密切上下级妇联之间的关系，密切妇联同群众的联系，有效地克服官僚主义，都将发生良好的作用。
    （4）具体规定了全国妇联和地方妇联的执行委员会的职权，规定了全国妇联主席团和书记处的职权。
    新章程草案所以规定全国妇联设主席团，不设常务委员会，是因为主席团这个组织的作用，是着重在妇联工作的重大问题上实行集体领导，把日常工作交由书记处去办理。这样就更切合全国妇联的实际情况，便于加强对妇女工作的领导。
　　（四）
    新章程草案在总结过去经验的基础上，明确地肯定妇联基层组织实行代表联系群众的制度。新章程草案规定乡（镇）和街道的妇女代表大会的代表实行常任制，为了更好地发挥代表联系群众的作用，规定了代表的权利和义务。她们除了组成乡（镇）和街道妇联的最高权力机关——乡（镇）和街道的妇女代表大会外，在基层妇女代表大会闭幕期间，她们在基层妇联的领导下进行工作，固定联系选举她们的妇女群众。她们有反映妇女群众的意见、要求，向妇女群众传达和解释妇联的决议号召，带领妇女群众执行任务的义务；有对妇联工作提出批评和建议、实行监督的权利。新章程草案还规定了街道、乡（镇）妇联可以根据工作需要，按地区或生产组织分片召开妇女代表会议，以便及时反映妇女群众的意见，总结和交流经验。
    新章程草案对基层妇联组织建立的单位作了规定。在农村，乡是政权的基层单位，因此，基层妇联组织在农村应该以乡为单位建立，以便取得基层政权的支持和相互配合。至于乡以下的妇女组织的形式和活动，可由地方妇联根据当地农业生产合作社建立的状况和工作需要规定，章程上不作统一规定。在城市，群众活动的基本单位一般是在居民委员会，但因各城市居民委员会和街道办事处的辖区大小、人口多少有所不同，地方妇联可以根据当地情况变通办理。
    新章程草案规定代表由有公民权的妇女自愿选举产生，在选举时应当注意到代表的广泛性。在城市街道除各民族各阶层的家庭妇女代表占多数外，还应该包括在街道托儿站、幼儿园、保健站、小学校等单位工作的妇女代表，包括小商小贩、小手工业者等零散的职业妇女代表。在农村，除以农业社女社员代表为主外，同样也应该包括农村托儿所（组）、幼儿园（队）、小学校等保教人员和接生员、卫生站等医务工作人员，供销社信用社的工作人员以及其他方面的妇女代表。在农业社女社员当中，不仅要注意经常参加农业社集体劳动的妇女，也应该照顾不经常参加集体劳动的农村家庭妇女。这样做是为了使基层妇女代表会更便于联系、团结各方面的妇女群众。
    新章程草案对于乡（镇）、街道妇联组织的任务做了明确的规定。第一项任务是：“团结和教育妇女群众贯彻执行党和政府的政策、法令，执行上级妇联组织的决议、指示”。基层妇联一直是在党的领导下进行工作的，在贯彻执行政府的政策法令方面一贯起着助手的作用。继续发挥这种作用，对于巩固人民民主专政是有很大意义的。目前，农村妇女绝大多数都参加了农业生产合作社，城市家庭妇女都参加了居民委员会的组织。在贯彻执行政府的政策法令、完成各项任务方面，城乡基层政权和有关组织都向妇女作了统一的布置和动员。妇联组织在团结妇女完成这些任务时，除了向妇女进行一些必要的号召外，一般的不须再作重复的动员布置。它的作用主要是针对妇女的特点，进行深入细致的思想工作，并且注意协助妇女解决在完成这些任务中遇到的特殊问题和困难。上级妇联要引导基层妇联的干部懂得同有关方面互相支持，密切配合，发挥妇女组织的特殊作用。至于执行上级妇联组织的决议、指示，基层妇联也应争取有关方面的帮助。这里不再作解释。
    第二项任务是反映妇女的意见、要求，保护妇女儿童的权利，推进妇女儿童福利事业。关于开展妇女儿童福利事业方面，最主要的是依靠并运用群众自己的力量，开展互助、互济，本着勤俭办一切事业的方针，举办一些简便易行切合群众需要的妇女儿童福利设施。其次，基层妇女组织要经常注意配合、协助并且监督农业社、居委会、街道办事处等有关组织，贯彻执行保护妇女儿童的各项权利、福利的规定。要教育基层干部懂得，应当采取同有关部门协商合作的精神，根据实际可能解决问题；但是对于某些单位把应当解决而又可能解决的问题，采取拖延不理的官僚主义态度，也要提出批评。
    第三项任务是组织群众的自我教育，动员妇女参加学习。基层的党、政机关和其他群众组织，已经在男女群众中统一进行了社会主义的思想教育，统一组织群众的政治、文化、技术学习。乡（镇）、街妇联除了配合有关组织，动员妇女参加学习外，应该着重组织群众的自我教育，要经常宣传和表扬一些好的典型，组织模范人物现身说法，组织小型的座谈会，由群众以自己的切身体会互相启发，互相教育。不少城乡基层妇女组织，在这方面已经积累了很多好的经验，今后应当进一步推广这些经验。
    第四项任务是培养提高妇女工作干部和积极分子。现在除少数边远地区和某些少数民族地区外，街道、乡妇联组织已经遍布全国城乡各地，在基层妇联的工作活动中已经培养了数量众多的基层妇女工作干部和积极分子。她们一般的都是艰苦朴素、同群众有联系的。她们在参加生产、操持家务的繁忙劳动中还担负着妇女工作的任务，工作中常常会有一些困难，除上级妇联给予关怀帮助外，经常的培养、帮助，主要是依靠乡，街妇联。这就是提倡基层工作干部、积极分子在工作中加强锻炼，有了成绩，互相勉励；有了困难，互相帮助，共同克服。
    基层工作是妇联工作的基础。深入基层深入群众深入实际是妇联作好一切工作的关键。各级妇联应当经常地深入基层，不仅到先进的基层，而且要到一般的和落后的基层。不只是从上而下的布置工作任务，而且，更重要的是深入细致地去了解她们执行工作的情况和问题，具体教给她们进行工作的办法，帮助她们总结经验，做好工作。对基层妇女代表大会和基层妇联的各项活动和工作都不宜要求过多、过高，要注意到不要影响她们的生产和生活。
    （五）
    新章程草案的第五章是关于团体会员的规定。今后妇联要加强同加入妇联组织的妇女社会团体的联系，在社会主义原则下团结她们，通过她们联系、教育所属组织的妇女，更好地为祖国、为社会主义事业发挥积极的作用。工矿、企业、机关、团体等单位的女职工已由所在的组织统一领导，她们的工作、生产、学习、生活中的问题也由所在组织统一解决。但她们在某些特殊问题方面还需要妇联组织予以关怀支持。因此，新章程草案规定工矿、企业、机关、团体等单位如根据需要建立了妇女组织，并且自愿加入妇联的，可以作为妇联的团体会员，以便妇联同她们取得一定的联系，了解她们的意见和要求，给她们必要的支持。
    新章程草案只能对妇联组织的一些主要问题作出规定，还有一些问题在章程中是没有作具体规定的。如城市的区妇联，因为大、中、小各种城市的情况不同，区的建制也各有不同，因此，只能由省、市妇联根据当地具体情况，作出规定。其他没有包括在新章程草案之内的问题，也可由各地妇联，根据章程的原则，从实际出发作出具体规定。
    全国各少数民族地区，经济、文化发展很不平衡，工作的发展也有先后，群众发动的程度也不一致，因此在各少数民族地区的妇女组织，可以根据本章程的原则，结合本地区和民族的特点作出补充规定或另行制定章程。
    各位代表，以上就是关于新章程草案的说明。新章程草案肯定了我们组织建设中好的经验，针对我们组织中存在的缺点和问题，作了新的补充和修正。我相信只要我们在中国共产党的领导下，在全体妇女的监督之下，勤勤恳恳的工作，贯彻执行本届代表大会提出的任务，按照新的章程加强组织建设，密切联系妇女群众，我们妇联组织一定可以发挥它的重大作用，团结全国妇女和全国人民一起坚持勤俭建国、勤俭持家的方针，为建成社会主义工业化的国家，为创造我们更加美好的未来作出贡献。
    最后，我建议大会通过中华人民共和国妇女联合会章程草案。
