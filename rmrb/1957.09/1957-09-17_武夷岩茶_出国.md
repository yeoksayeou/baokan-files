    "Wuyi Rock Tea" Goes Abroad

    The well-known domestic and foreign Fujian "Wuyi Rock Tea" has recently begun to be transferred abroad to supply the needs of overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Southeast Asian countries. As of mid-August, the Jian'ou Tea Factory in Fujian Province has refined and produced more than 850 boxes of various Wuyi Rock Teas, which are currently being shipped out in a steady stream.

    Wuyi Rock Tea is produced in the Wuyi Mountain tea area of Chong'an County, Fujian Province. Wuyi Mountain has beautiful scenery, with thirty-six famous peaks and ninety-nine unique rocks, shrouded in clouds and mist. Tea trees grow around the mountains and rocks. Wuyi Rock Tea is of good quality, the tea water is brightly colored, and the aroma is mellow and clear, which is very popular among consumers at home and abroad. (Lin Qihua)

    闻名国内外的福建“武夷岩茶”，最近开始调运出国，供应香港及东南亚各国海外华侨需要。到八月中旬为止，福建省建瓯茶厂已精制出厂各类武夷岩茶八百五十多箱，目前正在源源外运。
    武夷岩茶产于福建省崇安县武夷山茶区。武夷山风景优美，拥有三十六个名峰，九十九个奇岩，云雾弥漫，茶树就生长在山岩的四周。武夷岩茶品质良好，茶水色泽鲜艳，香气醇清，深受国内外消费者的欢迎。　（林琪华）
