Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: Indian Vice President Radhakrishnan delivered a radio address to the Chinese people tonight. The full text is as follows:

    I have spent a few happy and joyful days in this beautiful city. On the eve of my departure, I would like to express my gratitude to Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese government and the people for their warm hospitality. This is an experience we will cherish.

    Thanks to your suffering and sacrifice, your efforts and struggles, you have swept away the pain and humiliation endured for generations. From what I have seen, your people have vivid aspirations, vigorous ambitions, enthusiastic action, and the ability to work hard. Disciplined enthusiasm has become part of your national spirit. I have learned a lot, and I am deeply moved by the boldness shown by your government in its efforts to improve the economic, social, and cultural conditions of the people, and the determination shown by your people in this process.

    In our own country, we are also facing the problems of social and economic reconstruction that you are solving. The people of the lower classes in the world are demanding that not only a few, but all people, can live a tolerable life. They do not recognize famine and floods, droughts, diseases, ignorance, and superstitions as inevitable evils. The mood of resignation has been replaced by hope and expectation. Modernization or perish. If we overcome poverty and raise living standards, we will add a completely new meaning to human life.

    Both of our countries believe in democracy. The principle that must be followed in a democratic society is spontaneous consensus, not forced obedience. The will of the people should be realized, and we cannot let their wishes fall through. Through mutual education, the government and the people will get closer to each other, until the interests of the rulers and the ruled become as consistent as in the ideal state in the Indian concept. The other day, when I walked past the physics building of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, I saw political issues of fundamental importance being freely discussed on the wall newspaper. One can see a strong anti-bureaucratic tone in people's minds, expressing greater freedom of thought, and one can see that the possibility of human error in human affairs is a constant factor. These characteristics are the best traditions of democracy.

    What democracy affirms is that no individual can be a law unto himself, and no regime is free from moral constraints. Democracy is governing according to moral standards. For many centuries, your civilization has been a moral civilization.

    A nation cannot exist for long once it is separated from its roots. It is like a meteor that streaks across space and disappears because it has been separated from the fire that created and nourished it. You have always accepted the precious things of the past and rejected the harmful things. All life is a transformation, adapting the old to new challenges. Even today, you are accepting what is helpful to you from other cultures and removing what is not.

    According to the spirit of Taoism, the soul should soar and merge with its infinite realm. For Confucius, humanity is God. The harmony of social life is the goal of mankind. The spirit of Buddhism is infinite compassion for the common people. The highest principle of life is that the individual should be subordinate to the public interest. Your great mentors are committed to social awareness and development.

    Your constitution allows freedom of religious belief. The study and research of various religions are encouraged. It seems that the result will negate obscurantist superstition and accept rational and ethical interpretations of the highest purpose of life.

    There is a general view that human existence is regarded as social – as a function of human economic production methods and the social relations produced by these methods. Man has different aspects: there is the biological man, there is also the social or socialized man, the political group, the member of the country or its component part – the economic man. There is also another dimension of man, that is, the isolated man who has the opportunity to change himself and become a member of a new society. Only in freedom can man discover what he truly is. Only as an individual can one feel pain and joy, can one bear responsibility, can one do good or evil. If we ignore this aspect of human nature, we turn the subjective into the objective. For freedom, objectification is both a necessary condition and a permanent threat. Humanity must limit objectification to the extent necessary for his freedom. Since his compatriots should all be equally free, each individual must submit to certain restrictions. This submission is not slavery, because it is accepted in the freedom of the spirit. A good society should lead to self-endeavor, not self-destruction.

    A modern country has the potential to use all its strength and resources to improve the lives and health of its citizens, something that seemed impossible just a few years ago. However, the scientific and technological revolution can also produce tools sufficient to destroy all human life. Now, mankind is in the midst of the unease and pain between the death of the old order and the birth of the new order. Conflict and tension pervade everywhere. After two world wars and the rise of new regimes, we have become callous, dull, and numb. Many terrible things have happened that once seemed impossible. These things are not the fault of only some people. They are caused by deep-rooted disorders that exist in our minds and hearts. What causes this situation is a tendency to objectify, a lack of brains. Disappointment in the future is an act of betrayal. We must fight to the end.

    The technological revolution helps us to see all mankind as a whole. If we look at the regions of the world where there are tensions and conflicts, such as Germany, West Asia, and Southeast Asia, we sometimes feel that people have forgotten the ideal of all people being one family and are in a madness that is often self-destructive. If we cannot control our emotions, the world will be plunged into a dark age. This has already happened in the tortuous history of mankind. We must make a choice to ensure the survival and progress of mankind. We are at a crossroads in history. We cannot reduce man to nature, and we cannot reduce history to a natural process. This is an ethical drama with one person after another participating in the performance.

    Thinking people all over the world are deeply alarmed, fearing that people will lose their spiritual strength due to their greed for material power. This spiritual power is capable of transforming human life into better social forms and more sacred inner lives. Only these forces can save mankind at this critical juncture and guide his soul to a higher realm.

    You are now building a new economic order, which will require all your energy and resources for many years to come, and this can only be done in a peaceful environment. We have no doubt that you will soon be able to make valuable contributions to civilization's efforts to build a happy human paradise on earth.

    As early as 1856, a great American president clearly elucidated the United States' policy on the entire issue of recognizing other countries. He said, "If there is a de facto government accepted by the whole people, then, no matter where the government comes from or how it is organized, and no matter how the government personnel obtain power, the established policy of the United States is to recognize it uniformly." The United Nations Organization accepts all peace-loving countries that accept and are able and willing to fulfill the obligations of the United Nations Charter as members. Some members of the United Nations have not fulfilled their obligations. World public opinion demanding the admission of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations is growing day by day. We hope and wish that the People's Republic of China will soon be able to have its due place in the United Nations Organization.

    The United Nations Charter requires us to leave the path of militarization and embark on peaceful means to resolve our differences. We must avoid even the slightest trace of pride and must recognize that mankind are all brothers and those who hurt others will hurt themselves. What happens politically, economically, and even militarily increasingly prompts us to recognize the interdependence of mankind. If there can be a period of peaceful coexistence, then every social system, every political structure, will shed its weaknesses and develop according to the principles suitable to its own conditions. In the near future, we will find that we are all members of a peaceful international family.

    Before I end my speech, I would like to mention that our two countries have had many centuries of cultural exchange without being disturbed by any political or military misfortunes. Our relationship has grown richer and richer due to each other's gifts. Nearly two thousand years ago, it was laid down by our ancestors – the Chinese and the Indians – with infinite patience and sacrifice. The road they established for the pursuit of truth, the pursuit of love and cooperation, and the overcoming of barriers of race and language should become an inspiration for the friendship of our future comrades.

    I would like to extend our best wishes to the Chinese people who are engaged in the great cause of building a new China that is free, democratic, and socialist.

    拉达克里希南发表广播演说
    新华社25日讯　印度共和国副总统拉达克里希南今晚向中国人民发表广播演说，全文如下：
    我在这个美丽的城市里，幸福和欢乐地过了几天。在我离开的前夕，我愿向毛泽东主席、中国政府和人民表示感谢，感谢他们对我们的热情款待。这是我们值得怀念的一次经历。
    由于你们的苦难和牺牲、你们的努力和奋斗，你们已经扫除了世世代代所忍受过的痛苦和屈辱，从我所见到的一点来说，你们的人民具有生动的憧憬，朝气勃勃的抱负，行动的热忱和艰苦工作的能力。有纪律的热情已经成为你们民族风气的一部分了。我学到了很多，而你们的政府在努力改善人民经济、社会和文化状况中所表现的魄力和你们人民在这当中表现的决心，使我深为感动。
    我们在自己的国家里，也面对着你们正在解决着的社会和经济方面的重建问题。世界上底层阶级的人民，正在要求不仅使少数人，而且使所有的人能够过可以容忍的生活。对于饥荒和水灾、旱灾、疾病、愚昧、迷信这些罪恶，他们不承认是不可避免的。听天由命的心情已经被希望和期待代替了。不现代化就要灭亡。如果我们克服了贫困，提高了生活水平，那么我们就会给人类生活增添一种完全新的意义。
    我们两国都是信仰民主的。民主社会中必须遵守的原则是自发的一致，而不是强迫的服从，人民的意志应该实现，我们不能使他们的愿望落空。通过相互之间的教育，政府和人民将彼此接近，一直到统治者和被统治者的利益变得像印度概念中的理想国里那样一致。那一天，当我在中国科学院物理楼门前走过的时候，我看见墙报上自由地讨论着带有根本的重要性的政治问题。从人们思想里可以看出强烈的反官僚主义的调子，表现了思想的更大的自由，可以看出在人的事务中人类犯错误的可能性是一个经常的因素。这些特色就是民主的最优良的传统。
    民主所肯定的是：任何个人都不能自成为一套法律，而没有一个政权是不受道义的束缚的。民主就是按道义的标准施政。许多世纪以来，你们的文明是道义的文明。
    一个民族，一旦同它的根基分割开以后，就不能存在很久了。这就好像一颗流星，由于它已经和原来产生它和供养他的火团分离了，就会划过空间而归于消失。你们一向接受过去的珍贵的东西，拒绝有害的东西。一切生命都是一种转化，是使旧的东西适应新的挑战。甚至在今天，你们还在从其他各种文化中接受着对你们有帮助的东西，去除没有帮助的东西。
    按照道家的精神，灵魂应当飞扬并且和它的无穷境界融合起来。对于孔子来说，人类就是上帝。社会生活的和谐是人类的目标。佛家的精神是对于普通人民的无限同情。生活的最高准则是要个人服从于公众的利益。你们伟大的导师是坚持社会觉悟和发展的。
    你们的宪法允许宗教信仰的自由。各种宗教的学习和研究受到鼓励。看起来结果会否定蒙昧主义的迷信，并接受对于生活最高目的的合理的和合乎伦理的解释。
    有一个普遍的看法，就是把人的存在当作是社会性的——当作是人的经济生产方式和由这些方式所产生的社会关系的一种机能。人具有不同的方面：有生物学上的人，也有社会的或者社会化了的人、政治集团、国家的成员或者它的组成部分——经济的人。另外还有一种人的尺度，那就是孤立的人，他有机会改变他自己，成为新社会的一员。只有在自由中，人才可能发现他真正是怎样的。只有作为个人，才会感到痛苦和欢乐，才会担负责任，才会做出好事或者坏事。如果我们忽视了人类天性的这一方面，我们就把主观变成了客观。对于自由，客观化既是必要条件，又是永久的威胁。人类必须把客观化限制到他的自由所必要的那个程度。由于他的同胞都应当一样的自由，每一个个人就必须要服从某些限制。这种服从并不是奴役，因为它是在精神的自由当中接受下来的。一个良好的社会应该导致自我奋发，而不是导致自我毁灭。
    一个现代国家有可能把它所有的力量和资源用在提高公民的生活和健康，而在几年以前，这样做，看来还是不可能的。可是，科学和技术的革命也能够产生足以消灭一切人类生命的工具。现在，人类正处在一个旧秩序死亡和新秩序产生之间的不安和痛苦中。到处弥漫着冲突和紧张。在两次世界大战和新的政权兴起以后，我们变得冷酷迟钝和麻木了。有很多一度看来不可能发生的可怕事情发生了。这些事情并不是只有某一些人才会犯的过错。它们是存在于我们的头脑和心目中的根深蒂固的错乱所造成的。造成这种情况的是一种客观化的倾向，一种缺乏脑筋的趋势。对将来的失望是一种背信的行为。我们必须奋斗到底。
    技术革命帮助我们去把全人类看成一个整体。假如我们看一看世界上那些存在着紧张和冲突的地区，例如德国、西亚和东南亚，我们有时候会感到人们已经忘记了四海一家的理想，而是处在一种往往是自我毁灭的疯狂中。假如我们不能控制我们的情感，世界就会投入一个黑暗时代中去。这已经在人类曲折的历史中发生过了。我们必须作一种抉择，以保证人类的生存和进步。我们处在历史上的一个交岔路口。我们不能把人降低成为自然，把历史降低成为一个自然过程。这是一出有一个一个的人参加演出的伦理剧。
    全世界有思想的人都深深惊恐，恐怕人们由于对物质权力的贪欲而丧失精神力量。这种精神力量是能够把人的生活变成更好的社会形式和更圣洁的内心生活的。只有这些力量能够在这危急关头拯救人类，把他的灵魂导向更高的境地。
    你们现在正在建设新的经济秩序，这将使你们在将来的许多年头里付出你们全部的精力和物力，而这也只有在和平的环境下才能够作到。我们毫不怀疑，对于文明为建设地球上的幸福的人类乐园所作的努力，你们将能够很快地作出有价值的贡献。
    早在1856年，一位伟大的美国总统就明确地阐明过美国有关承认其他国家的这一整个问题的政策。他说过“如果有了一个被全民接受的事实上的政府，那末，不论这个政府的来由或它的组织如何，也不论这个政府的人员获得权力的手段如何，美国的既定政策是一律予以承认。联合国组织接纳一切接受，并且能够和愿意执行联合国宪章的义务的爱好和平的国家为会员国。有一些联合国的成员并没有执行它们的义务。要求接纳中华人民共和国进入联合国的世界舆论是与日俱增的。我们希望并祝愿中华人民共和国将能够很快地在联合国组织内有它应有的位置。
    联合国宪章要求我们离开军事化的道路，并且着手用和平方式解决我们的分歧。我们必须避免任何一丝一毫的骄傲，必须认识到：人类都是兄弟，伤人者必伤自己。政治上，经济上，甚至军事上所发生的事情，日益促使我们认识到人类的相互依存。如果能够有一个时期的和平共处，那末，每一种社会制度，每一种政治结构，都将摆脱它的弱点，而按照适合于它本身条件的原则发展起来。在不远的将来，我们将发现我们都是和平的国际大家庭中的成员。
    在我结束我的讲话以前，我愿意提到，我们两个国家已经有了许多世纪的文化交流，而且没有遭到任何政治上或军事上的不幸事件的干扰。我们由于彼此的赠礼而越来越成长丰富我们之间的关系。在将近两千年以前，就已经由我们的祖先——中国人和印度人，以无限的耐心和牺牲精神而奠定了下来。他们为追求真理，追求爱和合作，超越种族和语言的障碍而建立起来的道路，应该成为我们将来的同志的友谊的启示。
    我愿向正在从事于建设一个自由、民主和社会主义的新中国的伟大事业的中国人民，致以我们最好的祝愿。
