    Who Should Be Faster?
    ——On the Proportional Relationship Between the Iron and Steel Industry and the Machine Manufacturing Industry
    Jing Lin
    The relationship between the iron and steel industry and the machine manufacturing industry is the most important proportional relationship within heavy industry.
    During China's First Five-Year Plan, the development of the iron and steel industry and the machine manufacturing industry, together with the adjustment of import and export trade, generally adapted to the needs of China's industrialization.
    However, from an annual perspective and from a product variety perspective, both the iron and steel industry and the machine manufacturing industry have varying degrees of imbalance between production and demand. For example, steel materials were somewhat overstocked in 1955, but extremely tight in 1956. The machine manufacturing industry had insufficient production tasks in 1954 and 1955, but grew rapidly in 1953 and 1956. In particular, the steel shortage in 1956 forced many machine factories to reduce production, and some newly built factories could not fully utilize their production capacity due to the lack of material supply.
    Seeing these situations, some comrades raised the question: Is the machine manufacturing industry developing too fast, exceeding the possibility of steel supply? Were some machine manufacturing factories built too early, resulting in a lack of production conditions, etc.? In short, many people have raised the question of whether there has been an imbalance in the proportion of machines and steel in our country.
    Regarding this issue, I think it can be analyzed from several aspects.
    First, let's look at the development speed of the machine manufacturing industry and steel materials in recent years. Taking 1952 as 100, the development speeds of the two are as follows:
    Year　　　　　　　　　1952　　　1953　　　1954　　　1955　　　1956　　　1957 (Planned)
    National Machine Industry Output Value　　100　　　154　　　202　　　220　　　405　　　388
    National Steel Output　　　　　　　　　100　　　139　　　163　　　228　　　325　　　399
    It can be seen from the above table that the development of the machine manufacturing industry is not too fast compared to the growth of steel output. In 1955 and 1957, the growth rate of steel even exceeded that of the machine manufacturing industry.
    Secondly, judging from the production level of machines in our country, it cannot be said that the machine manufacturing industry has developed too fast. The planned steel output in China in 1957 is 4.47 million tons, which is about the same as the steel output of the Soviet Union in 1932. However, the planned output of many kinds of machines in China in 1957 is far behind the output of the Soviet Union in 1932.
    Thirdly, from the perspective of investment and fixed assets in the machine manufacturing industry in recent years, the total industrial investment in China from 1953 to 1956 was approximately 19.8 billion yuan, of which 2.06 billion yuan was invested in the iron and steel industry, accounting for 10.4%; 2.55 billion yuan was invested in the machine manufacturing industry, accounting for 12.8%. The investment ratio between the iron and steel industry and the machine manufacturing industry is approximately 1:1.2. Due to the tight supply of steel raw materials and the remaining potential of the machine manufacturing industry, the investment in the machine manufacturing industry has been appropriately compressed and the investment in the iron and steel industry has been increased when compiling the 1957 plan, so that the ratio between the two has become 1:0.85.
    According to the data from the National Bureau of Statistics, in the fixed assets of the entire industry, the iron and steel industry accounted for 10% in 1952, and the machine manufacturing and metal processing industry accounted for 13.5%; by 1955, the iron and steel industry accounted for 10.6%, and the machine manufacturing and metal processing industry accounted for 12.7%.
    From this, it can be seen that the growth of investment and fixed assets in China's machine manufacturing industry is not excessive.
    Fourthly, from the perspective of meeting the needs, the self-sufficiency rate of machine equipment in my country can only reach about 60% in 1957. That is to say, 40% of the machine equipment still needs to be solved by imports. However, the self-sufficiency rate of steel has reached more than 90%, and only a few steel plates, steel pipes, large-sized steel, and alloy steel plates need to be solved by imports.
    Since the development of the machine manufacturing industry is not too fast, why did the tight supply of steel occur in 1956? I think there are several special factors in 1956, and these factors will not appear every year in the future. These factors are:
    1. The basic construction plan for 1956 was set too high. According to calculations, every 10,000 yuan of capital construction investment directly and indirectly requires 2.5 tons of steel. The investment in 1956 was about 1.5 to 2 billion yuan more, which requires 375,000 to 500,000 tons more steel.
    2. Too many agricultural tools were produced in 1956. The agricultural tools alone used 280,000 tons of steel, while the production of agricultural tools in 1955 only used 70,000 tons of steel. According to normal development, it is estimated that 150,000 tons were used more.
    3. Imports decreased and exports increased. In 1953, China imported 850,000 tons of steel and exported 10,000 tons; in 1956, steel imports decreased to 530,000 tons and exports increased to 210,000 tons. That is to say, steel resources in 1956 decreased by 520,000 tons compared to 1953.
    4. Artificial tension. According to the data from the national statistical bureau's census, the total steel inventory of various departments across the country on January 1, 1956 was 1.64 million tons, and the total steel inventory on January 1, 1957 was 1.728 million tons. That is to say, the steel inventories of various departments actually increased by 88,000 tons within 1956.
    From the overall quantity, steel can be balanced both in 1956 and 1957. The problem lies in the variety. Boiler steel plates, cold-rolled steel plates, large-sized steel, alloy steel, etc. required by the machine manufacturing industry are all insufficient. Therefore, in addition to quantity development in the future, the iron and steel industry should pay special attention to increasing variety.
    A part of the potential of the machine manufacturing factories in my country has not been brought into play in 1956 and 1957. For example, the planned total output value of the First Ministry of Machine Building in 1957 is 2.31 billion yuan, but the production capacity of the factories can reach 3 billion yuan. That is, about 20% of the production capacity is not utilized. The main reason here is also the variety issue. Generally, the growth of small and medium-sized ordinary machines has been very fast in recent years, resulting in excess production capacity. However, the heavy and precision equipment needed for national construction cannot meet the needs due to the limitations of the equipment and technical strength of the machine manufacturing factories. There is also a part of equipment that could have been manufactured, but was not manufactured due to poor organization or excessive emphasis on specialization and standardization. In the future, the machine manufacturing industry must strengthen the construction of heavy machinery and precision machinery factories on the one hand; on the other hand, it must make full use of existing factories to increase variety and manufacture products that could not be manufactured originally. ×××
    When studying the guidelines for the Second Five-Year Plan, there were two different opinions on how to arrange the proportional relationship between the machine manufacturing industry and the iron and steel industry. One opinion advocated accelerating the development of the machine manufacturing industry. If raw materials cannot keep up, materials can be imported from abroad, because importing steel is much cheaper than importing equipment. This can greatly save foreign exchange and accelerate industrialization. Another opinion advocated developing the iron and steel industry more, because it is difficult to import a large amount of steel from abroad, but it is relatively easy to import equipment. There is no danger in developing the iron and steel industry too much, and ore, pig iron, and steel can all be exported.
    In my opinion, both of these opinions have their own merits, but overemphasizing one aspect would be not entirely correct. Because our country is a country with a population of 600 million and abundant resources, we cannot build our processing industry on the basis of imported raw materials from abroad like Japan. Similarly, we cannot export raw materials and import finished machine products for a long time or even forever. Because that would make our country's economy stagnate at a backward level for a long time, the processing industry cannot develop, and it will cause difficulties in employment. At the same time, the average export price of steel is only 400 yuan per ton, while the average import price of machine equipment is more than 4,000 yuan per ton. That is to say, it takes ten tons of steel to exchange for one ton of machines, while domestically manufactured machines, calculated at cost, are only equivalent to the value of three to four tons of steel. It can be seen that taking the method of exporting raw materials and importing finished machine products for a long time is detrimental to the national construction cause.
    Then, how should the proportional relationship between the two be properly arranged? I think that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, relatively more investment should be used to build the iron and steel industry than during the First Five-Year Plan period. There are several reasons for this:
    1. At present, the production potential of machine manufacturing factories in my country is still relatively large, and the production capacity of some products is already surplus. For example, agricultural machinery, textile machinery, drilling rigs, metal cutting machine tools, small and medium-sized diesel engines, etc. all have inventory backlog at present; it is estimated that the production tasks in the next few years will not be very large, and the existing factories still have a tendency to not be fully occupied. Therefore, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, there is no need to invest in new or expanded small and medium-sized machinery manufacturing plants.
    2. The newly built machine manufacturing factories during the First Five-Year Plan period can still greatly tap their potential. At the same time, some new products and new needs can also be produced and supplied by taking some measures in the old factories with less investment without building new factories. For example, the First Ministry of Machine Building studied that the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory can mass-produce heavy gas compressors with only a slight change in design. In this way, the heavy compressor factory originally planned to be built can be abandoned.
    3. Many factories that manufacture military products can transfer a large amount of capacity to manufacture civilian products. If arranged well, these factories can produce watches, bicycles, sewing machines, cameras, hydraulic presses, motorcycles, measuring tools and cutting tools, auto parts, etc. In this way, the new construction of machine manufacturing factories can be relatively reduced.
    4. Our country can temporarily do less of some machines and solve them through international cooperation.
    5. It costs more money to build iron and steel factories, the construction time is long, and it is also restricted by resources, transportation and other aspects. Under normal circumstances, it takes seven or eight years for a large-scale iron and steel factory from the start of construction to full production. Therefore, if preparations are not made early, it is often not easy to catch up. The construction of machine manufacturing factories is relatively fast, and can generally be completed in only two or three years.
    However, the investment in the machine manufacturing industry cannot be cut too much due to the emphasis on the development of the iron and steel industry, because:
    First, the foundation of China's machine manufacturing industry is still weak, and there are still many important gaps. For example: heavy forging equipment, rolling equipment, nitrogen fertilizer equipment, cement equipment, electric locomotives, internal combustion locomotives, ocean-going ships, equipment for manufacturing man-made fibers and synthetic fibers, precision machine tools and measuring tools, various automatic control instruments and meters, etc. At the same time, most of the current factories in my country manufacture single machines, and the complete sets of equipment required for building large factories mainly rely on imports. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, we must strive to supply complete sets of equipment ourselves. In this way, the variety and quantity of machines that need to be manufactured will increase a lot. For example, in the equipment of a power station, in addition to several main engines such as boilers, turbines, and generators, various auxiliary equipment accounts for more than half of the total value, and dozens of factories need to cooperate. Therefore, if the construction of the machine manufacturing industry is too little during the Second Five-Year Plan period, new uncoordination will occur during the Third Five-Year Plan period.
    Second, the machine manufacturing industry is the leading link in the technical transformation of the national economy. If the investment in it is excessively compressed, it will inevitably affect the future technical transformation of various sectors of the national economy. At the same time, the task of developing metallurgy, coal, chemical industry, and power industry itself requires accelerating the development of the machine manufacturing industry. For example, recently when we were studying to accelerate the development of the chemical fertilizer industry, the first problem we encountered was the problem of equipment supply. The possibility of equipment supply has actually become the main limitation for the development of chemical fertilizers. Therefore, it is not appropriate to excessively weaken the machine manufacturing industry.
    Third, the machine manufacturing industry is the main user of steel products. If the development speed of the iron and steel industry and the machine manufacturing industry is too disparate, there will also be a surplus of steel materials in the future. For example, at present, we make 10,000 cars a year, and we feel it is very difficult due to the lack of thin steel plates. However, once the thin plate factory of Anshan Iron and Steel is put into production, it can produce 300,000 tons of thin steel plates a year. At that time, even if 30,000 cars are made a year, only 30,000 tons of thin plates are needed. That is to say, at a certain period, the iron and steel industry will in turn require the machine manufacturing industry to use more steel.
    Fourth, since the growth rate of agricultural products in my country will not be very fast, my country's foreign exchange will also be tight for a long time. This forces us to reduce the import of machine equipment as much as possible and try to increase the self-sufficiency rate of machine equipment. At present, the import value of machine equipment accounts for about 40% of the total imports. Importing a machine costs tens of thousands of yuan, or even hundreds of thousands of yuan, and requires a lot of soybeans and pork to exchange for it. Therefore, increasing the self-sufficiency rate of machines is an extremely serious task, and the construction of the machine manufacturing industry is still not to be ignored.

    谁应当更快一些？
    ——谈谈钢铁工业和机器制造工业的比例关系
    景林
    钢铁工业和机器制造工业的关系，是重工业内部最重要的比例关系。
    我国第一个五年计划期间，钢铁工业和机器制造工业的发展，加上进出口贸易的调剂之后，大体上是同我国工业化的需要相适应的。
    但是，从年度来看，从品种来看，则不论是钢铁工业或是机器制造工业，在生产和需要之间都存在着不同程度的不平衡情况。例如钢铁材料在1955年有些积压，1956年又十分紧张。机器制造工业在1954年1955年生产任务不足，1953年和1956年又增长很快。特别是1956年钢材紧张，许多机器工厂不得不减少生产，有些新建的工厂，由于材料供应不上，不能充分发挥生产能力。
    有些同志看到这些情况，就提出问题说，是不是机器制造工业发展得过快了，超过了钢铁供应的可能？是不是有些机器制造工厂建设得过早了，以致缺乏生产的条件等等。总之，不少人都提出，我国在机器和钢铁的比例上是否发生了失调。
    关于这个问题，我想可以从几方面来分析。
    首先，我们看看这几年来机器制造工业和钢材的发展速度。如以1952年为100，两者的发展速度如下：年度195219531954195519561957（计划）全国机器工业产值100 154202220405388全国钢材产量100139163 228325 399
    从上表可以看出，机器制造工业的发展，同钢材产量的增长比较起来，并不是过快的。1955年和1957年，钢材增长的速度还超过了机器制造工业。
    其次，从我国机器的生产水平来看，也不能说机器制造工业发展得过快了。1957年我国钢材的计划产量是四百四十七万吨，和苏联1932年钢材的产量差不多，但是我国1957年许多种机器的计划产量都大大落后于苏联1932年的产量。
    第三，从几年来机器制造工业的投资和固定资产来看。1953年到1956年的四年中，我国工业投资共计约一百九十八亿元，其中投资于钢铁工业的为二十亿六千万元，占10.4％；投资于机器制造工业的为二十五亿五千万元，占12.8％。钢铁工业和机器制造工业的投资比例是1∶1.2左右。由于钢铁原料供应紧张和机器制造工业还有些潜力，所以在编制1957年的计划时，已经适当地压缩了机器制造工业的投资，而增加了钢铁工业的投资，使两者的比例成为1∶0.85。
    根据国家统计局的资料，在全部工业的固定资产中，1952年钢铁工业占10％，机器制造和金属加工业占13.5％；到1955年，钢铁工业占10.6％，机器制造和金属加工业占12.7％。
    从此可见，我国机器制造工业的投资和固定资产的增长并不是过多的。
    第四，从满足需要的程度来看。我国机器设备的自给率，在1957年只能达到60％左右。这就是说，还有40％的机器设备要靠进口解决。但是，钢材的自给率已经达到90％以上，只有少数的钢板，钢管，大型型钢和合金钢板要靠进口解决。
    机器制造工业的发展既然不是太快，为什么又发生了1956年钢材供应紧张的情况呢？我以为1956年有若干特殊因素，这些因素不会在以后年度年年出现的。这些因素是：
    1. 1956年的基本建设计划定得偏高。据计算，每一万元基建投资，直接和间接需用钢材二点五吨。1956年投资多了约十五亿到二十亿元，就要多用钢材三十七万五千到五十万吨。
    2. 1956年农具生产得过多，仅农具一项就用了二十八万吨钢材，而1955年生产农具只用钢材七万吨，按正常发展，估计多用了十五万吨。
    3.进口减少，出口增加。1953年我国进口钢材八十五万吨，出口一万吨；1956年钢材进口减少为五十三万吨，出口增加为二十一万吨。就是说，钢材资源1956年比1953年减少了五十二万吨。
    4.人为的紧张。根据国家统计局普查的资料，1956年1月1日全国各部门钢材库存总数为一百六十四万吨，1957年1月1日钢材的库存总数为一百七十二万八千吨。就是说，各部门库存的钢材，在1956年之内反而增加了八万八千吨。
    从总的数量来看，不论1956年或1957年，钢材都是可以平衡的。问题在于品种。机器制造工业所需要的锅炉钢板、冷轧钢板、大型型钢、合金钢材等都不足。因此，钢铁工业今后除了数量上的发展以外，应当特别注意增加品种。
    我国的机器制造工厂，在1956年和1957年都还有一部分潜力没有发挥，例如第一机械工业部1957年生产总值计划为二十三亿一千万元，但工厂的生产能力可以达到三十亿元，就是，约有20％的生产能力没有利用。这里，主要也是由于品种问题。一般中小型的普通机器，这几年来增长得很快，以致生产能力过剩。但是，国家建设所需要的重型的、精密的设备，由于受到机器制造工厂设备和技术力量的限制，还不能满足需要。也有一部分设备，本来是可能制造的，由于组织得不好，或是过分地强调了专业化、正规化，因而没有制造。机器制造工业今后一方面要加强重型机械和精密机械工厂的建设；另方面必须尽量利用现有的工厂增加品种，制造原来不能制造的产品。×××
    在研究第二个五年计划的方针时，对于如何安排机器制造工业和钢铁工业的比例关系，曾经有两种不同的意见。一种意见主张加快地发展机器制造工业，如果原料跟不上，可以从国外进口材料，因为进口钢材比进口设备便宜得多，这样可以大大节省外汇，加速工业化。另一种意见主张多发展钢铁工业，因为从国外大量进口钢材是困难的，而进口设备则比较容易，钢铁工业发展得过多没有危险，矿砂、生铁、钢材都可以出口。
    我认为，这两种意见都有它一方面的道理，但是如果过分地强调一个方面就都会成为不十分正确的了。因为我国是一个有六亿人口、具有丰富资源的国家，我们不能像日本那样，把我国的加工工业建筑在国外进口原料的基础上。同样地，我们也不能长期以至永远出口原料、进口机器成品。因为那样会使我国的经济长期停滞在落后的水平上，加工工业不能发展，要造成就业的困难。同时，出口钢材平均每吨不过四百元，进口机器设备平均每吨要四千元以上，也就是说，要出口十吨钢材才能换回一吨机器，而国内制造的机器，按成本计算，不过等于三吨到四吨钢材的价值。可见，长期采取出口原料、进口机器成品的办法，是对于国家建设事业不利的。
    那末，应该如何恰当地安排两者之间的比例关系呢？我认为，在第二个五年计划期间，应当比第一个五年计划期间相对地用较多的投资来建设钢铁工业。这有以下几个理由：
    1.目前我国机器制造工厂的生产潜力还是比较大的，有些产品的生产能力已经过剩。例如农业机械，纺织机械，钻探机，金属切削机床，中小型柴油机等，目前都有积压；估计今后几年内生产任务也不会很大，现有工厂还有吃不饱的趋势。因此，在第二个五年计划期间，就不需要投资新建或扩建中小型机械的制造厂。
    2.第一个五年计划期间新建的机器制造工厂还能够大大发挥潜力。同时，有些新的产品和新的需要，也可以不必建设新的工厂，用较少的投资在老厂采取些措施，就能生产和供应。如第一机械工业部研究，太原重型机器厂只要稍稍改变设计，就可以大量制造重型的气体压缩机。这样，原来打算新建的重型压缩机厂就可以不建了。
    3.许多制造军用品的工厂，可以调出很大的能力来制造民用产品，如安排得好，这些工厂可以生产手表、自行车、缝纫机、照像机、油压机、摩托车、量具刃具、汽车配件等等。这样，就可以相对地减少机器制造工厂的新建设。
    4.有些机器我国暂时可以少搞些，采取国际协作的方式解决。
    5.建设钢铁工厂花钱多，建设的时间长，又受到资源、交通和其他方面的限制。在通常的情况下，一个大型钢铁工厂，从开始建设到全部投入生产要七、八年的时间。因此，如果不及早做好准备，常常不容易赶上去。而机器制造工厂的建设比较快，一般地只要两三年就可以建成。
    但是，也不能由于强调发展钢铁工业，就把机器制造工业的投资削减得太多。因为：
    第一，我国机器制造工业的基础还薄弱，还有不少重要的缺门。例如：重型锻压设备，轧钢设备，氮肥设备，水泥设备，电气机车，内燃机车，远洋船舶，制造人造纤维和合成纤维的设备，精密的机床和量具，各种自动控制用的仪器和仪表等等。同时，我国目前的工厂，多数是制造单个的机器的，建设大型工厂所需的成套设备，主要还依靠进口。在第二个五年计划期内，我们必须争取自己供应成套设备。这样，需要制造的机器的品种和数量要增加很多，例如在一个发电站的设备中，除锅炉，透平，发电机几项主机以外，各种附属设备要占全部价值的一半以上，要有几十个工厂协作。因此，如果第二个五年计划期间机器制造工业的建设过少，到第三个五年计划时期就会发生新的不协调。
    第二，机器制造工业是国民经济技术改造的主导环节，如果过分地压缩对它的投资，就必然影响国民经济各部门今后的技术改造。同时，发展冶金、煤炭、化学、电力各项工业的任务本身就要求加快地发展机器制造工业。比如最近我们在研究要加快地发展化学肥料工业时，碰到的第一个问题就是设备供应的问题，设备供应的可能实际上已成为发展化学肥料的主要限度。因此，过分削弱机器制造工业是不妥当的。
    第三，机器制造工业是钢铁产品的主要用户，如果钢铁工业和机器制造工业的发展速度过分悬殊，将来也会发生钢铁材料过剩的情况。例如，目前我们一年造一万辆汽车，由于薄钢板不足，感觉困难很大。但是，一旦鞍钢的薄板厂投入生产，一年就能生产薄钢板三十万吨，那时候即使一年造三万辆汽车，也只要三万吨薄板。这就是说，到一定时期，钢铁工业就会反过来要求机器制造工业多用一些钢材。
    第四，由于我国农产品增产的速度不会很快，所以我国的外汇也将长期紧张。这就迫使我们必须尽可能地减少机器设备的进口，尽量提高机器设备自给率。目前在全部进口的价值中机器设备的进口额占40％左右，进口一台机器，动辄数万元，甚至数十万元，要用很多大豆、猪肉去换。因此，提高机器的自给率是一项极其严重的任务，对机器制造工业的建设仍然是不可忽视的。
