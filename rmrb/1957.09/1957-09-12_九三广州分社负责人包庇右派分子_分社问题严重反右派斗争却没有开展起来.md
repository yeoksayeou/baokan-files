Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 11th—The preparatory committee of the Jiu San Society's Guangzhou branch only held its first meeting for the anti-Rightist struggle on the 9th. This meeting was hastily convened after the Guangzhou Daily exposed the fact that the person in charge of the Jiu San Society's Guangzhou branch preparatory committee had been sitting still and doing nothing in the anti-Rightist struggle.

According to the Guangzhou Daily's exposure on the 8th, the problems of the Jiu San Society's Guangzhou branch are serious. After the establishment of the branch's preparatory committee in November last year, due to the implementation of a malignant "great development" policy, the number of branch members increased from four to one hundred and forty-two in just six months by May of this year. Many of them have unclear political backgrounds, complicated histories, and reactionary thoughts. According to materials already revealed by some grassroots organizations, rightists account for 20% of the members. Among the branch's ten grassroots organizations, two have completely become anti-Communist, anti-socialist small groups; some of the persons in charge or members of the other seven grassroots organizations are rightists. Some rightists have also been found in the leadership structure of the branch preparatory committee. Peng Guangqin, deputy director of the branch preparatory committee and deputy director of the South China Tropical Crops Research Institute, not only actively recruited soldiers and horses in the Tropical Crops Research Institute, attempting to usurp the scientific and technological leadership of the institute, but also personally planned and incited the masses to attack the Communist Party, turning the joint meeting of democratic party members of the institute into a meeting to attack and slander the Communist Party. After joining the Jiu San Society, Li Keji and Fu Shangzhi, engineers of the South China Aquatic Products Company, used deceptive and tempting means to win over a group of people who were dissatisfied with the Communist Party to join the Jiu San Society. They developed eleven members in two months, including embezzlers who had been sentenced to imprisonment, people who had participated in special agent organizations in the past, and landlords, bullies, and backbone members of reactionary parties and groups. During the period of great contending and blooming, Li Keji gathered these people together for secret meetings to attack the Communist Party, turning the entire organization into an anti-Communist and anti-socialist small group.

However, in the three months since Guangzhou City launched the anti-Rightist struggle, the preparatory committee of the Jiu San Society's Guangzhou branch has not held a single meeting to expose and criticize the rightists within the organization. Even when the anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and deeds of Peng Guangqin, deputy director of the branch preparatory committee, were exposed by the staff of the Tropical Crops Research Institute, the person in charge of the Jiu San Society's branch preparatory committee went to the Tropical Crops Research Institute to obstruct the process, demanding that the person in charge of the Chinese Communist Party committee in the institute be "cautious" about Peng Guangqin. Due to the sympathy and shielding of rightists by the main person in charge of the Jiu San Society's Guangzhou branch preparatory committee, the anti-Rightist struggle in the grassroots organizations of the Jiu San Society has not been actively carried out.

### 九三广州分社负责人包庇右派分子  分社问题严重反右派斗争却没有开展起来

　　九三广州分社负责人包庇右派分子
    分社问题严重反右派斗争却没有开展起来
    新华社广州11日电　九三学社广州分社筹备委员会，直到9日才第一次举行反右派斗争的会议。这次会议是在广州日报揭露了九三学社广州分社筹委会负责人在反右派斗争中按兵不动的事实以后才赶忙召开的。
    据8日的广州日报揭露，九三学社广州分社的问题是严重的。这个分社筹委会在去年11月成立后，由于执行了恶性“大发展”的方针，在到今年5月的短短半年内，分社成员就由四人发展到一百四十二人，其中有不少是政治面目不清、历史复杂、思想反动的人。据某些基层组织现已揭露的材料，成员中的右派分子就占20％。在分社十个基层组织中，有两个基层组织已完全变成反共反社会主义的小集团；还有七个基层组织的部分负责人或成员是右派分子。在分社筹委会的领导机构中也发现了一些右派分子。分社筹委会副主任委员、华南热带作物研究所副所长彭光钦，不仅在热带作物研究所积极招兵买马，企图篡夺研究所的科学技术领导权，还亲自策划、煽动群众向共产党进攻，把研究所民主党派成员的鸣放联席会议变成了攻击和污蔑共产党的会议。南海水产公司工程师李可基、傅尚芝加入九三学社后，用欺骗、利诱等手段拉拢了一批对共产党不满的人加入九三学社，他们在两个月中发展了十一个成员，其中有被判过徒刑的贪污分子，有历史上参加过特务组织的人和地主恶霸、反动党团骨干分子。李可基在大鸣大放期间把这些人召集起来开秘密会，向共产党进攻，把整个组织变成了反共反社会主义的小集团。
    可是广州市开展反右派斗争到现在三个月来，九三学社广州分社筹委会却未举行过一次揭露和批判组织内部右派分子的会议。甚至当分社筹委会副主任委员彭光钦的反共反社会主义言行被热带作物研究所工作人员揭露后，九三学社分社筹委会的负责人还到热带作物研究所进行阻挠，要求这个研究所中的中共党委会负责人对彭光钦要“慎重”。由于九三学社广州分社筹委会主要负责人同情、包庇右派分子，九三学社基层组织的反右派斗争也没有积极开展起来。
