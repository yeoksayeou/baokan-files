The recent National Congress of Arts and Crafts Artisans is unprecedented in the history of our country. Handicraft artisans with various specializations from all over the country gathered in Beijing to exchange experiences, learn from each other's strengths, and discuss certain issues. Vice Chairman Zhu De personally attended the conference and gave valuable instructions, and leading comrades from relevant central departments also attended and spoke. This is the greatest honor of my life. I am very moved. I ask: Without the leadership of the Communist Party, could such a united conference be held? Could such an honor be enjoyed?

During the group discussions at the conference, the fallacies of the right-wingers, who claimed that "in the past few years, arts and crafts have not only achieved nothing in socialist transformation, but have also been ruined," were refuted, and their sinister conspiracy to set fire among the artisans was exposed. After seeing the absurd remarks of the right-wingers, I was very angry and couldn't help but think of some of the tragic circumstances of my life in the old society.

Before liberation, people's lives were not guaranteed, and honest people with some achievements would be subject to unexpected disasters and displacement at any time. Artisans were looked down upon in the past. People often used the saying "the donkey entered the mill, the person entered the workshop" to describe the plight and social status of us folk artists (we were called "tricksters" in the past). Recalling the period when Japanese imperialism occupied our country, people were only allowed to eat mixed flour, not white flour. I had to put down my dough figurine making and pull rickshaws, or sell fried buns during the day and radishes and persimmons at night, to support my family of six. In this way, the capital gradually ran out, and my dough-kneading hands gradually became unresponsive. It makes my heart ache just thinking about it now. During the Kuomintang period, I wandered between the north and south, barely making a living in foreign towns with my skills. But often I didn't even have money for accommodation and transportation. In Shenyang, people knew there was a mute dough figurine maker, but actually, this person was not mute, but couldn't speak due to illness and anxiety. The mute person people were talking about was me. I couldn't finish talking about the suffering I had gone through in three days and three nights.

After liberation, it was like parting the dark clouds and seeing the sun. First, the leaders of the art circles came to my home to understand the situation, and then they encouraged me to participate in work and mobilized other artisans through me. Under the cultivation and education of the Party in the past few years, I feel that I have returned to my youthful vigor, and I have more energy to do anything. In 1956, I performed dough figurine making in London and was well received by people from other countries. I also traveled to many cities in various countries with the Chinese delegation. What is especially unforgettable is that I went to Moscow, the capital of the world's first socialist country, the Soviet Union. The Communist Party gave me all this! It was the Communist Party that gave my art a new life! Thinking about it, could a folk artist who was despised in the old society receive such attention? Could this have been possible in the past? In the past, I could only do some rough work like making fat babies and individual figures in ancient costumes. If I made a complete set, it would not sell well. But now I can make a complete set, and I can use whatever skills I have. In the past, we artisans struggled through wandering, hunger, and disease every day. Now, the government provides medical care when we are sick, and the government provides subsidies when we have difficulties. Some of my children have joined the workforce, and some are studying at school. The life I am living now is truly the life of peace and prosperity that people often talk about!

Looking back at the past and looking at the present, how can I not be moved to tears? Even a three-year-old child can tell the difference between good and bad, let alone a person like me who is nearly fifty years old? So I want to say: The Communist Party is my benefactor! It is the benefactor of us folk artists! It is the true savior of folk art in our country! After liberation, not only has the production of many valuable products been restored, but also more than 100 new products such as bamboo carvings, inlays, and hanging screens have been added. From 1950 to 1956, the export value of handicraft products reached more than 330 million yuan. With this money, nearly one million tons of steel rails can be exchanged, which can be used to lay two railways from Manzhouli to Guangzhou and one from Guangzhou to Shanghai. These achievements were obtained under the leadership of the Party and cannot be denied by the right-wingers!

In addition to working diligently and humbly and passing on my decades of experience to the next generation without reservation in order to inherit and develop China's artistic tradition, I also hope that the old artists across the country will work together to make folk arts and crafts bloom more brilliantly and splendidly to counter those shameless right-wingers who are telling lies with their eyes open. Absolutely do not allow the right-wingers to pull the wheel of socialism backward—to take the capitalist road and make us live a life worse than that of cattle and horses again. If anyone dares to say "no" to socialism, I will consider them my irreconcilable enemy and must fight them to the end!

    共产党是民间艺术的拯救者
    郎绍安
    最近召开的全国工艺美术艺人代表会议，是我国历史上从来没有过的。来自全国各地具有各种不同专长的手工艺艺人在北京欢聚一堂，交流经验取长补短，并对某些问题进行了讨论。朱德副主席还亲自出席了大会，并在会上做了宝贵的指示，中央各有关部门的领导同志也到会讲了话。这是我一生中最大的光荣。我非常感动。试问：如果没有共产党的领导能够召开这样团结的大会吗？能享受这样的荣誉吗？
    大会在进行小组讨论的时候，驳斥了右派分子说什么“几年来工艺美术在社会主义改造中不但毫无成绩，而且搞坏了”的一些谬论，揭露了他们在艺人中进行放火的阴险诡计。在我看到右派分子的荒谬言论以后，非常气愤，不禁想起了自己在旧社会的一些悲惨的生活境遇。
    解放前，人们的生活是得不到保障的，稍有一些作为的老实人，不知什么时候就会飞来横祸，流离失所。艺人在过去是被看不起的。人们常以“驴进了磨房，人进了作坊”的话来形容我们民间艺人（过去称我们是耍手艺的）的遭遇和社会地位。回想日本帝国主义在侵占我国的时期，只许人吃混合面，没有白面。我连捏面人的手艺也不得不放下，去拉洋车，或白天卖炸包子，晚上卖萝卜、卖柿子，来维持一家六口人的生活。这样，本钱慢慢地花光了，捏面人的手也渐渐不听使唤了。现在想起来真叫人心酸。国民党时期，我辗转颠波于南北各地，异乡城镇，仗着自己的手艺勉强糊口。但常常连住店和坐车的钱都没有。在沈阳，人们都知道有个哑吧捏面人的，其实这人并不哑，而是连病带急说不出话来的，人们说的那个哑吧就是指的我。想起过去所受过的苦那是三天三夜也说不完的。
    解放后，真是拨开了乌云见了太阳，首先是艺术界的领导人到我家来了解情况，接着就鼓励我参加工作，并通过我向其他的艺人进行动员。在党这几年的培养和教育下，我感到自己又回到年青力强的时候了，干什么劲头也大了。1956年我到伦敦进行捏面人的表演受到国外人士的好评。又随着中国代表团到过许多国家的城市，尤其使人难以忘怀的是我曾到过世界上第一个社会主义国家苏联的首都——莫斯科。这些都是共产党给我的！是共产党使我的艺术得到了新的生命！想想在旧社会一个为人所卑视的民间艺人能受到这样的重视么？这难道是过去所能有的事吗？过去，只能做像胖娃娃、单个古装人的一些粗活，要是捏成套的活反而不好卖。而现在也可以捏成套的东西，有什么本领也可以施展得开了。过去，我们艺人们天天在流浪、饥饿、疾病中挣扎度日，现在呢，有病政府给瞧，有困难政府给补助；我家里的孩子有的参加了工作，有的正在学校学习，我现在过的生活才真正是人常说的那安居乐业的日子！
    回想过去，看看现在，我怎能不感激得流泪呢？三岁的小孩都能认得出好坏来，何况我这个年近五十的人呢？所以我要说：共产党是我的恩人！是我们民间艺人的恩人！是我国真正的民间艺术的拯救者！解放后不仅恢复了许多名贵产品的生产，而且增加了如：竹刻、镶嵌、挂屏等一百多种新产品。从1950到1956年手工艺产品出口额达三亿三千多万元，用这些钱可换回近一百万吨钢轨，可以铺两条从满洲里到广州和一条由广州到上海的铁路。这些成绩都是在党的领导下获得的，也是不容右派分子抹煞的！
    我除虚心勤恳的工作并多带徒弟把自己几十年的经验毫无保留地交给下一代，使我国艺术传统得到继承和发展外，更希望全国的老艺人们共同努力，使民间工艺美术开放出更光辉更灿烂的花朵，来回击那些无耻的睁着眼睛说瞎话的右派分子。绝不允许右派分子把社会主义的车轮拉向倒退——走资本主义道路，使我们再过那牛马不如的生活。谁若是胆敢说社会主义一个“不”字，我就认为他们是我的势不两立的死敌，并且必须向他们斗争到底！
