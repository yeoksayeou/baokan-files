　　Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Ikeda Masanosuke, the head of the Japanese Trade Mission to China, made a statement at the airport upon his arrival in Beijing yesterday.

　　Ikeda Masanosuke said that the mission's visit to China this time is to negotiate with the Chinese side on the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. He said that the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, after being extended for one year, expired on May 3rd of this year. This situation is by no means satisfactory for the development and expansion of trade between China and Japan. We must try our best to overcome the various difficulties existing between the two countries and, on the basis of goodwill and deepened mutual understanding, solve various outstanding issues in a pragmatic manner. He finally expressed his hope that the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement could be signed as soon as possible.

　　池田正之辅到京时发表谈话
　　努力克服困难发展中日贸易
    新华社18日讯　日本访华通商使节团团长池田正之辅昨天到达北京时，在机场上发表了谈话。
    池田正之辅说，使节团这次来中国访问，是为了同中国有关方面谈判签订第四次日中贸易协定问题。他说，第三次日中贸易协定经过延长一年以后，已经在今年5月3日满期了。这种情形对于日中两国贸易的发展和扩大决不是令人满意的。我们要尽量克服两国之间所存在的种种困难，彼此在善意和加深相互了解的基础上，实事求是的解决各种悬而未决的问题。他最后表示希望能够早日签定第四次日中贸易协定。
