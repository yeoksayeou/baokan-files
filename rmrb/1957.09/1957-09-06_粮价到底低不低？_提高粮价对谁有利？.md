    Are Grain Prices Really Low? Who Benefits from Higher Grain Prices?
    In the Huoxing Agricultural Cooperative of Meishan Township, Anxi County, Fujian Province, a major debate on grain issues unfolded, criticizing the erroneous claims of a few wealthy farmers that grain was worthless.
    Who Says Grain Prices Are Low?
    Huoxing Cooperative is a surplus grain cooperative. Since the realization of cooperation in the autumn of 1955, grain production has increased year after year. However, a few individuals said that grain prices were too low. Some wealthy farmers openly claimed that grain was worthless and that farmers would never get rich by working to death and that engaging in sideline production was more worthwhile. They advocated raising grain prices and the free trade of grain. However, the majority of poor and lower-middle peasants in the cooperative opposed this argument and stood up to refute it during the debate. Su Zhu, a poor peasant member who had worked as a farmhand for landlords for five years, pointed at those who made fallacious remarks and said: Stop talking nonsense. I ask you, who benefited and who was harmed by the fluctuating grain prices in the past? Cai Weisheng, a poor peasant, said: Take the grain price, for example. In the past, unscrupulous merchants engaged in speculation and drove down prices as soon as the grain was harvested and raised prices when supplies were low. For example, in the year before the implementation of unified purchase and sale, one dan of rice was sold for four yuan and eighty cents, but when buying it back, it rose to nine yuan and seventy cents, a difference of more than double. As a result, the farmers suffered, and the unscrupulous merchants profited. He also cited that among the twenty-five households in Xinlu Corner of the cooperative, nineteen were poor and lower-middle peasants. In 1952, they sold 28,200 jin of grain and were exploited by unscrupulous merchants for 1,381 yuan by suppressing prices. When supplies were low, they bought back 11,400 jin from private merchants and were exploited for 558 yuan by raising grain prices. Chen Lun, a poor peasant, said tearfully: Before liberation, rice prices changed a thousand times a day. Unscrupulous merchants hoarded grain, and landlords and rich peasants took the opportunity to lend money at high interest rates. Poor peasants did not have money to buy such expensive rice, and they could not make ends meet. They were forced to sell their own children but still could not fill their stomachs. In Meibang Village alone, there were more than seventy households like me who sold their children to survive the famine. Isn't this because grain was in the hands of landlords, rich peasants, and unscrupulous merchants? Huang Sha Si, a member who rose from a poor peasant to a new middle peasant, said: In the past, only 53 households in the entire Meibang Village were able to hoard grain, accounting for less than 10%. More than 90% of the farmers were exploited. Now, with the policy of unified purchase and sale, grain and commodity prices are protected and remain stable for a long time. You still complain that grain is worthless? You really don't know how good you have it.
    Are Grain Prices Reasonable?
    During the debate, some people said that it was good that grain prices were stable, but the prices were relatively low. Zhan Qingquan, a poor peasant, said: The current grain price is higher than in the past for hardworking farmers; it is lower than in the past for those landlords, rich peasants, and well-to-do middle peasants. He used his own personal experience as an example. In 1952, the year before the unified purchase and sale, his family harvested 24 dan of rice. Because of repaying debts, buying fertilizer, and repairing agricultural tools, they sold a total of 11 dan, selling each dan for only four yuan and eighty cents. At the end of spring, when grain was in short supply, buying grain again cost nine yuan and seventy cents per dan. Now, rice costs seven yuan and twenty cents per dan, which is an increase of two yuan and forty cents for me; for rich peasants, well-to-do middle peasants, and speculative grain merchants, it is a loss of two yuan and fifty cents. This shows who is complaining that grain prices are low. Zhan Fangbi, a well-to-do middle peasant member, argued: Whether grain prices are low or not should be compared with industrial products. Compared in this way, grain is not worth the money. He also said that in the past, buying a set of twill clothes (twelve chi of cloth) only required thirty-eight jin of rice, but now... Before he could finish speaking, Xu Liang, a poor peasant member, stood up and said: At that time, black twill cost 3 jiao and 1 fen per chi, and now it costs 3 jiao and 2 fen per chi. Your rice is hoarded until the end of spring, and each hundred jin can be sold for nine yuan and seventy cents, which can buy thirty-one chi. We poor farmers cannot hoard it until spring, and each hundred jin is only sold for four yuan and eighty cents, which is not enough to exchange for sixteen chi of cloth. Now, all year round, the price of grain is seven yuan and twenty cents per hundred jin, which can be exchanged for twenty-two and a half chi of the same black twill. This refuted Zhan Fangbi so much that he had nothing to say. Wu Qi, a poor peasant member, said: In the past, my shorts were patched and patched again, and the sewing and patching weighed a total of one jin and six liang. Now, a family of seven not only has clothes for daily wear, but everyone also has a set of clothes to wear when visiting guests. If you say that it is not worthwhile to exchange grain for cloth, where did these new clothes come from?
    Who Benefits from Higher Grain Prices?
    As the debate progressed, Xu Fen, a member who rose from a poor peasant to a new upper-middle peasant, said: We farmers all participate in cooperatives, and we don't have to worry about food. Last year, we sold more than 450,000 jin of surplus grain. If grain prices were raised a little, wouldn't everyone's income increase even more? As soon as this question was raised, another debate unfolded immediately. Everyone used their personal experiences over the past few years to focus on criticizing this capitalist idea of only wanting to make money. Members said in the debate that farmers only produce one item, grain, and everything else depends on the supply of others. If farmers raise the price of grain, the price of industrial products will also have to rise. How could that be allowed? Xu Po, a poor peasant, said: In 1952, before the unified purchase and sale of grain, each hundred jin of fertilizer cost twenty-seven yuan, but now it costs eighteen yuan and seventy cents. Last year, the cooperative bought 60,000 jin of fertilizer, which was 4,980 yuan cheaper than in 1952. This is grain supporting industrial development, and industry supporting agricultural production to increase production. Otherwise, don't think about increasing grain production and having enough food and clothing. Members of the 11th Production Team calculated an account for the entire cooperative, saying that after the autumn of 1955, the state helped us build the large-scale Baise Irrigation Canal, which guaranteed that thousands of mu of farmland would be free from the threat of drought, and many drylands were transformed into paddy fields. The area of early rice in the cooperative increased from 1,400 mu in 1955 to 1,750 mu. The average yield per mu increased from 291 jin to 336 jin. This is the most fundamental and long-term interest of farmers.
      The More We Debate, the Clearer It Becomes
    After organizing a major debate on grain prices with 1,040 people, the Huoxing Cooperative became clearer about whether grain prices were low or not. Many people raised their awareness, automatically criticized muddled thinking, and abandoned the plan to only care about themselves and not the country. Li Zhi, a new lower-middle peasant, said: A few days ago, I also echoed the call that grain prices were low and not worthwhile. Now, after criticizing capitalist ideas, I realize that only caring about the moment will mislead a lifetime. At present, in addition to completing the task of unified purchase of 250,000 jin in the early season, the cooperative has sold more than 21,000 jin of surplus grain, which is more than 91,000 jin more than in the early season last year.

### 粮价到底低不低？  提高粮价对谁有利？

    粮价到底低不低？  提高粮价对谁有利？
    福建省安溪县美山乡火星农业社在粮食问题大辩论中，就粮价低不低问题展开辩论，批判了少数富裕农民叫喊粮食不值钱的谬论。
    什么人叫粮价低？
    火星社是个余粮社，从1955年秋后实现合作化以来，连年粮食增产。但有个别人却说粮价太低，有些富裕农民公开叫喊现在粮食不值钱，农民干到死都不会富裕，不如搞副业生产合算，他们主张提高粮价和自由买卖粮食。但是社内大多数贫农和下中农反对这个论调，在辩论会上纷纷起来反驳。曾经替地主当过五年长工的贫农社员苏贮指着发谬论的人说：别说那没有良心话，请问过去粮价忽高忽低，对谁有利对谁不利呢？贫农蔡维生说：就说粮价吧，过去奸商投机倒把，五谷登场就杀价，青黄不接就抬价，例如实行统购统销前一年，一担谷子卖出四元八角，买入时涨到九元七角，相差一倍多。结果是农民吃亏，奸商得利。他还举出该社新路角落二十五户中，有十九户贫农和下中农，在1952年卖出粮食二万八千二百斤，被奸商压价剥削了一千三百八十一元，到青黄不接再向私商买入一万一千四百斤，就被抬高粮价剥削了五百五十八元。贫农陈论激动得下泪说：解放前米价一日千变，奸商把粮食囤积起来，地主、富农乘机放高利贷。贫苦农民没有钱买那样的贵米，上顿接不着下顿，被迫卖掉亲生儿子还填不饱肚子。像我这样卖子度荒的人，仅美榜村就有七十多户，这还不是粮食掌握在地主富农和奸商手里的缘故？由贫农上升为新中农的社员黄沙四说：过去全美榜村能够囤积粮食只有五十三户，占不上10％。90％以上的农民受到剥削，现在有了统购统销政策，保护粮价物价长期稳定，还嫌粮食不值钱？真是身在福中不知福。
    粮价合不合理？
    辩论会上有的人说，粮价稳定好是好，就是价格较低。贫农占清泉说：现在的粮价对勤劳农民来说，是比过去高；对那些地主、富农和富裕中农来说，是比过去低的。他以自己亲身经历事实说，1952年统购统销前一年，他家收成二十四担谷子，因还债、买肥田粉和修补农具，共计卖了十一担谷，每担只卖四元八角，春尾缺粮再买粮时，每担涨到九元七角。现在稻谷每担七元二角，对我来说是增加二元四角；对富农和富裕中农及投机粮商来说，是少卖了二元五角。这就可以看出什么人才叫粮价低了？富裕中农社员占方碧辩解说：粮价低不低要拿它和工业品来对比，这样比粮食却就不值钱了。他又说，以前买一套斜文布的衣服（十二尺布），只需三十八斤稻谷，现在却……。他的话音未落，贫农社员许两站起来说：当时乌斜文每尺三角一分钱，现在一尺三角二分钱。你的稻谷囤至春尾，每百斤卖九元七角，可买三十一尺。我们穷苦农民，没法囤积春头，每百斤只卖四元八角，还换不上十六尺布。现在一年四季谷价每百斤七元二角，可换回同样乌斜文布二十二尺半。这一下把占方碧驳得无话可说了。贫农社员吴气说：过去我一条短裤破了补，补了破，先后缝补共一斤六两重。现在一家七口，不但有粗穿的。而且每人都有一套作客衣服，要说粮食换布不合算，这些新衣服从那里来的？
    提高粮价对谁有利？
    辩论在进行中，有个从贫农上升为新上中农社员许分说：咱农民都参加合作社，口粮不愁了，去年一年余粮就卖四十五万多斤。如果粮价提高一些，大家不是增加收入更多吗？这个问题一提出来，立即又展开了辩论。大家都以几年来的亲身感受，集中批判了这种光想赚钱的资本主义思想。社员们在辩论中说，农民只有生产一项粮食，其他都是伸手靠别人供应，农民种植粮食提高价格，工业品同样也要提高，这还了得吗？贫农许婆说：1952年粮食未统购统销，每百斤肥田粉二十七元，现在十八元七角，全社去年购买肥田粉六万斤，就比1952年便宜了四千九百八十元。这就是粮食支援工业发展，工业支持农业增加生产，否则别想增收粮食，丰衣足食。第十一生产队社员为全社算笔账说，1955年秋后，国家帮助我们修建大型白濑水圳，保证了千亩农田免受干旱威胁，使很多旱地变水田。全社早稻面积从1955年的一千四百亩增加至一千七百五十亩。每亩平均产量由二百九十一斤提高到三百三十六斤，这才是农民最根本最长远的利益。
      越辩越明
    火星社经过组织一千零四十人的粮食价格大辩论，对粮价低不低问题愈辩愈明。很多人提高了认识，自动批判了糊涂思想，放弃了只顾自己不顾国家的打算。新下中农李枝说：前些日子，我也随声附和喊叫粮价低，不合算，现在批判了资本主义思想，才认识只顾一时，就会误一世。目前全社除按早季统购任务二十五万斤完成外，又卖了二万一千多斤余粮，比去年早季多卖了九万一千多斤粮食。
