    A Stroll Through Ba Dinh Square
    By Our Correspondent Zhan Chao
    We arrived at Ba Dinh Square with reverence.

    This large, circular square, which can accommodate 120,000 people at once, is backed by the Presidential Palace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It is surrounded by evergreen trees and grass plots, and radiating tree-lined avenues connect it perfectly to the rest of Hanoi.

    Twelve years ago, on September 2, 1945, President Ho Chi Minh, the beloved leader of the Vietnamese people, read the famous "Declaration of Independence" on this very square.

    "We, the Provisional Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, solemnly declare to the world that Vietnam has the right to enjoy freedom and independence, and has in fact become a free and independent country. The entire people of Vietnam are determined to mobilize all their spiritual and material strength, and will not hesitate to sacrifice their lives and property to defend its independence and freedom."

    This voice, full of national pride and unwavering determination, crossed Ba Dinh Square, crossed the capital Hanoi, crossed the borders of Vietnam, and spread throughout the world.

    It has been twelve years since then. And those who have experienced the "August Revolution" still retain the most precious memories.
  Comrade Tran Quang Huy, Deputy Director of the Central Propaganda Department of the Vietnamese Labor Party and Editor-in-Chief of "Learning Magazine," who was strolling with us, suddenly stopped in the middle of Ba Dinh Square. He gestured, saying that at that time, a temporary platform of four meters square was erected here. President Ho Chi Minh and the ministers of the Provisional Government stood on the platform to meet the more than 500,000 people from the capital and from various provinces who were ecstatic and crowded in the square and on the tree-lined avenues. This robust man, who was once the Secretary of the Hanoi Municipal Committee of the Indochinese Communist Party and Chairman of the Provisional Municipal Government during the General Uprising and is not yet thirty-seven years old, vividly recalled that when President Ho began to read the "Declaration of Independence," he kindly asked: "Comrades! Can you hear clearly?" The Vietnamese people, who had been humiliated for nearly a century under the trampling of colonialism, suddenly heard such infinitely warm words that many were moved to tears. Comrade Tran Quang Huy said: "That scene is unforgettable for a lifetime!"

    In the days that followed, we strolled in Ba Dinh Square many times, or passed through the square to visit the participants of the "August Revolution" in nearby places.

    I am very fortunate to have met people from all walks of life during that historical period in a very short time. Among them were the Vice-Chairman of the Provisional Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and historian Tran Huy Lieu, who was elected by the Tan Trao Conference at that time; the sixty-seven-year-old revolutionary veteran and Chairman of the Hanoi Fatherland Front, Ton That Thien; Hoang Van Thai, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Vietnamese People's Army, one of the founders of the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces and war zones (revolutionary base areas); Ha Que, Vice-Chairman of the Vietnam Women's Union, who once led guerrillas to capture the enemy's county government and expand the central war zone; Tran Huu Duc, Chairman of the People's Committee of Central Vietnam at that time and Director of the Office of Agriculture and Forestry of the Prime Minister's Office; Duong Bach Mai, member of the People's Committee of Southern Vietnam in the past and Vice-Chairman of the Vietnam-Soviet Friendship Association; Tran Quyet and Ha Minh Tuan, the leaders of the famous Workers' Assault Team and Youth Assault Team, the female teacher Nguyen Thi Dieu Hong, and the young poet Nguyen Dinh Thi, who participated in the general uprising in the capital; and Du Thi Luan, the earliest female soldier in the Vietnamese People's Army, who, together with another female guerrilla fighter, raised the first gold-starred red flag over Ba Dinh Square when the independence ceremony was held twelve years ago.

    When people recall that very important period of their lives, they cannot help but be slightly excited. The true stories told from passionate mouths are so simple and moving. They intertwine to form a picture that presents the entire historical period of the "August Revolution" before your eyes.

    Before the "August Revolution" was the most turbulent and darkest period in Vietnamese society. Eighty years of cruel exploitation by French colonialists had already plunged Vietnam into extreme poverty. In 1940, Japanese fascism was added, and their insatiable plunder pushed Vietnam to the brink. At that time, under the leadership of the Indochinese Communist Party, the predecessor of the Vietnamese Labor Party, people everywhere rose up to defend themselves. At the end of that year, the famous "Bac Son Uprising," "Do Luong Uprising," and "Nam Ky Uprising" broke out one after another in the north, central, and south. Although the flames of the uprising were soon extinguished under the frenzied destruction of the colonialists, the heroes of the "Bac Son Uprising" raised the first gold-starred red flag. In July 1941, on the top of a mountain called Vu Lang in the dense forests of Viet Bac, an oath was taken to establish a people's armed force - the "Vietnam National Salvation Army." They had only one platoon at the time, but it quickly grew several times over. On December 22, 1944, another people's armed force - the "Vietnam People's Liberation Army Propaganda Team" - was declared established on a high mountain in Cao Bang. On the same night, it wiped out two enemy strongholds in a row, growing from a company to a battalion. On April 9, 1945, the two armed forces met in Thai Nguyen Province and were unified into the "Vietnam Liberation Army." At this time, the liberated areas continued to expand, including seven provinces in Viet Bac: Cao Bang, Bac Kan, Lang Son, Thai Nguyen, etc., becoming the revolutionary base area of the country.

    On May 9, 1945, the French colonialists surrendered to the Japanese fascists after a night of weak resistance. Around this time, in order to consolidate the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and to accumulate strategic materials for prolonged resistance, the Japanese fascists massively exploited rice in Vietnam on the one hand, and forced farmers to uproot seedlings and plant jute on the other, resulting in an unprecedented famine. In those days that were unbearable to recall, people in the Red River Delta provinces of Thai Binh, Nam Dinh, and Hung Yen, known as the "granary," starved to death in batches. Those who did not die dragged their withered bodies to the cities, only to fall along the way. Those who were fortunate enough to reach the cities also withered away because they had no rice to eat. Some people were even thrown onto garbage trucks before they had died and transported in piles to the suburbs for burial. During those three or four consecutive months of famine, more than two million people starved to death in the area north of Quang Tri Province in Vietnam! Except for a few inhumane Vietnamese traitors like Tran Trong Kim, all Vietnamese people were angered. People urgently demanded an early end to the rule of the invaders and to take their destiny into their own hands. At this moment, the news of the Soviet Red Army's successive victories on the European battlefield greatly encouraged the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese "Independence League," led by the Indochinese Communist Party, was developing rapidly throughout the country, and almost all men, women, old, and young became members of the "Viet Minh" or its supporters. In the countryside, people rose up like a storm, took up hoes and carrying poles, and split open the enemy's granaries. In the cities, there were activities of Workers' Assault Teams and Youth Assault Teams everywhere. They even executed heinous Vietnamese traitors on the main streets and put the gold-starred red flag, symbolizing independence and freedom, on the Turtle Tower in Hoan Kiem Lake in Hanoi. The mighty revolutionary spirit was overflowing throughout the country.

    The most unforgettable was August 1945. On August 15, Japanese fascism, under the irresistible offensive of the Soviet Red Army, announced its unconditional surrender. On August 16, the Vietnam Liberation Army received the Indochinese Communist Party and the "Viet Minh's" First Order to advance into the northern plains. At the same time, the National Congress held in Tan Trao, Tuyen Quang Province, quickly made a decision on a nationwide general uprising, and the representatives set off day and night. The situation was changing rapidly, and there could be no hesitation. When many representatives of the Tan Trao Conference had not yet arrived, the local party committees had already started to act based on the Party Central Committee's resolution in March. On August 19, Hanoi took the lead in launching an uprising. Excited crowds waved red flags and surged forward like a tide, occupying the "Northern Palace" and confiscating the weapons of the "Security Army." When the Workers' Assault Team and the Youth Assault Team moved into the barracks of the "Security Army," an officer of the Japanese fascist invasion army drove up in an armored vehicle, but under the threat of the angry masses, it had no choice but to retreat. Hanoi thus returned to the people without firing a shot. Following this, on August 23, the central region launched an uprising, on August 25, the southern region launched an uprising, and on August 29, the puppet emperor Bao Dai abdicated. On September 2, assemblies were held throughout the country to celebrate independence. On Ba Dinh Square in Hanoi, after President Ho Chi Minh read the "Declaration of Independence," the Vice-Chairman of the Provisional Government, Tran Huy Lieu, presented the gold seal and sword that Bao Dai had handed over when he abdicated, and the whole audience cheered. From then on, an old system—the corrupt feudal and colonial system—was overthrown. A new system—the people's democratic system created by the "August Revolution" with unlimited vitality—was born.

    Today, we have come to Ba Dinh Square again. Ba Dinh (meaning three communal houses) was originally the name of a place in Thanh Hoa Province. There, the first anti-French movement broke out. To commemorate the heroic and unyielding struggle of the Vietnamese people for nearly a century, after the victory of the "August Revolution," people renamed this square "Ba Dinh" Square. Over the past twelve years, this square has recorded the entire process of the Vietnamese people's struggle to win the "August Revolution" and heroically defend the fruits of victory. On October 10, 1954, after eight or nine years of long-term resistance, the heroic Vietnamese People's Army re-entered the capital Hanoi. When the re-capitalization ceremony was held on January 1, 1955, President Ho Chi Minh, the beloved leader of the Vietnamese people, the Vietnamese Labor Party, and the Democratic Republic, appeared again on the platform of Ba Dinh Square, and the gold-starred red flag, which had been defended at the cost of so many martyrs' blood, was raised again over the square. People were deeply moved by this scene.

    Now it is approaching the eve of the National Day again. The Vietnamese people will pass through the square with the achievements of three years of restoration and construction, and with magnificent steps. The firm will of the people to follow the path opened up by the "August Revolution" towards peaceful unification and prosperity and happiness cannot be stopped by any force. (Attached picture)

    巴亭广场漫步
    本报记者  展潮
    我们怀着崇敬的心情来到了巴亭广场。
    这个可以同时容纳十二万人的、环形的大广场，背倚着越南民主共和国主席府，周围萦绕着四季常青的树木和草坛，几条辐射的林荫大道使它和河内市区其他部分联结成一个完美的整体。
    十二年前，1945年9月2日，越南人民敬爱的领袖胡志明主席，就是在这个广场上宣读那篇著名的“独立宣言”的。
    “我们——越南民主共和国临时政府——郑重的向全世界宣布：越南具有享受自由和独立的权利，并实际上已经成为一个自由和独立的国家。越南全体人民决心动员一切精神和物质力量，并且不惜牺牲他们的生命和财产来保卫它的独立和自由。”
    这个充满着民族自豪精神的、坚定不移的声音，越过了巴亭广场，越过了首都河内，越过了越南国境，传遍了全世界。
    从那时候到现在已经整整十二年了。而经受过“八月革命”洗礼的那一代人还依然保存着最珍贵的记忆。
  和我们一起漫步的越南劳动党中央宣传部副部长、“学习杂志”总编辑陈光辉同志，突然在巴亭广场正中停了下来。他以手势比划着说，当时这里临时架设着一个四公尺见方的主席台，胡志明主席和临时政府的部长们站在台上，同欣喜若狂、拥塞在广场和林荫大道上的五十多万首都以及从各省赶来的群众见面。这位曾经是总起义时期印度支那共产党河内市委书记兼临时市政府主席、不满三十七岁的壮年人记忆犹新地说，胡主席刚开始宣读“独立宣言”，便亲切地问道：“同胞们！听清楚吗？”在殖民主义者蹂躏下屈辱了将近一个世纪的越南人民，猛然听到了这样一句无限温暖的话，许多人都感动得流泪了。陈光辉同志说：“那种情景，使人终生难忘！”
    在以后一些日子里，我们又曾经好多次地在巴亭广场上漫步，或者通过广场到附近的地方去，访问当年“八月革命”的参加者们。
    我非常庆幸，能够在很短的时间里，见到了那个历史时期各个方面的人物。在他们里面，有当时新潮会议推选的越南民主共和国临时政府副主席、历史学家陈辉燎；有六十七岁的革命老人、河内祖国战线主席尹计善；有越南人民武装和战区（革命根据地）创立者之一的越南人民军副总参谋长黄文泰；有曾经带领游击队攻克敌人县政府、扩大中央战区的、越南妇女联合会副主席何桂；有当时越南中部人民委员会主席、总理府农林办公厅主任陈有翼；有过去南部人民委员会委员、越苏友好协会副会长杨白梅；有参加首都总起义的、著名的工人冲锋队和青年冲锋队领导人陈决、何明遵，女教员阮氏耀红和青年诗人阮廷诗；还有越南人民军里最早的一位女战士杜氏鸾，十二年前举行独立典礼的时候，正是她和另外一位女游击队员，把第一面金星红旗升在巴亭广场的上空。
    当人们回想起自己生命中非常重要的那段岁月，总不免微微有点激动、兴奋；那些从热情的口里讲出来的真实的故事，是多么朴素而动听，它们互相交织成一幅图画，使“八月革命”那段历史时期整个都呈现在你的面前了。
    “八月革命”以前是越南社会最动荡、最黑暗的时期，法国殖民者八十年残酷的压榨已经使越南陷于极端穷困的境地；1940年又增加一个日本法西斯，它们贪得无餍地掠夺，更把越南推向绝路。当时在越南劳动党的前身印度支那共产党的领导下，各地人民纷纷起来进行自卫。在这一年年底，在北部、中部和南部接连爆发了有名的“北山起义”、“都良起义”和“南圻起义”，起义的火焰虽然在殖民者疯狂的摧残下不久就熄灭了，但是“北山起义”的英雄们却高举起了第一面金星红旗。1941年7月在越北丛山密林里的一座叫武郎山的山头上，宣誓成立一支人民武装——“越南救国军”，他们当时总共只有一排人，但是很快就发展了好几倍。1944年12月22日，另外一支人民武装——“越南人民解放军宣传队”在高平一座高山上宣告成立，当天夜里就连续消灭了敌人的两个据点，从一个中队发展成一个大队。1945年4月9日，这两支武装在太原省会师了，统一编成“越南解放军”。这时，解放区不断扩大，包括越北高平、北?、谅山、太原等七省，成为全国革命的根据地。
    1945年5月9日，法国殖民者经过一夜微弱的抵抗后投降了日本法西斯。在这前后，日本法西斯为了巩固“东亚共荣圈”，为了积蓄战略物资以长期顽抗，就在越南一面大量搜括大米，一面强迫农民铲除秧苗，种植黄麻，结果造成了一次空前未有的大饥荒。在那令人不忍回顾的日子里，被称为“谷仓”的红河三角洲太平、南定、兴安等省，人们成批成批地饿死；没有死的拖着干枯的躯体走向城市，结果走一路倒一路；那些侥幸的挨到城市里的人，也因为没有米吃而枯萎掉，甚至有些人还没有咽气就被抛到垃圾车上，成堆成堆地运到郊外去埋葬。在那时连续三、四个月的灾荒里，越南自广治省以北的地区饿死了二百多万人！除了少数像陈重金之流没有人性的越奸外，所有的越南人都被激怒起来了。人们迫切地要求早日结束侵略者的统治，把命运掌握在自己手里。正在此时，苏联红军在欧洲战场上节节胜利的消息，大大地鼓舞了越南人民。印度支那共产党所领导的越南“独立同盟”，在全国各地迅速地发展着，几乎所有的男女老少都成了“越盟”或者是它的拥护者。在农村里，风起云涌的人们拿起锄头和扁担，劈开了敌人的谷仓；在城市里，到处都有工人冲锋队和青年冲锋队的活动，他们甚至就在大街通衢上处决罪大恶极的越奸，把那面象征独立自由的金星红旗，插在河内还剑湖中的龟塔上……。那种浩浩荡荡的革命气势，洋溢全国。
    最令人难忘的是1945年的8月了。8月15日，日本法西斯在苏联红军锐不可当的攻势下，宣布无条件投降。8月16日，越南解放军接受印度支那共产党和“越盟”第一号进军令，向北部平原挺进。同时，在宣光省新潮地方举行的国民大会迅速作出全国总起义的决定，代表们便星夜启程。当时形势急转直下，不能有任何迟疑。当新潮会议的许多代表还未赶到时，各地党委就已根据党中央3月的决议开始了行动。8月19日，河内首先举行起义，激动的人群挥舞着红旗，潮水似地向前拥去，占领了“北部府”，收缴了“保安兵”的武器。当工人冲锋队和青年冲锋队进驻“保安兵”的兵营时，日本法西斯侵略军的一个军官把铁甲车开来了，可是在愤怒的群众的威迫之下，它又无可奈何地退走了。河内就这样一枪不响地回到人民手里。紧接着，8月23日，中部举行起义，8月25日，南部举行起义；8月29日，傀儡皇帝保大退位。9月2日这一天，全国各地都集会庆祝独立，在河内巴亭广场上，胡志明主席宣读了“独立宣言”以后，临时政府副主席陈辉燎把保大退位时交出的金印和宝剑呈献在大家面前的时候，全场欢呼不绝。从此，一个旧的制度——腐朽的封建、殖民主义制度被推翻了。一个新的制度——具有无限生命力的、由“八月革命”创建的人民民主制度诞生了。
    今天，我们又来到巴亭广场。巴亭（即三亭）原是清化省的一个地名。在那里，曾经爆发了最初的抗法运动。为了纪念近一个世纪以来越南人民英勇不屈的斗争，在“八月革命”胜利之后，人们便把这个广场改称为“巴亭”广场。在过去的十二年间，这个广场曾经记载着越南人民争取“八月革命”胜利以及为保卫胜利果实而英勇斗争的全部进程。1954年10月10日，经过八、九年长期抗战之后，英雄的越南人民军又重新开进首都河内；当1955年1月1日举行还都典礼时，越南人民敬爱的胡志明主席、越南劳动党和民主共和国的领导人又在巴亭广场的主席台上出现，那面不知流尽多少烈士鲜血才保卫住的金星红旗，又在广场的上空升起来了。人们都被这种情景深深地感动着。
    现在又临近国庆的前夕了。越南人民将要带着三年恢复建设的成绩、迈着雄壮的脚步通过广场。人们沿着“八月革命”开辟的道路走向和平统一和繁荣幸福的坚决意志，是任何力量都阻挡不了的。（附图片）
