    Empty Talk Cannot Deceive People
    By a Commentator of This Newspaper
    The meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee in London has adjourned. This meeting dragged on for nearly six months, but achieved nothing.
    What caused this negotiation to fail again? It is because Western countries, especially the United States and Britain, continue to adopt an attitude of evading any agreement. Throughout the negotiation process, Western countries, led by the United States, have constantly created obstacles and refused to address practical issues. In the final stages of the negotiations, Western countries, under the direction of the United States, focused their efforts on creating a deception to shirk responsibility and deceive world opinion. This is the "package proposal" called a "working paper" presented by Western countries at the London meeting on August 29, after repeated secret consultations between the United States and other countries of the North Atlantic group.
    The content of this "document" is extremely complex, filled with beautiful words about disarmament, but contains no constructive new content. It is merely a patchwork of various bits and pieces that Western countries have piecemeal peddled on the negotiating table over the past five months. On some important issues, this "working paper" retreated even further than the positions taken by Western countries in the early stages of the negotiations. For example, regarding the cessation of nuclear weapons testing and the reduction of conventional armaments, this "document" includes not only the various conditions put forward by Western countries during the negotiations, but also some new conditions and reservations. These conditions and reservations make any problem that could be expected to be solved complex and difficult to reach an agreement on. In particular, Western countries also put forward a general condition: the "clauses of this working paper are not divisible." This means that some urgent and important issues in the disarmament negotiations that need to be resolved and are likely to be resolved, such as the immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing, must be entangled with a whole bunch of irrelevant issues, such as the so-called "open skies," "outer space for peaceful purposes," "cessation of production of military fissile materials," and so on, which are artificially created by Western countries. As long as any one of these items is not resolved, all other issues cannot be resolved separately. In this way, a total dead knot is actually tied to the resolution of all disarmament issues.
    Western countries apparently believe that by using this "package" of beautiful proposals that cannot be agreed upon at all, they can ensure that they avoid reaching an agreement on certain issues that can be resolved separately, and at the same time, they can shift the responsibility for failing to reach an agreement to the Soviet Union. In fact, before and after Western countries put forward this "working paper," their propaganda tune followed this rhythm, culminating in the speeches of U.S. President Eisenhower. Commenting on the Western proposal of the "working paper" on September 3, Eisenhower said: "Western countries cannot take any constructive new steps on the current disarmament issue; the next action must come from the Soviet Union."
    According to the wishful thinking of Western countries, in this way, the ball is kicked back to the Soviet Union, and in the face of the world's growing wave of demands for disarmament and the immediate cessation of nuclear testing, they can sit down and take a breather. However, the eyes of the vast majority of people in the world are becoming increasingly bright. They see very clearly that there are two different attitudes towards negotiations in the negotiation process.
    The Soviet Union has consistently strived for an agreement. In the final stages of the negotiations, it also made significant efforts to ensure that the negotiations could achieve even preliminary results. Soviet representative Zorin once again made a proposal urging Western countries to take practical actions and immediately reach an agreement on the urgent and primary disarmament measures, especially the cessation of nuclear testing. But while the Soviet Union was making efforts to save the London negotiations, Western countries were busy with the so-called "propaganda war," looking for excuses to obstruct the agreement and shirk responsibility. Associated Press reporter Hightower once bluntly stated that Western countries are "worrying about two issues." One is "how to do it in terms of propaganda." Western countries need to find a "dramatic way" to appease world opinion; the other is that "the Soviet Union may force the reorganization of the entire negotiation system at the next session of the United Nations General Assembly." Western countries are very afraid of inviting other relevant countries such as India to participate in the discussion of disarmament issues, as advocated by the Soviet Union, and of making the negotiations public. From this, it can be seen that the final proposal of the so-called "working paper" by Western countries was not to solve any partial disarmament issues, but to deal with the two issues that Hightower said were worrying the Western governments. They believe that with this "working paper" in hand, on the one hand, they can say that Western countries have made every possible effort and that the responsibility for the failure of the London negotiations lies entirely with the Soviet Union; on the other hand, they can say that due to this effort by the West, the disarmament issue already has a basis for negotiation, and there is no need for the United Nations General Assembly to intervene. Thus, everything is fine, and their trick of obstructing disarmament and opposing the cessation of nuclear testing can continue.
    However, the responsibility for the fact that the disarmament negotiations have not yielded any results so far lies entirely with the West, and this cannot be shirked with empty talk. Western countries will soon find that this "working paper" of theirs, full of empty talk, like the various other proposals they have put forward in the negotiation process, cannot stop the giant wave of people around the world demanding disarmament and the cessation of nuclear testing.

    花言巧语骗不了人

    联合国裁军小组委员会在伦敦举行的会议已经休会了。这个会议先后拖了将近六个月，但是一无结果。
    是什么原因使得这次谈判又告失败呢？这是因为西方国家、特别是美国和英国继续采取逃避达成任何协议的态度。在谈判的过程中，以美国为首的西方国家，一直横生枝节，拒绝解决实际问题。在谈判的最后阶段，西方国家在美国的导演下，更集中精力制造了一个推卸责任、欺蒙世界舆论的骗局。这就是经过美国和北大西洋集团其他国家间的反复密谋之后，西方国家于8月29日在伦敦会议上提出的一个被称为“工作文件”的“一揽子建议”。
    这个“文件”的内容十分庞杂，塞满了关于裁军的漂亮字眼，但是没有半点建设性的新内容，而不过是把过去五个多月中西方国家先后在谈判桌上零敲碎打地贩卖过的各种破铜烂铁拼凑到一起。在一些重要问题上，这个“工作文件”比西方国家在谈判前期采取过的立场更加后退了。例如，在有关停止核武器试验和裁减常规军备方面，这个“文件”中除了包括西方国家在谈判中陆续提出的各种条件之外，又增添了一些新的条件和保留。这些条件和保留，使得任何一个可以期望解决的问题都变得复杂而难以达成协议。特别是西方国家还提出了这样一个总的条件：这个工作文件的“条款不得分割”。这就是说，裁军谈判中一些迫切需要解决并有可能解决的紧要问题，如立即停止核武器试验的问题，必须要同其他的一大堆不相干的问题，如西方国家人为地制造出来的所谓“开放天空”、“外空用于和平目的”、“停止生产军用裂变物质”等等纠缠在一起。只要其中任何一项未获解决，所有其他问题也都不能单独解决。这样，实际上就为一切有关裁军问题的解决打上了一个总的死结。
    西方国家显然以为用这种根本无法达成协议的“一揽子”的漂亮的建议，既可以保险避免在某些本可以单独解决的问题上达成协议，又可以把达不成协议的责任推在苏联身上。事实上，在西方国家提出这个“工作文件”的前后，它们的宣传调子就是按照这一个节拍的，而以美国总统艾森豪威尔的谈话集其大成。艾森豪威尔9月3日在评论西方提出“工作文件”一事时说：“西方国家不能在目前裁军问题上采取任何建设性的新步骤，下一行动必须来自苏联。”
    按照西方国家的如意想法，这样一来，球又踢回给苏联了，在全世界日益高涨的要求裁军和立即停止核试验的浪潮面前，可以坐下来喘息一下了。但是，世界广大人民的眼睛，愈来愈亮。他们看得很清楚：在谈判过程中存在着两种不同的对待谈判的态度。
    苏联一贯努力地谋求协议，在谈判的最后阶段，它还作了重大的努力，争取使谈判能够得到即使是初步的结果。苏联代表佐林曾再一次提出建议，敦促西方国家采取实际行动，先就刻不容缓的首要裁军措施、特别是停止核试验的问题，立刻达成协议。但是在苏联作挽救伦敦谈判的努力时，西方国家却在忙于所谓“宣传战”，寻找阻挠协议而又推卸责任的借口。美联社记者海托华曾经露骨地说过：西方国家正在“为两个问题发愁”。一个是“在宣传方面怎样做法”，西方国家需要找出一种“戏剧化的办法”来搪塞世界舆论；另一个是“苏联可能在联合国大会下届会议上迫使改组整个谈判体系”。西方国家非常害怕像苏联主张的那样，邀请其他有关国家诸如印度来参加裁军问题的讨论，并让谈判公开进行。由此可见，西方国家最后提出所谓“工作文件”，并不是为了解决什么局部裁军问题，而是为了应付海托华所说的这两个使西方国家政府发愁的问题的。他们以为，拿着这个“工作文件”，一方面可以说，西方国家已经作了尽可能的努力，伦敦谈判失败的责任全在苏联；另一方面可以说，裁军问题由于西方的这个努力已经有了可以谈判的基础，无需联合国大会来插手。于是万事大吉，它们阻挠裁军和反对停止核试验的把戏就可以继续耍下去了。
    但是，裁军谈判迄今未得任何结果的责任全在西方，这决不是花言巧语所能推诿得了的。西方国家很快就会发现，它们的这个一派花言巧语的“工作文件”，像它们在谈判过程中提出过的形形色色的其他方案一样，挡不住全世界人民要求裁军和停止核试验的巨浪。
