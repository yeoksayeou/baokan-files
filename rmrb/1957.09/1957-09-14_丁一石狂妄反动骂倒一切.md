Ding Yishi Arrogantly Reactionary, Denouncing Everything

(Our dispatch) The staff of the Han Opera Troupe of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are exposing and criticizing the rightist Ding Yishi, the director of the troupe. After he was transferred from Beijing to work in Xinjiang last autumn, he styled himself as an "art master," saying that "none of the Autonomous Region Party Committee understands literature and art, they are uneducated and boorish."

He also slandered that "Xinjiang has no revolutionary flavor at all," and that none of the Han cadres working here are good people, and they all have Han chauvinist ideas.

During the period of blooming and contending, Ding Yishi became even more arrogant. He said, "Many things in our country have started to go bad from the State Council, and have gone bad all the way down."

    丁一石狂妄反动骂倒一切
    本报讯  新疆维吾尔自治区汉族话剧团的工作人员正在揭露和批判剧团导演右派分子丁一石。去年秋天，他从北京调到新疆工作后，就以“艺术大师”自居，说什么“自治区党委没有一个懂文艺的，不学无术，土里土气。” 
    他还诬蔑“新疆没有一点革命味道”，在这里工作的汉族干部没有一个好人，都有大汉族主义思想。
    鸣放期间，丁一石倍加嚣张。他说：“我国有许多事情都是从国务院坏起，一直坏到下边。”
