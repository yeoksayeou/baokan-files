“Knowledge is Power” Publishes Special Issue

    To celebrate the October Revolution and the achievements of our country’s First Five-Year Plan, the Soviet and Chinese editorial departments of the “Knowledge is Power” magazine have jointly compiled the October special issue of “Knowledge is Power.” The content is mainly divided into two parts: “Under the Banner of October” and “Advancing Shoulder to Shoulder.” The first part introduces some historical fragments of the Soviet Kirov Factory from the time of the birth of the Soviet regime, reflecting the entire path of Soviet industrialization. The second part narrates the creative labor of the Chinese people alongside the Soviet people along the road of socialism, reflecting our country's construction achievements and the selfless assistance of the Soviet people to us, and powerfully refuting the fallacies of the rightists who undermine Sino-Soviet friendship. This special issue will be published separately in Moscow and Beijing.
