Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: The capital's political and legal circles held a meeting today attended by 4,000 people, criticizing the reactionary words and deeds of the right-wing clique headed by Lou Bangyan, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice. According to the materials revealed at the meeting, it was proven that this clique was a component of the Zhang-Luo alliance.

　　Chang Zhen, Director of the General Office of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice, first systematically exposed the criminal activities of Lou Bangyan and his clique members Chen Jianguo, Guo Kehong, Zhao Weihou, Zhu Ping, and others at the meeting. Chang Zhen pointed out: After the rectification campaign began, Lou Bangyan actively incited the masses to make "great democracy." He openly said: "Gentle breeze and fine rain are for you communists, and non-Party cadres are not subject to this restriction." "If non-Party cadres also emphasize gentle breeze and fine rain, it will make them have concerns and dare not offer opinions to the Party." Lou Bangyan also openly advocated taking the so-called "contradictions" in the political and legal circles "to the streets." He said that if the Party group prevented such actions, it would be hindering "the masses from offering opinions to the Party."

　　Chang Zhen said: The activities of the Lou Bangyan clique were part of the Zhang-Luo alliance's conspiracy to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party and seize leadership power nationwide. The reactionary clique of Lou Bangyan and the anti-communist group of Qian Duansheng, Lou Bangyan, and Wang Tieya under the leadership of the Zhang-Luo alliance were closely related. The latter was an anti-communist fortress of the Zhang-Luo alliance in the political and legal circles. They conspired to seize the Party's leadership in the political and legal circles and attempted to organize a "Great Law School." Chang Zhen revealed that Lou Bangyan also had connections with right-wing elements such as Chu Anping, Pu Xixiu, and Fei Xiaotong.

　　Chang Zhen said: The activities of the Lou Bangyan clique were theoretical, purposeful, and had propositions. They slandered that our country has no democracy and freedom, and stated that in order to "fight for democracy and freedom," they were prepared to shed blood and sacrifice. They slandered our legal system as having slow legislation, with no laws to follow, and damaged the legal system. They completely negated the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement. They opposed judicial reform and the appointment of Party member cadres as leading figures in the political and legal circles under the guise of opposing sectarianism. They vainly attempted to prove that the root of all errors was in the Communist Party, so the Communist Party must be overthrown.

　　Many people at the meeting systematically criticized and exposed the program and propositions of this clique.

　　Zheng Mengping, Deputy Director of the Second Legal Advisory Office of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Lawyers Association, cited a large number of facts to illustrate that our country now has unprecedentedly broad democracy and freedom. He said: The rightists do not recognize these democracy and freedom, but also want to strive for democracy and freedom. What kind of democracy and freedom do they need? Let them answer for themselves! Lou Bangyan once said: "I am enthusiastic about the lively and colorful scenes of bourgeois democracy." During the period of blooming and contending, rightist Chen Jianguo happily said "it was satisfied," "that is democracy." Obviously, what they need is anti-communist and anti-socialist "democracy and freedom." They want to use such democracy and freedom to discredit and defeat the Communist Party.

　　Ma Runsheng, Director of the Criminal Tribunal of the Beijing Higher People's Court, pointed out: According to incomplete statistics, since the founding of the country in 1949, our country has promulgated more than 4,000 laws, decrees, and separate regulations, including the fundamental law of the state, the Constitution, and many important laws. How can it be said that "legislation is slow and there are no laws to follow"? Ma Runsheng said that Lou Bangyan once said that after the Three-Anti and Five-Anti movements, Beijing Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu instructed the court to severely punish corrupt elements according to law, which was "replacing the government with the Party" and "interfering with the trial" because Zhang Youyu was a member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC. Ma Runsheng said: According to the provisions of the Provisional Regulations on the Organization of the People's Courts at that time, the People's Court was under the dual leadership of the higher-level court and the people's government at the same level. At that time, Zhang Youyu was the Deputy Mayor and the Director of the Beijing Municipal Political and Legal Committee. It was completely legal for him to give instructions on the work of the court in either capacity. Even if he, in the capacity of a member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC, issued instructions to the Party members or Party organizations in the court to ensure the specific and effective implementation of state laws, what's wrong with that?

　　Zhu Yuhuang, a teacher at the Central Political and Legal Cadre School, said: Another argument of the rightists like Lou Bangyan who attacked the people's legal system is that we use "policies instead of laws," in an attempt to prove that we have no laws, and to offset the legislative work of the past eight years. Zhu Yuhuang said: "This conspiracy of the rightists is in vain. We attach great importance to the law, but we do not believe that the law is omnipotent. Therefore, we believe that even if there is a law, in order to adapt to the complex situation of class relations and social production in our country, there must be corresponding policies as guidance. This is to better implement the law. Taking the suppression of counter-revolutionaries as an example: Before the formulation of the Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, our struggle against counter-revolutionaries was guided by the policy of combining suppression with leniency, punishing the ringleaders, not questioning those who were coerced, and rewarding those who made meritorious service. After the Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries were formulated, these policies still guided us to correctly apply the law, and adapted to the changes in the balance of class forces. At different times, corresponding policies were put forward to guide the implementation of these regulations, which more forcefully disintegrated the enemy and was more conducive to the socialist cause.

　　Yu Yue, a judge of the Beijing Intermediate Court, pointed out in his speech: In order to achieve their sinister purpose of seizing the tools of dictatorship, the rightists such as Lou Bangyan tried their best to oppose judicial reform in the name of anti-sectarianism. Lou Bangyan said: "In the past, the old intellectuals in the political and legal circles were treated with a 'one-size-fits-all' approach. In the past, we were completely negated in two aspects: first, the entire history of intellectuals in the political and legal circles was negated, and second, the entire scientific knowledge of the political and legal circles was negated." Yu Yue said: Law is the concentrated expression of the will of a certain class, and a powerful weapon for a class to protect itself. The old laws served the reactionary ruling class. The so-called upright people in the judicial personnel of the old society were also very few. Most of them were corrupt, perverted the law, extorted, and did everything. They directly acted as tools for the reactionary ruling class to rule the people. Without thorough transformation, it is impossible to engage in people's judicial work. From this, it can be seen that the reactionary state view and legal view of all reactionary ruling classes, and all the laws, decrees, and judicial systems of the Kuomintang reactionary government that oppressed the people must be negated, abolished, and the old judicial personnel must be thoroughly transformed. Yu Yue said: I myself came from a bureaucratic family and served as a pseudo-judge for six years. If the People's Government treated the old judicial personnel like Lou Bangyan said, with a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, I would have been beaten to death long ago! But I have never left the trial work in the past eight years!

　　Gong Xiangrui, a professor at Peking University, exposed Lou Bangyan's consistent ugly history of anti-communism and anti-people in his speech. Gong Xiangrui said: In Lou Bangyan's half-life of ugly history, there are at least three active anti-communist actions. The first time was in 1934, when Lou Bangyan took off his scholar's coat, put down the airs of a professor, and joined Hu Zongnan's communist suppression army as a "political instructor." The second time was in 1947, when he engaged in the so-called "middle road" in Beijing. In fact, in 1946, he also taught classes for two months at the cadre school in Chongqing of the Sanqing Tuan, which specialized in training secret agents and youth army cadres, and drank and danced with Chiang Ching-kuo. In 1947, the People's Liberation War had reached a decisive stage of victory, and Chiang Kai-shek's regime was completely溃烂 and beyond repair. Lou Bangyan also offered suggestions to Chiang Kai-shek, advocating firmly fighting the civil war and not having the intention of constitutionalism. The constitution could not solve the problem, and the Communist Party should be beaten hard. The third anti-communist conspiracy was this time, under the guise of helping the Party rectify its work, following the anti-communist and anti-people offensive launched by the Zhang-Luo alliance. But this time his failure was even greater.

　　The speakers refuted Lou Bangyan's clique's fallacies one by one, and Lou Bangyan's true colors could no longer be concealed. At the request of the masses, he stepped onto the stage, but his "self-criticism" was empty and had no specific content, which caused great indignation among the people present.

　　打垮右派分子对人民法制的进攻
　　首都政法界驳倒楼邦彦
    据新华社13日讯  首都政法界今天举行了有四千人参加的大会，批判以北京市司法局副局长楼邦彦为首的右派小集团的反动言行。根据会上所揭发的材料，证明这个小集团是章罗联盟的一个组成部分。
    北京市司法局办公室主任常真首先在会上系统地揭露了楼邦彦及其小集团成员陈建国、郭可宏、赵威侯、朱平等人的罪恶活动。常真指出：在整风开始后，楼邦彦就积极地煽动群众闹“大民主”，他公然说：“和风细雨是对你们共产党说的，非党干部不受这个限制”，
  “如果非党干部也强调和风细雨的话，就会使他们有顾虑，不敢对党提意见”。楼邦彦还公开主张把政法界的所谓“矛盾”到“大马路上去讲”，他说，如党组阻止这样行动，就是阻碍“群众对党提意见”。
    常真说：楼邦彦小集团的活动是章罗联盟阴谋在全国范围内反对共产党的领导、夺取领导权的一部分。楼邦彦反动小集团和章罗联盟领导下的钱端升、楼邦彦、王铁崖反共集团有密切联系的。而后者是章罗联盟在政法界的一个反共堡垒，他们阴谋夺取党在政法界的领导权，妄图组织一个“大法学院”。常真揭露了楼邦彦还与储安平、浦熙修、费孝通等右派分子有联系。
    常真说：楼邦彦这个小集团活动是有理论、有主张和有目的的，他们污蔑我们国家没有民主自由，并表示为了“争取民主、自由”，准备流血牺牲。他们污蔑我们的法制是立法迟缓，无法可依，破坏了法制。他们全部否定了肃反运动。他们借反对宗派主义为名反对司法改革，反对党员干部充当政法界领导骨干。他们妄想以这样活动来证明一切错误根源是在共产党，因此必须把共产党推下台。
    会上许多人对这个小集团的纲领和主张进行了系统的批判和揭露。
    北京市律师协会筹委会第二法律顾问处副主任郑孟平引用大量事实说明现在我们国家具有历史上空前广泛的民主和自由，他说：右派分子不承认这些民主和自由，还要争取民主自由，他们需要什么民主自由呢？请听他们自己回答吧！楼邦彦曾说过：“我热衷于轰轰烈烈、五花八门资产阶级民主热烈场面。”大鸣大放期间出现了一些谬论，右派分子陈建国高兴地说“得到了满足”，“才是民主”。显而易见，他们所需的是反共反社会主义的“民主自由”，他们想以这样的民主和自由把共产党搞臭，搞垮。
    北京市高级人民法院刑庭庭长马润生指出：据不完全统计，自1949年建国以来我们国家颁布的法律、法令及单行法规就有四千多件，其中有国家根本大法宪法，也有许多重要法律，这怎么能说“立法迟缓，无法可依”呢？马润生说，楼邦彦曾说北京市副市长张友渔在三反五反后，指示法院对贪污分子依法从重处理，是“以党代政”“干涉审判”，因为张友渔是中共北京市委委员。马润生说：根据当时人民法院组织暂行条例的规定，人民法院受上级法院和同级人民政府双重领导。当时，张友渔是副市长又是北京市政法委员会主任，他无论以那种身份对法院工作作出指示，都是完全合法的。即使他以中共北京市委委员的身份向法院党员或党组织发出指示，保证国家法令具体有效地贯彻执行，这又有什么不可以呢？
    中央政法干校教员朱育璜说：楼邦彦等右派分子攻击人民法制的另一论调，是说我们以“政策代替法律”，妄图以此来证明我们是没有法律的，以此来抵消八年来的立法工作。朱育璜说：“右派分子这个阴谋是枉然的，我们十分重视法律，但不是迷信法律万能的。因此我们认为即便有了法律，为了适应我国阶级关系和社会生产的复杂情况，还必须有相应的政策为指导。这样做是为了更好地贯彻执行法律。以镇反为例：我们和反革命的斗争在制定惩治反革命条例以前，就是根据镇压与宽大相结合，首恶必办、胁从不问、立功受奖等政策为指导的。而在制订了惩治反革命条例以后，这些政策仍然指导我们正确地运用法律，而且适应着阶级力量对比的变化，在不同时期又提出了相应的政策来指导这一条例的贯彻执行，这样就更有力的分化瓦解了敌人，更有利于社会主义事业。
    北京市中级法院审判员余樾在发言中指出：楼邦彦等右派分子为了达到他们夺取专政工具的罪恶目的，以反宗派主义的名义极力反对司法改革。楼邦彦说：“过去对政法界旧知识分子是采取了一棍子打死的办法。过去我们遭到了两个方面的彻底否定，一是政法界知识分子全部历史被否定，二是政法界的全部科学知识被否定。”余樾说：法律是一定阶级意志的集中表现，是一个阶级保护自己的有力武器。旧的法律是为反动统治阶级服务的。而旧社会的司法人员所谓正派人也是很少的，绝大部分都是贪赃枉法、敲榨勒索，无所不为。他们直接充当反动统治阶级统治人民的工具，如果不经过彻底改造是不可能从事人民司法工作的。由此可见，一切反动统治阶级的反动国家观、法律观，国民党反动政府的一切压迫人民的法律、法令和司法制度必须否定，必须废除，旧司法人员必须彻底改造。余樾说：我自己是官僚家庭出身，曾当了六年伪法官，如果人民政府对旧司法人员像楼邦彦所说的是一棍子打死的话，那我早就被打死了！但是我八年来始终没有脱离审判工作！
    北京大学教授龚祥瑞在发言中揭露了楼邦彦一贯反共反人民的丑恶历史，龚祥瑞说：在楼邦彦半生丑恶的历史中，至少有三次积极反共的行动。第一次是在1934年，楼邦彦在重庆脱掉了学者的外衣，放下了教授的架子，投奔到胡宗南的剿共军队里充当“政治总教官”。第二次是1947年，他在北京搞所谓“中间路线”。实际上，1946年他还在重庆三青团专门训练特务和青年军的干部学校里讲了两个月的课，和蒋经国喝酒跳舞。1947年人民解放战争已到了决定胜利的阶段，蒋介石政权完全溃烂得不可收拾了，楼邦彦还向蒋介石献策，主张坚决打内战，不要有行宪的打算，宪法解决不了问题，要狠狠的打共产党。第三次反共阴谋就是这次在借帮助党整风的牌子下，跟随着章、罗联盟发起的反共反人民的进攻。但是这一次他的失败更大。
    发言的人把楼邦彦小集团的谬论一一驳斥得体无完肤，楼邦彦的原形再也无法掩藏了。在群众的要求下他走上台，但是他的“检讨”却空空洞洞，没有具体内容，引起到会的人很大的愤慨。
