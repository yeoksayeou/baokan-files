In Colombia, there is an art that is ravaged by imperialists, unseen in the films, radio, and television of colonial rulers, but alive in the hearts of the people. That is the traditional song and dance art of the Colombian native people. Colombian folk art, like the fate of the working people in that region, has been consistently discriminated against and destroyed by imperialists. However, Colombian folk art has stubbornly existed and been passed down among the people, accompanying their lives and struggles. We are very grateful to Manuel Zapata and his siblings and their folk song and dance troupe for visiting China and performing for us, enabling us to come into contact with these simple folk song and dance arts that reflect the spiritual outlook of the Colombian people, and helping us to further understand the working people of Colombia.

The history of the Colombian Delia Zapata Olivella Folk Song and Dance Troupe is inseparable from the Colombian national independence movement. At the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing in 1952, a policy was adopted: to develop the folk art of the people in colonies and semi-colonies as a form of promoting the national independence struggle. This song and dance troupe was formed in accordance with the spirit of this policy. For more than four years, the leaders of the troupe traveled to rural areas where typical folk songs and dances are still preserved. After learning these songs and dances, they returned to the cities and taught them to young workers. In this way, they organized more than five hundred Colombian youths and formed four song and dance troupes in four regions. The song and dance troupe performing today consists of the thirteen most outstanding dancers and musicians from these groups who attended the Sixth World Festival of Youth and Students.

Our country has always attached importance to folk traditional art and has always respected the folk traditional art of all countries, because in these folk arts, the life and spirit of a nation are genuinely filled with the wisdom of the working people and the crystallization of traditional culture. This is precisely what makes the performances of the Colombian Folk Song and Dance Troupe precious and deeply moving to us. In the eleven dances and seven musical programs they performed, there is a healthy, unrestrained, and optimistic spirit everywhere, reflecting the diligence, bravery, kindness, and other aspects of the people's character. They are good at using the movements of every part of the body, especially the swaying of the torso, to convey passion with unrestrained body language, and to express thoughts with songs, words, and loud shouts. These dances and music are often very enthusiastic. Among these programs, the "Palm Weaving Dance" and the "Farato Indian Dance" are both dances of the Colombian Indian Garibi tribe living along the Atlantic coast, and are one of the few surviving legacies of ancient times. The former praises the art of weaving. The dancers cleverly weave colored cloth strips around the palm tree using collective dance movements, and then methodically unravel the strips in the dance. This dance not only has changes in composition, but also changes in speed, becoming increasingly frenzied, fully expressing the wisdom and beautiful imagination of the ancient people. The "Farato Indian Dance" is danced before they go on expeditions. We can see how the women of this expeditionary tribe bless the men who are going to war, and they dance with a confidence in victory before the expedition. The emotions of the men are also optimistic, and everywhere we can see their pride in fighting for the safety of the tribe's women and the happiness of the tribe.

The dance drama "The Bleeding Hoda" is also a dance full of resistance, which Delia Zapata adapted from a peasant dance. It tells the story of a peasant who kills the tyrannical landlord's henchman in order to protect his wife. The Chinese audience warmly welcomed this dance, expressing the Chinese people's sympathy for the Colombian people with thunderous applause and repeated requests for an encore.

Most appealing is the "Drum Soul Dance" performed by choreographer Delia Zapata herself. This is choreographed based on an African legend. According to legend, every drum hides a drum spirit. In this dance, the performer approaches the drum sound that attracts her. When she listens to the drum sound, she wants to understand the language of the drum spirit with her dance. When the drum spirit knows that she understands their language, they become furious. In this dance, Delia Zapata performs according to the complex rhythms of five drums of different sizes and pitches, sometimes passionately, sometimes gently and delicately, and sometimes with fear and panic. She conveys the emotions of the drum sound so well that it feels like not only the performer herself, but also the audience understands the thoughts and feelings of the drum spirit.

The performance and singing of Colombian folk musical instruments are also full of the spirit of the people. Although the instruments are simple in structure, they express rich emotions in a special mode. Many instruments are made by the working people themselves in their lives, and many percussion and rhythm instruments have a strong folk style.

Seeing these performances makes people feel closer to the profound soul of this lovely nation. We sincerely hope that the Colombian Delia Zapata Olivella Folk Song and Dance Troupe will make more achievements and greater contributions, use song and dance art to safeguard the dignity of the Colombian people, and further consolidate the friendship of peace-loving people in the world.

　　争取独立自由的哥伦比亚民间歌舞
　　叶林
    在哥伦比亚，有一种为帝国主义者所摧残、在殖民地统治者们的电影、广播和电视中所看不到、但却活在人们心坎里的艺术，那就是哥伦比亚本地人民的传统歌舞艺术。哥伦比亚的民间艺术正和那个地区的劳动人民的命运一样，是受到帝国主义者一贯歧视和摧残的。但是，哥伦比亚的民间艺术伴随着人民的生活与斗争，顽强地存在着，在人民当中流传下来。这次，我们非常感谢麦努埃尔·萨巴达兄妹和他们的民间歌舞团来中国访问演出，使我们能够接触这些纯朴的、反映着哥伦比亚人民的精神面貌的民间歌舞艺术，帮助我们对哥伦比亚的劳动人民得到进一步的了解。
    哥伦比亚黛丽雅·萨巴达·奥丽维娅民间歌舞团的历史是和哥伦比亚的民族独立斗争运动分不开的。1952年在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议上曾经通过了一项方针：发展殖民地和半殖民地人民的民间艺术，以作为推动民族独立斗争的形式之一。这个歌舞团就是根据这项方针的精神组成的。四年多以来，这个团的领导人走遍了还保存着典型民间歌曲与舞蹈的农村，他们学会了这些歌曲与舞蹈以后，回到城市里再教给青年工人。这样他们就组织了五百多个哥伦比亚青年，在四个地区里组成了四个歌舞团。今天来演出的这个歌舞团就是由其中的十三个出席第六届青年联欢节的最优秀的舞蹈家、音乐家组成的。
    我们的国家一贯重视民间传统艺术，并且一贯尊重各国人民的民间传统艺术，因为在这些民间艺术里面，从不虚假地洋溢着一个民族的生活风貌和精神风貌，充满着劳动人民的智慧与传统文化的结晶。哥伦比亚民间歌舞团的演出使我们觉得珍贵和深受感动的，也正是这一点。在他们演出的十一个舞蹈和七个音乐节目里面，到处充满着健康、奔放和乐观的气质，反映着人民的勤劳、勇敢和善良等多方面的性格。他们善于运用全身每一个部位的动作，特别是躯干的摆动，用奔放的体态来传达激情，用歌声、语言和高声呼喝来表达思想，这些舞蹈和音乐往往都是十分热烈的。在这些节目中，“棕榈纺织舞”和“法拉托印地安舞”都是居住在大西洋沿岸的哥伦比亚印地安加里比部落的一种舞蹈，是古代的仅存的遗产之一。前者歌颂了纺织艺术，舞蹈者非常巧妙地围着棕榈用集体舞蹈的动作把彩色布条编织在树干上，然后又依次有条不紊地在舞蹈中把布条松解开来。这个舞蹈不仅有着构图上的变化，而且还有速度的变化，越来越狂烈，充分表达了古代人民的智慧与美丽的想像。“法拉托印地安舞”则是他们在出征前跳的，我们可以看到这个出征部落的妇女如何地为出征的男子祝福，和他们跳着出征前的充满胜利信心的舞蹈，而男子汉们的情绪也是乐观的，到处都可以看到他们为保卫部落妇女的安全和部落的幸福而战的自豪心。
    舞剧“流血的霍达”也是一个富有反抗性的舞蹈，是黛丽雅·萨巴达根据一个农民舞蹈加工改编的。它叙说着一个农民为保护他的妻子而杀死横暴的地主狗腿子的故事。中国观众热烈地欢迎这个舞蹈，用狂烈的掌声和一再要求重演来表示中国人民对哥伦比亚人民的同情。
    最使人爱好的还有编舞者黛丽雅·萨巴达自己表演的“鼓魂舞”。这是根据非洲的一个传说编导的。据传说，每个鼓里都隐藏着一个鼓神，在这舞蹈中，表演者走近吸引她的鼓声，当她倾听了鼓声的时候，她想以她的舞蹈来了解鼓神的语言，当众鼓神知道她懂得他们的语言时，就大发雷霆。在这舞蹈中，黛丽雅·萨巴达根据五个大小不同和音高不同的鼓的复杂节奏来表演，有时是狂热激情，有时是轻柔细腻，有时是畏惧恐慌。她把鼓声的感情传达得这样好，使人觉得不仅是表演者自己，而且观众也同样懂得了鼓神的思想感情。
    哥伦比亚民间乐器的演奏和歌唱也同样是充满了人民精神的。乐器虽然构造简单，但却用一种特殊的调式表达了丰富的感情。好些乐器都是劳动人民在生活中自己编制出来的，好些打击乐器和节奏乐器都有着浓厚的民间风格。
    看到了这些节目的演出，使人感到进一步地亲近了这个可爱民族的深邃的灵魂。我们衷心地希望哥伦比亚黛丽雅·萨巴达·奥丽维娅民间歌舞团作出更多的成绩和更大的贡献，用歌舞艺术来维护哥伦比亚人民的尊严，使世界爱好和平的人们的友谊得到进一步的巩固。
