Xinhua News Agency, September 5th, Tokyo dispatch: A Tokyo "Mainichi Shimbun" correspondent in Washington reported on the 4th regarding the growing impact in Western countries of the Soviet Union's successful launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile, saying that the Soviet Union's announcement of the successful launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile poses a serious threat to the "policy of strength" advocated by the United States for Western European countries in dealing with the Soviet Union. The Western European policy, which has always been based on military power surpassing Russia, appears to be fundamentally shaken.

The reporter said that European diplomats in Washington unanimously believe that the policy proposed by US Secretary of State Dulles on behalf of Western European countries is now facing "the most difficult situation since the beginning of the Cold War."

    苏联洲际火箭出现西方实力政策破产
    一日本记者的看法
    据新华社5日讯　东京消息：东京“每日新闻”的一位驻华盛顿记者4日报道苏联发射洲际弹道火箭成功在西方国家所引起的愈来愈大的影响说，苏联宣布它已经发射成功一枚洲际弹道火箭，这对美国所主张的西欧国家对付苏联的“实力”政策已经成为一个严重的威胁。一向以军事力量超过俄国为基础的西欧政策看起来将根本动摇了。
    这位记者说，在华盛顿的欧洲外交人员一致认为，美国国务卿杜勒斯所提出的代表西欧国家的政策现在正在面临“自从冷战开始以来最困难的局面”。
