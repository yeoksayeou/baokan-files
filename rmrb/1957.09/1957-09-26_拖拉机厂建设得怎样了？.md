Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, 24th -- The construction project of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant has been underway for a full two years by mid-September. Currently, the massive factory's appearance has emerged on the land that was still a wilderness two years ago. Over 70% of the factory's civil engineering construction has been completed; most of the main production workshops and important buildings have been erected. Approximately 20% of the machinery and equipment have also been installed.

　　Among the factory's eleven main production workshops, the auxiliary, woodworking, non-ferrous metal repair casting, and forging workshops have already been put into production. The workshop for manufacturing tractor engines has also recently begun installing machinery and equipment and will begin producing engines ahead of schedule next year.

    拖拉机厂建设得怎样了？
    新华社洛阳24日电　第一拖拉机制造厂的建设工程到9月中旬已经进行整整两年了。目前，规模巨大的工厂的外貌已在两年前还是一片原野的土地上展现出来。全厂的土木建筑工程量有70％以上已经完成了；大部分生产主厂房和重要的建筑物已经建设起来。机器设备也安装好了20％左右。
    在全厂十一个生产主厂房中，有辅助、木工，有色修铸、锻工等工场已经投入生产。制造拖拉机发动机的工场，也在最近开始安装机器设备，明年就将提前生产发动机。
