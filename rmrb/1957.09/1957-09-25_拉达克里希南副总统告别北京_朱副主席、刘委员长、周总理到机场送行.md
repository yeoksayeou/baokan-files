Xinhua News Agency, September 24th. Indian Republic Vice President Dr. Radhakrishnan and his entourage left Beijing by special plane this morning. The Vice President, accompanied by Vice Chairman Guo Moruo and Ambassador R.K. Nehru, will visit Shanghai and other places before returning home.

　　At 8:35 a.m., Vice President Radhakrishnan and Vice Chairman Zhu De arrived at the airport in the same car. At the entrance of the airport, the Vice President shook hands with Chinese state leaders one by one. They were: Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Luo Ronghuan, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Vice Premiers He Long, Chen Yi, President Dong Biwu, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, and Vice Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, Burhan.

　　After Vice President Radhakrishnan, accompanied by Vice Chairman Zhu De, reviewed the honor guard of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, he also met and bid farewell to the heads of various departments of the Chinese state organs, various democratic parties, people's organizations, and generals, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries to China.

　　Vice Chairman Zhu De delivered a speech at the airport to bid farewell to the distinguished guest. He said: "During His Excellency the Vice President's stay in our capital, he held cordial talks with Chinese state leaders, met with people from all walks of life, visited our cultural and educational institutions, and delivered speeches. All of this has greatly helped to further enhance the understanding and friendly cooperative relations between the Chinese and Indian peoples. This outstanding statesman and scholar from our great neighbor India has left a deep impression on the Chinese people during his short time with us. This visit is a major event in the history of Sino-Indian friendly relations."

　　Vice Chairman Zhu De wished the Vice President a safe journey and good health, and asked the Vice President to convey the cordial greetings of the Chinese people to our dear Indian brothers.

　　Vice Chairman Zhu De concluded by wishing that the friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples will develop day by day, and hailed the solidarity of Asia and Africa and world peace.

　　Subsequently, Vice President Radhakrishnan delivered a farewell speech. He said: "A six-day stay in Beijing is too short to truly get to know the leaders and people of this country. As the Vice Chairman said, I have held talks with your main leaders and visited some of your cultural and artistic institutions, and have therefore begun to admire and understand the work you are doing."

　　The Vice President said: "I believe that the great achievement of New China is the change it has brought to the people's psychology. A nation that was depressed, gloomy, and frustrated because its self-esteem was damaged has today become a nation that stands tall and yearns to build their new country. While they are eager to achieve modern progress, they do not disregard the value of what they have inherited, which is humanism, reason, acceptance of new ideas, and making changes according to the needs of the situation."

　　The Vice President said: "Leaves will wither and fall, but as long as the roots are strong and firm, the tree will grow. China's roots are strong and firm. When I spoke to the leaders and some representatives I had the honor of meeting here, I found them as sensitive to China's classical spirit as they are to the modern progress they have made."

　　The Vice President said: "We have spent six very pleasant and happy days here, and the impressions we have gained will be unforgettable for the rest of our lives."

　　The Vice President concluded by saying: "Mr. Vice Chairman, I must convey the greetings of your government and people to my country, and wish you all pleasant and continuous progress on the road to a modern, independent, free, humane, and socialist country."

　　At the end of his speech, Vice President Radhakrishnan warmly embraced Vice Chairman Zhu De.

　　Finally, Vice Chairman Zhu, Chairman Liu, Premier Zhou and others accompanied the Vice President to the front of the plane. Here, the Vice President once again shook hands with his hosts to say goodbye. The Vice President also stood at the door of the cabin, facing the bright sunshine, and bowed to the well-wishers with his palms together.

　　The special plane left Beijing Airport at nine o'clock.

    拉达克里希南副总统告别北京
    朱副主席、刘委员长、周总理到机场送行
    新华社24日讯　印度共和国副总统拉达克里希南博士和随行人员今天上午乘专机离开北京。副总统由郭沫若副委员长和拉·库·尼赫鲁大使陪同，将在上海等地参观后回国。
    上午八时三十五分，拉达克里希南副总统和朱德副主席同乘一车到达机场。在机场的入口处，副总统同我国国家领导人一一握手。他们是：刘少奇委员长，周恩来总理，李济深、罗荣桓、沈钧儒、黄炎培、彭真副委员长，贺龙、陈毅副总理，董必武院长，张鼎丞检察长，政协全国委员会包尔汉副主席。
    副总统由朱德副主席陪同检阅了陆海空三军仪仗队以后，还同我国国家机关各部门、各民主党派、各人民团体的负责人和将军们，以及各国驻中国使节会见告别。
    朱德副主席在机场上致词欢送贵宾。他说：“副总统阁下在我国首都期间，同我国国家领导人进行了亲切的会谈，同各界人士见了面，参观了我国的文化教育机构并且发表了演讲。这一切对于进一步增进中印两国人民之间的了解和友好合作关系都有很大帮助。我们伟大邻邦印度的这位杰出的政治家和学者，在同我们相处不长的时间里，给中国人民留下了深刻的印象。他这次访问是中印友好关系史上的一件大事。”
    朱德副主席祝副总统一路平安，身体健康，并请副总统把中国人民的亲切问候带给亲爱的印度弟兄们。
    朱德副主席最后祝中印两国人民的友谊日益发展，欢呼亚非团结和世界和平万岁。
    接着，拉达克里希南副总统发表了告别讲话。他说：“在北京的六天逗留，如果说要同这个国家的领导人和人民真正熟识，那是太短暂了。正如副主席所说的那样，我同你们的主要领导人举行了会谈，并且参观了你们的一些文化和艺术机关，因此开始钦佩和了解你们正在进行的工作。”
    副总统说：“我认为，新中国的伟大成就是它所带来的人民心理的改变。一个因为自尊心受到损伤而情绪低沉的忧郁、烦闷和受挫折的民族，今天变成了一个挺起胸膛、渴望建设他们的新国家的民族了。他们虽然渴望实现现代的进展，但是他们并不漠视他们所继承下来的东西的价值，那就是人道主义、理性、接受新思想和根据情况的需要作出改变。”
    副总统说：“树叶会枯萎和雕落，但是只要树根健壮和坚强，树就会生长下去。中国的根是健壮和坚强的。当我向我有幸在这里会见的领袖们和一些代表们讲话的时候，我发现他们对中国的古典精神是很敏感的，正像他们对他们取得的现代进步很敏感一样。”
    副总统说：“我们在这里度过了非常愉快和高兴的六天，我们获得的印象将终生不忘。”
    副总统最后说：“副主席先生，我一定要把贵国政府和人民对我国的致意转达给我国政府和人民，并祝诸位在走向一个现代、独立、自由、人道和社会主义国家的道路上取得愉快的和不断的进展。”
    拉达克里希南副总统在讲话结束的时候，同朱德副主席亲切地拥抱。
    最后，朱副主席、刘委员长和周总理等一直送副总统到飞机前面。在这里，副总统再一次同主人们握手道别。副总统并站在机舱门口，迎着灿烂的阳光向欢送者合十致意。
    专机在九时离开北京机场。
