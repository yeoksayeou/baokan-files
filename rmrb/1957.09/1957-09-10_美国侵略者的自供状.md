A Confession by American Aggressors
By a staff commentator of this newspaper

    Dulles' statement on September 7, after a meeting with Eisenhower and Henderson concerning the Middle East situation, is a written confession of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Syria. It further exposes the U.S.'s desperate preparation for armed intervention in Syria.

    Past facts have proven that when U.S. imperialism launches aggression, or plots aggressive military blocs and military schemes, it always brings out the United Nations Charter as a signboard. Now, the U.S. is again using the UN Charter to cover up its aggression against Syria. Dulles' statement said that Eisenhower assessed the situation from the perspective of the UN Charter, because the UN Charter stipulates that Syria has no right to use force except for self-defense.

    We Chinese people are very familiar with Dulles' tune, because the U.S. has consistently used the so-called "no use of force" requirement to interfere in China's internal affairs, forcibly occupy China's Taiwan, and falsely accuse the Chinese people's opposition to U.S. aggression and liberation of their own territory of Taiwan as so-called "aggression." The U.S. is now using this trick on Syria, with the aim of portraying Syria as a so-called "potential aggressor" so that the U.S. can arbitrarily intervene.

    But Syria, like China, has not committed any "aggression" against any country, but is resisting U.S. aggression. Dulles' statement itself proves that it is not Syria, but the U.S. itself, that is violating the UN Charter.

    First, the U.S. blatantly and rudely interferes in Syria's internal affairs. In his statement, Dulles insists that there is some kind of "Soviet Communist control over Syria" and hypocritically says something like "hoping that international communists will not urge Syria to take any aggressive actions against its neighbors." Regarding Dulles' nonsense, Syrian President Kuwatly gave the clearest possible answer on the same day. Kuwatly said: "Our relations with the Soviet Union are friendly, sincere, and based on mutual benefit. ... We are not communists, and no one wants us to become communists. We are nationalists, and we will not exchange Arab nationalism for anything else."

    It is quite obvious that the truth of the Syrian situation cannot be distorted by Dulles. Regardless of the domestic situation in Syria, it is Syria's internal affair. On what basis does the U.S. government interfere in Syria's internal affairs? U.S. interference in Syria's internal affairs constitutes a violation of Syria's independence. This is a serious violation of the UN Charter.

    In his statement, Dulles unreservedly admits that the reason why the U.S. insists on portraying Syrian nationalism as so-called "international communism" and falsely accusing Syria of carrying out "aggression" is to prepare an excuse for the U.S. to carry out direct military intervention in Syria based on the "Eisenhower Doctrine." The U.S. is deeply disturbed by the far-reaching impact of Syria's policy of adhering to national independence on its surrounding neighbors, and is therefore determined to eliminate Syria and at the same time suppress the national independence movements in Syria's neighbors. It is precisely for this dual purpose that Dulles stated that the U.S. intends to implement the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and use U.S. armed forces to carry out direct intervention "when necessary." It is also precisely for this dual purpose that the U.S. is stepping up the delivery of weapons to countries surrounding Syria, especially Jordan, which is the most convenient for attacking Syria but where nationalist forces are still quite strong. It is particularly noteworthy that Dulles' statement implies that the U.S. may use Syria's "threat" to its neighbors as an excuse for direct intervention, and this excuse is very easy for the U.S. to fabricate whenever it needs it.

    Dulles' statement also shows that while actively preparing for military aggression, the U.S. is not giving up on continuing to carry out subversive activities within Syria. He openly called on Syrian conspirators to "take action to eliminate" Syria's nationalist government. Dulles' unscrupulous and arrogant attitude shows the extent to which the U.S. ruling clique, which pays lip service to respecting the UN Charter, actually despises the principles of the UN Charter.

    Dulles' statement reveals, without being forced, all the ambitions of U.S. imperialism to invade Syria. However, this kind of aggressive clamor cannot scare the Syrian people. President Kuwatly said it well, "We will never allow anyone to interfere in our affairs, nor will we allow anyone to split our national front." This is the Syrian people's firm answer to the American aggressors. If the American aggressors dare to launch an aggression against Syria, they will inevitably be resolutely countered by the people of Syria, and the Arab people and the peace-loving people of the world will firmly stand on the side of the Syrian people. Those who play with fire will burn themselves. This is a serious question that American aggressors must consider carefully before setting fire in Syria.

    美国侵略者的自供状
    本报评论员
    9月7日，美国国务卿杜勒斯在同艾森豪威尔和汉德逊等就中东局势举行会议以后发表的声明，是美帝国主义侵略叙利亚的一纸自供状，它进一步暴露了美国竭力准备武装干涉叙利亚的阴谋。
    过去的许多事实已经证明，美帝国主义在发动侵略的时候，或者在策划侵略性的军事集团和军事阴谋的时候，总是要抬出联合国宪章来作为招牌。现在，美国又用联合国宪章来给美国侵略叙利亚打掩护。杜勒斯的声明说，艾森豪威尔从联合国宪章的角度估计了局势，因为联合国宪章规定，叙利亚除了自卫以外没有权利使用武力。
    我们中国人民对杜勒斯这个调子非常熟悉，因为美国一贯就是用所谓“不得使用武力”的要求来干涉中国的内政，强占中国的台湾，并且反诬中国人民反对美国侵略、解放自己领土台湾的行动是一种所谓“侵略”。美国现在把这一套花样又用在叙利亚身上，目的就是要把叙利亚说成是所谓“潜在的侵略者”，以便美国任意进行干涉。
    但是叙利亚跟中国一样，并没有对任何国家进行什么“侵略”，而是在抵抗美国的侵略。杜勒斯的声明本身就证明，违反联合国宪章的不是叙利亚，而正是美国自己。
    首先，美国公然粗暴地干涉叙利亚的内政。杜勒斯在他的声明中硬说在叙利亚有什么“苏联共产党对叙利亚的控制”，并且假惺惺地说什么“希望国际共产党人不要促使叙利亚对它的邻国采取任何侵略行动”。对于杜勒斯这种胡言乱语，叙利亚总统库阿特利在同一天给了再明确不过的答复。库阿特利说：“我们同苏联的关系是友好的，真挚的，是以互利为基础的。……我们不是共产主义者，也没有人要我们成为共产主义者。我们是民族主义者，我们不会以阿拉伯民族主义来换取其他任何东西。”
    十分明显，叙利亚局势的真相，决不是杜勒斯所能歪曲得了的。不管叙利亚国内局势如何，都是叙利亚的内政问题，美国政府凭什么来干涉叙利亚内部的事务？美国对于叙利亚内政的干涉，构成了对叙利亚独立的侵犯。这是严重违反联合国宪章的行为。
    杜勒斯在他的声明中毫不掩饰地承认，美国之所以硬要把叙利亚的民族主义说成是所谓“国际共产主义”，并且诬蔑叙利亚要进行“侵略”，是为了给美国根据“艾森豪威尔主义”对叙利亚进行直接军事干涉准备借口。美国对于叙利亚的坚持民族独立的政策在它周围邻国中所引起的深远影响十分不安，因此决心要消灭叙利亚，同时镇压叙利亚邻国中的民族独立运动。正是为了这双重目的，杜勒斯表明美国打算执行“艾森豪威尔主义”，并且“在需要时”使用美国武装部队进行直接干涉。也正是为了这双重目的，美国在加紧运武器给叙利亚周围的国家，首先是最便于进攻叙利亚而民族主义力量仍然相当强大的约旦。特别值得注意的是，杜勒斯的声明暗示，美国可能以叙利亚“威胁”它的邻国为借口进行直接干涉，而这种借口，美国在任何需要的时候都是很容易制造出来的。
    杜勒斯的声明还表明，美国在积极准备军事侵略的同时，也不放弃继续在叙利亚国内进行颠覆活动。他公然号召叙利亚的阴谋分子“用行动来消除”叙利亚的民族主义政府。杜勒斯这种肆无忌惮的狂妄态度，表明口口声声尊重联合国宪章的美国统治集团，实际上把联合国宪章原则蔑视到了何种地步。
    杜勒斯的声明，不打自招地道出了美帝国主义侵略叙利亚的全部野心。可是这种侵略叫嚣，是吓不倒叙利亚人民的。库阿特利总统说得好，“我们决不容许任何人干涉我们的事务，也不容许任何人分裂我们的民族阵线。”这是叙利亚人民对美国侵略者的坚定回答。如果美国侵略者胆敢向叙利亚发动侵略，必将遭到叙利亚举国人民的坚决回击，而阿拉伯人民和世界爱好和平的人民，都将坚决站在叙利亚人民这一边。玩火者必自焚，这是美国侵略者在叙利亚实行放火以前必须三思的严重问题。
