    Ministry of Building Materials Industry
    Anti-Rightist Ranks Grow Stronger

    (Our dispatch) The anti-Rightist ranks in the Ministry of Building Materials Industry have grown increasingly stronger. The vast majority of the masses have clarified major issues of right and wrong in the course of extensive debate, and Rightists such as Yang Derang, Gong Wanhe, An Yizhi, and Zhang Zhongsou have become completely isolated.

    Rightist Yang Derang was the deputy director of the Cement Technology Division of the Enterprise Bureau of the ministry and the organization committee member of the China Democratic League branch. During the period of "Great Blooming and Great Contending," he formed a small clique with other Rightists Huang Daneng (chairman of the China Democratic League branch) and Zhu Zupei, a Rightist in the Cement Design Institute. They used the China Democratic League organization to launch a frenzied attack on the Communist Party, openly slandering the Party's cadre policy, publicly "speaking up" and "seeking redress" for targets of the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries campaign, and cheering for the anti-communist statements of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji. After the masses exposed him, this Rightist had to admit that he was an "anti-communist and anti-socialist element who consciously, planned, and organized an attack on the Party."

    Rightist Gong Wanhe used to rely on the Japanese and the Kuomintang to ride roughshod over the people. Now that he can no longer act tyrannically as he did in the past, he said against his conscience that this society is not as good as before. Under the masses' stern criticism, Gong Wanhe had to admit that his thinking was base and dirty and that he was a complete Rightist.

    An Yizhi, who once shouted for "abolishing the security departments" and "making personnel files public" and slandered legal work, and Zhang Zhongsou, who actively supported Luo Longji's "Rehabilitation Committee," were both rendered speechless by the masses in the debate and had no choice but to bow their heads and admit their guilt.

### 建筑材料工业部  反右派队伍越来越壮大

    反右派队伍越来越壮大
    本报讯　建筑材料工业部的反右派队伍已经越来越加壮大，绝大多数群众已经在大争大辩中明确了大是大非，右派分子杨德让、宫万和、安毅之、张中叟等已经陷于完全孤立。
    右派分子杨德让是该部企业局水泥技术处的副处长、民盟支部的组织委员，在大放大鸣期间，他和另外的右派分子黄大能（民盟支部主任委员）、水泥设计院右派分子朱祖培一起结成了小集团，利用民盟组织，向共产党猖狂的进攻，公然污蔑党的干部政策，公开为肃反对象“叫屈”“伸冤”，为章伯钧、罗隆基的反共言论喝采。经过群众的揭发，这个右派分子不得不承认他是一个“有意识、有计划、有组织的向党进攻的反共反社会主义分子”。
    右派分子宫万和原来曾投靠过日本人和国民党骑在人民头上作威作福，现在他不能像过去那样横行霸道了，就昧着良心说这个社会不如从前。在群众严词驳斥下，宫万和不得不承认自己的思想是卑鄙的肮脏的，是一个十足的右派分子。
    曾经叫喊要“取消保卫部门”、“公开人事档案”，并污蔑法制工作的右派分子安毅之，以及积极支持罗隆基“平反委员会”的张中叟，在辩论会上，都被群众驳斥得张口结舌，只得低头认罪。
