    Beijing Motorcycle Race Held in Changxindian Mountain Area
    (Our report) The third Beijing Motorcycle Competition was held on September 1st in the Huai Shu Ling mountain area of Changxindian.

    At 10:12 AM, the first group of seven female motorcycle athletes left the starting line like a herd of wild horses. They were to navigate a treacherous mountain route of thirty-two kilometers, including hillside paths, sandy roads, ruts, and mud pits, before returning to the finish line. Every two minutes after the female athletes started, fifty male motorcyclists also set off in batches, running forty-eight kilometers in the same area.

    The tensest moment of the competition was in the women's group, when they rounded the twenty-four-kilometer mark. The leading rider was Shang Jiuying, a cadre from the Beijing Sports Publishing House; her driving was fast and steady. However, just four kilometers from the finish line, her throttle became blocked, and she stopped. Consequently, Chen Yitong, a fourth-year student from the Soil Chemistry Department of the Agricultural University, who was behind her, overtook her and reached the finish line first. Chen Yitong completed the thirty-two-kilometer mountain route in fifty-four minutes and one second. The winner of the men's division was Li Zhiguang from the Beijing Institute of Technology, who completed the forty-eight-kilometer route in sixty-five minutes and twenty-one seconds.

    Li Da, Director of the All-China National Defense Sports Association, visited the site to watch the competition.

    北京摩托车比赛在长辛店山区举行
    本报讯  北京市第三届摩托车比赛大会，9月1日在长辛店槐树岭山区举行。
    十点十二分，第一批七名女摩托车运动员像一群脱缰的野马，飞快地离开起点。她们要通过旁山阶道、沙路、车辙、泥坑等三十二公里的险峻山带，然后折回终点。在女运动员出发以后每隔两分钟，五十名男摩托车手也分批出发了，他们要在同一地带奔跑四十八公里。
    比赛最紧张的场面是女子组在环山绕过二十四公里的时候，跑在最前面的是北京体育出版社的干部尚久莹，她的车开得快而稳。但是在离终点只有四公里时，她的车油门被堵，停了下来。因而，被跟在她后面的农业大学土化系四年级学生陈以同赶过，首先到达终点。陈以同在三十二公里的山区行进中，共用了五十四分零一秒。获得男子第一名的是北京工业学院的李志广，他在四十八公里的行进中，用了六十五分二十一秒。
    中国人民国防体育协会李达主任到场参观了比赛。
