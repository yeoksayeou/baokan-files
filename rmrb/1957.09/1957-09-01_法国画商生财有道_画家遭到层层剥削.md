French art dealers control the "art market." They own private art galleries and collections of ancient and modern masterpieces and wield immense power in the art world. They can arbitrarily evaluate a painting and monopolize the selection of painters and works for international exhibitions. According to contracts with private galleries, a renowned painter receives a monthly living allowance from the dealer but must produce at least fifteen to thirty paintings, forcing them to work tirelessly even on Sundays. However, from this income, painters must deduct considerable professional expenses such as studio fees, paint costs, and various taxes. Therefore, even famous painters cannot maintain their families' minimum living standards solely through their artistic creations, forcing them to take on second jobs.

Typically, art dealers can earn hundreds of thousands of francs by selling a painting, many times more than the painter's monthly compensation. However, dealers do not want to sell all the paintings immediately. They treat paintings as stocks, speculating in the market to reap huge profits.

If a painter wants to achieve a certain status in the art world, they must hold an exhibition in a dealer's private gallery. In addition to paying rent ranging from 100,000 to 500,000 francs, the painter must also cover advertising costs. The dealer does not contribute a penny but takes 30% to 50% of the painter's total sales revenue. As a result, the fruits of the painter's year-long hard work are exploited by the art dealers.

    法国画商生财有道  画家遭到层层剥削
    本报讯  法国画商操纵了“绘画市场”，他们拥有私人绘画馆和古今名画，而且还掌握了绘画界大权。他们不仅能任意给一幅画评价，而且选派参加国际画展的画家和作品也由他们包办，按照私人绘画馆的契约一个有名望的画家从画商手里得到一个月的生活费，至少得画十五张到三十张画，这就迫得画家们星期日也得紧张工作。可是画家这一笔收入还要被扣除数目可观的职业性开支：如画室费、颜料费及其他各种苛捐杂税。因此即使是名画家单靠创作也不能维持一家大小的最低生活。为此他们不得不从事第二种职业。
    通常画商卖掉一幅画能得好几十万法郎。这比付给画家一个月的报酬多好多倍。但是画商们并不想马上把所有的画卖出去。他们把绘画当作股票，在市场上作投机买卖，以获暴利。
    如果画家要想在艺术界取得一定的地位，就必须在画商的私人绘画馆举办画展。画家除了缴纳十万到五十万法郎的房费外还要出广告费。画商不出一个钱，却要从画家全部卖画款项中扣取30％至50％。结果画家终年辛苦的劳动成果，都被画商们剥削去了。
