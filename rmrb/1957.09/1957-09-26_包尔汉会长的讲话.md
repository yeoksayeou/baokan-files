Chairman Burhan's Speech

Esteemed Dr. Mohammad Hatta, distinguished guests from Indonesia, ladies, gentlemen, comrades:

Today, the Chinese-Indonesian Friendship Association is holding a grand gathering here to welcome former Vice President of the Republic of Indonesia, Dr. Mohammad Hatta, and his wife on their friendly visit to our country. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese-Indonesian Friendship Association, to extend a warm welcome and heartfelt respect to our distinguished guests.

Dr. Hatta is a renowned Indonesian national independence fighter, political activist, and scholar. The Chinese people greatly admire Dr. Hatta's contributions to the struggle for national independence and national construction, as well as his academic achievements and reputation.

Indonesia is a great country with over eighty million hardworking and intelligent people and a long-standing culture. Since gaining independence, Indonesia has pursued an independent and autonomous foreign policy, playing an increasingly important role in the struggle against colonialism and in defense of world peace. Indonesia was one of the initiators and hosts of the historically significant Asian-African Conference. After the Asian-African Conference, Indonesia made tremendous efforts to implement the conference's resolutions and promote the "Bandung Spirit." Recently, the Indonesian people, along with peace-loving people all over the world, have actively supported the just struggle of the people in the Middle East and Africa to win and safeguard national independence and state sovereignty. The Chinese people feel very honored to have such a great neighbor as Indonesia.

The friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people has a history of more than two thousand years. As early as the second century BC, the people of our two countries had mutual exchanges and began cultural and trade contacts. Later, a large number of Chinese people continued to migrate to various parts of Indonesia. They established brotherly relations with the Indonesian people. This has made the Chinese people have a deeper feeling for Indonesia. Since the people of our two countries freed themselves from the shackles of colonialism and established new countries, our friendship has been continuously consolidated and developed on a new basis. In recent years, our two countries have sent various delegations to each other and have respectively established the China-Indonesia Friendship Association and the Indonesia-China Friendship Association. Economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries is also developing rapidly. The Chinese people will unremittingly strive to further promote the friendship between the two peoples.

Esteemed Dr. Hatta: Please convey our friendship and respect for the Indonesian people to all the people of Indonesia.

Finally, I wish Indonesia national prosperity and the people happiness.

Long live the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people!

Long live world peace!

    包尔汉会长的讲话尊敬的穆罕默德·哈达博士阁下，印度尼西亚贵宾们，女士们，先生们，同志们：
    今天，中国印度尼西亚友好协会在这里举行盛大的集会，欢迎前印度尼西亚共和国副总统穆罕默德·哈达博士和夫人前来我国进行友好访问。请允许我代表中国印度尼西亚友好协会向贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的敬意。
    哈达博士是印度尼西亚著名的民族独立战士、政治活动家和学者。中国人民十分钦佩哈达博士对于争取祖国独立和国家建设所作的贡献以及他在学术方面所获得的成就和声誉。
    印度尼西亚是一个有八千多万勤劳智慧的人民和文化悠久的伟大国家。印度尼西亚在获得独立后，执行着独立自主的外交政策，在反对殖民主义、保卫世界和平的斗争中发挥着日益重大的作用。印度尼西亚是具有伟大历史意义的亚非会议的发起者之一和东道主。亚非会议后，印度尼西亚又为贯彻会议的决议、发扬“万隆精神”作出了巨大的努力。最近以来，印度尼西亚人民，和全世界爱好和平的人民一道，积极支持中东和非洲地区的人民争取和维护民族独立和国家主权的正义斗争。中国人民为有印度尼西亚这样伟大的邻邦，而感到十分光荣。
    中国和印度尼西亚两国人民之间的友谊有着两千多年的历史。早在公元前二世纪，两国人民就有了互相来往并且开始了文化和贸易上的联系。以后有数目众多的中国人民不断地移居印度尼西亚各地。他们同印度尼西亚人民建立了兄弟般的关系。这使得中国人民对印度尼西亚怀有更加深厚的感情。自从我们两国人民摆脱了殖民主义的枷锁并且各自建立了新的国家以后，我们之间的友谊，在新的基础上正不断地巩固和发展。这几年来，我们两国之间曾经互相派遣了各种代表团，并且分别成立了中国印度尼西亚友好协会和印度尼西亚中国友好协会。两国经济和文化的合作也在日益发展。中国人民将坚持不懈地为进一步促进两国人民的友谊而努力。
    尊敬的哈达博士：请将我们对印度尼西亚人民的友谊和敬意转达给印度尼西亚全国人民。
    最后，我谨祝印度尼西亚国家繁荣，人民幸福。
    中国和印度尼西亚两国人民的永恒友谊万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
