Xinhua News Agency report: Aimed at comprehensively transforming the natural landscape of the Yanbei area of Shanxi Province, agricultural capital construction has begun ahead of schedule in some areas of Zuoyun, Yanggao, Shuoxian, and other counties that have finished harvesting autumn crops. It is estimated that by early October, more than 400,000 people in the Yanbei area will participate in this movement.

This agricultural capital construction focuses on four major projects: soil and water conservation, water conservancy construction, afforestation, and the development of mountain transportation, combined with measures to improve the farming system and increase production. It will be carried out under the principle of unified planning and comprehensive management. The successful experience of soil and water conservation at Daquanshan in Yanggao County will be promoted throughout the region, and Yanbei is required to produce 500 "Daquanshans" this year.

The relevant leading departments in the Yanbei area recently held a special meeting to summarize last year's experiences, review this year's project plans and preparations, and plan to establish a dedicated leadership organization, transferring two to three hundred cadres for in-depth guidance. Counties will also take a series of measures to strengthen leadership.

The Yanbei area is mostly mountainous and hilly plateau. In the past, due to lack of tree and grass cover and extensive farming, there was high wind and sand, which made fertile land barren. It was a historically famous desolate area. Since liberation, the Yanbei area has begun to manage the land, and the natural landscape has gradually changed. After this year's agricultural capital construction plan is completed, even greater changes will occur in the Yanbei area.

    全面改造山区自然面貌
    雁北提前开始农业基本建设
    据新华社讯　以全面改造山西雁北地区自然面貌为主要目标的农业基本建设，已经在左云、阳高、朔县等县一部分收完秋季作物的地区提前开始。预计到10月初，雁北地区将有四十多万人参加这个运动。
    这次农业基本建设，以水土保持、水利建设、植树造林和发展山区交通事业四项工程为主，结合改良耕作制度等增产措施，在统一规划综合治理的方针下进行。阳高县大泉山的水土保持成功经验，将在全区推广，今年雁北全区要求出现五百个“大泉山”。
    雁北地区有关领导部门最近曾经召开专门会议，总结去年的经验，检查今年工程计划和准备工作，并且计划建立专门领导机构，抽调二百到三百个干部深入指导。各县也将采取一系列措施，加强领导。
    雁北地区绝大部分是山地和丘陵高原，过去因为缺乏树草覆盖，又加耕作粗放，风大砂多，使良田变瘠薄，是历史上有名的荒凉地带。解放以来，雁北地区开始治理工作，自然面貌逐渐改变。今年的农业基本建设计划完成后，雁北地区将发生更大的变化。
