    "Commentary on Mao Zedong's Eighteen Poems" to be Published as a Separate Volume This Month

    After the publication of the eighteen classical poems written by Chairman Mao in the inaugural issue of "Poetry Journal," they were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of readers. Poets like Zang Kejia and poetry researchers such as Zhou Zhenfu have successively published general commentaries on these poems in publications such as "China Youth" and "Language Learning." Recently, China Youth Publishing House specially invited Comrade Zang Kejia to make a more detailed commentary on these eighteen poems, and Comrade Zhou Zhenfu to make annotations on the allusions in them, in order to prepare a separate volume. The book is entitled "Commentary on Mao Zedong's Eighteen Poems." It will be published in late September.
