Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 12th: The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States issued a statement to the press, condemning the government for the atrocities committed by racists in the southern states and calling on the broad masses of the people to demand that federal agencies take effective measures to protect the democratic rights of Black people.

The statement said that the majority of the public in our country advocates taking strict measures to end the cruel oppression, segregation and discrimination against Black people. Conscious people in the United States should not allow a situation where armed soldiers help beastly racists violate the rights of Black children on the streets of southern cities, while the White House and the Department of Justice play a double game, delaying, evading, and shifting responsibility.

All American people should take immediate action to demand that the government take decisive action against criminal and persecuting racist thugs. Let our people immediately voice their voices. The crimes in Arkansas require all true Americans to take resolute action to fight for the complete eradication of all oppression of Black people in our country.

    新华社12日讯  据塔斯社纽约12日讯：美国共产党全国委员会向报界发表声明，就南部各州种族主义者的暴行谴责政府，并且号召广大人民群众要求联邦机构采取有效措施，保护黑人的民主权利。
    声明中说，我国的大多数公众都主张采取严厉的措施，以便结束对黑人的残酷压迫和种族隔离及歧视。美国人民中的有觉悟的群众不应当允许有这种情况发生，即武装士兵帮助野兽般的种族主义者在南方城市的大街上侵犯黑人儿童，而白宫和司法部却玩弄两面派手法，拖延、逃避和互相推脱责任。
    全体美国人民立即行动起来，要求政府立刻对犯罪的和迫害黑人的种族主义暴徒采取坚决行动。让我国人民立即发出自己的呼声。阿肯色的罪行要求一切真正的美国人采取坚决行动，为彻底根除我国对黑人的一切压迫而斗争。
