    Strolling Through the Working People's Palace of Culture
    Mid-Autumn Festival Evening Party
    On the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Beijing Working People's Palace of Culture will hold a "Story and Recitation Meeting." Mr. Jin Shoushen is invited to tell everyone about the various legends and myths related to the Mid-Autumn Festival, and actors from the Radio Drama Troupe will be invited to recite folk tales.
    If you don't like listening to those ancient legends and would rather make a scientific examination of the moon, then you can come and listen to the science report: "Flying to the Moon," and you can also observe the moon with a telescope to see if there are really Chang'e and the Jade Rabbit in the moon.
    On the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival and on the evening of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Palace of Culture will also present Peking Opera performances such as "Yao Qi" starring Qiu Shengrong and "Looking at the River Pavilion" starring Zhang Junqiu, as well as music appreciation concerts, dances, movies, ball games and other activities. The tea room also prepares a variety of mooncakes, fruits, wine and dishes to welcome workers and their families to celebrate the festival here. (Ling)
    Rich and Colorful Garden Party
    Since the beginning of summer, the Beijing Working People's Palace of Culture has held many garden parties. Due to the different target audiences, the garden parties have various names, such as: Summer Cool Evening Party, Trade Union Activists Garden Party, Summer Teachers Garden Party...etc. The Palace of Culture held a total of fourteen such evening parties this summer, with more than 230,000 workers participating. These evening parties are very popular among the workers. Like the summer cool evening party, tickets are sold out two days in advance each time, and many people have to inquire about the next ticket sales time. The content of the evening parties is varied. Young men can come to dance, watch ball games, and watch movies; older workers can drink tea, listen to storytelling, drums, and Qinshu, and watch chess games; family members mostly love to watch shadow puppet shows, magic tricks, or listen to comic dialogues. As long as you buy a ticket, you can participate in various activities you like. On the 12th of this month, the Palace of Culture will also hold a staff garden party. (Ling)
    Amateur Radio Group
    The amateur radio group for workers held by the Beijing Working People's Palace of Culture is very active. Currently, the group members are actively installing five-tube radios. They will use the six highly sensitive and exquisitely decorated radios that are about to be assembled to welcome the first anniversary of the group's establishment.
    The 24 members of this group are all amateur radio enthusiasts from factories and enterprises. They love science and persist in learning. Under the enthusiastic guidance of the instructor, Mr. Chen Yongcun, an engineer from a factory, each group member has achieved certain results over the past year. Xu Bingquan, a typesetter at the Beijing Daily, did not understand the scientific principles of radio at first, but now he can independently install five-tube radios that meet general quality standards.
    These people who love science are brewing the group's activity plan for the next stage. They will conduct in-depth research on specialized issues in radio science and prepare to take remote control as the central content of their study. (Wei Zhongshi)
    Active Amateur Art Troupe
    The Beijing Workers' Amateur Art Troupe is a workers' amateur art activity organization under the leadership of the Beijing Working People's Palace of Culture. The art troupe has been established for four years and now has nine teams and one group, with more than 600 members. It is the largest workers' amateur art group in the city.
    The art troupe has played a positive role in inspiring workers' enthusiasm for labor, enlivening workers' cultural life, and promoting workers' amateur cultural and artistic activities. In May and June of this year, the art troupe used its limited spare time to perform 32 consolation performances for workers in various factories, mines, and enterprises, entertaining more than 74,000 viewers. During the Beijing Trade Union Activists' Activity Week, the art troupe held two garden evening parties, performing five Peking Opera, Ping Opera, song and dance, and Quyi performances in succession, attracting a large number of viewers and winning high praise.
    Now, each team (group) of the art troupe is working hard to rehearse new programs in preparation for the National Day and the fourth quarter performance tasks. This batch of opera programs includes Peking Opera "Presenting the Silk Robe", "Five Righteous Men", "Mother Yue Tattoos", Ping Opera "Beating the Heartless Man" as well as Quyi, song and dance, music and other programs, which can be performed publicly in late October.

    Battles in the Chess Room
    Recently, chess activities at the Beijing Working People's Palace of Culture have become increasingly active. In order to attract more chess enthusiasts, the Palace of Culture expanded the chess room and built a large mat shed in front of the chess room, which can accommodate hundreds of people to watch chess games.
    Every Saturday evening and Sunday afternoon, there are exciting Chinese chess performance matches, challenge matches, and Chinese chess lectures in the chess room. These activities are warmly welcomed by the masses, especially the "Passing Five Gates and Slaying Six Generals" Chinese chess challenge match. People are very enthusiastic about participating in the challenge. Each time there are hundreds of people watching the battle. Liu Wenzhe, who won the 1956 Beijing Spring Festival Chess Championship and the runner-up of the Eight Major Cities Youth Student Chess Competition, also came to challenge a few days ago. This young chess player is resourceful and brave, and his killing skills are powerful. He broke through four levels in a row. If he can defeat the challenger Xu Jialiang, he will win a prize. Because the opponents were evenly matched, a fierce battle unfolded: Liu Wenzhe moved first, using the method of firing the central cannon, driving the chariot along the river, and attacking from the opponent's left wing. Xu Jialiang first defended the central pawn with a screen horse, and then straightened the third-way pawn. Liu Wenzhe greedily ate Xu Jialiang's seventh-way horse, and fell into the trap of "abandoning the horse to trap the chariot," and was defeated by Xu Jialiang. The audience cheered and applauded.
    The 1957 Beijing Staff Chess Competition officially began on August 11 at the Palace of Culture. A total of 252 employees participated in the competition. The competition has now entered the third round of group round-robin matches.
    The 1957 Beijing Chess Championship began its preliminary round on August 18. A total of 76 people participated in the competition. After three weeks of battle, it has now entered the second round of the semi-finals. Starting from September 8, Beijing's chess masters will conduct semi-finals and finals in the Palace of Culture Chess Room.

    漫步劳动人民文化宫
    中秋晚会
    在中秋节前夕，北京市劳动人民文化宫将举行一次“故事、朗诵会”。请金受申先生向大家讲有关中秋节的各种传说和神话，还请广播剧团的演员朗诵民间故事。
    假如你不喜欢听那些古老的传说，而愿意对月亮作一番科学的考察的话，那么你可以来听听科学报告：“飞向月宫”，还可以用望远镜观测月球，看看月亮里到底有没有嫦娥仙子和玉兔。
    在中秋节前夕和中秋节的晚上，文化宫里还演出裘盛戎主演的“姚期”、张君秋主演的“望江亭”等京剧，还有音乐欣赏会、舞会、电影、球赛等活动。茶点部还准备了许多月饼、水果、酒菜，接待职工及家属来这里欢度佳节。（令）
    丰富多彩的游园会
    从入夏以来，北京市劳动人民文化宫举行了许多次游园晚会。由于对象不同，游园会有各种名称，如：夏季乘凉晚会、工会积极分子游园联欢晚会、暑期教工游园晚会……等。今夏文化宫共举办了十四次这样的晚会，参加的职工在二十三万人以上。这些晚会都深受职工的欢迎。像夏季乘凉晚会，每次票提前两天就售完了，不少人只好打听下次的售票时间。晚会的内容是多种多样的，年青的小伙子们可以来跳舞、看打球、看电影等；老工人可以喝着茶，听评书、大鼓和琴书，看象棋比赛；家属们则多爱看皮影戏、变戏法、或者听相声。只要你买了一张票，就可以参加自己所喜爱的各种活动。本月12日，文化宫还要举办一次职工游园晚会。（令）
    业余无线电小组
    北京市劳动人民文化宫举办的职工业余无线电小组非常活跃，目前组员们正在积极安装五灯收音机。他们将以即将装好的具有高度灵敏性的六部装璜精致的收音机，来迎接小组成立的一周年。
    这个小组的二十四名成员，都是来自工厂、企业职工中的无线电业余爱好者。他们热爱科学，坚持学习，一年来利用业余时间在辅导员、某厂工程师陈勇存的热心指导下，每个组员都获得了一定的成绩。北京日报排字工人徐炳泉，起初对无线电的科学原理不够了解，现在他已经能够自己独立安装合乎一般质量标准的五灯收音机了。
    这些热爱科学的人们，正在酝酿下一阶段小组的活动计划，他们将深入研究无线电科学中的专门问题，准备把远距离操纵作为学习的中心内容。（魏中时）
    活跃的业余艺术团
    北京市工人业余艺术团是在北京市劳动人民文化宫领导下的一个职工业余艺术活动组织。艺术团成立四年了，现在拥有九个队、一个组，六百多名团员。是全市规模最大的一个职工业余艺术团体。
    艺术团在鼓舞职工的劳动热情，活跃职工的文化生活和带动职工开展业余文艺活动方面，起了积极的作用。今年5、6月间，艺术团利用有限的业余时间，为各厂矿、企业职工做了三十二场慰问演出，招待观众达七万四千多人。在北京市工会积极分子活动周中，艺术团举办了两次游园晚会，先后演出了五场京剧、评剧、歌舞、曲艺等，吸引了大量观众，深得好评。
    现在艺术团各队（组）正在为迎接国庆节和第四季度的演出任务努力排练新节目。这批戏曲节目，包括京剧“赠绨袍”、“五人义” “岳母刺字”，评剧“棒打薄情郎”以及曲艺、歌舞、音乐等节目，10月下旬可以公开表演。（方）
    棋艺室里的战斗
    近来，北京市劳动人民文化宫的棋艺活动日益活跃。为了吸引更多的棋艺爱好者，文化宫扩大了棋艺室，并在棋艺室前面搭了一个大席篷，可供数百人观摩棋赛。
    每星期六的晚上和星期日的下午，棋艺室里都有精采的象棋表演赛与擂台赛，以及象棋讲座等。这些活动受到群众的热烈欢迎，特别是对“过五关斩六将”象棋擂台赛最感兴趣。前来打擂的人非常踊跃，每次观战的人都有数百人。曾荣获1956年北京市春节象棋赛冠军、八大城市青年学生象棋赛亚军刘文喆前几天也来打擂，这位青年棋手，机智勇猛，杀法厉害，一连破了四关，他如能战胜擂主徐家亮，即可得奖。因为棋逢对手，展开了一场激战：刘文喆先走，采用当头炮炮巡河走车过河的杀法由对方左翼杀入，徐家亮先以屏风马守住中卒，然后直挺三路卒子。刘文喆贪吃徐家亮的七路马，竟中了“弃马陷车”的圈套，为徐家亮挫败。观众齐声叫好，掌声四起。
    1957年度北京市职工象棋赛已于8月11日在文化宫正式开始。参加比赛的职工共二百五十二人。目前比赛已进入第三轮分组循环赛。
    1957年北京市象棋冠军赛自8月18日开始了初赛。参加比赛的共有七十六人。经过三个星期的大战，目前已进入第二轮复赛。9月8日起，北京的象棋名手们，将在文化宫棋艺室进行复赛与决赛。
