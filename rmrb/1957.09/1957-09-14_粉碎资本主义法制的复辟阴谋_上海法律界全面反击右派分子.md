　　Smash the Conspiracy of Rightists to Restore Capitalist Rule of Law
　　Shanghai Legal Circles Fully Counterattack Rightist Elements
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 13th: A Xinhua News Agency reporter summarized the situation of the anti-Rightist struggle in Shanghai's legal circles over the past three months, saying: The anti-Rightist struggle in Shanghai's legal circles has been fully launched in all aspects over the past three months. The conspiracy of many rightist elements to seize the "knife handle" of the people's democratic dictatorship and restore capitalist rule of law has been exposed. At present, some rightist elements have begun to lower their heads and confess their guilt; some are trying to muddle through; and some are still stubbornly resisting, but they have become alienated and isolated.
    According to the materials that have been revealed, the rightist elements in Shanghai's legal circles include: Wang Zaoshi, a professor at Fudan University who wears the mask of a "gentleman" and has always been anti-Communist and anti-socialist; Yang Zhaolong, a former prosecutor of the Kuomintang government's procuratorate and professor at Fudan University; Luo Jiaheng, who wrote reactionary books to pay tribute to the pseudo-National Assembly; Zhang Mengwen, a professor at Fudan University; the rightist small group headed by He Jixiang, a member of the China Democratic League, including Liu Heping, Zhang Zhong, Long Zhenzhong, Li Guoji and others; and Yan Wenxiong, a judge of the Putuo District People's Court. This group of rightist elements, with Wang Zaoshi as the "commander" and Yang Zhaolong as the "vanguard," launched a series of vicious attacks on the Communist Party from the aspects of legal theory, national legal system, political and legal education, judicial reform, and anti-espionage and civil and criminal cases. As early as the end of 1956, Yang Zhaolong published "The Class Nature and Inheritance of Law," firing the first poisonous arrow at Marxist-Leninist jurisprudence. This rightist "vanguard" proposed that law has no class nature, and there is no difference between the laws of capitalist countries, fascist countries, and socialist countries. In June of this year, Yang Zhaolong again published "Why Has Our Country's Important Code of Laws Not Been Promulgated for So Long," slandering that there is no law in our country at present. At the same time, Wang Zaoshi falsely claimed that after liberation, "there is only rule by people and no rule of law," and now it is "there is no law to rely on, laws are not followed, and laws and discipline are violated." Wang Zaoshi, Yang Zhaolong and others also falsely claimed that the law departments of current universities are run in a "terrible mess," attempting to restore bourgeois sociology, political science and other courses. At this time, the rightist element He Jixiang's small group working in the court colluded with Wang Zaoshi and Yang Zhaolong from within and without. Under the planning of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League's rightist group, they vigorously recruited troops and bought horses in the judicial department, established the China Democratic League's judicial work group, and collected and fabricated "materials" of wrongly judged cases for Wang Zaoshi and Yang Zhaolong as cannonballs to attack the Communist Party. Zhang Mengwen also echoed Luo Longji, attempting to organize a "Committee for Reversing Unjust Verdicts." These rightist elements also colluded with Lu Yi and Chen Weisi, rightist elements of the Xinwen Daily. Xinwen Daily convened a forum of old judicial personnel and professors they had selected to further attack our country's legal system, slander worker-peasant judges, incite counter-revolutionary criminals to overturn verdicts, and incite old judicial personnel to "return to the team," attempting to create a vast momentum for a full-scale attack on the socialist judicial front. This was to achieve the goal of forcing the Communist Party to withdraw from the court, shaking the pillar of the people's democratic dictatorship, and usurping the state's judicial power.
    Since the start of the anti-Rightist struggle on Shanghai's legal front, hundreds of meetings, large and small, have been held. Those who attended used a large number of facts to reason with the rightist elements and launched a debate. Worker-peasant-born judges and jurors used their achievements in handling cases to counter the slander of the rightist elements. Personnel who had worked in the old judicial circles also used their personal experiences to explain that the old judicial personnel must be reformed. Many law professors used ample theory to focus on criticizing the reactionary arguments such as "law has no class nature" and "old law can be inherited." During the great debate, many people also exposed the ugly history of these rightist elements, and also revealed that many of these people who professed to support the rule of law were people who did not abide by the law.
    Now, the broad masses of people in Shanghai's legal circles are preparing to further launch a great debate from all aspects on the basis of the previous stage of the struggle with high morale, focusing on criticizing the old legal viewpoints, and thoroughly exposing the conspiracy of the rightist elements to usurp judicial power.

　　粉碎资本主义法制的复辟阴谋
　　上海法律界全面反击右派分子
    据新华社上海13日电  新华社记者综述三个月来上海法律界反右派斗争的情况说：上海法律界的反右派斗争，三个月来已经在各个方面全面展开。许多右派分子妄图夺取人民民主专政的“刀把子”，使资本主义法制复辟的阴谋已经被揭露出来。目前有的右派分子已经开始低头认罪；有的企图蒙混过关；有的仍在死命顽抗，但他们已经众叛亲离，孤立无援。
    根据已经揭露的材料，上海法律界的右派分子有：披着“君子”外衣、一贯反共反社会主义的复旦大学教授王造时，曾任国民党政府检察署检察长、复旦大学教授杨兆龙，曾写过反动书籍向伪国大献礼的罗家衡，复旦大学教授张孟文，以民盟盟员何济翔为首的包括刘和平、张中、龙镇中、李国籍等人的右派小集团和普陀区人民法院审判员严文雄。这批右派分子以王造时为“主帅”，以杨兆龙为“先锋”，他们从法学理论、国家法制、政法教育、司法改革以及肃反和民事、刑事案件等方面，向共产党展开了一系列的恶毒进攻。杨兆龙在1956年年底就发表“法律的阶级性和继承性”，向马克思列宁主义法学放出第一支毒箭。这个右派“先锋”提出，法律没有阶级性，资本主义国家、法西斯国家的法律和社会主义国家的法律没有区别。在今年6月，杨兆龙又发表“我国重要法典何以迟迟还不颁布”，诬蔑我国目前没有法律。同时，王造时诬说解放后“只有人治而无法治”，现在是“无法可依，有法不依，违法乱纪”。王造时、杨兆龙等还诬蔑目前高等学校法律系办得“一团糟”，企图恢复资产阶级的社会学、政治学等课程。这时，法院工作的右派分子何济翔小集团同王造时、杨兆龙“内应外合”，在民盟上海市委右派集团的策划下，在司法部门大肆招兵买马，成立了民盟司法工作组，为王造时、杨兆龙收集和捏造错判案件的“材料”，作为向共产党进攻的炮弹。张孟文也同罗隆基呼应，企图组织“平反冤狱委员会”。这些右派分子并同新闻日报的右派分子陆诒、陈伟斯勾结，由新闻日报召集一批他们物色的旧司法人员和教授举行座谈会，进一步攻击我国法制，诬蔑工农审判人员，煽动反革命罪犯翻案，煽动旧司法人员“归队”，企图造成向社会主义司法阵地进行全面进攻的浩大声势。由此达到要共产党退出法院，动摇人民民主专政的支柱，篡夺国家司法大权的目的。
    上海法律战线上的反右派斗争开始以后，曾召开了大小数百次会议。到会的人都以大量的事实，据理同右派分子展开了辩论。工农出身的审判员、陪审员们，以自己办案中的成绩回击了右派分子的诬蔑。曾在旧司法界工作过的人员，也以亲身的体会，说明旧司法人员必须进行改造。许多法律系教授以充足的理论，集中地批判了“法律没有阶级性”、“旧法可以继承”等反动论点。在大辩论中，许多人还揭露了这些右派分子的丑恶历史，并且揭露这批口口声声拥护法制的人有不少是不守法的人。
    现在上海法律界广大人士正以高昂的斗志，准备在前一阶段斗争的基础上，进一步从各个方面展开大辩论，集中地批判旧法观点，彻底揭露右派分子篡夺司法权的阴谋。
