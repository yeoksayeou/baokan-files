Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 2nd: United States officials said on August 31 that a Thor intermediate-range ballistic missile launched from Patrick Air Force Base in Florida on August 30 had again failed, its range far short of its intended target. This is the third consecutive test of this type of missile by the United States recently, and each one has failed.

The report said that the Thor missile began to turn as soon as it rose into the air, looking as if it was going to turn in a big circle and possibly return to the mainland. However, the missile did not fly back because it was destroyed at sea.

Prior to this, the first Thor missile was destroyed on the launch pad, and the second exploded in the air due to a malfunction.

    美试验中程导弹连续失败
    新华社2日讯  华盛顿消息：美国官员8月31日说，8月30日从佛罗里达州巴特里克空军基地发射的一枚雷神式中程弹道导弹又失败了，它的射程远没有达到原定的目标。这是美国最近一个时期内连续第三次试验这种导弹，一次接着一次都失败了。
    消息说，在雷神式导弹刚腾入空中以后，就开始转弯，看样子像要转一个大圈可能会回到大陆上来。不过，这枚导弹并没有飞回来，因为它在海上就炸毁了。
    在这以前，第一枚雷神式导弹是在发射台上就炸毁的，第二枚在射入空中后因装置失灵而爆炸了。
