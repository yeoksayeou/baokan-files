Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 25th: The Cairo newspaper "Al Messa" reported on September 24th that US Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Whitney, recently explained to the Macmillan government the US plan to use Syria's neighboring countries to overthrow the current Syrian government.

The "Al Messa" special correspondent reported that the US Ambassador said on September 1st that the US plan was to begin by sabotaging the oil pipelines passing through Syrian territory, or by creating incidents in the border areas of Iraq and Jordan, in order to use them as an excuse for Jordan, Iraq, Israel, and Turkey to attack Syria, and as an excuse for the US to send troops if necessary.

He said that the US government believes that it is currently impossible to organize a new coup in Syria, but its goals can be achieved by increasing pressure on Syria to the point of armed intervention.

Whitney told the British government that, despite the hesitant attitudes of the Iraqi and Jordanian governments, the US government is still insisting on implementing its plan to use Turkey and Israel to organize sabotage activities and create border incidents within Syria. At the same time, the US will increase economic aid to Turkey, support Turkey on the Cyprus issue, and support the realization of Turkey's demands for the Aleppo region of Syria.

The US government has assured Israel that it will lend it a large number of heavy weapons, internationalize the Gulf of Aqaba, and resolve the Palestine issue according to Israel's conditions.

The US plan also stipulates that, at the beginning of military intervention, traitors in Syria will form a so-called "Syrian government in exile," which will request assistance from the US in accordance with the "Eisenhower Doctrine." In addition, Syrian expatriates in Turkey will be mobilized to the Syrian border area.

    埃报揭露美国侵叙计划利
    用土耳其和以色列做马前卒
    据新华社开罗25日电　开罗“晚报”9月24日报道，美国驻英国大使惠特尼最近向麦克米伦政府说明了美国打算利用叙利亚的各邻国推翻叙利亚现政府的计划。
    “晚报”特派记者报道，美国大使曾经在9月1日说，美国的计划是要着手破坏穿过叙利亚领土的输油管或者在伊拉克和约旦的边境一带制造事件，以便用来作为约旦、伊拉克、以色列和土耳其进攻叙利亚的借口，和作为必要时由美国派军队前去的借口。
    他说，美国政府认为，目前要在叙利亚组织新政变是办不到的，但是可以通过把对叙利亚的压力增加到武装干涉的程度的作法来实现它的目标。
    惠特尼告诉英国政府说，尽管伊拉克和约旦两国政府态度犹豫不定，美国政府还是坚持实行它的计划，即利用土耳其和以色列在叙利亚国内组织破坏活动和制造边境事件。同时美国将增加对土耳其的经济援助，并且将在塞浦路斯问题上支持土耳其，以及支持土耳其对于叙利亚阿勒颇地区的要求得到实现。
    美国政府已经向以色列保证借给它大量重武器，把亚喀巴湾国际化，和根据以色列的条件来解决巴勒斯坦问题。
    美国的计划还规定，在军事干涉开始时，将由叙利亚的卖国贼组成所谓“叙利亚流亡政府”，它将根据“艾森豪威尔主义”要求美国给予援助。除此以外，还将动员在土耳其的叙利亚侨民到叙利亚边境一带去。
