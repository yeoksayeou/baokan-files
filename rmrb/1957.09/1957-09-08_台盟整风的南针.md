The Compass for the Rectification Campaign of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League
Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Vice Chairman Li Chunqing

At a crucial historical juncture, at an important moment in the democratic parties' rectification campaign, on August 29th, the People's Daily published an editorial entitled "The Serious Task of All Democratic Parties." We believe that this editorial embodies the Communist Party's leadership over the democratic parties, including theoretical and political enlightenment, and is also the Communist Party's specific assistance to the democratic parties' rectification campaign. With this editorial, the democratic parties have a mirror to examine themselves, a sharp weapon to thoroughly criticize the rightists, and also a direction for transformation and progress. On behalf of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, I fully agree with and support all the arguments in this editorial. We will take this editorial as the compass for the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League's rectification campaign and put it into practice.

We believe that the situation described in this editorial basically corresponds to the reality of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League. As a democratic party, the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League has made serious errors in its political and organizational lines. There are also right-wing elements within the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League. Generally speaking, the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League also needs to carry out a fundamental self-transformation, that is, an essential transformation.

During the period of airing views, Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League members did not express many anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks. However, during the symposiums held during this period, and before and after this period, some remarks were shockingly absurd. We are not trying to settle historical accounts, nor are we simply relying on a few accidentally misspoken words, but rather, based on the six political criteria put forward by Chairman Mao, and from the current facts and consistent words and deeds, we can prove that some members of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League still adhere to a capitalist stance. Of course, such people are in the minority. It is worth noting that this minority still has a market, confusing some people, thus creating chaos in the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League and obscuring right and wrong. In politics, the specific manifestation is to insist on opposing the Party's policies and guidelines for the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, opposing the Party's leadership over the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, and opposing socialism. Right-wing elements and right-wing ideology seriously hinder the transformation and progress of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League. Within the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, there has long been a struggle between two lines: socialism and capitalism. The question of who wins and who loses in this struggle has not been thoroughly resolved.

The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League has also had a right-wing organizational line. From the beginning, the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League engaged in large-scale recruitment, and some anti-communist elements and bad elements were also absorbed and allowed to hold real power in leadership positions in some places, so that the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League organizations there served the illegal capitalists of bad elements. The right-wingers of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League also adopted various methods to win over, deceive, and incite the middle elements, and to exclude and attack the leftists. This organizational line has been stopped and corrected. The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League has used great efforts to rectify the organization, and has not developed new members in recent years. However, the right-wing organizational line is still constantly active, always opposing the correct organizational line overtly or covertly, and using various excuses to try to create a situation in which the right-wing organizational line must be restored in order to create the "mass base" they need.

The right-wing elements of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League are also playing the "double-dealing" trick, verbally supporting the Party, but actually opposing the Party's leadership over the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League; verbally saying that they are taking the socialist road, but actually opposing socialist transformation and obliterating the achievements of socialist construction. They particularly oppose the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the elimination of counter-revolutionaries, and ideological remolding, and repeatedly demand rehabilitation and reversals of verdicts.

Based on the above facts, we have decided that the first step in the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League's rectification campaign is the anti-rightist struggle, and after a complete victory is achieved in the anti-rightist struggle, we will then move on to the general rectification. The standard for the rectification campaign is the six political criteria put forward by Chairman Mao. We firmly oppose all right-wingers. We absolutely cannot allow the right-wing elements of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League to lead the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League astray. I call on the members of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League to stand up, tear off the veil of false politeness, and bravely plunge into the anti-rightist struggle. This struggle must be carried out to the end, thoroughly defeating the right-wingers, clarifying right and wrong, "destroying the capitalist stance and establishing the socialist stance." Only in this way can the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League be fundamentally transformed. Only by transforming the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League into a political force that truly serves socialism can it gain the trust of the people, and only then will it not fail the expectations of the nine million Taiwan compatriots.

We firmly believe that the majority of the members will be able to withstand the test and will be able to pass the socialist test well. With a serious task before us, let us follow the compass proposed by the People's Daily editorial and resolutely move forward!

### 台盟整风的南针

    台盟整风的南针
    台湾民主自治同盟副主席　李纯青
    在重大的历史关头，在民主党派整风的重要时刻，8月29日，人民日报发表了题为“各民主党派的严重任务”的社论。我们认为，这篇社论体现了共产党对各民主党派的领导，包括理论和政治的启示，也是共产党对各民主党派整风的具体帮助。有了这篇社论，民主党派就有了照明自己的镜子，彻底批判右派的犀利的武器，同时也有了改造前进的方向了。我代表台盟完全同意和拥护这篇社论的全部论点。我们将把这篇社论作为台盟整风的南针，付之实践。
    我们认为这篇社论所写的情况，基本上也符合于台盟的实际。台盟作为一个民主党派，在政治路线和组织路线上都有过严重的错误。台盟盟内也有右派分子。总的说来，台盟也必要进行根本的自我改造，即本质改造。
    在鸣放期间，台盟成员发表反党反社会主义的言论不算很多。但在这期间举行的座谈会，以及在这段期间的前前后后，有一些言论也荒谬到可惊的程度。我们不是要清算历史问题，也不是单凭偶然说错了的几句话，而是根据毛主席提出的六条政治标准，从现在的事实和一贯的言行来看，证明在台盟成员中，仍然有人坚持资本主义的立场。当然这种人是少数。值得注意的是，这少数人仍有市场，迷惑了一部分人，因而把台盟造成混乱，使大是大非不明。在政治上，具体表现是坚持反对党对台盟的政策方针，反对党对台盟的领导，反对社会主义。右派分子和右派思想严重地妨碍台盟的改造和进步。在台盟内部，长期以来就存在着社会主义和资本主义两条路线的斗争。这个斗争谁胜谁负并没有彻底解决。
    台盟也存在过右派的组织路线。台盟一开始就是大事招兵买马，有些反共分子和坏分子也被吸收进来，并让他们在一些地方掌握领导的实权，使那里的台盟组织为坏分子不法资本家服务。台盟的右派也是采取各种办法来笼络、蒙蔽、煽惑中间派，排斥、打击左派。这条组织路线曾经被制止和纠正。台盟用过很大力量去整理组织，最近几年也没有发展盟员。但是右派的组织路线仍然不断在活跃，总是或明或暗地同正确的组织路线相对抗，并且用各种借口企图制造一种形势，非要恢复右派的组织路线不可，以便造成他们所需要的“群众基础”。
    台盟的右派分子也玩弄着“两面手法”，嘴里拥护党，实际是反对党对台盟的领导；嘴里说走社会主义的道路，实际是反对社会主义改造，抹煞社会主义建设的成绩。他们特别反对镇反、肃反和思想改造，一再要平反，要翻案。
    根据以上事实，我们决定台盟整风首先是反右派斗争，在反右派斗争取得全胜以后，再转入一般整风。整风的标准是毛主席提出的六条政治标准。我们坚决反对一切右派。绝对不能容许台盟的右派分子把台盟带上歧途。我号召台盟盟员站起来，撕破情面，勇敢地投入反右派斗争。必须把这场斗争进行到底，彻底打垮右派，弄清大是大非，“破资本主义立场，立社会主义立场”。只有这样，台盟才能得到根本的改造。要把台盟改造为真正为社会主义服务的政治力量，它才能获得人民的信任，也才不辜负九百万台湾同胞的期望。
    我们坚决相信盟员的多数，一定能够经得起考验，一定能够过好社会主义这一关。严重的任务摆在前面，让我们遵照人民日报社论所提出的南针，坚决地前进吧。
