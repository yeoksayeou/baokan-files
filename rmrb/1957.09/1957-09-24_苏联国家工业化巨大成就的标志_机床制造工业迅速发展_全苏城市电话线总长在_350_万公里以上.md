    Signs of the Great Achievements of Soviet National Industrialization
    Rapid Development of Machine Tool Manufacturing Industry
    Total Length of Urban Telephone Lines in the Soviet Union Exceeds 3.5 Million Kilometers

    (Dispatch from our Moscow correspondent on September 23) The Soviet machine tool manufacturing industry has developed rapidly. In 1956, the production of various automated, semi-automated, and high-speed cutting machine tools reached 121,300 units, an increase of eighty times compared to 1913. The quantity and quality of Soviet machine tool production have far exceeded those of Britain and France and are second only to the United States, ranking second in the world.
    Soviet machine tool manufacturing became an independent production system, starting during the Soviet First Five-Year Plan. In 1913, Russia had only four factories capable of producing machine tools, producing some of the most common lathes and turning machines. Now, the Soviet Union has 135 factories manufacturing machine tools, 46 of which are specialized machine tool factories. In 1932, the Soviet Union could only manufacture 40 types of machine tools; in 1957, it could manufacture 847 types, and by 1960, it will produce 1,200 types of various new machine tools. Soviet-produced machine tools can now cut tools of any size with high precision.
    The Soviet Union has also made great progress in producing various precision machine tools. For example, in 1940, it could only produce seven types of precision machine tools; now, it has developed to produce 120 types. Moreover, the quality of various machine tools has also significantly improved. For example, the "TH-20" new-style lathe manufactured by the "Red Proletarian" Machine Tool Factory in 1932 had a speed of 320 revolutions per minute. The "y-K-62" lathe produced by the same factory in 1957 has a speed of 2,000 revolutions per minute, and the "y-M-620" lathe has reached 3,000 revolutions per minute. By 1960, the Soviet Union will produce 20 million various machine tools, 40% of which will be automated and semi-automated.
    In recent years, the Soviet Union has paid special attention to the development of heavy-duty machine tool manufacturing. New heavy-duty machine tool factories have been built in Kalomna, Novosibirsk, Ryazan, and other places. Soviet machine tool production can now produce complete sets of well-equipped machine tools for automobile factories, tractor factories, and electrical appliance factories.
    The development of the Soviet machine tool manufacturing industry proves the great achievements of Soviet national industrialization.

    (Xinhua News Agency, September 23) A TASS dispatch introducing the Soviet postal and telecommunications事业 states that the total length of telephone lines between cities in the Soviet Union currently exceeds 3.5 million kilometers. Before World War I, there were only 87 telephone lines between cities in all of Russia, with a total length of just over 7,500 kilometers.
    Before the start of the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1956-1960), Moscow established round-the-clock telephone connections with 64 centers of Soviet republics, states, and frontier regions, linking Moscow with the Volga region, the Ural region, and Siberia. Currently, residents of cities thousands of kilometers away from the capital can talk to Moscow.
    Now, the number of users of urban and district telephone networks is in the millions, and many large cities have built huge automatic telephone exchanges.
    Before the October Revolution, it was rare for residents of remote Russian villages to receive letters. At that time, newspapers and letters were only delivered regularly in large cities, while mail to villages and towns was only delivered once or twice a week. Now, the number of post offices has greatly increased, tenfold compared to before the October Revolution, with 211,000 postal workers serving urban and rural residents. In 1956, nearly four billion letters were delivered, compared to just over 660 million forty years ago. The number of newspapers and magazines sent to residents annually has increased from 358 million in the past to 15 billion.
    Radio broadcasting has also been widely developed in the Soviet Union. Currently, Soviet radio stations broadcast in 80 languages of various Soviet nationalities and 34 foreign languages. Now, in terms of the broadcasting capacity of radio stations, the Soviet Union ranks first in Europe and second in the world. Before the beginning of this year, there were 29.5 million radio receiving points in the Soviet Union. Currently, there are 21 television centers nationwide, and the number of television centers will more than double by the end of the Sixth Five-Year Plan.

    苏联国家工业化巨大成就的标志
    机床制造工业迅速发展
    全苏城市电话线总长在350万公里以上
    本报莫斯科23日电　苏联机床制造工业迅速发展。1956年生产了各式自动化半自动化和高速切削的机床达十二万一千三百台，即比1913年增加八十倍。苏联机床生产的数量和质量已远远超过了英国、法国，仅次于美国，居世界第二位。
    苏联机床制造成为独立生产系统，是开始于苏联第一个五年计划期间。1913年俄国只有四个能生产机床的工厂，生产一些最普通的车床、旋床。现在苏联已有一百三十五个制造机床的工厂，其中四十六个是专业性的机床制造厂。1932年苏联只能制造四十种机床，1957年已能制造八百四十七种机床，到1960年将生产一千二百种各式新机床。苏联生产的机床已能够高度精确地切削任何尺寸的工具了。
    苏联生产各式精密机床也有了很大进步，如1940年只能生产七种精密机床，现在已发展到能生产一百二十种各式精密机床了，而且，各种机床质量也显著提高，例如，1932年“红色无产者”机床厂制造的“TH——二十”型新式旋床，每分钟速度为三百二十转。而这个厂在1957年生产的“y—K——六二型”旋床速度已达每分钟二千转，“y—M——六二○型”旋床已达三千转。到1960年全苏将生产二千万架各式机床，其中40％是自动化和半自动化的机床。
    最近几年来，苏联特别注意发展重型机床制造业。又在卡罗明、新西伯利亚、梁赞等地新建了重型机床厂。苏联的机床生产已能成套地生产供应汽车厂、拖拉机厂、电器厂等的设备完善的机床了。
    苏联机床制造业的发展，证明苏联国家工业化的巨大成就。
    新华社23日讯　塔斯社一则介绍苏联邮电事业的消息说，目前苏联城市间的电话线路总长度在三百五十万公里以上。而在第一次世界大战以前，全俄国城市间的电话线路只有八十七条，总长度只有七千五百多公里。
    第六个五年计划（1956—1960年）开始前，莫斯科同苏联各加盟共和国、州和边疆区的六十四个中心建立了昼夜电话联系，把莫斯科同伏尔加沿岸区域、乌拉尔区域和西伯利亚等地区联在一起。目前，离首都数千公里以外的城市的居民都可以同莫斯科通话。
    现在，城市和区电话网的用户数以百万计，许多大城市都建有巨大的自动电话站。
    十月革命前，俄国辽远村庄的居民能够收到信件就是件很稀罕的事，那时，仅仅在大城市才定期收到报纸和信件，而村镇的邮件每周只送一两次。现在，邮局的数量已经大大增加了，等于十月革命前的十倍，有二十一万一千个邮政人员为城乡居民服务。1956年递送的信件几乎达到四十亿封，而四十年前却只不过是六亿六千万封多一点。每年送给居民的报纸和杂志的份数已经从过去的三亿五千八百万份增加到一百五十亿份。
    无线电广播在苏联也获得了广泛的发展。目前苏联电台用八十种苏联各民族的语言和三十四种外国语言进行广播。现在，按广播电台的广播能力来说，苏联在欧洲占第一位，在世界占第二位。今年年初以前苏联境内的收音点有二千九百五十万个。目前，全国共有二十一个电视中心，而到第六个五年计划终了时，电视中心的数目还要增加两倍多。
