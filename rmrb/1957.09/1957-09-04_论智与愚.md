Local Newspaper's Anti-Rightist Commentary

"On Wisdom and Foolishness"

The Nanjing Xinhua Daily published an editorial entitled "On Wisdom and Foolishness" on August 31st.

The editorial said: Some rightists are clamoring about "the foolish stepping down" and "the wise taking office" (in some places, they are suggesting "the virtuous"); "the foolish get out" and "the wise come to power." They are uglifying all the Communist Party members who are wholeheartedly working for socialism, denouncing them as "fools," and wanting to sweep them out the door; while they are beautifying those rightists cloaked in the guise of experts and scholars, crowning them as "the wise," and wanting them to take the lead. These rightists obviously want to use these two words, wisdom and foolishness, as anti-communist ammunition and weapons.

The editorial said, however, their purpose will not be achieved. Because the issue of a person's wisdom or foolishness is first and foremost a matter of political stance and political direction, that is, the relationship between people and the laws of historical development. Revolution is wisdom, reaction is foolishness; this is the root of the matter. Whoever stands on the revolutionary stance, is completely in line with the laws of historical development, and thus can recognize objective truth and safeguard the interests of historical progress, is the wise one. Conversely, whoever stands on the reactionary stance, violates the direction of historical progress, and thus, blinded by self-interest, distorts objective truth and obstructs social progress, is the fool. By this standard, people can know that Communist Party members and worker-peasant cadres are not only not foolish, but are in fact highly intelligent. Because under the leadership of the Party, uniting the masses, they have fought for the democratic revolution and are still fighting for the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Their class stance is firm, their political direction is correct, and their actions are in line with the direction of historical progress; they are the truly wise people. Conversely, rightist key figures like Gao Juefu, who in the past stood on the reactionary stance and helped Chiang Kai-shek study the "morale, why is it not high" of soldiers, and now commit the crimes of opposing the Communist Party, opposing the people, and opposing socialism, still want to pull the wheels of history backward after China has completed the democratic revolution and basically completed the socialist revolution. Even if his knowledge is vast, it cannot change his fundamental reaction and foolishness.

The editorial wrote: Can a person abandon a certain class's position in a certain historical stage of development and engage in empty talk about their inherent wisdom or foolishness? Rightist elements are doing just that, engaging in empty talk about wisdom and foolishness, attempting to ignite the flames of anti-communism, which is fundamentally absurd and unreasonable.

The editorial said: The claim by some rightists that they possess scientific knowledge must also be analyzed specifically. There are two major categories of knowledge: one is the knowledge of the struggle for production—natural science; the other is the knowledge of the class struggle—social science. History has proven that progressive social science always belongs to the progressive class; the reactionary class cannot possess a genuine social science. Even natural science, in the final analysis, is determined by the needs of material production and the needs of the overall social development; a progressive worldview also has a significant impact on natural science. Therefore, it is always the progressive class that can represent the development of natural science. Thus, it is not the bourgeois rightists who are the intelligent people who master science, but rather the working class and the laboring people who are the huge force truly promoting the development of science. The workers and peasants are not only the creators of material wealth, but also the creators of spiritual culture; they are heroes of great wisdom and intelligence. Of course, we acknowledge that some rightists also possess certain knowledge of natural science, but they are very confused in the area of social science. For example, some rightists are full of reactionary feudalist, capitalist, and fascist thoughts. They say that "Marxism-Leninism is not as good as Buddhism," promote the "immortality of the soul" of "esoteric Buddhism," and clamor about "it is your wrong dialectics," etc.; they are the most foolish people in this regard. As for the natural science knowledge they possess, it is also limited in scope. What they know is only one or a few branches of science, and they are not, and cannot be, some kind of "omnipotent doctor." Today, the study of all aspects of the universe is as vast as the sea; it is simply not worth using one's own bit of scientific knowledge to look down on everything. Doing so is not a sign of intelligence. What's more, these bourgeois rightists, due to their reactionary stance, cannot represent the development requirements of natural science.

The editorial also said that everyone should also know that all knowledge comes from practice, and is not the result of scholars and experts thinking purely behind closed doors. Therefore, the workers, peasants, and their cadres, who are the "country bumpkins" that the rightists speak of, are not lacking in knowledge. On the contrary, they have gained rich knowledge in the practice of production struggle and class struggle. Of course, due to the limitations of historical conditions, many of them did not receive systematic education in the past and lacked some necessary professional knowledge, but this is not something that "cannot be drilled into," but something that can be learned. The editorial said that the issue of the laboring people mastering science and culture is not as mysterious as the rightists deliberately make it out to be. Rightist elements intentionally obliterate the potential of worker-peasant cadres to learn science and technology (such as having rich practical experience, having revolutionary perseverance and a spirit of diligent study, etc.), describe themselves as "naturally" intelligent, and describe worker-peasant cadres as "inferior races" who "cannot be drilled into." This is simply peddling the fascist theory of "racial superiority." It is very obvious that here, the rightist elements are also intentionally avoiding the question of the source of knowledge. They never mention the truth that science originates from productive practice and class struggle, but instead magnify their bit of book knowledge, look down on everything, and are hostile to the workers and peasants, fundamentally negating the significance of direct practical experience and negating the value of practical knowledge. This can only be a manifestation of their reactionary stance. It is not difficult for people to understand that if there were no thousands of years of planting and cultivation by farmers, could there be any agricultural science? Isn't the object of study for someone like Zhou Shiluo, who studies rice, the working experience of thousands upon thousands of farmers? Without the planting of farmers, from where could Zhou Shiluo process, organize, and elevate the science of rice? Thus, it can be seen that the rightist elements are opposing the people with their bit of knowledge and have forgotten that the source of knowledge is in the people. This is not only reactionary but also foolish. We also hope that many friends in the knowledge community can learn a lesson from this, correct the erroneous thinking of belittling practice, belittling labor, and belittling workers and peasants, and strive to transform themselves so that they truly become proletarian intellectuals who have a Marxist-Leninist worldview and are integrated with the workers and peasants. Only in this way can intellectuals become useful talents for our country.

The editorial concluded: In short, wisdom? Foolishness? Different class positions have different views. What the rightists call "foolish" is precisely what the people call "wise"; what the people call "foolish" is precisely what the rightists call "wise." Rightist elements attempt to use abstract concepts of wisdom and foolishness, to call wisdom foolish and foolishness wisdom, and to incite anti-communist sentiment. This conspiracy will not succeed. Everyone can see that some rightist elements are using this word "wisdom" to flatter some other bourgeois intellectuals, wanting them to come out and oppose the Communist Party; at the same time, these rightist elements are using this word "foolish" to uglify Communist Party members and worker-peasant cadres, wanting to drive them away in order to achieve the goal of negating the leadership of the entire Communist Party. This is the conspiracy behind their clamoring about "the foolish get out" and "the wise come to power." This conspiracy must be thoroughly exposed.

### “论智与愚”

1957-09-04

专栏：地方报上的反右派评论

    “论智与愚”
    南京新华日报8月31日发表了题为“论智与愚”的社论。
    社论说：有一些右派分子叫嚣什么“愚者退位”，“智者就任” （也有的地方是提“贤者”）；“愚者滚蛋”，“智者上台”。他们把忠心耿耿为社会主义工作的共产党员，统统加以丑化，骂为“愚者”，要将他们扫地出门；而把那些披着专家、学者外衣的右派分子，统统加以美化，封为“智者”，要使他们登台挂帅。这些右派分子显然想用这智愚二字，作为反共的弹药和凶器。
    社论说，但是，他们的目的是达不到的。因为一个人的智愚的问题，首先是政治立场、政治方向问题，也就是人们和历史发展规律的关系问题。革命是智，反动是愚，这是问题的根本。但凡一个人站在革命的立场上，和历史发展的规律完全一致，因而能够认清客观真理，维护历史前进的利益，这才是智者；反之，但凡一个人站在反动的立场上，违反历史前进的方向，因而利令智昏地歪曲客观真理，阻挠社会的进步，那就是愚人。以此言论，人们就可以知道，共产党员，工农干部非但不愚，而且是大智。因为他们在党的领导下，团结群众，曾经为民主主义革命而战，现在还在为社会主义革命和社会主义建设而战，他们的阶级立场是坚定的，他们的政治方向是正确的，他们的行动是符合历史前进的方向的，他们才是真正智慧的人。反之，右派骨干如高觉敷之流，过去曾经站在反动的立场上，帮蒋介石研究什么“士气，为何不振”的士兵心理，现在又干出反共、反人民、反社会主义的罪恶勾当，在中国已经完成了民主主义革命和基本上完成了社会主义革命以后，还想把历史车轮拉向后退，那就尽管他的知识很多，也不能改变他根本上的反动和愚蠢。
    社论中写道：难道一个人可以离开一定的阶级在一定的历史发展阶段中的地位，来空谈他们本身的什么智愚吗？右派分子正是这样来空谈智愚、妄图煽起反共的火焰，这是根本荒谬无理的。
    社论说：对于一部分右派分子吹嘘他们具有科学知识这件事本身，也要作具体分析。知识有两大类，一类是生产斗争的知识——自然科学；一类是阶级斗争的知识——社会科学。历史证明，进步的社会科学，总是属于进步阶级的，反动的阶级不可能具有真正作为科学的社会科学。就是自然科学，归根到底还是由物质生产的需要和整个社会发展的需要来决定的，进步的世界观对于自然科学也是有严重影响的，所以也总是进步的阶级才能代表自然科学的发展。由此可见，并不是资产阶级右派分子们才是掌握科学的聪明人，而倒是工人阶级和劳动人民才是真正促进科学发展的巨大力量。工农劳动人民不但是物质财富的创造者，也是精神文化的创造者，他们才是大智大慧的英雄。当然，我们承认，有些右派分子也具有一定的自然科学的知识，但是，他们在社会科学方面却是很糊涂的。比如有一些右派分子，满脑袋的封建主义、资本主义、法西斯主义的反动思想，他们说什么“马列主义不如佛学”，宣传什么“密宗”的 “灵魂不灭”，叫嚣什么“是你错的辩证法”等，他们在这方面就是最愚蠢的人。至于他们所具有的自然科学知识，那也是有一定范围的。他们所知道的，也不过是一种科学的某一个或某几个分支，并不是也不可能是什么“万能博士”。今天科学对于宇宙各方面的研究，广阔如海，根本不值得拿自己的一点点科学知识就来傲视一切。这样做，也不是什么聪明的事。更何况这些资产阶级右派，由于他们的反动立场，他们是并不能代表自然科学的发展要求的。
    社论又说，大家还应当知道，一切知识都来源于实践，而并不是学者专家闭门纯粹思考的结果。所以，工农劳动群众及其干部，即右派所说的“土包子”，并不缺乏知识，反之，他们在生产斗争和阶级斗争的实践中，倒是获得了丰富的知识。当然，他们由于历史条件的限制，过去的确有很多人没有受到系统的教育，缺少某些必要的专业知识，但是这并不是“钻也钻不进去”，而是可以学会的。社论说，劳动人民掌握科学文化的问题，并不如右派故意讲的那样神秘。右派分子有意抹杀工农干部学习科学技术的潜力（如具有较丰富的实践经验，具有革命的毅力和刻苦钻研的精神等等），把他们自己描写为“天生的”聪明，把工农干部描写为“劣等人种”，“钻也钻不进去”，这简直是在贩卖“人种优劣”的法西斯主义的论调。很显然，在这里，右派分子还有意回避知识的来源问题。绝口不谈科学产生于生产实践和阶级斗争的真理，而把他们一点书本知识扩大起来，目空一切，敌视工农劳动人民，根本否定直接的实践经验的意义，否定实际知识的价值，这只能是他们反动立场的表露。人们不难懂得，如果没有历史上千千万万农民的种植耕作，能有什么农业科学呢？像周拾禄那样研究水稻的人，研究的对象难道不是千千万万农民的劳作经验吗？离开了农民的种植，周拾禄从什么地方可以加工、整理、提升出水稻科学来呢？由此可见，右派分子拿着自己的一点知识，就来与人民对立，忘记了知识的源泉正是在人民当中，这就未免是既反动而又愚蠢。我们还希望知识界的许多朋友们，也能由此吸取教训，纠正那种轻视实践、轻视劳动、轻视工农的错误思想，努力改造自己，使自己真正成为具有马列主义世界观、同工农打成一片的无产阶级知识分子。只有这样，知识分子才能成为我们国家的有用之才。
    社论最后说，总之，智乎？愚乎？阶级立场不同，看法各异，右派谓之“愚”，正是人民谓之“智”，人民谓之“愚”，正是右派谓之“智”，右派分子妄图利用抽象的智愚概念，指智为愚，指愚为智，煽起反共情绪，这种阴谋是不能得逞的。大家都可以看出：一些右派分子正是利用这一个“智”字，拍另一些资产阶级知识分子的马屁，想叫他们出来反共；同时，这些右派分子又利用这一个“愚”字，丑化共产党员、工农干部，要赶走他们，以达到否定整个共产党领导的目的。这就是他们叫嚣什么“愚者滚蛋”、“智者上台”的阴谋。这种阴谋是必须彻底揭穿的。
