    They Love Their Hometown's Agricultural Cooperative
    Yu Feng
      "Last year after joining the cooperative, I didn't participate in production. My two sons are workers, and the money they sent back was enough to support me. But I was most afraid of my eldest daughter-in-law, who is the production team leader, and always wanted to assign me work. I would agree verbally, then sneak out the back door to wander around, either going to the street to drink tea or gossiping in small shops.

      "This year, it's different. My two sons came back on vacation and both urged me to participate in production. They said I'm only in my forties or fifties, and in good health, so how can I not work? I thought they were right. It's not right for me not to work when I'm able to. This year I participated in labor. I was contracted to make all the straw ropes for plowing and carrying for the whole team, and I was also responsible for tasks like rice seed germination with two other old farmers!"

    This is what Hong Daokun, a member of the 22nd team of the Xingguang Agricultural Cooperative in Feidong County, Anhui Province, said.

    The 22nd team has a total of 67 households, of which 36 have members working in factories in Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhu, and other places. These workers are very concerned about the agricultural cooperative. When they return home for vacation, they always take the initiative to talk with the cooperative and team cadres and members to understand the situation of the cooperative. Last Spring Festival, knowing that there were few cultural and recreational activities in the countryside, they sent 100 yuan back to the cooperative as funds for building a club after returning to the factory, and later sent two to three hundred books and recreational and sports supplies. This Spring Festival, the workers returned home and saw that the members and cadres were in low spirits due to the reduced production caused by last year's disaster, so they took the initiative to hold a worker-peasant symposium. At the meeting, the workers inquired in detail about the cooperative's situation last year and analyzed the existing problems with the cooperative cadres. Finally, they encouraged the agricultural cooperative cadres, saying, "There will always be some twists and turns in the first year of running a cooperative, but you must not be intimidated by difficulties." Finally, they expressed that they would support the cooperative in striving for a bumper harvest this year, and would often contact the cooperative to understand the situation and provide timely assistance if there were difficulties. They also immediately took out 60 yuan as the team's production funds.

    The workers also actively mobilized their families to participate in production and save money to invest in the team. Last year, out of the 36 worker households, only two or three participated in production, and the rest relied entirely on the money sent back by the workers to maintain their lives. Li Zhonglan, the wife of worker Hong Daohang, once said, "I would rather die than participate in labor." As a result, the worker's family not only wasted a lot in life, but also had a bad influence on the peasants. But this year, thanks to the education and mobilization of the workers, all 36 workers' families have participated in production.

    Because they participated in production, they also became concerned about the cooperative. When the team lacked funds to purchase fertilizer, the workers' families automatically invested 270 yuan. Li Renhua, the wife of Shanghai worker Hong Daohai, took the lead in investing 60 yuan, driving other workers' families to invest.

    The workers and their families' care and help for the agricultural cooperative have boosted the production enthusiasm of the team members. Member Hong Meizhou said, "The workers' families have turned dead money into live money, investing in fertilizer to strive for a bumper harvest for the whole team. This is a great contribution!"; "The worker comrades are so concerned about the cooperative, if we don't work hard and strive for a bumper harvest, we will be letting down the working class."

    他们热爱家乡的农业社
    于风
      “去年入社后，我没有参加过生产。两个儿子是工人，他们寄回来的钱就够养活我。可我最怕大儿媳妇，生产队长嘛，总要派我劳动。我嘴里答应着，从后门出去转转就溜走了，不是上街喝茶就是跑小铺里去呱呱。
      “今年可不中了，两个儿子假期回来，都动员我参加生产。他们说我才四、五十岁，身体又好，不劳动咋行。我想这也是话，我能劳动却不劳动，真是不应该。今年我参加了劳动，全队拉犁、挑担用的草绳都由我一人包工搓，我还和其他两位老农负责稻种催芽等工作呢！”
    这一段话是安徽肥东县星光农业社二十二队社员洪道坤讲的。
    二十二队共六十七户社员，其中三十六户都有人在上海、南京、芜湖等地的工厂做工。这些工人非常关心农业合作社。他假期回家省亲，总要主动地找社、队干部和社员们一块谈谈，了解合作社的情况。去年春节，他们知道农村的文化娱乐活动很少，回厂后就给合作社寄来了一百元作为修建俱乐部的费用，以后陆续又寄来了二、三百本书籍和娱乐、体育用品。今年春节，工人们回来看见社员、干部因去年灾情造成减产，情绪低落，便主动召开了工农座谈会。工人们在会上详细地询问了合作社去年的情况，和社干部一起分析了存在的问题。最后他们鼓励农业社干部说：“第一年办合作社总会有些曲折，但决不能被困难吓住。”最后，他们表示今年要支持合作社争取丰收，并要和社经常取得联系，以便了解情况，有困难就及时援助。他们还马上拿出了六十元，作为队里的生产资金。
    工人们还积极动员家属参加生产和节约用钱，向队里投资。去年三十六户工人家属，除两、三户参加生产外，其余都不参加，完全靠工人寄回来的钱维持生活。工人洪道行的爱人李中兰曾说：“我死也不参加劳动。”结果，工人家属不但在生活上有很大浪费，对农民影响也不好。但今年由于工人的教育和动员，三十六户工人家属，全部参加了生产。
    因为她们参加了生产，对合作社也就关心起来啦。队里缺乏资金购买肥料，工人家属就自动投资二百七十元。上海工人洪道海的爱人李仁华首先投资六十元，带动其他工人家属投资。
    工人和工人家属对农业社的关怀和帮助，鼓舞了全队社员的生产积极性。社员洪美洲说：“工人家属把死钱变成活钱，投资买肥料争取全队丰收，这个功劳不小。”；“工人同志这样关心合作社，我们不好好干，争取丰收，就对不起工人阶级了。”
