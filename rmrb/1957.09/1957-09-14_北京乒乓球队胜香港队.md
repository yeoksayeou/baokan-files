　　Beijing Ping Pong Team Defeats Hong Kong Team

　　(Our newspaper reports) The Hong Kong ping pong team played a friendly match against the Beijing team in the Beijing Gymnasium last night, featuring women's singles and men's team events. As a result, each side won one match in the women's singles, and the Beijing team won the men's team event with a score of 5-3. Vice Premier of the State Council Deng Xiaoping, He Long, and Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng watched the match.

　　The first match of the men's team event was Rong Guotuan of Hong Kong against Wang Chuanyao of Beijing. Rong Guotuan used a very strong backspin serve to force Wang Chuanyao to slowly chop the ball, and at the same time took the opportunity to use a fast push, making Wang Chuanyao run from side to side, unable to use his specialty of backhand smash, winning the first game 21-18. In the second game, Wang Chuanyao gradually became familiar with Rong's serve, so he switched to forehand and backhand smashes, and won 21-11. The third game was even more intense, with the score tied at 16. Wang lost consecutive points due to excessive tension, touching the net and going out of bounds, eventually losing 17-21.

　　The second match between Jiang Yongning and this year's Hong Kong runner-up Deng Hongbo was also very intense. Deng used fierce forehand and backhand smashes combined with short balls, and when Jiang Yongning hurriedly rushed forward to save the ball, Deng immediately smashed Jiang Yongning's middle. However, Jiang Yongning had rich match experience, steady chops, and saved many dangerous balls. At the same time, he took the opportunity to give Deng high balls, tempting Deng to smash the ball out of bounds. As a result, Jiang Yongning won two consecutive games 21-18.

　　In the third and fourth matches, Fu Qifang and Wang Chuanyao respectively defeated Wu Guohai and Deng Hongbo.

　　In the fifth match between Fu Qifang and Rong Guotuan, Rong Guotuan, with his rich match experience, pinned down Fu Qifang's left corner, using Fu's weakness of not being able to backhand smash to launch a fierce attack, forcing the offensive Fu Qifang to defend with chops. As a result, Fu Qifang lost 2-1.

　　At this point, the Beijing team was ahead 3-2. When Jiang Yongning played against Wu Guohai, Jiang won two consecutive games with steady defense. Unexpectedly, in the next match, Fu Qifang lost 2-0 to Deng Haibo, making the score 4-3. In the eighth match between Wang Chuanyao and Wu Guohai, Wang Chuanyao suppressed Wu Guohai with smashes and won the final victory 2-0. (Guo An)

　　北京乒乓球队胜香港队
    本报讯  香港乒乓球队昨晚在北京体育馆内，对北京队进行了一场女子单打和男子团体赛的友谊比赛。比赛结果，女子单打双方各胜一场；男子团体赛，北京队以五比三获胜。国务院副总理邓小平、贺龙，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞观看了这场比赛。
    男子团体赛第一对是香港队容国团对北京队王传耀。容国团以发很厉害的下旋球迫使王传耀慢慢地搓球，同时趁机用快速的推挡，使王传耀左右奔跑，不能使用反手猛抽的专长，以二十一比十八胜得了第一局。第二局，王传耀已渐渐熟悉了容的发球，于是改用正反手猛抽，结果以二十一比十一取胜。第三局双方争夺更激烈，打到十六平时，王因过分紧张，接连碰网、出界，最后以十七比二十一败北。
    第二场姜永宁对今年香港亚军邓洪波的比赛也很紧张。邓以猛烈的正、反手抽击配合放短球，当姜永宁急忙赶前救球时，邓立即猛抽姜永宁的中路。但是姜永宁比赛经验丰富，削球稳健，救出了不少险球，同时趁机给邓高球，诱邓猛抽出界。结果姜永宁以两个二十一比十八连取两局。
    第三、第四场傅其芳、王传耀分别胜了吴国海、邓洪波。
    第五场傅其芳对容国团比赛时，富有比赛经验的容国团压住了傅其芳的左角，利用傅不能反手抽球的弱点，进行猛攻，迫使善攻的傅其芳以削球来防守，结果傅其芳以二比一败北。
    这时北京队已以三比二占先。姜永宁对吴国海时，姜以稳健的守球连胜两局，不料下一对傅其芳又以二比零败给邓海波，比数成四比三。在第八对王传耀对吴国海时，王传耀以猛抽压住了吴国海，以二比零取得了最后的胜利。（国安）
