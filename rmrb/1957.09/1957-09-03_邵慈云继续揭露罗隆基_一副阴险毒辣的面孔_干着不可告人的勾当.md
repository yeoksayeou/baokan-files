Shao Ciyun Continues to Expose Luo Longji
A Sinister and Vicious Face Engaged in Unspeakable Activities
(Our Newspaper) This reporter has learned that at the ninth rectification forum held by the China Democratic League on August 30th and 31st, Luo Longji's secretary, Shao Ciyun, made a detailed expose of Luo Longji's conspiratorial activities since returning to China. Here is a summary of Shao Ciyun's speech.

Shao Ciyun said: As soon as Luo Longji returned to China, he indicated that his problem was not significant, that he was merely an "extra," and that the main actors were Zhang Naiqi and others. Therefore, he did not intend to confess his own problems, let alone expose other right-wing elements, especially Zhang Bojun, whom he intentionally took care of. He said to me, "Ye Duyi asked me to expose Zhang Bojun. Why should I expose him? I don't know much." He also said, "My younger brother (Luo Zhaolin) told me not to implicate too many people, which is also correct. If I implicate others, they will expose even more about me in return." On July 1, when the People's Daily published an editorial entitled "The Bourgeois Direction of Wenhui Bao Should Be Criticized," which pointed out that many of the bourgeois right-wingers were "leading figures who could be treated leniently and not punished," he distorted the meaning of this passage with ulterior motives. He emphasized that his was a "problem of thought," an internal contradiction among the people, and further denied and quibbled about his crimes.

Because Luo Longji's crimes of opposing the Party and socialism were conclusive, and he refused to honestly confess, he always tried to sound out and pry into others' attitudes. On June 25, when Luo Longji made his first confession to the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, it coincided with the time of the State Council meeting. He said to me, "Tonight, I want to go to the State Council meeting to see what the Premier's attitude is, but I can't miss the rectification meeting of the China Democratic League. Please call the State Council and tell them that I will definitely rush to the State Council after the China Democratic League meeting is over and ask them to report to the Premier." He also paid close attention to observing others' attitudes in Minister Li Weihan's office. In early July, after returning from the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee, he said, "I don't think the Party necessarily has any materials. Li Weihan is still very polite to me. It wasn't like this during the Zhang Dongsun incident!"

Shao Ciyun said: On July 3, after the Central Committee of the China Democratic League read out the letter I wrote to Chairman Shen Junru exposing Luo Longji at the rectification meeting, he questioned me on the one hand why I didn't tell him in advance so that he could confess himself. On the other hand, he threatened me and said, "Your letter, like my rehabilitation proposal, has played a role in setting fires..." Then, he said to me in a milder tone, "Don't write letters anymore. Tell me before you write a letter so that I can prepare." Luo Longji was very concerned about Zhao Wenbi's situation. When I told him that Zhao Wenbi had begun to confess, he quickly asked, "What is he confessing? I should know!" Why was Luo Longji so anxious when he heard Zhao Wenbi's confession? Everyone will know this.

After the opening of the National People's Congress, Luo Longji was indeed a bit "sad" and worried that the Congress would make some decision about him. On the afternoon of the closing of the National People's Congress, he learned that the Congress would not make any decision about them, and his arrogance rose again. He immediately wrote a letter to Chairman Liu Shaoqi, saying in essence: The Jiangxi group of the National People's Congress and the Central Committee of the China Democratic League only allowed confessions and did not allow explanations. Not long after the confession at the National People's Congress, Luo Longji put forward so-called supplementary materials of more than 20,000 words. In that "supplementary material," he not only overturned all the confessions he had made at the National People's Congress but also refuted the accusations against him one by one. What was especially vicious was that, apart from Pu Xixiu and Zhao Wenbi, he almost universally launched personal attacks on the rest of the people who had exposed his conspiracy.

In order to prevent me from exposing him, Luo Longji never relaxed the opportunity to win me over. He often pretended to be very kind and asked me with great concern: "Are you getting along well in the ministry! Are they suspicious of you!" "Isn't Sun Pingyi (a Party member) not telling you anything," "Politics is not a game; in this case, do you 'dare' to speak out," "The Communist Party only talks about right and wrong, not about warmth, and we petty bourgeoisie value warmth," On the other hand, he expressed a very welcoming look and said, "It's good that you still come to me; no one else dares to come..." Thus, after he returned to China, my position in front of him seemed to have "suddenly increased," which was completely different from his cold and contemptuous attitude towards me before he went abroad.

Here I will expose two more things he tried to do through me to form an offensive and defensive alliance with him.

Luo Longji's actions prove that he knew the content of the "Party's world" fallacy in advance.

1. After Luo Longji returned to China, he categorically denied that he had read Chu Anping's speech draft on "The Party's World," but he did not expect Pan Dakui to reveal it again at the Sichuan group meeting of the National People's Congress. On June 27, he said to me nervously, "Regarding the issue of Chu Anping's speech draft, some people already believe that I haven't read it, and things were originally calm. But the bad thing is that Pan Dakui happened to say at the Sichuan group meeting that I personally told him that I had read it. Who doesn't know the relationship between Pan and me? This is really a headache." I asked him back, "If you have read the speech draft, just confess it." He quickly said, "That's terrible. Not reading the draft is just being a right-winger, but reading it means having organization and action, wouldn't that make me a counter-revolutionary? The higher-ups suspect me and Zhang and Chu of having an organization. How can I admit it..." Not only that, but he even fantasized about using me to help him form an offensive and defensive alliance with Pan Dakui. He said to me, "This matter must be corrected by Pan at the Sichuan group meeting. I can't talk to Pan. I want you to visit Pan and ask him to 'correct' it. Pan lives in the New Qiao Hotel, and his wife has also come. Isn't he your teacher? It's very convenient for you to talk to him." Then he smiled and said, "Are you familiar with his wife? It's better to talk to his wife first..."

In his supplementary confession, Luo Longji said: "On June 2, Pu Xixiu first told me that Chu Anping's speech was too bold..." This is Luo Longji trying to explain that he did not know about Chu Anping's fallacy of "The Party's World" before Pu Xixiu told him. But the truth is not like this. Luo Longji's actions prove that he knew the content of the "Party's World" fallacy in advance.

First, at about 8 a.m. on June 2, when Zhao Wenbi went to Luo Longji's place to report and ask for instructions, he told Zhao Wenbi that Chu Anping had made comments to Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou. This shows that he already knew about Chu's speech early on June 2. At the same time, Pu Xixiu was not at his home early on June 2.

Second, then did Luo Longji meet with Pu on June 1? I say no. According to the work diary I kept for him, his work was extremely full that day. In the morning, he attended the reception for former French Prime Minister Faure held by the CPPCC until 2 p.m.; in the afternoon, he went to the ministry at 3 p.m. to give instructions until he got off work. In the evening, he attended the mass meeting held by Hehe and other units to support the Colombo Peace Conference until late at night. Therefore, it can be confirmed that he would not find Pu for a casual chat that day, and of course, he himself did not say that he met Pu on June 1. So where did he get the news from, so that he could talk to Zhao Wenbi about Chu's "Party's World" fallacy early in the morning of June 2?

Third, or Luo Longji said that he saw it in the newspaper. Chu spoke on June 1, and it would inevitably be reported on June 2, but the problem is that after Zhao Wenbi relayed the "Party's World" speech to me at Luo's house at 9 a.m. on June 2, I went to Luo's delivery room to find the newspaper. The newspaper had just arrived at that time, but Luo had already talked to Zhao Wenbi about Chu Anping's speech, and Luo had already gone to the China Democratic League. It can be seen that Luo Longji did not get the material from the newspaper.

Therefore, from the above facts, I am sure that Luo Longji knew the content of Chu Anping's "Party's World" speech in advance, which is beyond doubt, otherwise he would not have talked to Zhao Wenbi about it.

Personally approved a reply to a counter-revolutionary element, calling for "creating public opinion"

2. The absurd proposal of the "Rehabilitation Committee" is one of Luo Longji's concrete actions to attack the Party. After Luo Longji returned to China, he thought that others did not know that he had replied to counter-revolutionary elements, asking them to "create public opinion" and carry out "rehabilitation." It was not until Vice Chairman Shi Liang of the China Democratic League officially exposed it at the meeting that he panicked, trying to shirk responsibility on the one hand, emphasizing that the printing of the reply was done by the secretary, and on the other hand, he raised severe questions to me. Early in the morning of July 1, he called me several times in a row, asking me, "How did my approval documents get into Shi Liang's hands?" I told him that the approval documents were in the ministry and were kept by Secretary Sun. He said, "This is your responsibility. Why did you hand it over to Sun Pingyi? This constitutes my evidence of guilt, which is going to put me to death." He also said, "Did Sun Pingyi do it, or did you do it? You have to think about it." Here, it is necessary to state that the reason why Luo Longji's handwritten approval to reply to counter-revolutionary elements, asking them to "create public opinion," was handed over to Sun Pingyi was because it was ironclad evidence of his opposition to the Party. As for Vice Chairman Shi Liang's questions to Luo Longji, I can state that it was I who reported it to him.

After that, he rushed to the ministry. After he saw his handwritten approval, he had nothing to say. But he was indeed a cunning and deceitful political swindler, and he immediately shifted his target, not talking about the motive of his approval, but repeatedly emphasizing that I should not have printed it. The most heinous thing was that on July 2, he actually threatened and rebuked me with a tough attitude, saying, "What am I afraid of? I didn't ask you to print it. You have to take responsibility. You have to declare that you printed it." As if the seriousness of the problem was printing the reply draft, not the insidious motive of his approval. In fact, even printing the reply was approved by his confidant Zhao Wenbi. For this reason, I had a sharp argument with Luo Longji, this right-wing leader, on this day. In order to expose his ugly face, I will quote part of my conversation with him here:

Me: I did the printing, but this was executing your instructions. You approved the reply, and there were too many letters to write them all. I think the problem is not in printing, but in the motive of your approval to "create public opinion from all walks of life." What purpose did you prepare to achieve with this approval?

Luo: The motive is in the mind, who can see it, but printing becomes an action. If it were handwritten, the situation would be better, but printing is preparing to set a large number of fires. Can I bear this? You should "confess"! (?)

Me: Where should I "confess"?

Luo: Go to the China Democratic League Congress to "confess." You say that you printed it yourself, and that Minister Luo didn't ask you to print it. You should declare that although Minister Luo approved the reply on May 29, calling for the creation of public opinion, he instructed again on June 2 that "no" reply was to be made, and that you misunderstood the minister's intention.

Me: I am handling matters according to the minister's approval. You clearly instructed me on June 2 that "every letter must be replied to." I cannot distort the facts.

Luo: That won't work. If you "confess" like this, I'm finished. You should be responsible. If you take responsibility, it's just a mistake, but if I take responsibility, it's an action.

Me: Can this be said to be "framing" you? This is the fact. Why don't you dig into the ideological roots of your approval? I can declare that I handled the printing.

Luo: It's not "can" declare, it's "must" declare. You must never say that you handled it according to the minister's approval.

Me: What do you want me to say?

Luo: That's not right either. You ask me what to say. Okay, in the future, you will say that Luo Longji told you to say this. You tell me what you should say yourself.

Me: I said that printing was my request to Director Zhao (i.e., Zhao Wenbi) because there were too many letters. The reply was based on the minister's instructions.

Luo: (Getting angry) Will this work? It's that simple. You have to say that Luo's approval was only for one letter, and on June 2 (the day before he went abroad), he instructed that no reply should be made.

Me: You didn't say not to reply on June 2. You said that all incoming letters should be replied to.

Luo: (Furious, slapping the sofa) No! Isn't this framing me? Pan Dakui, Zhang Bojun, and others said that I had read Chu Anping's speech draft. They will be responsible for it when we confront each other in the future (meaning that I will also be responsible if I "frame" him). You should "confess" truthfully.

Me: Where am I not being truthful? I want to be responsible to the country, to the Party, and also to you, and also to myself. Why do you only emphasize the details and not examine the fundamental motives? I think this attitude is a bit putting the cart before the horse.

Luo: (Even more furious) You say you are responsible to the Party. I don't object to you, but you can't aggravate my crime.

What was the purpose of clamoring for the establishment of a "Rehabilitation Committee"?

Luo Longji proposed a rehabilitation committee and called for reactionary elements to create public opinion, so how many so-called "wronged" cases were in his hands waiting for rehabilitation? I must reveal that there were only five cases. This is the material basis for his clamoring that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was wrong and that a rehabilitation committee should be established.

Perhaps Luo Longji himself felt that there were too few materials to make a sensational statement. So he set his mind on fabricating facts and wanted to exaggerate them at the summary of the intellectual symposium. So he wrote in the summary outline that he had more than 20 materials. I was startled when I saw it. This was four or five times more than the actual number of letters received, which was too far off the topic, so I pointed it out to him, and he had no choice but to revise his outline.

Even if there are problems with the above-mentioned cases, the Party has long made serious treatment based on the policy of "counter-revolutionaries must be suppressed, and mistakes must be corrected." For example, Luo Longji raised the Chen Kun issue in March, and the Ministry of Public Security immediately conducted an investigation. On April 11, it sent a report on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in the Sichuan Institute of Technology, proving that Chen Kun was a bad element and that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was not a miscarriage of justice. In the case of Sun Xiangfeng in Wuxi, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress forwarded a letter from the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee on May 9, which said that the Ministry of Public Security had studied the Sun case as early as December last year (before Luo Longji and others reported it) and had leniently released him on March 18.

Finally, Shao Ciyun said: Now I want to warn Luo Longji. Didn't you want me to "confess"? I came to the China Democratic League precisely to respect your opinion, but I am not confessing, but making new accusations against you at the conference. I advise Luo Longji to take back the word "confess" that he used on me. It is you yourself who need to confess.

    邵慈云继续揭露罗隆基
    一副阴险毒辣的面孔  干着不可告人的勾当
    本报讯  在8月30、31日民盟举行的第九次整风座谈会上，罗隆基的秘书邵慈云对罗隆基这次回国后的阴谋活动，作了详尽的揭发。这里是邵慈云的发言摘要。
    邵慈云说：罗隆基一回国就表示自己问题不大，不过是个“陪客”，主角是章乃器他们。所以他没有打算交代自己的问题，更没有打算揭发其他右派分子，特别对章伯钧有意照顾，他对我说：“叶笃义叫我揭发章伯钧，我揭他干什么？我知道的也不多。”又说：“我弟弟（罗兆林）告诉我，不要把人牵扯太多，这话也对，我牵扯别人，别人倒过来揭发我更多”。7月1日当人民日报发表了“文汇报资产阶级方向应当批判”的社论中，指出了资产阶级右派中许多是一些“头面人物，可以宽大为怀不予办罪”的话后，他就别有用心地曲解了这段话的含义。强调自己是“思想问题”，是人民内部矛盾，并进一步对自己的罪行进行抵赖与狡辩。
    由于罗隆基反党、反社会主义罪行确凿，而又不肯老实交代，因此，总想到处摸底、窥测别人的态度。6月25日，罗隆基向民盟中央作第一次交代时，恰恰与国务院会议时间冲突。他对我说：“今晚国务院会我想去看总理是什么态度，可是民盟整风会又不能不参加。你给国务院打个电话，说民盟会散之后我一定赶到国务院，请他们务必报告总理。”他在李维汉部长处也非常注意窥测别人的态度。7月上旬，他从中央统战部回来后，曾说：“我觉得党不一定有什么材料，李维汉对我还是很客气。当年张东荪事件可不是这样呀！”
    邵慈云说：7月3日，民盟中央在整风会上宣读了我为揭发罗隆基写给沈钧儒主席的信后，他一方面质问我为什么不事先告诉他，以便由他自己去交代。另一方面又威胁我说：“你的信如同我那平反建议一样，是起了放火作用……。”接着，又用缓和的口气向我说：“不要写信了，要写信先告诉我一声，我好作准备。”罗隆基很关心赵文璧的情况，当我告诉他赵文璧已经开始交代时，他连忙问：“他交代什么？应该让我知道呀！”罗隆基为什么听到赵文璧交代就这么着急呢？这大家会知道的。
    人民代表大会开幕后，罗隆基的确有些“悲哀”，怕大会对他作出什么决定。人大闭幕下午，他得知大会不对他们作任何决定，他的气焰又高了，立即给刘少奇委员长写了一封信，大意是说：人大江西小组和民盟中央只许交代不容解释。人大交代后不久，罗隆基又提出了洋洋二万言的所谓补充材料，在那个“补充材料”中，他不仅将在人大所已经交代的全部推翻，对别人揭发他的罪行逐条加以辩驳，尤其恶毒的是：除了浦熙修和赵文璧外，他对其余揭发了他的阴谋的人，几乎普遍进行了人身攻击。
    罗隆基为了阻止我对他的揭发，从没有放松对我拉拢的机会。他往往是伪装得很和善，很关心地问我：“你在部里好不好处呀！他们是不是怀疑你呀！”“孙平毅（党员）是不是不和你讲什么了”，“搞政治可不是好玩的，在这种情况下，你‘还敢’鸣放不”，“共产党只讲是非，不讲温情，像咱们小资产阶级是讲点温情的”，另一方面则表示极为欢迎的样子说：“你很好还到我这来，别人都不敢来了……”于是在他回国之后，我在他面前的地位，似乎“突然增高”，这与他出国前对我那种冷眼蔑视，不睬不理的态度，何啻天渊。
    这里我再揭发两件他企图通过我给他订攻守同盟的事情。
    罗隆基的行动证明，“党天下”谬论的内容他是事先知道的。
    一、罗隆基回国以后，曾绝口否认他看过储安平“党天下”的发言稿，但他没料到潘大逵在人大四川小组会上又给他抖了出来。6月27日，他神色紧张地对我说：“关于储安平发言稿问题，有人已经相信我没有看过，事情本来已经平静了。但糟糕的是潘大逵偏偏在四川小组会上说我亲口对他讲我看过，谁不知道潘与我的关系，这事真伤脑筋。”我反问他一句：“就是看了发言稿，交代不就行了吗”。他连忙说：“那还了得，没看稿子只不过是右派，看了就是有组织有行动，岂不成了反革命了。上面正是怀疑我与章、储有组织，我怎么能承认……。”这还不算，他甚至异想天开地妄想利用我去帮他与潘大逵订立攻守同盟，他对我说：“这事必须潘在四川小组会上更正，我又不能和潘谈。我想你去找潘一趟，叫他‘更正’。潘住新侨饭店，爱人也来了，他不是你的老师吗？你同他谈很方便的。”继而又笑笑说：“你和他爱人熟不熟，先和他爱人谈更好……。”
    罗隆基在他的补充交代中说是：“6月2日浦熙修首先告诉我储安平发言太胆大了……。”这是罗隆基企图说明他在浦熙修告诉他以前，是不知道储安平的“党天下”的谬论的。但真象并不是如此。罗隆基的行动证明他是事先知道“党天下”谬论的内容的。
    第一，6月2日上午八点多钟，赵文璧去罗隆基处汇报请示时，他就对赵文璧说了储安平给毛主席与周总理提了意见的话。这说明6月2日一早他已知道储的发言。同时，6月2日一早浦熙修并不在他家。
    第二，那么罗隆基6月1日是否和浦见了面呢？我说不会。根据我为他作的工作日记，这一天他的工作排得极满，上午他参加政协接见法国前总理富尔的招待会至下午二点；下午三点多到部指示工作直到下班。晚出席和大等单位为支持科伦坡和平会议召开的群众大会直到夜深，因此，可以肯定他这天不会找浦闲谈，当然他自己也没有说是6月1日和浦见了面。那么从何处得来消息，在6月2日一大早即可向赵文璧谈到储的“党天下”的谬论呢。
    第三，或者罗隆基说是看到报纸的，储是6月1日发言，2日必然见报，但问题是6月2日上午九点多钟我去罗家听到赵文璧向我转述“党天下”发言后，才到罗的传达室找到报纸，那时报纸刚来，但罗已经向赵文璧谈过了储安平发言，并且罗已经到民盟去了。可见罗隆基又决非自报上得来材料。
    因此，从以上这些事实中，我肯定认为罗隆基事先知道储安平“党天下”发言的内容，是不容置疑的，否则不会向赵文璧谈及。
    亲手批示给反革命分子复信叫“造成舆论”
    二、“平反委员会”的荒谬建议，是罗隆基向党进攻的具体行动之一。罗隆基回国后，以为别人不知道他曾给反革命分子复信，要他们“造成舆论”，进行“平反”。直到民盟史良副主席在会上正式揭出，他才惊慌失措，一方面企图卸责，强调打印复信是秘书办的，另方面则向我提出严厉质问。7月1日一早，他一连串给我打了几次电话，问我：“我的批件怎么会到史良手里去了”，我告诉他批件在部内，由孙秘书保管着。他说：“这是你管的事，凭什么要交给孙平毅？这构成了我的罪证，这要置我于死地的。”又说：“是孙平毅搞的还是你搞的，你要想想。”这里有必要声明一下，关于罗隆基指示给反革命分子复信要他们“造成舆论”的亲笔批示，所以交给孙平毅，因为是他反党的铁的罪证。至于史良副主席对罗隆基的质问，我可以声明，正是我反映给他的。
    之后，他赶忙跑到部里，当他看到自己的亲笔批示后，无话可讲了。但他究竟是老奸巨猾的政治骗子，马上就转移目标，不说他批示的动机，反而一再强调我不该打印。最可恶的是他在7月2日居然以强硬态度对我恐吓和斥责，说：“我怕什么，我没有叫你打印呀，你要负责，你要声明是你打印的。”好像问题的严重是打印了复信稿，而不是他批示的阴险动机。事实上，就是打印复信也是他的亲信赵文璧批准的。为此，我在这一天和罗隆基这一个右派头子展开了一场尖锐的争论。为了揭发他的丑恶面目，在这里引用部分我与他的对话：
    我：打印是我打的，但这是执行你的指示，你批示叫回信，信太多不能件件都写。我看问题不在于打印，而是你批示“由各界造成舆论”的动机，这样批示准备达到什么目的？
    罗：动机在脑子里谁看得见，可是打印就成了行动，要是用手写情况还好一点，而打印就是准备大批放火，这我受得了吗？你应该“交代”！（？）
    我：到那去“交代”呀？
    罗：到民盟大会去“交代”。你说是你自己打印，不是罗部长叫你打印的，你应该声明罗部长虽然5月29日批示回信叫造成舆论，但6月2日又指示“不要”复了，是你体会错了部长的意图。
    我：我是奉部长批示办理，你6月2日分明指示我说：“每信必复，”我不能歪曲事实。
    罗：那不行，你这样“交代”我就完了，你应该负责。你承担只不过是错误，我承担则是行动。
    我：这说得上“陷害”你吗？这是事实，你怎么不挖掘你批示时的思想根源，我可以声明打印是我办的。
    罗：不是“可以”声明，是“必须”声明，你决不能说是奉部长批示办理。
    我：你叫我怎么说呢？
    罗：这又不对了，你问我怎么说，好，将来你又说是罗隆基叫你这么说的，你自己讲你该怎么说。
    我：我说打印是我请示赵主任（即赵文璧），因信太多。回信则是根据部长指示。
    罗：（发火了）这行吗？就这么简单，你要说罗批示只是一封信，而在6月2日（出国前一日）又指示叫不要答复了。
    我：你6月2日没说不要答复，你是说所有来信都要回信。
    罗：（火了，手拍着沙发）不行！这不是陷害我吗？潘大逵、章伯钧等说我看过储安平发言稿，将来对证起来他们要负责任（用意是我“陷害”他也要负责任），你应该实事求是的“交代”。
    我：我那点不实事求是，我要对国家负责，对党负责，也要对你负责，也要对自己负责。你为何只强调枝节，不从根本动机检查，我觉得这种态度有点本末倒置。
    罗：（更火了）你说对党负责，我不反对你，但不能给我加重罪过。
    叫嚣成立“平反委员会”是为了什么？
    罗隆基提出平反委员会，叫反动分子造成舆论，那么究竟他手中掌握了多少待平反的所谓“冤屈”案件呢？我必须揭出，只有五件，这就是他叫嚣肃反搞错了，要成立平反委员会的物质基础。
    也许罗隆基自己也感到材料太少，还不能危言耸听。于是安心捏造事实，想在知识分子座谈总结上加以夸大。于是在总结提纲上写着他就有二十多件材料。我看到后，骇了一跳，这比实际所收到的来信多了四、五倍，未免离题太远，于是给他指出，他不得已才修改了他的提纲。
    就算上述几个案件有问题，但党早已根据“有反必肃，有错必纠”的方针，作了严肃的处理。例如陈堃问题，罗隆基在3月份提出，公安部立即进行调查，4月11日即送来一份四川工学院肃反情况检查报告，证明陈堃是个坏分子，肃反被斗并不冤枉。无锡孙翔凤一案，人大常委会于5月9日转来中央统战部信，信中说，公安部早于去年12月（罗隆基等反映前），即对孙案进行研究，已于3月18日宽大释放。
    最后，邵慈云说：现在我要正告罗隆基。你不是要我“交代”吗？我正是尊重你的意见到民盟来了，可是我不是交代，而是向大会对你作新的揭发。奉劝罗隆基把对我使用的“交代”这两个字收回去，需要交代的正是你自己。
