　　Resolutely Crack Down on Criminal Elements
　　Wuhan: 700,000 People Receive Legal Education, Anti-Illegal Struggle Forms a Movement
　　(Our newspaper, Wuhan, 11th dispatch) A widespread and in-depth legal publicity campaign and a mass struggle against illegal and criminal activities are being carried out comprehensively in Wuhan.

　　After a series of political reforms and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in Wuhan, the remaining counter-revolutionary elements have been basically eliminated, and habitual thieves, bandits, and gang leaders left over from the old society have also been severely打击; however, because a few habitual criminals have escaped the net, or have not repented despite being 打击, they continue to commit crimes and sabotage production and construction. According to the recent detection of several major theft gangs, they stole more than 16,000 yuan worth of production and construction materials; the warehouse of the Eight Great Families (place name) of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Construction Company was stolen of more than 9,000 catties of steel and other materials in a week in early July. From January to August this year, there were 21 murder cases and 11 arson cases in the city. The masses are very indignant at these bad elements and demand that the government severely punish them.

　　In May, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Second Session of the Second Wuhan Municipal People's Congress respectively issued instructions and resolutions to widely and deeply carry out legal publicity and the struggle against illegal and criminal activities. After several months of activities, more than 700,000 people in the city have received legal education, and have further realized the serious harm of criminal offenders to the country and the people, thus exposing more than 4,000 pieces of information on illegal and criminal activities. The judicial organs have arrested more than 300 serious criminals who refused to confess and continued to commit crimes according to law.

　　At present, although this movement has achieved some success, some criminals are still very arrogant. The party and government leaders here are further mobilizing the masses, overcoming the right-leaning sentiment of some units, resolutely and thoroughly打击the activities of criminal elements, and pushing the movement to a climax.

　　坚决打击违法犯罪分子
　　武汉七十万人受到法制教育，反对违法斗争形成运动
    本报武汉11日电　广泛深入开展法制宣传和群众性的反对违法犯罪的斗争，正在武汉市全面地开展。
    武汉市经过一系列的政治改革和肃反运动，残存的反革命分子已基本肃清，旧社会遗留的惯盗、土匪、流氓头子等也受到了沉重打击；但是由于有少数刑事惯犯漏网，或者虽经打击仍没有悔改，他们继续为非作恶，破坏生产建设等。据最近查获的几个较大的盗窃集团就盗去生产建筑器材价值一万六千多元；武钢建设公司八大家（地名）仓库7月初一个星期中即被盗去钢材等九千多斤。今年1至8月份全市发生凶杀案件二十一起、纵火案十一起。群众对于这些坏分子非常义愤，要求政府严厉惩办。
    5月，中共武汉市委和市二届二次人民代表大会分别作出了广泛深入开展法制宣传和反对违法犯罪斗争的指示和决议，经过几个月的活动，全市已有七十万以上群众受到了法制教育，进一步认识到刑事犯罪分子对国家、对人民的严重危害性，从而揭发了四千多件违法犯罪活动的材料，司法机关依法逮捕了拒不坦白和继续犯案的严重犯罪分子三百多名。
    目前，这一运动虽然取得一些成绩，但有些犯罪分子仍很嚣张，此间党政领导正在进一步深入发动群众，克服某些单位的右倾情绪，坚决彻底地打击刑事犯罪分子的活动，把运动推向高潮。
