    Visiting the "East is Red" Agricultural Cooperative
    Head of Agricultural Cooperative Says Competition Conditions Agreed with Beijing Red Star Collective Farm Will Not Fail!
    In Bulgaria, one can feel the warmth of the close friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian people everywhere. At the "East is Red" agricultural cooperative in Ailin Pilin Village, Ailin Pilin County, Sofia Oblast, I was once again moved by this friendship.
    On the wall of the office of Boris Niezhnev, the party organization leader of the "East is Red" agricultural cooperative, hangs a full-body portrait of Chairman Mao "The East is Red," and below the portrait is a red banner written in Chinese characters: "May the friendship between China and Bulgaria be forever consolidated and prosperous." Here, Niezhnev and cooperative chairman Peter Valakinov warmly received the reporter with fresh apples produced by the cooperative and introduced the development of the cooperative.
    Since the establishment of the "East is Red" agricultural cooperative, the number of farmers joining the cooperative has increased year by year due to the continuous growth of output and daily labor remuneration. Up to now, the number of farmers joining the cooperative has reached 657 households, with 13,560 decares (each decare equals 1.5 Chinese mu) of cultivated land. It is expected that by the end of autumn this year, the entire village will fully realize cooperation. Niezhnev pointed to the banner "May the friendship between China and Bulgaria be forever consolidated and prosperous" on the wall and said with a smile: "Our cooperative is becoming more and more consolidated and prosperous, just like the friendship between China and Bulgaria..."
    The cooperative chairman then talked about the difficulties they encountered in the socialist friendship competition with the Red Star Collective Farm in the suburbs of Beijing. At the beginning of this year, the "East is Red" agricultural cooperative accepted the proposal from the Red Star Collective Farm to carry out a socialist friendship competition between the two cooperatives. After enthusiastic discussions among all cooperative members, it was decided to meet the competition with conditions such as increasing the yield of various crops by 10% compared with last year and increasing the daily labor remuneration (in kind and cash) to 15.6 leva (Bulgarian currency). However, unexpectedly, they encountered unprecedented hail and floods this year, and all kinds of crops in the agricultural cooperative were destroyed, making the competition condition of increasing daily labor remuneration a difficult problem. The cooperative members were very anxious. Now, with the help of the government and the efforts of the cooperative members, the loss of crop destruction has been compensated by expanding animal husbandry and other sideline production, and this problem has been solved. After the disaster, the government successively allocated 147,000 leva in loans to the "East is Red" agricultural cooperative for the purchase of dairy cows, feed, and the construction of feeding sheds. With the help of the tractor station, the cooperative members actively re-plowed the destroyed fields and planted feed crops such as corn and millet. At present, the cooperative members have harvested the destroyed barley, wheat, oats, and other grains and made about 600 tons of feed. Due to the increase in feed and the improvement of management, the milk yield of dairy cows and dairy goats and the wool production of sheep in the "East is Red" agricultural cooperative are now the highest in the entire Sofia Oblast. In addition, the cooperative members have also built a new fish pond with an area of about 17 decares, which can increase income by more than 35,000 leva per year.
    After estimating the income from animal husbandry and fish farming, the head of the agricultural cooperative said to the reporter with satisfaction: "Please tell the comrades of the Red Star Collective Farm that the competition condition we proposed to increase daily labor remuneration will not fail."
    Then, the host accompanied the reporter to visit the agricultural cooperative's livestock farm, fish pond, and the thriving seedlings that had sprouted after replanting. During the visit, the reporter was warmly greeted and greeted by the cooperative members who were working, as if they were honored guests. The host said with great interest that all Chinese friends who come to Bulgaria for visits must come to the "East is Red" agricultural cooperative to see and convey the friendship of the Chinese people, which has left a very deep impression on the cooperative members every time. The cooperative members are very interested in Chinese books and periodicals printed in Russian. Once they receive them, everyone rushes to read them. In order to allow each cooperative member to carefully look at the Chinese books and periodicals and Chinese gifts, and never forget the friendship of the Chinese people, the cooperative is preparing to build a "Chinese Gift Museum."

    访东方红农业社
    农业社负责人说，他们同北京红星集体农庄订立的竞赛条件一定不会落空！
    在保加利亚，处处都能感到中保两国人民亲密友谊的温暖。在索非亚州艾林彼林县艾林彼林村以“东方红”命名的农业社里，记者又一次为这种友谊所感动。
    东方红农业社党组织负责人鲍里斯·涅热夫办公室的墙壁上，悬挂着毛主席全身画像“东方红”，画像下边是一幅用中国字写的红布标语：“愿中保友谊永远巩固和繁荣”。在这里，涅热夫和社主席彼得·瓦拉基诺夫用社里生产的鲜苹果热情地接待了记者，介绍了合作社的发展。
    东方红农业社成立以来，由于产量和劳动日报酬不断增长，入社农户也逐年增加。到目前为止，入社农户已达六百五十七户，有一万三千五百六十狄卡尔（每狄卡尔合我国一市亩半）耕地，预计到今年秋末，全村将完全实现合作化。涅热夫指着墙上挂的“愿中保友谊永远巩固和繁荣”标语微笑着说：“我们的社就像中保友谊一样越来越巩固，越来越繁荣……。”
    社主席接着讲述了他们在同北京郊区红星集体农庄进行社会主义友谊竞赛中遇到的难题。今年初，东方红农业社接受了红星集体农庄提出的在两个社间进行社会主义友谊竞赛的建议。经过全体社员的热烈讨论，决定以各种农作物产量比去年提高10％、劳动日报酬（实物和现金）增加到十五点六列弗（保币）等条件来迎接竞赛。但是，想不到今年遇到了前所未有的冰雹和水灾，农业社各种作物全部被毁，提高劳动日报酬的竞赛条件成了难题。社员们都很焦急。现在在政府帮助和社员努力下，用扩大畜牧业和其他副业生产的办法，补偿了农作物被毁的损失，解决了这一问题。灾害过后，政府先后给东方红农业社拨了十四万七千列弗贷款，作为购买奶牛、饲料和修建饲养舍之用。社员们在拖拉机站帮助下，积极地重新翻耕了被毁田地，种上了包米、黍子等饲料作物。目前社员们已将被毁的大麦、小麦、燕麦等庄禾收割下来，作成了约六百多吨饲料。由于饲料增加和管理工作改善，现在东方红农业社的奶牛、奶羊出奶量和绵羊产毛量，是全索非亚州最高的一个社。另外，社员们还新修了一个面积约十七狄卡尔的鱼塘，每年可增加收入三万五千多列弗。
    农业社负责人在预计了畜牧业和养鱼业的收入以后，满意地对记者说：“请你转告红星集体农庄的同志们，我们提出的增加劳动日报酬的竞赛条件一定不会落空。”
    然后，主人陪同记者参观了农业社的牲畜饲养场、鱼塘和补种后已出土的茁壮的禾苗。参观时记者像贵宾一样受到正在进行劳动的社员们亲切的问候和致意。主人兴致勃勃地说，凡是来保加利亚访问的中国朋友，都要到东方红农业社看一看，转达中国人民的情谊，每次都给社员们留下了极深刻的印象。社员们对用俄文印成的中国书刊很感兴趣，一收到，大家就争着看。为了让每个社员都能仔细地看看中国书刊和中国礼物，时刻不忘中国人民的友情，合作社准备修建一个“中国礼物博物馆”。本报记者　李　成（附图片）
