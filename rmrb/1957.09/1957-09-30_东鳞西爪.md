　　Odds and Ends

　　Woolen Mill Built in Pastoral Area
　　The Lanzhou Woolen Mill, the largest woolen textile factory in Northwest China, began construction on the 28th. After this woolen mill is completed, the woolen cloth produced annually will be enough for 700,000 people to each make a woolen coat. In addition, it can produce 180,000 woolen blankets.
　　Northwest China is one of the centers of animal husbandry in our country, so the raw materials for this factory are guaranteed.

　　Hydropower Station Built on the Grassland
　　The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is building five small hydropower stations. These hydropower stations are being built in the rural areas of Aor'gai and Sanqu Grasslands in the Zhaowuda League, and Najitun, Kulun in the Jerim League, and Bikeqi in the Pingdi Spring Administrative Region in the Hulunbuir League. It is expected that they will all be completed by the end of this year. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　Power Station Built on the Taihang Mountains
　　Guai'er Village, a mountain village in the Taihang Mountains in Zuoquan County, Shanxi Province, has built a hydroelectric power station.
　　After Guai'er Village cooperativized in 1956, it jointly built a hydroelectric power station with Lujiazhuang. The power station was completed and started supplying electricity in September of this year.
　　Now, the agricultural cooperatives of the two villages have not only used electricity for irrigation and milling, but have also installed more than 500 electric lights. (Chen Houyu, Wang Airen)

    东鳞西爪
    畜牧区建毛纺厂
    西北最大的毛纺织厂——兰州毛纺织厂28日开工兴建。这座毛纺织厂建成以后，每年生产的呢料，可供七十万人各做一件呢衣。此外，还能生产十八万条毛毯。
    西北是我国畜牧业的中心之一，这个工厂的原料是有保证的。
    草原上修水电站
    内蒙古自治区正在兴建五座小型水电站。这些水电站修建在昭乌达盟的敖尔盖、三区草原和呼伦贝尔盟那吉屯、哲里木盟库伦、平地泉行政区毕克齐等农村里。预计今年底可以全部完工。（据新华社讯）
    太行山上有了电站
    太行山上的山村——山西省左权县拐儿村，建起了水力发电站。
  　拐儿村1956年合作化以后，跟路家庄联合兴建水力发电站。到今年9月电站全部竣工，并开始送电。
    现在，两个村的农业社除利用电力灌溉和磨面外，还安装了电灯五百多盏。　（陈厚裕、王艾仁）
