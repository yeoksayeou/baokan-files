In Socialist Countries, Anti-Socialist Newspapers are Not Allowed:
    Zhejiang News and Publishing Circles Shatter the Daydreams of Rightists

(Reported by our newspaper) In the anti-Rightist struggle over the past month or so, the news and publishing circles in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City have exposed a group of Rightist elements and Rightist cliques both inside and outside the Party. The main figures of these Rightists include: Gao Guang, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of Zhejiang Daily; reporters Guan Baiyu and Xu Qin; Tan Ke, the person in charge of Zhejiang People's Publishing House (actually responsible for the president's duties); Pan Yiping, Director of the Literature and Education Editorial Office; Lu Tian and Song Zhe, reporters for Zhejiang Workers' Daily; Wu Pengting, reporter for Hangzhou Daily and special correspondent for Wenhui Daily; and Yang Shao, reporter for the Zhejiang Branch of Xinhua News Agency. Two Rightist cliques were also exposed in Zhejiang Daily and Zhejiang People's Broadcasting Station. The members of the Rightist clique in Zhejiang Daily were Xie Yu, Chief Editor of the Literature and Art Group; Xia Qinhan, Deputy Chief Editor; Bai Ren, Assistant Chief Editor; and Ge Jin, editor. The members of the Rightist clique in Zhejiang People's Broadcasting Station were Zhou Yongming, Gu Jingfen, Gao Fuxiao, Li Dongye, Wang Xiuqiao, and other editors and reporters.

Last summer, Gao Guang, a Rightist element in Zhejiang Daily, took advantage of the period when Editor-in-Chief Yu Guanxi was away for study, and under the banner of "reforming the newspaper," drafted an inspection report calling on editors and reporters to "delve into the shortcomings and errors of actual work," and opposing the newspaper's coverage promoting advanced experiences. During this period, Zhejiang Daily published several consecutive issues featuring entire pages of so-called critical exposure reports that distorted the facts. Tan Ke, a Rightist element in Zhejiang People's Publishing House, opposed publishing popular booklets serving industrial and agricultural production, and advocated that in the future, more works should be published by "first-class authors" such as the Rightists Song Yunbin, Ren Mingshan, and Wang Zhong. The Rightist elements in Zhejiang People's Broadcasting Station, Zhejiang Workers' Daily, and Hangzhou Daily frantically clamored that the class struggle was basically over, and the role of newspapers as tools of class struggle should be weakened. They claimed that only by exposing a large number of dark sides of life could they represent the voice of the masses, etc.

These Rightist elements, without exception, attacked the Party committee and slandered and vilified the leadership of the Party. Pan Yiping also published fallacies such as "culture first," "worker-peasant cadres are no good," and "petty intellectuals cannot lead big intellectuals."

This group of Rightist elements also actively prepared to establish "Tongren Newspaper," "Tongren Radio Station," and "Tongren Publishing House" to rival the Party newspaper. For example, the Rightist clique in Zhejiang Daily wanted to establish "Comet Weekly," and Yang Shao, a Rightist element in the Zhejiang Branch of Xinhua News Agency, wanted to establish "West Lake Tourist Newspaper." They made meticulous plans and arrangements for personnel, organization, funding, paper, manuscript collection, distribution, and advertising. Yang Shao also planned to send the inaugural issue free of charge to stores, offices, and agencies in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Ningbo, and other places. He said, "In this way, no one will want to read Zhejiang Daily anymore."

During the period of great contending and blooming, this group of Rightist elements frantically demanded that the Party open up all secrets. They proposed that non-Party reporters should participate in all Party meetings and read internal Party documents.

After the anti-Rightist struggle began in the news and publishing circles of Zhejiang, this group of Rightist elements stubbornly resisted. However, when the masses rose up, all the Rightist elements revealed their true colors one by one. In the face of irrefutable facts, they had no choice but to bow their heads and admit their guilt.

    在社会主义国家不准办反社会主义的报纸
    浙江新闻出版界打破了右派分子的白日梦
    本报讯　浙江省、杭州市新闻出版界在一个多月来的反右派斗争中，揭发出一批党内外右派分子和右派小集团。这批右派分子主要人物有：浙江日报副总编辑高光、记者管白宇、编辑徐勤，浙江人民出版社负责人（实际担负社长责任）谭克、文教编辑室主任潘一平，浙江工人报记者鲁天、宋哲，杭州日报记者兼文汇报特约记者乌鹏廷，新华社浙江分社记者杨少；还在浙江日报和浙江省人民广播电台揭露了两个右派小集团。浙江日报右派小集团的成员是文教艺术组主编谢狱、副主编夏钦瀚、主编助理白刃、编辑葛进；浙江人民广播电台右派小集团的成员是周永明、顾井汾、高扶小、李冬野、汪秀樵等编辑、记者。
    浙江日报右派分子高光去年夏天利用总编辑余冠西去学习期间，打着“改革报纸”的旗号，通过他起草的一个检查报告，号召编辑、记者的思想要“钻到实际工作的缺点和错误中去”，反对报纸介绍推广先进经验的报道。而就在这段期间，浙江日报连续几期出现了整版整版的歪曲事实的所谓批评揭露的报道。浙江人民出版社右派分子谭克反对出版通俗的、为工农业生产服务的小册子，主张今后要多出 “第一流作者”右派分子宋云彬、任铭善、王中的作品。浙江人民广播电台、浙江工人报、杭州日报的右派分子疯狂地叫嚣：现在阶级斗争基本结束了，报纸作为阶级斗争工具的作用应该削弱，只有大量揭发生活的阴暗面，才能代表群众呼声等等。
    这些右派分子无例外地大肆攻击党委，污蔑和丑化党的领导。潘一平则发表“文化第一”、“工农干部不行”、“小知识分子不能领导大知识分子”等谬论。
    这批右派分子还积极筹办“同仁报”“同仁电台”“同仁出版社”同党报分庭抗礼，如浙江日报的右派小集团要办“慧星周刊”，新华社浙江分社右派分子杨少要办“西湖游报”等，并且从人事、组织、经费、纸张到组稿、发行、广告都预作周密的筹划和安排。杨少还计划将创刊号免费送沪、杭、甬等各商店、机关。他说：“这样一来，浙江日报就没有人要看了。”
    这批右派分子在大鸣大放中，猖狂地要求党开放一切机密。他们提出非党记者应该参加党的一切会议，阅读党内文件。
    浙江新闻出版界反右派斗争开始后，这批右派分子还顽强抵抗，可是当群众起来以后，所有右派分子都一一显露原形，在铁的事实面前，他们不得不低头认罪。
