In the Anti-Rightist struggle, seventeen senior engineering and technical personnel from the Ministry of Railways have been accepted into the Chinese Communist Party.

This group of newly admitted senior intellectuals have mostly undergone tempering in previous political movements, have made significant progress in ideological transformation, and have consistently been relatively active and hardworking in their work, study, and participation in mass activities. They have a correct understanding of the Party and are eager to join the Communist Party. In particular, during the initial wave of the rectification campaign with its "great blooming and contending," and after the start of the Anti-Rightist struggle, they were able to firmly stand on the proletarian stance and bravely launched ruthless struggles against the Rightists within the Ministry of Railways. Chen Peidong, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Railway Transportation Bureau, requested to participate in study sessions several times at the beginning of the rectification campaign. During the period of "blooming and contending" and in the Anti-Rightist struggle, he maintained a firm stance and unflinchingly exposed and criticized the reactionary words and deeds of the Rightist Du Zhenyuan, his former "old superior." Using personal experiences and comparisons between the past and present, he forcefully refuted Du Zhenyuan's fallacies of "caring but not asking, asking but not using, and using but not managing." Chen Jiyan, a member of the Communist Youth League in the Basic Construction Bureau, was able to deeply analyze the reactionary viewpoints of the Rightists during the encirclement and suppression of the Rightists, fully grasped the ideological changes of the Rightists, presented facts, reasoned, and besieged them step by step, until the Rightists were rendered speechless and had to surrender. Xie Guangyuan, an engineer in the Design Bureau, resolutely opposed the so-called "Seventeen-Person Committee," led by the Rightist Weng Meinong, which did not accept the leadership of the Communist Party, during the "great blooming and contending". After the start of the Anti-Rightist struggle, he thoroughly exposed and criticized this Rightist clique. Liu Fanggang, an engineer in the Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory Administration Bureau, had been relatively active in previous political movements. When the Rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party this time, he was able to step forward and resolutely defend the interests of the Party, using vivid examples to forcefully rebut the reactionary remarks of the Rightists who attempted to negate the achievements of the Party and the improvement of the people's lives. When the Rightists satirized him as a "believer of the Communist Party" and was met with hatred and insults from the Rightists, he did not waver.

Before accepting this group of senior intellectuals into the Party, the Party branch had solicited opinions from non-Party members and listened to their feedback. They believed that accepting these people into the Party was completely correct.

    反右派斗争中经受考验
    铁道部一批高级知识分子入党
    本报讯　铁道部机关在整风反右派斗争中，有十七名高级工程技术人员已被接受参加了中国共产党。
    这批新入党的高级知识分子大都是经过历次政治运动的锻炼，在思想改造方面有较显著的进步，工作、学习和参加群众活动一贯比较积极努力，对党有了正确的认识，迫切地要求参加共产党。特别是在这次整风之初大鸣大放的风浪中，以及在反右派开始后，他们能够坚定地站稳无产阶级立场，对铁道部机关内的右派分子，勇敢地不顾情面地展开了斗争。铁道部车务局副总工程师陈培栋，整风开始时曾几次要求参加学习，鸣放期间和反右派斗争中，立场坚定，毫不留情地揭发与批判了过去的“老上级”右派分子杜镇远的反动言行，以亲身感受与今昔对比，对杜镇远的“顾而不问、问而不用、用而不理”的谬论，进行了有力的驳斥。基本建设局共青团员陈继炎，在围攻右派分子中，能够深刻分析右派分子的反动论点，充分掌握右派分子的思想变化，摆事实，讲道理，步步围攻，最后使右派分子被驳得理屈词穷，不得不缴械投降。设计总局工程师谢光源，大鸣大放中坚决反对以右派分子翁美浓为首成立的不接受共产党领导的所谓“十七人委员会”。反右派斗争开始后，对这个右派小集团又进行了彻底的揭发与批判。机车车辆修理工厂管理局工程师刘方刚，历次政治运动比较积极，这次右派分子向党猖狂进攻时，能够挺身而出，坚决维护党的利益，以生动实例给予右派分子企图否定党的成绩、否定人民生活提高等反动言论以有力回击，当右派分子讽刺他是“共产党的信徒”，并遭到右派分子的仇视与辱骂时，他毫不动摇。
    在接受这批高级知识分子入党之前，党支部曾征求党外人士的意见和听取了他们的反映，他们认为接受这些人入党是完全正确的。
