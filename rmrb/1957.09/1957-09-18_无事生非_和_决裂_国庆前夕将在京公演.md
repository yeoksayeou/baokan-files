    "Much Ado About Nothing" and "The Breakup"
    To be Performed in Beijing Before National Day

    The seventy-plus students of the Shanghai Theatre Academy's performance teacher training class, led by Soviet expert Comrade Ye. Kang. Liepkovskaya, are about to graduate after a year and a half of study. During this time, the students, revolving around a series of relevant courses, rehearsed two plays: Shakespeare's famous comedy "Much Ado About Nothing" (also known as "Much Ado" or "Catching Shadows"), and "The Breakup" by Soviet writer Lavrenyov, which reflects the October Revolution uprising of the cruiser "Aurora." After the formal graduation performance of these two plays in Shanghai, they will be performed in Beijing before National Day this year.

    “无事生非”和“决裂”
    国庆前夕将在京公演
    苏联专家叶·康·列普柯芙斯卡娅同志领导的上海戏剧学院表演师资进修班的七十多个学员，经过一年半的学习，即将结业。在一年半的时间里，学员们环绕一系列有关课程，排练了两个剧目，一个是莎士比亚的著名喜剧“无事生非”（又名“无事烦恼”或“捕风捉影”），另一个是苏联作家拉甫列尼约夫写的反映十月革命“阿芙乐尔”巡洋舰起义的“决裂”。这两个剧目在上海正式结业公演后，将在今年国庆前夕来京公演。
