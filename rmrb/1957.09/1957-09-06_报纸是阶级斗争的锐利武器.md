    The Newspaper is a Sharp Weapon of Class Struggle
    Gan Xifen
    The bourgeois rightists have launched a fierce battle to seize socialist newspapers, attempting to seize the political leadership of newspapers, or at least first occupy several "beachheads" before organizing an attack. The rightists are very clear: the newspaper is one of the most acute weapons of class struggle. However, the rightists are afraid to speak out this harsh truth. They try every possible means to conceal this truth, and propagate that newspapers are things that are above class and above party affiliation, in order to achieve their shameful goal: since newspapers are above class and above party affiliation, then anyone can use it. Why must we run socialist newspapers, and not anti-socialist newspapers? The rightists believe that in this way they can obtain the right to establish so-called "fellow-traveler newspapers."
    Among the rightists, there is no shortage of so-called "strategists" who theoretically attack socialist newspapers. For example, Zheng Baitao of the China News Agency declared: "I think news should be like language, serving the society widely." This rightist grabbed a few words from Stalin's book "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics," comparing newspaper news, which can be explained by class concepts, with the language used by people in conversations, which has no class nature, yet he calls himself erudite and knows no shame!
    Wang Zhong, the head of the Journalism Department of Fudan University in Shanghai and a rightist within the Party, put on an even more theoretical face, pretending to seek the laws of development of journalism, and peddled everywhere the reactionary journalism theories he smuggled from Western bourgeois journalism. In Wang Zhong's nonsense, the core idea is the so-called "social need" theory. He believes that newspapers are not the product of class and class struggle, but the product of "social needs"; newspapers are "commodities" that people voluntarily spend money to buy, and only on the basis of commodity-ness can they play the role of propaganda tools. Wang Zhong scares us by saying: "Journalism has its own laws that are independent of human will," "Newspapers are the product of a certain society, which is determined by the needs of the society, not by the newspaper operator."
    Look, how much like a scientific materialist "theoretician" Wang Zhong pretends to be here! He uses "laws" to frighten people: You regard newspapers as a tool of class struggle? This is to make newspapers "determined by the newspaper operator," this is to violate materialism, this is to resist laws that are independent of human will!
    But we want to ask: What is "society"? The rightists are very happy to make a fuss about this. They regard society as a pile of abstract people, a vacuum above class. In our view, since the emergence of classes in human history, society has been a place where various groups and classes with different economic status restrict and struggle against each other. The rightists regard newspapers as irrelevant to class, and as universally serving the society like public utilities such as electricity, telephones, tap water, and buses (here we must remind you: public utilities themselves have no class nature, but in a class society, it is impossible for them to universally serve all classes; they belong to the class that owns them). In our view, newspapers are just a form of expressing class consciousness, and they have a strong and distinct class nature. If it does not belong to this class, it belongs to that class; if it does not serve this class, it serves that class; if it does not promote the views of this class, it promotes the views of that class; it is not produced to meet abstract social needs, but first to meet the specific needs of the class. This is the law! Rightist gentlemen, why are you afraid of this law?
    Of course, a person with basic common sense will not deny that the occurrence and development of newspapers need to rely on social economy, technology, transportation, and people's cultural level and other conditions. - Our argument with the rightists is not here. What we are arguing about is: Under such social conditions, who is promoting the development of newspapers? Is it an abstract society? Or a certain class force?
    The answer is obvious.
    "Dibao" (imperial gazette) was the earliest newspaper in China. What it published was "On a certain day, the emperor personally plowed the field to worship the god of agriculture, performing the nine-push ceremony. On a certain day, the officials performed the grand archery ceremony at the south of Anfu Tower. On a certain day, the leaders of the various foreign countries requested to follow the emperor in the Fengshan ceremony. On a certain day, the emperor returned from the Eastern Fengshan ceremony, and rewards were given accordingly. On a certain day, the prime minister and officials in Xuanzheng Gate argued for ten quarters and then dismissed." (See Ge Gongzhen's "History of Chinese Journalism," Chapter 2) Does this kind of newspaper serve the society? It merely publicizes court decrees and the words and deeds of the emperor, so as to help the dynasty rule. This kind of Dibao, naturally cannot avoid concealing evil and promoting good. Ge Gongzhen also said: "Therefore, what Dibao can record and transmit is only the things that are heard and seen, as for important confidential matters, they are lacking. Under autocracy, speech is strictly prohibited, this is the trend!" It can be seen that it is not something that universally serves the society.
    The institutions that first appeared in the Mediterranean coast in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to spread commercial news promoted the emergence of modern newspapers. It seems that it is far away from class struggle. But these news providers also did not serve any social needs, but served the emerging bourgeoisie. The development of capitalism made it imperative for the bourgeoisie to obtain information about ships, prices, and political events and wars in various places.
    The "Friend of the People" newspaper founded by the famous revolutionary leader Marat during the French Revolution cannot be said to have served the "society"; it issued a battle cry to completely destroy the feudal system, it was the horn of the French Revolution, and it served the bourgeois and petty bourgeois of the French Revolution. At about the same time, the newspapers in the American War of Independence did not disguise themselves as serving the society in any way. They did not hide the fact that they were weapons of political struggle. For example, Thomas Paine's "Common Sense" wrote: "The cause of America is the cause of all mankind, Oh! You - who love mankind, you - who dare to resist not only the tyrannical regime but also the tyrannical monarch - revolt!" ("A Course in Modern History", Xinhua Bookstore, 1950 edition, page 44) Here, it not only openly regards newspapers as tools of political struggle, but also, under the slogan of "loving mankind," shouted out the class demands of the bourgeoisie.
    China's modern printed newspapers were first founded by foreign imperialists, but please, rightist gentlemen, defend them and say that the newspapers they ran were in response to China's social needs, not to serve the purposes of imperialism.
    Who can produce strong evidence to prove that modern Western reactionary bourgeois newspapers serve the society? Western bourgeois newspapers have a large readership, most of whom are working people, but it is too ridiculous to regard this phenomenon as a manifestation of bourgeois newspapers serving the society. Because the people there can only read this kind of bourgeois thing. Although bourgeois newspapers try their best to expand their readership, it is only on the one hand to attract expensive advertisements, and on the other hand to expand the scope of the influence of bourgeois ideology. In the final analysis, it serves the bourgeoisie.
    We do not conceal that the object of our proletarian newspapers is unprecedentedly broad. We serve all working people, but we cannot say that our newspapers universally serve the society. We do not serve classes that are hostile to the people, but use newspapers to fight against them.
    The rightists say: Newspapers have readers from all classes, which shows that they universally adapt to "social needs." Ten thousand absurdities! Sir, Chiang Kai-shek also has to read newspapers from mainland China. You probably would say that the "People's Daily" also meets Chiang Kai-shek's "needs" and "serves" Chiang Kai-shek.
    In short, to distort the newspaper, a tool that strongly expresses the will of the class, into a tool for social service, this can only be an intentional obliteration of the class nature of the newspaper, so as to achieve the despicable purpose of forcing socialist newspapers to give way to the rightists. Stalin said in "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics" that the superstructure "serves the society with political, legal, aesthetic and other concepts," which cannot help the rightists at all; judging from Stalin's entire thought in the book, what he said about "serving the society" is precisely the meaning of serving a specific class.
    Now we have to study this issue from another perspective. Is it true that the emergence of a so-called "social need" can produce newspapers? No. The occurrence and development of newspapers, in addition to the social economic and cultural conditions that have been discussed before, also depends on the political conditions, political climate, and the comparison of class forces at that time. - This is something that the rightists cannot listen to.
    After the Opium War, the Chinese people, who were brutally invaded by foreign countries and oppressed by domestic reactionary rulers, desperately needed newspapers to serve the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal cause. However, the progressive newspapers founded by Liang Qichao, Zhang Taiyan, and Sun Yat-sen to meet the needs of the Chinese people were repeatedly suppressed, so that they had to go abroad to publish them. Why is this?
    The Chinese people have long needed their own newspapers that speak entirely from the standpoint of the people. This "social need" did not exist earlier, but only in the liberated areas, especially after the founding of New China, did the people's newspapers gain the conditions for free development. Why is this?
    Conversely, as long as the class that holds the ruling power needs them, newspapers that the "society" does not "need" at all can run rampant everywhere. For example, the Kuomintang's "Central Daily News," "Sweeping News," and "Zhenzhong Daily" are such newspapers. Why is this?
    Doesn't this prove how absurd and utterly ridiculous the rightist's argument that newspapers are determined by social needs, not by class needs, is!
    But the rightist gentlemen will continue to wear masks and accuse us, saying: "You have committed the idealist error. You say that the development of newspapers is determined by the development of class struggle. You have violated the principle of Marxism that the laws are independent of human will."
    This question is rather childish. Because the law of newspaper development is by no means the abstract social need as the rightists say, but that newspapers obey the development of class struggle, and class struggle is the decisive factor in social development. "Class theory" is the basic law of social development, and it naturally determines the development of one of the social superstructures - newspapers. This law is independent of human will. Whether you recognize this law or not, this law is playing a role. Of course, for the vast majority of readers, not every reader can recognize this law. And this law should be very clear to any "newspaper operator." Every "newspaper operator" is very clear for which class he is working. Whoever tries to reverse this law and turn the newspaper, a weapon of class struggle, into something above class, if he is not intentionally deceiving the world, he will surely be bruised and battered.
    Now, the bourgeois rightists are all united in opposing the Communist Party newspapers and are enthusiastic about the so-called "fellow-traveler newspapers." It is said that there is no freedom of speech in the Party newspapers, and that they want to run "newspapers that are not controlled by the Party and the government." But we want to ask the rightist gentlemen, are these newspapers above class? The logic of history is bound to be: it gets rid of the "control of the Party and the government," but accepts the control of the bourgeoisie; it does not serve socialism, but turns to serve the bourgeoisie. The lesson is not far away, the examples of Wenhui Daily and Guangming Daily are.
    From here, we can also understand how unreasonable the rightists' saying that "newspapers are determined by social needs, not by newspaper operators" is. This "person" certainly does not refer to an individual. An individual cannot determine the development and direction of the newspaper. As soon as Chu Anping arrived at Guangming Daily, he tampered with the political direction of Guangming Daily, and what directed Chu Anping was the bourgeoisie. Therefore, this "person" refers to class and political party. In this respect, as mentioned above, the rightists simply cannot stand. They have not only committed factual errors, but also theoretical errors.
    Marxism believes that social history includes human activities and can only be realized through human activities. The rightists talk about social phenomena by setting aside the activities of people - classes, and regard newspapers as phenomena that can exist independently from people - classes. That is to say, the rightists equate newspapers, a phenomenon full of social and class nature, with natural phenomena, and attempt to describe newspapers as something that is independent of class will, a super-class phenomenon that is close to natural phenomena. This, in theory, falls into the mire of vulgar mechanism.
    As everyone knows, metaphysicians and idealists, when explaining social phenomena, either say that society is something that people's will can freely control, which is of course thorough idealism; or they say that society is the same as biological and physiological phenomena, and is governed by the laws of nature. This theory will inevitably lead to idealism in the end, because it cannot recognize the world according to its true face. The theoretical confusion of the rightists has made them expend a lot of effort, but they have not found what the law of newspaper development is.
    We are not discussing philosophical issues with the rightists here. I am just saying: The rightists are playing with Marxist philosophical terms and polluting the beautiful language of Marxism, the purpose of which is to blur people's understanding of the nature of newspapers, so as to achieve their despicable purpose of usurping the political leadership of newspapers and leading newspapers on the anti-socialist road.
    Our people's, socialist journalists despise the nonsense of the rightists. We do not conceal our position. We do not serve an abstract society, we do not pander to empty "social needs," we only devote our loyalty to the workers, peasants, and laborers and the Communist Party, and fight against the enemies of the people. We openly defend our position because this position is completely consistent with the people's position, is supported by millions of people, and can stand the test of history. Our debate with the rightists on the nature of newspapers is a fierce class struggle, a struggle between two roads: the people's, socialist newspapers and the anti-socialist bourgeois newspapers. This struggle will inevitably end in this way: newspapers with clear socialist ideas will increasingly overcome their shortcomings, become more rich, colorful, lively and powerful, and will be doubly loved by the people. And the anti-socialist, anti-people journalistic ideological wave will not be able to realize their ugly fantasies, and even the trend of thought itself will be washed away by the socialist torrent.

    报纸是阶级斗争的锐利武器
    甘惜分
    资产阶级右派向社会主义报纸发动了激烈的争夺战，企图夺取报纸的政治领导权，至少是首先占领几个“滩头阵地”，然后再组织进攻。右派分子十分清楚：报纸是阶级斗争最尖锐的武器之一。但是，右派分子害怕说出这个严酷的真理。他们千方百计地隐蔽这个真理，而宣传报纸是超阶级、超党派的东西，以达到他们的可耻目的：既然报纸是超阶级超党派的，那么任何人都可以利用它，为什么一定要办社会主义的报纸，而不能办反社会主义的报纸呢？右派分子以为这样就能获得创办所谓“同人报纸”的权利。
    在右派分子之中，并不乏所谓“谋士”，他们从理论上来进攻社会主义报纸。例如中国新闻社的郑白涛就这样声言：“我认为消息应像语言一样，广泛地为社会服务”。这个右派分子从斯大林的“马克思主义与语言学问题”一书里抓取了片言只字，把可以用阶级观念去解释的报纸新闻和不具阶级性的人们交谈所用的语言相提并论，却自命渊博而毫不知羞！
    上海复旦大学新闻系主任、党内右派分子王中更加摆出一张理论家的面孔，装做寻求新闻事业发展规律的姿态，到处贩卖他从西方资产阶级新闻学偷运来的反动新闻学理论。在王中的胡言乱语里，核心思想是所谓“社会需要”论。他认为报纸不是阶级和阶级斗争的产物，而是“社会需要”的产物；报纸是人们自愿出钱买得的“商品”，只有在商品性的基础上才能发挥宣传工具的作用。王中吓唬我们说： “新闻事业有其不以人的意志为转移的规律”，“报纸是一定社会的产物，它决定于社会的需要，而不决定于办报人。”
    你看，王中在这里装得多么像一个科学唯物主义的“理论家”呀！他用“规律”来吓倒人们：你们把报纸作为阶级斗争的工具吗？这就是使报纸“决定于办报人”，这就是违反唯物主义，这就是抗拒不以人的意志为转移的规律！
    可是我们要问一问：什么叫“社会”？右派分子十分高兴在这上面做文章，他们把社会看成是一堆抽象的人群，超阶级的真空。而在我们看来，自从人类产生阶级以来，社会就是经济地位不同的各个集团各个阶级相互制约、相互斗争的场所。右派分子把报纸看成和阶级无关，和社会公用事业电灯、电话、自来水、公共汽车一样普遍为社会服务（这里不能不提醒一句：公用事业本身是没有阶级性的，但在阶级社会里它也不可能普遍为各阶级服务，它属于占有它的阶级）。而在我们看来，报纸不过是表达阶级意识的一种形式，它具有强烈的和鲜明的阶级性。它不属于这个阶级所有，就属于那个阶级所有；它不为这个阶级服务，就为那个阶级服务；它不宣传这个阶级的观点，就宣传那个阶级的观点；它不是为满足抽象的社会需要而产生，而首先是为了满足阶级的特定需要而产生。这才是规律哩！右派先生们，你们为什么畏惧这个规律呢？
    当然，一个粗具常识的人都不会否认报纸的发生和发展需要依赖社会经济、技术、交通和人民文化水平等等条件。——我们和右派的争论并不在这里。我们争论的是：在这样的社会条件之下，是谁推动报纸的发展呢？是抽象的社会？还是一定的阶级力量呢？
    答案本来是明白不过的。
    “邸报”是中国最早的报纸，它所刊载的是“某日皇帝亲耕籍田，行九推礼。某日百僚行大射礼于安福楼南。某日诸蕃君长请扈从封禅。某日皇帝自东封还，赏赐有差。某日宣政门宰相与百僚廷争十刻罢。”（见戈公振著“中国报学史”第二章）这种报纸是为社会服务吗？它不过是宣扬宫廷政令、帝王言行，借以有助于王朝统治而已。这种邸报，自然少不得隐恶扬善。戈公振也说：“故邸报之所得而传录者，仅在习闻习见之事，至于机要大事，则付缺如。专制之下，言禁必严，势也！”可见它并不是什么普遍为社会服务的东西。
    十六、十七世纪首先在地中海沿岸出现的传播商业新闻的机构，促进了近代报纸的产生，看起来它是和阶级斗争相距很远的。但是这些消息供应者也并非服务于什么社会需要，而是服务于新兴资产阶级。资本主义的发展，使资产阶级有获得各地船舶消息、物价消息和政治事件及战争消息的迫切需要。
    法国大革命时期著名的革命领袖马拉所创办的“人民之友”报，不能说它的作用是为“社会”服务的；它发出了彻底摧毁封建制度的战斗号召，它是法国革命的号角，它服务于法国革命的资产阶级和小资产阶级。差不多同一时期，美国独立战争中的报纸也并没有把自己伪装成什么为社会服务的姿态，它一点不隐瞒自己是政治斗争的武器。例如汤姆士·宾的“常识”就这样写道：“亚美利加洲底事业是全人类底事业，啊！你们——谁是爱护人类的，你们——谁是不仅对于专制政体而且对于专制君主敢于反抗的——暴动起来吧！”（“近代史教程”，新华书店1950年版，四十四页）在这里，不仅公开把报纸作为政治斗争的工具，而且在“爱护人类”的口号下，喊出了资产阶级的阶级要求。
    中国的近代印刷报纸首先是由外国帝国主义分子创办的，但是请右派先生们为他们辩护一下吧，说他们办的报纸是应中国的社会需要，而不是服务于帝国主义的目的。
    有谁能拿出有力的证据证明现代西方反动资产阶级报纸是为社会服务的呢？西方资产阶级报纸拥有广大的读者，其中多数是劳动人民，但要把这种现象认为是资产阶级报纸服务社会的表现，未免太可笑了。因为那里的人民只能读到这种资产阶级的东西。资产阶级报纸虽然尽量扩大读者群，那也不过是一方面为了招徕价格昂贵的广告，另方面是更可以扩大资产阶级思想影响的范围。归根到底，它是为资产阶级服务的。
    我们并不隐讳，我们无产阶级报纸服务的对象空前的广大，我们为全体劳动人民服务，但是还不能说我们的报纸是普遍地为社会服务的。我们不为敌视人民的阶级服务，而是利用报纸和它们进行斗争。
    右派分子说：报纸的读者各阶级都有，可见它普遍适应“社会需要”。一万个荒唐！先生，蒋介石也不得不读中国大陆的报纸哩，你大概会说，“人民日报”也适合蒋介石的“需要”，为蒋介石“服务”吧。
    总之，把报纸这一强烈表现阶级意志的工具歪曲成为社会服务的工具，这只能是有意抹煞报纸的阶级性质，而达到逼迫社会主义报纸给右派让出阵地这一卑鄙的目的。斯大林在“马克思主义与语言学问题”一书中，说到上层建筑“以政治、法律、美学和其他的观念替社会服务”，这丝毫不能为右派分子帮忙；从斯大林在该书中的整个思想来看，他说的“替社会服务”，正是为特定的阶级服务的意思。
    现在我们还要从另一个角度来研究这个问题。是否有了所谓“社会需要”就能够产生报纸呢？不是的。报纸的发生和发展除了前面曾经谈到过的社会经济文化条件之外，还要取决于当时的政治条件、政治气候和阶级力量的对比。——这又是右派分子听不进去的。
    鸦片战争以后，惨遭外国侵略和国内反动统治者压迫的中国人民，非常需要报纸来为反帝、反封建服务。但是梁启超、章太炎、孙中山他们创办的适应中国人民需要的进步报纸多次遭到镇压，以致不得不到外国去出版，这是为什么呢？
    中国人民早就需要自己的、彻底站在人民立场发言的报纸了，这种“社会需要”早先并非不存在，但是只有在解放区，特别是在新中国成立之后，人民的报纸才获得自由发展的条件，这又是为什么呢？
    反之，“社会”完全不“需要”的报纸，只要握有统治权力的阶级需要，这种报纸就能到处泛滥。例如国民党的“中央日报”、“扫荡报”、“阵中日报”之类的报纸就是这样。这又是为什么呢？
    这难道不证明报纸决定于社会需要、而不决定于阶级需要这一右派言论，是多么荒谬绝伦！
    但是右派先生们还会继续戴上假面具，非难我们说：“你们犯了唯心主义错误了，你们说报纸的发展决定于阶级斗争的发展，你们就违反了马克思主义的规律不以人的意志为转移这个原理。”
    这个问题未免幼稚。因为报纸发展的规律绝不是如右派所说的抽象的社会需要，而是报纸服从于阶级斗争的发展，阶级斗争是社会发展的决定因素这个历史事实。“阶级论”乃是社会发展的基本规律，它自然也决定了社会上层建筑之一——报纸的发展。这个规律，是不以人的意志为转移的，你认识这个规律也好，你不认识这个规律也好，这个规律都在起作用。当然，对于广大读者来说，并不是每个读者都能认识这个规律。而这个规律对于任何“办报人”来讲，应该是十分明白的，每个“办报人”都十分明白他在为哪个阶级工作。谁要扭转这个规律，把报纸这个阶级斗争的武器变为超阶级的东西，他如果不是有意欺骗世人，也必将碰得头破血流。
    现在资产阶级右派莫不齐心反对共产党党报而热衷于所谓“同人报纸”，据说在党报上没有言论自由，而要办“不受党和政府控制的报纸”。可是我们要问右派先生们，这种报纸难道是超阶级的吗？历史的逻辑必然是：它摆脱了“党和政府的控制”，却接受资产阶级的控制；它不为社会主义服务，而转变为资产阶级服务。殷鉴不远，文汇报和光明日报的例子就是。
    从这里也就可以明白右派所说的“报纸决定于社会的需要，而不决定于办报人”，是怎样地不通。这个“人”，当然不是指个人，个人是不能决定报纸的发展及其方向的，储安平一到光明日报就篡改了光明日报的政治方向，而指挥储安平的是资产阶级。所以这个“人”是指阶级和政党。在这方面来说，如前所述，右派分子就根本站不住脚了。他们不但犯了事实上的错误，而且犯了理论上的错误。
    马克思主义认为社会历史是包括了人的活动的，是只有通过人的活动才能实现的。右派撇开了人——阶级的活动来谈社会现象，把报纸看成可以离开人——阶级而独立存在的现象，这就是说，右派把报纸这一充满了社会性和阶级性的现象和自然界的现象等同起来，企图把报纸说成是不以阶级意志为转移的超阶级的、近乎自然现象的东西，这在理论上就堕入了庸俗机械论的泥坑。
    大家知道，形而上学者和唯心主义者在解释社会现象的时候，要不就把社会说成是人们意志可以自由支配的东西，这当然是彻头彻尾的唯心主义；要不就把社会说成是和生物、生理现象一样的东西，受自然界的规律所支配，这种理论最后也必然归结到唯心主义，因为它不能按照世界的真实面貌来认识世界。右派在理论上的混乱，使他们费了九牛二虎之力，也没有找到报纸发展的规律是什么。
    我们在这里并不是和右派讨论哲学问题，我只是说：右派玩弄马克思主义的哲学词句，沾污了马克思主义的美丽语言，目的不过是模糊人们对报纸性质的认识，以达到他们篡夺报纸政治领导权、使报纸走上反社会主义道路的卑鄙目的。
    我们人民的、社会主义的新闻工作者十分鄙弃右派的胡言乱语，我们不隐讳自己的立场，我们不是为抽象的社会服务，我们不向空洞的“社会需要”献媚，我们只对工农劳动群众和共产党竭尽忠诚，并和人民的敌人进行斗争。我们公开为自己的立场辩护，是因为这个立场和人民立场完全一致，为千百万人民拥护，并经得起历史检验。我们和右派在报纸性质问题上的争论是一场激烈的阶级斗争，是人民的、社会主义的报纸和反社会主义的资产阶级报纸这样两条道路的斗争。这个斗争必将这样结束：具有鲜明社会主义思想的报纸将日益克服自己的缺点，变得更加丰富多采和生动有力，它加倍为人民所喜爱。而反社会主义、反人民的新闻思想浪潮将不可实现它们丑恶的幻想，连这种思潮本身也将被社会主义的激流冲刷得干干净净。
