    First of All...
    Shi Liuming
    In the rectification movement, there are a few comrades like this: when faced with the opinions of the masses, they first nitpick the wording, and when judging the circumstances, they look at the daily behavior of the person offering the opinion.
    When they stand in front of big-character posters or at discussion meetings, and see and hear the masses' criticisms of themselves, the first thought that often pops into their heads is:
    "First of all, this person shouldn't throw around labels..."
    "First of all, there are many discrepancies in the details of the opinion they raised..."
    "First of all, this person is usually frivolous and likes to say strange things, they should look at themselves first..."
    Since there are so many "first of alls," indignation rises, they feel wronged, and think that many opinions are useless.
    In this way, although they have seen many criticisms and heard many opinions, their own erroneous ideology and work style remain largely unchanged.
    If, on the contrary, one first considers the correct and reasonable aspects of the masses' opinions, then one will discover that: although some big-character posters are sharply worded, they do indeed point out shortcomings in one's work; although the person offering the opinion is not without faults themselves, they are "clear-sighted bystanders" and have accurately identified some of one's problems; although some opinions deviate from the facts, they also show that one has not consulted with the masses enough, or has not adequately explained the situation to the masses... these are precisely the areas that should be examined and corrected. If one really looks at the masses' opinions in this way, one will find that the vast majority of opinions sparkle with the wisdom of the masses and are full of the enthusiasm of comrades. These are valuable medicines that are hard to come by, to improve one's ideological level and improve one's work.
    Presumably, no one would regard the flaws in their ideology and work style as treasures, but rather would be willing to overcome shortcomings and willing to improve themselves in this great movement. However, truly overcoming shortcomings cannot rely solely on wishes, but must involve practical actions. To treat the opinions of the masses with a correct attitude is the first action of all practical actions.

    首先是……
    石六鸣
    在整风运动中，有少数这样的同志：他们对待群众的意见，首先是扣字眼，对情节，看提意见人的平日表现。
    他们站在大字报前或者是在座谈会上，看到和听到群众对自己的批评时，第一个涌到脑子里来的念头经常是：
    “首先，这个人不该乱扣帽子……”
    “首先，他提的意见在情节上就有不少出入……”
    “首先，这个人平日就吊而郎当、爱说怪话，他也不先看看自己……”
    既然有了这么多“首先”，于是乎，肝火上升，满腹委屈，觉得许多意见都一无是处。
    这样一来，尽管批评看了许多，意见听了不少，自己的错误思想作风却还是改变无几。
    如果反过来，首先去考虑群众意见的正确部分和合理的地方，那末，就会发现：尽管有些大字报措词尖锐，但是的确指出了自己工作中的缺点；尽管提意见的人平时也不无错处，但他却“旁观者清”，看准了自己的一些毛病；尽管有的意见与事实有所出入，但是也说明了自己平时同群众商量不够，或者没有向群众很好地说明情况……这也正是应该检查纠正的地方。如果真的这样来看待群众的意见，就会发现：绝大多数意见都闪烁着群众的智慧，充满着同志的热情。这都是平日难得的提高思想水平、改进工作的宝贵的药石。
    想来，谁也不会把自己思想作风上的毛病视如珍宝，而是愿意克服缺点，愿意在这个伟大的运动中把自己提高一步。但是，真正要克服缺点，就不能仅凭愿望，而是要有实际行动。以正确的态度对待群众意见，就是一切实际行动中的第一个行动。
