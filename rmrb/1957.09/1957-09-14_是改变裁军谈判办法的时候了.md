It's Time to Change the Approach to Disarmament Negotiations

After nearly six months of fruitless negotiations by the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee in London, it has once again had to submit a report to the United Nations General Assembly stating that no agreement has been reached. Now this issue awaits handling by the upcoming twelfth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Why have disarmament negotiations repeatedly failed for so long? What conclusions should be drawn from these protracted negotiations, and what lessons should be learned?

It has been almost eleven years since the first session of the United Nations General Assembly adopted the resolution on the principles of universal disarmament. It has also been several years since the United Nations General Assembly decided to establish the Disarmament Commission, and later the Disarmament Subcommittee to facilitate its work. During this period, dozens of meetings have been held, many notes exchanged, and countless talks given on the issue of disarmament, but no progress has been made. What is the reason for this? The reason is that the United States and other Western countries have consistently adopted what the Chinese idiom calls a "snake oil salesman" attitude, talking a lot of nonsense but having no real goods.

So why do Western countries adopt this attitude? Because the governments of Western countries are not concerned with disarmament and eliminating the threat of atomic war. On the contrary, they are determined to pursue a policy of expanding armaments and preparing for atomic war. This policy is formulated according to the interests of the monopoly capitalist groups. These monopoly capitalist groups, which determine the major policies of Western governments, endlessly exploit the blood and sweat of the people under the pretext of "national security" in order to obtain the greatest profits; under the pretext of "collective security," they also put a noose around the necks of other countries in order to infiltrate and control these countries. If major powers reach a disarmament agreement, the armaments and military expenditures of all countries will be greatly reduced, the situation will be eased, and the threat of war will be reduced. This would cause the Western monopoly capitalist groups to lose their most lucrative business and loosen their control over the so-called "free world." From this background, it is not surprising that Western countries have never been sincere about disarmament negotiations.

However, some may ask: Haven't Western countries been sitting at the table with the Soviet Union for years to negotiate disarmament? Haven't they put forward various proposals that are said to lay the foundation for negotiations? Yes, they have sat down for negotiations, and they have indeed put forward various plans. But these are far from being out of sincerity, but merely a tactic played under duress.

Today, the international forces for defending peace are unprecedentedly strong, and more and more countries and peoples are calling for disarmament. Under these circumstances, in order to avoid the condemnation of the people of the world, to deceive public opinion, and to shirk the responsibility for obstructing disarmament, the governments of Western countries, which fundamentally do not want disarmament, have had to pretend to be peace-loving and sit down for negotiations, and have constantly put forward various plans.

Unwilling to disarm but having to negotiate disarmament is a fundamental contradiction of Western countries on the issue of disarmament. The reason why Western countries have always adopted a double-dealing approach in the negotiations, on the one hand, singing the high tune of disarmament, and on the other hand, creating various obstacles to disarmament negotiations, lies here.

The so-called "working paper" finally put forward by the United States, representing Western countries in the London negotiations, is a typical "masterpiece" of Western countries playing double-dealing tricks on the issue of disarmament. It contains ulterior and sinister motives. On the one hand, Western countries attempt to obtain certain military strategic advantages under the pretext of solving the disarmament issue, which will help them prepare for and wage new wars. According to the plan in this "document," Western countries themselves will in fact neither reduce their armed forces, withdraw troops stationed abroad, and abolish overseas military bases, nor undertake any practical obligations to prohibit atomic weapons and nuclear tests; at the same time, they want to obtain important military intelligence that their intelligence agencies have failed to obtain through arrangements such as so-called "open skies," "submitting (military) lists," and "peaceful use of outer space," and unilaterally weaken the forces of the peace camp to defend themselves and prevent war. On the other hand, if this goal cannot be achieved, these unacceptable conditions can be used to both bring the negotiations to a standstill and shift the responsibility for the stalemate to the Soviet Union. And they will use this situation as a cover to further expand armaments and prepare for war.

As a result of the lack of sincerity and deliberate obstruction by the United States and other Western countries, the London disarmament negotiations, which lasted for nearly six months, ended in failure. The Western countries' attempt to obstruct a disarmament agreement was successful, but they were politically completely bankrupt. Their true colors of having no intention of reaching any disarmament agreement were completely exposed, making the people of all countries more clearly understand the real reasons hindering disarmament.

Now, American imperialism is stepping up its efforts to promote a policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war centered on nuclear weapons, which poses a serious threat to peace. Therefore, stopping the dangerous arms race and demanding a quick disarmament agreement, especially an agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons, is the urgent desire of all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world. As the upcoming twelfth session of the United Nations General Assembly is about to discuss the issue of disarmament, what all peace-loving and disarmament-concerned countries and peoples should seriously consider is: The history of repeated failures and no achievements in disarmament negotiations for a long time has proved that the existing United Nations General Assembly's disarmament body—the Disarmament Commission and the Subcommittee—cannot complete the sacred task entrusted to them by the United Nations General Assembly due to the irrationality of its composition and negotiation methods. In addition to the Soviet Union, most of the members of the United Nations Disarmament Commission are members of the military bloc headed by the United States, or countries that have military agreements with the United States; as for the subcommittee that actually handles disarmament issues, there are a total of five member states, but except for the Soviet Union, all are major members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the main military bloc in the West preparing for a new war. The composition of this subcommittee is far from reflecting the opinions of all parties in the world. This committee not only excludes other major countries with important relations, but also Asia, Africa, and Latin America, which have the majority of the world's population, have no representatives participating.

The serious weaknesses in the composition and negotiation methods of the United Nations disarmament mechanism give the anti-peace forces an opportunity to obstruct the resolution of the disarmament issue for a long time. The Western member states of the Subcommittee, out of the narrow interests of their military bloc, are fundamentally uninterested in disarmament, so it is impossible to make a real contribution to international disarmament; and the confidential negotiation methods adopted by the Subcommittee so far can only be conducive to Western countries hiding their obstruction of disarmament, avoiding the pressure of world opinion, and are of no benefit to reaching a disarmament agreement.

In view of the urgency of the disarmament issue and the impossibility of the current United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee completing the important task entrusted to it by the United Nations General Assembly, it is time for the United Nations General Assembly to consider changing this institution and adopting new negotiation methods. The Soviet Union has advocated holding a meeting of foreign ministers of the countries concerned, with the participation of chiefs of military staff, to seriously resolve the disarmament issue, and has advocated that disarmament negotiations should be held publicly, with broad participation by representatives from countries on all continents and with various systems. India has also put forward a proposal to the United Nations General Assembly, pointing out that the United Nations Disarmament Commission and the Subcommittee lack sufficient representation geographically and politically, and advocating expanding the membership of these two institutions and giving some countries that can promote understanding and agreement the opportunity to participate in disarmament negotiations. These suggestions and proposals are in line with the current world situation and conform to the universal desire of the people of all countries to urgently demand disarmament. There is no doubt that if the United Nations General Assembly can reorganize the disarmament negotiation mechanism and change the negotiation methods that have proved to be ineffective in accordance with the spirit of these proposals by the Soviet Union and India, it will help to solve this most urgent international issue.

### 是改变裁军谈判办法的时候了

　　是改变裁军谈判办法的时候了
    联合国裁军小组委员会在伦敦举行了将近六个月无结果的谈判之后，不得不又一次向联合国大会提出未曾取得协议的报告。现在这个问题等待着即将开幕的联合国大会第十二届会议来处理。裁军谈判为什么长期以来一再失败呢？从这个旷日持久的谈判中应该作出什么结论并取得怎样的教训呢？
    自从联合国大会第一届会议通过关于普遍裁军的原则决议以来，已经快十一年了。自从联合国大会决定成立裁军委员会，后来为了便于工作，又设立裁军小组委员会以来，也过去了好几年。在这段时间里，关于裁军问题，已经举行过几十次会议，交换过许多照会，发表过无数谈话，但是迄未有一点结果。这倒底是什么原因呢？原因就在于美国和其他西方国家一直采取了中国俗话所说的“卖狗皮膏药”的态度，说得天花乱坠，却并没有真实的货色。
    那么为什么西方国家要采取这种态度呢？因为西方国家的政府所关心的，决不是裁军和消除原子战争的威胁。恰恰相反，它们坚持推行的是扩充军备和准备原子战争的政策。这种政策是按照垄断资本集团的利益制定的。这些决定着西方国家政府大政方针的垄断资本集团，借口为了“国家安全”，无限地压榨老百姓的血汗，从中取得最大的利润；借口为了“集体安全”，给其他国家脖子上也套上了套索，以便对这些国家进行渗入和控制。如果大国之间达成裁军协议，各国的军备和军费就要大量削减，局势就要缓和，战争的威胁就要减少。这就会使西方国家垄断资本集团失去最利市百倍的一项生意，并且松动他们对所谓“自由世界”的控制。从这个背景上来看，西方国家对裁军谈判从来没有诚意，就不足为奇了。
    但是，有人会问：西方国家几年来不是同苏联坐到桌子边上来谈判裁军的么？它们不是曾提出过据说是为谈判奠定基础的种种建议么？不错，它们是坐下来谈判了，并且千准万确地提出过各种方案。但是这些远不是出于什么诚意，而只是在迫不得已的情况下玩的一种策略。
    今天，国际保卫和平的力量空前强大，愈来愈多的国家和人民都发出了要求裁军的呼声。在这种情况下，为了规避全世界人民的谴责，为了蒙蔽舆论并推诿阻挠裁军的责任，根本不愿意裁军的西方国家的政府，不得不装出爱好和平的样子并坐下来谈判，还不断提出了形形色色的方案来。
    不愿意裁军而又不得不谈判裁军，这是西方国家在裁军问题上的一个根本矛盾。西方国家在谈判中一直采用两面派的手法，一面大唱裁军高调，一面又给裁军谈判制造种种障碍，其原因就在这里。
    美国代表西方国家在伦敦谈判中最后提出来的所谓“工作文件”，是西方国家在裁军问题上玩弄两面手法的典型“杰作”。它包藏着不可告人的阴险目的。一方面，西方国家企图借口解决裁军问题，取得某些军事战略方面的利益，有助于它们准备和进行新战争。按照这个“文件”的规划，西方国家自己将实际上既不裁减武装部队、撤退驻外国的军队和撤消国外军事基地，又不承担任何禁止原子武器和核试验的切实义务；同时，它们却想通过所谓“开放天空”，“提出
  （军备）清单”以及“和平利用外空”之类的安排，来取得它们谍报机关所未能取得的重要军事情报，并单方面削弱和平阵营进行自卫和制止战争的力量。另一方面，如果这个目的不能达到，那就可以利用这些无法接受的条件，既使谈判陷入僵局，又把谈判陷入僵局的责任推到苏联身上。而它们就利用这种局面作为掩护，来进一步扩军备战。
    由于美国和其他西方国家的毫无诚意和蓄意阻挠的结果，经过将近六个月的伦敦裁军谈判以失败而告终了。西方国家阻挠裁军协议的企图成功了，但是它们在政治上完全破产了。它们根本无意于达成任何裁军协议的面目彻底暴露了，从而使得各国人民更加清楚地了解了阻碍裁军的真正原因。
    现在，美帝国主义正在加紧推行以核子武器为中心的扩军备战政策，使和平受到了严重的威胁。因此，制止危险的军备竞赛，要求迅速达成裁军协议，特别是就禁止原子武器达成协议，是全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的迫切愿望。在开幕在即的第十二届联合国大会将要讨论裁军问题的时候，值得所有爱好和平和关心裁军的国家和人民认真考虑的问题是：裁军谈判长期以来多次失败、一事无成的历史已经证明，现有的联合国大会处理裁军问题的机构——裁军委员会和小组委员会，由于组成和谈判方法的不合理，不可能完成联合国大会所交托给它们的神圣任务。联合国裁军委员会中除苏联一国以外，大部分都是以美国为首的军事集团的成员，或者是同美国订有军事协定的国家；至于实际处理裁军问题的小组委员会，一共五个成员国，但是除苏联以外，都是西方准备新战争的主要军事集团北大西洋公约组织的主要成员。这个小组委员会的组成，远不能反映世界各方面的意见。这个委员会不仅把另外一些有重要关系的大国排斥在外，而且拥有世界人口大部分的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，也没有一个代表参加。
    联合国裁军机构这种组成方法和谈判方式上的重大弱点，使反和平势力有机可乘，长期阻挠裁军问题的解决。小组委员会的西方成员国，出于它们军事集团的狭隘利益，对裁军根本不感兴趣，因此不可能对国际裁军作出真正的贡献；而小组委员会迄今所采取的秘密谈判的方式，只能有利于西方国家隐藏它们阻挠裁军的事实，避开世界舆论的压力，对达成裁军协议也毫无好处。
    鉴于裁军问题的紧迫性和现在的联合国裁军小组委员会不可能完成联合国大会委托给它的重大任务，由联合国大会考虑改变这个机构并采取新的谈判方法，应该是时候了。苏联曾经主张举行有关国家的外长级会议，在军事参谋部首长的参加下来认真解决裁军问题，并主张裁军谈判应当公开举行，广泛吸收各洲、各种制度的国家的代表参加讨论。印度也向联合国大会提出了建议，指出联合国裁军委员会和小组委员会在地理上和政治条件上都缺乏充分的代表性，主张扩大这两个机构的成员，并使得一些能够促进谅解和协议的国家有机会参与裁军问题的谈判。这些建议和主张，都是适应当前世界的形势，符合于各国人民急切要求裁军的普遍愿望的。毫无疑问，联合国大会如果能够按照苏联和印度这些主张的精神，改组裁军谈判机构，改变已经证明无效的谈判方法，将会有助于这个当前最迫切的国际问题的解决。
