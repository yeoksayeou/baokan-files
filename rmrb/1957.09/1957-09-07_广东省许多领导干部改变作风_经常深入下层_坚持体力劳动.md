Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou—Since the provincial-level Party and government directly affiliated organs in Guangdong Province implemented the spirit of rectification while correcting mistakes, the work style of many leading cadres has improved.

Most leading cadres of various departments of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee have persisted in spending two and a half days a month participating in physical labor at construction sites and agricultural cooperatives, strengthening their direct contact with workers and peasant masses. The Chief Procurator of the Guangdong Provincial Procuratorate has personally handled more than 400 letters from the people, and the Chief Procurator and Deputy Chief Procurators also receive visiting masses every Thursday afternoon. The leading cadres of the Provincial Department of Water Resources have decided to hold a symposium with members of democratic parties once a month to specifically listen to their opinions. Many units' leading cadres have also formulated specific methods to strengthen collective leadership and improve the meeting system, initially changing the phenomenon of insufficient communication between superiors and subordinates and between Party members and non-Party members in the past.

Many units have also improved the work related to the welfare of cadres and the masses.

    经常深入下层  坚持体力劳动
    据新华社广州讯　广东省省级党、政直属机关贯彻边整边改精神后，许多领导干部的作风已有改进。
    中共广东省委各部大多数领导干部，都坚持每月以两天半时间到工地、农业社参加体力劳动，加强了跟工人、农民群众的直接联系。广东省检察院检察长已亲自处理了四百多件人民来信，正副检察长还在每星期四下午接见来访的群众。省水利厅的领导干部已决定每月召开一次民主党派成员的座谈会，专门听取他们的意见。不少单位的领导干部，在加强集体领导、健全会议制度方面也定出具体的办法，初步改变了过去上下级之间和党内外之间联系不够密切的现象。
    许多单位还改进了干部、群众生活福利方面的工作。
