Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 7th. The call to "Save grain and manage the household diligently" has been met with enthusiastic response in the rural areas of Shandong Province.

    The Huimin Special District has launched a campaign for each household to save one tael of grain per day and collect fifty catties of dried vegetables. Many farmers have drawn up plans to save grain and eat more coarse grains and substitutes. Wild green beans and wild finger millet in coastal areas such as Guangrao and Lijin are being collected and eaten by farmers, which is estimated to save 70 to 80 million catties of grain. Some counties in this special district have withdrawn their original requests to increase the grain procurement quota. In Zhucheng County, Changwei Special District, 308 agricultural cooperatives have returned 826,000 catties of grain that should not have been supplied to the state. Farmers in the disaster areas of Heze, Jining, Linyi and other special districts have also voluntarily lowered their grain rations in accordance with the spirit of eating according to the year's harvest and wearing clothes according to the year's production, in order to reduce the state's grain supply.

    山东农民热烈响应节约用粮的号召
    新华社济南7日电 “节约用粮，勤俭持家”的号召，在山东省农村中得到了热烈的响应。
    惠民专区已经开展每户每天节约一两粮、每户采集干菜五十斤的运动。不少农户订出节约用粮计划，多吃粗粮和代食品。广饶、利津沿海一带的野绿豆、野穇子等，被农民收藏食用，估计可以节约粮食七、八千万斤。这个专区的一些县原来提出的增加粮食统销指标的要求，现在已经撤销。昌潍专区诸城县有三百零八个农业社，把不应该供应的八十二万六千斤粮食退还给了国家。灾区菏泽、济宁、临沂等专区的农民，也根据随年吃饭、随年穿衣的精神，自动降低口粮标准，以减少国家的粮食供应量。
