Timely Warning
By a Commentator of this newspaper

　　Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko issued a stern warning to the American aggressor bloc on the 10th, demanding that the United States cease its conspiracies to disrupt peace and interfere in Syria in the Middle East. Gromyko stated that the Soviet Union could not remain indifferent to threats to peace in the Middle East. Gromyko's remarks are a timely warning from the Soviet government and people to the arrogant American aggressors, and also a powerful support for the Syrian people who are fighting against aggression and defending their independence. The Soviet government's solemn position of opposing aggression, maintaining peace, and upholding justice once again proves that the Soviet Union is a staunch defender of world peace and a reliable and selfless friend of all people struggling to win and defend their independence. We, the Chinese people, fully support the Soviet government's position.
　　The American aggressor bloc has always harbored a gambler's侥幸 mind, believing that it can unscrupulously carry out aggression against Syria. The American "New York Times" openly admitted that the current American actions of aggression against Syria are "a gamble." However, the attitude of the Soviet government should sober up the heads of the American aggressor bloc and realize that this is a "gamble" destined to be lost. If the United States is obdurate and continues to take aggressive actions against Syria, then the United States will not be able to escape the responsibility for undermining peace in the Middle East and the world, and will suffer heavier blows and more shameful failures than the British and French aggression against Egypt.
　　At the same time as Foreign Minister Gromyko issued a warning to the United States, the American conspiracy to invade Syria is continuing to unfold according to predetermined steps. The main part of the U.S. Sixth Fleet has entered the eastern part of the central Mediterranean under the pretext of participating in the North Atlantic Group naval exercises. American warships and aircraft have already appeared off the Syrian coast. This so-called "show of force" is, on the one hand, intimidating Syria and, on the other hand, cheering up Turkey. Turkish troops have already concentrated on the Syrian-Turkish border. However, with the powerful Soviet Union to the north, determined to maintain peace in the Middle East, the Turkish ruling group cannot but be apprehensive when carrying out American instructions. The U.S. Sixth Fleet's arrival near Turkey is clearly an attempt to stabilize the hesitant mood of the Turkish ruling group.
　　To the south of Syria, Israeli troops have moved towards the Israeli-Syrian border and launched armed provocations. As the American conspiracy progresses, Israel, as an American tool of aggression, will undoubtedly intensify the tension on the Israeli-Syrian border, and even carry out armed attacks, in order to contain Syria's military power, facilitate American subversive activities within Syria, and allow pro-American Arab countries to use the excuse of jointly dealing with Israel to send troops to invade Syria. These countries are now receiving reinforcements of large quantities of American weapons. In addition to Jordan, it has been confirmed that countries such as Iraq and Turkey have received or will receive American weapons and equipment, including jet fighters. Dulles said at a press conference on the 10th that these weapons would not be used against Israel, which precisely proves that they will be used against Syria.
　　Dulles also wanted to create a smokescreen to conceal America's blatant preparations for aggression against Syria. He hypocritically said that the United States has not yet determined whether the Syrian issue falls within the scope of the "Eisenhower Doctrine." However, the statements issued by Dulles after consulting with Eisenhower on the Syrian issue, as well as America's actual actions in the Middle East, expose the utter hypocrisy of Dulles' statement.
　　The American conspiracy to invade Syria is proceeding step by step. However, the Syrian people, facing the threat of aggression, are prepared to give the invaders a merciless rebuff. Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar stated on the 10th that no American threat can frighten Syria. Syria is prepared to deal with all contingencies and face any aggression. This is the determination of the Syrian people. And Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko's warning to the United States represents the will of peace-loving people all over the world. In today's world, where the forces of peace are unprecedentedly strong, if the United States does not stop its aggression against Syria, its claws will surely be cut off.

　　及时的警告
　　本报评论员
    苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在10日对美国侵略集团提出了严厉的警告，要美国停止在中东破坏和平、干涉叙利亚的阴谋。葛罗米柯申明，苏联对于中东地区的和平遭到威胁不能置之不理。葛罗米柯的这一谈话，是苏联政府和人民对气焰嚣张的美国侵略者的一个及时的警告，同时也是对正在为反对侵略、保卫独立而斗争的叙利亚人民的强有力的支持。苏联政府这种反对侵略、维护和平、坚持正义的严正立场，再次证明了苏联是世界和平的坚决的捍卫者，是一切为争取和保卫独立而奋斗的人民的可以信赖的无私的朋友。我们中国人民完全支持苏联政府的立场。
    美国侵略集团一直怀着赌棍一样的侥幸心理，以为它可以无所顾忌地对叙利亚实行侵略。美国的“纽约时报”公开把美国目前所采取的侵略叙利亚的行动承认为是“一次赌博”。但是，苏联政府的态度应该可以使美国侵略集团的头脑清醒过来，认识到这是一场注定了要输掉的“赌博”。如果美国执迷不悟，继续采取侵略叙利亚的行动，那末美国将不能逃避破坏中东和世界和平的责任，并使自己遭到比侵略埃及的英、法更沉重的打击和更可耻的失败。
    就在葛罗米柯外长对美国发出警告的同时，美国侵略叙利亚的阴谋正在继续按照预定的步骤展开。美国第六舰队的主要部分在参加北大西洋集团海军演习的借口下，进入了中地中海的东部。美国军舰和飞机已经在叙利亚海岸出现。这种所谓“显示实力”的行动，一方面是恫吓叙利亚，另一方面是替土耳其打气。土耳其军队已经在叙、土边境集中。但是由于北面有着决心维护中东和平的强大的苏联，土耳其统治集团在执行美国指示的时候不能不有所顾忌。美国第六舰队开到土耳其附近，显然是企图稳定土耳其统治集团的犹豫不安的情绪。
    在叙利亚的南面，以色列的军队已经向以、叙边境移动，并且发动了武装挑衅。随着美国阴谋的推进，作为美国侵略工具的以色列，无疑将加剧以、叙边境上的紧张局势，甚至实行武装进攻，以箝制叙利亚的军事力量，便于美国在叙利亚内部进行颠覆活动，并使亲美的阿拉伯国家可以用共同对付以色列为借口，派兵侵入叙利亚。这些国家现在正在得到大批美国武器的增援。除了约旦以外，已经证实，伊拉克和土耳其等国都得到了或者将要得到包括喷气战斗机在内的美国武器和装备。杜勒斯在10日记者招待会上说，这些武器不会用来对付以色列，这恰恰证明它们将被用来对付叙利亚。
    杜勒斯还想施放烟幕，来遮掩美国对叙利亚的露骨的侵略准备。他假惺惺地说，美国还没有确定叙利亚问题是否属于“艾森豪威尔主义”的范围。但是杜勒斯在同艾森豪威尔就叙利亚问题会商以后发表的声明，以及美国在中东的实际行动，都揭穿了杜勒斯这种说法的彻底虚伪。
    美国侵略叙利亚的阴谋正在着着进行。但是，面临侵略威胁的叙利亚人民，已准备好给侵略者以无情回击。叙利亚外交部长比塔尔在10日表示，美国的任何威胁都吓不倒叙利亚。叙利亚准备对付一切事变，面对任何侵略。这是叙利亚人民的决心。而苏联葛罗米柯外长对美国的警告，代表了全世界爱好和平的人民的意志。在世界和平力量空前壮大的今天，如果美国不停止侵略叙利亚的行动，它的魔爪一定将被斩断。
