Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, September 4th. At the sixth session of the First People's Congress of Hebei Province, which closed on September 1st, more than 500 people's representatives and attendees launched a reasoning struggle against the right-wing elements among the representatives. After being exposed and criticized by the representatives, the right-wing elements had no choice but to surrender and confess their crimes. Many representatives who had previously held a neutral attitude towards the anti-rightist struggle also actively participated in this struggle.

These right-wing elements are: Dai Lianjiang, president of the affiliated hospital of Hebei Medical College; Chen Di'an, deputy secretary-general of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPPCC; Wang Junyan, vice chairman of the Zhangjiakou Municipal Committee of the CPPCC; and Gao Zhensheng, Liu Zhucun, and Xu Yunshan, deputy chairmen of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce. These people are all backbone right-wing elements in Hebei Province. It was revealed that although Chen Di'an had never studied water conservancy issues, he completely denied the great achievements of Hebei Province's water management over the years, saying that the government allowed the people to "wait helplessly to be submerged," thereby trying to provoke the unity of the people with the Communist Party and the government. Xu Yunshan denied that fixed interest was exploitation, saying that the bourgeoisie had no dual nature. In order to become the deputy mayor of Handan City, he also organized a small group to raise his political status. The right-wing element Gao Zhensheng particularly appreciated the reactionary remarks of Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi and others, and claimed to be a "hardliner" in attacking the Communist Party. Liu Zhucun spread Zhang Naiqi's fallacy of "red bourgeoisie" in order to deny the leadership of the Communist Party and deny the necessity of transforming the bourgeoisie. The right-wing element Dai Lianjiang used despicable means to exclude Communist Party members and Communist Youth League cadres in the hospital, wanting to turn the affiliated hospital into his "independent kingdom." He acted arbitrarily, but said that he "had the title but no power."

At the meeting, representatives from various regions used irrefutable facts to carry out a reasoning struggle against the right-wing elements.

    河北省人民代表坚持说理斗争
    右派分子一个个缴械投降
    据新华社保定4日电　在9月1日闭幕的河北省第一届人民代表大会第六次会议上，五百多名人民代表和列席人员向代表中间的右派分子展开了说理斗争。右派分子经过代表们的揭露和批判，不得不缴械投降，低头认罪。许多原先对反右派斗争抱中间态度的代表，也积极参加了这一斗争。
    这些右派分子是：河北医学院附属医院院长戴练江，政协河北省委员会副秘书长陈迪庵，政协张家口市委员会副主席王君彦，河北省工商联副主任委员高振声、刘竹村和许蕴珊。这些人都是河北省右派骨干分子。据揭露，陈迪庵虽然从来没有研究过水利问题，却一口否定河北省历年来治水的伟大成绩，说政府让人民“束手待毙，听候淹没”，借此来挑拨人民同共产党和政府的团结。许蕴珊否定定息是剥削，说资产阶级没有两面性。为了想做邯郸市副市长，他还组织小集团来提高自己的政治地位。右派分子高振声特别欣赏章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器等人的反动言论，且自称是向共产党进攻的“硬手”。刘竹村散布章乃器“红色资产阶级”的谬论，以此来否定共产党的领导，否定资产阶级进行改造的必要性。右派分子戴练江用卑鄙手段排斥医院里的共产党员和共青团员干部，想把附属医院变成他的“独立王国”，他独断专行，却说自己“有职无权”。
    会上，各地代表以无可辩驳的事实，对右派分子进行了说理斗争。
