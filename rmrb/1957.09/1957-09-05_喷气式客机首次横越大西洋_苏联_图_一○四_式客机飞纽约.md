    First Jet Airliner Crosses the Atlantic
    Soviet "Tu-104" Flies to New York
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th - A Soviet "Tu-104" jet airliner flew from Moscow across the Atlantic to New York today, making a long-distance transatlantic voyage of nine thousand kilometers. This is the first time in history that a jet airliner has flown across the Atlantic.
    The plane took off from Moscow at six o'clock this morning and will make intermediate stops in London, Iceland, and Goose Bay in Canada before flying to New York. The entire journey will take seventeen hours and forty minutes, of which only twelve hours will be spent in the air. The maximum flight altitude will be 13,000 meters, and the speed will be 900 kilometers per hour.
    According to personnel from the Soviet Civil Aviation Administration, the weather conditions over the Atlantic are currently very complex. There are currently very strong air currents over Iceland and the Greenland Strait, and there are also winds of 100 kilometers per hour in the flight area. During this flight, the aircraft will be piloted by experienced Soviet jet pilots. After the aircraft lands in Canada, an American navigator will board to guide the flight.
    Currently, the United States does not have jet airliners. According to newspaper reports, the news of the Soviet jet airliner flying to New York has aroused great interest among the American public.

    喷气式客机首次横越大西洋
    苏联“图—一○四”式客机飞纽约
    据新华社莫斯科4日电　一架苏联“图—一○四”喷气式客机今天从莫斯科横越大西洋飞往纽约，作一次长达九千公里的远洋航行。有史以来喷气式客机飞越大西洋，这还是第一次。
    这架飞机在今天早上六点从莫斯科起飞，它将在伦敦、冰岛和加拿大的鹅湾三处作中途停息，然后飞往纽约。全部航程共需十七时四十分，其中空中飞行时间只要十二时，飞行高度最高将达一万三千公尺，时速为九百公里。
    据苏联民用航空管理局的人员说，现在大西洋上空气候情况很复杂，在冰岛和格陵兰海峡区域的上空目前有着很强大的气流，此外在飞行地区还有时速一百公里的大风。在这次飞行中，飞机将由富有经验的苏联喷气机驾驶员驾驶，飞机在加拿大着陆后，将由美国领航员上机领航。
    目前，美国还没有喷气式客机。据报纸消息，苏联喷气客机将飞纽约消息在美国公众中引起极大的兴趣。
