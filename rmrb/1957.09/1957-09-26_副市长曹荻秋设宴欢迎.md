Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 24th. Indian Vice President Radhakrishnan said at a welcoming banquet hosted by Shanghai Vice Mayor Cao Diqiu tonight: I hope Shanghai has a great future, and I hope China has a great future. Through China, the entire Asia and the world will have a bright future.

The Indian Vice President then said: Common goals and aspirations connect us together. This visit has made me realize how much work you have done since liberation. You are now the masters of your own territory, free from foreign interference. India, like you, gained independence ten years ago and is still engaged in social and economic construction.

Before Vice President Radhakrishnan spoke, Cao Diqiu, on behalf of the seven million people of Shanghai, expressed a warm welcome to the distinguished guests for visiting Shanghai.
