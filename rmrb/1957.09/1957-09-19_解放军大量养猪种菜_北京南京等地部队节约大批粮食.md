　　The People's Liberation Army Massively Raises Pigs and Grows Vegetables
　　Troops in Beijing, Nanjing, and Other Places Save Large Amounts of Grain
    (Report from this newspaper) The People's Liberation Army (PLA) units, organs, and schools, under the principle of not affecting training and not competing with the people for profit, have vigorously carried out production activities such as pig raising and vegetable growing. It is estimated that this year they can produce 200 million catties of vegetables and 10 million catties of pork.
    According to incomplete statistics from the Nanjing, Guangzhou, Shenyang, and Beijing Military Regions, more than 60,000 pigs were raised and more than 17 million catties of vegetables were produced in the first half of this year. Troops stationed in Guangzhou also raised nearly 20,000 cattle, sheep, and poultry, and more than 359,000 fish. Many units also planted sunflowers and various fruit trees according to local conditions.
    Many units have now achieved mostly or entirely self-sufficiency in vegetables; meat has also reached 3% to 8% self-sufficiency, and individual units have achieved complete self-sufficiency. This has not only reduced the market's supply burden to the troops, but has also greatly improved the troops' living standards.
    Troops stationed on the frontiers and islands, due to the difficulty of transporting non-staple foods, have proposed striving for self-sufficiency in meat and vegetable production. Naval troops stationed on islands, under difficult production conditions, planted grain, vegetables, sweet potatoes, and fruit trees, and also raised many pigs, sheep, fish, and poultry. Most islands in the Zhoushan area lack water sources. The troops stationed on the islands plant leafy vegetables during the rainy season and root vegetables during the dry season to adapt to the drought season.
    The PLA officers and soldiers have very high production enthusiasm. They make full use of all available time, such as seizing the gaps after morning exercises and after dinner to go to the fields for production. The families of officers also actively participate in production activities.
    Xinhua News Agency report: Troops in Beijing, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou and other regions have saved a lot of grain.
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Beijing have saved more than 1.63 million catties of grain in a recent period. Leaders at all levels of the troops attach great importance to grain conservation. Some units have opened "Grain Conservation Exhibitions" to publicize the importance of conservation to the vast number of officers and soldiers. A certain unit conducted education among officers and soldiers on saving one or two liang of rice per person per day to support the people in the disaster areas, calling on everyone to share weal and woe with the people in the disaster areas. When a certain unit transported grain, the truck drivers picked up every grain of grain that was spilled on the ground. Some units installed cloth pockets around the kneading table, set up wooden boards between the kneading board and the fermentation tank, and installed a fine gauze bottom in the rice washing pool to prevent the loss of rice and flour.
    Troops in the Nanjing area have saved more than 3.99 million catties of grain this year. Many units of the garrison in this area have achieved accurate application for grain, careful storage, rationing according to population, and everyone cherishing food in terms of grain conservation. The cooks in some units achieved "four cleanups" - emptying rice and flour bags, sweeping the kitchen floor, cleaning pots and pans, and cleaning rice washing baskets; all personnel achieved "three cleanups" when eating - clean bowls, clean tables, and clean floors; not a single grain of rice was dropped, and no food was spilled. In order to prevent the grain in the warehouse from getting damp, moth-eaten, or bitten by rats, a certain unit stationed on the island adopted methods such as raising the floor for ventilation, eating old grain and storing new grain, and having special personnel to take care of the grain to protect the grain from loss.
    Troops in the Wuhan area have also saved 1.49 million catties of grain recently. In the second quarter of this year, the Guangzhou troops turned over 660,000 catties of grain saved by the vast number of officers and soldiers within the supply standard to the state.

　　解放军大量养猪种菜
　　言北京南京等地部队节约大批粮食
    本报讯　解放军各部队、机关、学校在不影响训练和不与民争利的原则下，大力开展了养猪、种菜等生产活动，预计今年可生产蔬菜两亿斤，猪肉一千万斤。
    根据南京、广州、沈阳、北京部队的不完全统计，今年上半年共养猪六万余口，生产蔬菜一千七百余万斤。驻广州部队还养牛、羊和家禽近两万只，养鱼三十五万九千余条。许多单位还根据驻地情况，种植了向日葵和各种果树。
    现有不少单位已做到了蔬菜大部分自给或全部自给；肉类也达到了自给3％至8％，个别单位达到了全部自给。这样不仅减少了市场对部队的供应，而且大大改善了部队的生活。
    驻在边防、海岛的部队，由于副食品运输困难，都提出争取肉类、蔬菜生产自给。海军驻岛屿部队，在生产条件困难的情况下，种植了粮食、蔬菜、地瓜、果树，还饲养了许多猪、羊、鱼和家禽。舟山地区多数岛屿缺乏水源，驻岛部队在雨季就多种叶菜，旱季则多种根茎菜，以适应干旱季节。
    解放军官兵们的生产情绪很高，他们充分利用了一切可以利用的时间，如抓紧早操、晚饭后的空隙时间下地生产。军官家属，也积极参加了生产活动。
    新华社讯　北京、南京、武汉、广州等地区部队已经节约了大量的粮食。
    中国人民解放军驻北京部队，在最近一个时期中，节约粮食一百六十三万多斤。部队各级领导十分重视粮食节约，有的单位开办了“节约粮食展览会”，对广大官兵进行了宣传。某部队在官兵中进行了每人每日节约一两米支援灾区人民的教育，号召大家跟灾区人民同甘共苦。某部运粮时，大车驾驶手将洒在地上的粮食一粒粒地拣起来。有的单位在面案周围装上布兜，案板和发面缸之间搭上木板，淘米池内装上细纱罗底，防止米面撒失漏掉。
    南京地区部队今年已节约粮食三百九十九万多斤。这个地区驻军的许多单位在节约粮食方面，做到了申请领粮数字准确，认真保管，计口下粮，人人爱惜。有些单位的炊事人员做到“四光”——米面袋子倒光，厨房地上扫光，锅碗瓢盆刷光，淘米筐子清光；就餐时全体人员做到“三净”——碗净、桌净、地上净；不掉一粒米，不撒半点饭。驻在海岛的某部队，为了防止仓库的粮食受潮和虫蛀鼠咬，采用垫高通风、吃陈储新、专人看管等办法，保护粮食不受损失。
    武汉地区部队在最近也节约粮食一百四十九万斤。广州部队在今年第二季度，将广大官兵在供给标准以内节余下来的六十六万斤粮食上缴国家。
