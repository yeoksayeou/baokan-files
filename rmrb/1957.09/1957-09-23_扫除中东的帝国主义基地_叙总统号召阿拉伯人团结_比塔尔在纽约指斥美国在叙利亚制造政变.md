    Sweep Away Imperialist Bases in the Middle East
    Syrian President Calls on Arabs to Unite
    Bitar in New York Accuses the US of Orchestrating a Coup in Syria
    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, September 22nd: Syrian President Kuwatli, while presiding over the opening ceremony of the Third Arab Lawyers Conference here on the 21st, once again called on all Arabs to strive for Arab unity in order to eliminate and weaken the imperialist bases in the Middle East. He also called for the formulation of unified laws as the basis for all-encompassing unity.
    Kuwatli strongly condemned the policies of Western countries. He said, "They have consistently insisted on blockading us, sometimes surrounding us with fabricated rumors and exaggerated claims, and sometimes surrounding us with land and naval forces. We have often refuted these fabricated lies, but they are meticulously devoted to their conspiracies according to carefully devised plans."
    Referring to the Gulf of Aqaba issue, Kuwatli said: Dulles said that the Gulf of Aqaba issue falls within the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, but beforehand he said that Israel has the right to pass through the Gulf of Aqaba, thus showing the world that American-style justice is to impose pre-prepared decisions on the International Court of Justice.
    Kuwatli said that the issues of Palestine, the Suez Canal, the Gulf of Aqaba, Algeria, Yemen, and Oman are issues of justice and fairness. Imperialism is making demands for their own vested rights and permanent interests.
    Kuwatli concluded by saying: Fabricated rumors and exaggerations cannot change our attitude, and large numbers of troops and ships can never shake our determination to defend our rights.
    More than two thousand people are participating in the conference, including eight hundred representatives and lawyers from Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Libya, and Tunisia. The conference will last for five days.
    When the heads of the various delegations delivered speeches, they condemned the Eisenhower Doctrine, the Baghdad Pact, and the newly planned imperialist conspiracies against Syria.
    Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd: New York News: Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar arrived in New York on the 21st to attend the United Nations General Assembly. At the airport, he stated to reporters that US diplomatic officials in Syria "attempted to influence certain Syrian officers to stage a coup," which is one of the reasons for the deterioration of relations between Syria and the United States.
    Bitar refuted the slander of so-called Soviet interference in Syria, saying, "A Western country is carrying out aggression in Algeria. Another Western country is carrying out aggression in Oman and Yemen." Bitar also accused the United States of supporting Israel.

    扫除中东的帝国主义基地
    叙总统号召阿拉伯人团结
    比塔尔在纽约指斥美国在叙利亚制造政变
    据新华社大马士革22日电　叙利亚总统库阿特利21日在这里主持第三届阿拉伯律师代表大会的开幕仪式时，再一次号召一切阿拉伯人为阿拉伯的团结而努力，以便扫除和削弱中东地区的帝国主义基地。他还要求制定统一的法律作为无所不包的团结的基础。
    库阿特利强烈地谴责西方国家的政策。他说：“它们一直坚持封锁我们，有时用无中生有的谣言和夸大的说法来包围我们，有时用陆军部队和海军部队来包围我们。我们经常反驳这些无中生有的谰言，但是它们却按照仔细拟订的计划专心致志于它们的阴谋活动。”
    谈到亚喀巴湾问题，库阿特利说：杜勒斯说，亚喀巴湾问题是属于国际法院职权范围内的事情，但是事先他却说，以色列有权通过亚喀巴湾，这样就向全世界表明，美国式的公正就是向国际法庭强加预先拟好的决定。
    库阿特利说，巴勒斯坦、苏伊士运河、亚喀巴湾、阿尔及利亚、也门和阿曼问题是正义和公道的问题。帝国主义是为了它们自己的既得权利和永久利益提出要求的。
    库阿特利最后说：捏造的谣言和夸张不能够改变我们的态度，大批的军队和舰只决不能动摇我们致力于保卫我们的权利的决心。
    参加大会的有两千多人，其中包括叙利亚、黎巴嫩、伊拉克、利比亚和突尼斯的八百名代表和律师，大会将举行五天。
    各代表团团长发表演说时，谴责艾森豪威尔主义、巴格达条约和帝国主义新策划的反对叙利亚的阴谋。
    据新华社22日讯　纽约消息：叙利亚外交部长比塔尔21日到达纽约参加联合国大会，他在机场上向记者发表声明说，美国驻叙利亚的外交官员“企图影响某些叙利亚军官搞政变”，这是叙利亚同美国关系恶化的原因之一。
    比塔尔驳斥所谓苏联干涉叙利亚的谰言，他说，“一个西方国家正在阿尔及利亚进行侵略。另外也是一个西方国家正在阿曼和也门进行侵略”。比塔尔还指责美国支持以色列。
