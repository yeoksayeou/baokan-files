    World Peace Forces Unite Again
    Cai Tingkai Reports to Three Organizations Including the World Association for Peace on the World Conference Against Hydrogen Bombs
    Xinhua News Agency, 6th – Cai Tingkai said that the Third World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, held in Tokyo, Japan, was a successful conference with significant gains. The consensus reached by representatives from various countries on various issues demonstrates another great unity of world peace forces and the increasing consolidation of this unity.
    Cai Tingkai, who led the Chinese delegation to the conference, reported on the conference proceedings at a joint meeting held tonight by three Chinese organizations: the Chinese Preparatory Committee for the Third World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and the Chinese Asian Solidarity Committee.
  The meeting was presided over by Guo Moruo, and attendees included Chen Shutong, Li Dequan, Shao Lizi, Li Zhuchen, Zhu Xuefan, Liu Ningyi, Liu Geping, Chen Hansheng, Chen Qiyou, Xie Xuehong, Xu Baoju, Xiao San, and many others.
    In his report, Cai Tingkai said that the Third World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament lasted for eleven days. A total of ninety-seven representatives from twenty-five countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, America, and Australia, and ten international organizations, as well as three thousand nine hundred and eighty-one representatives from various Japanese mass organizations and local communities, and several thousand observers participated in the conference. At the plenary session on August 16, the final day of the conference, participants unanimously adopted the three formal documents of the conference: the "Tokyo Declaration," the "Appeal to the United Nations and Governments of All Countries," and the "Proposal for Joint Action to Prohibit Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament."
    Cai Tingkai said that the Chinese delegation, adhering to the peaceful will of the 600 million people of the country and our country's peaceful policies, earnestly and actively participated in various meetings of the conference, sincerely exchanged views with friends from all over the world, and, in the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences, worked with representatives from various countries to make various resolutions of the conference.
    Cai Tingkai said that the conference was very fruitful. Representatives from various countries and from Japan reached a consensus on issues such as demanding an immediate halt to nuclear weapons testing, prohibiting the manufacture, stockpiling, and use of nuclear weapons, demanding universal disarmament, and opposing the establishment and expansion of military bases on the territory of other countries, demonstrating another great unity of world peace forces and the increasing consolidation of this unity. The three documents unanimously adopted by the conference more clearly pointed out the direction of struggle for peace-loving people around the world. The joint declaration issued by representatives of Asian and African countries after the conference voiced the common voice of the people of this region and reflected their united and enormous strength. They also called for an Asian-African conference as early as possible, similar to the Asian countries' conference held in New Delhi, the capital of India, in April 1955. Egyptian friends have indicated that this conference could be held in Cairo, possibly in the autumn or early winter of this year.
    Zhao Puchu, deputy head of the Chinese delegation to the Third World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, gave a supplementary report. Zhao Puchu also read a letter from the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs thanking the six Chinese organizations for donating funds to express sympathy to Japanese victims of atomic and nuclear weapons.
    At the meeting, Guo Moruo, Li Dequan, and Liu Ningyi spoke successively. They unanimously believed that the Third World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament further promoted the unity of the peoples of Asian and African countries and peace-loving people all over the world. The resolutions of this conference and the joint declaration issued by representatives of Asian and African countries will surely be supported by the peoples of Asian and African countries and the peoples of all countries in the world. The Chinese people are willing to work with the people of all countries to realize the resolutions of the conference, to defeat the United States' atomic blackmail, to destroy the atomic war system, and to persevere in the struggle to maintain lasting world peace.

    世界和平力量又一次大团结
    蔡廷锴向和大等三团体传达禁止氢弹世界大会情况
    据新华社6日讯　蔡廷锴说，在日本东京举行的第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会，是一次有着重要收获的成功的大会。各国代表对各项问题所取得的意见一致，说明了世界和平力量的又一次的大团结和这一团结的日益巩固。
    蔡廷锴曾率领中国代表团出席了这次大会，今天晚上他在中国三团体举行的联席会议上作了会议经过情况的报告。这三个团体是：第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会中国筹备委员会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国亚洲团结委员会。
  会议由郭沫若主持，到会的有陈叔通、李德全、邵力子、李烛尘、朱学范、刘宁一、刘格平、陈翰笙、陈其尤、谢雪红、许宝驹、萧三等多人。
    蔡廷锴在报告中说，第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会历时十一天，参加大会的共有来自亚、非、欧、美、澳五大洲二十五个国家和十个国际组织的九十七名代表和日本各群众团体、各地方的代表三千九百八十一名，还有几千名旁听者。在大会最后一天——8月16日的全体会议上，与会者全体一致通过了这次大会的三项正式文件：“东京宣言”、“向联合国和全世界各国政府的呼吁书”和“关于为了禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军采取共同行动的建议”。
    蔡廷锴说，中国代表团秉承着全国六亿人民的和平意志和我国的和平政策，认真而积极地参加了大会的各种会议，同来自世界各地的朋友们真挚地交换了意见，并且在求同存异的精神下，和各国的代表一道作出了大会的各项决议。
    蔡廷锴说，这次大会的收获是很丰富的。来自各国的代表和日本的代表在要求立即停止核武器试验，禁止制造、贮存和使用核武器，要求普遍裁减军备，反对在他国领土上建立和扩大军事基地等等问题上，取得意见的一致，说明了世界和平力量又一次的大团结和这一团结的日益巩固。大会一致通过的三项文件，更明确地为世界爱好和平人民指出了斗争的方向。亚非各国代表在这次大会之后发表的联合宣言，就喊出了这一地区人民共同的声音，反映了他们团结一致的巨大力量。他们并要求尽早召开一次像1955年4月在印度首都新德里举行的亚洲国家会议一样的亚非国家会议，埃及朋友已经表示这个会议可以在开罗举行，时间可能在今年秋天或初冬。
    中国出席第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会代表团副团长赵朴初作了补充报告。赵朴初还宣读了日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会感谢中国六团体捐款慰问日本原子核武器受害者的来信。
    会上，郭沫若、李德全、刘宁一先后发言。他们一致认为，第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会，进一步促进了亚非各国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的团结。这次大会的决议和亚非国家代表所发表的联合宣言，一定会得到亚非国家人民和全世界各国人民的支持。中国人民愿同各国人民一起，为实现大会的决议，为击破美国的原子讹诈，摧毁原子战争体系和维护世界持久和平而坚持不渝地斗争。
