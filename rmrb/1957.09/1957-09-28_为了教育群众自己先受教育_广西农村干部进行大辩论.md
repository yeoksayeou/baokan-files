According to the Guangxi Daily, in September, various counties in Guangxi Province successively convened meetings of cadres at the county, district, and township levels, or cadres at the county and district levels, to launch a vigorous airing of views, full blooming of opinions, and a grand debate on grain policies and collectivization. This enhanced the cadres' ability to distinguish between major rights and wrongs and taught them how to lead the masses in a grand debate, creating conditions for the smooth development of the all-people socialist grand debate.

After the airing of views and full blooming of opinions, various counties universally seized on major issues of right and wrong such as "Has the unified purchase and sale of grain been handled poorly?" and "Does collectivization have advantages?" to launch debates. The main issues raised by cadres in various regions were statements like insufficient grain rations, lack of freedom in the unified purchase and sale of grain, no improvement in farmers' lives, advanced cooperatives being inferior to elementary cooperatives, elementary cooperatives being inferior to individual farmers, and collectivization proceeding too quickly. At the meetings, heated debates revolved around these issues, and the broad masses of cadres used methods of recalling the past, making comparisons, and calculating accounts to present a large number of facts to refute these arguments. At the Baise County meeting, twenty-three cadres from the Liangpa District calculated their household grain rations one by one. According to the grain ration standards, nine of these twenty-three households had enough to eat, and five households could not finish their rations. Nine households believed they did not have enough to eat because of serious waste. At the Hechi County meeting, some also felt that grain rations were insufficient. The Party branch secretary of Shuiren Township used the township's production level and population increase in recent years to explain that grain rations should be based on production levels. In 1954, the township had only 1,326 people, but now it has increased by 300 people. If calculated according to the 460-jin grain ration standard, it would require an additional 138,000 jin of grain for distribution. However, the township's grain production has increased by only a little over 100,000 jin in recent years, barely enough to meet the needs of the increased population. He said, "Still demanding increased grain rations, can we ask the cities for grain to improve rural life?" This powerful speech refuted the argument that grain rations were insufficient.

At the Liujiang County meeting, when debating the issue of collectivization, some said that advanced cooperatives were inferior to elementary cooperatives, and life was getting worse and worse after transitioning to advanced cooperatives. The director of the Silian Agricultural Cooperative said, "Whether it is getting worse and worse must be seen through facts. In Silian Township, the income was 1.9 million jin of grain in 1955. After transitioning to an advanced cooperative last year, grain production increased to 2.06 million jin; there were 470 households in difficulty in the township during the elementary cooperative stage, but now the number of households in difficulty has decreased to 200; there were 130 students in school in the township during the elementary cooperative stage, but now the number of students attending school has increased to 390..." Some also claimed that every household in the advanced cooperative was borrowing money and becoming poor. Those who refuted this argument said that borrowing did occur, but the true situation of borrowing must be examined. They cited the example of the first production team of the Xiajie Village in the Jinde Cooperative, which had the most borrowing: twelve out of fifteen cooperative members in this team borrowed money from the cooperative. But what did they do with the borrowed money? Liu Zhenhe borrowed 80 yuan to become a chicken peddler, Chen Hongyi owed the cooperative 65 yuan, but his family raised a large pig worth 130 yuan..., among the twelve households, except for one household that was truly in difficulty, the others were capable of repaying but were unwilling to repay. After analyzing the facts, everyone realized that the reason for excessive borrowing was due to the influence of capitalist ideology and a lack of love for the collective, not because the cooperative was bad. Faced with irrefutable facts, those who believed that advanced cooperatives were inferior to elementary cooperatives and that farmers' lives were getting worse and worse were convinced.

Through debate, those who held erroneous views distinguished between right and wrong on the two roads of socialism and capitalism, enhanced their understanding, and at the same time learned the skills of leading debates. Cadres in Guiping County said: Originally, we unconsciously fostered capitalist ideas. If these ideas were allowed to develop, wouldn't the socialism we worked so hard to build be undermined? Cadres in Cangwu County said: This socialist education movement is truly like a "panacea." If this kind of education is not carried out in time, who knows how many people would fall into the capitalist fire pit! According to statistics from Guixian County, among the 826 cadres attending the meeting in fifteen districts, 201 were dissatisfied with collectivization and unified purchase and sale before the meeting, and only 25 remained dissatisfied with collectivization and unified purchase and sale after the meeting. The vast majority of people received a profound education in the debate.

According to statistics from relevant provincial departments, as of the 20th, cadre meetings in 48 counties have ended, and meetings in other counties are still continuing.

### 为了教育群众自己先受教育  广西农村干部进行大辩论

    为了教育群众自己先受教育
    广西农村干部进行大辩论
    据广西日报消息　9月间，广西省各县先后召开了县、区、乡三级干部或县、区两级干部会议，就粮食政策和合作化问题展开大鸣大放大争，提高了干部辨别大是大非的能力，并使他们学会了领导群众大辩论的本领，为全民社会主义大辩论的顺利开展创造了条件。
    大鸣大放之后，各县普遍抓住“粮食统购统销是不是搞糟了”“合作化有没有优越性”等大是大非问题展开辩论。说留粮不够吃、粮食统购统销不自由、农民生活没有改善、高级社不如初级社、初级社不如单干农民、合作化走得太快了，这是各地干部提出来的主要问题。会上，都围绕这些问题展开了热烈的争论，广大干部运用回忆、对比、算账的办法摆出大量事实，批驳这些论调。百色县的会议上，两琶区的二十三个干部一一算了本户的留粮账，按照留粮标准，这二十三户有九户够吃，五户吃不完。有九户认为不够吃，是因为有较严重的浪费现象。河池县的会议上也有人认为留粮不够吃。水任乡党支部书记以该乡几年来生产水平和人口增加情况，说明留粮要从生产水平出发的道理。1954年，这个乡只有一千三百二十六人，但现在已增加了三百人。若以四百六十斤留粮标准计算，就需要增加十三万八千斤粮食才够分配。而该乡几年来增产粮食不过十多万斤，勉强够增加人口的需要。他说：“还要求增加留粮，难道能够向城市要粮食来改善农村生活吗？”这一席话有力地驳倒了留粮不够吃的论调。
    柳江县的会议上，在辩论到合作化问题时，有人说高级社不如初级社，转高级社后生活越来越糟。四连农业社的主任说：“是不是越来越糟，这要看事实。四连乡1955年收入粮食一百九十万斤，去年转高级社后，粮食产量增加到二百零六万斤；初级社时全乡有四百七十户困难户，现在困难户减少到二百户；初级社时全乡有一百三十个在校学生，现在上学的增加到三百九十人……”。还有的人提出高级社户户借贷，都借穷了。批驳这种论调的人说借贷的事是有的，但要看借贷的真实情况。他们举出借贷多的进德社下街屯第一生产队的事实：这个队十五户社员有十二户借了社的钱。但借了钱去做什么呢？刘振和借了八十元去做鸡贩，陈宏义欠社六十五元，家里却养有价值一百三十元的大猪……，十二户中除一户确实有困难的，其他都是有能力偿还而不肯偿还的。经过分析事实，大家看出借支多的原来是由于资本主义思想作祟和缺乏爱社思想的结果，不是合作社不好。在铁的事实面前，认为高级社不如初级社、农民生活越来越糟的人都口服心服。
    经过辩论，使持有错误看法的人在社会主义和资本主义两条道路间分清了是非，提高了认识，同时学会了领导辩论的本领。桂平县的干部说：原来我们不知不觉滋长了资本主义思想。这种思想要任其发展下去，我们千辛万苦建立起来的社会主义，不是要给搞垮吗？苍梧县的干部说：这次的社会主义教育运动真像“仙丹”，若不及时进行这种教育，不知有多少人要跌下资本主义的火坑呢！据贵县的统计：十五个区的到会干部八百二十六人中，会前对合作化和统购统销问题不满的有二百零一人，会后对合作化和统购统销问题仍然不满意的只剩下二十五人，绝大部分人在辩论中受到了深刻的教育。
    据省有关部门统计，到20日止，四十八个县的干部会议已经结束，其他各县的会议还在继续进行。
