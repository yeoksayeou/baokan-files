Xinhua News Agency, London, September 19th: Two white papers released by the British government on September 18th reveal that Britain and Malaya have secretly agreed that military forces will continue to be used to suppress the Malayan Communist Party, and that Malaya will be maintained as a permanent British military base in Southeast Asia.

One of these two white papers, which were also released in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of the Federation of Malaya, discusses the terms of the so-called military agreement for "external defense and mutual assistance" between Britain and Malaya, while the other discusses the arrangements for using Commonwealth troops to suppress the Malayan Communist Party. The military agreement requires the approval of the Legislative Council of the Federation of Malaya.

The military agreement stipulates that Britain can continue to station troops in Malaya, including a Commonwealth strategic reserve force. This force will not only bear the task of so-called assisting Malaya in "external defense," but also fulfill the obligations stipulated in various military treaties to which Britain and the Commonwealth are parties.

The white paper on arrangements for the armed suppression of the Malayan Communist Party indicates that Australian and New Zealand troops will continue to participate in the war against the Malayan Communist Party alongside British troops.

According to the agreement, the Federation of Malaya will establish an emergency action committee to oversee the suppression of the Malayan Communist Party. Military operations will be commanded by a British officer with the rank of Lieutenant General, acting as the so-called Commander of Emergency Operations. British Army Lieutenant General Cassels is currently serving in this position in Malaya.

　　英政府发表的白皮书透露
　　马来亚仍受英国军事控制
    据新华社伦敦19日电　英国政府在9月18日发表的两项白皮书中透露，英国和马来亚在秘密达成的协定中规定继续使用军事力量来镇压马来亚共产党，并且把马来亚保持为英国在东南亚的永久性军事基地。
    这两项同时也在马来亚联合邦首都吉隆坡公布的白皮书中的一项谈到英国和马来亚之间所谓“对外防御和互相援助”的军事协定的条文，另一项谈到了使用英联邦军队来镇压马来亚共产党的安排。军事协定需要经过马来亚联合邦立法议会的批准。
    军事协定规定，英国可以在马来亚继续派驻军队，包括一支英联邦战略后备部队。这支部队不仅负担所谓援助马来亚进行“对外防御”的任务，而且可以履行英国和英联邦所参加的各种军事条约所规定的义务。
    关于武装镇压马来亚共产党的安排的白皮书表明，澳大利亚和新西兰的军队将同英国军队一起继续参加对马来亚共产党进行的战争。
    根据协议，马来亚联合邦将设立一个主持镇压马来亚共产党事务的紧急行动委员会。军事行动将由一个中将级的英国军官以所谓紧急行动指挥官的身份指挥。英国陆军中将卡斯尔斯目前已经在马来亚担任这个职务。
