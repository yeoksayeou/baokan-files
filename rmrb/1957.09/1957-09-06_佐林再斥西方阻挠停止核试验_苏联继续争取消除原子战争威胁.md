    Xinhua News Agency, September 5th, London Dispatch: Soviet representative Zorin, responding to questions raised by Western representatives at the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee meeting on September 4th, pointed out that the United States, Britain, and France continue to obstruct the immediate cessation of testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

    Zorin said that U.S. representative Stassen's questions, such as whether the Soviet Union accepts the proposal to halt testing for two years and whether the Soviet Union's position on establishing supervision (including monitoring stations) in Soviet, American, British territories and the Pacific region has changed, can only be seen as an attempt to distort the Soviet Union's position and thereby evade the questions now being raised by millions of people regarding the position taken by Western countries on the immediate cessation of testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

    Zorin said that at the very beginning of the Subcommittee's work, the Soviet delegation put forward a proposal for the complete cessation of nuclear testing, but this proposal was opposed by the Western delegations. In order to facilitate an agreement, the Soviet government suggested a temporary cessation of nuclear testing for two to three years. The Soviet government supports the establishment of monitoring stations in the territories of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain, and in the Pacific region on an equal basis, and suggests that the issue of stopping testing be separated from the overall disarmament issue and resolved separately and immediately.

    Zorin pointed out that the reason the Subcommittee failed to reach a temporary halt to nuclear testing is that the Western countries fundamentally oppose seriously resolving this issue. The delegations of these countries clearly stated in their "working paper" that they refuse to seek a separate solution to the nuclear testing issue, and that the provisions in the "working paper" are indivisible. This position complicates the issue and obstructs the resolution of these issues with various conditions and reservations. This has created artificial obstacles to the adoption of a resolution for the immediate cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapons testing.

    Zorin pointed out that if the West's comprehensive document is followed, the resolution of each issue will be subject to various conditions and reservations. Zorin asked, isn't this an attempt to conceal the indefinite delay in resolving the simple and urgent issue of stopping nuclear testing? Even the proposal for a possible temporary suspension of testing for one year mentioned in the Western document is accompanied by conditions that undermine the practical significance of the proposal.

    Zorin concluded by saying that the Soviet Union will continue to wage an unremitting struggle to stop the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons as a first step towards stopping the expansion of atomic armaments and eliminating the threat of atomic war.

### 佐林再斥西方阻挠停止核试验  苏联继续争取消除原子战争威胁

    佐林再斥西方阻挠停止核试验
    苏联继续争取消除原子战争威胁
    据新华社5日讯　伦敦消息：苏联代表佐林在9月4日举行的联合国裁军小组委员会会议上回答西方国家代表提出的问题时指出，美英法继续阻挠立即停止试验原子武器和氢武器。
    佐林说，美国代表史塔生提出苏联是否接受停止试验两年的建议、苏联对在苏美英领土上和太平洋地区建立监督（包括监督站）的立场是否有所改变之类的问题，只能使人认为是想歪曲苏联的立场，从而逃避现在千百万人就西方国家对立即停止试验原子武器和氢武器所采取的立场提出的问题。
    佐林说，在小组委员会工作刚一开始的时候苏联代表团就提出了完全停止核试验的建议，但是这项建议遭到了西方国家代表团的反对。为了便于达成协议，苏联政府建议暂时停止核试验两三年，苏联政府支持在苏美英三国领土上和太平洋地区在平等的基础上建立监督站，并建议把停止试验问题同总的裁军问题分开来，立即加以单独解决。
    佐林指出，小组委员会未能达成暂时停止核试验的原因，是西方国家根本反对认真地解决这个问题。这些国家的代表团在自己的“工作文件”里明确地声明，他们拒绝寻求单独解决核试验问题，“工作文件”中的条款是不可分割的。他们这种立场使问题变得错综复杂起来，并且以种种条件和保留阻碍这些问题的解决。这样就为通过立即停止原子武器和氢武器试验的决议造成了人为的障碍。
    佐林指出，如果按照西方国家的综合文件行事，那么每个问题的解决都要有种种条件和保留。佐林问道，难道这不是要掩饰无限期地拖延解决简单而刻不容缓的停止核试验的问题吗？甚至在西方的文件里提到的可能暂时停止试验一年的主张，也附带了种种破坏了这项建议的实际意义的条件。
    佐林最后说，苏联将继续进行不懈的斗争，争取停止试验原子武器和氢武器，作为停止原子军备扩张和消除原子战争威胁的第一步。
