Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 24th: Zhejiang Province is conscientiously summarizing the pilot experiences of basic-level rectification in 193 townships, so as to correctly guide the province's future phased basic-level rectification and socialist education movement.

The experiences of these pilot townships prove that resolving the ideological obstacles of basic-level cadres to the "Big Blooming, Big Contending" is a key to fully mobilizing the masses to engage in "Big Blooming, Big Contending, and Big Debates." At the beginning of the rectification in these townships, many basic-level cadres believed that "Big Blooming, Big Contending" was "making trouble out of nothing," fearing that "blooming" would cause chaos, fearing that it would be directed at them, and that it would be difficult to end, so they dared not let go and mobilize the masses to engage in "Big Blooming, Big Contending."

Judging from the pilot townships where the rectification has been carried out relatively well, a series of arduous and meticulous ideological work is needed to fully mobilize the masses to engage in "Big Blooming, Big Contending, and Big Debates." Some townships in Jiaxing, Ningbo, Wenzhou, and other regions first carried out "Big Blooming, Big Contending" among basic-level cadres. Through debates, the cadres clearly understood the purpose, requirements, and significance of the rectification, and the benefits of mobilizing the masses to engage in "Big Blooming, Big Contending." After the cadres reversed their resistance, they actively and boldly mobilized farmers of all strata to speak out freely.

These pilot townships also paid attention to dispelling some farmers' concerns about retaliation and persecution. In addition to repeatedly explaining the principles of speaking out freely and expressing their attitudes, they generally emphasized implementing the spirit of rectifying and correcting simultaneously, and showed the masses actual actions. Some pilot townships in Ningbo, Wenzhou, and other regions established special problem research groups and accounting groups during the "blooming," accepted the correct opinions of the masses, and immediately improved their work. Some cadres with shortcomings in their work style also accepted the opinions of the masses and made public self-criticisms. In this way, farmers of all strata boldly put forward their opinions, the work style of cadres and practical work were continuously improved, and current production was promoted at the same time.

    浙江总结基层整风的试点经验
    解决基层干部思想障碍是发动群众大鸣大放的关键
    据新华社杭州24日电　浙江省正在认真总结在一百九十三个乡进行基层整风的试点经验，以便用来正确地指导全省今后分期分批进行基层整风和社会主义教育的运动。
    这些试点乡的经验证明，解决基层干部对大鸣大放的思想障碍，是发动群众大鸣大放大争的重要关键。这些乡在开始整风时，不少基层干部认为大鸣大放是“无事生事”，怕“放”乱了，怕“放”到自己头上，不好收场，因而不敢放手发动群众大鸣大放。
    从整风开展得比较好的试点乡来看，要做到充分发动群众进行大鸣大放大争，需要做一系列的艰苦细致的思想工作。嘉兴、宁波、温州等专区一些乡就是在基层干部中首先进行大鸣大放，通过辩论，使干部明确认识整风的目的、要求和意义，发动群众大鸣大放有什么好处。干部在扭转抵触情绪以后，都积极地大胆放手地发动各阶层农民大放大鸣。
    这些试点乡还注意解除有些农民怕报复怕挨整的顾虑。他们除了反复交代鸣放方针和表示态度以外，一般都强调贯彻边整边改的精神，拿实际行动给群众看。宁波、温州等专区有些试点乡在鸣放中成立了专门问题研究小组、算账小组，接受群众的正确意见，立即改进工作。有些作风上有缺点的干部也接受群众的意见，公开作了检讨。这样，各阶层农民就大胆地提意见，干部作风和实际工作不断得到改进，同时推动了当前的生产。
