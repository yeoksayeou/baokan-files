　　Criticizing Jiang Feng's Anti-Party Thoughts in Literature and Art
　　Wang Chaowen

　　(I)
　　The exposure of Jiang Feng's anti-Party group has caused indignation among artists nationwide because he has caused serious damage to China's art cause.

　　Driven by the ambition of personal dominance, exaggerating one's own role, overestimating one's own prestige, and holding a one-sided view of issues, he stubbornly persisted in forming an anti-Party situation on a series of major issues related to organizational and literary lines, refusing to turn back. According to materials revealed by many artists at meetings, Jiang Feng did not regard the literary and art cause as a part of the Party's overall cause, submitting to the overall revolutionary interests, nor did he accept the Party's leadership and supervision. In order to confront the Party, Jiang Feng used all means to expand his power. In terms of the school's teaching ideology, curriculum arrangements, personnel transfers, publications, and attempts to organize alumni associations and painting societies, his aim was to pull the art cause out from under the Party's leadership and supervision. In fact, the Central Academy of Fine Arts had become an independent kingdom that refused to be inspected by higher authorities and did not accept orders. Jiang Feng believed that not following him in opposing the Party meant "lacking class feelings," and that anyone who reported his mistakes to higher authorities was violating organizational principles. In fact, the Party organization of the Academy of Fine Arts not only deceived higher authorities and covered up Jiang Feng's crimes, but also served as an executive body for Jiang Feng's anti-Party activities. On the issue of specialization, Jiang Feng used bourgeois individualism to educate students, teaching them not to rely on the organization, but to "each carve out their own path." Their May 25th demonstration against the Party was merely a prelude to seizing the leadership of the Artists Association during the October National Congress of Literary and Art Workers this year. If leadership could not be seized, they would start anew, setting up a set of institutions to confront the Party. Although the "Art" monthly could not be seized, "Art Research," as an anti-Party tool, had already been published. "Art Research" has already published some anti-Party articles, opposing the Marxist-Leninist aesthetic principles. On major issues, Jiang Feng had lost the position of a revolutionary, even to the point of hating and slandering the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, a necessary measure to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. Jiang Feng, who regarded himself as a revolutionary, had completely embarked on a dead end road that ran counter to the Party.

　　(II)
　　One aspect of Jiang Feng's anti-Party stance was his advocacy of the so-called revolutionary school, opposing the Party's "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy for promoting creation. At the Second National Congress of Literary and Art Workers in September 1953, Comrade Zhou Yang gave a clear exposition of this policy:

　　"Comrade Mao Zedong's principle of 'Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom,' as instructed regarding opera activities, should become the guiding principle for the development of the entire literary and art cause. We need figure paintings as well as landscape paintings; we need fighting marches as well as lyrical songs; we need advanced and complex art forms as well as a large number of simple art forms."

　　This was obviously not just to give play to the individualities and specialties of artists with different artistic accomplishments, life experiences, and artistic tastes, but more importantly to meet the people's ever-growing aesthetic demands. However, in Jiang Feng's view, this was opposed to socialist realism, unrevolutionary, and the object that their "school" wanted to "revolutionize." The real revolutionaries held the opposite view to Jiang Feng, the rightist: the people's appreciation demands are multifaceted, and opposing "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" actually means not satisfying the people's multifaceted aesthetic demands, which means that art is divorced from the masses. The Jiang Feng group advocated so-called thematic paintings, as if landscape paintings and flower-and-bird paintings had no theme. He regarded landscape paintings and flower-and-bird paintings as serving the leisure class, unable to serve revolutionary politics. He dared to say openly that only one flower was allowed to bloom at the Academy of Fine Arts. (I would like to mention in passing: the Jiang Feng anti-Party group, which opposed the Party's "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy, was so despicable as to spread rumors, saying that the Ministry of Culture was excluding oil paintings, wanting to use this to instigate oil painters to oppose the Party.)

　　Jiang Feng was not completely ignorant of the fact that socialist realism is the best method of creation, but not the only method. The depiction of modern life with significant meaning is always what we want to emphasize, but in no way can it be said to be the only subject matter. In order to confront the Party's policies, he deliberately lowered the value of various subjects and forms. Of course, in order for literature and art to maintain close ties with the people, that is, in order to promote, consolidate, and improve the class consciousness of the working people, and to encourage the working people to strive for new achievements in socialist construction, it is necessary to depict the noble qualities of the working people in revolutionary struggles. However, just as Party spirit and the people's character are not opposed, the educational role of art and the satisfaction of aesthetic enjoyment should not be opposed either. Even the decorative arts, such as architecture and crafts, which do not directly depict people but embody human beauty, should be appropriately promoted. Why must landscape paintings and flower-and-bird paintings be excluded from the art field that serves the people? Good landscape paintings and flower-and-bird paintings can cultivate people's healthy emotions and noble aesthetic tastes. However, Jiang Feng completely denied that landscape paintings have a certain educational significance, and insisted on saying that the art work led by the Party in recent years was "one step forward, two steps back." Even the articles published recently in "Art" show the prejudice that he wanted to hide but could not hide. He often opposes reflecting modern life with inheriting tradition, opposes the task of educating the people with satisfying the people's aesthetic needs, opposes serving workers, peasants, and soldiers with diverse forms, and opposes popularization with improvement, just as he opposes democracy with centralization, just as he opposes the Party's education and care for Party members by saying that the Party is "making things difficult" for him.

　　Jiang Feng's mechanical and contradictory arguments are incompatible with the dialectical scientific method. However, this is not just a deviation in academic thought, but mainly to create an anti-Party pretext to confuse the masses. Is it also a deviation in view to slander the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee for "only wanting appreciation and not wanting education?" No, just like advocating a revolutionary school, it is the concretization of anti-Party intentions.

　　(III)
　　Another important aspect of Jiang Feng's anti-Party stance is his stubborn denial of the excellent traditions of Chinese art. In order to confront the Party's literary and art policies, he did not hesitate to obliterate the superiority of traditional painting. He believed that Chinese paintings that appeared in feudal society, were primitive, low-level, unscientific, and therefore could not reflect reality. They dared to say that "Chinese painting has no world significance and will inevitably be eliminated in the future." "As long as it is painted by a Chinese, it is Chinese painting."

　　In Yan'an and at North China University, Jiang Feng often used the phrase "interests of the literati class" as a weapon to attack comrades who were interested in studying the rules of traditional literature and art. While belittling and despising national traditions, Jiang Feng stubbornly advocated using Western painting standards to demand Chinese painting, and even using Western painting techniques to transform China's traditional painting techniques that are unique in the world. He believed that only by learning Western-style sketching could the backward state of Chinese painting be changed. As long as Western-style sketching is learned well, and Chinese painting tools are used, authentic Chinese paintings can be painted. When I learned that Wang Xun's article denying the scientific nature of Chinese painting and wanting to use Western painting techniques to transform Chinese painting was published in "Art" and caused opposition from Chinese painters, I asked Wang Xun why he viewed Chinese painting in this way. He said that he had discussed it with Jiang Feng beforehand, and Jiang Feng encouraged him to insist on this point of view. Comrades say that Jiang Feng and his anti-Party "military advisor" want to eliminate Chinese painting and replace Chinese painting with Western painting, which is not without basis. They fundamentally denied the truth that the more national it is, the more international it is.

　　At the May 25th meeting organized by Jiang Feng to attack the Ministry of Culture, the statements that portrayed Jiang Feng as a leader who loved national art were completely turning black and white upside down. Jiang Feng opposes national traditional painting, and does not understand national traditional painting either. It is not easy to understand the sea of rich national art. I myself understand too little, so in the past, even when I wanted to protect it, I still made disproportionate explanations of its negative aspects. I didn't understand it before, but now I can strive to understand more, but because Jiang Feng doesn't love it, he doesn't want to understand it. In recent years, in order to oppose the Party, he does not hesitate to say that it is worthless.

　　Some may ask: Hasn't Jiang Feng also praised the characteristics of Chinese painting? Hasn't he also introduced these characteristics to foreign friends? Yes, I have also heard him say more than once: Chinese painting has a full composition, brisk lines, and bright colors... However, these praises are really not enough to explain the characteristics of Chinese painting, let alone to explain ink wash painting. Moreover, this kind of praise does not start from the content, techniques, and style of the works, but from the techniques. Just as in another situation he despises Chinese painters for not understanding perspective, anatomy, and color science, and therefore Chinese painting is primitive and backward, these two contradictory statements have a common basis: a technical point of view. This point of view is in line with his narrow view of the realistic method of creation, and also consistent with his tendency to focus on technology first when looking at new works.

　　In order to oppose the Party's literary and art policies, Jiang Feng opposes Chinese painting. In order to oppose Chinese painting, he does not hesitate to confuse creation methods with techniques. If technology is the method, many phenomena in the history of painting cannot be judged. Even in bourgeois modern art, some are not lower than the masters of realism in terms of technology. Impressionist colors can be learned, but it is not a creative method, and based on this alone, it is impossible to judge whether the relationship between the work and reality is correct. Realism is at least not entirely a technical issue, and looking only at technology at least cannot distinguish between naturalism and realism. Jiang Feng, disregarding the important role of nationality in art, starts from the common sense of anatomy, perspective, and color science in Western technology, and uses it as a standard to measure whether the images in Chinese painting are realistic, thereby negating Chinese painting. Inheritance is of course for development, but we firmly oppose "innovation" that deviates from tradition and forces Chinese painting to Westernize. Aragon said: "To demand that we abandon the characteristics of French poetry is tantamount to demanding that we abandon our national sovereignty." In our new society, belittling or despising the traditions of the motherland is also a reflection of the most despicable bourgeois psychology.

　　One of the most important and basic issues of realism is how to realistically reproduce reality through the artist's subjectivity. That is to say, the artistic image is neither a deduction of the artist's narrow subjective understanding, nor a mechanical copy of objective reality. This contradiction repeatedly appears in the artistic phenomena of various eras, and still often troubles artists. The discussion of whether to go deep into life and whether to master the Marxist worldview also reflects that the complex relationship between artists, objective reality, and works is not easy to resolve. Although our traditional literature and art are products of feudal society and artists did not have the most progressive worldview, many patriotic and humanitarian artists in our history have provided strong experience in solving the above-mentioned contradictions in terms of creative methods. It is precisely because this contradiction has been appropriately resolved to a certain extent that Chinese national art has been warmly praised by Soviet art masters Obraztsov and Kukryniksy. The Yuan, Ming, and Qing paintings, especially landscape and flower-and-bird paintings, which the Jiang Feng clique intends to attack as Impressionism, also provide valuable experience in this regard.

　　Of course, it is also wrong to beautify everything from the old era. Comrade Mao Zedong warned us in "On New Democracy" that we must not "praise the old and despise the new." Yuan, Ming, and Qing paintings do have their negative aspects. Not seeing this is bourgeois conservatism. Unilaterally emphasizing calligraphic interest and deviating from the depiction of the object, this formalistic tendency should not be inherited and should be opposed. Unilaterally emphasizing learning from the ancients and using plagiarism to replace creation. This tendency to deviate from life should not be inherited and should be opposed. Ignoring the aesthetic demands of the broad masses of people and opposing the air of scholarship with reality. This tendency to deviate from the people should not be inherited and should be opposed. However, we cannot therefore completely deny the creative experience and regular knowledge of Yuan, Ming, and Qing paintings. Just taking the Qing Dynasty as an example, the works and paintings of great masters such as Shi Tao, Bada Shanren, Jin Nong, and Luo Ping, which are full of personality and dare to create boldly, and how artists avoid directly making tedious records and explanations for life in the relationship between "things" and "I", but rather express and chant enthusiastically, clearly, and implicitly, etc., not only opened up the road for great painters such as Wu Changshuo and Qi Baishi, but should also become the object of our learning.

　　Even taking a step back to examine the techniques of Chinese ink wash painting, such as Qi Baishi's animals and flowers and plants, the brush and ink are simplified to the point of no simplification, not only expressing the body, shape, texture, dynamics, and spirit of the objects, but also easily making people understand the painter's love for these vibrant creatures. These brush and ink, which have calligraphic interest and are unique to Chinese painting with their rich summary and expressive power, are very valuable techniques. Not every complication is an improvement. From complexity to simplicity is also an improvement. Why must we say that Chinese paintings with refined brush and ink and rich content are backward and unscientific and must be replaced by Western painting techniques?

　　Denying that traditional Chinese painting has its unique modeling foundation, fundamentally not valuing the brush and ink techniques that constitute the characteristics of Chinese painting, and not hesitating to say that certain oil paintings possess the characteristics of Chinese painting in order to attack Chinese painting, is really nonsense that does not want traditional techniques.

　　Jiang Feng, who slandered that "the Ministry of Culture only wants tradition and does not want revolution," has degenerated to the point of betraying the Party. The artists who participated in the meeting to criticize him exposed many crimes and made severe criticisms of his various anti-Party despicable means. I completely agree with this criticism. This article is just some supplementary opinions on issues related to the literary and art line. In order to ensure the Party's leadership in the field of literature and art, and for our own ideological transformation and improvement, we must continue to criticize Jiang Feng.

　　批判江丰在文艺上的反党思想
　　王朝闻
　　（一）
    江丰反党集团的罪行揭发后，全国美术家都感到愤慨。因为他给中国美术事业造成了严重的损失。
    由于个人称霸的野心在作怪，把个人的作用想像得太大，把自己的威信想像得太高，看问题片面，固执己见，在一系列的有关组织路线和文艺路线的重大问题上，形成了反党的局面而仍不回头。据许多美术家在会议上所揭发的材料，江丰不是把文艺事业当成党的整个事业的一部分，服从整体的革命利益，不是接受党的领导和监督。为了与党对抗，江丰使用一切手段扩充实力。在学校的教学思想、课程的安排、人事调动和刊物方面，以及企图组织校友会、画会等都是要把美术事业从党的领导和监督之下拉出来。事实上中央美术学院已经成了拒绝上级检查、不接受命令的独立王国。江丰认为不跟着他反党就是“没有阶级感情”，谁要向上级汇报他的错误就算是违反了组织原则。事实上美术学院的党组织不仅欺骗了上级，掩护江丰的罪行，而且曾经是江丰反党活动的执行机构。在专业化问题上，江丰用资产阶级个人主义思想教育学生，教学生不要依靠组织，“各人自己去闯一条路”。他们5月25日的向党示威，还不过是企图在今年十月文代会期间夺取美术家协会领导权的前奏。领导权如果夺不到也要另起炉灶，搞一套与党对抗的各种机构。“美术”月刊虽然夺不到手，作为反党工具的“美术研究”已经出版了。“美术研究”已经发表了一些反党的文章，反对马克思列宁主义的美学原则。江丰在重大问题上已经丧失了革命者的立场，竟至憎恨和污蔑肃反运动这一巩固人民民主专政的必要措施。以革命者自居的江丰，完全走上了和党背道而驰的死路。
　　（二）
    江丰反党的一个方面，是标榜所谓革命学派，反对党繁荣创作的“百花齐放”的方针。这个方针，1953年9月第二次文代会上，周扬同志作过明确的阐述：
    毛泽东同志关于戏曲活动所指示的“百花齐放”的原则应当成为整个文学艺术事业发展的方针。我们既需要人物画，也需要风景画；既需要战斗的进行曲，也需要抒情的歌曲；我们既需要有比较高级的、复杂的艺术形式，也需要有大量的、比较简易的艺术形式。”
    这显然不只是为了发挥艺术修养不同、生活经历不同和艺术趣味不尽相同的艺术家们的个性和特长，更重要的是为了适应人民日益发展的审美要求。可是在江丰看来，这是和社会主义现实主义对立的，是不革命的，是他们的“学派”所要“革命”的对象。真正革命者和右派的江丰的看法相反：人民的欣赏要求是多方面的，反对“百花齐放”实际就是不要满足人民多方面的审美要求，也就是意味着艺术脱离群众。江丰集团标榜所谓主题性绘画，似乎山水画和花鸟画都是没有主题的。他把山水画和花鸟画当成是为有闲阶级服务的，不能为革命的政治服务的。他公然敢说在美术学院只准一花独放。（我想附带提到这一点：反对党“百花齐放”方针的江丰反党集团，竟然卑鄙到造谣的程度，说文化部排斥油画，想借此挑拨油画家反党。）
    江丰不至于根本不知道：社会主义现实主义是最好的创作方法，但不是唯一的方法。意义重大的现代生活的描写永远是我们所要强调的，但无论如何不能说它是唯一的题材。为了和党的方针对立，有意降低各种题材各种形式的价值。当然，为了文艺同人民保持密切的联系，也就是为了发扬和巩固、提高劳动人民的阶级觉悟，鼓舞劳动人民为社会主义建设的新成就而努力，必须描写劳动人民在革命斗争中的高贵品质。可是，正如党性与人民性不是对立的一样，艺术的教育作用与美的享受的满足也应该不是对立的。不直接描写人却也体现了人的美感的装饰性的艺术，例如建筑、工艺尚且有必要适当提倡，为什么一定要把山水画和花鸟画排斥在为人民服务的艺术领域之外？好的山水画和花鸟画能够培养人民健康的感情和高尚的审美趣味。可是江丰完全否认风景画有一定的教育意义，硬把这几年党所领导的美术工作说成是“进一步，退两步”。就是最近在“美术”上发表的文章，也可以看出他想要掩盖而又无法掩盖的偏见。他常常是把反映现代生活与继承传统对立起来，把教育人民的任务与满足人民审美需要对立起来，把为工农兵服务与形式多样化对立起来，把普及与提高对立起来，正如他把民主与集中对立起来一样，正如他把党对他的教育和党对党员的爱护对立起来说成是“搞”他一样。
    江丰这些机械的矛盾的论调，和辩证的科学方法不相容。可是这不只是学术思想的偏差，最主要的是为了制造迷惑群众的反党的口实。难道诬蔑党中央的领导同志“只要欣赏不要教育”的话也是看法上的偏差吗？不，正如标榜革命学派一样，是反党意图的具体化。
    （三）
    江丰反党的另一个重要方面，是顽强地否定中国艺术的优良传统。为了与党的文艺方针对立，不惜抹煞传统绘画的优越性。他认为出现在封建社会的中国画，其方法是原始的，低级的，不科学因而不能反映现实的。他们敢于说“中国画没有世界意义，将来必然会被淘汰”。“只要是中国人画的就是中国画”。
  在延安，在华北大学，江丰就常常用“士大夫阶级趣味”这句话作为武器，打击一些对于传统的文学、美术的规律有研究兴趣的同志。江丰在轻视和蔑视民族传统的同时，顽强地主张用西洋画的标准来要求中国画，甚至要用西洋画的技术改造中国在世界上独树一帜的传统的绘画技术。他认为只有学习西洋式的素描，才能够改变中国画落后的状况。只要学习好西洋式的素描，用中国画的工具，就可以画出道地的中国画。当我知道王逊否认中国画的科学性、要用西洋画技术改造中国画的文章在“美术”发表，而且引起国画家的反对之后，我问王逊为什么会这样看待中国画。他说他事前和江丰商量过，江丰怂恿他坚持这一论点。同志们说江丰及其反党的“军师”要消灭中国画，使西洋画代替中国画，不是没有根据的。他们根本否认了愈有民族性才愈有国际性的真理。
    今年5月25日江丰组织的美术界向文化部进攻的会议上，那些把江丰说成是热爱民族艺术的领袖的发言，完全是颠倒黑白的。江丰反对民族传统的绘画，也不懂得民族传统的绘画。烟海一样丰富的民族艺术，全懂是不容易的。我自己就因为懂得太少，过去即令为了保护它，也还把它消极的一面作了缺乏分寸的解释。从前不懂，现在可以争取多懂一些，可是因为江丰不爱它，也就不想懂得它。近年来为了反党，更不惜把它说得一钱不值。
    可能有人会问：江丰不是也称赞过中国画的特点吗？不是还向外国朋友介绍过这种特点吗？是的，我也不只一次听见他说过：中国画的构图饱满，线条明快，色彩鲜明，……。可是这些称赞实在不足以说明中国画的特征，更不能用来解释水墨画。而且这种称赞不是从作品的内容、技巧和风格出发的，而是从技术出发的。正如他在另一种情况之下鄙视中国画家不懂透视、解剖和色彩学知识因而中国画是原始的和落后的一样，这两种矛盾的说法有一个共通的基础：技术观点。这种观点，和他对于现实主义创作方法的狭窄看法相适应，也和他看新作品往往首先从技术上着眼的情况相一致。
    为了反对党的文艺方针，江丰反对中国画，为了反对中国画，他不惜把创作方法与技术混淆。如果技术就是方法，绘画史上很多现象就无法判断。即令是资产阶级现代的艺术，在技术上，有些并不低于现实主义的大师。印象主义的色彩可以学习，但它不就是创作方法，单靠这一点无从判断作品和现实的关系是否正确。现实主义至少不完全是技术问题，只看技术至少不能区别自然主义与现实主义。而江丰，不顾民族性在艺术上的重要作用，从西洋技术的解剖、透视、色彩学的常识出发，用它来作为衡量中国画中的形象是否现实的标准，从而否定中国画。继承当然是为了发展，但我们坚决反对脱离传统的“革新”，强使中国画西洋化。阿拉贡说：“要求放弃我们法国诗歌的特征，等于要求放弃我们的民族主权。”在我们的新社会，轻视或蔑视祖国的传统，也是最卑鄙的资产阶级心理的一种反映。
    现实主义最重要最基本的问题之一，是如何通过艺术家的主观，真实地再现现实。也就是说，艺术形象既不是艺术家狭窄的主观认识的演绎，又不是客观现实现象的机械的翻版。这一矛盾，反复出现在各个时代的艺术现象之中，至今也还常常使艺术家感到苦恼。是否要深入生活与是否要掌握马克思主义世界观的讨论，也反映了艺术家、客观实际与作品的复杂关系不易解决。而我国的传统文艺，虽然是封建社会的产物，艺术家还没有最进步的世界观，但是，我国历史上有不少具有爱国主义和人道主义的艺术家们，在创作方法上，给解决上述矛盾提供了有力的经验。正是因为在一定角度上适当地解决了这一矛盾，中国民族美术为苏联艺术大师奥布拉卓夫和库克雷尼克塞等同志热烈的称赞。江丰小集团打算作为印象主义来加以攻击的元、明、清绘画，特别是风景画和花鸟画，在这一方面也提供了很可宝贵的经验。
    当然，把一切旧时代的东西加以美化也是不对的。毛泽东同志在“新民主主义论”中就早已警告我们切不可以“颂古非今”。元、明、清绘画确有其消极的一面，不看到这一点就是资产阶级的保守主义。片面强调书法趣味、脱离描写对象，这种形式主义的倾向，不宜继承，应该反对。片面强调向古人学习，用抄袭代替创造。这种脱离生活的倾向，不宜继承，应该反对。无视广大人民的审美要求，把书卷气与现实性对立起来。这种脱离人民的倾向，不宜继承，应该反对。可是，不能因此全盘否定元、明、清绘画的创造经验与规律性的知识。仅就清代而论，像石涛，八大，金农，罗聘诸大家那些富于个性敢于大胆创造的作品和画论，在“物”与“我”的关系问题上，艺术家如何避免直截了当地为生活作乏味的记录和解释，而是既热情、明确而又含蓄地表现和吟咏，等等，不只给吴昌硕、齐白石等大画家开辟了道路，也应该成为我们学习的对象。
    即令退后一步从中国水墨画的技术来考察，例如齐白石的动物和花草，笔墨简到无可再简，不只表现了对象的体、形、质、动态和精神，而且容易了解画家对于这些生意盎然的生物的爱。这些笔墨具有书法趣味而又是形象富于概括作用和表现力的中国画特有的技术是很可宝贵的。不是任何复杂化都是提高，由繁琐到单纯，也是一种提高。为什么一定要说笔墨洗练而内容丰富的中国画是落后的、不科学的，必须用西洋画技术来代替的？
    否定传统的中国绘画有其独特的造型基础，根本不看重构成中国画特点的笔墨的技术，为了打击中国画不惜硬说某些油画具备中国画的特色，实在是不要传统技术的胡说。
    污蔑“文化部只要传统，不要革命”的江丰，已经堕落到蜕化叛党的程度。参加批判他的会议的美术家揭发了许多罪恶，对他各种反党的卑鄙手段作了严厉的批评。我完全同意这种批评，这篇文章不过是有关文艺路线问题的意见的一些补充。为了保证党在文艺领域中的领导，为了我们自己的思想改造和提高，对江丰还要继续进行批判。
