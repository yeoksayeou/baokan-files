Standpoint Is Not Abstract
　　Lú Xiànzhí

　　In this year's political and ideological assessment of graduates, many students' self-criticisms state that they have a "firm standpoint." Even rightists describe themselves as "standing on the proletarian standpoint," merely claiming to have "low ideological awareness" or "biased emotions." No matter how beautifully they decorate themselves or how eloquently they speak, they cannot hide from the eyes of the masses. Once their thoughts and actions are laid bare, they have no choice but to conclude: "My standpoint is unstable," "I am still standing on the landlord and bourgeois standpoint."

　　Indeed, the standpoint of most students is relatively firm. They safeguard the interests of the Party and insist on taking the socialist road. However, the standpoint of some students is wavering, while others fundamentally stand on the original landlord and bourgeois standpoint.

　　Standpoint is by no means an abstract thing. The firmness or instability of one's standpoint depends on one's consistent thoughts and actions. Each political movement is a touchstone for examining one's standpoint.

　　Those who are anti-communist and anti-socialist are, of course, rightists. However, those who are often indifferent to politics, remain silent during various movements, and, during this blooming and contending process, find the rightists' arguments to be "reasonable," thereby creating a resonance, cannot be called rightists, but one cannot say that their standpoint is firm! Usually, there is this phenomenon: When a person is distorted, slandered, or insulted by another, he will stand up and vehemently argue, defending himself, and counterattacking others with an air of not resting until complete victory is achieved. But when rightists slander and insult the Communist Party, even calling for the Communist Party to step down and wanting to drag China onto the capitalist road, why are you indifferent? Why even resonate? Is this a manifestation of your firm proletarian standpoint? Without establishing proletarian thought, one can never firmly stand on the proletarian standpoint. If you want to know whether you have firmly stood on the proletarian standpoint, you must examine whether you have established proletarian thought, and examine whether your daily thoughts and actions are in line with the interests of the Party and the socialist road. A person who holds a negative attitude towards the Party and the socialist cause, and is indifferent to it, his thought is definitely not proletarian thought. He cannot possibly stand firmly on the proletarian standpoint. (Selected from the Northwest Agricultural College Journal)

　　立场并不是抽象的
　　卢宪植
    在这次毕业生的政治思想鉴定中，许多学生的自我检查都是“立场坚定”，右派分子也自称为“站在无产阶级立场上”，把自己说成什么“思想觉悟不高”，或者说自己“具有偏激情绪”等就算了事。不管他把自己装饰得多么好看，说得多么好听，但大家的眼睛总是隐瞒不过的，当大家把他的思想言行摊开来之后，自己就不得不下结论：“我的立场不稳”，“我还站在地主资产阶级的立场”。
    的确大部分学生的立场是较坚定的，他们维护党的利益，坚持走社会主义道路。但有一部分学生的立场是动摇不定的，而有的则根本站在原来的地主、资产阶级立场。
    立场决不是什么抽象的东西，立场的坚定与不坚定，要看你经常的思想和行动，每次政治运动就是检查立场的试金石。
    反共反社会主义的人，当然是右派分子。然而经常对政治漠不关心，对各次运动表示沉默寡言，在这次鸣放过程中对右派的言论认为“言之有理”，起了共鸣作用的人，虽不能说是右派分子，但总不能说这种立场是坚定的吧！平常有这种现象：当一个人被另一个人歪曲、诬蔑或辱骂时，他就会挺身而出，气不可遏地辩驳，维护自己，反击他人，大有不得全胜，决不收兵的气势。但当右派分子诬蔑和辱骂共产党甚至要叫共产党下台，要把中国拉上资本主义道路的时候，你为什么漠不关心？甚而共鸣呢？这难道是自己无产阶级立场坚定的表现吗？没有树立起无产阶级的思想，决不会站稳无产阶级的立场，你如果想知道自己站稳了无产阶级立场没有，你就要检查有没有树立无产阶级的思想，检查你日常的思想言行，是否与党的利益和社会主义道路相吻合。一个对党、对社会主义事业，抱消极态度、漠不关心的人，他的思想绝不是无产阶级思想。他也不可能站稳了无产阶级立场。（选自西北农学院院刊）
