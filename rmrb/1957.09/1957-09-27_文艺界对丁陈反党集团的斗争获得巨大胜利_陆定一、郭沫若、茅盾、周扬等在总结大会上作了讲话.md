The struggle against the Ding Ling and Chen Qixia anti-Party clique by the Party Group of the Chinese Writers Association held a summary meeting on September 16th and 17th. In addition to the heads of writers, literary and art organizations, and groups in Beijing, the main heads of local branches of the Chinese Writers Association, some writers, and responsible cadres from the Propaganda Departments of the CPC Provincial and Municipal Committees, totaling more than 1,350 people, attended the meeting. Lu Dingyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, and Deputy Minister Zhou Yang, spoke at the meeting. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, Vice-Chairmen Ba Jin and Lao She, and others also spoke at the meeting. Shao Quanlin, Secretary of the Party Group of the Writers Association, made a summary speech on behalf of the Party Group regarding the struggle against the Ding and Chen anti-Party clique in the literary and art circles.

    The Revolution on the Political and Ideological Fronts is a Long-Term One

Lu Dingyi clarified the important significance of this anti-rightist struggle at the meeting. He said: China's democratic revolution took a long time and many bloody struggles to achieve victory. The socialist revolution is a more profound and extensive revolution than the democratic revolution. The socialist revolution aims to eliminate the capitalist system of exploitation, completely end thousands of years of history of exploitation of man by man, and ensure that all systems of exploitation can never arise again. In our country, this revolution has been very short. The people's regime led by the working class of our country was established in 1949, which is only eight years ago. It has only been four years since the Party put forward the general line in 1953. We have completed the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. The economic base of our country has undergone fundamental changes, and the problem of ownership of the means of production has been solved. The current struggle against bourgeois rightists is a socialist revolution in politics and ideology. He said that even after the issues of political power and ownership of the means of production have been resolved, there will still be fierce struggles on the political and ideological fronts. This kind of fierce struggle in politics and ideology is not unique to our country. Historically, many socialist countries have had to go through such a struggle. The Soviet Union had it, which was the struggle against the Trotskyist faction; Hungary also had it, which was the counter-revolutionary event in October last year. Trotsky was a bourgeois intellectual, and the leading figures in Hungary's Pet≈ëfi Club were also bourgeois intellectuals. He said that after the issue of political power has been resolved and the socialist revolution on the economic front has been basically completed, the bourgeoisie will still rebel. Leading this rebellion are the bourgeois intellectuals. This kind of bourgeois rebellion failed in the Soviet Union. In Hungary, the working class regime was once usurped by the bourgeoisie, but in the end, the bourgeoisie also failed. The rampant attack by the bourgeois rightists in China, centered on the Zhang-Luo alliance, is an attempt to rebel against socialism. He said that whether in the Soviet Union, Hungary, or China, the purpose of the bourgeois rebellion is to overthrow the socialist system and restore the reactionary rule of counter-revolution.

Lu Dingyi pointed out that the revolution on the political and ideological fronts cannot be resolved all at once. From now on, it will take another ten or fifteen years to basically complete. This is a long-term and serious class struggle. This kind of struggle will continue even after ten or fifteen years. As long as imperialism and the bourgeoisie exist in the world, the class struggle in politics and ideology will not cease.

    Under the Socialist System, a Large Number of Working-Class Intellectuals Can Be Cultivated, Bourgeois Intellectuals Can Be Transformed, and a Portion of Intellectuals with Bourgeois Consciousness May Also Emerge

Lu Dingyi pointed out that under the socialist system, a large number of working-class intellectuals can be cultivated, and bourgeois intellectuals can be transformed, which is beyond doubt. However, it is also possible to produce a portion of intellectuals with bourgeois consciousness. He said that we can transform bourgeois intellectuals, but some bourgeois intellectuals are very difficult to transform, and some are even unwilling to transform until their death. They are bourgeois rightists, they hate socialism, and they have irreconcilable contradictions with the Communist Party and the people. Some people have joined the Communist Party organizationally, but even the long-term education of the Communist Party has not been able to transform them. Feng Xuefeng and Ding Ling are such examples.

He said that from this anti-rightist struggle, we also see that in socialist society, new intellectuals with bourgeois consciousness will also emerge, such as Zeng Yansiu, Zhong Dianfei, Chen Yong, Liu Shaotang, Liu Binyan, Guo Wei, etc. Some of them went to the revolutionary base areas at a very young age and grew up there, and some of them grew up only after the national liberation. They were educated in socialist society, but they became bourgeois rightists.

Why do intellectuals with bourgeois consciousness still emerge in socialist society? Lu Dingyi said that one reason is that consciousness often lags behind existence. Intellectuals in the old society who only had democratic ideas, without undergoing ideological transformation, cannot keep up with the socialist reality in their thinking, and will go from disliking the socialist system to hating the socialist system. The second reason is the influence of domestic and foreign bourgeois ideology, which will continue to exist for a long time. The third reason is that in socialist society, the problem of distribution of means of livelihood still contains "bourgeois rights," and it cannot be distributed according to needs, but only according to labor, according to the principle of equal exchange of commodities.

Lu Dingyi said that the "equality" in capitalist society is "the equality of millionaires and the poor before the law," which is false equality. "Millionaires" control the means of production, and the poor do not have the means of production and can only be exploited and oppressed by "millionaires." Where can there be any equality? In socialist society, the system of public ownership and collective ownership of the means of production is implemented, and no one can privately own the means of production to exploit others. This has undergone a fundamental change.

However, compared with communist society, there is still inequality in socialist society. That is, in the distribution of means of livelihood, there is still a remnant of inequality. The principle of socialist society is "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work." Since remuneration is based on labor, there is inequality. Those with strong labor power will have more income, and those with weak labor power will have less income. In a family, if there are many people and few labor forces, the income per person will be less; if there are few people and many labor forces, the income per person will be more. In the "Critique of the Gotha Program," Marx said that in socialist society, "equal rights are still limited by the bourgeois horizon in one aspect," which refers to the inequality in the distribution of means of livelihood. Although in our socialist society, there are various ways to help and relieve people with too little income, inequality will still exist to a certain extent. Only when the social productive forces have greatly developed, and when we reach communist society, and implement the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs," and distribute the means of livelihood according to needs, will these differences be eliminated.

Lu Dingyi said that our country has now entered socialist society, but the bourgeoisie has not been completely eliminated, because capitalists still receive fixed interest. Fixed interest is a kind of exploitation. Now the state has to spend 110 million yuan every year to pay this fixed interest. This method of fixed interest will end in 1962. He said that since socialist society has realized the socialist ownership of the means of production, and at the same time there is still a certain degree of inequality in the distribution of means of livelihood, this inequality is the material basis for the generation of bourgeois ideology. The vast majority of people agree with from each according to his ability, to each according to his work; but a few people demand less work and more pay, and even no work and no pay; and communists are willing to work more and get less, so that social productivity can develop faster and mankind can enter communist society faster. Therefore, on the one hand, there is the working class's selfless and wholehearted service to the people, and on the other hand, there is the selfish and self-interested bourgeois ideology. There is a long-term struggle between the two. Precisely because of this reason, socialist society will not only produce a large number of working-class intellectuals, but also produce a part of intellectuals with bourgeois consciousness. Not only will there be many communists, and a large number of labor models, advanced workers, and other advanced figures and model examples, but there will also be hooligans, ruffians, corruption, theft and other kinds of bad people and bad things.

    The Bad Practice of Indiscriminately Praising Writers and Young Literary and Art Workers Should Be Completely Changed

Lu Dingyi said that it is inevitable that some of the intellectuals cultivated in socialist society will degenerate into intellectuals with bourgeois consciousness. However, if we do our work well, we can reduce this phenomenon to a minimum. Therefore, we must learn from past experiences and lessons. He pointed out that in recent years, a bad atmosphere of indiscriminately praising writers and young literary and art workers has emerged in society, which has fueled the bourgeois ideas and styles of some people. He said that praise should arouse the aversion and disgust of the praised, but some young writers have become proud because of this, thinking that they are amazing "genius writers," looking down on the working masses, looking down on old writers, looking down on the Party, and putting on the airs of great writers. Some have a lot of royalties, live in big cities, are unwilling to go to the working masses, their lives are corrupt and degenerate, and politically they have degenerated into bourgeois rightists. In the future, the relevant leaders should learn from the lessons and completely eliminate this bad atmosphere of praise, otherwise, it will continue to harm people.

    The Struggle Between the Two Lines in Literary and Art Work

Regarding the struggle between the two lines in literary and art work, Lu Dingyi said that this has been going on for a long time. Since the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art in 1942, this struggle has never stopped. The fundamental difference between the two lines is the relationship between politics and literature and art, and the relationship between the Party and literature and art. Our Party has always advocated political leadership of literature and art, so literature and art should be led by the Party and should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Therefore, literary and art workers should study Marxism and closely integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. We should unite and educate all literary and art workers who can be united, establish a broad united front of literature and art, and serve the revolution. We regard revolutionary literary and art work as an indispensable part of the entire revolutionary cause. However, from Wang Shiwei to Hu Feng, to Feng Xuefeng, Ding Ling, Jiang Feng, etc., they advocate literature and art first, and politics should be subordinate to literature and art; "artists should lead politicians" should be implemented, or literature and art should become an independent kingdom. They refuse to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers; they do not want a united front, they overthrow everything, and they are self-righteous. This is an anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist literary and art line. He said that the struggle between these two lines has existed for a long time in the past, and there will be struggles in the future. Don't think that the struggle has ended. But this struggle is very important and has great significance for the future development of literary and art work. It will greatly consolidate the Party's leadership over literary and art work.

    Soul Engineers Should First Transform Their Own Souls

Lu Dingyi pointed out that all classes have their own soul engineers. There are slave owners, feudal lords, bourgeois, and working-class soul engineers. For the working class, the title of "soul engineer" is to urge writers to strive for progress, not to make writers proud and complacent. Lu Dingyi said that it is more scientific to say that literary and art workers are part of soul engineers than to say that literary and art workers are soul engineers. Because educators, teachers of Marxism, Party and Communist Youth League workers are also soul engineers. Young Pioneers instructors and nursery school caregivers are also doing educational work. Literary and art workers are just one type of soul engineer, but an important one. All those who educate others can be called soul engineers. However, all those who educate others should be educated, and be primary school students of the people, before they can be teachers, and literary and art workers are no exception. Soul engineers should first transform their own souls. If literary and art workers do not strive to transform their own souls and turn themselves into working-class literary and art workers, they may degenerate into soul termites. He pointed out that the occupation of a writer, like the sentry on the front line of the battlefield, is glorious and dangerous, and easily captured by the enemy. Because the working method of literary and art workers is a handicraft method, it is easy to generate individualism and liberalism; writers are also easy to become famous, and once they become famous, they are easy to become proud and complacent, and become prisoners of bourgeois ideology. He pointed out that writers should thoroughly transform their thinking, put "I" under the collective, and put the masses of the people and the cause of the Party in the most sublime position.

    Writers Should Go to the Masses of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers for a Long Time, Unconditionally, and Wholeheartedly

Lu Dingyi pointed out that the slogan "experience life" has its advantages, but also has its extremely bad points. It is beneficial to writers who did not have the opportunity to contact workers, peasants, and soldiers under the reactionary rule in the past, so that they can get closer to the workers, peasants, and soldiers. But for writers who have always lived in revolutionary base areas and for young writers, it has already had a bad effect. Because they have already, or could have lived among the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, the slogan "experience life" has instead objectively prevented them from doing so. Some young people with aspirations for literature and art, after living among workers, peasants, and soldiers for a few years and writing some better works, are placed in "creative groups" that are divorced from the masses, and become so-called "professional writers" too early, so they are divorced from life, live in big cities, occasionally go to the countryside to "experience life", gradually leave the only source of creation, and can no longer write anything decent, or even begin to degenerate. The example of Liu Shaotang should especially arouse our vigilance. He believes that writers should not only occasionally go to "experience life", but should, according to the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong: "Must go to the masses of workers and peasants for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly." It is best to participate in labor, and secondly to participate in grassroots work. We must share the same destiny and share the same joys and sorrows with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Of course, elderly and frail old writers should be given appropriate arrangements, but do not shake our fundamental principles because of this. In order to set an example for young people, it is hoped that old writers will implement what Comrade Mao Zedong said at the National Propaganda Work Conference in April this year, that 70% of them can go to factories and rural areas in batches within eleven years, either "take a fleeting glance" or "take a closer look" or settle down for a few years. Writers living in big cities should approach the masses by taking on part-time jobs or other methods whenever possible.

    Socialist Realism is Not the Only Method of Creation, But It is the Best Method of Creation

Regarding socialist realism, Lu Dingyi gave an explanation. He believes that what Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Chinese revolutionary writers and artists, promising writers and artists, must go to the masses, must go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly, to the fiery struggle, to the only, the broadest and richest source, to observe, experience, study, and analyze all people, all classes, all the masses, all vivid forms of life and forms of struggle, all the raw materials of literature and art, and then it is possible to enter the creative process." This passage is the basis of the method of socialist realism. He said that we advocate "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend," allowing various creative methods, various themes, and various styles of works to compete freely. We believe that socialist realism is not the only method of creation, but at the same time, we believe that socialist realism is the best method of creation. He pointed out that those who are high above and do not go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, no matter how they verbally say that they agree with socialist realism, cannot write socialist realist works. To write socialist realist works, one must first "go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly."

Lu Dingyi said that Comrade Mao Zedong told us to "observe, experience, study, and analyze all people, all classes, all the masses, all vivid forms of life and forms of struggle, all the raw materials of literature and art." There are five "all" here. He believes that the reason why some works have the problem of formulaic conceptualization is not, as Hu Feng said, because the writers went to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, but on the contrary, because the writers' understanding of the life of workers, peasants, and soldiers is not comprehensive, and they did not observe, experience, study, and analyze the five "all" that Comrade Mao Zedong said. We should overcome formulaization and conceptualization according to Comrade Mao Zedong's words.

Lu Dingyi also emphasized the issue of whether we can criticize the errors and shortcomings in our work. He said that since it is socialist realism, of course we must write about difficulties, errors, and shortcomings, and also write about the overcoming of difficulties and errors. In the end, the achievements are still the main thing, and the errors and shortcomings are still secondary. Things that ultimately failed can also be written, from which experience can be gained.

    It is Hoped that Writers Will Conduct Long-Term and Whole-Process Observation and Research on the Construction of Factories, Agricultural Cooperatives, Schools, and Stores From Beginning to End

Lu Dingyi made two specific hopes for literary and artists: First, I hope that our writers will conduct observations and research on the construction of our country's factories, agricultural cooperatives, schools, and stores, from beginning to end, for a long time, and in the whole process. If you look at one of each of the four things, you can have a basic understanding of our social outlook. With this basic understanding, it will be easier to have correct views on other things. Second, Party member writers should be incorporated into the Party's grassroots organizations in production units or urban streets to live the life of the Party.

Finally, he proposed to severely criticize the rightists, severely improve work, and severely transform thinking.

    Throw Away the "Burden" of Individualism and Become a Firm Communist Fighter

In his speech, Zhou Yang pointed out that the anti-rightist struggle in the literary and art circles in the past two or three months is a struggle to defend the socialist literary and art line and purify the Party's literary and art team. This struggle has achieved a major victory, but it has also gained serious lessons. Why have old Party members and old writers like Ding Ling, Feng Xuefeng, and Jiang Feng degenerated into the quagmire of anti-Party? He said that as early as 1930, Lu Xun pointed out in his speech at the founding meeting of the League of Left-Wing Writers: If left-wing writers are divorced from actual struggle, if they regard themselves as higher than everything, and regard their work as more noble than all work, then it is easy to become right-wing writers. Lu Xun's words are very correct. Today, it is still worth our vigilance. Zhou Yang said that in our revolutionary literary and art team, many people are from families of exploiting classes and have received bourgeois education. Many people joined the revolution carrying the "burden" of bourgeois individualism. Some people, in the course of revolutionary struggle, gradually threw away the "burden" of individualism, transformed themselves into collective fighters, felt free and light in the revolutionary team, and were of one heart with the Party. The other kind of people have always carried the "burden" of individualism and cannot let go of personal gains and losses and personal grudges; they take credit to the Party for a little achievement, and are dissatisfied with the Party when they encounter a little setback, so they not only cannot throw away the "burden" that hinders their progress, but also increase the weight of the "burden." The stronger the Party and the revolutionary forces, the more "unfree" they feel, and the more incompatible they feel. They are not centripetal to the Party, but centrifugal. When they encounter an important juncture, they cannot withstand the test, and finally embark on the road of anti-Party and even betraying the Party. Now we have to pass the socialist barrier, and the Party's writers should strive to be firm communist fighters and not degenerate into individualistic careerists.

Zhou Yang pointed out that the criticism of the one-bookism is a major issue concerning the use of the communist worldview or the bourgeois individualistic ideology to cultivate young writers. We advocate that writers should serve the people wholeheartedly with their creations. Writing a book, painting a picture, directing a film, and thinking that you are amazing, and thinking that you can bargain with the Party from now on, or even stand on an equal footing with the Party, is an extremely bad manifestation of the bourgeois individualistic worldview. They forget that their reputation and status are given to them by the Party and the people, and therefore can also be taken back from them.

    The Fundamental Difference Between Us and the Bourgeois Rightists in the Literary and Art Circles

Zhou Yang also pointed out that the fundamental difference between the bourgeois rightists in the literary and art circles and us is whether literature and art should serve revolutionary politics? Should it be led by the Party? He said that this difference has existed for a long time. During the Left League period, left-wing writers led by Lu Xun fought against open bourgeois literary factions; later, we continuously fought against the Hu Feng clique, which was hidden in the left-wing literary team and wore the cloak of Marxism to undermine the revolutionary literary movement; now, we are fighting against the anti-Marxist revisionist literary and art line of Feng Xuefeng and others. The rightists and revisionists in the literary and art circles attack socialist literature and art, and their purpose is to negate the socialist system. They do not openly and publicly attack socialist literature and art; they take a aristocratic contemptuous attitude to belittle or obliterate the achievements of socialist literature and art, and slander socialist literary and artistic works as "unreal." They insist that under the socialist system, writers do not have creative freedom, so they have to "tell lies" in their works.

Zhou Yang said that socialist literature is still very young. Soviet literature, counting from Gorky's "Mother", is only fifty years old, and Chinese new literature, counting from the "May Fourth" Movement, is only thirty or forty years old. Compared with thousands of years of feudal literature and hundreds of years of capitalist literature, such young literature will of course have its immature aspects. But socialist literature, compared with the literature of any era in the past, is unprecedented. It is based on the Marxist-Leninist worldview, developed in close contact with the class struggle of the working people, and consciously serves the interests of the working people. Our literature today is not yet mature and has shortcomings, but we must cherish it, support it, and gradually overcome its shortcomings in the process of development. We must believe that our society will surely produce great works.

Regarding the issue of "truth," Zhou Yang said that artistic works, of course, must be true. The difference between us and the rightists is: What is the purpose of writing the truth? The bourgeois rightists and revisionists believe that as soon as literature has a purpose, it is not true. In fact, advocating that literary creation has no purpose is also a purpose. Their purpose is to make literature not serve the socialist revolution. They believe that only writing about the so-called dark side of our society is writing the "truth," and writing about the bright things in our society is "telling lies." Obviously, people standing on different positions have different views on what is "true." The purpose of our literary creation is to encourage people to dedicate themselves to the great cause of socialist revolution, not to make people pessimistic and disappointed and lose confidence in the revolution.

Regarding the issue of creative freedom, Zhou Yang said that people who write for the anti-Party and anti-socialist are not free. For people who write for the interests of the people, there is the greatest freedom in our society. Our writers have full freedom in the selection of materials, the method of expression, and the artistic style.

Regarding the issue of how to improve literary and art work in the future, Zhou Yang believes that we should continue to launch a great debate on literary and art ideology, adhere to the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," adhere to the principle of free competition in literature and art, and prevent crude and simplistic methods. The most important thing at present is to completely solve the problem of the combination of writers, artists, and the masses of workers and peasants. He said that writers must go to factories and rural areas to participate in grassroots work and labor. Only in this way can they truly become one with the masses of workers and peasants, obtain rich artistic feelings, and write good works. Young writers should not specialize too early. The long-term combination of writers and workers and peasants in labor and struggle should become the fundamental system of our literary and art work. Finally, he said that the socialist literary and art cause can only develop under the leadership of the Party. The individual labor of writers should be well combined with the collective cause.

In his speech, Guo Moruo pointed out that the anti-rightist struggle in the literary and art circles is an important front in the entire anti-rightist struggle. The victory of the struggle in the literary and art circles can not only purify the literary and art team and consolidate the Party's leadership over literary and art, but also encourage the battles of all sectors of the country, so that socialist education can be more popular and more in-depth. He said that we must insist on continuing the struggle, strive for a thorough victory, so that every one of our literary and art circles can become proletarian intellectuals; we must work hard to transform ourselves and become proletarian cultural workers.

Mao Dun analyzed several common points of the rightists inside and outside the Party at the meeting: under the guise of anti-dogmatism, they peddle bourgeois private goods; they negate the achievements of the literary and art work led by the Party; they oppose the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and oppose literature and art serving politics; they oppose ideological transformation. Mao Dun refuted the wrong arguments of the rightists on these issues, and pointed out that Feng Xuefeng's literary and artistic thought is revisionist thought.

Ba Jin and Lao She unanimously condemned the anti-Party words and deeds of Ding Ling, Feng Xuefeng, and others. They believe that they must learn from this struggle, thoroughly eliminate the bad influence caused by the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique in the literary and art circles, and resolutely oppose the bourgeois ideology and style existing in the literary and art circles.

In his summary speech, Shao Quanlin said: This expanded meeting of the Party Group of the Writers Association to criticize the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique started on June 6 and lasted until September 17, lasting nearly three and a half months. A total of 27 meetings were held, and more than 140 comrades inside and outside the Party spoke at the meeting, unanimously exposing and criticizing the words and deeds of the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique. He pointed out that this struggle is a continuation of the Party's struggle against the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique in 1955. The nature of the struggle is the struggle between the Party's literary and art line and the anti-Party literary and art line; it is the struggle between Marxist literary and artistic thought and anti-Marxist literary and artistic thought; it is the struggle to consolidate the Party's leadership and defend the Party's unity and purity. He said: Although the discussion of the conference has come to a temporary end, the struggle has not ended. The struggle has achieved a great victory, but it is still a preliminary victory. It must be deepened further and further, continue to criticize the anti-Party words and deeds of Ding Ling and others, and completely eliminate the poison and influence they have caused in the literary and art circles.
