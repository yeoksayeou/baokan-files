The struggle against the Ding Ling and Chen Qixia anti-Party clique by the Party Group of the Chinese Writers Association held a summary meeting on September 16th and 17th. In addition to the heads of writers, literary and art organizations, and groups in Beijing, the main heads of local branches of the Chinese Writers Association, some writers, and responsible cadres from the Propaganda Departments of the CPC Provincial and Municipal Committees, totaling more than 1,350 people, attended the meeting. Lu Dingyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, and Deputy Minister Zhou Yang, spoke at the meeting. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, Vice-Chairmen Ba Jin and Lao She, and others also spoke at the meeting. Shao Quanlin, Secretary of the Party Group of the Writers Association, made a summary speech on behalf of the Party Group regarding the struggle against the Ding and Chen anti-Party clique in the literary and art circles.

    The Revolution on the Political and Ideological Fronts is a Long-Term One

Lu Dingyi clarified the important significance of this anti-rightist struggle at the meeting. He said: China's democratic revolution took a long time and many bloody struggles to achieve victory. The socialist revolution is a more profound and extensive revolution than the democratic revolution. The socialist revolution aims to eliminate the capitalist system of exploitation, completely end thousands of years of history of exploitation of man by man, and ensure that all systems of exploitation can never arise again. In our country, this revolution has been very short. The people's regime led by the working class of our country was established in 1949, which is only eight years ago. It has only been four years since the Party put forward the general line in 1953. We have completed the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. The economic base of our country has undergone fundamental changes, and the problem of ownership of the means of production has been solved. The current struggle against bourgeois rightists is a socialist revolution in politics and ideology. He said that even after the issues of political power and ownership of the means of production have been resolved, there will still be fierce struggles on the political and ideological fronts. This kind of fierce struggle in politics and ideology is not unique to our country. Historically, many socialist countries have had to go through such a struggle. The Soviet Union had it, which was the struggle against the Trotskyist faction; Hungary also had it, which was the counter-revolutionary event in October last year. Trotsky was a bourgeois intellectual, and the leading figures in Hungary's Petőfi Club were also bourgeois intellectuals. He said that after the issue of political power has been resolved and the socialist revolution on the economic front has been basically completed, the bourgeoisie will still rebel. Leading this rebellion are the bourgeois intellectuals. This kind of bourgeois rebellion failed in the Soviet Union. In Hungary, the working class regime was once usurped by the bourgeoisie, but in the end, the bourgeoisie also failed. The rampant attack by the bourgeois rightists in China, centered on the Zhang-Luo alliance, is an attempt to rebel against socialism. He said that whether in the Soviet Union, Hungary, or China, the purpose of the bourgeois rebellion is to overthrow the socialist system and restore the reactionary rule of counter-revolution.

Lu Dingyi pointed out that the revolution on the political and ideological fronts cannot be resolved all at once. From now on, it will take another ten or fifteen years to basically complete. This is a long-term and serious class struggle. This kind of struggle will continue even after ten or fifteen years. As long as imperialism and the bourgeoisie exist in the world, the class struggle in politics and ideology will not cease.

    Under the Socialist System, a Large Number of Working-Class Intellectuals Can Be Cultivated, Bourgeois Intellectuals Can Be Transformed, and a Portion of Intellectuals with Bourgeois Consciousness May Also Emerge

Lu Dingyi pointed out that under the socialist system, a large number of working-class intellectuals can be cultivated, and bourgeois intellectuals can be transformed, which is beyond doubt. However, it is also possible to produce a portion of intellectuals with bourgeois consciousness. He said that we can transform bourgeois intellectuals, but some bourgeois intellectuals are very difficult to transform, and some are even unwilling to transform until their death. They are bourgeois rightists, they hate socialism, and they have irreconcilable contradictions with the Communist Party and the people. Some people have joined the Communist Party organizationally, but even the long-term education of the Communist Party has not been able to transform them. Feng Xuefeng and Ding Ling are such examples.

He said that from this anti-rightist struggle, we also see that in socialist society, new intellectuals with bourgeois consciousness will also emerge, such as Zeng Yansiu, Zhong Dianfei, Chen Yong, Liu Shaotang, Liu Binyan, Guo Wei, etc. Some of them went to the revolutionary base areas at a very young age and grew up there, and some of them grew up only after the national liberation. They were educated in socialist society, but they became bourgeois rightists.

Why do intellectuals with bourgeois consciousness still emerge in socialist society? Lu Dingyi said that one reason is that consciousness often lags behind existence. Intellectuals in the old society who only had democratic ideas, without undergoing ideological transformation, cannot keep up with the socialist reality in their thinking, and will go from disliking the socialist system to hating the socialist system. The second reason is the influence of domestic and foreign bourgeois ideology, which will continue to exist for a long time. The third reason is that in socialist society, the problem of distribution of means of livelihood still contains "bourgeois rights," and it cannot be distributed according to needs, but only according to labor, according to the principle of equal exchange of commodities.

Lu Dingyi said that the "equality" in capitalist society is "the equality of millionaires and the poor before the law," which is false equality. "Millionaires" control the means of production, and the poor do not have the means of production and can only be exploited and oppressed by "millionaires." Where can there be any equality? In socialist society, the system of public ownership and collective ownership of the means of production is implemented, and no one can privately own the means of production to exploit others. This has undergone a fundamental change.

However, compared with communist society, there is still inequality in socialist society. That is, in the distribution of means of livelihood, there is still a remnant of inequality. The principle of socialist society is "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work." Since remuneration is based on labor, there is inequality. Those with strong labor power will have more income, and those with weak labor power will have less income. In a family, if there are many people and few labor forces, the income per person will be less; if there are few people and many labor forces, the income per person will be more. In the "Critique of the Gotha Program," Marx said that in socialist society, "equal rights are still limited by the bourgeois horizon in one aspect," which refers to the inequality in the distribution of means of livelihood. Although in our socialist society, there are various ways to help and relieve people with too little income, inequality will still exist to a certain extent. Only when the social productive forces have greatly developed, and when we reach communist society, and implement the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs," and distribute the means of livelihood according to needs, will these differences be eliminated.

Lu Dingyi said that our country has now entered socialist society, but the bourgeoisie has not been completely eliminated, because capitalists still receive fixed interest. Fixed interest is a kind of exploitation. Now the state has to spend 110 million yuan every year to pay this fixed interest. This method of fixed interest will end in 1962. He said that since socialist society has realized the socialist ownership of the means of production, and at the same time there is still a certain degree of inequality in the distribution of means of livelihood, this inequality is the material basis for the generation of bourgeois ideology. The vast majority of people agree with from each according to his ability, to each according to his work; but a few people demand less work and more pay, and even no work and no pay; and communists are willing to work more and get less, so that social productivity can develop faster and mankind can enter communist society faster. Therefore, on the one hand, there is the working class's selfless and wholehearted service to the people, and on the other hand, there is the selfish and self-interested bourgeois ideology. There is a long-term struggle between the two. Precisely because of this reason, socialist society will not only produce a large number of working-class intellectuals, but also produce a part of intellectuals with bourgeois consciousness. Not only will there be many communists, and a large number of labor models, advanced workers, and other advanced figures and model examples, but there will also be hooligans, ruffians, corruption, theft and other kinds of bad people and bad things.

    The Bad Practice of Indiscriminately Praising Writers and Young Literary and Art Workers Should Be Completely Changed

Lu Dingyi said that it is inevitable that some of the intellectuals cultivated in socialist society will degenerate into intellectuals with bourgeois consciousness. However, if we do our work well, we can reduce this phenomenon to a minimum. Therefore, we must learn from past experiences and lessons. He pointed out that in recent years, a bad atmosphere of indiscriminately praising writers and young literary and art workers has emerged in society, which has fueled the bourgeois ideas and styles of some people. He said that praise should arouse the aversion and disgust of the praised, but some young writers have become proud because of this, thinking that they are amazing "genius writers," looking down on the working masses, looking down on old writers, looking down on the Party, and putting on the airs of great writers. Some have a lot of royalties, live in big cities, are unwilling to go to the working masses, their lives are corrupt and degenerate, and politically they have degenerated into bourgeois rightists. In the future, the relevant leaders should learn from the lessons and completely eliminate this bad atmosphere of praise, otherwise, it will continue to harm people.

    The Struggle Between the Two Lines in Literary and Art Work

Regarding the struggle between the two lines in literary and art work, Lu Dingyi said that this has been going on for a long time. Since the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art in 1942, this struggle has never stopped. The fundamental difference between the two lines is the relationship between politics and literature and art, and the relationship between the Party and literature and art. Our Party has always advocated political leadership of literature and art, so literature and art should be led by the Party and should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Therefore, literary and art workers should study Marxism and closely integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. We should unite and educate all literary and art workers who can be united, establish a broad united front of literature and art, and serve the revolution. We regard revolutionary literary and art work as an indispensable part of the entire revolutionary cause. However, from Wang Shiwei to Hu Feng, to Feng Xuefeng, Ding Ling, Jiang Feng, etc., they advocate literature and art first, and politics should be subordinate to literature and art; "artists should lead politicians" should be implemented, or literature and art should become an independent kingdom. They refuse to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers; they do not want a united front, they overthrow everything, and they are self-righteous. This is an anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist literary and art line. He said that the struggle between these two lines has existed for a long time in the past, and there will be struggles in the future. Don't think that the struggle has ended. But this struggle is very important and has great significance for the future development of literary and art work. It will greatly consolidate the Party's leadership over literary and art work.

    Soul Engineers Should First Transform Their Own Souls

Lu Dingyi pointed out that all classes have their own soul engineers. There are slave owners, feudal lords, bourgeois, and working-class soul engineers. For the working class, the title of "soul engineer" is to urge writers to strive for progress, not to make writers proud and complacent. Lu Dingyi said that it is more scientific to say that literary and art workers are part of soul engineers than to say that literary and art workers are soul engineers. Because educators, teachers of Marxism, Party and Communist Youth League workers are also soul engineers. Young Pioneers instructors and nursery school caregivers are also doing educational work. Literary and art workers are just one type of soul engineer, but an important one. All those who educate others can be called soul engineers. However, all those who educate others should be educated, and be primary school students of the people, before they can be teachers, and literary and art workers are no exception. Soul engineers should first transform their own souls. If literary and art workers do not strive to transform their own souls and turn themselves into working-class literary and art workers, they may degenerate into soul termites. He pointed out that the occupation of a writer, like the sentry on the front line of the battlefield, is glorious and dangerous, and easily captured by the enemy. Because the working method of literary and art workers is a handicraft method, it is easy to generate individualism and liberalism; writers are also easy to become famous, and once they become famous, they are easy to become proud and complacent, and become prisoners of bourgeois ideology. He pointed out that writers should thoroughly transform their thinking, put "I" under the collective, and put the masses of the people and the cause of the Party in the most sublime position.

    Writers Should Go to the Masses of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers for a Long Time, Unconditionally, and Wholeheartedly

Lu Dingyi pointed out that the slogan "experience life" has its advantages, but also has its extremely bad points. It is beneficial to writers who did not have the opportunity to contact workers, peasants, and soldiers under the reactionary rule in the past, so that they can get closer to the workers, peasants, and soldiers. But for writers who have always lived in revolutionary base areas and for young writers, it has already had a bad effect. Because they have already, or could have lived among the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, the slogan "experience life" has instead objectively prevented them from doing so. Some young people with aspirations for literature and art, after living among workers, peasants, and soldiers for a few years and writing some better works, are placed in "creative groups" that are divorced from the masses, and become so-called "professional writers" too early, so they are divorced from life, live in big cities, occasionally go to the countryside to "experience life", gradually leave the only source of creation, and can no longer write anything decent, or even begin to degenerate. The example of Liu Shaotang should especially arouse our vigilance. He believes that writers should not only occasionally go to "experience life", but should, according to the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong: "Must go to the masses of workers and peasants for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly." It is best to participate in labor, and secondly to participate in grassroots work. We must share the same destiny and share the same joys and sorrows with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Of course, elderly and frail old writers should be given appropriate arrangements, but do not shake our fundamental principles because of this. In order to set an example for young people, it is hoped that old writers will implement what Comrade Mao Zedong said at the National Propaganda Work Conference in April this year, that 70% of them can go to factories and rural areas in batches within eleven years, either "take a fleeting glance" or "take a closer look" or settle down for a few years. Writers living in big cities should approach the masses by taking on part-time jobs or other methods whenever possible.

    Socialist Realism is Not the Only Method of Creation, But It is the Best Method of Creation

Regarding socialist realism, Lu Dingyi gave an explanation. He believes that what Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Chinese revolutionary writers and artists, promising writers and artists, must go to the masses, must go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly, to the fiery struggle, to the only, the broadest and richest source, to observe, experience, study, and analyze all people, all classes, all the masses, all vivid forms of life and forms of struggle, all the raw materials of literature and art, and then it is possible to enter the creative process." This passage is the basis of the method of socialist realism. He said that we advocate "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend," allowing various creative methods, various themes, and various styles of works to compete freely. We believe that socialist realism is not the only method of creation, but at the same time, we believe that socialist realism is the best method of creation. He pointed out that those who are high above and do not go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, no matter how they verbally say that they agree with socialist realism, cannot write socialist realist works. To write socialist realist works, one must first "go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly."

Lu Dingyi said that Comrade Mao Zedong told us to "observe, experience, study, and analyze all people, all classes, all the masses, all vivid forms of life and forms of struggle, all the raw materials of literature and art." There are five "all" here. He believes that the reason why some works have the problem of formulaic conceptualization is not, as Hu Feng said, because the writers went to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, but on the contrary, because the writers' understanding of the life of workers, peasants, and soldiers is not comprehensive, and they did not observe, experience, study, and analyze the five "all" that Comrade Mao Zedong said. We should overcome formulaization and conceptualization according to Comrade Mao Zedong's words.

Lu Dingyi also emphasized the issue of whether we can criticize the errors and shortcomings in our work. He said that since it is socialist realism, of course we must write about difficulties, errors, and shortcomings, and also write about the overcoming of difficulties and errors. In the end, the achievements are still the main thing, and the errors and shortcomings are still secondary. Things that ultimately failed can also be written, from which experience can be gained.

    It is Hoped that Writers Will Conduct Long-Term and Whole-Process Observation and Research on the Construction of Factories, Agricultural Cooperatives, Schools, and Stores From Beginning to End

Lu Dingyi made two specific hopes for literary and artists: First, I hope that our writers will conduct observations and research on the construction of our country's factories, agricultural cooperatives, schools, and stores, from beginning to end, for a long time, and in the whole process. If you look at one of each of the four things, you can have a basic understanding of our social outlook. With this basic understanding, it will be easier to have correct views on other things. Second, Party member writers should be incorporated into the Party's grassroots organizations in production units or urban streets to live the life of the Party.

Finally, he proposed to severely criticize the rightists, severely improve work, and severely transform thinking.

    Throw Away the "Burden" of Individualism and Become a Firm Communist Fighter

In his speech, Zhou Yang pointed out that the anti-rightist struggle in the literary and art circles in the past two or three months is a struggle to defend the socialist literary and art line and purify the Party's literary and art team. This struggle has achieved a major victory, but it has also gained serious lessons. Why have old Party members and old writers like Ding Ling, Feng Xuefeng, and Jiang Feng degenerated into the quagmire of anti-Party? He said that as early as 1930, Lu Xun pointed out in his speech at the founding meeting of the League of Left-Wing Writers: If left-wing writers are divorced from actual struggle, if they regard themselves as higher than everything, and regard their work as more noble than all work, then it is easy to become right-wing writers. Lu Xun's words are very correct. Today, it is still worth our vigilance. Zhou Yang said that in our revolutionary literary and art team, many people are from families of exploiting classes and have received bourgeois education. Many people joined the revolution carrying the "burden" of bourgeois individualism. Some people, in the course of revolutionary struggle, gradually threw away the "burden" of individualism, transformed themselves into collective fighters, felt free and light in the revolutionary team, and were of one heart with the Party. The other kind of people have always carried the "burden" of individualism and cannot let go of personal gains and losses and personal grudges; they take credit to the Party for a little achievement, and are dissatisfied with the Party when they encounter a little setback, so they not only cannot throw away the "burden" that hinders their progress, but also increase the weight of the "burden." The stronger the Party and the revolutionary forces, the more "unfree" they feel, and the more incompatible they feel. They are not centripetal to the Party, but centrifugal. When they encounter an important juncture, they cannot withstand the test, and finally embark on the road of anti-Party and even betraying the Party. Now we have to pass the socialist barrier, and the Party's writers should strive to be firm communist fighters and not degenerate into individualistic careerists.

Zhou Yang pointed out that the criticism of the one-bookism is a major issue concerning the use of the communist worldview or the bourgeois individualistic ideology to cultivate young writers. We advocate that writers should serve the people wholeheartedly with their creations. Writing a book, painting a picture, directing a film, and thinking that you are amazing, and thinking that you can bargain with the Party from now on, or even stand on an equal footing with the Party, is an extremely bad manifestation of the bourgeois individualistic worldview. They forget that their reputation and status are given to them by the Party and the people, and therefore can also be taken back from them.

    The Fundamental Difference Between Us and the Bourgeois Rightists in the Literary and Art Circles

Zhou Yang also pointed out that the fundamental difference between the bourgeois rightists in the literary and art circles and us is whether literature and art should serve revolutionary politics? Should it be led by the Party? He said that this difference has existed for a long time. During the Left League period, left-wing writers led by Lu Xun fought against open bourgeois literary factions; later, we continuously fought against the Hu Feng clique, which was hidden in the left-wing literary team and wore the cloak of Marxism to undermine the revolutionary literary movement; now, we are fighting against the anti-Marxist revisionist literary and art line of Feng Xuefeng and others. The rightists and revisionists in the literary and art circles attack socialist literature and art, and their purpose is to negate the socialist system. They do not openly and publicly attack socialist literature and art; they take a aristocratic contemptuous attitude to belittle or obliterate the achievements of socialist literature and art, and slander socialist literary and artistic works as "unreal." They insist that under the socialist system, writers do not have creative freedom, so they have to "tell lies" in their works.

Zhou Yang said that socialist literature is still very young. Soviet literature, counting from Gorky's "Mother", is only fifty years old, and Chinese new literature, counting from the "May Fourth" Movement, is only thirty or forty years old. Compared with thousands of years of feudal literature and hundreds of years of capitalist literature, such young literature will of course have its immature aspects. But socialist literature, compared with the literature of any era in the past, is unprecedented. It is based on the Marxist-Leninist worldview, developed in close contact with the class struggle of the working people, and consciously serves the interests of the working people. Our literature today is not yet mature and has shortcomings, but we must cherish it, support it, and gradually overcome its shortcomings in the process of development. We must believe that our society will surely produce great works.

Regarding the issue of "truth," Zhou Yang said that artistic works, of course, must be true. The difference between us and the rightists is: What is the purpose of writing the truth? The bourgeois rightists and revisionists believe that as soon as literature has a purpose, it is not true. In fact, advocating that literary creation has no purpose is also a purpose. Their purpose is to make literature not serve the socialist revolution. They believe that only writing about the so-called dark side of our society is writing the "truth," and writing about the bright things in our society is "telling lies." Obviously, people standing on different positions have different views on what is "true." The purpose of our literary creation is to encourage people to dedicate themselves to the great cause of socialist revolution, not to make people pessimistic and disappointed and lose confidence in the revolution.

Regarding the issue of creative freedom, Zhou Yang said that people who write for the anti-Party and anti-socialist are not free. For people who write for the interests of the people, there is the greatest freedom in our society. Our writers have full freedom in the selection of materials, the method of expression, and the artistic style.

Regarding the issue of how to improve literary and art work in the future, Zhou Yang believes that we should continue to launch a great debate on literary and art ideology, adhere to the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," adhere to the principle of free competition in literature and art, and prevent crude and simplistic methods. The most important thing at present is to completely solve the problem of the combination of writers, artists, and the masses of workers and peasants. He said that writers must go to factories and rural areas to participate in grassroots work and labor. Only in this way can they truly become one with the masses of workers and peasants, obtain rich artistic feelings, and write good works. Young writers should not specialize too early. The long-term combination of writers and workers and peasants in labor and struggle should become the fundamental system of our literary and art work. Finally, he said that the socialist literary and art cause can only develop under the leadership of the Party. The individual labor of writers should be well combined with the collective cause.

In his speech, Guo Moruo pointed out that the anti-rightist struggle in the literary and art circles is an important front in the entire anti-rightist struggle. The victory of the struggle in the literary and art circles can not only purify the literary and art team and consolidate the Party's leadership over literary and art, but also encourage the battles of all sectors of the country, so that socialist education can be more popular and more in-depth. He said that we must insist on continuing the struggle, strive for a thorough victory, so that every one of our literary and art circles can become proletarian intellectuals; we must work hard to transform ourselves and become proletarian cultural workers.

Mao Dun analyzed several common points of the rightists inside and outside the Party at the meeting: under the guise of anti-dogmatism, they peddle bourgeois private goods; they negate the achievements of the literary and art work led by the Party; they oppose the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and oppose literature and art serving politics; they oppose ideological transformation. Mao Dun refuted the wrong arguments of the rightists on these issues, and pointed out that Feng Xuefeng's literary and artistic thought is revisionist thought.

Ba Jin and Lao She unanimously condemned the anti-Party words and deeds of Ding Ling, Feng Xuefeng, and others. They believe that they must learn from this struggle, thoroughly eliminate the bad influence caused by the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique in the literary and art circles, and resolutely oppose the bourgeois ideology and style existing in the literary and art circles.

In his summary speech, Shao Quanlin said: This expanded meeting of the Party Group of the Writers Association to criticize the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique started on June 6 and lasted until September 17, lasting nearly three and a half months. A total of 27 meetings were held, and more than 140 comrades inside and outside the Party spoke at the meeting, unanimously exposing and criticizing the words and deeds of the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique. He pointed out that this struggle is a continuation of the Party's struggle against the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique in 1955. The nature of the struggle is the struggle between the Party's literary and art line and the anti-Party literary and art line; it is the struggle between Marxist literary and artistic thought and anti-Marxist literary and artistic thought; it is the struggle to consolidate the Party's leadership and defend the Party's unity and purity. He said: Although the discussion of the conference has come to a temporary end, the struggle has not ended. The struggle has achieved a great victory, but it is still a preliminary victory. It must be deepened further and further, continue to criticize the anti-Party words and deeds of Ding Ling and others, and completely eliminate the poison and influence they have caused in the literary and art circles.

    文艺界对丁陈反党集团的斗争获得巨大胜利
    陆定一、郭沫若、茅盾、周扬等在总结大会上作了讲话
    文艺家必须和工农群众结合彻底改造思想　努力建立社会主义文艺和工人阶级的文艺队伍
    本报讯　批判丁玲、陈企霞反党集团的中国作家协会党组扩大会议，在9月16、17两日举行总结大会。参加会议的，除在北京的作家、文艺机关、团体的负责人外，还有中国作家协会各地分会的主要负责人和一部分作家，以及中共各省、市委宣传部门的负责干部等，共一千三百五十多人。中共中央宣传部部长陆定一、副部长周扬在会上作了讲话；中国文学艺术界联合会主席郭沫若、中国作家协会主席茅盾、副主席巴金、老舍等，也在会上讲了话；作家协会党组书记邵荃麟，代表党组对文艺界反对丁、陈反党集团的斗争，作了总结发言。
    政治战线和思想战线上的革命是长期的
    陆定一在会上阐明了这次反右派斗争的重要意义。他说：中国的民主主义革命，经过很长的时间，经过很多次的流血斗争，才取得了胜利。社会主义革命是比民主主义革命更深刻、更广泛的革命。社会主义革命要消灭资本主义剥削制度，要把几千年的人剥削人的历史完全结束，并且使一切剥削制度以后再也不能产生。在我国，这个革命的过程还很短，我国的工人阶级领导的人民政权，1949年就建立起来了，从1949年算起，不过八年；从1953年党提出总路线的时候算起，只有四年。我们完成了农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，我国的经济基础已经起了根本性的变化，生产资料所有制的问题解决了。现在所进行的反对资产阶级右派的斗争，是政治上思想上的社会主义革命。他说，在政权问题和生产资料所有制的问题已经解决之后，还会发生政治战线上思想战线上的剧烈斗争。这种政治上思想上剧烈的斗争，并不是我国所独有的。从历史上看，许多社会主义国家都要经过这样一场斗争。这种斗争，苏联有过，那就是反对托洛茨基派的斗争；匈牙利也有过，就是去年十月的反革命事件。托洛茨基是资产阶级知识分子，匈牙利的裴多菲俱乐部中的领导人物也是资产阶级知识分子。他说，在政权问题已经解决，经济战线上的社会主义革命也基本上完成之后，资产阶级还要造反。领导这种造反的是资产阶级知识分子。这种资产阶级造反在苏联是失败了，在匈牙利，工人阶级的政权曾一度被资产阶级所篡夺，但最后资产阶级也失败了。中国现在以章、罗联盟为中心的资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻，就是要想对社会主义造反。他说，不论在苏联，在匈牙利，在中国，资产阶级造反的目的，都是想推翻社会主义制度，恢复反革命的反动统治。
    陆定一指出，政治战线和思想战线上的革命，是不能一下子就解决的，从现在算起，还要十年、十五年才能基本完成，这是一场长期的严重的阶级斗争。这种斗争在十年十五年以后还会有，只要世界上还有帝国主义和资产阶级存在，政治上、思想上的阶级斗争不会熄灭。
    在社会主义制度下，可以培养大量的工人阶级知识分子，可以改造资产阶级知识分子，也可能产生一部分具有资产阶级意识的知识分子
    陆定一指出：在社会主义制度下面，可以培养出大量的工人阶级的知识分子，可以改造资产阶级的知识分子，这是没有疑问的。但是同时也可能产生一部分具有资产阶级意识的知识分子。他说，我们可以改造资产阶级的知识分子，但在资产阶级知识分子中，有一部分是很难改造的，有的甚至到死都不愿意改造的。他们是资产阶级右派，他们仇视社会主义，同共产党和人民有着不可调和的矛盾。有些人在组织上加入了共产党，但是，即使是共产党的长期的教育，也没有能够把他们改造过来。冯雪峰、丁玲就是这样的例子。
    他说，从这次反右派斗争中，我们还看到，在社会主义社会里，也会产生出新的具有资产阶级意识的知识分子来，像曾彦修、锺惦棐、陈涌、刘绍棠、刘宾雁、郭维等，就是这一类例子。他们有的是很小就到革命根据地，在那里长大的，有的是全国解放后才长大成人的。他们是在社会主义社会里受到教育的，但他们却变成了资产阶级右派分子。
    为什么在社会主义社会里，还会产生出具有资产阶级意识的知识分子来呢？陆定一说，一是由于意识经常落后于存在，旧社会里只有民主主义思想的知识分子，没有经过思想改造，就不能在思想上赶上社会主义的现实，就会从看不惯社会主义制度，走到仇视社会主义制度。二是由于国内国外资产阶级思想的影响，这种影响还会长期存在。三是由于在社会主义社会里，在生活资料的分配问题上还存在着
  “资产阶级法权”，还不能是按照需要来分配，而只能是按照劳动，以商品等价交换的原则来分配生活资料的。
    陆定一说，资本主义社会的“平等”，是“百万富翁同穷人在法律面前的平等”，那是假平等。
  “百万富翁”掌握着生产资料，穷人没有生产资料，只能受“百万富翁”的剥削和压迫，那里会有什么平等呢？在社会主义社会里，实行了生产资料的全民所有制和集体所有制，没有什么人可以把生产资料私有起来，剥削别人了。这就发生了根本性质的变化。
    但是，比起共产主义社会来，社会主义社会里还有不平等。就是在生活资料的分配方面，还残留着不平等。社会主义社会的原则是“各尽所能，按劳取酬”。既然是按劳取酬，那就有不平等。劳动力强的，收入就多一些，劳动力弱的，收入就少一些。一个家庭，人口多，劳动力少，每人收入就少些；人口少，劳动力多，每人收入就多些。在“哥达纲领批判”中，马克思说，在社会主义社会里，“平等的权利有一方面还受着资产阶级范围的限制”，就是指的生活资料的分配方面还有不平等而言。虽然在我们的社会主义社会里，对于收入太少的人有种种帮助和救济的办法，但不平等还会在一定程度上存在。只有社会生产力有了很大的发展，到了共产主义社会，实行“各尽所能，各取所需”的原则，按需要来分配生活资料，这些差别才会消灭。
    陆定一说，我国现在已经进入社会主义社会，但是资产阶级还未完全消灭，因为资本家还拿定息。定息就是一种剥削。现在国家每年要拿出一亿一千万元来支付这项定息。这种定息的办法，要实行到1962年才结束。他说，社会主义社会里，既然实现了生产资料的社会主义所有制，同时还存在着生活资料分配方面的一定程度的不平等，这种不平等，就是产生资产阶级思想的物质基础。最大多数的人，赞成各尽所能，按劳取酬；但是有少数人，却要求少劳多得，甚至不劳而获；还有共产主义者，则愿意自己多劳少得，使社会生产力能有更快的发展，人类更快地进入共产主义社会。因此，一方面是工人阶级的大公无私、全心全意为人民服务的思想，另一方面是自私自利、损人利己的资产阶级思想，两者之间进行着长期斗争。正因为这个原故，所以社会主义社会里，不但会产生大量的工人阶级的知识分子，也会产生一部分具有资产阶级意识的知识分子。不但会出现很多的共产主义者，会有大量的劳动模范，先进工作者等等先进人物和模范事例，同时也会有流氓、阿飞、贪污、盗窃等各种各样的坏人坏事。
  对作家和青年文艺工作者一味捧场的恶劣作风应该彻底改变
    陆定一说，社会主义社会里培养出来的知识分子，有一部分堕落成为具有资产阶级意识的知识分子，是不可免的。但是，如果我们工作做得好，就可以把这种现象减少到最小限度。因此，我们必须从过去吸取经验教训。他指出，近年来社会上出现了一种对作家和青年文艺工作者一味捧场的恶劣风气，它助长了一些人的资产阶级的思想和作风。他说，捧场应该引起被捧的人的反感、讨厌，但有一些青年作家却因此骄傲起来，认为自己是了不起的“天才作家”了，看不起劳动群众，看不起老作家，看不起党，摆起大作家的架子来。有的稿费收入很多，住在大城市，不愿到劳动群众中去，生活腐化堕落，政治上也堕落成为资产阶级右派。今后有关的领导方面，应该接受教训，彻底消除这种恶劣的捧场风气，否则，还会继续害人。
    文艺工作中的两条路线的斗争
    关于文艺工作中的两条路线的斗争，陆定一说，这是由来已久的。1942年延安文艺座谈会以来，这种斗争一直没有停止过。两条路线的根本分歧，是政治与文艺的关系问题，党与文艺的关系问题。我们党一向主张政治领导文艺，因此文艺应该受党的领导，应该为工农兵服务。因此，文艺工作者应该学习马克思主义，同工农兵密切结合。应该团结和教育一切可以团结的文艺工作者，建立广泛的文艺统一战线，为革命服务。我们把革命的文艺工作看作是整个革命事业的不可缺少的一部分。可是从王实味，到胡风，到冯雪峰、丁玲、江丰等，他们主张文艺第一，政治应该服从文艺；应该实行“艺术家领导政治家”，或者让文艺成为独立王国。他们拒绝为工农兵服务和同工农兵结合；他们不要统一战线，打倒一切，唯我独尊。这是一条反党反人民反社会主义的文艺路线。他说这两条路线的斗争过去已经长期存在，今后还会有斗争，不要以为斗争已经结束了。但这次斗争很重要，对于文艺工作的今后发展是有很大的意义的，它将会大大地巩固党对文艺工作的领导。
    灵魂工程师们首先应改造自己的灵魂
    陆定一指出，各种阶级都有自己的灵魂工程师。有奴隶主的，封建主的，资产阶级的，工人阶级的灵魂工程师。对于工人阶级来说，“灵魂的工程师”这个称号，是要鞭策作家们努力进步，而不是要作家们骄傲自大。陆定一说，与其说文艺家是灵魂工程师，还不如说文艺家是灵魂工程师的一部分更为科学些。因为教育家，马克思主义的教员，党和共青团的工作者，也是灵魂工程师。少先队指导员和托儿所保育员，也在做教育的工作。文艺家只是灵魂工程师的一种，但是重要的一种。所有教育别人的人，都可以叫做灵魂工程师。但是，所有教育别人的人，都应当受教育，当人民群众的小学生，然后才能做先生，文艺家也不能例外。灵魂工程师，应该首先改造自己的灵魂。文艺家如果不努力改造自己的灵魂，把自己变成工人阶级的文艺家，他就可能堕落成为灵魂的蛀虫。他指出作家的职业，像战场上第一线的哨兵一样，是光荣的，也是危险的，容易被敌人俘虏。因为文艺家的工作方式是手工业的方式，容易产生个人主义和自由主义的思想；作家又容易出名，出了名，就容易骄傲自满，成为资产阶级思想的俘虏。他指出，作家应该彻底改造思想，把“我”放在集体之下，把人民群众，把党的事业放在最崇高的地位。
    作家应长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去
    陆定一指出，“体验生活”这个口号有好处，但也有极大的坏处。它对过去在反动统治下没有机会去接触工农兵的作家们，是有好处的，他们能够同工农兵接近了。但是对一直生活在革命根据地的作家和对青年作家来说，它已经起了坏作用。因为他们本来已经、或者本来可以长期生活在工农兵群众中的，“体验生活”的口号，却反而客观上妨碍了他们去这样做。有些有志于文艺的青年，在工农兵中生活了几年，写出了一些较好的作品后，就被放到脱离群众的“创作组”去，过早地变成了所谓“专业作家”，于是脱离了生活，住在大城市里，偶尔下乡“体验生活”，逐渐离开了创作的唯一源泉，再也写不出像样的东西，甚至开始堕落下去了。刘绍棠的例子，要特别引起我们的警惕。他认为作家不应该只偶尔去“体验生活”，而应该按照毛泽东同志的指示：“必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农群众中去”。最好是参加劳动，其次是参加基层工作。要同工农兵同劳动，同生死，共患难。对于年纪大的、身体不好的老作家，当然应该另作妥当的安排，但不要因此而动摇我们的根本原则。为着给青年作榜样，希望老作家们实行毛泽东同志在今年4月全国宣传工作会议上所讲的话，能有70％的人在十一年内分批到工厂和农村中去，或者“走马看花”，或者“下马看花”，或者落户几年。住在大城市里的作家，只要可能，就应当用兼任职务或其他方法去接近群众。
    社会主义现实主义不是唯一的创作方法，但是最好的一种创作方法
    关于社会主义现实主义，陆定一作了解说。他认为毛泽东同志说的：“中国的革命的文学家艺术家，有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去，观察、体验、研究、分析一切人，一切阶级，一切群众，一切生动的生活形式和斗争形式，一切文学和艺术的原始材料，然后才有可能进入创作过程。”这段话，就是社会主义现实主义的创作方法的基础。他说，我们主张“百花齐放，百家争鸣”，让各种创作方法、各种题材、各种风格的作品自由竞赛。我们认为社会主义现实主义不是唯一的创作方法，但是我们同时认为，社会主义现实主义是最好的一种创作方法。他指出，高高在上，不到工农兵群众中去，不管怎样口口声声说赞成社会主义现实主义，是写不出社会主义现实主义的作品来的。要写出社会主义现实主义的作品，首先必须“长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去”。
    陆定一说，毛泽东同志告诉我们，要“观察、体验、研究、分析一切人，一切阶级，一切群众，一切生动的生活形式和斗争形式，一切文学和艺术的原始材料”。这里有五个“一切”。他认为有些作品所以有公式化概念化的毛病，并不是像胡风所说的那样，因为作家到工农兵群众中去了，而是恰恰相反，因为作家对于工农兵生活的了解是不全面的，没有去观察、体验、研究、分析毛泽东同志所说的这五个“一切”。我们应该按照毛泽东同志的话去克服公式化、概念化。
    陆定一还着重谈了能不能批评我们工作中的错误和缺点的问题。他说，既然是社会主义现实主义，当然要写困难、错误和缺点，又要写对困难和错误的克服。最后的结果，成绩还是主要的，错误和缺点还是次要的。最后失败了的事情也可以写，从中可以取得经验。
  希望作家对工厂、农业合作社、学校、商店的建设作自始至终的长期的全过程的观察研究
    陆定一对文学艺术家提出两点具体希望：一、希望我们的作家，对于我国的工厂、农业合作社、学校、商店的建设，做自始至终的、长期的、全过程的观察、研究。四样东西，每样看它一个，对我们的社会面貌就可以有一个基本的认识。有了这个基本的认识，对于别的事情，就容易有正确的看法了。二、党员作家，应该编入生产单位或城市街道的党的基层组织，过党的生活。
    最后，他提出要狠狠地反右派，狠狠地改进工作，狠狠地改造思想。
    摔掉个人主义的“包袱”，做坚定的共产主义战士
    周扬在讲话中指出，近两三个月来在文艺界进行的反右派斗争，是保卫社会主义文艺路线，纯洁党的文艺队伍的斗争。这场斗争，已经取得了重大的胜利，同时也取得了严重的教训。为什么像丁玲、冯雪峰、江丰等这些老党员、老作家，会堕落到反党的泥坑呢？他说，早在1930年，鲁迅在左翼作家联盟成立大会上的讲话中，就指出：左翼作家要是脱离实际斗争，要是把自己看得比一切都高，把自己的工作看得比一切工作都高贵，那就很容易变成右翼作家。鲁迅的话是很对的。今天仍值得我们警惕。周扬说，在我们的革命文艺队伍中，有许多人是出身于剥削阶级家庭，受的是资产阶级的教育。许多人是背着资产阶级个人主义的“包袱”参加革命的。一种人在革命的斗争中，经过磨炼，逐渐地把个人主义的“包袱”摔掉，改造自己成为集体主义的战士，在革命队伍中感到自由、轻快；和党一条心。另一种人，却始终背着个人主义的“包袱”不放，抛不开个人得失，个人恩怨；有一点成绩就向党居功，碰一点钉子就对党不满，因此他们不但摔不掉那个妨碍自己前进的“包袱”，反而增加了“包袱”的分量。党和革命的力量越强大，他们便越感到“不自由”，越感到格格不入。他们对党不是向心，而是离心。遇到重要关头他们就经不起考验，最后就走上反党以至叛党的道路。现在我们要过社会主义这一关，党的作家应当努力做坚定的共产主义战士，不要堕落成为个人主义的野心家。
    周扬指出，对一本书主义的批判是关系用共产主义世界观，还是用资产阶级个人主义思想去培养青年作家的重大问题。我们提倡作家应以自己的创作全心全意地为人民服务。写一本书，画一幅画，导演了一部影片，就认为自己了不得，就以为从此可以向党讨价还价，甚至和党分庭抗礼，这是资产阶级个人主义世界观的极端恶劣的表现。他们忘记了他们的名誉、地位，是党和人民给与他们的，因而也是可以从他们手中收回的。
    我们和文艺界的资产阶级右派分子的根本分歧
    周扬又指出：文艺界的资产阶级右派和我们的根本分歧，是文艺要不要为革命的政治服务？要不要受党的领导？他说，这分歧是由来已久的。在左联时期，以鲁迅为首的左翼作家，和公开的资产阶级文学派别作过斗争；以后，我们又连续地和暗藏在左翼文学队伍中的、披着马克思主义外衣破坏革命文学运动的胡风集团作过斗争；现在，又和冯雪峰等人的反马克思主义的修正主义文艺路线进行斗争。文艺界的右派分子和修正主义者，攻击社会主义文艺，目的就是要否定社会主义制度。他们不是正面地公开地攻击社会主义文艺；他们采取贵族老爷式的轻蔑态度来贬低或抹杀社会主义文艺的成就，污蔑社会主义的文艺作品“不真实”。他们硬说在社会主义制度下，作家没有创作自由，所以只好在作品里“说假话”。
    周扬说，社会主义的文学还很年轻。苏联的文学，从高尔基的“母亲”算起，不过五十来年，中国的新文学从“五四”算起，也只有三、四十年。这样年轻的文学和几千年的封建时代的文学，几百年的资本主义时代的文学相比，当然会有它的不够成熟的地方。但是社会主义的文学，和过去任何时代的文学相比，是史无前例的。它是以马克思列宁主义世界观作基础，在和劳动人民的阶级斗争密切联系中发展起来的，是自觉地为劳动人民的利益服务的。我们今天的文学还不够成熟，还有缺点，但是我们必须爱护它，扶植它，使它在发展过程中逐渐克服自己的缺点。我们要相信我们的社会一定会出现伟大作品。
    关于“真实”的问题，周扬说，艺术作品，当然要真实。我们同右派的分歧是：写真实的目的是什么？资产阶级右派和修正主义者认为文学一有目的，就不真实了，其实，主张文学创作无目的，也就是一种目的。他们的目的，就是要使文学不为社会主义革命服务。他们认为只有写我们社会的所谓黑暗面，才是写“真实”，写我们社会的光明事物，就是“说假话”。显然，站在不同立场的人，对于什么是“真实”的看法也是不同的。我们文学创作的目的，是为了鼓舞人们献身于伟大的社会主义革命事业，不是叫人悲观、失望，对革命丧失信心。
    关于创作自由问题，周扬说，为反党反社会主义而写作的人是不自由的。为人民的利益而写作，在我们的社会，有最大的自由。我们的作家在选材、在表现方法、在艺术风格上都有充分的自由。
    对今后如何改进文艺工作的问题，周扬认为，应该继续展开文艺思想上的大辩论，坚持“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，坚持文艺上的自由竞赛的原则，防止粗暴和简单化的作法。当前最重要的是要彻底解决作家、艺术家和工农群众相结合的问题。他说作家必须到工厂农村参加基层的工作和劳动。只有这样才能真正和工农群众打成一片，取得丰富的艺术感受，写出好作品。青年作家不应过早地专业化。作家和工农群众在劳动中、斗争中长期结合，应成为我们文艺工作的根本制度。最后，他说社会主义的文艺事业只有在党的领导下才能发展。作家的个体劳动应该和集体事业很好地结合。
    郭沫若在发言中指出，文艺界反右派斗争是整个反右派斗争中的一个重要战线，文艺界斗争的胜利不仅可以纯洁文艺队伍、巩固党对文艺的领导，并可以鼓舞全国各界的战斗，使社会主义教育能够更普及更深入。他说，我们一定要坚持继续斗争，争取彻底的胜利，使我们文艺界的每一个人都能成为无产阶级的知识分子；我们必须努力改造自己，成为一个无产阶级的文化工人。
    茅盾在会上分析了党内外右派分子的几个共同点：他们在反教条主义的幌子下，贩卖资产阶级的私货；否定党所领导的文艺工作的成绩；反对工农兵方向，反对文艺为政治服务；反对思想改造。茅盾在这几个问题上，驳斥了右派分子的错误的论点，并指出冯雪峰文艺思想是修正主义思想。
    巴金和老舍一致斥责了丁玲、冯雪峰等的反党言行。他们认为必须从这次斗争接受教训，彻底清除丁、陈反党集团在文艺界造成的坏影响，以及坚决反对文艺界存在的资产阶级思想作风。
    邵荃麟在总结发言中说：这次批判丁、陈反党集团的作家协会党组扩大会议，从6月6日开始，到9月17日，历时近三个半月，先后共举行了二十七次会议。在会上发言的有党内外同志一百四十多人，一致对丁、陈反党集团的言行作了揭发和批判。他指出：这次斗争是1955年党对丁、陈反党集团斗争的继续。斗争的性质是党的文艺路线与反党的文艺路线的斗争；是马克思主义文艺思想与反马克思主义文艺思想的斗争；是巩固党的领导，保卫党的团结与纯洁的斗争。他说：现在大会的讨论虽然暂告结束了，但斗争并未结束，斗争取得了巨大胜利，但还是初步的胜利，必须深入更深入，继续批判丁玲等人的反党言行，彻底清除他们在文艺界所造成的毒害和影响。
