Xinhua News Agency, September 16th: Indian Defense Minister Menon arrived in Cairo on the morning of the 15th and immediately held a two-and-a-half-hour meeting with Egyptian President Nasser. He left Cairo that afternoon for London, en route to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly.

Before leaving, Menon told reporters at the airport that he and Nasser had specifically discussed the Middle East situation, and generally discussed the international situation and the issues to be raised at the United Nations General Assembly.

He refuted the Western claim that Syria is a "Soviet satellite state." He said: "As far as I know, Syria is a free country. The West often says this. If you are not their satellite state, they say you are the satellite state of the other side."

　　梅农驳斥西方的诬蔑
    据新华社16日讯　印度国防部长梅农15日上午到达开罗，随即同埃及总统纳赛尔举行了两个半小时的会谈。当日下午离开开罗前往伦敦，转往纽约出席联合国大会。
    梅农离开前在机场对记者说，他同纳赛尔特别讨论了中东形势，一般地讨论了国际形势以及将在联合国大会上提出的问题。
    他驳斥西方所谓叙利亚是“苏联的卫星国”的说法。他说：“据我所知，叙利亚是一个自由国家。西方常常这样说。如果你不是它们的卫星国，它们就说你是另一边的卫星国。”
