Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, September 5th: Anshan Iron and Steel Company exceeded its plan in August for fifteen major products including steel, iron, and steel materials. From January to August, Anshan Iron and Steel has increased its production for the country by more than 48,000 tons of steel materials and more than 34,000 tons of pig iron.

August was the hottest month in Anshan, and the steelworkers overcame the difficulties in operation. The No. 1 Steel Plant set a new record for the fastest steelmaking in August. The ironmaking workers also exceeded their plan and have exceeded the state plan for seven consecutive months from February to August.

The No. 2 Steel Plant and Dagushan Iron Mine, which had performed poorly in completing production plans in the past, improved their production situation in August after the inspection team led by the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China helped them solve many problems. The No. 2 Steel Plant also set a record for the highest monthly output, producing more than 19,000 tons of steel more than June, which had the highest output this year.

Most of the factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel held employee representative conferences in August. During this period, the steelworkers also received a profound socialist education, which inspired the production enthusiasm of the employees. As a result, the production tasks in August were completed excellently.

    鞍钢生产很出色
    十五种主要产品超过计划
    新华社鞍山5日电　鞍山钢铁公司8月份有钢、铁、钢材等十五种主要产品超额完成了计划。从1月到8月份，鞍钢已经为国家增产钢材四万八千多吨，生铁三万四千多吨。
    8月份是鞍山最炎热的一个月，钢铁工人克服了操作中的困难。第一炼钢厂在8月份创造了快速炼钢最高纪录。炼铁工人也超额完成了计划，从2月到8月已经连续七个月超额完成了国家计划。
    过去完成生产计划较差的第二炼钢厂、大孤山铁矿等单位，在中共鞍山市委领导的检查小组的帮助下，解决了许多问题，8月份生产情况都有好转，第二炼钢厂还创造了月产量最高纪录，比今年产量最高的6月份多生产了一万九千多吨钢。
    鞍钢大部分厂矿在8月份曾先后召开职工代表大会，在这期间钢铁工人还普遍地受到了一次深刻的社会主义教育，鼓舞了职工的生产热情，因而8月份生产任务完成得很出色。
