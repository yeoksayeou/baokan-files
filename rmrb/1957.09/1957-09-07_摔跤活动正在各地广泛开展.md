Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, September 6th (Xinhua Reporter Liao Youbin): The team leaders and responsible persons of the 1957 Eleven-City and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Worker Wrestling Competition, currently being held in Hohhot, informed the reporter today about the wrestling activities being carried out in eleven cities and some factories and enterprises in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. He said that currently, more than 3,000 workers in various places are participating in this sports activity. In Tianjin, where wrestling has developed relatively quickly, the number of participating workers has increased from more than 20 in the early days of liberation to more than 300. Wrestling team members from factories such as Tianjin Flour Factory No. 3, No. 4, and Tianjin Baiyang Yarn Factory now enthusiastically hold wrestling matches every weekend. Although Jia Fucai and Li Renshan, who participated in the wrestling competition in Hohhot, have only been wrestling for a short time, it is already evident in the second day's finals that they have a good chance of winning the lightweight and heavyweight championships. In Shenyang and Wuhan, cities with a larger number of workers, almost no workers participated in wrestling activities before liberation, but now the number of participants has reached more than 700. Huangguotun Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory in Shenyang also holds an annual wrestling competition to select the factory champion. Even in Shanghai and Dalian in the south and northeast of the country, which are not very accustomed to wrestling, wrestling enthusiasts have emerged. In Baoding, a city known for wrestling more than a hundred years ago, some factories, mines, schools, and suburban agricultural cooperatives have also resumed wrestling activities after liberation. More than 800 dockworkers, pedicab drivers, and cart pullers in Nanjing regularly practice wrestling, regarding it as a way to improve work efficiency. Workers spontaneously open up venues for wrestling during work breaks.
    Various localities have received strong state support in carrying out wrestling activities among workers. Leading departments in Wuhan, Baoding, and other places have allocated funds to provide wrestling clothing and other equipment for workers participating in wrestling training. Leading departments in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Jinan have also hired people with rich wrestling experience to provide technical guidance. Many cities are now preparing for and beginning to establish wrestling association organizations.

    摔跤活动正在各地广泛开展
    据新华社呼和浩特6日电　新华社记者廖由滨报道：正在呼和浩特市举行的1957年十一城市及内蒙古自治区职工摔跤比赛运动会的领队负责人，今天向记者介绍了十一个城市及内蒙古自治区部分厂矿、企业开展摔跤活动的情况，他说，目前各地参加这项体育活动的职工已达三千余人。在摔跤开展较快的天津市，参加的职工已由解放初的二十多人增加到三百多人。天津市面粉三厂、四厂和天津市白洋纱厂等工厂的摔跤队员，现在每逢周末就兴致勃勃地举行摔跤对抗赛。参加这次在呼和浩特摔跤比赛的贾富财和李仁山，虽然参加摔跤时间很短，但在第二天的决赛中，已看出他们很有希望得到轻量级和重量级冠军。在工人较多的沈阳市和武汉市，在解放前几乎没有工人参加摔跤活动，现在参加的人数已达到七百多人。沈阳市黄姑屯机车车辆厂，每年还举行一次摔跤比赛运动会，选拔厂的冠军。对摔跤不太习惯的祖国南方的上海市和东北的旅大市，也出现了摔跤积极分子。在一百多年前以摔跤之城著称的保定市，解放后部分厂矿、学校和郊区农业合作社也恢复了摔跤活动。南京市经常练习摔跤的八百多名搬运工人、三轮车工人和板车工人，他们把摔跤当作提高工作效率的一种方法，工人们每当工作间隙，就自开场地摔起跤来。
    各地职工在开展摔跤活动上得到了国家大力帮助。武汉市和保定市等地的领导部门，拨出经费给参加练习摔跤的职工添制摔跤衣等设备。上海市、天津市和济南市的领导部门，还聘请一些有丰富摔跤经验的人作技术指导。有不少城市现在已着手筹备和开始建立摔跤协会的组织。
