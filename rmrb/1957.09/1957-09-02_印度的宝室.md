    India's Treasure Chamber
    In Jaipur, Rajasthan, northern India, there is a castle called "Tiger Fort" that once stored countless treasures. It has been learned that this mysterious "treasure chamber" will be open to the public.
    This fort is 300 years old. It is built on a high rock, overlooking the city of Jaipur. According to legend, Man Singh, the first Maharaja of Jaipur during the Mughal Dynasty, plundered a large amount of gold and silver treasures during his expeditions to Ager and Punjab. These treasures were hidden in this secret castle.
    According to tradition, the reigning Maharaja of Jaipur could only enter this fort once in his lifetime. When he went in, he had to cover his eyes, and after being led into the "treasure chamber," he could touch and take one treasure out.
    The current Maharaja entered once in 1944. It is said that the Maharaja touched a bird made of gemstones, with diamond eyes and ruby feathers. This precious bird is still kept in the Jaipur Palace.
    It is said that this "treasure chamber" is now empty, and the treasures have been exhausted over the centuries.

    印度的宝室
    在印度北部拉贾斯坦邦的斋浦尔有一个称为“虎堡”的城堡，里面曾经储藏无数奇珍瑰宝。据获悉，这个神秘的“宝室”将要对公众开放。
    这个堡已经有三百年的历史。它建立在很高的岩石上边，从那里可以俯瞰斋浦尔市。据传说，莫卧儿王朝时代第一任斋浦尔大君曼辛格，在远征阿格罕和旁遮普时掳回大量金银财宝，这些财宝就藏在这个秘密的城堡中。
    按照传统，斋浦尔在位的大君在一生中只能走进这个堡一次。他走进去的时候要把眼睛蒙住，当他被领进这个“宝室”以后，他可以在里面摸一样宝物出来。
    现在的大君在1944年曾经进去过一次。据说这次大君摸出一只宝石做成的鸟，这只宝鸟有钻石做的眼睛和红玉做的羽毛。这只宝鸟现在还保存在斋浦尔宫中。
    据说，这个“宝室”现在已经空空如也，几百年来藏宝已经取尽。
