    Great Blooming and Great Contending is in Full Swing, Improvement Work is Swift and Decisive
    Leading Cadres Go Deep into Workshops, Management Structures Begin Streamlining
    Shenyang Factories and Enterprises Vigorously Improve Work
    (Our Newspaper Shenyang, 25th) Many factories and enterprises in Shenyang are rectifying while making improvements. Significant improvements have been made in the leadership style, production management, and employee welfare work of these enterprises.

    During the blooming and contending, employees criticized the leadership style the most. Employees criticized leading cadres for not being thorough enough in their work style and for not being close enough to the masses, sometimes only taking a "whirlwind" tour of the workshops. This situation has been somewhat improved during the rectification campaign. In particular, leading cadres participating in physical labor once a week or every two weeks allows them to regularly and more deeply understand the production and living conditions of the workers. After leading cadres of the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant participated in physical labor in the foundry workshop, they quickly improved the workshop's ventilation equipment and environmental sanitation based on employee suggestions. Employees were very satisfied and said: "Old problems that had not been solved for several years have been resolved, and we hope that the leadership can regularly persist in the system of working with us." In the past, the Shenyang Power Machinery Plant produced many defective semi-finished cylinders. Later, after the plant's party and government leaders went deep into the casting workshop and organized multiple technical debate meetings between workers and technicians, they finally adopted the improved casting method proposed by veteran workers, which solved a major quality problem. The defect rate of the entire workshop was reduced from 11% to 4%.

    Currently, many enterprises have large organizations and too many non-production personnel, which is an important issue that needs to be resolved in the enterprise rectification campaign. The Shenyang Battery Factory has merged seventeen departments into seven. After the Shenyang No. 3 Rubber Factory merged nineteen departments into fourteen, the monthly work plan used to take twenty-five days to reach the workshop, but after the merger, the layers of procedures were reduced, and it can now be delivered to the workshop in fifteen days. After the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant merged the original twenty-five departments into twenty, it streamlined the management personnel by one hundred and twenty-five people, and mobilized them to return to production posts.

    Many problems in terms of living welfare have also been resolved during this period. Employee housing is a relatively tight issue at present, but now it is better resolved by following the mass line when allocating houses. For example, the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant can only solve the housing problem for fifty-four families this year, but there are five hundred and twenty-five families applying. To resolve this contradiction, a professional team was organized to conduct investigations and visits, and it was found that many families in urgent need were actually not in urgent need. For example, worker Ding Guoxiang from Workshop 1 lived in a very good house, but stated in his application that it was about to "collapse." Clerk He Yongquan lived in a house he had bought long ago, but his application stated: "The landlord wants to sell the house and is forcing me to move out." The investigation results proved that only sixteen families were truly in urgent need. Therefore, the house allocation issue was brought to the employee representative assembly for discussion, and the house allocation principles for family members were formulated, and the housing allocation problem was resolved fairly and reasonably. After the Party Committee of Shenyang Cable Factory frankly disclosed the housing problem to employees, two hundred and ninety-three employees withdrew their housing applications.

    Now these factories are continuing to solicit valuable criticisms from employees in order to fully expose and resolve various problems existing within the enterprises.

### 领导干部深入车间　管理机构开始精简  沈阳工厂企业大力改进工作

    大鸣大放热火朝天　改进工作雷厉风行
    领导干部深入车间　管理机构开始精简
    沈阳工厂企业大力改进工作
    本报沈阳25日电　沈阳市不少工厂企业在边整边改。企业的领导作风、生产管理和职工福利工作都有了较大的改进。
    在鸣放中，职工对领导作风的批评较多。职工批评领导干部作风不深入，和群众接近太少，有时下车间也是“一溜风”。在整风中这种情况已有了若干改进。特别是领导干部每周或每两周参加一次体力劳动，能够经常和更深入地了解职工群众的生产和生活状况。沈阳第二机床厂领导干部到铸工车间参加了体力劳动后，根据职工建议迅速改善了车间通风设备和环境卫生。职工很满意地说：“几年来没有解决的老问题解决了，希望领导上能经常坚持和我们一起劳动的制度。”沈阳动力机械厂过去制造的汽缸半成品废品很多，后经该厂党政领导干部深入铸造车间，组织多次工人和技术人员的技术辩论会，最后采纳了老工人提出的改进浇铸的方法，解决了重大质量问题，全车间废品率由11％降到4％。
    目前不少企业中机构庞大，非生产人员过多，这是企业在整风中需要解决的重要问题。沈阳电池厂已将过去十七个科室合并为七个科室。沈阳第三橡胶厂将十九个科室合并为十四个后，过去每月作业计划得二十五天才能下达车间，合并后减少了层次手续，十五天就可下达车间。沈阳矿山机器厂将原有二十五个科室合并为二十个后，精简了管理人员一百二十五名，动员他们回到生产岗位上去。
    生活福利方面的问题，这一时期也解决不少。职工住宅是当前较为紧张的一个问题，现在分配房屋时走群众路线，就比较好解决了。如沈阳第三机床厂今年只能解决五十四户家属住宅问题，但申请的却有五百二十五户。为解决这一矛盾，组织了一个专业小组进行调查和访问，发现许多急需户实际上并不急需，如一车间工人丁国祥住的房子很好，而在申请书上说成要“倒塌”了，收发员贺永泉住的房子是自己早就买下的，申请书上却说：“房主要卖房子，撵自己搬家”。调查结果证明真正急需的仅有十六家。于是把房子分配问题拿到职工代表大会上讨论，制订了家属住房的分配原则，公平合理地解决了房屋分配问题。沈阳电缆厂党委对住房问题向职工坦率地交了底后，就有二百九十三名职工撤回了要求住房的申请书。
    现在这些工厂正在继续征求职工的宝贵批评，以便充分揭露和解决企业内部存在的各种问题。
