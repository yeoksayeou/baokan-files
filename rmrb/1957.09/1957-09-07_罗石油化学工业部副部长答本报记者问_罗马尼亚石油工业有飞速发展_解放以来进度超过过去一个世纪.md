Our Bucharest Dispatch of the 5th – A few days ago, this reporter interviewed Engineer Nicolae Ionescu, Deputy Minister of the Romanian Petroleum and Chemical Industries, and asked him to answer some questions related to the development of the petroleum industry, an industry with abundant resources in Romania.

Question: What is the development of the Romanian petroleum industry like in the era of the People's Government?

Answer: In the era of the People's Government, the Romanian petroleum industry has exceeded a century of development since its establishment.

Although Romania was once the country with the highest petroleum production in the world, producing 275 tons of crude oil in 1857, while the United States only produced 274 tons in 1859, Romania failed to develop its petroleum industry well because foreign capitalists manipulated Romania's petroleum resources. In the early 20th century, they controlled 91.9% of all investments in Romania's petroleum industry.

In the capitalist era, the exploitation and refining of crude oil were irrational. What capitalists pursued was obtaining the maximum profit with the minimum capital. The equipment installed in 1920 was never updated. The production of 8.7 million tons of crude oil in 1938 was the highest production in Romania's capitalist era. Since then, crude oil production has been declining. In 1944, production was only 3 million tons.

Due to the establishment of its own petroleum machinery industry and the import of petroleum machinery from the Soviet Union, crude oil production has increased from 3.8 million tons in 1947 to 10.92 million tons in 1956. Drilling progress has increased from 300,400 meters to 897,400 meters. Production wells have increased from 2,200 to 4,000.

Newly developed oil fields include Petersti and Oltenia. The Moldavian oil region, which was previously neglected, has now become an important oil production center. Oil fields are almost scattered throughout the Carpathian Mountains.

In the era of the people's democratic government, the development of Romania's petroleum industry is also reflected in the increase in refining capacity. Now, many modern facilities have been established, and all crude oil can be processed by ourselves. In the era of the capitalist government, there was no modern refining equipment, and a large amount of crude oil had to be exported while importing gasoline and engine oil.

Question: What is the position of the petroleum industry in Romania's national economy? What are its development prospects?

Answer: The development of the petroleum industry has created the possibility of meeting internal consumption and expanding product exports. The export volume in 1956 was seven times that of 1948 and three times that of 1950.

The product quality obtained in the petroleum processing industry is relatively high, obtaining gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and special engine oils with higher coefficients.

Products necessary for the development of other industries have been obtained, such as: paraffin wax, petroleum jelly, detergents, durable lubricating greases, oxidized hydrocarbons, degumming agents, etc.

In 1958, a modern factory manufacturing advanced engine oil will be put into production, which will increase engine oil production by seven times compared to 1955. In order to ensure the availability of some daily necessities, such as plastics, rayon, and synthetic rubber, a petroleum chemical complex has been built in Borzesti, Moldavia. With the help of the Soviet Union, a huge synthetic rubber factory is also under construction.

Question: How has the living standard of Romanian petroleum workers improved in the era of the People's Government?

Answer: In the era of the people's democratic government, the labor and living conditions of the working people have been greatly improved. In the past six years, more than 1,700 new workers' houses, schools, clubs, and clinics have been built. New workers' cities have been established, such as Lugchesti, Onesti, and Jiagu. Workers' sanatoriums have been established in the mountains and by the sea. Active activities have also been carried out in medical care.

In 1956, the average wage of refinery workers increased by 11% compared to 1955.

Question: How do the brotherly people of China and Romania help and cooperate with each other in developing the petroleum industry?

Answer: A few years ago, Romanian experts had contact with Chinese petroleum workers and technicians and established contact in the most important petroleum industry sectors.

The Romanian People's Republic has helped China with machinery and experts. Romanian experts and Chinese petroleum workers jointly drilled a Romanian-Chinese "Friendship Well" in the Gobi Desert. Scientific and technical contracts have also been signed between our two countries. Our oil wells and factories warmly welcome the visits of Chinese guests, regarding them as true envoys of friendship. Romanian petroleum workers are sincerely willing to help fraternal China develop its petroleum industry. (Attached picture)

    罗石油化学工业部副部长答本报记者问
    罗马尼亚石油工业有飞速发展
    解放以来进度超过过去一个世纪
    本报布加勒斯特5日电　日前，本报记者访问了罗马尼亚石油化学工业部副部长尼古来·伊万乃斯库工程师，请他回答了一些与石油工业——这个在罗马尼亚有丰富的资源的工业的发展有关的问题。
    问：人民政权年代罗马尼亚石油工业的发展情况如何？
    答：在人民政权年代里，罗马尼亚石油工业已超过了从它建立以来一个世纪的发展。
    罗马尼亚虽然曾经是世界上第一个生产石油最多的国家，在1857年，罗马尼亚就出产原油二百七十五吨。而美国到1859年才生产了二百七十四吨。但罗马尼亚没能很好地发展自己的石油工业，因为外国资本家操纵了罗马尼亚的石油资源。在二十世纪初期，他们控制了罗马尼亚石油工业全部投资的91.9％。
    在资本主义时代，原油的开采和提炼是不合理的。资本家所追求的是用最小的资本取得最大的利润；1920年安装起来的设备，从来没有更新过。1938年的八百七十万吨原油的产量，是罗马尼亚资本主义时代的最高产量。自此以后，原油的产量一直下降。1944年的产量只有三百万吨。
    由于建立了自己的石油机械工业和从苏联进口石油机械，原油产量已从1947年的三百八十万吨，提高到1956年的一千零九十二万吨。钻井进度从三十万零四千公尺，提高到八十九万七千四百公尺。生产井从二千二百个上升到四千个。
    新开发的油田有彼得什蒂、奥尔丹尼亚。而过去曾被忽视的摩尔达维亚油区现在已变为一个重要的采油中心了。油田几乎散布在喀尔巴阡山的各地。
    在人民民主政权的年代里，罗马尼亚石油工业的发展也表现在炼油能力的提高，现在建立了许多现代化的设备，全部原油都能自己加工了。在资本主义政权的年代，没有现代化的炼油设备，那时不得不输出大量的原油，而进口汽油和机油。
    问：石油工业在罗马尼亚国民经济中的地位怎样？它的发展前途如何？
    答：石油工业的发展，创造了满足内部消费及扩大产品输出量的可能性。1956年输出量为1948年的七倍，为1950年的三倍。
    在石油加工工业方面取得的产品质量比较高，得到了系数较高的汽油、火油、柴油及特种机油。
    得到了发展其他工业所必须的产品如：石蜡、凡士林、去污剂、耐用润滑膏、熂烃酸、脱胶剂等。
    在1958年一个现代化的制造高级机油的工厂将投入生产，它将使机油产量比1955年提高七倍。为了保证获得一些日用品，如塑料、人造丝、人造橡胶等，在摩尔达维亚的勃尔塞什蒂建设了一个石油化学联合工厂。靠苏联的帮助，还在建设一个巨大的人造橡胶厂。
    问：人民政权年代罗石油工人的生活水平提高的情况怎样？
    答：在人民民主政权的年代里，劳动人民的劳动和生活条件都有了很大改善。最近六年来，新造了一千七百多所工人住宅、学校、俱乐部和诊疗所。建立起新的工人城，如路格切什蒂、奥乃什蒂、家谷等。在山林和海边都建立了工人休养所。在医疗保健方面也展开了积极的活动。
    1956年炼油工人的平均工资，比1955年提高了11％。
    问：中罗两国兄弟般的人民在发展石油工业上是怎样互助合作的？
    答：几年以前，罗马尼亚专家就同中国石油工人和技术人员有了接触，在最重要的石油工业部门里建立了联系。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国帮助了中国机器和专家。罗马尼亚专家与中国石油工作人员在戈壁沙漠里共同钻了一口罗中“友谊之井”。在我们两国之间还签订了科学技术合同。我国的油井和工厂，热诚地欢迎中国客人的访问，把他们看作是真正的友谊的使者。罗马尼亚石油工作者都衷心愿意帮助兄弟中国发展石油工业。（附图片）
