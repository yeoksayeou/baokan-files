　　Muckraking and Protest Literature

　　In recent years, pornography has attacked American newsstands like a raging flood, encroaching upon their territory. Publishing companies in the three major cities of New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles publish an average of two new types of yellow, vulgar publications each month. According to incomplete statistics, seventy-five new kinds of dirty and obscene magazines have appeared in the United States since 1954. The American "Nation" magazine recently made a preliminary analysis of these unbearable publications, exposing the decline of American culture.

　　These lewd publications, which mainly rely on newsstands for sales, are sometimes published irregularly, and some specialize in using the "inaugural issue" method to swindle readers. After publishing one or two issues, they change their name and select another stimulating title for publication. Some also have a large number of regular readers. Their sales volume is unmatched by any other type of newspaper or magazine. Their price on newsstands is divided into two types: 50 cents and 25 cents per copy. The vendor's profit is 10%. Such a large commission cannot be provided by any other type of newspaper or magazine.

　　"The Nation" magazine divides these morally corrupt publications into three categories.

　　The first category is led by "Playboy," which took the lead after the war and made the most profit. "Playboy" has a circulation of 900,000 copies and a total profit of 3.5 million US dollars in 1956. This category is the so-called "urban man's pastime," priced at 50 cents per copy. The most popular include "Gent," "Rogue," "Playboy," "Devil," etc. The names of these publications already allow you to imagine their content. Their common feature is to use nude women's photos as a selling point, combined with erotic stories plagiarized from old magazines from twenty or thirty years ago.

　　The second category is led by "Confidential," another nationally popular vulgar publication after the war. Among them are "Banned News," "Behind the Scenes," "Inside News," and so on. This type of publication specializes in reporting on the private lives of movie stars. However, apart from "Confidential," which tries every means and spares no expense to "interview" and "write" sensational scandalous histories, most other publications select murder, crime, and other types of themes from old newspapers from decades ago to write stories.

　　The third category is dominated by thriller stories, supplemented by pornography. The price is cheaper, and the sales volume is not as good as the first two categories. Famous ones include "Rugged," "Duel," "Man's Story," and so on. What they report are, of course, some absurd stories to stimulate readers. Their titles include "Camping on Fifth Street," "The Murderous Beast of Honduras," and the like.

　　Although the proliferation of pornography on American newsstands has attracted the attention of the American public, the American authorities have not taken any measures to stop the tide of pornography.

　　Interestingly, merchants who publish vulgar publications have also found a theoretical basis for publishing pornographic works. One merchant declared:

　　"We are the contemporary muckrakers. People are tired of the hypocrisy of magazines, newspapers, and television. They want to see celebrities make fools of themselves in public. Of course, I understand that we are not as able to contribute to society as the muckrakers of the past. However, our generation is very prosperous. This kind of literature of ours is a kind of protest literature in the prosperous era." (Le Shan)

　　粪耙与抗议文学
    最近几年以来，色情文学像洪水猛兽一般袭击着美国的报摊、侵占着美国报摊的地盘。纽约、芝加哥、洛杉矶三个大城市的出版公司平均每月共出版两种新型的黄色下流刊物。据不完全的统计，从1954年到现在，美国新出了七十五种肮脏的、淫秽的杂志。美国“民族”周刊最近对这些不堪入目的出版物作了一个初步的分析，暴露出美国文化堕落的情况。
    这些利用报摊为主要推销手段的猥亵出版物，有的是不定期出版的，有的专门用出“创刊号”的方式来撞骗，出了一两期就改头换面另选一个富有刺激性的名称出版，有的也拥有大量的固定的读者。它们的销售量之大为任何其他种类报刊所望尘莫及。它们在报摊上的售价分为两种，一种每份美金五角，一种每份美金二角五分。摊贩的利润是10％。这样大的佣金也是任何其他种类报刊所无法提供的。
    “民族”周刊把这些伤风败俗的出版物分成三类。
    第一类以大战以后一马当先、获利最丰的“浪子”为祖宗。“浪子”的销数为九十万份，1956年总利润美金三百五十万元。这一类是所谓“城市男人的消遣品”，售价每份美金五角，最流行的有“酒店”、“胡闹”、“花花公子”、“魔鬼”等等。这些刊物的名称就已经使你能够想像其内容。它们的共同特点是以裸体女人的照片为号召，配合着从二、三十年以前的旧杂志上抄袭剽窃的色情故事。
    第二类以战后另一个风行全国的下流刊物“秘闻”为首。其中有“被禁止发布的新闻”、“幕后”、“内幕新闻”等等。此类刊物以报道电影明星私生活为特色。但是，除了“秘闻”千方百计，不惜一切手段“采访”、“编写”耸人听闻的秽史以外，绝大多数其他刊物都从几十年以前的旧报纸上，选取情杀、罪案等类题材编写故事。
    第三类是以惊险故事为主、色情为副的刊物。售价较贱，销售量也不及前两类。著名的有“崎岖”、“决斗”、“男人的故事”等等。它们所报道的当然都是一些荒诞不经的故事，给读者以刺激。其名目有“五号街的野营”、“洪都拉斯的杀人巨兽”之类。
    美国报摊上色情文学充斥的情况，虽然已经引起了美国公众的注意，但是美国当局一直没有采取任何措施来阻止色情文学的狂潮。
    有意思的是，出版下流刊物的商人还为出版色情文学作品找到了一个理论根据。有一个商人宣称：
    “我们是当代的粪耙。人们已经对杂志、报纸、电视的虚伪感到厌倦了。他们希望看见知名人士当众出丑。当然，我很明白，我们并不像昔日的粪耙那样能对社会有所贡献。不过，我们这一代很繁荣。我们的这种文学就是繁荣时期里的一种抗议文学。”      （乐山）
