Anshan Internship Notes
Zhang Yingchuan

Master Zhang in the forging workshop has been repeating a few simple actions next to red-hot iron blocks for many years, but he never thought this was "burying his talent." Whenever he has free time, he helps others with their work. He has a nickname: "Old Enthusiast." The workshop completed its monthly production plan ten days ahead of schedule; how would that have been possible without these "Old Enthusiasts"? In Anshan Iron and Steel, there are countless "Old Enthusiasts" like this.

One afternoon, when we entered the marking section of the machine repair workshop, the day's work was already finished. Suddenly, the team leader ran over and pulled us aside, saying, "What bad luck, the work's already done. The country sent you here to learn, we can't let you go back empty-handed! Come on, let us explain some more things to you." The masters we encountered were all this enthusiastic. Sometimes, we were afraid that asking too many questions would affect the masters' work, especially since they were paid by piece. But some veteran workers put aside their work and told us their valuable experiences accumulated over decades without reservation. Before leaving, they patted our shoulders and said, "The country sent you here to intern, it's wrong not to ask. Don't be afraid of affecting our work, the rightists angered us so much that we completed the production tasks ahead of schedule." Crane (overhead crane) operator, I don't know your name, but that doesn't matter, your noble qualities will always be remembered in my heart. You work all day surrounded by clouds of smoke, heat, and dust, but when the organization took your health into consideration and prepared to transfer you to another job, you shed tears, unwilling to leave your long-time comrades and your work post.

In the evening, we walked along the newly built roads to visit. The evening breeze opened every window, and melodious songs came from every window. The antennas of the radios on the roofs were as dense as spider webs. Here we are, this is today's workers' residential area. Walking inside, children were eating melons, and there were bicycles, sewing machines, and two clocks in the house, actually, the clocks were completely unnecessary, because everyone except the children had a watch. For us young people who grew up in the new society, who would have thought that just over a decade ago, here you could only hear the hungry cries of workers' children and the groans of patients, presenting a very desolate picture. Thinking about the past and looking at today, the master said, "The Communist Party is truly our lifeline, whoever dares to touch it, we'll fight them to the death."

On the last autumn night leaving Anshan, we visited Wang Chonglun. Comrade Wang Chonglun, in the past we respected you only because you were a model worker and a people's representative. Today, we respect you even more, and we deeply love you, and regard you as our role model. Because we understand you even further. In the past, none of us would have imagined: when you were young, you would drag a tattered straw bag and sleep next to the stove in the workshop in winter, and when your pants caught fire and the pain woke you up, you were still confused, the heavy labor had ravaged your body so much. But today, how quickly you have grown! After listening to your talk about the process of improving tools, we deeply realized a truth: love for the new life and love for the people are the source of wisdom.

Farewell, you kept sending us to the alleyway, standing on the road and waving to us for a long time. People will surely think we are old friends, who would have thought that today we are meeting for the first time.

An old master worker told me: "You internship students are getting better year by year. In the past, some students would walk around with their hands behind their backs, looking around, covering their noses, gesticulating, and even patting off the dust when leaving the workshop. You are not afraid of getting dirty, not afraid of the heat, and work very hard, which is very good." Hearing these words from the master, I was even happier than getting a five-point grade. I am willing to live with these hardworking and enthusiastic people for the rest of my life, learn from them, and work together with them to do a good job, train myself in production practice, and truly become a working-class intellectual.

    鞍山实习手记
    张应传
    锻造车间的张师傅，多年来一直在红热的铁块旁边重复着几个简单的动作，但他从来没有想到这是“埋没了自己”。只要一有空，就去帮别人干活。他有个外号叫“老积极”。车间提前十天完成了月度生产计划，没有这些“老积极”那怎么可能呢。在鞍钢，这样的“老积极”是数不完的。
    一天下午，我们走进机修车间划线工段的时候，当天的活儿就干完了。忽然组长跑来了，把我们拉到一边说：“真不巧，活儿已经干完了。国家派你们来学习，咱们可不能叫你们空着手回去啊！来，咱给你们再讲点。”我们碰到的师傅们都是这样热情的。有时，我们怕问的多了影响师傅们的工作，再加上他们又是记件工资。但有的老工人却丢下工作，把几十年累积起来的宝贵经验毫无保留地告诉了我们。临走时拍拍我们的肩膀说：“国家派你们来实习，不问可不对。不要怕影响咱们的工作，右派气得我们把生产任务早就提前完成了。”驾驶天车（起重机）的师傅，我不知道你的姓名，这没有关系，你高贵的品质永远铭记在我的心里。你整天在浓烟、高热和灰沙的云雾包围中工作，但当组织上照顾你的身体，准备给你调动工作的时候，你却掉下了眼泪，不愿离开相处已久的同志和自己的工作岗位。
    傍晚，我们踏着新修的道路去访问。晚风吹开了每一扇窗户，每一扇窗户里都传出了悦耳的歌声，屋顶上的收音机的天线像蛛网一样密。到了，这就是今天的工人住宅区。走进去，孩子们正在吃瓜，屋里放着自行车，缝纫机，挂钟还有两个，其实它完全是多余的，因为除了小孩每个人都有手表。对于我们这些在新社会长大的青年来说，谁会想到十多年前，在这儿你能听到的只有工人孩子们饥饿的哭声和病人的呻吟，呈现在面前的竟是一幅十分凄凉的图景。想想过去，看看今天，师傅说话了：“共产党真是咱的命根子，谁敢动一动，咱就和他拼命。”
    离开鞍山的最后一个秋夜，我们访问了王崇伦。王崇伦同志，过去我们尊敬你，只是因为你是劳动模范，人民代表。今天，我们更尊敬你，而且深深地爱上了你，把你看作我们的榜样。因为我们更进一步地了解了你。过去，我们谁也不会想到：你年青时冬天会拖过破草包睡在车间的炉子旁边，当裤子烧起了洞，痛得把你惊醒时你还糊里糊涂，沉重的劳动，是这样摧残你的身体。可是今天，你成长得多快呀！听过了你改进工具的经过的谈话以后，我们深深地体会到一个真理：对于新的生活，对于人民的爱才是智慧的源泉。
    告别了，你一直把我们送出巷口，站在马路上久久地向我们招手。人们一定会以为我们是多年的好友，谁会想到今天我们还是第一次见面呢。
    有个老师傅和我谈：“你们实习的同学是一年比一年好，过去有些同学背着手东看看西望望，掩着鼻子，指手划脚，走出车间还要拍拍灰尘。你们不怕脏，不怕热，干活儿挺起劲，这很好。”听了师傅这些话，真比得了五分还要高兴。我愿一辈子和这些勤劳、热情的人们生活在一起，向他们学习，和他们一齐把工作做好，在生产实践中锻炼自己，真正做一个工人阶级知识分子。
