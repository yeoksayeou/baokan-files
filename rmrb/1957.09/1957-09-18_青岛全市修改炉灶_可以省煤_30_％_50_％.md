Qingdao, September 16th - The mass movement for saving coal in production and daily life in Qingdao has basically taken shape. Household coal, which accounts for 75% of the city's coal supply, can now save 30%-50% of coal after stove modifications.

Qingdao City began its efforts to save coal in July. In order to balance the annual coal supply and demand, the Municipal Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee first focused on modifying existing stoves. The Coal Construction Company, in coordination with various departments, adopted methods such as collective visits, picture exhibitions, and key experiments to promote the use of new stoves such as the flue stove around the pot, the enclosed stove, and the rotating stove. For production coal, they promoted single-sided coal feeding active furnace plates, "three diligences and three speeds," and other methods. As of the 10th, the stoves of collective canteens in government offices, factories, and other units have been modified, and 34,000 households in the city have modified their stoves. The city has saved a total of more than 19,000 tons of coal. It is expected that all stoves in the city will be modified by the beginning of October.

　　青岛全市修改炉灶
　　可以省煤30％——50％
    本报青岛16日电　青岛市全民性的节约生产和生活用煤运动，目前已基本形成。占全市煤炭供应量75％的生活用煤，经过修改炉灶以后，已能省煤30％—50％。
    青岛市大力开展节约用煤的工作，是从7月开始的。为了使全年煤炭供需平衡，市增产节约委员会首先抓住修改现有炉灶的工作。煤建公司配合各部门采用集体参观、举办图片展览、重点试验等办法，推广使用锅周烟道灶、围灶、转灶等新式炉灶；对生产用煤则推广单边投煤活动炉牌、三勤三快等方法。截至10日止，机关、工厂等集体伙食单位的炉灶已修改完毕，全市已有三万四千户居民修改了炉灶。全市已共节约用煤一万九千多吨。预计到10月初，全市炉灶就可以改完。
