Good News for 160,000 People of All Ethnic Groups on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau
    Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Formally Established
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Kunming, September 14th) Another significant achievement in Yunnan Province's implementation of ethnic regional autonomy: The Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture was formally established yesterday. The People's Representative Conference of all ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture elected Living Buddha Songmou (Tibetan) as the governor, and Ji Fu, Wang Bendeng, Wang Xueshuo, Zhao Baohe (all Tibetan), Yu Aden (Lisu), Wang Jiarui (Naxi), and Wen Xueren (Han) as deputy governors. Temu (female), Living Buddha Wang Hao (both Tibetan), Living Buddha Duga (Naxi), Living Buddha Gada (Tibetan), Zhang Gaolin (Han), Yang Guochang (Hui), Kang Zhilin (Lisu), and Adi Ziling (Nu), along with twenty-five others, were elected as members of the Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee. Yang Yanhou (Tibetan) was appointed as the president of the Intermediate People's Court. Zhongdian was designated as the capital of the autonomous prefecture.
    On the afternoon of the same day, more than 4,000 people of all ethnic groups held a celebration rally for the establishment of the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. At the meeting, Deputy Governor Zhang Chong presented the seal of the Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee, and the governor, deputy governors, and members of the autonomous prefecture solemnly swore to take office. Peng Sixke, a representative of the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission, spoke, encouraging people of all ethnic groups to unite closely around the Party and strive to build the autonomous prefecture and the socialist motherland.
    The representatives attending the meeting believed that the establishment of the long-awaited Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture is a milestone in the political, economic, and cultural development of more than 160,000 people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture. In the future, all ethnic groups will unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and work with the people of the whole country to build a socialist motherland.
    Introduction to the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture
    The Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture includes Zhongdian, Weixi, and Deqin counties (the capital of the autonomous prefecture is in Zhongdian County), with an area of ​​approximately 36,800 square kilometers. Most areas are more than 3,000 meters above sea level. It is home to 163,041 people of Tibetan, Lisu, Naxi, Yi, Miao, Hui, Han, and other ethnic groups, of which Tibetans account for 55.12% of the total population. The Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture is the highest corner of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. The climate is similar to that of the Tibetan Plateau. In terms of products, it is rich in famous local specialties such as velvet antlers, musk, caterpillar fungus, fritillary bulbs, Poria cocos, fur, and yak butter. There are also a large number of virgin forests, making it one of the largest forest areas in the country. Mineral resources are also very abundant, producing gold, silver, steel, iron, mercury, asbestos, snuff, sulfur, and other minerals. Animal husbandry is particularly developed, accounting for about 50% of the total income. There are large herds of cattle and sheep everywhere, and a large number of pian cattle are also produced. The land in the prefecture is fertile, and the grasslands are vast. In the seven years since its liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Diqing area has made significant progress in all aspects of work. As a result of abolishing the system of national oppression, smoothing relations, and mediating ethnic disputes, social order has become increasingly stable. The government has distributed more than 1.19 million yuan of various unconditional production subsidies, relief, and consolation funds, more than 300,000 catties of grain, and more than 770,000 yuan of agricultural loans in the Diqing area, solving many difficulties in the production and life of the masses. In 1953, land reform was implemented in the first, second, and third districts of Weixi County, and advanced cooperation was achieved last year. The fourth and fifth districts of Weixi County and the Jinjiang District of Zhongdian also completed peaceful negotiation on land reform before May of this year. Production in these areas has greatly developed, increasing from 3 dou of grain per mu before liberation to about 1 dan. In Deqin and most areas of Zhongdian, where Tibetans mainly live, some minor reforms have also been carried out. The Ula system has long been abolished, and some feudal privileges and exploitation have been abolished. Grain production has increased by 20% to 30% compared with before liberation, and livestock has increased by 25%. With the opening of the Lizhong Highway, material exchanges have expanded, and the price difference between industrial and agricultural products is shrinking year by year. Cultural, educational, and health undertakings have also developed accordingly. Before liberation, there was only one middle school and eighteen primary schools in the entire region. Now there are two middle schools and 191 primary schools. In addition to dispatching medical teams to various places for mobile treatment, the government has also established three health centers in various counties, and has treated more than 200,000 people. Through the above work, 1,082 cadres from various ethnic groups have been trained locally. At the same time, the Party has conscientiously implemented the policy of long-term unity, education, and transformation of the upper strata of ethnic groups and the protection of religion. At present, 116 public figures from various ethnic groups hold positions in political power and consultative organs at all levels.

    迪庆藏族自治州介绍
    迪庆藏族自治州包括中甸、维西、德钦三个县（自治州的首府在中甸县），面积约三万六千八百多平方公里，大部地区拔海均在三千公尺以上。这里居住着藏、傈僳、纳西、彝、苗、回、汉等民族共十六万三千零四十一人，其中藏族占总人口的55.12％。迪庆藏族自治州是云贵高原最高的一角。气候和康藏高原相似。在物产方面，盛产鹿茸、麝香、虫草、贝母、茯苓、皮毛、酥油等著名的土特产品。还有大量的原始森林，是全国最大的森林区之一。矿产蕴藏也很丰富，出产金、银、钢、铁、水银、石棉、水烟、硫磺等。畜牧业特别发达，约占总收入的50％，各处皆有大群的牛羊，还产有大量的犏牛。全州土地肥沃，草原辽阔。七年多来，迪庆地区在中国共产党领导下，各方面工作都有显著的进展。由于废除了民族压迫制度，疏通关系，调解民族纠纷的结果，社会秩序日益安定。政府在迪庆地区发放了各种无偿生产补助，救济、慰问款一百一十九万余元，粮食三十余万斤，农业贷款七十七万多元，解决了群众生产生活上的许多困难。1953年维西县一、二、三区实行了土地改革，去年实现了高级合作化，维西县四、五两区和中甸金江区也在今年5月以前完成了和平协商土地改革。这些地区的生产有了很大的发展，由解放前的一亩地收三斗粮食增加到一担左右。在藏族主要聚居的德钦和中甸大部分地区，也进行了一些次要改革，乌拉制度早已取消，并废除了一部分封建特权剥削，粮食较解放前增产20％至30％，牲畜增加25％。由于丽中公路通车，物资交流扩大，工农业产品差价正在逐年缩小。文教卫生事业也有了相应的发展，解放前全区只有中学一所，小学十八所，现有中学二所，小学一百九十一所。政府除派遣了医疗队到各地巡回治疗外，又在各县设立了三个卫生院，先后医治了二十余万人。通过以上工作，培养了当地各民族干部一千零八十二人。与此同时，党认真执行了长期团结、教育、改造民族上层和保护宗教的政策。目前已有一百一十六个各民族公众领袖人物在各级政权、协商机关担任职务。
