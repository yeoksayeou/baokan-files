　　Defending the Motherland's Iron Eagles
　　By Our Correspondent Hu Sisheng
    On the afternoon of September 8th, just outside Warsaw, the sun shone brightly under a clear blue sky. Three hundred thousand spectators packed the Babice military airfield. This year marked the largest aviation festival review since liberation, and who wouldn't want to witness the magnificent sight of aerial heroes?
    After the Polish national anthem was played, a signal flare was launched, and hundreds of thousands of eyes gazed into the distance. Shortly after, six black dots appeared, gradually approaching and growing larger. Three propeller-driven planes, towing three gliders, flew slowly into view. According to tradition, these were the "leading" aircraft, signaling the official start of the review.
    A key event was the parachute jump. An aircraft flew at an altitude of 1,300 meters, and in an instant, three athletes jumped out of the cabin in succession. They descended straight down, resembling someone falling from a high building. Just as people began to worry, they deployed their parachutes and descended slowly. People were talking about one of the jumpers, Skadurska, the world parachute champion. This type of jump is called a delayed-opening parachute jump. It requires excellent physical condition, remarkable willpower, and rigorous training. Polish athletes have achieved good results in this area. A few days ago, the new record set by thirty-six-year-old Polish Air Force Captain Dula caused a sensation throughout Poland. He jumped from a high-speed jet bomber at an altitude of 12,600 meters at night, under adverse weather conditions and extremely poor visibility, and fell for three minutes and fifteen seconds, or 12,000 meters, before deploying his parachute.
    The performances of various gliders evoked admiration. Several-person and one-person gliders moved up, down, left, and right, relying on the power of air currents. A team of twelve "Fly" gliders flew in, performing simultaneous somersaults in the air. They formed a large circle above the audience, and then glided past the audience at a height of a dozen meters. These athletes are mostly trained by Polish aviation clubs, which are located throughout the country.
    Just as a few black dots were spotted in the distance, a group of jets suddenly streaked overhead. Two jet fighters engaged in aerial combat, and formations of jets in the air were very captivating. But the most interesting and difficult program was the collective aerobatics performed by five jets. Look, these five jets flew together, flipped over simultaneously, and, bathed in the sunlight, suddenly charged straight into the sky, then made semi-circular flight paths, and flew horizontally together. Insiders said that this was the first time the Polish Air Force had performed this way; previously, only three jets could perform collectively. This shows that the People's Poland's Air Force has reached a very high level of flight skill. During the three-hour air show, we saw all kinds of aircraft. There were jet fighters and helicopters, bombers and ambulances, as well as trainers and gliders. The "fly-by" of four hundred jets of the Polish Air Force was especially impressive. Those concerned told me that these planes were all made in Poland.
    The aviation festival review ended. Polish Minister of National Defense General Spychalski said in his congratulatory message that the Polish Air Force is "loyal to world peace and the friendship of socialist countries, and the pride of our army that defends the Polish People's Republic." Polish Air Force Commander-in-Chief Frey-Bielecki also said on the eve of the festival: "At present, our Air Force not only has a large quantity, but its quality has also reached the level of the world's air forces." Their words are meaningful. People know that eighteen years ago today, the Nazi German bombers and fighters, emblazoned with iron crosses, intruded into Polish airspace, wreaking havoc as if in an undefended land. This is a painful lesson that every adult Pole will never forget. But today, the People's Poland's Air Force is an iron eagle sufficient to defend the tranquility of its homeland. If this is a merit of the People's Poland, it is by no means an exaggeration.

　　保卫祖国的铁鹰

    9月8日下午，华沙郊外，大好阳光，一派蓝天。三十万观众把巴比采军用飞机场挤得水泄不通。今年是解放后最大的一次航空节检阅，谁不想目睹一下空中健儿的雄姿呢？
    奏波兰国歌后，信号弹一起，几十万双眼睛望着远方。不多时，六个黑点由远而近由小而大，三架螺旋桨式飞机拖着三架滑翔机徐驶而来。按照传统，这是“带头”的飞机，表示检阅正式开始了。
    一个重要的节目是跳伞。一架飞机在一千三百公尺的空中飞行，霎时三个运动员陆续跳出机舱，只见他们从空中直线下降，像一个人从高楼上失足掉下来一样，人们正为他们十分担忧时，他们才拉开降落伞徐徐下降。人们都在谈论里面有一个女跳伞员斯卡杜尔施卡，她是世界跳伞冠军。这种跳伞方法叫做延迟开伞跳伞。用这种方法跳伞需要良好的体质、惊人的意志和严格的训练。在这方面，波兰运动员是有良好的成绩的。前几天，三十六岁的波兰空军上尉杜拉创造的新纪录，轰动了全波兰。他在深夜从高速飞行在一万二千六百公尺高空的喷气式轰炸机上，在恶劣的气候条件和能见度极差的情况下跳下，在空中跌落了三分钟零十五秒，即跌落一万二千公尺后才把降落伞拉开。
    各式各样的滑翔机的表演，使人羡慕不止。数个人的、一个人的滑翔机凭着气流的力量或上或下或左或右的翻动。一队十二架“蝇”式滑翔机飞来了，它们同时在空中作翻斤斗动作，一会在观众头上排成一个大圆圈滑行，接着又一架架地在观众面前离地十几公尺滑翔而过。这些运动员大都是波兰航空俱乐部培养出来的，这样的航空俱乐部几乎遍布全国。
    明明刚看见远处有几个黑点，刹那间，喷气机群在人们头上一掠而过。两架喷气歼击机在空中战斗，喷气机群在空中编队，都十分吸引人。但是最引人兴味和最难表演的节目要算五架喷气机集体作各种翻滚动作。你看，这五架喷气机一齐飞来，一齐翻了斤斗，在阳光照耀下，金光闪闪地突然直冲天空，又作了半圆圈飞行，又一起横飞。内行说，这是波兰空军首次这样表演，以前只能做到三架喷气机作集体表演。这说明人民波兰的空军已经达到了很高的飞行水平。在历时三小时的飞行表演中，我们看到了各种各样的飞机。有喷气式歼击机和直升飞机，有轰炸机和救护机，也有教练机和滑翔机，而波兰空军以四百架喷气机作的“分列式”飞行，更给人以深刻印象。有关人士告诉我说，这些飞机都是波兰自己制造的。
    航空节检阅结束了。波兰国防部长斯彼哈尔斯基将军在贺词中说，波兰空军是“忠实于世界和平和社会主义国家友谊、捍卫波兰人民共和国的我们军队的骄傲。”波兰空军总司令弗雷—别累次基将军在节日前夕也说：“目前我们的空军不仅有庞大的数量，其质量也达到了世界空军国家的水平。”他们的这些话是意味深长的。人们知道，十八年前的今天，希特勒德国的漆着铁十字的轰炸机和战斗机闯入波兰上空，滥施暴虐，如入无人之境。这是每个成年的波兰人永记不忘的惨痛教训。但是今天人民波兰的空军已是足够保卫自己祖国安宁的铁鹰。如果说这是人民波兰的一项功绩，是绝不过份的。
