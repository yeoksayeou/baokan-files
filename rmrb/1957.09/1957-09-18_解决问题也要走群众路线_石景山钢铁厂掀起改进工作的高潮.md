　　Solving Problems Also Requires Following the Mass Line
　　Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Launches Upsurge in Improving Work
    (Our Newspaper) News report The Chinese Communist Party Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Committee recently studied the handling of mass opinions and problems in the rectification movement, and proposed to strengthen work in five aspects to ensure the quick and good handling of mass opinions and improvement of work. On the 16th, Party Committee Secretary Zhang Ping reported this situation to the Third Session of the First Employee Representative Congress of the plant.
    This plant's rectification movement, after the preparation stage and the great contending and blooming stage, has entered the stage of focusing on rectification and improvement, and an upsurge in improving work has been launched throughout the plant. As of September 14, the plant had handled 5,262 pieces of mass opinion, accounting for more than 20% of the opinions raised by employees. Through rectification and improvement while rectifying, many wasteful phenomena in production have been overcome, many defects in mechanical equipment have been eliminated, some backlogged rationalization proposals have been adopted, and the working conditions of workers have been greatly improved. The planning department, etc., appropriately simplified some forms and procedures, reducing unnecessary burdens on lower levels. Many problems in workers' welfare have been solved. The work style of many cadres has changed, and the relationship between leaders and the masses has become closer. Some employees who originally took a wait-and-see attitude toward the rectification movement have also invested in the movement with confidence. New atmospheres are constantly emerging in production, and many units have launched a production upsurge to complete the September production plan ahead of schedule and greet the National Day. However, because the masses put forward many opinions, the time is short, and the movement is developing rapidly, the current work of rectifying and improving while rectifying cannot meet the needs of the development of the situation. In particular, the following three issues need to be addressed.
    First, some units do not implement the mass line enough in the process of rectifying and improving, and when dealing with problems, they often only conduct research among a few leaders, and do not implement the spirit of layer-by-layer action and division of labor and responsibility; they do not fully mobilize and organize the masses to solve problems themselves; they do not absorb the proponents to jointly study the problem-solving methods. Therefore, they feel insufficient strength, and the handling of problems is not enough, not fast enough, and not good enough.
    Secondly, in the previous period, all units concentrated their efforts on dealing with the thousands of specific problems raised by the masses. Solving these specific problems is of course very important, but they did not simultaneously conduct a comprehensive analysis of the problems in the factory, and did not conduct in-depth discussions on the causes of the problems, but only "resolve whatever is expressed." Even among the problems that have been dealt with, some work has only decided to be improved, and no specific plan has been formulated; some problems have only arranged a plan, and have not been completely resolved; some people who have made mistakes have only admitted it first, and have not conducted in-depth self-examination ideologically. There may also be errors in the handling of some problems.
    Third, the development of the rectification movement in the plant is healthy, and the vast majority of employees have a correct understanding of the spirit of the rectification movement; however, among a few employees, phenomena of making unprincipled attacks on each other or excessively entangled in private life issues have also occurred in the contending and blooming. This should be corrected. Among cadres, the vast majority have a certain awareness of correctly handling contradictions among the people, and can humbly listen to the opinions of the masses and actively overcome shortcomings. However, there are also a few cadres who are afraid of exposing their shortcomings and mistakes and do not make serious self-criticism. This requires Party organizations to vigorously help them correct their attitudes, improve their ideological understanding, and guide them to actively participate in the rectification movement with sincerity.
    In order to quickly handle the various opinions raised by the masses in the rectification and further launch an upsurge in improving work in the plant, the Chinese Communist Party Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Committee believes that it is necessary to continue to follow the principle of diligence and thrift in running enterprises and overall planning and reasonable arrangement, pool the wisdom of the masses and take action together, and strengthen work in the following aspects:
    1. Divide responsibilities and mobilize all levels to solve problems. In addition to the plant-wide problems being reviewed and studied uniformly by the plant headquarters, problems that can be solved within the scope of each work section, workshop, and department should be actively studied and handled by each unit; problems of a professional nature should be solved by mobilizing employees in that profession to study them. When solving problems, proponents should be involved as much as possible to discuss them together.
    2. Each unit should conduct a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the opinions raised by employees, find out the causes of the problems, and fundamentally study ways to improve work. For some major issues, special forces should be organized to propose solutions. At present, the plant has established special groups for welfare and organizational structure issues, and each unit should also organize special research on major issues in their own unit.
    3. The opinions raised by employees must be accounted for one by one, and the opinions of the proposers on the problem-solving methods should be listened to. In addition to publicizing them in batches through the employee representative conference, each unit should publicize them at any time through big-character posters, forums, and mass meetings.
    4. For criticisms of cadres' work style, the criticized and critics should be organized to have comradely conversations, humbly accept correct criticisms, and make necessary explanations for misunderstandings in order to eliminate estrangement and enhance unity. This activity should generally be completed within September.
    5. Different opinions of employees on some issues in the contending and blooming should be unfolded for extensive discussion, so that the masses can distinguish in the discussion which views and opinions are correct and which are wrong.

### 解决问题也要走群众路线  石景山钢铁厂掀起改进工作的高潮

　　解决问题也要走群众路线
　　石景山钢铁厂掀起改进工作的高潮
    本报讯　中共石景山钢铁厂委员会最近研究了在整风运动中处理群众意见的情况和问题，提出要从五个方面加强工作，保证又快又好地处理群众意见，改进工作。16日，党委书记张萍同志把这一情况向该厂第一届第三次职工代表会议作了报告。
    这个厂的整风运动经过准备阶段和大鸣大放阶段，已经进入着重整改阶段，全厂掀起了改进工作的高潮。截至9月14日，全厂已经处理群众意见五千二百六十二件，占职工所提意见的20％以上。通过边整边改，许多生产中的浪费现象得到克服，不少机械设备上的缺陷得到消除，一些积压的合理化建议受到采纳，工人的劳动条件大为改善。计划科等适当简化了一些表报、手续，减轻了下面不必要的负担。许多工人生活福利方面的问题得到解决。不少干部的作风有了转变，领导与群众的关系更加密切。原来一部分对整风运动采取观望态度的职工，也满怀信心地投入运动中来。生产中新气象不断出现，许多单位都掀起了提前完成9月份生产计划、迎接国庆节的生产高潮。但是，由于群众提出的意见多、时间短、运动发展很快，目前边整边改的工作还不能满足形势发展的需要。特别是以下三个问题需要注意解决。
    首先，有些单位在边整边改中贯彻群众路线不够，在处理问题时，往往只限于在少数领导人员中进行研究，没有贯彻层层动手、分工负责的精神；没有充分发动和组织群众自己动手解决问题；没有吸收建议人共同研究问题处理办法。因此，感觉力量不足，处理问题不够多，不够快，不够好。
    其次，前一个时期，各单位都集中力量处理群众提出的千百个具体问题，解决这些具体问题当然是十分重要的，但是没有同时对工厂中的问题进行全面的分析，对问题产生的原因没有进行深入的探讨，只是“鸣什么，解决什么”。就是在已经处理的问题当中，有些工作也只是决定了要加以改进，还没有制定具体的方案；有些问题也只是安排了计划，还没有完全解决；有些犯错误的人也只是先承认了下来，还没有从思想上深入进行检查。对有些问题的处理，也还可能会有错误。
    第三，全厂整风运动的发展是健康的，绝大部分职工对于整风运动的精神有正确的认识；但是在少数职工之间，鸣放中也曾发生相互作无原则的攻击或者过多地纠缠在私生活问题上的现象。这是应当加以纠正的。在干部当中，绝大部分对于正确处理人民内部矛盾具有一定的自觉性，能够虚心听取群众意见，积极克服缺点。但是，也有少数干部害怕暴露自己的缺点和错误，不作认真的自我批评。这就需要党组织大力用诚心帮助他们端正态度，提高思想认识，引导他们积极参加整风运动。
    为了迅速处理整风中群众提出的各种意见，在全厂进一步掀起一个改进工作的高潮，中共石景山钢铁厂委员会认为，应当继续根据勤俭办企业和统筹兼顾、合理安排的原则，群策群力，大家动手，从以下几方面加强工作：
    一、分工负责，层层动手解决问题。除了全厂性的问题由厂部统一审查和研究外，属于各工段、车间、科室范围内可以解决的问题，应该由各单位主动地研究处理；属于各专业性质的问题，应当发动该专业的职工研究解决。在解决问题的时候，都应尽量吸收提意见的人共同商讨。
    二、各单位对职工提出的意见，要进行一次全面的系统的分析，找出产生问题的原因，从根本上研究改进工作的办法。对一些重大问题，要组织专门力量，提出方案。目前，全厂已就生活福利和组织机构等问题成立了专门小组，各单位也应就本单位的重大问题组织专题研究。
    三、对职工提出的意见，一定要作到件件有交代，并听取提意见人对问题处理办法的意见。除了通过职工代表会议分批公布以外，各单位应通过大字报、座谈会和群众大会等随时公布。
    四、凡是对干部作风的批评，应组织被批评者和批评者进行同志式的谈话，虚心接受正确的批评，对误解进行必要的解释，以消除隔阂，增进团结。这一活动一般的应于9月份内进行完毕。
    五、鸣放当中职工对有些问题的不同意见，应当展开广泛的讨论，让群众在讨论中辨别出哪些观点和意见是正确的，哪些观点和意见是错误的。
