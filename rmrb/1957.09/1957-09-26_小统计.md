	Small Statistics
	Composition of the Bridge
	It includes the Yangtze River Bridge, which is 1,670 meters long, the Han River Railway Bridge, which is 300 meters long, and the Han River Highway Bridge, which is 322 meters long, as well as ten overpasses in the urban area (totaling 480 meters in length), 12.8 kilometers of railway connecting lines, and 4.5 kilometers of highway connecting lines. The height of the bridge is approximately equal to a 20-story building.
	Construction Period and Cost
	The state originally stipulated that it should open to trains on October 1, 1958, and to cars in 1959. Now it has been fully completed, and the opening to traffic can be greatly advanced. The total investment was originally budgeted at 172.32 million yuan, but due to the implementation of the policy of diligence and thrift in construction, only 138.4 million yuan was used, saving 20%. The budgeted cost of the Yangtze River Bridge itself was 72.5 million yuan, but in reality, only 65.81 million yuan was used.
	Advanced Producers
	During the construction process, 3,167 advanced producers and 364 advanced units emerged across the bridge. 2,574 people submitted 2,693 rationalization proposals, of which 1,437 were adopted.
	Completed Engineering Volume
	It poured 126,300 cubic meters of concrete and reinforced concrete, installed 23,874 tons of steel beams, drove 3,000 concrete pipe piles, sank 224 large tubular columns, and also completed 1,536,496 cubic meters of earthwork and 355,434 cubic meters of stonework.
	Engineering Team
	During the construction of the bridge, 2,412 ordinary workers were trained as skilled workers, 90 technicians and interns were trained as engineers, 153 interns were trained as technicians, and 9 workers were trained as technicians. In addition, the skills of 4,461 workers and 801 engineers and technicians have been improved. This engineering team of thousands of people is now able to independently build large bridges using the world's latest technology.
	Foreign Guests and Reporters
	During the construction of the bridge, 4,383 foreign guests from 68 countries visited the Yangtze River Bridge, including the heads of state of Indonesia, the Soviet Union, and Vietnam. There were also 419 reporters, writers, photographers, and artists who came to the bridge construction site for interviews and to experience life.

    大桥的组成
    它包括全长一千六百七十公尺的长江大桥、三百公尺长的汉水铁路桥和三百二十二公尺长的汉水公路桥各一座，市区内的跨线桥十座（共长四百八十公尺）、铁路联络线十二点八公里和公路联络线四点五公里。桥的高度大约等于二十层的大楼。
    工期和造价
    国家原规定它在1958年10月1日通火车，1959年通汽车，现在它已经全部竣工，通车时间可以大大提前。它的总投资原预算为一亿七千二百三十二万元，由于贯彻勤俭建设的方针，只用了一亿三千八百四十万元，节约了20％。长江大桥本身的预算造价是七千二百五十万元，实际上只用了六千五百八十一万元。
    先进生产者
    在建设过程中，全桥涌现了先进生产者三千一百六十七名、先进单位三百六十四个。有二千五百七十四人提了二千六百九十三件合理化建议，采纳了一千四百三十七件。
    完成的工程量
    它浇筑了混凝土和钢筋混凝土十二万六千三百立方公尺，安装了钢梁二万三千八百七十四吨，打了混凝土管桩三千根，下沉了大型管柱二百二十四根，同时还作了一百五十三万六千四百九十六立方公尺的土方工程和三十五万五千四百三十四立方公尺的石方工程。
    工程队伍
    在大桥建设过程中，有二千四百一十二名普通工被培养成技术工人，有九十名技术员和实习生被培养成工程师，有一百五十三名实习生被培养成技术员，有九名工人被培养成技师，另外还有四千四百六十一名工人和八百零一名工程技术人员的技术有了提高。这支数千人的工程队伍，已经能独立地用世界上最新的技术来建设大型桥梁。
    外宾和记者
    在大桥建设过程中，有六十八个国家的外宾四千三百八十三人到长江桥头参观，其中包括印度尼西亚、苏联和越南三国的元首。到大桥工地采访和体验生活的记者、作家、摄影师、美术家等，也有四百一十九人。
