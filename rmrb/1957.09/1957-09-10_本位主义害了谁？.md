Whom Does Localism Harm?
By Our Reporter Shang Kai

At the Shanxi Province Grain Conference held in mid-August, I met Comrade Shen Tian, the Director of the Grain Bureau of Lu'an County. Shen Tian gave me the impression that he didn't like to conceal shortcomings in his work and was very frank in conversation. When the topic turned to the summer grain purchase situation in Lu'an County this year, he said, "It was a real pain." After a slight pause, he added, "Localism is really killing us!"

The story goes like this:

Last year, the wheat harvest in Lu'an County was generally not bad, except for some areas that suffered varying degrees of hail damage, with a total harvest of 20 million jin. At that time, the Changzhi Prefectural Commissioner's Office, based on the needs of the state and the local people's historical habit of eating little wheat, decided to purchase 6.18 million jin of wheat from Lu'an County. However, Lu'an County emphasized the severity of the disaster and the inadequacy of the people's rations, saying that they could only complete 3.5 million jin. Why did Lu'an County discount the state's purchase task? According to Comrade Shen Tian, the main idea in the leadership's mind at the time was to hope that the state would purchase less, so that the masses could distribute more, which would make it easier to talk to the masses, and the purchase task would also be easier to complete. Later, the state did reduce the purchase in Lu'an County by 2.68 million jin of wheat. The masses' wheat retention was greatly increased, with some cooperatives averaging 200 jin of wheat per person. Even the severely affected Dongyi Township agricultural cooperatives averaged 50 or 60 jin per person. The county's summer grain purchase task was completed very smoothly. If we look at this matter from the standpoint of localism, it can indeed be considered "a win-win situation." However, things often do not turn out as perfectly as imagined. As Comrade Shen Tian himself said, he did not expect it to cause serious consequences for the state, the masses, and this year's summer grain purchase work.

Let's look at the following facts:

Lu'an County's wheat production this year was lower than last year, with a total harvest of 18 million jin. The Changzhi Prefectural Commissioner's Office assigned Lu'an County a purchase task of 5.53 million jin. This figure is normal compared to previous years' purchase tasks. Since the purchase is being carried out according to the normal purchase task this year, the masses' wheat retention will naturally be reduced compared to last year, but each person will still retain about 30 to 70 jin, which should be considered normal when compared to the historical situation of the masses eating less wheat. However, due to the unprincipled reduction of the state purchase task last year and the blind increase in the masses' wheat retention, once the normal purchase task was restored, the masses felt that the state had lowered their living standards. Some farmers complained, "No matter what, we are retaining less wheat this year than last year." Grain work cadres explained to the masses, "It's not that you are retaining less wheat this year, it's that you retained too much wheat last year." But the masses did not appreciate the grain work cadres' explanation, and instead said, "Regardless of how much was retained last year, it was all given to us by you!" Many agricultural cooperatives, in order to keep up with last year and eat more wheat, came up with many ways to conceal production and deceive the state, which made the summer grain purchase work very difficult.

Let's take a look at another consequence caused by localism:

Last year, the masses were given more wheat, so naturally they were given less autumn grain after the autumn harvest. This situation is abnormal. Because eating fine grains (wheat) is more expensive than eating coarse grains, farmers in the individual economy period all knew that they should eat more coarse grains and less fine grains, and that coarse and fine grains should be adjusted. In order to save money, they often exchanged fine grains for coarse grains. But now that cooperation has been realized and the means of production are owned by the public, a sense of dependence on "asking the state for more after eating everything" is growing among the masses. The unprincipled retention of more wheat last year happened to cater to this kind of thinking. Therefore, after they distributed a large amount of wheat, the phenomenon of eating and drinking lavishly became widespread: eating only fine grains and not coarse grains, eating only dry food and not porridge. When the wheat was almost gone and the autumn grain distribution was not much, many households ran out of grain to eat by the spring of this year. Later, the state supplied a large amount of grain, which helped them to get through this man-made "spring famine."

The problem is very clear: the localism and one-sided mass viewpoint of the grain work cadres not only harmed the state and the masses, but also harmed themselves. Comrade Shen Tian received a very profound education from this matter. He deeply realized that if the masses are not educated and their socialist consciousness is not raised, but they are simply accommodated to the backward thinking of the masses, attempting to solve the contradiction between the interests of the state and the individual interests of the masses by giving the masses more grain to retain, it will not only not achieve good results, but on the contrary, it will further promote the selfish psychology of the masses, making the second step of work more and more passive and difficult, and causing more opinions and dissatisfaction among the masses towards the state.

After the grain conference ended, Comrade Shen Tian returned to Lu'an. On August 21, he called me long distance from Lu'an and told me that since they launched a major debate on grain issues in the county, with the improvement of the socialist consciousness of the masses, the summer grain purchase work in the county has progressed very rapidly, with 5.7 million jin of wheat already in storage, exceeding the summer grain purchase task for this year by 170,000 jin. He said, "You see how obvious it is! In grain work, the two different guiding ideologies of last year and this year have brought about two different effects."

### 本位主义害了谁？

    本位主义害了谁？
    本报记者　商恺
    在8月中旬召开的山西省粮食会议上，我遇到了潞安县粮食局长申田同志。申田给我的印象是，他不喜欢掩饰工作中的缺点，谈话非常坦率。当提到潞安县今年夏粮征购情况的时候，他说：“可费劲了。”稍停，他又补充了一句：“本位主义真是害死人！”
    事情原来是这样的：
    去年，潞安县的小麦，除部分地区遭受了程度不同的雹灾外，一般说来，收成还不坏，全县共收获了两千万斤。当时长治专署根据国家的需要，以及这个地区群众历年吃麦不多的习惯，决定从潞安县征购六百一十八万斤小麦。但是，潞安县却强调灾情严重，群众口粮不足，说他们只能完成三百五十万斤。潞安县为什么对接受国家征购任务要打折扣呢？据申田同志说：当时领导思想上主要是希图国家少征购一点，让群众多分一点，这样，对群众好说话，同时征购任务也容易完成。后来，国家在潞安县的确少征购了二百六十八万斤小麦。群众的小麦留量大大提高了，有些社每人平均分到二百斤小麦，受灾减产的东已乡几个农业社，每人也平均分到五、六十斤，全县夏粮征购任务，很顺利地完成了。如果站在本位主义的立场上来看这件事情，的确可算是“两全其美”了。可是，事情往往不如想像的那样美满，正如申田同志自己所说，没想到它竟给国家、给群众、给今年的夏粮征购工作，造成了严重的后果。
    让我们看下面的事实吧：
    潞安县今年小麦产量低于去年，共收获小麦一千八百万斤。长治专署分配给潞安县五百五十三万斤的征购任务。这个数字和历年的征购任务比较起来，是正常的。今年既然按照正常的征购任务进行征购，群众的小麦留量自然要比去年减少了，但每人也还保持三十斤到七十斤左右，这个数字如果和历史上群众吃麦较少的情况比较起来，也应该说是正常的。但是，由于去年无原则地降低了国家征购任务，盲目地提高了群众的小麦留量，一旦再恢复正常的征购任务，群众便认为国家降低了他们的生活标准了。一些农民不满意地说：“不管怎么说，反正我们今年留的小麦比去年少了。”粮食工作干部给群众进行解释：“不是今年留的小麦少，是去年留的小麦太多了。”但群众并不领粮食工作干部的情，反而说：“不管去年留多留少，都是你们给留的呀！”许多农业社为了和去年看齐，多吃小麦，想出了许多隐瞒产量、欺骗国家的办法，使夏粮征购工作遇到了很大困难。
    再来看一看本位主义造成的另一个后果：
    去年群众多分了小麦，秋后自然就少分了秋粮。这种情况是不正常的。因为，本来吃细粮（小麦）就比吃粗粮费的多，农民过去在个体经济时期，谁都懂得应该多吃粗粮，少吃细粮，粗细要调剂着吃；为了节约，他们还常常把细粮倒换成粗粮。可是现在合作化了，生产资料归了公，群众中滋长着“吃完了就向国家要”的依赖思想。去年无原则地多留了小麦，恰好投合了他们的这种思想。于是，当他们分了大量的小麦以后，比较普遍地发生了大吃大喝的现象：光吃细的，不吃粗的，光吃干的，不吃稀的。小麦快吃光了，秋粮分的又不多，到了今年春天，便有不少户断了吃粮。后来国家供应了大批粮食，才算渡过了这个人为的“春荒”。
    问题是很明显的：粮食工作干部的本位主义和片面的群众观点，不仅害了国家、害了群众，也害了自己。申田同志从这件事情中受到了很深刻的教育。他深深地体会到，对群众不进行教育，不去提高群众的社会主义觉悟，而一味地去迁就群众的落后思想，企图用给群众多留粮食的办法，去解决国家利益和群众的个人利益之间的矛盾，不但不会获得好的效果，相反地更助长了群众的自私心理，使第二步的工作越来越被动、越困难，而且引起了群众对国家更多的意见和不满。
    粮食会议结束以后，申田同志便回潞安去了。8月21日，他从潞安打长途电话告诉我：他们县自从开展粮食问题大辩论以后，随着群众的社会主义觉悟的提高，全县夏粮征购工作进展非常迅速，入库小麦已达五百七十万斤，超额十七万斤完成了今年的夏粮征购任务。他说：“你看多么明显啊！在粮食工作上，去年和今年两种不同的主导思想，带来了两种不同的效果。”
