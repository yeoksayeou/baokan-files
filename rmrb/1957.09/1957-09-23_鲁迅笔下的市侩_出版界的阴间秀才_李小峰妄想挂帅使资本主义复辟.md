Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 22nd -- A hidden right-wing clique's "commander" and mastermind in Shanghai's publishing circles has been exposed. This person is Li Xiaofeng, the so-called "tycoon" of the publishing world, once denounced by Lu Xun as a "philistine" for embezzling Lu Xun's huge royalties.

Before the high tide of socialist transformation, Li Xiaofeng came to the Shanghai Culture Publishing House as the deputy director of the editorial department. From then on, based on the small clique of the private Silians Publishing House, he actively cultivated his own power. After joining the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party last year, he not only actively implemented the policy of malignant development within the Shanghai Culture Publishing House, establishing strongholds and attacking the leadership of the Communist Party, but also vigorously developed organizations in Shanghai's cultural and artistic circles to expand his own power. During the great blooming and contending this year, Li Xiaofeng brazenly colluded with his clique's "military advisor" Xu Junyuan, "general" Qiu Biao, and others to plan an attack on the Communist Party, "taking command" in the cultural and publishing circles in order to restore capitalism. At the two anti-rightist symposiums in Shanghai's publishing circles on the 14th and 18th, participants exposed and refuted Li Xiaofeng's anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and deeds from various aspects.

The Li Xiaofeng right-wing clique, taking advantage of the rectification movement at the Shanghai Culture Publishing House, arrogantly attacked the prestige of the Communist Party and conspired to replace it. Li Xiaofeng described the socialist publishing industry as a complete mess. His clique spread rumors that the Shanghai Culture Publishing House was "bound to be divided." Li Xiaofeng also shamelessly incited an editor to nominate him as the director. Li Xiaofeng and Xu Junyuan conspired to establish a "Partners Publishing House" without the leadership of the Communist Party and drafted a so-called list of key members, all of whom were from their sectarian clique.

Participants also revealed that in order to establish his own privileges and realize his personal ambitions, Li Xiaofeng fabricated rumors and slandered Communist Party members and personnel work during the blooming and contending. The Communist Party member editors of the Shanghai Culture Publishing House were all below level ten (publishing level), but Li Xiaofeng deliberately spread rumors, saying: "Party members have privileges, and the minimum level for evaluation is level nine."

Participants exposed Li Xiaofeng's reactionary history, proving that this so-called "loyal elder" and "nice guy" who pretended to be progressive had long been nicknamed "old fox" and "underworld scholar" in the publishing world. Since pretending to be progressive, the Beixin Bookstore, founded by Li Xiaofeng, had embezzled Lu Xun's huge royalties. For more than 20 years, it had been relying on the Kuomintang and traitors, selling out national interests. During the Anti-Japanese War, Li Xiaofeng and his traitorous elder brother opened the Fuxingqi Company, which produced and sold the Wang puppet regime's "Blue Sky White Sun" flag with the reactionary slogan of "Peace, Anti-Communism, and National Construction." The ugly history of Beixin Bookstore, which Li Xiaofeng used to attack the people's publishing industry and boast about himself, shattered his lie that the publishing industry was "not as good as before" and made people see more clearly his sinister intention to restore capitalism.

After the anti-rightist struggle was launched at the Shanghai Culture Publishing House, right-wing elements such as Xu Junyuan and Qiu Biao had already been exposed, but the "commander" of this small clique, Li Xiaofeng, was still cleverly hidden. Participants pointed out that no cunning right-wing element can escape the net, and the anti-rightist struggle will not end until a complete victory is won.

### 鲁迅笔下的市侩　出版界的阴间秀才  李小峰妄想挂帅使资本主义复辟

    鲁迅笔下的市侩　出版界的阴间秀才
    李小峰妄想挂帅使资本主义复辟
    新华社上海22日电　上海出版界一个隐蔽着的右派小集团的“主帅”和幕后人被揭发出来了。这人就是曾经侵吞鲁迅先生巨额版税，被鲁迅斥为“市侩”的所谓出版界“巨头”李小峰。
    李小峰在社会主义改造高潮前夕到上海文化出版社担任编辑部副主任，从此以私营四联出版社的小宗派为基础，积极培植自己的势力。去年他参加农工民主党以后，不仅在上海文化出版社内积极执行了恶性大发展的方针，建立据点，打击共产党的领导，而且到上海文化艺术界大力发展组织，扩展自己的势力。今年大鸣大放中，李小峰明目张胆和他小集团的“军师”许君远、“大将”仇标等策划向共产党进攻，在文化出版界“挂帅”，以便使资本主义复辟。在14日、18日上海出版界的两次反右派座谈会上，与会者从各方面揭发和批驳了李小峰反共反社会主义的言行。
    李小峰右派小集团在上海文化出版社利用整风运动的机会，狂妄地打击共产党的威信，阴谋取而代之。李小峰把社会主义出版事业说得一团糟，他的小集团放出空气说，上海文化出版社“势在必分”；李小峰还厚颜无耻地鼓动一个编辑提他当社长。李小峰和许君远共谋，提出办不要共产党领导的“同仁出版社”，并且拟出了一份主要骨干都是他们宗派集团的所谓组社名单。
    与会者还揭发李小峰为了树立自己的特权，实现他个人的野心，在鸣放中造谣污蔑共产党员和人事工作。上海文化出版社的共产党员编辑级别都在十级以下（出版级），李小峰却故意造谣说：“党员有特权，评级最起码评九级。”
    与会者揭露了李小峰的反动历史，证明这个伪装进步的所谓“忠厚长者”、“好好先生”，早已在出版界获得了“老狐狸”和“阴间秀才”的绰号。李小峰所开办的北新书店自从伪装进步，侵吞了鲁迅先生的巨额版税后，二十多年中一直投靠国民党和汉奸，出卖民族利益。抗日战争时期，李小峰和他的汉奸大哥开办复兴旗子公司，制销汪伪青天白日旗，旗上有“和平反共建国”的反动口号。李小峰用以攻击人民出版事业、自我吹嘘的北新书店的丑恶历史，使他所制造的出版事业“今不如昔”的谎言不攻自破，使人们更加看清了他企图使资本主义复辟的险恶用心。
    上海文化出版社反右派斗争开展后，许君远、仇标等右派分子早已被揭露出来，但这个小集团的“主帅”李小峰却还巧妙地隐蔽着。与会者指出，任何狡猾的右派分子，决不能够漏网，反右派斗争不获全胜决不收兵。
