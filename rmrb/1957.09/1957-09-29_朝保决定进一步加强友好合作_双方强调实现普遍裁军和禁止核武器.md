Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 28th. The Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Kim Il-sung, and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, Yugov, signed a joint statement by the two governments in Pyongyang today.

The statement said that the two governments emphasized that the unification of Korea should be peacefully realized by the Korean people themselves on a democratic basis. The statement condemned the US imperialists for interfering in the internal affairs of the Middle Eastern countries and attempting to directly carry out military aggression against Syria. The statement said that the two governments once again expressed their unwavering support for the struggle of the Hungarian people, with the assistance of the Soviet Union and under the leadership of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, to consolidate the socialist system, and firmly opposed the so-called "Resolution of the Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly on the Hungarian Question" manufactured by imperialist countries to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs.

The statement emphasized that the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations should be restored without delay, and that Taiwan, the territory of the People's Republic of China, should be returned to it peacefully.

The statement emphasized the need to achieve universal disarmament and the unconditional prohibition of nuclear weapons. The statement said that the two governments fully support the Soviet government's proposal to stop nuclear weapons testing and other specific programs on disarmament issues.

The statement expressed full support for the consistent efforts of the German Democratic Republic to peacefully resolve the German issue on a democratic basis. The statement emphasized that obstacles created by the South Vietnamese government, with the support of the United States, on the road to Vietnam's unification should be eliminated, and that the unification of Vietnam should be realized in accordance with the Geneva Agreements on Indochina.

The statement said that the unity and solidarity of the countries in the socialist camp is a reliable and important factor for the victorious development of all countries building socialism, and an important guarantee for defending the socialist cause and maintaining world peace. The statement said that during the visit of the government delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria to Korea, the two governments held talks, extensively exchanged views on further strengthening and developing friendly relations between the two countries and a series of international issues, and reached complete agreement. The two governments also signed a long-term trade agreement for 1958 to 1960 and a protocol on exchange of goods and payments for 1958.
