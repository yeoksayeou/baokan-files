Xinhua News Agency, London, September 21st: The Office of the Chargé d'Affaires of the People's Republic of China in London today issued another statement regarding the conspiracy to have the so-called "Taiwan Chinese Classical Theater Troupe" perform in Britain. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    Certain British officials, some reports and commentaries in British newspapers, and the agents responsible for arranging the performance of Chiang Kai-shek's Air Force Peking Opera Troupe, have all tried to portray the political conspiracy of having Chiang Kai-shek's Air Force troupe perform in Britain as a purely "private commercial matter," and have accused this Office of adding political overtones to an artistic performance.

    But is the current issue a purely "private commercial matter"? Even a London dispatch published in the "Irish Times" on September 14 pointed out that it cannot be assumed that the British Consulate in Taiwan issued passports on its own initiative. Everyone knows that this troupe flew to London on a special plane from the Chiang Kai-shek clique. It is equally obvious that its arrival in Britain was with the approval of the British authorities. When the troupe disembarked at London Airport, the flag of the Chiang Kai-shek clique was displayed. Furthermore, during the troupe's initial performance on September 16, the Chiang Kai-shek national anthem and the British national anthem were played, and the entire audience (including British cabinet ministers) stood at attention. In light of all this, can we conclude that this is purely a "private commercial matter"?

    Moreover, is the sole purpose of the troupe's visit truly to conduct artistic performances? Everyone knows that this so-called "professional" troupe has consistently been carrying out the tasks of the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force's propaganda team. As recently as July this year, the troupe, led by a Chiang Kai-shek colonel-level officer, visited South Korea under the name of the "Republic of China National Opera Arts Performance Group." Even now, the members of the troupe in London are living under strict military discipline. According to Chiang gang's Central News Agency, on the eve of the troupe's departure for Britain, all members were received by Chiang Kai-shek himself, accompanied by Wang Shu-ming, the current Chief of Staff of Chiang Kai-shek and former Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force. Yu Hung-chun, the President of Chiang Kai-shek's Executive Yuan, also personally addressed the troupe members, instructing them to intensify their subversive activities against the new China. The troupe has faithfully followed these instructions, doing everything possible since arriving in London, and continues to do so, to carry out its mission.

    Therefore, who is it that is mixing politics and art? Certainly not the government and people of the People's Republic of China. We have always advocated cultural exchanges and friendly contact between peoples and countries. We firmly believe that these activities should be conducted on the basis of mutual respect and non-interference in internal affairs. These activities should be aimed at promoting mutual understanding and friendship, and should never be used to undermine national dignity, disrupt national unity, interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, or create animosity towards other countries. These are practices we resolutely oppose. The visit of the Chinese Art Troupe to Britain in 1955, and the current visit of the Lambert Ballet to China, clearly demonstrate the sincere desire of the Chinese government and people to promote normal cultural exchanges.

    Everyone knows that Taiwan is a province of China. If a truly popular theatrical troupe from Chinese Taiwan were to perform abroad in the name of Taiwan Province or a locality in China, that would be an entirely different matter. But the so-called "Chinese Classical Theater Troupe" now performing in Britain is not this at all.

    Firstly, as mentioned above, it is not a popular troupe, but a propaganda unit of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's Air Force. Secondly, it is not performing in the name of Taiwan Province of the People's Republic of China, a local name. It openly displays the banner of the so-called "Republic of China" and was flown here by special plane for the purpose of carrying out political activities that betray the motherland and undermine China's national unity. Therefore, the nature of this activity is clearly not to exchange culture and promote friendly relations between the Chinese and British peoples. On the contrary, its purpose is to poison Sino-British relations and create "two Chinas" to interfere in China's internal affairs. Of course, this cannot be lightly regarded as a "private commercial matter" or as something "unrelated to politics." This incident clearly shows who is actually adding political overtones to artistic activities.

    Therefore, this Office deems it necessary to reiterate that the Chinese government and the Chinese people resolutely oppose this so-called "Chinese Classical Theater Troupe" engaging in harmful political activities in Britain under the guise of artistic performance. We must expose the truth of this political conspiracy, a conspiracy that is hostile to China and poisons Sino-British relations that have been built up over the past few years with great effort and patience. We believe that the British people will not be deceived, nor will they agree to this conspiracy that is detrimental to Sino-British relations.

    蒋帮剧社在英演出毒化中英关系
    我驻英代办揭露敌视中国的阴谋
    新华社伦敦21日电　中华人民共和国驻伦敦代办处今天又发表了关于让所谓“台湾中国古典剧团”在英国演出的阴谋的声明。声明全文如下：
    某些英国官员、英国报纸上的一些消息和评论以及主持蒋介石空军京剧团上演事宜的代理人在“曼彻斯特卫报”上发表的声明，都竭力要把让蒋介石空军的剧团在英国演出的政治阴谋，说成是纯粹“私人商业事务”，并且指责本代办处在艺术演出上加上政治色彩。
    可是目前的问题是一个纯粹“私人商业事务”的问题吗？连9月14日“爱尔兰泰晤士报”登载的伦敦消息也指出，不能认为，英国驻台湾领事馆是自己作主发给护照的。大家都知道，这个剧团是乘蒋介石集团的专机飞抵伦敦的。同样明显的是，它来英国是得到英国当局的赞同的。当这个剧团在伦敦机场下飞机的时候，还挂出了蒋介石集团的旗帜。并且在这个剧团在9月16日初次演出的时候，演奏了蒋介石国歌以及英国国歌，这时观众（其中有英国内阁大臣）全体肃立。从这一切来看，难道我们能得出结论说这纯粹是“私人商业事务”吗？
    此外，难道该剧团访问的唯一目的真是进行艺术表演吗？大家都知道，这个所谓“职业”剧团一直是在执行着蒋介石空军的宣传队的任务。就在今年7月间，该剧团还曾在蒋介石一个上校级军官的率领下，以“中华民国国剧艺术演出团”的名义访问过南朝鲜。甚至现在，该剧团的团员在伦敦都还是按照严格的军事纪律生活的。根据蒋帮中央社消息，该剧团在动身来英国的前夕，全体团员还在蒋介石的现任参谋长、前空军总司令王叔铭的陪同下受到蒋介石本人的接见。蒋介石行政院院长俞鸿钧也亲自给团员们讲话，指示他们要加紧对新中国进行颠覆活动。该剧团忠实地遵奉这些指示，在抵伦敦后尽了而且现在还在尽一切可能执行它的任务。
    因此，究竟是谁把政治和艺术问题混淆起来的呢？当然不是中华人民共和国政府和人民。我们始终主张各国人民和各国之间进行文化交流和友好接触。我们坚决认为，这些活动应当根据互相尊重和互不干涉内政的原则来进行。进行这些活动，应当是为了促进互相了解和友谊为目的，而决不能利用这些活动来损害国家尊严、破坏国家的统一、干涉其他国家内政和制造对其他国家的恶感。这些是我们坚决反对的做法。1955年中国艺术团访问英国，以及目前兰伯特芭蕾舞剧团访问中国，清楚地表明了中国政府和人民希望促进正常的文化交流的真诚愿望。
    人人都知道，台湾是中国的一个省份。如果有一个中国台湾的真正民间性的戏剧团体以台湾省或中国某地方的名义在外国演出，那事情就完全不同。但现在在英国演出的所谓“中国古典剧团”却完全不是这回事。
    首先，上面已经说过，它不是什么民间性剧团，而是蒋介石集团空军的一个宣传团体。第二、它不是以中华人民共和国台湾省这种地方性的名义演出的。它公然打着所谓“中华民国”的招牌，并由专机送到这里来，目的是要进行背叛祖国和破坏中国国家统一的政治活动。因此，这种活动的性质显然不是交流文化和促进中英两国人民的友谊关系。恰恰相反，它的目的是要毒化中英关系，和制造“两个中国”来干涉中国的内政。当然不能把这个轻率地看成是“私人商业事务”，或者看成是某种“同政治无关的”事情。从这件事可以清楚看出，是谁在实际上把政治色彩加到艺术活动上去的。
    因此，本代办处认为有必要重申，中国政府和中国人民坚决反对这个所谓“中国古典剧团”在英国借着艺术表演之名从事有害的政治活动。我们必须揭露这种政治阴谋的真相，这种阴谋是敌视中国和毒化在过去几年中经过很大努力和耐心建立起来的中英关系的。我们相信，英国人民不会受到蒙蔽，也不会同意这种有害于中英关系的阴谋活动。
