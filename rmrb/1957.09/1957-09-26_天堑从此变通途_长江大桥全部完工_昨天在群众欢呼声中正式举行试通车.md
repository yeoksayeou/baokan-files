Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project was fully completed on September 25th and officially opened for trial operation today. This project is one of the major construction projects in China's First Five-Year Plan. After acceptance by the state acceptance and handover committee, the project will soon be put into use.

The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project was officially started in September 1955, following the Hanshui Railway Bridge project. Under the leadership of the Party and the government and with the support of the people of the whole country, Chinese railway workers spent only two years to successfully complete this unprecedentedly huge bridge project, nearly two years ahead of the schedule stipulated in China's Five-Year Plan.

During the construction of this bridge, with the help of Soviet experts, all the workers, for the first time, replaced the pneumatic caisson method, which was commonly used in bridge construction in the past, with the large-scale pipe column drilling method. This overcame the limitation of intermittent construction of the foundation project due to high water levels, allowing construction to proceed non-stop throughout the year, thereby greatly shortening the completion date of the bridge. At the same time, experience has proven that this deep-water foundation construction method can also be widely used in other water conservancy projects and industrial construction projects.

Currently, all the workers of the Bridge Engineering Bureau are actively rushing to repair the Wuchang bank riverside sidewalks, cleaning the site, and greening the bridgehead to celebrate the opening of the bridge.

Our newspaper Wuhan, September 25th: The newly completed Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was officially opened for trial operation this morning, receiving more than 1,500 people, including party, government, and military leaders of Hubei Province and Wuhan City, as well as people from all walks of life. More people of Wuhan had also gathered early on Turtle Mountain and Snake Mountain on both sides of the bridge to watch the trial operation.

After gathering at the Wuchang Bridge Pavilion, the people participating in the trial operation took the elevator down to the railway bridge deck and walked across the river along the sidewalks on both sides of the railway. At nine o'clock, everyone rode a train composed of seventeen carriages hanging a huge portrait of Chairman Mao, passing over the bridge from Hanyang. At this time, a burst of stormy applause rang out from the Hanyang bank's approach bridge and Turtle Mountain, which was close to the approach bridge. Then, people took cars on the Wuchang side, crossed the river on the highway bridge deck, and drove over the Hanshui Highway Bridge to the vicinity of the Hankou Wuhan Customs, where the citizens warmly welcomed them along the road. After the trial operation, they watched scientific and technological films on the foundation construction and steel beam construction of the Yangtze River Bridge at the Seamen's Club.

Before this official trial operation, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge had also held an informal trial operation in mid-August and a strict scientific appraisal in early September. According to the appraisers, the quality of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is very good. This conclusion was once again proved in today's trial operation.

This morning, there was a strong wind of force five on the river, with surging waves and few ships sailing. But people walked freely on the bridge without any impact. The Yangtze River, which had hindered north-south transportation, has now become an unobstructed thoroughfare. Li Yiqing, general manager of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, told reporters: "Wuhan Iron and Steel Company needs to transport two to three million tons of raw materials (including coal and refractory material raw materials) from the north every year, and also transport hundreds of thousands of tons of finished products to the north. Relying solely on the current ferry transfer across the river, the transportation capacity is small and often hindered by wind and waves, which is difficult to meet the production requirements of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company. Now that the Yangtze River Bridge has been built, the transportation of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company's materials can be timely, transportation costs can be reduced, and construction and production costs can also be reduced. The completion of the Yangtze River Bridge has great significance for China's economic construction."

General Zheng Xiaofeng, who participated in the first batch of soldiers crossing the river to liberate Wuchang, also talked about the situation of crossing the river to pursue the enemy. He said: At that time, only wooden boats crossed the river at first, and it took an hour to cross once, which was very slow. Seeing the enemy fleeing south of the Yangtze River, there was no way to pursue them. Later, a ship was found, which was slightly faster. He said: "From then on, the soldiers were discussing: a bridge should be built on the river. Now, the Yangtze River Bridge has been built. This is of great significance for both national defense transportation and people's transportation." Shi Jingren, an old worker with 39 years of experience and who has built more than 300 bridges, said happily: The force-five winds and waves on the river would have hindered the foundation construction a year ago, "Now that the Yangtze River Bridge is built, we are not afraid of how big the wind and waves are."

### 天堑从此变通途  长江大桥全部完工  昨天在群众欢呼声中正式举行试通车

    天堑从此变通途
    长江大桥全部完工
    昨天在群众欢呼声中正式举行试通车
    新华社25日讯　武汉长江大桥工程已在9月25日全部完工，今天正式举行试通车。这项工程是我国第一个五年计划中主要建设项目之一。这个工程经过国家验收交接委员会验收后，即将交付使用。
    武汉长江大桥工程是继汉水铁桥工程之后，在1955年9月正式开工的。我国铁路职工在党和政府的领导下以及全国人民的支援下，仅用了两年的时间就把我国前所未有的巨大桥梁工程，根据我国五年计划规定提前近两年胜利地完成了。
    在这座大桥施工过程中，全体职工在苏联专家帮助下，第一次以大型管柱钻孔法代替了过去建桥常用的压气沉箱法，克服了基础工程施工因高水位间歇施工的限制，一年四季不停的施工，从而大大缩短了大桥完工日期。同时根据经验证明，这种深水基础施工方法，还可以推广到其他水利工程和工业建设工程中去广泛使用。
    目前，大桥工程局全体职工为了庆祝大桥通车，正在积极赶修武昌岸沿江人行道，进行场地清理和桥头的绿化工作。
    本报武汉25日电　刚竣工的武汉长江大桥在今天上午正式试通车，接待了湖北省和武汉市的党、政、军负责人和各界人士一千五百多人。更多的武汉人民，也很早就聚集在大桥两端的龟山和蛇山上等待观看试通车。
    参加试通车的人们在武昌桥亭聚齐后，即乘电梯下到铁路桥面，沿着铁路两旁的人行道步行过江。九点钟，大家乘着一列挂着毛主席巨像的、由十七个车厢组成的火车从汉阳驶过大桥。这时，汉阳岸的引桥和紧靠着引桥的龟山上下，响起了一片暴风雨般的掌声。接着，人们又在武昌改乘汽车由公路桥面过江，并驶过汉水公路桥到达汉口武汉关附近，市民群众夹道热烈欢迎。试通车后，他们在海员俱乐部看了长江大桥基础施工和钢梁施工的科学技术影片。
    在举行这次正式的试通车以前，武汉长江大桥还先后在8月中旬举行过非正式的试通车，在9月上旬举行过严格的科学鉴定。据鉴定人员谈，武汉长江大桥的质量是很好的。这种结论在今天的试通车中又一次地得到了证明。
    今天上午，江上刮着五级巨风，浪涛汹涌，行船很少。但人们却自由行走在大桥上，不受任何影响。阻碍南北交通的长江天堑至此变成畅行无阻的通途了。武汉钢铁公司总经理李一清向记者说：“武钢每年要从北方运来二三百万吨原料（包括煤和耐火材料的原料），还要向北方运数十万吨成品，光靠目前的轮渡转载过江，运力小，还时常受风浪阻挠，很难适应武钢生产要求。现在，长江大桥建设起来了，今后武钢物资的运输可以及时，运费可以减少，建设和生产成本也可以降低。长江大桥的建成对我国经济建设具有重大的意义。”
    参加首批过江解放武昌的郑效峰将军也谈到渡江追击敌人的情况。他说：当时，最初只有木船过江，一小时才过一趟，很慢，眼看江南的敌人逃跑了，也没有办法追击。后来找到一艘轮船，才稍微快些。他说：“从那时起，战士们就在议论：要在江上修桥。现在，长江大桥修起来了。这无论对国防运输和人民交通都有很大作用。”有三十九年工龄、修过三百多座桥的老工人石景仁兴高采烈地谈到：江上刮的五级风浪，一年前还会妨碍基础施工，“现在，长江大桥修好了，刮多大的风浪也不怕了。”（附图片）
