    Uprooting the Stronghold of Chen Yangzhi's Rightist Clique
    Luo Jiangyun's Reactionary Features Exposed
    The reactionary features of the rightist Luo Jiangyun (female) of Qingdao No. 2 Middle School in Shandong Province have been exposed.
    The rightist Luo Jiangyun was a stronghold established in Qingdao No. 2 Middle School by the rightist clique headed by Chen Yangzhi, Deputy Director of the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League. She vehemently opposed all previous political movements, and especially hated the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement. She spread rumors that the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement had "excesses that were very common," and she advocated establishing a "Rehabilitation Committee" to "seek justice for those who have been wronged." In order to show loyalty to the rightist clique headed by Chen Yangzhi, she also actively attacked the Qingdao Daily, proposing that the democratic parties jointly run a "Sunday Supplement," attempting to seize the Party's propaganda front.

    拔除陈仰之右派集团的据点
    罗江云反动面貌被揭露
    山东青岛市第二中学右派分子罗江云（女）的反动面貌，已被揭露出来。
    右派分子罗江云，是以民盟青岛市委副主任委员陈仰之为首的右派集团安设在青岛第二中学的一个据点。她极力反对历次政治运动，特别对肃反运动更加仇视。她造谣说肃反运动“过火现象十分普遍”，她主张成立“平反委员会”为“含冤受屈者伸冤”。为了效忠于以陈仰之为首的右派集团，她还积极攻击青岛日报，提议由民主党派合办“星期日刊”，企图夺取党的宣传阵地。
