Xinhua News Agency, 14th — "The friendship between the people of China and Bulgaria knows no distance and cannot be weakened or destroyed by any imperialists or enemies of socialism and peace," said Anton Yugov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, upon his arrival in Beijing today.

The government delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, headed by Yugov, arrived in Beijing by jet plane at 2:30 p.m. today for a friendly visit to our country at the invitation of our government. The delegation was warmly welcomed at Beijing Airport by Premier Zhou Enlai and people from all walks of life in Beijing.

As the special plane carrying the distinguished guests slowly landed in the clear sky, prolonged cheers and applause erupted from the welcoming crowd standing beneath countless colorful flags. After Premier Zhou Enlai accompanied Yugov and the Bulgarian government delegation to review the guard of honor, enthusiastic Young Pioneers of Beijing presented the distinguished guests with flowers.

In his speech at the airport, Yugov said, "Close fraternal friendship connects the people of our two countries. This friendship is unbreakable because it is based on the common goal of building socialism, on the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, and on the principles of international solidarity and proletarian internationalism."

He said: "Under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party, the working people of China, together with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, have established fraternal friendship and comprehensive cooperation, and have achieved tremendous success in the socialist transformation of their country in a short period of time. We are heartily pleased with this."

Yugov also said, "Our visit to China will help further develop the friendship and cooperation between Bulgaria and China, will help strengthen the unbreakable unity of the socialist camp headed by our common friend and ally—the great Soviet Union—and will help strengthen peace and cooperation among all peoples of the world."

Before Yugov's speech, Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech warmly welcoming the Bulgarian government delegation. He said: "The People's Republic of Bulgaria is the motherland of the outstanding communist fighter Comrade Dimitrov and a strong member of the socialist camp. The diligent, brave, and loyal Bulgarian people, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the government, have made great achievements in the cause of socialist construction and safeguarding world peace. The Chinese people are delighted and encouraged by these achievements of the Bulgarian people."

"The people of China and Bulgaria have always had a deep fraternal friendship. In recent years, our two countries' friendly cooperation in political, economic, and cultural fields has been developing in an increasingly comprehensive manner. This cooperation is of great significance to our common cause of building socialism and defending world peace."

Zhou Enlai also said: "We are deeply convinced that this visit by the government delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria to our country will further consolidate and develop the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries, and will help strengthen the unity of socialist countries and safeguard the noble cause of world peace."
