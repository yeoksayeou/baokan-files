　　Hebei Province's plan to launch a large-scale mass water conservancy construction movement this autumn and winter and next year has been approved at the recent Provincial People's Congress. Currently, various localities are training cadres, organizing visits for observation, strengthening engineering survey and design, and making construction preparations, as well as widely carrying out publicity for water conservancy construction. After the autumn harvest, various localities will begin constructing water conservancy projects.

    According to the requirements of the plan, Hebei Province will actively construct various water conservancy projects this autumn and winter and next year to increase the effectiveness of flood prevention, drainage, and drought prevention. These projects mainly include: The Gangnan Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Hutuo River will begin construction next year and is expected to play a flood control role in 1960. In terms of river management projects, the expansion project of the Sinvsi River flood diversion channel will be completed, and protection projects for the Zhang River and Yongding River, as well as the repair of dikes along various rivers, will be carried out. In the plain areas, based on the principle of combining storage and drainage and considering both upstream and downstream, farmers will be mobilized to construct various drainage projects such as ditches, furrows, and cultivated fields according to local conditions, and at the same time, some key low-lying drainage and irrigation projects will be undertaken. After these projects are completed, they can control a drainage area of more than 3,000 square kilometers, develop about 500,000 mu of paddy fields, and implement crop rotation in low-lying areas. The entire province will dig 100,000 various water wells and deepen 50,000 old wells. The medium-sized and small-scale irrigation projects constructed by farmers and the large-scale irrigation projects undertaken by the state can expand the irrigated area by about 5 million mu. The content of soil and water conservation work in mountainous areas is to build 1,000 medium-sized and small-scale reservoirs, which, in addition to controlling some floods, can also expand the irrigated area by 500,000 mu; through the construction of check dams, terraces, and contour ditches, combined with agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry measures, a drainage area of about 6,000 square kilometers can be controlled. At the same time, projects to provide drinking water for 120,000 people in mountainous areas will be constructed. In addition, it is necessary to strengthen the repair, management, and utilization of existing water conservancy projects, tap their potential, and give full play to their benefits, further enhancing the ability to prevent disasters and protect production.

　　河北秋后将大兴水利
    新华社讯  河北省今年秋冬和明年开展大规模的群众性水利建设运动的计划，已经在最近一次省人民代表大会上通过。目前各地正在着手训练干部，组织参观，加强工程勘测设计，进行施工准备，并广泛展开水利建设的宣传。秋收以后，各地将动手兴修水利。
    按照计划的要求，河北省将在今年秋冬和明年积极兴修各项水利工程，增加防洪、防涝和防旱的效能。这些工程主要有：滹沱河上游岗南水库明年动工修建，预计在1960年发挥拦洪作用。河道治理工程方面，完成四女寺减河扩建工程，进行漳河、永定河护险工程，以及各河堤防修整工程。平原地区根据蓄泄兼施、上下兼顾的原则，发动农民因地制宜地兴修沟洫畦田等多种防涝工程，同时重点举办一些洼地排水灌溉工程。这些工程完成后，可以控制流域面积三千多平方公里，发展约五十万亩稻田，并进行洼地作物改种。全省要打各种水井十万眼，锥深旧井五万眼。农民兴修的中、小型灌溉工程和国家举办的大型灌溉工程，共可以扩大灌溉面积五百万亩左右。山区水土保持工作的内容是，修建中、小型水库一千座，除控制部分洪水外，还可以扩大灌溉面积五十万亩；通过修谷坊、梯田、水平沟等，配合农、林、牧业的措施，可以控制流域面积六千平方公里左右。同时，修建十二万山区人口吃水用的工程。此外，要加强对原有各项水利工程的修整、管理、运用，挖掘潜力，使之充分发挥效益，进一步增强防灾、保产的能力。
