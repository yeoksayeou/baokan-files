　　We Don't Want Capitalist "Freedom"!
　　Shiqi Agricultural Cooperative Members Clarify Right and Wrong in a Great Debate

Xinhua News Agency News: During the great debate in the Shiqi Agricultural Cooperative in Zhoujun Township, Xinhui County, Guangdong, cooperative member Ru Xianyang said: "After the cooperativization, farmers have no 'freedom' in clothing, food, housing, and transportation. We need a cloth ration card to make clothes; we need ration cards to eat more pork, oil, and sugar; if we want to live in the city, we can't go without approval to transfer our household registration; sometimes when we take a bus to the city, we wait and wait and can't buy a ticket."

"What kind of freedom is he talking about? What kind of freedom do we need?" The cooperative held many large and small debates, including cadre meetings, youth meetings, women's meetings, and member meetings, to clarify the major issues of right and wrong.

Poor peasant Ru Boxiang said: "If we say that there is not enough freedom in making clothes, that is just a statement made by a minority of people. Most farmers wear more clothes than they did in the past." The cooperative members did the math: out of 110 households and 404 people in the entire cooperative, only 98 people could afford to wear relatively good clothes before liberation, and many people wore tattered clothes. Now everyone has good clothes to wear; before liberation, no one wore Zhongshan suits, but now 52 people wear them; before liberation, only 131 people wore shoes, but now 319 people wear them. The cooperative members believe that the socialist freedom of everyone having clothes to wear is much better than the "freedom" of the minority of people in the past who didn't need cloth ration cards.

Let's recall the so-called "freedom of food" in the old society! At that time, grain, oil, and sugar were all freely traded, with no "restrictions," but what was the result? An old farmer in the cooperative calculated this: In 1943, 93 people starved to death in Shiqi Village, including 28 families who starved to death as a whole; 9 people sold their children, and 5 people were displaced and became beggars. Doesn't this fact prove that landlords and unscrupulous merchants had the "freedom" to hoard and speculate, while the peasants only had the "freedom" to starve to death? The cooperative members believe that now every household keeps enough food rations, but only lacks the "freedom" of the spontaneous capitalist ideology of keeping more food regardless of the state plan.

"Speaking of housing, we now live in peace and comfort," middle peasant Ru Ningwei retorted Ru Xianyang's fallacy of so-called "lack of freedom in housing" by saying, "Before liberation, thieves often came to steal things, how could we live in peace? My family had four small boats stolen, and once a new boat we had just bought was also stolen." Why does Ru Xianyang want to live in the city? He did not give a reason. If all the peasants blindly flocked to the cities, what would everyone eat?

When debating the issue of "travel," Ru Zhenye retorted Ru Xianyang: "In the past, when we took buses, it was not a question of freedom or lack of freedom. We simply didn't have the money to take the bus. Now there are more people taking the bus, which is a good phenomenon. Why curse the lack of freedom just because you have to wait a bit for the bus?" Ru Xianyang was speechless.

The great debate clarified right and wrong, and the cooperative members knew that we need socialist freedom and do not need capitalist "freedom." Many cooperative members returned the extra grain they had been allocated and completed the cooperative's task of selling surplus grain. (Liang Guangzhong)

### 我们不要资本主义的“自由”！  石?农业社的社员在大辩论中辨明了是非

　　我们不要资本主义的“自由”！
　　石?农业社的社员在大辩论中辨明了是非
    新华社讯  在广东新会县周郡乡石?农业社的大辩论中，社员茹显扬说：“合作化后，农民的衣、食、住、行都没有‘自由’，做衣服要布证；想多吃一些猪肉、油、糖又都要证；想到城市去住，不批准迁户籍就不能去；有时搭车进城，等来等去都买不到车票。”
    “他说的是什么样的自由？我们需要些什么样的自由？”该社召开干部会、青年会、妇女会、社员大会等进行了多次的大小辩论，辨明了大是大非。
    贫农茹柏祥说：“如果说做衣服不够自由，那只是少数人的说法，大多数农民穿的衣服是比过去多了。”社员们算了算账：全社一百一十户，四百零四人，解放前只有九十八人穿得上比较好的衣服，有很多人穿的是破烂不堪的，现在大家都有好衣服穿了；解放前没有人穿中山装，现在有五十二人穿；解放前只有一百三十一人穿鞋，现在有三百一十九人穿了。社员认为人人有衣穿的社会主义自由比过去不用布证的少数人“自由”好得多。
    回忆一下旧社会所谓“食的自由”吧！那时粮食、油、糖都自由买卖，没有“限制”，但结果怎样呢？该社的老农算了这样一笔账：1943年石?村就饿死了九十三人，其中有二十八户是全家饿死的；出卖儿女的有九人，流离失所和做乞丐的有五人。这事实不是证明了地主、奸商有囤积居奇的“自由”，农民只有饿死的“自由”吗？社员认为现在户户都留够口粮，只是没有不顾国家计划而多留粮食的资本主义自发思想的“自由”罢了。
    “说到住，我们现在住得安乐了”，中农茹宁威反驳茹显扬的所谓“住不自由”的谬论时说：“在解放前，盗贼经常来偷东西，那能住得安宁，我家就被偷了四条小船，有一次刚买了一条新船也被偷了。”茹显扬为什么要去城市住呢？他没有说出理由。如果农民都要盲目流入城市，大家吃什么？
    辩论到“行”的问题时，茹振业反驳茹显扬说：“以前我们搭汽车不是自由不自由的问题，我们根本没有钱搭车；现在搭车的人多了，这是好现象，为什么要等一下车就骂不自由呢？”茹显扬无言可答。
    大辩论辨明了是非，社员们知道：我们需要社会主义的自由，不需要资本主义的“自由”。很多社员都把多分的粮食退出来，完成了全社的卖余粮任务。  （梁光中）
