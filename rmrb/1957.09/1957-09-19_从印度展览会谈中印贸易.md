The Indian Exhibition opens in Beijing today, which will make a significant contribution to promoting Sino-Indian trade and Sino-Indian friendship. In the past, our country participated in commodity exhibitions in Mumbai in the spring of 1952 and New Delhi in the winter of 1955. Now we congratulate the Indian Exhibition on its first opening in China.

In the mid-nineteenth century, British imperialists created a route from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. British shipping companies began to build a comprehensive railway network in the interior of India. At the same time, Indian crops were gradually commercialized under heavy British taxes to supply the industrial raw materials needed by Britain. Since then, modern commerce has appeared in India. The foundation of India's modern industry is the textile industry, which developed independently during the First World War when transportation between Europe and Asia was blocked. Calcutta and Mumbai are already two large-scale modern industrial zones. The former has more than a hundred factories producing jute and jute products. The latter has more developed light industry, with more than two hundred cotton textile factories alone. In addition, there are more than ten cities with modern industries.

Since India's independence, the Indian government and people have made great efforts to develop the national economy. After the first five-year plan, India's agricultural and industrial production has increased. Now, India is beginning to implement its second five-year plan, which focuses on the development of heavy industry.

However, this exhibition does not represent the full extent of the development of India's modern industry. For example, the acid-making industry is a basic industry, but its products are not on display. The scale of construction in the two five-year plans can only be inferred from pictures, tables, statistics, and models. Some Indian silk fabrics, which are particularly expensive and exclusively promoted by the United States, have not been displayed either. Mr. P.K. Panikkar, the head of the exhibition delegation, said that this exhibition mainly displays various commodities that India can export. Other symbolic things, such as pictures and statistics, only indicate that this export trade has great prospects for development.

Mr. Panikkar is also the Director of Exhibition Affairs of the Indian Central Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Ten years ago, when India regained its independence, a special agency for industrial and commercial exhibition affairs was established in the ministry. More than 150 people work there. After the Second World War, countries advocated exhibitions to promote international trade, and the Indian government also adopted this approach. The purpose is to maintain and promote international trade and external economic relations. In recent years, the Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry has organized commodity exhibitions in more than eighty countries. Indian commodity exhibitions have been held in the Soviet Union, the United States, Egypt, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Thailand, Japan, Finland, Italy, Malaysia, Yugoslavia, Indonesia, Czechoslovakia, Canada, and Australia. They have also been held in several countries in East and West Africa.

Last year, there was a plan to hold an Indian cultural and handicraft exhibition in Beijing. This plan was expanded in May this year and changed to the current industrial and commercial exhibition. Mr. Panikkar said, "This kind of industrial and commercial exhibition is completely organized by the government in the Soviet Union, and completely organized by private enterprises in the United Kingdom and the United States, but in India, it must be inclusive." The Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry solicited exhibits from state-owned enterprises and private companies on a voluntary basis. The preparation period started in June this year and lasted for almost two months.

This exhibition in the western suburbs of Beijing will last for three weeks and cover an area of 11,000 square meters. The exhibition is divided into four major sections. Downstairs are the handicrafts, textile industry, heavy industry, and large-scale industry sections. Upstairs are light industrial products. The display of handicrafts includes enamelware, lacquerware, bronzeware, silverware, ivory carvings, horn carvings, embroidery, and weaving, representing more than 70% of the varieties of handicrafts in India. The display of textile products is divided into four groups: cotton, wool, silk, and nylon. Each group has both hand-woven and machine-woven products. There are about 600 textile companies in India, of which more than 40 participated in this exhibition.

The third section is heavy industry and large-scale industry. Here are displayed various machine parts that can be exported, and it also represents an overview of India's economic development. We can see models of hydroelectric power stations, locomotives, automatic telephone stations, as well as automobiles, internal combustion engines, various electrical appliances, and various machine parts. Light industry other than the textile industry constitutes the fourth section. There are even more varieties displayed here. The most noteworthy are fertilizers, agricultural machinery, bicycles, scientific instruments, various furniture, various carpets, hospital equipment, surgical instruments, and various chemical and pharmaceutical products. The products displayed in this section only represent 20-30% of what can be exported.

India's foreign trade is expanding year by year. However, the increase in exports is not as large as the increase in imports, so the total value of imports last year exceeded the total value of exports by more than 2 billion rupees (each rupee is about half a yuan in Chinese currency). Trade between India and socialist countries is also developing. Agreements have long been signed with China and the Soviet Union. Recently, trade agreements have also been reached with Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Poland, and Yugoslavia. Most of the Indian goods exported to socialist countries are mineral sands, woolen fabrics, cotton cloth, leather shoes, and jute products. Most of the imports from socialist countries are steel, machinery, and cement.

The development of international trade, especially the development of trade between socialist and capitalist countries, has become an important category of international cooperation and a good foundation for peace and friendship. Economically, this is beneficial to countries with two different social systems. Moreover, India has had these obvious tendencies from the first to the second five-year plan: the plan for state-owned enterprises has been strengthened, dispersed heavy industries have been given importance, and handicrafts and public utilities are gradually expanding. India can sign long-term trade agreements with socialist countries, which will help stabilize the domestic economic situation.

As early as the Middle Ages, there was maritime trade between China and India. During the Tang Dynasty, many Arabs and Indians resided in Guangzhou. During the Song and Ming dynasties, no fewer than dozens of Chinese merchants lived on the southwest coast of India. In the early fifteenth century, Zheng He's ships docked there several times. Now, we can still see the Jiangnan-style roofs, fishing nets, and boats for transporting rice straw. However, after the Yongle period, China stopped maritime trade, and the arrival of Western European merchants in India in the seventeenth century further hindered the development of Sino-Indian relations.

In recent years, direct trade between China and India has not only been restored but is also gradually expanding. We can import mica, tobacco, hemp rope, electric fans, woolen fabrics, and various chemical and pharmaceutical products from India. They can import caustic soda, newsprint, and grain from our country. India will increase agricultural production, but it will still need to import rice and wheat as grain reserves.

Seeing the exhibits in each section of the exhibition, we gained a deep impression of India's rich resources, diverse culture, and sophisticated technology. What is particularly gratifying is that such an exhibition will surely promote economic cooperation and cultural exchange between China and India, and will be conducive to maintaining world peace.

### 从印度展览会谈中印贸易

　　从印度展览会谈中印贸易
　　中印友好协会副会长　陈翰笙
    印度展览会今天在北京开幕，对促进中印贸易和中印友好将有重大贡献。过去，1952年春在孟买和1955年冬在新德里，我国曾参加了那里的商品展览。现在我们祝贺印度展览会第一次在中国开幕。
    十九世纪中叶英帝国主义者创立了大西洋至印度洋的航线。英轮船公司开始在印度内地建设一个周密的铁道网。同时印度的农作物在英国的重税下逐渐商品化而供应英国所需要的工业原料。从此现代式商业就在印度出现了。印度现代工业的基础是纺织业，是在第一次世界大战期间欧亚交通阻隔的状况下独自发展起来的。加尔各答和孟买已是两个大规模的现代工业区。前者有百余家制麻和麻织品工厂。后者的轻工业更为发达，仅棉织工厂就有二百以上。此外还有十余个城市拥有现代化的工业。
    印度独立以来，印度政府和人民为了发展民族经济，作了很大的努力。经过第一个五年计划，印度的农业和工业生产都提高了。现在，印度正在开始实行以发展重工业为主的第二个五年计划。
    可是，这次展览会并非要表示印度现代工业发展的全部。例如制酸工业是一种基本工业，这种出品就未曾陈列。两个五年计划中的建设规模，只能从图片、表格、统计、模型去推知。价格特别昂贵、专为推销美国的一些印度丝织品，也没有摆放出来。展览会代表团团长皮·开·潘尼克说，这次展览会主要是陈列印度能输出的各种商品。其它象征的东西，如图片、统计之类只是表示这种输出贸易大有发展前途。
    潘尼克团长也是印度中央工商部展览事务的主任。十年前印度恢复独立，即在该部建立有关工商展览事务的专门机构。在那里工作的达一百五十余人。第二次世界大战后，各国多提倡展览会以促进国际贸易，印度政府也采用了这个办法。其目的是要维持和推广国际贸易和对外经济关系。近几年来印度工商部已组织了在八十余个国家里举办的商品展览会。在苏联、美国、埃及、巴西、英国、泰国、日本、芬兰、意大利、马来亚、南斯拉夫、印度尼西亚、捷克斯洛伐克、加拿大、澳大利亚等国，都曾有印度商品展览会。在东非和西非几个国家也曾举办过。
    去年原有一个在北京举办印度文化和手工业展览会的计划。这个计划今年5月被扩大而改为目前的工商展览会。潘尼克团长说，“这种工商展览会在苏联完全是由政府组织的，在英美完全是由私人企业组织的，但在印度必须兼容并蓄。”印度工商部向国营企业和私家公司，在自愿参加的条件下，征集了展览会陈列品。今年6月起，筹备时期几达两个月。
    这次在北京西郊的展览将以三周为期，所占面积有一万一千平方公尺。展览会分四大部门。楼下是手工业、纺织工业、重工业和大型工业三部门。楼上是轻工业出品。手工业出品的陈列包括珐琅器、漆器、铜器、银器、牙雕、角雕、刺绣、编织等，代表了印度全国手工业品种十分之七以上。纺织工业品的陈列又分棉、毛、丝、尼龙四组。每组都有手织和机织两种出品。印度约有六百家纺织公司，其中四十余家参加了这次展览会。
    第三部门是重工业和大型工业。这里陈列着可以输出的各种机件，同时也表示印度经济发展的一个梗概。我们可以看到水电站、火车头、自动电话站等模型，和汽车、内燃机、各种电气器械和各种机件。纺织业以外的轻工业构成第四部门。这里所陈列的品种更多了。其中最可注意的是肥料、农耕机、自行车、科学仪器、各种家具、各种地毯、医院设备、外科用具，以及各种化学和药学出品。这一部门所陈列的出品仅代表可以输出的十分之二三。
    印度对外贸易正在逐年扩大。但输出额不及进口额增加得那样多，故去年进口总值超过输出总值二十余亿卢比（每个卢比约合我人民币半元）。印度与社会主义国家间贸易也正在发展。和中、苏两国早就订有协定。最近又和捷、罗、匈、波、南等国达成贸易协议。输出到社会主义国家的印度货品大多为矿砂、呢绒、棉布、皮鞋，以及麻制品。从社会主义国家进口的大多为钢材、机器和水泥。
    国际贸易的发展，特别是社会主义国家和资本主义国家间贸易的发展，已成为国际合作的重要范畴，和平友好的良好基础。在经济上这对两种不同社会制度的国家彼此都有利益。何况印度从第一个到第二个五年计划已有这些明显的倾向：国营企业的计划增强，分散的重工业受到重视，手工业和公用事业正在逐渐扩充。印度与社会主义各国可以订立长期贸易协定，有助于稳定国内经济局势。
    早在中古时代中印两国就有海上贸易。唐代阿拉伯人和印度人居留广州的很多。宋明两代中国商家侨居印度西南海岸的也不下数十人。十五世纪初年，郑和的船只曾数次停泊在那里。现在那里还可以看到我国江南式的屋脊、鱼网和运输稻柴的船。但永乐以后中国停止海上贸易，而十七世纪西欧商人到了印度更阻碍了中印间关系的发展。
    最近几年来，中印间直接贸易不仅已经恢复，且正在逐渐扩增。我们可以从印度输入云母、烟草、麻绳、电扇、毛织品和各种化学工业及药学工业的出品。他们可以从我国输入苛性钠、印报纸和粮食等等。印度将提高农业生产，但仍要进口大米和小麦作为储粮。
    我们在展览会看到各部门的陈列品，对印度的资源丰富、文化多彩、技术精良得到一个深刻的印象。尤其使人高兴的是，这样一个展览会必将促进中印两国间经济合作和文化交流，有利于维护世界和平。
