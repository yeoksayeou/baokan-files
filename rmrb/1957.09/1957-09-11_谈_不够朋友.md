　　Talking About "Not Being a Good Friend"
　　Qiu Youyuan
    At a meeting exposing and criticizing the reactionary words and deeds of a rightist, a comrade who used to be close to this rightist and had been influenced by him, stood up to expose his anti-Party words and deeds. After the meeting, this rightist scolded the comrade who exposed him for being "disloyal to friends" and "not being a good friend." What does it mean to be a "good friend"? According to his meaning, it should be to protect and cover up his anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds. What an absurd and insidious argument!
    The word "friend," in people's minds, is always associated with noble virtues such as "恪守信用 (ke shou xin yong - upholding faith)," "忠诚相助 (zhong cheng xiang zhu - assisting with loyalty)," "患难同济 (huan nan tong ji - sharing weal and woe)," and "生死与共 (sheng si yu gong - sharing life and death)." However, a principle issue must be clarified here: For whom and for what should we "uphold faith," "assist with loyalty," "share weal and woe," and "share life and death"? That is to say, the friendship we advocate and respect must be based on a high degree of principle. That is, our friendship is not built on protecting the interests of individuals or a few; but on defending the Party and safeguarding socialism. Our loyalty does not stem from narrow personal feelings; but from the lofty class feelings and great interests of the working class. Lenin said: "We recognize the obligations among comrades, recognize the obligation to help all comrades, recognize the obligation to listen patiently to the opinions of comrades, but for us, the obligations among comrades arise from the obligations of the Russian and worldwide Social Democrats (referring to the revolutionary party of the working class), and cannot be reversed."
    Today's bourgeois rightists are "anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist bourgeois reactionaries," "such people not only have words, but also actions, they are guilty." Their anti-communist and anti-socialist activities are endangering the survival of our country and nation. In order to defend the Party and safeguard socialism, we should resolutely break all private friendships and overcome all sentimentalism towards these "friends" who have long since "parted ways" with us, and rise up to expose them and defeat them. For rightists, it is not a question of friends or not, but a question of "大义灭亲 (da yi mie qin - placing righteousness before family)."
    Let us never be fooled by the beautiful word "friend"! Comrades, we need to be vigilant! (Excerpt from the "China People's University Weekly")

### 谈“不够朋友”

　　谈“不够朋友”
　　丘猷远
    在一次揭发和批判右派分子反动言行的大会上，一位素与这个右派分子要好、并受过他影响的同志，起来揭发了他的反党言行。会后，这个右派分子骂揭露他的同志是“对朋友不忠实”、“不够朋友”。怎样才算“够朋友”呢？按照他的意思就应该替他的反共反社会主义言行庇护、掩饰。这是多么荒谬和阴险的论调啊！
    “朋友”这两个字，在人们心目中，总是把它喻之“恪守信用”、“忠诚相助”、“患难同济”、“生死与共”等崇高美德联系在一起的。但是这里必须搞清楚一个原则问题：我们究竟是为谁，为什么事情去“恪守信用”、“忠诚相助”、“患难同济”、“生死与共”呢？这就是说，我们提倡和尊重的友谊，必须是以高度原则性为前提的。那就是，我们的友谊不是建立在保护个人或少数人利益的基础上；而是建立在捍卫党、保卫社会主义的基础上的。我们的忠诚，不是从狭小的私人的感情出发；而是出自工人阶级的崇高阶级感情和伟大的利益。列宁说过：“我们承认同志间的义务，承认有援助一切同志的义务，承认有耐心听取同志们意见的义务，但对我们来说，同志间的义务是从俄国的和全世界社会民主党（指工人阶级的革命政党）的义务产生出来的，不能把它颠倒过来”。
    今天的资产阶级右派分子，是“反共反人民反社会主义的资产阶级反动派”，“这种人不但有言论，而且有行动，他们是有罪的”。他们所进行的反共反社会主义活动，是危害着我们国家和民族的存亡的。为了捍卫党、保卫社会主义，对这种早已与我们“分道扬镳”的“朋友”，我们应该坚决打破一切私交情面，克服各种温情主义，起来揭露他们，打夸他们。对右派分子来说，不是朋友不朋友的问题，而是“大义灭亲”的问题。
    我们决不要在“朋友”这一美丽的词句上上当！同志们，我们需要警惕啊！（摘自中国人民大学周报）
