This is an example of peaceful coexistence between countries."
    He said that in recent years, the friendship between China and India, which had been interrupted for a period of time, has been restored, and now both countries are building their own strong countries and improving the living standards of the people. "We must work hard for peaceful coexistence, world peace, and the liberation of oppressed people."

He said: "Since the people of our two countries built their respective new countries, we have both prosperously embarked on the road of peaceful construction, playing an active role in the great cause of safeguarding Asian and world peace. At the same time, our traditional friendly relations have gained new and great development on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by China and India. In this regard, the leaders of our two governments have made outstanding contributions through mutual visits in recent years, and have been unanimously cheered by the people of the two countries. This is also of extremely important significance for the unity of the people of Asian and African countries and for world peace."
    Vice Chairman Zhu De said: "We have no doubt that Your Excellency's visit to our country will further promote the development of friendly relations between China and India."
    After the speeches by the leaders of the two countries, as the Indian Vice President went around the airport to meet the welcoming crowds, shouts of "Long live Sino-Indian friendship" and "Long live Asian and world peace" rose and echoed in the sky.
