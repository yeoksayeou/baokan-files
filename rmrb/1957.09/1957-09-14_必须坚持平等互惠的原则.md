Observer's Commentary:

　　The Principle of Equality and Mutual Benefit Must Be Upheld
    At the Sino-US ambassadorial talks on September 12th, the Chinese side suggested that, on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, each country should permit journalists from the other to conduct news interviews in their respective countries in order to promote mutual understanding between the peoples of China and the United States. However, the US side insisted on the absurd position expressed in the US State Department's press release of August 22nd, declaring that it "cannot consider" China's suggestion. This shows that the US government has no intention of considering the legitimate desire of the peoples of China and the United States to understand each other, and is determined to continue to obstruct the realization of this desire.
    Any honest person will admit that the Chinese side's suggestion is completely fair and reasonable. It not only fully conforms to internationally recognized practices, but also has positive significance for promoting mutual understanding between the peoples of China and the United States. As early as September 22, 1956, the Chinese side proposed that China and the United States carry out cultural exchanges and people-to-people contacts, but the US side refused outright. Even under these circumstances, the Chinese government still proactively approved some American journalists to come to our country for interviews in December 1956. However, the US government has obstructed this in many ways. Recently, under the pressure of public opinion, although the US government nominally allows American journalists to come to China for interviews, it has openly prescribed the task of interfering in our internal affairs for American journalists, while at the same time refusing to grant Chinese journalists reciprocal visas. The US government clearly knows that China will not act according to the orders of the US State Department. In reality, it is deliberately playing this trick to deceive public opinion, trying to shift the responsibility for obstructing exchanges between the peoples of China and the United States onto China. This trick of the US government is not clever, and as some American newspapers have said, it is counterproductive.
    Equality and mutual benefit are the most basic principles in international exchanges. The US government cannot give any reason for opposing this principle. The US State Department's press release of August 22nd stated: "Needless to say, the United States will not give reciprocal visas to Chinese citizens holding passports issued by the Chinese Communist regime." Here, the words "needless to say" are used as its "reason." US Secretary of State Dulles was also very afraid to answer this question at several press conferences. On August 27th, finding himself at the end of his rope, he simply shouted that he "cannot recognize the Chinese Communist side's right to make a reciprocal request." Here, the words "not recognize" are used as its "reason." What we see from the US government is a completely typical unreasonable imperialist face. Mr. Dulles is clearly still dreaming. He thinks that the relationship between the United States and China should be like the old days before the founding of New China, as if the United States only needs to put on a stinking face to replace all the principles of international law. But no matter how beautiful the dream is, it will eventually be shattered. We want to tell the likes of Dulles that they are wrong, that they must learn how to treat others on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and the sooner they learn it, the better for them, otherwise, their situation will become more and more unpleasant.
    In order to ease the condemnation of public opinion, the US government claimed that although it opposes the principle of equality and mutual benefit, it seems that it can still "consider according to law" Chinese journalists who request to visit the United States. However, this is another clumsy deception! According to what law exactly? The US government did not explain. However, the statement issued by the US delegation to the Sino-US ambassadorial talks on September 12th even mentioned the so-called "immigration law," confusing journalist interviews with "immigration," saying that this law would affect Chinese journalists' visits to the United States. Prior to this, Dulles also mentioned the so-called "fingerprinting" "law" at a press conference. The mention of these "laws" by the likes of Dulles is clearly not accidental. This is their attempt, while opposing the principle of equality and mutual benefit, to set up a second "defense line" in order to obstruct normal exchanges and mutual understanding between the peoples of China and the United States in every possible way.
    We believe that carrying out exchanges between journalists from China and the United States should be a relatively easy-to-solve specific measure to improve Sino-US relations at present. The peoples of China and the United States have long had this desire. International public opinion is also concerned and supports doing so. Now, the Chinese side has put forward reasonable and feasible suggestions, and the question is entirely whether the United States has sincerity. If it has sincerity, then it must first recognize the principle of equality and mutual benefit; otherwise, no matter what tricks it plays, it cannot escape the responsibility for obstructing normal exchanges between the peoples of China and the United States.

### 必须坚持平等互惠的原则

　　必须坚持平等互惠的原则
    在9月12日中美两国大使会议上，中国方面建议：在平等互惠的基础上，准许对方新闻记者前来各自的国家，进行新闻采访，以促进中美两国人民之间的互相了解。但是，美国方面却坚持美国国务院在8月22日的新闻公报中所表示的荒谬立场，宣称“不能考虑”中国的建议。这表明，美国政府根本无意考虑中美两国人民要求互相了解的正当愿望，而决心继续阻挠这种愿望的实现。
    任何一个正直的人都会承认，中国方面的建议是完全公平合理的。它不仅完全符合国际公认的惯例，而且对于促进中美两国人民之间的相互了解具有积极的意义。早在1956年9月22日，中国方面就提出过中美两国开展文化交流和人民往来的建议，可是美国方面竟一口拒绝了。即使在这种情况下，中国政府还是在1956年12月间主动地批准了一些美国记者前来我国采访。但是，美国政府却多方面加以阻挠。最近美国政府在舆论的压力下，虽然名义上允许美国记者来中国采访，可是它竟公然给美国记者规定了干涉我国内政的任务，同时它又拒绝给予中国记者以互惠签证。美国政府明明知道，中国是不会按照美国国务院的命令办事的。实际上它是故意要玩弄这种手法来欺骗舆论，想把阻挠中美两国人民来往的责任推到中国身上来。美国政府的这个手法是并不高明的，正同美国一些报刊所说，它是弄巧成拙了。
    平等互惠，这是国际交往中的最起码的原则。美国政府要想反对这个原则，是讲不出丝毫道理来的。美国国务院8月22日的新闻公报中写道：“不用说，美国不会给持有中国共产党政权发给的护照的中国人以互惠的签证。”这儿竟用“不用说”三个字作了它的“理由”。美国国务卿杜勒斯在几次记者招待会上也非常害怕回答这个问题。8月27日，他在理屈词穷之余，索性叫喊“不能承认中国共产党方面有权提出互惠的要求”。这儿竟用“不承认”三个字作了它的“理由”。我们从美国政府那里看到的，完全是一副典型的蛮不讲理的帝国主义面孔。杜勒斯先生显然还在作梦。他以为，美国和中国的关系，似乎应该是新中国成立以前的老样子，似乎美国只要摆出一付臭架子，就可以代替全部国际法的原则了。可是梦想不论怎样美妙，毕竟是要破灭的。我们要告诉杜勒斯之流，他们错了，他们必须学会如何以平等互惠的原则来对待别人，而且愈学会得早些对他们愈好，否则，他们的处境将愈来愈不美妙。
    为了缓和舆论的谴责，美国政府宣称，它虽然反对平等互惠的原则，但是似乎还可以对于要求访美的中国记者“根据法律加以考虑”。然而，这又是一个拙劣的骗局！究竟根据什么法律呢？美国政府没有说明。但是，参加中美大使会议的美国代表团9月12日发表的声明中，竟然提到所谓“移民法”，把记者采访和“移民”混为一谈，说什么这个法律将影响中国记者访美。在这以前，杜勒斯在一次记者招待会上也提到所谓“按指印”的“法律”。杜勒斯之流提到这些“法律”，显然不是偶然的。这是他们在反对平等互惠原则的同时，还要设置第二道“防线”，以便百般阻挠中美两国人民的正常来往和互相了解。
    我们认为，开展中美两国新闻记者的来往，应该是目前改善中美关系方面比较容易解决的一项具体措施。中美两国人民早就有这种愿望。国际舆论也关心和赞成这样做。现在，中国方面已经提出了合理和切实可行的建议，问题完全在于美国究竟有没有诚意。如果有诚意，那么它就必须首先承认平等互惠的原则；否则，不论再玩弄任何花样，也不能逃脱它阻挠中美两国人民正常来往的责任。
