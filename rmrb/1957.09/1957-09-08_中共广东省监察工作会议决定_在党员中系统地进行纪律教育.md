Special Dispatch from Xinhua News Agency: The grassroots organizations of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Guangdong Province, in conjunction with the new situations arising from the ongoing anti-Rightist struggle and socialist education movement across the province, will systematically launch a Party discipline education movement among all Party members. The Third Guangdong Provincial Disciplinary Inspection Work Conference, which concluded on the 7th, has decided that this Party discipline education movement will begin in mid-September and end before the end of this year.

The provincial disciplinary inspection work conference, which lasted ten days, pointed out that this systematic Party discipline education is the largest-scale disciplinary education movement conducted by Guangdong's Party organizations among Party members during the socialist revolution. The conference believes that in order to ensure new and greater victories for the Party's leadership in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, Party organizations at all levels in Guangdong must further consolidate and purify the Party ranks in conjunction with the current actual struggles, and strengthen the Party's organization and discipline on the basis of generally improving the socialist and communist consciousness of Party members. Therefore, in light of the new situations that have emerged in the current political and ideological class struggle in Party organizations across the province, conducting a systematic Party discipline education for Party members in every Party branch is of extremely urgent and important significance.

After analyzing the current situation of Party organizations in Guangdong Province, the conference believes that in the current fierce class struggle, some class enemies who have infiltrated the Party have exposed their true anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist colors. Some degenerates who have been deeply corrupted by the bourgeoisie and have lost their revolutionary will betray the Party at the critical moment of the revolution. Some wavering Party members whose ideology has not been well reformed also fail to stand firm in the face of the great storm of this revolutionary struggle, displaying various erroneous thoughts and behaviors that violate the Party's principles and discipline.

The provincial disciplinary inspection work conference strictly criticized various erroneous statements by some Party members who attempted to weaken and deny the Party's discipline; at the same time, it pointed out that it is necessary to oppose the simple and crude practice of hastily punishing Party members without patiently conducting political and ideological education on Party discipline.

The provincial disciplinary inspection work conference emphasized that through this Party discipline education, Party members must generally be able to consciously abide by the Party's discipline, enhance Party members' political and ideological training, and enable Party members to more actively and effectively carry out resolute struggle against all bourgeois ideas and behaviors that undermine Party discipline and state law. In this way, Guangdong's Party organizations will become a Party force with stricter discipline in thought and organization in the struggle against the bourgeois Rightists.

    中共广东省监察工作会议决定
    在党员中系统地进行纪律教育
    本报特约新华社专稿　中共广东省的基层组织结合全省当前反右派斗争和社会主义教育运动开展的新情况，即将在全体党员中系统地展开党的纪律教育运动。七日结束的中共广东省第三次监察工作会议已经决定，这次党纪教育运动将在9月中旬开始，至今年年底以前结束。
    历时十天的全省监察工作会议指出，这次系统的党纪教育是广东党组织在社会主义革命中对党员进行的一次规模最大的纪律教育运动。会议认为，为了保证党领导社会主义革命和社会主义建设获得新的更伟大的胜利，广东各级党组织必须结合当前的实际斗争进一步巩固与纯洁党的队伍，在普遍提高党员的社会主义共产主义觉悟的基础上加强党的组织性、纪律性。因此，针对全省各地党组织在当前政治上思想上这一阶级斗争中出现的新情况，在党的每个支部对党员系统地进行一次党纪教育就具有极其迫切的重要意义。
    会议分析了广东省的党组织目前的情况后，认为在当前激烈的阶级斗争中，一些混入党内的阶级敌对分子就暴露出他们的反党反人民反社会主义的真面目。一些深受资产阶级腐蚀、丧失革命意志的蜕化分子，在革命的紧要关头就背叛党。一些不坚定的、思想没有很好改造的党员，在这场革命斗争的大风浪中也站不稳立场，表现出各种违反党的原则和纪律的错误思想行为。
    省监察工作会议严格批判了有些党员企图削弱和否认党的纪律的各种错误言论；同时又指出必须反对不愿耐心进行党纪方面的政治思想教育工作，就草率地大批处分党员的简单粗暴的做法。
    省监察工作会议强调指出，通过这次党纪教育必须使党员普遍能自觉地遵守党的纪律，增强党员的政治思想锻炼，使党员更积极有效地对党内外一切资产阶级思想和破坏党纪国法的行为进行坚决的斗争。这样，便使广东的党组织在和资产阶级右派斗争中成为思想上和组织上具有更严格纪律的党的队伍。
