Newspaper Article Abstract:

　　Currently, when carrying out socialist debate, we cannot put the unified purchase and sale and the superiority of cooperation, the improvement of farmers' lives, and the relationship between workers and peasants on an equal footing and organize debates together. These four aspects of the problem all need to be discussed, and there are connections between them, but we should distinguish between the urgent and the less urgent. Currently, we should focus on discussing the unified purchase and sale problem, take the unified purchase and sale problem as the focus, and let farmers concentrate on discussion, fully express their views, and have great debates to eliminate individualism, capitalism, and departmentalism regarding the unified purchase and sale problem. At present, grain is a very important issue for the country, and the peasants have a great resistance to this issue, which is the focus of the struggle between socialism and capitalism in rural areas. On this issue, if socialist ideology achieves a decisive victory and the consciousness of the peasants is raised, then this year's autumn harvest distribution and grain purchase tasks can be smoother than in the past, and a new look can emerge, making agricultural cooperatives more consolidated.

### 目前农村应集中讨论统购统销问题

专栏：报刊论文摘要

　　目前农村应集中讨论统购统销问题
    在开展社会主义辩论的时候，不能把统购统销和合作化有没有优越性、农民生活有没有提高以及工农关系问题平列起来，一起组织辩论。这四个方面的问题都是要讨论的，它们之间也是有联系的，但是应分清缓急，目前要集中讨论统购统销问题，把统购统销问题作为重点，让农民集中讨论，大鸣大辩大争，消除对统购统销问题的个人主义、资本主义和本位主义思想。当前粮食是国家的一个十分重要的问题，而农民在这个问题上抵抗情绪很大，是农村社会主义与资本主义斗争的焦点。在这个问题上，如果社会主义思想取得了决定性的胜利，农民觉悟提高，那么，今年秋收分配和征购粮任务都能比过去顺利，就能出现一番新面貌，使农业合作社更加巩固。 （摘自8月31日辽宁日报社论：“为什么要展开统购统销的大辩论”）
