　　Xinhua News Agency, 6th. Beijing's grain, commerce, banking and service industries, and more than forty company-level units have begun the rectification campaign.

　　These days, these units hold daily symposiums and group meetings, and employees are actively offering opinions. The more than 730 opinions recently put forward by employees of the Textile Products Company included more than 260 on improving business management. They criticized leading cadres for not conducting investigations and research. Last spring, the amount of cotton cloth released in Beijing had already reached the target, but in the summer the supply range was blindly broadened, causing difficulties in the supply of cotton cloth after the autumn. They asked the company leaders to strengthen the planning of business and improve the cotton cloth supply work in the autumn and winter of this year. Employees of the Food Company criticized the waste in the company, pointing out that during the peak season of egg products in July and August last year, because egg product storage was not done in time, there was an avoidable loss. They asked the company to improve the storage of egg products this year. In Wangfujing Department Store, where the rectification campaign started earlier, employees put forward more than 3,000 opinions.

　　The rectification campaign in Beijing's financial and trade departments is currently mainly carried out in bureaus, companies, and large stores. The Party committees and responsible cadres of the units that have already started the rectification campaign have made many mobilization reports to employees, mobilizing everyone to offer opinions. Many units have set up suggestion boxes and established reception rooms. Some leading cadres have also conducted individual visits to listen to employees' criticisms.

　　At the same time as the rectification campaign, each unit has sorted out and studied the opinions put forward by the masses in accordance with the spirit of rectifying and correcting simultaneously, and assigned special personnel to be responsible for improving what can be changed at present.

    北京市财贸系统开始整风
    新华社6日讯　北京市的粮食、商业、银行和服务性行业等四十多个公司级单位开始整风。
    这几天，这些单位每天举行座谈会和小组会，职工们提意见十分踊跃。纺织品公司的职工最近提出的七百三十多条意见，有二百六十多条是关于企业改进经营管理的。他们批评领导干部不调查研究，去年春天北京市棉布的投放量已经达到了指标，却在夏季里又盲目放宽供应幅度，造成秋后棉布供应困难。他们要求公司领导方面加强业务的计划性，改进今年秋、冬季的棉布供应工作。食品公司的职工批评公司中存在着浪费现象，指出去年7、8月蛋品旺季中，因为没有及时做好蛋品储存工作，致使受了不应有的损失，他们要求公司改进今年蛋品的储存工作。整风开始较早的王府井百货商店，职工们提出的意见有三千多条。
    北京市财政、贸易部门的整风目前主要是在局、公司、大商店等单位进行，已经开始整风的各单位的党委和企业负责干部，都向职工作了多次的动员报告，发动大家提意见。不少单位设置了意见箱，成立了接待室，有些领导干部还进行个别访问，听取职工们的批评。
    在整风的同时，各单位根据边整边改的精神，对群众提出的意见进行了整理研究，对目前能改的，指定专人负责着手改进。
