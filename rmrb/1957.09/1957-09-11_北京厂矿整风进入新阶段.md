Xinhua News Agency, September 10th: The rectification movement in forty state-owned factories and mines in the capital, after about twenty days of vigorous airing of views, has now either fully entered, or is about to fully enter, a new stage focused on improving work.

To date, nearly 120,000 employees in these forty factories and mines have put forward more than 500,000 opinions through various forms such as big-character posters, group meetings, symposiums, and letters and visits from the masses. According to the analysis of the competent departments, the opinions from all aspects inside and outside the enterprises have basically been expressed.

The rectification movement in these forty state-owned factories and mines began in late August. In the previous three months, under the leadership of the Party organizations and veteran workers, the employees of each factory and mine had listened to and studied reports on the struggle against bourgeois rightists, and the leadership of each factory and mine had more thoroughly dealt with the problems left over from the "three-anti" and "suppress-counterrevolutionaries" movements within the factories and mines, abolished some unreasonable treatments for leading cadres, and organized leading cadres to participate in labor, established a system of regularly going deep into workshops or holding worker symposiums, and solved some problems in production and employee welfare that could be solved at that time. On the basis of such work, when the Party committees of each factory and mine announced the comprehensive commencement of the rectification movement, after the mobilization of the Party organizations and the impetus of activists, under the topic of "How to run socialist enterprises well," the broad masses of employees, especially the broad masses of workers, began to vigorously air their views, generally entering a climax in a week to ten days.

During the climax, many factories and mines had a constant flow of people posting and reading big-character posters around the clock. Leading cadres stayed up all night to understand the situation, analyze problems, and talk to every Party member and cadre who might have resistance to the vigorous airing of views, while trying their best to solve some problems that could be solved from their busy schedules, and boldly mobilized the masses of employees to vigorously air their views. The canteen of the Maliandao Factory of the Wangzifen Field of the Beijing Automobile Transportation Company had poor hygiene, long waiting times for meals, and no seats. After the workers criticized it, the field leadership immediately increased the number of meal selling windows, added tables and chairs, and established a disinfection system, shortening the meal buying time from forty minutes to ten minutes. This greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of employees to put forward opinions.

The biggest characteristic of these forty state-owned factories and mines in the rectification movement is that they fully promoted democracy and had a high degree of concentration. While vigorously airing their views, the workers of each factory and mine adhered to the normal production order, and completely achieved the goal of not hindering production with rectification. In August, the total output value of state-owned industry in the city exceeded the production plan by 7.7%, an increase of 12.5% compared with the total output value in the same period last year, and there were no major personal or production accidents.

In this rectification movement, the democratic life within the working class was unprecedentedly active, and criticism of superiors by subordinates has been regarded as a normal phenomenon. Many factory-level leading cadres have been named and criticized by employees at meetings or in big-character posters. When the leading cadres sincerely accepted the correct opinions of the workers and resolutely corrected them, the workers respected and loved them even more, and the opinions that were originally on their minds were completely eliminated. Many factory leading cadres have realized from the practice of this rectification movement the great significance of promoting this kind of socialist democracy within factories and mines for resolving the internal contradictions of the working class. Li Ximing, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Shijingshan Power Plant of the Communist Party of China, said at a recent employee representative meeting that within the enterprise, big-character posters are one of the effective ways to urge leaders to improve their work. This factory plans to fix the method of posting big-character posters in a more appropriate form.

The vast majority of the 500,000 opinions put forward by the employees of these factories and mines are based on improving production management and improving the work style of cadres. According to preliminary analysis by the competent departments, among these opinions, about 66% are suggestions for improving production management and criticisms of the work style of cadres, about 20% are opinions or problems related to employee welfare, wages, and bonuses, and the rest are mutual criticisms among employees, opinions on higher-level Party and government leaders and other units outside the factory, and some different views of a few employees on national life issues. Some issues have begun to spark debate.

According to the spirit of rectifying while correcting, the Party committees of each factory and mine are vigorously dealing with the opinions that can be handled currently. As of the 5th, according to statistics from thirty-one factories and mines, nearly three thousand problems formed by more than one hundred thousand opinions have been solved. Other types of opinions are being actively dealt with.

　　北京厂矿整风进入新阶段
    据新华社10日讯　首都四十个国营厂矿的整风运动，经过大约二十天的大鸣大放之后，现在已经或即将全部进入着重改进工作的新阶段。
    到今天为止，这四十个厂矿的近十二万职工，通过大字报、小组会、座谈会和群众来信来访等多种形式，已提出了五十万条以上的意见。据主管部门分析，企业内外各方面的意见，基本上已经发表出来了。
    这四十个国营厂矿的整风运动，是从8月下旬开始的。在这以前的三个月内，各厂矿的职工在党组织和老工人的带领下，曾分别听取和学习了反对资产阶级右派的斗争的报告，各厂矿的领导上较彻底地处理了厂矿内三反、肃反中遗留的问题，取消了对领导干部的一些不合理的待遇，领导干部还有组织地参加劳动，建立了定期深入车间或召开工人座谈会的制度，解决了当时可能解决的生产和职工生活福利上的一些问题。在这样的工作基础上，当各厂矿的党委宣布整风运动全面开始后，经过党组织的动员和积极分子的带动，在“如何办好社会主义企业”的题目下，广大职工首先是广大工人就大鸣大放起来，一般在一周到十天的时间内进入了高潮。
    在高潮期间，许多厂矿整天二十四小时都川流不息地流动着贴、看大字报的人群。领导干部们通宵达旦地了解情况，分析问题，找每个可能对大鸣大放产生抵触情绪的党员干部谈话，同时从百忙中竭力解决一些可能解决的问题，放手发动职工群众大鸣大放。北京市汽车运输公司王子坟场马连道厂食堂卫生不好，买饭时间长，吃饭没座位。工人提出批评后，场的领导上立即增加了卖饭窗口，添设桌凳，建立消毒制度，买饭时间从四十分钟缩短到十分钟。大大鼓舞了职工提意见的积极性。
    这四十个国营厂矿在整风运动中最大的特点，是既充分发扬了民主，又有高度的集中。各厂矿的工人们在大鸣大放的同时，都坚持了正常的生产秩序，完全做到了整风生产两不误。8月份全市国营工业总产值超额了7.7％完成了生产计划，比去年同期的总产值提高12.5％，并且没有发生过重大的人身事故和生产事故。
    在这次整风运动中，工人阶级内部的民主生活空前活跃，下级批评上级已经认为是一种正常的现象。很多厂级领导干部，都在会议或大字报上受到了职工们的点名批评。当领导干部诚恳地接受了工人的正确意见，并且坚决改正之后，工人对他们就更加敬爱，原来放在心上的意见也就完全消除了。许多工厂的领导干部从这次整风运动的实践中，已经认识到在厂矿企业内发扬这种社会主义民主，对于解决工人阶级内部矛盾的重大意义。中共石景山发电厂党委书记李锡铭在最近举行的职工代表大会上说，在企业内部，大字报是督促领导改进工作的有效方式之一。这个厂准备把贴大字报的办法，用更适宜的形式固定下来。
    这批厂矿职工所提出的五十万条意见，绝大多数都是从改进生产管理和改进干部工作作风出发的。据主管部门初步分析，在这些意见中，属于建议改进生产管理和批评干部作风的约占66％，属于职工生活福利、工资奖励方面的意见或问题约占20％，此外就是一些职工之间的互相批评、对上级党政领导、厂外其他单位的意见，以及少数职工对国家生活问题的一些各不相同的看法，有些问题已开始引起了辩论。
    各厂矿的党委根据边整边改的精神，对于当前能够处理的意见，正在大力处理中，截至5日止，据三十一个厂矿统计，已有由十几万条意见并成的近三千个问题得到了解决。其他各类意见正在继续积极处理。
