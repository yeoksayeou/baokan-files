Xinhua News Agency report: The People's Bank of China recently convened a financial work conference for the peak season, which determined that the main tasks for the second half of the year's financial work are: to fully supply funds for the purchase of agricultural and sideline products to ensure the completion of the state's purchasing tasks; to continue to support industrial production and assist commercial departments in doing a good job in commodity supply; to strive to recover overdue agricultural loans and advance purchase deposits, and actively develop urban and rural savings to withdraw currency. In disaster areas, it is also necessary to cooperate with various economic departments to support the purchase of local and special products, issue agricultural production loans, and help farmers restore production and overcome disasters.

During the meeting, Vice Premier of the State Council Li Xiannian attended and gave important instructions. He said that the guiding principle for rural financial work in the future should be: under the continued adherence to the principle of building the country diligently and thriftily, running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and managing households diligently and thriftily, further strengthen the leadership of rural financial work, require going deep into the lower levels to understand the situation, carefully calculate and rationally use funds, in order to promote agricultural cooperatives to improve their operation and management. In the future, the state's agricultural loans will generally no longer increase quotas. The agricultural loans that need to be issued each year will basically be solved by recovering old loans. Therefore, it is necessary to resolutely implement the principle of "borrowing and repaying, repaying when due" to accelerate capital turnover and give full play to the role of existing funds. Only in special circumstances can the central government slightly supplement. The national agricultural loan quota for 1958 will only increase by 150 million yuan. This money should be used with emphasis according to needs, and quotas will generally no longer be allocated in areas without special needs. Next year's agricultural loans will mainly be used for production expenses and basic construction that can be effective within one year, such as small-scale water conservancy projects. Long-term basic construction loans that cannot be repaid within one year should basically be stopped. However, in order to develop some special cash crops in mountainous areas, with the approval of the central government, long-term loans can be appropriately issued under the condition of being both active and prudent. Such loans should be used for special purposes. In 1958, 32 million yuan of long-term loans will be issued for planting walnuts and tea oil. This loan can be interest-free and the term can be extended.

    人民银行召开金融工作会议
    据新华社讯　中国人民银行最近召开的旺季金融工作会议，确定下半年金融工作的主要任务是：充分供应收购农副产品的资金，保证国家收购任务的完成；继续支持工业生产，协助商业部门做好商品供应工作；努力收回到期农贷、预购定金，积极开展城乡储蓄，以回笼货币。在灾区还应配合各经济部门支持土产品特产品的收购，发放农业生产贷款，帮助农民恢复生产度过灾荒。
    会议期间，国务院李先念副总理到会作了重要指示。他说，今后农村金融工作的方针应该是：在继续坚持勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭持家的原则下，进一步加强农村金融工作的领导，要求深入下层了解情况，精打细算，合理使用资金，以促进农业社改进经营管理。今后国家的农业贷款一般不再增加指标，每年所需要发放的农业贷款，基本上依靠收回旧贷来解决，因此必须坚决执行“有借有还，到期归还”的原则，以加速资金周转，充分发挥现有资金的作用，只有在特殊情况下，中央才能略加补助。1958年全国农贷指标只增加一亿五千万元，这笔钱要根据需要重点使用，一般地区无特殊需要的，即不再分配指标。明年的农业贷款主要应用于生产费用和一年以内能够见效的如小型水利等基本建设。一年以内不能归还的长期基本建设贷款，基本上应当停止。但是为了发展山区一些特殊经济作物，经中央批准，在既积极又稳妥的情况下，可以适当发放长期贷款，这种贷款应当专款专用。1958年将发放种植胡桃和茶油的长期贷款三千二百万元，这项贷款可以不计利息，期限可以延长。
