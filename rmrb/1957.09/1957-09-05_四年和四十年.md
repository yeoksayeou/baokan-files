    Four Years and Forty Years
    The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is nearing completion. According to the current progress of the project, the bridge will soon be officially open to traffic.
    The people of our country, especially the people of Wuhan, have dreamed of this bridge for many years and have paid a considerable price. However, before liberation, although the reactionary rulers clamored for nearly forty years, the people did not even see the shadow of the bridge. But this dream quickly became a reality after the birth of New China. In New China, it took less than four years to build this huge and complex bridge, about two years ahead of the original national plan.
    It is incorrect to understand the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge with the concept of a general bridge. This is not a single bridge, but a complex aggregate of many engineering structures. First of all, it includes a double-deck bridge across the Yangtze River, that is, the main bridge of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, which is the main component of the entire bridge project. The upper deck of the bridge is paved with highways, and the lower deck is paved with double-track railways. Secondly, it includes the Hanshui Railway Bridge and the Hanshui Highway Bridge (ie, Jianghan Bridge), which were built in 1954 and 1955 respectively. Furthermore, it also includes ten overpasses of various sizes that cross streets and railway lines, three new large stations, railway and highway connecting lines connecting the bridgeheads and stations, and flood walls to defend against high water levels. The aforementioned construction of the Yangtze River Bridge took less than four years, which refers to such a complex "aggregate". The construction period of the main bridge of the Yangtze River Bridge itself is only a little over two years.
    When the bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Communist Party and the socialist system, they clamored that the Communist Party was an amateur in engineering technology and could not lead engineering construction, especially the construction of large projects; that socialism was not superior to capitalism, and so on. So, may I ask, Mr. Rightists: How do you explain the fact that the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project was completed so quickly?
    As long as we recall and compare the construction history of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge before and after liberation, it is not difficult to expose the fallacies of the rightists.
    People know that there has never been a bridge on the vast Yangtze River, which runs between the south and the north of our country. This is not because there is no need for such a bridge; on the contrary, it is too necessary. There was no bridge simply because people could not build it in old China.
    The construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was proposed long ago. As early as 1911 and 1913, China's famous engineer Zhan Tianyou had initiated the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge twice. In 1913, thirteen graduates from the Department of Bridge Engineering of Peiyang University came to Wuhan with a German professor to measure the bridge site for the first time. However, the warlord rulers at that time were not interested in building this bridge and were unwilling to support them. As a result, the measurement was the end of it, and no one talked about building the bridge for a long time afterwards.
    After that, in 1930 and 1936, the preparatory work for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was carried out twice again. The one in 1930 was when an American bridge expert named Walter suggested that the Kuomintang reactionary government set up an agency to carry out the preparatory work in order to make a fortune in China. At that time, a group of Chinese engineering personnel participated in the preparatory work for the bridge with full enthusiasm, as if the bridge was bound to be built. But what was the result? This American expert spent half a year drilling eight holes in the Yangtze River and two holes in the Hanshui River, and then disappeared without a trace. Why is this happening? It turned out that Walter designed a very expensive bridge in order to make a lot of money, and Chiang Kai-shek originally agreed to do the preparatory work just to put on a show. When he heard that it cost a lot of money, he didn't want to do it. In this way, the bustling bridge preparatory plan became a bubble again. In 1936, the preparatory work was carried out by engineer Mei Yangchun and others from the Qiantang River Bridge Engineering Office. Because of financial difficulties, they adopted the method of soliciting investment to operate the bridge project. In order to stimulate the investment interest of the wealthy gentry at that time, they deliberately set the cost lower and promoted that after the bridge was built, a fee would be charged for each crossing, and the principal and interest could be earned back after many years, but even this could not raise much money. A year later, they came up with an engineering plan, but due to lack of money, they had to put the preparatory work on hold.
    Ten years passed quickly again. In 1946 and 1947, the preparatory work for the Yangtze River Bridge was carried out twice again. The first time was carried out by a group of Chinese engineers, but the result was the same due to financial difficulties and nothing was accomplished. The second time, the American advisory group proposed a so-called "three-hole suspension bridge" construction plan. Because the design itself was unreasonable, the construction team could not be organized, and the Kuomintang reactionary rulers were unwilling to pay, this preparatory work went bankrupt again.
    This is the sad history of the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge before the birth of New China. It can be seen that neither the Northern Warlords, the Kuomintang reactionary rulers, nor the experts and consultants of American imperialism had any interest in building this bridge. What they were most concerned about was making money, fighting civil wars, and putting on a show. Under this circumstance, the Chinese people's long-standing desire to build the Yangtze River Bridge, and the various efforts made by Chinese engineering personnel for this purpose, could only be in vain. Before liberation, there was a folk song on both sides of the Yangtze River: "The Yellow River and the Yangtze River Bridge cannot be cured or repaired." This is indeed a true and accurate judgment of the actual situation in old China.
    After the birth of New China in 1949, in order to cooperate with the great tasks facing the country's construction and realize the long-standing wishes of the people of our country, the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was quickly put on the agenda. In the second year after the founding of the People's Republic of China, that is, in 1950, the then Government Administration Council instructed the Ministry of Railways to carry out the survey and design work for this bridge. In 1953, after preliminary survey, the preparatory work officially began. In February 1954, the Government Administration Council formally approved the decision on building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge.
    After the project started, the Communist Party and the People's Government successively sent a large number of outstanding cadres and seasoned Communist Party members to work in the bridge project. In the beginning, they were basically laymen who did not understand bridge construction, but they had a strong determination to be loyal to the cause of socialism, a working method of being good at relying on the masses and uniting the masses, and were good at constantly learning and improving in their work. These, coupled with the support of the people of the whole country and the help of Soviet experts, finally organized a huge bridge construction team and led the people to fight on the Hanshui and Yangtze Rivers. Over the past few years, they have encountered many difficulties of one kind or another. Originally, since everything had to be explored and advanced from practice, difficulties were of course unavoidable. However, due to the above factors, the difficulties did not overwhelm them, but were always skillfully led by them to overcome them one by one.
    Many examples can be cited to illustrate this situation, let's take the creation process of the new construction method – the "large-scale caisson drilling method", which is of great significance to the Yangtze River Bridge project! Before this method was proposed, for various reasons, the old bridge construction methods in the world could not be adopted on the Yangtze River, and the design of the bridge had been basically at a standstill. Later, the Soviet expert team proposed the above-mentioned new construction method, but at that time, some Chinese engineering personnel were skeptical or even opposed to it. In order to persuade those who were skeptical or even opposed to the new construction method, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau Committee of the Communist Party of China organized a technical debate and proposed that a test should be organized first before it was officially used, so as to educate everyone with facts. During the trial process, the Party Committee carried out a series of political organizational work, educating the workers to cooperate conscientiously with the experts, and the person in charge of the Party Committee personally participated in the trial day and night. After this series of work, the new construction method was successfully tested, and the Chinese engineers who had different opinions were also persuaded. As a result of the successful application of the new construction method in the project, the most complex and important foundation construction problems in the entire project were well solved, which promoted the project to proceed and complete at an unimaginable speed.
    Can the Communist Party really lead engineering technology? Is socialism superior to capitalism? From the facts mentioned above, people can get the correct answer.

    四年和四十年
    武汉长江大桥已经接近全部完工。根据目前工程进行情况看，这座大桥不久就可以正式通车了。
    我国人民，特别是武汉市的人民，为了这座大桥已经梦想了许多年，也曾付出过不少的代价。可是，在解放以前，虽然反动统治者叫嚷了将近四十年，人民却连桥的影子也没有看到。但这个梦想在新中国诞生以后迅速地变成了现实。在新中国，修建这座巨大而复杂的桥，只用了不到四年的时间，比国家原订计划要提前大约两年。
    对于武汉长江大桥，用一般的桥的概念来理解它是不正确的。这不是什么单一的桥梁，而是一个复杂的、许多个工程建筑物的总合。首先，它包括一座横跨长江的双层大桥，即武汉长江大桥的正桥，它是全桥工程的主要组成部分。桥的上层铺有公路，下层铺有双轨铁路。其次，它包括有已经在1954年和1955年先后建成的汉水铁路桥和汉水公路桥（即江汉桥）。再次，它还包括有大小十座跨过街道和铁路线的跨线桥，三个新的大车站，联接桥头和车站的铁路、公路联络线，以及防御高水位的挡水墙等。前面讲到的修建长江大桥共用了不到四年的时间，正是指这样一个复杂的“总合”说的。其中长江大桥正桥本身的施工期只两年多一点。
    资产阶级右派分子向共产党、社会主义制度猖狂进攻的时候，大肆叫嚣说：共产党对工程技术是外行，不能领导工程建设，特别是大工程的建设；社会主义并不比资本主义优越，等等。那末，请问右派先生们：对武汉长江大桥工程如此迅速地建成这一事实，你们作如何解释呢？
    只要回忆对比一下解放前后武汉长江大桥的修建历史，右派分子的谰言是不难戳穿的。
    人们知道，在横亘我国南方和北方之间的浩瀚的长江上，有史以来一直是没有桥的。这并不是这样一座桥没有需要，相反，它是太需要了。没有桥，只是因为在旧中国人们无法把它修起来。
    武汉长江大桥是早经动议修建的。远在1911年和1913年，中国著名的工程师詹天佑就曾经先后两次发起筹建过武汉长江大桥。1913年，北洋大学桥梁系有十三个毕业生，同一个德籍教授一起来武汉第一次测量过桥址。可是，那时的军阀统治者对修建这座桥没有兴趣，不愿意支持他们。结果，测量过后也就算了，以后在很长一段时期内再没人来谈修桥的事。
    在这以后，到1930年和1936年，武汉长江大桥的筹建工作又进行过两次。1930年的那次，是一个叫华尔达的美国桥梁专家为了在中国作一笔赚钱生意，建议国民党反动政府设立机构来进行筹建工作的。当时，一批中国工程人员怀着满腔的热情来参加大桥的筹建工作，好像大桥势在必修一样了。可是结果呢？这位美国专家用了半年时间，在长江钻了八个孔，在汉水钻了两个孔，以后就无声无息了。为什么会这样？原来，华尔达为了赚大钱，设计了一座造价很高的桥式，而蒋介石本来就是为装门面才同意搞筹建工作的，一听说花钱多就不愿干了。这样，热闹一时的大桥筹建计划又成了泡影。1936年那次，筹建工作是钱塘江桥工程处派工程师梅暘春等来进行的。因为经费困难，他们采取劝募投资的方式来经营大桥工程。为了刺激当时的豪绅权贵们的投资兴趣，他们故意地把造价订得低些，并宣传说桥修好以后过一次桥收一次费，多少年以后就可以把本利一起赚回，可是这样也募不起多少钱来。一年以后，他们把工程计划方案作出来了，但因无钱，不得不把筹建工作搁置起来。
    十年又飞快地过去了。到1946年和1947年，长江大桥的筹建工作又先后进行了两次。头一次是一批中国工程师负责进行的，结果同样因为经费困难而没有搞出什么名堂。第二次，是美国顾问团提出了所谓“三孔大吊桥式”的筹建计划，因为设计本身的不合理，施工队伍也组织不起来，再加上国民党反动统治者不愿出钱，这次筹建工作又破产了。
    这就是新中国诞生以前修建武汉长江大桥的辛酸史。可以看到，无论是北洋军阀也好，国民党反动统治者也好，美帝国主义的专家、顾问们也好，他们对修建这座桥是没有什么兴趣的。他们最关心的是赚钱、打内战、装门面。在这种状况下，中国人民修建长江大桥的多年愿望，中国工程人员为此所作的各种努力，只能付诸东流。解放以前，长江两岸有这样一首歌谣：“黄河水，长江桥，治不好，修不了。”这对旧中国的实际状况来说真是千真万确的断语。
    1949年新中国诞生以后，为了配合国家建设面临的宏伟任务，实现我国人民的多年愿望，修建武汉长江大桥很快就被提到议事日程上来了。建国以后的第二年，即1950年，当时的政务院就责成铁道部进行这座桥的勘测设计工作。1953年，经过初步勘测以后，筹建工作正式开始。1954年2月，政务院正式通过了关于修建武汉长江大桥的决定。
    工程开工以后，共产党和人民政府陆续输送了大批优秀干部、久经锻炼的共产党员到大桥工程中担任工作。开始的时候，他们基本上都是不懂桥梁建设的外行，但他们有着忠于社会主义事业的坚强的决心，有着善于依靠群众、团结群众的工作方法，并且善于在工作中不断地学习提高。这些，再加上全国人民的支援和苏联专家的帮助，他们终于把一支庞大的桥梁建设队伍组织起来，领导人们在汉水和长江上展开战斗。几年来，他们是遇到过许多这样或那样的困难的。本来，既然一切都得从实践中摸索前进，困难当然在所难免。但是由于以上种种因素，困难并没有压倒他们，而总是被他们出色地领导着群众一一克服了。
    可以举出许许多多足以说明这种情形的例子，就拿对长江大桥工程意义极大的新施工方法——“大型管柱钻孔法”的创造经过来说吧！在这个方法提出以前，由于种种原因，世界上旧有的桥梁施工方法在长江上无法采用，大桥的设计曾经处于基本停顿的状态。后来，苏联专家工作组把上述新施工方法提出来了，但在当时，一部分中国工程人员对它却是怀疑甚至反对的。中共长江大桥工程局委员会为了说服那些对新施工方法怀疑甚至反对的人，组织了技术辩论，提出要先组织试验以后再正式使用，以便用事实教育大家。在试验过程中，党委进行了一系列的政治组织工作，教育职工认真地和专家合作，党委的负责人也亲自日日夜夜地参加试验。经过了这一系列的工作，新施工方法才试验成功，有不同意见的中国工程师们也被说服。新施工方法在工程中成功运用的结果，整个工程中最复杂、重要的基础施工问题得到了良好的解决，促使工程以难以想像的速度进行和完成。
    共产党究竟能不能领导工程技术呢？社会主义是否比资本主义优越呢？从前面所述的事实中，人们是可以得到正确的回答的。
