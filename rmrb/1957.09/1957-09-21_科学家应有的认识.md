Scientists' Due Understanding

    Around this time last year, we left the United States and stepped into our motherland, which we had been away from for many years. The Shenzhen customs officers' amiable and approachable attitude, the sprouting of new factories, enterprises, and schools all over the country like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, the self-sufficiency in the production of cars, jet planes, and many light and heavy machines that we had always relied on imports for, the planned development of all walks of life, and the significant improvement in the living standards of the broad masses of the people. All of this far exceeded our highest estimates while abroad.

    The Communist Party is the True Expert Leader of Scientific Undertakings

    During the rectification campaign, right-wing elements abandoned these unprecedented achievements, deliberately exaggerated shortcomings, and frantically attacked the Party, attempting to bring down the Communist Party and drag the country back to the old road of capitalist society. We are extremely indignant about this.

    Right-wing elements put forward reactionary programs in scientific work, saying that "laymen cannot lead experts," blatantly attempting to seize the Party's leadership over scientific work. Since right-wing elements want to sing about "laymen" and "experts" here, then it is necessary for us to clarify what the significance of leading scientific work entails. According to our experience, scientific leadership does not mean being proficient in all disciplines and guiding specific research work, but rather mastering the research direction, formulating research plans, ensuring research conditions, organizing research forces, etc., so that every scientific worker can exert their greatest potential in accordance with the needs of socialist construction. Facts show that the Chinese Communist Party is not only able to lead science but also leads it very well. The national long-term plan for scientific development formulated last year is an example.

    The scope of modern science is extremely broad, and the division of labor in various disciplines is also very detailed. Due to the limited time and energy of one person, it is already very difficult to fully master a certain field in a certain discipline, and it is simply a fantasy to demand a "versatile scientist" who is proficient in multiple sciences. Taking sanitary engineering as an example, it is only a small department in civil engineering. At present, it is not without problems to select a truly qualified "expert" leader in sanitary engineering as defined by the right-wing elements. Many people who call themselves experts are not actually scientists who are proficient in all the details of a science. They are not the true "experts" required by socialist scientific research institutions.

    Our country's guiding ideology is Marxism-Leninism. Only the Communist Party, which fully grasps Marxism, is the true "expert" leader of socialist scientific work.

    Who Truly Cares for Scientists?

    Some right-wing elements are clamoring for "protecting scientists," as if scientists in our socialist country have been subjected to some threats and persecution. However, which social system's scientists truly need protection?

    According to our experience in the United States, it is the progressive scientists in capitalist countries who truly need protection. In the various agencies, schools, and factories in the United States, there are specialized institutions responsible for investigating and mastering all personnel information (including amateur activities), and these institutions have close ties with the US intelligence agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

    In the university where we worked, a physics professor was dismissed by the school authorities before the end of the semester because someone said that he had close dealings with communists when he was a student. Since then, he had been idle at home for several years. He first sold his car and furniture, and then sold his house. His life was extremely difficult, and he had not found a job when we left the United States last year.

    Now let's look at how our country treats scientists. In order to ensure that scientists can carry out research work, our country has made appropriate arrangements in many aspects (including life), which is known to everyone. Even in this rectification campaign, a small number of scientists, including professors, deliberately distorted facts and slandered the government, and some even organized small political cliques in an attempt to overthrow the Party's leadership. However, the Party and the government have always been patiently reasoning with them, and as long as they can awaken and reform, they can still be forgiven by the people. This situation is simply incomparable for scientists living under the socialist system compared to capitalist countries.

    There are also some people who are dissatisfied with our country's current "planned scientific research" and fantasize about implementing the so-called "free research" in capitalist countries. According to our personal experience, this "free research" does not exist in capitalist society. Taking research work in factories and enterprises as an example, the direction of research has long been determined by capitalists according to their needs and interests. Scientists are only hired to carry out this task, and those who are unwilling to do so can only resign. Most of the research projects in schools are also commissioned or funded by factories, enterprises, or fund committees composed of some large capitalists. Scientists have little room for choice in research topics.

    In general, scientific research work under the capitalist social system can only serve a small number of capitalists. If the research is detrimental to the capitalists, it will not work. It is reported that a scientist has developed a long-life car tire. With this kind of durable tire, one set is enough for each new car, and it does not need to be replaced frequently. If this happened in our social system, the government would definitely strongly support and promote it; however, it is different in capitalist society. Because if this new tire is mass-produced, it will directly affect the turnover of existing rubber merchants, which is detrimental to the capitalists. As a result, this research result was also bought by the capitalists and buried. Is this the "freedom of research" we want?

    In capitalist countries, there is "freedom to choose a career," and capitalists also have the "freedom to dismiss employees at any time." When dismissing, it is usually given two weeks' notice, and the job and salary are terminated after the expiration. We often lived in fear in the United States, and only after returning to China did we fundamentally eliminate this fear and threat.

    We believe that if we don't compare certain superficial material enjoyments, we really can't see what happiness scientists in capitalist society have that is worth envying.

    Scientists Should Have a Firm Socialist Stand

    This anti-rightist struggle is the first large-scale political struggle and ideological struggle movement we have participated in since returning to China. Through this movement, we have realized that to be a truly socialist scientific worker, one should have at least two basic conditions: first, to have a firm stand, and second, to be able to put the interests of the collective above personal interests.

    Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen said at the enlarged meeting of the Science Association: "If a scientist cannot clearly stand on the socialist position, he may be used by the enemies of the people. In this way, even if he has rich knowledge, he will not only fail to contribute to the people, but may even cause losses to the country." What is the socialist position of scientists? We believe that it is to fully recognize the socialist road in the development of scientific undertakings, and to advance steadily in a planned and focused manner under the leadership of the Communist Party, which leads socialist construction.

    Scientists trained in capitalist society, especially those like us who have just returned from capitalist countries, although we have good wishes to build the motherland, are far inferior to those old cadres who were born and died for the revolutionary cause. We should learn from those old cadres and learn their spirit of "selflessness." Put the interests of the people and the collective first.

    In the short year since returning to China, we have learned a lot. From this anti-rightist struggle, we have further realized the importance of ideological transformation. Only by grasping ideological transformation can we closely unite around the Party and make more contributions to socialist construction.

    科学家应有的认识
    城市建设部科学研究所研究员　林作砥
    中国科学院化学研究所副研究员　徐水月
    去年的这个时候，我们离开了美国，跨进了阔别多年的祖国。深圳海关工作人员和蔼可亲的工作态度，祖国各地新工厂企业学校像雨后春笋般的生长，汽车、喷气飞机以及许多一直依靠进口的轻重型机器也能够自制生产，各行各业都在有计划的发展，广大人民的生活水平也有了显著的提高。这一切远远超过了我们在国外最高的估计。
    共产党是科学事业真正内行的领导
    在整风运动中，右派分子却抛开了这些史无前例的成绩，故意夸大缺点，疯狂地向党进攻，企图搞垮共产党，把国家拖回到资本主义社会的旧道路。我们对此异常愤慨。
    右派分子在科学工作方面提出了反动性的纲领，说什么“外行不能领导内行”，明目张胆地要夺取党对科学工作的领导权。右派分子既然要在这里高唱什么“外行”“内行”，那么，我们就有必要弄清楚领导科学工作的意义是指些什么。根据我们的体会，科学领导并不是意味着要精通各门学科，要指导具体研究工作，而是在于掌握研究方向，制订研究规划，保证研究条件，组织研究力量等等，使每个科学工作者都能按照社会主义建设的需要，发挥最大的潜力。事实说明中国共产党不但能够领导科学而且领导得很好。去年制订的国家科学发展远景规划，就是一个例子。
    现代科学的范围包含极广，各门学科的分工也极细。由于一个人的时间精力有限，要完全掌握某种学科中的某一部门已经很不容易，而要求有通晓多种科学的“万能科学家”，那简直是幻想。拿卫生工程学来说，它只是土木工程中的一个小部门，目前要想在国内选择一位真正符合右派分子说的，“名副其实”的卫生工程的“内行”领导，不是没有问题的。许多自称为内行的人，事实上也既不是精通一门科学中各种细目的科学家。并不是社会主义科学研究所要求的真正“内行”。
    我们国家的指导思想是马克思列宁主义。只有完全掌握了马克思主义的共产党才是社会主义科学工作的真正“内行”的领导。
    究竟是谁真正关怀科学家
    有些右派分子嚷着要“保护科学家”，似乎在我们社会主义国家里的科学家受到了什么威胁与迫害似的。然而，到底那种社会制度下的科学家需要保护呢？
    根据我们在美国的体会，真正需要保护的却是资本主义国家里的进步科学家。在美国的各机关学校工厂中，都设有专门机构负责调查及掌握一切人事资料（包括业余活动在内），这些机构与美国特务机关联邦调查局都有密切的关系。
    在我们工作的那个大学中有一位物理学教授，就因为有人说他做学生的时候曾经与共产党人有密切往来，学校当局没有等到学期终了就将他解聘了。从此他一直闲在家中好几年，他先卖了汽车家具，后来又把房子卖了，生活极为困难，当我们去年离美的时候他还没找到工作。
    现在再看看我们国家是如何对待科学家的。为了保证科学家进行研究工作，我们国家曾从多方面（包括生活）作了适当安排，这是大家都知道的。就是在这次整风运动中，有少数科学家包括教授，蓄意歪曲事实，污蔑政府，有的还组织政治小集团，企图推翻党的领导。然而党和政府一直是在耐心的与他们说理，只要他们能觉悟自新还是能得到人民的宽恕。这种情况，生活在社会主义制度中的科学家同资本主义国家比较起来，简直不可同日而语。
    还有一部分人不满意我们国家现行的“计划科学研究”，幻想施行资本主义国家中的所谓“自由研究”。根据我们亲身的经验，这种“自由研究”在资本主义社会中是不存在的。拿工厂企业中的研究工作来说，研究的方向早就由资本家根据他们的需要与利益规定好了，科学家不过是雇来执行这个任务而已，不愿意干的只有辞职。学校中的研究项目也大多数是由工厂企业或者是某些大资本家组成的基金委员会委托或资助的。科学家对研究题目没有什么选择的余地。
    总的说来，在资本主义社会制度之下的科学研究工作，只能是为少数资本家们服务的。如果研究的东西对资本家不利，那是行不通的。据悉有一位科学家研究出一种长寿命的汽车胎，用这种耐久的车胎每部新车子一付就够了，不需时常更换。这种事情假使发生在我们的这种社会制度中，政府一定会大力支持和推广；但是，在资本主义的社会中就不同了。因为这种新车胎如果真的大量生产就会直接影响现有橡胶商的营业额，这是对资本家不利的，结果，这个研究成果亦就被资本家们收买下来，而就此埋没了。难道这是我们所要的“研究自由”吗？
    在资本主义的国家里有“选择职业的自由”，资本家也有随时“辞退雇员的自由”。在辞退时普通是给两个星期的通知，过期即停职停薪了。我们在美国就经常提心吊胆的过日子，回国以后，才根本消除这种恐怖与威胁。
    我们认为如果要不拿某些表面的物质享受来比较的话，真是看不出资本主义社会中的科学家有些什么幸福值得我们羡慕的。
    科学家应有坚定的社会主义立场
    这次反右派斗争是我们回国以后参加第一个规模最大的政治斗争和思想斗争运动，通过了这次运动，我们体会到要做一个真正为社会主义服务的科学工作者应该具备有两个起码的条件：第一是要有坚定的立场，第二是要能把集体的利益放在个人利益之上。
    聂荣臻副总理在科联扩大会议上曾说过：“一个科学家如果不能明确地站到社会主义立场，就有可能被人民的敌人所利用。这样，即使他有丰富的知识，不但不能对人民有贡献，甚至对国家造成损失”。什么是科学家的社会主义立场呢？我们认为就是要完全承认在发展科学事业中走社会主义的道路，要在领导社会主义建设的共产党领导下有计划，有重点的稳步前进。
    在资本主义社会中训练出来的科学家，尤其是像我们这样刚从资本主义国家回来不久的人，虽然有着建设祖国的良好愿望，却远不如那些工农出身曾为革命事业出生入死的老干部那么我们应该向他们那些老干部看齐，学习他们的“忘我”的精神。把人民集体的利益放在第一位。
    回国后短短的一年中，我们学到了不少的东西。从这次反右派斗争中更体会到思想改造的重要。只有抓紧思想改造，才能紧密地团结在党的周围，为社会主义建设做出更多的贡献。
