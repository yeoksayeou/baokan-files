Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 14th: The Egyptian newspaper "Al-Akhbar" published a statement on September 13th by the Director of Syrian Army Intelligence, Sarraj, stating that "it is a great honor for the Syrian people that no more than four million Syrians can rise up to confront the United States, which possesses atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and missiles. U.S. weapons cannot intimidate us."

Sarraj told the "Al-Akhbar" reporter that when imperialists transport military supplies to Syria's neighboring countries, they forget that these countries "are Arab countries like us." Jordanian soldiers will never kill Syrian brothers, and Iraqi soldiers will never stand with Israeli soldiers against Syria.

He also said, "The United States divides the world into two parts: one is the U.S. part, and the other is the non-U.S. part. Either you stand on the side of the United States and link your country's policies and interests with the policies and interests of imperialism, or you are not on the side of the United States, and in their eyes, this means you have become communists."

Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: Cairo dispatch: According to a broadcast from Cairo Radio on September 13th, Saudi Arabian Minister of Transport Prince Zorltan said in Cairo that if Syria is attacked, Saudi Arabia "will never stand idly by."

The minister said that if someone attacks Syria, Saudi Arabia "will not hesitate to do what it should do for Syria, just as it did in the war against Egypt last October."

Zorltan arrived in Cairo on September 12th from Baden, West Germany, where Saudi Arabian King Saud is receiving medical treatment.

According to a report from Baghdad, Saudi Arabian Ambassador to Iraq Ibrahim Heller Suweir also made the same statement on September 12th. The ambassador said: In the event of any aggression, "we will take measures in accordance with the Arab League Collective Security Treaty and the bilateral alliance concluded between Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Egypt."

　　叙陆军情报处长说
　　美国武器吓不倒叙利亚
　　沙特阿拉伯表示支持叙利亚对付侵略
    据新华社开罗14日电  埃及“消息报”13日刊载叙利亚陆军情报处处长萨拉杰的谈话说，“不超过四百万人口的叙利亚人民能够起来对抗拥有原子弹和氢弹以及导弹的美国，这是叙利亚人民的极大光荣。美国的武器是吓不住我们的。”
    萨拉杰对“消息报”记者说，帝国主义分子在运输军火给叙利亚的邻国时，忘记了这些国家“是同我们一样的阿拉伯国家”。约旦士兵决不会杀害叙利亚兄弟，伊拉克士兵也决不会同以色列士兵一起反对叙利亚。
    他又说：“美国把世界分成两个部分：一个是美国部分，另一个是非美国部分。要么你就站在美国这一边，把你们国家的政策和利益同帝国主义的政策和利益联在一起，否则，你就不是站在美国这一边，而在他们看来，这就意味着你们变成了共产党人。”
    新华社14日讯  开罗消息：据开罗电台13日广播，沙特阿拉伯交通大臣佐尔坦亲王在开罗说，如果叙利亚受到攻击，沙特阿拉伯“决不袖手旁观”。
    这位大臣说，如果有人攻击叙利亚，沙特阿拉伯“将毫不犹豫地做它对叙利亚应做的工作，正如去年10月在对埃及战争中所做的那样”。
    佐尔坦是在9月12日从西德的巴登到达开罗的，沙特阿拉伯国王沙特正在那里治病。
    据巴格达消息，沙特阿拉伯驻伊拉克大使易卜拉欣·赫勒苏韦勒9月12日也作了同样的表示。这位大使说：万一发动任何侵略的话，“我们将根据阿拉伯联盟集体安全条约以及沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚和埃及所缔结的双边联盟来采取措施。”
