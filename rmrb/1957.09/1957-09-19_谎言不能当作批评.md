　　Lies Cannot Be Considered Criticism
　　Yi Huai
    At the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress, rightist Peng Wenying shot a poisonous cold arrow at the Party, saying that his crime was only that he "talked too little about the achievements in the past, and asked to be given a chance to praise the fifteen great achievements of new China at the People's Congress." Some rightists, when their crimes were exposed, often retreated in pretense but actually counterattacked, like Peng Wenying, saying that their mistake was only talking about shortcomings and not talking about achievements. The implication was nothing more than: the Party only allows praise and does not allow criticism.
    What is the rightists' "criticism"? Please see the letter from Zhang Bojun published in the People's Daily on July 7. This rightist ringleader, in order to attack the leading cadres of the Communist Party, and to show that the Communist Party's "days are numbered," said at the meeting of six professors he convened: "Most of the members of the State Planning Commission are Communist Party members, but big-character posters demanding the removal of Li Fuchun have already been posted at Li's office door." The comrades of the Planning Commission protested to Zhang Bojun, exposing that his remarks were completely fabricated out of thin air. Zhang Bojun had to write a letter to the People's Daily in embarrassment to admit that he was spreading rumors from a reactionary standpoint. Liu Wang Liming, a key member of Luo Longji's reactionary clique, when attacking the social order of the new society, solemnly cited such an example, saying that in Wang Kui Village, Sanhe County, Hebei Province, the father of a demobilized soldier strangled his son, whom he had not seen for many years and did not recognize, to death in order to rob him of money. However, after investigation, there was no such village or event in Sanhe County. Open any newspaper, and the similar lies of rightists that are exposed are simply too numerous to mention. Can these fabrications and lies, which have no basis in fact, be considered criticism?
    Some people may say that although the rightists have fabricated many rumors, sometimes they do touch upon the Party's shortcomings to some extent. That's right, but we still have to see how the rightists talk about the Party's shortcomings. Some people say that rightists treat the Party's shortcomings with a microscope. As soon as a little cloud appears in the clear sky, they describe it as dark clouds covering the sky, and a storm is about to arrive. They can exaggerate the Party's shortcomings tenfold, a hundredfold, or even a thousandfold. The shortcomings in the style of individual Party members can become the basis for them to negate the entire Party; certain shortcomings in the implementation of policies can become the basis for opposing the Party's policies. If they discover that a certain Party leading cadre has a bit of bureaucracy, they will call for all the leaders to "step down" and quickly "give way to the virtuous."
    Why do the rightists do this? Of course, it is not a deviation in understanding, but to negate, oppose, and even defeat the leadership of the Party. Truly well-intentioned criticism is to make the Party more consolidated and stronger, and to make the Party's leadership more firm and correct. Is there any similarity between the two?

　　谎言不能当作批评
　　易槐
    在上海市人民代表会上，右派分子彭文应向党放出一枝恶毒的冷箭，他说，他的罪过只是“过去对成绩谈得太少了，要求给他一个机会在人代会上歌颂一下新中国十五个方面的伟大成就”。有一些右派分子，当他们的罪行被揭露出来的时候，往往和彭文应一样佯做退却实则反扑，说什么错误在于只讲缺点没讲成绩。言外之意无非是：党只许歌颂不许批评。
    右派分子的“批评”是些什么呢？请看7月7日人民日报上登载的章伯钧的来信。这个右派头子为了攻击共产党的领导干部，为了说明共产党的“大势已去”，在他召集的六教授会议上说：“国家计划委员会大部分都是共产党员，可是要求撤换李富春的大字报已贴到李的办公室门口”。计划委员会的同志们向章伯钧提出了抗议，揭穿他的谈话完全是无中生有的捏造，章伯钧才狼狈不堪的写信给人民日报承认这是他站在反动的立场上造谣。罗隆基反动小集团的骨干分子刘王立明，在攻击新社会社会秩序的时候，曾经煞有介事地举出了这样一个例子，她说，河北省三河县有个王奎村。王奎村一个复员军人的父亲，为了抢劫钱财，竟然把分别多年已不认识的刚从部队复员回来的儿子掐死了。可是，经过调查，三河县是既无其村又无其事。打开每天的报刊，被揭露的右派分子的类似谎言简直是举不胜举。这些毫无事实根据的捏造和撒谎。这难道能够算是批评？
    有人会说，右派分子虽然造了不少谣，可是，有时候他们也多少接触到了党的缺点。这不错，可是，我们还得看看右派分子究竟是怎样谈到党的缺点的。有人说右派分子是拿着显微镜来对待党的缺点的。晴空上刚刚出现一点云霓，他们就要形容成乌云遮天，暴风雨顷刻就要到来。他们可以把党的缺点夸大到十倍、百倍以至千倍。个别党员作风上的缺点，可以成为他们否定整个党的根据；执行政策中的某些缺点，可以成为反对党的政策的根据。发现某一党员领导干部有点官僚主义，他们就要叫所有的领导者“下台”，赶快“让位于贤”。
    右派分子为什么要这样呢？当然不是什么认识上的偏差，而是为了否定、反对、以至打垮党的领导。真正善意的批评，则是为了使党更巩固更强大，使党的领导更坚强更正确。二者之间难道有丝毫共同之处吗？
