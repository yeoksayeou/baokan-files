Thanks to the development of the socialist construction cause throughout the country in recent years, and the implementation of the Party and the state's tasks in ethnic issues, health work in minority areas has developed rapidly, and the historically backward health conditions are gradually being improved.

According to statistics from the end of 1956, the health department system in minority areas across the country had 508 hospitals, with more than 13,700 beds; 6 sanatoriums, with more than 300 beds; more than 1,500 medical and health centers (stations); 93 specialized prevention and treatment centers (stations); more than 150 health and epidemic prevention stations; 61 medical and epidemic prevention teams; 18 prevention and treatment groups; one traditional Chinese and Mongolian medicine research institute; and 17 other health institutions. In total, there were more than 27,000 health technicians, including more than 1,800 senior personnel, more than 12,500 intermediate personnel, more than 10,900 junior personnel, and more than 1,600 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. The development of hospital beds increased by 146.9% in 1956 compared to 1953, outpatient departments and district health clinics increased by 149.3%, and maternal and child health centers (stations) increased by 316.3%. Before liberation, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region had no health care institutions with modern technology and equipment that truly served the people, except for some scattered ethnic medicine practitioners (mostly Lama doctors). Now, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has 23 general hospitals, 79 county health centers, 3 specialized hospitals, with more than 3,300 beds; more than 160 medical and health centers, 2 sanatoriums (institutes), with more than 100 beds; 10 health and epidemic prevention stations; 26 maternal and child health centers (stations); 40 medical and epidemic prevention teams (groups); 26 specialized prevention and treatment centers (stations); one traditional Chinese and Mongolian medicine research institute; and 4 other health institutions. There are more than 6,800 health technicians, including more than 560 senior personnel, more than 3,400 intermediate personnel, more than 2,100 junior personnel, more than 670 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, and 5 researchers. In the Tibet region, before liberation, there were no other medical institutions except for the Tibetan Local Mentseekhang (Lama Medical College). Now, the region has 22 medical and health institutions. People's hospitals with complete technology and equipment have been established in Lhasa, Shigatse, and Qamdo. Seventeen health centers (institutes) have also been established in the region. At present, more than 450 health technicians have been transferred from the mainland to work in Tibet, including more than 100 senior physicians. In the ethnic minority areas of Yunnan's border regions, more than 290 various types of health care institutions have been established in recent years. Ethnic minority health technicians account for 40% of the health technicians in Yunnan's border regions, which has played a significant role in opening up ethnic health work in the border regions.

In terms of medical education, according to statistics from October 1956, there were 1,590 ethnic minority students studying in medical colleges and universities across the country, more than double the number in 1952. In 1956, two medical colleges were newly built in the Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang autonomous regions, mainly for training senior ethnic minority health personnel. In order to ensure the training of more senior ethnic minority health personnel, the Beijing Medical College continued to run ethnic minority student classes, with 220 students currently studying at the school. Regarding the training of intermediate health personnel, in the intermediate health schools in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Liaoning, and more than ten other provinces, in addition to the 2,230 ethnic students who have graduated from 1953 to the summer of this year, there are currently more than 3,670 ethnic students enrolled. Various effective measures such as on-the-job training and short-term training have also been adopted in various places to train a large number of junior health personnel such as midwives and health workers. These ethnic health cadres have played a huge role in carrying out medical prevention, health and epidemic prevention, maternal and child health, and health publicity work in the vast rural, pastoral, and mountainous areas of ethnic minority regions.

Due to the rapid development of medical and health institutions and the continuous increase of medical cadres, the unsanitary conditions and the prevalence of diseases in minority areas have gradually changed. In recent years, 250,000 sexually transmitted disease patients have been treated in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Gansu, Qinghai and other regions. At present, some regions have basically controlled the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. For example, in the pastoral areas of Hulunbuir, Chahar, and Xilingol leagues in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the incidence rate has dropped from 47.2% to 18.4%, greatly reducing the chance of infection. In addition, due to the vigorous development of maternal and child health work in these areas, the implementation of scientific delivery and new parenting methods, the fertility rate of women has gradually increased, the infant mortality rate has decreased year by year, and the population has increased significantly, changing the trend of population decline in previous years. For example, the infant mortality rate in the Xilingol grassland has dropped from 318 per thousand in 1952 to 109 per thousand. Due to the widespread vaccination of cowpox, most areas have controlled the spread of smallpox, except for a few isolated cases of smallpox occasionally found in individual areas. Due to the training of a large number of primary malaria prevention personnel on the basis of mobilizing the masses, the establishment of prevention and treatment networks, the vigorous promotion of health publicity, the improvement of environmental hygiene, the promotion of drug mosquito control, and the prevention and treatment through medication, the key prevention and treatment areas have basically controlled the spread of malaria. For example, in the suburbs of Mangshi, Yunnan Province, the incidence rate of malaria from August to December 1952 was 70.2%, which dropped to 6% in the same period in 1955. Gengma, Mangshi and other places, which were once known as ultra-high malaria epidemic areas, have now controlled the spread of malaria.

    少数民族地区卫生落后状况逐步改善
    医疗卫生机构迅速发展，基本上控制了传染病的流行
    本报讯  几年来，随着全国社会主义建设事业的发展，以及党和国家在民族问题方面的任务的实现，少数民族地区卫生工作有了迅速的发展，历史上遗留下来的卫生落后状况正在逐步地得到改善。
    根据1956年底的统计，全国少数民族地区卫生部系统医院已有五百零八所，病床一万三千七百多张；疗养院六所，病床三百多张；医疗保健所（站）一千五百多个；专科防治所（站）九十三个；卫生防疫站一百五十多个，医疗防疫队六十一个；防治组十八个，中蒙医研究所一个，其他卫生事业机构十七个。总共有卫生技术人员二万七千多名，其中高级人员一千八百多名，中级人员一万二千五百多名，初级人员一万零九百多名，中医中药人员一千六百多名。医院病床的发展，1956年比1953年增加了146.9％，门诊部及区卫生所增加了149.3％，妇幼保健所（站）增加了316.3％。内蒙古自治区解放前除有一些散在的民族医（绝大多数是喇嘛医）外，根本没有一个真正为人民服务的具有现代技术设备的卫生医疗机构。而现在，内蒙古自治区已有综合医院二十三所，县卫生院七十九所，专科医院三所，病床三千三百多张；医疗保健所一百六十多个，疗养院（所）二个，床位一百多张；卫生防疫站十个；妇幼保健所（站）二十六个；医疗防疫队（组）四十个；专科防治所（站）二十六个；中蒙医研究所一个，其他卫生事业机构四个。共有卫生技术人员六千八百多名，其中高级人员五百六十多名，中级人员三千四百多名，初级人员二千一百多名，中医中药人员六百七十多名，研究人员五名。西藏地区，在解放前除西藏地方门孜康（喇嘛医学院）外，没有其他医疗机构，但现在，全区已有二十二个医疗卫生机构，在拉萨、日喀则、昌都设立了三个技术设备完善的人民医院，在区内还设立了十七个卫生院（所）。目前由内地调往西藏工作的卫生技术人员已达四百五十多名，其中高级医师有一百多名。在云南边疆民族地区，几年来也建立了各类卫生医疗机构二百九十几个，少数民族卫生技术人员占云南边疆卫生技术人员的40％，对开辟边疆地区的民族卫生工作起了很大的作用。
    在医学教育方面，据1956年10月统计，有一千五百九十名少数民族学生在全国各医学院校学习，比1952年增加了两倍多。1956年在内蒙古、新疆两个自治区各新建了一所以培养少数民族高级卫生人员为主的医学院。为了保证培养更多的少数民族高级卫生人员，还在北京医学院继续开办了少数民族学生班，目前有二百二十名学生在校学习。关于中级卫生人员的培养，在内蒙古、新疆两自治区及青海、甘肃、四川、云南、贵州、广西、辽宁等十多省的中级卫生学校中，除从1953年至今年暑期已毕业的二千二百三十名民族学生外，目前在校的民族学生有三千六百七十多名。各地还采取了就地带徒、短期训练等各种有效措施，培养了大批接生员、卫生员等初级卫生人员。这些民族卫生干部在开展民族地区广大农村、牧区、山区的医疗预防、卫生防疫、妇幼卫生和卫生宣传工作中都发挥了巨大的作用。
    由于医疗卫生机构的迅速发展，医疗干部的不断增加，少数民族地区的不卫生和疾病繁多的状况逐步得到改变。几年来，在内蒙古、新疆两自治区及甘肃、青海等地区治疗了二十五万名性病患者，目前有些地区已基本上控制了性病的蔓延，如内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔、察哈尔、锡林郭勒三盟牧区发病率，已由47.2％降到18.4％，传染机会大大减少。此外，由于在这些地区大力开展了妇幼卫生工作，推行了科学的接生和新育儿法，妇女生育率逐渐提高，婴儿死亡率逐年降低，人口显著上升，改变了历年来人口下降的趋势。如锡林郭勒草原婴儿死亡率已由1952年的千分之三百一十八下降到千分之一百零九。由于普种牛痘，除个别地区偶尔发现有少数天花病例以外，大部分地区已控制了天花的流行。由于在发动群众的基础上训练了大批初级防疟人员，建立了防治网，大力进行了卫生宣传工作，改善环境卫生，推广药物灭蚊以及通过服药预防和治疗，使重点防治的地区基本上控制了疟疾的流行，如云南省芒市郊区，1952年8月至12月的疟疾发病率为70.2％，1955年同时期就降为6％。曾被称为超高度疟疾流行区的耿马、芒市等地，目前已经控制了疟疾的流行。
