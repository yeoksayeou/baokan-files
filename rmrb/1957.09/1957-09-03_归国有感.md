Reflections on Returning to the Motherland
Wang Chengshu, Zhang Wenyu, Researchers at the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

We have been back in China for ten months. We have personally witnessed the achievements of our motherland's construction. The recent anti-Rightist struggle has also given us a very good education. Many Rightists envy capitalist countries, especially the so-called "freedom and democracy" of the United States. We lived in the United States for more than ten years and would like to talk about some of the facts we have seen and heard for everyone's reference.

Political Discrimination in Personnel Systems

American agencies, factories, and schools all have personnel and security departments. Their role is to investigate and collect all information about employees and potential employees, especially their political backgrounds. They cooperate with the FBI. Before hiring someone, the FBI investigates everything about that person everywhere. In addition to investigation, they use methods such as wiretapping and private letter checks to collect materials. Before employment, everyone must also fill out an extremely detailed personal history form. Anyone who conceals information or reports facts that do not conform to reality will encounter serious difficulties and even face legal sanctions.

Due to this system, in the past decade, many people in the United States have been fired because they or their relatives have "pro-communist suspicions." Sometimes even their parents or children lose their jobs at the same time, and children are beaten at school. It is almost impossible for those who have been fired to find another job.

We study physics and are relatively clear about the physics community. In the past few years, at least a dozen well-known professors in the physics community have been dismissed. Frank Oppenheimer (the younger brother of Oppenheimer, who led the development of the atomic bomb during World War II) and two of his colleagues were dismissed because they were former Communist Party members. They have been idle on their father's farm for ten years. Former Director of the National Bureau of Standards, Condon, was dismissed because his wife had "pro-communist suspicions." Later, he worked in two companies, but was dismissed because the government refused to revoke his "crime." He was unemployed for two years and only went to a university last fall to serve as the head of a department. However, this job probably won't last long. There are also some who are more fortunate and able to leave the United States and continue to work in physics, such as Peters, who is now studying cosmic rays in India, and Bohm, a theoretical physicist in Brazil.

The U.S. government monitors Chinese people very strictly. Student associations of Chinese students in the United States and the United Chinese Christian Association are all on the blacklist. They buy and lure some unscrupulous Chinese students to report the actions of other classmates and hire Taiwanese students to check Chinese people's letters.

Freedom of Speech and the Press

Our government allows American reporters to come to China for interviews, but the U.S. State Department has repeatedly made things difficult for them and prevented them from coming. Recently, under domestic public opinion pressure, they had to agree to let them come, but still imposed many restrictions and abandoned international practice by proposing non-reciprocal conditions. Doesn't this clearly show who erected the "bamboo curtain"?

The U.S. government simply does not allow the American people to know the real situation in China and the Soviet Union. Open the newspaper (there are also a few progressive newspapers, but subscribing to such newspapers often becomes one of the "crimes" of being pro-communist), and it is either propaganda for war, or car and plane accidents, or various murder news. When reporting on the situation in China, anything they think they can take advantage of is deliberately exaggerated, and major facts that cannot be concealed are distorted and slandered. For example, they repeatedly claimed that our suppression of counter-revolutionaries killed one or two million people; they said that our great construction projects were "forced labor" and aimed at endangering world peace. This kind of slander and rumor propaganda is spread in large quantities every day, making us in the United States also half-believing and half-doubting many things. This is American "freedom of the press." In addition to newspapers, radio, television, and movies also work for capitalists to carry out propaganda, and they are all controlled by an extremely strict censorship system. In the past few years, many film writers in Hollywood have been imprisoned for having more progressive ideas.

Most people do not dare to say many fair things for the sake of their jobs, and the more progressive people we know are becoming more and more silent. On our ship back to China, a waiter in the dining room said: "Everyone always says we have so much freedom and democracy, but if I dare to stand up today and say some facts about the lack of freedom and democracy, I will lose my job as a waiter tomorrow."

In schools, if student organizations invite progressive people to give speeches, they are often harassed and cannot borrow auditoriums.

Some people who have access to information that the government does not want the people to know are not allowed to speak by the government. Here is a good example: a biology professor who studied the harm of radioactive contamination from experimental atomic and hydrogen bombs to humans was not allowed by the government to publicly publish his research results and opinions. Last year, when the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy was held in Geneva, he was first not allowed to go as a representative. Later, he went in a private capacity, but was prevented from speaking.

Racial Discrimination

Racial discrimination is an extremely serious problem in the United States. They discriminate against blacks, Native Americans (American aborigines), Jews, and Asians. Native Americans are confined to several "reservations" and are almost extinct. Jews control a large part of capital, so their status is better, but they still inevitably suffer exclusion everywhere. Many schools, especially professional schools such as medical or law schools, stipulate that the number of Jews among students and even teachers must not exceed a certain proportion.

The situation of their treatment of blacks is even more unimaginable. There are more than 10 million blacks in the United States, accounting for about one-tenth of the U.S. population, but most blacks live inhuman lives. In several southern states, not only sidewalks, buses, and trams are segregated for blacks and whites, but even churches, schools, and hotels are separated. Even in Washington, this is the case for the very few black senior staff members in the government. Many hotels and cafeterias refuse to receive them, and they must live in dirty and dilapidated black areas. The laws of many states prohibit blacks and whites from marrying. Blacks nominally have the right to vote, but because they have been oppressed by whites for many years, their cultural level is low, and the percentage of illiteracy is relatively high. Racists use these facts to enact various harsh laws to deprive many blacks of their right to vote. In court, blacks and whites who commit the same crime are treated completely differently. In the South, whites who kill blacks can often be found not guilty. Many blacks cannot stand the racial persecution in the South and have to migrate to the North because racial discrimination in the North is not as serious in comparison. However, leaving their hometowns and having low cultural levels, they can only do rough work and remain poor. Our children noticed this when they were three or four years old and asked us why most of the coolies were black, which shows the general situation.

The United States treats Chinese people only slightly better than blacks. The lives of overseas Chinese are quite difficult, and even if they become American citizens, they are still excluded everywhere. Before World War II, although the children of overseas Chinese graduated from university with science and engineering degrees, there were quite a few who were forced to work in restaurants or laundries opened by relatives and friends. Their residences are also limited, and Chinese people can rarely buy or rent houses in better areas. We believe that Chinese students in the United States have all personally experienced some of these discriminatory treatments.

Children's Education

American parents and teachers encourage children to fight for their own interests at all costs. In snatching things and arguing, the child who loses not only does not receive sympathy, but is instead scolded for not having "self-defense ability." In order to make children understand the value of money, parents give rewards for doing some housework at home. For example, a five- or six-year-old child is paid a certain "wage" every day for taking out the wastepaper basket. This method trains people from an early age to work for money.

American children's books cannot be considered few, and they are printed quite beautifully, but the vast majority of children do not have good reading habits. We lived in a university town, and several bookstores all had children's book departments. We often took our children to these bookstores to buy books, and there were not many customers each time we went. On the second day of arriving in Beijing, we passed by Xinhua Bookstore and saw many children inside concentrating on reading. This situation—especially when compared with the situation in the United States that is still in our memory—gave us a very deep impression.

American children love to read "comic strips," which are mostly absurd and extremely cruel stories. The language is both vulgar and ungrammatical, causing children to learn some nondescript English.

In addition to comic strips, American children also like to watch television. According to statistics, school-age children spend more than twenty hours a week on television. The content of television programs is similar to that of comic strips, mostly crude, cruel, and distorted adventure stories. In recent years, many juvenile delinquency cases have been influenced by television and comic strips. Some children even admit that their criminal behavior is just a reenactment of the stories they saw on television or in comic strips.

On the other hand, there are some restrictions on children's reading materials in the United States. For example, the story of Robin Hood (similar to some Chinese martial arts novels about robbing the rich and helping the poor), some education officials advocate that children should not be allowed to read it, on the grounds that the spirit of this kind of story is too close to communist ideology!

Impressions of Returning to the Motherland

The main reason we returned to China was driven by patriotic ideas; on the other hand, we felt that continuing to live in that kind of social environment was unfair to our children. Of course, the continuous improvement of our motherland's international status under the leadership of the Communist Party in recent years also had a great influence on our decision to return. To be honest, before returning to China, we knew very little about the domestic situation and were half-believing and half-doubting about the Party and the government. Our trust in the Party only began from the first step we took into the gate of our motherland.

We have personally seen the actual situation of our motherland, which is much better than our most optimistic estimates in the United States. The Rightists say that the standard of living is lower now. Although we do not understand politics, we have seen the facts. Of course, from the perspective of the American standard of living, we are indeed still lower now, but it is much higher than in the past. If we say that the Communist Party and the government are not for the people, then we really don't know what they are for.

We are amazed by the progress made in education and scientific research in our motherland in recent years. Whether in terms of lineup, equipment, or actual work, there is a world of difference even compared with the most prosperous era before the war. Taking physics as an example, although we have not yet reached the international level (in fact, eight short years are not enough to lay the foundation for science), judging from the current situation, it has begun to take root. Some people say that the Party cannot lead science. Our view is just the opposite. The achievements of these years are a clear proof. The development of science should be in line with the needs of the country, so there must be an overall plan. Individual scientists tend to be one-sided and focus on their own departments. Only the Party can start from a comprehensive and objective point of view and take overall consideration of the needs of the country.

In the past, we heard that there were many meetings in the new society, and we often felt that we could not understand why it took so much time to hold meetings. Now we gradually understand that some meetings are still necessary. At the same time, we also believe that scientific workers have an obligation to appropriately participate in some social work.

We returned to China not long ago and our understanding was very poor. This anti-Rightist struggle can be regarded as a very good crash course in politics for us. It made us deeply feel the necessity of strengthening theoretical study.

    归国有感
    中国科学院物理研究所研究员  王承书  张文裕
    我们回国已有十个月了。我们亲眼看到祖国建设的成绩。最近期间的反右派斗争，又使我们受到一次很好的教育。许多右派分子很羡慕资本主义国家，特别是美国的所谓“自由民主”。我们在美国住了十多年，很愿意把我们曾经看见和听到的一部分事实谈谈，供大家参考。
    人事制度中的政治歧视
    美国的机关、工厂和学校都有人事科与安全科。它们的作用是调查与收集所有的雇员及准备雇用的对象的一切资料，特别是这些人的政治背景。它们与联邦调查局合作，在雇用一个人之前，联邦调查局到各处调查这个人的一切。他们除调查外，还用偷听电话，私查信件等补充办法来收集材料。在就业前，每人还要填写极详尽的个人历史的表格，凡有隐瞒不报，或报告不符合事实时，就会遭遇严重的困难，甚至受到法律的制裁。
    由于这种制度，近十年来，美国有很多人因为自己或亲友有“亲共嫌疑”而被解雇。有时连他们的父母或子女，也同时丧失工作，孩子们还会在学校遭受殴打。被解雇的人要再找到职业，几乎不可能。
    我们是学物理的，对物理学界比较清楚。过去几年中，物理学界知名的教授被解聘的，至少有十几个人。佛兰克·奥本海姆（第二次世界大战时，领导制造原子弹的奥本海姆的弟弟）和他的两个同事，就是因为过去是共产党员而被解聘，到现在已将十年，一直在他父亲遗下的农庄中闲住着。前国家标准局局长康登，因为他的妻子有“亲共嫌疑”而被免职，后来连着在两个公司工作，都因政府不予撤销“罪名”而被解雇，赋闲两年，去秋才到一个大学担任系主任。不过这份职业恐怕也不能保持多久。也有比较幸运的，能够离开美国，在物理方面继续工作，例如现在在印度研究宇宙线的彼得斯和在巴西的理论物理学家波姆。
    美国政府对中国人监视得很严。各校留美学生的学生会和中国学生基督教联合会等，都是黑名单上的组织。他们收买和利诱一些不肖的中国学生，向他们报告其他同学的行动，并且雇用台湾学生检查中国人的信件。
    言论与新闻“自由”
    我们的政府准许美国的记者来中国采访，但是美国国务院却一再留难，不让他们来，最近在国内舆论压力下不得不同意让他们来，仍然诸多限制，而且背弃国际惯例提出不能互惠的条件。这不是明确的说明“竹幕”是谁树立的吗？
    美国政府根本不让美国人民知道中国和苏联的真实情况。打开报纸一看（也有少数的进步的报纸，但是订阅这种报纸，常常会成为亲共“罪行”之一），不是宣扬战争，就是汽车飞机失事，或者各种杀人的新闻。对中国情况的报道，凡是他们认为有机可乘的，就故意夸大，实在掩盖不了的重大事实，就进行歪曲和污蔑。例如一再宣传我们的肃反杀了一、二千万人；对我们的伟大工程建设，就说是“强迫劳动”，而且目的是在危害世界和平。每天大量散布的这种诽谤和造谣宣传，使得在美国的我们，对许多事情也半信半疑。这就是美国的“新闻自由”。除报纸外，还有无线电、电视和电影等为资本家做宣传工作，它们都受到极严密的检查制度的控制。前几年好莱坞有不少电影作家因思想比较进步而入狱。
    一般人为了饭碗问题，许多公正的话都不敢讲，我们认识的比较进步的人，越来越沉默。在我们归国的船上，一个饭厅的服务员说：“大家总说我们多自由，多民主，但是我今天如果敢站起来说些没有自由和不民主的事实，明天我这服务员的工作就会丢了。”
    在学校里，学生组织如果请进步人士演讲，就往往受到刁难，借不到礼堂。
    有些人掌握了政府不愿让人民知道的资料，政府就不许他们说话。这里有一个很好的例子，有一位生物学教授，他研究实验原子弹及氢弹的放射性沾染对人类的危害，政府就不许他公开发表他的研究结果和他的意见。去年日内瓦举行国际和平利用原子能会议时，先是不许他当代表去赴会，后来他以私人名义去了，又阻止他发言。
    种族歧视
    种族歧视在美国是个极严重的问题。他们歧视黑人、印第安人（美洲土著）、犹太人及黄种人。印第安人被限制在几个“居留地”里，差不多绝种了。犹太人掌握着很大一部分资本，因此地位较好，不过仍然免不了处处遭受排挤。许多学校，特别是医学院或法学院等职业学校，都规定学生甚至于教师中的犹太人人数，不得超过一定的比例。
    他们对待黑人的情形，更是不堪设想。美国有一千多万黑人，约占美国人口的十分之一，然而大部分黑人过着非人的生活。南部几个州里，不仅行人道、公共汽车和电车，对黑人和白人实行隔离，甚至连教堂、学校和旅馆也一样分开。即使在华盛顿，对在政府任职的极少数的黑人高级工作人员，也不例外。许多旅馆和食堂都拒绝接待他们，他们必须住在又脏又破的黑人区。许多州的法律禁止黑人和白人通婚。黑人在名义上有选举权，但是因为多年受到白种人压迫，文化水平较低，不识字的百分比较高，种族主义者利用这些事实，订立种种苛刻法律，剥夺了许多黑人的选举权。在法庭上，黑人和白人犯同样的罪，所受的处分也完全不同。在南方，白人杀死黑人，往往可以被判无罪。许多黑人受不了南部的种族迫害，只好迁移到北部，因为北部的种族歧视比较起来，没有那么严重。然而离乡背井，文化水平又低，只好做些粗工，仍然穷困。我们的孩子在三、四岁时就注意到这一点，曾经问我们为什么苦力大半是黑人，情形可见一般。
    美国对待中国人，仅仅比对黑人略好一点。华侨的生活是相当困苦的，即使加入美国籍，仍然处处受人排斥。第二次世界大战前，华侨子弟虽在大学理工科毕业，但被迫在亲友开设的饭馆或洗衣店服务的，颇不乏人。他们的住所，也有限制，在环境较好的地区，中国人很少能买到或租到房子。我们相信，中国的留美学生，没有不亲身经历过一些这种歧视待遇的。
    儿童教育
    美国的家长和教师都鼓励孩子们不顾一切，为自己的利益奋斗。在抢东西和争执时，输了的孩子不但得不到同情，相反的却被斥为没有“自卫能力”。为使小孩了解金钱的可贵，父母让孩子们在家里做些家务事都要给予报酬。例如五、六岁的孩子为家里倒字纸篓，每天就有若干“工资”。这种办法从小就训练了人们为赚钱而工作的观念。    美国的儿童读物，不能算不多，印刷得也颇精美，但是绝大多数的孩子，都没有好的阅读习惯。我们住在一个大学城里，几家书店，都附设有儿童读物部门。我们常带孩子去这些书店购买书籍，每次去时，顾客并不多。到北京的第二天，路过新华书店，看见里面有很多的孩子专心看书，这个情形——特别是与还在我们记忆中的美国情况对比——给我们一个很深刻的印象。
    美国孩子爱看“连环画”，内容大半是荒唐无稽和极端残酷的故事，文字既粗俗，又不合文法，使小孩子学了一些不伦不类的英文。
    除了连环画外，美国的孩子还喜欢看电视，据统计，学龄儿童每周消耗在电视上的时间，要在二十小时以上。电视节目和连环画的内容相似，以粗暴、残酷和曲解的冒险故事居多。近年不少儿童犯罪案件是受电视和连环画的影响的。有些孩子甚至承认，他们的犯罪行为，只不过是在电视或连环画上所看到的故事的重演。
    另一方面，美国对儿童读物，还有一些限制。例如侠盗罗宾汉的故事（与中国的某些劫富济贫的武侠小说相似），有些教育界负责人就主张不应当让小孩看，理由是这种故事的精神，与共产主义思想太相近了！
    归国观感
    我们回国主要的原因，是由于爱国主义的思想所驱使；另一方面，我们认为继续在那种社会环境里住下去，对不起我们的孩子。当然祖国这几年在共产党的领导下，国际地位的不断提高，对我们的回国决定，也有很大的影响。老实说，回国以前，对国内的情形知道得很少，对党和政府是半信半疑的。对党的信任是从我们踏进祖国大门第一步才开始的。
    我们亲眼看到祖国的实际情况，它比我们在美国时的最乐观的估计要好得很多。右派分子们说现在的生活水平低了，虽然我们不懂得政治，但是我们却看到了事实，当然从美国人的生活水平看，我们现在的确还低了些，但是比过去却高了不知多少。如果说共产党和政府不是为人民，那我们真不知道他们是为的什么。
    祖国这几年在教育工作和科学研究方面的进展，使我们感到惊异。无论在阵容、设备或实际工作方面，即使与战前极盛时代相比，都有天渊之别。即以物理方面为例，现在我们虽然还没有达到国际水平（事实上，短短的八年是不够奠定科学的基础的），不过就目前的情形看，已开始生根了。有人说党不能领导科学，我们的看法恰恰相反，这几年的成绩，已是一个很明确的证明。科学的发展，是应当配合国家的需要的，因此必需有通盘的计划，个别的科学家，往往是会片面的，着重在自己的部门，只有党才能从全面客观的观点出发，就国家的需要，统筹兼顾。
    过去听说在新社会里会议很多，我们常觉得不能理解为什么要费那么多时间在开会上，现在渐渐明了有些会议还是必需的。同时也认为科学工作者也有义务适当的参加一些社会工作。
    我们归国不久，认识很差，这次反右派斗争，对我们说可以算是一门很好的速成政治课，它使我们深深的感觉到有加强理论学习的必要。
