    Chinese Characters Should Be Reformed
    Tang Lan
    I have always maintained that Chinese characters have an excellent tradition, and Chinese characters should be reformed.
    Some people find it strange that if they have an excellent tradition, why should they be reformed. Actually, there is nothing strange about it. Everything is developing, especially the 600 million Chinese people who have been shackled in a society of class oppression for thousands of years and heavily oppressed by imperialist aggressors for nearly a hundred years, have been liberated under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. In the past eight years, we have basically achieved the victory of the socialist revolution. On this basis, we are carrying out large-scale socialist construction. All undertakings are developing unprecedentedly. Economic and cultural upsurges are surging in one after another. Then, can the writing tools, which occupy an important position in socialist construction, remain unchanged and stagnant?
    I say that Chinese characters have an excellent tradition and many advantages. I believe that the Chinese people should be proud of having such excellent characters in their motherland, but I firmly advocate that Chinese characters should be reformed. Chinese characters have been constantly developing for thousands of years, but only through reform can their development be accelerated and expanded, and can they keep pace with the development of socialist construction. Intellectuals can be compared to valuable assets of our country, but during the socialist revolution, intellectuals must transform themselves in order to pass the socialist test. Failure to move forward will result in falling behind.
    I say that Chinese characters have an excellent tradition precisely because they are constantly developing and can continue to develop. They have advantages, but also disadvantages. Some disadvantages are so serious that they cannot but be reformed. Even if they have many advantages, if they cannot adapt to all the great developments of the new society, the advantages can be transformed into disadvantages, and this makes reform even more necessary. Only through reform can they continue to develop, maintain and carry forward their excellent traditions.
    The new socialist culture includes all the excellent things from the past. We point out that Chinese characters have many advantages, hoping to preserve and carry forward these advantages as much as possible during the reform. I believe that if the reform of Chinese characters takes advantage of the situation and develops further on the existing basis, it will be easier. We point out its advantages, but certainly not to cover up its shortcomings, and even more so not to be used to oppose or hinder the reform of Chinese characters.
    I study Chinese characters, and I firmly advocate the reform of characters, but in the old society, I had no confidence. On the eve of liberation, in my "Introduction to Chinese Philology", I said about the issue of character reform: "We also know that what is reasonable may not be feasible, and what is commonly practiced may not be reasonable." After liberation, I firmly believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, any undertaking can be accomplished. What is commonly practiced will gradually become reasonable, and what is reasonable will surely be feasible. Under the education of the Party, my opinions on the methods and steps of character reform are constantly changing. Although sometimes I have different opinions from some comrades, and I insist on my own opinions in academic discussions, insisting does not mean unchanging. If someone else's opinion is more correct than mine, I will definitely correct my own mistakes. I am willing to see the reform of Chinese characters realized and steadily advanced under the leadership of the Party. I am a character reformer, and I am opposed to those who oppose reform. I firmly stand under the banner of character reform. Different opinions on academic matters can be discussed calmly, but the banner of character reform must be defended.
    I advocate that the reform of characters should take the direction of phoneticization. I definitely do not think that Chinese characters have reached a "dead end". I believe that unless people stop walking, there will never be no way to go; at most, it is just not knowing how to go and having "doubts" about "no way". I am against saying that Chinese characters are worthless, because this does not conform to the facts. But I firmly advocate opening up a broad road, not just to find
  “a new lease on life,” but for the sake of thousands upon thousands of emerging cities. It is not right to adopt a nihilistic attitude towards the national cultural heritage, but more importantly, we must look forward, look far ahead, and look at the big picture, that is to say: we must concentrate our efforts to accelerate and expand the development of Chinese characters, and we must take the socialist road.
    In the past, advocates of character reform often only emphasized the shortcomings of Chinese characters, such as being difficult to learn, difficult to write, and the difficulties in using them in modern technologies such as printing, typing, and telegraphing. I think that if we only one-sidedly emphasize the shortcomings without considering its advantages, it is not enough to convince people, and it is easy to cause resistance from some people and give opponents various excuses. I believe that the reform of characters should not only focus on the negative aspects, and it is not because Chinese characters are completely undesirable that they must be reformed. It should be affirmed that Chinese characters are basically good and can serve socialism, but in the highly developed socialist construction, they are bound to be insufficient. For example, new characters and new words such as "rivet" and "water pump" will continue to emerge in the future. Local dialects and foreign translated nouns make it difficult for Chinese characters to adapt to these new developments. Therefore, Chinese characters must be reformed, and Chinese characters must make unprecedented new developments and great developments. Chinese characters have had a major development in history, which was the emergence of phonetic characters from pictographic characters, which happened thousands of years ago. That major development saw the emergence of countless specialized vocabularies belonging to animal husbandry, planting, mining and metallurgy. Today's new situation urgently requires writing out new and large amounts of vocabulary, which requires Chinese characters to make new and huge developments, and another new script must emerge, namely phonetic script.
    That's right, on the one hand, I affirm that Chinese characters have an excellent tradition and many advantages, and on the other hand, I fully support Chairman Mao's instruction, "Characters must be reformed, and must take the common phonetic direction of world characters." Some people think it is contradictory, but I don't think it is contradictory at all. The ancient and beautiful city of Beijing will not prevent us from building it into a greater and more modern city. It will be the political, economic and cultural center of the country, and also an industrial city. In our lives, new developments are the main thing, and preserving and carrying forward the excellent traditions of national culture must also be done.
    I advocate that the reform of characters must take the phonetic direction, which is the direction of socialism. Chinese characters are still playing an active role in the current stage. While we are giving full play to its role, we can gradually develop phonetic script. There is such a precedent in the history of Chinese characters. The new qualities gradually expand, the old qualities gradually shrink, and a completely new script will be produced.
    Chinese characters have advantages, but some people use them to hold back the reform of characters, which I firmly oppose. We say: Although Chinese characters have many advantages, for the sake of their future, for the sake of great development, characters must be reformed and must take the phonetic direction.
    When our Party put forward the rectification movement in order to improve its work, right-wing ambitious elements wanted to stir up trouble and launch a major offensive. Class enemies are ubiquitous. Facts have proved that the sinister Zhang-Luo alliance had long intended to open a gap on the topic of character reform and attack the Party. The right-wing element Chen Mengjia was their vanguard. As early as January of this year, he wrote an "Elementary Discussion on Philology" for Guangming Daily, and at the same time introduced Han Hongwen (also a right-wing element), a reporter from Guangming Daily, to interview me, telling me many internal contradictions of the Character Reform Committee and provoking my relationship with "Chinese Language." Although I did not realize his intention at the time, because I was willing to argue with "Chinese Language" in a spirit of reconciliation, I did not agree with his use of provocative words such as "encirclement and suppression," and later he simply canceled this passage. In March, the Character Reform Committee invited me and Chen Mengjia to give lectures. I delayed doing so due to some reason. He was afraid of opposition from the masses and did not dare to give a public report, but during the period of great blooming and contending, he revealed his true colors. He completely negated the work of character reform, maliciously distorted it, and even asked the Character Reform Committee to withdraw the simplified character list and forced "Chinese Language" to publish a very absurd letter. At the symposium convened by the Character Reform Committee on May 16, he unscrupulously attacked the Party, and whispered with the right-wing reporter Liu Guanghua. After the meeting, he said to me, "Now the situation has changed. Don't keep talking about the phonetic direction. It's useless." At that time, I still didn't realize his ulterior motives, and only advised him, "Don't be so unscrupulous. This way of making suggestions is not good."
    After Chen Mengjia's article exaggerating the "encirclement and suppression" of me and the news of Han Hongwen's interview with me were published, I received a letter from a middle school in Guiyang forwarded by Guangming Daily, scolding the Party and the government on the issue of character reform, which was very reactionary. I understood from this incident that enemies would take advantage of loopholes everywhere, but I did not realize that right-wing elements like Chen Mengjia, wearing the cloak of scholars, were hidden between my elbows and armpits, stirring up trouble everywhere in my name. I was too numb.
    My pen talk published in People's Daily on April 18 had a lot of biased emotions in many places. Afterwards, with the education and help of the Party, and with the development of the situation, I gradually understood that even academic issues could be transformed into contradictions between ourselves and the enemy. Opposing the leadership of the Party is wrong. It was not until the conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo alliance was exposed that I truly opened my eyes and truly distinguished between ourselves and the enemy. I will never forget the help the Party gave me. In the future, I will continue to offer my opinions to the Party in the spirit of "knowing everything and saying everything," and at the same time, I must strengthen my own transformation, train myself, firm my position, and always wage a resolute struggle against right-wing elements.
    I always believe that the leadership of the Party is correct. Only under the leadership of the Party can character reform be carried out, and only by taking the phonetic direction can Chinese characters achieve unprecedented new development in history and become the new characters of socialist China. Let all comrades who support character reform unite under the leadership of the Party!

    中国文字应该改革
    唐兰
    我一向主张：中国文字具有优良传统，中国文字应该改革。
    有些人觉得奇怪，既然具有优良传统，为什么又要改革。其实不用奇怪。一切事物都在发展，尤其是几千年来束缚在阶级压迫的社会里，近百年来又被帝国主义侵略者重重压迫的六亿中国人民在中国共产党领导下获得解放，八年来，我们已经基本上获得社会主义革命的胜利，在这基础上正在进行大规模的社会主义建设，一切事业，正在空前发展，经济高潮和文化高潮一个接一个地滔滔涌进，那末，在社会主义建设中占重要地位的文字工具，能原封不动，裹足不前吗？
    我说中国文字具有优良传统，它有很多优点，我认为中国人民应该为祖国有这样优秀文字而自豪，但我坚决主张中国文字应该改革。中国文字几千年来是在不断发展的，但只有经过改革，才能加速并扩大它的发展，才能配合社会主义建设的发展。可以把知识分子作比喻，我们国家把知识分子当作宝贵的财产，但当社会主义革命时期，知识分子必须自我改造，才能过社会主义的关，不前进就会落后。
    我说中国文字具有优良传统，正因为它是不断发展的，是可以继续发展的。它有优点，但也有缺点，有些缺点很严重是不能不改革的。它即使有很多优点，如果不能适应新社会的一切巨大发展，优点也可以转化为缺点，这更是不能不改革的。只有进行改革，才能继续发展，才能保持并发扬它的优良传统。
    社会主义新文化是包括过去时代里一切优秀的东西的，我们指出中国文字有很多优点，希望进行改革时尽量保存并发扬这些优点。我认为中国文字改革，如果因利乘便，在原有的基础上进一步发展，将比较容易一些。我们指出它的优点，决不是用以掩盖它的缺点，更不允许用来反对或阻碍中国文字改革。
    我研究中国文字，我坚决主张文字改革，但在旧社会里，我是没有信心的。解放前夕，我写的中国文字学对文字改革问题，说过“我们也明知道，合理的未必能行得通，通行的未必合理”。解放以后，我坚决相信在中国共产党领导下，任何事业都可以完成。通行的逐渐会合理，合理的一定会行得通。在党的教育下，我对于文字改革的方法和步骤的意见，不断在改变，尽管有时候，我和有些同志有不同意见，在学术讨论中坚持自己的意见，但坚持不等于不变，如果别人的意见比我正确，我一定纠正自己的错误。我愿意看到中国文字改革在党的领导下早日实现，稳步前进。我是文字改革者，和反对改革的人们是对立的，我坚决地站在文字改革的旗帜下面。学术上不同意见可以从容讨论，文字改革的大旗，是必须保卫的。
    我主张文字改革要走拼音方向。我决不认为中国文字已到了“山穷水尽”。我认为除非人不走，决不会无路可走，至多是不知道怎样走而有“无路”之“疑”罢了。我反对把中国文字说得一文不值，因为这不符合事实。但我坚决主张要开辟出康庄大道，不单单是
  “柳暗花明又一村”，而为的是千千万万的新兴都市。对待民族文化遗产采取虚无主义态度是不应该的，但更重要的是我们必须向前看，向远处、大处看，那就是说：必须集中力量加速和扩大中国文字的发展，必须走社会主义道路。
    过去，文字改革的主张者，往往只强调汉字的缺点，难学、难写，以及印刷、打字、电报等现代技术上利用的困难。我认为如果只片面地调强缺点而不去估计它的优点，是不足以服人的，是容易造成某些人的抵触情绪而给反对者以种种借口的。我认为改革文字不应只着眼于消极方面，不是由于汉字完全要不得而必须改革。应该肯定汉字基本上是好的，是可以为社会主义服务的，但在社会主义建设的高度发展中，它必然不够用。例如“铆钉”、“水泵”之类的新字新词，以后将层出不穷。各地的方言土话，外来的翻译名词，都使得汉字很难适应这些新的发展。所以中国文字必须改革，中国文字必须作史无前例的新发展和大发展。中国文字历史上有过一次大发展，是从图画文字中出现了声符文字，那是几千年前的事情了。那一次大发展，出现了无数的专门的语汇是属于牧畜、种植、矿冶各方面的。今天的新的情势，迫切需要写出新的大量的语汇，就必需使中国文字作出新的巨大的发展，就必须出现另一种新文字，即拼音文字。
    就是这样，我一方面肯定中国文字具有优良传统，有很多优点，一方面完全拥护毛主席的指示，“文字必须改革，要走世界文字共同的拼音方向。”有人以为是矛盾，我认为一点不矛盾。古老的、美丽的北京城，一点也不会妨碍我们把它建设成为更伟大的新式的都市，它将是全国政治经济文化的中心，还将是一个工业都市。我们的生活里，新的发展是主要的，保存和发扬民族文化的优秀传统也是必须做的。
    我主张文字改革必须走拼音方向，这是社会主义的方向。汉字在现阶段里还在起积极作用，我们不妨在充分发挥它的作用的同时，逐渐发展拼音文字，在中国文字史上是有这样先例的，新生的质素逐渐扩大，旧的质素逐渐缩小，就会产生一种完全新的文字。
    汉字是有优点的，但有些人用以扯文字改革的后腿，我坚决反对。我们说：汉字尽管有很多优点，但为了它的前途，为了要大发展，文字必须改革，必须走拼音方向。
    我们党为了改进工作而提出整风的时候，右派野心家却要来兴风作浪大举进攻。阶级敌人是无孔不入的。事实证明，凶恶的章罗联盟早就蓄意在文字改革这个题目上打开缺口，向党进攻。右派分子陈梦家是他们的急先锋，早在今年1月，他为光明日报写了一篇“略论文字学”，同时介绍光明日报记者韩洪文（也是右派分子）来向我访问，给我讲了许多文字改革委员会的内部矛盾，挑拨我跟“中国语文”的关系。我当时虽未觉察他的企图，但由于我愿意与“中国语文”在和解精神的基础上进行争论，没有同意他用“围攻”等有刺激性的字眼，后来他索性把这一段取消了。3月间文字改革委员会邀我和陈梦家作讲演，我因故拖延未做，他害怕群众反对，还没有敢做公开报告，但到大鸣大放期间就原形毕露了。他把文字改革工作全面否定，恶毒歪曲，甚至要求文改会收回简化字表，并强迫“中国语文”刊登一封十分荒谬的来信。在5月16日文改会召集的座谈会上肆无忌惮地向党进攻，和右派记者刘光华交头接耳，会后对我说“现在形势变了，你不要尽说什么拼音方向，那是没有用的”。我当时也还没有觉察他的别有用心，只劝告他“不要这样肆无忌惮，这样提意见的方式是不好的”。
    在陈梦家渲染“围攻”我的文章和韩洪文访问我的新闻刊载后，我得到光明日报转来贵阳一个中学里的来信，借文字改革问题大骂党和政府，十分反动。我在这事件上懂得任何地方敌人都会钻空子，但我没有觉察到肘腋之间就隐藏着像陈梦家之类披着学者外衣的右派分子，到处借我为题来兴风作浪，我实在太麻痹了。
    4月18日在人民日报上发表的我的笔谈，很多地方是有偏激情绪的。尔后，得到党的教育和帮助，随着局势的发展，使我逐渐懂得尽管是学术问题，也可能转化为敌我矛盾。反对党的领导是错误的。一直到章罗联盟的阴谋暴露以后，我才更擦亮了眼睛，真正分清了敌我。党给我的帮助，我将终生不会忘记。我以后对党还本着“知无不言，言无不尽”的精神，提出自己的意见，同时，必须加强改造自己，锻炼自己，坚定立场，永远和右派分子作坚决的斗争。
    我始终相信党的领导是正确的，只有在党的领导下进行文字改革，走拼音方向，中国文字才能得到历史上从未有过的新发展，才能成为社会主义的中国新文字。让我们一切拥护文字改革的同志都在党的领导下团结起来吧！
