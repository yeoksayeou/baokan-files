Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, September 5th: The Pan-American Economic Conference, after nearly three weeks of meetings, closed on the 4th. No concrete results were achieved on several important agenda items.

The entire conference process showed that there are serious economic contradictions between the United States and Latin American countries. Because these contradictions could not be reconciled, the conference almost broke down several times. In their speeches, Latin American representatives particularly and fiercely criticized the discriminatory practices of the United States in commodity prices.

    经济矛盾无法调和
    美洲经济会议草草收场
    据新华社5日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：美洲国家经济会议在经过将近三个星期的会议后已经在4日闭幕。会议在几项重要的议程上没有达成具体结果。
    整个会议的过程表明，美国和拉丁美洲国家之间存在着严重的经济矛盾，由于这些矛盾的无法调和，会议有几次几乎中途停顿。拉丁美洲国家代表在发言中特别猛烈抨击美国在商品价格上的歧视作法。
