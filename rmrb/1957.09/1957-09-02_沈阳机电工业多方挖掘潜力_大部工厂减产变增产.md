    Shenyang Electromechanical Industry Explores Potential from Multiple Sources
    Most Factories Shift from Production Cuts to Production Increases
    (Our Newspaper News Report) Reporter Jin Yukun reports: Over the past seven months of deeply promoting the increase production and practice economy movement, the production situation in Shenyang's mechanical and electrical factories has undergone many changes. Due to actively exploring the potential of raw materials, the serious situation of insufficient raw material supply at the beginning of the year has passed. Most factories can not only smoothly complete this year's production plan, but also increase production in the second half of the year. The technical level of various factories has also improved.
    Saving Steel - More Than 8,000 Tons
    This year's production increase and thrift campaign in the Shenyang Electromechanical Industry system was carried out under the condition of serious shortage of raw materials. Many factories have made exploring the potential of raw materials one of the main contents of the movement. According to incomplete statistics, state-owned electromechanical factories and local state-owned factories saved a total of more than 8,500 tons of steel in seven months, which can be used to manufacture more than 3,400 eight-foot lathes. In five months, state-owned electromechanical factories saved metal materials worth 1.84 million yuan through improved design and improved technology. The Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant modified 110 parts on three machine tools, such as 1A62, saving 206 kilograms of metal per machine. The woodworking workshop of Shenyang Cable Factory improved the shape of wooden reels and adopted methods such as nesting, saving nearly 40,000 yuan of wood in the first half of the year, accounting for 30% of the total wood consumption in the first half of the year. Through this series of saving measures, the tense situation of raw material supply has been basically eased, and insufficient raw materials is no longer the main contradiction in the current production of these factories.
    Most Factories - Can Increase Production
    With the easing of the tight supply of raw materials, most electromechanical factories can, according to the needs of the country, change from the situation of reduced production at the beginning of the year due to insufficient raw materials to increased production. At present, many factories have formulated or are formulating production increase plans.
    Shenyang Water Pump Factory decided to increase production by 905 water pumps, accounting for 15% of the annual task. Shenyang Fan Factory plans to increase production by 592 fans. All three machine tool factories will increase production, with the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory alone increasing production by 500 machine tools. Many factories have included production increase tasks in their production plans since June. With the increase in production tasks, a new upsurge will be formed in the production of Shenyang's electromechanical industry.
    Trial Production of New Products - Transforming Old Products
    In this year's production increase and thrift campaign, the Shenyang Electromechanical Industry system paid special attention to the trial production of new products and the transformation of old products. Twelve mechanical factories plan to trial produce 94 new products this year, and 34 have been completed in the first half of the year. Most factories have overfulfilled the trial production tasks. Due to the continuous improvement of technical level, many factories have gradually reached the level of independent design and independent manufacturing. Shenyang Air Compressor Factory has completed the design and put into trial production a 640-horsepower high-pressure air compressor, and transformed a 190-horsepower air compressor. The transformed machine can not only save 600 kilograms of steel per unit, but also increase the exhaust volume per minute from 19 cubic meters to 21 cubic meters. The product performance exceeds the standards stipulated by the state. Five of the ten old products of Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory have been transformed. The transformed gas generator has improved its performance and reduced the cost by 14,000 yuan per unit.
    Undertaking Odd Jobs - Making Up for Deficiencies
    Some factories with insufficient production tasks, under the guidance of the idea of ​​running enterprises diligently and thriftily, actively contract various odd jobs to increase production. Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory is one of the factories with the most task reductions. After transferring a group of people to study, the tasks are still felt to be insufficient. They organized personnel to contract 1.04 million yuan of tasks from outside, accounting for about 10% of the total annual output value. Coupled with the task of increasing production, it can now basically meet the needs of personnel and equipment capacity. This year, the task of large-scale products of Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory has increased, and the capacity of large-scale equipment is seriously insufficient, but the capacity of small-scale equipment is greatly surplus. In order to overcome this imbalance in equipment, they recruited 150,000 man-hours of odd jobs from outside factories, which basically solved the problem of insufficient tasks for small equipment.
    The achievements of the production increase and thrift campaign in Shenyang's electromechanical factories are remarkable, but in the current situation of good production, some factories have relaxed their leadership in the production increase and thrift campaign, and some have not properly arranged the production increase and thrift campaign and the rectification movement. Therefore, how to make the drums of increasing production and practicing economy louder is still a problem worthy of attention.

    沈阳机电工业多方挖掘潜力
    大部工厂减产变增产
    本报讯  本报记者金雨困报道：沈阳市机械工厂和电机工厂深入开展增产节约运动七个多月来，生产情况已经起了很多变化。由于积极挖掘原材料的潜力，年初原材料供应不足的严重情况已经过去，大部分工厂不仅能够顺利完成今年的生产计划，而且还能在下半年增加生产。各个工厂的技术水平也有了提高。
    节约钢铁  八千多吨
    沈阳市机电工业系统今年的增产节约运动是在原材料严重不足的情况下进行的。许多工厂都把挖掘原材料潜力作为运动的主要内容之一。据不完全统计，国营机电工厂和地方国营工厂在七个月中，共节约钢铁八千五百多吨，这些钢铁可以用来制造八尺车床三千四百多台。国营机电工厂在五个月当中，通过改进设计和改进工艺就节约了价值一百八十四万元的金属材料。沈阳第一机床厂在1A62等三种机床上修改了一百一十种零件，每台节约金属二百零六公斤。沈阳电缆厂木工车间改进木盘形状和采用套裁等办法，上半年节约了将近四万元的木材，占上半年木材总用量的30％。通过这一系列节约措施，原材料供应紧张的局面基本上已经缓和下来，原材料不足已不是这些工厂当前生产中的主要矛盾了。
    大部工厂  可以增产
    随着原材料供应紧张情况的缓和，大部分机电工厂都可以根据国家的需要，由年初因原材料不足而减产的局面一变而为增产。目前，不少工厂都制定了或者正在制订增产计划。
    沈阳水泵厂决定增产九百零五台水泵，占全年任务15％。沈阳扇风机厂计划增产五百九十二台扇风机。三个机床厂都将增产，仅沈阳第三机床厂就要增产机床五百台。许多工厂从6月份开始就把增产任务列入了生产计划。随着生产任务的增加，沈阳机电工业生产中将形成一个新的高潮。
    试制新产品  改造老产品
    沈阳机电工业系统在今年的增产节约运动中，特别注意进行了新产品试制和老产品改造工作。十二个机械工厂今年计划试制九十四种新产品，今年上半年已经完成三十四种，大部分工厂超额完成了试制任务。由于技术水平不断提高，许多工厂已经逐步达到自行设计、自行制造的水平。沈阳空气压缩机厂已经设计完成并投入试制六百四十马力的高压空气压缩机，又改造了一百九十马力的空气压缩机，改造过的机器，不仅每台能节约六百公斤钢铁，而且每分钟排气量由十九立方公尺提高到二十一立方公尺，产品性能超过了国家规定的标准。沈阳矿山机器厂的十种老产品已经改造了五种，其中煤气发生炉改造后提高了性能，并使每台成本降低一万四千元。
    承揽杂活  弥补不足
    有些生产任务不足的工厂，在勤俭办企业的思想指导下，积极到外面承揽各种杂活来增加生产。沈阳第三机床厂是削减任务最多的一个厂，抽调一批人去学习以后，任务仍感不足。他们便组织人员到外面承揽了一百零四万元的任务，约占全年生产总值的10％，再加上增产任务，现在已经能基本上满足人员和设备能力的需要。沈阳矿山机器厂今年大型产品的任务增加，大型设备能力感到严重不足，但是小型设备的能力大为过剩。为了克服这一设备不平衡的现象，他们从外厂招揽了十五万工时的杂活，这样就基本上解决了小型设备任务不足的问题。
    沈阳市机电工厂增产节约运动的成绩是显著的，但是在目前生产情况较好的情况下，部分工厂放松了对增产节约运动的领导，有的没有将增产节约运动和整风运动进行妥善的安排。因此，如何把增产节约的锣鼓打得更响一些，还是一个值得重视的问题。
