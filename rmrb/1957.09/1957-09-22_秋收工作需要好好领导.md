Autumn harvest time has arrived. In some places, the autumn harvest has already begun. To strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year, the broad masses of peasants and rural cadres have put in tremendous effort. Now, all the autumn-ripening crops such as grain and cotton should be harvested.

The situation after agricultural cooperativization shows that there are some new issues in the autumn harvest that need to be addressed and resolved properly. Now we will express some opinions on these issues.

First of all, it is worth noting that some agricultural cooperatives lack labor; others lack animal power, with too few or weak livestock; and still others lack farm tools, unable to guarantee the complete and timely harvesting of all that should be harvested. This makes the ripe crops vulnerable to early frost, strong winds, or other natural disasters, or results in unclean harvesting, leading to reduced yields. Therefore, all localities should actively help those cooperatives lacking manpower or animal power to rationally organize and allocate manpower and animal power. When necessary, organize mutual support between cooperatives to overcome these difficulties, ensuring timely harvesting and preventing careless practices.

Local government offices, schools, and military units should, as far as possible, allocate manpower and animal power to support the local agricultural production cooperatives.

At the same time, some agricultural cooperatives have neglected ideological and political work, so that some members have not established collectivist thinking; the work point recording and other systems within the cooperatives are also not perfect enough, and the compensation is not reasonable enough. As a result, the enthusiasm of many members has been affected, and careless harvesting has occurred; some scatter grain everywhere, resulting in a lot of loss; others take advantage of picking up crops to turn many crops into their own; or deliberately let out domestic poultry and livestock to eat the cooperative's grain, and so on. All of these make it impossible to recover all the grain that should be recovered. In the autumn harvest last year, Xiangyanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Heishan County, Liaoning Province, wasted 220,000 jin of grain, an average loss of more than 130 jin of grain for each household. In the autumn harvest last year, Hexin Agricultural Cooperative in Nijiaxiang, Gong'an County, Hubei Province, lost 34,000 jin of rice, an average of 33 jin less per person. Therefore, it is necessary to advocate careful harvesting and strengthen ideological and organizational leadership in the autumn harvest.

In terms of ideological leadership, all localities must strengthen the collectivist and socialist education of cooperative members, so that all members can correctly understand their relationship with the cooperative, and thus cherish the cooperative's crops as they cherish their own. In this regard, the cooperatives should at any time commend model members who love the cooperative as their home, and organize everyone to learn from this good example. While strengthening education for cooperative members, they can also, according to the specific situation, formulate autumn harvest disciplines or autumn harvest covenants, and organize all cooperative members to jointly abide by and implement them. The formulation of autumn harvest disciplines and covenants is a new creation of agricultural cooperatives this year. Because it is in line with the interests of the broad masses of cooperative members, it can be fully implemented as long as the principles are explained clearly to the masses. Some cooperatives have unreasonable labor compensation, or other systems are unsound and have loopholes. They should actively find ways to improve and improve them, so that the labor enthusiasm of cooperative members can be fully exploited.

The harvests in various regions vary from good to poor, and attention should be paid to educating and organizing the masses to harvest carefully in both types of regions. According to past experience, areas with good harvests often think that "a little loss doesn't matter"; areas with poor harvests often think that "no matter how hard we work, we won't harvest much." These thoughts and emotions are very harmful. Areas with good harvests have the conditions to harvest more, so they should try to harvest as much as possible; areas with poor harvests, of course, should harvest more carefully, striving to increase part of the harvest and make the greatest effort to reduce the degree of disaster and reduce the state's grain supply to the region.

In terms of organizational leadership, the central goal is to achieve careful harvesting. According to local experience, as long as careful harvesting can be guaranteed, it is generally recognized that it is possible to harvest one more jin of seed cotton per mu of cotton field and five more jin of grain per mu of grain field. If all localities can do this, our country can harvest an additional 870,000 dan of seed cotton and 5 billion jin of grain. What a huge wealth this is! Specifically, for grain crops, it is necessary to harvest one piece at a time as it ripens, and ensure that every grain returns home. For rice, threshing machines should be vigorously promoted to improve efficiency. Indica rice is prone to shattering, so attention should be paid to cutting and placing it lightly, harvesting and threshing it as it is harvested, without delay. In case of rain, try to thresh it cleanly and dry it to prevent germination and mildew. The harvest of sweet potatoes should be guaranteed to be timely. Some cooperatives contract work and production to households, and harvest by households. Some cooperatives, in addition to keeping good seed potatoes, harvest and distribute them as they are harvested, and store them by households, slicing and drying them. These methods can be adopted, or other methods can be adopted, the purpose is to prevent mildew and loss. Cotton should be picked as it opens, picked carefully, and the tail flowers should be picked cleanly. Rotten flowers and frost-affected flowers should be harvested, ginned, stored, dried, and sold separately from good flowers. Peanuts should be harvested and picked up cleanly before the frost. In addition, autumn is an important season for collecting livestock feed. All localities should also pay attention to increasing the harvest of straw during the autumn harvest, and collect and store a large amount of wild grass.

On a national scale, the autumn harvest will last for one or two months; it cannot be completed all at once in one region. All localities should summarize and promote good experiences at any time, and improve as they harvest. Many regions used this method to improve the harvesting work in this year's summer harvest, and the results were very good. At present, in the tense season of autumn harvest, all localities must act quickly and make all preparations for the autumn harvest. The Yichang Prefectural Committee of Hubei Province recently found in its inspection of the autumn harvest preparation work in various counties that many township and cooperative cadres believed that a bumper rice harvest was a foregone conclusion, and that the agricultural cooperatives had promoted the contracting of work and production, so they felt that they could sit back and relax, and relaxed their autumn harvest preparation work. Twenty-three of the sixty cooperative cadres in Chenyuan Township, Dangyang County, left their autumn harvest preparation tasks and went to rest. This phenomenon may not only exist in Yichang Prefecture. All localities should check it carefully. Wherever there is such a situation, it should be corrected immediately.

### 秋收工作需要好好领导

    秋收工作需要好好领导
    秋收的时候到来了。有的地方秋收已经开始。为了争取今年农业丰收，广大农民群众和农村干部曾经付出极大的力量，现在就应该把粮食、棉花等秋熟作物全部收割回来。
    农业合作化以后的情况说明，秋收中有一些新的问题需要注意加以妥善解决。现在我们就这些问题发表一些意见。
    首先值得注意的是有一些农业社的劳动力不足；也有的是畜力不足，牲畜的数目太少或者瘦弱；还有的是农具不足，不能保证完全及时地把应当收割的都收割回来。这就使得已经成熟的庄稼容易遭受早霜、大风或其他自然灾害，或者收不干净，结果发生减收的现象。因此，各地应当积极帮助那些人力或者畜力不足的社合理地组织和调配人力畜力，必要时组织各社互相支援，使这方面的困难能够大体克服，保证及时收打，并且不致发生粗放现象。
    各地的机关、学校和部队，应当尽可能抽调人力畜力支援当地的农业生产合作社。
    同时，有一些农业合作社忽略了思想政治工作，以致一部分社员没有树立起集体主义思想；社内记工记分和其他制度也不够完善，报酬不够合理，结果就影响了许多社员的积极性，发生收割粗放的现象；有的随地抛撒，损失很多；还有的借着拾庄稼为名而把许多庄稼变成了自己的；或者是故意放出家禽家畜去吃社里的粮食等等。所有这些，都使得一部分应该收回来的谷物不能尽数收回。辽宁省黑山县向阳红农业合作社去年秋收中糟踏粮食二十二万斤，平均每户少了一百三十多斤粮食的收益。湖北公安县倪家乡合新农业社去年秋收中损失稻谷三万四千斤，平均每人少分三十三斤。因此，必须提倡精收细打，加强秋收的思想领导和组织领导。
    在思想领导方面，各地必须加强对社员的集体主义、社会主义教育，使所有的社员都能正确了解他们和社的关系，从而像爱护自己的庄稼一样爱护社的庄稼。在这方面，各社应当随时表扬爱社如家的模范社员，并且组织大家学习这种好的榜样。在对社员加强教育的同时，还可以根据具体情况，制定秋收纪律或秋收公约，并且组织所有社员共同遵守，贯彻执行。制定秋收纪律和公约是今年农业社创造的新作法。由于它符合于广大社员群众的利益，所以只要向群众说清楚道理，就完全能够实行。有的社劳动报酬不尽合理，或者其他制度不健全，有漏洞，应当积极想办法改善和健全起来，使社员的劳动积极性能够充分发挥出来。
    各地的年景有丰有歉，对这两种地区都应该注意教育和组织群众精收细打。根据过去情况，丰收的地区常常以为“损失点不要紧”；歉收的地区又往往认为“不管怎么干也收不了多少了”。这些思想情绪都是非常有害的。丰收的地区有多收的条件，就应该尽量争取多收；歉收的地区，当然更应该精收细打，争取增加一部分收获量，尽最大努力缩小灾歉程度，减轻国家对本地区的粮食供应。
    在组织领导方面，中心目标是要做到精收细打。根据各地经验，只要能够保证精收细打，每亩棉田多收一斤籽棉、每亩粮田多收五斤粮食是公认为可能的。如果各地都能这样作到，我们国家就可以多收籽棉八十七万担，粮食五十亿斤。这是多么巨大的一笔财富呀！具体来说，对于谷类作物，要做到熟一块收一块，并且保证颗粒还家。水稻要大力推广打谷机，以提高效率。籼稻容易落粒，应注意轻割轻放，随收随打，不能耽搁，遇雨要设法打净弄干，防止发芽霉烂。甘薯的收获，要保证适时，有些社分户包工包产，分户收获，有些社除了留好种薯以外，随收随分，分户贮藏，切片晒干。这些办法都可以采用，也可以采取其他办法，目的是要防止霉烂和损失。棉花要随开随收，细细收摘，收净尾花。烂花、霜后花要与好花分收、分轧、分存、分晒、分卖。花生应当在霜前收净、拾净。另外，秋季是收集牲畜饲料的重要季节，各地在秋收中还应当注意提高秸秆的收获量，并且大量收贮野草。
    就全国范围说，秋收要持续一两个月；在一个地区也不是一下子就能收完。各地应该随时总结和推广好的经验，边收边改。不少地区在今年夏收中用这种办法改进收获工作，收效很好。目前在秋收的紧张季节里，各地必须很快行动起来，作好秋收的一切准备工作。湖北宜昌地委最近在检查各县秋收准备工作中发现，许多乡社干部都认为水稻丰收已成定局，农业合作社又推行了包工包产，因而觉得可以高枕无忧，对秋收准备工作也就放松了。当阳县陈院乡的六十个社干部有二十三个丢下秋收准备任务，休息去了。这种现象也许还不只是宜昌专区一个地方有，各地方都应该好好检查一下，哪里有这种情形就应当马上纠正。
