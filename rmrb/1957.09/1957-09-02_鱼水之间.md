    Between Fish and Water
    By Our Correspondent Yu Yaofu
    During the National Conference of Activists of Trade Unions, I interviewed Comrade Tong Suqun, Director of Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, about some issues between the factory director and the trade union. He began by saying, "We deeply feel that the relationship between the administration and the trade union is like that between fish and water. Any work done by the trade union is a support to the administration. To run a socialist enterprise well, we must rely on the working class's own organization—the trade union. Supporting the trade union is supporting ourselves. It is impossible to run the enterprise well by relying solely on administrative orders."
    Starting with "Drawing Portraits of Everyone"
    Tong Suqun said: We did not clearly understand the role of the trade union from the beginning. In the early years after liberation, some comrades did not pay attention to mass work, saying that the trade union "only draws portraits of everyone (referring to blackboard newspapers) and engages in criticism." These muddled ideas were gradually broken by the trade union's extensive practical activities.
    In 1951, when we started to prepare the production, technology, and finance plan, all the workshops did not pay attention to it. After dragging on for more than a month, they still could not submit it, and the factory director was very anxious. At this time, the trade union analyzed the situation of each workshop and found that most of the cadres in each section and workshop were intellectuals. They were not good at consulting with the masses and just sat in the office doing calculations and filling out forms; at the same time, some of them looked down on cadres from worker backgrounds. The trade union seized this characteristic, sent people to help the director of the worker-background timber workshop to come up with a plan first, published it on the propaganda corridor, and called on everyone to compete; and used oral broadcasting to shout every day, "The plan of a certain workshop has been set up, why hasn't a certain workshop been set up yet?" These encouraging efforts motivated everyone and they went out of the office one after another to consult with experienced veteran workers. In just seven days, each workshop had set up a preliminary plan. The administrative cadres were very satisfied and said, "Compiling a plan, compiling a plan, we couldn't compile it for a month or two. With the trade union's call, it came out in just seven days."
    In 1956, the steelmaking workshop promoted the oxygen steelmaking method, and the oxygen consumption suddenly increased. Each workshop asked the chief engineer to supply more oxygen every day. It was too late to buy it from other places. What should we do? Chief Engineer Xiong Qingsheng raised this question at the meeting and asked everyone to think of a solution. The leading cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League could not come up with a solution. At this time, the trade union convened experienced welders from each workshop to hold a production meeting. After discussion, everyone found seven ways. The next day at work, the veteran workers led everyone to implement them. As a result, the new steelmaking method was successfully promoted, and the oxygen shortage problem in each workshop was solved. The chief engineer said happily, "The wisdom of the masses is truly infinite."
    Tong Suqun said that the trade union uses the method of mass work to open up the masses' minds, give play to the masses' enthusiasm and creativity, and turn the administration's intentions into the masses' conscious actions. The work of the trade union and the administration complements each other, and neither can replace the other. How can we say that the trade union "only draws portraits of everyone and engages in criticism"?
    Tong Suqun said that the administration should also support the trade union and create conditions for the trade union to mobilize the masses. For example, when launching a competition, the administration should put forward indicators, explain the key points, and take corresponding technical measures. During the competition, the administration should also provide timely information for summarizing and evaluating, and make a summary of the competition. In this way, the trade union can be exempted from a lot of repetitive labor and put its main energy into mobilizing the masses to achieve the conditions for the competition. Now this practice has become a habit in our factory, and no one feels that the competition is an "extra burden."
    Section Chief Yang No Longer Hides at His Mother-in-Law's House
    Tong Suqun said: Some administrative cadres in our factory once had the illusion that "strengthening mass supervision would restrain their hands and feet." This illusion has also been corrected by many works done by the trade union.
    In 1956, the factory built a thousand new dormitories for employees. More than two hundred of them were very humid, and the walls were moldy. The masses had a lot of opinions and asked to lay floors. Without money or materials, Section Chief Yang of the real estate management section was so worried that he wanted to hide at his mother-in-law's house. At this time, the trade union conducted a detailed investigation and found out that only more than two hundred rooms were particularly humid; it also learned that the administration still had more than 80,000 yuan for repairing sewers that had not been used; the factory had a batch of waste wood that could be used to lay the floors of this part of the house. Therefore, the trade union proposed a plan: launch voluntary labor to repair sewers and save money to repair floors. The administration and the Party committee both approved the plan. At the employee representative conference, the proposal was discussed and approved by everyone. The next day after the meeting, the factory director, the Party committee secretary, and the trade union chairman personally started to repair the sewer. All the employees came upon hearing the news, and everyone worked together. In less than ten days, the sewer was repaired, and the problem of humidity in the house was completely solved.
    Tong Suqun said that many similar problems have also been solved very well, such as the transfer of workers in the freight car workshop, the revision of the factory's reward system, the charges for the boiler room and bathhouse in the workers' residential area, and the expansion of the nursery, etc. He said that we have learned from dealing with these problems that people's activities are multifaceted. In addition to eight hours of production and work, there are also study, entertainment, social life, and family life. Administrative leaders generally pay more attention to how to organize production and complete national plans; they often easily relax on improving labor conditions and improving employees' daily lives. Even if they consider it, they focus on collective and large issues, but not pay much attention to individual and small requirements of the masses. Implementing the mass supervision system can raise these problems in time, plug the loopholes, and prevent the growth of bureaucracy. This kind of supervision depends on the trade union to carry out daily organization work. In the past, some people understood the administrative's comprehensive care for the lives of employees as "the administration pays, the trade union comes forward" and "the administration supports the trade union." This view is completely wrong.

    鱼水之间
    本报记者  于药夫
    在全国工会积极分子代表会议期间，记者访问了戚墅堰机车车辆工厂厂长童苏群同志，谈到厂长同工会之间的一些问题。他开头就说：“我们深刻感觉到：行政与工会的关系，就像鱼同水的关系。工会所做的任何一件工作，都是对行政的支持。要想办好一个社会主义企业，必须依靠工人阶级自己的组织——工会。支持工会就是支持自己，要想单靠行政命令办好企业，是不可能的。”
    从“画人人头”谈起
    童苏群说：我们对工会的作用并不是一开始就明确的。刚解放那几年，有些同志不重视群众工作，说工会“只会画人人头（指黑板报），搞批评”。这些糊涂观念，被工会大量的实际活动逐步打破了。
    1951年，我们着手编制生产技术财务计划，各车间都不重视，拖了一个多月还交不出来，厂长十分焦急。这时，工会分析了各车间的情况，发现各科室和各车间干部绝大部分是知识分子，他们不善于同群众商量，只坐在办公室里打算盘，填表格；同时，他们当中有一些人还看不起工人出身的干部。工会抓住这个特点，派人帮助工人出身的制材车间主任先搞出了一个计划，在宣传廊上公布出来，号召大家竞赛；又利用口头广播，天天大叫“某某车间的计划订出来了，某某车间为什么还没有呢？”这些鼓动工作把大家都推动了起来，纷纷走出办公室，找有经验的老工人商量。前后只用了七天工夫，各车间都把初步计划订好了。行政干部非常满意，都说：“编计划，编计划，编了一两个月编不出来。工会一叫，才七天就出来了。”
    1956年，炼钢车间推行加氧炼钢法，氧气消耗量突然增加，各车间天天向总工程师要求多供应氧气。到外地去买吧，一时来不及。怎么办呢？总工程师熊清生在会上提出这个问题，要求大家想办法。党、行政、工会、青年团的领导干部，谁也拿不出办法来。这时，工会便召集各车间有经验的风焊工来开生产会议，大家一讨论，找到了七条办法。第二天一上班，老工人们就领导着大家执行。结果，新炼钢法顺利地推行了，各车间缺氧的问题都解决了。总工程师高兴地说：“群众的智慧真是无穷。”
    童苏群说，工会就是这样运用群众工作的方法，打通群众的思想，发挥群众的积极性和创造性，把行政的意图变成群众自觉的行动。工会和行政的工作相辅相成，谁也不能代替谁。那能说工会“只会画人人头，搞批评”呢？
    童苏群说，行政方面也应该支持工会，给工会发动群众创造条件。例如，在发动竞赛的时候，行政上要提出指标，交代关键，采取相应的技术措施。在竞赛过程中，行政又要及时提供总结评比的资料，作出竞赛总结。这样做，就可以使工会免除许多重复劳动，把主要精力放到发动群众实现竞赛条件上去。现在这种做法在我们厂里已经成了习惯，谁也不感到竞赛是“额外负担”。
    杨科长不再躲到丈母家去了
    童苏群说：我们厂有些行政干部还曾有过“加强了群众监督，束缚了自己的手脚”的错觉。这种错觉也被工会所做的许多工作纠正过来了。
    1956年，工厂新建了一千户职工宿舍。其中有二百多户非常潮湿，墙壁都发了霉，群众意见很多，纷纷要求铺地板。一没有钱，二没有料，房产管理科的杨科长愁得要躲到丈母家去住。这时，工会进行了详细调查，弄清楚了特别潮湿的只有二百多间；又了解到行政上还有修下水道的八万多元钱没有动用；本厂有一批废木料，可以够铺这一部分房子的地板。于是，工会就提出了一个方案：发起义务劳动修下水道，省出钱来修地板。行政和党委都赞成这个方案。在职工代表大会上，这个提案被大家讨论通过了。会后第二天，厂长、党委书记和工会主席都亲自下手去修理下水道。全体职工闻风而至，大家一齐动手，不到十天，便把下水道修好了，房子潮湿的问题也得到了完满的解决。
    童苏群说，类似这样的问题还解决了许多，像货车车间调动工人、修改全厂奖励制度、工人住宅区的开水站和澡塘收费以及扩大托儿所等等，都解决得很好。他说，我们从处理这些问题中体会到：人的活动是多方面的，除了八小时生产和工作之外，还有学习、娱乐、社会生活和家庭生活。行政领导干部一般的比较偏重于考虑如何组织生产，完成国家计划；对于改善劳动条件，改善职工日常生活往往容易放松。即使考虑了，也着重集体的大的问题，而不大注意群众中个别的小的要求。实行群众监督制度，就可以及时把这些问题提出来，把漏洞堵住，防止官僚主义滋长。而这种监督，正要靠工会来进行日常的组织工作。过去有些人把行政上全面关心职工生活理解为“行政出钱，工会出面”“行政捧工会的场”。这种看法是完全不对的。
