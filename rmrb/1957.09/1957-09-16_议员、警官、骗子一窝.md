American Underworld

    Recently, some newspapers in New York published a small social news item in the back pages about a man who committed suicide by jumping off a building. This is commonplace in capitalist society. However, later revelations show it was actually a shocking international fraud case. The victim was a French businessman named Frank Duren. He was not only swindled out of his fortune but also lost his life.

    Duren arrived in New York from France and stayed at the famous Empire State Building, preparing to do some business with his millions of dollars. His lavish spending attracted the attention of swindlers. Soon, some flamboyant American businessmen approached Duren and gained his trust. One day, they invited Duren to participate in the formation of a stock company. Another day, they persuaded him to jointly take over a well-known television company. Duren was convinced and invested all of his 16 million dollars. From then on, his "friends" suddenly disappeared.

    A month later, Duren discovered that he had been deceived and hurriedly reported the crime to the police. After a few days, two police officers told him not to pursue the matter, and that if he wanted to avoid trouble, he should leave the United States quickly. Duren later learned from other sources that the money he had been swindled out of had been divided up: the swindlers took 40%; a certain congressman took 20%; police officers took 30%; and the remaining amount was used to cover the expenses of setting up the scam for four months. Duren was furious when he learned this and said he would file a lawsuit in Washington. On the eve of his departure for Washington, someone saw him being taken into the tax administration building by two police officers and three plainclothes men. There, Duren "committed suicide by jumping off a building."

    The enthusiasm of the Hungarian people in building their motherland is extremely high, and even children are doing their part. This is a picture of children in Budapest collecting scrap iron for the country.

    议员、警官、骗子一窝
    最近，纽约某些报纸在背栏里发表了一条很小的社会新闻，有一人跳楼自杀。这在资本主义社会里本是家常便饭。可是据后来的透露，实际上却是一件骇人听闻的国际大骗案。被骗者是一个法国富商，名叫法兰克·杜伦。他不但被骗的囊空如洗，而且连命也送了。
    杜伦从法国到达纽约，下榻著名的帝国大厦，准备以他的千万家产，作些生意。他的豪阔引起了骗徒的注意。不久，有一些排场很大的美国商人同杜伦接近起来，并取得了杜伦的信任。一天，他们拉杜伦参加筹组一个股票公司。又一天，他们又劝他合伙承受一家著名电视公司。杜伦深信不疑，将所有的一千六百万美元倾囊以赴。从此，他的一帮“朋友”忽然都不见了。
    一个月之后，杜伦发现受骗，急忙报警。过了几天，有两位警官告诉他不必追查，而且他若要避免麻烦，最好迅速离开美国。杜伦后来从其他方面得知：原来他被骗的钱已被分赃：骗徒占去十分之四；某议员占去十分之二；警官占去十分之三；余下的开销了四个月来布置骗局的费用。杜伦得知后甚为愤怒，表示要到华盛顿起诉。就在他要往华盛顿去的前夕，有人见到他被两名警官和三个便衣大汉带入税政大厦，就在那里，杜伦“跳楼自杀”了。
