Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 26th Dispatch: According to TASS, in view of the smooth implementation of the new Five-Year Plan, and because the restructuring of industrial and construction management makes it possible to make fuller use of the country's rich resources and production potential. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union decided to start formulating a long-term plan for the development of the national economy from 1959 to 1965. It is stipulated that the drafting of this plan should be completed on July 1, 1958.

The CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union believe that the situation in the period since the 20th Congress of the CPSU shows that the instructions of the Congress on the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) are being successfully implemented. In 1956, the total industrial output increased by almost 11% compared with 1955; in the first eight months of 1957, it increased by more than 10% compared with the same period last year. The 12th Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee in December 1956 instructed that certain tasks proposed in the Five-Year Plan instructions should be specified in detail in order to ensure the most rational and effective use of materials and funds used to develop the national economy, and to tap the potential to allocate more funds for housing construction. According to this decision, the five-year plan for housing construction will be overfulfilled.

According to the resolutions of the February 1957 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee and the May 1957 session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the work of reorganizing the management of industry and construction was carried out according to the principle of regions, and the National Economic Committees of the Economic Administrative Regions were established. This requires a fundamental change in the system of long-term planning and current planning. The new system of planning by economic administrative regions, which is implemented to adapt to the new management system, makes it possible to make fuller use of the Soviet Union's rich resources, ensure more correct allocation of production, and solve some important tasks in opening up and developing many new industrial sectors and in comprehensively developing various economic zones.

In addition, in recent years, geologists have newly discovered large deposits of various raw materials and power resources. On the basis of these resources, it is possible to establish new enterprises and new industrial centers that are not stipulated in the instructions of the new Five-Year Plan. It is not enough to complete this task in the remaining three years of the new Five-Year Plan alone. It will take at least five to seven years to complete this major task.

In view of the above situation, the CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union believe that it is necessary to prepare a longer-term plan for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union, and instructed the Soviet State Planning Committee, the Council of Ministers of each Union Republic, the National Economic Committees of the Soviet Union, and various ministries and competent authorities to formulate a draft plan for the development of the national economy from 1959 to 1965.

The CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union believe that the following main tasks must be taken as the basis when preparing the draft long-term plan: ensuring the further vigorous development of all sectors of the national economy on the basis of giving priority to the development of the production of the means of production, so as to solve the basic economic task of the Soviet Union—to take a big step forward in catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita output in the shortest historical period; and ensuring the further improvement of the material and cultural life of the Soviet people on the basis of the growth of national social wealth.

Since striving to improve labor productivity is the most important condition for realizing the main tasks of the long-term plan, the new long-term plan should open up broad activity places for the development of all scientific departments, theoretical research, and new great scientific inventions.

In the draft long-term plan, it is necessary to stipulate a larger scale of development of the natural resources of the eastern regions of the Soviet Union, the rapid development of the ferrous and non-ferrous metal smelting industry, the chemical industry, especially the production of man-made fibers, food raw material substitutes, plastics, other synthetic materials, and artificial leather, it is necessary to stipulate the high-speed development of national electrification, the further development of the coal industry, especially the oil and gas industry, it is necessary to shorten the construction period, eliminate the phenomenon of numerous construction projects and dispersed funds, and greatly expand the scale and speed of housing construction, it is necessary to expand the production of agricultural products so as to catch up with the United States in terms of per capita meat, oil and milk production in the next few years, and greatly increase the output of other consumer goods.

    充分利用丰富资源　适应新的发展任务
    苏联着手制定长期经济计划
    在最短期内使生产超过最发达的资本主义国家
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：鉴于新五年计划的顺利执行以及由于工业和建设管理工作的改组使得有可能更加充分地利用国家丰富的资源和生产潜力，苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议决定着手制定1959—1965年发展国民经济长期计划。这个计划草案的制定工作规定在1958年7月1日完成。
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议认为，苏共第二十次代表大会以后这段时期的情况表明，这次代表大会关于第六个五年计划（1956—1960年）的指示正在顺利地执行中。1956年工业总产量比1955年几乎增长了11％；1957年头八个月又比去年同期增长了10％以上。1956年苏共中央12月全会曾经作出指示，规定要把五年计划指示中提出的某些任务作详细的规定，以便保证对用来发展国民经济的物资和资金作最合理的和最有效的利用，以便挖掘潜力给住宅建设拨更多的资金。按照这个决定，住宅建设的五年计划将超额完成。
    根据1957年苏共中央2月全会和同年5月苏联最高苏维埃会议的决议，按地区原则进行了改组管理工业和建设的工作，成立了经济行政区国民经济委员会，这就要求根本改变长期计划和现在计划的计划工作的制度。而适应新的管理制度而实行的按各经济行政区进行计划工作的新制度，使得有可能更充分地利用苏联丰富的资源，保证更正确地配置生产，解决在开辟和发展许多新的工业部门方面以及在全面发展各个经济区方面的一些重要任务。
    此外，在最近几年中，地质学家新发现了各种各样的原料和动力资源的大产地。在这类资源的基础上，有可能建立新五年计划指示中所没有规定的新的企业和新的工业中心。要完成这项工作，单是新五年计划余下的三年时间是不够的。实现这个重大的任务至少需要五年到七年的时间。
    鉴于以上情况，苏共中央和苏联部长会议认为，必须要编制更长时期的苏联发展国民经济的长期计划，并且责成苏联国家计划委员会、各加盟共和国部长会议、苏联各国民经济委员会、各部和各主管机关制定1959—1965年发展国民经济计划草案。
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议认为，在编制长期计划草案时必须以下列主要任务为根据，这就是：在优先发展生产资料生产的基础上保证进一步大力发展国民经济的各个部门，以便在解决苏联的基本经济任务——在最短的历史时期内在按人口计算的产量方面赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家方面再向前迈进一大步；在国家社会财富增长的基础上，保证苏联人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平有进一步提高。
    由于尽力来提高劳动生产率是实现长期计划的主要任务的最重要条件，新的长期计划应当为发展一切科学部门、理论研究和新的巨大的科学发明开拓广阔的活动场所。
    在长期计划草案中，必须规定更大规模地开发苏联东部地区的自然资源，迅速地发展黑色和有色金属冶炼业、化学工业特别是人造纤维、食品原料代用品、塑胶、其他合成材料以及人造皮革的生产，必须规定高速度发展全国电气化，进一步发展煤炭工业特别是石油和煤气工业，必须缩短建筑期限，消灭施工项目繁多、资金分散的现象，并且大大扩大住宅建设的规模和速度，必须扩大农产品生产以便在最近几年内在肉类、油类和牛奶产量方面按人口计算赶上美国，并且大大地增加其他消费品的产量。
