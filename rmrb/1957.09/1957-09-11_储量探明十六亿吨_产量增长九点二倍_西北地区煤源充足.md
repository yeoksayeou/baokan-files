Northwest China has abundant coal resources, with proven reserves reaching 1.6 billion tons and production increasing 9.2-fold.

(Our correspondent, Li Qian, reports from Xi'an on the 10th) During the First Five-Year Plan, the coal industry construction in Northwest China achieved brilliant success.

As vanguards in coal industry construction, the coalfield geological exploration teams have traversed hundreds of thousands of square kilometers in the four regions of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia over the past five years. They have unveiled the secrets of the "Weibei Coalfield," which spans hundreds of square kilometers from Baishui and Hancheng in the east to Longxian in the west, and from Shenmu and Fugu in the north, with reserves of 50 billion tons. They have also basically grasped the coal seam storage conditions in the Qilian Mountains, Helan Mountains, Hexi Corridor, and Qinling Mountains. To date, they have provided the state with resource data for reserves totaling over 1.697 billion tons, exceeding the First Five-Year Plan by 70%. They have formally submitted to the state detailed survey data for new coalfield projects with reserves of over 970 million tons, sufficient to construct twelve pairs of modern vertical shafts with an annual production capacity of 1.2 million tons. In addition, they have submitted a detailed survey report on oil shale deposits with reserves of over 44.4 million tons, sufficient to build an oil refinery with an annual production capacity of 30,000 tons.

Striking progress has also been made in coal mine construction. At the time of liberation, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces only had nine small coal kilns with very backward production conditions, with an annual output of just over 160,000 tons. At that time, even civilian coal had to be transported from thousands of miles away. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the state carried out large-scale coal mine capital construction in Northwest China. On the rich Weibei Coalfield, eight pairs of mines and adits have been newly built and rebuilt, with Tongchuan as the base. Among them, the newly built Sanlidong vertical shaft with an annual production capacity of 600,000 tons was officially put into production on July 1 this year. The Wangshi’ao vertical shaft, designed with Soviet assistance with an annual production capacity of 1.2 million tons, will also begin construction at the end of this year. In the Gansu region, the Aganzhen Coal Mine has been transformed from a mine with an annual production capacity of 120,000 tons to one with 750,000 tons, and the Shmengou Coal Mine has been transformed from one with an annual production capacity of 200,000 tons to one with 600,000 tons. In the newly developed Shandan Coalfield, three pairs of mines are under construction, with a total annual production capacity of 700,000 tons. A mine with an annual production capacity of 300,000 tons has also begun construction in Shizuishan. It is estimated that by the end of this year, a total of fifteen pairs of newly built and rebuilt mines and adits will be completed, with a total designed capacity of 6.56 million tons, exceeding this year's plan by 9.3%. In the newly built and rebuilt mines, all processes except coal loading are mechanized.

With the completion of the newly built and rebuilt coal mines, the backward state of coal production in Northwest China has been significantly improved. In 1952, the output of state-owned coal mines in Northwest China was only 486,000 tons. By 1956, it had reached 1.2 million tons. This year, the estimated output is 1.54 million tons, more than double that of 1952 and 9.2 times more than in the early days of liberation.

### 储量探明十六亿吨　产量增长九点二倍　西北地区煤源充足

　　储量探明十六亿吨　产量增长九点二倍
　　西北地区煤源充足
    本报西安10日电　记者李茜报道：在第一个五年计划期间，西北地区的煤炭工业建设获得了辉煌的成就。
    作为煤炭工业建设尖兵的煤田地质勘探工作队，五年来走遍了陕西、甘肃、青海、宁夏四个地区数十万平方公里的地方，揭开了东起白水、韩城，西至陇县，北到神木、府谷，方圆数百平方公里、储量达五百亿吨的“渭北煤田”的秘密，并且基本上掌握了祁连山、贺兰山、河西走廊以及秦岭山区的煤层贮存情况。到目前为止，他们已经给国家提供了储量达十六亿九千七百多万吨资源资料，超额70％完成第一个五年计划。他们向国家正式提交的新建煤田项目精查储量有九亿七千多万吨，可以建设年产一百二十万吨的现代化竖井十二对。另外，他们还提交了储量达四千四百多万吨油母页岩矿精查报告一件，可以建设年产量三万吨的炼油厂。
    煤矿建设事业也有了惊人进展。解放时，陕西、甘肃两省仅仅接收了九个生产条件非常落后的小煤窑，年产量才有十六万多吨。当时，连民用煤也要大部分由几千里地以外运来。在第一个五年计划期间，国家在西北地区进行了大规模的煤矿基本建设。在富饶的渭北煤田上，已经以铜川为基地新建和改建了八对矿井和平峒。其中新建的年产六十万吨的三里洞竖井已于今年7月1日正式投入生产。苏联帮助设计的年产煤一百二十万吨的王石凹竖井，也将在今年年底开工兴建。在甘肃地区，阿干镇煤矿已由年产量十二万吨改建成七十五万吨的矿井，石门沟煤矿已由年产二十万吨改建成六十万吨。新开发的山丹煤田，正在建设三对矿井，总共年产量为七十万吨。在石咀山也有一个年产三十万吨的矿井开始建设了。预计今年年底，新建改建矿井和平峒共达十五对，总设计能力达六百五十六万吨，可以超额9.3％完成今年计划。在新建和改建的矿井中，除装煤外，全部用机械。
    随着新建、改建煤矿的建成，西北煤炭生产的落后面貌已经有显著的改善。1952年，西北地区国营煤矿产量仅有四十八万六千吨，到1956年，即达一百二十万吨，今年预计产量为一百五十四万吨，比1952年增加二倍多，较解放初期增加九点二倍。
