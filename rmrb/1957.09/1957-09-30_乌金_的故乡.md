The Hometown of "Black Gold"
Gu Ye, Gao Feng

People know that Shanxi is China's "home of coal and iron." But exactly how much coal lies underground has long been a mystery. Before liberation, there was almost no serious drilling and exploration anywhere. After liberation, the Ministry of Coal Industry established the North China Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau in Shanxi, and more than seven thousand drilling personnel traversed the crisscrossing mountains and fields. After more than three years of efforts, they have put forward a relatively close to actual figure: the total coal reserves in Shanxi Province are about 400 billion tons. This figure is 50 billion tons more than the estimated total coal reserves of China at the International Geological Conference held in 1937; it accounts for two-thirds of the currently known coal reserves in the country; and at the current production level of Shanxi coal mines, it can supply us for tens of thousands of years.

Among the 100 counties and cities in Shanxi Province, 88 have coal underground. These coals are generally formed evenly over large areas, close to the surface, with gentle and stable coal seams, and few faults, which is very convenient for mining. Shanxi also has a complete range of coal types, including rich coking coal, coal for general industrial power, coal needed for oil refining and the chemical industry, and more than ten kinds of coal, including a large amount of civil coal. Shanxi is indeed the well-deserved hometown of "black gold" in the motherland.

People recall the scenes of the mining areas in the past, and their hearts are filled with terror and hatred. Before liberation, there was a saying: "Only when there is no way out, do you go down the kiln." This is a true reflection of the tragic life of miners. At that time, the exploiters forced the miners to go to the unsafe mines with clubs and guns every day. In the humid, dark, and suffocating tunnels, the workers drained water with baskets. If the accumulated water could not be drained, they worked while soaking in the water. They also had to strip naked in places full of coal dust and slag, and dig coal by hand for more than ten hours a day. They ate black beans and drank cold water. They only wore tattered clothes, or used a cement paper bag to cover their bodies, wearing it when going down the mine, and using it as a quilt when sleeping. Dangerous mines often flooded and collapsed, and there were explosions of various harmful gases, which killed many workers. Therefore, anyone who had a slight way to maintain the most impoverished life elsewhere would not come to the mining area.

After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the miners overthrew the man-eating exploiters and became the masters of the mines. With the help of Soviet experts, they successively abolished backward coal mining methods and improved working conditions in many mines. Now, the larger mining areas have coal cutting machines, electric drills, electric winches, endless rope cars, belt conveyors, coal chutes, automatic overturning mine cars, ventilators, water pumps, and combined coal mining machines. Recently, a new type of combined tunneling machine has also appeared. With ventilation equipment, the tunnels have a suitable temperature all year round. Sprinkling equipment controls the flying coal dust. Workers operate various machines to mine coal in a safe environment, and shuttle-like coal cars transport coal from underground to the ground. In 1952, only 17.9% of the coal in Shanxi Province was mined by machinery, and in 1956, the proportion of mechanical coal mining reached 98.30%.

The lives of the miners have also changed greatly. In the past eight years, the state has invested in building more than 783,000 square meters of housing for the miners, and has also built hospitals, bathhouses, schools, nurseries, sanatoriums, recuperation centers, cultural palaces... Wages have been generally increased, everyone has several sets of clothes, added new quilts, many people have bought bicycles, and some have even bought radios and watches.

The rich mine is attracting more and more people to her embrace every day. In the early days of liberation, there were about 12,000 coal mine employees in the province, and now it has increased to more than 61,000. The coal extraction rate has increased from about 30% before liberation to the current 80%-95%. In 1949, the average state-owned coal mine employee could only produce 389 kilograms of coal per day, and in 1957, each person could produce 1,029 kilograms per day, an increase in production efficiency of more than one and a half times. Now, there are more than 20 state-owned coal mines and more than 1,000 small and medium-sized coal mines in the province, and nearly 60,000 tons of raw coal are mined from underground every day. In 1949, the state-owned coal mines produced 1,034,000 tons of coal annually. It is estimated that the annual output of raw coal will reach 13,370,000 tons in 1957, an increase of twelve times. Shanxi Province started to have modern coal mines in 1898. At that time, the Shanxi Provincial Bureau of Commerce signed a contract with a British imperialist company to open a mine in Yangquan. In the fifty years up to 1948, the highest annual output of machine-mined coal in the province was only 4,549,000 tons. In 1957, it exceeded the highest annual output in history by nearly two times. The growth in production level in the past eight years would have taken ninety-seven years to achieve in old China.

The scale of capital construction in Shanxi's coal industry is magnificent and the speed is amazing. During the period of the first Five-Year Plan, the state-owned coal mines alone originally planned to build 16 new mine shafts, restore 3 pairs, and renovate 10 pairs, adding a total production capacity of 16,630,000 tons. The actual execution result has exceeded the plan. Within five years, construction started on 20 new mine shafts, 6 pairs were restored, and 10 pairs were renovated, adding a production capacity of 22 million tons. Among them, 4 pairs of new mine shafts, 5 pairs of restored mine shafts, and 1 pair of renovated mine shafts were completed and put into production within five years, adding a total production capacity of 4.9 million tons; most of them will be completed and put into production in the next two or three years. The achievements we have made in coal mine capital construction in the past eight years would have taken two hundred and thirty-one years to achieve in old China. However, an even larger scale of construction is still ahead. Coal mine construction workers are preparing to welcome a new high tide of coal mine construction.

    “乌金”的故乡
    顾页　高峰
    人们都知道山西是我国的“煤铁之乡”。但地下究竟有多少煤，长久以来却一直是个谜。解放以前，几乎没有在任何一个地方进行过认真的钻探勘察。解放以后，煤炭工业部在山西成立了华北煤田地质勘探局，七千多的钻探人员踏遍纵横交错的山野，经过三年多的努力，已经提出了一个比较接近实际的数字：山西境内煤的蕴藏总量约在四千亿吨左右。这个数字，比1937年举行的国际地质会议对全中国煤炭总藏量的估计数还多五百亿吨；占目前全国煤炭已知储量的三分之二；按目前山西煤矿的生产水平，可供我们开采几万年。
    在山西全省的一百个县市中，就有八十八个县市的地下有煤。这些煤一般都是大面积均衡生成的，离土地表面较近，煤层平缓稳定，断层又少，十分便利开采。山西的煤种也很齐全，有丰富的炼焦用煤，有一般工业动力用的煤，还有炼油和化学工业需要的煤，以及大量的民用煤等十余种。山西的确是祖国名不虚传的“乌金”的故乡。
    人们忆起从前矿区的情景，内心便充满恐怖和仇恨。解放前流传着一句话：“走头无路才下窑”。就是矿工悲惨生活的真实写照。当时，剥削者每天用大棒和枪杆强逼着矿工们到那毫无安全保障的矿井里去。工人们在潮湿、阴暗和窒息的井巷中，以筐排水，积水排不完，便在水中泡着干活，并且每天要在弥漫煤粉和石渣的地方裸着身子，用手工刨煤达十几个小时。他们吃黑豆，喝凉水。穿的只是一身破襟襟，或者用一块水泥纸袋遮遮身体，下井穿它，睡觉还用它当被子。危险的矿井常常冒水塌顶，还有各种有害气体的爆炸，不知断送了多少工人的生命。因此，只要在别处稍有办法维持最贫困的生活的人，便不肯到矿区来。
    解放后，矿工们在党的领导下打倒了吃人的剥削者，成了矿山的主人。他们在苏联专家的帮助下，在许多矿里相继废除了落后的采煤方法，改善了劳动条件。现在，较大的矿区都有截煤机、电钻、电绞车、无极绳车、皮带运输机、煤溜子、自动翻矿车、抽风机、水泵，以及联合采煤机，最近又出现了新型联合掘进机。有了通风机械，井巷里一年四季都有适宜的温度。洒水设备治服了飞扬的煤粉。工人们在确有安全保障的环境里操纵各种机械采煤，穿梭般的煤车把煤炭从井下运到地面。1952年山西省只有17.9％的煤是用机械采出来的，1956年机械采煤的比重就达到98.30％。
    矿工们的生活也已大变了。八年来，国家投资给矿工们建筑的住宅有七十八万三千多平方公尺，还修建了医院、澡塘、学校、托儿所、疗养院、休养所、文化宫……。工资普遍提高，谁都有几身衣服，添了新被，许多人买了自行车，有的还买了收音机和手表。
    富饶的矿山，一天天吸引着更多的人来到她的怀抱里。解放初期，全省煤矿职工约一万二千多人，现在已增至六万一千多人。煤炭采出率由解放前的30％左右提高到目前的80％—95％。1949年国营煤矿的职工平均每人每天只能生产三百八十九公斤煤炭，1957年每人每天能生产一千零二十九公斤，生产效率提高一倍半以上。现在，全省有二十多座国营煤矿和一千多座中小型煤矿，每昼夜有约近六万吨原煤从地下开采出来。1949年国营煤矿年产煤炭一百零三万四千吨，1957年预计年产原煤达一千三百三十七万吨，增加了十二倍。山西省从1898年开始有现代煤矿，当时是由山西省商务局同英帝国主义的一个公司订立合同在阳泉开办的，到1948年的这五十年间，全省机器开采煤矿的最高年产量仅仅达到四百五十四万九千吨。1957年超过历史上最高年产量将近二倍。八年来生产水平的增长，在旧中国要九十七年才能达到。
    山西煤炭工业基本建设的规模宏伟，速度惊人。第一个五年计划期间，仅国营煤矿原计划要新建矿井即达十六对，恢复三对，改建十对，共增加生产能力一千六百六十三万吨。实际执行结果已超过计划，五年内开工新建矿井二十对，恢复六对，改建十对，增加生产能力二千二百万吨。其中五年内完工投入生产的新井四对，恢复矿井五对，改建矿井一对，共增加生产能力四百九十万吨；大部分将在今后两三年内完工投入生产。我们在解放八年来煤矿基本建设的成绩，旧中国要二百三十一年才能达到。但是，更大规模的建设还在后头呢，煤矿建设工人们正准备迎接一个煤矿建设的新高潮。
