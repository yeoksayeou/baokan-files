Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 13th. Cadres of the Yunnan Provincial Higher People's Court have recently held a series of meetings to expose the reactionary words and deeds of rightist Yu Fucheng. Yu Fucheng is a judge of the Yunnan Provincial Higher People's Court and a member of the Communist Youth League. He consistently opposed the leadership of the Communist Party and the system of people's democratic dictatorship under the guise of so-called "legal viewpoints." He slandered the Communist Party for "emphasizing rule by people and not rule by law," saying that the Kuomintang's reactionary "Six Codes" were better than today's "no law." Yu Fucheng also deliberately adopted the malicious tactic of not following the law in his judicial work. He set such a guideline for himself: to release as many [criminals] as possible when there was an opportunity, and if they could not be released, to reduce the sentences of counter-revolutionaries when determining the penalty. It has been revealed that over the past year or so, more than forty cases have been handled by Yu Fucheng in this way. For example, in one case, the counter-revolutionary had participated in Kuomintang secret agent activities before liberation, compiled blacklists at Yunnan University, and sabotaged the student movement; after liberation, he actively supported the activities of a counter-revolutionary group, and was therefore sentenced to imprisonment by the Kunming Municipal Intermediate People's Court. When this counter-revolutionary appealed to the Provincial Higher People's Court, Yu Fucheng unreasonably denied many of his incriminating evidence and changed the judgment to exemption from criminal punishment.

It was revealed that Yu Fucheng even incited counter-revolutionaries to overturn verdicts. When he was trying a case of a reform-through-labor prisoner who resisted reform and sabotaged production, he groundlessly told the defendant that "the facts of the defendant's crime in the original judgment were inconsistent," attempting to instigate the prisoner to overturn the verdict. Regarding some criminals who were released based on the lenient policy of education, Yu Fucheng even privately "represented" the court to admit "mistakes" to the defendants during sentencing.

Many people, when criticizing this rightist's reactionary words and deeds, said that Yu Fucheng was a class alien who had infiltrated the national judicial organs and the Communist Youth League. Yu Fucheng came from a landlord family. Since he infiltrated the Southwest Branch of the Supreme People's Court in 1951, he had repeatedly incited landlords to counter-settle accounts with peasants. For example, in 1953, when he took the opportunity to return to his hometown of Yunyang County, Sichuan Province, to visit relatives, he spread fallacies such as "the land reform was messed up" and "land reform should only divide land, not divide floating wealth" to some landlords and rich peasants, attempting to incite these landlords and rich peasants to settle accounts with the peasants.

　　并非“无法可依”而是“有法不依”
　　于辅成利用职权破坏法制
　　判处反革命罪犯无罪  煽动反革命罪犯翻案
    新华社昆明13日电  云南省高级人民法院的干部最近连续集会，揭露右派分子于辅成的反动言行。于辅成是云南省高级人民法院的审判员、共青团员。他一贯假借所谓“法律观点”来反对共产党的领导和人民民主专政制度。诬蔑共产党“重人治不重法治”，说国民党反动的“六法”也比今天“无法”要好。于辅成并且在审判工作中故意采取了有法不依法的恶毒手段。他给他自己定下了这样一个方针：有机会就多放一些，放不了就在量刑上给反革命分子减轻判处。据揭露，最近一年多以来被于辅成这样审理的案件就有四十多件。例如有一案件中的反革命分子，解放前曾经参加过国民党特务活动，到云南大学开列黑名单破坏过学生运动；解放后又积极支持过一个反革命集团的活动，因而被昆明市中级人民法院判处徒刑。当这个反革命分子上诉到省高级人民法院时，于辅成却将他的许多罪证无理加以否定，改判为免除刑事处分。
    据揭露，于辅成甚至煽动反革命分子翻案。他在审理一个抗拒改造、破坏生产的劳改犯的案件时，竟毫无根据地告诉被告说：“原判被告罪行事实有出入”，企图鼓动这个犯人翻案。对一些根据宽大政策教育释放的犯罪分子，于辅成在宣判时竟私自“代表”法院向被告承认“错误”。
    许多人在批判这个右派分子的反动言行时说，于辅成是一个混入国家司法机关和共青团内的阶级异己分子。于辅成出身于地主阶级家庭，他从1951年混入最高人民法院西南分院以后，就曾经多次煽动地主向农民反攻倒算。如1953年，他乘回到四川省云阳县家乡省亲的机会，就向一些地主、富农分子散布“土地改革搞糟了”，“土地改革只能分土地，不应分浮财”等谬论，企图煽动这些地主、富农分子向农民倒算。
