At the time I arrived at the Heping First Cooperative in Pengxing Township, they were carrying out a debate on the two roads of socialism and capitalism. Assisting this cooperative in this work were several comrades from the Xiaogan Prefectural Committee Work Group of the Chinese Communist Party. On the second day after I visited the debate in the Fifth Production Team, Comrade Xiao Shi, a member of the work group, spared some time to introduce the debate situation here to me:

"We first held a training session for backbone members such as the team leaders, work point recorders, Youth League group leaders, and some activists, totaling sixty-four people (about 20% of all cooperative members). Initially, the cooperative director analyzed the current class struggle situation in the countryside and explained the significance of launching the debate on the two roads. Everyone then started debating. Many people talked about a prominent problem at present, which is that the masses are not obedient, especially some of the wealthier middle peasants, who have said many bad things about the cooperative and the state monopoly of purchase and marketing, even satirizing and scolding the cadres. Some people proposed that this rectification should first struggle against these people to vent their anger; however, some people thought that we should not struggle against them but should persuade them with reason, starting from the desire for unity, arguing that if we calculate the economic income accounts and political emancipation accounts of these two years with the wealthier middle peasants, they would have no reason to say that the cooperative and the state monopoly of purchase and marketing are not good. After the debate, most people agreed with the latter opinion. Everyone also debated with some people who had confused ideas. Gong Shuisheng (a Party member) suggested that being a member of the cooperative was not as good as being a hired laborer because he did not have enough pocket money. When everyone asked him how his current life compared to when he was a hired laborer, he became clear-headed. He also examined the fact that he saw his mother selling eggs and cloth coupons without intervening. He said that he only knew how to make money, and if he continued like this, he would be in danger of falling into the capitalist mire. Inspired by him, others also examined their right-leaning emotions of turning a blind eye to the destructive remarks of landlords and rich peasants…”

Xiao Shi’s words were like an unstoppable stream, pouring out endlessly:

“After the backbone members were trained, they basically knew how to draw a clear line between right and wrong, so they mobilized the masses in each production team to put forward their opinions on issues such as cooperativization, state monopoly of purchase and marketing, worker-peasant relations, and cadre work style. In addition to putting forward some constructive opinions, everyone mainly put forward many negative opinions, such as: the cooperative ties people down, it is not as free as working individually; even with socialism, life is still unequal; although the grain harvest is high, the sales are too severe, and we cannot keep a few more grains; oil coupons, cloth coupons, and bran coupons are not enough, and we are starving and freezing to death; the five-guarantee households should not be taken care of, etc. The main people who raised these opinions were the wealthier middle peasants, and the poor and lower-middle peasants also followed suit, their minds temporarily confused.”

How can these issues be debated clearly? Xiao Shi looked at the roof beams with both eyes, seemingly thinking about something, and then said:

"The debate must have a reliance—the poor and lower-middle peasants, who make up the majority of the cooperative members, are a very good reliance. We must help them clarify their confused ideas. Therefore, we convened a training session for the poor and lower-middle peasants and mobilized them to debate the negative opinions raised by everyone through recollection and comparison. During the debate, many people drew a clear line between right and wrong. For example, some people heard the wealthier middle peasants shouting: ‘Last year was a bumper harvest, and although we averaged 1,100 catties of grain per person, we sold too much, and as a result, the grain that was originally enough to eat for two years only lasted one year. This year's bumper harvest must keep more grain.’ They also followed suit. Now, after the debate, everyone clearly recognizes that selling more surplus grain and allowing the government to control more grain is beneficial to the majority of people; if the government does not control grain, in the event of a famine year, it will be like the old society where ‘rich people open warehouses and poor people suffer.’ Besides, we ate grain supported by all parts of the country in 1954 when we suffered from floods. Now that we have a bumper harvest, it is only right to sell more surplus grain to support the disaster areas. Many people felt that it was wrong to follow the wealthier middle peasants.”

Xiao Shi said that after raising the awareness of the poor and lower-middle peasants, they launched a mass debate—which is the debate currently underway. Because I had already visited the debate in the Fifth Team, he was not going to talk about it, but I asked him to continue.

“This debate is mainly based on the team as a unit,” he said, “However, at the beginning, it was not a face-to-face debate with a certain person, because the masses were not used to it. As some people said: ‘If I struggle against him today (they think debate is struggle), I will be using a waterwheel with him tomorrow, how can this be?’ In addition, doing so can easily make some wealthier middle peasants feel pressure. For this reason, we focused on the core content of the two roads, based on the opinions expressed in the ‘Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend’ campaign, and mobilized the masses to debate on matters, not on people. This debate not only allows everyone to speak freely and educates the poor and lower-middle peasants again, but more importantly, it also subtly criticizes some wealthier middle peasants with general capitalist ideas, prompting them to examine themselves. For example, Ye Hongchen, a wealthier middle peasant in the Sixth Team, once suggested: ‘After the government implemented the state monopoly of purchase and marketing, there is only enough grain to eat, and there is no surplus grain at home. This practice is not good.’ During the team's debate, Ye Hongchen's name was not mentioned, but everyone was mobilized to debate whether the state monopoly of purchase and marketing was good. Everyone spoke enthusiastically, recounted many facts from memory and comparison, and calculated the benefits of the state monopoly of purchase and marketing. Ye Hongchen remained silent. At the end, he automatically said: ‘I originally had some resistance to the state monopoly of purchase and marketing, which was the idea of taking the capitalist road. Now that I have listened to everyone's accounts and comparisons, I know that my idea is wrong.’”

Speaking of this, Xiao Shi stated that this kind of debate on matters, not on people, is only applicable to wealthier middle peasants whose capitalist ideas are not serious. For this kind of person with serious capitalist ideas, a face-to-face debate should be implemented. The masses have a lot of opinions about this kind of person, and there is no concern in implementing a face-to-face debate. However, Xiao Shi said that they did not do a good job when they started this debate, and the Third Team is an example. Gong Biqing, a wealthier middle peasant in this team, was not satisfied with the cooperative, the state monopoly of purchase and marketing, etc. He said that engaging in cooperation was slowly rectifying him, why not kill him with one knife? He also said many bad things about the cadres and the masses. During the debate, everyone brought out his remarks and asked him if he had said these things. He said he had forgotten. Later, everyone mentioned one point and he admitted one point. He declared that he said so with a bad attitude. The captain couldn't hold back and said loudly: "What if the attitude is not good?" Many people shouted: "We cannot negotiate peacefully with him, let him out (i.e., expel him)!" So the debate could not continue. Xiao Shi said that since this incident occurred, the work group has patiently educated the masses on reasoning struggle. Currently, the words of all thirteen wealthier middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas in the entire cooperative are being refuted one by one by the masses, citing facts and reasoning. The next step is to mobilize the masses to counterattack the destructive activities and remarks of landlords and rich peasants... As the conversation was coming to an end, I asked Xiao Shi to talk about his experience. He smiled and said: "This is a new job, there is no experience, but one thing to pay attention to is that we must believe in the majority of the masses, believe that the truth is on our side, and we should boldly mobilize the masses to launch a debate." He paused and said: "Although the debate has not ended yet, we can already see good signs: last year was a bumper harvest, and each person kept 1,100 catties of grain (including rations, feed, and increased production grain), but some people still said it was not enough and asked to keep more grain this year than last year. After this socialist education, some people no longer mention keeping more grain, but are brewing how to sell more surplus grain in the bumper harvest areas. Some people who used to grumble and say strange things have now become more disciplined and buried themselves in work... In short, the idea of loving the country, the cooperative, and the family has begun to be further established among the masses."

### 大辩论中依靠谁？

    大辩论中依靠谁？
    本报记者　古维进
    到了朋兴乡和平一社的时候，这里正在开展对社会主义和资本主义两条道路的辩论。协助这个社进行这个工作的是中共孝感地委工作组的几个同志。在我参观第五生产队辩论的第二天，工作员小石抽出时间给我介绍这里的辩论情况：
    “我们首先集训队长、记工员、团小组长以上的骨干和一部分积极分子共六十四人（约占全体社员20％）。开始，社主任给大家分析当前农村的阶级斗争形势和说明对两条道路展开辩论的重要意义，大家就辩论起来了。许多人谈到当前一个突出问题是群众不听话，特别是一部分富裕中农，对合作社和统购统销等说了许多坏话，甚至讽刺、谩骂干部。有些人提出这一次整风首先要斗争这些人，出一口气；但是有些人认为不能斗争，要从团结的愿望出发，以理服人，认为要是和富裕中农算一算这两年的经济收入账和政治翻身账，他们就没有理由说合作社和统购统销不好。辩论结果，大多数人同意了后面的意见。大家又和一些有糊涂思想的人辩论。龚水生（党员）因零用钱不足，提出当社员不如当长工。大家问他现在的生活比当长工的生活怎样？他就清醒过来了。他还检查了看见自己的母亲贩卖鸡蛋和布票，不加过问的事。他说，只晓得赚钱，这样下去，就有陷入资本主义泥坑的危险。其他的人受到他的启发，也检查了听到地主富农的破坏言论不闻不问的右倾情绪。……”
    小石的话如挡不住的流水，滔滔不绝：
    “骨干分子经过集训，基本上晓得划清是非界限，就在各个生产队发动群众就合作化、统购统销、工农关系、干部作风等问题提出意见。大家除了提出一些建设性的意见，主要提出了许多反面意见，如：合作社捆死人，不如单干自由；搞了社会主义，生活还是不平等；粮食虽然收得多，可是卖得狠，不能多留几颗；油票、布票、糠票不够用，吃穿克死人；五保户不该照顾，等等。提这些意见的主要是富裕中农，贫农下中农思想一时糊涂，也跟着叫喊。”
    怎样把这些问题辩论清楚呢？小石两只眼睛望着屋梁，似乎在想心事，接着说：
    “辩论必须有依靠——占社员大多数的贫农、下中农是很好的依靠。必须帮助他们澄清糊涂思想。因此，召集贫农、下中农受训，发动他们对大家提出的那些反面意见，以回忆对比的方式进行辩论。辩论中许多人都划清了是非界限。例如有些人听到富裕中农叫喊说：‘去年丰收，虽然平均每人分到粮食一千一百斤，但卖得狠了，结果，本来够吃二年的粮食，只吃一年，今年丰收一定要多留粮食。’他们也跟着叫喊起来。现在经过辩论，大家明确认识多售余粮，让政府多掌握粮食，对大多数人有好处；如果政府不掌握粮食，灾荒年到来，就会像旧社会那样‘富人开仓，穷人遭殃。’再说，1954年遭水灾，吃过全国各地支援的粮食，现在丰收，多售余粮支援灾区，也是理所应当。许多人感到跟着富裕中农叫喊是不对的。”
    小石说，提高贫农、下中农的认识之后，就展开群众性的大辩论——就是目前进行的辩论。因为我已经参观过五队的辩论，他不准备谈了，我要求他继续谈下去。
    “这个辩论主要是以队为单位。”他说，“但是，开始并不是对某一个人进行面对面的辩论，这样群众很不习惯，正如有些人说的：‘我今天把他斗了（他们认为辩论是斗争），明天又和他一块车水，这怎么成呢？’另外，这样做也容易使一些富裕中农感到有压力。为此，我们把鸣放出来的意见，围绕着两条道路的中心内容，发动群众进行对事不对人的辩论。这种辩论不仅使大家畅所欲言，使贫农、下中农又受到一次教育，更重要的是使一些有一般资本主义思想的富裕中农也无形中受到批判，检查自己。例如六队的富裕中农叶洪琛曾经提出一个意见说：‘政府搞了统购统销之后，粮食只够吃，家无存粮，这个作法不好。’队里辩论的时候，不提叶洪琛的名字，只是发动大家就统购统销好不好这一问题进行辩论。大家热烈发言，以回忆对比的许多事实，算了一笔统购统销的好处账。叶洪琛默默无言。末了，他自动发言说：‘我原来对统购统销有点抵触思想，这是想走资本主义道路的思想，现在听了大家算账对比，才知道自己的想法不对头。’”
    说到这里，小石声明这种对事不对人的辩论，除了对资本主义思想不严重的富裕中农适用外，对有严重资本主义思想的富裕中农是不适用的。对于这种人，应该实行面对面的辩论。群众对这种人的意见很大，实行面对面的辩论是没有顾虑的。但是，小石说他们开始进行这种辩论的时候，没有搞好，三队就是一个例子。这个队的富裕中农龚必清对合作社、统购统销等都不满意，说搞合作社是慢慢整他，为什么不把他一刀杀死呢？还说了干部和群众的许多坏话。辩论的时候，大家把他的言论都端出来，问他是不是说过这些话？他说忘记了。后来大家提一点他承认一点。他声明他这样说是态度不好。队长沉不住气了，高声说：“态度不好怎么办？”许多人嚷道：“不能跟他和平谈判，叫他出去（即开除）！”于是辩论辩不下去了。小石说，自从发生这件事情之后，工作组耐心地给群众进行了说理斗争的教育。现在全社十三个有严重资本主义思想的富裕中农的言论，正在被群众摆事实讲道理一个一个的驳倒，下一步他们就要发动群众对地主、富农的破坏活动言论进行反击。……谈话快结束了，我要小石谈一谈经验，他笑了一笑，说：“这是新工作，没得经验，不过有一点要注意的，就是必须相信群众的多数，相信真理是在我们这一边，应该大胆放手地发动群众展开辩论。”他顿了顿，又说：“现在虽然辩论还没结束，已经可以看出好的苗头：去年丰收，每人留粮一千一百斤（包括口粮、饲料、增产粮），有些人还说不够用，要求今年比去年多留粮食。经过这一次社会主义教育，有些人不再提多留粮食了，而是酝酿着在丰收地区怎样多售余粮。过去有些发牢骚说怪话的人，现在变得规矩一些，埋头干活了……总之，爱国爱社爱家的思想开始在群众中进一步树立起来了。”
