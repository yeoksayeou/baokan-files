Xinhua News Agency, 6th. This evening, four thousand five hundred Beijing youth and one hundred and eleven young friends from twenty-five countries held a joint celebration in Zhongshan Park. This celebration was organized by the Beijing Democratic Youth Federation.

    Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, delivered a speech at the beginning of the celebration, welcoming the young friends from various countries. He said, we hope you will see our cultural relics and also see our construction work in progress. Wherever you go in our country, the youth of our country will extend a hand of friendship to you. Liao Chengzhi also said that there are various sayings about New China circulating in the world. However, there is a Chinese saying: "Seeing is believing." We believe that through your own observation, you will gain a further understanding of New China. This firsthand understanding will undoubtedly help enhance the friendship between us.

    Inside the concert hall, flowers like colorful balls were tossed around the venue. On the stage, young friends from twenty-five countries waved flowers and chanted rhythmically with the youth below the stage in Chinese: "Long live peace!" "Long live peace!"

    As soon as the Beijing opera "Havoc in the Dragon Palace" ended, the bands in front of Zhongshan Hall and on the Altar of Land and Grain began to play. Beijing youth and young friends from various countries formed dance circles, dancing to the music. Some sat around on the steps chatting intimately, while others exchanged souvenirs, leaving each other with mailing addresses.

    北京青年和各国青年联欢
    新华社6日讯　今天晚上，北京四千五百个青年和二十五个国家的一百一十一个青年朋友，在中山公园内举行联欢。这次联欢是由北京市民主青年联合会举办的。
    中华全国民主青年联合会主席廖承志在联欢开始时致词，向各国青年朋友表示欢迎。他说，我们希望你们看看我国的文化古迹，也看看我们正在进行的建设工作。在我们的国家里，不论你们走到那里，我国青年都会向你们伸出友谊的手。廖承志又说，世界上流传着各种各样关于新中国的说法。但是，中国有句俗话：“百闻不如一见”。我们相信通过你们亲自的观察，会对新中国得到进一步的了解。这种亲身获得的了解，无疑将有助于增进我们之间的友谊。
    音乐堂内鲜花像彩球似的在全场掷来掷去。主席台上，二十五个国家的青年朋友手舞鲜花和台下的青年们一齐用中国话有节奏地喊着：“和平万岁！”“和平万岁！”
    京剧“闹龙宫”刚结束，在中山堂前和社稷坛上的乐队就吹奏起来。北京青年和各国青年朋友组成一个个舞圈，在音乐声中翩翩起舞。有的围坐在台阶上亲切交谈，有的在交换纪念品，相互留下了通信地址。
