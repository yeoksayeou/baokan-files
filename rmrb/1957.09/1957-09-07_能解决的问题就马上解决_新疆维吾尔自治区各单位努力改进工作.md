    Solve Problems That Can Be Solved Immediately
    Various Units in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Strive to Improve Work
    (Our newspaper Urumqi dispatch) The Communist Party organizations of various units in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, in the spirit of "rectification while correcting," have been addressing the correct opinions raised by the masses. They are solving problems that can be solved immediately, and for problems that cannot be solved temporarily or require instructions from higher authorities, responsible comrades are providing explanations and clarifications to the masses, who have expressed satisfaction.
    The Animal Husbandry Department is actively preparing for the establishment of the Xinjiang branch of the Veterinary Society based on the opinions of the masses. The cooperation problem between the Xinjiang Academy of Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Sciences and the August 1st Agricultural College, which had not been resolved for a long time, has been resolved after research by both parties. The leadership of the Agriculture Department has paid attention to the opinions raised by comrades regarding frequent cadre transfers and overstaffing in some units. The Transportation Department and the Highway Bureau have strengthened the handling of letters and visits from the people. In terms of welfare, the leading cadres of some units have paid special attention to sharing weal and woe with the masses.
