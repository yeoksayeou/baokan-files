　　Not Growing in a Greenhouse, But Tempering in Struggle:
　　Guangming Cooperative Improves Backbone Team Through Great Debates
　　(Our Newspaper News) The Guangming Cooperative in Xingren Township, Juining County, Jiangsu Province, has tempered and improved its backbone team through the great blooming, great contending, and great debate, creating the preconditions for achieving a victory in the comprehensive unfolding of socialist great debate.
　　Before the Guangming Cooperative launched the great debate, many muddled ideas also existed among the party members and cadres. Many people believed that as long as there was grain and money, the masses would actively produce without propaganda. Some cadres believed that the grain problem was a practical problem and could not be blamed on the masses' complaints.
　　After the county party committee's work team understood the above situation, it decided to first organize cadres to conduct great blooming, great contending, and great debate, to truly arm the cadres' minds. First, a meeting of party members, Communist Youth League members, and cadres above the production team leader level was held in the cooperative. This meeting mainly carried out enlightening education of great blooming and great contending, mobilizing everyone to give full play to free thought and say whatever they had to say. In order to enable party members and cadres to feel comfortable and say everything they wanted to say, they first clarified their ideological concerns about blooming and contending. Then, the leaders focused on explaining why they should bloom and contend, and also clarified that the attitude they should hold towards blooming and contending was to know everything and say everything without reservation.
　　Through blooming and contending, it became clear that the main problems in terms of grain were doubting the importance of unified purchase and sale and complaining about the low grain ration standards. Therefore, the cadres present were immediately organized to debate these two issues.
　　When it came to whether unified purchase and sale was good, the majority agreed that the benefits of unified purchase and sale were endless. The conclusion of the debate on the grain ration standard issue was: the living standards of poor and lower-middle peasants were now higher than in the past, not lower; only the landlords, rich peasants, and a few upper-middle peasants were slightly lower than in the past. Ma Yufeng criticized the claim that there was not enough to eat, saying: "Take my family as an example, all four are adults. Since May 19, we have been allocated 385 jin of grain. We have eaten for 80 days now, and there are still 35 jin of wheat at home. This is still during the busy May and June. In winter and spring, we will eat even less. In short, as long as we are careful, 365 jin is enough to eat." Shi Yicai said: "If we don't recall the past and compare it with the present, we will forget the bitter days of the past and not see the good days of the present."
　　After the first debate, the cooperative held a second backbone meeting, and also absorbed forty-one poor peasant activists to attend as observers. Based on the issues that everyone debated, it summarized and conducted positive education with analysis, and criticized the specific fallacies that emerged during the blooming and contending. After the meeting, a half-day was organized for discussion to further improve understanding, so that party members, Communist Youth League members, and cadres thoroughly distinguished the right and wrong boundaries on the grain issue. After initially training the debate backbone of party members, Communist Youth League members, and team leaders, it mobilized the masses to bloom and contend.
　　After the masses' blooming and contending ended, before the great debate began, the leadership again held meetings of poor and lower-middle peasants by production team, focusing on the main issues that emerged during the blooming and contending. Through detailed accounting, recalling and comparing, and using typical examples to conduct debates. And analyzed and criticized those dissatisfied remarks that emerged during the blooming and contending, to see who these wrong remarks were beneficial to and who they were detrimental to, and to draw a clear class boundary. After enlightenment and debate, many poor and lower-middle peasants quickly raised their awareness and consciously conducted self-criticism. The poor peasant Wang Chengkou said: "I used to be a hired laborer, and my children couldn't afford to go to school at all. Now my children are in middle school and have enough to eat and wear. But this spring, I shouted that the grain ration was tight. In fact, my family's grain ration this spring was not only not tight, but also had a surplus of 170 jin which I sold on the black market. This kind of thinking should be considered capitalist and individualistic thinking, and I am determined to correct it in the future." This shows that the poor and lower-middle peasants, through the education of this meeting, have greatly improved in terms of ideological understanding and class consciousness.

    不在温室里生长　要在斗争中锻炼
    光明社通过大辩论提高骨干队伍
    本报讯　江苏省雎宁县兴仁乡光明社通过大鸣大放大辩论，在实际斗争中锻炼和提高了社的骨干队伍，为取得全面开展社会主义大辩论的胜利创造了前提条件。
    光明社开展大辩论之前，党员和干部中也存在着许多糊涂思想。不少人认为：只要有粮有钱，不宣传群众也会积极生产。有些干部认为粮食问题是实际问题，并不能怪群众吵闹。
    县委工作组在摸清上述情况后，决定首先组织干部进行大鸣大放大争，把干部的思想真正武装起来。首先，以社为单位召开党、团员及生产队长以上干部会议，这个会议主要进行了大放大鸣的启发教育，动员大家发挥自由思想，有什么说什么。为使党、团员干部能够心情舒畅，把心里要说的话全部说出来，先摸清了他们对鸣放的思想顾虑，然后由领导上重点讲述了为什么要大鸣大放，还讲明了对大鸣大放应抱的态度是知无不言，言无不尽。
    通过鸣放，弄清楚了在粮食方面的主要问题是怀疑统购统销的重要性、对口粮标准嫌低等。因此，即组织到会干部就这两个问题展开了辩论。
    提到统购统销好不好，大多数人一致认为统购统销好处说不尽。对口粮标准问题辩论的结论是：贫农和下中农现在吃粮水平比过去不是低而是高，只有地主、富农和少数上中农比过去稍低，马玉凤批判不够吃的说法道：“拿我家来说，四口都是大人，从5月19日分三百八十五斤粮，现在已吃了八十天，现在家里还有三十五斤小麦，这还是五忙六月，如到冬春那吃的就更少，总之，只要精打细算，三百六十五斤是够吃的。”史一才说：“如果不回忆过去比比现在，就忘了过去的苦日子，看不到现在的好日子。”
    经过一次辩论后，社里又举行第二次骨干会，还吸收了四十一个贫农积极分子列席。根据大家所辩论的问题归纳起来，有分析的进行正面教育，并对鸣放出来的具体的谬论进行批判。会后又以半天时间组织讨论，进一步提高认识，使党、团员及干部彻底划清粮食问题上的是非界限。在初步训练了党、团员及队长以上的辩论骨干后，即在群众中发动鸣放。
    在群众鸣放结束以后，大辩论开始以前，领导上又以生产队为单位，召开贫农和下中农会议，针对鸣放出来的主要问题，通过算细账，回忆对比，以典型实例进行辩论。并对鸣放出来的那些不满言论，进行分析批判，看这些错误的言论，对谁有利，对谁不利，划清阶级界限。很多贫农和下中农经过启发和辩论之后，很快提高了觉悟，自觉进行检讨。贫农王成扣说：“我过去一贯做雇工，小孩根本上不起学校，现在我小孩也上中学了，够吃够穿的，但我今春喊口粮紧，实际我家今春口粮不但不紧，还结余一百七十斤卖了黑市，我这种思想，要算资本主义和个人主义思想，今后决心改正。”这说明贫农和下中农通过这个会议的教育，在思想认识、阶级觉悟方面是有很大提高的。
