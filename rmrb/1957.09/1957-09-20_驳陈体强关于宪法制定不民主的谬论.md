Refuting Chen Tiqiang's Fallacy that Constitution Formulation Was Undemocratic
Jiao Shizhai

    Rightist Chen Tiqiang from the legal profession slandered our great Constitution of the People's Republic of China in every possible way at a forum in the legal field. He fabricated stories, saying that although one hundred million people discussed the draft constitution at the time, it was actually just a study, only two articles were revised, and they were not important. In the future, we should not wait for the draft to mature before asking everyone to discuss it. He used this to say that our country's legislation does not have the democracy of bourgeois countries. Like the "finished product theory" of rightist Zhang Bojun, he did his best to reverse black and white and talk nonsense.

    As everyone knows, the initial draft of the constitution was proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. As far as I know, the original full text had only ninety-seven articles. On March 23, 1954, the Drafting Committee of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China accepted this initial draft of the constitution and immediately organized more than 8,000 representatives from various democratic parties, people's organizations, and social sectors in Beijing and major cities across the country. They spent more than two months conducting serious discussions and put forward more than 8,900 suggestions for revision and supplementation. After careful and repeated study of these suggestions, the Drafting Committee of the Constitution put forward the "Revised Proposal for the Initial Draft of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China" and submitted it to the then highest state organ, the Central People's Government Committee, for discussion. After this discussion, except for seven articles that remained unchanged, three articles were deleted from the entire text of the initial draft of the constitution, and the remaining articles were revised and supplemented to varying degrees.

    Not only that, but on June 14, 1954, the Central People's Government Committee published the revised draft constitution and submitted it to the people of the whole country for discussion. This lasted for more than two months, and the people of the whole country participated with unparalleled enthusiasm in the creation of their own constitution, which they had long dreamed of. More than 150 million people directly participated in the discussion of the draft constitution. Of course, the process of discussing the constitution by the people of the whole country was also a process of learning, because only by truly understanding the content and significance of the draft constitution can we truly conduct in-depth discussions and put forward opinions. This spirit of legislative democracy is something that any bourgeois country does not have and cannot have. After such a heated discussion on the draft constitution by the broad masses of the people, 1,180,420 suggestions for revision and supplementation were put forward (compiled into fourteen volumes). The Drafting Committee of the Constitution revised many articles of the draft constitution based on these many opinions, and some of them were important revisions. For example, the third paragraph of Article 3, "All ethnic groups have the freedom to develop their own languages and scripts," was changed to "All ethnic groups have the freedom to use and develop their own languages and scripts"; Article 5, "There are currently four types of ownership," was changed to "There are now mainly four types of ownership"; Paragraph 2 of Article 79 added the provision that "People's courts at higher levels supervise the adjudication work of people's courts at lower levels," and the establishment of procuratorial committees in the People's Procuratorate, etc.; and textual and rhetorical changes are not included.

    These facts, as stated by Chairman Liu Shaoqi in the "Report on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China," "Due to the adoption of the opinions of the masses, the draft constitution has been revised in several places, some of which are substantive revisions, and some of which are textual and rhetorical revisions." Until the First Session of the First National People's Congress, the delegates to the congress conducted detailed discussions for many days before it was passed. Does this not fully prove that our great constitution, which embodies the people's democratic dictatorship, was completed through serious drafting work and extensive democratic discussion? If Chen Tiqiang's frantic attack on the Party this time had not reached a state of mental disorder, how could he have uttered the nonsense that the discussion and adoption of the constitution was undemocratic?

    To illustrate the true democratic nature of our constitution, the more important issue lies in the socialist essence of our constitution. As everyone knows, our constitution was formulated on the basis of the victorious implementation of the Common Program, in order to gradually realize the country's socialist industrialization in our country, and to gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. It is a constitution that aims to replace all non-socialist ownership with socialist ownership in our country, completely eliminate all systems of exploitation, and realize a socialist society where everyone does their best and distributes according to their work; it represents the interests of all ethnic groups in the country and is a reliable guarantee for the happiness of all the people. The rapid development of socialist transformation and socialist construction in our country and the universal improvement of the cultural and material lives of our people in the past few years since the promulgation of the constitution have not been powerful proof of this? And this is something that the constitution of any capitalist country cannot compare with. Take the American constitution, which Chen Tiqiang often looks up to, for example, even though bourgeois "scholars" tout it as being "democratic," its class essence is that a few people oppress and exploit the majority, and it is fundamentally anti-democratic. Even in form, they have no democracy. For example, the 1787 U.S. Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia was only composed of representatives of fifty-five financiers, slave owners, shipowners, etc. Therefore, a truly democratic constitution can only exist in socialist countries; and genuine nationwide discussion can only exist in socialist countries. Is there any doubt about this?

    Since the facts are like this, why does this "jurist" who personally participated in the discussion of the draft constitution insist that the discussion of our draft constitution was undemocratic? If we further link his other absurd remarks made at the same time as he was slandering our constitution, such as his vicious attack on the state system of people's democratic dictatorship, his demand that we move the democratic system of the bourgeoisie, and his demand that we inherit the international law of the bourgeoisie, then the problem becomes even clearer. He was originally speaking for the landlord class, the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and even imperialism that had already died out in our country, that is, for those enemies of the people who are dissatisfied with our great constitution, attempting to overthrow the leadership of the Party and socialism, and restore the capitalist system. Could there be any other explanation?

　　驳陈体强关于宪法制定不民主的谬论
　　焦实斋
    法律界右派分子陈体强在法学界座谈会上对我们伟大的中华人民共和国宪法，曾经百般地污蔑。他信口雌黄地说，当初宪法草案虽有一亿人讨论，但实际是学习，只修改了两条，而且也不重要，今后不应该等草案成熟才拿出来要大家讨论。他以此来说我们国家的立法没有资产阶级国家的民主。他和右派分子章伯钧的“成品论”一样，是极尽其颠倒黑白、胡说八道的能事。
    大家知道，宪法草案初稿，是中共中央提出的，就我所知，最初全文只有九十七条。1954年3月23日中华人民共和国宪法起草委员会接受了这个宪法草案初稿，随即在北京和全国各大城市组织各民主党派、各人民团体和社会各方面代表人物共八千多人，用两个多月的时间，进行了认真的讨论，提出了修改和补充的意见八千九百多条。宪法起草委员会根据这些修改和补充的意见，经过周密地反复地研究后，又提出“对于中华人民共和国宪法草案初稿的修改方案”，送交当时的国家最高机关中央人民政府委员会讨论。经过这次讨论，宪法草案初稿的全部条文除有七条条文照原文未动外，三条条文被删去，其余各条也都在不同程度上作了修改和补充。
    不仅如此，中央人民政府委员会在1954年6月14日又将修改后的宪法草案公布，交付全国人民讨论。这又进行了两个多月之久，全国人民以无比的热情来参与这长期以来梦寐以求的自己宪法的创制工作，仅直接参加宪法草案讨论的就有一亿五千万人之多。当然对宪法的创制，全国人民讨论的过程，同样也是学习的过程，因为只有使群众真正明白了宪法草案的内容和意义，才能真正展开深入的讨论，提出意见。这种立法的民主精神，正是任何资产阶级国家所没有，也不可能有的。广大人民群众对宪法草案经过这样的热烈讨论后，提出了一百一十八万零四百二十条修改和补充的意见（汇编成十四册）。宪法起草委员会又根据这许多意见对宪法草案的不少条文作了修改，而且有些是重要的修改，例如：将第三条第三款各民族都有发展自己的语言文字的自由，改为各民族都有使用和发展自己的语言文字的自由；第五条现有四种所有制，改为现在主要有四种所有制，第七十九条第二款增加了“上级人民法院监督下级人民法院的审判工作”的规定，以及人民检察院增设检察委员会等等；而文字和修辞上的改动，尚不在内。
    这些事实，正如刘少奇委员长在“关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告”里所说的，“由于采纳了群众的意见，宪法草案已经有若干改动，有些是内容的改动，有些是文字和修辞上的改动”。直到第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议期间大会代表们更进行了很多天的详细的讨论，而后才付通过。这难道还不充分证明我国的体现人民民主专政的伟大宪法是经过郑重的起草工作和广泛的民主讨论而完成的吗？如果陈体强这次向党疯狂进攻不是到了神经失常状态的话，怎么能说出宪法讨论通过不民主的胡言乱语呢？
    要说明我们宪法的真正民主性，更重要的问题还在于我们宪法的社会主义的实质。大家知道，我们的宪法是在共同纲领胜利贯彻的基础上，为了在我国逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造而制定的。它是要在我国用社会主义的所有制来代替一切非社会主义的所有制，彻底消灭一切剥削制度，实现各尽所能、按劳分配的社会主义社会的宪法；它是代表全国各族人民利益的，是全体人民都能获得幸福生活的可靠保证。宪法公布后这几年来，我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设的飞跃发展，我国人民文化生活和物质生活的普遍提高，不正是有力地证明吗？而这是任何资本主义国家的宪法所不能比的，就拿陈体强所经常仰望的美国宪法来说，尽管资产阶级“学者”标榜它是怎样“民主”，但它是少数人压迫和剥削多数人的阶级本质，根本是反民主的，甚至在形式上他们也没有民主，例如1787年美国费城制宪会议只是由五十五个金融家、奴隶主、船主等代表所组成。因此真正的民主宪法，只有在社会主义国家才有；真正的全民讨论，也只有社会主义国家才有，这难道还有任何疑问吗？
    事实既然如此，那么这位亲身参加过宪法草案讨论的“法律家”，为什么硬说我们宪法草案讨论不民主呢？如果再联系他在污蔑我们宪法的同时所说的其他一些荒谬言论，例如他恶毒地攻击人民民主专政的国家制度，要我们搬运资产阶级的民主制度，要我们继承资产阶级的国际法，那么问题就更加明显了，他原是替在我国已经死亡了的地主阶级、官僚资产阶级乃至帝国主义在说话，亦即是替那些不满我国伟大宪法的人民的敌人在说话，企图推翻党的领导和社会主义，恢复建立资本主义制度，难道还能有其他任何解释吗？
