Where Are They Wrong?
A Debate on Right-Leaning Thoughts within the Party at a CCP Jiangsu Provincial County Committee Secretary Meeting
Zhen Weimin, Xue Jin'ao

In the new situation following rural collectivization, the vast majority of our Party's rural leading cadres have been able to discern right from wrong on major issues from the contradictions and developments of reality, using correct standpoints and viewpoints. However, a small number of rural leading cadres have been misled by the capitalist clamoring of a few wealthy middle peasants, and have lost their way in the midst of the still-existing struggle between two roads, demonstrating serious right-leaning thoughts and sentiments. A serious and conscientious criticism of right-leaning thoughts within the Party, in order to achieve unity of understanding within the Party, is the key to ensuring the smooth development of the all-people debate in the countryside. At a recent county committee secretary meeting convened by the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (including the heads of the county committee cooperative departments and one district committee secretary from each county) to deploy and discuss rural socialist education centered on the grain issue before autumn, just such a debate on criticizing right-leaning thoughts within the Party occurred. This debate was triggered by the speeches of two comrades, Xu Daokuan, the head of the Yizheng County Committee's Cooperative Department, and Zhang Zhiqu, the Party Secretary of Daji Township in Yizheng, during group discussions. At the beginning of the meeting, when discussing the rural situation, Xu Daokuan and Zhang Zhiqu expressed a series of erroneous views. Zhang Zhiqu believed that it was impossible to reason with (a few) wealthy middle peasants about their capitalist ideas in the current rural situation. Because, "disregard for collective interests is a widespread phenomenon," and it is impossible to convince them if only a few cadres are reasoning with the wealthy middle peasants. Zhang Zhiqu also cited some facts to prove his erroneous point of view. He said: 80% of the peasants in the countryside are dissatisfied with the current situation, and the essence of their dissatisfaction is the desire to improve their lives. Some poor peasants, after working for a year, cannot even get back enough grain to feed themselves, saying that it is not as good as being a hired laborer.

This township Party secretary even doubted the Party's class policy of relying on poor peasants and uniting with middle peasants. He reflected the opinions of wealthy middle peasants, saying: "It is unreliable to rely on poor and hired peasants to build socialism. Some poor peasants constantly ask for relief and loans, saying that the government is an old friend. How can we build socialism by relying on them?"

Zhang Zhiqu's erroneous remarks were criticized by several representatives from Jiangpu, Hanjiang, and other counties in the group meeting at the time, but not only did Zhang Zhiqu himself reject them under the pretext of "denying reality is bureaucratism," but there was also someone who supported his erroneous remarks, and this person was Xu Daokuan, the head of the Yizheng County Committee's Cooperative Department. He said, "I have conducted several investigations into the lives of the peasants and held many forums. It is worth studying how much the lives of the peasants have improved. I think there has only been improvement in terms of daily necessities, and there has been no improvement in terms of grain. After collectivization, the lives of most peasants are lower than before collectivization, even worse than before liberation. In the past, there were many 'five workshops and one store' (referring to oil mills, grinding mills, distilleries, flour mills, tofu shops, and grocery stores) in the rural areas of Yizheng. Each household had four or five pigs, and they would eat six or seven meals a day when watering the fields. Now, they can't even get enough to eat, and they can't even eat tofu."

This head of the cooperative department even doubted the Party's collectivization policy. He said: "I have opinions about Chairman Mao's proposal for a high tide of collectivization. This statement is blind, and now it proves that the pace of collectivization has been too fast. Cadres cannot manage one household well, how can they manage hundreds of households?"

The erroneous thoughts of Comrades Zhang and Xu have a certain representativeness within the Party. The comrades of the Yangzhou Prefectural Committee who participated in the meeting convened a meeting of county committee secretaries from the entire prefecture to conduct a special study of their erroneous thoughts and launched a debate and reasoning struggle. Representatives from other prefectures also launched widespread criticisms of the erroneous thoughts of Zhang and Xu.

This debate further clarified the understanding of the following three questions among the cadres present: What is the rural situation after collectivization?

I. What is the rural situation in the countryside after collectivization? The rural situation is basically good. We are not in the wrong. As long as we rely on the majority of the masses and carry out a reasoning struggle against capitalist ideology, we can not only mobilize them but also achieve complete victory. Jiangpu County has recently launched a comprehensive socialist propaganda campaign. Liu Mingda, the Party Secretary of Baima Township in this county, used facts to illustrate that it is entirely possible to carry out a large-scale socialist debate in the countryside. In the previous period, the arrogance of the landlords and rich peasants in Baima Township was very rampant, spreading rumors and confusing the public, and provoking the relationship between the Party and the masses. A landlord in the fourth team of Mashan Cooperative said to the peasants, "How much rent did you pay me in the past? How much grain do you pay the Communist Party now! What did you eat when you worked in my house in the past? What do you eat now when you work for the cooperative!" The peasants immediately retorted him, "Paying rent in the past was being exploited, paying grain now is for ourselves. In the past, only three households out of the twenty-five households in our cooperative had land. The remaining twenty-two households cultivated the land of you landlords and were so exploited that they did not have enough food and clothing, and each person could only eat two to three hundred catties of grain. Now each person can eat 480 catties." This incident proves that the masses can see clearly the difference between the enemy and ourselves. Liu Jichuan, the Secretary of the Liuhe County Committee, said that the current grassroots cadres and masses in the countryside view the rural situation in these four sentences: "More and more people are actively running cooperatives (according to surveys, the vast majority of middle peasants and wealthy middle peasants also support running cooperatives); more and more people are becoming good at running cooperatives; the superiority of cooperatives is becoming more and more obvious, and production and life are getting better and better." Li Kui, the Party Secretary of Yiling District in Jiangdu County, which was previously known as "poor Yiling," listed materials to illustrate the comparison of production, life, and work before and after collectivization. In 1954, the unit area yield of the entire district was 296 catties, in 1955 it was 376 catties, in 1956 it was 360 catties, and this year it can be harvested at 400 catties. In the past, 30% of the people in Dachen Township ate vegetable roots in winter and "Guanyin powder" in the spring, but now each person eats an average of 400 catties of grain. The grain purchase work used to take five months to complete before collectivization, but this year the summer grain purchase in the entire district was completed in seven days. Shen Shouyu, the head of the Cooperative Department of Hanjiang County Committee, said that according to the survey of the Gongdao Town Agricultural Cooperative, in the past, poor peasants ate an average of only 200 catties of grain per person, and middle peasants ate 329 catties, but now they generally eat 420 catties. These facts prove that it is a blatant lie to say that the lives of the masses have not improved. As for saying that the lives of poor peasants after joining the cooperative are not as good as working in the landlord's house, it is even more baseless. Shen Shouyu used to work in the landlord's house for ten years, and he used his personal experience to explain that the life he lived at that time was simply the life of cattle and horses, which is truly like heaven and earth compared to the current life of poor peasants.

In the debate, the speakers unanimously agreed that after collectivization, production has developed, living standards have improved, and the consciousness of the masses has also improved. The vast majority of peasants are willing to take the socialist road, which is the basic aspect of the current rural situation. Was the pace of collectivization too fast?

II. Was the pace of collectivization too fast? Lian Yuanzhang, the Secretary of the Taixing County Committee, first criticized Xu Daokuan's erroneous view on this issue. He said: The fast speed of collectivization is not accidental. It has the urgent demands of the masses and the correct leadership of the Party. Collectivization has not experienced major deviations. The increase in production after collectivization is the best proof, and it cannot be said that the pace has been too fast. Of course, our cadres lack experience, we have not grasped socialist education firmly, and there are still many problems in management and operation, but these problems are being solved. The masses say that our cooperative this year has made five major progress compared to last year: ① The production arrangement is more reasonable, and the phenomenon of blindly changing systems has been reduced; ② Contracting work to groups and households has reduced the phenomenon of idling and wasting labor; ③ Grain is distributed as it is harvested, and there is no more moldy grain and rotten straw; ④ Accounts are straightened out and established, and the financial accounts are clear; ⑤ Cadres consult with the masses on matters, and there are no more forced orders. Chen Shimin, the Secretary of the Yizheng County Committee, also said: "The rural situation in our Yizheng County is not as bad as what Comrades Xu Daokuan and Zhang Zhiqu said. Generally speaking, the situation is good. Last year, we suffered a disaster and still achieved the normal annual output. After collectivization, more than 18,000 ponds and dams were built, and water conservancy disputes that could not be resolved in history were resolved. These are good deeds that the masses have unanimously praised. The masses sang: 'Pu Xin Zhou, nine out of ten years there is no harvest, organize and there is a harvest.' As for the fact that some people in the countryside want to withdraw from the cooperative, and some people shout that 'there is not enough grain to eat,' and shout that 'five workshops and one store' are not developing, that is mainly a matter of ideological understanding. Some people do not clearly understand the correct relationship between the individual and the cooperative, the cooperative and the country. Some people still miss the speculative tricks of capitalism. This just shows that we need to strengthen political and ideological work."

Standing Firm is the Key to Distinguishing Right from Wrong

III. What position to take when looking at problems is the key to distinguishing right from wrong. The reason why some leading cadres within the Party have misunderstandings and doubts about the rural situation is mainly because they have only listened to the words of a few wealthy middle peasants and have deviated from the correct class position. As Hong Jian, the Secretary of the Gaoyou County Committee, said: "To look at the rural situation, we must clearly stand on what position to look at it. If we stand on the fields of the majority of poor and lower-middle peasants to look at agricultural collectivization, then the superiority is very great. If we stand on the fields of a few wealthy middle peasants, we may not be able to see much superiority for the time being, but if we look at it with a developmental perspective, we can still see a lot of superiority." Xie Yilong, the Party Secretary of Gao You Wu An Township, also said with deep feeling: "In the past, when we heard someone say strange things, and someone called out for difficulties, we were frightened and settled the problems for those who made the most noise, or made promises casually. In the future, we must use a class viewpoint to identify what kind of people's opinions they are, whether they are the majority or the minority, whether they are reasonable or unreasonable, whether they can be resolved temporarily, and then deal with them separately."

Zhou Ze, the Secretary of the Yangzhou Prefectural Committee, said in the summary of the discussion: In the past, we often overestimated the wavering nature of wealthy middle peasants and underestimated the enthusiasm of the majority of peasants to resolutely take the socialist road. The biggest lesson that this study and discussion has given us is: We must believe in the majority of the masses and not underestimate their strength. Xiao Jiucheng, the Secretary of the Xinghua County Committee, said: "In the past, to carry out armed struggle, we had to have a firm position, a determination to move forward bravely, and courage. Today, we need the same to carry out socialism. Otherwise, we will not be able to pass this test of socialism."

After these debates and reasoning struggles, Comrades Xu Daokuan and Zhang Zhiqu have begun to admit their mistakes. Xu Daokuan also reviewed that 70% of the materials he investigated came from the opinions of middle peasants, some of which were the opinions of upper-middle peasants who had opened "five workshops and one store." All the comrades who attended the meeting felt that they had benefited a lot from this debate and believed that this was a vivid first lesson in self-education for cadres.

　　他们错在哪里？
　　记中共江苏省县委书记会议上对党内右倾思想的一场辩论
　　甄为民　薛金鳌
    在农村合作化以后的新形势面前，我们党的绝大多数农村领导干部都能够用正确的立场和观点，从现实事物的矛盾和发展中，辨明大是大非。但是，也有少数农村领导干部，为少数富裕中农的资本主义的叫嚣所迷惑，在两条道路的斗争依然存在的今天，迷失了方向，表现了严重的右倾思想和右倾情绪。对于党内右倾思想进行严肃认真的批判，以达到党内认识上的一致，是保证农村全民性的大辩论顺利开展的关键。在中共江苏省委最近为部署和讨论秋前以粮食问题为中心的农村社会主义教育而召开的县委书记会议上（包括各县县委合作部长和每县一个区委书记），就曾经发生这样一场批判党内右倾思想的大辩论。这场辩论是从仪征县委合作部长徐道宽和仪征大仪乡党委书记张志渠两同志在小组讨论中的发言引起的。在会议一开始讨论农村形势的时候，徐道宽和张志渠就发表了一系列错误的见解。张志渠认为：目前农村中要同（少数）富裕中农的资本主义思想进行说理斗争，是说不起来的。因为，“不关心集体利益是普遍现象”，只有少数干部在和富裕中农说理，是说不过他们的。张志渠还引证一些事实来证明自己的错误观点，他说：目前农村有80％的农民对现实不满，他们不满的实质是要求改善生活。有的贫农劳动一年，连口粮都拿不回来，说没有当雇工好。
    这位乡党委书记竟对党的依靠贫农团结中农的阶级政策发生了怀疑，他反映富裕中农的意见说：“建设社会主义依靠贫雇农是靠不住的。有些贫农整天要救济、贷款，说政府是老朋友，靠他们怎能把社会主义建设好呢？”
    张志渠的错误言论，在小组会上当时就受到江浦、邗江等县的几位代表的批判，可是，非但张志渠本人以“否认现实就是官僚主义”的借口加以拒绝，而且还有一个人支持他的错误言论，这个人就是仪征县委合作部长徐道宽。他说：“我对农民生活做过若干调查，开过多次座谈会。农民生活究竟改善多少值得研究。我看只是在日用品方面有改善，粮食方面没有改善。合作化以后，大部分农民生活比合作化以前低，甚至不如解放以前。过去仪征农村中“五坊一店”（指油坊、碾坊、糟坊、粉坊、豆腐坊和杂货店）很多，猪子每户四、五头，车水时一天要吃六、七顿，现在连粮食都吃不饱，豆腐也吃不到。”
    这位合作部长甚至对党的合作化政策也发生了怀疑。他说：“毛主席提出合作化高潮，我有意见，这句话有盲目性，现在证明合作化的步子跨快了。干部一家一户管不好，能管几百户吗？”
    张、徐二同志的错误思想在党内是有一定的代表性的。参加会议的扬州地委会的同志召开了全专区的县委书记会，对他们的错误思想作了专门研究，并开展了辩论和说理斗争。其他专区的代表也对张、徐二人的错误思想普遍展开了批判。
    这一辩论，在到会干部中进一步澄清了对以下三个问题的认识：合作化以后农村形势如何？
    一、合作化以后，农村形势如何？农村形势基本上是好的，我们并不理亏，只要我们依靠群众的大多数，向资本主义思想进行说理斗争，不仅可以发动起来，而且可以取得全胜。江浦县最近全面开展了社会主义宣传。这个县白马乡乡委书记刘明大用事实说明了目前在农村中开展社会主义大辩论是完全可能的：前一时期，白马乡的地主、富农的气焰很嚣张，造谣惑众，挑拨党与群众的关系。马山社四队有个地主对农民说：“过去你们缴我多少租？现在缴共产党多少粮啊！过去在我们家做工吃的什么？现在替社里做工吃的什么啊！”农民马上反驳了他：“过去缴租是受剥削，现在缴粮是为自己。过去，我们这个社二十五户人家，只有三户有田，其余二十二户种你们地主的地，被剥削得衣食不周，每人只能吃二三百斤粮。现在每人吃上四百八十斤。”这件事证明，群众对敌我是非是看得清楚的。六合县委书记刘济川说：目前农村基层干部和群众对农村形势看法是这样四句话：“积极办社的人越来越多（据调查绝大多数中农和富裕中农也拥护办社）；会办社的人也越过越多；合作社的优越性越来越明显，生产、生活也越过越好。”江都县过去称为“穷宜陵”的宜陵区区委书记李魁列举材料说明合作化前后生产、生活、工作的对比。这个区1954年全区单位面积产量是二百九十六斤，1955年三百七十六斤，1956年三百六十斤，今年可收四百斤。大陈乡过去30％的人冬天吃菜根，春天吃“观音粉”，现在每人平均吃粮四百斤；征购工作在合作化前要搞五个月才能完成，今年夏季征购全区七天就完成了。邗江县委合作部长沈寿余说：根据公道镇农业社的调查，过去贫农平均每人只吃粮二百斤，中农三百二十九斤，现在普遍吃到四百二十斤。这些事实证明，说群众生活没有改善，这是睁着眼睛说瞎话。至于说贫农入社后没有在地主家做工生活好，更是毫无根据。沈寿余过去在地主家做过十年工，他用亲身经历说明那时过的简直是牛马生活，与现在贫农生活比较，真是天上地下。
    在辩论中发言的人一致认为：合作化以后，生产有了发展，生活有了提高，群众觉悟也有了提高，绝大部分农民愿意走社会主义道路，这就是当前农村形势的基本方面。合作化的步子是不是跨快了？
    二、合作化的步子是不是跨快了？泰兴县委书记练元章首先批判了徐道宽对这个问题的错误看法。他说：合作化速度快并不是偶然的，有群众的迫切要求，有党的正确领导，合作化并没有发生大的偏差，合作化以后生产增加了，这就是最好的证明，不能说是步子跨快了。当然，我们干部经验不够，社会主义教育没抓紧，经营管理还有不少问题，但是这些问题正在得到解决。群众说我们今年办社比去年有了五大进步：①生产布置得合理了，盲目改制现象减少了；②包工到组到户，窝工浪工现象减少了；③粮食随打随分配，霉粮烂草现象没有了；④整账建账，财务账目清楚了；⑤干部有事和群众商量，强迫命令没有了。仪征县委书记陈士民也说：“我们仪征县农村情况，并不像徐道宽、张志渠两同志说的那样糟，总的说来，情况是好的。去年遭灾，还达到常年产量。合作化以后，兴修了一万八千多个塘坝，历史上无法解决的水利纠纷都解决了，这是群众有口皆碑的好事。群众歌颂说：“蒲新洲，十年九不收，组织起来有得收”。至于农村中有个别的人想退社，有些人叫喊“粮食不够吃”，叫喊“五坊一店”不发展，那主要是思想认识的问题。一些人认识不清个人和社、社和国家的正确关系，一些人还留恋资本主义的投机取巧。这正说明我们需要加强政治思想工作。
    站稳立场才能分清是非
    三、究竟站在什么立场去看问题，这是能否分清是非的关键。党内某些领导干部所以对农村形势产生误解和疑虑，主要是光听了少数富裕中农的话，离开了正确的阶级立场。正如高邮县委书记洪坚所说：“看农村形势，必须明确站在什么立场上去看，如果站在大多数贫农和下中农的田头上去看农业合作化，那优越性很大，如果站在少数富裕中农的田头上看，暂时也许看不出多少优越性，但假如用发展的眼光去看，还是可以看出很多优越性来的。”高邮武安乡党委书记谢义龙也深有同感地说：“过去我们听到有人说怪话，有人叫困难，就被吓唬住了，闹得凶的就给他解决问题，或者随便许愿。今后一定要用阶级观点，鉴别一下，看是什么人的意见，多数还是少数，合理不合理，暂时能不能够解决，然后分别处理。”
    扬州地委书记周泽同志在讨论小结时说：过去我们往往过高估计了富裕中农的动摇性，而过低估计了大多数农民坚决走社会主义道路的积极性。这次学习和讨论给我们最大的教育是：要相信群众的大多数，不要过低估计了群众的力量。兴化县委书记萧九成说：“过去搞武装斗争，要有坚定的立场、勇往直前的决心和勇气，今天搞社会主义同样需要这些，否则，社会主义这一关就过不去。”
    经过这些辩论和说理斗争，徐道宽、张志渠两同志已开始承认自己的错误，徐道宽并检讨了自己调查的材料70％是来自中农的意见，其中有些是开过“五坊一店”的上中农的意见。所有到会的同志，都认为在这次辩论中得益不少，认为这是干部进行自我教育的生动的第一课。
