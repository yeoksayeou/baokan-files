Xinhua News Agency, 7th: Mei Duo, a rightist element from Wenhui Daily, was further exposed at a symposium of all personnel held yesterday at the Beijing office of Wenhui Daily for his conspiracy to overthrow the Communist Party's leadership over the entire literary and art undertaking.

Mei Duo was the person in charge of cultural and artistic reporting at the Beijing office of Wenhui Daily. After the rectification campaign began, he used his position to collude with Liu Xi, a close friend of Chen Qixia, Ai Qing, an active supporter of the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique, Tang Qi and Lü Jian of "People's Literature," and Tang Yin and Tang Dacheng of "Literary Gazette," all rightists inside and outside the Party. He actively participated in their conspiracies and turned Wenhui Daily into their common anti-communist base, becoming a "popular figure" among rightists in literary and art circles for a time.

The meeting revealed that, in addition to plotting with Yao Fangzao, Liu Xi, Tang Qi, and Lü Jian to "attack the Writers Association" and publicly expose the Ding-Chen issue in the newspaper in order to reverse the verdict on the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique, Mei Duo also attempted to write articles to reverse the verdict on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.

On June 3rd of this year, Mei Duo, under the name of a commentator for Wenhui Daily, published an article in Wenhui Daily entitled "Opposing the Distortion of Chairman Mao's Speech on Literary and Art Issues," slandering the Communist Party's guiding ideology on literary and art issues in recent years as a "doctrinaire ideology" that distorted Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art. He spread rumors that this guiding ideology stifled the creative enthusiasm of writers. He opposed art serving politics, arguing that art serving politics was precisely the "important reason for the production of formulaic and conceptual works." He also promoted the view that literature and art could ignore reality and simply expose the so-called "dark side," so that literary and artistic works could become weapons to attack the Communist Party and socialism. Some people pointed out at the meeting that Mei Duo, in his article, had disguised himself as if he were a "defender" of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, and under this guise smuggled in anti-communist poison, which was very insidious in his intentions and methods.

When writing that article, Mei Duo had consulted with Tang Dacheng and others from Literary Gazette in advance to determine the main points of the article. After it was written, it was revised and supplemented by Tang and others. At the same time that Mei Duo published this article, Tang Dacheng also wrote an article of the same nature in Literary Gazette, and Mei Duo also pulled others to write similar articles in Wenhui Daily, launching an organized attack. In addition, Mei Duo and Tang Yin, Tang Dacheng, and others also planned to create a "coterie publication" without Party leadership, or to create a literary supplement in Wenhui Daily specifically for peddling their reactionary literary and artistic theories. Mei Duo, on behalf of Wenhui Daily, promised to give Tang Yin and others 200 yuan per month for editing fees, and advocated that Mei Duo himself should come forward to edit this supplement.

The meeting revealed that, in addition to colluding with Zhong Dianfei to launch an attack on the film industry in Wenhui Daily, Mei Duo also asked Tang Dacheng and others to write articles attacking the leaders of the Film Bureau during the blooming period. He asked another person from Literary Gazette to attack "China Film," and at Wu Zuguang's home, he and Tian Zhuang and other key members of the Wu Zuguang rightist anti-communist group signed a "contract" to write articles specifically attacking the Film Bureau. In addition, he also directed Yao Fangzao to conduct a malicious interview with Cai Chusheng, raising many provocative questions, but did not achieve his goal. In this way, they attempted to use a series of internal and external attacks to overthrow the Communist Party's leadership over the film industry.

After Mei Duo's anti-communist activities were exposed, he often boasted that he had "followed the Communist Party for many years" to conceal his motives for carrying out anti-communist conspiracies, and refused to make an honest confession. The materials revealed at today's meeting also exposed this mask of his. Mei Duo, who had joined the Communist Party in 1939, not only immediately betrayed and surrendered after being arrested by the Kuomintang in 1941, but also confessed five Communist Party members who were with him at the time to the enemy, becoming a shameful traitor who defected to the enemy and betrayed his comrades. Soon after, the Kuomintang prison management personnel slipped away due to Japanese aircraft bombing, and many of those imprisoned took the opportunity to escape, but Mei Duo not only did not escape, but instead mobilized another person to re-surrender to the enemy with him. Later, he actively participated in various activities organized by the enemy in the concentration camp, and was "rewarded" for it. After Mei Duo was released by the enemy in 1942, he maintained close contact with Hu Feng himself and many Hu Feng elements, praising each other until the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was smashed. He had consistently and actively promoted Hu Feng's reactionary literary and artistic ideas. And the reactionary literary and artistic theories that he used to attack the Party during this blooming period are still in line with Hu Feng's thinking.

Currently, the struggle between the Beijing office of Wenhui Daily and Mei Duo and other rightist elements is being further developed in depth.

### 妄图推翻共产党对整个文艺事业的领导  为丁陈反党集团和胡风反革命集团翻案  梅朵是文艺界右派的急先锋

    妄图推翻共产党对整个文艺事业的领导  为丁陈反党集团和胡风反革命集团翻案
    梅朵是文艺界右派的急先锋
    据新华社7日讯　文汇报右派分子梅朵妄图推翻共产党对整个文艺事业的领导的阴谋活动，在昨天文汇报北京办事处举行的全体人员座谈会上被进一步揭露。
    梅朵是文汇报北京办事处文化艺术报道的负责人。在整风开始后，他利用职务上的方便，与他的妻子姚芳藻一道，曾同陈企霞的密友柳溪，丁、陈反党集团的积极支持者艾青，“人民文学”的唐祈、吕剑，以及“文艺报”的唐因和唐达成等党内外右派分子相勾结，积极参加他们的阴谋活动，并把文汇报作为他们共同的反共基地，一时成为文艺界右派分子中的“红人”。
    会上揭露，梅朵除曾和姚芳藻一起同柳溪、唐祈和吕剑等密谋“攻开作协”，将丁、陈的问题在报纸上公开出来，为丁、陈反党集团翻案以外，还曾企图为胡风反革命集团做翻案文章。
    今年6月3日，梅朵以文汇报评论员的名义，在文汇报发表一篇题为“反对曲解毛主席对文艺问题的讲话”的文章，污蔑近几年来共产党对文艺问题的指导思想，是曲解了毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话的“教条主义思想”，造谣说，这种指导思想窒息了作家的创作热情；他反对艺术应为政治服务，主张艺术为政治服务，正是“产生公式化概念化作品的重要原因”；他还宣扬了文艺可以不顾现实而去单纯暴露所谓“阴暗面”的观点，以使文艺作品成为向共产党和社会主义进攻的武器。会上有人指出，梅朵在他的文章中曾把自己装扮成似乎是毛主席文艺思想的“捍卫者”，在这个幌子下偷运反共的毒草，其用心和手法是十分阴险的。
    梅朵在写那篇文章时，事先曾和文艺报的唐达成等人商量，确定文章的主要论点，写成后又曾经过唐等修改补充。在梅朵发表这篇文章的同时，唐达成也在文艺报写了一篇性质相同的文章，梅朵又拉了别人在文汇报上写了同样的文章，进行有组织的进攻。此外，梅朵和唐因、唐达成等还曾筹划创办一个不要党领导的“同人刊物”，或者在文汇报搞一个专门贩卖他们的反动文艺理论的文艺副刊。梅朵曾代表文汇报答应每月给唐因等二百元编辑费，并主张这个副刊由梅朵自己出面主编。
    会上揭露，梅朵除曾和姚芳藻共同勾结钟惦棐在文汇报上发起对电影界的进攻外，在鸣放期间，他还曾约唐达成等写文章攻击电影局的领导人，要文艺报的另一人攻击 “中国电影”，又在吴祖光的家里，与吴祖光右派反共集团的骨干分子田庄等人订立“合同”，约他们写专门进攻电影局的文章；此外，他还曾指使姚芳藻去对蔡楚生进行恶意的访问，提出许多挑拨性的问题，但没有达到目的，他们就这样企图以一系列的内外夹攻搞垮共产党对电影事业的领导。
    梅朵在他的反共活动被揭露后，还常吹嘘自己“多年来一直跟着共产党走”，掩饰他进行反共阴谋活动的动机，并拒绝作老实交代。今天会上揭露的材料也揭穿了他的这个假面具。曾经在1939年参加过共产党的梅朵，不但在1941年被国民党逮捕后当即变节自首，还曾向敌人供出五个当时和他在一起的共产党员，做了投敌叛党出卖同志的可耻叛徒。不久，国民党监狱管理人员因日本飞机轰炸而溜掉，许多被关押的人都乘机逃走，而梅朵不但不逃跑，反而动员另外一人和他一起再次投敌。后来，他还在集中营中积极参加敌人组织的各种活动，并因此而“受奖”。梅朵在1942年被敌人放出来后，就一直和胡风本人以及不少胡风分子来往密切，互相吹捧，直到胡风反革命集团被破获，他曾一贯地积极宣传胡风的反动文艺思想。而这次鸣放期间他用来向党进攻的反动文艺理论，仍然是与胡风的思想一脉相传的。
    现在，文汇报北京办事处和梅朵以及其他右派分子的斗争正在进一步深入展开。
