　　Carry the Struggle Between the Two Roads Through to the End

    The *Xinhua Daily* of Jiangsu published an editorial on September 9th entitled "Carry the Struggle Between the Two Roads Through to the End," discussing the issue of the democratic parties in the province striving to implement the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision. The following is a summary:

    The anti-Rightist struggle in Jiangsu Province's provincial-level agencies and universities has achieved a decisive victory after two months of arduous efforts.

    Judging from the large number of facts revealed in the anti-Rightist struggle of the democratic parties across the province, it fully proves that the road taken by the Rightists in the democratic parties is a capitalist road, essentially a return to a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society. The road that the Communist Party, the leftists of the democratic parties, and the broad masses of progressive elements in society insist on taking to the end is the road of socialism-communism. The two are fundamentally opposed.

    What are the main manifestations of the capitalist road taken by bourgeois Rightists? This can be explained from two aspects: the reactionism of the political direction and the reactionism of the organizational line. In terms of political direction, they tamper with the socialist political direction of the democratic parties, attempting to turn the democratic parties into tools for undermining socialism and restoring capitalism. They slander, vilify, and attack the Communist Party organizations at all levels, vainly hoping to replace them. In terms of organizational line, the key step for the Rightist backbone elements of the democratic parties to realize their political conspiracy is to control and usurp the leadership of the democratic party organizations. In order to expand their political capital, they openly undermine the policy of "combining consolidation and development" and unscrupulously engage in malignant "large-scale development."

    They use the name of "mutual supervision" to carry out "malicious attacks." They attack the Communist Party everywhere, saying that the Communist Party is an amateur in this and an amateur in that, that it is an amateur in all 360 trades. In short, wherever there is a Party organization or Party cadres, there is a thorn in the eyes of the Rightists.

    If their reactionary behavior is allowed to develop, it will ultimately ruin the foundation for the long-term coexistence of the democratic parties and the Communist Party. Some people believe that the democratic parties are still bourgeois parties today, and they cannot understand this. This is because they have not conducted a concrete analysis. Judging from the current situation of the democratic parties, that is, judging from their overall class basis, their main political tendencies, the influence of their historical origins, and the ideological systems of the vast majority of their members, the democratic parties are indeed still bourgeois parties and have not yet become true political forces serving socialism. Therefore, the democratic party organizations and their members must face reality squarely, must catch up quickly, carry out fundamental reforms, and carry out the essential transformation from bourgeois parties to socialist parties in order to adapt to the needs of the new socialist era. Some people think that the anti-Rightist struggle of more than two months has exposed a group of Rightists within the democratic parties, and the democratic parties have been discredited among the people. They feel that it is not honorable to participate in the democratic parties, or they feel that it has added a lot of trouble. They regret that they should not have joined the democratic parties in the first place, and even want to withdraw from the democratic parties. This view and idea are understandable, but they are incorrect and harmful to the current struggle. Those who have been discredited in the anti-Rightist struggle are the bourgeois Rightists, not the awakened middle elements who are increasingly turning to the left, let alone the leftists who firmly stand on the socialist position. All members of the democratic parties who support the leadership of the Communist Party and support socialism should never retreat, never protect themselves, and never be afraid of trouble at such a moment. Instead, they should, for the future of the great motherland and for the future of the democratic parties, bravely throw themselves into the struggle against the Rightists. In such a great struggle, pull the democratic parties back onto the socialist track, thoroughly transform the democratic parties politically and organizationally, and make them truly become political parties serving socialism; at the same time, exercise themselves, transform themselves, and improve themselves. This is a very good thing. Removing carbuncles and eliminating diseases for one's own organization is a meritorious service to socialism. This is very honorable. Now, the democratic parties are in a major historical period of fundamental transformation, and they should, from the very beginning, actively participate in the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, and carry the struggle between the two roads through to the end.

### 把两条道路的斗争进行到底

　　把两条道路的斗争进行到底
    江苏新华日报9月9日发表题为“把两条道路的斗争进行到底”的社论，谈该省民主党派力争实现长期共存互相监督方针问题。内容摘要如下：
    江苏省一级机关和高等学校的反右派斗争，经过过去两个月的艰苦努力，已经取得了决定性的胜利。
    从全省各民主党派反右派斗争所揭发出来的大量事实来看，完全证明各民主党派中的右派分子所走的道路，是一条资本主义道路，实质上是返回到半封建半殖民地的道路；共产党、各民主党派的左派以及社会上的广大进步分子，所坚持要走到底的道路，是社会主义——共产主义的道路，两者是根本对立的。
    资产阶级右派分子所走的资本主义道路的主要表现是什么？这可以从两方面来说，一是政治方向的反动性，一是组织路线的反动性。在政治方向上，他们篡改各民主党派的社会主义政治方向，妄图使民主党派成为破坏社会主义、恢复资本主义的工具，他们诬蔑、丑化和攻击各级共产党组织，妄想取而代之。在组织路线上，各民主党派的右派骨干为了实现他们的政治阴谋，首要一着，就是控制和篡夺各民主党派组织的领导权。他们为了扩大自己的政治资本，公开破坏“巩固和发展相结合”的方针，肆无忌惮的搞恶性“大发展”。
    他们借“互相监督”之名，行“恶意攻击”之实。他们到处攻击共产党，说共产党这样也是外行，那样也是外行，三百六十行，行行都是外行，总之，哪里有党组织有党员干部，就是哪里的右派分子眼中钉。
    他们的这种反动行为，如任其发展，最终一定要断送民主党派与共产党长期共存的基础。有些人认为民主党派搞到今天，还是资产阶级性的政党，思想上弄不大通。这是由于没有进行具体分析的原故；就各民主党派的现状来看，也就是就它的总的阶级基础来看，就它的主要的政治倾向来看，就它的历史根源的影响来看，就它的绝大多数成员的思想体系来看，各民主党派的确还是资产阶级性的政党，还没有成为真正的为社会主义服务的政治力量。因此各民主党派组织及其成员必须正视现实，必须急起直追，进行根本改造，进行由资产阶级政党到社会主义政党的本质改造，以适应社会主义新时代的需要。又有些人认为，两个多月的反右派斗争，各民主党派内部揭发出一批右派分子，民主党派在人民群众中被搞臭了，感到自己参加民主党派很不光采，或者感到增加了不少麻烦，懊悔当初不应该参加民主党派，甚至要退出民主党派；这种看法和想法是可以理解的，但又是不对的，也是对当前的斗争有害的。在反右派斗争中被搞臭的是资产阶级右派分子，而不是觉悟了的日益向左转的中间分子，更不是坚定地站稳社会主义立场的左派。凡是民主党派中拥护共产党领导，拥护社会主义的成员，在这样的时刻，决不应该退却，决不应该明哲保身，决不应该怕麻烦；而应该为了伟大祖国的未来，为了民主党派的未来，当仁不让，奋身投入反击右派的斗争。在这样的伟大斗争中，把民主党派重新拉回到社会主义轨道上来，彻底地从政治上组织上来改造民主党派，使它真正成为为社会主义服务的政党；同时锻炼自己，改造和提高自己。这是香得很的好事情。为自己的组织去痈除患，就是为社会主义立功。这是很光采的。现在各民主党派正处在进行根本改造的重大历史时期，就应该一本初衷，积极投入反右派斗争和整风运动，把两条道路的斗争进行到底。
