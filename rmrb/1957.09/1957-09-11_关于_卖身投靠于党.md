　　On "Selling Oneself to the Party"
　　Zhuang Nong
    "Selling oneself to the Party" is a malicious curse leveled at Communist Party members by rightists. This has aroused the anger of Communist Party members. Those who are angry are angry because they see that the aim of the slanderers is to alienate Party members from the Party, so that after the Party members are "independent," they can eliminate the Communist Party. This is, of course, a self-intoxicated dream of the rightists.

    For Communist Party members, there is no such thing as "selling oneself." "Dedicate everything to the Party!" This is what we solemnly declare when we join the Party. What we dedicate (not sell) is more than just "oneself"! In feudal society, "selling oneself into slavery" does not involve "selling" everything, because slaves are never willing to sell their hatred of feudal lords. As for those traitors who have historically recognized thieves as fathers and sold themselves for glory, "selling oneself" is only a means, and the purpose is still to "seek glory," which is even further from selling "everything." As for Communist Party members, for the sake of the people, for the sake of the Party and the great cause of communism, they truly want to dedicate everything they have, and countless Communist Party members have used their blood to explain this to the people. This is precisely our greatest glory!

    For Communist Party members, there is even less talk of "selling." The only most noble price for Communist Party members to join the Communist Party is: "To achieve the liberation of all mankind!" There is no other price besides this. We have never thought about demanding any price, nor do we want to obtain any personal gain from it. Therefore, when developing Communist Party members, we have never set up lavish banquets or paid travel expenses. If Party members holding certain work positions obtain some necessary means of subsistence, we are clear in our conscience about this. Those who should feel guilty are those rightists who take the people's money but do not sincerely work for the people, but instead painstakingly plot to oppose the people. Communist Party members should be proud and justified in being slandered as "selling themselves to the Party" because they are loyal to the Party!

    It cannot be said that there are no opportunists in our Party who have the idea of "selling themselves to the Party." But these people are not the ones the rightists want to scold; they are partners of the rightists within the Communist Party. Even on ordinary days, they always show a different position from the Party. Liu Binyan, who had been a Communist Party member for thirteen years, said: "I have never felt that the Party is my own." They harbor ulterior motives, and are not willing to dedicate everything, not even a hair. Because they joined the Party to seek their own interests, to do business. This is also a law: the more one thinks about "selling," the higher the price one tries to ask for, and the less one gives. In the history of the Party, there have been Chen Duxiu, Zhang Guotao, and many others, large and small, who betrayed the Party in times of crisis; among the current right-wing figureheads, some have also done this kind of "business." In this anti-rightist struggle, some people have also appeared in the Party: they saw some dark clouds over their heads, and a gust of evil wind blowing, and thought that their "backing was unstable" and that they had sold themselves to the wrong side, so they wore a bitter face and shouted "Party members also have their grievances," "I was used by the Party in the past," and then "stood up" and "rebelled," turning around to attack the Party. In fact, it is not that they really "understood" something, but just used this to brush on a layer of color that is convenient for "selling themselves" to another family.

    It is only beneficial for us that such people "stand out"; some of these people who have not had time to stand out should seriously consider: if they do not get rid of the idea of "selling themselves to the Party" (which also requires a thorough transformation), they will "stand out" sooner or later. Within our Party, such people are our heaviest burden, although we always try our best to save them before they "stand out."

    The slanderers will say: This is advocating blind obedience within the Party and protecting dogmatists. The answer is not necessarily. There are dogmatists in our Party, and these people also strive to dedicate "everything" to the Party, but they are far from doing it "completely." They have dedicated their bodies, but their brains are not dedicated enough, so they often unconsciously show phenomena that are contrary to the Party's requirements. The Communist Party requires Party members to dedicate "everything," which includes requiring Party members to overcome dogmatism. Although rightists also dislike dogmatists among Party members, they are actually not opposed to dogmatism, because they understand that by retaining dogmatism, it is much easier to attack the Party.

    Dogmatists, with the willingness to dedicate "everything," can gradually become a true Marxist and a good Communist Party member through serious efforts. Many people have come from this path. Being able to break free from the shackles of dogmatism and rise to the degree of completely dedicating oneself to the Party is a person's greatest glory and the greatest happiness in life.

### 关于“卖身投靠于党”

　　关于“卖身投靠于党”
　　庄农
    “卖身投靠于党”，是右派分子对共产党员的恶骂。这引起了共产党员们的愤怒。愤怒者之所以愤怒，是看穿了恶骂者意在把党员与党离间开来，使党员“独立”之后，来消灭共产党。这当然是右派分子们的一种自我陶醉的梦想。
    对于共产党员，本无所谓“卖身”。“把一切献给党”！ 是我们入党时就庄严地宣布过的。献（不是卖）出的岂止“一身”呢？封建社会里的“卖身为奴”，是谈不到“卖出”一切的，因为奴隶决不肯出卖他们对封建主的仇恨。至于历来那些认贼作父卖身求荣的败类们，“卖身”也只是一种手段，其目的还在“求荣”，那是更谈不到卖出“一切”的了。至于共产党员为了人民，为了党和共产主义的伟大事业，是真正要献出自己的一切的，无数共产党员用鲜血向人民说明了这一点。这正是我们的莫大光荣！
    对于共产党员，就更加谈不上“卖”。共产党员之要参加共产党只有一个最崇高的代价：“取得全人类的解放！”除此是再没有任何代价的。既没有想到过索取什么代价，也不要从中取得什么私人利益，因此在发展共产党员时，也就没有摆过什么丰盛的筵席，或者是付出过车马费之类。如果说，担任某种工作职务的党员，取得了一些必要的生活资料，对此，我们是问心无愧的。问心有愧的，倒是那些拿了人民的钱，不真心为人民办事，却还要处心积虑地来反对人民的右派分子们。共产党员由于忠实于党而被人诬蔑作“卖身投靠于党”，应该引以为荣，理直气壮！
    不能说，在我们党内，没有抱着“卖身投靠”想法的投机者。但是这些人，并不是右派分子所要骂的；而是右派分子在共产党内的伙伴。就是在平日，他们也总要表现出与党不同的立场。作过十三年共产党员的刘宾雁不就说：“我从来没有感觉到党是自己的。”他们怀揣二心，不仅不肯献出一切，就连毛发也是不肯轻易交出些许来的。因为他们入党就是想谋自己的利益，就是想作买卖。这也是一种定律：愈是想到“卖”，便愈是索尽量高的价，而尽量少的付出东西。在党的历史上出过陈独秀、张国焘以及大大小小的在紧急关头叛党的人；在现在的右派头面人物中，有些也曾是作过这种“买卖”的。这次反右派斗争中，党内又出现了这样一些人：他们看到头顶上有了一些乌云，眼前刮起了一阵邪风，便以为“靠山不稳”了，卖身卖错了，于是便一面苦丧着脸大叫“党员也有苦衷”，“我过去是被党利用了”，一面便“站出来”、“起义”，反过来向党进攻了。其实，并不是他们真的“弄明白”了一些什么，只是借此刷上一层便于向另一家“卖身”的色彩而已。
    这种人“站出去”了，对我们来说，只有好处；这种人中还有些未曾来得及站出去的，倒是值得他们好好考虑考虑：倘不去掉“卖身投靠”（也要脱胎换骨一番的）的想法，迟早也会“站出去”的。在我们党内来说，这种人是我们最沉重的包袱，虽然，在他们没有“站出去”以前，我们总是要尽量挽救他们的。
    恶骂者会说：这是提倡党内的盲目服从，保护教条主义者。答曰未必。我们党内是有教条主义者的，这种人也是力求把“一切”献给党的，但还远未作到“全部”。身是献出来了，但脑子还献的十分不够，因此还常常不自觉地表现出与党的要求相左的现象。共产党要求党员献出“一切”，是包括着要党员克服教条主义的。右派分子们虽也不喜欢党员中的教条主义者，但实际上却不是反对教条主义，因为他们明白，保留着教条主义，进攻起党来是要容易得多的。
    教条主义者，有了献出“一切”的意愿，经过严重的努力，是可以逐步成为一个真正的马克思主义者、一个好的共产党员的。许多人就是从这条道路上走过来的。能够解脱教条主义的束缚，升发到完全献身于党的程度，是人的莫大光荣，也是人生的莫大幸福。
