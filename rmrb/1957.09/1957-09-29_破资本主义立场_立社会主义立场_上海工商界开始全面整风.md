Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 28th - Shanghai's 200,000 industrialists and businesspeople have announced the start of a comprehensive rectification movement, including the anti-Rightist struggle.

On the 26th and 27th, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA) and the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce (FIC) jointly held a rally of 13,000 people, passing a resolution to launch a comprehensive rectification movement in industrial and commercial circles.

Sheng Peihua, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CDNCA and Chairman of the Shanghai FIC, pointed out in his opening speech that although capitalist ownership has been changed, most industrialists and businesspeople in Shanghai have not abandoned their capitalist standpoint. This contradiction between socio-economic status and political standpoint has become a serious problem in the political life of industrialists and businesspeople. He said that today, the capitalist standpoint has become a completely reactionary standpoint, and industrialists and businesspeople must resolutely abandon this standpoint and completely stand on the political standpoint of the working class. He called on all industrialists and businesspeople in the city to take immediate action, continue to exert the enthusiasm of the joint venture climax under the leadership of the Communist Party, actively participate in the rectification movement, and welcome a new high tide of socialist transformation.

At the meeting over these two days, Rong Yiren, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CDNCA and Vice Chairman of the Shanghai FIC, Hu Ziying, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai FIC, Yan Yaoqiu, a private-sector technician, Qian Xinyuan, a private-sector agent, and Shen Qingling, a family member of an industrialist and businessperson, and eight others spoke. They all used their personal experiences to illustrate the harm of capitalist ideology and political standpoint to the socialist cause and the necessity of the rectification movement.

Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended the conference on the 27th. He asked the people in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles not to have any concerns, to be determined to invest in the rectification movement, and the greater the determination, the smoother the transition to socialism. Cao Diqiu hoped that Shanghai industrialists and businesspeople would strive to pass the socialist test politically and ideologically, not only to pass the test themselves in the rectification, but also to help others pass the test well.

According to Shi Mukang, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CDNCA, in his report to the conference, Shanghai industrial and commercial circles will adopt the method of centralized rectification. The 6,000 people participating in the first batch of centralized rectification have already reported to the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Political School. They will adopt the method of helping each other and offering suggestions to each other, and carry out criticism and self-criticism in a gentle and kind manner; if any controversial issues are found, they will conduct a major debate in conjunction with the seven discussion topics proposed by Minister Li Weihan of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee. The 60,000 general industrialists and businesspeople and general CDNCA members will undergo rectification in batches after the first batch is completed. However, from now on, for about two weeks, they will listen to a report on rectification and the anti-Rightist struggle. The city's 130,000 small business owners will generally receive socialist education, and organize debates on certain fundamental issues as much as possible.

    破资本主义立场　立社会主义立场
    上海工商界开始全面整风
    新华社上海28日电　上海市二十万工商业者包括反右派斗争在内的全面整风运动宣告开始。
    26日和27日，民建上海市会员大会和市工商联会员代表大会联合举行了有一万三千人参加的誓师大会，通过了在工商界中展开全面整风运动的决议。
    民建市委主任委员、上海市工商联主任委员盛丕华在会上致开幕词中指出，资本主义所有制已经改变，但上海工商业者中多数人还没有抛弃资本主义立场。这种社会经济地位与政治立场不适应的矛盾，成了工商业者政治生活中的严重问题。他说，今天资本主义立场已成为完全反动的立场，工商业者必须坚决抛弃这种立场，完全站到工人阶级的政治立场上去。他号召全市工商业者立即行动起来，在共产党的领导下继续发挥合营高潮时的热情，积极投入整风运动，迎接社会主义改造的新高潮。
    在这两天的大会上，民建市委副主任委员、上海市工商联副主任委员荣毅仁，市工商联副主任委员胡子婴，私方技术人员颜耀秋，私方代理人钱欣元，工商界家属沈庆龄等十三人发了言。他们都以亲身体会，说明资本主义思想和政治立场对社会主义事业的危害和整风运动的必要。
    中共上海市委书记处书记曹荻秋27日出席了这次大会。他要求上海市工商界人士不要有任何顾虑，要下定决心投入整风运动，决心愈大，过社会主义关愈顺利。曹荻秋希望上海工商业者都要争取从政治上、思想上过好社会主义这一关，不仅自己要在整风中过关，也要很好地帮助别人过关。
    根据民建市委副主任委员史慕康在大会上的报告，上海工商界将采取集中整风的方法。参加第一批集中整风的六千人，已经向上海市工商界政治学校报到。他们将采取互相帮助、互相提意见的方式，和风细雨地开展批评与自我批评；发现有争论的问题，将结合中共中央统战部李维汉部长提出的七个讨论题目，进行大辩论。一般工商业者和一般民建会员六万人，将在第一批结束后分期分批地进行整风。但从现在起大约两周左右的时间，听取一次有关整风和反右派斗争的报告。全市十三万小业主将普遍进行社会主义教育，并尽可能地在某些根本问题上组织辩论。
