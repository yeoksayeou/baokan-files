　　What the Good Party Hates is What the Evil Party Likes
　　Li Rui is Full of Reactionary "Arrogant Bones"

　　(Our newspaper’s dispatch from Wuhan, September 17th) Li Rui, the vice chairman of the Wuhan branch of the Writers Association and deputy editor-in-chief of Changjiang Literature, who has always appeared to be "upright and honest," has been revealed by the masses during the anti-rightist struggle to be a two-faced individual, a careerist, and an anti-communist and anti-socialist rightist.
　　Rightist Li Rui distorted the fact that the Party's leadership only emphasizes politics and does not want the characteristics of literature and art. For several years, he has been seizing on this issue to attack the Party. Li Rui relentlessly attacked and distorted the policy of "serving workers and production" in Wuhan's worker literature and art in the early days of liberation. He believed that this was a "vulgar sociological theory" that ignored the characteristics of literature and art. Li Rui looked down upon the works of worker-peasant authors. He rejected all the works of worker-peasant authors published in Changjiang Literature as "mediocre and gray," "low level," and "formulaic and conceptual." At a forum discussing Wuhan's worker literature and art policy in 1953, Li Rui openly said: "The statement that literature and art serve whom is problematic. Literature and art simply serve people." He blatantly revealed that he was using opposition to vulgar sociology as a guise to fundamentally negate the role and significance of the worker literature and art policy.
　　In order to achieve his ambition of eliminating the Party's leadership over literature and art, Li Rui consistently adopted two-faced tactics. Among the masses, he disguised himself as someone who was being attacked, squeezed out, held a position without power, and persecuted. He deliberately distorted the disputes between Party members and him on literary and artistic issues and work matters as sectarian attacks and suppression against him. He maliciously divided the revolutionary ranks into two types: "arrogant bones" and "flattering bones." He praised the so-called spirit of "resisting superiors" and sympathized with the so-called "weak." He believed that Jiang Hong, a rightist who consistently opposed the Party, as well as those with anti-Party sentiments and dissatisfaction with the Party, possessed "arrogant bones" and a spirit of "resisting superiors." He regarded those who were criticized or disciplined by the organization, or who were investigated during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, as "weak" and showed them warmth and tried to win them over. He slandered Party members and Youth League members who were close to the Party and active elements as "flattering bones," "not vertebrates," and "fawning." When the Party criticized certain proud and complacent sentiments of a young Party member author, Li Rui provoked him in a consoling tone, saying: "You are a big tree that attracts the wind!" meaning that he was being envied by others. He also took issues that had been decided by the leading members after discussion and incited the masses to "go and make trouble with them (referring to the leaders)" and instructed them: "Don't say I told you this." Within the Writers Association branch, he invariably opposed and rejected anything that the Party leadership considered correct and should be adhered to, while he admired the opposite and took the opportunity to win people over and stir up trouble. Wherever there was an opportunity to undermine the unity between the Party and the masses and damage the Party's leadership prestige, Li Rui's arm would extend to that place. On the one hand, he used a mask of warmth and friendship to win over a portion of the people, and on the other hand, he tried his best to attack the Party leadership, describing the Party's leading comrades as uneducated, of low character, narrow-minded, and昏庸 [muddle headed].
　　Li Rui's two-faced tactics were manifested in all aspects. For several years, he had consistently expressed his eagerness to join the Party. In May of this year, when the Party branch of the Writers Association discussed his application to join the Party (which was not approved by the higher authorities) because it was deceived by his two-facedness, he said that entering the meeting room made him feel as excited as entering the Huairen Hall. However, during this period, he colluded with rightist writer Yao Xueyin and rightist Jiang Hong, among others, to launch a vicious attack on the Party by taking advantage of the Party's rectification campaign. He encouraged them to write a large number of sharp articles attacking the Party's literary and artistic leadership in Wuhan and submit them to Literary Gazette and Wenhui Daily for publication in order to create a situation of "internal and external attacks on the three majorisms in Wuhan." During the blooming and contending period, he thought that the Communist Party's situation was precarious, so he expressed that "under the infection and education of the masses," he had no choice but to "also prepare to roll up his sleeves, sweep away the twilight on his body, and join the battle." As soon as the anti-rightist struggle began, Li Rui immediately wrote an anti-rightist article, "Comparing," which was published in the Changjiang Daily, falsely praising how correct and great the Communist Party was. On the other hand, he used the favorable conditions of his full leadership over the editorial department of Changjiang Literature to continue to systematically organize a large number of articles attacking the Party and publish them in the miscellaneous essays, short essays, and literary essays columns of Changjiang Literature, directing the theoretical part of Changjiang Literature in a bourgeois direction and turning it into a tool for them to oppose the Party and socialism.
　　From July 9th to September 11th, over the past two months, after seventeen large and small meetings of the Writers Association branch and two literary and art conferences to expose and debate, Li Rui's rightist face has been completely exposed. However, Li Rui has never proactively confessed his problems but has instead been on the defensive at every step and resorted to all kinds of sophistry. Until the most recent meeting, in the face of a large number of facts revealed by the masses, he had no choice but to admit some problems, but he still avoided the important and dwelled on the trivial, and his confession was not at all profound.

### 好党之所恶　恶党之所好  李蕤一身都是反动的“傲骨”

　　好党之所恶　恶党之所好
　　李蕤一身都是反动的“傲骨”
    本报武汉17日电　一向是以“正直敦厚”面貌出现的作家协会武汉分会副主席、长江文艺副主编李蕤，在反右派斗争中，经过群众揭发，原来是一个长期耍着两面派手法的个人野心家，反共反社会主义的右派分子。
    右派分子李蕤歪曲说党的领导只强调政治，不要文艺特质。几年来一直抓住这个问题向党进攻。李蕤对解放初期武汉市提出来“为工人为生产服务”的工人文艺方针，进行了不遗余力的攻击和歪曲。他认为这就是忽视文艺特质的“庸俗社会学的理论”。李蕤非常看不起工农作者的作品，像发表在长江文艺上的工农作者的创作，他一律以“平庸灰色”“水平低”“公式化概念化”等加以排斥。在1953年讨论武汉市工人文艺方针的座谈会上，李蕤公然说：“文艺为什么人服务的提法成问题，文艺就是为人服务的。”，露骨地表明他借反对庸俗社会学为幌子，而企图根本否定工人文艺方针的作用和意义。
    为了达到取消党的文艺领导的野心，李蕤一贯采用了两面派手法。在群众中，他把自己装扮成受打击、排挤、有职无权受迫害的样子，他把党员与他在文艺问题上和工作上的争论，都故意歪曲为对他实行宗派主义的打击和压制。他恶意地把革命队伍分为“傲骨”和“媚骨”两种，他赞赏所谓“抗上”精神，同情所谓“弱小”。他认为一贯坚持反党的右派分子姜弘以及有反党情绪、对党不满分子具有“傲骨”、“抗上”精神，凡受组织批评处分，或肃反中受审查者，他都目之为“弱小”，而一一施以温情，加以拉拢。对于靠近党的党团员积极分子，则诬蔑为“媚骨”，“不是脊椎动物”“逢迎拍马”等。党内批评了一个党员青年作者的某些骄傲自满情绪，李蕤以安慰他的口气进行挑拨说：“你这个人树大招风呀！”意思就是说他遭到别人的忌恨了。他还拿那些经过领导成员讨论决定的问题去煽动群众起来“去和他们（指领导）闹”并嘱咐说：“别说这是我告诉你们的。”在作家协会分会内凡是党的领导认为正确的应该坚持的东西，他一概都在背地里竭力反对、排斥，反之则欣赏，并乘机进行拉拢、挑拨。只要那里有可以破坏党群团结，败坏党的领导威信的可乘之隙，李蕤的手臂就伸到那里。他一方面以温情、友谊的假面目拉拢一部分人，一方面即极力攻击党的领导，把党的领导同志都说成是不学无术、品质低劣、狭隘昏庸的人。
    李蕤的两面派手法表现在各个方面，他几年来始终表示迫切希望入党。今年5月份，作协分会党支部大会因受他两面派的蒙蔽，讨论他入党（上级未批准）时，他说他进入会议室就像进入怀仁堂一样使他振奋。可是就在这个时期，他却利用党整风的机会，勾结右派作家姚雪垠和右派分子姜弘等，向党进行了恶毒的进攻，他鼓动他们大量而尖锐地写文章攻击武汉党的文艺领导，投给文艺报、文汇报等发表，以便造成对“武汉三大主义的里外夹攻”的局势。在鸣放中，他以为共产党的形势已岌岌可危，于是表示“在群众的感染与教育下”，就不得不“也准备卷卷袖子，扫掉身上的暮气，而参加战斗了”。反右派斗争一开始，李蕤马上写了反右派的文章“比一比”在长江日报上发表，假意歌颂共产党如何正确伟大，另一方面，他却利用他全权领导长江文艺编辑部工作的有利条件，仍然有计划地组织大批向党进攻的文章，在长江文艺的杂文、短论及文艺笔谈等栏目内发表，将长江文艺的理论部分引向资产阶级方向，变成他们反党反社会主义的工具。
    自7月9日到9月11日两个月来，经过作协分会大小十七次会议和两天文艺界大会的揭发和辩论，李蕤的右派面目已完全暴露了，但李蕤对自己的问题始终没有主动交代，而是步步设防，百般狡赖。直到最近一次会议，在群众揭发的大量事实面前，他才不得不承认一些问题，但仍然是避重就轻极不深刻。
