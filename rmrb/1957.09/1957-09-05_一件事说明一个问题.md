    One Incident Explains a Problem
    Wu Tian
    Right-wingers say that "unified purchase and sales" has messed things up, and the peasants have nothing to eat at all. Is this really the case? Recently, I heard someone mention an incident that happened in the countryside, which can very well explain the problem.
    There were several households in a village who were short of grain. The government decided to provide relief to them, so they transported five hundred catties of grain by cart.
    Unexpectedly, this matter immediately spread throughout the village. As soon as the cart arrived at the village entrance, it was immediately surrounded by the women and old people who had stayed behind.
    They all said they were grain-deficient households and demanded to divide the several hundred catties of grain. They even wanted to take it away immediately.
    Of course, the cadres could not agree to this. After a long time, they finally persuaded them: to pull the grain to the village government, and everyone should send a few representatives to discuss it together.
    A total of twenty-five households claimed to be short of grain, and three representatives were elected. The village chief said to them:
    "If the twenty-five households divide it equally, each household can only get twenty catties of grain. In this way, the real grain-deficient households cannot solve the problem, so what should we do?"
    So the representatives discussed it, and everyone believed that some families were not short of grain, and there were not many truly grain-deficient households. But who are the truly grain-deficient households?
    Finally, one representative suggested searching each house, since the women in charge of the households were all here, and whoever didn't have time to hide the grain could be found out immediately.
    The idea was proposed by the masses themselves, and the masses themselves did it. So the representative announced this method to everyone and said that everyone should supervise the search from house to house.
    As soon as this method was announced, a woman immediately ran away. When someone stopped her, she said:
    "I want to go back to breastfeed the child, why are you stopping me?" She ran as she spoke.
    Then another old woman said:
    "It's time, I should go back to cook." She also left as she spoke.
    The third one to leave was an old man, who said he was going to find his child at the entrance of the village. Then the fourth, the fifth...
    In this way, more than a dozen households left one after another, and several more people left when they were about to set off. In the end, only five households remained, and they never left.
    There was no need to search them, they were the real grain-deficient households, and the five hundred catties of grain were distributed to them.
    What does this incident illustrate? Some people who have just gone to the countryside may hear some farmers shouting "not enough to eat," but if you go into depth to understand, the facts are not entirely like that.
    Are right-wingers trying to confuse the public?

    一件事说明一个问题
    吴天
    右派分子说“统购统销”搞糟了，农民全都没有吃的了，真是这样吗？最近我听见有人说起农村里发生的一件事，很能说明问题。
    有一个村子里有几户缺粮，政府决定救济他们，于是用大车运来五百斤粮。
    不想这件事马上传遍了全村，等大车一到村口，立刻就被留在家里的妇女和老人们包围起来。
    他们都说自己是缺粮户，要求分这几百斤粮。甚至就想马上拿走。
    当然，干部们是不能同意这么做的，搞了好半天，总算把他们劝说好了：把粮食拉到村政府，大家推派几个代表一齐来商量。
    自称缺粮的一共是二十五户，选了三个代表。村长对他们说：
    “如果二十五户平均分配，每户只能分到二十斤粮，这样，真正缺粮户解决不了问题，可怎么办？”
    于是代表们合计开了，大家认为有些人家并不缺粮，真正的缺粮户并不多。可是谁又是真正的缺粮户呢？
    最后有一个代表提议到各家搜查一下，好在管家的妇女都在这儿，粮食谁来不及收藏，马上就可以搞出一个究竟。
    主意是群众自己提的，也由群众自己做，于是代表向大家宣布了这个办法，并且说要大家监督着一户挨一户查。
    这个办法刚一说完，马上就有一个妇女拔脚飞跑，当有人阻拦她的时候，她说：
    “我要回去奶孩子，你们干吗阻拦我呢？”她说着说着跑了。
    接着又有一个大娘说：
    “到时候了，我该回去做饭去。”她说着说着也走了。
    第三个要走的是老大爷，他说他要到村口去找他的小孩。于是第四个，第五个……。
    这样，接二连三地走掉了十几户，等到真要出发时又走了几个人，最后只剩了五户，他们一直没有离开。
    这就不用去查了，他们是真正的缺粮户，五百斤粮食分给了他们。
    这件事说明了什么呢？有些人刚下农村，很可能听到一些农民喊“不够吃”，但是如果深入了解，事实便不完全是那样了。
    右派分子企图混淆视听，行吗？
