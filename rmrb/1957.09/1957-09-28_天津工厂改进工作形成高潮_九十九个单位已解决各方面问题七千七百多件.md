Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 26th. Following the high tide of "Great Blooming and Great Contention" among workers in Tianjin factories and enterprises, a mass movement for improving work has begun to emerge. As of the 24th, according to statistics from ninety-nine units in the industrial and transportation sectors, leaders and the masses of workers have worked together to solve more than seven thousand seven hundred problems related to production management, welfare, and the work style of cadres.

    For example, Wang Guilin, a pump worker at the Tianjin Paper Mill, suggested installing a mixer, which could save more than 10,000 yuan per year. This suggestion has been immediately adopted by the leadership. Workers at Yongming Paint Industrial Company pointed out that one workshop was affecting the technical research work of the central laboratory and the production of the workshop because it lacked a laboratory. This problem has also been quickly resolved with the personal participation of the factory director. In the past, workers in the fourth workshop of the Rubber Sundries Factory produced in the open air, which was inconvenient whenever it was windy or rainy. Recently, the leadership has erected a shed based on the workers' opinions. Workers in the Third Motor Vehicle Team of the Tianjin Transportation Company ate cold food on the night shift and had no recreational activities after work. After the workers made their suggestions, the leaders of the motor vehicle team, in accordance with the spirit of "running enterprises diligently and thriftily," immediately installed a pipe on the large boiler connected to a large box to heat food for the workers and actively sought to establish a club.

    The masses of workers are satisfied with the leadership's implementation of the spirit of rectifying while correcting. After the leaders of the Tianjin Engineering Machinery Factory posted big-character posters about improving work, an old worker composed a clapper rhyme saying: "One poster (referring to the big-character posters posted by the workers) answers another (the factory director posted big-character posters about improving work), the factory director really supports us, mistakes are corrected immediately, and the morale of the masses is high."

    天津工厂改进工作形成高潮
    九十九个单位已解决各方面问题七千七百多件
    新华社天津26日电　天津市工厂企业在职工大鸣大放高潮以后，又开始出现一个群众性的改进工作的高潮。到24日止，据工业、交通部门九十九个单位统计，领导人员和职工群众一齐动手，已经解决了有关生产管理、生活福利、干部作风等方面的问题七千七百多件。
    例如天津造纸总厂司泵工人王桂林建议安装一架搅拌机，这样每年可以节约一万多元。这个建议已被领导方面立即采纳。永明油漆工业公司职工提出，有一个车间因为没有试验室，影响到中央试验室的技术研究工作和车间的生产。这个问题在厂长亲自参加下，也已经迅速解决了。橡胶杂品厂第四车间工人过去在露天生产，每当刮风下雨，工作不便，最近领导方面根据工人意见已经搭起了罩棚。天津市运输公司第三汽车队工人夜班吃冷饭，下班后没有文娱活动。工人提出意见以后，汽车队的领导方面根据“勤俭办企业”的精神，立即在大锅炉上安装一条管子通到大箱里给工人热饭，并且积极设法成立俱乐部。
    职工群众对于领导方面贯彻边整边改的精神感到满意。天津市工程机械厂领导方面贴出改进工作的大字报以后，一个老工人编了快板说：“一报（指职工贴的大字报）还一报（厂长贴出改进工作的大字报），厂长真撑腰，有错马上改，群众情绪高”。
