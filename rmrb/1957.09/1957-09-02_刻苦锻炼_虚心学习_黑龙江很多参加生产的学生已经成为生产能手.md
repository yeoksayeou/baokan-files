Xinhua News Agency report: According to incomplete statistics from the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Education: Since the founding of the country, more than 530,000 middle and primary school graduates in the province have participated in labor production, 80% of whom have participated in agricultural production. More than 16,000 middle and primary school graduates in the province who could not continue their education this year have also participated in agricultural production.

These graduates have worked hard and learned modestly in their labor production over the past few years, and now many of them have become outstanding production experts, loved by the masses. Some have even been elected as directors of agricultural cooperatives, production team leaders, and other positions. Dong Jie, a student who graduated from higher primary school four years ago, is now the director of the Xi'an Cooperative in Juren Township, Bin County. At first, he had no understanding of agricultural production and wanted to leave the countryside. Later, under the education of the Party and Youth League organizations, he realized the great significance of participating in agricultural production and resolutely participated in production, regardless of family opposition and outside ridicule. Because he has always been active and willing to work in production and literacy work, he has been praised by the masses.

Many others have applied the knowledge they learned in the past to practical production. Wang Tianmin, a high school graduate from Yilan County, is now a technician at the Communist Youth League Collective Farm. Last spring, when the farm was first established on a complex grassland terrain, he used his knowledge of trigonometry and geometry to create a "surveying instrument," which solved the difficulties of land surveying and land planning in wasteland reclamation. Tian Xinhua, a graduate of higher primary school in Luobei County, also used the principles of physics to create the "Xinhua Low-Speed Type 6 Wind Turbine," which can drive three stone mills without livestock, solving the problem of insufficient animal power. These creations have been widely valued by the masses.

    刻苦锻炼  虚心学习
    黑龙江很多参加生产的学生已经成为生产能手
    据新华社讯  据黑龙江省教育厅不完全统计：从建国到现在全省已有五十三万多中、小学毕业生参加劳动生产，其中80％参加了农业生产。全省今年不能升学的中、小学毕业生，也已有一万六千多人参加了农业生产。
    这些毕业生在几年来的劳动生产中，刻苦锻炼，虚心学习，现在很多人都成了出色的生产能手，受到广大群众爱戴，有的还被选为农业社主任、生产队长等职务。四年前高小毕业的学生董杰，现在是宾县居仁乡西安社的社主任，开始他对农业生产没有认识，想离开农村，后来在党团组织教育下，认识到参加农业生产的重大意义，就不顾家庭阻挠和外人嘲笑，坚决参加生产。由于他在生产上和扫盲工作上一贯积极肯干，受到群众表扬。
    还有许多人把他们过去学的知识运用在实际生产上。依兰县高中毕业生王天敏，现在是共青集体农庄的技术员，去年春天农庄刚在地形复杂的草原上建立时，他利用了在三角、几何学方面的知识创造了“测绘仪”，因此解决了荒原垦荒土地丈量和土地规划的困难。萝北县高小毕业生田新华，还利用物理学原理创造了“新华低速六型风力发动机”，它不用牲畜可以带动三盘石磨，解决了畜力不足的困难。这些创造，都受到群众普遍重视。
