    Qualified Products Treated as Scrap
    Our factory recently treated a batch of qualified products as scrap.
    The course of events was as follows: In the third and fourth quarters of last year, when raw material supply was tight, our factory overcame difficulties and completed the order for 266 rolled iron rollers for the Shanghai State-owned Xinhu Steel Plant. However, when it came time for delivery, Xinhu Plant, due to its own technical design errors, needed a different specification of product and used the excuse of unqualified quality to refuse to accept the goods. After inspection by the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company Central Laboratory, the quality was proven to meet the requirements. However, Xinhu Plant still did not change its attitude, but instead notified our factory to cancel the contract. After many negotiations, and with the approval of the Shanghai Casting and Forging Industry Company, our factory treated this batch of qualified products as scrap, causing a national loss of more than 40,000 yuan.
    We do not agree with this practice of wasting state property.

### 合格产品被当成了废品

    合格产品被当成了废品
    我们厂最近把一批合格产品当废品处理了。
    事情的经过是这样的：去年三、四季度，正当原材料供应紧张的时候，我们厂克服困难，完成了上海国营新沪钢厂的订购任务——轧铁辊二百六十六根。但是，到交货的时候，新沪厂因为自己技术设计上的错误，需要另一种规格的产品，便借口质量不合格，拒绝收货。后经上海钢铁公司中心试验室检验，证明质量符合要求，但是新沪厂仍不改变态度，反而通知我厂要注消合同。经过多次交涉，最后经上海市铸锻工业公司核准，我们厂里把这批合格产品当废品处理了，使国家损失四万多元。
    我们不同意这种浪费国家财产的作法。
