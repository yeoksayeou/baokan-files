    Counterattack the Rightists, Do Not Forget Rectification and Improvement Simultaneously

    We cannot, because of the erroneous statements of the rightists, set aside all the suggestions for improving work put forward by the broad masses with the good intention of helping the Party's rectification, and leave them unaddressed. Indeed, in the early stages of the rectification campaign, rightists, under the guise of helping the Party's rectification, spread many anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies. Precisely because of this, we launched a struggle against the rightists, deeply criticizing and thoroughly shattering those fallacies in the struggle, in order to distinguish between major rights and wrongs. We must never confuse the well-intentioned criticisms of the broad masses with the malicious attacks of the rightists, let alone relax the improvement of work under the pretext of counterattacking the rightists. If we do so, it will violate the principle of rectification and improvement simultaneously, fail to achieve the purpose of rectification, and play right into the hands of the rightists. We must recognize that the opinions put forward by the broad masses are mostly out of good intentions, and the vast majority of them are correct, or partially correct. We should immediately and seriously analyze and study these opinions, and handle them seriously. Whatever is reasonable and feasible should be done immediately; although reasonable, but involving a wider range of issues and difficult to solve for the time being, or the nature of the problem is more complex and difficult to determine whether it is correct, we should assign special personnel to study it carefully and explain it clearly to the masses; for some opinions that are obviously wrong because the people who put forward the opinions do not know enough about the situation, we must also patiently explain.

专栏：报刊论文摘要

    反击右派勿忘边整边改
    我们不能因为出现了右派分子的错误言论，就把广大群众基于帮助党整风的善良愿望而提出的改进工作的意见，一概搁置一旁，不加处理。的确，右派分子在整风初期，曾经借帮助党整风为名，散布了很多反党、反社会主义的谬论。正因为这样，我们才展开了对右派分子的斗争，在斗争中对那些谬论，深入批判，彻底粉碎，以求明辨大是大非。我们决不能把广大群众的善意批评和右派分子的恶毒攻击混为一谈，更不能借口反击右派分子而放松了改进工作。如果这样，那就违反了边整边改的原则，达不到整风的目的，而且正中了右派分子的奸计。我们必须认识广大群众提出的意见大都是从善意出发的，其中绝大多数是正确的，或者部分正确的。对于这些意见，我们应该立即认真分析研究，严肃处理。凡是合理而又可行的，应当马上就办；虽然合理但因牵涉较广，一时不易解决的，或者问题性质比较复杂，难以肯定是否正确的，都应一面指定专人认真研究，一面向群众解释清楚；对于一些由于提意见的人对情况了解不够，所提意见显然是错误的，也要耐心说明。（摘自9月5日大公报社论：“反击右派勿忘边整边改”）
