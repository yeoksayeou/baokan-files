Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 5th. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting on the 4th to examine the current situation of capital construction in the Autonomous Region and determined measures to ensure project quality and accelerate construction progress.

This year, the capital construction tasks in Inner Mongolia are more arduous than in any previous year: the number of structurally complex projects has increased; China's new iron and steel industry base has begun construction in Baotou, and various affiliated enterprises and municipal construction surrounding it have entered a stage of intense construction; the Baolan, Bao (tou)-Bai (yunebo) and Baotou ring railways are under vigorous construction; in the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area, two new timber harvesting bases will be built, and new railways and highways for transporting timber will be constructed; the capital of the Autonomous Region - Hohhot City will not only build and expand industrial enterprises such as wool textile factories and licorice factories, but also build large-scale scientific research institutions such as Inner Mongolia University, the Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science, and the Institute of Traditional Mongolian and Chinese Medicine.

Due to the late issuance of project tasks and the general sense of relaxation among basic construction departments and construction units at the beginning of this year, such as "this year's basic construction task is small, the force is large, and there is not enough to eat," leadership over design and construction preparation work was relaxed, thus delaying the start date, so that most projects only started after July. According to statistics from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Branch of the People's Construction Bank of China: by the end of July, only 31.1% of the annual plan had been completed by the 157 key construction units in the region. It is estimated that Baotou and Hohhot will only complete about 50% of the annual plan by the end of August.

Based on the above situation, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that whether the Autonomous Region's capital construction can be completed this year is related to the successful completion of the country's first five-year plan and the preparatory work for the second five-year plan, and will also directly affect the development of the Autonomous Region's economic and cultural undertakings and the improvement of the lives of all ethnic groups. Therefore, it is necessary to take active measures to accelerate construction progress while ensuring quality, and strive to complete this year's capital construction tasks on schedule.

The Inner Mongolia Party Committee requires all basic construction departments to conduct another comprehensive review of all projects, understand the situation, and make reasonable arrangements. For projects that must be completed this year, construction must be expedited to ensure completion before the ground freezes. During construction, key projects must be interspersed with general projects. At the same time, it is required to vigorously promote advanced construction methods and, according to needs and possibilities, adopt methods such as double shifts and weekly rotation systems to accelerate project progress. Projects that are definitely impossible to complete this year should be properly arranged for planned cross-year construction.

The Inner Mongolia Party Committee pointed out that after various places have generally entered a stage of intensive construction, the important issue currently to speed up project progress is to do a good job in on-site construction organization. Therefore, leading cadres at all levels are required to go deep into construction sites to strengthen on-site management; the person in charge of Party A must also personally go to the site to cooperate and coordinate and solve temporary problems that occur on-site in a timely manner.

The Inner Mongolia Party Committee pointed out that only by avoiding project accidents can construction work advance rapidly. Therefore, during the intensive construction process, it is necessary to prevent in advance the possible emergence of adverse tendencies such as neglecting quality and safety.

The meeting also made a special study of the shortage of labor and certain equipment. The meeting believes that based on the current manpower and material resources of the Autonomous Region, as long as the relevant departments strengthen cooperation and exchange what they have for what they need, this problem can basically be solved.

### 领导干部要深入工地加强现场管理  内蒙古党委确定保证工程质量加快工程进度的措施

    领导干部要深入工地加强现场管理
    内蒙古党委确定保证工程质量加快工程进度的措施
    新华社呼和浩特5日电　中共内蒙古自治区委员会4日召开会议检查了当前自治区基本建设情况，并且确定了保证工程质量、加快施工进度的措施。
    今年内蒙古地区基本建设任务比以往任何一年都繁重：结构复杂的工程项目增加了；我国新的钢铁工业基地开始在包头动工兴建，围绕着它的各种附属企业和市政建设已进入紧张的施工阶段；包兰、包（头）白（云鄂博）和包头环城铁路线，正在大力进行施工；在大兴安岭林区，将新建两个木材采伐基地，修建新的运输木材的铁路和公路线；自治区的首府——呼和浩特市不仅要新建和扩建毛织厂、甘草厂等工业企业，还要建筑规模很大的内蒙古大学、畜牧兽医科学研究所、中蒙医研究所等科学研究机构。
    由于工程任务下达较晚和基本建设主管部门、施工单位在今年年初普遍存在着“今年基本建设任务小、力量大、吃不饱”等松劲情绪，放松了对设计和施工准备工作的领导，因而延迟了开工日期，使得大部分工程项目在7月以后才开始动工。据中国人民建设银行内蒙古自治区区行统计：全区一百五十七个重点建设单位，到7月底只完成年计划31.1％。包头和呼和浩特二市，预计到8月底也只能完成年计划50％左右。
    根据以上的情况，中共内蒙古自治区委员会认为，今年自治区基本建设能否完成，关系到国家第一个五年计划的胜利完成和第二个五年计划的准备工作，同时也将直接影响自治区经济文化事业的发展和各族人民生活的改善。因此，必须采取积极措施，在保证质量的前提下，加速施工进度，争取按期完成今年的基本建设任务。
    内蒙古党委要求各基本建设主管部门对全部工程项目再进行一次全面的排队，摸清情况，进行合理的安排。对今年必须完工的工程项目，要抓紧施工，保证在结冻前完成。在施工中必须将重点工程同一般工程穿插进行。同时，要求大力推行先进的施工方法，根据需要和可能采用双班制、星期轮休制等办法，以加速工程进度。对今年肯定完不成的工程，应作妥善安排，作到有计划地跨年度施工。
    内蒙古党委指出，各地普遍进入紧张施工阶段以后，目前加快工程进度的重要问题，是作好现场的施工组织工作。因此，要求各级领导干部深入工地，以加强现场的管理工作；甲方负责人也要亲临现场协作配合，及时解决现场中临时发生的问题。
    内蒙古党委指出，只有避免了工程事故，施工工作才能够迅速前进。因此，必须在紧张施工过程中，预先防止可能出现的忽视质量和忽视安全等不良倾向。
    会上还就劳动力和某些器材不足的问题作了专门研究。会议认为根据目前自治区的人力和物力，只要各有关部门加强协作，互通有无，这个问题基本上可以得到解决。
