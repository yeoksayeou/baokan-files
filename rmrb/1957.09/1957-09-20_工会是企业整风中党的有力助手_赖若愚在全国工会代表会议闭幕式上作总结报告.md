Xinhua News Agency, September 19th: Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, stated in his summary report at the closing ceremony of the National Trade Union Delegates Conference today that in the enterprise rectification and socialist education movement, the trade union should act as the Party's powerful assistant. At the same time, on the basis of rectification, it should improve trade union work and welcome the new high tide of production and construction that may emerge after the rectification.

    This conference opened on the 16th. The main task of the conference was to prepare for the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, and to study the rectification movement in enterprises and further promote the campaign to increase production and practice economy.

    In his report, Lai Ruoyu said that the current rectification movement in factories and mines is a glorious page in the history of the workers' movement, and the trade union must do a good job in various specific organizational tasks. In addition to paying attention to the use of important rectification methods such as big-character posters, forums, and debates, it is necessary to focus on trade union group meetings and employee representative conferences to boldly mobilize the masses. At the beginning of the rectification, the trade union should mobilize the masses to speak out freely and organize them to conduct debates. For the opinions raised by the masses, the trade union should assist the administration in resolving them on the one hand, and must understand and study them from the perspective of the workers' movement on the other. In the later stage of rectification, the trade union must address the opinions raised by the masses and focus on improving its work.

    Lai Ruoyu pointed out that many of the opinions raised by the workers in the enterprise rectification movement are related to production, especially in factories and mines with a large number of veteran workers. We must seize these issues and organize employees to discuss them in the later stage of rectification, which will promote the arrival of a high tide of production and construction.

    Lai Ruoyu also talked about several issues that should be paid attention to after the arrival of a new high tide of production and construction: (1) Continue to strengthen education for employees on building the country diligently and frugally, running enterprises diligently and frugally, and fostering a spirit of hard work and plain living to overcome difficulties; (2) Emphasize unity and cooperation between technical personnel and workers, and between new and old workers; (3) Strengthen labor discipline; (4) Pay attention to labor protection and product quality.

    Lai Ruoyu said that the general slogan that should be emphasized in organizing employees to launch socialist competitions to welcome the new high tide of production and construction is still "help each other, learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths, and improve together."

    Lai Ruoyu pointed out that trade union organizations must grasp the following principles when handling and solving employee livelihood issues: (1) Proceed from the perspective of 600 million people; (2) Spend less money and accomplish more; (3) Try to organize and use the power of the masses to solve their own immediate livelihood and welfare problems; (4) Livelihood and welfare work must be closely integrated with political and ideological education work.

　　工会是企业整风中党的有力助手
　　赖若愚在全国工会代表会议闭幕式上作总结报告
    据新华社19日讯　中华全国总工会主席赖若愚在今天闭幕的全国工会代表会议上作总结报告中说，在企业进行整风和社会主义教育运动中，工会应该作为党的有力助手，同时要在整风的基础上，改进工会工作，迎接整风以后可能出现的生产建设新高潮。
    这次会议在16日开幕。会议的主要任务是为中国工会第八次全国代表大会进行准备，同时研究企业中的整风运动和进一步开展增产节约运动。
    赖若愚在报告中说，这次厂矿企业的整风运动是工人运动史上光荣的一页，工会必须作好各种具体的组织工作。除了注意运用大字报、座谈会、辩论会等整风的重要方式以外，要特别抓紧工会小组会和职工代表大会，放手发动群众。在整风开始时，工会要动员群众大鸣大放，组织群众进行辩论，对于群众提出的意见，工会应该一方面协助行政加以解决，一方面必须从工人运动的角度进行了解研究。在整风后期，工会必须针对群众提出的意见，抓紧改进工作。
    赖若愚指出，目前在企业整风运动中工人群众所提的意见，很多是属于生产方面的，特别是在老工人多的厂矿。我们要抓住这些问题，在整风后期组织职工进行讨论，这样就会促进生产建设高潮的到来。
    赖若愚还谈到了在新的生产建设高潮来到以后应注意的几个问题：（1）对职工群众仍要加强勤俭建国、勤俭办企业和艰苦朴素、克服困难的教育；（2）要强调技术人员和工人、新工人和老工人之间的团结合作；（3）加强劳动纪律；（4）注意劳动保护和产品质量。
    赖若愚说，在迎接生产建设新高潮组织职工开展社会主义竞赛中应该强调的总的口号，仍旧是“互相帮助，互相学习，取长补短，共同提高”。
   赖若愚指出，工会组织在处理和解决职工生活问题时，必须掌握下列几个原则：（1）从六亿人口出发；（2）少花钱，多办事；（3）尽量组织和运用群众的力量，解决群众自己的切身生活福利问题；（4）生活福利工作必须和政治思想教育工作密切结合。
