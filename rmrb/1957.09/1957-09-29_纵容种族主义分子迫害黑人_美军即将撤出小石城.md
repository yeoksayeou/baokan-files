Xinhua News Agency, September 28th, Washington Dispatch: A mere three days after the deployment of federal troops to Little Rock, Arkansas, in response to escalating riots by racists, the U.S. government has openly conceded to Southern racists. Defense Secretary Wilson hinted on the 27th that troops would soon be withdrawn, stating he hoped federal troops would not need to linger in Little Rock much longer. Simultaneously, newspapers report the U.S. government has agreed to discuss the Southern governors' proposal to withdraw the recently deployed troops.

This attitude of the U.S. government fully illustrates that the decision to send federal troops to Little Rock was not to genuinely protect the rights of Black people, but to deflect protests and condemnations from the public, both at home and abroad, regarding the atrocities of American racists and the U.S. government's indifference.

The fact that the American Broadcasting and Television Company deliberately provided Arkansas Governor Faubus, a notorious Southern racist agitator, with a broad platform on the 26th further confirms the extent of appeasement and indulgence towards racists in the United States.

In his unbridled speech, Faubus openly opposed the Supreme Court's decision to desegregate schools.

Xinhua News Agency, September 28th, New York Dispatch: Two unexploded bombs were discovered at the New York headquarters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) on the 27th.

The NAACP has consistently played a leading role in the struggle for Black rights and has been actively advocating for desegregation in Little Rock schools during the recent events.

In the Southern states, the NAACP has repeatedly been targeted by racist attacks.

    纵容种族主义分子迫害黑人
    美军即将撤出小石城
    据新华社28日讯　华盛顿消息：在阿肯色州小石城种族主义分子暴乱事件扩大因而派遣联邦军队前往该地仅仅三天以后，美国政府就对南方种族主义分子公开表示让步。美国国防部长威尔逊27日暗示不久即将撤退军队，他说：他希望联邦军队用不着在小石城耽搁更长的时间。同时，据报纸报道，美国政府已经答应讨论南部各州州长提出的撤退刚刚派往小石城的军队。
    美国政府的这种态度充分说明了派遣联邦军队前往小石城的决定决不是为了真正保护黑人的权利，而是企图免除国内外公众对美国种族主义者的暴行和美国政府的熟视无睹的抗议和谴责。
    美国广播电台和电视公司26日故意向南方种族主义鼓吹者之一阿肯色州长福布斯提供广泛的讲坛这一事实更加证实，在美国对种族主义者是何等姑息和纵容。
    福布斯在他的肆无忌惮的演说里公开反对实施最高法院关于在学校中取缔种族隔离的决定。
    新华社28日讯　纽约消息：美国全国有色人种协进会在纽约的总部27日发现了两枚没有爆炸的炸弹。
    协进会一向在争取黑人权利的斗争中起着领导作用，它在最近的小石城事件中也一直在力争解除小石城的学校种族隔离制度。
    在南方州内，协进会曾经有好几次成了种族主义分子袭击的目标。
