	Advocate for the Masses to Run Their Own Welfare Undertakings

	Relying on the strength of the masses themselves to run a portion of social welfare undertakings is an effective method to reduce the burden on the state and improve the people's lives.

	Recently, Lanzhou City established a Social Welfare Undertakings Fundraising Committee, mobilizing the masses to use their own strength to build some simple theaters, hotels, and to run other welfare undertakings. For the funds raised, it was decided to give the shareholders a certain interest based on the profitability of the welfare undertakings. If the shareholders are transferred from the local area, the shares can be refunded. The people of all circles in Lanzhou City are actively subscribing for shares, and the projects planned are also being actively prepared.

	The Chinese people have always had a fine tradition of raising funds to run social welfare undertakings. In the past, many places built bridges and roads, carried out water conservancy projects, and established schools, often by raising funds from the local people themselves. People regarded this kind of undertaking as a glorious cause, and those who participated in it were praised by the masses. Now, many places still maintain this fine tradition. Whenever the masses have the strength to run things, as long as someone comes forward to advocate, the masses will respond enthusiastically. In recent years, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Coal Industry, and the Ministry of Textile Industry have also had similar experiences. According to incomplete statistics, enterprises under these three ministries mobilized the masses and relied on their own strength to build more than two million square meters of employee housing, solving the housing problem for more than 100,000 employees. Most of these houses were built by employees and their families, using local materials, and the housing problem that employees urgently needed was solved in a very short time.

	These examples show that on the basis of production development, the lives of the masses have gradually improved, and they have a certain economic potential. For social welfare undertakings that the masses themselves care about, as long as they are mobilized and organized in a planned and led manner, the masses themselves can solve them. In recent years, the state has taken many measures to improve people's lives, such as building a large number of employee housing, expanding health care, strengthening labor protection, and increasing cultural and educational facilities, fully demonstrating the people's democratic state's concern for the people's lives. However, for the needs of socialist industrialization, the state must use its main financial resources for production and construction, and for certain non-productive constructions, it can only be increased appropriately according to the level of production development. Therefore, at present, the state cannot fully meet the needs of the masses, especially in some new industrial towns with rapid production development and high population growth. Except for some major and necessary facilities that must be run by the state, all undertakings that the masses have the strength to run themselves, such as simple employee housing, simple clubs, cinemas, etc., should be run by the masses themselves as much as possible.

	Some people think that in a society of socialist public ownership, all undertakings should be run by the public. This is an incorrect idea. According to preliminary estimates by the State Construction Commission, the construction cost per additional urban resident is 558 yuan to 695 yuan, and the construction cost per additional employee with family members (calculated as a family of four) is 2,620 yuan to 3,280 yuan. This figure does not include the investment in various equipment needed for public utilities and municipal engineering; if this cost is added, the investment will be even greater. According to a survey conducted by the State Statistical Bureau in ninety-nine cities across the country in September last year, approximately 1.1 million employees requested to be allocated family dormitories. Adding the newly added employees later, it is estimated that there are about 2.5 million people in the country who need housing. If the dormitory problem for all these people is solved, it will require at least 4.088 billion yuan to 5.615 billion yuan. This money is equivalent to 70% to 86% of China's industrial investment last year. If the state takes out such a large amount of money and uses it for non-productive projects, wouldn't that be equivalent to asking the state to abandon the plan for socialist construction? Everyone think about it, can this be done?

	China has a population of 600 million. The state must start from the 600 million population, take into account all aspects, and make appropriate arrangements for decisions on many major issues. It is absolutely impossible to demand that all welfare facilities be "taken care of" by the public. The development of production cannot keep up with the people's ever-increasing material and cultural needs, and this will remain an inevitable phenomenon for a long time to come. Our country's foundation is very poor, and there are many things that need to be done. We must adhere to the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, and mobilize all positive factors to serve socialism. The masses running a portion of social welfare undertakings with their own strength is one of the positive factors in building socialism. We must fully estimate the potential strength of the masses, and in a led, planned, and organized manner, absorb this huge potential force to participate in socialist construction.

### 提倡群众自己举办福利事业

    提倡群众自己举办福利事业
    依靠群众自己的力量，举办一部分社会福利事业，是减轻国家负担，改善人民生活的一个有效方法。
    最近兰州市成立了社会福利事业集资委员会，动员群众用自己的力量来修建一部分简易剧院、旅馆和兴办其它的一些福利事业。对于所集资金，决定按福利事业的赢利情况给认股者以一定的利息。如果认股者调离当地，股金可以退还。兰州市各界群众正在积极认股，计划修建的项目也在积极筹建中。
    我国人民一向就有集资举办社会福利事业的优良传统。过去，许多地方修桥补路、兴修水利、开办学校，往往是由当地群众自己筹集资金来举办的。人们把这种事业看做光荣的事业，参与这种事业的人受到了群众的赞扬。现在，许多地方仍然保持了这个优良传统，凡是群众有力量举办的事情，只要有人出来提倡，群众就会纷纷响应。近年来铁道部、煤炭工业部、纺织工业部也有类似的经验。据不完全统计，这三个部所属企业发动群众，依靠自己的力量，修建职工住宅二百多万平方公尺，解决了十多万职工的住房问题。这些房子，大都由职工和他们的家属参加建筑，就地取材，在很短时间内就解决了职工迫切要求的住宅问题。
    这些事例说明了在生产发展的基础上，群众的生活逐步有了改善，并且有了一定的经济潜力，对于群众自己所关心的社会福利事业，只要有计划有领导地加以动员和组织，群众自己就能够解决。几年来，国家为了改善人民生活，已经采取了很多措施，诸如大量修建职工住宅，扩大保健医疗事业，加强劳动保护工作，增加文化教育设施，充分体现了人民民主国家对人民生活的关怀。但是，国家为了社会主义工业化的需要，必须把主要的财力用到生产建设上去，对于某些非生产性的建设，只能按照生产发展的水平而适当增加。因此，目前国家还不能全部满足群众的需要，特别是在一些生产发展很快，人口增长较多的新工业城镇，除了一些重大的十分必要的设施必须由国家举办以外，凡是群众自己有力量举办的事业，如职工简易住宅，简易的俱乐部、电影院等等，都应该尽可能地依靠群众自己去办。
    有些人以为，在全民所有制的社会中，一切事业应该统统由公家举办。这是不正确的想法。根据国家建设委员会初步估算，城市人口每增加一人需要建设费用五百五十八元到六百九十五元，每增加一户带眷属的职工（以全家四口人计算）需要建设费用二千六百二十到三千二百八十元。这个数字还没有包括公用事业、市政工程所需要的各种设备投资在内；如果加上这笔费用，投资就要更大。另据国家统计局去年9月在全国九十九个城市的普查，职工要求拨给家属宿舍的约有一百一十万人，加上后来新增加的职工，估计全国共有二百五十万人左右需要房子。如果统统解决这些人的宿舍问题，至少就需要四十亿八千八百万元到五十六亿一千五百万元。这些钱相当于去年我国工业投资的70％到86％。要国家拿出这样大量的钱，用到非生产性的项目上去，那不就等于要国家放弃社会主义建设的计划吗？大家想想看，难道可以这样做吗？
    我国有六亿人口，国家对于许多重大问题的决定，必须从六亿人口出发，统筹兼顾，适当安排。要求一切福利设施，统统由公家“包下来”是决不可能的。生产的发展赶不上人民日益增长的物质文化的需要，这在今后一个长时期内仍然是不可避免的现象。我们的国家底子很穷，需要举办的事情很多，必须坚持勤俭建国的方针，动员一切积极因素为社会主义服务。群众用自己的力量举办一部分社会福利事业，正是建设社会主义的积极因素之一。我们必须充分估计群众的潜在力量，有领导、有计划、有组织地吸收这一巨大的潜在力，参加到社会主义建设中来。
