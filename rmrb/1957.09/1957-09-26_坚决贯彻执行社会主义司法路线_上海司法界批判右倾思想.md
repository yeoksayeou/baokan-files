    Resolutely Implement the Socialist Judicial Line
    Shanghai Judicial Circles Criticize Rightist Ideologies
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 22nd (Special Dispatch) - Leading cadres of people's courts at all levels in Shanghai, in a three-day meeting recently held, unanimously agreed that the Shanghai Municipal Higher People's Court has serious rightist tendencies in leading adjudication work.
    This meeting affirmed the achievements of Shanghai's judicial work and emphasized the rightist ideology of one-sidedly implementing the lenient policy and neglecting punishment. Presidents and division chiefs of two intermediate people's courts and eighteen basic-level people's courts pointed out at the meeting one after another: According to inspections, in the past year, the Municipal Higher People's Court, in its supervision of adjudication in lower courts, failed to sentence many counter-revolutionary cases that should have been sentenced, or gave light sentences for serious crimes; in leading the inspection of cases, there was a tendency to only check mistakes and not omissions, and to emphasize releasing more while ignoring whether there were light sentences or wrongful releases.
    Inspections of many cases show that Shanghai's judicial leading organs are weak and ineffective in striking against counter-revolutionaries and various types of criminal offenders. For example, the counter-revolutionary Ling Xianyang colluded with German fascists before liberation and later suppressed striking workers in Shanghai; during his tenure as president of Hujiang University, he repeatedly sabotaged student movements; in 1951, Ling Xianyang was arrested for the above-mentioned counter-revolutionary crimes. However, in February of this year, the Municipal Higher Court announced that Ling would not be held criminally responsible on the grounds that Ling's crimes mostly occurred before liberation and that he was able to confess truthfully after his arrest. The rightist Huang Shaohong used this case to attack the people's judicial organs. For another example, an illegal capitalist who stole more than 80,000 yuan of state copper materials was exempted from punishment; a heinous criminal who had illicit relations with twenty women and disrupted many family harmonies was found not guilty; and some hooligans and loafers who endangered social order and aroused great public indignation were sentenced to "educational release." Speakers also criticized the Municipal Higher People's Court for not paying enough attention to the handling of the relatively large number of civil cases in recent years.
    More than thirty leading cadres of basic-level judicial organs mentioned in their speeches that due to the growth of rightist thinking in the leading organs, the adjudication work of the city's basic-level people's courts had also produced rightist sentiments such as overly lenient sentencing and fear of criminals "crying injustice." The consequences of this rightist guiding ideology are that some criminals who should not have been released not only did not repent but made unreasonable demands, even brazenly demanding that the court "compensate for their reputation," and wrote letters to rightists Huang Shaohong, Wang Zaoshi, Yang Zhaolong, etc., wantonly slandering the people's democratic legal system; therefore, objectively, it also fueled the arrogance of rightists in attacking the judicial departments, and the activities of hooligans and loafers became rampant again. They disrupted social order and even openly said to the police: "This is a matter of internal contradictions among the people, the court doesn't care, and you shouldn't either."
    Speakers pointed out that the reason why the Municipal Higher People's Court has quite serious rightist tendencies is mainly because leading cadres, after the upsurge of socialist transformation last year, did not fully recognize the changes in the class struggle in Shanghai under the new circumstances, overemphasizing the side that the ownership system had been fundamentally changed and that social order had been stabilized, even believing that counter-revolutionaries would no longer dare to act rashly and that capitalists would no longer commit crimes, and that criminals could all be educated and treated leniently. Thus, they did not pay attention to constantly understanding the criminal situation in society, and individual leading cadres of the Municipal Higher People's Court even mistakenly believed that "raising vigilance is the business of the public security organs, and the court is for preventing mistakes."
    Speakers also pointed out that the rightist ideology of the Municipal Higher People's Court is related to bureaucratism in leadership, and in adjudication work, they often do not consult with lower-level judicial organs or listen to the opinions of trial judges in the first instance. According to preliminary inspections by various basic-level people's courts, many cases that should not have been changed were wrongly changed by the higher court subjectively looking at the case files without investigation and research.
    Speakers also believed that rightist thinking in adjudication work is inseparable from being influenced by old legal concepts. In the selection and training of judicial cadres, and in improving the quality of adjudication, leading cadres sometimes neglected the view that justice must serve the current socialist construction, relaxed the socialist political and ideological education of judicial personnel throughout the city, and even proposed learning from old judicial personnel, thus seriously affecting the quality of adjudication. The trial of many cases resulted in rightist errors under the influence of old legal thought.
    This meeting will continue. Leading cadres of courts at all levels attending the meeting believe that this kind of meeting is of great significance for adhering to and implementing the socialist judicial line.

### 坚决贯彻执行社会主义司法路线  上海司法界批判右倾思想

    坚决贯彻执行社会主义司法路线
    上海司法界批判右倾思想
    本报特约新华社上海22日电上海市各级人民法院的领导干部在最近举行的三天集会中，一致认为市高级人民法院在领导审判工作中，严重存在着右倾思想。
    这个会议肯定了上海市司法工作的成绩，着重指出了存在的片面地贯彻宽大政策、忽视惩罚的右倾思想。两个中级人民法院和十八个基层人民法院的院长、庭长在会上先后指出：根据检查，近一年来，市高级人民法院对下级法院实施审判监督中，对不少反革命案件是该判不判或重罪轻判；在领导检查案件工作中，有只查错，不查漏，以及强调多放，而忽视了是否轻判、错放的偏向。
    很多案件的检查表明，上海市审判领导机关对反革命分子和各类刑事罪犯的打击是软弱无力的，例如反革命分子凌宪扬解放前和德国法西斯勾结，后来又在上海镇压罢工工人；他在担任沪江大学校长期间，又多次破坏学生运动；1951年凌宪扬因上述反革命罪被捕。但市高级法院今年2月竟以凌宪扬犯罪多在解放以前，并在被捕后还能坦白认罪为理由，宣布对凌不追究刑事责任。右派分子黄绍竑曾利用这一案件向人民司法机关进攻。又例如：曾经盗窃国家铜料八万多元的不法资本家，被免予处分；一个因同二十个妇女通奸而破坏很多家庭和睦的恶劣罪犯被判无罪；一些危害社会秩序、民愤很大的流氓、阿飞被判处“教育释放”。发言的人还批判了市高级人民法院对近年来为数较多的民事案件的处理也重视不够。
    三十多个基层司法机关的领导干部在发言中，都提到由于领导机关右倾思想的滋长，使全市基层人民法院的审判工作也产生了量刑偏宽、怕犯罪分子“叫冤”等右倾情绪。这种右倾指导思想造成的后果，使一些不该释放而释放的罪犯反而不思悔改无理取闹，甚至蛮横地要法院“赔偿名誉”，并且写信给右派分子黄绍竑、王造时、杨兆龙等，肆意污蔑人民民主法制；因而客观上也助长了右派分子向司法部门进攻的气焰，流氓、阿飞的活动又猖獗起来，他们扰乱社会秩序，还公开对民警说：“这是人民内部矛盾，法院不管，你们也别管”。
    发言的人指出：市高级人民法院所以存在相当严重的右倾思想，主要是由于领导干部从去年社会主义改造高潮以后，对阶级斗争在上海新情况下的变化认识不足，过分强调所有制已经根本改变，社会秩序已经安定的一面，甚至认为反革命分子再也不敢蠢动，资本家也不会再犯罪了，犯罪分子都可以教育、宽大处理，于是，不重视经常了解社会上的犯罪情况，市高级人民法院的个别领导干部居然错误地认为“提高警惕是公安机关的事，法院是防错”。
    发言的人还指出：市高级人民法院的右倾思想，同领导上的官僚主义有关，在审判工作中常常不和下级司法机关商量、不倾听第一审审判员的意见。据各基层人民法院初步检查，不少不该改判的案件，就由于上级法院单纯看卷宗，没有调查研究而主观主义地改判错了。
    发言的人还认为审判工作中的右倾思想是和受旧法观点的影响分不开的。在司法干部的挑选、培养方面，在提高审判质量方面，领导干部有时忽视司法必须为当前社会主义建设服务的观点，放松了向全市司法人员进行社会主义政治思想教育，甚至提出向旧司法人员学习，因而严重影响审判质量，不少案件的审理，就是在旧法思想的影响下发生右倾错误的。
    这个会议将继续举行。出席会议的各级法院领导干部认为这种会议对坚持贯彻社会主义司法路线有重大的意义。
