Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 3rd: The scientific appraisal of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge officially began today. The entire appraisal is expected to take one week.

Conducting a formal scientific appraisal of a newly built bridge is a first in China's bridge construction history. The purpose of this appraisal is to prove whether the design effect of the bridge is in accordance with theoretical assumptions, and to prepare for the bridge to be handed over for national acceptance. Through the appraisal, theoretical basis will also be provided for future bridge designs.

Today's appraisal of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge used a "double-engine multiple-unit" loaded train (that is, each train is pulled by two locomotives) and various scientific instruments. Many scientific instruments, such as resistance strain gauges, mechanical strain gauges, and universal calculators, were pre-installed in various parts of the bridge. Then, the appraisal trains were allowed to run side by side on the bridge, so that the stress condition of each part of the bridge was displayed on the instruments.

According to the person in charge of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, the bridge's appraisal work will be carried out in two ways: static load test and dynamic load test. From today to tomorrow, all static load tests will be carried out, and dynamic load tests will be carried out later. Dynamic load tests will include high-speed driving and emergency braking. In addition, the appraisers will also conduct scientific inspections on the quality of the steel beam members. When all these tasks are completed, people can make a comprehensive conclusion on the quality of the bridge.

Participating in this appraisal work include experts, professors, and engineering technicians from the Bridge Appraisal Team of the Ministry of Railways, the Railway Science Research Institute, Tangshan Railway Institute, and the Central South Civil Engineering and Architectural College. They were invited by the Bridge Engineering Bureau to participate in this work.

    长江大桥质量如何？
    现正进行严格的科学鉴定
    新华社武汉3日电　武汉长江大桥的科学鉴定工作今天正式开始。全部鉴定工作预计需要一周的时间。
    对新建桥梁进行正规的科学鉴定，这在我国桥梁建筑史上还是第一次。作这种鉴定的目的，是要证明桥的设计效果是否与理论上的假设相符合，并且为大桥交付国家验收进行准备。通过鉴定，还将为今后的桥梁设计提供理论根据。
    武汉长江大桥今天的鉴定，是采用“双机重联”的载重列车（即每一列车由两个机车牵引）和多种科学仪器来进行的。很多科学仪器如电阻应变仪、机械式应变仪、万能计算仪等，事先被安置在桥的各个部位上，然后让鉴定列车并排在桥上开行，这样，桥的各部位的受力情况就在仪器上表示出来。
    据武汉长江大桥工程局负责人谈，大桥的鉴定工作，将分静载试验和动载试验两种方式来进行。从今天开始到明天，将全部作静载试验，以后将进行动载试验。动载试验将包括高速行车和紧急刹车等项目。此外，鉴定人员还将对钢梁杆件的质量进行科学检查。当这些工作都完成以后，人们就可以对大桥的质量作出全面的结论。
    参加这次鉴定工作的包括有铁道部桥梁鉴定队、铁道科学研究院、唐山铁道学院和中南土木建筑学院的专家、教授及工程技术人员。他们是应大桥工程局的邀请前来参加这项工作的。
