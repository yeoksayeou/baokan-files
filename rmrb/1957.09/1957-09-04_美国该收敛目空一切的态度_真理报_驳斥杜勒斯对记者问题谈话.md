Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd: According to TASS, Moscow, September 2nd: "Pravda" published a commentary on September 2nd regarding Dulles's remarks on the issue of American journalists visiting China. The commentary stated that under the pressure of public opinion, Dulles allowed a group of journalists selected by the State Department to visit China. However, he also announced a decision insulting to the people of China, emphasizing that Chinese journalists would not be allowed to visit the United States. This practice of the State Department has been justly refuted by public opinion in the People's Republic of China.

On the one hand, the State Department allows American journalists to visit China, while on the other hand, it reserves the right to supervise and guide their activities. From this, it can be seen that the United States attempts to use journalists as tools to carry out sabotage activities and incite hatred between China and the United States.

"Pravda" said that it is time for some Americans to rein in their arrogant attitude. These people should know that the great socialist power—the People's Republic of China—does not exist and develop according to Mr. Dulles's will. They should understand how to speak to sovereign states. Regarding relations with China, the U.S. government is resolutely unwilling to implement the principle of reciprocity, and the arrogant tone of the State Department spokesperson's remarks can only arouse the righteous indignation of world democratic public opinion.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 3rd: "The Times of India" today published an article from Washington written by American journalist James Marlow, criticizing Dulles for undermining the visit of American journalists to China.

Marlow wrote that Dulles and his State Department, after repeatedly refusing for a year, lifted the ban on American journalists visiting China, but the wording used was such that "the Chinese cannot fail to feel insulted."

Marlow said that when Dulles proposed some time ago that the release of all Americans in Chinese prisons be a condition, it was completely "using the American news media as part of the government's foreign policy."

The author condemned the State Department's suggestion that American journalists should specifically collect information on difficulties in China's construction and be particularly interested in the rampant attacks by right-wing elements in China during the rectification campaign.

The author finally criticized Dulles for not allowing reciprocal visits by American and Chinese journalists.

### 美国该收敛目空一切的态度  “真理报”驳斥杜勒斯对记者问题谈话

    美国该收敛目空一切的态度
    “真理报”驳斥杜勒斯对记者问题谈话
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科2日讯：“真理报”9月2日就杜勒斯关于美国记者访问中国的问题的谈话发表评论。评论说，杜勒斯在社会舆论的压力下允许了一批由国务院挑选的记者访问中国，但是他又宣布了侮辱人民中国的决定，强调不允许中国记者访问美国。国务院这个做法已经遭到了中华人民共和国舆论的正义驳斥。
    国务院一方面允许美国记者访问中国，同时又保留监督和指导他们活动的权利。由此可见，美国企图利用记者作为进行破坏活动和煽动中国和美国之间的仇恨的工具。
    “真理报”说，现在该是某些美国人士收敛他们目空一切的态度的时候了，这些人应当知道社会主义大国——中华人民共和国并不依杜勒斯先生的意志而存在和发展，他们应当懂得如何同主权国家说话。在同中国的关系方面，美国政府坚决不愿意执行互惠原则和国务院发言人谈话的骄傲语调只能引起世界民主舆论的正义愤怒。
    新华社新德里3日电“印度时报”今天发表了来自华盛顿的一篇美国记者詹姆斯·马劳所写的批评杜勒斯破坏美国记者访问中国的文章。
    马劳写道，杜勒斯和他的国务院在接连不断地拒绝了一年之久以后取消了对美国记者访华的禁令，但是所使用的词句是“中国人不会不感到受侮辱的”。
    马劳说，当杜勒斯前些时候提出以释放中国监狱内的全部美国人为条件的时候，那完全是“把美国的新闻媒介当作政府外交政策的一部分”。
    作者谴责了国务院要美国记者专门搜集中国建设中的困难和对中国国内右派分子在整风期间的猖狂进攻特别感到兴趣的建议。
    作者最后批评杜勒斯不该禁止美国和中国记者互惠的来往。
