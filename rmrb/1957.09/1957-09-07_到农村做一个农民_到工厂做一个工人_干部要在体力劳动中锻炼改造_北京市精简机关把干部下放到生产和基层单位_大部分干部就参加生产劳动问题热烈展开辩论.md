    To Become a Farmer in the Countryside, to Become a Worker in the Factory
    Cadres Should Temper and Remold Themselves Through Physical Labor
    Beijing Streamlines Organizations, Sends Cadres Down to Production and Grassroots Units; Most Cadres Engage in Heated Debate on the Issue of Participating in Productive Labor

    Xinhua News Agency, 6th Dispatch. Beijing: Beijing's various organizations are currently streamlining administrative and enterprise management structures, sending cadres down to production and grassroots units to work. The first batch of cadres has already departed, and the second batch will be ready to leave soon.

    At the second session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Congress, which closed on August 4th, Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen pointed out in his speech: We must resolutely and thoroughly smash the attacks of bourgeois right-wingers, and at the same time, we must resolutely and conscientiously rectify our work style and overcome shortcomings in our work. In order to fundamentally improve our work style, establish close ties between leading organs and the working masses, and further establish a glorious labor and thrifty ethos among all the people in the capital, Peng Zhen suggested that in addition to cadres participating in a portion of physical labor, we should also draw approximately 30% to 50% of the staff from existing administrative and enterprise units to participate in productive labor and grassroots work for a longer period.

    Cadres from various organizations in Beijing have widely and deeply discussed Comrade Peng Zhen's report, using the specific situations of their own organizations to demonstrate the necessity of this measure. Although Beijing's organizations have undergone several simplifications in recent years, the phenomenon of bloated structures and overstaffing is still quite serious. For example, the originally planned staffing for the Tax Bureau was 1,295 people, but the actual number of personnel has reached 1,820, resulting in many cadres having little to do. During the discussion, everyone agreed that this time, the determination to streamline personnel and send cadres down would not only support industrial and agricultural production and strengthen the grassroots, but also enable leading organs to more promptly understand the problems occurring in the production and lives of the workers and peasants, preventing and promptly overcoming bureaucracy in leading organs.

    In the discussion, many people also mentioned that among the cadres in various organizations, very few have truly participated in physical labor for a relatively long period. For example, out of 109 cadres in the Municipal Planning Commission, only eight have participated in physical labor for more than two years; out of 297 cadres in the Construction Engineering Bureau, only 65, or 12.9%, have participated in physical labor for a relatively long period. Most cadres know very little about how workers and peasants live and work. Some cadres said: We can only say in theory that the working class is worth learning from, but when it comes to specifics, we can't say clearly how we should learn from the working class. Some people also said: As early as when we were studying the history of social development, we knew that labor is great and that labor can transform people, but until now, we still cannot specifically answer why. Some cadres who grew up in the city said: We are particular about food and clothing, but we are not very clear about how "food" and "clothing" actually come about. Some cadres who had undergone the tempering of war and labor also believed that since liberation, they have spent more time sitting in offices and have gradually become estranged from and unfamiliar with the lives of workers and peasants. Many cadres expressed that it is very dangerous if these thoughts and phenomena are not overcome and corrected. Cadres in a socialist country should have a firm political stance and be able to share weal and woe with the working people, sharing life and death.

    However, during the discussion, some incorrect ideas were gradually exposed. Some people used various methods to express their unwillingness to participate in labor, believing that "asking us intellectuals to participate in labor is incomprehensible" and a "waste of talent"; some people also emphasized that farmers are unsanitary and afraid of mosquitoes, bedbugs, frogs, and snakes; some people said, "We don't even recognize agricultural production tools, I'm afraid we'll have difficulty engaging in production"; some people who are clearly not sick or only have minor illnesses now say they are sick; some people have great concerns about their rank, salary, benefits, subsidies, and public medical care after participating in labor, and some people have raised various difficulties in their family life after participating in labor.

    The vast majority of organizations launched debates on these issues. In the debate, those arguments that participating in labor "is incomprehensible" and a "waste of talent" were criticized. Many cadres pointed out that most intellectual cadres are very unfamiliar with industrial and agricultural production and the lives of workers and peasants, and that participating in physical labor is appropriate and an indispensable path for cadres in a socialist country. Participating in physical labor is not a "waste of talent," but a good opportunity to temper and remold oneself, and a good way to raise one's class consciousness and strengthen one's working-class stance. In the debate, the bourgeois thinking that farmers are "unsanitary" and that "rural life is hard" was also criticized. Some units specially organized everyone to visit the countryside to truly understand the rural situation. In the debate, cadres who had worked in the farm for more than a month in the summer vividly reported the education they had received from physical labor. The fact that many cadres did not first consider the needs of the country and the people, but haggled over welfare benefits and other issues, was also criticized. At the same time, the Municipal People's Committee also made appropriate regulations on these issues. Regarding the family life difficulties raised by some cadres, they were asked to openly present them for everyone to discuss, to distinguish which were real difficulties and which were not. Assistance was given to solve those difficulties that were genuine and could be solved, and those who emphasized difficulties but were unwilling to participate in labor were criticized, helping them to correctly understand this issue.

    Through debate, a glorious labor ethos has been established in various organizations in Beijing. "Participate in physical labor, temper and remold yourself!" "Go to the countryside to be an ordinary farmer, go to the construction site and factory to be an ordinary worker!" has become the common aspiration of cadres. Alongside the big-character posters criticizing right-wingers, there have been large numbers of big-character posters requesting to participate in physical labor. Many cadres have submitted applications to their leaders requesting to participate in labor. A young technician from a poor peasant background said: Although I am from a poor peasant background, I have indeed forgotten my roots in recent years. My class feelings have gradually become estranged from the poor peasants. I request to participate in physical labor to temper and remold myself. Sun Peiling, a cadre from the Beijing Tax Bureau who had worked in the Kuomintang Tax Bureau, also actively requested to remold himself through physical labor, and also expressed that he would take his fifteen-year-old son, who had failed to enter middle school, to participate in labor together.

### 到农村做一个农民　到工厂做一个工人  干部要在体力劳动中锻炼改造  北京市精简机关把干部下放到生产和基层单位  大部分干部就参加生产劳动问题热烈展开辩论

    到农村做一个农民　到工厂做一个工人
    干部要在体力劳动中锻炼改造
    北京市精简机关把干部下放到生产和基层单位  大部分干部就参加生产劳动问题热烈展开辩论
    新华社6日讯　北京市各机关正在精简行政机关和企业管理机构，把干部下放到生产和基层单位去工作。现在第一批干部已经出发，第二批干部不日也即可出发。
    在8月4日闭幕的北京市第二届人民代表大会第二次会议上，北京市市长彭真在讲话中指出：我们必须坚决彻底地粉碎资产阶级右派分子的进攻，同时也必须坚决认真地整顿作风，克服工作中的缺点。为了从根本上改进作风，使领导机关同劳动群众密切联系，并且在首都一切人民中间进一步树立劳动光荣和勤俭节约风气，彭真建议今后除了干部参加一部分体力劳动外，还要从现有的各机关和事业企业单位管理人员中，抽出30％到50％左右的工作人员，较长期的参加生产劳动和基层工作。
    北京市各机关干部广泛深入地讨论了彭真同志的报告，他们并以本机关的具体情况来证明这一措施的必要。几年来北京市各机关虽然进行过几次精简，但是机构臃肿、人浮于事的现象还相当严重。如税务局原定编制是一千二百九十五人，现在实有人数达到一千八百二十人，因此许多干部没有多少事情做。在讨论中，大家认为这一次下决心精简人员，把干部下放，不但能够支援工农业生产和加强基层，而且还使领导机关能更及时地了解工农群众在生产生活中发生的问题，防止和及时克服领导机关的官僚主义。
    在讨论中许多人也谈到了各机关干部中，真正比较长期参加过体力劳动的很少。如市计划委员会一百零九个干部中，参加过两年以上体力劳动的只有八人；建筑工程局二百九十七个干部中，比较长期参加过体力劳动的也只有六十五人，占12.9％。大部分干部对于工农群众如何生活和工作很少知道。有些干部说：我们只能从理论上说工人阶级值得学习，但是具体起来说究竟应当怎样向工人阶级学习就说不清了。也有的人说：早在学习社会发展史时，我们就知道劳动伟大，劳动能改造人，但是直到现在我们还不能具体回答为什么。有的从小在城市长大的干部说：我们讲究吃讲究穿，但“吃”“穿”究竟怎样来的我们还不太清楚。有些经过战争和劳动锻炼的干部也认为，解放以后坐机关时候多了，对工农群众生活逐渐生疏不熟悉起来。许多干部都表示以上这些思想和现象不克服和纠正是非常危险的，一个社会主义国家的干部应当是要有坚定的政治立场，能同劳动人民同甘共苦，生死相依。
    但在讨论过程中，也有一些不正确的思想逐渐暴露出来。有的人用各种方法表示不愿意参加劳动，他们认为“叫我们知识分子参加劳动是不可理解的”，是“屈了才”；有的人还强调农民不卫生，怕蚊子、臭虫、青蛙、蛇；有的人说，“我们连农业生产工具都不认得，恐怕搞生产有困难”；有的人明明没有病或只有小病的现在说有病；有的人对参加劳动后级别、薪金、福利、补助、公费医疗等有很大的顾虑，还有一些人提出了参加劳动后各种各样家庭生活上的困难。
    绝大部分机关针对这些问题展开了辩论。在辩论中，那些认为参加劳动“是不可理解的”、“屈才的”论调受到了批判。许多干部指出，现在大部分知识分子干部对于工农业生产和工农群众的生活生疏得很，参加体力劳动是应当的，是一个社会主义国家的干部必不可少的途径。参加体力劳动不是“屈才”了，而是锻炼改造自己的好机会，提高自己阶级觉悟坚定工人阶级立场的好方法。在辩论中，也批判了那种认为农民“不卫生”“农村生活苦”等等资产阶级思想。有的单位为了使干部真正了解农村情况，特地组织大家到农村参观。在辩论中，曾在夏季到农场义务劳动过一个多月的干部，生动地报告了体力劳动对自己的教育。对于许多干部首先不考虑国家和人民的需要，而斤斤计较福利待遇等问题，也受到了批判。同时市人民委员会对于这些问题也作了适当规定。对于一些干部提出的家庭生活方面的困难问题，要他公开摆出来给大家讨论，那些是真正困难，那些实际不是困难。对于真正而且可以解决的困难协助解决，对于那些强调困难而不愿参加劳动的人进行了批判，帮助他正确认识这个问题。
    通过辩论，在北京市各机关中树立了劳动光荣风气，“参加体力劳动，锻炼改造自己！”“到农村去做一个普通农民，到工地、工厂去做一个普通工人！”成为干部们的普遍要求。在反右派大字报旁边出现了大批要求参加体力劳动的大字报。许多干部向领导上提出了要求参加劳动的申请书。有一个贫农出身的青年技术员说：我虽是个贫农出身的人，但这些年来确实有些忘本了，我的阶级感情慢慢同贫农疏远了，我要求参加体力劳动锻炼改造自己。曾经在国民党税务局工作过的北京市税务局干部孙培令，也积极要求通过体力劳动改造自己，他并且表示要把他的未能考上中学的十五岁儿子一起带去参加劳动。
