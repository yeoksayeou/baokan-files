    Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant
    Produces a New Product on Average Every Seven Days
    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 23rd—Since the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has produced a new product on average every seven days. The new products successfully trial-produced by this plant in the past eight years and five months are equivalent to more than five times the total number of products produced in the ten years before liberation.
    The successful trial production and putting into production of a large number of new products has enabled this old and outdated iron and steel plant to play a huge role. The various steels and steel products it produces not only support the large-scale industrial construction in various places, but also support agriculture. Many types of steel are ones that China has never produced before.
    During the period of economic recovery and the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, the state successively invested funds equivalent to 1.62 times the original fixed assets in the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, enabling the plant to restore all its original equipment, expand the thin plate, electric furnace, forged steel and medium-sized rolling, coking workshops and sections, balance equipment, and rebuild the refractory material department according to the latest technical standards, transforming the plant into a comprehensive iron and steel plant with a complete production process.
    In recent years, 94 Soviet experts have come to the plant to provide guidance and assistance more than 150 times. They have put forward more than 3,000 suggestions on technological innovation and other aspects. A large number of new products of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant were successfully trial-produced under the direct guidance of Soviet experts.

    太原钢铁厂
    平均七天出产一种新产品
    新华社太原23日电　太原钢铁厂执行第一个五年计划以来，平均每七天就有一种新产品诞生。这个厂在过去八年又五个月中试制成功的新产品，相当于解放以前十年内生产产品总数的五倍以上。
    新产品的大量试制成功并投入生产，使这个本来设备老旧的钢铁厂发挥出巨大的作用。它所生产的各种钢和钢材不仅支援了各地的大工业建设，也支援了农业。有许多钢是我国过去从来没有生产过的。
    在经济恢复时期和执行第一个五年计划期间，国家先后给太原钢铁厂投入了相当于原有固定资产一点六二倍的资金，使这个厂恢复了原有的全部设备，扩建了薄板、电炉、锻钢和中型轧钢、炼焦等车间和工段，平衡了设备，按照最新的技术标准改建了耐火材料部，使这个厂改变成为生产过程完整的综合性的钢铁厂。
    这几年中，先后有九十四位苏联专家到这个厂作了一百五十多次指导与帮助。他们就革新生产技术和其他方面提出了三千多项建议。太原钢铁厂的大量新产品就是在苏联专家的直接指导下试制成功的。
