Beijing Universities Begin New Academic Year
Renmin University and Normal University Arrange Socialist Ideological Education Courses

(Our newspaper reports) Beijing's universities have begun the new academic year.

Renmin University of China held its new academic year opening ceremony on the 14th.

Hu Xikui, Party Secretary and Vice-President, spoke first at the meeting. He focused on how to conduct the socialist ideological education course, pointing out several stages for teaching this course: listening to reports, studying documents, then launching a large-scale debate, and finally making an ideological summary. At the same time, in conjunction with this course, the teaching of various professional courses will also be improved to further enhance the quality of teaching.

President Wu Yuzhang also spoke amidst thunderous applause. President Wu Yuzhang had only recently returned from the hospital. He congratulated the new students on beginning their university life and encouraged them to achieve new successes in the new academic year. He said that the Chinese Communist Party, which has been tested for more than thirty years, will always represent the truth. The right-wingers' attack has failed miserably. Contrary to their wishes, the people of the whole country are determined to take the socialist road. He encouraged everyone to be tempered in the struggle, conscientiously transform their thinking, and study the socialist ideological education course well.

Beijing Normal University held its new academic year opening ceremony on the morning of the 14th. President Chen Yuan said at the opening ceremony: This new academic year begins under the situation of a great victory in the anti-rightist struggle. Universities and colleges must conduct socialist ideological education in the future, further deeply and meticulously criticize bourgeois rightist ideology, so that the majority of teachers, students, and staff can raise their awareness and transform their thinking.

Vice-President He Xilin gave a report on the guidelines and tasks for the new academic year. He said that the new academic year will focus on carrying out socialist ideological education, and the Communist Youth League, the trade union, and the democratic parties in the school should, under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, take on the task of carrying out socialist ideological education. The political courses for all grades of students and the four political courses for faculty and staff will be changed to socialist ideological education courses. This course will be conducted in the form of a large-scale debate, and the policy of unity—criticism—unity will be implemented, adopting the approach of gentle breeze and mild rain.

Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Agricultural University and other schools will also start school successively in mid-September and late September.
