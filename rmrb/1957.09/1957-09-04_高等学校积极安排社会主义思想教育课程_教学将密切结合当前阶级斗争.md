Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd—Universities across the country are actively preparing to offer socialist ideological education courses in anticipation of the new semester.

The Communist Party Committees of universities in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Xi'an, Wuhan, Chengdu, Harbin, and other locations are paying close attention to this work. The Party Committees of Peking University, Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering, Sichuan University, and others have established "Socialist Ideological Education Committees" to uniformly arrange, inspect, and summarize the work of various political teaching and research offices. Party secretaries, deputy secretaries, presidents, and vice-presidents of Renmin University of China, Wuhan University, Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, and other schools have also formed lecture groups to personally lecture teachers and staff on this course.

Many schools have established specialized groups to collect and organize materials related to the anti-Rightist struggle from provincial, municipal, and national newspapers and periodicals as reference for lectures. Currently, the teaching plan of Renmin University of China has been preliminarily drafted, divided into twelve topics, and preparations are being made to compile and print learning materials before the start of the semester, distributing one copy to each student if possible.

Various localities are also paying attention to organizing teachers to study diligently and strengthen tutoring. In Beijing, Sichuan, and other places, many Marxist-Leninist teachers in universities began studying various relevant materials and basic documents from mid-August, gaining a relatively clear understanding of the nature of this course, thereby examining and criticizing past shortcomings in political theory teaching, such as insufficient integration with reality, and realizing that future teaching must be closely integrated with the current class struggle, Party policies, and the educational objectives. Some schools in Shanghai are also preparing to transfer Party and Youth League secretaries from various departments who originally worked on student ideological work to strengthen political course tutoring.

The teaching methods of this course will also differ from the past. Many schools have decided to adopt a method of first having teachers give systematic lectures, followed by large-scale debates.

Universities across the country are preparing to increase the lecture hours for this course in the next semester. Renmin University of China will study one day per week, for a total of one year. In addition to increasing the study hours for this course, universities in Shanghai are also preparing to organize faculty and students to visit rural areas and factories when necessary, and invite people to give special reports.

    高等学校积极安排社会主义思想教育课程
    教学将密切结合当前阶级斗争
    据新华社3日讯　各地高等学校正在积极准备开设社会主义思想教育课程，迎接新学年。
    北京、上海、天津、西安、武汉、成都、哈尔滨等地各高等学校中的中国共产党委员会都很重视这项工作。北京大学、西安建筑工程学院、四川大学等校党委会都成立了“社会主义思想教育委员会”来统一布置、检查总结各政治教研室的工作。中国人民大学、武汉大学、上海政法学院等校的党委书记、副书记和校长、副校长等还领导组成讲师团，准备自己给教师、员工讲授这门功课。
    许多学校都成立了专门小组来搜集整理本省本市和全国报刊有关反右派斗争的材料，作为讲课时参考。目前，中国人民大学的教学方案已经初步拟好，共分为十二个专题，还准备在开学以前把学习资料编印出来，尽可能发给学生人手一份。
    各地还注意组织教师认真学习和加强辅导力量等工作。北京、四川等地许多高等学校的马列主义教师，从8月中旬就开始学习各种有关的材料和基本文件，对这一课程的性质有了比较明确的认识，从而检查、批判了过去在政治理论教课中结合实际不够等缺点，认识到今后教学必须密切结合当前的阶级斗争、党的政策和教育对象来进行。上海某些学校还准备抽调各系原来做学生思想工作的党、团书记，来加强政治课的辅导工作。
    这门课程的教学方法，也将与以往不同。许多学校都决定采取先由教师作系统讲课，接着进行大辩论的方式。
    各地高等学校都准备在下学期增加这一课程的讲授时数。中国人民大学是每周学习一天，共学一年。上海各高等学校除增加这门课程的学习时数外，还准备在必要时组织教职员和学生到农村、工厂去参观访问，请人作专题报告。
