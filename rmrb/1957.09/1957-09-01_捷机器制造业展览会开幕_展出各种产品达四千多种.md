    Czechoslovak Machine Manufacturing Exhibition Opens
    Exhibiting Over Four Thousand Products
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The third Czechoslovak Machine Manufacturing Exhibition began on September 1 in Brno. This exhibition is richer and more colorful than the previous two. It will showcase more than four thousand products from various sectors of Czechoslovak machine manufacturing, with a total exhibition area of 110,000 square meters both indoors and outdoors.

    Two-thirds of the industrial products exhibited this year will be from the heavy machinery manufacturing sector. This includes nearly four hundred new products. Precision machinery manufacturing will exhibit approximately eighty new products. The automotive industry will feature eighteen new products. In the field of agricultural machinery, there will be fourteen completely new types of agricultural machines. The newly produced Czechoslovak "Tatra 603" car will be one of the eye-catching exhibits. This car uses an air-cooled engine, which is much lighter than ordinary engines, weighing only 160 kilograms. The "Tatra 603" has low fuel consumption (only 12.5 liters per 100 kilometers), but it is very fast, reaching a maximum speed of 170 kilometers per hour.

    This year's Brno exhibition is one of the largest in the world. The holding of this exhibition is not only of great significance to the development of industrial technology in Czechoslovakia, but also helps to promote trade relations between Czechoslovakia and other countries. During last year's Brno exhibition, business representatives from sixty-eight countries visited Brno and signed trade agreements with relevant Czechoslovak trade organizations totaling several hundred million crowns. It is expected that more business people from various countries will visit Brno this year. (Ling) (Attached picture)

    捷机器制造业展览会开幕
    展出各种产品达四千多种
    本报讯  捷克斯洛伐克第三届机器制造业展览会从9月1日起开始在布尔诺举行。这次展览会比过去两次展览会更为丰富多采。这次将展出捷克斯洛伐克机器制造业各部门的四千多种产品，室内外的全部展览面积达十一万平方公尺。
    今年展出的工业品有三分之二将是重型机器制造业的产品。其中包括近四百种新产品。精密机器制造业将展出约八十种新产品。汽车工业方面将有十八种新产品。农业机器方面将展出十四种完全新型的农业机器。捷克斯洛伐克新出产的“塔特拉603”型小汽车将是引人注目的展品之一。这种汽车用空气冷却的发动机要比普通类型的发动机轻得多，只有一百六十公斤重。“塔特拉603”型小汽车的燃料消耗量很低（每一百公里只十二点五公升），但速度却很高，每小时可达到一百七十公里的最高速度。
    今年的布尔诺展览会是世界上规模最大的展览会之一。这个展览会的举行，不但对捷克斯洛伐克工业技术的发展具有重要意义，而且也有助于促进捷克斯洛伐克同其他国家的贸易关系。去年的布尔诺展览会期间，曾有六十八个国家的工商界代表访问了布尔诺，并同捷克斯洛伐克有关贸易机构签订了总额达好几亿克朗的贸易协定。预期今年将有更多的各国工商界人士前往布尔诺参观。 （凌）（附图片）
