　　Deliberate Challenge Instigated by the United States
　　Israel and Turkey Deploy Troops on Syrian Border
    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, September 13th: A Syrian military spokesman accused Israeli forces on the evening of September 12th of violating the armistice agreement by entering the demilitarized zone on the Syrian-Israeli border on September 11th.
    The spokesman said that Israeli troops, in three military trucks and six tanks, along with two United Nations vehicles, entered the village of Tawafik in the Syrian-Israeli border demilitarized zone and drove out the local Arab residents. After the Syrian side contacted the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, the Israeli troops withdrew from the village.
    Syrian Acting Defense Minister Azem, when talking about this incident on the 12th, said that Syria is closely monitoring Israel's movements on the Syrian border.
    According to a report in the "Masses Daily" on the 13th, when U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson visited the Middle East, he promised Israel $117 million for use in aggression against Syria. Henderson also assured Israel that if Israel launched an attack on Syria, it would allocate the land bordering Syria and Jordan, inhabited by Arab refugees, to Israel, and grant Israel navigation rights in the Gulf of Aqaba. The newspaper said that the entry of Israeli troops into the demilitarized zone was a provocative act aimed at finding an excuse to attack Syria.
    Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: According to a TASS report on the 13th: Syrian Armed Forces Deputy Chief of Staff Nifuri told "New York Times" reporter Brewer that Turkey is massing troops on the Syrian border under the "instigation" of the United States. He estimated that the assembled forces consisted of two infantry divisions and one armored tank division.
    According to the reporter's report from Damascus, Nifuri also ridiculed the claim that these troops were merely conducting exercises.
    Nifuri said that jet planes of unknown nationality, perhaps American, British, or Turkish planes, have been flying over the Latakia region of northern Syria for the past four days.

　　在美国唆使下蓄意挑战
　　以色列土耳其兵临叙利亚边境
    新华社大马士革13日电  叙利亚军方发言人12日晚间指责以色列军队在9月11日破坏停战协定，进入叙—以边境的非军事区。
    这位发言人说，以色列军队乘着三辆军用卡车和六辆坦克，同两辆联合国车辆一起进入了叙—以边境非军事地区内的塔瓦菲克村，并且赶走了当地的阿拉伯居民。在叙利亚方面同联合停战委员会接触以后，以色列军队退出了这个村子。
    叙利亚代理国防部长阿泽姆12日在谈到这次事件时说，叙利亚正在密切注意以色列在叙利亚边境的动向。
    据“群众报”13日报道，美国副国务卿帮办汉德逊到中东时曾经答应给以色列一亿一千七百万美元作为侵略叙利亚之用。汉德逊还向以色列保证，如果以色列向叙利亚发动进攻，将把叙利亚同约旦交界处一片阿拉伯难民居住的土地划归以色列，并且给予以色列在亚喀巴湾通航的权利。这家报纸说，以色列军队进入非军事区是一种挑衅行为，目的在为进攻叙利亚寻找借口。
    新华社13日讯  据塔斯社13日消息：叙利亚武装部队副参谋长尼福里对“纽约时报”记者布鲁尔说，在美国“唆使”下，土耳其向叙利亚边境集结军队。他估计，集结的军队有两个步兵师和一个装甲坦克师。
    据这位记者从大马士革报道，尼福里还嘲笑了所谓这些军队只是在进行演习的说法。
    尼福里说，国籍不明的喷气式飞机，也许是美国、英国或土耳其的飞机，近四天来在叙利亚北部拉塔基亚地区上空飞行。
