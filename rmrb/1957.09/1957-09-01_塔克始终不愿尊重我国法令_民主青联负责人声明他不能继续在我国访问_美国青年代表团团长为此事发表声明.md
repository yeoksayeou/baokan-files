Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: A spokesperson for the All-China Democratic Youth Federation declared here today that Shelby Tucker, a member of the American youth delegation currently visiting China, will no longer be able to continue his tour of China as a guest of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, due to his refusal to present his passport and complete the necessary procedures for traveling in China.

The spokesperson for the All-China Youth Federation stated that as the Moscow World Youth Festival was nearing its end in August this year, the All-China Youth Federation invited a delegation of fifteen American representatives to visit China. However, the number of American youths who wanted to come to China exceeded this figure at the time. After mutual agreement, an additional twenty-seven American youths were willing to bear their own travel expenses outside of China, and during their visit to China, they would be treated as guests of the All-China Youth Federation, just like the fifteen invited individuals. They arrived in Beijing on August 23rd (one arrived in Beijing on August 28th) and received a warm welcome from the Chinese youth and people. Forty-one of them traveled to the Northeast for sightseeing on August 29th. Unfortunately, one of the members of this delegation, Mr. Shelby Tucker, a twenty-two-year-old student from Oxford University, has been unwilling to present his passport to the relevant Chinese authorities in the past few days to fulfill the procedures that any foreign citizen must complete to travel in China. Despite our repeated urging, he still insists on refusing to complete this procedure. Under these circumstances, the All-China Youth Federation cannot continue to arrange Mr. Tucker's travel itinerary in China. We cannot help but express our greatest regret that Mr. Tucker has consistently refused to respect Chinese authorities' laws and regulations regarding foreign citizens traveling in China.

The other forty-one members of the American youth delegation will continue to visit various places in Central and South China, and most of the members will also participate in the National Day celebrations in Beijing on October 1st.

Shelby Tucker left Beijing by train this afternoon and will exit the country via Manzhouli.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, August 31st: Warren McKenna, the head of the American youth delegation that came to China after attending the Sixth World Youth and Students Festival for Peace and Friendship, issued a statement in Changchun on August 30th regarding the matter of American youth delegation member Shelby Tucker's non-compliance with the regulations on foreign nationals traveling in China. The full text is as follows:

I wish to announce to the group of Americans traveling in China that Shelby Tucker, who until today was a member of our group, will no longer continue our trip in China with us. This is a result of his decision not to comply with the regulations regarding laws on foreign nationals traveling in China. According to what I understand from repeated statements by the Chinese authorities on this matter, all foreign nationals must present their passports within forty-eight hours of entering China to prove their nationality. Due to reasons he holds, which he has informed our hosts, the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, and the Chinese authorities, Shelby felt unable to comply with the specific provisions of the aforementioned law. The Chinese side insists that the regulations apply to everyone. This situation has continued for five days. During this period, our hosts made repeated efforts to resolve this issue. After further efforts failed to achieve a resolution, they informed Shelby that they sincerely regretted that they could not continue to host his stay in China. On the morning of our departure from Beijing, they still hoped to find a way for Shelby to participate in our future travels. It is clear that Shelby will be required by the authorities to leave China. I have been informed that our hosts will continue to provide him with hotel accommodation and entertain him before his departure from China.

    塔克始终不愿尊重我国法令
    民主青联负责人声明他不能继续在我国访问  美国青年代表团团长为此事发表声明
    新华社31日讯  中华全国民主青年联合会负责人今天在这里宣称，现在中国访问的美国青年代表团中一位成员谢耳比·塔克，由于拒绝呈验护照，不肯履行在中国旅行的手续，现在已不可能作为中华全国民主青年联合会的客人，继续逗留在中国参观访问。
    全国青联的负责人说，在今年8月莫斯科世界青年联欢节快结束的时候，中华全国青联邀请了由十五位美国代表组成的代表团访问中国。但是当时要求前来中国的美国青年超过了这个数字。经过双方协议，另外二十七位美国青年愿意自己担负在中国境外的旅费，而在中国访问期间则和其他被邀请的十五人一样作为全国青联的客人，他们已于8月23日抵达北京（有一位是在8月28日抵京），并且受到了中国青年和人民的热情的欢迎。其中四十一人，已在29日前往东北参观。遗憾的是这个代表团的成员之一，二十二岁的牛津大学学生谢耳比·塔克先生在过去几天中一直不愿意向中国有关当局呈验护照，以履行任何外国公民来中国旅行所必须履行的手续。虽然经过我们多次催促，但是他仍坚持拒绝履行这项手续。在这种情况下，全国青联无法继续为塔克先生安排在中国的旅行日程。塔克先生始终不愿尊重中国当局关于外国公民在华旅行的法令，对此我们不能不表示最大的遗憾。
    美国青年代表团的其他四十一位成员以后还将去华中、华南各地参观访问，大部分成员还将在北京参加“十一”国庆节观礼。
    谢耳比·塔克已于今日下午乘火车离京，将由满洲里出境。
    新华社长春31日电  在参加第六届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节后来中国访问的美国青年代表团团长华伦·麦肯纳30日在长春发表关于美国青年代表团团员谢耳比·塔克不遵守关于外国人在华旅行的法律的条例一事发表声明，全文如下：
    我愿向正在中国旅行的一群美国人宣布：到今天为止，还是我们之间成员之一的谢耳比·塔克将不再和我们一起继续我们在中国的旅行。这是由于他决定不遵守关于外国人在华旅行的法律的条例的结果。据我从中国有关这方面迭次的声明中了解，一切外国人在进入中国四十八小时内，必须出示其护照，以证明其国籍。由于他所持理由，这些理由他已告知我们的主人——中华全国民主青年联合会和中国当局，谢耳比感到不能遵守上述法律的专门规定。中国方面坚持条例适用于一切人。这种情况继续了五天。在此期间，我们的主人迭次努力来解决这个问题。在进一步努力仍不能取得解决后，他们告知谢耳比，他们真诚地感到遗憾，不能继续招待他在中国逗留。在我们离开北京的早晨，他们仍希望找寻到办法使谢耳比能参加我们今后的旅行。很明显，谢耳比将被当局要求离开中国。我已得知我们的主人将继续提供他本人旅馆居住条件，并在其离开中国前予以招待。
