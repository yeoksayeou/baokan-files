　　Rightists in Xinjiang say: "We fear nothing, except big-character posters"
    In the anti-Rightist struggle at the Xinjiang August 1st Agricultural College, big-character posters and cartoons played a huge role. Rightists said: "We fear nothing, except big-character posters." The masses called them the "machine guns" and "daggers" in the battle.

    At the beginning of the summer this year, taking advantage of the "blooming and contending" opportunity, the Rightists in the college once used big-character posters to spread various fallacies and launched rampant attacks against the Party and socialism.

    Since the beginning of the anti-Rightist struggle, big-character posters have become a powerful weapon to strike back at the enemy. From August 4th to the beginning of September, the college produced a total of 610 big-character posters, averaging three large sheets of paper each. Among them, 290 were denunciations and 189 were criticisms. The number of people who signed their names on the big-character posters reached more than 1,900, accounting for 99% of the people in the college who participated in the struggle. In addition, there were more than 340 cartoons. Wang Dongying, an associate professor in the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Department and a Rightist, was once a prominent figure during the "blooming and contending" period. He clamored that he would cut off the locomotive and prevent the socialist train from moving forward. When the teachers and students of the whole college fought back against him, 110 big-character posters and 50 cartoons were produced within two days, with more than 900 signatures. When the counterattack against Guan Wuyu, an associate professor in the Water Conservancy Department and a vicious Rightist, began, Guan Wuyu shamelessly wrote a doggerel to excuse and defend himself: "You don't teach physics, you stir up trouble during the blooming, contending; I will participate in the reasoning meeting, and I will definitely defeat the old white hair (Guan Wuyu's hair is white)." The next day, a poem rhyming with his original poem was written on the big-character poster: "You don't teach well, you've always been anti-Party, playing tricks; you know how to win over and strike, a fine scholar, old white hair" to refute him.

　　新疆的右派分子说：“什么都不怕，就怕大字报”
    新疆八一农学院在反右派斗争中，大字报和漫画发挥了极大的作用。右派分子说：“什么都不怕，就怕大字报。”群众称它为战斗中的“机关枪”和“匕首”。
    今年夏初，该院右派分子曾经趁着鸣放的机会，一度利用大字报发出种种谬论，向党向社会主义猖狂地进攻。
    反右派斗争以来，大字报便成了反击敌人的有力武器。该院从8月4日到9月初，共出大字报六百一十份，每份平均三张大纸，其中属于揭发类的二百九十份，属于批判类的一百八十九份。在大字报上签名的人数已达一千九百多人，占全院参加斗争人数的99％，另外还有漫画三百四十多幅。该院畜牧兽医系副教授右派分子王东英，在鸣放期间曾经是风云一时的人物，他扬言要截断火车头，使社会主义的列车无法前进。当全院师生反击他的时候，两天之内就出了大字报一百一十份，漫画五十幅，签名的达九百多人。开始反击水利系副教授穷凶极恶的右派分子关五玉的时候，关五玉还恬不知耻地做了一首打油诗“放着物理你不教，鸣放席上把祸招，今番参加说理会，一定斗垮老白毛（关五玉头发白了）”来为自己解嘲和辩护，第二天，大字报上写了一首和着他原韵的诗：“既不好好把书教，一贯反党耍花招，拉拢打击样样会，好个学者老白毛”加以驳斥。　（沈石）
