Do Not Allow the Reactionary Direction of the Old *Ta Kung Pao* to be Restored
*Ta Kung Pao* Exposes the Conspiracy Activities of Deputy Editor-in-Chief Zhao Enyuan

(Reported by this newspaper) In the anti-rightist struggle, the staff of *Ta Kung Pao* exposed a whole army, a rightist, Deputy Editor-in-Chief Zhao Enyuan, and his wife, Xu Wenlan (a member of the China Democratic League and a staff member of the Finance Section), who were attempting to restore the reactionary bourgeois direction of the old *Ta Kung Pao*, and their anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds. After many persuasive struggles, Zhao Enyuan and Xu Wenlan have initially confessed to the background of their attacks on the Party and some facts.

Zhao Enyuan was the chairman of the China Democratic League branch of *Ta Kung Pao*. When the bourgeois rightists began to launch an attack on the Party, Zhao Enyuan also carried out extensive activities within the newspaper. On May 15th and June 2nd, he took it upon himself to use the name of the China Democratic League branch of *Ta Kung Pao* to hold two inflammatory forums, inciting the masses to attack the Party.

Before the meeting, Zhao Enyuan actively encouraged those invited to attend the meeting to "raise opinions as sharply as possible" and refused League members to participate. At the forum, he announced that the transcript of the speech would be "anonymous" and promised to "keep it secret" for the speakers, encouraging the masses to "pour out their grievances." Then he fabricated facts and told comrades who had previously requested to join the League: "It is not that the League does not accept you, but the Party does not allow it." He wanted to blame the Party organization for the League branch's failure to develop the organization over the years.

Due to Zhao Enyuan's instigation, the forum quickly resounded with shouts of attacking the Party. Some people who had been investigated in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement and those who were dissatisfied with the Party made many remarks at the meeting that obliterated the achievements of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and slandered the Party. Zhao Enyuan openly expressed "complete agreement" with these fallacies at the meeting and also told everyone not to "ignore fundamental issues," inciting the masses to set even bigger fires.

Zhao Enyuan's wife, Xu Wenlan, also incited some people to go to the meeting to complain.

In order to expand the scope of the arson, Zhao Enyuan held a second forum and prepared to convene a third forum for historical counter-revolutionaries who had been investigated in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries.

While fanning the flames, Zhao Enyuan also attempted to recruit troops and horses, "develop" the China Democratic League organization in large numbers, and made emergency arrangements for some League members, advocating that those who had previously verbally applied to join the League should not go through the joining procedures and should immediately participate in "organizational life." It is necessary to absorb over-aged members of the Communist Youth League and other non-Party intellectuals, and develop the number of League members to seventy or eighty in order to confront the Party.

Zhao Enyuan's frenzied attack on the Party was malicious. He admitted that holding a forum to set fire was to "smear" and "discredit" the Party in order to realize his conspiracy. He advocated "absorbing more non-Party members to participate in the editorial board" and opposed discussing "finished products" in the editorial board in order to weaken the Party's leadership and achieve his goal of tampering with the political direction of *Ta Kung Pao* and reliving his old dream of controlling the editorial power of the Tianjin *Ta Kung Pao* before liberation. In the conspiracy activities of the rightists in the newspaper to restore the old *Ta Kung Pao*, Zhao Enyuan played the role of an eager vanguard.

Before liberation, Zhao Enyuan was the editor-in-chief of the Tianjin *Ta Kung Pao*. He always used his power to suppress progressive editors and reporters, arbitrarily withheld many manuscripts that exposed the darkness of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, colluded with Kuomintang secret agents, and ran for the pseudo-senator of Tianjin. In the eight years since liberation, Zhao Enyuan has received much care and help from the Party, but he has not carried out ideological transformation well and has retained his reactionary ideological stance to this day.

    不准复辟旧大公报的反动方向
    大公报揭露副总编辑赵恩源的阴谋活动
    本报讯　在反右派斗争中，大公报工作人员揭发了企图复辟旧大公报的反动资产阶级方向的一路大军、右派分子、副总编辑赵恩源和他的妻子徐文兰（民盟盟员、财务科科员）的反党反社会主义言行。经过多次说理斗争，赵恩源和徐文兰已初步交代了向党进攻的背景和一些事实。
    赵恩源是民盟大公报支部的主任委员。当资产阶级右派分子开始向党发动进攻的时候，赵恩源也在报社内部大肆活动起来。5月15日和6月2日，他擅自盗用民盟大公报支部名义，举行了两次放火的座谈会，煽动群众向党进攻。
    赵恩源在会前积极鼓动应邀参加会的人“提意见越尖锐越好”，并拒绝盟内党员参加。在座谈会上，他宣布发言记录“不记名”，保证为发言人“保密”，鼓动群众“吐苦水”，然后他捏造事实，向曾经要求入盟的同志说：“不是盟不吸收，而是党不允许”。他想把民盟支部几年来没有发展组织的责任归罪于党组织。
    由于赵恩源的煽动，座谈会很快就响起一片向党进攻的叫嚣。某些在肃反运动中被审查过的对象和对党有不满情绪的人，在会上发表了许多抹杀肃反成绩、诋毁党的言论。对这些谬论，赵恩源在会上公开表示“完全同意”还叫大家不要把“带有根本性的问题忽略过去”，煽动群众放更大的火。
    赵恩源的妻子徐文兰还煽动一些人到会上去诉苦。
    赵恩源为了扩大放火范围，又举行了第二次座谈会，并准备召集在肃反中被清查出来的历史反革命分子举行第三次座谈会。
    赵恩源在煽风点火的同时，还企图招兵买马，大量“发展”民盟组织，向部分盟员作了紧急布置，主张让以前曾口头申请入盟的人，不必办理入盟手续，马上即可参加 “组织生活”。要吸收超龄团员和其他党外知识分子，把盟员人数发展到七八十人，以便和党抗衡。
    赵恩源如此猖狂向党进攻是别有用心的。他承认召开座谈会放火，是为了把党“抹黑”、“搞臭”，以便实现他的阴谋。他主张“多吸收一些党外人士参加编委会”，反对在编委会上讨论“成品”，以便削弱党的领导力量，达到他篡改大公报政治方向的目的，重温他解放前掌握天津大公报编辑大权的旧梦。在报社内右派分子复辟旧大公报的阴谋活动中，赵恩源充当了急先锋的角色。
    赵恩源在解放前是天津大公报的编辑主任，一贯利用职权压制进步的编辑记者，把许多揭露国民党反动统治的黑暗的稿件任意扣发，勾结国民党特务分子，竞选天津市伪参议员。解放八年来，赵恩源受到了党的多方照顾和帮助，但他一直没有很好地进行思想改造，把他的反动思想立场一直保留到现在。
