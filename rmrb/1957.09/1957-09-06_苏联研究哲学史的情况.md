Academic Trends

    The Soviet philosophical circles have paid much attention to the research work on the history of philosophy in recent years. The Institute of Philosophy of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has listed the research on the history of philosophy as one of the key points of the research work.
    The research work on the history of philosophy in the Soviet Union is mainly carried out around the compilation of the "World History of Philosophy". The Institute of Philosophy of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has gathered many famous historians of philosophy to collectively compile the four-volume "World History of Philosophy". The first two volumes of the book are about the history of philosophy before Marxism and have been published. At present, the focus of the research work on the history of philosophy in Soviet philosophical circles is on the philosophy of the Marxist-Leninist stage, which is the main content of the latter two volumes of the book. In this part of the narrative on the history of philosophy from the nineteenth to the twentieth century, not only the Marxist-Leninist philosophy is expounded, but also the revolutionary democrats of the nineteenth century and various idealist philosophies of modern bourgeoisie are discussed. This four-volume "World History of Philosophy" fundamentally corrects some of the main shortcomings of the three-volume "History of Western European Philosophy" written by Aleksandrov in the past, such as not treating the history of philosophy as the history of the struggle between materialism and idealism, obliterating the great revolutionary significance of Marxist philosophy, and neglecting the history of the development of Russian and Eastern philosophy. Therefore, it can be said that this is a great work that correctly applies the Marxist viewpoint to compile the world history of philosophy.
    In the process of compiling the "World History of Philosophy", the two-volume "History of Philosophy of the Soviet Nationalities" was published. In addition, a special book on the development of Marxist-Leninist philosophy in the history of Russian philosophy is being prepared for publication, in order to further deepen the research work on the philosophy of the Marxist-Leninist stage that is currently underway.
    The Soviet Union has always attached great importance to the research on the history of Western philosophy. From ancient Greece to the philosophical works of various European countries in the nineteenth century, whether idealistic or materialistic, most of them have been translated into Russian. In particular, the works on French materialism have not only been fully translated, but also special studies have been carried out on some of the more famous philosophers and their works, and special books have been published. Regarding German classical philosophy, almost all of them have been translated, and some people are conducting special research and have published some research works.
    The research on the history of Eastern philosophy has also begun to be strengthened recently. At present, the historical materials of philosophy of various Eastern countries are being sorted out and translated, and some theoretical research is being carried out at the same time. Among the Eastern countries, in addition to Egypt, Iran, and India, they pay special attention to the study of Chinese philosophy, and are now actively sorting out the historical materials of Chinese philosophy. With the cooperation of Chinese philosophers, they will complete the publication of the Selected Works of Chinese Philosophy (a total of six volumes) in 1958, and the parts of the pre-Qin and Han dynasties have been translated into Russian.

    苏联研究哲学史的情况
    苏联哲学界近几年来很重视关于哲学史方面的研究工作，苏联科学院哲学研究所已把哲学史方面的研究列入研究工作的重点之一。
    苏联在哲学史方面的研究工作，主要是围绕“世界哲学史”的编写工作来进行的。苏联哲学研究所正集中了许多著名的哲学史家集体编写四卷本的“世界哲学史”巨著。该书的前两卷内容是关于马克思主义以前的哲学史，已经出版。目前苏联哲学界哲学史研究工作的重点，是关于马克思列宁阶段的哲学，这也就是该书后两卷的主要内容。在这部分叙述从十九世纪到二十世纪的哲学史中，不仅阐述了马克思列宁主义哲学，也论述了十九世纪的革命民主派及现代资产阶级各种唯心主义哲学。这部四卷本“世界哲学史”从根本上纠正了过去亚历山大洛夫所著三卷本“西欧哲学史”一书中，不把哲学史当成唯物主义与唯心主义斗争的历史、抹杀马克思主义哲学的伟大革命意义、忽视俄国和东方哲学发展史等一些主要缺点。因此，可以说，这是一部正确运用马克思主义观点编写世界哲学史的巨著。
    在编写“世界哲学史”的过程中，出版了两卷本的“苏联各民族哲学史”。此外，还准备出版一本关于马克思列宁主义哲学在俄国哲学史的发展的专著，以便进一步加深目前正在进行的关于马克思列宁阶段哲学的研究工作。
    苏联对西方哲学史方面的研究历来十分重视。从古代希腊到十九世纪欧洲各国的哲学著作，不论是唯心主义的或唯物主义的，大都已有了俄文译本，特别是关于法国唯物主义的著作，不仅全部译出，而且对较著名一些的哲学家及其著作，有了专门的研究并出版了专书。关于德国古典哲学，也几乎全部有了译本，并有人在进行专门的研究，出版了一些研究著作。
    对东方哲学史的研究近来也开始加强。目前正在整理、翻译东方各国的哲学史资料，同时进行一些理论研究。东方各国中，除埃及、伊朗、印度以外，他们特别注意对中国哲学的研究，现在正积极整理中国哲学史资料。在我国哲学家的合作下，他们将在1958年完成中国哲学著作选集（共六卷）的出版，现已将先秦、两汉部分译成了俄文。（艾南）
