　　Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The Ministry of Culture and its affiliated units have solved more than a thousand problems, both large and small, in their work over the past two months. Staff members have commented, "This is a good phenomenon after the rectification campaign."

　　Many units, while most leaders were concentrated on participating in the anti-rightist struggle, also allocated necessary resources to study and resolve some relatively important issues in their operations. For example, the Publication Affairs Administration strengthened the planning of publishing work, paying attention to reducing shortcomings such as book duplication, inventory backlogs, and shortages of some books. The procedures for deciding the number of books to be printed have also been clearly defined, with the publisher determining the print run and the bookstore determining the number of orders. In order to cater to the needs of experts and academic research, relevant publishing houses have reprinted two to three hundred academic books and classic works. Improvements have also been made in printing factory management and the timely publication of newspapers. In addition, units such as the Film Distribution Company and the Film Equipment Company have improved the import and export of film copies and the inspection system for imported machinery and instruments. During this period, various units have made more improvements in the work of employee welfare, salary and benefits, and the use of cadres, and have also properly handled the remaining issues from the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. In terms of cadre work and salary treatment, all units conducted inspections based on the opinions of the masses. In the past, the arrangements and grading and salary assessment of cadres were basically correct and reasonable. Individual problems have been dealt with based on the opinions of the masses and in accordance with personal voluntariness, only demoting party members and not demoting the masses. All units also sorted out the criticisms and opinions of the masses on the ideological style of the leaders during the rectification campaign and handed them over to the individuals concerned for reference in their self-criticism.

　　文化部系统已解决问题一千多个
    据新华社15日讯  文化部及所属单位在两个月来已经解决了工作中的大小问题一千多个，职工们反映，“这是整风后的好现象”。
    许多单位在多数领导人集中参加反右派斗争的情况下，还抽出必要的力量，研究解决了一些业务上比较重要的问题。如出版事业管理
  局加强了出版工作的计划性，注意减少了出书重复、发行积压以及部分书籍脱销等缺点。对书籍印数的决定程序，也明确规定了由出版社决定印数、书店决定订货数的办法。为了照顾专家和学术研究的需要，有关出版社已重印学术性书籍和经典著作二、三百种。在印刷厂管理工作和按时出版报纸等方面，也作了改进。此外，电影发行公司、电影器材公司等单位改进了拷贝的进出口工作和进口机械、仪器的检验制度等。这一时期，各单位对职工生活福利、工资待遇、干部使用等方面的工作改进较多，对肃反的遗留问题也作了妥善处理。在干部工作、工资待遇方面，各单位都根据群众意见进行了检查，过去对干部的安排和评级评薪等工作基本上是正确的、合理的，个别有问题的，已根据群众意见并按照本人自愿，只降党员、不降群众的原则，进行了处理。各单位还把整风中群众对领导人思想作风的批评和意见分别整理交给本人，供领导人进行自我检查的参考。
