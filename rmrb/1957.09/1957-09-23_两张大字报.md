    Two Big-Character Posters
    Eliminate the Five Diseases
    A scene of chaos and disorder.
    Two major skills: 1. Principle-based leadership. 2. Holding meetings and evading responsibility.
    Three insufficiencies: Insufficient understanding of cadres. Insufficient care for the lives of workers. Insufficient listening to the opinions of the masses.
    Four incompetencies: Incompetent in using cadres. Incompetent in training cadres. Incompetent in doing specific work. Incompetent in going deep into the lower levels.
    Five addictions: Addicted to a large staff and great authority. Addicted to having many people to make things easy. Addicted to having special personnel responsible for everything, big or small. Addicted to keeping some mobile personnel for copying and writing. Addicted to keeping some mobile forces to cope with central tasks.
    Those suffering from the above diseases should seek medical treatment promptly. The prescription is as follows:
    1. Thoroughly break with conservative thinking. 2. Dismantle the bureaucratic airs. 3. Appropriately do some specific work. 4. Improve work style. 5. On the basis of not affecting production, drastically improve business and reduce institutions.
    Catalyst: Run enterprises diligently and thriftily, streamline 30% to 50%. Diagnosed by Yu Quanshan

    Please Leaders, Give Me Some Work!
    In a situation where there is fundamentally no need for a clerk, the bureaucratic Cadre Section transferred me from the Security Section to the Technical Section to work as a clerk under the secretary.
    In August, I received my salary twice. In September, I received my salary and bonus once each, and nothing else. I really can't find a way to pass the time every day. My spirit is very uncomfortable. I hope the leaders can give me some work. I have requested this several times, but the Cadre Section and the personnel staff of the Technical Section have replied that it cannot be resolved. Now I can only ask the Deputy Factory Director in charge of personnel to resolve it!

    两张大字报
    除五病
    一片忙乱无序。
    二大技能：一、原则领导。二、开会扯皮。
    三不够：了解干部不够。关心职工生活不够。听群众意见不够。
    四不善于：不善于使用干部。不善于培养干部。不善于作具体工作。不善于深入下层。
    五个嗜好：好人马众多权威大。好人多好办事。好事无大小专人负专责。好留点机动人员抄抄写写。好留点机动力量应付中心工作。
    劝患有以上病者应从速医疗。处方如下：
    一、彻底打破保守思想。二、拆掉官僚架子。三、适当作些具体工作。四、改进工作作风。五、在不影响生产的基础上大刀阔斧的改进业务，削减机构。

    请领导给点工作吧！
    在根本不需要事务员的情况下，官僚主义的干部科，便将我由安全科调到技术科作秘书下的事务员。
    8月份发了两次工资。9月份发了一次工资一次奖金，别无什么事情。每天的时间我真没办法混过去。我的精神很不好受，希望领导能给我一点工作，曾先后多次要求，干部科和技术科人事员均答不能解决，现在只有请人事副厂长给解决一下吧！
