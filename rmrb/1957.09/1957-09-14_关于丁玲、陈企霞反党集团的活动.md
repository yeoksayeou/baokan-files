中華全國民主婦女聯合會副主席许广平在全国妇代会上的发言:

Speech by Xu Guangping, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, at the National Women's Congress:

　　现在我介绍一下丁玲、陈企霞反党集团的问题
Now I will introduce the issue of the Ding Ling and Chen Qixia Anti-Party Clique.

　　（一）
(I)

    丁玲、陈企霞集团在文艺界进行了一系列的反党活动，他们长期拒绝党的领导和监督。1955年作家协会党组扩大会揭露与批判了丁、陈反党小集团的活动。两年来他们不但没有认识和改正自己的错误，反而继续进行反党活动，并企图在整风中翻案。这个反党集团，是以丁玲为首的文艺界中的一爿黑店。没有丁玲的挂帅，陈企霞的大旗是摇摆不起来的。丁玲住在北京多福巷十六号，围绕着她居住的还有这个集团中的人。有人称多福巷十六号为“裴多菲俱乐部”，从这里经常吹起一股黑风。某人党性强，他们就说“这个人是为做官”；某人靠拢党，他们就说“这人拍马屁”；谁公开骂领导，他们就说“这人有胆量，敢说话”；谁因为条件不够不能入党，他们就说这是“党的关门主义”；甚至有人因为乱搞男女关系而受到党的批评，他们就说“这人家庭生活没有幸福”。
The Ding Ling and Chen Qixia clique carried out a series of anti-Party activities in literary and art circles, and they refused the leadership and supervision of the Party for a long time. The enlarged meeting of the Party group of the Writers Association in 1955 exposed and criticized the activities of the Ding and Chen Anti-Party Clique. Over the past two years, they have not only failed to recognize and correct their mistakes, but have continued to engage in anti-Party activities and attempted to reverse their verdicts during the rectification campaign. This anti-Party clique is a sinister den in literary and art circles, headed by Ding Ling. Without Ding Ling's leadership, Chen Qixia's banner could not be waved. Ding Ling lived at No. 16 Duofu Lane in Beijing, and people from this clique also lived around her. Some people called No. 16 Duofu Lane the "Petőfi Club," and a black wind often blew from here. If someone had a strong sense of Party spirit, they would say, "This person is trying to become an official." If someone approached the Party, they would say, "This person is flattering." If someone openly scolded the leaders, they would say, "This person has the courage to speak." If someone could not join the Party because they did not meet the requirements, they would say it was "the Party's closed-door policy." Even if someone was criticized by the Party for having illicit affairs, they would say, "This person does not have a happy family life."

    这个集团的活动方式是十分卑鄙的。他们对人宣传说要讲友情，讲道义，讲诚恳；但是他们对党无情，不讲道义，不讲诚恳。他们讽刺靠拢党的人是“拍马屁，往上爬”，反党的却是“英雄”；在会上公开发言是“卑鄙无耻”，在背后攻击党、骂人，反而是“光荣”；他们进行反党的勾当，说“工作是光荣的”，但别人做些正当的工作，就说这是“往上爬，假积极”。为了达到反党的目的，他们不择手段。从这次揭发出来的材料看，他们利用一些同志对他们的真相不清楚，而冒充好人；利用党在某些工作中的缺点对党进行攻击，却扬言他们是在为真理而斗争；利用有些人对党不满而贩卖他们的所谓同情；利用有些同志的温情主义来找寻对他们的支持；利用同志们在工作中一些正常的不同意见来制造不和；利用有些人对他们的好心爱护而作为进攻党的资本。他们明拉暗扯一些臭味相投的人，鬼鬼祟祟，在一起言不及义——言不及社会主义。这个集团中的一些走卒，为了拉拢别人，使用的手法达到令了人作呕的地步：你要是画家，他就说你画的好；你要是作家，他就说你写的好；你要是青年，他就说你有前途；你要是老年人，他就说你有修养。总之，他们一心一意的利用各种机会进行反党的勾当，企图分裂文艺战线的统一和团结，破坏文学的社会主义方向，阻碍党的方针、政策在文艺界贯彻执行。从地方到北京总有那么一条线，在和党的方针、政策对抗。以前大家不清楚是什么道理，现在才明白原来有丁玲、陈企霞、冯雪峰这个反党集团在作怪。我们必须粉碎这个集团，保卫文学事业的社会主义方向和巩固党的领导。
The activities of this clique are extremely despicable. They promote friendship, morality, and sincerity to others, but they are ruthless to the Party, and do not speak of morality or sincerity. They satirize those who approach the Party as "flattering and climbing up," while those who oppose the Party are "heroes." Public speaking at meetings is "despicable and shameless," while attacking the Party and scolding people behind their backs is "glorious." They say that "work is glorious" when they are engaged in anti-Party activities, but when others do legitimate work, they say it is "climbing up and feigning enthusiasm." In order to achieve their anti-Party goals, they use all means possible. According to the materials revealed this time, they take advantage of some comrades who do not know the truth about them and pretend to be good people; they attack the Party by taking advantage of shortcomings in certain areas of the Party's work, claiming that they are fighting for the truth; they exploit some people's dissatisfaction with the Party to peddle their so-called sympathy; they exploit some comrades' sentimentalism to seek their support; they use some normal differences of opinion among comrades at work to create discord; and they use some people's kind concern for them as capital to attack the Party. They openly and secretly rope in some like-minded people, acting furtively and engaging in pointless talk—talk that does not concern socialism. Some of the lackeys in this clique use methods to win over others that are sickening: if you are a painter, they say you paint well; if you are a writer, they say you write well; if you are young, they say you have a future; if you are old, they say you are cultivated. In short, they single-mindedly use all kinds of opportunities to engage in anti-Party activities, attempting to split the unity and solidarity of the literary and art front, undermine the socialist direction of literature, and hinder the implementation of the Party's policies in literary and art circles. From the local level to Beijing, there is always a line that opposes the Party's policies. People didn't understand the reason before, but now they understand that the Ding Ling, Chen Qixia, and Feng Xuefeng anti-Party clique is the culprit. We must smash this clique, defend the socialist direction of literature, and consolidate the Party's leadership.

    （二）
(II)

    丁玲是这个集团的头子。我在这里向大家报告一下她的反党言行。
Ding Ling is the leader of this clique. Here, I will report to you on her anti-Party words and deeds.

    她是一个名作家，但不是以文艺为武器、为工具来为人民服务，为我们的社会主义建设服务的；而却是提倡“一本书主义”。她主张“一个人有了一本书，便有了一切，谁也打不倒他。”有人没有机会出国，她便挑拨说：“不叫你出国，因为你没有一本书。”谁觉得没有被领导重视，她便说“因为你没有一本书”。她也曾对我说：“你就是做了很多工作，算得了什么呢？写东西才是自己的。”就这样她到处宣传一本书主义，叫人家不要勤勤恳恳接受党交给的任务，好好去工作；却叫人家专为个人的名利进行写作。
She is a famous writer, but she does not use literature and art as a weapon or tool to serve the people and our socialist construction; instead, she advocates "one-bookism." She advocates that "a person who has a book has everything, and no one can defeat him." If someone does not have the opportunity to go abroad, she instigates by saying, "They won't let you go abroad because you don't have a book." If someone feels that they are not valued by the leadership, she says, "Because you don't have a book." She once said to me, "Even if you do a lot of work, what does it count for? Writing is what's truly yours." In this way, she promotes one-bookism everywhere, telling people not to diligently accept the tasks assigned by the Party and work hard; instead, she tells people to write solely for personal fame and gain.

    丁玲极端骄傲，目空一切，虚伪、骄横、个人征服一切的反动思想渗透了她。在文学讲习所里，挂她个人的照片，在她家里，她把托尔斯泰的照片和自己的照片并排挂在一起。自封为世界上的伟大作家之一。她自己向人说：在苏联、外国朋友不愿见周扬而愿见她。她曾向别人表示，苏联有一位著名作家拿周立波的“暴风骤雨”和她的“太阳照在桑干河上”这两本小说相提并论很不应该，好像这样就使她受了侮辱，她曾在自己编的文艺报上发表苏联同志讨论她的作品的消息，借以为自己捧场。她对我们党内外作家都看不起。对郭沫若、茅盾、老舍这样的大作家都不尊重，对赵树理同志很看不起。她一再对人说“为什么老把赵树理压在我的头上。”其实，从来也没有任何人把赵树理压在她的头上，倒是她想尽方法来打击赵树理同志。她不但拿文学当个人获取名利的资本，而且拿它来作反党的工具。她在自己负责的如文艺报和文学讲习所里搞独立王国，在这个王国内，不允许任何人批评。在她主编时期的文艺报，经常和“人民文学”唱对台戏，常常借故批评“人民文学”，破坏两个编辑部的团结。1954年，有人匿名写文章攻击赵树理、周立波、刘白羽等，把这一匿名稿同时投给“人民文学”“文艺报”，丁玲知道这个情况后，非常高兴地说，“如果他们（指人民文学）不发表，我们就把它当法宝抛出去”。同是在党领导下的刊物，而丁玲竟恶意的看待它。
Ding Ling is extremely arrogant, looks down on everyone, and is permeated with the reactionary idea of hypocrisy, arrogance, and individual conquest. In the Literary Institute, her personal photo is hung. In her home, she hangs Tolstoy's photo side by side with her own. She proclaims herself as one of the world's great writers. She herself told people that in the Soviet Union, foreign friends were unwilling to meet with Zhou Yang but were willing to meet with her. She once told others that it was very inappropriate for a famous Soviet writer to compare Zhou Libo's "Hurricane" with her "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River," as if it were an insult to her. She once published news in her own Wenyi Bao about Soviet comrades discussing her works, using it to promote herself. She despises all writers inside and outside our Party. She does not respect great writers like Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, and Lao She, and she looks down on Comrade Zhao Shuli. She repeatedly said to people, "Why do they always put Zhao Shuli above me?" In fact, no one has ever put Zhao Shuli above her; on the contrary, she tried every means to attack Comrade Zhao Shuli. She not only uses literature as capital for personal fame and gain, but also uses it as a tool against the Party. She runs an independent kingdom in the Wenyi Bao and the Literary Institute, which she is in charge of, and no one is allowed to criticize her in this kingdom. During her time as editor-in-chief of the Wenyi Bao, she often sang a different tune from Renmin Wenxue, often criticizing Renmin Wenxue on purpose, undermining the unity of the two editorial departments. In 1954, someone anonymously wrote an article attacking Zhao Shuli, Zhou Libo, Liu Baiyu, and others, and submitted this anonymous manuscript to both Renmin Wenxue and Wenyi Bao. After Ding Ling learned of this, she said very happily, "If they (referring to Renmin Wenxue) don't publish it, we will throw it out as a magic weapon." The publications are both under the leadership of the Party, but Ding Ling views it with malice.

    丁玲是一个党员，但在她的思想里却没有组织，没有纪律，公开提倡“骄傲是美德”。她曾向青年人说：“你们骄傲一点不算什么，我年青的时候，比你们还骄傲呢！”她的作品任何人都不能批评，有人曾经写文章批评了她写的“太阳照在桑干河上”，她就无中生有地说这个人是“周扬的高足”，是为了打击她。经过这次揭露证实这个人还是跟他们在一起密谋筹办“同人刊物”的，那里是别人有意组织文章来打击她呢？她骄傲自满，目空一切，发展到了登峰造极的地步。彭真同志略为批评了“太阳照在桑干河上”，她就对彭真同志非常不满，见了彭真同志都不愿打一个招呼。她心目中还有党吗？
Ding Ling is a Party member, but in her mind, there is no organization, no discipline, and she openly advocates that "pride is a virtue." She once said to young people, "It's nothing for you to be a little proud; when I was young, I was even more proud than you!" No one can criticize her works. Someone once wrote an article criticizing her "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River," and she fabricated that this person was "Zhou Yang's top student" and was trying to attack her. After this exposure, it was confirmed that this person was still conspiring with them to prepare a "magazine for like-minded people." How could others intentionally organize articles to attack her? Her pride, complacency, and disregard for everyone have reached their peak. Comrade Peng Zhen slightly criticized "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River," and she became very dissatisfied with Comrade Peng Zhen, and was unwilling to even greet Comrade Peng Zhen when she saw him. Does she still have the Party in her heart?

    （三）
(III)

    前面说过，丁玲在文艺界，培植个人势力，建立独立王国，1955年秋天，作家协会党组举行扩大会议，把丁玲、陈企霞反党集团的盖子给揭开了。但是自从去年，匈牙利事件发生后特别是今年整风以来，他们认为有机可乘，于是又卑鄙的阴谋进行翻案勾当。这个反党集团的成员，到处制造谣言，准备翻案。说什么“丁、陈事情的发生，是由于丁玲写了‘太阳照在桑干河上’得到了斯大林奖金，有了国际声誉，因此别人嫉妒了，才整她的。”企图用攻击个人的方法，达到反党的目的，用淆乱黑白，混淆是非的方法来模糊群众的认识。
As mentioned earlier, Ding Ling has cultivated personal power and established an independent kingdom in literary and art circles. In the autumn of 1955, the Party group of the Writers Association held an enlarged meeting, which exposed the Ding Ling and Chen Qixia Anti-Party Clique. But since last year, after the Hungarian incident occurred, and especially since the rectification campaign this year, they believe that there are opportunities to take advantage of, so they are engaging in despicable conspiracies to reverse their verdicts. The members of this anti-Party clique are spreading rumors everywhere, preparing to reverse their verdicts. They say that "the Ding and Chen incident occurred because Ding Ling wrote 'The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River' and won the Stalin Prize, gaining international fame, so others became jealous and attacked her." They attempt to achieve their anti-Party goals by attacking individuals, using methods of confusing right and wrong to blur the masses' understanding.

    整风开始以后，丁玲有步骤、有计划的先派遣她的党羽在党组会上放炮，然后看到时机成熟，便亲自出马，猖狂地对党进攻。
After the rectification campaign began, Ding Ling systematically and planfully dispatched her henchmen to fire shots at the Party group meetings, and then, seeing that the time was ripe, she personally came forward and launched a frenzied attack on the Party.

    她先向到会同志诉苦，她说：“戴了反党小集团的帽子，不敢走出多福巷，不愿参加会议，如人代会、妇代会、学习会等”。这是一种污蔑，是一种歪曲，1955年党虽然对她进行了批评，但并未限制过她的任何活动，相反的倒是对她很照顾，她要到那里就到那里，要见什么人就见什么人。她到过四川、云南等地，许多学校还请她讲演，许多报纸还请她写文章，这怎么能说由于“戴了反党小集团的帽子”就没有自由和地位呢？至于人代会、妇代会、学习会等，是她听信冯雪峰等人的教唆，故意不来参加。难道这不正是表示了她对党的抗拒态度吗？
She first complained to the comrades present, saying, "Wearing the hat of an anti-Party clique, I dare not leave Duofu Lane, and I am unwilling to attend meetings, such as the People's Congress, the Women's Congress, and study sessions." This is slander, a distortion. Although the Party criticized her in 1955, it did not restrict any of her activities. On the contrary, it took great care of her. She could go wherever she wanted, and see whoever she wanted. She has been to Sichuan, Yunnan, and other places, and many schools have invited her to give lectures, and many newspapers have invited her to write articles. How can it be said that she has no freedom or status because she is "wearing the hat of an anti-Party clique"? As for the People's Congress, the Women's Congress, study sessions, etc., she deliberately refused to participate after listening to the instigation of Feng Xuefeng and others. Doesn't this precisely show her resistant attitude towards the Party?

    丁玲是一个作家，她懂得“被迫害者”这种字眼容易打动人的心弦，容易博得人们的同情。因此，这次她口口声声伪作委屈的诉说她是“贫雇农”，她是失无可失的无产阶级，她是刚从坟墓里爬出来的人，仿佛她既然是“贫雇农”、“无产阶级”、“被迫害者”，那么党就成了“地主”、“资本家”、“迫害者”了。多么恶毒的词句啊！她一再地说：“我是刚刚从坟墓里爬出来的人，能有工作条件就行，个人绝不追究责任。”好像党犯了什么错误，她却宽宏大量不再追究责任了。其实，她的威风却真不小呢？在一次会议上，她问：“党组都是那些人？”人家一一告诉了她以后，她马上转身说：“陈明记上”。她气势汹汹，想要一个一个的来整他们呢，请看，这不是威胁党是什么呢？
Ding Ling is a writer, and she understands that the term "victim" easily touches people's hearts and easily wins people's sympathy. Therefore, this time she repeatedly feigned grievance, claiming that she was a "poor peasant," that she was a proletarian with nothing to lose, that she was someone who had just crawled out of the grave, as if since she was a "poor peasant," a "proletarian," and a "victim," then the Party had become a "landlord," a "capitalist," and a "persecutor." What vicious words! She repeatedly said, "I am someone who has just crawled out of the grave. It's enough to have working conditions. I will never hold anyone personally responsible." As if the Party had made some mistake, but she was magnanimous and no longer held anyone responsible. In fact, her power is not small at all. At one meeting, she asked, "Who are all the members of the Party group?" After people told her one by one, she immediately turned around and said, "Chen Ming, write them down." She was aggressive and wanted to attack them one by one. Look, isn't this a threat to the Party?

    她自己觉得她了不起，搞反党集团有资本，因此，对一位党组负责同志威胁说：“不团结我这个人，把我踢出文艺界，把我搞得很臭，不要紧。但文艺界总要团结，党总要团结的。”仿佛没有她，文艺界就不能团结，党就不能团结，地球也不能按照规律来运动了。
She felt that she was remarkable and had the capital to form an anti-Party clique. Therefore, she threatened a responsible comrade of the Party group, saying, "It doesn't matter if you don't unite with me, kick me out of the literary and art circles, and make me stink. But the literary and art circles must be united, and the Party must be united." As if without her, the literary and art circles could not be united, the Party could not be united, and the Earth could not move according to its laws.

    不是党要把她搞臭，倒是她要想尽方法企图把党攻倒。她组织反党集团，在这个集团中间，她活像一个武则天，有军师、有文臣武将、有打手，又有通讯员和联络员。有自己的“作家”、“理论家”、“诗人”、“杂文作者”……那么一大堆。他们的思想里都有浓厚的阶级异己分子的敌对思想因素。他们专讲个人第一主义，吹吹拍拍，拉拉扯扯，擅长小广播，播送流言蜚语，找各种机会来对党进攻。
It is not the Party that wants to make her stink, but she who wants to try every means to attack and overthrow the Party. She organized an anti-Party clique, and in this clique, she is like a Wu Zetian, with strategists, civil and military officials, thugs, and also correspondents and liaisons. She has her own "writers," "theorists," "poets," "essayists"... such a large group. Their thoughts are full of hostile ideological elements of class alien elements. They only talk about personal firstism, flattering each other, pulling each other along, specializing in small-scale broadcasting, spreading rumors, and finding all kinds of opportunities to attack the Party.

    丁玲的反党活动，是打着所谓反对宗派主义的幌子来进行的。她曾经说，她要“通天通地”，所谓“通天”就是指向中央告状，所谓“通地”就是指发动群众。因为照她说来，文艺界的领导同志是“瞒上欺下”的，中央和群众都受了他们的“蒙蔽”了。从这次揭发的材料来看，这完全是一派谎言。有的同志指出，你说中央不了解文艺情况，那么武训传问题、红楼梦研究问题、胡风问题、草木篇和“电影锣鼓”等问题不是中央提出又是谁提出来的呢？而且丁玲口口声声说她只反对个别领导同志，那么她写的“三八节有感”与发表的“野百合花”也只是为了反对这些个别领导同志吗？再说你要发动群众，为什么你们用阴蔽的鬼鬼祟祟的方法来对付党呢？为什么胡风害怕“公家人”，而你共产党员丁玲也害怕自己的所作所为被公务员知道呢？实际上他们反党言行已经公开暴露无遗了，他们的党羽李又然曾对陈企霞说：“我要杀人！”陈企霞说：“我真想放火！”李又然又说：“我现在才体会到打渔杀家中的一句台词‘要杀他的全家，方消我心头之恨’的情绪。”请看，这只是反对个别领导同志吗？
Ding Ling's anti-Party activities are carried out under the guise of so-called opposition to sectarianism. She once said that she wanted to "connect to the heavens and connect to the earth." The so-called "connecting to the heavens" means appealing to the central government, and the so-called "connecting to the earth" means mobilizing the masses. Because according to her, the leading comrades in the literary and art circles are "deceiving those above and deceiving those below," and the central government and the masses have been "deceived" by them. According to the materials revealed this time, this is completely a pack of lies. Some comrades pointed out, "You say that the central government does not understand the situation in the literary and art circles, so who raised the issues of 'The Life of Wu Xun,' the study of 'Dream of the Red Chamber,' the Hu Feng case, 'Cao Mu Pian,' and 'The Movie Gong and Drum' if not the central government?" Moreover, Ding Ling repeatedly said that she only opposed individual leading comrades, so were her "Thoughts on March 8th" and the published "Wild Lily" only for opposing these individual leading comrades? Furthermore, you want to mobilize the masses, so why do you use covert and furtive methods to deal with the Party? Why was Hu Feng afraid of "public servants," and why was you, the Communist Party member Ding Ling, also afraid of your actions being known by civil servants? In fact, their anti-Party words and deeds have been completely exposed. Their henchman Li Youran once said to Chen Qixia, "I want to kill people!" Chen Qixia said, "I really want to set a fire!" Li Youran also said, "Now I understand the emotion of the line in 'The Fisherman's Revenge,' 'To kill his entire family is the only way to eliminate the hatred in my heart.'" Look, is this just opposing individual leading comrades?

    丁玲不但在党内进行活动，而且勾结文汇报，企图里应外合向党夹攻。她做好圈套，先使她的党羽柳溪到文汇报去泄漏所谓“丁陈事件”的底，然后等文汇报浦熙修和姚芳藻来了以后又故意说“这事你去问邵荃麟他们，他们党组知道。”企图用这办法来对党将一军，迫使党在人们眼睛尚未擦亮以前向社会上宣布所谓“丁陈事件的底”。用心之险可谓毒之极矣！
Ding Ling not only carries out activities within the Party, but also colludes with Wenhui Bao, attempting to launch a pincer attack on the Party from within and without. She set up a trap, first having her henchman Liu Xi go to Wenhui Bao to leak the so-called "bottom line" of the "Ding and Chen incident," and then, after Pu Xixiu and Yao Fangzao from Wenhui Bao arrived, she deliberately said, "You go ask Shao Quanlin and them about this; their Party group knows." She attempted to use this method to put the Party in a difficult position, forcing the Party to announce the so-called "bottom line of the Ding and Chen incident" to society before people's eyes were opened. Her intentions are extremely vicious!

    丁玲曾经说“自己已经是五十多岁的人了，什么也不想了，只想到桑干河上过一辈子算了。”这是真话吗？不是的。她还有一个更大的阴谋，就是准备在今年10月间举行的第三次全国文代大会上提出所谓“丁陈事件”对党进攻。如果失败，她就声明退出作家协会，妄图在国际上发生不良影响，对党造成不利。
Ding Ling once said, "I am already in my fifties, and I don't want anything anymore. I just want to spend the rest of my life on the Sanggan River." Is this true? No. She has an even bigger conspiracy, which is to raise the so-called "Ding and Chen incident" at the Third National Congress of Literary and Art Workers to attack the Party, which is scheduled to be held in October this year. If it fails, she will declare her withdrawal from the Writers Association, attempting to cause adverse international impact and create disadvantages for the Party.

    丁玲由极端严重的个人主义，发展到反党、反人民、反社会主义不是偶然的，这从她的家庭出身和她的长期的反党的思想实质都可得到证明。
Ding Ling's development from extremely serious individualism to anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist is not accidental. This can be proven from her family background and her long-term anti-Party ideological essence.

      “丁玲出身于封建大地主家庭，她的父亲阔绰到这般程度：他看见人家骑马姿势好看，就派人重金买回许多白马，每匹都给配上白缎绣花马鞍，然后要人们骑着，在他面前奔驰取乐。她的母亲在自己的花园里专门架起一座秋千，来打着消遣。就在这样的家庭里，再加上颓废享受文学的影响，使丁玲的思想里，深深的打上这个阶级的自私、骄傲和绝望的烙印。”在1922年，她加入过无政府主义党，后来凭着小资产阶级狂热参加了革命。1930年参加中国左翼作家联盟，1932年加入中国共产党。1933年被捕自首变节。
"Ding Ling was born into a feudal landlord family. Her father was so wealthy that when he saw someone riding a horse gracefully, he would send people to buy many white horses at great expense, and each horse was equipped with a white satin embroidered saddle, and then he would have people ride them and gallop in front of him for pleasure. Her mother specially built a swing in her garden to pass the time. In such a family, coupled with the influence of decadent and indulgent literature, Ding Ling's mind was deeply branded with the selfishness, pride, and despair of this class." In 1922, she joined an anarchist party, and later participated in the revolution with petty-bourgeois fanaticism. In 1930, she joined the League of Left-Wing Writers, and in 1932, she joined the Chinese Communist Party. In 1933, she was arrested, surrendered, and defected.

    丁玲对敌人是这种态度，对党却是壁垒森严、戒备很深的。1940年她在“我在霞村的时候”一本小说里这样写道：“每个人一定有着某些最不愿告诉人的东西深埋在心中”，这次整风当中她又这样说道：“我得警惕一些，他们（指党）是很会整人的。”就这样，她把叛党的事实，一直欺骗党，不向党交代。她到延安以后，任弼时同志、陈云同志、李富春同志都审查过她的历史，但是她丝毫不作交代，一直隐瞒了七年之久。
Ding Ling has this attitude toward the enemy, but towards the Party she is heavily guarded and fortified. In 1940, she wrote in her novel "When I Was in Xia Village," "Everyone must have something they are most unwilling to tell people buried deep in their hearts." During this rectification campaign, she also said, "I must be vigilant. They (referring to the Party) are very good at attacking people." In this way, she has been deceiving the Party about the fact that she betrayed the Party and has not confessed to the Party. After she arrived in Yan'an, Comrades Ren Bishi, Chen Yun, and Li Fuchun all reviewed her history, but she did not confess in the slightest, and concealed it for seven years.

    丁玲在延安时期，不但没有向党立功赎罪，而且继续干着反党活动。最明显的例子，就是她自己写了“三八节有感”，发表了王实味的“野百合花”，恶毒地向党进行攻击。
During her time in Yan'an, Ding Ling not only did not perform meritorious service for the Party to redeem herself, but also continued to engage in anti-Party activities. The most obvious examples are that she herself wrote "Thoughts on March 8th" and published Wang Shiwei's "Wild Lily," viciously attacking the Party.

    当时，除发表反党文章外，她还和坏分子萧军搞在一起，和党闹对立。萧军因为有丁玲的支持，所以很猖狂，到处咒骂党，为王实味辩护，气焰嚣张，不可一世。
At that time, in addition to publishing anti-Party articles, she also colluded with the bad element Xiao Jun to antagonize the Party. Because Xiao Jun had Ding Ling's support, he was very rampant, cursing the Party everywhere, defending Wang Shiwei, and was arrogant and conceited.

    解放以后，丁玲担任作家协会副主席，文学讲习所所长，先后主编过“文艺报”和“人民文学”，还担任党中央宣传部文艺处处长，可以说，党几乎把文艺方面的领导权都交给了她。但她还说党不信任她，不重视她，专门纠集一批坏分子和党闹对立。
After liberation, Ding Ling served as Vice Chairman of the Writers Association, Director of the Literary Institute, and successively served as Editor-in-Chief of "Wenyi Bao" and "Renmin Wenxue." She also served as Director of the Literary and Art Department of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. It can be said that the Party has almost handed over the leadership of literary and art to her. But she still said that the Party did not trust her, did not value her, and deliberately gathered a group of bad elements to antagonize the Party.

    同志们，对这个阴谋企图，我们不能轻视。他们搞反党集团，秘密组织同人刊物，进一步分裂文艺界，这是我国当前文艺战线上两条路线的斗争，就是无产阶级文艺路线与资产阶级文艺路线的斗争，值得我们注意的是美术界的江丰，也准备在今年10月间要搞一次分裂活动，如果我们把问题联系起来看，我们就不能忽略这个问题的严重意义。这次揭露和粉碎丁陈反党集团是有历史意义的。从左联时代起，三十年来，由于他们这些人反党言行，影响到整个文艺界。这次斗争的中心问题是保卫文学事业的社会主义方向和巩固党的领导的问题，并解决文艺界党内长期存在的一个反党活动的问题。所以我们每个人，都应该分清大是大非，维护党的原则，为建设我们的社会主义社会而奋斗。从这次揭发丁、陈集团来看，在我们无产阶级领导的国家内，一个人如果他要离开共产党，甚而至于反对共产党，那么，不论他是党员也好，非党员也好，一定会碰得鼻肿脸青，头破血流的。这是给我们的一个宝贵的教训，也标志着在党正确的领导下是无往而不胜利的。
Comrades, we must not underestimate this conspiracy. Their anti-Party clique and secret organization of magazines for like-minded people are further splitting the literary and art circles. This is a struggle between two lines on the current literary and art front in our country, namely the struggle between the proletarian literary and art line and the bourgeois literary and art line. It is worth noting that Jiang Feng in the art world is also preparing to engage in a split activity in October this year. If we look at the problem in connection, we cannot ignore the serious significance of this problem. This exposure and crushing of the Ding and Chen Anti-Party Clique is of historical significance. For the past thirty years, since the era of the League of Left-Wing Writers, the anti-Party words and deeds of these people have affected the entire literary and art circles. The central issue of this struggle is to defend the socialist direction of literature and consolidate the Party's leadership, and to solve the problem of long-standing anti-Party activities within the Party in literary and art circles. Therefore, each of us should distinguish between right and wrong, uphold the principles of the Party, and strive to build our socialist society. From this exposure of the Ding and Chen clique, we can see that in our proletarian-led country, if a person wants to leave

　　关于丁玲、陈企霞反党集团的活动
　　中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席许广平在全国妇代会上的发言
    现在我介绍一下丁玲、陈企霞反党集团的问题
　　（一）
    丁玲、陈企霞集团在文艺界进行了一系列的反党活动，他们长期拒绝党的领导和监督。1955年作家协会党组扩大会揭露与批判了丁、陈反党小集团的活动。两年来他们不但没有认识和改正自己的错误，反而继续进行反党活动，并企图在整风中翻案。这个反党集团，是以丁玲为首的文艺界中的一爿黑店。没有丁玲的挂帅，陈企霞的大旗是摇摆不起来的。丁玲住在北京多福巷十六号，围绕着她居住的还有这个集团中的人。有人称多福巷十六号为“裴多菲俱乐部”，从这里经常吹起一股黑风。某人党性强，他们就说“这个人是为做官”；某人靠拢党，他们就说“这人拍马屁”；谁公开骂领导，他们就说“这人有胆量，敢说话”；谁因为条件不够不能入党，他们就说这是“党的关门主义”；甚至有人因为乱搞男女关系而受到党的批评，他们就说“这人家庭生活没有幸福”。
    这个集团的活动方式是十分卑鄙的。他们对人宣传说要讲友情，讲道义，讲诚恳；但是他们对党无情，不讲道义，不讲诚恳。他们讽刺靠拢党的人是“拍马屁，往上爬”，反党的却是“英雄”；在会上公开发言是“卑鄙无耻”，在背后攻击党、骂人，反而是“光荣”；他们进行反党的勾当，说“工作是光荣的”，但别人做些正当的工作，就说这是“往上爬，假积极”。为了达到反党的目的，他们不择手段。从这次揭发出来的材料看，他们利用一些同志对他们的真相不清楚，而冒充好人；利用党在某些工作中的缺点对党进行攻击，却扬言他们是在为真理而斗争；利用有些人对党不满而贩卖他们的所谓同情；利用有些同志的温情主义来找寻对他们的支持；利用同志们在工作中一些正常的不同意见来制造不和；利用有些人对他们的好心爱护而作为进攻党的资本。他们明拉暗扯一些臭味相投的人，鬼鬼祟祟，在一起言不及义——言不及社会主义。这个集团中的一些走卒，为了拉拢别人，使用的手法达到令了人作呕的地步：你要是画家，他就说你画的好；你要是作家，他就说你写的好；你要是青年，他就说你有前途；你要是老年人，他就说你有修养。总之，他们一心一意的利用各种机会进行反党的勾当，企图分裂文艺战线的统一和团结，破坏文学的社会主义方向，阻碍党的方针、政策在文艺界贯彻执行。从地方到北京总有那么一条线，在和党的方针、政策对抗。以前大家不清楚是什么道理，现在才明白原来有丁玲、陈企霞、冯雪峰这个反党集团在作怪。我们必须粉碎这个集团，保卫文学事业的社会主义方向和巩固党的领导。
    （二）
    丁玲是这个集团的头子。我在这里向大家报告一下她的反党言行。
    她是一个名作家，但不是以文艺为武器、为工具来为人民服务，为我们的社会主义建设服务的；而却是提倡“一本书主义”。她主张“一个人有了一本书，便有了一切，谁也打不倒他。”有人没有机会出国，她便挑拨说：“不叫你出国，因为你没有一本书。”谁觉得没有被领导重视，她便说“因为你没有一本书”。她也曾对我说：“你就是做了很多工作，算得了什么呢？写东西才是自己的。”就这样她到处宣传一本书主义，叫人家不要勤勤恳恳接受党交给的任务，好好去工作；却叫人家专为个人的名利进行写作。
    丁玲极端骄傲，目空一切，虚伪、骄横、个人征服一切的反动思想渗透了她。在文学讲习所里，挂她个人的照片，在她家里，她把托尔斯泰的照片和自己的照片并排挂在一起。自封为世界上的伟大作家之一。她自己向人说：在苏联、外国朋友不愿见周扬而愿见她。她曾向别人表示，苏联有一位著名作家拿周立波的“暴风骤雨”和她的“太阳照在桑干河上”这两本小说相提并论很不应该，好像这样就使她受了侮辱，她曾在自己编的文艺报上发表苏联同志讨论她的作品的消息，借以为自己捧场。她对我们党内外作家都看不起。对郭沫若、茅盾、老舍这样的大作家都不尊重，对赵树理同志很看不起。她一再对人说“为什么老把赵树理压在我的头上。”其实，从来也没有任何人把赵树理压在她的头上，倒是她想尽方法来打击赵树理同志。她不但拿文学当个人获取名利的资本，而且拿它来作反党的工具。她在自己负责的如文艺报和文学讲习所里搞独立王国，在这个王国内，不允许任何人批评。在她主编时期的文艺报，经常和“人民文学”唱对台戏，常常借故批评“人民文学”，破坏两个编辑部的团结。1954年，有人匿名写文章攻击赵树理、周立波、刘白羽等，把这一匿名稿同时投给“人民文学”“文艺报”，丁玲知道这个情况后，非常高兴地说，“如果他们（指人民文学）不发表，我们就把它当法宝抛出去”。同是在党领导下的刊物，而丁玲竟恶意的看待它。
    丁玲是一个党员，但在她的思想里却没有组织，没有纪律，公开提倡“骄傲是美德”。她曾向青年人说：“你们骄傲一点不算什么，我年青的时候，比你们还骄傲呢！”她的作品任何人都不能批评，有人曾经写文章批评了她写的“太阳照在桑干河上”，她就无中生有地说这个人是“周扬的高足”，是为了打击她。经过这次揭露证实这个人还是跟他们在一起密谋筹办“同人刊物”的，那里是别人有意组织文章来打击她呢？她骄傲自满，目空一切，发展到了登峰造极的地步。彭真同志略为批评了“太阳照在桑干河上”，她就对彭真同志非常不满，见了彭真同志都不愿打一个招呼。她心目中还有党吗？
    （三）
    前面说过，丁玲在文艺界，培植个人势力，建立独立王国，1955年秋天，作家协会党组举行扩大会议，把丁玲、陈企霞反党集团的盖子给揭开了。但是自从去年，匈牙利事件发生后特别是今年整风以来，他们认为有机可乘，于是又卑鄙的阴谋进行翻案勾当。这个反党集团的成员，到处制造谣言，准备翻案。说什么“丁、陈事情的发生，是由于丁玲写了‘太阳照在桑干河上’得到了斯大林奖金，有了国际声誉，因此别人嫉妒了，才整她的。”企图用攻击个人的方法，达到反党的目的，用淆乱黑白，混淆是非的方法来模糊群众的认识。
    整风开始以后，丁玲有步骤、有计划的先派遣她的党羽在党组会上放炮，然后看到时机成熟，便亲自出马，猖狂地对党进攻。
    她先向到会同志诉苦，她说：“戴了反党小集团的帽子，不敢走出多福巷，不愿参加会议，如人代会、妇代会、学习会等”。这是一种污蔑，是一种歪曲，1955年党虽然对她进行了批评，但并未限制过她的任何活动，相反的倒是对她很照顾，她要到那里就到那里，要见什么人就见什么人。她到过四川、云南等地，许多学校还请她讲演，许多报纸还请她写文章，这怎么能说由于“戴了反党小集团的帽子”就没有自由和地位呢？至于人代会、妇代会、学习会等，是她听信冯雪峰等人的教唆，故意不来参加。难道这不正是表示了她对党的抗拒态度吗？
    丁玲是一个作家，她懂得“被迫害者”这种字眼容易打动人的心弦，容易博得人们的同情。因此，这次她口口声声伪作委屈的诉说她是“贫雇农”，她是失无可失的无产阶级，她是刚从坟墓里爬出来的人，仿佛她既然是“贫雇农”、“无产阶级”、“被迫害者”，那么党就成了“地主”、“资本家”、“迫害者”了。多么恶毒的词句啊！她一再地说：“我是刚刚从坟墓里爬出来的人，能有工作条件就行，个人绝不追究责任。”好像党犯了什么错误，她却宽宏大量不再追究责任了。其实，她的威风却真不小呢？在一次会议上，她问：“党组都是那些人？”人家一一告诉了她以后，她马上转身说：“陈明记上”。她气势汹汹，想要一个一个的来整他们呢，请看，这不是威胁党是什么呢？
    她自己觉得她了不起，搞反党集团有资本，因此，对一位党组负责同志威胁说：“不团结我这个人，把我踢出文艺界，把我搞得很臭，不要紧。但文艺界总要团结，党总要团结的。”仿佛没有她，文艺界就不能团结，党就不能团结，地球也不能按照规律来运动了。
    不是党要把她搞臭，倒是她要想尽方法企图把党攻倒。她组织反党集团，在这个集团中间，她活像一个武则天，有军师、有文臣武将、有打手，又有通讯员和联络员。有自己的“作家”、“理论家”、“诗人”、“杂文作者”……那么一大堆。他们的思想里都有浓厚的阶级异己分子的敌对思想因素。他们专讲个人第一主义，吹吹拍拍，拉拉扯扯，擅长小广播，播送流言蜚语，找各种机会来对党进攻。
    丁玲的反党活动，是打着所谓反对宗派主义的幌子来进行的。她曾经说，她要“通天通地”，所谓“通天”就是指向中央告状，所谓“通地”就是指发动群众。因为照她说来，文艺界的领导同志是“瞒上欺下”的，中央和群众都受了他们的“蒙蔽”了。从这次揭发的材料来看，这完全是一派谎言。有的同志指出，你说中央不了解文艺情况，那么武训传问题、红楼梦研究问题、胡风问题、草木篇和“电影锣鼓”等问题不是中央提出又是谁提出来的呢？而且丁玲口口声声说她只反对个别领导同志，那么她写的“三八节有感”与发表的“野百合花”也只是为了反对这些个别领导同志吗？再说你要发动群众，为什么你们用阴蔽的鬼鬼祟祟的方法来对付党呢？为什么胡风害怕“公家人”，而你共产党员丁玲也害怕自己的所作所为被公务员知道呢？实际上他们反党言行已经公开暴露无遗了，他们的党羽李又然曾对陈企霞说：“我要杀人！”陈企霞说：“我真想放火！”李又然又说：“我现在才体会到打渔杀家中的一句台词‘要杀他的全家，方消我心头之恨’的情绪。”请看，这只是反对个别领导同志吗？
    丁玲不但在党内进行活动，而且勾结文汇报，企图里应外合向党夹攻。她做好圈套，先使她的党羽柳溪到文汇报去泄漏所谓“丁陈事件”的底，然后等文汇报浦熙修和姚芳藻来了以后又故意说“这事你去问邵荃麟他们，他们党组知道。”企图用这办法来对党将一军，迫使党在人们眼睛尚未擦亮以前向社会上宣布所谓“丁陈事件的底”。用心之险可谓毒之极矣！
    丁玲曾经说“自己已经是五十多岁的人了，什么也不想了，只想到桑干河上过一辈子算了。”这是真话吗？不是的。她还有一个更大的阴谋，就是准备在今年10月间举行的第三次全国文代大会上提出所谓“丁陈事件”对党进攻。如果失败，她就声明退出作家协会，妄图在国际上发生不良影响，对党造成不利。
    丁玲由极端严重的个人主义，发展到反党、反人民、反社会主义不是偶然的，这从她的家庭出身和她的长期的反党的思想实质都可得到证明。
      “丁玲出身于封建大地主家庭，她的父亲阔绰到这般程度：他看见人家骑马姿势好看，就派人重金买回许多白马，每匹都给配上白缎绣花马鞍，然后要人们骑着，在他面前奔驰取乐。她的母亲在自己的花园里专门架起一座秋千，来打着消遣。就在这样的家庭里，再加上颓废享受文学的影响，使丁玲的思想里，深深的打上这个阶级的自私、骄傲和绝望的烙印。”在1922年，她加入过无政府主义党，后来凭着小资产阶级狂热参加了革命。1930年参加中国左翼作家联盟，1932年加入中国共产党。1933年被捕自首变节。
    丁玲对敌人是这种态度，对党却是壁垒森严、戒备很深的。1940年她在“我在霞村的时候”一本小说里这样写道：“每个人一定有着某些最不愿告诉人的东西深埋在心中”，这次整风当中她又这样说道：“我得警惕一些，他们（指党）是很会整人的。”就这样，她把叛党的事实，一直欺骗党，不向党交代。她到延安以后，任弼时同志、陈云同志、李富春同志都审查过她的历史，但是她丝毫不作交代，一直隐瞒了七年之久。
    丁玲在延安时期，不但没有向党立功赎罪，而且继续干着反党活动。最明显的例子，就是她自己写了“三八节有感”，发表了王实味的“野百合花”，恶毒地向党进行攻击。
    当时，除发表反党文章外，她还和坏分子萧军搞在一起，和党闹对立。萧军因为有丁玲的支持，所以很猖狂，到处咒骂党，为王实味辩护，气焰嚣张，不可一世。
    解放以后，丁玲担任作家协会副主席，文学讲习所所长，先后主编过“文艺报”和“人民文学”，还担任党中央宣传部文艺处处长，可以说，党几乎把文艺方面的领导权都交给了她。但她还说党不信任她，不重视她，专门纠集一批坏分子和党闹对立。
    同志们，对这个阴谋企图，我们不能轻视。他们搞反党集团，秘密组织同人刊物，进一步分裂文艺界，这是我国当前文艺战线上两条路线的斗争，就是无产阶级文艺路线与资产阶级文艺路线的斗争，值得我们注意的是美术界的江丰，也准备在今年10月间要搞一次分裂活动，如果我们把问题联系起来看，我们就不能忽略这个问题的严重意义。这次揭露和粉碎丁陈反党集团是有历史意义的。从左联时代起，三十年来，由于他们这些人反党言行，影响到整个文艺界。这次斗争的中心问题是保卫文学事业的社会主义方向和巩固党的领导的问题，并解决文艺界党内长期存在的一个反党活动的问题。所以我们每个人，都应该分清大是大非，维护党的原则，为建设我们的社会主义社会而奋斗。从这次揭发丁、陈集团来看，在我们无产阶级领导的国家内，一个人如果他要离开共产党，甚而至于反对共产党，那么，不论他是党员也好，非党员也好，一定会碰得鼻肿脸青，头破血流的。这是给我们的一个宝贵的教训，也标志着在党正确的领导下是无往而不胜利的。
    这一小撮反党的敌人必须彻底交代，向人民低头认罪。
