Not long ago, Yang Shaoqian, a bourgeois rightist at the First Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways, gave his wife a novel called "Corrosion," saying, "Don't be like the female spy in the novel, monitoring and betraying your husband!"

Song Xiuhua, whom Yang Shaoqian regarded as a "female spy," is a budgeter at the First Design Institute and a probationary member of the Communist Party.

Yang Shaoqian usually used his home as a place for carrying out secret activities. Yang Shaoqian often took advantage of Song Xiuhua's absence to hold secret meetings with rightists in his reactionary clique to discuss strategies for carrying out anti-Communist and anti-socialist activities within the design institute. As soon as Song Xiuhua returned, they would immediately change the subject.

After Yang Shaoqian's mother came to Lanzhou from her hometown, Song Xiuhua noticed inconsistencies while chatting about family matters and questioned her closely. It turned out that Yang Shaoqian's family were local tyrants and landlords, and his father was a counter-revolutionary. However, Yang Shaoqian told the leaders of the First Design Institute that he was of middle peasant origin, and he also used this to deceive Song Xiuhua when they got married.

After the employees of the First Design Institute began to fight back against the rightists, Song Xiuhua, in front of Yang Shaoqian, revealed his series of secret activities at home and the truth about him concealing his reactionary family background at a meeting of more than a thousand people in the entire design institute. Her courageous exposure was welcomed and supported by the majority of employees. Song Xiuhua also successively exposed Yang Shaoqian's reactionary remarks slandering the Soviet Union and undermining Sino-Soviet solidarity. Two key members of Yang Shaoqian's secret activity clique were also exposed by Song Xiuhua.

Under the common pursuit and exposure by the employees of this design institute, Yang Shaoqian's fallacies, such as slanderously claiming that the "Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns were like the Shangrao concentration camp" and that "only half of what is in the People's Daily can be believed," as well as his series of crimes of provoking the relationship between the masses and the Communist Party, inciting strikes, attempting to "rehabilitate" counter-revolutionaries, and preparing reactionary "clippings," have now been revealed. It turns out that Yang Shaoqian is a backbone rightist who is determined to take the anti-Communist and anti-socialist road.

Song Xiuhua and Yang Shaoqian have been married for more than a year and already have children. In the test of great storms, she resolutely takes the socialist road and does not allow her husband to take the capitalist road. She publicly warned Yang Shaoqian: "You must make a thorough confession and not try to muddle through; otherwise, you will only cut yourself off from the people!"

    不许丈夫走资本主义道路
     新华社记者　郭汾祥
    不久以前，铁道部第一设计院的资产阶级右派分子杨绍谦送给他妻子一本名叫“腐蚀”的小说，说道：“你不要像小说中的女特务那样，监视和出卖自己的丈夫！”
    被杨绍谦看作“女特务”的宋秀华，是第一设计院的预算员，中共预备党员。
    杨绍谦平日把他的家庭，当作进行不可告人的秘密活动的场所。杨绍谦经常趁宋秀华不在家的时候，跟他的反动小集团里的右派分子开秘密会议，研究在设计院内进行反共反社会主义的策略。宋秀华一回来，他们就立刻东扯西拉，改变话题。
    杨绍谦的母亲从老家到兰州来以后，在同宋秀华闲谈家务的时候，宋秀华发觉话里有破绽，仔细追问。原来杨绍谦的家庭是恶霸地主，他的父亲是反革命分子。然而，杨绍谦对第一设计院的领导上却说他是中农出身，在他俩结婚的时候，他也是这样来欺骗宋秀华的。
    第一设计院职工开始反击右派分子以后，宋秀华就在全设计院一千多人的大会上，面对着杨绍谦，揭露了他在家里的一连串秘密活动和他隐瞒反动家庭的真相。她的勇敢的揭露，受到广大职工的欢迎和支持。宋秀华还先后揭露了杨绍谦诬蔑苏联、破坏中苏团结等反动言论。杨绍谦进行秘密活动的小集团的两个骨干分子，也被宋秀华揭露出来。
    在这个设计院职工共同追击和揭露下，杨绍谦诬蔑“三反、肃反是上饶集中营”、“人民日报只能相信一半”等等谬论，和他挑拨群众和共产党的关系、煽动罢工、企图为反革命分子“平反”、筹办反动“剪报”等等一连串反共反苏反社会主义的罪行，现在都已经真相大白，原来杨绍谦是一个坚决走反共反社会主义道路的右派骨干分子。
    宋秀华和杨绍谦结婚一年多，已经有了小孩。在大风大浪的考验里，她坚决走社会主义道路，也不允许丈夫走资本主义道路。她公开警告杨绍谦：“必须彻底交代，不许蒙混过关，否则只有自绝于人民！”
