Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 26th: In more than sixty factories in Shenyang that have entered a high tide of airing views and contending, big-character posters have become the most active form for workers to help the Party in its rectification campaign. The big-character posters put up by the workers contain straightforward criticisms of the leadership, with the vast majority focusing on improving production management and improving the work style of cadres. Wen Youli, a milling machine operator at the Mining Machinery Factory, wrote a quick-rhythm verse criticizing the phenomenon of a milling machine leaking thirty-six jin of oil every day, wasting fifty-seven yuan, with no one taking care of it. Ma Shilong, an old worker at the Air Compressor Factory, wrote a big-character poster titled "The Technology Section Has a Careless Person," criticizing the section for not carefully reviewing blueprints, which resulted in defective products during the processing of parts in the workshop.

The enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers in various factories in Shenyang to help the Party rectify is extremely high. Workers at the HuangguTtun Locomotive Repair Factory posted more than 3,500 big-character posters in three days; after sorting them out, there were more than 4,000 opinions. Dozens of "writing services" at the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory and the Air Compressor Factory are crowded with people requesting assistance in writing big-character posters during break times.

Leaders of various factories in Shenyang attach great importance to absorbing the opinions from the big-character posters to improve their work. For example, Workshop 513 of the Shenyang Chemical Factory issued one hundred new sets of work clothes this year but did not issue safety helmets. The day after the workers posted a big-character poster, the workshop issued safety helmets. The Mining Machinery Factory has already repaired the milling machine that was leaking thirty-six jin of oil a day.

    帮助党整风最活跃的形式
    沈阳工厂职工充分利用大字报
    据新华社沈阳26日电　沈阳六十多个进入鸣放高潮的工厂，大字报已成为职工帮助党整风的最活跃的形式。职工们贴出的大字报对领导提出了率直的批评，内容绝大部分是从改进生产管理，改进干部作风出发。矿山机器厂铣工闻有礼，编写快板批评了一台铣床每天漏油三十六斤，浪费五十七元而没人管的现象。空气压缩机厂老工人马士龙，写了一张“工艺科有马大哈”的大字报，批评科里审查图纸不严，使车间在加工部件时出了废品。
    各工厂广大职工帮助党整风的热情极其高涨。皇姑屯机车修理厂的职工，在三天中张贴出的大字报有三千五百多张，经整理后，就有四千多条意见。沈阳矿山机器厂和空气压缩机厂的几十个“代笔处”，一到休息时间就拥满要求代写大字报的人群。
    沈阳各工厂领导非常重视吸取大字报的意见来改进工作。如沈阳化工厂五一三车间，今年新发了一百套工作服，没发安全帽，工人贴出大字报的第二天，车间就发给安全帽。矿山机器厂对那台一天漏油三十六斤的铣床已作了检修。
