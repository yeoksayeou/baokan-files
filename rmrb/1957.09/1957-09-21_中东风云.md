Middle East Situation

Syria Sends Note to Jordan Levying Accusations
    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, September 20th: The Syrian government published on the evening of September 19th a note it recently sent to the Jordanian government. This note accuses the Jordanian government of actually expressing its so-called "unease" about Syria to a "foreign country that harbors no good intentions towards the Arabs." The "foreign country" mentioned here refers to the United States.

    The Syrian note stated: "Due to the brotherly relations between the two countries [Syria and Jordan], any one of them should communicate its unease to the related brotherly country, rather than to a foreign country that in any case harbors no good intentions towards the Arabs."

    News from Amman stated that the Jordanian government issued its reply note to the Syrian government on the same day. This reply note denies that the Jordanian government ever "provided any reason" to Henderson that would lead him to express conclusions of "unease." The reply note also rebukes the Syrian government for adopting an "unfriendly attitude" towards Jordan and "interfering in Jordan's internal affairs."

    According to reports, the U.S. Sixth Fleet began new activities in the eastern Mediterranean two days ago. Lebanese troops began exercises on the 19th, and Turkey has increased the number of troops concentrated on the Syrian border.

Saudi Arabia Reaffirms Support for Syria
    Xinhua News Agency, September 20th: Mecca dispatch: Mecca Radio said on September 19th that if Syria "is subjected to any aggression," the "desire and policy" of Saudi Arabian King Saud is to defend Syria.

    The official Saudi Arabian radio station stated: "We all know about the recent clamorous propaganda campaign against our sister country, Syria. We also know that he (King Saud) is prepared to defend Syria if Syria is subjected to any aggression. He has concluded treaties and alliances with Syria and has consistently demonstrated that he respects the obligations and responsibilities he has undertaken."
