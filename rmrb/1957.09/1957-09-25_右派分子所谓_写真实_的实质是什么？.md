    What is the essence of the so-called "writing the truth" by right-wingers?
    The so-called "writing the truth" also belongs to this evil "theoretical" system. Therefore, let us start with this "writing the truth." The saying "writing the truth" is not new; it is synonymous with naturalism and objectivism. The truth that socialist realism advocates—to reflect reality truthfully, historically, and concretely in the revolutionary development of reality—is not the same as what some writers here advocate today as "writing the truth." The artistic truth that socialist realism requires is the essence of life. But since those who advocate "writing the truth" here do not clearly define the meaning of truth in their minds, we must ask: What kind of truth to write? Why write it? Here, the first question, "What kind of truth to write," is a question of viewpoint; the second question, "Why write it," is a question of standpoint. If the viewpoint is Marxist-Leninist and the standpoint is that of the working class, then this is socialist realism, so why bother mentioning "writing the truth" again? In fact, those who advocate "writing the truth" believe that socialist realism is wrong, or at least unnecessary. In fact, their so-called "writing the truth" is to write about the dark side of life. Socialist realism opposes glossing over reality and advocates exposing contradictions, but it also opposes obliterating the essence of life; obliterating the essence of life is distorting reality. So, what is the essence of our life today, dark or bright? We are engaged in socialist construction, and we have already achieved great achievements in just a few years. This bright scene is the essence of our life. The bourgeois right-wingers, who oppose socialism and hate socialism, slanderously clamor about "utter darkness." Obviously, "writing the truth" is in line with the tastes of the right-wingers. Recent disclosures have also shown that some right-wingers, under the guise of "writing the truth," viciously attack the Party, attack the proletariat, and slander our forward-developing socialist construction cause.

### 右派分子所谓“写真实”的实质是什么？

专栏：报刊论文摘要

    右派分子所谓“写真实”的实质是什么？
    所谓“写真实”，也是属于这个邪恶的“理论”体系的。因此，让我们先从这个“写真实”谈起。“写真实”云云，也不是新东西；它就是自然主义，客观主义的同义语。社会主义现实主义所主张的真实地、历史地和具体地在现实的革命发展中反映现实，和今天我们这里有些作家所主张的“写真实”是并无相同之处的。社会主义现实主义所要求的艺术的真实，就是生活中本质的东西。可是我们这里的“写真实”的主张者既然并不明确他们的心目中的真实的涵义，我们就一定要问道：写什么样的真实？为什么要写？这里，第一句，“写什么样的真实”，是观点的问题；第二句，“为什么要写”，是立场的问题。如果观点是马列主义的，立场是工人阶级的，那么，这就是社会主义现实主义了，何必再另提什么“写真实”？事实上，主张“写真实”的人，认为社会主义现实主义是不对的，至少是不必要的。事实上，他们的所谓“写真实”，就是要写生活的阴暗面。社会主义现实主义反对粉饰现实，主张暴露矛盾，但也反对抹煞生活中本质的东西；抹煞生活中本质的东西即是歪曲现实。那么，今天我们生活中本质的东西到底是阴暗的还是光明的？我们在进行社会主义建设，我们在短短的几年内已经取得了巨大的成就。这一片光明景象，就是我们生活中本质的东西。反对社会主义，仇视社会主义的资产阶级右派这才诬蔑地叫嚣着什么“一团漆黑”。显而易见，“写真实”云云，和右派分子的口味正相吻合。最近揭露的事实，正也表明了一些右派分子在“写真实”的幌子下恶毒地进攻党，进攻无产阶级，诬蔑我们的向前发展的社会主义建设事业。（摘自1957年9月号“文艺学习”茅盾：“公式化、概念化如何避免”）
