    Poetry Handbill
    Confusion
    Zhang Zhimin
    At the meeting he said—
    I hope everyone can point out,
    How should my problem be discussed?
    I'm getting on in years,
    And my mind is a bit "confused."
    After the meeting he thought—
    The materials they have,
    Seem to be less than half,
    Those seventh, eighth, and ninth plans,
    Conceal them if I can.
    Emotion Zhang Zhimin
    He confesses—
    Those remarks,
    Were all "impulsive"
    I am a "red-faced fellow,"
    My brain is too hot,
    And I love to act on "emotion."
    People say—
    Your "explanation"
    Should be corrected as follows:
    I am a white-faced fellow,
    Very enthusiastic about counter-revolution,
    But have no feelings for the people.
    Woodworm
      Xia Zi'an
    Woodworm, buzzing,
    Mouth only knows how to drill holes.
    How many good doors and windows are eaten away,
    How many new houses are riddled.
    Stamp it out, all act,
    Destroy the nest and wipe out the species;
    Rightist elements do not repent,
    Their fate is like the woodworm.

    诗传单
    乱
    张志民
    会上他说——
    希望大家能点一点，
    我的问题该怎么谈？
    上了几岁年纪
    头脑实在有点儿“乱”
    会后他想——
    他们掌握的材料，
    看来还不到一半，
    那第七、八、九方案，
    能瞒还是瞒。
    感情  张志民
    他检讨——
    那些个言论，
    都是一时“冲动”
    我是个“红脸汉子”
    脑瓜子好热，
    遇事最爱动“感情”
    人们说——
    你的“说明”
    该作如下更正：
    我是个白脸汉子，
    对反革命十分热，
    对人民实在没感情。
    蛀木虫
      夏自安
    蛀木虫，嗡嗡嗡，
    嘴巴长的光打洞。
    咬坏几多好门窗，
    蛀烂新屋多少栋。
    扑灭它，齐动手，
    捣毁巢穴灭尽种；
    右派分子不悔改
    命运就像蛀木虫。
