Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: American children will begin their new school year with an extreme shortage of classrooms, and many students will have to attend classes in places such as coal storage sheds, warehouses, abandoned freight cars, and buses. Many facts published in American newspapers prove this situation.

Not long ago, the U.S. "National Education Association" issued a statement saying that the United States lacks more than 159,000 classrooms this year, and 79,000 dilapidated and unusable school buildings are in urgent need of replacement. According to the AFL-CIO News Service, in Kentucky, "many school buildings have been in use for almost a hundred years," their "corridors are dark, and the toilets are located on the street." Even in major industrial and cultural centers like New York, the lack of classrooms is very serious. For example, a school on Grove Street was built two hundred years ago and has not been substantially repaired once since. According to newspaper statistics, the schools on Fourth Street and Twelfth Street in New York each accommodate twice as many students as these school buildings can hold. Even the Mayor of New York once admitted after visiting such a school that it was "a disgrace to New York City."

American newspapers, in analyzing the reasons for this situation, pointed out that the municipal authorities are unwilling to allocate even the most basic funds for repairing school buildings, and proposals for appropriating funds for building schools are engaged in bureaucratic red tape year after year in various U.S. federal agencies and congressional committees.

    美国校舍又缺又破
    许多儿童将在草棚仓库车厢上课
    据新华社31日讯  美国儿童将在教室极其缺乏的情况下开始他们的新学年，许多学生将不得不在堆煤的草棚下、仓库里、荒弃的货车车厢和公共汽车等地方上课。美国报刊发表的许多事实证明了这种情况。
    前不久，美国“全国教育协会”发表声明说，美国今年缺少教室十五万九千多间，有七万九千间破旧不堪、已不适合使用的校舍急待更换。据劳联—产联新闻处宣布，在肯塔基州“许多校舍已差不多使用了一百年”，它们的“走廊暗黑无光，而厕所则设在街上”。甚至在纽约这样的大工业文化中心，教室缺乏现象也十分严重。例如格罗夫街有一所学校是二百年前建立的，至今未大修过一次。据报刊统计，纽约第四号街和第十二号街各个学校容纳的学生人数要比这些校舍所能容纳的数量多一倍。甚至纽约市长有一次在参观一所这样的学校后也不得不承认，这是“纽约市的耻辱”。
    美国报刊在分析产生这种情况的原因时指出，市政当局不肯拨付最起码的经费供修缮校舍之用，关于拨款建设学校的提案则年复一年地在美国各联邦机构和国会各委员会从事公文旅行。
