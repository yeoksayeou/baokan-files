Seeking More Methods to Treat Schistosomiasis
Scientists Gather to Discuss Clinical and Drug Research

(Our report) From August 26th to 30th, the Clinical and Drug Groups of the Medical Science Research Committee and the Schistosomiasis Research Committee of the Central Ministry of Health held a meeting in Hangzhou.

More than 100 people attended the meeting, including负责人 from the Schistosomiasis Control Nine-Person Leading Group Office of the CPC Central Committee, the Central Ministry of Health, and the Schistosomiasis Scientific Research Committees from more than ten provinces and cities including Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Fujian, Anhui, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Yunnan, and Shanghai, as well as experts and professors engaged in clinical and drug research on schistosomiasis, and observers.

The meeting reviewed and summarized the achievements of clinical and drug research on schistosomiasis in the first half of this year, discussed the key points of clinical and drug research in the second half of this year, and how to comprehensively complete this year's research plan. A preliminary discussion was also held on the five-year plan for national schistosomiasis research work from 1958 to 1962. Combining the actual needs of the current prevention and control work, a research plan outline for the clinical and drug groups in 1958 was preliminarily determined.

During this meeting, more than 160 papers on clinical and drug research on schistosomiasis were received. At the meeting, scientists extensively exchanged experiences gained in clinical treatment and drug experiments in various regions. They focused on discussing simple and easy-to-implement short-course antimony therapy and oral antimony therapy that are suitable for the vast rural areas' production and economic conditions and easily mastered by primary doctors. In addition to continuing to affirm the efficacy of the three-day antimony therapy and its safety, which is suitable for promotion in rural areas, it was also proven that the seven-day antimony therapy, although with greater reactions, had better treatment effects in both clinical and drug trials than the three-day therapy. It was decided to select areas for key trials. The meeting believed that oral antimony therapy is simple and easy to implement and has a certain curative effect, and comparative research can be continued. Based on reports from various papers, the meeting also requested that various regions continue to study changing the dosage form of antimony agents, reducing the toxicity of antimony agents, and conducting further clinical research and observation. At the same time, it was also requested that traditional Chinese medicines for treating patients with advanced stages of the disease, such as *Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides* and *Lobelia chinensis*, should also continue to be studied in order to achieve greater therapeutic effects.

    为治疗血吸虫病寻求更多的方法
    科学家们集会讨论临床和药物研究工作
    本报讯　8月26日至30日，中央卫生部医学科学研究委员会和血吸虫病研究委员会临床、药物两组在杭州举行会议。
    出席这次会议的有中共中央防治血吸虫病九人小组办公室、中央卫生部，以及来自浙江、江苏、江西、福建、安徽、广东、广西、湖北、湖南、云南和上海等十多个省市的血吸虫病科学研究委员会的负责人和从事血吸虫病临床和药物研究工作的专家、教授和列席人员，共一百多人。
    会议检查和总结了今年上半年血吸虫病临床和药物研究工作的成果，讨论了今年下半年临床和药物研究工作的重点以及如何全面地完成今年研究计划的问题，对1958年至1962年全国血吸虫病研究工作的五年规划也进行了初步讨论，并结合当前防治工作的实际需要，初步确定了1958年临床和药物两组的研究计划大纲。
    这次会议中，共收到有关研究血吸虫病临床和药物方面的论文一百六十多篇。在会上，科学家们广泛地交流了各地在临床治疗和药物实验方面所取得的经验，并着重地讨论了适宜于广大农村的生产和经济条件，容易为初级医生掌握的简便易行的锑剂短程疗法和锑剂口服疗法。除继续肯定锑剂三日疗法的疗效和它的安全，适宜于农村推广外；并证明锑剂七日疗法，虽然反应较大，但在临床和药物的试验方面，治疗效果都高于三日疗法，决定选择地区重点试行。会议认为锑剂口服疗法简便易行，也有一定的疗效，可以继续进行比较研究。会上还根据各方面的论文报告，要求各地继续研究改变锑剂剂型、减轻锑剂的毒性，在临床上作进一步的研究和观察。同时还要求对治疗晚期病人的中药如腹水草和半边莲等也应继续进行研究，以便在治疗上收到更大的效果。
