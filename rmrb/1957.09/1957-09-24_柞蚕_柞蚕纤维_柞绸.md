Small Facts:

    China's tussah silkworm breeding areas are mainly distributed in sixteen provinces, including Liaoning, Shandong, Henan, Guizhou, Jilin, Sichuan, Gansu, and Hubei, encompassing more than 120 counties. Tussah silk has been exported to dozens of countries, including the Soviet Union, East Germany, India, and Burma. The annual export value of silk from the Liaoning Provincial Tussah Silk Company is equivalent to 250,000 taels of gold.

    Tussah silkworm cocoons have a wide range of uses. Long fibers can be reeled into silk and woven into silk fabrics, while short fibers can be woven into spun silk. Tussah silk fiber has natural properties of being strong, acid-resistant, alkali-resistant, and insulating. Tussah silk can be used to make clothing, as well as insulation materials and filter materials for the electrical and chemical industries. Silkworm pupae can be pressed for oil and used to make monosodium glutamate (MSG). Pupae residue is also an excellent fertilizer. If all the silkworm pupae in the country were pressed for oil, 1.8 million tons of fertilizer could be produced annually, enough to fertilize 600,000 mu of land.

    Raising tussah silkworms does not compete with grain and cotton for land, nor does it interfere with farming schedules. A laborer can earn 120 yuan in three months by raising tussah silkworms during agricultural off-seasons, which is more than the income from growing cotton or apples.

    China currently has 70 million mu of tussah forests. If fully utilized, it could produce 38,710 tons of long and short fibers annually.

    柞蚕·柞蚕纤维·柞绸
    我国的柞蚕饲养区，主要分布在辽宁、山东、河南、贵州、吉林、四川、甘肃、湖北等十六个省，一百二十多个县。柞蚕丝绸已经远销到苏联、民主德国、印度、缅甸等几十个国家。辽宁省柞蚕丝绸公司每年出口的丝绸，价值二十五万两黄金。
    柞蚕茧的利用范围很广，长纤维可以缫丝、织绸，短纤维可以织娟绸。柞蚕纤维具有坚牢、耐酸、耐碱和绝缘的天然特性。柞绸可以做衣服，可以做电气工业、化学工业的绝缘材料和过滤器材。蚕蛹可以榨油，也可做味素。蛹粕又是最好的肥料。把全国的蚕蛹榨成油以后，一年可以生产一百八十万吨肥料，可施肥六十万亩田地。
    养柞蚕不会同粮、棉争土地，又不误农时。一个劳动力利用农闲养柞蚕，在三个月内，可以得到一百二十元的收入，比种植棉花、苹果的收入还多。
    我国现有七千万亩柞林，如全部加以利用，每年就可生产长短纤维三万八千七百一十吨。
