Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 14th: The Prime Minister's Office of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam today issued a communiqué regarding the visit of Indian Vice President Radhakrishnan to Vietnam.

The communiqué stated that during his visit to Vietnam at the invitation of the Vietnamese government, Indian Vice President Radhakrishnan met with President Ho Chi Minh and held talks with Prime Minister Pham Van Dong and other members of the Vietnamese government. Through these talks:

	1. Both parties believe that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence proposed by Prime Ministers Nehru and Zhou Enlai, which have been endorsed and implemented by many countries around the world, should be strictly respected as the foundation for cooperative relations between countries. All international disputes should be resolved through peaceful negotiation.

	2. Both parties agree that active efforts should be made to prohibit all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons. The world's major powers should use atomic energy for peaceful purposes to serve humanity.

	3. Both parties are pleased to see the growing strength of national liberation movements in Asian and African countries. Some Asian and African countries have already achieved freedom. Both parties believe that any form of colonialism brings suffering to humanity and must therefore be completely eliminated. Both parties hope that the spirit of the Bandung Conference can continue to develop. The policies of both countries are to not participate in any military blocs and to contribute to the effort to realize the principles of the Bandung Conference.

	4. Both parties believe that the United Nations must be an organization that all countries can participate in. The People's Republic of China must be a member state of the United Nations.

	5. Both parties believe that Goa is an integral part of Indian territory. The Indian government is conducting a peaceful struggle to incorporate Goa into Indian territory. Vietnam is a country with the same language and the same ethnicity and must be unified peacefully and democratically in accordance with the Geneva Accords.

	6. Both parties are satisfied that the relations between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of India have developed well. Both parties agree that efforts should be made to strengthen existing friendly relations for the benefit of both peoples.

	7. On behalf of the Vietnamese people, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong expressed his gratitude to the Government of the Republic of India for its activities in restoring peace in Indochina based on the principle of respecting the sovereignty of the countries of Indochina, and for the efforts made by the International Supervisory and Control Commission, chaired by India, in implementing the Vietnam Armistice Agreement.

	8. Both parties believe that the friendly visits of leaders of the two governments will strengthen understanding and relations between the two countries and contribute to the consolidation of peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

Radhakrishnan Says at Vietnamese National Assembly that the United Nations Has Serious Shortcomings

This newspaper provides comprehensive reports: According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi: Prime Minister Pham Van Dong held a grand banquet at the International Club on the evening of the 13th to entertain Indian Vice President Radhakrishnan. Vietnamese Deputy Prime Ministers Phan Ke Toai and Vo Nguyen Giap, ministers of the government, leaders of the National Assembly, the Fatherland Front, and various political parties, as well as diplomatic envoys and the chairmen of international committees, were invited to attend the reception. In their speeches, both hosts and guests expressed their hope that the friendship between the two countries would continue to develop and that economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries would be further strengthened.

On the 14th, Indian Vice President Radhakrishnan delivered a speech at the seventh session of the Vietnamese National Assembly, advocating that realistic, peaceful, democratic, and mutually accommodating methods should be used to resolve the current major problems of the world. Radhakrishnan said: The United Nations is an organization established to resolve international disputes peacefully and with mutual concessions, but the United Nations currently has very serious shortcomings and has not yet truly become an institution for resolving international disputes by peaceful means.

Radhakrishnan said that first, the United Nations does not include all countries in the world, such as China and Vietnam. He said that because China does not have a representative participating in the United Nations, important international conferences such as the Geneva Conference have to be held outside the United Nations, which reduces the credibility and value of the United Nations.

Second, the United Nations often does not deal with the substance of the problems when resolving international issues, but proceeds according to the Cold War approach. When the United Nations addresses issues such as Vietnam, Korea, Algeria, and Syria, it does not do so from the perspective of the people of these countries, but from the perspective of the great powers. He said that the United Nations organization was originally supposed to be an organization representing international rights and a force for safeguarding them, but it has become a tool of these great powers. He reminded these great powers that they must see clearly the fact that the world situation is changing.

He said: We have entered an era with a great future, but this era may be damaged by the miscalculations of some great powers. There should be no psychological preparation for waging war, and atomic energy should be used for peaceful purposes.

He said that some neighborly countries have already emerged. He hopes that close cooperation between Vietnam and India will bring a bright future to mankind.

After a three-day visit to Vietnam, Radhakrishnan flew to Vientiane on the afternoon of the 14th.

　　河内发表印度副总统访越公报
　　越印主张和平协商国际争端
　　两国认为必须彻底排除任何形式的殖民主义
    新华社河内14日电  越南民主共和国总理府今天下午发表关于印度副总统拉达克里希南访问越南的公报。
    公报说，印度副总统拉达克里希南应邀访问越南期间，曾经拜会了胡志明主席，并且同范文同总理和越南政府的其他人员进行了会谈。通过这些会谈：
    一、双方认为，尼赫鲁总理和周恩来总理提出的已经得到世界许多国家赞成和运用的和平五项原则，应该得到严格的尊重，以作为各国间合作关系的基础。一切国际争端应该用和平协商的方法来解决。
    二、双方同意，应该为要求禁止各种原子武器和氢武器进行积极的斗争。世界各强国应该把原子能用于和平的目的上来为人类服务。
    三、双方满意地看到亚非各国的民族解放运动日益强大。一些亚非国家已经取得了自由。双方认为，任何形式的殖民主义，都给人类带来痛苦，因此，必须彻底加以排除。双方希望万隆会议的精神能够永远得到发展。两国的政策是不参加任何军事集团，并为努力实现万隆会议的原则作出贡献。
    四、双方认为，联合国必须是各国都能够参加的一个组织。中华人民共和国必须是联合国的会员国。
    五、双方认为，果阿是印度领土不可分割的一部分。印度政府正在以和平方式进行斗争，以便把果阿并入印度领土。越南是一个同一语言、同一种族的国家，必须根据日内瓦协议，以和平和民主的方式统一起来。
    六、双方满意地认为，越南民主共和国和印度共和国之间的关系已经得到良好的发展。双方同意，为了两国人民利益，应该努力加强现有的友谊关系。
    七、对印度共和国政府在尊重印度支那各国主权的原则上恢复印度支那和平的活动，对以印度为主席的国际监督和监察委员会在越南停战协定的履行上所作的努力，范文同总理代表越南人民表示谢意。
    八、双方认为，两国政府领导人的友谊访问，将加强两国之间的了解和关系，并且对东南亚和世界和平的巩固作出贡献。拉达克里希南在越南国会上说联合国目前存在着严重缺点
    本报综合报道  据新华社河内电：范文同总理13日晚上在国际俱乐部举行盛大宴会，招待印度副总统拉达克里希南。越南副总理潘继遂、武元甲，政府各部部长，国会、祖国战线和各党派的负责人以及外交使节、国际委员会主席等都应邀出席了招待会。宾主在讲话中，都表示希望两国的友谊日益发展、两国经济和文化方面的合作日益加强。
    14日，印度副总统拉达克里希南在越南国会第七次会议上发表演说，主张要用现实的、和平、民主、互让的方法来解决当前世界的各种重大问题。拉达克里希南说：联合国是为了用和平、互让的方式来解决各种国际争端而成立的组织，但是目前联合国存在着很严重的缺点，还没有真正成为一个用和平方法来解决国际争端的机构。
    拉达克里希南说，首先，联合国没有包括世界上的所有国家，如像中国和越南。他说，由于中国没有代表参加联合国，所以，像日内瓦会议这样重要的国际性会议，要在联合国以外来举行，这就减低了联合国的威信和价值。
    其次，联合国在解决国际问题的时候，常常不是根据问题的实质，而是根据冷战的方式去进行。联合国在解决越南、朝鲜、阿尔及利亚、叙利亚等问题的时候，不是根据这些国家人民的观点，而是站在强国的观点上来解决。他说，联合国组织本来应该是代表国际权利和警卫力量的一个组织，可是它已经变成了这些强国的工具。他提醒这些强国必须看清楚世界局势正在改变的这一事实。
    他说：我们已经进入一个有着伟大将来的时代，但是这时代可能因为一些强国的错误打算而遭损害。不应当为进行战争作心理准备，原子能应该用在和平的目的上。
    他说，目前已经出现一些睦邻国家。他希望越南同印度密切的合作，为人类带来美好前景。
    拉达克里希南在越南进行了三天的访问之后，14日下午坐飞机前往万象。
