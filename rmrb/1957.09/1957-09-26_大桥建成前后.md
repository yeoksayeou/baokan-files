The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge connects the Jinghan (Beijing-Hankou) and Yuehan (Guangzhou-Hankou) Railways, and connects the three towns of Wuhan.

Before the opening of the Yangtze River Bridge, north-south transportation here relied on four means of transport: 1. Train ferry; 2. Automobile ferry; 3. Barges; 4. Passenger ferries.

Although the Wuhan train ferry has increased from one in the early days of liberation to the current four, and can transport more than 1,000 freight cars back and forth every day, it still falls far short of demand. Freight owners' plans to ship goods across the river are often greatly reduced. At the same time, it takes at least five hours for a train to cross the river by boat, which is equivalent to the transportation cost of one hundred kilometers. After the Yangtze River Bridge is opened to traffic, the amount of goods crossing the river will no longer be subject to such restrictions; it will only take two and a half to three hours for a train to travel from Hankou Jiang'an Station to Wuchang South Station, including the time for assembling the vehicles, which only requires a transportation cost of 21.7 kilometers.

The city only has one car ferry, which can carry twelve cars at a time and can transport up to 300 cars back and forth a day. When there are many cars, it often takes three or four hours to cross the river. In the future, crossing the river via the Yangtze River Bridge will only take about half an hour per trip.

Intra-city material allocation mainly relies on barges to cross the river. To transport a load of goods by barge, the goods have to be unloaded from the train, loaded onto a car, then unloaded from the car and loaded onto the boat. After the boat crosses the river, the goods have to be unloaded from the boat and loaded onto the car, then unloaded from the car into the warehouse, a total of five processes. It takes a barge one to one and a half days to transport a load of goods between Hankou and Wuchang. Especially for the construction of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO), the yellow sand transported by train from the north alone amounts to two or three thousand tons at a time. Every time the sand is unloaded in Hankou to cross the river, it is necessary to temporarily increase thousands of stevedores. In this aspect alone, WISCO spent nine thousand yuan in one month. After the bridge opens to traffic, trains will be able to go directly to the WISCO construction site.

The above refers to situations when the weather is normal. When there are gales of magnitude six or higher on the river or heavy fog, all ferries have to stop, and north-south traffic is cut off. In winter, the river water is shallow, the channel narrows, and it is difficult for heavy-duty ferries to dock. The train ferry also has to reduce its carrying capacity by 30% to 40% compared to normal water levels. After the Yangtze River Bridge is opened to traffic, north-south traffic will be unimpeded regardless of heavy fog, heavy rain, strong winds, huge waves, floods or dry water!

In the past, passengers traveling north and south had to rush to cross the river to catch the next train as soon as they got off the train. If they were slightly late and missed a ferry, they would have to wait forty minutes, and sometimes they would miss the train. It is naturally even more inconvenient for passengers carrying large amounts of luggage and children. It takes at least two hours to get on and off a train and cross the river. After the Yangtze River Bridge is opened to traffic, there are direct trains from Beijing to Guangzhou and Beijing to Nanning every day, and passengers can reduce countless troubles. It only takes forty-five minutes for passenger trains to cross the river via the bridge, including the time for stopping at Wuchang and Hankou stations. (Attached pictures)

    大桥建成前后
    本报记者　张碨
    武汉长江大桥把京汉和粤汉铁路连接起来了，把武汉三镇连接起来了。
    在长江大桥通车以前，这里的南北交通只能靠四种交通工具：一、火车轮渡；二、汽车轮渡；三、驳船；四、渡江客轮。
    武汉的火车轮渡，虽然已经从解放初期的一艘增加到现在的四艘，每天能来回运送一千多辆货车，但是还远远不能满足需要。货主提出运货过江的计划，经常都要大大削减。同时，火车乘船过一次江，最快需要五小时，需要相当于一百公里的运输费用。长江大桥通车以后，货物渡江的数量就不再受这样的限制；火车从汉口江岸车站到武昌南站，连编组车辆的时间在内，也只需要二小时半至三小时，只需要二十一点七公里的运输费用。
    汽车渡船全市只有一艘，一趟可装十二辆汽车，一天最多只能来回装运三百多辆。汽车多的时候，往往要等三、四小时才能过江。以后由长江大桥过江，每趟车只要半小时左右。
    市内物资调拨主要靠驳船过江。驳船运一趟货，得将货物卸下火车，装上汽车，再下车装船，船过江后又得下船上汽车，下车进仓，共需五道工序。一条驳船需要一天到一天半的时间，才能在汉口和武昌之间运一趟货。特别像武钢的建设，仅它从北方用火车运来的黄沙，一次就是两三万吨，在汉口下车过江，每次都得临时增加上千的装卸工人。仅是这一方面的费用，武钢有一个月就花了九千来元。大桥通车以后，火车便能直接开到武钢工地了。
    上面谈的还是天气正常时的情况。当江上刮起六级以上的大风或者大雾弥漫的时候，一切轮渡都得停航，南北交通便断绝了。冬季江水枯浅，航道变窄，载重渡船停靠困难，火车渡船也要比正常水位减少载运量30％到40％。长江大桥通车以后，无论大雾大雨，狂风巨浪，或者洪水枯水，南北交通都能畅通无阻了！
    过去，南北过往旅客一下火车就得急急忙忙赶过江去换下一趟火车，稍迟一会，误了一班轮渡，就得等四十分钟，有时还会将火车误了。携带大批行李和携儿带女的旅客，自然更加不便。这样上下一次车和过一次江，起码得花两小时以上的时间。长江大桥通车以后，每天北京到广州和北京到南宁都有直达列车，旅客们可以减去无数的麻烦。客运火车经大桥过江，包括在武昌、汉口车站停车的时间在内，只要四十五分钟就足够了。（附图片）
