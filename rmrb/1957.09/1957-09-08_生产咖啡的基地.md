    Base for Coffee Production

    The Dehong, Simao, and Lincang Special Zones of Yunnan Province will become bases for coffee production in the future.

    Farmers in the Dehong and other regions of Yunnan Province have traditionally cultivated coffee. According to investigations, there are approximately 30,000 old coffee trees in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, producing about 5,000 jin of coffee beans annually. In recent years, under the promotion of the local Party and government, many places have begun nursery cultivation and large-scale planting. For example, about 24,000 mu have been planted in Dehong, Simao, Lincang, and other places.

    Yunnan Province's coffee planting plan has been initially determined. During the Second Five-Year Plan, 300,000 mu of coffee will be planted in Dehong, Simao, Lincang, and other places.

    生产咖啡的基地
    云南省德宏、思茅、临沧等专区，今后将成为生产咖啡的基地。
    云南省德宏等地区的农民历来就有种植咖啡的习惯，据调查，在德宏傣族景颇族自治州就有咖啡老树三万株左右，每年生产咖啡豆约五千斤。近年来由于在当地党和政府的提倡下，许多地方已有育苗成片种植的，如德宏、思茅、临沧等地约种了二万四千多亩。
    云南省种植咖啡的计划已初步确定，在第二个五年计划内，要在德宏、思茅、临沧等地种植咖啡三十万亩。
