    Tempering
    ——Interviews with Five Intellectual People's Representatives
    Xie Gang Xu Juru Zhang Xizhi
    In the hall of the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress, more than seven hundred representatives are waging a fierce counterattack against right-wing elements.
    In more than ten days of fighting, we have seen the majority of intellectual representatives throw themselves into the struggle and begin to grasp the experience of class struggle. Many of them have gradually become alert and grown up in this struggle.
    During a break in the battle, we interviewed several representatives. They are Xu Senyu, a seventy-year-old cultural relics expert, Cheng Junying, a female professor at East China Normal University, famous dramatists Yu Zhenfei and Xu Yulan, and cartoonist Zhang Leping. Although they each have their own feelings, they all mentioned a common term in unison: standpoint.
    Standpoint, this ordinary yet serious word, was often heard in people's mouths in the past, but it has never been talked about so much and so deeply as recently. People increasingly feel that standpoint implies something more serious than life.
        Xu Senyu's Blade Remains Sharp
    Mr. Xu Senyu, at the advanced age of seventy-seven, appears in the venue every day with the help of a cane. He quoted a sentence from the "Analects," "If I hear the Tao in the morning, I can die in the evening," to express his recent excitement. Is he old? Just look at how, in the face-to-face struggle with right-wing elements, he often slams the table and rises to his feet, angrily making statements, each sentence hitting the key points of the right-wingers. Who says this old man's "blade" is dull! When Han Ming was spreading rumors, saying, "Today's science is about finding a few famous scientists to deceive people," Mr. Xu stood up and refuted this right-wing element's slander with eloquence and an example. Mr. Xu said that he had a classmate named Chen Ciqing in his early years, who studied steelmaking in England. Before liberation, he was down and out and had to work as a bookkeeper in a cloth shop. After liberation, the state immediately reused him, and he is now an engineer at the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant. Isn't this evidence that the Party truly cares for scientists?
    Mr. Xu is a cultural relics expert. When it comes to cultural relics, he has even more feelings. Some people say that cultural relics work can do without the leadership of the Party. Mr. Xu said, "No way." He told reporters about an event from six years ago: In order to purchase the "Er Xi" calligraphy (works by the Wang Xizhi brothers of the Jin Dynasty) that had been lost among the people, a central leader and he sought them out everywhere. During that period, they received several long-distance calls from Premier Zhou from Beijing, inquiring about the progress of the work and any difficulties. The Premier's instructions were very specific. Speaking of this, Mr. Xu said: "Someone who does not understand the Party's emphasis on cultural relics work would find it difficult to imagine that a Premier with so many things to manage every day would care so deeply about the 'Er Xi' calligraphy." Let's talk about the development of the Palace Museum in Beijing. In the past eight years, the number of antiques has expanded to dozens of times that before liberation. Presenting these facts makes it easy to understand the great work the Party has done in this area, and the question of whether the Party can lead cultural relics work is also resolved.
    Mr. Xu concluded, "Through the anti-rightist struggle, I trust the Party even more. Although I am over seventy years old, I will continue to transform my thinking. The problem is clear: without transformation, I cannot stand firm, I cannot distinguish right from wrong, and I cannot do a good job in scientific research for the country."
      Yu Zhenfei's Admonitory Words on the Lessons of the Past
    Yu Zhenfei chuckled with a mix of amusement and annoyance when he talked about the right-wing elements' frenzy to "develop" him into their organization this spring. Chen Renbing and Xia Gaoyang clung to him like leeches. One said the China Democratic League was good, the other said the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party was wonderful. This one called, that one sent people over, "Respectfully prepared a small feast, respectfully invite your presence." A letter from the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party arrived, and when he opened it, it was an "Application for Party Membership"! Chen Renbing personally promised, "After you join the League, you don't have to attend meetings if you're afraid of them; you don't have to study if you don't want to; as long as you join the China Democratic League, your role in the theater world will be even greater." Listening to such flowery words, Yu Zhenfei became more and more disgusted. At the time, he merely felt, "Why, these people still have the style of old politicians?" Now, he understands that they are right-wingers! They were pulling people in everywhere, preparing to accumulate strength to turn China into a "second Hungarian event."
    The lesson of the Hungarian event is the most unforgettable for Yu Zhenfei. He saw that the restoration of the bourgeoisie in Hungary in just a few days meant the loss of so many people's lives and property, and the beheading of so many leftists and revolutionary people. Yu Zhenfei said, "Today, we are only asking the right-wingers to bow their heads and admit their guilt, which is still a lenient treatment for them. If they were to gain power, let alone the Communist Party members, our heads would be hard to protect." He especially felt that the anti-rightist struggle is truly a life-and-death struggle.
    "Of course," Yu Zhenfei said, "Participating in the anti-rightist struggle is the best ideological tempering for intellectuals. I remember during the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements, I was still in Hong Kong. At that time, I thought: asking someone like me to fight a friend is probably impossible. Sentimentality is a common ailment of intellectuals, especially since I am already in my fifties, emphasizing the 'golden rule'—whatever it is, just touch on it and be done, unwilling to go too far or get to the root of things. Only this time, I have finally thoroughly understood. The struggle between the enemy and us concerns life and death; no friendship can be considered. If we do not firmly take a stand and thoroughly defeat the right-wingers, the Hungarian event will be a painful lesson from the past."
        Cheng Junying's One Lesson
    Isn't Professor Cheng Junying suffering from liver disease?
    Yes. Her liver disease has plagued her for more than ten years. That was during the difficult years of the Anti-Japanese War. Although she and her husband were both teaching at the university, their monthly income was less than one dan of rice. Beset by poverty and illness, she began to develop liver disease. This disease brought her a lot of trouble. Doing a little more work would give her headaches and insomnia. But surprisingly, in this anti-rightist struggle at East China Normal University, she attended meetings, spoke, and wrote articles all day long, and her liver disease did not defeat her. Why? She said it was simple: we must never let the old days return.
    Professor Cheng Junying did not recognize the true colors of the right-wing elements from the beginning. In the early stages of the blooming and contending at East China Normal University, when she heard the fallacies of right-wing elements such as Xu Jie, she once said, "When making suggestions to the Party, we must pay attention to our standpoint and motives." Before she could finish speaking, she was immediately besieged by right-wing elements, who scolded her for "flattering." At that time, although she was angry, she thought, "Forget it, don't fight back, lest I cause trouble for Xu Jie, the department head." After the People's Daily published the editorial "Why is this so?", she joined the struggle to tear apart the facade with the right-wing elements. In the ten days of fighting at the People's Congress, she was very moved to hear the workers' representatives speak so firmly and bravely. From this, she realized that there was still a gap between the intellectuals' standpoint, feelings, and the working class. Why were the workers so unreservedly participating in the struggle, while she could not immediately rise up to refute the right-wing fallacies during the blooming and contending, but instead "feared offending people"? Isn't this still individualism and a matter of standpoint?
    In these ten days of fighting, Professor Cheng Junying gained a valuable lesson. She said that she found the path for intellectual transformation in the struggle, which is to first have the same firm standpoint and the spirit of daring to defend the truth as the worker comrades. She also stated that no matter how busy she is or how bad her health is in the future, she must study Marxism-Leninism and participate in actual struggles. What is the use of intellectuals having knowledge if they are separated from Marxism-Leninism and actual struggles?
        Xu Yulan's Remorse
    Xu Yulan said, "When the anti-rightist struggle began, I was still swinging in mid-air. Now, I have landed on the soil of socialism."
    Xu Yulan frankly said that the actors who came from the old society were deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology. In the early stages of the blooming and contending, she was also confused by the right-wing rhetoric. She could not distinguish between Chu Anping's fallacy of "the Party's world" at first. Although she did not agree with describing the Party leaders harshly as "big monks," she felt that these people dared to make suggestions and admired their "spirit of courage." At that time, the right-wing elements in the Yue opera circle also pretended to be speaking out for the actors, clamoring for such things as "the current actors are burying their youth." Xu Yulan did not think calmly and simply thought that it was always good to speak for the actors, so she resonated with them in her thinking.
    When the anti-rightist struggle began, Xu Yulan was once confused. She wondered: is the Party's policy of blooming and contending going back on its word? However, as more and more right-wing crimes were revealed, Xu Yulan's doubts gradually dissipated, especially the exposure of the right-wing elements in the Yue Opera Troupe, which truly brought her out of the misty fog.
    Is the actor's youth being buried? Is my own youth being buried? She began to think calmly: calculate how many plays the Yue Opera Troupe performs in a year, and she has also performed abroad. Was this possible in the old society? Xu Yulan began to wake up.
    Who buried the actors' youth after all? Xu Yulan immediately thought of Xiao Dan Gui's death. Xu Yulan said: "At that time, the actors' youth was controlled by gangsters. Xiao Dan Gui was forced to commit suicide because of the bullying of the gangster Zhang Chunfan. At that time, the sisters in the Yue Opera circle sympathized with her and unanimously stopped performing, demanding that Zhang Chunfan be dealt with. However, did the reactionary government care about the actors? Zhang Chunfan was still at large, and he even threatened us: You yellow-haired girls, be careful, do you still want your heads! It was not until after liberation that the Communist Party avenged us." Then she said: "If we still complain that the Communist Party has buried the actors' youth, then we are ungrateful; I was so confused at the time, it's really regrettable."
    Xu Yulan has recently figured it out. Why are workers and peasants so sensitive to the right-wing elements' anti-Party fallacies? When many people were still wavering, they had already held forums and opposed them first. That's because they have a clear class standpoint, and the reason why she once wavered also shows that she still has remnants of bourgeois ideology that have not been completely eliminated. She said: "This has really educated me a lot. I understand that it is not only necessary to care about business but also to care about politics, because this concerns the fate of the entire country. Without socialism, can we even talk about business?"
    Zhang Leping's Unforgettable Event
    Cartoonist Zhang Leping went straight to the point and talked about how he was fooled by the right-wing elements in the early stages of the blooming and contending. At a municipal propaganda conference, Shen Zhiyuan clamored that the Party was managing too much and too rigidly. At the same time, he named the cartoonists, wanting to make his words visualized and draw a cartoon. That night, Zhang Leping and Zhang Wenyuan, a cartoonist from the China Democratic League, collaborated on a drawing called "Hardworking 'Housekeeper.'" The next day, it was published in the Liberation Daily along with Shen Zhiyuan's speech.
    Zhang Leping's paintings were often welcomed by readers, but after this erroneous painting was published, readers wrote letters criticizing it. But at this time, Shen Zhiyuan praised him, and the China Democratic League also sent people to pull him into the League. Now, Zhang Leping especially experiences who likes his erroneous cartoon and who hates it.
    From this, Zhang Leping also realized that it is not easy for intellectuals to completely change their standpoint. He said: I was born into the petty bourgeoisie and contaminated by the filth of the old society. Before liberation, I didn't understand what standpoint was. I drew "Sanmao" because I also came from a suffering background. I sympathized with the plight of suffering children. When I drew them, I only felt that my heart was fair and I spoke with conscience. After liberation, I didn't study enough. Although I experienced a series of movements, I didn't seriously throw myself into them. Only this time did I realize that this is a struggle related to the life and death of socialism, a test of the intellectuals' standpoint.

    ——访五位知识分子人民代表
    谢刚　徐鞠如　张习之
    在上海市人民代表大会的会场里，七百多位代表正在对右派分子进行着一场激烈的反击战。
    十多天战斗，我们看到多数的知识分子代表投身到斗争中，开始掌握到阶级斗争的经验，他们中的很多人在这场斗争中逐步地警觉过来，成长起来了。
    战斗空隙中，我们访问了几位代表。他们是七十多岁的文物专家徐森玉、华东师大的女教授程俊英、著名的戏剧家俞振飞、徐玉兰、漫画家张乐平，他们虽然各有各的感受，但都异口同声地提到一个共同的名词：立场。
    立场，这个平凡而又严肃的词儿，过去经常听到人口头谈起，但，从来没有像最近谈得这样多，这样深刻。人们越来越觉得：立场，意味着比生命更为严重的内容。
        徐森玉宝刀不老
    七十七岁高龄的徐森玉老先生每天扶着拐杖，出现在会场。他引用“论语”一句“朝闻道夕死可矣”，来表达自己最近的激动心情。他老了么？且看在和右派分子面对面的斗争中，他经常拍案而起，愤怒陈词，句句打中右派要害。谁说此老“宝刀”已老！韩鸣在造谣，“今天的科学是找几个名牌科学家来骗人。”徐老就挺身而起，用一个例子，雄辩地驳斥了这个右派分子的污蔑。徐老说，他早年有个名叫陈次青的同学，在英国学炼钢的，解放前，落魄潦倒，不得不到一家布店担任账房。解放以后，国家立即重用他，现在是马鞍山钢铁厂的工程师。难道这不是党真正关怀科学家的证据吗？
    徐老是文物专家。谈到文物，他的感想更多。有人说，文物工作可以不要党的领导。徐老说，不行。他为记者谈起六年前的一段往事：为了收买流失民间的“二希”帖（晋王羲之兄弟的作品），中央一位负责同志和他一道四处寻求。那段时期，他们接到好几次周总理从北京打来的长途电话，关心工作进展的情况，有什么困难等等。总理的指示非常具体。谈到这里，徐老说：一个不了解党重视文物工作的人，是很难想像以一位日理万几的总理，竟然对“二希”帖如此深切关怀。再谈谈北京故宫博物院的发展情况吧，八年来古物扩大到解放前的几十倍，摆出这些事实，就容易懂得党在这方面做了何等伟大的工作，党能不能领导文物工作的问题，也解决了。
    徐老最后说：“通过反右派斗争，我更信任党了。虽然我已过古稀之年，但是，我还要继续思想改造。问题很明白，不改造，就不能站稳立场，就不能明辨是非，也就不能很好地为国家做好一份研究科学的工作。”
      俞振飞警语说前车
    俞振飞一谈起今春右派分子“发展”他参加组织那股疯劲，好气又好笑。陈仁炳、夏高阳死缠住他。一个说民盟好，一个说农工妙。这个打电话，那个派人来，“敬备菲酌，恭请光临。”农工的信来了，拆开一看：“入党申请书”！陈仁炳则亲口许愿：“你入盟后，怕开会就可以不开；不愿学习就不学；只要你参加了民盟，对戏剧界的作用就更大了。”一派花言巧语，俞振飞越听越反感。当时还仅仅觉得，“怎么，这些人还是一派旧政客作风？”现在，明白了，是右派！他们到处拉人，无非准备积蓄力量把中国搞成个“匈牙利事件第二”。
    匈牙利事件的教训，俞振飞最是难忘。他看到，匈牙利资产阶级复辟仅仅几天功夫，就意味着多少人民生命财产的损失，多少左派人士和革命人民的人头落地。俞振飞说：“今天我们只要求右派低头认罪，还是给他们的宽大待遇。如果他们得势，别说共产党员，我们的头也难保。”他特别体会到反右派斗争真是一场你死我活的斗争。
    “当然”，俞振飞说：“参加反右派斗争对知识分子说来，也就是最好的思想锻炼。记得三反、五反时，我还在香港，当时我想：要我这样一个人去斗一个朋友，恐怕无论如何也办不到。温情主义是知识分子通病，而况年已五十开外，讲究的是“忠恕”之道，随便甚么，点一下就算了，不愿过分，不愿追根。只有这一次，总算彻底明白了。敌我之间的斗争，关系生死，讲不得半点交情。要不坚定立场，彻底打垮右派，匈牙利事件，就是惨重的前车之鉴。
        程俊英一条教训
    程俊英教授不是患肝病么！
    是的。她的肝病害了十几年了，那时是抗日战争艰苦的年月，他们两夫妇虽然都在大学任教，但每月收入不到一担米。贫病交迫，开始得上了肝病。这场病给她带来很大的麻烦，多做一点事，就头痛失眠。但是，奇怪！在这次华东师大反右派斗争中，她一天到晚开会、讲话，写文章，肝病并没有难倒她。为甚么？她说，很简单，就是绝不能让旧日子回来。
    程俊英教授也并不是一开始就认清右派分子的嘴脸的。华东师大鸣放初期，她听到许杰等右派分子的谬论，曾经说了一句：“向党提意见要注意立场和动机。”话犹未了，立刻受到右派分子围攻，骂她“拍马屁”。那时，她虽然气愤，但是，却又转念一想：“算了，不要顶起来，招来系主任许杰的麻烦。”人民日报发表了“这是为什么”的社论后，她才投入了同右派分子的撕破情面的斗争。人代会上十几天的战斗，她听了工人代表的发言都是那样坚定、勇敢，使她非常感动。从这里，她体会到了知识分子的立场、感情和工人阶级是还有一段距离的。为什么工人就是那样的无保留地参加斗争，而自己在鸣放时就不能立即起来反驳右派谬论，反而“怕得罪人”，这还不是个人主义思想，和立场问题吗？
    这十天的战斗，程俊英教授得到了一条宝贵教训，她说她在斗争中找到了知识分子改造的道路，这就是首先要有和工人同志一样的坚定的立场，勇于捍卫真理的精神。她并且表示：今后无论怎样忙，身体多么不好，马列主义不能不学习，实际斗争不能不参加。知识分子离开了马列主义和实际斗争，有了知识又有什么用？
        徐玉兰的懊恼
    徐玉兰说：“反右派斗争开始时，我还在半空中荡，现在，我降落在社会主义的土地上了。”
    徐玉兰坦率地说，从旧社会来的演员受到的资产阶级思想影响很深，鸣放初期，她也受过右派言论的迷惑。储安平“党天下”的谬论，她当初就辨别不清，尽管她不同意把党的领导人刻薄地形容成“大和尚”；可是她又觉得这种人敢于提意见，佩服他们的“勇敢精神”。那时，越剧界的右派分子也装出为演员鸣不平的姿态，叫嚣“现在的演员是埋没青春”这类话。徐玉兰没有冷静思考，单纯以为为演员说话总是好的，因此，在思想上起了共鸣。
    反右派斗争开始，徐玉兰一度困惑。她怀疑：党的鸣放政策难道是出尔反尔吗？但是，右派罪恶愈揭愈多，徐玉兰的疑团才逐渐消散，尤其是越剧团的右派分子的揭露，真正使她从迷蒙的烟雾中走了出来。
    演员的青春是埋没了吗？自己的青春是不是被埋没了呢？她开始冷静地考虑了一下：算一算，越剧院一年要演出多少戏，她还出国演出过，这在旧社会是可能的吗？徐玉兰开始清醒了。
    到底谁埋没了演员的青春？徐玉兰马上想到筱丹桂之死。徐玉兰说：“那时候演员的青春是被流氓掌握着的。筱丹桂因为流氓张春帆的欺压而被迫自杀。当时，越剧界的姊妹同情她一律停演，要求处理张春帆，但是，反动政府那里把演员放在眼里，张春帆照样逍遥法外，而且还威胁我们：你们这种黄毛丫头当心点，你们的头还要不要！直到解放以后，共产党才为我们报了仇。”接着她说：“如果我们还要埋怨，说是共产党把演员的青春埋没了，那才是忘恩负义呢；我当时竟然糊涂到如此地步，真是懊恼。”
    徐玉兰最近想通了。为什么工人、农民，对右派分子的反党谬论那么敏感，当很多人还是摇摆不定的时候，他们已经举行座谈会，首先反对了。那是因为他们有明确的阶级立场，而她所以曾经一度动摇过，也正说明她还有资产阶级思想的残余没有消除干净，她说：“这次对我的教育真不小。我懂得不仅只是关心业务，更要关心政治，因为这关系着整个国家的命运。没有了社会主义，还谈得到业务吗？”
    张乐平难忘的一件事
    漫画家张乐平开门见山就谈起了鸣放初期他上过右派分子的当。那是在市委宣传会议上，沈志远一面叫嚣党管得太多太死了，一面点漫画家的名要把他的话形象化，画一幅漫画，当晚，张乐平就和民盟漫画家张文元合作了一幅“辛辛苦苦的‘当家人’”，第二天，和沈志远的发言一起刊在解放日报上。
    张乐平的画本来常常受到读者欢迎的，这幅错误的画登出后，读者来信指责了，可就在这时，沈志远表扬他了，民盟也派人来拉他入盟了，现在，张乐平才格外体验到他这幅错误的漫画，究竟被谁欢喜？为谁痛恨？
    由此，张乐平也体会到知识分子彻底转变立场是不简单的。他说：我出身于小资产阶级，沾染了旧社会的污泥，解放前，我不懂得什么是立场，我画“三毛”，是因为我自己也是受苦出身，我同情受苦难的孩子的遭遇，我画他们只觉得我心地公平，讲良心。解放以后，学习也不够，虽也经历了一系列运动，但是并没有严肃地投身到运动中去。只有这一次，我才体会到这是关系到社会主义生死存亡的斗争，是知识分子锻炼立场的一场考验。（原载新闻日报本报略有删节）
