Keynes's economic theory is the ideology of the imperialist bourgeoisie. It serves the imperialist bourgeoisie. In the history of economic thought, its position belongs to an important school of vulgar economics in the stage of monopoly capital rule. Its task is to dogmatize the vulgar concepts of the monopoly capital giants about the capitalist system and declare them to be the truth. On the one hand, it defends the capitalist system, and on the other hand, it attacks Marxist-Leninist political economy and the living standards of the working class. Chen Zhenhan and his followers, such as Xu Yutan, in their draft economic program, emphasized criticizing Marxist-Leninist political economy and accepting the concepts and methods in Keynes's general theory of employment to build socialism. In practice, this is an attempt to subvert China's socialist construction with Keynes's concepts and methods, thereby restoring the restoration of imperialism and its comprador in China. Because in Keynes's general theory of employment, all the basic concepts and research methods are for the service of monopoly capital giants, and they are anti-scientific and anti-people. They absolutely cannot be used to build socialist economy, but can only be used as tools for imperialism and its comprador and bourgeois right-wingers to destroy China's socialist construction.

Now I will talk about why all the basic concepts and research methods in Keynes's general theory of employment absolutely cannot be used to build socialism, but can only be used to destroy socialist construction and attempt the restoration of imperialism.

II

There are six basic concepts in Keynes's general theory of employment. All these six basic concepts, in Marx's words, are concepts of vulgar economics. Because they all dogmatize the bourgeoisie's vulgar concepts of capitalist society and attempt to make some specious explanations for superficial economic phenomena to meet the needs of capitalists.

Among these six basic concepts, the first is the concept that capitalism is superior to socialism. Keynes said: "It seems to me that capitalism, if intelligently managed, is probably the most efficient of any other visible economic system in achieving economic goals." This concept is Keynes's tool for destroying socialist revolution and construction. Of course, it cannot be used to build socialism.

The second is the concept of full employment. It should be emphasized that Keynes's concept of full employment, though verbally full employment, is essentially a concept of forced unemployment for progressive workers. Why is it said that it is a concept of forced unemployment for progressive workers? As everyone knows, among the unemployed workers, there are two types of unemployment: one is the unemployment of workers who are willing to have their real wages reduced but still cannot find a job; the other is the unemployment of progressive workers who oppose the reduction of real wages and are therefore excluded by capitalists. Full employment should include the employment of these two types of unemployed workers. However, Keynes's "full employment" does not refer to the full employment of both types of unemployed workers, but only to the full employment of the first type of unemployed workers. Therefore, Keynes's full employment is only partial, that is, false full employment, and cannot be called true full employment. Keynes believes that when prices rise, money wages cannot rise, and workers must allow their real wages to be reduced before they should get a job; if workers demand an increase in money wages when prices rise, then all those workers who are unemployed because of demanding an increase in money wages, no matter how many they are, are to blame themselves, and capitalists cannot control it. This kind of unemployment is voluntary and should not be called unemployment. Therefore, the concept of full employment should not include the employment of voluntarily unemployed workers. Therefore, it can be said that Keynes's concept of full employment is not only not a true concept of full employment in essence, but also a concept of forced unemployment for progressive workers. From this, it can be seen that Keynes's concept of full employment is not to enable all workers to get employment according to their current living standards or higher living standards, but to make progressive workers who are unwilling to have their real wages reduced and rise up against it unemployed, thereby using the unemployment of these workers as a lever to further reduce the real wages of workers. Stalin said: No capitalist will ever agree to completely eliminate the phenomenon of unemployment, the reserve army of unemployment. Because the mission of the reserve army of unemployment is to oppress the labor market and ensure cheap labor. This sentence is fully applicable to Keynes's full employment theory. Obviously, no socialist country can accept Keynes's false concept of full employment to force progressive workers to be unemployed and use it as a lever to reduce workers' real wages. May I ask Chen Zhenhan and his followers, such as Xu Yutan, etc., can we accept this concept to build socialism?

The third is the concept of marginal labor product of workers. This concept says that the wages of workers are equal to the marginal labor product of workers. It means that the wages of workers have recovered all the labor results produced by the workers. Since the wages of workers have recovered all the labor results of the workers, of course, the revolution of the working class becomes an infringement on the sacred property rights of the capitalists, and should be invited into prison or shot. The bourgeoisie once used this concept as a basis to slaughter thousands of proletarian revolutionary brothers. May I ask Chen Zhenhan and Xu Yutan, etc., can we accept this concept?

The fourth is the concept of the marginal efficiency of capital. This concept says that the capitalists' rate of profit is the reward for the efficiency of capital production. Sometimes Keynes also said that it is the income of the capitalists and entrepreneurs from managing the enterprise. This means that the capitalists' rate of profit and the amount of profit do not come from capital's exploitation of labor. Obviously, this concept is Keynes's biased flattery and defense of the capitalists. May I ask Chen Zhenhan and his followers, such as Xu Yutan, etc., can we accept Keynes's concept of marginal efficiency of capital to defend surplus value?

The fifth is the concept of flexible preference. This concept says that interest comes from the reward that money owners should get for the sacrifice of the flexibility of money. That is, the reward that should be obtained for the sacrifice of the use of money. Obviously, this concept represents the view of financial capitalists on interest and is a biased and flattering defense of capitalists who sit and eat interest.

The sixth is the concept of diminishing marginal propensity to consume. Its meaning is that in capitalist society, the proportion of consumption expenditure in individual income decreases with the increase of individual income. This means that in capitalist society, the lack of demand for commodities does not depend on the poverty and limited consumption of the masses under the private ownership of the means of production by the capitalists, but on people's psychological tendency towards consumption. As everyone knows, under capitalism, due to the accumulation of capital and the pauperization of the proletariat, the demand for consumer goods is relatively reduced, which is the absolute law of capital accumulation. Keynes's concept of diminishing marginal propensity to consume is used to deny the objective existence of the absolute law of capital accumulation. May I ask Chen Zhenhan and his followers, such as Xu Yutan, etc., can we accept Keynes's concept of diminishing marginal propensity to consume to deny the absolute law of capital accumulation? Can we cover up the essence of things with the superficial phenomena of things?

From this, it can be seen that in Keynes's general theory of employment, all the basic concepts are dogmatization of the bourgeoisie's exploitation consciousness. They are all used to deceive the working class and deny the existence of the law of surplus value. They are enemies of the proletariat, enemies of the people, and enemies of science.

III

Chen Zhenhan and his followers, such as Xu Yutan, etc., not only advocated absorbing Keynes's anti-scientific and anti-people economic concepts to help socialist construction, scientific construction, and economic construction, but also emphasized absorbing Keynes's economic analysis methods to guide economic research work and the work of financial and economic departments. It should be pointed out that Keynes's analysis method, like his economic concepts, is also permeated with the prejudices of the exploiting class. Therefore, it cannot be used to build socialism, but can only be used as a tool to destroy socialist construction.

From Keynes's general theory of employment, it is known that the method used by Keynes is not a scientific method, but only the typification of the tricks commonly used by monopoly capital giants to bully the working class. Even the metaphysical way of thinking is not enough. This kind of typified trick is of course also used to paralyze the revolutionary consciousness of the working class and attack the living standards of the working class.

Keynes's typified tricks are reflected in the model method used by Keynes in economic analysis. When Keynes analyzes the employment relationship of workers, he must first construct an economic model in his mind as the object of analysis. Then, based on this economic model, he analyzes the employment problem. This method is the model method used by Keynes. However, Keynes is extremely dishonest when constructing his analytical model. Because in his analytical model, many realistic conditions that are extremely important to workers' unemployment are put aside. It should be emphasized that Keynes, in his economic research model, intentionally put aside the conditions of monopoly rule, and only assumed the conditions of free competition; intentionally put aside the conditions of technological progress, and only assumed the conditions of unchanged technology; intentionally put aside the conditions of increasing labor returns, and only assumed the conditions of diminishing labor returns; intentionally put aside the conditions of capital accumulation, the increase of the organic composition of capital, and the relative decrease of labor demand, and only assumed the conditions of fixed capital unchanged, the organic composition of capital unchanged, and the labor demand not relatively decreased. Keynes used these unrealistic conditions he assumed to study the relationship between the change of workers' employment with the change of monetary expenditure on commodities, or in Keynes's words, with the absolute and relative change of effective demand of commodities, to study the fundamental cause of unemployment and the method of curing it. Of course, in the economic model he fabricated, that is, under the unrealistic conditions he fabricated, he will get the conclusion he wants to get: the fundamental cause of workers' unemployment is only because workers do not agree to have their real wages reduced, or demand an increase in money wages. If workers can agree to have their real wages reduced, or do not demand an increase in money wages when prices rise, then under regulated capitalism, "full employment" can be achieved. Because the conditions assumed in Keynes's economic model do not exist objectively, the diagnosis and prescription he put forward for workers' unemployment cannot achieve the expected effect. Although the prescription he prescribed, after being taken by the capitalists, also played a slight role of morphine. To say it again, Keynes's economic analysis model method is a typical trick for the working class that does not proceed from objective conditions, but only from the wishes of monopoly capitalists. If the working class is unfortunately tricked by him, then they can only be slaves to the bourgeoisie forever, and there is no other way out.

Keynes, in the monopoly stage of capitalism, in his model for analyzing employment relations, wanted to put aside the conditions of monopoly rule and only assume the conditions of free competition, in essence, he wanted to cover up the rule of monopoly capital giants with free competition. To make the working class believe that the capitalists today are still the capitalists in the era of free competition, so that the rate of profit they get is the average rate of profit that is decreasing day by day, and workers must have capitalists, and capitalists must obtain the expected minimum rate of profit. If the capitalists are really passive because they cannot get the expected minimum rate of profit, then the enterprise will close down and the workers will be unemployed. Therefore, when prices rise, the working class must not demand an increase in money wages, but should work according to the existing money wages when prices rise, to give capitalists encouragement. From this, it can be seen that the only purpose of Keynes's abandonment of the conditions of monopoly capital rule and only assuming the conditions of free competition in his employment research model is to help monopoly capitalists to make a frenzied attack on the living standards of the working class. If it were not for this despicable purpose, then why did Keynes live in the era of monopoly capital, not talk about the rule of monopoly capital, but only talk about free competition? This is completely unimaginable.

With the increase in the number of employees, the returns to labor have historically increased. In the era of the general crisis of capitalism, under the conditions of insufficient enterprise operation, the returns to labor are also increasing even under the conditions of unchanged technology. However, Keynes, in his employment research model, ignored the trend of increasing labor returns and the conditions of insufficient operation of British enterprises in 1936. He only talked about the "law of diminishing marginal product of labor" in the fabricated conditions of unchanged technological level. What is this for? It is for him to deceive the working class and say: "Your labor product is decreasing with the increase in the number of your employees, therefore, your real wages should also be reduced." So as to achieve the purpose of reducing the real wages of workers. If it were not for this despicable purpose, why not talk about increasing labor returns when labor returns are increasing, but only talk about diminishing labor returns? This is unimaginable.

In the era of capitalist large industry, the employment of workers depends on the two major factors of capital accumulation and the increase of the organic composition of capital. In the era of monopoly capitalism, with the accumulation of capital and the increase of the organic composition of capital, the demand for labor is decreasing day by day. Especially because natural science is increasingly developed, the automatic equipment in factories is increasing day by day. Under the conditions of continuous increase of capital accumulation and the organic composition of capital, the relative reduction of labor demand will inevitably lead to the birth of a relative surplus population, and will inevitably make the army of unemployment a permanent companion of capitalism. However, in Keynes's model for analyzing employment, he avoids talking about the increase of the organic composition of capital, and only talks about the increase of labor demand under the conditions of unchanged organic composition of capital. For example, in his general theory of employment, Keynes first assumes that the technical conditions are unchanged, the unit cost is unchanged, and the supply curve is unchanged, which means that the organic composition of capital is unchanged. Keynes clearly knew that if the accumulation of capital and the increase of the organic composition of capital were taken into account, then his theory of full employment would lose the possibility of deceiving workers. In order to achieve this shameful purpose, Keynes decided to cover up the increase of the organic composition of capital with the unchanged organic composition of capital, so that the working class would believe that as long as the workers are willing to accept lower real wages to expand the need for labor, then full employment can be achieved. This makes it more guaranteed for monopoly capitalists to reduce the real wages of workers and increase the profits of capitalists. From this, it can be seen that Keynes's use of the unchanged organic composition of capital to cover up the increase of the organic composition of capital is also to deceive the workers. If it were not for the realization of this despicable purpose, then why should he completely ignore the increase of the organic composition of capital, which is of great significance to workers' unemployment in practice, and only talk about the unchanged organic composition of capital, which has no practical significance for workers' employment in practice? This is also unimaginable.

It should be emphasized that Keynes's model method in economic analysis is essentially different from the "abstraction method" used by Marx in Capital. The former proceeds from the wishes of monopoly capitalists, and the latter proceeds from objective existence; the former is a deceitful technique at will, and the latter is a scientific method based on facts. Chen Zhenhan and his followers, such as Xu Yutan, etc., want to use Keynes's trick to build socialism. Its essence is to use it to destroy socialist construction, so as to realize the restoration of capitalism.

IV

Political economy is partisan. The bourgeoisie's economics, especially the vulgar economics in the era of monopoly capital rule, especially Keynes's theory, serves the imperialist bourgeoisie and its comprador. It is the enemy of the proletariat, the enemy of the working people, and the enemy of science. For the benefit of China's 600 million people, for the benefit of the proletariat all over the world, and for the defense of the socialist system, we must hold high the banner of Marxist-Leninist theory, and thoroughly criticize the economics of monopoly capital giants, especially Keynes's theory, including its basic concepts and analysis methods; and thoroughly criticize the anti-socialist economic program put forward by Chen Zhenhan and his followers, such as Xu Yutan, etc.

    凯恩斯的基本概念和方法有什么价值
    北京大学教授　樊弘
    一
    凯恩斯的经济学说，是帝国主义资产阶级的意识形态。它是为帝国主义资产阶级服务的。在经济学说发展史上，它的地位是属于庸俗经济学在垄断资本统治阶段的一个重要的学派。它的任务，就是把垄断资本巨头对于资本主义制度的庸俗的观念教条化，并宣布它们是真理。它一方面替资本主义制度辩护，另一方面向马克思列宁主义的政治经济学进攻，向工人阶级的生活水平进攻。陈振汉及其追随者徐毓枬等，在他们所草拟的经济学纲领中，强调批判马克思列宁主义的政治经济学，接受凯恩斯就业一般理论中的概念和方法来建设社会主义。这在实际上就是企图以凯恩斯的概念和方法，来颠覆中国的社会主义建设，从而恢复帝国主义及其买办在中国的复辟。因为在凯恩斯就业一般理论中，所有的一切基本概念和研究方法，都是为垄断资本巨头服务的，都是反科学的和反人民的。它们绝对不可以用来建设社会主义经济，而只能用来作为帝国主义及其买办、替资产阶级右派分子破坏中国社会主义建设的工具。
    现在我来谈谈，为什么在凯恩斯的就业一般理论中，所有一切的基本概念和研究方法都是绝对不可以用来建设社会主义，而只可以用来破坏社会主义建设和企图帝国主义的复辟的。
    二
    在凯恩斯的就业一般理论中共有六个基本概念，所有这六个基本概念，用马克思的话来说，都是庸俗经济学的概念。因为他们都是把资产阶级对于资本主义社会的庸俗观念教条化和企图对于表面的经济现象，作些似是而非的解释，以备资本家的需要的。
    在这六个基本概念中，第一个就是资本主义比社会主义优越的概念。凯恩斯说过：“在我看来资本主义如果聪明底加以管理，比较任何其他看得见的经济制度，从实现经济的目的上说，大概是最有效率的。”这个概念是凯恩斯用来破坏社会主义革命和建设的工具。当然不可能用来建设社会主义。
    第二个是充分就业的概念。应当着重地指出，凯恩斯的充分就业的概念，在文字上，虽是充分就业，在本质上乃是强制进步工人失业的概念。为什么说它是强制进步工人失业的概念呢？如众周知，在失业工人中，有两类工人的失业：一是愿意实际工资被降低，但还找不到工作的工人的失业。二是反对实际工资被降低，因而为资本家所排斥的进步工人的失业。充分就业应包含这两种失业工人的就业。但凯恩斯的“充分就业”，并不是兼指两类失业工人的充分就业，而是专指第一类失业工人的充分就业。所以凯恩斯的充分就业只是部分的，即是虚伪的充分就业，而不能称做真正的充分就业。凯恩斯认为，在物价上涨时，货币工资不能上升，工人必须听任他们实际工资被降低，才应得到工作；如果在物价上涨的情况下，工人要求增加货币工资，那么，凡属这些因为要求增加货币工资因而失业的工人，不问他们有多少，都是咎由自取，资本家要管也管不了。这种失业是自愿的，不应称做失业。因此，在充分就业的概念中，就不应该包含自愿失业的工人的就业。所以说凯恩斯的充分就业的概念，在本质上不但不是真正的充分就业的概念，而且是强制进步工人失业的概念。由此可见，凯恩斯的充分就业的概念，并不是要使所有的工人依照现在的生活水平或更高的生活水平，都能得到就业，而是要使不甘心于实际工资被降低并起而反抗它的进步工人失业，从而，把这些工人的失业作为更进一步降低工人的实际工资的杠杆。斯大林说过：不论哪一个资本家，从来不会而且无论如何也不会同意完全消灭失业的现象，消灭失业后备军。因为失业后备军的使命，就是压迫劳动市场，保证工资低廉的劳动人手。这一句话，对于凯恩斯的充分就业理论完全适用。显然，任何社会主义的国家，都是不能接受凯恩斯的虚伪的充分就业的概念，来强制进步工人失业，并把它作为降低工人的实际工资的杠杆的。请问陈振汉和他的追随者徐毓枬等，我们能接受这个概念来建设社会主义么？
    第三个是工人的边际劳动生产物的概念。这个概念说，工人的工资等于工人的边际劳动生产物。意思是说，工人的工资业已收回工人所生产的全部劳动的成果。工人的工资既已收回工人的全部劳动的成果，当然，工人阶级的革命就变为侵犯资本家的神圣财产的权利，而应当请进监狱或枪毙。资产阶级曾经使用这个概念作根据来屠杀成千成万的无产阶级的革命弟兄。请问陈振汉和徐毓枬等，我们能接受这个概念么？
    第四个是资本的边际效率的概念。这个概念说，资本家的利润率，乃是资本的生产的效率的酬报。有时凯恩斯还说，它是资本家企业家经营管理企业的劳动的所得。这即是说，资本家的利润率和利润量都不是来自资本对劳动的剥削。显然，这个概念是凯恩斯对于资本家所提供的偏颇的阿谀和辩护。请问陈振汉和他的追随者徐毓枬等，我们能接受凯恩斯的资本的边际效率的概念来给剩余价值辩护么？
    第五个是灵活的偏好的概念。这个概念说，利息是来自货币所有者对于货币的灵活性的牺牲所当取得的酬报。即是对于货币的用途的牺牲所当取得的酬报。显然，这个概念乃是代表金融资本家对于利息的看法，和对坐吃利息的资本家所作的偏颇的和阿谀的辩护。
    第六个是边际的消费需求递减的概念。它的意思是说，在资本主义社会中，消费的支出在个人的收入中所占的比例随着个人收入的增加而降低。这即是说，在资本主义社会中，商品的需求的缺乏，不是取决于在资本家的生产资料私有制下大众的贫困和有限的消费，而是取决于人们关于消费的心理的倾向。如大家所知道的，在资本主义下，由于资本的积累和无产阶级的贫困化，从而使消费品的需求相对地降低，乃是资本蓄积的绝对的法则，而凯恩斯的边际消费需求递减的概念，就是用来否认资本蓄积的绝对法则的客观存在。请问陈振汉和他的追随者徐毓枬等，我们能接受凯恩斯的边际消费需求递减的概念来否认资本蓄积的绝对法则么？我们能够以事物的表面的现象来掩盖事物的本质么？
    由此可见，在凯恩斯的就业一般理论中，所有的基本概念，都是资产阶级的剥削意识的教条化。都是用来欺骗工人阶级和否认剩余价值法则的存在的。他们乃是无产阶级之敌、人民之敌和科学之敌。
    三
    陈振汉及其追随者徐毓枬等，不但主张吸收凯恩斯反科学和反人民的经济概念来帮助社会主义建设、科学建设和经济建设，而且强调吸收凯恩斯的经济分析的方法来指导经济研究工作和财经部门的工作。应当指出，凯恩斯的分析方法，如同他的经济概念，也是浸透着剥削阶级的偏见的。因此之故，它也不可能用来建设社会主义，而只能是用来作为破坏社会主义建设的工具。
    从凯恩斯的就业一般理论中，知道凯恩斯所使用的方法，并不是什么科学的方法，而只是把垄断资本巨头所惯常使用来欺侮工人阶级的骗术来典型化。连形而上学的思想方法也不够格。这种典型化的骗术，当然也是用来麻痹工人阶级的革命意识和向工人阶级的生活水平进攻的。
    凯恩斯的典型化的骗术，体现在凯恩斯在经济分析上所应用的模型法中。凯恩斯在分析工人的就业关系时，首先要在他的脑子里构造一个经济的模型，作为分析的对象。然后就此经济模型，对于就业问题进行分析。这个方法，就是凯恩斯所用的模型法。但凯恩斯在构造他的分析模型时，是极不老实的。因为在他的分析模型里，把许多关系工人失业极为重要的现实条件都撇开了。应当着重地指出，凯恩斯在他的经济研究模型中，曾经有意地撇开了垄断统治的条件，只假设了自由竞争的条件。有意地撇开了技术进步的条件，只假定了技术不变的条件；有意地撇开了劳动收益递增的条件，只假定了劳动收益递减的条件；有意地撇开资本的积累、资本的有机构成的提高和劳动力的需求相对的减少诸条件，只假定了在固定资本不变、资本的有机构成不变和劳动力的需求没有相对降低的诸条件。凯恩斯就是在他所假定的这些不现实的条件下，来研究随着对于商品的货币支出的变化，或用凯恩斯的话来说，随着商品的有效需求的绝对的和相对的变化，工人就业变化的关系，来研究失业的根本原因和医治它的方法的。当然，在他所虚构这个经济的模型中，即在他所虚构的这些不现实的条件下，会得到他所希望得到的结论：即工人失业的根本原因只是由于工人不同意他们的实际工资被降低，或要求增加货币工资。如果工人能够同意他们的实际工资被降低，或在物价上涨时不要求增加货币工资，那么，在有调节的资本主义下，是会达到“充分就业”的。由于在凯恩斯的经济模型中所假定的条件，在客观上是不存在的，因此，他所提出的工人失业的诊断书和药方也是不能实现他所预期的效果的。尽管他所开出的药方，经资本家服食之后，亦起了些微的玛琲针的作用。再说一遍，凯恩斯的经济分析的模型法乃是一种不从客观条件出发，专从垄断资本家的愿望出发，对于工人阶级所策划的一种典型化的骗术。工人阶级如果不幸中了他的骗术，那么，他们便只能永远给资产阶级作奴隶，别无什么出路。
    凯恩斯在资本主义的垄断阶段，在他的分析就业关系的模型中之所以要撇开垄断统治的条件并只是假定自由竞争的条件，在本质上，就是想以自由竞争来掩盖垄断资本巨头的统治。使工人阶级相信，好像今日的资本家还是在自由竞争时代的资本家，从而他们所得的利润率乃是日在降低的平均利润率，工人非要资本家不可，资本家非要取得预期的最低的利润率不可。假如资本家真是因为得不到预期的最低的利润率而消极，那么，企业便要关门，工人便要失业了。所以当物价上涨之时，工人阶级千万不要要求增加货币工资，而应在物价涨高之时，按照现存的货币工资工作，给资本家以鼓励。由此可见，凯恩斯之所以要在他的就业研究的模型中，撇开垄断资本统治的条件，只是假设自由竞争的条件，其唯一的目的，只是在于帮助垄断资本家向工人阶级的生活水平猖狂的进攻。如果不是为了这个卑鄙的目的，那么，为什么凯恩斯生在垄断资本的时代，不谈垄断资本的统治，只谈自由竞争呢？这是完全不可以想像的。
    随着就业人数的增加，劳动的收益在历史上是递增的。在资本主义总危机时代，在企业开工不足的条件下，劳动的收益纵令在技术不变的条件下亦是递增的。可是凯恩斯在他的就业研究的模型中，对于劳动收益递增的趋势，和对于1936年英国企业开工不足的条件，均一概置之不论。他只在虚构的技术水平不变的条件下大谈而特谈那“劳动的边际生产物递减的规律”。这是为了什么目的呢？就是为了他要欺骗工人阶级说：“你们的劳动生产物是随着你们就业人数的增加而降低的，因此，你们的实际工资也应降低”。从而达到降低工人的实际工资的目的。如果不是为了这个卑鄙的目的，为什么当劳动的收益递增之际，不谈劳动收益递增，只谈劳动收益递减呢？这是不能想像的。
    在资本主义大工业的时代，工人的就业都是取决于资本的积累和资本的有机构成提高的两大因素，在垄断资本主义时代，随着资本的积累和资本的有机构成的提高，劳动力的需求日益降低。特别是由于自然科学日益发达，工厂中自动化的装备日益增多，在资本的积累和资本的有机构成不断提高的条件下，劳动力的需求相对减少，必然有相对剩余人口的诞生，必然使失业的大军成为资本主义永恒的伴侣。可是在凯恩斯的分析就业的模型中，讳言资本有机构成的提高，只谈在资本有机构成不变的条件下，劳动力的需求的增加。例如凯恩斯在他的就业一般理论中，首先假令技术条件不变，单位成本不变，供给曲线不变，便是资本有机构成不变的意思。凯恩斯清楚地知道，假如把资本的积累和资本有机构成的提高考虑在内，那么，他的充分就业的学说就将失掉欺骗工人的可能性。为了达到这一可耻的目的，凯恩斯决定，以资本的有机构成不变来掩盖资本有机构成的提高，使工人阶级相信，只要工人肯接受更低的实际工资来扩大劳动力的需要，那么，充分就业就能实现。这样就使垄断资本家降低工人实际工资和增加资本家的利润更有了保证。由此可见，凯恩斯用资本有机构成不变来掩盖资本有机构成的提高，也是为了欺骗工人。如果不是为了实现这个卑鄙的目的，那么，为什么他要把这个在实际上对于工人的失业具有莫大意义的资本有机构成的提高，完全撇开不谈，单谈那个在实际上对于工人就业并无什么现实意义的资本有机构成不变呢？这也是不能令人想像的。
    应当着重指出，凯恩斯在经济分析上的模型法，与马克思在资本论中所使用的“抽象法”，是有本质的差别的。前者是从垄断资本家的愿望出发，后者是从客观存在出发的；前者是随心所欲的骗人技术，后者是实事求是的科学方法。陈振汉及其追随者徐毓枬等，想以凯恩斯这种骗术来建设社会主义，其实质就是想以它来破坏社会主义建设，从而实现资本主义的复辟。
    四
    政治经济学是有党性的。资产阶级的经济学，尤其是在垄断资本统治时代的庸俗经济学，特别是凯恩斯学说，是替帝国主义资产阶级及其买办服务的。它是无产阶级之敌，劳动人民之敌和科学之敌。为了中国六亿人民的利益，为了全世界的无产阶级的利益，为了保卫社会主义制度，我们必须高举马克思列宁主义理论的旗帜，对于垄断资本巨头的经济学，特别是要对凯恩斯的学说，包括它的基本概念和分析方法，进行彻底的批判；要对陈振汉及其追随者徐毓枬等所提出的反社会主义的经济纲领，进行彻底的批判。
