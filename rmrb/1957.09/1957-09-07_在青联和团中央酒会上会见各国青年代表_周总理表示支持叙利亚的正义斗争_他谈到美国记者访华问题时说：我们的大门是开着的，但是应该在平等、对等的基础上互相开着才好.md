Xinhua News Agency, 6th Dispatch: The All-China Youth Federation and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China held a reception at the Overseas Chinese Hotel tonight to welcome 111 youth representatives from 25 countries visiting China.

    Premier Zhou Enlai attended the reception. As he entered the dining hall, youth representatives from various countries cheered enthusiastically and surrounded him, asking him to sign autographs.

    Premier Zhou Enlai raised his glass and proposed: "Let us all toast to the great unity of the people of the world, to the great unity of the youth of the world, to world peace, and to the health and happiness of young friends from all countries."

    Premier Zhou Enlai walked through the hall and met with youth representatives from various countries. He said to the Syrian youth representatives: "You are fighting on the front lines of anti-colonialism, and peace-loving people all over the world are standing behind you. The Chinese people respect you very much and support you." The Syrian youth representative, Kadug, said to Premier Zhou Enlai: "We are also very grateful for your support, and we want to unite with you." Premier Zhou said: "We respect you, and we cherish your ancient culture; we want to unite on a new basis—the spirit of the Bandung Conference." The Syrian youth representatives also presented gifts to Premier Zhou Enlai.

    Premier Zhou Enlai took photos with youth representatives from Syria, Lebanon, Morocco, Sudan, West Africa, and Equatorial Africa.

    Premier Zhou Enlai spoke with youth representatives from Southeast Asian countries. He told the Indian youth representatives that he had fond memories of his visit to India. The Indian youth representatives shouted to him: "Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai!" He also told the Burmese representatives that he had visited Burma more than any other country in recent years. He said that China and Burma are like relatives. When he met with the Indonesian youth representatives, one representative affectionately kissed him. The Nepalese youth representatives came over to toast him, and he warmly congratulated the friendship between China and Nepal. Then, he toasted the Vietnamese and Ceylonese youth representatives. He also told the Thai youth representatives: A country can only develop by relying on its own people, and it must constantly overcome difficulties and move forward.

    When Premier Zhou Enlai spoke with an American young female representative about the friendly relations between the Chinese and American people, he said: "The Chinese people are willing to be friendly with the American people. I said these words two years ago at the Bandung Conference. Unfortunately, this voice cannot reach the ears of every American. But all the newspapers in China published these words." He hoped that the Chinese and American people could quickly establish friendship.

    An American youth representative asked Premier Zhou Enlai about the issue of American journalists visiting China. Premier Zhou Enlai said: "Our door is open, but it should be opened mutually on the basis of equality and reciprocity. The people are unwilling to cut off their exchanges." He said to the American youth representatives, "You are representatives of the friendly American people. I represent the Chinese people and hope to extend my greetings to the American people, especially the American youth, through you."

    When Premier Zhou Enlai spoke with the West German youth representatives, he told the West German guests that regardless of how different the social systems of various countries are, they should cooperate friendly and coexist peacefully. He also hoped that China and West Germany could cooperate friendly.

    At the meeting, youth representatives from Mexico, Guatemala, Cuba, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Uruguay raised their glasses together and said to Premier Zhou Enlai: "For the friendship between Latin American countries and China, let us toast." Premier Zhou Enlai said to them that Latin America has a bright future. He blessed the people of Latin American countries. He also said that the friendly relations between China and all Latin American countries will develop increasingly, and now we should strengthen mutual exchanges. Premier Zhou Enlai also asked the Spanish youth representatives to convey the Chinese people's respect to the hardworking and enthusiastic Spanish people.

Among them were: Vice Premier of the State Council He Long, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Guo Moruo, heads of various people's organizations, and well-known figures in the literary and artistic circles and religious circles.
