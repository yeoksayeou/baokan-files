Xinhua News Agency, September 11th: Wang Lanxi, head of the People's Republic of China Film Workers Delegation, sent a telegram to the Italian Venice Film Festival Committee yesterday, protesting the Italian authorities' rejection of Chinese films from participating in the film festival.

　　Wang Lanxi said in the telegram: "We were preparing to participate in the 18th Venice Film Festival upon your invitation when we learned that, due to external pressure, the relevant Italian authorities will refuse the participation of Chinese films. We are deeply regretful and protest against this extremely unfriendly attitude. This practice by the Italian authorities not only damages the friendship between the Chinese and Italian people, but also damages the reputation of the Venice Film Festival. I am also responsible for declaring the withdrawal of the films that have already been sent."

    据新华社11日讯  中华人民共和国电影工作者代表团团长王阑西昨天打电报给意大利威尼斯电影节委员会，对意大利当局拒绝我国影片参加电影节表示抗议。
    王阑西在这个电报中说：“我们应你会邀请正准备参加第十八届威尼斯电影节之际，得悉由于外来的压力，意大利有关当局将拒绝我国影片参加。对于这种极不友好的态度，我们甚感遗憾，并提出抗议。意大利当局这种做法，不特有损于中意两国人民之间的友谊，而且对于威尼斯电影节的信誉也是一种损害，我并负责声明撤回已经寄出的影片。”
