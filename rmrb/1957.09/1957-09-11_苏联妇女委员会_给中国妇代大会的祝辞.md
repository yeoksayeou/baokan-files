Soviet Women's Committee
　　Greetings to the Chinese Women's Congress
　　Dear Sisters:
    The Soviet Women's Committee, on behalf of all Soviet women, extends its heartfelt respects to the participants of the Third National Congress of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and through them, to all the women of the People's Republic of China.
    Soviet women, like all Soviet people, harbor the most sincere friendship for the Chinese people and our Chinese girlfriends. We are overjoyed by the great achievements made by our Chinese friends.
    The women of the People's Republic of China are the fully entitled masters of their homeland. They participate in all aspects of life alongside men and demonstrate a vast and creative force in the socialist construction of their country.
    The All-China Democratic Women's Federation is one of the most active members of the Women's International Democratic Federation, and it has made enormous contributions to defending peace, striving for women's rights, and safeguarding the well-being of children.
    We sincerely wish you, dear sisters, renewed achievements in your multifaceted activities.
    May the friendship between Chinese and Soviet women further develop and consolidate.
            Soviet Women's Committee

　　亲爱的姊妹们：
    苏联妇女委员会代表全体苏联妇女向中华全国民主妇女联合会第三次代表大会的参加者并通过她们向中华人民共和国的全体妇女致以衷心的敬意。
    苏联妇女和全体苏联人民一样，对于中国人民及自己的中国女朋友怀着最诚挚的友情。我们为中国朋友所获得的巨大的成就而欢欣鼓舞。
    中华人民共和国的妇女是自己祖国有充分权利的主人。她们和男人一道参加各项生活，并在本国的社会主义建设中表现为一支庞大的具有创造性的力量。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会是国际民主妇联最积极的成员之一，它在保卫和平、争取妇女权利、维护儿童幸福方面做出了巨大的贡献。
    我们衷心地预祝你们，亲爱的姊妹们，在你们多方面的活动中获得更新的成就。
    让中国妇女和苏联妇女之间的友谊更加发展和巩固。
