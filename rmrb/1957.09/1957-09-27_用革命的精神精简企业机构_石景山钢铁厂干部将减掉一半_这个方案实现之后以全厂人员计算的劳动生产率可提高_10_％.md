Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Today, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant proposed a revolutionary plan for running a socialist enterprise: to streamline the existing 1,975 cadres to 896, a reduction of 1,079 people, accounting for 55% of the original cadre force.

After the implementation of this plan, the ratio of cadres to the total number of employees will decrease from 17.4% to 8.58%. This ratio is significantly lower than the ratio of cadres to the total number of employees in enterprises under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, which is 15% (end of 1956 figures).

In addition, the factory also plans to transfer residential housing and cultural welfare facilities such as employee schools to relevant government departments for management. If this plan is realized, it can further reduce the number of cadres by 156, reducing the ratio of cadres to the total number of employees to 7.49%.

This business reform is a major gain from the rectification movement. After the implementation of this plan, labor productivity calculated by the total number of employees can be increased by 10%.

Due to the reduction of more than 1,000 cadres, the annual reduction in wages and office expenses will total 1.38 million yuan. The streamlined cadres can also participate in industrial and agricultural labor, creating wealth for the country, or supporting the country's construction.

According to the new reform plan, the number of cadres is reduced, the organization is smaller, but the management of production is strengthened.

The streamlining of each person or organization in this factory is based on the principle of improving enterprise management level and promoting production development, starting from the actual situation and not being limited by books. Some organizational structures and systems that are considered scientific in books have also been reformed according to the actual situation of the factory. Therefore, this reform is a major revolution in the management of socialist enterprises. In this reform, the number of cadres in sections and offices is generally reduced more, by 57.74%; the number of cadres in workshops is reduced less, by 48.58%; the number of management personnel is reduced more, by 62.75%; the number of production and technical personnel is reduced less, by 32.39%.

There are three methods of streamlining:

First, merge institutions and change the situation of excessive division of labor, merging 31 sections and directly subordinate factory department divisions and teams into 20 units. For example, the finance section and the accounting section are merged, the office and the secretary's office are merged; the technical education section, the health section, and the supervision office are abolished, and their business is assigned to relevant sections. In addition, 17 workshops and directly subordinate factory divisions and teams are merged into 10 units. For example, the coking, coal washing, and chemical workshops are merged, and the thermal power workshop and the water supply workshop are merged, and so on.

Second, organize professional collaboration and eliminate all redundant and unnecessary work. Many sections have professional staff divided according to workshops, and each workshop has its own professional functional team, so the professional staff of each section divided according to workshops can be eliminated.

Third, improve business and improve efficiency, and promote one person or one institution to master multiple skills; to undertake a variety of different and greater tasks with fewer people and smaller institutions. At the same time, when determining the staffing of each unit, leading cadres are arranged to carry out certain major specific tasks. For example, the head of the finished products section concurrently manages sales plans, and the head of the administrative section concurrently manages confidential work, in order to overcome the shortcomings of having too many "principle cadres."

This business reform is mainly due to the overly complex organizational structure, overstaffing, and unreasonable management system. Due to the excessive division of labor, the phenomenon of work duplication often occurs. The factory's material accounts are kept separately by the finance section, the supply section, and the accounting section. The packaging of ferromanganese also requires the simultaneous supervision of three units. Delays and wrangling often occur in the work. Once, the Tangshan Steel Plant sent a letter to the factory requesting the payment of wages for apprentices, which resulted in six sections transmitting the letter back and forth seven times, and six sections signed and annotated their opinions five times, taking two months to remit the money.

The reasons for the large organizational structure and certain unreasonable systems are, on the one hand, insufficient implementation of the policy of diligence and thrift in running enterprises, such as setting up long-term staffing based on temporary work arrangements; on the other hand, the transformation from old enterprises to new socialist enterprises means that all cadres lack experience and are learning while doing. Therefore, every time a new business is established, a group of specialized institutions are added, and more cadres are assigned in order to quickly learn and establish the new business. For example, the establishment of planning management has added a group of planning, statistics, and scheduling personnel; strengthening technical management has added a group of technical, equipment, and supervision personnel. This was necessary at the time. However, now the business level of the employees and the management level of the enterprises have improved, and the experience of leading cadres in managing enterprises has also increased over the years, and they have become able to master multiple skills and undertake more work. At the same time, due to the improvement of the political consciousness of the workers and the development of the habit of complying with various operating procedures, the enterprise is also easier to manage. Therefore, the conditions for further reforming business and raising enterprise management to a new level are ripe.

A small number of the streamlined cadres will be sent to strengthen grassroots work; more than 100 cadres will return to production posts as workers and participate in labor; more than 500 cadres will participate in the factory's expansion work, working as apprentices to learn construction technology, or learning steelmaking, rolling, and other technologies, and will become technical workers, technicians, and management personnel in the new workshops in the future.

This business reform plan was announced by factory director Zhou Guanwu at the employee representative conference held today. The employee representatives discussed this plan, and many representatives requested that the leadership thoroughly reform the factory's enterprise management in accordance with this plan.

    用革命的精神精简企业机构
    石景山钢铁厂干部将减掉一半
    这个方案实现之后以全厂人员计算的劳动生产率可提高10％
    新华社26日讯　今天，石景山钢铁厂提出了办好社会主义企业的一个革命性的方案：把现有的一千九百七十五个干部精简到八百九十六人，减少了一千零七十九人，占原有干部的55％。
    实现这个方案以后，干部同职工总数的比例将由17.4％降为8.58％。这个比例大大低于冶金工业部所属企业的干部同职工总数的比例；冶金工业部所属企业在这方面的比例是15％（1956年年底数字）。
    另外，这个厂还准备把住宅和职工学校等文化福利事业，争取交给政府有关部门管理。如果这个计划实现，还可再减少干部一百五十六人，把干部占职工总数的比例降为7.49％。
    这次业务改革是整风的一个主要收获。实现这个方案以后，以全厂人员计算的劳动生产率可以提高10％。
    由于减少一千多名干部，每年少开支的工资和办公费用等共一百三十八万元。精简下来的干部还可以参加工农业劳动，为国家创造财富，或支援国家的建设事业。
    按照新的改革方案，干部少了，机构小了，但对生产的管理却加强了。
    这个厂每一个人员或机构的精简，都以提高企业管理水平、促进生产发展为原则，从实际情况出发，不受书本子的限制。有些书本上认为是科学的组织机构和制度，也根据工厂的实际情况改革了。因此，这次改革是社会主义企业管理工作的一个很大的革命。这次改革一般是科室干部减得多，减57.74％；车间干部减得少，减48.58％；管理人员减得多，减62.75％；生产技术人员减得少，减32.39％。
    精简的方法有三个：
    一，合并机构，改变分工过细的状况，把三十一个科室和直属厂部的股、队合并成二十个单位。如财务科同会计科合并，办公室同秘书室合并；取消技术教育科、卫生科、监察室等，将其业务划归有关的科室。另外，把十七个车间和直属厂部的股和队合并成十个单位。如炼焦、洗煤、化工三个车间合并，热力车间同供水车间合并，等等。
  二，组织专业协作，把重复的和不必要的工作一律取消。很多科室都有按车间分工的专业员，而各车间又有本车间的专业职能组，因此各科室按车间分工的专业员就可以取消。
    三，改进业务，提高效率，提倡一人或一个机构掌握多种技能；以人少、机构小来担负起多种不同的和更大的任务。同时，在确定每一个单位的编制时，都对领导干部安排一定的主要的具体工作。如成品科长兼管销售计划，行政科长兼管机要工作，以克服“原则干部”多的缺点。
    这次业务改革，主要是因为组织机构过于庞杂，人浮于事，有些管理制度不合理。由于分工过细，经常发生工作重复的现象。工厂的材料账，财务科、供应科和会计科也都各有一套。锰铁包装工作也要三个单位同时监督。工作中拖拉扯皮的事情常常发生。有一次唐山钢厂给这个厂来信要代培徒工的工资，结果由六个科室往返传递七次，六个科室分别签注了五次意见，历时两个月才把钱汇走。
    组织机构庞大和某些制度不合理的原因，一方面是贯彻勤俭办企业的方针不够，如根据一时的工作安排长期的编制；另一方面，从旧企业改变为社会主义新企业，所有的干部都缺乏经验，都是在边学边做。因此，每建设一项新的业务，就增设一批专业机构，配备较多的干部，以便迅速地学会和建立起新的业务。例如，建立计划管理，就增添了一批计划、统计和调度人员；加强技术管理，就增添了一批技术、设备和监督人员。这在当时是必要的。但是现在职工们的业务水平和企业的管理水平提高了，几年来领导干部管理企业的经验也增加了，他们已经有可能掌握多种技能和担负更多的工作。同时，由于工人的政治觉悟的提高和养成了遵守各种操作规程的习惯，企业也更加好管理了。因此，进一步改革业务，使企业管理提高到新的水平的条件就成熟了。
    精简下来的干部，有少部分将下放加强基层工作；有一百多个干部将回到生产岗位当工人，参加劳动；有五百多个干部将参加本厂的扩建工作，当徒工学施工技术，或者学习炼钢、轧钢等技术，将来在新车间当技术工人、技术人员和管理人员。
    这个业务改革方案是厂长周冠五在今天举行的职工代表大会上宣布的。职工代表们讨论了这个方案，很多代表要求领导方面应按照这个方案彻底改革本厂的企业管理。
