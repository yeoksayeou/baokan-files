Opening Speech
    Cai Chang
    Dear Representatives:
    The Third National Women's Congress of China is now open!
    More than four years have passed since the Second National Women's Congress of China. This is a great historical period. For many years, the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have struggled hard, and the socialist system pursued by countless martyrs who shed their blood and sacrificed themselves has finally been realized in this period.
    During this period, due to the victory of the socialist revolution led by the Party and the rapid development of socialist construction, the poor and backward motherland that the Chinese people took over from the enemy is undergoing rapid changes. Brilliant achievements have been made in the construction of politics, economy, culture, and other aspects.
    It is precisely because the Party led the Chinese people to realize the socialist revolution, and at the same time implemented the principle of mobilizing both men and women in all aspects, that Chinese women not only enjoy equal rights with men in political, economic, cultural, social, and family life, but also greatly improved women's enthusiasm for loving the motherland, loving labor, and loving socialism, giving full play to their intelligence and talents, and making great contributions to the motherland.
    The agenda of our congress is: to summarize the work of the past four years and determine the tasks of women's work in the future; to revise the constitution of our Women's Federation based on the new situation and work experience; and to elect the third executive committee of the Women's Federation.
    The main task of our congress is to further unite and mobilize women across the country to fight for the construction of a socialist motherland. In order to build socialism, the Chinese Communist Party has put forward the basic policy of building the country and managing households with diligence and thrift to the people of the whole country. Of course, our women have the responsibility for building the country with diligence and thrift, and women have a special responsibility for managing households with diligence and thrift, because women are mainly in charge of household affairs. Chairman Mao said: To realize managing households with diligence and thrift, we must especially rely on women's organizations to do the work. This is precisely because women are the masters of household affairs. In order to ensure the victory of the socialist revolution and consolidate the achievements of the revolution, Chairman Mao published "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," calling on the people of the whole country to correct their political direction and resolutely take the socialist road. Now the people of the whole country are engaged in the anti-Rightist struggle and the great debate on the two roads. This is a great socialist revolution in politics and ideology, which must be carried out to the end. We will never stop fighting until we win a complete victory. Therefore, our congress is to seriously and deeply discuss the national policy of building the country and managing households with diligence and thrift; to seriously and deeply launch a great debate on the two roads, criticize bourgeois ideology, and powerfully expose all the conspiracies of the Rightists to oppose the Communist Party, oppose the people, and oppose the socialist system, thereby raising our socialist awareness. We want to make this congress a mobilization meeting for women across the country to resolutely practice building the country and managing households with diligence and thrift during the socialist construction period of the motherland, and we want to make this congress a battle meeting against the Rightists.
    Dear comrades, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have always led and supported our women's liberation cause. Today, members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, secretaries of the Secretariat, the Premier of the State Council, Vice Premiers, and representatives of various democratic parties and non-party figures are present at our congress; on behalf of the congress, I extend to them, and through them, to our most beloved Chairman Mao, the beloved Chinese Communist Party, and the people's beloved government, the warmest and most solemn respect. People's organizations and relevant departments have always cooperated with us to carry out women's work and serve the masses of women. On behalf of the congress, I express my heartfelt thanks to them.
    Today, we are joined by the shining examples of our women—representatives of Soviet women, representatives of women from various socialist countries; Miss Pushpamoye Bose, Vice-Chairman of the Women's International Democratic Federation, Mrs. Ramishiwari Nehru, Chairman of the Asian Solidarity Committee who is visiting Beijing; and the wives of diplomatic envoys stationed in Beijing; we warmly welcome them. Their presence is a great encouragement and support to us; it gives us the opportunity to learn from them; it enables us to further develop friendship with each other, strengthen unity with each other, thereby helping to further strengthen the close unity and cooperation of women in socialist countries led by the Soviet Union, and strengthen the great unity of women in all countries around the world in the cause of defending peace, defending women's rights, and defending children.
    The representatives attending this congress include representative figures from various regions of the country, from fraternal ethnic groups, from various production fronts, from various work positions, and from various different families. There are also women representatives from overseas. Everyone is gathered together with excitement and joy to discuss issues related to our women's struggle to build a socialist motherland. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the joint efforts of all representatives, we will be able to successfully complete the tasks of this congress and make this congress a new milestone on the road forward for the women's movement in our country. Finally, let us shout:
    Women of all China unite and fight for the construction of a socialist motherland!
    Women of the world unite and fight for world peace and human progress!

    Women Must Resolutely Pass the Socialism Test
    Honorary Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation Soong Ching Ling
    To the Presidium of the Third National Women's Congress of China, and to all the representatives:
    Please accept my heartfelt congratulations on the opening of the Third National Women's Congress of China!
    This National Women's Congress is being held at a time when our country is launching a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. This revolution involves everyone in the country, and everyone must pass the socialism test. To pass the socialism test, first of all, we must have a clear-cut stand. We women have the deepest hatred for the old society, and the deepest love for the Communist Party and the socialist system. Because of their personal experience, women should have a clear-cut stand on who to love and who to hate, what to support and what to oppose in the struggle between socialism and capitalism. The bourgeois Rightists are frantically attacking the Party, the people, and socialism. They are trying to overthrow the leadership of the Party, trying to restore capitalism, and trying to put the shackles that were just thrown off not long ago back on women. Therefore, we must overcome sentimentalism and thoroughly crush the bourgeois Rightists; we must resolutely follow the Communist Party on the socialist road. There is no middle road here!
    To pass the socialism test also requires us to constantly improve our socialist awareness, overcome the shortcomings and weaknesses left over from the old society, actively participate in labor production, and make greater contributions to the cause of socialist construction in the motherland. Building a socialist society in our vast country requires the long-term hard work of hundreds of millions of people. Whether in industrial and agricultural production or in administrative, cultural, and educational undertakings, women are an indispensable labor force, and women's labor in managing households and raising children is especially admirable and valuable. Therefore, we are required to work selflessly for the socialist construction of the country, for the harmonious life of the family, and for the happiness of our children and grandchildren in the spirit of building the country and managing households with diligence and thrift!
    In the past revolutionary struggles and in labor production, Chinese women have always advanced side by side with men. I believe that in the current socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, in the severe test of passing the socialism test, they will also resolutely and confidently devote themselves to this great struggle and achieve victory!
    I wish the congress success, and I wish all the sisters good health!

    Expectations for Chinese Women
    Honorary Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation He Xiangning
    Dear sisters:
    The Third National Women's Congress of China has opened. Women representatives from all provinces, autonomous regions, cities, and industries across the country, as well as women representatives from Hong Kong and Macao, and overseas Chinese women representatives are all gathered together. This congress is a congress of unity, and also a congress for exchanging experiences and learning from each other. I wish this congress victory and success! Today, representatives from the International Women's Federation and women representatives from various countries have come from afar to attend our congress. Here, I would like to express my warm welcome to them, and I hope that in the future, women all over the world will further unite in friendship, work together, strive for world peace, and protect the happiness of children!
    In the past seven or eight years, under the united guidance of the All-China Women's Federation, Chinese women have done a lot of work in industry, agriculture, transportation, handicrafts, side occupations, social welfare, science and art, culture, education, and health, and have contributed a lot of strength to socialist construction. Today's construction achievements are the result of the joint labor of the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, which also includes the labor achievements of Chinese women. We cherish it very much.
    Personally, I feel that we women account for more than half of the country's population, and Chinese women should do more and better work than they are doing now. I have very high expectations for sisters across the country. I hope that in the future, sisters across the country will make more and better achievements in various positions. I think that doing a good job in industrial, agricultural, handicraft, and sideline production, as well as social welfare, science and art, culture, education, health, and childcare, are all important links in socialist construction. Women's active participation in production and construction is not only beneficial to the country and society, but also beneficial to individuals and to future generations. I believe that Chinese women, who have good traditions such as diligence, wisdom, hard work, and thrift, will continue to unite with the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government in the future, to defend world peace, defend the people's democratic dictatorship, defend the socialist cause, fight the bourgeois Rightists to the end, and continue to tap potential in various tasks, give full play to their initiative and creativity, work together, work hard, work diligently, earnestly implement the policy of managing households with diligence and thrift and building the country with diligence and thrift, and work together with the people of the whole country to strive to over fulfill the first five-year plan and gradually turn the dilapidated and backward old China into an advanced, prosperous, and strong new China.
    I am already eighty years old. As a woman who spans different eras, comparing the humiliation and pain I personally experienced before liberation with the happiness and joy that Chinese women universally enjoy after liberation, I feel that there is a world of difference. I said as early as more than thirty years ago: "There are two shackles binding Chinese women: one is the aggression and oppression of imperialist politics and economy; the other is the shackles of feudalism. Under these two shackles, Chinese women cannot be independent or autonomous. Only revolution is the way out for Chinese women." I believe that all sisters also deeply know the various humiliations and pains that Chinese women have suffered for a long time, and also know that only by overthrowing imperialism and feudalism, and only by carrying out revolution, can we Chinese women have a way out. Recently, the Rightists have been frantically attacking the Communist Party and socialism, attempting to usurp leadership. We must resolutely fight against the Rightists. The Rightists are bent on pulling us back to the old road, bent on surrendering to imperialism, and bent on restoring capitalism, so that our China cannot be independent and autonomous, so that our various production and construction undertakings will be backward and regressive, so that our China will once again fall into the tragic situation of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism, so that our people will live the same hard days as before liberation, and so that our women will lose the happiness they have just gained. We are resolutely unable to agree to this.
    Only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, by taking the socialist road, can our country have a future, can our production and construction be prosperous and affluent, and can we and our descendants have happiness. We must unite together to resolutely support socialism and resolutely fight the Rightists to the end.

    Vice Chairman of the CPPCC Guo Moruo's Speech
    Chairman, fellow representatives:
    Today, the Third National Women's Congress of China opens. On behalf of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, I extend warm congratulations to the congress and wish the congress success!
    In the past few years, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of our country have achieved particularly brilliant and epoch-making results on the economic front. Through peaceful methods, we have basically completed the extremely complex and difficult historical task of changing the private ownership of the means of production into socialist public ownership, and established socialist relations of production. At the same time, our country's socialist construction has also made considerable progress.
    There is no doubt that in the cause of socialist transformation and socialist construction of the motherland, the broad masses of women compatriots of all nationalities and all classes in our country have made unprecedented outstanding contributions. Whether in industry, agriculture, handicrafts, cultural education, science and technology, or in various aspects of state power, women in our country have demonstrated unparalleled talents and wisdom. The status of women in our country has also undergone a fundamental change for the first time in history. In the political, economic, cultural, social, and family life, they have enjoyed equal rights with men. This fully proves that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can women, who have been oppressed and enslaved for a long time, be liberated along with the liberation of the people of the whole country. The Communist Party is the core of leadership and the liberator of the people of the whole country. Only by following the Communist Party on the socialist road can the Chinese people, regardless of gender, seek their complete liberation and further promote the happiness of all mankind.
    The resolution of the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party on the political report pointed out that our current main task is to concentrate our efforts to quickly transform the backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country. This is a very arduous task. In order to complete this task, we must unanimously abide by Chairman Mao's instruction of "building the country with diligence and thrift" and strive to implement it. Women compatriots of all nationalities and all classes in our country must, with the attitude of masters, actively and selflessly labor on various production fronts and work positions, make persistent efforts, practice economy, strive to increase production, and contribute greater strength to a better future for the motherland.
    Since the family is a component unit of society, managing households with diligence and thrift is of great significance for implementing the policy of "building the country with diligence and thrift." A happy family is built on the basis of diligence and thrift; to build a prosperous, strong, and happy socialist country, it is especially necessary to rely on increasing production and practicing economy to accumulate for socialist construction. On this point, women especially shoulder a more important responsibility than men. Therefore, we earnestly hope that women compatriots across the country will, together with the people of the whole country, adhere to opposing the decadent lifestyle of the bourgeoisie, promote our country's excellent tradition of diligence and thrift, establish a new moral style of hard work and simplicity, and better serve socialist construction.
    Fellow representatives, you must have realized that under the leadership of the Party, the socialist economic foundation of our country has basically been laid, but the socialist superstructure remains to be constructed by us. That is to say, we are still far behind in reality in terms of ideology and thought. To this end, the Party has launched a rectification movement in order to carry out socialist construction faster and better. However, the bourgeois Rightists and other anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist elements have taken advantage of the opportunity of the Party's rectification movement to frantically launch an attack on the Party from all aspects of urban and rural areas, attempting to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system and restore the bourgeoisie. This is absolutely intolerable to the people of our country and the broad masses of women. Under the leadership of the Party, the whole country has launched a nationwide debate to give these reactionary elements a comprehensive and resolute counterattack. We must distinguish between right and wrong and firmly support the leadership of the Party and take the socialist road. Therefore, the current anti-Rightist struggle is precisely a socialist revolution in ideology. After winning the victory on the economic front, we must achieve the same victory in politics and ideology. We must thoroughly overcome bourgeois and other backward ideas in order to achieve a complete victory in the socialist revolution. Only in this way can our people's democratic dictatorship be consolidated and our socialist construction be developed more smoothly. Therefore, the present is an important juncture. Each of us must stand firm, draw a clear line between our thinking and that of the Rightists, and pass the great test of socialism.
    Fellow representatives, this congress is convened during the high tide of the counterattack against the Rightists, which adds a serious task to the congress. We hope that the congress will carry out great airing, great blooming, and great debate under the banner of socialism, actively participate in the struggle against the bourgeois Rightists, and launch socialist ideological education on a national scale, so that this education penetrates into every aspect of society and into everyone's heart.
    Marxism-Leninism is bound to overcome everything!
    Please let us always unite closely around the Party, give full play to all our strength, overcome all obstacles, and strive for the complete victory of the socialist revolution.

    Vice-Chairman of the Women's International Democratic Federation
    Speech by Miss Pushpamoye Bose
    Chairman, dear friends:
    On the occasion of the Third National Women's Congress of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, I am very grateful to have this good opportunity to come here on behalf of the Women's International Democratic Federation to extend my congratulations to you.
    The Women's International Democratic Federation extends its warmest congratulations to all of you and sincerely wishes the congress success.
    Women all over the world are following your progress with great interest and great admiration.
    China has created a miracle in the past few years, liberating hundreds of millions of Chinese women from bondage and suffering and the scourge of colonialism. Your remarkable achievements in improving the lives of women and children in such a short period of time have been hailed as an outstanding achievement in the women's movement worldwide.
    The convening of the congress at such an important juncture in the development of world history today is of particular significance. The whole world is being shaken by a fervor never seen before. Your resolutions will bring new light to the efforts of women around the world to achieve lasting peace. Your resolutions will further advance the movement of women in developing countries to fight for their own rights, the rights of children, and the national independence of those countries that are still occupied by colonialism—especially in Asia and Africa.
    You Chinese sisters, after countless pains and sacrifices suffered during the struggle for liberation, have become loyal fighters for peace. Your country has brought to the world the message of coexistence, which is the primary and ultimate goal of lasting world peace and friendship. Your congress will strengthen the power of women around the world to continue their work for peace and unity.
    The Women's International Democratic Federation represents the cause of women; it is a fighter for peace. The primary task before us is to raise the voice of peace to oppose forces that not only seek to destroy peace but also attempt to destroy the entire world. Only in a peaceful society can women grow and gain their rightful place, and create happy and peaceful families for their children.
    The upcoming Fourth World Women's Congress of the Women's International Democratic Federation will be a very important congress from all aspects of the cause of women and children.
    Your congress is a significant contribution to the Fourth World Women's Congress, bringing new glory to the further unity and cooperation, and the progress of the common program of striving for women's rights, children's happiness and peace work. We hail the congress, we congratulate all of you, you Chinese sisters, under the slogan of unity, unification and fraternity.

    在中国妇女第三次全国代表大会上
    开幕词
    蔡畅
    亲爱的代表们：
    中国妇女第三次全国代表大会现在开幕了！
    从中国妇女第二次全国代表大会到这次大会，已经四年多了。这是一个伟大的历史时期。多少年来，全国人民在中国共产党领导之下，坚苦奋斗，无数先烈流血牺牲所追求的社会主义制度，终于在这个时期实现了。
    在这时期，由于党领导的社会主义革命的胜利和社会主义建设的迅速发展，中国人民从敌人手里接过来的贫困而落后的祖国，正在日新月异地变化着，政治、经济、文化等各方面的建设，都取得了辉煌的成就。
    正由于党领导中国人民实现了社会主义革命，同时又在各个方面贯彻了男女一齐发动的方针。中国妇女不仅在政治的、经济的、文化的、社会的、家庭的生活各方面，享有同男子平等的权利，而且大大提高了妇女热爱祖国、热爱劳动、热爱社会主义的积极性，发挥了聪明才智，对祖国作出了巨大的贡献。
    我们这次大会的议程是：总结四年来的工作，确定今后妇女工作的任务；根据新的形势和工作经验，修改我们妇联的章程；选举第三届妇联执行委员会。
    我们这次大会的主要任务，就是要进一步团结和动员全国妇女为建设社会主义祖国而奋斗。为了建成社会主义，中国共产党向全国人民提出了勤俭建国、勤俭持家的基本方针。对勤俭建国，我们妇女当然有责任，对勤俭持家，妇女更有着特殊的责任，因为主持家务的，主要是妇女。毛主席说：要实现勤俭持家，特别要依靠妇女团体来做工作。这正是因为妇女群众是家务主持者的原故。为了保证社会主义革命的胜利，巩固革命的成果，毛主席发表了“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”，号召全国人民端正政治方向、坚决走社会主义道路。现在全国人民正在紧张地进行反右派斗争和展开两条道路的大辩论，这是政治上、思想上的伟大的社会主义革命，必须进行到底的，不获全胜，决不收兵。因此，我们的大会，就是要认真地、深刻地讨论勤俭建国、勤俭持家的建国方针；就是要认真地、深刻地展开两条道路的大辩论，批判资产阶级思想，有力地揭穿右派分子反共反人民反社会主义制度的一切阴谋，从而提高我们的社会主义觉悟。我们要使这次大会，成为祖国社会主义建设时期，全国妇女一致厉行勤俭建国、勤俭持家的动员大会，我们要使这次大会成为反右派的战斗大会。
    亲爱的同志们，中国共产党、人民政府一贯领导和支持我们妇女解放事业，今天中共中央政治局委员、书记处书记、国务院总理、副总理和各民主党派、无党派人士的代表，光临我们的大会；我代表大会向他们、并且通过他们向我们最敬爱的毛主席、亲爱的中国共产党、人民热爱的政府致以最热烈的、最崇高的敬礼。各人民团体、有关的各部门，一贯和我们相互配合，进行妇女工作，为妇女群众服务。我代表大会向他们表示衷心感谢。
    今天和我们在一起的，有我们妇女的光辉榜样——苏联妇女的代表，有各社会主义国家妇女的代表；有国际民主妇女联合会的副主席普什帕莫耶·鲍斯小姐，有正在北京访问的亚洲团结委员会的主席拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人；还有驻北京的各国使节夫人们；我们热烈地欢迎她们。她们的光临对我们是一个很大的鼓舞和支持；使我们有机会向她们学习；使我们能更加发展相互之间的友谊，加强相互之间的团结，从而有助于进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义各国妇女的亲密团结和合作，加强全世界各国妇女在保卫和平、保卫妇女权利、保卫儿童的事业中的大团结。
    出席这次大会的代表，有从国内各个地区来的、有从兄弟民族来的各种生产战线上、各种工作岗位上和各种不同的家庭里的代表性人物。有从海外来的妇女代表人物。大家都带着兴奋、愉快的心情团聚在一起，讨论有关我们妇女为建设社会主义祖国而奋斗的问题。我们深信，在中国共产党的领导下，在全体代表的共同努力下，我们将能圆满地完成这次大会的任务，使这次大会成为我国妇女运动前进道路上新的里程碑。最后，让我们高呼：
    全中国妇女团结起来，为建设社会主义的祖国而奋斗！
    全世界妇女团结起来，为世界和平、人类进步而奋斗！
    妇女要坚决过社会主义这一关
    中华全国民主妇女联合会名誉主席　宋庆龄
    中国妇女第三次全国代表大会主席团转全体代表们：
    当中国妇女第三次全国代表大会开幕之际，请接受我的衷心的祝贺！
    这次全国妇女代表大会开会的时候，正值我国展开政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命。这一场革命涉及到全国每一个人，每一个人都要过社会主义这一关。过社会主义这一关，首先要求我们要有鲜明的立场。我们妇女对旧社会的仇恨最深，对共产党和社会主义制度的热爱也最深。妇女们由于切身的体验，在社会主义和资本主义这两条道路的斗争中爱谁、恨谁，拥护什么、反对什么，应该是立场鲜明的。资产阶级右派分子向党、向人民、向社会主义猖狂进攻，他们企图推翻党的领导，企图让资本主义复辟，也就是企图把不久之前才摆脱掉的、带了几千年的枷锁重新加在妇女们的身上。因此，我们必须克服温情主义，彻底粉碎资产阶级右派；必须坚决跟着共产党走社会主义道路。这里中间路线是没有的！
    过社会主义这一关，也就是要求我们不断提高社会主义觉悟，克服旧社会遗留在我们身上的缺点和弱点，积极参加劳动生产，在祖国社会主义建设事业中作出更大的贡献。在我们广阔的国土上建设社会主义社会，需要千百万人民长期的辛勤劳动。无论在工农业生产方面，在行政和文教事业方面，妇女都是不可缺少的劳动大军，而在持家和教养子女方面，妇女的劳动尤其可敬可贵。因此，就要求我们本着勤俭建国、勤俭持家的精神，为国家的社会主义建设，为家庭的和睦生活，为儿孙辈的幸福忘我地劳动！
    中国妇女在过去的革命斗争中和在劳动生产中，一向是和男子并肩前进的。我相信在当前的政治战线和思想战线的社会主义革命中，在过社会主义这一关的严重考验中，也一定会坚强地、信心百倍地投入这个伟大的斗争，并取得胜利！
    祝大会成功，祝姐妹们身体健康！
    对中国妇女的期望
    中华全国民主妇女联合会名誉主席　何香凝
    各位亲爱的姊妹们：
    中国妇女第三次全国代表大会开幕了，全国各省、自治区、市、各行业的妇女代表，港、澳妇女代表，华侨妇女代表都欢聚一堂。这次代表大会是团结的大会，也是交流经验、互相学习的大会。我预祝这次代表大会胜利、成功！今天国际妇联和各国妇女代表，也不远千里而来参加了我们这次代表大会，我在这里谨对她们表示热烈的欢迎，并希望今后全世界妇女更进一步友好团结，共同努力，争取世界和平，保卫儿童幸福！
    过去七、八年以来，中国妇女在全国妇联的团结指导之下，在工业、农业、交通运输业、手工业、副业和社会福利、科学艺术、文教卫生等等方面，都做了不少工作，对社会主义建设贡献了不少的力量。今天的建设成就，是全国人民在中国共产党和人民政府领导之下共同劳动的成果，其中也包含了中国妇女的劳动成果在内。我们十分珍贵它。
    我个人觉得，我们妇女占全国人口的一半以上，中国妇女在可能中应该做出比现在更多更好的工作。我对全国姊妹的期望十分殷切。我希望今后全国姊妹在各个不同岗位上会做出比现在更多更好的成就。我以为搞好工业、农业、手工业、副业生产，搞好社会福利、科学艺术、文教卫生及育儿等工作，都是社会主义建设中的重要环节。妇女积极参加生产建设，不独可以有利于国家，有利于社会，还有利于个人，有利于儿孙后代。我相信，有勤劳、智慧、刻苦、俭朴等优良传统的中国妇女，今后一定会继续在中国共产党和人民政府的领导之下，与全国人民团结一致，为保卫世界和平，保卫人民民主专政，保卫社会主义事业，与资产阶级右派分子斗争到底，并且继续在各项工作中发掘潜力，发挥积极性、创造性，共同努力，艰苦奋斗，辛勤劳动，认真执行勤俭持家，勤俭建国的方针，和全国人民一起，同心协力，争取超额完成第一个五年计划，逐步把残破落后的旧中国，变为先进富强的新中国。
    我已经有八十岁了。作为一个横跨不同时代的妇女，我将解放前亲身经历过的屈辱痛苦和解放后中国妇女普遍享受得到的快乐幸福相比，感到真有天渊之别。我早在三十多年前就已经说过：“羁缚在中国妇女身上的枷锁有两条：一是帝国主义政治经济的侵略、压迫；一是封建主义束缚。在这两重枷锁之下，中国妇女是不能独立、不能自主的。只有革命，才是中国妇女的出路。”相信各位姊妹也深知长久以来中国妇女所受的种种屈辱和痛苦，也知道只有打倒帝国主义和封建主义，只有进行革命，才有我们中国妇女的出路。最近右派分子猖狂向共产党、向社会主义进攻，妄图篡夺领导权。我们一定要坚决与右派分子斗争。右派分子一心想把我们拉回老路，一心想投降帝国主义，一心想恢复资本主义，使我们中国不能独立自主，使我们各项生产建设事业落后倒退，使我们中国重陷半封建半殖民地的悲惨境地，使我们全国人民过着解放以前一样的苦日子，使我们妇女重行失去那刚刚得到的幸福，我们是坚决不能答应的。
    只有在中国共产党的领导之下，走社会主义道路，我们的国家才有前途，我们的生产建设才能繁荣富足，我们和后代儿孙才有幸福。我们要共同起来坚决拥护社会主义，坚决和右派分子斗争到底。
    政协副主席郭沫若致词
    主席、各位代表：
    今天中国妇女第三次全国代表大会开幕，我代表中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会谨向大会致以热烈的祝贺，并祝大会成功！
    几年以来，我国人民在中国共产党正确领导下，已经在经济战线上取得了特别辉煌的划时代的成果。我们通过和平的方法，基本上完成了改变生产资料私有制为社会主义公有制这一极其复杂和困难的历史任务，确立了社会主义所有制的生产关系。同时，我国的社会主义建设事业也得到了长足的进展。
    毫无疑问，在祖国的社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业中，我国各民族各阶层的广大妇女同胞们，曾经做出了前所未有的卓越贡献。无论在工业、农业、手工业、文化教育、科学技术和国家政权各个方面，我国妇女都发挥了无比的才能和智慧。我国妇女的地位也在历史上第一次发生了根本的变化，在政治的、经济的、文化的、社会的和家庭生活的各个方面，都享受到了与男子平等的权利。这就充分证明，只有在中国共产党领导下，才能使长期被压迫被奴役的妇女随着全国人民的解放而得到解放。共产党是全国人民的领导核心和解放者。只有跟着共产党走社会主义的道路，中国人民不分男女性别，才能求得自己的彻底解放，并进一步促进全人类的幸福。
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会关于政治报告的决议中指出，我们当前的主要任务，就是集中力量尽速地把落后的农业国变为先进的工业国。这是一个十分艰巨的任务。为了完成这个任务，我们必须全国一致地遵守毛主席“勤俭建国”的指示，努力实行。我国各民族各阶层的妇女同胞们，在各个生产战线和工作岗位上，必须以主人翁的态度，积极忘我的劳动，再接再厉，厉行节约，努力增产，为祖国更好的将来贡献出更大的力量。
    由于家庭是社会的组成单位，因而勤俭持家对于贯彻“勤俭建国”的方针便具有重大的意义。幸福的家庭是在克勤克俭的基础之上建立起来的；要建成繁荣、富强、康乐的社会主义国家，尤必须依靠增产节约，以为社会主义建设的积累。在这一点上，妇女便特别担负着比男子更重要的责任。因此，我们热切期望全国妇女同胞们和全国人民一起，坚持反对资产阶级的腐朽的生活作风，发扬我国优良的勤俭传统，树立艰苦朴素的新的道德风尚，更好地为社会主义建设服务。
    各位代表，你们一定是已经认识到的。我国在党的领导下，社会主义的经济基础基本上是已经奠定了，但是社会主义的上层建筑还有待于我们的建设。这就是说，我们在意识形态上、在思想上，还远远落后于实际。为此，党发起了整风运动，以便更快更好地进行社会主义建设。然而资产阶级右派分子和其他反共、反人民、反社会主义分子却趁着党进行整风运动的时机，丧心病狂地从城乡各个方面向党发动了猖狂的进攻，企图推翻共产党的领导和社会主义制度，使资产阶级复辟。这是我国人民也是我国广大妇女群众所绝对不能容忍的。全国在党的领导下已经展开了全民大辩论，给这些反动分子以全面的坚决的回击。我们必须辨明大是大非，坚决拥护党的领导，走社会主义的道路。因此，目前的反右派斗争正是思想上的社会主义革命。我们在经济战线上取得胜利之后，必须在政治上和思想上取得同样的胜利。我们要彻底克服资产阶级的和其他落后的思想，才能取得社会主义革命的彻底胜利。要这样，我们的人民民主专政才能巩固，我们的社会主义建设事业才能更顺利地发展。因此，目前是一个重要的关头。我们每一个人都必须站稳立场，和右派分子的思想划清界限，通过社会主义这一大关。
    各位代表，这一次代表大会是在反击右派的高潮期中召开，这就为大会增加了一个严肃的任务。我们希望大会在社会主义的旗帜下进行大鸣、大放、大争，积极投入反击资产阶级右派分子的斗争，在全国范围内展开社会主义的思想教育，使这一教育深入到社会的每一个方面，深入到每一个人的心里。
    马克思列宁主义是要战胜一切的！
    请让我们永远紧密地团结在党的周围，发挥一切的力量，克服一切的阻碍，为社会主义革命的彻底胜利而奋斗。
    国际民主妇女联合会副主席
    普什帕莫耶·鲍斯小姐致词
    主席、各位朋友：
    值此中华全国民主妇女联合会召开第三次全国妇女代表大会之际，我能有这样好的机会代表国际民主妇女联合会前来向你们致贺，为此我向你们大家致衷心的感谢。
    国际民主妇女联合会向各位致最热烈的祝贺，并衷心祝贺大会成功。
    全世界妇女抱着极大的兴趣和非常羡慕的心情关怀着你们的进展。
    中国在过去短短的几年中创造了奇迹，将亿万中国妇女从束缚和苦难以及殖民主义的祸害下解放出来了。你们在如此短的时间内在改善妇女、儿童生活方面所作出的卓越成绩被誉为是全世界妇女运动中的一项杰出的成就。
    大会在当今世界历史发展这样一个重要的关头召开，是有其特别重要意义的。全世界正在被一种从来没有见过的狂热所摇撼着。你们的决议将给全世界妇女争取持久和平的努力带来新的光明。你们的决议将使正在发展的妇女争取自身权利、儿童权利、和那些仍然为殖民主义盘踞着的国家——特别是亚洲和非洲国家——的争取民族独立的运动更加向前推进一步。
    你们中国的姐妹们，通过在争取解放斗争时期所遭受的数不尽的痛苦和牺牲以后，已经成为争取和平的忠诚的战士。你们国家给全世界带来了共处的讯息，这是世界持久和平和友谊的首要和最终的目的。你们的大会将增强全世界妇女的力量来继续进行她们争取和平与团结的工作。
    国际民主妇女联合会是代表妇女事业的；它是争取和平的战士。目前摆在我们面前的首要任务就是使和平的呼声高涨来反对那种不仅想摧毁和平、而且企图毁灭整个世界的势力。只有在和平的社会里，妇女才能成长并获得她们应有的地位，和为她们的孩子创造幸福和安宁的家庭。
    将要到来的国际民主妇女联合会第四次世界妇女大会从妇女和儿童事业的各方面来看，都将是很重要的一次大会。
    你们这次的大会对于第四次世界妇女大会来说是一个很显著的贡献，它为进一步团结和合作，以及争取妇女权利、儿童幸福与和平工作的共同纲领的进展带来新的光辉。我们向大会欢呼，我们在团结、统一和友爱的口号下向你们大家，你们中国的姐妹们致贺。
