Observations on Inspecting Road Maintenance Work
National People's Congress Representative Gao Shuxun

Relying on the Masses for Road Maintenance

From March to May this year, I inspected road maintenance work in Shandong and Jiangsu provinces and felt that some of their practices were well worth learning.

These provinces, in accordance with the State Council's regulations on road construction and diligence, have established and consolidated mass road maintenance teams. Regular maintenance by the masses and road crews has replaced the twice-yearly major overhauls, saving manpower, ensuring normal traffic, and gradually improving line quality.

How can mass road maintenance teams be quickly established and consolidated? According to their experience, the most important thing is to effectively combine the interests of the state with those of the cooperative and its members.

On the premise of not affecting the highway or hindering traffic, they mobilize the masses to make full use of the roadbed edges, slopes, and highway land reserves to plant roadside trees and low forests with greater economic value, with all proceeds going to the cooperative. In Shandong, I visited an agricultural cooperative in Zhangqiao Township, Huantai County. Last year, they planted purple locust on the two-kilometer section they were responsible for maintaining and received an income of 300 yuan that year. More than 10,000 apple trees were planted on the highway land reserve between Yantai and Laiyang. Jiangsu planted daylilies on many sections of the road, generating an annual income of 70 yuan per kilometer. Some sections planted osier (commonly known as basket willow, whose branches can be used to weave baskets and make wicker trunks), which will yield a harvest next year after planting this year.

When using construction and diligence work hours, they plan in advance, save manpower as much as possible, and make the most of agricultural slack seasons to repair roads. The Yixing Road Maintenance District in Jiangsu calculated and arranged the annual construction and diligence tasks before the start of the year, and notified the cooperative of the time and quantity at once, so that the cooperative could make good overall arrangements for labor.

Shandong adopted these methods and maintained the roads very well. I looked at more than 1,000 kilometers of various roads in Shandong. Although some of them were dirt roads, they were maintained very smoothly, and cars could drive at 40 kilometers per hour. On road sections with pavement, it was generally possible to drive at more than 50 kilometers per hour. On the Yan(tai)-Wei(xian) Road, the tires pressed the wear-resistant layer so black and shiny that it looked like an asphalt road from a distance. The roadside trees on both sides were also very neat, and the route was very straight, making the road look beautiful. On this road, our car drove at 58 kilometers per hour, almost approaching the speed of a train.

On each line, I saw many migrant workers working on the road, and I encountered a group every short distance. I visited several places, and their sense of responsibility was very strong. The masses had no objections. When talking about migrant workers' construction and diligence with the townships, cooperatives, and cadres, everyone felt that this approach was practical and feasible.

Both Cheap and Good

In 1953, dirt roads accounted for 94% of the mileage open to traffic in Shandong. Since 1954, they have used weathered stone, coarse sand, cohesive soil, broken bricks, saline soil, shells, and furnace slag to improve dirt roads in accordance with the principle of "adapting to local conditions and using local materials." Thanks to full reliance on the masses and effective management, the cost is very low. For materials transported within one kilometer, the actual expenditure per kilometer in the province averaged only 50 to 70 yuan last year.

Jiangsu used gravel, broken bricks, shells, and clay to add various wear-resistant layers to more than 800 kilometers of roads, increasing the mileage of each tire from more than 21,000 kilometers to more than 50,900 kilometers, extending the service life by 143%. The solid fuel used by automobiles was reduced by 28% compared with the past, and the liquid fuel was reduced by 4%. Due to the smooth road surface, the average speed of automobiles also increased by about 10 kilometers per hour compared with the past.

Hebei Province's Highway Work is Lagging Behind

Since I am responsible for part of the work in Hebei, I will offer some opinions on road maintenance in Hebei. From a quantitative point of view, Hebei Province already has more than 13,000 kilometers of highways, which is not a small number, but from a qualitative point of view, it is far from being able to meet the needs of increasingly busy transportation. The phenomenon of dust flying on sunny days and mud being difficult to walk through after rain is very serious. Because of the poor road quality, the average speed of cars in the province is only a little over 18 kilometers per hour, which is more than half slower than in Jiangsu, Shandong, and other provinces. In other words, one car in Shandong, Jiangsu, and other provinces is as good as two cars in Hebei. Why are the roads in Hebei Province so bad? The main reason is the problem of "emphasizing construction and neglecting maintenance." From the perspective of the Provincial Department of Transportation, for a long time, the important significance of "building one and maintaining one" and "improving in stages and gradually improving" has not been deeply understood, and they are still accustomed to two major overhauls a year. In particular, after agricultural cooperativization, the original mass road maintenance organizations collapsed, and no measures were taken to re-establish them, so that road maintenance work was almost in a state of no one being responsible. Now, all kinds of construction are advancing by leaps and bounds. If the highway sector does not catch up quickly, it will be unimaginable. We must reverse the idea of "emphasizing construction and neglecting maintenance" in the spirit of rectification and do a good job in road maintenance. We should give full play to the fine tradition of mass road maintenance, improve road crews and mass road maintenance organizations; strengthen business guidance to the county transportation sections and give play to their role; provincial roads and county roads should be maintained separately, and the Department of Transportation should appropriately decentralize a part of the routes to the counties for management, and the province should provide business guidance and technical assistance. We must also do a good job in highway greening. The required tree species should be resolved by the transportation department in consultation with the agricultural and forestry departments, and the expenses should be paid from the road maintenance fees. All the benefits from greening should go to the agricultural cooperatives that maintain the roads. Finally, it is necessary to emphasize that road maintenance is a mass work, and the efforts of the highway department alone are not enough. The Party and government at all levels in Hebei Province should strengthen specific leadership, listen to their reports, inspect their work, solve their problems, and include road maintenance work in their daily work, so as to change the backward situation of highways in Hebei Province as soon as possible.

　　视察养路工作的观感
　　全国人民代表大会代表  高树勋
　　依靠群众养路
    今年3月到5月，我视察了山东、江苏等省的养路工作，感到他们的一些作法很值得学习。
    这几个省按照国务院关于道路建勤的规定，已把群众养路组建立与巩固起来。群众和道班的经常养护代替了一年两次大普修，既节省民力，又保证了正常通行，还可以逐步提高线路质量。
    怎样把群众养路组很快地建立与巩固起来呢？根据他们的经验，最重要的是要把国家的利益与社的、社员的利益很好地结合起来。
    他们在不影响公路、不妨碍行车的前提下，发动群众充分利用路基边缘、边坡和公路留用地，种植一些经济价值较大的行道树和矮林，收益全部归社。我在山东曾访问桓台县张桥乡的一个农业社，去年他们在负责养护的两公里地段上种了紫穗槐，当年即得到三百元的收益；烟台到莱阳间的公路留用地上，种了一万多株苹果树；江苏在许多路段上种了金针菜，每年每公里可以有七十元的收益；有的地段种杞柳（俗称簸箕柳，枝条可以编筐、做柳条箱），今年种上，明年就有收成。
    他们在使用建勤工时，事先有计划，而且尽量节省民力，尽量利用农隙修路。江苏宜兴养路工区在年度开始以前，根据道路情况计算与安排了全年建勤任务，把使用的时间和数量一次通知到社，社里就可以很好地统筹安排劳动力。
    山东采用了上面这些办法，把路养得很好。我在山东看了各种道路一千多公里，其中有几条虽是土路，养护得也很平坦，车子可以开到每小时四十公里；在铺有路面的路段，一般可以开到五十公里以上。烟（台）潍（县）路轮带把磨耗层压得又黑又亮，远远望去和柏油路一样，两侧的行道树也很整齐，路线又很直顺，路容很美。在这条路上，我们车子开到五十八公里，差不多已经接近火车的速度了。
    在各线我看到很多上路干活的民工，走不远就遇到一拨。我访问了几处，他们的事业心全很强，群众也没有什么意见，在乡、社和干部们谈起民工建勤来，也全觉得这样做是切实可行的。
    又便宜又好
    1953年，山东的土路占通车里程的94％，1954年以来，他们根据“因地制宜、就地取材”的原则，用风化石、粗砂、粘性土壤、碎砖、盐渍土、贝壳和炉渣等材料改善了土路。由于充分依靠群众和管理得法，造价很便宜。材料运距在一公里以内的，去年全省平均每公里实际开支仅五十至七十元。
    江苏用砾石、碎砖、贝壳和粘土等材料，在八百多公里的路面上加铺了各种磨耗层，使每副轮胎从行驶二万一千多公里提高到能够行驶五万零九百多公里，使用年限延长了143％；汽车用的固体燃料较前降低28％，液体燃料降低4％；由于路面平整，汽车的平均时速也较过去增加十公里左右。
    河北省的公路工作落后了
    由于我在河北负责一部分工作，就河北的养路工作讲一些意见。河北省的公路，从数量上看，已有一万三千多公里，为数不算少，但从质量上讲，却远远不能适应日益繁忙的运输需要。晴天尘土飞扬、雨后泥泞难走的现象非常严重，因为道路质量坏，全省汽车平均时速仅十八公里多，比江苏、山东等省慢一半以上，也就是说，山东、江苏等省的一辆车顶河北两辆使。为什么河北省的公路坏到这种程度呢？主要是在于“重修轻养”的毛病。从省交通厅来说，长期以来对于“修一条、养一条”，“分期改善、逐步提高”的重要意义体验不深刻，仍然习惯于一年两次大普修。特别是农业合作化后，原有的群众养路组织垮了台，也没有采取措施重新建立，使养路工作几乎处于无人负责状态。现在，各项建设突飞猛进，公路方面如不奋起直追，将是不堪设想的。我们必须以整风的精神来扭转“重修轻养”的思想，作好道路的养护工作。应当充分发挥群众养路的优良传统，健全道班和群众养路组织；加强对县交通科的业务指导，发挥他们的作用；省道和县道要分开养，交通厅要适当下放一部分路线交县掌握，省里给以业务指导和技术帮助。还要做好公路绿化工作，所需树种由交通部门商请农林部门解决，费用由养路费开支，绿化收益全部归养路的农业社。最后，还需要强调说明一下，养路工作是群众性的工作，只凭公路部门的努力是不够的。河北省的各级党、政应该加强具体领导，听取他们的汇报，检查他们的工作，解决他们的问题，把养路工作列入日常工作，以尽快地改变河北省公路的落后面貌。
