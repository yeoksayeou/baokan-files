　　The task of the struggle of the people of our country against the bourgeois right-wingers is to thoroughly complete the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. This revolution has not been completed. Many people do not yet recognize this point. The right-wingers have always opposed this revolution and have even developed to the point of being anti-communist and anti-people in their actions. This revolution is an indispensable supplement and an inevitable continuation of the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production that reached its climax in 1956. What we now call the socialist revolution is often called socialist transformation. In 1956, in terms of the economic system, that is, in terms of the relations of production, mainly in the ownership of the means of production, the socialist transformation was basically completed (not finally completed), but the transformation of people was not completed. And the bourgeois right-wingers most resolutely opposed this transformation. The Chinese Communist Party has repeatedly pointed out the necessity and possibility of the transformation of people, but it has been unable to persuade the reactionary bourgeois right-wingers.
　　The great change in the ownership of the means of production in our country in 1956 did not encounter serious resistance. This is because, in the rural areas of our country, the poor and lower-middle peasants, who constitute the majority of the population, urgently demanded cooperation, and the well-to-do middle peasants could not but follow the trend under this situation, and at the same time, many of them did indeed recognize the benefits of cooperation. The socialist high tide in the countryside promoted the socialist high tide in the cities. Private industrial and commercial enterprises were transformed into joint state-private enterprises, and handicrafts were also cooperativized. Due to the rapid development of state-owned enterprises, joint state-private enterprises, and cooperatives, bourgeois industrialists and businessmen had no other way out in 1956 except to accept socialism. At the same time, after the serious struggle of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements in 1952, most bourgeois industrialists and businessmen also greatly reduced their courage to oppose the working people.
　　As for the original landlord class, the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and the original Kuomintang military and political personnel, they had long been discredited and had no more capital to oppose the working people.
　　The social forces that considered themselves to still have the capital to oppose the working people were mainly the bourgeois parties and the bourgeois intellectuals. The bourgeois parties developed in the process of China's bourgeois democratic revolution. They had participated in the struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries to varying degrees, so they were democratic parties. Because of this situation, after liberation, the democratic parties were given considerable status in the National People's Congress, the People's Congresses of various provinces and cities, the political consultative institutions at all levels, and the people's governments at all levels above the county and city levels. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, they participated in some revolutionary mass movements to varying degrees and had repeatedly declared that they supported socialism and accepted the leadership of the Communist Party. The situation of the bourgeois intellectuals was roughly similar to that of the democratic parties. In fact, most democratic parties were based on bourgeois intellectuals, and their tendencies generally represented many non-party bourgeois intellectuals. Bourgeois intellectuals had one more capital than bourgeois political activists: most of them directly participated in socialist construction, and the proletariat needed them in various departments of economy and culture.
　　Among the democratic parties and the bourgeois intellectual circles, there were some right-wingers who opposed socialism. It was not that they did not know that socialism was the only way out for the majority of the people in China today, and it was not that they did not know that socialism had created rapid progress for China in the past few years, and without socialism, this progress would not have been possible. But the problem was that socialism required the planned development of the entire national economy and cultural and educational undertakings, and required bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals to subordinate their personal interests and will to the unified interests and will of the broad masses of the people. This was what they considered intolerable. Therefore, they were determined to compete with the proletariat.
　　However, the bourgeois right-wing political activists and intellectuals, although they did hate socialism and were confident that they still had the ability to appeal, did not raise the banner of anti-socialism in the high tide of the socialist revolution in 1956. First of all, as mentioned above, they were isolated among the people of the whole country. They could not shake the alliance of the working class and the poor peasants, nor could they get the support of the majority of industrialists and businessmen and well-to-do middle peasants. Secondly, even within the democratic parties and the bourgeois intellectual circles, they were in the minority. In the democratic parties and the bourgeois intellectual circles, due to China's historical conditions and the Communist Party's policy of unity, education, and transformation towards them, a left wing that had turned to the proletarian stand had been formed, but because the time of the socialist revolution was not long, they were still a relatively small minority. The majority of the democratic parties and the bourgeois intellectual circles were still wavering between the left and right wings in the socialist revolution. They had not given up their attachment to capitalism, but they did not hate socialism either. In view of this situation, the bourgeois right-wingers decided to stand still in 1956 and wait for the opportunity.
　　According to the right-wingers, the "favorable" opportunity for them would always come. The Hungarian incident was their opportunity. Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people was also their opportunity. In May 1957, the Communist Party decided to rectify its work style, which was of course an even better opportunity for the right-wingers. So they launched a major offensive against the proletariat, the working people, and the revolutionary intellectuals, and against the proletarian party, the Communist Party. They attacked various socialist systems and policies, especially the proletarian dictatorship and the leadership of the Communist Party. They openly opposed the leading position of the Communist Party and demanded that the Communist Party step down.
　　The hypocritical mask of the bourgeois right-wingers who supported socialism was torn off, and their ferocious face of opposing the working people was revealed. They proved by their actions that their contradictions with the working people were no longer contradictions among the people, but irreconcilable life-and-death contradictions between ourselves and the enemy. The class struggle that had tended to ease up was once again intensified due to the rampant offensive of the right-wingers. The people could not but resolutely and thoroughly smash the offensive of the bourgeois right-wingers. The people realized that the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production must be followed by the socialist revolution on the political front, that is, a resolute and thorough political struggle against the bourgeois right-wingers who were hostile to socialism, until they surrendered. If this battle is not won, there is no hope for socialism.
　　The so-called socialist revolution on the political front does not mean seizing power. In our country, the issue of political power was basically resolved in 1949. The proletariat has firmly grasped the lifeline of the country, so it is possible to carry out the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production by combining the methods of top-down and bottom-up. But the offensive of the right-wingers proves that the leadership of the proletariat over state power is not yet consolidated in some respects. The proletariat has not yet truly established its leadership over some state organs and some cultural and educational organizations. For the right-wingers, the proletariat cannot possibly realize leadership, because they are the enemies of the proletariat. For the middle elements, especially those who are deeply influenced by the right-wingers, the proletariat also has only a not very solid leadership. One of the major tasks of the anti-rightist struggle is to consolidate the leadership of the proletariat in all aspects of our country.
　　The so-called socialist revolution on the political front does not mean arresting the right-wingers (unless they are active counter-revolutionaries and criminal offenders), or physically eliminating them. The method of opposing the right-wingers is still mass debates, still presenting facts and reasoning, and refuting the right-wingers one by one. The situation in our country does not require extreme policies towards the right-wingers. We must resolutely smash the offensive of the right-wingers, and we must also give all right-wingers who are willing to sincerely repent the opportunity to reform, especially to educate the broad masses in the anti-rightist struggle.
　　Educating the broad masses in the anti-rightist struggle includes both the left wing and the middle wing. For the left wing, it is to raise their awareness and be tempered in the struggle. For the middle wing, it is to draw a clear line ideologically from the right wing, to overcome their wavering two-sidedness between the capitalist stand and the socialist stand, to carry out self-transformation ideologically, to pass the socialist test well, and to have a part of them join the left wing and expand the ranks of the left wing. The so-called socialist revolution on the ideological front is mainly for the middle wing.
　　The middle wing can cooperate with the proletariat, and is also what the proletariat must strive for, but there are contradictions between them and the proletariat. This contradiction is a contradiction among the people, and should be resolved according to the formula of "unity-criticism-unity."
　　The so-called middle wing refers to people who waver between the left wing and the right wing, between socialism and capitalism, and between revolution and reaction. The left wing and the right wing are resolute, while the middle wing is not resolute. As far as the people of the whole country are concerned, the left wing is the overwhelming majority, the middle wing is the minority, and the right wing is the extremely small minority. But as far as the current situation of the intellectual circles is concerned, as mentioned above, the left wing is still a relatively small minority, and the majority is still the middle wing. The middle wing can follow the right wing, or it can follow the left wing. The reason why the right wing dares to attack is because of the existence of the middle wing, and because the right wing still has the possibility of competing with the left wing for the middle wing. Therefore, without solving the political stance of this part of the people, the anti-rightist struggle cannot achieve a complete victory.
　　Intellectuals serve a certain economic base, and their relationship with the economic base is like the relationship between hair and skin. Now, the old capitalist economic base has perished, and if the skin is gone, what will the hair attach to? The only way out is to start a new life on the new socialist economic base, that is, to integrate with the working people and serve the great socialist cause wholeheartedly. Otherwise, intellectuals will become "gentlemen on the beam" who are neither up to the sky nor down to the earth. The current middle-of-the-road intellectuals are somewhat similar to this kind of "gentlemen on the beam" if they do not turn to the left and do not lean towards the working people. This is an inevitable phenomenon in the transition period, because although they do not resolutely support capitalism, they have not yet made mental preparations for participating in the socialist revolution. They still have nostalgia for the old world and are still somewhat unfamiliar with the new society, and often have a feeling of "not being able to control their own destiny." Of course, this phenomenon will not last long. They or the vast majority of them will eventually stand on the side of the proletariat and the working people after a period of time. Similarly, the majority of industrialists and businessmen in the cities and the well-to-do middle peasants in the countryside are currently also wavering between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. The task of the proletariat, the broad working people, and the revolutionary intellectuals is to unite all those who are still in the middle state and help them shorten the time of wavering as much as possible. In order to unite the middle wing, it is necessary to resolutely oppose the right wing and criticize the wavering nature of the middle wing. The ideological revolution is to eliminate their wavering nature and turn them into true socialist intellectuals, socialist industrial and commercial workers, and socialist peasants.
　　The current anti-rightist struggle has developed into a nationwide struggle. This struggle is of great and decisive significance for crushing the right-wingers, educating the middle-of-the-roaders and everyone in the society. Of course, one struggle cannot solve all problems. In order to completely solve the problem, it will take a considerable amount of time.
　　The victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front, in the ownership of the means of production, enables us to have better conditions for carrying out the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts; and the victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts will in turn promote and strengthen the socialist revolution on the economic front, and accelerate the establishment of a modern industrial base and a modern agricultural base. At present, the material basis of socialism in our country is still very inadequate, which is an objective reason why the right-wingers still dare to attack and the middle-of-the-roaders are still wavering. Only when a relatively sufficient material basis is established, will our country, our socialist economic system and political system, be fully consolidated. Striving for the comprehensive victory of the entire socialist revolution is the great historical task of the people of our country in the entire transition period, and it will still take ten to fifteen years. The proletariat, the working people, the revolutionary intellectuals, and all patriotic people who support socialism throughout the country should unite as one, step up their efforts, improve their work, and strive to complete this historical task as soon as possible and as completely as possible, and build a fully consolidated socialist society.

### 这是政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命

　　这是政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命
    我国人民群众反对资产阶级右派分子的斗争的任务，是为了在政治战线上和思想战线上彻底完成社会主义革命。这个革命是没有完成的。许多人还不认识这一点。右派分子则从来就反对这种革命，并且发展到在行动上反共反人民。这个革命是1956年达到高潮的生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命的必不可少的补充和必不可免的继续。我们现在所说的社会主义革命，许多时候叫作社会主义改造。在1956年，在经济制度方面，即在生产关系方面，主要是在生产资料所有制方面的社会主义改造，基本上完成了（没有最后完成），人的改造则没有完成。而资产阶级右派分子则最坚决地反对这种改造。中国共产党曾经再三再四地指出人的改造的必要性和可能性，可是无法说服反动的资产阶级右派。
    1956年的我国生产资料所有制的大变革并没有遇到严重的抵抗。这是因为，在我国农村中，占人口大多数的贫农和下中农迫切要求合作化，富裕中农在这种形势下不能不追随潮流，同时他们中间有很多人也确实认识了合作化的利益。农村的社会主义高潮促进了城市的社会主义高潮，私营工商业实行公私合营了，手工业也合作化了。由于国营企业、公私合营企业和合作社的迅速发展，资产阶级工商业者在1956年除了接受社会主义以外，已经没有别的出路。同时，资产阶级工商业者经过了1952年的“三反”“五反”运动的严重斗争，多数人也大大减少了反对劳动人民的勇气。
    至于原来的地主阶级、官僚资产阶级，原来的国民党军政人员，他们早已名誉扫地，更加没有反对劳动人民的资本了。
    自以为还有反对劳动人民的资本的社会力量，主要的是资产阶级的党派和资产阶级的知识分子。资产阶级党派是在我国资产阶级民主革命的过程中发展起来的，它们曾经在不同程度上参加过反对国民党反动派的斗争，所以是民主党派。由于这种情况，解放以后，各民主党派在全国人民代表大会、各省市人民代表大会、各级政治协商机构和县市以上的各级人民政府中都被给予相当的地位。它们在共产党的领导下，或多或少地参加了一些革命的群众运动，并且曾经多次宣布它们拥护社会主义，接受共产党的领导。资产阶级知识分子的情况大体上也类似民主党派。实际上，多数民主党派是以资产阶级知识分子为基础的，它们的倾向一般也代表着许多无党派的资产阶级知识分子。资产阶级知识分子比起资产阶级政治活动家还多一种资本：他们的大部分直接参加着社会主义建设，无产阶级在经济文化的种种部门需要着他们。
    在各民主党派和资产阶级知识界中，都有一部分右派，他们是反对社会主义的。他们并非不知道社会主义是今天中国大多数人民的唯一出路，并非不知道社会主义在过去几年中已经为中国造成了一日千里的进步，没有社会主义，这种进步是不可能的。但是问题是社会主义要求整个国民经济和文化教育事业的有计划的发展，要求资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子把个人的利益和意志服从于广大人民的统一的利益和意志。这是他们所认为不能忍受的。因此他们决心要同无产阶级较量一下。
    但是资产阶级右派的政治活动家和知识分子，虽然确是痛恨社会主义，并且自信还有号召的能力，也并没有在1956年的社会主义革命高潮中竖起反社会主义的旗帜。首先，如上面所说，他们在全国人民中间是孤立的。他们不但不能动摇工人阶级和贫苦农民的联盟，也得不到工商业者和富裕中农的多数的支持。其次，就在各民主党派中和资产阶级知识界中，他们也处于少数的地位。在各民主党派中，在资产阶级知识界中，由于中国的历史条件和共产党对他们所采取的团结教育改造的政策，已经形成了一个转入无产阶级立场的左派，但是因为社会主义革命的时间还不长，他们也还是一个比较的少数。各民主党派和资产阶级知识界的多数，在社会主义革命中，还在动摇观望于左右两翼之间。他们还没有放弃对于资本主义的依恋，但是他们也并不敌视社会主义。鉴于这种情况，资产阶级右派在1956年决定按兵不动，等待时机。
    按照右派分子的观点，对他们“有利”的时机总是会来的。匈牙利事件是他们的时机。毛主席报告正确处理人民内部矛盾又是他们的时机。1957年5月，共产党决定整风，这对于右派分子当然更是好时机。于是他们向无产阶级、劳动人民和革命知识分子，向无产阶级的政党共产党，发起了大举进攻。他们攻击社会主义的各种制度和政策，特别是攻击无产阶级专政和共产党的领导。他们公开地反对共产党的领导地位，并且要求共产党下台。
    资产阶级右派的拥护社会主义的假面具撕破了，反对劳动人民的凶恶面目露出来了。他们用自己的行动证明：他们同劳动人民的矛盾不再是人民内部的矛盾，而是敌我之间的不可调和的你死我活的矛盾。曾经趋于缓和的阶级斗争，由于右派的猖狂进攻，再一次尖锐化起来了。人民群众不能不坚决地彻底地粉碎资产阶级右派的进攻。人民群众认识了，生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命，不能不随之以政治战线上的社会主义革命，即是对敌视社会主义的资产阶级右派进行坚决的彻底的政治斗争，直至他们投降为止。如果这一仗不打胜，社会主义是没有希望的。
    所谓政治战线上的社会主义革命，并不是说取得政权。在我国，政权问题在1949年已经基本上解决了。无产阶级已经牢牢地掌握了国家的命脉，因此才有可能用由上而下和由下而上相结合的方法进行生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命。但是右派分子的进攻证明，无产阶级对于国家政权的领导，就某些方面说来，还不是巩固的。无产阶级对于某些国家机关和某些文教组织还没有真正建立起自己的领导。对于右派分子，无产阶级当然不可能实现领导，因为他们是无产阶级的敌人。对于中间分子，特别是受右派影响较深的那些中间分子，无产阶级也只有一种不甚巩固的领导。反右派斗争的重大任务之一，就是要在我们国家的一切方面把无产阶级的领导巩固地树立起来。
    所谓政治战线上的社会主义革命，也不是说要把右派分子（除非是现行的反革命分子和刑事犯罪分子）逮捕起来，或者加以肉体上的消灭。反对右派分子的方法，仍然是群众性的辩论，仍然是摆事实，说道理，把右派分子一一地驳倒。我们国家的情况不需要对右派采取极端的政策。我们要坚决粉碎右派的进攻，我们也要使一切愿意真诚悔改的右派分子得到改造的机会，尤其是要使广大群众在反右派斗争中得到教育。
    使广大群众在反右派斗争中得到教育，这里包括左派和中间派。对于左派，是要使他们在斗争中提高觉悟和受到锻炼。对于中间派，是要使他们在思想上同右派划清界限，克服自己在资本主义立场和社会主义立场中间动摇不定的两面性，是要在思想上进行自我改造，过好社会主义这一关，并且有一部分从中间派归入左派，扩大左派的队伍。所谓思想战线上的社会主义革命，主要地就是对中间派说的。
    中间派是可以同无产阶级合作的，也是无产阶级所必须争取的，但是他们同无产阶级之间有矛盾。这种矛盾是人民内部的矛盾，应当按照“团结—批评—团结”的公式去解决。
  所谓中间派，就是动摇于左派和右派之间、社会主义和资本主义之间、革命和反动之间的人们。左派和右派都是坚决的，而中间派是不坚决的。就全国人民来说，左派是绝大多数，中间派是少数，右派更是极少数。但是就目前的知识界的情况说来，如前面所说，左派暂时也还是比较的少数，多数还是中间派。中间派可以跟着右派走，也可以跟着左派走。右派之所以敢于进攻，就是由于中间派的存在，就是由于右派还有可能同左派争夺中间派。因此，不解决这一部分人的政治立场问题，反右派斗争就不能获得彻底的胜利。
    知识分子是为一定的经济基础服务的，他们同经济基础的关系，好比毛同皮的关系。现在，旧的资本主义的经济基础已经灭亡了，皮之不存，毛将焉附？唯一的出路，就是在新的社会主义的经济基础上开始新生活，就是同劳动人民打成一片，全心全意地为伟大的社会主义事业服务。否则，知识分子就会成为上不沾天下不着地的“梁上君子”。目前的中间派的知识分子，如果不向左转，不向劳动人民靠拢，就多少类似这种“梁上君子”。这是过渡时期的不可避免的现象，因为他们虽然并不坚决拥护资本主义，但是毕竟还没有参加社会主义革命的精神准备。他们对旧世界还有留恋，对新社会还有些生疏，常有“不能掌握自己命运”之感。当然，这种现象是不会持久的。他们或者他们中间的绝大多数，经过一段时间，终将站到无产阶级和劳动人民方面来。同样，城市中的工商业者，农村中的富裕中农，多数在目前也在动摇于社会主义和资本主义两条道路之间。无产阶级、广大的劳动人民和革命的知识分子的任务，就是要团结一切还处于中间状态的人们，帮助他们尽量缩短动摇的时间。为了团结中间派，就要坚决反对右派，并且批评中间派的动摇性。思想革命就是要革掉他们的动摇性，使他们变成真正的社会主义的知识分子、社会主义的工商业工作者和社会主义的农民。
    目前的反右派斗争已经发展成为全民性的斗争。这一场斗争对于粉碎右派，教育中间派和社会上的一切人，都具有伟大的决定的意义。当然，一次斗争不能解决一切问题。为了完全解决问题，还需要一个相当长的时间。
    在经济战线上，在生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命的胜利，使我们有更好的条件来进行政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命；而政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命的胜利，又将反过来促进和加强经济战线上的社会主义革命，加速现代化的工业基础和现代化的农业基础的建立。目前我国社会主义的物质基础还很不充分，这是右派还敢于进攻和中间派还在动摇的一个客观原因。只有建立了比较充分的物质基础，我们的国家，我们的社会主义经济制度和政治制度，才算充分巩固。争取整个社会主义革命的全面胜利，这是我国人民在整个过渡时期的伟大历史任务，它将还需要经过十年至十五年之久。全国的无产阶级、劳动人民、革命知识分子和全体拥护社会主义的爱国人民应当团结一致，加紧努力，改进工作，为尽快地和尽可能完满地完成这个历史任务，建成完全巩固的社会主义社会而奋斗。
