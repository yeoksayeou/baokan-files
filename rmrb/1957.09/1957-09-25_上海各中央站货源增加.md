Shanghai's central stations are making every effort to increase the supply of goods in order to meet the needs of various markets during the peak season. For commodities where demand exceeds supply, they are actively organizing production and expanding procurement, provided that raw materials and production can be resolved. According to the current situation, the supply of some tight commodities to various regions in the second half of this year will increase significantly compared to the second half of last year. For example, the supply of rubber shoes and bicycles will increase by more than 20%; radios, light bulbs, wool scarves, wool gloves, and steel pots will all increase by more than double. In terms of small commodities, the demand and available supply are close to balanced, and some goods are even more abundant.

The Shanghai Central Textile Station, during the summer, not only transferred as much of the stock of light-colored floral cloth as possible to the sales areas, but also changed the originally planned production of light-colored floral cloth to 28 million meters of dark-colored varieties, increasing the reserves of autumn and winter goods. Measures such as early production and early storage have been taken for flannel and other items. In addition, they continue to shorten the waiting time for cotton cloth transportation, so that Shanghai products can reach sales areas as soon as possible.

    上海各中央站货源增加
    本报讯　上海各中央站为满足各地市场旺季需要，正千方百计地增加货源。对供不应求的商品，在原料和生产都能解决的前提下，积极组织生产、扩大收购。按目前情况来看，部分供应紧张的商品今年下半年对各地的供应量将比去年下半年增加很多。如胶鞋、自行车等将增加20％以上；收音机、灯泡、羊毛围巾、羊毛手套、钢精锅等均增加一倍以上。小百货方面，要货和可供量接近平衡，有部分货源更较充沛。
    纺织品上海中央站在夏季就一面把库存浅花布尽量下放到销区，一面把原定生产的浅花布，改印二千八百万公尺为深色品种，增加了秋冬商品的储备。对绒布等采取了提前生产、提前储备的措施。此外他们还继续缩短棉布待运日程，使上海产品能早日到达销地。
