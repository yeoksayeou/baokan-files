    Condemning British Atomic War Policy, Demanding the U.S. Withdraw its Bases in Britain.
    London Public Demonstration
    This newspaper's London dispatch, 22nd – Today, over four thousand people participated in a demonstration in London's Trafalgar Square, demanding the prohibition of the hydrogen bomb.
    This conference was initiated by the Anti-Hydrogen Bomb Movement Committee, composed of dozens of Labour Party members. Participating in today's demonstration were large numbers of workers, women, and others. At 3:00 PM, they arrived at Trafalgar Square, holding numerous banners reading "Prohibit the Hydrogen Bomb."
    Many well-known Labour Party members participated in the demonstration and spoke at the conference. They unanimously condemned the British government's atomic war policy and demanded that the United States withdraw its military bases in Britain. Labour Party member Harold Davies said, "Britain, believing it can implement a national defense policy of rockets and hydrogen bombs, is in fact putting itself on the economic death line." Labour Party member Mikardo said in a letter to the conference, "We cannot tolerate the United States maintaining military bases in our country."

    伦敦公众游行示威
    本报伦敦22日电　今天在伦敦特拉法加广场举行了四千余人参加的要求禁止氢弹的游行示威大会。
    这次大会是由数十个工党议员组成的反对氢弹运动委员会发起的。参加今天示威游行的有广大的工人、妇女等。他们在下午三时高举着无数的“禁止氢弹”的标语，到达了特拉法加广场。
    许多著名的工党议员参加了这次游行，并且在大会上讲了话。他们一致谴责英国政府的原子战争政策，并要求美国撤出在英国的军事基地。工党议员哈罗德·戴维斯说：“英国自以为它可以执行火箭与氢弹的国防政策，结果使得它自己处于经济上的死亡线上。”工党议员麦卡多在他给大会的一封信中说：“我们不能容忍美国在我们国家保留军事基地。”
