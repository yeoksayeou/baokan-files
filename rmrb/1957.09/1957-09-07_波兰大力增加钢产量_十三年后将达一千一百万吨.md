    Poland Vigorously Increases Steel Production
    Will Reach 11 Million Tons in Thirteen Years
    (Our dispatch from Warsaw, September 6) By 1970, Poland's steel production will reach 11 million tons. Poland's current annual steel production is approximately 5 million tons. In 1937, before liberation, Poland's annual steel production was less than 1.5 million tons. This projected figure was determined by the Polish Metallurgical Industry Design Bureau in formulating a long-term plan for the Polish metallurgical industry. The long-term plan also stipulates that one of the main methods for increasing steel production will be to renovate existing steel furnaces to meet modern technical requirements. To this end, the renovation of steel furnaces will be carried out in Poland's thirteen metallurgical combines during this period, making it a modern and large-scale project.

    波兰大力增加钢产量
    十三年后将达一千一百万吨
    本报华沙6日电  到1970年波兰的产钢量将达到一千一百万吨。波兰目前钢的年产量约五百万吨。在解放前的1937年波兰钢的年产量不到一百五十万吨。这个远景数字是波兰冶金工业设计局在制订关于波兰冶金工业的远景规划中确定的。远景规划并规定增加钢产量的主要方法之一将是改建现有的炼钢炉，使它符合现代技术的要求。为此在这段期间内将在波兰十三个冶金联合企业内进行改建炼钢炉，使之成为现代化的庞大工程。
