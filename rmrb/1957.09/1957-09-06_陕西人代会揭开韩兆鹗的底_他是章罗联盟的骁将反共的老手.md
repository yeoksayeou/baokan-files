Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, September 5th: Han Zhao'e, a fierce general of the Zhang Bojun-Luo Longji alliance, has had his anti-communist and anti-socialist crimes further exposed by representatives with conclusive facts at the fifth session of the first Shaanxi Provincial People's Congress, which is currently being held.

Han Zhao'e is the Vice Governor of Shaanxi Province, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, and the person in charge of the Shaanxi Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. Representatives revealed that after Han Zhao'e joined the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in 1941, he had been constantly mixed up with Zhang Bojun from Chongqing to Shanghai, and from Shanghai to Hong Kong. When Zhang was engaged in reactionary activities such as "dividing the world into three parts" and forming a "military committee" in Hong Kong, Han actively participated in offering suggestions. After the national liberation, Han's relationship with Zhang and Luo became even closer. When the Zhang-Luo alliance began to be exposed in June this year, Han even openly proposed to set up a "inspection group" in Beijing for Zhang Bojun's own use, attempting to exonerate Zhang Bojun. This shows to what extent Han Zhao'e was loyal to his "Lord" (Han often referred to Zhang Bojun in this way in front of people).

In order to faithfully implement Zhang Bojun's evil "major development" policy, Han Zhao'e openly proposed to "unite the backward, win over the middle, and attack the progressive." He also said that the development of the organization should "not be afraid of ideological backwardness, and not be afraid of unclear history." According to investigations, among the 97 members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party developed in 14 units in the health sector alone, those who belonged to reactionary parties and groups, had unclear political history, landlords, rich peasants, capitalists, and relatives who were sentenced and detained, and were dissatisfied with the Communist Party, accounted for 76% of the total members. When the Zhang-Luo alliance had been exposed, some members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party asked him what to do, Han said: "It is easier to handle affairs and activities after the establishment (referring to the Shaanxi Provincial Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party)," and "Even if Zhang Bojun falls, we must also build an independent kingdom in Shaanxi!" Now, under the questioning of the people's representatives, Han Zhao'e admitted that his purpose of vigorously recruiting troops and buying horses was to expand the power of Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji and himself as political capital.

According to the people's representatives, Han Zhao'e also used his position as Vice Governor and Chairman of the Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League to fan the flames in Hu County, Mei County, Fufeng, and Qishan under the name of "inspection" during the great blooming and contending, and sent his cronies to Hanzhong to stir up trouble. Han Zhao'e instigated at the meeting of all township heads and CCP township branch secretaries in Hu County, saying: "Don't have any concerns about the great blooming and contending, don't be afraid, especially don't be afraid of veteran cadres. Look at the stone lions in the City God Temple in Xi'an. Although they are old, they are of no use at all." He incited the person in charge of the China Democratic League branch at the Northwest Agricultural College, saying: "Don't be afraid, just let them speak out, I will support you; you support the members of the league in the school." Under Han Zhao'e's instigation, some teachers and students from universities and middle schools such as Northwest Agricultural College, Mei County Middle School, and Mei County Forestry School frantically attacked the Communist Party.

The representatives also revealed Han Zhao'e's crime of consistently sheltering and condoning counter-revolutionary elements by using his position as Vice Governor. According to incomplete statistics, Han Zhao'e introduced more than 30 people with unclear political backgrounds and counter-revolutionary elements to work in these years in his personal name.

The people's representatives also cited many conclusive and reliable materials to peel off Han Zhao'e's disguise as a "progressive person." In 1936, when Han was the puppet County Chief of Chang'an County, a local farmer, Wang Zixin, organized farmers to join the Red Army stationed nearby. At this time, Han Zhao'e not only ordered the dispersal of this newly formed youth Red Army, but also threw Wang Zixin into prison. Han Zhao'e also jointly interrogated underground CCP members Zhang Hu and Wu Si'nv with the puppet Xianyang and Hu County chiefs. In order to obtain "evidence," Han Zhao'e instructed others to fabricate charges and put them in prison.

    陕西人代会揭开韩兆鹗的底
    他是章罗联盟的骁将反共的老手
    据新华社西安5日电　章伯钧—罗隆基联盟骁将韩兆鹗的反共反社会主义罪行，在正在举行的陕西省第一届人民代表大会第五次会议上被代表们用确凿的事实进一步揭露出来。
    韩兆鹗是陕西省副省长、民主同盟陕西省委主任委员，农工民主党陕西省筹备委员会负责人。代表们揭露，韩兆鹗1941年加入中国农工民主党后，从重庆到上海、从上海到香港一直和章伯钧厮混在一起，章在香港搞“三分天下”、“军事委员会”等反动活动时，韩就积极参加献策。全国解放后韩和章、罗关系更为密切。今年6月章罗联盟开始败露，韩还公然提出要在北京搞一个为章伯钧御用的“检查组”，企图为章伯钧开脱罪责。由此可见韩兆鹗对他的“吾的主”（韩常在人面前这样称章伯钧）效忠到什么程度。
    韩兆鹗为了忠实地执行了章伯钧恶性“大发展”的方针，竟公然提出要“团结落后，争取中间，打击进步。”还说发展组织要“不怕思想落后，不怕历史不清”。据调查，仅卫生界十四个单位所发展的九十七个农工民主党的成员中，属于反动党团、政治历史不清、地主、富农、资本家以及亲属被判刑、管押因而对共产党不满的人等，就占成员总数的76％。当章罗联盟已被揭露，一些农工民主党的成员问他该怎么办时，韩说：“成立了（指农工民主党陕西省筹委会）好办事，好活动”，“章伯钧就是垮了，咱也要在陕西搞个独立王国！”现在，韩兆鹗在人民代表们的责问下，承认他大肆招兵买马的目的是想为章伯钧、罗隆基和他本人扩充势力，作为政治资本。
    据人民代表们揭露，韩兆鹗还利用副省长和民盟省委主任委员的身份，在大鸣大放中借“巡视”工作的名义，先后赶到?厔、郿县、扶风、岐山等地煽风点火，还派他的亲信到汉中去点火。韩兆鹗在?厔全县的乡长、中共乡支部书记会议上大肆煽动地说：“对大鸣大放不要有顾虑，不要怕，特别不要怕老干部，你们看西安城隍庙的石狮子虽老，但没一点用场。”他在西北农学院对民盟支部负责人煽动说：“不要怕，尽管鸣放，我给你拍腔子（支持）；你给学校盟员拍腔子。”在韩兆鹗的煽动下，西北农学院、郿县中学、郿县林校等大、中学的一些教师和学生果然疯狂地向共产党进攻。
    代表们还揭露了韩兆鹗利用副省长职位一贯包庇、纵容反革命分子的罪行。据不完全统计，韩兆鹗在这几年当中，以他私人名义就给三十多个政治面貌不清的人和反革命分子介绍了工作。
    人民代表们还举出许多确凿可靠的材料，剥开了韩兆鹗这个“进步人士”的外衣。1936年韩做伪长安县长时，当地农民王子信曾组织农民参加驻在附近的红军，这时韩兆鹗不但下令打散这批新组成的青年红军，还把王子信抛入监狱。韩兆鹗还会同伪咸阳、鄠县县长一起审讯中共地下党员张祜、吴四女。韩兆鹗为了取得“罪证”，曾指示别人捏造罪状，把他们关入监狱。
