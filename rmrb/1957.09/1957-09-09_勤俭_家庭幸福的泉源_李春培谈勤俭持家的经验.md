Thrift and Diligence—The Source of Family Happiness
——Li Chunpei Talks About Her Experience in Managing a Household
By Our Reporter Zhang Wei

Li Chunpei’s family has nine members. Although the income is not very high, the family life is well-arranged. The year before last, her husband, Zhang Zhenduo, had a total monthly income of eighty-eight yuan. After deducting rent, water and electricity, living expenses for his wife and eldest child who lived elsewhere, and money sent to his mother and sister-in-law, only forty-five yuan was left each month for the seven people at home. As a housewife, how did she arrange her life?

When I asked her this question, she smiled modestly and replied, "Each month after I get the money, I divide it in half. I deposit half in the bank, and use the other half to buy rice, flour, firewood, coal, oil, and salt for the first half of the month. With the remaining money, I spend about 30 cents a day on vegetables, trying to buy nutritious vegetables like potatoes and tofu. I cook them well, so the children like to eat them and grow up healthy. On Sundays when my husband comes home, I spend a yuan on groceries. In this way, the monthly food expenses are less than forty yuan. After the wage reform last year, my husband’s salary increased to one hundred and seventeen yuan. I used the back pay to buy essential clothing for each member of the family, and increased the daily vegetable money to fifty cents. This way, there was still a surplus of four yuan each month. By the end of last year, I had saved more than fifty yuan for the children's school expenses. In addition, my husband and I bought thirty-five yuan in government bonds.”

"In terms of clothing, my husband wore a cotton coat for three winters. I took it apart, washed it, turned it inside out, and made it into a cotton suit for the eldest child, who wore it for another two winters. When the children's shoes are worn out, I tear off the uppers to make shoe linings, and I pull the threads from the worn socks to make rope to sew the soles of shoes. I have never wasted a scrap of cloth. Therefore, when the cloth ration coupons for May to August were issued this year, I voluntarily took three zhang and two chi less.”

"What power enables you to persist in doing this for a long time?" I further asked her.

"This has to be told from the beginning," she thought for a while and said. "Before liberation, my husband was a small clerk with a very low income. At that time, we already had seven people in our family, and we were often worried about food and clothing. After liberation, my husband's job was guaranteed and his income increased. However, the number of children increased from four to six, and the economic situation was not easy. But unlike before liberation, I, as a housewife, participated in various political activities and began to understand the principle of women standing up to be masters of their own affairs. The Women's Federation often educated us on diligence and thrift, and specifically helped me learn how to live within my means and spend according to a plan. Therefore, I always try my best to balance the family's income and expenditure. Because our life is well arranged, my husband’s work enthusiasm has always been very full. He now works at the Wuhan Branch of the People's Bank and has won three awards. He gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. I have also been re-elected for two terms as a district people's representative, elected as the city's third labor model, and still a “Five-Good” activist, and received awards.

"Running a thrifty household cannot rely on me alone. My husband and I usually pay attention to educating our children, so that they all understand the benefits of diligence and thrift. The eighteen-year-old eldest child, Ruitai, is studying at a normal school. I give him two yuan of pocket money each month. He deposits the money in the bank and takes out as much as he needs. Each month he can save a few jiao to a yuan. He has already saved more than four yuan. A few days ago, he told me: ‘I have money to buy books and notebooks when school starts this year, so don’t buy them for me, Mom.’ In June of this year, I was sick and hospitalized. The family's financial power had to be handed over to the twelve-year-old third child, Yuantai. After I was discharged from the hospital, the third child hurriedly took out his account book to report to me. The accounts for each day were written clearly, and he calculated carefully everywhere."

This year, my husband and I decided to spend only ten yuan for the Spring Festival. We held a family meeting and drew up a plan for spending the Spring Festival at the meeting. As a result, the whole family watched movies, watched dramas, and visited the People's Amusement Park during the Spring Festival. I made dumplings, buns, and the dishes everyone liked, sweet glutinous rice porridge, etc. As a result, ten yuan was not used up.

When the reporter visited Li Chunpei, she was altering a qipao at home, preparing to wear it when she went to Beijing to attend the National Women's Congress. She also told me: “My husband insisted that I make a new dress to go to Beijing. At first, I also felt that I could make one, but when I thought about it, I felt it was a bit of a waste. In the end, I decided to alter the qipao I made last year. Look, isn’t it good?" (Attached picture)

    勤俭——家庭幸福的泉源
    ——李春培谈勤俭持家的经验
    本报记者　张碨
    李春培一家有九口人，收入虽然不很多，但家庭生活安排得很好。前年，她丈夫张振铎每月全部收入共八十八元。除了房租水电，爱人、大孩子在外的生活费用和寄给婆婆、嫂嫂的钱外，每月只剩下四十五元供家里七口人生活。作为家庭主妇，她是怎样来安排生活的呢？
    当我向她提出这个问题的时候，她谦虚的笑了笑，回答说：每个月我拿到钱后，就分为两半，一半存入银行，用一半将上半个月的米面、柴煤、油盐买齐，剩下的每天花三角菜钱，尽量买些洋芋、豆腐等有营养的菜，把味道做好些，孩子们爱吃，身体也长的好。星期天爱人回来，就花一块钱买菜。这样，每月伙食还花不到四十元。去年工资改革以后，我爱人的薪金增加到一百一十七元。我把补发的薪金用来为全家每人添置了必需的衣物，每天的菜金增加到五角，这样，每月还余下四元，到去年年底共积蓄了五十多元作孩子们上学的费用，另外，我和爱人还买了三十五元公债。
    “在穿衣方面，我爱人一身棉衣穿了三个冬天，我把它拆洗翻面给大孩子改成一套棉衣，他又穿了两个冬天。孩子们穿破了的鞋子，我把鞋帮撕下来糊鞋衬，把破袜子的线抽下来捻成绳子纳鞋底，一点破布也没有浪费过。因此，发今年5至8月的布票时，自动少领了三丈二尺布票。”
    “什么力量使你能长期坚持这样做呢？”我进一步问她。
    “这就得从头说起啦。”她想了想说。“解放前，我爱人是一名小职员，收入很少，那时我们家已有七口人，经常是愁吃、愁穿。解放后，我丈夫的工作有了保障，收入也增加了。但孩子却由四个增加到六个，经济情况也不宽裕。可是和解放前不同的是我这个家庭妇女参加了各种政治活动，开始懂得了妇女翻身做主人的道理。妇联会经常教育我们勤俭节约，具体帮助我学会怎样量入为出，按计划开支。所以，我总想尽一切办法使家里收支平衡。由于我们的生活安排好了，我爱人的工作情绪一直都很饱满，他现在人民银行武汉分行工作，得过三次奖，光荣地参加了中国共产党。我也连任了两届区人民代表，当选为全市第三届劳动模范，还是“五好”积极分子，受到了奖励。
    “勤俭治家光靠我一个人是不行的。我和我爱人平时很注意教育孩子，使他们都懂得勤俭的好处。十八岁的大孩子瑞泰在读师范学校，我每月给他二元零用，他把钱存入银行，用多少取多少，每月都可以节约几角钱到一块钱。现在已存有四块多钱。前些天他告诉我说：
  ‘今年开学买书买本子我自己有钱，不要妈妈给钱买了。’今年6月，我生病住医院了。全家的经济大权只好交给十二岁的老三元泰掌握。我出院后，老三赶忙拿出他的账本来向我报账，每天的账目都写的清清楚楚的，并且处处精打细算。”
    今年春节，我和我爱人决定只花十块钱过节，我们开了次家庭会议，在会上订出了过春节的计划。结果，全家在春节期间，看了电影、看了戏，还游了民众乐园。我给大家做了饺子、包子和爱吃的菜、甜糯米稀饭等，结果十块钱没有用完。
    当记者访问李春培的时候，她正在家里改缝一件花旗袍，准备上北京参加全国妇代大会时穿。她还告诉我说：“我爱人一定要叫我做一件新衣服上北京。我开始也感到可以做一件，但一想又觉得有点浪费，最后，还是决定把去年做的旗袍改一改，你看，不是很好吗？”（附图片）
