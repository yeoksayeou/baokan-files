Budapest, September 24th (Special Dispatch by Our Correspondent) On the eve of the Hungarian government delegation's visit to China, our correspondent in Hungary interviewed Comrade János Kádár, Premier of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government. Comrade Kádár answered our reporter's questions regarding Hungary's political, economic, and cultural development, as well as the friendship between China and Hungary.

    Question: What is the current economic situation in Hungary? What achievements have been made, and what are the prospects for development?

    Answer: Our economic situation is improving faster than we initially estimated after the October counter-revolutionary events. For example, the total industrial output in August this year was only 3% lower than in August last year. Of course, the achievements of each industrial sector are not the same. To cite a few important figures: Coal production in August was 6% less than in the same period last year, but the overtime work used to achieve this production level was much less than in August last year. Our electricity production is exactly the same as before. The output of the metallurgical and machinery industries is also approaching last year's level. Regarding agriculture, grain production is much higher than last year. As of August 31, grain harvests were 150,000 tons more than in the same period last year, and feed harvests were 430,000 tons more than in the same period last year. The retail trade volume in August 1957 was 10% higher than in August last year.

    However, I must add that several years of hard work are still needed to ensure the complete and smooth development of our economic life. The achievements we have made so far are not only due to the good work of our working class, working peasants, and intellectuals loyal to the people, as well as the firm economic policies of the Party and the government, but also to a large extent to the assistance of brotherly countries, especially the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

    As for our future economic plans, these plans serve two basic purposes: first, to ensure the construction of a socialist society without exploitation, and second, to improve the living standards of the working people by continuously developing the productive forces. This naturally requires realistic plans that not only pay special attention to the viewpoint of thrift but also use material incentives to promote the realization of the above goals. We should pay attention to these viewpoints when determining the goals of socialist industrialization and agricultural development.

    Question: How do you assess the achievements in the struggle against counter-revolution and the strengthening of the dictatorship of the proletariat? How is the Party's February resolution on opposing revisionism and right-leaning tendencies being implemented?

    Answer: The basic achievements in the struggle against counter-revolution and the strengthening of the dictatorship of the proletariat are: Today in Hungary, political power is no longer in the hands of the counter-revolutionaries. The people's power organs, judicial organs, and armed forces have all been reorganized. As mentioned above, we have made achievements in restoring production. Our cultural, educational, and scientific organs are working with increasing effectiveness, which is also our achievement. Among the achievements, I would especially like to mention the re-organization of the Party, the leading force and main fighting weapon of the Hungarian working class and the entire Hungarian people. Our membership is now smaller than that of the former Hungarian Workers' Party, with 380,000 members, more than half of whom are workers. Our Party is carrying out its duties, leading the people, and guiding the construction of socialist society.

    We have been able to achieve these results more quickly because of the following three factors: First, the Party's correct and firm Marxist-Leninist line; second, the trust and support of the working class and the working masses; and third, the assistance of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the entire socialist camp, and the international workers' movement.

    Of course, we cannot be complacent in the slightest. The cause of the socialist revolution has triumphed in our country, but this victory still needs to be defended. The remnants of the enemy still exist, and imperialism continues to provoke and attack. Therefore, it is still necessary to resolutely struggle against counter-revolutionary forces. The condition for winning this struggle is to thoroughly eliminate the remnants of right-leaning views within the Party and the remnants of the policy of compromise with the enemy resulting from them.

    Regarding the basic principles of the struggle against the enemy, we believe that those who are guilty must be punished. As for some counter-revolutionaries who, although there is no evidence of their crimes, their behavior shows that they would commit crimes at any time given the opportunity, they should still be strictly restricted. However, we do not punish those who have been deceived, but rather help them get back on the right path. We believe that a very important part of the struggle against the enemy is to politically isolate the enemy and strive to use the weapons of ideological struggle and persuasion in the struggle.

    Question: In your opinion, what developments have taken place in the friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people in the past year?

    Answer: In the past year, the friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people has developed further and become closer and more sincere. There is a Hungarian saying: "A friend in need is a friend indeed." When we were in a critical situation, the large-scale assistance given to us by the Chinese people, in addition to the Soviet Union, deeply moved every honest Hungarian. When Comrades Zhu De and Zhou Enlai visited Budapest one after another, they could feel the fraternal feelings of our working people towards the People's Republic of China. Other Chinese comrades who visited various parts of our country after the counter-revolutionary events could also feel this. I hope that this visit by our government delegation to China will also help further develop the friendship between the two peoples.

    When I talk about the help the Chinese people have given us, I naturally refer not only to material help. The theoretical and practical work of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, as well as the experience that we can use in our own situation, also means immeasurable help in our struggle against counter-revolutionary forces, the consolidation of the situation, and the restoration of normal life. In the future, we also expect to receive help from this valuable experience.

    I would like to take this opportunity to extend warm congratulations to the working people of the People's Republic of China.

    卡达尔总理答本报记者问
    匈牙利的经济情况已经迅速获得改善
    一年来中匈人民的友谊变得更加亲密
    本报布达佩斯24日电　在匈牙利政府代表团访问中国的前夕，本报驻匈牙利记者特访问了匈牙利工农革命政府总理卡达尔·亚诺什同志，卡达尔同志就本报记者提出的有关匈牙利政治、经济、文化发展和中匈友谊等问题，作了答复。
    问：目前匈牙利的经济情况如何，已获得了哪些成就，发展远景怎样？
    答：我们的经济情况改善的速度超过了我们在十月反革命事件后最初的估计。例如，今年8月份的工业总产量仅比去年8月份低3％。当然每个工业部门所达到的成就并不是一样的。举几个较重要的数字：8月份的煤产量比去年同期少6％，但达到这一生产水平所用的超时工作，比去年8月份少得多。我们生产的电力与以前恰相等。冶金和机器工业的产量也接近了去年的水平。关于农业方面，粮食的产量比去年高得多，到8月31日为止粮食的收获量比去年同期多十五万吨，饲料的收获量比去年同期多四十三万吨。1957年8月份的零售贸易额，比去年8月多10％。
    但我必须补充说明，为了要使我们的经济生活能够完全顺利地发展，还需要几年的艰苦工作。我们至今所获得的成就，除了应归功于我们的工人阶级、劳动农民和忠于人民的知识分子的良好的工作以及党和政府的坚定的经济政策以外，在很大程度上还应该归功于兄弟国家的帮助，首先是苏联和中华人民共和国的帮助。
    至于我们今后的经济计划，这种计划是为两个基本目的服务的，首先是要保证没有剥削的社会主义社会的建设，同时通过不断发展生产力的方法，提高劳动人民的生活水平。这自然就需要现实的计划，不仅要特别注意节约观点，而且要用物质鼓励来促进上述目标的实现。我们在确定社会主义工业化和发展农业的目标时，要注意这些观点。
    问：您怎样估价对反革命的斗争及加强无产阶级专政方面的成就，党在2月所作的关于反修正主义及反右倾的决议执行情况如何？
    答：对反革命的斗争及加强无产阶级专政方面的基本成就是：今天在匈牙利，政权已经不是掌握在反革命的手中了，人民政权机关、司法机关和武装力量都进行了改组。上面已经谈过，我们在恢复生产上是有成就的。我们的文化、教育和科学机关在日益有效地进行着工作，这也是我们的成就。在成就中，我还要特别提出匈牙利工人阶级和全体匈牙利人民的领导力量和主要战斗武器——党的重新组织，我们党员数目现在比过去劳动人民党的党员少，现在有三十八万党员，党员的半数以上是工人。我们的党在执行着自己的职务，领导着人民并指导着社会主义社会的建设工作。
    我们能够较快地达到这些成就，是因为下面三个因素：一，党的正确的坚定的马克思列宁主义路线；二，工人阶级和劳动群众的信任与支持；三，苏联、中华人民共和国、整个社会主义阵营以及国际工人运动的援助。
    自然我们一点也不能自满，社会主义革命的事业在我国获得了胜利，但这个胜利尚需加以保卫。敌人的残余还存在着，帝国主义还在继续挑衅和进攻。因此，还需要坚决地对反革命力量进行斗争。这个争取斗争胜利的条件是要在党内彻底清除右倾观点的残余及由此而产生的对敌人妥协的政策的残余。
    关于对敌人斗争的基本原则，我们认为，有罪者必须惩办；至于有些反革命分子，虽然尚无罪证，但其表现说明，只要一有机会他们随时都会犯罪，对他们仍应该严加限制。但是，对那些被欺骗了的人们，我们不惩办他们，而是要帮助他们重新走上正路。我们认为，对敌人斗争的一个很重要的部分，是在政治上孤立敌人，并力求在斗争中采用思想斗争和说服的武器。
    问：您认为中匈两国人民友谊一年来有了哪些发展？
    答：一年来中匈人民的友谊更进一步发展了，变得更加亲密和真诚了，匈牙利有一句成语“患难见朋友”。当我们处在危急情况的时候，除了苏联以外，中国人民给予我们的大规模援助，使每一个正直的匈牙利人都深为感谢。朱德同志和周恩来同志先后在访问布达佩斯时，可以感受到我国劳动人民对中华人民共和国的兄弟般的感情。反革命事件以后来到我国各地访问的其他中国同志们，也能感受到这点。我希望我国政府代表团这次到中国访问也将有助于两国人民友谊的进一步发展。
    当我谈到中国人民给我们的帮助时，自然我所指的不仅是物质上的帮助，中国共产党和毛泽东同志的理论和实际工作以及那些我们能够在我国情况下加以利用的经验，在我们对反革命力量的斗争中、形势的巩固中、正常生活的恢复中，也意味着不可估量的帮助。今后，我们也指望能得到这种宝贵经验的帮助。
    我借此机会向中华人民共和国的劳动人民致以热烈的祝贺。
