　　Who is Liao Bingxiong satirizing?
　　Cartoonist Liao Bingxiong published many cartoons in the "Cartoon" semi-monthly, maliciously attacking the Party's leadership over literary and art work. Now, Liao Bingxiong's rightist words and deeds have been further exposed and have been severely criticized.
　　In the two groups of "ditty paintings" published in the "Cartoon" semi-monthly – "Presented to the Gentlemen of Dogmatism" – under the pretext of opposing dogmatism, he launched venomous attacks against the Party. In this set of paintings, one depicts a robot painting (see "Cartoon" No. 92), which fully demonstrates how Liao Bingxiong distorted facts and maliciously attacked the Party. He cursed the Party's leadership, sarcastically saying, "You are a painter, I am an official," and "It is best for people to be like machines." The "Thousand-Hand Guanyin" published in the "Cartoon" semi-monthly No. 67 has extremely venomous implications. The author smears the leaders of some state work departments as shameless people who steal fame and usurp honor, openly rob the fruits of the masses' labor, and are despicable, greedy, and ugly clowns, maliciously provoking the relationship between the masses and the leaders.
　　Liao Bingxiong's "Lazybones Factory," published on the back cover of the "Cartoon" semi-monthly No. 85, depicts a worker who "lies down to work when the sun is high in the sky," "works all day, only pressing this one button" (working only by pressing a button with his finger all day), and "spends the rest of the time watching and playing" (playing cards). Yet, this "lazy person" in the "Lazybones Factory" "wins awards every month, gaining both fame and fortune," receiving a large salary and a huge bonus, and even wearing a big red flower, being listed on the honor roll. Such an absurd and purposeful fabrication has no basis in reality and maliciously slanders the working class. Aren't the bourgeois rightists clamoring everywhere that "workers live in the ninth heaven" and "peasants live close to the brink of starvation"? Doesn't this "Lazybones Factory" perfectly illustrate the rightist fallacies?
　　In his actual work, Liao Bingxiong also regarded being able to break away from the Party's leadership as a pleasure, attempting to act arbitrarily and do as he pleased. When organizing the exhibition of cartoons to eliminate the "three evils," he advocated that it was not necessary to inform the Party committee or to hold a preview to solicit the Party committee's opinions, but just to exhibit the cartoons after they were created. After the news that a Guangzhou evening newspaper was about to be launched spread, Liao Bingxiong declared that he would strive to have the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee's Department of Culture and Education allocate a certain amount of space in the evening newspaper for him to edit a cartoon supplement, and that the text and illustrations in this supplement should not be subject to the newspaper's editorial department's review. The so-called "no review by the editorial department" is synonymous with "no Party leadership."
　　Liao Bingxiong's mistakes are serious, and his mistakes have caused losses to the cause of the Party and the people. Therefore, Guangzhou art circles have subjected him to serious criticism, and Liao Bingxiong has also made self-criticisms.

### 廖冰兄在讽刺谁？

　　廖冰兄在讽刺谁？
    漫画家廖冰兄在“漫画”半月刊中发表了不少漫画，向党对文艺工作的领导进行了恶意的攻击。现在，廖冰兄的右派言行已被进一步揭露出来，并遭到严正的批驳。
    在“漫画”半月刊上发表的两组“打油词画”——“赠教条主义诸公”中，借口反对教条主义，对党进行了刻毒的攻讦。在这组画里，有一幅画的是捺机器人作画，（见“漫画”第九十二期）就充分表明了廖冰兄是怎样歪曲事实恶意向党进攻。他漫骂党的领导，讽刺说：“尔为画匠我为官”，说“最好人如机器”。发表在“漫画”半月刊六十七期的“千手观音”寓意极为刻毒。作者把某些国家工作部门的领导人涂抹成盗名窃誉、明目张胆地抢夺群众劳动成果、卑鄙贪功、形象丑恶的小丑，恶意地挑拨了群众与领导者的关系。
    廖冰兄发表于“漫画”半月刊八十五期封底的“懒人工厂”，画着一个工人“日上三竿，躺着上班”，“整天工作，只此一按”（一天工作不过是用手指按一按电钮而已），“其余时间，看看玩玩”（大打其扑克），就是这样“懒人工厂”的“懒人”，竟“月月得奖，名利双全”，既领了大笔工资，又获得了巨额奖金，还戴上了大红花，名列光荣榜。这样荒谬绝伦的别有用心的捏造，找不到一点儿现实的根据，对工人阶级进行了恶意的污蔑。资产阶级右派分子正是到处叫嚣说“工人生活在九天之上”，“农民生活接近饿死边缘”，这幅“懒人工厂”，不正好给右派谬论作了插图吗？
    廖冰兄在实际工作中也以能摆脱党的领导为快事，企图独断独行，为所欲为。他在组织清除“三害”漫画展览的时候，就主张可以不必给党委知道，也不必先举行预展听取党委意见，只要搞出来了便展出去。广州即将创办晚报消息传出后，廖冰兄便声言要向广东省委文教部争取将晚报划出一定的篇幅由他来编漫画副刊，这副刊的文画不要报纸编辑部过问。所谓不要编辑部过问，也即是不要党的领导的同义语。
    廖冰兄的错误是严重的，他的错误已使党和人民的事业蒙受了损失。因此，广州美术界人士对他进行了严肃的批评，廖冰兄也曾作了检讨。
