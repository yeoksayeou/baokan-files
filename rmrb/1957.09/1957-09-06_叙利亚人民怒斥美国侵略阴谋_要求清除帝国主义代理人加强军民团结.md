Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, September 5th: Residents of the Al-Aklrad district of Damascus, the Syrian capital, held a mass rally on September 4th. They passed a letter to the Parliament, the Cabinet, and the Army Command, expressing their extreme indignation at the recent U.S. conspiracy, demanding the elimination of imperialist agents, and paying tribute to the Army for thwarting the U.S. conspiracy.

Approximately seven hundred people attended the rally. Syrian trade union leader Ibrahim Bakri, renowned writer Mawab Karyali, and renowned poet Mohammed Hariri all delivered speeches at the rally, exposing the imperialist conspiracies against Syria over the past twelve years, and particularly condemning the recent U.S.-orchestrated conspiracy in Syria.

They pointed out that the Arab nation, with the support of the socialist camp and peace-loving people around the world, will shatter all imperialist conspiracies, aggression plans, military treaties, and the "Eisenhower Doctrine." They also refuted the notion of "communist infiltration" and welcomed the recent Syrian-Soviet economic talks. The audience responded with enthusiastic applause and shouted patriotic slogans, hailing the friendship between Arab countries and the Soviet Union and China.

Speakers at the rally also called for unity between the army and the people, to remain vigilant, and to repel any new conspiracies planned by U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson during his recent trip to the Middle East.

After the rally, a demonstration was held. It is reported that mass rallies will also be held in other districts of Damascus in the coming days.
