Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 6th: According to statistics from forty-eight units, including the Gansu Provincial Department of Commerce, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Urban Construction Bureau, and Yongdeng Cement Plant, since the beginning of the anti-Rightist struggle, they have resolved more than 3,500 important problems raised by the masses concerning cadre work style, employee welfare, and professional work. Among them, the Lanzhou Railway Administration handled 868 cases, accounting for 77.5% of the opinions raised by the masses.

    The leadership style of the Gansu provincial-level agencies has improved. Leading cadres of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Committee have organized working groups to go deep into the grassroots to understand the situation when dealing with many major issues, or they personally go to the site to solve problems on the spot. The Gansu Provincial Urban Construction Bureau has established a system for leading cadres to visit the homes of employees during their spare time or holidays. The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League decided that leading cadres should spend a quarter to half of the year going to the countryside, factories, and schools to directly meet with the masses, and inspect and guide the work of grassroots CYL organizations. The 641 Team of the Gansu Geological Bureau stipulates that cadres above the section level should spend half of their time each year working in the work area. The Gansu Provincial Personnel Bureau and other units have also stipulated that bureau chiefs and section chiefs should take time to personally receive visiting members of the public. In addition, ten units including the Gansu Provincial Grain Bureau and the Public Security Bureau have allocated more than 500 rooms, solving the housing problems for more than 400 households, totaling more than 1,800 people.

    甘肃四十八个单位已解决三千多个问题
    据新华社兰州6日电　据甘肃省商业厅、农林厅、城市建设局、永登水泥厂等四十八个单位的统计，反右派斗争开始以来，已经解决了群众提出的有关干部作风、职工生活福利、业务工作等方面的重要问题三千五百多件。其中兰州铁路管理局就处理了八百六十八件，占群众所提意见的77.5％。
    甘肃省级机关的领导作风已经有了改进。中共甘肃省委和省人民委员会的领导干部，在处理许多重大问题时，都组织工作组，深入基层了解情况，或者亲自到现场就地解决问题。甘肃省城市建设局已经建立了领导干部业余时间或假日访问职工家庭的制度。共青团甘肃省委员会决定领导干部以全年四分之一到一半的时间，下乡、下厂、下学校，直接与群众见面，检查和指导共青团基层组织的工作。甘肃地质局六四一队规定科级以上干部每年要抽一半的时间深入工区工作。甘肃省人事局等单位还规定了局长、科长抽出一定时间亲自接见来访群众的制度。另外，甘肃省粮食厅、公安厅等十个单位共调剂出住房五百多间，解决了四百多户共一千八百多人的住房问题。
