    Who is Most Sensitive to the Truth
    Yi Huai
    When discussing how intellectuals should pass the socialist test, someone proposed this view: "Intellectuals are most sensitive to the truth," and one should not be disappointed or lose confidence in the "passing" of intellectuals. For the sake of socialism, everyone hopes that intellectuals can smoothly pass this "test." However, if the sensitivity of intellectuals to the truth is used as a basis for their easy passage, it is worth considering.

    Let's look at the facts: When the rightists were frantically attacking the Party and socialism, who was the first to stand up to defend the Party and socialism? In early June, when workers in Beijing and other places stepped forward to speak out, they immediately exposed the anti-Party and anti-socialist essence of the fallacies of Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Chu Anping and their ilk, and gave them a head-on blow. And what about the intellectuals? Many people described the rightists' challenge to the Party and the people as "inappropriate wording" and "bad personality." Their "motives" were still good, and the mistakes were nothing more than "deliberately startling," "alarmist," and "pandering to the public." Moreover, they disapproved of the just counterattack by workers, peasants, and others who defended socialism against the rightists, saying it was a "siege" of those who offered opinions, and blaming the Communist Party for being "narrow-minded"... Why are many intellectuals far less sensitive to the truth of "socialism" than ordinary workers and peasants? Obviously, this is not a matter of knowledge but a matter of stance.

    Many intellectuals often dislike hearing the word "stance," especially when it is linked to "truth." However, the problem lies precisely here. When you still harbor capitalist ideas, or even have some nostalgia for capitalism, no matter how high your knowledge is, you cannot possibly be sensitive to the truth of socialism. Your sensitivity is completely the opposite: many things in socialism often make you unaccustomed or even dissatisfied, and the calls to revive the ghost of the bourgeoisie often quickly find a response in you. When the rightists frantically attacked the Party, wasn't this the case? The reason why ordinary workers and peasants were so sensitive to the rightists' attacks was precisely because they were firmly standing on the socialist stance, so that any conspiracies and tricks against the Party and socialism could not escape their eyes. Some intellectuals often say that the eyes of the masses are bright, but their own eyes are not, and that is the reason.

    We do not belittle knowledge; knowledge is our tool for exploring the truth. However, only when intellectuals shift their stance to the side of the working class will their knowledge make them sensitive to the truth of socialism. The leftists among the intellectuals are a good example. Since passing the socialist test is essentially a matter of changing one's stance for intellectuals, emphasizing the role of knowledge at this time will easily lead people to evade the issue of stance, thereby increasing resistance to "passing the test," isn't it?

    谁对真理最敏感
    易槐
    在谈到知识分子怎样过社会主义这一关的时候，有人提出了这样的看法：“知识分子对真理最敏感”，不应该对知识分子的“过关”表示失望或没有信心。为了社会主义，谁都希望知识分子能够顺利地过好这一“关”。可是，如果用知识分子对真理最敏感作为知识分子容易过关的根据，那就是值得考虑的了。
    让我们看一看事实吧：当右派分子向党向社会主义猖狂进攻的时候，是谁首先挺身而出保卫党保卫社会主义的？六月初，北京和其他各地的工人一站出来讲话，立即就揭穿了章伯钧、罗隆基、储安平之流的谬论的反共反社会主义实质，迎头给以痛击。而知识分子们呢？很多人却把右派分子向党向人民的挑战说成是什么“用辞不当”、“个性不好”，他们的“动机”还是好的，错误也不过是“故作惊人之笔”、“危言耸听”、“哗众取宠”而已，而且，对工人农民以及其他维护社会主义的人向右派分子的正义的反击很不以为然，说这是对提意见者的“围剿”，责备共产党“气量狭小”……。为什么许多知识分子在“社会主义”这一真理面前，远远不如普通工人和农民敏感呢？很明显的，这不是知识问题而是立场问题。
    不少知识分子常常不爱听“立场”二字，特别是不喜欢把“立场”和“真理”联系起来。可是，问题恰恰就发生在这里。当你还存在着资本主义思想，甚至对资本主义还有所留恋，不管你的知识有多高，你对社会主义的真理是不可能有任何敏感的。你的敏感是完全相反的：社会主义的许多东西常常使你不习惯甚至不满意，为资产阶级招魂的呼声，往往在你这里很快地得到呼应，当右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候，情况不正是如此吗？普通的工人、农民所以能够对右派分子的进攻那么敏感，不也正是因为他们是牢牢地站在社会主义的立场上，以致任何反对党反对社会主义的阴谋诡计也逃不脱他们的眼睛。有些知识分子常说群众的眼睛亮，自己的眼睛不亮，道理也就在这里。
    我们并不菲薄知识，知识是我们探索真理的工具。可是，知识分子只有把自己的立场转到工人阶级方面，他们的知识才会使他们对社会主义的真理敏感起来。知识分子中的左派就是很好的榜样。既然过社会主义关对于知识分子说，本来就是改变立场问题。这时候又要去强调知识的作用，这岂不容易使人回避立场问题，给“过关”增加阻力吗？
