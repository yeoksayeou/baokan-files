    We Must Pay Attention to the Work of Collective Mess Halls in Saving Grain

    The personnel who eat in the collective mess halls of government offices, organizations, schools, and enterprises are all organized; in principle, the work of saving grain here should be easy to do. However, many cities have discovered excessive grain consumption and waste of grain in the collective mess halls of government offices, organizations, enterprises, and schools during the rectification of grain unified purchase and supply work. This is very abnormal. In large and medium-sized cities, the number of people participating in collective mess halls generally accounts for about 30% of the total urban grain consumers, and in some cities it is more than 40%; they are the advanced part of the urban residents. Therefore, advocating saving grain in collective mess halls will not only greatly reduce the sales volume of grain in cities, but also promote other urban residents to save grain.

    One of the most important reasons for the serious waste of grain in some collective mess halls is that the leading cadres of these units adopt an attitude of indifference to this issue. They believe that the grain issue is "not a big deal" and fear that getting involved in such matters will lead to "事務主義 (事務主義)". Here, we will not dwell on the great significance of saving grain for the country's socialist construction and for consolidating the worker-peasant alliance; from these perspectives, the view that it is "not a big deal" is of course wrong. We only need to consider that wasting or saving grain is related to the quality of the collective mess hall and the lives of the vast number of workers and students who participate in it. Then, being concerned about the grain consumption of the collective mess hall is not "事務主義 (事務主義)" at all, but the attitude that a responsible worker should have. In the future, the country's grain work will be strengthened day by day, and the amount of grain supplied to various units will be gradually fixed. Under these circumstances, if the collective mess halls continue to waste grain, it will have a great impact on the lives of those who participate. Therefore, a leading cadre's concern for the collective mess hall of their unit and supervision of the staff in charge of the collective mess hall to properly implement the country's grain policy is a manifestation of concern for the lives of the masses and a duty they should fulfill. In order to gradually make saving grain a conscious action of the masses, the administrative leading cadres of each unit should repeatedly and thoroughly conduct propaganda and education for all staff, explaining the importance of abiding by the state's grain policy and saving grain, so that they deeply understand that doing so can further strengthen the relationship between the Party and the government and the people, which is conducive to the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance and the development of socialist construction.

    The management personnel of collective mess halls bear the direct responsibility of organizing all cooks to save grain. The quality of their work is directly related to saving or wasting grain and directly related to the quality of the collective mess hall. Some staff in charge of collective mess halls do not know the importance of their work responsibilities, do not properly study and implement the country's grain policy, and simply use the old methods of managing mess halls, purchasing and using grain from the perspective of their own work convenience and the convenience of their own mess hall. This approach is wrong. The administrative responsible cadres of each unit should often educate mess hall management personnel to save grain, and list the implementation of the state grain policy and saving grain as an important item for assessing their work performance.

    In order to run the collective mess halls well and save grain for the country, it is also necessary to rely on all the personnel participating in the mess halls to supervise the collective mess halls through certain means. Many workers and students believe that their relationship with the collective mess hall is only a consumer and supplier relationship, and as long as nothing affects personal consumption, they do not care about all the problems in mess hall management. This attitude is wrong. The reason why some collective mess halls have not seriously implemented the country's grain policy is precisely the result of losing mass supervision. Everyone participating in the collective mess hall should know that actively supervising the collective mess hall and implementing the country's grain policy can not only save grain consumption, but also reduce the cost of the mess hall and improve the lives of those participating in the collective mess hall. Therefore, everyone participating in the collective mess hall should, for the overall interests of the country and for their own vital interests, supervise the management personnel of the collective mess hall to run the mess hall well and save grain. Vice Premier Chen Yun called on the people of the country to save half an ounce of grain per person per day on the basis of normal consumption levels in his speech at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress. Personnel participating in collective mess halls should be the first to respond to this call and study and formulate their own plans for saving grain.

    Many collective mess halls lack planning in their operations, stick to old cooking methods, and do not know how to properly handle leftover food and store mess hall grain, which also wastes a lot of grain. Some staff in charge of collective mess halls believe that it is impossible to have a plan for cooking for hundreds of people, so some waste of grain is inevitable. But the actual situation is not like this. Some collective mess halls in Harbin, Shanghai, and other cities with thousands of people have eliminated the phenomenon of wasting grain after thorough rectification and implementation of planned management methods. These facts prove that whether collective mess halls can implement planned management does not depend on the size of the mess hall, but on the work attitude, work methods, and work style of the management personnel. After many collective mess halls have experimented with improving cooking methods to reduce grain loss and increase the rate of rice production, a lot of grain can be saved. The twenty-odd canteens of the Shenyang Railway Bureau saved more than 90,000 catties of rice and sorghum rice a year by changing to the method of cooking rice over low heat; the collective mess hall of Nanjing No. 8 Middle School implemented the "raw rice steaming method," saving more than 100 catties of rice every day. Despite the many benefits of these improvements, in the process of implementation, there will still be some ideological resistance. For example, some people object to changing to scientific cooking methods, citing the excuse that "rice without crust is not tasty." Some cooks are worried about not having experience and are worried about not cooking the rice well, and they also have doubts about changing the cooking methods. These ideological obstacles must be overcome through specific facts to promote various scientific cooking methods. Each collective mess hall should pay special attention to the cooks' rationalization proposals in improving cooking methods and saving grain, and actively help them overcome the difficulties encountered in the process of improving cooking methods.

    There are many loopholes in collective mess halls that waste grain. In order to plug these loopholes, we must seize every link that may waste grain. Big loopholes should be plugged, and small loopholes cannot be let go. Take cleaning empty flour sacks as an example. The amount of flour swept out of an empty flour sack is indeed limited, but collecting the flour from many empty flour sacks adds up to a lot. The cooks of Tianjin No. 4 State-Owned Cotton Textile Factory thoroughly sweep and brush empty flour sacks, saving more than 100 catties of flour in three months, which is not a small amount. Some loopholes in collective mess halls that waste grain have been exposed, but due to the obstruction of some people, they cannot be plugged for a while. For example, some hospitals clearly know that the phenomenon of wasting grain in their units is very serious, but they do not consider how to improve and refuse to correct the error of wasting grain. Such units must be severely criticized and ordered to change this situation within a time limit.

    Saving grain is a long-term matter. All collective mess halls that have already achieved success in saving grain should pay attention to consolidating the results of saving work and preventing the phenomenon of everything going back to the way it was after a "gust of wind" passes. The way to consolidate the results of saving work is to formulate various practical and feasible saving methods into a system, including the system of rewards and punishments for cooks saving or wasting grain.

    The departments in charge of leading grain saving work in some cities only care about working with the general residents and relax their leadership over collective mess halls. This approach is wrong. Although the personnel participating in collective mess halls are the advanced part of the urban residents, before they have thoroughly understood the great significance of saving grain, they will still have various incorrect views on saving grain work. Some people even think this is a "small matter," are careless, indifferent, and take a passive attitude. These people must be told to immediately correct their understanding. State personnel, workers, and students should play a leading and exemplary role in the urban grain saving movement.

### 必须重视集体伙食单位节约粮食的工作

    必须重视集体伙食单位节约粮食的工作
    在机关、团体、学校、企业的集体伙食单位中就食的人员，都是有组织的人员；这里的节约粮食的工作，照理应该容易做好。但是，许多城市在整顿粮食统销工作中，都发现机关、团体、企业、学校的集体伙食单位有用粮过多和浪费粮食的现象。这是很不正常的。大、中城市参加集体伙食的人员，一般约占城市全部粮食消费者的百分之三十左右，有的城市在百分之四十以上；他们是城市居民中的先进部分。因此，在集体伙食单位提倡节约粮食，不仅会使城市粮食销售量大为降低，而且可以推动其他城市居民节约粮食。
    某些集体伙食单位严重地浪费粮食，最重要的原因之一，是这些单位的领导干部对于这个问题采取不闻不问的态度。他们认为粮食问题“不是什么大事”，害怕过问这种事情会陷入“事务主义”。这里且不多说节约粮食对于国家的社会主义建设，对于巩固工农联盟的重大意义；从这些方面来说，所谓“不是什么大事”的看法当然是错误的。我们只要考虑到浪费或者节约粮食，关系着集体伙食的好坏，关系着入伙的广大职工、学生的生活，那末，过问集体伙食消费粮食的状况，就完全不是什么“事务主义”，而是一个负责的工作人员应有的态度。今后国家的粮食工作日益加强，供应各单位的粮食数量将逐步固定，在这种情况下，如果集体伙食单位继续浪费粮食，就会对入伙人员的生活发生极大的影响。因此，一个领导干部关心所属单位的集体伙食，监督主管集体伙食的工作人员好好地执行国家的粮食政策，这是关心群众生活的表现，是他应该完成的职责。为了使节约粮食逐步成为群众的自觉行动，每个单位的行政领导干部都应该反复深入地对全体工作人员进行宣传教育，讲明遵守国家粮食政策、节约粮食的重要意义，使他们深切地认识：这样做可以进一步密切党和政府同人民的关系，有利于工农联盟的巩固和社会主义建设的进行。
    集体伙食单位的管理人员，担负着组织所有炊事人员节约粮食的直接责任。他们工作得好坏，直接关系着节约或浪费粮食，直接关系着集体伙食的好坏。有些管理集体伙食的工作人员，不知道自己工作责任的重大，不好好研究和执行国家的粮食政策，只是沿用旧的管理伙食的方法，从自己工作的方便和本伙食单位的方便着想，来购买和使用粮食，这种做法是错误的。各单位行政负责干部要经常教育伙食管理人员节约粮食，把执行国家粮食政策、节约粮食列为考核他们工作成绩的重要项目之一。
    为了办好集体伙食，并为国家节约粮食，还必须依靠参加伙食单位的全体人员，通过一定的方式，对集体伙食进行监督。许多职工、学生认为自己同集体伙食的关系只是消费和供应的关系，只要不发生影响个人消费的事情，自己对伙食管理中的一切问题都不过问。这种态度是不对的。有些集体伙食单位所以没有认真执行国家的粮食政策，正是失去群众监督的结果。每个集体伙食的参加者都该知道，积极监督集体伙食，执行国家粮食政策，不仅可以节省粮食的消耗，而且可以减低伙食的成本，改善参加集体伙食的人员的生活。因此，每个参加集体伙食的人，为了国家的整体利益，为了个人的切身利益，都应该监督集体伙食单位的管理人员办好伙食，节约粮食。陈云副总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言中号召全国人民在正常消费水平上每人每天节约半两粮食，参加集体伙食的人员应该首先响应这个号召，研究和制定自己的节约粮食的计划。
    许多集体伙食单位在经营上缺乏计划，做饭方法墨守陈规，不会合理地处理剩饭和保管伙食用粮，也浪费了不少的粮食。有些管理集体伙食的工作人员，认为做几百个人的饭是不可能有计划的，因此，浪费一些粮食是不可避免的。但实际情况却不是这样。哈尔滨、上海等城市有些上千人的集体伙食单位，经过彻底整顿，实行有计划的经营方法，就消灭了浪费粮食的现象。这些事实证明，集体伙食能不能实行计划经营，绝不在于伙食单位的大小，而在于管理人员的工作态度、工作方法和工作作风。经过许多集体伙食试验，改进做饭方法，减少粮食损耗，增加出饭率，可以节约很多粮食。沈阳铁路分局二十几个食堂，改用压火焖饭的方法，一年节约大米、高粱米九万多斤；南京第八中学集体伙食实行了“生米蒸饭法”，每天节约一百多斤米。尽管这些改进的好处很多，但在实行过程中，还会遇到若干思想抵抗。例如，有些人借口“没有锅巴的饭不好吃”，反对改用科学的做饭方法。有些炊事人员顾虑没有经验，担心做不好饭，对改变做饭方法也有疑虑。必须通过具体事实，克服这些思想障碍，推行各种科学的做饭方法。各集体伙食单位要特别重视炊事人员在改进做饭方法、节约粮食方面的合理化建议，积极帮助他们克服在改进做饭方法过程中遇到的困难。
    集体伙食单位浪费粮食的漏洞是很多的。为了堵塞这些漏洞，必须抓紧每一个可能浪费粮食的环节。大的漏洞应该堵塞，小的漏洞同样不能放过。以清扫空的面粉袋为例。一条空面袋中扫出的面粉确实有限，把许多空面袋中的面粉收集起来就为数很多。国营天津第四棉纺织厂的炊事人员彻底扫刷空面袋，三个月节约面粉一百多斤，这就不是一个很小的数目。有些集体伙食单位浪费粮食的漏洞，有些已被揭发出来，但是，由于某些人的阻挠，一时还不能堵塞。例如，有些医院明明知道本单位浪费粮食的现象很严重，但不考虑如何改进，拒绝改正浪费粮食的错误。这样的单位必须受到严厉的批评，限期改变这种状况。
    节约粮食是一件长期的事情。所有节约粮食已有成绩的集体伙食单位，应该注意巩固节约工作的成果，防止“一阵风”过去又一切照旧的现象。巩固节约工作成果的办法是把各种切实可行的节约办法订成制度，包括对炊事人员节约或浪费粮食的奖惩制度。
    有些城市的领导节约粮食工作的部门，只顾向一般居民进行工作，放松了对集体伙食单位的领导，这种作法是不对的。参加集体伙食的人员虽是城市居民的先进部分，但是，在他们还没有彻底认识节约粮食的重大意义以前，他们对节约粮食工作还会有各种不正确的看法。有些人甚至认为这是一种“小事情”，马马虎虎，满不在乎，采取消极的态度。必须告诉这些人，要立即端正认识，国家工作人员、职工、学生应该在城市节约粮食的运动中起带头和模范作用。
