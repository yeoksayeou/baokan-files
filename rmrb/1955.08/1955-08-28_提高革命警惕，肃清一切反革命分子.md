Raise Revolutionary Vigilance, Eliminate All Counter-Revolutionaries
　　Severely Punish Criminals Who Continue to Do Evil After Being Treated With Leniency

To the Editor:

　　The Liujiang County People's Court of Guangxi Province sentenced counter-revolutionary element Liu Biao, who continued to engage in sabotage activities after being treated leniently by the government, to thirteen years of imprisonment on July 31.

　　Liu Biao was from Longtuan Village, Jinde Township, Liujiang County. Before liberation, he served in the Kuomintang reactionary government and trafficked in firearms. After liberation, he actively participated in and organized bandits, serving as a squad leader and battalion commander in bandit armed forces. This bandit gang was annihilated by our forces in December 1950. Liu was sentenced to imprisonment and labor reform, and was released home in 1953.

　　After being released, Liu Biao pretended to be "active" and "honest," and joined a mutual aid team, where he served as a newspaper reader. After joining the team, he eagerly took on all kinds of work, continuing to deceive the masses and gain their trust. Therefore, when the mutual aid team was transformed into an agricultural production cooperative in November 1954, he was absorbed into the cooperative.

　　After joining the cooperative, Liu Biao, on the one hand, pretended to be even more "active," and on the other hand, he conspired to seize the leadership of the cooperative. During the election of the cooperative's accountant, he shouted at the meeting of cooperative members, "The life of the entire cooperative depends on the accountant. We must elect someone with high education, who knows how to calculate, and knows how to manage the household" (he had the highest level of education in the entire cooperative, and was able to speak and calculate), attempting to get the cooperative members to elect him. However, the masses were not fooled, and his conspiracy failed. Therefore, Liu Biao changed his strategy, wooing backward cooperative members and attacking the responsible personnel of the cooperative, creating disputes within the cooperative. He repeatedly slandered the responsible personnel of the cooperative, saying that they were not leading well, managing well, and were engaging in corruption, and arrogantly proposed that the promotion and admission to the Party of the cooperative's staff must be approved by him. Liu Biao also used various means to sabotage the cooperative's production. For example, he once deliberately delayed the time for planting early rice, causing a reduction of more than 500 jin in the yield of five mu of early rice. In addition, he also dampened the enthusiasm of cooperative members for production and poured cold water on cooperative members who were actively engaged in production.

　　Due to Liu Biao's sabotage, the cooperative's work was chaotic, internal unity was lacking, and some cooperative members even demanded to withdraw from the cooperative, seriously hindering the consolidation of the cooperative and the improvement of production.

　　However, no matter how cunning and insidious the counter-revolutionaries may be, once the eyes of the masses are opened, they can see his hideous face clearly. After being reported by the masses, this counter-revolutionary element fell into the people's net again.

　　Expose the Crimes of Counter-Revolutionary Elements in Sabotaging the Policy of Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain

To the Editor:

　　Sabotaging the unified purchase and sale of grain is one of the ways in which class enemies in rural areas carry out sabotage activities. Recently, Tunliu County, Shanxi Province, exposed two incidents of counter-revolutionary elements Yang Dexi and Meng Tiecheng sabotaging the unified purchase and sale of grain.

　　Yang Dexi is from Dongpo Township, Tunliu County. He is a rich peasant and has always adopted a hostile attitude towards the Party and the government. From 1953 to 1955, he resisted paying agricultural tax for three consecutive years. After the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, in addition to falsely claiming to be a grain-deficient household to demand grain supply, he also continuously spread rumors and incited backward peasants to oppose the unified purchase and sale policy. This summer, he resolutely resisted selling surplus grain to the state and scolded the government for trying to starve him to death. Even more vicious and insidious, he deliberately ate elm leaves and coarse bran in front of the masses, attempting to incite the masses' dissatisfaction with the government's unified purchase policy. Later, it was proved that he had hidden more than 2,000 jin of wheat and autumn grain at home.

　　Meng Tiecheng is from Ducun Township, Tunliu County. He is a local tyrant and landlord and is the leader of a reactionary secret society. After the land reform, he continued to exploit peasants by lending money at usurious rates. After the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, he also rushed to buy grain, engaged in speculation and profiteering, and disrupted the market; in 1954 alone, he rushed to buy a total of five shi, eight dou, and six sheng of wheat and millet. In addition, he also spread rumors everywhere to sabotage the unified purchase and sale of grain. When he falsely claimed to be a grain-deficient household to demand grain supply in April of this year and was not approved, he scolded the government in the masses for being unreasonable and wanting to starve him to death. However, it was later discovered that he had a total of thirty-five shi, four dou, and seven sheng of various grains stored at home.

　　These two counter-revolutionary elements also fiercely attacked agricultural production cooperatives. For example, Yang Dexi told the peasants who joined the cooperative that they would be less free after joining the cooperative and would only suffer and not receive grain. Meng Tiecheng also used the same means to incite seventeen households of cooperative members to withdraw from the cooperative.

　　After being exposed by the masses, reactionary rich peasant Yang Dexi has been sentenced to one and a half years of imprisonment by the county people's court; Meng Tiecheng has also been arrested and is being interrogated. These two incidents have profoundly educated the broad masses of peasants and have greatly guaranteed the smooth progress of grain purchase and supply work.

　　Sanction Reactionary Rich Peasants Who Sabotage Agricultural Cooperatives

To the Editor:

　　On July 24, the Qianxi County People's Court of Hebei Province held a public trial and sentenced reactionary rich peasant Zhang Xiuting, who sabotaged agricultural production cooperatives, to fifteen years of imprisonment, which was warmly supported by the broad masses.

　　Zhang Xiuting is a reactionary rich peasant from Taipingzhai Township, Qianxi County. In 1953, he sneaked into the Yan Yunpeng Agricultural Production Cooperative and usurped the position of accountant. In order to carry out sabotage activities, he pretended to be active and invested some of his broken wooden boards in the cooperative at a reduced price. In addition, he used despicable means such as lending money to Yan Yunpeng, the director of the cooperative, and giving Yan Yunpeng extra work points to gain Yan Yunpeng's trust.

　　In the spring of 1954, this agricultural production cooperative bought ten buckets of foreign bees with the assistance of the government. In August of the same year, the number of bees had grown to twenty-nine buckets (worth more than 1,500 yuan), becoming one of the main assets of the cooperative; at the same time, the cooperative also earned more than 500 yuan from selling honey, which strongly supported agricultural production. Zhang Xiuting conspired to kill all the bees. He first boasted at the cooperative members' meeting that he knew the scientific methods of beekeeping, and tricked the cooperative members into entrusting him with the task of beekeeping. In winter, he did not store the bees according to the method of overwintering, but placed the bees in a humid place outside. Some cooperative members raised objections, but he ignored them. In early November, he secretly blocked the hive doors with cardboard, preventing the circulation of air in the bee chamber, and took out all the honey in the beehive. The twenty-nine buckets of bees were left in this way for three months, and all the bees died one after another due to freezing, starvation, and suffocation, causing huge losses to the agricultural production cooperative.

　　Zhang Xiuting's counter-revolutionary activities have been consistent. During the land reform in 1948, his seven surplus houses had been distributed to three poor peasant households, but Zhang Xiuting used many illegal means to get these houses back by reversing the accounting. Because the people around him were numb and inattentive at the time, and their vigilance was not high, his past criminal activities were not properly dealt with.

　　This trial by the People's Court has made everyone deeply aware of the insidious and vicious face of the enemy and has been greatly educated. At the meeting, seventy-three directors of agricultural production cooperatives expressed that they would definitely strengthen class education for cooperative members when they returned, purify the internal organization of the cooperative, ensure the completion of this year's production increase plan, and consolidate the socialist position in rural areas.

### 提高革命警惕，肃清一切反革命分子

专栏：

　　提高革命警惕，肃清一切反革命分子 　 严惩受到宽大处理后继续作恶的罪犯编辑同志：
    广西柳江县人民法院在七月三十一日判处了受到政府宽大处理后仍然进行破坏活动的反革命分子刘彪十三年徒刑。
    刘彪是柳江县进德乡龙团屯人，解放前除在国民党反动政府任职外，还贩买枪枝。解放后他积极参加并组织股匪，先后任土匪武装的分队长和营长。这一股土匪在一九五○年十二月被我歼灭，刘匪经判处徒刑，劳动改造，在一九五三年被释放回家。
    刘彪被释放后，就伪装“积极”“老实”，混入了互助组，并在组内担任了读报员。入组后，他样样工作争着干，继续骗取群众的信任，因而在一九五四年十一月互助组转为农业生产合作社的时候被吸收入社。
    刘彪入社以后，一方面伪装得更“积极”，一方面就阴谋夺取社的领导权。在社里选举会计的时候，他在社员大会上大嚷“全社性命在会计，要选文化高、懂得算、会当家的人”（他的文化是全社最高的，并且能讲会算），企图让社员们选他；但是群众并没有上他的当，他的阴谋没有实现。于是刘彪又改变策略，拉拢落后社员，打击社里的负责人员，制造社内纠纷。他不止一次地污蔑社的负责人员领导不好、管理不好、有贪污行为，并且狂妄地提出社里的工作人员立功、入党都要通过他才行。刘彪还用各种手段破坏社里的生产。例如有一次他故意推迟种早稻的时间，使五亩早稻减产五百多斤。此外，他还打击社员的生产情绪，对积极生产的社员泼冷水。
    由于刘彪的破坏，使社里工作混乱，内部不团结，部分社员并且闹退社，严重地妨碍了社的巩固和生产的提高。
    但是，尽管反革命分子怎样狡猾、阴险，群众的眼睛擦亮了之后，就能看清他的狰狞面目。经过群众的检举，这个反革命分子又落进人民的法网。

　  揭发反革命分子破坏粮食统购统销政策的罪行编辑同志：
    破坏粮食统购统销工作，是农村的阶级敌人进行破坏活动的方式之一。最近，山西省屯留县就揭发了反革命分子杨德喜和孟铁成破坏粮食统购统销工作的两个事件。
    杨德喜是屯留县东坡乡人，富农成份，一贯对党和政府采取敌对态度。一九五三年到一九五五年，他连续三年抗拒不交公粮。在实行粮食统购统销以后，他除了自己冒充缺粮户要求供应粮食以外，并不断造谣，煽动落后农民反对统购统销政策。今年夏季，他又坚决抗拒把余粮卖给国家，并且谩骂政府要把他饿死。更毒辣阴险的是，他故意在群众面前吃榆叶，吃粗糠，企图煽起群众对政府的统购政策不满。后来经检查证明，他家隐藏的麦子和秋粮有二千多斤。
    孟铁成是屯留县杜村乡人，他是一个恶霸地主，并且是反动会道门的道首。土地改革后他仍然放高利贷剥削农民。实行粮食统购统销以后，他又抢购粮食，投机倒把，扰乱市场；仅一九五四年他就抢购小麦、小米共五石八斗六升。另外，他还到处造谣，破坏粮食统购统销工作；当今年四月他冒充缺粮户要求供应粮食而没有被批准后，又在群众中大骂政府不讲理，要让他活活饿死。但是后来发现，他家里共存有各种粮食共三十五石四斗七升。
    这两个反革命分子还曾猖獗地向农业生产合作社进攻。如杨德喜就曾向入社的农民说是入了社多不自由，只能受苦而分不到粮食。孟铁成也曾用同样的手段煽动了十七户社员退社。
    经过群众揭发，反动富农杨德喜已被县人民法院判处徒刑一年半；孟铁成也已被逮捕，正在审讯中。这两个事件深刻地教育了广大农民群众，并对做好粮食收购和供应工作起了很大的保障作用。

　  制裁破坏农业合作社的反动富农编辑同志：
    七月二十四日，河北省迁西县人民法院召开公审大会，判处破坏农业生产合作社的反动富农张秀廷徒刑十五年，受到广大群众的热烈拥护。
    张秀廷是迁西县太平寨乡的反动富农，一九五三年混进了阎云朋农业生产合作社，并窃取了会计的职位。他为了进行破坏活动，就伪装积极，把自己的一些破木板等折价向社里投资。另外，他又用借钱给社主任阎云朋和给阎云朋多记工分等卑鄙手段，来骗取阎云朋的信任。
    一九五四年春，这个农业生产合作社在政府扶助下买了十桶洋蜂。同年八月，蜜蜂已发展到二十九桶（价值一千五百多元），成为社里主要财富之一；同时社里还收入了卖蜜钱五百多元，有力地支持了农业生产。张秀廷就阴谋将全部蜜蜂害死。他先在社员大会上吹嘘自己懂得养蜂的科学方法，骗取社员们委托他负责养蜂的工作。到了冬天，他不按蜜蜂越冬的办法保管，却将蜜蜂放在外边潮湿的地方。有的社员提出意见，他也毫不理睬。十一月初，他又偷偷地用纸板将蜂的窠门堵上，使蜂室的空气不能流通，并把蜂箱里的蜜全部取出来。二十九桶蜜蜂被这样放了三个月，由于又冻、又饿、又闷，全部蜜蜂先后死掉，造成农业生产合作社的巨大损失。
    张秀廷的反革命活动是一贯的。一九四八年土地改革时，他的多余房屋七间已被分配给三户贫农居住，但是张秀廷采用很多非法手段，把这些房屋都倒算了回来。由于当时周围的人麻痹大意，警惕性不高，所以他过去的罪恶活动都没有得到应有的处理。
    这次人民法院的审判使大家深刻地认识了敌人阴险毒辣的面貌，受到了很大的教育。在会上有七十三个农业生产合作社主任表示回去一定对社员加强阶级教育，纯洁社内组织，保证完成今年的增产计划，巩固农村社会主义阵地。
