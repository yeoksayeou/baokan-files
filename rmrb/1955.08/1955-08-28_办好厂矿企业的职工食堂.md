　　Running Factory and Mining Enterprise Employee Cafeterias Well
According to letters from readers in various locations, the cafeterias in some factories and mining enterprises are currently being run very poorly, causing dissatisfaction among the majority of employees.

Some cafeterias are poorly managed, with food that is both expensive and unpalatable. For example, the prices at the No. 1 Cafeteria of the Jilin Railway Employees are higher than those at private restaurants; a small dish costs only four cents but sells for six cents. Furthermore, this cafeteria uses the state-supplied soybean oil for special stir-fries that only a few people can eat regularly, while the ordinary dishes eaten by most employees have little or no oil. Another example is the employee cafeteria of the Beijing Automobile Transportation Company, where the food is often poorly made. The steamed sponge cake is either not risen properly or is too sour to eat, and the corn bread is sometimes bitter. Workers buy it but cannot eat it and have to return it.

Some cafeterias have overly complicated procedures for selling food, which employees find very inconvenient. For example, the cafeteria of the Sixth Engineering Office of the First Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction, in order to save trouble for itself, has implemented a "special counter for special sales" system. As a result, employees buying steamed buns, vegetables, and soup have to queue three times, each time for ten to twenty minutes, and by the time they have bought everything, the food is cold. The situation is similar at the State-owned Shijiazhuang No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory cafeteria, where employees first have to buy a bowl token, then buy rice, and then buy vegetables. Because of the back-and-forth queuing, not only is the mealtime prolonged, but the cafeteria is also extremely crowded and chaotic.

Poor hygiene is a serious problem in many cafeterias. The walls of the cafeteria of the Second Construction Company of the Anshan Dagushan Mine are covered with slogans such as "Don't eat things that flies have crawled on," but the dining hall is swarming with a layer of black flies, and the cooks say that "there are too many flies to swat." Diners often find flies and insects in their vegetables or steamed buns. The congee barrels in the Kouquan Railway Employee Cafeteria have a thick layer of accumulated grime because they have not been washed for a long time, and the chopping boards are often used as washing tools by the cooks. The walls and floors of the dining room are crawling with insects. To save trouble, the cafeteria steams a batch of buns and sells them for several days, sometimes even selling moldy buns to everyone. There are many such examples. As one reader's letter stated: In such cafeterias, people can only eat with their eyes closed.

There are, of course, many reasons why employee cafeterias are not run well, but the main reason is that the relevant leaders of these factories and mining enterprises believe that managing the cafeteria is an insignificant matter, and therefore abandon leadership and inspection of the cafeteria work, even ignoring the opinions of the employees after they raise concerns about the cafeteria. For example, the employees of the Sixth Engineering Office of the Northeast No. 1 Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction have repeatedly reported the shortcomings of the cafeteria to the director's office, but the director's office simply ignores them. The cafeteria at the construction site of the Tianjin No. 1 Construction Engineering Company's Workers and Peasants Rapid Completion Middle School is very poorly run, and the workers have many complaints, but the site director ignores them, saying, "Where would I find the time to deal with these things?"

This attitude towards cafeteria work is completely wrong and is a concrete manifestation of the enterprise leaders and trade union workers' lack of concern for the masses' lives. Chairman Mao once instructed us: "While implementing the policy of increasing production and practicing economy, we must pay attention to the safety, health, and necessary welfare of the workers and staff; it would be wrong to pay attention only to the former aspect and forget or slightly neglect the latter." Facts have also proven that some factory and mining cafeterias are run very poorly, and employees cannot eat well, which affects their enthusiasm for labor. More seriously, the unsanitary conditions of some cafeterias have already affected the health of the employees and reduced attendance rates. For example, the hygiene of the State-owned Qingdao No. 8 Cotton Textile Factory cafeteria has always been very poor. On July 4th, the pork liver served contained many fly eggs, and on the 4th and 5th, forty-four employees suffered from acute gastroenteritis, and twenty-nine were unable to work due to illness.

Running employee cafeterias well also plays a significant role in conserving food. Currently, some cafeterias have loopholes in food conservation because they are not run well. For example, the "Reader's Letter Page" on August 7th exposed the fact that the cafeteria in the Babaoshan Mining Area of Huailai County had half a jin of steamed bun per bun, and five liang of rice per bowl of rice, and the cafeteria in the Shacheng Brick Factory had at least one jin per portion of rice, so there was a lot of leftover rice and steamed buns at every meal in these two cafeterias. Another example is the employee cafeteria of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Primary Rolling Mill, where employees refused to eat the food after finding dirty things in it. Therefore, in order to do a good job in food conservation, the leadership of factories and mining enterprises should also actively value improving the work of employee cafeterias.

In the recent urban food conservation campaign, many units have studied and improved the work of their cafeterias. For example, in addition to coming up with many ways to conserve food, the Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant cafeteria has also increased the variety of flour-based foods to more than a dozen, such as blooming steamed buns and layered pancakes, and made the dishes neither too salty nor too bland, so that the workers can eat according to their tastes and not leave any leftovers. The No. 5725 construction site cafeteria of the Beijing No. 7 Construction Engineering Company has improved its food according to the principles of "economical, clean, delicious, and nutritious," which not only conserved food but also ensured the health of the workers and increased attendance rates to a certain extent. There are many such examples in various places. All units whose employee cafeterias are not well-run should correct the erroneous thinking of not valuing the work of the cafeterias, educate the cafeteria management and culinary staff to learn from the experiences of other units, actively improve their work, so that employees can eat well and exert greater enthusiasm for labor in their work, and strive to complete the state production plan.

### 办好厂矿企业的职工食堂

　　办好厂矿企业的职工食堂
    根据各地读者来信反映，目前有一部分厂矿企业的食堂办得很坏，引起了广大职工的不满。
    有些食堂经营管理不善，饭菜既贵又不好吃。例如，吉林铁路职工第一食堂菜的价格比私人饭馆还贵，像一个小菜成本只有四分，卖价却要六分；另外，这个食堂还把国家供应的豆油都用在只有少数人能经常吃的特等炒菜上，大多数职工吃的普通菜里就一点油也没有。又如，北京市汽车运输公司职工食堂吃的东西经常做不好，蒸的丝糕不是没发起来，就是酸得不能入嘴，窝头有时也是苦的；工人们买了不能吃，只能退回去。
    还有一些食堂卖饭手续过于复杂，使职工感到极不方便。如建筑工程部第一工程公司第六工程处的食堂为了自己省事，实行了“专口专卖”的办法；于是，吃饭的职工买馒头、买菜、买汤要排三次队，每次一、二十分钟，等买全后饭菜都凉了。国营石家庄第二棉纺织厂食堂的情况也是这样，职工吃饭时先要买碗牌，再去买饭，然后又去买菜；因为来回排队，不但吃饭时间拖得很长，而且食堂也挤得混乱不堪。
    卫生工作做得不好，这在不少食堂是一个严重的问题。鞍山大孤山矿第二建设公司食堂的墙上贴着“不要吃苍蝇爬过的东西”等很多标语，但是饭厅里到处聚着一层黑鸦鸦的苍蝇，炊事员却说是
  “苍蝇太多没法打”；吃饭的人还常在菜里或馒头里发现苍蝇和虫子。口泉铁路职工食堂里稀饭桶因为长期不洗而已经有了很厚一层积垢，切菜板经常被炊事人员当洗衣工具，餐厅的墙上、地上爬着很多虫子；食堂里为了图省事，蒸一次馒头就卖好几天，有时馒头发了霉还卖给大伙吃。这样的例子还有不少。正如读者来信中所说的：在这种食堂里，人们只有闭着眼睛才能吃得下饭。
    职工食堂办得不好的原因当然有很多；但是其中主要的原因就是这些厂矿企业的有关领导人员认为，管理食堂是一件无足轻重的小事，因而放弃了对食堂工作的领导和检查，甚至在职工群众对食堂工作提出意见以后仍然置之不理。例如，建筑工程部东北第一工程公司第六工程处的职工曾多次向主任办公室反映食堂工作的缺点，但是主任办公室根本不加理会。天津市第一建筑工程公司工农速成中学工地的食堂办得很糟，工人意见很多，但是工地主任置之不理，反而说：“那有时间搞这些事呢？”
    对待食堂工作的这种态度是十分错误的，是企业领导人员和工会工作者不关心群众生活的具体表现。毛主席曾指示过我们：“在实施增产节约的同时，必须注意职工的安全健康和必不可少的福利事业；如果只注意前一方面，忘记或稍加忽视后一方面，都是错误的。”事实也证明了，有些厂矿食堂办得很糟，职工吃不好饭，影响了劳动热情。更严重的是，有些食堂的不卫生已经影响了职工健康，影响了出勤率。像国营青岛第八棉纺织厂食堂卫生一直搞得很糟，七月四日供应的猪肝里有很多苍蝇卵，四日、五日两天中职工得了急性肠胃炎的有四十四人，因病不能工作的有二十九人。
    办好职工食堂，还对节约粮食的工作有着重大的作用。目前，有些食堂因为没有办好，就出现了一些浪费粮食的漏洞。例如，八月七日的“读者来信专页”曾揭发过这样的事实：怀来县八宝山矿区食堂每个馒头有半斤重，每碗饭有五两米，沙城砖厂食堂每份饭起码是一斤，因而这两个食堂每餐都有很多剩下的饭和馒头。又如，鞍钢初轧厂职工食堂因为食物里有脏东西，职工发现后就不吃了。因此，为了做好节约粮食的工作，厂矿企业的领导方面也应该积极重视改进职工食堂的工作。
    在最近城市节约粮食工作中，有不少单位研究并改进了食堂工作。如齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂食堂除了想出很多节约粮食的办法外，还把面食增加了开花馒头，千层饼等十几种花样，把菜做得不咸不淡，让工人吃着合口味，不剩饭。北京市第七建筑工程公司五七二五工地食堂根据“节约、干净、好吃、有营养”的原则改善伙食，不但节约了粮食，而且在一定程度上保证了工人的健康，提高了出勤率。这样的例子各地都很多。所有职工食堂没有办好的单位都应该纠正不重视食堂工作的错误思想，教育食堂管理人员和炊事工作人员学习其他单位的经验，积极改进工作，使职工能够吃好饭，在工作中发挥更大的劳动热情，为完成国家生产计划而努力。
