Recently, we spent a week in the hometown of the counter-revolutionary Lu Dian to gain a preliminary understanding of his reactionary history. During the investigation, we had relatively extensive contact and conversations with local staff and the masses. They exposed Lu Dian's background, experiences, and his counter-revolutionary activities in his hometown, further revealing Lu Dian's sinister counter-revolutionary face.

At the beginning of the Second Revolutionary Civil War, Guixi County, Jiangxi Province, was one of the revolutionary base areas of the Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi revolutionary base. The area near Tangwan District of Guixi County was a guerrilla zone and border area of the revolutionary base. At that time, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army led by comrades Fang Zhimin, Shao Shiping, and others persisted in revolutionary struggle in Lingxi, just over ten miles away from Tangwan, establishing Soviet areas and guerrilla zones. Subsequently, guerrilla activities flourished in the surrounding areas, and the counter-revolutionary forces more viciously counterattacked the revolution. In this situation and environment, Lu Dian deeply resented the Communist Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army led by the Party, thus embarking on the criminal path of counter-revolution.

Lu Dian, originally named Liu Guibei (Pei), with the school name Liu Zhensheng (Xing), was from Liujia Village, Lu Dian Township, Tangwan District, Guixi County, Jiangxi Province. In 1926, when he was twelve years old, he was introduced by his uncle Liu Qingshan (a big, evil landlord, already suppressed) to work as an apprentice at the Tongshunhe grocery store in Xinan (then a guerrilla zone, now Shangzhu Township). After three years of apprenticeship, he continued to work as a clerk in the Tongshunhe and Fanglongmao stores there for four years. At that time, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army guerrilla team frequently operated in this area, constantly striking at the Kuomintang bandit army and reactionary forces. The Kuomintang bandit army also frequently concentrated its forces, attempting to extinguish our guerrilla forces. However, our guerrilla team operated very cleverly, causing the Kuomintang bandit army to suffer repeated attacks. The Kuomintang bandit army, in a fit of rage, vented its anger on the ordinary people, burning down many houses in Xinan Street in an attempt to eradicate the foundation of our guerrilla activities. Lu Dian not only did not consider the burning of the shops to be the crime of the Kuomintang reactionaries, but also extremely hated the Communist Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. After returning home from Xinan to the White Area, he wantonly slandered our Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, saying: "If it weren't for the 'bandits' (referring to the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, same below), the shop wouldn't have been burned, wouldn't I be doing very well there! These lowly 'bandits' made me lose my job and I don't even have a place to stay."

When Lu Dian was nineteen years old, he entered the Guixi County Second District Pseudo-Salt Public Sales Office as a lackey. At that time, blockading the supply of materials to the Soviet area was one of the most vicious means by which the Kuomintang reactionaries strangled the revolution and the people. This pseudo-salt public sales office was a monopoly agency for salt blockade. They stipulated that each person could buy five qian of salt per day, to be bought and eaten daily, with very strict control. Lu Dian went out early and returned late, tirelessly serving the reactionaries. He was good at flattering and gradually became close to the upper-level figures of the local reactionaries. However, Lu Dian and his master's insidious methods did not succeed. The people of the Soviet area saved their own salt to support the guerrillas who persisted in the mountains, completely foiling the counter-revolutionary plot.

From then on, Lu Dian's counter-revolutionary and anti-people criminal activities became increasingly rampant. In the winter of 1933, he still relied on his usual skills of boasting and flattery to climb into the Guixi County Pseudo-Cadre Training Institute run by the Kuomintang. At this time, he was already the prized student of Zhou Feizhongxun, the pseudo-deputy commander of the Jiangxi Provincial Security and the pseudo-magistrate of Guixi County. After receiving training for six months, he returned to his hometown and actively organized and trained the "Anti-Communist Volunteer Corps." Lu Dian often boasted about Zhou Feizhongxun, saying: "Zhou Zhongxun is a very 'sha jia' (meaning fierce and vicious) person, brave in 'suppressing bandits' and has made great 'contributions'." He also said: "The 'bandits' (referring to the Red Army and guerrillas in the Soviet area) in the northern township have been dealt with very badly..." The following year, due to Lu Dian's "meritorious service" in anti-communist training, he was promoted to drillmaster of the "Anti-Communist Volunteer Corps." In 1935, he was again promoted to the director of the first joint-guarantee office of the second district of the pseudo-Guixi County and the head of the twelfth bao due to his "outstanding achievements."

Lu Dian worked very hard in anti-communist and anti-people political work. When training the "Anti-Communist Volunteer Corps," he repeatedly peddled Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary and shameless rhetoric of "internal pacification before external resistance," and vigorously promoted "anti-communism." He described the Communist Party's struggle to overthrow the three major enemies as "pretending to be communist to deceive peasants and workers," and he vilified the revolutionary cause led by the Chinese Communist Party as "harming the country, ruining the people, and harming ancestors." He also arrogantly stated: "Where there are 'bandits,' there is no me; where there is me, there are no 'bandits.'" From this, we can see that Lu Dian's hatred for the Party and the revolution was already so deep.

Lu Dian not only actively carried out "anti-communist" propaganda, but also adopted means of wanton beating, scolding, humiliation, deception and fraud against the masses who received "training" in order to "offer credit" to the reactionaries and express "loyalty." During the training of the "Anti-Communist Volunteer Corps," he used vicious methods such as beating with horse whips, fining "Five Grains God" (i.e., standing at attention with both hands outstretched), running, kneeling, standing, issuing guarantees, and fining materials for members who were late, absent due to errands, or did not abide by "team rules." Sometimes he even directly threatened the masses with "detention and legal action."

The following fact occurred in Wudun Village, Lu Dian Township, where Lu Dian personally trained the "Anti-Communist Volunteer Corps": One morning in the seventh lunar month of 1934, the "Anti-Communist Volunteer Corps" was arranging its formation as usual under Lu Dian's command. When counting off during roll call, Deng Fuxi, a 45-year-old farmer, made a mistake three times in a row because he was older. Lu Dian dragged Deng Fuxi out and whipped him with a bamboo stick, threatening to send him to the pseudo-district office for "detention and legal action." At that time, he only let go after everyone explained and persuaded him. In the end, the farmer Deng Fuxi was still "punished" to stand in the sun for an hour, and Lu Dian also demanded Deng Fuxi to issue a guarantee and defraud him of dozens of catties of cakes as "apology gifts." In addition, poor peasants Deng Zhenxing and Chen Qingbao were also beaten, scolded, and "fined" by Lu Dian for "being late for no reason" or "poor operation."

Under the heroic blows of our guerrilla team, the Kuomintang bandit army stationed in Tangwan Town, repaired the bunkers built by landlords near Tangwan Town, and dug moats and built wooden walls around the town to monitor and resist the attacks of our guerrilla team. At this time, Lu Dian, in the capacity of the pseudo-joint-guarantee director, tried his best to actively cooperate with the Kuomintang bandit army stationed in the town in the activities of digging moats and building wooden walls, flattering the bandit army officers, forcefully assigning labor, and obeying orders. Once, when felling timber for building the wooden wall, because the assigned masses were too tired and did not work "well," it angered the Kuomintang bandit army, so it quickly issued an "emergency instruction": Each worker must go up the mountain to cut down one hundred trees that night. Lu Dian actively implemented the bandit army's "instructions," forcing the masses to go up the mountain to cut trees in the dark until late at night. Liu Jianpu, the former farmer and current director of the first agricultural production cooperative, recalled the situation of being forced to dig moats and build wooden walls at that time. He told us that at that time, not doing it "satisfactorily" meant whips, "Five Grains God," and kneeling. Lu Dian also went to the scene with the Kuomintang bandit army officers to "supervise the work."

In the seventh lunar month of 1934, in order to demonstrate to the people of the Soviet area and the guerrilla team and encourage the "morale" of the bandit army and the "Anti-Communist Volunteer Corps," the reactionaries held a district-wide review meeting of nearly 2,000 people in the square of Lijia Village, Datang Township. Lu Dian led the "Anti-Communist Volunteer Corps" to participate in this meeting, and Zhou Feizhongxun gave a counter-revolutionary speech at the meeting. During the review, Lu Dian wore a Kuomintang military uniform, was majestic, and arrogant. After the review, a young revolutionary comrade of ours was also killed at the meeting. In the ninth lunar month of the same year, Lu Dian led the "Anti-Communist Volunteer Corps" to cooperate with the Kuomintang bandit army in "encircling and suppressing" the revolutionary base area, continuously harassing our Lingxi area. In a "clearing the countryside and encircling" operation, Lu Dian colluded with the Kuomintang bandit army and adopted vicious means to force the masses to walk in front of the team and invade Lingxi. At that time, our guerrilla team had already learned of this news and promptly organized the people of the Soviet area to go up the mountain temporarily. After the bandit army and the "Anti-Communist Volunteer Corps" invaded the guerrilla area and searched everywhere, they found nothing and went into a beastly rage, wantonly looting the property of the people in the Soviet area.

Lu Dian left his hometown in 1935. He joined the military camp of the pseudo-Nanjing Central Training Corps hosted by bandit leader Gui Yongqing for training. During this period, Lu Dian relied on his superiors and hometown connections and quickly gained Gui Fei Yongqing's "attention." He made a series of counter-revolutionary activities.

After liberation, Lu Dian restored contact with his hometown. In order to dilute the impression of his past criminal history, he adopted double-dealing deceptive means. In his letters to his hometown, he boasted of himself as a "revolutionary," saying that he was a "revolutionary soldier," to win the trust of the local masses and the government, to achieve the purpose of treating his family (mother) as "military dependents," and the masses cultivated the fields for him for four years. In 1953, after the Second National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, Lu Dian, carrying out Hu Feng's "order," quickly contacted members of the Hu Feng clique in Shanghai, Hangzhou and other places, and when he was plotting to attack the Party, he returned to his hometown. He acted like an official in front of the masses, pretending to be a "Communist Party writer." He said more than once that after leaving his hometown for many years, he had been doing "revolutionary" work. He said that he had been engaged in underground propaganda work in the Kuomintang army, and had also been a instructor, district head, and county head in the liberated area. He falsely claimed that he was in the Kuomintang army: "A Kuomintang during the day and a Communist Party at night." "Eat the Kuomintang's rice and do the Communist Party's work." This is completely a thorough lie, just as Liu Xunlang, the chairman of the township farmers' association, said: "In fact, Lu Dian eats the Communist Party's rice and does the Kuomintang's work."

On May 20, 1955, just seven days after the "People's Daily" exposed the first batch of materials of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, Lu Dian suddenly wrote a letter to the First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Liujia Village, Lu Dian Township, Tangwan District, Guixi County, saying: "I heard that the cooperative is working and piling up some farm implements in my house. I am very happy. My house has really found a good patron and arranged a proper use..." Obviously, the counter-revolutionary Lu Dian was using double-dealing deceptive means, the purpose of which was: to deceive and confuse the masses, in an attempt not to expose his true counter-revolutionary face, so as to lurk in the Party and the revolutionary ranks for a long time and carry out more vicious counter-revolutionary sabotage conspiracies. But his conspiracy did not succeed.

The crimes of Hu Feng clique member Lu Dian have been exposed. Deng Fuxi, a farmer who had been beaten, scolded and extorted by Lu Dian, is now 64 years old. After recalling the situation 19 years ago, he said: "Liu Zhensheng (i.e., Lu Dian) was not aware of how bad and hateful he was when he was a trainer, drillmaster, and joint-guarantee director. Counter-revolutionaries will eventually have such an end." These words express the people's resentment towards counter-revolutionaries!

    反革命分子芦甸的一段罪恶历史
    赵显　王坚
    最近，我们以一个星期的时间，在反革命分子芦甸的家乡，就芦甸反动的历史进行了初步了解。在调查了解过程中，我们同当地工作人员和群众进行了比较广泛的接触和交谈。他们揭穿了芦甸的出身、经历以及他在家乡的反革命活动等事实，芦甸的反革命的狰狞面目更进一步暴露出来了。
    在第二次国内革命战争开始时期，江西省贵溪县是闽浙赣革命根据地之一。贵溪县塘湾区附近即为革命根据地的游击区和边沿地区。当时方志敏、邵式平等同志领导下的工农红军，在距塘湾只十多里地的岭西一带坚持革命斗争，建立了苏区和游击区。此后，附近地区蓬勃地展开了游击活动，反革命势力对革命也愈加恶毒地进行反扑，在这种情况和环境下，芦甸深深地怀恨着共产党和党所领导的工农红军，因而走上了反革命的罪恶道路。
    芦甸，原名刘贵焙（佩），学名刘振声（兴），江西省贵溪县塘湾区芦甸乡刘家村人。一九二六年，在他十二岁的时候，曾由他伯父刘庆山（大恶霸地主，已镇压）介绍到溪南（当时的游击区，即现在的上祝乡）同顺和杂货店当学徒，三年满师以后，继续在该地同顺和、方隆茂两店当店员四年。当时，工农红军游击队经常在这一带活动，不断予国民党匪军和反动势力以打击，而国民党匪军也经常集中兵力，企图扑灭我游击队伍。而我们的游击队活动得很巧妙，使国民党匪军屡遭袭击，国民党匪军老羞成怒，在普通人民身上泄忿，一把火烧毁了溪南街许多房屋，阴谋根绝我游击队的活动基础。芦甸对店铺的被烧毁，不仅不认为是国民党反动派的罪恶，反而极度仇恨共产党和工农红军。他由溪南回家到白区以后，便大肆污蔑我工农红军，说：“要不是‘土匪’（指工农红军，下同），店不烧，我在那里不是很好吗！这下等‘土匪’弄得我失业，连落脚的地方都没有。”
    芦甸十九岁时，进入了贵溪县第二区伪食盐公卖处当一名走卒。当时封锁苏区物资供应是国民党反动派对革命对人民实行最毒辣的扼杀手段之一，这个伪食盐公卖处就是进行食盐封锁的一个专卖机构。他们规定每人每天五钱盐，日买日吃，控制非常严格。芦甸日出夜归，不辞辛苦为反动派效忠。他善于吹拍，逐渐同当地反动派的上层人物接近。但是，芦甸和他的主子的这种阴险手段并未得逞。苏区人民节省自己口盐，支援了坚持在山里的游击队，使反革命的这种阴谋完全破产。
    从此，芦甸反革命反人民的罪恶活动便愈来愈猖獗了。一九三三年冬，他仍旧凭着善于吹牛拍马的惯技，爬进了国民党举办的贵溪县伪干部人员养成所。他在这时已是伪江西省保安副司令、贵溪县伪县长周匪忠恂的得意门生。他受训六个月以后，回乡积极组织和训练“铲共义勇队”。芦甸经常为周匪忠恂吹嘘：“周忠恂是个顶‘杀夹’（即凶恶、毒辣的意思）的人，‘剿匪’勇敢，‘功劳’很大。”又说：“北乡‘土匪’（指苏区红军和游击队）给办得很苦……。”第二年，由于芦甸反共训练有“功”，被提升为“铲共义勇队”督练员。一九三五年，又由于“功绩卓越”，被提升为伪贵溪县第二区第一联保办事处联保主任兼第十二保保长。
    芦甸作反共、反人民的政治工作是非常卖力的。在训练“铲共义勇队”时，他无数次地贩卖蒋贼“安内攘外”的反动无耻谰言，极力鼓吹“反共”论调。他把共产党领导全国人民推翻三大敌人的斗争说成是“假借共产骗农工”，他把中国共产党领导的革命事业污蔑为“祸国败民害祖宗”。他还气焰嚣张地表示：“有‘匪’无我，有我无‘匪’。”从这里可以看到，芦甸对党对革命的仇恨早就如此之深。
    芦甸不仅积极进行“反共”宣传，并对受“训”群众采取了肆意打骂、欺辱诈骗的手段，向反动派“献功”和表示“忠实”。在训练“铲共义勇队”的期间，他对迟到、因事不来或不守“队规”的队员，施用马鞭毒打、罚“五谷神”（即两手伸平立正）、跑步、罚跪、罚站、具结以及罚以物资等恶毒手段，有时还直接以“拘押法办”来威胁群众。
    下面的事实发生在芦甸亲自训练“铲共义勇队”的芦甸乡乌墩村：在一九三四年农历七月的一个早晨，“铲共义勇队”照例在芦甸指挥下整理队形，在点名报数的时候，四十五岁的农民邓阜西由于年纪大些，曾经接连报错了三次。芦甸便把邓阜西拖出来，扬起竹棍抽打，并且扬言要送伪区公所“拘留法办”。当时，经过大家解释劝说才放了手。最后农民邓阜西还是在太阳底下被“罚”站了一小时，芦甸还要邓阜西具结，诈取几十斤饼作为“陪礼”。此外，贫农邓振兴、陈庆保等也因“无故迟到”或“操法不好”挨过芦甸的打骂和罚作过“五谷神”。
    国民党匪军在我游击队英勇的打击下，驻守在塘湾镇，他们修理在塘湾镇附近地主所建造的碉堡，又在环镇周围挖壕沟筑木城，以监视和抵制我游击队的袭击活动。这时，芦甸以伪联保主任的身份，在挖壕沟筑木城的活动中，竭力同驻镇国民党匪军主动配合，讨好匪军军官，强硬派工，唯命是从。有一次，在砍伐筑木城所用木材时，由于派工群众过分疲乏，工作得“不好”，激怒了国民党匪军，于是很快地发出一个“紧急指示”：每个民工在当天晚上一定要上山砍伐一百根树木。芦甸积极执行匪军“指令”，强迫群众摸黑上山砍树直到深夜。曾经被迫派过工的农民、现第一农业生产合作社社长刘建谱，回忆起当时被迫挖壕沟筑木城的情况，他告诉我们说：那时候，做得不“顺心”就是皮鞭子、“五谷神”、罚跪。芦甸还曾同国民党匪军军官到现场“监工”。
    一九三四年农历七月间，反动派为了对苏区人民和游击队示威，鼓励匪军和“铲共义勇队”的“士气”，在大塘乡李家村广场举行了一个全区性近二千多人的检阅大会。芦甸率领“铲共义勇队”参加了这次大会，周匪忠恂在这个会上作了反革命的训话。检阅时，芦甸穿着国民党军装，威风凛凛，趾高气扬。检阅后，大会上还杀害了我们一个年轻的革命同志。同年农历九月间，芦甸带领“铲共义勇队”配合国民党匪军“围剿”革命根据地，连续骚扰我岭西一带，在一次“清乡围剿”中，芦甸同国民党匪军勾结，采取恶毒的手段，强迫群众走在队伍前面，向岭西进犯。当时我游击队早已得知这一消息，就及时组织苏区人民暂时上山。当匪军和“铲共义勇队”侵入游击区后，到处搜查扑空，便兽性发作，大肆抢劫苏区人民的财物。
    芦甸一九三五年开始离开家乡。他投入了匪魁桂永清主持的伪南京中央教导总队军事营受训。在这期间，芦甸依靠上司和同乡关系，很快地取得桂匪永清的“重视”。作了一系列的反革命活动。
    解放后，芦甸在恢复了他同家乡的联系，为了冲淡人们对他过去罪恶历史的印象，便采取了两面派的欺骗手段。他给乡里来信时以“革命者”自夸，他说自己是“革命军人”，骗取当地群众和政府的信任，达到以“军属”优待他的家属（母亲）的目的，群众替他代耕田地整四年之久。一九五三年，在全国第二次文代会后，芦甸执行胡风的“命令”迅速联络上海、杭州等胡风集团分子、策划向党进攻的阴谋活动时，他回到了家乡。他在群众面前打官腔，装作是“共产党员作家”了。他不止一次地说，多年来他离开家乡后，一直在作“革命”工作，他说自己在国民党军队里搞地下宣传工作，在解放区又做过指导员、区长、县长。伪称在国民党部队里是：“日间是国民党，夜间是共产党。”“吃国民党的饭，做共产党的事。”这完全是彻头彻尾的谎言，正如该乡农会主席刘勋朗所说：“实际上芦甸是吃共产党的饭，做国民党的事。”
    一九五五年五月二十日，就在“人民日报”揭发胡风反革命集团第一批材料的七天以后，芦甸忽然给贵溪县塘湾区芦甸乡刘家村第一农业生产合作社写了一封信，信上说：“听说合作社在我房子里办公和堆些农具，我非常高兴，我的房子这才算真正找到了好主顾，安排了一个恰当的用场……。”很明显，反革命分子芦甸是在使用两面派的欺骗手段，其目的在于：欺瞒迷惑群众，企图不致揭穿他的反革命真面目，从而长期潜伏在党和革命队伍内部，进行更恶毒的反革命破坏阴谋。但他的阴谋并未得逞。
    胡风集团分子芦甸的罪行被揭发出来了，曾经挨过芦甸打骂敲诈的农民邓阜西，现在已六十四岁了，他回想起十九年以前的情况后说：“刘振声（即芦甸）当训练员、督练员、联保主任的时候，不晓得有几坏几可恶，反革命分子终有这样的下场。”这句话道出了人们对反革命分子的愤恨！
