French Communist Party Deputies Condemn Government Suppression of the Algerian People

The French National Assembly held a debate from July 28th to 29th regarding the extension of the validity period of the "state of emergency" law in Algeria.

The validity period of this law ends on October 3rd. Since this date falls during the parliamentary recess, the government requested authorization to extend the validity period of the law for six months by issuing a decree.

During the debate, Interior Minister Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury spoke, insisting that "order" must be restored in Algeria.

Jacques Duclos, Chairman of the French Communist Party parliamentary group, emphasized in his speech that the adoption of the so-called "state of emergency" law in Algeria violated the French Constitution. Duclos said that the government intends to use force to solve the Algerian problem, but force cannot subdue the people who hope to be liberated from oppression and poverty.

Duclos said that negotiations must be conducted with representatives of the Algerian people in order to establish a new relationship between France and Algeria, a relationship that should be based on the recognition of the national aspirations of the Algerian people and be in the interests of the French people. Duclos pointed out that to achieve this, it is first necessary to stop any colonial oppression and military actions in Algeria, lift martial law, release prisoners, and recall the troops and police sent to Algeria in recent months.

Socialist Deputy Ben Bella also advocated stopping the colonial suppression of the Algerian people. He said that it is not permissible to continue carrying out encirclements, burnings, destruction, and violent oppression.

Pierre Cot, a deputy of the Progressive Republican Union, emphasized that the current situation in Algeria may develop into a "new type of Indochina war." He believes that Algeria and France should establish relations on a new basis.

French Communist Party Deputy Fajon suggested at the afternoon meeting on the 29th that the "state of emergency" law in Algeria be repealed, but this suggestion was rejected.

The National Assembly finally passed a resolution by a majority to extend the validity period of the "state of emergency" law for six months.

Demonstrations Against French Colonialists Continue to Occur in Morocco

On the evening of July 30th, Moroccans held a grand demonstration in the city of Marrakesh in southern Morocco to celebrate Eid al-Adha. Demonstrators demanded the reinstatement of Sultan Sidi Mohammed ben Youssef, who was exiled by the French authorities. A fire broke out in Marrakesh during the demonstration. Police opened fire on the demonstrators, killing ten people, wounding seven, and arresting sixty.

On the 30th, movements against French colonialists also occurred in the Moroccan cities of Moulay Idriss and Casablanca.

Not long ago, when the new French Resident General in Morocco, Gilbert Grandval, arrived in Marrakesh and Meknes during his "investigative tour" of Morocco, local residents held demonstrations demanding the reinstatement of Youssef. French police opened fire on the demonstrating masses, resulting in dozens of Moroccan deaths and injuries in the two cities.

Karachi Rally Protests French Oppression of North African Muslim Residents

Karachi held a rally of more than 5,000 people on July 29th, condemning French oppression of Muslim residents in Morocco and Algeria.

The conference was convened by twenty Muslim cultural and religious groups, and presided over by Abdul Rahman Abdus Salem, the Saudi Arabian ambassador to Pakistan.

The conference passed a resolution requesting Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Ali to protest to the French government against the use of NATO troops by France in Morocco and Algeria. Another resolution passed by the conference requested the Secretary-General of the United Nations to raise the issue of Morocco and Algeria in the United Nations.

Bombay Dockworkers Decide to Boycott Cargo Ships Entering and Leaving Goa

On July 28th, 5,000 Bombay dockworkers held a rally under the auspices of the Bombay Dock Transport Workers Union. At the meeting, it was decided to boycott all foreign ships carrying cargo in and out of Goa in order to ensure the cessation of all maritime trade in Goa.

Singapore Legislative Assembly Asks Britain to Grant Singapore Self-Government

According to Western news agencies, the Singapore Legislative Assembly passed a resolution on July 25th by a vote of twenty-eight to one, demanding that the British government immediately grant Singapore self-government and formulate a new Singapore constitution. The resolution firmly demanded an end to British colonial rule. British official legislators abstained from voting.

When Singapore Chief Minister Marshall proposed this motion in the Legislative Assembly on July 22nd, he pointed out that the current Singapore constitution delayed Singapore's development towards self-government. Marshall opposed the Governor of Singapore's ability to arbitrarily reject the opinions of the Chief Minister and the Council of Ministers. Previously, Marshall had told the Singapore press that the current Singapore constitution shows that the British government wants Malayan politicians to play the role of well-trained puppets during British colonial rule.

Lee Kuan Yew, a legislator of the Singapore People's Action Party, supported Marshall's proposal. He also demanded the immediate realization of complete independence in Singapore.

The Speaker of the Singapore Legislative Assembly has informed the Governor of Singapore of the resolution passed this time. (Xinhua News Agency)

    坚决反对殖民主义，争取民族独立和自由
    法共议员谴责政府镇压阿尔及利亚人民
    法国国民议会从七月二十八日到二十九日举行了关于延长阿尔及利亚“紧急状态”法的有效期限问题的辩论。
    这个法律的有效期限到十月三日为止，由于这
  一日期正在议会休假期中，因此政府要求授权以颁布法令的方式把这个法律的有效期限延长六个月。
    在辩论过程中，内政部长布歇—莫努里发言坚持主张必须恢复阿尔及利亚的“秩序”。
    法国共产党议会党团主席杜克洛在发言中着重指出，在阿尔及利亚采用所谓“紧急状态”法是违反法国宪法的。杜克洛说，政府打算用武力来解决阿尔及利亚问题，但是，武力并不能使希望从压迫和贫困下求得解放的人民屈服。
    杜克洛说，必须同阿尔及利亚人民的代表进行谈判，以便建立法国和阿尔及利亚之间的新的关系，这种关系应该建立在承认阿尔及利亚人民民族愿望的基础上，并且是符合法国人民的利益的。杜克洛指出，要做到这一点，必须首先停止在阿尔及利亚实行任何殖民压迫和军事行动，解除戒严，释放囚犯和从阿尔及利亚召回最近几个月派去的军队和警察。
    社会党议员奔巴麦德也主张停止对阿尔及利亚人民的殖民镇压。他说，不能允许继续进行围剿、焚烧、破坏和暴力压迫。
    进步共和联盟议员皮埃尔·戈特着重指出，阿尔及利亚目前情况可能发展成为“新型的印度支那战争”。他认为阿尔及利亚和法国应该在新的基础上建立关系。
    法国共产党议员法耶在二十九日下午会议上建议取消阿尔及利亚“紧急状态”法，这个建议被否决。
    国民议会最后以多数通过把“紧急状态”法的有效期限延长六个月。

    七月三十日晚间，摩洛哥人在摩洛哥南部马拉喀什城举行盛大示威，庆祝古尔邦节。示威者要求被法国当局放逐的苏丹西迪·穆罕默德·本·优素福复位。在示威的时候，马拉喀什城失火。警察向示威者开火，击毙十人，击伤七人，逮捕六十人。
    三十日，摩洛哥的穆拉伊—伊德里斯和卡萨布兰卡两市也都发生反对法国殖民者的运动。
    不久以前，当法国驻摩洛哥新总督格朗瓦在摩洛哥各地进行“调查旅行”到达马拉喀什和麦克尼斯时，当地居民都举行了示威，要求让优素福复位。法国警察向示威群众开火，结果两个城市中死伤了好几十个摩洛哥人。
    喀喇蚩集会抗议法国压迫北非回教居民

    大会通过决议，要求巴基斯坦总理穆罕默德·阿里向法国政府提出抗议，抗议法国在摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚使用北大西洋集团的军队。大会通过的另一个决议要求联合国秘书长在联合国提出摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚问题。

    新加坡立法议会要求英国让新加坡自治
    据西方通讯社报道，新加坡立法议会七月二十五日以二十八票对一票通过了一项要求英国政府立即让新加坡实行自治并且制定新的新加坡宪法的决议。决议坚决要求结束英国的殖民统治。英国官方的立法议员在投票时弃权。
    新加坡首席部长马歇尔七月二十二日在立法议会提出这个提案时指出，现行的新加坡宪法拖延了新加坡朝着自治方向的发展。马歇尔反对新加坡总督可以随意拒绝首席部长和部长会议的意见。在这以前，马歇尔曾向新加坡报界发表谈话说，现行的新加坡宪法表明，英国政府要马来亚的政界人士在英国殖民主义统治期间作为训练有素的傀儡来扮演“民主”的角色。
    新加坡人民行动党立法议员李光耀支持马歇尔的提案。他还要求立即在新加坡实现完全的独立。
    新加坡立法议会议长已经将这次通过的决议转告新加坡总督。　（据新华社讯）
