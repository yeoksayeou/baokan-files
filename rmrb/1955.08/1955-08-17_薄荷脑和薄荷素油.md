    Menthol and Peppermint Oil
    He Ke
    The quality of menthol produced in China ranks first in the world, with an annual output accounting for 40% of the world's total. It has been selling well in European and American countries, as well as countries like India, for many years. The peppermint oil produced in China is also a world-renowned commodity, extremely popular among people in tropical countries.
    Menthol is a needle-shaped crystal, and peppermint oil is a colorless or slightly yellow liquid. Both are extracted from the leaves and stems of mint. They have a wide range of uses. In pharmaceuticals, they can be used as antibacterial, disinfectant, and antiseptic products, as well as cooling agents, local anesthetics, flavoring agents, and in products like cooling balm, Bagua Dan, and cough syrup. In food, they can be used to make candy, pastries, cigarettes, and liquor. In daily necessities, they can be used in cosmetics, toothpaste, and tooth powder.
    Exporting one pound of menthol can be exchanged for 94 kilograms of steel. The peppermint oil exported in 1950 could be exchanged for enough rails to lay over 300 kilometers of railway.
    With the development of China's foreign trade, the export volume of menthol and peppermint oil is increasing daily. However, the oil yield of mint produced in many areas is still very low. Agricultural authorities in mint-producing areas should strengthen technical guidance to farmers who grow mint, so that they can use improved varieties and improve cultivation methods. At the same time, purchasing departments should also guide farmers in refining crude oil to ensure the quality of the crude peppermint oil.

    薄荷脑和薄荷素油
    何可
    我国出产的薄荷脑品质居世界第一位，年产量占世界总产量的百分之四十，历年来一直畅销于欧洲美洲各国和印度等国家。我国出产的薄荷素油也是驰名世界的商品，极为热带国家的人民所喜用。
    薄荷脑是一种针状的结晶体，薄荷素油是无色或微黄色的液体，两者都是由薄荷的叶和茎提炼成的。它们的用途极广。在制药方面可做杀菌、消毒、防腐用品和清凉剂、局部麻醉药、矫味剂以及清凉油、八卦丹、止咳糖等，在食品方面可制糖果、糕点、烟、酒等，在日用品方面可做化妆品和牙膏、牙粉。
    输出薄荷脑一磅可以换回九十四公斤钢材。一九五○年出口的薄荷素油，约可换回铺三百多公里铁路的铁轨。
    随着我国对外贸易的发展，薄荷脑和薄荷油的出口量日益增加。但目前不少地区所产的薄荷出油率还很低，薄荷产区的农业机关应对种植薄荷的农民加强技术指导，使他们采用良种，改进培植方法。同时，收购部门对农民提炼原油也应该加以指导，以保证薄荷原油的质量。
