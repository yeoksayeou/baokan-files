    The Ministry of Supervision of the People's Republic of China issued instructions on August 11, requesting all local supervisory organs to strengthen grain supervision work in the second half of the year. The instructions stated that, under the unified leadership of the Party and the government, local supervisory organs, in coordination with the grain authorities, had conducted general and focused inspections of grain storage, processing, allocation, and supply in major provinces and cities across the country, uncovering many serious problems. Some of these problems have been dealt with promptly, while others are still being processed. However, problems in grain work cannot be eliminated after only one or a few inspections. On the contrary, some problems have not been thoroughly investigated; some problems have not been fundamentally resolved; and some, after being investigated, have recurred because the responsible departments were negligent and did not go to the field to supervise and inspect thoroughly. In addition, lax work systems, unclear responsibilities, and the failure to remove bad elements mixed in with the storage personnel have resulted in relatively common, and in some cases even serious, situations of grain suffering from insect pests, mildew, rat consumption, losses, waste, fire, and theft. Therefore, local supervisory organs must strengthen inspections of grain work in coordination with the grain authorities.

    The instructions require that the following main aspects must be focused on in the grain supervision work in the second half of the year:

    1.  We must use the greatest effort to inspect the implementation of the policy of unified grain purchase and inspect the preparations for autumn grain storage. Personnel from the provincial and prefectural-level supervisory organs (including dispatched teams in key counties) participating in this inspection must first be familiar with the unified purchase policy and methods. We must understand whether the policy of fixed production is correctly implemented by inspecting the implementation of the unified purchase policy. We must carefully study and analyze the causes of various problems, and propose appropriate and feasible opinions to the leading organs; for certain errors and shortcomings in the work style and methods of the staff, we should adopt methods of criticism and education to make them deeply reflect and correct themselves; lawless and undisciplined elements must be dealt with seriously; and those counter-revolutionaries engaged in sabotage activities must be recommended to the public security and judicial organs for punishment according to law. Before the new grain is put into storage, local supervisory organs must check whether the grain authorities have effectively made preparations. At the same time, they must urge them to do a good job in grain storage.

    2. After the autumn grain is put into storage, a considerable amount of effort should be immediately focused on key inspections of grain storage work to promote planned self-inspection by the grain authorities. In the hot and humid autumn, new grain is most prone to high temperatures, insect infestation, and mildew after being put into storage. It is necessary to urge the grain authorities to take effective measures to accurately grasp the grain conditions, implement the policy of prevention being more important than cure, timely turn and dry the grain, reduce grain temperature and moisture content, pay attention to warehouse hygiene, and promptly deal with insect erosion and mildew; at the same time, strengthen warehouse safety protection, strictly prevent fires, counter-revolutionary arson, and theft by bad people.

    3.  After October, a portion of the effort should be focused on key inspections of grain allocation, transportation, and processing. In terms of allocation and transportation, it is required to improve unreasonable allocation plans, overcome blind and unplanned phenomena of facing each other, detours, and reverse transportation, reduce the waste of transportation capacity, and eliminate transportation accidents. It is also necessary to check and correct the tendency of processing departments to simply pursue output without paying attention to ensuring the rate of finished products and quality, and to overcome waste in processing.

    4.  The supervisory organs of municipalities directly under the central government and municipalities under provincial jurisdiction must effectively inspect the implementation of grain supply policies and supply plans.

    The instructions concluded: The inspection of the above-mentioned tasks must be carried out in a planned and prepared manner. At the end of the inspection, the experience and lessons learned must be comprehensively and deeply summarized, and suggestions must be made to the responsible departments to help them improve their work.

    监察部指示各监察机关加强粮食监察工作
    中华人民共和国监察部在八月十一日发出指示，要求各地监察机关在下半年内加强粮食监察工作。指示中说，各地监察机关在党和政府的统一领导下，曾经协同粮食主管部门对全国主要省、市粮食保管、加工、调拨和供应情况作了普遍检查和重点检查，揭发了许多严重问题。这些问题有的及时作了处理，有的还在继续处理。但粮食工作中的问题，绝不是经过一次或几次检查就能消除的，相反地，有些问题并未查透；有些问题并未得到根本解决；有的在查过之后又因为主管部门疏忽大意，不深入现场督促检查，加之工作制度不严，责任不明，混入保管人员中的坏分子没有清除出去，致使粮食遭受虫害、霉烂、鼠耗、损失、浪费、失火、盗窃等情形还相当普遍，有的甚至是严重的。因此，各地监察机关必须协同粮食主管部门加强对粮食工作的检查。
    指示要求下半年粮食监察工作必须抓紧以下几个主要方面：
    一、要以最大力量对粮食统购政策的执行情形进行检查，并对秋粮入库的准备工作进行检查。各省和专区级监察机关（包括重点县派遣小组）参加这一检查工作的人员，必须首先熟悉统购政策和办法。要通过检查统购政策的执行情况了解定产政策是否正确贯彻。认真地研究分析发生各种问题的原因，对领导机关提出适当可行的意见；对工作人员工作作风和工作方法上的某些错误和缺点，应采取批评教育的方式使其深刻检讨改正；对违法乱纪分子必须严肃处理；对那些进行破坏活动的反革命分子，必须建议公安、司法机关依法惩办。　　各地监察机关在新粮入库之前，必须检查粮食主管部门是否切实进行了准备工作。同时督促他们作好粮食入仓工作。
    二、秋粮入库后，应即以相当大的力量对粮食保管工作进行重点检查，推动粮食主管部门有计划地普遍自查。在闷热多雨的秋天，新粮入库后最易发生高温、生虫和霉烂，必须督促粮食主管部门采取有效措施，准确地掌握粮情，贯彻防重于治的方针，适时翻晒，降低粮温和水分，注意仓房卫生，并及时处理虫蚀和霉变；同时应加强仓房安全保护，严防失火及反革命纵火和坏人的偷窃。
    三、十月以后应以一部分力量对粮食调拨、运输、加工情形进行重点检查。在调运方面，要求改进不合理的调拨计划，克服盲目无计划的相向、迂回和倒运现象，减少运输力的浪费，消除运输事故。并须检查纠正加工部门单纯追求产量，而不注意保证出品率和质量的偏向，克服加工中的浪费现象。
    四、直辖市和省辖市监察机关，必须切实检查粮食供应政策和供应计划的执行情况。
    指示最后说：上述各项工作的检查，必须有计划有准备地进行，检查结束时，必须全面深入地总结经验教训，向主管部门提出建议，帮助他们改进工作。（新华社）
