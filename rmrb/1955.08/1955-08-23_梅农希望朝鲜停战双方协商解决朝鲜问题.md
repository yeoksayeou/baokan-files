　　Menon Hopes Korean War Armistice Parties Will Settle the Korean Issue Through Negotiation

    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 22nd: The Chief Representative of India to the United Nations, V.K. Krishna Menon, recently stated that the political issues of Korea should be resolved through negotiations by the parties involved in the Korean War.

    Answering questions at a reception held by the Delhi Malayali Association in his honor on the evening of the 21st, Menon said, "Peace in Korea is very important because it affects the whole world, at least the Asian world." He also said that the cessation of the Korean War was in itself a good thing, and people now hope that the situation will at least not deteriorate.

    Menon said that a conference was held in Geneva last year to discuss the Korean issue, but it did not achieve any results. China and North Korea could not agree to the United Nations presiding over elections there because the United Nations was a party to the dispute.

    Menon said that ultimately everything will depend on negotiations between the two sides, and he requested that "political issues should be decided by representatives of both sides meeting."

    Menon said that he believes that as a result of the Geneva Four-Power Summit, "there is already a better atmosphere in world affairs."

　　梅农希望朝鲜停战双方协商解决朝鲜问题
    新华社新德里二十二日电　印度驻联合国首席代表维·克·克里希纳·梅农最近表示，应当由朝鲜战争有关双方来谈判解决朝鲜政治问题。
    梅农二十一日晚间在德里马拉雅里人协会欢迎他的招待会上回答问题时说：“朝鲜的和平是很重要的，因为它影响全世界，至少影响亚洲世界。”他还说，朝鲜战争的停止本身是一件好事情，人们现在希望局势至少不恶化。
    梅农说，去年在日内瓦举行了讨论朝鲜问题的会议，但是没有获得任何结果。中国和北朝鲜不能同意联合国在那里主持选举，因为联合国是争执一方。
    梅农说，最后一切将决定于双方谈判，他要求“政治问题应当由双方派代表开会来决定”。
    梅农说，他认为日内瓦四国首脑会议举行的结果，“在世界事务中，已经有了较良好的气氛”。
