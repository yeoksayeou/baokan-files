Bring into Play the Enthusiasm of Overseas Chinese in Participating in the Construction of the Motherland
　　Chen Qiyuan
    Overseas Chinese love their motherland and hometowns, and the motherland's care and concern for Overseas Chinese is even more meticulous. In the nearly six years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the state has formulated various laws and carried out a series of work regarding Overseas Chinese remittances, dual nationalities of Overseas Chinese, Overseas Chinese investment, land reform in Overseas Chinese hometowns, schooling for Overseas Chinese students, and production of Overseas Chinese dependents, based on needs and possibilities, to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese abroad, and the achievements are enormous. Recently, the "Regulations on Overseas Chinese Applying to Use State-Owned Barren Mountains and Wasteland," passed by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and promulgated by Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China, is another extremely important regulation by the state to take care of the interests of Overseas Chinese; the broad masses of Overseas Chinese and their families are excited and encouraged, expressing infinite gratitude to the motherland. It is certain that the formulation and promulgation of this regulation will effectively bring into play the patriotic enthusiasm of Overseas Chinese and their enthusiasm to participate in the construction of the motherland.
    There are more than 12 million Overseas Chinese, scattered in Southeast Asia and countries around the world. Most Overseas Chinese come from the rural areas of the motherland. After going abroad, they have reclaimed land and participated in the agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and industrial and commercial enterprises of their places of residence, playing a significant role in the economic prosperity of their places of residence. There are more than 10 million Overseas Chinese dependents in China, and Overseas Chinese have the idea of "a tree a thousand feet tall eventually returns to its roots." Therefore, Overseas Chinese love their motherland and hometowns, maintain close ties with the motherland, and are very concerned about their descendants. For a long time, Overseas Chinese have longed for the liberation of the motherland and actively participated in the successive revolutionary movements of the motherland. After liberation, the motherland became independent and strong, and various constructions progressed by leaps and bounds, which fulfilled the wishes of Overseas Chinese. Their patriotic spirit has been further developed, and they hope to contribute their share to the great economic construction of the motherland.
    Overseas Chinese deeply know that there are many ways to contribute to the country, and based on their own characteristics and conditions, applying to use state-owned barren mountains and wasteland to develop agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry is a practical and feasible way. This is an economic construction work that is beneficial to the country, beneficial to the people, and infinitely beneficial to the Overseas Chinese themselves and their descendants. The motherland has a vast territory, with many barren mountains and wastelands in urgent need of development. The subtropical climate of Overseas Chinese hometowns such as Fujian, Guangdong, and Yunnan provinces is roughly the same as that of Southeast Asia, so there are many crops, cash crops, trees, and livestock that can be raised. Overseas Chinese themselves are rich in experience and expertise in operating these undertakings, so proceeding with this work will be twice the result with half the effort.
    The "Regulations on Overseas Chinese Applying to Use State-Owned Barren Mountains and Wasteland" formulated by the state fully meet the specific circumstances of Overseas Chinese. The regulations stipulate that there are as many as four types of business operation methods: private investment, joint public-private operation, individual operation, and cooperative operation (Article 2). This allows Overseas Chinese with different circumstances to choose any one of these methods according to the amount of their funds, their abilities, and their personal wishes, without causing obstacles. The regulations set a very long "term of use," generally from 20 to 50 years (Article 4). This ensures that Overseas Chinese have sufficient time to engage in long-term operation on the land they use and fully obtain the legal benefits of the operating period, without incurring losses due to a short time period. The regulations also stipulate that: before perennial crops such as trees yield profits, or in the event of harvest failures due to disasters, they shall enjoy tax reductions and exemptions in accordance with regulations (Article 9); Overseas Chinese who use state-owned barren mountains and wasteland and adopt individual or cooperative operation methods shall not pay usage fees, the same as other farmers who use state-owned land (Article 3); and in the course of operation, the government authorities in charge shall also provide necessary technical guidance (Article 10). All of these are the state's care and consideration for Overseas Chinese, which reduces various difficulties for Overseas Chinese and is conducive to the establishment and development of enterprises.
    Article 4 of the regulations also specifically stipulates: "Within the term of use, the state guarantees the operator's land use rights and the income from legal operation." This is fully in line with the spirit of Articles 11 and 98 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. This eliminates the unnecessary concerns about future production and life for some Overseas Chinese who have been away from the country for too long and do not understand the motherland well enough, and helps Overseas Chinese invest in and participate in the construction of the motherland. Twenty to fifty years is a very long time, which is equivalent to the time when the motherland's economic construction has completed four or ten five-year plans, but the regulations adopt a policy of providing legal guarantees by the state for the operator's land use rights and the income from legal operation.
    The formulation and promulgation of this regulation is very appropriate and very timely. This is a regulation by the state to take care of Overseas Chinese and point out the normal path of production and life for the broad masses of Overseas Chinese and their families. This is a regulation that benefits Overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese cheer for the formulation and promulgation of this regulation and will use practical actions to do a good job in the development of barren mountains and wasteland to respond to the motherland's care.

　　发挥华侨参加祖国建设的积极性
　　陈其瑗
    华侨是爱祖国爱故乡的，而祖国对于华侨的爱护关怀，更是无微不至的。中华人民共和国成立近六年来，国家对华侨汇款、华侨双重国籍、华侨投资、华侨家乡土地改革、侨生就学、侨眷生产等问题，都按照需要和可能，制定了各种法律和进行了一系列的工作，来保障国外华侨的正当权利和利益，成就是巨大的。最近，由全国人民代表大会常务委员会通过，由中华人民共和国主席毛泽东予以公布的“华侨申请使用国有的荒山荒地条例”，又是国家照顾华侨利益的一个极其重要的条例；广大华侨和侨眷兴奋鼓舞，对祖国表示无限的感激。可以肯定，这一条例的制定和公布，将有效地发挥华侨的爱国主义热情和参加祖国建设的积极性。
    华侨有一千二百多万人，散处在东南亚和世界各国。华侨多出身于祖国的农村，出国以后，开荒辟土，参与了侨居地的农、林、畜牧事业和工商事业，对于侨居地经济的繁荣，起了不少作用。华侨在国内有一千多万侨眷，而华侨又有“树高千丈，落叶归根”的思想，因此，华侨热爱祖国、热爱家乡，同祖国的联系密切，对后代子孙也十分怀念。长期以来，华侨渴望祖国解放，并积极参加了祖国历次革命运动。解放后，祖国独立强盛，各种建设突飞猛进，符合了华侨的愿望，华侨的爱国主义精神有了更大的发扬，他们希望能在祖国伟大的经济建设事业中，献出自己的一分力量。
    华侨深深知道，为国家出力之道甚多，而根据本身的特点和条件来说，申请使用国有的荒山荒地来兴办农、林、畜牧事业，则是一条切实可行的出路，这是对祖国有益，对人民有利，对华侨本身及其后代好处无穷的一种经济建设工作。祖国地域广阔，荒山荒地不少，急需开发，而侨乡如福建、广东、云南等省的亚热带气候，又大致同东南亚一带相同，可以种植的农作物、经济作物、林木和可以经营的畜牧业很多，华侨本身恰恰富有经营这些事业的经验和特长，进行起来，会事半而功倍。
    国家所制定的“华侨申请使用国有的荒山荒地条例”充分适应了华侨的具体情况。条例规定，经营方式计有私资经营、公私合营、个体经营、合作社经营等四种之多（第二条），这就使得各种情况不同的华侨可以按照每人的资金多寡、能力大小和个人志愿，选择其中的任何一种方式来进行，不会发生窒碍。条例对“使用期限”定得很长，一般定为二十年至五十年（第四条），这就保证华侨能有充分时间在使用的土地上进行长期经营，充分获得经营期内的合法利益，不会发生因时间过短而引起的损失。条例还规定了：在林木等多年生作物未有收益以前或因灾歉收等情况下，照章享受减税、免税的待遇（第九条）；华侨使用国有荒山、荒地，采用个体经营方式或合作社经营方式的，同其他使用国有土地的农民一样，不缴纳使用费（第三条）；在经营过程中，政府主管机关还给以必要的技术指导（第十条）。所有这些，都是国家对华侨的关怀和照顾，这就使得华侨减少种种困难，有利于企业的开办和发展。
    条例第四条还特别规定：“在使用期限内，国家保障经营人的土地使用权和合法经营的收益。”这和中华人民共和国宪法第十一条及第九十八条的精神是完全符合的。这就使得某些离国过久、对祖国不够了解的华侨消除了对将来生产上和生活上的多余顾虑，有助于华侨投资参加祖国的建设事业。二十年到五十年是一个很长的时间，也就是说，等于祖国的经济建设已完成四个或十个五年计划的时间，但条例对于经营人的土地使用权和合法经营的收益，是采取由国家给以法律保障的政策。
    这一条例的制定和公布是十分妥当和十分适时的，这是国家照顾华侨，对广大华侨、侨眷指出生产和生活的正常大道的条例，这是为华侨造福的条例。华侨们为这一条例的制定和公布而欢呼，并将用实际行动，搞好荒山荒地的开发工作，来回答祖国的关怀。
