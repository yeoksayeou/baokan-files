Xinhua News Agency, 19th. According to a TASS report: The Yugoslav Federal People's Assembly delegation, headed by Bakarić, Speaker of the Parliament of the People's Republic of Croatia, Yugoslavia, returned to Moscow on the 18th after a ten-day tour of various parts of the Soviet Union. The delegation visited Leningrad, Kiev, Poltava, Kharkov, Stalingrad, Sochi, and Tbilisi.
    In Leningrad, the representatives visited historical sites such as Smolny and Lenin's former residence, and toured large factories. Bakarić said that Leningrad had never allowed any enemy to trample on its land. This is precisely its image in the minds of the Yugoslav people. When we have to make difficult decisions, we often draw inspiration from the experience of Leningrad.
    During their trip to Ukraine, the delegation visited many agricultural production institutions and were very interested in the storage of crops and corn there. The Yugoslav parliamentarians also showed great interest in learning about the work of the Supreme Soviet of this republic.
    The delegation members were deeply impressed by Stalingrad. When the Yugoslav guests spoke of their impressions of this legendary city, they said that during the Second World War, the heroism of the Soviet army inspired them in the anti-fascist struggle.
    When the delegation arrived on the Black Sea coast of the Caucasus, the weather was clear. After visiting the Sochi-Matsesta resort, the guests went on to visit the "Cheka" sanatorium of the shipbuilding industry and the Ordzhonikidze sanatorium of the coal mining industry.
    Wherever the Yugoslav guests went, they were warmly and sincerely welcomed by the Soviet working people, and cordial conversations took place everywhere. Because the members of the delegation spoke Russian well, no translators were needed in the conversations.

　　在苏联各地访问后
　  南议会代表团回到莫斯科
    新华社十九日讯　据塔斯社报道：以南斯拉夫克罗地亚人民共和国议会议长巴卡里奇为首的南斯拉夫联邦共和国国民议会代表团在苏联各地作了十天旅行之后，于十八日回到莫斯科。代表团访问了列宁格勒、基辅、波尔塔发、哈尔科夫、斯大林格勒、索契和第比利斯。
    在列宁格勒，代表们参观了斯莫尔尼和列宁故居等名胜古迹，参观了大的工厂。巴卡里奇说，列宁格勒从来没有让任何一个敌人践踏过它的土地。这正是它在南斯拉夫人民心目中的形象。当我们必须作出艰难的决定时，我们常常从列宁格勒的经验得到鼓舞。
    代表团在乌克兰旅行中参观了许多农业生产机构，对于这里的农作物和玉蜀黍的贮藏极感兴趣。南斯拉夫议员们还怀着很大兴趣了解了这个共和国最高苏维埃的工作。
    代表团人员对斯大林格勒有极深刻的印象。南斯拉夫客人们谈到他们对这座传奇式的城市的印象时说，在第二次世界大战期间，苏联军队的英雄气概在反法西斯的斗争中鼓舞着他们。
    代表团到达高加索的黑海沿岸时，天气晴朗。在参观了索契—马泽斯塔休养地以后，客人们即去参观造船工业的“契卡”疗养院和煤矿工业的奥尔忠尼启则疗养院。
    南斯拉夫客人们无论到那里都受到苏联劳动人民的热烈和真诚的欢迎，到处都进行亲切的交谈。因为代表团团员们的俄语很好，在交谈中不需要翻译员。
