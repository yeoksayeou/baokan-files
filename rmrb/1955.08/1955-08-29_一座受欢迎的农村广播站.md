    In Shiyang Township, Guanxian County, at the foot of Mount Qingcheng on the western Sichuan Plain, a network of overhead wires is as dense as the irrigation system on the ground, connecting hundreds of natural villages. A wired broadcasting station has been established here for a year and a half. From the broadcast, farmers can hear news of construction across the country every day, victory reports from the front lines in Fujian and Zhejiang, the tide of people around the world fighting to defend peace, as well as beautiful songs and dramas.
    The Shiyangchang Wired Broadcasting Station was established in August 1953 with the help of the Sichuan People's Broadcasting Station. By February 1954, the entire wired broadcasting network in the township was completed. Five hundred and fifty-six loudspeakers were spread across courtyards throughout the township. After a day of hard work, farmers can sit in the courtyard or in their own homes in the evening and happily enjoy their favorite radio programs.
    With the radio station, the farmers of Shiyang Township often looked forward to hearing Chairman Mao's voice from the loudspeakers. On September 15, 1954, their wish was fulfilled. On this day, the Central People's Broadcasting Station rebroadcast the live proceedings of the opening of the First Session of the First National People's Congress. When Chairman Mao's loud and powerful speech was broadcast from the loudspeakers, the joy of the people of Shiyang Township was indescribable. Gao Ding'an's 70-year-old mother from the Thirteenth Village could not sleep with excitement after hearing Chairman Mao's speech. She said gratefully, "Chairman Mao brought us these good days."
    In addition to regularly rebroadcasting news and agricultural programs from the Central People's Broadcasting Station and the Sichuan People's Broadcasting Station, the radio station also organizes programs that guide local work in light of local conditions. Before the autumn harvest in 1954, the newly established agricultural producers' cooperative in Shiyang Township held a "trial calculation" meeting in Shiyangchang. In order to promote the establishment of cooperatives throughout the township before the autumn harvest, the radio station rebroadcast the actual speeches made at the meeting. Many cooperative members used their own experiences to talk about the advantages of cooperatives, which educated many farmers. In July 1954, a national grain market was established in Shiyangchang. After the radio station publicized the benefits of establishing a grain market to the farmers and pointed out some unnecessary concerns of the masses, the amount of grain on the market increased greatly the next day.
      During the summer of 1954, the radio station also held special programs for graduates of higher primary and junior high schools who had not been able to continue their education, organizing speeches by typical individuals and introducing role models for graduates participating in production. These programs helped students realize that continuing education and engaging in productive labor were equally glorious. He Peiqin, a student from the Eleventh Village, listened to the broadcast and settled down to participate in agricultural production, saying, "Our radio station is a good teacher for learning." Students often use the radio to learn about current affairs and sing songs, and some even took notes.
    The literary and artistic programs frequently broadcast by the radio station have enriched the cultural life of the people throughout the township. Many farmers who had never seen a "big opera" can now often hear "Sichuan Opera" and "Beijing Opera." The singing lessons organized by the radio station are even more popular with listeners. Each time, more than 600 copies of the song lists are printed, and in some places, the songs are copied on blackboards for everyone to learn to sing.
    Now, listening to the radio has become a part of the daily life of the people of Shiyang Township.

　　一座受欢迎的农村广播站
　　王茹
    在川西平原青城山下的灌县石羊乡，架空的电线网像地面上的灌溉水系一样地密布着，它把几百个自然村庄联结在一起。这里建立起有线广播站已经一年半了。从广播站的播音里，农民每天能听到祖国各地的建设消息，福建、浙江前线的胜利捷报，全世界人民为保卫和平而斗争的浪潮，还能听到优美的歌曲、戏剧等。
    石羊场有线广播站是一九五三年八月，在四川人民广播电台的帮助下开始建立的，到一九五四年二月，全乡的有线广播网全部建成。五百五十六只喇叭遍布在全乡各个院坝。农民们辛勤劳动了一天，晚上坐在院坝或自己家里，便能愉快地欣赏着他们所心爱的广播节目。
    有了广播站，石羊乡的农民便经常盼望着能从喇叭里听到毛主席的声音。一九五四年九月十五日，他们的愿望实现了。这一天中央人民广播电台转播了第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议开幕的会场实况。当喇叭里播出毛主席宏亮、有力的讲话声时，石羊乡人民的高兴是无法形容的。十三村农民高定安的七十多岁的老母亲，听了毛主席的讲话后，兴奋得连觉也睡不着，她感激地说：“这好日子，就是毛主席给我们带来的。”
    广播站除经常转播中央人民广播电台、四川人民广播电台的新闻节目、农业节目，还结合当地情况举办指导当地工作的节目。一九五四年秋收前，石羊乡的新生农业生产合作社在石羊场举行“试算”大会，广播站为了推动全乡秋收前的建社工作，转播了大会发言的实况。许多社员用自己的亲身经历讲述了合作社的优越性，使很多农民受到了教育。一九五四年七月间石羊场建立国家粮食市场，当广播站向农民宣传了建立粮食市场的好处并指出了群众的一些不必要的顾虑以后，第二天上市的粮食便大大增加。
      一九五四年暑期，广播站还为未能升学的高小、初中毕业学生举办了专门节目，组织典型人物讲话，介绍毕业生参加生产的模范人物，这些节目帮助学生们认识了升学和劳动生产是同样光荣的。十一村学生何培琴听了广播，安下心来参加农业生产，并且说：“我们的广播站，就是学习的好老师”。学生们经常利用广播学时事、学唱歌，有的还记了笔记。
    广播站经常播送的文艺节目，丰富了全乡人民的文化生活。很多没有看过“大戏”的农民，现在都可以经常听到“川戏”、“京戏”。广播站组织的教唱歌节目，更受到听众的欢迎，每次印发的歌单在六百份以上，有的地方还用黑板把歌曲抄下来，供大家学唱。
    现在，听广播已经成了石羊乡人民日常生活中的一部分。
