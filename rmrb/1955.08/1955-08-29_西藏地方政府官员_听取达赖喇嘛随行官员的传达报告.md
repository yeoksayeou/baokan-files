　　Tibetan Local Government Officials
　　Listen to Reports from Officials Accompanying the Dalai Lama
　　All officials of the Tibetan local government in Lhasa, along with the Khenpos of the three major monasteries of Ganden, Sera, and Drepung, retired officials, and officers of the Tibetan local government army at the rank of Rubon (equivalent to battalion commander) and above, totaling more than 450 people, recently held a four-day meeting at the Zizhong Linka. They listened to reports from the leading group of officials who accompanied the Dalai Lama to Beijing last year and held discussions.

　　At the meeting, Alapei Agwang Jinmei, a representative to the National People's Congress and Kalon of the Tibetan local government, first gave a report on his participation in the First Session of the National People's Congress. This included the State Council's decision to establish the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the decision to assist Tibet in its construction, the agreement reached between the Tibetan local government and the Panchen Kampotilya on historical and pending issues, and the situation and problems regarding the Tibetan local government's request for central government assistance in resolving financial difficulties and reorganizing the Tibetan army. Kalon Suokang Wangqing Gele of the Tibetan local government reported on the Dalai Lama's visits to various parts of the country. Zibon Kaimo Caiwang Dunzhu, Zasa Liuxia Tudeng Taba, Zhuoni Qingbo Pala Tudeng Wudeng, and Gongdelin Zasa Wusi Jincun also reported separately on their respective work and the welcoming of the Dalai Lama and his religious activities during his trip to and from Beijing. Alapei Agwang Jinmei and others pointed out in their reports that the participation of representatives from the Tibet region in the First Session of the National People's Congress, the drafting of the constitution, and the election of national leaders; Chairman Mao's instructions to the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdini; the State Council's Seventh Plenary Session's decisions on Tibetan affairs; and the resolution of historical and pending issues between the Tibetan local government and the Panchen Kampotilya fully demonstrated the central government's and Chairman Mao's deep concern for the Tibet region. It also demonstrated the growing unity between all fraternal nationalities of the motherland, especially between the Han and Tibetan nationalities, and within Tibet itself. The reporters also unanimously pointed out that the Dalai Lama received warm receptions and welcomes from the central government and various localities from the time he left Lhasa until his safe return, and his daily life was meticulously cared for. The Dalai Lama also conducted religious activities in many places, all of which specifically demonstrated that the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government conscientiously implemented the policies of national equality and freedom of religious belief.

　　During the meeting, all the attending officials unanimously expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the central government for its assistance and unparalleled concern for the Tibetan people, and fully endorsed the various decisions made by the State Council's Seventh Plenary Session regarding Tibetan affairs. Assistant Kalon Xiasu Jumo Cairen Dorje, representing the Kashag of the Tibetan local government, expressed agreement with the above reports and thanked the central government for its assistance to the Tibet region. Duwa Khenpo of Drepung Monastery, representing the three major monasteries of Ganden, Sera, and Drepung, expressed support for these reports and expressed gratitude to the central government for the Dalai Lama's safe return to Tibet.
