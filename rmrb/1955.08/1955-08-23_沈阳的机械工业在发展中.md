　　Shenyang's Machinery Industry is Developing
　　Shen Gong
　　Since the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, Shenyang has seen tens of thousands of construction workers engaged in intense labor at hundreds of construction sites, stretching from the towering chimneys of the Tiexi Industrial Zone to the verdant pines of Dongling, from the scenic Beiling to the vast northern bank of the Hun River. Amidst the city's massive economic construction, the machinery industry has experienced particularly remarkable development. China's first modern pneumatic tool factory was completed here in just two years and seven months. The construction of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, equipped with world-class technology, is also nearing completion.

　　In the past two years, more than forty state-owned and local state-owned factories in Shenyang have installed thousands of new machines and equipment. In the machining and assembly workshops of the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, many young men and women are operating new types of machine tools. Here, a large amount of steel is processed daily, producing many excellent products. In the sunlit heat treatment workshop, neatly arranged electric and gas heating furnaces stand in rows, with blowers sending fresh, cold air, completely eradicating the dark, hot, and dusty conditions of the old heat treatment workshops. At the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, the newly installed 2,000-ton hydraulic press forges dozens of tons of steel every day; young machinists stand on the platforms of giant five-meter vertical lathes, machining machine parts weighing several tons.

　　Workers have not only built Shenyang's industry but also begun to master various new machines and equipment. Wang Wenxiang, a young worker at the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory who only had four years of schooling, has learned high school mathematics—trigonometry and geometry—to master the precise coordinate boring machine. Li Dalin, a young worker at the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, and his team studied advanced Soviet technology and quickly learned to use the five-meter vertical lathe, completing eleven months' worth of work quota in four months. Wang Suyun, a rural woman, started mastering the new grinder after only four and a half months.

　　In recent years, the employees of Shenyang City have successfully trial-produced many new products, and several new Soviet-designed products have also been successfully trial-produced in Shenyang. In 1953 and 1954, the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant manufactured 59 types of new heavy machinery for the country. The renovated Pneumatic Tool Factory has produced twelve types of Soviet-style pneumatic tools.

　　In recent years, Shenyang has supported construction in various regions with a large amount of machinery and equipment. If the production of metal cutting machine tools, transformers, water pumps, and rock drills in 1949 is taken as 100, then by 1954, the production of metal cutting machine tools had reached 647.9, transformers had reached 4136.3, water pumps had reached 963.7, and rock drills had reached 6741. To support the construction of China's first iron and steel base, Anshan, Shenyang workers manufactured alloy steel rolls weighing 37.8 tons and a large number of gas gate valves. In 1954, when Anshan Iron and Steel began to renovate its No. 6 automated blast furnace, Shenyang mechanical workers cast the large hopper of the automatic slag car with more than 56,000 catties of molten steel. Shenyang-made electric mud guns for plugging the iron tapping hole are now installed on the blast furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel. In 1954, Shenyang produced a new type of double-spiral classifier, which greatly improved the production efficiency of the ore classification process at the Tongguanshan Mine. In the past two years, Shenyang has manufactured various types of rock drills, ore crushing machinery, deep-well pumps, and conveyors capable of transporting more than 100 tons of coal per hour for the mining industry, replacing heavy manual labor in the mines with modern mechanical equipment. This year, Shenyang has also manufactured new Soviet-style axial flow fans for miners, capable of delivering 700,000 cubic meters of air per hour. Shenyang has also supplied the power industry with a large amount of electrical equipment and machinery. The Foziling Hydropower Station on the Huai River has Shenyang-made water turbines. The newly built 220,000-volt ultra-high-voltage transmission lines in the Northeast have Shenyang-produced steel-cored aluminum stranded wires and many other equipment. Shenyang-produced high and low voltage switches and various types of transformers have been continuously supplied to power industry departments in various regions. In the past two years, Shenyang has also supplied a large amount of machinery, equipment and industrial materials to transportation, water conservancy, textile, paper-making and other sectors.

　　Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and with the help of the people of the whole country and the Soviet people, the working people of Shenyang are victoriously implementing the first Five-Year Plan. They have the confidence and strength to complete the various construction tasks assigned by the state.

　　沈阳的机械工业在发展中
　　沈工
    沈阳自从执行第一个五年计划以来，从烟囱林立的铁西工业区，到苍松葱郁的东陵，从风景优美的北陵到广阔的浑河北岸，在上百处的工地上，数万建设大军在进行着紧张的劳动。在全市规模巨大的经济建设中，机械工业有了特别显著的发展。我国第一座现代化风动工具厂经过两年零七个月的时间就已在这里建成。以世界上第一流技术装备起来的沈阳第一机床厂等的建设工程也已经接近完工。
    两年多以来，沈阳的四十多座国营、地方国营工厂已经安装了成千上万台新式机器设备。在沈阳风动工具厂机械加工和装配车间里，很多男女青年正在操纵着新型机床。这里每天都吞食着大量钢铁，生产出很多优良产品。在充满阳光的热处理车间里，排列着整齐的电气和煤气加热炉，送风机吹送着新鲜的冷空气，旧有热处理车间的阴暗、高热、烟尘四起的遗迹已经彻底根除。在沈阳重型机器厂，新安装的两千吨水压机每天锻压着数十吨的钢材；年轻的车工站在巨型五米立式车床的走廊上加工着数吨重的机器部件。
    工人们不仅建设了沈阳的工业，也开始掌握了各种新型的机器设备。沈阳风动工具厂青年工人王文祥过去只念过四年书，为了掌握精密的座标搪床，他已经学会了高中数学——三角和几何。沈阳重型机器厂青年工人李达林和他领导的小组学习苏联先进技术，很快学会使用五米立式车床，四个月完成了十一个月的工作定额；农村妇女王素玉只经过四个半月，便开始掌握了新式磨床。
    沈阳市的职工们几年来试制成功了许多新产品，几种苏联新设计的产品也已经在沈阳试制成功。沈阳重型机器厂在一九五三和一九五四两年中，为国家制造了五十九种新式重型机械。改建后的风动工具厂已经生产了十二种苏联式风动工具。
    几年来，沈阳以大量的机器设备支援了各地的建设。如果把金属切削机床、变压器、水泵、凿岩机一九四九年的产量作为一百，到一九五四年，金属切削机床的产量已经达到六百四十七点九，变压器达到四千一百三十六点三，水泵达到九百六十三点七，凿岩机达到六千七百四十一。为了支援我国第一个钢铁基地——鞍山的建设，沈阳工人制造了毛重三十七、八吨的合金钢轧辊和大批煤气闸阀。一九五四年鞍钢刚开始改建六号自动化高炉，沈阳机械工人就以五万六千多斤钢水为它铸造了自动铁碴车的大车斗。在鞍钢的高炉上，现在安装着沈阳造的堵铁水口的电动泥炮。一九五四年，沈阳生产了新型双螺旋分级机，它使铜官山选矿厂矿石分级工序的生产效率大大提高。两年多来，沈阳为采矿工业制造了各型凿岩机、矿石破碎机械、深井水泵和每小时能运输一百多吨煤的运输机，以现代化的机械设备代替了矿山中的笨重体力劳动。今年，沈阳又为矿工们制造了苏联新型的轴流通风机，每小时送风量可达七十万立方公尺。沈阳也以大量电气器材和机械设备供应了电力工业。在淮河上佛子岭水力发电站里，有沈阳制造的水轮机。在东北原野上新建成的二十二万伏超高压送电线路上，有沈阳出产的钢心铝绞线和许多其他的器材。沈阳出产的高低压开关、各型变压器源源供应了各地电力工业部门。两年多以来，沈阳也以大量机械设备和工业器材供应了交通运输、水利、纺织、造纸等部门。
    沈阳的劳动人民在党中央和毛主席领导下，在全国人民和苏联人民的帮助下，胜利地执行着第一个五年计划。他们有信心有力量完成国家所交给的各项建设任务。
