To the Editor:

    I am a staff member of the Baoji Work Group of the Kangding-Tibet Highway Administration Bureau. The task of the Kangding-Tibet Highway Administration Bureau is to repair, maintain, and manage the Kangding-Tibet Highway so that this highway can play a greater role in transportation. We know that our work will help to strengthen the ties between the Tibet region and the interior of the motherland, strengthen the unity between the Tibetan people and other ethnic groups in the motherland, and promote the economic and cultural development of the Tibetan people. The people of the whole country give great concern and strong support to our work, which makes us full of confidence to complete the extremely glorious task entrusted to us by the motherland.
    At present, a large number of trucks and other equipment have been transported to Baoji one after another, ready to be transported to Tibet. The relevant departments of Shaanxi Province and Baoji Prefecture attach great importance to the preparation work for the entry of automobiles and equipment into Tibet and have also given us a lot of help. The Baoji Automobile Repair Factory has long prepared sufficient personnel and tools. When the automobiles were just transported to the Baoji Railway Station, the factory's workers unloaded the vehicles day and night and checked them responsibly. They guaranteed that the brand-new automobiles would be delivered to the parking lot intact. The public security department sent people to the parking lot to guard day and night. They said, "We must not let bad elements touch a speck of paint off the new cars." Other units such as the military supply station, Baoji Railway Station, and Baoji Petroleum Company also gave us a lot of assistance and care. Therefore, many problems in our work can be solved in a timely and proper manner.
    Workers in the transportation departments of various provinces and cities have asked to participate in the work of the Kangding-Tibet Highway. More than 100 drivers from the Liaoning Provincial Transportation Bureau in Northeast China and from Jiangsu Province on the shores of the Yellow Sea have already reported to Baoji. Among them, many are model workers or advanced workers, and many are Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. They have a common ideal—to devote all their strength to the prosperity and happiness of Tibet.
    We will use our practical actions in doing our work well to thank the people of the motherland for their support. We must victoriously complete the task of maintaining and managing the Kangding-Tibet Highway so that the vehicles of national unity can speed across the Tibetan Plateau.

    让民族团结的车辆奔驰在康藏高原上编辑同志：
    我是康藏公路管理局宝鸡工作组的工作人员。康藏公路管理局的任务，是对康藏公路进行整修、养护和管理，使这条公路在交通运输上起更大的作用。我们知道，我们的工作将有助于密切西藏地方和祖国内地的联系、加强藏族和祖国其他民族间的团结以及促进西藏人民的经济和文化事业的发展。全国人民对我们的工作给予极大的关怀和有力的支援，这使我们信心百倍地来完成祖国交给我们的极其光荣的任务。
    目前，大批载重汽车和其他设备器材已经先后运到宝鸡，准备继续运往西藏。陕西省和宝鸡专区的有关部门对汽车和器材的进藏准备工作十分重视，也给了我们很多的帮助。宝鸡汽车修理厂早就准备了充足的人员和工具，当汽车刚运到宝鸡车站时，这个厂的职工就夜以继日地卸车，认真负责地检查，他们保证要把崭新的汽车完好无缺地送到停车场。公安部门派人到停车场，昼夜警卫，他们说：“决不能让坏分子碰掉新车的一沫油漆。”其他像军事供应站、宝鸡铁路车站、宝鸡市石油公司等单位，同样也给我们许多援助和照顾。因此，我们工作中的许多问题都能够及时、妥善地得到了解决。
    各省、市的运输部门的职工，纷纷要求参加康藏公路的工作。现在已经到宝鸡报到的有来自祖国东北的辽宁省运输局的司机和来自黄海之滨的江苏省的司机共一百多人。他们中间，很多人是劳动模范或先进工作者，很多人是共产党员和青年团员。他们有一个共同的理想——为了西藏的繁荣和幸福，决心付出自己的全部力量。
    我们要用做好工作的实际行动来答谢祖国人民的支援。我们一定要胜利地完成康藏公路的养护管理任务，让民族团结的车辆奔驰在康藏高原上。
                                      戴维熙
