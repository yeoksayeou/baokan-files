Yueyang Tower Refurbished with a Fresh New Look

    Yueyang Tower, a famous historical site in Hunan Province, has been renovated by the local government and now has a brand-new appearance. The previously collapsed southern embankment has been completely repaired. The main Yueyang Tower building and the side pavilions such as the San Sui Pavilion and Xian Mei Pavilion have been painted and varnished, and electric lights have been installed. The ground around Yueyang Tower has been paved with cement to protect the foundations. The Yueyang County Cultural Center has also established a cultural service center in the tower.
    Yueyang Tower was built more than 1,100 years ago by the Tang Dynasty poet Zhang Shuo. It is located northwest of Yueyang County, Hunan Province, facing Dongting Lake. Standing on the tower, one can overlook the vast and magnificent scenery of Dongting Lake.

　　岳阳楼经过修理面貌一新
    湖南省著名古迹岳阳楼最近由当地政府修理后，面貌一新。原来倒塌的南边堤岸已全部经过整修，岳阳楼正楼和楼侧的三碎亭、仙梅亭等都经过粉刷、油漆，并安装了电灯。岳阳楼四周地面上全都铺了水泥，保护楼基。岳阳县文化馆还在楼里设立了文化服务处。
    岳阳楼是一千一百多年前唐代诗人张说修建的位置在湖南岳阳县的西北，面临洞庭湖，站在楼上可眺望广阔、雄壮的洞庭湖景色。
