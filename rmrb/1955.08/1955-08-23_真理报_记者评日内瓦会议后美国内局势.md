Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 20th: "Pravda" published an article by its New York correspondent, Litoshenko, commenting on the domestic situation in the United States after the Geneva Conference.

Litoshenko said that the American Institute of Public Opinion conducted a national poll to determine the attitude of Americans towards the Geneva Conference resolutions. The director of the Institute, Gallup, said that the test results showed that "the Four Power Conference confirmed the hopes of the people. ... The vast majority of Americans believe that the Geneva Conference will lead to a relaxation of international tensions and increased cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States."

In American political life, there is currently a clear trend developing towards strengthening peace and easing international tensions. The principle of peaceful negotiation has triumphed over the policy of "strength" in Geneva. This is the inevitable conclusion reached by all clear-headed people in the United States.

After the Geneva Conference, interest in developing economic, scientific, and cultural contacts with the Soviet Union has increased in the United States. Many representatives of the American business community, who are not interested in war, are increasingly insisting on expanding trade with the Soviet Union on the basis of mutual benefit.

Speaking of the Sino-American talks, Litoshenko said that after the Geneva Four-Power Conference, it has become particularly obvious to many Americans how unjust it is that the great Chinese people have not yet occupied their legitimate seat in the United Nations.

All of this shows that the ideas of peace, cooperation, and strengthening trust in international relations are being enthusiastically embraced by the American people. These ideas are reflected in the activities of representatives of those groups in the United States who are striving not to lag behind real life and advocate a new, constructive policy that conforms to the spirit of the Geneva Conference resolutions. They recognize that there are still obstacles on the road to achieving stable peace, but that these obstacles can be overcome if both sides show sincerity and a genuine desire for cooperation.

Some groups in the United States are still extremely reluctant to abandon the policies of hostility, suspicion, and the "Cold War." However, these groups do not receive reliable support. The shameful failure of the notorious Senator McCarthy, who maliciously attacked the Geneva Conference resolutions, is a lesson. But the gloomy and dejected advocates – as Americans aptly call those who advocate the "Cold War" – have been plotting against the cause of peace. They are unwilling to tolerate the possibility of further easing of the world situation. For them, the "Cold War" and the arms race are a source of profit. However, the interests of the arms dealers have nothing in common with the interests of the American people. For the American people, the arms race has no benefits. There is no doubt that in the struggle between the forces of peace and the forces of war that is now taking place in the United States, the warriors of peace will certainly win.

### “真理报”记者评日内瓦会议后美国内局势

　　“真理报”记者评日内瓦会议后美国内局势
    新华社二十一日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：“真理报”刊载了驻纽约记者利托希科的一篇文章，评论日内瓦会议以后美国国内的局势。
    利托希科说，美国民意研究所举行了一次全国民意测验，以确定美国人对日内瓦会议决议的态度。研究所所长盖洛普说，测验结果表明，“四大国会议证实了人民的希望。……绝大多数美国人认为，日内瓦会议将导致国际紧张局势的缓和和苏美两国之间的合作的加强。”
    在美国的政治生活中，目前正有一种要求加强和平和缓和国际紧张局势的明显趋势在发展。和平谈判的原则已经在日内瓦战胜“实力地位”政策，这就是美国一切头脑清醒的人不可避免地得出的结论。
    在日内瓦会议以后，美国国内对于发展同苏联的经济、科学和文化的接触的兴趣已经增加了。许多对战争不感兴趣的美国商业界代表人物正在越来越坚持地提出在互利的基础上扩大同苏联的贸易的要求。
    利托希科在谈到中美会谈时说，在日内瓦四国会议以后，伟大的中国人民还没有占有它在联合国中的合法地位这一事实是多么不公正，对于许多美国人说来也变得特别明显了。
    所有这一切表明，和平、合作以及加强国际关系中的信任的思想正在得到美国人民的热烈拥护。这些思想在美国那些正在努力不落后于现实生活并且主张奉行一种符合日内瓦会议决议的精神的新的建设性的政策的集团的代表的活动中得到了反映。他们认识到，在通向取得稳定的和平的道路上还存在着种种障碍，但是，如果双方都表现出诚意和对合作的真诚愿望，那么这些障碍是能够克服的。
    美国某些集团目前还极不愿意放弃仇视、怀疑和“冷战”的政策。然而这些集团得不到可靠的支持。恶意攻击日内瓦会议决议的臭名远扬的参议员麦卡锡的可耻的失败就是一个教训。但是，黯淡和沮丧的拥护者们——美国人很适当地这样称呼主张
  “冷战”的人们——却一直在进行反对和平事业的阴谋。他们不愿意忍受世界局势进一步缓和的可能性。对他们说来，“冷战”和军备竞赛是利润的来源。但是，军火商人的利益同美国人民的利益是没有丝毫共同之处的。对美国人民说来，军备竞赛并没有任何好处。毫无疑问，在现在正在美国进行的和平力量与战争势力之间的斗争中，和平战士们肯定地将赢得胜利。
