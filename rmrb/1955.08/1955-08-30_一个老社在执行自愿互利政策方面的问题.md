　　Problems of an Old Cooperative in Implementing the Policy of Voluntary Mutual Benefit
　　Wei Qiang, Dian Lin
　　In order to understand the implementation of the voluntary mutual benefit policy in agricultural production cooperatives, the Communist Party Committee of Hunyuan County recently sent us to the Shangxin'an Village Agricultural Production Cooperative for an investigation.
　　Shangxin'an Village is a medium-sized village in Hunyuan County. The Party's foundation in this village is relatively strong, and the agricultural cooperativization movement has developed rapidly. When the cooperative was established in 1953, it had seventeen households. Now it has developed into a large cooperative with one hundred and twenty-seven households, with cooperative member households accounting for 83.5 percent of the total households in the village.
　　The inspection began with production. At the cooperative affairs committee meeting, we first learned about the cooperative's production situation. When talking about increasing production measures, the cooperative affairs committee members said in unison, "If we want to increase production on this hillside of barren land, we must apply more fertilizer and do more processing." We asked, "How are these two tasks going this year?" Deputy Director Ren Zuo said, "This year the sheep are dying severely. Since last year, more than ninety sheep, large and small, have died. I'm afraid the fertilizer will not be as good as last year." Has it increased or decreased compared to last year? The cooperative affairs committee members had different opinions. So, we asked the accountant to take out the accounts and calculate: This year, the fertilizer invested by the members and the urban manure bought by the cooperative totaled more than 14,000 loads. The cooperative has 3,900 mu of land, averaging only 3.67 loads per mu; last year, it averaged 4.3 loads per mu. Regarding land processing, taking harrowing the land as an example, this year only 16 percent of the total land area has been completed. Of the 3,900 mu of land in the cooperative, only 640 mu have been harrowed. The production organization within the cooperative is not good, and a large amount of labor is flowing out, affecting weeding. During the spring and summer seasons, more than half of the total labor force of 133 in the cooperative went out to work, and as of now, there are still 41 laborers who have not returned from outside. After presenting these problems, the cooperative affairs committee members unanimously agreed that the production plan for this year is in danger of failing. Speaking of this, Deputy Director Yang Baosen said, "The main problem is the members' thinking. If we can't defeat selfishness, we can't work well in the cooperative, so how can we increase production? Take sowing as an example, isn't the reason for not completing the plan because the members are not investing?" At the time, we were half-doubtful of this statement. After in-depth work, we found that the basic problem was not "selfishness," but that the Party organization in the village, in dealing with the vital economic interests of the farmers who joined the cooperative, violated the spirit of the voluntary mutual benefit policy and democratic consultation, and wrongly treated the middle peasants.
　　First, let's talk about the income distribution in 1954. The harvest this year was slightly lower than in the past, but the year was not very bad. The cooperative affairs committee members, however, used the excuse of disaster affecting labor dividends, and unreasonably withheld more than 16,000 jin of grain, preparing it for use as relief for poor cooperative members and other contingency uses in the coming year. When setting aside production reserves, only over 7,000 jin were actually needed for seeds alone, but more than 11,000 jin were set aside.
　　The remuneration for means of production also excessively infringed upon the interests of the middle peasants. First of all, land remuneration was reduced year by year. In 1953, land remuneration accounted for 34 percent of the assessed yield upon joining the cooperative, which was reduced to 31 percent in 1954, and further reduced to 28 percent this year. Some members said, "After paying agricultural tax, we only get a handful of chaff." The method of reducing the price of fertilizer year by year was also adopted. On the issue of assessing the price of means of production such as donkey saddles and pockets upon joining the cooperative, the price was generally reduced by about 50 percent compared to the original price.
　　Even more serious was the blind implementation of sheep flock cooperation regardless of conditions. In July 1954, after Director Ren Xianzhang and Production Team Leader Jing Decai visited the Qiaomai Chuan Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in the county, they returned to the village and inventoried the members' sheep, preparing them for joining the cooperative next year. In Li Ju Village, not far from Shangxin'an, member Wu Zhiyun had more than 30 sheep. Hearing that they were to join the cooperative, he sent ten sheep to relatives in Gao Ju Village. After the director discovered this, he had the shepherd Sun Yuguo drive the remaining twenty-odd sheep completely into the cooperative, joining the cooperative ahead of schedule. In order to prevent members from sending sheep out, they mistakenly withheld 29,000 jin of sheep grass and more than 9,000 jin of sheep feed that should have been distributed to the members, and the members had to collect grass and feed from the cooperative every day. The cooperative stipulated that feeding one dan (about 30 jin) of straw cost 1 jiao 3 fen, and one sheng of feed cost 2 jiao 4 fen, and the money would be settled and repaid after the sheep joined the cooperative.
　　The losses caused by violating the voluntary mutual benefit policy are immeasurable. Middle peasant members have many doubts about the current policy of the cooperative movement, and their thinking is unstable. Several middle peasant members, such as Li You, Ren Zhen, and Bai Yinchuan, often discussed it in secret. Once, while working in the fields, Ren Zhen said, "Our saddles have been in the cooperative for three years, and there's no mention of repayment. I've seen through it." Wen Ru said, "I don't feel like accumulating manure anymore." Li Yin said, "The policy is just words. Don't bother thinking about 'voluntary mutual benefit.' Just endure it once or twice, and that's it! I won't bother calculating what's in the cooperative anymore." Some members even refuse to repair their broken houses, fearing "unified distribution." Especially last autumn, after the announcement of sheep flock joining the cooperative, the production enthusiasm of middle peasant members was greatly reduced. Ren Simin's ewe gave birth to two lambs, which froze to death in the pen, and he didn't care. Since the announcement of sheep flock joining the cooperative, Liu Kuan didn't put a load of soil in the pen, and the sheep were so thin they were unrecognizable. Almost no one collected manure last winter. The amount of fertilizer applied in the entire cooperative has also decreased year by year. In 1953, the average was 5.7 loads per mu, last year it was 4.3 loads per mu, and this year it is only 3.67 loads per mu.

　　This approach has its ideological roots among the core members of the cooperative. For example, Branch Secretary and Director Ren Xianzhang, Deputy Director Ren Zuo, Village Director and Deputy Director Yang Baosen, etc., lack a comprehensive understanding of the Party's class policy. In their actual work, they one-sidedly take care of the poor peasants, have a rigid style, and can't wait to get rid of the members' private psychology in one morning. For example, during the distribution last year, they withheld 30 percent of the investment and 0.5 percent of the land remuneration on the grounds of disaster, preparing to provide relief to poor cooperative members. After the leadership discovered this, they asked them to correct it, but they did not implement it. They sold the grain, distributed the cash equally according to labor days, and used the remaining 208 jin of grain to provide relief to poor peasant members. The original stipulation for renting livestock was that the offspring belonged to the livestock owner. After member Ren Zhen's donkey gave birth to a foal, it was supposed to be weaned after six months, but they used the excuse of hindering production and wanted to return it after three months, not allowing it to see the big donkey again. Ren Zhen had no choice but to give the foal to the cooperative for free. The shepherds Sun Yuguo and Liu Shangda are poor peasants, and the stipulated wages for herding were too high. In neighboring villages, the annual wage for one sheep is one big dou of coarse grain, but they stipulated one dou and 3.5 sheng. After the members distributed the grain according to the number of people, the wages should have been paid in cash, but they advocated giving grain. When the members' representative meeting was convened to solve this problem, the cooperative affairs committee members also criticized not giving grain to the sheep-raising households as "capitalist ideology."
　　Another reason for violating the policy is that the resident staff members have the problem of subjectivism, lacking in-depth investigation and research, and only handling affairs based on subjective wishes. For example, on the issue of sheep flocks joining the cooperative, they started from the subjective wishes of "solving the contradiction between agriculture and animal husbandry; accumulating more fertilizer; increasing the reproduction rate," without studying whether the two basic conditions of production needs and member awareness were met, and acted blindly. According to our interviews and understanding, before the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were more than 600 sheep in the village, but only about 40 remained before liberation. Now there are a total of 241 sheep, large and small, averaging 1.5 per household and 0.35 per person. The development of sheep flocks has not yet reached the pre-war level, and there is no "contradiction between agriculture and animal husbandry" at all. Wu Zhilu, a member of Li Ju Village, living less than a mile away from Shangxin'an, has five brothers in his family, a total of 26 people, and raises 31 sheep. When we interviewed his family and brought up the issue of sheep flocks joining the cooperative last year, Wu Zhixiang's daughter-in-law said, "They (referring to the cooperative affairs committee members) are too ruthless. They drove our sheep away before we could raise them properly." His uncle, Wu Fu, said, "When the sheep were at home, they didn't need adults to take care of them, and they were fed fat and plump. The grandchildren loved the sheep very much, and fed them with whatever they could eat, and pulled some good grass for them to eat in the summer." The old man then sighed and said, "We fed them together for a winter, and none of them gave birth, but five died, and the remaining ones are so thin that they are unrecognizable; they have only been fed salt four or five times in half a year (feeding sheep salt can make them drink more water and get sick less often)." We also interviewed the shepherd Sun Yuguo, who learned that the mortality rate of sheep is very high since the announcement of sheep flock cooperation. Before the implementation of sheep flock cooperation last autumn, there were a total of 242 sheep, large and small, in the entire village, and now there are only 214 left; it will definitely decrease further after autumn. Because the cooperative has no breeding sheep, there are more than 20 ewes that can give birth to two litters, but now they are all empty; some will also be slaughtered and sold after autumn.
　　The facts ruthlessly shattered their subjective wishes. Fertilizer did not increase but decreased, and the reproduction rate of sheep did not increase but decreased!
　　There are also many problems with the annual reduction of land remuneration and fertilizer prices. When the average ratio of fixed land remuneration in 1953 was 34 percent, the income of middle and poor peasant members changed as follows: Zhao Xuan, a household with little land and more labor, had 27 mu of land and three laborers. His income before joining the cooperative in 1952 was 223 yuan; in 1953 it was 334 yuan, an increase of 49.7 percent; Bai Yingchuan, a household with more land and less labor, had 46 mu of land and one laborer. His income in 1952 was 260 yuan, and in 1953 it was 272 yuan, an increase of 4.6 percent. Obviously, this will affect the production enthusiasm of middle peasant members. The cooperative affairs committee members subjectively believed that "gradually reducing land dividends is in line with the laws of development," but did not study the impact of such a rigid reduction.

　　× × ×
　　When we started inspecting the work of the cooperative, the cooperative affairs committee members avoided talking about these issues. Some people knew that they had made mistakes and were afraid of being criticized; some people had insufficient understanding and let go of some issues that should have been raised. After we initially grasped the clues, we held five small-scale forums with poor and middle peasants one after another, and individually interviewed some members, before we were able to clarify all the problems. After preliminary analysis and sorting, we convened a meeting of the Party branch committee, explained the nature of the problems and their harm, and improved the ideological understanding of Party members and cadres. Bai Zengshan, the secretary of the general branch, reviewed: "In the past, I didn't truly understand the importance of the voluntary mutual benefit policy, and only focused on taking care of the poor peasants. I also knew that the price of fertilizer was too low, but at the time, I only listened to the opinions of the poor peasants opposing the increase, and let it go lightly. I 'played deaf and dumb' to the reactions of the middle peasants." After the meeting, everyone expressed their determination to study the Party's policy, improve their work, and consolidate the cooperative. After the Party's internal thinking was unified, another forum was held with poor peasants to explain the truth and the stakes to them on some policy issues that needed to be corrected. They realized that taking care of the interests of the middle peasants was very necessary; however, some people were still worried about whether their income would decrease as a result. After calculating the overall account for them, they understood that the development of production in the entire cooperative would increase their income, which was actually beneficial and harmless. After doing this work, the past deviations in policy implementation were corrected through a general meeting of all members. First, more than 1,000 yuan in cash from the sale of grain from the investment and land remuneration unreasonably withheld in the last distribution was returned to the people who should have received it. Then, the production reserves needed for the entire cooperative this year were allocated according to 70 percent of the land and 30 percent of the labor force. The excess part will be returned after autumn, and the shortfall will be supplemented in full, in large part, or in small part after autumn, depending on his living conditions. The ratio of fixed land remuneration and fertilizer prices will remain no lower than last year. It was affirmed that sheep flocks will not join the cooperative now. The sheep that have already been collectively returned to the cooperative will still be fed by their owners. The sheep grass withheld last year will be distributed to the members according to the labor days without compensation. The part of the means of production (such as donkey saddles and pockets) that has been priced and returned to the cooperative will be solved by allocating share funds. The part exceeding the price will be returned by the cooperative from the public accumulation fund within three years. Those who have not received any repayment after three years will be repaid two-thirds this autumn, and the remaining part will be repaid next year. Through the correction of these deviations, the voluntary mutual benefit policy was thoroughly and meticulously explained. The Party branch committee members and the cooperative affairs committee members also reviewed the shortcomings of their past working methods.
　　Now the production enthusiasm of the members has been improved, and a new atmosphere of united production has emerged in the cooperative. Middle peasant Wu Youzhen said, "I can finally rest assured!" Jing Decai said, "I will collect manure from now on. Whatever I collect is mine." Middle peasant Li Yin used to have low production enthusiasm and had only done 32 labor days since the beginning of spring; he caught a cold in his leg a few days ago, but the day after the members' meeting, he put on cotton pants and went to hoe the fields, saying, "I must catch up with those who have done more labor days." The general meeting of all members approved the accumulation of more than 1,300 loads of fertilizer for top dressing, and a labor competition was launched among the production teams to strive for the realization of the production increase plan.

　　一个老社在执行自愿互利政策方面的问题
　　维强　殿林
    中共浑源县委为了了解农业生产合作社执行自愿互利政策方面的情况，最近派我们到上辛安村农业生产合作社作了一次考察。
    上辛安村是浑源县的一个中等村庄，这个村党的基础较强，农业合作化运动发展很快，一九五三年建社时十七户，现在已发展成一百二十七户的大社，入社农户占全村总农户的百分之八十三点五。
    检查工作是从生产入手的。在社务委员会上首先了解社的生产情况。当谈到增产措施时，社务委员异口同声地说：“我们这山坡薄地想增产就得多施肥和多加工。”我们问：“今年这两种工作搞的怎样呢？”副社长任佐说：“今年羊死的厉害，去年到现在大小羊已死了九十多只了，肥料恐怕不如去年。”到底比去年增多了？还是减少了？社务委员意见分歧。于是让会计员拿出账来算：今年社员投入的肥料和社内买的城粪共一万四千多驮，全社三千九百亩土地，每亩平均才三驮六七；去年每亩平均四驮三。土地加工问题，拿耙耱地来说，今年只完成总土地面积的百分之十六，全社三千九百亩土地，只耙耱过六百四十亩。社内生产组织不好，劳动力大量外流，影响锄苗，春、夏二季前后外出劳力占全社总劳力一百三十三个的一半多，直到现在外边还有四十一个劳力没回来。摆出这些问题后，社务委员一致认为今年增产计划有落空的危险。谈到这里，副社长杨宝森说：“主要是社员思想成问题，打不倒自私自利，在社内不好好干，还能增产？拿播种说，完不成计划还不是因为社员不投资吗？”这种说法当时我们半信半疑。经过深入工作之后，发现基本的问题并不是什么“自私自利”，而是该村党的组织在处理入社农民的切身经济利益问题时，违反了自愿互利政策和民主协商的精神，错误地对待了中农。
    先说说一九五四年的收益分配问题。这一年收成稍低于过去，但年景也并不很坏，社务委员却借口遭灾，影响劳动分红，就无理扣留下一万六千多斤粮食，准备作为来年救济贫困社员和其他机动使用。在预留生产底垫时，只籽种一项，实际只需要七千多斤，却留了一万一千多斤。
    在生产资料的报酬上也过分地侵犯了中农利益。首先是土地报酬逐年降低，一九五三年土地报酬占入社评产量的百分之三十四，一九五四年降为百分之三十一，今年又降低为百分之二十八。有的社员说：“除交农业税只落一把乱糠。”对肥料作价也采取了逐年降低的办法。驴鞍和口袋等生产资料入社作价问题上，一般比原价降低百分之五十左右。
    更严重的是不顾条件盲目实行羊群合作。一九五四年七月间，社长任宪章、生产队长靖德才参观了县内荞麦川农林牧生产合作社之后，回村即清点了社员的羊，准备来年入社。离上辛安不远的李咀属村，社员吴智运有三十多只羊，听说要入社，把羊寄到高咀村亲戚家十只，社长发觉后，让放羊工人孙玉国把他们剩下的二十多只完全赶到社内，提早入了社。为了避免社员往外寄羊，并错误地把应分给社员的羊草二万九千斤，羊料九千多斤扣到社内，社员天天向社领草料。社里规定喂一担（大约三十斤）秸草一角三分，一升料二角四分，等羊入社后结账还款。
    由于违反自愿互利政策所造成的损失是难以估量的。中农社员对合作化运动的现行政策有很多疑虑，思想动荡不安。李有、任真、白银川等几个中农社员经常背地议论，有一次在田间劳动时任真说：“咱们的鞍子归社三年了，还款的事一字不提，我看完啦。”温如说：“我也再没心思积粪了。”李银说：“政策还不是嘴说的，不用思谋‘自愿互利’，一忍二忍，忍了就算啦！入了社的东西我就再不盘算了。”还有个别社员房子破了也不修理，怕“统一分配”。特别是去年秋季，宣布羊群入社后，中农社员的生产积极性大大降低了。任四敏的母羊下了两个羔子，冻死在圈里也不管。刘宽自宣布羊群入社后，圈里一驮土未垫，羊瘦的不成样子。去冬几乎没人拾粪。全社的施肥量也逐年降低。一九五三年每亩平均五点七驮，去年平均四点三驮，今年只平均三点六七驮。
            ×××
    这种作法，在社的骨干分子中是有它的思想根源的。如支部书记兼社长任宪章，副社长任佐，村主任兼副社长杨宝森等，对党的阶级政策缺乏全面理解。他们在实际工作中片面地照顾贫农，作风生硬，恨不得一个早上就把社员的私有心理去搞掉。如去年分配时，借口遭灾扣下百分之三十的投资和百分之零点五的土地报酬，准备救济贫困社员。领导方面发觉后，要他们纠正，他们没有执行，把粮卖了，现金又按劳动日平均分配了，并把剩下的二百零八斤粮救济了贫农社员。租用牲口原规定生下小畜归畜主，社员任真的驴，生下驴驹后，本来六个月才能离奶，他们借口妨碍生产，三个月后就要退回，再不让见大驴，任真万般无奈，只好把小驴驹白送给社。放羊工人孙玉国、刘尚达是贫农，放牧工资规定偏高。邻村一只羊一年工资是一大斗粗粮，他们则规定一斗三升五。社员按人分粮后，工资理应给款，他们却主张给粮。召开社员代表会解决这个问题时，社务委员还批评不给养羊户粮食是“资本主义思想”。
    违背政策的另一个原因是驻社工作人员有主观主义的毛病，缺乏深入的调查研究，只凭主观愿望办事。比如羊群入社问题，他们单从“解决农、牧业矛盾；多积肥；增加繁殖率”的主观愿望出发，不去研究是否具备生产需要和社员觉悟这两个基本条件，盲目行动。据我们访问了解：抗日战争以前该村有六百多只羊，到解放前只剩下四十多只。现在大小羊共计二百四十一只，每户平均一只半，每人平均○点三五只。羊群的发展还没达到战前水平，这里根本没有出现什么“农牧业矛盾”的问题。住在离上辛安一里以外的李咀属村社员吴智禄兄弟五人，全家二十六口，养羊三十一只。当我们访问他家扯起去年羊群入社的时候，吴智祥的媳妇说：“他们（指社务委员）太厉害啦，俺们的几个羊还没养过新鲜去就赶走了。”他的叔翁吴福老汉说：“羊在家的时候用不着大人管，也喂的又肥又胖，小孙孙们挺爱羊，有点吃的就喂了它，夏天还给它拔些好草吃。”老汉接着叹息说：“一块儿喂了一冬天，一个没生，却死了五个，剩下的也瘦得不像样子了；半年了才喂过四、五次盐（羊喂盐可以多喝水，少生病）”。我们又访问了放羊工人孙玉国，得知自宣布羊群合作后，羊死亡率是很高的。去年秋天实行羊群合作以前，全村共有大小羊二百四十二只，现在只剩下二百一十四只；到秋后肯定还会减少。因为该社没有种羊，有二十多只能下二茬羔子的母羊，现在都空怀；秋后还会有一部分杀卖的。
    事实无情地粉碎了他们的主观愿望。肥料不是增多而是减少了，羊的繁殖率没有增加，反而降低了！
    逐年降低土地报酬和肥料价格问题也很多。一九五三年土地固定报酬的比例平均占百分之三十四的时候，中贫农社员的收入有这样变化：地少劳力多户赵宣，二十七亩地，三个劳力，一九五二年入社前收入为二百二十三元；一九五三年为三百三十四元，增加收入百分之四十九点七；地多劳力少户白英川，四十六亩土地，一个劳力，一九五二年收入为二百六十元，一九五三年为二百七十二元，增加收入百分之四点六。显然这样是会影响中农社员的生产情绪的。社务委员主观认为“逐年降低土地分红合乎发展规律”，却不去研究这样硬性降低的影响如何。
            ×　×　×
    我们开始检查该社工作时，社务委员避而不谈这类问题。有些人知道自己做错了怕受批评；有些人认识不足，把一些应该说的问题放过去了。我们初步掌握了线索后，先后召开了五次小型的贫中农座谈会，个别访问了一些社员，才把问题全部搞清。经过初步分析整理，召开了党支部委员会，说明问题的实质及其危害性，提高党员干部思想认识，总支书记白增山检讨：“过去没真正懂得自愿互利政策的重要，只偏重照顾贫农。肥料作价我也知道太低，但当时只听贫农的意见反对提高，就轻轻放过去了。对中农的反映则是‘装聋推哑’。”会后大家表示决心学习党的政策，改进工作，把社巩固起来。党内思想统一后，又召开了一次贫农座谈会，对需要纠正的一些政策问题，向他们讲清道理，说明利害。他们认识到照顾中农利益是很必要的；但是有些人还顾虑这样作是不是自己的收入会减少？经过给他们算大账，他们了解到全社生产发展，自己收入就会增多，实际是有利无害的。做了这些工作以后，又通过全体社员大会，对过去在执行政策中的一些偏差作了纠正。首先把去年分配中不合理扣下的投资和土地报酬的粮食卖的一千多元现金，照旧归还原应分得人，再将全社今年所需的生产底垫按土地百分之七十、劳力百分之三十分摊，超出部分秋后归还，不足的秋后看他的生活情况补全部、大部或少部。土地固定报酬的比例和肥料价格仍保持不低于去年。对羊群肯定现在不入社，已集体归社的羊，仍归本主自喂，去年扣下的羊草无代价按劳动日分给社员。已作价入社的部分生产资料（如驴鞍、口袋）用分摊股份基金的办法解决，超过作价部分在三年内由社从公积金内归还，已经够三年一文未还者，今年秋后归还三分之二，下余明年还清。通过对这些偏差的纠正，深入细致地交代了自愿互利政策。党支部委员、社务委员对过去工作方法的缺点也作了检讨。
    现在社员生产积极性提高了，社内出现了团结生产的新气象。中农吴有真说：“这一下我才放心啦！”靖德才说：“以后拾粪吧，拾下就是东西。”中农李银过去因生产情绪不高，入春到现在只做了三十二个劳动日；前几日腿上中了风，但开完社员大会的第二天就穿上棉裤锄田去了，并说：“一定要赶上劳动日多的。”全体社员大会通过再积肥一千三百多驮作追肥，各生产队间展开了劳动竞赛，争取增产计划实现。
