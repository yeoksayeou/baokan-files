    Saving Food is Everyone's Responsibility
    To the Editors:
    After education on saving food, most government offices, enterprises, and schools located in Beijing's Dongdan District have greatly reduced food waste. However, there are still quite a few units where the phenomenon of waste is quite serious.

    Some units have a serious problem with food being thrown away in their canteens. In the Beijing Automobile Repair Factory, after every meal, a lot of rice grains and noodles are always spilled on the tables, the floor, around the drains, and in the sinks; the leftover rice grains swept down by the cooks when wiping tables and washing dishes amount to more than a pound. After meals at the construction site 4512 of the Second Work Zone of the Beijing Fifth Construction Engineering Company, the floor of the dining hall is covered with cornbread crumbs. The Dongdan District Health Clinic has a slogan on the wall that says "Do not waste a single grain of rice," but after meals, the rice grains spilled on the tables and floor are too numerous to count; the leftover steamed buns and cornbread from individual staff members are enough for two cooks to eat.

    Some units even throw rice, steamed buns, bread, and other foods into the trash cans. For example, the cafeteria of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese throws away enough rice and dishes every day to feed four or five people for a day. The cafeteria of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace also often throws away food; on July 22 alone, they threw away a total of ten whole and half loaves of bread and steamed buns. The cafeteria of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association also frequently throws cornbread, steamed buns, etc., into the trash cans. After the comrades from the Dongdan District Cleaning Team discovered this, they put the discarded food in the reception rooms or general affairs sections of these units, hoping to draw their attention, but these units still showed no improvement.

    Some units use the large amounts of leftover food to make sauce or feed pigs. The construction site 4512 of the Second Work Zone of the Beijing Fifth Construction Engineering Company used leftover cornbread to make several vats of sauce. The Beijing No. 26 Middle School uses leftover rice to feed pigs; on one occasion, four steamed buns, three cornbread buns, and half a shovel of rice were scooped out of a half-cut gasoline barrel of pig feed.

    At present, the people of the whole country are working hard to save food. Why are the above-mentioned units still wasting food at will? We hope that the leading staff of these units will pay attention to this matter and earnestly check and correct the behavior of wasting food.

### 北京东单区仍有不少单位浪费粮食

    节约粮食，人人有责
    北京东单区仍有不少单位浪费粮食编辑同志：
    驻在北京市东单区的大部分机关、企业和学校，经过节约粮食的教育以后，浪费粮食的现象已经大大减少了。但是，还有不少单位仍然存在着相当严重的浪费现象。
    有些单位食堂里丢饭现象很严重。北京汽车修配厂，每顿饭后饭桌上、地上、水沟周围和洗手池里总是洒了很多饭粒、面条；炊事员抹桌洗碗时刷下的饭粒就有一斤多。北京第五建筑工程公司第二工区四五一二工地吃过饭后，饭厅地下遍地都是窝头渣。东单区卫生所的墙上贴着“不浪费一粒米”的标语，但是饭后桌上、地上洒的饭粒却数也数不清；个别工作人员吃剩下的馒头、窝头，就足够两个炊事员吃的。
    有些单位竟把米饭、馒头、面包等食物扔在垃圾箱里。例如归国华侨联谊会的食堂每天倒在垃圾箱里的米饭和菜足够四、五个人吃一天的。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的食堂也常常把饭菜倒掉，仅七月二十二日一天就倒出整个的和半个的面包、馒头共十个。中苏友好协会总会的食堂也经常把窝头、馒头等扔在垃圾箱里。东单区清洁队的同志发现后把扔掉的食物放在这些机关的传达室或总务科门口，想引起他们的重视，但是仍不见这些机关有什么改进。
    有的单位用剩下的大量食物作酱，喂猪。北京市第五建筑工程公司第二工区四五一二工地用剩窝头作了几缸酱。北京市第二十六中学用剩饭喂猪，有一次在一个半截汽油桶的猪食中就捞出了四个馒头、三个窝头和半铁锹米饭。
    目前全国人民都在为节约粮食而努力，为什么上述这些单位还在任意糟踏粮食呢？希望这些单位的领导工作人员重视这件事情，切实检查和纠正浪费粮食的行为。
