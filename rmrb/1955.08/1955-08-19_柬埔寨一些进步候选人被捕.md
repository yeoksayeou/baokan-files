　　On August 5th, Sok Sophei, the People's Party candidate in the Memot area of Kampong Cham province, was unreasonably arrested by the Royal Government and imprisoned in the prison of Svay Rieng. Two or three days before Sok Sophei's arrest, the Royal Government police also arrested Bin, a propagandist for the People's Party in Svay Rieng, because Bin exposed to the people the negative consequences of the US-Cambodian military "aid" agreement.

　　The "Nationalist" newspaper pointed out that the above-mentioned actions of the Cambodian Royal Government are contrary to the constitution. It suggested that the Royal Government take correct measures to ensure the realization of the constitution and the conduct of the election campaign.
　　The "Nationalist" newspaper also suggested that the Cambodian International Supervisory Commission supervise the general election so that the general election can comply with the provisions of the Geneva Accords.

    柬埔寨一些进步候选人被捕
    新华社河内十八日电　柬埔寨消息：当竞选活动正在展开的时候，人民派的一些候选人遭到了王国政府的逮捕。
    八月五日，人民派在磅湛省棉末地区的候选人索沙菲被王国政府无理逮捕，并且被关进苏恩的监狱。在索沙菲被捕的前两三天，王国政府的警察在苏恩还逮捕了人民派的宣传员彬，因为彬向人民揭露了美柬军事“援助”协定所引起的恶劣后果。
    “民族报”在八月十一日报道说，据得到的确实消息，柴桢省省长已经下令逮捕了人民派柴桢地区的候选人秋嫩。逮捕令没有说明逮捕的理由。
    “民族报”指出，柬埔寨王国政府的上述行为是违背宪法的。它建议王国政府采取正确的措施来保证宪法的实现和竞选活动的进行。
    “民族报”还建议柬埔寨国际委员会监督普选，使普选能符合日内瓦协定的规定。
