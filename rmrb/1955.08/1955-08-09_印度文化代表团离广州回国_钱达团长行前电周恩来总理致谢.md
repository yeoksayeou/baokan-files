Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 8th. The Indian Cultural Delegation, headed by Chanda, has concluded its visit and performances in China and left Guangzhou this morning via Hong Kong to return home.

    Today, a huge banner with the words "Long Live Sino-Indian Friendship!" written in both Chinese and Indian languages was hung at the Guangzhou Railway Station. More than a thousand well-wishers came to see them off in the dawn. Standing at the front of the farewell crowd were Zhu Guang, the Mayor of Guangzhou; Cao Ruoming, Director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee; Xiao Junying, Director of the Cultural Bureau; Ding Bo, Director of the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Culture; Wang Yanshi, a representative of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangzhou, and others. Xia Yan, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, also came to the station to see them off. Zhou Weizhi, Deputy Director of the Arts Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, accompanied the delegation to the border.

    At the station, Chanda, his wife, and all members of the Indian Cultural Delegation accepted flowers from children and literary and artistic workers of Guangzhou.

    The guests repeatedly shook hands warmly with the well-wishers to say goodbye, and many people said "Goodbye" in Chinese and Indian.

    As the train started, people waved bouquets and waved their hands repeatedly. The sounds of applause, cheers, and the song "People of the World are of One Heart" rang out as one, until the guests were far away.

    The Indian Cultural Delegation visited China for two months. It visited and performed in fifteen cities including Beijing, Lushun-Dalian, Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Urumqi, Kashgar, Chongqing, Wuhan, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Guangzhou; giving a total of twenty-two formal performances, with an audience of more than 79,000 people. Every performance and every program received a warm welcome and praise from the audience. The delegation visited factories, rural areas, and schools in various places, toured many scenic spots and historical sites, and had extensive contact with people from all walks of life, especially engaging in various professional activities with Chinese artists, and learning and exchanging experiences with each other.

    Xinhua News Agency, August 8th. On leaving China, Chanda, head of the Indian Cultural Delegation, sent a telegram to Premier Zhou Enlai, expressing his gratitude for the reception the Indian Cultural Delegation had received in China. The telegram reads as follows:

To His Excellency Premier Zhou Enlai, Beijing:

We take back pleasant memories of our travels and stay in China, which will forever remain fresh and fragrant in our grateful hearts.
