Xinhua News Agency, August 10th—The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce recently convened an extraordinary meeting of its Standing Committee, and passed a resolution on supporting and implementing the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy in China.

After analyzing the important significance of the first Five-Year Plan, the resolution called on private industrialists and merchants across the country to strive with firm confidence and determination to complete this plan.

The resolution stated: In order to contribute to the Five-Year Plan, private industrialists and merchants should make active efforts in the following aspects:

First, adopt a positive and proactive attitude to accept the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce by the state. Those industries and businesses that have already been incorporated into the orbit of state capitalism should abide by state plans, obey the leadership of the state-owned economy, further improve production technology, improve business management, and develop towards advanced state capitalism; private parties who have already changed to joint state-private enterprises should fulfill their duties under the leadership of public representatives, actively contribute their talents, and actively transform themselves in the enterprise transformation; industries and businesses that have not yet embarked on the road of state capitalism should strive to improve production and operation, obey state policies, obey unified arrangements, and actively prepare conditions to accept socialist transformation. Those who do not want to transform, wait for transformation, or are impatient are all wrong and must be criticized and corrected.

Second, the national industrial and commercial circles must raise their patriotic thinking, strengthen their conscious awareness of abiding by the law, and resolutely struggle against all illegal activities. After the first Five-Year Plan was adopted by the National People's Congress, it has the force of law. Therefore, strictly abiding by national laws and plans, strictly obeying the management of state administrative organs and the leadership of the state-owned economy, and actively accepting the supervision of the working masses are the most important responsibilities of our industrial and commercial circles. It must be recognized that, during the transitional period, the state, on the one hand, protects the ownership of the means of production and other capital ownership of the industrial and commercial circles in accordance with the law, and allows law-abiding industrialists and merchants to obtain profits stipulated by laws and regulations within a certain period; but at the same time, the state will inevitably give due punishment to those illegal industrialists and merchants who engage in speculation and profiteering, repeatedly commit the "five evils," resist state leadership, resist socialist transformation, undermine the unity of the working class, and damage enterprises. In the future, industrial and commercial circles must help each other, supervise each other, and truly achieve patriotism and law-abidingness, and eliminate all illegal acts.

Third, practice thrift and oppose waste. At present, the phenomenon of waste in private industry and commerce is quite serious. Some industrialists and merchants underestimate the importance of thrift and ignore the harm of waste; some think that increasing production and practicing thrift is the business of employees, and they do not take an active and responsible attitude; these are all wrong and should be corrected.

Fourth, we must raise vigilance and assist the government in eliminating all overt and covert counter-revolutionaries. It must be recognized that the industrial and commercial circles are the weakest link in the enemy's conspiracy offensive. The industrial and commercial circles must raise their vigilance a hundredfold, resolutely draw a clear line with the enemy; must be firm in their confidence, actively accept socialist transformation, and not be provoked or exploited by the enemy; must strive to assist the government in exposing all overt and covert counter-revolutionaries and removing them from the industrial and commercial circles.

The resolution finally requested that private industrialists and merchants strive to study socialist management ideas in the specific practice of enterprise transformation; and earnestly study the various reports, speeches and resolutions of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress.

    全国工商联召开常务委员会临时会议
    作出关于拥护和贯彻五年计划的决议
    新华社十日讯　中华全国工商业联合会最近召开的常务委员会临时会议，作出了关于拥护和贯彻中国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的决议。
    决议在分析了第一个五年计划的重要意义后，号召全国私营工商业者以坚定的信心和决心，为完成这个计划而努力奋斗。
    决议说：为了在五年计划中作出贡献，私营工商业者应该在如下各方面作积极的努力：
    一、采取积极努力的态度，接受国家对私营工商业的社会主义改造。凡是已纳入国家资本主义轨道的工商业，应该遵守国家计划，服从国营经济领导，进一步改进生产技术，改善经营管理，向高级的国家资本主义发展；已经改变为公私合营企业的私方，应该在公方代表的领导下，尽职尽责，积极贡献自己的才能，在企业改造中积极改造自己；尚未走上国家资本主义道路的工商业，应该努力改善生产经营，服从国家政策，服从统一安排，积极准备条件来接受社会主义改造。那些不想改造，等待改造，或者急躁不安的态度都是错误的，必须批评纠正。
    二、全国工商界必须提高爱国主义思想，加强自觉的守法观念，对一切违法行为作坚决的斗争。第一个五年计划在全国人民代表大会通过以后，已发生法律的效力。因此，严格遵守国家的法律和计划，严格服从国家行政机关的管理和国营经济的领导，积极接受工人群众的监督，是我们工商界头等重大的责任。必须认识：国家在过渡时期，一方面依照法律保护工商界的生产资料所有权和其他资本所有权，并让守法的工商业者在一定时期内得到法令所规定的利润；但同时国家对那些投机倒把、重犯“五毒”、抗拒国家领导、抗拒社会主义改造、破坏工人阶级团结、破坏企业的不法工商业者，必然给以应得的处分。今后工商界必须互相帮助，互相督促，真正做到爱国守法，消灭一切违法行为。
    三、厉行节约，反对浪费。目前私营工商业的浪费现象是相当严重的。有些工商业者轻视节约的重要性，忽视浪费的危害性；有的以为增产节约是职工的事，自己不采取积极负责的态度；这些都是错误的，应该纠正。
    四、必须提高警惕，协助政府肃清一切公开的和暗藏的反革命分子。必须认识，在敌人的阴谋进攻中，工商界是一个最薄弱的环节。工商界必须百倍地提高警惕，坚决和敌人分清界限；必须坚定信心，积极接受社会主义改造，不受敌人挑拨利用；必须努力协助政府把一切公开的和暗藏的反革命分子揭发出来，从工商界中清除出去。
    决议最后要求：私营工商业者在企业改造的具体实践中，努力学习社会主义的经营管理思想；认真学习第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议的各项报告、发言和决议。
