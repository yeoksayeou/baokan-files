    County Magistrate Who Shared Weal and Woe with the People

    To the Editor:
    On June 21st, it rained incessantly in the Xin'an River area of Zhejiang Province. The floodwaters overflowed the riverbanks and poured into the city of Jiande County. Because the water rose rapidly, many people did not have time to evacuate to safe locations. In this critical situation, the local Communist Party organizations, government workers, and troops stationed there, with selfless dedication, worked day and night to rescue the victims. Zhang Qingge, the Deputy County Magistrate of Jiande County and a Communist Party member, along with the staff he led, rescued over a hundred people.

    On the night of June 20th, Comrade Zhang Qingge was busy understanding the water situation, dispatching boats to various locations, and directing flood control and rescue operations. The next morning, as the water rose higher, he led several staff members on a small boat to continue directing rescue efforts in various locations, repeatedly going to those houses about to be submerged to rescue people who had not yet escaped.

    At 2:00 PM, Comrade Zhang Qingge arrived near the Wangjia Warehouse by boat when he suddenly heard cries for help from afar. He immediately ordered the boatman to row in that direction. By this time, the houses ahead were already tilting, and the sounds of houses collapsing echoed nearby. The boatman said, "County Magistrate Zhang, the wall ahead is about to collapse. The boat can't go any further." Comrade Zhang Qingge knew that it was dangerous to proceed, but thinking of the many victims waiting for rescue and the Communist Party member's responsibility for the people's lives, he unhesitatingly stepped to the bow of the boat and told the boatman, "I'll stand at the bow, you steer from behind. We must rescue the people." The boatman, moved by his selfless spirit of saving lives, mustered his courage and pushed hard with the pole. When electric wires blocked the boat, they cut them with a knife; when walls blocked the boat, they pushed them down with force. They overcame many difficulties and finally rescued all the people.

    Around 5:00 PM, Comrade Zhang Qingge arrived on the street by boat, and at this time, cries for help came from the upper floors of two nearby houses. More than thirty people were crowded there, and the water had already risen to the upper floors, creating a very urgent situation. When these people saw the rescue boat, they hurriedly climbed onto the rooftops. However, because of some low houses in between, the boat could not get close to the two buildings, and the people could not get onto the boat. Comrade Zhang Qingge immediately ordered the boatman to use a long plank to lean against the house, led several staff members to climb onto the rooftops, personally helped the elderly down one by one, and carried the children down one by one, sending them to the boat.

    For a whole day and night, Comrade Zhang Qingge remained busy rescuing people's lives and property in soaking wet clothes; he did not rest for a minute, nor did he eat a single bite. His spirit of sharing weal and woe with the people deeply moved the broad masses. Chen Hongshu, a carver who was rescued by Comrade Zhang Qingge, said, "I am sixty-six years old this year. From the Qing Dynasty to now, I don't know how many county magistrates I have seen. But a county magistrate who risks his own life to save people like this only exists under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government."

    同人民共患难的县长编辑同志：
    六月二十一日，浙江省新安江沿岸一带大雨下个不停，洪水漫出河床，涌进了建德县城。由于水涨得很快，许多人都来不及转移到安全的地方去。在这种危急的情况下，当地的共产党组织和人民政府的机关工作人员以及驻在当地的部队，都以忘我的牺牲精神，夜以继日地抢救受难的人。建德县副县长、共产党员张庆阁同志和他率领的几个工作人员，就救出了一百多人。
    六月二十日整个晚上，张庆阁同志都在了解水情，向各处调度船只，指挥抗洪抢险工作。第二天上午水涨大了，他就率领了几个工作人员，乘着一只小船，继续到各处去指挥抢险，同时，一趟又一趟地到那些快要淹没的房子去抢救没有脱险的人。
    下午两点钟，张庆阁同志乘船到了王家仓库附近，忽然听到远远传来喊“救命”的声音。他马上叫船工向那个方向划去。这时前面的房子已倾斜了，附近响起了一阵阵房子倒塌的声音。船工说：“张县长，前面的墙就要倒塌了，船过去不得。”张庆阁同志也知道船撑过去是很危险的，可是他想到那里许多受难的人等待着救援，想到共产党员应该对人民生命负责，就毫不犹豫地走上船头去，对船工说：“我站在船头上，你在后面撑船，一定要把人救出来。”船工被他的这种忘我救人的精神所感动了，鼓起勇气，拿起篙子使劲地撑去。电线拦住了船，他们就用刀把它砍断；墙壁挡住了船，他们就用力把墙推倒。他们克服了许多困难，终于把人全部救了出来。
    到下午五点多钟，张庆阁同志乘船来到了大街上，这时附近两所房子的楼上又传来了呼救的声音。那里挤着三十多个人，而水已经涨到了楼上，情况十分紧急。当这些人看到了救命的小船后，急忙爬到屋脊上去。可是，因为当中隔着一些矮房子，船不能靠近这两所楼房，人上不了船。张庆阁同志立刻叫船工用一块长木板靠着房子，率领着几个工作人员爬上屋脊去，亲自把老人家一个个扶下来，把小孩一个个抱下来，送到船上。
    整整一天一夜，张庆阁同志一直穿着湿透了的衣服忙着抢救人民的生命和财产；没有休息过一分钟，也没有吃过一点东西。他这种同人民同生死共患难的精神使广大人民群众深深受到感动。被张庆阁同志抢救出来的刻字工人陈洪书说：“我今年六十六岁了，从清朝到现在，不知见过了多少县长。但是，像这样拼着自己的性命去救人的县长，只有在共产党和人民政府领导下才会有。”
