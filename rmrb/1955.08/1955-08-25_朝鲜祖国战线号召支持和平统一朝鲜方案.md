　　Premier Kim Il-sung proposed a plan for the peaceful reunification of Korea in a report made on August 14th at a celebration of the tenth anniversary of the "August 15th" liberation. The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front held a meeting on the 23rd to discuss this plan and passed the aforementioned resolution. The resolution analyzed the reasons why Korea had not yet achieved unification in the ten years after liberation, and condemned the Syngman Rhee clique for opposing the unification of the fatherland, trampling on the armistice agreement, and attempting to re-ignite a new war under the direction of foreign aggressors. The resolution pointed out that Marshal Kim Il-sung's current proposal for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland is just and reasonable. It not only conforms to the national interests of all the Korean people, but also fully conforms to the interests of peace-loving people all over the world. Therefore, the Central Committee of the Fatherland United Democratic Front warmly supports and endorses Marshal Kim Il-sung's plan for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.
