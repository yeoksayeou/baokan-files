    Demobilized Soldiers on Construction Posts in the Motherland

    Transporting Oil to Where the Motherland Needs It
    Editor:
    I am a demobilized soldier, currently serving as a squad leader in the First Transportation Brigade of the Transportation Department of the Yumen Mining Bureau. Nine out of the ten people in our squad were demobilized together in 1952. Since officially accepting the task of transporting crude oil to the east in November 1953, up to the end of June this year, our squad has overfulfilled the state plan for eleven months, except for periods of停驶整训 (Halting work for rectification and training) and task changes; since changing vehicles in March 1954, we have driven safely for a total of 300,000 kilometers. I personally have overfulfilled the state plan for fifteen months and driven safely for 73,000 kilometers. Because of these achievements, our squad has won three collective awards, and I was selected as a first-class labor model of the Yumen Mining Bureau in 1954 and honorably became an alternate member of the Chinese Communist Party in April this year.
    The winters in the Northwest are very cold, and the Gobi Desert often experiences blizzards, which has brought many difficulties to our work. However, we know that the construction of the motherland requires us to transport large quantities of crude oil, and we recognize that demobilized soldiers should carry forward the glorious tradition of the revolutionary army and complete the tasks assigned by the motherland in any difficult environment. Therefore, we actively overcame all difficulties and ensured the smooth progress of the crude oil transportation work. In January 1954, when the temperature was below thirty degrees Celsius, several of our convoys went to the mine to load oil. At a place 41 kilometers away from Laojunmiao, the oil tank, water tank, and engine of a vehicle from a friendly team were all frozen. Everything that could be used to heat the vehicle had been used up. In order to prevent the engine from cracking, I took off my cotton-padded coat and the scarf around my neck, dipped them in oil, and used them to heat the vehicle. After the water and oil melted, the vehicle still could not start, and the oil in several other vehicles had also run out. It was already midnight, so I had to drive my own vehicle back to the mine to load oil. After driving a short distance from the mine, I fainted because I was exhausted from being cold and hungry and the vehicle stalled and could not be driven any further. When I opened the car door to get out, I fell out of the car and fainted because I was too weak to support myself. After the driver woke me up, my face was covered with beads of sweat, and my body was feverish. However, when I thought about the other vehicles waiting for us ahead, I immediately felt energized and immediately carried five gallons of diesel fuel with my companion to the place where the vehicle had broken down. Because the weather was too cold, the engine still did not start. The next morning, I took a ride on a gasoline truck back to the mine and immediately started a diesel truck to tow those stalled vehicles. After a day of effort, we still did not succeed. It wasn't until noon on the third day that we dug out the oil from the oil tank and melted it, and the vehicle started. It melted and froze all the way, stopping and starting, and it wasn't until ten o'clock in the evening that we towed the stalled vehicle to the mine to load oil. The convoy returned to Jiuquan at eight or nine o'clock on the fourth morning. This round trip of more than 170 kilometers took a total of four days and three nights, and our faces were frozen beyond recognition; but we deeply felt the ease and joy after completing the task. There are many such deeds of overcoming severe cold and ensuring continuous transportation on our hundreds of kilometers of crude oil transportation lines.
    We not only complete our tasks, but also pay attention to taking care of our vehicles and fuel at all times. Take the comrades in our squad, for example, Youth League members Zhang Guohua and Gong Changyi drive a vehicle together, and they cherish the vehicle as soldiers cherish their weapons. In winter, they often use hot water to wipe the vehicle clean, not allowing it to have a single stain. Although their hands are swollen with frostbite, the vehicle is always very beautiful. In December 1953, when the convoy was stationed at Wuwei Station, Comrade Xing Zonggui, a party member, got up in the middle of the night to check the fuel tank in order not to affect the driving of the next shift. He found that the fuel was gone, so he unscrewed the auxiliary fuel tank to pump fuel into it. When the fuel tank was full, the screw opening of the auxiliary fuel tank was covered with a layer of ice, and it could not be screwed on, so the fuel was overflowing. Comrade Xing Zhonggui immediately pressed his hand on the opening of the auxiliary fuel tank and persisted for more than twenty minutes. When others noticed and ran to help, his hand had been frozen onto the opening of the fuel tank, and it was so swollen that the skin was torn off when it was pulled off. We asked him to rest the next day, but in order to complete the task, he continued to work.
    The people have given us honor, and we must work even better in the future to transport the crude oil from the first petroleum base to various places, meet the needs of the country, and strive to complete the country's first five-year plan.

    I Have Learned to Do Commercial Work
    Editor:
    After reading the State Council's "Decision on the Placement of Demobilized Construction Soldiers," and thinking about my own personal experience, I deeply feel that the Party and the state's care for us is truly meticulous!
    I am a second-class A-level revolutionary disabled soldier, twenty-five years old this year, and have lived in the army for more than ten years. When I was ordered to transfer to local work in September 1954, I was very reluctant to leave the army; but for the overall interests of the revolution, I obeyed the organization's decision. After arriving in Jiaxing area, Zhejiang Province, I was assigned to work in the Secretariat Section of the Jiaxing Branch of the China Monopoly Company. I only studied in elementary school for two and a half years, and I felt that I could not do secretarial work. However, when I thought of the leaders and comrades-in-arms encouraging us before leaving the army to obey the organization's assignments, work with peace of mind, maintain and carry forward the glorious tradition of the revolutionary army, and pave a broad path for later demobilized and transferred comrades, I decided to do my best. In just a few days of work, difficulties came one after another. Taking the daily work of approving documents and reviewing drafts as an example, I didn't even understand what a commodity circulation plan was, so how could I review drafts for others? And then there's cutting stencils; once, when cutting a business bulletin, because I couldn't recognize the cursive script, I asked twenty or thirty times in a row, and as a result, there were still nearly twenty misspelled or missing words, and the comrades who read the bulletin were not satisfied. Some people even discussed behind my back, saying: With such a low level of education and only one hand, how can he do secretarial work?
    In this situation, I felt very uneasy and felt that the organization's allocation of work did not consider the actual situation. Through the patient education and help of the Party branch secretary and the personnel section chief of the company, my erroneous thinking was overcome in a timely manner. Soon, the company organized cadres to go to the countryside to engage in sales promotion. In order to help me become familiar with commercial business, I was assigned to be responsible for a group to work in six places, including Huzhou City and Wuxing County. In nearly three months of practical work, thanks to the help of the company leaders and comrades, coupled with my own efforts, I initially became familiar with basic business knowledge and realized the importance of commercial work, so I deeply fell in love with my work.
    Recently, in order to further train me through practical work, the company leaders transferred me to the Chongde County Monopoly Sub-office to take on the work of director. As a new recruit on the commercial front, this job is still very difficult for me, but I have the courage to overcome all difficulties. Because Chairman Mao has long taught us: "We must overcome difficulties, we must learn what we do not understand. We must learn economic work from all experts (no matter who they are). Take them as teachers, learn respectfully, and learn honestly. If you don't understand, you don't understand, don't pretend to understand..."
    I know that tens of thousands of comrades who have been demobilized and transferred to various work posts are working hard to study, overcome difficulties, and become familiar with their business. However, there are also a small number of comrades who still have erroneous ideas such as being afraid of difficulties, making trouble about their position, and demanding better treatment, and cannot work with peace of mind in the work assigned by the Party and the state. I hope they can overcome individualistic thinking, maintain the glorious tradition of the revolutionary army, and continue to contribute everything to the socialist construction of the motherland!

    在祖国建设岗位上的复员军人们
    把石油运输到祖国需要的地方去编辑同志：
    我是一个复员军人，现在玉门矿务局运输处第一运输大队任分队长。我们分队十个人，有九个是一九五二年同时复员的。从一九五三年十一月正式接受原油东运任务以来，到今年六月底止，我们分队除因停驶整训和任务变化以外，已经有十一个月超额完成国家计划；从一九五四年三月换车起，共安全行驶了三十万公里。我个人有十五个月超额完成国家计划，安全行驶了七万三千公里。由于有了这些成绩，我们分队曾获得三次集体奖，我个人被选为玉门矿务局一九五四年度一级劳动模范，并在今年四月光荣地成为中国共产党候补党员。
    西北的冬天是非常寒冷的，戈壁滩上更是经常有暴风雪，这给我们的工作带来了很多困难。但是，我们知道祖国的建设需要我们把大批原油运输出去，我们认识复员军人应该发扬革命军队的光荣传统，在任何艰苦的环境都要完成祖国交给的任务。因此，我们积极克服了一切困难，保证了原油运输工作的顺利进行。一九五四年一月，气温在零下三十几度，我们几个车队上矿装油。在离老君庙四十一公里处，友队一辆车的油箱、水箱和引擎全冻结住了，能够用来烤车的东西都用完了。为了不使引擎被冻裂，我就脱下身上的棉衣，解下脖子上的围巾，沾上油烤车。水和油烤化以后，这辆车子还是无法发动，另外几辆车的油也用完了。这时已是半夜，我只得把自己的车开到矿上去装油。从矿上开车后走不多远，我因为连冻带饿，疲劳过度，恍惚了一下，车子就熄火了，不能再开。我打开车门想出来，因为身子软得支不住，摔下车来晕了过去。同车司机把我唤醒后，我满脸都是豆大的汗珠，身上直发烧。但是，我想到前面还有几辆车在等着我们，浑身来了劲，马上和我的同伴扛着五加仑柴油走到了车子抛锚的地方。因为天气太冷，引擎仍然没有发动，第二天早晨我又搭顺路的汽油车回矿，马上发动一辆柴油车去拖那些抛锚的车子。闹腾了一天，还是没有成功。直到第三天的中午，我们把油箱里的油挖出来溶化，车子才发动起来。一路上化了又冻，冻了又化，一走一停地，到晚上十点钟，才把抛锚的车子拖到矿上装上油。车队回到酒泉时已经是第四天早上八、九点钟了。这次往返一百七十余公里的路程共走了四天三夜，我们的脸都已冻得不成样子；但是我们却深深体会到了完成任务后的轻松愉快。像这样战胜严寒保证不停地运输的事迹，在我们数百公里的原油运输线上是很多的。
    我们不仅要完成任务，还随时注意爱护车辆和油料。就拿我们分队的同志来说，青年团员张国华、龚昌义两人合开一部车，他们爱护车辆如同战士爱护自己的武器，冬天常用热水把车子擦得精光透亮，不让它有一个污点，手虽冻肿了，车子却总是非常漂亮。一九五三年十二月车队停在武威站的时候，党员邢宗贵同志为了不影响下一班的行车，深夜起来查看油箱。他发现油没有了，就拧开副油箱往里输油。油箱内油满了，副油箱的螺丝口却冻上了一层冰，拧不上去，油直往外溢。邢忠贵同志马上用手按住副油箱口，坚持了二十多分钟。等别人发觉跑来帮忙时，他的手已冻住在油箱口上，肿得不行，一扯下来皮就撕掉了。第二天我们让他休息，但是他为了完成任务，仍然继续工作。
    人民给了我们荣誉，我们今后一定要更好地工作，把第一个石油基地的原油运到各地，满足国家的需要，为完成国家第一个五年计划而努力。

    我学会了做商业工作编辑同志：
    读了国务院“关于安置复员建设军人工作的决议”，再联想到自己亲身的经历，我深深地感到党和国家对我们的关怀真是无微不至！
    我是一个二等甲级的革命残废军人，今年二十五岁，在部队里已经生活了十年以上。一九五四年九月我奉命转业地方的时候，心里很不愿意离开部队；但是为了革命的整体利益，就服从了组织的决定。到了浙江省嘉兴地区后，我被分配到中国专卖公司嘉兴支公司秘书股工作。我过去只读过二年半小学，自己觉得干不了秘书工作。可是，一想到在离开部队前，首长和战友们勉励我们要服从组织分配，安心工作，保持和发扬革命军队的光荣传统，为后来复员转业的同志开辟宽阔的道路的话时，我就决心要尽力干。工作不几天，困难就接二连三地来了。就拿批文、复核文稿这样的日常工作来说吧，自己连个什么叫商品流转计划都不懂，那里还能给别人核稿呢？再说刻钢板吧，有一次刻一份业务简报，由于认不得草字，一连问了二三十次，结果还是错漏了近二十个字，看简报的同志都不满意。有人还背后议论说：文化水平这么低，又是独只手，怎么能做秘书工作。
    在这种情况下，我思想上很不安，感到组织分配工作不考虑实际情况。经公司党支部书记和人事股长耐心地教育帮助，我这种错误思想及时地被克服了。不久，公司组织干部下乡搞推销，为了帮助我熟悉商业业务，就分配我负责一个组分别到湖州市、吴兴县等六个地方去工作。在近三个月的实际工作中，由于公司领导和同志们的帮助，加上自己的努力，我初步熟悉了基本的业务知识，并且了解到商业工作的重要性，因此深深地爱上了自己的工作。
    最近，公司领导为了使我进一步从实际工作中得到锻炼，又把我调来崇德县专卖分处担负主任的工作。作为商业战线上的新兵，这个工作对我来说困难还是很大的，但是，我有勇气来克服一切困难。因为毛主席早已教导过我们：“我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。我们必须向一切内行的人们（不管什么人）学经济工作。拜他们做老师，恭恭敬敬地学，老老实实地学。不懂就是不懂，不要装懂。……”
    我知道，成千成万复员转业到各个工作岗位上的同志，都在努力学习，克服困难，熟悉业务。但是，也有少数同志，还存在着怕困难、闹地位、待遇等错误思想，不能安心做好党和国家所分配的工作。我希望他们能够克服个人主义思想，保持革命军队的光荣传统，为祖国的社会主义建设，继续贡献出一切！　黄　辉
