Correct Understanding of the Thrift Policy, Avoid New Waste

In Hunan Province, some design personnel, when reducing the cost of non-productive construction, did not consider the specific circumstances of construction preparation and progress, nor did they carefully consider the material preparation situation and whether the prepared materials could be transferred to other uses. They adopted simple and one-sided thrift methods, resulting in new waste. For example, in the construction project of the Changsha Post Office office building, after the project standards were lowered according to the central government's instructions, construction could have started quickly. However, the provincial design company, regardless of the actual situation, wanted to change the reinforced concrete prefabricated floor slabs of this project to fir wood flooring. Although fir wood flooring is cheaper, all the reinforced concrete prefabricated slabs for this project had already been made according to the dimensions. If they were not used, it would be difficult to allocate them to other construction sites, which would cause serious backlog. The design company did not consider this issue and insisted on its erroneous opinion, arguing repeatedly, which resulted in the indefinite delay of the construction period. For the Changsha No. 7 Middle School project, the doors and windows had already been made, but the design department decided on a new design style, and the made doors and windows could not be transferred to other places at all, causing even greater waste.

Some design personnel only focus on current savings, ignoring applicability and quality. The Hunan Provincial Design Company recently revised a batch of house designs, the roofs of which were only covered with plain tiles without felt. In principle, after omitting the felt, other technical measures must be taken, otherwise the houses would leak as soon as they were built; however, the design personnel did not consider this issue at all. This company also designed such a building: the building body is a mixed structure of reinforced concrete, but the ceiling of the building is made of bamboo woven flat top, plastered with rice straw and mud slurry. This material will fall off in a year or two, which is extremely inconsistent with the entire solid building, and will inevitably cause more rework waste in the future.

Some design personnel also mistakenly attempted to one-sidedly complete thrift figures by lowering the living standards of the masses and reducing the essential labor protection and welfare facilities for employees. Many clinics, reading rooms, nurseries, rest rooms for night shift workers, etc., were all listed as dispensable projects and were all canceled. Some people even believe that except for buildings necessary for work, everything else is "waste."

These erroneous practices are completely contrary to the state's spirit of thrift. These design personnel should correct their understanding of the thrift policy and earnestly correct this bias.

### 端正对节约方针的认识，避免新的浪费

　　端正对节约方针的认识，避免新的浪费
    湖南省有一些设计人员在降低非生产性建筑造价时，不问施工准备和施工进行的具体情况，不周密考虑备料情况和已备的料能否调作它用，采取了简单的片面的节约办法，结果造成了新的浪费。例如长沙邮局办公楼的建设工程，根据中央指示精神降低了工程标准之后，本来可以迅速开工；但是省设计公司却不顾实际情况，要将这个工程的钢筋混凝土预制地板改为杉木地板。杉木地板虽然比较便宜，但这个工程的全部钢筋混凝土预制板已经按尺寸做好，如果不使用，很难调拨给其它工地，势将造成严重的积压。设计公司不考虑这个问题，坚持自己的错误意见，一再争论，结果将施工期无限期地拖了下来。长沙市第七中学工程，门窗已经做好，设计部门却决定了新的设计式样，已做好的门窗根本无法向外调拨，造成了更大的浪费。
    有的设计人员只从目前节约着眼，忽视了适用和质量。湖南省设计公司不久前曾修改出一批房屋的设计，屋面只盖平瓦，不垫油毛毡。按道理，在省掉油毛毡之后，必须采取其它技术措施，否则房屋一盖好就会漏雨；但设计人员根本没有考虑这个问题。这个公司还设计出一座这样的大楼：楼身是钢筋混凝土的混合结构，而大楼的天花板却用竹编平顶，用稻草黄泥浆粉抹，这种材料用不了一两年就会脱落，同整个坚固的建筑物极不相称，以后必然要造成更多的返工浪费。
    还有些设计人员错误地以降低群众生活水平、削减职工必不可少的劳动保护和生活福利设施的方法，来片面地完成节约数字。许多医疗所、阅览室、托儿室、夜班工人休息室等，统通被列为可要可不要的项目，一律取消了。有人甚至认为除工作必需的建筑外，其它都是“浪费”。
    这些错误的做法，同国家的节约精神完全是背道而驰的。这些设计人员应该端正对于节约方针的认识，认真纠正这种偏向。
