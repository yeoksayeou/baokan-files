Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 10th August. The Polish news agency reported on the 9th that the Polish newspaper "People's Tribune" published a commentary on the recent provocative statements by the South Korean Syngman Rhee clique. The Syngman Rhee clique recently clamoured for the "recovery" of areas south of the 38th parallel controlled by the Korean-Chinese side according to the Korean Armistice Agreement.

The commentary also drew attention to a note presented by the Syngman Rhee clique, which demanded, in the form of an ultimatum, the withdrawal of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission inspection teams from South Korea.

The commentary pointed out that all these events once again demonstrate that the Syngman Rhee clique's policy is one of international provocation. The recent conspiracy by the Syngman Rhee clique is an attempt to shield South Korea "from the influence of the Geneva spirit."

The commentary stated that the actions taken by the Syngman Rhee clique after the Geneva Conference suggest that the situation in South Korea remains a serious threat to peace in Korea and the Far East. The countries responsible for maintaining security in this region should take steps to stop Syngman Rhee's provocations, ensure the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and make a new effort to achieve a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Korea. This is necessary if the easing of international tensions currently visible in the Far East is to be maintained.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th August. Stockholm dispatch: Swedish newspapers are paying close attention to the recent atrocities against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in South Korea. Most newspapers on the 9th carried the news with full-page headlines and published editorials commenting on the matter.

The "Morning News," the organ of the ruling Social Democratic Party, pointed out that "more serious than the threats against representatives of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is the threat that South Korea's effort to end the commission's activities by violence could reignite armed conflict in Korea."

The newspaper stated that "the demonstrations by South Korea are not aimed at the assurances of the Swedish and Swiss representatives, which makes no difference to the whole matter."

Xinhua News Agency, 10th August. London dispatch: The London evening newspaper "The Star" demanded on the 9th that Syngman Rhee's adventurous attacks on the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission be stopped. It said that Syngman Rhee cannot be allowed "to continue taking a course of action that could not only overturn the effective work of the past few weeks, but could also restart the Korean War."

The newspaper, after pointing out that "great efforts are already being made to ease tensions in various parts of the world," said: "At this delicate moment, Syngman Rhee has emerged to disrupt the entire situation by throwing his insignificant firecracker into the midst of it all. Some way must be found to deal with this stubborn old man."

"The Star" believes that "now is the time for Western countries to take decisive action to prevent Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek from taking irresponsible actions that could reignite the flames of war."

    波兰、瑞典和英国报纸发表评论
    要求制止李承晚攻击中立国委员会的暴行
    新华社华沙十日电　据波兰通讯社九日报道，波兰“人民论坛报”就南朝鲜李承晚集团最近的挑衅性言论发表评论。李承晚集团最近叫嚣要“收复”三八线以南根据朝鲜停战协定由朝中方面控制的地区。
    评论还提请大家注意李承晚集团所提出的一个照会，这个照会以最后通牒的形式要求中立国监察委员会视察小组从南朝鲜撤退。
    评论指出，所有这些事件再一次说明李承晚集团的政策是一种国际挑衅政策。李承晚集团最近的阴谋是一种想使南朝鲜“免受日内瓦精神”的影响的企图。
    评论说，李承晚集团在日内瓦会议以后所采取的行动，使人想到南朝鲜局势仍然是对朝鲜和远东和平的严重威胁。负责维护这个地区的安全的国家应当采取步骤来制止李承晚的挑衅，它们应当保证朝鲜停战条款的执行，同时它们应当作出一种新的努力来实现一个统一、爱好和平和民主的朝鲜。如果要保持现在在远东已经可以看到的国际局势的缓和，这样做是必要的。
    新华社十日讯　斯德哥尔摩消息：瑞典报纸十分注意最近在南朝鲜发生的攻击中立国监察委员会的暴行。大多数的报纸在九日都以横贯全页的头号大标题登载了这个消息，并且发表社论评论这件事。
    执政的社会民主党的机关报“晨报”指出，“比对中立国监察委员会代表的威胁还要严重的是，南朝鲜打算以暴力来结束委员会的活动的努力可能重新引起朝鲜发生武装冲突的威胁。”
    这家报纸说，“南朝鲜提出的示威目的不是针对瑞典和瑞士代表的保证，对整个问题来说是没有什么区别的。”
    新华社十日讯　伦敦消息：伦敦晚报“明星报”九日要求制止李承晚攻击朝鲜中立国监察委员会的冒险行为。它说，不能允许李承晚“继续采取一种不但可能推翻过去几星期的有效工作，而且可能重新开始朝鲜战争的行动路线”。
    这家报纸在指出“已经在作巨大的努力来缓和世界各个部分的紧张局势”以后说：“在现在这个微妙关头却出来了一个要把他的微不足道的小爆竹丢到整个大局中来捣乱的李承晚。必须想出某种对付这个顽固的老头子的办法。”
    “明星报”认为“现在正是西方国家采取决定性的行动来防止李承晚和蒋介石采取可能重新引起战火的不负责任的行动的时候了。”
