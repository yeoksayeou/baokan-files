More than 78,000 students graduating from secondary vocational schools across the country this summer are successively taking up positions in national construction. Among them, more than 37,000 are engineering graduates.

The majority of this year's graduates will be assigned to key production units of the 156 projects that the Soviet Union is helping China design. A portion of the students will work in regions such as Xinjiang, Tibet, and Qinghai. In addition to assigning all graduates of the Yellow River Water Conservancy School to the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission to participate in eliminating the scourge of the Yellow River and developing Yellow River water conservancy projects, the Ministry of Water Conservancy will also transfer a portion of graduates from other water conservancy schools to participate in soil and water conservation work in the three provinces of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu.
