Xinhua News Agency, 6th: In the twenty days since the opening of the Beijing Grain Conservation Exhibition, nearly 100,000 people have visited.

Many visitors have received profound education here, considering it a vivid lesson in grain conservation. Wang Jinglian, a staff member of the Beijing branch of the China Salt Industry Company, wrote in the comments book: "In the past, I thought wasting a little grain was nothing, and I often dropped half a steamed bun or a mouthful of rice while eating. Now I know that this directly harms the country's construction. If everyone saves one tael of grain a day, the grain saved nationwide in a year can be exchanged for the complete set of machinery and equipment for one hundred and ten seamless steel pipe factories. I guarantee that in the future, I will not only stop wasting any grain, but also do a good job in promoting grain conservation to everyone."

Some organizations collectively visited the exhibition and, combined with the phenomenon of grain waste in their own units, organized discussions to study methods for saving grain in the future. The diet administrators and cooks of the Beijing Road Engineering Company jointly proposed more than 100 grain conservation methods, some of which have already been implemented.

Many workers and shop assistants in grain departments said after visiting the exhibition that they would work hard to do their jobs well.

    北京市节约粮食展览会观众近十万人
    据新华社六日讯　北京市节约粮食展览会开幕以来的二十天中，观众已近十万人。
    很多观众在这里受到了深刻的教育，认为是上了一堂生动的节约粮食课。中国盐业公司北京市公司工作人员王景联在意见簿上写道：“过去认为浪费点粮食不算啥，吃饭时常常掉下半块馒头或一口饭，现在才知道这直接危害着国家建设，只要一人一天节省一两粮食，一年全国节省的粮食就能换取一百一十座无缝钢管厂的全套机器设备。我保证今后不但不再抛撒一点粮食，还要向大家做好节约粮食的宣传工作。”
    有些机关团体集体参观后，还结合本单位浪费粮食现象，组织讨论，研究今后节约粮食办法。北京市道路工程公司的伙食管理员和炊事员共提出了一百多条节约粮食办法，有些并已开始实行。
    很多粮食部门的工人、店员从展览会参观回来后，表示要努力做好自己的工作。
