Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd -- More than five thousand people from all walks of life in the capital held a meeting this afternoon to support the Indian people in recovering Goa. Workers, suburban farmers, government cadres, scientific workers, teachers, medical workers, Muslims, and Buddhists unanimously passed a resolution supporting the Indian people's struggle to recover Goa. The meeting paid high tribute to the Indian people who are bravely fighting to defend their national territorial sovereignty, expressed deep condolences and sympathy to the victimized Indian patriots and their families, and protested with great indignation against the atrocities of the Portuguese colonialists.
	Today's meeting began at 6 p.m. Seated on the rostrum were Ding Xilin, President of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association; Chen Hansheng, Vice President; Liao Chengzhi, Lai Ruoyu, Li Dequan, Wu Han, Mao Dun, Zhang Xiruo, Yang Hansheng, heads of Chinese people's organizations; Dong Wu Kameda and Wan Tu Lele, Deputy Secretaries-General of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee; and R.K. Nehru, Indian Ambassador to China.
	The meeting was presided over by Chen Hansheng, Vice President of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association.
	Ding Xilin, President of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, spoke first at the meeting. On behalf of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, he paid high tribute and expressed heartfelt support to the Indian people who are waging a heroic struggle against colonialism to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity. He expressed great indignation and protest against the atrocities of the Portuguese colonialists in massacring peaceful Indian people, and at the same time deeply mourned the victimized Indian patriots and expressed deep condolences to their families. Ding Xilin said: Today, people from all walks of life in the capital are holding a meeting here to support the Indian people's just struggle to recover Goa. This is a powerful manifestation of the deep friendship between the people of China and India.
	Ding Xilin pointed out: Goa is an inseparable part of India. Since ancient times, as in Mumbai, Indian people have lived in Goa, developing their economic and cultural lives and exercising their sacred sovereignty. Only in the sixteenth century, when Western colonialists began to invade India, this ancient cultural nation, did Goa fall into the hands of Portuguese armed occupiers and become a colonial base in the East. The Indian people, in order to restore national independence and freedom, have waged a long and unyielding struggle against foreign rulers, and have won significant victories since World War II. However, in this situation, the Portuguese colonialists have remained stubbornly opposed, and still want to retain their occupied territories of Goa, Daman and Diu in India, and continue to rule the Indian people there with violence.
	Ding Xilin said: The Indian people's struggle to recover Goa is just and has won the sympathy and support of the people of Asia and the world. But what is shocking is that on August 15th - Indian Independence Day, when Indian volunteers entered Goa, the Portuguese authorities carried out a brutal massacre of these peaceful patriots. In recent days, the Portuguese colonialists, disregarding the angry protests of the Indian people, the Indian government, and the people of all countries in the world, are still wantonly arresting and beating Indian volunteers who continue to enter Goa, and are carrying out brutal suppression within Goa.
	Ding Xilin continued: This atrocity by the Portuguese authorities occurred in the second half of the twentieth century, less than four months after the closing of the Asian-African Conference. The final communique of the Asian-African Conference clearly stipulated the principle of "respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries." This is one of the basic principles for peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation among the twenty-nine Asian and African countries, and also reflects the firm will of the 1.4 billion people of Asia and Africa to safeguard their national sovereignty and territorial integrity. With this solemn declaration by the Asian and African countries and peoples, the days when colonialists ran rampant in the East should have come to an end, but the Portuguese colonialists ignored the progress of history and the power of the people, and frantically massacred Indian patriots who peacefully defended their motherland's territory and sovereignty. This atrocity by the Portuguese colonialists not only violates all humanitarian principles and international standards of conduct, but we believe it is also a blatant provocation against the Asian people and an attack by colonialist forces on the Eastern national independence movement. Therefore, the occurrence of this incident has aroused great anger and condemnation from the entire Indian people, the Asian people, and the peace-loving people of the world, which is only natural.
	Ding Xilin emphasized that the Chinese and Indian people have long supported and encouraged each other in the struggle for national independence in modern times, and have formed a deep friendship through thick and thin. Ding Xilin said: We deeply sympathize with and support the Indian people's patriotic movement to recover Goa. We cannot allow the colonialists to run amok in Asia again. We want to express our strong protest to the Portuguese authorities who massacred the Indian people.
	Ding Xilin finally expressed his firm belief that the Indian people's just struggle will surely be victorious, that the sympathy and support of the Chinese people, the Asian people, and the people of the world will always belong to the Indian people, and he also shouted: "Down with colonialism! Long live Asian peace! Long live world peace!"
	Liao Chengzhi, Vice Chairman of the China Peace Committee, Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Wu Han, Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, and Mao Dun, Vice Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, successively spoke at the meeting, expressing support on behalf of the 600 million Chinese people for the Indian people's just struggle to recover Goa.
	Liao Chengzhi said that the Indian people this time, on August 15th, in order to support the liberation struggle of the Goan people, sent volunteers to peacefully enter Goa. This is a great patriotic action by the Indian people to demand the return of Goa to their motherland, and this is completely in line with the spirit of the Asian-African Conference. The Portuguese colonialists should have left Goa long ago. However, the Portuguese colonialists used force to carry out bloody suppression of the Indian people, killing and wounding more than two hundred unarmed Indian citizens, which further exposed the true face of the colonialists who have always used violent means. Their atrocities can only arouse unanimous condemnation from peace-loving people all over the world. We peace-loving Chinese people have always supported the struggles of all countries aimed at safeguarding peace and ensuring national territorial sovereignty. We 600 million Chinese people fully support the Indian people's just struggle to demand the return of Goa to India.
	Lai Ruoyu said that Goa is an inseparable part of Indian territory, just as Taiwan is Chinese territory. The era when colonialists ran rampant in Asia is over. Today, opposing colonialism, demanding national independence, and resolutely safeguarding one's national sovereignty and territorial integrity have become the unshakable common will of the awakened people of Asian countries. The Chinese working class, which has suffered deeply from the rule and oppression of colonialists, can fully understand the Indian people's firm will to oppose colonialists. The Chinese working class, together with the entire Chinese people, expresses full sympathy and support for this just struggle of the Indian people. Lai Ruoyu called on the working classes of Asian countries to take active action to support the Indian people's just struggle to demand the return of Goa to India.
	Li Dequan said that the Chinese people have had long-term personal experience of the cruel plunder and oppression of colonialists in the past. At present, the Chinese people are waging a resolute struggle to liberate Taiwan. Therefore, Chinese women and the Chinese people fully sympathize with and support the Indian people's just struggle to demand the recovery of their territory, Goa, and believe that this struggle will surely receive the support of the people of Asia and the world who love peace, independence, and freedom. This struggle will surely achieve final victory.
	Wu Han said that the Indian people cannot tolerate the continued presence of foreign colonies on Indian territory, and the people of Goa especially cannot tolerate the rule of foreign colonialists. They demand that Goa be returned to India. This is the struggle of the Indian people and the people of Goa to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to safeguard their national rights. This struggle is just. The Chinese youth and the Chinese people fully sympathize with and support this just struggle of the heroic Indian people. Wu Han pointed out that today, the Asian people have awakened and united. Any colonialist who attempts to run amok in Asia in the second half of the twentieth century will surely be met with a bloody nose.
	Mao Dun said that the Asian countries conference had made a clear resolution on the Goa issue, confirming that Goa, Daman and Diu are inseparable parts of India. It is surprising that even today, the Portuguese colonialists still want to preserve their occupied territories on Indian territory, which is of course absolutely intolerable to the Indian people. He expressed on behalf of our country's literary and art workers his great anger and protest against the atrocities of the Portuguese colonialists, and expressed sympathy and support for the just struggle of the Indian people for the liberation of Goa. Mao Dun said: Justice belongs to the Indian people, and victory will surely belong to the heroic and patriotic Indian people.
	Wan Tu Lele, Deputy Secretary-General of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee, also spoke at the meeting. He said that the Portuguese colonialists carried out a large-scale massacre of Indian civilians simply because the Indian people raised their own national flag on their own land. This crime proves that the Portuguese colonialists not only refuse peaceful solutions, but also violate the most basic humanitarian principles.
	Wan Tu Lele said that I, on behalf of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee, assure the Indian people that in this moment of sorrow and struggle, the Indian people will receive our sympathy and support.
	R.K. Nehru, the Indian Ambassador to China, spoke last at the meeting. He thanked the Chinese people for their sympathy, support, and friendship towards the Indian people's struggle to recover Goa. When he stood up to speak, prolonged applause erupted in the hall. R.K. Nehru said, I know that this meeting and the feelings you have expressed will be echoed throughout China. When the Portuguese colonialists hear it, they will know that the awakened people of Asia are completely united on the issue of colonialism.
	R.K. Nehru said that in this twentieth century, some countries, disregarding justice, disregarding shame, and even using cruel means to maintain the gains of colonialism in other countries' territories, have been despised and condemned by the people of the world. If colonialism still dreams of maintaining the remnants of its medieval rule to this day, they will find themselves in a non-existent paradise of their own creation. It is certain that the foreign ruling forces in Goa will sooner or later recognize their mistakes and wasted efforts.
	R.K. Nehru finally said: Goa and the Indian people are not isolated in the struggle to recover Goa. India's voice is correct. Burma has spoken, Indonesia has spoken, China has spoken, all of Asia has spoken, and peace-loving people all over the world have spoken. Goa is a symbol, Goa will surely be recovered, and Goa will eventually win freedom.
	After the speeches, the entire audience unanimously passed the telegrams to Prime Minister Nehru of the Republic of India and to the Sino-Indian Friendship Association supporting the Indian people's just struggle to recover Goa. Thunderous applause erupted throughout the hall and lasted for a long time.

　　北京各界五千多人举行大会
　　支援印度人民收复果阿
    新华社二十三日讯　首都各界人民五千多人在二十三日下午举行支援印度人民收复果阿大会。参加大会的工人、郊区农民、机关干部、科学工作者、教师、医务工作者、伊斯兰教徒和佛教徒一致通过的决议，支援印度人民收复果阿的斗争。大会向为了保卫祖国领土主权而英勇斗争的印度人民致以崇高的敬意，向受害的印度爱国者及其家属表示深切的哀悼和慰问，并以极大的愤慨抗议葡萄牙殖民主义者的暴行。
    今天的大会在下午六时举行。在主席台上就座的有中印友好协会会长丁西林、副会长陈翰笙，中国各人民团体负责人廖承志、赖若愚、李德全、吴晗、茅盾、张奚若、阳翰笙，亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会副秘书长龟田东伍、万徒勒里，印度驻华大使赖嘉文。　　大会由中印友好协会副会长陈翰笙主持。
    中印友好协会会长丁西林在会上首先讲话，他代表中印友好协会对为了保卫自己国家的主权和领土完整而进行反对殖民主义的英勇斗争的印度人民致以崇高的敬意和表示衷心的支援，对葡萄牙殖民主义者残杀和平印度人民的暴行表示极大的愤慨和抗议，同时沉痛地悼念受害的印度爱国者们，并向他们的家属表示深切的慰问。丁西林说：今天首都各界人民在这里举行大会，支援印度人民收复果阿的正义斗争，这是中印两国人民之间的深厚友谊的有力表现。
    丁西林指出：果阿是印度的不可分割的一部分。自古以来，在果阿正如在孟买一样，是印度人民在居住着，开辟着自己的经济文化生活，执行着神圣的主权。只有到十六世纪，西方殖民主义者开始侵入印度这个古老的文化国家时，果阿才落入葡萄牙武力占领者的手中，成为殖民主义在东方的一个基地。印度人民为了恢复民族的独立自由，曾经长期地对外国统治者进行坚强不屈的斗争，并且在第二次世界大战以后赢得了重大的胜利。但是在这种情况下，葡萄牙殖民者竟执迷不悟，还想保留它在印度的占领地果阿、达曼和第乌，继续用暴力统治着那里的印度人民。
    丁西林说：印度人民收复果阿的斗争是正义的，它获得亚洲和全世界人民的同情和支援。但令人震惊的是，就在八月十五日——印度独立纪念日，当印度志愿人员进入果阿的时候，葡萄牙当局对这些和平的爱国者们进行了惨无人道的屠杀。最近几天以来，葡萄牙殖民者仍然不顾全印度人民和印度政府以及世界各国人民的愤怒抗议，还在对陆续进入果阿的印度志愿人员肆行逮捕和毒打，并在果阿境内进行残暴的镇压。
    丁西林接着说：葡萄牙当局的这一暴行是在二十世纪下半期的今天发生的，是在亚非会议闭幕以后不到四个月的时间发生的。亚非会议的最后公报中，明白规定了“尊重一切国家的主权和领土完整”的原则，这是亚非二十九个国家和平相处和友好合作的基本原则之一，同时也反映着亚非十四亿人民维护自己国家主权和领土完整的坚强意志。随着亚非国家和人民的这一庄严的宣告，殖民主义者在东方横行霸道的日子原来应该结束了，但是葡萄牙殖民者竟无视于历史的进展和人民的力量，疯狂地屠杀了以和平方式卫护祖国领土和主权的印度爱国者们。葡萄牙殖民者的这一暴行，不但违反了一切人道精神和国际行为的标准，而且我们认为是对亚洲人民的狂妄的挑衅，是殖民主义势力对东方民族独立运动的进攻。因此，这一事件的发生，业已激起了全印度人民，亚洲人民和世界爱好和平人民的极大愤怒和谴责，这是理所当然的。
    丁西林强调中国人民同印度人民在近代以来争取民族独立的斗争中，长期地相互支援和相互鼓励，结成了深厚的患难友谊。丁西林说：我们深切地同情和支援印度人民收复果阿的爱国运动。我们不能听任殖民主义者再在亚洲胡作非为。我们要对屠杀印度人民的葡萄牙当局表示强烈的抗议。
    丁西林最后表示深信印度人民的正义的斗争必将获得胜利，中国人民、亚洲人民和全世界人民的同情和支援永远属于印度人民，他并且高呼反对殖民主义、亚洲和平万岁和世界和平万岁。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席廖承志、中华全国总工会主席赖若愚、中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席李德全、中华全国民主青年联合会副主席吴晗、中国文学艺术界联合会副主席茅盾相继在会上讲话，代表六亿中国人民对印度人民收复果阿的正义斗争表示支援。
    廖承志说，这次印度人民在八月十五日为了支援果阿人民的解放斗争，派遣了志愿人员和平进入果阿，这是印度人民要求果阿重归祖国的伟大爱国行动，这是完全符合于亚非会议的精神的，葡萄牙殖民主义者老早就应该离开果阿。但是，葡萄牙殖民主义者却使用武力对印度人民施行血腥镇压，杀死和杀伤二百多名手无寸铁的印度公民，这就更加暴露出一贯使用暴力手段的殖民主义者的真面目，他们的这种暴行只能引起全世界爱好和平人民的一致谴责。我们爱好和平的中国人民，是一贯支持各国人民目的在于拥护和平、保障国家领土主权完整的斗争。我们六亿中国人民完全支持印度人民要求果阿重归印度的正义斗争。
    赖若愚说，果阿是印度领土不可分割的一部分，正像台湾是中国的领土一样。殖民主义者在亚洲横行霸道的时代已经过去了。今天，反对殖民主义、要求民族独立、坚决维护自己国家的主权和领土完整已经是觉醒了的亚洲各国人民的不可动摇的共同意志。深受过殖民主义者的统治和压迫之苦的中国工人阶级完全能够理解印度人民坚决反对殖民主义者的意志。中国工人阶级和全中国人民一道，对印度人民这一正义斗争表示完全同情和支持。赖若愚要求亚洲各国工人阶级积极行动起来，支持印度人民要求果阿重归印度的正义斗争。
    李德全说，中国人民对于殖民主义者残酷的掠夺和压迫，在过去曾经有过长期的亲身体会。目前中国人民正在为解放台湾而进行坚决的斗争。因此，中国妇女和人民完全同情和支持印度人民要求收复自己领土果阿的正义斗争，并相信这一斗争一定能得到亚洲以及全世界爱好和平、爱好独立自由人民的支援。这一斗争一定能取得最后胜利。
    吴晗说，印度人民不能容忍在印度的领土上继续保留着外国殖民地，果阿人民尤其不能忍受外来殖民主义者的统治，他们要求果阿归还印度，这是印度人民和果阿人民为了保障国家主权和领土完整、为了保障自己的民族权利的斗争，这个斗争是正义的。中国青年和中国人民完全同情和支持英勇的印度人民的这一正义的斗争。吴晗指出，今天，亚洲人民已经觉醒了，团结起来了，任何殖民主义者妄想在二十世纪下半期的今天，在亚洲横行霸道，它必将要碰得头破血流。
    茅盾说，亚洲国家会议曾经对果阿问题作出明确的决议，它确认果阿、达曼和第乌是印度的不可分割的部分。令人惊奇的是，直到今天，葡萄牙殖民者还想在印度的领土上保存着自己的占领地，这当然是印度人民绝不能容忍的。他代表我国文艺工作者对葡萄牙殖民主义者的暴行表示极大的愤怒和抗议，对于印度人民为争取果阿解放所进行的正义斗争表示同情和支持。茅盾说：正义是属于印度人民的、胜利也必将属于英勇爱国的印度人民。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会副秘书长万徒勒里也在会上讲了话。他说，葡萄牙殖民主义者仅仅是由于印度人民在本国土地上打起自己的国旗，就对印度平民进行了大规模的屠杀。这一罪行，证明了葡萄牙殖民主义者不仅拒绝和平解决方式，而且违反了最起码的人道原则。
    万徒勒里说，我代表亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会向印度人民保证：在现在这个悲痛和斗争的时刻，印度人民会得到我们的同情和支持的。
    印度驻华大使赖嘉文最后在会上讲话。他感谢中国人民对印度人民收复果阿斗争的同情、支援和友谊。当他起立讲话时，会场上响起了经久不息的掌声。赖嘉文说，我知道这个大会和你们所表示的感情，将要在全中国都得到反应。当葡萄牙殖民主义者听到时，它将知道觉醒了的亚洲人民在殖民主义这个问题上完全是一个呼声的。
    赖嘉文说，在这二十世纪里，有的国家不顾正义、不顾羞耻、甚至以残忍的手段在他国的土地上来保持殖民主义的所得，已受到了全世界人民的冷视和谴责。如果殖民主义到今天还梦想保持它那中古时代统治的残余，他们将会发现自己是处在一个自己所创造的并不存在的乐园中。可以肯定，果阿的外国统治势力早晚将要认识到他们的错误和枉费心机。
    赖嘉文最后说：果阿和印度人民在收复果阿的斗争中并不是孤立的。印度的呼声是正确的。缅甸发言了，印度尼西亚发言了，中国发言了，全亚洲发言了，全世界爱好和平人民都发言了。果阿是一个象征，果阿必将收复，果阿终于会赢得自由的。
    在讲话结束后，全场一致通过了大会致印度共和国尼赫鲁总理和致印中友好协会支持印度人民收复果阿这一正义斗争的电报。全场掌声雷鸣，经久不息。
