　　Condemning the Atrocities of French Colonialists in North Africa
    Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser
    Cairo dispatch: Cairo Radio broadcast a statement by an Egyptian government spokesman on the 26th, saying that Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser, during a meeting with the U.S. Ambassador to Egypt, Henry Byroade, on the 25th, told him that the Egyptian government believes that the use of French troops belonging to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and military forces belonging to this group to deal with North Africans is not only an act by France, but also a hostile act by all members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization against all Arab countries.
    Nasser asked Byroade to convey this attitude of Egypt to the U.S. government.
    Director of the Moroccan Information Office
    Washington dispatch: Ben-Aboud, director of the Moroccan Information Office in New York, held a press conference at the Egyptian Embassy in the United States on the 25th to denounce the atrocities of French colonialists in massacring Moroccan residents. Ben-Aboud also pointed out that the Asian and African countries, representing more than half of the world's population, are linking the French authorities' killings of North African people with the United States, because the French colonial army is using American weapons. He said:
  "The role of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in North Africa is merely to allow France to continuously send troops into the region to massacre hundreds of thousands of unarmed people with American weapons, which is a sad irony."
    Ben-Aboud said that due to the atrocities of the French colonial authorities, the population of Morocco has decreased from nine million to seven and a half million since 1948. The actions of the French colonial authorities in Morocco constitute "brutal and bloody suppression." He said that between 10,000 and 50,000 people have already been massacred in the current brutal suppression of the North African people by the French colonial army.
    Ben-Aboud said that progressive social and economic measures in Morocco are limited to the areas where French people live, and in the rest of the country, "the only thing is violence." Ben-Aboud said that he has many photos showing that the French colonial army not only kills adults, but also kills women and children. He accused the French army of conducting military exercises
  "often as a cover for massacres."
      Burmese House of Representatives
    Yangon dispatch: The House of Representatives of the Union of Burma passed a motion on the 26th condemning the suppression of movements for national independence by the French in Morocco and Algeria, and by the Portuguese in Goa.
    The ruling Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League and the opposition party in the House of Representatives unanimously supported the motion.
      Citizens of Karachi
    Karachi dispatch: More than 20,000 citizens of Karachi, the capital of Pakistan, held a demonstration on the 26th to protest against the French suppression of the people of Morocco and Algeria in North Africa.
    Fifty women led the march. The procession passed through the main streets of Karachi. They held signs reading "Oppose French atrocities!" "Boycott all French goods!"
    The procession held a demonstration in front of the French Embassy in Pakistan and burned portraits of the French rulers in Morocco and Algeria. They also sent a delegation to deliver a letter of protest to the French Embassy.
    The procession also went to the Governor-General's Office and sent a delegation to request the Pakistani government to take action to stop the French atrocities in North Africa. Acting Governor-General Mirza told the delegation that the Pakistani government was "deeply disturbed by what is happening in Morocco and Algeria."

　　谴责法国殖民主义者在北非的暴行
    埃及总理纳赛尔
    开罗消息：开罗电台二十六日广播埃及政府发言人的一篇声明说，埃及总理纳赛尔在二十五日同美国驻埃及大使亨利·拜娄德会见时曾对他说，埃及政府认为，使用属于北大西洋公约组织的法国部队和属于这个集团的军事部队来对付北非人一事，不仅是法国的，而且是北大西洋公约的所有成员国对所有阿拉伯国家的一种敌对行为。
    纳赛尔要求拜娄德把埃及这种态度转告美国政府。
    摩洛哥新闻处处长
    华盛顿消息：驻在纽约的摩洛哥新闻处处长本—阿卜德二十五日在埃及驻美国大使馆举行记者招待会，控诉法国殖民者屠杀摩洛哥居民的暴行。本—阿卜德还指出，亚非国家的占世界半数以上的人民要把法国当局对北非人民的杀戮同美国联系起来，因为法国殖民军队使用的正是美国武器。他说：
  “北大西洋公约组织在北非的作用只是容许法国把部队源源开入那个地区去，以美国的武器来屠杀成千上万手无寸铁的人民，这是一个可悲的讽刺。”
    本—阿卜德说，由于法国殖民当局的暴行，摩洛哥的人口自从一九四八年以来已经从九百万减少到七百五十万。法国殖民当局在摩洛哥的行动构成了“残暴的、血腥的镇压”。他说，在目前法国殖民军队对北非人民的残暴镇压中已经有一万到五万人被屠杀。
    本—阿卜德说，进步的社会和经济措施在摩洛哥只限于法国人居住的地方，在其余的地方，“唯一的东西就是暴力”。本—阿卜德说，他有许多照片，说明法国殖民军队不但杀害成年人，而且还杀害妇女和儿童。他指责说，法国军队进行军事演习
  “常常是屠杀的掩饰”。
      缅甸国会代表院
    仰光消息：缅甸联邦国会代表院二十六日通过动议，谴责法国在摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚，以及葡萄牙在果阿的帝国主义政权对争取民族独立的运动的镇压行为。
    代表院中的缅甸执政党反法西斯人民自由同盟和反对党一致支持这个动议。
      喀喇蚩市民
    喀喇蚩消息：巴基斯坦首都喀喇蚩市民两万多人二十六日举行示威游行，抗议法国镇压北非摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚人民的暴行。
    走在游行队伍前面的是五十个妇女。游行队伍穿过了喀喇蚩的各主要街道。他们举着“反对法国的暴行！”“抵制一切法国货！”等标语。
    游行队伍在法国驻巴基斯坦大使馆前面举行了示威集会，并且在那里焚烧了法国在摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚的统治者的肖像。他们还派代表团把抗议书交给法国大使馆。
    游行队伍还走到总督府，派遣代表团要求巴基斯坦政府采取行动，制止法国在北非的暴行。代理总督米尔扎向代表团表示，巴基斯坦政府“对于在摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚发生的事情深感不安”。
