All Labor is Necessary for the Realization of the Five-Year Plan
    Sha Ying
    The First Five-Year Plan is a decisive program led by the Chinese Communist Party for the people of the whole country to strive for the realization of the general task of the transition period. It correctly reflects the common aspiration and common will of the people of the whole country to build our great motherland. Now the people of the whole country are enthusiastically praising and supporting this plan, and are rejoicing for the beautiful prospects of our country's construction displayed by this plan.
    Can such a great Five-Year Plan be realized? We can definitely say that it is entirely possible. Because this Five-Year Plan not only meets the requirements of the Party's general line, but also conforms to the actual situation in our country. It is a scientific plan based on objective economic laws. At the same time, our country has many favorable conditions for realizing this plan. While we were compiling the plan, we were also carrying out construction, and the plan has been successfully underway for two years. But how can we turn the possibility of completing the plan into reality, how can we complete the work of the next three years and thus complete the entire First Five-Year Plan? This can only be achieved by relying on the people of all ethnic groups across the country, under the leadership of the Party and the government, to fully utilize all our favorable conditions, carry forward the fine tradition of hard work, diligently labor, strive to increase production, and practice strict economy. Stalin taught us: "It would be foolish to think that a production plan is just a table of figures and a list of tasks. In fact, a production plan is the living practical action of hundreds of millions of people. The reality of our production plan is hundreds of millions of laborers creating a new life. The reality of our production plan is living people, it is ourselves, our will to work, our determination to work in a new way, our determination to implement the plan." ("New Environment and New Tasks of Economic Construction")
    In the struggle to implement the Five-Year Plan, the working class of the whole country bears a particularly important task. Because socialist industrialization is the main body of socialist construction, carrying out basic construction and increasing industrial production are the center of the Five-Year Plan, and these must be completed by the hands of the workers. Therefore, it is said that the working class bears the main task. This is a new glorious mission entrusted to our working class by history. In the process of national economic recovery and development, the working class has already exerted great strength and made great contributions. In front of the people of the whole country, they have shown that they are indeed worthy of being the leading class of the country and the masters of state-owned enterprises. Especially after the implementation of the Five-Year Plan began, a fervent labor competition has been widely launched throughout the country. In 1954 alone, employees across the country put forward more than 848,000 rationalization proposals in the labor competition, and 435,812 labor models and advanced producers emerged, as well as 37,097 various model production units (including grassroots units, workshops, work sections, groups, and offices, etc.). For example, Wang Chonglun, a worker at the Angang Machinery General Factory, created the "universal tool tire," which is of great significance to the machinery department. It can complete four years of production tasks in one year, and can increase production by more than 45,000 yuan for the country. Due to the heroic labor of the working class, the plans for the first and second years of the Five-Year Plan have been successfully completed. Now the working class must further exert its enthusiasm and creativity, strive to improve its political consciousness, technical and cultural level, and professional level, carry out labor competitions, consolidate labor discipline, learn and promote advanced experience, and constantly improve labor productivity and reduce costs, in order to struggle for the realization of the Five-Year Plan. Therefore, all workers, staff members and employees of state-owned enterprises, cooperative enterprises, joint state-private enterprises and private enterprises should become active fighters on the labor front. Only when the working class strives to play a leading role and creates huge wealth for the country with its labor, can our country's socialist construction cause be successfully completed.
    Industry and agriculture are the two main sectors of the national economy, and developing agriculture is precisely the basic condition for guaranteeing the development of industry and the completion of the entire economic plan. Because supplying the food for the people of the whole country, supplying industrial raw materials, and purchasing industrial equipment and construction materials with the foreign exchange earned from exporting agricultural products, all depend on the agricultural production increase of the vast number of farmers. Stalin once pointed out: "Socialist society is a production and consumption combination of industrial and agricultural workers. If, in this combination, industry is not coordinated with agriculture, which supplies raw materials, food and consumes industrial products, if industry and agriculture cannot therefore form a unified whole of the national economy, then no socialist results can be obtained from this." ("Problems and Answers") Therefore, in the struggle to build socialism and realize the First Five-Year Plan, overcoming the contradiction that the development of agriculture is too far behind the development of industry is a very important task. Our 500 million farmers are shouldering this major task.
    In the past, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the farmers of our country carried out a long and arduous struggle, paid a great price, and achieved the great victory of the people's democratic revolution. After liberation, due to the great land reform movement that eliminated the feudal exploitation system, and due to the many correct policies adopted by the state for the development of agricultural production, the vast number of farmers raised their labor enthusiasm and made great contributions on the production front, enabling our country's agricultural production to rapidly exceed the pre-liberation level. Now the First Five-Year Plan stipulates that the total output value of agriculture and its sideline occupations should increase by 23.3 percent in five years. In terms of output, grain should increase by 17.6 percent and cotton should increase by 25.4 percent. This is necessary to complete the entire Five-Year Plan. Otherwise, if agricultural production cannot complete the plan, it will not only affect the food of urban and rural people, but will also cause the vast majority of light industries to reduce their development speed or fail to complete their production plans due to insufficient raw materials, and make the import plan unable to be completed due to the reduction of export goods. At the same time, reducing light industrial products means reducing the supply of people's daily necessities; reducing imports means increasing the difficulty of construction. Therefore, in order to realize the Five-Year Plan, farmers across the country should constantly improve their political awareness under the leadership of local Party committees and governments, strive to develop agricultural production cooperatives, improve agricultural production technology, build water conservancy projects, cultivate land intensively and meticulously, reclaim wasteland, prevent and overcome disasters, and actively increase production of grain, cotton, oilseeds and other cash crops according to the state plan; and abide by the state's plan, sell surplus grain, cotton and other agricultural products to the state, and strive to support the country's industrial construction. Therefore, in order to complete the agricultural production increase plan stipulated in the Five-Year Plan, not only the labor of the workers and staff of state-owned farms and the members of agricultural production cooperatives is indispensable, but also the labor of individual farmers is indispensable labor, and it is glorious labor. They are all responsible for completing the tasks stipulated for them in the Five-Year Plan.
    It must be pointed out that workers and farmers are the largest number of laborers in the country and the main creators of all material wealth. Socialist construction and the realization of the Five-Year Plan mainly rely on the labor of workers and farmers. At the same time, the worker-peasant alliance is the foundation for our people's revolution to achieve victory. Strengthening and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class is also the foundation for completing the First Five-Year Plan and striving for socialist victory. Therefore, we should cherish the worker-peasant alliance as we cherish our eyes.
    The national economy is a complex whole, and its many departments must develop harmoniously and proportionally. This is required by the law of planned development of the socialist economy. Otherwise, it will lead to chaos in economic life and seriously affect the cause of socialist construction. Our Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy is not only a plan for industry and agriculture, but also a plan for all other economic sectors. It stipulates specific tasks for all economic sectors. Therefore, all economic sectors must strive to complete the tasks stipulated for them in the Five-Year Plan. The labor of the staff of all economic sectors, including the labor of workers, staff members and employees of public and private economic sectors, is indispensable for completing the Five-Year Plan. Taking the transportation industry as an example, it is one of the main sectors of the national economy, and it is of extremely important significance for developing industrial and agricultural production and meeting the consumption needs of the people. Because transportation is an indispensable process of production. Between industry and agriculture, and between various industrial sectors, it is necessary to rely on transportation to connect them in order to carry out normal production. In many cases, the products of one department are the necessary means of production for another department. Without transportation, production will be suspended. Moreover, any product cannot reach consumers without transportation. Therefore, the transportation industry plays an important role in meeting the consumption needs of the people. We are now carrying out many basic construction projects, and a large number of machinery and equipment, building materials, and workers' living materials also need to be transported quickly. At the same time, transportation plays an important role in the political unity, cultural connection and national defense consolidation of the people of the whole country. In the future, with the growth of industrial and agricultural production, with the expansion and acceleration of commodity circulation, with the improvement of people's living standards, and for the needs of national defense, politics and culture, the transportation industry must also have corresponding development. The Five-Year Plan stipulates specific tasks for all departments of transportation. Whether it is the freight turnover of railways, waterways, or road automobile transportation, it will increase more than doubled in five years. Therefore, the work in the transportation field is very important. The labor of all personnel working in these departments is necessary for the realization of the Five-Year Plan. Any view that underestimates transportation work is wrong. Taking commerce as another example, it is also an important sector of the national economy, and it is also of great significance for the development of industrial and agricultural production and for meeting the growing needs of the people. Because it is inseparable from commercial work to connect industry and agriculture, to implement the distribution of industrial and agricultural products, and to implement the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. It can be said that commerce is the intermediate link connecting production and consumption, the basic form of distribution of personal consumer goods, and an extremely important link in the economic connection between urban and rural areas. If commerce cannot develop accordingly, it will cause chaos and disconnection in economic life. Therefore, the Five-Year Plan stipulates specific tasks for state-owned commerce, cooperative-operated commerce, etc. Personnel working in these departments should also actively complete their tasks. Their labor is also indispensable for realizing the Five-Year Plan. Those who underestimate commercial work, thinking that "commercial work is not promising," saying that "commercial work is busy and chaotic, there are opinions if the supply is not good, even if you are a manager in a store, it is better than a government correspondent" and other arguments are very wrong and should be strictly criticized. In order to complete the important tasks given by the Five-Year Plan, the staff of our state-owned commerce, supply and marketing cooperatives, and consumer cooperatives should vigorously carry out the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, improve business management, reduce commodity circulation costs, implement the state's planned supply and planned purchase policies, and conscientiously do a good job in the socialist transformation of private commerce. Gradually develop mutual assistance and cooperation among small vendors, and better serve production and consumers. The clerks of private commerce should also unite and supervise capitalists to improve management under the leadership of state-owned commerce, and strive to supply the needs of consumers! The economic work of all economic sectors is not carried out in isolation. They must be coordinated with the work of cultural education, political law and diplomacy, national defense, and so on. In order to realize the Party's general line and the First Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to implement the current guidelines and policies for cultural and educational work, continue to develop and improve cultural and educational undertakings, and cultivate a large number of all kinds of talents who are politically sound and professionally skilled, especially scientific and technical talents and management talents related to industrial construction; and it is necessary to strengthen health work and cultural and artistic work, actively promote people's health, and continuously improve people's socialist awareness and cultural level, so as to ensure the victorious advance of the cause of national construction. Under the situation that the class struggle is increasingly complex and acute during the transition period, the country's economic construction must be closely coordinated with political and legal work. Only by continuously strengthening the state's public security organs, procuratorial organs and judicial organs, and using political law as a powerful weapon to fight against illegal and undisciplined phenomena. Only by severely suppressing those counter-revolutionary elements and punishing all kinds of criminals can we ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation. Facts have proved that strengthening the revolutionary legal system is of decisive significance for maintaining revolutionary order, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and ensuring the country's economic construction. At the same time, under the circumstances that capitalist encirclement still exists, especially when US imperialism continues to occupy our country's Taiwan, still adheres to the so-called "policy of strength," constantly establishes military bases around our country, and constantly creates tension, attempting to threaten our country's security with armed intervention, in order to liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, defend the socialist construction of the motherland, and consolidate peace in Asia and the world, we need to constantly strengthen our national defense strength, strengthen the regularization and modernization of our armed forces. Chairman Mao once instructed: "We will not only have a strong army, but also a strong air force and a strong navy." Only with a solid national defense can the country's economic construction be reliably guaranteed. Therefore, the labor of all staff working in the cultural, educational, health, administrative, judicial, national defense and other departments, including the labor of some freelancers in the cultural and health undertakings, is also indispensable for the realization of the Five-Year Plan, and must be coordinated with each other. To perfectly complete the work of their own posts is to complete the tasks they should shoulder in the Five-Year Plan. Therefore, those arguments such as "the lighthouse of the general line does not shine on the work of the organs" and "the Five-Year Plan has nothing to do with me" are wrong; those views that are not satisfied with the work of their own posts, thinking that "only engaging in industry is serving socialism" are also wrong. Everyone should unite, work conscientiously, overcome difficulties, work hard, and accurately complete the work tasks given to us by the Party and the state. The successful completion of the First Five-Year Plan will enable us to achieve a decisive victory on the road to realizing industrialization and eliminating economic backwardness. People of all ethnic groups and all patriotic people across the country should mobilize themselves, with heroic labor, to strive to complete and overfulfill the great Five-Year Plan. In the new China, the labor of all citizens with labor ability is considered a glorious and decent thing. The state encourages the initiative and creativity of citizens in labor. If a person does a good job and achieves results on the labor front, he will gain honor and glory. If everyone can complete their production and work tasks, the First Five-Year Plan can be fully and perfectly realized. Everyone should know that our hard work today is precisely to strive for a bright and happy future. The happy life that the Soviet people have gained through long-term hard work is our best example. We must learn from the Soviet people and build a bright and splendid socialist country with full confidence.

    一切劳动都是实现五年计划所必需的
    沙英
    第一个五年计划是中国共产党领导全国人民为实现过渡时期总任务而奋斗的带有决定意义的纲领，它正确地反映了全国人民建设我们伟大祖国的共同愿望和共同意志。现在全国人民都热烈地赞扬和拥护这一个计划，都为这个计划所展示出来的我国建设的美丽前景而欢欣鼓舞。
    这样一个伟大的五年计划能不能实现呢？我们可以肯定地说是完全可以实现的。因为这个五年计划不仅符合党的总路线的要求，而且符合我国的实际情况，它是一个以客观的经济规律为依据的科学的计划。同时，我们国家有实现这个计划的许多有利条件，我们在一边编制计划一边进行建设的情况下，这个计划已经胜利地进行两年了。但是如何才能把完成计划的可能性变为现实性，如何完成后三年的工作从而全部完成第一个五年计划呢？这只有依靠全国各族人民在党和政府的领导下，充分利用我们的一切有利条件，发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，辛勤的劳动，努力增产，厉行节约。斯大林教导我们说：“如果以为生产计划就是一张数字表和工作任务一览表，那就是愚蠢的想法了。其实，生产计划是千百万人底活的实际行动。我们的生产计划底实在性，就是创造新生活的千百万劳动者。我们的生产计划底实在性，就是活的人，就是我们自己，我们的劳动意志，我们按新方法来工作的决心，我们执行计划的决心。”（“新的环境和新的经济建设任务”）
    在实行五年计划的斗争中，全国工人阶级担负着特别重大的任务。因为社会主义工业化是社会主义建设的主体，进行基本建设和提高工业生产是五年计划的中心，而这些都是必须通过工人的双手才能完成的。所以说工人阶级担负着主要的任务。这是历史赋与我们工人阶级的新的光荣的使命。在国家经济恢复和发展的过程中，工人阶级已经出了极大的力量，作了极大的贡献。在全国人民面前显示了自己确实不愧为国家的领导阶级和国家企业的主人。特别是在五年计划开始实行之后，热火朝天的劳动竞赛就已经在全国范围内广泛地开展起来。单是在一九五四年一年，全国职工在劳动竞赛中就提出了合理化建议八十四万八千多件，涌现出劳动模范和先进生产者四十三万五千八百一十二人，各种模范生产单位（包括基层、车间、工段、小组和科室等）三万七千零九十七个。例如鞍钢机械总厂的工人王崇伦，创造了对机械部门有重大意义的“万能工具胎”，一年就能完成四年的生产任务，可为国家增产四万五千多元。由于工人阶级这种英勇的劳动，已胜利地完成了五年计划中第一年度和第二年度的计划。现在工人阶级要进一步发挥积极性和创造性，努力提高政治觉悟、技术文化水平和业务水平，开展劳动竞赛，巩固劳动纪律，学习和推广先进经验，不断提高劳动生产率和降低成本，为实现五年计划而斗争。因此，所有国营企业、合作社营企业、公私合营企业和私营企业的工人、职员和从业人员，都应当成为劳动战线上的积极战士。只有工人阶级努力发挥领导的作用，并且以自己的劳动来为国家创造巨大的财富，我国的社会主义建设事业才能胜利完成。
    工业和农业是国民经济的两个主要部门，发展农业正是保证工业发展和全部经济计划完成的基本条件。因为供应全国人民的食粮，供给工业原料，用出口农产品所换得的外汇购买工业设备和建设器材，这都要依靠广大农民的农业增产才能实现。斯大林曾指出：“社会主义社会乃是工业和农业工作人员的一个生产消费组合。如果在这个组合里面，工业与供给原料、粮食和消耗工业品的农业不协调，如果工业与农业因此而不能组成为一个统一的国民经济的整体，——那末，从这里任何社会主义的结果都不可能获得。”（“问题与答复”）因此，在建设社会主义和实现第一个五年计划的斗争中，克服农业的发展过分落后于工业发展的矛盾、是一个非常重大的任务。我国五万万农民就担负着这个重大的任务。
    在过去，我国农民在共产党的领导下，进行了长期艰苦的斗争，付出了很大的代价，取得了人民民主革命的伟大胜利。在解放以后，由于伟大的土地改革运动消灭了封建剥削制度，由于国家对发展农业生产采取了许多正确的政策，广大农民提高了劳动积极性，在生产战线上作出了很大的贡献，使我国的农业生产迅速超过解放前的水平。现在第一个五年计划规定，农业及其副业的总产值在五年内要增长百分之二十三点三，以产量说，粮食要增产百分之十七点六，棉花要增产百分之二十五点四。这是完成整个五年计划所必需的。否则，如果农业生产不能完成计划，那不仅要影响城乡人民的食粮，而且将使绝大多数轻工业因为原料不足而降低发展的速度或完不成生产计划，使进口计划也由于出口物资减少而不能完成。同时，减少轻工业品，就是减低了人民生活需要品的供应；减少进口，就是增加了建设的困难。因此，为了实现五年计划，全国农民应当在各地党和政府的领导下不断提高政治觉悟，努力发展农业生产合作社，改进农业生产技术，兴修水利，精耕细作，开垦荒地，预防和克服灾害，按照国家计划积极增产粮食、棉花、油料和其他经济作物；并且遵守国家的计划，把余粮、棉花和其他农产品卖给国家，努力支援国家的工业建设。因此，为了完成五年计划所规定的农业增产计划，不但国营农场的职工、农业生产合作社社员们的劳动是必不可少的，就是个体农民的劳动也是必不可少的劳动，都是光荣的劳动，他们都负有完成五年计划为他们所规定的任务的责任。
    必须指出，工人和农民是全国最大多数的劳动者，是一切物质财富的主要创造者。社会主义建设和五年计划的实现主要是依靠工人和农民的劳动。同时，工农联盟又是我国人民革命获得胜利的基础，加强和巩固在工人阶级领导下的工农联盟，又是完成第一个五年计划争取社会主义胜利的基础，因此我们应当像爱护眼睛一样来爱护工农联盟。
    国民经济是一个复杂的整体，它的许多部门都必须协调地按比例地发展，这是社会主义经济有计划发展的规律所要求的。否则，就要招致经济生活的混乱而严重地影响社会主义建设事业。我们发展国民经济的五年计划，不仅是工业和农业的计划，同时是其他所有经济部门的计划，它都为所有经济部门规定了具体的任务。因此，各个经济部门都要努力完成五年计划为他们所规定的任务，各个经济部门的工作人员的劳动，包括公私经济部门的工人、职员和从业人员的劳动，都是完成五年计划所必不可少的劳动。如以交通运输业来说，它是国民经济中的主要部门之一，它对发展工农业生产和满足人民的消费需要，都有极其重要的意义。因为运输是生产不可缺少的一个过程。在工业和农业之间、在工业各个部门之间，都必须依靠运输把它们联系起来，才能进行正常的生产。在很多的情况下面，这一个部门的产品，就是另一个部门必不可少的生产资料，如果没有运输，生产就会停顿下来。而且任何生产品如果不经过运输是不能达到消费者手中的，因此运输业在满足人民消费需要方面起重要的作用。现在我们正在进行许多基本建设，大量的机器设备、建筑材料和工人的生活资料也都需要加紧进行运输。同时，交通运输对全国人民政治上的团结、文化上的联系和国防的巩固也起着重要的作用。今后，随着工农业生产的增长，随着商品流转的扩大和加速，随着人民生活的提高，以及为了国防、政治和文化各方面的需要，交通运输业也必须有相应的发展，五年计划为交通运输各部门都规定了具体的任务，不论铁路、水道或公路汽车运输的货物运转量，在五年内都将增长一倍以上。因此，交通运输方面的工作是十分重要的。在这些部门工作的所有人员的劳动都是实现五年计划所必需的，任何轻视交通运输工作的观点都是错误的。再如以商业来说，它也是国民经济中一个重要的部门，它对工农业生产的发展和满足人民日益增长的需要也有重要的意义。因为要沟通工农业间的联系，执行工农业产品的分配，和执行资本主义工商业的社会主义改造等，都离不开商业工作。可以说商业是联结生产和消费的中间环节，是个人消费品分配的基本形式，是城乡经济联系的极其重要的一环。如果商业不能相应地发展，就将造成经济生活的紊乱和脱节。因此，五年计划为国营商业、合作社营商业等规定了具体的任务，在这些部门工作的人员，也都应当积极完成自己的任务。他们的劳动也是实现五年计划所必不可少的。那种轻视商业工作，认为“商业工作没出息”，说什么“商业工作又忙又乱，供应不好有意见，虽在商店当经理，不如政府通讯员”等论调，都是非常错误的，应当加以严格的批判。我们国营商业、供销合作和消费合作社的工作人员，为了完成五年计划所给与的重大任务，应大力开展城乡物资交流，改善经营管理，降低商品流转费用，贯彻国家的计划供应和计划收购政策，认真做好对私营商业的社会主义改造工作，逐步发展小商贩的互助合作，更好地为生产和消费者服务。私营商业的店员们，也应当团结和监督资本家在国营商业的领导下改善经营，为供应消费者的需要而努力！一切经济部门的经济工作不是孤立进行的，它们必须有文化教育、政治法律和外交、国防等等工作的配合。为了实现党的总路线和实现第一个五年计划，就必须贯彻当前文教工作的方针政策，继续发展和改进文化教育事业，大量培养国家所必需的、政治上健全和业务上熟练的各种人材，特别是有关工业建设的科学技术人材和管理人材；并要加强卫生工作和文化艺术工作，积极增进人民的健康，不断提高人民的社会主义觉悟和文化水平，以保障国家建设事业的胜利前进。在过渡时期阶级斗争日益复杂和尖锐的形势下，国家的经济建设必须有政治法律工作的密切配合。只有不断加强国家的公安机关、检察机关和审判机关，用政治法律这个强有力的武器来同违法乱纪的现象作斗争。只有严厉镇压那些反革命分子，惩治各种各样的犯罪分子，才能保障社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利进行。事实证明，加强革命法制对于维护革命秩序、巩固人民民主专政和保障国家经济建设是有决定意义的。同时，在资本主义包围还存在的情况下，特别是美帝国主义继续侵占我国的台湾，仍然坚持所谓“实力政策”，不断在我国周围建立军事基地，不断制造紧张局势，妄图以武装干涉威胁我国安全的情况下，为了解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团、保卫祖国的社会主义建设和巩固亚洲及世界的和平，我们需要不断加强国防力量，加强我国武装部队的正规化和现代化的建设，毛主席曾指示道：“我们将不但有一个强大的陆军，而且有一个强大的空军和一个强大的海军。”只有巩固的国防，国家的经济建设才有可靠的保证。因此，在文化、教育、卫生、行政、司法、国防等部门服务的所有工作人员的劳动，包括文化卫生事业中一部分自由职业者的劳动，也都是实现五年计划必须互相配合和必不可少的劳动。完满地完成自己岗位的工作，也就是完成了五年计划中他们所应当担负的任务。因此，那些“总路线的灯塔照不到机关工作”、“五年计划与我无关”等论调是错误的；那些不安心自己岗位的工作，以为“只有搞工业才是为社会主义服务”等观点也都是错误的。大家都应当团结一致，兢兢业业，克服困难，努力工作，准确地完成党和国家所给与我们的工作任务。胜利地完成第一个五年计划，将使我们在实现工业化消灭经济落后的道路上得到一个具有决定意义的胜利。全国各族人民和一切爱国人士，都应当动员起来，以英勇的劳动，为完成和超额完成伟大的五年计划而奋斗。在新中国，一切有劳动能力的公民的劳动，都被认为是光荣和体面的事情。国家鼓励公民在劳动中的积极性和创造性。一个人如果把工作做好，在劳动战线上有成绩，他就会获得荣誉和光荣。如果大家都能完成自己的生产和工作任务，就能全部完满地实现第一个五年计划。大家要知道，我们今天的艰苦奋斗，正是为了争取美好幸福的将来。苏联人民经过长期艰苦努力得来的美满生活，就是我们最好的榜样。我们要向苏联人民学习，信心百倍地来建设一个光明灿烂的社会主义国家。
