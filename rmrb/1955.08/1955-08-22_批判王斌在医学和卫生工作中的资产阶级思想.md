Criticizing Wang Bin's Bourgeois Ideology in Medicine and Health Work
龚育之　李佩珊

In recent months, the "Health News," the official newspaper of the Ministry of Health, has launched a critique of Wang Bin, former Minister of Health of the Northeast People's Government and former Deputy Minister of the Central Ministry of Health, regarding his bourgeois ideology in medicine and health work. This critique is of great significance.

Wang Bin is an important representative of bourgeois ideology in the health sector. He has consistently promoted bourgeois ideology, opposed Marxist-Leninist thought, opposed the Party's guidelines and policies, and opposed the cause of socialist construction in the medical and health work sectors.

First, on the issue of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Wang Bin propagated an extremely base, extremely vile bourgeois sectarian and slavish ideology that blindly negated TCM, and put forward a set of implementation measures to exclude and eliminate TCM, which directly opposed the Party's policy of uniting with TCM.

At the same time, Wang Bin's bourgeois ideology is also manifested in other aspects. For example, in dealing with Western medicine, Wang Bin held an erroneous idea that violated the Party's policy of uniting with Western medicine. On the issue of medical education, Wang Bin advocated a set of pragmatic educational theories and practices called the "image teaching method."

Wang Bin's bourgeois ideas had a wide impact in the medical and health departments for a long time without thorough criticism and eradication, causing serious damage to the people's health cause.

We are engaged in socialist construction, and our enemies are trying every means to sabotage socialist construction. The erosion of bourgeois ideology in various work sectors, under today's historical conditions in our country, is one of the main means by which our enemies sabotage socialism and is one of the main forms of class struggle. Medical and health work, with the responsibility of safeguarding the people's lives, health, and labor capacity, and enhancing the happiness of the people's lives, occupies a very important position in the cause of socialist construction. The erosion of bourgeois ideology in the medical and health work sector is a very important aspect of our enemies' activities to sabotage socialist construction.

We are conducting a struggle against bourgeois ideology and defending socialist construction on all fronts. The struggle against Wang Bin's bourgeois ideology in medicine and health work is an important component of this ideological front. It is a key to improving the work of the medical and health departments to meet the requirements of socialist construction.

Wang Bin's erroneous ideas of negating and eliminating TCM are concentrated in his report entitled "A Certain Medical and Health Organizational Form and Ideological Style Arise on a Certain Political and Economic Basis," which he made at the Fourth Northeast Health Conference in 1950 when he served as Minister of Health of the Northeast People's Government. In this article, Wang Bin put forward a "program" for eliminating TCM that was fully equipped from theory to methods. This article was also published in the "Northeast Health" magazine, Volume 1, Issue 9, and was later printed and distributed everywhere, compiled into booklets such as "The Road of Medical Workers," as "ideological study documents for health personnel" and "political teaching materials," and organized for study among the vast number of medical personnel and health work cadres in the Northeast region and other regions of the country. "Northeast Health" magazine also published a commentary entitled "Further Study of Minister Wang Bin's Thesis," praising Wang Bin's article as "Marxist," "dialectical materialist," "policy-oriented thesis" with "class character and practicality," and stipulated it as a "guide to action" that every health worker must abide by. Some health cadres praised Wang Bin's remarks as "profound truths" and the "golden key to opening the future of health undertakings in the Northeast." Because this thesis was so touted and widely disseminated, Wang Bin's set of erroneous ideas had a very deep influence, spread widely, and caused great harm.

What "theories" did Wang Bin have to negate TCM?

The first "argument" he used to negate TCM was that TCM has no practical efficacy in treating diseases. In his own paper, he said: "They (TCM practitioners) are all unqualified, they can only play a role of spiritual comfort for farmers in front of them."

Obviously, this is a very arbitrary and despicable way to obliterate the facts! The facts are very clear: The Chinese people have created and developed their own medicine in their thousands of years of struggle against diseases. This medicine, including prevention and treatment, from internal, external, gynecology, and pediatrics to medicine, stones, acupuncture, and moxibustion, from vast medical books to the existing experience of vast numbers of TCM practitioners and folk remedies spread among the people, is very rich in content. Our ancestors have relied on this medicine for generations to prevent and treat diseases. The survival, development, prosperity, and strength of the Chinese people, and their growth into a large country of 600 million people, owe a great contribution to TCM. Until now, more than half of the urban residents and almost all rural residents in our country, that is, more than 500 million people, still rely on TCM as the main force for disease prevention and treatment. TCM can indeed cure many diseases, and this is fully trusted by the people of our country. Many facts of TCM curing diseases can be found everywhere, and even some diseases that are difficult to treat or have low curative effects with modern medicine often have good results with TCM treatment. Wang Bin, as a leading staff member of the health department, cannot be unaware of these facts, but he dismissed them all, insisting that TCM "can only play a role of spiritual comfort in front of farmers." How arbitrary and despicable is this!

The second "argument" Wang Bin used to negate TCM was that TCM is unscientific. In his paper, he said: TCM is "unqualified when measured by scientific knowledge"; the people believe in TCM because they "lack scientific knowledge"; "from the perspective of pure scientific medicine, abolishing them is for the sake of the people"…

However, Wang Bin's set of "arguments" cannot withstand refutation at all. Marxism believes that the standard for testing scientific truth is practice. TCM has cured countless diseases for thousands of years, and it is still curing diseases now. These indisputable facts prove that TCM does contain scientific content. The scientific content of TCM that has been verified by practice cannot be subjectively erased by anyone. It is true that the rich experience in treating diseases accumulated by TCM on the basis of long-term and extensive practice has not been able to obtain theoretical explanations and generalizations that meet modern scientific standards due to the limitations of historical conditions. However, facing this situation, what should the real scientific attitude be? Should we cherish these practical experiences, research, sort out, and improve them according to modern science to enrich modern medical science, or should we dismiss these practical experiences as "unscientific" and discard them? Wang Bin talks about "science" and "science" all the time, but he originally attempted to use the signboard of "science" to achieve the despicable goal of negating the experience of TCM in treating diseases. This is precisely a violation of the basic spirit of science, and there is not even a trace of science!

Erasing the fact that TCM can indeed cure diseases, ignoring the experience of TCM in treating diseases, and denying practice as the standard for testing scientific truth is a complete subjectivism and idealism.

However, Wang Bin wanted to decorate his bourgeois idealism as the Marxism of the working class. In his paper, he created a set of seemingly Marxist "theories," that TCM is the "feudal doctor" and "feudal medicine" of "feudal society," which should disappear with the demise of feudal society. This is the third "argument" Wang Bin used to negate TCM.

Obviously, this is not a Marxist theory, but only an anti-Marxist theory. Medicine, like other natural science departments, as a social ideology, its development is together with the entire social development and is constrained by social development, which is beyond doubt. At the same time, medicine, like other natural science departments, is not only the product of a certain social era and a certain economic base, nor does it disappear with the demise of a certain social era and a certain economic base. It is the knowledge of objective natural laws that has been inherited and accumulated by generations in the long historical development of human society, which is also beyond doubt. Lenin taught us: "Marxism never discards the most valuable achievements of the bourgeois era, on the contrary, it accepts and transforms everything valuable in the development of human thought and culture for more than two thousand years." The view that all cultural and scientific heritage of the old era should be discarded as "feudal" and "capitalist" things is precisely the reactionary so-called "proletarian cultural faction" and "cavemen" views that Lenin and Stalin repeatedly condemned, and is a nihilistic view of cultural heritage.

This is all the "theoretical" basis for Wang Bin's negation of TCM.

Wang Bin not only attempted to negate TCM in theory, but also attempted to eliminate TCM in practice. In order to achieve this goal, he first maliciously distorted the Party's clearly announced policy of uniting with TCM. Wang Bin declared: TCM was originally "unqualified," not only "can only play a role of spiritual comfort for farmers in front of them," but also "even some quacks kill people," "abolishing" TCM was originally "for the sake of the people," only because "today's New China was born not long ago, and there is not enough time to train a large number of new doctors with scientific level and experience to replace them," and "the people's cultural level is not high, lack of scientific knowledge, do not know why TCM should be banned," that's why "we cannot take the approach of overthrowing them." Then, Wang Bin put forward a set of specific measures to eliminate TCM: first, to transform existing TCM practitioners into Western medicine "medical assistants" through "short-term training"; second, "to stop them (TCM practitioners) from recruiting apprentices in the future," that is, not only to eliminate existing TCM practitioners, but also to cut off the continued production of TCM, so as to eliminate the roots!

It is true that Wang Bin's set of measures to eliminate TCM was not able to be implemented as smoothly as he expected due to the correction of the Party Central Committee and the opposition of the broad masses of cadres and people. Nevertheless, these measures have still brought about bad consequences in practice, damaging the Party's prestige among the vast number of TCM practitioners, failing to give full play to the strength of the vast number of TCM practitioners, and causing serious losses to the people's health cause.

It must be pointed out that the erroneous ideas of negating, excluding, and attempting to eliminate TCM are not new. This is a bourgeois slavish ideology that has long existed in our society, blindly worshiping Western culture and despising and negating our own national cultural heritage. Modern medical science was introduced to our country from the West. Thanks to the hard work of the Chinese people, modern medicine has been spread and developed in our country in recent decades and has become the Chinese people's own medicine. Modern medicine is based on all modern natural sciences and is advanced. Its introduction to China is very beneficial to the Chinese people. In the past, the feudal forces in our country opposed the spread of Western medicine in China, which was backward and reactionary. The Chinese people never reject, and have always been good at absorbing, all foreign progressive cultures to serve the Chinese people. The Chinese people have always opposed all self-aggrandizement and conservative backward ideas that stick to old ways. However, there is another erroneous idea on the issue of Western culture, that is, the idea of the Chinese bourgeoisie blindly worshiping Western culture. They kneel down to Western culture in a slavish manner, regardless of whether it is dross or essence, whether it is beneficial or harmful to the Chinese people, and they all burn incense and bow down to it; conversely, they despise their own national culture in every possible way, believing that there is nothing to take and should all be thrown into the garbage heap. Hu Shih's "complete Westernization" is the representative of this slavish ideology. This slavish ideology, manifested in the treatment of the national medical heritage, is to blindly negate TCM, not hesitating to erase the iron fact that TCM has cured countless diseases for thousands of years, heartlessly adopt an indifferent attitude towards the lives and health of thousands of people in front of them, exclude and打击 TCM everywhere, and even attempt to eliminate TCM. This is an extremely base and extremely vile bourgeois ideology. It has led to the long-term opposition between Chinese and Western medicine in our society, and it has led to the measures of successive reactionary governments to ignore and exclude TCM. In 1914, Yuan Shikai's government issued a statement "abolishing TCM and not using Chinese medicine." In 1929, the Central Health Committee of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary government passed a resolution proposed by Yu Yunxiu and others, who consistently advocated the elimination of TCM, "abolishing TCM." This has made it so that in recent decades, not only has the strength of TCM not been fully utilized to serve the people's health care, but also the development of TCM and the cause of sorting out and improving it on the basis of modern science have suffered great losses, and there is even a serious danger of gradual loss and extinction.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the situation in this regard has undergone fundamental changes. However, the extremely base and extremely vile bourgeois ideology of negating and eliminating TCM, which had long existed in the old society, has not disappeared. Even Yu Yunxiu, who had suggested to the Chiang Kai-shek government to eliminate TCM, still clamored after the founding of the People's Republic of China: "There is no room for the continued existence of old doctors," and openly proposed his "old doctor handling plan" again at the First National Health Conference. But more seriously, this bourgeois ideology has put on a new disguise of "Marxism," continuing to deceive and spread poison among the masses, and even penetrated the health leadership department, influencing the formulation and implementation of policies. Wang Bin's ideas of negating and eliminating TCM are essentially the concentration of this extremely base and extremely vile bourgeois ideology, which is wearing a "Marxist" disguise and has penetrated the health leadership department.

Wang Bin's bourgeois ideology is not only manifested in the issue of TCM, but also in the issues of Western medicine and medical education.

In his paper, "A Certain Medical and Health Organizational Form and Ideological Style Arise on a Certain Political and Economic Basis," Wang Bin not only put forward the so-called "feudal doctor" theory of "feudal society," but also put forward the so-called "capitalist doctor" theory of "capitalist society." He made many far-fetched comparisons between the old Western medicine and capitalist production in our country, and put thirteen hats on the old Western medicine in our country, such as "ownership," "commodification," "profit viewpoint," "private ownership," "colonialism," "bureaucratization," "monopoly and hoarding," and "speculation," so as to argue that the old Western medicine in our country is the so-called "capitalist doctor" and should be discarded. Obviously, this is still the nihilistic view of cultural heritage that has been criticized before, which is very wrong.

As for the most harmful point of the so-called "capitalist doctor" fallacy in practical work, it is Wang Bin's saying that "the opposition between doctors and patients in the old society is the same as the opposition between capitalists and the proletariat." Moreover, Wang Bin not only compared Western doctors in the old society to capitalists, but even compared doctors who freely practiced medicine in the new China today to private capitalism. It is very clear that doctors are people with medical knowledge, intellectuals, cultural workers, and mental workers. In the old society, the vast majority of them were either employed by capitalists or were self-employed. Their class status is essentially different from that of capitalists, and their relationship with patients has nothing to do with labor-capital opposition. Lenin taught us: "We should not adopt a picky policy towards specialists. These specialists are not the servants of exploiters, but cultural workers. They served the bourgeoisie in bourgeois society, and socialists all over the world have said that these people will serve us in proletarian society." In order to build socialism, we must unite with all cultural workers and all Western doctors in the old society; any view and practice that treats them as capitalists and excludes and despises them violates the interests of socialist construction. Even today, doctors who practice privately, as independent laborers, their labor still has a positive significance for the socialist construction of our country.

On the issue of medical education, Wang Bin is the most active supporter, promoter, and implementer of the erroneous policy of "specialty-focused system" in higher medical education. The so-called "specialty-focused system" in higher medical education emphasizes "integration of teaching, learning, and application," emphasizes "basic courses subordinate to clinical courses, clinical courses subordinate to practical needs," emphasizes that the more detailed the specialization, the better, emphasizes that teaching should have "key points" (actually negating the scientific system, forming fragmentation), emphasizes short-term training (even as short as one or two years)… In this way, students educated by the "specialty-focused system" lack systematic basic medical theory training, so it is impossible to truly master the science of medicine, it is impossible to truly understand a specialized knowledge of a branch thoroughly, it is impossible to creatively use medical knowledge to solve complex practical problems, and it is even more impossible to take on the task of developing medical science, but can only learn some fragmented practical medical techniques in a small department. It is not difficult to see that such a "specialty-focused system," as a general policy of higher medical education, is a bourgeois pragmatic policy, and has nothing in common with Marxist educational thought. However, Wang Bin touted it as a "new idea" of "proletarian worldview dialectical materialism," a "specific manifestation of Marxism-Leninism in medical education," and regarded it as a "comprehensive plan for the new medical education revolution," a direction of "new democratic new Chinese new medicine" that must be implemented in "different spaces and times."

At the same time, in order to implement the "specialty-focused system," Wang Bin also created a so-called "image teaching method," believing that the use of the "image teaching method" can "complete the courses of five or six years in one year" and meet the requirements of "specialty-focused education" in short-term training. Under the name of "image teaching method," Wang Bin emphasized "integration of listening, watching, and doing," emphasized "the teaching method of consistency between theory and practice is not active enough, image teaching method is practice over theory," advocated "eliminating the classroom, the base of dogmatism," and promoted "experimental classrooms," "equipment and instruments replacing chalk, the body replacing the blackboard"; at the same time, he also opposed textbooks, advocated "few words and many pictures, clear at a glance" "image lecture notes," and advocated using "various forms of culture such as poetry, cartoons, woodcuts, music, drama…" to "express medicine," believing that this is the "rational part of knowledge," which will inevitably and indeed develop to the point where, in order to have "few words and many pictures," he does not hesitate to "draw a picture of a lush spring scene" instead of writing the two words "spring season." It is very clear that Wang Bin's set of "image teaching methods" develops from opposing systematic theoretical lectures to opposing language and writing and opposing abstract thinking. This is a culmination of empiricism and pragmatism.

The combination of "specialty-focused system" and "image teaching method" is a complete set of bourgeois pragmatic educational thought in our country's medical education. In order to adapt to the increasing needs of socialist construction for medical and health work, reforming our country's old medical education system, eliminating the influence of bourgeois ideology in old medical education, and improving the work of medical cadre training are very important tasks. To this end, we must strengthen the study of Marxist educational theory and learn from the advanced experience of Soviet medical education to improve our work; at the same time, we must oppose any attempt to transform our country's medical education with bourgeois pragmatic educational thought, thereby hindering socialist construction.

It should be pointed out that Wang Bin's mistakes have been repeatedly criticized seriously by the Party. However, Wang Bin has always refused the Party's criticism and insisted on his own mistakes. Recently, after "Health News" launched a public criticism of Wang Bin's erroneous ideas under the leadership of the Party, Wang Bin wrote two counter-criticisms. In these two counter-criticism articles, although he had to admit verbally that "the policy of uniting Chinese and Western medicine is absolutely correct," in fact, he did not face up to his own mistakes at all, did not examine his own mistakes, but tried to quibble in every possible way, trying to cover up his own mistakes. Wang Bin clearly said that TCM is "feudal medicine" and "feudal doctor," but now he insists that this is a "shortened writing" of "the organizational form and ideological style of medicine and health in the feudal society"; he clearly used "can only play a role of spiritual comfort in front of farmers" to negate the efficacy of TCM in treating diseases, but now he shamelessly says that "comforting effect" is "Pavlov's protective medical system"; as for "stop them (TCM practitioners) from recruiting apprentices in the future," Wang Bin openly says that this "is just written in the article" (you should know that this is Wang Bin, who was the Minister of Health of the Northeast People's Government, reported at the Fourth Northeast Health Conference, and was published in the organ journal of the Northeast Health Department as a "policy-oriented thesis" as a "guide to action"!) "there is no regulation in any regulations." Moreover, Wang Bin not only covered up his own mistakes, but also reaffirmed his estimate of TCM and his approach to dealing with TCM after putting forward the above "explanation," and insisted on his own mistakes. More seriously, Wang Bin not only insisted on his own mistakes, but also reversed black and white and maliciously attacked those who criticized him, thereby launching a counterattack against this criticism movement, and finally rejected the criticism of him by the Party and the people.

In medical and health work, propagating all kinds of bourgeois ideas, adhering to these erroneous ideas, and resisting and slandering the criticism of the Party and the people, this kind of bad behavior is absolutely incompatible with the glorious title of revolutionary and the glorious status of state staff. Finally, it must also be pointed out that the reason why Wang Bin's bourgeois ideas can freely spread and spread influence in the medical and health work department and bring losses to the people's health cause is inseparable from the approval and support of some responsible comrades in the health leadership department. The reason why these responsible comrades support and agree with Wang Bin's bourgeois ideas, as Minister of Health Li Dequan pointed out in her recent speech at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, is because they "have not seriously studied and implemented the Party and the government's guidelines and policies, lack politics, and are self-righteous, and do not respect the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao." Taking the policy of uniting Chinese and Western medicine as an example, the Party and Chairman Mao have always had very clear instructions. As early as the Anti-Japanese War, the Party and Chairman Mao put forward this policy. During the First National Health Conference in 1950, Chairman Mao once again instructed: "Unite the old and new, Chinese and Western medical and health workers to form a solid united front and fight for the development of the great people's health work." However, some responsible comrades in the health leadership department did not fully value and earnestly implement the Party's policy, but were dominated by bourgeois ideas, supported Wang Bin's mistakes, and pursued policies that were directly contrary to the Party's policy, thereby causing great losses to health work.

Lin Feng, Director of the Second Office of the State Council, also criticized some responsible comrades of the Ministry of Health in his speech at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress for "violating the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to unite Chinese and Western medicine," criticized them for "not fundamentally changing in actual work after the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao repeatedly pointed out this kind of principled error," and pointed out that this is a kind of "not asking about politics, not paying attention to the study of Marxism-Leninism… not respecting the leadership of the Communist Party" error, and pointed out that this kind of non-political tendency is precisely a manifestation of bourgeois ideology. Comrade Lin Feng particularly emphasized the necessity of respecting the leadership of the Communist Party, he said: "Particularly important, all cultural and educational workers must realize that they can only do their work well by relying on the leadership of the Communist Party. The Communist Party of China, armed with invincible Marxism-Leninism, can not only victoriously lead military struggles and political struggles, but also can victoriously lead the country's economic construction, and can fully lead and must lead cultural and educational work. Countless facts prove that any revolutionary work cannot move forward without Marxism-Leninism and the leadership of the Party. Any idea that the Party cannot lead cultural and educational work is extremely wrong and must be corrected."

Comrade Lin Feng's remarks have a principled and important significance for the health department and for all cultural and educational departments such as science, literature, art, and education.

We are building socialism. The most important condition for guaranteeing the victory of socialist construction is the strong leadership and strict supervision of the Party over all work departments. An important means by which the enemy sabotages our socialist construction is to undermine the Party's leadership and supervision. We must strive to oppose the erosion of all bourgeois ideas, strive to oppose all tendencies to deviate from the Party's leadership, and advance victoriously on the road of socialist construction!

    批判王斌在医学和卫生工作中的资产阶级思想
    龚育之　李佩珊
    最近几个月来，卫生部机关报“健康报”展开了对前东北人民政府卫生部部长、前中央卫生部副部长王斌在医学和卫生工作中的资产阶级思想的批判。这个批判，具有十分重大的意义。
    王斌是卫生部门中资产阶级思想的重要代表人物。他一贯地在医学和卫生工作部门宣扬资产阶级思想，反对马克思列宁主义思想，反对党的方针和政策，反对社会主义建设事业。
    首先，在对待中医的问题上，王斌宣扬一种盲目否定中医的极端卑鄙、极端恶劣的资产阶级宗派主义思想和奴化思想，并且提出了一套同党的团结中医的政策正相对抗的排挤和消灭中医的实施办法。
    同时，王斌的资产阶级思想还表现在其他方面。例如，在对待西医的问题上，王斌持有一种违背党的团结西医政策的错误思想。在医学教育问题上，王斌倡导一套所谓“形象教学法”的实用主义的教育理论和实践。
    王斌的这些资产阶级思想，在医学和卫生部门曾经有过广泛的影响，长期以来，没有得到彻底的批判和肃清，给人民保健事业带来了严重的损害。
    我们正在进行社会主义建设，我们的敌人正在千方百计破坏社会主义建设。资产阶级思想对各个工作部门的侵蚀，在我国今天的历史条件下，是我们的敌人破坏社会主义的主要手段之一，是阶级斗争的主要形式之一。医学和卫生工作，以保障人民的生命健康和劳动能力，增进人民生活的幸福为职责，在社会主义建设事业中占着十分重要的地位。资产阶级思想对医学和卫生工作部门的侵蚀，正是我们的敌人破坏社会主义建设的活动的一个十分重要的方面。
    我们正在各个战线上进行反对资产阶级思想，保卫社会主义建设的斗争。反对王斌在医学和卫生工作中的资产阶级思想的斗争，正是这个思想战线的一个重要组成部分。它是改进医学和卫生部门的工作以适应社会主义建设要求的一个关键。
    王斌的否定和消灭中医的错误思想，集中地表现在一九五○年他担任东北人民政府卫生部部长时，在东北第四次卫生会议上所作的题为“在一定的政治经济基础上产生一定的医药卫生组织形式与思想作风”的报告中。在这篇文章中王斌提出了一套从理论到办法都完全具备的消灭中医的“纲领”。这篇文章同时发表在“东北卫生”杂志第一卷第九期上，后来又到处印行，编入“医务工作者的道路”之类的小册子，作为“卫生人员思想学习文件”和“政治教材”，在东北地区和全国其他地区的广大医务人员和卫生工作干部中组织过学习。“东北卫生”杂志还曾经发表题为“进一步学习王斌部长的论文”的评论，把王斌的文章吹捧为“马克思主义的”、“辩证唯物的”，“具有阶级性和实践性”的“政策性论文”的“典范”，把它规定为每一个卫生工作者必须尊奉的“行动指南”。有的卫生干部把王斌的议论赞为“至理名言”和“打开东北卫生事业前途之门的金锁钥”。由于这篇论文被如此吹嘘，广为传播，王斌这套错误思想也就影响极深，流毒很广，危害甚大。
    王斌究竟有些什么“理论”来否定中医呢？
    他用来否定中医的第一个“论据”便是：中医没有实际治病的效力。他在自己的论文里说：“他们（中医）都是不合格的，他们只能在农民面前起到精神上有医生治疗的安慰作用。”
    显然，这是一种十分武断而卑劣的抹煞事实的说法！事实十分清楚：中国人民在几千年来同疾病作斗争中，创造和发展了自己的医学。这个医学，包括从预防到治疗，从内外妇幼各科到药石针灸各法，从浩繁的医药典籍到现有广大中医的经验和散遍民间的验术偏方，内容十分丰富。我们的祖宗辈辈就是依靠这个医学来防治疾病的。我国人民的生存发展，繁荣昌盛，以至成长为六亿人口的大国，中医有着伟大的贡献。直到现在，我国半数以上的城市居民和几乎全部农村居民，即约五亿以上的人口，仍然依靠中医为防治疾病的主要力量。中医确能治好许多疾病，这在我国人民中是有着充分的信任的。到处都可以发现许多中医治好了病的事实，甚至有一些现代医学尚难于治疗或疗效不高的疾病，中医治疗常常能有良好的效果。身为卫生部门领导工作人员的王斌，不能不知道这些事实，而竟一笔抹煞，硬说中医“只能起到精神上有医生治疗的安慰作用”，这是何等武断而卑劣！
    王斌用来否定中医的第二个“论据”便是：中医不科学。他在自己的论文里说：中医以“科学知识来衡量，都是不合格的”；人民相信中医，那是因为“缺乏科学知识”的缘故；“从单纯科学医学来看，取消他们是为了人民”……
    然而，王斌这一套“论据”也丝毫经不起驳斥。马克思主义认为：检证科学真理的标准，是实践。中医数千年来曾经治好无数疾病，而且现在仍然在治好疾病，这些无可辩驳的事实，证明了中医里面确实包含着科学的内容。中医的为实践所验证了的科学内容，是不容任何人加以主观抹煞的。不错，中医在长期而广泛的实践基础上积累起来的丰富的治病经验，由于历史条件的限制，未能获得合乎现代科学水平的理论说明和概括。但是，面对着这种情况，真正的科学态度应当是怎样的呢？是应该十分珍视这些实践经验，根据现代科学加以研究、整理和提高，用以丰富现代医学科学呢，还是把这些实践经验一概斥之为“不科学”而弃置不顾呢？王斌口口声声“科学”、“科学”，而原来是企图假借“科学”的招牌，达到否定中医治病经验的卑劣目的，这恰恰违背了科学的基本精神，那里还有半点科学的气息！
    抹煞中医确能治病的事实，忽视中医治病的经验，否认实践作为检证科学真理的标准，这是一种十足的主观主义、唯心主义。
    但是，王斌却要把他的资产阶级唯心主义，装璜成工人阶级的马克思主义。他在自己的论文里制造了一套似乎是马克思主义的“理论”，即中医是
  “封建社会”的“封建医”、“封建医学”，应当随着封建社会的消灭而消灭的“理论”。这便是王斌用来否定中医的第三个“论据”。
    显然，这并不是什么马克思主义理论，只能是一种反马克思主义的理论。医学，正如其他自然科学部门，作为一种社会意识形态，它的发展是和整个社会发展一起，并且受到社会发展的制约，这是毫无疑问的。同时，医学，正如其他自然科学部门，它不仅仅是某一个社会时代、某一种经济基础的产物，也不随某一个社会时代、某一种经济基础的消灭而消灭，它是人类社会长期历史发展中世代继承和积累起来的关于客观自然规律的知识，这也是毫无疑问的。列宁教导我们：“马克思主义从不抛弃资产阶级时代最有价值的成就，相反地，它正是把人类思想和文化两千多年的发展中一切有价值的东西接受过来并加以改造。”把旧时代的一切文化科学遗产一概当作“封建的”和“资本主义的”东西加以抛弃的观点，则正是列宁和斯大林一再申斥过的反动的所谓“无产阶级文化派”和“穴居野人”的观点，是一种对文化遗产的虚无主义的观点。
    这便是王斌否定中医的全部“理论”根据。
    王斌不仅企图在理论上否定中医，而且企图在实践上消灭中医。为了达到这样的目的，他首先便来恶意歪曲党所明确宣布的团结中医的方针。王斌宣称：中医本来是“不合格”的，不仅“只能在农民面前起到精神上有医生治疗的安慰作用”，而且
  “甚至有的庸医杀人”，“取消”中医本来是“为了人民”，仅仅是由于“今天新中国诞生不久，尚来不及培养大批有科学水平与经验的新医生去置换”，而且“人民文化程度不高，缺乏科学知识，不知为什么要取缔中医”，这才“不能采取打倒他们的方针”。然后，王斌便提出了一套消灭中医的具体办法，第一，将现有中医经“短期训练”改造为西医“医助”，第二，“停止其（中医）今后招收学徒”，即不仅要消灭现有中医，而且要断绝中医的继续产生，以便斩草除根！
    不错，王斌这套消灭中医的措施，由于党中央的纠正以及广大干部和人民群众的反对，没有能够如他所期望的那样顺利贯彻。虽然如此，这些措施在实践中仍然已经带来了恶劣的后果，使党在广大中医中的威信受到破坏，广大中医的力量未能充分发挥，人民保健事业受到严重损失。
    必须指出，否定、排斥和企图消灭中医的错误思想，并不是什么新奇的东西。这是一种在我国社会长期存在过的资产阶级的盲目崇拜西洋文化，轻视和否定自己民族文化遗产的奴化思想。现代医学科学，是从西方传入我国来的。由于中国人民努力学习，近几十年来现代医学在我国传播和发展，成为了中国人民自己的医学。现代医学以全部现代自然科学为基础，是先进的，它之传入中国，于中国人民是十分有益的。过去我国封建势力反对西医在中国传播，则是落后的，反动的。中国人民从不拒绝、而且从来善于吸收一切外国的进步文化，使之为中国人民服务。中国人民从来反对一切妄自尊大、故步自封的保守落后思想。但是，在对待西洋文化问题上，却存在着另一种错误思想，即我国资产阶级盲目崇拜西洋文化的思想。他们奴颜婢膝地拜倒在西洋文化面前，不管它是糟粕还是精华，于中国人民有利还是无利，一律都焚香顶礼；反过来，对于自己民族文化，则百般鄙视，认为一无可取之处，应当统统抛到垃圾堆里去。胡适之流的
  “全盘西化”便是这种奴化思想的代表。这种奴化思想，表现在对待民族医学遗产上，便是盲目否定中医，不惜抹煞几千年来中医治好了无数疾病这个铁的事实，忍心对眼前千千万万人民的生命和健康采取漠不关心的态度，处处排挤和打击中医，直至企图消灭中医。这是一种极端卑鄙，极端恶劣的资产阶级思想。它导致了我国社会中西医长期对立的局面，它导致了历届反动政府漠视和排挤中医的措施。一九一四年袁世凯政府便曾发表过“废止中医、不用中药”的谈话。一九二九年蒋介石反动政府的中央卫生委员会曾经通过了一贯主张消灭中医的分子余云岫等提出的“废止中医”的决议。这就使得近几十年来，不但中医的力量未能充分发挥为人民的保健服务，而且中医学术的发展和在近代科学基础上整理和提高的事业，蒙受莫大的损失，甚至有日渐散失和泯灭的严重危险。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，这方面的情况发生了根本的变化。但是，旧社会长期存在过的否定和消灭中医的极端卑鄙、极端恶劣的资产阶级思想，却并没有销声匿迹。就是那个曾经向蒋介石政府建议消灭中医的余云岫，在中华人民共和国成立以后，仍然大肆叫嚣：“没有旧医继续存在的余地”，并且公然在第一届全国卫生会议上再次提出了他的
  “旧医处理方案”。但更严重的是：这种资产阶级思想竟披上了“马克思主义”的新的伪装，继续在群众中进行欺骗，散布毒害，而且更钻进了卫生领导部门，影响着政策的制定和执行。王斌否定和消灭中医的思想，实质上正是这种集中起来而且披着
  “马克思主义”伪装，钻进了卫生领导部门的极端卑鄙、极端恶劣的资产阶级思想。
    王斌的资产阶级思想，不仅表现在对待中医的问题上，同时也表现在对待西医和医学教育问题上。
    王斌在他的论文：“在一定的政治经济基础上产生一定的医学卫生组织形式与思想作风”中，不但提出了所谓“封建社会”的“封建医”的“理论”，同时还提出了所谓“资本主义社会”的“资本主义医”的“理论”。他把我国旧有西医和资本主义生产作了许多牵强附会的比拟，在我国旧有西医的头上戴了“占有性”、“商品化”、“利润观点”、“私有制”、“殖民地性”、“官僚化”、
  “垄断与居奇”、“投机”等十三顶帽子，从而论证我国旧有西医是所谓“资本主义医”，应当抛弃。显然，这仍然是前面已经批判过的十分错误的对待文化遗产的虚无主义的观点。
    至于所谓“资本主义医”的谬论在实际工作中最为有害的一点，就是王斌的所谓在旧社会里“医生与病人的对立，也等于资本家与无产阶级对立一样”。而且，王斌不仅把旧社会的西医比做资本家，甚至把现在新中国的自由开业的医生也比作私人资本主义。十分清楚，医生是有医学知识的人，是知识分子，是文化工作者，是脑力劳动者。在旧社会里他们绝大多数或者为资本家所雇佣，或者是自由职业者。他们的阶级地位，和资本家有着本质的不同，他们和病人的关系根本扯不上劳资对立的关系。列宁教导我们：“对专门家，我们不应采取吹毛求疵的政策，这些专门家不是剥削者的佣仆，而是文化工作者，他们在资产阶级社会里曾服务于资产阶级，而全世界社会主义者都曾说，这些人在无产阶级社会里是会向我们服务的。”为了建设社会主义，我们必须团结旧社会全体文化工作者，团结全体西医；任何把他们当作资本家而加以排斥和唾弃的看法和做法，都是违背社会主义建设的利益的。即使今天私人开业的医生，作为独立劳动者，他们的劳动对于我国的社会主义建设仍然具有积极的意义。
    在医学教育问题上，王斌是所谓高等医学教育中的“专科重点制”错误方针的最积极的支持者、鼓吹者和实行者。所谓高等医学教育中的“专科重点制”，强调“教、学、用合一”，强调“基础课服从临床课，临床课服从现实需要”，强调分科越细越好，强调教学要有“重点”（实际上否定了科学的系统，形成割裂），强调短期训练（甚至短到一年、两年）……这样，“专科重点制”教育出来的学生，既缺乏系统的基础医学理论的训练，就不可能真正掌握医学这门科学，不可能真正透彻了解一个分科的专门知识，不可能创造性地运用医学知识来解决复杂的实际问题，更不可能担当发展医学科学的任务，仅仅只能学到某一个细小部门的若干割裂了的实用的医疗技术。不难看出，这样的“专科重点制”，作为一种普遍的高等医学教育方针，正是一种资产阶级实用主义的方针，和马克思主义的教育思想是毫无共同之处的。然而，王斌却把它吹嘘成“无产阶级宇宙观辩证法唯物论”的“新思想”，
  “马列主义在医学教育中的具体表现”，把它当作是“全面的新医学教育革命的计划”，是在“不同的空间和时间”都必须贯彻的“新民主主义新中国的新医学”的方向。
    同时，王斌为了贯彻“专科重点制”，还创造了一套所谓“形象教学法”，认为运用“形象教学法”可以“在一年内学完五、六年的课程”，达到短期训练的“专科重点教育”的要求。王斌在“形象教学法”的名目下，强调“听、看、做合一”，强调“理论与实践一致的教学法还不够积极，形象教学法是实践重于理论”，主张“消灭教条主义根据地课堂”，提倡“实验教室”，“器材仪器代替粉笔，肉体代替黑板”；同时，还反对教科书，提倡
  “字少图多、一目了然”的“形象讲义”，提倡用“诗歌、漫画、木刻、音乐、戏剧……”等“文化的各种形式”“表现医学”，认为这就是“知识的理性部分”，这样就势必会、而且事实上也的确发展到为了“字少图多”，不惜“画一幅枝叶茂盛的春景”来代替书写“春季”这两个字。十分清楚，王斌这一套“形象教学法”从反对系统的理论讲授，发展到反对语言文字，反对抽象思惟，这是一种登峰造极的经验主义、实用主义。
      “专科重点制”和“形象教学法”搭配在一起，是我国医学教育中的一套完整的资产阶级实用主义教育思想。为了适应社会主义建设对于医学和卫生工作的日益增长的需要，改革我国旧有医学教育制度，清除旧有医学教育中的资产阶级思想影响，改善医学干部培养的工作，是十分重要的任务。为此，就必须加强学习马克思主义的教育理论，学习苏联医学教育的先进经验，用来改进我们的工作；同时必须反对任何用资产阶级实用主义教育思想来改造我国医学教育，从而阻碍社会主义建设的企图。
    应当指出，王斌的这些错误，曾经一再受到党的严肃的批评。但是王斌始终拒绝党的批评，坚持自己的错误。最近，“健康报”在党的领导下展开了对王斌错误思想的公开批判后，王斌又写了两篇反批评。在这两篇反批评文章里，他虽然不得不在口头上承认“团结中西医的政策是绝对正确的”，实际上，却毫不正视自己的错误，毫不检讨自己的错误，反而百般狡辩，企图掩饰自己的错误。王斌分明说过中医是“封建医学”和“封建医”，现在却硬说这是“封建社会时期的医药卫生组织形式与思想作风”的“缩写”；分明是用“只能起到精神上有医生治疗的安慰作用”来否定中医治病的效力，现在居然毫不害羞地说“安慰作用”就是“巴甫洛夫的保护性医疗制度”；至于“停止其（中医）今后招收学徒”，王斌则公然说这“只是在文章上写”
  （要知道，这是身为东北人民政府卫生部长的王斌在东北第四次卫生会议上的报告，是发表在东北卫生部的机关刊物上的作为“行动指南”的“政策性论文”！）“并没有以什么条例规定”。而且王斌还不只掩饰自己的错误，他还在提出了上述的“解释”以后重新肯定了他对中医的估计和处理中医的办法，坚持自己的错误。更严重的是，王斌不仅坚持自己的错误，而且颠倒黑白，对批评他的人进行恶意的攻讦，从而对这次批判运动进行了反击，最后拒绝了党和人民对他的批评。
    在医学和卫生工作中，宣扬各式各样的资产阶级思想，坚持这些错误思想，抗拒和诽谤党和人民的批评，这种恶劣行为同革命者的光荣称号和国家工作人员的光荣身份是绝不相容的。最后，还必须指出，王斌这些资产阶级思想其所以能在医学和卫生工作部门自由传播和散布影响，给人民保健事业带来损失，是和卫生领导部门的某些负责同志的赞同和支持分不开的。这些负责同志之所以会支持和赞同王斌的资产阶级思想，正如卫生部李德全部长在最近的第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言中所指出的那样，是由于他们“对党和政府的方针政策没有认真的研究和贯彻，缺乏政治，而又自以为是，不尊重党中央和毛主席的领导”。即以团结中西医的方针来说，党和毛主席历来就有十分明确的指示。早在抗日战争时期，党和毛主席就提出了这项方针。在一九五○年第一届全国卫生会议期间，毛主席又一次指示：“团结新老中西各部分医药卫生工作人员，组成巩固的统一战线，为开展伟大的人民卫生工作而斗争。”但是，卫生领导部门的某些负责同志并没有充分重视和认真贯彻党的这项方针，反而为资产阶级思想所支配，支持了王斌的错误，奉行了和党的方针正相违背的政策，从而给卫生工作带来很大的损失。
    国务院第二办公室主任林枫同志在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言中，也批评了卫生部某些负责同志在中医问题上“违背党中央和毛主席团结中西医的指示”，批评了他们在“党中央和毛主席一再指出这种方针性的错误后，在实际工作中仍然没有根本的改变”，并且指出了这是一种
  “不问政治，不重视马克思列宁主义的学习……不尊重共产党的领导”的错误，指出了这种非政治倾向正是资产阶级思想的表现。林枫同志特别强调了尊重共产党的领导的必要性，他说：“特别重要的，一切文教工作人员必须认识只有依靠共产党的领导，才能做好工作。由战无不胜的马克思列宁主义所武装起来的中国共产党，不仅能够胜利地领导军事斗争和政治斗争，而且能够胜利地领导国家的经济建设，也完全能够领导和必须领导文教工作。无数事实证明，任何革命工作离开了马克思列宁主义和党的领导，就无法前进。任何认为党不能领导文教工作的想法，都是极端错误的，必须加以纠正。”
    林枫同志这段话，对于卫生部门，对于科学、文艺、教育等一切文教部门，都具有原则性的重要意义。
    我们正在建设社会主义。保证社会主义建设胜利的最重要的一个条件，便是党对一切工作部门的坚强领导和严格监督。敌人破坏我们的社会主义建设的一个重要手段，便是破坏党的领导和监督。我们必须努力反对一切资产阶级思想的侵蚀，努力反对一切脱离党的领导的倾向，在社会主义建设的道路上胜利前进！
