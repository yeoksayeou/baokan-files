　　Reaction to Criticism and Suggestions

　　The Northeast Pharmaceutical General Factory, state-owned, writes: The exposure in the "Letters from Readers" page on July 10th about the fact that our factory allowed a large number of machines to rust in the open air is correct. Due to our factory's lack of spirit of cherishing state property and serious shortcomings in management, we have caused undue losses to the country. The newspaper's criticism made us realize our mistakes. We have instructed the storage department to adjust a simple warehouse to store equipment that is prone to rust. Equipment that cannot be accommodated in the warehouse (such as boilers, etc.) will be coated with red lead anti-rust paint. We are also actively seeking ways to transfer or sell these stockpiled equipment to make them utilized.

　　After the "Letters from Readers" page on June 26th published two letters criticizing the chaotic phenomenon in some units' recruitment of workers, the Mechanical Construction General Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Electrical Industry Administration Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Civil Engineering Construction Company of the Datong Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau, and the First Bridge Repair Team of the Beijing Railway Administration have all sent letters of self-criticism.

　　The Tangshan City Construction Company writes: The criticism of our company on the "Letters from Readers" page on July 17th is correct. We blindly made reservations and recruited personnel, and then casually dismissed them. In addition, some staff members' rude attitude towards workers caused a bad influence. We have decided on measures to improve our work and have requested instructions from higher authorities to give the negligent personnel due punishment.

　　After the "Letters from Readers" page on July 24th published criticism of a construction site of the Third Engineering Company of the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry for not paying attention to safety and sanitation, the Third Engineering Company of the Construction Bureau has sent a letter of self-criticism and has taken some measures to improve the work.

　　After the "Letters from Readers" page on July 10th published the letter "People Stockpiled in Anshan," Anshan Iron and Steel Company and Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company wrote to accept the criticism. In order to properly arrange these surplus personnel, a report has been submitted to the Ministry of Heavy Industry for adjustment.

　　The steelmaking workshop of Chongqing No. 101 Factory writes: The criticism of us throwing away steel blocks on the "Letters from Readers" page on July 17th is in accordance with the facts. We have conducted a serious inspection and will earnestly implement operating procedures in the future, and strive to achieve the task of increasing production and practicing economy in the second half of the year.

　　After the "Letters from Readers" page on June 26th criticized the wrong behavior of the Party Committee Secretary and Manager of the Northeast First Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering for taking advantage of public resources, the Party Committee Secretary conducted a self-criticism at the company's general staff meeting, and all public service personnel in the leadership staff dormitory were removed, and a system for the use of vehicles was stipulated.

　　Kunming Electrical Machinery Factory wrote to accept the criticism from the "Letters from Readers" page on June 26th about some staff members of the factory borrowing public funds for a long time without repayment. Now, the borrowers have formulated a written repayment plan.
