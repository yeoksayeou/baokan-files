The "Health News," the newspaper of the Ministry of Health, has been conducting a critique of the bourgeois ideology represented by Wang Bin, which discriminates against traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), since February 4th. This is a sharp struggle in the field of health work to criticize bourgeois idealistic thought and defend and propagate Marxist-Leninist thought.

Wang Bin published a report in the "Northeast Health" journal, an organ of the former Northeast People's Government, Volume 1, No. 9, 1950, in his capacity as the Minister of Health of the Northeast People's Government at the Fourth Northeast Health Conference: "Certain forms of medical and health organizations and ideological styles are produced on a certain political and economic foundation." In this article, Wang Bin absurdly regarded TCM and its academics as worthless. He believed that TCM academics were "feudal medicine" and should therefore disappear with the demise of feudal society. He completely ignored the role of TCM in protecting people's health. He said: "Judging by the scientific knowledge required for people's health care and treatment, TCM practitioners are unqualified. They can only provide a comforting psychological effect of having a doctor in front of farmers." Wang Bin distorted the Party's policy of uniting Chinese and Western medicine, saying: "From a purely scientific medical point of view, abolishing them is for the benefit of the people," only because "today, New China has just been born and there is not enough time to train a large number of new doctors with scientific standards and experience to replace them," and because people's "cultural level is not high, and they lack scientific knowledge and do not know why TCM should be abolished," so "we cannot adopt the policy of overthrowing them." He proposed various methods for eliminating TCM: "Those who pass short-term training courses will be given medical assistant qualifications, and in the training, they will be enlightened to objectively recognize their past, and they will be stopped from recruiting apprentices in the future." These remarks and propositions can be said to be a concentrated expression of the shameful bourgeois ideology of underestimating, discriminating against, and negating the cultural heritage of the motherland, which is quite prevalent in the health sector.

Wang Bin's article had a considerable harmful impact on health work in Northeast China and some other regions. After publishing this article, the "Northeast Health" magazine wrote a commentary calling on Northeast health workers to "study it in depth." Responsible persons and health workers from some provincial health departments in Northeast China also wrote articles touting it. Until the resolution of the Third National Health Administration Conference in 1954 was conveyed, health departments in some parts of Northeast China even regarded this article as a "guide" for TCM work. Health departments in other places, such as Shanghai, Beijing, and Shanxi, also reprinted Wang Bin's paper and distributed it to health workers for study.

In response to Wang Bin's erroneous thinking, the "Health News" published an article by Zhu Jian on February 4th, titled "Criticize Wang Bin's Bourgeois Ideology of Underestimating and Discriminating Against Traditional Chinese Medicine," which aroused the attention of health workers in various places. Subsequently, more than 40 articles written by responsible persons of health departments, TCM and Western medicine doctors from some provinces and cities, and responses from health workers in various places to this criticism were published continuously. On March 11th, the "Health News" also published an editorial entitled "Actively Participate in the Ideological Struggle to Criticize Wang Bin's Underestimation of Traditional Chinese Medicine," calling on health workers to care about and participate in this struggle. The Ministry of Health issued a notice on March 23rd to health departments in various places to continue to carry out the criticism of Wang Bin's bourgeois ideology of discriminating against and excluding traditional Chinese medicine.

These articles first theoretically refuted Wang Bin's arbitrary statement that TCM and TCM academics are "feudal medicine." It pointed out that medicine belongs to the scope of natural science rather than the superstructure of society. Medical and pharmaceutical scientific knowledge enables humans to recognize and master the objective laws of the occurrence, development, treatment, and prevention of diseases and injuries. It can serve the landlord class and the bourgeoisie, and it can also serve workers and peasants. Therefore, it is wrong for Wang Bin to regard TCM academics as a superstructure and say that TCM is a product of feudal society and should disappear with the demise of feudal society.

These articles also emphasized that Wang Bin obliterated the actual role of TCM in China's health care over thousands of years; slandered TCM as "only" playing the "comforting psychological effect of having a doctor," and attempted to abolish TCM. This is a blind worship of the culture of capitalist countries, a contempt for the cultural heritage of the motherland, and a subjective and sectarian practice of excluding dissidents, which is a bourgeois anti-scientific attitude. TCM has rich experience accumulated by the people of the motherland in the struggle against diseases for thousands of years. Studying and researching TCM is of great significance for improving China's medical level and enriching world medicine. China's new medicine should be a medicine guided by Marxist-Leninist thought, based on Pavlov's physiology, and containing all the valuable content of TCM and Western medicine. As the editorial of the "People's Daily" on October 20, 1954, "Implement the Correct Policy Towards Traditional Chinese Medicine" said: We should gradually create such a modernized medicine, which should reflect the characteristics of China's geography and climate, reflect the characteristics of the application of China's special medicinal materials, and reflect the characteristics of the life and labor of all ethnic groups in China.

These articles also focused on criticizing Wang Bin's mistakes in the TCM issue that violated the Party's policy. Everyone clearly pointed out that uniting TCM is the Party's established policy, and its purpose is to accept the medical heritage of the motherland, give play to the enthusiasm of TCM practitioners, and make them serve the people's health care cause. This policy is formulated based on the actual needs of China's health care cause and the broad masses of people, and based on a correct assessment of the scientific value of TCM. It is by no means an expedient measure taken simply because there is no one to "replace" them temporarily, as Wang Bin said. During the criticism, some comrades exposed the damage that Wang Bin's thinking of excluding TCM brought to TCM work.

The articles published in the "Health News" also pointed out Wang Bin's mistake of separating TCM and Chinese herbal medicine. It is believed that it is a wrong method to study Chinese herbal medicine in isolation and one-sidedly, setting aside the rich experience accumulated by TCM practitioners for thousands of years. The correct method should be to pay attention to the experience and characteristics of TCM medication, obtain the guidance and assistance of TCM practitioners, and conduct research in combination with the clinical practice of TCM and Western medicine.

The "Health News"'s criticism of Wang Bin's erroneous thinking has aroused the attention of cultural and scientific circles and all aspects of society, especially educated the broad masses of health workers, made them deeply aware of the importance of criticizing bourgeois ideology, studying Marxism-Leninism and the Party's policies, and encouraged their enthusiasm for learning. By the end of July, the "Health News" had received more than 600 articles about participating in this criticism of Wang Bin's thinking, exposing similar erroneous thinking, actively studying TCM policies, and explaining the importance of studying TCM, as well as many readers' letters. "Chinese Medical Journal," "Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine," "Shanghai Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine" and other school journals such as Harbin Medical University have reprinted some of the papers published in the "Health News."

"Science Bulletin," "Literature, History and Philosophy," "Intermediate Medical Journal" and other school journals such as China Medical University have also published articles criticizing Wang Bin's thinking. Health departments in Jiangsu, Sichuan, Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Shandong, Shanxi, Beijing, Wuhan, Shanghai, Chongqing, Nanchang and other provinces and cities have further launched the study of TCM policies as a result. The General Association of the Chinese Medical Association and the branches in Shanghai, Chongqing, Chengdu, Changchun, Xi'an, Nanning and other places have organized members to conduct symposiums and discussions. Many medical and health workers have improved their understanding through this ideological criticism; some have also begun to connect with work, examine their thinking, and improve their work. For example, Chen Rutang, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Health Department, said: In the past, the Guangdong Provincial Health Administration leadership did not seriously implement the Party's TCM policy, and even took restrictive and exclusionary attitudes towards TCM in many aspects. Hu Maolian, Dean of the Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat College of Shanghai First Medical College, said: "After reading the article criticizing Wang Bin, I realized that the idea of ​​underestimating and discriminating against TCM is a bourgeois idea." He expressed that he would eliminate this bourgeois idealistic thinking and complete the task assigned by the Party - Western medicine learning TCM, promoting the medical heritage of the motherland, and doing a good job in teaching.

The "Health News"'s ideological criticism has encouraged TCM practitioners and improved their enthusiasm. Yuan Pu, a TCM doctor in Shenyang, said: The "Health News" has said everything we have wanted to say for several years. They expressed that under the leadership of the Party and the government, they will work hard to study Marxism-Leninism, modern scientific knowledge, and advanced Soviet medicine, and dedicate their greatest efforts to promoting the medical heritage of the motherland and for the people's health care cause.

After the "Health News" launched the criticism of Wang Bin's erroneous thinking, Wang Bin wrote two articles entitled "Must Use Materialist Thought to Criticize the Idealistic Bourgeois Thought of Misrepresenting and Maliciously Slandering Represented by Zhu Jian" and "My Understanding of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Problem," trying his best to cover up and deny his mistakes in thinking and work, and launched a counterattack against the criticism of him in the "Health News." In these two articles, although he had to admit on the surface that "the Party's 'uniting Chinese and Western medicine' policy is absolutely correct, and Chinese and Western medicine are important forces in the cause of people's health care in China today," he still deliberately exaggerated the influence of feudal social consciousness on TCM academics, deliberately belittled the efficacy of TCM in treating diseases, and in essence, he still held a contemptuous attitude towards TCM and resisted the Party's policy of uniting TCM. Moreover, in order to deny his mistakes, Wang Bin spared no effort to deny them, ridiculously claiming that his so-called "feudal medicine" was a "shortened form" of the sentence "feudal society and the forms of medical and health organizations and ideological styles during feudal society"! He even distorted Pavlov's theory to defend himself, and insisted that his fallacy that TCM can only play a "comforting psychological effect of having a doctor," which he used to deny the efficacy of TCM in treating diseases, was in line with the "protective medical system." He also said that some of his propositions "were only written in the article and were not stipulated in any regulations," attempting to shirk his responsibility with this ridiculous excuse. Not only that, he also distorted the original intention of the critics and maliciously attacked the critics for "catering" to the Party's policy of "uniting Chinese and Western medicine" with a "bourgeois mentality." This shows that Wang Bin has completely lost the position of a communist party member and adopted a wrong attitude towards criticism and self-criticism, indicating that he still resolutely resists the Party's policy of "uniting Chinese and Western medicine."

The "Health News" is now conducting an in-depth criticism of Wang Bin's erroneous thinking.

　　健康报批判王斌在中医问题上的错误思想
　　朱莹
    卫生部机关报“健康报”，自二月四日开始，对以王斌为代表的歧视中医的资产阶级思想，展开了批判。这是在卫生工作中批判资产阶级唯心主义思想、捍卫和宣传马克思列宁主义思想的一场尖锐的斗争。
    王斌曾在前东北人民政府机关刊物“东北卫生”一九五○年第一卷第九期上发表了他当时以东北人民政府卫生部部长的名义在东北第四次卫生会议上所作的报告：“在一定的政治经济基础上产生一定的医药卫生组织形式与思想作风”。在这篇文章里，王斌荒谬地把中医和中医学术看得一钱不值。他认为，中医学术是“封建医学”，因而应当随着封建社会的消灭而消灭，他完全抹杀中医在保护人民健康方面的作用。他说：中医“以人民保健与治疗所需要的科学知识来衡量，他们都是不合格的，他们只能在农民面前起到精神上有医生治疗的安慰作用”，王斌歪曲党的团结中西医的政策说：“从单纯科学医学来看，取消他们是为了人民”，只是因为“今天新中国诞生不久，尚来不及培养大批有科学水平与经验的新医生去置换”，而且人民“文化程度不高，缺乏科学知识，不知为什么要取缔中医”，“取缔旧医会造成人民对我们的误会”，所以才“不能采取打倒他们的方针”。他提出了各种消灭中医的方法：“开短期训练班经训练合格者给予医助资格，并在训练中启发他们客观的来认识他们的过去，停止其今后招收学徒。”这些言论和主张，可以说是卫生部门中相当普遍地存在着的轻视、歧视和否定祖国文化遗产的可耻的资产阶级思想的集中的表现。
    王斌这篇文章对东北和其他某些地区的卫生工作曾发生相当大的有害的影响。“东北卫生”杂志在发表这篇文章后，又写评论号召东北卫生工作者“深入学习”它。东北地区某些省卫生厅的负责人和卫生工作者也写文章吹嘘它。直到一九五四年第三届全国卫生行政会议的决议传达下去之前，东北某些地方的卫生部门还曾把这篇文章当作中医工作的“指南”。其他如上海、北京、山西等地卫生部门，也曾翻印王斌的这篇论文，发给卫生工作人员学习。
    针对王斌的这种错误思想，“健康报”在今年二月四日发表了朱健写的题为“批判王斌轻视歧视中医的资产阶级思想”的文章，引起了各地卫生工作者的重视。接着又连续发表了一些省市卫生部门负责人、中西医师等撰写的四十多篇文章，和各地卫生工作者对这一批判的反应。三月十一日，“健康报”并以“积极参加批判王斌轻视中医的思想斗争”为题发表了社论，号召卫生工作者关心并参加这个斗争。卫生部并于三月二十三日通知各地卫生部门继续开展对王斌歧视、排斥中医的资产阶级思想的批判。
    这些文章，首先从理论上驳斥了王斌武断地把中医和中医学术称为“封建医”和“封建医学”的说法。指出：医学属于自然科学范围而不是社会的上层建筑。医药科学知识使人类能认识和掌握疾病创伤的发生、发展、治疗、预防的客观规律。它可以为地主阶级和资产阶级服务，同样可以为工人、农民服务。因此，像王斌那样，把中医学术当作上层建筑，说中医是封建社会的产物，应随着封建社会的消灭而消灭的说法是错误的。
    这些文章又强调指出，王斌抹煞了中医中药几千年来在我国保健事业上的实际作用；诬蔑中医“只能”起到“精神上有医生治疗的安慰作用”，企图取消中医，这是盲目崇拜资本主义国家的文化、鄙视祖国文化遗产、排除异己的主观主义和宗派主义的作法，是资产阶级反科学的态度。中医有着数千年来祖国人民在同疾病斗争中积累起来的丰富经验，学习和研究中医对于提高我国医学水平和丰富世界医学都是具有重大的意义的。我国的新医学应当是在马克思列宁主义思想指导下，以巴甫洛夫生理学说为基础，包含所有中医学和西洋医学中的有价值的内容的医学。正如一九五四年十月二十日
  “人民日报”社论“贯彻对待中医的正确政策”中所说的：我们应该逐渐创立这样的现代化医学，它应该反映出中国的地理、气候的特点，反映出中国特产的药材应用的特点，反映出中国各族人民的生活和劳动的特点。
    这些文章对王斌在中医问题方面所犯的违背党的政策的错误，也着重地进行了批判。大家都明确地指出：团结中医，是党的既定政策，它的目的在于接受祖国的医学遗产，发挥中医的积极性，使他们为人民保健事业服务。这一政策是根据我国卫生事业和广大人民的实际需要、根据对于中医的科学价值的正确估计而制定的，决不是如王斌所说只是因为暂时没有人“置换”而采取的权宜办法。在批判中间，有的同志揭发了王斌排斥中医的思想给中医工作带来的损害。
    “健康报”发表的文章也指出了王斌把中医中药分割开来的错误。认为撇开中医千百年来积累起来的丰富的经验，孤立地、片面地去研究中药是错误的方法。正确的方法应该是重视中医用药的经验和特点，取得中医的指导和协助，结合中西医的临床实践来进行研究。
    “健康报”对王斌错误思想的批判，引起了文化科学界和社会各方面的注意，特别是教育了广大的卫生工作者，使他们深刻认识到批判资产阶级思想、学习马克思列宁主义和党的政策的重要性，并鼓舞了他们的学习热情。到七月底为止，“健康报”已收到了关于参加这次批判王斌思想、揭发类似的错误思想、积极学习中医政策、说明学习中医的重要性的来稿六百多件以及许多读者来信。“中华医学杂志”、“中医杂志”、“上海中医药”以及哈尔滨医科大学等校刊都转载了“健康报”发表的某些论文。
  “科学通报”、“文史哲”、“中级医刊”和中国医科大学等校刊也都发表了批判王斌思想的文章。江苏、四川、甘肃、广东、广西、山东、山西和北京、武汉、上海、重庆、南昌等省市卫生部门，都因此而进一步展开了中医政策的学习。中华医学会总会和上海、重庆、成都、长春、西安、南宁等地分会，都组织会员进行了座谈讨论。很多医药卫生工作者通过这个思想批判提高了自己的认识；有的人并已开始联系工作，检查思想，改进工作。如广东省卫生厅长陈汝棠说：广东省卫生行政领导方面过去没有认真地贯彻党的中医政策，甚至在许多方面对中医采取了限制和排挤的态度。上海第一医学院眼耳鼻喉科学院院长胡懋廉说：“看过批判王斌的文章以后，我认识到轻视、歧视中医的思想是一种资产阶级思想。”他表示要清除这种资产阶级唯心主义的思想，完成党交给的任务——西医学习中医，发扬祖国医学遗产，搞好教学工作。
    “健康报”的这一思想批判，鼓舞了中医，提高了他们的积极性。沈阳市中医师袁璞说：“健康报”把我们几年来要说的话都给说出来了。他们表示要在党和政府的领导下，努力学习马克思列宁主义，努力学习现代科学知识和苏联先进医学，为发扬祖国医学遗产、为人民保健事业而献出最大的力量。
    在“健康报”展开了对王斌错误思想的批判后，王斌写了题为“必须以唯物主义思想来批判以朱健为代表的断章取义恶意毁谤的唯心主义的资产阶级思想”和“我对中医问题的认识”两篇文章，极力掩盖和抵赖自己在思想上和工作上的错误，并对“健康报”上对他的批判进行反攻。在这两篇文章中，他虽然不得不在表面上承认了“党的‘团结中西医’的政策是绝对正确的，中西医是今天中国人民保健事业中的重要力量”，但是，仍然故意夸大封建社会意识对中医学术的影响，故意贬低中医治病的效力，实质上仍然是对中医抱着轻视的态度，抗拒党的团结中医的政策。而且王斌为了抵赖自己的错误，不惜百般抵赖，诡称他所谓的“封建医”是
  “封建社会与封建社会时期的医药卫生组织形式和思想作风”这样一句话的“缩写”！甚至曲解巴甫洛夫学说来为自己辩护，硬把他用来否定中医治病效力的所谓中医只能起“精神上有医生治疗的安慰作用”的谬论说成是符合于“保护性医疗制度”。他又说，他的某些主张，“只是在文章上写，并没有以什么条例来规定”，企图用这种可笑的借口来推卸他应负的责任。不但这样，他还歪曲批评者的原意，恶意地攻击批评者是以“资产阶级心理”来
  “迎合”党“团结中西医”的政策。这表示王斌已经完全丧失了共产党员的立场，采取错误的态度来对待批评和自我批评，表示他仍然坚决抗拒党“团结中西医”的政策。
      “健康报”现在正在深入展开对王斌的错误思想的批判。
