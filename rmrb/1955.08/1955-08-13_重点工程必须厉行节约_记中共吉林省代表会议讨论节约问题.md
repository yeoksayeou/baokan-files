Key Projects Must Practice Strict Economy
    — A Record of the Discussion of Economy at the CPC Jilin Provincial Representative Conference
    By Our Reporter Lin Li

    From June 10th to 26th, the CPC Jilin Provincial Committee held its Third Representative Conference. During the conference, the representatives studied the documents of the Party's National Representative Conference, listened to and discussed the report of the CPC Jilin Provincial Committee, adopted resolutions endorsing the various reports and resolutions of the Party's National Representative Conference; and finally, elected the Supervisory Committee of the Communist Party of China, Jilin Province.

    While addressing the major issues above, the representatives from the basic construction front, in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, examined the key projects in Jilin Province, concerning the central government's instructions on practicing comprehensive economy and opposing all waste.

    The representatives pointed out that key projects in Jilin Province are generally in the construction phase and are a considerable time away from starting production. In the construction phase, the engineering plans for various periods have generally been completed, and they can be put into production within the time specified by the state, which is a remarkable achievement. However, in the process of completing the plans, some units have failed to implement the principles of hard work, plain living, and strict economy, resulting in serious, even appalling waste.

    A prominent manifestation of serious waste is the excessive, premature, and overly elaborate construction of non-productive buildings. The First Automobile Works is the most typical example of this.

    The construction of the factory buildings of the First Automobile Works has not yet been completed, and the time for the official production of automobiles has not yet been finally determined, but they hastily built a "Car City." In this "city," more than 200,000 square meters of luxurious workers' dormitories were built in 1954 alone. Are these dormitories meant for the basic construction workers? Most of the basic construction workers have not moved in. Are they meant for the production workers? Most of the production workers have not yet arrived at the factory. On the other hand, these dormitories are excessively decorated with overhanging eaves, corner towers, relief patterns, and quaint drooping flower canopies. The interior equipment is also excessively elaborate, with each household having shower facilities. These buildings, on the one hand, waste a large amount of state property, and on the other hand, are not suitable for the current needs of the workers. The workers sighed at the dormitories and said, "The state can afford to build them, but we cannot afford to live in them." While building these dormitories, they also built a magnificent cadre guesthouse... In this way, this modern automobile manufacturing plant has been embellished into a palace. People have composed a poem, saying: "When you come to the automobile factory, first worship the Dragon King Temple, then see the Wenchang Pavilion, and then meet the Land God Shrine." This is the most incisive satire of revivalism.

    Like the First Automobile Works, which disregards the current living standards of the Chinese people and the difficulties of the state in accumulating funds, blindly pursuing luxury, was criticized by the representatives as having the style of "young masters." This style is also seriously present in other key construction projects in Jilin Province. A factory in Jilin City built a clinic twice as large as the actual immediate need a year or two before it was due to start production. It also purchased a large number of high-end medical equipment worth more than 77,000 yuan, some of which are still stockpiled and cannot be installed, and some of which are installed but no one knows how to use.

    Another manifestation of serious waste is the bloated organization, overstaffing, and a large amount of idle work during construction. The Directly Subordinate Engineering Company of the Construction Engineering Department, which is undertaking the construction of the First Automobile Works, has five thousand more people than actually needed. Last year, the company spent 450,000 yuan on downtime, idle work, and overtime. In the first quarter of this year, the actual number of workers on the payroll was 37.6 percent more than the planned number. In the second half of last year alone, the installation system idled more than 335,000 workdays, spending 670,000 yuan on idle work. However, even now, the leaders of the automobile factory cannot figure out how many people are superfluous. They only know that there is an administrative office with more than a thousand people and five levels of organization, which is called "the world's first office." In this office, it has become very common for staff members to read novels and play cards during office hours, and some idle people simply close the door to sleep, cause ideological problems, or even go out to catch rabbits. The situation of overstaffing is not an isolated phenomenon like in the First Automobile Works; a factory in Jilin City that originally only needed 1,400 people now has as many as 1,800 people.

    The backlog of building materials and machinery and equipment is even more serious than the waste of manpower. A factory in Jilin City stockpiled materials worth more than 3.7 million yuan and machinery and equipment worth more than 130,000 yuan in the past year alone. The steel rails and steel purchased for the Xi'an vertical shaft were also more than 200 tons more than actually needed. The First Automobile Works has enough stockpiled machinery and equipment to open a machine factory with several thousand people. According to the preliminary inventory of the automobile factory, they have successively stockpiled construction equipment worth 7,342,000 yuan and machinery and equipment (1,526 units/pieces) worth more than 7,400,000 yuan. The leading staff of these units are not distressed by such serious stockpiling and waste, but instead produce all kinds of strange theories, saying things like "matter cannot be destroyed," "if we don't use it this year, we'll use it next year," "if one factory doesn't use it, another factory will use it," and "the meat rots in the pot, it will always be useful in the future."

    While exposing these wasteful phenomena, the representatives also criticized the erroneous thinking and viewpoints of some basic construction leaders. The representatives believe that the most common and most harmful ideas among basic construction personnel are the so-called "large-scale everywhere," "modernization in everything," and "don't ask anyone for anything."

    Under the guidance of this kind of thinking, specific demands such as "factories should be large, machines should be numerous, and welfare should be good" have been put forward. There is also such a factory, which, for the sake of "large scale," for the sake of "modernization," and in order to make non-productive buildings "compatible" with the new type of enterprises equipped with advanced Soviet technology, designed an "automated" dining hall. According to the design, the dishes and rice made on the first floor could be sent to the second floor by an automatic elevator. Although the automated dining hall was not built because of "fear of leadership criticism," it concretely and profoundly exposed the erroneous thinking of certain enterprise leaders. Under the domination of this kind of "large-scale" and "modernization" thinking, the leaders in charge of civil engineering on the construction site of this factory even replaced the abacuses of the accounting and statistical personnel with slide rules. When people suggested that slide rules were several times more expensive than abacuses, the leaders dismissed the person who raised the objection as "ideologically backward."

    Under the guidance of the idea of "don't ask anyone for anything," many factories are unwilling to cooperate with other factories and excessively demand the construction of auxiliary production workshops; many factories have productive basic construction and also want non-productive welfare construction; some factories, even though they are still far from starting production and the formal production workers have not yet arrived at the factory, build hospitals, schools, nurseries, cooperatives, etc. early on. As a result, the unreasonable phenomenon of "hospitals built without patients, nurseries built without children to care for, and automobile warehouses built without cars to put in them" has arisen. The representatives pointed out that the so-called "don't ask anyone for anything" thinking is essentially an attempt to build their own enterprises into "independent kingdoms," which is an extremely wrong idea.

    When criticizing the erroneous thinking of blindly demanding "large scale" and "modernization," the representatives pointed out that the source of this erroneous thinking is, on the one hand, that some comrades have been overwhelmed by victory, and they ignore the current economic difficulties of the country and do not see the arduousness of building a socialist society; when learning advanced Soviet technology, they also demand that welfare facilities be on par with Soviet enterprises. They do not understand that the welfare facilities in Soviet enterprises are the result of more than 30 years of construction in the Soviet Union. On the other hand, some comrades have been adversely affected by the bourgeois ideas spread by the Gao Gang anti-Party clique. They imitate the lifestyle of the bourgeoisie and pursue the so-called "pleasures of life" of the bourgeoisie. They attempt to establish a garden in the process of national economic construction to satisfy their personal desires for enjoyment. Therefore, they have also created many strange theories, saying that advanced production equipment must be matched with advanced welfare facilities; new socialist enterprises must be accompanied by new living environments. The influence of this erroneous thinking is quite extensive and has brought huge losses to the country. The representatives pointed out that in future basic construction, eliminating the adverse effects of this bourgeois thinking is one of the issues that Party committees at all levels must pay close attention to.

    Through the criticism of erroneous thinking, the representatives' minds have become clearer and their eyes have become brighter. While exposing wasteful phenomena and criticizing erroneous thinking, they have more deeply understood the important significance of the central government's instructions. Therefore, at the increase production and practice economy symposium outside the conference, they examined the wasteful situations in their units and proposed their units' economy methods and economy figures. According to preliminary statistics, key projects, urban construction, and local projects in the province can save the country 100 million yuan in investment in future construction.

    Judging from the economy methods and economy figures formulated by various units, the flexibility of basic construction investment is very large, and the scope and possibilities of economy are very broad. Even projects that are mostly completed or are in the final stages have great potential. A factory in Jilin City has completed more than 64% of its total workload. According to economic indicators, only 11.1 million yuan of work remains, but after the deliberations and discussions during the conference and the preliminary calculations of the representatives, more than 3.2 million yuan can be saved. The First Automobile Works has initially reduced more than 20 non-productive buildings such as office buildings and 100-vehicle warehouses, saving the country 16 million yuan in investment.

    When discussing economy methods, the representatives unanimously agreed that cooperation between factories and cooperation between state-owned and local state-owned enterprises are one of the ways to save state investment. There are three factories in a row on a certain construction site, and because the designs belong to three different units, there are three similar machine repair workshops. The representatives suggested cutting one or two of them. Such a reduction is completely reasonable, saving the country investment without affecting future production. A local state-owned industrial enterprise in Jilin originally had a woodworking factory with production equipment greater than the market demand. However, in the design of a certain factory, there was another sawmill workshop of considerable size. The representatives believed that cutting this sawmill workshop could not only reduce state investment but also unleash the potential power of local state-owned enterprises.

    In the process of discussing economy methods, the representatives once again experienced the superiority and advancement of Soviet designs. The representatives from Jilin City mentioned that Soviet designers fully paid attention to the spirit of economy when designing factories, especially in the selection of building materials, all following the principle of "local materials." In a certain project construction there, a Soviet expert stipulated in the design that 5,000 tons of steel pipes should be used. However, this kind of steel pipe was very expensive and difficult to buy. The technical personnel wanted to replace it with iron pipes, but they were afraid of affecting the quality of the project. Later, they discussed with the Soviet experts and asked why the original design stipulated the use of steel pipes. When the Soviet expert learned that the price of Chinese iron pipes was cheaper than steel pipes, he immediately agreed to the suggestion of the Chinese technical personnel. The Soviet expert said that the original design stipulated the use of steel pipes because the output of steel pipes in the Soviet Union was large and even cheaper than iron pipes. From this incident, they found a series of economy methods and actively found some substitute materials to replace some more expensive materials.

    The discussion of economy issues is one of the achievements of this Jilin Provincial Party Representative Conference. However, the achievement of this achievement has gone through a struggle. Before the Party Representative Conference was held, the responsible comrades of the Jilin Provincial Party Committee went to various key projects to check work and study problems. Especially on the issue of economy, at the beginning, the ideological resistance of enterprise leaders was very large. For example, when some inspection personnel went to a factory to discuss economy issues with the factory director, the factory director first asked in reply: "Comrade, do you understand technology? What did you study in the past?" Then he said: "Economy? What is there to economize on?" When the inspection personnel specifically pointed out that their dormitories were built too much and too well, the factory director still replied: "This is not my fault, the construction of the houses was approved by the Municipal Party Committee." The Jilin Provincial Party Committee did not compromise with this resistance, and the Provincial Party Committee Inspection Team personally went to the factory to check work, mobilized the masses, and explained the great significance of economy for socialist economic construction. As a result, the factory proposed many economy methods. There was also a factory. When the discussion of economy issues began, the factory director always said that the project had entered the final stages and there was no big "profit." Until the end, he reluctantly set a figure of 380,000 yuan for economy. However, after the enlightenment and education of the Party Representative Conference, the factory director withdrew his economy figure of 380,000 yuan and proposed an economy figure of 3.2 million yuan. He repeatedly stated that this figure was only worked out by a few representatives. After mobilizing the masses upon returning to the factory, adding in the economy in civil engineering, it would definitely be larger than the figure of 3.2 million yuan. The basic construction units in Jilin Province made a solemn guarantee on the issue of economy at the Party Representative Conference. They will definitely be able to make greater achievements in their practical work.

    重点工程必须厉行节约
    ——记中共吉林省代表会议讨论节约问题
    本报记者　林里
    六月十日到二十六日，中共吉林省委召开了第三次代表会议。会议期间，代表们学习了党的全国代表会议的文件，听取和讨论了中共吉林省委员会的报告，通过了拥护党的全国代表会议的各项报告和决议的决议；最后，选出了中国共产党吉林省监察委员会。
    在解决上述重大问题的同时，来自基本建设岗位的代表，曾就中央发出的厉行全面节约、反对一切浪费的指示，以批评和自我批评的精神，对吉林省的重点工程进行了检查。
    代表们指出，吉林省的重点工程，一般都处于建设阶段，距离开工生产还有一个相当时期。在建设阶段，一般都完成了各个时期的工程计划，并且可以在国家指定的时间内投入生产，成绩是显著的。但在完成计划的过程当中，有些单位没有贯彻艰苦朴素、厉行节约的原则，造成了严重的、甚至是惊人的浪费。
    严重浪费的突出表现，是非生产性的建筑过多、过早和过好。在这方面，最典型的例子是第一汽车制造厂。
    第一汽车制造厂的厂房建筑任务还没有完成，正式生产汽车的时间也还没有最后确定，但他们却急急忙忙地建筑起了一座“汽车城”。在这座“城”里，单是一九五四年内，就盖起了二十多万平方公尺豪华的工人宿舍。这些宿舍说是为基本建设工人住吧？大部分基本建设工人没住上；说是为生产工人住宿吧？大部分生产工人还没有到厂。另方面，这些宿舍又过多地装饰了飞檐角楼，浮雕团花，以及古色古香的垂花雨篷，室内设备也过分讲究，每户都有淋浴等设备。这些建筑，一方面浪费了国家的大批财产，另方面又不适合于工人的当前需要。工人们指着宿舍叹息地说：“国家盖得起，我们住不起。”在建筑这些宿舍的同时，他们还建筑了富丽堂皇的干部招待所，……。这样一来，这座现代化的汽车制造厂，就点缀成了宫殿庙堂。人们编了一首诗，说：“来到汽车厂，先拜龙王庙，后看文昌阁，再见土地堂。”就是对于复古主义的最尖锐讽刺。
    像第一汽车制造厂这样不顾我国人民当前生活水平、不考虑国家积累资金的困难，盲目地追求豪华，被代表们斥为“阔少爷”作风。这种作风，在吉林省的其他重点建设中，也同样严重地存在着。吉林市有一个工厂，早在开工生产的一两年前，就盖起了一座比眼前实际需要大两倍的卫生所；并且购置了价值七万七千多元的大批高级医疗器材，这些医疗器材，有的积压至今不能安装，有的安装起来又没有人会使用。
    严重浪费的另一个表现，是机构臃肿，人浮于事，以及施工当中的大量窝工。承建第一汽车制造厂工程的建筑工程部直属工程公司，现有人员竟比实际需要多了五千多名。去年，这个公司支出的停工、窝工和加班加点费，就有四十五万元。今年第一季度，工人的实际在册人数，要比计划需要数多了百分之三十七点六。光是去年下半年内，安装系统就窝工三十三万五千多个工日，支出窝工费用六十七万元。然而直到现在，汽车厂的领导人员，谁也弄不清究竟多了多少人。他们只知道下面有一个千人以上的、五级机构的行政处，被人们叫做“天下第一处”。在这个处里，工作人员在办公时间看小说，打扑克成了极平常的事，还有一些无所事事的人，就干脆关门睡觉、闹思想问题，甚至出外捉兔子。像汽车厂这样人浮于事的并不是个别的现象；吉林市有一个本来只需要一千四百人的工厂，现在却有一千八百人之多。
    建筑材料和机器设备的积压，比人力的浪费更为严重。吉林市有一个工厂，仅在去年一年内，就积压了价值三百七十多万元的材料和价值十三万元以上的机器设备。西安竖井购置的钢轨和钢材，也比实际需要多了二百多吨。第一汽车制造厂单是积压的机器设备，就足够开办一个几千人的机器厂。根据汽车厂的初步清点，他们先后积压了价值七百三十四万二千元的建筑器材，和价值七百四十多万元的机器设备（一千五百二十六台、件）。这些单位的领导工作人员对于这样严重的积压浪费，却并不痛心，反而制造出种种怪论，说什么“物质不灭”，“今年不用明年用”，“一厂不用二厂用”，“肉烂在锅里，将来总有用”。
    代表们在揭发这些浪费现象的同时，也批判了某些基本建设领导工作人员的错误思想和错误观点。代表们认为：基本建设人员当中最普遍、也最有害的思想，是所谓“处处大规模”、“样样近代化”和“万事不求人”。
    在这样的思想指导下，就提出了所谓“工厂要大，机器要多，福利要好”的具体要求。还有这样一个工厂，他们为了“大规模”，为了“近代化”，为了使非生产性的建筑，跟苏联先进技术装备起来的新型企业“相适应”，就设计了一个“自动化”食堂。按照设计，可以把一楼做好的菜饭，用自动升降机送到二楼。自动化食堂虽因“怕领导批评”没有建成，但它却具体而深刻地暴露了某些企业领导人员的错误思想。在这种“大规模”“近代化”的思想支配下，这个工厂工地上土木建筑方面的领导人员，竟把会计人员和统计人员的算盘，一律换成计算尺。当人们提出计算尺比算盘价格要高好几倍的意见时，领导人员却不以为然地说提意见的人“思想落后”。
    在“万事不求人”的思想指导下，许多工厂不愿意和别的工厂协作，过多地要求建设辅助生产车间；许多工厂有了生产性的基本建设，还要非生产性的福利建设，有些工厂尽管他们离开工生产的时间还很远，正式的生产工人还没有到厂，可就早早地盖起了一座又一座的医院、学校、托儿所、合作社等等。结果，就产生了“医院盖起无病员，托儿所盖起无儿托，汽车仓库盖起无车放”的不合理现象。代表们指出，所谓“万事不求人”的思想，实质上是想把自己的企业建设成为“独立王国”，这是极端错误的思想。
    代表们在批判盲目地要求“大规模”和“近代化”的错误思想时指出，这种错误思想的来源，一方面是有些同志被胜利冲昏了头脑，他们不顾国家当前的经济困难，看不见建设社会主义社会的艰苦性；在学习苏联先进技术时，也要求福利设备方面和苏联的企业看齐，他们不懂得，苏联企业中的福利设备，是苏联三十多年建设的成果。另一方面，是有些同志受了高岗反党宗派散布的资产阶级思想的恶劣影响，他们模仿资产阶级的生活方式，追求资产阶级的所谓“生活乐趣”。他们企图在国家经济建设过程中，建立起满足他们个人享受欲望的园地。因而他们又制造了许多奇奇怪怪的理论，说什么先进的生产设备，就一定要有先进的福利设施相适应；新型的社会主义企业，就一定要有新型的生活环境来陪衬。这种错误思想的影响是相当广泛的，给国家带来的损失是巨大的。代表们指出，在今后的基本建设中，肃清这种资产阶级思想的恶劣影响，是各级党委必须严加注意的问题之一。
    通过对于错误思想的批判，各位代表的头脑清醒了，眼睛更亮了。他们在揭发浪费现象、批判错误思想的同时，更深刻地领会到中央指示的重要意义，因而在会议外的增产节约座谈会上，检查了本单位浪费情况并提出了本单位的节约办法和节约数字。据初步统计，全省重点工程、城市建设、地方工程，在今后的建设中就能为国家节省一亿元的投资。
    从各单位所制定的节约办法和节约数字来看，基本建设投资的伸缩性很大，节约的范围和可能性很广。就是已经大部完工，或进入收尾阶段的工程，也有很大的潜力。吉林市有一个工厂，它的全部工程量已经完成了百分之六十四以上，按经济指标来算，只剩下了一千一百几十万元的工作量，但经过了会议期间的酝酿讨论和代表们的初步计算，就可以节约三百二十多万元。第一汽车制造厂初步削减了办公大楼、百辆车仓库等二十几项非生产性建筑，就给国家节省了一千六百万元的投资。
    在讨论节约办法时，代表们一致认为厂和厂之间的协作，国营和地方国营企业之间的协作，是节省国家投资的方法之一。某建筑工地上一连片有三个工厂，因为设计属于三个不同的单位，结果就有三个相似的机修车间。代表们建议削掉一个或二个。这样的削减是完全合理的，既给国家节省了投资，又不影响未来的生产。吉林地方国营工业中原有一个木工厂，生产设备大于市场需要。但某一个工厂设计中，却又有一个规模不小的锯木车间。代表们认为削掉这个锯木车间，既可以减少国家投资，又可以发挥地方国营企业的潜在力量。
    代表们在讨论节约办法的过程中，又一次体会到苏联设计的优越性和先进性。吉林市的代表们谈到，苏联的设计人员，在设计工厂之初，就充分注意了节约精神，特别是在建筑材料的选择上，全都遵循着“就地取材”的原则。他们那里的某项工程建设上，苏联专家在设计中规定要用钢管五千吨。但这种钢管一来很贵，二来又不好买。技术人员们想用铁管来代替，但又怕影响工程质量。后来，他们跟苏联专家商量，并询问原设计规定用钢管的原因。当苏联专家知道中国的铁管价格比钢管便宜的时候，立刻同意了中国技术人员的建议。苏联专家说，原设计上规定用钢管是因为苏联的钢管产量大比铁管还便宜。从这件事开始，他们就找到了一连串的节约办法，主动地找到了一些代用材料，来代替某些价格较贵的材料。
    对于节约问题的讨论，是这次吉林省党的代表会议的成绩之一。但是这个成绩的取得，是经过了一番斗争的。在代表会议开会以前，吉林省委的负责同志，曾到各个重点工程去检查工作和研究问题。特别是在节约问题上，开始，企业领导人员的思想抵触很大。比如，当有些检查工作的人员到某工厂同厂长谈节约问题时，某厂长首先反问说：“同志，你懂不懂技术？过去是学什么的？”接着又说：“节约？有什么可节约的呢？”当检查人员具体指出他们的宿舍盖的过多和过好的时候，厂长依然回答说：“这不是我的过错，盖房子是市委批准的。”吉林省委并没有同这种抗拒情绪妥协，省委检查组曾经亲自去这个厂检查工作，发动群众，说明节约对于社会主义经济建设的重大意义，结果，这个工厂就提出了许多节约的办法。还有一个工厂，开始讨论节约问题时，厂长始终是说工程已经进入收尾阶段，没有什么大“油水”，直到最后，才勉强定了个节约三十八万元的数字。但是经过党的代表会议启发教育，厂长收回了他那三十八万元的节约数字，提出了节约三百二十万元的数字，他还一再声明，这个数字只是几个代表研究出来的，回厂发动群众以后，加上土木建筑工程方面的节约，一定会比三百二十万元的数字要大。吉林省各基本建设单位在党的代表会议上提出了他们在节约问题上的庄严保证，他们在实际工作中一定能够作出更大的成绩。
