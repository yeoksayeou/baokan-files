　  Anhui Province is actively developing the production of eri silk cocoons. This year, 880 boxes of silkworm eggs have been distributed in the eri silkworm producing areas of Bo County, Taihe and other eight counties. Currently, fresh cocoons are about to be on the market in various places. The Heping and Xinlian agricultural producers' cooperatives in Dangtu County raised 100 boxes in the first season, with an average yield of 35 to 40 jin of fresh cocoons per box.

    Eri silkworms were introduced from abroad and test-reared by the Chinese Academy of Sciences three years ago. Its vitality is stronger than other silkworm species, and it can adapt to rainy, humid, and hot climates, and is easy to raise and grow. At the same time, the castor leaves eaten by eri silkworms are annual plants and can be planted in large quantities on idle land such as sandy land and mountain land. These favorable conditions have promoted the development of eri silkworms.

　  安徽积极发展蓖麻蚕茧生产
    安徽省积极发展蓖麻蚕茧的生产。今年在蓖麻蚕产区亳县、太和等八个县配发了蚕种八百八十盒，目前各地鲜茧即将上市。当涂县和平和新联两个农业生产合作社第一季饲养了一百盒，平均每盒产鲜茧三十五至四十斤。
    蓖麻蚕是三年前中国科学院从国外引来试养的。它的生命力较其他蚕种强，能够适应阴雨、潮湿和高温气候，易于饲养成长，每年可养四、五批。同时蓖麻蚕所吃的蓖麻叶是一年生植物，可在沙地、山地等空闲地大量种植。这些有利条件，都促进了蓖麻蚕的发展。
