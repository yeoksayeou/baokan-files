Column: Saving National Wealth From All Aspects

    The Harbin City Company of the China Food Company, criticized in Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report, recently inspected its management work over the past year and resolved to correct its mistakes. They plan to accumulate 170,000 yuan for the state in the second half of this year.

    The company's leading cadres and all employees focused on criticizing the past erroneous thinking that food is a fresh commodity, prone to spoilage, rot, death, and injury, making losses unavoidable, and therefore neglecting to improve management. They found that more than fifty waste incidents last year could have been completely avoided. The employees also painfully examined the losses caused by the company leadership's bureaucracy. Livestock farm employees revealed that company leaders had long failed to approve the addition of cattle troughs, wasting more than 300,000 catties of fodder. Last year, after the Discipline Inspection Commission of the CPC Harbin Municipal Committee and other units sent people to the company for in-depth inspection and punished the personnel involved, the company's management improved for a time, but the leadership became complacent, and the past shortcomings reappeared.

    After inspection, the employees are prepared to launch a labor emulation campaign to increase production and practice thrift, improve the methods of keeping and feeding pigs and cattle, and plan to increase the weight of pigs and cattle on the livestock farm by more than 300,000 catties by the end of the year. In terms of fruits, they will organize purchases according to market needs and seasonal changes, allocate them in a timely and reasonable manner, and strengthen storage to reduce losses caused by deterioration. In addition, they will strengthen financial accounting work, strictly implement consolidation, and reverse the long-term loss situation. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

### 哈尔滨食品公司检查浪费现象

    哈尔滨食品公司检查浪费现象
    在国务院副总理李富春报告中受到批评的中国食品公司哈尔滨市公司，最近检查了一年来的经营管理工作，决心纠正错误，计划在今年下半年给国家积累十七万元。
    公司的领导干部和全体职工着重批判了过去认为食品是鲜活商品，易腐、易烂、易死、易伤，损失是不可避免的，因而忽视改进经营管理的错误思想。他们检查出去年五十多次浪费事件是完全可以避免的。职工们还沉痛地检查了公司领导上的官僚主义所造成的损失。牲畜场职工揭发公司领导长期不批准添置牛槽，浪费了三十多万斤草料。去年，中共哈尔滨市委员会纪律检查委员会等单位派人到公司深入检查并处分有关人员后，公司的经营管理曾一度有所改善，但因领导干部产生了自满情绪，使过去的缺点又重新出现。
    经过检查，职工们准备开展增产节约劳动竞赛，改进猪牛的保管、饲养方法，计划到年底，牧畜场的猪牛要增加重量三十多万斤；在水果方面，要根据市场需要和季节变化，按计划组织进货，及时合理地调拨，并加强保管，减少因变质引起的损失；此外还要加强财务会计工作，严格实行整编，把长期亏损局面扭转过来。　（据新华社讯）
