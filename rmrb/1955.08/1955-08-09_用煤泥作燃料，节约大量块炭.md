    Using Coal Slurry as Fuel Saves Large Quantities of Lump Coal
    Gu Ye
    The Taiyuan Cement Plant, by using coal slurry as fuel, has saved the nation lump coal worth more than 4,000 yuan in the past six months.

    Before 1952, the coal grinding section of the Taiyuan Cement Plant was filled with thick smoke day and night, and coal dust flew around, not only wasting a large amount of coal dust but also seriously affecting the health of the workers. To solve this problem, the factory installed water dust collectors, which turned the coal dust into coal slurry, and the workers no longer inhaled dirty air. However, more than two tons of coal slurry remained every day, and by the second half of 1954, the coal slurry had piled up into a small mountain, seriously affecting production and hindering the movement of coal carriers. To solve this problem, the factory decided to sell the coal slurry to the workers, but the workers thought the coal slurry was not easy to burn, and no one came to buy it. Finally, they had to send carts to haul it away, but the carts were too slow, so they sent trucks, which relieved the threat of coal slurry, but wasted a lot of money.

    While everyone was worried about this matter, the staff of the technical department discovered that some factories had successfully used coal slurry in coke ovens. They also heard that the bathhouse of the Liulihe Cement Plant was using coal slurry to boil water, so they decided to use the coal slurry in the dryer, which required a large amount of fuel every day. At the beginning of this year, after several experiments, they narrowed the gaps in the furnace grate that was originally suitable for lump coal, taught the workers how to burn coal slurry, and installed a wind turbine on the soil dryer, so that coal slurry could replace all or part of the lump coal. However, because the coal slurry burned quickly, the number of times coal had to be added was more than doubled compared to burning lump coal, and at first, most workers were unwilling to use it. After the factory's leading staff explained to the workers that using coal slurry could save the country a lot of construction funds, the workers said, "We will burn one ton more if we can, even if it takes a little more effort, we can save a lot of lump coal," and therefore they all competed to use coal slurry.

    用煤泥作燃料，节约大量块炭
    顾页
    太原水泥厂利用煤泥作燃料，半年来已为国家节省了价值四千多元的块炭。
    一九五二年以前，太原水泥厂煤磨工段里日夜浓烟弥漫，煤粉末随风飞扬，不仅浪费了大量的煤粉，而且严重地影响了工人的健康。工厂为了解决这个问题，安装了水收尘器，使煤粉变成了煤泥，工人们再不吸肮脏的空气了。但是每天剩下的煤泥达两吨以上，到一九五四年后半年，煤泥竟堆积成了一座小山，严重地影响了生产，阻碍了运煤工人的行动。厂里为解决这个问题，就决定把煤泥卖给工人，但是，工人们嫌煤泥不好烧，谁也不来买。最后，只得派大车拉出扔掉，大车拉得太慢，又派汽车拉，这才解除了煤泥的威胁，但是却因此浪费了很多钱。
    当大家都在为这件事发愁的时候，技术科的工作人员们发现有的厂在煤焦炉试用煤泥成功。又听说琉璃河水泥厂澡塘烧水已利用煤泥，于是就决定把煤泥到用每天需要大量燃料的烘干机上去。今年年初，经过多次试验，又把原来适应用块炭的炉条缝隙改窄，教给工人烧煤泥的办法，并在土料烘干机上安了风车，这样煤泥就可以代替全部或部分块炭。但因为煤泥化得快，比烧块炭添煤的次数增加了一倍多，起初多数工人都不愿意用它。当工厂的领导工作人员向工人们讲清利用煤泥可以为国家节省许多建设资金以后，工人们都说：“能多用一吨，我们就烧它一吨，虽然费点劲，省的块炭可不少呀”因而都争着用煤泥。
