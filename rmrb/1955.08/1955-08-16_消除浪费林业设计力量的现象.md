    Eliminate the Phenomenon of Wasting Forestry Design Resources
    Mei Fengxiang
    During the period of large-scale economic construction, the forestry sector, like other sectors, often feels a shortage of design resources in construction work, and design work cannot keep up with the needs of construction. The Ministry of Forestry is preparing to build a tannin chemical plant in Beijing, but due to a lack of design resources, preparations have been underway for three years without any progress. The flatcar line project of the Hangzhou Timber Yard and the revetment project of the Cuiluan Forestry Bureau have both caused the first quarter's construction plan to fail because design documents could not be rushed out. Therefore, the conservation and rational use of design resources have become an extremely important issue in forestry construction.
    However, even as design work is increasingly unable to meet construction needs, the forest industry system within the forestry sector continues to experience serious waste of design resources. The Harbin Forestry Administration Bureau, the Yichun Forestry Administration Bureau, and the Lumber Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Forestry signed design contracts with the Design Company of the Ministry of Forestry in September of last year for forest railways, highways, houses, mechanical installation, and other projects to be constructed in 1955. However, due to a lack of in-depth investigation and research by the construction units when proposing projects, and the failure to correctly affirm construction plans in advance, many survey and design projects completed by the design units at great effort were scrapped. This not only caused waste of manpower, materials, and financial resources for the design departments, but also brought adverse effects to the entire forestry construction undertaking.
    The Design Company of the Ministry of Forestry completed all the preliminary surveying, preliminary design, and technical design for the forest railways of the Shangganling Forestry Bureau under the Yichun Forestry Administration Bureau and the Yilan Forestry Bureau under the Harbin Forestry Administration Bureau in November 1954. However, at this point, the Harbin and Yichun Forestry Administration Bureaus suddenly notified the cessation of construction. This resulted in the scrapping of 217 kilometers of preliminary surveying, 114 kilometers of preliminary design, and 124 kilometers of technical design. These figures represent 39 percent of the annual forest railway preliminary surveying task, 25 percent of the total preliminary design task, and 34 percent of the annual technical design task, respectively. That is to say, one-third of the annual task was scrapped!
    The Design Company of the Ministry of Forestry surveyed and designed four highways for the Shanhetun, Huanan, and other forestry bureaus under the Harbin Forestry Administration Bureau in 1954. However, the survey and design of three of these highways were scrapped. The resulting losses were: 351 kilometers of preliminary surveying, equivalent to 89 percent of the annual highway preliminary surveying task, and 89 kilometers of fixed surveying, equivalent to 74 percent of the annual fixed surveying task.
    Many construction units, after signing design contracts, suddenly propose to stop construction while the design work is in progress, often causing great waste. For example, the design task for the 2,000-square-meter office building and the 190-square-meter boiler room of the Tonghe Forestry Bureau under the Harbin Forestry Administration Bureau was requested to be stopped after the preliminary design was completed, resulting in the design unit losing 40 workdays. The Lumber Industry Bureau requested the design unit to complete the design of 6,145 square meters of housing, but when the technical design was completed, the bureau did not use it, causing the design unit to lose 338 workdays. The preliminary design of the 1,000-square-meter office building and the 1,200-square-meter dormitory of the Mudanjiang Tool Factory was completed, and the technical design was 40 percent complete, but the bureau decided to reduce the construction area by 800 square meters, resulting in the loss of 60 design workdays.
      The same situation exists in mechanical installation. When the technical design of the log conveying machine installation project of Factory 61 of the Lumber Industry Bureau was 48 percent complete, and the technical design of the hand-held door and window plywood machine of Factory 72 was 100 percent complete, the construction units notified the cessation of construction.
    According to the statistics of the above-mentioned waste figures, a total of 9,545 design workdays and 170,000 yuan in Renminbi were lost.
    Is the scrapping of these surveys and designs due to the inferior quality of the surveys and designs, rendering them unusable? The facts prove that this is not the case. The serious waste is constantly occurring mainly because:
    First, the forestry bureaus are unclear about the resources in the areas under their jurisdiction. Before determining construction projects, these units did not organize forest survey teams to conduct a comprehensive survey of forest resources. When the staff of these units discovered trees, they simply glanced at them and estimated that they could yield a certain number of cubic meters of timber, and then reported to the competent department to request construction. When the survey and design work was in progress or had been completed, it was discovered that there was no forest area, or that they did not know how many resources there were, and it was impossible to assess the investment effect, so they had to stop construction, resulting in a serious waste of survey and design resources. For example, the Shanhetun Forestry Bureau reported to the Harbin Forestry Administration Bureau that they had discovered a large forest area and needed to build a highway to transport the harvested timber, but after the survey team completed the survey, it was proved that there were no forest resources in this area at all.
    Second, the forestry bureaus did not conduct a serious economic survey of the surrounding environment, terrain, and other natural conditions of the construction site before blindly proposing design projects. Therefore, the question of what transportation method should be adopted in this forest area (should ice roads be built, or highways? Flatcars, or forest railways?) often could not be determined even after the survey and design were completed. For example, the Wudaoku Forestry Bureau under the Yichun Forestry Administration Bureau proposed to build a forest railway this year, requesting the design company to send people to survey. However, when the survey team arrived at the site, they could not carry out the survey because the transportation method had not been determined. The Shangganling Forestry Bureau also could not use the survey and design after it was completed because the transportation method could not be determined. The Huangnihezi Forestry Bureau under the Jilin Forestry Administration Bureau preliminarily surveyed 100 kilometers and fixed surveyed 22 kilometers of highways in 1954, but switched to surveying forest railways midway. The Shanhetun Forestry Bureau originally planned to build 20 kilometers of flatcar lines, and then changed to highways, but after preliminarily surveying 56 kilometers and initially surveying 15 kilometers, they didn't want it anymore.
    Third, the leaders of some construction units did not conscientiously implement the national policy of key construction and did not attach importance to the rational and concentrated use of state investment. For example, the Youhao Forestry Bureau and Tonghe Forestry Bureau under the Yichun Forestry Administration Bureau, and the Lumber Industry Bureau, blindly proposed projects that could be built or not built, or should be postponed, and signed contracts with the design departments. When the design work was in progress, the competent department did not approve the construction project, resulting in a waste of design resources.
    In order to eliminate waste in construction, the forestry sector must seriously learn from past lessons and do its best to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings and errors. Before deciding on a construction project, each construction unit must organize sufficient forest survey forces to conduct a comprehensive survey of the forest area under its jurisdiction, and clarify the resource situation such as the forest reserves, tree species, and timber yield. According to the amount of resources, the construction tasks must be determined cautiously. In order to avoid blindness in construction, a thorough investigation and research should be conducted based on forest resources to make an overall production plan. According to the forest reserves and timber yield, the operation years, logging methods, operation methods, and management methods should be determined, and the business areas and forest classes should be divided before construction. The responsible persons of the construction units must establish the concept of saving funds for the country. When deciding to build a project, they must fully consider the investment benefits and must not simply emphasize the need without considering saving state funds. All projects that can be built or not built should not be built at all, and those that should be postponed must be postponed.

    消除浪费林业设计力量的现象
    梅凤祥
    在大规模的经济建设时期，林业部门也同其他部门一样，在建设工作中经常感到设计力量不足，设计工作赶不上建设的需要。林业部准备在北京筹建一个丹宁化学工厂，由于设计力量缺乏，筹备了三年仍未动工。杭州贮木场的平车线路工程和翠峦森工局的护岸工程都因设计文件赶制不出来，而使今年第一季度的建设计划落空了。因此，设计力量的节约和合理使用，已成为林业建设中一个极为重要的问题。
    但是，就在这种设计工作愈来愈不能满足建设需要的情况下，林业部门森林工业系统中却不断发生严重浪费设计力量的现象。林业部哈尔滨森工管理局、伊春森工管理局及制材工业局等单位，在去年九月间同林业部设计公司签订了需在一九五五年施工的森林铁路、公路、房屋、机械安装等工程的设计合同，但是，由于各建设单位在提出工程项目时缺乏深入调查研究，事先没有正确地肯定建设方案，以致设计单位花费很大力量完成的许多勘察设计的项目作废了。这不仅给设计部门造成人力、物力、财力上的浪费，而且也给整个林业建设事业带来了不良影响。
    林业部设计公司在一九五四年十一月把伊春森工管理局所属上甘岭森工局和哈尔滨森工管理局所属依兰森工局的森林铁路的草测、初步设计和技术设计全部完成了；但是，就在这时，哈尔滨和伊春两个森工管理局忽然通知停止建设。这样就使得二百一十七公里的草测和一百一十四公里的初步设计和一百二十四公里的技术设计全部作废了。这些数字分别相当于全年森林铁路草测任务量的百分之三十九，全部初步设计任务量的百分之二十五，全年技术设计任务量的百分之三十四，这就是说，全年任务量的三分之一作废了！
    林业部设计公司在一九五四年为哈尔滨森工管理局所属的山河屯、桦南等森工局勘察和设计了四条公路，但是，后来有三条公路的勘察设计都白白作废了。由此造成的损失是：草测三百五十一公里，相当于全年公路草测任务量的百分之八十九，定测八十九公里，相当于全年定测任务量的百分之七十四。
    很多建设单位在签订设计合同后，当设计工作正在进行时，忽然提出不建了，往往造成很大的浪费。例如，哈尔滨森工管理局所属通河森工局的办公室二千平方公尺、锅炉房一百九十平方公尺的设计任务，当初步设计已经全部完成后，该局又请求停止设计，结果使设计单位损失了四十个工作日。制材工业局请求设计单位作成六千一百四十五平方公尺的房屋设计，但当技术设计全部完成时，该局又不用了，使设计单位损失了三百三十八个工作日。牡丹江工具工厂的一千平方公尺办公室和一千二百平方公尺宿舍的初步设计全部完成，技术设计完成到百分之四十的进度时，该局又决定削减八百平方公尺的建筑面积，结果损失了六十个设计工作日。
      在机械安装方面也有同样的情形。制材工业局六十一厂的原木运送机安装工程的技术设计在完成百分之四十八时，七十二厂手提门窗胶合板机的技术设计完成百分之百时，建设单位都通知停建了。
    根据上述几方面浪费数字的统计，共损失设计工作日九千五百四十五个、人民币十七万元。
    这些勘察设计的作废是不是由于勘察设计质量低劣不能适用呢？事实证明，不是这样的。这些严重的浪费所以会不断产生，主要是因为：
    第一、各森工局对所管辖的区域的资源不清。这些单位在确定建设工程项目之前，没有组织森林调查队对森林资源进行全盘调查，这些单位的工作人员发现有树木时，只是用眼睛一看，心里一估计可出材若干立方公尺，即向主管部门报请修建。当勘察设计工作正在进行或已完成后，发现没有林区，或根本不知道有多少资源，无法考查投资效果，因而不得不停止建设，这样就招致了勘察设计的严重浪费。如山河屯森工局报告哈尔滨森工管理局说，他们发现了大片林区，需要修建公路运搬采伐的木材，但经勘察队勘察完毕后，证明这个地区根本没有森林资源。
    第二、各森工局事先没有对建设地点的周围环境、地形、地势等自然条件进行认真的经济调查，就盲目提出设计项目。因此，对于在这个林区究竟应采什么方式运输的问题（是修冰道呢，还是修公路？是平车呢，还是森林铁路？），常常到勘测设计完成后还不能肯定。如伊春森工管理局所属五道库森工局今年提出要建设森林铁路，请求设计公司派人勘测，但勘测队到达了现场，因运输方式尚未肯定而无法施测。上甘岭森工局也是因为运输方式不能肯定，使勘察设计作完后不能用了。吉林森工管理局所属黄泥河子森工局一九五四年草测了一百公里和定测了二十二公里的公路，但在中途又改测森林铁路。山河屯森工局原计划修二十公里平车线路，以后又改公路，但当草测了五十六公里和初测了十五公里后，又不要了。
    第三、某些建设单位的领导人员，没有认真贯彻国家重点建设的方针，不重视国家投资的合理和集中使用。如伊春森工管理局所属友好森工局、通河森工局、制材工业局，把可建可不建的或应当缓建的工程盲目提出，并同设计部门签订了合同；当设计工作正进行的时候，由于主管部门对建设工程不批准，结果造成设计力量的浪费。
    为了杜绝建设中的浪费，林业部门必须严肃地记取过去的教训，尽最大力量克服上述缺点和错误。每个建设单位在决定工程项目之前，必须组织足够的森林调查力量，对自己所管辖的林区进行全盘调查，弄清林区蓄积量、树材种、出材量等资源情况，根据资源的多寡，慎重地确定建设任务。为避免建设中的盲目性，应根据林区资源进行周密的调查研究，做出生产的总体规划，根据林区蓄积量、出材量来肯定作业年限、采伐方式、作业方式、经营方式，并划分事业区、林班等，然后进行建设。建设单位的负责人员必须树立起为国家节约资金的观念，决定建设一个工程时，必须充分考虑投资效益，绝不能单纯强调需要而不顾节约国家资金，凡可建可不建的，应一律不建，应当缓建的必须缓建。
