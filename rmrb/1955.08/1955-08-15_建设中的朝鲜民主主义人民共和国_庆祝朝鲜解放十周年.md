The Democratic People's Republic of Korea Under Construction
    ——Celebrating the Tenth Anniversary of the Liberation of Korea

    Today is the tenth anniversary of the liberation of Korea.

    Korea is an ancient country with a long history, but from 1910, it was under the dark rule of Japanese imperialism for a long time. For the freedom and independence of their motherland, the Korean people fought heroically, one after another, for thirty-five years against colonial rule. Ten years ago, the Soviet army smashed the armed forces of Japanese imperialism and entered northern Korea, liberating the people of northern Korea; however, after the people of southern Korea were freed from the colonial rule of Japanese imperialism, they were oppressed by the Syngman Rhee group supported by the United States, causing Korea to be divided north and south. Therefore, a new task facing the Korean people is to build a democratic base in North Korea and strive to achieve the reunification and complete liberation of the motherland.

    The liberated people of northern Korea, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, have achieved brilliant achievements in their efforts to build northern Korea into a strong, happy, and democratic base for the motherland. However, the barbaric aggression launched by foreign imperialism and the Syngman Rhee group against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 1950 interrupted the peaceful construction of northern Korea. The Korean people took up arms to heroically defend the independence of their country and the achievements of the revolution. With the support of the Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world, the Korean people, after three years of heroic struggle, finally won the victory in the anti-aggression war, drove the aggressors back to the 38th parallel, and achieved an armistice, which not only defended the independence of the country but also made a great contribution to the cause of world peace.

    Since the armistice, the Korean people have been persistently striving to maintain the armistice and to restore the reunification of the motherland on the basis of peace, democracy, and national independence. The people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, who have received fraternal assistance from the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, are victoriously implementing the three-year plan for reconstruction.

    建设中的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国
    ——庆祝朝鲜解放十周年
    今天是朝鲜解放十周年纪念日。
    朝鲜是一个有悠久历史的古国，但从一九一○年起，长期处于日本帝国主义的黑暗统治之下，为了祖国的自由和独立，朝鲜人民曾经前仆后继地进行了三十五年反抗殖民统治的英勇斗争。十年前，苏联军队粉碎了日本帝国主义的武装部队，进驻朝鲜北部，使得朝鲜北部的人民获得了解放；但是朝鲜南部人民在摆脱了日本帝国主义的殖民统治之后，又遭到美国支持的李承晚集团的压迫，使朝鲜陷于南北的分裂。因此摆在朝鲜人民面前的是一个新的任务：建设北朝鲜民主基地，为实现祖国的统一和全部解放而斗争。
    解放了的朝鲜北部的人民在朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的领导下，得到苏联的无私的援助，在把朝鲜北部建设成为祖国的强盛幸福的民主基地的努力中获得了辉煌的成就。但是外国帝国主义和李承晚集团在一九五○年对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发动的野蛮的侵略，打断了朝鲜北部人民的和平建设，朝鲜人民拿起武器来英勇地捍卫国家的独立和革命的成果。在中国人民和世界各国人民的支援之下，朝鲜人民经过三年的英勇斗争，终于取得了反侵略战争的胜利，把侵略军打回到三八线，实现了停战，不仅保卫了国家的独立，而且对世界的和平事业作出了巨大的贡献。
    停战以后，朝鲜人民为维护停战和争取在和平民主和民族独立的基础上恢复祖国的统一而坚持努力，得到苏联、中国和其它人民民主国家兄弟般援助的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的人民正在胜利地实现着恢复建设的三年计划。（附图片）
