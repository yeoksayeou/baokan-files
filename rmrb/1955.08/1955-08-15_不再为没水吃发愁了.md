To the Editor:

    The five villages of Chafang, Langwo, Wopu, Dongjiafang, and Xinzhuangzi in Zhuolu County, Hebei Province, are located in areas with high terrain and lack of water sources, and the problem of drinking water has not been resolved for many years. A few years ago, a well thirty-seven fathoms deep was dug in Chafang Village, but the water output was limited and still not enough. The farmers in Langwo Village complained: "People of Langwo, unlucky ghosts; eat snow in winter, drink rainwater in summer; in the spring drought, carry water from the ditch eight miles away! Carrying water delays planting, planting delays drinking water." Under the condition of water source difficulties, the farmers in these villages made plans before using water: wash their faces first, then wash pots and bowls; wash clothes once a year, combined with mixing mud to plaster the house.

    In order to solve the drinking water difficulties of the farmers in these villages, in the winter of 1954, the Zhuolu County People's Committee sent technicians to the local area to conduct water source surveys and engineering design, and invested more than 9,000 yuan to build three drinking water projects in Chafang, Langwo, and Wopu in April this year. These projects were completed successively in mid-June, and since then the drinking water problem of 5,181 people in these five villages has been solved. When the clean water flowed into these villages, everyone was happy and grateful. Zhang Quan, a 70-year-old man in Chafang Village, said: "I have been troubled by the suffering of not having water to drink all my life, and now Chairman Mao has sent people to relieve us." With sufficient water sources, the farmers' confidence in increasing livestock has been strengthened. They also plan to convert 300 mu of dry land into paddy fields.

    不再为没水吃发愁了编辑同志：
    河北省涿鹿县茶房、狼窝、窝铺、董家房、辛庄子五个村子地势较高，缺乏水源，多年来吃水问题一直得不到解决。几年前茶房村打了一眼深三十七丈的水井，但是出水有限，仍然不够用。狼窝村的农民埋怨地说：“狼窝人，背兴鬼；冬天吃雪，夏天喝雨水；春旱八里外沟口去驮水！驮水误种地，种地别吃水。”在水源困难的情况下，这些村子的农民用水前都先作好计划：先洗脸，后刷锅、刷碗；一年洗一次衣服，还得结合着和泥抹房。
    为了解决这些村农民的饮水困难，一九五四年冬天，涿鹿县人民委员会派技术人员到当地进行了水源勘测和工程设计，并投资九千多元，今年四月间在茶房、狼窝、窝铺兴修三处饮水工程。六月中旬这些工程先后竣工，从此这五个村五千一百八十一人的饮水问题解决了。当清洁的流水流到这几个村子的时候，大家又高兴又感激，茶房村七十多岁的张全老汉说：“一辈子愁着没水吃的痛苦，这下毛主席派人给咱解除了。”由于有了充足的水源，农民们增殖家畜的信心加强了。他们还计划把三百亩旱田改为水田。
