How Mianfeng Agricultural Cooperative Solves the Contradiction Between Members Engaging in Agriculture and Handicrafts
　　Zhang Jiaqi
　　Mianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, is an old cooperative established in 1953. In this area, many farmers also engage in small-scale handicrafts. Out of the cooperative's 206 households, 35 households are also engaged in handicrafts, including carpenters, blacksmiths, stonemasons, basket weavers, sugar boilers, tobacco curing masters, pig butchers, cotton fluffers, barbers, and tailors. The vast majority of these craftsmen have land, and they have always farmed at home during the busy farming season and worked outside during the slack season. After the establishment of agricultural cooperatives in the village, these handicraft households understood the benefits of taking the socialist road, and they mostly joined the cooperative with the attitude of "wives, children, and land to the cooperative, while I go outside to earn money."

　　The biggest problem encountered by handicraft workers after joining the cooperative was the contradiction between working outside and laboring in the cooperative. In general cooperatives with little land and surplus labor, agricultural members hope that handicraft workers who have joined the cooperative can go out and work more, so that everyone can earn more work points. The problem is not too difficult to solve. However, in cooperatives like Mianfeng, which have a lot of land and little labor, it becomes very difficult for handicraft workers to go out to work. Judging from the cooperative's production situation, if the labor force is reasonably organized and allocated, it is not insufficient. The fundamental problem lies in the ideological problems of the cooperative's leadership and members. They see that handicraft workers earn more and eat better outside, and mistakenly believe that this is "getting rich individually," which is not in line with the principle of common prosperity. They believe that since land has been distributed and the cooperative has been joined, they should work hard in the cooperative and should not earn double portions. Due to these deviations in understanding, the cooperative experienced restrictions and suppression of members who also engaged in handicrafts, which seriously affected the unity of members and the consolidation of the cooperative.

　　In the past two years, the cooperative's management committee, based on the principle of making the best use of talent, has also arranged for several service-oriented handicraft households. For example, a member who can cut hair is a child in his teens, and his farm work is only equivalent to auxiliary labor. Letting him cut hair for the members can earn him the income of a major laborer throughout the year. The cooperative bought two sewing machines for several sewing workers to sew clothes for the members, which reduced the trouble of members going far away to have their clothes sewn outside, and freed up female labor to invest in agricultural production. The members are very satisfied with this solution, and the income of the members who also engage in handicrafts is also guaranteed. However, the measures taken by the cooperative for the majority of members who need to go out to work are not correct enough. Initially, the cooperative allowed members who also engage in handicrafts to go out to work, but all income had to be turned over to the cooperative, and the cooperative assessed work points based on equivalent labor. The members who also engage in handicrafts were unwilling to do this. Later, it was changed to turning over the income to the cooperative, and the cooperative calculated his income based on the highest labor day. In this way, the agricultural members felt that they were at a disadvantage, and the members who also engage in handicrafts also felt that it was not worth it. Both sides were unhappy. The cooperative felt that the problem of going out to work was difficult to solve, so it tried to restrict them from going out to work. For example, if handicraft members go out to work, the cooperative will not issue household registration certificates. Carpenters Zeng Huashan, Si Hanzhong, and stone and wood worker Si Hanguang were all called back by the cooperative with official letters when they were repairing warehouses and railways outside. The cooperative director also selected stone and wood worker Si Hanguang as a typical example, and held several nights of "struggle meetings" with all handicraft workers and their families present, pursuing their thinking, investigating their motives, and criticizing their selfish and self-interested thoughts. Finally, they were asked to express their attitude and guarantee that they would not go out to work in the future. This caused serious dissatisfaction among the members who also engage in handicrafts. During the rectification of agricultural cooperatives this spring, the cooperative made a review and criticism of this practice, and stipulated that members who also engage in handicrafts could go out to work during the slack season. However, because the problem was not seriously solved ideologically, the cooperative's leading cadres still used various methods to restrict members who also engage in handicrafts from going out to work, such as requiring members who also engage in handicrafts to do as many labor days as other members, and not allowing them to go out even during the slack season. The problem has not been solved.

　　The above-mentioned erroneous practices have had adverse effects both inside and outside the cooperative. The cooperative does not allow handicraft members to go out to work, nor can it properly arrange work and give play to their skills, so the income of these households has generally decreased. Many households have encountered financial difficulties. For example, the income of ten households of blacksmiths, carpenters, and stonemasons has increased from an agricultural point of view compared with before joining the cooperative, but from the perspective of personal total income, they have all decreased by one-third to one-half compared with before joining the cooperative. Blacksmith Hu Shaoqing has weak labor and many children. Although he works hard to participate in field labor, his income is limited, and he is now in debt for more than eighty yuan. Some households lack money for oil and salt, and have even sold some of their tools. As a result, handicraft members and their families are extremely dissatisfied with the agricultural cooperative. They not only complain within the cooperative and are negative in production, but also tell their relatives and friends that the cooperative is bad. Some of the cooperative's leading cadres do not see the shortcomings in their work, but instead believe that these people are "sabotaging" the agricultural cooperative. Driven by financial difficulties, some handicraft members go out to find work on their own without the consent of the cooperative. Carpenter Li Decheng secretly ran out to repair warehouses. The cooperative sent an official letter, and the local authorities dismissed him. He ran to Chengdu again to work for the masses. He sneaked back in the middle of the night during the New Year and left before dawn, not daring to meet the cooperative's leading cadres. Restricting handicraft workers from going out to work also affects the needs of farmers' production and life. Some farmers have to travel a long way to find craftsmen to repair farm tools. They complain that the cooperative has "tied up" people, which is also inconvenient for those outside the cooperative.

　　Recently, under the leadership of the Party branch, the cooperative committee discussed this issue. Everyone began to realize that handicraft workers are also working people, and their labor is necessary for farmers' production and life. They earn wages by working outside and live a better life, mainly by relying on their own labor and skills. Agricultural members should not be absolutely egalitarian and compare themselves with them everywhere. Common prosperity is by no means pulling everyone down to the same level. From the perspective of being conducive to production and unity, a reasonable solution should be found. On this ideological basis, the cooperative successively held three representative meetings of handicraft members. At the meetings, the leading personnel of the cooperative management committee, in addition to reviewing some of the incorrect ideas and practices in the past, put forward specific solutions based on the characteristics of handicraft work: for some handicraft workers who are willing to engage in agricultural production in the cooperative all year round or for most of the time, and only need to go out to work during a certain season, such as building craftsmen, sugar boilers, tobacco curers, and cotton fluffers, the general policy is to work in the cooperative during the busy farming season and go out during the slack season. According to the agricultural season, the time for handicraft workers to go out to work is determined. For example, Qingming, Guyu, Lixia, and Xiaoman are the seasons for spring plowing, rushing to harvest and transplant, and Qiufen, Hanlu, Shuangjiang, and Lidong are the seasons for autumn harvest and autumn plowing. These seasons are busy for farming, and generally members who also engage in handicrafts should work in the cooperative. During the rest of the time, they can go out to work if there is work outside, and they can get their own wages, and no labor days are assessed in the cooperative. If there is no work outside, they still participate in production in the cooperative. In addition, members who also engage in handicrafts can also make appointments for handicraft work in advance and arrange them, leaving the busy farming season for work in the cooperative. For several iron, wood, and stone craftsmen with good skills who are prepared to work outside all year round or for most of the time and are very much needed by the society, the family's land is still kept in the cooperative, and the labor required for the land is calculated. In addition to what he and his family can do, the handicraft worker pays the cooperative wages at the price of the cooperative's labor day for the insufficient part; or the whole family does not join the cooperative, and the land is leased by the cooperative or part of it is leased (the rent is equivalent to the general social rent), etc. Both parties basically agree with this method. In solving this problem, the cooperative management committee also paid attention to reasonably organizing and allocating labor, improving the method of assessing work, and avoiding the handicraft worker members from going out to work affecting the cooperative's production plan.

　　These methods of Mianfeng Agricultural Cooperative to solve the contradiction of members who also engage in handicrafts going out to work are only some specific methods researched locally according to needs, and they may not be completely reasonable and applicable. They intend to study and revise them during implementation. However, this spirit of being conducive to production and unity is worth promoting.

　　棉丰农业合作社怎样解决社员经营农业同手工业的矛盾
　　张家骐
    四川简阳县棉丰农业生产合作社是一九五三年成立的一个老社。这一带农民兼营小手工业的很多，全社二百零六户，兼营手工业的即有三十五户，计有木匠、铁匠、石匠、篾匠、熬糖匠、烤烟师、杀猪匠、弹花匠和理发匠、裁缝等。这些手工业者绝大多数都有土地，他们历来都是农忙在家务农，农闲外出做工。村里建立了农业合作社，这些手工业户了解到走社会主义道路的好处，他们大都抱着“老婆娃娃土地交社，自己到外边赚钱”的态度参加到社里来。
    手工业工人入社后，遇到的最大问题是外出工作同在社劳动的矛盾。在一般土地少劳力有剩余的社里，经营农业的社员希望入了社的手工业工人能多出去作活，大家好多得点工分，问题解决还不是太困难的。但在像棉丰社这样土地多劳力少的社里，手工业工人出外做工，便成了很难解决的问题。就社的生产情况看，如果合理组织调配，劳力并不是不足的，根本的问题还在于社的领导骨干和社员思想上有问题。他们看到手工业工人在外边收入多，吃的好，就误认为这是闹“个人发财”，不符合共同富裕的原则；认为既然分了田，入了社，就应当好好在社内劳动，不应当赚双份等。由于有这些认识上的偏差，社里就发生了限制打击兼营手工业的社员的现象，严重影响了社员之间的团结和社的巩固。
    两年来，社管理委员会曾根据人尽其才的原则，也安置了几个服务性质的手工业户，如一个会理发的社员，是个十多岁的娃娃，干农活只抵个辅助劳力，让他给社员理发，全年可得一个主要劳力的收入。社内给几个缝纫工人买了两架缝衣机，给社员缝衣服，减少了社员到外边缝衣服跑远道的麻烦，又能腾出妇女劳动力来投入农业生产，社员对这种解决办法很满意，兼营手工业的社员的收入也得到了保证。但对多数需要外出做工的手工业的社员，社里采取的办法是不够正确的。起初，社内允许兼营手工业的社员出外做工，但收入要全部交社，社内以同等劳动力评工分，这样兼营手工业的社员不愿意。以后又改为收入交社，社给他按最高劳动日计算，这样，经营农业的社员觉得吃亏，兼营手工业的社员也觉得算不过账来，仍然不满，双方都不乐意。社里觉得外出做工问题不好解决就想法限制他们外出做工。如手工业社员外出做工，社不给办户口证明。木工曾化山，司汗中，石木工司汗光等在外修仓库修铁路，都被社里用公函调回。社长并选择石木工司汗光作典型，让全体手工业者和他们的家属都到场，开了几夜“斗争会”，追思想、查动机、批判自私自利思想，最后让他们表明态度，保证今后不再出外做工，这样引起兼营手工业社员的严重不满。今年春天整顿农业合作社时，社里对这种作法虽然作了检查批判，并规定了兼营手工业社员农闲可以外出做工的办法，但因没有从思想上认真解决问题，社里的领导骨干仍然采用各种各样办法限制兼营手工业的社员外出做工，如要求兼营手工业社员同其他社员作一样多的劳动日，本来是农闲也不让外出等，问题仍没有得到解决。
    以上这些错误的做法，在社内社外都产生了不良影响。社里不允许手工业社员外出做工，又不能适当安排活路，发挥他们的技能，这些户的收入普遍减少。许多户生活发生困难，如十户铁、木、石匠，从农业上看，收入比入社前有所增加，但从个人总收入看，就都比入社前减少三分之一到一半。铁匠胡绍清因劳力弱、孩子多，虽然努力参加田间劳动，收入也有限，现已欠债八十多元。有的户缺少油盐钱，甚至把部分工具也卖掉了。这样一来，手工业社员和他们的家属对农业合作社极为不满，他们不但在社内发牢骚，生产消极，而且还到亲戚朋友家说社的坏话。有些社的领导骨干看不到自己工作中的缺点，反而认为这些人“破坏”农业合作社。手工业社员为生活困难所迫，有些不经社同意就自己出去找营生。木工李德成偷跑出外修仓库，社内去了公函，当地就把他解雇了，他又跑到成都，替群众干活。他过年时半夜偷跑回来，天不明就走了，不敢见社内领导骨干的面。限制手工业者外出做工，也影响到农民生产和生活的需要。有些农民修农具要跑很远的路去找工匠，他们埋怨社把人“拴死”了，对社外也不方便。
    最近，在党支部的领导下，社委会对这个问题进行了讨论。大家开始认识到手工业者也是劳动人民，他们的劳动为农民生产和生活所必需，他们在外边做工赚得工资，生活好点，主要是凭自己的劳动和技术，经营农业的社员不应绝对平均，处处同他们相比，共同富裕也绝不是扯齐拉平，从有利生产有利团结着眼，应该找寻合理解决办法。在这个思想基础上，社里连续召开了三次手工业社员代表会议，会上社管理委员会领导人员除检讨了过去一些不正确的思想和作法外，根据手工业工作的特点，提出了具体解决办法：对愿意常年或大部分时间在社内从事农业生产、只在一定季节需要外出做工的一些兼营手工业的工人，如盖匠、熬糖、烤烟、弹花等工匠，一般采取农忙在社，农闲外出的方针。又根据农事季节，研究确定农忙农闲，安排手工业者外出劳动时间。如清明、谷雨、立夏、小满是春耕抢收抢栽季节，秋分、寒露、霜降、立冬是秋收秋耕季节，这些季节是农忙，一般兼营手工业的社员应在社干活，其余时间外边有活可到外边干，工资自得，社内不评劳动日。外边没活仍参加社内生产。此外，兼营手工业的社员还可早些预约手工活加以安排，把农忙时间留出来在社内干活。对几个技术好、准备常年或大部分时间在外做工而社会上又很需要的铁、木、石匠，采取家属土地仍留在社内，计算其土地所需劳动，除他自己和家属能作的以外，不足部分，由手工业者按社内劳动日价格付给社以工资；或全家都不入社，土地由社承租或承租其一部分（租额相当于一般社会地租）等办法，这样办法双方基本上同意。在解决这一问题时，社管理委员会还注意了合理组织调配劳动力，改进评工办法，避免手工业工人社员外出做工影响社的生产计划。
    棉丰农业合作社解决兼营手工业的社员外出做工矛盾的这些办法，只是当地根据需要研究出的一些具体办法，不一定完全合理、适用，他们打算在实行中再行研究修改。但是，这种有利生产有利团结的精神，是值得提倡的。
