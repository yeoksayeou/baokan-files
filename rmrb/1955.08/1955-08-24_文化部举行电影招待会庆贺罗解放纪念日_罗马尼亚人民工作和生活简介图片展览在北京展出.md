    新华社二十二日讯　在罗马尼亚解放十一周年前夕——八月二十二日晚，中华人民共和国文化部举行电影招待会，放映罗马尼亚影片“太阳出来了”，对罗马尼亚解放纪念日表示庆贺。
      “太阳出来了”是描写一九四一年到一九四四年，罗马尼亚人民在共产党领导下，对法西斯统治集团进行的英勇斗争。当时，法西斯统治集团把罗马尼亚推入了反苏战争，使罗马尼亚陷入了灾难的境地。罗马尼亚优秀儿女们便在这艰难险恶的环境中，展开了坚贞不屈的反抗运动。
    人民终于胜利了。银幕上最后出现了胜利了的人民无比欢乐的情景——罗马尼亚解放了，“太阳出来了”，罗马尼亚人民满怀信心地瞻望着祖国幸福的前途，热情地欢迎着罗马尼亚的解放者英勇的苏联红军。
    文化部副部长刘芝明和罗马尼亚驻华大使郭佐文，以及首都各界人民一千二百多人，出席了今晚招待会。
    新华社二十三日讯　在罗马尼亚解放十一周年纪念日，首都的中山公园展出了“罗马尼亚人民工作和生活简介图片展览”。
    这个展览是对外文化联络局主办的。从图片上看到罗马尼亚工人和农民在工厂、田野紧张地劳动，以及他们日常劳动后欢度家庭幸福生活的情况。图片还显示了罗马尼亚人民物质生活和文化生活日益丰富的情景。最后展出的图片是中罗两国历年来执行文化、贸易和科学技术等协定后的情形，标志着两国人民牢不可破的友谊进一步巩固和发展。
