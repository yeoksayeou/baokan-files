“Paris Cheers for Beijing” [Note]
Zhao Feng, Deputy Head of the Chinese Art Troupe

The Chinese Art Troupe participated in the Second International Theatre Festival held in Paris and received a warm welcome. The people of Paris and theatre artists from all over the world unanimously praised the glorious tradition and high level of Chinese classical drama, as well as the achievements made in opera reform since the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Paris's cultural and artistic circles first highly valued the profound popular character and realistic tradition of Chinese classical drama. The famous French poet Loa said: "The splendid, joyful, and witty performances of the Art Troupe of the People's Republic of China can be said to be performances of the entire nation. Here, the history of the nation is depicted, the emotions of the nation are displayed, the character of the nation is expressed, and the elite of the nation is contained." The "French Observer" weekly commented: "China retains the most ancient and richest theatrical heritage, characterized by its true social reality. Through drama, the people express their common and individual thoughts and feelings." At the same time, the expressive forms of Chinese classical drama also received extremely high evaluation. The concentrated generalization, artistic exaggeration, dance-like movements, and hypothetical nature of Chinese classical drama are novel to Western audiences, but they do not find them difficult to accept. As the famous French actor Gravier said: "What surprises us most is that this is an art that anyone can understand." The famous French writer Sartre said: "Language barriers and differences in customs do not pose any obstacles." Parisian art critics also greatly praised the skills of the actors and artists. Critics unanimously praised the mime and martial arts skills of the actors and artists, especially the high sense of rhythm and accuracy of their movements. The famous French composer Weiner said: "This is a complete art, a beauty and an amazing accuracy." The strong sense of color and high decorative beauty on the stage also attracted attention from all sides. Almost all Parisian newspapers mentioned the characteristics of Chinese drama in stage art. The famous French writer Triolet said: "It is like a myriad of flowers in full bloom; even the birds spreading their wings in paradise cannot compare to the brilliance of these costumes. The rich contrasts and approximate harmonies are like the rising sun and the rainbow."

The people of Paris and the cultural and artistic circles of Paris showed touching enthusiasm for the Chinese Art Troupe. "French Literature and Art Weekly" devoted several pages to discussing issues related to Chinese classical drama, and television and radio broadcast programs of the Chinese Art Troupe many times. Within a few days after the performance of the Chinese Art Troupe, records and collections of essays were published, and even fashion designers were predicting how Chinese stage art would influence the style and color of clothing. The "National Forum" weekly said: "Chinese culture will no longer be the patent and sphere of influence of scholars, collectors, and travelers. Thanks to the inspiration of Chinese drama, we will not be able to stop here." Because of their contact with Chinese classical drama, the French people became interested in the cultural and social life of New China. Sinologists highly valued our country's recent achievements in exploring and organizing classical and local operas and folk arts. Museum scholars watched every event in New China's work on the protection and excavation of cultural relics with great excitement.

The Deputy Mayor of Paris, Odette Crocq, especially expressed her wishes to the Chinese Art Troupe: "As envoys of peace and envoys of culture, I should represent the people and government of Paris in expressing my respect and gratitude for your outstanding work." The contemporary famous writer Aragon said: "The enthusiastic welcome of the audience to the Chinese Art Troupe shows that Paris has recognized the People's Republic of China."

The French academic and cultural and artistic circles, as well as many social organizations, like the hospitable people of Paris, expressed a warm welcome to the Chinese Art Troupe. Academicians of the French Academy of Sciences, professors from the University of Paris and the School of Oriental Languages, members of the French Writers' National Committee, the most well-known French actors, painters, directors, composers, musicians, and friends of the Franco-Chinese Friendship Association all had friendly meetings with the Chinese Art Troupe or gave them a warm reception. The enthusiasm, frankness, and humility shown by the most famous French actor Philippe at the pleasant suburban outing to entertain the Chinese Art Troupe gave us a deep impression. The most famous French mime artist Marceau expressed his warm friendship to the Chinese Art Troupe and gave a performance and report specifically for the actors of the Art Troupe, giving us the opportunity to systematically understand and learn European mime art, for which we are especially grateful.

When a few critics in Paris discussed Chinese classical drama under the theme of symbolism, we specifically visited the great French poet Aragon and his wife and spent a beautiful and pleasant afternoon in their quiet country villa. They affirmed the high realistic tradition of Chinese classical drama in both content and expression and clearly pointed out that saying that Chinese classical drama is symbolic drama is a complete misunderstanding. Later, his French Literature magazine successively published several articles discussing the realistic tradition of Chinese classical drama, which played a great role in the French public's correct understanding of Chinese classical drama.

Although the Chinese Art Troupe has bid farewell to beautiful Paris, we cannot forget the enthusiastic hospitality of the host of the International Theatre Festival, the famous playwright and actor Julien, we cannot forget the cordial talks and beneficial suggestions of the famous director Hulutong, we cannot forget the respect and love shown by the Parisian public in the theatre for Chinese classical drama, and we cannot forget the Parisian citizens who waited outside the theatre for two hours late at night to pay tribute to the actors.... All these enthusiastic kindnesses make us unforgettable.

During its stay in Paris, the Chinese Art Troupe also visited some famous Parisian museums, the Louvre, and the Palace of Versailles, and came into contact with the treasures of the great French school of painting. At the opera house, we enjoyed the performance of "The Magnificent Indies," created to commemorate the great French composer Rameau; at the Opera Comique, we saw Bizet's realistic opera "Carmen" with its excellent stage treatment; at the Comédie-Française, we saw Molière's masterpiece "The Bourgeois Gentleman." All of these gave us a preliminary contact with the excellent traditions of the French people in music and theatrical art.

During its performance in Paris, the Chinese Art Troupe also made many extensive and friendly contacts with various parties. From people in the cultural and artistic circles of Paris to officials of the French government in charge of foreign cultural work, all expressed their desire to further strengthen cultural relations between China and France. This wide range of friendly contacts marked a new stage in Sino-French cultural relations. The further strengthening of cultural relations between China and France will surely make a beneficial contribution to the mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.

[Note] "Paris Cheers for Beijing" is the title of a commentary on the performance of the Chinese Art Troupe in "L'Humanité," which later became a common way for the Parisian public to pay tribute to the Chinese Art Troupe.

    “巴黎欢呼北京”〔注〕
    中国艺术团副团长　赵沨
    中国艺术团参加了在巴黎举行的第二届国际戏剧节，受到热烈的欢迎。巴黎的人民和来自世界各地的戏剧家们一致盛赞中国古典戏剧艺术的光辉传统和高度水平，以及中华人民共和国成立以来在戏曲改革工作上所获得的成就。
    巴黎文化艺术界首先非常重视中国古典戏剧的高度人民性和现实主义传统。法国的名诗人罗阿说：“中华人民共和国艺术团的华丽、喜悦、机智的演出可以说是整个民族的演出，在这里描绘了民族的历史，显示了民族的情感，表现了民族的性格，蕴藏着民族的精英。”“法兰西观察家”周刊的评论说：“中国保有着最古远最丰富的戏剧艺术遗产，特点在于它的真正的社会现实性，通过戏剧，人民表达着他们共同的和个人的思想和感情。”同时，中国古典戏剧的表现形式也得到极高的评价。中国古典戏剧的概括集中和艺术夸张的手法以及动作的舞蹈化和假设性等等，对于西方的观众来说，是新颖的，但他们并不感到难以接受。正如法国的名演员格拉维所说：“最使我们惊奇的是，这是一种任何人都能了解的艺术。”法国的名作家萨特说：“语言的隔阂和习俗的不同并不发生任何的阻碍。”巴黎的艺术评论家们还大大赞美演员艺术家们的技艺。评论家们都一致推崇演员艺术家们的哑剧和武功才能，特别是动作的高度节奏感和准确性。法国名作曲家威纳说：“这是一种完全的艺术，一种美和一种惊人的准确。”舞台艺术上强烈的色彩感和高度的装饰美也引起各方面的注意。巴黎所有的报纸差不多都提到中国戏剧在舞台美术上的特点。法国的名作家特丽奥勒说：“好像万花怒放，就是乐园里百鸟展翅也比不上这服装的光彩色泽于万一。丰富的对比和近似的调和有如朝阳和彩虹。”
    巴黎的人民和巴黎的文化艺术界对中国艺术团表现了令人感动的热情。法兰西文学和艺术周刊都以数版的篇幅讨论有关中国古典戏剧的问题，电视和广播中许多次播送中国艺术团的节目，中国艺术团演出后的几天内便出版了唱片和论文集，以至时装家们都在预言着中国的舞台美术将如何影响服装的式样和色彩。“民族论坛”周刊说：“中国的文化今后将不再是学者、收藏家和旅行家的专利品及其势力范围了，由于中国戏剧给我们的启发，我们将无法就此停步的。”法国人民由于接触了中国的古典戏剧艺术，引起了对新中国的文化生活和社会生活的兴趣，汉学家们非常重视我国最近几年来在发掘、整理古典的和地方的戏曲以及民间艺术上的成就，博物馆学者以极大的兴奋来注视新中国在对文物的保护、发掘工作上的每一事件。
    巴黎的副市长奥德克洛格特别向中国艺术团表示她的祝愿：“作为和平的使节和文化的使节，我应该代表巴黎市人民和政府对你们杰出的工作表示敬意和感谢。”当代的名作家阿拉贡说：“观众对中国艺术团的热烈欢迎，表示巴黎已经承认了中华人民共和国。”
    法国的学术界、文化艺术界以及许多社会团体，也像热情好客的巴黎人民一样，对中国艺术团表示了热情的欢迎。法兰西科学院的院士们，巴黎大学、东方语言学院的教授们，法国作家全国委员会的会员们，法国最知名的演员、画家、导演、作曲家、音乐家们以及法中友好协会的朋友们，都和中国艺术团作了友好的会见，或者予以亲切的接待。法国最著名的演员菲利普在招待中国艺术团愉快的郊游中所表现的热情坦率和谦虚的美德，给予我们以深刻的印象。法国最著名的哑剧演员马索对中国艺术团表示了热烈的友情，并且专为艺术团的演员们作了表演和报告，使我们能有机会比较有系统地了解和学习欧洲的哑剧艺术，值得我们特别感谢。
    当巴黎有少数批评家以象征主义为题来讨论中国古典戏剧的时候，我们曾经为此特地拜访了法国大诗人阿拉贡和他的夫人，在他们安静的乡下别墅度过一个美丽和愉快的下午。他们肯定了中国古典戏剧在内容上和在表现方法上的高度现实主义传统，而且明确指出：说中国古典戏剧是象征主义的戏剧是一种全然的误解。以后，在他主编的法兰西文学上，连续登载了好几篇讨论中国古典戏剧现实主义传统的文章，对法国公众正确理解中国古典戏剧起了很大的作用。
    中国艺术团虽然已经告别了美丽的巴黎，但我们不能忘记国际戏剧节的主持人、名戏剧家、演员余立安对我们的热情的招待，我们也不能忘记名导演胡卢同我们的亲切的会谈和有益的建议，我们不能忘记巴黎公众在剧场中所表示的对中国古典戏剧的尊重和爱戴，我们更不能忘记在深夜守候剧场达二小时向演员致敬的巴黎市民……。所有这些热情盛意，都使我们不能忘怀。
    中国艺术团在巴黎逗留的期间，还参观了巴黎的一些著名的博物馆、罗浮宫、凡尔赛宫，接触了伟大的法兰西画派的宝藏。在歌剧院，欣赏了为了纪念伟大的法兰西作曲家拉莫所作的“豪华的印度”的演出；在喜歌剧院看了比才的现实主义的歌剧“卡尔门”的卓越的舞台处理；在法兰西喜剧院看到了莫利哀的杰作“乡村君子”。所有这些，都使我们初步地接触了法国人民在音乐、戏剧艺术上的优秀传统。
    中国艺术团在巴黎演出期间，也和各方面作了许多广泛的和友好的接触。从巴黎的文化艺术界人士到法国政府主持对外文化工作的官员，都一致表示了进一步加强中法两国文化关系的愿望。这种广泛的、友好的接触，标志着中法文化关系的一个新阶段。中法两国的文化关系的进一步加强，必将对两国人民相互了解和友好作出有益的贡献。
    〔注〕“巴黎欢呼北京”是“人道报”对中国艺术团演出评论的题目，后来变成了巴黎公众对中国艺术团致敬的共同的话。
