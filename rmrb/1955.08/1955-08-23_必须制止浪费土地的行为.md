Waste of Land Must Be Stopped
By our reporter Cao Baoming

　　The Wuhan Municipal Real Estate Administration inspected the land requisition situation of thirty-three construction units and found that many units violated the principle of economizing on land use and wasted a large amount of land. These thirty-three units requisitioned a total of more than 9,800 mu of land, of which more than 2,600 mu were left unused for a long time, nearly 27 percent of all requisitioned land; among them, more than 1,100 mu of arable land were abandoned for more than half a year, nearly 12 percent of all requisitioned land, and some were even abandoned for as long as four years. The waste caused by the expansion of the layout by various units has not been calculated.

　　The result of such waste of land is that the state has spent more than 293,000 yuan more on land requisition fees; more than 1,159,000 catties of grain have been lost; and more than 580 farmers have lost their farmland and must change careers, increasing the social burden. More seriously, it has aroused dissatisfaction among the masses of farmers. At the municipal and district people's congresses in Wuhan, and in many letters from the people, farmer representatives and the masses of farmers have severely criticized this issue.

　　The reasons for the large amount of land waste are, first of all, that some construction units pursue "high standards" in non-productive buildings and emphasize "large scale" everywhere, requesting as much land as possible when requisitioning land. When Huazhong Institute of Technology and Zhongnan Power College jointly established a school with Zhongnan Institute of Hydraulic Engineering in 1953, they applied to requisition more than 8,000 mu of land. Later, the Institute of Hydraulic Engineering changed its location, and the former Wuhan Municipal Urban Construction Committee reduced the land requisitioned by these two colleges to 2,499 mu. However, as of now, the building area of these two colleges has exceeded five times the land use standard for universities and specialized schools stipulated by the Ministry of Higher Education, and only 3.45 percent of the requisitioned land has been used. More than 400 mu of land have been left unused for a long time, of which more than 190 mu of arable land have been abandoned for two years, resulting in a loss of 198,000 catties of grain. Wuhan Workers and Peasants’ Rapid Middle School only has 500 students, but it requisitioned more than 70 mu of land, averaging 100 square meters per person, which is more than four times higher than the Soviet standard (the average land area for each student in Soviet ordinary middle schools is 15-20 square meters). They try their best to build the houses with very sparse intervals, but there are still 20 mu of arable land left unused, which has been abandoned for three years.

　　Some units have set themselves grandiose "centennial long-term plans," and they are afraid that a small amount of vacant land will affect their "development," so they deliberately occupy the land in advance. Zhongnan University of Political Science and Law and Hubei Medical College are building schools in the same area. When Zhongnan University of Political Science and Law saw that there was less vacant land in this area, it requisitioned most of the nearby farmland in advance. Since 1953, they have requisitioned a total of 160 mu of land. But so far they have only used 90 mu, and the remaining 70 mu are left unused. Their neighbor, Hubei Medical College, has increased its tasks and wants to expand its school buildings, but they still refuse to give up the idle land, which has forced Hubei Medical College to relocate. The same is true for the Logistics Department of the Central South Air Force.

　　In 1953, they demolished more than 30 residential houses and requisitioned 32 mu of land, and fenced the land with barbed wire. But so far they have only used 12 mu of land. Nearby farmers use the small pieces of land along the ditch outside the barbed wire to grow vegetables, but a large amount of farmland inside the barbed wire is covered with grass.

　　Some units request land requisition when they need land, but when the plan changes and they do not need land, they do not seriously and responsibly handle the requisitioned land. In April 1953, the Wuhan Municipal Real Estate Administration requisitioned 240 mu of land on behalf of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, preparing to build office buildings and dormitories. Later, the Municipal Party Committee decided not to build it, and allocated half of the land to the Education Bureau. The remaining 120 mu of land was not dealt with until the beginning of this year.

　　Some construction units do not requisition land in phases according to the construction situation, but simply requisition all the land at once to save trouble; some construction units' plans change frequently and are delayed, which also causes waste of land.

　　The phenomenon of large-scale land waste is also due to the fact that the organs responsible for reviewing land use—the former Wuhan Municipal Urban Construction Committee and the Wuhan Municipal Real Estate Administration—did not strictly review the construction plans of various units in accordance with the land requisition measures promulgated by the State Council. Some that should have been requisitioned in phases were allocated all at once; some that should have been used less were allocated more; some that had not even had their construction plans approved were allocated in advance; and even those without plans were allocated land.

　　According to this inspection, the Wuhan Municipal Real Estate Administration decided to seriously deal with these wasted lands separately: recover the surplus land from various units; and temporarily recover the land that is not currently used but will be used in the future, so that these lands can continue to produce grain or vegetables. At the same time, they reviewed their past mistakes of not adhering to principles, and decided to improve the review system, strengthen inspection work, and correctly implement the principle of economizing on land use. However, when the Wuhan Municipal Real Estate Administration requested various units to return the excessively occupied land, they encountered many difficulties. For example, Factory 201 refused to return the 30 mu of land that had been requisitioned since 1951, on the grounds that they were going to plant trees on this land. Who can give a factory the task of cultivating 30 mu of forest in the city? Obviously, this is an excuse for them not wanting to save land. Wuhan Workers and Peasants' Rapid Middle School also refused to return the excessively requisitioned 20 mu of land, on the grounds that they also wanted to build exhibition halls, clubs, gardens, bathhouses, and school buildings. Who approved the plan? It turned out that it was just the school principal's own plan. The above examples show that some units still do not attach importance to economizing on land use. They do not understand that the construction scale of our country's first five-year plan is very huge, and a large amount of land needs to be requisitioned. If the phenomenon of waste in land requisition is not eliminated, it will inevitably cause significant losses to the country and will affect our country's foundation—the worker-peasant alliance. When the people of the whole country are practicing comprehensive economy for the construction of socialism, the phenomenon of land waste must not be allowed to continue. All land-using units must criticize their own erroneous ideas and immediately correct the behavior of wasting land.

　　必须制止浪费土地的行为
　　本报记者　曹葆铭
    武汉市房地产管理局检查了三十三个建设单位征用土地的情况，发现有许多单位违反节约用地的原则，浪费了大量土地。这三十三个单位一共征用了九千八百多亩土地，长期闲置不用的就有二千六百多亩，将近全部征用土地的百分之二十七；其中荒芜半年以上的耕地有一千一百多亩，将近全部征用土地的百分之十二，有的甚至荒芜达四年之久。至于各单位扩大平面布置所造成的浪费，还没有计算在内。
    这样浪费土地的结果是：使国家多开支了二十九万三千多元征用土地的费用；少出产了一百一十五万九千多斤粮食；使五百八十多个农民失去耕地，必须转业，增加了社会负担。更严重的是引起了农民群众的不满。在武汉市的市、区代表大会上，在许多人民来信中，农民代表和农民群众都对这个问题提出了严厉的批评。
    造成大量浪费土地的原因，首先是有些建设单位在非生产性建筑中追求“高标准”，处处强调“大规模”，征用土地时要求越多越好。华中工学院和中南动力学院在一九五三年同中南水利学院联合建校时，竟申请征用土地八千多亩。后来水利学院另换地点，前武汉市城市建设委员会将这两个学院的征用土地削减为二千四百九十九亩。但是，截至目前为止，这两个学院的建筑物占地面积，按高等教育部规定的高等学校和专科学校学生用地标准计算，已超过了五倍，而所征用的土地才只使用了百分之三点四五，有四百多亩土地长期闲置不用，其中有一百九十多亩耕地已荒芜了两年，少生产十九万八千斤粮食。武汉工农速成中学仅有学生五百人，却征用了七十多亩土地，平均每人占地一百平方公尺，比苏联标准还高出四倍多（苏联的普通中学平均每个学生用地面积为十五—二十平方公尺）。他们尽量把房子建筑得间隔很稀，但至今仍然有二十亩耕地闲置没用，已经荒芜了三年。
    有些单位给自己规定了规模宏大的“百年远景计划”，他们怕空地少会影响自己的“发展”，便故意事先占用土地。中南政法学院和湖北省医学院在同一地区建校。中南政法学院看见这块地方空地较少，就事先征用了附近的大部分农地。从一九五三年起，他们共陆续征用了一百六十亩土地。但是至今他们只用了九十亩，余下七十亩都闲置起来。他们的邻居——湖北医学院任务加大，要扩建校舍，他们仍不肯把闲置的土地让出来，结果使得湖北医学院被迫搬迁。中南空军后勤部也是这样。
  一九五三年，他们拆迁了三十多栋民房，征用了三十二亩土地，并且用铁丝网把地圈了起来。但是他们至今只使用了十二亩地，附近农民利用铁丝网外的小块沟边隙地种菜，但铁丝网内的大量耕地却长满了青草。
    还有的单位当自己需要土地时便请求征用土地，而当计划变更不需用土地时，却不认真负责地处理所征用的土地。一九五三年四月，武汉市房地产管理局代中共武汉市委员会征用了二百四十亩土地，准备修建办公大楼和宿舍。后来市委决定不修建了，把一半土地拨给了教育局，剩下的一百二十亩土地一直拖到今年年初才处理。
    还有的建设单位不按施工情况分期征用土地，而是贪图省事，把全部土地一次征用了；有的建设单位计划时常变化，拖延不决，也造成了土地的浪费。
    造成大量浪费土地的现象，还由于负责审查用地的机关——前武汉市城市建设委员会和武汉市房地产管理局没有遵照国务院颁布的土地征用办法，严格审查各单位的建设计划。一些该分期征用的，他们一次拨给了；一些该少用的，他们多拨了；一些连建设计划都还未批准的，他们也先期拨给了；甚至没有计划的，他们也拨给了土地。
    根据这次检查，武汉市房地产管理局决定对这些浪费的土地分别认真处理：将各单位多余的土地收回；将现时不用而将来要用的土地也暂时收回，使这些土地能继续生产粮食或蔬菜。他们同时检讨了过去没有坚持原则的错误，决定健全审查制度，加强检查工作，正确贯彻节约用地的原则。但是，当武汉市房地产管理局要求各单位退出多占用的土地时，却遇到很多困难。例如，二○一工厂就不肯退出从一九五一年以来多征用了的三十亩土地，理由是准备在这片土地上种树。谁能给一个工厂在市区里培植三十亩树林的任务呢？很显然，这是他们不愿节约土地的借口。武汉工农速成中学也不肯退出多征用的二十亩土地，理由是他们还要修建陈列馆、俱乐部、花园、浴池和校舍。谁批准的计划呢？原来只是该校校长自己这样打算。上述这些例子说明，有些单位至今还没有重视节约用地。他们不明白：我们国家第一个五年计划的建设规模非常巨大，需要征用大量的土地，如果征用土地中的浪费现象不消灭，就必然会给国家造成重大损失，并且会影响我们国家的基础——工农联盟。当全国人民正为建设社会主义而厉行全面节约的时候，绝不允许浪费土地的现象继续存在。各用地单位必须批判自己的错误思想，立即纠正浪费土地的行为。
