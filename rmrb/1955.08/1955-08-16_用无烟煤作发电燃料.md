    Using Anthracite as Fuel for Power Generation
    Recently, the affiliated power plant of a cement factory in Fujian Province experimented with anthracite as industrial fuel. The experiment proved that the generator can use various proportions of anthracite and bituminous coal mixed together as fuel under different loads. Because anthracite is available locally, the factory no longer uses all bituminous coal from Huainan, Anhui, saving the state 150,000 yuan per year.
    Northwestern Fujian Province has abundant anthracite reserves. In the past, although a large amount was mined, it was rarely used as industrial fuel. This experiment conducted by the factory's employees in the production increase and economy campaign has created conditions for power plants in Fujian to fully utilize the province's cheap anthracite resources in the future, and has opened up a broad sales market for the Lishan and Longyan coal mines that have already been mined.

    用无烟煤作发电燃料
    福建省一个水泥厂的附属电厂最近试用了无烟煤作工业燃料。这一试验证明，发电机在不同的负载下可用各种不同比例的无烟煤和烟煤混合起来作为燃料。由于就地可取得无烟煤，这个厂不再全部使用安徽淮南的烟煤，每年可为国家节约十五万元。
    福建省西北部无烟煤蕴藏量丰富，过去虽有大量开采，但很少被利用为工业燃料。这个厂职工在增产节约运动中所作的这一试验，为福建各地电厂今后充分利用省内廉价的无烟煤资源创造了条件，并且给已经开采的梨山、龙岩煤矿打开了广阔的销路。（新华社）
