　　US Agricultural Dumping Crisis in Asia
　　Dù Bō
　　The United States has been suffering from a severe agricultural crisis for several years. American monopoly capital has a large amount of agricultural products that cannot find a market. Even according to official US statistics, the total value of agricultural products currently owned or held as loan collateral in the United States has reached $7.5 billion, and $700,000 has to be paid daily for warehouse storage to keep these unsold agricultural products. The severity of the US agricultural crisis is also clearly reflected in the US government's forced reduction of planting areas. This practice of reducing cultivated land has now expanded to major crops such as wheat, rice, corn, cotton, and tobacco, peanuts. The cultivated area for wheat has been reduced by 30%, the cultivated area for rice has been reduced by 25%, and the cultivated area for cotton has been reduced by 19.3%. The reduction of cultivated area is to tighten the supply, so as to sell agricultural products at monopolistic high prices and ensure high profits for capitalists.
　　The reason for the US agricultural product "surplus" is not that the needs of the American people for agricultural products have been fully met, nor, as the US government claims, that farmers are overproducing, but because of the shrinking domestic consumer market and the decline in agricultural product exports. Millions of American working people are struggling to make ends meet under the burden of military expansion and war preparations. They do not have the money to buy enough food for themselves and their families. Nationwide, the average food consumption of Americans in 1954 decreased by 19% compared to 1935 to 1939. On September 6, 1954, the American "Capital Times" published a letter from an American farmer. He said: "We do not have overproduction, but reduced consumption. Millions of people are starving, while millionaires are getting fatter and fatter."
　　In order to pursue maximum profits, American monopoly capital has adopted a policy of dumping surplus agricultural products abroad. In the first few years after World War II, because agricultural production in many countries around the world was destroyed in the war and had not yet recovered, the United States reaped huge profits by exporting agricultural products. However, in recent years, agricultural production in many countries has recovered or improved, which has drastically deteriorated the export situation of American agricultural products. In the past three years, US agricultural exports have decreased by 30%. Especially Western European countries, due to the recovery of agricultural production and the shortage of US dollar foreign exchange, have been demanding less and less American agricultural products year by year, which has seriously hit the US policy of dumping agricultural products in Western Europe. Although the United States has adopted various methods such as agricultural product export subsidies, economic "aid", and payment in the currency of importing countries, it has not been able to make its sales plan a big success.
　　In this situation, the United States is stepping up the dumping of large quantities of surplus agricultural products to Asian countries. In Japan alone, the United States sells 3 million to 4 million tons of surplus grain every year. The United States also transports large quantities of cotton, grain, and soybeans to Asian countries as military "aid" goods. A large part of the US military assistance to South Korea, Taiwan, South Vietnam, Cambodia, etc. is this type of surplus agricultural product.
　　In addition to these methods, the United States also uses its "position of strength" to force some Asian countries to sign so-called surplus agricultural product agreements, and forcibly dump US surplus agricultural products into the markets of these countries. In 1954, the United States used this method to dump large quantities of grain in Japan and South Korea; in May of this year, it signed new surplus agricultural product agreements with Japan and South Korea. According to the new agreement, the United States will dump surplus agricultural products worth 85 million US dollars in Japan and 15 million US dollars in South Korea this year. The US "Foreign Operations Administration" in the Philippines decided in November 1954 to dump 50 million US dollars of surplus grain in the Philippines, and this year it will force the Philippines to accept surplus agricultural products worth 22.2 million US dollars. In addition, the United States has promoted 29 million US dollars of agricultural products in Pakistan and 9.4 million US dollars of wheat, rice, and cotton in Israel, using the method of payment in the currency of the importing country, and sold 28.6 million US dollars of surplus wheat and feed in Turkey. The United States has also exported a large amount of agricultural products to other Asian countries.
　　The US dumping of surplus agricultural products in Asia, on the one hand, is to alleviate the domestic agricultural crisis, but also serves its military strategic goals. The United States uses its surplus agricultural products to plunder strategic materials from Asian countries and force Asian countries to implement military expansion and war preparations. The US "Surplus Agricultural Products Disposal Act" stipulates that the funds obtained from the sale of surplus agricultural products must be used to purchase strategic raw materials and war equipment. For example, the United States used surplus agricultural products to exchange for tungsten and manganese from South Korea, and manganese ore and chromite from Turkey. In January of this year, the United States signed an agreement with Japan to exchange US wheat for Japanese war equipment, stipulating that Japan would use the funds from the sale of wheat to re-equip factories to manufacture guns, ammunition, and repair American jet aircraft. The new surplus agricultural product agreements signed by the United States with Japan and South Korea this year stipulate that the United States will treat surplus agricultural products as loans to Japan and South Korea, but they can only use these funds for military purposes.
　　The US dumping of surplus agricultural products in Asia transfers its own agricultural crisis to some Asian countries, seriously hindering the development of agricultural production in these countries and hitting their economies. The Philippines is a well-known producer of Luzon tobacco leaves, but the United States this year is forcing it to accept American tobacco leaves worth 19 million US dollars; Pakistan has a large amount of cotton that cannot find a market, and the United States has forced it to import American cotton worth more than 21 million US dollars in the past ten months ending June 30 of this year. As a result, a large amount of tobacco leaves and cotton in these countries are overstocked, threatening many tobacco farmers and cotton farmers with bankruptcy. The US import of large quantities of grain to Japan has resulted in a sharp drop in grain prices in Japan, and Japanese farmers are now fighting to protect grain prices. Japan's "Economist" weekly pointed out in its commentary on the US dumping of surplus agricultural products to Japan on December 18 last year: "Japan, as an import market for US surplus agricultural products, is being more and more tightly bound. This makes Japanese agriculture gradually become a colonial-style appendage of American agriculture, and the status and role of agriculture in the national economy is becoming increasingly deformed." The magazine also said that the import of US agricultural products has reduced the amount of grain Japan imports from Asian countries. Because these countries have to export grain to Japan in order to buy more Japanese goods, this hinders the expansion of Japan's export trade, thereby increasing the difficulty of Japan's balance of international payments.
　　The US dumping of large quantities of grain to Asian countries has seriously hit the foreign trade and economic life of major Asian rice exporting countries such as Myanmar and Thailand. Rice accounts for more than 70% of the total exports of Myanmar and Thailand. The vast majority of people in both countries rely on rice production and trade for their livelihoods, and the country's finances also depend on rice exports. Japan and Southeast Asian countries are their traditional rice export markets. Since the United States began large-scale dumping of surplus grain in Asian countries in 1953, rice exports from Myanmar and Thailand have been severely squeezed. Currently, the unsold rice in both countries is more than one million tons. In particular, Thailand is also being forced by the United States to expand its military and prepare for war, and is prohibited from conducting normal trade with peaceful and democratic countries. Its economic situation is very serious, and the fiscal deficit cannot be made up.
　　In order to monopolize the Asian grain market and further squeeze out the rice export trade of Myanmar and Thailand, the United States not long ago sent a so-called rice inspection team to Myanmar and Thailand to conduct activities, attempting to establish a "temporary agreement" with Myanmar and Thailand to devalue and dump grain, so that it could dump more surplus grain into the Asian market. The Myanmar government resolutely rejected the US proposal. The Thai government also did not agree to the US request because of opposition from the domestic people and public opinion.
　　The US dumping of agricultural products in Asia also harms the interests of other countries in the world that export agricultural products, such as Australia and Canada, and hinders the normal trade and development of agricultural production in these countries.
　　The United States is using the dumping of agricultural products as a means to develop its colonial power in Asia. The US News & World Report magazine published a conversation with US Secretary of Agriculture Benson on October 8 last year, saying:
　　"I think food is a very powerful weapon. I don't think we have fully used it and its role. I hope to see more food shipped overseas." Therefore, the US policy of dumping agricultural products has been opposed by the people of Asian countries. In the struggle against the US dumping of the agricultural crisis, many Asian countries and people are increasingly aware of the importance of equal and mutually beneficial economic cooperation among Asian countries and the development of their respective national economies. Myanmar's normal trade with China and the Soviet Union has alleviated the difficulty of Myanmar's rice sales. Now, public opinion in countries such as Thailand and the Philippines is also increasingly aware that it is beneficial for them to get rid of US economic control and conduct equal and mutually beneficial trade with China. Facts have proved that developing economic cooperation among Asian countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit is the correct path for the economic development and prosperity of all Asian countries.

　　美国在亚洲倾销农业危机
　　杜波
    美国遭受严重的农业危机已经有好几年了。美国垄断资本有着大量的农产品找不到销路。即使根据美国官方的统计，目前美国拥有或作为贷款抵押品持有的农产品总值已达七十五亿美元，每天得付出七十万美元的仓库储存费来保管这些滞销的农产品。美国农业危机的严重情况，还鲜明地反映在美国政府强迫缩减播种面积的做法上。这种缩减耕地面积的做法，现在已经扩展到小麦、稻谷、玉蜀黍、棉花、烟草、花生等主要农作物。小麦的耕种面积缩减了百分之三十，稻谷的耕种面积减少了百分之二十五，棉花的耕种面积减少了百分之十九点三。缩减耕种面积，是为了紧缩货源，以便把农产品以垄断的高价推销出去，保证资本家的高额利润。
    美国农产品“过剩”的原因，并不是美国人民对农产品的需要已得到充分的满足，也不是如美国政府所说的是农民生产过多，而是因为国内消费市场萎缩和农产品出口下降。美国千百万劳动人民在扩军备战的重担下，入不敷出，他们没有钱来为自己和他的家庭购买足够的粮食。就全国范围说，美国人民在一九五四年的粮食平均消费量，比一九三五年到一九三九年减少了百分之十九。一九五四年九月六日美国“首府时报”发表了一封美国农民的信。他说：“我们并没有生产过剩，而是消费量减少了。千百万人在挨饿，而百万富翁们却越来越肥。”
    美国垄断资本为追求最大限度的利润，采取了向国外倾销剩余农产品的政策。在第二次大战后的头几年，由于世界许多国家的农业生产在战争中遭到破坏，还没有恢复，美国靠输出农产品攫取了大量利润。但是，近年来许多国家的农业生产都已经恢复或提高，这就使得美国的农产品出口状况急剧恶化。最近三年来，美国农产品出口减少了百分之三十。特别是西欧国家，由于农业生产的恢复，美元外汇的缺少，对美国农产品的需求量一年比一年减少，这严重地打击了美国在西欧倾销农产品的政策。美国虽然采取农产品出口补贴、经济“援助”、用进口国货币付款等种种办法，也不能使它的销售计划有大的起色。
    在这种情况下，美国加紧把大量剩余农产品向亚洲国家倾销。仅在日本，美国每年就销售了三百万吨到四百万吨的剩余粮食。美国还把大量棉花、粮食、大豆作为军“援”物品输送到亚洲国家。美国对南朝鲜、台湾、南越、柬埔寨等等的军事援助中，就有很大一部分是这类剩余农产品。
    除了这些办法外，美国并利用它的“实力地位”，强迫一些亚洲国家同它签订所谓剩余农产品协定，硬把美国的剩余农产品倾销到这些国家的市场上。一九五四年，美国用这种办法在日本和南朝鲜倾销了大量粮食；今年五月间又同日本和南朝鲜签订了新的剩余农产品协定。根据新的协定，美国今年将在日本倾销价值八千五百万美元的剩余农产品，在南朝鲜倾销价值一千五百万美元的农产品。美国驻菲律宾的“援外事务管理署”在一九五四年十一月决定在菲律宾倾销五千万美元的剩余粮食，今年又要强迫菲律宾接受价值二千二百万美元剩余农产品。此外，美国用进口国家货币付款的办法，在巴基斯坦推销了二千九百万美元的农产品，在以色列倾销了价值九百四十万美元的小麦、大米、棉花，在土耳其销售了二千八百六十万美元的剩余小麦和饲料。美国对其他亚洲国家也输出了大量农产品。
    美国在亚洲倾销剩余农产品，一方面是缓和国内农业危机，但同时也服务于它的军事战略目的。美国利用它的剩余农产品，掠夺亚洲国家的战略物资，并强迫亚洲国家实行扩军备战。美国的“剩余农产品处理法案”规定，销售剩余农产品所得的资金，得用以购买战略原料和战争装备。例如，美国用剩余农产品换取了南朝鲜的钨和锰，土耳其的锰矿砂和铬矿砂。今年一月，美国同日本签订了一项用美国小麦交换日本战争装备的协定，规定日本用这项售卖小麦的资金重新装备工厂以制造枪炮、子弹和修理美国喷气飞机。美国同日本和南朝鲜今年签订的新的剩余农产品协定，规定美国把剩余农产品作为给日本和南朝鲜的贷款，但它们都只能把这些款项用于军事目的。
    美国在亚洲倾销剩余农产品，把它自己的农业危机转嫁给亚洲一些国家，严重地阻碍了这些国家农业生产的发展，打击了它们的经济。菲律宾是有名的吕宋烟叶出产国家，美国在今年却要强迫它接受价值一千九百万美元的美国烟叶；巴基斯坦有大量棉花找不到销路，美国在到本年六月三十日止的过去十个月中强迫它输入了价值二千一百多万美元的美国棉花。结果使这些国家的烟叶和棉花大量积压，使许多烟农和棉农遭受破产的威胁。美国把大量粮食输入日本的结果，使日本粮食价格大跌，现在日本农民正为保障粮食价格进行斗争。日本“经济学人”周刊去年十二月十八日在评论美国向日本倾销剩余农产品时指出：“日本作为美国过剩农产品的输入市场，被更进一层地紧紧束缚住。这就使日本农业渐渐变成美国农业的殖民地式的附庸，农业在国民经济中的地位和作用越来越畸形化。”这个杂志还说，美国农产品的输入减少了日本从亚洲国家输入粮食的数量。由于这些国家要向日本出口粮食才能多购买日本的货物，这就妨碍了日本出口贸易的扩大，从而增加了日本国际收支平衡的困难。
    美国把大量粮食向亚洲国家倾销，严重地打击了亚洲主要大米输出国家如缅甸和泰国的对外贸易和经济生活。缅甸和泰国的大米都占它们出口总值的百分之七十以上，两国绝大多数人民都是依靠大米的生产和贸易为生，国家的财政也要依靠大米出口来维持。日本和东南亚国家是它们输出大米的传统市场。从一九五三年美国在亚洲国家开始大规模倾销剩余粮食以来，缅甸和泰国的大米出口遭到严重的排挤。现在，两国滞销的大米都在一百万吨以上。特别是泰国，还被美国强迫扩军备战，禁止同和平民主国家进行正常贸易，它的经济情况非常严重，财政赤字无法弥补。
    美国为了要独占亚洲的粮食市场，进一步排挤缅甸和泰国的大米出口贸易，不久以前派遣了一个所谓大米考察团到缅甸和泰国进行活动，企图同缅甸和泰国成立贬价倾销粮食的“临时协定”，以便它把更多的剩余粮食倾销到亚洲的市场上来。缅甸政府坚决拒绝了美国的建议。泰国政府也因为由于国内人民和舆论的反对，没有答应美国的要求。
    美国在亚洲倾销农产品，同样危害了世界其他有农产品输出的国家如澳大利亚、加拿大的利益，阻碍了这些国家的正常贸易和农业生产的发展。
    美国是把倾销农产品作为它在亚洲发展殖民势力的手段的。“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志去年十月八日发表的美国农业部长本逊的谈话就说：
  “我认为粮食是一种威力强大的武器。我不以为我们已经充分使用了它和发挥了它的作用。我希望看到将有更多的粮食运往海外。”因此，美国倾销农产品的政策，遭到亚洲国家人民的反对。亚洲许多国家和人民在反对美国倾销农业危机的斗争中，越来越清楚地认识到亚洲国家平等互利进行经济合作，发展各自国家经济的重要意义。缅甸同中国和苏联进行正常贸易，减轻了缅甸大米销售的困难。现在泰国和菲律宾这些国家的舆论，也日益认识到摆脱美国的经济控制，同中国进行平等互利的贸易，对它们是有利的。事实证明，只有在平等互利的基础上发展亚洲国家间的经济合作，才是亚洲一切国家经济发展和繁荣的正确途径。
