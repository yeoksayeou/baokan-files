Tricks in the Glare of Cups and Shadows of Wine
		Zeng Wenjing

    Just when the people of the whole country are carrying forward the spirit of hard struggle and making the greatest efforts for socialist construction, the lives of some capitalists have changed greatly: indulging in sensual pleasures and extreme extravagance! A capitalist in Dezhou leaves his business alone and drinks six times a day, often saying with drunken eyes: "General Line, give me four liang! Industrialization, another four liang!" Xiao Ruisen, the capital representative of the Beijing Quanye Market, gathered more than 40 large and small merchants for extravagant eating and drinking. They also said with a sarcastic tone: "I didn't expect the Communist Party's leadership to be so good, the merchants in Quanye Market have never been so lively!" A capitalist from a Shanghai velvet factory bought foreign houses, cars, and traveled around, spending 480,000 yuan at once! A capitalist from a hardware store in the city spent more than 30,000 yuan on dance girls! The shopkeepers of a hardware store in Tianjin launched a "spending competition": the second and fifth shopkeepers claimed to be sick and stayed in the hospital, getting tonic shots and taking tonic medicine, spending more than 1,000 yuan a month. The third shopkeeper took 1,800 yuan to the street to spend recklessly. ...

    Why are capitalists suddenly spending so lavishly? Where did they get so much money? As long as we investigate the details, we will find that most of the money these capitalists squander is secretly withdrawn funds. After investigating 137 factories and stores in the Xuanwu and Qianmen districts of Beijing in industries such as department stores and ironwork, it was found that 58 of them had secretly withdrawn funds.

    After a large amount of funds was withdrawn, the factories were in desperate straits, wage arrears became widespread, and workers were largely unemployed. Last October, about a quarter of the 125 industrial and commercial households in Shanghai's Xincheng District that had funds withdrawn had difficulty in cash flow, and 10 households had completely stopped production. In the third quarter of last year, the amount of wages owed to workers by capitalists in Shenyang reached 2.87 million yuan. Many workers were forced to borrow here and there and sell their clothes to maintain their lives because they could not get their wages.

    The behavior of capitalists in withdrawing funds and spending lavishly is not only a matter of wasting social wealth and violating the spirit of practicing thrift, but also a matter of violating the law.

    Our country's constitution has long stipulated that the state protects the capitalist's ownership of the means of production and other capital ownership in accordance with the law. The profits obtained by capitalists in compliance with the law are originally a legitimate income. This income, like the ownership of various means of livelihood, is protected by the constitution.

    However, these capitalists are not obtaining legitimate income from the profits of the enterprise, but are withdrawing funds to ruin the factory, which directly affects national production and causes social unemployment. This is an attempt to resist the state's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and an attempt to undermine our great socialist construction cause, which is a criminal act.

    Obviously, this behavior is very vicious! Its essence is an extremely malicious means for the bourgeoisie to attack the working class!

    These capitalists should be warned: your behavior is violating the fundamental law of the country! The constitution stipulates that the state should gradually complete the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, stipulates that "the state prohibits all illegal acts of capitalists that endanger public interests, disrupt social and economic order, and undermine national economic plans," and stipulates that "the state prohibits anyone from using private property to undermine public interests." But you secretly withdraw funds, squander waste, undermine production, create poverty and unemployment, disrupt social and economic life, undermine national economic plans, and resist socialist transformation. The people and the national law do not allow your practice.

    杯光酒影里的鬼把戏
    曾文经
    正当全国人民发扬艰苦奋斗精神，为社会主义建设尽最大努力的时候，有些资本家的生活却大大地变了样：花天酒地，穷奢极欲！德州有个资本家，放下业务不管，每天喝酒六次，常常醉眼惺忪地说：“总路线，来四两！工业化，再来四两！”北京劝业场资方代表萧瑞森纠集大小商户四十多人，大吃大喝。他们还带着讽刺的口吻说：“想不到共产党领导有这么大的好处，劝业场商人从来没有这样热闹过！”上海某毛绒厂的资本家买洋房、汽车、到各地游玩，一下就花了四十八万元！该市某五金店资本家，花在舞女身上，竟达三万多元之多！天津某五金店掌柜们开展了“花钱竞赛”：二掌柜、五掌柜称病住在医院里，打补针，吃补药，每月花一千多元。三掌柜拿了一千八百元到街上去胡花。……
    为什么资本家忽然这样大事挥霍？他们从哪里弄来这么多钱呢？只要查一查底细，我们就会发现，这些资本家挥霍的，大部分是偷偷抽出来的资金。北京市调查了宣武、前门两区百货、铁工等行业一百三十七家工厂商店后，就发现其中有五十八户被暗中抽走资金。
    大量资金被抽走之后，工厂就陷于绝境，拖欠工资的现象普遍发生，工人大量失业了。去年十月，上海新成区被抽走资金的一百二十五个工商业户中，就约有四分之一资金周转困难，有十户生产完全停顿。去年第三季度，沈阳市资本家拖欠工人工资竟达二百八十七万元之多。工人因拿不到工资，被迫东挪西借，变卖衣物维持生活的很多。
    资本家这种抽走资金、大事挥霍的行为不仅是一个浪费社会财富、违背厉行节约精神的问题，而且是一个违法的问题。
    我国宪法早已规定，国家依照法律保护资本家的生产资料所有权和其他资本所有权。资本家在遵守法律的条件下取得的利润，本来是一种合法收入。这种收入是和各种生活资料所有权一样，受到宪法的保护的。
    但是，这些资本家不是从企业利润中取得合法收入，而是抽去资金搞垮工厂，这就直接影响国家生产，造成社会失业，这是企图抗拒国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，企图破坏我国伟大的社会主义建设事业的犯罪行为。
    显然，这种行为是非常毒辣的！它本质上是资产阶级向工人阶级进攻的一种极其恶毒的手段！
    应该警告这些资本家：你们这种行为是违反国家根本大法的！宪法规定国家要逐步完成对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，规定“国家禁止资本家的危害公共利益、扰乱社会经济秩序、破坏国家经济计划的一切非法行为”，规定“国家禁止任何人利用私有财产破坏公共利益”，你们却要暗中抽走资金、挥霍浪费、破坏生产、制造贫困和失业现象、扰乱社会经济生活、破坏国家经济计划、抗拒社会主义改造。你们这种做法，人民和国法是不容许的。
