Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th - According to Vietnam News Agency: The International Commission for Vietnam has reached a conclusion regarding the incident of the French Federal Forces illegally transporting aircraft engines and carburetors into Saigon on October 5, 1954. The conclusion points out that France violated the Vietnam Ceasefire Agreement twice in this incident.

The conclusion states that on October 5, 1954, eleven boxes were secretly unloaded from the ship "Vietnam," ten of which contained aircraft engines and one contained aircraft carburetors. In response to the Commission's letter of December 29, 1954, the French Federal Forces stated that "none of these engines were usable at the time" and indicated that the engines could be inspected. The International Commission's permanent inspection team in Saigon repeatedly requested the French Liaison Delegation in Saigon to provide facilities for inspecting these engines. However, on March 25, 1955, these engines were shipped out of Vietnam again by the warship "Vinh Thanh Bay," and it was not until May 24 that the French side submitted the export notification to the Commission.

The International Commission pointed out in its conclusion: "The Commission, after carefully considering this matter from all aspects, believes that the Commander-in-Chief of the French Federal Forces' failure to notify the International Commission or its sub-group about the import of these engines and carburetors is not in accordance with the provisions of Article 17 of the Geneva Accords."

The International Commission further stated: "The Commander-in-Chief of the French Federal Forces allowing these engines to be shipped out without allowing the Commission to verify, through its sub-group, that the engines imported on October 5 were indeed not in a usable state, is considered by the Commission to be inconsistent with the spirit of Article 17 of the Geneva Accords."

    就法方非法把军事物资运入西贡事件
    越南国际委员会指出法方违反停战协定
    新华社河内七日电　据越南通讯社讯：越南国际委员会就法兰西联邦部队方面在一九五四年十月五日把飞机引擎和汽化器非法运入西贡一事作出了结论，结论指出，法方在这个事件中两次违反了越南停战协定。
    结论说，一九五四年十月五日从“越南号”轮船暗中卸下了十一个箱子，其中十箱装着飞机引擎，一箱装着飞机用汽化器。法兰西联邦部队方面在回答委员会一九五四年十二月二十九日的信件时说，“当时这些引擎没有一个是可以使用的”，并且表示可以检查这些引擎。国际委员会驻西贡的固定视察小组向驻西贡法方联络代表团一再提出要求，要它提供检查这些引擎的便利。但是在一九五五年三月二十五日，这些引擎又由“温汉湾号”军舰从越南运出，而到五月二十四日，法方才把这个出口通知送交委员会。
    国际委员会在结论中指出：“委员会从各方面仔细考虑了这件事，认为法兰西联邦部队总司令部没有通知国际委员会或委员会所属小组关于运入这些引擎和汽化器的事情，是同日内瓦协定第十七条的规定不符合的。”
    国际委员会又说：“法兰西联邦部队总司令部允许这些引擎运出，而不让委员会通过它的小组来检查在十月五日运入的这些引擎确实不处于可用状态，委员会认为这种行动是不符合于日内瓦协定第十七条的精神的。”
