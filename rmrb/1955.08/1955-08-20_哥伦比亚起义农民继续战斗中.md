Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, August 16th: The Colombian peasant uprising, which broke out at the end of last year to demand land reform, is continuing. In various regions, armed peasants are constantly clashing with government troops sent to suppress the uprising. The peasant uprisings in the provinces of Tolima, Huila, Cauca Valley, and Caldas are particularly acute.

Recently, the struggle in the Villarrica area has intensified, where more than 100,000 peasants working on coffee plantations live. More than 5,000 government troops, equipped with rifles, machine guns, and artillery, have been deployed there to deal with the peasants.

According to the Brazilian "People's Daily," tens of thousands of residents in the Villarrica area have been displaced due to the offensive by government troops. Thousands of peasants have died in brutal battles with government troops. Many peasants have been imprisoned.

Committees have been established in many parts of the country to fight for the release of imprisoned peasants and to stop the acts of terror.

According to the Colombian government, the government troops have suffered heavy losses due to the tenacious resistance of the peasants.

    哥伦比亚起义农民继续战斗中
    新华社十七日讯　据塔斯社蒙得维的亚十六日讯：去年年底为了要求实行土地改革而爆发的哥伦比亚农民起义仍在继续中。在各地区，武装的农民不断和政府派来镇压起义的军队发生冲突。托里马、维拉、考卡山谷、卡尔达斯各省农民起义具有特别尖锐的性质。
    最近，维里亚里卡区的斗争加剧了，那里住有在咖啡种植园工作的农民十万多人。配备有步枪、机枪和大炮的政府军队五千多人被调到那里去对付农民。
    据巴西“人民报”报道，由于政府军队的进攻，维里亚里卡区已有数万居民流离失所。数千农民在同政府军队进行残酷的战斗中死亡。许多农民被关进了监狱。
    国内许多地区成立了委员会，为争取释放被囚的农民、制止恐怖行动而斗争。
    据哥伦比亚政府方面承认，由于农民的顽强抵抗，政府军队遭到很大的损失。
