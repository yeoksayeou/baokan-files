Forestry Industry Department Should Vigorously Conserve Fuel

To the Editor:

    In the forestry industry sector, with the increasing mechanization of timber transport and logging operations, the demand for fuels such as coal and diesel is increasing. However, the issue of fuel conservation has not attracted the attention of all forestry industry departments.

    Many units are misusing high-quality coal and imported oil, without regard to actual needs. For example, the Weihe Forestry Bureau has consistently used Hengshan coal, which is in line with the regulated flow, for its locomotives over the years, but now demands to switch to Hegang coal. The Arxan, Wangqing, and Bajiazi Forestry Bureaus have also repeatedly requested the use of high-quality coal exceeding the regulated flow as locomotive fuel. In the entire forestry industry sector, the annual use of coal exceeding the regulated flow amounts to one-fifth of the total annual coal consumption. There are similar phenomena in the use of oil. According to the climatic conditions in Northeast China, domestic diesel can generally be used; in the colder Inner Mongolia region, domestic diesel can also be used completely, except during the winter and early spring. However, the forestry bureaus in these regions demand to use Soviet No. 1 diesel throughout the year; the Inner Mongolia Forestry Administration’s application for imported diesel in the third quarter accounts for more than 90% of the entire quarter. Due to the misuse of high-quality coal and imported oil exceeding the regulated flow, the cost of timber is estimated to increase by about 700,000 yuan this year.

    Coal for heating is also a very serious waste. The annual coal consumption for heating in the forestry industry sector accounts for nearly 30% of the total coal consumption, and individual units even use high-quality coal exceeding the regulated flow for heating. In fact, most units can replace heating coal with wood billets (billets split from decayed and substandard timber). If this can be done, it can save the state more than 40,000 tons of coal this year.

    In addition, there are false phenomena in the fuel consumption quotas of many forestry bureaus. For example, the consumption quota for locomotive coal is only determined based on how much coal is burned per kilometer traveled, rather than based on how much heat is required per kilometer, how much standard fuel is consumed, and how much natural coal is converted. Therefore, the consumption quota is generally high, wasting fuel.

    It should be pointed out that some units have already begun to pay attention to fuel conservation and have achieved some results. For example, the employees of the Dashitou and Huangnihe Forestry Bureaus paid attention to improving operating techniques and storage methods last year, and insisted on using low-quality coal as much as possible under the condition of not affecting production. As a result, they used more than 10,000 tons less of high-quality coal, saving nearly 90,000 yuan in Renminbi (excluding the special freight rates for transportation exceeding the regulated flow). For example, the Harbin Forestry Administration mobilized employees to discuss the plan for the second half of this year, and the average fuel consumption quota was reduced by about 10%. Among them, locomotive coal was reduced by 9%, reducing more than 4,500 tons. It is hoped that other units in the forestry industry sector can also vigorously carry out fuel conservation work.

### 森林工业部门应该大力节约燃料

    森林工业部门应该大力节约燃料编辑同志：
    在森林工业部门中，随着运材、伐木作业机械化比重的增大，煤炭、柴油等燃料的需要量日益增加。但是，节约燃料的问题，还没有引起所有森林工业部门的注意。
    不少单位不根据实际需要滥用优质煤和进口油料。例如，苇河森林工业局历年机车用煤都是合乎规定流向的恒山煤，现在却要求改用鹤岗煤。阿尔山、汪清、八家子等森林工业局也一再要求使用超流向的优质煤作为机车燃料。在整个森林工业部门中，每年的超流向用煤竟达全年用煤量的五分之一。在使用油料方面也有类似的现象。根据东北地区的气候条件，一般都可以用国产柴油；在气候较冷的内蒙古地区，除了在冬季和初春的期间，也完全可以使用国产柴油。但是，这些地区的森林工业局却要求全年都用苏联的一号柴油；内蒙古森林工业管理局第三季度申请的进口柴油占全季的百分之九十以上。由于滥用超流向的优质煤和进口油料，今年木材成本估计要增加七十万元左右。
    取暖用煤也是一项很严重的浪费。森林工业部门每年的取暖用煤占用煤总数的百分之三十弱，有个别单位还用超流向的优质煤作取暖用煤。其实，大部分单位都可以用木柈（腐朽材和等外材劈的柈子）代替取暖用煤。如果能够这样做，今年就可以给国家节约四万多吨煤。
    此外，不少森林工业局的燃料消耗定额还有虚假现象。例如标定机车用煤的消耗定额只是根据行走一公里烧多少煤，而不是根据走一公里需要多少热量，耗用多少标准燃料，折合多少天然煤。因此，消耗定额一般偏高，浪费燃料。
    应该指出，有一些单位已经开始重视了节约燃料的工作，并且得到了一些成绩。例如，大石头和黄泥河森林工业局的职工们在去年注意改进操作技术和保管方法，坚持在不影响生产的条件下尽量用低质煤，结果少用了优质煤一万多吨，节约了人民币近九万元（还不包括超流向运输的特殊运价）。又如哈尔滨森林工业管理局发动职工讨论今年下半年计划，平均降低了燃料消耗定额百分之十左右。其中机车用煤降低了百分之九，减少四千五百多吨。希望森林工业部门中的其它单位也能大力开展节约燃料的工作。  林业部供销局  欧阳有谟
