    Shanghai Heavy Industry Factories Launch Competition to Fulfill Savings Targets
    Many state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private heavy industry factories in Shanghai are incorporating comprehensive savings targets into their work plans and successively launching labor competitions focused on fulfilling these targets.
    The Asia Steel Factory launched a comprehensive savings competition starting in August. Each workshop has incorporated the savings figures for this month into its work plan. The daily progress of workers' new savings achievements is published on the workshops' team economic accounting statements. A similar competition is also underway at the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory. This factory promotes workers' fulfillment of targets by publishing the results of increased production and savings once a day in each workshop and once every three days for the entire factory.
    At the Shanghai Agricultural Pharmaceutical Machinery Factory, in the discussion of savings targets and the organization of the competition, thirty-six production teams formulated savings targets and guarantee conditions for the second half of the year. Engineering and technical personnel and workers at the Shanghai Chemical Factory also proposed a number of significant savings measures. Among them, two measures already implemented in the rubber workshop—using reclaimed rubber instead of raw rubber for the inner layer of rubber tubes and using pine soot instead of expensive carbon black—can save 132,000 yuan in the second half of the year, and the quality of the rubber tubes is even better than before. This workshop also plans to save 10,000 yuan per month in the second half of the year by overcoming waste in production. They have delegated this target to each section and team, and many teams have formulated guarantee conditions and launched competitions.
    Many factories are also taking measures in terms of management systems, operations, and technology to reduce raw material consumption, increase metal utilization, and reduce defective and substandard products. (Xinhua News Agency)

    上海重工业工厂为完成节约指标开展竞赛
    上海许多国营、地方国营和公私合营重工业工厂正在把全面节约指标订入作业计划，陆续展开以完成节约指标为内容的劳动竞赛。
    亚细亚钢铁厂从八月份起展开了全面节约的竞赛。各车间将这个月应该节约的数字，都订入了作业计划。在车间的班组经济核算表上，每天公布工人们新的节约成果。同样的竞赛也在上海机床厂展开。这个厂以车间每天公布一次、全厂三天公布一次增产节约成果的办法，推动工人们完成指标。
    上海农业药械厂在讨论节约指标和组织竞赛中，有三十六个生产小组订出了下半年的节约指标和保证条件。上海化工厂的工程技术人员和工人也提出了好些重大的节约措施。其中已经在橡胶车间实行的用再生胶代替生胶做胶管内层和用松烟代替价格昂贵的炭黑两项措施，下半年就可以节约十三万二千元，而且胶管质量还比以前好。这个车间还打算从克服生产中的浪费方面在下半年按月节约一万元。他们已把这个指标下达到各个工段、小组，好些小组已订出保证条件展开了竞赛。
    许多工厂还在管理制度、操作和技术方面采取措施，来降低原材料的消耗量，提高金属利用率，减少废品和次品。　（新华社）
