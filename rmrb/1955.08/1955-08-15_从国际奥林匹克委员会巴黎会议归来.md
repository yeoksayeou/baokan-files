Returning from the International Olympic Committee Paris Meeting
Rong Gaotang, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Chinese Olympic Committee

The 50th session of the International Olympic Committee was held in Paris in June. Comrades Dong Shouyi, Zhang Lianhua and I represented the Chinese Olympic Committee at the meeting. This meeting was actually composed of three meetings. The first was a joint meeting of the International Olympic Committee and representatives of various international sports federations; the second was the joint meeting of the Executive Committee of the International Olympic Committee with representatives of national Olympic committees and representatives of various international sports federations; and the third was the International Olympic Committee meeting. The meeting had a total of thirty-seven agenda items and lasted five and a half days of discussion before it concluded. The meeting was attended by forty-four representatives from twenty-four international sports federations, seventy-five representatives from forty-seven national Olympic committees, and sixty-two members of the International Olympic Committee. Judging from the number of attendees and the scale of the meeting, this Paris meeting was a grand meeting of the International Olympic Committee.

The first issue encountered at the meeting was whether the 16th International Olympic Games would still be held in Melbourne, Australia. Due to the Australian government's ban on the import of competition firearms and the unsatisfactory progress of preparations for the 1956 Olympic Games in the past period, many countries raised doubts and questions. These opinions can be summarized as follows: (1) Issuing entry visas to athletes from all countries; (2) Allowing the import of firearms for competition; (3) Reducing the daily living expenses of athletes from $8.50 to $7.00. Finally, after the Australian member of the International Olympic Committee made a responsible guarantee, everyone expressed their trust.

One of the main agendas of this meeting was to discuss and decide on the locations for the 1960 Summer and Winter Olympic Games. After fierce debate and discussion, it was finally decided that the 17th International Olympic Games in 1960 would be held in Rome, Italy, and the Winter Olympic Games would be held in Squaw Valley, California, USA.

The meeting discussed the issue of amateurism in sports and how to protect the Olympic emblem. Although representatives from some countries verbally expressed their advocacy for amateurism and the protection of the Olympic emblem, they had to admit that they were not actually doing so. For example, in the United States, there are 300 stores that use the Olympic emblem as trademarks and advertisements. There is a very bad atmosphere in schools in the United States, where students can just play football all day without studying properly. This phenomenon is obviously a violation of amateurism.

This meeting resolved the issue that had been pending for four years, namely the recognition of the Olympic Committee of the German Democratic Republic. For four years, the International Olympic Committee's refusal to recognize the Olympic Committee of the German Democratic Republic was very wrong. They recognized the Olympic Committees of West Germany and Saar, but they unreasonably refused to recognize the Olympic Committee of the German Democratic Republic. At this meeting, due to the reasonable argument of the Olympic Committee of the German Democratic Republic and the support of many members, it was finally passed by a vote of twenty-seven to seven to temporarily recognize the Olympic Committee of the German Democratic Republic, that is, to require the German Democratic Republic and West Germany to organize a unified delegation to participate in the 1956 Olympic Games. If a unified delegation cannot be organized, the recognition will be revoked. This is naturally a step forward compared to the past, but it should be said that it is still not completely satisfactory. It is very regrettable that this meeting still did not include the widely developed volleyball and women's basketball in the Olympic Games.

A very meaningful resolution was passed at this meeting, that is, the International Olympic Committee awarded the Bonacossa Trophy to the Soviet Olympic Committee as part of the Olympic awards. This is a major event in world sports, marking the glorious achievements of the Soviet Union in developing mass sports activities for decades and promoting the spirit of the Olympic movement, and has become a shining example for the Olympic committees of various countries. Learning from the Soviet Union will surely enable China's sports to achieve good results.

It must be emphasized here that as a national sports organization in China, there is only one Chinese Olympic Committee, and the Olympic Committee of the People's Republic of China is the only sports organization that can legally represent the Chinese people and athletes to participate in the International Olympic Committee. The Chinese Olympic Committee was recognized very early, but after the founding of New China in 1949, the International Olympic Committee did not continue to recognize the Chinese Olympic Committee - the All-China Sports Federation. This issue was not resolved until the Athens meeting in 1954. However, at the same time as recognizing the All-China Sports Federation, they violated the spirit of the International Olympic Committee Charter and the will of the Chinese people and athletes, and recognized the so-called sports organization of the Chiang Kai-shek Group that embezzled the name of the "China National Amateur Athletic Federation." At this meeting, we put forward the just demand that "the recognition of the so-called 'China National Amateur Athletic Federation' that is impersonating the Chinese Olympic Committee should be revoked, and the Melbourne Olympic Organizing Committee should be notified to withdraw their invitation to them." However, the Chairman of the International Olympic Committee used the excuse of "sports do not talk about politics" to obstruct the realization of this just demand of the Chinese people and athletes. Now we want to ask who is engaged in politics? Is it not engaging in politics to artificially split the Chinese Olympic Committee into two? We firmly oppose doing so! Indeed, in international Olympic activities, some people are engaged in political discrimination under the guise of "sports are not related to politics" and "sports do not talk about politics." They not only engage in obvious political discrimination on the China issue, but also on the German issue. They delayed the recognition of the Olympic Committee of the German Democratic Republic for several years and tried every means to obstruct it, while the Olympic Committees of West Germany and Saar were recognized so easily. Isn't this the best proof of engaging in political discrimination?

### 从国际奥林匹克委员会巴黎会议归来

    从国际奥林匹克委员会巴黎会议归来
    中国奥林匹克委员会副主席兼秘书长  荣高棠
    国际奥林匹克委员会第五十届会议已于六月份在巴黎举行。我和董守义、张联华同志代表中国奥林匹克委员会参加了这次会议。这次会议实际上是包括三个会议。第一是国际奥林匹克委员会与各国际体育联合会代表的联席会议；第二是国际奥林匹克委员会执行委员会与各国奥林匹克委员会代表及各国际体育联合会代表的联席会议；第三是国际奥林匹克委员会会议。会议共有议程三十七项，进行了五天半的讨论才结束。出席这次会议的有二十四个国际体育联合会的四十四位代表，有四十七个国家奥林匹克委员会的七十五位代表及六十二位国际奥林匹克委员会的委员。从到会的人数及会议的规模来看，这次巴黎会议是国际奥林匹克委员会一次盛大的会议。
    会议首先碰到的问题，就是关于第十六届国际奥林匹克运动会是否仍然在澳大利亚墨尔本举行的问题。由于澳大利亚政府禁止比赛枪枝入口及一九五六年奥林匹克运动会在过去一个时期准备工作进行得不能令人满意，引起了许多国家的怀疑和质问。这些意见归纳起来是：（一）要求发给一切国家的运动员以入境签证；（二）要求允许比赛用的枪枝入口；（三）运动员每日生活费要从八点五美元降至七美元。最后在国际奥林匹克委员会澳大利亚委员做了负责的担保后，大家才表示了信任。
    这次会议的主要议程之一，就是讨论和决定一九六○年夏季和冬季奥林匹克运动会地点的问题。经过激烈的辩论和讨论，最后决定一九六○年第十七届国际奥林匹克运动会在意大利的罗马举行，冬季奥林匹克运动会在美国加利福尼亚州的斯阔谷举行。
    会议讨论了关于体育运动的业余主义和如何保护奥林匹克徽记的问题。虽然一些国家代表口口声声表示主张业余主义和保护奥林匹克徽记，但是他们也不得不承认他们实际上并非如此。如在美国就有三百家商店利用奥林匹克徽记作为商标和广告。在美国的学校里存在一种很坏的风气，就是学生们一天可以光踢足球不好好读书。这种现象显然是违反业余主义的。
    这次会议解决了四年来悬而未决的问题，即承认德意志民主共和国奥林匹克委员会的问题。四年以来，国际奥林匹克委员会拒绝承认德意志民主共和国奥林匹克委员会，是非常不对的。他们承认了西德和萨尔的奥林匹克委员会，可是他们却无理地拒绝承认德意志民主共和国奥林匹克委员会。这次会上由于德意志民主共和国奥林匹克委员会的据理力争和许多委员的支持，终于以二十七票对七票通过暂时承认德意志民主共和国奥林匹克委员会，那就是要德意志民主共和国和西德组织一个统一的代表队参加一九五六年奥林匹克运动会，如不能组织一个统一的代表队，就撤销承认。这自然比过去是前进了一步，但应当说，还是不能令人完全满意的。这次会议仍没有把在世界上开展的很广泛的排球运动和女子篮球列入奥林匹克运动会的项目，是令人非常遗憾的。
    在这次会议上通过一项很有意义的决议，就是国际奥林匹克委员会在颁发奥林匹克奖章中将波纳瓦萨奖奖给苏联奥林匹克委员会。这是世界体育活动中一个重大的事件，这标志着苏联数十年来开展群众性的体育运动，发挥奥林匹克运动的精神已获得辉煌的成就，已成为各个国家奥林匹克委员会的光辉榜样。我们向苏联学习，必然会使中国的体育运动得到良好的成就。
    在这里必须着重指出：作为中国全国性的体育组织，只有一个中国奥林匹克委员会，中华人民共和国的奥林匹克委员会是唯一能合法代表中国人民及运动员参加国际奥林匹克委员会的体育组织。中国奥林匹克委员会很早就被承认，但是在一九四九年新中国成立之后，国际奥林匹克委员会则不继续承认中国的奥林匹克委员会——中华全国体育总会。这个问题一直拖延到一九五四年雅典会议才解决。可是他们却又在承认中华全国体育总会的同时，竟违反国际奥林匹克委员会宪章的精神和中国人民及运动员的意志，承认盗用“中华全国体育协进会”名义的蒋介石集团的所谓体育组织。在这次会议上，我们提出了“应当撤销对冒充中国奥林匹克委员会的所谓‘中华全国体育协进会’的承认，并通知墨尔本奥林匹克组织委员会撤销对他们的邀请。”的正义要求，可是国际奥林匹克委员会主席却以“体育不谈政治”为借口阻挠中国人民及运动员的这个正义要求的实现。现在我们要问究竟是谁在搞政治呢？人为地把中国奥林匹克委员会分裂成两个，难道不正是在搞政治吗？我们坚决反对这样做！的确在国际奥林匹克活动中有人在“体育与政治无关”、“体育不谈政治”的幌子下搞政治歧视。他们不仅在中国问题上进行明显的政治歧视，在德国问题上也是如此。他们对于德意志民主共和国奥林匹克委员会的承认拖延了几年，并想尽一切办法阻挠，而对于西德和萨尔奥林匹克委员会是那样轻而易举的就予以承认，难道这不是搞政治歧视的最好证明吗？
