To the Editor:

　　Last year, the Wuhu Inland River Shipping Company of Anhui Province spent more than 11,000 yuan on labor and materials to repair the No. 224 tugboat in the third quarter. At that time, the workers raised objections to the design blueprint for the ship repair. However, the person in charge of this work refused to accept them, saying, "My design has been approved by higher authorities, and no one can change it." As a result, shortly after the tugboat was repaired and launched, it was discovered that the hull was too small and top-heavy. Therefore, it had to be returned for rework, and was repaired again in late March of this year, with an estimated cost of more than 1,600 yuan for labor and materials.

　　In addition, in order to spend the remaining funds from the end of 1954, the shipping department suspended a ship that had been sailing for just over two years for repairs. The ship's ribs and planks were still in good condition, and according to the ship repair workers and crew, "they could have been used for at least three or four more years." The preparation work for this repair was insufficient, and it was suspended shortly after the start due to a shortage of lumber. The repair blueprint was not drawn until more than a month after construction began, and many places accommodated the unreasonable phenomena caused by blind construction. For example, because the ship's displacement was small and it was not easy to rework, the method of increasing the thickness of the planks from three inches to eight inches was used to increase the ship's displacement. According to veteran workers, "We have never made such thick planks." Whether this ship will be able to sail in the future is still a question. Now the ship's repair costs have already used more than 30,000 yuan, exceeding the budget; but only half of the repair project has been completed. The loss of business income due to the suspension of navigation is also considerable.

　　The leaders of the Wuhu Inland River Shipping Company should quickly inspect these wasteful phenomena in the shipping department and deal with them seriously.

　　好轮船修成了坏轮船编辑同志：
　　国营安徽省芜湖内河轮船公司船务科在去年第三季度修理第二百二十四号拖轮，共用去工料费一万一千多元。当时，工人曾对修船的设计蓝图提出意见。但是负责这项工作的人拒不接受，却说：“我这个图样是经上级批准的，任何人也不能动。”结果，这只拖轮修理完毕后下水不久，发现船身狭小，头重脚轻。因此只得返工，在今年三月下旬又重新修理，估价须工料费一千六百多元。
　　另外，船务科为了用完一九五四年年终结余的资金，将一艘仅仅航行两年多的轮船停航修理。这只轮船的橑脚和水板都还是好的，据修船工人和船员反映“至少还可以用三四年”。这次修理工作事先准备不足，开工后不久就因为木料不够用而停工待料。修船的蓝图是在施工后一个多月才绘好的，不少地方都迁就了盲目施工所造成的不合理现象。例如，因为船的排水量小了，不好再返工，就用把水板从三英寸加厚为八英寸的办法来加大船的排水量。据老工人说：“我们从来没有做过这样厚的水板。”这只船将来是否能够航行，现在还是个问题。现在船的修理费已经用去人民币三万多元，超过了预算；但修理工程却只进行了一半。由于停航减少的营业收入，也是相当可观的。
　　芜湖内河轮船公司的领导人员应该迅速检查船务科的这些浪费现象，并且认真地进行处理。丁之伦
