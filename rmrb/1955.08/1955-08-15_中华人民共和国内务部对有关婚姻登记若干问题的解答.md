Answers from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the People's Republic of China on Several Questions Concerning Marriage Registration

    Question 1: The marriage registration regulations stipulate that the marriage registration authority in rural areas is the township or town People's Committee. Does this mean that all township and town People's Committees should handle marriage registration from the date of promulgation of the marriage registration regulations?

    Answer: To be cautious, it should be implemented gradually. Areas with sound township and town government organizations, capable cadres, and better implementation of the Marriage Law should conduct pilot programs first to gain experience for comprehensive implementation. Areas where conditions are not yet in place should actively prepare the conditions for townships to handle marriage registration, and should handle it immediately once conditions are met.

    Question 2: Why doesn't the township People's Committee handle divorce registration?

    Answer: Because the Marriage Law stipulates that the divorce registration authority is the district People's Government (the district office in counties, the district People's Committee in cities). At the same time, divorce issues are relatively complex, and handling them at the township level is prone to deviations. Therefore, it is not appropriate for townships to handle divorce registration.

    Question 3: If neither the man nor the woman is a resident within the jurisdiction of the marriage registration authority, can they be registered when applying for marriage registration?

    Answer: If neither the man nor the woman is a resident within the jurisdiction of the marriage registration authority, they will not be registered when they apply for marriage registration. Special circumstances must be referred to the superior leadership of the marriage registration authority for decision. As for cases where either or both parties have their home in the jurisdiction of the marriage registration authority but work outside the area, marriage can be handled upon returning home, but the parties should bring supporting documents.

    Question 4: What supporting documents are required for marriage?

    Answer: Supporting documents refer to certificates issued by the household registration authority, the department, military unit, school, organization, enterprise, or institution where the party is located, regarding the party's name, age, ethnicity, and marital status, etc. Or divorce certificates, divorce judgments, divorce agreements, etc.

    Question 5: Is a health check required before applying for marriage registration?

    Answer: Currently, pre-marital health checks are generally not implemented. However, parties who voluntarily undergo the check should be encouraged. When necessary, the marriage registration authority may require individual parties to go to a public hospital for examination and obtain a certificate from the public hospital, including whether there is syphilis, leprosy, mental disorder, and other serious diseases that should not be married. For those who apply for marriage registration with the above-mentioned diseases, the marriage registration authority will not register them.

    In some large and medium-sized cities, pre-marital health checks have already been implemented and have become a habit, they can continue to be implemented.

    Question 6: How should a marriage registration authority handle a case where one party applies for divorce from another party residing in another place?

    Answer: If one party requests a divorce from another party residing in another place, the plaintiff may file a complaint with the People's Court in the defendant's place of residence.

    Question 7: What should be done if the divorce agreement is not fulfilled?

    Answer: When a divorce is registered with the marriage registration authority, and there is a dispute due to non-fulfillment of the divorce agreement, the marriage registration authority should mediate, or the parties should apply to the People's Court for handling.

    Question 8: Marriage certificates, marriage application forms, divorce certificates, and divorce application forms printed by various localities before the promulgation of the marriage registration regulations are different from the format specified in the annex to the marriage registration regulations. Can they continue to be used?

    Answer: After the promulgation of the marriage registration regulations, new certificates should be used in accordance with the format stipulated in the marriage registration regulations in principle. However, in order to avoid waste, the original certificates can be used until they are used up.

    Question 9: Which level of People's Committee stipulates the cost of marriage certificates and divorce certificates?

    Answer: It is uniformly stipulated by the People's Committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government based on cost.

    中华人民共和国内务部对有关婚姻登记若干问题的解答
    问题一：婚姻登记办法规定：办理结婚登记的机关，在农村是乡、镇人民委员会。是否在婚姻登记办法公布之日起，所有的乡、镇人民委员会都应办理结婚登记？
    答：为慎重起见，应逐步推行。凡是乡、镇政权组织健全、干部能够胜任、婚姻法贯彻得较好的地区应先行试办，以便取得经验，全面推行。条件尚未具备的地区，应积极准备乡办理结婚登记条件，条件具备后即应办理。
    问题二：乡人民委员会为什么不办理离婚登记？
    答：因为婚姻法规定，办理离婚登记的机关是区人民政府（县是区公所，市是区人民委员会）。同时离婚问题比较复杂，由乡处理容易发生偏差，因此，乡办理离婚登记是不适宜的。
    问题三：男女双方都不是本婚姻登记机关所辖区内的居民，申请结婚登记的时候，是否可以办理？
    答：男女双方都不是本婚姻登记机关辖区内的居民，来申请登记结婚的，不予登记。特殊情况须请示婚姻登记机关的上级领导机关决定。至于男女双方或者一方家在本婚姻登记机关辖区内而本人在外地工作，回家结婚的可予办理，但当事人应携带证明文件。
    问题四：结婚时，须带的证明文件包括那些？
    答：证明文件是指户籍机关、当事人所在的机关、部队、学校、团体、企业、事业等部门，为当事人出具的有关姓名、年龄、民族、曾否结婚等情况的证明书。或者是离婚证、离婚判决书、离婚协议书等。
    问题五：在申请结婚登记前是否要进行健康检查？
    答：目前一般暂不实行婚前健康检查。但当事人自愿进行检查的应当鼓励。在必要的时候，婚姻登记机关可以要个别的当事人到公立医院去检查，并由公立医院出具证明，内容包括有无花柳病、麻疯病、精神失常以及其他不应结婚的严重病症等。对于患有上述疾病而申请结婚登记的人，婚姻登记机关不予登记。
    在某些大、中城市，已经实行婚前健康检查，并已成为习惯的时候，可以继续施行。
    问题六：一方向婚姻登记机关申请与在外地居住的另一方离婚，应如何处理？
    答：一方要求与在外地居住的另一方离婚，原告可以向被告居住地的人民法院提出申诉。
    问题七：不履行离婚协议，应如何处理？
    答：在婚姻登记机关登记离婚的，不履行离婚协议，双方发生争执的时候，婚姻登记机关应当加以调解，或者由当事人申请人民法院处理。
    问题八：婚姻登记办法颁布以前各地自行印制的结婚证、结婚申请书、离婚证、离婚申请书，和婚姻登记办法附件所规定的格式不一样，是否可以继续使用？
    答：婚姻登记办法公布后，原则上应依照婚姻登记办法所规定的格式使用新证件。但为了避免浪费，原有证件可以使用到用完为止。
    问题九：结婚证、离婚证的工本费由那一级人民委员会规定？
    答：由各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会按成本统一规定。
