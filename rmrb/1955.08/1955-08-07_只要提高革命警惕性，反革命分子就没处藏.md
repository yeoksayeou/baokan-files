    Resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate all counter-revolutionaries
    As long as we raise revolutionary vigilance, counter-revolutionaries will have nowhere to hide
    Sun Yongjiang, worker at the Fine Yarn Workshop of the State-owned Shanghai Tenth Cotton Textile Factory
    Back in January 1953, the fine yarn frames repaired by the maintenance section of the fine yarn workshop often malfunctioned. Belts would overheat, or spring teeth would jump. The maintenance section was constantly unable to complete its plans, which also affected the completion of the fine yarn workshop's production tasks. What was the reason for this? A doubt arose in my mind: could there be counter-revolutionaries sabotaging us? I mentioned it to the branch secretary, who said we should raise our vigilance and told me to pay more attention in the future and contact the security section if anything happened. I did as the branch secretary said.

    Once, six of us were repairing a machine. It was originally scheduled to be finished by 4:30 in the afternoon. By 4:30, five of us had finished our work, but only the master worker Chen A'si hadn't finished his. He didn't finish until 5:00. That day, after work, I was concerned about this machine. At 9:00 in the evening, I went to the workshop to check the running of the machines. When I entered the workshop, I saw that the fine yarn frame that had just been repaired had malfunctioned again. The problem was that the spring handle of the machine had not been tightened. This work was done by Chen A'si. At the time, I was very suspicious: Chen A'si's skills are better than mine, so why would there be an accident in such a simple operation?

    The next day, at the group meeting, we criticized Chen A'si. He nodded repeatedly and said, "It was my carelessness, I must examine myself." But after lunch, Wang Huaibao, who ate at the same table as Chen A'si, came to me and said that Chen A'si said while eating: "The self-criticism is just a self-criticism, after it is done it is over!" A few days later, the newly repaired No. 38 machine malfunctioned again. I asked labor model Ding Hailin to check it together, and found that Chen A'si had again tightened the screw cap too tightly during operation, which caused the malfunction.

    Chen A'si was a hooligan before the liberation of Shanghai, and also participated in the reactionary organization "Suppression of Rebellion and National Construction Committee." Many people suffered because of him. After liberation, he even incited workers behind their backs to refuse to promote the 1953 textile machine maintenance work method, and also wrote letters in the name of the group to falsely accuse worker Yu Fahua. However, Chen A'si pretended to be very honest in front of people, especially in front of party members. He even said to me: "Old Sun, you should help me more, I also want to strive to join the party." This made me even more suspicious. So this time, in addition to exposing and criticizing Chen A'si at the production inspection meeting, I also reported these situations to the security section. After that, I paid more attention to Chen A'si's actions.

    I remember one day we were repairing No. 12 machine. There was a branch meeting at 7:00 that morning. I did some work and went to attend the meeting. I was worried, because there were only Chen A'si and a few other people in the workshop. Would Chen A'si make trouble? I ran back to the workshop to take a look. Hey, there was no one in the workshop! I found the transformer room and Chen A'si and a few other people were like in a meeting. As soon as Chen A'si saw me, he pretended to be stupid and said, "How can I not find the five-cent screw!" While saying this, he slipped away. I immediately realized that Chen A'si was still trying to win people over!

    But after that, they were never seen gathering together for meetings in the factory again, but they were seen running to Zhao Chunshan's house. One day, I asked Youth League member Xu Weifu to visit Zhao's house. He saw that several of them were all at Zhao Chunshan's house. After that, accidents in the fine yarn workshop continued to happen, and the problems were not discovered immediately. Sometimes, several anonymous letters were received, all of which cursed the party members and Youth League members of the fine yarn workshop. I knew that it was Chen A'si and his gang who did it.

    One day in June last year, Wei Jinsheng, who was close to Chen A'si, ran to me angrily and said, "Old Sun, it's been a few years since liberation, and I'm still being oppressed!" "Who is oppressing you?" "Chen A'si! Just think, he borrowed my money, but he refuses to pay it back." After that, I paid more attention to getting close to Wei Jinsheng, playing with him, and chatting with him. Wei Jinsheng had lung disease before liberation and had no money to treat it. After liberation, he had labor insurance and his lung disease was cured. I used these things to enlighten his class consciousness; I also told him how counter-revolutionaries were sabotaging us, and enlightened him to raise his revolutionary vigilance. After a few months, Wei Jinsheng became familiar with me and told me a lot of materials about Chen A'si's activities. For example, Chen A'si said to them: "Party members and Youth League members often hold meetings to deal with us, we must also hold meetings to deal with them." Chen A'si told them to write anonymous letters, to not speak at meetings, or to attack party members and Youth League members together. Chen A'si also deliberately sowed discord between party members and workers, for example, saying to Wei Jinsheng: "We work so hard, but the party members are comfortable, lying at home and still getting paid." Chen A'si also said to Cui Fengxiang, who had been struggled against for corruption during the "Three-Anti" campaign: "How did they treat you during the Three-Anti campaign? If you don't counterattack now, when will you?"

    One day in August last year, I finished my machine repair work and went to help Chen A'si pull the oil line belt. Who knew that when I pulled it, the belt pulley shaft shook. I was wondering, but Chen A'si hurriedly grabbed it and tightened a screw on the belt pulley shaft, saying, "Careless, careless." That was not "careless," he was clearly not tightening the screws on the belt pulley shaft, so that when the machine was turned on, the belt pulley and the roller would rub against each other and catch fire, burning down the fine yarn workshop. I quickly reported this situation to the security section. At this time, the security section also had a lot of materials about Chen A'si's counter-revolutionary activities.

    In December last year, the people's government finally arrested this counter-revolutionary element according to law. Interrogation confirmed that Chen A'si was a hidden counter-revolutionary element. Before liberation, he had framed progressive workers, and after liberation, he had engaged in many counter-revolutionary activities. Now, Chen A'si has been sentenced to imprisonment by the people's court. (Recorded by Chen Juan)

### 只要提高革命警惕性，反革命分子就没处藏

    坚决、彻底、干净、全部地肃清一切反革命分子
    只要提高革命警惕性，反革命分子就没处藏
    国营上海第十棉纺织厂细纱车间工人　孙永江
    还是一九五三年的一月份，那时候，细纱车间保全部平过的细纱车常常发生毛病，一会儿皮带发热，一会儿弹簧牙齿跳了，保全部的计划老完不成，也影响到细纱车间生产任务的完成。这是什么缘故呢？我思想上起了个疙瘩，疑心着：会不会有反革命分子在破坏呢？对支部书记一说，支部书记就说应该提高警惕，还叮嘱我以后多留心点，有什么事情，同保卫科联系。我就照着支部书记的话去做。
    有一次，我们六个人平一台车，原规定下午四点半钟就要平好，到了四点半钟，我们五个人的工作都做完了，就只有老师傅陈阿四的工作没有做完，他直做到五点钟。这天下了班，我心里记挂着这台车。晚上九点钟，我就到车间去看开车的情况。走进车间一看，这台刚刚平好的细纱车又出了毛病，毛病就出在这个车的弹簧板手没有旋紧。这个工作就是陈阿四做的。当时我很怀疑：陈阿四技术比我高啊，为什么在这样普通的操作上还要出事故呢？
    第二天，在小组会上，我们批评了陈阿四，当时他连连点头说：“是我大意了，我要检讨。”可是吃过午饭以后，同陈阿四一桌吃饭的王淮宝跑来对我说，陈阿四在吃饭的时候说：“检讨管检讨，检讨过了拉倒！”过了几天，刚平好的三十八号车又出了毛病。我就请劳动模范丁海林一同去检查，发现又是陈阿四在操作时把螺丝帽旋得太紧，所以出了毛病。
    陈阿四这个人，在上海解放前是个流氓，还参加过“戡乱建国委员会”的反动组织，多少人吃过他的苦头。解放后，他还在背后煽动过工人拒绝推广一九五三年纺织机器保全工作法，还假冒小组的名义写信诬告过工人俞发华。可是，陈阿四在人面前装得很老实，特别在党员面前装得很积极，他还对我说：“老孙，你多帮助帮助我，我也要争取入党。”这更加引起了我的怀疑。所以这次，我除了在生产检查会议上揭发、批评了陈阿四以外，又把这些情况向保卫科作了汇报。以后，我就更注意陈阿四的行动。
    记得有一天我们平十二号车。这天上午七点钟要开支部大会，我做了一会工作就去参加会议。我不放心，因为车间里只有陈阿四和几个人，陈阿四会不会捣鬼？我就跑回车间去看一看。嘿，车间里一个人都没有！我找到变线间保全室，陈阿四和几个人像在开会呢。陈阿四一见我去，就假痴假呆地说：“五分螺丝怎么找不到了！”一边说一边溜走。我立刻警惕到，陈阿四还在拉拢人呢！
    可是以后，在厂里就再也看不到他们聚在一块开会了，但却看到他们有些人朝赵春山家里跑。有一天，我叫团员许伟富到赵家去探望，他看到他们几个人都在赵春山家里。以后细纱车间的事故还是不断地发生，而且出的毛病都不是一时能发现的。有个时候，还接到了几封无头信，信里都是骂细纱车间的党员、团员。我知道又是陈阿四这伙人干的事。
    去年六月里的一天，同陈阿四接近的韦金生气呼呼地跑来对我说：“老孙，解放几年了，我还受人的压迫呢！”“谁压迫你呢？”“陈阿四呀！你想，他借了我的钱，却死不肯还。”以后我就注意多去接近韦金生，同他一起玩，聊聊天。韦金生解放以前生了肺病没有钱医，解放以后有了劳动保险，就把他的肺病治好了。我就拿这些事情来启发他的阶级觉悟；还告诉他反革命分子怎样来破坏我们，启发他提高革命警惕性。过了几个月，韦金生同我熟了，就告诉我很多关于陈阿四活动的材料。例如，陈阿四对他们说：“党员、团员常开会来对付我们，我们也要开会来对付他们。”陈阿四叫他们写无头信（匿名信），叫他们开会不要发言，或者一齐攻击党员、团员。陈阿四还有意在党员和工人中间挑拨离间，例如对韦金生说：“我们做得吃力煞，党员倒写意，躺在家里照样拿工钱。”陈阿四还对在“三反”时因贪污被斗争过的崔凤祥说：“三反时候，他们对你怎么样？现在不反攻，等到什么时候？”
    去年八月有一天，我的平车活做完了，就去帮陈阿四拉油线带，谁知一拉，带盘轴就摇起来了。我正在奇怪，陈阿四却慌忙地抢过去把一根带盘轴的螺丝旋紧，嘴里说：“大意，大意。” 那里是“大意”，他分明是把带盘轴的螺丝不旋紧，一开车，好让带盘和滚筒发生磨擦发火，烧毁细纱车间。我赶紧把这件情况向保卫科作了汇报。这时保卫科也掌握了陈阿四很多反革命活动材料。
    去年十二月份，人民政府终于依法把这个反革命分子逮捕了。审讯证实陈阿四就是一个暗藏的反革命分子，解放前，他曾陷害过进步工人，解放后又干了许多反革命活动。现在，陈阿四已经被人民法院判了徒刑。　（陈涓记）
