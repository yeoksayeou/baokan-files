To do our utmost to store national grain well.
Deputy Director of the Grain Storage Bureau of the Ministry of Food, Mao Zichang

In recent years, the natural loss in national grain storage has gradually decreased. This is a great achievement in grain storage work. In 1954, under the promotion of the Ministry of Food, all parts of the country universally strengthened the cleaning and hygiene work of grain depots. According to the evaluation results of various regions, the country has 9,774 insect-free grain warehouses and 1,574 rooms, and 15,770 mold-free grain warehouses and 517 rooms. The vast number of employees in grain depots across the country have demonstrated their enthusiasm and created many advanced grain storage methods, tools, and instruments. At the same time, a large number of management and technical personnel have been trained and cultivated in grain storage work in various regions. These are all favorable conditions for further improving grain storage work.

However, it should be seen that there are still many shortcomings in our grain storage work. For example, due to poor management, the grain loss rate of many grain depots is still very high. Some grain depots still frequently experience grain mildew, deterioration, theft, and destruction, causing serious losses to the grain. In order to store grain better and more safely, all employees of the national grain depots must strive to reduce and eliminate losses in grain storage from all aspects.

Seizing the opportunity to eliminate pests in grain is one of the important links in reducing grain loss. According to the calculation of the amount of grain containing insects in national grain depots in April this year, 2,632,000 catties of grain were eaten by insects in one month. This means that if insect pests can be completely eliminated, the country can lose 2.63 million catties of grain less in one month. Some people believe that a lot of grain has been infested by insects in the fields, or infected with insect pests during harvesting, threshing, and transportation, so it is impossible to have no insects in the warehouse. This is a one-sided and negative idea. The task of the grain department is: to educate farmers to dry and clean the grain after harvesting and sell good grain, and also to take effective measures in the warehouse to kill pests and reduce grain loss. It must be recognized that it is possible to have insect-free grain warehouses, and the key lies in whether the grain depot staff can make arduous efforts. This has been proven by the experience of creating insect-free grain warehouses in various regions. Of course, in the process of creating insect-free grain warehouses, attention should be paid to saving grain depot expenses. Some places spare no expense in order to create insect-free grain warehouses, which is not in line with the spirit of comprehensive savings and should be corrected.

Rats and sparrows stealing grain are important causes of grain loss. However, there are still many units whose staff ignore bird and rat prevention work. Some people say: "Rats are underground, and sparrows are in the sky. People cannot enter the ground or climb into the sky. It is impossible to eliminate rats and sparrows in grain depots." The experience of the Badao Hao Grain Depot in Liaoning Province is a good answer to this statement. When Comrade Li Fusheng of this grain depot started to lure and kill rats and scare away sparrows, the effect was not great. Later, he used smelly oil to trap rats. As soon as the rats came out of their holes, they were caught. According to the habits of sparrows flying towards bright places, he first opened the doors and windows of the warehouse to let the sparrows fly in, and then closed the doors and windows tightly, leaving a light-transmitting place, and set up a sparrow cage to drive all the sparrows into the cage to catch them. After that, the sparrows dared not enter the warehouse. After his continuous efforts, this grain depot became a rat-free and sparrow-free grain depot. According to statistics from January to May this year, grain depots in 14 provinces and cities, including Shandong, Henan, and Jilin, captured a total of 470,000 rats, which can reduce the country's losses by about 14 million catties of grain a year.

Preventing grain from mildewing and deteriorating is a major event that grain depot staff must always pay attention to. Some grain storage staff believe that: in recent years, due to the implementation of unified grain purchase measures, the masses deliver grain early, and there is no time to dry it after it is put into the warehouse. The ventilation and moisture-proof conditions in the warehouse are not good, and there is no drying equipment, so it is impossible to achieve mold-free grain. This idea is wrong. It is precisely because of this situation that grain storage staff should strengthen their sense of responsibility and strengthen their subjective efforts. All grain storage staff should learn such skills: not only can they store high-quality grain, but also store low-quality grain; not only can they store grain well under the conditions of good warehouses, but also store grain well in the conditions of second-rate warehouses and open-air warehouses without mildew or spoilage. Since this spring, most of the 65,360,000 catties of grain that have been moldy and spoiled in various regions belong to people's warehouses and second-rate warehouses. If we can strictly inspect the grain for pests, moisture, temperature, impurities, etc., and find problems and deal with them in time, then these grain losses can be prevented.

Fire prevention, theft prevention, and prevention of sabotage by counter-revolutionaries are important issues that must not be relaxed or neglected in grain storage work. In the first quarter of this year, the grain lost due to fire incidents increased by 2.3 times compared with the same period last year; the losses suffered due to theft incidents increased a lot compared with the same period last year. We must be a hundred times more vigilant, do a good job in grain security, and resolutely fight against the theft and destruction of state grain by bandits and counter-revolutionaries. The key to doing a good job in fire prevention and theft prevention lies in relying on the broad masses of the people and strengthening mass work. As long as we regularly conduct fire prevention and theft prevention publicity and education work to the local masses, and closely connect the relationship between grain staff and the masses, the masses will often take the initiative to help the grain depot protect the state's grain.

In order to reduce grain losses, grain depots in various regions must also reduce soil grain (that is, grain mixed with a large amount of soil) as much as possible or clean up soil grain in time. At present, a large number of soil grain have been accumulated in many areas. According to statistics from 15 counties and cities in Liaoning and Jilin alone, there were 470,000 catties of soil grain that had not been cleaned up by the end of June this year. Some areas do not clean up soil grain at all, so that grain grows seedlings in garbage dumps. Some staff members believe that cleaning up soil grain is "not worth the effort," or use being too busy as an excuse to delay the work of sorting soil grain. Both of these understandings and behaviors are wrong. The people of the whole country are accumulating funds for the country bit by bit in various positions. What reason do grain storage staff have not to pay attention to reducing soil grain and cleaning up soil grain in time to reduce grain losses for the country?

Grain is the most precious material of the country. All employees of the grain storage department must store the country's grain well with a high degree of patriotism, conscientiousness, and diligence. Minimizing grain losses in the storage process is the best contribution of all employees of the grain storage department to national construction.

    尽一切力量把国家粮食保管好
    粮食部仓储局副局长　毛子长
    几年来，全国粮食保管中的自然损耗已逐步降低，这是粮食保管工作中已取得的一个很大的成绩。一九五四年，在粮食部的推动下，全国各地普遍加强了粮库的清洁卫生工作。根据各地评定的结果，全国已有无虫粮仓九千七百七十四座又一千五百七十四间，无霉粮仓一万五千七百七十座又五百一十七间。各地粮库的广大职工发挥了积极性，创造了许多先进的粮食保管方法和工具、仪器。同时，各地在粮食保管工作中还训练和培养了大批管理人员和技术人员。这些都是进一步改善粮食保管工作的有利条件。
    但是，应该看到，我们的粮食保管工作中还有不少缺点。例如，由于管理不善，许多粮库的粮食损耗率还是很高的。有些粮库还时常发生粮食霉烂、变质、被盗、被毁等事件，使粮食受到了严重的损失。为了把粮食保管得更好，更安全，国家粮库的全体职工必须努力从各方面减少和杜绝粮食保管中的损失。
    抓紧时机消灭粮食中的害虫，是减少粮食损耗的重要环节之一。根据今年四月全国粮库含有虫子的粮食数量计算，一个月就有二百六十三万二千斤粮食被虫子吃掉。这就是说，如能彻底消灭虫害，一个月就能使国家少损失二百六十三万斤粮食。有些人认为：好些粮食在田间即遭了虫害，或者在收割、打场、运输过程中感染了虫害，因此要想做到仓库里没有虫子，是不可能的。这是一种片面的和消极的思想。粮食部门的任务就是：既要教育农民在收粮后把粮食晒干扬净，交售好粮，同时也要在仓库里采取有效措施杀除害虫，减少粮食的损耗。必须认识，要做到粮仓无虫是可能的，关键在于粮库工作人员能否作艰苦的努力。这已是各地创造无虫粮仓的经验所证明了的。当然，在创造无虫粮仓过程中，应该注意节约粮库开支，有的地方为了创造无虫粮仓，不惜大量开支，这是不符合全面节约的精神的，应该加以纠正。
    鼠、雀盗食粮食，是粮食损耗的重要原因之
  一。但是现在还有不少单位的工作人员忽视防雀捕鼠工作。有人说：“鼠在地下，雀在天空，人不能入地登空，粮库里的鼠、雀是不可能消灭的。”对于这种说法，辽宁省八道壕粮库的经验，就是一个很好的回答。这个粮库李福生同志开始诱杀老鼠、吓唬麻雀时，收效不大；后来他利用臭油黏力捕鼠，只要老鼠一出洞，就被捉住。他根据雀往亮处飞的习性，先开仓库的门窗让雀飞进，然后把门窗密闭，留一透光处，设下捕雀笼，就把雀全部驱进笼子里捉住，以后麻雀就不敢进仓库了。经过他不断的努力，这个粮库就变成了无鼠、无雀粮库。据今年一至五月的统计，山东、河南、吉林等十四个省、市粮库共捕老鼠四十七万只，大约一年可为国家减少损失一千四百万斤粮食。
    预防粮食霉烂变质，是粮库工作人员时刻都要注意的一件大事。有些粮食保管工作人员认为：近年来由于实行粮食统购措施，群众交粮早，入库后没有时间晒干，仓库里通风、隔潮条件又不好，干燥设备也没有，因此就不可能做到粮食无霉。这种思想是不对的。正是由于这种情况，粮食保管工作人员才更应该加强自己的责任心，加强自己的主观努力。粮食保管工作人员都应该学会这样的本领：不仅会保管上等粮食，而且会保管好次等粮食；不仅能在好仓库的条件下保管好粮食，而且能在次等仓和露天仓的条件下把粮食保管得不霉不坏。今年春季以来，各地霉坏的六千五百三十六万斤粮食，大部是属于民仓、次仓里的。如果能严格检验粮食的虫害、水份、温度、杂质等情况，发现问题，及时处理，那末，这些粮食损失是可以防止的。
    防火、防盗、防止反革命分子破坏，是粮食保管工作中必须时刻不容松懈和疏忽的一个重要问题。今年第一季度因发生失火事件损失的粮食较去年同期增加了二点三倍；因发生盗窃事件所受的损失较去年同期增加很多。我们必须百倍地提高警惕，做好粮食保卫工作，同盗匪和反革命分子盗窃和毁坏国家粮食的行为进行坚决的斗争。做好防火、防盗工作的关键在于依靠广大群众，在于加强群众工作。只要经常向当地群众进行防火、防盗的宣传教育工作，密切粮食工作人员同群众的关系，群众就会经常主动来帮助粮库保护国家的粮食。
    为了减少粮食的损失，各地粮库还必须尽可能地减少土粮（即混杂了大量泥土的粮食）或及时清理土粮。目前有不少地区积存了大批土粮，仅据辽宁、吉林等十五个县、市的统计，到今年六月底就有四十七万斤土粮没有清理出来。有的地区对于土粮根本不收拾，以致粮食在垃圾堆里长出了苗。有些工作人员认为收拾土粮“不够工夫钱”，或者以忙不过来为借口，把整理土粮的工作一拖再拖下去。这种认识和行为都是错误的。全国人民都在各个不同的岗位上一点一滴地为国家积累资金，粮食保管工作人员有什么理由不重视减少土粮和及时清理土粮的工作，为国家减少粮食损失呢？
    粮食是国家的最珍贵的物资，粮食保管部门的全体职工都必须以高度的爱国主义热情，兢兢业业、勤勤恳恳地把国家的粮食保管好。在保管过程中最大限度地减少粮食的损失，就是粮食保管部门全体职工给国家建设的最好的贡献。
