　　Give Full Play to the Role of Films on Rural Mutual Aid and Cooperation
　　Xu Ruzhong
    Using the weapon of film to conduct socialist education among the broad masses of peasants and encourage them to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation is the glorious political task of rural film projection teams. The films about the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement screened by rural projection teams in various regions have played a significant role in promoting the local mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    However, some rural projection teams in some areas do not pay enough attention to this, and even are unwilling to screen this type of film, fearing that the masses will get tired of watching this type of film and will not want to watch it again, which will affect income and prevent them from completing their economic tasks. They arrange films such as "Spark Collective Farm" and "People Strive to Go Higher" as accompanying films, and only show them when "absolutely necessary." This thinking and practice are wrong.

    It is true that the content of our existing films reflecting agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation is not diverse enough. They do not publicize the importance of agricultural production and mutual aid and cooperation from all aspects through vivid descriptions of various characters and events, often giving the audience a sense of "generalization." This is something that the film work leadership departments should pay attention to. But as far as film projection teams are concerned, how to actively give play to the role of existing films of this kind is also a very important issue.

    When the Anyang County Film Projection Team in Henan Province screened the film "Spark Collective Farm" in Jijiatun, they first conducted an in-depth understanding of the ideological situation of the local masses and found that some farmers had ideological concerns such as fearing losses after joining the cooperative. Therefore, they seized the shots of villagers working collectively, distributing grain, and the happy family life of villagers in the film to explain to the audience the superiority of collective labor, and to promote the principle of distribution according to work, more work more gain, everyone getting rich, and rising together, dispelling the masses' concerns about joining the cooperative, and arousing great interest among the masses. The masses requested the projection team to show it again the next day, to take a closer look at other people's good lives.

    Here is another example. After the masses in a certain township learned that the projection team was coming to screen the film "Spark Collective Farm," they rushed to welcome the projection team and enthusiastically asked the projectionist about the content of the film. However, the projectionist coldly replied, "'Spark Collective Farm' is a documentary film about production matters. There are no actors, nothing to see." This poured cold water on the masses, greatly disappointing them. The reason why this projectionist took such a wrong attitude was: "I don't get excited when I see agricultural production films."

    From the above two facts, it can be clearly seen that the problem is not whether the masses like agricultural production films or not, but whether the projectionist likes them or not, and whether the projectionist attaches importance to the screening of this type of film. Many experiences have proved that the extent to which a film plays a role among the masses is directly related to how well the film's publicity work is done. The projection teams should fully recognize the importance of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, and should closely cooperate with this movement to publicize the content of these films, correct various erroneous views and practices, and enable these films to play a greater role among the peasant masses.

### 充分发挥有关农村互助合作的影片的作用

　　充分发挥有关农村互助合作的影片的作用
　　徐如中
    运用电影这个武器，向广大农民群众进行社会主义的教育，鼓励他们走互助合作的道路，这是农村电影放映队的光荣的政治任务。各地农村放映队所放映的关于农业生产互助合作运动的影片，对当地的互助合作运动起了不少的推动作用。
    可是有些地区的农村放映队却对此重视不够，甚至不愿放映这一类影片，唯恐群众看这类影片看腻了，不愿再看，以致影响收入，不能完成经济任务。他们把“星火集体农庄”、“人往高处走”等影片排作配片，只在“万不得已”的情况下，才拿出来放映。这种想法和作法是不对的。
    不错，我们现有的反映农业生产互助合作的影片的内容还不够多样，没有从各个方面，通过各种人物和事件的生动描写来宣传农业生产和互助合作的重要性，往往给观众以“一般化”的感觉，这是电影工作领导部门应该注意的。但就电影放映队来说，如何积极发挥现有的这类影片的作用，也是一个非常重要的问题。
    河南省安阳县电影放映队在姬家屯放映“星火集体农庄”影片时，首先深入地了解了当地群众的思想情况，发现有些农民有怕入社后吃亏等思想顾虑，于是抓住影片中庄员集体劳动、分粮食和庄员愉快的家庭生活等镜头，向观众解释了集体劳动的优越性，宣传了按劳分配，多劳多得，大家富裕，一齐上升的道理，打消了群众对入社的顾虑，引起群众极大的兴趣。群众要求放映队在第二天再放映一遍，要仔细看看人家的好生活。
    还有另一方面的例子。某乡群众知道放映队前来放映“星火集体农庄”影片的消息后，纷纷跑来欢迎放映队，热情地向放映员打听影片的内容。放映员却冷冰冰地回答道：“‘星火集体农庄’是纪录片，讲的是生产事，没有演员，没看头。”这就给群众泼了冷水，使群众大为扫兴。这位放映员所以要采取这样错误态度的理由是：
  “我看到农业生产影片就不带劲”。
    从以上两件事实，很清楚地可以看出问题不在于群众喜欢不喜欢农业生产影片，而在于放映员喜欢不喜欢，在于放映员重视不重视这类影片的放映工作。不少经验证明，一部影片在群众中所起的作用的大小，同影片的宣传工作做得好坏有直接的关系。放映队应该充分认识农业互助合作运动的重要性，应该紧密地配合这一运动来宣传这类影片的内容，纠正各种错误的看法和做法，使这类影片在农民群众中发挥更大的作用。
