Why Is This Swindler Able to Get Away With Things?
Editor:

	In the latter half of 1954, just as a new semester was about to begin, a man named Bing Yan came to see Wang Jindong, the vice dean of Nankai University in Tianjin. This person presented a letter of introduction from Professor Yin Da of Peking University, which stated: Bing Yan is Yin Da's nephew; his father was a regimental commander in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and had died in Korea. Bing Yan wanted to transfer from the Harbin Foreign Languages ​​Specialized School to Nankai University to study, requesting assistance and care. With such a letter of introduction, Bing Yan entered Nankai University and enjoyed the benefits of a "Grade A" People's Scholarship.

	At the beginning of this year, Bing Yan was suddenly arrested by the Tianjin Public Security Bureau. The letter of introduction he presented when he came to Nankai University was forged; he did not know Professor Yin Da at all.

	Looking back at Bing Yan's history, it turns out he is a bad element who has consistently engaged in deception and swindling. His original name was Bing Yan, and he is twenty-four years old this year. He once infiltrated the Chinese Communist Party. In 1951, he was studying at the Harbin Foreign Languages ​​Specialized School and engaged in theft; later, he argued with the head of the school's personnel department and voluntarily requested to withdraw from school. In 1952, the Organization Department of the former Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee introduced him to the Higher Education Department in Beijing to handle transfer procedures, actually handing over all his files to him personally. He discovered that the organization's assessment of him was very unfavorable, so he ran back to the Organization Department of the Northeast Bureau, falsely claiming that all the file materials had been lost. The Organization Department of the Northeast Bureau did not investigate this matter and issued him a certificate of lost files and a letter of introduction for Party members. Therefore, he burned his own file materials.

	After Bing Yan came to Beijing, he was assigned to study at the Beijing Russian Language Institute by the Higher Education Department. He was dishonest on almost every issue. Some classmates said, "If Bing Yan tells ten sentences, it's good if three of them are true." Later, after investigation by the school's Party organization, he was forced to confess to privately burning file materials and was therefore expelled from the Party. As for Bing Yan's historical situation, even when, where, and by whom he was introduced to the Party, the personnel department of the Beijing Russian Language Institute could not figure it out.

	Later, Bing Yan intentionally committed murder over a love affair and was sentenced to imprisonment by the People's Court. After he was released, he forged Professor Yin Da's letter of introduction and infiltrated Nankai University again.

	Bing Yan's deceptive behavior shows that some of our comrades are too careless, and it also shows that many of our units have not strictly adhered to the Party and state systems (such as the procedures for transferring Party membership and the school's admission system). These are lessons we should learn from.

### 为什么这个骗子能够混来混去

    为什么这个骗子能够混来混去编辑同志：
    一九五四年下半年，正是新的一个学期将要开始的时候，一个名叫丙岩的人来找天津南开大学副教务长王金鼎。这个人拿了一封北京大学尹达教授的介绍信，信上说：丙岩是尹达的外甥；他的父亲是中国人民志愿军的团长，已在朝鲜牺牲。丙岩要从哈尔滨外国语专科学校转入南开大学学习，请求协助照顾。凭着这样一封介绍信，丙岩就进了南开大学，并且享受了“甲种”人民助学金的待遇。
    今年年初，丙岩突然被天津市公安局逮捕了。他来南开大学时拿的介绍信是假造的，他根本就不认识尹达教授。
    翻开丙岩的历史看看，原来他是一个一贯招摇撞骗的坏分子。他原名邴岩，今年二十四岁。他曾经混入了中国共产党。一九五一年他在哈尔滨外国语专科学校学习，有偷窃行为；后来又因为同学校人事科长吵架而自动要求退学。一九五二年原中共中央东北局组织部介绍他来北京高等教育部办理转学手续，竟把他的全部档案材料交给他本人。他发现组织对他的鉴定很不好，就跑回东北局组织部，假说是档案材料全部遗失。东北局组织部对这件事情不加查究，就给他开了遗失档案的证明和党员的介绍信。于是，他就烧毁了自己的档案材料。
    丙岩来北京以后，被高等教育部分配到北京俄语学院学习。他几乎在一切问题上都不老实，有的同学说：“丙岩说十句话，有三句真话就算好的。”后来经过学校党组织的追查，他被迫交代了私自烧毁档案材料的事情，因此受到开除党籍的处分。至于丙岩的历史情况甚至他是在何时、何地，由何人介绍入党的，北京俄语学院的人事部门也闹不清楚。
    后来，丙岩因为恋爱问题而蓄意杀人，被人民法院判处了徒刑。在他被释放后，又伪造了尹达教授的介绍信混进了南开大学。
    丙岩的欺骗行为说明了我们有些同志太麻痹了，也说明了我们有许多单位没有严格地遵守党和国家的制度（如党员转关系的手续和学校的入学制度）。这些，都是我们应该接受的教训。
