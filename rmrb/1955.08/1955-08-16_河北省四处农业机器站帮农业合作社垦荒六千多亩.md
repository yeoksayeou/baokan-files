    Four agricultural machine stations in Hebei Province Help Agricultural Cooperatives Reclaim More Than 6,000 Mu of Land
    This spring, the four agricultural machine stations in Putou, Tongxian County, and Gecun, Shahe County, Hebei Province, allocated some tractors to help agricultural production cooperatives and county farms in the vicinity that had more land, lacked labor and animal power, and had suffered from disasters for years to reclaim 6,200 mu of raw and ripe wasteland. Some of the land was also harrowed and covered to preserve moisture. The Putou Agricultural Machine Station in Tongxian County helped Daxing County reclaim more than 2,700 mu of wasteland, exceeding the original reclamation plan by more than one and a half times. This freed up more than 27,000 laborers to be invested in farmland water conservancy construction and spring sowing. The Gecun Agricultural Machine Station in Shahe County helped the agricultural production cooperatives in Liucun and Beiyangcun reclaim more than 1,400 mu of land that had been barren for eighteen years, and all of it was sown with sorghum. Currently, the sorghum seedlings are growing well. According to the masses, each mu can produce at least 100 jin. It is estimated that the country can increase grain production by 150,000 jin.

    河北省四处农业机器站帮农业合作社垦荒六千多亩
    河北省通县铺头、沙河县葛村等四处农业机器站，今春抽出部分拖拉机帮助附近土地多、劳力畜力缺乏、而又连年遭灾的农业生产合作社和县农场开垦生熟荒六千二百多亩。其中有部分土地还进行了耙、盖等保墒工作。通县铺头农业机器站帮助大兴县开垦荒地二千七百多亩，超过原开荒计划一倍半以上。节省出二万七千多个劳动力，投入兴修农田水利和春播工作。沙河县葛村农业机器站帮助留村和北杨村的农业生产合作社开垦了荒芜十八年的土地一千四百多亩，并全部播种了高粱。目前高粱苗都生长良好，据群众反映；每亩至少可产一百斤。预计可为国家增产粮食十五万斤。　（苗悦）
