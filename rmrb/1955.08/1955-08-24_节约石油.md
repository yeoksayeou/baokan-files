　　Conserving Petroleum
　　Jin Wu
    Petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, kerosene, and lubricating oil used in various machines are essential materials for national economic construction and play an extremely important role in industry, agriculture, national defense, and transportation. However, many factories, mines, and transportation units do not pay attention to conserving oil, and the phenomenon of wasting petroleum is very serious.
    Many factories and mining enterprises regard the amount of oil used as a "trivial matter." When calculating oil consumption, they always adopt the attitude of "being generous in budgeting and frugal in use, just in case." For example, the Beijing Railway Administration's Material Supply Department actually only needs 13.2 tons of diesel, but they requested 30 tons. In many factory workshops, the erroneous idea that "more oil is not a bad thing; the more, the better" and "if you add half a kilogram of oil, it will run on its own" is prevalent. They believe that as long as the machine can operate, using a little more oil doesn't matter. As a result, oil is spilled all over the place in these workshops. In the transportation sector, the phenomenon of vehicles running empty is very serious. According to incomplete statistics from the First Construction Company and the Seventh Construction Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering from January to April this year, the return trip rate is 40 to 60 percent. Public bus schedules are not well coordinated with the working hours of government offices, schools, and factories, causing congestion during rush hours and empty runs at other times. Some transportation departments do not maintain vehicles according to regulations, which also increases gasoline consumption. For example, the ZIS-5 buses of the Zhengzhou Public Transportation Company, due to the lack of timely adjustment of parts, consumed 19.95 percent more fuel than the quota. Some government offices, organizations, and schools always think that "if there's a car, it should be used, and spending a little oil doesn't matter." Some units have a large passenger car with only three to five people; some large trucks carry only 100 to 200 kilograms of goods or even just a few dozen brooms or a few baskets of vegetables, driving all over the city.
    Some distribution and supply departments do not thoroughly study and understand the actual oil consumption of various types of machines or vehicles, nor do they carefully review oil consumption plans. After distribution or supply, they do not regularly understand the usage situation, nor do they assist various departments in mobilizing the masses to pay attention to conservation and study conservation methods. Instead, they allow the oil-using units to take as much as they want, and give them whatever type they want, thereby encouraging waste in the oil-using units.
    The state-owned petroleum company's poor management and transportation of oil products has also caused great waste. Last year, the petroleum company had more than 5,000 accidents in storage and transportation, and excess losses accounted for 44 percent of the petroleum company's total property losses.
    Overcoming waste and conserving petroleum is of great significance to the development of industry, agriculture, and transportation. If we save 15 tons of diesel or gasoline, we can supply one more tractor's annual oil consumption and cultivate more than 20,000 mu of land; or we can supply one more 12-horsepower diesel engine for annual power generation, or two more drilling rigs for annual drilling; or we can supply two more trucks for annual transportation, transporting about 500,000 ton-kilometers of materials.
    In order to provide more power resources for national economic construction, all departments must strive to eliminate all phenomena of wasting petroleum. All leading staff members of oil-using departments such as factories, mines, and transportation must recognize the serious significance of conserving oil, and educate workers and relevant management personnel to overcome waste in all aspects. We must include saving oil as a concrete part of labor competition, mobilize the masses to study conservation methods, and reduce oil consumption rates. We must resolutely oppose the erroneous idea that wasting a little oil is a "small matter."
    In order to conserve petroleum, it is necessary to technically improve the methods and tools for using various oil products and improve oil utilization efficiency. For example, placing containers under machines to collect oil, paying attention to avoiding spillage when refueling, adapting the size of the oil can spout to the oil hole, and paying attention to the timing and quantity of refueling can all reduce waste. In transportation, rationally organizing transportation, striving for full loads and two-way trips, and gradually reducing the return trip rate; promoting and continuing to research and improve automobile anti-knock devices; and strictly implementing the automobile maintenance system can all greatly reduce oil consumption quotas.
    In order to conserve petroleum, factories and mines must strengthen the utilization of waste oil, and supply departments must strengthen the recycling of waste oil. Under normal circumstances, it is entirely possible to recover 20 to 30 percent of waste oil. This waste oil can still be used after reprocessing.
    Strict conservation should be implemented for general non-productive oil use. Government agencies and organizations should have reasonable management systems, unified use, control unnecessary driving, and oppose waste. Traffic vehicles and large trucks of government agencies and organizations should also gradually and systematically implement unified management and unified use according to the specific conditions of the region to reduce empty loads. Strict criticism should be given to those who waste vehicles for personal enjoyment.
    National distribution and supply departments should regularly understand the usage of various oil products by oil-using units; focus on coordinating with workers and engineering and technical personnel in factories and mines to analyze the oil consumption quotas of various types of machines and study conservation methods; carefully review the oil consumption plans of various units on the basis of investigation and research, and supply reasonably. Wasting petroleum must be exposed in a timely manner and assist and supervise relevant units to correct it. We must change the idea of only being responsible for supply and not seriously reviewing or thinking that "the supply department can't control it." The state-owned petroleum company must do a good job in the storage and transportation of oil products and make the greatest effort to continuously reduce losses. Oil tankers should be unloaded as cleanly as possible.
    The potential for saving oil is great. The wisdom of the broad masses is an infinite potential. For example, after the Zhengzhou No. 1 State-owned Cotton Mill implemented the conservation measures of adding oil frequently and in small amounts and changing to the oil blank refueling method, the monthly oil consumption decreased from about 190 kilograms to about 100 kilograms, a reduction of 41 percent. Strengthening management and controlling usage can also tap huge potential. For example, the State Planning Commission adopted the management methods of unified use of automobiles and appropriate control, and on the basis of already reducing gasoline by 32 percent, it further reduced the usage by 62 percent.
    In order to expand the effect of saving oil, industrial, transportation and other competent departments and national supply departments should pay attention to introducing and promoting advanced experiences in a timely manner, and give necessary rewards to units that have made significant achievements in conservation. Serious wasteful behavior must be exposed and fought against.

　　节约石油
　　靳吾
    汽油、柴油、煤油和各种机器上使用的润滑油等石油产品，是国家经济建设中不可缺少的重要物资，对于工业、农业、国防和交通运输业都有极其重要的作用。但是，现在有不少厂矿企业和交通运输单位，却不重视节约用油，浪费石油的现象很严重。
    不少厂矿企业把用油多少当成“无足轻重的小事情”。他们计算用油量时，总是抱着“宽打窄用，有备无患”的态度。例如北京铁路管理局材料供应处实际上只需要十三点二吨柴油，但他们却提出要用三十吨。在许多工厂的车间里，流传“油多不坏事，越多越好”，“油捁一斤半，不开自己转”的错误说法，认为只要机器能开动，多用点油不算什么。结果在这些车间里，抛洒得遍地都是油。在交通运输部门，车辆往返跑空的现象很严重。据建筑工程部第一建筑公司和北京市第七建筑公司今年一至四月的不完全统计，回空率占百分之四十至六十。公共汽车的班次不能同机关、学校、工厂的上下班时间很好配合，使上下班时拥挤，平时则空跑。有些运输部门不按规定保养车辆，也增加了汽油的消耗。如郑州市公共汽车公司吉斯五型客车，由于没有及时调整机件，耗油量竟超过定额百分之一九点九五。有些机关、团体、学校，总以为“有车就应该使用，花点油无所谓”。有的单位一辆大客车只坐三、五个人；有的大卡车只装载一、二百斤东西甚至几十把扫帚或是几筐蔬菜，满城行驶。
    有些分配部门和供应部门不很好地研究、了解各型机器或车辆的实际耗油情况，不认真地审查用油计划；分配或供应以后，也不经常了解使用情况，不协助各部门发动群众注意节约和研究节约办法；而是听凭用油单位要多少给多少，要什么品种给什么品种，从而助长了用油单位的浪费。
    国营石油公司对油品的保管、运输工作做得不好，也造成很大浪费。去年石油公司在保管、运输工作中发生了五千多次事故，超额损耗占到石油公司全部财产损失的百分之四十四。
    克服浪费、节约石油，对工业、农业和交通运输业的发展有重要的意义。如果我们节约十五吨柴油或汽油，就可以多供一部拖拉机的全年用油，可多耕种二万多亩地；或者可以多供一部十二马力的柴油机全年发电使用，或者多供给两部钻探机全年钻探使用；或者多供两部卡车的全年运输使用，约多运输五十万吨公里的物资。
    为了给国家经济建设提供更多的动力资源，各部门必须努力消除一切浪费石油的现象。所有厂矿企业、交通运输等用油部门的领导工作人员，必须认识节约用油的严重意义，教育工人和有关的管理人员从各方面克服浪费。要把节约用油列为劳动竞赛的具体内容之一，发动群众研究节约办法，降低耗油率。坚决反对认为浪费点油是“小事”的错误思想。
    为了节约石油，需要从技术上改进各种油品的使用方法和工具，提高用油效率。例如，在机器下面安放容器盛油，加油时注意不使抛洒，使油壶壶嘴同油眼大小适应，注意加油的时间和数量适度，都可以减少浪费。在交通运输方面，合理组织运输，争取满载、双程，逐步减少回空率；推广并继续研究改进汽车抗爆器；严格执行汽车保养制度；都可以大大降低耗油定额。
    为了节约石油，厂、矿要加强对废油的利用，供应部门要加强废油的回收工作。根据一般情况，回收废油百分之二十到三十是完全可能的。这些废油经过加工再制，仍然可以使用。
    对一般非生产性用油，应该实行严格的节约。机关、团体车辆应该有合理的管理制度，统一使用，控制不必要的行车，反对浪费。机关、团体的交通车和大卡车也应根据地区具体情况，逐步地有计划地实行统一管理、统一使用，以减少空载。对于那些贪图个人享受的浪费用车行为，应给予严格的批评。
    国家分配部门和供应部门应该经常了解用油单位对各种油品的使用情况；有重点地配合厂矿企业的工人和工程技术人员，分析各型机器的耗油定额，研究节约办法；在调查研究的基础上，认真地审核各单位的用油计划，合理供应。对浪费石油的行为，要及时揭发并协助和督促有关单位加以纠正。必须改变只管供应、不认真审核或者认为“供应部门管不着”的想法。国营石油公司必须做好油品的保管、运输工作，尽最大努力不断降低损耗。油槽车卸车时要尽量卸干净。
    节约用油的潜力是很大的。广大群众的智慧就是无穷的潜力。例如郑州国棉一厂试行了勤加少加、改用油坯加油法的节约措施后，每月的耗油量从一百九十公斤降低至一百公斤左右，减少了百分之四十一。加强管理，控制使用，也可以挖掘出巨大的潜力。如国家计划委员会采取了统一使用汽车、适当控制的管理办法，在已经减少了百分之三十二汽油的基础上，又减少了使用量的百分之六十二。
    为了扩大节约用油的效果，工业、交通运输等主管部门和国家供应部门应该注意及时介绍、推广先进经验，对节约有显著成绩的单位，应给予必要的奖励。对严重的浪费行为必须加以揭发并进行斗争。
