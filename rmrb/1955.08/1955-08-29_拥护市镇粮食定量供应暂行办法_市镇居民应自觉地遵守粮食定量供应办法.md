Endorse the Provisional Measures for Rationed Grain Supply in Municipalities and Towns
Municipal and Town Residents Should Consciously Abide by the Measures for Rationed Grain Supply
Zhong Qiu

The Provisional Measures for Rationed Grain Supply in Municipalities and Towns, promulgated by the State Council, will soon be universally implemented in all municipalities and towns across the country. All municipal and town residents should consciously abide by them and help the government to implement them.

The measures for rationed grain supply are determined based on the principle of both meeting the needs of municipal and town residents' lives and conserving grain. These measures have detailed and reasonable provisions for the supply standards, supply procedures, etc., for the rationed grain of municipal and town residents. The supply standards for residents' rations are determined based on labor differences, age, and different regions' grain consumption habits. Each supply grade also stipulates a quantitative range, so that localities can make specific regulations within the quantitative range according to their needs. These measures have detailed provisions in terms of procedures and methods for municipal and town residents eating out or traveling, for population changes and flows such as weddings, births, deaths, separations, co-residences, and relocations, for the special grain needs of rural residents coming to and from towns, and for ethnic minority festivals. If municipal and town residents have surplus rations purchased according to the quantitative standards, they can freely transfer, donate, mutually adjust, or sell them to state-owned grain stores, etc.

The division of supply grades and the supply standards for different grades are suitable for the needs of various people in municipalities and towns and are reasonable. According to a survey of actual grain consumption of more than 15,000 people in Shanghai, the average monthly grain consumption of heavy manual laborers is 38 jin, while the measures stipulate 35 to 44 jin; the average monthly grain consumption of light manual laborers is 30.49 jin, while the supply figures stipulated in the measures are 26 to 34 jin. The average actual grain consumption is generally lower than the average stipulated in the measures. The figures for residents' verified grain consumption in several districts of Beijing are also mostly lower than the supply standards stipulated in the measures. This means that, according to the provisions of the measures, the vast majority of urban people can get enough rations, and some even have a surplus. Of course, it is also possible that individual people with larger appetites or other reasons may feel a little "tight" when using grain according to the supply standards, but as long as they can practice strict economy, overcome waste, and mutually adjust with those who have surplus grain, the problem can be completely solved.

The state has conducted a long period of investigation and careful consideration in order to formulate scientific quantitative supply measures. From the various specific provisions of these measures, people can see how much the state cares about the various different needs of municipal and town residents. The state has taken into account both the long-term interests of the people—socialist construction—and the current living needs of the people. The realization of these measures is of great benefit to the arrangement of the lives of municipal and town residents and to the progress of national economic construction. Therefore, every patriotic and law-abiding resident should consciously guarantee the implementation of these measures with the attitude of being the master of the country.

How should municipal and town residents guarantee the implementation of the measures for rationed grain supply?

First of all, every municipal and town resident should correctly understand the necessity and benefits of implementing these measures, eliminate all ideological concerns, and actively publicize and explain them to others so that all residents understand the significance of these measures. It is necessary to understand that only by implementing rationed supply can the loopholes in urban grain waste be blocked, the rational supply of grain be guaranteed, and the quantity of unified purchase from farmers be stabilized. It should be recognized that the rationed grain supply in municipalities and towns is an important measure conducive to socialist construction; anything that is beneficial to socialism and beneficial to the people will be sabotaged by the enemies of the people. All municipal and town residents should trust the Party and the People's Government, believe in the benefits of this measure for themselves and the country, and promptly expose the rumors and sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements, and block any loopholes that bad elements can exploit. Secondly, all municipal and town residents should strictly abide by the various provisions in the measures, help the government to properly classify grades, purchase grain according to the regulations, and do a good job in adjusting. Those who have more grain according to the quantitative standards can adjust it to others or sell it to state-owned grain stores, but must not engage in grain speculation. In the event of population changes such as births, deaths, marriages, and relocations, it is necessary to truthfully report household registration and complete the procedures to ensure the smooth implementation of the measures for rationed grain supply. Again, after the implementation of rationed supply, it is also necessary to continue to conserve grain, oppose waste, and actively promote various effective conservation methods to save more grain for the country.

The "rationing by head" grain supply method is a major event that changes the people's living habits of many years. When starting to implement this method, it is difficult to avoid that some municipal and town residents feel unaccustomed and inconvenient. It must be understood that although the provisions of the measures are specific and detailed, and the supply standards meet the needs of people in various different situations, there are still certain constraints and limitations after all. In the process of grading and quantifying, some specific problems will inevitably occur. Under such circumstances, on the one hand, municipal and town staff are required to do a good job in grading and quantifying, so that the classified grades are in line with the actual situation of municipal and town residents; on the other hand, municipal and town residents should also actively overcome difficulties so that their living habits can adapt to the new situation and new requirements. In the past few months, in the process of implementing the plan to verify grain consumption by household, many municipal and town residents have saved grain and rationally arranged their family's economic life under the guidance of the state plan. They deeply realized the benefits of saving grain for the country and for themselves, and warmly supported this measure. The implementation of the measures for rationed grain supply makes it easier for residents to further arrange their lives according to the established standards. As long as municipal and town residents earnestly implement these measures, they will inevitably gradually get used to this method and further appreciate the benefits of this method. If all residents can consciously implement these measures, the measures for rationed grain supply in municipalities and towns will gradually become a daily routine for municipal and town residents, which is of great benefit to the people and the country.

Our farmers, for the sake of national construction and for the sake of socialism, actively and diligently produce and enthusiastically sell their surplus grain to the state; municipal and town residents should consciously abide by the provisional measures for rationed supply, strive to save grain, and support the country's socialist construction cause. Let us work together, urban and rural people, to contribute our strength to the great cause of socialist construction!

　　拥护市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法
　　市镇居民应自觉地遵守粮食定量供应办法
　　仲秋
    国务院公布的市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法，即将先后在全国各市镇普遍实行。所有市镇居民都应该自觉遵守和帮助政府贯彻执行。
    粮食定量供应办法是依据既要满足市镇居民生活的需要，又要节约粮食的原则确定的。这个办法对市镇居民口粮的供应标准、供应手续等都有详细合理的规定。居民口粮的供应标准，是根据劳动差别、年龄大小以及不同地区的粮食消费习惯确定的。每一供应等别还规定了定量幅度，以便各地在定量幅度范围内根据需要作具体规定。这个办法对市镇居民在外用膳或外出旅行，对婚嫁、出生、死亡、分居、并居、迁居等人口变化流动，对农村居民来往城镇，以及少数民族节日需要的特殊用粮等等，在手续和办法上都有详细的规定。市镇居民依照定量标准所购口粮如有节余，可以自由转让、赠送、互相调剂或卖给国家粮店等。
    供应等别的划分和不同等别的供应标准，是适合市镇各种不同人的需要的，是合理的。据上海市在一万五千多人中所作的实际用粮量的调查，一般重体力劳动者每月平均用粮三十八斤，办法中规定是三十五至四十四斤；轻体力劳动者每月平均用粮三十点四九斤，办法中规定的供应数字是二十六至三十四斤。实际用粮平均数一般都低于办法中规定的平均数。北京市几个区居民核实用粮的数字，绝大多数也低于办法中规定的供应标准。这就是说，按照办法的规定，绝大多数城镇人民都可以得到足够的口粮，部分且有剩余。当然，也可能有个别食量较大或其他原因按供应标准用粮感到有些
  “紧”的，但只要能厉行节约，克服浪费，并同有余粮的人相互调剂，是完全可以解决问题的。
    国家为了制定科学的定量供应办法，进行了长时间的调查和周密的考虑。从这一办法的各项具体规定中，人们可以看到国家是多么关心市镇居民的各种不同的需要。国家既考虑到人民的长远利益——社会主义建设，也考虑到人民当前的生活需要。实现这一办法，对市镇居民生活的安排，对国家经济建设的进行，都是有极大好处的。因此，每一个爱国守法的居民都应该自觉地以国家主人翁的态度来保证这一办法的贯彻。
    市镇居民应该怎样来保证粮食定量供应办法的实施呢？
    首先，每个市镇居民都应该正确认识实行这一办法的必要和好处，消除一切思想顾虑，并且积极向别人宣传解释，使所有居民都了解这一办法的意义。要懂得只有实行定量供应，才可以堵塞城市浪费粮食的漏洞，保证粮食的合理供应，稳定对农民统购的数量。应该认识，市镇粮食定量供应是一项有利于社会主义建设的重要措施；凡是有利于社会主义、有利于人民的事情，人民的敌人就要进行破坏，所有市镇居民应该相信党和人民政府，相信这个办法对自己对国家的好处，及时揭露反革命分子的造谣破坏，堵住坏分子任何可钻的空子。其次，所有市镇居民都应该严格遵守办法中的各项规定，帮助政府划好等级，按照规定购买粮食，并做好调剂工作。按定量标准，自己粮食有多的，可以调剂给别人，也可以卖给国家粮店，但不得进行粮食投机。如有生死、嫁娶、迁移等人口变动情况，要实报户口办好手续，保证粮食定量供应办法的顺利实行。再次，实行定量供应以后，还应该继续节约粮食，反对浪费，积极推行各种行之有效的节约办法，为国家节约更多的粮食。
    “以人定量”的粮食供应办法是一件改变人民多年生活习惯的大事。在开始实行这个办法的时候，有些市镇居民感到不习惯，不方便，是很难避免的。必须了解，尽管办法的规定具体细致，供应标准合乎各种不同情况的人的需要，但毕竟还是有一定约束和限制的。在分等定量的过程中，也难免不会发生一些具体问题。在这种情况下，一方面要求市镇工作人员要作好分等定量工作，使划分的等级切合市镇居民的实际情况，另一方面，市镇居民也应积极地克服困难，使自己的生活习惯能适应新的情况和新的要求。过去几个月来，在实行按户核实用粮计划的过程中，不少市镇居民在国家计划的指导下，节约了粮食，合理地安排了家庭的经济生活。他们深深体会到节约用粮对国家对自己的好处，热烈拥护这一措施。粮食定量供应办法的实施，更便于居民依照既定标准进一步安排自己的生活。市镇居民只要认真执行这一办法，必然会逐渐习惯于这种办法，进一步体会到这种办法的好处。如果全体居民都能自觉地执行这一办法，市镇粮食定量供应办法就会逐渐成为市镇居民的一种日常生活习惯，这对人民对国家都有极大的好处。
    我国的农民为了国家建设，为了社会主义，积极勤劳生产，踊跃地把余粮卖给国家；市镇居民应该自觉地遵守定量供应暂行办法，努力节约粮食，支持国家的社会主义建设事业。城乡人民共同努力，为美好的社会主义建设事业贡献我们的力量吧！
