    When the Turpan Grapes Ripen
    By our reporter Shen Shi
    In July, Turpan is at its hottest, and also when the grapes ripen.
    In Grape Valley Township and Shahezi Township, not far from Turpan County, the sparkling grapes in every household's vineyard attract the attention of passersby. Passing under the grape trellises, the fragrance emitted by the ripe grapes permeates the heart and lungs.
    In early July, the outdoor temperature in the Turpan Basin reaches 45-46 degrees Celsius, and the hot wind from the Gobi Desert rushes like flames. In this hot season, the hardworking Uyghur farmers do not hide in cellars to cool off; they still work diligently in the fields from dawn till dusk.
    This year, the Turpan County Agricultural Technology Station has dispatched agricultural technicians to various grape-producing townships. Under their guidance, the opening of the soil around the roots for more than 7,900 mu of grapes in the county was done half a month earlier than in 1954. In the past, farmers used to apply manure after opening the soil; doing so after the vines had spread easily damaged the main vines. This year, more than 20,000 of the 24,400 grape mounds in Shahezi Township were fertilized before the soil was opened. In the past, farmers only pruned dead branches when the grapes sprouted, which often damaged the young buds. This year, the grapes were pruned of dead branches before sprouting. This year, work such as cultivating and weeding, topdressing, and building trellises has also been strengthened. Due to improved farming techniques, this year's grapes will have a good harvest.

### 吐鲁番葡萄熟了的时候

    吐鲁番葡萄熟了的时候
    本报记者　沈石
    七月，吐鲁番正是酷热的时候，也正是葡萄成熟的时候。
    离吐鲁番县城不远的葡萄沟乡和沙河子乡，家家户户的葡萄园里，亮晶晶的葡萄，吸引着行人的注目。人们经过葡萄架下，成熟的葡萄发出的清香，沁透心脾。
    七月上旬，吐鲁番盆地室外的气温达到摄氏四十五、六度，戈壁滩上的热风，一阵阵地像火焰一样扑来。在这炎热的季节里，勤劳的维吾尔族农民并没有躲到地窖里去纳凉，他们仍然是起早睡晚地忙碌在田间。
    今年，吐鲁番县农业技术站在盛产葡萄的各乡，派出了农业技术人员。在他们的指导下，全县七千九百多亩葡萄，开墩的时间比一九五四年提早了半个月。过去，农民们习惯于在开墩以后上粪，这样蔓摆开了再上粪，容易损伤主蔓。今年，沙河子乡二万四千四百多墩葡萄，有两万墩在开墩以前上了粪。过去，农民们只是在葡萄发芽的时候，攀掉枯枝，这样往往损伤幼芽，今年的葡萄都在发芽前修剪了枯枝。中耕除草、追肥、搭架等工作，今年也加强了。由于改进了耕作技术，今年的葡萄将获得好的收成。
