Great Waste in a Small Hospital

To the Editor:

The Hangu Saltworks Employees' Hospital is funded by employee welfare funds and serves only the employees and their families of the saltworks. Although this hospital is small in scale, the waste is considerable. Due to blind purchasing, twenty-one kinds of ophthalmic, surgical, and obstetrical medical equipment, worth more than 3,000 yuan, purchased since 1953, have never been used. The hospital has 113 kinds of medicines, but only 26 kinds are actually used, and the rest have been stockpiled for a long time. The administrative expenses of the hospital are also very wasteful. The accumulated forms are enough to last for about seven years, including "Ophthalmology Medical Record First Page," 30,000 "Saltworker Family Treatment Certificates," and a large number of medical record bags, medical record supplementary pages, prescription slips, and outpatient tickets.

In April of this year, the relevant leading departments such as the Hangu Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted an inspection of the waste situation in the hospital and put forward suggestions for improvement. However, the hospital's extravagance and wastefulness have not been corrected. In June, in order to pursue beauty, they painted the walls everywhere with green mixed paint; due to unsuitable materials, the paint that had just been applied peeled off completely. The phenomenon of blind purchasing has not stopped. The hospital originally had wooden medical record folders, but now they have all been replaced with stainless steel ones. Because the operating room needs to be sprayed with water on the floor when patients undergo surgery (at most once a week), they bought more than a dozen pairs of rubber shoes.

The waste in this hospital cannot continue. The leading staff of the hospital should make a profound self-criticism.

### 小医院的大浪费

　  小医院的大浪费编辑同志：
    汉沽盐场职工医院是用职工福利费办的，只为本场的职工和家属服务。这个医院规模虽小，但是浪费却很大。由于盲目购置，从一九五三年买来后一次也没有用过的眼科、外科和妇产科的医疗器械共二十一种，价值三千多元。医院里有药品一百十三种，但实际用的只有二十六种，其它都是长期积压着。医院的行政开支浪费也很大，积压的表册就有够用七年左右的“眼科病历首页”、三万个“盐工家属治疗证”和大批的病历袋、病历副页、处方单、门诊券等。
    今年四月，中共汉沽市委等有关的领导部门曾对这个医院的浪费情形作了检查，并提出了改进的意见。但是，医院的铺张浪费情形并没有得到纠正。六月份，他们为了追求美观，把各处的墙壁刷上绿色调和漆；由于材料不合适，刚刚刷上的油漆就全部剥落了。盲目购置的现象也没有停止。医院原有木制病历夹，现在都换成不锈钢的。手术室因为病人动手术时地上要喷水（每星期顶多只一次），就买了十几双胶鞋。
    这个医院的浪费现象不能再继续下去了。医院的领导工作人员应该作深刻的检讨。
