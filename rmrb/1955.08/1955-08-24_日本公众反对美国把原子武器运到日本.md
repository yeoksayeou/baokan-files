　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 22nd: The U.S. Far East Army Command announced on the 22nd that the Fifth Field Artillery Team, equipped with "Honest John" atomic rocket launchers, and the attached 261st Ordnance Detachment had arrived in Japan last weekend.

　　According to Kyodo News, these two units are used by the United States as directly controlled offensive forces. Therefore, they are stationed in Asaka (west of Tokyo), where the headquarters of the U.S. Forces in the Far East is located.

　　Kyodo News also revealed that the Japanese "Defense Agency" had long received a notice from the U.S. Far East military authorities stating that the Fifth Field Artillery Team would arrive in Yokohama on the 20th, and requested the Japanese side to "keep it secret" before the matter was publicly announced. After the announcement, the Director General of the "Defense Agency," Shigemasa Sunada, publicly stated that the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" are planning to learn how to operate this new weapon.

　　The U.S. move to transport atomic weapons to Japan has aroused opposition from the Japanese public.

　　Soji Okada, Director of the Education and Propaganda Bureau of the Left-wing Socialist Party, condemned this behavior by the United States, pointing out that atomic weapons are offensive weapons. The entry of these weapons into Japan increases the risk of dragging Japan into an atomic war. He emphasized that the United States turning Japan into an atomic war base is already becoming a reality.

　　Okada stated that the Left-wing Socialist Party will fight to ensure that the U.S. military withdraws from Japan as soon as possible, and takes away the atomic rocket launchers without giving them to the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces."

　　日本公众反对美国把原子武器运到日本
    新华社二十二日讯　东京消息：美国远东陆军司令部二十二日宣布，装备着“诚实的约翰”原子火箭发射器的第五野战炮兵队和附属的第二百六十一军械分遣队已经在上周末到达日本。
    据共同社说，这两支部队是美国作为直辖的进攻部队使用的。因此，它们驻扎在远东美军总司令部所在地的朝霞（东京西部）。
    共同社还透露，日本“防卫厅”早就接到远东美军当局的通知说，第五野战炮兵队在二十日到达横滨，并且要求日本方面在这件事没有公开宣布以前“保守秘密”。事情公布后，“防卫厅”长官砂田重政公开表示，日本“自卫队”正计划学习操纵这种新武器。
    美国把原子武器运到日本的举措引起了日本公众的反对。
    左派社会党教育宣传局长冈田宗司谴责美国这种行为时指出：原子武器是攻击性的武器。这些武器运入日本，增加了把日本卷入原子战争的危险。他强调说，美国把日本变成原子战争基地已经在成为事实。
    冈田表示，左派社会党要进行斗争，使美国军队尽早撤出日本，并且带走原子火箭发射器而不把它们给予日本“自卫队”。
