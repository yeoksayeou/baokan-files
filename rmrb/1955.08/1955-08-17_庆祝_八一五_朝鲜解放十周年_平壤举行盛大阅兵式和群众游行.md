Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 16th: To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the liberation of Korea on "August 15th," the democratic capital of Korea, Pyongyang, held a grand military parade and a mass procession of over 300,000 people on the 15th.

In the early morning, the troops to be reviewed were already neatly lined up in Kim Il-sung Square. Pyongyang citizens, holding flags and bouquets, gathered towards the city center singing songs.

At exactly 10:00 a.m., Marshal Kim Il-sung and leaders of the Korean Workers' Party and government, accompanied by A. B. Aristov, head of the Soviet government delegation invited to Korea to participate in the celebration, Zhu De, head of the Chinese delegation, all members of the Soviet and Chinese delegations, and Yang Yong, commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, ascended the reviewing stand. At this moment, the people in the square cheered and applauded enthusiastically.

The military parade began. Vice Marshal Choi Yong-kun, Minister of National Defense of Korea, reviewed the troops of various services of the People's Army by car. After the review, he delivered a speech, calling on all officers and soldiers of the People's Army to improve their military and political level, vigilantly monitor the aggressive forces attempting to carry out adventurous actions, and defend the peaceful labor of the people.

Then, the march-past began. At the forefront were the students of the Korean People's Army Officer School, followed by the students of various military schools and academies. After that came the tank units, motorized units, and artillery units of the People's Army. At the same time, in the air, the fighter jets and destroyers of the People's Army Air Force flew across the sky in neat formations at lightning speed. The Korean people responded with enthusiastic cheers to this armed force that had undergone glorious tests and firmly defended the motherland.

After the military parade, the mass procession began. A contingent of 5,000 labor heroes and production innovators marched at the front of the procession, followed by columns of children, students, workers, farmers, government employees, artists, and athletes. As the marching masses passed in front of the reviewing stand, they held up flowers and enthusiastically cheered and paid tribute to Marshal Kim Il-sung, the leaders of the Korean Workers' Party, government, and army, and the delegations from the Soviet Union and China.

The marching teams held aloft huge banners reading "Salute to the liberator and helper of the Korean people—the great Soviet Union" and "The Korean issue must be resolved by the Korean people themselves," as well as portraits of leaders from Korea, the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries.

The marching masses carried many charts and models, showing the tremendous achievements they had made in the cause of rebuilding their country. Construction workers from Pyongyang City held up a drawing of Putongmun Street in Pyongyang, which they had completed, along with many buildings on both sides of the street, before "August 15th" this year. The charts held up by the workers of the Pyongyang Textile Factory showed that the total output value of the Pyongyang Textile Factory this year will reach more than four times that of 1953.

The cheers, slogans, and songs of the marching masses reverberated throughout Pyongyang. People celebrated to their hearts' content the great achievements they had made in the ten years since liberation. The procession ended at 1:30 p.m.
