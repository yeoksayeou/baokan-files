Xinhua News Agency, August 20th. The British Friendly Delegation to China, composed of people from all walks of life in Britain at the invitation of Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, attended a banquet tonight and met with many prominent figures from all walks of life in China.

　　This reception was held jointly by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations With Foreign Countries, and the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace to welcome the delegation's visit to China. The banquet was presided over by Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations With Foreign Countries.

　　Chu Tunan said in his welcoming speech: This visit to China by the British Friendly Delegation at the invitation of Mr. Guo Moruo is a gratifying event in the development of friendly relations between the Chinese and British peoples. We Chinese have an old saying: "Is it not delightful to have friends coming from afar?" This sentence precisely expresses our feelings of welcoming you here today.

　　Chu Tunan told the guests that the Chinese people are working hard for the peaceful construction of their country and for the realization of the first Five-Year Plan. During your visit to our country, you will see many facts about the Chinese people's love of peace and their efforts to carry out peaceful construction. He also said that we have only been building our country for more than five years, and large-scale industrial construction has only started for two years. We have many difficulties and many shortcomings. We must learn with humility, especially from our friends from countries with developed industrial technology. Therefore, we sincerely hope that you will give us more criticism and guidance during your visit, which will be helpful to us. We believe that through your visit, the understanding and friendship between our two peoples will be further deepened.

　　Maurice Orbach, head of the British Friendly Delegation to China, gave a speech, expressing his gratitude to Guo Moruo for inviting them to visit and see "this beautiful country." He said: "We have only been in China for a few days, and we have already seen that the Chinese people have a forward momentum in life and are full of infinite confidence and hope for the construction of their motherland." He said: "We bring to the Chinese people the congratulations, goodwill, and friendship of the British people, as well as the desire for peace." He raised his glass to toast the consolidation of the friendship between the British and Chinese peoples and the realization of the common desire to defend peace.

　　Attending the banquet tonight were well-known figures from all walks of life in China, including Tao Menghe, Zhao Yimin, Yang Hansheng, Liao Chengzhi, Xu Baoju, Liu Guanyi, Zhu Xuefan, Li Dequan, Wu Han, Chen Hansheng, Hu Yuzhi, Qian Duansheng, Deng Chenxi, Ji Chaoding, and others.

　　After the banquet, the guests also enjoyed the wonderful performances of Chinese acrobats.
