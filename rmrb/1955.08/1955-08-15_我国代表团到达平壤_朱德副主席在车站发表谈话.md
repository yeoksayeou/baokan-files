More than 20,000 Pyongyang citizens gathered in the square in front of the station, holding colorful flags and bouquets, singing and excitedly awaiting the arrival of the delegation.

    "Respected Premier Comrade,
    Respected Comrades and Friends,

    The delegation of the People's Republic of China has come here with the most sincere friendship of the Chinese people to celebrate the grand festival of the 10th anniversary of the liberation of Korea together with the heroic Korean people, and we feel infinite joy and honor. Please allow me, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Chinese people, to extend warm congratulations and high respect to the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, and the entire Korean people.

    As soon as we set foot on your land, we saw everywhere the great efforts made by the Korean people in rebuilding their happy homeland. The heroic struggle of the Korean people irrefutably proves that a nation that has already taken the destiny of the country into its own hands and dares to give a strong blow to the invaders for the independence and honor of the motherland is invincible, and there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome in front of it.

    The people of China and Korea have a traditional and profound friendship. This friendship has been further consolidated and developed in the common struggle of the two peoples against aggression and in defense of peace. The Chinese people deeply sympathize with and wholeheartedly support the just struggle of the Korean people to strive for the establishment of a peaceful, unified, and independent Korea. We wish you further achievements in this great cause.

    Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!
    Long live the heroic Korean people and the Korean Workers' Party!
    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and Korea!"

    Vice Chairman Zhu De's speech was interrupted several times by the cheers of the crowd. They shouted, "Welcome the delegation of the People's Republic of China!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and Korea!"

    Subsequently, Marshal Kim Il-sung invited Vice Chairman Zhu De and the members of the delegation to board the car and, accompanied by Vice Premier Kim Il and others, went to the guesthouse to rest. The delegation was greeted by Pyongyang citizens lining the streets along the way.

    七时正，代表团专车在欢迎者的热烈掌声和欢呼声中徐徐进站。朱德副主席下车后，和金日成元帅等亲切、热情地握手，并介绍代表团团员和金日成元帅及欢迎者见面。这时，经久不息的雷动掌声和欢呼声响彻整个车站。
