Xinhua News Agency, August 10th—Li Zhongyi, Counselor of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea Embassy in China, stated at a press conference today that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is now effectively implementing the Three-Year Plan for the People's Economy, and both urban and rural areas are gradually showing a new face.

The press conference today was held by Cui Yi, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the liberation of Korea by the Soviet Army.

Li Zhongyi introduced to Chinese and foreign journalists the struggle of the Korean people to restore the national economy after the realization of the Korean armistice.

Li Zhongyi said that in the two years since the armistice, more than sixty newly built large and medium-sized industrial enterprises in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have been put into production. More than two hundred and thirty industrial enterprises damaged in the war have been put into production after being restored and rebuilt. In the first half of 1955, the total industrial output value of state-owned and cooperative enterprises increased by 2.5 times compared with the first half of 1953. The average monthly production level in the first half of this year increased by 43 percent compared with the same period in 1949. In the backbone of industry—the heavy industry sector—many new products such as new-type lathes and DC generators have been produced.

Li Zhongyi also said that millions of chongbo (unit of land measurement) of cultivated land have been restored and expanded in the two years after the war, and great achievements have also been made in water conservancy construction. As of the end of June 1955, 11,529 agricultural production cooperatives had been established, encompassing 44 percent of all farm households and owning 42 percent of all cultivated land.

Li Zhongyi then talked about the tremendous achievements in the construction of transportation, cultural, and educational undertakings in the past two years.

Li Zhongyi also pointed out the suffering of the South Korean people who are being tormented by hunger and poverty.

Li Zhongyi said that the Korean people all yearn for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

More than forty Chinese and foreign journalists attended the reception.
