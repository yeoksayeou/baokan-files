Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 11th - The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement:

    On August 1, 1955, the Syngman Rhee clique announced that it would take action to seize the area north of the Military Demarcation Line and south of the 38th parallel and demanded the withdrawal of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission personnel from South Korea. Subsequently, on August 5, it sent a provocative statement to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, demanding in a violent manner that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission personnel stationed in South Korea withdraw within a limited time, and declared that it would not be responsible for the consequences of any Neutral Nations personnel who did not comply with this request.

    This attempt to undermine the Armistice Agreement is not the first. Since the Korean Armistice, under the instigation and protection of the United States, they have threatened the personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission with various acts of violence, attempting to dissolve the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in order to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement.

    Recently, this instigation has become even more blatant. Following the issuance of the Syngman Rhee clique's provocative statement, a series of atrocities, instigated by the United States, have threatened the safety of the Neutral Nations Inspection Team personnel and hindered their work.

    Both sides of the Armistice bear full responsibility for ensuring the safety of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission personnel and their activities in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement. However, the United Nations Command has not taken effective and responsible measures to address the serious provocative incidents occurring in the areas under its jurisdiction, and as a result, the situation is gradually deteriorating.

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea draws the serious attention of the United Nations Command and the governments of the relevant countries on the United Nations Command side to this grave situation and demands thorough compliance with the clear provisions of the Armistice Agreement, with the responsibility for ensuring the safety of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and all its affiliated agencies' personnel and the performance of duties stipulated in the Armistice Agreement.

    If acts of violence continue to be perpetrated against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission personnel in the future, the United Nations Command must bear full responsibility for all consequences arising therefrom.

    Since the realization of the Armistice, although hindered by the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has played a positive role in ensuring compliance with the Armistice Agreement. Therefore, in order to consolidate the Korean Armistice and safeguard peace, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission must be maintained, and any attempt to undermine it cannot be tolerated.

    The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has the obligation to uphold its legitimate status and rights as stipulated in the Armistice Agreement and to oppose all obstruction and sabotage conspiracies.

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will fully support the efforts of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to fulfill its obligations.

    The Korean Armistice has created the possibility for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, representing the unanimous desire of the entire Korean people, has made every effort for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and has repeatedly put forward reasonable plans for peaceful reunification. However, the Syngman Rhee clique has consistently responded with conspiracies and provocative acts to undermine the Armistice.

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that the Korean issue must be resolved peacefully and hopes that the governments of the relevant countries will convene a Far Eastern conference with broad participation of Asian countries to seek ways to withdraw foreign troops from Korea and to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

    朝鲜外务省发表声明
    新华社平壤十一日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省声明：
    一九五五年八月一日李承晚集团宣布为夺取军事分界线以北三八线以南地区将采取行动，并要求中立国监察委员会人员撤离南朝鲜。随后于八月五日又以一项挑衅性的声明送交中立国监察委员会，横暴地要求驻在南朝鲜的中立国监察委员会人员限期撤走，并声称对不顺应这一要求的中立国人员发生的后果不能负责。
    这一破坏停战协定的企图决不是第一次。朝鲜停战以来他们在美国的唆使和庇护下，以各种暴力行动威胁过中立国监察委员会人员，企图解散中立国监察委员会以破坏朝鲜停战协定。
    最近以来这种策动更加露骨。李承晚集团的挑衅性的声明发表以后，在美国的怂恿之下组织的一连串的暴行，威胁着中立国视察小组人员的安全，并阻挠着他们的工作。
    停战双方负有完全保证对中立国监察委员会人员的安全和他们根据停战协定的规定进行的活动。但是联合国军方面对在他们管辖地区内发生着的严重的挑衅事件，未采取有效的负责的措施，因之目前的情况还在逐渐恶化。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府就这一严重局势提醒联合国军方面及联合国军方面的有关各国政府严重注意，并要求彻底遵守停战协定的明确的规定，负责保证中立国监察委员会及其一切所属机构人员的安全和执行停战协定所规定的职务。
    如果今后继续对中立国监察委员会人员施加暴行，由此产生的一切后果必须由联合国军方面负全部责任。
    停战实现后，虽然由于美国和李承晚集团的阻挠，但中立国监察委员会在保障停战协定的遵守方面是起了肯定的作用的。因此，为了巩固朝鲜停战，维护和平，中立国监察委员会必须得到维护，任何加以破坏的企图都是不能容许的。
    中立国监察委员会有义务坚持停战协定所规定的合法地位和权利，反对一切阻挠和破坏阴谋。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府对中立国监察委员会为履行其义务所作的努力，将予以完全支持。
    朝鲜停战为朝鲜问题的和平解决创造了可能性。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表全朝鲜人民的一致愿望，为朝鲜问题的和平解决尽了一切努力，屡次提出了合理的和平统一方案。但是李承晚集团却一贯以破坏停战的阴谋和挑衅行为来回答。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为朝鲜问题必须和平解决，并希望有关各国政府召开有亚洲国家广泛参加的远东会议谋求从朝鲜撤退外国军队和和平解决朝鲜问题的途径。
