Welcome, Albanian Cultural Envoys
Yang Xiandong, Vice Minister of Agriculture, People's Republic of China

The Cultural Delegation of the People's Republic of Albania, headed by Comrade Fadil Paçrami, arrived in Beijing on the 11th. In a few days, the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe will also come to our country for a performance tour. The Albanian people have specially sent their cultural envoys from afar to our country in order to further strengthen the fraternal friendship with the Chinese people. This is something that the people of our country should be very excited about. Having been to Albania, I would like to extend a particularly warm welcome to the Albanian friends who are visiting our country this time.

The Albanian people are a nation with glorious revolutionary traditions. The history of Albania is full of just struggles against national and social oppression. No matter how brutal the enemy or how great the sacrifices, the Albanian people have never succumbed. Under the influence of the great victory of the Soviet army in defeating the German fascist aggressors, the Albanian people finally gained complete independence and freedom. Today's Albania is an unbreakable link in the powerful camp of peace and democracy. The Albanian people are closely united with the people of the Soviet Union and other fraternal people's democratic countries, fighting for peace and socialism.

In recent years, the Albanian people have achieved tremendous achievements on the road to building a new life. Albania's industry, agriculture and the entire national economy have developed rapidly. On the basis of economic development, the cultural life of the Albanian people has also undergone significant changes. Whether in cities or villages, the cultural revolution has had a profound impact. In the past, more than 80% of the Albanian population was illiterate. This year, the last group of illiterates in Albania will be eliminated. The number of students in primary, secondary and higher education has more than doubled compared to pre-war levels. In the past, Albania never had a single institution of higher learning. Now six institutions of higher learning have been established, and the first batch of experts have been trained this year. The scientific research institutes established after liberation are also effectively carrying out research work, contributing to Albania's socialist economic construction. Albania's literary and artistic undertakings have also flourished in recent years. Excellent literary and artistic works reflecting the glorious struggle and socialist construction of the Albanian people continue to emerge, enriching the cultural life of the Albanian people and encouraging them to work harder for a better future.

Under the guidance of a common ideology—Marxism-Leninism—and inspired by a common goal—peace and socialism—the people of China and Albania have forged an unbreakable friendship. The relationship between our people and the Albanian people, like that with the people of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, can be said to be as close as brothers and sisters. Thanks to the efforts of our two governments and peoples, friendly cooperation and cultural exchanges between China and Albania have been developing day by day in recent years. In 1952, the Chinese Youth Art Troupe visited Albania for a performance tour, bringing the Chinese people's love and respect for the Albanian people to the Albanian people. The two countries have also held many exhibitions, translated and published books, and exchanged students. In September 1954, the two countries exchanged ambassadors, and shortly thereafter signed four agreements aimed at strengthening friendly cooperation between our two countries. Among them, the cultural cooperation agreement stipulates further strengthening and expanding cultural relations between our two countries. According to the 1955 implementation plan of this agreement, the Albanian government sent a cultural delegation and the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe to visit and perform in our country. This is undoubtedly a sign of new progress in the friendly relations between the people of China and Albania.

In November 1954, I accompanied Vice Premier Li Xiannian to Albania to participate in the celebration of the 10th anniversary of Albania's liberation. During the days of national jubilation in Albania, we visited Albanian cities and villages, visited industry and agriculture, and personally witnessed the brilliant achievements made by the Albanian people in developing their economy and culture. We were equally delighted for the beautiful life of the Albanian people. In Tirana and Korçë, we also saw the Albanian opera "Dawn" and many beautiful folk songs and dances, which reflected the optimism and heroism of the Albanian people and left us with a very deep impression and memory.

I believe that this visit and performance by the Albanian cultural delegation will not only enable the Albanian people to better understand the various aspects of the Chinese people's struggle to build socialism—especially the cultural aspect—but also provide the broad masses of our people with the opportunity to understand and appreciate Albanian culture and art. The Albanian cultural representatives will introduce to us the achievements and experiences of the Albanian people in developing cultural and educational undertakings, and the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe will show us the heroic fighting spirit of the Albanian people and their happy life today through vivid artistic images. They will enable us to better understand our distant but close Albanian brothers and enhance the friendship and cooperation between our two peoples. Here, we wish our Albanian friends success in their visit and performances in China.

### 欢迎阿尔巴尼亚的文化使节们

    欢迎阿尔巴尼亚的文化使节们
    中华人民共和国农业部副部长　杨显东
    以法迪尔·帕奇拉米同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国文化代表团，已经于十一日抵达北京。再过几天，阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团也将来到我国作访问演出。阿尔巴尼亚人民为了进一步加强同中国人民的兄弟般的友谊，特地派遣自己的文化使节远道前来我国。这是值得我国人民感到十分兴奋的事情。曾经到过阿尔巴尼亚的我，对这次来我国访问的阿尔巴尼亚朋友们特别表示热烈的欢迎。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民是一个具有光荣的革命传统的民族。在阿尔巴尼亚的历史上，充满着反对民族压迫和社会压迫的正义斗争。不管敌人是多么的残暴，牺牲是多么的重大，阿尔巴尼亚人民从来也没有屈服过。在苏联军队打败德国法西斯侵略者的伟大胜利的影响下，阿尔巴尼亚人民终于获得了完全的独立和自由。今天的阿尔巴尼亚是强大的和平民主阵营的牢不可破的一环。阿尔巴尼亚人民正在同苏联和各兄弟人民民主国家的人民紧紧地团结一起，为和平与社会主义事业而斗争。
    这些年来，阿尔巴尼亚人民在建设新生活的道路上已经获得了十分巨大的成就。阿尔巴尼亚的工业、农业和整个国民经济有了迅速的发展。在经济发展的基础上，阿尔巴尼亚人民的文化生活面貌也有了显著的改变。无论在城市或乡村，文化革命已发生了深刻的影响。过去阿尔巴尼亚全国人口的百分之八十以上是文盲。今年，阿尔巴尼亚最后的一批文盲就要扫除了。全国初等、中等和高等学校的学生人数已比战前增加了二倍多。过去的阿尔巴尼亚是从来也没有一所高等学校的。现在已建立了六所高等学校，并且在今年培养出了第一批专家。在解放以后建立起来的科学研究所，也在有效地进行着研究工作，对阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义经济建设作出贡献。阿尔巴尼亚的文学艺术事业这些年来也有了蓬勃的发展。反映阿尔巴尼亚人民光荣斗争和社会主义建设的优秀的文学艺术作品不断出现，它们丰富了阿尔巴尼亚人民的文化生活，并鼓舞阿尔巴尼亚人民更加努力地去争取美好的将来。
    在共同的思想——马克思列宁主义思想——的指导下，在共同的目标——和平与社会主义——的鼓舞下，中阿两国人民已经结成了牢不可破的友谊。我国人民同阿尔巴尼亚人民的关系，和同苏联与其他人民民主国家人民的关系一样，可以说是亲如兄弟，情同手足。由于我们两国政府和人民的努力，中阿两国之间的友好合作和文化交流，这些年来日益发展。一九五二年，我国青年文工团曾去阿尔巴尼亚作访问演出，把中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚人民的热爱和敬意带给阿尔巴尼亚人民。两国还互相举办了不少的展览会，互相译刊书籍，交换留学生。一九五四年九月，两国互派了大使，并在此后不久又签订了旨在加强我们两国友好合作的四个协定。其中文化合作协定规定进一步加强和扩大我们两国之间的文化关系。根据这个协定的一九五五年执行计划，阿尔巴尼亚政府派遣了文化代表团和阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团来到我国访问和演出。这无疑是中阿两国人民友好关系新进展的标志。
    一九五四年十一月，我曾随李先念副总理去阿尔巴尼亚参加了阿尔巴尼亚解放十周年的庆祝典礼。在阿尔巴尼亚举国欢腾的日子里，我们访问了阿尔巴尼亚的城市和乡村，参观了工业和农业，亲眼看到了阿尔巴尼亚人民在发展经济和文化方面所取得的光辉成就，我们为阿尔巴尼亚人民的美好生活而同样感到欢欣。在地拉那和科尔察，我们还看到了阿尔巴尼亚的歌剧“曙光”和许多优美的民间歌舞，它们反映了阿尔巴尼亚人民的乐观和英勇，给我们留下了非常深刻的印象和记忆。
    我相信，阿尔巴尼亚文化代表团这次来我国访问和演出，不仅将使阿尔巴尼亚人民更好地了解我国人民在建设社会主义斗争中的各方面情况——特别是文化方面的情况，而且也将使我国广大人民得到了解和欣赏阿尔巴尼亚的文化和艺术的机会。阿尔巴尼亚的文化代表们将把阿尔巴尼亚人民发展文化教育事业的成就和经验介绍给我们，阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团将通过生动的艺术形象向我们展现出阿尔巴尼亚人民英勇的斗争精神和他们今天的幸福生活。他们将使我们更好地了解我们的遥远而又亲近的阿尔巴尼亚兄弟，增进我们两国人民之间的友谊和合作。在这里，我们预祝阿尔巴尼亚朋友们在中国的访问和演出获得成就。
