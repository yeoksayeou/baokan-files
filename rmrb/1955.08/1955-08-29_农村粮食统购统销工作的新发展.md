Editorial: New Developments in Rural Grain Unified Purchase and Sales Work

The formulation and implementation of the "Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" marks a further development of China's rural grain unified purchase and sales policy. It will make rural grain work more sound on the basis of "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales."

China began implementing the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain in 1953. At that time, the task was heavy, time was tight, and experience was lacking. It was impossible to accurately estimate grain production and the situation of farmers' surplus and shortage of grain. Therefore, it was not possible to formulate a complete and unified national system and method for unified purchase and sale of grain, but only to stipulate some principles for implementing policies and simple and easy-to-implement methods. In the unified purchase and sale of grain in rural areas from 1954 to 1955, various localities had gained some experience and formulated some specific methods after the practice of the previous year. However, on a national scale, these experiences were still immature. In addition, a considerable area suffered severe floods last year. The overall situation of national grain production and needs, farmers' surplus grain, and grain shortages under normal circumstances has not been thoroughly clarified. It is still impossible to formulate a unified system and method that fits the actual situation of the country. That is to say, in the past two years of unified purchase and sale of grain, we mainly relied on sufficient political work, the efforts of the whole party, and the method of issuing control figures from higher levels and mobilizing the masses for democratic appraisal to complete the state's task of unified purchase and sale of grain. Facts have proved that this approach was completely necessary and correct in the past. It was precisely because of this approach that the task of unified purchase and sale of grain in the past two years was successfully completed, the state was able to grasp the source of grain in a timely manner, basically eliminated grain speculation, stabilized the market, and ensured the needs of the people in cities, industrial and mining areas, and rural areas with grain shortages. It guaranteed the needs of farmers in technical crop areas, disaster areas, fishermen, salt farmers, herdsmen, boat people, etc., and guaranteed the needs of national construction and national defense, especially ensuring a smooth transition through the serious famine last year. These great achievements must be affirmed.

Practice over the past two years has proved that the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain must be adhered to, but the methods of unified purchase and sale of grain must be gradually improved on the basis of summarizing existing experience to make them more complete. The main difficulties and shortcomings in the past unified purchase and sale of grain work lie in the lack of a necessary specific system and method to provide a practical basis for grain work. The unified purchase and sale of grain in various localities has not been arranged and combined simultaneously on the basis of clarifying the boundaries between farmers' surplus and shortage of grain. As a result, some unreasonable phenomena have occurred. In terms of grain unified purchase, the grain we purchased from farmers, plus the grain requisitioned, although less than one-third of the national grain output, in some places, the task was not allocated reasonably, so that some farmers did not sell enough surplus grain that they should have sold, while some farmers sold more grain than the limit of surplus grain. In terms of rural grain unified sales, some farmers who should have been supplied were not supplied enough, while many who should not have been supplied were supplied, and some who should have been supplied later were supplied earlier. Farmers are individual small producers. On the one hand, they see the benefits of unified purchase and sale of grain and enthusiastically support this policy, but on the other hand, they are accustomed to freely disposing of their surplus grain in form, and are not accustomed to the state's unified purchase and sale of grain methods. In addition, farmers cannot know the annual purchase and sale figures in advance, so some farmers naturally have the illusion of "bottomless purchase and sale" and "no benefit from increased production." This is one of the important reasons for the rural grain supply tension that once appeared in March and April this year. Therefore, taking effective measures to effectively improve the unified purchase and sale of grain, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and develop agricultural production has become an urgent issue at present.

In March this year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued instructions requesting all localities to announce the state's grain requisition and unified purchase figures for this year to the townships before and after the spring ploughing, and decided to implement the "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" method in the rural grain unified purchase and sale work. The announcement of this "three fixings" method greatly improved the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers. However, because it was about to enter the busy farming season at that time, there was no time to specifically determine the "three fixings" figures to each farmer, so some farmers still felt "unclear" and some concerns were not completely eliminated.

Now, the "Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" issued by the State Council specifically solves the problem of "three fixings" to households; and stipulates the method of "fixed production and fixed purchase" remaining unchanged for three years, and "fixed sales" being evaluated once a year. This new development in rural grain unified purchase and sale work will surely promote greater development of agricultural production and a more consolidated worker-peasant alliance. This method fully demonstrates our country's encouragement of farmers' production enthusiasm and the spirit of actively developing agricultural production. In terms of "fixed production," it is stipulated that the yield per unit area of ​​grain actually planted by farmers shall be used to evaluate, and high estimates of yield are not allowed; after the yield is evaluated, it will remain unchanged for three years under normal years from 1955; newly reclaimed wasteland will not be counted in the yield for three years from the year of harvest. In terms of "fixed purchase," it is stipulated that the amount of grain used by farmers shall be deducted according to their actual needs, and a reasonable single proportion shall be used for the purchase of farmers' surplus grain, instead of progressive purchase; the unified purchase of grain generally accounts for 80% to 90% of farmers' surplus grain, and it is determined that the unified purchase task verified to households this year will remain unchanged for three years, with no increase in purchase for increased production and reduction or exemption for disasters. In terms of "fixed sales," it is stipulated that it shall be evaluated once a year according to the grain production situation and actual needs of grain-deficient farmers, and the state shall effectively guarantee the supply; according to the principle of when grain is deficient and when to supply, the time of supply and the monthly supply plan for each household shall be evaluated separately, and the state grain agency shall uniformly issue supply certificates, and supply shall be carried out "with certificates, monthly, at designated points, and quantitatively." In this way, grain-deficient farmers can know in advance how much grain the state will supply them each year and when to start the supply. On the one hand, they can feel at ease to carry out production, and on the other hand, they can better arrange their annual grain consumption plan.

In order to encourage grain-deficient farmers to work hard in production, the measures also stipulate that when the actual annual yield of all grain fields exceeds the normal yield and the increase target, the state will not deduct the amount of grain supplied; for grain-deficient households that plant technical crops according to the state plan, the state will also give appropriate care, not only stipulating that their ration and feed grain consumption standards are not lower than the grain consumption standards of local surplus grain households; and stipulating that their grain-planted fields will only calculate the normal yield and will not calculate the increase target within three years. All the principles of "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" and the figures of grain requisition, unified purchase, and unified sales must be specifically implemented to every farmer this year. In this way, farmers can reserve a certain amount of surplus grain and calmly arrange their plans for developing agriculture, sideline production, and family life. The more production increases, the more surplus grain is at the disposal of the farmers themselves. In this way, the broad masses of farmers will inevitably develop production more actively and consciously sell surplus grain to the state to support the great cause of socialist industrialization.

The implementation of the "Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" is a new development in rural grain unified purchase and sale work. From then on, in the rural grain unified purchase and sale work, we can adopt the method of combining purchase and sale, dividing the boundaries of surplus and shortage of grain, unified arrangement, and certificate management, so that we can purchase what should be purchased and sell what should be sold, arrange how much to purchase and sell at the same time, and then issue certificates separately, so that surplus grain farmers can handle the remaining grain after completing the unified purchase task without any concerns, and so that the grain needed by grain-deficient farmers can be supplied in a timely manner. With this relatively complete method, the workload of rural grain unified purchase and sale will gradually be reduced, so that party committees and governments at all levels can use less effort and less time to better complete the grain work tasks, and can have more effort and time to strengthen and promote the agricultural cooperation movement and the agricultural production increase movement. It can be seen from this that the formulation and implementation of the "Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" is of great significance not only for improving grain work itself, but also for developing the entire rural work.

Now, some provinces are carrying out the work of "three fixings" of grain to households, and other provinces are also preparing to carry out this work. All localities should vigorously publicize the "Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" to the broad masses of farmers, so that the spirit of the "three fixings" policy is known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. In the future grain unified purchase and sale work, all rural workers must act in strict accordance with this method, effectively improve rural grain unified purchase and sale work, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and ensure the successful realization of the Five-Year Plan.

### 农村粮食统购统销工作的新发展

　　农村粮食统购统销工作的新发展
    “农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”的制定和实施，标志着我国农村粮食统购统销政策进一步的发展，它将使农村粮食工作在
  “定产、定购、定销”的基础上更加健全起来。
    我国从一九五三年开始实行粮食统购统销政策。当时任务繁重，时间紧迫，经验缺乏，一时无法估清粮食产量和农民余粮缺粮的情况。因此，对于粮食统购统销工作，还不可能定出一套完整的全国统一的制度和办法，而只能规定一些执行政策的原则和简便易行的办法。在一九五四到一九五五年度的农村粮食统购统销工作中，各地经过上一年度的实践，已经摸出了一些经验，定出了一些具体办法，但在全国范围来说，这些经验毕竟还不成熟；加以去年相当大的地区遭受了严重的水灾，对于正常情况下全国粮食的生产和需要、农民余粮和缺粮的全面情况仍然没有彻底摸清，仍然不可能定出一套切合全国实际情况的统一的制度和办法。这就是说，在过去两年的粮食统购统销工作中，我们主要地是依靠充分的政治工作，依靠全党的努力，采取上级颁发控制数字、发动群众民主评议的办法，来完成国家的粮食统购统销任务。事实证明，过去这样做是完全必要和完全正确的。正是由于采取了这样的做法，过去两年的粮食统购统销任务才得以胜利完成，国家才能及时地掌握粮源，基本上消灭了粮食投机，稳定了市场，保证了城市、工矿区人民和农村缺粮人民的需要，保证了技术作物区的农民、灾区人民和渔民、盐民、牧民、船民等的需要，保证了国家建设和国防的需要，特别是保证了平稳地渡过去年严重的灾荒。这些巨大的成绩是必须肯定的。
    两年来的实践证明，粮食统购统销政策必须坚持，但粮食统购统销的办法必须在总结已有经验的基础上逐渐改进，使之更加完备。过去粮食统购统销工作中的主要困难和缺点，就在于缺乏一套必要的具体制度和办法，使粮食工作有切实的依据；各地的粮食统购统销工作，还没有在划清农民余粮缺粮界限的基础上，同时安排，结合进行；结果就产生了某些不合理的现象。在粮食统购方面，我们向农民统购的粮食，加上征粮部分，虽不及全国粮食产量的三分之一，但在有些地方，任务分配得不够合理，以致有的农民应该出售的余粮没有售足，有的农民出售的粮食则超过了余粮的界限。在农村粮食统销方面，对有些应该供应的农民供应不足，而对许多不该供应的却供应了，对一些应该迟供应的却提前供应了。农民是个体的小生产者，他们一方面看到粮食统购统销的好处而热情地拥护这个政策，但另一方面他们又习惯于形式上自由处理自己的余粮，而不习惯于国家的粮食统购统销办法。加以每年购销数字农民不能预先知道，因此某些农民就很自然地产生了“购销无底”、“增产无益”的错觉。这是今年三、四月间一度出现的农村粮食供应紧张的重要原因之一。因此，采取有效措施切实改进粮食统购统销工作，巩固工农联盟，发展农业生产，就成为当前的一个迫切的问题。
    今年三月中共中央和国务院曾发出指示，要求各地在春耕前后把国家今年征收和统购的粮食数字宣布到乡，并决定在农村的粮食统购统销工作中实行“定产、定购、定销”的办法。这个“三定”办法的宣布大大地提高了广大农民的生产积极性。但是，由于当时即将进入农忙季节，一时来不及把“三定”数字具体确定到每一个农户，因此，有些农民仍然觉得“不摸底”，某些顾虑仍然没有完全解除。
    现在，国务院发布的“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”，具体地解决了“三定”到户的问题；并规定了“定产、定购”三年不变、“定销”每年一评的办法。农村粮食统购统销工作的这个新的发展，必将促使农业生产更加发展，工农联盟更加巩固。这个办法充分表现我们的国家对于农民生产积极性的鼓励和积极发展农业生产的精神。在“定产”方面，规定按农民实际种植粮食的单位面积产量来评定，不许高估产量；在评定产量之后，自一九五五年起，在正常年景下三年不变；新垦荒地从收获之年起，三年不计产量。在“定购”方面，规定按农民实际需要扣除用粮数量，对农民的余粮实行合理的单一比例计购，而不实行累进计购；统购粮食一般占农民的余粮的百分之八十到九十，并且确定今年核定到户的统购任务三年不变，增产不增购，灾歉则减免。在“定销”方面，规定按照缺粮农民的粮食生产情况及对粮食的实际需要，每年评定一次，国家切实保证供应；根据何时缺粮何时供应的原则，分别评定各户开始供应的时间和分月供应的计划，由国家粮食机关统一发给供应证，“凭证、按月、定点、定量”进行供应。这样，缺粮农民每年能够提前知道国家要供应自己多少粮食，什么时候开始供应，一方面能安心进行生产，一方面能更好地安排自己全年的用粮计划。
    为了鼓励缺粮农民勤劳生产，办法中还规定所有粮田每年实际产量超过常年产量和增产指标的时候，国家并不扣减供应粮食的数量；对于按照国家计划种植技术作物的缺粮户，国家也给予适当的照顾，不仅规定他们的口粮和饲料的用粮标准不低于当地余粮户的用粮标准；并且规定他们种植粮食的田地，只计算常年产量，三年内不计算增产指标。所有“定产、定购、定销”的原则和粮食征收、统购、统销的数字，今年内都要具体地贯彻到每一个农户。这样，农民们可以留出一定数量的余粮，从容地安排他们发展农业、副业生产的计划和家庭生活计划，增产越多，归农民自己支配的余粮也越多。这样，广大农民就必然更加积极地发展生产，并自觉地出卖余粮给国家，支援社会主义工业化的伟大事业。
    “农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”的实行是农村粮食统购统销工作的新发展。从此，在农村的粮食统购统销工作中，就可以采取购销结合、划分余粮缺粮界限、统一安排、凭证管理的办法，作到应购的购，应销的销，购销多少，同时安排，然后分别发给凭证，使余粮农民无顾虑地处理自己完成统购任务以后剩余的粮食，使缺粮农民所需要的粮食能及时得到供应。有了这种比较完备的办法，农村粮食统购统销的工作分量将会逐渐减轻，使各级党委和政府可以用较少的力量和较短的时间更好地完成粮食工作任务，可以有更多的力量和时间去加强和推进农业合作运动和农业增产运动。由此可见，“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”的制定和实施，不仅对于改进粮食工作本身，而且对于发展整个农村工作都有巨大的意义。
    现在，有些省份正在进行粮食“三定”到户的工作，其他各省也正在准备开展这个工作。各地应该大张旗鼓地向广大农民宣传“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”，使“三定”政策的精神家喻户晓，深入人心。在今后的粮食统购统销工作中，所有农村工作人员都必须认真按照这个办法行事，切实改善农村粮食统购统销工作，巩固工农联盟，保证五年计划胜利实现。
