Congratulatory Message from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions

At the Second National Congress of the Chinese Coal Miners' Union, Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a congratulatory message on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. The full text is as follows:

Comrade representatives:

I extend warm congratulations to the Second National Congress of the Chinese Coal Miners' Union on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

In the past few years, coal mine workers across the country have made glorious contributions to the restoration and development of the national economy with their heroic labor, ensuring the needs of industrial production, transportation, and urban residents for fuel.

In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party, the work of the coal mine union has also made great progress. It has united and educated the broad masses of coal mine workers, actively participated in various political movements such as the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and launched labor emulation drives, giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of coal mine workers. The coal mine union has also done a lot of work in learning and promoting new coal mining methods, promoting mechanization, and improving working conditions.

With the restoration and development of the coal industry and the increase in labor productivity, the material and cultural life of coal mine workers has also been significantly improved.

Our country has promulgated the first Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy. This plan is a program of decisive significance for our people to strive to realize the general task of the transition period. The realization of this plan will lay a good preliminary foundation for our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation.

This congress is being held after the announcement of the country's first Five-Year Plan. I believe that the congress will seriously discuss how to better organize and mobilize coal mine workers across the country to strive to fulfill the tasks of coal industrial production and capital construction in the Five-Year Plan.

The country's first Five-Year Plan gives the coal industry a glorious and arduous task. During the five years, the designed capacity of coal mine enterprises under construction (including the original production capacity) with an annual output of more than one million tons will be thirty-one. By 1957, the national coal output will reach 113 million tons, an increase of 0.8 times compared to the 63.53 million tons in 1952.

Coal is the food of industry and is a pioneering industry. Many new and large-scale factories, power stations, and railways will be built in our country, and they all need the coal industry to supply sufficient and high-quality industrial food. Obviously, in the great socialist construction, the coal industry occupies an extremely important position. Chinese coal mine workers stand on a glorious position and shoulder a very important responsibility.

The coal industry has successfully completed the tasks of the first two years of the Five-Year Plan, but the tasks of the next three years are still very arduous and require us to continue to work hard and overcome difficulties to strive to complete them ahead of schedule and exceed the quota.

The Five-Year Plan points out that 70 percent of the production tasks stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan will be completed by existing enterprises. The production tasks of the coal industry also mainly rely on existing mines. Therefore, in the future, according to the national plan, we must continue to implement comprehensive production reform, give full play to the production potential of existing mines, and make full use of existing mineral resources. At the same time, we should speed up the pace of capital construction, ensure the quality of construction, reduce construction costs, and build many new mines well and quickly to meet the needs of the development of industry and transportation for fuel.

We must mobilize and organize the masses to continuously push the labor emulation drive to a new high, overcome formalism in the labor emulation drive, and strengthen the organizational work of the labor emulation drive—clearly put forward the conditions for the emulation, organize the masses to formulate guarantee conditions for the emulation, and create good conditions for the masses to realize the guarantee conditions. In the labor emulation drive, we must continue to implement the policy of improving technology, enhancing technology, and learning and mastering new technologies, especially focusing on studying Soviet experience, promoting advanced experience, and rationalization proposals. Because turning Soviet experience and our own effective advanced experience into working methods that all employees can master can exert tremendous power, which is a fundamental requirement of the labor emulation drive. The formalism in our labor emulation drive is to ignore or forget this point.

In the labor emulation drive, we must also always pay attention to improving the awareness of the masses of employees and consolidating labor discipline.

The cause of socialist construction requires us to constantly improve our technical level. The state has already and will continue to equip the coal industry with a large number of new technical equipment to greatly reduce the heavy labor of coal industrial production. However, if we do not improve our technology, we will not be able to skillfully master modern machines such as combined coal miners, coal cutting machines, and coal loading machines, and we will not be able to give full play to mechanical efficiency and improve labor productivity. Therefore, we must take learning technology and improving technology as an important task. We must learn from the advanced experience and advanced technology of the Soviet Union, and learn from the advanced experience and advanced technology of fraternal factories and mines.

To learn technology, we must also learn culture and improve our cultural level. The trade union should closely cooperate with the enterprise administration and education departments to create good conditions for employees to learn culture and learn technology.

Trade union organizations must improve their leadership style, give full play to democracy, enthusiastically care about the working conditions and material and cultural life of the masses, and maintain close ties with the masses. We must establish a style of hard work, simplicity, diligence, going deep into the lower levels, and maintaining contact with the masses. We must regularly carry out criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism, to expose and overcome shortcomings in our work and bureaucratic phenomena.

Only by maintaining close ties with the masses can trade union organizations, under the leadership of the Party, better play their supervisory role in enterprises and help state economic organs more effectively overcome bureaucracy and violations of laws and disciplines, corruption, theft, and other phenomena that harm the interests of the state and the working class.

In socialist construction, we must always heighten our revolutionary vigilance. We must educate all employees to draw profound lessons from the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group incident and the sabotage incidents that have occurred in coal mining enterprises, overcome complacency, thoroughly expose and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and defend our socialist construction cause.

This congress will formulate specific tasks for Chinese coal mine workers to strive to achieve the various indicators of the coal industry in the country's first Five-Year Plan, and will elect a new leading body of the coal mine union—the National Committee. On behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, I wish the congress a complete success and wish the representatives good health!

　　中华全国总工会的祝词
    在中国煤矿工会第二届全国代表大会上，中华全国总工会主席赖若愚代表中华全国总工会致祝词。全文如下：各位代表同志们：
    我代表中华全国总工会向中国煤矿工会第二届全国代表大会致热烈的祝贺。
    过去几年，全国煤矿职工以自己英勇的劳动，为国家经济的恢复与发展做出了光荣的贡献，保证了工业生产、交通运输及城市居民对于燃料的需要。
    几年来，在党的领导下，煤矿工会的工作也有了很大的进步。它团结教育了广大的煤矿职工，积极参加了“三反”“五反”、镇压反革命等各项政治运动，开展了劳动竞赛，发挥了煤矿职工的积极性、创造性。在学习、推广新采煤方法，推行机械化，改善劳动条件等方面，煤矿工会也做了许多工作。
    随着煤炭工业的恢复、发展和劳动生产率的提高，煤矿职工的物质生活和文化生活也有了显著的改善。
    我们国家已经公布了发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。这个计划是我国人民为实现过渡时期总任务而奋斗的带有决定意义的纲领，这个计划的实现将为我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业奠定一个良好的初步基础。
    这次代表大会正是在国家第一个五年计划公布之后召开的。我相信，大会将要认真地讨论如何更好地组织动员全国煤矿职工，为实现五年计划中关于煤炭工业生产与基本建设的任务而奋斗。
    在国家的第一个五年计划中给予了煤炭工业以光荣而艰巨的任务。五年内进行建设的煤矿企业，设计能力（包括原有的生产能力在内）在年产一百万吨以上的就有三十一个，到一九五七年全国煤产量将达到一亿一千三百万吨，比一九五二年的六千三百五十三万吨，将增长零点八倍。
    煤炭是工业的食粮，是先行工业。许多新的、规模巨大的工厂、电站、铁路，将在我国建设起来，它们都需要煤炭工业供给充足的、质量良好的工业食粮。很显然，在伟大的社会主义建设中，煤炭工业占有极为重要的地位。中国煤矿职工站在一个光荣的岗位上，担负着十分重要的责任。
    煤炭工业已胜利地完成了五年计划前两年的任务，而后三年的任务还是很艰巨的，需要我们继续努力，克服困难，来争取提前和超额完成。
    五年计划指出，第一个五年计划所规定的生产任务中，有百分之七十要依靠现有企业来完成。煤炭工业的生产任务，也主要是依靠现有矿井来完成。所以今后要根据国家计划，继续贯彻全面生产改革，充分发挥现有矿井的生产潜力，充分利用现有的矿山资源。同时，应该加快基本建设的速度，保证建筑质量，降低建筑成本，把许多新矿井又好又快地建设起来，以适应工业、运输业发展对于燃料的需要。
    必须动员与组织群众，不断地把劳动竞赛推向新的高涨，克服劳动竞赛中的形式主义，加强劳动竞赛的组织工作——明确提出竞赛条件，组织群众制定竞赛保证条件，为群众实现保证条件创造良好条件。在劳动竞赛中，必须继续贯彻改进技术、提高技术、学习与掌握新技术的方针，特别要抓紧学习苏联经验、推广先进经验和合理化建议的工作。因为把苏联的经验和我们自己行之有效的先进经验变成全体职工都能掌握的工作方法，这才能发挥出巨大的力量，这正是劳动竞赛的一个根本要求。我们劳动竞赛中的形式主义，就是忽视或者忘记了这
  一点。
    在劳动竞赛中，还要经常注意提高职工群众的觉悟程度，巩固劳动纪律。
    社会主义的建设事业要求我们不断地提高技术水平。国家已经并且还在继续为煤矿工业装配大量的新的技术设备，使煤矿工业生产的繁重劳动大大减轻。可是，如果我们不提高技术，就不能熟练地掌握联合采煤机、割煤机、装煤机等现代化机器，就不能充分发挥机械效能、提高劳动生产率。所以，我们必须把学习技术、提高技术，作为重要的任务。要学习苏联的先进经验、先进技术，学习各兄弟厂矿的先进经验、先进技术。
    要学习技术，还必须学习文化，提高文化水平。工会应该和企业行政方面、教育部门密切配合，为职工学习文化和学习技术，创造良好的条件。
    工会组织必须改进领导作风，充分发扬民主，热情地关心群众的劳动条件和物质、文化生活，密切联系群众。要树立艰苦朴素、勤勤恳恳、深入下层、联系群众的作风。要经常地开展批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评，揭露与克服工作中的缺点和官僚主义现象。
    工会组织只有与群众保持密切联系，才能在党的领导下更好地发挥它在企业中的监督作用，帮助国家经济机关更有效地克服官僚主义和违法乱纪、贪污盗窃等损害国家利益和工人阶级利益的现象。
    在社会主义建设中，要时刻提高革命警惕。要教育全体职工从胡风反革命集团的事件，以及煤矿企业中发生的破坏事件中取得深刻的教训，克服麻痹思想，彻底揭露与消灭一切暗藏的反革命分子，保卫我们的社会主义建设事业。
    这次大会将为中国煤矿职工制定出为实现国家第一个五年计划中关于煤炭工业的各项指标而奋斗的具体任务，将选举出煤矿工会新的领导机构——全国委员会。我谨代表中华全国总工会预祝大会的胜利成功，并祝代表们身体健康！
