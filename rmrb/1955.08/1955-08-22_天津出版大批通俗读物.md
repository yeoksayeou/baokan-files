　　Tianjin Popular Publishing House published the short story collection "Support New Factories" by worker-writer Da Lu at the end of July. This is the fifth collection of the "Tianjin Worker Literary Creation Selection" published by Tianjin Popular Publishing House. Prior to this, Tianjin Popular Publishing House also published creative collections by Tianjin railway worker Zheng Gufan, worker-writer A Feng, and others. Since its establishment in 1952, this publishing house has published nearly two hundred kinds of popular readings, with a circulation of more than five million copies, including literary creations, natural science, and current affairs and political readings.
　　Tianjin Popular Publishing House maintains contact with bookstores, cultural centers, factories, and government offices, and frequently learns about the needs and opinions of readers. In the first half of this year, according to the demands of the workers, the publishing house published a selection of one-act plays "Safe" and the allegro "Wipe Them Out in One Sweep," which depicts the heroic struggle against the enemy by the people on the coastal defense front. These performance materials are suitable for performances in factories. In order to resist pornographic publications, the publishing house also published more than 250,000 copies of literary creations, folk tales, translated novels, etc. The Soviet anti-espionage thriller "Deep Snow" was published in July this year, and it was printed for the second time in the same month, with a circulation of more than 35,000 copies. Recently, the publishing house also published two collections of "The Heinous Activities of the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique in Tianjin." "Criticism of the Hu Feng Group's Reactionary Ideology," which is currently being edited, will also be published soon. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　天津出版大批通俗读物
    天津通俗出版社在七月底出版了工人作家大吕的短篇小说选“支援新厂”，这是天津通俗出版社出版的“天津工人文艺创作选集”的第五集。在这以前，天津通俗出版社还出版了天津的铁路工人郑固藩、工人作家阿凤等人的创作选集。从一九五二年成立以来，这个出版社已经出版了近二百种通俗读物，发行了五百多万册，有文艺创作、自然科学和时事政治读物。
    天津通俗出版社和书店、文化馆、工厂、机关都保持着联系，经常了解读者的需要和意见。今年上半年，这个出版社根据工人们的要求，出版了独幕剧选“保险箱”、描写海防前线人民英勇对敌斗争的快板“一网打尽”等，这些演唱材料都适宜在工厂里演出。为了抵制黄色书刊，这个出版社还出版了文艺创作、民间故事、翻译小说等共二十五万多册。苏联反间谍惊险小说“深雪”在今年七月份出版后，当月就印了第二次，发行三万五千多册。最近，出版社还出版了两集“胡风反革命集团在天津的罪恶活动”。正在编辑中的“胡风集团反动思想批判”也即将出版。　（新华社）
