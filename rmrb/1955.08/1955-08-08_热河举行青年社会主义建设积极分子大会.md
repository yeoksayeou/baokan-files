    The Hotan Province Youth Socialist Construction Activists Congress was held in Chengde City from the 1st to the 6th. Three hundred and eight youth activists selected from various work posts attended the congress.

    Guo Hongde, Director of the Organization Department of the CPC Hotan Provincial Committee, delivered a report at the congress on behalf of the Provincial Committee entitled "Unite, Educate, and Lead the Youth of the Province to Strive for the Completion of the First Five-Year Plan." He put forward four requirements to the youth activists: further exert enthusiasm for building the motherland and be glorious laborers; enhance revolutionary vigilance, eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and resolutely struggle against acts that harm the interests of the country and the people; diligently study political, cultural, and scientific knowledge, and constantly improve communist consciousness and the ability to build the motherland; be modest and prudent, and avoid boasting and arrogance.

　　At the meeting, Wei Yong'an, captain of the Second Youth Rapid Tunneling Team of Beipiao Mine, who comprehensively completed the national plan every month for three years and four months, Zhang Suzhen, director of Chunsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative, who actively led farmers to take the road of collectivization, and Xu Mengzhi, a sales clerk who enthusiastically served customers, and 25 others spoke successively, introducing their advanced deeds and experiences.

　　During the meeting, nineteen youth activists, including Deng Shuqing and Li Qinghuan, graduates of senior primary schools and junior middle schools who participated in agricultural production, jointly wrote a letter to tens of thousands of middle and primary school students in the province who returned to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production. They suggested that while participating in agricultural production, everyone should spread the culture they have learned in the countryside, and strive to eliminate illiteracy for ten people each in the next three years, creating favorable conditions for the completion and overfulfillment of the country's first five-year plan.

　　The youth activists who attended the congress unanimously expressed their willingness to strive to realize the resolutions of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress. Li Jiping, a telephone operator from the Chengde City Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, and Wang Ruizhu, a production committee member of the Wusan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chifeng County, youth activists who attended the conference, respectively launched a friendship competition to young workers and farmers across the province on behalf of the youth activists on the industrial front and their own cooperatives. They also announced at the meeting their guaranteed conditions for overfulfilling the five-year plan.
