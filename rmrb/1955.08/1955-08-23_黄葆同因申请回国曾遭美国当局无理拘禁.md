Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd: This reporter reports: Chinese student Huang Baotong recounted to this reporter his experience of being detained by U.S. immigration authorities for 116 days for applying to return to China. Huang Baotong had applied to return to China four years ago, but only returned to the motherland three months ago.

Huang Baotong said that on May 25, 1951—the second day he started processing his return to China, the U.S. immigration authorities arrested him under the pretext that his residence permit had expired. Although Huang Baotong repeatedly stated that he had applied for an extension a month before his residence permit expired, immigration officials ignored his explanation and sent him to a detention center on Ellis Island, outside New York, and did not even allow bail for temporary release.

During an interrogation a week later, Huang Baotong requested to return to China voluntarily. The immigration judge told him that in order to return to China, he must first have sufficient travel expenses to ensure immediate departure from the United States, and must also prove that he had good conduct during his stay in the United States. Huang Baotong immediately assured the judge that he could quickly raise enough travel expenses, and provided letters from professors at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute proving his good conduct.

Despite the fact that Huang Baotong met the conditions required by the immigration judge, he was still not approved to return to China. Instead, he was detained on Ellis Island under the guise of being deported.

It wasn't until September 17, 1951, after being detained for 116 days, that the Immigration Bureau allowed him to be temporarily released on bail of $2,000, subject to various restrictions. These restrictions included: reporting in person to the local immigration office every Monday, not leaving the area under the jurisdiction of the New York Immigration Bureau, and not participating in various gatherings, etc.

After leaving the detention center, Huang Baotong still did not enjoy freedom. In August 1952, he graduated from Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute and found a job at Princeton University, not far from New York. However, the Immigration Bureau did not allow him to go to Princeton, which was not within the jurisdiction of the New York Immigration Bureau. After repeated requests, the Immigration Bureau agreed that Huang Baotong could go to Princeton to work every day, but could not live there.

Huang Baotong had to move to Blawenburg, New Jersey, on the border of the New York Immigration Bureau's jurisdiction, and commute between this small town and Princeton every day. In addition, he had to travel eighty miles to the Newark Immigration Sub-bureau every Monday to report.

Huang Baotong said that the physical and mental suffering caused by this extremely unstable life during the two and a half years since then was immeasurable, not to mention the loss of time and money.

During this period, Huang Baotong repeatedly reapplied to return to China, but received no response. It was only in the summer of 1954 that he received a letter from the Immigration Bureau stating that if he insisted on applying, he would be sentenced to a fine of up to $1,000 or one year in prison, or both.

In October 1954, Huang Baotong received a notice from the Immigration Bureau allowing him to leave the country. After that, due to delays in various procedures, he was unable to travel until April 1955. Before leaving, Huang Baotong received an order from the Immigration Bureau: to deport him.

Huang Baotong also told the reporter that a professor at Princeton University told him before he left that the FBI had been sending agents to the school to secretly investigate his activities for more than two years. Huang Baotong said that this shows that the U.S. authorities have very strict control over Chinese students who want to return to China.

Huang Baotong went to the United States in August 1947. He obtained a doctorate in chemistry from Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in New York City. He left the United States on April 10 this year, arrived in Guangzhou on May 3, and arrived in Beijing on June 12. He is now preparing to participate in the construction of the motherland.

　　黄葆同因申请回国曾遭美国当局无理拘禁
    新华社二十二日讯　本社记者报道：中国留学生黄葆同向本社记者叙述了他因申请回国而被美国移民当局拘禁了一百十六天的经过。黄葆同在四年以前就已经申请回国，但是直到三个月以前才回到祖国来。
    黄葆同说，一九五一年五月二十五日——他开始办理回国手续的第二天，美国移民当局就以居留证过期为借口把他逮捕了。黄葆同虽然再三声明他早在居留证期满前一个月就已申请延长，移民局人员仍然不顾他的解释而把他送到纽约口外艾利斯岛上的拘禁所去监禁起来，连交保暂释也不准。
    在一个星期以后的一次审讯上，黄葆同要求自动回国。移民局的法官对他说，要想回国必须首先有足够的旅费以保证能立即离开美国，并且还要证明本人在留美期间的品行良好。黄葆同当场向法官保证他可以很快筹得足够的旅费，同时拿出了布鲁克林理工学院的教授证明他一向品行良好的信件。
    尽管黄葆同具备了移民局法官要求的条件，他仍旧没有被批准回国，相反地却在被判驱逐出境的名义下继续被拘留在艾利斯岛上。
    直到一九五一年九月十七日，他被拘禁一百十六天之后，移民局才准许他在遵守各种限制的条件下交两千美元保证金暂时出狱。这些限制包括：每星期一亲自向住地移民局报告一次，不得离开纽约移民局所管辖的区域和不得参加各种集会等等。
    在离开拘禁所以后，黄葆同仍然享受不到自由。一九五二年八月，他从布鲁克林理工学院毕业并且在离纽约不远的普林斯顿大学找到了一个工作。但是，移民局不允许他到不在纽约移民局的辖区以内的普林斯顿去。经过三番五次的请求，移民局才答应黄葆同可以每天到普林斯顿去工作，但不得在那里居住。
    黄葆同只得搬到在纽约移民局辖区边界上的新泽西州布拉温伯格镇去住，每天在这个小镇和普林斯顿之间往返奔波。此外每星期一还要来回跋涉八十英里到纽瓦克的移民分局去报告。
    从那时起的两年半中，黄葆同说，由于这种极不安定的生活而造成的身体和精神上的痛苦是无法估量的，且不说时间和金钱上的损失了。
    这期间，黄葆同曾多次重新申请回国，都没有得到答复。只是在一九五四年夏天他才接到移民局的一封信，说假如他还要坚持申请的话，就要被判以高达一千美元或一年徒刑的处分，或者同时受到这两种处罚。
    到了一九五四年十月，黄葆同接到移民局的通知允许他离境。此后，因为种种手续的拖延，直到一九五五年四月才得以成行。而在临走以前，黄葆同又接到了移民局的命令：把他驱逐出境。
    黄葆同还向记者谈起，普林斯顿大学有一个教授曾在他动身以前告诉他，两年多来美国联邦调查局不断派特务到学校来暗中侦察他的活动。黄葆同说，由此可见美国当局对想回国的中国留学生的控制是很严的。
    黄葆同是一九四七年八月到美国去的。他曾在纽约市布鲁克林理工学院获得化学博士学位。他在今年四月十日离开美国，五月三日到广州，六月十二日到达北京。他现在准备参加祖国的建设事业。
