According to the state plan, this year's national grain production task is 360.8 billion jin, an increase of 21.8 billion jin over last year's actual output; the cotton production task is 26.0666 million dan, an increase of 4.7 million dan over last year. Striving to fulfill and overfulfill this major task is of extremely great significance for completing the agricultural development plan in my country's first five-year plan. Judging from the current situation, it is possible to complete this task if there are no unexpected disasters. This year's early rice, except for some areas in South China where production was slightly reduced due to drought, has achieved a bumper harvest in most areas; the middle rice is currently in the round-stem and booting stage, growing vigorously; the late rice has begun to tiller and is growing well. Early autumn crops such as spring corn, sorghum, millet, and sweet potatoes in the north are growing strongly; cotton is generally growing well, and a bumper harvest is expected in most areas.

To strive for this year's bumper harvest, the broad masses of farmers have made tremendous efforts under the leadership of the Party and the government. This spring, all regions thoroughly implemented the "State Council's Resolution on Spring Plowing Production" and the "Three Fixes" policy for grain; the existing agricultural production cooperatives were universally consolidated; a large amount of agricultural tools, fertilizers, and other means of production needed by farmers were supplied; a large number of agricultural loans were issued, and technical extension organizations were widely established, and technical personnel were trained; for some disaster areas and areas with spring famine, grain was transferred and relief work was carried out in a timely manner. These effective measures greatly encouraged the farmers' enthusiasm for production and ensured the over-fulfillment of the national grain and cotton sowing plans. It is estimated that this year's high-yield crops such as potatoes and corn will increase by about 26 million mu; the area of single-season rice converted to double-season, intercropping converted to continuous cropping, and indica rice converted to japonica rice in the southern rice areas is estimated to be more than 9 million mu larger than last year; the cotton sowing area exceeds the plan by more than one million mu. The implementation of various production increase measures has ensured the production of more grain and cotton than last year.

The natural conditions this year are generally better than last year. Since the beginning of spring, varying degrees of drought have occurred in coastal areas of South China and in some areas of Shandong, Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei, and Shanxi provinces. Although winter wheat production in Shandong and Shaanxi provinces was reduced due to drought, and spring and summer sowing in some areas were forced to be postponed, and seedling growth was poor, most areas, thanks to the large-scale drought prevention and resistance struggle by the broad masses of farmers, and the subsequent rainfall in the summer, have basically lifted the drought situation, except for northern Shaanxi, northern Shanxi, and parts of Rehe. The growth of major autumn crops has returned to normal. Last winter and this spring, the dikes of major rivers across the country were raised and reinforced. In addition, the rainy season arrived later this year, and the rainfall was relatively dispersed. As of early August, the area affected by mountain floods and waterlogging is estimated to be no more than one-twelfth of the area affected last year. At the same time, due to the low water level of rivers and lakes, drainage was rapid, and some flooded seedlings were rescued in time, and replanting and conversion were carried out, which has reduced the affected area to a minimum.

There is still some time before the autumn harvest season, and the threat of various natural disasters to agricultural production still exists seriously. We must be fully prepared, have high confidence, and overcome the frequently occurring autumn floods in the north, autumn droughts in the south, and various pests. The Yellow River and Huai River basins have just entered the flood season, and we must be vigilant at all times, make preparations for flood prevention and waterlogging, and rescue seedlings in time to reduce losses. It should be recognized that an expected bumper harvest does not mean that a bumper harvest has already been achieved. To ensure a bumper harvest, we must continue to work hard, not only should we fully consolidate the existing achievements, but also make full use of the current favorable natural conditions to strive for further increases in production. Areas that have already achieved a bumper harvest in summer should strive for a continuous bumper harvest in autumn; areas that are expected to complete the annual plan should strive to overfulfill the plan; areas where it is estimated that it is still difficult to complete the plan should resolutely overcome difficulties and strive to complete the plan. Only in this way can we overfulfill the annual agricultural production increase plan nationwide.

The experience of the agricultural production increase campaign that was universally launched in various regions last autumn proves that strengthening the late-stage field management of major autumn crops has a huge effect on increasing production and ensuring harvests. This year, many regions have increased the planting area of high-yield crops such as rice, corn, and potatoes, and further promoted the cultivation system of rational intercropping and inter-row cropping, and the late autumn harvest area has been expanded compared with previous years. The growing time of some crops whose sowing period was delayed due to drought will be longer. This all shows that late-stage field management must continue to be strengthened. In single-season late rice areas, we should continue to promote the advanced experience of shallow irrigation and sunning the fields, and applying topdressing fertilizer at the appropriate time, and also carefully prevent and control rice blast and rice stem borers, and strictly prevent autumn floods and waterlogging. In double-cropping rice areas, we should ensure that we harvest, plow the rice stubble, and replant seedlings, and should also cultivate and topdress in a timely manner, and do a good job in drought prevention and pest control. In miscellaneous grain crop areas, we should carry out cultivation, weeding, soil cultivation, pruning bottom leaves, and topdressing at the appropriate time according to the characteristics of various crops, and pay attention to preventing frost damage. Summer-sown crops are in the growing season, so we should cultivate and weed them in a timely manner to achieve clean soil and loose soil, so as to drain water and resist drought. The base fertilizer for summer-sown crops this year is generally insufficient, so we should seize the time to supplement the fertilizer and topdress. Artificial pollination is an effective way to increase the yield of late corn at this stage, and all regions should also seize the time to carry it out. For summer-planted sweet potatoes, we should do a good job in cultivation, weeding, and soil cultivation, and should also remove the hairy roots to reduce nutrient consumption. Pests such as locusts, armyworms, corn borers, and sorghum aphids must be prevented and controlled in a timely manner. For cotton, we must strengthen late-stage pruning and pest and disease control. If there is excessive autumn rain, we should appropriately implement drainage, cultivation, and sunning the land. Regions with appropriate conditions can promote the advanced technology of foliar spraying of phosphate fertilizer, and prevent late-stage excessive growth and late maturity of cotton plants. Regions with appropriate conditions should also sow late autumn crops to increase the late-season harvest. All these technical measures must be adapted to local conditions, respect the local farmers' production experience and habits, first learn from the farmers, and then summarize advanced experience and promote it, so as to achieve twice the result with half the effort. All regions must resolutely prevent subjective impatience, coercive orders, and a style of work that is divorced from reality and the masses.

When harvesting grain, implementing careful harvesting and threshing to ensure that every grain returns home; when harvesting cotton, achieving careful harvesting and clean picking, is also an effective way to increase the yield of grain and cotton. Last year, many regions used the method of carefully accounting, checking losses, and comparing income to conduct in-depth education on careful harvesting and threshing among farmers, and achieved considerable results and experience. Last year, during the rice harvest, cadres in many areas of Sichuan Province went deep into the countryside to guide the masses to improve rice threshing technology, and the province's more than 50 million mu of middle rice yielded an estimated increase of more than 250 million jin of rice. This year, all regions should make early preparations for the autumn harvest, carry forward the existing experience, and combine it with the promotion of grain conservation, educate farmers to recognize the principle of accumulating small amounts to make large amounts, link the harvest of each household, each group, and each cooperative with the state's production increase plan, study and promote scientific harvesting methods, and strive for a greater bumper harvest.

Speaking of the national situation, the wheat harvest this year is generally good, and an autumn bumper harvest is also in sight. As a result, some rural workers and farmers have developed a sense of satisfaction and slackness, which is very dangerous. It should be recognized that autumn is a season prone to natural disasters, and whether natural disasters can be effectively prevented and overcome in a timely manner has a decisive impact on agricultural harvests. Disaster prevention preparation, field management, and careful harvesting and threshing are all very detailed and concrete organizational work and material preparation work, and it is impossible to obtain practical results without specific guidance and effective efforts. All rural workers must deeply recognize the importance of the current agricultural season, thoroughly overcome the idea of "taking a break," strengthen specific leadership, take the 650,000 agricultural cooperatives as the core, and drive the broad masses of mutual aid groups and individual farmers to make persistent efforts, overcome all natural disasters, and strive to complete and overfulfill the 1955 agricultural production increase plan!

    再接再厉，争取完成今年农业增产计划
    根据国家计划，今年全国粮食生产任务为三千六百零八亿斤，比去年实际产量增加二百一十八亿斤；棉花生产任务为二千六百零六万六千担，比去年增加四百七十万担。争取完成和超额完成这一重大任务，对于完成我国第一个五年计划中的农业发展计划具有极为重大的意义。按照目前情况看来，如无意外灾害，完成这一任务是可能的。今年的早稻除华南部分地区因旱略为减产以外，多数地区已获丰收；中稻正圆秆孕穗，生长旺盛；晚稻开始分蘖，生长良好。北方的春玉米、高粱、谷子、甘薯等早秋作物生长茁壮；棉花生长一般良好，绝大部分地区丰收在望。
    为了争取今年的丰收，广大农民在党和政府领导下，做了巨大的努力。今年春季，各地深入贯彻了“国务院关于春耕生产的决议”和粮食“三定”政策；对已有的农业生产合作社普遍地进行了整顿巩固工作；大量供应农民所需要的农具、肥料等生产资料；发放大批农业贷款，并且广泛地建立技术推广组织和进行了技术人员的训练；对部分灾区和发生春荒地区，及时进行粮食的调运和救济工作。这些有效的措施，大大鼓舞了农民的生产积极性，保证了全国粮棉作物播种计划的超额完成。今年的薯类、玉米等高产作物估计比去年增加二千六百万亩左右；南方水稻地区单季改双季、间作改连作、籼稻改粳稻的改种面积，估计比去年扩大九百余万亩；棉花播种面积超过计划百万亩以上。各项增产措施的实行，保证了比去年增产更多的粮食和棉花。
    今年的自然条件，一般要比去年为好。入春以来，华南沿海地区和山东、陕西、河南、河北、山西等省部分地区，曾经发生程度不同的干旱现象。虽然山东、陕西两省冬小麦因旱减产，部分地区春播、夏播被迫推迟，幼苗生育较差；但大部地区由于广大农民进行了规模巨大的防旱抗旱斗争，进入夏季又先后落雨，目前除陕西和山西北部及热河部分地区以外，其他地区旱象已基本解除，大秋作物的生长已恢复正常。去冬今春，全国各大河流的堤岸都曾加高加固，加以今年雨季到来较迟，雨量比较分散，截至八月上旬，各地山洪、内涝成灾面积估计不超过去年成灾面积的十二分之一。同时，由于江湖水位较低，排水很快，部分被淹禾苗及时得到抢救，并进行了补种、改种等工作，已使成灾面积减缩到最小的限度。
    现在到秋收季节还有一段时间，各种自然灾害对农业生产的威胁还严重存在。我们必须有充分的准备，高度的信心，战胜经常发生的北方的秋涝、南方的秋旱和各种各样的虫害。黄河和淮河流域刚刚进入汛期，我们必须时刻警惕，做好防汛、防涝的准备，及时抢救禾苗，减少损失。应该认识丰收在望并不等于已经丰收。为了确保丰收，必须继续努力，不仅应该全力巩固现有的成绩，而且要充分运用目前有利的自然条件，争取进一步增加生产。夏季业已获得丰收的地区，要争取秋季连续丰收；估计可以完成全年计划的地区要力争超额完成计划；估计完成计划尚有困难的地区，要坚决克服困难，力争完成计划。只有这样，才能在全国范围内超额完成全年的农业增产计划。
    去年秋季各地普遍开展的农业增产运动的经验证明，加强大秋作物后期田间管理，对增产保收有巨大的作用。今年很多地区增加了水稻、玉米、薯类等高产作物的种植面积，进一步推广了合理间作、套作的栽培制度，晚秋收获面积比往年扩大了。部分因旱推迟播种期的农作物生长时间更要长些。这都说明后期田间管理工作必须继续加强。在单季晚稻地区，应该继续推行浅灌晒田、适期施用追肥的先进经验，并且认真防治稻热病和三化螟，严防秋汛和内涝。在双季稻地区，应该切实作到随收割、随翻稻桩、随补苗，并应适时中耕、追肥，做好防旱、治虫工作。在杂粮作物地区，要根据各种作物的特性，适时进行中耕、除草、培土、打底叶、施追肥，并注意防止霜害。夏播作物正在生育时期，应该及时中耕除草，达到地净土松，以便排水抗旱。今年夏播作物的基肥一般都感不足，应该抓紧时间进行补肥追肥。人工辅助授粉是现阶段提高晚玉米产量的有效办法，各地也要抓紧时间进行。对夏插甘薯，要做好中耕、除草和培土工作，并应剔除毛根，减少养分消耗。对于蝗虫、黏虫、玉米螟、高粱蚜虫等害虫，必须及时防除。对于棉花要加强后期整枝和防治病虫害的工作，如秋雨过多，要适当实行排水、中耕、晒地，有条件地区可推行根外喷施磷肥的先进技术，并防止棉株后期疯长和晚熟现象。具备适当条件的地区，还应该播种晚秋作物，以增加晚季的收获量。所有这些技术措施，必须因地制宜，尊重当地农民生产经验和习惯，先向农民学习，而后总结先进经验，加以推广，这才能收事半功倍之效。各地必须坚决防止主观急躁、强迫命令、脱离实际、脱离群众的作风。
    在收获粮食的时候，实行细收细打，争取颗粒还家；在收获棉花的时候，做到细收净摘，也是增加粮食和棉花收获量的一个有效办法。去年不少地区都运用算细账、查损失、比收入的办法，向农民进行深入的精收细打的教育，获得了不少成绩和经验。去年收获水稻期间，四川省许多地区的干部深入农村指导群众改进打谷技术，全省五千多万亩中稻，约计多收稻谷二亿五千多万斤。今年各地应及早作好秋收准备，发扬已有的经验，结合节约粮食的宣传，教育农民认识积少成多的道理，把一家一户一组一社的收获同国家的增产计划联系起来，研究和推广科学的收割办法，争取更大的丰收。
    就全国的情况来说，今年麦收一般良好，秋季丰收又已在望，部分农村工作人员和农民因此产生了一种满足情绪和松劲思想，这是非常危险的。应该认识，秋季是容易发生自然灾害的季节，能否有效地预防和及时地战胜自然灾害，对农业收成具有决定性的影响。而防灾准备工作，田间管理工作，精收细打工作，都是很细致、很具体的组织工作和物质准备工作，如果不经过具体的指导和有效的努力，就不可能获得实际的效果。所有农村工作人员必须深刻认识目前农事季节的重要性，彻底克服“歇一歇”的思想，加强具体领导，以六十五万个农业合作社为核心，带动广大互助组和个体农民，再接再厉，战胜一切自然灾害，为争取一九五五年农业增产计划的完成和超额完成而奋斗！
