　　Rural Work Teams Must Rely on Party Branches to Carry Out Work
　　Zhang Yiqiao Gao Hua
    Recently, many provinces such as Jilin, Shanxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang have decided to draw a large number of cadres from leadership organs at all levels to form work teams to go deep into rural areas to rectify agricultural production cooperatives, grain unified purchase and sales, and rectify Party branches. This is a major measure to strengthen rural work.
    The method of leadership organs dispatching work teams to go deep into the grassroots to carry out work is an effective working method that our Party often adopts. This method can enable the Party's leadership organs to directly contact the grassroots masses during a certain period—to promptly understand the emotions and demands of the masses, to promptly publicize and implement the Party's policies to the masses, thereby powerfully completing the current political tasks; and to absorb the experiences created by the broad masses of working people in practical work to enrich the experience of the leadership organs and strengthen the guidance of the current movement. However, work teams must pay attention to one issue when carrying out work, that is, they cannot and should not replace the role of Party branches. Because, Party branches are the Party's grassroots organizations, the Party's fighting fortresses, and all the Party's resolutions and instructions are realized through Party branches uniting and organizing the working people. The members of the Party's grassroots organizations live, produce, and work with the masses and have close ties with them. Therefore, Party branches are most familiar with the emotions and demands of the local working people and can publicize and implement the Party's policies according to the specific situation. In terms of implementing the Party's policies, Party grassroots organizations can also organize Party members to set an example in striving to realize the Party's policies, and the practical actions of Party members set an example for the broad masses to accept the Party's policies, which has a great effect on the implementation of the Party's policies. Therefore, wherever Party branches have already been established, no matter what work is being carried out, it should rely on Party branches. The role of the work team can only be to guide the branch, according to the principles of the Party, to give play to the branch's initiative and enthusiasm, and to complete the work tasks with the collective strength of the branch; at the same time, to help solve the problems in the branch and improve the branch's political level and work level. In places where Party branches have not yet been established, the work team has the responsibility to combine current work, select and cultivate activists, and help the local Party committee develop new Party members and establish Party branches.
    Since the implementation of the Party's general line, Party committees in various places have sent out work teams to focus on trial-running agricultural production cooperatives in rural areas. The work of the past two years has proven that, wherever the work team relies on the branch to run the cooperative and cares about the construction of the Party branch, constantly improving the branch's ability to run the cooperative, the work has achieved great results. Xigou and Chuandi townships in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, initially formed a chaotic situation of "everyone is a superior, everything is the center" because too many staff members were sent by the leadership organs, and they did not take the branch as the main body when carrying out work. Later, the work team corrected this shortcoming, helped the branch adhere to the collective leadership system, and stipulated that all important work must be discussed and decided by the branch committee or the branch general meeting, and unified planning, so the progress of various tasks and the implementation of various policies were relatively smooth, and the branch also gained experience in running the cooperative, and set an example for the branches and masses in nearby townships. However, even today, there are still many work teams that do not rely on Party branches but take over the work of the branch when carrying out work. Some branch members of key townships stationed by work teams in Chagnan County, Shandong Province, reflected that their "tasks are three: one, to send out notices and run errands before the meeting, two, to move benches and fetch water for the meeting, and three, to get statistical figures for the superiors"; and in fact, for some statistical figures, the branch can only find out by asking the work team. Doing so not only failed to give play to and improve the role of the branch, but also caused the branch to gradually lose its combat effectiveness. After the work team leaves, the branch still will not run the cooperative and will not work. This kind of key township will also find it difficult to play the role of promoting and guiding other Party branches in running the cooperative.
    To rely on Party branches to carry out tasks such as rectifying and building cooperatives, it must be combined with Party rectification and Party building. Doing a good job in the construction of Party branches is a guarantee for the smooth completion of various rural tasks such as rectifying and building cooperatives. However, some comrades in the work team believe that rectifying and developing agricultural production cooperatives is contradictory to strengthening the construction of Party branches, and some say: "The task of rectifying and building cooperatives is very heavy, and no more branch construction work can be done." This is a manifestation of not establishing the concept of relying on the branch to run the cooperative. In fact, these comrades have not yet understood how to run the cooperative and how to strengthen the construction of Party branches, and have not yet understood that rectifying and developing agricultural production cooperatives and rectifying and building the Party are two closely related tasks. In the first district of Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, the deputy secretary of the district Party committee participated in the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation conference in the province; the secretary of the district Party committee participated in the Party's organizational work conference in the province. At the beginning of the district Party committee meeting, one said that mutual aid and cooperation were important, and the other said that Party rectification and Party building were important. Later, they analyzed the situation of the agricultural production cooperatives and Party branches in their district and found that the development and consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives were completely consistent with the quality of the Party branches. The facts showed that the two tasks must be combined, so they made unified arrangements for the two tasks. The experiences of various places have proved that: only by relying on Party branches to run the cooperative, and at the same time paying attention to the construction of the branch, can the cooperative be developed and consolidated, and the working level of the branch can be improved; at the same time, a group of outstanding elements with socialist consciousness will be discovered and cultivated, and preparations will be made for developing new Party members. The situations in various places have also proved that: the problems within the cooperative are a reflection of all the problems within the Party. For example, if landlords, rich peasants, and other saboteurs have mixed into some cooperatives, then, either there is also a serious organizational impurity within the Party, or the core leading class viewpoint of this branch is vague, the position is unstable, or the political vigilance is not high; if the implementation of the Party's voluntary and mutually beneficial policies in some cooperatives has deviations, the Party members in this branch must have serious capitalist ideas and behaviors, or have abandoned the leadership of the cooperative; if the mutual aid and cooperation movement in some townships cannot be carried out, it must be because this branch has no experience in running the cooperative, or there are too few Party members to become the core of leading and uniting the masses. Therefore, rectifying and developing agricultural production cooperatives must be combined with rectifying Party branches and developing new Party members. Wherever there are serious impurity problems in the Party branch, these serious impurity problems must be resolved; wherever Party members' class consciousness is not high, political vigilance is not high, and there are shortcomings in their work, they must be educated to raise their awareness and correct their shortcomings; wherever Party branches have no experience in running the cooperative, they must be helped to gain experience in running the cooperative through the work of rectifying and developing the cooperative; wherever there are few Party members in the branch, they must be helped to do a good job in developing new Party members and strengthen the Party's organizational strength. Only in this way can the Party branch have the ability to constantly strengthen the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives, solve various problems within the cooperative at any time, and enable agricultural production cooperatives to be consolidated and developed.
    How should rural work teams rely on the branch and take the branch as the main body to carry out work? We believe that at least the following points should be noted:
    It is necessary to help the branch unify the arrangement of various tasks. When the work team arrives in the countryside, it should be noted that the work team has determined its tasks from the leadership organs, and these tasks must rely on the organizational strength of the branch to be implemented according to the specific conditions of the locality; at the same time, the branch also has regular tasks arranged by the superior departments and problems that occur among the local masses that need to be solved. Therefore, the work team must submit its tasks and requirements to the branch, combine them with the actual situation in the locality, include them in the branch's work plan, and help the branch unify the arrangement of various tasks, so that the branch and the work team have a unified work plan. With a unified work plan, the work team and the branch can have consistent requirements and consistent steps, which is convenient for concentrating efforts to take the branch as the main body to carry out work.
    It is necessary to help the branch carry out work in accordance with the principle of the Party's collective leadership; all major tasks must be discussed and decided by the branch committee or the branch general meeting. Therefore, the work team itself must first strictly implement the principle of collective leadership and respect the powers of the branch committee or the branch general meeting. When dealing with various problems in the work, the responsibility of the work team lies in helping the branch understand the situation, study and analyze the materials, and explain the Party's policies and principles to the branch; the work team can also put forward opinions and suggestions to the branch, but it must let the branch decide the problem itself. Only in this way can we cultivate the branch's ability to independently carry out work in accordance with the Party's principle of collective leadership.
    It is necessary to help the branch organize its strength, give play to the responsibility and enthusiasm of each Party member, and use non-Party organizations and non-Party activists to carry out work. The work team should help the branch in this regard, so that each Party member and each non-Party organization can unite activists and the broad masses to implement the branch's work plan, and change the phenomenon of abstractly calling on Party members to take the lead and empty shouting to give play to the role of various organizations, but in reality, only a few people are busy and chaotic. Therefore, the work team itself should also first prevent the working method of not relying on the Party's branch organization and only using a few branch backbones. In the process of implementing the work plan, the work team should also be good at discovering problems and summarizing experiences to help the branch. In this way, the branch can improve its organizational ability and ability to analyze and understand problems in practical work, absorb experience, and constantly improve the branch's work.
    It is necessary to help the branch consolidate and develop the Party's organization. The work team itself should first overcome the idea of not attaching importance to the Party's construction work, and help the branch learn to constantly struggle against all tendencies that violate the Party's interests in combination with the current work, and cultivate activists to develop Party members in combination with the current work in accordance with the Party's principles. Only by relying on the internal strength of the branch, constantly and constantly carrying out Party construction in combination with practical work, can the Party's organization be increasingly consolidated and strengthened.
    It is necessary to strengthen the close connection between the county and district Party committees and the branch. During the period of the work team's assistance, it can guide the branch to carry out work, but it must pay attention to respecting the powers of the county and district Party committees; for example, issues such as assigning tasks, summarizing work, disciplining Party members, and approving new Party members to join the Party, the work team should not replace the powers of the county and district Party committees. The work team should report the work of the branch to the county and district Party committees at any time, reflect the branch's requirements for the leadership of the county and district Party committees, and explain the instructions and intentions of the county and district Party committees to the branch, so that the connection between the county and district Party committees and the branch is closer. In this way, it will help the county and district Party committees to constantly strengthen their leadership of the branch.

　　农村工作队必须依靠党的支部进行工作
　　张一樵　高华
    最近吉林、山西、河南、湖北、湖南、山东、江苏、浙江等不少省份，都决定从各级领导机关中，抽调大批干部，组成工作队，深入农村进行整顿农业生产合作社、粮食统购统销和整顿党的支部的工作。这是加强农村工作的一项重大措施。
    领导机关派遣工作队深入基层进行工作的方法，是我们党经常采用的行之有效的工作方法。这种方法，可以使党的领导机关在一定时期中和基层群众直接联系起来——及时了解群众的情绪和要求，及时向群众宣传贯彻党的政策，从而有力地完成当前的政治任务；并吸取广大劳动群众在实际工作中所创造的经验，以丰富领导机关的经验，加强对当前运动的指导。但是工作队在进行工作时必须注意一个问题，那就是不能代替也不应该代替党的支部的作用。因为，党的支部是党的基层组织，是党的战斗堡垒，党的一切决议和指示都是通过党的支部团结和组织劳动人民群众来实现的。党的基层组织的成员都是和群众生活、生产、工作在一起，同群众有密切联系的。因此党的支部最熟悉当地劳动人民的情绪和要求，能够根据具体情况宣传贯彻党的政策。在贯彻党的政策方面，党的基层组织还可以组织党员以身作则地为实现党的政策而奋斗，党员的这种实际行动为广大群众接受党的政策树立起榜样，对于党的政策的贯彻有很大作用。所以，凡是已经有了党的支部的地方，不论进行什么工作，都应该依靠党的支部。工作队的作用，只能是按照党的原则，指导支部发挥支部的主动性和积极性，以支部的集体力量，来完成工作任务；同时，帮助解决支部中的问题，提高支部的政治水平和工作水平。在还没有建立起党的支部的地方，工作队有责任结合当前工作，挑选、培养积极分子，帮助当地党委发展新党员，建立党的支部。
    贯彻党的总路线以来，各地党委都派出了工作队在农村中重点试办农业生产合作社。两年来的工作证明了，凡是工作队依靠支部办社，并关心党的支部建设，不断提高支部办社能力的，工作都取得了很大的成绩。山西平顺县西沟、川底等乡，起初由于领导机关派去的工作人员过多，他们进行工作时又不以支部为主，因而一度形成“人人是上级，事事是中心”的混乱局面。以后，工作队纠正了这种缺点，帮助支部坚持了集体领导制度，规定一切重要工作都要经过支委会或支部大会讨论决定，统一计划，因而各项工作的进行、各种政策的贯彻都比较顺利，支部也取得了办社的经验，并给附近各乡的支部和群众树立了榜样。但是至今还有不少工作队在进行工作时不依靠党的支部而包办代替了支部的工作。山东昌南县有些驻有工作队的重点乡的支部委员就反映，他们的“任务有三：一、会前下通知跑腿，二、开会搬凳子提水，三、给上级搞统计数字”；而实际上，有些统计数字，支部还只有到工作队去问才知道。这样做的结果不仅没有发挥和提高支部的作用，而且使支部逐渐丧失了战斗力。工作队离开后，支部仍旧不会办社，不会工作。这种重点乡也就很难起到推动和指导其他党的支部办社的作用。
    要依靠党的支部进行整社、建社等工作，必须同整党、建党结合起来。做好党的支部建设工作，是顺利完成整社、建社等农村各项工作的保证。但是有些工作队的同志认为整顿和发展农业生产合作社同加强党的支部建设工作有矛盾，有的说：“整社建社的任务就很繁重，不能再作支部的建设工作。”这是没有树立依靠支部办社的观念的表现。实际上这些同志还没有懂得如何来办社和如何来加强党的支部建设工作，还没有懂得整顿和发展农业生产合作社同整党建党是两个密切相联的工作。山东寿张县一区，区委副书记在省里参加了农业生产互助合作会议；区委书记在省里参加了党的组织工作会议。在区委会上，一开始，一个说互助合作重要，一个说整党建党重要。后来，他们把本区的农业生产合作社和党的支部的情况作了分析，就发现农业生产合作社发展和巩固的情况同党的支部的好坏完全是一致的，事实说明了两项工作必须结合，于是才把两项工作作了统一的安排。各地的经验都证明了：只有依靠党的支部去办社，并且同时注意支部的建设工作，这样社才能得到发展和巩固，支部的工作水平才能提高；同时也就会发现和培养一批具有社会主义觉悟的优秀分子，为发展新党员作好准备工作。各地的情况也证明了：社内的问题，就是党内所有的问题的反映。例如有些社内混入了地主、富农以及其他破坏分子，那末，不是党内也存在着严重的组织不纯，就是这个支部的领导核心阶级观点模糊、立场不稳或政治警惕性不高；有些社内贯彻党的自愿两利政策有偏差，这个支部中的党员就必然有严重的资本主义思想行为，或放弃了对社的领导；有些乡内互助合作运动不能开展，则一定是这个支部没有办社经验，或者是党员数量过少，不能成为领导团结群众的核心。因此，整顿和发展农业生产合作社，必须同整顿党的支部和发展新党员工作结合起来，凡是党的支部中有严重不纯问题的，必须解决这些严重不纯的问题；凡是党员阶级觉悟不高，政治警惕性不高，工作中有缺点的，必须进行教育，提高觉悟，改正缺点；凡是党的支部没有办社经验的，必须通过整顿发展社的工作，帮助他们取得办社的经验；凡是党员少的支部，必须帮助他们做好发展新党员的工作，壮大党的组织力量。只有这样，才能使党的支部有能力来经常加强对农业生产合作社的领导，随时解决社内的各种问题，使农业生产合作社得到巩固和发展。
    农村工作队应该怎样依靠支部、以支部为主来进行工作呢？我们认为至少应注意以下几点：
    要帮助支部统一安排各项工作。工作队到乡村时就应该注意到：工作队是从领导机关确定了自己的任务的，这些任务必须依靠支部的组织力量，根据当地的具体情况来贯彻实现；同时，支部还有上级各部门布置的经常任务和当地群众中发生的问题需要解决。因此，工作队必须把自己的任务和要求，提交支部，结合本地实际情况，列入支部的工作计划之内，并帮助支部统一安排各项工作，使支部和工作队有统一的工作计划。有了统一的工作计划，就可以使工作队和支部要求一致，步调一致，便于集中力量以支部为主来进行工作。
    要帮助支部按照党的集体领导的原则来进行工作；一切重大工作，都必须经过支部委员会或支部大会来讨论决定。因此，工作队本身首先必须严格执行集体领导的原则，尊重支部委员会或支部大会的职权。在工作中处理各种问题时，工作队的责任在于帮助支部了解情况，研究分析材料，向支部说明党的政策原则；工作队也可以向支部提出意见和建议，但必须让支部自己来决定问题。这样才能培养支部按照党的集体领导原则独立进行工作的能力。
    要帮助支部组织力量，发挥每个党员的责任心和积极性，并运用非党组织和非党积极分子来进行工作。工作队应从这方面帮助支部，使每个党员、每个非党组织都能团结积极分子和广大群众来执行支部的工作计划，改变抽象号召党员带头、空喊发挥各种组织的作用，而实际上仍是少数人忙乱的现象。因此，工作队本身也首先应该防止不依靠党的支部组织、只使用少数支部骨干的工作方法。在执行工作计划中，工作队还应该善于发现问题，总结经验，来帮助支部。这样就可以使支部在实际工作中，提高组织能力和分析认识问题的能力，吸取经验，以不断改进支部工作。
    要帮助支部巩固和发展党的组织。工作队本身首先应该克服不重视党的建设工作的思想，并帮助支部学会结合当前工作、按照党的原则向一切违犯党的利益的倾向不断地进行斗争，并结合当前工作培养积极分子发展党员。只有依靠支部的内在力量，经常不断地结合实际工作来进行党的建设，党的组织才能日益巩固与壮大。
    要加强县、区委同支部之间的密切联系。工作队帮助工作期间，可以指导支部进行工作，但必须注意尊重县、区委的职权；诸如布置任务，总结工作，处分党员和批准新党员入党等问题，工作队都不应代替县、区委的职权。工作队应该随时向县、区委汇报支部的工作情况，反映支部对县、区委领导的要求，并向支部解释县、区委的指示和意图，使县、区委同支部的联系更加密切。这样，才有助于县、区委经常地加强对支部的领导。
