To the Editor:

　　The Northeast Branch of the Central School of Political Science and Law wastes resources very seriously. Last year, the school only completed 34.1% of its student training plan, and the actual number of faculty and staff was only 76.15% of the authorized size; however, expenditures reached 97.7% of the annual budget.

　　How were these funds spent? In last year's capital construction, they added many construction projects without authorization. For example, they added road surface work in front of the school gate, spending an additional 3,590 yuan just on paving large stones. In addition, they added several decorative projects, spending more than 6,000 yuan. The school's original bathhouse was already sufficient, but they built a new bathhouse of more than 100 square meters, with two washbasins specifically for staff at the director level and above, spending a total of 11,266 yuan; in addition, they blindly installed a Cochran-style hard gas boiler worth 21,000 yuan, but because this boiler requires one to two tons of coal per day, they had to stop using it and buy iron kettles to boil water.

　　Even so, the money was still not spent. By the end of last year, they blindly purchased a large amount of equipment, so that expenditures in December alone accounted for 43.7% of the year's total expenditures. At the beginning of the year, they had already bought six sets of sofas with operating expenses without authorization, and at the end of the year they spent more than 1,000 yuan to buy two sets of high-quality leather sofas. The school originally had a jeep, a horse-drawn carriage, and a large car, and at the end of the year they bought a small sedan; this sedan averaged only about one trip per day in May and June of this year, and very few of these trips were for official business, most of them being for private matters such as picking up children, going to department stores, and visiting gardens. On December 31 last year, they spent more than 7,000 yuan to purchase a movie projector set from a private merchant. Because they were eager to complete the transaction, they did not carefully inspect it, and as a result, the quality of the projector was very poor and it frequently malfunctioned. They also bought a large number of washbasins, floral tea trays, flowerpots, and glass panels, many of which are piled up. There were already too many desks and chairs, but at the end of the year a new batch was made. Now all the staff and even the janitors in the school are equipped with leather-covered spring chairs and elaborate desks; many three-drawer desks are used as telephone tables and coffee tables. There are also many coat racks, file cabinets, and beds in the warehouse. In addition to adding too many tables and chairs, the school canteen also bought a noodle cutting machine (worth more than 200 yuan) and a rice washing machine (worth more than 600 yuan), which turned out to be unusable and idle. In short, they spared no effort to spend all the annual funds, forgetting that the state's construction funds are accumulated bit by bit by hundreds of millions of working people!

　　In addition, there is a strange phenomenon in this school: from the principal to the janitors, everyone borrows public funds at will and does not repay them for a long time. Principal Wang Minqiu borrowed 140 yuan of public funds in April last year, and only 40 yuan was deducted by the end of the year, and he continued to borrow this year. Even some people outside the school borrowed money from the school, and they also owed it for a long time. It is worth noting that this year's budget is still huge and unrealistic. The actual expenditure in the first and second quarters of this year accounted for only 17.1% of the annual budget and 30.7% of the plan for the first and second quarters. Among them, the planned fixed asset purchase in the first quarter was 89,000 yuan, but only 2,327 yuan was actually used. The plan was 38 times higher than the actual. The above situation is of course mainly due to the fact that the leading staff of this school love ostentation, pay attention to extravagance, and do not cherish state property; they should conduct an inspection. The former Northeast Administrative Region Political and Legal Committee failed to carefully and meticulously approve the school's budget, and the Liaoning Provincial Department of Finance failed to discover and correct the problem in time after the abolition of the Northeast Greater Administrative Region, which also has a certain responsibility. These lessons are worth remembering by relevant departments.

### 中央政法干部学校东北分校　违犯财政纪律浪费国家资金

　　中央政法干部学校东北分校
　　违犯财政纪律浪费国家资金编辑同志：
    中央政法干部学校东北分校浪费现象十分严重。这个学校去年培训学员计划只完成百分之三十四点一，教职员实际人数也仅为编制的百分之七十六点一五；但是开支竟达到全年经费预算的百分之九十七点七。
    这些经费是怎样花掉的呢？他们在去年的基本建设中，私自增添了许多计划以外的工程项目。例如，增加了学校门前的路面工程，到目前光铺大插石等项就多开支三千五百九十元。另外增加了几项装饰性的工程，花了六千多元。学校原有的浴池已经够用了，但是又新建一个一百多平方公尺的浴池，并设有专为处长级以上工作人员使用的盆池二个，共开支一万一千二百六十六元；此外又盲目安装了一个价值二万一千元的考克兰式硬气锅炉，因为这个炉每天要烧一吨到两吨煤，只好停止使用，又买铁壶烧开水。
    就是这样，钱还是花不完。到去年年底，他们就盲目地大量购置设备，以致十二月份一个月的支出占全年支出的百分之四十三点七。他们在年初已经擅自用开办费买了六套沙发，到年底又花一千多元买了两套上等的皮沙发。学校原有吉普车、马车、大汽车各一辆，年底又买了一辆小卧车；这辆卧车在今年五、六月份每天平均只出车一次左右，其中为公事用的极少，大部分是为了接送小孩、到百货公司和逛花园等私事。去年十二月三十一日，他们又花了七千多元向私商购买电影放映机一套，由于急于成交，未认真检查，结果放映机质量很坏，经常出故障。他们还买了大批的洗脸盆、花茶盘、花盆和玻璃板，很多都积压起来了。办公桌椅，本来已经太多，年底又新做一批，现在全校工作人员甚至勤杂人员都配备了皮面弹簧椅子和讲究的办公桌；许多三个抽屉的办公桌都被当作电话桌和茶几使用。衣帽架、卷宗柜子和床铺等家具也有不少存在仓库里。学校的食堂除了添置了过多的桌椅外，还买了一台切面机（价值二百多元）和一台淘米机（价值六百多元），结果都不能使用而闲置起来。总之，他们不惜千方百计把全年的经费花光，就忘了国家的建设资金是千百万劳动人民一点一滴积累起来的！
    此外，这个学校还有一种奇怪现象：从校长到勤杂人员都任意借用公款，长期不还。王敏求校长去年四月份借公款一百四十元，到年底才扣回四十元，今年又继续借。甚至有些学校以外的人也向这个学校借款，并且也是久欠不还。值得注意的是，这个学校今年的预算编制还是庞大和不切合实际。今年第一、二季度实际开支只占全年度预算的百分之十七点一，占第一、二季度计划百分之三十点七。其中固定资产购置，第一季度计划八万九千元，实际上只用去二千三百二十七元。计划高于实际三十八倍。上述情况的发生，当然主要的是这个学校的领导工作人员爱排场，讲阔气，不爱护国家资财；他们应该进行检查。而前东北行政区政法委员会对这个学校的预算未能认真细致地审批，东北大行政区撤销以后辽宁省财政厅未能及时发现问题，予以纠正，也有一定责任。这些教训值得有关部门深刻记取。　晨光　杨裴
