Every Collective Mess Unit Must Save Food

	The Beijing Third Commercial Bureau's Canteen Begins to Change the Phenomenon of Wasting Food
	Zhang Zhong
	In recent months, the canteen of the Beijing Third Commercial Bureau's has made many improvements in terms of management systems, cooking, and dining, eliminating many loopholes that wasted food and saving the country grain.
	In the past, many staff members of the Beijing Third Commercial Bureau did not cherish food. Walking into the canteen of this agency, leftover rice, leftover steamed buns, and leftover dishes could often be found on the tables. Some bowls had more than two hundred grains of rice left. On the desks and in the drawers of offices, buns and cakes were often dry and hard or moldy, and were eventually thrown into the trash cans and taken away.
	Inside the canteen, due to lax management systems and the lack of a calculating spirit among the cooks, there was also a lot of waste. At that time, the canteen's small warehouse often stored dozens of bags of flour, as well as rice, beans, and the like. Due to poor storage, flour bags were often gnawed through by mice, and other grains were also infested with insects. Last summer, more than twenty catties of millet flour became moldy, and more than ten catties of small red beans were completely eaten away by insects. Every day when washing rice, grains of rice would flow into the sewer. When mixing the dough, the flour would be poured down from a high place, and a layer would fall onto the surrounding ground. The cloths on the steamer racks and the baskets holding steamed buns and corn bread would leave a lot of broken grain residue after each meal, which was thrown away casually. Because the number of diners was not accurately grasped, thin porridge was often left over and poured into the drain.
	In this way, a lot of precious food was discarded.
	This waste phenomenon gradually attracted the attention of the Third Commercial Bureau's Party organization and administrative负责人, as well as the heartache and indignation of many staff members. In April of this year, the canteen's food committee held a meeting, exposing various phenomena of wasting food and determining that in the future, it would plug all kinds of loopholes and conscientiously save food. Subsequently, the administrative负责人 made a report on the issue of food to all staff members, mobilizing everyone to practice strict economy in food. The grassroots organizations of the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union also held meetings for inspection and discussion.
	From May to July, the Third Commercial Bureau administrative负责人, based on the unified arrangements for saving food in Beijing and in conjunction with the specific circumstances of the unit, made five or six consecutive reports to the staff members, further mobilizing everyone to save food. Those who had arbitrarily wasted food in the past recognized the serious political significance of saving food and began to wake up. An atmosphere of cherishing food appeared in the Third Commercial Bureau, and the phenomenon of leftover steamed buns and leftover rice gradually disappeared in the canteen. However, there were still a few people who continued to waste, because they had thoughts such as "I pay for my own meals, it's none of anyone else's business if I waste them." The wall newspaper published by the agency's trade union exposed this shameful behavior. In five or six consecutive issues of the wall newspaper, the people who wasted food were given a harsh satire with words and cartoons.
	Xu Guanglin, the manager of the Third Commercial Bureau's canteen, and the cooks, during this period, thought of many ways to save food. They strove to not only avoid wasting food, but also improve the food so that the comrades would be satisfied. The manager and the cooks studied some of the reasons for the waste that had occurred in the past. They found that leftover steamed buns, corn bread, and rice were sometimes because the portions were too large and the comrades couldn't finish them. So they changed the steamed buns and corn bread to two sizes, and stipulated that rice could be bought in half bowls. In the past, there were few varieties of dishes, and the quality was not good enough, so some people didn't like to eat them and left a lot of leftovers. So they increased the number of dishes, and also stipulated that half plates could be bought. They found that some foods (such as steamed buns, etc.) were loved by the comrades, and they would buy some to take away and prepare to eat next time, but some were left in the drawers and forgotten, resulting in mold and hardening, which wasted them. They posted slogans in the canteen, asking everyone to "eat as much as you buy, don't take it away," eliminating this waste. The manager and the cooks also studied grain storage and other ways to save food. In order to eliminate the waste of inventory grain and avoid the accumulation of grain, the canteen now stores grain for a maximum of five days. They plugged up the rat holes, and bought four rat traps and a rat cage to catch any rats that might appear. When washing rice, a fine wire mesh was attached to block the grain that flowed out with the water. When pouring and mixing the flour, the cooks put the flour bags close to the bottom of the basin, reducing the flying flour, and swept the remaining flour on top of the bags. The cook Xu Gui found a carpenter to add wooden strips to the cracks in the panel, and he also patiently peeled off and picked out the steamed bun skins and broken grains from the cloths on the steamer racks and the baskets every day, then soaked them soft and mixed them into the dough. In June, when green vegetables were on the market in large quantities, the manager and the cooks also thought of ways to use more green vegetables to replace grain. In June, the canteen bought more than six hundred catties of Chinese cabbage, dried it, and made it into bun fillings or added rice flour to make vegetable dumplings. The situation of wasting food in the Third Commercial Bureau began to turn around in April. However, when formulating the grain consumption plan in May, it was found that there was another problem that had to be solved: the bureau's cadres sometimes went out to work, and the cadres of subordinate units sometimes came to the bureau for meetings, so there was a lot of mobility. If the number of diners could not be grasped, the rice and dishes made might often be too much, resulting in waste, and the monthly grain consumption figures could not be reported in advance. As a result of the study of the food committee, each staff member in the bureau was required to make a plan for how many meals they would eat in the canteen each month. In order to more accurately count the number of diners, the canteen implemented a meal registration method: people who ate regularly in the canteen took a red card each time they ate, and those who ate temporarily took a white card. After a week of implementation, the number of diners was roughly ascertained, and the rules were mastered. For personnel from subordinate units who came to the bureau for meetings, the number of people was learned in advance, and the number of dishes to be added was also known. After the implementation of the June grain consumption plan based on the grain consumption situation in May, the statistics at the end of the month showed that the actual number of diners and the grain consumption figures were close to the original plan. The situation in the two months provided a more reliable basis for the canteen to improve management. They calculated that each person ate an average of more than thirty-four catties of grain per month based on the total number of people in the entire agency eating in the canteen each month. Generally speaking, this number is still a bit large, and there may still be waste. In order to further save food, the Third Commercial Bureau, in accordance with the city's unified regulations, arranged for all personnel to formulate a personal grain consumption plan for July in late June. When the work began, a few people set the planned grain consumption too high. After further education and mobilization, the grain consumption plan was reviewed and signed by the heads of each section, and finally made accurate and reasonable. Adding up the individual grain consumption plans, the average person needs about thirty catties of grain per month, which is much less than in June.
	The canteen of the Third Commercial Bureau has made considerable achievements in saving food in the past few months, but the management staff has not been satisfied with this. Huang Lichuan, the chief of the general affairs section, inspects the sanitation situation in the canteen almost every day, and constantly studies ways to save food with the manager and the cooks. Not long ago, leftover rice was found in a bowl in the canteen, and the leaders of the Third Commercial Bureau are preparing to use this incident to conduct education again, to turn saving food into a conscious action of every staff member.

### 北京市第三商业局机关食堂开始改变了浪费粮食的现象

    北京市第三商业局机关食堂开始改变了浪费粮食的现象
    张重
    北京市第三商业局机关食堂，最近几个月来，从管理制度、炊事、用饭等方面作了许多改进，消灭了许多浪费粮食的漏洞，为国家节约了粮食。
    在过去，北京市第三商业局的不少工作人员，对粮食是不珍惜的。走进这个机关的食堂，在饭桌上经常可以发现有剩饭、剩馒头和剩菜。有的碗里剩下的饭有二百多颗。办公室的桌子上、抽屉里，包子、饼都干得发硬或发了霉，最后被扔进垃圾箱里运走。
    食堂内部，由于管理制度不严，炊事员缺乏精打细算的精神，也有很多浪费。那时，食堂的小仓库，经常存放几十袋面粉，以及大米、豆子之类。由于保管不善，面袋常被老鼠咬破，其他粮食有的也生了虫。去年夏天，有二十多斤小米面发了霉，十多斤小豆完全被虫蛀空。每天淘米都有米粒流入阴沟。和面的时候，面粉从高处倒下来，周围地上飞落一层。蒸笼的屉布上，盛放馒头、窝窝头的箥箩里，每顿饭都黏留下不少碎粮渣，被随手扔掉了。由于对用饭人数掌握不准确，稀粥常常剩下来，被倒进地沟。
    就这样，许多珍贵的粮食被丢弃了。
    这种浪费现象逐渐引起了第三商业局党组织和行政负责人的注意，也引起了许多工作人员的痛心和愤慨。今年四月，机关食堂伙食委员会举行了会议，揭发了各种各样的浪费粮食的现象，确定今后要堵塞各种漏洞，认真节约粮食。接着，行政负责人向全体工作人员作了关于粮食问题的报告，动员全体人员厉行节约粮食。党、青年团和工会的基层组织，也都开会作了检查和讨论。
    五月到七月，第三商业局行政负责人根据北京市节约粮食的统一布置，结合本单位的情况，对工作人员又连续作了五、六次报告，进一步动员大家节约粮食。那些过去任意浪费粮食的人认识了节约粮食的严重的政治意义，开始清醒过来。第三商业局出现了珍惜粮食的气氛，食堂里逐渐消失了剩馒头、剩饭的现象。但仍有少数人，因为有着“吃饭我自己出钱，我浪费别人管不着”之类的想法，仍然继续浪费。机关工会出版的壁报揭发了这种可耻的行为。在连续五、六期壁报上，用文字和漫画对浪费粮食的人，作了辛辣的讽刺。
    第三商业局机关食堂的管理员许光林和炊事员们，在这期间，想了许多办法节约用粮。他们努力作到既不浪费粮食，又要改善伙食，使同志们满意。管理员和炊事员们研究了过去发生浪费的一些原因。他们发现，过去剩馒头、窝窝头、米饭，有时是因为个儿太大量太多，同志们吃不了。于是他们把馒头、窝窝头改作成大小两种，规定米饭可以买半碗。菜，过去样数少，并且质量也不够好，有人不爱吃，就剩下许多，于是增加了菜的样数，同时还规定可以买半盘。他们发现有些食品（如包子等），同志们爱吃，吃完还买走些，准备下次吃，有些却被丢在抽屉里忘记了，结果发霉、变硬，浪费掉了。他们在食堂贴出了标语，要求每人“吃多少，买多少，不要带走”，杜绝了这种浪费。管理员和炊事员同志还研究了粮食保管以及其他节约粮食的办法。为了消除库存粮的浪费和避免积压粮食，现在食堂最多存粮五天。他们把鼠洞堵塞起来，并且买了四个鼠夹和一个捕鼠笼，捕捉可能出现的老鼠。淘米时接上细铁丝筛，挡住了随水流出的粮食。倒面和面时，炊事员把面袋放近盆底，减少了飞扬的面粉，并随手翻过面袋扫净上面遗留的面粉。炊事员徐贵找到木工，把面板的裂缝加上了木条，他还耐心地每天把屉布上、箥箩里的馒头皮、碎粮食揭下来、拣出来，然后泡软和在面里。六月间青菜大量上市的时候，管理员和炊事员还想法多用青菜代替粮食。六月份，食堂买下了六百多斤小白菜，晾干后，作成饱子馅或加米面作成菜团子。第三商业局浪费粮食的情况，从四月份开始扭转了。但在五月份制定用粮计划时，发现还有一个问题必须解决：局里的干部有时出外工作，所属单位的干部有时来局开会，流动性很大。吃饭人数如果掌握不住，做出的饭、菜就可能常常偏多，造成浪费，每月用粮数字也不能事先上报。伙食委员会研究的结果，要求局内每个工作人员作出每月在食堂吃多少顿饭的计划。为了更精确地统计用饭人数，食堂实行了吃饭登记办法：固定在食堂吃饭的人，每次吃饭拿一个红牌，临时吃饭的拿白牌。实行一个星期以后，就大体摸清了吃饭人的数字，并且掌握了规律。对于所属单位来局开会的人员，事先了解了人数，增作多少饭菜心里也有了数。根据五月份用粮情况作出的六月份用粮计划实行后，到月底统计，实际吃饭人数和用粮数字是和原计划接近的。两个月的情况，使食堂改进管理有了较为可靠的依据。他们根据每月全机关的人员在食堂用饭的总数字计算，每人每月平均吃三十四斤多粮食。就一般的情况来看，这个数字仍然有些大，其中很可能还有浪费。为了进一步节约粮食，第三商业局按照市的统一规定，六月下旬便在全体人员中布置制定七月份个人用粮计划。工作开始，少数人把计划用粮数定得过高。又经过教育动员，用粮计划经过各科室负责人审查签署，最后作到精确合理。把个人用粮计划加起来计算，平均每人每月需粮大约三十斤，比六月份又减少了许多。
    第三商业局机关食堂几个月来在节约粮食方面有了不小的成绩，但管理工作人员并没有到此满足。总务科长黄利川同志几乎每天都到食堂检查卫生情况，并不断同管理员和炊事员研究节约粮食的办法。不久以前，在食堂里又发现了一个碗里有剩饭，第三商业局的领导方面正准备用这件事向大家再次进行教育，要把节约粮食变成每一个工作人员的自觉行动。
