    Why is the Engineering Quality of the Shenyang Wire Factory So Poor?
    Ming Wen
    The Shenyang Wire Factory renovation project is an important project aided by the Soviet Union in our country's construction. Since the factory officially started construction in 1954, quality accidents have frequently occurred in everything from civil engineering to equipment installation, from the main structure to detailed work, and have not been properly handled for a long time. The main factory building, which covers more than 41,000 square meters, leaks in many places; when it rains heavily outside, it drizzles inside. The elevation of the equipment foundations generally does not meet requirements, necessitating a large amount of shimming. The three stranding machines in the bare stranded wire workshop are only allowed to have shims of 30 to 50 millimeters, with no more than three pieces at each location, but now some shims are as thick as 120 millimeters, with as many as twelve pieces and as few as six. When tightening equipment bolts in the rubber processing workshop, they disregard damage to the bolts and machines and use flat chisels and hand hammers to strike them. When the foundation bolt holes do not align with the equipment, they do not hesitate to bend the bolts, or even use gas to bend them, and force them into place. Of the twenty-three braiding machines installed in the braiding and waxing workshop in May, the base support of one was broken, and the base supports of sixteen had cracks. Other quality accidents, such as errors in foundation engineering layout and honeycombing on the surface of concrete engineering, are also very serious. These serious quality accidents not only cause great losses to the state, but also may affect the normal production of this automated factory in the future, and the quality of the products produced cannot be guaranteed.
    Is the poor engineering quality of the Shenyang Wire Factory caused by the complexity of the project, insufficient technical strength, and lack of experience? It can be said with certainty: no. Although the renovation project of the Shenyang Wire Factory is complex, its technical strength cannot be considered weak. The factory's basic construction department alone has ten sections and more than 300 people, including more than 40 engineers and technicians, and there are often 20 to 30 Soviet experts in the factory helping with design and guiding construction. Soviet experts have made suggestions on the quality problems of many projects, the Electrical Industry Administration of the First Ministry of Machine Building has given instructions, and workers and technicians have raised opinions, so they could have been avoided or rescued in time. But strangely, many of these suggestions, instructions, and opinions are discarded.
    Soviet experts have suggested to the factory more than ten times that foundation engineering should avoid water immersion. When the crane column foundation of the calendering workshop was being constructed, it was immersed in water. The Soviet expert specially invited Deputy Director Luo and Section Chief Gao of the Engineering Department to see it, and said, "In the Soviet Union, doing this is a crime." The attitude of the Soviet expert cannot be said to be insincere, and the opinion cannot be said to be not sharp, but the Shenyang Wire Factory did not accept these opinions, and foundation immersion occurred repeatedly during construction.
    The Electrical Industry Administration's instructions on the quality of the Shenyang Wire Factory renovation project have also suffered the same fate. In the renovation project, the strength of concrete test blocks such as reinforced concrete columns was insufficient. The most serious case was the concrete strength of the boiler room columns, which only reached two-thirds of the design requirements. For this reason, the Electrical Industry Administration instructed them to "handle with caution and draw conclusions" during the project acceptance in February this year. However, the Shenyang Wire Factory has been dragging its feet and has not yet studied and dealt with it. According to the Electrical Industry Administration's provisional regulations on completion acceptance, the Shenyang Wire Factory should establish an acceptance committee to conduct acceptance of the key projects completed in 1954. However, the acceptance committee has not yet been established, and no one in the factory's leadership has paid attention to the acceptance work. The *Shenyang Daily* published a piece of short article entitled "Exceeding the Planned Target", criticizing the Shenyang Wire Factory for neglecting quality. After seeing it, the leaders of the Electrical Industry Administration sent a telegram to the director and Party committee secretary of the wire factory, pointing out that "relevant personnel should conduct a profound self-criticism, and if necessary, conduct a self-criticism at the workers' congress." The leaders of the Shenyang Wire Factory did not pay attention after receiving the telegram. In addition to talking about it within the Party, the director did not pay attention to it after reading the telegram.
    Why can't the Shenyang Wire Factory listen to these opinions for improving project quality? It turns out that their "theory" is: "Progress first, and everything must be subordinate to progress." Of course, it is right to grasp the progress of the project, but grasping progress should start with improving organizational work, and quality must never be sacrificed. The Shenyang Wire Factory has precisely made quality a sacrifice for progress.
    Soviet structural expert Botvinnik suggested that the roof project of the waxing workshop must be carried out after the old steel frame is reinforced, but the Shenyang Wire Factory, because the foam glass laid on the roof was very valuable and the calculation workload was large, simply put the expert's suggestion aside and installed it on its own. In order to rush the progress, they even forced the installation of equipment when the foundation strength had not reached the prescribed standards. As a result, the cross-arm drill and the central lathe in the machine repair workshop cracked the foundation as soon as they were installed, and the corners of the foundation were crushed off after the rubber filter was installed in the rubber processing workshop. In the main factory building, none of the sixteen cranes installed last year can be used. The verticality deviation of the crane installation is only allowed to be three millimeters, but the actual installation reaches forty-two millimeters. Why is there such a large deviation? It turned out that it was almost the end of the month, and in order to make up the workload, after installing a section of crane plate beam on each side, they installed the track without aligning it and lifted the crane up. More than half a year has passed, and no one has considered whether to repair these sixteen cranes or dismantle them and reinstall them.
    Even more serious was that at the end of March this year, Deputy Director Luo heard in his office that the March plan could not be completed, and the first quarter plan could not be completed either, and he became so anxious that he slapped the table and scolded, "You still come to see me if you can't complete the plan!?" Then he ordered the installation section chief to lead the engineers, site representatives, and several technicians from the installation team who could be found after work to lift a mixing machine worth more than 100,000 yuan next to the foundation onto the foundation overnight. More than a dozen people worked all night, but only two feet were installed, and it was dawn. Although the equipment investment was included in the March workload due to the overnight rush, the installation plan was overfulfilled; however, on the morning of April 1, when the installation workers went to work, they saw that the machine was lifted up so hastily and did not meet the specifications, so they had to lift it down and reinstall it.
    The Shenyang Wire Factory's sacrifice of quality to pursue progress can also be seen from their conversations with quality inspectors. Quality inspectors have many opinions on the wrong practice of installing equipment before the concrete strength is sufficient, but they have not received support from the leadership. When the secondary nine-mold and thirteen-mold wire drawing machines were being installed, the foundation still needed two or three days to reach 70% of its strength, but Deputy Director Luo personally said to Peng Qingsheng, the leader of the inspection team, "Lao Peng, there are still more than 200,000 yuan of tasks that have not been completed, let's pull it up first." And he repeatedly said to the inspectors, "You must also pay attention to the progress!" Under the dominance of this idea, there is also the slogan "Pulling up one (machine) is more than 100,000" among the masses.
    The Shenyang Wire Factory has treated the engineering quality of basic construction in this way for a long time. How can serious quality accidents not occur? There are quality accidents here, and there are quality accidents there. The leaders of the Shenyang Wire Factory are afraid of hearing about this, and they adopt an attitude of ignoring it if they can, and muddling through. The rework and repair of the gas pipeline from the copper smelting workshop to the boiler room were inspected on site five times by the wire factory's site representative team and engineering department inspectors, and three times inside the pipeline. The two parties jointly held more than ten meetings, which dragged on for a month and a half without reaching a consensus. Su Tingke, the site representative of Party A, asked Deputy Director Luo for instructions three times and Director Shang for instructions once, and the answers he received were all "Go to Section Chief Gao (the person in charge of Party B)." The site representative felt that the problem could not be solved below, so he wrote a detailed written report to the director, hoping that the director would personally talk to Section Chief Gao. Deputy Director Luo still instructed: "Go and talk to Section Chief Gao. If it can't be solved, then tell me." It seems that the quality problem of the gas pipeline was discovered for the first time, and it seems that the engineering quality is not related to Party A and should be the responsibility of Party B. May I ask: what problem can attract the director's attention and be responsible for handling if a director in charge of basic construction engineering does not pay attention to such a major quality problem and does not take responsibility for handling it? The fate of the sixteen cranes in the main factory building is also undecided. On May 31, Section Chief Gong of the Technical Supervision Section specially raised this issue again, but Deputy Director Luo still did not express his attitude.
    The phenomenon of poor construction quality in the renovation project of the Shenyang Wire Factory can no longer continue. Of course, Party B should bear a great responsibility for the poor construction quality, but can the Shenyang Wire Factory, which is responsible for organizing and supervising Party B's construction, not be held responsible?

    沈阳电线厂的工程质量为什么不好
    明文
    沈阳电线厂改建工程，是苏联帮助我国建设的一个重要项目。这个厂自一九五四年正式施工以来，从土木建筑到设备安装，从主体结构到细部工程，都经常发生质量事故，并且长期没有很好地处理。四万一千多平方公尺的主厂房，有许多地方漏水，外面下大雨，里面下小雨。设备基础的标高普遍不合要求，不得不大量垫铁。裸绞线车间三段绞线机，按照规定只允许垫铁三十到五十公厘，每处不超过三块，现在有的垫铁竟达到一百二十公厘，多的垫到十二块，少的也有六块。橡胶加工车间紧固设备螺栓时，竟不顾损坏螺栓和机器，用扁铲和手锤来敲打。基础螺丝孔和设备对不上时，竟不惜把螺丝打弯，甚至用瓦斯把它烧弯，硬安上去。编织涂腊车间五月份安装的二十三台编织机，有一台的底座支架断裂了，十六台底座的支架发生裂纹。其他如基础工程放线错误、混凝土工程狗洞麻面等质量事故也很严重。这些严重的质量事故，不但给国家造成很大的损失，而且可能影响这个自动化的工厂将来不能正常生产，生产出来的产品不能保证质量。
    沈阳电线厂的工程质量低劣，是不是因为工程太复杂，技术力量不足，缺乏经验，才造成的呢？可以肯定地说：不是的。沈阳电线厂的改建工程虽然复杂，但技术力量不能算弱，仅厂里的基本建设部门就有十个科室，三百多人，其中有四十多名工程师和技术员，而且经常有二、三十位苏联专家在厂里帮助设计和指导施工。许多工程的质量问题，苏联专家早就有过建议，第一机械工业部电器工业管理局早就有过指示，工人和技术人员早就提过意见，因此是可以避免或者是可以及早挽救的。但是令人奇怪的是，许多这方面的建议、指示、意见都被丢在一旁。
    苏联专家曾十多次向厂里建议，基础工程要避免浸水。压延车间吊车柱基施工时浸了水，苏联专家特地请了罗副厂长和工程处高主任去看，并说：“在苏联，这样作是犯罪的。”苏联专家的态度不能说不恳切，意见不能说不尖锐，可是沈阳电线厂并没有接受这些意见，施工中一再发生基础浸水的情形。
    电器工业管理局对沈阳电线厂改建工程质量方面的一些指示，也遭到同样的命运。改建工程中钢筋混凝土柱等混凝土试块的强度不够，最严重的是锅炉房柱子的混凝土强度只达到设计要求的三分之二。为此，电器工业管理局在今年二月工程验收时指示他们必须“慎重处理，作出结论”。但沈阳电线厂拖到现在也没有研究处理。按照电器工业管理局竣工验收暂行规定，沈阳电线厂对一九五四年完工的重点工程应成立验收委员会进行验收。但直到现在验收委员会还没有成立，厂的领导人员中无人过问验收工作。沈阳日报登了一篇“超额完成计划”的小品文，批评沈阳电线厂忽视质量。电器工业管理局领导人员看到后，拍电报给电线厂厂长和党委书记，指出“有关人员要作深刻检讨，必要时得在职工大会上检讨”。沈阳电线厂的领导人员接到电报后，并没有引起重视。除在党内谈了一谈，厂长看过电报以后就不过问了。
    为什么沈阳电线厂听不进这些改进工程质量的意见呢？原来他们的“理论”是：“进度第一，一切服从进度。”抓紧工程进度当然是对的，但抓紧进度应该从改善组织工作着手，绝不能牺牲质量。沈阳电线厂恰恰是把质量当做进度的牺牲品了。
    苏联结构专家保特维尼克曾建议涂腊车间屋面工程必须等旧钢架加固后再施工，但沈阳电线厂为了屋面上铺的泡沫玻璃很值钱，计算工作量大，竟把专家建议搁在一旁，迳自安上去。为了抢进度，他们甚至在基础强度还没有达到规定的标准时，就强行安装设备，结果机电修车间横臂钻和中心车床刚安上就把基础压裂了，橡胶加工车间滤橡机安上后，把基础边角压掉了。在主厂房里，去年安装的十六台吊车没有一台是可以使用的。安装吊车的垂直度偏差只允许三公厘，实际安装竟达到四十二公厘。为什么会发生这样大的偏差呢？原来也是因为当时快到月底了，为了凑工作量，在两边各安上一段吊车板梁后也没有找正就安上轨道，抬上了吊车。到现在已半年多了，这十六台吊车究竟是修理，还是拆下来重新安装，还没人考虑。
    更严重的是今年三月底，罗副厂长在办公室里听到三月份计划还不能完成，第一季度计划也不能完成，竟急得拍桌怒骂：“你们完不成计划还来见我！？”接着就指令安装科长率领下班后还能找到的工程师、工地代表和安装队的几个技术员，连夜去把摆在基础旁边的一台价值十多万元的混橡机往基础上抬。十多人忙了个通宵，还只安了两个脚，天就大亮了。一夜的突击，设备投资额虽然算进了三月份的工作量，超额完成了安装计划；但四月一日早上，安装工人上班时见到机器被这样草率地抬上去，不合规格，只得又抬下来重新安装。
    沈阳电线厂牺牲质量去追求进度，还可以从他们对质量检查人员的谈话中看出来。质量检查人员对混凝土强度还不够就安装设备的错误做法，是有许多意见的，但并没有得到领导上的支持。当二级九模、十三模拉线机安装时，基础还需要二三天才能达到百分之七十的强度，罗副厂长却亲自向检查组组长彭庆升说：“老彭，还有二十多万元的任务没完成呢，拉上去再说。”并多次对检查人员说：“你们也要注意进度呵！”在这种思想支配下，群众中也有“拉上去一台（机器）就是十多万”的口号。
    沈阳电线厂长期以来就是这样对待基本建设的工程质量的。这怎么能不发生严重的质量事故呢？这里有质量事故，那里也有质量事故，沈阳电线厂的领导人员就怕听这方面的情况，采取能不管就不管的态度，混过去。熔铜车间到锅炉房的瓦斯管道返工和补修问题，电线厂工地代表组和工程处检查人员在现场检查了五次，进入管内检查了三次，双方共同召开了十多次会议，拖了一个半月，还没有取得一致意见。甲方工地代表苏庭科向罗副厂长请示了三次，向尚厂长请示了一次，得到的回答都是“找高主任去（乙方负责人）”。工地代表感到下面已无法解决这个问题，又写了一个详细的书面报告给厂长，希望厂长亲自同高主任谈谈。罗副厂长仍批示：“找高主任去谈，解决不了再告我。”好像瓦斯管的质量问题还是第一次发现，好像工程质量是同甲方无关的事，应由乙方负责。请问：一个负责基本建设工程的厂长，对这样重大的质量问题不引起重视，不来负责处理，什么问题才能引起厂长重视和负责处理呢？主厂房十六台吊车的命运也是这样悬而不决。五月三十一日，技术监督科龚科长又特别把这个问题提出来，罗副厂长还是没有表示态度。
    沈阳电线厂改建工程质量低劣的现象是再也不能继续下去了。当然，施工质量不好，乙方要负很大的责任，可是负有组织和监督乙方施工责任的沈阳电线厂难道就可以不负责任吗？
