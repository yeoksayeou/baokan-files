Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 29th - According to a report from the Central Statistical Bureau of the State Planning Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the 27th: The Korean people have already achieved great success in the struggle to restore and develop the national economy in all aspects during the two years since the armistice.

　　In the two years after the armistice, the total amount of national investment in various aspects of the national economy reached 42.8 billion won. In these two years, more than 60 large and medium-sized industrial enterprises were newly equipped with advanced technology and put into production. More than 230 large and medium-sized industrial enterprises that were destroyed during the war and have now been fully or partially restored, expanded and put into production.

　　In the two years since the armistice, due to the construction, reconstruction, and expansion of numerous factories, the output of many industrial products has increased significantly. In the first half of 1955, the total output of state-owned and cooperative industries increased to 2.5 times that of the first half of 1953.

　　In the two years after the armistice, great success was also achieved in agriculture. In the first six months of this year, the state's basic investment in restoring and constructing the rural economy increased to 3.6 times that of the first half of 1953. In two years, the irrigated area has been expanded by 38,000 chongbo (1 chongbo is approximately equal to 15 mu). The sown area in the first half of this year increased by 22,500 chongbo compared to the sown area in the first half of 1953.

　　The construction of the transportation industry has also greatly increased in the two years since the armistice. During this period, a total of 749 kilometers of railway track were laid. The railway freight volume in the first half of this year increased by 84 percent compared to the first half of 1953. The monthly automobile freight volume in the first half of this year increased by 4.3 times compared to the monthly average level before the war in 1949. In the first half of this year, intercity bus lines were extended by 4.5 times compared to the second half of 1953.

　　During this period since the armistice, the patriotic production increase campaign has been launched in industry, agriculture, capital construction, transportation, and other fields, and many labor heroes and thousands of production innovators have emerged. In the first half of 1955, labor productivity in the industrial sector increased by 68 percent compared to the first half of 1953.

　　The material living standards of the people have been further improved.

　　In terms of state-owned and cooperative trade, prices have been reduced three times in the two years since the armistice, with price reductions for 350 kinds of goods. Therefore, the price level in state-owned and cooperative trade in the first half of 1955 has decreased by half compared to the same period in 1953. In the past two years since the armistice, the people's income from price reductions has exceeded 11 billion won.

　　Due to the increase in monetary wages and the reduction in the prices of consumer goods for the masses, the real wages of workers have more than doubled in the two years since the armistice.

　　In the two years after the armistice, there has been rapid progress in the construction of housing and facilities for trade, education, culture, public health, and public welfare. The state's investment in the construction of housing, education, culture, public health, and other public utilities in the first half of 1955 increased to the equivalent of 4.6 times that of the same period in 1953.

　　The Central Statistical Bureau's communique finally stated: These brilliant achievements enable the Korean people to greet the tenth anniversary of the "August 15th" Liberation with a great national confidence and pride.

    战后两年来在恢复和发展经济的斗争中
    朝鲜人民取得巨大成就
    新华社平壤二十九日电　朝鲜中央通讯社二十七日讯：根据朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国家计划委员会中央统计局公布的材料，朝鲜人民在停战后两年中在恢复和发展国民经济的各方面的斗争中，已经取得了巨大的成就。
    在停战后的两年中，国家在国民经济各方面的投资总数达到四百二十八亿圆。在这两年中，用先进技术新装备起来的和投入生产的有六十多个大型和中型工业企业。战时被破坏而现在又全部恢复或部分恢复的、扩充的和投入生产的还有二百三十多个大中型工业企业。
    在停战以后的两年中，由于建设、重建和扩建了许许多多工厂，许多工业产品的产量都显著地增加了。在一九五五年上半年，国营和合作社工业总产量增加为一九五三年上半年的二点五倍。
    在停战以后两年中，农业方面也取得了很大的成功。在今年头六个月，国家在恢复和建设乡村经济方面的基本投资增加为一九五三年上半年的三点六倍。两年中，灌溉面积已经扩大了三万八千町步（一町步约合十五市亩）。今年上半年的播种面积比一九五三年上半年的播种面积增加了二万二千五百町步。
    停战以来的两年中，交通运输业的建设也大大增加了。在这一时期中，共铺设了七百四十九公里的铁路路轨。今年上半年铁路货运量比一九五三年上半年增加了百分之八十四。今年上半年每月汽车货运量比战前一九四九年的每月平均水平增加了四点三倍。今年上半年，城市间的公共汽车线比一九五三年下半年延长了四点五倍。
    在停战以来的这一段期间，爱国增产竞赛运动已经在工业、农业、基本建设、运输和其他方面开展起来，而且出现了很多劳动英雄以及成千上万的生产革新者。工业方面的劳动生产率，一九五五年上半年比一九五三年上半年增长了百分之六十八。
    人民的物质生活水平已经得到进一步的提高。
    在国营和合作社贸易方面，在停战以来的两年中，曾经三次降低物价，降价的货物有三百五十种。因此，国营和合作社贸易方面的物价水平，一九五五年上半年同一九五三年同期相比已经下降了一半。在自停战以来的过去两年中，人民由于降低物价而得到的收益超过了一百一十亿圆。
    由于货币薪金的增加和群众的消费品的价格的减低，职工的实际工资在自停战以来的两年中已经增加一倍以上。
    停战后两年内，在兴建住宅以及关于贸易、教育、文化、公共卫生和公共福利的设施方面都有迅速进展。一九五五年上半年国家在建设住宅及教育、文化、公共卫生和其他公用事业的设施方面的投资金额增加到相当于一九五三年同一时期的四点六倍。
    中央统计局的公报最后说：这些辉煌成就使得朝鲜人民能够怀着一种伟大的民族自信和骄傲来迎接“八一五”解放十周年纪念。
