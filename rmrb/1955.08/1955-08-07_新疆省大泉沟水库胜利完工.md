Xinjiang Province's second modern large-scale reservoir – the Daquangou Reservoir – was victoriously completed on August 1st. The Manas River West Bank Canal, which uses the waters of the Manas River and this reservoir to irrigate farmland, also held a completion ceremony on August 2nd.

The Daquangou Reservoir has a water storage capacity of 32 million cubic meters. It can not only supply water to the nearby production and construction corps' Paotai reclamation area, irrigating more than 60,000 mu of crops during the annual dry season, but also, through the Manas River West Bank Canal, increase irrigation to over 78,000 mu of cultivated land in the Xiaye Di reclamation area. This project started construction in June of last year. The engineering troops adopted a large amount of mechanized construction, working in shifts day and night regardless of winter or summer, cold or heat, and finally completed the project two months ahead of schedule on August 1st, the Army Day, saving more than one million yuan in construction costs.

The head of the Manas River West Bank Canal is located at Yangjiabai in the middle reaches of the Manas River, with a total length of 65 kilometers. The entire canal has more than 30 permanent and temporary structures. In the future, it will continue to extend westward by 100 kilometers. The waters of the Manas River and the Daquangou Reservoir, through the West Bank Canal, can irrigate more than 300,000 mu of fertile land that is currently being developed.

    新疆省大泉沟水库胜利完工
    新疆省第二座现代化大水库——大泉沟水库已在八月一日胜利竣工。引用玛纳斯河和这座水库的水灌溉农田的玛纳斯河西岸大渠，也在八月二日举行了竣工典礼。
    大泉沟水库可蓄水三千二百万立方，不但可以供给附近生产部队炮台垦区六万多亩农作物每年枯水期的用水，而且通过玛纳斯河西岸大渠，还可增灌下野地垦区七万八千多亩耕地。这项工程是从去年六月开始施工的，工程部队采用了大量机械施工，不分冬夏寒暑，日夜分班劳动，终于比原计划提前两月，在“八一”建军节胜利完工。并节省了一百多万元造价。
    玛纳斯河西岸大渠渠首位于玛纳斯河中游的杨家拜，全长六十五公里，全渠道共有永久性和临时性的建筑物三十余座。今后还将继续向西伸展一百公里。玛纳斯河和大泉沟水库的水通过西岸大渠，可灌溉三十多万亩正在开发的肥沃土地。
