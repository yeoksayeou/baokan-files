Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: According to Bangkok newspapers, Thai Foreign Minister Naradhip, while attending a garden party held by the Indonesian Embassy in Thailand to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Indonesian independence on the 17th, spoke to the press about Thai foreign policy.

In response to a question about whether the People's Republic of China could enter the United Nations, Naradhip said that it was possible, but the important thing was the matter of timing, and it must proceed through diplomatic-level meetings.

Regarding the situation in South Korea, Naradhip said that he believed Syngman Rhee's treatment of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission was incorrect. Unless the armistice agreement is invalidated, no one can expel members of this commission from the country. If Syngman Rhee rashly implements a "northward march," that would be a violation of the armistice agreement and would naturally be condemned by world opinion and not permitted by the United Nations. Therefore, Thailand does not agree with South Korea's rude actions.

When discussing Thailand's foreign policy, Naradhip mentioned that some Thai intellectuals had advocated that Thailand follow the neutral diplomacy of India and Burma, and establish a clear neutral policy. He disagreed with this view. He stated that Thailand needs military aid, and neutral countries cannot and do not want to receive foreign military aid.

Naradhip also said that Thailand would follow the resolutions of the United Nations. He defended Thailand's participation in the Manila Treaty Organization, because, according to him, this organization is a concrete manifestation of the spirit of the United Nations. He also said that Thailand's current foreign policy is appropriate. However, he also stated that Thailand's policy should change with the changes in the world situation.

A reporter asked whether Thailand was considering participating in the proposed Asian conference. Naradhip replied that Thailand would certainly be willing to participate. He pointed out that Thailand participated in the Bandung Conference and achieved satisfactory results.

　  泰国外长谈泰国外交政策
    新华社二十四日讯　据曼谷报纸消息：泰国外交部长那拉底十七日在参加印度尼西亚驻泰国大使馆为庆祝印度尼西亚独立十周年而举行的园游会时，就泰国外交政策向报界发表了谈话。
    在回答关于中华人民共和国是不是能进入联合国的问题时，那拉底说，这是可能的，重要的是时间问题，而且必须通过外交上一级级的会议。
    那拉底在谈到南朝鲜的局势时说，他认为李承晚对待中立国监察委员会的作法是不对的。除非停战协定作废，谁都不能驱逐这个委员会的委员出境。假如李承晚贸然实行“北伐”，那就是违反停战协定，自然要受世界舆论谴责，也为联合国所不许，所以泰国不同意南朝鲜的粗暴行动。
    在谈到泰国的对外政策时，那拉底提到，有些泰国知识分子曾主张泰国效法印度和缅甸的中立外交，确定明朗化的中立政策。他不同意这种看法。他表示泰国需要军事援助，而中立国是不能也不希望得到外国军事援助的。
    那拉底又说，泰国将唯联合国的决议是从。他为泰国参加马尼拉条约组织辩护，因为据他说，这个组织是联合国精神的具体表现。他又说泰国目前的对外政策是适当的。不过，他也表示泰国的政策应随世界形势的转变而转变。
    记者问到泰国是否考虑参加拟议中的亚洲会议。那拉底回答说，泰国一定愿意参加。他指出泰国参加了万隆会议，而且获得了满意的结果。
