　　The 44th Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union opened in Helsinki on August 25th. On the eve of the opening, the Union's Executive Committee, merely due to the insistence of a few members such as the United States, unreasonably postponed the issue of the participation of the People's Republic of China's delegation in the Inter-Parliamentary Union, preventing the delegation of the People's Republic of China from participating in the conference. The delegation of the People's Republic of China issued a letter to the President of the Union, the President of the Union's Conference, the Council, the Executive Committee, and all delegates regarding this incident, lodging a solemn protest against the illegal decision of the Union's Executive Committee. We fully support this protest.
　　The accession of the delegation of the People's Republic of China to the Inter-Parliamentary Union is conducive to the cause of maintaining and consolidating world peace. Since the purpose of the Union's charter is to consolidate international peace, promote cooperation among the peoples of all countries, and ensure the peaceful settlement of international disputes through reconciliation; and since the delegation of the People's Republic of China, in accordance with the principles stipulated in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and according to the delegation's own resolutions and charter, seeks to engage in broad contact with parliamentarians from all over the world, develop friendly cooperation among the peoples of all countries, promote peaceful coexistence among all countries, and consolidate and develop the cause of democracy; then, undeniably, the participation of the delegation of the People's Republic of China in the Union, through the Union, to establish direct contact and connection with parliamentarians from all over the world, and jointly discuss major issues concerning the peoples of all countries in international life, is of great benefit to realizing the Union's purpose, further easing international tensions, and building trust between countries. It is inconceivable that the Inter-Parliamentary Union, excluding the delegation of the People's Republic of China representing 600 million Chinese people, could better discuss such important issues as promoting peaceful coexistence among all countries, disarmament, banning weapons of mass destruction, establishing collective peace and security, developing economic and cultural exchanges among all countries, and promoting consultation among all countries, especially major powers, to resolve all international disputes. It is obvious that excluding the delegation of the People's Republic of China from the Inter-Parliamentary Union can only benefit the enemies of international peace and is detrimental to the cause of maintaining and consolidating peace for the peoples of all countries.
　　Now, the Executive Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union has unreasonably postponed the issue of the participation of the delegation of the People's Republic of China in the Union, which in effect is refusing the delegation of the People's Republic of China to participate in the Inter-Parliamentary Union. This is discrimination against the legitimate rights of the Chinese people and an unfriendly act towards the Chinese people. This erroneous decision not only violates the Union's purpose and its entire charter, but also runs counter to the general direction of easing current international tensions, and therefore does not conform to the universal desire of the peoples of all countries for peace. This erroneous decision cannot but bring great damage to the Union's prestige, and if it is not resolutely corrected, it will make the Union in effect a tool of bellicose groups attempting to aggravate international tensions.
　　The illegal decision of the Executive Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union itself violates the Union's charter and undermines the democratic principles upon which the Union is founded and operates. According to a report by the United Press, when the Union's Executive Committee discussed the application of the delegation of the People's Republic of China to join the Union on August 24, only two of the seven members, the United States and Thailand, opposed it. However, the Executive Committee disregarded the opinion of the majority of members and did not pass the application to accept the delegation of the People's Republic of China into the Union, but allowed the United States to play tricks, and with the Lebanese member absent and the chairman not participating in the vote, passed a decision to postpone the discussion with three votes to two, i.e., less than half the votes. This violated the Union's charter, violated the basic democratic principles, and constituted an illegal decision in handling the issue of the delegation of the People's Republic of China's participation in the Union, committing a major error in the Union's history. If the Inter-Parliamentary Union does not resolutely correct this completely erroneous and illegal decision, it will make the Union, like some other international organizations, make its decisions only suit the needs of the enemies of international peace by allowing and succumbing to the conspiracies of certain countries, and make its activities lose their positive influence on international life, which cannot but be regarded as a serious political, legal, and moral misstep by the Union.
　　People see that the Inter-Parliamentary Union has allowed the deliberate obstruction of the United States, and the Union's purpose and entire charter have been undermined. The Union's purpose and charter are to promote international peace, while the United States' obstructionist behavior is to undermine peace. After the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference, the Union has a responsibility to make a beneficial contribution to the further easing of the international situation, while the United States' obstructionist behavior is an attempt to prevent the Union from better fulfilling its due responsibilities. The Union can and should become a place for demonstrating a spirit of reconciliation in international relations and promoting peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, while the United States' obstructionist behavior is undermining the Union's due positive role. Why do certain powerful people in the United States, in addition to obstructing the Government of the People's Republic of China from restoring its legitimate rights in the United Nations, also want to obstruct the delegation of the People's Republic of China from participating in the Inter-Parliamentary Union, a non-governmental international organization? The bellicose elements in the United States spare no effort to exclude the Chinese people from international life, and the reason for this can only be explained as follows: they have ulterior motives. They do not want to end the "Cold War," but want to continue the "Cold War"; they do not want to ease international tensions, but want to aggravate international tensions; they do not want to promote friendly cooperation among countries, but want to create opposition and division among countries. The United States' playing tricks in the Executive Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union to obstruct the delegation of the People's Republic of China from participating in the Union proves that the forces that often play a negative role in other international organizations are also playing their role here. If the Inter-Parliamentary Union truly wants to realize its own purpose and play its positive role in international life, it is necessary to stop this negative role in its own organization that undermines the Union's purpose and endangers the cause of world peace.
　　The purpose of the United States in carrying out conspiratorial activities in the Inter-Parliamentary Union organization is obviously to admit the so-called "parliamentary group" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group that it supports to the Union while excluding the delegation of the People's Republic of China; if this cannot be done, it attempts to practically admit the so-called "two Chinas" to the Union, opening the way for its political conspiracy of "two Chinas" that it is playing. It should be pointed out that all clear-headed and impartial people do not doubt that the only one that can represent China in the Inter-Parliamentary Union is the People's Delegation composed of the representatives of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, just as the only one that can represent China in the United Nations organization is the Government of the People's Republic of China. The Inter-Parliamentary Union should have admitted the delegation of the People's Republic of China to the Union long ago, and should not have delayed it, because the delegation of the People's Republic of China fully meets the conditions stipulated in the Union's charter. Now that this conference has revised the Union's charter, according to the new charter, it should only admit the delegation of the People's Republic of China, and should not make any other considerations. Because as early as six years ago, the Chiang Kai-shek group's so-called "Republic of China" was overthrown by the Chinese people, and only the People's Republic of China exercises national sovereignty on behalf of 600 million people, so only the delegation of the People's Republic of China meets the conditions stipulated in the Union's new charter. The Chinese people firmly oppose the Union's delay in the application of the Chinese People's Delegation, and even more firmly oppose the Union's attempt to admit any "two Chinas."
　　The main topic of this conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union is to ease international tensions and achieve genuine peaceful coexistence among countries. The parliamentary delegations of all countries participating in this conference, including the US parliamentary delegation, cannot deny that the conditions for easing international tensions and achieving genuine peaceful coexistence among countries are to respect the right of the peoples of all countries to choose their own social and political systems, to resolve all issues in international relations through consultation and a spirit of reconciliation, and to establish and develop friendly relations between countries on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. The Chinese people have made unremitting and significant efforts to ease international tensions and achieve peaceful coexistence among countries, and are willing to work together with the peoples of all countries to realize our common aspirations. The delegation of the People's Republic of China is applying to join the Inter-Parliamentary Union with this very purpose. However, the representatives of the US parliamentary delegation are doing everything possible to exclude our People's Delegation, and they do not even dare to sit together with our People's Delegation in a non-governmental international organization. This can only prove that the representatives of the US parliamentary delegation, after the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference, still lack the consultation attitude and spirit of reconciliation necessary to ease international tensions and achieve peaceful coexistence among countries.
　　The Chinese people are peace-loving. The Chinese people are determined to work together with all peace-loving people in the world to ease international tensions and achieve peaceful coexistence among countries. All obstruction and hostility of the American warmongering group is futile. The world's just public opinion recognizes that to solve major international problems, the participation of the People's Republic of China is necessary. We believe that the Inter-Parliamentary Union should be faithful to the Union's purpose and charter and take measures to correct the illegal decision of the Union's Executive Committee to delay the participation of the delegation of the People's Republic of China in the Union.

### 中国人民的严正抗议

　　中国人民的严正抗议
    各国议会联盟第四十四届大会已于八月二十五日在赫尔辛基开幕。在开幕的前夕，联盟执行委员会仅仅由于美国等少数委员的坚持反对，而竟将中华人民共和国参加各国议会联盟的人民代表团参加联盟问题予以无理的搁延，而使中华人民共和国的人民代表团不能参加大会。中华人民共和国人民代表团为这一事件发表了致联盟主席、联盟大会主席、理事会、执行委员会和全体代表们的一封信，对各国议会联盟执行委员会的非法决定提出了严正的抗议。我们完全支持这个抗议。
    中华人民共和国人民代表团加入各国议会联盟，是有利于维护和巩固世界和平的事业的。联盟章程的宗旨既然在于巩固国际和平，促进各国人民间的合作，保证通过和解的方式来和平解决国际争端；而中华人民共和国人民代表团根据中华人民共和国宪法所规定的原则，根据人民代表团自己的决议和章程，又正是要同世界各国议会议员进行广泛的接触，发展各国人民间的友好合作，促进世界各国的和平共处，巩固和发展民主事业；那末，无可争辩地，中华人民共和国人民代表团的参加联盟，通过联盟来同世界各国议会议员建立直接的接触和联系，共同讨论各国人民在国际生活中的重大问题，这对于实现联盟的宗旨，进一步和缓国际紧张局势和建立各国之间的信任，是有极大好处的。不能设想，各国议会联盟排斥了代表六万万中国人民的中华人民共和国的人民代表团而能够更好地讨论像促进世界各国和平共处、裁减军备、禁止大规模毁灭性武器、建立集体和平和安全、发展各国间的经济文化交流、促进世界各国首先是各大国采取协商方式解决一切国际争端这样一些重大问题。显而易见，把中华人民共和国人民代表团排斥在各国议会联盟之外，只能有利于国际和平的敌人，而不利于各国人民维护和巩固和平的事业。
    现在，各国议会联盟执行委员会竟然对于中华人民共和国人民代表团参加联盟问题予以无理的搁延，这在实际上就是拒绝中华人民共和国人民代表团参加各国议会联盟。这是对于中国人民的合法权利的歧视和对中国人民的不友好的表现。这个错误的决定不但违背了联盟的宗旨及其整个章程，而且同当前和缓国际紧张局势的总方向也是背道而驰的，因而是不符合世界各国人民对于和平的普遍愿望的。这个错误的决定，不能不给联盟的威信带来极大的损害，如果不加以坚决的纠正，那就会使联盟实际上成为企图加剧国际紧张局势的好战集团的工具。
    各国议会联盟执行委员会这个非法决定本身就违背了联盟的章程，破坏了联盟所由建立和进行工作的民主原则。根据合众社的报道，联盟执行委员会于八月二十四日讨论中华人民共和国人民代表团申请加入联盟的问题的时候，在七个委员中仅仅只有美国和泰国两个委员反对。而执行委员会竟然漠视多数委员的意见，没有通过接受中华人民共和国人民代表团参加联盟的申请，却容许美国玩弄阴谋诡计，在黎巴嫩委员缺席和主席不参加表决的情况下，以三票对两票，即不足半数的票数，通过了延期讨论的决定。这就违反了联盟的章程，违反了起码的民主原则，而在处理中华人民共和国人民代表团参加联盟的问题上构成了非法的决定，铸成了联盟历史上重大的错误。各国议会联盟如果不坚决纠正这一完全错误的和非法的决定，将使联盟有可能像其它某些国际组织一样，由于听任和屈从某些国家所施展的阴谋诡计，使自己的决定只是适合于国际和平的敌人的需要，并使自己的活动对于国际生活丧失积极的影响，这不能不认为是联盟在政治上、法律上和道义上的一种严重失策。
    人们看到，各国议会联盟竟然容许了美国方面的蓄意阻挠，而使联盟的宗旨和整个章程都受到了破坏。联盟的宗旨和章程是促进国际和平的，而美国方面的阻挠行为却是破坏和平的。在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议之后，联盟有责任对国际局势的趋向进一步和缓作出有益的贡献，而美国的阻挠行为却是企图使联盟不能更好地尽其应尽的责任。联盟能够而且应当成为在国际关系上表现和解精神和在不同社会制度的国家之间促进和平共处的场所，而美国的阻挠行为却是破坏联盟的这种应有的积极作用。为什么美国的某些有权势的人们在阻挠中华人民共和国政府恢复其在联合国组织中的合法权利之外，还要阻挠中华人民共和国人民代表团参加各国议会联盟这个非政府的国际组织呢？美国的好战分子们不遗余力地企图排斥中国人民于国际生活之外，其原因只能这样来解释：他们是有不可告人的目的的。他们不是要结束“冷战”，而是要继续进行
  “冷战”；不是要和缓国际紧张局势，而是要加剧国际紧张局势；不是要促进各国间的友好合作，而是要制造各国间的对立和分裂。美国在各国议会联盟执行委员会中竟然玩弄阴谋诡计，阻挠中华人民共和国人民代表团参加联盟，这证明在其他国际机构中经常起消极作用的势力，在这里也起着它的作用。各国议会联盟如果真正要实现自己的宗旨，发挥自己对于国际生活的积极作用，就有必要在自己的组织中制止这种破坏联盟宗旨和危害世界和平事业的消极作用。
    美国在各国议会联盟组织中进行阴谋活动的目的，显然还要在排斥中华人民共和国人民代表团的同时，接纳它所支持的蒋介石卖国集团的所谓“议员团”参加联盟；如果做不到这点，便企图在实际上接纳所谓“两个中国”参加联盟，为自己所正在玩弄的
  “两个中国”的政治阴谋开辟道路。应当指出，一切头脑清楚态度公正的人士都不怀疑，唯一能够代表中国参加各国议会联盟的是中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会代表们组成的人民代表团，正如在联合国组织中唯一能够代表中国的是中华人民共和国政府一样。各国议会联盟本来就应当接纳中华人民共和国人民代表团参加联盟，而不应当予以拖延，因为中华人民共和国人民代表团完全符合联盟章程所规定的条件。现在，本届大会修改了联盟章程，按照新章程，也只是应当接纳中华人民共和国人民代表团，而不应当作其他任何的考虑。因为早在六年以前，蒋介石集团的所谓“中华民国”就已被中国人民推翻了，代表六亿人民行使国家主权的只有中华人民共和国，因此只有中华人民共和国的人民代表团符合联盟新章程所规定的条件。中国人民坚决反对联盟拖延中国人民代表团的申请，更坚决反对联盟接纳什么“两个中国”的企图。
    各国议会联盟这次大会的主要议题是和缓国际紧张局势和实现各国之间的真正和平共处。参加这次大会的各国议员团，包括美国议员团在内，都不能否认，和缓国际紧张局势和实现各国之间真正和平共处的条件，是尊重各国人民选择自己的社会制度和政治制度的权利，以协商方式和和解精神解决国际关系中一切问题，在互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处等项原则的基础上建立和发展各国间的友好关系。中国人民为和缓国际紧张局势和实现各国间的和平共处已经作了不懈的重大努力，并且愿意同各国人民在一起为实现我们的共同愿望而继续努力。中华人民共和国人民代表团正是抱着这样的目的而申请参加各国议会联盟。但是，美国议员团代表却千方百计要排斥我国人民代表团，他们连在一个非政府性的国际组织中也不敢同我国人民代表团坐在一起，这只能证明美国议员团的代表在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议之后的今天，仍然极端缺乏和缓国际紧张局势和实现各国和平共处所必需的协商态度和和解精神。
    中国人民是爱好和平的。中国人民决心同全世界各国爱好和平的人民一起，为和缓国际紧张局势和实现各国和平共处而共同努力。美国好战集团的一切阻挠和敌视都是徒劳的。世界的公正舆论都承认，要解决国际间的重大问题，必须有中华人民共和国参加。我们认为各国议会联盟应该忠实于联盟的宗旨和章程，采取措施，纠正联盟执行委员会延搁中华人民共和国人民代表团参加联盟的非法决定。
