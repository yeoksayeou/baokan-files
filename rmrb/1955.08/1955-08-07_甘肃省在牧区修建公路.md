Gansu Province will build and renovate seven highways and cart tracks in pastoral areas such as the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and the Gansu Mongolian Autonomous Region this year, with a total length of more than 670 kilometers. The highway from Dunhuang to Changgegou in the Aksai Kazakh Autonomous Region has been completed. The highway from the Huakai Coal Mine to Bayanhaote in the Gansu Mongolian Autonomous Region has begun construction, and the construction of the remaining highways is also being actively prepared.

The construction and renovation of these highways and cart tracks will powerfully promote the economic development of pastoral areas and improve the lives of herdsmen. Maqu in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture is a purely pastoral area. Due to mountain obstruction, a large amount of livestock products here can only be transported by yaks, which is not only time-consuming but also has limited carrying capacity, thus seriously affecting trade with other places. After the cart track is opened, a two-horse cart can carry 1,000 kilograms, which is equivalent to the transportation capacity of more than 30 yaks. The transportation speed can also be increased and the transportation cost can be reduced. From the Aksai Kazakh Autonomous Region to Dunhuang, it is necessary to pass through the desert. In the past, camels were used for transportation. Now, cars and carts are used instead, which is much more convenient than before.

### 甘肃省在牧区修建公路

    甘肃省在牧区修建公路
    甘肃省今年要在甘南藏族自治州、甘肃蒙古族自治区等牧区修建和整修七条公路和大车道，全长六百七十多公里。现在，敦煌到阿克塞哈族自治区长革沟的公路已经完工，甘肃蒙古族自治区的化开煤矿到巴音浩特的公路已经开始施工，其余几条公路也在积极准备施工中。
    这几条公路和大车道的修建和整修，将有力地促进牧区经济的发展和牧民生活的改善。甘南藏族自治州的玛曲，是一个纯牧区。由于大山阻塞，这里大量的畜产品只能依靠牦牛驮运，不仅很费时间，载重量也很有限，因而严重地影响了同外地的贸易。在大车道修通以后，两匹马的大车可以载运
  一千公斤，相当三十多头牦牛的运输能力。运输速度也可以提高，运输成本可以降低。从阿克塞哈族自治区到敦煌，中间要经过沙漠，过去用骆驼运输，现在改用汽车和大车，比以前方便多了。
