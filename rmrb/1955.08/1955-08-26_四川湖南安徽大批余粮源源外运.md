Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 25th: In Chongqing Port, the largest grain distribution center in Sichuan Province, dockworkers are loading large quantities of grain onto ships these days. Several million jin of grain are shipped out from here every day. From January to August 22nd this year, Sichuan Province has overfulfilled its surplus grain shipment plan by more than 53,000 tons.

The amount of Sichuan grain shipped to various regions this year is greater than in the same period of previous years. Compared with the same period in 1954, the year with the highest grain shipment volume, the average daily transport volume this year has increased by 93%. In addition, the amount of grain shipped out from mountainous and marginal areas such as Nanchong, Daxian, and Leshan in Sichuan Province has greatly increased this year, making the grain transfer task in Sichuan this year more arduous and heavier than in previous years. At present, a vast and unified grain transportation network covering the entire province has been formed, with farmers from more than 100 counties in more than 10 special districts across the province participating in this work. Farmers collect large quantities of grain and transport it to areas along transportation lines, and then trains, ships, automobiles, and tens of thousands of wooden boats on more than 70 inland rivers gather these grains to various transfer stations along the Yangtze River.

The areas supplied by Sichuan grain cover major cities and many rural areas throughout the country. This spring, when farmers in Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, and other provinces that suffered from floods last year urgently needed to restore production, Sichuan shipped more than 400 million jin of rice to provide support. Since the third quarter, large quantities of Sichuan grain have been continuously shipped to Shanghai, Wuhan, Hubei, Huangshi, and other places.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, August 25th: On August 21st, more than 2,000 tons of rice were loaded onto trains in Changsha and transported to Beijing, Qingdao, and other places. About 1,000 tons of this batch of rice was processed from the newly harvested early rice. In the first and middle ten days of August, nearly 30 million jin of rice from Hunan had been transferred to Northeast China, North China, and East China.

This year, Hunan has expanded the planting area of double-cropping rice, and early rice has achieved a bumper harvest. Farmers are very enthusiastic about selling grain. As of the 17th, state-owned grain stations in various parts of Hunan had purchased more than 400 million jin of new grain. Since the early rice began to be marketed in Nanxian, which is located on the shore of Dongting Lake, the daily market volume has been over 2 million jin. According to the person in charge of the Hunan Provincial Grain Department, the amount of surplus grain transferred from Hunan to support major cities and industrial and mining areas outside the province in the second half of this year will increase by 70% compared with the same period in 1953, the year with the highest external transfer volume.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, August 25th: Anhui Province, which had a bumper harvest after the disaster, has been shipping an average of more than 3 million jin of surplus grain to Shanghai, Nanjing, Xuzhou, Tianjin, Liaoning, and other places every day since the beginning of August. From July to the present, a total of more than 100 million jin of grain have been shipped out.

Anhui Province suffered from floods last year. Farmers in the disaster areas received a large amount of grain support from all over the country. This year, the 55 million mu of summer-harvested grain crops in the province have generally achieved a bumper harvest. Anhui farmers are grateful for the help given by the state and farmers in various places during difficult times. Now, in addition to actively selling grain to support national construction, they are also working hard to accumulate fertilizer and strengthen field management to strive for a bumper harvest of autumn crops.

　　四川湖南安徽大批余粮源源外运
    据新华社重庆二十五日电　这几天，在四川省最大的粮食集散地重庆港口，装卸工人们正把大批粮食装上轮船。每天从这里运出的粮食有几百万斤。从今年一月份起到八月二十二日止，四川省已超额五万三千多吨完成余粮外运计划。
    今年川粮运到各地的数量，比以往几年的同期都多。同粮食外运最多的一九五四年同期比较，今年每天平均运输量比去年每天平均运输量增加了百分之九十三。加以今年四川省南充、达县、乐山等山区和边沿地区的粮食运出量大大增加，就使今年四川粮食调运任务比历年更加艰巨繁重。目前，一个遍及全省农村的庞大统一的运粮网已形成，全省有十多个专区的一百多个县的农民参加这一工作。农民把大批粮食集运到交通沿线，然后由火车、轮船、汽车和七十多条内河里的成千上万只木船，把这些粮食汇集到长江沿线各转运站。
    川粮供应地区遍及全国各大城市和许多农村。今年春季，正当湖北、安徽、江苏等省去年遭受水灾地区的农民急需恢复生产时，四川各地运出四亿多斤大米前往支援。第三季度以来，大批川粮又源源运到了上海、武汉和湖北、黄石等地。
    新华社长沙二十五日电　二十一日，有二千多吨大米由长沙装上火车运去北京、青岛等地。这批起运的大米中有一千吨左右是由新上市的早稻加工的。八月上中旬，由湖南调运到东北、华北、华东等地的新粮已近三千万斤稻谷。
    今年湖南扩大了双季稻种植面积，早稻已经获得丰收。农民售粮极为踊跃。到十七日止，湖南各地国家粮站收购的新谷达四亿多斤。洞庭湖滨的南县自早稻开始上市以来，每天的上市量都在二百万斤以上。据湖南省粮食部门负责人谈，今年下半年湖南余粮调运支援省外各大城市和工矿区的数量，将比外调量最多的一九五三年同期增加百分之七十。
    新华社合肥二十五日电　灾后丰收的安徽省，从八月初开始，平均每天有三百多万斤余粮运往上海、南京、徐州、天津、辽宁等地。七月份到目前，共已运出粮食一亿多斤。
    安徽省去年遭受水灾。受灾农民得到全国各地大批粮食的支援。今年全省五千五百万亩夏收粮食作物普遍丰收。安徽农民感激国家和各地农民在困难时给予帮助，现在他们除了积极出售粮食支援国家建设外，还努力积肥，加强田间管理，争取秋季作物丰收。
