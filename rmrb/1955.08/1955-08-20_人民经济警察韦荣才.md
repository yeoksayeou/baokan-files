People's Economic Policeman Wei Rongcai of the Guizhou Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau is a member of the Buyi ethnic group. He is resourceful, brave, and loves his work. He was named a first-class People's Economic Police Model at the first Guizhou Provincial Public Security Heroes and Models Representative Conference.

Wei Rongcai worked as a stonemason for more than ten years. In 1954, he was transferred to be a People's Economic Policeman, responsible for the public security and protection of two construction sites. The construction sites had just been established, and things were chaotic in all respects. Timber, tools, and parts were often stolen. Seeing this situation, Wei Rongcai felt even more responsible. Under the leadership of the Party organization at the construction site, he often contacted the local public security station, talked with workers, learned about the situation around the construction site, and assisted in establishing a public security and protection committee on the construction site along with worker pickets. Because he was able to work hard and maintain close ties with the masses, he gained the trust of the workers. From June of last year to the present, he has cracked six relatively complex theft cases and recovered stolen state property. Once, a worker reported to him that Chen Shaoqing, who drove a horse-drawn cart, was stealing materials from the construction site. However, Chen Shaoqing was very cunning. He stole two large screws more than a foot long from the roof truss, fearing discovery, he cut off a piece of the screws and quenched them. To cover up the theft, he deliberately showed the two shortened screws to the person in charge of materials at the construction site, saying that he had bought them. Wei Rongcai saw that one end of the screw was smooth and shiny, and the other end was rusty, and felt that there was a problem. When he investigated, Chen Shaoqing pretended to be righteous and took out a receipt for buying screws from his pocket, saying, "Pure gold fears no fire, I didn't steal, it's useless even if you investigate." But Wei Rongcai did not relax his investigation just because he produced a receipt. It turned out that Chen Shaoqing had made two small screws in a hardware store and obtained a receipt by deception, attempting to block other people's ears and eyes. After verification, Chen Shaoqing could not deny the facts and had to confess his guilt and hand over all the stolen goods.

On the two construction sites, there was only Wei Rongcai as a policeman. He often stood guard for a whole night, and the next afternoon he had to do investigations and organize the workers. One day at noon, it rained heavily, and the timber on the construction site was washed away by the water. The reason was that the construction site was too narrow, and the timber was stacked on the edge of the ditch. When the mountain flood occurred, the water flooded the banks of the ditch. At this time, Wei Rongcai happened to be sick. He was in the work shed, and when he heard someone shouting, he jumped out of bed and woke up the worker pickets who were taking a nap to rescue the timber. More than thirty of them jumped into the ditch to rescue the timber for more than an hour. But the rain was getting heavier and heavier, and more and more timber was being washed away by the water. Not far from the ditch was the Nanming River, and it looked like a large amount of timber was about to be washed into the river. Wei Rongcai climbed up from the ditch and told everyone to stay calm. He braved the heavy rain and ran to the workers' dormitory half a mile away from the construction site and called three or four hundred workers to retrieve all the timber that had been washed away by the water. When Wei Rongcai returned to the work shed, he was dizzy, and his legs could no longer move.

Wei Rongcai's deeds in protecting the construction site are spreading everywhere among the workers.

    人民经济警察韦荣才

    贵州省建筑工程局人民经济警察韦荣才，是布依族人。他机智、勇敢，热爱自己的工作，在贵州省首届公安功臣模范代表会议上被评为一等人民经济警察模范。
    韦荣才干过十多年的石工，一九五四年被调任人民经济警察，负责两个工地的治安保卫工作。工地刚刚建立不久，各方面都很混乱，木材、工具、零件常被盗窃。韦荣才看到这种情形，更感到自己责任的重大。他在工地党组织的领导下，经常和公安派出所取得联系，找工人谈话，了解工地周围的情况，并协助建立工地上的治安保卫委员会同工人纠察队。由于他能够艰苦工作，密切联系群众，因而得到了工人的信任。从去年六月到现在，他破获了六起比较复杂的盗窃案件，追查出被盗窃的国家财产。有一次，工人向他报告赶马车的陈绍清偷工地上的材料。可是陈绍清很狡猾，他盗窃了上梁架的两个一尺多长的大螺丝，怕被人发觉，将螺丝截去一块，又淬了火。为了掩盖盗窃行为，他还故意把两个截短了的螺丝拿给工地上管材料的人看，说是买来的。韦荣才看到螺丝一头光滑发亮，一头生锈，觉得有问题。在他追查的时候，陈绍清装着理直气壮的样子，从口袋里掏出一张买螺丝的发票，说：“真金不怕火炼，我没偷，你就是查也没用。”但是韦荣才并没有因为他拿出了单据就放松了追查。原来陈绍清曾在一个铁器铺里打过两个小螺丝，骗得一张发票，企图堵塞别人的耳目。经过对证，陈绍清在事实面前无法抵赖，只得认了罪，交出了全部盗窃的东西。
    在两个工地上，只有韦荣才一个警察，他常常站一夜的岗，第二天下午还要做调查和组织工人的工作。有一天中午，下大雨，工地上的木材被水冲去了。原因是工地太窄，木材堆放在沟沿上，山洪一发，水漫上了沟的两岸。这时正赶上韦荣才生病，他在工棚里，听到有人喊就一骨碌从铺上爬起来，叫醒了正睡午觉的工人纠察队去抢救木材。他们三十多个人跳到沟里抢救了一个多小时。但是雨越下越大，木材被水冲下去的越来越多。离沟不远的地方就是南明河，眼看大批木材就要被冲到河里去。韦荣才从沟里爬上来，叫大家沉住气，他冒着大雨，跑到离工地半里路的工人宿舍，叫来了三四百工人，把被水冲下去的木材全部打捞上来。当韦荣才回工棚的时候，他头发晕，两条腿已经走不动了。
    韦荣才保卫工地的事迹在工人中到处流传着。
