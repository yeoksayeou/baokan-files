    National Funds Cannot Be Wasted Under Any Pretext
    —Notes from Attending the Eighth Congress of the Henan Provincial Committee of the CPC
    Zhang Jianhong

    In June, the Henan Provincial Committee of the CPC convened the Eighth Provincial Party Congress. At the meeting, in accordance with the requirements of the draft of the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy by the Central Committee, the Congress studied how to vigorously practice economy and oppose waste in industrial production and capital construction in the future, in order to save and accumulate funds for the country.

    Over the past five years, industrial construction in Henan Province has developed vigorously. The proportion of the total industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value of the province has increased from 4.21% in 1950 to 14.57% in 1954. Over the past five years, industrial and mining enterprises in Henan Province have manufactured more than 220 kinds of products for the country, which has appropriately met the needs of production and life of urban and rural people, and has played a certain role in supporting agricultural development. After the state began planned economic construction in 1953, Henan Province also built and rebuilt many factories, mines, and schools, and began new urban construction. In addition to affirming the achievements, the meeting pointed out that, due to our past insufficient attention to the issue of thrift, lack of understanding or insufficient understanding of the significance of thrift for accumulating socialist construction funds, and also due to the fact that we paid more attention to production and less attention to financial costs in the work of the past few years, serious waste has been caused in the current industrial construction and production. Accordingly, the meeting exposed and criticized various erroneous ideas that caused waste.

    The idea of ​​"leniency in planning and stringency in use" is prevalent in capital construction units in Henan Province. Some units overestimate and overcalculate when preparing investment plans, and use the surplus funds to build more or purchase more equipment for their own units. The Engineering Office of the Henan Provincial Department of Education in Zhengzhou had a surplus of funds accounting for 27.6% of the total investment in 1953, and another surplus of funds accounting for 15% of the total investment in 1954. As a result, these surplus funds were used to build more classrooms and purchase more cars. Projects outside the plan of this unit accounted for 13% of the total investment area in 1953. The planned cost of a classroom building in Zhengzhou Normal School was 29.98% higher than the actual expenditure. The First High School used the budget surplus to build an extra building, calling it the "Economy Building." They also believed that "anyway, it did not exceed the budget." When purchasing materials and equipment, some units did not act according to actual needs, but blindly purchased too much, resulting in serious backlog. The steel bars, cement, steel pipes, machinery, and wood stored by the Luoyang Engineering Bureau all exceeded the proper storage volume. The backlog waste of purchasing straw mats in the winter of last year alone amounted to 232,438 yuan. The leading comrades of this unit believed that buying more would be useful, so as not to be caught off guard when the snow fell heavily. A construction unit in Luoyang purchased 15,000 tons of cement more when building the Jianhe Bridge on the railway special line. They believed that this would allow them to "be prepared for any eventuality." The newly built state-owned Zhengzhou First Cotton Textile Factory. According to the state-stipulated consumption quota and reserve quota standards, the backlog of machinery and materials alone is worth 270,000 yuan, and the loss and waste accounts for about one-tenth. They have a reserve of 1,000 roving spindles, each with a lifespan of 70 years, and can still be used for 30 years after repair. It is obviously a great waste to have so many spare parts for new machines.

    Among the comrades engaged in urban construction, there is a one-sided idea of ​​building large cities. Zhengzhou and Luoyang are two modern cities under construction in Henan Province. The guiding ideology for the construction of these two cities was initially very unclear. In terms of planning and design, they all blindly pursued excessively high standards without considering the state's funds. In the construction of Zhengzhou, the original urban conditions were not fully utilized, and the topography and the distribution of existing buildings were not seriously considered. As a result, the urban plan was divorced from reality, and too many houses were demolished, which increased the construction investment; in addition, the one-sided pursuit of the grandeur of large cities resulted in unreasonable planning and shocking waste, and the planning was changed many times, which affected the construction of many construction units. Construction could not start for a long time, and even the design had to be modified. When planning the city, Zhengzhou rarely considered the requirements of socialist industrial construction, and designated the industrial area and the city center in places with high groundwater levels, low soil loads, and particularly strong wind and sand. Later, it had to change the original plan and put the industry and the city center - also west of Jinghan Road and south of Longhai Road. As a result, the provincial leading organs under construction are far away from the city center and industrial area, and are located in a corner of the old city northeast. The "Cultural Zone" currently located in the northern suburbs is also the result of past planning errors. A medium-sized city like Zhengzhou should not form a separate area at all. This serious error in urban planning has caused incalculable waste in all aspects. The original design of urban construction in Luoyang was also very uneconomical and unsuitable (for example, the rainwater pipes were designed according to the highest rainfall in previous years, and the diameter of the pipes reached three meters, and the pipes were wide enough for a jeep to run through. It is said that even the large cities in the Soviet Union rarely have such rainwater pipes).

    The representatives also exposed the excessive extravagance of some enterprises and units in their daily work and living equipment. Zhengzhou Grinding Wheel Factory bought drawing pencils, and disliked the one-jiao domestic products, so they had to buy imported products at two yuan each. The temporary dormitories and offices of the Luoyang Engineering Bureau headquarters were all paved with beautiful wooden floors and partitioned with plywood; in terms of appliances, they bought spring beds instead of wooden beds, and disliked the local chairs, so they had to buy Shanghai chairs. In the start-up expenses of a factory, high-end medical equipment that was not needed or would not be used was purchased for 2,000 yuan.

    The meeting pointed out that the above-mentioned phenomena of backlog and waste are serious. In order to do a good job in socialist construction, everyone must earnestly learn lessons from them. However, some comrades have adopted an extremely wrong attitude towards these facts. They believe that we do not have experience in large-scale construction, so waste is inevitable; or they isolate the waste phenomena one by one and regard them as insignificant small matters, so they relax the necessary supervision and inspection of many waste phenomena, and objectively play a role in condoning waste. The meeting criticized this erroneous attitude and viewpoint. It pointed out that the main reason for the major backlog and waste incidents that have occurred is not due to lack of experience, but rather to problems with the leadership's thinking. These wastes are not insignificant small matters, but have consumed a large amount of the country's funds. The meeting believes that if we are inexperienced in building large-scale projects, it is indeed easy to cause waste; however, we should try our best to avoid and reduce waste, and we should not fail to prevent waste because there is a possibility of waste. Experience has proved that construction units and engineering units that have had this kind of erroneous guiding ideology have all experienced various kinds of waste and backlog phenomena to varying degrees. The basic construction units in Luoyang City have a very deep understanding of this point.

    The meeting believes that the root cause of the above-mentioned erroneous guiding ideology is subjectivism divorced from reality. These comrades did not comprehensively consider today's construction issues from the international environment and the domestic economic situation, etc., and did not use state funds based on the current needs and possibilities, but blindly demanded large scale, emphasized long-term plans, and prematurely pursued "socialist standards." At the same time, the principles of practicing thrift and opposing waste repeatedly put forward by the Party Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee have not been resolutely implemented in the capital construction units. And these are inseparable from the right-leaning thoughts that exist in the Party at present. Many comrades have not been resolute enough in the struggle against many erroneous ideas that have caused serious waste. In the construction cause, they have been influenced by bourgeois ideology, pursued luxury, and relaxed their vigilance against waste. As some comrades said: "The phenomenon of waste has gone from heartache to habit, and finally become commonplace."

    The meeting pointed out that in the past two months, all parts of the province have followed the instructions of the Central Committee and have achieved initial results in the struggle to practice thrift and oppose waste. The phenomenon of waste has been somewhat overcome, and various erroneous ideas have begun to be criticized and have changed somewhat. The current problems are: more inspection and less improvement, and insufficient mobilization of the masses. Therefore, the important task in the future is: according to the instructions of the Central Committee and the resolution of the National Party Congress, closely combined with the actual situation in Henan Province, to further carry out a comprehensive economy movement on the capital construction and industrial fronts, improve enterprise management, reduce costs, and improve labor productivity, and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the national plan. To this end, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, form a strong supervisory force and public opinion force against waste and practice thrift, criticize and thoroughly correct various erroneous ideas, and continue to carry forward the Party's tradition of hard work and the fine style of diligence and thrift in socialist construction.

    不能以任何借口浪费国家资金
    ——中共河南省第八次代表会议旁听记
    张健虹
    六月，中共河南省委召开了第八次全省党代表会议。会上根据中央发展国民经济第一个五年计划草案的要求，研究了今后如何在工业生产和基本建设中，厉行节约，反对浪费，为国家节约和积累资金的问题。
    五年以来，河南省的工业建设有了蓬勃的发展。全省工业总产值占工农业总产值的比重，由一九五零年的百分之四点二一，递增到一九五四年的百分之十四点五七。五年来河南省的工矿企业共为国家制造了二百二十余种产品，适当地满足了城乡人民生产和生活的需要，对农业发展起了一定的支援作用。一九五三年国家开始有计划的经济建设后，河南省又新建和改建了许多厂矿、学校，并开始了新的城市建设。会议除了肯定成绩外，指出，由于我们过去对节约问题重视不够，不了解或不甚了解节约对于积累社会主义建设资金的意义，加之，在这几年的工作中注意生产多，注意财务成本少，因而造成了目前工业建设和生产中的严重浪费。据此，会议对造成浪费的形形色色的错误思想，进行了揭发和批判。
    宽打窄用的思想在河南省的基本建设单位中是普遍存在的。有些单位在编造投资计划时高估多算，把结余款给本单位多兴建或多购置各种设备。河南省教育厅在郑州的工程处，一九五三年结余款占总投资的百分之二十七点六，一九五四年结余款又占总投资的百分之十五，结果就用这些结余款多盖教室，多购汽车。这个单位计划以外的工程在一九五三年占总投资面积的百分之十三。郑州师范一个教室楼计划造价高于实际支出百分之二十九点九八。第一高中用预算结余款多盖了一座楼房，称之为“节约楼”。他们还认为“反正没有超过预算”。在购置材料和设备时，有些单位不根据实际需要，盲目多购，以致造成严重积压现象。洛阳工程局储备的钢筋、水泥、钢管、机具、木材等，都超过了应有的储备量，仅去年冬季购买草席一项的积压浪费，即达二十三万二千四百三十八元。这个单位的领导同志认为多买了有用处，免得雪落大了措手不及。洛阳某建设单位，在做铁路专用线上的涧河大桥中，多购水泥一万五千吨。他们认为这样就可以“有备无患”。新建的国营郑州第一棉纺织厂。按照国家规定的消耗定额和储备定额的标准来检查，仅机物料一项积压就值二十七万元，损失浪费占十分之一左右。他们储备了粗纱锭子一千根，每根寿命达七十年，再经修理后，还可用三十年，新机器有这样多的备料，显然是很大的浪费。
    在从事城市建设的同志中有着片面的建筑大城市的思想。郑州和洛阳是河南省正在兴建中的两个近代化城市。建设这两个城市的指导思想，最初是很不明确的。在规划和设计方面，都是一味追求过高的标准，而没有顾惜国家的资金。郑州市在建设中，没有充分利用原有的城市条件，没有认真地考虑地形和既有建筑物的分布，因而使城市规划脱离了实际，过多地拆迁房屋，增加了建设投资；加上片面地追求大城市气魄，以致形成了规划的不合理和惊人的浪费，而且规划多次变更，影响许多建筑单位迟迟不能开工，甚至连设计也要跟着修改。郑州市在规划城市时，很少从社会主义工业建设的要求考虑问题，把工业区和市中心指定在地下水位高、土壤负荷低、风沙特别大的地方，后来不得不改变原来规划的方案，把工业和市中心——也放在京汉路以西，陇海路以南。结果就使得正在建筑中的省级领导机关远离市中心和工业区，偏处于旧市区东北一隅。目前位置在北郊的“文化区”，也是过去规划错误造成的，像郑州这样的中等城市，根本不应该单独形成一个区域。城市规划上的这种严重的错误，给各方面造成的浪费是不可估量的。洛阳的城市建设，原有的设计也是很不经济很不适用的（如雨水管是按历年最高雨量设计的，管子的直径达三公尺，管道里面宽畅得可以跑过吉普车。据说苏联的各个大城市，也少有这样的雨水管）。
    代表们还揭发了某些企业单位在日常工作和生活设备上的过分奢侈。郑州砂轮厂买绘图铅笔，嫌一角一支的本国货不好，要买二元一支的进口货。洛阳工程局局本部的临时性宿舍、办公室都铺了漂亮的木地板，用三夹板隔墙；在用具方面，有木床不用，要买棕床，嫌本地椅子不好，要买上海的。某厂在筹办费用的开支中，买来用不着或不会用的高等医药器材就价值两千元。
    会议指出，上述各项积压浪费现象是严重的。为了搞好社会主义建设，大家必须切实从中吸取教训。但是有的同志对于这类事实却采取了极端错误的态度。他们认为我们没有从事大规模建设的经验，因而浪费是不可避免的；或是把浪费现象一件件地孤立起来看，认为是微不足道的小事情，因而对许多浪费现象放松了必要的监督和检查，客观上对浪费起了纵容的作用。会议批判了这种错误的态度和看法。指出已经发生的重大积压浪费事件，其主要原因都不是由于没有经验，而是领导思想有毛病。这些浪费更不是微不足道的小事情，而是损耗了国家的大量资金。会议认为，兴建大规模的工程，我们业务生疏没有经验，的确容易发生浪费；但是，我们应该努力设法来避免和减少浪费，而不应该因为有浪费的可能就不去防止浪费。经验证明：有过这种错误指导思想的建设单位和工程单位，都发生了程度不同的各种各样的浪费、积压现象。洛阳市各基本建设单位对于这一点的体会是很深刻的。
    会议认为：上述错误指导思想的根源是脱离实际的主观主义。这些同志不是全面地从国际环境和国内经济情况等来考虑今天的建设问题，不是根据当前的需要和可能出发来使用国家资金，而是盲目地要求大规模，强调百年大计，过早地追求“社会主义标准”。同时，在基本建设单位中对党中央、省委一再提出的厉行节约的原则，贯彻得不够坚决。而这些和当前党内存在的右倾思想是分不开的。很多同志对许多造成严重浪费的错误思想的斗争不够坚决，在建设事业中，受了资产阶级思想影响，追求豪华，放松了对浪费的警惕。正如有的同志所说：“对浪费现象是由心痛到习惯，最后熟视无睹”。
    会议指出，最近两月来，全省各地遵循中央的指示，在厉行节约反对浪费的斗争中，已取得初步成绩，浪费现象已有所克服，各种错误思想开始受到了批判而有所转变。目前存在的问题是：检查的多改进的少，发动群众不够。因此，今后的重要任务是：根据中央指示，根据全国党代表会议的决议，紧密结合河南省的实际情况，在基本建设和工业战线上进一步开展全面节约运动，改进企业管理，降低成本，提高劳动生产率，保证国家计划的完成和超额完成。为此，必须充分发动群众，依靠群众，形成反对浪费厉行节约的强大的监督力量和舆论力量，批判并彻底纠正各种各样的错误想法，在社会主义建设中继续发扬我党艰苦奋斗的传统和克勤克俭的优良作风。
