　　Dongtingwei Agricultural Cooperative Sells Surplus Grain at Double the Original Target

The Dongtingwei Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wangjia Township, Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, suffered a major flood unprecedented in a century in 1954, resulting in a complete loss of more than 1,000 mu of paddy fields. Thanks to the help of the Party and the People's Government, they rebuilt their homes after the disaster and reclaimed more than 580 mu of barren land. This year, the cooperative achieved a bumper harvest. More than 1,000 mu of early rice yielded a total of 710,000 jin of rice, an average of more than 680 jin per mu, of which more than 300 mu averaged more than 817 jin per mu. More than 350 mu of mid-season rice also averaged more than 700 jin per mu. The total output of early and mid-season rice in the cooperative has doubled compared to 1953. The income of all 127 cooperative member households has increased.

In order to thank the Party, the People's Government, and the people of the whole country for their support, the cooperative decided to sell 600,000 jin of early rice to the state and sell 800,000 jin for the whole year to support national industrial construction. This is double the target set by the "Three Fixes" (三定). The cooperative is currently delivering the grain to state warehouses.

　　洞庭围农业合作社卖出余粮比原定任务多一倍
    湖南省湘阴县王家乡洞庭围农业生产合作社，一九五四年因遭受了百年未有的大水灾，全社一千多亩稻田颗粒无收。由于党和人民政府的帮助，灾后又重建家园，并开垦了五百八十多亩荒洲。今年全社获得了大丰收，一千多亩早稻共收了七十一万斤稻谷，平均每亩达六百八十多斤，其中有三百多亩平均每亩收八百一十七斤。三百五十多亩中稻，平均每亩也有七百多斤。全社早、中稻的总产量比一九五三年增加了一倍。一百二十七户社员户户都增加了收入。
    为了感谢党、人民政府和全国人民对他们的支援，该社决定卖给国家六十万斤早稻，全年卖八十万斤，支援国家工业建设。比三定规定的任务增加了一倍。目前该社正将粮食送往国家仓库。
