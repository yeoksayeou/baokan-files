    Strengthening Cooperation Between Industrial and Scientific Research Departments
    Yu Kangjin
    The realization of socialist industrialization is inseparable from scientific research. Modern large-scale industry equipped with high technology requires various scientific research institutes or scientific laboratories to serve it. Strengthening cooperation between production enterprises and scientific research departments and universities is an important method to make science serve production.
    The Ministry of Heavy Industry recently issued a "Notice on Strengthening Cooperation Between Production Enterprises and Scientific Research Departments and Universities." This is an important document showing that industrial departments are paying attention to strengthening ties and cooperation with scientific research departments and universities. It is hoped that all industrial departments will pay attention to this document and improve their work in this area according to their own circumstances.
    Strengthening cooperation between production enterprises and scientific research departments can enable scientific research departments to regularly understand the situation and requirements of production enterprises, so that their research work can be combined with practice to solve major scientific and technological problems in production, and the research results can be applied to production in a timely manner. In this way, the production and technical level of production enterprises can be continuously improved. Through cooperation, production enterprises can put forward certain requirements to scientific research departments, provide new problems and research materials that need to be studied, which can open up new fields for scientific research, thereby promoting scientific progress. Through cooperation, it is also possible to more effectively train scientific and technical cadres, so that researchers in scientific research departments have the opportunity to go deep into factories and mines to obtain practical production knowledge; technical personnel in factories and mines can increase their theoretical knowledge and experimental research work experience with the help and cooperation of scientific research departments, and university students can also obtain production internship places according to contracts, while also providing certain assistance to production enterprises. It can be seen that strengthening this cooperation is of great significance for developing scientific undertakings, improving production technology, and training cadres.
    In order to achieve this, it is hoped that the leaders of scientific research departments and production enterprises can establish a long-term cooperation perspective. The achievement of scientific research results and the improvement of the technical level of enterprises must go through long-term arduous efforts. However, there are still some ideas of mutual contempt and disagreement between the engineering and technical personnel of some production enterprises and the researchers of scientific research departments, and individual enterprise leaders also have ideas of being afraid of trouble and affecting production, and are unwilling to allow scientific research personnel to conduct on-site experimental work, and are unwilling to accept university students going to factories and mines for internships. This will inevitably hinder the cooperation between science and production, and hinder the cooperation and assistance between factory and mine technical personnel and scientific research personnel. Only by eliminating these ideological obstacles can close cooperation between industrial departments and scientific research departments and universities be truly established.

    加强产业部门同科学研究部门的合作
    俞康金
    实现社会主义工业化，离不开科学研究工作。用高度技术装备起来的现代大工业，需要有各种科学研究所或科学实验室为它服务。加强生产企业同科学研究部门及高等学校的合作，是使科学为生产服务的重要方法。
    重工业部最近发出了“关于加强生产企业和科学研究部门及高等学校协作”的通知。这是产业部门注意加强同科学研究部门和高等学校的联系和合作的一个重要文件。希望各产业部门注意这个文件，并根据自己的情况改进自己在这方面的工作。
    加强生产企业和科学研究部门之间的合作，可以使科学研究部门经常了解到生产企业的情况和要求，使它们的研究工作能够结合实际，解决生产中的重大的科学技术问题，把研究成果及时应用到生产中去。这样，生产企业的生产和技术水平也就能够不断提高。通过合作，生产企业可以向科学研究部门提出一定的要求，提供需要研究的新问题和研究资料，这就能够给科学研究开辟新的领域，从而推动科学前进。通过合作还能够更有效地培养科学技术干部，使科学研究部门的研究人员有机会深入厂矿，获得实际生产知识；厂矿的技术人员可以在科学研究部门的帮助和合作下增进理论知识和试验研究的工作经验，高等学校的学生也能够根据合同得到生产实习场所，同时也给生产企业以一定的帮助。由此可见，加强这种合作对发展科学事业和提高生产技术水平以及培养干部都有很大的意义。
    为了做到这一点，希望科学研究部门和生产企业的领导人员能够树立起长期合作的观点。科学研究成绩的取得，企业技术水平的提高，都必须经过长期的艰苦的努力。但是，在某些生产企业的工程技术人员和科学研究部门的研究人员间还有一些互相轻视、互不服气的思想，而个别的企业领导人员也有怕麻烦、怕影响生产的思想，不愿科学研究机关的人员到现场进行试验工作，不愿接受高等学校学生下厂矿实习。这样，必然会妨害科学和生产的合作，妨碍厂矿技术人员和科学研究人员彼此间的合作和帮助。只有扫除这些思想障碍，才能真正建立起产业部门同科学研究部门、高等学校间的密切合作。
