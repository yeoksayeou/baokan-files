    Statement by Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China on the Issue of the Japanese Government's So-Called Withdrawal of Japanese Remaining in Mainland China
    Xinhua News Agency Report
    The following is the full text of a statement by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:
    On July 15, 1955, the Japanese Consul General in Geneva, representing the Japanese government, handed the Consul General of the People's Republic of China in Geneva a note on the so-called "request for repatriation of Japanese nationals." On July 16, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a public statement on the so-called "issue of withdrawing Japanese remaining in mainland China." In the note and the public statement, the Japanese government made baseless accusations and unilateral unreasonable demands. Regarding this, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issues the following statement:
    First, regarding the issue of overseas Chinese. The government of the People's Republic of China has always provided various conveniences to Japanese overseas Chinese in China who are willing to return to their country. By the end of March 1955, through the joint efforts of the Chinese Red Cross Society, the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japanese Peace Liaison Committee, approximately 29,000 of the original total of approximately 35,000 Japanese overseas Chinese who were willing to return to their country had returned to Japan. There are still more than 6,000 Japanese overseas Chinese residing in China, and they have expressed their willingness to reside in China long-term or temporarily. If any of them change their minds and apply to return to their country, the Chinese government will still provide various conveniences, and the Chinese Red Cross Society will do its best to assist. This point was agreed upon by the Chinese Red Cross Society delegation and the Japanese Red Cross Society and other groups when they visited Japan. Now the Japanese government is making the baseless accusation that "the issue of withdrawing overseas Chinese has made no progress." On the contrary, China has tens of thousands of overseas Chinese in Japan, and their legitimate rights and interests have not received due care. Their contact with their motherland and families is still being obstructed, and they do not have the convenience of returning to their country. It can be seen that on the issue of overseas Chinese between China and Japan, it is not the Japanese overseas Chinese issue that should be negotiated and resolved, but the Chinese overseas Chinese issue.
    Regarding the issue of Japanese war criminals. We have already said that we are prepared to handle them in accordance with a lenient policy. In August 1954, we had already exempted 417 former Japanese soldiers who had committed various crimes in the war of aggression against China and in the Chinese People's Liberation War from punishment and sent them back to Japan. Later, the Chinese Red Cross Society notified the Japanese Red Cross Society of the list and situation of 1,069 war criminals. The government of the People's Republic of China will handle these war criminals in accordance with Chinese legal procedures, which is a matter of Chinese sovereignty, and the Japanese government has no right to interfere.
    Apart from the above-mentioned Japanese overseas Chinese and Japanese war criminals, we do not have any Japanese people here whose situation is unclear. However, it is surprising that the Japanese government has raised the so-called issue of 40,000 people whose situation is unclear. Japanese militarists once drove a large number of Japanese people to participate in the war of aggression against China. Many Japanese people died in China during this war, and the Japanese government has not yet notified their relatives of the exact news of some of their deaths. It is natural and worthy of sympathy for their relatives to be concerned about their whereabouts. Based on humanitarian principles, the Chinese Red Cross Society once reached an agreement with the Japanese Red Cross Society and other groups on the issue of investigating the whereabouts of individual Japanese people, that is, if the Japanese Red Cross Society can provide specific materials, the Chinese Red Cross Society is willing to investigate as much as possible. However, it should be pointed out that this is a manifestation of the Chinese people's friendship towards the Japanese people, and has nothing to do with the Japanese government's insistence that there are still 40,000 people whose situation is unclear on the mainland of China. More importantly, during the war of aggression against China, Japanese militarists caused the massacre of more than tens of millions of Chinese people, and the loss of millions of U.S. dollars of Chinese public and private property, and abducted tens of thousands of Chinese people to Japan to be enslaved and killed. The Japanese government should understand that the Chinese people have the right to demand compensation for the enormous losses they have suffered. Now the Japanese government not only has not made any explanation for these situations, but also groundlessly demands that China explain the so-called issue of 40,000 people. This cannot but make people suspect the motives of the Japanese government in raising this issue.
    Promoting the normalization of relations between China and Japan on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for independence and sovereignty, in order to achieve peace and friendship between China and Japan, is the common aspiration of the people of China and Japan. For more than two years, the Chinese government has repeatedly taken steps to promote the normalization of relations between China and Japan. So far, the Japanese government has not only failed to make corresponding efforts, but also wants to use the issue of Japanese overseas Chinese returning to their country to divert public opinion in order to cover up its passivity in promoting the normalization of relations between China and Japan. In fact, the issue of Japanese overseas Chinese returning to their country has long been properly resolved by Chinese and Japanese people's organizations. Even if there are still matters that need to be further handled on this issue, they can only be matters of a business nature. But today there are indeed many important issues between China and Japan that concern the interests of the people of both countries. For example, developing normal trade between China and Japan, promoting mutual exchanges between the people of China and Japan, and properly handling the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese in China and Japan are all issues that need to be resolved by the governments of China and Japan. If the Japanese government is truly sincere in seeking a way to normalize relations between China and Japan, it should start with these issues. The Chinese government is prepared to negotiate with the Japanese government on these issues.
                    August 16, 1955
     Appendix: Public Statement of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs
    Regarding the issue of withdrawing Japanese remaining in mainland China, negotiations have been conducted by the Japanese Red Cross Society and two other organizations with the Chinese Red Cross Society. In eleven collective repatriations, approximately 29,000 people have been sent back. According to the Japanese government's investigation, there are still approximately 6,000 people who have not returned. There are also 1,069 people who are serving sentences as war criminals. A total of approximately 7,000 people remain in mainland China. In addition, there are approximately 40,000 people who previously stayed in mainland China and whose current situation is unknown.
    Since the visit of the Chinese Red Cross Society to Japan last November, more than 2,000 people have returned as promised. However, since the dispatch of ships to pick up overseas Chinese in March of this year, the issue of withdrawing overseas Chinese has made no progress.
    The so-called war criminals who are expected to be released soon have not been repatriated. Approximately 6,000 people are indeed still in China, and some of them also hope to return to their country but cannot. There are also many people whose whereabouts have been unknown for a long time after the war. Regarding these people, no information or news has been provided by the Chinese side.
    Regarding these issues, the Japanese Red Cross Society and other organizations have been in constant contact with the Chinese Red Cross Society. We hope that the government of the People's Republic of China will take sincere measures in accordance with humanitarian principles to promote this work. Our country has instructed our Consul General in Geneva to convey the Japanese side's wishes to the representative of the Consul General of the People's Republic of China in Geneva on the 15th, to be conveyed to the government of their country.
    Japan does not recognize the People's Republic of China, and there are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries, but this matter is related to humanitarian issues, so regardless of whether there are diplomatic relations, the authorities of the People's Republic of China should consider realizing our wishes.

### 就日本政府提出所谓撤退留在我国大陆的日本人问题  我国外交部发言人发表声明

    就日本政府提出所谓撤退留在我国大陆的日本人问题
    我国外交部发言人发表声明
    本报讯　中华人民共和国外交部发言人声明。全文如下：
    一九五五年七月十五日日本驻日内瓦总领事代表日本政府就所谓“遣返日本国民的要求”，交给中华人民共和国驻日内瓦总领事照会一件。七月十六日日本外务省又就所谓“撤退留在中国大陆的日本人问题”发表了一项公报。在照会和公报中，日本政府提出了毫无根据的指责和片面的无理的要求。对此，外交部发言人发表声明如下：
    首先说到侨民问题。中华人民共和国政府对愿意回国的在华日本侨民一向是给予各种便利的。到一九五五年三月底为止，经过中国红十字会同日本红十字会、日本中国友好协会、日本和平联络会的共同努力，在原有总数约三万五千名日侨中，已有约二万九千名愿意回国的日侨返回日本。现在仍然居留中国的有六千多名日侨，他们表示愿意长期或暂时侨居中国。如果他们中间有人改变意图，申请回国，中国政府仍将给予各种便利，中国红十字会亦将尽力协助。这一点当中国红十字会代表团访问日本时，曾经同日本红十字会等团体达成协议。现在日本政府竟提出所谓“撤侨问题再没有进展”的指责，这是毫无根据的。相反的，中国在日本有数万侨民，他们的正当权益并未得到应有的照顾。他们同祖国和家庭的联系还受着阻挠，他们更没有回国的便利。可见在中日两国侨民问题上，应该谈判解决的并不是日本侨民问题，倒是中国侨民问题。
    关于日本战犯问题。我们早已说过准备按照宽大政策进行处理。在一九五四年八月，我们已经将四百十七名在日本侵华战争中和在中国人民解放战争中犯有各种罪行的前日本军人免予惩处，送回日本。以后，中国红十字会又将一千零六十九人的战犯名单和情况通知了日本红十字会。对于这些战犯，中华人民共和国政府将按照中国的法律程序进行处理，这是属于中国主权的事情，日本政府无权过问。
    除了上述的日本侨民和日本战犯外，我们这里并没有什么情况不明的日本人。但是，日本政府竟然提出所谓情况不明的四万人问题，这是不能不令人诧异的。日本军国主义者曾经驱使大批日本人参加侵略中国的战争，在这个战争中死亡在中国的日本人很多，其中有些人的死亡确息或者日本政府至今尚未通知其亲属。他们的亲属关怀他们的下落是很自然的，值得同情。中国红十字会根据人道原则，曾经就调查个别日本人的下落问题同日本红十字会等团体达成一项协议，即如果日本红十字会能提出具体材料，中国红十字会愿意尽可能地予以调查。但应指出，这是中国人民对日本人民友好的表现，同日本政府硬说在中国大陆上还有所谓情况不明的四万人的问题毫无关系。更重要的是日本军国主义者在侵略中国的战争期间，曾经使千万以上的中国人民遭受屠杀，数百万万美元的中国公私财产遭受损失，并曾经将成千成万的中国人掳到日本去，加以奴役和杀害。日本政府应该了解，中国人民对于他们遭受的巨大损失，有权要求赔偿。现在日本政府不仅对于这些情况没有做过任何交代，而且无中生有地要求中国交代所谓四万人的问题，这不能不令人怀疑日本政府提出这个问题的动机。
    在平等互利、互相尊重独立和主权的基础上，促进中日两国关系的正常化，以实现中日两国的和平友好，是中日两国人民的共同愿望。两年多以来，中国政府已经一再采取了促进中日关系正常化的步骤，日本政府至今不但没有作出相应的努力，反而想利用日本侨民回国的问题，转移舆论的注意，以掩盖它对促进中日两国关系正常化的消极。其实，日本侨民回国问题早已经由中日两国人民团体妥善地解决了。在这个问题上，即使还有需要继续处理的事项，那也只能是事务性的问题。而今天在中日两国之间倒确实存在着许多有关两国人民利益的重大问题。例如，发展中日两国的正常贸易，促进中日两国人民的互相往来，妥善处理中日两国侨民的正当权益，这些都是需要中日两国政府来解决的问题。如果日本政府真正具有诚意来寻求中日两国关系正常化的途径，就应该从这些问题着手。中国政府是准备就这些问题同日本政府进行谈判的。
                    一九五五年八月十六日
     附：日本外务省公报
    关于撤退留在中国大陆的日本人问题，一向由日本红十字会和其他两个团体同中国红十字会进行谈判，前后十一次集体回国，共约送回二万九千人。根据日本政府的调查，大约还有六千人没有回国。还有被当做战犯正在服刑的人一千零六十九人。共计还有七千人留在中国大陆。此外，还有以前曾留在中国大陆，而现在情况不明的人约四万人。
    去年十一月，中国红十字会代表访日以后，按照他们的诺言，又有二千多人已经回国。但是自从今年三月派船接侨回去以后，撤侨问题再没有进展。
    估计不久就可以获得释放的所谓战犯都没有实现遣返。确实还留在中国的人约六千人，其中也有希望回国而不能回来的人。还有战后长期不知下落的人很多。关于这些人，都没有得到中国方面提供的情况和消息。
    关于这些问题，一向是由日本红十字会等团体同中国红十字会不断联系，我们希望中华人民共和国政府按照人道的观点，采取有诚意的措施，以促进这项工作。我国已命我国的总领事于十五日在日内瓦向中华人民共和国驻日内瓦的总领事代表要求把日方的希望传达给本国政府。
    日本没有承认中华人民共和国，两国之间没有正式的邦交关系，但是这种事情是有关人道的问题，所以不论有没有邦交关系，中华人民共和国当局都应该考虑实现我方希望的问题。
