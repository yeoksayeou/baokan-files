Joyful Wujiang River
Huang Zhenzu

The Wujiang River, known as a "natural barrier," has rapid currents, numerous dangerous shoals, and hidden reefs, including the famous Nine Shoals and Thirteen Gorges, and the sixty-kilometer-long Dragon Gate Gorge. Before liberation, due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' long-term neglect of towpath repairs and lack of management of dangerous shoals and hidden reefs, accidents such as towmen and boat people falling and getting injured, and boats hitting reefs and running into trouble occurred frequently. The Wujiang River became a river of terror and misery in people's minds.

After liberation, the People's Government carried out large-scale repairs to the Wujiang River's waterways and towpaths. After the repairs, wooden sailboats could travel unhindered from Sinan, Guizhou, to Fuling, Sichuan, and the danger to the lives of boatmen and boat people was also eliminated. Steamboats have also been successfully test-sailed on the six-hundred-li waterway from Gongtan, Youyang, on the border of Sichuan and Guizhou, to Fuling. From Pengshui to Fuling, steamboats often carry passengers and goods back and forth.

The Wujiang River is more than 1,000 kilometers long and passes through sixteen counties in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces. The areas along the river are rich in products. The upper reaches of the Wujiang River have countless mineral deposits such as copper, lead, iron and alum earth; the banks of the Wujiang River are rich in rice and corn; the area where Sichuan and Guizhou meet in the lower reaches of the Wujiang River is an important tung oil production area in China. There are also abundant native and special products such as wood oil, gallnut, medicinal materials, lacquer, wax, and green ramie; Fuling County, where the Wujiang River and the Yangtze River meet, is known as the "Home of Pickled Mustard Tuber." These abundant products mostly rely on the Wujiang River for transportation. From 1953 to May 1955, more than 17,900 tons of tung oil and more than 3,600 tons of wood oil were shipped from the Wujiang River. From 1954 to May 1955, the state transported more than 17,000 tons of salt to the people along the river via the Wujiang River alone. Thanks to the boatmen's labor competitions and the study of Soviet shipping experience, the carrying capacity of ships has increased, the sailing speed has accelerated, and transportation prices have been reduced compared to the past. Now, transporting one ton of general cargo from Gongtan, Youyang, to Fuling costs half as much as it used to. In remote mountainous areas—Mugen Township, Wulong County—farmers used to not be able to buy salt with corn, or had to spend five sheng of corn to buy one jin of salt. Now, large quantities of salt have been transported to the mountainous areas, and one sheng of corn can buy one jin of salt. Last year, freight rates in Gongtan, Youyang, were reduced by 11.65 percent, and the local farmers' local and special products were sold at good prices, and the department stores, cloth, and other daily necessities they bought were very cheap. Many farmers said: "The Wujiang River has been repaired, and we don't have to worry about not being able to sell our things for money, and we don't have to worry about not being able to buy things with money!"

In the past, the boatmen, boat people, and farmers along the river lacked food and clothing, were beaten and scolded, and lived a life worse than cattle and horses. Now it's different! Most of the boatmen and boat people are wearing new clothes, and some even wear watches. The wooden boat workers in Fuling County have also built two new dormitories outside the county seat. In their spare time from work, they often play basketball, watch movies, and read many kinds of books, newspapers, and magazines, and learning culture is gradually becoming a trend. The boatmen all say: This is going from "hell" to "heaven." The young worker Shi Yuxiao herded cattle for landlords when he was seven or eight years old, and came to the Wujiang River to pull boats for bosses at the age of twelve. At that time, he lived a life of bare feet and naked body. After liberation, under the cultivation and education of the Party, he became a model worker and became a pilot on a steamship. When I visited him, he was wearing a fine khaki sailor's uniform, yellow leather shoes, and said with a smile: "If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao coming and leading us to cure the Wujiang River, I, Shi Yuxiao, would not have such a good life today!"

The remote mountain villages along the Wujiang River have also undergone great changes. Take Xiannv Mountain, which is eighty li away from Wulong County, as an example. In the past, animal plagues and floods continued one after another, and there were nine years of crop failure out of ten years. Every family lived by digging bracken roots and picking jade hairpin flowers. Many farmers were unwilling to live in the mountains. During the land reform, eleven farmers went down the mountain to cultivate fields on the plains. Under the leadership of the Party, the farmers in this mountain established mutual aid organizations for production in 1953 and established a hunting team. Animal plagues have decreased year by year, and grain output has increased a lot compared with before liberation. Thanks to the state's vigorous purchase of medicinal materials and other local and special products produced in the mountains, each household can increase their sideline income by about thirty yuan a year. In 1954, one village on Xiannv Mountain sold more than 17,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. During the New Year, every family made new clothes. The farmers all said: The People's Government has only been established for a few years, and our poor mountain slope has become a rich mountain slope! Seeing these changes, some of the farmers who had moved down the mountain have also returned to the mountain. Originally, many of the girls on Xiannv Mountain wanted to find partners down the mountain. Now, the girls see that there are the same prospects both on and off the mountain, and the idea of going down the mountain has generally been dispelled. With the advancement of socialist construction, the banks of the Wujiang River will become even more prosperous and beautiful!

    欢乐的乌江
    黄振祖
    号称“天险”的乌江，水流湍急，滩险众多，暗礁密布，有著名的九埝十三峡和长达六十公里的龙门峡。解放以前，由于国民党反动派长期不整修纤道，不治理滩险暗礁，拉纤船工和船民摔死摔伤，行船触礁遇难等事故不断发生。乌江成为人们心目中的一条恐怖、悲惨的河流。
    解放以后，人民政府对乌江的航道和纤道进行了大规模的整修。整修过的乌江，木帆船从贵州思南到四川涪陵可以畅行无阻，船工船民们生命的危险也消除了。从四川贵州交界的酉阳龚滩到涪陵的六百里航道，轮船也试航成功。从彭水到涪陵，轮船已经常常载着乘客和货物来来往往。
    乌江全长一千多公里，经过四川、贵州两省的十六个县。沿岸各地物产丰富。乌江上游，有无数的铜、铅、铁矾土等矿藏；乌江两岸，盛产稻米和玉米；乌江下游四川贵州交界地带，是我国重要的桐油产地，这里还有丰富的木油、五倍子、药材、漆、蜡、青麻等大宗土、特产品；乌江和长江会合处的涪陵县，有“榨菜之家”的称号。这些丰富的物产大都依靠乌江来运输。一九五三年到一九五五年五月，从乌江运出的桐油有一万七千九百多吨，木油有三千六百多吨。一九五四年到一九五五年五月，国家仅经过乌江运给沿岸人民的盐巴就有一万七千多吨。由于船工们开展了劳动竞赛，学习了苏联航运经验，船只载重量提高，航行速度加快，运价比以前降低。现在从酉阳龚滩到涪陵运一吨杂货，运价比过去低一半。在僻远的高山地区——武隆县木根乡，农民们过去有玉米买不到盐巴，或者要花五升玉米才能买到一斤盐巴。现在，盐巴大批运到了高山地区，一升玉米就能买到一斤盐巴。去年，酉阳龚滩货物运价降低了百分之十一点六五，当地农民的土、特产卖上了好价钱，买到的百货、布匹和其他日用品又很便宜。许多农民说：“乌江修好了，我们有东西不愁卖不到钱，有了钱也不愁买不到东西啦！”
    过去沿江的船工、船民和农民们缺吃少穿，挨打受骂，过着牛马不如的生活。现在不同啦！船工、船民多数人都穿上了新衣服，有的还戴上了手表。涪陵县的木船工人们还在县城外修了两幢新宿舍。工作余暇，他们还常打篮球、看电影，阅读许多种书报杂志，学文化渐渐成了风气。船工们都说：这是从“地狱”走上了“天堂”。年青的工人石玉小，七、八岁时给地主放过牛，十二岁来到乌江给老板拉船。那时候，他过的是光身赤脚的日子。解放以后，在党的培养教育下，他成了劳动模范，当上了轮船上的引水员。当我访问他的时候，他穿着细卡其海员工人的服装、黄色的皮鞋，满脸笑容地说：“要不是共产党和毛主席来了，领导我们治好了乌江，我石玉小那有今天这样的好日子！”
    乌江沿岸僻远的山村也起了很大变化。拿离武隆县城八十里地的仙女山为例。过去，这里兽害、水涝接连不断，十年九不收，家家靠挖蕨根和采玉簪花过日子。很多农民不愿意在山里居住，土地改革时，还有十一家农民下山到平坝上种田。在党的领导下，这座山里的农民在一九五三年建立了生产互助组织，成立了打猎队。兽害年年减少，粮食产量比解放以前增加很多。由于国家大力收购山上出产的药材等土、特产品，每家一年都能增加约三十元的副业收入。一九五四年，仙女山一个村庄就卖给国家一万七千多斤余粮。过年的时候，家家还都缝制了新衣服。农民们都说：人民政府成立才短短几年，我们穷山坡就变成富山坡啦！看到这些变化，原来搬下山的农民，有的也回到山上来了。原来仙女山的姑娘们，许多都想在山下找对象。现在，姑娘们看到山上山下都一样有前途，下山的念头一般都打消了。随着社会主义建设的前进，乌江两岸将会变得更加富裕和美丽！
