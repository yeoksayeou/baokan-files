Agricultural machinery stations in various regions have achieved widespread bumper harvests of wheat by plowing for agricultural production cooperatives and state farms. According to information from thirteen agricultural machinery stations in Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Anhui, Beijing, and other regions, in the autumn of 1954, they plowed over 27,500 mu of winter wheat for more than fifty agricultural production cooperatives and more than ten state farms. This summer harvest generally saw an increase of about 40% compared to wheat grown on land tilled by livestock in the same area, with the highest increase reaching more than double. In Shandong's Tai'an station, despite widespread yield reduction due to drought, the 151 mu of wheat that was mechanically plowed and sown still yielded 230 jin per mu, a 56% increase compared to livestock-tilled land.

The masses near various stations, seeing the significant yield increase in mechanically cultivated land, have been requesting plowing services. The Yuci station already has five agricultural production cooperatives requesting to sign mechanized farming contracts with them. (Zhang Shijue)

　  农业机器站机耕小麦丰收
    各地农业机器站替农业生产合作社和国营农场耕种小麦普遍获得丰产。据山西、河北、山东、河南、陕西、安徽、北京等地的十三个农业机器站了解，一九五四年秋季共为五十余个农业生产合作社、十多个国营农场机耕冬小麦二万七千五百多亩，今年夏收一般比当地畜耕地小麦增产百分之四十左右，最高的增产达一倍多。山东泰安站在天旱普遍减收情况下，机耕机播一百五十一亩的小麦，每亩尚收二三○斤，比畜耕地尚增产百分之五十六。
    各站附近群众看到机耕地小麦显著增产，纷纷要求代耕。榆次站已有五个农业生产合作社要求和他们订机耕合同。（张世珏）
