Construction of Bayingolin Oil Mill Begins in Xinjiang Province

　　Xinjiang Province is beginning construction on a locally state-owned Bayingolin Oil Mill.

　　Bayingolin is a famous oilseed producing area in Xinjiang Province, with oilseed crops accounting for 10 percent of the province's total oilseed crop area. However, oil extraction there has always been done using traditional methods, resulting in low oil yields and significant waste, far from meeting demand. The Bayingolin Oil Mill under construction will use machinery for production from feeding to oil extraction. The factory will have light rail tracks laid, and workers can use trolleys to transport raw materials from the warehouse to the raw material pool. The extracted oil can be pumped into the warehouse. The factory will have good fire protection and insulation equipment. Once this factory is completed and put into production, the oil yield can reach 31 percent. The equipment also takes into account future development needs, and the production capacity can be further increased by 50 percent with the addition of some machinery and equipment.

　  新疆省动工建设拜城榨油厂
    新疆省正在动工建设一座地方国营的拜城榨油厂。
    拜城是新疆省的著名油料产地，油料作物面积占全省油料作物面积的百分之十。但那里榨油向来全用土法，出油率低，浪费大，远不能满足需要。这个正在建设的拜城榨油厂，从加料到出油都将用机器生产。厂内铺有轻便铁道，工人们用推车可以把原料由仓库送到原料池，榨成的油可用泵抽入仓库。厂里将有良好的消防和保温设备。这个厂建成并投入生产后，出油率可达百分之三十一。在设备方面还考虑到将来发展的需要，只要增加一部分机器设备，生产能力就可进一步提高百分之五十。
