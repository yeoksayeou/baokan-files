Xinhua News Agency, 21st. This reporter reports: Dr. Du Lianyao, a Chinese student who recently returned from the United States, told this reporter that the US Immigration and Naturalization Service deliberately delayed processing applications for passport visa extensions for Chinese students in the United States in order to persecute and threaten those who wanted to return to China.

Du Lianyao went to the United States in August 1948. He originally planned to return to China in early 1952 after obtaining a doctorate in physics from the University of Pennsylvania, but the US government did not allow him to realize his wish until June of this year.

Du Lianyao, who had been separated from his wife and four children in Beijing for seven years, described to the reporter at his home the persecution and obstruction he suffered when he went through the procedures to return to China in early 1952. At that time, the US Immigration Bureau arrested him and imprisoned him in the Pittsburgh city jail on the pretext that his passport visa had expired. In fact, Du Lianyao had applied to the Immigration Bureau for an extension of his passport visa as early as 1950, a year and a half earlier, but the Immigration Bureau never processed it. It wasn't until Du Lianyao had begun preparing for his graduation exams and was about to return to China that the Immigration Bureau used its own delay as a crime to accuse Du Lianyao. Du Lianyao was imprisoned for three days, and was later released on bail after his Chinese classmates at the school raised $2,000. He was subjected to all kinds of insults in prison.

After this incident, Du Lianyao said, "Many Chinese students in the United States, for fear of suffering the same persecution, no longer dared to publicly express their desire to return to China."

Du Lianyao filed a complaint with the US Immigration Bureau for the illegal persecution he suffered, but the US Immigration Bureau, in turn, used his "sympathy" for his own government as an excuse in June 1952 to order his deportation. When Du Lianyao said that he would rather be deported, the US Immigration Bureau shirked responsibility again, saying that there were no diplomatic relations between China and the United States, and this order would not be carried out for the time being, and he was still forced to continue to stay in the United States.

In the summer of 1953, Du Lianyao received two contradictory orders from the US Immigration Bureau within a short period of ten days. The first order was issued by the highest Immigration Bureau in Washington, which revoked the previous deportation order against Du Lianyao and ordered him to leave the United States within sixty days. However, the second order issued by the Pittsburgh Immigration Bureau warned him not to leave the United States, otherwise he would be sentenced to five years in prison or a fine of $5,000, or both.

When Du Lianyao went to the Pittsburgh Immigration Bureau to question which order was valid, the person in charge of the bureau argued sophistically that the second order was valid, and after admitting that he was "unreasonable" and "had no reason," he still refused to return Du Lianyao's previous $2,000 deposit, even though the highest Immigration Bureau's order clearly stated that the previous deportation order had been revoked.

Now back in China, Du Lianyao told reporters that he hoped that the Sino-US ambassadorial talks currently being held in Geneva could reach an agreement so that all Chinese students in the United States would have the freedom to return to China.

　　杜连耀叙述美国移民局阻挠他回国的情形
    新华社二十一日讯　本社记者报道：不久前回国的中国留美学生杜连耀博士向本社记者谈到美国移民和归化局故意拖延不理留美中国学生护照签证延期的申请，来迫害和威胁想回国的留美学生。
    杜连耀是在一九四八年八月去美国的。他预定在一九五二年初获得宾夕法尼亚大学物理学博士的学位以后，就回到祖国来，但是美国政府直到今年六月才允许他实现自己的愿望。
    离别自己在北京的妻子和四个孩子已七年之久的杜连耀在自己的家里对记者叙述了他本人在一九五二年初办理回国手续时所遭受到的迫害和阻挠。当时，美国移民局借口他的护照签证过期，把他逮捕并且关进了匹兹堡城的监狱。事实上，杜连耀早在一九五○年，即一年半以前，就已经向移民局申请延长护照签证，然而移民局始终不予办理。一直到杜连耀已开始准备毕业考试，眼看就要回国的时候，移民局却把自己的拖延算作杜连耀的罪状来控告杜连耀。杜连耀在监狱里关了三天，后来，经过学校的中国同学筹措了两千美元作保才获释出狱。在狱中，他受到了种种侮辱。
    在这件事发生以后，杜连耀说，“很多留美的中国学生为了怕受同样的迫害，就不敢再公开表示要回国了。”
    杜连耀为自己所受到的非法迫害向美国移民局提出了控诉，但是美国移民局却反而在一九五二年六月以他“同情”自己的政府为借口，判决把他驱逐出境。当杜连耀表示宁愿被驱逐出境时，美移民局却又推诿中美两国没有邦交，这项命令暂不执行，仍然强迫他继续留在美国。
    一九五三年夏季，杜连耀先后在短短十几天里得到美国移民局两道互相矛盾的命令。第一道命令是华盛顿最高移民局所下的，它撤销了过去驱逐杜连耀出境的判决，命令他在六十天内离开美国。但是匹兹堡移民局所下的第二道命令却又警告他不准离开美国，否则要处以五年监禁或五千美元的罚款，或者同时受两种处罚。
    当杜连耀到匹兹堡移民局质询究竟那一道命令有效时，该局负责人强词夺理地说，第二道命令有效，并且在承认自己“不讲理”和“没有理由”以后，仍然拒绝发还杜连耀过去所缴的两千美元保证金，虽然最高移民局的命令中明明写着以前的驱逐出境的判决已经撤销了。
    现在回到祖国后的杜连耀对记者说，他希望目前在日内瓦举行的中美大使级会谈能达成协议，使所有的中国留美学生都有回国的自由。
