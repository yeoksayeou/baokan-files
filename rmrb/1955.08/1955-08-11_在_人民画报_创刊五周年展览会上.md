At the Fifth Anniversary Exhibition of "People's Pictorial"
    Xie Xuecun

    Currently, "People's Pictorial" is holding a fifth anniversary exhibition.

    "People's Pictorial" is a comprehensive social and political monthly magazine that uses pictures and short texts to report on the construction of new China to domestic and foreign readers, as well as the changes in the spiritual outlook and material life of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups, and their contributions to the struggle for world peace. Since its founding in July 1950, it has grown stronger day by day with the help of central and local agencies and organizations, and with the love and support of its readers.

    The exhibition provides a brief introduction to this.

    Entering the exhibition, the first thing that strikes people is the colorful pictorial printed in various languages. When it was first published, "People's Pictorial" was only available in Chinese, but now it is printed in eleven languages: Chinese, Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, Korean, Russian, English, French, Japanese, Indonesian, and Spanish.

    Domestically, we can see "People's Pictorial" everywhere, whether in factories, farms, government offices, schools, or on trains, in reading rooms, or next to book stalls. The exhibition displays a world map, starting from Beijing, crossing national and continental boundaries, crossing mountains and oceans.

    Red lines extend outwards. These red lines lead to the great Soviet Union, and also to various capitalist countries; they lead to cold Iceland, and also to hot African countries. They enable our people to have more contact with the people of all countries in the world, and at the same time transmit the great voice of new China to the people of the whole world. These red lines are the direct distribution network of "People's Pictorial" abroad, which covers seventy-two countries and regions.

    This pictorial, which sells all over the world, has been widely welcomed and supported by readers. Domestic readers regard it as a textbook for educating and encouraging themselves. Many readers provide it with information and reporting clues, and assist its editors in their work. Abroad, Mr. Qingshu of the Japan Reader Center gave "People's Pictorial" to more than one hundred workers to read, and then posted it on billboards so that the whole village could see it. Italian reader Gesbi is a small vendor, he put "People's Pictorial" on his truck, "so that people can see the miracle of socialist construction in new China."

    The "People's Pictorial" editorial department receives an average of 300 letters from readers every month. The letter writers include workers, farmers, nannies, pastors, sailors, fishermen, housewives, clerks, monks, as well as people from all walks of life, including political, literary, news publishing, science and technology, and medical and health. Among them are members of the World Peace Council, Mrs. Felton of England, famous Indonesian poets, Chairman of the Indonesian People's Cultural Association Tarda, and Japanese painter and Stalin Prize winner Toshiko Akamatsu and other famous people. In their letters, readers expressed their infinite love and longing for the People's Pictorial and the great new China. Naval warrior Qi Wenzong, a domestic reader, said that "People's Pictorial" made him feel even more the greatness and loveliness of the motherland, and he is determined to be ready to eliminate any enemies who dare to invade at any time and anywhere. Etienne from France wrote in a letter: "I am very satisfied with the content of your magazine... I was deeply moved when I saw the huge changes in the Chinese countryside, which geography books say is 'unchanged for generations'." Japanese Akamatsu Toshiko wrote in a letter: "'People's Pictorial' is getting better and better, and I look forward to the progress of new China with surprise and joy."

    The March issue of "People's Pictorial" published a group of materials titled "Traditional Chinese Medicine," and after this issue was distributed abroad, countless enthusiastic letters followed from India, the Soviet Union, Japan, Australia... These readers expressed great interest in China's traditional Chinese medicine and requested the editorial department to tell them some general knowledge about traditional Chinese medicine, which they planned to use to treat their own diseases.

    Enthusiastic foreign readers also continue to send New Year's cards, commemorative badges, photos and other gifts to the "People's Pictorial" editorial department. Here is a photo from a reader in Tokyo, Japan: it is raining, and a large group of people are holding umbrellas and lining up to enter a hall. This is the scene of them attending the second "People's Pictorial" reader symposium.

    The exhibition displayed some foreign newspapers and periodicals: the "Canadian Forum" and many Japanese newspapers and periodicals introduced the text of "People's Pictorial." The exhibition also displayed another part of foreign newspapers and periodicals, which are articles reprinted from "People's Pictorial" by newspapers and periodicals from the Soviet Union, Japan, Switzerland, Indonesia and other countries. Among them, the Indonesian "People's Daily" reprinted thirteen articles. "People's Pictorial" has become one of the best readings for foreign readers to understand and learn from new China.

    With the progress of new China, "People's Pictorial" has become more perfect in quality and has increased dramatically in quantity over the past five years. Now it has an average monthly circulation of 340,000 copies, an increase of seven and a half times compared with its initial publication.

    Just as all the colleagues of "People's Pictorial" are happily celebrating the fifth anniversary of the founding of "People's Pictorial" and expressing their intention to do a better job with greater efforts, the pictorial editorial department has received many congratulatory telegrams and letters from home and abroad. The congratulatory telegram from "Soviet Pictorial" said: "We sincerely hope that you will achieve new creative achievements in the noble cause of reporting the great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese government and the wise Communist Party."

    在“人民画报”创刊五周年展览会上
    谢雪村
    目前，“人民画报”正在举办着一个创刊五周年展览会。
    “人民画报”是综合性的社会政治月刊，它用图片和简短的文字向国内外读者报道新中国的建设，报道中国各族人民精神面貌和物质生活的变化，以及他们在争取世界和平中的贡献。从一九五○年七月创刊以来，在中央和地方各机关团体的帮助下，在广大读者的爱护和支持下，它一天天的壮大。
    对此，展览会作了简要的介绍。
    走进展览会，首先使人注意的是绚烂多采的用各种文字印刷的画报。创刊时，“人民画报”只有汉文一种文字，现在已用汉、蒙、藏、维吾尔、朝鲜、俄、英、法、日、印度尼西亚、西班牙等十一种文字印刷了。
    在国内，我们到处可以看到“人民画报”，无论在工厂、农庄、机关、学校，也无论在火车上、阅览室中、书摊旁。展览会上挂着一张世界全图，从北京出发，跨过国界和洲界，跨过高山和海洋，
    一条条红线引出去。这些红线引向伟大的苏联，也引向各资本主义国家；引向寒冷的冰岛，也引向炎热的非洲诸国。它们使我国人民同世界各国人民取得了更多的联系，同时使新中国的伟大声音更多地传达给全世界人民。这些红线是“人民画报”国外的直接发行网，它遍布于七十二个国家和地区。
    这个行销全世界的画报受到了读者广泛的欢迎和支持。国内读者把它当作教育和鼓舞自己的课本。许多读者为它提供情况和报道线索，协助它的编辑人员工作。在国外，日本读者中心清秀将“人民画报”送给一百多位劳动者看后，又将它贴在广告牌上，好让全村人都看到。意大利读者盖斯比是一位小贩，他把“人民画报”放在货车上，“好叫人看到新中国社会主义建设的奇迹。”
    “人民画报”编辑部平均每月要收到三百封读者来信。来信者包括工人、农民、褓姆、牧师、海员、渔民、家庭妇女、职员、僧侣以及政治、文艺、新闻出版、科学技术、医药卫生等各界人士。其中有世界和平理事会常务委员、英国费尔顿夫人、印度尼西亚著名诗人、印度尼西亚人民文协主席塔尔达以及日本画家、斯大林奖金获得者赤松俊子等著名人士。读者在来信中对人民画报和伟大的新中国表现了无限的热爱和向往。国内读者海军战士齐文宗说，“人民画报”使他进一步感到祖国的伟大和可爱，他决心准备着，随时随地消灭胆敢前来侵犯的敌人。法国埃替昂来信说：“你们的杂志内容很使我满意，……当看到地理书上所说‘万代不变’的中国农村起了巨大的变化时，我深深地受到了感动”。日本赤松俊子信中说：“‘人民画报’一期比一期好，使我怀着惊异和喜悦的心情展望着新中国的进步。”
    今年三月号的“人民画报”上登载过一组题名“中医中药”的材料，这期画报发行到国外以后，紧接着就有无数的热情的信从印度、苏联、日本、澳大利亚……寄来，这些读者一方面表示对于我国的中医和中药充满着极大兴趣，另一方面也要求编辑部告诉他们一些关于中医和中药的一般知识，他们预备用来治疗自己的疾病。
    热情的国外读者还不断把贺年片、纪念章、照片等礼品寄到“人民画报”编辑部来。这里有一张日本东京读者寄来的照片：天下着雨，一大群人撑着伞排队进入一间大厅。这是他们去参加“人民画报”第二次读者座谈会的情形。
    展览会陈列了一部分外文报刊：“加拿大论坛报”和日本许多报刊介绍“人民画报”的文字。展览会上还陈列了另一部分外文报刊，这就是苏联、日本、瑞士、印度尼西亚等国报刊转载“人民画报”的文章。其中陈列的印度尼西亚“人民日报”转载的就有十三篇。“人民画报”已成了国外读者了解新中国并向它学习的最好读物之一。
    随着新中国的前进，五年来“人民画报”在质量上日趋完美，在数量上则是飞跃上升。现在它每月平均发行三十四万册，比创刊时增加了七倍半。
    正当“人民画报”全体工作同志欢欣地庆祝“人民画报”创刊五周年，并表示将用更大的努力办好它的时候，画报编辑部接到了许多来自国内外的贺电贺信。“苏联画报”的贺电说：“衷心希望你们在报道中国人民在中国政府和英明的共产党领导下所取得的伟大成就的高贵事业中，获得新的创造性的成就。”
