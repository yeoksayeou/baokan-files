Using Hot-Pressed Soybean Cake to Make Soy Sauce Can Save Soybeans

    Hu Hongji

    In the first half of 1954, with the close cooperation of the grain departments, the China Oils and Fats Company began to experiment with and promote the method of using hot-pressed soybean cake to make soy sauce. Currently, this method has been promoted in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, Beijing, Wuhan, and other places. It has also been successfully tested in Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi, Fujian, Guangxi, and other provinces and is being gradually promoted.

    In the past, most areas of our country were accustomed to using soybeans as the raw material for making soy sauce, and the number of soybeans used for soy sauce across the country each year was very large. According to incomplete statistics, the amount of soybeans used for soy sauce in various places is: Tianjin requires an average of more than 18 tons per 10,000 people per year, Nanjing requires an average of more than 16 tons per 10,000 people, Zhenjiang requires an average of more than 20 tons per 10,000 people, and Taiyuan requires an average of more than 14 tons per 10,000 people. Due to the promotion of the advanced experience of using hot-pressed soybean cake to make soy sauce, soybeans have been saved. According to incomplete statistics, various places have increased oil production by more than 2,200 tons in 1954 and the first quarter of 1955 alone. If this advanced experience is promoted in cities above the county level across the country, calculating 15 tons of soybeans used for soy sauce per 10,000 people per year, approximately 90,000 tons of soybeans can be saved. Assuming an average oil yield of 12 percent for soybeans, this would increase soybean oil production by 10,800 tons.

    The soy sauce made from hot-pressed soybean cake has been tested and verified by the health departments, and the quality is the same as that of soy sauce made from soybeans. This is because soy sauce production only requires the protein and starch in soybeans, not the fat. The delicious taste of soy sauce is mainly due to the action of amino acids, which are produced from protein. The protein content of soybean cake is no lower than the protein content of soybeans, so using soybean cake to make soy sauce will not affect the quality of the soy sauce.

    The method of using hot-pressed soybean cake to make soy sauce is very simple. The manufacturing process is the same as the manufacturing process using soybeans, and no additional equipment is required. Because soybean cake is inexpensive, using soybean cake as a raw material can greatly reduce the cost of soy sauce.

    In order to do this work well, the grain departments and oils and fats companies in various places should, under the leadership of the local people's committees, cooperate with industrial, cooperative, and other relevant departments to first hand over the soybeans originally planned by the grain departments to supply the soy sauce industry to the oils and fats company for processing and oil extraction, and then supply the soybean cake to the soy sauce industry. In areas where there are currently no conditions to adopt this method, active experimentation should also be carried out to create conditions for future promotion.

    用热榨豆饼制酱油，能节约大豆
    胡宏勣
    一九五四年上半年，中国油脂公司在粮食部门的密切配合下，开始试验推行热榨豆饼制造酱油的方法。目前，这个方法已在上海、浙江、江苏、山东、北京、武汉等地推行；在山西、河北、河南、安徽、江西、四川、甘肃、陕西、福建、广西等省也都试验成功，正在逐步推广。
    过去我国大部分地区都习惯用大豆做制造酱油的原料，全国每年用作酱油的大豆数量非常大。根据不完全的统计，各地用作酱油的大豆：天津市每一万人平均每年需用十八吨多，南京每一万人平均需用十六吨多，镇江每一万人平均需用二十吨多，太原每一万人平均需用十四吨多。由于推广了热榨豆饼做酱油的先进经验节省了大豆，据不完全的统计，各地仅一九五四年和一九五五年第一季度就增产了油品二千二百多吨。如果在全国县城以上的城市推广这个先进经验，每一万人每年用作酱油的大豆以十五吨计算，共可节约大豆九万吨左右。大豆的出油率平均以百分之十二计算，即可增产豆油一万零八百吨。
    利用热榨豆饼所制的酱油经卫生部门化验证实，质量和大豆所制酱油相同。因为制造酱油只需要黄豆中的蛋白质和淀粉，并不需要脂肪；酱油的味道鲜美，主要是氨基酸的作用，而氨基酸是从蛋白质中产生的。豆饼中蛋白质的含量并不低于大豆中的含量，因此用豆饼做酱油也就不会影响酱油的质量。
    用热榨豆饼制酱油的方法很简单，制造过程和用大豆制造过程相同，也不需要增加设备。由于豆饼价格低廉，使用豆饼做原料可以大大降低酱油的成本。
    为了做好这项工作，各地粮食部门和油脂公司应当在当地人民委员会的领导下，配合工业、合作社等有关部门，把原粮食部门计划供应酱油业的大豆，先交油脂公司加工榨油，然后以豆饼供应酱油业。在目前尚无条件采用这种方法的地区，也应当积极进行试验，为将来推广创造条件。
