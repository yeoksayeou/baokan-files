Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 15th: The Fifth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship, held in Warsaw, closed on August 14th, according to the Polish Press Agency. More than 30,000 young people from 114 countries around the world participated in the festival, which lasted for fifteen days. The festival reviewed the strength and confidence of young people from all countries fighting to realize humanity's most lofty ideals—peace and friendship among nations.

　　At 9 p.m. on the 14th, the closing ceremony of the festival was held at Stalin Square in front of the Palace of Culture and Science in the center of Warsaw. Delegations of young people from various countries entered this huge square before the start of the closing ceremony. Tens of thousands of residents of Warsaw cheered and saluted them, throwing bouquets of flowers to these young men and women.

　　In the center of Stalin Square stood the delegations of the five major powers—the Soviet Union, the United States, China, Britain, and France. Next to them were the youth of other countries.

　　Standing on the platform of honor were the members of the International Preparatory Committee of the Festival, headed by Bernini, President of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and Chairman of the International Preparatory Committee of the Festival; Denis, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and Belyakov, Secretary-General of the International Union of Students, Jaworska, Chairman of the Central Council of the Polish Youth Union, as well as the heads of youth delegations from various countries and many distinguished guests participating in the festival.

　　Leaders of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish government, headed by Beirut, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, also attended the closing ceremony.

　　Jaworska, Chairman of the Central Council of the Polish Youth Union, first delivered a farewell speech at the closing ceremony. She said that after spending these exciting days of the festival together, each youth representative will return to their work posts with new strength and enthusiasm. She said that we all recognize that regardless of differences of opinion, a common language can be found among all those who sincerely desire peace. At the Warsaw Festival, the ideals of peace and friendship have triumphed. We will fight with greater enthusiasm in all countries to win new supporters and new masses of young people. She finally expressed the hope that young people from all countries will participate in the Sixth World Youth Festival in Moscow two years later with greater victories and achievements.

　　Bernini, President of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, then delivered a speech. He said: Having participated in this great festival, we are even more convinced that if all young people and their organizations cooperate together, then no force can stop the progress of the younger generation around the world. He said that when we leave Warsaw to return to our countries, we are willing to guarantee that we will go everywhere—to all countries and villages, schools and factories, among all young people and their organizations—to promote the lofty ideals of unity, cooperation, friendship, and peace that unite us here. Let us work together to enable the youth of all countries to contribute more fully than before to the great struggle of the peoples of all countries to ensure the victory of lasting peace and to create a future of happiness for all mankind!

　　Jaworska and Bernini's speeches were met with continuous cheers.

　　Bernini then read out the Letter to the Youth of All Countries. After reading it, prolonged and loud cheers rang out in the square. The words "Peace" and "Friendship" echoed in the square in many languages.

　　Then, the representatives of the youth of all countries lowered the flag of the Fifth World Youth Festival and sang the anthem of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. At this time, hundreds of fireworks rose into the sky. White and colorful lights formed a dome over Stalin Square, changing color every minute.

　　The closing ceremony of the Fifth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship ended in universal joy.

    第五届世界青年联欢节闭幕
    新华社华沙十五日电　据波兰通讯社报道，在华沙举行的第五届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节在八月十四日闭幕。这届联欢节一共举行了十五天，参加联欢节的有来自全世界一百一十四个国家的三万多个青年。联欢节检阅了各国青年为实现人类最崇高的理想——和平与各国之间的友谊——而斗争的力量和信心。
    十四日晚九时，联欢节在华沙市中心的斯大林文化科学宫前面的斯大林广场举行了闭幕式。各国青年代表团在闭幕式开始前进入了这个巨大的广场。华沙市成千上万的居民向他们欢呼致意，并且投给这些青年男女们一束束的鲜花。
    在斯大林广场的中央，站着五大国——苏联、美国、中国、英国和法国——的代表团。他们旁边是其他国家的青年。
    站在荣誉席上的有以世界民主青年联盟主席、联欢节的国际筹备委员会主席柏尼尼为首的联欢节的国际筹备委员会的委员们；世界民主青年联盟总书记德尼和国际学生联合会总书记贝利康，波兰青年联盟中央理事会主席雅沃尔斯卡以及各国青年代表团团长和许多参加联欢节的贵宾们。
    以波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记贝鲁特为首的波兰统一工人党和波兰政府的领导人员也参加了闭幕式。
    波兰青年联盟中央理事会主席雅沃尔斯卡首先在闭幕式上致告别词。她说，在一起度过联欢节这些激动人心的日子以后，每一个青年代表将带着新的力量和热情返回自己的工作岗位。她说，我们全都认识到，不管意见有什么分歧，凡是真诚渴望和平的人都是可以找到共同的语言的。在华沙的联欢节中，和平与友谊的理想已经取得胜利。我们将以更大的热情在各国为争取成千成万的新的支持者、新的青年群众而奋斗。她最后表示希望，各国青年将以更大的胜利和成绩参加两年后在莫斯科举行的第六届世界青年联欢节。
    世界民主青年联盟主席柏尼尼接着致词。他说：参加了这个伟大的联欢节，我们更加相信，如果所有青年人和他们的组织共同合作，那就没有任何力量能够阻止全世界青年一代的进步。他说，在离开华沙回国的时候，我们愿保证将到各地——一切国家和乡村、学校和工厂、一切青年中间和他们的组织中——去发扬在这里把我们联系在一起的崇高的团结、合作、友谊和和平的理想。让我们共同努力，使世界各国青年比以前更充分地对各国人民为保证持久和平的胜利和为创造全体人类幸福的未来的伟大斗争作出贡献吧！
    雅沃尔斯卡和柏尼尼的发言受到经久不息的欢呼。
    柏尼尼接着宣读了告各国青年书。读完以后，广场上响起了长时间的巨大欢呼声。广场上回响着用许多语言喊出的“和平”和“友谊”。
    接着，各国青年的代表都放低了第五届世界青年联欢节的旗帜，高唱世界民主青年联盟的盟歌。这时，成百个焰火升向天空。白色的和五彩的灯光在斯大林广场上组成一个穹顶，每分钟改变着颜色。
    第五届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的闭幕式在普遍的欢乐中结束。
