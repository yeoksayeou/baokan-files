    Many Automobile Drivers Pay Attention to Saving Gasoline
    State-owned motor transport companies in more than a dozen provinces, including Shandong, Xinjiang, Sichuan, and Anhui, have adopted many measures to save gasoline and diesel. After studying Dong Fengming's advanced experience in saving gasoline, drivers of various teams under the Transportation Bureau of the Xinjiang Provincial Department of Transportation saved a total of more than 76 tons of gasoline in April compared with March; in May, more than 80 percent of the vehicles in the bureau promoted Dong Fengming's advanced experience in saving fuel. At present, various teams are strengthening vehicle maintenance and improving technical operations, striving to complete the plan to save 1.4 tons of gasoline per vehicle for the country this year ahead of schedule.
    Drivers of various transportation companies under the Transportation Bureau of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Transportation have generally strengthened the technical maintenance of vehicles and improved driving methods, saving a total of more than 23,800 liters of gasoline in May.
    The gasoline and diesel consumption of various motorcade teams under the Transportation Bureau of the Shandong Provincial Department of Transportation exceeded the regulations every month in the first quarter. After the implementation of fuel-saving measures by various motorcades in April, a total of more than 36,000 liters of gasoline and diesel have been saved so far.
    Drivers of the transportation company under the Department of Transportation of Xikang Province used to think that wasting gasoline was unavoidable when driving cars on the Kangzang Plateau. After labor models and advanced workers Xun Zhixiong, Lou Yuebo and others promoted advanced fuel-saving methods, the fuel consumption of the No. 3 motorcade in April decreased by 4.87% compared with March.

    许多汽车司机注意节省汽油
    山东、新疆、四川、安徽等十几个省的国营汽车运输公司，采取许多措施节约汽油和柴油。新疆省交通厅运输局所属各车队的司机，学习了董凤鸣节约汽油的先进经验后，四月份各队油料消耗和三月份比较，共节省了七十六吨多汽油；全局五月份又有百分之八十以上的汽车推广了董凤鸣节油先进经验。目前，各车队正在加强保养车辆和改进技术操作，争取提前完成今年每一辆车给国家节省一点四吨汽油的计划。
    四川省交通厅运输局所属各运输公司的司机，普遍加强了车辆的技术保养，并改进了驾驶方法，五月份共节省了二万三千八百多公升汽油。
    山东省交通厅运输局所属的各汽车车队，第一季度内每月汽油和柴油的消耗都超过规定。四月份各汽车队贯彻节约燃料的措施后，到现在共节约了三万六千多公升汽油和柴油。
    西康省交通厅所属运输公司的司机，过去认为在康藏高原上开汽车浪费汽油是难免的。经过劳动模范及先进工作者荀志雄、娄月波等推广先进节油方法后，汽车三队四月份用油量较三月份降低了百分之四点八七。　（新华社）
