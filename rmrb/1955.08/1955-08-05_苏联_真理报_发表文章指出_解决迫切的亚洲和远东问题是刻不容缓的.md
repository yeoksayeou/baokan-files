Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 3rd: TASS reported from Moscow on August 3rd: "Pravda" published an article by Mayevsky entitled "Solving Urgent Asian and Far Eastern Issues is Imperative."

The article stated: Public opinion in various countries points out that the success of the Geneva Four-Power Conference was due to the fact that the conference discussed significant international issues with a realistic attitude and a sincere spirit, driven by the desire to build international trust and ease international tensions. If the foreign ministers also discuss issues with the same realistic attitude at the meeting to be held in October, then this meeting may expand the achievements made by the Geneva Conference.

The article then stated that the issues already included in the agenda of the upcoming Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference are of great international significance and must be resolved. However, it must not be forgotten that, in order to safeguard the peace and security of all countries, it is equally important to resolve the urgent issues in Asia and the Far East without delay. The fact that these issues have not yet been resolved remains a serious source of international tension.

The article stated that the establishment and consolidation of the People's Republic of China is the most important factor in the development of the political situation in Asia over the past six years. No Asian and Far Eastern issue can be resolved without taking into account the interests of the People's Republic of China and without the participation of the People's Republic of China. All this once again emphasizes how abnormal it is that the People's Republic of China has not yet obtained its legitimate seat in the United Nations to this day. It is very clear that this situation not only undermines the prestige of the United Nations, but also seriously complicates the entire international situation.

The article then pointed out that, in order to ease tensions in the Far East, the Chinese People's Government proposed direct negotiations between China and the United States at the Bandung Asian-African Conference. Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the recent meeting of the National People's Congress of China once again clearly demonstrated the peaceful policies of the People's Republic of China. The peaceful actions of the People's Republic of China have received warm support from the people of Asian countries, the Soviet Union, the people's democracies, and all peace-loving forces in Europe and the Americas.

Referring to the ambassadorial talks between China and the United States that began in Geneva on August 1st, the article wrote: The purpose of these talks is to resolve the issue of the repatriation of civilians from both sides, and to facilitate further discussion and resolution of certain other issues currently in dispute between the two sides. It should be pointed out that on the eve of the meeting between the ambassadors of the two countries, the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China decided to release eleven American spies detained in China ahead of schedule and decided to send them out of the territory of the People's Republic of China. This solved a problem that some reactionary elements in the United States had recently used extensively to instigate anti-China movements.

The fact that the United States agreed to hold talks with representatives of the People's Republic of China in Geneva proves a certain shift in the United States' attitude towards Far Eastern issues towards reality. In recent months, American politicians and public leaders have been increasingly insistent on adjusting relations between the United States and China. But it must be pointed out that a negative, unrealistic attitude continues to dominate in some people. For example, some American newspapers are still emphasizing that the United States should negotiate with China from a "position of strength."

The article said that many newspapers and political commentators in Asia and Europe correctly pointed out that as long as both China and the United States show sincerity and are prepared to consider the interests of all parties concerned, the Sino-US talks can be successful and can promote the resolution of important issues in Asia and the Far East.

The article also pointed out that the implementation of agreements already reached on certain Asian and Far Eastern issues is also of great significance. The South Vietnamese authorities are violating the 1954 Geneva Accords on the restoration of peace in Indochina, undermining the work of the International Commission, undermining the holding of general elections, and deepening the division of Vietnam. The interests of peace in the Far East also require Korea to achieve a stable ceasefire and to achieve peaceful reunification in the future. However, the steps taken by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in this regard have not been supported by South Korea. Finally, it must also be mentioned that to this day, relations between Japan and its closest neighbors on the mainland have not been normalized.

The article concluded by saying that the situation in some areas of Asia clearly illustrates that a careful study and resolution of the urgent issues in this region is urgently needed. The sooner the urgent issues in Asia and the Far East are resolved, the more conducive it will be to easing international tensions and safeguarding international peace and security.

### 苏联“真理报”发表文章指出  解决迫切的亚洲和远东问题是刻不容缓的

    苏联“真理报”发表文章指出
    解决迫切的亚洲和远东问题是刻不容缓的
    新华社三日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科三日讯：“真理报”刊载了马耶夫斯基的一篇文章，题目是“解决迫切的亚洲和远东问题是刻不容缓的”。
    文章说：各国舆论指出，日内瓦四大国会议之所以能够取得成功，是由于会议在建立国际间的信任以缓和国际局势的愿望的驱使下，以现实的态度和具有诚意的精神讨论了重大的国际问题。如果外长们在十月举行的会议上也用同样的现实态度来讨论问题，那末，这个会议就可能扩大日内瓦会议所取得的成就。
    文章接着说，已经包括在将要举行的四国外长会议的议程中的问题都是具有重大的国际意义的，必须加以解决。但是，决不能忘记，为了维护各国的和平和安全，毫不拖延地解决亚洲和远东的迫切问题也是同样重要的。这些问题至今仍然没有得到解决是国际紧张局势的一个严重根源。
    文章说，中华人民共和国的建立和巩固是过去六年来亚洲政治局势发展中最重要的因素。没有一个亚洲和远东的问题是能够在不考虑到中华人民共和国的利益和没有中华人民共和国参加的情况下得到解决的。所有这一切再一次着重说明，中华人民共和国直到今天还没有取得它在联合国中的合法席位是多么不正常。非常明显，这种情况不但破坏了联合国的威信，而且严重地使整个国际局势复杂化。
    文章接着指出，为了缓和远东的紧张局势，中国人民政府曾在万隆亚非会议上建议中国和美国进行直接谈判。周恩来总理在中国全国人民代表大会最近举行的会议上的发言再一次清楚地表明了中华人民共和国的和平政策。中华人民共和国的和平行动得到了亚洲各国人民、苏联、各人民民主国家以及欧洲和美洲一切爱好和平的力量的热烈支持。
    文章在谈到八月一日开始在日内瓦举行的中美两国大使级会谈时写道：这次会谈的目的是要解决双方平民的遣返问题，并有利于进一步讨论和解决双方目前有所争执的某些其他问题。应该指出，中华人民共和国最高人民法院在两国大使举行会谈的前夕，决定提前释放拘留在中国境内的十一名美国间谍，并决定把他们送出中华人民共和国国境。这样便解决了美国某些反动分子在最近一个时期广泛用来激起反中国的运动的一个问题。
    美国同意在日内瓦和中华人民共和国代表举行会谈，这件事的本身就证明了美国对远东问题的态度有转向现实的某种改变。近几个月来，美国的政治家和公众领袖正在日益坚决地要求调整美国和中国之间的关系。但是必须指出，一种消极的、非现实的态度仍然继续在某些人士中占统治地位。例如美国的某些报纸仍然在强调美国应该从“实力地位”出发来同中国谈判。
    文章说，亚洲和欧洲的许多报纸的政治评论家正确地指出，只要中美双方表现出诚意和准备考虑各有关方面的利益，那末，中美会谈就可以获得成功，并且可以促进亚洲和远东的重要问题的解决。
    文章并且指出，在某些亚洲和远东问题上已经达成的协定的执行也是具有重大意义的。南越当局正在违反一九五四年关于恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦协定，破坏国际委员会的工作，破坏普选的举行和加深越南的分裂状态。远东的和平的利益还要求朝鲜获得稳定的停战和在将来得到和平统一。然而，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在这方面所采取的步骤并没有得到南朝鲜的支持。最后，还必须提到：直到今天，日本和它在大陆上的最近的邻国的关系还没有正常化。
    文章最后说，因此，亚洲的若干地区的局势清楚地说明了，仔细研究和解决这个地区的迫切问题是迫切需要的。亚洲和远东的迫切问题解决得愈早，就愈有利于缓和国际紧张局势和维护国际和平和安全。
