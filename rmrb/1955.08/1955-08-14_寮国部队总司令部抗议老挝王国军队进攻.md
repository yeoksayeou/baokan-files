Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 12th: Vietnam News Agency reports: On August 9th, the High Command of the Lao Patriotic Forces wrote to the International Commission, protesting the Royal Lao authorities' continued increase of troops and attacks on the Lao Patriotic Forces' regroupment areas in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly.

The letter states that from mid-July to the present, the Royal Lao side has continued to attack the Lao Patriotic Forces north and southeast of Muong Phanh, in order to realize its plot to occupy the two provinces where the Lao Patriotic Forces are regrouped before the general election.

The letter points out that when the Royal Lao Army invaded the regroupment areas of the Lao Patriotic Forces, it completely burned down Don Tai village in Nam Don commune, Muong Het district, killing and arresting a number of people.

The Lao Patriotic Forces pointed out in the letter that the Royal Lao Army launched its attack while the political and military conferences were discussing the issue of general elections and the cessation of military offensives by both sides, proving that the Royal Lao authorities are unwilling to genuinely negotiate and still want to use force to invade the regroupment areas of the Lao Patriotic Forces.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 12th: According to "Laos News," on the evening of August 5th, the Royal Lao Forces launched a new offensive against the Lao Patriotic Forces in the area surrounding Muong Phanh.

On August 7th, the Royal Government army split into two groups, one from Ban Chang and the other from Ban Kiet, extending towards Hoi Hop, four kilometers south of Ban Kiet, attacking the Lao Patriotic Forces stationed there, and have now occupied Hoi Hop.

"Laos News" said that these continuous offensives prove that the Royal Government is still unwilling to respect the ceasefire agreement reached by both sides on March 9th, unwilling to stop military offensives against the two provinces, and still attempting to eliminate the Lao Patriotic Forces.

    寮国部队总司令部抗议老挝王国军队进攻
    新华社河内十二日电　越南通讯社讯：八月九日，寮国战斗部队总司令部写信给国际委员会，抗议老挝王国当局继续增加军队，进攻寮国战斗部队集结区桑怒、丰沙里两省。
    信上说，从七月中旬到现在老挝王国方面继续向芒奔以北和东南的寮国战斗部队进攻，以实现普选前占领寮国战斗部队集结的两省的阴谋。
    信中指出，老挝王国军队，在侵入寮国战斗部队集结地区时，曾全部烧毁了和芒县南顿乡，杀死和逮捕了一批人民。
    寮国战斗部队在信中指出，老挝王国军队在政治会议和军事会议正在讨论普选问题和停止双方的军事进攻问题的时候发动进攻，证明了老挝王国当局不愿意真正进行协商，并且仍旧想以武力来侵占寮国战斗部队集结区。
    新华社河内十二日电　据“寮国新闻”消息，八月五日晚，老挝王国部队对芒奔周围地区的寮国战斗部队发动了新的进攻。
    八月七日，王国政府军队又分成两股，一股从班敞，一股从班结，向班结以南四公里的会合伸展，进攻驻扎在那里的寮国战斗部队，目前已经占领了会合。
    “寮国新闻”说，这些连续的进攻证明了王国政府仍旧不肯尊重三月九日双方达成的停止敌对行动协议，不肯停止对两省的军事进攻，而仍旧企图消灭寮国战斗部队。
