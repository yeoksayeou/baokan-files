    Translating and publishing play an extremely significant role in international cultural exchange and the introduction of outstanding cultural achievements from other countries. The spread of Marxism-Leninism to our country relied, to a large extent, on the translation work of many revolutionary pioneers around the May Fourth Movement, such as Comrade Qu Qiubai. The revolutionary teachers Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin all attached great importance to translation work. For example, Engels translated the works of Charles Fourier. Marx proofread the French translation of "Das Kapital," and Engels proofread the English translation of "The Communist Manifesto." Lenin not only demanded strictness of himself in translation work but also severely criticized those translations that distorted the meaning of the original text, especially the poor Russian translations of the works of Marx and Engels.
    Since the nationwide liberation, thanks to the care of the Communist Party and the People's Government, China's translation and publishing work has greatly developed. From October 1949 to May of this year, our country has translated and published books from more than 30 countries, totaling over 10,000 titles. Among them, Soviet books account for about 84 percent, totaling more than 8,400 titles. Moreover, the proportion of Soviet books in all translated and published books has been increasing year by year, which fully reflects the enthusiasm of our people in learning the most advanced socialist culture of mankind.
    The writings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin occupy a primary position in all translated books. From October 1949 to May of this year, a total of 209 titles were published.
    A large portion of the translated books are social science works. These works introduce the experiences of the revolutionary struggles of people from various countries, especially the theory and experience of the Soviet people in building a socialist society and the people's democratic countries in carrying out socialist construction. There are more than 2,000 such books, of which about 1,900 are Soviet books.
    More than 3,400 books on natural science and production technology have been translated and published, making them the largest category of all translated books. Among them, Soviet books alone account for more than 2,400, and the volume of translation and publication of such books has been growing rapidly year by year. In 1951, there were 180 titles, which increased to 528 in 1953, and further increased to nearly 1,000 in 1954. The translation and publication of these works have greatly helped China's socialist construction and socialist transformation, and have also played a significant role in enriching the teaching content of China's higher education and vocational schools. In addition, we have also translated some academic masterpieces from capitalist countries. For example, Darwin's "The Origin of Species" has been re-translated and published.
    In recent years, we have also translated and published a large number of foreign literary books, totaling nearly 3,000 titles. A large number of Soviet literary works have been issued in editions of more than 100,000 copies, and individual translations, such as "The Story of Zoya and Shura," have been issued in editions of more than one million copies. Literary works from people's democratic countries are also greatly welcomed by the Chinese people. For example, Czech writer Julius Fučík's "Report from the Gallows" has been translated into three languages in China, with more than 700,000 copies printed. The heroic images in these works have profoundly educated the Chinese people. Among the translated literary books, there are also many excellent works from capitalist countries.
    However, at present, our translated books are still far behind the needs of Chinese readers in terms of both quantity and quality.
    Here are a few examples.
    Although we have translated and published many Soviet books, we still lack systematicness and planning. For example, many advanced Soviet sciences and technologies have not been introduced, and many Soviet theoretical works on building socialism and popular works explaining Marxist-Leninist theory have not been translated.
    As for books from other countries, we have translated and published even less. Some countries that have close relations with our country in international affairs, such as most countries in Asia and Africa, have not had their books translated and published by us. India, Japan, and many other countries have many outstanding classical and modern masterpieces that we have not yet translated.
    The works of many foreign writers who are popular with the people have been translated and published very little, or even not at all. For example, the works of Jules Verne, the 19th-century French science fiction and adventure novelist, have been translated and published in large quantities in the Soviet Union, but in China, except for a not very good translation published decades ago, his other works have not yet been translated and published. Also, among the world's progressive writers mentioned by Tikhonov in his report "Modern World Progressive Literature" at the Second All-Union Congress of Writers, many writers are quite unfamiliar to Chinese readers.
    Another major shortcoming of our translation and publishing work in recent years is that many important foreign academic works have not been translated, or there are only some older and poorer translations. For example, the outstanding works of many Western European philosophers of the 17th and 18th centuries, such as Francis Bacon's "Novum Organum," Spinoza's "Ethics," Locke's "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding," Radishchev's "On Man, On His Mortality and Immortality," La Mettrie's "Man a Machine," and the works of Montesquieu, one of the world's cultural celebrities commemorated this year.
    The main reason for the above shortcomings is, first of all, that publishing houses do not pay enough attention to and lack experience in formulating translation topic selection plans. The topic selection plan is the foundation of the publishing house's work. Only by correctly formulating the translation topic selection plan can we ensure that translation and publishing work has a clear direction and goal, and can we invite translators and organize manuscripts in a planned manner. When formulating the translation topic selection plan, we must not only take into account the current needs of the country and the people, but also take into account the needs of the considerable long term in the future. In recent years, Chinese publishing houses have learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and have begun to compile topic selection plans. However, they generally lack experience in compiling translation topic selection plans, and some publishing houses still do not pay enough attention to compiling translation topic selection plans. The main manifestations are that the translation topic selection plans are still chaotic and poor, and some publishing houses even select books based on what they see, or select books based on what translators propose, without making a comprehensive and careful study. As a result, there is a great deal of spontaneity and randomness in publishing books. What should be published is not published, and what should not be published is published instead. Therefore, in future translation and publishing work, publishing houses must further establish a planned thinking, and carefully and thoroughly formulate translation topic selection plans.
    Another main reason for the above shortcomings is that publishing houses have not done enough to unite, organize, help, and cultivate translators, especially new translators. At present, there is still a relatively common phenomenon among publishing houses of valuing old translators and looking down on new translators, and not paying enough attention to helping and cultivating new translators. Moreover, in dealing with old translators, they have more confidence in translators who are more familiar and are willing to solicit manuscripts; they are not at ease with old translators who are not very familiar. They often adopt a rude and rash rejection attitude towards unfamiliar translators and new translators. For example, they often hold a distrustful mentality (fear of trouble, fear of problems) towards the manuscripts of unfamiliar translators, especially those lacking translation experience, and therefore nitpick their manuscripts, one-sidedly emphasizing quality. Some editors, after discovering some shortcomings in the translation of a new translator, threw the manuscript down and said: "This kind of person still wants to translate books!" This attitude is completely wrong and is fundamentally incompatible with the task of publishing houses to unite, organize, help, and cultivate translators. In addition, at present, publishing houses generally have a procrastinating style, or even a "pushing" attitude, in dealing with letters from unfamiliar translators and new translators. For example, a unit of the Northeast Agricultural College wrote to the Finance and Economics Publishing House this spring to contact about the translation and publication of a dozen books. After a long time, the translator received a reply. The letter said that three of the books had been organized by another group, and the other books "are not planned to be translated for the time being," and asked the translator to contact the Science Publishing House and other units. In this way, the translator had to write to contact other publishing houses. However, the reply that the translator received was: The task of publishing such books is undertaken by the Finance and Economics Publishing House and other units. Similar situations have been seen frequently in recent years. The reason for this is, of course, partly due to the fact that the division of translation and publishing work among the various publishing houses is not clear enough, but the main reason is that the publishing houses adopt a careless and irresponsible attitude when handling the manuscripts of new translators. To unite, organize, help, and cultivate translators, especially new translators, is not just empty talk. Publishing houses must truly recognize its importance ideologically and pay attention to it in their actual work.
    The lack of contact between publishing houses and between publishing houses and translators, resulting in phenomena of disconnection and duplication of waste, is also one of the main reasons for the above shortcomings. For example, last year, due to the lack of contact between the translation office of a certain central department and the publishing house, and the lack of contact between the publishing house they contacted and other publishing houses, more than a dozen manuscripts translated by this translation office (some of which were not completed) failed to be published. Therefore, translators must first contact the relevant publishing houses when translating, and there must be close contact and cooperation between publishing houses.
    In order to further develop translation and publishing work, we must also overcome the fame and profit-seeking thinking of some translators and the bourgeois management thinking of some publishing houses. For example, some translators only like to translate books with more readers, because this can "spread their name" further and get more royalties; some publishing houses also only like to publish such books, because this can obtain more profits. This is also one of the reasons for the current serious lack of translations of foreign academic works. In addition, some people believe that: We already have quite a few translated books, and foreign books are not entirely suitable for China's situation. This one-sided idea is also an obstacle to the further development of translation and publishing work, and must be overcome.
    It must also be pointed out that the current translated books generally have the shortcoming of not being of high quality. In many translated books, there are still situations where the sentences are not fluent and smooth, and there are still quite a few cases of mistranslation and omissions. Some publishing houses, especially some private publishing houses, still have the style of rushing to translate and publish early, and some translators still have the style of shoddy work. These bad styles must also be resolutely opposed.
    At present, we are facing the historical task of building our motherland into a great socialist country. Because our culture is still very backward, we urgently need to learn - to learn from the advanced theories and experiences of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and to learn from the progressive culture of capitalist countries. Comrade Mao Zedong has long taught us: "China should absorb a large amount of foreign progressive culture as the raw material for its own cultural food. This work has not been done well enough in the past. This includes not only the current socialist culture and new democratic culture, but also ancient foreign culture, such as the culture of the Enlightenment era in various capitalist countries. Anything that we can use today should be absorbed." ("On New Democracy") Therefore, publishing houses must mobilize and organize more translation forces, more widely and carefully cultivate and help translators, and translate and publish more outstanding foreign works to meet the growing cultural needs of our people.

    翻译出版更多的外国优秀著作
　　怀梓
    翻译工作对于交流国际文化、介绍其他国家的优秀文化成果，具有极其重大的作用。马克思列宁主义的传播到我国来，就曾经在很大程度上赖于“五四”前后许多革命先辈，如瞿秋白同志等的翻译劳动。革命导师马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林对翻译工作都很重视。例如，恩格斯曾经翻译过沙尔利·傅立叶的作品。马克思曾经校对过“资本论”的法译本，恩格斯曾经校对过“共产党宣言”的英译本。列宁也曾不仅在翻译工作上非常严格地要求自己，而且非常严厉地批评那些歪曲了原文意思的译本，特别是马克思和恩格斯著作的低劣的俄译本。
    全国解放以来，由于共产党和人民政府的关怀，我国的翻译出版工作有了很大的发展。从一九四九年十月到今年五月，我国翻译出版了三十多个国家的书籍，共计超过了一万种。其中苏联书籍约占百分之八十四，共计八千四百多种。而且，苏联书籍在全部翻译出版的书籍中所占的比重是逐年增长的，这充分反映了我国人民学习人类最先进的社会主义文化的热情。
    马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的著作，在全部翻译书籍中占着首要的地位。一九四九年十月到今年五月，共出版了二百零九种。
    翻译书籍中，很大一部分是社会科学的著作。这些著作介绍了各国人民革命斗争的经验，特别是苏联人民建成社会主义社会以及各人民民主国家进行社会主义建设的理论和经验。这类书有二千多种，其中苏联书籍约有一千九百种。
    自然科学和生产技术方面的书籍，共计翻译出版了三千四百多种，是全部翻译书籍中数量最大的一类。其中仅苏联书籍就有二千四百多种，而且这类书籍的翻译出版量逐年都在飞速增长。一九五一年为一百八十种，一九五三年增至五百二十八种，一九五四年更增至近千种。这些著作的翻译出版，对于我国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业有很大的帮助，对于充实我国的高等和专业学校的教学内容也起了显著的作用。另外，我们也翻译了一些资本主义国家的学术名著。例如，达尔文的“物种起源”，就已经重新翻译出版。
    这几年，我们也翻译出版了大量的外国文艺书籍，总数将近三千种。大批苏联文艺作品译本发行到十万册以上，个别译本，如“卓娅和舒拉的故事”已发行到百万册以上。人民民主国家的文艺作品也大为我国人民欢迎。例如捷克斯洛伐克作家伏契克的“绞刑架下的报告”，在我国被译成三种文字，印行七十多万册。这些作品中的英雄形象，深深地教育了我国人民。在翻译的文艺书籍中，还有不少资本主义国家的优秀作品。
    但是，目前我们的翻译书籍，在数量上和质量上，都还是远远地落后于我国读者的需要的。
    举几个例子来说。
    虽然我们翻译出版了很多苏联书籍，但是还缺乏系统性和计划性。例如，许多苏联先进的科学和技术没有得到介绍，许多苏联建成社会主义的理论著作和阐明马克思列宁主义理论的通俗著作也没有得到翻译。
    至于其他国家的书籍，我们就翻译出版得更不够了。有些在国际事务中同我国有密切关系的国家，如亚非两洲大部分国家，我们都还没有翻译出版过她们的书籍。印度、日本以及好些别的国家，有很多优秀的古典和现代的名著，我们也都还没有翻译出来。
    很多受人民欢迎的外国作家的作品，我们翻译出版得很少，甚至根本没有。例如，十九世纪法国科学幻想冒险小说家儒勒·维恩的作品在苏联已被大量翻译出版，但是我国除了有过一种几十年前出版的不大好的译本外，对于他的其他作品都还没有翻译出版。又如，吉洪诺夫在第二次全苏作家代表大会上所作报告“现代世界进步文学”中提到的世界进步作家中，有不少作家对于中国的读者说来，都是相当陌生的。
    几年来我们的翻译出版工作还有一个重大的缺点，那就是很多重要的外国学术著作没有翻译出来，或者只有一些较旧较差的译本。例如，十七、八世纪很多西欧哲学家的杰出著作，如弗兰西斯·培根的“新工具”、斯宾诺莎的“伦理学”、洛克的“人类悟性论”、拉吉舍夫的“论人、论人的死和不死”、拉美特利的“人是机器”，以及今年纪念的世界文化名人之一孟德斯鸠的著作。
    存在上述缺点的主要原因，首先是出版社对制定翻译选题计划的工作重视不够和经验不足。选题计划是出版社工作的基础。只有正确地制定翻译选题计划，才能保证翻译出版工作有明确的方向和目标，才能有计划地约请译者、组织译稿。制定翻译选题计划时，不仅要照顾到国家和人民当前的需要，而且要照顾到今后相当长期内的需要。几年来，我国出版社学习了苏联的先进经验，开始编制了选题计划。但是，他们对编制翻译选题计划还普遍缺乏经验，有些出版社对编制翻译选题计划仍然重视不足。主要的表现是，翻译选题计划还嫌混乱和贫乏，有的出版社甚至见到什么书就选什么书，见到译者提出什么书就选什么书，根本不作全面的仔细的研究。结果，造成出书的自发性和偶然性很大。该出的没出，不该出的倒反出了。因此，今后出版社在翻译出版工作中，必须进一步树立计划思想，并慎重地周密地制定翻译选题计划。
    存在上述缺点的另一个主要原因，是出版社对团结、组织、帮助和培养翻译工作者，特别是新生的翻译工作者的工作做得不够。目前，出版社间还比较普遍地存在着看重老译者而看不起新译者、对帮助和培养新译者重视不够的缺点。并且，在对待老译者方面，对比较熟悉的译者信心较大，愿意约稿；对不甚熟悉的老译者也不放心。他们对不熟悉的译者和新译者，往往采取粗暴轻率的拒绝态度。例如，他们对不熟悉的译者的稿子，特别是缺乏翻译经验的译者的稿子，往往怀着不信任的心理（怕麻烦、怕出问题），因而对他们的书稿吹毛求疵，片面强调质量。有的编辑人员在发现了新译者的译稿中一些缺点后，就将译稿一摔，说：“这种人还想译书！”这种态度是完全错误的，是同出版社的团结、组织、帮助和培养译者的任务根本不相容的。此外，目前出版社在处理不熟悉的译者和新译者的来信上，还比较普遍地有拖拉作风，甚至
  “推托”态度。例如，东北农学院某单位今年春天曾写信给财政经济出版社，联系十几本书的翻译出版事宜。过了很久，译者才接到复信。信中说其中三本书已另组稿，其他书“暂不拟约译”，要译者同科学出版社等单位联系。这样，译者就只得去信同别的出版社联系。但是，译者所得到的答复又是：这类书籍的出版任务，由财经出版社等单位担任。类似的情形，几年来屡见不鲜。究其原因，固然部分是由于各出版社之间翻译出版工作范围的划分尚欠明确，但是主要还是由于出版社在处理新译者的译稿时采取轻率和不够负责的态度。团结、组织、帮助和培养翻译工作者，特别是新生的翻译工作者，这不是一句空话。出版社必须在思想上真正认识其重要性，并在实际工作中加以注意。
    各出版社之间、出版社同译者之间的联系不够，以致产生脱节和重复浪费的现象，这也是产生上述缺点的主要原因之一。例如去年一年中，由于中央某部翻译室同出版社联系不够，以及他们接洽的出版社同别的出版社联系不够，所以这个翻译室译了十多部书稿（其中部分稿子未译完）都未能出版。因此，译者在翻译时一定要先同有关出版社联系，出版社之间也一定要有密切的联系和配合。
    为了进一步开展翻译出版工作，还必须克服某些翻译工作者的名利思想，以及某些出版社的资产阶级经营思想。例如，有些翻译工作者光爱翻译读者较多的书籍，因为这样可以“传名”较远，可以拿到较多的稿费；有些出版社也光爱出版这类书籍，因为这样可以获得较多的利润。这也是造成目前外国学术著作译本严重缺乏的一个原因。此外，有些人认为：我们的翻译书已经很不少了，外国的书不完全适合我国的情况。这种片面的想法也是翻译出版工作进一步开展的障碍，必须加以克服。
    同时必须提出，目前的翻译书籍还比较普遍地存在着质量不高的缺点。好些翻译书籍中，还有文句不流畅、不通顺的情形，错译、漏译的情形也还不少。部分出版社，特别是部分私营出版社仍然有抢译早出的作风，部分译者也仍然有粗制滥造的作风。这些不良的作风也是必须坚决反对的。
    目前，我们面临着把我们的祖国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家的历史任务。由于我们的文化还很落后，我们迫切地需要学习，——从苏联和各人民民主国家的先进的理论和经验中学习，从资本主义国家的进步文化中学习。毛泽东同志早就教导我们：“中国应该大量吸收外国的进步文化，作为自己文化食粮的原料，这种工作过去还做得很不够。这不但是当前的社会主义文化和新民主主义文化，还有外国的古代文化，例如各资本主义国家启蒙时代的文化，凡属我们今天用得着的东西，都应该吸收。”（“新民主主义论”）因此，出版社必须动员和组织更多的翻译力量，更广泛地更细心地培养和帮助翻译工作者，翻译出版更多的外国优秀作品，来满足我国人民的日益增长的文化需要。
