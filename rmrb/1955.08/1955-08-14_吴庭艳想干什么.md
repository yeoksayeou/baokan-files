What Does Ngo Dinh Diem Want?
By Zhan Chao, Special Correspondent for the People's Daily in Vietnam

According to the final declaration of the Geneva Conference, the representative responsible authorities of both North and South Vietnam should conduct consultations on the issue of nationwide general elections in Vietnam starting from July 20, 1955. Before July 20th, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had already sent a note to the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem government, requesting that both sides hold consultations as scheduled. The South Vietnamese government did not issue a formal statement responding to the note from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam government until August 10.

In addition to rehashing some old tunes from the past, Ngo Dinh Diem government's statement avoids any mention of the urgent consultation issue at hand and openly refuses to assume its obligations under the Geneva Accords.

What exactly does Ngo Dinh Diem want? Now anyone can see it clearly. Aside from attempting to cope with the increasing pressure of domestic and international public opinion by playing with pretty words such as "freedom" and "unity," Ngo Dinh Diem and his clique are unwilling to take a single step on any practical issues related to freedom and unity.

In the August 10th statement, Ngo Dinh Diem insisted that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's note of July 19th was for "propaganda" purposes. But everyone can see that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's note put forward concrete suggestions, requesting consultations as scheduled and early preparations for free general elections; while the Ngo Dinh Diem government's statement was simply filled with hypocritical empty talk and stale platitudes, without daring to touch on any practical issues.

In this statement, the Ngo Dinh Diem government once again tried to portray itself as the defender of Vietnamese "unity" and "free" general elections. However, people cannot help but ask: Since the Ngo Dinh Diem clique values "unity," why don't they actively seek unity in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords? Instead, they are trying their best to turn the temporary military demarcation line, which is clearly written in the Geneva Accords, into a line dividing Vietnam, doing everything possible to obstruct the establishment of normal relations between North and South Vietnam, and inducing and abducting residents from the North to the South, preventing residents who want to return home from returning to the North? Since the Ngo Dinh Diem clique supports the principle of free general elections as touted in the statement, why don't they dare to sit down with representatives of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to negotiate in order to arrange free general elections? Instead, they arrest those who advocate consultation everywhere, imprison them, and destroy their spirit and body?

The Ngo Dinh Diem clique also said that because there are no "conditions for free life and free voting" in the North, there is no question of holding general elections. If this is the case, why don't they dare to make serious arrangements, as advocated by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam government in its statement of June 6 and its note of July 19, to ensure the freedom of election for all political parties, groups, and individuals, allowing the people to freely choose and freely express their wishes? Why do they even refuse to negotiate on the issue of arranging free elections? Lies are bound to be exposed in the face of facts.

The seriousness of the problem lies in the fact that Ngo Dinh Diem government's behavior of publicly abandoning the Geneva Accords this time has its international background. Ngo Dinh Diem government's August 10th statement said: "It believes that it is in no way bound by the Geneva Accords that it did not sign." And from Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles quickly echoed: Ngo Dinh Diem's attitude is "correct." In fact, such a statement from Ngo Dinh Diem government is not new. Long before this statement was issued, the State Department in Washington had already been spreading this view. Now, this is just pushing the Ngo Dinh Diem government to the front to charge into battle. Isn't it clear enough: The United States is instructing the Ngo Dinh Diem government to come forward to oppose consultations, using denial to undermine the Geneva Accords and obstruct the holding of general elections, and then come to express support for this "attitude" of the Ngo Dinh Diem government.

Sincere consultations will lead to the peaceful reunification of Vietnam through the path of free general elections. This is what the Ngo Dinh Diem clique and the United States are unwilling to see. The root of the matter lies here.

People see that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is doing everything possible to maintain the division of Vietnam in order to turn the area south of the 17th parallel north latitude into a U.S. military base.

Ngo Dinh Diem clique's refusal to consult on general elections is a serious threat to the full implementation of the Geneva Accords and a conspiracy to undermine peace in Indochina and the trend of easing international tensions.

The Vietnamese people will be a hundred times more vigilant in the face of this new serious event. They have waged a long struggle for national independence and unity. The Geneva Accords affirmed the victorious results of this struggle of the Vietnamese people. Today, the Vietnamese people will continue to strive for the implementation of the Geneva Accords, striving to convene consultation conferences to achieve free general elections in order to complete the reunification and independence of the motherland, regardless of any obstacles and difficulties.

    吴庭艳想干什么
    本报驻越南记者　展潮
    按照日内瓦会议最后宣言的规定，自一九五五年七月二十日起，越南南北双方地区有代表性的负责当局，应就越南全国举行普选问题进行协商。早在七月二十日前，越南民主共和国就照会南越吴庭艳政府，要求双方如期举行协商。南越政府迟至八月十日才发布了一项正式声明，答复越南民主共和国政府的照会。
    吴庭艳政府的这个声明，除了重弹过去的一些老调外，绝口不谈摆在面前迫切需要解决的协商问题，而且公然拒绝承担对日内瓦协定的义务。
    吴庭艳到底想干什么？现在任何人都可以看得清清楚楚了。吴庭艳及其集团除了企图以玩弄“自由”、“统一”等漂亮词句，来应付愈益增强着的国内外舆论的压力以外，是不愿在任何有关自由、统一的实际问题上走一步的。
    在八月十日的声明里，吴庭艳硬说越南民主共和国七月十九日的照会是为了“宣传”的目的。可是大家都看到，在越南民主共和国政府的照会里，提出了具体建议，要求如期协商及早进行自由普选的准备工作；而在吴庭艳政府的声明里，却只是堆满了虚伪的空话和陈腐的高调，丝毫不敢涉及到任何实际问题。
    吴庭艳政府在这个声明里，又一次地想把自己装扮成为越南“统一”和“自由”普选的保卫者。但是，人们不禁要问：既然吴庭艳集团看重“统一”，为什么他们不按照日内瓦协定的规定，积极地谋求统一，却相反地竭力想把日内瓦协定上写的明明白白的临时军事分界线，变成分裂越南的分界线，极力阻挠越南南北正常关系的建立，并诱迫劫运北方的居民到南方去，不让要求回家的居民重返北方？既然吴庭艳集团像声明中所标榜的那样赞成自由普选的原则，为什么他们却偏偏不敢和越南民主共和国的代表坐下来协商，以便安排自由普选事宜；却相反地到处逮捕那些主张协商的人们，把他们关到牢里，摧残他们的精神和肉体？
    吴庭艳集团又说，因为北方没有“自由生活和自由投票的条件”，所以谈不上进行普选，既然如此，他们为什么又不敢像越南民主共和国政府在六月六日的声明以及七月十九日的照会里所主张的那样，认真安排，保证各政党、团体和个人的竞选自由，让人民自由地进行选择，自由地表达自己的意愿呢？为什么他们甚至拒绝就安排自由的普选的问题进行协商呢？谎话在事实的面前终归是要被戳穿的。
    问题的严重性在于吴庭艳政府这一次公开表示背弃日内瓦协定的行为，是有它的国际背景的。吴庭艳政府八月十日的声明中说：“它认为它丝毫不受它未曾签字的日内瓦协定的约束”。而从华盛顿，美国国务卿杜勒斯很快就呼应说：吴庭艳的态度是“正确”的。实际上，吴庭艳政府的这样一种声明，并不是新的，早在这个声明发表以前，华盛顿国务院方面就已经在散布这种论调了。现在，这不过是把吴庭艳政府推到前面来冲阵而已。难道还不够明白么：美国指使吴庭艳政府出面反对协商，用抵赖的办法来破坏日内瓦协定，阻挠普选的举行，然后又来对吴庭艳政府这种“态度”表示支持。
    真诚的协商将会导致越南通过自由普选的道路实现全国的和平统一，这是吴庭艳集团和美国所不愿意的。事情的根由就在这里。
    人们看到，吴庭艳集团正在千方百计地努力保持越南的分裂，以便把北纬十七度线以南的地区变成为美国的军事基地。
    吴庭艳集团拒绝协商普选，是对日内瓦协定全部实施的严重威胁，也是破坏印度支那和平和国际局势的和缓趋势的一个阴谋。
    越南人民在这新的严重事件面前，将百倍地提高警惕。他们为了民族独立和统一，曾进行了长期的斗争。日内瓦协定肯定了越南人民这个斗争的胜利成果。今天，越南人民将继续为贯彻日内瓦协定，争取召开协商会议以实现自由普选来完成祖国的统一和独立而奋斗，不顾任何阻挠和困难。
