    Determined to Overcome Natural Disasters and Complete the Plan to Produce 500,000 Jin of Grain
    To the Editor:
    Comrade Li Fuchun's report greatly encouraged us. In particular, the part of the report concerning agricultural production made us more clearly and concretely aware of the direction of our efforts.
    Our agricultural production cooperative suffered another flood in June this year, with more than 1,100 mu of early rice and more than 300 mu of cotton being flooded. But we were not pessimistic or disappointed. We fought tenaciously against the disaster. When the floodwaters just began to recede, we formulated a production and disaster relief plan: rush-plant 800 mu of late rice, producing 240,000 jin of grain; plant 100 mu of sesame, producing 10,000 jin of sesame, equivalent to 30,000 jin of grain; plant 260 mu of millet (including 20 mu of reclaimed wasteland), producing 78,000 jin of grain; plant 50 mu of sweet potatoes, producing 75,000 jin, equivalent to 19,000 jin of grain; plant 80 mu of beans, harvesting 6,400 jin, equivalent to 20,000 jin of grain; plus the income from the mid-season rice fields in the mountains, our entire cooperative can produce a total of 500,000 jin and 7,000 jin of grain this autumn. After deducting the amount for the members' consumption, we can still have more than 200,000 jin of grain to support national construction.
    After the plan was formulated, everyone actively took action. In order to achieve "fields waiting for seedlings, transplanting seedlings as early as possible," we had already leveled and harrowed all the more than 500 mu of rice paddies that had emerged from the water. By July 15, we had already transplanted more than 300 mu of late rice. One hundred mu of sesame and eighty mu of beans have all been planted. The 250 mu of land prepared for millet planting is being prepared, and it can be planted as soon as the millet seeds are delivered. Fifty mu of sweet potatoes were successively planted after July 15. In order to expand the cultivated area, we decided that each laborer should reclaim one mu of wasteland, and more than 50 mu have now been reclaimed. The radishes sown by each household are growing very well, and everyone is mixing them with rice to save grain.
    More than 130 female laborers in our cooperative, under the premise of doing a good job in summer hygiene, launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign. Now piles of dry cow dung and ash fertilizer can be seen everywhere in the cooperative.
    In order to repair the water conservancy projects damaged by the flood, we concentrated more than 100 laborers for a week, crossed the rushing floodwaters, and rushed to block the breach in the reservoir. We also decided that from July 16, we would concentrate 40 male laborers and 70 female laborers every day to build a spillway on the embankment to prevent the river water from rising and invading the polder. Because it has not rained for more than 20 days after the flood, our paddy fields in the mountains have experienced drought. We are using five large waterwheels to draw water to ensure that no field is dried up or reduced in production due to drought.
    We guarantee that we will "not leave a single field uncultivated, nor leave a single person idle," and complete this year's production plan to support the realization of the First Five-Year Plan.

    决心战胜自然灾害，完成生产五十万斤粮食的计划编辑同志：
    李富春同志的报告使我们受到很大的鼓舞，特别是报告中有关农业生产的部分使我们更加明确、更加具体地认识了我们努力的方向。
    我们农业生产合作社今年六月间又遭了水灾，有一千一百多亩早稻和三百多亩棉花被水淹了。但是我们没有悲观失望，我们同灾害进行了顽强的斗争。在洪水刚刚开始转退的时候，我们就制定了生产救灾计划：抢插晚稻八百亩，产粮二十四万斤；种芝麻一百亩，产芝麻一万斤，折粮三万斤；种粟二百六十亩（内开荒二十亩），产粮七万八千斤；种红薯五十亩，产七万五千斤，折谷一万九千斤；种豆子八十亩，收六千四百斤，折谷二万斤；再加上山里中稻田的收入，我们全社今秋共可产粮食五十万另七千多斤，除了社员吃用以外，还可以有二十多万斤粮食支援国家建设。
    计划制定以后，大家都积极行动起来了。为了做到“田等秧、及早插秧”，我们早就将退出水面的五百多亩水稻田全部整平耙好，到七月十五日为止已经补插了三百多亩晚稻。一百亩芝麻和八十亩豆子已经全部种完了。准备种粟的二百五十亩地正在进行整地，等到粟种运到就可种下。五十亩红薯在七月十五日以后就陆续插下。为了扩大耕种面积，我们决定每个劳力要开一亩荒地，现在已开出了五十多亩。每户人家播种的萝卜都长得很好，大家都掺在饭里吃，来节约粮食。
    我们社里一百三十多个妇女劳力，在搞好夏令卫生的前提下，开展了积肥运动。现在社里到处都可以看到一堆堆的干牛粪和灰肥。
    为了修复被洪水冲坏的水利工程，我们在一个星期的时间内，集中了一百多个劳力，越过洪水急流，抢堵好了水库缺口。我们还决定从七月十六日起，每天集中四十个男劳力和七十个女劳力上堤筑好溢水壋，以防止河内水涨侵入圩内。因为涨水后已有二十多天没有下雨，目前我们山里的禾田，已经发生了干旱现象。我们正用五盘大水车车水，保证不使一亩田因受旱而干死或减产。
    我们保证，一定要做到“不空一丘田，不闲一个人”，完成今年生产计划，来支持第一个五年计划的实现。
