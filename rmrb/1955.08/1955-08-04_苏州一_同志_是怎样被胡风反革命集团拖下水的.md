How a "Comrade" in Suzhou Was Dragged into the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique
    Sun Dong
    In the "Third Batch of Materials Regarding the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique," Ouyang Zhuang, a key member of the Hu Feng clique, wrote in a secret letter to Hu Feng: "There is a comrade in Suzhou who can be talked to (works in the Municipal Party Committee, a Party member). This person suffered a blow in the early days of liberation ('liberalism'), and may have a weaker fighting spirit, but it is worth a try." What exactly happened to this "comrade" after the Hu Feng elements gave it "a try"?
    Now the issue is completely clear: This "comrade" did not withstand the "try" of the Hu Feng elements and has been dragged into the water, becoming a "comrade" of the Hu Feng elements.
    This "comrade" is Xu Junjing of the Discipline Inspection Commission of the CPC Suzhou Municipal Committee. In 1946, he met Ouyang Zhuang. Later, through Ouyang Zhuang's introduction, he met Lu Ling, a key member of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. Through Lu Ling's connections, he also met several other key members of the Hu Feng clique. During this process, Ouyang Zhuang constantly boasted about how "remarkable" the figures in the Hu Feng clique were, constantly introduced him to the "works" of the Hu Feng elements, and frequently fabricated stories about how the central responsible comrades "valued" Hu Feng, in order to elevate Hu Feng's status. He also spread rumors slandering revolutionary writers, making him believe that revolutionary writers all had problems, and that only the "works" of the "writers" of the Hu Feng clique were a "source of unceasing flow." He made him believe that the leading cadres of the Party's literary and artistic work at that time were not as "correct," "capable," and "organized" as Hu Feng, and that there was a "naturalistic tendency" in the works of revolutionary writers, and that revolutionary literary and artistic theory was "mechanistic," and so on. In this way, Ouyang Zhuang laid the counter-revolutionary "ideological foundation" in Xu Junjing's mind.
    Before and after the liberation of Suzhou, Xu Junjing was subjected to Party disciplinary action for committing serious liberalistic errors, and Ouyang Zhuang wrote to Hu Feng secretly reporting that it was worth "a try."
    How did they "try"?
    First, Ouyang Zhuang used Xu Junjing's dissatisfaction with the Party after being punished to encourage Xu to resist the Party more in his thinking. At that time, Ouyang Zhuang showed Xu special "sympathy" and "concern," saying that the Party did not believe in Xu, and solicitously asked Xu to "take care of his health."
    At that time, Xu Junjing wrote to Lu Ling, asking Lu Ling what liberalism was. How did Lu Ling answer? He replied: "Liberalism begins with resistance to reality, but without restraint, it indulges to the point of being irreparable." Here we cannot help but ask: "Resistance to reality," what exactly does reality refer to? What does "resistance" mean "resistance" to? The reason why Xu was punished was that he violated Party discipline. The Party gave him the punishment he deserved in order to help him face up to his mistakes and educate him to correct them and become a true Communist Party member. Everyone knows that what we should resist is the unreasonable social reality, and the Party's discipline is the guarantee for our Party's victory in the revolutionary struggle. Abiding by Party discipline is the basic condition for every Communist Party member. Lu Ling here described Xu Junjing's serious liberalistic error as "resistance to reality." Isn't this clearly telling Xu to resist Party discipline? In the same letter, Lu Ling pretended to be compassionate and wrote: "Your mood is bitter." This means: Poor Xu Junjing, your resistance to "reality" (that is, resistance to Party discipline) is correct, but you have not exercised restraint (that is, you have not yet learned the counter-revolutionary two-faced tricks of the Hu Feng elements), and now it is irreparable (that is, you have been punished by the Party). I understand you and sincerely sympathize with you. You should come to me. Here, the insidious counter-revolutionary elements extended their sinful bloody hands to Xu Junjing, and Xu Junjing, who insisted on a liberalistic error stance, was thus caught by the bloody hands of the counter-revolutionary elements, unable to face up to his mistakes, leaving the Party and defecting to the counter-revolutionary elements.
    From then on, the Hu Feng elements further wooed Xu Junjing in the name of guiding his creation. In 1950, in a situation where Xu Junjing was becoming increasingly alienated from the Party and increasingly close to the Hu Feng elements, he wrote a long poem, "Workers," and asked Ouyang Zhuang for his opinion. Ouyang Zhuang then forwarded Xu's poem to Hu Feng and Hu Feng elements such as Lu Ling and Hua Tie to read, and later forwarded Hu Feng's "opinion" on the poem to Xu. Hu Feng wrote in his letter: "It can be seen that the author has a passion, but the emotions are flat and straight, without fluctuations, lacking change, and the main reason for the lack of rhythm is to delve into the historical content to absorb… I hope he will continue to write." This means that Xu Junjing's poems have not yet fully adapted to the requirements of the Hu Feng elements, but Hu Feng has "hope" for Xu Junjing, because he "has a passion," so he "hopes he will continue to write."
    We can see how "concerned" Hu Feng and the key members of the Hu Feng clique were about Communist Party members who had made mistakes. They mobilized key members of their clique, such as Ouyang Zhuang and Lu Ling, to "understand" his "mood," "care" about his "health," and instill the "theory" of confronting the Party and resisting the Party for Xu Junjing, a person who was "likely to have a weaker fighting spirit" within two years after being punished. Hu Feng even personally came forward to express his "hope" to Xu and "guide" Xu's "creation." As a result, as Xu Junjing himself said: "This group of guys with ulterior motives encouraged me, gave me instructions, and supported me, causing me to fall into an inextricable quagmire and become a member of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique." In 1954, when Ouyang Zhuang introduced another Hu Feng clique member to Xu, he referred to Xu as "one of us" in his letter.
    After Xu Junjing became "one of us" in the Hu Feng clique, he also frequently spread the Hu Feng clique's counter-revolutionary "theories" in his workplace, provided the Hu Feng clique with clues for "winning people over" and "contacting people," and carried out many anti-Party activities. When the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's "opinions" were printed and distributed, and criticism was launched in the Party newspapers, Xu even wrote to Ouyang Zhuang "angrily": "The knights (referring to revolutionary literary and artistic critics) are galloping again. A few dry dogmas, I am afraid, cannot make the air fragrant (meaning that correct criticism cannot play a role). I don't like watching lively masquerades (slandering criticism as wrong and hypocritical). I am watching 'The Peony Pavilion'…" At this time, his tone of speaking was exactly the same as Hu Feng's. Not only did he "have a passion," but he was also more daring to resist "reality," and his emotions were "fluctuating" and had "rhythm." This is the result of the Hu Feng clique's multifaceted "cultivation," a victory for the counter-revolutionary elements, but for Xu Junjing, who insisted on a liberalistic stance, it was truly "indulgence to the point of being irreparable."
    The incident of Xu Junjing being dragged into the water by the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique fully illustrates the correctness of the "People's Daily"'s note on Ouyang Zhuang's letter to Hu Feng in the "Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique." The "People's Daily" note said: "If a Communist Party member's liberalistic tendency is criticized, the Hu Feng elements call it 'suffering a blow.' If this person has a 'weaker fighting spirit,' that is, does not insist on a liberalistic stance, but is willing to accept the Party's criticism and turn to a correct stance, then for the Hu Feng clique, there is no hope, and they cannot pull this person away. If this person insists on a liberalistic stance and his 'fighting spirit' is not 'weaker' but 'better,' then this person is in danger of being pulled away." It was precisely because Xu Junjing was a person with a "better fighting spirit" who insisted on a liberalistic stance that he was pulled away after the Hu Feng clique gave it "a try."

### 苏州一“同志”是怎样被胡风反革命集团拖下水的

    苏州一“同志”是怎样被胡风反革命集团拖下水的
    孙东
    在“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”中，胡风集团骨干分子欧阳庄在给胡风的一封密信里写道：“苏州有一个同志可谈（在市委工作，党员），此人在解放初期受了打击（‘自由主义’），可能斗志较差，但可一试。”这个“同志”在胡风分子
  “一试”之下，到底怎样了呢？
    现在问题完全清楚了：这个“同志”，没有经得起胡风分子的“一试”，已经被拖下了水，变成了胡风分子的“同志”。
    这个“同志”，就是中共苏州市委纪律检查委员会的许君鲸。一九四六年，他就认识了欧阳庄，后来，由欧阳庄介绍，认识了胡风反革命集团的骨干分子路翎，通过路翎的关系，又认识了胡风集团的其他几个骨干分子。在这个过程中，欧阳庄不断向他吹嘘胡风集团中的人物如何“了不起”，不断介绍他读胡风分子的“作品”，经常地捏造中央的负责同志如何“重视”胡风，以此来提高胡风的身价，并散布污蔑革命作家的言论，使他相信革命作家都是有毛病的，只有胡风集团的“作家”的“作品”才是“喷流不息的源泉”，使他相信当时党的文艺工作领导干部都不如胡风“正确”、“能干”、“有组织能力”，使他相信革命作家的作品中有“自然主义倾向”，革命文艺理论是“机械论”等等。这样，欧阳庄就在许君鲸的头脑里打下了反革命的
  “思想基础”。
    苏州解放前后，许君鲸因犯了严重的自由主义错误受到党纪处分，欧阳庄便写信给胡风密告可以
  “一试”了。
    他们是怎样“一试”的呢？
    首先，欧阳庄利用许君鲸在受处分后对党的不满情绪，促使许在思想上更加和党对抗。当时，欧阳庄对许特别表示“同情”和“关切”，说党不相信许，殷勤地要许“注意身体”。
    当时，许君鲸写信给路翎，问路翎什么叫自由主义。路翎怎样回答的呢？他回答说：“自由主义开始对于现实的反抗，但未加节制，放任至不可收拾。”这里我们不禁要问：“对现实的反抗”，现实到底是指什么“现实”？“反抗”又是指“反抗”什么？许受处分的原因在于他违反了党的纪律，党给予他应得处分，是为了帮助他正视自己的错误，教育他改正错误，做个真正的共产党员。谁都知道，我们应该反抗的是不合理的社会现实，而党的纪律，则是我们党在革命斗争中取得胜利的保证。遵守党的纪律，是每个共产党员的起码条件。路翎在这里，把许君鲸所犯的严重的自由主义错误，说成是“对现实的反抗”，不是明明白白地要许反抗党的纪律吗？路翎在同一信里又假装悲天悯人地写道：“你的心情是苦的。”这就是说：可怜的许君鲸呀，你反抗“现实”（即反抗党的纪律）“反抗”得对，可是你未加节制（也就是还没有学会胡风分子那一套反革命的两面派伎俩），现在已经不可收拾（即受到党的处分）了，我了解你，衷心地同情你，你还是到我这儿来吧。这里，阴险的反革命分子，便向许君鲸伸出了罪恶的血手，而坚持自由主义错误立场的许君鲸，也就这样给反革命分子的血手抓住，不再能正视自己的错误，离开了党，投靠到反革命分子那边去了。
    从此，胡风分子们就借指导创作之名，进一步拉拢了许君鲸。一九五○年，许君鲸在对党越来越疏远、对胡风分子越来越亲密的情况下，写了一首长诗“工人们”，请欧阳庄提意见，欧阳庄便将许的诗转给胡风及路翎、化铁等胡风分子看，以后又将胡风对诗的
  “意见”转给许。胡风在信里写道：“看出来作者有一股热情，但情绪平直，无波动，缺乏变化，没有节奏的主要原因要深入到历史内容中去吸取……望他继续写下去。”这就是说，许君鲸的诗，还未能完全适应胡风分子的要求，但胡风对许君鲸是有“希望”的，因为他“有一股热情”，所以“望他继续写下去”。
    我们可以看到，胡风和胡风集团的骨干分子是多么“关心”犯了错误的共产党员，他们对许君鲸这样一个“可能斗志较差”的人，在受处分后不到两年的过程中，就动员了他们集团中的骨干分子欧阳庄、路翎等，来“体谅”他的“心情”，“关心”他的“身体”，灌输同党对抗、反抗党的“理论”；甚至还由胡风亲自出马，来对许表示“希望”，
  “指导”许的“创作”。其结果，正如许君鲸自己说的：“这一帮别有用心的家伙，给我鼓励，给我指示，给我支持，使我陷入不可自拔的泥坑，成为胡风反革命集团的一分子。”一九五四年欧阳庄介绍另一个胡风集团分子同许见面时，信上已把许称为“自己人”了。
    许君鲸成了胡风集团的“自己人”后，也就在自己工作的地方经常散布胡风集团的反革命“理论”，向胡风集团提供“争取人”、“联络人”的线索，并进行了许多反党的活动。当胡风反革命集团的“意见书”印发，党报上展开批评后，许竟“气愤”地给欧阳庄写信道：“骑士先生们（指革命的文艺批评工作者）又驰骋起来了，干巴巴的几句教条，怕不能使空气芬芳起来的（指正确的批评起不了作用），我不爱看热闹的假面舞会（诬蔑批评是错误的，虚伪的），我在看‘牡丹亭’……”到这时，他说话的腔调已经和胡风一模一样了，他不但“有一股热情”，而且更敢于反抗“现实”，情绪“波动”而有“节奏”了。这是胡风集团多方
  “培养”的结果，是反革命分子的胜利，但对于坚持自由主义立场的许君鲸来说，可真是“放任至不可收拾”了。
    许君鲸被胡风反革命集团拖下水的这件事，充分说明了“人民日报”在“关于胡风反革命集团的材料”中对欧阳庄给胡风的这封信的按语的正确性。“人民日报”按语说：“共产党员的自由主义倾向受到了批判，胡风分子就叫做‘受了打击’，如果这人‘斗志较差’，即并不坚持自由主义立场，而愿意接受党的批判转到正确立场上来的话，对于胡风集团来说，那就无望了，他们就拉不走这个人。如果这人坚持自由主义立场的‘斗志’不是‘较差’而是‘较好’的话，那末，这人就有被拉走的危险。”正因为许君鲸是坚持自由主义立场“斗志较好”的人，所以他在胡风集团“一试”之下，便被拉走了。
