Developing Public-Private Joint Industrial Enterprises in Shanghai

In Shanghai, 235 private industrial enterprises, accounting for nearly one-third of the total output value, have implemented public-private joint ownership. Factories accounting for over 90% of the current output value of large-scale private industry have accepted state processing orders or purchase and sales arrangements. These include heavy industries such as steel smelting, copper casting, sand casting, electrical equipment, machine manufacturing, electricity, kiln industry, and cement, as well as light industries such as textiles, rubber, paper making, and pharmaceuticals.

Since the implementation of public-private joint ownership, many factories have gradually changed their business management, established systems such as production responsibility, production planning, and production meetings, reversing the past phenomena of long-term delayed deliveries and perennial losses. Many factories have also begun to trial-produce new products, with many extremely important new products being trial-produced according to models from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other countries.

The implementation of public-private joint ownership in these two hundred-plus factories in Shanghai has played a significant role in the country's production and construction and in people's lives. Currently, the workers and staff of these factories are universally launching an increase production and practice economy movement centered on improving product quality and reducing production costs, to further contribute more to the country's production and construction.

The jointly owned Dalong Machine Factory frequently receives assistance from Soviet experts after the joint ownership. This Soviet expert goes deep into the factory's workshops to understand production conditions and provide specific guidance.

The jointly owned Xinhe Cotton Mill has improved the temperature, humidity, dust absorption, lighting, and other labor protection facilities in each workshop after the joint ownership. All four main workshops in the factory have been equipped with cold air cooling equipment.

Since its joint ownership, the jointly owned Xin'an Motor Factory has successfully trial-produced thirty-eight new products, fifteen of which were manufactured according to Soviet designs. This worker is inspecting the quality of the Soviet-style "magnetic starter" manufactured for Anshan Iron and Steel.

The jointly owned Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory overfulfilled the state plan in the first half of this year. Currently, all the factory's workers and staff are striving to save 360 tons of rubber throughout the year. These tires, after inspection and storage, will be supplied to meet the needs of various regions.

    发展中的上海市公私合营工业企业
    上海市私营工业已有占产值近三分之一的二百三十五个工厂实行了公私合营，占目前私营大型工业产值百分之九十以上的工厂，接受了国家的加工订货或收购包销。其中有钢铁冶炼、铜料冶铸、翻砂制造、电工器材、机器制造、电力、窑业、水泥等重工业方面的企业，也有纺织、橡胶、造纸、制药等轻工业方面的企业。
    许多工厂在公私合营后，逐步改变了经营管理，建立了生产责任制、生产计划和生产会议等制度，改变了过去长期脱期交货和历年亏损的现象。不少工厂还开始试制新产品，许多极重要的新产品是按照苏联、捷克斯洛伐克等国的式样试制的。
    上海市这两百多个工厂实行公私合营后，对国家的生产建设和人民生活都起了很大的作用。现在，这些工厂的职工正普遍展开以提高产品质量和降低生产成本为中心的增产节约运动，以进一步为国家生产建设作出更多的贡献。　本报　王志渊摄
