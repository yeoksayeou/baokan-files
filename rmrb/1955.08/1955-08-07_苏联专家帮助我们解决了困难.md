    Soviet Experts Helped Us Solve Difficulties

    Editor:

    In January of this year, the casting workshop of our Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory received the task of manufacturing a "electrode chuck" (also called "copper shell") for a new three-ton electric furnace. This is a complex casting, and we lacked experience in copper casting. Therefore, the administrative leadership specially assigned technical personnel to study relevant technical data, and together with the workers, they compiled special process cards, and also assigned a veteran worker of the seventh grade to operate. However, three pieces in a row were made with poor quality. After repair welding, two pieces could barely be used, and the other piece had to be scrapped.

    In mid-March, the leadership selected experienced veteran workers to participate in the operation, and the technical personnel and workers repeatedly studied the process regulations and operating methods, but the products manufactured were still defective. We also went to the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Factory to learn from their experience, but because the products were different, the problem still could not be solved. In this way, six pieces were manufactured one after another, and all were scrapped. This not only caused losses to state property; but more seriously, other parts of the three-ton electric furnace were completed, and this one part was missing. If the problem could not be solved, the entire product would not be able to leave the factory on schedule, affecting the production of fraternal factories.

    It was at this time that Soviet expert Gerkusa arrived at our factory. On May 25th, the workshop director and technical personnel went to the expert for advice. After the expert clarified the casting process and the situation of the scrapped products, carefully looked at the past defective products, and then analyzed them, he proposed the opinion of re-compiling the process regulations. When the expert's suggestion was conveyed to the workers in the workshop, the workers were extremely excited, and everyone conscientiously prepared for the work according to the expert's instructions. When casting began on June 9th, the expert came to the workshop to check the model and the closing of the box, and personally guided the pouring. The next day, the expert came to see the results of the cast product. Sure enough, the product produced was completely up to standard.

    This fact has educated all the staff in our workshop to further realize the importance of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union for our socialist construction. Everyone is determined to learn from the Soviet Union more seriously and do a good job in production in the future.

### 苏联专家帮助我们解决了困难

    苏联专家帮助我们解决了困难编辑同志：
    今年一月份，我们太原重型机器厂铸工车间接到一项制造新产品三吨电炉的“电极夹头”（也叫“铜外壳”）的任务。这是一种复杂的铸件，我们又缺乏铸铜经验，因此，行政领导方面特地派技术人员研究有关技术资料，同工人一起编制专门的工艺卡，还派了一位七级老工人担任操作。但是一连做了三件，都是质量不好。经过补焊，有两件能勉强凑合着用，另一件只能报废了。
    三月中旬，领导方面又选出对铸铜造型有经验的老工人参加操作，技术人员同工人一起多次研究工艺规程和操作方法，但是制造出来的仍然都是废品。我们又专门到太原钢铁厂去学习了经验，因为产品不一样，结果仍然不能解决问题。这样，先后制造了六件，全部报废了。这不但使国家财产遭到了损失；而更严重的是三吨电炉别的零件都完成了，就差这一样不能装齐。如果问题再解决不了，将使整个产品不能按期出厂，影响兄弟厂的生产。
    就在这个时候，苏联专家葛尔库萨到了我们工厂。五月二十五日，车间主任和技术人员去找专家请教。专家问清了我们铸造的经过和报废的情形，仔细地看了过去的废品，接着就进行分析，提出了重新编制工艺规程的意见。当专家的建议在车间中向工人们传达以后，工人们都兴奋极了，大家认真地按照专家的指示作好了准备工作。六月九日开始铸造时，专家又下车间来检查了模型和合箱，并且亲自指导浇注。第二天，专家又来看铸造的产品结果。果然，生产出来的是完全合乎规格标准的产品。
    这件事实，教育了我们车间全体职工进一步认识到学习苏联先进经验对我们社会主义建设的重要意义，大家都决心今后更要认真学习苏联，搞好生产。
