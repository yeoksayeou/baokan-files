Xinhua News Agency, August 31st. Approximately 80,000 Muslims in Beijing joyfully celebrated Eid al-Adha today.

Muslims from Niujie, Tianqiao, Chaoyangmenwai, and other areas, along with Muslims from across the city, gathered at 67 mosques to celebrate the festival. The Dongsi Pailou Mosque was exceptionally clean, with lush flowers and plants in the courtyard, and pearl plums in full bloom. More than 400 Muslims, including representatives from the National People's Congress, residents, government officials, and students, held "congregational prayers" here.

In various mosques and many Muslim homes, people cheerfully slaughtered cattle and sheep, some distributing the meat to their neighbors and fellow Muslims. Deng Wenbin, a Hui resident, was previously unemployed and his family lacked sufficient food and clothing. After liberation, both he and his son found work and their lives have improved. Today, his family slaughtered a sheep. In recent years, more than 8,000 Hui people in the city, like Deng Wenbin, have found employment in factories, mines, and other enterprises.

Today, many Muslims also went to the tomb of the Hui martyr Ma Jun to pay their respects, mourning this outstanding Chinese Communist Party member who sacrificed his life in 1928.

    北京八万名伊斯兰教信徒欢庆古尔邦节
    新华社三十一日讯　北京约八万名伊斯兰教信徒，今天愉快地度过古尔邦节。
    牛街，天桥和朝阳门外等地的回民和全市的伊斯兰教徒，聚集在六十七座清真寺庆祝了这个节日。东四牌楼清真寺打扫得异常清净，院内花草繁茂，珍珠梅正在盛开。四百多个伊斯兰教徒在这里举行“聚礼”，他们中间有全国人民代表大会的代表，有居民，有机关干部和学生。
    在各清真寺和许多回民的家里，人们喜气洋洋地宰杀了牛羊，有的将牛羊肉分送给左邻右舍的教友们。回民邓文斌过去没有职业，全家衣食无着。解放后，他和儿子已有了工作，生活得到改善。今天他家宰了一只羊。几年来全市已有八千多个回民，像邓文斌一样在厂矿和企业等单位就业。
    今天，还有许多回民前往回族烈士马骏墓前致哀，悼念这位一九二八年牺牲的优秀的中国共产党员。
