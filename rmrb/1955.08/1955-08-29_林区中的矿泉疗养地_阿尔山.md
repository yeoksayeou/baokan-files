　　Arxan: A Mineral Spring Resort in the Forest Area

      From Ulanhot, the red city of Inner Mongolia, take the train north along the Bai'a Line for about twelve hours, passing through the spine of the Greater Khingan Mountains, and you will reach Arxan, a town in the heart of the boundless "sea of trees." The climate here is cool. Even during the dog days of summer, the temperature is only around 20 degrees Celsius. It is a scenic forest town and a sanatorium with concentrated mineral springs.
    Every year after the summer heat, people from far and wide flock here to bathe in the mineral springs. There are herdsmen who drive sheep and pull Mongolian yurts from the Hulunbuir and Horqin grasslands, as well as distant guests who come by train and car from thousands of miles away.
    At the foot of the Eastern Mountain, five hundred meters from Arxan Station, stand rows of red and white bathhouses. There are forty-eight mineral springs here. The clear, emerald green water, containing a large amount of minerals, gushes out continuously. Although these mineral springs are densely distributed within an area of less than half a kilometer, their temperatures and medicinal effects are different. The hottest spring, No. 3, has a temperature of 46 degrees Celsius, while the coldest spring, No. 1, is only around 2 degrees Celsius. Mineral spring water is very effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis, neurasthenia, skin diseases, stomach problems, and general gynecological diseases.
    Paggba, a patient with arthritis from the Xilingol Grassland, told me that when he arrived half a month ago, he was still using two crutches, but now he only needs one. He hopes that when he returns home in a few days, he will be able to walk without any support.
    In 1948, the Logistics and Health Department of the Northeast Military Region established a sanatorium here. Many warriors who shed blood and were wounded for the cause of the liberation of the motherland came here to recuperate. The blue high-rise building next to the mineral spring is the Inner Mongolia Workers' Second Sanatorium. Every year, a large number of forestry workers and state organ staff from the Inner Mongolia forest area and other places are admitted for recuperation.
    The herdsmen who come here for summer recuperation can also enjoy a rich cultural life. They can listen to various programs broadcast by the Central and Inner Mongolia People's Broadcasting Stations. Every weekend, young herdsmen go to the club to dance and have fun with the forestry workers.
    When night falls and the nomadic people's mobile school is over, young men and women herdsmen admire the sparkling electric lights and the stars reflected on the river, look at the towering peaks and the lush forests all over the mountains, and sing heartily and joyfully about the beautiful and prosperous motherland.

　　林区中的矿泉疗养地——阿尔山
　　扎·葆聿
      从内蒙古红色的城——乌兰浩特坐火车沿着白阿线北上，约走十二个小时，穿过大兴安岭脊背，就到广漠无边的“树海”腹地阿尔山。这里气候凉爽，在夏日炎炎的三伏天，温度也不过摄氏二十度左右，是个风光明媚的林区小镇，也是矿泉密集的疗养胜地。
    每年暑伏以后，远近赶来到矿泉沐浴的人络绎不绝。有自呼伦贝尔科尔沁草原赶着羊群、拉着蒙古包来的牧民，也有乘火车、汽车，不远千里而来的远方客人。
    离阿尔山车站五百公尺的东山脚下，排列着一座座红色的和白色的浴室。这里有四十八眼矿泉。潺潺不息地涌出含有大量矿物质的碧绿澄澈的水。这些矿泉群虽然密布在周围不到一华里的地区内，但它的温度和医疗效能各有不同。水温最高的三号泉有摄氏四十六度，最低的一号泉只有摄氏二度上下。矿泉水治疗风湿性关节炎、神经衰弱、皮肤病、胃病，以及一般妇科病的效果都很好。
    来自锡林郭勒草原的关节炎患者帕格巴告诉我：半月前他来时还扶着双拐杖，现在只剩一条拐杖，再过些日子回家的时候，就有希望可以甩手走路了。
    一九四八年东北军区后勤卫生部在这里设立一座疗养院，为祖国解放事业流血负伤的不少勇士，曾来休养过。紧靠矿泉的一座青色的高楼就是内蒙古工人第二疗养院。每年都有来自内蒙古林区和各地的大批林业工人和国家机关工作人员入院疗养。
    到这里度伏疗养的牧民们也都能享受丰富的文化生活。他们可以听到中央和内蒙古人民广播电台播送的各种节目，每到周末，青年牧民就到俱乐部同林业职工联欢、跳舞。
    夜晚来临，游动民校的学习结束了的时候，青年男女牧民，欣赏着闪闪发光的电灯和倒映在河面上的繁星，望着高耸入云的山峰和满山遍野的茂密森林，尽情、愉快地歌唱美丽和富饶的祖国。
