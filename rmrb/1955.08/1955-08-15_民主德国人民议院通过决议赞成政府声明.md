    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 13th: The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, on August 12th, after hearing the government statement by the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl, regarding the Geneva Four-Power Heads of Government Conference and its impact on Germany, unanimously passed a resolution expressing full agreement with the statement.
    The resolution stated that the People's Chamber particularly welcomed the agreements reached between the Soviet government delegation and the German Democratic Republic government on further deepening and expanding political, economic, and cultural cooperation between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic.
    The resolution considered that the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany should contribute to ensuring European security, thereby promoting the resolution of the German reunification issue. The resolution stated that the German Democratic Republic is prepared to participate in the European security treaty proposed by the Soviet government delegation at the Geneva Conference.
    The resolution welcomed the Four-Power Heads of Government's instruction to the Four Foreign Ministers to invite representatives of the two Germanies to participate in discussions on the German question. The People's Chamber hoped that West Germany would value the fact that the Four-Power Heads of Government had granted them the right to defend the national interests of the German people.
    The resolution concluded by stating that the People's Chamber is prepared to take various measures, and requests that all social organizations and the government of the German Democratic Republic also take similar measures, to ease the German situation and promote the early realization of the German people's goal—to make a unified Germany a truly peaceful and democratic Germany. To this end, the People's Chamber particularly welcomed the Prime Minister's statement on measures for close cooperation among all Germans in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life.
