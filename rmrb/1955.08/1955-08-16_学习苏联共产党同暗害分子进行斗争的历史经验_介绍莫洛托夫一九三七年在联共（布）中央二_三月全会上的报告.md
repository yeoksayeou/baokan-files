Learning from the Historical Experience of the Soviet Communist Party in the Struggle Against Saboteurs
    —Introducing Molotov's Report at the February-March 1937 Plenary Session of the CPSU(B) Central Committee
    Xiong Fu
    The "Economic Translation Series" successively published in the seventh and eighth issues of 1955 the report by Comrade Molotov at the February-March 1937 Plenary Session of the CPSU(B) Central Committee: "Lessons Must Be Drawn from the Sabotage, Destructive and Espionage Activities of the Trotskyist-Fascist Gangs."
    We know from the history of the Soviet Communist Party that the great Soviet Communist Party, in leading the Soviet people in the cause of socialist construction, had to wage fierce struggles against all open and hidden counter-revolutionaries. They achieved great victories in building socialism by eliminating the Zinovievites, Trotskyists, and Bukharinites who carried out sabotage activities. Comrade Molotov's report, with practical knowledge of class struggle, most fully elaborated the lessons of the Soviet Communist Party's struggle against the Trotskyists at that time. This report is still of great practical significance to all members of the Chinese Communist Party and revolutionary workers, because we are also waging a struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries to defend the cause of socialist construction, and we must also draw the fullest lessons from this struggle.
    I
    In the first part of his report, Comrade Molotov exposed the faces of this heinous sabotage gang with many facts of the Trotskyists' sabotage activities.
    He first pointed out that although the Soviet Union's first Five-Year Plan had been successfully completed and the second Five-Year Plan was nearing its successful completion, it was still necessary to pay serious attention to the consequences of the sabotage activities carried out by the Trotskyist-Fascist gangs. Comrade Molotov said: "The enemy wants to strike at the most important and vital parts of the national economy and national defense." At that time, the sabotage activities of the Trotskyist gangs caused serious losses to the Soviet national economy, especially heavy industry.
    The report mentioned the destructive activities of Pyatakov, the main organizer of the Trotskyist gangs in the heavy industry sector. According to Pyatakov's confession, he was ordered by Trotsky to organize counter-revolutionary activities in the most vital parts of the socialist economy. Pyatakov took advantage of his leadership position in the People's Commissariat of Heavy Industry to collect and place a large number of saboteurs and spies, including hundreds of economic leaders holding party membership and non-party engineers and technicians occupying important positions, to carry out the most despicable and vicious sabotage activities.
    Comrade Molotov quoted the confessions of the Trotskyists to prove that all departments of heavy industry, including the chemical industry, the coal mining industry, the metallurgical industry, and the non-ferrous metals industry, had Trotskyists carrying out sabotage activities. The patterns of their sabotage activities were diverse, the means were despicable and shameless, and they showed their deep-seated hatred for the Soviet people and the Soviet regime. The sabotage activities of the Trotskyists were carried out on a large scale, from dispersing and stagnating funds, systematically disrupting designs, trying every means to delay the progress of new construction and reconstruction projects, to organizing production accidents, damaging production equipment, disrupting labor organization, creating explosions, arson and poisoning, killing advanced producers, and obstructing the Stakhanov movement. Comrade Molotov pointed out: "We must not forget that these crimes are only their preparatory work, a check on their own strength, so that they can carry out greater and more insidious attacks on our country in the future. According to the deployment of Trotsky and Pyatakov, the spy saboteurs were prepared to launch the main attack when the war broke out. If this group of Japanese-German-Trotskyist lackeys were not exposed by then, there would be major difficulties in completing military tasks and economic tasks in the early stages of the war."
    Comrade Molotov also quoted the confessions of the saboteurs to prove that the saboteurs not only carried out rampant sabotage activities in the heavy industry sector, but also in other sectors of the national economy, such as light industry, transportation, forestry, urban construction, and food supply for residents. He pointed out that "all these things not only happened in front of some loyal economic workers and engineers, but also in front of our party organizations and trade union organizations, these people and organizations either do not understand the significance of these facts happening in front of us, or are not good at fighting these facts." He further pointed out that "the lessons we have learned seem to be many, and they are enough to make us realize that saboteurs and wreckers are trying their best to find a hidden place in various economic departments and all state organs, and use the indifferent attitude of our leaders who are growing complacent to do their dirty deeds."
    Comrade Molotov used these sabotage facts to expose that the Trotskyists were a group of heinous gangs who had degenerated into fighting the Soviet regime by all means. He quoted the Shakhty affair from 1928 to 1930 to prove that from the destructive activities of the Industrial Party in the Shakhty affair to the sabotage activities of the Trotskyist gangs, the enemy had changed. The enemies exposed in the Shakhty affair "were enemies from the bourgeois camp, enemies from the bourgeois experts," "they did not pretend to be our friends." And the characteristics of the sabotage activities of the Trotskyist gangs are: "Party members, people from our party now play an active role in sabotage and destructive organizations. The current sabotage and destructive organizations are particularly dangerous because these saboteurs, wreckers and spies are communists, ardent supporters of the Soviet regime, and even often people who have made some contributions to the party and the Soviet state in the past." "They use communists as a cover, pretend to be our friends, and lurk in important positions in the Soviet state and party organizations, so as to easily carry out heinous sabotage activities." He pointed out that this group of Trotskyists who pretended to be revolutionaries had actually become saboteurs and murdering gangs serving foreign countries and carrying out the tasks entrusted by the fascist detective agencies in the Soviet Union. Not only the Trotskyists, but all the Bukharinites and Rykovites were also such saboteurs and murdering gangs.
    Comrade Molotov concluded from these sabotage facts that "our primary task is to understand these facts and truly carry out the struggle against sabotage activities and saboteurs in a Bolshevik way." That is to say, to "find out what shortcomings in the management organs and what shortcomings in our work have facilitated the treacherous activities of the Trotskyists and other saboteurs, and facilitated the destructive activities of these spies and other spies from foreign espionage agencies in our economic organs, enterprises, mines, railways, power stations, and our state organs."
    It is not difficult to understand that everything Comrade Molotov said here is also worth our deep consideration. Here with us, there are also counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. Their sabotage activities are also becoming more and more despicable and shameless, and have already caused major damage to our construction cause. Their evil hands have also stretched into all departments of our national economy and state organs, and they also want to strike us in the most important and vital parts of our socialist construction, in order to realize their dreams of counter-revolutionary restoration. Their characteristic is also to deceive us with various disguises, sneak into our interior and hide, and carry out covert and double-dealing sabotage activities. Their sabotage activities also happened in front of all people who are loyal to the cause of socialism, in front of our party organizations, state organs, and mass organizations, but many of us turn a blind eye to such facts, showing shameful phenomena of political numbness, ignorance and short-sightedness. All the facts of counter-revolutionary activities that have been exposed, especially the Gao-Rao anti-Party alliance incident, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique incident, and the Pan Hannian counter-revolutionary crime incident, have also been enough to make us draw the lessons we should: sharpen our eyes, heighten our vigilance, and truly fight against all open and hidden counter-revolutionaries in a Bolshevik way.
    II
    In the second part of his report, Comrade Molotov elaborated and demonstrated in detail the tasks of fighting against the Trotskyists and other saboteurs, wreckers, and spies. He pointed out that special attention must be paid to three issues: cadre education, staff selection, and leadership methods.
    Regarding the issue of cadre education, Comrade Molotov first described the great achievements made by the Party in cultivating its own Bolshevik technical cadres since the Shakhty affair. Since then, the Bolshevik technical cadres have grown greatly, and have basically mastered the business, and realized the slogan of "mastering technology and production." However, Comrade Molotov pointed out that "in the execution of the task of mastering technology, many one-sided situations arose that were harmful to the Bolshevik education of cadres," that is, many workers, although they mastered the technology, lagged behind in their political development, they fell into the circles of narrow businessism, narrow economic views, detachment from the Party's political tasks, and all the political myopia that came from this, fell into the quagmire of vulgar ideas of peace and political paralysis, and fell into the complacency and self-satisfaction that were incompatible with Bolshevik qualities due to enthusiasm for achievements.
    Comrade Molotov incisively explained the slogan "Bolsheviks should master technology." He said, "Obviously, what is meant here is that Bolsheviks master technology, and the Party calls on economic workers to master technology in the spirit of Bolshevism." It is not the Party's requirement to master technology on the one hand and lower one's Bolshevik qualities on the other. What the Party requires is to master technology in a complete sense, that is, to further strengthen one's Bolshevik qualities while mastering technology. According to such requirements, Comrade Molotov proposed that first, one must be familiar with one's own business. He said, "This requirement for our leading cadres cannot be lowered in any way. On the contrary, the lessons of sabotage, destruction and espionage activities of the Trotskyists and foreign lackeys who have repeatedly fooled our economic leaders require us to fight more tenaciously to master technology." In order to truly master technology, one must learn, "not only from friends, but also from enemies." "Learn from everyone who can be learned from." Second, one must promote the spirit of self-criticism. He said that without promoting a true spirit of self-criticism, "it is impossible to truly push our cadres forward," "and there is no hope of catching up with and surpassing advanced capitalist countries in technology." In order to master all the achievements of modern technology more quickly, one must never be satisfied with the existing achievements, but must conduct detailed inspection and strict criticism of the achievements, and find out why there are still many places in technology and production that are far behind advanced countries, behind their level of labor productivity, behind their production quotas and work quality. And as long as the two qualities of being familiar with business and being good at self-criticism are combined, it will be possible to eliminate all saboteurs on the road to advancement and ensure that all modern technology and production indicators are achieved. Third, one must be loyal to the country. He pointed out that under the circumstances that the petty-bourgeois habits in the staff of state organs are still stubborn, and there are still phenomena such as stealing state property and falsely reporting work achievements, it is necessary to educate cadres with the spirit of being truly loyal and honest to the country. He said, "In order to seek faster promotion and temporary honor, sometimes those economic workers who are not too bad also pretend and deceive the country. And around these ambitious leaders, one can find a group of flatterers and slaves, behind whom it is very easy to hide all kinds of saboteurs and villains." Fourth, one must raise vigilance against the enemy. He said, "We cannot fail to consider the fact that our class enemies are adopting new, more cunning, and more hidden methods of struggle. This requires our leaders to be good at recognizing and exposing these new tricks of the enemy. To this end, it is necessary to broaden the political horizons of our cadres and cultivate their vigilance against the enemy, so that they can recognize any disguised enemy. Only in this way, only with this Bolshevik quality, can our economic workers and other workers be called true leaders."
    Comrade Molotov concluded on this issue that leaders must pay attention to the political education of cadres and cultivate and strengthen the Bolshevik qualities of cadres. "Without doing this, leaders cannot be leaders, but are bureaucrats, bureaucrats, in short, they can be anything, but they are not Bolshevik representatives in important positions."
    Regarding the issue of staff selection, Comrade Molotov pointed out that in view of the lessons of sabotage activities, this issue is of paramount importance. He said that seriously allocating and selecting cadres is a Bolshevik responsibility that leaders cannot evade. This responsibility is: "One should be familiar with one's own staff, one should supervise their work, check their work, one should criticize backward staff, replace incompetent and already bureaucratic staff, one should pay attention to discovering new staff, and actively help promote them." Comrade Molotov demonstrated the criteria for selecting staff. "The criteria for selecting staff can only be professional ability and political qualities, and leaders should be familiar with these two aspects of cadres, and not by listening to rumors or written materials, but seriously based on daily observations in work, and regular inspections of their work." He emphasized, "Leaders must be responsible for their own cadres. To examine leaders, one must first examine whether they are good at using staff, and whether they are good at selecting cadres based on both professional ability and political qualities. ... If our leaders do not recognize the important responsibility they bear for this work, then they have not drawn the due lessons from the exposed destruction, espionage, and sabotage schemes of the Trotskyist gangs."
    Regarding the issue of leadership methods, Comrade Molotov first pointed out that the Trotskyists, wreckers, and spies had used the bureaucratic distortion of the principle of one-man leadership in economic organs in many ways to carry out their evil schemes. The so-called bureaucratic distortion of one-man leadership is to oppose the leader himself to other staff, thinking that he can be free from the social supervision of the masses and ordinary economic workers, detached from the Party and non-Party activists, and not regard them as his main pillars. Comrade Molotov demonstrated the Bolshevik spirit of the principle of one-man leadership, which is to promote work, expose shortcomings in work, expose and eliminate all saboteurs with the help and support of Party and non-Party activists. He said, "Economic leadership has become so complicated, and the scope of economic leaders' responsibilities has expanded to such an extent that leadership work cannot be done without the help and support of activists." "Production and economic activists are the most important pillars of leaders." Therefore, "it is necessary to eliminate the bureaucratic distortion in leadership work, strengthen this struggle, and organize economic and production activists in the Bolshevik spirit."
    It is not difficult to understand that everything Comrade Molotov said here also deserves our serious attention. Here with us, the task of fighting against all counter-revolutionaries is also like this: we must strengthen the political education of cadres, use mastering business, promoting the spirit of self-criticism, holding a loyal and honest attitude to the Party and the country, and raising vigilance against the enemy to educate our cadres, improve their political awareness, broaden their political horizons, and make them cadres who are proficient in business and have Bolshevik qualities; we must seriously and conscientiously allocate and select cadres in accordance with the Bolshevik principles, that is, in accordance with the standards of professional ability and political qualities, pay attention to supervising and examining cadres in daily work, boldly and resolutely promote new forces who have been politically tested, are loyal to the Party, loyal to the country, and loyal to the cause of socialism to leadership positions; we must improve our leadership methods, thoroughly eradicate the bad habits of bureaucracy from our leadership organs and leadership staff, implement our Party's mass line—from the masses, to the masses, and rely on the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses to promote all our work. Only in this way can we eliminate all counter-revolutionaries on our road to advancement and ensure that our socialist cause achieves great victories.
    III
    In the concluding part of his report, Comrade Molotov profoundly elucidated the laws of class struggle and the class struggle situation in the Soviet Union at that time.
    He pointed out that the Party's traitors—the Trotskyists and the rightists—had turned to the bourgeoisie's sabotage, destruction, and espionage activities, but they were only the remnants of the bourgeois society. New, skilled, and loyal experts to the Soviet regime were rapidly and massively growing, and the development of the Stakhanov movement and the expansion of the Stakhanov workers' ranks reflected the unparalleled growth of the entire working class in the Soviet Union. However, he warned that complacency must not be allowed, because at that time, the Soviet Union had not yet completed the task of catching up with and surpassing advanced capitalist countries in technology, and clearing saboteurs, wreckers, spies, and other dirty things from industrial and entire state organs was one of the most important prerequisites for accelerating the completion of this task.
    He pointed out that the sabotage, destruction, and espionage activities of the Trotskyists and all their accomplices proved that their strength had weakened to the point of being unable to openly oppose the Soviet regime, and the reason why they had to adopt the method of double-dealing and hidden activities was not because they did not want to attack openly, but because the strength of the socialist system was stronger than their strength. "They are afraid of the light, so they play the tricks of double-dealing, pretending to be obedient and even pretending to be loyal to the Soviet regime." However, Comrade Molotov warned again that political indifference must not be adopted towards sabotage activities. "Even if there is still a double-dealing saboteur among us, we should not forget this danger, we should not be complacent, and we should not think that everything is fine because the masses are following us."
    He pointed out that the exposure of the sabotage, destruction, and espionage activities of the Japanese-German-Trotskyist lackeys also proved the acuteness and seriousness of the struggle between capitalism and socialism. He said that the enemy had adopted all means of struggle to oppose socialism, and the former communists had rolled to the most degenerate situation due to their instability and wavering—colluding with the fascists and carrying out sabotage activities that were beneficial to them, betraying and selling out their motherland at all costs. "Strikes must be answered with strikes, and the ranks of these spies and saboteurs from the fascist camp who appear on our road to advancement must be eliminated." However, Comrade Molotov emphasized again that the intensification of the struggle situation showed that the enemy's cause was irretrievable and they had fallen into pessimism and despair, but it also showed that we should further improve our revolutionary vigilance, socialist organization, and Bolshevik party spirit.
    He pointed out that it was not surprising that some of yesterday's fellow travelers had joined the enemy's camp, turned into fascist lackeys, and became counter-revolutionary gangs. He said that the Soviet Union was still surrounded by capitalism, and the greater the construction achievements of the Soviet Union, the more the class enemies hated it. They could find many ways to make people who were permeated with bourgeois prejudices and did not believe in the revolutionary strength of the working people leave the revolutionary camp and go over to the enemy. "The imminent approach of new and huge revolutionary events on the basis of the socialist victory in the Soviet Union inspires the workers of all countries to fight for liberation, but it also makes people who are permeated with bourgeois prejudices and do not believe in the strength of the working class panic. The Trotskyists' and Bukharinites' joining the bourgeois camp and becoming saboteurs, wreckers, murderers, and espionage gangs proves this."
    Comrade Molotov finally taught that we should not forget that the Soviet Union was competing with the capitalist system, the scale of the struggle was expanding, and the capitalist countries were taking measures to prepare for a new war, and the Trotskyists and other sabotage gangs were a team actively engaged in this preparation. "Forgetting this... is forgetting one's primary obligation to the people, to the working people." This obligation is to strive to win in this competition, and to this end, we must attract the broad masses of the people to step up socialist construction, and clear the enemies from the ranks of socialist builders.
    Of course, the specific environment of the class struggle we are in today is different from the environment in the Soviet Union at that time, but it is the same that we must understand the environment of the class struggle we are in today in accordance with the laws of class struggle. It is precisely on this point that Comrade Molotov's report has great educational significance for us. To understand the environment we are in in accordance with the laws of class struggle, we should see that we are still surrounded by imperialism, and they will never sit idly by in our construction cause; at the same time, the overthrown Kuomintang reactionaries and the eliminated landlord class are not willing to die, and they will never not carry out sabotage activities in our construction cause; and the bourgeoisie that will be eliminated will not automatically withdraw from the stage of history, and they will never not resist socialist transformation; and the resolute counter-revolutionaries in the classes that have been eliminated and will be eliminated will inevitably collude with imperialism and jointly carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. This is the social reason why counter-revolutionary sabotage activities have become more and more rampant since we began to enter the stage of planned socialist construction and systematic socialist transformation. The struggle against all open and hidden counter-revolutionaries has become the most acute manifestation of class struggle in our country today. The task of our entire Party is not to disarm ourselves with the paralyzing thought that everything is going well, but to improve our political awareness and vigilance with the practical knowledge of class struggle, strengthen the unity of the entire Party under the unified leadership of the Central Committee, and at the same time strengthen the unity of the people of the whole country around the Party, mobilize the people of all ethnic groups in the country to carry out unremitting struggle, carry out our socialist construction cause in the struggle, and guarantee the victory of our socialist construction cause in the struggle!

    学习苏联共产党同暗害分子进行斗争的历史经验
    ——介绍莫洛托夫一九三七年在联共（布）中央二—三月全会上的报告
    熊复
    “经济译丛”一九五五年第七、八两期连续译载了莫洛托夫同志在一九三七年联共（布）中央二—三月全会上的报告：“必须从托洛茨基法西斯走狗的暗害、破坏和间谍事件中吸取教训”。
    我们从苏联共产党的历史知道，伟大的苏联共产党在领导苏联人民从事社会主义建设事业的过程中，曾不得不同一切公开的和暗藏的反革命分子进行剧烈的斗争。他们由于肃清了进行暗害活动的季诺维也夫分子、托洛茨基分子和布哈林分子而取得了建设社会主义的伟大胜利。莫洛托夫同志的报告，用阶级斗争的实际知识，最充分地阐述了当时苏联共产党同托洛茨基分子进行斗争的教训。这个报告，对于我们中国共产党的全体党员和革命工作人员，仍然具有重大的现实的意义，因为我们今天也正在为着保卫社会主义建设事业而进行肃清反革命分子的斗争，我们也必须从这个斗争中吸取最充分的教训。一
    莫洛托夫同志在他的报告的第一部分，用托洛茨基分子暗害活动的许多事实，揭露了这个万恶的暗害匪帮的面目。
    他首先指出，尽管当时苏联的第一个五年计划已经胜利完成，第二个五年计划已经接近胜利完成，仍然必须严重注意托洛茨基法西斯走狗所进行的暗害活动的后果。莫洛托夫同志说：“敌人是要在国民经济和国防方面选择最重要最要害的地方进行打击”。在那个时候，托洛茨基匪帮的暗害活动对于苏联的国民经济特别是重工业造成了严重的损失。
    报告中谈到托洛茨基匪帮在重工业部门进行暗害活动的主要组织者皮达可夫的破坏活动。根据皮达可夫的供词，他受托洛茨基之命在社会主义经济最要害的地方组织了反革命活动。皮达可夫利用了他窃据重工业人民委员部的领导职位，搜罗和安置了大批暗害分子和间谍分子，包括成百持有党证的经济领导者和窃据要职的非党工程师和技师，进行了最卑鄙最凶恶的暗害活动。
    莫洛托夫同志引证了托洛茨基分子的供词，证明重工业的各个部门，包括化学工业、采煤工业、冶金工业、有色金属工业，都有托洛茨基分子在其中进行暗害活动。他们进行暗害活动的花样是繁多的，手段是卑鄙无耻的，表现了他们对苏联人民和苏维埃政权抱着刻骨的仇恨。托洛茨基分子的暗害活动是在广大范围内进行的，从分散呆滞资金，有系统地打乱设计，想尽一切办法延缓新建工程和改建工程的进行，一直到组织生产事故，损坏生产设备，破坏劳动组织，制造爆炸事件，放火放毒，杀害先进生产者和阻碍斯达哈诺夫运动。莫洛托夫同志指出：“我们不能忘记，这些罪行还仅是他们的准备工作，是检查一下自己的力量，以便今后向我们国家进行更大的更阴险的打击。按照托洛茨基和皮达可夫的部署，间谍破坏分子是准备在战争爆发时进行主力打击的。假如这一批日本德国托洛茨基走狗到那时仍不被揭破，那末，在战争初期，在完成军事任务和经济任务方面必将遭到重大困难。”
    莫洛托夫同志还引证暗害分子的供词，证明暗害分子不仅在重工业部门，而且在国民经济的其他部门，如轻工业、交通运输业、森林工业、市政建设和居民食品供应等方面，都进行了猖狂的破坏活动。他指出，“所有这些事情，不仅发生在某些忠诚的经济工作人员和工程师面前，而且也发生在我们的党组织和工会组织面前，这些人们和组织不是不懂我们面前发生的这些事实的意义，就是不善于同这些事实做斗争。”进而指出，“我们取得的教训似乎已经很多了，已足能使我们认识到暗害分子和破坏分子极力想在各经济部门和一切国家机关中寻找一个隐蔽的地方，利用我们滋长着自满情绪的领导者的漠不关心的态度来干他们的肮脏勾当。”
    莫洛托夫同志引用这些暗害事实，揭露出托洛茨基分子是一群堕落成为不惜以一切手段同苏维埃政权进行斗争的万恶匪帮。他引证一九二八年—三○年的沙赫特事件，证明从沙赫特事件中工业党的破坏活动到托洛茨基匪帮的暗害活动，敌人已经有了变化。在沙赫特事件中被揭露的敌人，“是从资产阶级阵营里来的敌人，是从资产阶级专家那里来的敌人”，“他们并没有假装是我们的朋友”。而托洛茨基匪帮的暗害活动的特点则是：“持有党证者、我党出身者现在在暗害破坏组织中起积极的作用。现今的暗害破坏组织所以特别危险，就在于这些暗害分子、破坏分子和间谍是共产党员，是苏维埃政权的热烈拥护者，甚而往往是过去对党和苏维埃国家有过某些功绩的人。”“他们以共产党员做掩护，伪装是我们的朋友，潜伏在苏维埃国家和党组织的重要岗位上，以便易于进行万恶的破坏活动。”他指出，这群伪装革命的托洛茨基分子，实际上已经变成为外国服务的在苏联执行法西斯侦探机关委托的暗害分子和杀人匪帮。不只是托洛茨基分子，所有的布哈林分子和李可夫分子也都是这样的暗害分子和杀人匪帮。
    莫洛托夫同志从这些暗害事实得出结论说，“我们的首要任务就在于弄懂这些事实，真正按布尔什维克方式开展同暗害活动和暗害分子的斗争。”这也就是说，要“弄清管理机关里的哪些缺点，我们工作中的哪些缺点便利了托洛茨基分子及其他暗害分子进行背叛活动，便利了外国间谍机关的这些间谍和其他间谍在我们的经济机关、企业、矿井、铁路、电站和我们的国家机关里进行破坏活动。”
    不难了解，莫洛托夫同志在这里所说的这一切，其意义也是值得我们深长思之的。在我们这里，也有反革命分子的破坏活动。他们的破坏活动也越来越卑鄙无耻，并且已经对我们的建设事业造成了重大的损害。他们的罪恶之手也伸进了我们国民经济和国家机关的一切部门，他们也想在我国社会主义建设的最重要最要害的地方来打击我们，以便实现他们的反革命复辟的梦想。他们的特点也是用各种伪装来欺骗我们，钻进我们内部暗藏起来，进行隐蔽的和两面派的破坏活动。他们的破坏活动也是在所有忠于社会主义事业的人们的面前，在我们党组织、国家机关和群众团体面前发生的，而我们许多人却对这种事实熟视无睹，表现了政治上的麻木不仁和昏庸短视的可耻现象。所有已被揭发出来的反革命活动的事实，特别是高、饶反党联盟事件、胡风反革命集团事件和潘汉年反革命罪行事件，也都已足够使我们吸取应有的教训：擦亮我们的眼睛，提高我们的警惕，真正按照布尔什维克的方式来同一切公开的和暗藏的反革命分子进行斗争。二莫洛托夫同志在他的报告的第二部分，详尽地阐述了和论证了同托洛茨基分子和其他暗害者、破坏者、间谍作斗争的任务。他指出必须特别注意干部教育、工作人员的选择和领导方法三个问题。
    关于干部教育问题，莫洛托夫同志首先叙述了自从沙赫特事件以来，党在培养自己的布尔什维克技术干部方面的重大成就。从那时以来，布尔什维克的技术干部已有很大的成长，并且已经基本上掌握了业务，实现了“精通技术和生产”的口号。但是，莫洛托夫同志指出，“在执行掌握技术的任务中，产生了许多片面的，有害于布尔什维克的干部教育的情况”，即许多工作人员虽然掌握了技术，却在自己的政治发展上落后了，他们陷进了狭隘的事务主义、狭隘的经济观点、脱离党的政治任务以及由此一切而来的政治上近视等等圈子里，掉进了庸俗的太平观念和政治上麻痹的泥沼，陷入了由于热中于成绩而产生的那种同布尔什维克品质不相容的沾沾自喜和自满情绪之中。
    莫洛托夫同志精辟地解释了“布尔什维克应该掌握技术”这个口号。他说，“很明显，这里指的是布尔什维克掌握技术，是党号召经济工作人员要以布尔什维克的精神掌握技术。”一方面掌握技术，一方面降低自己的布尔什维克的品质，这不是党的要求。党要求的是完整意义上的掌握技术，即是在掌握技术的同时要进一步加强自己的布尔什维克的品质。根据这样的要求，莫洛托夫同志提出，第一要熟悉自己的业务。他说，“对我们领导干部的这种要求，是无论如何不能降低的。相反地，多次愚弄过我们经济领导人员的托洛茨基和外国走狗的暗害、破坏与间谍活动的教训，要求我们更加顽强地为掌握技术而奋斗。”为要真正掌握技术，就要学习，“不仅向朋友学习，而且还要向敌人学习”。“向一切可以学的人学习”。第二，要发扬自我批评精神。他说，不发扬真正的自我批评精神，“就不可能真正地推动我们的干部前进”，“就休想达到在技术上赶上和超过先进资本主义国家的目的”。为要更快地掌握一切现代技术的成就，就决不能满足于现有的成绩，而要对成绩加以详细的检查和严格的批判，找出为什么在技术上和生产上还有许多地方远远落后于先进国家、落后于他们已达到的劳动生产率水平、落后于他们已达到的生产定额和工作质量的原因。而只要把熟悉业务和善于自我批评这两种品质结合起来，就一定能够扫除前进道路上的一切暗害分子，并保证达到所有的现代技术和生产的指标。第三，要对国家忠诚。他指出，在国家机关工作人员中的小资产阶级习惯还很顽强，还有盗窃国家财产、谎报工作成绩等现象的情况下，必须用对国家真正忠诚老实的精神来教育干部。他说，“为了求得更快的提拔，为了求得暂时的荣誉，有时候那些并不算太坏的经济工作人员也来装假，也来欺骗国家。而在这些野心家领导者的周围，则可以找到一伙谄媚者和奴仆，在这些人背后极便于隐藏各种暗害者坏蛋。”第四，要提高对敌人的警惕性。他说，“我们不能不估计到这样的事实，就是我们的阶级敌人正在采取新的、更狡猾、更隐蔽的斗争方法。这就要求我们的领导者善于识破和揭露敌人的这种新伎俩。为此，必须扩大我们干部的政治眼界，培养他们对敌的警觉，使之能识破任何伪装的敌人。只有这样，只有具备这种布尔什维克品质，我们的经济工作人员和其他工作人员才能称得起是真正的领导者。”
    莫洛托夫同志总结这个问题时说，领导者必须注意对干部的政治教育，培养和加强干部的布尔什维克的品质。“不这样做领导者就不成其为领导者，而是官僚主义分子，是官僚，总之，什么都可以是，但就不是重要岗位上的布尔什维克代表。”
    关于干部选拔问题，莫洛托夫同志指出，鉴于暗害活动的教训，这个问题有无以复加的重大的意义。他说，认真地配备和选拔干部，这是领导者不能逃避的布尔什维克的责任。这个责任就是：“应当熟悉自己的工作人员，应当监督他们的工作，检查他们的工作，应当批评落后的工作人员，撤换不称职和已经官僚主义化的工作人员，应当注意发现新生的工作人员，积极帮助把他们提拔起来。”莫洛托夫同志论证了选拔工作人员的标准。“选拔工作人员的标准只能是业务能力和政治品质，领导者应当熟悉干部的这两方面，而且不是靠听人传说或书面材料来熟悉，而是认真地根据工作中日常的观察，根据对他们工作的经常检查来熟悉。”他强调地说，“领导者必须对自己的干部负责。考查领导者，首先要考查他们是否善于使用工作人员，是否善于根据业务能力和政治品质两方面选拔干部。……如果我们的领导者不认识对这一工作所负的重大责任，那就是没有从揭露的托洛茨基匪帮的破坏、间谍、暗害勾当中吸取应有的教训。”
    关于领导方法问题，莫洛托夫同志首先指出，托洛茨基分子，破坏分子和间谍分子曾多方面利用对于经济机关中一长制原则的官僚主义歪曲来进行罪恶的勾当。所谓对一长制的官僚主义歪曲，就是把领导者自己同其他工作人员对立起来，以为自己可以不受群众和普通经济工作人员的社会监督，脱离党和非党的积极分子，不把他们看做是自己的主要支柱。莫洛托夫同志论证了一长制原则的布尔什维克精神，这个精神就是依靠党和非党的积极分子的帮助和支持来推进工作，揭露工作中的缺点，揭发和消灭一切暗害分子。他说，“经济领导工作已复杂到这种程度，经济领导者的职责范围已扩大到这种程度，以致没有积极分子的帮助和支持，领导工作就无法做好。”“生产与经济积极分子是领导者的最重要的支柱。”因此，“必须消除领导工作中的官僚主义歪曲，加强这个斗争，以布尔什维克精神把经济与生产积极分子组织起来。”
    不难了解，莫洛托夫同志在这里所说的一切，对于我们说来，同样也是值得引起我们严重注意的。在我们这里，我们同一切反革命分子进行斗争的任务也就是这样：必须加强对干部的政治教育，用精通业务、发扬自我批评精神、对党对国家抱忠诚老实态度和提高对敌人的警惕性来教育我们的干部，提高他们的政治觉悟，扩大他们的政治眼界，使他们成为既精通业务又有布尔什维克品质的干部；必须严肃认真地按照布尔什维克的原则，即按照业务能力和政治品质的标准，来配备和选拔干部，注意在日常工作中监督和考查干部，大胆而坚决地把政治上经过考验的忠于党、忠于国家、忠于社会主义事业的新生力量提拔到领导工作上来；必须改善我们的领导方法，从我们的领导机关和领导工作人员中彻底铲除官僚主义的恶习，贯彻执行我们党的群众路线——从群众中来，到群众中去，依靠广大群众的积极性和创造性来推进我们的一切工作。只有这样，我们才能在自己的前进道路上肃清一切反革命分子，保证我们的社会主义事业取得伟大的胜利。三莫洛托夫同志在他的报告的总结部分，深刻地阐明了阶级斗争的规律和当时苏联所处的阶级斗争形势。
    他指出，党的叛徒——托洛茨基分子和右倾分子已经转入了资产阶级的暗害、破坏和间谍活动，但他们只不过是资产阶级社会的残渣。新的熟练的忠实于苏维埃政权的专家正在迅速地大量地成长起来，斯达哈诺夫运动的发展和斯达哈诺夫工作者队伍的扩大反映着苏联整个工人阶级的无比壮大。但是，他警告说，决不能骄傲自满，因为就当时来说，苏联还没有完成在技术上赶上并超过先进资本主义国家的任务，而从工业和整个国家机关中清除暗害者、破坏者、间谍和其他肮脏东西正是加速完成这个任务的最重要的前提之一。
    他指出，托洛茨基分子及其一切同谋者的暗害、破坏和间谍活动证明，他们的力量已削弱到无力公开反对苏维埃政权，他们所以必须采取两面派的隐蔽活动的方式不是因为他们不想公开进攻，而是因为社会主义制度的力量比他们的力量强大。“他们害怕光明，因此就玩弄两面派手法，假装忠顺甚至于假装忠实于苏维埃政权。”但是，莫洛托夫同志又警告说，决不能对暗害活动采取政治上的漠不关心的态度。“我们中间即使还有一个两面派暗害分子，就不应忘记这种危险性，就不应沾沾自喜，就不应以为群众跟着我们走而相安无事。”
    他指出，日本德国托洛茨基走狗的暗害、破坏和间谍活动的被揭露，还证明了资本主义和社会主义之间的斗争的尖锐性和严重性。他说，敌人采取了一切斗争手段来反对社会主义，昔日的共产党员由于不坚定和动摇已经滚到最下流的境地——同法西斯勾结而进行有利于他们的暗害活动，不顾一切地叛变和出卖自己的祖国。“必须以打击来回答打击，消灭出现在我们前进道路上的来自法西斯主义阵营的这些奸细和破坏分子的队伍。”但是，莫洛托夫同志又强调地指出，斗争形势的尖锐化，说明敌人的事业已不可挽救，他们已陷入悲观失望，但这也说明，我们应该更加提高革命警惕性、社会主义的组织性和布尔什维克的党性。
    他指出，昨天的同路人，有些投入了敌人阵营，变成了法西斯走狗，成了反革命匪帮，这是并不奇怪的。他说，苏联还受着资本主义的包围，苏联的建设成就越大，阶级敌人就越发仇恨它。他们能够找到不少方法使浸透着资产阶级偏见和不相信劳动人民革命力量的人们脱离革命阵营而去投靠敌人。“在苏联社会主义胜利的基础上新的巨大革命事件之日益迫近，鼓舞着各国争取解放的工人，但同时也使浸透资产阶级的偏见和不相信工人阶级力量的人们陷于惊惶失措。托洛茨基分子和布哈林分子的投靠资产阶级阵营，变成暗害者、破坏者、杀人犯和间谍匪帮，正说明了这一点。”
    莫洛托夫同志最后教导说，不要忘记苏联正在同资本主义体系进行竞赛，斗争的规模正在日益扩大，各资本主义国家正在采取准备新战争的措施，而托洛茨基分子和其他暗害匪帮就是积极进行这种准备的一支队伍。“忘记了这一点，……就是忘记了自己对人民、对劳动人民所负的首要义务。”这个义务就是争取在这个竞赛中取得胜利，为此就要吸引广大人民群众来加紧进行社会主义建设，并从社会主义建设者的队伍中把敌人清除出去。
    当然，我们今天所处的阶级斗争的具体环境和苏联当时的环境是不同的，但是，必须按照阶级斗争的规律来认识我们自己今天所处的阶级斗争的环境这一点，却是一样的。正是在这一点上，莫洛托夫同志的报告，对我们有重大的教育意义。按照阶级斗争的规律来了解我们所处的环境，便应当看到，我们还受着帝国主义的包围，他们对我们的建设事业决不会袖手旁观；同时，被推翻了的国民党反动派和被消灭了的地主阶级是不甘心死亡的，他们对我们的建设事业也决不会不进行破坏活动；还有将要被消灭的资产阶级是不会自动退出历史舞台的，他们也决不会不反抗社会主义的改造；而已被消灭的和将被消灭的阶级中的坚决反革命分子必然还会同帝国主义勾结起来，共同进行反革命的破坏活动。这也就是自从我们开始进入有计划的社会主义建设和有系统的社会主义改造的阶段以来，反革命破坏活动越来越猖狂的社会原因。同一切公开的和暗藏的反革命分子进行斗争，已成为今天我国阶级斗争最尖锐的表现形式。我们全党的任务就是，不要用万事大吉的麻痹思想来解除了我们的武装，而是要用阶级斗争的实际知识来提高我们的政治觉悟和警惕精神，加强全党在中央统一领导下的团结，同时加强全国人民在党的周围的团结，动员全国各族人民进行坚持不懈的斗争，在斗争中来进行我们的社会主义建设事业，并在斗争中来保证我们的社会主义建设事业的胜利！
