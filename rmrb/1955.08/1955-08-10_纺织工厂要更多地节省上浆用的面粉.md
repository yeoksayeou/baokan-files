Textile Factories Should Save More Flour Used for Sizing

    Reducing the sizing rate of cotton yarn in textile factories can save a large amount of grain.
    Flour is one of the main materials for sizing yarn. The main function of sizing yarn is to increase the smoothness and strength of cotton yarn, making the cotton yarn more wear-resistant and less prone to breakage during weaving. Before liberation, in order to pursue the "luster" and "stiffness" of cotton cloth's appearance when it left the factory and was sold, cotton mills set the sizing rate (the ratio of the weight of the size used to the weight of the cotton cloth) as high as 30%. However, if the cotton cloth is sized too much, the surface luster disappears after washing with water. This not only fails to improve the quality of the cotton cloth, but also wastes a lot of flour. After liberation, starting in 1952, cotton mills uniformly implemented "light sizing," stipulating that the sizing rate should not exceed 14%. After the implementation of "light sizing" in 1953, the sizing rate had been reduced to below 14%; compared with 1951, state-owned textile factories across the country saved a large amount of grain for the country in this regard. Textile factories in Shanghai alone could save more than 6,700 bags of flour per month.
    Experiments have shown that the sizing rate can be further reduced to 8% by using water glass (also called sodium silicate) as a starch decomposing agent. In this way, the amount of starch used per cloth is reduced by 41% compared to the original, and the sizing cost is reduced by 69.2% compared to the original. If all cotton textile factories in the country use water glass as a starch decomposing agent for sizing, more than 28 million catties of flour can be saved in one year.
    Using water glass as a starch decomposing agent is an advanced Soviet experience. After 1953, this advanced experience began to be applied to textile factories in our country. After a long period of research and experimentation in the state-owned Shanghai No. 9 Cotton Textile Factory and No. 12 Cotton Textile Factory, achievements were made. The results were summarized at the National Textile Technology Professional Conference last October, affirming that this advanced experience could be promoted in our country, and a new set of sizing methods was summarized. Now, state-owned textile factories in various places have generally used water glass for sizing, and the sizing rate has been reduced to about 8%. Among them, some factories, such as the state-owned Shanghai No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory, have reduced the sizing rate to 6%.
    In the vigorous implementation of comprehensive conservation, many textile factories have stipulated indicators for further reducing the sizing rate. The sizing rate target for the third quarter of this year for state-owned cotton textile factories in Shanghai is 6.5%. After using water glass as a decomposing agent, from July of last year to the second quarter of this year, more than 2 million catties of flour have been saved.
    While universally promoting the use of water glass as a decomposing agent for sizing, some factories have also experimented with using slaked lime and caustic soda as starch decomposing agents, which have also reduced the sizing rate and saved grain. For example, after the state-owned Shijiazhuang No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory recently experimented with using caustic soda as a slurry decomposing agent, the sizing rate in April of this year has dropped from 11% to 4.8%. This shows that in terms of sizing, the possibility of saving grain is still very large. The workers and technicians of every textile factory in the country should continue to improve their technology, reduce the sizing rate of yarn and cloth, and save more industrial grain for the country.

### 纺织工厂要更多地节省上浆用的面粉

    纺织工厂要更多地节省上浆用的面粉
    葛娴
    在纺织工厂中降低棉纱上浆率，可以节约大量粮食。
    面粉是浆纱的主要材料之一。浆纱的主要作用是增加棉纱的光滑程度和强力，使棉纱在织布时耐磨，不易断头。解放前，各棉纺织厂为了追求棉布出厂时、出售时外观的“光泽”和“挺骨”，棉纱的上浆率（所用的浆的重量同棉布的重量的比率）高达百分之三十。但棉布上浆过多，经水一洗，表面的光泽消失了，这不但不能提高棉布质量，而且白白地浪费了很多面粉。解放后，从一九五二年起，各棉纺织厂一律实行了“轻浆”，规定上浆率不得超过百分之十四。实行“轻浆”以后的一九五三年，上浆率已降低到百分之十四以下；同一九五一年相比，全国国营纺织工厂在这方面为国家节约了大量粮食，仅上海一地的纺织工厂，每月即可节约六千七百多袋面粉。
    实验证明：采用水玻璃（也叫泡花碱、矽酸钠）作淀粉分解剂以后，上浆率还可以降低到百分之八。这样一来，每匹布上的淀粉用量就比原来减少了百分之四十一，浆纱成本比原来降低了百分之六十九点二。如果全国棉纺织厂都用水玻璃作淀粉分解剂浆纱，一年就可以节约二千八百多万斤面粉。
    用水玻璃作淀粉分解剂，是苏联的先进经验。一九五三年以后，这个先进经验就开始被运用到我国的纺织工厂中来了。在国营上海国棉第九棉纺织厂和第十二棉纺织厂中经过较长时期的研究和试验，取得成绩以后，在去年十月全国纺织技术专业会议上作了总结，肯定了这个先进经验在我国是可以推行的，并且总结出来了一套新的浆纱工作法。现在，各地国营纺织工厂已普遍用水玻璃浆纱，上浆率已降到百分之八左右。其中有的工厂，如国营上海第五棉纺织厂，上浆率已降低到百分之六。
    在厉行全面节约中，许多纺织厂都规定了进一步降低上浆率的指标。上海国营棉纺织厂今年第三季度的上浆率指标为百分之六点五，采用水玻璃作分解剂以后，从去年七月到今年第二季度，已节省面粉二百多万斤。
    在普遍推行用水玻璃作分解剂浆纱的同时，有些工厂试验用熟石灰和火碱作淀粉的分解剂，也都降低了上浆率，节约了粮食。如国营石家庄第一棉纺织厂最近试验用火碱作浆料分解剂以后，今年四月份上浆率已由百分之十一降到百分之四点八。这说明在浆纱方面，节约粮食的可能性还是很大的。全国每一个纺织工厂的职工和技术人员，都应该继续不断地改进技术，降低纱布的上浆率，更多地为国家节省工业用粮。
