Cultural and health workers are welcomed by people of all ethnic groups in the border areas of Yunnan.

If a film projection team comes to a village to show a movie, whether it is a new or old film, as soon as the news spreads, people from dozens of miles around will carry flashlights and torches, climb mountains and cross rivers, regardless of sunny or cloudy weather, to watch the movie at the screening square.

A health worker, carrying that welcome red cross bag into the countryside, is surrounded by the masses as soon as they enter the village, one calling them "elder sister," another shouting "comrade," warmly inviting them to their homes. People say: "These are the people sent by Chairman Mao."

Our work in this area is good. Otherwise, our health workers and film projection teams would not be loved and welcomed by the ethnic minorities. However, with the improvement of the political consciousness of the ethnic minorities and the increasing development of production, their demands for cultural life and health have also increased accordingly. Our work is still not keeping up with their demands.

Not long ago, I went to the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region on the west bank of the Nujiang River in Yunnan Province for an interview. In the Manbang寨 (village) of Mengmao区 (district), Luxi County, I saw a Dai farmer named Jin Leng, who is the deputy director of the Manbang寨 Unity Production Committee and the director of the township credit cooperative. One evening, we were sitting around a table in his new bamboo building. He raised a question: "Why doesn't the film team come here?"

I asked him, "Has the film team been here before?"

"No," he said immediately, "The film team only screens films in Mangshi. We really want to see the production experience of the inland and learn the advanced agricultural techniques of the Han elder brothers."

Then he said: "Two years ago, health workers often came to the village to organize the masses to eliminate mosquitoes and flies, but they haven't come this year."

We believe that the relevant leading organs should pay attention to Jin Leng's opinion. Because this work is loved by the masses in the ethnic minority areas. This opinion is not only held by Jin Leng alone, but everyone we encountered who touched on this issue had the same feeling, including the comrades in the local cultural and health departments. That is to say, our film projection teams and health workers should come to the border areas as much as possible to meet the urgent needs of the people of the ethnic minorities in the border areas to improve their cultural and health levels.

    文化卫生工作者应到边疆的村寨来
    刘时平
    电影放映队和卫生工作人员，在云南的边疆地方，受到各兄弟民族人民的欢迎。
    一个电影放映队，如果到一个村寨里放映电影，不管是新片子，还是老片子，只要消息传开来，周围几十里地的群众，都要打着电筒，点着火把，爬山涉水，不分晴天或者阴天，赶到放映电影的广场上去看。
    一个卫生工作人员，背着那受人欢迎的红十字袋下乡，一进村寨，就被群众前呼后拥，这个叫大姐，那个喊同志，亲热地引到家里，人们都说：这是毛主席派来的人。
    我们在这方面的工作是好的。要不然，我们的卫生工作人员和电影放映队就不会受到兄弟民族的爱护和欢迎了。然而，随着兄弟民族的政治觉悟的提高，生产的日益发展，他们对于文化生活和卫生健康的要求，也就相应地提高了。我们的工作还赶不上他们的要求。
    不久以前，我到云南省怒江西岸的德宏傣族、景颇族自治区采访，在潞西县允茂区勐茂?（乡）的蛮棒寨，看到一位傣族农民，他的名字叫金冷，是蛮棒寨团结生产委员会的副主任，又是全乡信用合作社的主任。有一天晚上，我们在他的新竹楼里，几个人团团地坐在一张桌子的周围。他提出了一个问题：“电影队为什么不到我们这里来？”
    我问他：“电影队以前来过没有？”
    “没有”，他紧接着说：“电影队以前只是在芒市放映。我们很想看一看内地的生产经验，学习汉族老大哥的农业先进技术。”
    接着他又说：“前两年卫生工作人员常到寨子里来组织群众灭蚊蝇，今年也不来了。” 
    我们觉得有关的领导机关应该重视金冷的这个意见。因为这项工作，在兄弟民族地区是为群众所热爱的。这个意见，不只金冷一个人有，我们碰到的人，只要接触到这个问题，都有同样的感觉，就是当地的文化、卫生部门的同志也有同感。那就是说，我们的电影放映队和卫生工作人员，要尽量到边疆来，满足边疆兄弟民族人民提高文化和卫生水平的迫切要求。
