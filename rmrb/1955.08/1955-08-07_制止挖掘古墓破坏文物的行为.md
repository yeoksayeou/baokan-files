    Stop Digging Up Ancient Tombs and Destroying Cultural Relics
    To the Editor:
    From March to June this year, eight incidents of illegal excavation of ancient tombs were discovered successively in Jiangyin, Wuxi, and Wujin counties, and the suburbs of Wuxi city in Jiangsu Province. More than ten tombs with preservation value were damaged and cultural relics were destroyed. For example, a large ancient tomb dating back to the Six Dynasties period in An'nan Township, Benniu District, Wujin County, was dug open by farmers. The stone gate and tables and stools inside the tomb were dismantled, and several boxes of pottery with imprinted patterns and glazed pottery figurines were broken. Tomb bricks with rope patterns were taken to build sheep pens. Farmers in Huzhuang Township, Jiaoxi District, heard that there were a lot of gold and silver jewels in an ancient tomb at Qiaotou, so they removed the crops planted on top of the tomb and dug it up, taking away several pieces of gold and silver jewelry. Farmers from the Beixin Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huashu District, Jiangyin County, in order to take tomb stones to pave roads, used explosives to blast open the tomb chamber, almost destroying all the cultural relics. Farmers from Binjiang Township, Xiagang District, secretly dug up a Song Dynasty tomb and found eight iron oxen. Initially, they thought they were gold oxen cast in iron, so they randomly beat them, resulting in them being misshapen.
    The practice of farmers digging up ancient tombs not only damages cultural relics, but also affects production. Zou Guiliang and 15 other farmers from Dongxing Township, Jiangyin County, seeing the potential profit from digging up tombs, abandoned agricultural production. In addition, whenever a tomb is excavated, many farmers travel long distances to see the "novelty."
    It is worth noting that these destructive acts against cultural relics have also received the support of some staff members of local government agencies. They mistakenly believe that this is "turning dead treasure into living treasure" and conducive to agricultural production. For example, the Civil Affairs Section of Bashi District, Wuxi County, once approved the Douxi Township government to issue a certificate allowing local farmers to dig up tombs. I believe that the Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee should pay attention to this issue, vigorously strengthen publicity and education on the protection of cultural relics and historical sites, and stop the continued occurrence of similar phenomena.

### 制止挖掘古墓破坏文物的行为

    制止挖掘古墓破坏文物的行为编辑同志：
    从今年三月到六月，江苏省江阴、无锡、武进三县和无锡市郊连续发现了八处盗掘古墓的事件，十多座有保存价值的墓葬和文物遭到了破坏。如武进县奔牛区安南乡一座六朝时代遗留的大型古墓被农民挖开了，墓内的石门和桌凳等都被拆毁，几盒印纹陶器和带釉的陶俑等物也被打坏了，绳纹墓砖被拿去砌了羊窝。焦溪区胡庄乡农民听说桥头一处古墓里有很多金银珠宝，将墓顶所种农作物铲掉掘墓，结果取走了多件金银饰品。江阴县华墅区的北新村农业生产合作社的农民，为了取墓石铺路，用炸药炸开墓室，几乎将全部文物都炸毁了。夏港区滨江乡农民偷挖宋墓，发现了八只铁牛，起初以为是外铸铁的金牛，就乱加敲打，结果弄得不成形状。
    农民挖掘古墓的做法，不但破坏了文物，而且还影响了生产。江阴县东兴乡的农民邹桂亮等十六人见掘墓有利可得，竟放弃了农业生产。此外，每当挖出一处墓葬，总有很多农民远道赶来看“稀奇”。
    值得注意的是，这些破坏文物的做法，还得到了当地政府机关某些工作人员的支持。他们错误地认为这是“变死宝为活宝”，有助于农业生产。例如无锡县八士区民政股就曾批准斗西乡政府出证明准许当地农民挖墓。我认为，江苏省人民委员会应该重视这个问题，大力加强保护文物古迹的宣传教育，制止类似现象的继续出现。
