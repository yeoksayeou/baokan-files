To the Editors:

According to a recent inspection, a wooden box (weighing fifteen catties) of discarded steamed buns and cornbread was found in the yard of the No. 3 dormitory of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in three or four days; a total of fifty catties of steamed buns, pancakes, and cornbread were picked up on the tables, windowsills, in the flower beds, and in the trash cans of the No. 6 dormitory rooms.

Saving food has become a mass movement. Why is there such serious waste in the dormitories of this factory? It is hoped that the leaders of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant will conduct an inspection and strengthen the publicity work on saving food.

　  石景山钢铁厂一些宿舍浪费粮食编辑同志：
    据最近检查，石景山钢铁厂第三宿舍的院子里在三、四天中就发现扔弃的馒头和窝头一木箱（十五斤重）；在第六宿舍房间的桌上、窗台上和院子的花池里、垃圾箱里拣到馒头、烙饼和窝头共五十斤。
    节约粮食已经成为群众性的行动，为什么在这个厂的宿舍里还出现如此严重的浪费现象呢？希望石景山钢铁厂领导方面进行一次检查，并加强节约粮食的宣传工作。　牛庆波
