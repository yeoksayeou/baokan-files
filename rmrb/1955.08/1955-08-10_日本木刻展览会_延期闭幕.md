The "Exhibition of Japanese Woodcuts," sponsored by the Chinese Artists Association, opened at the Art Exhibition Hall on July 29th. Since then, it has been visited by workers, citizens, government employees, artists and amateur art enthusiasts, as well as students from universities and middle schools. Song Qingling and Shen Junru, Vice Chairpersons of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Chen Yun, Vice Premier of the State Council, also visited the exhibition. The exhibition was originally scheduled to close on the 8th, but in order to give more audiences the opportunity to visit, it has been decided to extend it to the 14th.

This exhibition has left a deep impression on the audience. Many viewers wrote their opinions in the comments book: "From the works, we seem to hear the Japanese people's voice demanding independence and peace." "I like these works, they vividly reflect the tragic life and heroic struggle of the Japanese people under American military occupation. I hope their struggle will be victorious soon!" "These works make us clearly see that the Japanese people and the working people of the world are united in the struggle for peace."... Many viewers mentioned their particularly favorite works, such as "At the U.S. Military Base," "Water," "Accusations of Atomic Disease Victims," "Unemployed," "Stray Bullet," "Wounded Dove of Peace," etc. The serial woodcut "Don't Forget Hanamaki" attracted great attention from the audience, who believed that it expressed the deep friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people in their common struggle. Some suggested that it be printed and published as a comic strip.

Many viewers expressed great love for those color woodcuts that fully express the Japanese national style. The craft woodblock prints on display were also widely praised by the audience. (Feng)

    “日本木刻展览会”延期闭幕
    中国美术家协会主办的“日本木刻展览会”，七月二十九日在美术展览馆开幕以来，连日参观群众有工人、市民、机关工作人员、美术家和业余美术爱好者，以及各大、中学学生等。全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长宋庆龄、沈钧儒，国务院副总理陈云，也曾前往参观。展览会原定八日闭幕，为了给更多观众以参观的机会，决定延期至十四日闭幕。
      这个展览会给了观众深刻的印象。许多观众在意见簿上写下了他们的意见：“从书面上我们仿佛听到了日本人民要求独立、和平的声音。”“我喜欢这些作品，它们鲜明地反映出日本人民在美国军事占领下的悲惨生活和英勇斗争。我希望他们的斗争早日胜利！”“这些作品使我们清楚地看到日本人民和全世界劳动人民一致在为和平而斗争。”……许多观众提到他们特别喜爱的作品，如“在美军基地”、“水”、“原子病害者的控诉”、“失业者”、“流弹”、“受伤的和平鸽”等。连环木刻“不要忘记花冈”引起观众极大注意，认为它表现了中日两国人民在共同的斗争中的深厚友谊，有人建议印成连环画册发行。
    许多观众表示非常喜爱那些充分表现了日本民族风格的套色木刻。展出中的工艺木版画也受到观众普遍的赞扬。（风）
