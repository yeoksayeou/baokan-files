    An Unused School Building

    To the Editor:
    In 1953, the Electrical Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building invested more than 60,000 yuan, entrusting the Shanghai Wire Factory to build a school building for a workers' technical school. This school can accommodate more than 100 students, with complete classrooms, offices, dormitories, cafeterias, libraries, and lounges. However, this school building, completed in November 1953, has been locked and unattended ever since.

    It is said that this school was originally unnecessary. After it was built, the leadership put forward the call for streamlining and thrift, so it was decided to discontinue it. However, I believe that leaving this newly built school building idle for a long time is also a waste. The Electrical Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building should find ways to utilize it, or allocate it to other units in need.

    一所无人利用的校舍编辑同志：
    第一机械工业部电器工业管理局在一九五三年投资六万多元，委托上海电线厂建筑一所职工技术学校的校舍。这个学校可以容纳一百多个学生，教室、办公室、宿舍、食堂、图书室和休息室等都很齐全。但是，这所校舍在一九五三年十一月建成后，一直锁着大门，无人过问。
    据说，这所学校本来是不必设立的，造好以后，正好领导方面提出精简节约的号召，于是就决定停办了。但是，我认为，让这所新造好的校舍长期闲着，也是一个损失。第一机械工业部电器工业管理局应该设法加以利用，或者拨给其它需要的单位。上海电线厂  袁中义
