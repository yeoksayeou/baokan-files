Xinhua News Agency report: Shanghai Municipality has approved the applications of 168 private textile and light industry factory owners for public-private joint ventures on August 11th. Combined with the over 100 heavy industry factories approved for joint ventures last month, a total of 270 private factories across 22 industries in the city will implement public-private joint ventures this year, exceeding the total number of joint ventures in previous years. After these factories become joint ventures, it is estimated that by the end of this year, the state-owned, cooperative, and public-private joint venture sectors will account for over 64% of the city's total industrial output value. The ratio of output value between public-private joint venture factories and private factories will change from 8:100 in 1952 to 85:100.

The 168 factories approved for joint ventures this time include all private factories in eight industries, such as cotton spinning, wool spinning, linen spinning, cigarette manufacturing, paper making, enamelware, flour milling, and rice milling, as well as two ice-making plants. The implementation of public-private joint ventures across entire industries is a first for Shanghai. These private industries generally hold significant positions in Shanghai, and even in the national economy. The cotton spinning and wool spinning industries in Shanghai have a history of fifty to sixty years. The city's cotton spindles account for more than one-third of the national total. Other industries such as paper making, cigarette manufacturing, and enamelware also account for approximately 20% to 50% of the national output. Private factories generally account for a quarter to a half of the total output value of each industry. In the past few years, private factories in these industries have successively accepted state processing, ordering, and purchasing/marketing, becoming intermediate forms of state capitalist enterprises, and some factories have already implemented public-private joint ventures.

According to the joint venture plans formulated by relevant government departments and the capitalists of these factories, the private factories in these eight industries will, with the exception of the ten factories affiliated with the Shenxin and Yong'an Textile Companies that will implement systematic joint ventures and a portion of factories that will implement individual joint ventures, mostly adopt the method of large factories leading small factories and advanced factories leading backward factories to implement merger-based joint ventures. In total, the private factories in these eight industries will be transformed into 99 public-private joint venture factories. Many private factories in the wool spinning industry with only spinning, weaving, or dyeing and finishing equipment will become comprehensive wool textile factories after merging and becoming joint ventures, except for one factory. After the merger and joint venture of many factories in the cotton spinning, cigarette manufacturing, and other industries, the large organizations will be streamlined, and the management expenses of the enterprises can be reduced as a result.

    上海市公私合营工厂增多
    上海市人民委员会八月十一日批准一百六十八个私营纺织业和轻工业工厂的资本家申请公私合营。连同上月批准实行合营的一百多个重工业工厂，今年全市将有二十二个行业的二百七十个私营工厂实行公私合营，比前几年合营的总数还要多。这些工厂合营以后，今年年底全市工业总产值中，国营、合作社营和公私合营部分，预计将达到百分之六十四以上；公私合营工厂和私营工厂产值的比例，将由一九五二年的八比一百变为八十五比一百。
    这次批准合营的一百六十八个工厂包括棉纺、毛纺、麻纺、卷烟、造纸、搪瓷、面粉、碾米等八个行业的全部私营工厂和两个制冰厂。全行业实行公私合营，在上海还是第一批。这几个私营行业在上海以至全国国民经济中，大多占有重要的地位。上海市棉纺和毛纺工业已有五六十年的历史，全市棉纺业的纱锭占全国三分之一以上，其他如造纸、卷烟、搪瓷等行业，产量也占全国百分之二十到五十左右；各行业生产总值中私营厂的比重，一般在四分之一到二分之一以上。过去几年中，这些行业的私营工厂都已先后接受国家的加工、订货和收购、包销，成为中级形式的国家资本主义企业，有一部分工厂已实行公私合营。
    根据政府有关部门和这些工厂的资本家共同拟定的合营方案，这八个行业的私营工厂，除申新、永安两个纺织公司所属十个厂分别实行系统合营和一部分厂实行单独合营外，大部分厂将采取大厂带小厂、先进厂带落后厂的方法，实行并厂合营。总计这八个行业的私营厂共将变成九十九个公私合营厂。毛纺业中只有纺、织或染整设备的许多私营厂合并合营后，除一个厂外，都将成为全能的毛纺织工厂。棉纺、卷烟等行业许多厂合并合营后，庞大的机构将得到精简，企业的管理费用可由此减少。
