The Xi'an Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Corporation promptly transported various autumn fabrics to various parts of Northwest China. In June, it advanced the shipment of floral serge, striped cloth, and other items that were originally scheduled to be shipped in July to Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. From April to July, a total of more than 6,300 tons of various cotton cloths were shipped, of which more than 42,000 bolts of cotton cloth had been delivered to Xinjiang Province, which is far away.

In order to improve the patterns and varieties of fabrics, this purchasing and supply station, together with the production departments, held cotton cloth variety touring exhibitions and business personnel seminars in Xi'an, Xianyang, Lanzhou, and other places in the second quarter, soliciting opinions from fabric salespersons and the people. Based on the opinions of the masses, they have stopped the production of several unsalable fabrics and improved the color and quality of vulcanized blue cloth and other fabrics. Floral serge supplied to Shaanxi and Gansu was first selected for samples and production in Lanzhou and various parts of Shaanxi in the second quarter. After pattern selection, 26 patterns popular among the people, such as "Peacock Displaying Its Feathers" and "Magpie Perched on Plum Tree," were determined and are now being produced and supplied one after another.

　　花纱布公司西安采购供应站及时调运各种秋季布匹
    中国花纱布公司西安采购供应站及时把秋季布匹运往西北各地。六月份就提前把一部分应在七月份调运的花哔叽、条布等运往陕西、甘肃。四月到七月，共运出各种棉布六千三百多吨，其中有四万二千多匹棉布已经提前运到路途较远的新疆省。
    为了改进布匹的花色品种，这个采购供应站在第二季度同生产部门一起在西安、咸阳、兰州等地举办了棉布品种巡回展览会、业务人员座谈会，征求了布匹营业员和人民群众的意见。根据群众的意见，他们已经将几种不好销的布匹停止生产，同时改进了硫化蓝布等的色泽质量。供应陕西、甘肃的花哔叽，在第二季度就先在兰州和陕西各地进行了选样定产。经过花样评选，确定了“孔雀开屏”、“喜鹊登梅”等二十六种群众喜爱的花样，现正陆续生产和供应。
