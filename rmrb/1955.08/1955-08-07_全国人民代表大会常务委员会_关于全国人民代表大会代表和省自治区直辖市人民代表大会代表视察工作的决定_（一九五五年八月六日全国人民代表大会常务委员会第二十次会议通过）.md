    (Adopted at the Twentieth Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on August 6, 1955)
    1. In order to understand the work situation in various places, closely connect with the masses, and listen to the opinions and demands of the masses, deputies to the National People's Congress and deputies to the People's Congresses of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government shall generally inspect work twice a year. The inspection time should generally be after the spring ploughing and after the autumn harvest. Deputies who are old and weak or who are indeed unable to leave their posts may not go to inspect or inspect near their residence.
    2. Deputies to the National People's Congress may go to the areas of their original electoral units or other areas to inspect work; deputies to the People's Congresses of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government may go to the areas of their original electoral units or other areas within the scope of the province, autonomous region, or municipality directly under the Central Government to inspect work. When inspecting work, they can conduct inspections in groups or individually.
    3. When deputies to the National People's Congress and deputies to the People's Congresses of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government inspect work, they may learn about the situation from relevant personnel of the local People's Committee, People's Court, and People's Procuratorate; they may attend local People's Congress meetings and People's Committee meetings as non-voting delegates; they may meet with local People's Representatives and visit the people.
    4. When deputies to the National People's Congress and deputies to the People's Congresses of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government arrive in the inspection area, they may contact the local People's Committee to obtain their assistance. People's Committees and other relevant departments in various places should provide convenience for the deputies in their inspection work.
    5. Deputies do not directly handle problems when inspecting work, and the problems found shall be handled by the local People's Committee, People's Court, and People's Procuratorate respectively. When necessary, deputies to the National People's Congress may report the problems found to the Standing Committee for handling; deputies to the People's Congresses of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government may report the problems found to the People's Committee of the province, autonomous region, or municipality directly under the Central Government for handling.
    6. When deputies to the National People's Congress inspect work, the required travel expenses shall be reimbursed by the Standing Committee; when deputies to the People's Congresses of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government inspect work, the required travel and food expenses shall be reimbursed by the People's Committee of the province, autonomous region, or municipality directly under the Central Government, and no additional burden shall be imposed on the local governments.
