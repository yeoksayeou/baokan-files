    Broad Avenues for Conserving Grain in Industry
    Su Nong
    In industrial production, grain is used as a raw material in many instances, and as an auxiliary material in many others. The amount of grain used annually by cities nationwide in grain processing, the food industry, the brewing industry, and other industrial production is substantial. Therefore, conserving grain in industrial production occupies a very important position in the grain conservation movement.
    There are very broad avenues for conserving grain in industrial production, among which the following are simple to implement and have a significant impact:
    1. Reduce waste of grain in factories during the production process and in grain storage. In the past, the waste in this area was quite alarming. With just a little attention, a lot of grain can be saved. The Beijing Municipal State-Owned Beijing Winery had waste at every stage, from grain storage to wine production, wasting a total of 3.2 million jin of grain last year. Each batch of grain was stored in the warehouse for only about a week, yet last year the warehouse lost more than 150,000 jin of grain, and from January to May this year, it lost another 50,000 jin, the vast majority of which was eaten by sparrows and rats. At the Qingdao Jinghua Cotton Mill, over 600 jin of starch were wasted and simply washed away daily in the sizing water. Many food factories scatter flour on the ground during production, and dough and broken biscuits that fall on the ground are thrown into the furnace and burned. All of this waste can be avoided. The bakery workshop of the Shanghai Yimin Food Factory No. 4 uses flour sacks to line the workbenches so that the raw bread does not stick to the surface, saving 20 jin of flour a day. After the flour is used, the remaining flour inside the sacks should be emptied out, but in the past, the amount of flour lost in the flour sacks was incalculable. The Beijing No. 1 Flour Mill alone recovered more than 2,000 jin of flour from more than 83,000 empty flour sacks.
    2. Use substitutes as much as possible to save grain. In industrial grain consumption, much can be replaced with other raw materials. Some can utilize industrial and agricultural by-products, and some can even utilize things that were previously considered waste. In this regard, many successful examples have emerged in various regions. For example, in many places, sodium silicate is being used instead of sizing materials for yarn and paste for mounting. According to Beijing statistics, if the city's dyeing and weaving industries all use sodium silicate instead of flour paste, more than 1 million jin of flour can be saved annually. In the past, grain was the main raw material for brewing wine. Now, many wineries are experimenting with using fruits and other raw materials for brewing, with good results. The brewing industry in Anhui Province uses wild fruits and persimmons, mulberries, dates, barnyard millet, sweet potato roots, corn cobs, and other materials to brew wine, saving more than 4,090,000 jin of grain from January to May this year. Wine lees were originally waste from wineries, only used to feed pigs. The wineries in Xinxian, Shanxi Province, Luonan, Shaanxi Province, and Tianjin use wine lees to make koji, which not only saves grain used for making koji but also discovers that the saccharification power of lees-koji is better than that of grain-koji. Rice water was also generally considered useless, but the Shanghai Chemical Plant uses its sediment to extract glucose and alcohol, saving a large amount of grain. In the past, when manufacturing certain castings, the Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory needed to use a large amount of flour to bind the sand and increase the hardness of the sand molds. Now, it uses clay and white mud instead, saving more than 2,000 jin of flour per month.
    3. Improve technology and operating methods, and strive to increase grain utilization rates, producing more products without increasing grain consumption. Currently, the amount of grain used is uneven in the same grain-using industries. For every 100 jin of wheat gluten, the Shanghai Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory can make 9.33 jin of MSG, while the United Monosodium Glutamate Factory can only make 7.64 jin. In the dyeing and weaving industry in Qingdao, some factories use only 4 liang of cornstarch to size a bundle of yarn, while others use 1 jin. If those that use more grain follow the example of those that use less, the grain saved would be considerable. The cotton mills in Shijiazhuang City adopted advanced Soviet experience and reduced the sizing rate. According to calculations by the State-Owned Shijiazhuang No. 1 Cotton Textile Mill, Shijiazhuang Textile Mill, and Daxing Textile Mill, more than 345,000 jin of grain for sizing material can be saved throughout the year. The staff of the Tianjin State-Owned Glorious Soy Sauce Factory established temperature records, mastered the temperature changes of grain during the fermentation process, and improved operating techniques. In May, they produced nearly 90,000 kilograms more of Grade 1 soy sauce without increasing grain consumption, which is equivalent to saving more than 40,000 jin of grain.
    4. Eliminate some unnecessary grain consumption. Many cities have now eliminated caramel coloring in soy sauce, saving a large amount of grain used to make caramel. Caramel has no benefit to human health and is just a decorative ingredient to darken the color of soy sauce. Eliminating caramel does not affect the quality of soy sauce. After private soy sauce factories in Chongqing promoted the production of natural-colored soy sauce, they saved more than 100,000 jin of rice and broken rice every month. The Wanli boards produced by the Shanghai No. 1 Timber Factory originally used paste to glue labels, using 1,200 jin of flour a year. Now, they have eliminated the labels and use lime water to brush on the characters, which saves both grain and printing costs.
    Conserving grain in industry is not only beneficial to the country's grain work but, first and foremost, it is beneficial to the enterprises themselves. Whether it is an industry that uses grain as a main raw material or an auxiliary raw material, saving grain reduces costs, which benefits both producers and consumers. The Lanzhou Private Gongyou Chemical Cooperative experimented with using soybean cake instead of soybeans to brew soy sauce, which can reduce costs by 38%. The Shanghai No. 2 Printing and Dyeing Factory uses sodium silicate glue instead of printing glue for printing, which can reduce the cost by 9 yuan and 1 jiao per 100 liters of glue and also save a large amount of steam and water. However, not all industrial grain-consuming departments have paid attention to this issue, and some unit leaders and technical personnel still have conservative ideas in this regard. Some believe that they are too busy to spare time to study this issue; some believe that it is inevitable to waste some grain in production; some say: Saving one jin of imported raw materials can save a lot of money, but saving one jin of grain only saves a few jiao, and it is not worth spending a lot of effort on this. These ideas are obviously wrong. As long as we can mobilize the staff to think of ways and learn from the advanced experience of other places and other factories, it is not difficult to gradually save grain in production. Saving imported raw materials is important, but we cannot underestimate the role of saving grain. In production, all raw materials should be saved as much as possible. In the current situation in our country where grain production is not growing as fast as the growth of industrial production and people's living needs, saving grain is even more important. There are also a few capitalists who hold a resistant attitude towards saving grain, turning a blind eye to the waste of grain in the factory, and are unwilling to make necessary improvements. The iron pans on the biscuit ovens of the Shanghai Private Xingfu Biscuit Factory have been in disrepair for many years, and trays and trays of biscuits often fall into the ovens and are burned. The trade union urged the capitalists to improve them, but the capitalists were unwilling to repair them, even saying: "If you want to repair them, please lend money from the trade union." The trade union cited examples of other biscuit factories improving their operation and management and reducing waste to urge the capitalists to improve, but the capitalists said: "Other factories are other factories, we are different." When the campaign to save grain was generally launched in Shanghai factories, the trade union urged the capitalists to repair the iron pans, but the capitalists were only willing to repair some of them, and the remaining bad iron pans were still being used. This resistant attitude must be corrected.
    Conserving grain in industry is not just a matter for the industrial sector. Scientific research workers should actively summarize the experiences of various regions and study various production methods that can both save grain in industry and not reduce the quality of products. The commercial system should help promote new products with reduced grain consumption rates and conduct publicity to the masses, and should not simply cater to the old habits of the masses.
    Conserving grain in industry is a long-term task. There is considerable potential for various industrial departments that use grain to save grain in production. These departments should actively mobilize their staff, combine saving grain with improving operation and management, and strive to save grain in production in all aspects.

    节约工业用粮有广阔的门路
    苏农
    工业生产中有很多是以粮食为原料的，也有不少是以粮食为辅助材料的。全国城市每年在粮食加工业、食品业、酿造业及其他工业生产上用的粮食，数量很大。因此，节约工业生产的用粮在节约粮食运动中占着很重要的地位。
    节约工业用粮有十分广阔的门路，其中简单易行、作用较大的有以下几个方面：
    一、减少工厂在生产过程中和粮食保管工作中对粮食的浪费。过去在这方面的浪费是相当惊人的，只要稍加注意就可以节约许多粮食。北京市地方国营北京酿酒厂从粮食保管到制成酒的每一个过程都有浪费，去年一年就浪费了三百二十万斤粮食。这个厂每批粮食在库房里只放一星期左右，可是去年一年在库房里就损失粮食十五万多斤，今年一月到五月又损失五万多斤，其中绝大部分是被麻雀和老鼠吃掉的。青岛经华棉织厂每天放走的浆水中，就有六百多斤淀粉白白随水流走了。许多食品工厂在生产过程中随地抛撒面粉，掉在地上的面团、碎饼干等就扔进炉里烧掉。这些浪费都是可以避免的。上海益民食品四厂面包车间利用面粉袋垫在工作台上，使生面包不黏住台子，一天就可节约
  二十斤面粉。用完面粉，应该把袋内余粉倒干净，可是过去在面粉袋上损失的面粉，却难以计算。北京市唯一面粉厂从八万三千多个空面粉袋中，就收回了两千多斤面粉。
    二、尽量采用代用品，节省粮食。工业用粮中，有很多是可以用别的原料代替的，有的可以利用工业和农业的副产品，有的甚至可以利用过去认为是废物的东西。在这方面，各地已经有许多试验成功的例子。例如浆纱用的浆料和裱糊用的浆糊，有不少地方已用矽酸钠来代替。据北京市统计：如果全市染织业都以矽酸钠代替面粉浆，一年可以节约一百多万斤面粉。酿酒的原料，过去主要是用粮食；现在已有许多酒厂试用果品和其他原料酿酒，效果很好。安徽省酿酒工业利用野生果物以及柿子、桑葚、枣子、稗子、甘薯根须、玉米棒芯子等酿酒，从今年一月到五月就节约了四百零九万多斤粮食。酒糟原来是酒厂的废料，只用来喂猪；山西忻县、陕西雒南和天津的酒厂采用酒糟来制曲，不但节省了酿曲用的粮食，而且发现糟曲的糖化力比粮食还好。淘米水本来大家也认为没有什么用处，可是，上海化工厂利用它的沉淀物提炼葡萄糖和酒精，就节约了大量粮食。上海矿山机器厂过去制造某些铸件时，为了使砂子粘结，增加砂模硬度，需要使用大量的面粉，现在运用陶土和白泥代替，每月可以节约两千多斤面粉。
    三、提高技术，改进操作方法，努力提高粮食利用率，在不增加粮食用量的情况下，多出产品。现在在同一种用粮的工业中，用粮的数量是不平衡的。每一百斤面筋，上海天厨味精厂可做九点三三斤味粉，而联合味精厂只做七点六四斤。青岛染织业中有的厂浆一捆纱只用玉米淀粉四两，有的厂却要用一斤。如果用粮多的都向用粮少的看齐，节省的粮食就相当可观了。石家庄市各棉纺厂采用苏联先进经验，降低了上浆率，据国营石家庄第一棉纺织厂、石家庄纺织厂和大兴纺织厂三个厂计算，全年就可以节约作浆料的粮食三十四万五千多斤。天津市国营光荣酱油厂职工，建立了温度记录，掌握了粮食在发酵过程中的温度变化，改进操作技术，五月份没有增加用粮而多生产了近九万公斤一号酱油，等于节约了四万多斤粮食。
    四、取消一些不必要的用粮。现在很多城市已经取消了酱油里的酱色，节省了大批制酱色用的粮食。酱色本来对人体的健康没有一点好处，只是加深酱油色泽的点缀品，取消酱色并不影响酱油的质量。重庆市私营酱油厂推行制造本色酱油后，每月就节省十多万斤大米和碎米。上海木材一厂出厂的万利板原来用浆糊贴字，一年要用一千二百斤面粉，现在取消了贴字，改用石灰水刷字，既节约了粮食，又节约了纸张印刷费。
    节约工业用粮，不只是对国家的粮食工作有利，首先是对各企业本身有利。不论是以粮食为主要原料或辅助原料的工业，节约了粮食，就降低了成本，对生产者和消费者都有好处。兰州市私营工友化工社试验用豆饼代替大豆酿造酱油，可降低成本百分之三十八。上海第二印染厂以矽酸胶浆代替印染胶浆印花，每一百公升胶浆可降低成本九元一角，还可节省大量的蒸汽和水电。可是，并不是所有的工业用粮部门全都重视了这个问题，有些单位的负责人和技术人员在这方面还有保守思想。有的认为工作忙，挤不出时间来研究这个问题；有的认为在生产中浪费一些粮食是不可避免的事；有的说：节约一斤进口原料可以节省很多钱，节约一斤粮食才角把钱，不值得在这上面多花费脑筋。这些思想显然都是错误的。只要能够很好地发动职工想办法，多学习别地别厂的先进经验，逐步在生产中节约粮食是不难做到的。节约进口原料固然重要，但也不能轻视节约粮食的作用。在生产中，一切原料都应该尽量节约；在我国目前粮食增产还赶不上工业生产和人民生活的需要的增长的情况下，节约粮食就更加重要了。还有少数资本家对于节约粮食抱着抗拒的态度，对厂内浪费粮食的现象熟视无睹，不愿作必要的改进。上海私营幸福饼干厂烘饼干炉子上的铁盘年久失修，常有一盘子一盘子的饼干翻掉在炉里烧掉，工会督促资方改进，资方不愿修，甚至说：“要修，请工会借钱来。”工会举出其他饼干厂改善经营管理、减少浪费的例子来督促资方改进，资方却说：“别的厂是别的厂，我们是两样的。”当上海各厂普遍开展节约粮食运动后，工会又督促资方修理铁盘，资方也只肯修理一部分，其余的一些坏铁盘，还在继续使用。对这种抗拒态度，是必须加以纠正的。
    节约工业用粮也不光是工业部门的事。科学研究工作者应该积极总结各地经验，研究出各种既能节约工业用粮、又不降低产品质量的生产方法。商业系统应该帮助推销用粮率降低后的新产品，向群众进行宣传，不要单纯迁就群众的旧习惯。
    节约工业用粮是一个长期的任务。使用粮食的各个工业部门节约生产用粮的可能性都相当大，这些部门应该积极发动职工，把节约粮食和改善经营管理工作结合起来，努力从各方面节约生产用粮。
