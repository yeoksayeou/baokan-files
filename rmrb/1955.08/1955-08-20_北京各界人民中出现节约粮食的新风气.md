    A New Atmosphere of Grain Conservation Emerges Among All Circles of People in Beijing

    (Our Newspaper News) Since Beijing Municipality rectified the work of planned grain supply, a new atmosphere of grain conservation has gradually been established among people from all walks of life.

    The canteens of government offices and enterprises have generally eliminated the past phenomenon of wastefulness, where food was scattered everywhere. Some canteens have achieved "clean bowls and clean tables." Management and culinary staff from some central and municipal-level government offices have also visited each other to learn and exchange experiences in saving grain. School publications and wall newspapers have waged struggles against wasteful behaviors such as peeling steamed buns and spilling rice grains when serving. Students have generally recognized that wasting grain is a shameful act.

    "Cherish grain, do not waste a single grain!" has become an informal mass-based social pact. Residents of the capital are now paying attention to saving grain in every household. When people gather in the big courtyards to enjoy the cool of the summer evenings, they talk about ways to save grain. In the past, waste of grain was more common in collective dormitories for employees and their families, but now leftover rice and steamed buns are no longer seen in the sewage ditches and garbage cans of these dormitories, and people who spill rice grains while washing rice at the tap will be publicly criticized. Many housewives strive for "three cleans" when kneading dough: a clean basin, clean hands, and a clean dough. They measure the amount before cooking, ensuring they "know the quantity in their hearts," thus reducing leftover rice and steamed buns. Leftover rice is also properly handled, either steamed and eaten, or made into noodles and sponge cakes. Even the water used to cook noodles is not thrown away but is used to leaven dough. "Old Beijingers" have changed their habit of eating boiled rice and switched to eating steamed rice and braised rice, which saves grain and increases nutrition. Through ubiquitous publicity, children have also understood the importance of saving grain. Many elementary school students have mobilized their mothers to verify the family's grain consumption plan. Mothers no longer allow their children to waste grain by eating steamed buns as snacks at any time.

    Formulating a family grain consumption plan has helped many working people improve their lives. Many workers have changed the "rule" of being flush with money at the beginning of the month and tight at the end. In many working-class families in Qianmen, Xuanwu, and other districts, saving grain has led to improved non-staple foods. Those who previously ate rice with pickles and chili powder now often eat vegetables, tomatoes, and vegetable soup. Gao Yuzhen, a resident of Xuandi Temple, whose husband is a carpenter without a fixed income, used to spend money without a plan and had to borrow money every winter. After formulating a grain consumption plan, the couple paid attention to saving everywhere, and their life became more organized. Taking advantage of their recent busy work period, they saved twenty yuan in June and July and opened a bank account for the first time.

    北京各界人民中出现节约粮食的新风气
    本报讯　北京市整顿粮食计划供应工作以后，各界人民中已逐步树立起节约粮食的新风气。
    机关、企业的食堂，一般都已消灭了过去饭菜狼藉的浪费现象。有些食堂做到了“碗光桌面净”。中央和市级的有些机关的管理和炊事人员，还互相参观学习，交流了节约粮食的经验。各学校的校刊和墙报曾经向吃馒头剥皮、盛饭撒饭粒等浪费现象进行斗争。学生们已普遍认识到浪费粮食是可耻的行为。
    “爱护粮食，不浪费一粒粮食！”无形中成了群众性的生活公约。首都居民现在家家户户都已注意节约粮食。大杂院夏夜乘凉时，大家谈论的是节约粮食的办法。过去职工家属集体宿舍浪费粮食的现象较普遍，现在集体宿舍的污水沟、垃圾箱里已看不到剩饭剩馒头，水龙头上淘米撒米粒会受到公众的批评。许多家庭妇女在和面时都做到三光：盆光、手光、面光。做饭以前都量过，做到“心中有数”，因此剩饭剩馒头减少了；对剩饭也都作适当处理，或者蒸煮以后吃掉，或者做到面食、丝糕里去；连面汤也不撒掉，用来发面。“老北京”们改变了爱吃捞饭的习惯，改吃蒸饭、闷饭，既节约了粮食，又增加了营养。在家喻户晓的宣传中，孩子们也都懂得了节约粮食的道理。许多小学生动员妈妈核实了家庭用粮计划。母亲们不再让孩子无定时的用馒头当零嘴糟塌粮食了。
    制定家庭用粮计划帮助了许多劳动人民改善了生活。许多职工改变了月初钱松月底紧的“规律”，前门、宣武等区许多劳动人民家庭因为节约粮食改善了副食，原先用咸菜、辣椒粉就饭的，现在常吃蔬菜、西红柿和菜汤了。玄帝庙居民高玉珍，丈夫是个木匠，没有固定收入，过去用钱无计划，每到冬天，就要借债。制定用粮计划后，夫妻俩处处注意节约，生活有了安排，他们趁最近活儿忙时，在六、七两月攒下了二十元，第一次进银行开了个存折。
