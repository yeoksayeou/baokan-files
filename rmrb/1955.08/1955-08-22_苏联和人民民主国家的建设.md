    Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries Construction
    Recent Developments in the Construction of the World's Largest Hydropower Station
    August 21st marked the fifth anniversary of the Soviet Council of Ministers' decision to build the world's largest hydropower station—the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station—on the Volga River. Construction Director Komzin told a TASS reporter: In recent years, the banks of the Volga River have become unrecognizable. More than four million cubic meters of concrete have been laid in the hydropower equipment, and more than 100 million cubic meters of earth have been excavated.
    Recently, the lower navigation locks and the canals connecting these locks have been completed. The left channel of the Volga River has been blocked. Currently, the river surface around the Zhiguli Mountains has been reduced to 360 meters wide. The construction of the upper locks is in full swing, and these locks will be put into use next spring. More than one million cubic meters of concrete have been laid in the foundation pit of the reinforced concrete spillway dam.
    Approximately nine million cubic meters of earth have been excavated and approximately two million cubic meters of concrete have been laid in the foundation pit of the power plant on the right bank of the Volga River. Builders have recently continuously set new world records in the speed of laying concrete in hydraulic engineering.
    Now, the construction has entered a decisive stage. Simultaneously with the construction of the power plant, the first batch of water turbines is being assembled on the right bank. The project to block the right part of the Volga River with a dam will begin next month. Six weeks later, suction dredgers will pour six million cubic meters of earth into the right wing of the dam.
    The construction workers have decided to complete the annual plan for construction and assembly engineering by December 20th, to start generating electricity in December, and to put the final hydropower unit into production when the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union opens in February 1956.
　　Great Achievements in Soviet Forestry
    The "Forestry Pavilion" of the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition showcases the development and achievements of Soviet forestry to visitors.
    The total forest area in the Soviet Union now exceeds 1.1 billion hectares, accounting for one-third of the world's total forest area. There are more than 1,000 mechanized forestry enterprises across the country.
    The Soviet people cherish and strive to increase their rich forest resources. In order to prepare a general plan for forestry development in various regions, large-scale surveys have been conducted on 579 million hectares of land in the past five years alone. From 1949 to 1954, a total of 46.7 billion saplings were cultivated in nurseries across the country. In the past five years, 8.6 million hectares have been afforested.
    The Soviet Union pays great attention to continuously improving virgin forests. Currently, large-scale clearing of primitive jungles and drainage work in forest swamps are underway. Experience has shown that after draining the water, the growth rate of trees can be increased by two to four times, and the quality of wood can also be improved.
    The transplanting of precious trees and the cultivation of new varieties have also achieved success. In the forest farm near the "Forestry Pavilion," people can see many new varieties of trees cultivated by Soviet scientists and forestry workers, such as fast-growing poplar trees, drought-resistant oak trees, and cold-resistant nut trees.
　　Fundamental Changes in Poland's Class Structure
    According to the Polish Press Agency, as a result of socialist industrialization, Poland's class structure has undergone fundamental changes, and the number of people employed outside of agriculture has greatly increased.
    In 1939, 61 percent of Poland's population depended on agriculture for a living. By 1953, this number had decreased to 46 percent.
    As early as the end of the Three-Year Plan (1949), Poland eliminated unemployment. With the progress of socialist construction, as of 1954, Poland's industry, transportation, trade, culture, education, and other non-agricultural sectors had absorbed more than 3 million employees, which is more than double the number before the war. The Six-Year Plan stipulates that the number of non-agricultural employees should reach 5.7 million by the end of 1955, but in fact it reached about 6 million by the end of 1954. This number is equal to 22.2 percent of the total population, while it only accounted for 7.8 percent in 1938 before the war, and only 16.5 percent in 1949.
    The working class has not only grown in number, but also greatly improved their cultural and technical level, thereby promoting a more rapid growth in industrial production. During the Six-Year Plan period, the number of employees in Poland's socialist industry increased by about 50 percent, while the production volume increased by about 1.3 times.
　　Good Harvests in Czech State Farms and Agricultural Cooperatives
    According to the Czechoslovak News Agency, state farms and unified agricultural cooperatives in Czechoslovakia have achieved good harvests this year, and many crops have achieved high yields.
    In the state farm of Velké Bříště near Prague, workers harvested an average of 3,900 kilograms of grain per hectare. The highest yield reached 5,000 kilograms per hectare. In the Rabín unified agricultural cooperative in Vodňany County, České Budějovice Region, the average harvest of winter barley was more than 4,300 kilograms per hectare. In the state farm of Gottwaldov Region, workers have harvested more than one-third of all grains, with an average harvest of 3,000 kilograms of winter barley per hectare and more than 4,000 kilograms of malting barley per hectare, an increase of a quarter compared to previous years.
    The rape harvest is also very good this year in various places. For example, state farms and unified agricultural cooperatives in Opava County, Ostrava Region, harvested an average of 1,600 to 2,000 kilograms of rape per hectare, and the highest harvest even reached 2,700 kilograms.
    As a result of the good harvest, as of August 6, the state's plan to purchase agricultural products this year has been completed in thirty-four counties.
  　Splendid Achievements in the Development of Romanian Heavy Industry
    Romania has made great achievements in developing heavy industry since its liberation.
    Currently, the proportion of Romanian heavy industry production in the total output value of socialist industry has increased to 60 percent. In 1954, the steel and iron produced by the steel industry had increased to about four times and 3.5 times that of 1938, respectively. This year, Romania's steel industry will produce 36 percent more iron and 25 percent more steel than last year.
    Romania's machinery manufacturing industry, as the heart of heavy industry, has developed particularly significantly. Its production accounts for 22 percent of the entire industrial production. The situation that 99 percent of machinery and equipment depended on imports before liberation has been greatly reversed. From 1948 to 1954, 50 percent of the new machinery and equipment added to Romanian factories were manufactured domestically. Romania is currently able to produce all the machinery and equipment needed for its petroleum industry and mining industry, and about 90 percent of the machinery needed for agriculture, light industry, and the food industry.
    The famous Romanian oil industry has also been rapidly restored and developed after liberation. In recent years, the Romanian people have opened up nearly twenty new oil production areas in the original oil zones of western Muntenia, Moldova, Oltenia, and Ploiesti. In 1954, Romania, with a population of more than 16 million, had increased its oil production from 3.5 million tons in the early days of liberation to about 10 million tons. This year, Romania's oil production will also increase to 11 million tons.
    In terms of electricity production, Romania began implementing a ten-year electrification plan in 1951. In recent years, the country's power generation has increased by more than 60 percent, more than double the power generation in 1938. Currently, the number of electrified villages in rural areas alone is 1.1 times more than the number of villages electrified in the fifty years before liberation.
    In addition, Romania's coal mining industry, cement industry, and chemical industry have also been greatly developed. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    苏联和人民民主国家的建设
    世界上最大水电站建设近况
    八月二十一日是苏联部长会议发布关于在伏尔加河畔建设世界上最大的水电站——古比雪夫水电站的决定的五周年。水电站建设处主任科姆津向塔斯社记者说：这几年来，伏尔加河两岸已变得不能认识了。水力工程设备中已敷设了四百多万公方的混凝土，同时又挖走了一亿多公方的泥土。
    最近，下通航水闸和联结这些水闸的运河已经完工。伏尔加河的左边的河道已被堵住。目前，这条河在日古里山一带的河面已缩小为三百六十公尺宽。上水闸的工程正在紧张进行中，这些水闸将在明年春天开始使用。钢筋混凝土的溢流坝的基坑中已敷设了一百多万公方的混凝土。
    伏尔加河右岸的电力厂的基坑中已经挖走了大约九百万公方的泥土，并且敷设了大约两百万公方的混凝土。建筑者们最近在敷设混凝土的速度方面，连续创造了世界水力工程的新纪录。
    现在，建筑工程已经进入了决定性的阶段。和建筑电力厂的同时，正在右岸上装配着第一批水轮机。用堤坝堵住伏尔加河右部河道的工程将在下个月开始。六个星期之后，吸泥机将把六百万公方的泥土灌入堤坝的右翼中。
    建筑工人们已经决定在十二月二十日完成建筑和装配工程的全年计划，在十二月开始发电，并且在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会在一九五六年二月开幕时，使最后的水力发电单位投入生产。
　　苏联林业的伟大成就
    苏联农业展览会的“林业展览馆”向观众们展示了苏联林业的发展情况和成就。
    苏联的森林总面积现在已经超过十一亿公顷，占全世界森林总面积的三分之一。全国拥有机械化的林业企业一千多个。
    苏联人民非常珍视并努力增加自己丰富的森林资源。为了编制各地的林业发展总计划，单是过去五年中就在五亿七千九百万公顷土地上进行了大规模的考察工作。从一九四九年到一九五四年，全国苗圃中共培植了四百六十七亿株树苗。最近五年中还要植林八百六十万公顷。
    苏联非常注意不断改善原始森林。目前，正在清除原始丛林和在森林中的沼泽地带进行大规模的排水工作。经验证明，排干水之后，树木的生长率可以提高二到四倍，木材的质量也可提高。
    珍贵树木的移植工作和新品种的培育工作也获得了成就。在“林业展览馆”附近的林场上，人们可以看到苏联科学家和林业工作者培育的许多新品种树木，如快生白杨树、抗旱橡树、抗寒坚果树等。
　　波兰阶级结构发生根本变化
    据波兰通讯社报道：由于社会主义工业化的结果，波兰阶级结构已经发生根本变化，农业以外的就业人数大大增加。
    一九三九年，波兰全国居民中有百分之六十一靠农业生活，到一九五三年，这一数字已降低到百分之四十六。
    早在三年计划结束时（一九四九年）波兰就消灭了失业现象。随着社会主义建设事业的进展，截至一九五四年，波兰工业、交通运输、贸易、文教等农业以外的部门吸收了三百多万就业者，它们的就业人数比战前增加了一倍以上。六年计划规定农业以外的就业人数到一九五五年年底为五百七十万，而实际上一九五四年年底就达到了六百万左右。这个数目等于全体人口的百分之二十二点二，而战前一九三八年只占百分之七点八，一九四九年也只占百分之十六点五。
    工人阶级不仅在数量上增长了，而且他们的文化水平和技术水平也大大提高，因而促成了工业生产更迅速的增长。在六年计划期间，波兰社会主义工业的职工约增加了百分之五十，而生产量却增加了一点三倍左右。
　　捷国营农场和农业合作社丰收
    据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道：捷克斯洛伐克的国营农场和统一农业合作社今年获得了丰收，许多作物都得到高额产量。
    在布拉格附近大不里斯的国营农场，工人们在每公顷的土地上平均收获了三千九百公斤的谷物。最高的收成达到每公顷五千公斤。在契斯克·布德约维泽州沃德纳尼县的拉宾统一农业合作社，每公顷冬大麦平均收获了四千三百多公斤。在哥特瓦尔德夫州的国营农场，工人们已经收割了所有的谷物的三分之一以上，每公顷冬大麦平均收获了三千公斤，每公顷麦芽大麦平均收获了四千多公斤，比往年增产四分之一。
    各地今年油菜的收成也是很好的。例如，俄斯特拉发州俄巴发县的国营农场和统一农业合作社，每公顷平均收获油菜一千六百到两千公斤，最高的收获量甚至达到两千七百公斤。
    由于丰收的结果，截至八月六日，国家今年收购农产品的计划已在三十四个县内完成。
  　罗重工业发展的辉煌成就
    罗马尼亚解放以来在发展重工业方面取得了巨大的成就。
    目前，罗马尼亚重工业的生产在社会主义工业的生产总值中所占比重已经增加到百分之六十。一九五四年，钢铁工业所生产的钢和铁已经分别约增为一九三八年的四倍和三点五倍。今年，罗马尼亚钢铁工业将比去年多生产百分之三十六的铁和百分之二十五的钢。
    作为重工业心脏的罗马尼亚机器制造业发展得特别显著。它的生产在整个工业生产中的比重占百分之二十二。解放前百分之九十九的机器设备依赖进口的状态已被大大地扭转过来。从一九四八年到一九五四年，罗马尼亚各工厂所增加的新机器设备中有百分之五十都是本国制造的。罗马尼亚目前并且能够生产本国石油工业和采矿工业所需的全部机器设备，生产农业、轻工业和食品工业所需的百分之九十左右的机器。
    著名的罗马尼亚石油工业在解放后也得到了迅速的恢复和发展。近几年来，罗马尼亚人民在穆腾尼亚西部、摩尔多瓦、奥尔登尼亚和普罗什蒂等地的原有石油地带，新辟了将近二十个石油产地。一九五四年，一千六百多万人口的罗马尼亚生产的石油，已经从解放初期的三百五十万吨增加到了约一千万吨。今年，罗马尼亚的石油生产还将增加到一千一百万吨。
    在电力生产方面，罗马尼亚从一九五一年起开始执行十年电气化计划，最近几年全国发电量增加了百分之六十以上，比一九三八年的发电量增加两倍多。目前，单是农村中电气化的村子就比解放前五十年电气化的村子还多一点一倍。
    此外，罗马尼亚的采煤工业、水泥工业和化学工业等也得到了巨大发展。　（据新华社讯）
