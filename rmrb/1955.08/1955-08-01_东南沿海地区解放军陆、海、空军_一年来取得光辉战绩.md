Xinhua News Agency, 31st. The People's Liberation Army stationed in the southeast coastal region has achieved brilliant successes in the heroic struggle to liberate Taiwan and defend national defense over the past year.

    After the joint declaration by various democratic parties and people's organizations in August 1954 to liberate Taiwan, the PLA's commanders and fighters stationed in the southeast coastal area were greatly encouraged with a strong will and determination to "liberate Taiwan." Over the past year, the commanders and fighters have actively carried out regular and modernized military and political training, which has greatly enhanced the military skills and combat effectiveness of modern combined arms operations; on the other hand, they have heroically and continuously attacked the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops from the land, air, and sea, and liberated all the islands along the coast of Zhejiang, including Yijiangshan Island, with joint amphibious operations, actively creating conditions for the final liberation of Taiwan.

    In the past year, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, under the protection of the American aggressors, continued to harass and sabotage the southeast coastal areas. In particular, after the signing of the so-called US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty," which openly interfered in our country's internal affairs and actively prepared to launch a war of aggression, the remnant Chiang bandit army, navy, air force, and sea bandits intensified their harassment and sabotage activities against the southeast coastal areas. The People's Liberation Army's ground, naval, and air forces stationed in the southeast coastal area vigilantly guarded the motherland's coastal defense, constantly thwarting the enemy's conspiracy to sneak in and sabotage, and inflicting heavy blows on the invading Chiang bandit troops.

    The comprehensive battle results of the People's Liberation Army's ground, naval, and air forces stationed in the southeast coastal region in the past year are as follows:

    From July 1, 1954, to July 20, 1955, our army crossed the sea and liberated all the islands occupied by the Chiang bandit army along the coast of Zhejiang, including Dachen Island (Taizhou Islands), Yushan Islands, Pishan Island, Yijiangshan Island, and Nanji Islands. A total of 4,672 Chiang bandit troops were wiped out (including the remnant Chiang bandit ground, naval, and air forces, as well as small groups of bandits and armed secret agents who landed), including 808 killed or wounded, 2,903 captured, and 961 who surrendered. 160 US-made Chiang bandit aircraft were shot down or damaged, including 43 shot down and 117 damaged. Four Chiang bandit aircraft defected. Twenty Chiang bandit warships were sunk, damaged, or destroyed, including six sunk and fourteen damaged or destroyed. Fifty-seven Chiang bandit motorized sailboats were captured. The army seized 100 cannons, 1,321 machine guns and rifles of various types, more than 195,800 rounds of artillery shells, and more than 5,756,000 rounds of ammunition from the Chiang bandit army. Our army also destroyed many Chiang bandit military command organs, positions, and warehouses.

    东南沿海地区解放军陆、海、空军
    一年来取得光辉战绩
    新华社三十一日讯　最近一年来，中国人民解放军驻东南沿海地区的陆、海、空军，在解放台湾、保卫国防的英勇斗争中取得了光辉的成就。
    一九五四年八月各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言发表后，极大地鼓舞了驻东南沿海地区的人民解放军全体指挥员、战斗员“一定要解放台湾”的坚强意志和决心，一年来，指战员们一面积极展开正规化现代化的军事、政治训练，大大地增强了现代化各兵种联合作战的军事素养和战斗威力；一面英勇地从陆地、从空中、从海上不断地痛击蒋贼军，并以各兵种联合渡海作战，解放了浙江沿海一江山岛等全部岛屿，积极为最后解放台湾创造条件。
    在过去一年中，蒋介石卖国集团在美国侵略者庇护下，继续对东南沿海地区进行骚扰和破坏，特别是旨在公然干涉我国内政和积极准备发动侵略战争的所谓美蒋“共同防御条约”签订后，蒋贼残余陆、海、空军和海匪更加加紧了对东南沿海地区的骚扰和破坏活动。人民解放军驻东南沿海地区陆、海、空军警惕地守卫着祖国海防，不断地粉碎敌人窜扰破坏的阴谋，并给进犯的蒋贼军以沉重打击。
    一年来，驻东南沿海地区的人民解放军陆、海、空军的综合战绩如下：
    自一九五四年七月一日到一九五五年七月二十日，我军渡海解放了蒋贼军盘踞的浙江沿海的大陈岛（台州列岛）、渔山列岛、披山岛、一江山岛、南麂山列岛等全部岛屿。歼灭蒋贼军（包括蒋贼残余陆、海、空军以及小股土匪、登陆的武装特务等）四千六百七十二人，内毙伤八百零八人，俘掳二千九百零三人，投诚九百六十一人。击落击伤美造蒋贼飞机一百六十架，内击落四十三架，击伤一百一十七架。蒋贼飞机起义四架。击沉击伤击毁蒋贼舰艇二十艘，内击沉六艘，击伤击毁十四艘。缴获蒋贼机帆船五十七只。缴获蒋贼军各种炮一百门，机关枪和长、短枪一千三百二十一支，各种炮弹十九万五千八百多发，子弹五百七十五万六千多发。我军并摧毁蒋贼军指挥机关、阵地、仓库等多处。
