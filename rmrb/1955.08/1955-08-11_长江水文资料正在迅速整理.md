    Yangtze River hydrological data is being rapidly organized
    As one of the important preparatory works for planning and harnessing the Yangtze River, the organization of Yangtze River hydrological data is progressing rapidly.
    In preparation for harnessing the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission had already begun a comprehensive organization of all hydrological records of the Yangtze River since hydrological records began in 1865. The method of organization is to review and compile year by year, and then publish them in volumes. The review and compilation work has now been completed up to 1953, and the Yangtze River water level and meteorological data for 1950 and 1951 have already been published in volumes. The hydrological and meteorological data of the Han River since 1929 was completed in 1954.
    The Yangtze River basin is wide, with many tributaries, and the hydrological data is very vast and complex; especially the hydrological data before liberation, which is not only incomplete, but also much of it is forged. In the process of compilation, hydrological workers carefully check and organize the data of the Yangtze River basin over the years, such as water level, flow, rainfall, sand content, wind force, and wind direction, from all aspects such as the change of water level in the upper and lower reaches, and the balance of water volume, so that it can become the data needed for planning and design work.

    长江水文资料正在迅速整理
    规划治理长江的重要准备工作之一，长江水文资料的整理工作进展很快。
    为准备治理长江，长江水利委员会早已开始对一八六五年长江有水文记载以来所有的水文纪录加以全面整理。整理的办法是逐年审查整编，然后刊印成册。现在审查和整编工作已作到了一九五三年，一九五零年和一九五一年长江水位、气象资料已经刊印成册了。汉水一九二九年以来的水文、气象资料，在一九五四年已整理完了。
    长江流域广、支流多，水文资料非常庞杂；特别是解放前的水文资料，不但残缺不全，而且许多是伪造的。水文工作者在整编工作中仔细地从上、下游水位的变化，水量的平衡等各个方面，对长江流域历年水位、流量、雨量、含砂量、风力、风向等资料，认真地进行检查和整理，使之成为合乎规划设计工作需要的资料。　（新华社）
