The Science and Technology Learning Movement of Young Children Combining Hands and Brains
Committee Member of the Mechanical Engineering Group of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization　Yun Zhen

After seeing the National Science and Technology and Craftwork Exhibition of Young Children, my heart is filled with infinite joy and hope. This is the foundation and budding of scientific research and technological practice for the next generation of our New China. Knowing that these creations or imitations are from young children only nine to fifteen years old, we can imagine how diligent they are in their studies, how they combine their hands and brains, and how they demonstrate collective wisdom. It also shows how painstakingly and patiently the elementary and junior high school teachers teach, guide, and connect with reality, which is fundamentally different from the education methods before liberation.

The exhibits in this exhibition are carefully selected from small exhibitions in various regions, and many works demonstrate outstanding talent. We hope that this habit of students personally doing things, collecting and making, imitating or creating various scientific and technological models should be vigorously promoted by the state, schools, and families to form a nationwide trend. Only in this way can we lay a broad and deep foundation for our socialist industrialization. I hope that teachers and students in primary and secondary schools in various places, when promoting practice, must recognize that this is for learning scientific theories, for studying specific things, and for cultivating the habit of combining hands and brains, not for competing for novelty, not for showing off individual schools or students, and not just for holding exhibitions. Recognizing the goal, correcting the attitude, and avoiding deviations, this movement can become long-term, universal, and beneficial to socialist industrialization after it is launched. As for the outstanding performance of geniuses and the honors in the exhibition, they are natural by-products that will come with the development of this movement.

When young comrades are engaged in this interesting work, they must carefully connect the learning principles with the trial products in each proposition; because when you do it yourself, you must analyze the content clearly, understand the principles, and discuss with classmates more, and ask teachers or counselors for advice. By doing it yourself, you can understand deeply, and you can find difficulties and ways to solve them. The important thing is not to waste materials, and you should try to use waste materials and scattered small materials as much as possible. For example, in this exhibition, there are many good works that use waste materials. The model of the parachute tower, although very beautifully made, is of little significance, and the materials used are also specially cut new materials, which is not a typical example.

On the three issues of tools, materials, and workshops, I think the educational authorities must find ways to provide strong assistance. Small tools for children are generally difficult to buy on the market. Scattered materials for airplane models and radio receivers are also not yet normally supplied. Not only are there no small metalworking and woodworking workshops in the home, but there are also very few in schools, and there is often a lack of guidance in "Children's Homes" and "Children's Palaces." I think tools and materials can be negotiated by the education authorities and local industrial departments, and equipped and supplied in a timely manner according to the needs of gradual development. If there is a workshop in the school, it should be guided by teachers. The workshops in the urban children's palaces can invite young technicians from the factory to assist. Both active and widespread work is required, and material conservation is required. The motherland expects this scientific movement to develop healthily, let us all work hard.

    手脑并用的少年儿童科学工艺学习运动
    中华全国科学技术普及协会机械学组委员　恽震
    看了全国少年儿童科学技术和工艺作品展览会，我心中充满了无限的喜悦和希望。这是我们新中国后一代科学研究和技术实践的根基和萌芽。要知道这是才只九岁到十五岁的少年儿童所创作或仿制的，我们可以想像到他们的学习是如何勤奋，他们手脑并用，表现了集体的智慧。这里又可以看出小学和初中的教师们是如何苦心教导，循循善诱，联系实际，跟解放以前的教育方法根本不同。
    这一个展览会的展出品，是从各地区的小展览会中精选出来的，有许多作品表现了特出的天才。我们希望这种由学生亲自动手、采集制作、摹仿或创造出各种科学工艺模型的习惯，要由国家、学校、家庭大力提倡，养成全国规模的风气。这样才能为我们的社会主义工业化打下宽广而深厚的基础。我希望各地中小学的教师和学生们，在推广实践的时候，要认清这是为了学习科学理论，为了研究具体事物，为了培养手脑并用的习惯，不是为了争奇斗胜，不是为了表演个别的学校或学生，不是仅仅为了开展览会。认清了目标，端正了态度，避免了偏差，这一运动开展后就能成为长期性的，普遍性的，和有利于社会主义工业化的。至于天才的特出表现，和展览中的荣誉，就是自然而然的副产品，会随着这个运动的开展而俱来。
    少年同志们在进行这种有趣味的工作时，必须在每一个命题上，把学习的原理和试制品好好联系起来；因为动手做，就更要把内容分析清楚，道理弄明白，多和同学商量，多向老师或辅导员请教。亲自动手，就能深入了解，就能找出困难和解决困难的方法。重要的一点，是不要浪费材料，应该尽量利用废料和零星小料。比如这次展览会中，有不少好作品是利用废料的。那一座降落伞塔的模型，制作虽很精美，但意义不大，用的材料也是特加裁剪的新料，不是一个典型的范例。
    在工具、材料、工作室三个问题上，我想必须由教育机关设法予以大力的协助。儿童用的小工具，市上一般很难买到。飞机模型和无线电收音机的零星材料，现在也还没有正常的供应。小金工小木工的工作室，不但家庭中没有，在学校里也很少，在“少年之家”和“少年宫”里又往往缺少指导的人。我想工具和材料可以由教育机关和地方工业部门协商，根据逐步发展的需要，及时地配备供应。学校里如有工作室，应由教员辅导。市区少年宫的工作室，可以约请工厂里青年技工作辅导。既要求工作活跃而普及，又要求节约材料。祖国期待这一科学运动健康地发展，让我们大家努力罢。
