Gradually Rationalize the Regional Distribution of Institutions of Higher Education
Zhang Jian, Deputy Director of the Planning Department of the Ministry of Higher Education

    The institutions of higher education in old China were mostly concentrated in coastal cities. Since the founding of New China, although attention has been paid to the development of institutions of higher education in the interior, the unreasonable distribution of institutions of higher education has remained basically unchanged. Until now, about nearly two-thirds of the nation's institutions of higher education's manpower and resources are still concentrated in coastal and near-coastal cities. This is detrimental to both the nation's socialist construction and the development of the institutions of higher education themselves.

    The over-concentration of institutions of higher education in coastal areas is not adapted to the distribution of our nation's newly built industries. Since our nation's newly built industries are mostly distributed in the interior areas close to raw materials, fuels, and sales regions, the disconnection between schools and newly built industries creates many difficulties for students' practical training and teachers' scientific research. It also causes many inconveniences in hiring engineers from factories and mines to teach part-time at schools and in assigning graduate jobs. This situation is also inconsistent with the needs of national defense.

    Although the unreasonable distribution of institutions of higher education is a legacy of old China, due to our lack of foresight, in the past few years of departmental adjustments, we only focused on solving the problems of department and specialty settings between schools to overcome unreasonable phenomena such as complexity, dispersion, and duplication, and did not adequately address the rational deployment of the regional distribution of institutions of higher education. At the same time, our past plans also had some shortcomings in regional arrangements. For example, we excessively emphasized the difficulties in establishing new schools in the interior, catered more to the existing foundations, and lacked overall planning, so that the future development focus of institutions of higher education was still placed on expanding existing schools in coastal areas. This is clearly a conservative ideology that only sees the part and not the whole.

    For the long-term interests of our nation's socialist construction, institutions of higher education should, in the future, be rationally deployed in a planned and gradual manner according to the new distribution of the national economy, especially industry, and to meet the needs of national defense. The existing institutions of higher education in coastal cities should generally maintain their current scale and no longer carry out major capital construction. Individual institutions of higher education can be moved inland. Schools close to coastal areas should appropriately reduce their future development scale and reduce expansion. Institutions of higher education originally planned to be established in coastal cities should be built in the interior, except in special circumstances, such as shipbuilding colleges which must be located in coastal cities. The work of adjusting departments in institutions of higher education should be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner to prevent blindness. At the same time, new schools should be appropriately added according to the requirements of newly built industries and the entire national economic construction. When building schools and carrying out departmental adjustments, attention should be paid to implementing the principle of combining schools with related production enterprises and other relevant departments. For example, engineering colleges should be combined with industrial centers of the same nature, comprehensive universities should be combined with scientific research centers, and agricultural and forestry colleges should be combined with agricultural production and economic regional planning requirements, so that the schools' teaching work, scientific research, and practical training can be closely linked to reality.

    In the process of changing the regional distribution of existing schools, the following principles must be observed: First, according to the interests of our nation's long-term socialist construction and the requirements for the long-term development of institutions of higher education in the future, there must be a realistic overall plan, which should be implemented gradually starting from the 1955 academic year. It is necessary to take into account the various difficulties that may be encountered today, and to obey the requirements of long-term construction. When the two conflict, the current difficulties must be overcome to obey the interests of long-term construction. Second, full attention must be paid to leveraging the potential of existing schools' manpower and resources in coastal cities, so that these schools can, on the one hand, cultivate high-quality construction talents for the country, and on the other hand, vigorously support the newly built schools with manpower and resources, especially in the replenishment of teaching staff. Schools in coastal cities should regard supporting newly built schools as their glorious political task. Newly built schools in the interior should prevent excessive concentration as much as possible, and pay attention to avoiding excessive haste.

    Rational deployment of the regional distribution of institutions of higher education is an arduous and complex task. There must be sufficient understanding of the difficulties in the work, and first of all, there must be a spirit of hard work and overcoming difficulties. For example, some schools, where all work has begun to be incorporated into the planning track, are bound to partially disrupt the original teaching order once departmental adjustments are carried out, and will more or less affect the progress of teaching reform and the improvement of teaching quality. Some schools find it difficult to complete the teaching plan on time because they need to reorganize teaching work; inland cities have heavier industrial construction tasks, and new institutions of higher education may encounter many difficulties in capital construction and transportation.

    In order to do a better job in rationally deploying the regional distribution of institutions of higher education, it is necessary to conduct ideological mobilization work among all relevant personnel. First of all, it is necessary to repeatedly explain the great significance of rationally deploying the regional distribution of institutions of higher education, pointing out that this work is very beneficial to the country's entire construction cause and to the development of the institutions of higher education themselves. For the long-term interests of the country, all parties should actively cooperate and overcome difficulties. It should also be explained that the construction and expansion of inland cities are carried out in accordance with the principles of socialist urban planning. Although today's municipal construction conditions are temporarily not as good as those in coastal cities, in the future, the arrangement and layout of various municipal constructions will be more rational than in coastal cities. This is to encourage educators in coastal cities to work in the interior.

    Secondly, due to the relocation of schools and the adjustment of departments, various difficulties will occur in teaching and life. The leadership should of course consider minimizing or avoiding movement as much as possible. However, it should be pointed out to everyone that our nation's newly built industries are mostly distributed in the interior. These industries have the latest equipment and more engineering and technical personnel. Schools and factories can help each other, which is more conducive to production and teaching work. For example, due to the adjustment of departments, the teaching staff, administrative leading backbone, teaching equipment, and capital construction area of some schools have more or less changed. This requires repeatedly explaining to everyone that the original schools can only fully complete the tasks assigned by the state if they support the newly built factories and mines in the interior in the same way that our original factories and mines vigorously supported the newly built factories and mines. Therefore, all schools should establish an overall concept of mutual assistance. In short, everyone should proceed from the needs of the country's construction so that the work of rationally deploying the departments of institutions of higher education can be carried out smoothly.

    The higher education leadership department should study and formulate an overall plan in conjunction with relevant business departments; at the same time, relevant schools should cooperate in a timely manner to carry out the necessary preparatory work. For example, individual schools preparing to move inland should promptly transfer capable administrative leading backbone and academically specialized teaching staff to organize a team capable of carrying out school construction work and organizing teaching work, so that as soon as they arrive in the new area, they can quickly carry out teaching work according to the teaching plan. The original schools in the interior should, on the one hand, carry out necessary expansion, and on the other hand, give full play to the potential in all aspects and undertake as many enrollment tasks as possible. In capital construction, in accordance with the central government's instructions on carrying out a comprehensive conservation campaign, local materials and construction forces should be used as much as possible to strive for early construction, so that the new school buildings can be completed in a timely manner. In addition, all relevant institutions of higher education should rely on the leadership and help of the local provincial and municipal Party committees and governments to vigorously solve the various difficulties in the adjustment of departments.

    All institutions of higher education in the country should proceed from the overall interests, cooperate closely under the leadership of the Party, and overcome difficulties, so that the regional distribution of institutions of higher education in our country can gradually become more rational.

    逐步使高等学校的地区分布趋于合理
    高等教育部计划司副司长　张健
    旧中国的高等学校大都集中在沿海城市。新中国成立以来，虽已重视内地高等学校的发展，但高等学校分布不合理的情况基本上没有改变，直到现在，全国高等学校约近三分之二的人力、物力还集中在沿海和接近沿海地区的城市。这对国家的社会主义建设事业和高等学校本身的发展都是不利的。
    高等学校过于集中在沿海地区，同我国新建工业的分布不相适应。由于我国的新建工业多半分布在接近原料、燃料和销售地区的内地，学校同新建工业脱节，这就使学生的生产实习和教师的科学研究遇到许多困难；聘请厂矿的工程师到学校兼课以及分配毕业生的工作，也都有许多不便。这种状况，也不合于国防的要求。
    高等学校分布不合理的状况虽是旧中国遗留下的恶果；但由于我们预见性不够，在过去几年的院系调整过程中，就只注意了解决各校之间系科、专业设置方面的问题，以克服庞杂、分散、重复等不合理的现象，而没有很好地解决合理部署高等学校的地区分布问题；同时，我们过去编拟的计划，在地区安排上也有若干缺点，例如过分地强调了在内地建立新校的困难，较多地迁就了现有基础，缺乏统盘规划，以致把高等学校的今后发展重点仍放在扩建沿海地区原有的学校上。这显然是一种只看到局部、没有看到全局的保守思想。
    为着我国社会主义建设的长远利益，今后高等学校应该按照国民经济特别是工业的新的分布，及适应国防的要求，有计划地逐步地加以合理部署。沿海城市现有的高等学校，一般应维持现有的规模，不再进行重大的基本建设，个别的高等学校可以内迁。接近沿海地区的学校，要适当地缩小将来的发展规模，少作扩建。原来计划在沿海城市建立的高等学校，除了特殊情形，如像造船学院必须设在沿海城市以外，应改在内地建设。高等学校的院系调整工作，应有计划有步骤地进行，防止盲目性。同时应根据新建工业和整个国民经济建设的要求，适当地增建新的学校。在建校和进行院系调整时，应该注意贯彻学校要和相近生产企业等有关部门相结合的原则，例如工科院校要跟同性质的工业中心、综合大学要跟科学研究中心、农林院校应该同农业生产经济区域规划要求结合起来，以便使学校的教学工作、科学研究和生产实习密切联系实际。
    在改变现有学校的地区分布的过程中，必须注意掌握下列原则：第一，根据我国社会主义长远建设的利益和高等学校今后长远发展的要求，要有一个切合实际的统盘的计划，从一九五五年度起，逐步地加以实施；既要照顾到今天可能遇到的各种困难，又要服从长远建设的要求。当两者发生矛盾时，要克服目前的困难，服从长远建设的利益。第二，要充分注意发挥沿海城市现有学校人力、物力的潜力，使这些学校一方面能为国家培养质量较好的建设人材，另一方面能在人力、物力上大力支援新建的学校，其中特别是在师资力量的补充上应给予更多的帮助。沿海城市的学校应把支援新建学校当作自己的光荣的政治任务。内地新建学校要尽可能地防止过于集中的现象，并注意避免操之过急。
    合理部署高等学校的地区分布，是艰巨而复杂的工作，要足够地认识工作中的困难，并且首先要有艰苦奋斗、克服困难的精神。例如有些学校，各项工作开始纳入计划轨道，一旦进行院系调整，势必会部分地打乱原来的教学秩序，或多或少地影响到教学改革的进行和教学质量的提高，有些学校因为需要重新组织教学工作，难于按时完成教学计划；内地城市工业建设任务较重，高等学校新建时，可能在基本建设和交通运输方面遇到不少的困难。
    为着把合理部署高等学校的地区分布工作做得更好，必须向各方有关人员进行思想动员工作。首先要反复说明合理部署高等学校的地区分布的重大意义，指出这项工作对国家整个建设事业、高等学校本身的发展都是很有利的。为了国家的长远利益，各方应该积极协力，克服困难。并说明内地城市的新建和扩建，是依照着社会主义城市规划的原则来进行的，今天的市政建设条件虽然暂时还不如沿海城市，但将来，各种市政建设的安排和布置将比沿海城市更合理些。以鼓励沿海城市教育工作者到内地工作。
    其次，由于迁校和院系调整，在教学上和生活上都会发生各种各样的困难，领导方面固然应该考虑尽可能地少动或不动。但要向大家指出：我国的新建工业大都分布在内地，这些工业的设备最新，工程技术人员也较多，学校和工厂可以互相帮助，更有利于生产和教学工作。又如由于院系调整，某些学校的师资、行政领导骨干、教学设备和基本建设面积都有或多或少的变动，这就要反复向大家说明：原有学校只有像我国原有厂矿企业大力支援新建厂矿企业一样地来支援内地，才算全面地完成国家所给予的任务。因此，各校都应该树立起互相帮助的整体观念。总之，大家都应该从祖国建设的需要出发，使高等学校院系合理部署的工作得以顺利地进行。
    高等教育领导部门应当会同有关业务部门研究出一个统盘安排的计划；同时，有关学校要及时配合进行必要的准备工作。例如，个别准备内迁的学校，应该及时抽调得力的行政领导骨干和学有专长的师资，组织一支能够进行建校工作和组织教学工作的队伍，以便一到新地区，就能迅速按照教学计划进行教学工作。内地原有的学校一方面进行必要的扩建，一方面应充分发挥各方面的潜力，尽可能地分担较多的招生任务。在基本建设中应按照中央关于开展全面节约运动的指示，尽可能地利用当地的材料和施工力量，争取早日施工，使新建校舍及时完工。此外，各有关高等学校要依靠各地中共省、市党委和政府的领导、帮助，大力解决院系调整中的各种困难。
    全国高等学校都应当从整体利益出发，在党的领导下，通力合作，克服困难，以便使我国高等学校的地区分布逐步趋于合理。
