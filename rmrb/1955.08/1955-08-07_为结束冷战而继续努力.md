On August 4th, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, N.A. Bulganin, delivered a report to the Third Session of the Fourth Supreme Soviet of the USSR on the results of the Geneva Four-Power Summit. This report demonstrated the enormous role and brilliant achievements of the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy in safeguarding world peace. It provided strong support and great encouragement to the people of all countries who are working to continue easing international tensions, resolving pressing international issues, and ending the "Cold War."

Bulganin gave a correct assessment of the achievements of the Geneva Four-Power Conference. He pointed out that the Geneva Conference was a significant historical event, marking a turning point in the relations between the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France; all participants in the conference demonstrated a desire to strive for positive results. He believed that the results of the Geneva Conference could be appropriately regarded as a major step forward in the direction of peace and ending the "Cold War."

The success of the Geneva Conference was inseparable from the efforts of the people of all countries to strive for peace and the Soviet Union's adherence to a peaceful foreign policy. The strong desire of the people of all countries to end the "Cold War" and eliminate the threat of a new war has become a powerful factor in current international politics. This demand for peace from the people has created an irresistible pressure on the governments of all countries, enabling the Geneva Conference to be held and achieve positive results. As Bulganin pointed out, the Geneva Conference "must be regarded as a definite achievement of the forces of peace." U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, in a speech after the Geneva Conference, also said that everyone in Geneva felt "a great pressure to make constructive progress, and not just repeat the lifeless performance of the past, the negative performance." Now, peace-loving people around the world are further strengthening their efforts to strive for peace. The World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held in Hiroshima, Japan, on August 6th is a manifestation of this effort.

In their struggle for peace, the people of all countries have consistently received the greatest encouragement from the achievements of the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy. In analyzing the international situation on the eve of the Geneva Conference, Bulganin listed the measures taken by the Soviet Union to ease international tensions and restore trust between countries. These measures were fully in line with the interests of safeguarding peace and the security of the people of all countries, and were warmly welcomed and enthusiastically supported by the people of all countries, greatly strengthening their confidence in the struggle to maintain peace and prevent the threat of a new war, thereby preparing favorable conditions for the holding of the Geneva Conference.

The peaceful foreign policy pursued by the Soviet Union fully proves that the Soviet Union is a peace-loving country. As can be seen from Bulganin's report, even in the context of having to strengthen its armed forces due to other countries' stepped-up arms expansion and war preparations, the Soviet Union's military spending in 1955 still only accounted for about 20 percent of its total budget expenditure. In contrast, the United States' direct military expenditure in the 1953-54 fiscal year accounted for 68.6 percent of the federal budget expenditure. The Chinese people fully support the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy and also resolutely implement a policy of striving for the noble goals of world peace and human progress in their own foreign policy. Under the condition of the existence of foreign military threats, China's defense expenditure in 1955 accounted for only 24.19 percent of the total budget expenditure. This fact alone is sufficient to illustrate the Chinese people's desire for peace.

In his report, Bulganin elaborated on the proposals and opinions put forward by the Soviet delegation at the Geneva Conference on the issues of ensuring European security, the German question, disarmament, and developing contacts between East and West. The Soviet Union's proposals and opinions on various issues demonstrate the Soviet Union's tireless efforts for the great cause of consolidating world peace, and at the same time are full of a pragmatic spirit that proceeds from the actual situation and strives to gradually make progress in resolving pressing international issues. Therefore, the Soviet Union's propositions and proposals on various issues are practical and feasible, and are in line with the noble goals of maintaining European and world peace and security. At the same time, Bulganin also stated that the Soviet Union is willing to consider the sincere opinions of other countries. He specifically mentioned British Prime Minister Eden's opinion on concluding a security pact involving a relatively small number of countries and U.S. President Eisenhower's proposal on organizing the exchange of military intelligence between the Soviet Union and the United States and conducting mutual aerial photography over each other's territory. The Chinese people fully support the Soviet Union's proposals and opinions, and believe that at the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference to be held in October, it should be possible to seek agreement on major issues, taking into account the legitimate interests of all parties concerned.

The Chinese people warmly welcome Bulganin's opinions on the situation in Asia and the Far East and the Soviet government's support for the Chinese government's initiatives to ease the situation in Asia and the Far East. The Soviet government has consistently worked to maintain peace in Asia, and this effort has played, and continues to play, a significant role in easing the situation in Asia. At present, after the Geneva Four-Power Conference, there is a great possibility of easing the explosive situation in the Far East with the spirit of understanding and cooperation embodied in the Geneva Conference. The Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks, which began in Geneva on August 1st, are proceeding under favorable conditions. Obviously, as long as both sides adopt a conciliatory and sincere attitude of consultation in the spirit of "negotiation, not force" of the Geneva Conference, then this meeting can open up a favorable path for resolving the problems of Asia and the Far East.

However, as Bulganin pointed out, there are some forces that are trying to obstruct the establishment of international trust and the consolidation of peace. While the Sino-U.S. talks are underway, many voices that are extremely inconsistent with the current international atmosphere have been heard from across the Pacific. Some people are still advocating showing "strength." Some people even want people to believe that there are no "prepared conditions" for solving problems in Asia like in Europe. All this shows that on the road to a peaceful solution to the Far East question, peace-loving people of all countries still need to make greater efforts.

In his report, Bulganin pointed out a major task to the peace-loving people of the world, that is, they must, with an unwavering and tenacious spirit, make persistent efforts to strive for peace and for achieving positive results in future discussions and resolutions of outstanding international issues, so as to carry the struggle to end the "Cold War" that began at the Geneva Conference to the end. Bulganin stated that the Soviet Union will firmly stand with the people of all countries and spare no effort to ensure that the resolutions of the Geneva Conference are implemented in favor of universal peace and security. This attitude of the Soviet Union will undoubtedly be welcomed by the people of all countries and greatly inspire their confidence and determination to carry the cause of maintaining peace to the end. The Chinese people, who are working to ease tensions in Asia and the Far East, will contribute all their strength to the cause of consolidating peace together with the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of all countries.

### 为结束冷战而继续努力

    为结束冷战而继续努力
    八月四日，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在第四届苏联最高苏维埃第三次会议上作了关于日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的结果的报告。这个报告显示了苏联的和平外交政策在维护世界和平的事业中所起的巨大的作用和已经取得的光辉成就，它给予正在为继续缓和国际紧张局势、解决迫切的国际问题和结束“冷战”而努力的各国人民以坚决的支持和极大的鼓舞。
    布尔加宁对四大国日内瓦会议所取得的成就作了正确的估价。他指出，日内瓦会议是重大的历史事件，它标志着苏、美、英、法四国关系上的转折点；会议所有参加者都表现了争取积极结果的愿望。他认为日内瓦会议的结果可以恰当地被认为是朝着和平和结束“冷战”的方向前进的一个重大步骤。
    日内瓦会议所以能够取得这样的成就，是同世界各国人民争取和平的努力和苏联坚持和平外交政策分不开的。各国人民要求结束“冷战”、消除新战争威胁的强烈愿望，已经成为当前国际政治中一个强有力的因素。人民的这种和平的要求对于一切国家的政府形成了一种不可抗拒的压力，使得日内瓦会议得以举行并且取得了积极的结果。正如布尔加宁所指出的，日内瓦会议“必须被认为是和平力量的肯定的成就”。美国总统艾森豪威尔在日内瓦会议以后发表的演说中也说，在日内瓦的每一个人都感到“有一种很大的压力，要求作出建设性的进展，而不仅仅是重复过去那种无生气的表演、消极的表演”。现在，全世界爱好和平的人民正在进一步加强他们争取和平的努力。八月六日在日本广岛举行的禁止原子弹、氢弹世界大会，就是这种努力的一个表现。
    各国人民在他们争取和平的斗争中，一贯从苏联的和平外交政策所取得的成就中得到最大的鼓舞。布尔加宁在分析日内瓦会议前夕的国际形势时列述了苏联为缓和国际局势和恢复国家间的信任而采取的措施。这些措施完全符合于保障和平和各国人民的安全的利益，得到了各国人民的衷心欢迎和热烈支持，大大加强了他们在维护和平、制止新战争威胁的斗争中的信心，从而为日内瓦会议的举行准备了有利的条件。
    苏联所奉行的和平外交政策，充分证明苏联是一个爱好和平的国家。从布尔加宁的报告中可以看出，苏联在由于其他国家加紧扩军备战而不得不加强自己武装部队的情况下，一九五五年的军事费用仍然只占预算总支出的百分之二十左右。而美国在一九五三—五四财政年度中的直接军费就占联邦预算支出的百分之六十八点六。中国人民完全支持苏联的和平外交政策，并且在自己的外交政策方面也坚决执行着为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力的方针。在存在着外国军事威胁的条件下，中国一九五五年国防费的支出只占预算支出总数的百分之二十四点一九。这个事实就足够说明中国人民的爱好和平的意愿。
    布尔加宁在他的报告中申述了苏联代表团在日内瓦会议上就保障欧洲安全问题、德国问题、裁军问题和发展东西方之间接触问题所提出的建议和意见。苏联在各项问题上的建议和意见表现了苏联对于巩固世界和平的伟大事业的孜孜不倦的努力，同时充满着从现实情况出发、力求逐步在解决迫切的国际问题上取得进展的实事求是的精神。因此，苏联在各项问题上的主张和建议都是切实可行的，并且是符合于维护欧洲和世界的和平和安全的崇高目的的。同时，布尔加宁也表示，苏联愿意考虑其他国家的具有诚意的意见。他具体地提到英国首相艾登的关于缔结比较少数国家参加的安全公约的意见和美国艾森豪威尔总统的关于组织交换苏联和美国之间的军事情报和在双方领土上互相进行空中摄影的建议。中国人民完全支持苏联的建议和意见，并且认为在十月间举行的四国外长会议上，应该有可能考虑到有关各方的利益而在各项重大问题上求得协议。
    中国人民热烈欢迎布尔加宁关于亚洲和远东局势方面的意见和苏联政府对于中国政府为和缓亚洲和远东局势所采取的主动的支持。苏联政府一贯为维护亚洲的和平而努力，这种努力对缓和亚洲的局势曾经起了、并且还在起着重大的作用。目前，在日内瓦四大国会议以后，以在日内瓦会议上所体现的谅解和合作的精神来和缓远东的爆炸性的局势，有着极大的可能性。从八月一日起在日内瓦举行的中美大使级会谈，正在有利的条件下进行。显然，只要双方本着日内瓦会议的“谈判，而不是武力”的精神，采取和解的诚意协商的态度，那末这次会谈就能为解决亚洲和远东问题开辟有利的途径。
    但是，正如布尔加宁所指出的，有一些势力正在企图阻挠建立国际间的信任和巩固和平。在中美会谈正在进行的时候，从太平洋彼岸发出了不少同当前国际气氛极不协调的声音。有人还在主张显示“实力”。有人甚至想要人们相信，在亚洲并不存在像欧洲那样的解决问题的“准备条件”。这一切都说明了：在和平解决远东问题的道路上，爱好和平的各国人民还需要作更大的努力。
    布尔加宁在他的报告中向全世界爱好和平的人民指出了一个重大的任务，这就是必须以坚定不移的顽强的精神，再接再厉地为争取和平、为在今后讨论和解决悬而未决的国际问题方面取得积极结果而努力，以便把从日内瓦会议开始的结束“冷战”的斗争进行到底。布尔加宁表示：苏联将坚决地和各国人民站在一起，不惜一切力量使日内瓦会议的决议得以实现，以有利于普遍和平和安全。苏联的这种态度无疑将受到各国人民的欢迎，并大大激厉他们的把维护和平的事业进行到底的信心和决心。正在为谋求缓和亚洲和远东紧张局势而努力的中国人民，将同苏联以及爱好和平的各国人民一起，为巩固和平的事业而贡献出自己的一切力量。
