Communist Youth League Tianjin Municipal Committee Holds "Raise Revolutionary Vigilance" Evening Event

On the evening of the 5th, more than 3,000 young workers, students, and government cadres gathered at the Tianjin Youth Palace to participate in the "Raise Revolutionary Vigilance" evening event held by the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League.

In the hall of the Youth Palace, the young people viewed the exhibition "Thoroughly Smash the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique, Eliminate All Hidden Counter-Revolutionary Elements." This exhibition displayed many cartoons exposing the various counter-revolutionary activities of the Hu Feng group, as well as pictures of six cases of American-Chiang Kai-shek spies and counter-revolutionary elements sabotaging economic construction that were cracked in Tianjin. From these pictures, the young people learned about the crimes of the counter-revolutionary element Zhu Xiu, who infiltrated the state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant and used the name of a technician to sabotage production, causing the loss of 600,000 yuan of state assets; and the counter-revolutionary element Wang Quan, who infiltrated the Caozhuang Township Progressive Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Tianjin to sabotage agricultural production and attempt to undermine the agricultural production cooperative.

The young people also watched the film "Cannot Forget This Event" in the open-air square, and some watched the drama "Battle on the Coast" in the small theater, which depicted the struggle against the enemy on the coastal defense front. (Xinhua News Agency)

    青年团天津市委举办“提高革命警惕性”晚会
    五日晚上，三千多名青年工人、学生和机关干部成群结队地来到天津青年宫，参加中国新民主主义青年团天津市委员会举办的“提高革命警惕性”晚会。
    在青年宫的大厅里，青年们观看了“彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团、肃清一切暗藏反革命分子”展览会。这个展览会展出很多幅揭露胡风集团各种反革命活动的漫画，和关于天津市破获的六起美蒋特务和反革命分子破坏经济建设的案件的图片。从这些图片中，青年们了解到反革命分子朱修混入国营天津钢厂，利用技术员的名义破坏生产使国家资财受到六十万元的损失；反革命分子王泉混入天津市郊区曹庄乡进步农业生产合作社破坏农业生产，并企图搞垮农业生产合作社等罪行。
    青年们还在露天广场上观看了影片“不能忘记这件事”，有的在小剧场观看了描写海防前线对敌的斗争话剧“海滨激战”。　（新华社）
