Shanghai Transfers Large Quantities of Autumn and Winter Goods

Shanghai's state-owned commercial departments are transferring a large quantity of goods needed for the autumn and winter peak season market to various parts of the country. The transfer started in July. Currently, an average of 3,000 tons of general merchandise, fabrics, cigarettes, medicines, and other commodities are shipped out daily by rail, the Yangtze River, and sea. Since the third quarter, the purchasing and supply stations of state-owned department stores and cotton yarn and fabric companies in Shanghai, with the support of the railway department, have organized thirty "collective direct trains," all loaded with industrial products, directly to Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Jinan, Zhuzhou and other places. The autumn and winter goods prepared for shipment in August, such as flannel shirts, flannel pants, woolen yarn, cotton socks, vanishing cream, and dark cotton cloth, will increase by 7% to 200% compared to July.

The purchasing and supply stations of the department store and cotton yarn and fabric companies have adopted many methods to make the variety, patterns, and specifications of goods suitable for the different needs of consumers in various regions. The purchasing and supply station of the department store company has matched the colors of socks and woolen yarn according to the color schemes proposed by the ordering units in various places; it has also changed the previous method of supplying adult rubber shoes according to a fixed ratio of sizes. Leather-style women's galoshes, favored by women in Fujian Province, have been adequately supplied this time. The purchasing and supply station of the cotton yarn and fabric company has appropriately increased the supply of goods such as small-patterned serge, khaki, and indigo blue cloth, which are popular among farmers, and has established sample communication links with 283 domestic business units, arranging production and supply based on the opinions of various places on the patterns and colors of cotton cloth.

    上海市调出大批秋冬商品
    上海市国营商业部门把大量秋后旺季市场需要的物资，调往全国各地。调运是从七月份开始的。目前平均每天有三千吨日用百货、布匹、卷烟、药品等商品从铁路、长江和海上运出。第三季度以来，国营百货、花纱布等公司在上海的采购供应站，在铁道部门支持下，组织了三十次“集体直达列车”，全部装载工业品，直接运往西安、郑州、济南、株州等地。八月份准备运出的绒衣、绒裤、毛线、棉毛袜、雪花膏和深色棉布等秋冬令用品，将比七月份增加百分之七到百分之二百。
    百货、花纱布两个公司的采购供应站，采取许多方法使商品的品种、花色、规格适合各地消费者不同的需要。百货公司的采购供应站在供应袜子和毛线方面，已根据各地要货单位提出的配色单搭配花色；对成人胶鞋，也改变了过去按固定比例搭配大小尺码的供应方法。福建省妇女喜爱的皮鞋式女套鞋，这次得到了充分供应。花纱布公司的采购供应站适当增加了农民喜欢的小花哔叽、卡其、士林蓝布等商品的供应量，并同国内二百八十三个经营单位建立样品通讯联系，根据各地对棉布花型、色泽提出的意见，布置生产和供应。（新华社）
