The Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China recently issued a notice on vigorously mobilizing the masses to store livestock fodder. The notice pointed out: Storing fodder is one of the important measures to ensure the health of livestock and improve the rate of livestock reproduction. Now that wild grass is flourishing and the autumn harvest is approaching, all localities must seize the time, organize the masses, and earnestly do a good job in the harvesting and storage of fodder. Both agricultural and pastoral areas should repeatedly explain to the masses the importance of storing fodder for enhancing the strength of draft animals, reducing livestock deaths, and ensuring production development, and list the harvesting and storage of fodder as one of the central tasks of summer and autumn production. In agricultural areas, rice straw and grain straw are the main fodder and should be carefully harvested and properly preserved. Corn stalks, corn cobs, and sweet potato vines can also be used to feed pigs and cattle. Other materials such as sorghum bottom leaves, cotton leaves, cotton seed husks, and various bean stalks should also be harvested and stored in a timely manner for cattle and pig feed. All localities should also, according to local conditions, plan to mobilize women and children to vigorously collect wild grass, wild vegetables, tree fruits, and aquatic plants in lakes and ponds that can be used as fodder should also be stored. The notice requires agricultural production cooperatives to take the lead in storing fodder, and to drive the broad masses of mutual aid teams and individual farmers to carry out the work of storing fodder more widely.

Regarding the work of harvesting and storing fodder in pastoral areas, the notice pointed out that in areas where there is no habit of cutting grass, typical examples should be actively cultivated to lead and demonstrate, and the work of storing grass should be gradually promoted. In areas where wind and snow disasters frequently occur, it is even more important to vigorously mobilize and organize herdsmen to store supplementary fodder during wind and snow periods. Grassland work stations and machine mowing stations with mowing machines should actively assist herdsmen's work by lending and renting, and strengthen technical guidance. State-owned farms should actively take the lead in demonstrating and doing a good job in their own fodder storage work, and provide nearby herdsmen with tool and technical assistance.

    农业部通知各地发动群众贮备牲畜饲草
    中华人民共和国农业部最近发出关于大力发动群众贮备牲畜饲草的通知。通知指出：贮备饲草是保障牲畜健康、提高牲畜增殖率的重要措施之一，现在野草繁茂，秋收就要到来，各地必须抓紧时间，组织群众，切实做好饲草收割贮存工作。农、牧业区都应反复向群众说明贮存饲草对增强耕畜体力、减少牲畜死亡、保证生产发展的重要意义，并将割贮饲草列为夏秋生产的中心任务之一。农业区稻草、谷草是主要饲草，应细心收割，妥为保存。玉米秸、玉米穗轴及薯藤还可以喂猪、牛。其他如高粱底叶、棉叶和棉壳和各种豆秸等都应适时割取贮存，以备牛猪饲用。各地还应根据当地条件，有计划地发动妇女儿童，大力收集野草、野菜、树实，湖泊池塘中可作饲草的水草亦应加以贮存。通知要求各地农业生产合作社在贮存饲草中要起带头作用，带动广大互助组和个体农民，更广泛地开展贮备饲草的工作。
    关于牧业区割贮饲草的工作，通知指出在没有割草习惯的地区，应积极培养典型带头示范，逐步推行贮草工作。在经常发生风雪等灾害地区更应大力动员和组织牧民贮存风雪期间的补充饲草。有马拉割草机的草原工作站和机器割草站，应以出借出租等方式积极协助牧民工作，并加强技术指导。国营牧场应积极带头示范作好本场贮草工作，并给附近牧民以工具、技术的援助。
