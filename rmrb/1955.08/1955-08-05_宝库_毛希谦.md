    "Treasure Trove"
    Mao Xiqian
    In the Gui Zhou Province Transport Machinery Repair Plant, electrician Master Shen Lin led me to visit their "treasure trove" – boxes of old car generators and motor armatures, piles of old insulated wires and old copper wires. Shen Lin told me: Don't look down on this scrap metal; it has become our treasure, and the comrades cherish it very much. Usually, whether we are going to work or getting off work, as long as we see old waste materials related to car electrical components, we will definitely pick them up and never let them be wasted.
    One day in March this year, Shen Lin passed by the entrance of the foundry workshop and saw some people smashing a pile of old car generator housings. He was surprised and went over to ask:
      "Why are you smashing them?"
    "This is scrap iron sent by the materials section, and it's being smashed so it can be melted back into iron." The comrade smashing the iron answered him.
    "No, no, these are useful things. Don't smash them. I'll take responsibility for explaining it clearly to the materials section."
    Shen Lin quickly ran to discuss it with his comrades in the group. Then he went to ask the materials section. It turned out that the comrades transporting the scrap iron didn't know and mixed them in as scrap iron. After sorting them out, there were more than a hundred.
    Why does Shen Lin cherish these things so much? It turns out that he often uses them when he lacks parts for repairing generators or motors.
    In April this year, the comrades in the materials section came to discuss with the electrician group, asking them to find a way to repair ten generators because the Guizhou Province Agricultural and Forestry Department's Water Conservancy Bureau had bought ten engines from their factory, preparing to transport them to the countryside to pump water and support the production of farmer brothers. Everything was complete except for ten generators. At this time, Shen Lin thought of that batch of old generator housings and had an idea. He thought: Supporting the production of farmer brothers is our responsibility. If we put in a little effort, the farmer brothers will get great help in production. So, he discussed with the comrades in the group to "squeeze some time to get it done." The group leader and comrades all supported his opinion. Shen Lin went to the "treasure trove" to pick out ten generator housings, and found some magnetic field armatures here and there. With the help of the comrades, he finally repaired the ten generators.
    Their factory repairs Hungarian diesel vehicles. When they encounter difficulties due to a lack of materials, he rummages through the "treasure trove" and finds parts from other diesel vehicles that can be installed on the Hungarian diesel vehicle motors. From then on, they found a way to repair Hungarian diesel vehicles. Once, a part on the motor of a large 25-ton trailer broke down. Replacing it with several new ones didn't work. Shen Lin found an old one in the "treasure trove" and replaced it. As a result, the big trailer drove out of the factory with a roar, undertaking the transportation task.
    Recently, the materials section notified them again that the Water Conservancy Bureau needed more than a dozen generators. Shen Lin thought for a moment and said with confidence, "We already have seven or eight on hand, and it won't be a problem to put together a few more."

    “宝库”
    毛希谦
    在贵州省交通机械修配厂里，电工小组沈琳师傅领着我参观了他们的“宝库”——一箱箱的旧汽车发电机、马达心子，一堆堆的旧皮线、旧铜线。沈琳告诉我：别看这是烂铜烂铁，它已成了我们的宝贝，同志们都很爱惜它。平时，我们无论是出去工作或上下班，只要看见汽车上电气方面的旧废料，就一定捡回来，绝不让它们白白地浪费掉。
    今年三月间的一天，沈琳从翻砂车间门口经过，看见一些人把一堆旧的汽车发电机外壳敲碎，他便惊奇地过去问：
      “你们把它敲碎做什么？”
    “这是材料科送来的废铁，敲碎了好回炉化铁水。”敲铁的同志回答他。
    “不行，不行，这是有用的东西，你们不要敲，我负责去和材料科讲清楚。”
    沈琳很快跑去同小组的同志商量后，就去问材料科。原来是运废铁的同志不知道，把它们当成废铁混起来，后来一清，足足一百多个。
    沈琳为什么这样爱护这些东西呢？原来他在修理发电机或马达缺乏零件时，常常利用它们。
    今年四月间，材料科的同志来和电工组商量，要电工组想办法整修十个发电机，因为贵州省农林厅水利局向他们厂里买了十部引擎，准备运下乡打水，支援农民弟兄生产，样样都齐全了，就差十个发电机。这时，沈琳想到了那批旧发电机外壳，心里有了主意。他想：支援农民弟兄生产是我们的责任。我们费点力，农民弟兄在生产上就能得到很大的帮助。于是，他就和组里的同志商量“挤点时间搞出来”。组长和同志们都支持他的意见。沈琳到“宝库”里挑出了十个发电机外壳，东一点西一点地又找来了磁场心子，在同志们的帮助下，终于把十个发电机修整好。
    他们厂修理匈牙利柴油汽车，遇到缺乏材料的困难，他就在“宝库”里翻到了其他柴油车上的零件，刚好可以装在匈牙利柴油车马达上。从此，就给修理匈牙利柴油车找到了办法。一次，载重二十五吨的一辆大拖车的马达上的零件坏了，换上几个新的都不行，沈琳到“宝库”里找了一个旧的换上，结果大拖车唬唬地开出厂去，担负起运输任务。
    最近，材料科又通知说，水利局还需要十几部发电机，沈琳想了一下，有把握地说：“手边已有七八部，再凑几部不成问题。”
