Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 11th: The special agent Yang Jinxing, who murdered General Yang Hucheng and Luo Shiwen, the person in charge of the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee during the Anti-Japanese War, as well as many revolutionary workers, was arrested by public security organs in Qingju Township, Nanchong County, Sichuan Province on June 17th this year. Since early 1950, the criminal Yang had fled to Sancun, Qingju Township, and used various disguises to hide in this remote village for more than five years. Yang Jinxing was a KMT secret agent, who had served as the adjutant of the secret service boss Dai Li, and the warden of the Baigongguan Detention Center (KMT concentration camp) of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization. In 1946, the criminal Yang, together with another secret agent, shot and killed Luo Shiwen, Che Yaoxian and others, persons in charge of the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee, with pistols in the Songlinpo parking lot of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, and burned the bodies with gasoline and wood to destroy the evidence. In September 1949, the criminal Yang, together with another special agent, murdered General Yang Hucheng and his son, young daughter, and Yang Hucheng’s secretary Song Qiyun and his wife in the Daigongci of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization. In November of the same year, when the KMT bandits and secret agents collectively massacred revolutionary workers in the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, the criminal Yang, carrying a submachine gun, directed the bandits in the detention center to shoot and kill unarmed revolutionary workers everywhere. In Songlinpo alone, the criminal Yang personally shot and killed thirty-two people.

On the eve of the liberation of Chongqing, the criminal Yang led a group of secret agents to flee to northern Sichuan, attempting to organize guerrilla forces. After being dispersed by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Nanchong, these bandits hid in the countryside.

The criminal Yang settled down in Sancun, Qingju Township, Nanchong County, and changed his name to Yang Dafa. The criminal Yang disguised himself as an active participant in all aspects, and gained the trust of village cadres and farmers. During the rent reduction and deposit refund campaign and the land reform, he was rated as a "poor peasant" and was allocated land and one dan (石) of grain. He took out five dou (斗) from it and donated it to the farmers' association as a fund, thus winning praise. In 1952, when the village organized mutual aid teams, he "took the lead" in participating, and also "actively" promoted the benefits of mutual aid teams. For a time, the village was deceived into regarding him as an "activist." However, the eyes of the masses are discerning. During the five years, local farmers constantly reported Yang Jinxing's suspicious actions to the public security organs. Now, this heinous counter-revolutionary element with countless blood debts has finally been arrested. This is truly a gratifying event.

    杀害杨虎城和罗世文等的特务杨进兴落网
    新华社成都十一日电　杀害杨虎城将军和抗日战争时期中共四川省委员会负责人罗世文以及许多革命工作人员的特务分子杨进兴，今年六月十七日在四川省南充县青居乡被公安机关逮捕了。杨犯从一九五零年初逃到青居乡三村，用各种伪装手法在这个偏僻村子里暗藏了五年多。杨进兴是军统特务，曾任特务头子戴笠的侍从副官、中美合作所白公馆看守所（军统集中营）看守长等职务。一九四六年，杨犯在中美合作所松林坡停车场和另一特务用手枪杀害了中共四川省委负责人罗世文、车耀先等，并用汽油、木材烧尸灭迹。一九四九年九月，杨犯同另一特务在中美合作所戴公祠内，杀害了杨虎城将军和他的儿子、幼女，以及杨虎城将军的秘书宋绮云夫妇。同年十一月，国民党匪特们在中美合作所集体屠杀革命工作人员时，杨犯手提机枪指挥看守所匪徒们，到处枪杀手无寸铁的革命工作人员。仅在松林坡一地，杨犯就亲手枪杀了三十二人。
    重庆解放前夕，杨犯率领一批特务潜逃川北，企图组织游击武装，在南充被中国人民解放军击散后，这批匪徒便到农村潜伏起来。
    杨犯在南充县青居乡三村定居下来，改名杨大发。杨犯从各方面伪装积极，骗取村干部和农民的信任。在减租退押和土地改革中，他被评为“贫农”，分得了田地和一石谷子，他从中拿出五斗来捐给农民协会做基金，骗得了赞扬。一九五二年村里组织互助组，他“带头”参加，还“积极”宣传互助组的好处，村上一时受骗把他当作“积极分子”。但群众的眼睛是雪亮的，当地农民在五年多期间不断地将杨进兴的可疑行动密告给公安机关，现在这个罪大恶极血债累累的反革命分子终于落网了。这真是一件大快人心的事。
