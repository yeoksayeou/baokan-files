Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 8th. The Indonesian "People's Daily" published on August 8th a statement made to the press by the General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, Aidit, regarding the cabinet issue.

    The statement called for the formation of a cabinet that could achieve national peace and be comprised of all parties represented in parliament, including the Masyumi Party and the Indonesian Communist Party. The statement said: "Of course, such a cabinet would not be led by the Masyumi Party and the Socialist Party. Such a cabinet should guarantee national peace and security and ensure the continued pursuit of an independent foreign policy. The work of this cabinet will focus on normalizing relations between the government and the army and conducting truly free and fair general elections according to the scheduled date."

    The statement further said that organizing a Masyumi Party cabinet would be contrary to the wishes of the majority of the people and their long-held ideal of national peace.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 8th. The Indonesian "People's Daily" reported on August 8th that the Indonesian Communist Party held a national representative conference and a plenary session of the Central Committee from the 5th to the 7th.

    In his report, the General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, Aidit, after analyzing the international and domestic situation, emphasized the importance of strengthening the national front and conducting general elections. Aidit said: "The upcoming general election is extremely important. Otherwise, the imperialists will organize a 'holy alliance' among themselves and, together with domestic reactionaries, overthrow the Ali-Arifin cabinet in order to obstruct the general election or at least prevent it from being conducted under the auspices of the Ali-Arifin cabinet, which enjoys the support of the people." Aidit said: "Obviously, the collapse of the Ali-Arifin cabinet is not only due to the machinations of domestic reactionaries but also to the political tricks played by external forces."

    Aidit called on the broad masses of working people not to allow a reactionary government to be established. He said that a complex struggle surrounding the formation of a new government is underway. Every effort must be made to ensure that the new government can be established on the broadest possible basis.

    印度尼西亚共产党总书记
    艾地发表关于内阁问题的声明
    新华社雅加达八日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”八日刊载了印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地对报界发表的关于内阁问题的声明。
    声明要求组织一个能够实现全国和平、并且由在国会中有代表的各政党——包括马斯友美党和印度尼西亚共产党在内——都参加的内阁。声明说：“当然，这样的内阁将不由马斯友美党和社会党领导。这样的内阁应当是以保证国家的和平和安全，并且保证继续奉行独立的外交政策。这个内阁的工作将着重于政府和陆军之间关系的正常化，并且按照预定日期进行真正自由和公正的普选。”
    声明又说，组织马斯友美党内阁是违反大多数人民的愿望和他们长久以来所怀抱的全国和平的理想的。
    新华社雅加达八日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”八日报道，印度尼西亚共产党在五日到七日举行了全国代表会议和中央委员会全体会议。
    印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地在报告中在分析了国际和国内局势之后强调指出加强民族阵线和进行普选的重要性。艾地说：“行将举行的普选极关重要。否则，帝国主义者不会在他们当中组织‘神圣联盟’并且和国内反动派一道，推翻阿里—阿里芬内阁，以便阻挠普选或者至少使普选不能在得到人民支持的阿里—阿里芬内阁的主持下进行。”艾地说：“显然，阿里—阿里芬内阁的垮台不仅仅是由于国内反动派的策动，而且也是由于外界力量玩弄的政治诡计。”
    艾地号召广大的劳动人民群众不要让一个反动的政府得以成立。他说，围绕着成立新政府的复杂斗争正在进行。必须尽一切努力，使新的政府能在最广泛的基础上成立起来。
