　　Immediately Stop the Massacre of the Moroccan People
　　Tan Wenrui
    Due to the French authorities' refusal to recognize the Moroccan people's right to independence and self-determination, and their attempt to maintain their colonial rule by force, the situation in Morocco has been tense for a long time. In recent days, French colonialists have carried out large-scale, frenzied suppression activities in Morocco and Algeria, killing 2,000 people since August 20th. With the bloodshed continuing, the situation in Morocco and the entire North Africa has further deteriorated.
    Since France declared Morocco a "protectorate" in 1912, French colonialists have wantonly plundered the rich mineral resources and fertile land of French Morocco, leaving the Moroccan people with poverty, backwardness, and death. Although Morocco has abundant natural resources, they are almost entirely controlled by foreign monopoly capital, becoming a source of wealth for them, while the true owners of these resources—the Moroccan people—receive no benefit whatsoever. In this country, almost all extracted raw materials are transported abroad. For example, in 1952, four million tons of phosphate fertilizer were extracted in Morocco, of which 3.9 million tons were exported, i.e., 98 percent; more than 90 percent of manganese ore, 96 percent of iron ore, and all cobalt and zinc ore were exported. By intensifying plunder and exploitation, the various foreign monopoly organizations dominating Morocco obtained increasingly huge profits. In 1951, the net profit announced by fourteen large French companies increased more than fivefold compared to 1947, reaching more than 25 billion francs. However, the Moroccan working people lived in poverty and hunger. Although the cost of living in Morocco was even higher than in France, most workers earned less than half of the minimum wage in France, and the wages of female and child laborers were even lower. The plight of the peasants was equally miserable. About 5,000 colonists occupied more than one million hectares of the most fertile land, while 1.3 million small farmers had a total of only four million hectares. Due to frequent crop failures and heavy taxes, farmers struggled to maintain a minimum standard of living. Nearly one million people starved to death in the famine years of 1937 and 1945. In Morocco, hundreds of thousands of people lived in squalid slums. Due to malnutrition, the health of the people was extremely poor. The infant mortality rate reached 75 percent, and one in every three Moroccans suffered from lung disease. The country's health services employed only 200 doctors, meaning there was only one doctor for every 45,000 urban residents or every 120,000 rural residents. The situation with education was even worse; of the nearly two million school-age children, less than 200,000 had the opportunity to attend school. At the same time, the basic human rights of the people were brutally violated. For the Moroccan working people, freedom of speech, assembly, or association did not exist. The martial law decree issued by the French authorities in 1939 had not been lifted, and residents were constantly at risk of being arrested and convicted. The oppression and suffering endured by the Moroccan people under the "protection" of the French colonialists are truly countless.
    It is clear that it is unimaginable for the Moroccan people to endure such a colonial system without resistance. In fact, the heroic Moroccan people have never ceased their struggle since the day they were deprived of their freedom and independence. By 1935, one-tenth of the Moroccan people had sacrificed their lives to resist French colonial rule. During and after the Second World War, as the people of many countries in Asia and Africa broke free from the shackles imposed on them by colonialists, achieving national independence and freedom, declaring the fate of the decadent colonial system to collapse, the Moroccan people's awareness was further raised. Moreover, due to the increasing strength of the working class, the Moroccan national liberation movement entered a new stage. Under the leadership of the Moroccan Communist Party, the Moroccan people put forward the slogan of demanding the abolition of the Treaty of Fez signed in 1912 and the abolition of the "protectorate" system, and launched an unyielding struggle for this goal. The Moroccan people's desire for national independence and freedom is legitimate and reasonable, but the French ruling clique stubbornly refuses to abandon its colonial interests in Morocco and other regions of North Africa, responding to the Moroccan people's demand for national independence with intensified brutal suppression and fascist terror rule. At the same time, the French authorities put forward so-called "reform policies" in an attempt to divide the Moroccan national liberation movement and consolidate its colonial rule, but none of this was able to subdue or deceive the Moroccan people. As the national movement continued to grow, the former Sultan of Morocco, Yusuf, also demanded that the French government re-examine the protection treaty and refused to sign the "reform" draft proposed by the French authorities. The French authorities, enraged, instigated an armed coup in August 1953, illegally deposed the Sultan of Morocco, Yusuf, and supported the thorough puppet, Arafa, as Sultan. This was followed by intensified suppression and persecution of the Moroccan people. This arrogant and vicious means of the French colonial authorities only made the Moroccan people more bravely launch a struggle of resistance. For two years, patriots throughout Morocco have continuously held demonstrations, strikes, and market strikes to express their will to fight for freedom. The French authorities still attempted to rely on violence to suppress the Moroccan people's national liberation struggle, intensifying their barbaric massacres, with bloody incidents occurring almost every day, thus making the situation in Morocco increasingly tense.
    During this period, the Moroccan Communist Party has repeatedly proposed that the French authorities should stop their suppression measures against Morocco and conduct negotiations with the true representatives of the Moroccan people on the basis of recognizing Morocco's national sovereignty and national independence; and pointed out that it is necessary to first stop conspiring with elements fostered by colonialists, abolish the protocol on political and administrative "reforms" that Sultan Yusuf was forced to sign in August 1953, abolish the so-called "reforms" that completely violate Moroccan sovereignty, and resolve the issue of the Sultan's throne before negotiations. However, the French authorities turned a deaf ear to this legitimate call, continued to implement a policy of violence, and carried out a large-scale bloody massacre of the Moroccan and Algerian people on the second anniversary of Sultan Yusuf's forced abdication. This completely exposed the barbaric and ferocious face of the French colonialists, making it impossible not to doubt how sincere the French authorities are in their recent expressions of willingness to resolve the Moroccan issue through negotiations.
    In fact, the so-called plan to solve the Moroccan problem recently drafted by the French government is not a genuine way to solve the problem. The French authorities clearly know that Sultan Arafa, who is in power under the protection of French bayonets, is a puppet despised by the Moroccan people, but they stubbornly refuse to consider the Moroccan people's desire for Sultan Yusuf to be reinstated, instead allowing Arafa to engage in a so-called government restructuring farce. Former French Prime Minister Pidault even openly clamored that Arafa should not be touched by a hair. How can this make people believe that the French government is truly willing to conduct sincere negotiations with the true representatives of the Moroccan people?
    Progressive people all over the world sympathize with and support the Moroccan people's struggle for national independence, and public opinion in various countries has repeatedly condemned the French colonialists' policy of suppression in Morocco. Arab countries have repeatedly accused France of its criminal acts in Morocco to the United Nations General Assembly. Recently, sixteen Asian and African countries jointly sent a letter to the United Nations Security Council, requesting it to use its power to address the Moroccan situation; pointing out that the situation created by the French adoption of severe suppression measures and terrorist actions in Morocco will inevitably cause extremely serious repercussions throughout Asia and Africa, and will intensify international tensions and endanger international peace and security. The massacre of the Moroccan people by the French colonialists since August 20th will naturally arouse even greater indignation among the people of all countries. The executioners who massacred the Moroccan people cannot escape the condemnation of world public opinion.
    The French colonialists should understand that no means of terrorist suppression can ever destroy or shake the will of the colonial people to fight for national independence. The French authorities must immediately stop the suppression of the Moroccan people and seek a reasonable solution to the Moroccan issue through genuine negotiations. Here, it is necessary to mention a sentence said by the General Secretary of the French Communist Party, Maurice Thorez: "France can be a friend and ally of all nations that are currently in the chains of national oppression, the only condition being the recognition of their complete independence."

　　立即停止对摩洛哥人民的屠杀
　　谭文瑞
    由于法国当局拒绝承认摩洛哥人民独立和自决的权利，企图用暴力来维持其殖民统治，摩洛哥的局势长期以来处于紧张的状态。最近几天，法国殖民者又在摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚进行了大规模的疯狂镇压活动，自八月二十日以来已经有二千人被杀死，流血冲突仍在继续，这就使得摩洛哥和整个北非的局势更加恶化。
    自从一九一二年法国宣布摩洛哥为“被保护国”以后，法国殖民者就肆意掠夺法属摩洛哥的丰富的矿藏和肥沃的土地，而给予摩洛哥人民的是贫困、落后和死亡。摩洛哥虽然有着大量的天然富源，但是它们几乎全为外国垄断资本所掌握，成为他们发财致富的泉源，而这些富源的真正主人——摩洛哥人民却得不到丝毫的利益。在这个国家内，差不多全部开采的原料都输往外国，例如一九五二年在摩洛哥开采了四百万吨的磷酸肥料，向国外输出的就达三百九十万吨，即百分之九十八；百分之九十以上的锰矿砂、百分之九十六的铁矿砂以及全部钴和锌矿砂都输往国外。靠了加紧掠夺和剥削，主宰摩洛哥的各个外国垄断组织获得了日益激增的巨额利润。一九五一年十四家法国大公司公布的纯利比一九四七年增加了五倍多，达二十五亿多法郎。但是摩洛哥的劳动人民却过着贫穷和饥饿的生活。虽然摩洛哥的生活费用甚至比法国还高，而大部分工人的收入不到法国最低工资的一半，女工和童工的工资则还要菲薄。农民的处境也同样悲惨。约五千名殖民者占有了一百余万公顷最肥沃的土地，而一百三十万名小农总共只有四百万公顷土地。由于经常的歉收和沉重的捐税，农民难以维持最低的生活。一九三七和一九四五两个荒年就曾饿死了将近一百万人。在摩洛哥，有好几十万人居住在肮脏不堪的贫民窟里。由于营养不良，人民的健康情况万分恶劣。婴儿死亡率达百分之七十五，每三个摩洛哥人中就有一个患肺病。而全国的卫生事业只雇用了二百个医生，这就是说，每四万五千城市居民或者每十二万乡村居民才有一个医生。教育情况就更不用说了，将近二百万学龄儿童中，只有不到二十万有上学的机会。同时，人民的基本的人权受到粗暴的蹂躏，对于摩洛哥劳动人民，言论、集会或结社的自由都是不存在的，法国当局一九三九年颁布的戒严令至今未解除，居民随时都有被拘捕和判罪的危险。摩洛哥人民在法国殖民者“保护”下所受的压迫和痛苦，真是罄竹难书。
    很显然，要摩洛哥人民忍受这样的殖民制度而不起来反抗，是不可想像的。事实上英勇的摩洛哥人民从他们被剥夺自由和独立之日起，就没有停止过斗争。到一九三五年止，曾经有十分之一的摩洛哥人民为了反抗法国的殖民统治献出了他们的生命。第二次世界大战期间和战后，由于亚洲和非洲的许多国家的人民纷纷挣脱了殖民者加在他们头上的枷锁，取得了民族独立和自由，宣告了腐朽的殖民主义制度注定垮台的命运，摩洛哥人民觉悟就更加提高了，而且因为工人阶级的力量的日益增长，摩洛哥的民族解放运动就进入了新的阶段。摩洛哥人民在摩洛哥共产党领导下，提出了要求废除一九一二年签订的非斯条约、取消“保护国”制度的口号，并为这一目标而展开不屈不挠的斗争。摩洛哥人民争取民族独立和自由的愿望是合法合理的，但是法国统治集团却死不肯放弃在摩洛哥和北非其他地区的殖民利益，以加强残酷镇压和法西斯恐怖统治来回答摩洛哥人民的民族独立的要求。同时，法国当局又提出了所谓“改革政策”，企图分化摩洛哥民族解放运动，巩固它的殖民统治，但是这一切都没有能使摩洛哥人民屈服和受骗。在民族运动不断增长的情况下，摩洛哥前任苏丹优素福也要求法国政府重新审查保护条约，并拒绝在法国当局提出的“改革”草案上签字。法国当局恼羞成怒竟于一九五三年八月策动武装政变，非法废黜了摩洛哥苏丹优素福，扶植彻头彻尾的傀儡阿拉法为苏丹。随之而来的是对摩洛哥人民加紧镇压和迫害。法国殖民当局的这种专横和毒辣手段，只使得摩洛哥人民更勇猛地展开反抗的斗争。两年以来，摩洛哥各地的爱国者不断地举行示威、罢工、罢市，来表示他们争取自由的意志。而法国当局仍然企图依靠暴力压服摩洛哥人民的民族解放斗争，变本加厉地进行野蛮屠杀，流血事件几乎天天发生，因而使摩洛哥的局势日益紧张起来。
    在这期间，摩洛哥共产党不止一次提出过主张：法国当局应停止对摩洛哥的镇压措施，在承认摩洛哥国家主权和民族独立基础上同摩洛哥人民的真正代表进行谈判；并指出：必须首先停止和殖民主义者扶植的分子进行阴谋活动，废除一九五三年八月强迫苏丹优素福签订的关于政治和行政“改革”的议定书，废除和摩洛哥主权完全相违反的所谓“改革”，并在谈判以前解决苏丹王位问题。但是法国当局对这种正当的呼声置若罔闻，而继续执行暴力政策，并且在苏丹优素福被迫退位两周年的日子，对摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚人民进行了大规模的血腥屠杀。这就完全暴露出了法国殖民者野蛮和凶恶的面目，使人不能不怀疑法国当局近来表示愿意通过谈判解决摩洛哥问题的姿态究竟有几分诚意。
    事实上，法国政府最近所拟订的所谓解决摩洛哥问题的方案，就不是真正想解决问题的办法。法国当局明明知道靠了法国刺刀保护而在位的苏丹阿拉法，是摩洛哥人民所唾弃的傀儡，却偏偏不肯考虑摩洛哥人民要求苏丹优素福复位的愿望，而让阿拉法去搞一套所谓改组政府的把戏。前法国总理皮杜尔甚至公然叫嚣不许碰阿拉法的一根毫毛。试问这怎能使人相信法国政府确实愿意同摩洛哥人民的真正代表进行诚恳的谈判呢？
    全世界进步人类都是同情和支持摩洛哥人民争取民族独立的斗争的，各国舆论无数次斥责法国殖民者在摩洛哥的镇压政策。阿拉伯国家曾一再向联合国大会控诉法国在摩洛哥的罪恶行为。最近，十六个亚非国家又联合致函联合国安全理事会，要求它运用它的力量来处理摩洛哥局势；指出法国在摩洛哥采取严厉镇压措施和恐怖行动而造成的局势，必然引起整个亚非两洲极其严重的反响，并且使国际紧张局势加剧和危害国际和平与安全。法国殖民者八月二十日以来的大屠杀，自然要激起各国人民更大的愤慨。屠杀摩洛哥人民的刽子手是无法逃避世界舆论的谴责的。
    法国殖民者应该懂得，任何恐怖镇压手段，都绝不能摧毁和动摇殖民地人民争取民族独立的意志的。法国当局必须立即停止对摩洛哥人民的镇压，通过真正的谈判来谋求摩洛哥问题的合理解决。在这里，有必要提一下法共总书记莫理斯·多列士说过的一句话：“法国是可以做正处于民族被压迫的锁链中的各民族的朋友和盟邦的，唯一的条件就是承认它们的完全独立。”
