    Advancing on the Road of Industrialized Construction
    ——A Journey to the Urals, Part Six
    By Li He, Our Correspondent in Moscow

    I.
    It was a Sunday morning. The sun had just climbed over the horizon and hadn't yet driven away the chill of the night. Many people in Sverdlovsk, having worked a week, were still sound asleep, and the city was quiet. At this moment, groups of members of the Lenin Communist Youth League were setting off for the suburbs. They passed the "Stone Curtain" made of natural rocks, recalling the story of Sverdlov leading other revolutionary workers to hold meetings here during the Tsarist Russian era. They crossed the forest covered with white frost, heading towards the beautiful Shartash Lake, singing joyful songs in chorus. The loud singing startled the birds in the forest, breaking the tranquility of the early morning.
    A group of female students from the Teachers College walked along. One of them loudly recited Mayakovsky's poems:
    "I know cities will appear,
    I know gardens will bloom,
    When the Soviet state has such people."
    Were the Youth League members going on a holiday outing? No. They were going to become "such people" – the builders of the city. Inheriting the tradition of "obligatory Saturdays," they used the labor of "obligatory Sundays" to help the state build a prefabricated reinforced concrete component factory. The students of the Sverdlovsk Institute of Technology participated in the previous "obligatory Sunday," and the students of the Mining Institute and Teachers College participated in this one. I followed the footsteps of the Youth League members to the construction site.

    At the construction site next to the forest, the framework of the factory building had already been erected in the front part, and the foundation was still being laid in the rear part. From afar, one could see the towering hoppers of the future mixed concrete workshop. The regular construction workers were off today. Groups of volunteer construction workers were active on the construction site. The female students who participated in the labor all wore flexible sportswear. Some of the Youth League members were digging deep foundations and clearing stones from the foundations, some were laying bricks, and some were removing unnecessary debris from the construction site.
    Under the framework of the factory building, a group of students were pulling a steel rail that was in the way. The steel rail seemed heavy, and they couldn't move it with one or two pulls. Later, they pulled it to the side of the road in rhythm, with shouts of "Heave-ho!" Another group of students were moving some smaller pieces of iron. Sharechev, the Youth League branch committee member of the Geological Exploration Department of the Mining Institute, was handing the iron pieces to the second person.
    "Hello! Is the work interesting?" I asked them. Sharechev replied, "Eight hundred people from our institute came today. Each of us wants to build the factory faster so that more new houses will appear in Sverdlovsk and nearby areas. The components produced by this factory in the future will be enough to build 300,000 square meters of houses every year."
    Opposite Sharechev's group, a dozen female students from the Mining Institute formed a living "conveyor belt." The bricks were transported through this "conveyor belt" to the half-finished wall of the future workshop. They sang songs in rhythm while carrying out the "assembly line" operation. The bricks were neatly stacked up. Tomorrow, the bricklayers can save a lot of time.
    Among these male and female students, I met male and female international students from our country. They are studying at the Mining Institute and volunteered to learn the spirit of labor of Soviet youth here. About twenty of them came today. Last Sunday, the international students from our country studying at the Institute of Technology also came.
    I walked to a row of five foundation pits as large as round tables. In each foundation pit, six male and female students were swinging their pickaxes, talking and laughing. They jumped out of the foundation pit to chat with me for a few words, and then quickly jumped back to work. Another foundation pit was full of stones, making the students sweat profusely. But they still dug down diligently, and the stones had to give way to them.
    Female students from the Teachers College were transporting garbage and leveling the site in the future factory workers' residential area. Thirteen two-story houses have already been built here, and thousands of Youth League members in Sverdlovsk – college students, workers, and staff – participated in their construction. Fedotova, who recited Mayakovsky's poems on the way here in the morning, was also transporting garbage here.
    "How do you feel about your work?" I asked this fair-haired girl. The future teacher stared intently with her blue eyes and said thoughtfully, "Obligatory Sundays develop the feeling of collectivism. Obligatory Sundays cultivate the spirit of love for labor. We all strive to complete our work before getting off work. Six thousand young people in Sverdlovsk applied to participate in reclaiming wasteland, but only five hundred were approved. We need to finish the academic year. We also hope to invest our small share of labor into the great torrent of labor of the people of the whole country. So we decided to come here to work."
    After the "obligatory Sunday," the work on the construction site was carried out by eight hundred regular construction workers. They are also Youth League members from various enterprises in response to the call of the Party. In order to realize the ideals of the Youth League members, many people did not hesitate to leave their original jobs with higher wages and more familiar work to come here to do more difficult work. They are engaged in a socialist competition with the young workers who built the Stalingrad prefabricated reinforced concrete component factory. They are accelerating the speed month by month: completing 122 percent of the plan in January, 137 percent in February, 172 percent in March... A factory is growing upward from the ground day by day at this speed, like a plant. One of the factories in this largest prefabricated reinforced concrete component manufacturing plant in the Urals will be completed one year ahead of schedule in December this year. It will produce 120,000 cubic meters of prefabricated reinforced concrete components and 30,000 cubic meters of concrete slurry every year.

    II.
    The Sverdlovsk prefabricated reinforced concrete component factory is just one of such factories in the Urals that are under construction. In the suburbs of Chelyabinsk, I also saw a similarly large-scale factory with the framework of the factory building already built. It was also built by the Youth League members of this city.
    In the residential area of Magnitogorsk, I saw the first houses in the entire Soviet Union assembled without skeletons from large reinforced concrete wall panels, and the workshops and factories that manufacture these components. Comrade Marktumin, director of the Large Wall Panel Department of the Magnitogorsk Construction Bureau, took me on a tour. This small technical science master is an activist fighting to realize industrialized construction methods. He initially came to Magnitogorsk to prepare his master's thesis, but was attracted by the actual design work of the city and bravely put aside the matter of writing his master's thesis for several years. He was one of the builders of the first house assembled without skeletons from large reinforced concrete wall panels. He believes that for buildings with reinforced concrete components of five stories or less, frameless is more convenient and promising than with frames.
    Six four-story houses built with frameless large wall panels are arranged among the beautiful and neat buildings in the residential area of steel workers on the right bank of the Ural River. Magnitogorsk is building 100,000 square meters of housing every year. Only with this industrialized construction method can we keep up with the needs of objective development. Each room in these houses made of reinforced concrete components is assembled with four large wall panels and one roof panel. A three-ton crane is used to assemble them layer by layer from bottom to top. Therefore, when the second floor is being assembled, the first floor can be floored and decorated. The assembly team has nine people, working in two shifts. Each wall panel takes an average of twelve to eighteen minutes to assemble, including six to twelve minutes for placement and correction. The first house with twenty-four suites took six months to assemble due to lack of experience; the second and third houses with twenty-six suites took only twenty-eight and a half days and twenty-eight days; the fourth and fifth houses with thirty-two suites took thirty-six days; the sixth house with forty suites took forty days. The components of frameless large wall panel houses are simple, so the assembly time is so short. Engineer Marktumin cited a clear contrast: "The labor volume for building brick houses is 1.4 to 1.5 workdays per cubic meter, the labor volume for building component houses with frames is 1.2 workdays per cubic meter, and the labor volume for frameless component houses is 0.25 to 0.32 workdays per cubic meter."
    In the past few years, the components were manufactured on the formwork of the workshop. The workshop is very simple. A row of formwork like large door panels lay on the open ground. Steel bars are installed in these formwork nailed from templates, concrete slurry is poured, and steam is passed through, and after a certain period of time, it condenses into a large wall panel, and then the formwork is removed. Using this simple method, a worker manufactures an average of 0.7 cubic meters of components per shift.
    From the winter of 1954, the construction of a factory for large wall panels for building houses began in Magnitogorsk. It can be put into operation in 1955. Engineer Marktumin said: "Its production capacity is not as good as the Sverdlovsk factory, but the components produced every year are enough to assemble more than 30,000 square meters of housing." The residential construction in Magnitogorsk on the right bank of the Ural River will therefore develop more rapidly.

    III.
    People in Magnitogorsk in southeastern Urals use steel slag discarded by local steel factories to manufacture steel slag concrete components. People in Berezhniki in northwestern Urals use sand and cement or sand and lime to manufacture light, heat-resistant and sound-insulating porous concrete components. In Berezhniki, I arrived at the first factory in the entire Soviet Union to manufacture porous concrete components and the houses experimentally built with these components.
    At the end of 1954, the staff of the North Ural Construction Bureau and the Central Scientific Research Institute of Industrial Equipment experimentally built a three-story house with large porous concrete wall panels in Berezhniki. Experience has proved that building with this porous large wall panel is not only possible but also economical. Therefore, a new factory was built next to the workshop that originally manufactured experimental houses. Except for the machines, everything in this factory was created by the labor of young people. Some of them learned operating skills and became workers in the factory.
    There are not many workers, basically female workers. Because the production process of the factory is completely mechanized. The elevator transports the sand in the warehouse to the hopper of the rotating dryer at high altitude. The dried sand falls to the grinder below to be crushed. Sand, water, and cement are all metered, and the foaming agent is also stirred with water in the rotating foamer. Then the slurry and foam are mixed in a rotating mixer and poured into a large mold frame like a door panel. Steel bars and heating pipes are pre-placed in the large mold frame. The mold frame stops on the rails connected to the autoclave. After a certain period of time, it is pushed into the autoclave like a large boiler. In steam at a temperature of 174 degrees Celsius and a pressure of eight atmospheres, the foamed slurry in the mold frame becomes a porous concrete wall panel.
    This factory can produce 30,000 cubic meters of components a year. The components produced by such a factory with five autoclaves can replace 25 million to 30 million bricks, and building with these components saves more than half the cost compared to building with these bricks. The factory not only manufactures components for residential buildings, but also manufactures extremely strong components for industrial construction.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union decided to establish 402 factories and 200 workshops manufacturing reinforced concrete components within two years. In the Urals and throughout the Soviet Union, this decision is being successfully implemented. The Soviet Union is rapidly advancing on the road of industrialized construction.

    在工业化建筑的道路上前进
    ——乌拉尔纪行之六
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    一
    是一个星期日的早晨。太阳才爬上地平线，还没有赶走夜间留下的寒意。斯维德洛夫斯克劳动了一周的人们，有许多还在甜睡，市面静悄悄的。这时，一群又一群列宁共产主义青年团团员向市郊出发了。他们走过了天然岩石构成的“石幕”，回忆起在沙皇俄国时代斯维尔德洛夫带领其他革命工作者在这里开会的故事。他们穿越过撒满白霜的森林，走向美丽的沙尔塔什湖，合唱着快乐的歌曲。嘹亮的歌声惊起了林间的小鸟，打破了清晨的静寂。
    一群教育学院的女学生走着。她们当中有谁高声背诵马雅可夫斯基的诗句：
    “我知道城市会出现，
    我知道园圃会开花，
    当苏维埃国家有这样的人们。”
    青年团员们去作假日郊游吗？不是的。他们是去做“这样的人们”——城市的建设者。他们继承着“义务星期六”的传统，用“义务星期天”的劳动，帮助国家建筑钢筋混凝土构件制造厂。参加上一个“义务星期天”的是斯维德洛夫斯克工学院的学生，参加这一个“义务星期天”的是矿业学院和教育学院的学生。我追随青年团员们的脚迹到了工地。
    在森林旁边的工地上，前面部分已经建立起厂房的骨架，后面部分继续打着地基。老远可以看见未来的混合混凝土的车间的耸立的大料斗。正式的建筑工人今天休息去了。工地上东一群西一组的义务建筑工人在活动着。参加劳动的女学生们都穿着一身灵活的运动衣裤。青年团员们有些在掘深基坑和清除基坑里的石头，有些在砌砖，有些在搬开工地上多余的杂物。
    在厂房的骨架下，一群学生在拉动一根碍路的钢轨。钢轨似乎很重，他们一下、两下拉不动，后来合着拍子，嗬嗬嗨地把钢轨拉到路边去了。另一群学生在搬开一些较小的铁块。矿业学院地质勘探系的团支部委员沙雷切夫正把铁块递给第二个人。
    “你好！工作满有意思吧。”我向他们问讯了。沙雷切夫回答：“我们学院今天来了八百个人。我们每个人都想把工厂更快地建立起来，使得在斯维德洛夫斯克和附近各地出现更多的新房屋。这个工厂将来每年出产的构件，足够建造三十万平方公尺房屋。”
    在沙雷切夫组的对面，十来个矿业学院的女学生组成了活的“输送带”。砖块经过这个“输送带”运到未来的车间的半截墙边。她们一边进行“流水作业”，一边有节奏地合唱着歌曲。砖块整齐地累叠起来。明天，砌砖工人可以节省许多时间。
    在这些男女学生中，我遇见了我国的男女留学生。他们在矿业学院学习，自愿来这里学习苏联青年的劳动精神。他们今天来了约二十个人。上一个星期天，在工学院学习的我国留学生也来过。
    我走到一排五个圆桌大的基坑面前。每个基坑有六个男女学生有说有笑地挥动着铁镐。他们跳出基坑来和我交谈几句，又赶紧跳回原地去工作。另外一处基坑里尽是石头，把学生们弄得满头大汗。但是他们还是认真地掘下去，石头只好向他们让步了。
    教育学院的女学生们正在未来的工厂工人住宅区搬运垃圾和填平地段。这里已盖好十三座两层楼房屋，斯维德洛夫斯克的几千青年团员——大学生、工人、职员——参加了它们的建筑。早晨在来路上朗诵马雅可夫斯基诗句的费多托娃也在这里搬运垃圾。
    “你们对于自己的工作感觉怎样？”我问这位浅黄头发的姑娘。这位未来的教员凝定蓝眼睛，若有所思地说：“义务星期天发展着集体主义的感觉。义务星期天培育着爱劳动的精神。我们全都努力在下班前完成工作。斯维德洛夫斯克有六千青年申请参加开垦荒地，只有五百人得到批准。我们需要读完学年。我们也希望把自己的小股劳动投进全国人民的劳动巨流中去。所以我们决定了来这里工作。”
    过了“义务星期天”，工地上的工作由八百个经常的建筑工人进行。他们也是响应党的号召从各个企业来的青年团员。许多人为了实现团员的理想，不惜离开原来工资更高的、工作较熟悉的岗位来这里干条件比较困难的工作。他们和建筑斯大林格勒钢筋混凝土构件制造厂的青年工人们进行着社会主义竞赛。他们一月月地加快速度：一月份完成计划百分之一百二十二，二月份—一百三十七，三月份—一百七十二……。一座工厂凭着这个速度好像植物从平地一天天地向上成长着。这个乌拉尔最大的钢筋混凝土构件制造厂中的一个工厂将提前一年在今年十二月完工。它每年将出产十二万立方公尺钢筋混凝土构件和三万立方公尺混凝土浆。
    二
    斯维德洛夫斯克钢筋混凝土构件制造厂只是乌拉尔在建筑中的这类工厂之一。在车里雅宾斯克的市郊，我也见到已经建好厂房骨架的同样大规模的工厂。它也是由这个市的青年团员建筑的。
    在马格尼托高尔斯克的住宅区，我见到全苏联最先用钢筋混凝土的大墙板无骨架地装配起来的房屋和制造这些构件的工场和工厂。带我参观的是马格尼托高尔斯克建筑局大墙板部主任马克土明同志。这位小个子的技术科学硕士，是为实现工业化建筑方法而斗争的积极分子。他最初来到马格尼托高尔斯克准备硕士论文，可是被城市的实际设计工作所吸引，把写硕士论文的事勇敢地丢开了几年。他是第一座用钢筋混凝土的大墙板无骨架地装配起来的房屋的建筑者之一。他认为：在建筑五层楼以下的钢筋混凝土构件的房屋，无骨架是比有骨架更方便更有前途的。
    六座四层楼用大墙板无骨架地盖成的房屋，排列在乌拉尔河右岸钢铁工人住宅区的漂亮而整齐的建筑物当中。马格尼托高尔斯克每年建筑着十万平方公尺住宅。只有用这种工业化建筑方法，才能赶得上客观发展的需要。这些由钢筋混凝土构件构成的房屋的每个房间，是用四大块墙板和一块顶板装配的。用三吨重的起重机从下而上一层层装配。所以在装配第二层的时候，第一层就可以铺地板和修饰了。装配组九个人，分两班工作。每块墙板平均装配十二到十八分钟，包括安置和校正的六分钟到十二分钟。第一座二十四套间的房屋因为经验不足，装配了六个月；第二、第三座二十六套间的房屋只装配了二十八天半和二十八天；第四、第五座三十二套间的房屋—三十六天；第六座四十套间的房屋—四十天。无骨架的大墙板的房屋构件简单，所以装配的时间这样短。马克土明工程师举出了鲜明的对比：“建筑砖房的劳动量每一立方公尺为一点四—一点五工作日，建筑有骨架的构件房屋每立方公尺为一点二工作日，无骨架的构件房屋每立方公尺为零点二五—零点三二工作日。”
    在这几年来，构件是在工场的模架上制造的。工场非常简单。在室外空地上躺着一排大门板似的模架。在这些模板钉成的模架里装上钢筋，灌上混凝土浆，通上蒸汽，过一定时期便凝成大墙板，然后拆开模架取出。用这个简便方法，一个工人一班平均制造零点七立方公尺构件。
    从一九五四年冬季起，在马格尼托高尔斯克开始建筑盖房屋用的大墙板的工厂。一九五五年可以开工。马克土明工程师说：“它的生产能力比不上斯维德洛夫斯克工厂，但是每年生产的构件足够装配三万平方公尺以上住宅。”马格尼托高尔斯克在乌拉尔河右岸的住宅建筑因此将更加迅速地发展起来。
    三
    在乌拉尔东南的马格尼托高尔斯克的人们，利用当地钢铁工厂废弃的钢渣制造钢渣混凝土构件。在乌拉尔西北的别列兹尼奇的人们，利用沙和水泥或沙和石灰制造又轻又耐热隔音的多孔混凝土构件。在别列兹尼奇，我到了全苏联第一座制造多孔混凝土构件的工厂和用这种构件试建的房屋。
    北乌拉尔建筑局和工业设备中央科学研究院的工作人员，一九五四年年底在别列兹尼奇用多孔混凝土的大墙板试建了一座三层楼房屋。经验证明，用这种多孔大墙板建筑不但可能而且经济。因此在原来制造试验性房屋的车间旁边建立了新的工厂。这个工厂除了机器以外，一切都是由青年们的劳动创造的。其中有些人学习了操作技术，成为工厂的工人。
    工人不多，基本是女工。因为工厂的生产过程全部是机械化的。升降机把仓库里的沙运到高处旋转的烘干器的料斗中。烘干了的沙落到下面研磨机上研碎。沙、水、水泥都经过计量器，同时起沫剂加水也在旋转的起沫器内搅拌。然后泥浆和泡沫在转旋的混合器内混和，再倒进门板似的大模框中。在大模框中预先放好钢筋和暖气管。模框停在通到压热器的铁轨上。过了一定时间，它便被推进大锅炉似的压热器中。在摄氏一百七十四度热度和八个大气压力的蒸汽中，模框内的泡沫泥浆便变成多孔的混凝土墙板。
    这个工厂一年能出产三万立方公尺的构件。具有五台压热器的这类工厂一年所产的构件，能够代替二千五百万到三千万块砖，用这些构件比用这些砖建筑节约费用一半以上。工厂不但制造住宅用的构件，也制造工业建设用的极牢固的构件。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议决定在两年内建立制造钢筋混凝土的构件的工厂四百零二座和工场二百座。在乌拉尔和全苏联各地，这个决定在顺利地实现着。苏联在工业化建筑的道路上迅速地前进着。
