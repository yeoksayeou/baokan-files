　　Improve Canned Food Production and Expand Exports
　　Yu Ping, Deputy Manager of China National Food Export Corporation
　　In recent years, the export volume of canned food in our country has been increasing year by year. The total export volume in 1954 was about ten times that of 1950. The year 1955 will see a large increase compared to 1954. Before 1953, there were only more than ten varieties of canned fruits and vegetables for export. In 1954, the number of canned meats, fish, and poultry increased to more than thirty. Thanks to gradual improvements in management and the assistance of fraternal countries, the quality and specifications of canned food have also been greatly improved. Before 1953, the main export regions were only the Soviet Union and Hong Kong. In 1954, the export scope was greatly expanded with the addition of the Czechoslovak Republic, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, and Southeast Asian countries.

　　At present, the potential of canned food production in our country is still very large. According to estimates by the industrial sector, the thirteen canneries that have the conditions to produce canned food for export have a maximum production capacity that is more than twice the current output. At the same time, the raw materials needed for canned food production are also abundant. Our country produces many varieties of fruits, and the output has been increasing rapidly year after year. For example, bananas, pineapples, oranges, lychees, and loquats are produced in the south; apples, apricots, peaches, pears and other fruits in the north are of good quality and taste. If fresh fruits are exported, transportation and storage are subject to certain restrictions, while processing them into canned food for export is very popular abroad. In particular, canned oranges have been well received abroad due to continuous improvements in quality and specifications. Our country's coastal aquatic products are also very rich and can be used to make a large number of canned fish and shrimp. Various vegetables are even inexhaustible.

　　Most of these raw materials for producing canned food are not the staple foods necessary for people's daily lives. Organizing the export of canned food can be exchanged for materials needed domestically. For example, the canned food exported in 1954 could be exchanged for a complete set of machinery and equipment for a seamless steel pipe plant, or two large textile factories with 50,000 spindles, which plays a certain role in expanding foreign exchange earnings and accelerating our country's socialist industrialization.

　　In recent years, canned food from our country has established a certain reputation in the international market. The Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democracies are very interested in our canned food. In 1954, Czechoslovakia sent a telegram expressing their satisfaction with our canned food. Canned pineapples and oranges exported to the United Kingdom have also received good feedback. In order to consolidate the existing reputation and expand overseas sales markets, we require the canned food production departments to do the following tasks well and work harder to improve quality.

　　First, carefully study product ingredient methods to suit the tastes of foreign consumers. The canned food produced in our country for export is mostly formulated according to the tastes of domestic people, which is often not suitable for the needs of foreign consumers. At the same time, the requirements of different countries are also inconsistent. For example, for the braised pork canned food produced in our country, the Soviet Union requires reducing the sweetness and adding bay leaves and other ingredients; while the Southeast Asian market prefers braised pork with curry and spicy and sweet ketchup. For example, the Soviet Union and Eastern European New Democratic countries prefer sugar juice fruits with higher sugar content, while the United Kingdom requires lower sugar content. Therefore, carefully studying and mastering the different taste characteristics of foreign consumers for processing and formulation is undoubtedly an important condition for expanding the foreign market for canned food.

　　Second, select high-quality raw materials to improve product quality. Before processing, the raw materials must be strictly selected. In addition to meeting the processing specifications, meat raw materials need to be inspected by health and quarantine authorities before they can be processed. For canned fruits, it is not only required to select undamaged by agricultural pests, moderately ripe, fresh and intact fruits, but also require uniform size, shape, and color in terms of appearance. Some countries have proposed that orange segments should be canned according to large, medium, and small shapes. The Myanmar purchasing delegation reflected that the disadvantage of our canned grapes is that the particles are uneven in size. We must pay attention to correcting these shortcomings in the future to ensure excellent quality and facilitate sales.

　　Third, improve the operation process and pay attention to factory environmental hygiene. This is a key issue that determines the quality of canned food after the raw materials are prepared. The development level of domestic canneries is inconsistent, and the technical capabilities and equipment conditions sometimes cannot keep up with the requirements of foreign sales, especially the production in complete accordance with foreign specifications and technical conditions, there are still some difficulties; but efforts should be made to improve. To this end, canneries should exchange technical experience more, learn from each other; at the same time, they should strive for more assistance and guidance from experts in fraternal countries.

　　Fourth, improve packaging and appearance trademark patterns. Although the packaging of canned food in our country has improved year by year, it still cannot meet foreign requirements. For example, there are not many can styles, the opening method of glass bottles is not convenient enough, and the decoration trademarks are not beautiful enough, all of which need to be improved. In particular, for exports to the markets of capitalist countries, more attention should be paid to the beautiful decoration of commodities. At the same time, the industrial sector is also required to solve the problem of tinplate can inner wall coating as soon as possible. Attention should also be paid to improving the degree of vacuum inside the can to avoid spoilage. Only in this way can the quality of the food in the can be fundamentally guaranteed and the storage time extended.

　　In addition, the cost of canned food in our country is still relatively high. The cost of canned food after processing is generally one to several times higher than the price of raw materials, which also causes certain difficulties in the sales of canned food in foreign markets. This requires all canned food factories to improve their management, strengthen economic accounting, and save raw material consumption, to achieve the goal of reducing costs and create more conditions for expanding foreign sales.

### 改进罐头食品的生产，扩大出口

　　改进罐头食品的生产，扩大出口
　　中国食品出口公司副经理　余萍
    几年来，我国罐头食品的出口数量逐年增加。一九五四年出口的总量，约等于一九五○年的十倍。一九五五年比一九五四年又要大大增加。一九五三年以前出口的品种只有水果和蔬菜罐头十多种。一九五四年便增加了肉类、鱼、家禽等罐头达三十多种。由于经营管理逐渐改进和兄弟国家的帮助，罐头食品的品质规格也大大提高。一九五三年以前，主要出口地区只有苏联和香港，一九五四年增加了捷克斯洛伐克共和国、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、英国及东南亚等国家，出口范围也大大扩大了。
    目前我国罐头生产方面的潜力还很大。据工业部门估计，具备生产出口罐头食品条件的十三个罐头厂，最高生产能力约比目前产量大一倍以上。同时，罐头生产所需的原料也很丰富。我国出产的水果品种很多，产量连年激增。如南方生产的香蕉、菠萝、桔柑、荔枝、枇杷；北方的苹果、杏、桃、梨等水果，质量和味道都很好。如果鲜果出口，运输和保管等都受到一定限制，而加工成罐头出口，很受国外欢迎。尤其是桔子罐头，由于品质规格不断改善，颇得国外好评。我国沿海水产也很丰富，可制大量的鱼虾罐头。各种蔬菜更是取之不尽。
    这些生产罐头的原料，大部分不是人民日常生活必需的主食。能组织罐头输出，就可换进国内需要的物资。如一九五四年出口的罐头可换回一个无缝钢管厂的全套机器设备，或两个五万纱锭的大纺织厂，对扩大外汇收入以加速我国社会主义工业化，起着一定的作用。
    几年来，我国罐头在国际市场曾树立了一定的信誉。苏联和东欧人民民主国家对我国的罐头都很感兴趣。一九五四年捷克斯洛伐克来电报表示，对我国罐头很满意。出口到英国的菠萝、桔柑罐头，也曾得到良好的反映。为巩固已有的信誉和扩大国外销售市场，我们要求罐头生产部门做好下列几项工作，要更加努力提高质量。
    第一、很好地研究产品配料方法，以适合国外消费者的口味。我国生产的出口罐头食品多按照国内人民的口味来配制，往往不适合国外消费者的需求。同时，各国的要求也不一致。如我国生产的红烧猪肉罐头，苏联要求减轻甜味另加月桂叶等配料；而东南亚市场便喜爱有加厘辣味和带甜茄汁的红烧扣肉罐头。又如苏联和东欧新民主国家喜欢糖汁水果含糖量较高些，英国便要求较低些。因此，仔细地研究、掌握国外消费者的不同口味特点来进行加工配制，无疑的是扩大罐头对外市场的重要条件。
    第二、精选优良原料，提高产品质量。加工以前，对原料要进行严密的选择。肉食类原料除符合加工的规格外，还需要经过卫生检疫机关检验才能加工。对水果罐头，不仅要求选用不受农业虫害损伤，成熟适度，新鲜完好的果实，并且在外形方面还要求大小形状及色泽均匀。有的国家已提出桔子瓣要按大、中、小形状分别装罐，缅甸采购团反映我们的葡萄罐头的缺点是颗粒大小不一。我们今后必须注意改正这些缺点，保证优良的品质，以利销售。
    第三、改进操作过程，注意工厂环境卫生。这是在原料备妥后，决定罐头品质好坏的关键问题。国内各罐头厂发展水平不一致，技术能力和设备条件有时还赶不上外销的要求，特别是完全按照国外规格技术条件生产，还有一些困难；但应努力改进。为此，各罐头厂应该更多地交流技术经验，互相观摩学习；同时要更多地争取兄弟国家专家的帮助和指导。
    第四、改善包装和外形商标图案。我国罐头包装虽逐年有所改进，但还不能满足国外要求。如罐型式样不多，玻璃瓶开罐方法不够便利，装璜商标不够美观等，都需要注意改进。特别对资本主义国家的市场出口，更要注意商品装璜美观。同时也要求工业部门早日解决马口铁罐内壁涂料问题。对罐头内真空度数也应注意提高，免致腐烂。这样才能从根本上保证罐内食品质量，延长保存时间。
    此外，我国罐头的成本还较高，加工后的罐头成本，一般高出原料价格一倍以至数倍，因而也造成罐头在国外市场销售上的某些困难。这就要求各罐头工厂改进经营管理，加强经济核算，节省原材料消耗，以达到降低成本目的，为扩大外销创造更多条件。
