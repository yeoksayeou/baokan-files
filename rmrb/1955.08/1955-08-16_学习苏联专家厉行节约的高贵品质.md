    Learning from Soviet Experts' Noble Qualities of Practicing Thrift
    Li Wen, He Ling

    Batches of agricultural machines donated by the Soviet Union were shipped to the State-Run Friendship Farm. Fulitun (the temporary location of the farm's preparatory office) became busy. In the frigid season of minus ten to thirty degrees Celsius, tractor drivers and implement operators were busy receiving the machines and transporting them to various branch fields in a timely manner, installing various implements such as plows, seeders, and disc harrows at any time, actively preparing for spring sowing and land reclamation. Comrade Nikolenko, the farm's chief consultant, often went to the machine storage yard to personally inspect and guide the machine installation work. Seeing grass sacks scattered on the ground, he suggested to the farm director to collect these grass sacks and put them in a designated place to avoid waste and loss, and for convenient use when needed. He picked up randomly discarded iron nails at any time and suggested to relevant comrades to clean up these iron nails. At first, the comrades did not understand the significance of this suggestion. He patiently explained to everyone: "Our farm has many rubber-wheeled vehicles and cars, brand-new machines, and these things are a great threat to them. It is so distressing when new cars and new machines that have not been used are punctured!"

    Comrade Nikolenko cared about the country's property at all times and in all places. Even very small things were noticed by him. Once he was taking a walk and accidentally saw that the wooden shed for packing "Victory" brand cars was damaged during unloading. At a cadre meeting held that evening, he solemnly brought it up: "Something unpleasant happened today. When we were unloading small cars, we carelessly damaged the wooden shed that was used to pack the cars..." He paused here, and a few more traces of seriousness were added to his kind and elderly face. "Comrades should understand that we will not be able to build car garages all at once. Cars rely on these wooden sheds to protect them from wind, snow, and mud. This is one aspect; on the other hand, our farm has just begun to be established, and we don't have anything yet. Everything has to be paid for by the state. A piece of wood, a grass sack, and an iron crowbar will all have their uses in the farm's future production and construction. We shouldn't damage ready-made objects even more. We must educate the workers so that they can think of a large machine or a small thing and say: 'This is state property, we must cherish it and give play to its role.' And gradually develop such a good habit."

    During the days of intense implement installation, according to the suggestions of Soviet experts, the general headquarters held a short meeting every night, where the deputy director and other responsible persons reported on the work of the day and plans for the next day. Comrade Nikolenko always attended in person.

    "The third branch field lost some installation tools. Without these, it will affect the progress of the installation work, and they are requesting a replacement..." At a meeting, the deputy chief engineer of the machinery department reported.

    Comrade Nikolenko was obviously uneasy. He was writing something urgently in his notebook, frowning, and listening very attentively, as if afraid of missing a single word translated.

    "We must not allow this phenomenon to continue. Absolutely not. This is a phenomenon of no one being responsible for state property. It is the result of our failure to properly implement the responsibility system when we handed these tools over to the workers." The old expert Nikolenko, who was sincerely saddened by the bad phenomenon of easily losing tools, spoke up. He continued, "In the Soviet Union, if a tractor driver casually loses the tools on his machine, he has to compensate for it himself, and it is implemented as a system. Every agricultural machine and tool must have someone responsible for its use and safekeeping, and the chief mechanical engineer must be responsible to the farm director and take effective measures to ensure that these machines, implements, and tools do not suffer undue damage or loss. I suggest: we should warn them about this irresponsible attitude towards state property, and make everyone understand that state property is sacred and inviolable, and no one has the right to damage it or throw it away at will. Otherwise, even if we issue more tools, there will still be a shortage of tools, and the machine installation work will still not be guaranteed."

    Comrade Nikolenko not only repeatedly talked about the importance of cherishing state property at cadre meetings and put forward various suggestions; he also often went deep into the field and waged sharp struggles against phenomena of indifference towards state and public property at any time.

    Once, Comrade Nikolenko arrived at the headquarters of the Fifth Branch Field and was walking when he saw several dark objects in the snow ahead. Suddenly, the old expert bent down, brushed away the snow with his bare hands, and took out the objects. It turned out to be furnace rings for stoves. The old expert asked someone to find the branch field administrator and said to him, "These furnace rings are very thin. If they are thrown randomly on the snow, they will easily be trampled on and broken. When you need to use them, you will have to re-equip them. Have you ever thought that this will cost the country another expense!"

    At this time, near the implement storage yard, an installation platform was lying irregularly on the snow. The installation platform was a piece of very flat, high-quality wood, wrapped in iron sheet, and used to adjust the level when adjusting plows, seeders, and other implements. Several people carelessly walked over the installation platform. Comrade Nikolenko saw it and quickly told everyone: the installation platform cannot be thrown around like this. The ground is not flat enough, and if people step on it, the installation platform will lose its effectiveness in adjusting the level. That day, he severely criticized the deputy director of the Fifth Branch Field and told him that he should use these concrete facts to raise the awareness of workers and their concept of cherishing state property.

    Land reclamation work entered a climax. Comrade Nikolenko went to the fields more often to inspect the work. He not only cared about the normal progress of land reclamation and put forward various suggestions in a timely manner; he also cared very much about the cost of land reclamation. He repeatedly emphasized: "If our land reclamation is fast and of good quality, but the cost is also very high, then our work is not done well, and we have not fulfilled our responsibilities to the country well." He emphasized saving fuel and valuing the maintenance and care of tractors and implements. When he went to the production team to inspect the work, he saw that the production team's agricultural machinery was well maintained, and the implements that were not in use were placed in an orderly manner and kept clean. A heartfelt joy immediately flowed from his smiling face. At this time, he always happily told people again and again: "It would be great if every production team could be like this. The machines are used by someone, and someone cares for and cherishes them. Only then can they play a highly effective role!" When he saw agricultural machinery and parts placed randomly at the work site, or someone indifferently wasting state property, his emotional reaction was particularly sensitive, and he felt so sorry for it!

    One evening, near the oil depot of the Sixth Production Team's field work site, six tractors gathered. The tractor drivers of the day shift and night shift were changing shifts. Some were checking the machine screws, and some were refueling. The night shift work was about to begin soon. Comrade Nikolenko and Farm Director Wang were sitting on the girder of a flame extinguisher near the oil depot, inspecting the handover. On the other side of the field road, about a hundred meters away, a tractor was turning in large circles, going around a narrow strip of wasteland. Comrade Nikolenko took out his glasses from his pocket and carefully looked at it for a while, and then pointed to the tractor and said to Farm Director Wang: "Look, they still don't cherish fuel and machines from the bottom of their hearts! This phenomenon is very bad. This is because the statistician did not correctly delineate the tractor's work area, or the tractor driver did not plow the land straight. We not only require the statistician to delineate the area correctly, but also strengthen the education of tractor drivers on saving fuel. We should cherish fuel drop by drop, so that every drop of fuel can be used in production to a valuable extent, and consume as little as possible on non-production."

    Comrade Nikolenko and Farm Director Wang were talking when suddenly, Comrade Nikolenko stood up and walked towards a nearby tractor as if he had discovered something. This was a machine that was about to depart, with five-furrow plows already attached. The engine was started, and the tractor was roaring in place, but there was no one in the cab. The tractor driver crawled under the plow to help the implement operator change the plowshare.

    "Look, they are letting the diesel fuel burn in vain like this. Why don't they turn off the throttle?" Comrade Nikolenko walked closer to the tractor and turned to Farm Director Wang who was following behind him. The translator hurriedly turned around to translate what he said to Farm Director Wang. At this time, the engine went out. A tractor driver had turned off the throttle, jumped out of the machine, glanced at the expert embarrassedly, and hurried to crawl under the plow to change the plowshare.

    "No need to translate. He already understands what I said and knows that he did something wrong. These young men are so smart. The important thing is to educate them so that they can often and consciously pay attention to saving fuel." Comrade Nikolenko smiled contentedly, as if he had completed a task.

    This is how Soviet experts taught us to cherish every small thing, cherish every piece of wood, a grass sack, a part, and save fuel drop by drop, paying attention to cherishing state property at all times.

    Learning from Soviet advanced experience and implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts is one of the most important factors in ensuring the smooth progress of our economic construction. From Soviet experts, we can learn not only advanced experience in organizing and managing enterprises; the Soviet experts' high sense of responsibility for state property and their conscientious spirit of thrift are also what we should earnestly learn.

    学习苏联专家厉行节约的高贵品质
    力文　鹤龄
    苏联赠送给国营友谊农场的农业机器一批又一批地运来，福利屯（农场筹备处的临时驻地）忙碌起来了，在零下十几度到三十度的严寒季节里，拖拉机手和农具手们紧张地接收机器，并把它及时运到各分场现场，把各项农具：犁、播种机、圆盘耙等随时安装起来。积极为春播和开荒进行准备工作。农场场长总顾问尼科连科同志常常到机器停放场亲自检查和指导机器的安装工作。他看到地上有乱丢的草袋，就建议场长把这些草袋子收拢起来，放在一定的地方，免得被糟蹋损失；用时也方便。他随时捡起乱丢在地上的铁钉子，并向有关同志建议，要把这些铁钉都清理起来。开始，同志们还不明白这个建议的意义，他耐心地向大家解释：“我们农场有不少胶轮车和汽车、崭新的机器，这些东西对它们的威胁很大，没有使用的新车新机器被扎坏了，这是多么令人难过的事！”
    尼科连科同志随时随地关心国家的资财，即使是很细小的东西，他也都看在眼里。有次他在散步，偶然看到装胜利牌汽车的木棚，在卸车时被弄坏了。在当天晚上举行的一次干部会议上，他郑重地提出来：“今天发生的一件事，令人感到不愉快，我们在卸小汽车时，却不经心地把装车的木头棚子也弄坏了……”说到这里，他顿了顿，那年迈的慈祥的脸上增添了几分严肃。“同志们应当了解，我们是不会一下子盖起汽车的车库的，汽车正是靠这些木头棚子挡风、挡雪和泥土，这是一方面；另一方面，我们农场刚刚开始建立，什么东西都还没有，一切都要由国家开支，现在的一块木板、一个草袋、一个铁搬子在今后农场的生产和建设中都会有它的一定用途，现成的物件就更不该损坏了。我们要教育职工对于一件大机具或小东西，都能想到：‘这是国家资财啊，要爱护它，发挥它的作用。’并逐渐养成这样一种良好习惯。”
    在紧张安装农具的日子里，根据苏联专家建议，总场部每晚开一个短短的碰头会，会上由副场长等负责人报告一天工作情况和明天的计划，尼科连科同志总是亲自出席。
    “三分场丢了一部分安装用的工具，缺少这些，就会影响安装工作的进行，他们请求补发……”在一次碰头会上，机务副总工程师报告说。
    尼科连科同志显然不安起来，在自己的小本子上急促地写着什么，眉头皱起来，听得非常精神贯注，怕放过翻译出的每一个字句似的。
    “我们一定不允许这种现象继续下去，一定的。这是一种对国家财产无人负责的现象，是我们把这些工具交给职工使用时，没有很好地贯彻责任制的结果。”从心眼里为这种轻易丢失工具的不良现象而难过的老专家尼科连科发言了，他接着讲下去：“在苏联，拖拉机手随便丢失自己机车上的工具，要自己来赔偿的，并把它当做一种制度来贯彻。每一件农业机具和工具都要有人负责使用、负责保管，而总机务工程师要对场长负责，并采取有效措施，来保证这些机器、农具、工具不发生不应有的损坏和丢失。我建议：要警告他们这种对待国家财产不负责任的作风，要使每个人了解国家财产是神圣不可侵犯的，谁也没有权利损坏它或任意丢掉它。否则，我们尽管再发工具，工具仍然会不足，机器安装工作依然没有保证。”
    尼科连科同志不仅在干部会议上多次讲爱护国家资财的重要，提出各项建议；他还经常深入现场，随时向对国家资财、公共财产抱漠不关心态度的现象进行尖锐的斗争。
    有一次，尼科连科同志到了五分场场部，正在行走，看见前面积雪里有几个黑乎乎的东西，忽然，老专家弯下身，赤手把雪拨开，把那东西拿出来，原来是火炉用的炉圈。老专家让人把分场管理员找来，对他说：“这炉圈很单薄，乱丢在雪道上，很容易被人踏坏，用着它时，又要重配了，你想没想到：这又要国家多一笔开支哩！”
    这时，在农具停放场附近，一个安装平台不规则地平躺在雪地上。安装平台是一块很平整的质量好的木板，包有铁皮，调整犁、播种机等农具时，用来调整水平的。几个人不经心地从安装平台上走过，被尼科连科同志看见了，他连忙告诉大家：安装平台是不能这样乱丢乱放的，地面是不够平的，人们在上面踏来踏去，安装平台就会失去调整水平的效能。这天，他严肃地批评了五分场的副场长，并告诉他，应该通过这些具体事实，提高职工认识和爱护国家资财的观念。
    开荒工作进入了高潮。尼科连科同志更多地到田间检查工作。他不仅关心开荒的正常进行，及时提出各项建议；他还十分关心开荒的成本。他曾多次强调说：“我们开荒进行得快，质量好，如果成本也很大，那就是我们的工作没做好，还没有很好地对国家尽到责任。”他重视油料节约，重视对拖拉机、农具的保养和爱护。他到生产队检查工作时，看到那个生产队农机具保养得好，暂时不用的机具，安放得很有条理，保持了清洁。一种衷心的喜悦立刻从他的满脸笑容中流露出来，这时，他总是高兴地一次又一次对人讲：“各个生产队都能这样，就好了，机器，有人使用它，也有人关心爱护它，它才能高度发挥作用！”当他在作业站看到农机具、零件随便乱放，或者有人漠不关心地浪费国家财产的时候，他感情的反映特别敏感，是那样全身为之难过啊！
    一天傍晚，第六生产队田间作业站的油库附近，集聚了六台拖拉机，白班和夜班的拖拉机手们正在换班。有的在检查机车螺丝，有的加油，夜班作业很快就要开始了。尼科连科同志同王场长坐在油库附近的一台灭花器的大梁上，他们在这里视察交班的情况。田间大道那边，一百公尺左右地方有一台拖拉机正在绕着很大的弯子，围着一窄条荒地打转。尼科连科同志从衣袋中取出眼镜，仔细端详了一会，然后指着那台拖拉机对王场长说：“你瞧，他们还没有从心眼里爱惜油料和机器啊！这种现象是很不好的。这是由于统计员对拖拉机作业小区，区划得不正确，或者是拖拉机手耕地耕得不直的结果。我们不仅要求统计员划区正确，还要加强对拖拉机手节省油料的教育。应当一滴一滴地珍惜油料，使每一滴油料都能在生产中得到有价值的利用，尽量少消耗到非生产上面。”
    尼科连科同志同王场长正在谈论，突然，尼科连科同志站起来，像发现了什么似的一直走向附近的一台拖拉机。这是一台正要出发的机车，五铧犁已经挂好了，发动机已发动，拖拉机在原地轰轰地叫，驾驶室内却空无一人，拖拉机手钻到犁下面帮助农具手换犁铲。
    “你瞧，他们就这样让柴油白白烧掉了，为什么不把油门关掉呢？”尼科连科同志走近拖拉机，转身对跟在后面的王场长说。翻译同志急忙转身想把他说的话，翻译给王场长，这时，发动机灭火了。一个拖拉机手已关掉油门，从机车上跳下来，不好意思地向专家看了一眼，又急忙钻到犁下面换犁铲去了。
    “不用翻译，他已经懂得我说了什么，知道自己做得不对了。这些小伙子们多聪明啊，重要的是要教育他们，能经常地自觉地注意节约油料。”尼科连科同志像完成一件心事似的，会心地笑了。
    苏联专家就是这样教导我们爱护每一件小的东西，珍惜每一块木板，一个草袋和一个零件，一滴一滴地节省油料。每时每刻注意爱护国家财产。
    学习苏联先进经验，贯彻苏联专家建议，这是我们保证经济建设顺利进行的一个最重要的因素之一。我们从苏联专家那里，不只可以学习到组织管理企业的先进经验；苏联专家这种对国家财产的高度责任感和兢兢业业地节约精神，也是我们应当认真学习的。
