    Soviet Newspapers Publish Articles
    Commemorating the Fiftieth Anniversary of Lenin's Work "Two Tactics"
    (Dispatch from our Moscow correspondent, August 9th) To mark the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of Lenin's brilliant work "Two Tactics," Moscow newspapers published commemorative articles today, August 9th. An article in "Pravda" pointed out that this work is the most vivid example of the organic combination of Marxist theory and the practice of the proletarian revolutionary struggle. After introducing the significance of this work in the Russian Revolution, the article stated: "Lenin's doctrine regarding the leadership of the proletariat in any people's revolution and the transformation of the bourgeois-democratic revolution into a socialist revolution has also been brilliantly evidenced in the experience of many European and Asian revolutions that have arisen since World War II." The article said: "The victory of the Chinese people's revolution, achieved under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, is a true triumph of Marxist-Leninist strategy and tactics. The People's Republic of China has essentially completed the enormous tasks of a democratic nature and has turned to the foundation of building socialism. The people's democratic state, led by the working class and based on the solid alliance of workers and peasants, is a powerful weapon for China to build a socialist economy. The Chinese people are fighting with great enthusiasm to realize the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy and for the industrialization of the country." The article stated: The fiftieth anniversary of the publication of Lenin's "Two Tactics" is being commemorated under the conditions of great victories of Leninism in the Soviet Union and internationally. An article in "Izvestia" stated: "The powerful force of Lenin's strategy and tactics has been proven by life and tested by the experience of the world-historically significant victories and revolutionary achievements of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all people's democratic countries." An article in "Trud" stated: "Lenin's thought is embodied in the revolutionary activities of the Communist Parties of the great China and all European and Asian people's democratic countries. The Communist and Workers' Parties of these countries have creatively applied Lenin's strategy and tactics, have achieved remarkable victories, and are confidently guiding the workers forward towards socialism."
