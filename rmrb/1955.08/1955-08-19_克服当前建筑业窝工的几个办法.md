Several Ways to Overcome Current Stoppage of Work in the Construction Industry
　　Wang Qi
　　The construction projects contracted by the North China Engineering Management Bureau of the Ministry of Construction in 1955 were determined relatively late, and the design changes were significant. In addition, there were very few projects carried over from 1954, and they were mostly interior decoration and miscellaneous outdoor projects, which led to a large trend of work stoppages. According to statistics from the Taiyuan Engineering Bureau, Baotou and Datong Engineering General Companies, and directly affiliated companies under the bureau, technical workers were expected to be idle for approximately 667,000 workdays from March to June this year. To solve this problem, the North China Engineering Management Bureau adopted the following measures.
　　First, actively strengthen contact and cooperation with the client (甲方), and concentrate efforts on construction preparation for projects with better conditions and simpler designs to strive for early commencement. According to incomplete statistics from Baotou and Datong Engineering General Companies, projects covering over 128,000 square meters started early in May, which solved the problem of large-scale work stoppages in these two companies.
　　Second, strictly enforce recruitment discipline, stipulating that each unit must obtain approval from the Ministry of Construction even to recruit one temporary worker; the required laborers (壮工) should be selected from the surplus technical workers. In recent years, due to the blind recruitment of workers by various units, the types of workers in the bureau were not commensurate with the tasks undertaken, and the ratio of skilled workers to laborers was also imbalanced. For example, laborers accounted for only about 7% of the total fixed workers, resulting in the strange phenomenon of recruiting large numbers of temporary workers on the one hand, while having a large number of technical workers with nothing to do on the other hand. This phenomenon has been basically reversed this year. From March to June, technical workers were used as laborers for a total of 378,000 workdays. Although the state subsidized the wage difference between technical workers and laborers by more than 367,000 yuan, it was still a saving of more than 805,000 yuan compared to the past practice of recruiting laborers from outside while also paying for work stoppages.
　　Third, strengthen contact with fraternal companies and related parties, and fully support units in need of workers. This not only reduces the need for units requiring workers to recruit externally, but also prevents losses caused by work stoppages in the unit, while also increasing workers' income. Because workers loaned out generally still work as skilled workers, even if they become laborers, the state will supplement their wages according to their original standard wage to make up the difference between their skilled worker wage and their laborer wage. Calculating on the basis that each technical worker doing laborer work can reach at least 80% of the laborer quota, their income can increase by 20% compared to when they are idle. According to statistics from March to June, the average monthly income of loaned-out technical workers was more than 12 yuan higher than when they were idle. Loaned-out workers worked a total of more than 188,000 workdays.
　　Fourth, carefully review the worker needs plans of subordinate units, tap potential, and vigorously carry out balancing work. For a long time, the units under the bureau have only been accustomed to using too much labor and are not accustomed to balanced construction. This time, special attention was paid to balanced construction when dealing with the issue of work stoppages. For example, when each unit originally planned to increase temporary workers by 3,000 in May and June, the leaders of the bureau immediately stopped it, preventing artificial waste.
　　Fifth, postpone the reporting time for pre-arranged workers. According to preliminary calculations, the Taiyuan Engineering Bureau and directly affiliated companies under the bureau have a total of more than 5,700 pre-arranged workers. Postponing the reporting date from March 15 to the end of July can reduce work stoppage losses by approximately 190,000 workdays and reduce workers' futile travel time.
　　Sixth, the North China Engineering Management Bureau gave strong assistance to workers who requested resignation and transfer to other occupations with legitimate reasons. From January to May this year, a total of more than 670 workers were assisted in resolving their resignation or transfer issues, which not only provided these workers with reasonable arrangements but also reduced losses caused by work stoppages.
　　Due to the bureau's active adoption of the above measures, wages alone were saved by 913,712 yuan. Moreover, the part of the technical workers loaned out and used in change of work also created more than 8.5 million yuan of wealth for the country. At the same time, workers also increased their income compared to when they were idle and improved their production enthusiasm.
　　To ensure that the above methods can be well implemented, it is necessary to strengthen leadership over deployment work. In recent months, the bureau has appointed leaders to be specifically responsible for deployment work, and has criticized various incorrect ideas, and strengthened the education of employees on the concept of the overall situation. For example, in the early stage of change of work, many technical workers were afraid of being tired and not receiving standard wages, and were unwilling to do it. Units using workers were afraid that the use of technical workers would not meet the laborer quota and increase labor costs. Units loaning out workers believed that they were working for others and were unwilling to make up the difference in wages. To solve this problem, in addition to getting through the ideas of leaders and workers in various units, the bureau also helped technical workers quickly reach the laborer quota. The method is to adjust the labor organization as much as possible while maintaining the original technical worker group organization form. Technical workers used as laborers should be deployed in rotation from the group, so that workers feel comfortable and it is easy to reach and break the quota. It is also easier to reach and break the quota by assigning work according to the usual work nature of the technical workers. For example, riggers and lime-soil workers usually use their arms to operate, so when used as laborers, they can be assigned to dig trenches; steel workers often move steel bars, so when changed to laborers, they can be assigned to do transportation work. The bureau also criticized the erroneous thinking of some unit leaders who were unwilling to lend out workers because they were waiting for construction to start. Serious handling was also carried out in a timely manner for incidents in which certain units did not comply with the system and recruited workers indiscriminately, so that the staff of each unit could ideologically recognize that saving labor is an important content of opposing waste and increasing enterprise accumulation. In this way, the deployment of labor was carried out more smoothly, and the problem of work stoppages was gradually resolved.

    克服当前建筑业窝工的几个办法
    汪圻
    建筑工程部华北工程管理总局一九五五年度承包的工程，确定较晚，图纸的变动很大，加之一九五四年跨年度的工程很少，又多为室内修饰和室外零星工程，因而形成了大量窝工的趋势。据该局所属太原工程局，包头、大同两个工程总公司和直属公司等四个单位的统计，今年三月至六月技术工人要窝工约六十六万七千多个工日。为了解决这个问题，华北工程管理总局采用了下面几种办法。
    第一、主动地加强同甲方的联系和协作，对条件较好、设计较简单的工程，集中力量进行施工准备，争取提前开工。据包头和大同两个工程总公司的不完全统计，在五月份提前开工的工程有十二万八千多平方公尺，解决了这两个公司大量窝工的问题。
    第二、严格招工纪律，规定各单位即使招收一名临时工也要经建筑工程部批准；所需要的壮工，一律由剩余的技术工人中选用。几年来，由于各单位盲目招雇工人，致使该局的工人在工种上同所担负的任务不相称，技工同壮工的比例也不相称。如壮工仅占固定工人总数的百分之七左右，因而就出现了一方面要大批招收临时工，另一方面却有大批技术工人无工可做的怪现象。今年基本上扭转了这种现象。从三月至六月，将技工当壮工使用共达三十七万八千多个工日，虽然国家补贴了技术工人和壮工的工资差额三十六万七千多元，但同过去一方面向外招收壮工另一方面还要支出窝工费比较，还是节省了八十万五千多元。
    第三、加强同兄弟公司及有关方面的联系，全力支持需要工人的单位。这样既可使需要工人的单位减少外出招工，也使本单位避免了因窝工而造成损失，同时还增加了工人的收入。因为借出去的工人一般仍做技工，即便变为壮工，因国家按本人原标准工资补足其变为壮工的工资，按每个技术工人做壮工工作最低能达到壮工定额百分之八十计算，就可较窝工时增加收入百分之二十。根据三月份至六月份的统计，借出去的技术工人每人每月平均比窝工时增加收入十二元多。借出去的工人一共做了十八万八千多个工日。
    第四、认真审查所属各单位需要工人的计划，挖掘潜力，并大力进行平衡工作。长期以来，该局所属各单位只习惯于过多地使用劳动力，不惯于均衡施工。这次处理窝工问题时，特别注意均衡施工。如各单位原计划五、六两个月增加临时工三千名，局的领导上立即加以制止，防止了人为的浪费。
    第五、推迟预约工的报到时间。据初步计算，该局所属太原工程局和直属公司共有预约工人五千七百多人，将报到期由三月十五日推迟到七月底，约可减少十九万个工日的窝工损失，并减少了工人的往返徒劳时间。
    第六、华北工程管理总局对有正当理由要求离职和转业的工人都给以大力协助。从今年一月至五月，共协助六百七十多名工人解决了离职或转业问题，不但使这部分工人得到了合理的安置，同时也减少了窝工造成的损失。
    由于该局积极采取了以上各项措施，仅工资就节省了九十一万三千七百一十二元。而且借出和变工使用的这部分技工还给国家多创造了八百五十多万元的财富；同时，工人也都较窝工时增加了收入，提高了生产情绪。
    要使上述办法能很好地贯彻，必须加强对调配工作的领导。几个月来，该局指定领导人员专门负责调配工作，并对各种不正确的思想进行了批判，加强了对职工进行整体观念的教育。如在变工初期，不少技工怕累、怕得不到标准工资而不愿干；用工单位怕用技工时达不到壮工定额和加大劳动力的成本；借出工人的单位认为给别人干活而不愿意补出工资的差额。为了解决这个问题，该局除了打通各单位领导工作人员和工人的思想外，还帮助技工迅速达到壮工的定额。办法是尽可能地在保持原来技工小组的组织形式下调整劳动组织，变为壮工使用的技术工人要从小组中轮流调配，这样工人觉得顺手，就很容易达到和突破定额。根据技工平时的工作性质分配工作，也较容易达到和突破定额。如起重工和灰土工日常用双手臂来操作，如当壮工使用时可分配去挖槽；钢筋工常搬用钢筋，如变为壮工时可分配做搬运工作。该局也批判了某些单位的领导工作人员因等待开工而不愿向外借工人的错误思想。对某些单位不遵守制度、乱招工人的事件也及时进行了严肃的处理，使各单位的工作人员从思想上认识节约使用劳动力是反对浪费、增加企业积累的重要内容。这样，才使劳动力的调配工作较顺利地开展起来，逐步解决了窝工的问题。
