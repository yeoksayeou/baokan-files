Who is "Jing Hao"?
Xu Ciwen

On the evening of January 26th this year, Xu Fengshan and his wife, who run a candy stall in Hongde Lane, Seventh District of Tianjin, were about to close up when a middle-aged man came to buy cigarettes. The man took out an old one-thousand-yuan note from his pocket, gave it to old man Xu, took the cigarettes, and left.

The note was too dirty, and old man Xu noticed that there were densely written characters on it. The old couple were illiterate and asked someone literate at the entrance of the alley to take a look.

"What's written on it is all reactionary talk! You should report it to the police station!" someone told them after reading it.

Old man Xu went to the police station, told the duty police officer what had happened, and handed over the banknote. The police officer carefully asked about the man's appearance, the direction he went, etc., and immediately reported it to the Seventh Public Security Sub-bureau, which in turn reported it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau.

The Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau had received such reports more than once. Since January 15th, such reports had been constantly heard. Those who received these banknotes included the gong beater at the Xin Xin Tea House in the Liuhe Market, the cashier at the sales department of the Municipal Department Store, as well as the manager of a coal yard, the manager of a tofu shop, and tricycle workers. These banknotes with reactionary slogans were distributed in many places such as the Seventh District, the Third District, the Sixth District, and the First District, and the handwriting on these notes was all written by one person.

By February, the case had become even more bizarre. Among the banknotes that the masses voluntarily handed over to the public security department, not only were there reactionary slogans, but they were also numbered, stamped with an oval seal bearing the name "Jing Hao," and the words "Anti-Soviet National Salvation Army, Jing Yeshui Declares" were written.

Obviously, the enemy's sabotage activities were being carried out in a planned manner.

One day, the person in charge of the public security department summoned the investigators.

"It can be said that the case is complicated," he told the investigators. "The enemy's activities have aroused the resentment of many people, who unanimously demand that we solve the case quickly. However, the enemy's activities are so widespread and the reactionary slogans are spreading so quickly that they have created certain difficulties for our investigation work..."

"It seems that this person who signs 'Jing Hao' has quite a few tricks. He makes it difficult for us to find clues from the people who received the banknotes. However, with the support of the masses, we are still confident," the investigator said calmly and firmly.

After a pause, the leader instructed, "We should first find out the laws and means of the enemy's activities. In carrying out our work, we must resolutely rely on the masses..."

A month passed. When the new Renminbi was issued, the enemy's activities became even more rampant. These reactionary phrases had appeared on the new Renminbi. At this time, more and more people reported to the public security department. Soon, with the help of the masses, the investigators learned about the following incident.

On the afternoon of March 23rd, around four o'clock, housewife Sun Yuzhen, holding her child, hired a tricycle from her aunt's house in Tucheng to return to Wandezhuang. When she arrived home, Sun Yuzhen gave the driver five jiao, and he gave her back two five-fen notes. In the evening, Sun Yuzhen took these two five-fen notes to the cooperative to buy things. At that time, Yang Zhande, the cashier of the cooperative, found that one of the banknotes had a reactionary slogan written on it.

When the public security personnel went to visit Sun Yuzhen, Sun Yuzhen angrily said, "This counter-revolutionary element is really despicable. He not only carries out reactionary propaganda but also attempts to harm us ordinary people who receive such banknotes. We hate this bad egg!"

After understanding, Sun Yuzhen and her husband could not write.

"Obviously, this banknote was already written on when the tricycle driver gave it to her," the investigator thought. From this incident, he also related it to many facts that had happened before. For example, an employee of the Huasha Cloth Company fell ill and had to go to the People's Hospital for treatment. After taking a tricycle to the People's Hospital, two of the banknotes that the driver gave him back had reactionary phrases written on them. Jie Yunsheng, a cadre of the Tianjin Branch of the People's Insurance Company of China, had his son, Jie Songshi, return to Tianjin from Inner Mongolia, and then took a tricycle home. One of the banknotes that the driver gave him back also had a reactionary slogan written on it…

"Why are these things happening all related to tricycles?" The investigator pondered, and he already had a preliminary answer in his mind.

One day, the Fourth Public Security Sub-bureau reported a very valuable piece of material to the Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau:

On the evening of March 19th, it was almost ten o'clock, and there were only a few pedestrians on the road. Wang Hongbin, a student at the No. 17 Elementary School in the Fourth District, was helping his family sell radishes at their stall. A man bought two hundred yuan (old currency) worth of radishes and gave Wang Hongbin five hundred yuan (old currency). Wang Hongbin gave him back three hundred yuan (old currency), and the man strode away.

In the evening, when Wang Hongbin returned home, he found that the five-hundred-yuan (old currency) note was covered with reactionary slogans. The next day, Wang Hongbin immediately reported the matter to the police station.

The location where this incident occurred was right next to the Trade Union Fourth District Tricycle Workers' Committee.

The investigator, with the help of the workers of the Trade Union Fourth District Tricycle Workers' Committee, obtained a very important clue.

It turned out that among the members of the Tricycle Workers' Union in the Fourth District, there was such a person. He usually said reactionary things, whether while pedaling the tricycle or when chatting with other tricycle workers at the tricycle parking spot. He could write and read, and sometimes when reading the newspaper to the tricycle workers, he deliberately distorted the words in the newspaper. He often eavesdropped on "Voice of America"….

The investigator also visited other tricycle workers and learned that the reactionary propaganda carried out by this "tricycle worker" and the reactionary phrases written on the Renminbi were almost identical in content.

The investigator carefully learned about the person's appearance, the shape of his tricycle, and obtained a photo of the person.

The investigator once again learned from Wang Pixiu, an employee of the Huasha Cloth Company, and Sun Yuzhen, a housewife, who had previously received this kind of Renminbi, that the appearance of the "tricycle worker" they encountered and the shape of the tricycle they rode were the same. And these situations were consistent with the information that the investigator learned from the Fourth District Tricycle Workers' Committee.

Later, based on the information provided by the tricycle workers in the Fourth District, the investigator successively grasped some reliable evidence about this "tricycle worker"—directly obtaining Renminbi with reactionary slogans written on it from his hands.

At noon on April 20th, an old lady who had just come from the countryside hailed a tricycle from the intersection of Shanxi Road and Shenyang Road to take her to the Renli Woolen Mill on Shashi Road in the Fifth District. When she arrived at Shashi Road, the old lady gave the tricycle worker five jiao, and the man gave her back two jiao. The old lady did not get out of the car and kept turning the two notes over in her hands, muttering, "This note is so dirty, I don't want it..."

At this time, public security personnel appeared. Taking the banknote, they saw that it was covered with rows of reactionary slogans.

The "tricycle worker" turned pale immediately upon seeing this situation.

The public security personnel searched his pockets and found that both pockets of his jacket contained Renminbi; however, one side contained banknotes without writing, and the other contained banknotes with reactionary slogans.

"You have finally been found by us…." A look of contempt appeared on the faces of the public security personnel.

Later, as a result of the search of his home by the public security personnel, a seal bearing the name "Jing Hao" was found in his residence.

It was confirmed from the preliminary trial that this counter-revolutionary element was called Mao Guanghui. Before liberation, he was a Japanese puppet police officer who had received training at the Jinan Railway Police Training Institute of the Japanese puppet regime. After liberation, he often eavesdropped on the "Voice of America," spreading rumors and confusing the public. He used the method of numbering and signing each banknote one by one, and successively distributed Renminbi with reactionary slogans written on them to people who were illiterate or in urgent need more than one hundred and twenty times, but he ultimately failed to escape the giant palm of the people.

    “景浩”是谁
    许慈文
    今年一月二十六日傍晚，天津市第七区洪德里摆糖摊的徐凤山夫妇正要收摊，一个中年人来买烟。这个人从口袋里掏出一千元一张的旧币，交给了徐老头，拿了烟便走了。
    这张票子太脏了，徐老头看见上面还写着密密麻麻的字。老夫妇俩谁也不识字，顺便请胡同口识字的人给瞧瞧。
    “上面写的都是反动话呀！快到派出所去报告吧！”一个人看了以后告诉他们。
    徐老头到了派出所，把经过情形告诉了值班民警，并且交出了这张钞票。民警仔细地问了那人的长相，是往什么方向走的，……然后立即报告了公安七分局，七分局又报告了市公安局。
    天津市公安局得到这样的报告已经不止一次了。从一月十五日以来，就不断听到这种反映。得到这些钞票的人，有六合市场新新茶社打锣的人，有市百货公司售货处的收款人，还有煤厂经理、豆腐房的经理、三轮工人……。这些写有反动标语的钞票，散发在七区、三区、六区、一区等很多地方，而这些票子上的笔迹全是一个人写的。
    到了二月份，案情发展得更离奇了。在群众自动交到公安部门来的钞票中，不仅写有反动的标语，还编了号，盖上了署名“景浩”的楕圆形图章，并且写着“反苏救国军，景页水宣”九个字。
    显然，敌人的破坏活动是有计划地进行着。
    这一天，公安部门的负责人召见了侦察员。
    “可以说，案子是复杂的。”他对侦察员说：“敌人的活动已引起很多群众的愤恨，一致要求我们迅速破案，但目前敌人活动的面如此的广，反动标语散发得这样快，给我们的侦察工作造成了一定的困难。……”
    “看来，这个署名‘景浩’的人好像很有些办法。他使得我们从得到钞票的人当中很难找到线索。不过，有群众的支持，我们还是有信心的。”侦察员沉着而坚定地说。
    停了停，首长指示说：“我们应当首先摸清敌人活动的规律和手段。在进行工作时，一定要坚决地依靠群众……。”
    时间过了一个月。到了发行新人民币的时候，敌人的活动更加猖狂了。这种反动词句已经出现在新人民币上。这时，群众向公安部门检举的越来越多，不久，侦察员在群众的协助下了解到下面一件事情。
    三月二十三日下午四点多钟，家庭妇女孙玉珍抱着她的小孩从土城姨娘家雇了一辆三轮车回到万德庄来。到了家，孙玉珍给蹬车的人五角钱，他找回两张五分的票子。晚上，孙玉珍拿着这两张五分的票子到合作社去买东西。当时，合作社收款人杨占德发现其中的一张钞票上，写有反动标语。
    当公安人员前往访问孙玉珍时，孙玉珍气愤地说：“这个反革命分子真是卑鄙极了。他不光进行反动宣传，还企图坑害我们收到这种票子的老百姓。我们恨死这个坏蛋了！”
    经过了解，孙玉珍和她的丈夫都不会写字。
    “显然，这张钞票是蹬三轮车的人给她的时候就已经写上了。”侦察员这样想着。从这件事，他又联系到以前发生的许多事实，譬如，花纱布公司有
  一个工作人员得了急病要上人民医院去看病，坐三轮车到了人民医院后，从蹬车人找回的钞票中，发现有两张钞票的票面上写着反动词句；中国人民保险公司天津分公司干部接韵笙的儿子接淞石从内蒙古回到天津，然后坐三轮车回家，从蹬车人找给他的钞票中，也有一张票面上写着反动标语……。
    “为什么发生的这些事都和三轮车有关系呢？”侦察员思索着，在他的脑子里已经有了初步的答案。
    这一天，公安四分局向天津市公安局报告了一件非常有价值的材料：
    三月十九日晚上快十点钟了，路上只有几个行人。四区十七小学学生王鸿彬正在帮助家里摆摊卖萝卜。有一个男人到摊上买了二百元（旧币）萝卜，给了王鸿彬五百元（旧币）。王鸿彬找给了他三百元（旧币），那人便大踏步地走开了。
    晚上，王鸿彬回家一看，发现这五百元（旧币）的票子上，写满了反动标语。第二天，王鸿彬马上把这事向派出所报告了。
    这件事发生的地点，就在工会四区三轮工作委员会的旁边。
    侦察员得到工会四区三轮工作委员会工人的帮助，获得了一个非常重要的线索。
    原来在四区三轮工会的会员中，有这样一个人。他平时无论在蹬三轮时，或是在三轮车停车处和别的三轮工人闲谈时，常常说反动话。他能写会读，有时给三轮工人读报时，故意把报上的话加以歪曲。他常偷听“美国之音”……。
    侦察员又访问了其他的三轮工人，又得知这个“三轮工人”所进行的反动宣传和在人民币上写的反动词句内容几乎完全相同。
    侦察员仔细了解了那个人的长相，和他的三轮车的外形，并且得到了那个人的相片。
    侦察员再次从以前得到过这种人民币的花纱布公司工作人员王丕修和家庭妇女孙玉珍那里，了解到他们所碰见的“三轮工人”的长相和乘坐的三轮车的外形都是一样的。而这些情况和侦察员从四区三轮工作委员会所了解的情况又是一致的。
    后来，根据四区三轮工人们提供的这些情况，侦察员陆续掌握了这个“三轮工人”的一些可靠的证据——从他的手里直接得到了写有反动标语的人民币。
    四月二十日中午，一个刚从乡下来的老太太从山西路沈阳道口叫了一辆三轮车拉她到五区沙市道仁立毛织厂去。到了沙市道，老太太给三轮工人五角钱，那人找回了二角钱。老太太没有下车，手里拿着那两张票子左翻右看，嘴上嘟囔着说：“这张票子这么脏，我不要……。”
    这时，公安人员出现了。接过钞票一看，上面写着一行行的反动标语。
    这个“三轮工人”看到这种情形，脸色立刻变得十分苍白。
    公安人员搜查了他的口袋，发现在他的上衣的两个口袋里，都放有人民币；可是，一边是放着没有字的，一边是涂写了反动标语的。
    “你终于被我们找到了。……”公安人员的脸上显露出轻蔑的微笑。
    后来，公安人员在他家里进行搜查的结果，在他的住屋里，查获了署名“景浩”的图章。
    从预审中证实，这个反革命分子叫毛光辉。解放前他是曾经受过日伪济南铁路警务训练所训练的日伪警务手。解放后，他经常偷听“美国之音”，造谣惑众。他用逐券编号署名的办法，对于一些不识字或事务紧急的人，先后散发了写有反动标语的人民币达一百二十多次，但他终究没有能逃出人民的巨掌。（原载天津日报，本报略有修改）
