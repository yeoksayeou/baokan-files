    We, the People of All Circles in the Capital, at this conference against atomic warfare and the use of atomic weapons, enthusiastically respond to the call of Premier Zhou Enlai of our country at the Second Session of the First National People’s Congress to oppose atomic war, demand that the world implement disarmament, and make unremitting efforts to ease international tensions and strive for universal and lasting peace. We respond to the appeal issued by the Asian Countries Conference in New Delhi and the World Peace Conference in Helsinki to the people of Asia and the world to unite and struggle together against atomic war and the use of atomic weapons.
    We Chinese people love peace. We are working to successfully realize the Five-Year Plan for socialist construction. We oppose war. We demand a peaceful environment, and we especially oppose atomic war and any testing and use of atomic weapons. We strongly hate all forms of atomic blackmail. We are grateful to the great Soviet people for assisting our country in using atomic energy for peaceful construction, and we sincerely hope that atomic energy will be mastered and controlled by all mankind and used for peaceful purposes. All people in the world who oppose atomic war will always remember that the 600 million Chinese people are their staunch and faithful comrades-in-arms in opposing atomic war.
    It is no accident that the World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs is being held in Hiroshima, where the first atomic bomb destroyed the lives of 200,000 people ten years ago. The Japanese people have suffered twice from atomic bomb attacks and once from hydrogen bomb tests in just ten years. Moreover, ten years after suffering the atomic bomb disaster, Japan is becoming a base for atomic weapons such as "atomic missiles" and "atomic cannons." Many of Japan's peaceful farmlands and scenic spots are being transformed into atomic weapons firing ranges and atomic weapons storage facilities. We Chinese people extend our sincere condolences to the plight of the Japanese people. The Japanese people's struggle against atomic war and the use of atomic weapons will receive the warm support of the Chinese people. We express our regret that the Chinese delegation headed by Liu Ningyi was unable to fully attend the Hiroshima conference due to the Japanese government only issuing partial visas. We would like to tell the Japanese people that the Chinese people have always been friends of the Japanese people. No matter how some people try to create a poisonous atmosphere that undermines the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese peoples, the Chinese people will steadfastly move forward to strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples and restore normal relations between China and Japan as soon as possible.
    We would like to extend our congratulations to the World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs that opened in Hiroshima on August 6. We firmly believe that all peace-loving people in the world who oppose atomic war and the use of atomic weapons will unite to achieve greater success in the great cause of permanently stopping atomic war and making atomic energy serve the noble peaceful purposes of mankind!

    首都各界人民反对原子战争与反对使用原子武器大会决议
    我们首都各界人民反对原子战争与反对使用原子武器大会，热烈地响应我国周恩来总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上关于反对原子战争，要求全世界实行裁减军备，为缓和国际紧张局势与争取普遍的持久的和平而作不懈努力的号召；我们响应新德里亚洲国家会议和赫尔辛基世界和平大会向亚洲和全世界人民发出的为反对原子战争与反对使用原子武器而共同团结奋斗的呼吁。
    我们中国人民是热爱和平的。我们正为胜利地实现社会主义建设五年计划而劳动。我们反对战争。我们要求和平的环境，我们尤其反对原子战争，反对原子武器的任何试验和使用。我们强烈地憎恨一切形式的原子讹诈。我们感谢伟大的苏联人民援助我国将原子能用于和平建设事业上，我们热烈地希望原子能被全人类所掌握控制而使用于和平用途上。全世界反对原子战争的所有人们当会时刻地记忆着，六万万中国人民是他们坚决反对原子战争的忠实的战友。
    禁止原子弹、氢弹世界大会恰在十年前第一颗原子弹毁灭了二十万人生命的广岛举行这件事，决不是偶然的。日本人民仅在十年之间即遭受到两次原子弹轰炸和一次氢弹试验的灾害，并且，在蒙受了原子弹灾难十年后的今天，日本又正在成为“原子飞弹”、“原子炮”等原子武器的基地。不少的日本和平耕地与名胜古迹正在被转变成为原子武器的射击场与原子武器的储备所。我们中国人民对日本人民所处的灾难处境致以亲切的慰问。日本人民反对原子战争与反对使用原子武器的斗争，都将得到中国人民的热烈支持。我们对这次以刘宁一为首的中国代表团由于日本政府只发部分签证因而未能全部前往日本参加广岛大会一事，表示遗憾。我们愿意告诉日本人民，中国人民始终是日本人民的朋友。不管有些人怎样地企图制造破坏中日两国人民友好关系的毒害气氛，中国人民将为加强中日人民的友好与早日恢复中日间正常关系而坚定地前进。
    我们谨向八月六日在广岛开幕的禁止原子弹、氢弹世界大会表示祝贺。我们坚信全世界反对原子战争，反对使用原子武器的所有爱好和平的人民将团结起来，为着永远遏止原子战争，使原子能为人类崇高的和平用途服务的伟大事业，获得更大的成就！
