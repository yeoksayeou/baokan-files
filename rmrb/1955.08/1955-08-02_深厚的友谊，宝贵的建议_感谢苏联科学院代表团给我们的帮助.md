    Profound Friendship, Valuable Advice
    – Thanking the Soviet Academy of Sciences Delegation for Their Help
    Yan Jici, Director of the Technical Sciences Division of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
    In late April of this year, the delegation from the Soviet Academy of Sciences, led by Academician I.P. Bardin, Vice President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, visited our country. As one of the accompanying personnel, I was honored to have more contact with the delegation, especially with Academician Bardin and Academician Kostenko. Their high degree of Marxist-Leninist ideological principles, profound knowledge, selfless enthusiasm for labor, and sincere, fraternal internationalist spirit have left an indelible impression on everyone's minds.
    Accelerating the speed of industrialization requires first adopting the world's most advanced technologies, and continuously improving quality and reducing costs while increasing output and variety. Academician Bardin pointed out that the fastest way to develop the steel industry in China, given its current small steel production and lack of abundant scrap steel, is to adopt converter steelmaking. The biggest advantages of converter steelmaking are fast construction, low investment, high yield, and low cost. A twenty-ton converter can produce as much steel per day as a two-hundred-ton open-hearth furnace because it can produce steel once every half hour. In recent years, with the adoption of new technologies such as oxygen blowing and vacuum treatment, the quality of converter steel is no different from that of open-hearth steel. It can be said that converter steelmaking has undergone a technological revolution. It has been revived from a once-abandoned position and has a promising future. Therefore, in the design of China's new steel bases, measures should be considered to adopt a large number of new converter steelmaking methods. This is an important technical policy related to the development of China's steel industry.
    Academician Bardin repeatedly emphasized the superiority of using oxygen for steelmaking. The application of this new technology is not limited to converters; its application in open-hearth and electric furnaces can also improve steel quality, shorten smelting time, and increase productivity by 15% to 20%. As for the supply of large amounts of oxygen, thanks to the great achievements of the Soviet physicist Academician Kapitza, a highly efficient and easy-to-operate oxygen generator has been created. The contribution of the Soviet Union's brand-new scientific achievements to communist construction is enormous. We should intensify our studies and strengthen our already started experimental work on using oxygen for steelmaking to promote the better and faster development of the steel industry.
    Continuously adopting advanced technologies to improve the efficiency of existing equipment and fully utilize the potential capabilities of existing enterprises is one of the principles of socialist construction. After visiting several small steel plants in China, Academician Bardin believed that the emergence and existence of these small steel plants was not accidental but was closely related to regional needs. If they could be technically improved and their capabilities fully utilized, it would play a role in accelerating China's socialist industrialization. Based on Soviet construction experience, Academician Bardin judged that these steel plants could be used for at least another twenty-five years. Therefore, the policy towards them should not be to let them fend for themselves, but to actively equip and transform them with advanced technology so that they can better serve socialist construction. One of the important measures to improve small steel plants to a modern level is to use ingot casting machines for continuous or semi-continuous casting. The use of new ingot casting machines can greatly reduce the heavy labor of the ingot casting section, eliminate the consumption of refractory materials caused by the current bottom-pouring method, reduce the formation of inclusions in the steel ingots, and increase productivity. Casting these small steel ingots is precisely the task of small steel plants, and the small steel ingots they produce are precisely the products needed in large quantities for construction. Clearly defining the task in this way will better play the role of existing enterprises.
    Lenin once said: "Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country." The foundation of electrification is the motor manufacturing industry, and the level of the motor manufacturing industry determines the degree of electrification of a country. Therefore, it is necessary to strive to develop the motor manufacturing industry to meet the needs of socialist industrialization and national electrification. After visiting various parts of China, Academician Kostenko believed that, given the current conditions of motor manufacturing in China, there is sufficient possibility to develop rapidly. However, the potential power has not been fully utilized, which is reflected in the small capacity of single machines, low total output value, and conservative production plans. Specialization of production can greatly increase the speed of production. There should be a good division of labor among the various motor manufacturing plants, and even a workshop should be specialized as much as possible. This will speed up the development of the motor manufacturing industry to meet the country's construction needs for large-capacity power equipment.
    Academician Kostenko pointed out that another advanced method to speed up production and expand production volume is to carry out series production of motors. The determination of a series should be very cautious and should go through serious and extensive theoretical calculations and experimental research work. Because once a series design is determined, it is very difficult to change it later due to production conditions. In the Soviet Union, there was a motor serialization committee composed of experts from industrial departments, the Academy of Sciences, and universities to determine the motor series produced by each factory. At present, China's motor manufacturing industry has not paid enough attention to this issue and should consider making the most appropriate choice, adopting the latest series, and sending experienced engineers to the Soviet design department to select the information we need and to the manufacturing plants to specifically understand the issues that should be paid special attention to in the manufacturing of these designs.
    Academician Kostenko also repeatedly reminded us to pay attention to the preparations for the electrification of China's railways as soon as possible. Many countries, including the Soviet Union, have taken some detours on the issue of railway electrification. In recent years, scientific work has proven that the single-phase 50 Hz AC system is more economical and reasonable than the DC system and has been widely used in countries such as France and Hungary. Today, when China is beginning railway electrification, it should carefully consider, conduct specialized research, and carry out construction at the most advanced scientific and technological level to accelerate the development of the transportation industry, which is of great significance to the national economy.
    The comrades of the Soviet Academy of Sciences delegation were very excited to see that the scientific research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, government industrial departments, and universities have developed so rapidly and that funding and equipment are so abundant. However, they also pointed out very sincerely that China's scientific foundation is generally weak. Although there is a large number of new forces, there are relatively few experienced scientific researchers, and the work in all aspects is far behind the needs of national construction.
    China's scientific research is in its initial and growing stages. The research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences do not yet include the necessary scientific fields. They made suggestions on which research institutions should be established in the next few years and how to establish them.
    The various research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences should become the centers of various specialized scientific research networks and play a major role in the development of the national economy. In the current situation, most of the work carried out by the various research institutes of the Technical Sciences Division of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is still fragmented and passive, and they are excessively burdened with the work of providing technical support to factories, so they do not have the strength to study more important, long-term, and comprehensive issues. The Soviet Academy of Sciences delegation believed that this was unavoidable in the past, but it cannot remain at this stage for a long time. There should be an appropriate division of labor with the research institutions of industrial departments, and they should assist the industrial departments in establishing their own research institutions.
    Regarding the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics and the Institute of Metals of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Academician Bardin pointed out that research on ore beneficiation, reduction, and sintering, research on heat exchange, heat balance, heat transfer, material operation, and gas dynamics in the metallurgical process should be carried out and strengthened, and research on the smelting process, various alloys required for new technologies such as heat-resistant alloy systems, heat-stable alloys required for high-temperature and high-pressure chemistry, alloys used for manufacturing precision instruments, and a series of issues related to metal welding, metal corrosion, metal processing, and metal physics should be strengthened. He finally said that his suggestions for strengthening metallurgical work at the Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences seemed too large, but he had the experience of personally seeing the establishment of research institutes in the Soviet Union, and he believed that compared with the tasks that the metallurgical research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences will undertake, he would soon feel that the estimate was still too low.
    The Soviet Academy of Sciences delegation attached great importance to experimental research in factories. If the old production relied on experience, then future production must rely on scientific data. They believed that even very small factories must have their own laboratories; otherwise, it would be difficult to produce good products because they would not know the composition of raw materials or the performance of finished products. If a factory does not have a laboratory or if it has one but it is very weak, it will be difficult for it to establish contact with other research institutions or universities. The factory laboratory is truly the door from science to practice and also a good place to train cadres. Academician Bardin quoted the words of the late great metallurgist Gnum Grzhimailo: "For engineers who have just started working, there are two doors that must be passed, one is the factory laboratory and the other is the design bureau, and there is no other way to go."
    How to carry out scientific research in Chinese universities was also a question that the Soviet Academy of Sciences delegation paid special attention to. They repeatedly emphasized the importance of doing a good job in graduation design. Universities should set aside certain manpower and material resources specifically for scientific research. Academician Kostenko also specifically put forward eight topics that he discovered during his visit that could be studied by universities. The solution of each topic requires a large amount of collective creative labor from many teachers and students and will play a certain role in national construction.
    The Soviet Academy of Sciences delegation repeatedly emphasized the importance of division of labor and cooperation in scientific research. There must be a clear division of labor between the research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, universities, and industrial departments, and at the same time, there must be close cooperation to make scientific research work an organic whole. From the formulation of plans to the conduct of research to the completion of tasks, they must always maintain close contact and cooperation with each other. The organizational center of this organic link and cooperation is the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The establishment of the four divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences will certainly be able to solve this problem.
    The Soviet Academy of Sciences delegation unanimously believed that the most important and most serious problem in the Chinese scientific community at present is the cadre problem. Although Chinese science has a long and glorious history, it has stagnated in the stage of feudal society for a long time. In the past hundred years, due to imperialist aggression, China has not formed its own schools and traditions in modern science. Therefore, in the early days after the victory of the revolution, the phenomenon of extreme lack of scientific cadres was manifested. The training and growth of scientific cadres is much more difficult and slower than that of technical cadres, because there are very few fixed or repetitive working methods in scientific research. What is needed here is the greatest initiative and creative effort.
    The Party and the government's policy of uniting scientists is completely correct. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has also made the training of new forces its long-term central task, but they believe that the specific measures taken so far are not enough. In addition to selecting a considerable number of the most outstanding university graduates to do scientific research work every year and formulating training and promotion methods for existing young scientific personnel, the most promising young scientific personnel should be sent in a planned and large-scale manner to the Academy of Sciences research institutes in the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries to study, and scientists from the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries should be invited to China to participate in and help with the work of the various research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In order to give senior researchers the opportunity to study, they should be sent to the Soviet Union or other People's Democratic countries for short-term inspections or internships every year as needed by their work.
    The above is only a part of the many valuable opinions and suggestions put forward by the Soviet Academy of Sciences delegation. After preliminary research on these many valuable opinions and suggestions, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has incorporated all the suggestions that should be implemented in the coming years into the Academy's Five-Year Plan. The long-term scientific suggestions will be organized by Chinese scientists to study and discuss when formulating the long-term plan for the development of Chinese science this year, and a plan will be formulated and implemented step by step. In the implementation of these many suggestions and opinions, there are still many aspects that must be guided and assisted by the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Soviet scientists. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has made resolutions and taken organizational measures on many major issues concerning the further development of contacts and cooperation between the two academies, such as exchanging scientific work experience, conducting cooperative research, exchanging visiting experts, and exchanging graduate students, and will implement them one by one starting in the second half of this year.
    The achievements of the Soviet Academy of Sciences delegation during their short two-month visit were very significant. Their series of scientific activities strengthened the enthusiasm and determination of Chinese scientific workers to serve national construction. Their series of suggestions on China's construction will help China's socialist construction better develop and complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Their many suggestions on China's scientific undertakings will leave an indelible mark in the history of Chinese science.

    深厚的友谊，宝贵的建议
    ——感谢苏联科学院代表团给我们的帮助
    中国科学院技术科学学部主任　严济慈
    今年四月底以苏联科学院副院长伊·普·巴尔金院士为首的苏联科学院代表团来我国访问，作为陪同人员之一，我很荣幸地同苏联科学院代表团特别是同巴尔金、柯斯琴科两位院士有比较多的接触。他们那种高度的马克思列宁主义思想原则、渊博的学识、忘我的劳动热情以及诚挚友爱的国际主义精神，在我们每个人的脑海中，留下了永远不可磨灭的印象。
    加快工业化的速度首先要采用世界上最先进的技术，在增加产量和品种的同时要不断提高质量和降低成本。巴尔金院士指出，在我国目前钢铁产量还小而又没有很多废钢的情况下，发展钢铁工业最迅速的途径是采用转炉炼钢。转炉炼钢的最大优点是建厂快、投资小、产率高、成本低。一座二十吨的转炉，由于它每半小时就可出钢一次，每天可以和一座二百吨的平炉生产一样多的钢。由于近几年来采用吹氧操作和真空处理等新技术后，转炉钢的质量和平炉钢没有什么差别了。可以说转炉炼钢经过了技术革命，它已由一度被人遗弃的地位而复活起来，并且具有远大的发展前途。因此，在我国新钢铁基地的设计中，应该考虑大量采用新型转炉炼钢的措施。这是一项关系中国钢铁工业发展的重要技术政策。
    巴尔金院士一再强调使用氧气炼钢的优越性。这种新技术的应用，不限于转炉，即在平炉和电炉上应用，也可以改善钢的质量，缩短冶炼时间，提高生产率百分之十五至二十。至于大量氧气的供应问题，由于苏联物理学家卡彼查院士的巨大成就，已经创造了一种效率极高、操作简单的氧气制造机。苏联的崭新科学成就对共产主义建设的贡献是巨大的，我们应该加紧学习，加强我们已经开始的使用氧气炼钢的试验工作，来推动钢铁工业更好更快地发展。
    不断地采用先进技术来改进现有设备的效能，充分发挥既有企业的潜在能力，是社会主义建设的原则之一。巴尔金院士在访问我国若干小型钢厂之后，认为这些小型钢厂的出现和存在并非偶然，而是同地区需要有密切关联的，如能在技术上加以提高改进，充分发挥其能力，对加速我国的社会主义工业化将有一定的作用。根据苏联建设的经验，巴尔金院士判断这些钢厂至少还可以使用二十五年，因之对待它们的政策不能是听任自流，而是应该积极用先进的技术来装备它们、改造它们，使之更好地为社会主义建设服务。提高小型钢厂到现代化水平的重要措施之一，是使用铸锭机来进行连续或半连续铸锭。使用新型的铸锭机，可以大大减轻铸锭工段的繁重劳动，可以免除目前用下注法所产生的耐火材料消耗和减少钢锭中夹杂物的形成，还可以提高生产率。铸造这种小型钢锭正是小型钢厂的任务，而它们所生产的小型钢锭也正是建设上大量需要的产品。这样明确地规定任务，也就更能发挥现有企业的作用。
    列宁曾经说过：“共产主义是苏维埃政权加上全国电气化。”电气化的基础是电机制造工业，电机制造工业的水平决定着一个国家电气化的程度。因此必须努力发展电机制造工业以满足社会主义工业化和国家电气化的需要。柯斯琴科院士在我国各地访问后，认为就我国目前电机制造的条件看来，有足够的可能来很快地发展。但是潜在力量没有充分发挥，这表现在单机容量小，生产总值低，生产计划保守。生产的专门化可以大大提高生产速度。各个电机制造厂之间应当有很好的分工，甚至一个车间也应尽可能地使其专门化。这样就可加快电机制造工业的发展，以适应国家建设对于大容量的动力设备方面的要求。
    柯斯琴科院士指出：加快生产速度和扩大生产量的另一个先进方法是进行电机的系列生产。一个系列的确定要非常慎重，要经过认真的、大量的理论计算和试验研究工作。因为一个系列设计一经确定下来，由于生产条件的限制，以后要再改变便是十分困难的事情。在苏联曾经有由产业部门、科学院和高等学校的专家组成电机系列化委员会，来确定各厂生产的电机系列。目前中国电机制造工业对这一问题还没有足够的重视，应该考虑作最适当的选择，采用最新的系列，派遣有经验的工程师去苏联设计部门选择我们所需要的资料并去制造工厂具体了解这些设计在制造中所应特别注意的问题。
    柯斯琴科院士还再三提醒我们及早注意中国铁路电气化的准备工作。在铁路电气化这个问题上，许多国家包括苏联在内走了一些弯路。近几年来科学工作证明用单相五十周波的交流系统比用直流更为经济，更为合理，已在法国、匈牙利等国家内得到广泛的应用。我国在开始铁路电气化的今日，就当慎重考虑，专门研究，在最先进的科学技术水平上进行建设，以加速对国民经济具有重大意义的交通运输事业的发展。
    苏联科学院代表团的同志对中国科学院、政府产业部门以及高等学校的科学研究机构发展得这样迅速，经费和设备是这样的充足，感到非常兴奋。但是他们也很诚恳地指出：中国科学的基础一般说来是薄弱的，虽有大批新生力量，而有经验的科学研究工作者比较少，各方面的工作都还远远落后于国家建设的需要。
    中国科学研究工作正在开始和成长阶段。中国科学院的研究所还没有包括应有的科学领域。今后若干年内应该建立那些研究机构和怎样建立这些研究机构，他们都提出了建议。
    中国科学院的各个研究所应该成为各个专业科学研究网的中心，在国民经济发展中起着重大的作用。就目前情况来说，中国科学院技术科学方面的各个研究所所进行的工作绝大部分还是零散的、被动的，过多地担负着对工厂进行技术支援性质的工作，因而没有力量去研究更重大的具有长远性和综合性的问题。苏联科学院代表团认为这在过去是不可避免的，但不能长期停留在这样一个阶段，应该同产业部门的研究机构有适当的分工，并协助产业部门建立它们自己的研究机构。
    对中国科学院的冶金陶瓷研究所和金属研究所，巴尔金院士指出应该开展和加强有关矿石精选、还元、烧结的研究，冶金过程中热交换、热平衡、热传导以及物料运行和气体动力学的研究，加强冶炼过程的研究，新技术所需要的各种合金如耐热合金系统、高温高压化学所需要的热稳定性合金、制造精密仪器用的合金的研究，以及有关金属焊接、金属腐蚀、金属加工、金属物理等方面的一系列问题的研究。他最后还说他对中国科学院研究所加强冶金工作的建议，好像提得太大了，但是他有着亲眼看到苏联建立研究所的经验，他认为这些建议和中国科学院冶金方面的研究所所将担负的任务比较起来，很快就会觉得还估计太低呢。
    苏联科学院代表团十分重视工厂中的试验研究工作。如果说旧的生产是靠经验的话，那末今后的生产便非凭着科学数据不可。他们认为即使是很小的工厂，也必须有它自己的试验室，否则既不知道原料的成分，又不知道成品的性能，很难生产出好的东西来。工厂如果没有实验室或虽有而很薄弱的话，它也就很难同其它研究机构或高等学校建立联系。工厂的实验室实在是科学通往实践的大门，同时也是一个很好的培养干部的地方。巴尔金院士引用已故的伟大的冶金学家格努姆·格尔日马依洛的话说：“对于刚开始工作的工程师有两道门必须通过，一道是工厂实验室，另一道是设计局，没有其它的路可走。”
    如何在我国高等学校中开展科学研究工作，也是苏联科学院代表团特别注意的一个问题。他们一再强调目前做好毕业设计工作的重要性。高等学校应该留出一定的人力和物力专供科学研究之用。柯斯琴科院士还给我们具体提出了在他此次访问中所发现的可供高等学校研究的八个题目。每个题目的解决，需要众多师生大量的、集体的创造性劳动，都将对国家建设起着一定的作用。
    苏联科学院代表团一再强调科学研究工作中分工合作的重要性。中国科学院和高等学校产业部门的研究所之间必须有明确的分工，同时应有密切的配合，使科学研究工作成为一个有机的整体。从制定计划，进行研究，一直到完成任务的过程中，都必须彼此经常密切联系和配合。这一有机联系和配合的组织中心就是中国科学院。中国科学院四个学部的成立一定能够解决这个问题。
    苏联科学院代表团一致认为中国科学界目前最主要也最严重的问题是干部问题。中国科学尽管有长远的辉煌的历史，但由于长期停滞于封建社会的阶段，近百年来更由于帝国主义的侵略，在近代科学上中国没有形成自己的学派和自己的传统，因而在革命胜利后的最初日子里就表现出科学干部极端缺乏的现象。科学干部的培养和成长，比技术干部还要困难得多，慢得多，因为在科学研究工作中很少有某种定型的或带重复性的工作方式，在这里需要最大的主动性和创造性的努力。
    党和政府团结科学家的政策是完全正确的。中国科学院也已把培养新生力量作为自己的长期的中心任务，但是他们认为到目前为止所采取的具体措施还很不够。除每年选拔相当数量的最优秀的大学毕业生去作科学研究工作并对现有青年科学人员订出培养和晋级办法外，要有计划地、大量地派遣青年科学人员中最有培养前途的去苏联和其他人民民主国家的科学院研究所学习，并邀请苏联和其他人民民主国家的科学家到中国参加和帮助中国科学院各研究所的工作。为了使高级研究人员有进修的机会，每年根据工作上的需要，应适当地派到苏联或其他人民民主国家进行短期考察或实习。
    上面谈到的只是苏联科学院代表团所提出的许多宝贵的意见和建议的一部分。对这许多宝贵的意见和建议，中国科学院经过初步研究，已将近年内应该进行贯彻实施的建议，全部订入科学院五年计划内；对那些带长远性的科学建议，将在今年制定中国科学发展远景规划时组织中国科学家来学习讨论，拟出方案，有步骤地加以贯彻。在实现这许多建议和意见中，还有不少方面必须得到苏联科学院和苏联科学家的指导和帮助，中国科学院已就进一步发展两国科学院之间的联系和合作的许多重大问题，如交流科学工作经验、进行合作研究、互派考察专家、互派研究生等问题，作出决议，采取组织措施，自今年下半年起逐项贯彻实施。
    苏联科学院代表团在短短两个月访问期内的成就是十分显著的。他们一系列的科学活动，加强了中国科学工作者为国家建设服务的热情和决心；他们对中国建设事业的一系列建议，将帮助我国社会主义建设事业更好地开展和第一个五年计划的提前完成；他们对中国科学事业的许多建议，更将在中国科学史上留下不可磨灭的劳迹。
