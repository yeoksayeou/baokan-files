The geological personnel searching for oil in the Qaidam Basin are continuously reporting good news about the discovery of new oil-bearing structures. In areas where oil-bearing structures were discovered last year, more oil seeps and ozokerite outcrops are being found than last year. Geological personnel are conducting detailed explorations of the shape and underground conditions of these oil-bearing structures. In addition, the continuous discovery of coal and water needed for exploration work and the lives of the staff has created conditions for further exploration of the underground resources of the Qaidam Basin.

The increasing hope for oil reserves in the Qaidam Basin encourages the work enthusiasm of every geological worker. They work selflessly from dawn to dusk every day. When they lost their way back to the team, they camped out in the deep gullies and deserts, continuing their work the next day. In order to find oil-bearing structures, the route survey team bravely crossed a 300-kilometer waterless Gobi desert and traversed the swamp area in the middle of the basin, marching day and night. The gravity and magnetic survey team had to work on routes tens of kilometers long every day. In places where cars could not pass, in addition to relying on donkeys for transportation, they also carried instruments weighing dozens of kilograms on foot. Due to the large number of novices in the 11th Topographic Survey Group of Team 404, they often failed to meet the quota in the early stage of work. Under the earnest leadership of the female leader, Tang Mengxia, they summarized their experience every day. A month later, they not only guaranteed the completion of the quota, but sometimes even exceeded it. The drilling team created new records for rapid installation and rapid safe drilling under poor working conditions, and the core recovery rate has also improved.

In order to accelerate exploration based on these initial achievements, another group of geological personnel has recently arrived in the Qaidam Basin. The Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau has also organized a force to open up new working areas. (Xinhua News Agency)

    青海柴达木盆地石油勘查工作获得成果
    在柴达木盆地寻找石油的地质人员那里，不断地传出找到新的储油构造的捷报。在去年已经发现储油构造的地区，露在地面上的油苗和地腊等露头也比去年发现得更多了。地质人员们正在对这批储油构造的形状和地下情况进行细致的探测。此外，勘探工作和工作人员生活所需的煤和水等也不断发现，为进一步勘查柴达木盆地的地下资源创造了条件。
    柴达木盆地越来越大的储油希望，鼓舞着每个地质人员的劳动热忱。他们每天从清晨到天黑，忘我地劳动。他们迷失了归队的方向，就在深沟戈壁上露宿，第二天继续工作。为了寻找储油构造，路线概查队曾英勇地通过长达三百公里的无水戈壁滩，穿过了横亘盆地中部的沼泽地带，日日夜夜地行进。重磁力普查队每天要在几十公里长的路线上进行工作，在汽车开不过的地方，除靠毛驴运输外，他们也抬着重达几十公斤的仪器步行。四零四队第十一地形测量组由于新手较多，在开工初期老不能完成定额，他们就在女组长汤梦霞的认真带动下天天总结经验，一个月以后，不但保证了定额的完成，有时还能超过。钻井队在工作条件较差的情况下创造了快速安装和快速安全钻进的新纪录，岩芯采取率也有提高。
    为了在这些初步获得的成果的基础上加速勘探，最近又有一批地质人员来到柴达木盆地。青海石油勘探局还组织一批力量开辟了新的工作地区。　（新华社）
