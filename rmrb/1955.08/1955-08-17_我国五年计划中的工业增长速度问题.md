    I.

    The industrial growth rate is a concentrated expression of the effects of a country's political, economic, and technological factors on industry. The speed of industrial growth signifies the merits of the social system and economic prosperity or recession. To understand the scale of China's Five-Year Plan and the production levels it will achieve, we must study China's industrial growth rate.

    China's First Five-Year Plan stipulates that by 1957, the total value of national industrial output will increase by 98.3% compared to 1952. In other words, it must grow by an average of 14.7% each year for five years. Is this a very high speed? Can it be achieved? What are the contents and composition of this speed? These are all issues of concern.

    For a country to achieve an average annual industrial growth rate of 14.7% during a five-year period in the process of industrialization means that its total industrial output will nearly double in five years. It should be said that the country's industry is advancing at a high speed. Such a speed does not exist in capitalist countries.

    Take the United States as an example. The annual growth rate of its total industrial output was 8.2% in the five years from 1890 to 1895, 5.2% in the five years from 1895 to 1900, 2.6% in the five years from 1900 to 1905, and 3.6% in the five years from 1905 to 1910. In the subsequent period, from 1929 to 1951, the United States' industrial production only doubled in twenty-two years. Britain only increased by 60%, and France only increased by 4%.

    From this, it can be seen that the industrial growth rate specified in China's First Five-Year Plan is very high. This can not only be seen from the above comparison but can also be further proven from the following points: (A) China's Five-Year Plan stipulates that the average annual growth rate of all industries is 14.7%, of which the production of means of production increases by an average of 17.8% each year. The production of means of production progresses at such a high speed, which shows that China's industrial growth has its advantages. (B) The average annual rate of 14.7% includes both large-scale and small-scale industries [Note 1]. Among them, the average annual speed of large-scale industry is 15.7%, and the growth rate of large-scale industry often represents the industrial development of a country. (C) China has various economic components during the transition period, and the average annual growth rate of 14.7% in the Five-Year Plan is a comprehensive indicator of the industrial growth rate of various economic types, among which the average annual growth rate of state-owned industries (including central and local state-owned) with socialist characteristics is 18.1%. This shows that China's industrialization has a distinct socialist nature.

    In this light, isn't it obvious that the industrial development targets stipulated in China's Five-Year Plan are active and high-speed?

    Some people say that during China's economic recovery period (1949-1952), the average annual industrial growth rate was 36.9%, while the industrial growth rate stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan is only 14.7% per year on average. Isn't this very slow? Regarding this issue, we should recognize that the recovery of old enterprises is relatively easy, while the construction of new enterprises and the use of new technologies are more difficult, and the base number of industrial output value increases year by year. Therefore, it is natural that the speed of industrial production growth during the construction period is slower than during the recovery period. According to the experience of many countries, especially the Soviet Union, we cannot and should not expect to maintain the speed of the recovery period during the construction period, because the conditions and content have changed. After the country enters the construction period, an average annual growth rate of 14.7% in industrial production should be considered very high. We only need five years to surpass the decades of China's reactionary rule era. Is such an industrial growth rate slow?

    Then, can the industrial growth rate stipulated in the Five-Year Plan be completed? Judging from the actual situation of the first two years of the Five-Year Plan and the prospects for the next three years, from the balance of production, supply, and sales of major products, and from the progress of putting newly built and rebuilt factories and mines into production, the speed stipulated in the Five-Year Plan can be completed. This is because: (A) The actual total industrial output value of the country in 1954 has increased by 53.7% compared to 1952, calculated at constant prices. In this way, the industrial production's Five-Year Plan can be completed on schedule as long as the rate increases by an average of 8.9% per year for the next three years. (B) Many major products that have been balanced have greatly increased in five years. When balancing, the possible difficulties that may occur under normal circumstances, such as insufficient raw materials, limited market demand, and the inability of production capacity or technical strength to keep up, have been estimated. (C) There are fewer newly built and rebuilt factories and mines above the limited quota that can be put into production in the first two years of the Five-Year Plan and more in the last three years, and many of the newly built factories and mines that have been put into production in the first two years will not be able to fully utilize their production capacity until the later years.

    In addition, many other factors will affect the industrial growth rate, such as the strengthening of planning, the transformation of many private enterprises into joint state-private enterprises, and the improvement of technical levels, all of which will be conducive to the further increase in the industrial growth rate. Therefore, as long as all employees and the people of the country work together, overcome various difficulties, and defeat the sabotage of counter-revolutionaries, we can complete or overfulfill the production tasks stipulated in the Five-Year Plan.

    Is it possible to stipulate a higher industrial growth rate in the Five-Year Plan? Regarding this issue, we believe that setting it too high is not appropriate. The industrial growth rate must be based on the balance of production, supply, and sales. Currently, due to the many variable factors in China's industrial production, such as the quality of agricultural harvests and whether the supply of imported raw materials and equipment is timely, it is difficult to be completely certain in advance. If the plan is set too high, it will affect or lose its reliability. However, this only applies to the five-year long-term plan. As for the formulation and implementation of the annual plan, it is different. We should actively strive to increase China's industrial growth rate on the basis of the balance of production, supply, and sales, according to the specific circumstances of the year.

    II.

    The Five-Year Plan stipulates that the production of means of production in China's industry will increase by an average of 17.8% per year, and the production of consumer goods will increase by an average of 12.4% per year. Are these indicators appropriate? Does it reflect the requirements of socialist industrialization? Does it take into account the improvement of people's lives?

    According to the Marxist theory of reproduction, in the process of socialist construction, to determine the production of the two major categories, the production of means of production must be given priority. Only in this way can we continuously improve the technical level and expand reproduction, gradually improve the people's material and cultural living standards, and further consolidate national defense. According to China's actual situation, giving priority to the development of the production of means of production is of particularly important significance. The industrial base of old China was extremely weak, especially the underdevelopment of heavy industry. After the recovery period, by 1952, the output of many major products in the country had reached and exceeded the highest pre-war level. However, the proportion of the production of means of production in the total industrial output value was only 39.7%, while the proportion of the production of consumer goods was 60.3%. Therefore, vigorously developing the production of means of production reflects the requirements of socialist industrialization and conforms to the long-term interests of the people of the country.

    On the other hand, does the industrial production part of the Five-Year Plan consider continuously improving the degree to which the needs of the people's lives are met? The answer is yes. From the perspective of the output of consumer goods produced by industry in the Five-Year Plan, taking into account the annual increase in the population, by 1957, the per capita output of major daily necessities such as cotton cloth, knitwear, woolen fabrics, raw salt, sugar, edible vegetable oil, cigarettes, matches, rubber shoes, paper, and bicycles will increase to varying degrees compared to 1952. And the total output value of consumer goods produced by industry will increase by about 80% compared to 1952. The production of consumer goods in industry is developing at such a high speed, obviously to take into account the improvement of the people's living standards.

    In the industrial production part of the Five-Year Plan, is there appropriate consideration for the needs of farmers in production and life? It should be said that the Five-Year Plan tries as much as possible to take into account the needs of farmers for means of production and means of subsistence. We can prove this from the production plans of some industrial products needed by farmers.

    | Industrial Product Name | 1952 Output | 1957 Output Plan | 1957 as a % of 1952 |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | Double-wheeled moldboard plow | 0.05 million units | 68.9 million units | 13,620 |
    | Ammonium sulfate (chemical fertilizer) | 0.181 million tons | 0.504 million tons | 278 |
    | Ammonium nitrate (chemical fertilizer) | 7,486 tons | 44,000 tons | 588 |
    | Cotton cloth | 2,163.4 million bolts | 16,372.1 million bolts | 147 |
    | Edible vegetable oil [Note 2] | 0.724 million tons | 1.552 million tons | 214 |
    | Rubber shoes | 61.69 million pairs | 108.31 million pairs | 176 |
    | Salt [Note 3] | 3.46 million tons | 5.932 million tons | 171 |
    | Matches | 0.92 million cases | 1.270 million cases | 139 |

    From the output plan of the above industrial products, it can be seen that agricultural tools and fertilizers, which play a significant role in improving agricultural production, will increase greatly within five years, and some daily necessities frequently needed by farmers will also increase rapidly. If the chemical fertilizer factories, tractor factories, new-style agricultural tool factories, and daily necessities factories under construction are put into production in the future, the means of production and means of subsistence needed by farmers will increase even more. It can be seen that the state has tried its best to take into account the needs of the vast number of farmers in its plan to develop industrial production.

    When studying the Five-Year Plan, how should we assess whether the production targets of the two major categories are appropriate? This mainly depends on whether the growth of the production of means of production is adapted to the speed of national construction; whether the growth of the production of consumer goods is adapted to the increase in people's purchasing power. Now let's look at these aspects.

    From the perspective of the growth rate (expressed as a percentage) of the production of means of production, although it is smaller than the growth rate of investment in capital construction, if we look at the increase in the production of means of production (expressed in absolute figures), it is greater than the increase in investment in capital construction. This is very natural. Because there is some duplication in the total output value of means of production, and although the means of production are mainly used for national construction, some of them are also used for daily consumption (for example, some steel is used to make daily necessities, and some coal is used for cooking and heating). Therefore, the increase in the total output value of means of production should be greater than the increase in investment. On the other hand, investment in capital construction is not entirely used to purchase means of production, because some of it is spent on wages and survey and design costs. At the same time, a large number of industrial equipment and construction materials are imported from abroad in five years. Therefore, although the growth rate of the total output value of means of production is lower than the growth rate of investment in capital construction, if we consider the above factors at the same time, we should believe that the speed of the production of means of production is basically adapted to the speed of national construction. The balance of production, supply, and sales of major products in the production of means of production can also prove this.

    The Five-Year Plan stipulates that the national power generation in 1957 will be 15.9 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 1.2 times compared to 1952, with an average annual growth rate of 17%. Compared with the national industrial growth rate, it can be seen that they are adapted to each other. It can generally meet the needs of industrial production, capital construction projects, urban lighting, and other needs. Generally speaking, the speed of electricity industry production should be greater than the growth rate of all industries. Judging from the experience of the Soviet Union's several five-year plans and the results of the implementation of China's Five-Year Plan in the first two years, it can be considered that the ratio of the growth rate of the power industry to the growth rate of all industries stipulated in China's Five-Year Plan is appropriate.

    The Five-Year Plan stipulates that the machine manufacturing industry will grow by an average of 19.9% per year, which is higher than the growth rate of all industries and also higher than the growth rate of all means of production. This is in line with normal laws. According to Lenin's analysis and the experience of the Soviet Union, the growth rate of the machine manufacturing industry should exceed the speed of general means of production. From China's Five-Year Plan, it basically reflects this law. However, because most of China's existing machine industry is repair and assembly factories with low technical levels, most of the newly built or rebuilt machine factories will not be completed until the end of the Five-Year Plan or later, and the improvement of the technical level of existing factories requires a process. Therefore, many of the machines and equipment needed for construction must be imported, and some of the products that can be manufactured are limited due to the small variety and limited sales. Therefore, the growth rate of the machine manufacturing industry is not much higher than that of general means of production. This requires us to vigorously improve the technical level of the machine industry, earnestly strengthen the trial production and production of new products, and strive to increase the variety and improve the quality, thereby accelerating the development of the machine manufacturing industry. However, it should be stated that the average annual growth rate of 19.9% stipulated in the Five-Year Plan for the machine manufacturing industry means that 1957 will increase by about one and a half times compared to 1952, and this speed is also very high.

    Looking at the growth of consumer goods production and the growth of people's purchasing power, the ratio of the increase in social purchasing power in the last year of the Five-Year Plan (1957) compared with the year before the plan period (1952) is similar to the ratio of the increase in industrial consumer goods production in the same period. It should be pointed out that the production of consumer goods is calculated at constant prices, and there is some duplication in the total value of consumer goods production. Social purchasing power is calculated at market prices and has no duplication. Although social purchasing power is mainly used to purchase consumer goods, some of it is also used to purchase means of production, such as fertilizers, agricultural tools, etc. The part used to purchase consumer goods is not entirely used to purchase consumer goods produced by industry, because people also need agricultural products and handicrafts. But from the perspective of the growth rate of the two, it should be said that they are basically adapted to each other. The market situation in the first two years of the Five-Year Plan and the first half of this year can also prove this.

    After the production of means of production and consumer goods across the country is completed according to the above growth rate, by 1957, the proportion of means of production in China's total industrial output value will increase to 45.4%, and the proportion of consumer goods will decrease to 54.6%. Although this is a very important change, by 1957, the proportion of means of production is still lower than the proportion of consumer goods. It can be seen that striving to increase the proportion of means of production in the total industrial output value is a long-term and important task for us.

    III.

    The Five-Year Plan stipulates that by 1957, the total value of national industrial output will increase by 98.3% compared to 1952. How is so much total output value growing? Approximately how much is increased due to newly built and rebuilt factories and mines? How much is increased by the increased production of existing industrial and mining enterprises? Understanding these is beneficial to understanding the role of newly built and rebuilt factories and mines and existing enterprises in the Five-Year Plan.

    According to preliminary estimates based on plan targets, the production of newly built and major rebuilt factories and mines accounts for about 30%. That is to say, about 30% of the industrial output increased in 1957 compared to 1952 is produced by newly built and major rebuilt factories and mines put into production during the Five-Year Plan period, and nearly 70% is increased production from existing enterprises in 1952. From this analysis, we can see how important existing enterprises are in completing the Five-Year industrial production plan. The view that ignores the production work of existing enterprises, considers existing enterprises to be dilapidated, and therefore does not pay attention to them and does not strengthen management, is obviously wrong.

    But on the other hand, can we conclude from this that the newly built and rebuilt factories and mines put into production within five years are not important to the completion of the Five-Year industrial production plan? We must not recognize this. The above analysis is in terms of the entire country. If we look at state-owned industries, especially enterprises under the central industrial ministries, the total output value of newly built and rebuilt factories and mines within five years accounts for a much larger proportion. Moreover, many important products that we could not manufacture before, such as trucks, steam turbines, hydraulic turbines, etc., are all produced by newly built or major rebuilt enterprises. In terms of the national output of major products, by 1957, the proportion of the output produced by newly built and rebuilt factories and mines in the total output of many products is also very large. Therefore, striving to complete capital construction projects on schedule and put them into production plays a significant role in completing the industrial production part of the Five-Year Plan.

    It can be seen that existing enterprises, in addition to accumulating funds and cultivating technical talents for the country, must also support capital construction, agricultural production, supply the daily necessities needed by the people, and the products needed for export. Newly built and rebuilt enterprises are increasingly demonstrating their role in improving the technical level of China's industry, increasing important new types of products, and increasing the growth rate of industrial production. Therefore, the improvement of work in these two areas must be taken care of simultaneously, and neither can be neglected.

    IV.

    According to the stipulations of the Five-Year Plan, the development speed of various economic types of industry is as follows: State-owned industry increases by an average of 18.1% per year; Cooperative industry increases by an average of 22.3% per year; Joint state-private industry increases by an average of 54% per year; The comparable part of private industry will increase by 22% in 1957 compared to 1952, and if calculated on average, it will increase by about 4.1% per year.

    Among state-owned industries, central state-owned industry increases by an average of 16.2% per year; local state-owned industry increases by an average of 22.6% per year. Why is the speed of local state-owned industry much higher than that of central state-owned industry? This is because local state-owned industry has greater potential, generally takes materials locally, and the supply of raw materials is more convenient; the construction projects of central state-owned industry are mostly large-scale enterprises, and are mainly heavy industry, and the construction time required for large-scale heavy industrial factories and mines is longer. Local state-owned industry invests more in light industry, and the scale is generally smaller than that of central state-owned industry, so the construction time is shorter and the results are faster. Provinces raise more funds themselves to invest in industry, and local state-owned industry is scattered throughout the country, with a small base and easier development.

    The cooperative industry listed in the industrial production plan refers to the processing factories operated by supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives, excluding handicraft production cooperatives. It is mainly agricultural product processing industry and food industry. Its growth rate is fast for many of the same reasons as local state-owned industry. In addition, with the development of industry and agriculture and the improvement of people's lives, after the implementation of unified purchase and sales of certain products, the production tasks undertaken by cooperative industry have greatly increased.

    Joint state-private industry increases by an average of 54% per year, including the speed of production growth and the speed of socialist transformation [Note 4]. The speed of its own production growth can be divided into two parts for calculation, namely the joint state-private industry that existed in 1952 and the industry that was transformed from private to joint state-private during the Five-Year Plan period. The comparable production growth rate of these two parts is about 15% per year on average for the former and about 12% per year on average for the latter. Their development speed is much higher than that of private industry, which is due to two reasons: on the one hand, the private industries that are transformed into joint state-private in the Five-Year Plan period are mostly larger factories and mines with certain conditions; on the other hand, the change in production relations will promote the development of production, which will make the increase in output value faster.

    Although nearly half of private industry will be transformed into joint state-private industry during the Five-Year Plan period, the remaining part will still have a certain degree of growth. The aforementioned increase of 22% in private industry in 1957 compared to 1952, with an average annual increase of 4.1%, refers to the comparable growth rate of the part of private industry that has not been merged. Because the transformation of private industry into joint state-private industry is not a sudden change, but is carried out in stages year by year, coupled with reasons such as the quality of agricultural harvests, the annual speed of private industry will deviate from the above average annual growth rate.

    It can be seen that China's Five-Year Plan implements the principle of giving priority to the growth of the socialist economy, and at the same time implements the policy of overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement for industries of various economic types. In general, the changes in the proportion of production growth of various economic types reflect the socialist nature of China's industrial development.

    V.

    According to the 1953 statistical bulletin, the actual total industrial output value of the country increased by 33% compared to 1952. Why was there such a high speed in 1953? Can we draw some experiences and lessons from this?

    First of all, 1952 was a year of bumper agricultural harvests, which provided sufficient raw materials for the rapid growth of the textile industry and food industry in 1953 and expanded the market. This made it possible for the textile industry and food industry, which account for a large proportion of China's total industrial output value, to achieve smooth development, thereby affecting the growth rate of the entire industry.

    1953 was the first year that the country entered large-scale construction, and investment in capital construction grew rapidly. This affected the growth rate of various industries serving capital construction, such as the machine manufacturing industry, the steel industry, and the building materials industry, all of which had significant growth. Although some departments blindly placed orders at one time in the early stages of large-scale construction, the rapid growth of investment played a positive role in promoting the development of industrial production.

    In addition, there was some restorative production in 1953. A new situation appeared in the market after summer, and many industrial products sold well, and processing orders increased significantly. In particular, after the central government issued instructions on increasing production and practicing economy, party committees and administrative management agencies at all levels strengthened supervision, inspection, and specific guidance on industrial production, and the operation and management of factories and mines were improved, which improved the speed of production development.

    From the above analysis, we can roughly see what the ways to increase China's industrial growth rate are. From a longer-term perspective, the key to increasing speed is to do a good job in capital construction, especially industrial construction centered on 156 projects. This requires further mastery of resource conditions and strengthening of capital construction work. From the perspective of the first Five-Year Plan period, the main ways to increase production speed are: (A) Vigorously improve the technical level, especially strengthen the technical force for the design and trial production of new products, so as to rapidly increase new types of products, expand varieties, and improve quality; (B) Actively develop agricultural production, especially increase the output of cash crops such as cotton, oilseeds, hemp, tobacco leaves, and sugarcane; (C) Strive to complete capital construction projects on time as planned, and production preparation work must be done before completion, so that normal production can be carried out after a short test run; (D) Do a good job in the reorganization and transformation of private industry, and combine socialist transformation with the arrangement of organizing production; (E) Improve the planning of industrial production, carefully study social needs, do a good job in balancing production, supply, and sales and production coordination, save raw materials, study and use substitutes, earnestly promote effective advanced experience, and further improve the management level of enterprises.

    Regarding the issue of industrial growth speed, it is necessary to prevent and overcome two incorrect tendencies. These are: ignoring the speed of industrial growth and blindly pursuing speed. The former tendency underestimates the serious significance of the speed of industrial growth, and therefore does not take active and effective measures, use favorable conditions, and overcome difficulties to promote the growth of industrial production. The latter tendency does not seriously study actual needs and possibilities, and based on subjective wishes, demands an inappropriate speed. Both of these tendencies are harmful to practical work. What we usually mean by increasing the speed of industrial growth refers to taking the above measures to accelerate the development of industrial production based on actual needs and possibilities, and on the basis of balancing production, supply, and sales.

    Now that China's first Five-Year Plan has been decided, the task before the people of the country is to mobilize all forces to strive to complete or overfulfill the Five-Year Plan. Whether the Five-Year Plan is completed depends first on whether the industrial growth rate stipulated in the Five-Year Plan is completed on schedule, which is one of the main signs to identify whether the entire Five-Year Plan is completed. Therefore, each of us has the responsibility to assist and promote the development of China's industry in our own positions. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, the heroic and hardworking Chinese people will surely successfully complete this great historical task.

    [Note 1] In planning and statistical work, large and small enterprises are divided as follows: (1) Those with mechanical power and a total of 16 or more workers and staff are large industries, and those with 15 or less are small industries; those without mechanical power and a total of 31 or more workers and staff are large industries, and those with 30 or less are small industries. (2) All independent power plants with a capacity of 15 kilowatts or more are considered large industries regardless of the number of people.

    [Notes 2, 3] Edible vegetable oil and salt do not include the output produced by individual handicrafts and cooperative handicrafts.

    [Note 4] That is to say, part of the total output value of joint state-private industry in 1957 came from increased production, and another part came from the transformation of private industry.

    我国五年计划中的工业增长速度问题
    余建亭
    一
    工业增长速度是一个国家政治、经济、技术等因素在工业方面发生作用的集中表现。工业增长速度的快慢，意味着社会制度的优劣和经济的繁荣或萧条。我们要了解我国五年计划的规模和将要达到的生产水平等等，就必须研究我国的工业增长速度。
    我国第一个五年计划规定：到一九五七年，全国工业总产值将比一九五二年增长百分之九十八点三，也就是说，五年内平均每年要增长百分之十四点七。这是不是很高的速度呢？它是否能够完成呢？这个速度的内容和构成是怎样的呢？这些都是大家所关心的问题。
    一个国家在实现工业化的过程中，它的工业发展速度在五年期内平均每年能增长百分之十四点七，这就是说在五年内工业总产值的增长将近一倍。应该说这个国家的工业是以高速度向前推进的。这样的速度在资本主义国家是没有的。
    就拿美国来说吧，它的全部工业产值每年增长的数字，在一八九○年至一八九五年的五年内为百分之八点二，在一八九五年至一九○○年的五年内为百分之五点二，在一九○○年至一九○五年的五年内为百分之二点六，在一九○五年至一九一○年的五年内为百分之三点六。在这以后的年代中，从一九二九年至一九五一年的二十二年间，美国工业生产量一共仅增加了一倍；英国只增长百分之六十；而法国仅增长了百分之四。
    由此可见，我国第一个五年计划中所规定的工业增长速度是很高的。这不仅从上述比较中可以看得出来，而且从下面几点可以获得进一步的证明：（甲）我国五年计划规定全部工业的增长速度平均每年为百分之十四点七，其中生产资料的生产平均每年增长百分之十七点八。生产资料的生产以这样高的速度进展，这说明我国工业增长具有它的优越性。（乙）平均每年百分之十四点七的速度，是包括大型工业和小型工业〔注一〕在内的。其中大型工业的速度平均每年为百分之十五点七，而大型工业的增长速度常常是代表一个国家的工业发展状况。（丙）我国在过渡时期存在着多种经济成份，五年期内平均每年增长百分之十四点七，是各种经济类型的工业增长速度的综合指标，其中社会主义性质的国营工业（包括中央国营与地方国营），则平均每年增长速度为百分之十八点一。这说明我国的工业化具有鲜明的社会主义性质。
    这样看来，我国五年计划中所规定的工业发展指标是积极的，也是高速度的，这难道还不明显吗？
    有人说，我国在经济恢复时期（一九四九——一九五二）中，平均每年工业增长速度为百分之三十六点九，而第一个五年计划中规定的工业增长速度平均每年却是百分之一十四点七，这岂不是很慢吗？对于这个问题，我们应该认识，旧企业生产的恢复是比较容易的，新企业的建设和新技术的利用却比较困难，而工业产值的基数又一年一年地增加。因此，建设时期工业生产增长的速度较之恢复时期慢，这是很自然的。根据许多国家尤其是苏联的经验来看，我们不能够也不应该期望在建设时期保持恢复时期的速度，因为条件和内容都变了，在国家进入建设时期以后，工业生产方面平均每年的增长率能够达到百分之十四点七，这个速度应该认为是很高的。我们仅仅用五年时间，就赶过中国反动统治时代的几十年，这样的工业增长速度难道还慢吗？
    那末，五年计划中所规定的工业增长速度是否能够完成呢？从五年计划前两年的实际情况和后三年的展望看来，从主要产品产、供、销平衡情况看来，以及从新建、改建厂矿投入生产进度看来，五年计划中所规定的速度是可以完成的。这是因为：（甲）一九五四年全国工业的实际总产值按不变价格计算较一九五二年已增长百分之五十三点七，这样后三年只要平均每年能递增百分之八点九，就可以按期完成工业生产的五年计划。（乙）经过平衡计算的许多种主要产品，五年内有很大增长，在平衡时已经将通常情况下可能发生的困难，例如：某些原材料不足、市场需要量有限、生产能力或技术力量跟不上等因素，都已估计进去。（丙）五年内能够投入生产的限额以上的新建、改建厂矿前两年较少，后三年较多，而且前两年已经投入生产的新建厂矿，有许多要到后几年才能充分发挥生产能力。
    此外，还有其他许多因素将会影响工业的增长速度，例如：计划性的加强、许多私营企业变为公私合营企业、技术水平的提高等等，都将有利于工业增长速度的进一步增长，因此，只要全体职工和全国人民一致努力，克服各种困难和击破反革命分子的破坏，我们就可以完成或超额完成五年计划中所规定的生产任务。
    是否可以将五年计划中的工业增长速度规定得更高一些呢？对于这个问题，我们认为定得过高是不适合的。工业增长速度必须建立在产、供、销平衡的基础上，当前由于我国工业生产方面的可变因素还很多，例如农业收成的好坏、进口原料和设备的供应是否及时等等，事先是难以完全肯定的。计划定得过高，就会影响或失去它的可靠性。但这仅是就五年的远景计划来说的，至于年度计划的编制和执行，那就有所不同了，我们应该根据年度的具体情况在产、供、销平衡的基础上积极争取提高我国工业的增长速度。

    五年计划规定：我国工业中生产资料的生产部分平均每年递增百分之十七点八，消费资料的生产部分平均每年递增百分之十二点四。这些指标的规定是否适当呢？它是否反映了社会主义工业化的要求呢？它是否照顾了人民生活的改善呢？
    按照马克思主义再生产的理论来说，在社会主义建设过程中，要确定两大部类的生产，就必须使生产资料的生产优先增长。因为只有这样，才能不断提高技术水平和扩大再生产，才能逐步提高人民的物质和文化生活水平，才能进一步巩固国防。按照我国实际情况来看，优先发展生产资料的生产，更有其特殊重要的意义。旧中国的工业基础极薄弱，特别是重工业不发达。经过恢复时期以后，到一九五二年，全国许多主要产品的产量已达到并超过战前最高水平。但在工业总产值中，生产资料生产的部分所占比重仅百分之三十九点七，而消费资料生产的部分的比重占百分之六十点三。因此，大力发展生产资料的生产，是反映社会主义工业化的要求，符合全国人民的长远利益的。
    另一方面，五年计划中的工业生产部分，是否考虑了不断提高满足人民生活需要的程度呢？回答是肯定的。从五年计划中工业所出产的消费资料的产量来看，估计到人口逐年增加的情况，则到一九五七年，棉布、针织品、毛织品、原盐、糖、食用植物油、卷烟、火柴、胶鞋、纸、自行车等主要日用品，按人口平均计算的产量较一九五二年都有不同程度的增长。而工业所出产的消费资料的总产值较一九五二年则共增长百分之八十左右。工业中的消费资料的生产以这样快的速度向前发展，显然是为了照顾人民生活水平的提高。
    在五年计划的工业生产部分中，对于农民生产上和生活上的需要是否有适当照顾呢？应该说，五年计划是尽可能地照顾到农民对生产资料和生活资料的需要的。我们从农民所需要的一些工业品的生产计划来看，就可以证明这一点。
    工业品名称      一九五二年一九五七年产量计划   一九五七年为一九五二年的％
    双轮带铧犁　○·五万具　六八·九万具
  　一三、六二硫酸铵（化学肥料）　一八·一万吨　五○·四万吨
  　二七八硝酸铵（化学肥料）七、四八六吨　四四、○○○吨
  　五八八棉布二、一六三·四万匹　一六、三七二·一万匹
  　一四七食用植物油〔注二〕七二·四万吨　一五五·二万吨
  　二一四胶鞋六、一六九万双　一○、八三一万双　一七六盐
    〔注三〕三四六万吨　五九三·二万吨　一七一
            火柴　九二万件　一、二七○万件　一三九
    从上述工业品的产量计划可以看到，对提高农业生产有很大作用的农具，肥料等五年内有极大的增长，农民经常需要的一些日用品，增长也是很快的。如果建设中的化学肥料工厂，拖拉机工厂，新式农具厂和日用品工厂将来投入生产以后，农民所需要的生产资料和生活资料还会有更大的增长。由此可见，国家在发展工业生产的计划中是尽可能照顾广大农民的需要的。
    在研究五年计划时，要判断两大部类的生产指标规定得是否适当，应该怎样来考核呢？这主要是看生产资料生产的增长和国家建设的速度是否相适应；消费资料生产的增长和人民购买力的提高是否相适应。现在就让我们从这些方面来看看吧。
    从生产资料生产的增长速度（以百分比表示）来看，虽然小于基本建设投资的增长速度，但如果从生产资料生产的增长额（以绝对数字表示）来看，却大于基本建设投资的增长额。这是很自然的。因为生产资料的总产值中有些重复，而且生产资料虽然主要用于国家建设，但也有一部分用于日常消费（例如有些钢铁用来作日用品，有些煤用来煮饭、烤火等），因此生产资料总产值的增长额是应该大于投资的增长额。另一方面，基本建设投资也并非全部用于购置生产资料，因为有一部分是作为工资和勘察、设计等费用而支出的，同时，五年内有大量工业设备和建筑器材从国外进口，因此生产资料总产值的增长速度虽较基本建设投资的增长速度低一些，但如果和上述各因素同时考虑，我们就应该认为，生产资料生产的速度和国家建设的速度基本上是相适应的。生产资料中的主要产品的产、供、销平衡情况，也可以证明这一点。
    五年计划规定一九五七年全国发电量为一五九亿度，较一九五二年增长一点二倍，平均每年的增长率为百分之十七。和全国工业增长速度对照起来，就可以看到它们是相适应的。大体上可以满足工业生产、基本建设工程、城市照明及其他需要。一般说来，电力工业生产的速度应该大于全部工业的增长速度。从苏联几个五年计划的经验看来，从我国五年计划前两年执行结果看来，可以认为我国五年计划中所规定的电力工业和全部工业增长速度的比例关系是适当的。
    五年计划规定机械制造工业平均每年增长百分之十九点九，高于全部工业的增长速度，也高于全部生产资料生产的速度。这是合乎正常规律的。根据列宁的分析和苏联的经验，机械制造业的增长速度应超过一般生产资料的速度。从我国五年计划看来，大体上是反映了这一规律。但由于我国旧有机械工业多系修配性的工厂，技术水平不高，新建或改建的机械工厂大部分要到五年计划期末或以后才能建成，现有工厂技术水平的提高需要一个过程，因此建设中所需要的机器设备有许多必须进口，而能够制造的产品有些由于品种少、销路受到限制，因而机器制造工业的增长速度较一般生产资料高得不多。这就需要我们大力提高机械工业的技术水平，切实加强新产品的试制和生产，力求增加品种，提高质量，从而加速机器制造业的发展。但应当说明，五年计划中所规定的机器制造工业的生产平均每年增长百分之十九点九，这就是说，一九五七年较一九五二年增长约一倍半，这个速度也是很高的。
    再从消费资料生产的增长和人民购买力的增长情况来看，五年计划期末一年（一九五七年）社会购买力较计划期前一年（一九五二年）增长的比例和同一时期工业消费资料生产增长的比例相近似。应该指出消费资料的生产是以不变价格计算的，消费资料生产总值中有一部分重复。而社会购买力是按市场价格计算，没有重复部分。但社会购买力虽然主要是购买消费品，也有一部分是用来购买生产资料，例如：肥料、农具等等。用来购买消费品的那一部分也不是全部用来购买工业所出产的消费资料，因为人民还需要农产品和手工业品。但从两者的增长速度来看，应该说大体上是相适应的。五年计划前两年和今年上半年的市场情况也可以证明这一点。
    全国生产资料和消费资料的生产按照上述增长速度完成以后，到一九五七年，我国工业总产值中生产资料所占比重将提高到百分之四十五点四，消费资料的比重将下降到五十四点六。这虽是一个很重要的变化，但是到一九五七年，生产资料生产的比重仍然低于消费资料生产的比重，可见努力提高生产资料在工业总产值中的比重，是我们长期而重要的任务。三
    五年计划规定，到一九五七年，全国工业总产值较一九五二年增长百分之九十八点三。这样多的生产总值是怎样增长的呢？大概有多少是由于新建改建厂矿而增加的呢？有多少是由于原有的工矿企业而增产的呢？了解这些，对认识新建、改建厂矿和原有企业在五年计划中的作用是有益处的。
    按照计划指标初步估算，由新建和重大改建厂矿所生产的约占百分之三十左右。这就是说，一九五七年较一九五二年增长的工业产量中约有百分之三十是五年计划期间投入生产的新建和重大改建厂矿所生产，将近百分之七十是一九五二年原有企业所增产。从这一分析中，我们可以看到，现有企业在完成五年工业生产计划方面是怎样的重要。那种忽视现有企业的生产工作，认为现有企业是破烂摊子，因而不予重视，不去加强管理的观点，显然是错误的。
    但另一方面，是否可以从这里得出结论说，五年内投入生产的新建、改建厂矿对完成五年工业生产计划，无关紧要呢？决不能这样认识。上述分析是就全国范围来说的。如果从国营工业特别是中央各工业部所属企业来看，五年内新建改建厂矿的生产总值所占比重要大得多。而且许多我们从前不能制造的重要产品例如载重汽车，汽轮机（蒸汽透平）、水轮机（水力透平）等等都是新建或重大改建企业所生产。从主要产品的全国产量来说，到一九五七年，许多产品的总产量中，新建、改建厂矿生产的数量所占的比重也是很大的。因此，争取基本建设工程按期竣工并投入生产，对完成五年计划中工业生产部分有重大作用。
    由此可见，原有企业除了为国家积累资金和培养技术人材外，还要支援基本建设、农业生产，供应人民日用品和出口所需要的产品。新建、改建企业对提高我国工业的技术水平，增加重要的新种类产品，提高工业生产的增长速度方面，则日益显示其作用。因此，对这两个方面工作的提高必须兼顾，决不可偏废。四
    按照五年计划的规定，各种经济类型的工业发展速度如下：国营工业平均每年递增百分之十八点一；合作社营工业平均每年增长百分之二十二点三；公私合营工业平均每年增长百分之五十四；私营工业的可比部分在一九五七年较一九五二年增长百分之二十二，如果按平均计算，则每年增长约百分之四点一。
    在国营工业中，中央国营工业平均每年增长百分之十六点二；地方国营工业平均每年增长百分之二十二点六。为什么地方国营工业的速度较中央国营工业还高很多呢？这是因为地方国营工业潜力较大，一般的是就地取材，原料供应较为方便；中央国营工业的建设项目多系规模巨大的企业，并以重工业为主，规模巨大的重工业厂矿所需要的建设时间较长。地方国营工业的投资用于轻工业方面较多，规模较中央国营工业一般的要小一些，因此建设时间较短，见效快。各省自筹资金投资于工业方面的较多，而且地方国营工业分散各地，基数较小，发展比较容易。
    工业生产计划中所列的合作社营工业，是指供销合作社和消费合作社所经营的加工工厂，不包括手工业生产合作社，它主要是农产品加工工业和食品工业。它的增长速度之所以快，和地方国营工业有许多相同的原因。此外，随着工农业的发展，人民生活的改善，若干产品实行统购统销以后，合作社营工业所担负的生产任务，已大大增加。
    公私合营工业平均每年增长百分之五十四，是包括生产增长的速度和社会主义改造的速度〔注四〕。而其本身的生产增长的速度，又可以划分为两部分来计算，即一九五二年原有公私合营工业，和五年计划期间由私营变为公私合营的工业。这两部分本身可比的生产增长速度，前者平均每年为百分之十五；后者平均每年为百分之十二左右。他们的发展速度较私营工业高得很多，是由于两个方面的原因，一方面是五年期内变为公私合营的私营工业多半是较大的，具备一定条件的厂矿；另一方面，生产关系的改变，将促进生产的发展，将使产值的增长较快。
    私营工业在五年计划期间，虽然有将近一半将变为公私合营，但其余一部分仍有一定程度的增长。前面所说私营工业一九五七年较一九五二年增长百分之二十二，平均每年增长百分之四点一，就是指未合营的那一部分私营工业可比的增长速度。由于私营工业变为公私合营不是一下子转变的，而是逐年分期进行的，加上农业收成好坏等原因，因此，私营工业的分年速度比上述平均每年增长速度是会有出入的。
    由此可见，我国的五年计划是贯彻了使社会主义经济优先增长的原则，同时也贯彻了对各经济类型的工业统筹兼顾，全面安排的方针的。总的说来，各经济类型生产增长的比例的变化表现着我国工业发展的社会主义性质。五
    从一九五三年统计公报看来，全国工业总产值的实际较一九五二年增长百分之三十三。为什么一九五三年会有这样高的速度呢？从这里是否可以吸取一些经验教训呢？
    首先是一九五二年农产品大丰收，为一九五三年纺织工业和食品工业的迅速增长提供了充分的原料，并扩大了市场，这样就使得在我国工业总产值中占很大比重的纺织工业和食品工业获得顺利发展的条件，从而影响整个工业的增长速度。
    一九五三年是国家进入大规模建设的第一年，基本建设投资增长得很快，这样就影响为基本建设服务的各种工业的增长速度，例如机械制造工业、钢铁工业、建筑材料工业等均有很大的增长。虽然在大规模建设初期有些部门曾经一度盲目订货，但总的说来，投资的迅速增长对工业生产的发展起着积极的推动作用。
    此外，一九五三年还有某些恢复性的生产，夏季以后市场上出现了新的局面，许多工业产品畅销，加工订货大量增加，特别是中央关于增产节约的指示发出以后，各级党委和各级行政管理机关加强了对工业生产的督促检查和具体指导，厂矿的经营管理得到改善，这样就提高了生产发展的速度。
    从上述分析中，大致可以看出提高我国工业增长速度的途径是什么。从更长远的时间来看，提高速度的关键是做好基本建设工作，特别是以一百五十六个项目为中心的工业建设。这就要求进一步掌握资源情况和加强基本建设工作。从第一个五年计划期间看来，提高生产速度的途径主要是：（甲）大力提高技术水平，尤其是壮大新产品设计和试制的技术力量，以便迅速增加新种类产品、扩大品种和提高质量；（乙）积极发展农业生产，特别是提高棉花、油料、麻、烟叶、甘蔗等经济作物的产量；（丙）努力争取基本建设工程按计划规定的时间竣工，在竣工前必须做好生产准备工作，以便经过短期试车以后，能够进行正常的生产；（丁）做好对私营工业的改组改造工作，把进行社会主义的改造同组织生产的安排结合起来；（戊）提高工业生产工作的计划性，细致地研究社会需要，做好产、供、销平衡及生产协作，节约原材料，研究和使用代用品，切实推广行之有效的先进经验，并进一步提高企业的管理水平。
    关于工业增长的速度问题，需要防止和克服两种不正确倾向。这就是：忽视工业增长的速度和盲目追求速度。前一种倾向对工业增长速度的严重意义估计不足，因而不去采取积极有效的措施，利用有利条件，克服困难来推动工业生产的增长。后一种倾向不认真研究实际的需要和可能，凭主观愿望，要求不适当的速度。这两种倾向对实际工作都是有害的。我们通常所说提高工业的增长速度都是指按实际需要和可能，在产、供、销平衡的基础上采取上述各项措施，来加速工业生产的发展的。
    现在我国第一个五年计划已经决定，摆在全国人民面前的任务就是动员一切力量争取完成或超额完成五年计划。五年计划是否完成，首先是看五年计划所规定的工业增长速度是否按期完成，它是鉴别整个五年计划是否完成的主要标志之一。因此我们每一个人都有责任在自己的岗位上来协助和推动我国工业的发展。英勇勤劳的中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，必将胜利地完成这个伟大的历史任务。
