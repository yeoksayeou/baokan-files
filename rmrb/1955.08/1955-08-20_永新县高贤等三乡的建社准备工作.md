To further develop agricultural cooperatives, the Rural Work Department of the Yongxin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangxi Province recently selected three different types of townships to conduct research on the preparatory work for establishing cooperatives. This was done to gain a clear understanding of the situation and better guide the county's work in establishing cooperatives. These three townships represent three different types in the county. Gaoxian is a first-class township, having already established three cooperatives that are running well. Gaochuan Township has only established one cooperative, and the work is average. Wenya Township has not yet established any cooperatives.

The preparatory work for establishing cooperatives in these three townships began during the spring plowing season this year. Generally, it starts from two aspects: on the one hand, selecting better mutual aid teams for cultivation and actively creating conditions for establishing cooperatives; on the other hand, conscientiously running the existing agricultural cooperatives well to influence and drive the mutual aid teams to move towards collectivization. In the preparatory work for establishing cooperatives, the demonstrative influence of the old cooperatives is significant. The four cooperatives in Gaoxian and Gaochuan, despite suffering severe floods last year, still saw increased production in two of them, and the remaining two basically maintained production, which was much better than the mutual aid teams and individual farmers. The masses generally recognized that agricultural cooperatives have "good direction, high yields, and more income." Under the education of such examples, many mutual aid teams, having personally witnessed the superiority of cooperatives, actively requested to join cooperatives, preparing favorable conditions for establishing cooperatives this year. The three townships focused on selecting nine better mutual aid teams as objects for cultivation in preparation for establishing cooperatives. Five of the nine teams were rated as first-class teams in the townships, and four were second-class teams. Local staff plan to establish cooperatives in two batches. The first batch will establish six cooperatives before autumn (three in Gaoxian, two in Gaochuan, and one in Wenya); and three more cooperatives will be established after autumn.

From the perspective of ideological preparation for establishing cooperatives, four of these nine teams planned to join cooperatives this spring. They carefully studied the cooperative charter, organized preparatory committees, and submitted "applications to join the cooperative." The other five teams also studied the cooperative charter and related materials, and some members even went to the old cooperatives to attend meetings. Whenever the cooperative resolved major issues, such as setting production plans, the heads of the mutual aid teams were often allowed to participate. Some middle-peasant members constantly inquired at the cooperative: Would joining the cooperative be disadvantageous? Could production be increased? Some townships also organized field production competitions and visits, which had greater educational significance for the teams preparing to join the cooperative. Seeing that the fields that were poorly cultivated in the past now had well-grown seedlings after joining the cooperative, the team members said with emotion: "Without agricultural cooperatives, it would be difficult for these fields to turn over." Frequent multi-faceted study and publicity have enabled many team members to understand the benefits of establishing cooperatives and the Party's collectivization policy. They are eagerly requesting the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives. According to a survey of 160 members from five teams, 84 percent voluntarily requested to establish cooperatives.

From the perspective of organizational preparation, a series of tasks have also been carried out. The Party branch first paid attention to the work of developing new Party members in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and identified fair and capable activists to cultivate as the backbone for establishing cooperatives. Four new Party members have been developed in the nine teams, and there are several more development targets. Three teams have already determined the chairman, vice-chairman, and accountant, and the rest have also determined the cultivation targets for leading backbone members. These teams have also carried out work to expand and merge teams. Five of them merged teams last winter, and three merged after the spring plowing this year. Because the preparatory work for establishing cooperatives started early, some backbone members have already established prestige among the team members. In the work of rectifying cooperatives, the local authorities also paid attention to rectifying the mutual aid teams, resolving existing problems, and purifying the organizations. For example, the Liu Yihong team in Wenya Township purged a Kuomintang element engaged in sabotage activities, further purifying and consolidating the mutual aid team.

Of the nine mutual aid teams preparing to establish cooperatives, seven are old teams with more than three years of experience. These teams are imitating agricultural cooperatives everywhere in production. Some teams have already assessed the base points for the fields. The Liu Yihong team learned the cooperative's contract labor system, achieving unified allocation of labor throughout the team, contracting fields, high labor efficiency of team members, abundant fertilizer accumulation, and better production than ordinary mutual aid teams. Cattle and farm tools have also been evaluated. In addition, each team has also checked the mutual benefit policy, ensuring timely clearing of work and settling accounts. Acceptance inspections were also conducted during the summer harvest, coupled with the actual yields previously obtained, laying the foundation for production evaluation upon joining the cooperative. Five of the nine teams have collectively purchased water buffalo and farm tools, and four teams have reclaimed wasteland, accumulating public property.

Looking at the overall situation of the preparatory work for establishing cooperatives in the three townships, it is generally good, and the enthusiasm of farmers to join cooperatives is high. However, there are still some problems. First of all, the preparatory work for establishing cooperatives has not paid enough attention to in-depth policy publicity. Some farmers still have ideological concerns such as "fear of not having enough to eat after joining the cooperative" and "fear of losing freedom." According to an analysis of the ideological situation of members from five teams, about 16 percent of members have greater doubts and do not want to join the cooperative. Some who had previously requested to establish cooperatives are also not ideologically stable, showing hesitation and wait-and-see attitudes. Hearing one or two bad things about the cooperative, they waver in their confidence in joining the cooperative, saying, "We don't know if joining the cooperative will be good or bad." Such members account for about 40 percent. In addition, in the preparatory work, there is also the shortcoming of establishing cooperatives in isolation. The work is only limited to the target teams, and there is insufficient extensive publicity of the collectivization policy and its advantages to the broader masses of farmers. It is worth noting that some staff members have overestimated the achievements of these preparatory work for establishing cooperatives, believing that it will be easy to establish cooperatives this year and that no further publicity and mobilization are needed. These situations indicate that the preparatory work for establishing cooperatives has made certain achievements, but it is still necessary to continue the work, and the enthusiasm and favorable conditions of the masses cannot replace the necessary political and organizational work in the process of establishing cooperatives.

Secondly, looking at the nine teams, the cultivation of backbone members in some teams is not enough. Three teams do not have accountants, and one team originally had a League member who could be cultivated, but some team members said: This job is very important, and we are afraid he will not do it well, and we dare not boldly cultivate him. In addition, in checking the preparatory work for establishing cooperatives in each team, we also feel the importance of overall planning and phased development. Generally, the first batch of teams establishing cooperatives are better prepared, while the leaders of the second batch of teams pay insufficient attention, and there are more problems. This needs to be paid attention to. The preparatory work for establishing cooperatives should be considered comprehensively and planned for the long term. When the first batch of mutual aid teams is preparing to establish cooperatives, the second batch of teams should not be abandoned, and a "linking" method should be adopted, taking the first step to prepare for the second step. In addition, there is an imbalance in the preparatory work, with the first-class township being better and the third-class township being worse. This should be paid attention to when allocating leadership for establishing cooperatives.

    永新县高贤等三乡的建社准备工作
    旷怡传　蓝尚
    为进一步发展农业合作社，中共江西永新县委农村工作部最近选择了三个不同类型的乡，进行建社准备工作的考查，以便做到心中有底，更好地领导全县的建社工作。这三个乡代表全县三种不同类型。高贤是一类乡，已建了三个社，办得还好；高川乡只建了一个社，工作一般；文雅乡还没有建社。
    这三个乡的建社准备工作从今年春耕的时候就已开始，一般是从两方面入手：一方面是选择较好的互助组，进行培养，积极创造办社条件。另一方面是认真办好现有的农业合作社，影响和带动互助组向合作化道路迈进。在建社准备工作中，老社的示范影响作用是很大的。高贤、高川的四个社，去年虽然遭受了严重的水灾，仍有两个社增了产，其余两个社也基本保产，比互助组、单干农民都强得多。群众普遍认识到农业合作社是“方向好、产量高、收入多”，不少互助组在这种实例教育下，亲眼看到合作社的优越性，积极要求转社，为今年建社准备了有利条件。三个乡重点选择了九个较好的互助组，作为建社培养对象。九个组中有五个是各乡评比的一等组、四个是二等组。当地工作人员计划分两批建社。第一批秋前建立六个社，（高贤三个、高川二个、文雅一个）；秋后再建立三个社。
    从建社的思想准备来看，这九个组有四个是今春就打算转社的，他们认真学习过社章，组织过筹委会，交过“入社申请书”；另外的五个组也都学习过社章和有关材料，有些组员还到老社去旁听会议。每逢社里解决较重大的问题时，如定生产计划等，经常让互助组长们参加；有些中农组员不断到社里去探问：入社会不会吃亏？能不能增产等？有些乡还组织田间生产评比参观，这些活动对准备转社的组教育意义更大。组员们看到从前耕作不好的田，入社后禾苗长得很好，感动地说：“要没有农业合作社，这田是难得翻身的。”经常的多方面的学习和宣传，使不少组员了解了办社的好处和党的合作化政策，他们迫切要求建立农业生产合作社。据五个组一百六十户成员的调查，有百分之八十四都自愿要求办社。
    从组织准备来看，也做了一系列的工作。党支部首先注意了在互助合作组织中发展新党员的工作，并物色公道能干的积极分子，培养为建社的骨干。九个组中已发展了新党员四名，还有几个发展对象。有三个组已确定了正副社长和会计，其余也都确定了领导骨干的培养对象。这些组还进行了扩组并组工作。其中五个组去冬就并了组，三个是今年春耕后合并的。由于建社准备工作开始较早，有些骨干分子在组员中已经树立起威信。在整顿合作社工作中，当地并注意对互助组也进行了整顿，解决了存在的问题，纯洁了组织。如文雅乡刘贻洪组，清除了一个有破坏活动的国民党分子，使互助组进一步得到纯洁和巩固。
    准备建社的九个互助组中，有七个是三年以上的老组。这些组在生产中处处模仿着农业合作社，有些组的田已评定了底分，刘贻洪组学习合作社的包工制，做到了全组劳力统一调配，田亩包工，组员劳动效率高、积肥多、生产比一般互助组要好。耕牛、农具也评了价。另外，各组还检查了互利政策，做到按时清工结账，夏收中还进行了验收，加上以前掌握的实际产量，为入社评产打下了基础。九组中还有五组集体添买了黄牛、农具，有四个组开了荒，积累了公共财产。
    从三个乡建社准备工作总的情况来看，一般是较好的，农民入社情绪是高涨的。但是也还有一些问题。首先是准备建社工作中没有注意深入宣传政策，有些农民对入社仍然有“怕入社不够吃”、“怕不自由”等思想顾虑，根据五个组组员的思想情况分析，疑虑较大、不想入社组员约占百分之十六，有些曾要求建社的，思想也不够稳定，表现犹豫观望，听到说社的一两句坏话，就动摇了入社信心，说“入了社还不知是红是黑。”这样的组员约占百分之四十。另外，准备工作中，还有孤立建社的缺点，工作只局限于对象组，向广大农民广泛宣传合作化政策和优越性不够。值得注意的是有些工作人员过高估计了这些建社准备工作的成绩，认为今年建社容易，不需要再进行什么宣传发动了。这些情况说明建社准备工作是有一定成绩的，但还须继续进行工作，不能把群众的热情和有利条件代替建社过程中必须的政治和组织工作。
    其次，从九个组中看，有的组骨干培养还不够，有三个组还没有会计，有一组本来有一个可培养的团员，有些组员却说：这个工作很重要，怕他做不好，不敢大胆培养。另外，在检查各组建社准备工作中，还感到全面筹划、分批发展的重要，这里第一批建社组一般准备较好，第二批组领导就注意不够，问题较多，这是需要加以注意的。建社的准备工作应该全盘考虑，长远打算，在第一批互助组准备建社时，不能把第二批组丢掉，应采取“挂钩”办法，走第一步就为第二步作好准备。另外，准备工作还有第一类乡较好、第三类乡较差的不平衡状态，这在建社配备领导力量时应加注意。
