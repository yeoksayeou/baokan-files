Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to TASS news, the Soviet agricultural delegation, invited to visit the United States, after concluding its visit to Iowa, continued to visit Nebraska, Illinois, South Dakota, and Minnesota, observing the conditions of local agricultural crops, agricultural equipment, and agricultural schools.

    The Soviet delegation's visit continues to be welcomed by the American public. At the end of July, some members of the delegation spent an entire day in the livestock area of Nebraska. The owners of the famous Wilbur Dreibelbis livestock farm and another Reese livestock farm said when bidding farewell to the Soviet representatives: "Please remember that you have found good friends here. Our meeting with you makes us even more convinced that the American and Soviet people can and will live together peacefully."

    When the delegation visited South Dakota, the local wheat harvest season was over. However, some farmers, in order to await the delegation's visit, left the already ripe wheat in small plots of land, waiting for the delegation to understand their harvesting methods.

    The American public's interest in the Soviet delegation has not diminished. Local newspapers widely report news of their visit. The Soviet delegation continues to receive many letters and telegrams inviting them to visit.

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to TASS reports, the American agricultural delegation, after visiting the Kuban region, Stalingrad, and Kuibyshev, arrived in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, on the evening of the 11th.

    The delegation arrived in Krasnodar in the Kuban region at the end of July. From there, it toured the Kuban region, visiting various agricultural institutions. The high yields of the land here have won unanimous praise from the delegation members. The representatives pointed out that they saw many good and moving things at the "Revolution Lighthouse" collective farm. At the same time, they also offered criticisms. The guests were received warmly and friendly everywhere in the Kuban.

    On the 7th, the delegation toured the Lenin Volga-Don Canal.

    On the 8th and 9th, the delegation visited museums, the tractor factory, and collective and state farms located in this arid region in Stalingrad, and learned about the city's combat history and recovery work. The delegation leader Lambert led some members of the delegation to visit the Stalingrad Hydropower Station construction project. The scale of this project surprised the guests. Farmer Olson told reporters that after visiting the Stalingrad Hydropower Station project and Stalingrad, the American delegation members were even more convinced that the Soviet Union was carrying out peaceful and constructive labor.

    The delegation arrived in Kuibyshev on the 9th and visited agricultural research and production institutions separately on the 10th. A group headed by Olson visited the Lenin Memorial Collective Farm in the Stavropol region. A moving meeting scene occurred here, and the villagers greeted the guests with bread and salt according to traditional customs. Representatives from neighboring farms came to talk to the guests. Before leaving, the farm's amateur troupe performed for the delegation. On the street near the farm school, the American guests joined the chorus, and everyone sang the Russian song "My Motherland" together.

    苏美两国农业代表团继续参观访问
    新华社讯  据塔斯社消息：应邀访问美国的苏联农业代表团在结束了在衣阿华州的访问后，继续到内布拉斯加州、伊利诺斯州、南达科他州、明尼苏达州参观当地的农业作物情况、农业设备和农业学校。
    苏联代表团的访问继续受到美国公众的欢迎。七月底时，代表团一部分代表到内布拉斯加州的牧畜区渡过了一整天。著名的种畜培育场威尔伯·德莱布勒德畜牧场和另一个里斯畜牧场的主人在送别苏联代表时说：“请你们记住，你们在这里找到了良友。我们和你们的相会使我们更加相信，美国和苏联人民能够，而且将和平地相处。”
    代表团到南达科他州访问时，当地小麦收获季节已过，但是，有些农民为了等待代表团的参观，把早已成熟的小麦留在小片田地里，以待代表团来了解他们的收获方法。
    美国公众对苏联代表团的兴趣仍然没有减退。地方报纸广泛地报道他们访问的消息。苏联代表团继续接到许多邀请他们前去访问的信件和电报。
    新华社讯  据塔斯社报道：美国农业代表团在库班地区、斯大林格勒和古比雪夫等地参观后已于十一日晚到达乌兹别克首都塔什干。
    代表团于七月底到达库班地区的克拉斯诺达。从那里起周游库班地区，参观了各种农业机构。这里的土地的高额收获量博得了代表团人员的一致称赞。代表们指出他们在“革命灯塔”集体农庄看到了许多好的、动人的事情。同时他们也提出了批评的意见。客人们在库班到处都受到了热情友好的接待。
    七日，代表团游览了列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河。
    代表团于八日和九日在斯大林格勒参观了博物馆、拖拉机工厂和位于这个干旱地区的集体农庄和国营农场，并且了解了这个城市的战斗历史和恢复工作。代表团团长兰伯特率领的部分团员还参观了斯大林格勒水电站建设工程。这个工程的规模使客人们感到惊奇。农民奥尔逊对记者说，美国代表团人员在参观斯大林格勒水电站工程和斯大林格勒城之后更加深信，苏联在进行和平的建设性劳动。
    代表团于九日到达古比雪夫，十日即分头参观了农业研究机构和生产机构。以奥尔逊为首的一批人到斯塔夫罗波尔区访问了纪念列宁集体农庄。在这里出现了动人的会见场面，庄员们按照传统的习惯以面包和盐来迎接客人。邻近农庄的代表纷纷来和客人们谈话。临行前，农庄业余剧团还为代表团演出。在农庄学校附近的街道上，美国客人们加入了合唱，所有的人一起唱了俄罗斯歌曲“我的故乡”。
