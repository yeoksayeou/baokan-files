Xinhua News Agency dispatch: At the Pyongyang rally celebrating the tenth anniversary of Korea's liberation on August 14, 1955, A.B. Aristov, head of the Soviet Government Delegation, said, "On this national holiday of the tenth anniversary of the Soviet Army's liberation of Korea, please allow me, on behalf of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and all the Soviet people, to extend sincere, fraternal greetings and warm congratulations to you and, through you, to all the heroic Korean people on this significant day." He continued, "In the ten years since liberation, the lives of the people in North Korea have undergone profound changes. The people, freed from foreign shackles, have become masters of their own destiny for the first time in their history of many centuries, and have gained the possibility of arranging their lives according to their own wishes. In the struggle for democratic reforms, an unbreakable alliance of workers and peasants led by the working class has been formed. On this basis, a new type of people's democratic state system—the Democratic People's Republic of Korea—has emerged and consolidated in North Korea. The unity of Korea's progressive parties, social organizations, and all patriotic forces, which strive to build Korea into a prosperous, unified, independent, and democratic country, has played an extremely positive role in mobilizing the people's strength to accomplish this important task. The establishment of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland reflects the Korean people's desire for unification, and it is an important tool for striving for national unification and restoring the Republic's economy and culture."

Aristov then pointed out that in 1950, the peaceful and creative labor of the North Korean working people was interrupted by a three-year war. The North Korean working people were forced to take up arms to defend their democratic achievements, freedom, and independence. They were firmly convinced of the justice of their cause and demonstrated an extremely high degree of fortitude, courage, and heroism in the course of this war. The Korean War was not only a major disaster for the Korean people but also a serious threat to peace and security in the Far East and the world. Therefore, all peace-loving forces unanimously advocated stopping the war and peacefully resolving the Korean question. The historical achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteers should be particularly noted. They came to assist Korea and, with their immortal actions, promoted the fraternal friendship of the people of the democratic camp countries.

Thanks to the initiative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China, the armistice agreement was reached, which contributed to the relaxation of international tensions and enabled the working people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to resume peaceful labor.

The Soviet people fully understand how difficult and arduous the post-war recovery of industry, transportation, and agriculture has been, and how much sacrifice it has required. At the same time, the Soviet people know from their own experience that these difficulties can certainly be overcome. We see that the heroic and industrious Korean people are victoriously completing the task of eliminating the cruel consequences of the war.

After listing the brilliant achievements made by the working people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in economic construction in the two years since the signing of the armistice agreement, Aristov pointed out that the outstanding achievements of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea vividly demonstrate the great strength and vitality of the people's democratic system, which motivates the broadest masses of the people to engage in active construction and creative activities. The working people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have a reliable leader—the Workers' Party of Korea—tempered in the struggle to establish and consolidate the people's democratic system. It wholeheartedly serves the interests of its people and leads the Korean people along the path of peace, democracy, and national independence.

Aristov concluded by saying, "We all know very well that the Korean people are heavily burdened by the division of their country because this division undermines the unity of their nation. It is well known that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is sincerely committed to finding ways to peacefully restore its country to a unified, peace-loving, and democratic nation. The Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have repeatedly put forward concrete proposals to various political parties, social organizations, the National Assembly, and the government of South Korea aimed at restoring Korea's unification. Regrettably, these proposals have so far not received a positive response from the ruling clique in South Korea, although the majority of residents in South Korea are undoubtedly deeply concerned about the peaceful unification of Korea on a democratic basis. The just struggle of the Korean people to restore the national unification of Korea on a peaceful and democratic basis has received the sympathy and support of all peace-loving people in all countries. The Soviet people fervently hope that the Korean people will soon realize their national aspiration—to establish a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Korea."

"In the struggle to consolidate the people's democratic system and develop the national economy and culture, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has reliable friends in the people of all countries of the powerful socialist and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. The mutual relations among the countries of the socialist camp are a new type of relationship, based on the unity of thought and fundamental interests of the working people of these countries, and on mutual respect and complete equality among the sovereign states within the socialist camp. The friendship and cooperation among the countries of the socialist camp are the guarantee of their strength and invincibility."

"In the ten years since the Soviet Army liberated Korea, lasting fraternal friendship and cooperative relations have been formed and consolidated between the working people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Soviet people. The economic and cultural ties between our two countries are becoming wider and closer."

"The working people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea can be confident that the Soviet people have been and will continue to be their loyal and sincere friends."

Aristov's speech was warmly welcomed and repeatedly interrupted by stormy applause.

    在平壤各界庆祝朝鲜解放十周年大会上
    苏联政府代表团团长阿里斯托夫讲话
    据新华社讯　苏联政府代表团团长阿·布·阿里斯托夫一九五五年八月十四日在平壤各界庆祝朝鲜解放十周年大会上讲话，他说，在苏军解放朝鲜十周年这一民族节日，请允许我代表苏联最高苏维埃主席团、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟部长会议、苏联共产党中央委员会和全体苏联人民在这一意义重大的日子向你们和通过你们向全体英勇的朝鲜人民致以真诚的、兄弟的问候和热烈祝贺。他接着说，在解放以来的十年当中，朝鲜北部人民的生活已发生了深刻的变化。摆脱了外国枷锁的人民在他们多少世纪以来的全部历史中第一次成为自己命运的主人，获得了按照自己的愿望安排自己的生活的可能。在争取民主改革的斗争中形成了以工人阶级为领导的牢不可破的工农联盟。在这一基础上，一个新型的人民民主的国家制度——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国——在朝鲜北部产生和巩固了。朝鲜的进步党派、社会团体和所有爱国力量争取把朝鲜建成一个繁荣、统一、独立和民主的国家，它们的团结一致，在动员人民力量去完成这一重要的任务方面起了极其积极的作用。祖国统一民主主义战线的建立反映了朝鲜人民争取统一的愿望，它是争取全国统一、恢复共和国的经济和文化的一个重要工具。
    阿里斯托夫接着指出，一九五零年，北朝鲜劳动人民的和平创造性劳动被持续三年的战争打断了。北朝鲜劳动人民被迫拿起武器捍卫自己的民主果实、自由和独立，他们坚信自己事业的正义性，在这一战争的过程中表现了极其高度的坚强、勇敢和英雄主义。朝鲜战争不但是朝鲜人民的重大灾害，而且是远东和世界的和平和安全的严重威胁。因此，一切爱好和平的力量一致主张停止战争和和平解决朝鲜问题。中国人民志愿军的历史功绩是应该特别指出的，他们前来援助朝鲜，并且以他们不朽的行动发扬了民主阵营各国人民的兄弟友谊。
    由于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的倡议，停战协定得以达成，这促成了国际紧张局势的缓和，并且使朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的劳动人民能够重新进行和平的劳动。
    苏联人民十分明白，战后工业、运输和农业的恢复曾经是多么艰难和困苦，需要付出多大的牺牲。同时，苏联人民根据自己的经验知道，这些困难是一定能够克服的。我们看到，英勇和勤劳的朝鲜人民在胜利地完成关于消除战争的残酷后果的任务。
    阿里斯托夫接着列举了在停战协定签订以后两年来朝鲜民主主义人民共和国劳动人民在经济建设中取得的辉煌成就以后，并指出，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的卓越成就活生生地表明：推动最广大的人民群众进行积极建设和创造活动的人民民主制度的伟大力量和它的生命力。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国劳动人民有着在争取建立和巩固人民民主制度斗争中锻炼出来的、可靠的领导者——朝鲜劳动党，它全心全意地为自己人民的利益服务，并且领导朝鲜人民沿着和平、民主和国家独立的道路前进。
    阿里斯托夫最后说，我们全都非常清楚地知道，朝鲜人民沉重地遭遇着国家的分裂，因为这种分裂破坏了他们国家的统一。大家知道，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国真诚地致力于寻求道路来和平地把自己的国家恢复成为一个统一的、爱好和平的和民主的国家。朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会、朝鲜最高人民会议和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府曾不止一次地向南朝鲜各党派、社会团体、国会和政府提出旨在恢复朝鲜统一的具体建议。遗憾的是，这些建议至今也没有得到南朝鲜统治集团方面的积极反应，虽然，南朝鲜的大多数居民无疑是切身关心在民主的基础上和平统一朝鲜的。朝鲜人民争取在和平民主基础上恢复朝鲜的国家统一的正义斗争得到了所有爱好和平的各国人民的同情和支持；苏联人民热望朝鲜人民尽速实现自己的民族愿望——建立一个统一、独立、民主和爱好和平的朝鲜。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在争取巩固人民民主制度、发展国民经济和文化的斗争中，有着以苏联和中华人民共和国为首的强大的社会主义和民主阵营的各国人民这样的可靠的朋友。社会主义阵营各国之间的相互关系是一种新型的关系，这种关系的基础是这些国家劳动人民的思想和根本利益的一致性，是社会主义阵营内自主国家之间的相互尊重和完全平等。社会主义阵营各国的友谊和合作是它们的力量和不可战胜性的保证。
    苏军解放朝鲜十年以来，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国劳动人民和苏联人民之间的持久的兄弟友谊和合作的关系已经形成和巩固了。我们两国之间的经济和文化联系日益广泛和日益紧密。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国劳动人民可以相信，苏联人民过去和将来都是他们的忠实的和真挚的朋友。
    阿里斯托夫的讲话，受到热烈的欢迎，并一再为暴风雨般的掌声打断。
