Citizens of Xigaze also listened to his report on wired radio.

　　Jamyang Gedun Jigme said that more than 1,000 representatives from all over the country, including various ethnic groups, discussed national affairs together; the passage of our country's first constitution and the election of national leaders made us more deeply realize that our country is truly a big family of friendship and cooperation among all ethnic groups.

　　In his report, Jamyang Gedun Jigme mentioned that he accompanied the Panchen Erdeni to visit the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province. Seeing that the farmers there were already using machines to cultivate the land and that there were institutions of higher learning for their own ethnic group, he felt that he had clearly seen the future of Tibet.

　　Finally, Jamyang Gedun Jigme said that we, the Tibetan people, must continue to strengthen internal unity and unity with all fraternal ethnic groups, vigorously carry out the work of establishing the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and strive to build Tibet and build the motherland.

　　When Jamyang Gedun Jigme talked about the central government's care for the Tibetan people and the country's growing prosperity, the people present applauded enthusiastically. (Xinhua News Agency)
