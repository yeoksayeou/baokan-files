    Beijing Distillery Should Save More Grain
    Jin Feng
    The state-owned Beijing Distillery has wasted a large amount of grain in the production and storage process in recent years, wasting approximately 3.2 million jin in 1954 alone. After severe criticism from the CPC Beijing East Suburb District Committee and the "Beijing Daily," the factory launched a comprehensive anti-waste campaign in July this year. Currently, the factory has made some achievements in reducing grain waste, but there are still many problems.

      Waste in the Winemaking Process
    One of the main areas where the factory wastes grain is that the amount of grain used in the winemaking process consistently exceeds the national standard. In 1952, this item alone used more than 470,000 jin of extra grain, in 1953 it used more than 1.33 million jin, and in 1954 it used more than 680,000 jin. This year, the state stipulates that every 100 jin of starch should produce 57 jin of alcohol, but in the first half of the year, it only reached 55.66 jin, using more than 360,000 jin of extra grain.

    Why has this factory been unable to reduce grain consumption in the winemaking process for several years? Is it impossible to reach the national standard? The fact is not so. The factory has a Wang Yuzeng team, whose alcohol yield has always been very high (the highest alcohol yield reached 68%). If the leadership carefully summarizes and promotes the advanced experience of this team, it can not only complete the alcohol yield target but also save more grain. However, the factory's leadership is only satisfied with completing the annual profit plan that should be turned over to the state, but does not calculate costs, and has blind complacency and conservative thinking in production management. They believe: "It is very good that our factory pays so much profit to the state every year." "Our factory is a handicraft production method, the production is backward, each worker has his own technique, and no one will accept it even if we summarize the advanced experience." They do not seriously summarize the advanced experience of their own factory but mechanically apply the experience of other places. Last summer, factory director Zhang Yuancun brought in the experience of "yellow-green koji and yeast water" and promoted it across the board without considering the factory's situation; as a result, 290,000 jin of alcohol were produced less. This spring, deputy factory director Wang Zhizhong insisted on mechanically applying the "low-temperature fermentation method" from other places, resulting in another 90,000 jin of alcohol being produced less.

    In this anti-waste campaign, the leadership first criticized the complacent and conservative thinking that ignored saving grain and reducing costs. They originally thought that "although this year's production has not completed the national plan, it is much better than last year," "grain is only the raw material of the product, which factory's raw materials are not wasted," "the factory deals with grain all day long, how can it not spill a little." In the past, they turned a blind eye to the large amount of grain wasted in various links of the factory, and did not accept workers' suggestions for improvement. This time, after calculating the detailed accounts, they were shocked to see that so much grain was wasted to the state every year, and they realized the serious political and economic significance of saving grain.

    At that time, the factory formed three experience summary groups, which respectively summarized the advanced operating experience of the Wang Yuzeng team, which consistently completed the alcohol yield plan target; the operating method of using distiller's grains koji; and the operating method of using distiller's grains koji plus yeast. In addition, they paid attention to leading the production teams to hold meetings to exchange technical operating experience, and checked the fermentation situation with each other once a day to help each other in order to improve the starch alcohol yield. Summer is an unfavorable season for winemaking, and production must be reduced if the temperature cannot be lowered. This year, the production equipment was adjusted, electric fans were added, the labor organization was improved, and the production time was changed to ensure cooling.

    After these measures were taken, the workers were in high spirits. Most of them came from the countryside and had long been dissatisfied with the factory's large waste of grain. Some said, "When growing crops at home, we have to pick up every grain that falls on the threshing ground. Here, grain is not taken seriously, and it really hurts to watch." Some said, "The peasant brothers work hard to grow grain and sell it to the state. If they knew that our factory wasted grain like this, and they came to ask us, we really wouldn't be able to answer." In the anti-waste campaign, they strictly criticized the shortcomings of the leadership and actively improved the operating methods. In early July, the alcohol yield reached the national standard, breaking the records of the same period in 1953 and 1954, and saving 20,000 jin of grain. They also put forward many suggestions to plug other loopholes in the production process that waste grain. For example, in the past, the grain that was washed into the sewer with the water from the bottom of the steaming pot amounted to more than 200 jin per day. Now, they have proposed to spread an extra layer of rice husk when loading the steamer, and to remove the grate before pouring when washing the pot, which avoids the loss of grain. In the past, when the mud sealing the surface of the fermentation tank was removed, a lot of wine mash was often removed with it; now the workers have proposed a method of sprinkling an extra layer of chaff, so the wine mash will not be removed with the mud. In addition, they use brooms to sweep the wine mash off their feet when entering and leaving the workshop, and they also pay attention to not throwing grain when receiving materials.

    Currently, the factory's alcohol yield cannot always maintain a normal level, and the production is very uneven; this directly affects the saving of grain. Therefore, it is necessary to further combine the opposition to wasting grain with the improvement of production technology and operating methods.

      Waste in the Koji Making Workshop
    Another place where the distillery wastes grain is the koji making workshop. According to national regulations, the proportion of grain in the koji making raw materials is 26%; in 1954, the actual average grain input for the whole year was 47%. This item alone used more than 1,588,800 jin of extra grain. The wheat bran needed for koji making was once lacking, and the factory leaders did not seriously supervise the purchase, nor did they study the use of other substitutes, so they used good grain instead of wheat bran. They believed: "Anyway, the more grain there is, the more it will be turned into alcohol." In fact, the quality of the koji produced was not good. Due to insufficient humidity in the fermentation room, the koji often had a dry skin on it. After the finished product was put into the warehouse, the management was poor, the koji was poured on the ground, and many koji bacteria flew away when it was turned over. These directly affected the quality of the koji, so that the white wine workshop used more koji than the national plan target. The state stipulates that 9 liang of koji should be used per jin of alcohol, but in 1954, an average of 11 liang was used, consuming more than 1,650,000 jin of extra koji for the whole year, equivalent to more than 777,000 jin of grain. In the first quarter of this year, more than 68,000 jin of grain were wasted in this area.

    In this anti-waste campaign, in addition to strictly controlling the proportion of grain in the koji making raw materials to not exceed 25%, the workshop also began the trial production of distiller's grains koji. (Mixing a part of distiller's grains as a substitute can reduce the proportion of grain used to about 20%.) Originally, the distiller's grains koji had been successfully trial-produced in this factory as early as 1953, but the leaders were greedy for the convenience of making koji with grain and did not adopt this method for a long time. Now, realizing the significance of saving grain, they have resumed the trial production of distiller's grains koji.

    In order to improve the quality of the koji, the workshop installed three sprayers to spray water directly into the koji boxes, eliminating the phenomenon of dry skin on the surface. When the koji is put into the warehouse, it is placed in the koji boxes to dry, and then directly loaded into burlap bags and transported to the white wine workshop to reduce the loss of koji bacteria.

    In the past, the grain material lost from the material-steaming pot in the koji making workshop leaked more than 30 jin of raw materials every day with the pot-washing water. Now, the workers use carrying baskets to catch it. After the water flows away, the remaining raw materials can be reused. In the past, a lot of raw materials were scattered halfway on the material-loading car, and a lot was blown away by the wind. Now, a cloth cover is put on the car, and the car is tied with a rope when it is full.

    However, there are still many cases of waste in this area. More than 20 thermometers are broken every month. Sometimes there are not enough koji boxes, and the finished product is still poured on the ground, and many koji bacteria fly away. The quality standard of koji cannot be maintained regularly. More seriously, the trial production of distiller's grains koji is not well organized, the problem of substitutes has not been well resolved, and the proportion of grain used still cannot be reduced to the level that should be achieved.

    Waste in the Warehouse
    Walking into the Beijing Distillery, the most prominent impression is that there are a lot of sparrows. Whether in the workshop or in the warehouse, sparrows fly around everywhere, chirping, which is more noisy than in the forest.

    This is still the case now - after a layer of wire mesh has been newly installed on the windows and door frames of the warehouse. A month ago, there was no obstruction, and groups of sparrows flew in and out more freely, "living and working in peace and contentment." Rats also openly run around here during the day. It is estimated that in 1954 alone, the warehouse lost more than 150,000 jin of grain, and in the first half of this year, it lost more than 58,000 jin. Compared with the actual losses, these figures will only be lower, not higher. The factory does not have a weighing system for grain entering the warehouse, and there are no exact figures for the losses in transportation and on the pulverizer. Last year, they determined a loss rate of 0.75%, that is, 12 liang of grain were lost per 100 jin; but the actual loss rate last year exceeded 1%.

    The warehouse keepers asked the factory leaders to make sparrow-proof wire mesh as early as 1952, but they were all rejected by the factory director. In March this year, the workers made another request, but the factory director Zhang Yuancun said: "How much can sparrows eat? How much is the economic effect of making wire mesh?" Thus, it was not resolved until May. The CPC Beijing East Suburb District Committee and others repeatedly raised this issue before the factory director reluctantly agreed to accept the workers' request.

    The factory leaders still have no idea how much the normal loss of a grain warehouse should be in a year. In this anti-waste campaign, the workers actively dismantled sparrow nests, plugged rat holes, and killed and captured a total of 1,411 sparrows. In the discussion, they proposed that the loss rate in the second half of the year should be reduced to 0.45%.

    The Key to Saving Lies in Leadership
    Now, the anti-waste campaign in the Beijing Distillery has achieved certain results. Whether it can be persisted and made greater achievements depends on whether the factory leadership is determined to rely on the masses, to further deepen the implementation of the campaign, and to closely combine saving grain, saving funds, improving production technology, and improving management and leadership.

    From the current situation, the factory leadership still needs to solve the following problems in saving grain:

    1. The problem of conservative thinking reflected in the formulation of the savings plan. Now they have tentatively determined that the whole factory will save a total of 562,454 jin of grain in the second half of the year. This figure is low. This only includes part of the savings figures for the white wine workshop, the koji making workshop, and the warehouse, that is, roughly the figures for maintaining the current production level, and does not include the figures for improving production and tapping potential, nor does it include the savings figures for the liquor workshop, the mechanical workshop, and the management organization. Even based on the current figures, they are not accurate. For example, the proportion of koji used in the white wine workshop has been reduced due to the reduction of waste from dry skin and koji bacteria and the improvement of the quality of koji. However, the leaders believe that "there is not much certainty" and have not included it in the savings figures. The Ministry of Light Industry stipulates that saved grain must be turned over, and if the savings plan is not completed, it must also be turned over from funds; the factory leaders are afraid of not completing the plan, so they set the plan too low.

    2. The problem of improving operating techniques and management. The factory has long failed to complete the plan for alcohol yield, and the quality problem of koji making and the raw material matching problem have not been reasonably resolved, mainly because the leaders are subjective, do not believe in the masses, and do not rely on the masses. For example, the workers have put forward more than 100 rationalization proposals for reducing waste and improving production in the past few years, but only one has been processed in the first half of this year. In this anti-waste campaign, although the leadership's thinking has changed somewhat, it is not thorough. In the process of summarizing the advanced experience of the Wang Yuzeng team and trial-producing distiller's grains koji, the leadership has shown a tight start and a loose end, and currently, these two tasks are likely to fall into a state of self-flow and even no results; and these are important tasks that are directly related to improving production, reducing costs, and saving grain.

    3. The problem of formulating systems and consolidating the results of the campaign. The factory's management work has always been chaotic, and many necessary systems in production management have not been established or are not sound even if they have been established. Therefore, there is a large amount of waste in various links, and it is not easy to check and improve. In this campaign, the leaders began to pay attention to this issue and are revising and improving various systems based on the rationalization proposals put forward by the employees; however, the progress is slow, and many problems have not been resolved in a timely manner. For example, the main production workshop - the white wine workshop - still does not have unified operating procedures, and the leaders have always believed that "our production is a handicraft method, and it is not easy to unify," and have not seriously combined the summary and promotion of the experience of advanced teams to formulate operating procedures. The relatively simple and easy-to-implement warehouse management system and material receiving, issuing, and returning system have not yet been implemented. These will inevitably affect the in-depth development and consolidation of the anti-waste campaign, as well as the establishment of a regular savings system.

### 北京酿酒厂应当节约更多的粮食

    北京酿酒厂应当节约更多的粮食
    金凤
    国营北京酿酒厂几年来在生产和保管过程中大量浪费了粮食，仅仅一九五四年一年就浪费了大约三百二十万斤。经过中共北京东郊区委员会和“北京日报”的严厉批评，这个工厂在今年七月全面展开了反浪费运动。目前，这个厂在减少粮食的浪费方面已经有了一些成绩，但是也还有不少问题。
      造酒过程中的浪费
    这个工厂浪费粮食的主要的一个方面，是在制酒的过程中所用粮食始终超过国家规定的指标。一九五二年只是这一项就多用粮食四十七万多斤，一九五三年多用一百三十三万多斤，一九五四年多用六十八万多斤。今年国家规定每一百斤淀粉出酒五十七斤，上半年只达到五十五点六六斤，又多用粮食三十六万多斤。
    这个工厂几年来为什么在制酒过程中不能降低粮食用量呢？是不是没有可能达到国家规定的指标呢？事实并不如此。这个工厂有一个王育增小组，出酒率一向都很高（出酒率最高时曾达到百分之六十八）。如果领导方面认真总结和推广这个小组的先进经验，不仅可以完成出酒率指标，还可以节约更多的粮食。但是这个工厂的领导方面仅仅满足于完成每年应该上缴给国家的利润计划，却不计算成本，在生产管理上有盲目自满和保守思想。他们认为：“我们这种厂每年给国家缴这么多利润就很不错了。”“我们厂是手工业方式的生产，生产就是落后，工人一人一个手法，总结了先进经验别人也不服气。”他们不认真总结本厂的先进经验，却生搬硬套外地的经验。去年夏天，厂长张元村搬来“黄绿曲及酵母水”的经验，不考虑本厂情况，就全面推广；结果，少出了二十九万斤酒。今年春天，副厂长王致中硬搬外地的“低温发酵法”，结果又少出了九万斤酒。
    在这次反浪费运动中，领导方面首先批判了忽视节约粮食、忽视降低成本等自满保守思想。他们原来认为“今年生产虽没有完成国家计划，但比去年好得多”，“粮食只是产品的原材料，哪个厂的原材料没有浪费”，“工厂成天跟粮食打交道，那能不抛点撒点”。过去，他们对于工厂各个环节大量浪费粮食熟视无睹，工人提改进意见也不接受。这次一算细帐，每年给国家浪费粮食那么多，他们才大吃一惊，认识到节约粮食的严重的政治意义和经济意义。
    当时工厂组成三个总结经验小组，分别总结一贯完成出酒率计划指标的王育增小组的先进操作经验；使用酒糟曲的操作方法；以及使用酒糟曲加酵母的操作方法。此外，注意领导各生产小组开好交流技术操作经验的会议，每天互相检查一次发酵情况，互相帮助，以提高淀粉出酒率。夏季是酿酒不利季节，温度降不下去就要减产。今年调剂了生产设备，增设了电风扇，改进了劳动组织，变换了生产时间，保证了降温。
    采取了这些措施以后，工人情绪很高。他们大多数是从农村来的，对于工厂大量浪费粮食早就不满。有的说：“在家种庄稼，场上掉一粒粮食都要捡起来。这里把粮食不当回事，看着真叫人心疼。”有的说：“农民弟兄辛辛苦苦种出粮食来，卖给国家，他们如果知道咱们厂这样浪费粮食，找到咱们问一声，真没法回答。”在反浪费运动中，他们严格地批评了领导方面的缺点，积极改进了操作方法。七月上旬，出酒率达到了国家规定的指标，突破了一九五三年和一九五四年同时期的纪录，节约粮食二万斤。他们又提出许多建议，堵塞生产过程中其他浪费粮食的漏洞。如蒸酒底锅过去随水冲到下水道的粮食，每天有二百多斤。现在他们提出装甑时多铺一层稻皮，冲锅时抽下篦子来再倒，这就避免了粮食的损失。过去发酵池揭去表面封的泥巴时常随着揭去不少酒醅；现在工人提出了多撒一层糠的办法，酒醅就不会随泥揭去了。另外，他们进出车间都用扫帚扫清脚上的酒醅，领料时也注意不抛撒粮食。
    目前，这个厂的出酒率还不能经常保持正常的水平，生产很不均衡；这直接影响了粮食的节约。因此，必须把反对浪费粮食同改进生产技术及操作方法等进一步结合起来。
      制曲车间里的浪费
    酿酒厂另一个浪费粮食的地方是制曲车间。按照国家规定，制曲原料中的粮食比例是百分之二十六；一九五四年实际全年平均粮食投入量却占百分之四十七。这一项，多用了粮食一百五十八万八千多斤。制曲中所需要的麸皮一度缺乏，工厂领导方面没有认真督促采购，也没有研究使用其他代用品，就用好粮代替麸皮。他们认为：“反正粮食多了也都变成酒。”实际上所制成曲的质量并不好。由于发酵室湿度不足，曲子经常有一层干皮。成品入库后管理不善，曲子倒在地上，翻倒时又飞走许多曲菌。这些都直接影响到曲的质量，以致白酒车间用曲又超过国家计划指标。国家规定一斤酒用九两曲，一九五四年平均用到十一两，全年多耗曲一百六十五万多斤，折合粮食七十七万七千多斤。今年第一季度，在这方面又浪费粮食六万八千多斤。
    在这次反浪费运动中，车间除严格掌握制曲原料的粮食比例不超过百分之二十五以外，又开始了酒糟曲的试制工作。（掺用一部分酒糟为代用品，可把用粮食的比例降低到百分之二十左右。）本来，酒糟曲在这个工厂早于一九五三年就试制成功了，但是领导方面贪图用粮食制曲的方便，长期不采用这个方法。现在，认识到节约粮食的意义，才恢复了酒糟曲的试制工作。
    为了改进曲的质量，车间装设了三部喷雾器，直接向曲匣喷水，消灭了表面起干皮的现象。曲子入库时放在曲匣晾好，直接装入麻袋运到白酒车间，以减少曲菌的损失。
    制曲车间蒸料锅过去每天随刷锅水漏走三十多斤原料。现在工人用担筐接着，水流走了，剩下的原料还可以重新使用。过去上料的车半道撒掉原料很多，风也刮走不少。现在车上盖上布罩，装满了车就用绳子拴好。
    但是，在这方面的浪费情况目前还有不少。温度表一个月要摔坏二十多支。曲匣有时不够用，成品还往地下倒，飞走曲菌还不少。曲的质量标准不能经常保持。更严重的是酒糟曲的试制工作组织得不好，代用品的问题没有很好解决，用粮食的比例数仍不能降低到应当做到的程度。
    仓库里的浪费
    走进北京酿酒厂，最突出的印象是麻雀非常之多。无论在车间，在仓库，麻雀到处飞来飞去，叽叽喳喳，比在树林中还喧闹。
    这还是现在——仓库的窗子和门框上都新装了一层铁丝罩之后的情形。一个月以前，什么阻挡也没有，成群的麻雀更是自由地飞出飞进，“安居乐业”。老鼠在这里也公然在白天跑来跑去。据估计：一九五四年一年，仓库损耗粮食十五万多斤，今年上半年又损耗五万八千多斤。同实际损失相比，这些数字是只会偏低不会过高的。这个工厂粮食入库没有过秤制度，运输上的损耗、粉碎机上的损耗都没有确切的数字。去年他们确定了一个损耗率——百分之零点七五，即一百斤粮食损失十二两；但去年的实际损耗率超过百分之一。
    仓库保管工人在一九五二年就向工厂领导方面要求做挡麻雀的铁丝网，可是都被厂长拒绝了。今年三月，工人又提出要求，厂长张元村却说：“麻雀究竟能吃掉多少？做铁丝罩的经济效果究竟有多大？”这样，一直拖到五月份还没有解决。中共北京东郊区委等一再提出这个问题，厂长才勉强同意接受工人的要求。
    究竟粮食仓库一年正常的损耗应当是多少，工厂领导方面至今心中无数。工人在这次反浪费运动中，积极拆除麻雀窝，堵塞老鼠洞，共打死和活捉麻雀一千四百十一只。他们在讨论中提出：下半年的损耗率要减到百分之零点四五。
    节约的关键在于领导
    现在，北京酿酒厂的反浪费运动已收到一定效果。能不能坚持下去做出更大成绩，就要看工厂领导方面是不是有决心依靠群众，使运动进一步深入地贯彻下去，把节约粮食、节约资金和改进生产技术、改善管理领导紧密地结合起来。
    从目前的情况来看，这个工厂的领导方面在节约粮食中还有这样一些问题需要解决：
    一、制定节约计划中反映的保守思想问题。现在他们初步确定下半年全厂共节约粮食五十六万二千四百五十四斤。这个数字是偏低的。这只包括了白酒车间、制曲车间和仓库的一部分节约数字，即大致是维持目前生产水平的数字，并未包括改进生产、挖掘潜力的数字，也未包括露酒车间、机械车间及管理机构的节约数字。只就目前的数字来说也不精确。如制曲车间由于减少了干皮及曲菌的浪费，曲的质量有所提高，白酒车间用曲的比例数量已经降低。但领导方面认为“把握不大”，没有计算在节约数字内。轻工业部规定节约粮食必须上缴，如果节约计划完不成也须从资金抽出上缴；工厂领导方面怕完不成计划，就把计划订得偏低。
    二、改进操作技术和管理问题。这个工厂出酒率长期完不成计划，制曲的质量问题以及原材料配合问题得不到合理解决，主要是领导方面主观主义、不相信群众、不依靠群众。例如，工人几年来提出过减少浪费、改进生产的合理化建议一百多条，但只在今年上半年处理了一条。在这次反浪费运动中，领导思想虽有所改变，但并不彻底。在总结王育增小组的先进经验及试制酒糟曲的过程中，领导方面表现前紧后松，目前这两件工作很有陷于自流以至无结果的可能；而这些正是同改进生产、降低成本、节约粮食有直接关系的重要工作。
    三、制定制度、巩固运动成果的问题。这个工厂的管理工作一向混乱，生产管理方面许多必要的制度没有建立或者建立了而不健全。因此，各个环节都有大量的浪费，而且不易检查和改进。在这次运动中，领导方面开始注意了这个问题，正根据职工提出的合理化建议，修订和健全各种制度；但是，进度缓慢，许多问题没有及时解决。如主要生产车间——白酒车间至今还没有统一的操作规程，领导方面一直认为“我们的生产是手工业方式，不好统一”，没有认真地结合总结和推广先进小组的经验制定操作规程。比较简单易行的仓库管理制度和领发收退料制度，至今也没有实行。这些必然影响到反浪费运动的深入开展和巩固，以及经常性的节约制度的建立。
