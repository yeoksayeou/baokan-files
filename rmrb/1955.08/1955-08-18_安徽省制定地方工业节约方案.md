Anhui Province's local industrial departments have formulated a preliminary plan for implementing comprehensive conservation, which will save the state nearly two million yuan in investment this year.

The Anhui Provincial Department of Industry convened a provincial local industrial capital construction conference in late June to examine and criticize some wasteful phenomena in capital construction in 1954, and re-examined this year's investment projects. The twenty-one units present all set preliminary plans for conservation.

The main requirements of Anhui Province's local industry's conservation plan this year are to resolutely reduce the standards of non-productive buildings and auxiliary construction, and to cut projects that are dispensable. For example, for the Hefei Flour Mill, which will begin construction this year, the construction standard for dormitories will be reduced from 90 yuan per square meter to 40 yuan, and the office building will be reduced from 90 yuan to 46 yuan. The construction area of ​​office buildings and dormitories will be reduced by 1,200 square meters, and the construction area of ​​the factory buildings will also be reduced by 380 square meters. The Anhui Phosphate Fertilizer Plant, whose original design standards were relatively low, plans to reduce the investment amount by about 10% this time, and will save 32% in non-productive buildings. The Wuhu Mingyuan Hydropower Plant has decided to postpone the construction of the sand filtration pool, which is not urgently needed at present. Specific measures have also been decided to be taken in financial management and the storage, transportation and allocation of equipment and materials to implement strict conservation.

    安徽省制定地方工业节约方案
    安徽省地方工业部门已经制定了厉行全面节约的初步方案，今年将为国家节约投资近二百万元。
    安徽省工业厅在六月下旬曾经召开全省地方工业基本建设会议，检查和批判了一九五四年基本建设中的一些浪费现象，重新审查了今年的投资项目。到会的二十一个单位都定出了节约的初步计划。
    安徽省地方工业今年厉行节约的方案，主要要求坚决降低非生产性建筑和附属建设的标准，削减可办可不办的工程。如将在今年开工建设的合肥面粉厂，要把宿舍建筑标准由每平方公尺造价九十元降低为四十元，办公室由九十元降低为四十六元，办公室和宿舍建筑面积要缩减一千二百平方公尺，厂房建筑面积也要削减三百八十平方公尺。原来设计标准比较低的安徽磷肥厂，这次计划再降低投资额百分之十左右，在非生产性建筑中将节约百分之三十二。芜湖明远水电厂决定推迟现在不急需的沙滤池建筑工程。在财务管理和设备材料的保管、调运等方面也决定采取具体措施，厉行节约。
