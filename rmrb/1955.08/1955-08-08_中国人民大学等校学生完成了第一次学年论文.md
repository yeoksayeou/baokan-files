    中国人民大学、北京大学近两千名学生在这个学年中结合专业联系实际，完成了第一次学年论文。
    中国人民大学学生共写论文一千七百多篇。财政信贷系三年级预算一班学生张敏的论文“第一个五年计划时期中国财政的任务”，运用充分材料系统全面地说明了如何贯彻资金重点使用的原则，和在资金的使用过程中加强财政监督、节约使用资财，发掘内部潜力等具体措施。他的论文获得优等成绩。贸易系供销与消费合作社专业三年级学生仇庆才的论文“我国供销合作社在城乡贸易结合中的作用”，也得到教师的好评。北京大学二百多名学生完成的学年论文中，有研究我国古典文学名著和“五四”以来的新文学的，有批判胡风反动的文艺思想的，也有研究鸟禽和其他动物生态等问题的。
    在写学年论文前，学生们阅读了主要参考书，搜集有关资料，并在研究过程中写了读书笔记。
