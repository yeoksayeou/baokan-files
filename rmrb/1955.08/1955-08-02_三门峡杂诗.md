    Miscellaneous Poems on the Sanmenxia Gorge
    By Feng Zhi

    I. Sanmenxia

    The Yellow River carved open three gates through the rock,
    It is said to have happened in the primordial age,
    From there it flowed towards the eastern plains,
    Rushing towards the distant sea.

    It rampaged across the loess plains,
    Bringing endless disasters to our ancestors;
    Listening to the sound of its rapid currents at midnight,
    One still thinks of the bitter and difficult yesterday.

    The stone gate cannot stop the raging river,
    But it blocks the passage of ships on the river;
    Neither the Ghost Gate nor the God Gate can be passed,
    Even passing through the Human Gate is fraught with danger.

    For thousands of years, the boat cables and punting poles
    Have worn stone holes and grooves in the Human Gate;
    How people fought against nature,
    These traces are the most authentic reports.

    Now all of this is about to become the past,
    Sanmenxia is about to change its appearance.
    The raging river will listen to our commands,
    It will no longer be allowed to rampage across the plains.

    The ferocious rocks will become a solid dam,
    Transmitting water and electricity to near and far,
    Tens of millions of mu of crops will grow in peace,
    Machines in cities large and small will operate in peace.

    We will use five or six years of limited time,
    To end thousands of years of unlimited suffering;
    We will use several decades of limited time,
    To create thousands of years of unlimited happiness.

    II. Survey Team

    Look at these young people carrying instruments on their backs,
    Their skin tanned dark,
    They climb steep rocks,
    Braving the summer heat and winter cold.

    Humming cheerful songs,
    With no hardship in their eyes,
    They are the agile vanguards,
    On the forefront of a great undertaking.

    How high are the mountains? How deep is the water?
    What is the flow rate in cubic meters per second?
    How hard are the rocks above and below ground,
    How much pressure can they withstand?

    Not even a fraction of a millimeter of error is allowed,
    Because "a hair's breadth of difference can lead to a thousand miles of error."
    Before their focused attention,
    Nature completely loses its mystery.

    This is only the beginning of a great undertaking,
    The Yellow River is already being disarmed.
    No matter what work the good sons and daughters of New China do,
    It will make friends cheer and enemies despondent.

    III. Both Banks of the River

    On the high mountaintops on both banks of the river
    There remain rows of beacon towers,
    They transmitted so many terrifying messages,
    In those ancient times of frequent turmoil.

    On the high mountaintops on both banks of the river
    Flutter the small red flags of the survey team,
    They shine in the azure sky,
    Showing more joy in the future.

    IV. Central Pillar of the River

    You stand in the center of the river,
    Causing the river to have rapid currents,
    Since there have been boats on the Yellow River,
    You have made things difficult for passing ships.

    Throughout history, how many boatmen
    Have shed blood and sweat before you;
    How many unfortunate travelers
    Have been buried beside you.

    In the past, some onlookers
    Called you the "Central Pillar of the River,"
    And even used this term to praise those people—
    If they were obstructing social progress.

    Now we cannot tolerate you,
    Just as we cannot tolerate obstacles to progress,
    Soon a day will come,
    When we will crush you and throw you out of the Yellow River.

              Written on the night of June 20th at Sanmenxia
                        Organized on July 14th

    三门峡杂诗
    冯至
    一、三门峡
    黄河把岩石冲开三座门，
    据说是在洪荒的时代，
    从此它流向东方的平原，
    奔向远远的大海。
    它在黄土平原上横行，
    把无穷的灾害带给我们的祖先；
    夜半听着它急流的声音，
    还想得到多苦多难的昨天。
    石门挡不住滔滔的河水，
    却阻挡着河水上的行船；
    鬼门、神门都不能通过，
    通过人门也要冒着危险。
    千百年的船缆、船篙
    在人门上磨出来石孔、石槽；
    人们怎样和自然搏斗，
    这些痕迹是最真实的报道。
    如今这一切都要成为过去，
    三门峡就要改变面容。
    滔滔的河水听我们使唤，
    再也不许它在平原上横行。
    凶恶的岩石变成坚固的水坝，
    把水和电向远近输送，
    几千万亩的庄稼在和平里生长，
    大小城市的机器在和平里开动。
    我们用五六年有限的时间，
    结束千百年无限的痛苦；
    我们用几十年有限的时间，
    创造千百年无限的幸福。
    二、勘测队
    看这些背上背着仪器、
    皮肤晒得黑黑的青年，
    他们攀登着峻峭的岩石，
    冒着夏天的烈日、冬天的风寒。
    嘴里哼着快乐的歌曲，
    眼里没有艰难，
    他们是矫健的尖兵，
    在一个伟大事业的最前线。
    山是多么高？水是多么深？
    每一秒的流量是多少公方？
    地上地下的岩石是多么坚硬，
    多大的压力它们能够担当？
    不容有一毫一厘的差错，
    因为“差之毫厘，失之千里”。
    在他们聚精会神的面前，
    自然完全失却了它的神秘。
    这不过是伟大事业的开端，
    黄河已经在解除武装。
    新中国好儿女无论什么工作，
    都是让朋友欢呼，敌人沮丧。
    三、河两岸
    河两岸高高的山顶上
    残存着一座座的烽火台，
    它们传递过多少恐怖消息，
    在那变乱频仍的古代。
    河两岸高高的山顶上
    飘扬着勘测队的小红旗，
    它们照映在蔚蓝的天空，
    显示着将来更多的欢喜。
    四、中流砥柱
    你竖立在河水的中央，
    使河水发生了急湍，
    自从黄河上有了船只，
    你就和来往的船只为难。
    古往今来，有多少船夫
    在你的跟前流出血汗；
    有多少不幸的远行人
    葬身在你的身边。
    过去却有些旁观者
    把你叫作“中流砥柱”，
    还用这个称呼去称赞那些人——
    若是他们阻挡社会的进步。
    现在我们不能容忍你，
    像是不能容忍进步的障碍，
    不久有一天会来到，
    把你粉碎，抛出黄河以外。
