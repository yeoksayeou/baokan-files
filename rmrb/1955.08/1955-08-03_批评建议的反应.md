    Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions

    The CCP Nanhui County Committee of Jiangsu Province writes: The facts stated in the article "Give Punishment to Those Who Retaliate and Deceive the Party Newspaper" published in the "Reader's Letters Page" on March 20th are completely true. We have decided to give Yu Nengfu a punishment of two years of probation within the Party. Wu Xinmin, the County Party Secretary, and Liu Shanchang, the County Head, have also made self-criticisms.

    The Station Master of Huangguantun Railway Station writes: The article "One Carload of Railroad Ties' Erroneous Journey" published in the "Reader's Letters Page" on July 10th is consistent with the facts. We have given disciplinary warnings to the derelict personnel and guarantee that similar errors will not occur in the future.

    The Tianzhen County Department Store writes: The article "A Salesman Who Doesn't Understand the Business" published in the "Reader's Letters Page" on July 10th is correct, and the personnel involved have been punished.

    The CCP Hegang Regional Committee writes: We sincerely accept the stern criticism of "Hegang Special Zone Organs Receiving Salaries for Phantom Employees and Spending Money Recklessly" in the "Reader's Letters Page" on July 3rd. We have conducted a comprehensive review of this issue and will submit a list of surplus items in inventory to the higher-level authorities for disposal.

    The CCP Xinchang County Committee of Zhejiang Province writes: The criticism in the "Reader's Letters Page" on April 17th regarding our county's lack of attention to the production of medicinal materials (mainly Atractylodes macrocephala) is correct. We will strengthen our leadership over this work in the future, and in June, we supplied cake fertilizer to the medicinal material producing areas.

    The Joint State-Private Qixin Cement Company writes: The criticism of us by readers in the "Reader's Letters Page" on June 26th is correct. Because several of our cement plant's rotary kilns are poorly designed, poorly managed, and the quantity of products has increased in recent years, the amount of raw material powder flying out of the chimneys has also increased. We have now decided to designate specific personnel to study and resolve this issue to improve environmental sanitation and reduce unnecessary losses.

    The Jiaohe Mining Bureau writes that they accept the criticism published in the "Reader's Letters Page" on June 6th regarding "Building a Vertical Shaft Without Exploration, Causing Huge Waste." In addition to requesting punishment from higher-level leading organs, they have also made a self-criticism of past errors in violating construction procedures and are determined to study hard and do a good job in the future.

    Li Zhengqing, Director of the Linxi Coal Washing Plant of Kailuan Coal Mine, and Wang Wen, Secretary of the Party General Branch, write to accept the criticism in the "Reader's Letters Page" on July 3rd (the original letter of criticism was titled "Shouldn't Such Waste Be Opposed?"), guaranteeing that they will overcome the erroneous thinking of seeking personal enjoyment and lacking a mass perspective in the future.

    The General Office of the Ministry of Commerce writes: The suggestions of readers Zhu Jintang and Yang Guanyin on improving cotton cloth packaging methods to reduce losses of remnants have been studied by relevant units such as the Ministry of Textile Industry, the Ministry of Local Industry, and the Ministry of Commerce, organized by the Fourth Office of the State Council. To avoid the confusion that may be caused by changing the packaging, it has been decided to first conduct trials in Beijing and Shanghai starting on June 1st, and then gradually promote it after summarizing the experience.

    The Nanwan Reservoir Headquarters writes that they accept the criticism published in the newspaper on June 26th regarding "Chaotic Management and Serious Waste at the Nanwan Construction Site." After the headquarters discovered the accumulation and waste situation at the Nanwan construction site in April and May through inspections, they began to pay attention to solving this problem. At present, the accumulation and waste on the construction site have been basically overcome, and construction management has also been improved.

    On June 11th, Su Shirong, a worker from the automobile repair factory of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, visited our newspaper to report that the factory had a backlog of wood and that some of it was beginning to rot due to lack of proper storage. After our newspaper relayed the readers' opinions to the factory, the factory covered the existing wood with mats and tarpaulins and strengthened contact with the departments using the materials, striving to allocate and use them as soon as possible.

    公私合营启新水泥公司来信：六月二十六日“读者来信专页”上读者对我们的批评是正确的。由于我们水泥厂有几台回转窑设计不好，管理不善，再加上近年来产品数量增加，因此从烟囱里飞掉的生料粉也增多了。现在我们决定指定专人研究解决这个问题，以利于改进环境卫生，并且减少不应有的损失。

    南湾水库指挥部来信接受六月二十六日报上发表的“南湾工地管理混乱浪费严重”的批评。南湾工地上积压浪费的情况，在四、五月份经指挥部检查发现后，就开始注意解决这个问题。目前工地上的积压浪费已基本克服，施工管理工作也有了改进。
    六月十一日，解放军某部汽车修理厂工人苏世荣来访本报，反映这个工厂积压一批木料，并且因为不注意保管而有一部分开始腐朽。经本报把读者意见转告这个工厂，这个工厂已把现存的木料用席子和篷布盖好，并且加强同用料部门联系，争取及早调拨使用。
