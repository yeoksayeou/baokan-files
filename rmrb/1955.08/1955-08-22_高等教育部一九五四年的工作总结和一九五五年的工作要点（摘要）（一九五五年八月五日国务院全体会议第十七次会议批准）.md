　　Summary of the Work of the Ministry of Higher Education in 1954 and Key Points of Work in 1955 (Abstract)
　　(Approved by the 17th Plenary Session of the State Council on August 5, 1955)
　　In 1954, higher education work achieved further development and improvement on the basis of 1953. (1) The enrollment plan was completed relatively smoothly, with an actual enrollment of 92,609 new students, bringing the total number of students in school to 258,391, an increase of 19.2 percent compared to the beginning of the 1953-1954 academic year. At the beginning of the 1954-1955 academic year, new students from worker and peasant backgrounds accounted for 36.74 percent of the total number of new students, and Party and League members accounted for 50 percent of the total number of new students. (2) More significant achievements have been made in comprehensively and systematically studying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and further implementing teaching reform. During the year, unified teaching plans were formulated for 173 specialties in engineering, science, liberal arts, agriculture, medicine, finance, and law, as well as teaching plans for 159 specialties in secondary vocational schools in engineering, agriculture, medicine, and finance. This changed the chaotic situation in the past where different schools had different curriculum categories, teaching progress, teaching hours, course scheduling, and teaching methods for the same specialty, resulting in inconsistent standards for cultivating talent. In 1954, the Higher Education Publishing House and other specialized publishing houses published a total of 455 kinds of textbooks from Soviet universities and secondary vocational schools, including 325 university textbooks. Together with the 281 kinds of Soviet higher and secondary vocational school textbooks published before the end of 1953, the total was 736 kinds. Most schools have formulated concrete long-term plans for training teachers in accordance with the unified teaching plan. The Ministry stipulated four ways to train teachers: First, sending students and graduate students to study in the Soviet Union. Second, relying on schools with experts to train graduate students, teaching assistants, and teachers. Third, selecting teachers from the school to go to other schools for advanced studies. Fourth, each school trains its own teaching assistants. Since the conference of comprehensive universities in 1953 advocated carrying out scientific research work, the scientific research work of various schools has been gradually launched. (3) There have also been many improvements in work style.
　　However, an examination of the work over the past year reveals that there are still many shortcomings and problems, the most central of which is a serious deviation in implementing the Central Committee's policy of "improving quality and advancing steadily." When formulating and implementing cadre training plans, one-sided emphasis was placed on the need for quantity without seriously paying attention to how to ensure quality. Another serious shortcoming in leadership is that the understanding of improving quality is also subjective and one-sided. This is primarily manifested in the lack of sufficient research and deep understanding when learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In recent years, due to the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts and the active efforts of all teachers, great achievements have been made in teaching reform, which should be affirmed. However, due to the failure of the leadership to correctly apply the spirit and principles of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in light of the teacher strength, student level, equipment conditions, length of study, and unbalanced development of universities in our country, the requirements in some tasks are inevitably too high and the steps are somewhat too hasty. The subjective one-sidedness in understanding the improvement of quality is also manifested in the insufficient understanding of the educational policy of all-round development and the relaxation of simultaneously strengthening political and ideological education and health education in conjunction with professional education.
　　In recent years, teachers have made great progress in their thinking and have been conscientious in their work, which should be affirmed. The current problem is that ideological remolding has only drawn a clear line between ourselves and the enemy politically, and has not yet further launched criticism and self-criticism of bourgeois ideology in academics. Many teachers are still unable to consciously combine their teaching tasks with the country's political tasks, and are still unable to bear the educational responsibility for the all-round development of students.
　　According to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, the guiding principle for higher education work in 1955 should be to take the task of improving the quality of education and earnestly implementing the educational policy of all-round development as the central task. At the same time, efforts should be made to ensure that the construction layout of higher education and secondary vocational education is adapted to national defense construction and economic construction, rationally deployed, and gradually readjusted the departments and specialties to align with requirements, so as to reduce the blindness of cadre training plans. In order to better implement these two tasks, it is necessary to further study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, correctly combine it with China's actual conditions, and correct some important shortcomings that have occurred in teaching reform. It is necessary to strengthen ideological work and improve the health of teachers and students. It is necessary to implement the policy of overall arrangement and rational deployment. It is also necessary to vigorously strengthen investigation and research work, correct the ideological style of subjectivism and bureaucracy, and act in the spirit of proceeding from reality.
　　Based on the above guiding principles, the key points of this year's work are determined as follows:
　　(A) On implementing teaching reform and improving quality:
　　Earnestly implement the educational policy of all-round development, and criticize bourgeois educational ideas that neglect political and ideological education and student health. Special attention should be paid to strengthening patriotism education, communist morality education, and health education among students. It is necessary to effectively improve the organization and leadership of political theory course teaching. Schools should establish a regular system for studying current events and policies. Through various teaching methods and necessary extracurricular activities, strengthen the communist morality education of students, and cultivate students' excellent qualities such as love for their major, love for labor, love for the collective, observance of discipline, care for public property, honesty, respect for teachers, unity and friendship, and simple and clean living. Strengthen leadership over school sports work.
　　Comprehensively and deeply study the experience of Soviet higher education construction, and correctly apply it in combination with the conditions of teachers, students, textbooks, equipment, length of study, and imbalances of various universities in our country. Effective measures must be taken to address the current problem of excessive learning burden for students in universities and secondary vocational schools, and the relevant instructions of the Ministry must be implemented to quickly resolve it. In addition, it is necessary to adapt to the steps of reforming the school system and increasing military training courses, and review and revise the current four-year unified teaching plan and transitional teaching plan, as well as the unified teaching syllabus.
　　It is necessary to absorb the existing experience of various schools and further study specific methods to help teachers strengthen ideological remolding, strengthen the study of materialism, Marxism-Leninism, and current events and policies, so as to gradually carry out academic ideological criticism in conjunction with teaching and scientific research, and improve their political and professional level. Give full play to the role of Soviet experts and Chinese experts in training teachers, allocate sufficient graduate students, and gradually make graduate students from formal studies the main source of new talent. In the work of improving existing teachers, schools should especially focus on teachers with solid academic foundations, and systematically provide strong assistance in politics, professional skills, and ideological style, so that they can become the backbone of teaching and lead all teachers forward.
　　It is necessary to guide school teachers to carry out scientific research work in a planned, focused, and step-by-step manner in conjunction with teaching and the needs of national construction, using academic ideological criticism as a weapon.
　　Gradually change the university system, first gradually changing higher engineering schools and comprehensive universities to a five-year system. Depending on the needs of national construction, other types of schools will generally maintain the original system, and some individual schools will experiment with it. According to the instructions of the State Council, special courses should be discontinued as soon as possible, and the enrollment tasks for special courses should be reduced starting this year. Vigorously strengthen the leadership of secondary vocational education.
　　Improve enrollment work and improve the quality of enrollment. It is necessary to ensure political quality, improve the cultural admission level, and strictly check the body.
　　Conduct education on the struggle to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries among all teachers and students. Strengthen labor discipline and study discipline.
　　(B) On the rational deployment, overall arrangement, and readjustment of departments and specialties:
　　In accordance with the requirements of the new economic regional plan, the new urban plan, and national defense deployment, readjust the establishment and distribution of universities and secondary vocational schools, gradually change the current phenomenon of excessive concentration in a few large cities, especially coastal cities, gradually strengthen the construction of various types of schools in inland and ethnic minority areas, and appropriately reduce the development scale of some schools in the current planned plans. Rationally adjust the establishment and development ratio of various majors, as well as the ratio of higher and secondary vocational cadre training.
　　Earnestly follow the Central Committee's policy of increasing production and practicing economy, and give full play to the potential of existing human and material resources to ensure the completion of the plan. It is necessary to strengthen capital construction and financial management, and implement the policy of streamlining, saving, and ensuring teaching. Old school buildings should be fully utilized, the utilization rate of classrooms and laboratories should be improved, and unnecessary expansions should be strictly controlled. New school buildings should be practical and economical, and extravagance and waste should be opposed. It is necessary to give full play to the utilization rate of teaching equipment, clear backlogs, and correct improper use.
　　(C) On improving the leadership style: In order to better fulfill the guiding principles of work in 1955 and do a good job in the above-mentioned tasks, it is first necessary to resolutely correct decentralism. Correct subjectivism and bureaucracy, and vigorously improve working methods and working style. Strengthen the relationship between superiors and subordinates, and strengthen ties with various schools.

　　高等教育部一九五四年的工作总结和一九五五年的工作要点（摘要）
　　（一九五五年八月五日国务院全体会议第十七次会议批准）
    一九五四年高等教育工作，在一九五三年的基础上有了进一步的发展与改进。（一）比较顺利地完成了招生计划，实际到校新生有九万二千六百零九人，总计在校学生达到二十五万八千三百九十一人，较一九五三—一九五四学年初的在校学生增加了百分之十九点二。一九五四—一九五五学年初工农成分新生数占新生总数百分之三十六点七四，新生中党团员占新生总数百分之五十。（二）在全面地系统地学习苏联先进经验，进一步贯彻教学改革方面，取得了较显著的成就。一年中制定了工科、理科、文科、农科、医科和财经、法律等七科共一百七十三个专业的统一教学计划和中等专业学校工、农、医、财经各科共一百五十九个专业的教学计划，改变了过去各校同一专业而课程门类、教学进度、教学时数、排课顺序、教学方式等不同，以致培养人材的规格不一致的混乱现象。一九五四年高等教育出版社同其他专业出版社共出版了苏联高等学校及中等专业学校教材四百五十五种，其中高等学校教材三百二十五种，连一九五三年年底以前出版的苏联高等和中等专业学校教材二百八十一种，合计为七百三十六种。各校大都按照统一教学计划制定了较长时期的具体的师资培养计划。本部规定培养师资的办法有四种：一是派遣留学生和研究生到苏联学习。二是依靠有专家的学校培养研究生、助教和教师。三是选送本校教师到外校进修。四是各校自己培养助教。自一九五三年在综合大学会议上提倡进行科学研究工作以后，各校科学研究工作已陆续有所开展。（三）在工作作风上，也有不少改进。
    但检查一年来的工作，还存在着很多缺点和问题，其中最中心的一个缺点，是执行中央“提高质量，稳步前进”的方针有严重偏差。拟订和实行培养干部计划时，片面地强调了数量需要，而没有严肃注意如何保证质量。领导中的又一严重缺点是对提高质量的了解也带有主观片面性。这首先表现在学习苏联先进经验时，研究不够，体会不深。几年来由于苏联专家的热诚帮助和全体教师们的积极努力，在教学改革方面获得了很大的成绩，这是应该肯定的。但由于领导方面未能针对我国高等学校的师资力量、学生水平、设备条件、学习年限及其发展的不平衡性等情况，将苏联先进经验的精神原则加以正确运用，在有些工作上要求不免偏高，步骤有些偏急。对提高质量的了解上的主观片面性，也表现在对全面发展的教育方针认识不足，放松了结合专业教育同时加强政治思想教育和健康教育。
    几年来，教师在思想上有了很大的进步，在工作上是尽职尽责的，这一点应该肯定。目前所存在的问题，是思想改造还只是在政治上划清了敌我界限，尚未进一步在学术上对资产阶级思想开展批评和自我批评，许多教师还不能把自己的教学任务与国家的政治任务自觉地结合起来，还不能对学生负起全面发展的教育责任。
    根据中共中央和国务院的指示，一九五五年高等教育工作的指导方针，首应以提高教育质量切实贯彻全面发展的教育方针为中心任务。同时，应力求高等教育和中等专业教育的建设布局与国防建设和经济建设相适应，加以合理部署，逐步地重新调整院系专业，对正口径，以减少培养干部计划的盲目性。为了能很好地执行这两个任务，必须进一步地学习苏联先进经验，并正确地结合中国实际情况，改正教学改革中所发生一些重要缺点。必须加强思想工作和增进师生健康的工作。必须贯彻全面安排、合理部署的方针。并必须大力加强调查研究工作，纠正主观主义和官僚主义的思想作风，本着从实际出发的精神办事。
    根据上述指导方针，确定今年工作要点如左：
      （甲）关于贯彻教学改革，提高质量方面的工作：
    切实贯彻全面发展的教育方针，批判忽视政治思想教育和学生健康的资产阶级教育思想。要特别注意在学生中加强爱国主义教育、共产主义道德教育和健康教育。要切实改进政治理论课教学的组织和领导。各校应建立时事政策学习的经常制度。通过各种教学方式和必要的课外活动，加强对学生的共产主义道德教育，培养学生热爱专业、热爱劳动、热爱集体、遵守纪律、爱护公物、忠诚老实、尊敬师长、团结友爱、生活朴素整洁等优良品质。加强对学校体育工作的领导。
    全面地、深入地钻研苏联高等教育建设的经验，切实结合我国各高等学校的师资、学生、教材、设备、年限和不平衡性等条件，加以正确运用。对目前高等学校和中等专业学校学生学习负担过重问题，必须采取有效措施，贯彻本部有关的指示，迅速加以解决。并要适应着改革学制的步骤和增加军事训练课程的要求，对现行四年制的统一教学计划和过渡性教学计划，以及统一教学大纲等，加以审查修订。
    必须吸收各校已有的经验，进一步研究帮助教师加强思想改造，加强唯物论、马克思列宁主义和时事政策学习的具体作法，以便结合教学，结合科学研究，逐步开展学术思想批判工作，提高其政治和业务水平。充分发挥苏联专家和中国专家培养师资的作用，配备足够的研究生，逐步作到以正规学习的研究生为培养新生力量的主要来源。对原有教师的提高工作，各校应特别着重从学有根柢的教师当中，有计划地在政治、业务和思想作风等方面给以大力帮助，使其能成为教学骨干，带动全体教师前进。
    必须有计划、有重点、有步骤地指导学校教师结合教学，结合国家建设需要，以学术思想批判为武器，开展科学研究工作。
    逐步改变高等学校学制，首先将高等工科学校和综合大学逐步改为五年制，视国家建设要求，其他各类学校一般仍维原制，有的个别试行。根据国务院指示，专修科应及早停办，从今年起就减少专修科招生任务。大力加强中等专业教育的领导。
    改进招生工作，提高招生质量。要保证政治质量，提高文化录取水平，严格检查身体。
    在全体教师和学生中进行关于肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子的斗争的教育。加强劳动纪律和学习纪律。
    （乙）关于合理部署、全面安排、重新调整院系专业方面的问题：
    根据新的经济区域规划、新的城市规划和国防部署的要求，重新调整高等学校和中等专业学校的设置和分布，逐步改变目前过于集中少数大城市尤其是沿海大城市的现象，逐步加强内地和少数民族地区各类学校的建设，并适当减缩现拟计划中某些学校的发展规模。合理调整各专业的设置和发展比例，以及高等和中等专业培养干部的比例。
    切实遵行中央增产节约的方针，充分发挥现有人力、物力的潜在力量，以保证计划的完成。必须加强基本建设和财务管理工作，贯彻精简节约、保证教学的方针。应充分利用旧校舍，提高教室和实验室的利用率，严格控制不急需的扩建，新建校舍以适用、经济为原则，反对铺张浪费。要充分发挥教学设备的利用率，清理积压，纠正使用不当现象。
      （丙）关于改进领导作风方面的问题：为了能很好地履行一九五五年的工作指导方针，做好上述几项工作，首先必须坚决纠正分散主义。纠正主观主义和官僚主义，大力改进工作方法和工作作风。密切上下关系，加强同各校的联系。
