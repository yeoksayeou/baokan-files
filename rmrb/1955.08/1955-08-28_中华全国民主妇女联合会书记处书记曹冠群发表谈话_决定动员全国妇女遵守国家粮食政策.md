Xinhua News Agency, August 26th. Cao Guanqun, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation, told our reporter today that the State Council's "Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" and "Provisional Measures for Rationed Grain Supply in Towns and Cities" are of great significance for further enhancing farmers' enthusiasm for production, increasing grain production, advocating grain conservation, and ensuring grain supply to urban and rural people. We wholeheartedly support them and will mobilize women nationwide to actively abide by the provisions in these two measures, carry out conservation, and eliminate grain waste.

Cao Guanqun said that in the past, women across the country have played an active role in selling surplus grain, especially in conserving grain and verifying household grain consumption, and many model figures have emerged. However, some women still have the idea of wanting to buy more, store more, spend generously even when resources are tight, and dislike the trouble of rationed supply. The phenomenon of grain waste has not been completely eliminated. To this end, democratic women's federations at all levels, down to the grassroots women's representative conferences, must assist people's committees at all levels in conducting in-depth publicity and education among women, introducing typical experiences to inspire women to consciously abide by the state's grain supply system, and make women clearly recognize that saving grain is of great significance to building socialism. At the same time, saving grain saves household expenses, which is also beneficial to themselves.

Cao Guanqun said: Abiding by the state's grain policy and saving grain is an important part of women's good housekeeping. She pointed out that women nationwide should do the following three things in this regard:

First, urban women should determine the amount of grain needed for the whole family based on the different ages of the family members and the intensity of their labor, in accordance with the rationing standards, and make a household grain consumption plan to avoid overbuying grain. Women in rural households short of grain should, according to local grain consumption standards and the principle of supplying what the state has and supplying when there is a shortage, avoid exaggerating reports and buying grain early.

Second, the vast number of working women in rural areas should actively engage in grain production, increase yield per unit area, strive for increased production year after year, and pay attention to careful harvesting, threshing, and storage to reduce grain loss and strive for every grain to return home; try to collect wild vegetables and other substitute feed to feed pigs and chickens, and save grain. All housewives in urban and rural areas must use their brains, calculate carefully, avoid throwing away rice and flour, avoid wasting a grain of grain, and pay attention to studying cooking methods, processing coarse grains finely, increasing the rice yield, advocating mutual exchange of experience, promoting the spirit of mutual assistance, and striving to save grain.

Third, all women must keep their eyes open, raise their vigilance, assist the government, expose all activities of hidden counter-revolutionaries who sabotage the grain policy, and resolutely fight against all bad people and bad deeds that violate the grain policy. Let us unite with the people of the whole country, strictly abide by state laws, obey state plans, and redouble our efforts to increase grain production and save grain, and excellently complete our glorious tasks.

　　中华全国民主妇女联合会书记处书记曹冠群发表谈话
　　决定动员全国妇女遵守国家粮食政策
    新华社二十六日讯　中华全国民主妇女联合会书记处书记曹冠群今天对本社记者说，国务院公布的“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”和“市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”，对于进一步提高农民生产积极性，增加粮食生产，提倡粮食节约，保证对城乡人民的粮食供应，都有重大意义。我们衷心地拥护，并要动员全国妇女积极遵守这两项办法中的规定，开展节约，消除粮食浪费现象。
    曹冠群说，全国妇女过去在出卖余粮，特别在节约粮食、核实家庭用粮方面，发挥了积极的作用，涌现了不少模范人物。但是在有些妇女中还存在着想多买、多存、宽打窄用、嫌定量供应麻烦的思想，粮食浪费现象也还没有完全消除。为此，各级民主妇联组织，直至基层妇女代表会，必须协助各级人民委员会对妇女群众进行深入的宣传教育工作，通过介绍典型经验，启发妇女们自觉地遵守国家的粮食供应制度，使妇女们明确认识节约粮食对建设社会主义具有重大意义，同时，节约粮食就节省了家庭开支，对自己也有利。
    曹冠群说：遵守国家粮食政策、节约粮食是妇女们管好家务的重要内容。她指出全国妇女在这方面应做好以下三件工作：
    第一，城市妇女们应根据全家人口的不同年龄、从事劳动的轻重程度，按照定量标准，核定全家用粮数量，订好家庭用粮计划，做到不超买粮食。农村缺粮户的妇女，应根据当地的用粮标准，并根据国家有什么供应什么以及何时缺何时供应的原则，做到不浮报、不早买。
    第二，广大农村的劳动妇女，应当积极从事粮食生产，提高单位面积产量，争取年年增产，并注意细收、细打、细藏，减少粮食损耗，争取颗粒还家；尽量采集野菜等代饲品喂猪喂鸡，节约粮食。城乡的全体家庭妇女都必须开动脑筋，精打细算，不抛米撒面，不浪费一粒粮食，并注意研究做饭方法，粗粮细作，提高出饭率，提倡相互交流经验，发扬相互协助的精神，努力节约粮食。
    第三，全体妇女都要擦亮眼睛、提高警惕，协助政府，揭发各种暗藏的反革命分子破坏粮食政策的一切活动，坚决和一切违犯粮食政策的坏人坏事作斗争。让我们大家同全国人民团结一致，严格遵守国家法令，服从国家计划，为增产粮食、节约粮食而加倍努力，出色地完成我们的光荣任务。
