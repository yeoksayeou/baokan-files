    Curb the Grave Actions of the Syngman Rhee Clique in Undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement
    At a time when the international situation has seen some relaxation due to the efforts of relevant parties, a serious action aimed at directly undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement has occurred in South Korea. On August 1, the Syngman Rhee clique issued a provocative statement, openly announcing its preparation to seize the area north of the Military Demarcation Line and south of the 38th Parallel; subsequently, on August 5, it issued a notice to the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, demanding that all personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission stationed in South Korea withdraw by 24:00 on August 13. In recent days, the Syngman Rhee clique has also instigated its plainclothes agents and reactionary groups to create riots at ports where Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission inspection teams are performing their duties, surrounding and attacking Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission personnel, and clamoring to "drive out" the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from South Korea. The Syngman Rhee clique's hostile attitude towards the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its attempt to directly undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement are serious. All countries and people who desire peace in Korea should pay close attention, and relevant countries should not ignore it.
    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued statements on August 11 respectively, regarding the South Korean authorities' attempt to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement. The statements emphasized the serious danger contained in this behavior, demanded that the United States and the governments of countries related to the United Nations Command fulfill the international obligations stipulated in the armistice agreement, ensure the safety and work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and advocated that all foreign troops withdraw from Korea so that the Korean people can peacefully resolve the issue of Korean reunification themselves.
    For the two years since the Korean armistice, the Syngman Rhee clique in South Korea has single-mindedly opposed a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue, attempting to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement and reignite the war. The Syngman Rhee clique's intention to undermine the armistice is particularly evident in its desperate expansion of its own army. The number of troops in South Korea has increased from sixteen divisions at the time of the armistice to twenty-one divisions, and thirteen reserve divisions are also being established. The Syngman Rhee clique has never concealed its bellicose attitude, constantly issuing various calls from Seoul to undermine the armistice agreement and launch an armed "northward advance." They openly regard the Korean armistice as an "expediency" and a "regrettable great mistake." The Syngman Rhee clique has repeatedly clamored to expel the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's inspection teams from South Korea and abolish the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The Syngman Rhee clique's activities to undermine the armistice agreement have seriously hindered the effective implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and have repeatedly endangered the armistice. It is extremely clear that the Syngman Rhee clique's urgent desire to undermine the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is a preparation for re-igniting the war. Therefore, if the Syngman Rhee clique's threats and harmful actions against the safety and work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission are not curbed, it will cause serious damage to the Korean armistice and peace in Korea.
    It is not accidental that the Syngman Rhee clique has chosen this time to intensify its threats to undermine the armistice agreement, undermine the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and incite riots in South Korea. Since the success of the Geneva Four-Power Summit, the international situation has generally eased, and a good start has been made in international consultations to resolve international issues in a spirit of cooperation and understanding. At this time, the Syngman Rhee clique's new serious actions threatening the Korean armistice are a major conspiracy by certain forces in the international arena to continue creating tension and undermining the atmosphere of peaceful consultation. United Press International reported on the South Korean riots on the 8th, also admitting: "This disturbance was carefully timed."
    The Syngman Rhee clique's attempt to undermine the Korean armistice and threaten the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission violates the wishes of people all over the world and the interests of world peace, and therefore naturally arouses the indignation of all countries that desire peace in Korea and peace-loving people all over the world. Even some countries related to the United Nations Command have expressed dissatisfaction with this behavior of the Syngman Rhee clique. A British Foreign Office spokesman has formally stated that Britain believes that the Syngman Rhee clique's opposition to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission "has a more serious significance," and pointed out that the United Nations Command has a responsibility to protect the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and that the armistice agreement should be observed. The Swedish government newspaper "Dagens Nyheter," one of the countries composing the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission responsible for the Korean armistice, uneasily pointed out: "South Korea's efforts to end the committee's activities by force may re-ignite the threat of armed conflict in Korea." According to United Press International, Swedish sources close to the government stated that Sweden does not intend to withdraw its personnel participating in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. According to United Press International, Switzerland, another member of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, also refuses to completely abolish the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.
    The Korean Armistice Agreement is a solemn international agreement, and all countries and people who desire peace in Korea demand that it be strictly observed. The Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission was established in accordance with the Korean Armistice Agreement, and its responsibility is to supervise the implementation of the armistice agreement and ensure the stability of the Korean armistice. For two years, the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, although frequently obstructed and threatened by the Syngman Rhee clique in the execution of its mission, has played a positive role in the implementation of the armistice agreement and the maintenance of the Korean armistice. The establishment of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is a very important part of the Korean Armistice Agreement and must not be allowed to be undermined by the Syngman Rhee clique!
    The United States, as the party representing the United Nations Command in signing the Korean Armistice Agreement, has an unshirkable responsibility to curb the Syngman Rhee clique's provocative actions of undermining the armistice agreement and threatening the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The U.S. State Department spokesman also admitted in a statement to reporters on the 9th: "The United States has an obligation to abide by the terms of the armistice agreement, including the protection of the personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission." In this case, the United States should immediately take effective action to curb the increasingly serious threatening behavior of the Syngman Rhee clique, ensure the safety of all institutions and personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission stationed in South Korea, and ensure that they can smoothly perform their tasks.
    The events in South Korea once again prove that the Korean armistice is still unstable and is constantly threatened by the Syngman Rhee clique's challenging behavior. Therefore, as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China pointed out in its statement on the 11th: "Consolidating the Korean armistice and further seeking the peaceful reunification of Korea is a necessary factor in easing the tension in the Far East." The key to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, with relevant countries guaranteeing the peaceful development of Korea, allowing the Korean people to realize the peaceful reunification of Korea according to their own wishes. Striving for the peaceful reunification of Korea is the most urgent and unanimous desire of the Korean people at present. Anyone who disregards this is disregarding the greatest interests of the Korean people.
    The Korean-Chinese side has always abided by the Korean Armistice Agreement. The Korean-Chinese side and the Soviet Union made great efforts at the Geneva Conference last year to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, which was unanimously praised by peace-loving people all over the world. After the Geneva Conference, the Korean-Chinese side and the Soviet Union continued to make unremitting efforts to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The withdrawal of thirteen divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea is a convincing testament to the peaceful sincerity of the Chinese people. The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China pointed out: "We have reason to demand that certain countries no longer insist on keeping foreign troops in Korea." The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has put forward a series of proposals to promote contact between the North and South of Korea conducive to peaceful reunification. However, these efforts have not received the response they deserve. The facts are very clear that if the Korean issue is to be resolved peacefully and the peaceful reunification desired by the Korean people is to be realized, both sides of the armistice must show sincerity and earnestly implement the Korean Armistice Agreement.
    The statements of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea timely remind the people of the world to pay attention to the serious situation currently developing in Korea due to the destructive activities of the Syngman Rhee clique. This solemn warning should attract the attention of all peace-loving people. The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China said: "The state of armistice in Korea must be consolidated, and no one is allowed to undermine it. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission must be respected by both sides of the armistice, and no one is allowed to threaten it. Relevant countries should hold a Far East conference with broad participation of Asian countries to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue." The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea also said: "The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that the Korean issue must be resolved peacefully and hopes that the governments of relevant countries will convene a Far East conference with broad participation of Asian countries to seek ways to withdraw foreign troops from Korea and peacefully resolve the Korean issue." This position of the two statements is the only correct position to take on the current Korean situation. Those who are truly concerned about the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue should demand the immediate cessation of the Syngman Rhee clique's serious actions to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement, and demand that relevant countries, with the participation of Asian countries, sit down and, in the spirit of cooperation and mutual understanding shown at the Four-Power Summit, negotiate a resolution to the Korean issue and eliminate an explosive factor in the unstable situation in the Far East.

### 制止李承晚集团破坏朝鲜停战协定的严重行动

    制止李承晚集团破坏朝鲜停战协定的严重行动
    当目前国际形势由于有关各方的努力，而有了一些和缓的时候，在南朝鲜却发生了企图直接破坏朝鲜停战协定的严重行动。李承晚集团在八月一日发表挑衅性的声明，公开宣布准备夺取军事分界线以北、三八线以南的地区；随后又在八月五日向朝鲜中立国监察委员会发出一项通知，要求中立国监察委员会驻在南朝鲜的人员在八月十三日二十四时前全部撤走。连日来李承晚集团并指使它的便衣特务和反动团体，在有中立国监察委员会视察小组执行任务的口岸，制造暴乱，包围和攻击中立国监察委员会人员，扬言要把中立国监察委员会“赶出”南朝鲜。李承晚集团这种敌视中立国监察委员会、企图直接破坏朝鲜停战协定的情况是严重的，一切愿望朝鲜和平的国家和人民都应该密切注意，有关各国尤不应置之不理。
    我国外交部和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省在十一日分别就南朝鲜当局企图破坏朝鲜停战协定的行为发表声明，着重指出这种行为所包含的严重危险，要求美国和联合国军有关各国政府负起停战协定规定的国际义务，保证中立国监察委员会的安全和工作，并主张一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，以便朝鲜人民能够自己和平解决朝鲜的统一问题。
    朝鲜停战两年来，南朝鲜李承晚集团一味反对朝鲜问题和平解决，力图破坏朝鲜停战协定，重新发动战争。李承晚集团破坏停战的打算，特别明显的表现在它拚命扩充自己的军队方面。现在南朝鲜的军队，已从停战时的十六个师增加到二十一个师，还在建立十三个后备师。李承晚集团从来不掩饰他们的这种好战态度，他们不断地从汉城发出各种要破坏停战协定和发动武装“北进”的叫嚷。他们公开地把朝鲜的停战看成是“权宜之计”和“不幸的大错误”。李承晚集团曾不断地扬言要把中立国监察委员会的视察小组驱逐出南朝鲜，取消中立国监察委员会的工作。李承晚集团的破坏停战协定的活动，严重地妨碍了朝鲜停战协定的有效实施，曾经多次使停战遭到危险。李承晚集团这样急迫的要破坏中立国监察委员会的工作，是重新挑起战争的准备。因此，目前如果不制止李承晚集团对中立国监察委员会的安全和工作的威胁和危害行动，就会给朝鲜的停战和朝鲜的和平带来严重的损害，这是异常清楚的。
    李承晚集团选择这个时候变本加厉地威胁要破坏停战协定，破坏中立国监察委员会的工作，在南朝鲜挑动暴乱，绝不是偶然的。自日内瓦四国政府首脑会议获得成就以来，国际局势有了普遍的缓和，国际上以合作和谅解的精神来协商解决国际问题已经有了一个良好的开端。李承晚集团在这个时候采取威胁朝鲜停战的新的严重行动，正是国际上某些势力企图继续制造紧张局势和破坏和平协商气氛的一个重大阴谋。美国国际新闻社八日报道南朝鲜的暴乱事件时也承认：“这种骚动是审慎地选好时机进行的。”
    李承晚集团这种企图破坏朝鲜停战、威胁中立国监察委员会的行为，违反全世界人民的愿望和世界和平的利益，因此自然地激起了一切愿望朝鲜和平的国家和全世界爱好和平人民的愤慨。就是和联合国军方面有关的一些国家，也对李承晚集团这种行为表示不满。英国外交部发言人已经正式表示，英国认为李承晚集团这次反对中立国监察委员会的行为“具有更严重的意义”，并指出联合国军总司令部有责任保护中立国监察委员会，停战协定应该得到遵守。对朝鲜停战负有责任的中立国监察委员会的组成国家之一的瑞典的政府机关报“晨报”，曾不安地指出：“南朝鲜打算以暴力来结束委员会的活动的努力可能重新引起朝鲜发生武装冲突的威胁。”据美国合众社报道，瑞典接近政府人士表示，瑞典不打算撤退它参加中立国监察委员会的人员。据美国国际新闻社报道，另一个中立国监察委员会的成员国瑞士也拒绝完全废除中立国监察委员会的工作。
    朝鲜停战协定是庄严的国际协定，所有愿意朝鲜和平的国家和人民都要求严格地遵守它。朝鲜中立国监察委员会是根据朝鲜停战协定成立的，它的责任是监察停战协定的实施，保障朝鲜停战的稳定。两年来，朝鲜中立国监察委员会在执行其任务中，虽然经常遭到李承晚集团的阻挠和威胁，但是对于停战协定的实施和朝鲜停战的维持起了积极的作用。在朝鲜停战协定中，中立国监察委员会的设置是很重要的一部分，决不能容许李承晚集团加以破坏！
    美国是代表联合国军在朝鲜停战协定上签字的一方，它负有制止李承晚集团破坏停战协定和威胁中立国监察委员会的挑衅行为的无可推卸的责任。美国国务院发言人九日向记者发表的声明中也承认：“美国有义务遵守停战协定的条款，其中包括保护中立国监察委员会人员在内。”既然如此美国应该立即采取有效行动，制止李承晚集团日益严重的威胁行为，使驻在南朝鲜的中立国监察委员会的一切机构和人员的安全得到应有的保障，并保证他们能够顺利的执行其任务。
    南朝鲜发生的事件再一次证明，朝鲜的停战还是不稳定的，它经常遭受着李承晚集团挑战行为的威胁。因而正如我国外交部在十一日的声明中所指出的：“巩固朝鲜停战，并进一步谋求朝鲜的和平统一，是和缓远东紧张局势的一个必要因素。”而和平解决朝鲜问题的关键，是从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队，有关国家保证朝鲜的和平发展，让朝鲜人民根据他们自己的意愿，实现朝鲜的和平统一。争取朝鲜的和平统一，是朝鲜人民目前最迫切的一致愿望。谁不顾到这一点，就是漠视朝鲜人民的最大利益。
    朝中方面始终遵守着朝鲜停战协定。朝中两国和苏联为使朝鲜问题得到和平解决，在去年举行的日内瓦会议上作了重大的努力，得到了全世界爱好和平人民的一致赞扬。在日内瓦会议以后，朝中两国和苏联仍然为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决进行了不断的努力。中国人民志愿军十三个师已经从朝鲜撤出，是我国人民和平诚意的令人信服的明证。我国外交部声明指出：“我们有理由要求某些国家不再坚持把外国军队留在朝鲜。”朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为促进朝鲜南北双方之间有利于和平统一的联系，曾提出了一系列的建议。但是，这些努力也没有得到应得的反应。事实非常明显，要使朝鲜问题和平解决，要使朝鲜人民所渴望的和平统一得以实现，必须停战双方都表现诚意，切实履行朝鲜停战协定。
    我国外交部和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省的声明适时地提起全世界人民注意目前由于李承晚集团的破坏活动而在朝鲜发展起来的严重形势，这一严正的警告应该引起一切爱好和平人民的注意。我国外交部的声明中说：“朝鲜停战状态必须巩固，不容许任何人加以破坏。中立国监察委员会必须受到停战双方的尊重，不容许任何人加以威胁。有关国家应该举行一次有亚洲国家广泛参加的远东会议，来谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决。”朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省的声明中也说：“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为朝鲜问题必须和平解决，并希望有关各国政府召开有亚洲国家广泛参加的远东会议谋求从朝鲜撤退外国军队和和平解决朝鲜问题的途径。”这两个声明的这个立场是对待目前朝鲜局势的唯一正确的立场，真正关心朝鲜问题的和平解决的人，都应当要求立即制止李承晚集团破坏朝鲜停战协定的严重行为，并要求有关国家在有亚洲国家参加下坐下来按照四大国首脑会议所表现的合作和相互谅解的精神，协商解决朝鲜问题，消除远东方面局势不稳定的一个具有爆炸性的因素。
