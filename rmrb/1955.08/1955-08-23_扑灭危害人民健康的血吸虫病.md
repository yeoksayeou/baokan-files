Eradicating Schistosomiasis, a Disease Harmful to People's Health
　　Yin Yi
　　Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that seriously endangers people's health, affects agricultural labor production, and impacts national economic construction. This disease is prevalent in many countries around the world, and it also has a long history of prevalence in China. It is said that during the Taiping Rebellion period, it was discovered in Hunan and Anhui provinces in the Yangtze River basin. Before liberation, due to long-term reactionary rule, the people lived in extreme poverty, and urban and rural sanitation was extremely poor. Schistosomiasis was able to spread and grow, so that today it still has varying degrees of prevalence in more than 200 counties in 12 provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan. In severely affected areas, patients suffer from stunted development, decreased reproductive function, and a gradual decrease in population, and the labor force is severely damaged.
　　Since liberation, the Party and the People's Government have actively carried out the prevention and control of schistosomiasis. Health, agriculture, water conservancy, and other departments, as well as Party and government organs at all levels in schistosomiasis-affected areas, have conducted investigations and research into the factors contributing to the spread of schistosomiasis and the affected areas, and have initially grasped the basic situation related to schistosomiasis. They have carried out health propaganda and education on the prevention and control of schistosomiasis among the masses in the affected areas, enabling the masses to have a preliminary understanding of the harm and prevention methods of schistosomiasis, eliminating fear and reversing pessimistic and despairing emotions. At the same time, 16 prevention and control centers, 78 prevention and control stations, and 420 prevention and control teams have been established successively in the affected areas, various simple and easy-to-implement preventive measures have been promoted, and research on prevention and control methods has been carried out. However, due to a lack of experience in this work, a lack of clear prevention and control guidelines and unified prevention and control plans, and a failure to fully mobilize the masses and mobilize social medical forces, and a failure to organize agricultural, water conservancy, democratic women's federations, trade unions, and other relevant agencies to closely cooperate with mass organizations, although some experience has been gained in recent years, approximately 140,000 schistosomiasis patients have been treated, and the sanitary conditions in the affected areas have been improved, it has not been possible to fundamentally control the spread of schistosomiasis, and there are still signs of continued spread in some areas.
　　Schistosomiasis is commonly called "water belly disease" or "big belly disease" by ordinary people. It is caused by a parasitic worm—the schistosome—developing in the blood vessels of the human or animal body. When schistosome eggs are excreted with the patient's feces, due to natural or man-made reasons, feces containing eggs have many opportunities to flow into rivers, ponds, lakes, and marshes. Once the eggs encounter water, they immediately hatch into miracidia in the water, and then burrow into the body of the Oncomelania hupensis snail for further development and reproduction, gradually growing into countless cercariae, which then leave the snail body one after another and swim in the water. Cercariae can only live in the water for three days. Within three days, if cercariae encounter a person, they burrow into the skin, flow along with the blood, circulate to the liver and mesenteric blood vessels to parasitize, absorb human blood, develop and mate to produce eggs, leading to blockage of human blood vessels, enlargement of the liver and spleen, accumulation of fluid in the abdomen, and dysfunction of internal organs, until complete loss of labor ability. In the vast areas of the Yangtze River basin and south of the Yangtze River, the climate is mild, there are many rivers, lakes, and harbors, and many weeds grow along the banks, which is very suitable for the survival and reproduction of Oncomelania hupensis snails. At the same time, the Jiangnan region takes rice as the main crop, and people are accustomed to using human waste to fertilize the fields, and there are many opportunities for feces to pollute water sources, which provides extremely convenient conditions for the spread of schistosomiasis.
　　Experience over the years has proved that to control the spread of schistosomiasis and gradually eliminate schistosomiasis, the most fundamental measures are to strictly manage feces, kill schistosome eggs in feces to prevent untreated feces from polluting water sources and giving schistosomiasis a chance to spread; kill Oncomelania hupensis snails, eliminate the intermediate host of schistosomiasis, and eliminate the nests for the development and reproduction of schistosomiasis; control water use to prevent cercariae in water flows in schistosomiasis-affected areas from invading the human or animal body and continuing to spread schistosomiasis; and actively treat patients to restore the health of patients and completely eliminate the source of schistosomiasis infection.
　　Fundamentally controlling and eliminating schistosomiasis is an arduous and complex task. Based on the prevention and control experience over the years and the problems discovered in prevention and control, the following aspects of work should be strengthened at present. First, strengthen health propaganda and education in schistosomiasis-affected areas, and regard carrying out health propaganda and education as the foundation for the prevention and control of schistosomiasis. Health propaganda and education work must be carried out under the leadership of the local Party committee and People's Committee, mobilizing all possible forces, making full use of various methods, and combining with the central work of different periods. Make the masses in the affected areas understand the life history, living conditions, transmission process, and harm of schistosomiasis, as well as the preventable methods that can be achieved during the entire development period of schistosomiasis. The masses must realize that the prevention and control of schistosomiasis is a mass health movement, and victory can only be achieved if everyone takes action. To this end, in schistosomiasis-affected areas, propaganda and education work on the prevention and control of schistosomiasis should be regarded as one of the main contents of the patriotic health movement. In propaganda and education work, attention should be paid to the ideological and scientific nature of the content, and the severity of schistosomiasis should not be exaggerated, so as not to cause fear and pessimism among the masses.
　　Second, further strengthen the research work on schistosomiasis. In the past, medical colleges, universities, and medical science research institutions had divided up the work to conduct various special studies on schistosomiasis, but due to a lack of unified leadership, unified plans, and no clear research goals, the progress of research work has been far from meeting the needs of prevention and control work. Until now, we still lack more ideal and more effective preventive measures and prevention and control drugs. Therefore, it is important to plan and organize medical scientists, pharmacists, chemists, biologists, parasitologists, zoologists, agronomists, water conservancy experts, veterinarians, and hygienists to conduct research from the aspects of improving water conservancy, cultivation, manure storage, fertilization, snail extermination, and traditional Chinese and Western medicine treatment and prevention, and cooperate to solve the various specialized problems in schistosomiasis prevention and control work to improve prevention and control effectiveness. Without research in these areas, it is impossible to fundamentally eliminate schistosomiasis. Future schistosomiasis research work should learn from past lessons, attach importance to the combination of theory and practice, and the combination of laboratories and field sites, especially going deep into the field to study the key problems existing in actual prevention and control work, and widely pay attention to excavating and collecting effective experiences among the masses for research and promotion.
　　Third, strengthen the treatment of schistosomiasis. This is not only to restore patients' health and enable them to participate in production as soon as possible, but also includes the significance of prevention, especially among patients. If early patients cannot receive treatment, they will inevitably develop to the point where they cannot be treated. All localities should give full play to the role of social medical forces and medical institutions at all levels to provide more patients with the opportunity to receive treatment. Local health and medical departments should also actively participate in prevention and control work.
　　Fourth, in order to specifically promote the prevention and control of schistosomiasis, it is also necessary to enrich and establish professional prevention and control institutions, especially in severely affected areas. The prevention and control institutions at the provincial, county, and district levels should be enriched and strengthened as needed. At the same time, prevention and control cadres at all levels should be trained and cultivated to master the prevention and control guidelines, policies, and preventive measures.
　　Schistosomiasis prevention and control work is a complex and arduous task and is a major task for the health department at present. The health department must closely cooperate with agriculture, water conservancy, and other relevant departments and mass organizations under the unified leadership of the Party and the People's Government, and promote various prevention and control measures in a planned, step-by-step, and focused manner according to different situations, different regions, and different seasons, and strive for the final victory in the prevention and control of schistosomiasis.

　　扑灭危害人民健康的血吸虫病
　　尹毅
    血吸虫病是一种严重危害人民身体健康，影响农业劳动生产，影响国家经济建设的寄生虫病。这种病流行在世界的许多国家，在我国也有较久长的流行历史，据说在太平天国年间，在长江流域的湖南、安徽等省即有发现。解放以前，由于长期的反动统治，人民生活极为穷困，城乡卫生状况异常恶劣，血吸虫病得以蔓延滋长，以致至今在江苏、浙江、安徽、江西、湖北、湖南等十二省的二百多县内仍有不同程度的流行。在严重流行地区，患者发育不良，生殖机能减退，人口逐年减少，劳动力受到极严重的摧残。
    解放以后，党和人民政府积极进行了血吸虫病的防治工作。卫生、农业、水利等部门和血吸虫病流行区各级党政机关曾进行了血吸虫病流行因素和流行地区的调查研究工作，初步掌握了有关血吸虫病的基本情况；向流行区群众进行了防治血吸虫病的卫生宣传教育，使群众对血吸虫病的危害性和防治方法有了初步的认识，消除了恐惧心理，扭转了悲观失望情绪；同时，还在流行区先后建立了十六个防治所、七十八个防治站、四百二十个防治小组，推行了各种简单易行的预防措施，并且进行了防治方法的研究。但是，由于对这一工作缺乏经验，缺乏明确的防治方针和统一的防治计划，同时没有充分地发动群众和动员社会医疗力量，没有组织农业、水利、民主妇女联合会、工会等有关机关同群众团体密切配合，因此，几年来虽然取得了一些经验，治疗了约十四万血吸虫病人，改变了流行区的卫生状况，但还没有能够从根本上控制血吸虫病的流行，有些地区仍有继续蔓延的迹象。
    血吸虫病一般人叫作“水臌病”或“大肚子病”，是由一种寄生蠕虫——血吸虫在人体或动物体血管内发育所引起的。当血吸虫卵随着患者的粪便排出后，由于天然的或者人为的原因，带卵的粪便有很多机会流入河塘、湖沼。虫卵一旦遇见了水，立即在水中孵化成为毛蚴，而后钻入钉螺体内进一步发育繁殖，逐渐长成为无数的尾蚴，便陆续离开钉螺体，在水中游动。尾蚴在水中只能生活三天，在三天内，尾蚴遇到人就钻进皮肤，顺着血液，循环流到肝脏和肠系膜的血管寄生，吸取人的血液，发育并交配产卵，以致人的血管阻塞，肝脏、脾脏肿大，腹部发生积水，内脏机能发生障碍，直至完全丧失劳动能力。在长江流域和长江以南广大地区，由于气候温和，河流湖泊港汊很多，而且沿岸又长着许多杂草，极适宜于钉螺生存和繁殖；同时，江南地方以水稻为主要农作物，人们又习惯用人粪肥田，粪便污染水源的机会很多，这就给血吸虫病流行以极便利的条件。
    几年来的经验证明，要控制血吸虫病的流行，逐步消灭血吸虫病，最根本的措施是严格地管理粪便，杀灭粪便中的血吸虫卵，以防止未经处理的粪便污染水源，给血吸虫病以传染的机会；杀灭钉螺，消灭血吸虫的中间宿主，杜绝血吸虫发育繁殖的巢穴；管制用水，防止血吸虫病流行区水流中的尾蚴侵入人体或动物体内继续传染血吸虫病；积极治疗病人，恢复患者的健康，彻底消灭血吸虫病的传染病源。
      从根本上控制和消灭血吸虫病，是一件艰巨而复杂的工作。根据几年来的防治经验和已发现的防治中的问题，目前，应当加强以下几方面的工作。首先，在血吸虫病流行区加强卫生宣传教育工作，把开展卫生宣传教育工作作为防治血吸虫病的基础。卫生宣传教育工作必须在当地党委和人民委员会的领导下，动员一切可能动员的力量，充分利用各种方式，结合不同时期的中心工作进行。使流行区群众了解血吸虫的生活史、生活条件、传染过程和它的危害性，以及血吸虫整个发育期中的可以做到的预防方法。要使群众认识到防治血吸虫病是一种群众性的卫生运动，必须大家动手，才能取得胜利。为此，在血吸虫病流行区，应当把防治血吸虫病的宣传教育工作，当作爱国卫生运动的主要内容之一。在宣传教育工作中，应当注意宣传内容的思想性和科学性，不要夸大血吸虫病的严重性，以免在群众中引起恐惧和悲观情绪。
    其次，要进一步加强血吸虫病的研究工作。过去医学院校、医药科学研究机关曾分工进行关于血吸虫病的各项专题研究，但由于缺乏统一的领导，统一的计划，没有明确的研究目标，以致研究工作的进展还远不能满足防治工作的需要，直到现在，我们还缺乏更理想的和更有效的预防措施和防治药物。因此，有计划地组织和动员医学家、药学家、化学家、生物学家、寄生虫学家、动物学家、农艺学家、水利学家、兽医学家、卫生学家分别从改善水利、耕种、储粪、施肥、灭螺以及中西药物治疗预防等方面进行研究，统一合作来解决血吸虫病防治工作中的各个专门问题，以提高防治功效，这是一项重要的工作。缺少这些方面的研究，要从根本上消灭血吸虫病是不可能的。今后的血吸虫病研究工作，应当吸取过去的教训，重视理论和实际相结合，实验室和现场相结合，特别是应当深入现场，研究实际防治工作存在的关键问题，广泛注意发掘、收集群众中的有效经验进行研究推广。
    第三，加强血吸虫病的治疗工作。这不仅为了恢复病人健康，使患者早日参加生产，而且也包含有预防的意义，特别是在病患者中，早期患者若不能得到治疗，则必然发展到不能治疗的地步。各地应当充分发挥社会医疗力量和各级医疗机构的作用，使更多的病人得到治疗的机会。地方卫生医疗部门也应当积极参加防治工作。
    第四，为了具体推行血吸虫病的防治工作，还必须充实和增设专业防治机构，尤其是在严重流行地区，省、县、区的防治机构，都应根据需要充实和加强。同时，还应当训练和培养各级防治干部，使能掌握防治方针、政策和预防措施。
    血吸虫病防治工作是一个复杂而艰巨的工作，是卫生部门当前的一项重大的任务。卫生部门必须在党和人民政府的统一领导下，跟农业、水利等有关部门、群众团体密切合作，根据不同情况、不同地区、不同季节，有计划、有步骤、有重点地推行各项防治措施，争取防治血吸虫病的最后胜利。
