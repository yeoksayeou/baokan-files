Many Factories in Shanghai and Qingdao Implement Quota Material Usage Methods

Xinhua News Agency:

In Shanghai, cigarette and rubber factories have relatively widely implemented quota material usage methods in the course of carrying out a comprehensive conservation campaign, reducing waste. Some food factories have also begun to implement it.

The local state-owned Dafu Rubber Factory, which implemented the quota material usage method earlier, now calculates the required amount of rubber and other auxiliary materials each month based on the output and the amount of rubber used per pair of rubber shoes. It also strengthens the inspection of semi-finished products during the production process to prevent material usage from exceeding the quota. This not only saves a lot of rubber but also changes the past situation where raw materials were sometimes overstocked and sometimes in short supply. In the past, the state-owned Shanghai Cigarette Factory No. 2 often adopted the method of "adding more at each level" when purchasing tobacco leaves in order to prepare for times when supplies were cut off. After implementing the quota material usage method, tobacco leaves are purchased based on the inventory and the workshop quota material usage standards, which reduces the inventory by two-thirds compared to the first quarter, saving more than one million yuan in working capital. In May, Shanghai Yimin Food Factory No. 4 established consumption quotas for raw materials for various products and established a strict system of quota delivery and material requisition. By the end of July, it had used more than 20,000 jin less flour and lard than the state plan.

Since the Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory's forging workshop implemented the quota material usage system in July of this year, it has improved the workers' care for raw materials and changed the past situation of stockpiling and wasting raw materials, achieving dedicated material for specific purposes, using large materials for large uses, and using small materials for small uses. Surplus materials are immediately recovered and stored by the material group, and different colored markings are applied to the raw materials to facilitate the identification of the quality composition of various materials, so that the quality of the produced parts meets the requirements, and the scrap rate and rework rate are also greatly reduced. The amount of steel raw materials used in the entire workshop has decreased month by month. In July, a total of more than 22,000 kilograms of steel raw materials were saved, and in the first half of August, another 23,000 kilograms were saved.

　　上海青岛许多工厂实行限额用料办法
　　上海市的卷烟工厂和橡胶工厂在开展全面节约运动中，已比较普遍地推行了限额用料的办法，减少了浪费。有些食品工厂也已开始推行。
　　推行限额用料办法较早的地方国营大孚橡胶厂，现在每月根据产量和每双胶鞋用胶量，精确地计算出橡胶和其他辅助材料的需要量，并在生产过程中加强半成品的检验工作，不使用料超过限额，这样不仅节约了许多橡胶，还改变了过去原材料有时大量超储、有时供应脱节的状况。国营上海卷烟二厂过去采购烟叶时，常常采取“层层加码”的方法，以备供应脱节时用；推行限额用料办法后，根据库存量和车间限额用料标准来采购烟叶，就使库存量一般比第一季度减少三分之二，少用了一百多万元的流动资金。上海益民食品四厂五月份订出了各种产品原料的消耗定额，并建立了严格的限额送料、领料制度，到七月底止，已比国家计划少用了两万多斤面粉和猪油。（新华社）
　　青岛四方机车车辆制造工厂锻冶车间，从今年七月起实行限额用料制度以后，提高了职工对于原材料的爱护，改变了过去积压浪费原材料的状况，做到了专料专用，大料大用，小料小用。有余料立即由材料组回收保存，并在原材料上分别涂上不同颜色的标帜，以便于辨别各种材料的质量成份，使制出的配件质量合乎要求，废品和回修率也大大减少。全车间的钢铁原材料使用数量，逐月下降。七月份共节约了钢铁原材料二万二千多公斤，八月上半月又节约了二万三千多公斤。（李鸿起）
