The Ministry of Finance recently formulated and announced the "Measures for Repaying Principal and Interest on 1954 and 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds." The measures are as follows:

    1. These measures are formulated in accordance with Articles 5, 6, and 7 of the Regulations on National Economic Construction Bonds of 1954 and 1955.

    2. The principal of the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds shall be repaid in eight installments from 1955 to 1962; the principal of the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds shall be repaid in ten installments from 1956 to 1965. Except for the final year when the corresponding principal amount is repaid in full without a lottery, a lottery will be held annually for principal repayment. Each lottery will be held in Beijing on August 10th each year, and representatives from all walks of life will be invited to supervise. Bonds whose last two digits of the bond number match the numbers drawn will be considered winning bonds.

    3. Both types of bonds are entrusted to the People's Bank of China for handling principal and interest repayments. Winning bonds are subject to the winning bond numbers announced by the Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China each time.

    4. The face value of principal and interest for both types of bonds is in old currency. When repaying principal and interest, it should be converted and paid according to the ratio of one yuan in new currency for every ten thousand yuan in old currency, as stipulated by the State Council of the People's Republic of China.

    5. For both types of bonds, the period for redeeming principal and interest is from September 30th to December 31st each year within the repayment period. The People's Bank of China in various locations will verify and redeem the bonds. To take care of the interests of bondholders, principal and interest that are due but not collected during the redemption period can be collected during the next redemption period. For those who have not collected principal and interest for each time, the redemption period will be extended for another nine months in the final year (i.e., until September 30, 1963, for the 1954 bonds; until September 30, 1966, for the 1955 bonds). If they are not collected by the end of the extended period, the creditor's rights will become invalid and will not be redeemed.

    6. For bonds that should have been redeemed for principal each time they win the lottery, the basic principal will continue to accrue interest at the original interest rate until it is collected.

    7. Bondholders can collect the annual principal and interest from the People's Bank of China in various locations by presenting their bonds. Due interest will be redeemed with the interest coupons attached to the bonds, but the entire bond must be submitted to the bank for verification and clipping. If the bondholder clips it themselves, it will not be redeemed.

    8. The redemption of damaged or defaced bonds shall be handled in accordance with the "Measures for Handling the Redemption of Damaged or Defaced National Bonds."

    9. The repayment of principal and interest for both types of bonds will be based on the bonds themselves and will not be subject to loss reporting.

    10. Both types of bonds are exempt from interest income tax.

    财政部公布一九五四年和一九五五年国家经济建设公债还本付息办法
    财政部最近制定并公布了“一九五四年和一九五五年国家经济建设公债还本付息办法”。办法如下：
    一、本办法根据一九五四年和一九五五年国家经济建设公债条例第五、六、七条规定制定。
    二、一九五四年国家经济建设公债本金自一九五五年起至一九六二年止分八年作八次偿还；一九五五年国家经济建设公债本金自一九五六年起至一九六五年止分十年作十次偿还。除最后一年对应还本金数额不举行抽签全部偿还外，其余均按年抽签还本一次。每次抽签，定于每年八月十日在北京举行，邀请各界代表到场监督，以债券号码末尾两字与抽出签枝的号码相同的为中签债券。
    三、两种公债，都委托中国人民银行办理还本和付息事宜。中签债券一律以中华人民共和国财政部每次通告的中签债券号码为准。
    四、两种公债本息票面额均系旧币，在偿还本息时，应根据中华人民共和国国务院规定每一万元折算新币一元的比值兑付。
    五、两种公债，在还本年限内，每年九月三十日至十二月三十一日为兑付本息期，由各地中国人民银行验券兑付。为照顾持券人的利益，在兑付期内，应兑未取的本息，可在下次兑付期内领取。对未领取各次本息的，在最后一年再延长兑付期九个月（即一九五四年公债至一九六三年九月三十日为止；一九五五年公债至一九六六年九月三十日为止）。延期届满时如再不领取，债权即失时效，不予兑付。
    六、每次中签应当还本的债券，到期如不领取本金的，基本金仍按原定利率计付利息，直到领取时为止。
    七、每年应付本息，持券人凭券向各地中国人民银行领取。到期利息，概凭债券上附带的息票兑付，但须将全张债券交银行查验剪兑，持券人自行剪裁的，不予兑付。
    八、残破污损债券的兑付，按照“国家公债债券残破污损兑付处理办法”的规定办理。
    九、两种公债的偿还本息，概凭债券兑付，不予挂失。
    十、两种公债都免征利息所得税。
