The Fate of a Finger
　　Mù Zhēn

　　On the morning of March 12th, I took my child to the surgical clinic of the Fourth Hospital of the Central Government directly affiliated organs. My child is fifteen years old and a third-year junior high school student. The illness wasn't very serious to begin with; he just injured the little finger of his right hand while playing basketball. After a few days, when he noticed some swelling and pain, he started coming here for treatment. However, for more than ten days, the finger had become increasingly swollen, and even the lymph glands under his right armpit had swollen. The child was in so much pain that he couldn't sleep well at night. And yesterday, the doctor took an X-ray of his finger. I felt the situation was serious, so I specifically took a half-day off to accompany him to see the doctor.

　　The child sat down in front of the doctor. Each time he was treated by a young doctor surnamed Su. But today, he was seen by a not-so-young doctor, who I heard was the attending surgeon, surnamed Chen. After asking the child's name, Dr. Chen picked up the X-ray and examined it against the light.

　　"It was seen too late. The bone has been eroded by pus and needs to be removed."

　　"What?" I was anxious. "Can't it be removed?"

　　The child stared at the doctor with both eyes, then looked at me, his expression was distressing.

　　"It's a very small operation, it's nothing. It will be fine after it's removed," the doctor said lightly. But the child and I, as his mother, felt heavy-hearted.

　　"He's been treated here for more than ten days. Why is it more serious than when he first came? Why didn't you give him some anti-inflammatory pills or penicillin shots?"

　　"Oh, what, didn't he get penicillin shots?" He picked up the medical record and glanced at it, then said coldly, "Penicillin shots are useless. Look!" He pointed to the X-ray. "The pus has already invaded the bone. It will be faster to remove it!" The part he was pointing to as needing removal was the joint closest to the end of the little finger.

　　At this time, he asked the child to unwrap the bandage on his hand and looked at the finger, which was swollen and bluish-purple, emitting a dull, dark glow.

　　"It's a very small operation, very easy to remove."

　　"The bone fractured when it was bumped, pus got in. It must be removed," said Dr. Su, who usually treated the child, interrupting from the side. This was the same Dr. Su who made an incision on the child's finger to drain the pus on the first day. He had also seen him several times after that. According to the child, he could only hear two sentences from him each time: "Open it!" This meant that the child had to unwrap the bandage on his finger himself. After looking at the wound once or twice, he would issue the second sentence: "Go change the dressing!" Each dressing change involved stuffing the same gauze soaked in yellow medicine into the wound. Each time, the child felt like he was undergoing torture. I thought: since he knew the bone was fractured and had to be removed, why did the child have to suffer for so many days? But I thought it would be best not to offer any opinions in this situation, so I pleaded:

　　"Having raised the child to this age was not easy. Doctor, he will soon become a state worker, and it will always be inconvenient if a section of his finger is missing. If it can be preserved, it doesn't matter if it takes a little longer to heal."

　　"It won't affect his work. Look, isn't it the same to hold a pen even with a missing finger?" Dr. Chen was writing something, deliberately sticking up his little finger for us to see.

　　"It wasn't easy bringing this child up. Doctor, he'll soon be a state worker, it’s always inconvenient to be missing part of a finger."

　　"This is our decision. We will operate next Monday, and I will personally remove it."

　　He said the word "personally" very solemnly, as if he were a very experienced "removal" doctor. Like "butcher Ding carving an ox, having no whole ox in his eyes," he seemed interested only in "removal" and not in how to preserve it. A finger, though small, is still part of a person's body! I wanted to say something, but he had already asked the nurse to call "next."

　　I helplessly led my child out of the clinic. The child's face was pale, and he raised his bandaged right hand, looking at it and saying dejectedly:

　　"I'm leaving the team (Young Pioneers) today, I didn't expect it (the finger team) to leave the team too."

　　After walking a few steps, he asked again:

　　"Mom, if a section of my little finger is removed, can I still study mechanical engineering in the future? Can I still join the army?"

　　The child's words pierced my heart, and the doctor's cold, lordly attitude and the tone of announcing a verdict made me distrust them. I decided to make some more efforts to try to preserve my child's finger.

　　I found a familiar old doctor, not specializing in surgery, but I knew his surgery was also very good, so I asked him to make an exception and help. He gave him a penicillin shot every day and changed the dressing every other day. The medicine was just ordinary anti-inflammatory ointment and anti-inflammatory powder. After only thirteen penicillin shots and two weeks, the finger was completely healed. It didn't have to "leave the team."

　　This is the fate of one finger of my child. Thinking about this, I can't help but worry about more patients. Under the hands of doctors who are so fond of "removal," will some people be left with disabilities that are greater than losing a section of a finger and shouldn't be? Of course, apart from doctors who rely solely on scalpels for treatment, there are still a large majority of doctors who have a deep sense of sympathy for patients.

### 一个手指头的命运

　　一个手指头的命运
　　慕真
    三月十二日上午，我带了孩子走进了中央直属机关第四医院门诊部的外科诊疗室。孩子已经十五岁，是初中三年级的学生了。病呢，原也不很严重，只是玩篮球时挫伤了右手的小指头，过了几天，发觉有些青肿，有些疼痛的时候，就开始到这里来诊治。可是，十多天来，指头却越肿越厉害，连右臂腋下的淋巴腺也肿起来了。孩子疼得夜里睡不好觉。而昨天，医生又给他的手指照了爱克斯光的透视像。我感到情况严重了，所以特地请了半天假，陪他一同来看病。
    孩子坐到医生的面前了。每次给他看病的，是一位年青的大夫，姓苏。可是今天又换了一位不很年青的大夫，听说是外科的主治医师，姓陈。陈大夫问过孩子的姓名以后，就拿起爱克斯光的透视片迎着亮处察看。
    “看的迟了，骨头受到脓的腐蚀，需要切除。”
      “什么？”我急了：“不切除不行吗？”
    孩子瞪着两只眼睛望望大夫又看看我，那眼色是叫人难过的。
      “很小的手术，没什么，切除了就好了。”
    大夫说得很轻松。可是孩子和作为母亲的我却感到沉重了。
      “在这里治了十多天了，怎么比刚来看的时候还严重了？为什么不给吃点消炎片或打打盘尼西林呢？”
      “哦，怎么，没有打盘尼西林吗？”他拿起病历表，扫了两眼之后却又冷冰冰地说：“打盘尼西林也没有用。你看！”他指着爱克斯光照片说：“脓已经侵入骨头了，切除了好的快！”他指的那应该切除的部分，是小指末一节邻近关节的地方。
    这时候，他才要孩子解开手上的纱布，看了看那肿成青紫色、发出一种乌黯的亮光的手指。
      “很小的手术，很容易切除。”
      “碰伤时骨折了，进去了脓，不切除不行。”平常给孩子看病的那位苏大夫从旁插口说。就是这位苏大夫，第一天就给孩子的指头开了一刀，放了脓。以后又由他看了几次。听孩子说，每次差不多只能听到他的两句话：“打开！”这是说要孩子自己解开缠在指头上的纱布。他朝伤口看上一眼两眼之后，就发出第二句话：“换药去！”每次换药都是用同样的浸了黄药水的纱布向伤口里塞。每次孩子都像在受一种苦刑。我想：既然知道骨折了，非切除不可，为什么还要孩子受这么些天的罪？可是我想在这种场合还是不提什么意见为好，所以我还是恳求地说：
      “手指头被切除一节，要影响孩子一生的工作的。如果能保留下来，好的慢一点也没关系。”
      “不会影响工作的。瞧，缺一个手指头拿笔还不是一样吗？”陈大夫在写什么，故意翘起小指头给我们看。
    “把孩子带到这样大，不容易的。大夫，他快成为国家的工作人员了，指头缺一节总是不方便的。”
      “这是我们的决定。下星期一就动手术，我亲自来切除。”
    他把“亲自”两个字说得很郑重，看样子这是一位很有经验的“切除”大夫。“庖丁解牛，目无全牛”，他感兴趣的好像只是“切除”，而不是怎样设法保留。指头虽小，也总是人的肢体的一部分啊！我还想说什么，可是他已经要护士喊“下一个”了。
    我领着孩子无可奈何地走出了门诊部。孩子的脸色灰白，他举起缠着纱布的右手边看边懊丧地说：
      “我今天要离队（少年先锋队）了，想不到它也要离队（手指的队）了。”
    走了几步，他又问道：
    “妈，小手指被切除一节，我将来还能学机械科吗？还能参军吗？”
    孩子的话刺痛了我的心，而方才医生的那种冷冰冰的老爷态度，宣布判决似的口吻，又引起了我对他们的不信任。我决定为争取保全孩子的指头再作一些努力。
    我找到了一位熟识的老医生，不是专治外科的，但我知道他的外科也很好，所以请他破例帮助。他每天打一支盘尼西林，隔一天换一次药，药也只是普通的消炎膏和消炎粉。只打了十三支盘尼西林，经过两星期的时间，手指就完全好了。它不必“离队”了。
    我的孩子的一个手指头的命运就是如此。想起这件事来，我禁不住为更多的患者担心，在这样喜欢“切除”的大夫的手下，是不是会有些人带上不应有的比丧失一节手指头更大的残疾呢？自然，除了单凭手术刀治病的医生以外，毕竟还有绝大多数医生，是对病人怀有一颗深切同情的心的。
