    New Products Shouldn't Be Trial-Produced This Way
    By Our Reporter, Xi Ping

    Since 1953, the state-owned Shanghai Precision Medical Instrument Factory has been engaged in the trial production of many new products. It is commendable that this factory can, in a timely manner, undertake this work in accordance with the gradual improvement of people's lives and the development of medical work. The Ministry of Light Industry has also provided support in various aspects for this factory's efforts. However, the Shanghai Precision Medical Instrument Factory's new product trial production work over the past few years has been poorly done, with particularly serious waste, resulting in significant losses of state property.

    One of the fundamental errors of the Shanghai Precision Medical Instrument Factory that led to serious waste in the trial production of new products is their serious subjectivism and perfunctory attitude towards this complex new task. For example, in 1953, the factory leadership proposed to trial-produce a new type of X-ray machine, but what type of new X-ray machine was it? Did the factory have the strength to guarantee the completion of this new product trial production task? Could domestic raw materials meet the needs of the new product manufacturing? The factory leaders did not consider these basic situations that must be clarified before trial-producing new products, and they blindly started. Some people said that the German Siemens style was good, so the technical staff proposed to imitate the German Siemens-style X-ray machine. At that time, the factory had no strength to manufacture this new product at all, so it handed over this new product to the Shanghai Tobacco Machinery Factory for processing. Soon, the factory leadership felt that this German Siemens-style X-ray machine was not suitable, and hastily changed the plan, deciding to re-trial-produce it by imitating the Soviet X-ray machine. A large amount of money and time was wasted in vain. This kind of blind and hasty trial production existed to varying degrees in the trial production of other new products.

    The capitalist design thinking of the designers is also an important reason for the serious waste in the trial production of new products. When designing new products, designers often do not investigate and understand the actual needs of society, the purchasing power of society, and how to use domestically produced materials as much as possible to reduce the cost of new products. Instead, they blindly pursue the "novelty" and "high-end" of new products, trying to show off their personal skills through new products. For example, when trial-producing a small X-ray machine, the designers completely divorced from reality and proposed to concentrate the advantages of similar products from various countries on this new product, such as the American-style X-ray tube head high-voltage generator, the Czech-style diffusing grid, and the Soviet-style voltage stabilizer. They wanted it for both civilian and military use, truly thinking of everything in the best possible way. This kind of design that is divorced from reality opened the door to waste, and many parts had to use high-grade alloys, which were very expensive. Also, because the advantages of various countries were adopted, many parts were a separate set, and the parts of other types of X-ray machines were not suitable. This made the cost of the new product exceed the original plan by 121 percent. More seriously, because this X-ray machine did not deeply understand the actual needs of society before trial production, and subjectively attempted to be used for both military and civilian purposes, the trial production result is: it is too bulky for military use, and the cost is too high for civilian use. The "dual-use" has become "dual-unsuitable," and it has to be re-transformed.

    Trial production of new products is a new technical work, so sufficient technical preparations must be made and procedures must be strictly followed in order to reduce much waste. However, the Shanghai Precision Medical Instrument Factory was very hasty in the technical process of trial-producing new products, and often violated reasonable procedures. They often put materials into production before the design was completed, and it was common for designers to go to the workshop to modify drawings, resulting in this workshop producing while that workshop was reworking. In 1953, many parts of the heart descriptor trial-produced by this factory were designed and processed at the same time. Finally, for some parts such as resistors and vacuum tubes that could not be bought on the domestic market for a while, the technical staff searched for some parts on the second-hand stalls and falsely reported to the higher-level authorities that the heart descriptor had been trial-produced. In fact, it was not made at that time, and this machine is still being trial-produced at the Shanghai Industrial Test Institute of the Ministry of Light Industry. The small X-ray machine trial-produced by this factory in 1954 was also not handled according to procedures. The complete drawings of the small X-ray machine were not drawn until September, but as early as February of the same year, some parts of the machine had already begun to be processed.

    In order to trial-produce new products, it is necessary for the factory to reasonably add some equipment, but efforts should be made to save money. The leaders of the Shanghai Precision Medical Instrument Factory did not do this. In the name of trial-producing new products, they purchased a large number of expensive high-end equipment, many of which could be completely saved. In 1953, when this factory trial-produced X-ray machines, the state invested 125,200 yuan at that time. After the factory received this money, it first purchased a large number of equipment for 122,500 yuan, such as drilling machines, high-voltage measuring instruments, gantry planers, and gas welding equipment. But until now, many equipment are rarely used or have never been used at all. What needs to be specially mentioned here is a high-voltage measuring instrument. This instrument was an exhibit at the Industrial Exhibition of the German Democratic Republic in Shanghai. At that time, three units urgently needed to buy this instrument. The Precision Medical Instrument Factory repeatedly emphasized the importance of its trial production of new products and ran around everywhere. As a result, it bought back this instrument, but it has not been officially used once so far. In 1954, the state wanted this factory to conduct the intermediate trial production of intensifying screens (an important part of the X-ray machine) in order to prepare conditions for formal production. After receiving this task, the factory immediately started large-scale construction and built a large new workshop, saying it was for the intermediate trial production of intensifying screens. However, according to the existing equipment in this workshop, the annual output can supply the X-ray machines produced by this factory for four years. Not only is such a large workshop not needed for intermediate trial production, but such a large workshop is not needed even for formal production in the future.

    Why did the Precision Medical Instrument Factory cause such a large waste in the trial production of new products? This is mainly because the administrative leaders of the factory were intoxicated by some small achievements in the past, and they developed serious arrogance and complacency. They no longer worked diligently, but were fond of grand achievements and loved to hear praise and flattery, and were unwilling to humbly listen to criticism. This is the root cause of many chaotic phenomena. For example, some products trial-produced by the Precision Medical Instrument Factory should not have been produced by them according to the reasonable division of labor, but they rashly undertook the trial production from the standpoint of their own interests, and the technical conditions were not available, resulting in many errors and wastes. When this factory was trial-producing a large X-ray machine, the diagnostic bed on the X-ray machine should have been entrusted to a metal processing factory for manufacturing according to the management division of labor of the machine industry at that time, but the factory did not consider its own technical conditions, and tried to manufacture it itself, and allocated a large amount of trial production funds and purchased a large number of equipment; such as lathes, drilling machines, etc. However, after the equipment was purchased, because they did not know how to manufacture it, they finally entrusted another factory to process it. In this way, this batch of equipment was idle.

    Vice-director Wen Yao (this factory does not have a director) is more responsible in this regard. Wen Yao has achieved certain achievements in studying technology, but he showed the wrong tendency of immersing himself in technology and not asking about politics. He did not pay attention to studying the instructions of higher-level leading organs, and did not actively strive for the supervision of the Party organization. He rarely reported the major issues related to the trial production of new products to the branch, let alone discussed them. He often subjectively decided to act alone. He even did not pay attention to management work, so that many systems in the factory became a formality, many things were no one responsible for, and accidents occurred frequently. From 1953 to 1954, there were 66 recorded accidents in the factory's laboratory, of which more than two-thirds were responsibility accidents. These accidents not only caused losses to state property, but also delayed the progress of new product trial production.

    The Party branch of the Precision Medical Instrument Factory also has serious shortcomings in political and ideological leadership work. Criticism and self-criticism within the Party were not carried out, and no principled struggle was launched against some of Wen Yao's bad tendencies, but a wrong attitude of appeasement was adopted. In addition, the implementation of the unity, education and transformation of technical personnel was also extremely weak. The technical force of the Precision Medical Instrument Factory is quite strong, but they generally have bourgeois technical views, such as formalistically blindly pursuing the so-called international standards, emphasizing interest and personal masterpieces, etc., and the Party organization of the factory has never combined practical work to carry out in-depth education and criticism of this kind of thinking, and is basically in a state of laissez-faire. This has allowed many erroneous views to run rampant in practical work for a long time, which is the root cause of many errors.

    Manufacturing new products is a major event in our country's economic life. The serious waste phenomenon in the trial production of new products in the state-owned Shanghai Precision Medical Instrument Factory is completely inconsistent with the requirements of our country. Now the Pharmaceutical Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry has dispatched an inspection team to this factory to conduct inspections, and based on the inspection results, has put forward improvement suggestions.

    不能这样试制新产品
    本报记者　习平
    从一九五三年开始，国营上海精密医疗器械厂进行了许多种新产品的试制工作。这个厂能根据人民生活的逐步改善和医疗工作的发展，适时地从事这方面的工作，是值得赞许的。轻工业部对于这个厂的这种努力，也给予了各方面的支持。但是，上海精密医疗器械厂几年来的新产品试制工作，却做得很不好，特别是浪费现象异常严重，以致使国家财产遭到了很大的损失。
    上海精密医疗器械厂在试制新产品中造成严重浪费的根本错误之一，是他们对待这件复杂的新工作，抱着严重的主观主义和草率从事的工作态度。例如，一九五三年，这个厂的领导上提出要试制一种新型的X光机，但是这种新型的X光机到底是什么类型的？厂内有没有力量保证这种新产品试制任务的完成？国内原材料能否供应新产品制造的需要，对这些试制新产品之前必须弄清的基本情况，厂的领导人竟不予考虑，就盲目地动起手来。有的人说德国西门子式样好，于是技术人员就提出按德国西门子式的X光机仿造。当时厂内根本没有力量制造这种新产品，就把这一新产品交给上海烟草机械一厂去加工。不久，厂的领导上又觉得这种德国西门子式X光机不合用，又匆匆改变了计划，决定仿照苏联X光机重新试制。大量的钱和时间就这样被白白耗费掉了。这种盲目、草率试制的情况，在其他新产品的试制中也都不同程度地存在。
    设计人员的资本主义设计思想，也是造成新产品试制中严重浪费的重要原因。设计人员在设计新产品时，常常不去调查了解社会的实际需要，社会的购买能力，以及如何尽量使用国内生产的材料，降低新产品的成本等等，而是一味追求新产品的“新颖”、“高级”，企图通过新产品来显一显个人的身手。例如在试制小型X光机时，设计人员完全脱离实际地提出要把各国同样产品的优点都集中到这部新产品上来，什么球管头高压发生器要美国式的啦，散光珊要捷克式的啦，电压稳定器要苏联式的等等，并且既要民用，还要军用，真是想得尽善尽美。这种脱离实际的设计，结果就给浪费打开了大门，许多部件要使用高级合金，价钱很昂贵。又因为采用了各国的优点，很多部件都是单独一套，其他型式X光机的部件都不合用。这就使新产品费用超过原订计划百分之一百二十一。更严重的是：这台X光机因为在试制前没有深入了解社会实际需要情况，主观地企图军、民两用，现在试制结果是：军用嫌太笨重，民用又嫌成本过高，“两用”变成了“两不合用”，只好重新改造。
    试制新产品是一件新的技术工作，因此在技术上必须作充分的准备，并且要严格地按照规定的程序办事，才可以减少许多浪费。但是上海精密医疗器械厂在试制新产品的技术过程中，表现得十分草率，经常违反合理的程序。他们常常没有设计完毕就投料生产，设计人员下车间修改图样是常事，结果是这个车间在生产，那个车间却在返工。一九五三年这个厂试制心脏描写器的许多部件，就是一面设计、一面加工的。最后有若干零件如电阻、真空管等，国内市场一时没法买到的，就由技术人员到旧货摊上搜罗一些零件，向上级机关谎报心脏描写器已经试制完工了。其实当时并未制成，直到现在这部机器还在轻工业部上海工业试验所继续试制中。这个厂在一九五四年试制的小型X光机，也是没有按照程序办事。小型X光机的完整图纸九月份才画出来，可是早在同年的二月间，机器的部分部件却已经在着手加工。
    为了试制新产品，工厂合理地添置一些设备是必要的，但是应当力求节省。上海精密医疗器械厂的领导人却不是这样，他们以试制新产品为名，大量地购置了许多价钱昂贵的高级设备，而这些设备有不少是完全可以节省的。一九五三年这个厂试制X光机时，国家当时曾投资十二万五千二百元，这个厂拿到这笔钱以后，首先就以十二万二千五百元购置大批的设备，如钻床、高压测量仪、龙门刨床和气焊设备等。可是直到现在，许多设备用得很少或者根本没有用过。这里要特别提到的是一架高压测量仪，这架仪器是德意志民主共和国工业展览会在上海的展览品，当时有三个单位急需要买这一仪器，精密医疗器械厂百般强调本厂试制新产品的重要性，到处奔波，结果把这件仪器买回来了，但到现在还没有正式用过一次。一九五四年国家要这个厂进行增感屏（X光机中的重要部件）的中间试制，以便为正式生产准备条件。厂里接到这一任务后，立即大兴土木，新建了一个大的车间，说是为了增感屏的中间试制。但是，根据这个车间现有的设备，一年的产量就可供这个厂四年所生产的X光机用。不但是中间试制用不着这样大的车间，就是将来正式生产了也完全用不着这样大的车间。
    精密医疗器械厂在试制新产品中为什么造成这样大的浪费呢？这主要是厂的行政领导人为过去一些微小的成绩所陶醉了，滋长了严重的骄傲自满情绪，在工作上也就不再兢兢业业，而是好大喜功，只喜欢听表扬和奉承，不肯虚心听取批评，这是许多纷乱现象发生的根源。例如精密医疗器械厂试制的有些产品，按照合理的分工，是不应当由他们生产的，但他们从本位利益出发，便贸然承担试制，技术条件又不具备，结果造成许多错误和浪费。这个厂在试制大型X光机时，当时按照机器工业的管理分工，X光机上的诊视床应委托金属加工厂制造，但该厂不考虑自己的技术条件，企图自己制造，并且拨用了大批试制费，购置了大批的设备；如车床、钻床等，可是，当设备购置后，因不会制造，最后还是委托另一家工厂加工，这样，这批设备就闲置起来。
    在这方面负有较多责任的是副厂长闻尧（这个厂没有正厂长）。闻尧在钻研技术上是有一定成就的，但是他表现了埋头钻技术不问政治的错误倾向，不注意研究上级领导机关的指示，不主动争取党组织的监督，有关新产品试制的重大问题，他很少向支部汇报，更不讨论，往往就一个人主观地决定行事。他甚至对管理工作也不重视，以致厂内许多制度流于形式，许多事情无人负责，事故不断发生。厂的实验室一九五三年到一九五四年发生的事故，有记录可查的即有六十六件，其中有三分之二以上都是责任事故。这些事故不但使国家财产遭受了损失，也延迟了新产品试制工作的进度。
    精密医疗器械厂的党支部在政治思想领导工作上，也有严重的缺点，党内批评和自我批评没有开展，对闻尧的一些不良倾向没有展开原则斗争，而采取了错误的迁就态度。另外在贯彻对技术人员的团结教育改造工作上也异常薄弱。精密医疗器械厂的技术力量是相当强的，但他们中间普遍有资产阶级的技术观点，如形式主义地盲目追求所谓国际标准，强调兴趣和个人杰作等等，而厂的党组织却从没有结合实际工作，对这种思想进行深刻的教育和批判，基本上是处于放任自流状态。这就使得许多错误观点长期在实际工作中泛滥，这是造成许多错误的根源。
    制造新产品是我们国家经济生活中的大事。国营上海精密医疗器械厂试制新产品中的这种严重浪费现象，同我们国家的要求是完全不相符的。现在轻工业部医药工业管理局已经派遣了检查组到这个厂进行了检查，并根据检查结果，提出了改进意见。
