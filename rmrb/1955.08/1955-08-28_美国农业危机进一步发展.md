　　Further Development of the American Agricultural Crisis
　　Qin Benli
    Recently, in the American newspapers and the speeches of American officials, increasingly frequent appearances of uneasy tones about the growing signs of the American agricultural crisis have been observed.

    An Associated Press reporter said in a recent report: American agricultural operators, agricultural officials, and taxpayers "are worried about the United States' seven billion dollar agricultural surplus inventory. … This large pile of inventory casts a shadow over domestic and foreign markets." U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Benson recently also said: The large number of "surplus" agricultural products in the hands of the government "gives us a heavy burden and also causes us to encounter serious market problems."

    According to official materials cited by the U.S. News & World Report magazine, the value of agricultural products currently owned by the U.S. government or held as loan collateral is nearly $7.2 billion. In the past year (ending June this year), U.S. "surplus" agricultural products increased by $1.2 billion. U.S. taxpayers have to spend several hundred million dollars a year just to store these "excess" agricultural products, and the agricultural products piled there are still deteriorating in large quantities.

    The increase in "excess" agricultural products has caused wholesale prices of agricultural products to continue to fall. Since 1951, the average price at which American farmers sell agricultural products has fallen by about 24 percent.

    As agricultural product prices fall, the net income of American farmers continues to decline. The net income of American farmers was $16 billion in 1951, which was reduced to about $12.2 billion in 1954, a total decrease of about 25 percent. In 1955, according to estimates by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, it will be reduced by another 4 percent. However, the prices that farmers pay when purchasing agricultural production machines and other industrial products they need have increased unabated, and as a result, the living conditions of farmers are getting worse and worse. Only those agricultural monopoly capitalists and large farm owners are exceptions.

    American officials say that the large "surplus" of agricultural products is due to farmers producing "too much." This statement has no practical significance. At the same time that U.S. agricultural product "surpluses" have entered an unprecedentedly serious stage, U.S. food consumption has not yet returned to pre-war levels. At present, the level of bread consumption in the United States is still 20 percent lower than before the war; if calculated according to pre-war consumption levels, American residents would need 2.25 million tons more flour than they do now. The average per capita consumption of oils in 1953 was 8.6 pounds, while in the five years before the war, the average annual consumption of oils per resident was 16.8 pounds, a decrease of 48.8 percent compared with before the war. If the per capita consumption of milk and various dairy products in 1953 were at the 1939 level, then not only would there not be a large backlog in the warehouses of the Commodity Credit Corporation - a government-established agricultural product procurement agency - but also 19 billion to 20 billion pounds of milk would be lacking each year.

    In fact, there are many people living in hunger. Currently, there are more than one million people in the United States applying for surplus grain relief alone. The amount of relief grain they receive is already very limited, but according to a decision by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, starting from July 1, the amount of surplus grain relief will be reduced, the conditions for applying for relief will be raised, and the number of people receiving relief will be reduced. This decision by the Department of Agriculture has aroused widespread anger among the poor. Pennsylvania Governor Leader received letters of protest from many residents in 50 counties in the state, accusing the Department of Agriculture's actions of being a "starvation policy."

    The increasing U.S. agricultural product "surpluses" in recent years have occurred even with agricultural production declining. U.S. agricultural product output in 1954 decreased by 3 percent compared with 1953; it is not much more than the average output from 1947-1949, while the U.S. population has increased by 20 million people since 1947.

    So, what is the reason that makes the U.S. agricultural product surplus develop to such a serious point? The unprecedentedly huge taxes levied for military expansion and war preparation, inflation, and massive unemployment have reduced the purchasing power of the American people; at the same time, American monopoly capital artificially maintains the retail prices of food at very high levels for profit, resulting in a decrease in the amount of food consumed by the American people, which deepens the contradiction between production and consumption that already exists.

    The retail prices of food do not decrease correspondingly due to the "surplus" of agricultural products and the drop in farmers' selling prices, and the prices of some staple foods are constantly increasing. For example, from 1948 to 1954, the price at which farmers sold wheat decreased by 32 percent, while the retail price of bread increased by 23 percent.

    American bourgeois newspapers have had to admit this unreasonable phenomenon. But they attempt to attribute this to housewives' high demands for food quality and packaging. This is of course deceptive. The real situation is this: the agriculture and food of the United States, like all other aspects of American life, are controlled by monopoly capitalists, and the manufacturing and distribution of food are in the hands of large monopoly organizations. These monopoly organizations squeeze the prices for procuring farmers' products lower and lower; but on the other hand, they set the prices charged to food consumers higher and higher, from which they obtain high profits.

    The deterioration of U.S. agricultural product foreign market sales conditions in recent years has also played a significant role in accelerating the development of the U.S. agricultural product "surplus" crisis.

    Foreign markets are very important to American agriculture. Currently, agricultural products cultivated for export account for one-third of the total sown area in the United States. American agriculture is more dependent on foreign markets than ever before.

    However, the foreign sales market for U.S. agricultural products is constantly shrinking. In the main regions for U.S. agricultural product exports, the countries of Western Europe, agriculture has gradually recovered in recent years, coupled with the impact of the lack of foreign exchange and economic militarization, which has greatly reduced these countries' purchases of U.S. agricultural products. Due to the recovery of exports from other agricultural countries, competition in the international agricultural product market has also intensified. Under these circumstances, despite the U.S. government's use of various "gift" and "aid" methods, as well as subsidizing agricultural product exports, selling in local currencies, and conducting price wars, to massively promote its surplus agricultural products, U.S. agricultural product exports are still constantly declining.

    Except for the relatively large increase in export volume in 1951-1952 due to the impact of the Korean War, since 1948-1949, U.S. agricultural product exports have declined almost year by year, from a level of $3.83 billion to only $2.3 billion in 1954-1955, a total decrease of more than one-third. The current export volume is far from offsetting the widening gap between domestic consumption and production.

    The burden of the developing U.S. agricultural crisis falls on consumers and small and medium farmers. Here, we should mention some of the measures taken by the U.S. government to alleviate the agricultural production "surplus" crisis. These measures only maintain the interests of large farm owners and are detrimental to small and medium farmers.

    The main measure taken by the U.S. government is to implement the so-called "parity" policy, using massive purchases of agricultural products to maintain agricultural product prices. Because the production costs of small and medium farmers are generally higher than the "parity," they find it difficult to benefit from government price subsidies; they generally cannot wait for government purchases, and they usually can only sell agricultural products to intermediaries or large food companies at market prices lower than the "parity." As for large farm owners and agricultural capitalists, their production costs are lower than the "parity," and they benefit greatly from the government's guaranteed purchase method.

    One of the measures taken by the U.S. government is to forcibly reduce cultivated land area in order to reduce output. In 1954, the wheat planting area was reduced by 30 percent compared with 1953, and the cotton planting area was reduced by 28 percent. In 1955, the cultivated area of ​​wheat, cotton, and other crops continued to shrink. It is generally estimated that reducing cultivated land area will not have a significant impact on the income of large farms with thousands of hectares, but small farmers will inevitably fall into disaster. For example, in the East Coast region of the Mississippi River, there are 210,000 small cotton farmers, and under the cotton field quota this year, the cotton they produce is not enough to cover production costs. As a result, many cotton farmers have had to abandon their fields and look for other jobs.

    Recently, some American officials and newspapers have also launched a movement. The purpose of this movement is to have more than one million small farms "voluntarily" be eliminated. This is taken as an emergency measure to save the agricultural crisis. The result of doing so will be to push a large number of small and medium farmers into bankruptcy. This will accelerate the process of capitalist concentration in the agricultural economy, thereby further deepening the development of the American agricultural crisis.

    In order to alleviate the increasingly serious agricultural crisis, the U.S. government is now vigorously dumping products abroad. Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill to accelerate the foreign sales of surplus agricultural products, authorizing the Commodity Credit Corporation to increase the amount of agricultural products sold in exchange for foreign currency from $700 million to $1.5 billion, and stipulating that "the new limit should be regarded as a goal to be achieved as soon as possible." However, opening up foreign markets may play a certain role in alleviating the crisis, but it cannot solve the fundamental causes of the crisis. In a situation where the entire consumer market in the capitalist world is shrinking and competition in the agricultural product market is intensifying, it is impossible to find a broad sales market for American "surplus" agricultural products. The United States' strengthening of dumping will only greatly intensify the contradictions between various opposing forces in the agricultural product market of the capitalist world.

    The further development of the American agricultural crisis is bound to increasingly threaten the entire American economy. And the facts once again prove that the evil consequences caused by economic militarization only create the preconditions for the accelerated arrival of new and even deeper economic crises. It is not difficult to understand why, in American political life, there is currently a force developing that demands strengthening peace and easing international tensions, and that the call for transforming the American war economy into a peaceful economy and developing normal international trade is growing louder and louder.

　　美国农业危机进一步发展
　　钦本立
    最近以来，在美国报刊和美国官员的言论中，越来越频繁地出现了关于美国农业危机征象增长的不安的论调。
    美联社记者不久前在一篇报道中说：美国农业经营者、农业官员和纳税人“对于美国价值七十亿美元的农业剩余存货感到忧虑。……这一大堆存货的阴影笼罩着国内外市场。”美国农业部长本逊最近也说：政府手中的大批“剩余”农产品“给了我们沉重的负担，还使我们遇到严重的市场问题。”
    据美国“新闻与世界报道”杂志引用的官方材料，目前美国政府拥有或者作为贷款抵押品持有的农产品价值已近七十二亿美元。在过去一年（到今年六月底）中，美国“剩余”农产品增加了十二亿美元。美国纳税人单单为了保管这些“过剩”农产品就得每年花费几亿美元，而堆在那里的农产品还是大量的在败坏中。
      “过剩”农产品的增加使农产品批发价格不断下跌。自一九五一年以来，美国农民出售农产品的平均价格就下跌了约百分之二十四。
    随着农产品价格下跌，美国农民的净收入不断下降。美国农民净收入一九五一年为一百六十亿美元，到一九五四年减为约一百二十二亿美元，共下降了百分之二十五左右。一九五五年，据美国农业部估计，将再减低百分之四。可是，农民在购置他们所需的农业生产机器和其他工业品时所出的价格却有增无减，结果是农民的生活境况愈来愈恶劣。只有那些农业垄断资本家和大农场主例外。
    美国官员把农产品大量“过剩”说成是由于农民生产“过多”。这种说法是没有任何实际意义的。就在美国农产品“过剩”进入空前严重阶段的同时，美国的食品消费量却还没有恢复到战前的水平。现在，美国面包消费水平较战前还低百分之二十；如果按照战前的消费水平，美国居民需要的面粉要比现在多二百二十五万吨。一九五三年平均每人的油类消费量为八·六磅，而在战前五年中平均每个居民每年的油类消费量为十六·八磅，即比战前减少了百分之四十八·八。如果一九五三年每人的奶类和各种奶制品的消费量处于一九三九年水平的话，那末，不仅美国商品信贷公司——政府设立的收购农产品机构——的仓库里现在不会有大量积压，反而每年缺少奶类一百九十亿——二百亿磅。
    事实上，有很多人在过着饥饿的日子。目前在美国单单申请剩余粮食救济的就在一百万人以上。他们所得的救济粮食数量本来已很有限，但是，根据美国农业部决定，从七月一日起，削减剩余粮食救济的数量，提高申请救济的条件，减少给予救济的人数。农业部的这一决定，在贫苦人民中间激起了广泛的愤怒。宾夕凡尼亚州州长李德收到了州内五十个县的许多居民的抗议信，指责农业部的作法是“饥饿政策”。
    最近几年来美国农产品“过剩”的有增无减，还是在农业生产下降的情况下出现的。美国农产品产量一九五四年比一九五三年减少百分之三；比起一九四七——一九四九年的平均产量也并不多，而美国人口比一九四七年增加了二千万人。
    那么，什么原因使得美国农产品过剩发展到如此严重的地步呢？就是为了扩军备战而征收的空前巨额捐税、通货膨胀和大量的失业降低了美国人民的购买力；同时美国垄断资本为了利润而人为地把食品零售价格保持在很高的水平，结果，美国人民食品消费量减少了，就使本来已经存在的生产和消费之间的矛盾加深。
    食品的零售价格并不因农产品“过剩”和农民出售价格跌落而相应下降，一些主食品的价格还不断提高。例如，从一九四八年到一九五四年，农民出售小麦的价格减低了百分之三十二，同时，面包的零售价格反而增加了百分之二十三。
    美国资产阶级的报刊也不得不承认这个不合理的现象。但他们企图把这归因于主妇们对食品的质量和包装要求高了。这当然是欺人之谈。真正的情形是这样：美国的农业和食品，正像美国生活上其他各方面一样，是受垄断资本家控制的，食品的制造和分配掌握在大垄断组织手中。这些垄断组织把收购农民产品的价格压得越来越低；但另一方面，向食品消费者索取的价格定得越来越高，从中取得高额的利润。
    最近几年来美国农产品国外市场销售条件的恶化，对于加速美国农产品“过剩”危机的发展也起了不小的作用。
    国外市场对于美国农业是非常重要的。现在为出口而耕种的农产品占到美国全国播种面积的三分之一。美国农业对国外市场的依赖性比以往任何时候更深。
    但是，美国农产品的国外销售市场却在不断地缩小着。美国农产品输出的主要地区西欧国家，几年来，农业逐渐恢复，加上缺乏外汇和经济军事化的影响，使这些国家对美国农产品的购买大为降低。由于其他农业国家恢复出口，国际农产品市场的竞争又加剧了。在这种情况下，尽管美国政府用各种“赠送”和“援助”的办法，以及资助农产品出口，用当地货币销售，进行价格战争，来大量推销它的过剩农产品，美国农产品出口还是不断下降。
    除了由于朝鲜战争的影响，出口量在一九五一—一九五二年度有过较大增加以外，从一九四八—一九四九年度以后，美国农产品出口从三十八亿三千万美元的水平，几乎是逐年下降，到一九五四—一九五五年度，只出口了二十三亿美元，共减少了三分之一以上。目前的出口量远不能抵销国内消费和生产之间日益扩大的差额。
    发展着的美国农业危机的重担落在消费者和小农、中农身上。这里应该提到美国政府为了缓和农业生产“过剩”危机所采取的一些办法。这些办法只是维护了大农场主的利益，而不利于小农和中农的。
    美国政府采取的主要办法是实行所谓“平价”政策，用大量收购农产品来维持农产品价格。由于小农、中农的生产成本一般都高于“平价”，他们很难从政府的价格津贴中得到好处；他们一般又等不得政府收购，而通常是只能以低于“平价”的市场价格将农产品卖给中间商或大食品公司。至于大农场主、农业资本家，他们的生产成本比“平价”低，他们从政府的包购办法中就得到了很大的好处。
    美国政府采取的办法之一是强制削减耕地面积，以减少产量。一九五四年小麦播种面积比一九五三年缩减了百分之三十，棉花播种面积缩减了百分之二十八。一九五五年小麦、棉花等农作物的耕种面积继续缩减。据一般估计，缩减耕地面积，对于拥有数千公顷的大农场来说，收入不会有什么大的影响，小农就不免陷于灾祸之中了。例如，在密西西比河东岸地区有二十一万户小棉农，在本年度棉田限额之下，他们生产的棉花就不足以弥补生产费用。于是，许多棉农不得不抛开田地寻找其他工作。
    最近美国的某些官方人士和报刊还发起了一个运动。这个运动的目的是，使一百万多个小农场“自愿地”被取消。这是作为挽救农业危机的一个紧急措施。这样做的结果将是使大批的小农、中农陷于破产的境地。这就会使农业经济中的资本主义的集中过程加速，从而更进一步地加深美国农业危机的发展。
    为了缓和日益严重的农业危机，美国政府现在正大力向国外进行倾销。最近美国众议院通过了一个加速国外销售剩余农产品的法案，授权商品信贷公司为换取外币而出售农产品的数量由七亿美元增加到十五亿美元，并规定“应当把新的限额看作是尽快达到的一个目标”。然而，开辟国外市场虽然可以对缓和危机起一定作用，但决不能解决造成危机的根本原因。在资本主义世界整个消费市场萎缩、以及农产品市场竞争加剧的形势下，不可能为美国“过剩”农产品找到宽广的销售市场。美国加强倾销只有使资本主义世界农产品市场上各种对立力量之间的矛盾大大加剧。
    美国农业危机进一步发展，势必越来越对美国的整个经济起着威胁的作用。而事实再次证明，经济军事化所引起的恶果，只有为新的而且更深重的经济危机加速到来造成前提。这就不难理解，为什么在美国的政治生活中，目前正有一种要求加强和平和缓和国际紧张局势的力量在发展，要求把美国的战争经济转变为和平经济、要求发展国际间正常的贸易的呼声越来越高。
