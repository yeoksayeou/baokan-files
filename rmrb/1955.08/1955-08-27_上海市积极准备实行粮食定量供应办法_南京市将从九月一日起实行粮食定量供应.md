Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 26th: In recent days, Shanghai's grain authorities have selected some factories to conduct pilot projects for grain rationing, in preparation for implementing the "Provisional Measures for Grain Rationing in Towns and Cities" throughout the city.

Prior to this, Shanghai's grain departments had done a lot of preparatory work. The Grain Planned Supply Office investigated the city's population situation, categorized and ranked people according to workers, staff, students, and general residents, and conducted typical surveys of consumption levels for each category. Then, based on the supply ranges stipulated in the "Provisional Measures for Grain Rationing in Towns and Cities" and with reference to the survey results, a preliminary quantitative standard for Shanghai was proposed.

Shanghai's grain rationing work will be carried out in categories and batches. First, assessment will be carried out among industrial workers, followed by organs, organizations, schools, hospitals, and organized handicraftsmen and other independent laborers, and finally residents. Under the leadership of the Party committees, governments, and trade unions, the city's thirty-six industrial units have already classified and ranked job types, initially categorizing them into three categories—special heavy physical labor, heavy physical labor, and light physical labor—to carry out reasonable rationing.

More than 10,000 cadres in the city will participate in this grain rationing work. Currently, the heads of the Party committees and governments of each district are explaining to them the significance and practices of implementing grain rationing in towns and cities.

In order to enable private grain dealers to play an active role in the implementation of grain rationing, 61 management groups with state-owned grain stores or cooperatives as the core have been established in various districts to strengthen the understanding, supervision, and management of private grain dealers. For the replica and cooked food industries, measures such as fixed quality, fixed price, and fixed quantity have also been taken to strengthen management.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 26th: Nanjing Mayor Peng Chong told Xinhua reporters: Nanjing will implement a grain rationing system throughout the city starting September 1st.

Peng Chong said: Nanjing's work to rectify grain unified purchase and sales has achieved significant results. The city's grain sales in July decreased by more than 17% compared with April before the rectification. However, on the other hand, the grain supply plan is too broad, the management system is lax, and the phenomenon of wasting grain is still quite serious, especially among residents. The results of the experimental quantitative supply in the Xiangpu Camp in Xuanwu District and the Shizha Street in Qinhuai District in July showed that more than 160,000 catties of grain could be reduced every month. This shows that, based on the past work, it is very necessary to implement a quantitative supply system. This can block all loopholes in wasting grain and save a large amount of grain for the country; at the same time, it promotes the broad masses of the people to reasonably arrange their lives according to the grain quantitative standards. It can be predicted that after the implementation of the grain rationing system in Nanjing, it will not only effectively guarantee the necessary grain needs of the city, but also strive to save about 100 million catties of grain for the country throughout the year. Peng Chong said: Judging from the current preparations for grain rationing in Nanjing, after understanding the significance of this measure, the people can consciously abide by the national grain laws and regulations, be happy to obey the national plan, and formulate family grain use plans according to the graded quantitative supply standards. All agencies and organizations in the city generally regard saving grain as a system.

　　上海市积极准备实行粮食定量供应办法
　　南京市将从九月一日起实行粮食定量供应
    新华社上海二十六日电　最近几天，上海市粮食主管部门选择了一些工厂，进行粮食定量供应的试点工作，为在全市实行市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法作准备。
    在这以前，上海市粮食部门已做了许多准备工作。粮食计划供应办公室调查了全市人口状况，按工人、职员、学生和一般居民分类排队，并分别作了消费水平的典型调查，然后根据市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法中规定的供应幅度，参照调查结果，初步提出了上海市的定量标准。
    上海市的粮食定量供应工作，将采取分类分批进行。首先在产业工人中进行评量，其次是机关、团体、学校、医院以及有组织的手工业者和其他独立劳动者，最后是居民。全市三十六个产业单位已在党委、政府和工会的领导下，进行了工种分类排队，初步把全市工种按劳动情况分别列入特殊重体力劳动、重体力劳动、轻体力劳动三大类，以便合理地进行定量。
    全市参加这次粮食定量供应工作的干部将有一万多人。现各区党委、政府的负责人正向他们讲解实行市镇粮食定量供应的意义和做法。
    为了使私营粮食代销店在实行粮食定量供应工作中能发挥积极作用，各区已先后成立了六十一个以国营粮店或合作社为核心的管理小组，加强对私营粮食代销店的了解、监督和管理；对复制品和熟食品行业，也采取定质、定价、定量的办法，加强管理。
    新华社南京二十六日电　南京市市长彭冲对新华社记者说：南京市将从九月一日起在全市范围内实行粮食定量供应制度。
    彭冲说：南京市整顿粮食统销工作，已获得显著成效。七月份全市粮食销售量比整顿前的四月份已下降了百分之十七多。但另一方面，粮食供应计划偏宽，管理制度松懈，浪费粮食的现象还相当严重，特别在居民中更为显著。七月份在玄武区的香铺营、秦淮区的石埧街两个街道办事处辖区试验定量供应的结果，每月还可以减销粮食十六万多斤。这说明，在过去工作的基础上，实行定量供应制度是十分必要的。这样可以堵塞浪费粮食的一切漏洞，为国家节约大批粮食；同时，又推动广大人民群众按粮食定量标准，合理地安排生活。可以预计，在南京市实行粮食定量供应制度以后，既能切实保证城市必须的粮食需要，又可以争取全年为国家节约一亿斤左右的粮食。彭冲说：从南京市当前粮食定量供应的准备工作情况来看，人民群众在了解了这个措施的意义以后，都能自觉遵守国家粮食法令，乐于服从国家计划，并根据分等定量供应标准，制定家庭用粮计划。全市各机关、团体一般都把节约粮食作为一个制度。
