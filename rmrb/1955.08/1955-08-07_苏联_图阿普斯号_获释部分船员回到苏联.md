Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 5th: According to TASS, twenty-nine crew members of the Soviet tanker "Tuapse" who were released returned to Moscow by plane on August 5th.

Present at Vnukovo Airport to welcome them were Soviet Minister of Merchant Marine Bakayev, representatives from all circles in Moscow, Young Pioneers of Moscow, and relatives and friends of the returning crew members of the "Tuapse."

When the crew members emerged from the plane, they were greeted with enthusiastic applause. They received many flowers.

Many welcomers spoke at a mass rally, warmly welcoming the loyal sons of the Soviet motherland who had been released from Chiang Kai-shek's prison.

The captain of the "Tuapse," V. A. Kalinin, who returned this time, replied: We encountered many difficulties in Chiang Kai-shek's concentration camp, but these difficulties were overcome by an indomitable will. Therefore, it can be said that there is not, and never will be, any force that can shake the love of Soviet sailors for their dear motherland.
