　　Today, the State Council issued the "Provisional Measures for the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" and the "Provisional Measures for the Rationed Supply of Grain in Towns and Cities." The "Provisional Measures for the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" also stipulate that the amount of grain requisitioned and purchased by the state from farmers will remain unchanged for three years from 1955 to 1956. This is a new major measure taken by the state after implementing "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" of grain in the spring and summer of this year and rectifying the unified sales of grain in urban and rural areas. It is an important step in regulating urban-rural relations, worker-peasant relations, and production-sales relations from the perspective of grain distribution. Implementing these measures will further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and contribute to the smooth completion of China's First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy.

　　Over the past two years, the state's implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain has achieved tremendous success. The needs of people in cities and industrial and mining areas, grain-deficient people in rural areas, fishermen, salt workers, forestry workers, herdsmen, and boat people have been guaranteed, and the needs of national construction and defense have also been guaranteed. It can be affirmed that without the unified purchase and sale of grain, the national market could not have remained stable, and the severe famine of 1954 could not have been smoothly overcome. We must more resolutely and effectively implement the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain; any doubt about this policy is completely unfounded.

　　However, it should be admitted that there are still many shortcomings in the specific work of unified purchase and sale of grain. Although the grain requisitioned and purchased by the state from farmers is less than one-third of the grain output, because the small-scale peasant economy still occupies an absolute advantage in China, the production, demand, surplus, and shortage of grain are difficult to fully ascertain. In addition, last year's severe famine made it necessary to purchase more surplus grain from farmers in non-disaster areas to support the needs of farmers in disaster areas. Therefore, the allocation of grain purchase tasks in some areas was not reasonable enough. Some farmers did not sell enough of their surplus grain, and some farmers sold more grain than their surplus. The shortcomings in grain sales were insufficient supply to some grain-deficient farmers in rural areas, and the main shortcoming was the supply of grain to many farmers who were not short of grain and the advance supply of grain to some farmers who should have had their supply delayed. The urban supply was too lenient, management was lax, and the phenomenon of wasting grain was even more serious. The reasons for these shortcomings and errors, when examined from the perspective of grain work, in addition to the fact that some staff members emphasized requisition and purchase and neglected unified sales, were also because the state did not have time to formulate a set of necessary specific systems and methods.

　　The two provisional measures now issued by the State Council are not only sufficient to overcome the shortcomings in grain work, but more importantly, they can improve the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers, promote the development of the agricultural cooperative movement, and promote the fundamental solution of China's grain problem.

　　China's current grain supply is sufficient for consumption. Since liberation, China's grain output has been continuously increasing. In 1949, the national grain output averaged only more than 380 jin of unprocessed grain per person; in 1954, the national average was more than 550 jin per person. Many materials show that this production level is compatible with China's current grain consumption level. This can be fully proven by the ample urban supply, the general improvement of farmers' lives, the large amount of surplus grain in rural areas both before and after the unified purchase of grain, the great development of the rural economy, and the continuous increase in the total number of livestock. Before liberation and before the War of Resistance Against Japan, due to the exploitation of the people by the reactionary rulers and the existence of feudal separatist regimes in grain management, tens of billions of jin of grain could not be transported out each year to regulate the supply and demand across the country. After liberation, the state spared no expense in subsidizing and vigorously transporting grain, reducing the grain that could not be transported temporarily to only a few billion jin. Especially after the implementation of unified purchase and sale, the utilization rate of grain resources has been further improved. According to the provisions of China's First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy and China's actual production and consumption situation, China's grain output is not only sufficient for consumption, but also has surpluses.

　　Of course, China's grain production level is still very low, and the grain situation is not abundant. At present, the vast majority of agricultural production in China is still small-scale production, production is very unstable, and output increases slowly. But China is a large country undergoing socialist construction, and the needs of the state and the people for grain are constantly increasing, and the contradiction between the small-scale production of grain and the large-scale production of industry is becoming increasingly significant. After the improvement of farmers' lives, their consumption has increased, and they are no longer eager to sell grain. Therefore, although grain output has increased, the commercial grain provided by farmers has relatively decreased. In order to meet the needs of all parties for grain as much as possible and gradually accumulate necessary grain reserves, the most fundamental way is of course to increase grain output and increase the commercial rate of grain, and actively develop the agricultural cooperative movement. At the same time, it is also necessary to adhere to and improve the work of unified purchase and sale of grain: on the one hand, to ensure that the state has enough grain to meet the needs of all parties; on the other hand, to adhere to a reasonable supply, save grain consumption, and strictly control sales, so that the quantity of grain requisitioned and purchased is stable at a certain level and does not change for a certain period of time.

　　The two provisional measures issued by the State Council play an extremely important role in stimulating farmers' enthusiasm for production, increasing grain production, and better guaranteeing grain needs. The "Provisional Measures for the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" stipulate several principles for unified purchase. That is, production is determined according to the actual output of farmers, and overestimating output is not allowed; the amount of grain used by farmers is deducted according to the actual needs of farmers; the amount of grain purchased is calculated according to a reasonable proportion and is not progressive; and the figures for fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales are further determined to the household. In this way, the purchase can be made more reasonable, and the more farmers increase production, the more grain they can keep. If the agricultural production plan for 1955 can be completed, it is estimated that grain output will increase by 20 billion jin compared with 1954, and the amount purchased by the state will decrease by several billion jin compared with the previous year. In this way, farmers will be able to retain more grain to improve their lives, increase livestock feed, and expand reproduction on this basis.

　　Since the quantity of requisition and purchase has been reduced, and the reduced quantity is stable and unchanged for three years, then strictly controlling the sales volume of grain and implementing reasonable supply has become a decisive issue in future grain work. If the sales volume is not correspondingly compressed and strictly controlled, it may unreasonably increase the quantity of purchases from farmers, making the policy of stabilizing the quantity of requisition and purchase for three years a failure; or it may prevent some reasonable needs of urban and rural people from being guaranteed, resulting in market fluctuations. Both of these situations will seriously affect the worker-peasant alliance and national construction, which must be resolutely avoided.

　　In order to more effectively compress the unreasonable sales volume of grain in urban and rural areas, it is necessary to earnestly implement the provisions of the State Council, combine unified purchase and unified sales in rural areas, divide the boundaries between surplus grain and grain shortage, make unified arrangements, and implement a system of supply with certificates, so as to achieve fair and reasonable supply in appropriate quantities and at appropriate times; implement a system of rationed supply in towns and cities, and formulate appropriate tiered supply standards according to the age, labor intensity, and other conditions of urban residents, and supply with certificates; and give appropriate supply according to the actual needs of industrial and commercial industries. This can effectively guarantee the grain supply of urban and rural people, and effectively save grain and prevent waste.

　　Now our task is to make these systems truly play their due role. To this end, we must carry out extensive and in-depth political and organizational work in towns and cities and in the countryside. All towns and cities must draw sufficient strength, under the unified leadership of the Party and the government, and take a certain amount of time to do a good job in the work of urban grain rationed supply. In the countryside, it is necessary to focus on the development of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, set aside a period of time, mobilize all forces, and do a good job in the work of "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" of grain. For those engaged in grain work, it is necessary to conduct necessary education and training so that they can both understand the policy and understand the practice, and correctly implement these major measures.

　　The implementation of the "Provisional Measures for the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" and the "Provisional Measures for the Rationed Supply of Grain in Towns and Cities" will make China's grain unified purchase and sale work and grain distribution system more reasonable. The people of the whole country should work together to resolutely implement these two measures, consolidate and develop the achievements of grain unified purchase and sale, and strive for new victories on China's grain front!

### 我国粮食工作的重大措施

　　我国粮食工作的重大措施
    今天国务院发布了“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”和“市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”。“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”中并规定从一九五五至一九五六年度起，国家向农民征、购粮食的数字三年不变。这是国家在今年春夏两季实行粮食“定产、定购、定销”和整顿城乡粮食统销工作以后所采取的新的重大措施，是从粮食分配方面调节城乡关系、工农关系和产销关系的重要步骤。贯彻实现这些措施，将进一步巩固工农联盟，有助于我国发展国民经济第一个五年计划的顺利完成。
    两年以来，国家实行粮食统购统销政策获得了巨大的成就。城市和工矿区人民、农村缺粮人民、渔民、盐民、林民、牧民、船民的需要都得到保证，国家建设和国防的需要也得到保证。可以肯定，如果没有粮食的统购统销，全国的市场就不可能继续稳定，一九五四年那样严重的灾荒就无法平稳渡过。我们必须更加坚决、有效地贯彻粮食统购统销政策；对于这个政策的任何怀疑都没有丝毫的根据。
    但是，应该承认，在粮食统购统销的具体工作方面还存在不少的缺点。国家向农民征购的粮食虽然不及粮食产量的三分之一，但因小农经济在我国还占绝对优势，粮食的产、需、余、缺的情况很难完全查清，加上去年发生了严重的灾荒，不得不向非灾区农民多购一点余粮，支援灾区农民的需要；因此，有些地方粮食收购任务分配得不够合理，有的农民应该出售的余粮没有购足，有的农民出售的粮食超过了余粮的界限。粮食统销方面的缺点是对于农村某些缺粮农民供应不足，而主要的缺点则是对于许多不缺粮食的农民供应了粮食，对于某些应该推迟供应粮食的农民提前供应了。城市供应偏宽，管理松懈，浪费粮食的现象也更严重。产生这些缺点和错误的原因，从粮食工作方面进行检查，除了某些工作人员重视征购、轻视统销以外，还因为国家一时没有来得及制定一套必要的具体制度和办法。
    现在国务院发布的这两项暂行办法，不仅足以克服粮食工作方面存在的缺点，更重要的是能够提高广大农民的生产积极性，推动农业合作化运动的发展，促进我国粮食问题的根本解决。
    我国现在的粮食是够吃够用的。解放以后，我国的粮食产量不断提高。一九四九年全国粮食产量每人平均只有原粮三百八十多斤；一九五四年全国每人平均有五百五十多斤。许多材料说明，这个产量水平同我国目前的粮食消费水平是相适应的。这从城市供应宽裕、农民生活普遍改善、农村在粮食统购前后都有大量余粮、农村经济很有发展、牲畜总数不断增加等等情况可以得到充分的证明。解放以前和抗日战争以前，由于反动统治者对人民的剥削和粮食管理上封建割据状态的存在，每年都有几百亿斤粮食不能运出调剂全国的供求。解放以后，国家不惜贴赔，大力调运，暂时不能运出的粮食减少到只有几十亿斤。特别是统购统销实行以后，对粮食资源的利用率更加提高了。按照我国发展国民经济第一个五年计划的规定和我国的实际生产和消费情况，我国的粮食产量不仅够吃够用，并且可以有积余。
    当然，我国粮食生产水平还是很低的，粮食状况并不宽裕。目前我国农业生产绝大部分还是小生产，生产很不稳定，产量增加缓慢。但我国却是一个正在进行社会主义建设的大国，国家和人民对粮食的需要不断提高，粮食的小生产同工业的大生产之间的矛盾日渐显著。农民生活改善以后，他们的消费量增加了，并且不再急于出卖粮食，因此，粮食产量虽然增加了，农民提供的商品粮却相对降低了。为了尽量满足各方面对粮食的需要，并且逐渐积累必要的粮食后备，最根本的办法当然是增加粮食产量并增加粮食的商品率，积极发展农业合作化运动。同时，还必须坚持和改进粮食统购统销工作：一方面保证国家掌握足够应付各方面需要的粮食；一方面坚持合理的供应，节约粮食的消费，严格控制销售量，使粮食征、购数量稳定在一定的水平上，一定时期不再变动。
    国务院发布的两项暂行办法，对于激发农民的生产积极性，更多地增产粮食，更好地保证粮食需要，有极为重大的作用。“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”规定了几项统购的原则。这就是按照农民实际产量定产，不许高估产量；按照农民实际需要扣除农民用粮的数量；按照合理比例计算购粮的数量而不累进；并将定产、定购、定销的数字，进一步地确定到户。这样，就可以使收购更加合理，农民增产越多留粮也就越多。一九五五年农业生产计划如能完成，估计粮食产量将比一九五四年增加二百亿斤，国家收购的数量又比上年度减少了几十亿斤。这样，农民就能够留有较多的粮食，用以改善生活，增加牲畜饲料，并在这个基础上扩大再生产。
    既然征购数量减少了，减少了的数量又稳定三年不变，那末，严格控制粮食的销售量，实行合理供应，就成为今后粮食工作中的一个决定性的问题。如果销量不作相应的压缩和严格的控制，那就可能不合理地增加对农民的收购数量，使征购数量稳定三年的政策落空；或者使城乡人民的某些合理需要得不到保证，结果造成市场的波动。这两种情况都会严重地影响工农联盟和国家建设，这是必须坚决避免的。
    为了更有效地压缩城乡不合理的粮食销售量，必须切实按照国务院的规定，在农村实行统购和统销相结合，划分余粮和缺粮的界限，统一安排，凭证供应的制度，作到公平合理的适量适时的供应；在市镇实行定量供应制度，按照市镇居民年龄大小、劳动轻重等情况，规定适当的分等供应标准，凭证供应；并按照工商行业的实际需要，给以适量的供应。这就可以切实保证城乡人民的粮食供应，并且有效地节约粮食，防止浪费。
    现在我们的任务就是要使这些制度真正发挥应有的作用。为此，我们必须在市镇和乡村进行广泛深入的政治工作和组织工作。各市镇必须抽调足够的力量，在党和政府统一领导下，以一定时间，把城市粮食定量供应工作做好。在农村，必须以发展农业互助合作为中心，划出一段时间，动员全部力量，做好粮食“定产、定购、定销”工作。对于从事粮食工作的人员，要进行必要的教育和训练，使他们既懂得政策，又懂得做法，把这些重大措施正确地贯彻下去。
    “农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”和“市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”的实行，将使我国的粮食统购统销工作和粮食分配制度更加合理。全国人民应当一致努力，坚决执行这两个办法，为巩固和发扬粮食统购统销的成就，为争取我国粮食战线上的新的胜利而奋斗！
