    Do a Good Job in Rural Health Work
    Ouyang Jing, Director of the Rural Medical and Preventive Department of the Ministry of Health
    The current basic task of rural work is to carry out an agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual assistance and cooperation, and to gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture. In order to ensure the smooth completion of this task, doing a good job in rural health work and improving the people's health is an indispensable and important task. Due to the rapid development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement and the gradual improvement of the farmers' material lives, farmers' demands for medical care and health are becoming increasingly urgent. The gradual collectivization of agricultural production makes it possible to gradually incorporate health work into production plans, rely on production organizations, and also provides certain economic conveniences. Therefore, our health workers, especially rural health workers, should closely integrate with the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement and do a good job in rural health work.
    In the past few years, health work has achieved certain successes in serving agricultural production. Public health institutions at the county and district levels and mass-run medical and health undertakings have gradually developed and improved year by year. Health departments at all levels have generally paid attention to the fact that rural health work must be production-oriented, and during the busy farming seasons, they must go deep into the fields to serve farmers and serve remote rural areas. Many agricultural production cooperatives have established relatively fixed medical relationships with local health institutions, and have focused on establishing mass health organizations within the cooperatives to carry out regular health activities, thereby reducing the incidence of illness among cooperative members. However, rural health work still lags far behind objective requirements, manifested in: county hospitals and district health centers being of low quality and insufficient in quantity, failing to play their core guiding role in rural health work; the vast social medical forces, especially traditional Chinese medicine, not being given overall arrangements according to their specific circumstances, so that there is still great potential that has not been realized; due to the lack of unified planning and strong leadership for newly established health institutions, many areas have the phenomenon of health institutions being mutually exclusive and public and private health institutions competing for business, while other areas still have medical blank spots.
    Therefore, it is necessary to rationally deploy and make overall arrangements for the public and private medical and health forces in rural areas, actively improve the quality of county hospitals and district health centers, strengthen their technical guidance for rural health work, rely on the masses, and steadily develop rural medical and health undertakings on the basis of agricultural production development.
    Among the medical personnel in rural areas, except for a small number working in public health institutions, about one-fifth have been organized into joint clinics, and a very small number have joined agricultural production cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives as health workers in the medical departments. Most are individual practitioners. The health departments should provide education and assistance to the above-mentioned health and medical forces, gradually make overall arrangements for their work, enable them to work regularly under the leadership and supervision of public health institutions, and guide them to continuously improve their work style and improve their professional level. The method of overall arrangement must be carefully considered in light of the development of the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement, and must never be done based on subjective wishes. For example, in areas where mutual aid groups and individual farmers are in the majority, the main consideration should be to adopt the method of having local joint clinics and individual practitioners be responsible for specific areas and villages, responsible for medical work in a certain area, as well as responsible for infectious disease reporting, vaccination, health education, and guiding the masses to carry out patriotic health campaigns (of course, local residents can still seek medical treatment from doctors they trust). For remote areas lacking medicine, the health department should plan to organize manpower to carry out mobile medical work (reasonable remuneration should be given when organizing individual practitioners to participate). For agricultural production cooperatives, efforts should be made to guarantee them in terms of medicine. Since most of the agricultural production cooperatives currently established are medium-sized and small-sized, in addition to adopting methods such as assigning responsibility by area or cooperative and implementing mobile medical care, they can also organize them to sign medical and health contracts with nearby health centers, joint clinics, and individual practitioners, who will regularly go to the agricultural production cooperatives to see cooperative members, publicize health knowledge, and guide health activities within the cooperatives. In large cooperatives with a solid foundation, with the consent of the cooperative members and the approval of the local administrative leading organs, public welfare funds can be used to set up medical and health rooms (or jointly run by several villages and cooperatives) to be responsible for the medical and health work of the cooperative members and nearby individual farmers. The local health department must effectively and uniformly lead the health institutions of state-owned farms in various places in terms of business; generally, local state-owned farms do not need to set up special medical institutions because of their small scale, but the local health department should designate nearby medical and health institutions to serve them by signing contracts.
    In order to appropriately meet the medical needs of remote areas and reduce the contradictions between public and private health forces, in the future, rural public health institutions (mainly district health centers) should first develop in ethnic minority areas, old revolutionary base areas, and mountainous areas. If there is already a certain health force locally, there is no need to rush to establish them. In some areas, supply and marketing cooperatives have medical institutions attached to them. These medical institutions should be under the unified leadership of the local health department in terms of medical and health business. In the future, in areas where there are already district health centers and joint clinics, the supply and marketing cooperatives should mainly undertake drug supply and marketing work, and it is generally not advisable to establish medical institutions to avoid business conflicts with local medical institutions. According to the experience of the past few years, rural joint clinics are a good organizational form for exerting the strength of medical personnel, and can still be appropriately organized in rural areas in the future; however, they should be located in market towns or larger villages with a relatively concentrated population. If there are too many doctors in some areas, some doctors can be organized and mobilized, under the principle of voluntariness, to go to areas lacking medicine to organize joint clinics. Their activities should be adapted to the dispersed rural population and implement decentralized consultations, and must never be concentrated for consultations as in cities.

    On the basis of rationally deploying and making overall arrangements for rural health forces, in order to make health work effectively serve agricultural production, it is also necessary to improve and develop mass health organizations and carry out regular mass health activities. The Party Central Committee's "Resolution on the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives" has pointed out that a production plan should be gradually established (this plan should include a cultural and health improvement plan), and a responsibility system for production and cultural, health, and other aspects of life management should be established. In the past two years, many agricultural production cooperatives have established health organizations according to production organizations, and local health departments have also begun to train health workers who do not leave production for agricultural production cooperatives, to be responsible for health publicity within the cooperatives, guiding the development of health activities, and first aid. Experience has proven that this approach has a very good effect, improved the health conditions within the cooperative, reduced the incidence of diseases, and played a good role in production. In the future, agricultural production cooperatives should pay attention to this work and actively seek the help of local health departments to support the health work within the cooperative. Rural health institutions in various places should pay more attention to and strengthen the regular guidance of health organizations (health workers, midwives, etc.) and childcare organizations within agricultural production cooperatives. In places where agricultural production cooperatives have not been established, mass health activities should be led through the original mass health organizations.
    In order to ensure the smooth development of rural health work, it is necessary to earnestly rectify and improve the work of existing county hospitals and district health centers, so that they can better guide the work of rural health institutions and medical personnel in terms of business technology, and play their core guiding role in rural health work. To this end, health departments in various places should first do a good job in ideological education for the medical staff of county hospitals and district health centers, improve their socialist consciousness, strengthen their sense of responsibility, continuously improve their work methods, and earnestly implement the principles and policies of health work. The key to doing a good job in the ideological education of medical staff is to implement the Party's policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals. At present, the leading staff of health departments and hospitals in many areas still lack a correct understanding of the Party's policy, have not seriously and earnestly implemented this policy, and there are different shortcomings and biases such as replacing in-depth and meticulous ideological education with simple and crude methods, or indiscriminately accommodating and letting things go, which should be quickly corrected. Secondly, it is necessary to actively improve the professional and technical level of medical personnel. Methods such as running refresher courses and correspondence courses should be adopted to absorb county and district health personnel to study in provincial or prefectural hospitals in rotation; provincial or prefectural hospitals should also regularly send people to counties and districts for technical guidance; at the same time, attention should also be paid to strengthening regular professional study and quickly improving their technical level. Provincial or prefectural health departments should also plan to transfer and supplement a part of high- and intermediate-level technical personnel with better skills to work in county and district health institutions; for some personnel with extremely poor political quality and skills who are not suitable for doing medical and health work, appropriate handling should be carried out under the unified leadership of the local party and government organs.
    Rural health work can only be effective if it is carried out under the unified leadership of the Party and the government, relying on the masses and the cooperation of all parties, and working together. Health departments at all levels should take the initiative to report the situation to the local party and government leading organs, put forward plans to cooperate with the central work in each period, and obtain the leadership and support of the party and government organs. Party committees at all levels should also strengthen the regular leadership and supervision of rural health work so that it can correctly complete the major task of ensuring agricultural production.

    做好农村卫生工作
    卫生部乡村医疗预防司司长　欧阳竞
    当前农村工作的基本任务是开展以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动，逐步完成对农业的社会主义改造。为了保证这一任务的顺利完成，做好农村卫生工作，提高人民健康水平，是一项不可缺少的重要工作。由于农业互助合作运动的迅速发展，农民的物质生活逐步改善，农民们对于医药卫生的要求日益迫切；而农业生产的逐步集体化，又使卫生工作有可能逐步纳入生产计划，依靠生产组织进行，而且在经济上也有了一定的便利条件。因此，我们卫生工作人员，特别是农村卫生工作人员应当紧密结合农业互助合作运动，做好农村卫生工作。
    几年来，卫生工作在为农业生产服务方面是有一定成绩的。县、区公立卫生机构和群众举办的医疗卫生事业逐年有所发展和提高；各级卫生部门一般也已注意到农村卫生工作必须面向生产，在农忙季节要深入田间为农民服务，为偏僻乡村服务；不少农业生产合作社已经同当地卫生机构建立了比较固定的医疗关系，并重点地建立了社内群众性的卫生组织，开展了经常性的卫生活动，社员患病率因而降低。但是，农村卫生工作仍然大大落后于客观的要求，表现在：县卫生院和区卫生所质量很低，数量不足，未能发挥其在农村卫生工作中的核心指导作用；对于广大的社会医疗力量，特别是中医，没有根据他们的具体情况进行统筹安排，以致还有很大的潜力没有发挥；对于新设的卫生机构由于缺乏统一计划和有力的领导，许多地区存在着卫生机构门户对立、公私卫生机构互争业务的现象，而另外有些地区至今还是医药空白点。
    因此，必须合理部署和统筹安排乡村公私医疗卫生力量，积极提高县卫生院、区卫生所的质量，加强它们对乡村卫生工作的业务技术指导，依靠群众，在农业生产发展的基础上，稳步地发展农村医疗卫生事业。
    乡村中的医务人员，除一小部分在公立卫生机构工作，有约五分之一人数已组织联合诊所，极少数人已加入农业生产合作社和供销合作社医药部担任卫生工作外，大部分是个体开业医。对以上卫生医疗力量，卫生部门应当给以教育、帮助，逐步统筹安排他们的工作，并使他们能经常在公立卫生机构的领导和监督下进行工作，引导他们不断地改进工作作风和提高业务水平。统筹安排的办法，必须结合农业生产互助合作运动的发展情况作周密的考虑，绝不能凭主观愿望办事。如在互助组和个体农民占多数的地区，主要应当考虑采取使当地联合诊所和个体开业医实行分片分村负责的办法，负责一定地区内的医疗工作，以及负责传染病报告、预防接种、卫生宣传、指导群众开展爱国卫生运动等工作（当然，当地居民仍然可以找他们所信仰的医生治病）。对于医药缺乏的偏僻地区，卫生部门应当有计划地组织人力进行巡回医疗工作（组织个体开业医参加时应给以合理的报酬）。对于农业生产合作社，应当尽力予以医药方面的保证。由于目前成立的农业生产合作社大多是中、小型的社，除了可以采取分片分社负责和实行巡回医疗等办法外，也可以组织他们跟附近的卫生所、联合诊所、个体开业医订立医疗保健合同，由他们定期到农业生产合作社给社员看病，宣传卫生知识，指导社内的卫生活动。在基础巩固的大社，经社员同意和当地行政领导机关批准，可用公益金设立医疗卫生室（也可联村联社合办），负责社员和附近个体农民的医疗卫生工作。对于各地国营农场的卫生机构，当地卫生部门必须在业务上切实地统一领导起来；一般地方国营农场因为规模较小，不必专设医疗机构，但当地卫生部门应指定附近医疗卫生机构采取订立合同等办法为其服务。
    为了适当满足偏僻地区的医药要求和减少公私卫生力量的矛盾，今后农村公立卫生机构（主要是区卫生所），首先应当在少数民族地区、老根据地区和山区发展，如当地已有一定的卫生力量，即不必急于建立。有些地区供销合作社附设有医疗机构，这些医疗机构在医疗卫生业务上应受当地卫生部门统一领导。今后在已有区卫生所、联合诊所的地区，供销合作社主要担任药品供销工作，一般不宜再建立医疗机构，以避免跟当地医疗机构的业务发生矛盾。根据几年来的经验，乡村联合诊所是发挥医务人员力量的较好的组织形式，今后在乡村中仍可适当组织；但应设在人口比较集中的集镇或较大的乡村中。有些地区的医生多了，可以组织和动员一些医生在自愿原则下到缺乏医药的地区去组织联合诊所，其活动方式应当适应农村人口分散的情况，实行分散应诊，绝不能如在城市中那样集中应
  诊。
      在合理部署、统筹安排乡村卫生力量的基础上，
  要使卫生工作有效地为农业生产服务，还必须健全和发展群众性的卫生组织，开展经常性的群众卫生活动。党中央“关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”中已经指出：应逐步建立生产计划（这一计划应包括文化和卫生的改进计划），以及建立生产和文化、卫生等生活管理的责任制度。近二年来，不少农业生产合作社已按生产组织建立了卫生组织，当地卫生部门也已开始为农业生产合作社训练不脱离生产的保健员，担任社内卫生宣传、指导开展卫生活动和急救等工作。经验证明：这种做法的效果很好，改善了社内的卫生状况，减少了疾病的发生，对生产起了良好的作用。今后农业生产合作社应当重视这一工作，主动争取当地卫生部门的帮助，对社内卫生工作予以支持。各地的农村卫生机构更应重视和加强对农业生产合作社内卫生组织（保健员、接生员等）、托儿组织的经常指导。在没有建立农业生产合作社的地方，应当通过原有的群众性的卫生组织，领导开展群众性的卫生活动。
    为了保证农村卫生工作的顺利开展，必须切实整顿和提高现有县卫生院、区卫生所的工作，使它们能够更好地在业务技术上指导农村卫生机构和医务人员的工作，发挥其在农村卫生工作中的核心指导作用。为此，各地卫生部门首先应作好县卫生院、区卫生所中医务人员的思想教育工作，提高他们的社会主义觉悟，加强工作责任心，不断改进工作方法，切实贯彻卫生工作的方针和原则。做好医务人员思想教育工作的关键是贯彻党对知识分子的团结改造政策。目前很多地区的卫生科、卫生院的领导工作人员还缺乏对党的这一政策的正确理解，还没有认真严肃地贯彻这一政策，存在着以简单粗暴的方式方法代替深入细致的思想教育工作，或无原则地迁就、放任不管等不同的缺点和偏向，这些都是应当迅速纠正的。其次，必须积极提高医务人员的业务技术水平。应该采取举办进修班、函授班的办法，吸收县区卫生人员轮流到省或专署医院学习；省或专署医院也应定期派人下县、区进行技术指导；同时，还应当注意加强经常性的业务学习，迅速提高他们的技术水平。省或专署卫生部门也应有计划地调配和充实一部分技术较好的高、中级技术人员到县、区卫生机构工作；对于某些政治品质和技术极差、不适宜于做医疗卫生工作的人员，应在当地党政机关统一领导下进行适当处理。
    农村卫生工作只有在党和政府的统一领导下，依靠群众和各方面的配合，通力合作，才能收到效果。各级卫生部门应当主动地向当地党政领导机关汇报情况，提出每一时期配合中心工作的计划，取得党政机关的领导和支持。各级党委也应当加强对农村卫生工作的经常的领导和监督，使其能够正确地完成保证农业生产的重大任务。
