Large Quantities of Xinjiang Wool Shipped to Shanghai

　　The workers of the state-owned Xinjiang Gongnais Breeding Sheep Farm and the Suiding Pasture are currently busy packing 50,000 kilograms of Xinjiang wool, a bumper harvest this year, to be shipped to Shanghai to support textile factories in production.

　　The fineness of Xinjiang wool is equivalent to that of imported high-grade Australian wool. Its tensile strength is suitable for textile requirements, and its price is lower than that of imported Australian wool. The Chongqing Joint State-Private China Wool Textile Factory once used Xinjiang wool to weave first-class wool gabardine with very good quality.

　　新疆大批羊毛运往上海
    国营新疆巩乃斯种羊场和绥定牧场的职工，最近正忙着把今年丰收的五万公斤新疆羊羊毛打包运往上海支援纺织工厂生产。
    新疆羊羊毛的细度相当于进口的澳大利亚羊高级羊毛，拉力适合纺织要求、价格也较进口澳大利亚羊羊毛为低。重庆公私合营中国毛纺织厂，曾经用新疆羊羊毛织成一等毛哔叽，质量很好。
