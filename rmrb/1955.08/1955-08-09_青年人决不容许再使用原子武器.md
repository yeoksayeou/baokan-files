    Young People Will Never Allow the Use of Atomic Weapons Again
    By Our Reporter Feng Zhidan
    I will never forget a young man from Hiroshima named Honbo Yukio, who pinned a commemorative olive leaf, symbolizing life, on my chest. He was a victim of the first atomic bomb dropped by the United States in Asia ten years ago. His wife was also a victim. Before 1945, she was a beautiful and cheerful girl, but the atomic bomb ruined her face. She became depressed and even wanted to commit suicide. Later, reason told her that she should live on and denounce the cruelty of using atomic weapons to all mankind. Honbo Yukio told me that Hiroshima was once beautiful, with seven small rivers flowing through the city, and weeping willows swaying along the banks, a picturesque scene. But the atomic bomb destroyed the city, and Hiroshima has not yet healed from the wounds of the atomic bomb explosion. When Honbo Yukio left his hometown to come to Warsaw to participate in the festival, his wife entrusted him to tell the young people of the world about the disaster in Hiroshima, and his old father urged him to do more for peace. Many families in Hiroshima donated money to support him in coming to the Warsaw Festival to appeal for the will of the people of Hiroshima.
    On August 6, while the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs was being held in Hiroshima, at a rally in Warsaw of more than 20,000 young people from different countries against the threat of atomic war, Honbo Yukio made a strong appeal to the world: "Young people all over the world, unite to ban atomic weapons, stop war preparations, and fight for peace, international cooperation, and a future of human happiness!" A song composed by a Japanese young composer, "Never Tolerate the Atomic Bomb!" reverberated through the venue, expressing the firm will of the Japanese people to demand the prohibition of atomic weapons.
    The fact that youth representatives from various countries gathered in the capital of the festival on the tenth anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima shows that the desire of young people all over the world to oppose atomic war and demand international peace and cooperation is strong, and their strength is powerful. Bernini, Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, said at the meeting: "We young people must unite with millions of people all over the world to eliminate the threat of atomic war and promote international peace and cooperation." At this rally, I met a West German mechanic who said: "West German youth oppose German remilitarization. We need life and bread, we don't need American atomic cannons." I also met an Irish construction worker who said: "In the name of a construction worker, I firmly oppose the atomic war that would massively destroy human civilization." Similarly, a young Nigerian black man, Akinkumi, told me: "Every young person on the African continent demands the prohibition of atomic weapons." During the conference, an American college student, Jolie, and the Chinese youth representative Liu Gongcheng were discussing issues of peace and war. They agreed on the point that Taiwan is Chinese territory and the United States has no reason to occupy Taiwan. When talking about atomic war, Jolie said: "As a member of mankind, of course I oppose atomic war, and I also oppose all wars." Jolie stated that he is not a socialist, but he needs peace. I found that Jolie also wore an olive leaf commemorative badge given by Honbo Yukio on his chest.
    Listen! In the square of the Old City of Warsaw, young people from all over the world are making loud voices against the threat of atomic war. The peace singer Paul Robeson, in distant North America, broadcast Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" from his Ninth Symphony to the conference via tape recording. Young people are united for the joy of life and are fighting for the happiness of life. The conference sent a telegram to the conference being held in Hiroshima. Young people demand the prohibition of atomic weapons, demand peace, mutual understanding, and international cooperation.
    It is true that young people, regardless of nationality, class, or ideology, have the same desire for peace and friendship, especially the same feeling against the recurrence of the Hiroshima incident. Here, young people from all over the world are carrying out more than 60 kinds of friendship activities every day. They hold parties and various meetings, they perform literary and artistic performances and competitions, and they carry out sports competitions. In the streets, squares, theaters, and stadiums of Warsaw, you can always see young people who were originally very unfamiliar becoming friends at first sight. They exchange addresses and agree to communicate with each other. On the morning of August 5, young people from all over the world went to the Cultural Park next to the Vistula River to plant tender green friendship trees with their own hands. These young trees will grow and develop in the soil of this city of youth, becoming a historical witness to the eternal friendship of young people all over the world.
    In order to defend life and defend youth, the unanimous call issued on August 6 is: Never allow the use of atomic weapons again.

    青年人决不容许再使用原子武器
    本报记者　冯之丹
    我永远也不能忘记一个名叫本保幸雄的广岛青年，他把一枚象征生命的橄榄叶纪念章别在我的胸前。他是十年前美国在亚洲扔下的第一颗原子弹的受害者。他的妻子也是受害者。一九四五年以前，她曾经是一个美丽而愉快的女孩子，但是原子弹毁坏了她的面容。她变得消沉，甚至想要自杀。后来理智告诉她，她应该活下去，向全人类控诉使用原子武器的残忍。本保幸雄告诉我，广岛曾经是美丽的，七条小河流过这个城市，沿岸垂柳轻拂，景色如画。但是原子弹毁坏了这座城市，直到现在广岛还未治好原子弹爆炸的创伤。当本保幸雄离开他的故乡到华沙来参加联欢节时，他的妻子托付他把广岛的灾难告诉全世界的年青人，他的老父叮咛他要多为和平出力。广岛的许多家庭都捐钱，集资支持他到华沙联欢节上来申诉广岛人民的意志。
    八月六日在广岛举行着禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会的同时，在华沙二万多名来自不同国家的青年的反对原子战争威胁的集会上，本保幸雄向全世界发出了强烈的呼吁：“全世界青年联合起来为禁止原子武器、制止战争准备，为和平、国际合作和人类欢乐的未来而斗争吧！”一个日本青年作曲家创作的“绝不容忍原子弹！”的歌声在会场上震荡着，它表达着日本人民要求禁止原子武器的坚决意志。
    在这广岛被炸十周年的日子，各国青年代表在联欢节的都城集会这一事实表明，全世界的年青人反对原子战争、要求国际和平和合作的愿望是强烈的，他们的力量是强大的。世界民主青年联盟主席柏尼尼在会上说：“我们青年要同全世界千百万人民团结一致，消除原子战争的威胁，促进国际间的和平与合作。”在这个集会上，我遇到一个西德的机械工人，他说：“西德青年反对德国重新军国主义化，我们需要生活和面包，我们不需要美国的原子炮。”我也遇到一个爱尔兰的建筑工人，他说：“我以一个建筑工人的名义坚决反对大规模毁灭人类文明的原子战争。”同样，一个尼日利亚的青年黑人阿金求比告诉我：“非洲大陆上的每个年青人都要求禁止原子武器。”大会进行时，美国的大学生裘利同中国青年代表刘公诚在谈论和平与战争的问题。他们对于台湾是中国领土、美国毫无理由占领台湾这一点上意见是一致的。谈到原子战争时，裘利表示：“作为人类的一分子，我当然反对原子战争，我也反对一切战争。”裘利声明说：他不是社会主义者，但是他需要和平。我发现裘利的胸前也别着一颗本保幸雄赠送的橄榄叶纪念章。
    请听！在华沙旧城的广场上，全世界的年青人发出了反对原子战争威胁的嘹亮的声音。和平歌手保罗·罗伯逊在遥远的北美通过录音带向大会播唱着贝多芬第九交响乐中的“欢乐颂”。青年们为了生命的欢乐而团聚，为了生活的幸福而斗争。大会向正在广岛举行的大会发出通电。年青人要求禁止原子武器、要求和平、相互了解和国际合作。
    这是千真万确的，年青人不论属于什么国籍、不分阶层和思想信仰，要求和平和友谊，特别是反对广岛事件重演的心情是相同的。在这里，来自世界各国的青年每天进行着六十多种友谊的活动。他们举行着联欢会和各种会见，他们进行着文艺表演和比赛，他们展开着体育竞赛，在华沙的街头、广场、剧院和运动场上，你随时都可以看到本来是非常陌生的年青人一见如故。他们互换住址，相约彼此通讯。八月五日上午，世界各国的青年都曾到维斯杜拉河旁的文化公园亲手栽下嫩绿的友谊树。这些幼树将要在这青春之城的土壤上发育成长，成为全世界青年永恒友谊的历史的见证。
    为了保卫生命和保卫青春，在八月六日这一天发出的一致呼声是：决不容许再使用原子武器。
                          （八月八日自华沙）
