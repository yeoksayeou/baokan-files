Xinhua News Agency, August 12th: The Syngman Rhee clique's threatening actions to force the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to withdraw from South Korea are still continuing. Large numbers of thugs continue to surround the residences of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in the five ports of Incheon, Busan, Gangneung, Gunsan, and Daegu. In Seoul, there were also demonstrations against the commission.

The Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command and Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Far East Command, General Lemnitzer, once again rushed from Tokyo to Seoul on the 10th, and held secret talks with Syngman Rhee on the 11th together with U.S. Far East Army Commander and Eighth Army Commander General White and U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Lacey. According to International News Service, Lemnitzer informed Syngman Rhee of the U.S. attitude expressed in the statement issued by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles on the 10th. As previously reported, Dulles stated in the statement that the United States was "sympathetic" to Syngman Rhee's position. Now, according to United Press International, citing "highly qualified sources" in Seoul, Americans and Syngman Rhee "see eye-to-eye" on the point of "expelling" the Polish and Czechoslovakian members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from South Korea.

Shortly after Lemnitzer and Syngman Rhee began their talks, the Syngman Rhee government issued a statement reiterating its arrogant demand to "drive out" the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from South Korea. When issuing this statement, Syngman Rhee government spokesman Ko Hong-ki also openly incited demonstrations threatening the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. He said, "We are willing to risk our lives to achieve this," and also said, "Complete calm cannot be expected in such demonstrations."

Also on the 11th, White inspected Wolmido Island, the location of the Incheon inspection team, which is currently surrounded by thugs from the Syngman Rhee group. Beforehand, this matter was publicized as part of the American effort to "dissuade" Syngman Rhee, just like the Lemnitzer-Syngman Rhee talks. During his inspection of Wolmido Island, White personally encountered the demonstrating thugs blocking the causeway to the island. However, this American general, who is responsible for the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, did not take any measures to stop the thugs' atrocities.

### 李承晚继续威胁中立国监察委员会

    李承晚继续威胁中立国监察委员会
    新华社十二日讯　李承晚集团妄图迫使中立国监察委员会退出南朝鲜的威胁行动仍旧在继续进行。大批暴徒依然包围着仁川、釜山、江陵、群山、大邱等五个口岸的中立国监察委员会的驻地。在汉城，也发生了反对委员会的示威。
    联合国军总司令、远东美军总司令兰尼兹尔在十日再次从东京赶到汉城，并且在十一日和美国远东陆军司令兼第八军军长怀特、美国驻南朝鲜大使拉西一道同李承晚举行了秘密会谈。据国际新闻社透露，兰尼兹尔把美国国务卿杜勒斯在十日发表的声明中所表明的美国态度告诉了李承晚。前已报道，杜勒斯在声明中表示美国对李承晚的立场是“同情”的。现在，据合众社引汉城“极有资格的人士”的谈话说，在把中立国监察委员会波兰委员和捷克斯洛伐克委员从南朝鲜“驱逐”出去这一点上，美国人和李承晚“在看法上是一致的”。
    就在兰尼兹尔和李承晚开始会谈后不久，李承晚政府发表了一项声明，重申它的要把中立国监察委员会“赶出”南朝鲜的狂妄要求。李承晚政府发言人葛弘基在发表这个声明时还公开煽动举行威胁中立国监察委员会的示威。他说，“我们愿意冒生命的危险来实现这件事”，还说“不能期望在这种示威中完全平静”。
    同样在十一日，怀特视察了现在李承晚集团暴徒包围中的仁川视察小组所在地——月尾岛。事前，这件事情被宣传为和兰尼兹尔—李承晚会谈一样，是美国“劝阻”李承晚的努力的一部分。怀特在视察月尾岛时亲自遇到了封锁着这个岛屿的堤道的示威暴徒。但是，这位对执行朝鲜停战协定负有责任的美国将军竟没有采取任何措施来制止暴徒们的暴行。
