Vigorously Implement Comprehensive Economy and Overcome All Waste

    Strengthen Fiscal Supervision and Give Full Play to the Effectiveness of Basic Construction Investment
    Ma Nanfeng, President of the People's Construction Bank of China
    In 1955, among the budgetary allocations for economic and cultural construction in our country, basic construction expenditures accounted for the largest proportion, and the allocation figures exceeded those of any previous year. Supervising the economical use of this huge amount of funds under the premise of completing the national plan is not only an important key to the successful realization of the 1955 national budget, but will also guarantee the planned and proportional continuous growth of our national economy. Therefore, strengthening fiscal supervision over basic construction and vigorously implementing comprehensive economy and overcoming all waste in basic construction has become a very important issue at present.
    In the past few years, basic construction work has made great progress in all aspects. Many newly added fixed assets have been put into production and begun to be utilized, and engineering costs have been reduced successively. Thanks to the active measures taken by many construction units and construction enterprises to improve operation and management, although the basic construction labor productivity quota for 1955 has been increased compared with the past, the quota for industrial and civil building design budgets has been reduced by 2.5 percent respectively on the basis of the 1954 quota. Many construction units have also broken through the labor productivity quota and overfulfilled the cost reduction plan.
    However, on the other hand, the phenomenon of not paying attention to the economical use of funds in basic construction is still very common. First of all, it is manifested in the generally high preparation of construction budgets. Among the construction budgets that the People's Construction Bank of China has reviewed from January to May this year, those not calculated according to the budgeted value accounted for 87.98 percent, and the overestimation of value averaged 8.39 percent of the original budget value. The phenomenon of overestimation in individual projects is even more prominent. For example, in the reinforced concrete project of the Shijiazhuang New Power Plant, the amount of reinforcing steel used per cubic meter in the budget was more than five times higher than the quota. The general overestimation of construction budgets not only unreasonably increases the burden of the national budget, but also covers up various wastes in construction, resulting in a large loss of construction funds.
    The excessive proportion of non-productive buildings, the excessively high construction standards, and the blind pursuit of beautiful decorations have also greatly increased project costs. According to the results of a pilot review of the construction budgets of four construction units by the Beijing Branch of the People's Construction Bank of China, the cost increase due to the pursuit of form in the design accounted for more than 8 percent of the original budget value.
    Another manifestation of not paying attention to the economical use of funds in basic construction is the failure to follow the prescribed procedures, the lack of attention to operation and management, and the serious backlog and waste. According to incomplete statistics from the People's Construction Bank of China as of the end of May, the value of backlogged materials reached more than 350 million yuan, and the various losses and wastes that have been identified have reached 33.43 million yuan. Many projects start construction without authorization before the plan has been approved, or start preparing materials before the design has been determined, so that the purchased materials often do not meet the actual needs, or the materials are prepared too early and too much, resulting in a large backlog, while the required materials are not available for purchase. Some projects start preparation too early, resulting in a large loss and waste of administrative expenses. Some construction units blindly carry out construction regardless of actual needs, or build projects outside the plan, which also causes great waste. Individual construction units even use basic construction funds to purchase a large number of unnecessary supplies.
    The failure to pay attention to the economical use of funds in basic construction is also reflected in the fact that construction units have great potential for internal resources, but they have not been fully mobilized; construction enterprises do not pay attention to increasing internal accumulation, and illegally occupy budget funds. According to statistics on 838 construction units, the surplus funds that can be used this year reach more than 240 million yuan. In addition to a portion of the normal reserves from the previous year for this year, most of these surplus funds are basic construction allocations allocated by the national budget over the years, which have been backlogged because they have not been invested in projects. The surplus funds that can be mobilized by some construction units even exceed the total investment amount for the entire year of 1955. For example, the surplus funds that can be used by the 102nd Engineering Office of the East China Hydropower Engineering Bureau in 1955 are equivalent to 123 percent of the total financial expenditures for the whole year. Many construction units often do not pay attention to fully mobilizing huge internal resources. On the one hand, they backlog a large amount of funds, and on the other hand, they reach out to the state for budget allocations. Many of the surplus funds that cannot be used this year listed in the financial revenue and expenditure plans of many construction units can also be used. For example, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant originally listed materials worth more than 130,000 yuan that could not be used this year, but in fact more than 49,000 yuan had already been used in the first quarter. Some construction units often fail to turn in the profits, depreciation funds, etc. that have been accumulated on time, and illegally occupy them for a long time.
    The reasons for the above problems are, of course, due to our lack of experience in large-scale economic construction, and there are certain objective difficulties; the appropriation supervision work of the People's Construction Bank of China also has many shortcomings, and has not taken effective measures to resolutely stop the losses and wastes in basic construction and the unreasonable use of funds. However, more importantly, it is because many basic construction departments lack a clear economic point of view. Some people believe that "it is easier to get things done with more money," and always require the construction budget to be calculated more broadly, thinking that "the surplus will be the state's anyway." They often emphasize that they have no experience and forgive themselves. Some are afraid of losing money and failing to complete the task. Or they think that a larger budget can be used more "conveniently," so as to avoid requesting additional funding in the future; they even hope to "make a profit" from it to enrich the activity funds of their departments. Under the control of these wrong ideas, the state budget must allocate more funds than actually needed to these construction units, so that they can make up for waste, avoid losing money, and use it "conveniently." In this way, the state has to pay the price of postponing or reducing many necessary projects.
    The unit cost of non-productive buildings in many construction units exceeds the standard, and the area of construction also exceeds the actual needs. This practice of deviating from the current economic level and people's living standards is another concrete manifestation of the lack of a clear economic point of view in basic construction. The improvement of living standards must be based on the development of production. If the standard of non-productive buildings deviates from the basis of production development and exceeds the speed of labor productivity improvement, then how much funds can be used to build factories and mines? Of course, non-productive buildings should also pay attention to quality, but they must not deviate from the current objective conditions.
    Another non-economic point of view in basic construction is that as long as the task is completed, it is the greatest saving, and it does not matter if there is some loss and waste. And they often use the particularity of key projects as an excuse to defend the losses and wastes they have caused. These comrades have forgotten that in addition to completing the project task, we have another important task, which is to vigorously implement comprehensive economy in all departments, resolutely overcome all waste, and accumulate more construction funds for the country.
    The non-economic point of view in basic construction is also reflected in the attitude of many construction units towards surplus funds. Some people think: "There is a lot of surplus funds and a large backlog of materials because of plan changes and other objective reasons. We can only complete the task with additional allocations." Some people, when there is a slight temporary difficulty in the turnover of working capital, clamor everywhere that there is not enough funds and ask for increased allocations. But they did not think that the funds in the national budget have a certain purpose and cannot be allowed to be backlogged for a long time. In fact, many construction units and construction enterprises have paid attention to the full mobilization of internal resources and taken measures to actively deal with backlogs, which not only reduced budget expenditures, but also turned in surplus funds.
    It is very obvious that these non-economic viewpoints are completely contrary to the road of socialist industrialization. The way to overcome this non-economic viewpoint is to resolutely implement the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, design according to the principle of "applicable, economical, and beautiful under possible conditions," accurately prepare construction budgets; thoroughly investigate the internal resources that can be used, fully utilize them, and take effective measures to actively improve operation and management, eliminate all losses and wastes, and continuously reduce project costs. The comrades of the People's Construction Bank of China must further clearly recognize the importance of our responsibilities, overcome all negative thoughts of not daring to supervise basic construction investment, and strengthen fiscal supervision over basic construction.
    The People's Construction Bank of China must first vigorously review construction budgets, stop all losses and wastes, and supervise the reduction of project costs. For construction budgets, not only should the overestimated prices be removed according to the quota, but special attention should also be paid to whether the cost of non-productive buildings exceeds the prescribed standards. For extravagance, waste, and unnecessary construction, equipment, and purchases in the design, we should actively put forward opinions and supervise improvement. At the same time, we must also supervise the construction units to prepare a practical and feasible plan to reduce project costs on the basis of the budget after review, in accordance with the prescribed indicators, and take concrete measures to ensure the realization of the plan. A resolute struggle must be launched against all losses and wastes in basic construction; not only must it be effectively stopped, but it must also be vigorously exposed in various ways to create strong public opinion to facilitate supervision and correction.
    Secondly, it is necessary to supervise construction units to vigorously tap potential forces in basic construction, fully utilize internal resources, accelerate capital turnover, and reduce fiscal expenditures. For the surplus funds of construction units, not only should they be urged to thoroughly investigate the actual surplus situation, but they should also be supervised to include the surplus funds that can be used this year in the financial revenue and expenditure plan to offset the budget allocations for this year. The materials available for this year's projects in the surplus funds should be used as much as possible; those that cannot be used for this year's projects should be sold at a price; the debts owed to us by others must be recovered on a regular basis, and the debts we owe to others should also be paid off in a timely manner. For backlogged materials, construction units and construction enterprises must be supervised to carry out adjustment and disposal, and vigorously prevent the generation of new backlogs. At the same time, it is necessary to supervise construction units to actively improve labor organization, improve labor productivity, fully use machinery and equipment, continuously tap potential forces, and increase internal accumulation of basic construction.
    Again, in order to supervise the economical use of basic construction funds, it is also necessary to strictly implement plan discipline, budget discipline, and financial discipline. All basic construction work must be carried out in accordance with the approved plans and designs, and no payments shall be made for projects that have not been included in the plan or that are not constructed according to the design. If some projects urgently need to start construction before the plan and design have been approved, they must also go through certain approval procedures in accordance with the regulations. All expenses of basic construction must comply with the provisions of the plan and budget, and the phenomenon of over-budget allocations must never be allowed to occur. At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen settlement work, especially for project payments, it is necessary to earnestly implement the settlement in accordance with the system regulations, based on the principle of "how much money is given for how much work is completed." All basic construction funds must be used for special purposes. The working capital with fixed quotas should be used in accordance with the quota, and those without fixed quotas should also be used in accordance with the approved amount. The funds needed for over-quota reserves due to seasonal expansion of production or other legitimate reasons should be solved by short-term loans, and no budget allocations should be increased. For various planned accumulations, it is necessary to supervise and ensure their realization, and urge timely submission of profits, depreciation funds and other funds that should be submitted, and not to occupy them; those that have been occupied should also be cleaned up and paid off within a time limit to ensure fiscal revenue.
    In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen the analysis of basic construction economic activities, and through the analysis of statistical reports, accounting reports, and on-site inspections, supervise the rational use of funds and the completion of basic construction plans on schedule and ahead of schedule. For the existing problems, after verifying the situation and finding out the reasons, we should put forward opinions and urge improvement; for successful experiences, we should summarize them in a timely manner and vigorously promote them.
    Since this year's basic construction plan has changed a lot, and the central government has also stipulated a general reduction in the cost of non-productive buildings, and many designs have been changed, many new problems will inevitably arise. For these new problems, the State Council has issued principled instructions, which should be distinguished from those caused by not paying attention to operation and management and not paying attention to the economical use of funds, and solved realistically. Therefore, the comrades of the People's Construction Bank of China must also strengthen contact with all relevant parties in their work, strengthen investigation and research, and for the problems that occur, they must be realistic, fully negotiate, and adhere to principles as much as possible to reduce losses and wastes, and proceed from reality to prevent hindering the progress of the project.

专栏：厉行全面节约，克服一切浪费

    加强财政监督，充分发挥基本建设投资的效用
    中国人民建设银行行长　马南风
    一九五五年，我国在经济建设和文化建设的预算拨款中，基本建设的支出所占比重最大，拨款数字超过以往任何一年。监督这一巨额资金在完成国家计划的前提下节约地使用，不但是胜利实现一九五五年国家预算的重要关键，并且将保证我国国民经济有计划、按比例地不断增长。因此，加强对基本建设的财政监督，在基本建设中厉行全面节约，克服一切浪费，就成为当前一个十分重要的问题。
    几年来，基本建设工作在各方面都有很大的进步，许多新增固定资产已经投入生产，开始利用，工程成本陆续降低。由于许多建设单位和建筑企业，积极采取措施改善经营管理，一九五五年的基本建设劳动生产率定额虽较过去提高，工业和民用建筑设计预算的定额，则在一九五四年的定额基础上分别降低了百分之二点五和百分之二，还有不少施工单位突破了劳动生产率定额，并超额完成了降低成本计划。
    但在另一方面，基本建设中不重视节约使用资金的现象还很普遍，首先表现为建设预算的编制普遍偏高。中国人民建设银行在今年一至五月份已经审查的建设预算中，不按预算价值计算的占百分之八十七点九八，高估价值平均占原预算总值的百分之八点三九，个别工程的高估现象更突出。例如，石家庄新电厂钢筋混凝土工程，预算中每立方公尺应用钢筋高出定额五倍以上。建设预算的普遍偏高，不仅不合理地加大了国家预算的负担，并且会掩盖施工中的各种浪费，造成建设资金的大量损失。
    由于非生产性建筑的比重过大，建筑标准过高以及盲目追求漂亮装饰等等，也在很大程度上提高了工程造价。据中国人民建设银行北京市分行对四个建设单位的建设预算试点审查的结果，因设计中追求形式而提高的造价占原预算总值的百分之八以上。
    基本建设中不重视节约使用资金的另一个表现，就是不按照规定程序办事，不重视经营管理，积压浪费还很严重。根据中国人民建设银行截至五月底的不完全统计，积压器材价值达三亿五千万元以上，已经查明的各种损失浪费已达三千三百四十三万元。不少工程在计划尚未批准以前就擅自开工，或设计尚未确定以前，就开始进行备料，以致所购器材往往不合实际需要，或者备料过早过多，形成大量积压，而所需的材料又无款购买。有的工程开始筹建过早，造成行政管理费等开支的大量损失和浪费。有的建设单位不问实际需要，盲目进行修建，或修建计划外工程，浪费也很大。个别建设单位，甚至用基本建设资金购买大量不必要的用品。
    基本建设中不重视节约使用资金，还表现在建设单位的内部资源潜力很大，但没有充分动员；建筑企业不注意增加内部积累，并且非法占用预算资金。据对八百三十八个建设单位的统计，今年可以运用的结余资金达二亿四千万元以上。这些结余资金，除一部分是上年为本年的正常储备外，其他大都是历年国家预算所分配的基本建设拨款，因为没有投入工程而被积压了的。有的建设单位可以动员的结余资金竟超过一九五五年的全年投资总额。例如，华东水力发电工程局一○二工程处一九五五年可以运用的结余资金，竟相当于今年全年财务支出数的百分之一百二十三。很多建设单位对于巨额的内部资源，往往不去注意充分动员，一面积压大量资金，一面却造预算伸手向国家要求拨款。许多建设单位财务收支计划所列今年不能运用的结余资金中，也有很多是可以利用的。例如，石景山钢铁厂原列有价值十三万多元的器材今年不能动用，实际上在第一季度即已使用了四万九千多元。还有一些施工单位，对于已经积累起来的利润、折旧基金等等，往往不按期上缴，长期非法占用。
    产生以上问题的原因，固然由于我们对于大规模的经济建设缺乏经验，客观上有一定的困难；中国人民建设银行的拨款监督工作也有不少缺点，对于基本建设中的损失浪费和资金使用上的不合理现象，没有采取有效措施，坚决予以制止。但是，更重要的是因为在许多基本建设部门中，缺乏明确的经济观点。有人认为，“只要钱多就好办事”，对于建设预算的编制，总要求计算得宽些，以为“剩下来反正是国家的”。他们往往强调没有经验，原谅自己。有的怕赔钱，怕完不成任务。或者认为预算大些，用起来可以“方便”些，免得以后请求追加；甚至希望从中“捞一把”，充实本部门的活动费。在这些错误思想的支配下，就使得国家预算对于这些建设单位必须拨给超过实际需要的资金，让他们去弥补浪费，避免赔钱，用得“方便”。这样就使国家不得不付出推迟或削减许多必要工程的代价。
    很多建设单位非生产性建筑的单位造价超过标准，修建的面积也超过实际需要。这种脱离目前经济水平和人民生活水平的做法，就是基本建设中缺乏明确的经济观点的另一种具体表现。生活水平的提高必须建立在生产发展的基础上，假如非生产性建筑的标准，脱离了生产发展的基础，超过了劳动生产率提高的速度，那末，还有多少资金可以用来修建工厂、矿山呢？非生产性建筑当然也应该注意质量，但绝不能脱离目前的客观条件。
    基本建设中另一种非经济观点，就是认为：只要完成任务，就是最大的节约，损失浪费一点不要紧。并且往往借口重点工程的特殊性，为自己所造成的损失浪费辩护。这些同志忘记了除了完成工程任务以外，我们还有一项重要的任务，就是要在一切部门中厉行全面节约，坚决克服一切浪费，为国家积累更多的建设资金。
    基本建设中的非经济观点，也表现在许多建设单位对待结余资金的态度上。有些人认为：“结余资金多，器材大量积压，是因为计划变更和客观上的其他原因造成的。要我们完成任务，只有另外拨款。”又有一些人，当流动资金周转一时稍有困难，便到处叫嚷资金不够，要求增加拨款。但他们没有想到，国家预算的资金，都有一定的用途，不能听任长期积压。事实上，已经有许多建设单位和建筑企业，由于注意了内部资源的充分动员，采取措施积极处理积压，不但减少了预算支出，有的并且还上缴了多余资金。
    十分明显，这些非经济观点，是同社会主义工业化的道路完全相违背的。克服这种非经济观点的办法，就是坚决贯彻中共中央和国务院的号召，根据“适用、经济、可能条件下的美观”的原则来进行设计，精确地编制建设预算；彻底查清可以运用的内部资源，充分把它利用，并采取有效的措施，积极改善经营管理，消灭一切损失浪费，不断地降低工程成本。中国人民建设银行的同志们要进一步明确认识到我们所负的责任重大，克服一切不敢对基本建设投资进行监督的消极思想，加强对基本建设的财政监督。
    中国人民建设银行首先要大力审查建设预算，制止一切损失浪费，监督降低工程成本。对于建设预算，不仅要按定额剔除高估的价格，而且要特别注意非生产性建筑的造价是否超过规定标准。对于设计中铺张、浪费以及不必要的建筑、设备、购置等等，应该积极提出意见，监督改进。同时，还要监督施工单位在审查后的预算基础上，按照规定指标，编制切实可行的降低工程成本计划，并采取具体措施，保证计划的实现。对于基本建设中的一切损失浪费，必须展开坚决的斗争；不仅要有效地予以制止，而且要采用各种方式，大力揭发，造成强大的社会舆论，以利监督纠正。
    其次，必须监督建设单位在基本建设中大力挖掘潜在力量，充分利用内部资源，以加速资金周转，减少财政支出。对于建设单位的结余资金，不仅要督促他们彻底查清实际的结存情况，并且要监督建设单位将本年可以运用的结余资金，列入财务收支计划，抵充今年的预算拨款。结余资金中今年工程可用的器材，应该尽量设法利用；今年工程不能使用的，应该变价出售；别人欠我的债款必须定期收回，我欠别人的债务也应及时清偿。对于积压的器材，必须监督建设单位和建筑企业进行调剂处理，并大力防止新的积压的产生。同时，要监督施工单位积极改善劳动组织，提高劳动生产率，充分使用机械设备，不断挖掘潜在力量，增加基本建设的内部积累。
    再次，为了监督基本建设资金的节约使用，还必须严格执行计划纪律，预算纪律和财政纪律。一切基本建设工作，必须按照批准的计划和设计进行，对于未经列入计划和不按设计施工的工程，不得拨付款项。有些工程在计划和设计尚未批准以前，如果急需开工，也必须按照规定，经过一定的批准手续。基本建设的各项费用支出，必须符合计划和预算的规定，绝对不能容许有超预算拨款的现象发生。同时，还必须加强结算工作，特别对工程价款更须按照制度规定，根据“完成多少工程给多少钱”的原则，认真执行结算。对各项基本建设资金，必须专款专用。有定额规定的流动资金应该按照定额运用，没有定额规定的也应该按照核定的额度运用。由于生产的季节性扩大的或其他正当原因而产生的超定额储备的资金需要，应该用短期放款解决，不得增加预算拨款。对于各项计划积累，要监督保证实现，并督促及时上缴利润，折旧基金和其它应该上缴的资金，不得占用；已经占用的，也要限期清理缴清，以保证财政收入。
    此外，还要加强对基本建设经济活动的分析，通过对统计报表、会计报表的分析和现场检查，监督资金的合理运用和基本建设计划的按期和先期完成。对于存在的问题，应该在证实情况，查明原因以后，提出意见，督促改进；对于成功的经验，应该及时总结，大力推广。
    由于今年基本建设的计划变动较多，中央又规定普遍削减非生产性建筑造价，许多设计都有变更，就必然会产生不少新的问题。对于这些新的问题，国务院已有原则指示，应该同那些由于不重视经营管理、不重视节约使用资金而造成的问题有所区别，实事求是地予以解决。因此，中国人民建设银行的同志们在进行工作中，还必须加强同各有关方面的联系。加强调查研究，对于发生的问题，必须实事求是，充分协商，既要坚持原则，尽可能地减少损失浪费，又要从实际出发，防止妨碍工程的进行。
