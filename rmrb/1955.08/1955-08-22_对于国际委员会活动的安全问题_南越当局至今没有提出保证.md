　　Regarding Security Concerns for the International Commission's Activities
　　The South Vietnamese Authorities Have Yet to Offer Guarantees
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 20th: According to a Vietnam News Agency dispatch on the 19th, the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam is planning to establish its headquarters in Saigon before the end of August. However, the South Vietnamese authorities have not yet formally offered guarantees for the security of the Commission's activities.
    Note: After a group of thugs, with the tacit approval of the South Vietnamese government, attacked personnel of the International Commission stationed in Saigon on July 20th, the Chairman of the International Commission, Desai, met with Ngo Dinh Diem the next day, requesting him to respond to several questions regarding respect for the International Commission and the establishment of the Commission's headquarters in Saigon. However, the South Vietnamese authorities have consistently failed to express a clear attitude in this regard.

　　对于国际委员会活动的安全问题
　  南越当局至今没有提出保证
    新华社河内二十日电　据越南通讯社十九日讯：越南国际监督和监察委员会正计划在八月底以前在西贡设立总部。但是，南越当局至今还没有正式对委员会活动的安全提出保证。
    按：在七月二十日一批暴徒在南越政府默许下攻击驻西贡的国际委员会人员以后，国际委员会主席德赛第二天就会见吴庭艳，要求他答复若干关于尊重国际委员会和委员会在西贡设立总部的问题。然而，南越当局在这方面一直没有表示明确的态度。
