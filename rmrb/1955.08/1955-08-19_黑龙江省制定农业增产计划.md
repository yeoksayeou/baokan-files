    Heilongjiang Province is formulating an agricultural increase plan.

    By the end of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, the total grain output of Heilongjiang Province will increase from 6.7 million tons in 1954 to 9 million tons.

    Heilongjiang Province is one of China's major coarse grain production areas, with commodity grain accounting for more than half of its total grain output. The soybeans produced here are famous in the international market. It also produces a certain amount of wheat, rice, as well as sugar beets and flax. However, in the past, most fields in Heilongjiang Province had low yields per unit area due to rough cultivation. At the same time, more wasteland has not been developed. It is estimated that the total area of wasteland in the province is about 10 million hectares, most of which can be reclaimed as arable land. The rapid development of the agricultural cooperativization movement in the province provides an organizational guarantee for the full and rational utilization of the above-mentioned resources. The agricultural production plan for Heilongjiang Province's first five-year plan is formulated based on these circumstances.

    In order to ensure the realization of this increase plan, Heilongjiang Province will reclaim a large amount of wasteland and expand the cultivated land area during the first five-year plan. In addition to mobilizing the masses to carry out small-scale reclamation, it will also organize specialized mechanized reclamation teams and state-owned mechanized farms to carry out large-scale reclamation with machines. The province will also complete the surveying of 3 million hectares of wasteland by 1957. In addition, farmers will be mobilized to build small-scale water conservancy projects, expand paddy fields by 100,000 hectares in the next three years, and take measures to improve cultivation techniques to increase yields per unit area. It is required that the yield per hectare in 1957 reach 1,497 kilograms, an increase of 26.7 percent over 1954. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

### 黑龙江省制定农业增产计划

    黑龙江省制定农业增产计划
    黑龙江省在发展国民经济的第一个五年计划终了时，全省的粮食总产量将由一九五四年的六百七十万吨增加到九百万吨。
    黑龙江省是中国杂粮主要产区之一，商品粮占粮食总产量一半以上。这里盛产的大豆，驰名国际市场。还出产一定数量的小麦、水稻以及甜菜和亚麻等。但是，黑龙江省过去大多数田地因耕作粗糙，单位面积产量不高。同时有更多的荒地没有被开发，据估计全省荒地总面积约有一千万公顷左右，其中大部分可以开垦为耕地。全省农业合作化运动的迅速发展，为充分、合理地利用上述资源提供了组织保证。黑龙江省第一个五年计划的农业生产计划，就是根据这些情况制定的。
    为了保证实现这一增产计划，在第一个五年计划内，黑龙江省要大量开垦荒地，扩大耕地面积。除发动群众进行小型开荒外，还组织专门开荒的机耕开荒队和国营机械农场用机器大片开荒。全省到一九五七年还要完成三百万公顷荒地的勘测任务。此外，要发动农民兴修小型水利，在今后三年内扩大水田十万公顷，并将采取改进耕作技术等措施来提高单位面积产量。要求一九五七年每公顷的单位面积产量，达到一千四百九十七公斤，比一九五四年提高百分之二十六点七。（据新华社讯）
