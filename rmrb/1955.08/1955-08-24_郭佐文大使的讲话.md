Esteemed Premier, Comrades, and Friends:

　　Please allow me, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of Romania, to express our heartfelt gratitude to you for attending tonight's reception, which is held to celebrate the eleventh anniversary of the glorious Soviet army liberating Romania and the patriotic forces of the people, under the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party, overthrowing the fascist dictatorship.

　　August 23, 1944, marks the beginning of a fundamental transformation in the history and life of our people; that is, the transformation from the past reactionary regime that cruelly exploited the working masses and from the state of political and economic enslavement of Romania by imperialist countries to the people's democratic regime of today; under this regime, the working people, who have become masters of a free and independent country, are enthusiastically building the foundations of socialism. Thanks to the enthusiasm shown by the working people in their labor, the comprehensive assistance of the Soviet Union, and the cooperation of other people's democratic countries, yesterday's Romania—which was once called a rich country with poor people, and also called a country that only served as an agricultural appendage—has transformed in the eleven years since liberation into a fully developing industrial and agricultural country. The living and cultural standards of the people have been significantly improved and continue to improve constantly.

　　The Romanian people, who have become builders of a new life, are deeply concerned about maintaining and consolidating peace and the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems. They welcome with satisfaction the positive achievements recently made in easing international tensions.

　　The Romanian people have always advocated the development of economic and cultural relations between all countries, the reduction of armaments, the establishment of collective security systems in Europe and Asia, and the settlement of outstanding international issues through negotiation; they are determined to make their full contribution to the victory of easing international tensions and to the friendship and cooperation between all peoples in the future as well.

　　The Romanian people are excited and proud of the achievements made by the Chinese people on the road to building socialism and defending peace, and wholeheartedly congratulate them on their new achievements in transforming China into a great socialist country, in achieving territorial integrity, and in defending peace in the Far East and the world.

　　The relations between the People's Republic of Romania and the People's Republic of China are developing and becoming closer day by day; this development and closer relationship is beneficial to the peoples of both countries. It is a shining example of a new type of international relations promoted by the Soviet Union and based on the sincere desire for friendly cooperation and mutual assistance.

　　Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Romanian people and the great Chinese people!

　　The Romanian people extend warm fraternal greetings to the Chinese people and their leaders, long live the Chinese people and their leaders!

　　Long live the liberator of the Romanian people, the reliable fortress of world peace—the Soviet Union!

　　Long live peace and cooperation between all peoples!

　　郭佐文大使的讲话敬爱的总理同志、同志们和朋友们：
    请容许我代表罗马尼亚人民共和国政府对你们的出席今天的招待晚会表示衷心的谢意；这个晚会的举行是为了庆祝光荣的苏联军队解放罗马尼亚和在罗马尼亚共产党领导下的人民爱国力量推翻法西斯专政十一周年。
    一九四四年八月二十三日这个日子是我国人民的历史和生活中的一个根本转变的开端；就是说，从残酷地剥削劳动群众的过去反动政权和从帝国主义国家对罗马尼亚进行政治经济奴役的状态转变成为今天的人民民主政权；在这个政权下，成为自由和独立国家的主人的劳动人民正在热烈地建设着社会主义的基础。由于劳动人民在劳动中所表现出来的热情，由于苏联的全面的帮助，由于其他人民民主国家的合作，昨天的罗马尼亚——它曾经被称为拥有贫穷人民的富裕国家，同时也被称为只起农业附庸作用的国家——在解放以来的十一年中已经变成为正在充分发展着的工业农业国。人民的生活和文化水平已经得到了显著的提高，并且在继续不断地提高。
    成为新生活的建设者的罗马尼亚人民深切地关心和平的维护和巩固以及具有不同社会制度的国家之间的和平共处，他们怀着满意的心情欢迎最近在缓和国际紧张局势方面所获得的积极成就。
    罗马尼亚人民一向主张发展所有国家之间的经济和文化关系，主张裁减军备，主张在欧洲和亚洲建立集体安全体系，主张通过协商的途径来解决悬而未决的国际问题；他们今后也决心要为缓和国际紧张局势的胜利以及为各国人民之间的友好和合作作出她全部的贡献。
    罗马尼亚人民为中国人民在建设社会主义和保卫和平的道路上所取得的成就而感到兴奋和骄傲，并且衷心地祝贺他们在把中国改变成为一个伟大社会主义国家的事业中，在为取得领土完整以及在保卫远东和世界和平中获得新的成就。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国和中华人民共和国之间的关系正在日益发展和更加密切；这种关系的日益发展和更加密切对两国人民都是有益处的。它是由苏联提倡的并基于友好合作和互相帮助的诚恳愿望的新型国际关系的光辉范例。
    罗马尼亚人民和伟大中国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    罗马尼亚人民向中国人民及其领袖致以热烈的兄弟般敬意，中国人民及其领袖万岁！
    罗马尼亚人民的解放者，全世界和平的可靠堡垒——苏联万岁！
    各国人民之间的和平与合作万岁！
