Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 22nd: Tirana Dispatch: The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Albania, Mr. Shtylla, recently sent a telegram to the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Hammarskjöld.

In the telegram, Mr. Shtylla said: The Albanian government has received the Greek government's response, transmitted by the UN Secretary-General, to the Albanian government's proposal to establish diplomatic and good-neighborly relations with Greece. The Albanian government expresses its regret that the Greek government did not indicate in its response its willingness to establish diplomatic and good-neighborly relations between the two countries at this time.

The telegram also said: The Albanian government believes that the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between Albania and Greece would be an important step on the road to normalizing relations and easing tensions in the Balkans, which is fully in line with the fundamental interests of the Albanian and Greek peoples and the positive atmosphere in international relations that has emerged since the Geneva Four-Power Summit. Therefore, the Government of the People's Republic of Albania hopes that the Greek government will carefully re-examine the proposal of the Government of the People's Republic of Albania on the establishment of normal relations between Albania and Greece, which will prove the Greek government's sincerity in consolidating peace in the Balkans, for which it is necessary to eliminate the factors hindering the normalization of relations between Albania and Greece.

　　就阿尔巴尼亚和希腊两国建立正常外交关系问题
　  阿尔巴尼亚外长再次致电联合国秘书长
    新华社布拉格二十二日电　地拉那消息：阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国外交部长什图拉日前给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德发去了一个电报。
    什图拉在电报中说：由联合国秘书长转来的希腊政府对阿尔巴尼亚政府关于同希腊建立外交和睦邻关系的建议的答复已经收到。阿尔巴尼亚政府对希腊政府并没有在答复中表明愿意在目前建立两国间的外交和睦邻关系，表示遗憾。
    这个电报还说：阿尔巴尼亚政府认为，阿尔巴尼亚同希腊建立正常外交关系将是使关系正常化和缓和巴尔干地区的紧张局势的道路上的重要步骤，这完全符合阿希两国人民的切身利益以及在日内瓦四大国政府首脑会议以后国际关系中呈现的良好气氛。因此，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府希望希腊政府再次仔细研究阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府关于阿希两国建立正常关系的建议，这样将会证明希腊政府巩固巴尔干的和平的诚意，为了巴尔干的和平就有必要消除妨碍阿希两国关系正常化的因素。
