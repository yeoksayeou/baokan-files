Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 15th: Vice Marshal Choe Yong-gon, Minister of National Defense of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued an order on the 15th to all officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army land, sea, and air forces, celebrating the 10th anniversary of Korea's liberation on "August 15th."

　　In the order, Vice Marshal Choe Yong-gon said: "The historical facts of the past ten years since liberation prove that the struggle of the people in the northern half, who hold sovereignty in their own hands, for freedom, happiness, and the prosperous development of the motherland is justified, and only this struggle can guarantee the complete unification and independence of our country."

　　The order pointed out: Due to the obstruction of US imperialism and its running dog, the Syngman Rhee gang, Korea is still in a state of division. They are brutally violating the armistice agreement, attempting to launch a new war.

　　The order called on all officers and soldiers of the People's Army to maintain a state of mobilization, ready at any time to resolutely repel any aggression by the enemy. The order also called on the People's Army officers and soldiers to further strengthen their combat friendship and unity with the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

　　In order to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the liberation of Korea, Vice Marshal Choe Yong-gon ordered that at 21:00 on August 15th, a salute will be fired in the democratic capital, Pyongyang, to celebrate.

    新华社平壤十五日电  朝鲜民主主义人民共和国民族保卫相崔庸健次帅在十五日向朝鲜人民军陆、海、空军全体将士发布命令，庆祝“八一五”朝鲜解放十周年。
    崔庸健次帅在命令中说：“解放后十年来的历史事实证明：把主权掌握在自己手中的北半部人民，为自由、幸福和祖国的富强发展而进行的斗争是正当的，只有这个斗争才能保障我国的完全统一和独立。”

    命令号召全体人民军将士要坚持动员的姿态，随时准备对敌人的任何侵犯给予坚决的回击。命令还号召人民军将士进一步加强同中国人民志愿军指挥员和战斗员的战斗友谊和团结。
    为了纪念朝鲜解放十周年，崔庸健次帅命令：八月十五日二十一时，在民主首都平壤鸣放礼炮，以示庆祝。
