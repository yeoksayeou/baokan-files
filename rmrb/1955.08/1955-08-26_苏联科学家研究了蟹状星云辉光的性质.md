Xinhua News Agency, August 25th - According to a TASS report: Scientists at the Sternberg Astronomical Institute of Moscow University have studied the properties of the glow of the so-called Crab Nebula.

The head of the Radio Astronomy Department of the Institute, Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Shklovsky, told a TASS reporter: The Crab Nebula is a remnant of a tremendous cosmic cataclysm that occurred nine hundred years ago. According to irrefutable evidence from Chinese and Japanese historical records, in July 1054, a star exploded in the sky, emitting a glow brighter than Venus. This star was visible to the naked eye during the day. After a few months, the star's light gradually dimmed. Now, the Crab Nebula is seen in the place where that star once was. The name comes from its shape resembling a crab. It is now determined that what Chinese and Japanese astronomers saw at that time was the explosion of a "supernova." This very rare phenomenon (occurring once every three to four hundred years) is one of the most spectacular natural phenomena.

For some reason that is not yet understood, a massive explosion occurs inside some stars, and their surfaces begin to expand at incredible speeds. In this case, the size of the star sometimes exceeds the solar system. The radiation flow emitted by this greatly expanded surface exceeds the radiation flow of the star before the explosion by hundreds of millions of times. As a result of this explosion, gaseous layers separate from the expanded star, and these are the nebulae that are later observed. The Crab Nebula is such a nebula.

Shklovsky pointed out that scientists believe the Crab Nebula is a powerful source of radio waves. However, in the past, scientists always believed that the glow of the Crab Nebula had a continuous spectrum, determined by the thermal radiation of the gas that makes up the nebula. Now, observations and studies by Soviet scientists have proven that the nature of the light radiation of the Crab Nebula with a continuous spectrum is the same as the nature of radio waves, and this light radiation can be said to be a continuation of radio waves. Both radio waves and most of the light radiation are due to the presence of an extremely large number of electron streams in the nebula, and this radiation is constantly polarized.

Shklovsky said that the fundamental change in understanding the nature of the Crab Nebula's glow is of great significance to astronomy and physics. For example, it was previously thought that the mass of the Crab Nebula exceeded the mass of the sun; according to the new view, its mass does not exceed one-tenth of the mass of the sun. This means that the explosion of a "supernova" does not mean its complete destruction. Shklovsky concluded by saying that it must be pointed out that the explosion of a "supernova" is very likely the origin of cosmic rays.

### 苏联科学家研究了蟹状星云辉光的性质

　　苏联科学家研究了蟹状星云辉光的性质
    新华社二十五日讯　据塔斯社报道：莫斯科大学斯特恩堡天文学研究所研究了关于所谓蟹状星云的辉光的性质。
    这个研究所的无线电天文学部主任、物理数学博士希克洛夫斯基对塔斯社记者说：蟹状星云是在九百年前发生的一次巨大的宇宙剧变的遗迹。根据中国和日本的历史记载的无可置辩的证据，在一零五四年七月，天空中有一颗星爆发，发出比金星还亮的辉光。白天里用肉眼就可以看见这颗星。过了几个月之后，这颗星的光逐渐黯淡下去。而现在就在这颗星的地方看到了蟹状星云。这个名称是由于它的形状像蟹而起的。现在断定，当时中国和日本的天文学家看到的是“超新”星的爆发。这一非常少见的现象（三、四百年发生一次）是最奇观的自然现象之一。
    由于某种还不明白的原因，在有些星的内部发生了巨大的爆发，它们的表面开始以无比的速度扩张。在这种情况下，星的体积有时超过了太阳系。这种大大膨胀了的表面发出的辐射流要超过在爆发以前的星的辐射流好几亿倍。由于这种爆发，从膨胀了的星中就分离出气体表层，这就是后来观察到的星云。蟹状星云就是这样的星云。
    希克洛夫斯基指出，科学家认为蟹状星云是射电的强力的来源。但是过去科学家一直认为蟹状星云的辉光中有连续光谱，是由组成星云的气体的热辐射所决定的。现在，苏联科学家的观察和研究证明，带连续光谱的蟹状星云的光辐射的性质同射电的性质是一样的，这种光辐射可以说是射电的继续。无论是射电或是大部分光辐射，都是由于星云中存在有极其大量的电子流，而且这种辐射还在不断极化。
    希克洛夫斯基说，关于蟹状星云辉光的性质的见解的根本改变，对天文学和物理学都有很大的意义。例如，以前认为，蟹状星云的质量超过太阳的质量；根据新的见解，它的质量不超过太阳质量的十分之一。这就是说，“超新”星的爆发并不意味着它的完全毁灭。希克洛夫斯基最后说，必须指出，“超新”星的爆发很可能是宇宙线的起源。
