    李川江车间将再增产食油
    全国人民代表大会代表李川江所在的吉林省四平油酒制造厂制油车间的工人，最近修订了全年增产食油的计划，提出要比原订增产计划再增产三万三千五百斤食油。
    四平油酒制造厂制油车间主任李川江，八月初向车间工人们传达了第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议的成就。车间工人很振奋，一致表示要增产更多的食油来实现国家的第一个五年计划。接着，李川江就同工人们一起讨论增产食油的措施，学习和运用了能多出油的先进经验，还改进了设备。这样，八月上旬的出油率就提高到百分之十四点一七。八月十六日，他们经过讨论，把全年增产食油的计划修订为七万八千三百斤，比原来的全年增产四万四千八百斤的计划提高了百分之七十五；全年出油率平均要达到百分之十四点零三，比国家指标提高百分之零点一八。（据新华社讯）
