　　Stop the Heinous Practice of Attempting to Arrange Child Marriage in Disguise

To the Editor:

　　I am a fourteen-year-old girl, a graduate of the First Complete Primary School in the First District of Baicheng County, Jilin Province. I have encountered something inexplicable that keeps me from focusing on my studies.

　　Before the end of this semester, our primary school principal, Wang Lan, suddenly proposed to introduce me as his younger brother's fiancée. Imagine, I am only fourteen years old, how could I talk about such things? So I refused. But he kept bothering me. In addition to the principal himself talking to me, his mother, wife, and younger sister also came to find me. They would find me at school, and sometimes come to my house to talk, talking until late at night. They first asked if my family had financial difficulties, whether I would continue my education after graduating from primary school...; then they said that the principal's brother worked in the army and earned a lot of money, and if I agreed to be his fiancée, he could provide for my schooling and subsidize my family's living expenses... I had already made my attitude clear, but they still wanted to talk, as if seeing that I was young, a few more words would make me agree. This has caused me a lot of distress. I couldn't study properly before the final exam, and now I can't concentrate on reviewing for the middle school entrance exam. In addition, because the principal and his family were gossiping among my neighbors and teachers at school, many people knew about this, and some made fun of me, which made me very embarrassed. I have no father, only a mother, and she has become ill with worry because of this.

　　Editor: I absolutely cannot agree to this absurd request from our principal. But what should I do? I am young and have no idea. Please write to me quickly.　Li Fenglan

　　Editor's Note: After we entrusted the Baicheng County Culture and Education Section to investigate, Li Fenglan's statement is true; currently, Wang Lan still believes that his approach "is nothing, agree if you agree, forget about it if you don't." We believe that Wang Lan's attempt to arrange child marriage in disguise through harassment is a violation of the Marriage Law. The Baicheng County Culture and Education Section should immediately stop Wang Lan's heinous practice and give him the punishment he deserves.

### 制止企图变相包办幼女婚姻的恶劣做法

　　制止企图变相包办幼女婚姻的恶劣做法编辑同志：
    我是一个十四岁的女孩子，是吉林省白城县第一区第一完全小学这一届的毕业生。我碰上了一件莫名其妙的事情，使我整天安不下心来学习。
    在这学期结束以前，我们小学的校长王岚突然提出要介绍我做他弟弟的未婚妻。你想，我才十四岁，那能谈这种事呢？因此我就拒绝了。可是他还是缠住我不放。除了校长本人同我谈话以外，他的母亲、爱人和妹妹也来找我。他们在学校里遇上我就找我，有时还到我家里去谈，一谈谈到深夜。他们先是问我家生活困难不困难，我小学毕业后升学不升学……；接着就说校长的弟弟在部队里工作，工资很多，如果我同意做他的未婚妻，他可以供给我念书，还可以补贴我家一部分生活费用……。我早就表明了我的态度，他们还是要谈，似乎看我年纪小，多说上三言五语就可以答应了。这样，我被闹得很苦恼，期考前不能好好温课，现在准备考中学也安不下心来复习。另外，由于校长和他家里的人在我家的邻居和学校的老师中东说西说，很多人都知道了这件事，有的就拿我开玩笑，使我很难堪。我没有父亲了，只有一个母亲，她为了这件事也苦恼得生了病。
    编辑同志：我根本不能答应我们校长这个岂有此理的要求。但应该怎么办呢？我年纪小，没个主意，请你们赶快写信告诉我。　李凤兰
      编者按：经我们委托白城县文教科调查，李凤兰所说的情况是真实的；目前王岚还认为他这种做法“没啥，同意就算，不同意就拉倒”。我们认为，王岚这样用纠缠办法企图变相地包办幼女婚姻，是违反婚姻法的行为。白城县文教科应该立即制止王岚的这种恶劣做法，并给以应得的处分。
