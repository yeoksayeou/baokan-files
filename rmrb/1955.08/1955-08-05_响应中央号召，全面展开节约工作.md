    Responding to the Central Call, Comprehensively Launching Conservation Work
    Chen Yu
    According to the spirit of the Party Central Committee and the State Council's various instructions on practicing thrift and economy, and reviewing the work of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the phenomenon of waste in the fuel industry system, whether in capital construction or production, is very serious.
    In terms of non-productive construction, the phenomena of building too much, seeking perfection, and "welfare before production" are common. The Chongqing 507 Power Plant built a large auditorium that could accommodate more than twice the number of current employees. Their reason was that workers could bring their families to evening events and plays. Why must we build theaters for families? The Beijing Cultural and Educational Zone substation provided 252 square meters of dormitory space for eight people, averaging more than 30 square meters per person, which is undeniably excessive! Moreover, since 1953, the cost of residential construction has increased year by year. The average cost of residential construction in the Ministry of Fuel Industry reached 78 yuan per square meter, with some reaching over 100 yuan. The cost of dormitories in the Xinjiang Petroleum Company reached over 500 yuan per square meter. Some units also demanded too much and too good for their offices and school buildings. The office building of the Mining Institute, with a construction cost of 140 yuan per square meter, resembled a large classroom but was used by only a few people, and a "Five Phoenix Building" was built for aesthetic purposes. The planned office building for the Jilin Power Plant was 213 yuan per square meter. Most notably, the toilet at the Longchang Carbon Black Plant was approved by the Petroleum Administration at 6 yuan per square meter, but it was actually built for 110 yuan, which is an extreme act of disorganization and indiscipline. Coal mines, regardless of the size of the mine, whether newly built or renovated, all have a combined administrative and welfare building; all mining bureaus in the Northeast have sanatoriums without exception, and the general standards are too high.
    Waste in productive construction is also serious, mainly manifested in preferring large over small, favoring new over old, and blindly pursuing excessively high standards. Many relocation, restoration, and renovation projects often involve large-scale demolition and replacement, causing unnecessary losses. When Kunming relocated a set of 2,250 kW generating equipment, two-thirds of the original equipment was replaced; this not only wasted money but also inevitably delayed construction time. The relocation of the 15,000 kW generator in Wuchang, due to the requirement to add many unnecessary new equipment, had a design budget as high as 13 million yuan. The review resulted in only 4 million yuan being needed, which could also advance the construction time by half a year compared to the original design. Although the Datong Meiyukou mine is called a renovation, in reality, everything except the shaft is essentially new, resulting in an investment of 18 million yuan, and the production time was delayed by five years due to several design changes.
    The same is true for new construction projects. The 6,000 kW generator installed in the Huainan Coal Mine is a Czech-type equipment manufactured domestically. When designing, we not only completely adopted the Soviet-designed 6,000 kW design but also added many unnecessary equipment, resulting in an increased investment of 2 million yuan. The Fengfeng Coal Mine built an expensive large stone bridge for transporting coal, which the masses called the "Millennium Bridge." Many small and medium-sized mines designed domestically and some renovated mines require a high degree of mechanization and a large safety factor in technical conditions, which is also an important reason for high construction costs and significant waste.
    In recent years, although capital construction has basically completed its tasks and the quality of the projects has been generally guaranteed, there is still a lot of rework and waste. For example, a high-grade lubricating oil workshop, due to lax inspection during construction and poor project quality, was put into production five and a half months later than originally planned, not only failing to meet the original planned output but also wasting 15% of the investment. For example, the Dongshan, Caitun, and Central vertical shafts in coal mines all had poor quality. After the Caitun vertical shaft was handed over to production, the additional investment was large due to poor project quality, resulting in waste.
    The stockpiling and waste of raw materials and equipment are also very serious in production and capital construction. Such examples are too numerous to mention.
    The waste in production in the Ministry of Fuel Industry system is also alarming.
    Everyone knows that petroleum is the most scarce material in our country during the transition period, but some people do not cherish it. Fushun and Jinxi have "oil rivers," and Yumen even has "oil lakes." Our leading comrades and employees are turning a blind eye to these "rivers" and "lakes." From the fourth quarter of 1954 to the first quarter of 1955, the Petroleum Second Factory recovered 2,000 tons of petroleum flowing from the oil inspection pool by itself. The Yumen "oil lake" is a sideline resource for the nearby masses every winter. In 1955, the Yumen Oil Mine even planned to use 2,000 tons of crude oil to mix with asphalt to sprinkle on roads to suppress dust. Is such waste of the country's most scarce resource tolerable?
    In coal mines and the electricity industry, the waste situation is similar. The Datong Coal Mine inventoried four working faces on May 7 and found 2,204 new pit props discarded. The North China Electricity Administration found forty transformers and switches in 1954 that had been left outdoors for a long time, exposed to the sun and rain, and sunk in the mud, some of which were unusable. Twenty-nine coal mines overspent 64,000 cubic meters of wood, worth 3.8 million yuan, and 960 tons of explosives, worth 1.9 million yuan, from January to November 1954.
    Due to the lack of a conservation viewpoint and the mindset of being generous with resources, the waste in administrative management, labor utilization, and capital and material turnover is also significant. In 1955, the administrative expenses of the capital construction of the Ministry of Fuel Industry could be greatly saved. According to calculations from the petroleum exploration system, 21.5% can be reduced from the original plan. In the production system, the central government stipulates that office expenses per person should not exceed 5 to 10 yuan, but in the past, except for individual units, it was 15 to 31 yuan per person. The Chongqing 507 Power Plant spent 52,000 yuan on the groundbreaking ceremony. In order to pay attention to pomp, it bought all Chinese and Western tableware and made 300 sets of khaki work clothes, all of which were remade because the colors were slightly inconsistent. An electric power plant in Heilongjiang Province even planned to make woolen work clothes, and the inkwells in the office had to be made of marble.
    Due to the backwardness of labor organization and management, the large and bloated enterprise management structure, the waste of labor, and the excessive number of non-production personnel are also common phenomena. The Shizitan Hydropower Station construction site currently has 13,000 people. According to the inspection by the Ministry and the General Administration, at least 2,000 people can be reduced. In the past, due to the large number of people, even during the busy construction season, 400 to 500 people, sometimes even 1,000 people, were idle every day. In terms of work efficiency, earthwork engineering was 42.4% lower than the national quota, and rock and earthwork engineering was 30.5% lower than the national quota. This situation is common. In addition to idling and low efficiency, the utilization rate of working hours is also low, generally below seven hours at construction sites. The situation in production is no exception. According to statistics from the coal mine system, it is generally only about five and a half hours. The number of administrative management personnel and non-production personnel has also increased significantly in recent years. In the Ministry of Fuel Industry's production system, management personnel accounted for 7.5% of all employees in 1950, 8.1% in 1951, 9% in 1952, 9.5% in 1953, and 9.6% in 1954. According to the approved draft staffing plan, the production system alone can reduce 10,000 to 13,000 people. If calculated at an average monthly salary of 60 yuan per person, the annual savings in wages would be 7.2 million to 9.36 million yuan. If the costs of welfare construction management are added, the figure would be even larger.
    Failure to pay attention to capital turnover has also resulted in a large backlog of working capital. In 1954, due to our failure to complete the capital turnover plan, we accumulated 51.39 million yuan of national funds. If we add the stagnant materials and excessive storage materials of 82.98 million yuan, there would be 134.37 million yuan.
    Safe power supply in production is also not done well. From January to May 1955, 2.2 million kWh of electricity were undersupplied to users, reducing industrial output value by 6.6 million yuan. The quality of coal is also not good. According to national standards, we receive more penalties than rewards. This year, due to the failure to meet the standards, we were fined 200,000 yuan. This fully shows that we do not pay enough attention to product quality.
    What are the reasons for the serious waste?
    First, because we have not profoundly recognized the long-term and arduous nature of socialist construction, and the serious significance of hard struggle for socialist construction, many of our comrades do not understand the difficulty of our funding sources. We often fail to concentrate the use of funds on major industrial construction. On the contrary, we equate non-productive construction with productive construction. We often do non-productive construction first, while the truly important things related to direct production are not done well.
    Second, due to our low policy and ideological level, we do not deeply understand the central government's repeated instructions on conservation, our leadership thinking on conservation work is not clear enough, and we do not sufficiently recognize the need to determine reasonable construction standards based on China's current actual situation and to consider issues based on the principle of the worker-peasant alliance. In recent years, we have not established a strict conservation system, and the existing system has not been earnestly implemented. We lack a strict financial supervision system, especially a lack of in-depth inspection work, and we have not resolutely carried out a ruthless and effective struggle against waste.
    Third, we lack an economic viewpoint, and we do not pay attention to using limited financial and material resources most rationally and effectively to serve economic construction. We have not implemented careful planning and budgeting in all aspects of production and capital construction, and we have the mindset of only caring about construction regardless of the cost. Many comrades rarely pay attention to studying cost management and the use of resources, and they turn a blind eye to serious waste and loss of resources. Therefore, it is natural that they cannot elevate the strict economic accounting system to a higher political principle.
    Fourth, we have a serious subjective and idealistic way of thinking that is divorced from reality. Therefore, we blindly pursue new standards, carry out construction without considering our country's current economic and production levels, and do not consider fully utilizing existing equipment and domestic manufacturing capabilities.
    Fifth, we still have varying degrees of localism and hedonistic thinking. For example, we "cut wide and use narrow," using key projects as an excuse to often increase budgets and raise standards; the quotas in general projects are not advanced, the standards are not strict, and a large amount of capital accumulation and loss is invisibly created; in daily life and non-productive expenses, we pay attention to pomp, grandeur, and beauty, spending a fortune without batting an eye. These are, in essence, a kind of bourgeois hedonistic thinking.
    In order to increase production and practice thrift and economy, first, our leading staff and all employees are required to clearly recognize the great significance of conservation ideologically, fundamentally reverse the various incorrect ideas that currently exist, and earnestly establish a good atmosphere of practicing thrift and economy, hard work, and struggle. We must strengthen the idea of strict economic accounting and establish a strict conservation system.
    In the future, all non-productive buildings, except for those that are absolutely necessary, will not be built. Those that are absolutely necessary should be strictly reviewed and approved by the Ministry and the General Administration, and the lowest standards should be adopted. Existing production plants and mines will generally increase production without increasing personnel. If personnel must be increased, it must be approved by the Ministry. When it is necessary to increase employee dormitories, the method of self-building with public assistance should be considered first based on environmental conditions. The dormitory problem of new plants and mines should also be gradually resolved. Except for some new plants and mines located in remote areas, where there are neither reliable cities nor villages too far away, the construction ratio can be slightly larger, but the method of building as many houses as there are people and taking on everything is opposed. Capital construction units should pay attention to saving direct and indirect expenses such as building construction sheds. Temporary construction sheds should be built as permanent dormitories as far as possible according to the lowest standards, and then transferred to production for use. The coal, electricity, and petroleum professional general bureaus should immediately prepare a self-building with public assistance dormitory plan for 1955, 1956, and 1957 and include it in the formal plan for implementation. Each unit should designate a special person to help employees who build dormitories on their own with specific planning and preparation work to achieve more economical and practical results. Supply departments should assist in solving the necessary materials.
    All units should strictly control the use of steel materials and save steel materials in large quantities. In the future, all buildings, except those that require the use of steel materials due to technical requirements, will use substitute materials and are not allowed to use steel. In places where steel must be used, reasonable standards must also be strictly stipulated, and the coefficient should be reduced as much as possible. According to preliminary calculations, if the structural methods of the plant, substation, wind and water pipes, templates, temporary water supply pipes for construction, etc., are changed when constructing a thermal power plant with two 6,000 kW units, and concrete and other materials are used instead of steel, 243 tons of steel, 5 tons of foreign nails, 5 tons of steel wire, and 2,000 meters of iron pipes can be saved. Reducing the steel bars in the originally designed reinforced concrete power poles by 23% will not reduce the effectiveness of the power poles, and the cost will be 12% lower than the original design. Coal mines should also use reinforced concrete headframes instead of steel headframes as much as possible, and use less or no metal sheds.
    All decorations and unnecessary auxiliary equipment in all buildings, under the principle of not hindering production, should be cut off regardless of domestic or foreign designs. For decorative equipment that is absolutely necessary, the most economical and applicable standards should be adopted. The tendency of always choosing the highest and most beautiful standards in any design must be opposed.
    In the past, the waste caused by low design levels or design errors was one of the serious sources of waste in our current capital construction, which must attract the serious attention of our leading staff, especially in the design departments. In design, we must adhere to the firm policy of "applicability, economy, and taking care of aesthetics under possible conditions" instructed by the central government. We must carry out an irreconcilable struggle against all erroneous ideas and styles that are divorced from our country's current economic and people's living standards. The technical personnel and all staff of the design department must always treat their work with a spirit of high responsibility to the cause of the country and the people, and in every task and every link, they must fight to save every penny that can be saved for the people. In the future, the main equipment for production in the design can refer to Soviet standards, but domestic equipment that can be manufactured must be used as much as possible, and other aspects should adopt the lowest standards and the lowest cost as much as possible under the principle of technical permission. In order to ensure the emergency power consumption of other departments, when relocating old machines that are in operation, they should generally be disassembled and installed in their original state to fully utilize the original equipment, and necessary technical safety improvements can be carried out under the conditions of ensuring the progress of the construction plan and saving investment. The design department should deliver the engineering design drawings for the projects to be constructed in the first quarter of next year to the construction unit at the end of the third or the beginning of the fourth quarter of this year, giving the construction unit a certain amount of preparation time. Only in this way can confusion and waste be reduced. Those who already have the conditions should do better; those who do not have the conditions should start immediately, create conditions, and ensure completion. The planning department, especially the coal mine and petroleum geological exploration departments, should strive to create conditions to ensure that the design department completes this task. In geological drilling work, we must strictly implement the operating procedures to ensure the quality of drilling and reduce the losses caused by accidents to a minimum, which is the greatest saving. We should summarize the experiences and lessons well and educate all employees. We must save a lot of steel and recycle a lot of scrap steel. In particular, drill pipes, steel pipes, etc. used in coal mines and petroleum drilling cannot yet be manufactured in our country, so we should save even more.
    We must vigorously utilize stockpiled equipment. According to statistics, the total value of idle equipment in the Ministry of Fuel Industry system is about 360 million yuan. Now, the supply department should take the lead and actively study with the planning, design, and construction departments, and all usable equipment must be resolutely utilized, and plans should be made immediately for repairing equipment that needs to be repaired before it can be used. In the future, for the construction of new small coal mines, low-voltage transmission lines in the electricity industry, and production reforms and technical measures in various systems, existing idle equipment must be used as much as possible. We must oppose the idea of "preferring new over old" in the use of equipment. We must greatly reduce management costs. Some leading staff members mistakenly believe that "management costs account for very little of the cost, and there is no profit to be made," so they intentionally relax and ignore it, which is the root cause of management waste. Therefore, each professional system must immediately formulate a management fee expenditure system and resolutely implement it. It does not matter if the system is not perfect in the short term, it can be supplemented and revised in the future, but there must be a system and control; the bad behavior of spending money without counting and arbitrarily squandering national funds must be resolutely stopped. The work of streamlining institutions must also be carried out vigorously in accordance with the spirit of the central government. It is estimated that if the electricity production system can carry out reasonable staffing and adjust the structure, it can reduce 2,000 management personnel alone, saving 3.1 million yuan in direct expenses. In 1954, the proportion of management personnel to workers in the contracting units of the electricity capital construction system was only 1:1.75; if it can reach 1:3, the management personnel can be greatly reduced, and 4.9 million yuan in direct expenses can be saved. It can be seen that the potential for savings in this area is also very large. Finally, we must stop the phenomena of extravagance and waste in the administrative management organs and the lives of staff members. The various systems stipulated by the central government must be unconditionally implemented. According to a recent inspection within the Ministry of Fuel Industry, there are varying degrees of waste in housing, car use, receptions, office supplies, daily furniture, printing, telegrams, telephones, etc. Now, a new system must be formulated and announced for implementation, and the bureaus must also conduct inspections. We must start with the leading organs and leaders to establish a strict atmosphere of conservation. In order to ensure the smooth development of the work of increasing production and practicing thrift and economy, we must further strengthen the political work in enterprises and strengthen the Party's leadership over political work in enterprises. Combining the Party's political work with economic work is a basic link in strengthening the leadership of enterprises. We must systematically improve the political and ideological level and production enthusiasm of Party members and cadres; we must consolidate the relationship between Party members and cadres and non-Party masses; we must improve the political awareness of Party members and cadres and non-Party masses, and on the basis of these tasks, we must ensure the completion of the various indicators of the national plan in terms of quantity, quality, and cost reduction. From the perspective of enterprise administrative leadership, we must correct two deviations: one is to use the pretext of the one-leader system to act arbitrarily, not listen to the opinions of the collective, and not obey the leadership of the Party; the other is to rely on the Party committee, the collective, and meetings for everything, regardless of whether it is a major or minor matter, and not be responsible themselves. Doing a good job in political work in enterprises is the common responsibility of the Party organization and administrative cadres. The enterprise Party organization should arrange the ideological and political work plan based on the current economic tasks of the factory and mine. The factory and mine directors must listen to the criticisms of Party members, cadres, and workers at the Party member congress and at the meeting for reporting and summarizing work, constantly discover problems, and improve their work. Practicing thrift and economy is not only a major economic task, but also a serious political task. First, we require a major shift in ideological understanding; we must treat various issues with a spirit of high responsibility to the Party and the cause of the country; we must carry out propaganda and education on a large scale, mobilize and rely on all employees, carefully calculate accounts and tap potential from various departments and links, and save every penny that can be saved. In conservation work, we must resolutely oppose subjective idealism, localism, and the corrupt and hedonistic ideological behaviors of the bourgeoisie, and carry out a resolute struggle against all intentional or unintentional waste and the shameful behavior of squandering people's money. Units and individuals who have made good achievements in conservation should be encouraged and commended. For various wastes, appropriate criticisms and due punishments must be given separately according to different circumstances.

专栏：厉行全面节约，克服一切浪费

    响应中央号召，全面展开节约工作
    陈郁
    根据党中央和国务院关于厉行节约的各项指示的精神来检查燃料工业部的工作，无论在基本建设或生产方面，燃料工业系统中的浪费现象都是很严重的。
    在非生产性建设方面，建得过多、求全求备、“生产未好，福利先行”的现象是普遍的。重庆五○七电厂，修了一个可容纳现有职工人数一倍以上的大礼堂。他们的理由是开晚会和看戏时工人可以带家属来。为什么我们一定要为家属建戏院呢？北京文教区变电站八个人用了二百五十二平方公尺的宿舍，每人平均三十多平方公尺，不能不说是太多罢！而且自一九五三年以后，住宅造价一年比一年高，燃料工业部住宅造价平均起来达到了七十八元一平方公尺，高的达到一百多元。新疆石油公司宿舍造价达到五百多元一平方公尺。有些单位的办公室、学校的房子同样要求得太多、太好。矿业学院建筑造价一百四十元一平方公尺的办公楼，像一间大教室，却只有几个人办公，为了漂亮还盖了一座“五凤楼”。吉林电站计划建筑的办公室是二百一十三元一平方公尺。最突出的是隆昌炭黑厂的厕所，石油总局批准的是六元一平方公尺，但盖起来时竟达一百一十元，这是极端的无组织无纪律的行为。煤矿中不管矿井规模大小、新建或改建都要搞一套行政福利联合大楼；东北各矿务局无例外的都有休养所，而且一般的标准都过高。
    生产性建设的浪费也很严重，主要表现在好大厌小、喜新厌旧和盲目追求过高标准。不少的迁建、恢复和改建工程，往往都是大拆大换，造成不必要的损失。昆明迁移一套二千二百五十瓩的发电设备，把原来的设备换掉三分之二；这不仅浪费钱，也势必推迟建设时间。武昌迁建的一万五千瓩发电机，由于要求增加许多不必增加的新设备，设计预算高达一千三百万元，审查结果只需要四百多万元，比原设计还可把建设时间提早半年。大同煤峪口矿井虽名为改建，但实际上除井筒外全部等于新建，结果投资一千八百万元，由于设计变动数次，使生产时间推迟五年。
    新建工程也是如此。淮南煤矿安装的六千瓩发电机，是国内制造的捷克型设备，我们设计时不仅全部套用了苏联设计的六千瓩型设计，还增加了很多不必要的设备，结果增加投资二百万元。峰峰煤矿为了运煤，建设了一个造价昂贵的大石桥，群众称为“千年桥”。很多由国内设计的中、小型矿井和部分改建矿井，机械化程度要求高，技术条件安全系数大，也是造成工程造价高、浪费大的重要原因。
    几年来，基本建设虽基本上完成了任务，工程质量也基本上得到保证，但仍有不少的返工浪费。如有一个高级润滑油车间，因施工中检查不严，工程质量低，投入生产的时间较原计划推迟了五个半月，不仅达不到原计划产量，而且浪费投资百分之十五。如煤矿东山、彩屯、中央等竖井，质量都不够好，彩屯竖井移交生产后由于工程质量差，追加投资很大，造成浪费。
    原材料和设备的积压和浪费，在生产和基本建设中也都是很严重的。这样的例子更是举不胜举。
    燃料工业部系统在生产上的浪费也是惊人的。
    大家都知道石油是我国过渡时期最缺乏的物资，但是有些人对石油是不爱惜的。抚顺和锦西有“石油河”，玉门还有“石油湖”，我们的领导同志和职工同志对这些“河”和“湖”是熟视无睹的。石油二厂一九五四年第四季到一九五五年第一季从检油池流走的石油，仅由该厂自己捞回的就有二千吨。玉门“石油湖”每年冬天是附近群众的副业资源。玉门油矿在一九五五年，还打算用原油二千吨掺入沥青洒路压灰尘，这样来浪费国家最缺乏的资源的行为，难道是可以容忍的吗？
    煤矿和电业方面，浪费情况也是类似的。大同煤矿五月七日清点了四个工作面，即发现弃置的新坑木有二千二百零四根。华北电业局一九五四年发现有四十台变压器和开关，长期放在露天中日晒雨淋陷入泥里，有的已不堪使用。二十九个煤矿一九五四年一月到十一月，超支了六万四千立方公尺木料，值三百八十万元，火药九百六十吨，值一百九十万元。
    由于缺乏节约观点，有宽打宽用的思想，在行政管理上、劳动力使用上、资金及器材周转上的浪费也是很大的。一九五五年，燃料工业部基本建设管理费用是可以大大节约的。根据石油钻探系统计算，可以从原计划中核减百分之二十一点五。生产系统，中央规定每人办公费不得超过五至十元，但过去除个别单位外，每人都是十五至三十一元。重庆五○七电厂开工典礼花了五万二千元，为了讲究排场，买了全部中西餐用具，做了三百多套咔叽布工作服，只因颜色稍不一律，全部重新换做。黑龙江省的一个电厂还打算作呢子的工作服，办公室的墨水壶非用大理石的不可。
    由于劳动力的组织管理工作落后，企业管理机构庞大臃肿，造成的劳动力的浪费和非生产人员过多的现象也很普遍。狮子滩水电站工地，现有一万三千人，根据部和总局的检查，至少可减少二千人。过去由于人多，即使在施工紧张季节，每天也还要窝工四、五百人，有时到一千人。从工作效率看，土方工程竟低于国家定额百分之四十二点四，石土方工程低于国家定额百分之三十点五，这种情况是普遍的。除了窝工、效率低之外，就是工时利用率低，基建工地一般都在七小时以下。生产上的情况也不例外，据煤矿系统统计，一般只到五小时半左右。行政管理人员和非生产人员几年来增加的也很多。燃料工业部生产系统管理人员，一九五○年为全部职工的百分之七点五，一九五一年为百分之八点一，一九五二年为百分之九，一九五三年为百分之九点五，一九五四年为百分之九点六。根据已批准的机构定员草案核算，仅生产系统就可减少一万至一万三千人，如以每人每月平均工资六十元计，每年可节省工资七百二十万到九百三十六万元，如果加上福利建设管理费用，这数字就更大了。
    由于不重视资金周转，也造成流动资金的大量积压。一九五四年由于我们未完成资金周转计划，就积压了国家资金五千一百三十九万元，如果加上呆滞材料及超定额存储材料八千二百九十八万元，就有一万三千四百三十七万元。
    生产上安全供电也做得不好。一九五五年一至五月少供给用户电量二百二十万度，减少工业产值六百六十万元。煤的质量也不好，按国家标准，我们是受奖少受罚多。今年由于质量达不到标准，我们受罚二十万元。这充分说明了我们对产品质量很不重视。
    造成严重浪费的原因是什么呢？
    第一，因为我们没有深刻地认识到社会主义建设的长期性艰苦性，和艰苦奋斗对社会主义建设的严重意义，我们还有不少同志不了解我们资金来源的困难，往往不能把资金集中的使用在主要工业建设上去，相反地是把非生产建设同生产建设等量齐观，往往把非生产性的建设先作了，而同直接生产有关系的真正应该作的却未作好。
    第二，由于我们的政策思想水平低，对中央历次节约的指示体会不深，对节约工作的领导思想不够明确，对必须根据中国目前实际情况来确定合理的建设标准，和必须根据工农联盟的原则来考虑问题认识不足。几年来，未建立起严格的节约制度，已有的制度也未能认真贯彻，缺乏严格的财政监督制度，特别是缺乏深入地检查工作，没有坚决地同浪费现象进行无情的和有效的斗争。
    第三，缺乏经济观点，不注意用有限的财力、物力最合理地、最有效地为经济建设服务；没有在生产和基本建设的各个环节上实行精打细算，有只管建设不惜血本的思想。很多同志很少注意研究成本管理和资财使用，对严重的资财浪费和损失熟视无睹，因而也就很自然地不能把严格的经济核算制度提到更高的政治原则上来认识。
    第四，我们有严重的脱离实际的主观主义思想方法，因而盲目地追求新标准，离开我国当前的经济水平和生产水平来进行建设，不考虑充分利用原有的设备及国内制造能力。
    第五，我们还有不同程度的本位主义和享乐思想。如“宽打窄用”，借口重点工程，往往加大预算、提高标准；一般工程中定额不先进，标准不严格，无形中造成资金的大量积压和损失；在日常生活和非生产性的开支上，讲排场，讲阔气，讲漂亮，一掷千金，不以为怪。这些，实质上是一种资产阶级的享乐思想。
    为了增加生产、厉行节约，首先要求我们的领导工作人员和全体职工，在思想上明确认识节约的重大意义，从根本上扭转目前存在的各种不正确的思想，切实树立起厉行节约、克勤克俭、艰苦奋斗的风气，加强严格的经济核算思想，建立严格的节约制度。
    今后，所有的非生产性建筑除绝对必需者外一律不建，绝对必需的应经过部、总局的严格审查批准，并应采用最低的标准。原有生产厂矿一般增产不增人，必须增加人时，须经部批准。必须增加职工宿舍时，则应根据环境条件首先考虑以自办公助办法解决。新厂矿的宿舍问题也应逐步解决。除了部分新厂矿地处荒僻，既无城市可靠，又距乡村过远，建筑比例可以稍大外，反对有多少人就要盖多少房子，和大包大揽的办法。基本建设单位应注意节省修建工棚等直接间接的费用，要尽量少盖临时工棚。必须盖的工棚应尽量按最低标准建为永久性的宿舍，以后移交生产使用。煤、电、石油各专业总局应立即编制一九五五、一九五六、一九五七年自办公助的宿舍计划，列入正式计划执行。各单位应指定专人，帮助自建宿舍的职工进行具体的规划、准备工作，以达到更经济、适用。供应部门应当协助解决必需的材料。
    各单位应严格控制钢铁材料的使用，大量节省钢铁材料。今后一切建筑除技术要求必须使用钢铁材料者外，一律使用代用材料，不准使用钢铁。必须使用钢铁的地方，也得严格规定合理的标准，尽量降低系数。根据初步计算，建设一个两台六千瓩的火电厂，若将厂房，变电所，风、水管路，模板，施工的临时上水管等的结构方法加以改变，改用混凝土和其他材料代替钢材，即可节省二百四十三吨钢材，五吨洋钉，五吨钢丝，二千公尺铁管子。将原设计的钢筋混凝土的电杆的钢筋减少百分之二十三，不会减低电杆的效用，其造价要比原来的设计减少百分之十二。煤矿也应尽量使用钢筋混凝土井架，代替钢井架，不使用或尽量少用金属棚子。
    一切建筑物中的装饰及一切不必要的附属设备，在不妨碍生产的原则下，不论国内国外设计，应一律削掉，非要不可的属于装饰的设备，应采用最经济、适用的标准。必须反对任何设计都一定挑最高最漂亮的标准的偏向。
    过去，由于设计水平低，或设计思想错误所造成的浪费，是我们目前基本建设中严重浪费的根源之一，必须引起我们特别是设计部门的领导工作人员的严重注意。在设计中，必须坚持中央指示的“适用、经济、在可能条件下照顾美观”的坚定不移的方针。要同一切脱离我国当前的经济水平和人民生活水平的错误思想、作风进行不调和的斗争。设计部门的技术人员和一切工作人员，要时时刻刻、兢兢业业地以对国家和人民事业高度负责的精神对待自己的工作，在每件工作每个环节上，要为人民节约可能节约的每一分钱而斗争。今后设计中关于生产的主要设备，可以参考苏联的标准，但必须尽量采用国内可以制造的设备，其他方面在技术许可的原则下，尽量采用最低的标准和最低的造价。为了保证其他部门的紧急用电，正在运转的旧机器迁建时，一般的要原拆原装，充分利用原有设备，在保证建设计划进度和节约投资的条件下，可进行必要的技术安全的改进。设计部门应把明年第一季内要施工的工程设计图纸在今年三季末或四季初交付施工单位，给施工单位一定的准备时间，只有如此才能减少混乱和浪费。现在已有条件的应做得更好；尚无条件的，应立即动手，创造条件，保证完成。计划部门特别是煤矿、石油地质探勘部门应努力创造条件，保证设计部门完成这一任务。地质钻井工作中，要严格执行操作规程，保证钻探质量，把因事故而造成的损失减少到最低限度，这就是最大的节约。应很好地总结经验教训，教育全体职工。要大量节约钢材，大力回收废钢材。特别是煤矿、石油钻井中所用钻杆、钢管等，我国尚不能制造，更应加倍节约。
    要大力利用积压的器材。据统计，燃料部系统的闲置设备总值共有三亿六千万元左右。现在即以供应部门为主，积极地同计划、设计、施工各部门具体研究，一切能用的器材要坚决利用，需修复后才能使用的应立即作出计划进行修复。今后煤矿新建小井，电业的低压输电线路以及各系统中生产改革、技术措施等，必须尽量利用现有的闲置设备。反对使用器材上“喜新厌旧”的思想。要大量降低管理费用。有些领导工作人员，错误地认为“管理费用占成本很少，没有什么油水”，所以就有意地放松和不管，这是造成管理浪费的根源。因此各专业系统必须立即制定管理费开支制度，坚决贯彻执行。制度暂时不能尽善尽美不要紧，将来可以补充修订，但必须得有制度，有控制；花钱不计数，任意挥霍国家钱财的恶劣行为，必须坚决制止。机构精简工作，也必须根据中央的精神大力进行。据估计，电业生产系统如能进行合理的定员，调整机构，仅管理人员即可减少二千人，节约直接开支三百一十万元。电业基建系统的包工单位，一九五四年管理人员同工人的比例仅达一比一点七五；若能达到一比三，则管理人员可大大减少，可节省直接开支四百九十万元。可见这方面节约的潜力也是很大的。最后，必须制止行政管理机关和工作人员生活方面讲排场，比豪华的铺张浪费现象。中央规定的各种制度，必须无条件地贯彻执行。根据燃料工业部内近日的检查，在房屋、汽车使用、招待、办公用具、日用家具、印刷、电报、电话等方面，都有不同程度的浪费现象，现在要重新拟定制度公布执行，各局也必须进行检查，必须从领导机关领导人员带头做起，树立严格节约的风气。为了保证增加生产、厉行节约的工作顺利开展，就必须要进一步加强企业中的政治工作，加强党对企业中的政治工作的领导。把党的政治工作和经济工作结合起来，是加强企业领导工作的基本环节。必须有系统地提高党员干部的政治思想水平和生产积极性；必须巩固党员干部和非党群众的联系；必须提高党员干部和非党群众的政治觉悟，并在这些工作的基础上，保证在数量上、质量上以及降低成本上完成国家计划的各项指标。从企业行政领导方面来说，要纠正两种偏向：一种是借口一长制，独断专行，不听取集体的意见，不服从党的领导；另一种是不管大事小事都靠党委，都靠集体，都靠开会，自己不负责任。做好企业中的政治工作是党组织和行政干部的共同责任，企业党组织应从当前厂矿的经济任务出发来安排思想政治工作的计划，厂矿长必须在党员大会上、在报告和总结工作的大会上，虚心听取党员、干部和工人的批评，不断地发现问题，改进工作。厉行节约不仅是一个重大的经济任务，而且是一个严肃的政治任务。首先要求我们在思想认识上，有一个大的转变；必须以对党、对国家事业高度负责的精神来对待各种问题；必须大张旗鼓地进行宣传教育，发动和依靠全体职工，从各个部门、各个环节上算细账、挖潜力，节约可以节约的每一分钱。在节约工作中要坚决反对主观主义、本位主义和资产阶级腐化享乐思想行为，同一切有意无意的浪费和挥霍人民钱财的可耻行为进行坚决的斗争。对节约成绩好的单位和个人，应给以鼓励表扬。对于各种浪费，则必须根据不同情况分别给以适当的批评和应有的处分。
