    Changes in the "Natural Oil Mine"
    By Our Reporter Liu Fan
    In the movement to increase production and practice economy, some people often say: there's no "oil" to be squeezed from advocating economy in small departments and small factories! The facts of the Hangzhou Oil Refinery in Zhejiang Province moving from serious waste to initially overcoming waste refute this erroneous argument.
    The Hangzhou Oil Refinery has only one hundred and twenty-eight employees, and the average output value in the four years (1951 to 1954) was only 470,000 yuan. In the past, because the leading staff of the factory believed that the factory was small and the equipment was poor, it was unavoidable for the oil refinery to waste a little oil, and they long neglected the waste in the factory. As a result, from the establishment of the factory in 1951 to September of last year, the waste was extremely shocking. In the chemical workshop, a large amount of oil flowed on the ground every day, soaking the soil and the workers' shoes. Next to this workshop was a pond two mu in size and one zhang two chi deep. In the past, this pond grew lotus roots, water chestnuts, and wild rice stems. Later, the oil flowing out of the workshop and the dumped oil residue, spent clay, spent sulfuric acid, etc., turned this pond into an oil pond, killing all the life in the pond. According to calculations, the pond contained at least 700 tons of spent clay, spent sulfuric acid, etc., from which 269,120 jin of oil could be recovered; 588 tons of dilute acid could be recovered; and 356 tons of spent acid could be recovered. The calculable waste in this one pond alone amounted to 86,053 yuan, accounting for 18.3 percent of the factory's average output value for four years. In addition, there were four other ponds of varying sizes around the factory, and the surface of these four ponds was also covered with a thick layer of machine oil, kerosene, light sesame oil, and even valuable white oil. Can this be said to be a small amount of waste!
    During the plum rain season last year, the oil leaking from the factory flowed with the rainwater to the Hangzhou Caishi Bridge, more than ten li away, and floated on the Hangzhou-Nanjing Canal, which was hundreds of li long. Because the oil flowed with the water into the surrounding rivers, ponds, fields, mulberry fields, and bamboo gardens, the crops and mulberry trees withered, the bamboo did not produce shoots, and the fish were poisoned to death. Local residents went everywhere to sue the oil refinery for this matter, taking dead fish to the director's office and demanding compensation from the director. According to statistics, the factory has already paid 110 yuan in compensation.
    At that time, the masses inside and outside the factory were extremely dissatisfied with this serious waste at the oil refinery. Pointing to these oils that were like ground gold, they said that this was an inexhaustible "natural oil mine." However, the leading staff of the factory remained blind to these wasteful phenomena. There was an open-air warehouse about four mu in size in the factory, filled with countless oil drums. After years of exposure to the sun and rain, the iron drums rusted and broke, and the oil slowly flowed out of the broken holes. In the fourteen days of April last year, fifteen barrels of oil (360 jin per barrel) leaked out, and two barrels of light sesame oil leaked out in August and September. Precisely because the director believed that it didn't matter if the oil refinery wasted a little oil, some workers irresponsibly smeared a little soap on the leaking holes of the oil drums, without solving the problem of oil leakage. In June last year, the Hangzhou Electric Company erected electric poles outside the bamboo fence of the factory's open-air warehouse, digging a hole for the poles. When the linemen came to erect the poles the next day, the pole hole was already filled with oil.
    The workers were very dissatisfied with the serious waste at the oil refinery, and some workers had put forward several rationalization proposals. For example, worker Zhang Jinshui proposed recovering oil from spent sulfuric acid, but the director ignored this proposal. In August last year, He Qi'an, a worker in the boiler workshop, proposed experimenting with automatic oil discharge using air pipes, which could save manpower and prevent waste. The director only said "agreed" and then did nothing more about it. The workers were very angry that the leading staff of the factory did not care about this serious waste. Some workers said: "This pond of ours is full of gold. If we extract this batch of oil, we can build another oil refinery." Some workers sarcastically said: "It's a good thing the background boss is big (referring to state-owned), otherwise it would have gone bankrupt long ago."
    In August last year, the Hangzhou Municipal Industrial Bureau dealt with the problem of serious waste at the oil refinery, severely criticizing Director Wang Ziqian's bureaucratic and neglectful attitude towards economy. At the same time, the facts of waste were used to educate all the employees of the factory. At this time, the director began to wake up. Then, the higher-level Party committee sent people to strengthen the political work in the factory. From October 1st last year, the Chinese Communist Party organization and administrative leading staff of this factory took a series of measures to combat waste. The Party branch first conducted education on practicing strict economy from within the Party to outside the Party through reports, forums, and informal discussions, using past facts, and on this basis, mobilized all the employees of the factory to take action to overcome various wasteful phenomena in a step-by-step manner.
    In November last year, twenty-nine young workers in this factory organized a youth economy team. Their slogan was: Oppose waste anytime, anywhere! Go wherever there is waste! Since its establishment, the youth economy team has been dispatched thirty-six times, using lunch breaks, evening breaks, and holidays. They recovered 52,468 jin of oil from the pond; poured out 1,780 jin of discarded sulfuric acid from nearly 200 sulfuric acid jars; poured out 2,748 jin of discarded oil from oil drums; repaired 120 broken oil drums that had been discarded in the past; recovered 480 jin of scrap copper and scrap iron; and dug up 5,000 jin of oily mud from the oily ground in the open-air warehouse, supplying it to the boiler room as fuel for oil refining, saving 5,000 jin of coal. In these six items alone, the youth economy team saved the country 11,408 yuan.
    The activities of the youth economy team influenced all the workers in the factory. Nine middle-aged workers in the factory also joined the youth economy team. Later, whether the youth economy team picked up scrap copper and scrap iron or went to the pond to recover oil, the middle-aged and elderly workers in the factory followed suit. The youth economy team mobilized all the employees of the factory in the anti-waste struggle, and they became the bugle call in the economy movement of the oil refinery.
    Not only that, the workers in the factory also worked hard to find tricks and tap the potential for economy in their work. Zhu Bingyun, a worker in the boiler workshop, and Cai Baoshan, a technician, worked day and night to recover the losses from spent clay, spent sulfuric acid, etc. that had been poured into the pond, and successfully recovered oil from spent clay and dilute acid and spent acid for contact agents from spent sulfuric acid. From October last year to the present, the recovery of oil from spent clay and spent water alone has been 41,355 jin, worth 13,265 yuan. In June of this year alone, the recovery of dilute acid and the recovery of spent acid for contact agents were worth 13,600 yuan. This year, the entire factory can recover 460,000 jin of waste acid and 96,000 jin of dilute acid, saving the country 139,200 yuan in funds. He Qi'an, a worker in the boiler workshop, also created an automatic oil discharge air pipe in December last year, changing the long-term manual oil filling to air discharge, which not only saved manpower but also eliminated the loss of 12 jin of oil per day caused by manual oil filling in the past.
    The work of practicing economy and opposing waste at the Hangzhou Oil Refinery is still continuing. In early June, all the employees of the factory held a production increase and economy meeting. At the meeting, the weak links in the economy movement were identified, and the annual economy targets for this year were revised. All the employees are full of confidence and are working hard to achieve this target.

    “天然油矿”的变化
    本报记者　刘凡
    在增产节约运动中，有些人常常这样说：小部门、小工厂提倡节约没有什么油水！浙江杭州炼油厂从严重浪费到初步克服浪费的事实，驳斥了这个错误论调。
    杭州炼油厂只有一百二十八个职工，四年中（一九五一年至一九五四年）的平均产值只有四十七万元。过去，由于厂的领导工作人员认为厂小、设备差，油厂浪费一点油很难免，长期忽视厂里的浪费现象，结果从一九五一年建厂起至去年九月，浪费情况十分惊人。化学车间每天有大量的油流在地上，油浸湿了土、浸透了工人的鞋。这个车间的旁边有一个二亩见方、一丈二尺深的池塘，过去这池塘长着莲蓬、菱角、茭白，后来由车间流出去的油和倾倒的油脚，白土脚，硫酸脚等，使这个池塘成了油池，杀死了池里的一切生物。据计算，池塘内的白土脚、硫酸脚等最少有七百吨，可收回油二十六万九千一百二十市斤；可回收淡酸五百八十八吨；可回收酸脚三百五十六吨。单是这一个池塘里可以计算的浪费数字就有八万六千零五十三元，占这个厂四年平均产值百分之十八点三。此外，像这样大小不等的池塘在厂的周围还有四个，而这四个池塘的水面也浮有很厚的机油、煤油、软麻油以至贵重的白油，这能说浪费是不大吗！
    去年黄梅雨季节，从厂里漏出的油随雨水流入十里以外的杭州菜市桥，漂流在数百里长的杭宁（杭州至南京）运河上。由于油随水冲入周围的河塘、田庄、桑田、竹园，使庄稼和桑树枯死，竹子不出笋，鱼被毒死。当地居民为此事到处去控告炼油厂，拿着死鱼到厂长办公室要厂长赔偿。据统计厂里已支出赔偿费一百一十元。
    当时，厂里厂外的群众对炼油厂的这种严重浪费极为不满，他们指着这些满地黄金的油地说，这是一个流不尽的“天然油矿”。可是厂的领导工作人员对这些浪费现象仍然熟视无睹。这个厂里有个四亩地大小的露天仓库，里面躺着数不清的油桶，经过常年累月的日晒雨打，铁桶生锈破烂，油徐徐地从破孔口流出。去年四月间的十四天中漏掉了十五桶油（每桶三百六十斤），八、九月间漏掉两桶软麻油。正因为厂长认为油厂浪费点油无所谓，所以有些工人也就在油桶的漏孔处不负责地抹上点肥皂就算了，仍然没有解决漏油的问题。去年六月间，杭州电气公司在这个厂露天仓库竹篱笆外边架电杆，挖了个电杆坑，等到第二天电线工人来树电杆时，电杆坑里已灌满了油。
    工人们对炼油厂这种严重浪费的现象很不满，有的工人曾提出几次合理化建议。如工人张金水曾提出从硫酸脚里收回油的建议，而厂长对这个建议置之不理。去年八月，锅炉车间工人何其安提出试验用空气管自动放油，可以节约人力，又可堵塞浪费，厂长只说了一声同意，以后再无下文。工人们对厂里的领导工作人员不管这种严重浪费的现象很气愤，有的工人说：我们这口池塘内都是黄金，把这批油提出来，可以再建造一个炼油厂。有的工人挖苦地说：这样浪费亏得后台老板大（指国营的），否则老早倒灶了。
    去年八月间杭州市工业局对炼油厂严重浪费的问题进行了处理，严格地批评了厂长王自谦官僚主义和忽视节约的思想。同时，用浪费的事实教育了全厂职工。这时，厂长才开始清醒。接着，上级党委派人去加强了厂里的政治工作。从去年十月一日起，这个厂的中共党组织和行政领导工作人员采取了一系列反浪费的措施。党支部首先从党内到党外通过报告、座谈、漫谈的方式，用过去的事实进行了厉行节约的教育，并在这个基础上发动全厂职工动手有步骤地克服各种浪费现象。
    去年十一月，这个厂有二十九个青年工人组织了一个青年节约队，他们的口号是：随时随地反浪费，那里有浪费就到那里去！青年节约队成立以来，利用中午、晚间的休息时间和假日，出动过三十六次。他们从池塘中捞回油五万二千四百六十八市斤；在近二百只硫酸坛子中倒出抛掉的硫酸一千七百八十市斤；在油桶里倒出抛掉的油二千七百四十八市斤；把过去抛掉的一百二十个破油桶修理好；收回废铜废铁四百八十市斤；在露天仓库的油地上挖起五千斤油泥，供锅炉房作炼油燃料，节约了五千斤煤。仅这六项，青年节约队就为国家节约一万一千四百零八元。
    青年节约队的活动，影响了全厂工人，厂里有九个中年工人也参加了青年节约队。后来青年节约队无论是拾废铜废铁或是去池塘捞油，厂里的中年和老年工人都跟着一起做。青年节约队在反浪费斗争中把全厂的职工带动起来了，他们成了炼油厂节约运动中的号角。
    不仅如此，厂里的工人在节约工作中还努力找窍门，挖掘节约潜力。锅炉车间工人朱炳云和技术人员蔡宝山为了挽回白土脚、硫酸脚等倒入池塘去的损失，曾日夜钻研了从白土脚回收油，从硫酸脚回收淡酸和接触剂用的酸脚成功。从去年十月到现在，单从白土脚和水脚中回收油就有四万一千三百五十五市斤，价值一万三千二百六十五元。今年六月份，仅回收淡酸和回收接触剂用的酸脚两项，价值一万三千六百元。今年全年全厂可回收废酸脚四十六万市斤，淡酸九万六千市斤，能为国家节约资金十三万九千二百元。锅炉车间工人何其安也在去年十二月创造自动放油的空气管，变过去长期来用人力灌油为空气放油，既节省人力，又杜绝了过去因人力灌油每天有十二斤油的损耗。
    杭州炼油厂厉行节约、反对浪费的工作还在继续开展，六月上旬，全厂职工举行了一次增产节约会议，会议上找出了节约运动中的薄弱环节，修订了今年全年的节约指标，全体职工信心百倍地在为实现这个指标而努力。
