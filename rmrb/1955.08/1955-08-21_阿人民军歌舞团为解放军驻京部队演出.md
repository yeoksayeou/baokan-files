Xinhua News Agency, August 20th: The Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe performed at the Labor Theater on the evening of August 20th, entertaining troops and organs of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing. The spacious theater, which can accommodate nearly four thousand people, was filled with spectators in army, navy, and air force uniforms. Every performance by the song and dance troupe was warmly welcomed. The performers took bows two or three times, and some programs were repeated after prolonged applause.

　　The red curtain on the stage opened amidst the audience's sustained applause. The song and dance troupe first performed a magnificent chorus. Of the four songs performed, the Chinese folk song "The East is Red" and the Soviet song "We Defend Peace" were both sung twice. In the second part of the evening, the glorification hymn from the opera "Ivan Susanin," sung by the choir, was extremely well received. The performers took four curtain calls, but the audience's applause and cheers did not stop, and finally, the Russian folk song "Waves of the Amur River" was added.

　　Albania's four soloists all achieved great success tonight, and the five Chinese songs they sang were all performed twice. Male soloist Gjoni Athanas first sang the Chinese song "The Working Class Has Strength," and then sang "March of Victory" twice. When Avni Mula sang the Chinese folk song "In That Faraway Place," his moving and emotionally rich singing caused bursts of laughter from the audience.

　　At tonight's performance, the audience also enjoyed four beautiful Albanian dance programs. When the final program, the "Zërjani Dance," ended, literary and art workers from the land, sea and air forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army went on stage to present flowers to the song and dance troupe as a token of respect. At this moment, representatives of the people's armies of China and Albania applauded warmly together on and off the stage for a long time.

　　阿人民军歌舞团为解放军驻京部队演出
    新华社二十日讯　阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团二十日晚在劳动剧场演出，招待中国人民解放军驻京部队和机关。在可容纳近四千人的宽大剧场中，坐满了穿着陆、海、空军制服的观众。歌舞团表演的每一个节目，都受到了热烈的欢迎。表演者两三次地谢幕，有些节目在长时间鼓掌后重演了一次。
    舞台上的红色帷幕在观众们历久不息的掌声中拉开了。歌舞团首先表演的是雄伟的大合唱。演唱的四个歌曲中，中国民歌“东方红”和苏联歌曲“我们保卫和平”都重复演唱了一次。在晚会的第二部分，合唱队演唱的歌剧“伊凡·苏萨宁”中的光荣颂，受到极为热烈的欢迎。表演者四次谢幕还不能使观众的掌声和欢呼声停下来，最后又加唱了俄罗斯民歌“黑龙江的波涛”。
    阿尔巴尼亚的四位独唱家今晚都获得很大的成功，他们演唱的五支中国歌都重唱了一次。男声独唱家久尼·阿达纳斯先唱了中国歌曲“咱们工人有力量”，接着又把“胜利进行曲”唱了两遍。阿夫尼·穆利亚演唱中国民歌“在那遥远的地方”的时候，他那种感人的情感丰富的歌声，引起了观众们一阵阵的欢笑。
    在今天的晚会上，观众还欣赏了四个优美的阿尔巴尼亚舞蹈节目。当最后一个节目“兹尔江组舞”结束后，中国人民解放军陆、海、空军部队的文艺工作者上台向歌舞团献花致敬。这时，中阿两国人民军队的代表们在台上台下一齐长时间地热烈鼓掌。
