Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, August 9th – According to TASS, Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, issued a statement to the press on August 8th. The statement said that the achievements of the Geneva Conference marked a new and welcome stage in international relations, and the people of all countries expressed extreme satisfaction with the achievements of the Geneva Conference. Peace fighters were excited, especially because they had been working tirelessly around the world for many years to promote such a meeting, and they believed that such a meeting would powerfully prove that the true path to peace lies only through talks, not through a policy of strength. The major events of recent months—the global movement to fight for peace and oppose preparations for atomic war, the cooperation of peace forces demonstrated by the Helsinki Peace Assembly—have largely helped to express public opinion. The Geneva Conference marked a major step forward on the road to ending the Cold War and ending the division of the world into two hostile blocs.

The statement pointed out that a spirit of mutual trust has begun to replace distrust and suspicion, and a favorable atmosphere has now been created for resolving international differences. However, there are still some difficult tasks ahead of us.

The statement pointed out that specific solutions to some of the issues discussed at the Geneva Conference are awaiting the Foreign Ministers' meeting to seek, and that the Asian issue, the issue of China's status and rights, and the issue of banning nuclear weapons, issues of extreme importance to world peace, were not discussed at the Geneva Conference. The statement said that the Geneva Conference made a start in a good transformation conducive to maintaining peace. But it would be a dangerously reckless idea to think that the great forces keen on continuing the Cold War would not hinder the road to peace. Recognizing this difficulty requires the peace movement to carry out its activities with greater perseverance and tireless effort.

The statement said that peace movements in all countries should redouble their efforts to reflect public opinion, show a high degree of vigilance, and expose all conspiracies that attempt to hinder the success of future talks. The statement said that the peace movement should promote the sincere search by all parties in the consultation for solutions that can be accepted by all. The peace movement should publicize the resolutions made on various issues related to maintaining peace at large-scale conferences or peace congresses—such as the Helsinki Congress. The activities of peace movements in all countries should make future talks feel the strong and clear will of the people of all countries. They should help public opinion show such strength that it is truly possible to reach agreements on the destruction of nuclear weapons and universal disarmament, on the organization of collective security systems, on the restoration of German unity, guaranteeing the elimination of the possibility of the revival of German militarism, and on improving relations between East and West. Public opinion should firmly and very clearly express its views on the destruction of nuclear weapons, the German issue, and some important issues in Asia and the Far East. The statement pointed out that the movement that has already begun, such as the movement to collect signatures for the "Appeal to the Peoples of the World," should continue and deepen. Countries should launch movements to more resolutely demand the normalization of relations between all countries and China, and demand that this great country be able to enter the United Nations. It is very obvious that if this is not done, the issues of Asia and universal, supervised disarmament cannot be reasonably and permanently resolved.

The statement concluded by saying that the Geneva Conference has had good results, and the people of all countries are making every effort with new confidence that their actions will definitely be effective, so that in this new stage of the struggle for peace, new and great victories will finally be won.

    就四国政府首脑会议后和平运动的任务
    约里奥—居里发表声明
    新华社九日讯　据塔斯社维也纳讯：世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里八日向报界发表声明。声明说，日内瓦会议的成就标志着国际关系进入了新的和可喜的阶段，各国人民对日内瓦会议的成就表示极其满意。和平战士感到兴奋，特别是因为他们许多年来就不断在世界各地努力促成举行这样的会晤，他们相信，这样的会晤将有力地证明：走向和平的真正道路只有通过会谈，而不是通过实力地位政策。最近几个月来的大事争取和平、反对准备原子战争的世界性运动，赫尔辛基和平大会所表现的和平力量的合作——在很大的程度上帮助了公众舆论的表达。日内瓦会议标志着在向着结束冷战、终止把世界分裂为两个敌对的集团的道路上前进了一大步。
    声明指出，相互信任的精神开始代替不信任和怀疑，现在已经为解决国际分歧创造了有利的气氛。但是，我们面前还有一些困难的任务。
    声明指出，在日内瓦会议上所讨论的一些问题的具体解决办法正有待外长会议来寻求，而且，亚洲问题、中国的地位和权利问题和禁止核子武器问题，这些对世界和平具有极其重大意义的问题在日内瓦会议上没有被讨论到。声明说，日内瓦会议为有利于维护和平的良好转变作了一个开端。但是如果认为热中于继续冷战的巨大势力不会阻碍走向和平的道路，那将是一种危险的轻率想法。意识到这种困难，就要求和平运动以更大的毅力不倦地展开活动。
    声明说，各国和平运动应该加倍努力地反映舆论，表现高度的警惕性，揭露一切企图阻碍今后会谈获得成功的阴谋活动。声明说，和平运动应当促进协商的各方真诚地寻求可以为大家所接受的解决办法。和平运动应当宣传在大规模的会议上或是和平大会上——如赫尔辛基大会上就关系到维护和平的各项问题作出的决议。各国和平运动的活动应当使未来的会谈感觉到各国人民的坚强的和明确的意志。它们应当帮助舆论显示这样的力量，使得真正能够达成关于销毁核子武器和普遍裁军，关于组织集体安全体系，关于恢复德国统一、保证消灭德国军国主义复活的可能性，关于改善东西方关系的协议，舆论界应当坚决地和十分明确地就销毁核子武器、德国问题和亚洲及远东的一些重要问题表示意见。声明指出，已经开始的运动，如为“告全世界人民书”征集签名的运动应该继续和深入下去。各国要展开运动更加坚决地要求各国同中国的关系正常化，要求使这个伟大的国家能够进入联合国，十分明显，如果不做到这一点，亚洲的问题和普遍的、有监督的裁军问题就得不到合理的、永久的解决。
    声明最后说，日内瓦会议有了良好的结果，各国人民怀着相信自己的行动一定会有效果的新的信心来尽一切努力，使得在这个为和平而斗争的新阶段最后获得新的巨大的胜利。
