Shanghai Has Great Potential for Saving Gasoline
　　Zhang Chongwen, Deputy Manager of China Petroleum Corporation Shanghai Branch

Based on surveys and information gathered from key gasoline-using units in Shanghai, the irrational use and wastage of gasoline are currently quite serious in the Shanghai area.

First, there is a surplus of vehicles and transportation capacity. Taking 1952 as 100, the number of various gasoline-powered vehicles in Shanghai increased to 149.24 in 1955. Taking the city's gasoline consumption in 1952 as 100, it rose to 295.82 in 1954. Not only has the number of vehicles increased too quickly, but the annual gasoline consumption has also far exceeded the growth rate of vehicles.

Although the number of vehicles has increased rapidly, the vehicle utilization rate is not high. Currently, there are still a considerable number of vehicles wasting transportation capacity and being idled. For example, in Shanghai's taxi company, except for a portion of vehicles used for hospitality, the remaining small rental cars are rarely rented by customers. In the first quarter of this year, an average of 27.02 vehicles were driven each month, accounting for only 25% of the planned average. Various organizations and groups also have surplus private cars. For example, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau have 126 more private cars than the original establishment (not including unlicensed, unused, large, and medium-sized vehicles). As for the surplus private cars scattered among hundreds of enterprises in the city, it is estimated that there are about 300.

The large number of private vehicles in various enterprises has invisibly caused waste in usage. Many enterprises in Shanghai have a large number of large vehicles to facilitate the transportation of employees to and from work. One shipyard has 32 shuttle buses with approximately 29 routes (not including the four night shift routes), operating 66 times a day. The fuel consumption of these vehicles is at least 90 tons per year. Some units, such as the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, often drive long distances to invite university students to attend the factory's entertainment evenings. If calculated at four round trips per vehicle, totaling 96 kilometers (distance between the factory and the school), it would consume 40 liters of gasoline. In addition, this factory also has five special vehicles to transport employees' families to the city on holidays, consuming 2,000 liters of gasoline per year. (Other factories also have similar situations.) If these units pay attention to making full use of the existing transportation in the city, the private shuttle vehicles can be saved.

Secondly, the general fuel consumption quotas are too high. Based on the average statistical data of fuel consumption in the first quarter of this year, the fuel consumption of the same type of vehicle varies greatly. For example, for the same 5-ton Dodge truck, the Shanghai Railway Bureau consumes 35.81 liters of fuel per 100 kilometers, while the transportation team of the First Construction Engineering Company of the Shanghai Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau requires 54.75 liters; for the same 3-ton Dodge truck, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company consumes 24.44 liters of fuel per 100 kilometers, while the Shanghai Smelting Plant requires 37.14 liters; for the same 3-ton ZIS truck, the Shanghai Branch of the Jiangsu Provincial Automobile Transportation Company consumes 26.01 liters of fuel per 100 kilometers, while a certain shipyard requires 44.94 liters. Shanghai is a city with many factories and many vehicles. If we calculate the excess fuel consumption, the wasted gasoline will be staggering!

Thirdly, the mileage utilization rate of vehicles is low, with more empty runs than loaded trips. According to surveys, the actual mileage utilization rate of vehicles in the Shanghai area generally reaches only 40% to 50% of the total mileage, with 41% to 60% of the mileage being empty runs without full utilization. Why is the empty running rate so high? On the one hand, it is because the parking lot is too far from the loading and unloading location, and on the other hand, it is because the vehicles are not well organized. More importantly, there is a lack of unified dispatch and unified management, with each unit only considering its own convenience. The parking lot of the First Engineering Company of Shanghai is more than 20 kilometers away from the loading location, while the loading location is only one kilometer away from the unloading location. If calculated at 25 loading and unloading trips per day, the loaded mileage is only 25 kilometers. A vehicle working for a day will have its empty running portion exceeding the loaded portion by more than two times. If centralized management and unified dispatch can be implemented, many empty running phenomena will be reduced.

Why are the irrational use and wastage of gasoline so serious? First of all, the leaders of some units do not pay enough attention to saving gasoline, believing that wasting a little gasoline is a "small matter" and "not a big deal." Some leaders even think that since gasoline is easy to buy, using more or less is an internal matter of the unit and does not need to be restricted, so they turn a blind eye to it. Some units, such as the First Construction Engineering Company of the Shanghai Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, have drivers who compete for red flags and personal honors by stepping on the gas pedal and speeding up to complete transportation tasks, without considering fuel economy at all. Therefore, the fuel consumption of the motorcades of this company has almost broken the city's highest record.

Secondly, the fuel management system is unsound. Some factory vehicles do not have odometers at all, and there is no record of how many miles they travel each month and how much fuel they use, so there is no talk of saving fuel.

From the above situation, it can be seen that Shanghai has great potential for saving gasoline. And some units have already made achievements in saving gasoline. For example, the vehicles of the Shanghai Public Transport Company, although used for urban public transport and have more stops, consume more fuel than ordinary vehicles. However, because the company's Party and government leaders have attached importance to this issue, actively led employees to uniformly improve carburetors and metering orifices, and deeply carried out fuel-saving campaigns, the fuel consumption has decreased month by month, saving 700,000 liters (about 50 tons) of gasoline in the past year alone. The vehicles of the Storage and Transportation Section of the East China Supply and Marketing Branch of the Ministry of Textile Industry consumed 46.55 liters of fuel per 100 kilometers in 1954. In the first quarter of this year, due to the establishment of a special gasoline saving group, the improvement of the management system, and the implementation of a unified dispatch method, the fuel consumption per 100 kilometers has been reduced to 29.5 liters by the end of May, and the fuel consumption of some vehicles has been reduced to 24.51 liters. In Shanghai, the gasoline used in large buses and trucks accounts for more than 75% of the total demand. If these vehicles can generally reduce fuel consumption by 10%, the gasoline saved can provide fuel for 20 million ton-kilometers of vehicle travel. In other words, the original annual fuel consumption can at least last for more than one and a half years. Facts have proved that the idea of ​​purchasing convenience and not caring about using a little more or a little less is completely wrong.

In order to save more gasoline, we suggest that all fuel-using units in Shanghai establish savings organizations, establish necessary systems, regularly go deep into the field, inspect waste, and eliminate unreasonable usage. Timely summarize the experience of saving fuel, introduce and promote it. Trucks in the transportation and enterprise sectors should gradually move towards centralized management and unified dispatch, and implement planned transportation and cyclical transportation methods to improve the load factor of vehicles. Surplus transportation vehicles should gradually be stopped, and attention should be paid to reducing two-way transportation and vehicle return empty rates. All enterprise units should mobilize and persuade employees to make full use of nearby public vehicles and gradually stop the practice of using transportation vehicles to pick up and drop off door to door. Finally, the education of automobile drivers and maintenance personnel should be strengthened, overcoming outdated views and various forms of conservative thinking, learning anti-knock fuel-saving devices and other advanced experiences, and striving to improve technical skills. Drivers and other relevant personnel who have made significant achievements in saving gasoline should be rewarded.

In this way, in terms of gasoline use, resolutely implementing the principle of "do not use what can be used or not, and save what must be used" can save more gasoline for the country and use it where it is truly needed to accelerate my country's socialist construction.

    上海市节约汽油的潜在力量很大
　　中国石油公司上海分公司副经理　张充文
    根据上海市对使用汽油的重点单位进行调查和了解的资料，目前上海地区对汽油使用得不合理和浪费汽油的现象是比较严重的。
    首先是车辆和运输力都有多余。上海地区各种使用汽油的车辆，以一九五二年为一百，一九五五年增加到了一百四十九点二四。市内汽油消耗量，以一九五二年为一百，一九五四年上升到二百九十五点八二。不仅车辆增加过快，而且汽油的逐年消耗量又远超过车辆增长的速度。
    车辆虽然增加很快，但车辆使用率并不高。目前浪费运输能力和搁置停驶的车辆还不在少数。如上海的汽车出租公司，除了一部分供作招待使用的车辆外，其余出租的小座车，因客人租用少，今年第一季度每月平均行驶车辆为二十七点零二辆，仅占计划平均行驶车辆的百分之二十五。各机关团体自备小座车也有多余，如中共上海市委、上海市人民委员会、市公安局等单位，自备小座车超过原来编制一百二十六辆（无照未使用和大中型车辆还不计算在内）。至于分散在市内数百个企业单位中多余的小座车，据初步估计，大约有三百辆左右。
    各企业单位自备车辆多，无形中造成使用上的浪费。上海市有不少企业单位，为了照顾职工上下班方便，自备有数量较多的大型车辆。有一个造船厂自备交通车三十二辆，行驶路线约二十九条
  （还不包括四路夜班车），每天开行六十六次，这些车辆所耗油量，全年至少要在九十吨以上。还有些单位，如上海柴油机厂，经常远程开车邀请大学学生参加本厂文娱晚会。如果按每车每次往返接送四次，共行九十六公里（厂和学校距离）计算，就得耗费四十公升汽油。另外，这个厂每逢假日还备有专车五辆，专门接送职工家属到市区来，一年就要耗费两千公升的汽油。（其他厂也有这种情况）这些单位如果注意充分运用市内现有的交通工具，自备接送车辆是可以省掉的。
    其次是一般耗油定额偏高。以今年第一季度耗油量平均统计资料来看，同样车辆的耗油量相差很大。如同是五吨道奇卡车，上海铁路局每百公里耗油量为三十五点八一公升，而上海市建筑工程局第一建筑工程公司运输队则需五十四点七五公升；同是三吨道奇卡车，闸北水电公司每百公里耗油量为二十四点四四公升，而上海冶炼厂则需三十七点一四公升；同是三吨奇姆西卡车，江苏省汽车运输公司上海分公司每百公里耗油量为二十六点○一公升，而某造船厂则需四十四点九四公升。上海是工厂企业多、车辆多的城市，如果我们把那些耗油量的超耗部分计算一下，浪费掉的汽油将是惊人的！
    第三是车辆行驶里程利用率低，跑空多于载重。据调查，上海地区车辆实际行驶里程利用率一般只达全部行驶里程的百分之四十至五十，有百分之四十一至百分之六十行驶里程是放空，没有充分利用的。为什么空驶率这样高呢？这一方面是因为停车场距离装卸地点太远，一方面是由于没有把车辆很好地组织起来；而更重要的是缺乏统一调配，统一管理，各单位只顾自己方便。上海市第一工程公司停车场距离装货地点二十多公里，而装货地点距离卸货地点只有一公里，如每天按装卸二十五次计算，其载货行驶只有二十五公里。一辆车工作一天，其空驶部分将超过载重部分两倍以上。如果能够集中管理，统一调配，就会减少很多空驶现象。
    为什么汽油使用不合理和浪费现象会这样严重呢？首先，某些单位的领导人员对节约汽油不够重视，认为浪费点汽油是“小事情”、“没有多大关系”。有些单位的领导人员甚至认为汽油反正买起来方便，多用少用是单位内部的事情，不必要受什么约束，因此不闻不问。还有些单位，如上海市建筑工程局第一工程公司，司机人员为了完成运输任务来争夺红旗和个人荣誉，在行车中多踏油门，加快速度，根本不考虑节约用油的问题，所以这个公司开出来的车队，耗油量几乎打破了全市最高的纪录。
    其次是用油管理制度不健全。有的厂的车辆根本没有路码表，每月行驶了多少路，用了多少油，根本没有记载，因此更谈不上节约了。
    从上述情况可以看出，上海市节约汽油的潜在力量是很大的。而且有些单位在节约汽油方面已经作出了成绩。如上海市公共交通公司的车辆，虽然是供市区公共交通使用，停靠站头较多，比一般车辆费油；但由于公司党、政领导重视了这个问题，积极领导职工统一改进汽化器和量孔，深入开展节油运动，耗油量逐月降低，仅在去年一年中就节约汽油七十万公升（约五十吨）。纺织工业部华东供销分局储运科的车辆，一九五四年的耗油量每百公里为四十六点五五公升，今年第一季度由于专门组织了汽油节约小组，并改进管理制度和实行统一调配的办法，到五月底为止，耗油量每百公里已降低至二十九点五公升，有的车辆耗油量已降低至二十四点五一公升。上海汽油用在大客、货车占整个需要量的百分之七十五以上。假使这些车辆都能普遍降低耗油量百分之十，那末节约下来的汽油，可供二千万吨公里汽车行驶的燃料。也就是说，原来一年的耗油量至少可供一年半以上的消耗。事实证明，认为购买方便，多用一点，少用一点，没多大关系的想法是非常错误的。
    为了节约更多的汽油，我们建议上海市各用油单位成立节约组织，建立必要的制度，经常深入现场，检查浪费并消除使用不合理的现象。及时总结节约用油的经验，加以介绍和推广。运输和企业部门的货车，应逐步走向集中管理，统一调度，并实行计划运输和循环运输的办法，以提高车辆的载重率。多余运输车辆应逐步停驶，并注意减少相向运输和车辆回空率。各企业单位要动员和说服职工，充分利用附近的公共车辆，逐步停止挨门逐户用交通车辆接送的办法。最后，应加强对汽车驾驶和检修人员的教育，克服守旧观点和各种形态的保守思想，学习抗爆节油器以及其他各项先进经验，努力提高技术水平。对于节约汽油有显著成绩的司机及其他有关人员，应该给予奖励。
    这样，我们在使用汽油方面，坚决贯彻“可用可不用者不用，必须使用者省用”的原则，就可以为国家省下更多的汽油，用到真正迫切需要的地方去，以加速我国社会主义建设。
