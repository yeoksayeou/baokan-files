　　Casablanca Dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, August 26: On the morning of August 25th, French colonial troops, in 100 trucks and under the cover of 35 tanks and 40 armored vehicles, continued to advance deep into the Middle Atlas Mountains of Morocco to launch an offensive against the Berbers who support former Sultan Yusuf. French military aircraft also searched the area.
　　Currently, the situation remains very tense throughout Morocco. The Oud Echchem and Khouribga areas, as well as the Tadla region, have been declared "dangerous zones" by the French authorities. Some farms have been converted into fortresses for the French colonial army. Armed patrols crisscross every road in these areas. Military transport convoys travel day and night on the main roads. In areas under French control, vast wheat fields are deserted, and Moroccan villages are uninhabited.
　　Despite this, brave Moroccan patriots continue to resist. In the Middle Atlas Mountains, the Berbers, armed with old rifles, daggers, and sabers, valiantly fight against the invading French troops. Reuters reported that throughout Morocco, telephone lines are being cut and utility poles are being destroyed. The colonial authorities often cannot communicate with many areas because the telecommunications equipment, which is repaired during the day, is destroyed by the Moroccan people at night.
　　In Algeria, French colonial police and troops continue to massacre local people in many places. In vast areas, the colonialists have been met with resistance from local patriotic people.
　　Beirut Dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, August 26: The National Congress Party of Lebanon decided on August 25th to call for a general strike in Lebanon on August 31st, and to hold demonstrations that day to protest France's policies in North Africa.
　　Beirut Dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, August 26: TASS Beirut Dispatch, August 26: According to reports from Damascus, the new Syrian President Kuwatly, speaking to a delegation of youth and students, said that he believes in the unity of the Arab countries and is ready to make any sacrifice to achieve this unity.
　　He said that Syria is watching the struggle of the people of Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, and, together with other Arab countries, is extending a helping hand to the "fighters for freedom and independence."
　　Naples Dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, August 26: A delegation organized by the Italian Communist Youth Federation visited the French Consulate in Naples on August 25th and submitted a petition protesting the French massacre of North African residents and demanding the withdrawal of French troops from Morocco and Algeria.

　　法国殖民者继续在摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚进行血腥镇压
　　黎巴嫩等国人民支持北非人民的斗争
    新华社二十六日讯　卡萨布兰卡消息：二十五日清晨，法国殖民军队分乘一百辆卡车，在三十五辆坦克和四十辆装甲车的掩护下，继续深入摩洛哥的中亚特拉斯山区，向支持前苏丹优素福的柏伯尔人展开进攻。法国的军用飞机也到这个地区上空进行搜索。
    目前，摩洛哥各地局势仍然非常紧张。欧德柴姆和库里布加区域以及塔德拉一带已经被法国当局宣布为“危险区”。一些农场已经被改为法国殖民军的堡垒。武装的巡逻队在这些地区的每条路上往返巡逡。交通大道上军事运输车队不分昼夜地来来去去。在法军控制下的地区，大片麦田上空无一人，摩洛哥人的村庄里也没有人烟。
    尽管如此，英勇的摩洛哥爱国者继续在进行抵抗。在中亚特拉斯山区，柏伯尔人拿着古老的来福枪、匕首、马刀等，奋勇抗击入侵的法国军队。路透社报道说，在摩洛哥全境，电话线被割断和电线杆被毁坏的情事不断发生。殖民当局常常不能同许多地区通消息，因为白天刚修好了电讯设备，黑夜就被摩洛哥人民破坏了。
    在阿尔及利亚，法国殖民军警继续在许多地方屠杀当地人民。在广大地区里，殖民者遭到了当地爱国人民的抗击。
    新华社二十六日讯　贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩国民大会党二十五日决定号召八月三十一日在黎巴嫩举行总罢工，并且在那一天举行示威，抗议法国在北非政策。
    新华社二十六日讯　塔斯社贝鲁特二十六日讯：据大马士革来的消息说，叙利亚的新总统库瓦特利向一个青年和学生代表团发表谈话时说，他相信阿拉伯国家的团结，并且准备作任何牺牲以实现这种团结。
    他说，叙利亚注视着阿尔及利亚、突尼斯和摩洛哥人民的斗争，并且同其他阿拉伯国家一起，正在给“争取自由和独立的战士”伸出支援的手。
    新华社二十六日讯　那不勒斯消息：意大利共产主义青年团组织的代表团二十五日访问了法国驻那不勒斯的领事馆，递交请愿书，抗议法国对北非居民的屠杀，并且要求法国军队从摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚撤退。
