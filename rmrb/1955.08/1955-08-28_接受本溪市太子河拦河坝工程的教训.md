　　Learn from the Lessons of the Taizi River Dam Project in Benxi City

To the Editor:

　　In Jianchang and Nantai Mountain villages, upstream of the Taizi River in eastern Benxi City, there are approximately 2,000 mu of land, of which only 300 mu are paddy fields, and the rest are all dry land. The Benxi City Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry decided to build a dam in this area to use river water for irrigation and to reclaim paddy fields. However, shortly after the dam was completed, it was completely destroyed by floods. In addition to the loss of over 75,000 yuan in construction materials and labor costs, the 1,377 mu of rice fields that had already been developed using river water experienced a reduction of more than 460,000 jin of rice. The vast majority of the rice produced was also not ripe, which severely affected the lives of local farmers.

　　Why did such a good thing turn into a bad thing? The leaders of the City Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry blindly designed and constructed the project without conducting a thorough survey. For example, they blindly designed the dam foundation to be driven into the riverbed to a depth of one meter to one meter and four without investigating the depth of the rock layer at the bottom of the river. In reality, the rock layer of the riverbed was very deep, and the dam was built on floating sand. They also subjectively believed that the riverbed was always half water and half dry, so they blindly designed the dam as a hybrid dam with one side made of gray stone piles and the other side made of wooden piles with branches and sand in between; but in reality, whenever the river flooded in the summer, it was not only not half water and half dry, but the water was vast and the water level rose from the usual 1.5 meters to 4.05 meters. A dam built according to the design would inevitably be washed away during a flood. The Northeast Bureau of Water Conservancy raised objections to this faulty design twice in its instructions, but the leaders of the Benxi City Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry did not seriously study the instructions from higher authorities and blindly proceeded.

　　Because the Benxi City Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry did not do a good job in preparing for construction, the construction period was delayed by three months and did not begin until April 1954. This delayed the farmers' sowing time by half a month. After the dam construction began, the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry sent Jin Wenbin, the head of the agricultural section, to the construction site to preside over the work. After arriving at the construction site, Jin Wenbin acted arbitrarily and took charge of all affairs, rendering the original water conservancy construction committee virtually useless. At that time, some people raised the opinion that "this dam will definitely not be built securely" and some rationalization proposals, but Jin Wenbin ignored them all. When farmers were busy with spring plowing, he brutally closed the sluice gates and cut off the water source to force the masses to provide labor. In addition, he also embezzled public funds for eating, drinking, and entertainment. Due to such a series of irresponsible actions by the Benxi City Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, it finally caused huge losses to the state and the masses.

　　After local farmers jointly filed a complaint with the Ministry of Supervision, the Benxi City People's Committee and the Benxi City Supervisory Committee have investigated and dealt with this incident, and the responsible personnel have been given the disciplinary sanctions they deserve.

　　At present, the number of small-scale water conservancy projects being built in rural areas across the country is considerable. Because they are small-scale, they are often easily overlooked, leading to mistakes. The incident of the Benxi City Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry causing losses due to irresponsibility in the construction of the Taizi River dam is worth learning from.

### 接受本溪市太子河拦河坝工程的教训

　　接受本溪市太子河拦河坝工程的教训编辑同志：
    本溪市东部太子河上游碱厂、南台山两村，共有土地两千亩左右，其中水田只有三百亩，其余全是旱田。本溪市农林局决定在这个地方修建拦河坝，以便利用河水灌溉，开垦水田。但是，拦河坝完工后不久，就被洪水全部冲毁。除了工料费损失达七万五千多元外，已经利用河水开辟的一千三百七十七亩稻田共减产了稻谷四十六万多斤，所产的稻谷绝大部分也都没有成熟，这使当地农民生活受到了严重的影响。
    为什么这样一件好事会办成了坏事呢？原来市农林局领导人员对这一工程没有进行周密的勘测就盲目地设计、施工了。例如，他们没有勘查河底岩层的深度就盲目设计河堤基础打入河底一公尺到一公尺四深，实际上河床岩层很深，堤坝就筑在浮沙上面了。他们又主观地认为河床里经常是一半水、一半干，就盲目把河坝设计成一面用灰桩石龙、一面用木桩中间放上枝柴和沙子的混合式河坝；但是实际上每当夏季河水暴涨的时候，不仅不是半水半干，而且水势浩大，水位曾由平时的一点五公尺上涨到四点○五公尺，按照设计所筑的水坝在河水暴涨的时候必然会被冲垮。对于这个错误的设计，东北水利局曾两次在批示中提出意见，但是本溪市农林局领导方面并没有认真研究上级指示，就盲目地干起来了。
    由于本溪市农林局没有做好施工的准备工作，因此施工日期延迟了三个月，到一九五四年四月才开始。这就使农民播种的时间耽误了半个月。河坝开始施工后，农林局派农业科长金文斌到工地主持工作。金文斌到达工地后，就独断独行，包办一切事务，使原来的水利修建委员会形同虚设。当时有的群众提出“这坝一定修不住”的意见和一些合理化建议，金文斌也毫不理睬。当农民忙于春耕的时候，他又粗暴地关闭水闸、断绝水源，来强迫群众出民工。另外，他还贪污公款来吃喝玩乐。由于本溪市农林局这样一连串的不负责任，终于给国家和群众造成巨大的损失。
    经当地农民联名向监察部提出控告以后，本溪市人民委员会和本溪市监察委员会已经对这一事件作了检查和处理，并已给失职人员以应得的纪律处分。
    目前各地农村兴修小型水利工程的数量是不少的。因为是小型，也就往往容易被忽视而形成错误。本溪市农林局修建太子河拦河坝不负责任而造成损失的事件是值得引为教训的。
