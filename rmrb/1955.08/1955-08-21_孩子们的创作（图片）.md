　　Soong Ching Ling, Chairman of the Chinese People's National Committee for the Defense of Children, is viewing the climate record book of the weather observation group of the Yimiao District Central Primary School in Shanghai at the National Juvenile and Children's Science and Technology and Craft Works Exhibition.

　　Nearly a thousand models, instruments, specimens and handicrafts exhibited at the exhibition were all made by the children themselves. These works fully demonstrate the children's rich wisdom and creative talent. The six exhibits above were all made by children.
