Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 11th: According to newspaper reports, under the auspices of the Indian parties' committee to support the liberation of Goa, approximately three thousand volunteers will enter Goa on August 15th, India's Independence Day, to hold demonstrations demanding the return of Goa to India. Preparations are actively underway throughout India for this action.

The public in Delhi held a gathering at Delhi City Hall on the 9th to bid farewell to a group of 101 volunteers from Delhi, including members of various political parties, trade union members, students, and women. Speakers at the meeting said that Asians would no longer tolerate any form of colonialism.

Dr. Lanka Sundaram, convener of the Goa issue committee of Indian parliamentarians from various parties, announced that another group of volunteers composed of Indian parliamentarians would soon leave Delhi to participate in the Goa liberation movement.

Volunteers from East Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bombay Province, and other places will also go to Goa.

In Belgaum in southern Bombay Province (where all volunteers gather before setting off to enter the Goan border), the local residents are extremely enthusiastic. They have raised funds and food for the volunteers and are prepared to provide medical assistance and transportation.

The "Times of India" reported on the 10th that patriots inside Goa are secretly preparing for the large-scale entry into Goa on August 15th.
