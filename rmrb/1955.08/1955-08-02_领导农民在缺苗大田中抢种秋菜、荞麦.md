    Leading Farmers to Rush-Plant Autumn Vegetables and Buckwheat in Fields with Missing Seedlings
    Zhao Qi
    Many regions in the north experienced drought during the spring sowing and summer planting stages this year, and some regions also experienced insect pests, resulting in a considerable number of fields with missing seedlings and broken rows. Utilizing the gaps in these fields with missing seedlings to rush-plant some seasonal crops is a pressing and important task for these regions.
    Before "Start of Autumn," farmers in the northern regions traditionally plant autumn vegetables such as radishes, turnips, and mustard greens, as well as buckwheat, in the fields. The agricultural production leadership departments in these regions should, based on the farmers' existing habits, immediately lead the farmers to expand the planting area of these crops, and replant all the fields with missing seedlings and broken rows. According to farmers' experience, in fields with one-tenth of the seedlings missing, replanting radishes or turnips can increase the yield of autumn vegetables by three to four hundred catties per mu; replanting buckwheat can increase the yield of buckwheat by one to twenty catties per mu. These increased production figures should be taken seriously.
    Although autumn vegetables such as radishes and turnips are not grains, they are important supplementary foods for farmers, as well as good feed for livestock. If farmers can harvest a certain amount of autumn vegetables, they can not only solve their own lack of vegetables, but also supply the needs of people in nearby small and medium-sized cities with the surplus, increasing farmers' income.
    The time for replanting autumn vegetables and buckwheat is precisely the stage of intensive summer hoeing, so it is necessary to guide farmers to arrange various farm work properly, and at the same time do a good job in inter-tillage, pest control, and replanting autumn vegetables. Most areas are short of autumn vegetable seeds this year, and agricultural production leadership departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in various places should pay attention to helping farmers solve the problem of seed shortage.

    领导农民在缺苗大田中抢种秋菜、荞麦
    赵起
    北方许多地区在今年春播、夏种阶段发生干旱，有些地区还发生了虫害，因此有不少大田缺苗断垅。利用大田中的缺苗隙地，抢种一些适时的农作物，是这些地区当前一件紧迫而重要的工作。
    “立秋”以前，北方地区的农民有在大田中种植萝卜、蔓菁、芥菜等秋菜和荞麦的习惯。这些地区的农业生产领导部门，应该依据农民原有的习惯、立即领导农民扩大这些农作物的种植面积，把缺苗、断垅的大田都补种上。根据农民的经验，在缺苗十分之一的大田中，补种萝卜或蔓菁等，每亩可增收秋菜三、四百斤；补种荞麦，每亩可增收荞麦一、二十斤。对这些增产数字是应该重视的。
    萝卜、蔓菁等秋菜虽不是粮食，但它是农民的重要的辅助食品，同时也是牲畜的好饲料。农民如能收获一定数量的秋菜，不但可以解决本身缺乏蔬菜的问题，多余的还可以供应附近中小城市人民的需要，增加农民的收入。
    补种秋菜、荞麦的时间正是紧张的夏锄阶段，因此必须领导农民安排好各种农活，同时做好中耕、除虫、补种秋菜等工作。今年大部地区都缺乏秋菜种子，各地农业生产领导部门和供销合作社应注意帮助农民解决缺乏种子的问题。
