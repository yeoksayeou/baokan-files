    The Vietnamese People Struggle for Peaceful Reunification
　　——Celebrating the 10th Anniversary of the Founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
    September 2 this year marks the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. After eight years of arduous and heroic resistance, the Vietnamese people achieved the realization of peace in Indochina in July 1954. After the Vietnamese armistice, the Vietnamese people faithfully fulfilled the various provisions of the Geneva Accords and are now striving to hold consultative conferences with the South Vietnamese authorities to realize general elections and struggle for the reunification of the motherland. At the same time, the Vietnamese people have also been engaged in the restoration and construction of the national economy. Over the past year, the Vietnamese people have vigorously repaired railways and highways, consolidated and developed state-owned enterprises. In the first half of this year, the state's investment in state-owned enterprises (excluding public utilities such as water, electricity, and defense enterprises) increased ninefold compared to the entire previous year. In the countryside, the masses are actively mobilized to participate in rent reduction movements and land reform movements. The restoration of water conservancy and irrigation systems has irrigated more than 250,000 hectares of farmland, promoting the development of agricultural production, and actively expanding the facilities of cultural and educational undertakings. Due to the restoration and development of production, the people's material and cultural lives are also gradually improving.

    越南人民为和平统一而斗争
　　——庆祝越南民主共和国成立十周年
    今年九月二日是越南民主共和国成立十周年纪念日。经过八年艰苦、英勇抗战的越南人民，在一九五四年七月取得了印度支那和平的实现。越南停战后，越南人民忠实地履行了日内瓦协定的各项条款，现在正在争取和越南南方当局举行协商会议实现普选，为统一祖国而斗争。与此同时，越南人民还进行了国民经济的恢复建设工作。一年多来，越南人民大力修复铁路和公路，巩固和发展国营企业，今年上半年国家投在国营企业（公用企业如水、电及国防企业除外）中的资金比去年全年增加了九倍。在农村里积极发动群众参加减租运动和土地改革运动。水利灌溉系统的修复，使二十五万多公顷的农田得到了灌溉，促进了农业生产发展，并积极扩充了文化教育事业的设施。由于生产的恢复和发展，人民的物质生活和文化生活也正在逐步的提高。
