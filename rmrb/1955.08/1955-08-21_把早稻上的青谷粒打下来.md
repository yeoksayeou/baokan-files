　　Knock Down the Green Grains on the Early Rice
　　To the Editor:
　　This year, when the early rice in my district, Taishan Township, was heading, it was flooded, and some rice ears were broken. After the water receded, some rice ears grew on the nodes, so that during the Great Heat season, the rice was still yellow and green, not fully mature. If we cut it, the green ones are still filling and heading; if we don't cut it, the yellow ones will sprout. Because the farmers still have to seize the time to rush to plant late rice, they have to cut it with pain, so many green grains are left on the rice stalks (because the green grains cannot be knocked off). Some farmers think that these green grains don't matter. Li Qianbai, a poor peasant in Ximen Village, took his rice stalks with green grains and burned them as firewood. The grains crackled as they burned, and his children picked them up and ate them in front of the stove. I randomly took a handful of rice stalks in the Taishan Agricultural Production Cooperative and counted them. There were 722 grains that had not been knocked off, which is about eight qian of grain. If we calculate that there are 7,200 plants per mu, and 32 plants per handful of rice stalks, then each mu will lose more than 11 jin of grain. The whole cooperative has 232 mu of early rice that has been flooded, which means a loss of about 2,600 jin of grain. The whole township has 1,735 mu of early rice. If we extrapolate from this, the loss is really alarming! Therefore, after calculating the accounts, the Taishan Agricultural Production Cooperative decided to temporarily keep the 80,000 jin of rice stalks that were originally intended to be fed to cattle and distributed to the members for burning by each production team. After the autumn harvest, when there is surplus labor, the rice stalks will be spread on the drying ground and rolled once with a stone roller to collect the grains that have turned yellow from green (after the rice is harvested, the green grains will slowly turn yellow after losing nutrients) to avoid losses.
　　Based on the above situation, I suggest that all early rice areas that have been flooded should mobilize farmers to conduct a general inspection of the green grains left on the rice stalks, and try to find ways to get them down, so as to truly achieve "every grain returns home."

### 把早稻上的青谷粒打下来

　　把早稻上的青谷粒打下来编辑同志：
    今年我区台山乡早稻出穗时受到水浸，部分稻穗折断，水退以后禾节上又长出一些稻穗，以致大暑时期稻子还有黄有青，没有完全成熟。割吧，青的正在灌浆吐穗；不割吧，黄的又要生芽。由于农民还要抓紧时间抢栽晚稻，只有忍痛割去，这样很多青的谷粒就留在稻秆上（因为青谷粒是打不脱的）。有些农民认为这些青谷粒要不要无所谓，西门村贫农李前柏就把自己带有青头谷粒的稻秆拿去当柴烧，烧得谷粒“劈啪，劈啪”直响，他的小孩就到灶门前捡来吃。我在台山农业生产合作社随便拿了一把稻秆数了一下，没有打脱的谷粒有七百二十二粒，约合八钱谷。如果以一亩田七千二百兜、三十二兜禾一把稻秆计算，每亩田就要损失十一斤多谷。全社有二百三十二亩受水浸过的早稻，无形中就要损失粮食二千六百斤左右。全乡一千七百三十五亩早稻，如果照此推算，损失真是惊人！因此，经过算账以后，台山农业生产合作社决定把原先打算给牛吃和分给社员烧掉的八万斤稻秆暂由各生产小组保管，到秋收后有剩余劳力时把稻秆铺在晒场上，用磙子磙一次，把已经由青变黄了的谷粒收拾起来（稻子收割后，青谷粒失去养份会慢慢变黄），以免造成损失。
    根据以上情况，我建议凡是受过水浸的早稻地区，应该动员农民普遍检查一次稻秆上所剩的青谷粒，尽量设法把它弄下来，真正做到“颗粒还家”。
