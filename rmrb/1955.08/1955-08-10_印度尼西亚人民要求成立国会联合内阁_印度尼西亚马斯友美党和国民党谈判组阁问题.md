Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 9th: Political parties and organizations from many parts of Indonesia are constantly sending representatives to the capital, Jakarta, to demand the establishment of a National Assembly coalition cabinet.

A delegation of forty people representing ten political parties and organizations from Bandung, West Java, visited National Assembly Speaker Sartono on the morning of August 8th, demanding the formation of a National Assembly democratic cabinet. This cabinet should hold general elections according to the original schedule, normalize relations between the government and the army, and eliminate armed bandits such as the "Darul Islam movement" and the "Indonesian Islamic Army," which have caused so much suffering to the people of Bandung.

Prior to this, a delegation of fifty people from East Java had visited Vice President Hatta, the Executive Committee of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, and National Assembly Speaker Sartono on the 5th and 6th. During their meeting with Sartono, they presented him with resolutions passed by people from various regions opposing a presidential cabinet and demanding the establishment of a National Assembly cabinet with broad support from the National Assembly, guaranteeing democratic freedoms and rights.

According to a report by the Indonesian News Agency on the 6th, one of the representatives told a reporter from the Indonesian News Agency that the intention of guaranteeing democratic freedoms and rights in the resolution submitted to Speaker Sartono was to prevent the recurrence of the "August arrests" incident during the Sukiman government in 1951. The same report quoted another representative from Surabaya as saying that he did not want to see those whose names had been stained by events such as the "August arrests" and currency devaluation participating in the cabinet.

Fourteen representatives from Lamongan, East Java, who arrived in Jakarta, also made the same request in written opinions submitted to Burhanuddin Harahap, who was tasked with forming the cabinet.

A delegation composed of various political parties from South Sumatra also expressed the hope for the establishment of a truly democratic government.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 9th: According to the Indonesian News Agency, Burhanuddin Harahap, leader of the Masyumi Party, who was tasked with forming the cabinet, announced on the 9th that he had submitted the list of personnel he wanted the Indonesian Nationalist Party to include in the new cabinet to the Nationalist Party and was awaiting a response. He said that the Nationalist Party's response would determine whether his planned new cabinet would include the Nationalist Party.

The news said that the Nationalist Party had proposed that A.K. Gani, Minister of Transportation in the Sastroamidjojo cabinet, and Abdu'l Gani, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, serve as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs in the new cabinet, respectively.

Prior to this, Harahap had held talks with Nationalist Party leaders on the 8th, during which Harahap expressed opposition to the Nationalist Party's original proposed ministerial candidates for the new government, particularly opposing Hadi as a candidate for Deputy Prime Minister and Sunarjo as a candidate for Minister of Foreign Affairs. Harahap said that he hoped the Nationalist Party's candidates for the new cabinet would include one of the Nationalist Party's leaders, Wilopo, and the current Indonesian Ambassador to the United States, Moekarto Notowidigdo.

At the same time, Masyumi Party leaders held a meeting on the 8th to discuss the issue of forming a new cabinet, particularly discussing which Masyumi Party leader would serve as Prime Minister. According to Antara News Agency, Wibisono and Harahap have been nominated as candidates for Prime Minister.

    印度尼西亚人民要求成立国会联合内阁
    印度尼西亚马斯友美党和国民党谈判组阁问题
    新华社雅加达九日电　印度尼西亚许多地方的政党和团体不断派遣代表到首都雅加达来，要求成立国会联合内阁。
    从西爪哇万隆来的代表十个政党和团体的四十人代表团在八日上午访问了国会议长沙多诺，要求成立一个国会民主的内阁，这个内阁应该按照原定日期举行大选，使政府同陆军之间的关系正常化，消灭像万隆人民深受其害的“回教国运动”和“印度尼西亚回教军”这样的武装匪徒。
    在这以前，从东爪哇来的五十人代表团曾在五日和六日先后访问了副总统哈达、印度尼西亚国民党执行委员会、国会议长沙多诺。他们在会见沙多诺时，把各地人民所通过的反对总统制内阁，要求成立一个得到国会广泛支持的、保障民主自由权利的国会内阁的决议交给了他。
    据印度尼西亚新闻社六日报道，其中一位代表对印度尼西亚新闻社记者说，交给沙多诺议长的决议中所说的保障民主自由权利的用意是要求防止一九五一年苏基曼政府当政时的“八月大逮捕”事件的重演。同一个消息引述另一位来自泗水的代表的话说，他不希望看到那些因为“八月大逮捕”、货币贬值等事件而使其名字染上污点的人参加内阁。
    从东爪哇拉蒙岸来到雅加达的十四位代表，在向受命组阁的伯汉努丁·哈拉哈普提出的书面意见中，也提出了同样要求。
    来自苏门答腊南部的由各政党组成的代表团也表示希望成立一个真正民主的政府。
    新华社雅加达九日电　据印度尼西亚新闻社报道，受命组阁的马斯友美党领袖伯汉努丁·哈拉哈普九日宣布，他已经把他要求印度尼西亚国民党参加新内阁的人员名单交给国民党并且等待答复。他说，国民党的答复将决定他计划组织的新内阁是否包括国民党。
    消息说，国民党已经提出沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁的交通部长阿·克·干尼和外交部秘书长阿卜杜加尼担任新内阁的副总理和外交部长。
    在这以前，哈拉哈普在八日曾同国民党领袖举行会谈，在会谈中哈拉哈普表示反对国民党原先提出的新政府的部长候选人，特别反对哈迪为副总理候选人和苏纳约为外交部长候选人。哈拉哈普说，他希望国民党参加新内阁的人选包括国民党的领袖之一韦洛坡以及现任印度尼西亚驻美大使慕加多·诺托维迪基多两人。
    同时，马斯友美党领袖们曾在八日举行会议讨论组织新内阁问题，特别是讨论马斯友美党领袖中谁将担任总理职务问题。据安塔拉通讯社报道，维比索诺和哈拉哈普已被提名为总理候选人。
