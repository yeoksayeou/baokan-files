　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 30th: The Japan-China Friendship Association recently issued a statement demanding that the Japanese government adopt a correct attitude towards issues such as the repatriation of overseas Chinese.

　　The statement first mentioned the situation pointed out by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai regarding the enslavement and massacre of tens of thousands of Chinese people who were abducted to Japan during the war. The statement said: For several years, various Japanese mass organizations have launched memorial services for Chinese martyrs and movements to return their remains.

　　The statement pointed out: However, the Japanese government has not expressed any support for this movement, and has not even made accurate investigations into the sacrificed personnel, so that a large number of people are still missing. Needless to say, the Japanese government's attitude has not repaid the Chinese government's friendly policy of assisting Japanese expatriates in returning to their country.

　　The statement continued: Not only that, but the Japanese government is also conducting one-sided propaganda, saying that there are still 40,000 Japanese people remaining in China, deliberately spreading propaganda that distrusts China.

　　The statement emphasized: We firmly demand that the government stop making such untrue propaganda, fulfill its own responsibilities, engage with China in a friendly manner, and take active measures on trade and other issues to strive for the normalization of relations between the two countries.

　　Konno Jiro and Hasebe Gisuke, permanent directors of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, also issued statements, pointing out that the Japanese government's demand for China to repatriate 40,000 Japanese people is unfounded. They advocated that the Japanese government should agree to hold negotiations with China to restore diplomatic relations.

　　日中友协要日政府正确对待中日关系问题
　　指出日本政府应停止在遣返侨民问题上的不符事实的宣传
    新华社三十日讯　东京消息：日中友好协会在不久前发表声明，要求日本政府对遣返侨民等问题采取正确的态度。
    声明首先谈到中国周恩来总理指出的在战争期间被掳到日本的成千成万的中国人被奴役和被屠杀的情况。声明说：几年来，日本各群众团体发起举行了中国殉难烈士追悼会和送还遗骨的运动。
    声明指出：但是，日本政府对于这个运动没有表示任何支持，连对牺牲人员的精确调查都不去作，以致大批人至今仍然下落不明。不消说，日本政府的这种态度没有报答中国政府援助在华日侨回国的友好政策。
    声明继续指出：不仅如此，日本政府还正在进行片面宣传，说现在还有四万名日本人留在中国，故意散布对中国不信任的宣传。
    声明强调说：我们坚决要求政府停止作这种不符合事实的宣传，尽它自己应尽的责任，以友好的态度同中国接触，并且进一步对贸易和其他问题采取积极措施，争取两国邦交正常化。
    日本工会总评议会的常任干事今野治郎和长谷部仪助也发表谈话，指出日本政府要求中国遣返四万日本人是没有根据的。他们主张日本政府应该同意和中国举行恢复邦交的谈判。
