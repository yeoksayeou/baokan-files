    Watching the Feature Film "Hassen and Gamila"

    The feature film "Hassen and Gamila" currently showing is a scroll depicting the lives and struggles of the Kazakh people of Xinjiang before and after liberation. It has a touching story, distinct ethnic characteristics, a strong sense of life, poetic details, and thrilling scenes of struggle. The natural and social landscape of the Kazakh region, their customs, the noble qualities of the Kazakh people such as kindness, diligence, bravery, and simplicity, and the pure-gold love of young Kazakh men and women who fear neither fire nor water, all shine brightly in the artistic tapestry, deeply moving us.

    This is not a simple love story, but a magnificent poem depicting the anti-feudal and anti-oppression struggles of young Kazakh men and women. The heroic struggles of Hassen and Gamila to fight for freedom of marriage and freedom of life broke the gap in the ancient and cruel system of marriage by purchase, stirring up broad social waves. Freedom-loving young men and women took them as models to learn from, warmly praising and actively supporting them; while the big landlord Junus and his son, along with the Kuomintang bandit army, regarded them as heretics, subjecting them to frantic persecution and cruel encirclement. It was not until the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang and the victorious meeting of the People's Liberation Army and the local ethnic armed forces that this pair of lovers, who had endured countless hardships and the pain of separation and death, returned to their hometown and gazed at their new life amidst the cheers of the masses celebrating liberation. This film uses vivid artistic images to tell the audience a great truth: the fate of the individual is inseparable from the fate of the collective and the fate of the revolution.

    The images of Hassen and Gamila are vivid and have a strong moving power. The life characteristics and personality characteristics of Hassen are a generalization of the life characteristics and personality characteristics of the broad masses of young Kazakh herders. Hassen, who lives in the grasslands among herds of horses, not only possesses the excellent qualities common to ordinary working people, but is also as open-minded as the grasslands and as bold and strong as a steed. On a summer morning, he sings such a love song on the hillside to Gamila across the river:

    I saw you on the other side of the Ertix River,
      Quickly make your earrings into a boat to carry me across,
      If you are not happy, if you are unwilling,
    Even if you are a fairy in the sky, I will ignore you.

    This is not only the burning of youthful passion, but also the shining of the sharp edges of a bold character like the grassland and the steed. Here we see the beating of a heart as clear as crystal. This beautiful heart attracted another beautiful heart – Gamila’s heart – like a magnet attracts iron.

    Gamila grew up in an ordinary herding family. She has the tenderness of a young maiden and the strength of a working woman. She understands the value of freedom of marriage and what true love is. When she snuggles with Hassen by the water and sees a pair of beautiful reflections in the pool, she sees her future free and happy life. But Padeshberk, the son of the big landlord Junus, intervened, insisting on buying her body with a large number of livestock. This was a strangulation of her love and a strangulation of her free life. Dark clouds covered her bright heart, and she felt the heavy pressure of the persecutors. But she knew that there was no other way out but to resolutely resist. She would spare no cost to exchange for freedom of marriage and freedom of life! She cut off a lock of her hair with a knife and gave it to Hassen, saying, "Here, if we can't be together, I swear to you, Hassen, I won't let you down!" This is a young girl's oath of allegiance to love, and it is also a solemn declaration of war by courageous youth against the old society!

    At the same time that Gamila "swore" to Hassen, Junus and Gamila's father, Bessen, were staging the ugly drama of "discussing marriage" according to their "rules," using the number of livestock to measure Gamila's worth: an asking price of seventy, a counter-offer of forty, and finally, both sides agreed to forty-five. These two contrasting shots so strikingly reveal the conflict between the new and the old, good and evil, and beauty and ugliness, making the audience feel that the storm of struggle is about to break out.

    In the process of fighting for freedom of marriage and freedom of life, Hassen and Gamila are subjected to rigorous tests, just like a piece of iron in a furnace, becoming stronger with each refinement. To escape cruel pursuit, they cross high mountains and steep ridges, delve into forests and caves, twist cotton into tinder, weave cradles for newborn babies from branches, and welcome birds as guests to celebrate the baby's "one-month" milestone. They use outstanding ingenuity and abundant optimism to overcome wind and snow, overcome hunger, and overcome all the difficulties that appear before them. And in the dark prison, encouraged and helped by Han Chinese prisoners, Hassen again uses the courage and ingenuity to overcome nature, together with other prisoners, overcomes shackles and iron gates, rushes to the ranks of the revolution, and wipes out the fleeing remnants of the enemy. This is the triumph of the oppressed people's freedom of marriage and freedom of life.

    The characteristic of this film lies not only in the touching storyline, but also in the strong local flavor. The film prominently depicts the details of certain local customs, making the characters' thoughts and feelings appear natural and true. The scene of "chasing girls" not only fully expresses Gamila's personal love and hate, but also expresses the herders' hatred for Junus and his son and their sympathy for Hassen and Gamila. When Gamila uses a whip to knock Padeshberk off his horse, the masses feel as if they have vented their anger, uttering humorous satires at Padeshberk and bursting into roaring laughter. When Gamila is forced to hold a wedding, we also see detailed descriptions that profoundly express Gamila's thoughts and feelings. When a porcelain bowl filled with "holy water" (water that has been chanted over) and covered with white paper falls from Gamila's hand and shatters on the ground, we hear the scream of a captive free soul!

    The film's shortcomings are that the characters' personalities are not prominent enough, and the development of Hassen and Gamila's thoughts and personalities in the midst of cruel struggle is not vivid enough. In pursuing the simplicity of the shots, the director seems to have somewhat neglected the richness of the content contained in the screenplay. The branches and leaves of the film do not show the abundance they should, so that the poetry that permeates the script cannot be fully expressed on the screen. But in any case, the director and actors' hard work has achieved remarkable results. Some Kazakh actors have appeared on the screen for the first time and have achieved such results, which is very worthy of attention. (Attached picture)

    Hassen rescued Gamila from the big landlord Junus's house, and the two fled to live in the deep mountains.

    看故事片“哈森与加米拉”
    章越
    编剧：王玉胡、布哈拉　导演：吴永刚　副导演：王力　上海电影制片厂出品
    正在放映的故事片“哈森与加米拉”是表现新疆哈萨克族人民在解放前后的生活和斗争的画卷，有曲折动人的故事，有鲜明的民族色彩和浓烈的生活气息，有富有诗意的细节描写和惊心动魄的斗争场景。哈族地区的自然面貌、社会面貌和风俗习惯，哈族人民的善良、勤劳、勇敢、纯朴的高尚品质，哈族青年男女的不怕火烧、不怕水淹的纯金一般的爱情，都在艺术织锦中放光发热，使我们深深感到激动。
    这不是单纯的恋爱故事，而是描写哈萨克族青年男女反封建、反迫害斗争的壮美的诗篇。哈森和加米拉为了争取婚姻自主和生活自由而进行的英勇的搏斗，打破了古老的、残酷的买卖婚姻制度的缺口，激起了壮阔的社会波澜。爱好自由的男女青年们把他俩当作学习的榜样，加以热烈的歌颂和积极的支援；而大牧主居奴斯父子和国民党匪军则把他俩看作离经叛道的罪人，加以疯狂的迫害和残酷的围攻。直到新疆和平解放、人民解放军和当地民族军胜利会师的时候，这对受尽千辛万苦、饱尝生离死别的辛酸的恋人才回到自己的家乡，在群众庆祝解放的欢呼声中凝视着面前的新生活。这部影片用鲜明的艺术图景告诉观众一个伟大的真理：个人的命运同集体的命运和革命的命运不可分割。
    哈森和加米拉的形象是鲜明的，有强烈的感人力量。哈森的生活特征和性格特征，是哈族广大青年牧工的生活特征和性格特征的概括。生活在草原上的马群中的哈森，不仅具有一般劳动人民共有的优良品质，同时还像草原一般的开朗，骏马一般的豪放和坚强。在夏天的早晨，他在山坡上对着小河对岸的加米拉高唱这样的情歌：
    在额尔齐斯河对岸看见了你，
      快把耳环做成船把我载过去，
      假若你不高兴，你不情愿，
    你就是天上的仙女我也不再理你。
    这不仅是青春的热情的燃烧，而且是草原和骏马一般的豪放性格的锋芒的闪耀，我们在这里看到一颗水晶一般明净的心的跳动。这颗美丽的心像磁石吸铁似地吸住了另一颗美丽的心——加米拉的心。
    加米拉是在普通的牧民家庭生长的，她有妙龄少女的柔媚，也有劳动妇女的坚强。她懂得婚姻自主的价值，懂得什么是真正的爱情。当她同哈森在水边偎依着，在水潭里看到一对美丽倒影的时候，她就看到了自己未来的自由幸福的生活。可是大牧主居奴斯的儿子帕的夏伯克插了进来，硬要用大批牲口来购买她的肉体，这是对她的爱情的扼杀，也是对她的自由生活的扼杀。她的明亮的心空罩上了浓重的乌云，她感到迫害者的压力的沉重。但她知道除了坚决反抗之外，没有别的出路，她不惜用任何代价去换取婚姻自主和生活自由！她用小刀割下一绺头发，赠给哈森，对他说：“给你，万一我们不能在一起的话，我向你发誓，哈森，我不给你丢人！”这是天真少女忠于爱情的盟誓，也是勇敢的青春向旧社会宣战的庄严的誓词！
    在加米拉向哈森“宣誓”的同时，居奴斯们和加米拉的父亲贝森们却按照他们的“规矩”，扮演
  “议亲”的丑剧，用牲口的头数来衡量加米拉的身价：讨价七十匹，还价四十匹，最后双方同意四十五匹。这两个对比的镜头，那样突出地揭露了新和旧、善和恶、美和丑的冲突，使观众感觉到斗争的暴风雨马上要爆发了。
    在为婚姻自主和生活自由而斗争的过程中，哈森和加米拉经受着严格的考验，正如熔炉里的铁块，越炼越坚强。为了躲避残酷的追捕，他们越过高山峻岭，深入森林山洞，用棉花搓出火种，用树枝为初生孩子编成摇床，以飞鸟为庆贺孩子“满月”的客人。他们用出色的机智和充沛的乐观主义精神战胜了风雪，战胜了饥饿，战胜了一切出现在他们面前的困难。而在黑暗的牢狱里，在汉族囚犯的鼓励和帮助下，哈森又用战胜自然的勇敢和机智，同其他囚犯们一起战胜了枷锁和铁门，奔赴革命的队伍，扫荡逃走的残敌，这是被压迫人民的婚姻自主和生活自由的凯旋。
    这部影片的特色不仅在于故事情节的曲折动人，而且在于地方色彩的强烈。影片突出地描写了当地某些风俗习惯的细节，使人物的思想感情自然而真切地表现出来。那“追姑娘”的场景，不但充分表现了加米拉个人的爱憎，而且表现了牧民群众对居奴斯父子的憎恶和对哈森、加米拉的同情。加米拉用马鞭把帕的夏伯克打下马来的时候，群众感到出了气似的快意，对帕的夏伯克吐出幽默的讽刺，发出轰然的笑声。在强迫加米拉举行婚礼的时候，我们也看到深刻地表现加米拉的思想感情的细节描写。当一个装满“经水”（念过经的水）、盖着白纸的瓷盌从加米拉手里跌碎在地上的时候，我们听到一个被囚的自由灵魂的绝叫！
    影片的不足之处是人物的个性不够凸出，哈森和加米拉在残酷斗争中的思想和性格的发展，不够鲜明。导演在追求镜头的简洁的时候，似乎在某种程度上忽视了电影剧本所包含的内容的丰满。影片的枝叶没有显出应有的繁茂，使洋溢在剧本中的诗意不能在银幕上取得充分的表现。但无论如何，导演和演员们的辛勤劳作已经取得了显著的收获。有些哈萨克族演员第一次出现在银幕上，便作出了这样的成绩，这是很值得重视的。（附图片）
    哈森从大牧主居奴斯家里把加米拉救了出来，两人逃到深山里去居住。
