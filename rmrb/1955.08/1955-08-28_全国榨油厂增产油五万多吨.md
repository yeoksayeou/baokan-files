    National Oil Mills Increase Oil Production by Over 50,000 Tons
    By the end of June, oil mills across the country had increased vegetable oil production by more than 50,000 tons. Among them, Jilin, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai, and Inner Mongolia had overfulfilled their increased production targets for the first half of the year. Currently, the oil industry workers in various regions are working with full confidence to complete the annual task of increasing vegetable oil production by 100,000 tons.
    In the first half of this year, most of the oil mills, without increasing raw materials, promoted Li Chuanjiang's advanced oil extraction experience or advanced experiences such as single-ring thin cakes and thin grass-free cake rings, and launched labor competitions with the promotion of advanced experience to improve oil yield as the main content. In areas where advanced experience has been promoted, the oil yield of major oilseeds such as soybeans has approached or reached the target of increasing by one to two jin based on the original oil yield, as proposed at the National Oil Production Conference last year. In Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanghai, Guangdong, Fujian and other places, the average soybean oil yield in the first half of the year exceeded the original target of 12.6 percent, with the highest reaching 13.9 percent. The average peanut oil yield also exceeded the original target of 41.1 percent, with the highest reaching 44 percent. As a result, many regions have increased oil production. In the first half of the year, Jiaozhou Special District in Shandong Province produced 350,000 jin of oil for the country. Jilin, Jiangsu, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning and other places also organized inter-factory labor competitions. The workers in the oil extraction workshop of the Siping Oil and Wine Factory, where Li Chuanjiang is located, launched inter-factory production increase competitions with Jilin Province and many oil mills across the country. In the first half of the year, this workshop increased soybean oil production for the country by more than 31,000 jin, exceeding the increased production plan for the first half of the year by more than 900 jin. The average oil yield exceeded the national target by 0.11 percent. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    全国榨油厂增产油五万多吨
    全国各地榨油厂到六月底止已增产植物油五万多吨。其中吉林、辽宁、江苏、安徽、上海、内蒙古等地都超额完成了上半年的增产任务。目前，各地油脂工业职工正满怀信心地为完成全年增产十万吨植物油的任务而努力。
    今年上半年，大部分地区的榨油厂都在不增加原料的基础上，推广了李川江先进榨油经验或单圈薄饼、薄型无草饼圈等先进经验，并开展了以推广先进经验提高出油率为主要内容的劳动竞赛。在已经推广先进经验的地区，大豆等主要油料的出油率都已接近或达到了去年全国油脂生产会议上提出的在原来出油率的基础上，再提高一斤到两斤的指标。辽宁、黑龙江、江苏、山东、上海、广东、福建等地，上半年大豆的出油率平均都超过了百分之十二点六的原订指标，最高的已达到百分之十三点九。花生仁的出油率平均也超过了百分之四十一点一的原订指标，最高已达到百分之四十四。因而，许多地区都增加了油的产量，山东省胶州专区在上半年就为国家产了三十五万斤油。吉林、江苏、内蒙古、辽宁等地，还组织了厂际劳动竞赛。李川江所在的四平油酒制造厂制油车间的工人，和吉林省以及全国许多榨油厂展开了厂际的增产竞赛，这个车间在上半年给国家增产了三万一千多斤豆油，超过上半年增产计划九百多斤。出油率平均超过国家指标百分之零点一一。（据新华社讯）
