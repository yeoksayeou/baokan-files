    Diesel Filter at Friendship Farm
    Ding Luxu
    Before the tractors at the State-Run Friendship Farm begin work, they are driven to the oil tank to refuel directly. A diesel filter is installed in the middle of the rubber hose used for transferring oil to ensure the cleanliness of the fuel. This filter was manufactured based on suggestions from Soviet experts. The filter is shaped like a small round iron bucket, 30 centimeters in diameter and 50 centimeters long, with three layers of silk filtering cores inside. The diesel passes through the cores, filtering out any impurities before being poured directly into the locomotive fuel tank. Refueling in this way avoids contact with air and dust, ensuring the cleanliness of the fuel and reducing wear and tear on the machinery. Wang Yinbo, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Machinery Department at Friendship Farm, said, "This suggestion from Soviet experts allows us to save approximately 40,000 yuan in locomotive repair costs annually."
    The diesel filtering situation at other farms in Northeast China is quite different: "Filters" are set up in the main oil depot or work area, consisting of large wooden barrels five or six feet tall with one layer of blanket and three layers of silk installed inside. More than a month before the start of each work season, special personnel are assigned to filter the diesel in advance, which is then loaded into barrels and transported to production teams for use. Although the freshly filtered diesel is indeed very clean, the process of loading and unloading the barrels dirties the clean oil again, ultimately failing to maintain fuel cleanliness and reduce machine wear.
    There is an even more serious problem: Many farms in Northeast China sow wheat in early spring. The diesel used for wheat sowing needs to be filtered in February and March. At that time, the local temperature is still minus 20 or 30 degrees Celsius, and the diesel congeals due to freezing. The oil must first be heated with fire before it can be filtered. As you can imagine, heating oil with fire is an extremely dangerous task! If Friendship Farm's type of filter were adopted, the locomotive could refuel directly from the oil tank at planting time. This would not only ensure the cleanliness of the fuel but also avoid the danger of heating oil with fire.

    友谊农场的柴油过滤器
    丁履枢
    国营友谊农场的拖拉机开始作业以前，都开到油罐跟前，直接从油罐里加油。在输油的胶皮管中间，装有一个柴油过滤器，保证油料的清洁。这个过滤器是根据苏联专家的建议制造的。过滤器的外形像一个小圆铁桶，直径三十公分，长五十公分，中间装有三层丝绢制成的过滤芯子，柴油通过芯子，滤净了夹杂物之后，直接灌到机车油箱里。这样加油，不接触空气，不见灰尘，能够保证油料清洁，使机器少受磨损。友谊农场机务副总工程师王荫波说：“苏联专家这一项建议，使我们一年大约可以节省四万多元的机车修理费。”
    东北其他农场的柴油过滤却是另外一种情形：在总油库或作业区设有“过滤器”，那是一个五、六尺高的大木桶，中间装置一层毯子、三层丝绢。每个作业季节开始前一个多月就抽调专人把柴油预先过滤好，然后装桶运到生产队去准备应用。刚刚滤过的柴油的确很清洁，但经过装桶、倒桶，就把净油又弄脏了，结果仍然不能保持油料清洁，减少机器磨损。
    还有一个更严重的问题：东北许多农场都是早春播种小麦。麦播时用的柴油，在二、三月里就要过滤。当时当地的温度还在零下二、三十度，柴油因冻凝结，要先用火把油烤化才能过滤。可以想像，用火烤油是一件多么危险的事！如果采用友谊农场的这种过滤器，到播种时机车直接从油罐加油，这不但可以保证油料清洁，还可以避免用火烤油的危险。
