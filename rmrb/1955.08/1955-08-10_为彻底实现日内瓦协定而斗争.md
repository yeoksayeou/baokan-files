The accords signed in Geneva on July 20, 1954, ended the heroic resistance of the Vietnamese people, marking a great victory for the Vietnamese military and people in the cause of national liberation, and a major victory for the cause of defending peace worldwide. Like Laos and Cambodia, Vietnam restored peace on the basis that France recognized Vietnam's national rights, French forces withdrew from Vietnam, and Vietnam held general elections to achieve national unification.

To struggle for the implementation of the Geneva Accords and the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference is a very important task for the Vietnamese people in the past year and more, and will continue to be a very important task throughout the period until free general elections are held and Vietnam's national unification is achieved.

On July 22, 1954, President Ho Chi Minh called on all the people to thoroughly respect and implement the provisions of the Geneva Accords:

"We are determined to faithfully implement the agreements we have signed with the French government, and at the same time, we demand that the French government also faithfully implement the agreements it has signed with us."

The entire military and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have overcome all difficulties to implement President Ho's instructions and thoroughly implement the Geneva Accords. When the Geneva Accords were concluded, although the Vietnamese People's Army had won successive victories on all battlefields throughout the country, we still overcame all obstacles, strictly carried out the ceasefire order according to the prescribed time, disengaged from intertwined positions, and withdrew our troops to the designated temporary regrouping areas. The Vietnamese People's Army in the southern garrison areas completed its mission of regrouping to the north ahead of schedule. Vietnamese volunteer forces in Cambodia and Laos also withdrew to their country within the prescribed time limit.

In the work of taking over cities and towns in northern Vietnam, the Vietnamese People's Army had to fight to prevent the other side from sabotaging and transferring public property, while restoring social order. In addition to the countryside, the Vietnamese People's Army took over eighteen towns, including Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Haiphong, the largest seaport in northern Vietnam. By May 16, 1955, northern Vietnam was completely liberated. The work of troop transfer to the north was completed. The completion of this task proved the determination of the military and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to strictly implement the Geneva Accords.

Regarding the issue of prisoners of war and detained civilians, despite many violations of the agreement by the other side—for example, the International Commission discovered that many prisoners of war and political prisoners detained on Con Dao Island and in Zhihe and other prisons had not been fully returned—the Vietnamese People's Army still strictly fulfilled the agreement it signed. The Vietnamese People's Army returned 13,414 prisoners to the French Union forces, including 54 officers from major to major general, 530 officers from second lieutenant to captain, and 3,523 non-commissioned officers.

The Vietnamese People's Army has never discriminated against individuals and groups who cooperated with the other side during the war. On the contrary, we still guarantee their various democratic freedoms. Currently, in Hanoi and Haiphong alone, more than 10,000 (or 62 percent) of the original employees of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime who remained in the north have been retained in their original positions and with their original salaries.

Regarding the clause on freedom to choose a place of residence, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has conducted extensive and in-depth publicity among the people through newspapers, radio broadcasts, and organized study sessions. The government provides those who want to go to the south with the necessary assistance to facilitate them. In order to guarantee that every Vietnamese citizen still has the right to freely travel between the south and the north outside the 300-day period stipulated in the Geneva Accords, on February 4, 1955, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam proposed to the responsible authorities in the south regarding the re-establishment of normal relations between the two regions. While waiting for a response from the southern authorities, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam announced a special decision to extend the deadline for those who wanted to go to the south by one month, and then extended it again by another month, that is, until July 20, 1955.

In short, over the past year, the military and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in accordance with the policy of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, have thoroughly respected and strictly implemented the Geneva Accords.

How has the French Union forces implemented the Geneva Accords?

Regarding the various clauses related to the armistice, generally speaking, the General Command of the French Union forces in Indochina has made efforts to implement the ceasefire, regrouping and transfer of troops, and handover of localities, although there have been violations of the agreement on specific issues.

However, the French Union forces have committed many serious violations of some important clauses of the Geneva Accords, which were stipulated to prevent the recurrence of war. The Geneva Accords stipulate: "Each party shall ensure that the areas assigned to them do not participate in any military alliance and that these areas shall not be used to re-ignite hostilities or for the exploitation of aggressive policies." This agreement is also clearly stipulated in the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference.

However, more than a month after the signing of the Geneva Accords, the French government participated in the Manila Conference and, together with the United States, Britain, and other countries, established the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which is inconsistent with the spirit of the Geneva Conference, and included South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos in the area "protected" by this treaty. As announced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, this is a blatant violation of the Geneva Accords, infringing on the independence and sovereignty of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and threatening peace and security in Southeast Asia. Through this treaty, certain foreign countries are increasingly interfering in the situation in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.

The Geneva Accords clearly stipulate: "Each party guarantees that no person or group shall be subjected to any retaliation or discrimination for their activities during the war, and guarantees their democratic freedoms." However, the Ngo Dinh Diem regime openly arrests, imprisons, and kills people who participated in or supported the resistance war in the past, who have resumed normal life since the ceasefire. According to incomplete statistics, by the beginning of May 1955, there were more than 3,000 incidents violating democratic freedoms in the southern provinces, and thousands of people were killed, and tens of thousands were arrested and injured in many terrorist or retaliatory incidents. They even brutally suppressed the movements in Saigon, Cholon, and Hue that demanded peaceful reunification of the motherland, and arrested and imprisoned personnel from the refugee relief organizations involved in the Saigon and Cholon bloodshed incidents they created.

In order to realize the conspiracy to undermine the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, the Ngo Dinh Diem regime also forced people from northern Vietnam to move to the south. This forced behavior was carried out with the connivance of the General Command of the French Union forces. They used military pressure to carry out threats, encirclements, and arrests, used religion to bewilder, and used propaganda to deceive and intimidate, forcing people to move to the south.

In the south, they obstructed those who wanted to move to the north and those who had been forced to move south but now recognized the truth and wanted to return to the north. These actions seriously violated the clause in the Geneva Accords regarding the people's right to freely choose their place of residence within 300 days.

On May 16, 1955, the completion of the regrouping and transfer of troops in the northern and southern regions of the temporary military demarcation line marked the end of an important stage in the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam and the beginning of another new stage. In the stage of implementing the various political clauses, the main task is to convene consultative conferences to discuss the issue of holding general elections for the unification of all Vietnam. On June 6, 1955, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement, preparing to hold a consultative conference with the responsible authorities in South Vietnam on July 20, 1955, to discuss the issue of holding free general elections throughout the country in July 1956.

This statement was welcomed by the people of the whole country. Despite Ngo Dinh Diem's implementation of fascist suppression policies, the people of Saigon and Cholon still marched, demonstrated, went on strike, and closed markets, demanding that the southern authorities negotiate with the north. The people of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries, peace-loving people all over the world, especially the French people, the Helsinki World Peace Conference, and the Lausanne World Mothers' Conference all supported this just struggle of the Vietnamese people. Marshal Bulganin, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Prime Minister Nehru all expressed their demand for respect for the Geneva Accords. The British Foreign Secretary also announced that the agreement must be implemented.

Contrary to the efforts made by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Ngo Dinh Diem regime violated the people's desire for peace and the desire for the reunification of the motherland, and continued to conspire to undermine peaceful reunification, attempting to permanently divide Vietnam and turn South Vietnam into a US military base. Their newspapers and radio stations constantly and openly propagated against the Geneva Accords and against the activities of the International Commission. At the same time, they continued to implement terrorist suppression policies, carried out brutal retaliation against those who had participated in the resistance war in the past, and launched the so-called "anti-communist" movement. They vainly hoped to conquer the Vietnamese people's firm will to struggle for peaceful reunification through terrorist suppression policies and distorted propaganda. In the statement of July 16, 1955, the Ngo Dinh Diem regime still chanted the same old tune, saying that it "did not sign the Geneva Accords and is not bound by it." Its purpose is to escape the responsibility of being the successor to the duties of the French Union forces. They also talked about "peace" and "unification" in words, but they opposed the Geneva Accords signed for the restoration and maintenance of peace in Indochina. Consultation is the only way to achieve national unification through general elections, but they are also unwilling to talk about this issue. After Ngo Dinh Diem's statement, they attacked the International Commission and launched various conspiracies to openly undermine international law.

Although the French government signed the Geneva Accords, it has not yet determined a clear attitude and has revealed an attempt to evade responsibility. On June 8, 1955, at the Central Joint Armistice Commission, the delegation of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army proposed to arrange a meeting and consultation between representatives of the responsible authorities of both sides. The representative of the General Command of the French Union forces announced that he did not have this responsibility and that France only had the same responsibility as the other eight countries that participated in the Geneva Conference on this issue. They even cancelled what they had just agreed to in the joint statement issued by the Central Joint Armistice Commission on May 17, 1955: Both sides are determined to continue to shoulder the responsibility of thoroughly implementing the provisions in the Geneva Accords and the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference; respect and thoroughly implement the clauses and provisions of this agreement in order to consolidate peace and realize the unification of Vietnam through general elections.

As pointed out in the joint statement by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Prime Minister of India on June 22, 1955: The further realization of the Geneva Accords is now under some threat of being undermined due to some new events that have suddenly occurred. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly issued notes proposing to convene consultative conferences, but has not yet received a clear response from the other party. Therefore, the consultative conference has not yet begun to this day. This attitude is clearly not commensurate with the sincere attitude of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, violates the wishes of the Vietnamese people, and violates the clauses of the Geneva Accords.

When will the consultative conference be convened to prepare for general elections to unify the entire country of Vietnam?

This is a question raised by the 23 million Vietnamese people who are eager for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, especially the people living under the terror rule of Ngo Dinh Diem in the south. This is also a question raised by fraternal countries, the French people, the fighters engaged in the peace and democracy movement, and all those who are concerned about the situation in Indochina.

The struggle to consolidate peace, realize unification, and complete independence and democracy will inevitably encounter many difficulties due to the obstruction of those who undermine peaceful reunification. However, under the glorious banner of President Ho Chi Minh and under the wise leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnamese people firmly believe that this struggle will surely be victorious, just as the long and arduous resistance war in the past has been victorious. Those saboteurs who violate the Vietnamese people's desire for peaceful reunification will undoubtedly suffer a heavy defeat.

    为彻底实现日内瓦协定而斗争
    越南中央联合停战委员会
    越南人民军总司令部代表团首席代表  文进勇少将
    一九五四年七月二十日在日内瓦签订的协定，结束了越南人民的英勇抗战，同时标志着越南军民在民族解放事业中的伟大胜利，标志着全世界保卫和平事业的重大胜利。和老挝、柬埔寨一样，越南在下述的基础上恢复了和平：法国承认越南的民族权利，法军撤离越南；越南进行普选，实现全国统一。
    为实现日内瓦协定和日内瓦会议最后宣言而斗争。这是越南人民在过去一年多时期中的一项非常重要的任务，也是今后直到进行自由普选、实现越南全国统一的整个时期的一项非常重要的任务。
    一九五四年七月二十二日，胡志明主席号召全体人民，彻底尊重和履行日内瓦协定的各项条款：
    “我们决心忠实履行我们和法国政府签订的协定，同时，我们要求法国政府也忠实履行它和我们签订的协定。”
    越南民主共和国的全体军民已经克服了一切困难，实现胡主席的指示，彻底履行日内瓦协定。当日内瓦协定缔结的时候，虽然越南人民军在全国各战场接连获得胜利，但我们仍然克服了一切阻碍，按照规定的时刻，严格执行停火的命令，摆脱犬牙交错的局面，把军队撤退到规定的临时集结区。南方各驻扎区的越南人民军提前完成了向北集结的任务。在柬埔寨和老挝的越南志愿部队，也都按照规定的期限撤退回国。
     在接管越南北方各城市和乡镇的工作中，越南人民军必须一面进行斗争，防止对方阴谋破坏和转移公共财产，一面恢复社会秩序。除了农村之外，越南人民军接管了十八个城镇，其中包括越南民主共和国的首都河内，以及越南北方最大的海港海防。到一九五五年五月十六日，越南北方已完全解放。部队向北转移的工作已完成。这一任务的完成，证明了越南民主共和国军民严格履行日内瓦协定的决心。
    关于俘虏和被拘平民问题，尽管对方有许多违反协定的行为，——例如国际委员会曾发现被扣留在昆仑岛以及志和等监狱的许多俘虏和政治犯还没有全部交回——越南人民军仍严格地履行它所签订的协定。越南人民军交还法兰西联邦部队方面一万三千四百一十四名俘虏，其中包括五十四名从少校到少将的军官，五百三十名从少尉到大尉的军官，三千五百二十三名下级士官。
    对于那些在战时和对方有过合作的个人和团体，越南人民军从来没有歧视他们，相反的，我们仍然保证他们的各种民主自由权利。现在，仅河内和海防就有一万名以上（即百分之六十二）留在北方的原属吴庭艳政权的职工人员被原职原薪留用。
    关于自由选择居住地区的条款，越南民主共和国政府已通过报刊、广播、组织学习……等方法在人民中进行广泛而深入的宣传。政府给予想到南方去的人以必要的帮助使他们获得各种方便。为了保证每一个越南公民在日内瓦协定所规定的三百天期限之外仍有自由来往于南方和北方之间的权利，一九五五年二月四日，越南民主共和国政府向南方有代表性的负责当局提出关于重新建立两个地区间的正常关系问题。在等待南方当局答复的期间，越南民主共和国政府宣布了一项特别决定，给想到南方的人延长一个月的期限，后来又再延期一个月，即延期到一九五五年七月二十日。
    总之，过去一年，越南民主共和国军民遵照越南民主共和国政府的政策，彻底尊重并严格履行日内瓦协定。
    法兰西联邦部队方面执行日内瓦协定的情况如何呢？
    属于停战的各项条款，一般地说，印度支那法兰西联邦部队总司令部已经努力执行停火、集结和转移部队、移交地方等项，虽然对于各项具体问题仍有违反协定的。
    但是对于日内瓦协定为防止战争再起而订的一些重要条款，法兰西联邦部队方面有许多严重违反协定的行为。日内瓦协定规定：“双方应注意使划归它们的地区不参加任何军事同盟并使这些地区不得用来重新引起敌对行动或供侵略政策利用。”这一协议在日内瓦会议最后宣言中也有明确规定。
    但在日内瓦协定签订一个多月之后，法国政府就参加了马尼拉会议，和美英等国家成立了同日内瓦会议的精神不符的东南亚条约集团，并且把越南南方和柬埔寨、老挝列入这个条约所“保护”的区域。正如越南民主共和国政府外交部所宣布的，这是露骨地违反日内瓦协定的行为，侵犯了越南、柬埔寨和老挝的独立主权，威胁了东南亚的和平与安全。借着这个条约，某些外国日益加甚地干涉越南、柬埔寨和老挝的局势。
    日内瓦协定明确规定：“每方保证不得对任何人和团体因其在战时的活动而加以任何报复与歧视，并保证他们的民主自由。”但吴庭艳政权却公然逮捕、监禁和杀害过去曾参加或拥护抗战的人，这些人是自从停火以后就已经恢复正常生活了的。据不完全的统计，到一九五五年五月初，在南方各省，有三千多件违反民主自由权利的事件，在许多次恐怖或报复事件中，有数千人被杀害，有数万人被逮捕和受伤。他们甚至残暴地镇压西贡、堤岸和顺化的要求祖国和平统一的运动，逮捕和监禁他们所制造的西贡、堤岸流血事件中的难民救济团体的人员。
    为了实现破坏越南和平统一的阴谋，吴庭艳政权还强迫越南北方人民移居到南方去，这种强迫行为是在法兰西联邦部队总司令部的纵容下进行的。他们用军事压力实行威胁、围捕，用宗教来迷惑，用宣传来欺骗恐吓，强迫人民移居到南方去。
     在南方，他们阻挠那些想移居到北方的人和那些曾被迫南移而现在认识了事实真相想回到北方的人们。这些行动严重地违反了日内瓦协定所规定的关于在三百天内人民有权自由选择居住地区的条款。
    一九五五年五月十六日，在临时军事分界线南北地区部队集结转移的完成，结束了在越南执行日内瓦协定的一个重要阶段，开始另一个新的阶段。在实现各项政治条款的阶段中，主要是召开协商会议，讨论为统一全越南而举行普选问题。一九五五年六月六日，越南民主共和国政府发表声明，准备在一九五五年七月二十日和越南南方有代表性的负责当局举行协商会议，讨论将在一九五六年七月全国举行自由普选的问题。
    这一声明获得全国人民的欢迎。尽管吴庭艳实行法西斯镇压政策，西贡、堤岸的人民仍然游行示威、罢工、罢市、要求南方当局和北方进行协商。苏联、中国和各兄弟国家的人民，全世界爱好和平的人民、特别是法国人民，赫尔辛基世界和平大会和洛桑世界母亲大会都支持越南人民的这一正义斗争。布尔加宁元帅、周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理都表示要求尊重日内瓦协定。英国外长也宣布必须执行协定。
    同越南民主共和国政府所作的努力相反，吴庭艳政权违反人民要求和平，要求祖国统一的热望，继续阴谋破坏和平统一，企图永远分裂越南，把越南南方变成美国的军事基地。他们的报刊和广播电台不断地公开宣传反对日内瓦协定，反对国际委员会的活动，同时，他们仍继续实行恐怖镇压政策，对那些过去参加过抗战的人实行残暴的报复，发动了所谓“反共”运动。他们妄想借着恐怖镇压政策和歪曲的宣传来征服越南人民为和平统一而斗争的坚决意志。吴庭艳政权在一九五五年七月十六日的声明中，仍然喊着那一套陈腐的论调，说它“没有在日内瓦协定上签字，不受它的约束”。它的目的是为了逃避作为法兰西联邦部队的职务的继承者的责任。他们口头上也谈“和平”“统一”，但他们反对为恢复和维护印度支那和平而签订的日内瓦协定。协商是为了进行普选达到统一全国的唯一办法，但他们也不愿意谈这个问题。在吴庭艳的声明之后，他们对国际委员会行凶，发动公然破坏国际公法的种种阴谋。
    法国政府虽然在日内瓦协定上签了字，但直到现在还没有确定明确的态度，而表露出企图逃避责任。一九五五年六月八日，在中央联合停战委员会上，越南人民军总司令部代表团提出，准备安排由双方有代表性当局的代表们会面协商。法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表却宣布，他没有这个责任，对于这个问题，法国只负有和参加日内瓦会议的其他八个国家相同的责任。他们甚至取消了他们刚刚同意的一九五五年五月十七日中央联合停战委员会发表的联合声明所宣布的话：双方决心继续担负彻底履行日内瓦协定和日内瓦会议最后宣言中的规定的责任；尊重和彻底执行这个协定的条款和规定，以巩固和平和通过普选实现越南的统一。
    正如苏联部长会议主席和印度总理在一九五五年六月二十二日的共同声明中所指出的：日内瓦协定的进一步实现，现在由于突然发生的一些新事件而有受到破坏的某种威胁。越南民主共和国政府已经再发出照会，提议召开协商会议，但仍未获得对方明确的答复，因此，协商会议直到今天还没有开始。这种态度显然和越南民主共和国的诚恳态度不能相称，违反越南人民的愿望，并且违反日内瓦协定的条款。
    什么时候才召开协商会议准备进行普选来统一越南全国？
    这是越南二千三百万切望祖国和平统一的人民所提出的问题，特别是生活在南方吴庭艳恐怖统治下的人民所提出的问题。这也是各兄弟国家、法国人民、从事和平民主运动的战士们以及所有关心印度支那情况的人们所提出的问题。
    为巩固和平、实现统一、完成独立和民主的斗争，必然由于和平统一的破坏者的阻挠而遭到许多困难，但是，在胡志明主席的光辉的旗帜下，在越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的英明领导下，越南人民坚信这一斗争必然胜利，正如过去的长期和艰苦的抗战已经获得胜利一样。那些违反越南人民的和平统一愿望的破坏者，无疑地将会遭到惨重的失败。
