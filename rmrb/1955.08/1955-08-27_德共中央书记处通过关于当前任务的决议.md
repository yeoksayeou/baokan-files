　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 25th: According to TASS, the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) held a meeting in Düsseldorf on the 22nd. The First Secretary of the Central Committee, Max Reimann, spoke at the meeting, discussing the situation after the Geneva Conference and the upcoming Four Foreign Ministers Conference. After thorough discussion of this issue, the Secretariat decided on the tasks facing the Party after the Geneva Conference.
    The Secretariat passed a resolution, emphasizing that the Geneva Conference laid the foundation for international trust and peaceful coexistence among nations. The discussion of the German question at the Geneva Conference confirmed the repeated warnings of the German Communist Party: the ratification of the Paris Agreements would hinder and permanently prevent the peaceful reunification of Germany. It is impossible to guarantee security by including West Germany in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The resolution stated: The Soviet proposal for establishing an all-European collective security system is the path to obtaining security and realizing the peaceful reunification of Germany.
    The resolution then emphasized that the demands for ending the Cold War, guaranteeing security, reaching an understanding between Germans, reconciliation between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, and reunifying Germany according to democratic principles are in the interests of both the residents of West Germany and the entire German people. The resolution welcomed the statement of the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, and demanded that West German policy also be based on the desire to seek mutual understanding.
    The German Communist Party believes that the German workers' parties—the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the Social Democratic Party of Germany, and the German Communist Party—must reach an understanding on joint action. The resolution pointed out that the German Communist Party is prepared to cooperate without any preconditions with all Germans who recognize their responsibility.
    The resolution emphasized that as long as we unite, we will have enough strength to clear the path for security, mutual understanding, and the peaceful and democratic reunification of Germany.

　　德共中央书记处通过关于当前任务的决议
    新华社二十六日讯　据塔斯社柏林二十五日讯：德国共产党中央委员会书记处二十二日在杜赛尔多夫举行会议，中央委员会第一书记马克斯·雷曼在会上讲话，谈到日内瓦会议后的局势以及未来的四国外长会议。书记处在彻底讨论了这个问题后，决定了党在日内瓦会议后所面临的任务。
    书记处通过了一项决议，强调指出日内瓦会议为国际信任、为各国的和平共处奠定了基础。日内瓦会议关于德国问题的讨论证实了德国共产党一再提出的警告：巴黎协定的批准将妨碍并且长期地阻止德国的和平统一。把西德包括在北大西洋公约组织内来保证安全，是不可能的。决议说：苏联所提出的关于建立全欧集体安全体系的建议是获得安全和实现德国的和平统一的道路。
    决议接着强调指出，关于结束冷战、保证安全、达成德国人之间的谅解、联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国之间的修好以及按照民主方针重新统一德国的要求，是既符合西德居民的利益又符合整个德国人民的利益的。决议表示欢迎德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥的声明，并且要求西德的政策也以谋求互相谅解的意愿为基础。
    德国共产党认为德国的工人政党——德国统一社会党、德国社会民主党和德国共产党——必须就联合行动达成谅解。决议指出，德国共产党准备不附任何先决条件而同一切认识到他们的责任的德国人合作。
    决议着重指出，只要团结起来，我们就会有足够力量为安全、为互相谅解、为德国的和平和民主的重新统一扫清道路。
