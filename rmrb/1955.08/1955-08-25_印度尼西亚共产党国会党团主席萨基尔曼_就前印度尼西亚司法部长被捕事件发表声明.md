Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 24th: The Jakarta "People's Daily" published on August 22nd a statement made by Sakirman, Chairman of the Indonesian Communist Party Parliamentary Group, on August 21st regarding the arrest of former Minister of Justice Zodi Gondokusumo.

The statement said that the Indonesian Communist Party opposes corruption. However, it recognizes that "the root of corruption and the biggest obstacle to its eradication are the forces of foreign capitalism (primarily Dutch capitalists) and the bureaucracy of the government. In order to maintain their interests in Indonesia, Dutch colonialists and the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang bandit gang still have the freedom and sufficient funds to bribe upper-level Indonesian figures through crude or gentle, direct or indirect means."

The statement said that the Indonesian Communist Party would not rashly assume that Zodi Gondokusumo is justified, but one thing cannot be denied: "It is well known that Zodi, during his tenure as Minister of Justice, took resolute action against the Kuomintang subversive groups and reactionaries."

The statement questioned: Why was Zodi Gondokusumo, as a civilian, arrested by the military police instead of the regular police? Why was the arrest warrant signed by the military prosecutor? Why was the arrest carried out immediately after the entire Ali Sastroamidjojo cabinet resigned? Why are anti-corruption measures only targeting officials of the Ali Sastroamidjojo government? The statement said: "The Indonesian Communist Party also sees evidence proving that the current anti-corruption movement has certain special purposes, and aims to make the people forget their main enemies—Dutch colonialism, the Kuomintang bandit gang, and the subversive activities of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries."

The statement emphasized that the anti-corruption movement should be carried out in conjunction with anti-colonialist policies, must have honest intentions, and must employ honest methods.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 24th: According to Antara News Agency, the General Secretary of the Indonesian National People's Party, Danukusumo, visited Prime Minister Burhanuddin Harahap on the 23rd regarding the arrest of former Minister of Justice Zodi Gondokusumo. He informed Prime Minister Harahap that the Executive Committee of the National People's Party had decided to request the acceleration of the investigation into Zodi's case, and at the same time believed that Zodi should not be imprisoned. Zodi Gondokusumo is the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the National People's Party.

　　印度尼西亚共产党国会党团主席萨基尔曼
　　就前印度尼西亚司法部长被捕事件发表声明
    新华社雅加达二十四日电　雅加达“人民日报”二十二日刊载了印度尼西亚共产党国会党团主席萨基尔曼二十一日就前司法部长佐迪·龚多古苏莫被捕事件发表的声明。
    声明说，印度尼西亚共产党反对贪污。但是它认识到“贪污的根源和妨碍肃清的最大障碍是外国资本主义势力（最大的是荷兰资本家）和政府的官僚主义。为了要保持他们在印度尼西亚的利益，荷兰殖民主义者和蒋介石国民党匪帮仍然有自由，并且有足够的金钱，通过粗暴的或者温和的，直接的或者间接的方式，来贿赂印度尼西亚的上层分子。”
    声明说，印度尼西亚共产党将不轻率地认为佐迪·龚多古苏莫是有理的，但是有一件事是不能否认的，这就是：“人们都知道佐迪在司法部长任内曾经勇敢地对国民党颠覆集团和反动分子采取了坚决的行动。”
    声明提出质问说：作为平民的佐迪·龚多古苏莫，为什么不是由警察来逮捕而是由宪兵来逮捕？为什么逮捕令要由军事检察长签署？为什么刚巧在阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁全体辞职以后进行逮捕？为什么反贪污的措施仅仅针对阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约政府的官员？声明说：“印度尼西亚共产党还看出证据证明目前的反贪污运动有着某些特殊的目的，而要使人民忘掉他们的主要敌人——荷兰殖民主义、国民党匪帮和东南亚条约组织国家的颠覆活动。”
    声明强调指出，反贪污运动应当同反殖民主义政策一起进行，必须有老实的目的，并且采用老实的方法。
    新华社雅加达二十四日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚国家人民党总书记达努库苏莫在二十三日就前司法部长佐迪·龚多古苏莫被捕事件访问总理伯汉努丁·哈拉哈普。他通知哈拉哈普总理说，国家人民党执行委员会决定要求加速调查佐迪的案件，同时认为佐迪不应当被囚禁。佐迪·龚多古苏莫是国家人民党执行委员会主席。
