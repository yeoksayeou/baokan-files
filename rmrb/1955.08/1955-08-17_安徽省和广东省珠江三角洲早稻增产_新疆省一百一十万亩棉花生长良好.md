    Anhui Province and Guangdong Province Pearl River Delta Early Rice Production Increased
    Xinjiang Province 1.1 Million Mu of Cotton Growing Well
    Xinhua News Agency: Anhui Province has completed harvesting early rice on the 2.48 million mu of double-cropping rice fields converted this year. The average yield per mu is more than 400 jin, an increase of more than 50% compared to last year. Farmers are now rushing to transplant late rice seedlings, striving for another bumper harvest.

    Converting single-cropping rice to double-cropping rice is one of the three major reforms in agricultural production in Anhui Province. Last year, the 340,000 mu of double-cropping rice fields yielded an increase of more than 110 jin per mu compared to single-cropping rice, despite the extraordinary floods. This year, the area converted to double-cropping rice has expanded by six and a half times. At the same time, various localities have actively promoted advanced experiences such as appropriate close planting of rice, timely irrigation, and rational fertilization.

    To meet the irrigation needs of double-cropping rice, various localities have organized farmers to build many farmland water conservancy projects. This year, the state has also built 26 new pumping stations in areas converted to double-cropping rice, helping farmers expand the irrigated area by more than 300,000 mu. The state has supported farmers with a total of more than 54 million jin of improved early and late rice varieties.

    The more than 500,000 mu of double-cropping continuous cropping early rice converted in the Pearl River Delta's sandy fields this year has generally yielded more than the previously planted double-cropping intercropping early rice. The 370,000+ mu of continuous cropping early rice in Xinhui and Zhongshan counties can increase the average yield by about 100 jin per mu compared to last year's intercropping early rice. The 150,000+ mu of continuous cropping early rice in Panyu County has an average yield increase of 120 jin per mu compared to last year's intercropping early rice. After the conversion, many villages and towns also promoted technological reforms such as small-plant close planting and rational fertilization, resulting in some high-yield demonstration fields with yields of up to 750 jin or more per mu of continuous cropping early rice.

    The fertile sandy fields are alluvial layers of the Pearl River Delta. In the past, due to farmers' extensive cultivation and planting of double-cropping intercropping rice, the land's fertility could not be fully utilized. Therefore, the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee decided to mobilize farmers to transform sandy fields in a planned and large-scale manner and convert them to double-cropping continuous cropping rice to increase grain production. Last winter and this spring, local farmers actively transformed sandy fields under the leadership of the people's government. More than 500,000 mu of sandy fields have been filled with river mud, and another 40 million dan of native miscellaneous fertilizer have been added. To support farmers in converting to double-cropping continuous cropping rice, the Guangdong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative organized the supply of several thousand head of draught cattle. The Guangdong Provincial Department of Water Resources also invested more than 1 million yuan to build ten large-scale projects such as mechanical drainage stations, mobile pumping stations, and dikes, benefiting more than 190,000 mu of sandy fields.

    The 1.1 million mu of cotton in Xinjiang Province is growing well. Currently, the tens of thousands of mu of cotton in the Tarim Basin are generally 50 to 60 centimeters high, with some plants already having about 20 bolls and buds; the 117,000+ mu of cotton in the Turpan Basin has begun to produce fiber, and a bumper harvest is expected; according to the boll formation situation, the cotton in the Manas River basin is estimated to have a yield per mu exceeding any previous year.

    Currently, farmers are working intensively in the cotton fields, removing axillary buds, topping, and watering. Many agricultural production cooperatives in Korla County have also made bone meal, oil residue, and manure into top dressing to make the cotton bolls open early.

### 安徽省和广东省珠江三角洲早稻增产  新疆省一百一十万亩棉花生长良好

    安徽省和广东省珠江三角洲早稻增产
    新疆省一百一十万亩棉花生长良好
    安徽省今年改种的二百四十八万亩双季稻，早稻已收割完毕，每亩平均产量四百多斤，比去年增产五成以上。现在农民正在抢栽晚稻秧，争取再一次的丰收。
    把单季稻改种为双季稻，是安徽省农业生产三项改革的重要内容之一。去年改种的三十四万亩双季稻，在特大洪水情况下，每亩还比单季稻增产一百一十多斤。今年改种双季稻的面积就扩大了六倍半。同时，各地积极推行了水稻适当密植、适时灌溉、合理施肥等先进经验。
    为满足双季稻的灌溉需要，各地都组织农民兴修了很多农田水利工程。今年国家又在改种双季稻的地区新建二十六个抽水机站，帮助农民扩大了灌溉面积三十多万亩。国家支援农民的早稻和晚稻良种共达五千四百多万斤。（新华社）
    珠江三角洲沙田地区今年改种的五十多万亩双季连作早稻，普遍比过去种植的双季间作早稻增产。新会、中山两县三十七万多亩连作早稻，平均每亩可比去年间作早稻增产一百斤左右。番禺县十五万多亩连作早稻，平均每亩比去年间作早稻增产一百二十斤。不少乡村在改种后还推行了小株密植、合理施肥等技术改革，结果出现了一些高额丰产田，每亩连作早稻的产量高达七百五十斤以上。
    肥沃的沙田是珠江三角洲的冲积层，过去因农民耕作粗放，种植双季间作稻，不能充分利用地力。因此，广东省人民委员会决定有计划地和大规模地发动农民改造沙田，改种双季连作稻，以增产粮食。去冬今春，当地农民在人民政府领导下积极改造沙田。五十多万亩沙田都加进了河泥，另外还有土杂肥四千万担。为支援农民改种双季连作稻，广东省供销合作社组织供应了几千头耕牛。广东省水利厅也投资一百多万元兴修了机械排水站、流动抽水机站、堤围等大型工程十处，受益沙田十九万多亩。（新华社）
    新疆省一百一十万亩棉花生长良好。目前，塔里木盆地的几十万亩棉花一般高达五十到六十公分，有的每株已有蕾、铃二十个左右；吐鲁番盆地的十一万七千多亩棉花，已开始吐絮，丰收有望；玛纳斯河流域的棉花，依据结铃情况估计，每亩产量可超过已往任何一年。
    现在，农民们正在棉田中紧张地进行抹赘芽、打顶、浇水等工作。库尔勒县许多农业生产合作社为使棉铃早日吐絮，还把骨粉、油渣、厩肥制成追肥。（新华社）
