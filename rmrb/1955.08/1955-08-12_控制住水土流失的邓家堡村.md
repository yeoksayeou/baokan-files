Dengjiabao Village, on the south bank of the Wei River in Wushan County, Gansu Province, is a mountain village in the Loess Plateau region. More than three years ago, the village had poor harvests every year, and 23 of the 25 peasant households in the village did not have enough food. At that time, droughts and floods frequently struck the village. When rain was needed in the summer, it never came, and the crops withered in the fields. In the autumn, there were often heavy rains. When it rained heavily, sometimes the ground was washed "three clean" (soil clean, manure clean, seedling clean). At the same time, rainwater carried sediment down from the plateau and poured into the Wei River. The fields became steeper and thinner as they were eroded, the ravines on both sides of the village became wider and deeper, and the sediment in the Wei River became more and more.

But in the course of more than three years, the villagers have stopped the attacks of natural disasters, and Dengjiabao Village has changed. The farmers built ridges along the fields, and more than 2,000 mu of cultivated land in the village have formed neat terraces. In order to consolidate the terraces and control soil erosion, not only have trees and pasture grasses been planted in the four large ravines that traverse the village, but more than 300 stepped flood control dams have been built section by section from the bottom of the ravines to the top to prevent mountain floods from rushing down. In the low-lying areas around the village, many interconnected waterlogged ponds and water weirs have been dug to accumulate rainwater. At the same time, more than 110,000 locust, apricot, Chinese toon, walnut, and apple trees have been planted in the ravines and hillsides to the left and right of the terraces, and alfalfa and other pasture grasses have also been planted on the hillsides. Now many trees have grown to more than two meters high, and the pasture grass is lush green. Looking at the hillside from afar in the village, it is no longer as bare as it used to be, but a lush green.

The farmers of Dengjiabao Village told me that since 1952, they have been relying on mutual aid organizations to lead the farmers in doing this soil and water conservation work. At that time, the mutual aid group leaders often led their members to the mountains to build ridges, repair terraces, build dams at the bottom of the ravines, and repair water weirs. Later, the village established agricultural production cooperatives, and the farmers' enthusiasm for fighting against nature became even greater. After a series of struggles, the village's crop yields have increased year by year. Deng Madou, a 71-year-old farmer, had a piece of land that had not been planted with wheat for many years. In 1953, he built a ridge, and last year he planted wheat, and each mu yielded two stones, which is four times higher than the average wheat yield in the area. The average yield of crops per mu in the whole village increased by 30 jin in 1953 compared to 1952, and increased by another 30 jin in 1954 compared to 1953. Although wheat in this area generally suffered from pests this year, the average yield of Dengjiabao Village is still 41 percent higher than it was three years ago. Of the 25 peasant households in Dengjiabao Village, 20 achieved sufficient food and clothing last year, and it is expected that two-thirds of the households will have surplus grain after the autumn harvest this year.

After the news that Vice Premier of the State Council Deng Zihui made a "Report on the Comprehensive Plan for Radically Controlling the Yellow River Floods and Developing the Yellow River Water Conservancy" at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress reached Dengjiabao Village, the farmers were all overjoyed. They said that they would strive to complete the plan for 800 mu of field projects ahead of schedule this autumn.

    控制住水土流失的邓家堡村
    新华社记者　马玉平
    甘肃省武山县渭河南岸的邓家堡村，是黄土高原地区的一个山村。三年多以前，村里每年收成都很坏，全村二十五户农民就有二十三户农民粮食不够吃。那时旱灾、水灾经常袭击这个村庄，夏季需要雨的时候，偏偏不下雨，庄稼干死在地里；到了秋季，却常常下暴雨。在下暴雨的时候，有时地上被雨水冲成“三光”（土光、粪光、苗光），同时雨水夹带泥沙从高原奔腾而下倾泻到渭河。田地愈冲刷就愈陡愈瘦，村庄两旁的几条沟壑也就愈宽愈深，而渭河的积沙就愈来愈多。
    但在三年多的过程中，村里农民制止了自然灾害的袭击，邓家堡村已经变样了。农民们在田边筑起地埂，全村二千多亩耕地已形成一块一块整齐的梯田。为了巩固梯田、控制水土不致流失，横亘在村庄两侧的四条大沟壑中，不但种植了树木和牧草，从沟底到沟顶，逐段筑成三百多个阶梯形的拦洪土坝，阻止山洪下泻。在村庄周围低洼的地方，挖了许多连环涝池和水堰，积蓄雨水。同时在梯田左右的沟壑和山坡上，又栽植了十一万多株洋槐、杏、椿、核桃和苹果等树木，山坡上还种了草木樨等牧草。现在不少树木已长到二公尺多高，牧草油绿，从村里远远望去，山坡已不是过去那样光秃，而是一片葱绿。
    邓家堡村农民告诉我说，从一九五二年起，他们是依靠互助组织带动农民做好这一水土保持工作的。那时，互助组组长经常带领组员们上山培地埂，修梯田，到沟底筑坝和修水堰。以后村里成立了农业生产合作社，农民们同自然作斗争的劲头更大了。经过一系列的斗争，这个村的农作物产量逐年提高。七十一岁的农民邓麻豆，有一块地多年不种麦子了，一九五三年培起地埂，去年种上小麦，每亩竟收获两石，比当地一般小麦产量高出四倍。全村农作物每亩平均产量，一九五三年比一九五二年增加三十斤，一九五四年又比一九五三年增加三十斤。今年这一带小麦虽然普遍遭受虫害，但邓家堡村平均产量还比三年前的产量高出百分之四十一。邓家堡村的二十五户农民，去年有二十户达到丰衣足食，预计今年秋收后将有三分之二的户都有余粮。
    当国务院副总理邓子恢在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上作了“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”的消息传到了邓家堡村以后，农民们个个欢欣鼓舞。他们表示，今年秋天要争取提前完成八百亩田间工程的计划。
