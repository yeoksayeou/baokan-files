Xinhua News Agency, August 11th – Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China Regarding the South Korean Authorities' Attempt to Undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement Through Threatening Actions.

On August 1, 1955, the South Korean authorities openly announced their readiness to seize the area north of the Military Demarcation Line and south of the 38th parallel, and demanded that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission withdraw from South Korea. On August 5, the South Korean authorities formally notified the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, limiting the time for all personnel of the commission stationed in South Korea to withdraw completely no later than 24:00 on August 13, 1955. This is a serious action attempting to directly undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement, and the countries concerned should not ignore it.

The South Korean Syngman Rhee group has consistently been hostile to the Korean armistice, openly advocating the resumption of the Korean War, and has repeatedly brought the Korean armistice to the brink of danger. Currently, thanks to the efforts of all parties concerned, the situation in the Far East has shown a certain degree of relaxation. The actions that the Syngman Rhee group is threatening to take are precisely a conspiracy by certain forces in the international community to undermine this situation. If it is not stopped, it will bring extremely serious consequences.

The Government of the People's Republic of China believes that any attempt to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement and threaten the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is unacceptable. The United States, as the representative of the United Nations Command in signing the armistice agreement, bears an unshirkable responsibility to immediately take effective measures in accordance with the relevant provisions of the armistice agreement to stop the threatening actions of the Syngman Rhee group, and to ensure the due security and work of all institutions and personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission stationed in South Korea. The governments of the countries concerned on the United Nations Command side have a responsibility to ensure that the United Nations Command earnestly fulfills its international obligations under the armistice agreement.

Consolidating the Korean armistice and further seeking the peaceful unification of Korea is a necessary factor in easing tensions in the Far East.

Although the 1954 Geneva Conference failed to reach an agreement on the peaceful unification of Korea, the Chinese side has continued to strive to consolidate the Korean armistice and strive for the peaceful unification of Korea. We have consistently advocated that all foreign troops should withdraw from Korea, and that the countries concerned should guarantee the peaceful development of Korea, so that the Korean people can peacefully resolve the issue of Korean unification. Contrary to the slanders of some people, the Chinese People's Volunteers are ready to withdraw from Korea at any time simultaneously with all other foreign troops. We have reason to demand that certain countries no longer insist on keeping foreign troops in Korea.

We believe that the Korean armistice must be consolidated and not allowed to be undermined by anyone. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission must be respected by both sides of the armistice and not allowed to be threatened by anyone. The countries concerned should hold a Far East conference with the broad participation of Asian countries to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    对南朝鲜当局企图直接破坏朝鲜停战协定
    我国外交部发表声明
    新华社十一日讯　中华人民共和国外交部关于南朝鲜当局企图以威胁行动破坏朝鲜停战协定的声明。
    一九五五年八月一日南朝鲜当局公开宣布准备夺取军事分界线以北、三八线以南的地区，并要求朝鲜中立国监察委员会撤出南朝鲜。八月五日，南朝鲜当局正式通知中立国监察委员会，限该委员会驻在南朝鲜的人员不迟于一九五五年八月十三日二十四时全部撤走。这是一个企图直接破坏朝鲜停战协定的严重行动，有关各国不应置之不理。
    南朝鲜李承晚集团一贯敌视朝鲜停战，公开鼓吹恢复朝鲜战争，并曾多次使朝鲜停战濒于危殆。目前由于有关各方的努力，远东局势出现了一定程度的和缓。李承晚集团威胁着要采取的行动，正是国际上某些势力企图破坏这种形势的一个阴谋，如果不加以制止，必将带来极其严重的后果。
    中华人民共和国政府认为，任何企图破坏朝鲜停战协定、威胁中立国监察委员会的行为都是不能容许的。代表联合国军在停战协定上签字的美国负有不可推卸的责任，根据停战协定的有关规定，立即采取有效措施，制止李承晚集团的威胁行动，并使驻在南朝鲜的中立国监察委员会的一切机构和人员的安全和工作得到应有的保障。联合国军方面有关各国政府都有责任使联合国军切实履行它在停战协定中所承担的国际义务。
    巩固朝鲜停战，并进一步谋求朝鲜的和平统一，是和缓远东紧张局势的一个必要因素。
    一九五四年日内瓦会议虽然没有能对朝鲜的和平统一达成协议，但中国方面仍然不断为巩固朝鲜停战和争取和平统一朝鲜而努力。我们一贯主张一切外国军队应该撤出朝鲜，有关国家应该保证朝鲜的和平发展，以便朝鲜人民能够和平解决朝鲜的统一问题。与某些人的诬蔑相反，中国人民志愿军准备在任何时候与一切其他外国军队同时撤出朝鲜。我们有理由要求某些国家不再坚持把外国军队留在朝鲜。
    我们认为，朝鲜停战状态必须巩固，不容许任何人加以破坏。中立国监察委员会必须受到停战双方的尊重，不容许任何人加以威胁。有关国家应该举行一次有亚洲国家广泛参加的远东会议，来谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决。
  一九五五年八月十一日
