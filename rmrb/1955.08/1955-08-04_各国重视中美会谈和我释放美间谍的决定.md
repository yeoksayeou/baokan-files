Countries Value Sino-US Talks and My Decision to Release US Spies

    Indian Representative to the United Nations, Menon
    Before departing Geneva by plane for New Delhi on the 2nd, the Indian Representative to the United Nations, Menon, said at the airport that there was no reason why the Sino-US sides should not reach an agreement on the repatriation of civilians to their respective countries, and he believed that the talks had no reason not to make progress.
    When asked to comment on China's decision to release eleven American airmen ahead of schedule, he said, "This is what we expected, and it will improve relations." He said that this action created a favorable atmosphere for the progress of the negotiations.

    Japanese Public Leader, Ikuo Oyama
    According to reports from Hong Kong's "Ta Kung Pao" and "Wen Wei Po" on the 2nd: Japanese public leader Ikuo Oyama, who attended the World Peace Conference and was invited to visit China, made a statement to reporters on the 1st while passing through Hong Kong on his way back home.
    Ikuo Oyama expressed his welcome to the Sino-US ambassadorial talks being held in Geneva, saying, "I hope that this meeting will lead to a better future, and that after the problems are resolved in this meeting, it will lead to another higher-level meeting. I hope that the issue of China's liberation of Taiwan will be resolved in accordance with the principles of non-interference in internal affairs and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty in the Five Principles."
    Ikuo Oyama pointed out: "If all countries in the world adopt the Five Principles, international disputes can be resolved, and relations between countries can be normalized."
    Ikuo Oyama said: "Many countries believe that a conference of the five major powers with China's participation should be held. Without China's participation, major world issues, especially Far Eastern issues, cannot be completely resolved." He said: "We advocate that China's seat in the United Nations should be restored quickly."

    Indian Newspapers
    The "Indian Express" published an editorial on the 3rd on the Sino-US ambassadorial talks and China's early release of eleven American spies, saying: The scope of the Sino-US Geneva talks must be expanded, because the actions taken by China have created an atmosphere for such expansion.
    The editorial supported Premier Zhou Enlai's statement that the issue of the Chinese people liberating Taiwan is China's internal affair, and advocated that the liberation of Taiwan should be decided by the Chinese themselves, because "this is the only way to maintain peace in East Asia and the Pacific." The editorial concluded: "It is now up to the United States to show the wisdom and courage required by the situation."
    The "Indian Times" published an editorial on the 3rd welcoming the decision to release eleven American spies ahead of schedule. The editorial said that this decision will help advance the current Geneva negotiations, "which, if successful, will pave the way for a more formal and potentially more representative conference on East Asian issues."

    Indonesian Newspapers
    The Sino-US ambassadorial talks have been headline news in most newspapers in Jakarta for the past few days. These newspapers prominently published Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress on July 30, and they pointed out in the headlines: China sincerely desires peace and has put forward specific plans to achieve peace in the Pacific region.
    The "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 2nd stating that the Sino-US talks themselves prove that no international dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation. The newspaper said that Premier Zhou Enlai's speech was extremely important. The newspaper expressed its belief that Taiwan and other Far Eastern issues can be resolved peacefully.

    American Newspapers
    American newspapers continue to widely comment on the Sino-US talks that have begun in Geneva and the decision by the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China to release eleven American spies ahead of schedule.
    Many newspapers welcomed this decision, considering it a sign of "sincerity" and a step towards further easing international tensions. These newspapers believe that the issue of repatriation of civilians in both countries will be quickly resolved in the Geneva talks, and that both sides will move on to discuss other practical issues existing between China and the United States.
    The "New York Times" said that the decision of the Supreme People's Court "is a contribution to easing tensions."
    "New York Herald Tribune" observer Lawrence wrote that the move to release eleven Americans "opens the way for broader negotiations" on Far Eastern issues. Lawrence said that due to the amicability shown by the Chinese side, "world opinion forces the US government to listen to arguments on all Far Eastern issues."
    Washington "News" reporter Denny pointed out that both sides in the Sino-US talks in Geneva hope to solve the problem. The reporter said that in Europe, "the American policy of refusing to diplomatically recognize China" and refusing to give China a seat in the United Nations "is rarely understood, and even fewer people support this policy."
    At the same time, newspapers reflecting the views of those who are unwilling to ease tensions in the Far East continue to launch various attacks on the People's Republic of China.

    British Newspapers
    On the 2nd, London newspapers prominently published the news that the Supreme People's Court of China had decided to release eleven American spies ahead of schedule, and the comments and articles published by the newspapers all welcomed this decision.
      The "News Chronicle" published an article commenting on this news under a banner headline. The headline pointed out that "China Opens the Way for Peace Talks, American Pilots Released Before Meeting of Two Ambassadors." The "News Chronicle" said in an editorial published on the same day: Due to this measure taken by China, "the Sino-US talks in Geneva got off to a good start yesterday before they even began."
    An article published by the "Daily Express" said that China's statement has greatly eased tensions in the Far East as a result.
    The "Daily Mirror" published an article by a reporter under the banner headline "The World Gets More Good News" saying: "China's performance gives the talks between the Sino-US representatives a good start."
    The "Daily Herald" published an editorial entitled "Good News" saying: "Actions to end the world's most dangerous tensions began yesterday." The editorial said when talking about the Sino-US ambassadorial talks: "If everything goes smoothly, this may enable the foreign ministers of the United States and China to reach further understanding on issues that threaten peace." The editorial also said: "The United States' formal dealings with China show that the United States recognizes China's strength and importance. This should finally lead to the step of China being admitted to the United Nations – which is what Britain hopes for."
    An editorial in the "Daily Mail" pointed out, "The welcome prospects have suddenly strengthened."

    French Newspapers
    On the 2nd, French newspapers published comments on the ambassadorial talks between China and the United States and the decision by the Supreme People's Court of China to release eleven American spies ahead of schedule.
    "Le Figaro" wrote: "The Sino-US talks are starting under the best omens." The newspaper said that the decision of the Supreme People's Court of China "makes it possible to make very good predictions for future work."
    "Liberation" believes: Some people have spared no effort to emphasize that "Beijing is not sincere" in recent days, which is just "malicious speculation."
    "L'Humanité" pointed out in its commentary on the decision to release eleven American spies ahead of schedule: The government of the People's Republic of China is determined not to ignore any opportunity that is conducive to easing the situation.

    各国重视中美会谈和我释放美间谍的决定
    印度驻联合国代表梅农
    印度驻联合国代表梅农在二日乘飞机离日内瓦赴新德里之前在机场上说，中美双方没有理由不应当就遣返双方平民回国这件事达成协议，他认为会谈没有理由不获得进展。
    有人请他就中国决定提前释放十一名美国飞行人员一事发表意见，他说：“这是我们所期望的，这将使关系得到改善”。他说，这一行动为谈判的进展创造了有利的气氛。
    日本公众领袖大山郁夫
    据香港“大公报”、“文汇报”二日报道：曾出席世界和平大会并应邀访问了中国的日本公众领袖大山郁夫一日在回国途经香港时，对记者发表了谈话。
    大山郁夫表示欢迎正在日内瓦举行的中美两国大使级会谈，他说：“我希望这次会谈会导致更好的将来，在这次会谈问题解决之后导致另一次更高级的会议。我希望按照五项原则中互不干涉内政和互相尊重领土主权的原则，来解决中国解放台湾的问题。”
    大山郁夫指出：“如果世界各国都采纳五项原则，国际间的纠纷将可获得解决，各国间的关系也可正常化。”
    大山郁夫说：“许多国家都认为应该举行一个有中国参加的五大国会议。没有中国的参加不能完满解决世界重大问题，尤其是远东问题。”他说：“我们主张中国在联合国的席位应该迅速恢复。”
    印度报纸
    “印度快报”三日就中美两国大使级会谈和中国提前释放十一名美国间谍一事发表社论说：中美日内瓦会谈的范围必须扩大，因为中国所采取的行动已经为这种扩大创造了气氛。
    社论支持周恩来总理关于中国人民解放台湾问题是中国内政问题的说法，并且主张台湾的解放应该由中国人自己来决定，因为“这是保持东亚和太平洋的和平的唯一办法”。社论最后说：“现在要由美国来表示局势所要求的明智和勇气了。”
    “印度时报”三日发表社论欢迎关于提前释放十一名美国间谍的决定。社论说，这个决定将有助于推进目前的日内瓦谈判，“这个谈判如果成功，就将为更正式的和可能更具有代表性的关于东亚问题的会议铺平道路。”
    印度尼西亚报纸
    中美两国间的大使级会谈在过去几天里一直是雅加达的大多数报纸的头条新闻。这些报纸以显著地位刊载了周恩来总理七月三十日在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言，它们在标题中指出：中国热诚地渴望和平并且提出了实现太平洋地区的和平的具体计划。
    “人民日报”二日发表社论说，中美会谈本身证明了没有任何国际争端是不能够通过谈判来加以解决的。这家报纸说，周恩来总理的发言是极端重要的。报纸表示相信台湾和其他远东问题是可以用和平方式来解决的。
    美国报纸
    美国报纸继续广泛评论已经在日内瓦开始的中美会谈和中华人民共和国最高人民法院关于提前释放十一名美国间谍的决定。
    许多报纸欢迎这一决定，认为这是“诚意”的表示，是谋求进一步缓和国际紧张局势的步骤。这些报纸认为，在日内瓦会谈中，双方平民回国问题将获得迅速的解决，并且双方将转入讨论中美之间现有的其他实际问题。
    “纽约时报”说，最高人民法院的决定“是对缓和紧张局势的一个贡献。”
    “纽约先驱论坛报”观察员劳伦斯写道，释放十一名美国人的举动，在远东问题上“打开了更广泛的谈判的道路”。劳伦斯说，由于中国方面表现的和睦，“世界的舆论使美国政府不得不倾听在一切远东问题上的论据。”
    华盛顿“新闻报”记者德尼指出，在日内瓦的中美会谈中，双方都希望解决问题。记者说，在欧洲，“美国所实行的拒绝在外交上承认中国”和拒绝给中国在联合国的席位的“政策很少得到人们的了解，支持这种政策的人就更少。”
    同时，反映了那些一点也不愿意缓和远东紧张局势的人们的观点的报纸，继续对中华人民共和国进行种种的攻击。
    英国报纸
    二日伦敦报纸以显著地位刊载了中国最高人民法院决定提前释放十一名美国间谍的消息，各报发表的评论和文章一致欢迎这个决定。
      “新闻纪事报”用通栏标题刊载了评述这个消息的一篇文章。标题中指出“中国开辟了和平谈判的道路，美国飞行员在两国大使会面以前获释”。“新闻纪事报”在同日发表的社论中说：由于中国采取这一措施，“日内瓦的中美谈判昨天在开始以前就获得一个好的开端”。
    “每日快报”发表的文章说，中国的声明已使远东紧张局势因此大大缓和下来。
    “每日镜报”在“世界又得到了一个好消息”的通栏标题下面刊载了记者的一篇文章说：“中国的表现给予中美代表的会谈一个良好的开端。”
    “每日先驱报”以“好消息”为题发表社论说：“结束世界上最危险的紧张局势的行动昨天开始了。”社论在谈到中美两国大使级会谈时说：“如果一切进行顺利，这可能使美国和中国的外交部长在威胁和平问题上取得进一步的谅解。”社论又说：“美国同中国正式打交道，说明美国认识到中国的力量和重要性这个事实。这应该最后导致中国被接纳进联合国的步骤——这是英国所希望的。”
    “每日邮报”的社论指出，“可喜的前景突然加强了。”
    法国报纸
    法国报纸二日就中美两国举行的大使级会谈和中国最高人民法院决定提前释放十一名美国间谍一事发表评论。
    “费加罗报”写道：“中美会谈是在最良好的征兆之下开始的。”报纸说，中国最高人民法院的决定“使人大可以对今后的工作作很好的预测”。
    “解放报”认为：这几天来有人不惜强调指出“北京不怀诚意”，这只是“恶意的猜测”。
    “人道报”在评论关于提前释放十一名美国间谍的决定时指出：中华人民共和国政府是决心不忽视任何对缓和局势有利的机会的。
