Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 19th: The Indian Press Trust reported on the brutal massacre of Indian volunteers by Portuguese authorities in Goa on the 15th.

The report said that Portuguese troops were lying in ambush in advance in the Kasirlock area on the Goa border, waiting to shoot unarmed Indian volunteers. The report said that initially 48 volunteers planned to enter Goa from this area. Later, another 200 volunteers joined them and advanced in two groups. The first group of 58 people were beaten by Portuguese police and expelled. The second group entered the border through a railway tunnel. Portuguese soldiers waited until everyone was in the middle of the tunnel before suddenly opening fire on them. When the volunteers tried to run back with the wounded, Portuguese soldiers also strafed them with Sten guns and Bren guns. As a result, a total of fifteen volunteers were killed.

The "Statesman" reported on the 17th that many people witnessed that the Portuguese authorities in Banda fired on Indian volunteers who were still twenty yards away from the border, wounding a woman and killing two people who went to help the injured female volunteer.

    葡萄牙当局残酷屠杀印度志愿人员经过
    新华社新德里十九日电　印度报业托辣斯报道了果阿葡萄牙当局十五日残酷屠杀印度志愿人员的情况。
    消息说，葡萄牙军队预先在果阿边境卡斯尔洛克地方埋伏着，等待射击手无寸铁的印度志愿人员。消息说，最初有四十八名志愿人员计划从这个地区进入果阿。后来又有二百名志愿人员和他们会合在一起，分成两批前进。第一批的五十八人遭到葡萄牙警察的毒打而被逐出。第二批是通过一条铁路隧道进入边界的。葡萄牙士兵等到他们所有人到了隧道的中间时突然向他们开枪。当志愿人员试图带着受伤的人一起跑回去时，葡萄牙士兵还用司登式冲锋枪和白伦枪向他们扫射。结果共有十五名志愿人员被打死。
    “政治家报”十七日报道，许多人亲眼看到，在班达地方的葡萄牙当局曾开枪射击离开边界还有二十码远的印度志愿人员，打伤一名妇女，并且打死两名去帮助这位受伤的女志愿人员的人。
