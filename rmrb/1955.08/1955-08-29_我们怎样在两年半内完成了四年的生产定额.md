　　How We Completed Four Years of Production Quota in Two and a Half Years
　　Zhu Weiqin, Zhang Liande, Outstanding Young Lathe Operators of Dalian Shipbuilding Company

    The great First Five-Year Plan has been approved by the Second Session of the National People's Congress. This is a plan to create happiness for the people of the whole country and for future generations, and it encourages each of us to make the greatest efforts to realize it. In order to guarantee the early realization of the Five-Year Plan, we have set a plan to complete eight years of production quota in five years. In the past two and a half years, we have completed four years of production quota.

    The two of us came to Dalian Shipbuilding Company together in August 1948 to learn the same lathe technology. Half a year later, we both graduated from our apprenticeships and were able to independently operate machines for production. Soon after, we were assigned to work on the same lathe.

    The production nature of our factory is very complex, with many varieties and different specifications, making batch production impossible. Often, what we do in the morning is not the same as what we do in the afternoon. Therefore, we deeply feel that strengthening unity and mutual assistance among lathe workers, creating conditions for each other on and off shifts, helping each other, and exchanging production experiences in a timely manner are important guarantees for completing the state plan. Therefore, when the two of us hand over shifts, we make sure that the outgoing shift always thinks about what difficulties the next shift might encounter. If we see that any tools are missing or that any cutters need to be changed, we actively help prepare them so that the next shift can make full use of production time. During shift handover, we also exchange production experiences and introduce the methods we have come up with in production to the next shift. This not only saves a lot of time but also promotes the improvement of each of our technical levels. Once, when Zhu Weiqin was machining a Wallow bearing seat, he researched the use of a three-edged cutter to save three procedures and increase production efficiency by more than one time. When Zhang Liande took over the shift, Zhu Weiqin introduced this method, and as a result, the two of them increased production efficiency by more than one time.

    In the production process, we also deeply realized the great significance of saving every minute to ensure the completion of the production task. At first, we didn't pay much attention to saving time, thinking that finding a trick or making a fixture would solve everything. Later, the Party Branch gave us a small book called "The Value of Time in Industrial Production," which wrote: "...Saving every minute and every second of work time is of great significance...In the Soviet Union, in 1952, approximately fifty tons of pig iron, seventy tons of steel, and fifty-four tons of steel products were produced every minute, and six hundred tons of coal and ninety-four tons of oil were extracted..." This gave us great inspiration. In our production time, it is divided into two parts: the first part is production time, which is the contact time between the cutter and the workpiece; the second part is the time for preparatory work for production, which is auxiliary time. The auxiliary time used by our mechanical workers is very long, sometimes exceeding production time. Therefore, we paid attention to saving auxiliary time. We did this in saving time:

    First, we do a good job of preparing for production in advance, first of all, preparing the cutters and measuring tools. Every day when we go to and from work, we check the usage of the cutters, prepare the cutters in advance by modifying them, brazing them, and grinding them, and also collect new ones in advance if they need to be collected. The cutters all have fixed positions, and we can reach for the cutter we need, which reduces the auxiliary time for preparing cutters in production. For example, when working on Kava work, we arrange the four drill bits, one reamer, one template, and one caliper needed for the work neatly on the lathe bed. Various wrenches also have a fixed position. This not only avoids the phenomenon of collision and damage to the cutters but also greatly saves non-production time in production. In addition, we pay great attention to protecting the cutters. If we need a certain shape of cutter, we will definitely use that shape of cutter and never try to make do with whatever is available. We never borrow commonly used cutters from others, and we also pay attention to whether there is cast iron debris or unevenness on the workpiece when using them. This greatly reduces the consumption of cutters. We are allocated twelve cutters per month, but we only need to collect seven or eight, and one magnetic steel cutter has been used for nearly six years. We have never been affected by cutters for even a minute of production.

    Second, we have mastered the work rules of the management personnel, become familiar with the drawings in advance, prepare the work, and ask about any technical problems and things we don't understand in a timely manner. In our factory, the section chiefs, planners, and dispatchers hold a dispatch meeting every day from 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., and the section chiefs also hold a liaison meeting every two days. Before these people hold meetings, we must actively contact them, tell them in advance when the work will be completed, what problems there are, and when they will be resolved, to avoid problems during work that cannot be resolved or cause downtime. Once, when we were about to finish the work on the lathe, we went to the planner to ask for work. The planner said, "A batch of Kava plate pliers are waiting for installation by the factory, and the work is very urgent. The leadership has decided that you will do it!" When we heard this, we knew that this work was very troublesome. It takes six procedures to machine a small hole, and the productivity is very low, so we asked the technician to help us find a solution. The technician made a fixture and a square rod drill bit store. Using this tool, each Kava plate was faster by five minutes, and as a result, the task was completed ahead of schedule.

    We also pay attention to saving every minute in various operating actions. For example, shaking the tool holder and pushing the tip, because the lathe is old, it is very tiring to do, so we try to make the tip closer to the workpiece, and push it up as soon as the work falls, so that we can save one or two minutes. These methods have helped us to make fuller use of production time.

    The leadership often educates us, saying: "Tapping the potential of equipment is a reliable guarantee for completing production tasks." In production, we often feel that the lathe is not strong enough. When the cutting depth reaches four millimeters, the lathe will whine and not move, and we have to stop and reduce the cutting depth again. Some people say: "It's an old lathe, it doesn't have much potential, it's just like this." At first, we also thought so, feeling that old lathes have no potential. However, when processing larger workpieces in production, it is really troublesome and time-consuming to machine them one cut at a time. We should be able to do five, but we can only do three, which makes us anxious again. We all feel that if we continue like this, we will not be able to keep up with the needs of production development and will not be able to complete the production quota. Therefore, we studied how to solve this problem. Once, during a shift handover, we turned the lathe to the highest speed (300 revolutions) and increased the cutting depth from one millimeter upwards. When it reached three millimeters, the lathe made a very heavy whining sound. We hardened our hearts and increased it to four and a half millimeters. At this time, the lathe stopped with a "whine." We opened the motor box and saw that the motor was pulling the belt and idling there, which made us feel strange. Why doesn't the lathe move, but the motor is dragging the belt and idling? At this time, we suddenly remembered that the potential is here, because the motor still has the power to drive the machine tool to rotate. The problem lies in the belt. We studied increasing the pulley by fifty millimeters and increasing the number of belts from four to six to increase the driving force. The result of this test was that the lathe speed increased from 300 revolutions per minute to 400 revolutions per minute, and the cutting depth increased from 4 millimeters to about 7 or 8 millimeters, which increased production efficiency by more than 40%. This played a decisive role in our monthly overfulfillment of production tasks.

    After reading Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy," we were extremely happy. We know that the task before us is glorious and arduous, and we are determined to overfulfill the state plan more and guarantee the realization of the First Five-Year Plan.

　　我们怎样在两年半内完成了四年的生产定额
　　大连造船公司优秀青年车工　朱维勤　张连德
    伟大的第一个五年计划已由全国人民代表大会第二次会议通过了。这是为全国人民、为子孙万代创造幸福的计划，它鼓舞我们每个人为实现它而作最大的努力。为了保证五年计划的提前实现，我们订出了五年完成八年生产定额的计划。在过去的两年半时间里，我们已完成了四年的生产定额。
    我们两个人是在一九四八年八月一同到大连造船公司学习同样的车床技术的。半年之后，我们两个人都出了徒，能独立操纵机器进行生产了。不久，又被分配在一台床子上干活。
    我们工厂的生产性质是很复杂的，品种多，规格要求不一，不能成批生产，经常午前、午后干的不是一样活。所以我们深深地感到加强同床工人之间的团结互助，上下班互相创造条件，互相帮助，及时交流生产中的经验是完成国家计划的重要保证。因此我们两个人在交接班时就做到：干上一班的在交班前，总要为下一班想想有什么困难，要是看见少什么工具或需要改什么刀具，就主动帮助准备好，使下一班能够充分利用生产时间；交班时，要交代得详详细细，直到觉得一切都没有问题了，才回去休息。在交接班时，我们还互相交流生产中的经验，把自己在生产中想出的方法介绍给下一班。这样做不但能节省很多时间，也促进了我们每个人技术水平的提高。有一次朱维勤在车瓦罗座子时，研究出用三刃刀具车节省了三道手续，提高了生产效率一倍多，张连德接班时，朱维勤就介绍了这个办法，结果两个人提高了生产效率一倍多。
    我们在生产过程中，还深深体会到节约每一分钟对保证完成生产任务的重大意义。起先，我们是不大注意节约时间的，认为找个窍门、做个胎具就什么都有了。后来党总支给了我们一本“时间在工业生产中的价值”小书，书里写道：“……节约每分钟、每秒钟的工作时间都有重大的意义……在苏联，一九五二年每分钟生产了约五十吨生铁、七十吨钢、五十四吨钢材，开采了六百吨煤、九十四吨石油……”这给了我们很大的启示。在我们的生产时间里，分为两部分：第一部分是生产时间，也就是刀具和工作物的接触时间；第二部分是为了生产而进行准备工作的时间，也就是辅助时间。我们机械工人用的辅助时间很长，有时候要超过生产时间。因此我们就注意节约辅助时间。我们在节约时间上是这样做的：
    第一，提前做好生产中的准备工作，首先是做好刀具和量具的准备工作。每天上下班我们都检查一下刀具的使用情况，提前把刀具改好、沾好、磨好，应该领取新的也提前领取。刀具都有固定的位置，用什么刀，伸手就能拿到，减少了生产中准备刀具的辅助时间。比如干卡瓦活，我们就把干活需用的四个钻头，一个掏眼刀，一个样板，一个卡钳都有条有理地排在床子板上。各种搬子也有一定的位置。这不仅避免了互相冲撞损坏刀具的现象，也大大节省了生产中的非生产时间。另外，我们很注意爱护刀具，需要什么形状的刀，我们就一定用什么形状的刀，决不胡乱凑付；常用的刀决不去借别人的，用的时候也注意活上是不是有生铁末子或不圆的地方。这样就大大降低了刀具的消耗量，每月规定给十二把刀具，我们只领七、八把就行了，有一把磁钢刀用了将近六年。我们从没有因为刀具影响过一分钟生产。
    第二，我们掌握了管理人员的工作规律，提前熟悉图纸，准备活，有什么技术问题和不明白的地方及时打听。在我们工厂里的工段长、计划员同调度员每天午前十一点到十二点开调度会，工段长还两天开一次联系会。在这些人开会之前，我们必须同他们主动联系，提前告诉活什么时候完，有什么问题，什么时候给解决，以避免在干活时出了问题找不着人解决或造成停工。有一次我们快要干完床子上的活，就去向计划员要活。计划员说：“有一批卡瓦片钳工厂等安装用，活很紧急，领导上决定你们干！”我们一听，知道这活非常挠头，车一个小眼就得六道手续，生产率很低，因此就找技术员帮助想办法。技术员给做了一个胎具和方杆钻头库。我们使用这个工具，每个卡瓦片快了五分钟，结果提前完成了任务。
    我们还注意在各种操作动作中节约每一分钟。比如摇刀把，推顶尖，因为床子旧，干起来很累人，我们就尽量使顶尖离工作物近一些，落下活马上就能推上，这样就能节省一两分钟的时间。这些办法都帮助我们能更充分地利用生产时间。
    领导上经常教育我们说：“挖掘设备潜力是完成生产任务的可靠保证。”我们在生产中常常感到床子力气不足，吃刀量达到四公厘时床子就呜呜地光叫唤不动弹，还得停车再减低吃刀量。有人说：“老床子啦，没有多大油水，就这样了。”起初，我们也这样想，感到破床子不会有什么潜力。可是在生产中一加工较大的活，一刀一刀地车真费事、费时，应该干五个的，只能干三个，又使我们着急起来了，都觉得老这样下去，会跟不上生产发展的需要，不能完成生产定额。因此，我们就研究如何解决这个问题，有一次，在交接班时我们就把车开到最高的回转速（三百转），吃刀量由一公厘往上增加，到三公厘时，床子就发出很沉重的呜呜声。我们又狠了狠心，加到四个半公厘，这时床子就“呜”地一声停了下来。我们打开电动机箱子一看，电动机拉着皮带在那直空转，就感到奇怪。为什么床子不动，而电动机拖着皮带空转呢？这时，我们突然想起来了，潜力就在这里，因为电动机还有力量来带动机床转。问题就在皮带上。我们研究把皮带轮加大了五十公厘，又由过去的四根皮带增加到六根，以增加带动力。这样试验的结果，车床子回转速度由过去每分钟三百转增加到四百转，吃刀量由过去吃四公厘增加到七八公厘左右，使生产效率提高百分之四十以上。这对我们月月超额完成生产任务起了决定性的作用。
    看了李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”后，我们高兴极了。我们知道摆在我们面前的任务是光荣而艰巨的，我们决心更多地超额完成国家计划，保证第一个五年计划的实现。
