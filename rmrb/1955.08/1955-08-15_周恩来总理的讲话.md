Your Excellency Ambassador, Ladies and Gentlemen:
    Today is the eighth anniversary of Pakistan's independence. On behalf of the Chinese Government and people, I extend warm congratulations to the Pakistani Government and people.
    In recent years, economic and cultural ties between China and Pakistan have been increasingly strengthened. In particular, the mutual visits of various delegations between the two countries in the past year have further promoted mutual understanding.
    In April this year, the Asian-African Conference was held in Bandung. As Your Excellency Ambassador just pointed out, this conference had a far-reaching impact and made contributions to peace and international understanding. The resolutions of the conference run through the common aspirations of the Asian and African peoples to strive for and maintain independence and freedom, safeguard world peace, and promote friendly cooperation. Our government and people are willing to work with Pakistan and other Asian and African countries to continue to implement the agreements of the Asian-African Conference.
    The success of the Asian-African Conference is largely due to the initiative and efforts of the five Colombo countries: Pakistan, India, Burma, Indonesia, and Ceylon. I believe that Pakistan will join the other four Colombo countries in making greater contributions to friendship and cooperation between Asian and African countries.
    The Prime Ministers of China and Pakistan had the opportunity to hold frank and sincere talks during the Asian-African Conference. This contact between government officials of the two countries has greatly helped mutual understanding and friendship between the two countries.
    As Your Excellency Ambassador just said, since the independence of Pakistan and the founding of the People's Republic of China, the two countries have established and continuously developed new good-neighborly and friendly relations on the basis of ancient and traditional friendship. I am deeply convinced that in the future the good-neighborly relations between our two countries will be increasingly enhanced, and the cultural and economic exchanges between our two countries will become more frequent.
    Your Excellency Ambassador, Ladies and Gentlemen, I propose a toast to the prosperity of Pakistan, the prosperity of the people, the friendly cooperation between China and Pakistan, the peace of Asia and the whole world, and the health of His Excellency Iskander Mirza, Acting Governor-General of Pakistan!

    周恩来总理的讲话大使阁下，女士们和先生们：
    今天是巴基斯坦独立八周年纪念日，我代表中国政府和人民向巴基斯坦政府和人民致热烈的祝贺。
    几年来，中巴两国之间的经济和文化联系已日益加强。特别是最近一年以来，两国之间各种代表团的相互访问，进一步促进了彼此的了解。
    今年四月间，在万隆举行了亚非会议。诚如大使阁下刚才所指出的，这个会议起了深远的影响，对和平和国际谅解作出了贡献。会议的各项决议贯串着亚非各国人民争取和维护独立自由、保障世界和平、促进友好合作的共同愿望。我国政府和人民愿意同巴基斯坦和其他亚非国家一起，为贯彻亚非会议的各项协议而继续努力。
    亚非会议的成就，在很大的程度上是由于巴基斯坦同印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和锡兰五个科伦坡国家的倡议和努力。我相信，巴基斯坦将会同其他四个科伦坡国家一起，为亚非国家之间的友好和合作作出更大的贡献。
    中巴两国总理曾有机会在亚非会议期间进行坦白和诚恳的会谈。两国政府负责人员之间的这种接触，大大有助于两国间的相互了解和友谊。
    正如大使阁下刚才所说的，自从巴基斯坦独立和中华人民共和国成立以来，两国在古老和传统的友谊基础上，建立了并不断地发展着新的睦邻友好关系。我深信，今后我们两国之间的睦邻关系将日益增进，我们两国的文化和经济来往将更加频繁。
    大使阁下，女士们和先生们，我提议为巴基斯坦国家的兴盛、人民的繁荣，为中巴两国的友好合作，为亚洲和全世界的和平，为巴基斯坦代理总督伊斯坎德尔·米尔扎阁下的健康而干杯！
