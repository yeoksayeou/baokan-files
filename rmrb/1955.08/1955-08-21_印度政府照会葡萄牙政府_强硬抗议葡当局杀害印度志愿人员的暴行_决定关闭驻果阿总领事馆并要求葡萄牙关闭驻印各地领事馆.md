    新华社新德里二十日电　据印度政府发表的新闻公报说，印度政府在十八日通过印度驻果阿总领事送给葡萄牙政府驻果阿总督的一个照会中宣布，印度决定关闭它在果阿的总领事馆，并且要求葡萄牙在九月一日或这一天以前关闭它在孟买的总领事馆，以及在加尔各答和马德拉斯的名誉领事馆。
    照会谴责葡萄牙政府在十五日杀害印度志愿人员的暴行。照会说，“印度政府愿以最强硬的措词向葡萄牙政府指出，葡萄牙当局在这件事上的行动是和文明政府的惯例完全相反的，而且是对没有武装的人民不分清红皂白地和残酷地使用武力。”
    德里报纸指出，由于印度政府的这个决定，印葡两国的外交关系将完全断绝。印度驻里斯本公使馆已经在一九五三年七月关闭。葡萄牙驻新德里公使馆也在今年八月八日关闭了。
