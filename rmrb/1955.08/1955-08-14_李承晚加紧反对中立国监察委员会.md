Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch: As the "deadline" for Syngman Rhee's clamoring for the "withdrawal" of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission approaches, the Syngman Rhee clique's threatening actions are intensifying.

The atmosphere on Wolmi Island, the location of the Incheon inspection team, remains very tense. Thugs continue to blockade the causeway leading to the island, and many more are surrounding the island by boat from the water. They display reactionary slogans on their boats and blatantly approach the headquarters of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on the island, creating a nocturnal uproar and using loudspeakers to demand the withdrawal of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. At Gangneung port on the east coast, thugs attempted to break into the inspection team's residence again on the afternoon of the 12th. On the morning of the 13th, another demonstration against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission was held in Seoul, where the Syngman Rhee government is located.

News from Washington indicates that the United States still maintains an attitude of indulgence and support towards the provocative actions of the Syngman Rhee clique. According to a report by the United Press, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson and Syngman Rhee's ambassador to the United States, Liang Youchang, held talks at the U.S. State Department on the 12th. Robertson reiterated the U.S.'s "sympathy," which U.S. Secretary of State Dulles had expressed to the Syngman Rhee clique. Robertson told Liang Youchang that the United States was "striving" to find a "peaceful way" to dissolve the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Robertson also assured that the United States would try to make the Polish and Czechoslovakian members of the commission leave South Korea. In Seoul, Syngman Rhee revealed to American reporters that as early as July of last year, when he visited Washington, Dulles had already assured him that he would definitely make the "communist armistice inspection personnel" leave South Korea. At that time, Dulles and Syngman Rhee had discussed this issue with the participation of U.S. President Eisenhower and Stassen, among others.

    李承晚加紧反对中立国监察委员会
    新华社十三日讯　随着李承晚叫嚣要中立国监察委员会“撤退”的“期限”的临近，李承晚集团的威胁行动又趋加紧。
    仁川视察小组的所在地月尾岛空气依然十分紧张。暴徒们继续封锁着通往岛上的堤道，另外还有许多暴徒乘船从水上来包围这个岛屿。他们在船上张着反动标语，他们明目张胆地驶近岛上中立国视察小组的总部，通宵叫闹不休，并且利用扩音器喊叫要中立国监察委员会撤退。在东海岸的江陵口岸，暴徒在十二日下午曾再次企图攻入视察小组的驻地。十三日上午，李承晚政府所在地的汉城，也再一次举行了反对中立国监察委员会的示威。
    从华盛顿传来的消息表明美国对于李承晚集团的挑衅行动，迄今仍然采取放纵支持的态度。据合众社报道，美国助理国务卿罗伯逊和李承晚政府驻美国大使梁祐灿十二日在美国国务院举行了会谈。罗伯逊重申了美国国务卿杜勒斯对李承晚集团所表示过的美国的“同情”。罗伯逊告诉梁祐灿说，美国是在“极力设法”寻求一个“和平的办法”来解散中立国监察委员会。罗伯逊并且保证说：美国将设法使委员会中的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员离开南朝鲜。在汉城，李承晚向美国记者透露，早在去年七月间他访问华盛顿的时候，杜勒斯就已经向他保证过，他一定要使“共产党的停战视察人员”离开南朝鲜。当时，杜勒斯和李承晚曾在美国总统艾森豪威尔、史塔生等人的参加下讨论过这个问题。
