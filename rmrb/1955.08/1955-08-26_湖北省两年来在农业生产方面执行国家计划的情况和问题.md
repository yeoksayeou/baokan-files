Hubei Province's Implementation of National Plans in Agricultural Production and Problems Over the Past Two Years
Liu Zihou, Governor of Hubei Province

I. Basic Situation of Agricultural Production in the Past Two Years

    1953 was the first year of the First Five-Year Plan. In this year, the province's total grain output completed 104.5 percent of the plan, an increase of 7.22 percent compared to 1952; cotton production was reduced due to disasters, but also completed 91.64 percent of the plan, equivalent to 91.12 percent of 1952.
    In 1954, the province suffered an unprecedented catastrophic flood, but thanks to the concern of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, as well as the strong support from all parts of the country, we finally overcame the flood, reduced the disaster, and vigorously carried out a production self-salvation campaign, which prepared extremely favorable conditions for the restoration of production.
    This year's task is arduous. On one hand, we must restore production in the disaster areas, and on the other hand, the total output must also be increased.
    The total output of wheat this year is estimated at 1.79 billion catties, completing 104.9 percent of the plan. At present, the growth of rice seedlings is very good, and a good autumn harvest is expected. As long as we seize the work of flood prevention, drought resistance, and pest control, it is entirely possible to strive for overfulfilling the production increase plan.
    Based on the production situation in the past few years, the potential for agricultural increase is very large, but due to the limitations of various current conditions, the instability of harvests is a serious problem. Therefore, under the existing conditions, making every effort to overcome natural disasters and strive for stable annual increases in production has become the urgent demand of the people of the whole province.

II. Understanding the Key to Agricultural Increase

    Experience has proved that Hubei Province must grasp the following key points in order to complete the agricultural increase plan.
      (1) Vigorously develop agricultural production cooperatives. Over the past two years, Hubei Province has vigorously carried out the mutual aid and cooperation movement in accordance with the policy of "active leadership and steady progress." As of the spring of 1955, the organized farmers accounted for 66.79 percent of the total number of farmers in the province. Among them, agricultural production cooperatives have developed to 14,250, with more than 300,500 participating households. Compared with individual farmers in production, mutual aid and cooperation organizations have significant advantages, and agricultural cooperatives are more significant and prominent. According to statistics from thirteen agricultural production cooperatives in ten counties including Xiaogan and Xiangyang: in 1954, the unit yield of grain crops (rice) in agricultural production cooperatives was more than 28 percent higher than the unit yield of local individual farmers; 23.29 percent higher than the unit yield of local temporary mutual aid teams; and 15.64 percent higher than the unit yield of local year-round mutual aid teams. At the same time, various localities used various forms of leadership methods for mutual aid and cooperation networks, leading groups with cooperatives, and cooperatives and groups with individual farmers, which effectively promoted the entire agricultural production movement.
    Practice has fully proved that the development of the existing primary forms of agricultural production cooperatives is not only a necessary step to guide farmers to socialism, but also a method of agricultural increase that requires less investment, yields great results, and yields quick results.
    Of course, there are still many problems in agricultural production cooperatives, such as mutual benefit issues and production management issues. But as long as we pay attention to solving them, these problems can be solved.
    In the past two years, thanks to the healthy development of the cooperativization movement and the correct implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, the vast number of farmers have increasingly tended toward socialism and actively demanded to join agricultural production cooperatives.
    According to the instructions of the Party Central Committee, the Provincial Party Committee plans to develop agricultural production cooperatives to 45,000 in 1955, and the number of cooperative households will account for about 16 percent of the total number of farmers; it is planned that by the autumn of 1957, the number of cooperative households will account for about 35 percent of the total number of farmers. We believe that as long as the leadership grasps tightly, it is possible to complete this task. In order to achieve this task, the Provincial Party Committee decided to transfer nearly 14,000 outstanding staff members from the province to enrich and strengthen grass-roots organizations, form a strong team to run cooperatives, strengthen specific leadership over the cooperativization movement, and further implement the "three fix" policy to promote the further development of the agricultural production movement.
    (2) Harnessing water conservancy and overcoming water and drought disasters. Hubei Province is both afraid of water and afraid of drought, especially afraid of floods. Therefore, harnessing water conservancy and gradually controlling and overcoming water and drought disasters is one of the most prominent and critical links in agricultural increase. In order to ensure the Jingjiang Dam and protect the lives and property of millions of people, the state built the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area. It has obviously played a significant role in last year's flood control.
    However, until the comprehensive treatment plan for Jianghan is fully realized, consolidating the dykes is still an arduous task that must be completed every year.
    In 1953, the province completed a total of more than 45 million cubic meters of earth and stone work for the annual repairs of main, branch, and civil dykes. In 1954, after the victory in the flood control struggle, large-scale dam closing and dyke restoration projects were immediately carried out, totaling more than 72.5 million cubic meters of earthwork and 300,000 cubic meters of stonework. According to the test of this year's first flood peak, the dam closing and dyke restoration projects have proved to be solid.
    In order to overcome drought and waterlogging, according to incomplete statistics, in the past two years, the province has built and renovated 135 various large and medium-sized flood control, irrigation, and drainage projects, and built and renovated about 400,000 various small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, benefiting a total of more than 19 million mu of farmland, greatly enhancing the ability to prevent drought, flood, drain water and eliminate waterlogging.
    Experience has proved that comprehensive treatment projects are important, but small-scale farmland water conservancy must not be ignored. Therefore, in the future, in addition to actively cooperating with the implementation of the state's Jianghan comprehensive treatment project and continuing to strengthen dykes, we must also fully mobilize the masses in a planned way on the basis of agricultural cooperativization, build small-scale farmland water conservancy, and gradually develop pumping stations to fight for increased production and guaranteed harvest.
      (3) Adopting necessary technical measures in accordance with local conditions is another important aspect of agricultural increase. Relying on the leading and demonstration role of mutual aid and cooperation organizations and various agricultural production experts, relying on the active efforts of state-owned farms, technical promotion stations at all levels, and the vast number of rural workers, in the past two years, we have also done a lot of work in summarizing and promoting advanced production experience and implementing various specific production increase measures, and have achieved the following results:
    Promotion of improved varieties. As of 1955, the province promoted 7.48 million mu of improved rice varieties of Victory Xian, accounting for 28.35 percent of the planting area; 1.8 million mu of improved wheat varieties of Nanda 2419, accounting for 11.05 percent of the planting area; 2.4 million mu of improved cotton varieties such as Daizi cotton, accounting for 27.82 percent of the planting area; and improved varieties of other high-yield crops such as Jin Queen corn and Soviet red potatoes are also being actively promoted. The promotion of various improved varieties can generally increase production by 10 to 30 percent, and higher ones can increase production by more than 50 percent. This is indeed a simple and easy-to-implement method of increasing production that is easily accepted by the masses. Practice has proved that there are improved varieties everywhere, and farmers also have the habit of selecting seeds. Therefore, emphasizing local seed selection is important. The introduction of improved varieties from other places must be tested first and then gradually promoted.
    Expand the multiple cropping area. Hubei Province has a warm climate and a long frost-free period, which provides favorable conditions for harvesting an extra season. In the few years since liberation, the winter planting area has gradually expanded. However, multiple cropping has contradictions, the most prominent of which is the contradiction between the upper and lower crops. Therefore, under the conditions of possible soil fertility and labor, it is necessary to appropriately seek solutions from the selection of varieties and the improvement of cultivation methods. Experience has proved that it is suitable for Hubei to plant multiple crops of Nanda 2419 wheat, March yellow barley, rape, and broad beans. These varieties mature early and have little impact on the next crop. In addition, in terms of cultivation methods, some current experiences are also worth promoting. For example, the experience of "sparse seedlings and strong seedlings" and "seedling transplanting method" promoted in the Huanggang area has solved the time contradiction between rice and wheat double cropping. Another example is the "strip sowing intercropping" method promoted in Jingzhou and Xiangyang areas, which provides favorable conditions for solving the contradiction between cotton and wheat double cropping and striving for a bumper harvest of cotton and wheat.
    Gradually expanding the multiple cropping area is indeed an important way to increase production. However, if it is blindly expanded, regardless of soil fertility and the next crop, it will also cause losses. Therefore, it must rely on agricultural production cooperatives to gradually promote it, and cannot be done rashly.
    Plant more high-yield crops. The planting area of ​​potatoes in Hubei Province is about 3.8 million mu, with a low yield of about 1,000 catties per mu on average. In the next three years, it is planned to expand the potato area by another 3 million to 4 million mu. After the promotion of improved varieties and processing and cultivation, it is possible to increase the yield by 1,000 to 2,000 catties per mu. This is equivalent to increasing grain production by several hundred million catties. All mountainous counties in the province must first attach importance to the specific arrangements for this work.
    Reclaim wasteland and expand cultivated land area. The province has about 5 million mu or more of wasteland that can be utilized, of which 70 percent is distributed in whole pieces in the Jianghan Plain area, and the soil is fertile; however, it needs to be combined with the consolidation of the Honghu and Changhu water systems and the comprehensive treatment project of the Fuhe River to carry out water conservancy construction before it can be gradually reclaimed. Specialized institutions have now been established to conduct surveying and planning, and it is required to cultivate 900,000 mu before 1957. In addition, for other scattered wasteland, we must also mobilize the masses to develop it locally in conjunction with water conservancy construction.
    Fertilizer is also a very important issue in striving for increased production. In the past, Hubei Province mobilized the masses to pick pond mud and dig grass skin every year, which achieved great results; however, not enough attention was paid to promoting pig manure and green manure. Arrangements have been made this year to develop more new fertilizer sources. Gradually promoting new agricultural tools, improving cultivation techniques, and advocating intensive farming are also important conditions for striving for increased production.
    The above aspects have proved to be the basic methods of increasing production. In order to strive for stable annual increases in production and complete the planned production increase tasks, it is necessary to continue to implement these aspects.

III. Strengthen Specific Leadership over Agricultural Production

    In the past two years, Hubei Province has made some efforts to improve leadership methods, the most prominent of which is changing the "one-size-fits-all" leadership method, strengthening collective leadership, and implementing the method of division of labor and responsibility.
    Since last winter, the Provincial Party Committee has passed a resolution on improving the leadership methods of counties, districts, and townships, and advocated the leadership method of holding on-site meetings in key areas; at the same time, the rectification of the organs has also emphasized opposing the general working style of bureaucracy. These measures have all achieved some results. These are the good aspects and the progressive aspects.
    The main shortcomings at present are that the general leadership method has not been completely changed. The specific manifestations are: too many meetings, too many instructions, too little in-depth inspection, too little specific help, and too little careful summary of experience. Holding meetings and issuing instructions are of course necessary. But limiting yourself to these is serious bureaucracy.
    The issue of leadership methods is not a problem that can be solved in isolation. First of all, it must improve the ideological level of rural workers and give full play to their high enthusiasm for socialist revolution. This is the premise and foundation for solving leadership methods. After the land reform, some people said that farmers would produce themselves and did not need leadership, which is obviously extremely wrong. We have criticized this point of view; at the same time, it should also be pointed out that mechanically copying and forcing orders are also wrong. However, the general leadership method is precisely the root cause of promoting laissez-faire and forced orders. If the general problem of leadership methods is not solved, deviations in the work below will continue to occur.
    From existing experience, the method of holding on-site meetings in key areas is an effective way to achieve specific leadership. It is both a method of the mass line and a method of solving the problem of combining points and surfaces. Using this method educates both the masses and the cadres.
    However, promoting this method is not without resistance, mainly because some staff members have complacency and cannot see the wisdom of the masses. Therefore, it is necessary to educate cadres and deeply understand Chairman Mao's teachings: it is necessary to put down the airs, first be a student, and then be a teacher.
    It is very necessary to educate cadres to comprehensively care about rural policies. Because various rural policies are conducive to production and promote production, any deviation will directly affect production.
    It now seems that it is still necessary to repeatedly explain that agricultural increase is the common requirement of the state and farmers, and it is also the fundamental purpose of developing agricultural production cooperatives. Agricultural transformation and agricultural increase are unified and cannot be neglected. If agricultural increase is neglected or relaxed, not only will agricultural production cooperatives not be consolidated, but various rural work will be in a passive state, causing serious difficulties in the process of advancement.
    The National Plan and the various measures for implementing the plan must also be specifically discussed and arranged by party committees and people's committees at all levels. How to implement the various tasks must have correct methods and corresponding organizational work. In order to further strengthen technical guidance for agricultural increase, the Provincial Party Committee decided to allocate county-level staff to strengthen the work of the county agricultural section.
    The tasks of the last three years of the Five-Year Plan are arduous, and there are difficulties. However, as long as we follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee, actively and steadily develop agricultural production cooperatives, and vigorously strengthen specific leadership over agricultural production, we believe that according to the current conditions in Hubei Province, it is entirely possible to complete and overfulfill the National Plan.

    湖北省两年来在农业生产方面执行国家计划的情况和问题
    湖北省省长　刘子厚
    一、两年来农业生产的基本情况
    一九五三年是执行第一个五年计划的头一年。这一年全省粮食产量完成计划百分之一百零四点五，较一九五二年增加百分之七点二二；棉花因灾减产，也完成计划的百分之九十一点六四，相当于一九五二年的百分之九十一点一二。
    一九五四年全省遭遇了百年来未有的特大洪水，但由于中央人民政府和毛主席的关怀，以及全国各地的大力支援，我们终于战胜了洪水，缩小了灾害，同时大力开展了生产自救运动，为恢复生产准备了极有利的条件。
    今年的任务是艰巨的，一面要恢复灾区生产，同时总产量又要有所增加。
    今年麦收总产量预计十七亿九千万斤，完成计划的百分之一百零四点九。目前禾苗生长情况很好，秋季丰收在望。只要我们抓紧防汛、抗旱和除虫工作，争取超额完成增产计划是完全可能的。
    根据几年来的生产情况来看，农业增产潜力是很大的，但是由于当前各种条件的限制，收成的不稳定是一个严重的问题。因此，在现有条件下，尽力战胜自然灾害，争取年年稳定增产，已成为全省人民的迫切要求。
  二、对于农业增产关键的体会
    经验证明，湖北省要完成农业增产计划，必须抓住以下几个关键。
      （一）大力发展农业生产合作社。两年来，湖北省根据“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，大力开展了互助合作运动。截至一九五五年春，组织起来的农户已占全省总农户的百分之六十六点七九。其中农业生产合作社已发展到一万四千二百五十个，参加农户有三十万零五千多户。互助合作组织同单干农民在生产方面相比，具有显著的优越性，而农业合作社则更显著和突出。根据孝感、襄阳等十个县十三个农业生产合作社的统计：一九五四年农业生产合作社粮食作物（水稻）单位产量高于当地单干农民单位产量的百分之二十八强；高于当地临时互助组单位产量的百分之二十三点二九；高于当地常年互助组单位产量的百分之十五点六四。同时各地运用各种形式的互助合作网的领导方法，以社带组，社、组带单干农民，有力地推动了整个农业生产运动。
    实践已充分证明，发展现有初级形式的农业生产合作社，不仅是引导农民走向社会主义的必要步骤，而且也确实是一种投资少、收效大、收效快的农业增产办法。
    当然，农业生产合作社中的问题还是不少的，如互利问题，生产管理问题。但只要我们注意解决，这些问题是可以解决的。
    两年来，由于合作化运动的健康发展和粮食统购统销政策的正确实施，广大农民已越来越多地倾向于社会主义，积极地要求加入农业生产合作社。
    根据党中央的指示，省委计划在一九五五年度，将农业生产合作社发展到四万五千个，入社农户将占总农户的百分之十六左右；计划到一九五七年秋前，入社农户占总农户的百分之三十五左右。我们认为只要领导抓紧，完成这一任务是可能的。为了实现这一任务，省委决定从全省抽调将近一万四千个优秀工作人员去充实和加强基层组织，组成
  一支有力的办社队伍，加强对合作化运动的具体领导，和进一步贯彻“三定”政策，以促进农业生产运动的进一步发展。
    （二）兴修水利，战胜水旱灾害。湖北省既怕水又怕旱，特别是怕洪水成灾，因而兴修水利，逐步控制和战胜水旱灾害，是农业增产中最突出和带有关键性的环节之一。国家为保证荆江大堤，保障几百万人民生命财产的安全，曾兴修了荆江分洪区。在去年防汛中，显然它已起了重大的作用。
    但在江汉治本计划没有完全实现以前，巩固堤防仍然是每年必须完成的艰巨任务。
    一九五三年全省干、支、民堤岁修工程共完成土、石方四千五百多万公方。一九五四年在防汛斗争胜利之后，随即进行了大规模的堵口复堤工程，计土方七千二百五十多万公方，石方三十万公方。根据今年第一个洪峰的考验，证明堵口复堤的工程是坚固的。
    为了战胜干旱和水涝，根据不完全的统计，两年来，全省共兴建和整修了各种大、中型防洪灌溉排水工程一百三十五处，兴建和整修各种小型农田水利工程约四十多万处，总受益田达一千九百多万亩，大大增强了防旱防洪和排水排渍的能力。
    经验证明，治本工程是重要的，但小型农田水利绝不可忽视。因此，今后除了积极配合国家江汉治本工程的实施和继续加固堤防外，还必须在农业合作化的基础上，有计划地充分发动群众，兴修小型农田水利，并逐步发展抽水机站，为增产保收而斗争。
      （三）因地制宜，采取必要的技术措施，是农业增产的另一个重要方面。依靠互助合作组织和各种农业生产能手的带头示范作用，依靠各级国营农场技术推广站和广大农村工作人员的积极努力，两年来，我们在总结和推广先进生产经验和贯彻各种具体增产措施方面，也作了不少工作，取得了以下的成绩：
    推广了良种。到一九五五年为止，全省推广水稻胜利籼良种七百四十八万亩，占播种面积的百分之二十八点三五；小麦南大二四一九良种一百八十万亩，占播种面积的百分之十一点零五；岱字棉等棉花良种二百四十万亩，占播种面积的百分之二十七点八二；其他如金皇后玉米和苏联红洋芋等高产作物良种，也正在积极推广。推广各种良种一般都可增产一成到三成，高者可增产五成以上。这确是一种简便易行，又易为群众所接受的增产办法。实践证明，各地都有良种，农民也有选种习惯。因此，强调本地选种是重要的，外地引进良种，必须先行试验而后逐步推广。
    扩大复种面积。湖北省气候温暖，无霜期较长，给多收一季提供了有利条件。解放几年来，冬播面积逐年有所扩大。但复种是有矛盾的，最突出的是上下茬的矛盾。因此，在地力、劳力可能的条件下，必须从选种和改进耕作方法方面适当求得解决。经验证明，湖北地区复种南大二四一九小麦、三月黄大麦、油菜、蚕豆等是适宜的。这些品种成熟期早，给下茬影响小。此外，在耕作方法上，现在有些经验也是值得提倡的。如黄冈地区推行的“下稀秧，育壮秧”和“掇秧法”的经验，解决了稻麦两熟的时间矛盾。又如荆州、襄阳地区推行的“条播套种”办法，对解决棉麦两熟矛盾，争取棉麦丰收提供了有利条件。
    逐步扩大复种面积，确是一个增产的重要门路。但如盲目扩大，不顾及地力和下季作物，也会造成损失。因此，必须依靠农业生产合作社，逐步推行，不能贸然从事。
    多种高产作物。湖北省薯类种植面积约为三百八十多万亩，产量低，平均每亩产量一千斤左右。今后三年内计划将薯类面积再扩大三百万到四百万亩，经过良种推广和加工培育，每亩提高产量一、二千斤是可能的。这样就等于增产几亿斤粮食。全省山区各县必须首先重视这项工作的具体安排。
    开垦荒地，扩大耕地面积。全省可以利用的荒地约在五百万亩以上，其中百分之七十是整片分布在江汉平原地区，土质肥沃；但需配合洪湖、长湖水系整理和府河治本工程进行水利建设，才能逐步开垦。现在已经建立了专门机构进行勘测规划，要求在一九五七年前垦种到九十万亩。此外，对其他零星荒地，也要发动群众结合兴修水利就地开发。
    肥料也是争取增产的一个十分重要的问题。湖北省过去每年动员群众挑塘泥、挖草皮是有巨大成绩的；但对提倡猪肥绿肥重视不够，今年已作布置，要多开辟新肥源。逐步推广新式农具，改进耕作技术，提倡精耕细作，也是争取增产的重要条件之一。
    以上几个方面，证明都是增产的基本办法。为了争取稳定的年年增产，完成计划增产任务。需要在这几个方面继续贯彻实行。三、加强对农业生产的具体领导
    两年来湖北省在改进领导方法方面做过一些努力，突出的是改变了“一揽子”的领导方法，加强了集体领导和实行了分工负责的办法。
    去冬以来省委通过了改进县、区、乡领导方法的决议和提倡了深入重点召开现场会议的领导方法；同时机关整风又强调反对官僚主义的一般化作风。这些措施都收到了一些效果。这是好的方面和进步的方面。
    目前的主要缺点是一般化的领导方法还没有完全改变过来，具体表现是：开会多，指示多，深入检查少，具体帮助少，认真总结经验少。开会、发指示当然是需要的。但只限于这些就是严重的官僚主义。
    领导方法问题，不是一个能够孤立解决的问题。它首先必须提高农村工作人员的思想水平，发挥他们的社会主义革命的高度积极性，这是解决领导方法的前提和基础。土地改革结束后，有人说农民自己会生产，用不着领导，这显然是极端错误的。我们已批判过这种观点；同时也应指出，生搬硬套、强迫命令同样是错误的。但是一般化的领导方法正是促成放任自流和强迫命令的根源，不解决领导方法的一般化问题，下面的工作偏差是会不断发生的。
    从现有经验看来，深入重点召开现场会议的方法，是实现具体领导的有效办法。它既是群众路线的方法；同时也是解决点面结合问题的方法。采用这种方法，既教育了群众，又教育了干部。
    但是推行这种方法，不是没有抵触的，主要是有些工作人员有骄傲自满情绪，看不见群众的智慧。因而教育干部，深刻体会毛主席的教导：要放下架子，先当小学生，而后当先生的道理是必要的。
    教育干部全面地关心农村政策是十分必要的。因为农村各项政策都是有利生产和促进生产的，那一方面出了偏差，都会直接影响到生产。
    现在看来，仍须反复说明农业增产是国家和农民的共同要求，同时也是发展农业合作社的根本目的。农业改造和农业增产二者是统一的，不能偏废，如果忽视或放松了农业增产，不但农业生产合作社得不到巩固，即农村各种工作都会陷于被动，造成前进中的严重困难。
    国家计划和贯彻执行计划的各种措施，各级党委和人民委员会也必须具体讨论和具体布置。各项工作如何贯彻，必须有正确的方法和相应的组织工作。为了进一步加强对农业增产的技术指导，省委决定调配县委级工作人员加强县农业科的工作。
    五年计划后三年的任务是繁重的，困难是有的。但只要我们遵照党中央的指示，积极稳步地发展农业生产合作社，并大力加强对农业生产的具体领导，我们相信：按照现在湖北省的条件来说，完成和超额完成国家计划是完全可能的。
