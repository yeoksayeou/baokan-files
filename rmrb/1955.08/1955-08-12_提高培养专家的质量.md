    Improving the Quality of Expert Training
    Mo. Tsyrlin, President of the Molotov Power Institute, Moscow, USSR.
    Science and technology are constantly developing and being enriched by new facts and new theories. In theoretical research, modern and complex mathematical tools are being used, and extremely precise experimental research methods are being applied. Modern engineers must solve comprehensive tasks that require profound and multifaceted knowledge. In order to master modern technology, and especially to promote the continued development of technology, it is necessary to cultivate engineers who are qualitatively superior to previous engineers.
    However, the period for training our experts is still the same as in the past, and in fact even shorter than in the past. This is because, before the Great October Socialist Revolution, when Russian universities implemented a curriculum-based teaching system (the school stipulates the required courses for a certain department, and students can graduate after completing the courses, but there is no fixed teaching plan. – Translator's note), only a few college students could complete the college courses within the prescribed period.
    Therefore, in order to train modern experts in five to five and a half years, it is necessary to improve the teaching process while knowledge becomes more complex and deeper. The experience of the Moscow Power Institute proves that, in order to improve the students' knowledge level, if the teaching and research department does not reform the teaching methods, simply adopting the method of expanding the scope of requirements for students and complicating the assignments will have the opposite effect to the original intention. It will overburden the students, which is detrimental to consolidating the acquired knowledge.
    In this case, students often have to be content with simply reviewing lecture notes, instead of delving into textbooks. Design and experiments are rushed, and students will resort to plagiarism and uncritical imitation in order to complete tasks that are beyond their capabilities. Students quickly learn things that they quickly forget, and they cannot develop the habit of creative independent work. This was the case at the Moscow Power Institute in 1945. In the past and now, the teaching process in many other universities has also been adversely affected by the excessive workload of students. Some teachers still have the view that the phenomenon of excessive workload of college students is an inevitable result of the fact that students must study more complex and broader issues within a certain period.
    The Moscow Power Institute set itself the task of improving the teaching process in order to create conditions for students to work independently and in a balanced manner, avoid cramming and overburdening, enable students to get normal rest, and allocate a certain amount of time for all-round development. All the teachers also set themselves the goal of improving the level of engineer training and developing their habit of independent work.
    The basic task of higher education is not to make college students memorize as much practical material as possible, but to enable them to master scientific methods and learn to continue their studies independently after graduating from college. It is impossible to learn everything that modern experts need in universities. Universities should lay a solid and sufficiently broad foundation of basic knowledge for students; on this basis, young engineers will gradually enrich themselves in practical work and reach the level of modern experts.
    In order to achieve this goal, the first condition is to introduce only the basic and main materials in each subject, and to eliminate secondary and descriptive materials. All subjects are constantly supplemented with new materials, but this does not mean that the amount of courses should be increased. As new materials are added, old materials should be compressed. Eliminating outdated knowledge from teaching materials will make the conclusions simpler and clearer, and the teaching materials for each subject will be more concise and complete.
    The second important condition is to plan the teaching process according to the time factor. When formulating the plan, it is necessary to allocate the time required for students to work independently, and the amount of assignments given by the teaching and research department should be adapted to this time; the assignments arranged by each teaching and research department should be distributed throughout the semester, so that these assignments are not crowded into the same time, so that the students' learning can be carried out in a balanced manner.
    The teaching method is reformed in such a way that it should make various teaching methods have as many positive effects as possible. The various courses listed on the timetable should play the role of organizing and supervising students' independent work outside the classroom. All courses should guide students to delve into books, delve into textbooks, and independently solve the tasks assigned to them.
    The Moscow Power Institute went through a considerable period of exploration before implementing the current teaching method. In 1947, our institute requested the Ministry of Higher Education to allow a reduction in the number of class hours for required courses, and to set aside days exclusively for students to study on their own in laboratories, libraries, and at home. The experience of implementing the new teaching plan, as well as the continuous improvement of the teaching methods of lecturing on various courses, merging courses, eliminating duplication, and reducing the learning methods with the worst initiative—small class classroom exercises—has enabled us to continuously reduce the number of class hours for required courses in the past ten years. This reduction can be seen from the following table:
    The reduction in the number of class hours for required courses gives students more possibilities to study the learning materials independently and creates conditions for the planning of this learning. For many years, the teaching and research departments have modified the content and teaching methods, the content and methods of homework, and especially the content and methods of experiments. The proportion of experiments has increased; while the total number of experiments has decreased, the teaching and research departments have strived to deepen the content of the experiments. When doing experiments, students are required to prepare well in advance and to develop the spirit of independent work when doing the experiments.
    The experience gained by the teaching and research department in improving the teaching methods in combination with considering the time spent by each student in studying the course is fixed in some documents called "teaching methods for each subject". When compiling these documents, the college has a committee responsible for discussing the coordination of the content and weight of various subjects with similar properties and sequential connections, so as to formulate unified teaching methods, unified terms and unified symbols, etc. At the same time, the places where lectures and internship course materials are repeated are also deleted. The experiments that students do successively throughout their time in college also have a rigorous and logical system.
    In order to discover the most valuable and effective methods from the teaching experience of excellent teachers and teaching and research departments, our college has established a teaching method research committee to review the teaching methods used in various courses. As a result of the work of this committee, a book "General Recommendations on the Teaching Methods of Various Teaching Methods" was published. This book has been published in two editions and is now being prepared for the third edition.
    While improving the teaching plan and teaching methods, the system of planned required assignments has also been formulated and improved. Each student needs to know at the beginning of the semester the amount and completion deadline of all assignments stipulated for him by the teaching and research department. Each teaching and research department knows how much time is available to students and how to stipulate the amount of assignments according to these times. For this reason, some documents called "Homework Instruction Chart" are also made. These charts are formulated by the department heads and distributed to each student. It makes the work of each teaching and research department coordinated.
    In addition to the above-mentioned charts, first and second grade students also have various teaching outlines and teaching calendars, as well as examples of homework. These documents are compiled into a booklet.
    The planning system of required course assignments is combined with the work of supervising the time spent by students on experiments. The supervision system can reduce the gap between the teaching and research department's estimation of the workload and the actual amount of work. The supervision and systematic research of teaching quality is realized through mutual observation during lectures and then discussion. At the same time, the results of course design and graduation design and other forms of course work carried out by various teaching and research departments should also be discussed.
    The analysis of these results shows that all these measures are helpful to ensure that students have a balanced workload throughout the semester. Students have to do a lot of work, but the previous cramming phenomenon no longer exists, and most students no longer have an extremely tense period at the end of the semester, before the exam. The effort that students put into the course content throughout the semester reduces the preparation before the exam and makes the learned things remembered more firmly.
    Some thorough and systematic measures implemented in improving teaching methods according to the time that students can allocate have enabled senior students to adopt new independent working methods, that is, learning, research and experiments conducted in the college's laboratories. Each student must do some research work of a small amount, that is, require studying some documents and summarizing them, doing experiments or theoretical analysis. In addition to the number of class hours for required courses listed in the table, the 1955 teaching plan also includes 350 hours as the time for students to conduct learning and research according to the timetable of the teaching and research department. We believe that this kind of work is the most active and creative form of independent work for students.
    The investigation of the teaching process shows that the college is doing the right thing in the teaching method work; it is completely possible to avoid students' learning burden being too heavy and to train engineers who meet the requirements of modern technology. At the same time, students also have time to engage in independent scientific research, and also have time to devote themselves to their all-round development and get reasonable rest.
    Experience has proved that the students' exam results have begun to improve; they have used textbooks, reference books and other books more widely; the quality of course design and graduation design has improved, and many designs have solved practical problems in production.
    Although there are achievements in general, there are still many shortcomings in the teaching progress; to maintain the existing level and further improve it, a lot of work has to be done. Therefore, our college is still continuing to work hard to make the teaching method have a perfect scientific basis and to improve the ability of all teachers and improve their proficiency in science and teaching.

    提高培养专家的质量
    苏联莫斯科莫洛托夫动力学院院长　莫·齐利金
    科学和技术在不断地发展，并由新的事实和新的理论不断地充实起来。在理论研究方面，已经在使用着现代化的、复杂的数学工具，运用着异常精确的实验研究方法。现代的工程师必须解决需要具有深湛而多方面的知识才能解决的综合性的任务。为了掌握现代技术，特别是为了促进技术的继续发展，就必须培养出在质量上比以前的工程师更为优秀的工程师。
    但是，我们培养专家的期限还跟过去一样，实际上甚至比过去还要短些，因为在伟大十月社会主义革命以前，俄国各高等学校实行课程教学制度（学校规定某一系科的必修课程，学生修习完毕后才能毕业，但是没有固定的教学计划。——译者注）时，只有个别的大学生能在规定期限内学完学院的课程。
    因此，为了在五年到五年半时间内培养出现代的专家，就必须随着知识的日趋复杂和加深，同时改善教学过程。莫斯科动力学院的经验证明，为了提高学生的知识水平，教研室如不去改革教学方法，单纯采取扩大对学生要求的范围和使作业复杂化的办法，其结果就会同原来的愿望相反，使学生课业负担过重，这对巩固所获得的知识是不利的。
    在这种情况下，就往往使得学生们不得不仅仅满足于复习听课笔记，而不去深入钻研课本。设计和实验都是赶着做，学生们为了完成力不胜任的作业，就会采取抄袭和不加批判地摹仿的办法。学生们很快学到的东西很快就忘记了，同时也不能养成创造性地独立工作的习惯。莫斯科动力学院在一九四五年就曾有过这样的情形。过去以及现在许多别的高等学校的教学过程，也因学生学习负担过重而受到不利的影响。有些教员现在还有一种看法，认为大学生学习负担过重的现象，是由于学生们必须在一定期限内研究更复杂和更广泛的问题而产生的必然结果。
    莫斯科动力学院给自己提出了改善教学过程的任务，以便为学生们均衡地独立工作创造条件，避免突击和负担过重现象，使学生们能得到正常的休息，并为全面发展划出一定的时间。全体教师也为自己定出了目标，这个目标就是提高培养工程师的水平，并使他们养成独立工作的习惯。
    高等学校教学的基本任务，并不是使大学生们尽可能多记些实际材料，而是使他们掌握科学的方法，学会在高等学校毕业后能够独立地继续进行学习。在高等学校里不可能学到现代的专家所必需的一切。高等学校应当给学生打下坚固的、充分广泛的基本知识的基础；在这个基础上，青年工程师在实际工作中将逐渐充实自己，使达到现代专家的水平。
    为了达到这个目的，第一个条件就是在各门学科中只介绍基本的、主要的材料，而取消次要的、叙述性的材料。所有的学科都在不断补充着新的材料，但这并不是说应当增加课程的分量。随着增加新的材料，就要压缩旧的材料。从教材中淘汰掉过时的知识，就会使结论下得更加简单明了，各科教材就会更加紧凑和完整。
    第二个重要的条件是根据时间因素规划教学过程。在制定计划时，要为学生们划出独立工作所需的时间，教研室给的作业的分量应跟这种时间相适应；各教研室布置的作业应分布在整个学期，使这些作业不致挤在同一个时间，以便学生们的学习能够均衡地进行。
    教学法是这样进行改革的，它应当使各种教学方式具有尽可能多的积极作用。授课时间表上所列的各种课业均应起组织和监督学生们课外独立工作的作用。一切课程都应当引导学生们去钻研书本，钻研教科书，去独立解决分配给自己的任务。
    莫斯科动力学院在实施现行的教学法以前，曾经过相当长时间的摸索。一九四七年，我们学院曾要求高等教育部允许缩减必修课的授课时数，并专为学生们定出在研究室、图书馆和在家里自修的日子。实施新教学计划的经验，以及不断改进讲授各项课程的教学法、合并课程、消除重复现象和减少积极性最差的学习方式——小班课堂练习的结果，使我们能在近十年来不断缩减必修课的授课时数。这种缩减的情况可以从下表看出来：
    必修课授课时数的缩减，给学生们独立钻研学习材料以更大的可能，并为这种学习的计划化创造了条件。许多年来，各教研室对各科内容和讲授方法、家庭作业的内容和方式，特别是实验的内容和做法，都作了修改。实验的比重增加了；在总的实验个数减少的情况下，各教研室力求加深实验的内容。在做实验时，要求学生们事先很好地准备，并在做实验时发挥独立工作的精神。
    教研室结合考虑每个学生学习该课程所用的时间而进行的改善教学法的工作所取得的经验，在一些被称作“各科教学法”的文件中固定下来了。在编写这些文件时，学院里设有一个委员会，负责商讨各个性质相近和有前后连贯的科目的内容和分量彼此配合的问题，以便订出统一的讲授方法，统一的名词术语和划一的符号等。同时，还删除了讲课和实习课教材中重复的地方。学生们在上大学的整个时期中陆续做的实验，也有了严整的、合乎逻辑的系统。
    为了从优秀的教员和教研室的教学经验中发掘出最有价值和最有效果的方法，我们学院设立了教学法研究委员会，来审查各种课程中所运用的教学方法。这个委员会工作的结果，出版了一本“对各种教学方式的教学方法的一般性建议”。这本书已经出了两版，现在正准备出第三版。
    在改进教学计划和教学方法的同时，还拟定并改善了必修作业计划化的制度。每个学生在学期开始时都需要了解教研室为他规定的一切作业的分量和完成的期限。每个教研室都知道有多少时间归学生支配和应当怎样根据这些时间来规定作业分量。为此还制出一些名为“家庭作业指示图表”的文件。这些图表由各系主任制定，并印发给每一个学生。它使各教研室的工作协调一致。
    一、二年级的学生除了得到上述的图表以外，还有各种教学大纲和教学日历，以及家庭作业范例。这些文件合起来印成一本小册子。
    必修课作业的计划化制度是和对学生们实验耗费的时间进行监督的工作结合着的。监督制度可以减少在教研室估计课业分量和工作的实际分量之间所存在的脱节现象。对教学质量的监督和系统的研究，是通过在讲课时互相观摩，并接着以进行讨论的方法来实现的。同时，对课程设计和毕业设计以及各教研室所进行的其他形式的课业的结果，也要加以讨论。
    这些结果的分析表明，所有这些措施，对于保证学生在整个学期中负担均衡是有帮助的。学生们必须做很多工作，但是以前的突击现象已不存在，大多数学生在学期终了时，在考试以前，不再有一段极度紧张的时期。学生们在整个学期中对课程内容所下的功夫，减轻了考试前的准备，并使学到的东西记得更加牢固。
    在根据学生们能够支配的时间改进教学法方面所实行的一些彻底的、有系统的措施，使高年级学生能采取新的独立工作方式，即在学院的实验室里进行的学习、研究、实验。每个学生都必须做分量不大的一些研究工作，即要求钻研一些文献并加以摘要，做实验或理论分析。除了表内所列的必修课程的授课时数以外，一九五五年的教学计划中还列入三百五十小时作为学生们按照教研室的时间表进行学习研究的时间。我们认为，这种作业是学生们独立工作的最有积极意义和创造性的一种形式。
    对教学过程的考察表明，学院在教学法的工作中做得是对的；避免学生学习负担过重，而又培养出合乎现代技术要求的工程师，是完全可能的。同时，学生们还有时间从事独立的科学研究，也有时间致力于他们的全面发展和得到合理的休息。
    经验证明，学生们考试的成绩是开始好起来了；他们更广泛地运用了课本、参考书和其他书籍；课程设计和毕业设计的质量提高了，很多设计解决了生产中的实际问题。
    总的说来虽然是有成绩的，但在教学进度方面还有许多缺点；要保持现有水平并进一步加以提高，还得做很多工作。因此，我们学院仍在继续努力，使教学法有完善的科学基础，并提高全体教师的能力，提高他们在科学方面和教学方面的熟练程度。　（本报特约稿）
