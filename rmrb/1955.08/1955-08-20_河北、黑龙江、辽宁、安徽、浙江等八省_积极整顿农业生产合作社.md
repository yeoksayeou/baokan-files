(Report from our newspaper) Under the leadership of local CCP committees, agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Yunnan, and Gansu provinces have rationally resolved issues such as investment shares and the cost of renting land, draught animals, and farm tools, based on the principles of voluntary participation and mutual benefit. In accordance with the Party's class policy in rural areas, they have also appropriately adjusted the leading cadres in a small number of cooperatives and purged landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries who had infiltrated the cooperatives. On the basis of this rectification, local Party organizations have also helped each cooperative to formulate plans for expanding reproduction this year, mobilizing members to tap production potential and find key and effective methods for increasing production. Through this series of efforts, the general agricultural production cooperatives have been consolidated and improved, and the members have a great enthusiasm for production.

The work of rectifying agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei Province has largely been completed. The agricultural production cooperatives in various regions, after rectification, have launched a production increase competition movement between cooperatives and teams. According to statistics from 81 counties in six special districts including Tangshan and Cangxian alone, more than 29,000 cooperatives participated in the production increase competition. Over a month, more than 2,000 cooperatives in 27 counties, including Changli and Yutian, launched a fertilizer accumulation competition, with members accumulating more than 38 million jin of fertilizer, preparing sufficient fertilizer for planting wheat after autumn.

In Heilongjiang Province, more than 90 percent of the existing 23,850 agricultural production cooperatives have been consolidated or can be consolidated. Now, these cooperatives have completed the summer hoeing task ahead of schedule, and the crops are generally growing well.

In Liaoning Province, after half a year of rectification and improvement of agricultural production cooperatives, most cooperatives have gradually been consolidated. However, about 15 percent of the cooperatives in the province still have more problems and are not very consolidated. In response to this situation, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the CPC requires leading staff of municipal and county committees to delve into key areas to check the implementation of the cooperative policy and solve problems in a concrete manner. From the end of hoeing to the end of autumn harvest, Liaoning Province will further consolidate and improve the existing 30,000 agricultural production cooperatives in order to create conditions for the establishment of new cooperatives after autumn.

The work of rectifying agricultural production cooperatives in Anhui Province has been completed. In rectifying agricultural production cooperatives, all regions have attached equal importance to both spontaneously organized cooperatives without approval and those that have been approved, and have strengthened leadership over areas with weak foundations and cooperatives with more problems. In the work of developing agricultural production cooperatives from last winter to this spring, the number of formally approved cooperatives in the province increased from the original 5,000 to more than 38,400. At the same time, due to the influence of the old cooperatives and the enthusiasm of farmers to take the path of cooperation, farmers spontaneously established more than 11,800 cooperatives. After two seasons of rectification in spring and summer, 98 percent of the formally approved cooperatives have been consolidated, and more than 75 percent of the spontaneously established cooperatives have also been consolidated.

In Zhejiang Province, after the agricultural production cooperatives have rectified the policy of mutual benefit, the members have a great enthusiasm for production. After more than 140 cooperatives in Xiaoshan County resolved specific issues such as distribution, investment, and the entry of cattle and farm tools into the cooperatives in accordance with the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit, more than 90 percent of the cooperatives revised their production plans, implemented a contracting system, and strived to increase production. Many agricultural production cooperatives in the Ningbo and Wenzhou special districts increased the area of double-cropping rice after implementing the policy of mutual benefit. In Hang County, 13 agricultural production cooperatives that rectified the policy of mutual benefit had 26 middle peasant households who originally planned to withdraw from the cooperatives after autumn, but now they no longer want to withdraw.

The summer work of rectifying and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives in Fujian Province has made new progress. According to preliminary statistics from eight special districts, more than 5,000 cooperatives have completed the rectification in one stage, and more than 6,000 cooperatives are being rectified. Most of the cooperatives that have been rectified have paid attention to checking and promoting the production of the cooperatives from the beginning, and combined with improving labor organization and production management, so that a new atmosphere has emerged in production. Specific policies have also been implemented in the rectification. Among the 183 cooperatives in Yong'an Special District that have basically completed the rectification, 30 cooperatives have adjusted the unreasonable cattle rent originally set, and 39 cooperatives have corrected the phenomenon of low fertilizer valuation. In Longxi and other six counties in Longxi Special District, 179 cooperatives have corrected the deviations of land evaluation being too high or too low, and 45 cooperatives have adjusted the land labor distribution ratio.

After rectification, the 7,000 agricultural production cooperatives established in Yunnan Province last autumn have generally increased production. In this year's preliminary distribution in early spring, 85 percent of the cooperatives increased production. The labor efficiency of these cooperatives is generally about 20 percent higher than before joining the cooperatives, the yield per unit area is generally 10 to 30 percent higher than when individual production was practiced, and the production cost is reduced by 5 to 10 percent.

All 6,646 agricultural production cooperatives established in Gansu Province since last autumn have been rectified. Together with the old cooperatives established before last autumn, all 7,419 agricultural production cooperatives in the province have been basically consolidated.

    河北、黑龙江、辽宁、安徽、浙江等八省
    积极整顿农业生产合作社
    本报讯　河北、黑龙江、辽宁、安徽、浙江、福建、云南、甘肃等省的农业生产合作社，在当地中共党委领导下，根据自愿互利原则，合理解决了入股投资和土地、耕畜、农具的租用代价等问题；并根据党在农村的阶级政策，适当地调整了少数社的领导骨干分子，清洗了混进社内的地主、富农和反革命分子。在整顿基础上，各地党组织又帮助各社订出今年扩大再生产的计划，发动社员挖掘生产潜力，找出增产关键和窍门。经过这一系列的工作，一般的农业生产合作社都得到了巩固和提高，社员的生产劲头很大。
    河北省整顿农业生产合作社的工作已大体结束。各地经过整顿的农业生产合作社，展开了社与社、队与队之间的增产竞赛运动。仅据唐山、沧县等六个专区八十一个县的统计，就有二万九千多个社参加了增产竞赛。昌黎、玉田等二十七个县的二千多个社开展积肥竞赛一个月内，社员们就积肥三千八百多万斤，为秋后种麦准备了足够的肥料。
    黑龙江省现有的两万三千八百五十多个农业生产合作社，有百分之九十以上已经巩固或可以巩固下来。现在，这些社都已提前完成了夏锄任务，庄稼普遍长得很好。
    辽宁省经过半年来对农业生产合作社的整顿和提高，大多数社已逐渐巩固。但是，全省还有百分之十五左右的社问题较多，很不巩固。针对这种情况，中共辽宁省委要求市、县委的领导工作人员深入重点，检查合作化政策的执行情况，具体地解决问题。在挂锄到秋收结束，辽宁省还将进一步巩固和提高现有的三万多个农业生产合作社，以便为秋后建立新社创造条件。
    安徽省整顿农业生产合作社的工作已经结束。各地在整顿农业生产合作社时，对自发组织起来，没有经过批准的社和已经批准的社都同样重视，并对原来基础薄弱的地区和问题较多的社加强领导。全省在去冬今春发展农业生产合作社工作中，正式批准的社从原来的五千个增加到三万八千四百多个。同时，由于老社的影响和农民走合作化道路的热情提高，农民还自发地办起了一万一千八百多个社。经过春、夏两季整顿，被正式批准的社有百分之九十八得到了巩固，自发办起来的社也有百分之七十五以上巩固了下来。
    浙江省经过端正互利政策的农业生产合作社，社员的生产劲头很大。萧山县一百四十多个社根据自愿互利政策的原则解决了分配、投资和耕牛农具入社等具体问题后，百分之九十以上的社都修订了生产计划，实行了包工制，争取增产。宁波、温州专区很多农业生产合作社贯彻互利政策后增加了扩种双季稻的面积。杭县十三个端正了互利政策的农业生产合作社，有二十六户中农原来打算在秋后退社，现在也不想退了。
    福建省夏季整顿巩固农业生产合作社的工作又有了新的进展。据八个专区的初步统计，整顿告一段落的社已有五千多个，正在整顿的有六千多个。大部经过整顿的社，由于一开始都注意了检查和推动社的生产，并结合改善劳动组织和生产管理，使生产上出现了新气象。具体政策也在整顿中得到贯彻。永安专区已基本整顿结束的一百八十三个社中，有三十个社调整了原来订得不合理的牛租，有三十九个社纠正了肥料折价偏低的现象。龙溪专区龙溪等六县，有一百七十九个社纠正了土地评产偏高偏低的偏差，四十五个社调整了土地劳力分红比例。
    云南省去年秋季建立的七千个农业生产合作社经过整顿后，生产普遍提高。在今年小春预分中就有百分之八十五的社增产。这些社劳动效率一般的比入社前提高了百分之二十左右，单位面积产量一般比个体生产时增加百分之十到三十，生产成本节约百分之五到百分之十。
    甘肃省从去年秋季以来建立的六千六百四十六个农业生产合作社，已经全部进行了整顿。加上去年秋季以前建立的老社，现在全省七千四百一十九个农业生产合作社基本上都得到了巩固。
