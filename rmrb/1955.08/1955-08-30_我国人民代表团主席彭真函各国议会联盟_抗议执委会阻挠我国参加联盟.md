Xinhua News Agency, August 29th:

　　Peng Zhen, Chairman of the People's Delegation of China to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, wrote a letter on August 28th to Lord Stansgate, Chairman of the Council of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and Mr. Lennart Hielm-Hielm, Chairman of the 44th Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, requesting them to forward the letter to the Executive Committee, the Council, and the 44th Conference of the Union. The full text of the letter is as follows:

　　Mr. Chairman Lord Stansgate, Mr. Chairman Lennart Hielm-Hielm, and to all ladies and gentlemen of the Executive Committee, the Council, and the 44th Conference of the Union:

　　We are pleased to note that many executive committee members, council members, and parliamentary representatives from many countries in the Union support and welcome the participation of the People's Delegation of the People's Republic of China as a member of the Union. However, the Executive Committee of the Union, due to the insistence of a few members, including the United States, decided to delay the issue of the People's Delegation of the People's Republic of China joining the Union, thereby obstructing the participation of the People's Delegation of the People's Republic of China in the Inter-Parliamentary Union. I believe that this decision of the Executive Committee is a complete violation of the purpose and charter of the Union and is illegal. On behalf of the People's Delegation of the People's Republic of China to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, I hereby lodge a solemn protest.

　　Respected ladies and gentlemen, because the Chinese people have a fervent desire to promote peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation among all countries, and because the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China passed a resolution in February 1955, advocating that parliaments of all countries should shoulder the important responsibility of safeguarding and consolidating world peace and take concrete steps to develop friendly and cooperative relations among the people of all countries, the representatives of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China decided to organize a delegation to participate in the Inter-Parliamentary Union. I already notified the relevant leaders of the Union on July 24th of this year that the representatives of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China had decided to join the Inter-Parliamentary Union. Subsequently, we completed all the procedures for joining the Union and attending this conference. Chairman Lord Stansgate and Secretary-General de Blonay both believed that our procedures were complete. Then, on what grounds did the Executive Committee of the Union decide to postpone the discussion of China's accession to the Union, thereby refusing the participation of the delegation of the People's Republic of China in the Union? Obviously, those who insist on opposing the participation of the People's Delegation of the People's Republic of China in the Union do so not to end the "Cold War," but to continue the "Cold War," not to ease international tensions, but to aggravate international tensions, not to promote friendly cooperation among countries, but to create confrontation and division among countries. Because they did not get the support of the majority, they even stated that if the Chinese People's Delegation participated in the Union, they and their friends would withdraw from the Union. I would like to sincerely inform those gentlemen who hold a rashly hostile attitude towards China of "either you or me" that the People's Republic of China, with its 600 million people united as one, will not disappear from the face of the earth simply because some people dislike it, curse it, reject it in this way, or deny it in that way. Since we live on the same planet, should we adopt an attitude of "either you or me," or should we engage in friendly cooperation and peaceful coexistence with each other on the basis of equality and mutual benefit? It is the responsibility of our parliamentarians to reflect and realize the will and aspirations of the voters. I think it would be best for everyone to calm down a bit and, in accordance with the wishes of the people of the world, especially the wishes of their own voters, adopt peaceful consultation methods and sit down face to face for discussions. If the American parliamentarians are willing to face the truth, willing to truly represent the wishes of the American people to ease international tensions and promote peaceful coexistence among countries, then why not sit down with the representatives of the Chinese people for consultations? History will prove that the attempt to insist on opposing the participation of the Chinese People's Delegation in the Union is bound to fail in the end.

　　All fair-minded people will admit that only the People's Delegation of the People's Republic of China can represent China in the Inter-Parliamentary Union. However, some people are attempting to realize their so-called "two Chinas" conspiracy by temporarily shelving the issue of our delegation's participation in the Union. I hereby solemnly declare that the Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate any talk or practice of "two Chinas." If the issue of the People's Delegation of the People's Republic of China's participation in the Inter-Parliamentary Union is compared with the so-called application of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which has long been unanimously spurned by the Chinese people, or if the issue of China's participation in the Union is handled with such and such so-called "two Chinas" practices, it is in fact refusing the participation of the Chinese People's Delegation in the Union, interfering in China's internal affairs, and attempting to turn the Union into a tool for those warmongers who are enemies of the 600 million Chinese people and who vainly attempt to subvert the People's Republic of China. This is what the Chinese people resolutely oppose.

　　We believe that refusing the People's Delegation of the People's Republic of China to participate in this conference of the Union is a major mistake in the history of the Union. In order to promote international peace and cooperation among the people of all countries, and in order to uphold the purpose of the Union, we hope that the Inter-Parliamentary Union can promptly correct this erroneous and illegal decision of the Executive Committee.

### 我国人民代表团主席彭真函各国议会联盟　抗议执委会阻挠我国参加联盟

　　我国人民代表团主席彭真函各国议会联盟
　　抗议执委会阻挠我国参加联盟
    新华社二十九日讯　中华人民共和国参加各国议会联盟的人民代表团主席彭真在八月二十八日写信给各国议会联盟理事会主席斯坦斯盖特勋爵和各国议会联盟第四十四届大会主席伦纳特·希尔加斯先生并请他们把这封信转给联盟执行委员会、理事会和联盟第四十四届大会，信的全文如下：
    斯坦斯盖特勋爵主席先生、伦纳特·希尔加斯主席先生并转联盟执行委员会、理事会和联盟第四十四届大会的全体女士们、先生们：
    我们很满意地注意到联盟有很多执行委员、很多理事、很多国家的议员代表先生们，都赞成和欢迎中华人民共和国人民代表团成为联盟会员；但是，联盟执行委员会竟以美国等少数委员的坚持反对，决定拖延中华人民共和国人民代表团参加联盟的问题，用以阻挠中华人民共和国人民代表团参加各国议会联盟。我认为，执行委员会的这一决定是完全违反联盟的宗旨和章程的，是非法的。我谨代表中华人民共和国参加各国议会联盟的人民代表团对此提出严正的抗议。
    尊敬的各位女士们、先生们，由于中国人民有热烈促进各国和平共处和友好合作的愿望，由于中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会在一九五五年二月曾通过决议，主张各国议会应担负起维护和巩固世界和平的重大责任，采取具体步骤发展各国人民的友好合作关系，中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会的代表们决定组织代表团参加各国议会联盟。我在本年七月二十四日就已经通知联盟各位负责人：中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会代表们已决定参加各国议会联盟。接着我们继续完成了加入联盟和出席本届大会的一切手续。联盟主席斯坦斯盖特勋爵和秘书长德布隆内先生都认为我们的手续是完备的，那末，联盟执委会根据什么理由决定延期讨论中国加入联盟的问题，用以拒绝中华人民共和国代表团参加联盟呢？显然，坚持反对中华人民共和国人民代表团参加联盟的人之所以这样做，不是要结束“冷战”，而是要继续进行“冷战”，不是要缓和国际紧张局势，而是要加剧国际紧张局势，不是要促进各国间的友好合作，而是要制造各国间的对立和分裂。他们因为得不到多数的支持，甚至表示，如果中国人民代表团参加联盟，他们和他们的朋友就要退出联盟。我在此愿意诚恳地奉告那些对中国抱着“有我无你”的轻率的敌对态度的先生们，六万万人民团结一致的中华人民共和国，是不会因为某些人厌恶它，诅咒它，这样拒绝它，那样否认它，就会从地球上消失而不存在的。我们既然居住在同一个地球上，那末，还是采取“有我无你”的态度呢？还是在平等互利的基础上彼此友好合作、和平共处呢？我们各国议员的责任是反映和实现选民的意志和愿望。我想大家最好还是冷静一点，按照全世界人民，特别是自己选民的愿望，采用和平协商的办法，面对面地坐下来商谈的好。如果美国议员先生们愿意面对真理，愿意真正代表美国人民的愿望和缓国际紧张局势和促进各国和平共处，那末，为什么不同中国人民代表坐在一起进行协商呢？历史会证明，坚持反对中国人民代表团参加联盟的企图最后是一定要失败的。
    一切公正的人士都会承认：只有中华人民共和国人民代表团能够代表中国参加各国议会联盟，但是，竟有人企图用暂时搁置我国代表团参加联盟的办法，来实现其所谓“两个中国”的阴谋。我在此郑重声明：关于任何“两个中国”的说法和做法，中国人民都是绝对不能容忍的。如果把中华人民共和国人民代表团参加各国议会联盟的问题同早已为中国人民所一致唾弃的蒋介石集团的所谓申请相提并论，或者用这样和那样的所谓“两个中国”的做法来处理中国参加联盟问题，实际上就是拒绝中国人民代表团参加联盟，就是干涉中国的内政，就是企图把联盟变成那些同六万万中国人民为敌、妄图颠覆中华人民共和国的好战分子的工具。这是中国人民坚决反对的。
    我们认为，拒绝中华人民共和国人民代表团参加本届联盟大会，是联盟历史上的一个重大的错误。为了促进国际和平和各国人民间的合作，为了维护联盟的宗旨，我们希望各国议会联盟能够及时改正执委会这个错误的和非法的决定。
            中华人民共和国参加各国议会
