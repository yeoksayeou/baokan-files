The Indian People's Struggle to Liberate Goa Will Surely Succeed
Hu Jin

On July 25th, Prime Minister Nehru announced in the Indian Parliament's People's Assembly that, due to Portugal's continued refusal to negotiate the Goa issue, the Indian government had decided to request Portugal to close its legation in New Delhi. At the same time, Prime Minister Nehru reiterated the Indian government's firm position, saying, "Goa is an indivisible part of India, and therefore, it is inevitable that it will become a part of the Indian Federation." This position and measure of the Indian government have received enthusiastic support from the people.

The People's Assembly's debate on the Goa issue fully reflected the Indian people's anger at Portugal's insistence on continuing to occupy Goa. The Indian people's just struggle to liberate Goa is gaining momentum with the active support and participation of members of parliament, various parties, and people from all walks of life.

The Indian government and people's just struggle to safeguard national territorial sovereignty possesses overwhelming moral force. Fair world opinion stands on the side of the Indian people.

India, having embarked on the road of independent development, cannot tolerate the continued violation and division of its territorial sovereignty; it is impossible for Portugal to stop this struggle of the Indian people. However, the Portuguese authorities still disregard the Indian government's expressed willingness to resolve the issue through peaceful negotiations, stubbornly continue to occupy Goa, and threaten India with war.

The Portuguese authorities' continuous statements demonstrate this point. In a statement issued on July 22nd, Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar blatantly threatened that Portugal would use "all its strength" to "defend" its colonial rule in Goa.

At the same time, the Portuguese colonial authorities have turned the entire Goa into a fascist armed camp, with tens of thousands of continuously reinforced military police suppressing the Goan people's liberation struggle there with torture, prisons, and bloody means. Volunteers who enter Goa in batches to support the Goa liberation movement have been subjected to extremely brutal attacks and persecution. The Portuguese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defense have both issued statements openly clamoring to use "forceful retaliation" and "severe suppression" to deal with the Indian people's patriotic movement.

But the Portuguese authorities must also see that violence alone cannot scare the Indian people and the Goan people, but will only provoke greater public outrage and resistance. Therefore, the Portuguese government played a trick. According to a July 4th AFP dispatch, the Portuguese government approved a decree to grant its "territories" in India so-called "administrative and financial autonomy," while the Portuguese Governor-General maintains the colonial rule as it is. The Portuguese government wants to use this colonialist "autonomy" trick to ease public opinion. However, the crux of the matter is that Portugal should return the Indian territory it forcibly occupied. And the Portuguese government issued a statement on this issue saying that it not only wants to maintain actual rule over Goa, Daman, and Diu, but also wants to extend its rule to other small areas that have been liberated by the Indian people. The statement "still considers" these areas as its "territory." Therefore, Indian newspapers pointed out sharply that this so-called plan to grant "autonomy" is worthless except to show that the Portuguese government recognizes that its colonial status in India is unstable.

Recently, the Portuguese government has also adopted another method. On July 23rd, the Portuguese Prime Minister's Office issued a formal statement stating that "Portugal has always been prepared to hold peaceful negotiations with India to seek a solution to the Goa issue on the basis of good neighborliness." Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar also said: "Let us understand each other." If these pleasant words are based on sincerity and realistic considerations, then Portugal and India will find a common ground for peacefully resolving the issue of Goa's return to India in accordance with the principles of respecting India's national sovereignty and territorial integrity. But this is not the case. When the Portuguese government is talking about negotiations, it repeatedly says: "Portugal cannot transfer its territories." Salazar himself even said: "If the 'Goa issue' is understood as a question of transferring the sovereignty of the Portuguese territory on the Indian peninsula to the Indian Federation, then this question will definitely not be resolved peacefully." This means that the peaceful negotiations sought by the Portuguese government are only to have India accept the fact that Portugal has invaded its territory.

The Portuguese government not only decided to continue to occupy Indian territory, but also distorted facts, reversed right and wrong, and slandered the Indian people's just struggle to recover Goa as implementing so-called "imperialist policies," and instead demanded that the Indian government "put into practice the principles of peaceful coexistence, respect for sovereignty, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries." However, it is a historical fact that Goa and other places were Indian territory before they were forcibly seized by Portugal. The Portuguese government cannot produce any evidence to prove that Goa and other places belong to Portuguese territory, so it is trying its best to make it seem as if it is not it that has violated India's territorial sovereignty, but that the Indian people are going to "violate Portuguese sovereignty"; it is not that it is unwilling to coexist peacefully with India on the basis of respecting India's territorial sovereignty, but that the Indian people's just struggle to recover their territory "endangers peace in Asia."

This kind of sophistry, of course, cannot change history and facts in the slightest, and it is precisely the usual trick of colonialists.

Of course, if no one were backing it up, the Portuguese government would not be so arrogant and domineering. Portugal dares to insist on continuing its colonial policy of occupying Goa mainly because it has the support of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Portugal has stated that Goa is land "within the scope of the North Atlantic Alliance" and can receive the "protection" of the alliance. As the Indian people's just struggle to liberate Goa rises, Portugal's situation becomes more and more embarrassing, and the supporting forces behind Portugal are becoming more and more apparent.

The "New York Times" commentary on July 26th insisted that "the India-Portugal conflict is out of emotion rather than practicality." The "New York Times" believes that Portugal's occupation of Goa "does not pose a threat to India in any way." Some British journalists even pulled out a treaty signed between Britain and Portugal in the fifteenth century from the dust of history, hinting that India should bear the treaty obligations of Britain's later recognition of Portugal's colonial rights in Goa, and agree that Portugal should continue to occupy Goa. Why are these propagandists so enthusiastic about this kind of propaganda with ulterior motives? Because Goa under Portuguese occupation is being transformed into a military base that threatens the security of India and other countries on the Asian continent, and is a colonialist stronghold of Western countries on the Asian continent.

Prime Minister Nehru refuted the Western bourgeois newspapers' propaganda with ulterior motives. He solemnly declared: "As far as independent India is concerned, it is not bound by any ancient or modern treaties between other countries." He also emphasized that Goa is not only a stronghold of the occupiers, but also a stronghold of many countries and many allies, which is a possible danger in the future. Therefore, for the sake of national unity and security, India cannot allow foreign countries to occupy strongholds in India.

The Indian people's just struggle to liberate Goa is bound to win. If the Portuguese government thinks that it can continue to occupy Indian territory, disregarding the just demands of the Indian people, by relying on the support of other countries, this plan is doomed to failure.

    印度人民解放果阿的斗争一定胜利
    胡今
    七月二十五日，尼赫鲁总理在印度国会人民院宣布：由于葡萄牙继续拒绝谈判果阿问题，印度政府决定要求葡萄牙关闭它驻新德里的公使馆。同时，尼赫鲁总理重申印度政府的坚定立场说：“果阿是印度不可分割的一部分，因而不可避免地一定要成为印度联邦的一部分。”印度政府的这个立场和这一措施，得到了人民的热烈支持。
    人民院关于果阿问题的辩论，充分反映了印度人民对葡萄牙坚持继续占领果阿的愤怒。印度人民争取解放果阿的正义斗争，在国会议员、各党派和各阶层人民的积极支援和参加下，正日益高涨起来。
    印度政府和人民争取国家领土主权完整的正义斗争，拥有压倒一切的道义力量。全世界公正舆论都站在印度人民的一边。
    走上了独立自主发展道路的印度，不能容忍它的领土主权继续被侵犯和分割；葡萄牙要阻挡印度人民的这一斗争是不可能的。但是，葡萄牙当局到现在还在不顾印度政府所表示的和平谈判解决的意愿，蛮横地继续霸占果阿，并对印度进行战争的威胁。
    葡萄牙当局连续发表的声明，表明了这一点。葡萄牙总理萨拉查在七月二十二日发表的声明中就露骨地威胁说，葡萄牙要用“全副力量”来“保卫”它在果阿的殖民统治。
    同时，葡萄牙殖民当局已经把整个果阿变成了
  一个法西斯武装兵营，源源增援的数以万计的军警，在那里以酷刑、监狱和血腥手段，镇压果阿人民的解放斗争。一批一批地进入果阿支持果阿解放运动的志愿人员，受到了非常残暴的攻击和迫害。葡萄牙外交部和国防部都曾发表声明，公然叫嚣要用“武力的回击”、“严厉的镇压”来对付印度人民的爱国运动。
    但是葡萄牙当局也不能不看到，单靠暴力行为吓不倒印度人民和果阿人民，只有引起更大的公愤和反抗。于是，葡萄牙政府玩弄了一个花样。据七月四日法新社电，葡萄牙政府批准了一项法令，决定给予葡萄牙在印度的“属地”以所谓“行政和财政的自治权”，而由葡萄牙总督维持原封不动的殖民统治。葡萄牙政府想用这种殖民主义者的“自治”把戏，缓和一下舆论。但是，问题的症结是葡萄牙应当归还它强占的印度领土。而葡萄牙政府就这一问题发表声明说，它不单要在果阿、达曼和第乌岛保持实际的统治权，而且还要把它的统治权扩展到已由印度人民解放的其他小块地区。声明“仍旧认为”这些地区是它的“领土”。因此，印度报纸尖锐地指出，这种所谓给予“自治”的计划除了说明葡萄牙政府承认了它在印度的殖民地位不稳固以外，是一文不值的。
    最近，葡萄牙政府还采取了另一手法。七月二十三日，葡萄牙总理办公厅发表正式声明，表示“葡萄牙一向准备同印度举行和平谈判，以谋求果阿问题在一种善邻的基础上得到解决”。葡萄牙总理萨拉查还说：“让我们互相谅解吧。”如果这些动听的言语是出于真诚和现实的考虑，那末葡萄牙和印度就会找到按照尊重印度国家主权和领土完整的原则和平解决果阿归还印度的问题的共同基础了。可是事实并不是这么一回事。葡萄牙政府在高谈谈判的时候，口口声声地说：“葡萄牙不能够移交它的属地”。萨拉查本人甚至说：“假如把‘果阿问题’了解为是一个把印度半岛上的葡属领土的主权移交印度联邦的问题，那末，这个问题肯定地将不会用和平的办法得到解决。”这就是说，葡萄牙政府所要的和平谈判，只是要印度接受葡萄牙侵占其国土的事实。
    葡萄牙政府不仅决定继续霸占印度的领土，而且歪曲事实，颠倒是非，诬蔑印度人民收回果阿的正义斗争是实行所谓“帝国主义政策”，反而要求印度政府“把和平共处，尊重主权和不干涉其他国家的内政的原则付诸实践”。但是，果阿等地在被葡萄牙武力夺取之前一直是印度的领土，这是个历史的事实。葡萄牙政府拿不出任何根据来证明果阿等地是属于葡萄牙的领土，因此它就竭力把事实说成好像不是它侵犯了印度的领土主权，而倒是印度人民要“侵犯葡萄牙主权”；不是它不愿在尊重印度领土主权的基础上同印度和平共处，而是印度收回自己的领土的正义斗争“使亚洲的和平遭到危险”。
    这种强词夺理的宣传，当然是丝毫也改变不了历史和事实的，而且正是殖民主义者惯用的手法。
    当然，如果不是有人为它撑腰，葡萄牙政府是不可能这样强横霸道的。葡萄牙所以敢坚持继续占有果阿的殖民政策，主要是凭恃有北大西洋公约集团的支持。葡萄牙曾声言果阿是“北大西洋联盟范围内的”土地，可以得到联盟的“保护”。随着印度人民解放果阿的正义斗争日益高涨，葡萄牙的处境日益窘迫，站在葡萄牙背后的支持力量，也就更加显露出来了。
    “纽约时报”七月二十六日的评论硬说：“印度—葡萄牙的冲突是出于感情而不是出于实际。”“纽约时报”认为，葡萄牙占领果阿，“在任何一点上来讲都没有给予印度以威胁”。英国的一些记者甚至从历史的灰尘中搬出英国和葡萄牙在十五世纪签订的条约来含沙影射，想叫印度承担英国在后来承认葡萄牙在果阿的殖民权的条约义务，同意葡萄牙继续占领果阿。为什么这些宣传家们如此热中于这种别有用心的宣传呢？因为，在葡萄牙侵占下的果阿正被变成为一个威胁印度和亚洲大陆其他国家的安全的军事基地，而且是西方国家在亚洲大陆上的一个殖民主义据点。
    尼赫鲁总理驳斥了西方国家资产阶级报纸的别有用心的宣传。他严正地声明：“就独立的印度来说，它根本不受其他国家之间的任何古代的或现代的条约的约束。”他并强调指出：果阿不仅是占有者的据点，而且是许多国家、许多盟国的据点，这是将来可能的危险。因此，为了国家的统一和安全，印度不能容许外国在印度占有据点。
    印度人民解放果阿的正义斗争是一定要胜利的。如果葡萄牙政府以为它依靠别国的支持能够不顾印度人民的正义要求而继续霸占印度的领土，这种打算是注定要破产的。
