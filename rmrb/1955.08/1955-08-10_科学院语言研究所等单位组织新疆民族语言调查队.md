The Xinjiang Ethnic Language Survey Team, jointly formed by the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Central University for Nationalities, and the Xinjiang Provincial People's Committee, began conducting language surveys in various parts of Xinjiang in late July to help ethnic minorities in Xinjiang develop their own languages and writing systems in the future. The survey team has four sub-teams: the Uyghur Language Survey Team, the Kazakh Language Survey Team, the Kyrgyz Language Survey Team, and the Mongolian Language Family Survey Team. These sub-teams will conduct language surveys for approximately four months in Kashgar, Turpan, Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, Kizilsu Kyrgyz Autonomous Prefecture, Bayingol Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture, and Bortala Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture.

The survey sub-teams will investigate the main dialect differences of the Uyghur language, understand the work of Uyghur script reform, and prepare for the study of the basic dialect of the Uyghur language. They will also investigate Kazakh and Kyrgyz dialects, understand the language work of the Kazakh and Kyrgyz people, and understand the main differences between the Kazakh and Kyrgyz languages in China and the Kazakh and Kyrgyz languages in the Soviet Union. They will also investigate the Oirat and Chahar dialects of the Mongolian language family in Xinjiang, as well as the Dagur language. If conditions permit, the survey team also plans to understand the language situation of the Xibe and Tajik ethnic groups, and to understand the opinions of the Xibe people on the future development of their ethnic script.

    各调查小队将分别调查维吾尔族语主要方言差别，了解维吾尔族文字改革工作情况，以便为研究维吾尔族语言基础方言作好准备；调查哈萨克族方言和柯尔克孜族方言，了解哈族、柯族语言工作情况，了解我国哈族、柯族语言和苏联哈萨克族、吉尔吉斯族语言的主要差别；调查新疆蒙古语族的沃依拉特、察哈尔方言和达乎尔语言。在条件许可下，调查队还准备了解锡伯族和塔吉克族语言情况，并在锡伯族人民中了解他们对本民族文字发展前途的意见。
