    On May 20th, this newspaper published an article titled "A 'Freely Mined' 'Open-Pit Coal Mine'," criticizing the Tangshan Municipal People's Committee for failing to actively offer advice to the Kailuan Coal Mine when it discovered that the Tangjiazhuang Mine was discarding gangue with a lot of coal, and instead using it to solve the livelihood problems of the poor, resulting in significant losses of state property. Now, the Tangshan Municipal People's Committee has sent a letter of self-criticism. The letter states that they have taken several measures to basically correct the aforementioned behavior of wasting state assets. The same problems existing in the Tangshan Mine have also been resolved.
