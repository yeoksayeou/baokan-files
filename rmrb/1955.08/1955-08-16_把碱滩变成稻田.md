    Turning Alkaline Land into Rice Paddies
    Luo Yazhu, Wang Xiusheng
    For hundreds of years, Niu Di Village in Yangyuan County, Hebei Province, has been surrounded by white, alkaline land. Now, in the southwest corner of this alkaline encirclement, over 300 mu of robust rice plants are growing. This is the rice paddy reclaimed by the Yongjin Agricultural Production Cooperative this spring.

    It is said that this place used to be a beautiful rice field. Due to the changing course of the Sanggan River and the exploitation and oppression by feudal landlords, this fertile land lost its irrigation and became alkaline. The alkalization increased year by year, turning it into the large area of alkaline land it is today. In recent years, with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, farmers have wanted to develop this wasteland to grow rice and other crops. To realize this wish, the village branch secretary, Li Wensheng, surveyed and studied the large area of wasteland south of the village many times, finally finding the places for water intake and drainage, and the location for the first batch of rice paddies to be reclaimed. His opinion was discussed and deliberated by the party members, and in July 1954, the Party General Branch Committee passed two resolutions: to dig a main canal and reclaim the first batch of rice paddies; to further develop mutual aid and cooperation organizations and establish an agricultural production cooperative.

    The Party branch's resolution was supported by the villagers, and soon a Yongjin Agricultural Production Cooperative with 210 households was established.

    After another period of preparation, on April 7th this year, the 12-li long main canal and all land leveling construction sites were filled with construction markers. Sixty to seventy cooperative members began to attack the alkaline land. After their dozens of days of hard work, all the projects were successfully completed by May 13th, and water began to be released. The floodwater flowed into the rice paddies along the main canal and various sluice gates.

    However, this is only the beginning of the village's victory and happiness. According to the plan of the village's Party branch, another 500 mu of rice paddies will be reclaimed in 1956, and 300 mu of滩地(tan di) land, after initial alkali suppression, can be planted with beans. In the second Five-Year Plan, they will use the floods from the Sanggan River and Hugou to turn the barren alkaline land into fertile farmland.

    把碱滩变成稻田
    罗亚儒　王秀生
    河北省阳原县的牛堤庄，被白花花的碱滩包围了几百年，现在，在这碱滩包围圈的西南角上，已生长起三百多亩茁壮的水稻，这就是永进农业生产合作社今春开垦的稻田。
    据说这里以前曾是一片美丽的稻田，由于桑干河的改道和封建地主的剥削压迫，使这块肥沃的土地失浇起碱，碱化地一年比一年地增多，变成了目前的大片碱滩。近几年来，随着互助合作运动的发展，农民就想开发这块荒滩耕种水稻和其它庄稼。为了实现这个愿望，乡支部书记李文生在村南的大片荒滩上踏勘和研究了好多次，终于找到了进水和出水的地方，找到可以开垦的第一批稻田的地点。他的意见经过党员的酝酿和讨论，一九五四年七月，党总支委员会通过了两条决议：开一条干渠，开垦第一批稻田；进一步发展互助合作组织，建立一个农业生产合作社。
    党支部的决议得到了全村农民的拥护，很快地便建立了一个二百一十户的永进农业生产合作社。
    又经过一个时期的准备以后，今年四月七日，十二里长的大干渠和所有整理土地施工点，都布满了施工的标记。六七十名社员，开始向碱滩进攻。经过他们几十天的辛勤劳动，到五月十三日全部工程胜利完工，并开始放水。洪水顺着干渠和各个分水门流进了稻田。
    但是，这仅仅是这个村胜利和幸福的开端，按照这村党支部的计划，一九五六年还要开垦五百亩稻田，三百亩滩地经过首次压碱，可以种上豆子。第二个五年计划里，他们要利用桑干河和虎沟的洪水，把寸草不长的碱滩都变成肥沃的良田。
