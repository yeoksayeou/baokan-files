    Over Ten Thousand Brooms Cannot Find Their Owner
    Editor:
    More than two months ago, Comrade Li, who was responsible for transshipment at the Fenglingdu office of the Jinnan Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shanxi Province, received more than 10,000 brooms transshipped from the Yellow River. The shipping note stated: "Transferred by Comrade Shang of the Baoji County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shaanxi; Received by Chen Yushan (i.e., the procurement agent of the Jinnan Special District Office stationed in Xi'an) of the Jinnan Special Cooperative."
    After seeing this batch of goods, Comrade Li immediately contacted the Special District Office by telephone and asked which county cooperatives should be allocated these brooms. The comrades at the Special District Office said that they had not received a forecast from Chen Yushan, the procurement agent stationed in Shaanxi, and would wait until they had inquired. Two days later, Chen Yushan's reply came, stating that he had not ordered brooms from the Baoji County Cooperative. The Special District Office then inquired with the Baoji County Cooperative, and Director Shang of the Baoji County Cooperative replied: "We have not transferred any brooms to Jinnan. You must have made a mistake!"
    Where did these more than 10,000 brooms come from? In order to clarify the facts, the Jinnan Office wrote to the Shanxi Provincial Cooperative to inquire, and contacted the Baoji County Cooperative again. As a result, the Shanxi Provincial Cooperative replied that they had not ordered this batch of brooms either, and the Baoji County Cooperative has not yet replied.
    This batch of unclaimed brooms has been piled up in the open air on the damp river beach; now that the wheat harvest season when farmers urgently need brooms has passed, most of the broom's fine leaves have rotted and are about to become waste products.

### 一万多把扫帚找不到主人

    一万多把扫帚找不到主人编辑同志：
    在两个多月以前，山西省供销合作社晋南专区办事处风陵渡负责转运的李同志收到了从黄河上转运来的一万多把扫帚，发货单上写着：“陕西宝鸡县供销社尚同志调拨；晋南专社陈玉山（即晋南专区办事处驻西安采购员）收。”
    李同志看到这批货物以后，立即打电话同专区办事处联系，并请示这批扫帚分配给那些县社。专区办事处的同志说是没有接到驻陕西采购员陈玉山的预报，要等问明白了再说。过了两天，陈玉山的回答来了，说他并没有向宝鸡县社订购过扫帚。专区办事处又向宝鸡县社查询，宝鸡县社的尚主任回答说：“我们没有往晋南调拨过扫帚，大概是你们弄错了吧！”
    这一万多把扫帚到底是那儿来的呢？晋南办事处为了查清事实，一面去信询问山西省社，一面再次和宝鸡县社联系。结果山西省社答复说他们也没有订购这批扫帚，宝鸡县社到现在还没有回复。
    这批无人认领的扫帚，一直露天堆放在潮湿的河滩边；现在农民急需用扫帚的麦收季节已经过去了，扫帚的细叶大部霉烂，将要变成废品了。
