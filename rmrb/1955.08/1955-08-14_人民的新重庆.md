    The New Chongqing of the People
    By Our Correspondent Ji Xichen

    Chongqing, the largest city in Southwest China, is a beautiful mountain city. On the peninsula-shaped mountains, amidst the evergreen trees, rows upon rows, layer upon layer of buildings and tile-roofed houses rise from the foot of the mountains all the way to the summit. The Yangtze and Jialing Rivers, converging here, resemble two silver-white ribbons, encircling this mountain city. In the morning, a gentle breeze blows from the river, and a light mist drapes over the picturesque hills like a soft gauze curtain. However, the most wonderful moment is in the evening: you can climb up Pipashan Mountain and see countless lights, like glittering stars, reflected in the rushing, undulating river. One million, seven hundred and sixty thousand people reside within this vast and beautiful urban area.

    Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chongqing had only several hundred thousand residents. In recent years, it has developed into a modern industrial city. Currently, the city has 300,000 workers, who, along with their families, account for more than half of the city's population. Among the many factories standing on both banks of the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers, there are heavy industry factories such as steel, coal, electricity, machinery manufacturing, and chemicals, which are necessary for the development of the national economy; there are also light and local industries that meet the needs of the people's lives. After the completion of the First Five-Year Plan, dozens of newly built and expanded large-scale industries will fundamentally change Chongqing's industrial landscape. After the open-hearth furnace of Chongqing Steel Plant was put into production, the city's steel production capacity increased by more than 13 times compared to 1950, changing the original imbalance between steelmaking and steel rolling, and enabling steelmaking capacity to catch up with the needs of steel rolling. The newly built state-owned Chongqing Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory produces 415,000 bolts of cloth annually, gradually changing the unreasonable situation in the past where cotton and cotton yarn were shipped out of the Southwest region and then cotton cloth was shipped back from other places. The 507 thermal power plant, newly built with Soviet assistance, and the Longxi River Hydropower Station, which is under large-scale construction, will form a huge power grid, ensuring sufficient power supply for industrial and civilian use. On the hillsides and in the valleys of the suburbs, the number of drilling rigs and derricks for exploring coal and oil mines is also increasing day by day.

    The working class of Chongqing has made brilliant contributions to the country's economic construction. On the eve of liberation, when the Chiang Kai-shek gang began a bloody massacre and ignited tons of explosives to destroy Chongqing, the workers broke through the pervasive smoke and fire and protected and rescued the factories with their lives; and with unparalleled labor enthusiasm, they restored and developed industrial production. The large amount of heavy steel rails and steel produced by the steel workers not only paved the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which the people of Sichuan had longed for for 40 years, but also strongly supported the construction of new railway lines across the country, factories and mines in various places, and the construction of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The emerging *Wu Bei Zi* plastic industry uses various products molded from *Wu Bei Zi* plastic, a specialty of the Southwest, which are widely used in electrical appliances, chemicals, and daily necessities, writing a new page in the history of China's chemical industry. The accordions, blankets, fluorescent lamps, and other products manufactured by Chongqing's local industry sell well throughout the country; a large number of threshers, water pumps, and new-style plows support agricultural production; moreover, many skilled workers in Chongqing were transferred to the Northeast and other places to support key construction projects, and hundreds and thousands of workers went to Tibet, Yunnan, and other places to participate in the construction of the motherland's borders.

    Chongqing is a hub of water and land transportation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and a distribution center for materials from the southwestern provinces. Relying on the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers, Chongqing connects the material exchanges between East China, Central and South China, and the rich Sichuan Basin. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which starts from Chongqing, connects the Qijiang Railway leading to the Guizhou border and the Baoji-Chengdu Railway leading to Shaanxi. The extensive highway network closely connects Chongqing with the southwestern provinces. Chongqing is also a huge inland river port, handling tens of thousands of tons of goods every day, with a constant stream of passengers in and out. Ships and tugboats traveling upstream on the Yangtze River against the turbulent currents transport steel ingots, drilling rigs, tractors, fertilizers, and industrial construction materials from Hankou, Shanghai, and other places, and then transfer them to the southwestern provinces via railways, highways, and rivers. More than 4,000 kinds of native products from the southwestern provinces, minerals such as antimony, tungsten, lead, and manganese produced in abundance on the Yunnan Plateau, and grain and medicinal materials from Sichuan are transported from here to all parts of the country. In terms of shipping volume alone, the current monthly volume is equivalent to the transportation volume of one year before liberation. In 1954, the volume of cargo handled by shipping increased by three and a half times compared with 1950.

    Chongqing has built many new schools and hospitals. This year, there are eight universities, 30 secondary technical schools, 39 ordinary middle schools, and 400 primary schools in the city. There are more than 220,000 primary and secondary school students, more than four times the number in the early days of liberation. In addition, more than 70,000 employees are studying in spare-time schools. In the past five years, more than 150,000 people in the city have been freed from illiteracy.

    Everywhere in the bustling urban area, there are scenes of construction changing with each passing day. New buildings have just been erected here, and the sound of rock blasting is heard there. Many of the workers who used to live in small bamboo sheds have moved into newly built dormitories. The narrow, steep, dirty and rotten docks of the past have become wide and clean today. The uneven roads have also been widened and leveled, and the slope has been reduced. Comfortable buses run all day long on the newly built and rebuilt trunk roads, which are more than 140 *li* long, and trolleybuses running across the city will soon be running in the mountain city. There are also many more places for working people to play and relax during holidays. There are nearly 40 entertainment venues in the city, including movie theaters that can accommodate more than 30,000 people at the same time. The newly built Labor People's Cultural Palace, Children's Palace, West Suburb Park, Pipashan Park, the huge gymnasium, and the Datianwan Square, which can accommodate 100,000 people, are all places for people to relax. In the scenic Nanwenquan, Beiwenquan, Jinyun Mountain, Huangshan and other places, the crowds of tourists are endless.

    In happy days, the people of Chongqing are particularly grateful to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for bringing happiness and hope to the people. The people still remember that in the dark and disastrous years before liberation, in order to strive for national peace, Chairman Mao came to Chongqing in person on August 25, 1945, and worked hard here day and night for 45 days. The site of the Eighteenth Group Army Office in Hongyan Village, Hualongqiao, where Chairman Mao lived at that time, and No. 50 Zengjiayan, where Premier Zhou Enlai lived when he represented the Communist Party in negotiations with the Kuomintang during the War of Resistance Against Japan, are now being built into revolutionary memorial halls. When people revisit these historically significant places, they will recall the arduous struggle waged by the party and the people's leaders in the past, and will think of the happy life of today and the future, thereby increasing their confidence and strength in building socialism and building a new Chongqing.

    人民的新重庆
    本报记者　纪希晨
    祖国西南的最大城市重庆，是一座美丽的山城。在形若半岛的山岭上，在四季常青的绿树丛中，一排排、一层层的楼房瓦屋，从山脚一直叠到山顶。汇合在这里的长江和嘉陵江，彷佛两条银白色的襟带，环绕这座山城。清晨，江面上吹来阵阵微风，薄雾像轻柔的纱帐披在秀丽的山岗上。然而最美好的时刻，还是在晚上：你登上枇杷山，可以望见数不尽的灯火，如同晶莹的繁星，倒映在奔流起伏的江水中。就在这辽阔而又美丽的市区内居住着一百七十六万人。
    抗战前，重庆只有几十万人口，近年来才发展成为一座现代的工业城市。现在，全市有工人三十万，连家属在内占全市人口一半以上。林立在长江和嘉陵江两岸的许多工厂中，有发展国民经济所必需的钢铁、煤矿、电力、机械制造和化学等重工业工厂；也有满足人民生活需要的轻工业和地方工业。在第一个五年计划实现以后，新建和扩建的几十个大型工业，将从根本上改变重庆的工业面貌。重庆钢铁厂平炉投入生产后，使全市钢的生产能力比一九五○年提高了十三倍多，改变了原来炼钢、轧钢的不平衡状态，使炼钢能力赶上了轧钢的需要。新建的国营重庆纺织印染厂，每年产布四十一万五千匹，使过去西南区运出棉花棉纱、然后再从外地运回棉布的不合理状态，逐渐得到了改变。在苏联帮助下新建的五○七火力发电站，和正在大规模兴建的龙溪河水力发电站，将组成一个巨大的输电网，保证工业和民用电力的充分供应。在郊区的山坡上，峡谷里，勘探煤矿、石油的钻探机和井架，也日益增多了。
    重庆工人阶级为国家经济建设作出了光辉的贡献。解放前夕，当蒋匪帮开始血腥屠杀，为毁灭重庆而点起数以千吨计的炸药时，工人们突破弥漫的烟火，用生命保卫、抢救了工厂；并以无比的劳动热情，恢复和发展了工业生产。钢铁工人制造的大量重型钢轨和钢材，不仅铺成了四川人民渴望四十年的成渝铁路，并有力地支援了全国铁路新线建设，支援了各地工厂、矿山，并且支援了越南民主共和国的建设。新兴的五棓子塑料工业，用西南的特产五棓子塑料压制成的各种产品，被广泛地运用于电器、化学和日用品中，为中国化学工业历史写下了新的一页。重庆地方工业制造的手风琴、毛毯、日光灯等畅销全国各地；大量的打谷机、抽水机、新式步犁支援了农业生产；不仅如此，重庆市的许多技术工人，曾被调往东北等地支援重点建设，有成百成千工人，到西藏、云南等地参加建设祖国边疆的工作。
    重庆是长江上游水陆交通的枢纽，是西南各省物资的集散地。重庆凭借长江和嘉陵江，沟通了华东、中南和富庶的四川盆地的物资交流。以重庆为起点的成渝铁路，连结通向贵州边境的綦江铁路和通向陕西的宝成铁路。四通八达的公路，使重庆和西南各省紧密联系起来。重庆又是巨大的内河港口，每天都吞吐成千上万吨的物资，进出川流不息的旅客。逆着汹涌的激流向长江上游行驶的轮船、拖驳，从汉口、上海等地运来了钢胚、钻探机、拖拉机、肥田粉和工业建筑器材，然后经由这里的铁路、公路和河流转运到西南各省。西南各省出产的四千多种土特产，云南高原盛产的锑、钨、铅、锰等矿产，四川的粮食和药材，又从这里输向全国各地。单以航运量计算，现在一个月就相当于解放前一年的运输量。一九五四年，航运货物吞吐量比一九五○年增加了三倍半。
    重庆新建了许多学校和医院。今年全市有高等学校八所，中等技术专科学校三十所，普通中学三十九所，小学四百所。中小学生二十二万多人，比解放初期增加了四倍多。此外尚有七万多职工在业余学校学习。五年来，全市扫除文盲十五万多人。
    繁闹的市区里，到处是日新月异的建设景象。这里刚刚修起一幢幢新的建筑物，那里又传来了开凿山岩的震响声。从前聚居在矮小竹棚里的工人，有许多都搬进新建的宿舍。往日窄陡脏烂的码头，今天已变得宽阔清洁了。高低不平的马路，也加宽修平，降低了坡度。新建和改建的一百四十多里干道上，舒适的公共汽车竟日奔驰，横贯全市的无轨电车，也很快就要在山城上行驶了。供劳动人民假期游玩和休憩的地方也增加了许多。全市娱乐场将近四十个，其中电影院就可同时容纳三万多人。市内新建的劳动人民文化宫、少年儿童宫、西郊公园、枇杷山公园，巨大的体育馆和可供十万人集会的大田湾广场，都是人们游憩的地方。风景优美的南温泉、北温泉、缙云山、黄山等地，游玩的人群络绎不绝。
    在幸福的日子里，重庆人民格外感念共产党和毛主席给人民带来幸福和希望。人民至今还记得，在解放前黑暗灾难的年月里，为着争取全国和平，毛主席在一九四五年八月二十五日亲来重庆，在这里日夜辛苦地工作了四十五天。当时毛主席住过的化龙桥红岩村前十八集团军办事处驻地，以及周恩来总理在抗日战争期间代表共产党同国民党谈判时住的曾家岩五十号等处，现在正在修建革命纪念馆。当人们重游这些有历史意义的地方时，便会回忆到党和人民的领袖们过去进行的艰苦卓绝的斗争，便会想到今天和今后的幸福生活，从而倍增建设社会主义、建设新重庆的信心和力量。更正
    八月十三日本报二版所载“‘中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划’出版”稿、第三栏第八段第二行的“四百二十万人”应为“四百二十二万人”。
    又，七月十七日本报一版所载“关于中华人民共和国兵役法草案的报告”第一段中的“并决议交由国务院发给，交全国各级人民委员会和广大人民讨论”一句，其中“，交”应删去。
