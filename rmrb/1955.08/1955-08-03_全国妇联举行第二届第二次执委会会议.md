Under the general task of the state during the transition period, and under the general guideline of women's work being "everything for good production and construction," the All-China Women's Federation conducted long-term and planned investigations and research on women's work in urban and rural areas. National rural and urban women's work conferences were successively held, greatly promoting the current women's work in rural and urban areas. In the past two years, the All-China Women's Federation has also achieved results in mobilizing women to participate in the state's central tasks, implementing the Marriage Law, and promoting childcare and maternal and child health. At the same time, the All-China Women's Federation has also carried out relatively extensive exchanges and friendly activities with women from various countries in coordination with the government's diplomatic activities. The meeting discussed the All-China Women's Federation's work plan for 1955. In 1955, the All-China Women's Federation will further strengthen urban and rural women's work, give play to the role of the broad masses of women in industrial and agricultural production, and in the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement; further strengthen the socialist ideological education and political and current affairs education of the masses of women, improve the political awareness of the masses of women, and strengthen the publicity of socialist moral principles in dealing with marriage, family, mothers and children to all sectors of society, continue to implement the Marriage Law and make it regularized; in addition, in accordance with the state's foreign policy, in coordination with the international work of defending peace, defending women's rights, and defending children's movement, strengthen the unity and friendship with women in Asian and African countries and other countries, to strengthen the international peace forces. Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, spoke at the meeting, pointing out the complexity, long-term nature, and arduousness of women's work, and especially criticizing the erroneous ideas that women's work is not important. She encouraged all executive committee members to work hard, mobilize and organize the broad masses of women to strive for the realization of the Five-Year Plan for socialist construction.
