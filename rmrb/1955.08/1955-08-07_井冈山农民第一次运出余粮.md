    Jinggangshan Peasants Transport Surplus Grain for the First Time
    For the first time, peasants in the old revolutionary base area of Jinggangshan, Jiangxi Province, transported surplus grain to support national industrial construction. As of July 1, they had transported over 106,000 jin of surplus grain.
      Jinggangshan was originally a barren mountainous area where the grain produced each year was not enough to eat. During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, Chairman Mao led the peasants in reclaiming wasteland, and they once managed to have enough to eat and even some to spare. After the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army went north to resist the Japanese, and the Kuomintang re-established their rule over Jinggangshan, the situation of insufficient grain returned to the mountains. By the time of liberation in 1949, Jinggangshan peasants were short 300,000 jin of grain and relied entirely on the government to transfer grain from the foot of the mountains for supply. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the peasants gradually organized themselves and actively developed production. By the spring of 1954, organized agricultural households in the entire area accounted for 85% of the total agricultural households, and the cultivated land area increased by more than 54%. In the autumn of 1954, the total grain output of the entire area reached more than 1.6 million jin, nearly doubling compared to 1949, fundamentally changing the grain shortage situation. Many households with surplus grain sold their surplus grain to the state. This spring, the peasants in the mountains launched a grain conservation campaign, and many households with surplus grain saved part of their grain to allocate to households with grain shortages, while households with grain shortages also voluntarily conserved and applied for reduced supplies. In this way, most of the grain stored in Jinggangshan was transferred down the mountain to support national construction.

    井冈山农民第一次运出余粮
    革命老根据地江西省井冈山区农民第一次运出余粮，支援国家工业建设。到七月一日止，已经运出余粮十万六千多斤。
      井冈山原是个土地荒瘠的山区，每年出产的粮食不够吃。在第二次国内革命战争时期，毛主席领导农民垦荒，曾一度做到有吃有余。工农红军北上抗日，国民党重新统治井冈山后，山上又恢复了粮食不够吃的情形。到一九四九年解放时，井冈山农民又缺口粮三十万斤，全靠政府从山下调粮供应。由于党和人民政府的正确领导，农民逐步组织起来，积极发展生产。一九五四年春，全区组织起来农业户占总农业户数百分之八十五，耕地面积增加了百分之五十四以上。一九五四年秋天，全区粮食总产量就达到一百六十多万斤，比一九四九年增加了近两倍，根本改变了缺粮现象，许多余粮户把余粮卖给了国家。今年春天，山上农民又开展了节约粮食运动，许多余粮户又节约出部分粮食调剂给缺粮户，缺粮户也主动节约申请核减供应。这样井冈山上的仓库存粮便大部调运下山支援国家建设。
