Xinhua News Agency, August 17th: Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China received the Japanese press and broadcasting delegation on the afternoon of August 17th.

The delegation, which was invited by the All-China Journalists Association to visit China, includes: Head of the delegation, Minoru Yokota (Vice President of "Sangyo Keizai Shimbun"); members Isao Kadota (member of the Foreign News Department of "Asahi Shimbun"); Yoshimori Tachibana (editorial writer for "Mainichi Shimbun"); Takeo Takagi (Deputy Director of the Editorial Bureau of "Yomiuri Shimbun"); Kenjiro Haryu (editorial writer for "Nihon Keizai Shimbun"); Yoshiro Yokota (Deputy Director of the Editorial Bureau of "Tokyo Shimbun"); Teiichi Suda (editorial writer for "Hokkaido Shimbun"); Mitsuru Suzuki (Director of the Editorial Bureau of "Chunichi Shimbun"); Junichi Okamoto (editorial writer for "Nishi Nippon Shimbun"); Toyoo Kuga (Chief of the Foreign News Bureau of Kyodo News); Shigeru Nakamura (Director of the Cultural Broadcasting Research Institute of NHK); Tsuneharu Suzuki (Director of the Research Bureau of Tokyo Broadcasting System); Suehiko Shiraishi (Director of the Tokyo branch office of Kyushu Broadcasting System); and delegation staff members Haruzo Mori and Akira Ishigami.

Premier Zhou Enlai provided written answers to the questions submitted by the delegation in advance. Then, the delegates raised some more questions, and Premier Zhou Enlai answered them one by one.

The delegates expressed their concern about strengthening the friendship between the people of China and Japan and promoting the normalization of relations between the two countries. Premier Zhou Enlai said in response that we have always believed that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully. In particular, China and Japan are neighbors, with a long history of peaceful and friendly coexistence for thousands of years, with only a few years not being so. People often say that China and Japan share the same culture. In principle, as long as we adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence put forward in the joint statement of the Prime Ministers of China and India, or the Ten Principles in the Declaration on Promoting World Peace and Cooperation of the Asian-African Conference, relations between China and Japan can be normalized, and the two countries can achieve true coexistence and co-prosperity.

Mr. Minoru Yokota said that they believe it is imperative to enhance the friendly relations between China and Japan, and this idea has been strengthened since arriving in China. However, some people in Japan still have misunderstandings about New China. After returning home, they will work hard to dispel these misunderstandings and enhance the friendship between the people of China and Japan.

In answering what the key to promoting the normalization of relations between China and Japan is, Premier Zhou Enlai said that the key lies in the governments of both countries conducting independent and autonomous diplomacy in the interests of the people to improve relations between China and Japan. Mr. Toyoo Kuga mentioned that the Chinese side has repeatedly taken positive and friendly attitudes towards improving relations between China and Japan, while the Japanese government has adopted a passive attitude. Therefore, judging from Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the Second Session of the National People's Congress and the statement by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on August 16, it seems that the Chinese side is dissatisfied with the Japanese government and expresses it with a stronger attitude. Premier Zhou Enlai agreed with this view. Premier Zhou Enlai said that the Chinese people and the government have extended a friendly hand to the Japanese people and the Japanese government for the past two years. We believe that the vast majority of the Japanese people, like the Chinese people, want friendship between China and Japan and the normalization of relations between the two countries. However, the Japanese government's expressions have not all been like this. In particular, recently, the Japanese government has adopted an attitude that is not sincere, which the Chinese people cannot be satisfied with. Premier Zhou Enlai said that dissatisfaction exists, but it does not prevent us from continuing to work to promote the normalization of relations between China and Japan, especially it does not prevent us from working to strengthen the friendly relations between the people of China and Japan. Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out that some people in Japan may feel that the Chinese side is eager to normalize relations between China and Japan, so the Japanese government can raise more unreasonable demands to make things difficult for the Chinese government. Premier Zhou Enlai said that this idea is wrong. The question is not who is anxious and who is not, but whether or not relations between China and Japan should be normalized. The Chinese government is committed to improving relations between China and Japan because it is beneficial to the people of both countries and beneficial to peace in the Far East and the world. At present, the state of war between China and Japan has not ended, which is detrimental to the people of both countries, the Far East, and world peace. The normalization of relations between China and Japan is a matter that benefits both China and Japan and should be done by both sides, not just regarded as the affair of one side.

Mr. Minoru Yokota said that he completely agreed with Premier Zhou on this point, and as people in the Japanese press and broadcasting industry, they can do more of what they should do.

Someone mentioned the Japanese compensation issue in the statement of the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and hoped that Premier Zhou Enlai would explain it. Premier Zhou Enlai said that the statement of the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs mentioned the huge losses suffered by the Chinese people during the Japanese militarist war of aggression against China. The Japanese government has never accounted for this. On the contrary, judging from many remarks by the Japanese authorities, it seems that China owes Japan a lot and should give some account. The spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs raised this point, stating that the Chinese people have the right to demand compensation, which should attract the attention of the Japanese government.

Premier Zhou Enlai said in his written answer to the third question that "Any sincere effort towards the normalization of relations between China and Japan should lead to the abolition of the Japan-Chiang Treaty." Mr. Yoshimori Tachibana then asked whether this could be understood as: the abolition of the Japan-Chiang Treaty is not necessarily a prerequisite for promoting the normalization of relations between China and Japan, but rather a goal and result of promoting the normalization of relations between China and Japan. Premier Zhou Enlai said that it can be understood roughly in this way.

The delegates also mentioned the issue of Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal at the Second Session of the National People's Congress to conclude a collective peace treaty in the Asian and Pacific regions. Someone asked how the concretization of this proposal would be. Premier Zhou Enlai said that the issue of concluding a collective peace treaty in the Asian and Pacific regions needs to be concretized based on the development of the situation. It is conceivable to convene such a meeting, with participants not only from Asian countries, but also from countries along the Pacific coast, including countries in the Americas and Australia. The key to convening such a meeting lies in the improvement of Sino-US relations and Sino-Japanese relations. This requires the joint efforts of the parties concerned, through consultation, to gradually resolve the existing international disputes. In this way, the hope of concluding a collective peace treaty in the Asian and Pacific regions exists.

Mr. Minoru Yokota said that the Japanese people very much agree with the convening of such a meeting to conclude a collective peace treaty in the Asian and Pacific regions, and it can be said that the Japanese people unanimously support it.

The delegates also mentioned the significance of friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Japanese press for enhancing the friendship between the people of China and Japan and promoting the normalization of relations between China and Japan. Premier Zhou Enlai hoped that this visit to China by the Japanese press and broadcasting delegation would play a good role in this regard.

Mr. Minoru Yokota said, we also hope that the Chinese press can send a delegation to visit Japan as soon as possible.

Mr. Minoru Yokota also said that after this visit to China by the Japanese press and broadcasting delegation, publishing impressions of visiting New China will definitely help promote the friendship between the people of China and Japan. Premier Zhou Enlai also hoped that after the delegation returns to Japan, it will provide comprehensive, well-intentioned, and critical reports on what it has seen and heard in China to enhance mutual understanding between the people of China and Japan.

Premier Zhou Enlai finally wished the Japanese press and broadcasting representatives new achievements in promoting the friendship and cooperation between the people of China and Japan and the normalization of relations between China and Japan.

Premier Zhou Enlai's reception lasted from 5:30 PM to 7:15 PM.

Also present at the reception were: Li Dequan, President of the Red Cross Society of China, Liao Chengzhi, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Lei Renmin, Vice Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Qiao Guanhua, Vice President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, Chen Jiakang, Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs, Gong Peng, Director of the Information Department, Yang Gang, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of People's Daily, Wu Lengxi, Mei Yi, and Wang Yunsheng, Vice Presidents of the All-China Journalists Association, and Zhang Jiming, Deputy Secretary-General.

    周恩来总理接见日本新闻界
    广播界访华代表团的经过情形
    新华社十七日讯　中华人民共和国国务院周恩来总理，在八月十七日下午接见了日本新闻界广播界访华代表团。
    受接见的代表团是应中国新闻工作者联谊会的邀请来中国访问的，它包括团长横田实（“产业经济新闻”社副社长），团员门田勋（“朝日新闻”外报部部员）、橘善守（“每日新闻”社论委员）、高木健夫（“读卖新闻”编辑局次长）、针生健次郎（“日本经济新闻”社论委员）、横田芳郎（“东京新闻”编辑局次长）、须田祯一（“北海道新闻”社论委员）、铃木充（“中部日本新闻”编辑局长）、冈本顺一（“西日本新闻”社论委员）、久我丰雄（共同通讯社外信局长）、中村茂（日本广播协会文化广播研究所长）、铃木恒治（东京广播台调查局长）、白石末彦（九州广播台东京支社社长），以及代表团工作人员森春造、石上韶。
    周恩来总理对代表团预先提出的问题作了书面答复。然后，代表们又提出了一些问题。周恩来总理也一一作了答复。
    代表们对加强中日两国人民友好和促进中日两国关系正常化表示关切。周恩来总理在回答问题时说，我们一贯认为不同社会制度的国家是可以和平共处的。尤其是中国和日本是近邻，几千年来有着长时期的和平友好相处的历史，其间只有少数年份不是这样。人们常爱说中日两国同文同种。照理，只要根据中国和印度两国总理联合声明中所提出的和平共处五项原则，或者说根据亚非会议的促进世界和平和合作的宣言中的十项原则，中日两国的关系就能够正常化，中日两国就能够达到真正的共存共荣。
    横田实先生说，他们认为非增进中日两国友好关系不可，到了中国以后，这种想法更加强了。但是日本人中还有一部分人对新中国有误解。他们回去之后要努力摒除这种误解，增进中日两国国民的友好。
    在回答促进中日两国关系正常化的关键何在时，周恩来总理说，关键在于两国政府都应根据人民的利益，进行独立自主的外交，来改进中日两国的关系。久我丰雄先生提到，中国方面曾多次对改进中日两国关系采取积极的友好的态度，而日本政府却采取消极的态度。因此，从周恩来总理在全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言和八月十六日外交部发言人的声明看来，似乎表示中国方面对日本政府有所不满，而且以较强烈的态度表现出来。周恩来总理表示同意这种看法。周恩来总理说，中国人民和政府两年来向日本人民和日本政府伸出友好的手。我们相信，绝大多数日本人民正如中国人民一样是要求中日两国友好、要求两国关系正常化的。但是，日本政府的表示却并不都是这样。特别是最近，日本政府采取了不是诚意的态度，这是中国人民不能满意的。周恩来总理说，不满意是存在的，但并不妨碍我们继续为促进中日两国关系正常化而努力，尤其是并不妨碍我们为加强中日两国人民友好关系而努力。周恩来总理指出，日本方面可能有人觉得，中国方面急于使中日两国关系正常化，因此日本政府可以多提些无理的要求，同中国政府为难。周恩来总理说，这种想法是错误的。问题不在于谁急谁不急，而在于应该不应该促进中日两国关系正常化。中国政府之所以致力于改进中日两国关系，是因为这样做对中日两国人民有利，对远东和世界和平有利。目前中日两国之间的战争状态还没有结束，这对于两国人民、远东和世界和平都是不利的。中日两国关系的正常化，是对中国和日本两方面都有利的事情，应该双方来做，而不应该只看作是一方面的事。
    横田实先生说，这一点同周总理完全有同感，作为日本的新闻界广播界人士，可以多做应该做的事。
    有人提到中国外交部发言人声明中谈到日本赔偿问题，希望周恩来总理加以说明。周恩来总理说，外交部发言人声明中提到了中国人民在日本军国主义侵华战争中遭受巨大的损失。关于这点，日本政府从未作过交代。相反的，从日本当局的许多言论看来，倒好像中国欠了日本许多东西，应作什么交代似的。中国外交部发言人提出这点，说明中国人民有权要求赔偿，应该引起日本政府注意。
    周恩来总理在书面答复第三个问题时曾说，“任何对于中日关系正常化的真诚努力，都应该导致日蒋和约的废除”。橘善守先生因而问，这是否可以理解为：日蒋和约的废除，不一定是促进中日两国关系正常化的前提，而是促进中日两国关系正常化的目标和结果。周恩来总理说，大体上可以这样理解。
    代表们还提到周恩来总理在全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言中建议缔结亚洲和太平洋地区的集体和平公约的问题。有人问这个建议的具体化怎样。周恩来总理说，关于缔结亚洲和太平洋地区的集体和平公约问题，要根据形势的发展才能具体化。可以设想召开这样的会议，参加者不仅有亚洲各国，还有太平洋沿岸的各国，包括美洲和澳洲的国家。要召开这样的会议，关键在于中美关系和中日关系的改进。这就需要有关方面的共同努力，经过协商途径，逐步解决目前存在的国际争端。这样，缔结亚洲和太平洋地区的集体和平公约的希望是存在的。
    横田实先生表示，日本人非常赞成召开这样的会议，来缔结亚洲和太平洋地区的集体和平公约，可以说日本人是全体一致支持的。
    代表们也提到中日两国新闻界的友好往来对于增进中日两国人民友好和促进中日两国关系正常化的意义。周恩来总理希望日本新闻界广播界代表团这次访问中国，在这方面将起良好的作用。
    横田实先生说，我们也希望中国新闻界派代表访问日本能早日实现。
    横田实先生还说，这次日本新闻界广播界访华代表团回去之后，发表访问新中国的观感，对促进中日两国国民的友好一定有帮助的。周恩来总理还希望代表团回日本后，能对在中国的所见所闻，作出全面的善意的带有批评性的报道，以增进中日两国人民的相互了解。
    周恩来总理最后祝日本新闻界广播界代表们在促进中日两国人民友好合作和中日两国关系正常化方面有新的成就。
    周恩来总理的接见自下午五时三十分起到七时十五分结束。
    接见时在座的有：中国红十字会会长李德全，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席廖承志，中国国际贸易促进委员会副主席雷任民，中国人民外交学会副会长乔冠华，外交部部长助理陈家康、新闻司司长龚澎，人民日报副总编辑杨刚，中国新闻工作者联谊会副会长吴冷西、梅益、王芸生，副秘书长张纪明。（附图片）
