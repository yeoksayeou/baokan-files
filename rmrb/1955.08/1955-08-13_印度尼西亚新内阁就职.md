Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 12th: The new Indonesian cabinet led by Prime Minister Burhanuddin Harahap was sworn in at the State Palace on the morning of the 12th, with Indonesian Vice President Hatta administering the oath. With the exception of the Minister of Education and Culture and the Minister of Public Works, which are reserved for the Greater Indonesia Party, all the new ministers of the various ministries attended the ceremony. Former Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo and his ministers, as well as many senior government officials, also attended the ceremony.

According to the Indonesian News Agency, Prime Minister Burhanuddin Harahap said when meeting with reporters that the new cabinet will immediately study the preparations for the general election made by the previous cabinet in order to determine whether the election can begin on September 29th. He also said that his cabinet will not be in power for a long time, as it will automatically resign immediately after the new parliament elected in the general election holds its first meeting. Therefore, it is not possible to expect great improvements in the country's general situation in the short term.

The Greater Indonesia Party has nominated Suwandi as Minister of Education and Culture, but a final decision has not yet been made on the candidate for Minister of Public Works.

    印度尼西亚新内阁就职
    新华社雅加达十二日电　伯汉努丁·哈拉哈普总理领导的印度尼西亚新内阁十二日上午在国家宫宣誓就职，由印度尼西亚副总统哈达监誓。除了为大印度尼西亚党保留的文教部长和公共工程部长之外，所有各部的新部长都参加了仪式。前任内阁的总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约和部长们以及许多政府高级官员也参加了仪式。
    据印度尼西亚新闻社报道，伯汉努丁·哈拉哈普总理在接见记者时说，新内阁将马上研究前任内阁进行的普选准备工作的情况，以便确定选举是否可以在九月二十九日开始举行。他又说，他的内阁将不会长期执政，因为它将在普选后选出的新国会举行第一次会议后立即自行卸任，因此不可能期望在短时期内对国家的一般情况有很大的改进。
    大印度尼西亚党已经提名苏旺迪为文教部长，但是，对公共工程部长的人选还没有作出最后的决定。
