Children's Outstanding Creations
    --Introduction to the National Children's Science and Technology and Craft Works Exhibition
    By our reporter Bai Sheng
    The National Children's Science and Technology and Craft Works Exhibition is about to open tomorrow in the Cultural Hall of the Soviet Exhibition Center in Beijing.
    Nearly a thousand exquisite and excellent works made by the children themselves are displayed in the exhibition. There are various models, instruments, specimens, and handicrafts, all of which fully demonstrate the children's rich wisdom and creative talents. These exhibits were transported to Beijing from all over the motherland, and the authors include more than a dozen ethnic groups in our country, most of whom are elementary and junior high school students between the ages of nine and fifteen.
    The entire exhibits are divided into four parts: natural geography, physics, biology, and crafts.
    In the natural geography exhibits, we first see the various exquisite map models made by the children. Here are the topographic model of the great motherland, the topographic model of Taiwan, which concretely and vividly expresses the children's love for the motherland and their determination to liberate Taiwan, and also reflects the children's rich knowledge of the geography of the motherland. Also exhibited here are models of many great constructions of the motherland such as the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, the Guanting Reservoir, and the Haizhou Open-pit Coal Mine. The Natural Science and Technology Group of Taiping Complete Primary School in the Haizhou Open-pit Mining Area made a very detailed and realistic model of the Haizhou Open-pit Coal Mine. This science group is composed of thirteen Young Pioneers. This embodies their love for the great construction of the motherland and their love for the cause that their fathers and brothers are engaged in for life.
    Among the exhibits, there are also two outstanding models of "meteorological stations." One is an ideal meteorological station model of "We hope to have such a meteorological observation field" made by the Meteorological Observation Group of Yimiao District Central Primary School in Shanghai. This model has been identified by meteorological scientists as being precisely made. In front of the model, there are also stacks of newspaper notebooks, which are the records of daily meteorological observations made by this meteorological observation group since its establishment in July 1951 until now. For four years, regardless of sunny or rainy days, whether it was winter or summer vacation, the members of this group took turns to take on the measurement and recording work, and this record has never been interrupted for a day. This meteorological observation group is now led by Li Yifu, a girl who is only eleven years old. She has been working very conscientiously and responsibly since she joined this meteorological observation group in 1954. Another meteorological station model was made by six fourth-grade children from Jixi Miner's Children's Primary School in Heilongjiang. This meteorological station is also quite accurate and beautiful.
    The electric model of the oil exploitation process made by Zhao Hailu and other six elementary school students from the Xidan First Central Primary School in Beijing is also a very attractive exhibit for the audience.
    It can also be seen that the children have gained knowledge of the rich underground resources of the motherland from geography lessons, so exploring the underground treasures of the motherland is also a career that the children aspire to and love. In the many mineral and fossil specimens collected by the children on display, we see that the types of various ores collected by the children are so many, including granite, limestone, coal, mica... and various biological fossils, such as ancient trilobite fossils, fish fossils, shell fossils, and Dimetrodon fossils. These mineral and fossil specimens are the trophies of the children's field exploration work, which enriches the children's knowledge of the underground resources of the motherland.
    The exhibits in the physics section of the exhibition are the most attractive to people. Here are displayed many mechanical models made by children using electricity, water power, wind power, and steam, as well as various instruments and physical models made using the principles of optics and radio. These exhibits illustrate the children's deep interest in physics and creative talents.
    Tang Huizhang and other four children from the junior high school of Shanghai Nanyang Model Middle School saw electric trains in magazines and at the Soviet Exhibition and had the desire to make an electric locomotive. After hard work and cooperation, they finally succeeded in making a model of an electric locomotive. As long as the switch is turned on, this electric train can turn non-stop, the locomotive will also whistle, and when it arrives at the platform, the railway staff on the platform can automatically direct the locomotive, and when the train body passes through the tunnel and over the bridge, the signal lights can also automatically light up.
    Many crane and excavator models, large and small, placed on the exhibition stand can be operated and moved. A large electric crane model looks exactly like a real crane. After being energized, the heavy body and extended arm can be freely rotated and raised. Among the exhibits, there is an electric tractor, and when you press the button, it can run in the field without being driven by people. This exhibit was made by the Juvenile Science Research Group of the Third Complete Primary School in Chengguan Town, Heze, Shandong.
    On a large exhibition stand, there are more than a dozen different types of ship models of various sizes. Here are warships, submarines, passenger ships... Some ships can sail in the water after being equipped with batteries. The little masters who made them mostly live in coastal areas of our country such as Qingdao, Fuzhou, Shanghai, etc. They have loved the ocean of the motherland since they were young and want to be a heroic naval warrior or navigator who defends the ocean of the motherland when they grow up.
    The many camera, projector, telescope and microscope models made by the children themselves are even more touching and lovely. Those small cameras, which do not look very beautiful but are very cute, can all take clear pictures; the photos taken by them are also exhibited on the exhibition stand. There is a very eye-catching Newtonian telescope that can observe the mountains on the moon and the planets of the solar system. The lenses of this telescope were made by two children themselves.
    Children love aviation models very much. In the exhibited aviation model works, we can see the children's yearning for the aviation industry of the motherland. They have made various styles of aircraft models: jet aircraft, large transport aircraft, passenger aircraft and towing gliders. The models of several aircraft made by Xu Peizhi, a student of the 246th Primary School in Taiyuan City, and Weng Rongguang, a junior high school student of the Fourth Middle School in Taiyuan, are particularly exquisite. Zheng Long, a student of Beijing No. 3 Girls' Middle School, also designed and made a large gasoline-powered aircraft model himself. This aircraft can perform stunts such as somersaults and side flying. A group of Young Pioneers from the Affiliated Middle School of South China Normal College in Guangzhou also manufactured their ideal rocket model.
    In the physics exhibits, we can also see many exquisite crystal radio and radio receivers made by the children themselves. Ye Linlin, a fourteen-year-old student from Shanghai Private Yucai Middle School, installed a one-tube, clever little radio receiver in a small blue chemical soap box. Now he is also preparing to make a five-tube radio receiver!
    Children's love for nature is specifically manifested in their research on biological sciences. On display are many biological specimens collected and made by the children themselves; many excellent varieties and new varieties cultivated and hybridized by the Michurin Group are also on display at the conference.
    Among the various animal specimens, the most attractive are those macerated specimens that study the life history of animals. Here are specimens of the life history of earthworms made perfectly, and specimens of the development process of frogs, chickens, and rabbits. Professors from the Department of Zoology of Peking University praised the specimens made by the children, which are no less than those animal specimens in their university laboratory!
    At the exhibition, we can see that the sunflower seeds grown by the Michurin Group of Xiajiang Township Primary School in Yuqian County, Zhejiang Province have surprisingly large grains. The winter wheat No. 2419 cultivated by the junior high school students of Shanghai Middle School in Shanghai has large grains and high yield, with an average yield of 4.06 dan per mu. The children organized many Michurin groups to carry out research work on plant science. After listening to the book "Michurin's Good Student," Ren Guoying, a fourth-grade girl from Xuying Complete Primary School in Yuanyang County, Henan, pollinated the pollen of cantaloupe to the pistil of zucchini, and finally grew a large melon weighing three kilograms. The melon tasted like cantaloupe and had the shape of zucchini.
    After seeing the children's scientific and technological exhibits, and then seeing the rich and colorful handicrafts made by the children, you will feel more and more that the children are versatile. There are various exquisite styles of embroidery, weaving, paper-cutting, bamboo work, woodwork, clay work, sculpture, musical instruments, and toys. These works fully demonstrate the children's artistic talent and also reflect their beautiful and happy life and ideals.
    Among the craft exhibits, the works of children in various ethnic minority areas of our country are particularly noteworthy. Many exquisite embroideries, sculptures, and musical instruments are made by their skillful little hands. Such as the embroidered flower belts, purses, and flower shoes made by Yi children, the wax embroidery of Guizhou minority children, the embroidered hats made by Uyghur children, and the Matouqin musical instruments made by Mongolian children, and the Lusheng musical instruments made by Miao children. On the exhibition stand, there is a sculpture that attracts people's attention, "A Kazakh Child Driving Sheep in a Storm," which was sculpted by Debao, a Xibe child in the fourth grade of Xinjiang Military Region Primary School. He sculpted the vivid image of a Kazakh child riding a galloping horse in a heavy snowstorm.
    In a huge painting of "Peace Fortress - Moscow Beijing" pasted with broken eggshells, we see the children's unique artistic creation; the work also expresses the children's rich feelings for the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union and their determination to defend world peace. The right side of this paper-cut is the solemn and magnificent Tiananmen Square, and the left side is the tall and majestic Kremlin, with a flat avenue connecting them in the middle. Above the paper-cut, a group of beautiful white doves are flying freely in the blue sky. This work was created by the students of the First Complete Primary School of Shenyang Railway.
    The children's woodwork, paper work, clay work, weaving, and sewing are also very exquisite and lovely. They made complete sets of dollhouse furniture and sewed many beautiful cloth dolls. The various straw hats, baskets, baskets, and lace woven by the children with horsetail grass, willow branches, rattan branches, and cotton thread are very exquisite and have their own styles. The exhibition stand also specially displays several vivid stone prints of small animals carved by Qiao Dayu, a seven-year-old child. The images are very simple and cute.
    When you have finished looking at these outstanding creations of the children, whether they are science and technology works or handicrafts, you will be amazed at how rich the children's wisdom is. The children's creations not only demonstrate their talents, but also demonstrate the country's love and education for them, and demonstrate their happy life. The children's talents and wisdom have gained unprecedented development in the happy New China, and their lofty ideals will bloom like beautiful flowers in the great cause of socialist construction of the motherland.

    孩子们出色的创作
    ——全国少年儿童科学技术和工艺作品展览会介绍
    本报记者　柏生
    全国少年儿童科学技术和工艺作品展览会，明天就要在北京苏联展览馆文化馆开幕了。
    展览会里陈列了孩子们亲手制作的近一千件精致优秀的作品，这里有各种模型、仪器、标本和工艺品，所有这些展品都充分地显示了孩子们丰富的智慧和创造才能。这些展品是从祖国各地运到北京来的，作者包括我国十几个民族，他们大都是九岁到十五岁之间的小学和初中的学生。
    整个的展品是分成自然地理、物理、生物和工艺品四个部分展出的。
    在自然地理的展品中，我们首先看到的是孩子们制作的各种精致的地图模型。这里有伟大祖国地形模型，有台湾地形模型，具体而生动地表现了孩子们热爱祖国，坚决解放台湾的意志和信心，也体现了孩子们对祖国地理的丰富知识。在这里展出的还有荆江分洪、官厅水库、海州露天煤矿等许多祖国伟大建设的模型。海州露天矿区的太平完全小学自然科学技术小组制作一个十分细致真切的海州露天煤矿的模型。这个科学小组是由十三名少年先锋队员组成的。这里体现了他们对祖国伟大建设的热爱，对他们父兄终身从事的事业的热爱。
    在展品中还有两座出色的“气象台”的模型。一座是上海市邑庙区中心小学测候小组制作的“我们希望有这样一个气象观测场”的理想的气象台模型。这座模型经气象科学工作者鉴定，认为制作精确。在模型的前面，还放着几叠报纸本子，是这个测候小组从一九五一年七月成立以来，直到现在的每天观测气象的记录。四年来，不论天晴、阴雨，不论寒假、暑假，这个小组的组员们都分别轮流担任测量记载工作，这种记录从未间断过一天。这个测候小组现在是由一个年龄只有十一岁的女孩李忆馥领导的，她从一九五四年参加这个测候小组起，工作一直非常认真负责。另外一座气象台模型是黑龙江鸡西矿工子弟小学校四年级的六个孩子制作的，这座气象台也相当精确、美观。
    北京西单第一中心小学赵海禄等六个小学生制作的石油开采过程的电动模型也是十分吸引观众的一件展品。
    还可以看出，孩子们从地理课里得到了对祖国丰富的地下资源的知识，因而发掘祖国的地下宝藏，也是孩子们憧憬的和热爱的一种事业。在陈列的许多孩子们采集的矿物、化石标本中，我们看到孩子们收集来的各种矿石种类是那么多，这里有花岗石、石灰石、煤、云母……还有各种生物的化石，像古代的三叶虫化石、鱼类化石、贝壳化石、盘龙化石等。这些矿物和化石标本是孩子们从事野外发掘工作的胜利品，它丰富了孩子们对祖国地下资源的知识。
    展览会的物理部分的展品是最吸引人们注意的。这里陈列着孩子们制作的利用电力、水力、风力和蒸汽发动的许多机械模型，以及利用光学、无线电学原理制作的各种仪器和实物模型。这些展品说明了孩子们对物理学的深厚兴趣和创造才能。
    上海南洋模范中学初三学生唐辉章等四个小朋友，从杂志上和苏联展览会上看到了电气小火车，就产生了制作一辆电气机车的愿望。经过努力合作，他们终于制作成功了电气机车的模型，这座电气火车只要开动开关，立刻就能不停地转动，机车还会叫，到月台时，月台上的铁路员工能自动指挥机车，车身通过隧道过桥时，信号灯也能自动亮起来。
    放在展览台上的大大小小的许多起重机和掘土机的模型都可以操纵和活动。一架大型电动起重机的模型，样子完全像一架真的起重机，通电后，沉重的机身和伸出臂都可以自由的转动和升起。在展品中有一架电动拖拉机，当你一按电钮，它就可以在田野里奔驰，而用不着人来驾驶。这件展品是山东菏泽城关镇第三完全小学少年科学研究小组制作的。
    在一个大展览台上，放着十几只不同种类的大小船舰模型。这里有军舰、潜水艇、客轮……有些船舰装上电池后，能在水里航行。制作它们的小主人，大都是生活在我国沿海地区如青岛、福州、上海等城市里，他们从小就喜爱祖国的海洋，想长大以后做一名保卫祖国海洋的英雄的海军战士或航海家。
    孩子们亲手制作的许多照像机、幻灯机、望远镜和显微镜的模型更是非常感人和可爱。那些外表看来并不十分美观，但十分可爱的小照像机都能拍照出清晰的照片来；用它拍出的照片也一同在展览台上展出了。有一架十分引人注目的牛顿式的天文望远镜，可以观测月球上的山脉和太阳系的行星，这个望远镜的镜头是两个孩子自己磨出来的。
    孩子们对航空模型更是非常喜爱的。在展出的航空模型作品中，我们可以看出孩子们对祖国航空事业的向往。他们制作了各种式样的飞机模型：喷气式飞机、大型运输机、客机和牵引滑翔机。太原市二四六小学学生许培智和太原第四中学初一学生翁榕光制作的几架飞机的型式特别精美。北京市女三中学生郑珑还自己设计制作了一架大型汽油动力的飞机模型，这架飞机可以作翻筋斗、侧飞等特技表演。广州华南师范学院附中的一群少年先锋队员还制造了他们理想的火箭模型。
    在物理展品中，我们还可以看到孩子们亲手制作的许多精巧的矿石收音机和无线电收音机。十四岁的上海私立育材中学的学生叶琳琳，在一个小小蓝色的化学肥皂盒里，装制了一架一个灯的灵巧的小无线电收音机，现在他还准备做一架五个灯的收音机呢！
    孩子们对大自然的爱好，具体地表现在他们对生物科学的研究上。在展品中陈列了许多孩子们自己采集和制作的生物标本；有许多米丘林小组培植、杂交出来的优良品种和新品种的实物也在会上展出了。
    在各种动物标本中，最吸引人的是那些研究动物生活史的浸制标本。这里有制作完美的蚯蚓生活史的标本，有青蛙、鸡和兔子的发育过程的标本。北京大学动物系的教授们赞叹孩子们制作的这些标本，不下于他们大学试验室里的那些动物标本！
    在展览会上我们可以看到浙江于潜县夏江乡小学米丘林小组种植的向日葵结出的葵花子的颗粒大得惊人。上海市上海中学初中学生自己培植的南大二四一九号小麦，麦粒大，产量多，每亩平均产量达四点零六担。孩子们组织了许多米丘林小组，开展植物科学的研究工作。河南原阳县许营完全小学四年级女生任国英在听了“米丘林的好学生”一课书以后，她把甜瓜的花粉交配到笋瓜的花柱上，最后结出来一个三斤重的大瓜，瓜是甜瓜味道，笋瓜的形状。
    看完了孩子们的这些科学技术展品后，再去看孩子们制作的丰富多采的工艺品，你就会更加感到孩子们的多才多艺。那里陈列有各种式样精美的刺绣、编织、剪贴、竹工、木工、泥工、雕塑、乐器和玩具。这些作品充分地表现了孩子们的艺术天才，也反映了他们美好幸福的生活和理想。
    在工艺展品中特别值得注意的是我国各少数民族地区孩子们的作品。许多精致的刺绣、雕塑和乐器都出于他们的一双灵巧的小手。如彝族孩子绣制的花腰带、荷包和花鞋，贵州少数民族孩子的蜡绣，维吾尔族孩子作的绣花帽子，以及蒙族孩子制作的乐器马头琴，苗族孩子制作的乐器籚笙等。展览台上有一件吸引人们的雕塑“在暴风雨中赶着羊群的哈萨克儿童”，是新疆军区小学四年级的一个锡伯族孩子德保塑造的。他塑造了在大风雪里骑着骏马奔驰着的一个哈萨克孩子的生动形象。
    在一幅巨大的用碎鸡蛋壳剪贴的“和平堡垒——莫斯科北京”的美丽如画的作品上，我们看到孩子们独出心裁的艺术创作；作品中还表现了孩子们对中苏伟大友谊的丰富感情和保卫世界和平的决心。这幅剪贴的右面是庄严辉煌的天安门，左面是高大雄伟的克里姆林宫，中间有一条平坦的大道相连。剪贴的上方有一群美丽的白鸽在蔚蓝色的天空上自由地飞翔。这幅作品是沈阳铁路第一完全小学学生的创作。
    孩子们的木工、纸工、泥工、编织和缝纫，也都做得十分精美和可爱。他们制作了成套的娃娃家的家具，还缝纫了许多漂亮的布娃娃。孩子们用马尾草、柳条、藤枝和棉线编织的各种草帽、篮子、筐子、花边都非常精美，各有风格。展览台上还特别陈列了一个七岁孩子矫大羽刻的几幅生动的小动物的石印，形象很简单可爱。
    当你看完了孩子们这些出色的创作，无论是科学技术作品还是工艺品，都会使你不由地赞叹孩子们的智慧是多么丰富。孩子们的创造不仅表现了他们的才能，也表现了国家对他们的爱护和教育，表现了他们的幸福生活。孩子们的才能和智慧，在幸福的新中国获得了从未有过的发展，他们的远大理想将在祖国社会主义建设的伟大事业中像美丽的花朵一样开放。（附图片）
