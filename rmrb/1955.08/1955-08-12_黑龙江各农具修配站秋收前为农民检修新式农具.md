    Heilongjiang's 66 agricultural implement repair stations are inspecting and repairing new-style farm tools for farmers before the autumn harvest.

    These agricultural implement repair stations were jointly established in May this year by the Provincial Department of Industry, Department of Agriculture, Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Handicraft Administration Bureau, and Preparatory Committee of the Handicraft Production Cooperative.

    In recent years, more than 80,000 new-style animal-powered farm tools have been promoted in rural Heilongjiang Province. These farm tools require the establishment of specialized repair stations to be responsible for periodic inspection and repair. In the past, due to the lack of such repair stations, some farmers had to travel by train to the city, two hundred *li* away, to repair or replace a single part. After the establishment of the agricultural implement repair stations, farmers in various places only need to send damaged farm tools or those with missing parts to nearby repair stations to have them repaired in a timely manner.

    To ensure the quality of inspection and repair, the Provincial Department of Industry also established a technical training class. In July, this training class selected technical workers from various repair stations to learn the repair techniques of harvesters. In the future, technical workers at the repair stations will also be trained according to the different farm tools used in each season.

    黑龙江各农具修配站秋收前为农民检修新式农具
    黑龙江省各地的六十六个农具修配站的修配工人，正在秋收前为农民检查和修理新式农具。
    这些农具修配站是今年五月间由省工业厅、农业厅、供销合作社、手工业管理局、手工业生产联社筹备委员会五个单位联合决定成立的。
    这几年来，黑龙江省农村推广了八万多件新式畜力农具。这些农具需要建立专门的修配站负责加以定期检查和修理。过去因为没有这样的修配站，有的农民为了要修配一个零件，就得从二百里外，坐火车到城里去修配。农具修配站建立以后，各地农民只须把破损的或丢失部件的农具送到附近的修配站，就能及时修理好。
    为了保证检修质量，省工业厅还成立了一个技术训练班。这个训练班在七月份曾抽调了各修配站的技术工人，来学习收割机的检修技术。今后也将按各个季节中使用不同农具的情况，分别训练各修理站的技术工人。　（新华社）
