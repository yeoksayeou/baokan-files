Comrade Premier, comrades and friends:

　　As we are about to depart from Pyongyang, the democratic capital of Korea, please allow me, on behalf of the delegation of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, to express our heartfelt gratitude to the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Korean people for their warm hospitality and profound care extended to the delegation of the People's Republic of China.

　　We feel greatly honored to have this opportunity to represent the Chinese people in attending the grand festival of the Korean people celebrating the tenth anniversary of the "August 15th" Liberation. We have also visited factories and villages in Korea, and everywhere we have seen the Korean people carrying out post-war recovery and construction work with strong perseverance and high enthusiasm. This spirit of the Korean people in daring to overcome difficulties is of great encouragement to the Chinese people who are engaged in socialist construction. The brilliant achievements made by the Korean people strongly demonstrate that under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the government of the Democratic People' Republic of Korea, the Korean people will surely achieve a comprehensive victory in the peaceful construction and the struggle for the peaceful reunification of Korea.

　　During our visit, the brotherly care and sincere friendship given to us by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the broad masses of the Korean people have deeply moved us. This friendship and care reflects the close, inseparable unity and friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, sharing weal and woe. We must convey this friendship and care of the Korean people to all the people of China, so as to further strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people that has been tested in battle. We firmly believe that the enhancement of friendship and unity between China and Korea will further strengthen the peace, democracy and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and will greatly contribute to the cause of defending lasting peace in the Far East and the world.

　　As we bid farewell, please allow me, on behalf of the delegation of the People's Republic of China, to once again pay our highest and fraternal respects to the heroic Korean people.

　　Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!

　　Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!

　　Long live the heroic Korean people and the Korean Workers' Party!

　　朱德副主席在离开平壤时发表的谈话首相同志、同志们和朋友们：
    在我们即将离别朝鲜的民主首都平壤之际，请允许我代表中华人民共和国代表团和中国人民，向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和朝鲜人民致衷心的谢意，感谢你们给予中华人民共和国代表团的热诚款待和深厚关怀。
    我们这一次能有机会代表中国人民前来参加朝鲜人民庆祝“八·一五”解放十周年的盛大节日，感到莫大的荣幸。我们又访问了朝鲜的工厂和农村，到处看到朝鲜人民正以坚强的毅力和高度的热忱在进行着战后的恢复和建设工作。朝鲜人民这种勇于克服困难的精神，对于正在从事社会主义建设的中国人民具有极大的鼓舞意义。朝鲜人民所取得的辉煌成就强有力地说明了：在朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的领导下，朝鲜人民必将取得和平建设和争取朝鲜和平统一斗争的全面胜利。
    在我们访问期间，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和朝鲜的广大人民，给予我们的兄弟般的关怀和真挚友爱使我们深受感动。这种友爱和关怀反映着中朝两国人民之间的休戚与共、亲密无间的团结友谊关系。我们一定要把朝鲜人民的这种友爱和关怀传达给全中国的人民，从而使中朝两国人民之间久经战斗考验的友谊进一步加强。我们深信，中朝两国友谊团结的增进将进一步壮大以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营，并且极有助于保卫远东和世界持久和平的事业。
    在我们临别之际，请允许我以中华人民共和国代表团的名义再一次向英雄的朝鲜人民致崇高的、兄弟的敬礼。
    中朝两国人民永恒的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！
    英雄的朝鲜人民和朝鲜劳动党万岁！
