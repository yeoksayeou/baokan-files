The "Cartoon Exhibition on Purging the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique," organized by the Chinese Artists Association and jointly hosted by the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Artists Association, the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace, Beihai Park, and the Summer Palace, opened simultaneously on August 7th at three locations: the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace, Daoningzhai in Beihai Park, and the Grand Theater in the Summer Palace.

The content of the exhibits at the three locations is identical, divided into four parts: 1. "Hu Feng's Counter-Revolutionary Activities Over Twenty Years," 2. "The Political Background of the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique," 3. "The Conspiracy Activities of the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique," and 4. "Learn from the Lessons, Raise Vigilance, and Resolutely Purge All Counter-Revolutionary Elements." The entire set of cartoons consists of approximately one hundred works, most of which are enlarged and colored versions of works published by cartoonists across the country in various newspapers and periodicals. The exhibition also displays the "People's Daily" editorials and editor's notes on the Hu Feng incident. This exhibition was held simultaneously in ten locations in Shanghai in mid-July and later toured major cities in East China, playing a significant role in publicity and education.

These exhibits, after being slightly reorganized by the Chinese Artists Association, are now on display in Beijing. Since the opening, the exhibition has been crowded with visitors every day. The exhibition is scheduled to run until August 28th. (E)

    北京市举办肃清胡风反革命集团漫画展览
    通过中国美术家协会组织的、由中国美术家协会上海分会和北京劳动人民文化宫、北海公园、颐和园联合举办的“肃清胡风反革命集团漫画展览会”，于八月七日分别在北京劳动人民文化宫、北海公园的道宁斋和颐和园的大戏台三处同时展出。
    三处展出作品的内容完全相同，每套分为四个部分：一、“胡风反革命二十年”，二、“胡风反革命集团的政治背景”，三、“胡风反革命集团的阴谋活动”，四、“吸取教训，提高警惕，坚决肃清一切反革命分子”。全套漫画约一百幅，大多数是全国漫画作者在各地报刊上发表过的作品而加以放大和添了彩色的。展览会并把“人民日报”关于胡风事件的社论、编者按语一起展出。这个展览会七月中曾在上海市区十个地方同时举行，后来又在华东各主要城市展出，起了很大的宣传教育作用。
    这些展品，现经中国美术家协会稍经整理后，在北京展出，开幕几天来，每天观众都很拥挤。展览会预定展出至八月二十八日结束。（谔）
