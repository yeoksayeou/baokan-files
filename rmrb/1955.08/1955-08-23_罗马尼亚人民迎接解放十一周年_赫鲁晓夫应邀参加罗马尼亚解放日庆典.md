In recent days, cities and villages throughout the country have been festively decorated. The capital, Bucharest, has donned its holiday best. National flags flutter along boulevards, squares, and streets, and bright red banners with large characters reading "Long Live August 23rd!" adorn buildings.

Enterprises and institutions have held gatherings to celebrate Romania's Liberation Day. Factories, mines, and oilfields have organized special work shifts to celebrate National Day. To greet the holiday, hundreds of thousands of workers, engineers, and technicians across the country have participated in a competition to strive for surplus accumulation. As of the 21st, the initiators of the movement—26 industrial enterprises in the Stalin region—had already accumulated 3.5 million lei (Romanian currency) in surplus funds for the state. In the competition to greet the 11th anniversary of liberation, many industrial departments and enterprises have also completed the tasks stipulated in the Five-Year Plan (1951-1955) ahead of schedule.

The laboring farmers in various places are greeting the holiday with a bumper harvest. At present, they are constantly overcoming the difficulties caused by unfavorable climatic conditions and are victoriously striving to complete the threshing work quickly.
