The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League issued instructions on the 20th regarding launching a movement among rural youth to reduce losses of grain and cotton during the autumn harvest.

The instructions stated that the Youth League organizations at all levels should extensively mobilize rural youth and children to carry out a movement to reduce losses of grain and cotton during the autumn harvest. This would not only directly increase the nation's harvest of grain and cotton and increase farmers' income, but also serve as a most vivid and practical ideological education in love of labor and collectivism for the vast number of youth and children, cultivating in youth the fine qualities of diligence, thrift, increased production, and economy in construction.

The instructions said: In order to carry out this movement, on the basis of extensive publicity and mobilization, League organizations should also focus on the following specific tasks:

1. Organize youth to study and improve harvesting techniques, conscientiously achieving careful harvesting, careful threshing, good drying, and good storage. League organizations should enable youth to effectively master harvesting techniques by inviting experienced farmers in harvesting, transporting, and threshing to give explanations and instruction, holding discussion meetings, organizing field visits, and publicizing advanced experiences. In addition, attention should also be paid to organizing youth to assist agricultural producers' cooperatives, mutual aid teams, etc., in doing a good job of repairing and preparing farm tools, vehicles, and warehouses before the harvest; and organizing youth to do voluntary labor to repair bridges and roads to avoid rollovers, bumps, and other grain losses or other accidents during transportation.

2. Mobilize all rural youth and children to carry out a grain-picking movement. Schools in rural and urban areas should also organize students to actively participate in grain-picking during their spare time. When picking grain, attention should be paid to picking it on the land of one's own cooperative, team, or household, or on other harvested land, to avoid disputes caused by picking grain.

3. The timeliness of autumn harvest work is very strong, and many farm tasks must be carried out intensively. Youth League organizations should actively assist state-owned farms and agricultural producers' cooperatives, organize various types of youth autumn harvest shock brigades according to production needs, take the lead in carrying out labor competitions, and strive for the victory of the autumn harvest. All types of shock brigades must pay attention to improving speed on the basis of ensuring quality, so as to be both good and fast. During the autumn harvest, the Youth League can also organize youth inspection teams to conduct inspections anytime and anywhere, promptly expose shortcomings, and fight against rough phenomena and various irresponsible behaviors in harvesting and threshing.

4. Mobilize rural youth and children to carry out autumn protection work. The youth in the militia should be more vigilant, spare no effort, watch over the autumn harvest and protect the grain, actively prevent theft, prevent special agents, prevent fire, and strictly prevent counter-revolutionary elements and unlawful landlords, reactionary rich peasants, and other bad elements from disrupting and sabotaging the autumn harvest. In order to avoid damage to grain by birds and animals, the Youth League can also organize youth mountain pest elimination groups and children's bird-scaring and grain-watching groups to protect the autumn harvest.

5. In order to ensure the successful development of this work, the provincial and county Youth League committees can formulate some reward measures, launch challenge competitions among youth, and promptly commend and reward model units and outstanding youth, in order to encourage the labor enthusiasm of the youth.

　　青年团中央发布指示
　　要求农村青少年开展减少粮棉损耗的运动
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会二十日发布关于发动农村青少年在秋收中开展减少粮食、棉花损耗运动的指示。
    指示说，各地青年团组织广泛地发动农村青年和少年在秋收中开展一个减少粮食、棉花损耗的运动，这不仅可以直接为国家增加粮食、棉花的收获，可以增加农民收入，同时也是对广大青年和少年的一次最生动最实际的热爱劳动和集体主义的思想教育，培养青年克勤克俭、增产节约、勤劳建设的优良作风。
    指示说：为了开展这个运动，在广泛宣传动员的思想基础上，团的组织还应抓住以下几项具体工作：
    一、组织青年学习和提高收获技术，认真做到细收、细打、晒好、藏好。团的组织要通过邀请对收割、运、打有经验的农民进行讲解传授，召开座谈会，组织实地参观，宣传先进经验等方式，使青年能切实掌握收割技术。此外，还要注意组织青年协助农业生产合作社、互助组等作好收割前的农具、车辆、仓库的修理、准备工作；组织青年义务劳动，修桥补路，以避免运送粮食中发生翻车、颠簸等粮食损耗或其他事故。
    二、发动全体农村青年和少年开展拣粮运动。农村及城镇中的学校也应组织学生利用课余时间积极参加拣粮。拣粮时要注意在本社、本组、本户的土地或其他收割后的土地上拣拾，避免因拣粮而发生争抢纠纷。
    三、秋收工作的时间性很强，许多农活都须紧张进行。青年团组织要积极协助国营农场和农业生产合作社，根据生产需要组织各种类型的青年秋收突击队，带头开展劳动竞赛，争取秋收的胜利。各种突击队必须注意在保证质量的基础上提高速度，做到又好又快。在秋收中青年团还可以组织青年检查队，随时随地进行检查，及时揭发缺点，向收割打场中的粗糙现象和各种不负责任的行为作斗争。
    四、发动农村青年和少年开展护秋工作。民兵中的青年更应提高警惕，不辞劳苦，看秋护粮，积极防盗、防特、防火，严防反革命分子和不法地主、反动富农分子及其他坏分子在秋收中的捣乱破坏。为免除鸟兽损害粮食，青年团还可组织青年除山害小组、少年儿童赶鸟看粮小组来保护秋收。
    五、为使这一工作胜利开展，各省、县团委可制定一些奖励办法，在青年中发起挑战竞赛，及时表扬奖励模范单位和优秀青年，以鼓舞青年的劳动热情。（新华社）
