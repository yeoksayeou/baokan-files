Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan: The Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission has several planning and design personnel who are currently conducting planning work for the Han River basin, based on the requirements of flood control, irrigation, navigation, water and soil conservation, and hydropower development and utilization. Prior to the commencement of the planning work, the planning and design personnel carefully sorted out and studied a large amount of various data related to the Han River basin and earnestly studied the experience of the Yellow River basin planning. The planning work began in March of this year. After more than three months of intensive work, they have concluded the analysis of the hydrological characteristics of the Han River and the calculation of floods and are now starting to formulate technical measures to fundamentally control the Han River and determine the first batch of comprehensive utilization and other flood control, irrigation, and other engineering measures. The entire planning work will be completed in the first half of 1956.
    The Han River is the largest tributary of the Yangtze River. It flows south from Shaanxi Province, traversing the northern and central parts of Hubei Province, and converges into the Yangtze River in Wuhan City. It is 1,500 kilometers long, with a basin area of more than 170,000 square kilometers. The Han River basin is wide, with many tributaries and a large flow. The downstream river channel is curved and narrow, the water flow is not smooth, and it has long threatened the lives and property of millions of people in the Jianghan Plain. In the spring of 1950, the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission dispatched hundreds of survey personnel to conduct surveys in the Han River basin, collecting hydrological, topographical, meteorological, geological, and socio-economic data. Currently, the survey personnel are continuing to further survey and collect topographical and geological data for several larger reservoirs and irrigation areas in the planning and design of the upper and middle reaches of the Han River.
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 4th: Preparations are being stepped up for the formulation of a basin plan for the management of the Han River. The survey work carried out by hundreds of survey workers in the river valleys and deep mountains of the upper and middle reaches of the Han River has achieved some results. Some survey workers have surveyed and drilled at the sites of several larger reservoirs in the upper and middle reaches of the Han River and have now collected a large amount of data on topography and geology and drawn topographic and geological maps. The survey personnel in the Tang and Bai River areas along the Han River tributaries will be able to submit data on water sources, soil, agriculture, and flood control related to the future development of the Tang and Bai River irrigation areas by the end of August. The geological survey team dispatched by the Ministry of Geology has also completed the geological survey of about 5,000 square kilometers on both sides of the Han River from Zhongxiang to Xiangyang.
    In order to provide data for the management of the Han River as early as possible, the survey workers brave the scorching sun or torrential rain in the south every day, carrying survey equipment, carefully conducting surveys, drilling, and measurements. In the evening, they continue to study and sort out various data.

    长江水利委员会进行汉水流域规划工作
    新华社武汉电　长江水利委员会几十个规划设计人员，正根据防洪、灌溉、航运、水土保持和水力开发利用的要求，进行汉水流域的规划工作。规划工作开始以前，规划设计人员曾经仔细地整理和研究了大批有关汉水流域的各种资料，认真地学习了黄河流域规划的经验。规划工作在今年三月开始，经过三个多月的紧张工作后，他们已经结束对汉水水文特性的分析和洪水的计算，并正着手拟定根治汉水的技术措施，确定第一批综合利用和其他防洪、灌溉等工程的措施。全部规划工作，将在一九五六年上半年完成。
    汉水是长江最大的一条支流。由陕西省南流，横贯湖北省北部和中部，经武汉市汇流入江。全长一千五百公里，流域面积为十七万多平方公里。汉水流域广、支流多、流量大，下游河道弯曲而狭窄，水流不畅，长期威胁着江汉平原千百万人民的生命财产。一九五零年春天，长江水利委员会派出几百个勘测人员，开始在汉水流域进行勘测，搜集水文、地形、气象、地质等资料和社会经济情况。目前，勘察人员继续在汉水上、中游进一步测绘和搜集规划设计中几个较大的水库、灌溉区的地形和地质等资料。
    新华社武汉四日电　为治理汉水制定流域规划的准备工作正在加紧进行。几百个勘测工作人员在汉水上、中游的河谷、深山之间所作的勘测工作已取得部分成绩。一部分勘测工作者在汉水上、中游勘测、钻探几个较大的水库地址，现在已经搜集了大批的有关地形、地质的资料，绘出了地形、地质图。在汉水支流唐、白河沿岸地区的查勘人员，八月底就可提出将来举办唐、白河灌溉区的有关水源、土壤、农业和防御洪水等方面的资料。地质部派出的地质普查队，也已经完成了锺祥到襄阳一段汉水两岸约五千平方公里的地质普查工作。
    为了及早地提供治理汉水的资料，勘测工作人员们每天冒着南方的烈日或倾盆大雨，携带着勘测器具，仔细地进行查勘、钻探和测量，晚上，他们就继续研究和整理各种资料。
