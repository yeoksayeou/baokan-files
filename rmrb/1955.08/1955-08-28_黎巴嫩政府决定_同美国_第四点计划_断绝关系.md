Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, August 27th: Beirut news: Lebanese Minister of Social Affairs, Rashid Karami, announced on the 26th that the Lebanese government has decided to sever all relations with the United States' "Point Four Program."

Karami said that the Lebanese government made this decision because the American authorities executing the "Point Four Program" greatly reduced American "aid" after some differences arose between them and the Lebanese government.

Prior to this, the Lebanese newspaper "Al-Hayat" reported that the Lebanese Ministry of Social Affairs had formulated some plans, and the conditions put forward by the United States International Cooperation Administration mission for providing the necessary assistance to these plans were: The Lebanese Ministry of Social Affairs should grant the American mission the power to supervise the implementation of all these plans. The Ministry of Social Affairs rejected this request, believing that it would place a Lebanese ministry under the control of a foreign mission.

　　黎巴嫩政府决定
　　同美国“第四点计划”断绝关系
    新华社二十七日讯　贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩社会事务部长拉希德·卡拉米二十六日宣布，黎巴嫩政府已经决定同美国的“第四点计划”断绝一切关系。
    卡拉米说，黎巴嫩政府之所以采取这个决定，是因为执行“第四点计划”的美国当局在同黎巴嫩政府之间发生一些分歧以后就大大地削减了美国的
  “援助”。
    在这以前，黎巴嫩“生活报”曾报道，黎巴嫩社会事务部拟定了一些计划，而美国国际合作署的使团所提出的给予这些计划必要的援助的条件是：黎巴嫩社会事务部要给美国使团以监督执行所有这些计划的权力。社会事务部拒绝这个要求，认为这将使黎巴嫩的一个部受一个外国使团的控制。
