    The Brilliant Example of Preventing Traitors and Counter-revolutionaries
    ——Reflections on Re-watching Films such as "The Great Citizen," "Party Certificate," and "The Highest Reward"
  　Liang Ruhui
    Today, as the nationwide struggle to resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements is being carried out, it is very meaningful that the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture is systematically re-releasing a batch of films related to preventing traitors and counter-revolutionaries – "The Great Citizen," "Party Certificate," "The Highest Reward," "The Reclusive Old Man," etc. These films are records of the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution and the victories achieved, and we can learn a lot from them.
    The historical background of "The Great Citizen" is the period when the Soviet Union implemented the New Economic Policy and developed the first Five-Year Plan, a time of decisive battle between socialism and capitalism. This acute class struggle was also reflected within the Communist Party. In the film, we see that the Bolsheviks, represented by Shakhov, closely united around the Party Central Committee and waged an irreconcilable struggle to implement the Party's correct line; while the Trotskyists, represented by Kartashov and Borovsky, desperately clamored that the revolution had failed and that socialism could not be built in one country, attempting to organize a delegation against the Party Central Committee to participate in the Party Congress. These counter-revolutionary elements also concentrated their efforts on sabotaging the "Red Metallurgical United Workers" factory, which controlled one-third of the country's tractors and one-fifth of its tanks, using various means of terror to prevent the working class from advancing on the road of economic construction.
    Here, we see a vivid fact: when our revolutionary cause is advancing victoriously, the enemy is not sleeping. The overthrown classes will never be reconciled to withdrawing from the stage of history. They will definitely struggle, and the means they adopt will become increasingly despicable and vicious. At the same time, with the victory of the people's revolution, the sabotage activities of imperialism are bound to intensify. Imperialists, on the one hand, buy off and instruct scum and traitors among the people to carry out sabotage; on the other hand, they constantly use various opportunities to send in large numbers of spies and special agents. They are constantly "gauging the direction" and shooting poisonous arrows. This is very clearly demonstrated in the film "The Highest Reward."
    In these films, we see the two-faced tactics used by the enemy in carrying out counter-revolutionary activities in the new situation after the revolution's victory. In "The Great Citizen," after the Trotskyists seized leadership positions in the provincial committee, on the one hand, they openly engaged in "theoretical" debates, saying that they were "worried about the Party" and "worried about the country," but secretly they engaged in despicable divisive tactics, conspiracy and framing, and slander against Shakhov and others who adhered to principles as "opposing the Party" and "fabricating rumors and engaging in sectarianism." They were full of Marxist rhetoric, but in reality, they were only "using their slogans to achieve our goals" (Kartashov's words); and when their anti-Party and counter-revolutionary criminal attempts were defeated, they viciously carried out assassination activities. In "Party Certificate," the hidden enemy, Chubin, pretended to be active, "loved to read political books the most," and gained the trust of the young Communist Party member Yasha, who introduced him to the Party; he used the "self-inflicted injury" of deliberately burning himself in a fire he set to gain people's respect and deceive Anna about her suspicions of him; he stole Anna's Party certificate and helped another female special agent sneak into the People's Committee, and even pretended at the Party meeting to say: "Thinking of Kirov's assassination, I can't help but shudder… Comrades, be vigilant!" The special agent Lefo in "The Reclusive Old Man" superficially comforted his father's loneliness in life in every possible way, but secretly used his father's home as a cover for his counter-revolutionary activities, and when his father discovered his secret activities, this inhuman murderer revealed his true狰狞 face and even wanted to kill his own father to eliminate the evidence.
    Our enemies understand that fortresses are easily breached from within. They always try every possible means to break into the Communist Party, as Stalin pointed out: "... the enemies of the people will resort to double-dealing, and in double-dealing they will disguise themselves as Bolsheviks, disguise themselves as Party members, in order to gain trust and break into our organization." In "The Great Citizen," we hear the Trotskyists clamoring: "We must use all methods to work our way into the heart of the enemy," and they really did break into the heart: Kartashov, Borovsky, and Demidrov all seized high positions in the Party organization and used their powers to carry out conspiracies against the Party Central Committee. After their conspiracies were smashed, they hid themselves: "We should immediately change our methods of activity and go underground, let them think we are gone, but in fact we still exist. In this world, secret power may be stronger than anything else. No one will suspect secret activities." They also directed their undiscovered pawns to continue counter-revolutionary activities in the factory.
    Enemies hidden within the Party are more dangerous than open enemies. As Comrade Maxin, the representative of the Central Supervisory Committee, said to the workers in "The Great Citizen": "... all this is very complicated—because the people engaged in conspiracy are not rich peasants, not open enemies, nor White Guards, but people who call themselves comrades and Party members,... they swear an oath to the Party, swear an oath to Lenin, swear an oath to the Central Committee, expressing their loyalty; while attempting to send their own delegation to sneak into the congress,... to fight against Lenin's Central Committee, to fight against Comrade Stalin. The true face of this kind of enemy cannot be recognized at once, they are very deceptive." The film reminds us here that we must maintain revolutionary vigilance at all times. Without a firm class stand, a clear head, sensitivity to all abnormal phenomena, and a tireless fighting spirit, we cannot see through the enemy's various disguises.
    The fact that Chubin in "Party Certificate" infiltrated the Party so easily is worth learning from. The Party branch was not clear about the origins of this murderer from Siberia, and only saw his superficial and one-sided phenomena; it neither strictly examined the history of this person of unknown origin, nor carefully studied whether his performance was essential or a disguise; at the same time, after the fire set by the enemy occurred, it did not seriously investigate the cause of the fire and quickly absorbed the arsonist into the Party. After joining the Party, the Party organization did not conduct regular and systematic supervision of this "new Party member," so that this counter-revolutionary element was able to lurk in the Party for a long time without being discovered!
    From these films, we can learn the skills to fight against hidden enemies. Shakhov's high degree of principle and spirit of adhering to the struggle as a true Bolshevik, especially his revolutionary vigilance based on his unlimited loyalty to the Party and the revolutionary cause, is always worth learning. He tirelessly fought against the enemy's various conspiracies, and he incisively exposed the two-faced features of Kartashov and his ilk: "As long as you are against the Party and the Soviet regime, you will form a gang with them. Today you agree with the views of the Trotskyists, and tomorrow you agree with the views of the Socialist Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks." After he removed the Trotskyist Avdief, who was lurking in the factory, from his post, he immediately judged from this abnormal reaction that the chief engineer must have political problems because he did not raise any protests; he closely observed and examined every move of the second secretary Demidrov, and finally forced this hidden enemy to expose his true colors.
    In summarizing the struggle against the remnants of hostile classes during the period of the first Five-Year Plan, Stalin once pointed out: "Revolutionary vigilance is a quality that Bolsheviks need especially now." This is what every Communist should always remember.
    What is the enemy of revolutionary vigilance? That is paralysis, carelessness, liberalism, unprincipled "humanitarianism," not asking about political tendencies, and being careless…. These films reveal this lesson from different angles. We see that the complacency of old Dubok in "The Great Citizen," the non-political involvement of Professor Milas in "The Reclusive Old Man," the naiveté of Yasha and Anna in "Party Certificate," and the lack of strictness of some grassroots Party organizations all unconsciously provided favorable conditions for the enemy's sabotage. Look at the encounter of Professor Milas, he shut himself at home and did not actively participate in the country's political struggle, he thought that he could bury himself in his scientific work. As a result, his own son became a traitor to the motherland, and he himself was almost killed. Isn't this a bloody lesson?
    For every patriotic citizen, vigilance is a necessary quality. From these films, we can find that this valuable quality is growing in many ordinary Soviet citizens. The young engineer Nadya ("The Great Citizen") smelled the bad egg from the words and deeds of the chief engineer; Professor Milas ("The Reclusive Old Man") found that his son was a traitor to the motherland and a murderous executioner, and resolutely abandoned his father-son affection and reported to the public security authorities; Naga ("The Highest Reward") suspected her lover Anatoly's sneaky actions and immediately went to the security agency to report them…. There are too many such examples to cite. Soviet people are the builders of the country, and also the defenders of the construction cause. They consciously form a solid copper wall that no one can destroy. Dzerzhinsky once said to a special agent who was arrested and tried and believed that he was accidentally caught only because his daughter lost important documents:
    "You are wrong. If the masses do not support us, if every worker and every Red Army soldier does not realize that exposing conspiracies is not only the business of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission, but also the business of all the workers in the Soviet Union, then your daughter's loss of a volume of documents would not have exposed the conspiracy. Your daughter's loss of a volume of documents was accidental, but the Red Army soldier's finding it and arresting her was not accidental. The vigilance of an ordinary Red Army soldier is not accidental. The power of the Extraordinary Commission lies here."
    Let us learn from these films the example of the Soviet Bolsheviks and patriotic Soviet citizens in raising vigilance and fighting against all enemies at any time and any place. As long as we increase our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, recognize the characteristics of the current class struggle, sweep away our own right-leaning paralysis, and learn to distinguish the faces and tricks of hidden counter-revolutionary elements, we will surely defeat the enemy.

    防奸反特的光辉榜样
    ——重看“伟大的公民”、“党证”、“最高的奖赏”等影片的感想
  　梁汝怀
    在全国范围内开展坚决、彻底、干净、全部地肃清一切反革命分子的斗争的今天，文化部电影事业管理局有计划地在全国各地重新放映一批有关防奸反特的影片——“伟大的公民”、“党证”、“最高的奖赏”、“世外老人”等，这是很有意义的。这些影片都是革命同反革命进行斗争并取得胜利的纪录，我们从这里可以学到很多东西。
    “伟大的公民”的时代背景是苏联实行新经济政策和发展国民经济第一个五年计划的时期，是社会主义同资本主义进行决斗的年代。这种尖锐的阶级斗争在共产党的内部也得到反映。我们在影片里看到：以沙霍夫为代表的布尔什维克党人紧密地团结在党中央的周围，为执行党的正确的路线进行不调和的斗争；而以卡尔塔萧夫、鲍罗夫斯基等为代表的托洛茨基分子，则拼命地叫嚣革命已经失败，叫嚣一国不能建设社会主义，企图组织一个反对党中央的代表团去参加党的代表大会。这些反革命分子，还集中力量来破坏掌握全国三分之一拖拉机和五分之一坦克的“红色冶金联合工作者”工厂，用各种恐怖手段阻挠工人阶级在经济建设的大道上前进。
    在这里，我们看到一个活生生的事实：当我们的革命事业胜利前进的时候，敌人并没有睡觉，被打倒的阶级从来就不会甘心退出历史舞台的。他们一定要挣扎，他们所采取的手段也越来越卑鄙，越来越狠毒。同时，随着人民革命的胜利，帝国主义的破坏活动必然加剧。帝国主义者一面收买、指使人民中的败类和叛徒进行破坏；一面不断地利用各种各样机会，派遣进去大批间谍和特务。他们无时无刻不在“窥测方向”，射出一支支毒箭。这在影片“最高的奖赏”里表现得非常清楚。
    在这些影片里，我们看到了敌人在革命胜利后的新情况下进行反革命活动的两面派手法。在“伟大的公民”里，托派分子窃据了省委会的领导岗位以后，一方面公开地进行“理论”争辩，说自己是“为党”“为国家担忧”，暗地里却进行卑鄙的分裂、拉拢手段，阴谋陷害，诬蔑坚持原则的沙霍夫等是“反对党”“捏造谣言闹宗派”。他们满口马克思主义，实际上只是“在他们的口号下面来达到我们的目的”（卡尔塔萧夫说的话）；而当他们的反党反革命的罪恶企图归于失败的时候，他们就恶毒地进行暗杀活动了。在“党证”里，暗藏的敌人酋宾假装积极，“最爱看政治方面的书籍”，骗得了年青的共产党员雅沙的信任，被介绍入党；他用故意在自己放的火中来灼伤自己的“苦肉计”，骗得了人们的尊敬，蒙混过安娜对他的怀疑；他偷窃了安娜的党证，帮另一个女特务混进人民委员会，在党的会议上居然还装模作样地说：“想起了基洛夫的被刺，我就不寒而栗。……同志们，警惕性啊！”“世外老人”里的特务分子莱福，表面上无微不至地安慰着父亲在生活中的寂寞，暗地里却是把父亲的家作为自己进行反革命活动的掩护所，而当父亲发现他的秘密勾当时，这个没有人性的凶手就露出他的狰狞的真面目，竟然想杀死自己的父亲，消灭罪迹。
    我们的敌人懂得堡垒是容易从内部攻破的。他们总是要千方百计打进共产党的内部来，正如斯大林所指出的：“……人民公敌将玩弄两面手法，而且在玩弄两面手法时将伪装成布尔什维克，伪装成党员，以便取得信任和打入我们的组织。”在“伟大的公民”里，我们就听到托派分子的叫嚣：“我们必须用一切方法打入敌人的心脏工作”，他们果然就打入到心脏里来了：卡尔塔萧夫、鲍罗夫斯基、捷米卓夫都窃踞党组织的高级岗位，利用职权，进行反对党中央的阴谋活动。而在他们的阴谋被粉碎之后，他们还把自己隐藏起来：“我们应当立刻改变活动方式转入地下，让他觉得我们已经没有了，其实我们依然存在，在这个世界里秘密的力量是可能比什么都强的，秘密活动谁也不会疑心。”他们还指挥着尚未被识破的爪牙在工厂里继续进行反革命活动。
    暗藏在党内的敌人比公开的敌人更危险。正如“伟大的公民”里党中央监察委员会代表马克辛向工人们所说的：“……这一切很复杂——因为从事阴谋的人，不是富农，不是公开的敌人，也不是白卫军，而是自称为同志和党员的人，……他们一面对党宣誓，对列宁宣誓，对中央委员会宣誓，表示忠诚；一面企图派自己的代表团混进大会，……跟列宁的中央委员会斗争，跟斯大林同志斗争。这种敌人的真面目，不是一下子就能认清的，他们有很大的欺骗性。”影片在这里提醒了我们，必须时时刻刻地保持着革命警惕。如果没有坚定的阶级立场，清醒的头脑，对一切不正常现象的敏感，和不懈的战斗精神，我们就不能识破敌人的各种伪装。
    “党证”里的酋宾那么轻易地混入党内，这是值得我们引为教训的。这个来自西伯利亚的杀人凶犯，党支部对他的来历是不清楚的，只是看到他的表面的、片面的现象；既没有严格地审查这个来历不明的人的历史，也没有认真地研究他的表现究竟是本质的东西还是假象；同时，在发生了敌人放火的事件以后，也没有认真去检查起火的原因，很快地就吸收纵火犯入党了。入党以后，党的组织也没有对这个“新党员”进行经常的系统的监督，使得这个反革命分子居然长期潜伏在党内未被发觉！
    我们从这些影片里，可以学习同暗藏的敌人斗争的本领。沙霍夫的那种真正的布尔什维克的高度原则性和坚持斗争的精神，特别是他的基于对党、对革命事业的无限忠诚的革命警惕性，是永远值得我们学习的。他不懈地对敌人的各种阴谋活动进行斗争，他一针见血地揭穿卡尔塔萧夫们的两面派嘴脸：“只要是反对党和苏维埃政权的人，你就跟他们结成一伙，今天跟托派的见解一致，明天又跟社会革命党和孟什维克的见解一致。”他撤掉了那个潜伏在工厂里的托派分子阿符杰捷夫的职务以后，看见他并不提出什么抗议，就立刻从这个不正常的反应中判断出这个总工程师一定有政治问题；他严密地观察和审查了第二书记捷米卓夫的一举一动，终于迫使这个暗藏的敌人暴露了自己的面目。
    斯大林在总结第一个五年计划时期和敌对阶级残余的斗争时曾经指出：“革命警觉性就是布尔什维克现在特别必需的品性。”这是我们每个共产党人所应该永远记住的。
    革命警惕性的敌人是什么呢？那就是麻痹、大意、自由主义、无原则的“人道主义”、不问政治倾向、粗枝大叶……。这些影片从不同的角度，揭示出这个教训。我们看到：“伟大的公民”中的老杜鲍克的骄傲自满，“世外老人”中的米拉斯教授的不问政治，“党证”中的雅沙和安娜的天真，某些基层党组织的不严格，都在不知不觉中替敌人的破坏提供了有利的条件。看看米拉斯教授的遭遇吧，他把自己关在家里，不积极参加国家的政治斗争，他以为这样就可以埋头搞自己的科学工作。结果呢，自己的儿子成了祖国的叛徒，自己也几乎被杀害。这不是血淋淋的教训吗？
    对于每一个爱国的公民来说，警惕性是必需具备的品质。我们从这些影片里，可以发现这种可贵的品质正在许多普通的苏维埃公民身上成长着。年青工程师娜嘉（“伟大的公民”），从总工程师的言行里，就嗅出了坏蛋的味道；米拉斯教授（“世外老人”）发现自己的儿子是祖国的叛徒和杀人的刽子手，就毅然决然地丢开父子感情，去向公安当局报告；娜加（“最高的奖赏”）怀疑了她的爱人阿纳道里的鬼鬼祟祟的行动，就立刻到保安机关去检举……这样的例子是举不胜举的。苏维埃人是国家的建设者，也是建设事业的保卫者。他们自觉地结成一道坚固的、任何人破坏不了的铜墙铁壁。捷尔任斯基曾对一个被捕受审时认为自己只是由于他的女儿失落了重要的文件才偶然落网的特务说：
    “你错了。如果群众不拥护我们，如果每个工人、每个红军不觉悟到揭发阴谋不仅是全苏肃反委员会的事情，而且也是全苏联一切劳动者的事情的话，那末你的女儿掉了一卷文件也就不会使阴谋暴露的。你的女儿失落一卷文件虽然是偶然的，可是红军战士却不是偶然拣到它的，不是偶然地逮捕她的。一个普通红军战士的警惕性并非偶然的。肃反委员会的力量就在这里。”
    让我们从这些影片中学习苏联布尔什维克党人和爱国的苏维埃公民提高警惕、随时随地同一切敌人作斗争的榜样吧。只要我们百倍地提高革命警惕性，认清当前阶级斗争的特点，扫清我们自己的右倾麻痹思想，学会辨别暗藏的反革命分子的嘴脸和伎俩，我们就一定能战胜敌人。
