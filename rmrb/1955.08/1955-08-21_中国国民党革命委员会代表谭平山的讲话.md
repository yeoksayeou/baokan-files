Comrades:

It has been thirty years since Mr. Liao Zhongkai was assassinated by domestic counter-revolutionaries and imperialists on August 20, 1925. Today, as we hold this memorial meeting, we express our boundless respect and remembrance for the revolutionary martyr Mr. Liao Zhongkai, who valiantly fought and sacrificed himself for the Chinese democratic revolution.

Mr. Liao Zhongkai was a loyal follower and capable assistant of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and an outstanding democratic revolutionary and patriot in the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism and feudalism. He participated in the revolutionary struggle led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen from 1903 onwards; his revolutionary activities were closely linked to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great contributions to the Chinese revolution and played a significant role in the Chinese democratic revolutionary movement.

In 1921, the Chinese working class established its own political party, the Chinese Communist Party, which put forward the revolutionary program of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism and the proposition of organizing a national democratic revolutionary united front, and first established contact with Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the great democratic revolutionary of modern China, when the working class stepped onto the stage of history and became the central force of the Chinese revolution, first acknowledged this force, accepted the assistance of the socialist Soviet Union and the Chinese working class, and decided to adopt the three great revolutionary polices of alliance with the Soviet Union, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to the workers' and peasants' movements, determined to reorganize the Chinese Kuomintang. This was a huge leap forward in Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary career. At that time, China's feudal forces and comprador bourgeoisie further turned to imperialism, cruelly enslaving the Chinese people, suppressing the people's movement, and attempting to extinguish the flames of the Chinese revolution. This struggle between revolution and counter-revolution was sharply reflected within the Chinese Kuomintang. At that time, the right-wing reactionary elements within the Chinese Kuomintang implemented the will of the landlord class, the comprador bourgeoisie, and imperialism, fiercely attacking the three major policies and opposing the reorganization of the Kuomintang. As a capable assistant to Mr. Sun Yat-sen, Mr. Liao Zhongkai resolutely promoted and pushed forward the three major revolutionary policies. In the fierce struggle to reorganize the Chinese Kuomintang, Mr. Liao Zhongkai did his utmost to assist Mr. Sun Yat-sen, defeated the obstruction and sabotage of the reactionary elements, and with the specific assistance and direct participation of the Chinese Communist Party, finally convened the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang in early 1924, reorganized the Chinese Kuomintang, issued the famous declaration of the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang, determined the program of action for the revolution at that time, and formed the first united front in the Chinese revolutionary movement.

Mr. Liao Zhongkai was the most resolute executor of the three major revolutionary policies. As a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and concurrently Minister of Labor and Minister of Agriculture, he went deep into the masses, actively supported the workers' and peasants' movements, and defended the interests of the workers and peasants. He once said: "The faction that represents the interests of the majority of the people is the revolutionary faction, and the faction that opposes the interests of more people is the counter-revolutionary faction. ...Bureaucratic warlords and imperialism are the common enemies of our entire people; the faction that represents the people to eliminate these two forces is the revolutionary faction. The working and peasant classes account for the largest proportion of our population; the faction that eliminates the forces that oppress the working and peasant classes is also the revolutionary faction. Conversely, those who compromise with warlords and imperialists and oppress workers and peasants are the counter-revolutionary faction." This clearly shows that Mr. Liao Zhongkai stood on the side of the working people and resolutely opposed imperialism and feudal forces.

At that time, the revolutionary forces based in Guangdong developed vigorously, setting off a nationwide upsurge against imperialism and feudalism. International imperialism and the domestic feudal and comprador bourgeoisie at that time knew that the victory of the Chinese people's revolution meant their failure, so they further colluded with each other, adopting various open and insidious means to undermine the Chinese people's revolutionary cause, oppose the Chinese people's revolutionary movement, and launched a series of incidents, such as the imperialist gunboats sailing to Bai'etan to intimidate and prevent Guangdong from intercepting customs surplus, and the Guangzhou Merchant Corps incident headed by comprador Chen Lianbo. These were all joint offensives by imperialism and the feudal comprador bourgeoisie against the revolutionary base at that time, attempting to strangle the Chinese people's revolution with internal and external cooperation. Mr. Liao Zhongkai and Mr. Sun Yat-sen, with the support of the revolutionary people, resolutely fought back against the joint offensive of domestic and foreign reactionaries and consolidated the revolutionary base in Guangdong at that time.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen passed away on March 12, 1925. The mourning of the great revolutionary by the people of the whole country formed a new revolutionary upsurge. Mr. Liao Zhongkai resolutely shouldered the responsibility of implementing the three major revolutionary policies, faithfully implementing Mr. Sun Yat-sen's will. In suppressing the conspiracy of Yang Ximin and Liu Zhenhuan's rebellion in collusion with imperialism, and in supporting the long-term struggle of the Guangzhou-Hong Kong General Strike of the Chinese working class against imperialism, Mr. Liao Zhongkai adopted resolute revolutionary policies, giving the counter-revolutionary forces a severe blow. As everyone knows, the three major revolutionary policies were the common program of action for the revolutionary people of the whole country at that time, and the political basis for cooperation between the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Kuomintang at that time. Domestic and foreign reactionary forces, in order to undermine the great revolutionary solidarity of the Chinese people at that time, naturally hated Mr. Liao Zhongkai, who was loyal to the three major policies. On this day thirty years ago, Mr. Liao Zhongkai was finally assassinated by domestic and foreign counter-revolutionary forces using the most despicable means. After Mr. Liao Zhongkai's death, Chiang Kai-shek, a counter-revolutionary double-dealer, conspired to usurp the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang, exposed his hideous features in the middle of the victory of the Northern Expedition, betrayed the three major policies, betrayed the revolution, and caused the failure of the First Domestic Revolutionary War.

Thirty years have passed since Mr. Liao Zhongkai's death. In the past thirty years, our country has undergone tremendous changes. Under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, after the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, the Chinese people finally achieved the great victory of the people's revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in 1949, ended the long history of oppression and enslavement, established the People's Republic of China, a people's democratic dictatorship, and completed the first stage of the Chinese revolution. Since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country have been doing extremely glorious and great undertakings that our predecessors have never done. Our country's international status has been raised to an unprecedented height, our national defense strength has been unprecedentedly strengthened, and our people's democratic power has been unprecedentedly consolidated. Now the people of the whole country are actively striving to realize the great first five-year plan and to build our country into a great socialist country. Our country has formed an unbreakable friendly alliance with the Soviet Union, has fraternal friendship with all people's democratic countries, and, together with peace-loving countries and people all over the world, is jointly fighting to defend world peace. The ideals that Mr. Liao Zhongkai sacrificed his blood for thirty years ago have not only all become reality, but have far surpassed them! This is enough to comfort the martyrs as we commemorate Mr. Liao Zhongkai today.

As we commemorate Mr. Liao Zhongkai here today, we must learn from the lessons of Mr. Liao Zhongkai's murder, increase our vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen the current struggle against internal and external enemies, and resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements. Here, I would like to point out to the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang: We must realize that the realization of the first five-year plan is an extremely sharp, fierce, and complex class struggle, and we must be vigilant against the enemy's sabotage at all times.

As we commemorate Mr. Liao Zhongkai here today, we feel boundless anger towards the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, who betrayed Mr. Sun Yat-sen and Mr. Liao Zhongkai and continues to occupy Taiwan with the support of US imperialism! We must strengthen our work in all aspects and carry out unremitting struggle for the liberation of Taiwan. Some of the people who followed the bandit Chiang Kai-shek to Taiwan deeply know Mr. Liao Zhongkai's revolutionary ideas and revolutionary qualities, and some of them were personally educated by Mr. Liao Zhongkai; today is the 30th anniversary of Mr. Liao Zhongkai's death, these people should deeply reflect on the mistake of following the bandit Chiang Kai-shek in betraying the revolution, recognize that the bandit Chiang Kai-shek has always been a traitor to Mr. Sun Yat-sen and Mr. Liao Zhongkai, and is a public enemy of the people of the whole country, and hope that they can wake up as soon as possible, break away from the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, strive to abandon the dark and turn to the light, perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes, and return to the embrace of the motherland.

Speech by He Xiangning, wife of Liao Zhongkai:

Chairman, distinguished guests, friends!

On this 30th anniversary of Zhongkai's death, comrades and friends, holding such a grand memorial meeting is a great honor for Zhongkai. Zhongkai is but one of the millions of martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the Chinese revolution over the past few decades. The glory that you friends are giving him today should belong to all the Chinese people who have struggled arduously for China's independence and freedom for nearly a hundred years, and to all the martyrs who have shed blood for the great Chinese revolution. As a family member of an ordinary soldier in the Chinese revolution, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of you friends and comrades.

Until the very last moment of his life, Zhongkai remained loyal to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's three major revolutionary policies of "alliance with the Soviet Union, learning from Russia," "supporting the workers' movement, supporting the peasants' movement," and "alliance with the Chinese Communist Party," resisted imperialist aggression, and gave his life for this revolutionary cause. Thirty years ago today, Zhongkai was assassinated by fascists. Although the enemy of the people took Zhongkai's life, imperialism and feudalism could not stop the progress of the revolution. Thirty years have passed. It is the Chinese people who have won, and it is imperialism, fascism, and feudalism, as well as their agents—warlords, landlords, compradors, bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and secret agents—who have been forever defeated.

The unbreakable friendship between the great People's Republic of China and the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is developing day by day, becoming the central force for defending world peace and the cause of people's democracy. Feudalism has been eliminated, and the broad masses of peasants are advancing with boundless confidence towards building a socialist agriculture. The Chinese working class is building a socialist industry, striving to realize the first five-year plan. Our people across the country should intensify their efforts to promote the early completion of this great five-year plan. After another two five-year plans, we will smoothly build a socialist society. The Communist Party has grown stronger and more consolidated, and it has become the core around which all democratic parties, all democratic classes, and other patriotic people are gathered, becoming the leader of the 600 million people of China. It is only the enemies of the people who have been forever defeated.

I lost Zhongkai in my family, which is an irreplaceable loss for me. But I have gained the friendship of the broad masses of the people, and the care of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and the democratic parties for me for thirty years. Although my family life has been disrupted, the comrades' love has strengthened my courage to fight. I have seen the victory of the revolution with my own eyes, and I have also seen the defeat of the enemies who killed Zhongkai and the millions of revolutionary martyrs. Although I feel infinite sorrow when I look back to this day thirty years ago, I feel infinite vitality in this old age of seventy-eight when I look back to the revolutionary struggle of the past thirty years, the glorious achievements of the revolutionary victory today, and when I look at the Chinese people of this generation full of confidence and a happy future. I feel that I am still young and have many things to do. Just like Zhongkai was in his lifetime, I want to learn from the Chinese working class, peasants, and the glorious Chinese Communist Party, and I want to learn from the Soviet Union. I will definitely follow the great Chairman Mao Zedong to make China far surpass my past ideals of "regulating capital and equalizing land rights" and realize the victorious socialist revolution. I myself feel confident that I will definitely be able to, together with the friends and comrades present, see with my own eyes China move from a socialist society to a communist society.

With Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party leading us, we are full of confidence in victory. Who else can stop our progress? The struggle of the people of the world to defend peace and strive for people's democracy is bound to win, and imperialism is inevitably going to decline. Taiwan is bound to be liberated, and the handful of counter-revolutionary elements hiding in Taiwan and the executioners who slaughtered the people's martyrs will one day be judged by the people. Socialism is bound to win, and the handful of counter-revolutionary elements who attempt to undermine this historical cause are bound to be crushed by the powerful forces of the people. Any imperialism that tries to intimidate us with artificially created tension and attempts to stop our progress is in vain.

Distinguished guests! Friends! What a soldier who dies on the battlefield expects from his comrades is to commemorate him with stronger battles and greater victories. The Chinese people have already achieved a brilliant victory. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people will achieve even greater victories. This is the best memorial for the eternally immortal pioneers on the Monument to the People's Heroes in Tiananmen Square, including Zhongkai.

Thank you all.

### 中国国民党革命委员会代表谭平山的讲话

　　中国国民党革命委员会代表谭平山的讲话同志们：
    廖仲恺先生在一九二五年八月二十日被当时国内反革命分子和帝国主义所暗害，到今天已经三十周年了。今天我们在这里举行纪念会，对于为中国民主革命英勇奋斗而牺牲的先烈廖仲恺先生，表示无限的崇敬和怀念。
    廖仲恺先生是孙中山先生的忠实信徒和有力助手，是中国人民反对帝国主义、封建主义斗争中的一个杰出的民主主义革命家和爱国主义者。他从一九○三年起就参加了孙中山先生所领导的革命斗争；他的革命活动是和孙中山先生对于中国革命的伟大贡献密切联系在一起的；在中国民主革命运动中起过重大的作用。
    一九二一年，中国工人阶级成立了自己的政党中国共产党，提出了反帝国主义、反封建主义的革命纲领和组织民族民主的革命统一战线的主张，并首先同孙中山先生建立了联系。近代中国的伟大的民主主义革命家孙中山先生，在工人阶级登上历史舞台，成为中国革命的中心力量的时候，他首先承认了这个力量，接受社会主义苏联和中国工人阶级的援助，决定采取联合苏联、联合共产党、扶助工人运动和农民运动的革命三大政策，决心改组中国国民党。这是孙中山先生革命事业中的一个巨大的跃进。而当时中国的封建势力和买办资产阶级则进一步地投靠帝国主义，残酷地奴役中国人民，镇压民众运动，企图扑灭中国革命的火焰。这一革命与反革命的斗争尖锐地反映在中国国民党党内。当时中国国民党内的右派反动分子们执行地主阶级、买办资产阶级和帝国主义的意志，猛烈攻击三大政策，反对改组国民党。作为孙中山先生的有力助手，廖仲恺先生坚决促成和推动革命三大政策。在中国国民党进行改组的激烈斗争中，廖仲恺先生竭力协助孙中山先生，击败了反动分子的阻挠和破坏，在中国共产党的具体帮助和直接参加下，终于在一九二四年初召开了中国国民党第一次全国代表大会，改组了中国国民党，发表了著名的中国国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言，确定了当时革命的行动纲领，形成了中国革命运动中的第一次的统一战线。
    廖仲恺先生是革命三大政策最坚决的执行者。他以中国国民党中央常务委员兼工人部长和农民部长的身份，深入群众，积极地赞助工人运动和农民运动，维护工农利益。他曾说：“哪一派代表大多数人民的利益便为革命派，哪一派反对较多人民的利益便为反革命派。……官僚军阀与帝国主义是我们全国人民的公敌；哪一派人代表民众来打消这两种力量便是革命派。占我国人口最多的是农工阶级；哪一派替农工阶级打消压迫他们的力量也是革命派。反而言之，凡与军阀帝国主义者妥协并压迫农工的人们便是反革命派。”这清楚地说明廖仲恺先生是站在工农大众一边、坚决反对帝国主义和封建势力的。
    当时以广东为根据地的革命力量蓬勃地发展起来了，在全国范围内掀起反对帝国主义、封建主义的浪潮。国际帝国主义和当时国内的封建、买办资产阶级知道中国人民革命的胜利就是它们的失败，因此更进一步地互相勾结起来，采取各种公开的和暗害的手段来破坏中国人民的革命事业，反对中国人民的革命运动，发动了一系列的事变，如帝国主义炮舰为阻挠广东截留关余开到白鹅潭进行威吓，如以买办陈廉伯为首的广州商团事件，都是帝国主义和封建买办资产阶级对当时革命根据地的联合进攻，企图以里应外合的手段来缢杀中国人民的革命。廖仲恺先生和孙中山先生一道，在革命人民的支持下，坚决反击了国内外反动派的联合进攻，巩固了当时在广东的革命根据地。
    一九二五年三月十二日孙中山先生逝世了，全国人民对这位伟大革命家的哀悼，形成了新的革命高潮，廖仲恺先生坚决地肩负起贯彻革命的三大政策的责任，忠实地执行孙中山先生的遗嘱，在镇压与帝国主义相勾结的杨希闵、刘震寰叛变阴谋事件中，在支持中国工人阶级反对帝国主义的省港大罢工的长期斗争中，廖仲恺先生都采取了坚决的革命政策，给予了反革命势力以严重的打击。大家知道，革命三大政策是当时全国革命人民的共同行动纲领，是当时中国共产党和中国国民党合作的政治基础，国内外反动势力，要破坏当时中国人民的革命大团结，自然十分仇恨忠实于三大政策的廖仲恺先生。在三十年前的今天，廖仲恺先生终于被国内外的反革命势力用最卑鄙的手段暗害了。廖仲恺先生遇难后，反革命两面派的蒋介石就阴谋篡夺了中国国民党的领导权，在北伐战争胜利的中途，暴露了他的狰狞面目，背叛了三大政策，背叛了革命，使第一次国内革命遭到了失败。
    廖仲恺先生逝世已经三十周年了。三十年来，我们的国家经历了巨大的变化。在伟大的中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，经过第二次国内革命战争、抗日战争和第三次国内革命战争，中国人民终于在一九四九年取得了反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的人民革命的伟大胜利，结束了长期被压迫、被奴役的历史，建立了人民民主专政的中华人民共和国，完成了中国革命第一阶段的任务。中华人民共和国成立以来，全国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，做着我们前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。我国的国际地位空前提高，国防力量空前强大，人民民主政权空前巩固，现在全国人民正积极为实现伟大的第一个五年计划而奋斗，要把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。我国与苏联结成了牢不可破的友好同盟，和所有的人民民主国家有着兄弟般的友谊，与全世界爱好和平的国家和人民一道，共同为保卫世界和平而斗争。三十年前廖仲恺先生不惜流血牺牲求其实现的理想，不但已经全部成为现实，而且远远超过了！这是我们今天纪念廖仲恺先生，足以告慰于先烈的。
    我们今天在这里纪念廖仲恺先生，我们必须从廖仲恺先生的遇害记取教训，百倍地提高警惕，加强当前反对内外敌人的斗争，坚决彻底地肃清胡风反革命集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子。在这里，我更要向中国国民党革命委员会的同志们指出：必须认识实现第一个五年计划是一场极其尖锐、激烈、复杂的阶级斗争，要随时警惕着敌人的破坏。
    我们今天在这里纪念廖仲恺先生，对于背叛孙中山先生和廖仲恺先生的卖国贼蒋介石继续在美帝国主义的支持下盘踞台湾，感到无比的愤怒！我们必须从各方面加强工作，为解放台湾进行不懈的斗争。跟随蒋贼介石逃到台湾的人们，有些人是深知廖仲恺先生的革命主张和革命品质的，有些人是亲身受过廖仲恺先生的教育的；今天是廖仲恺先生被害三十周年纪念日，这些人们应该沉痛反省跟随蒋贼背叛革命的错误，认识蒋贼一贯是孙中山先生和廖仲恺先生的叛徒，是全国人民的公敌，希望他们能够及早地觉悟过来，脱离蒋介石卖国集团，争取弃暗投明，立功赎罪，回到祖国怀抱。廖仲恺先生的夫人何香凝的讲话主席，各位先生，各位朋友！
    在仲恺逝世三十周年的纪念日上，各位同志，各位朋友们举行盛大的纪念会，这是仲恺的莫大的光荣。仲恺不过是过去几十年来中国革命中牺牲的千千万万个烈士中的一个。诸位朋友们今天给予他的光荣，应该是属于近百年来艰苦地为中国的独立自由而奋斗的全体中国人民的，属于千千万万个为伟大的中国革命而流血的全体烈士们的。作为中国革命中一个普通士兵的家属，我谨向各位朋友们同志们表示诚挚的感谢。
    仲恺一直到他生命的最后的一刻，忠实不渝于孙中山先生的“联合苏联、以俄为师”“扶助工人运动、扶助农民运动”“联合中国共产党”的革命三大政策，反抗帝国主义侵略并为这个革命主张付出了他的生命。三十年前的今天，仲恺为法西斯主义者所暗害。人民的敌人虽然夺取了仲恺一个人的生命，但是帝国主义、封建主义并不能阻挡革命的前进。三十年过去了。胜利了的是中国人民，而永远失败了的正是帝国主义、法西斯主义和封建主义，以及他们的代理人——军阀、地主、买办、官僚资产阶级和特务流氓。
    伟大的中华人民共和国和伟大的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的牢不可破的友谊，正在日益发展，成为保卫世界和平与人民民主事业的中心力量。封建主义消灭了，广大的农民正以无限信心朝着建设社会主义的农业前进。中国的工人阶级正在建设着社会主义的工业，为实现第一个五年计划而奋斗。我们全国人民应该加紧努力，促进这个伟大的五年计划早日完成。再经两个五年计划之后，顺利地建成社会主义社会。共产党壮大了，巩固了，它成为中国各民主党派，各民主阶级，其他爱国人士所围绕着的核心，成为中国六万万人民的领导者。永远失败了的只是人民的敌人。
    我在家庭中失去了仲恺，这对我是不可补偿的损失。但是我得到了广大人民的友谊，得到了光荣的中国共产党、民主党派三十年来对我的爱护。我的家庭生活虽然被破坏了，但是同志们的友爱更增强了我斗争的勇气。我以自己的眼睛看到了革命的胜利，并且也看到了杀害仲恺和千千万万革命烈士的敌人的失败。虽然在回顾到三十年前的今天我感到无限的悲痛，但在回顾到三十年来的革命斗争，今天的光辉的革命胜利的成果，和望着中国这一代充满着信心与幸福前途的中国人民时，我又在这七十八岁的老年中感到无限的生命力。我觉得自己还是青年，还有许多事情要做，正如仲恺生前那样，要向中国工人阶级、农民和光荣的中国共产党学习，要向苏联学习，我一定追随着伟大的毛泽东主席，使中国远远超越我过去怀抱的“节制资本、平均地权”的理想而实现胜利的社会主义革命。我自己感到有信心，我一定能和在座朋友们同志们一起，用我自己的眼睛，看到中国由社会主义社会进入共产主义社会。
    有毛泽东主席和中国共产党领导着我们，我们充满着胜利的信心。谁再能阻挡我们的前进呢？全世界人民保卫和平、争取人民民主的斗争是一定要胜利的，帝国主义是不可避免地要没落的。台湾是一定要解放的，躲在台湾的一小撮反革命分子和屠杀人民烈士的刽子手们，终有一日要受到人民的审判的。社会主义一定要胜利，企图破坏这一历史事业的一小撮反革命分子是一定要被强大的人民力量所粉碎的。任何帝国主义想用人工造成的紧张局势来威吓我们，企图阻挡我们的进路，那是徒劳的。
    各位先生！各位朋友！一个战死在战场上的兵士所期望于他的战友们的：是用更坚强的战斗和更大的胜利来纪念他。中国人民已经取得了光辉的胜利。在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，中国人民将取得更大的胜利。这就是我们对天安门前人民英雄纪念碑上的永垂不朽的先烈们，包括仲恺在内的最好纪念。
    感谢诸位。
