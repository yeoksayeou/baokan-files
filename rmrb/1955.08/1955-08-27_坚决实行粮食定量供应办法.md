　　Resolutely Implement the Grain Rationing Method
    According to the order of the State Council, the grain rationing method for towns and cities is about to be implemented. This method is more reasonable than the current method of verifying supply by household. After the implementation of this method, the grain consumed by urban residents will be rationed according to the labor difference and age of the residents, divided into different grades and categories. Grain used by industry and trades will be supplied in appropriate quantities according to their normal and actual needs, after being approved by the unit's plan and the competent authority. Urban livestock feed will be planned by each business household according to regulations, and supplied in fixed quantities after approval. This method of grain distribution is the most reasonable in my country's current situation.
    The direct purpose of implementing grain rationing is to improve the planning of grain supply work, to distribute grain needed by urban residents and other aspects more rationally, so as to eliminate waste and save grain. After my country implemented the unified purchase and sale of grain in the autumn of 1953, the free grain market was abolished, and the speculation and manipulation of grain merchants were effectively restricted; facts have proved that this is the decisive factor in stabilizing the grain market and ensuring grain supply. However, due to the excessively broad urban supply plan, lax management, and lack of strict systems, grain waste has not been effectively curbed, and the amount of grain sales has continued to increase, reaching far beyond the level of last year and the year before in the spring of this year. For example, comparing the first quarter of 1955 with the first quarter of 1954, the population of Beijing increased by 14%, but the grain sales increased by 35%, of which 21% was not due to the increase in population. In the period from 1953 to 1954, the grain supply in Beijing was already very sufficient, and it was obviously inappropriate to increase the sales volume a lot on this basis. This trend is roughly the same in other towns and cities across the country, and the situation is very serious. In March and April of this year, all cities and towns across the country successively carried out publicity on saving grain, and then implemented the method of grain supply based on household verification. This method effectively compressed the grain sales volume in cities and towns. According to statistics from 238 cities, the grain sales volume in June decreased by 8% compared with May, and continued to decrease in July and August; moreover, due to the preliminary clarification of the population and the grain demand of residents in various occupations, it laid the foundation for the implementation of the rationing method.
    However, the method of verifying supply by household is only a transitional method after all, and it cannot completely eliminate the phenomenon of wasting grain. It is enough to cite one fact: In July, Shanghai verified a total of 210 million jin of grain for residents, collective catering units, and other aspects, but only 200.1 million jin were actually sold; even of those that had been sold, there were still excessive and unreasonable portions. This is because the grain consumption plans of some residents are still too high after verification; some public and educational personnel and employees both join collective catering units and purchase grain repeatedly at home; the phenomenon of grain outflow and private sales of grain reproductions still exists. Moreover, when implementing the method of verifying supply by household, residents' grain consumption plans must be verified every month, and the procedures are cumbersome, which should also be improved. In order to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and develop agricultural production, the state has decided that the number of grain purchases in the future should be less than that of 1954-1955, and will remain stable for three years. Therefore, it is necessary to strive to compress the unreasonable grain sales volume in urban and rural areas, especially the unreasonable grain sales volume in cities and towns, so as to more effectively balance the national grain supply and demand plan. Grain rationing is precisely the most effective way to compress and stabilize grain sales volume and overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings.
    Why is it said that the rationing method is a good method for distributing grain that is suitable for my country's current conditions? This is because this method is meticulous. It stipulates that residents must strictly "ration by person" when purchasing grain, which eliminates the phenomenon of repeated purchases and fraudulent claims. This method is relatively reasonable. It determines appropriate rationing standards according to the different labor and age of residents, which overcomes the problem of unreasonable rationing in the supply based on household verification. This method is scientific. It accurately assesses the grain supply grades of residents and supplies them on time according to regulations, which eliminates the monthly verification work and procedures in the supply based on household verification. This method also has great positive effects. It fixes the grain supply volume of residents, promotes residents to formulate reasonable life plans, use it well and effectively save their grain.
    The superiority of the grain rationing method implemented in our country is also prominently manifested in the rationality of the supply quantity and supply method it stipulates. The rations for urban residents are stipulated according to the labor difference and age, that is, according to the actual needs of residents for grain. Necessary care has been taken for workers who engage in particularly heavy physical labor, staff members below the county and district level, and college and middle school students, and the amount of grain supply has been appropriately increased. For industrial and handicraft grain consumption, cooked food, reproduction food and other industries, appropriate supply is carried out according to the normal needs of production and society, as well as the different grain consumption levels in the slack and peak seasons of various industries. This method can save grain for the country on the one hand, and ensure the necessary supply in all aspects under the principle of saving on the other hand. There is no doubt that it will have a positive impact on industrial and agricultural production.
    After the promulgation of the grain rationing method for towns and cities, it was immediately supported by the majority of urban residents. People have seen that the implementation of this method is beneficial to the country and to the vast majority of urban residents, and only unfavorable to a very small number of bad people, who can no longer fraudulently claim more purchases, hoard and steal transportation, and can no longer harm others to benefit themselves and steal public property to enrich themselves. However, the loss suffered by these people is precisely the interest of the country and the interest of the vast majority of the people.
    Of course, we must also sufficiently estimate the arduousness and complexity of implementing this method. We should tell all urban residents and make them understand that when the free market is dominant, unscrupulous merchants are free to hoard, speculate, raise prices, and lower prices, but poor residents do not have the power to freely purchase grain. During a period of soaring grain prices before liberation, many public and educational personnel and employees received wages in the morning that could buy a斗(dǒu) of rice, but could only buy a升(shēng) of rice in the evening. Everyone will still remember that suffering. Now this kind of suffering is gone, but some people are interested in the "free" form of purchasing grain before liberation. They are afraid that after the implementation of grain rationing, there will not be "enough to eat", or they think that this is "not free" and "inconvenient". We must make it clear that the standards stipulated by the state are reasonable and sufficient. The state supplies grain according to plan, and residents purchase grain on time and in fixed quantities. There is no worry about food. This is the greatest freedom, this is the real freedom. After the implementation of grain rationing, it is necessary to go through certain procedures for travel, relocation, and purchase of certain grain products, even if there are some "inconveniences"; however, these "inconveniences" are insignificant compared to the great interests of saving grain and building socialism. We should consciously bear this "inconvenience" and complete the great cause of building socialism. Moreover, habits can be changed. Over time, we will gradually become familiar with it, and we will slowly not feel any "inconvenience".
    During the period when the grain rationing method for towns and cities is first implemented, all towns, cities, and industrial and mining areas should, without exception, launch a large-scale publicity campaign to explain the significance, purpose, and role of grain rationing to the residents, so that they fully understand this method. It is of great significance for ensuring the country's socialist construction, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and ensuring the grain supply in cities and towns. They should consciously abide by it and resolutely implement it. On the basis of doing a good job in publicity and mobilization, we should also carry out large-scale organizational work. The responsible persons of all agencies, organizations, enterprises, troops, and schools must earnestly take responsibility, find out the number of people in their respective agencies, divide the supply grades, and purchase grain in strict accordance with the regulations, and strive to become a model for implementing the grain rationing method. The residents' committees or residents' groups in towns and cities should shoulder important tasks, assist the government and street offices, find out the local population, assess the supply grades, and explain various difficult questions. Industrial and commercial operators should strictly abide by the laws and regulations of the country, purchase and use grain according to the needs of normal operation, and thoroughly overcome the problems of speculation and waste. The grain work departments of towns and cities should, under the leadership of the Party committee and the government, earnestly do a good job in the business work related to grain supply, especially the work of adjusting grain varieties. The Party committee's high attention and specific leadership are the key to the smooth development of this work. The Party committees in towns, cities, and industrial and mining areas must allocate a certain amount of time, concentrate sufficient cadres, go deep into the masses, carry out arduous and meticulous work, and correctly implement the grain rationing work.
    In the grain rationing, every patriotic and law-abiding urban resident should not only consciously abide by this method, but also urge others to abide by this method, vigilantly pay attention to and effectively combat the rumors and sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements, and help the government to smoothly implement the rationing of grain in towns and cities.

　　坚决实行粮食定量供应办法
    按照国务院的命令，市镇粮食定量供应办法就要开始实行了。这种办法比现行的按户核实供应办法更加合理。这个办法实行以后，市镇居民食用的粮食，就要按照居民的劳动差别和年龄大小，分等分类定量供应。工业和行业用粮则按照它们正常和实际的需要，经过本单位的计划和主管机关的批准，适量供应。城镇牲畜饲料由各业户按照规定编制计划，经过批准定量供应。这种粮食分配办法，在我国目前情况下是最合理的。
    实行粮食定量供应的直接目的是提高粮食供应工作的计划性，更合理地分配市镇居民和其他方面需要的粮食，以便杜绝浪费，节约粮食。我国从一九五三年秋季开始实行粮食统购统销以后，取消了粮食的自由市场，有效地限制了粮商的投机操纵；事实证明，这是稳定粮食市场、保证粮食供应的决定因素。但是，由于城市供应计划偏宽，管理松懈而又缺乏严格的制度，以致粮食浪费未被有效制止，粮食销售数量继续增加，到今年春季，竟远远超过去年和前年的水平。如以一九五五年第一季度同一九五四年第一季度相比，北京市人口增加了百分之十四，粮食销售量却增加了百分之三十五，其中的百分之二十一不是因为人口增加而多销了的。一九五三到一九五四年度，北京市的粮食供应量已很充裕，在这个基础上增加了很多销售量，显然是很不应该的。这种趋势在全国其他市镇也大致相同，情况十分严重。今年三、四月间，全国各市镇相继进行了节约粮食的宣传，接着实行了粮食按户核实供应的办法。这种办法有效地压缩了市镇的粮食销售量，据二三八个城市统计，六月份粮食销售量比五月份减少了百分之八，七、八月份续有减少；而且，由于初步查清了人口，摸清了各种不同职业的居民的粮食需要量，为实行定量供应办法奠定了基础。
    但是，按户核实供应办法毕竟还只是过渡性的办法，它还不可能完全消灭浪费粮食的现象。只要举出这样一件事实就够了：上海市七月份核实的居民、集体伙食单位和其他方面的用粮计划共二亿一千万斤，实际只销售了二亿零一百多万斤；就是已经销售了的，也还有过多的和不合理的部分。这是因为有些居民的用粮计划经过核实还是偏高；某些公教人员和职工既在集体伙食单位入伙，又在家庭重复购粮；粮食外流和私贩粮食复制品的现象也依然存在。而且，在实行按户核实供应办法的时候，居民的用粮计划要每月核实，手续繁多，这也应该加以改进。国家为了巩固工农联盟，发展农业生产，已经确定今后征购粮食的数字要少于一九五四—一九五五年度，并且稳定三年不变。因此必须努力压缩城乡不合理的粮食销售量，特别是市镇不合理的粮食销售量，以便更有效地平衡全国粮食供求计划。粮食定量供应正是压缩和稳定粮食销售量和克服上述缺点的最有效的办法。
    为什么说定量供应办法是适合我国当前条件的一种良好的分配粮食的办法呢？这是因为这种办法是周密的，它规定居民购买粮食必须严格地“以人定量”，这就消灭了重购冒领的现象。这种办法是比较合理的，它依照居民不同的劳动和年龄，确定适当的定量标准，这就克服了按户核实供应中所存在的定量不尽合理的毛病。这种办法是科学的，它把居民的粮食供应等别评准，依照规章按时供应，这就免去了按户核实供应中月月核实的工作和手续。这种办法还有很大的积极作用，它把居民的粮食供应量固定下来，推动居民制定合理的生活计划，好好地使用和有效地节约自己的粮食。
    我们国家实行的粮食定量供应办法的优越性，还从它所规定的供应数量和供应办法的合情合理上突出地表现了出来。市镇居民的口粮是按照劳动差别和年龄大小，也就是按照居民对于粮食的实际需要规定的。对于工人中的特重体力劳动者，国家工作人员中的县区以下的工作人员，学生中的大中学生，都作了必要的照顾，适当地增加了粮食供应量。对于工业和手工业用粮，熟食、复制食品等行业用粮，根据生产和社会的正常需要，以及各行业淡季、旺季不同的用粮水平，进行适当的供应。这种办法一方面能为国家节约粮食，一方面能在节约的原则下保证各方面必需的供应，它对工农业生产必然会发生积极的影响，这是没有疑问的。
    市镇粮食定量供应办法公布以后，立即得到了广大市镇居民的拥护。人们都看到实行这种办法，对国家有利，对绝大多数市镇居民有利，只对极少数坏人不利，他们再不能冒领多购、囤积盗运，再不能损人利己、盗公肥私了。可是，这些人所受的损失，正是国家的利益，正是绝大多数人民的利益。
    当然，我们也必须足够地估计实行这个办法的艰巨性和复杂性。我们应该告诉所有市镇的居民，使他们了解：在自由市场占统治地位的时候，奸商囤积、投机、抬价、杀价是自由的，贫苦居民却没有自由购买粮食的力量。解放以前粮价暴涨的一个时期，不少公教人员和职工早晨拿到能买一斗米的工薪，到晚上只能买一升米，那种苦楚大家都还会记得。现在这种苦楚是没有了，可是却有些人对于解放前的那种“自由”购买粮食的形式感到兴趣。他们害怕实行粮食定量供应以后会“不够吃”，或者认为这样“不自由”、“不方便”。我们必须说清楚：国家规定的标准是合理的，是够用的。国家按计划供应粮食，居民按期按定量购买粮食，食用无虞，这是最大的自由，这是真正的自由。实行粮食定量供应以后，旅行、迁移、购买一定的粮食制成品，必须履行一定的手续，即使有些“不方便”；但是，这些“不方便”同节约粮食建设社会主义的远大利益比较起来，乃是微不足道的。我们应该自觉地承受这种“不方便”，完成建设社会主义的大事业。况且，习惯是可以改变的，日子长了，逐渐熟悉，慢慢就不会感觉有什么“不方便”了。
    在开始实行市镇粮食定量供应办法的一个时期，各市镇和工矿区应该毫无例外地展开一个大规模的宣传运动，把粮食定量供应的意义、目的和作用向居民解释清楚，使他们完全懂得这种办法对于保证国家的社会主义建设、巩固工农联盟和保证市镇粮食供应的重大作用，自觉遵守，坚决实行。在做好宣传鼓动工作的基础上，我们还应该进行大规模的组织工作。各机关、团体、企业、部队、学校的负责人员，要切实负起责任，把所属机关的人数查清，供应等别分好，严格按照规定购领粮食，争取成为执行粮食定量供应办法的模范。市镇的居民委员会或居民小组要担负起重要的任务，协助政府和街道办事处，查清当地人口，评定供应等别，解释各种疑难问题。工商业者应该严格遵照国家的法令，根据正常经营的需要，购买和使用粮食，彻底克服投机和浪费的毛病。市镇的粮食工作部门要在党委和政府领导下，切实做好有关粮食供应的业务工作，特别是调剂粮食品种的工作。党委的高度重视和具体领导是顺利开展这一工作的关键。市镇和工矿区的党委必须划出一定的时间，集中足够的干部，深入群众，进行艰苦、细致的工作，把粮食定量供应工作正确地贯彻下去。
    在粮食定量供应中，每一个爱国守法的市镇居民，不但自己应该自觉地遵守这个办法，还应该督促别人也遵守这个办法，警惕地注意和有效地打击反革命分子的造谣破坏，帮助政府顺利地实行市镇粮食的定量供应。
