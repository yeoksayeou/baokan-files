    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 16th - According to Vietnam News Agency's Lao dispatch: On August 13th, the Lao Kingdom's army once again launched fierce military offensives against the Lao fighting units' assembly areas of Baka and Huaiya near Muang Phoune in Sam Neua province. In order to defend themselves and protect the lives and property of the local residents, the Lao fighting units were forced to resist.
    According to the latest news, the Kingdom army was forced to withdraw from Huaiya on August 13th.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th - The Lao "Liberation News" published a commentary on August 15th regarding the Lao Kingdom Government's continued offensives against the Lao fighting units' assembly areas.
    The commentary stated that while the political and military conferences between the two sides were being held, the Lao Kingdom army continuously attacked the Lao fighting units around Muang Phoune in Sam Neua province at the beginning of August. At the same time, the military delegation of the Kingdom Government continuously raised unreasonable demands regarding the issue of garrison areas within Sam Neua province at the military conference.
    The commentary pointed out that it is worth noting that at the military conference on August 4th, the military delegation of the Kingdom Government demanded that the locations where they were allowed to station troops completely match the attack targets of Major Sang's military plan, which was seized by the Lao fighting units.
    "Liberation News" further pointed out that, on the other hand, at the political conference, the political delegation of the Kingdom Government stubbornly insisted on resolving the issue of the two provinces before the general election. On August 11th, they sent a letter to the Lao fighting units' delegation, stating that they could not accept any amendments to the election law proposed by the Lao fighting units in accordance with the spirit of the Geneva Accords. The letter unreasonably demanded that the Lao fighting units disarm and that the Kingdom Government must establish its regime in the two provinces. The commentary said that, obviously, such an attitude and demands are closely related to the aforementioned military offensive plan.
    The commentary said that these are all serious violations of the Geneva Accords. It makes us feel that the Kingdom Government has no sincerity in negotiations, and merely uses the political and military conferences as a shield to cover up its military offensives against the two provinces where the Lao fighting units are assembled.
    The commentary said that more than a year has passed since the signing of the Lao ceasefire agreement, but the sound of gunfire in Laos has not stopped to this day because the Kingdom Government army continues to occupy the two provinces of the Lao fighting units. This is a serious threat to peace in Laos, Indochina, and Southeast Asia.
    The commentary concluded by saying that the Lao people are determined to unite and struggle to crush the vicious schemes of US imperialism and its followers, and for the peace, democracy, unity, and independence of Laos.

    就老挝王国政府军队继续进攻寮国战斗部队集结区问题
    老挝“解放报”斥责王国政府没有谈判诚意
    新华社河内十六日电　据越南通讯社老挝消息：八月十三日，老挝王国军队再次向寮国战斗部队的集结区桑怒省芒奔附近的巴卡和会雅的寮国战斗部队发动猛烈的军事进攻。寮国战斗部队为了自卫和保障当地居民的生命财产，被迫进行抵抗。
    据最新消息，王国军队已经在八月十三日被迫撤出会雅。
    新华社河内十八日电　老挝“解放报”八月十五日就老挝王国政府继续进攻寮国战斗部队集结区一事发表评论。
    评论说，在双方的政治会议和军事会议举行的时候，八月初老挝王国军队又连续地向桑怒省芒奔周围地区的寮国战斗部队进攻。同时，王国政府军事代表团在军事会议上连续就在桑怒省内驻军地区问题提出不合理的要求。
    评论指出，值得注意的是八月四日的军事会议上，王国政府军事代表团要求让他们驻扎军队的地点和被寮国战斗部队缴获的桑少校军事计划的进攻目标完全符合。
    “解放报”又指出，另一方面，在政治会议上，王国政府政治代表团仍然顽固地要求在普选前先解决两省问题。八月十一日，他们又给寮国战斗部队代表团一封信，说他们不能接受寮国战斗部队的为符合于日内瓦协定的精神而提出的对选举法的任何修正。信中无理地要求寮国战斗部队解除武装，并且必须让王国政府在两省内建立政权。评论说，显然的，这样的态度和要求和上述军事进攻计划有着密切的关系。
    评论说，这些都非常严重地违反了日内瓦协定。它使我们感到王国政府没有一点谈判诚意，只不过是把政治会议和军事会议作为掩盖它对寮国战斗部队所集结的两省进行军事进攻的盾牌。
    评论说，老挝停战协定签订一年多了，但是由于王国政府军队继续侵占寮国战斗部队的两省，所以老挝的枪声至今仍未停止。这对老挝、印度支那和东南亚的和平是严重的威胁。
    评论最后说，老挝人民决心团结一致，为粉碎美帝国主义及其追随者的恶毒阴谋，为老挝的和平、民主、统一、独立而斗争。
