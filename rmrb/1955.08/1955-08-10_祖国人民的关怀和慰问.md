The people of the motherland enthusiastically express their solicitude and sympathy to the People's Liberation Army commanders and fighters on the Zhejiang front. Tens of thousands of letters and gifts of sympathy are constantly sent to the front line of coastal defense.

According to statistics from the Political Department of the Zhejiang Military Region: in the seven months from the end of 1954 to July this year alone, more than 227,000 letters of sympathy and more than 670 greeting cards were received. Along with the letters of sympathy came all kinds of precious gifts. As of July 15, more than 27,800 various gifts of sympathy had been received, including more than 50 kinds of items such as books and magazines, sympathy bags, diaries, banners, medals, cigarettes, pens, leather suitcases, candies, towels, handkerchiefs, pillowcases, photos, books, toothbrushes, toothpaste, and plant seeds.

The letters and gifts of sympathy came from the Kangzang Plateau, from the South China Sea coast, from Anshan, the steel capital of the motherland, and from Yan'an, the sacred place of the revolution. Herdsmen from the Inner Mongolia grasslands wrote congratulatory letters, and oil workers from Yumen sent books. Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers far away in Korea, and Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, also sent congratulatory letters and gifts from afar.

Tens of thousands of letters and gifts of sympathy express the sincere feelings of the people of the whole country in loving the motherland and the People's Liberation Army, and the firm determination to liberate Taiwan. All the staff and workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Small Rolling Mill said in a letter to the front-line soldiers: "The victory news of the liberation of Yijiangshan Island was very exciting for us. In an instant, the Party organization received more than 100 letters of determination. Everyone guarantees to roll more steel and create wealth for the motherland, resolutely support the struggle to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands. Whatever the front line needs, we will supply it." All the workers of a command post of the Dongting Lake dyke construction project packed the cigarettes given to them by the farmers of Dongting Lake into two small wooden boxes and sent them to the coastal defense front line. They wrote in the accompanying letter: "Please accept this gift that should be received! This is the honor gained from building the dyke under your protection." The farmers gave their agricultural product specimens to the soldiers, saying: "This is the fruit of labor obtained under your protection." Young students enthusiastically collected tree seeds and flower seeds to send to the front line. A class in a middle school in Nanjing said in a letter to the soldiers: "Comrades, when these seeds are planted around your positions, sprout, and bloom into flowers, how happy we should be!" Thousands of Young Pioneers presented their beloved red scarves. Zhang Yunwei, a Young Pioneer from Shanghai No. 3 Girls' Middle School, wrote on the red scarf: "Red scarf, red scarf, the scarf is as red as the heart, I give you the scarf! It represents my heart." Housewives from Mashi Street in the Zhongcheng District of Hangzhou made sixty sympathy bags, and in mid-April, they beat gongs and drums to send them to the Political Department of the Zhejiang Military Region. In their letter to the coastal defense troops, they wrote: "Although our gifts of sympathy are few, they are all sewn by hand. They represent the high respect and sincere sympathy of all the women in Mashi Street for you." More than 1,600 female students from Hangzhou Girls' Middle School launched a campaign of one sympathy item per person. In order to make the gifts of sympathy more meaningful, the students proposed: "Make it with your own hands, exchange gifts with your own labor." Yu Shangzhong, a worker at the Heilongjiang Riveting and Welding Repair Plant, used the bonus he received for improving his tools to buy twelve gold pens to give to front-line heroes.

The enthusiastic letters of sympathy and precious gifts of sympathy greatly encouraged the front-line soldiers. The broad masses of commanders and fighters once again received a vivid and profound patriotic education from the people. Many units held exhibitions of gifts and letters of sympathy. A unit that participated in the battle to liberate Yijiangshan Island also transported the exhibits to the scattered companies for a touring exhibition. The commanders and fighters never tired of reading the thousands of letters of sympathy from their loved ones, and carefully collected the gifts one by one. They deeply felt that each gift and each letter was a force to encourage their progress and support their struggle. The Seventh Company of a certain unit wrote in a letter to a class of students at Hangzhou Girls' Middle School in Zhejiang: "We have read the letters of sympathy you sent more than once and excitedly. We know that this is not an ordinary letter, it is thousands of hearts, thousands of wills and wishes. We must liberate Taiwan, this is the voice of 600 million people. With your support, we have the confidence, the confidence, and the strength to complete the glorious task entrusted to us by the motherland."

    祖国人民的关怀和慰问
    张重天
    祖国各地人民热情慰问浙江前线的人民解放军指战员，千千万万件慰问信、慰问品源源不断地寄到海防前线。
    据浙江军区政治部统计：仅一九五四年年底到今年七月的七个多月中，就收到慰问信二十二万七千多封，贺年片六百七十多份。随着一封封的慰问信，附来了各种珍贵的礼品。截至七月十五日止，共收到各种慰问礼品二万七千八百多件，其中有图书杂志、慰问袋、日记本、锦旗、奖章、香烟、钢笔、皮箧、糖果、毛巾、手帕、枕套、照片、图书、牙刷、牙膏、植物种子等物品五十多种。
    慰问信、慰问品，有的来自康藏高原；有的来自南海边；有的来自祖国的钢都鞍山；有的来自革命的圣地延安。内蒙古草原的牧民写来了贺信，玉门的石油工人寄来了书本。远在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军战士，在苏联和其他人民民主国家学习的我国留学生，也不远千里地寄来了贺信和礼品。
    千万件慰问信、慰问品，表达了全国人民热爱祖国、热爱人民解放军的亲切心情和一定要解放台湾的坚决意志。鞍钢小型轧钢厂全体职工在给前线战士的信中说：“解放一江山岛的胜利消息传来，使我们十分振奋，一霎时，党组织就收到一百多份决心书。大家保证一定要多轧钢材，为祖国创造财富，坚决支援解放台湾和沿海岛屿的斗争，前线需要什么，我们就供应什么。”洞庭湖修堤工程某指挥部的全体工人，把洞庭湖岸农民慰问他们的香烟分装两个小木箱寄往海防前线，他们附信中写道：“请收下这份应该收得的礼品吧！这是在你们保卫下修堤获得的荣誉。”农民们把自己的农产标本赠给战士，说：“这是在你们保卫下获得的劳动成果。”青年学生们热情地收集树种、花种寄往前线。南京某中学一个班给战士的信中说：“同志们，当你们阵地周围种上这些种子，长出芽，开起鲜花时，你说我们该是多么高兴啊！”千百个少年先锋队员献上了心爱的红领巾。上海第三女中少年先锋队员张云薇在红领巾上写道：“红领巾、红领巾，领巾红得好似心，我把领巾献给你啊！表示我的一颗心。”杭州市中城区马市街的家庭妇女做了六十个慰问袋，四月中旬，她们敲着锣打着鼓把它送到了浙江军区政治部。在她们给海防部队的信上写着：“我们的慰问品虽然很少，但这都是亲手缝制的，它代表了我们马市街全体妇女对你们的崇高的敬意和亲切的慰问。”杭州女子中学的一千六百多个女学生展开了每人一件慰问品运动，同学们为了使慰问品更有意义，她们提出：“用自己的手做，用自己的劳动去换来礼品。”黑龙江铆焊修配厂的工人于尚忠把自己改进工具得来的奖金买了十二支金笔赠给前线英雄。
    热情的慰问信、珍贵的慰问品，极大地鼓舞了前线战士，广大指战员们又一次受到了来自人民的、生动的、深刻的爱国主义教育。许多单位举行了慰问品、慰问信展览会，参加解放一江山岛战斗的某部，还把展览品运到分散的连队巡回展览。指战员们读不厌来自亲人的千百封慰问信，又把一件件的礼品小心翼翼地收藏起来。他们深深感到一件礼品、一封信都是鼓励自己进步，支持自己斗争的力量。某部七连在给浙江杭州女中一个班的同学的信中写道：“我们不止一次地、激动地读着你们寄来的慰问信，我们知道，这不是一封平常的信，这是千千万万颗心，千千万万个意志和愿望。一定要解放台湾，这是六亿人民的声音。有着你们的支持，我们有把握、有信心、有力量完成祖国交与的光荣任务。”
