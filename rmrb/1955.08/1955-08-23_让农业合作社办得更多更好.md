Let Agricultural Cooperatives Be Run More and Better
　　Deng Mangong

　　"Socialism is paradise,
　　Cooperatives are the ladder to heaven.
　　The direction must be right,
　　People must be of one mind;
　　Step by step upwards,
　　Power is boundless."

    This is a new folk song circulating among the masses of farmers in Jiaozhou, Shandong. This is the truth discovered by the farmers based on their personal experience. From this folk song, we can see how clearly the broad masses of farmers understand the benefits of agricultural production cooperatives. They are taking the road of collectivization in batches and have already obtained significant practical benefits. This is another great turnaround for them after national liberation and the implementation of land reform.

    The farmers have every reason to have unlimited confidence in the direction of agricultural collectivization. Taking Jiaozhou Prefecture as an example, according to statistics from the spring of this year, the prefecture already has 8,812 agricultural production cooperatives, with 192,552 farm households joining, accounting for 22.19 percent of the total number of farm households. These agricultural production cooperatives are distributed in 1,436 townships and 4,614 villages, accounting for 80.1 percent of the total number of townships and 68.2 percent of the total number of villages. The operating results of these agricultural cooperatives demonstrate their enormous superiority.

    From where can we see the superiority of agricultural cooperatives? According to statistics from Jiaozhou Prefecture, more than 90 percent of them have increased production, which is the most obvious manifestation of their superiority. Members and non-members alike acknowledge that they are "in the right direction, have great strength, and produce well." The new folk song mentioned earlier was produced and circulated under these circumstances.

    Because cooperation can increase production, the broad masses of farmers are eagerly demanding to join agricultural cooperatives. This is a widespread phenomenon that is very worthy of attention.

    I visited the agricultural production cooperative in Heping Village, Seventh District of Jiaoxian County, and saw the record of their rapid increase in production. This cooperative has 130 members, with 2,001.36 mu of land as shares. Before the establishment of the agricultural cooperative, the average annual yield per mu was 226 jin; after the establishment of the agricultural cooperative, the average yield per mu increased to 348 jin in 1953 and 440.5 jin in 1954. The output has almost doubled in the two years since the establishment of the cooperative, which is indeed remarkable. The nearby mutual aid teams and individual farmers all praised and envied the high yield of the agricultural cooperative. The Wu Wenchang mutual aid team in Shilibu Village, one of the best mutual aid teams, had an average annual yield per mu of 62 jin less than the Heping Village agricultural cooperative; the six individual farmers in Zhujiazhuang, who were very skilled in farming techniques, had an average annual yield per mu of 94 jin less than the Heping Village agricultural cooperative. At first, they did not admit it, but now they cannot but admit that they cannot compare with the agricultural cooperative.

    Since the land in the cooperative produces more grain, the income of the members is naturally constantly increasing. The increase in income of the members of the Heping Village agricultural cooperative can be illustrated by a few examples in the following table:

    If calculated according to the average labor income of each member of the cooperative, then the annual income per labor force was 1,063 jin in 1953 and increased to 1,331 jin in 1954. Because the production of the whole cooperative has increased and the income of the members has increased, they are very active in paying public grain or selling surplus grain. In 1954, the agricultural cooperative paid 8,500 jin of wheat and 18,574 jin of autumn grain as public grain; sold 34,000 jin of wheat and 40,000 jin of autumn grain as surplus grain, and sold 15,000 jin of cotton. The 21 members who were relatively poor in the past can now eat pancakes at every meal, and those who had a better life in the past are now even better. According to a survey of the family life of 54 farmers, they now have daily necessities that they did not have in the past. These 54 households have 19 thermos bottles, 39 flashlights, 42 pairs of rubber shoes, 38 sets of men's uniforms, 40 sets of women's uniforms, 10 coats, and 5 felt hats. Their lives are much better than those of non-members.

    The comparison of facts is more convincing than any eloquence. He Fu'an, a middle peasant in Lujiazhaixiang, Tenth District of Jiaoxian County, was unwilling to join the agricultural cooperative when the village organized the agricultural cooperative in 1953, and decided to compete with the agricultural cooperative. Last year, he encountered autumn floods, and the average yield of his grain was only 175 jin per mu; the agricultural cooperative planted flood-resistant crops, and the yield per mu was 210 jin. When the agricultural cooperative was threshing, He Fu'an squatted by the threshing ground and watched. Finally, he said: "I was wrong, I will join the agricultural cooperative no matter what next year." He did join the cooperative this spring. Jiang Sifu, a farmer in Xiaowanggezhuang, said: "The agricultural cooperative produces more grain and lives a good life; Chairman Mao's idea is great, you can't go wrong if you follow it with your eyes closed." This can represent the common thoughts of all farmers who believe in the superiority of agricultural cooperatives. We should develop and consolidate this idea to promote the continued development and consolidation of agricultural cooperatives.

    There is an argument that "agricultural cooperatives are developing too fast and cannot be led; the unstable cooperatives should be allowed to return to mutual aid teams." This is obviously incorrect. The broad masses of laboring farmers are opposed to this negative argument, and they demand that they be given positive leadership so that they can run agricultural cooperatives better and better.

    I also investigated the situation of the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wenhua Township, Seventh District of Jiaoxian County, which can prove that the farmers' demands are very strong. This agricultural cooperative has 20 members and 330 mu of land, and was established only this spring. The establishment of this cooperative was lacking in preparation. It was merged from two mutual aid teams led by non-Communists: one was the mutual aid team led by the poor peasant Wang Chengqiang, and the other was the mutual aid team led by the middle peasant Wang Chengliang. The two leaders discussed the establishment of the cooperative themselves, and then separately solicited the opinions of the members, and announced the establishment of the cooperative without even holding an establishment meeting. There was no organization, no system in the cooperative, and it was actually a joint venture of two mutual aid teams. All the work was done by each group sending an equal number of people. However, the labor force and production tools of the two groups were not balanced, so they often had disagreements, which led to internal disunity. Under the instigation of Wang Chengliang, five middle peasants recently proposed to withdraw from the cooperative. However, all the poor peasant members united around Wang Chengqiang, insisted on running the cooperative, and asked the district to send people to help them. One new middle peasant who had already announced his withdrawal from the cooperative asked to return to the cooperative. There is no doubt that this agricultural cooperative still has hope of being run well. Because the vast majority of the members of this agricultural cooperative have seen the results of cooperative production in the process of production cooperation this spring, which is much better than the results of the original mutual aid team; and they are all sincerely willing to run the cooperative. Although they have no experience, are not well organized, have not established articles of association and systems, and there have been phenomena of disunity, they know that these are all completely surmountable. If anyone wants them to break up and return to the mutual aid team, it will definitely not work. Wang Chengqiang said it right: "We old poor peasants and new middle peasants must cooperate. To say that we should return to the mutual aid team and do our own thing, haven't we done that before? What are the benefits?! Who can forbid us from running a cooperative?!"

    The truth is very clear, since agricultural production cooperatives can bring such rapid, direct, and significant benefits to farmers' production and life, farmers will definitely be willing to run cooperatives; after they have completely voluntarily established agricultural cooperatives, everyone should help them run them well. If they encounter difficulties, they must actively help them to overcome the difficulties so that the cooperative can continue to run; and they should not be allowed to return to the mutual aid team, which actually dissolves the agricultural cooperative that has already been established. These are two different attitudes in the current leadership of the agricultural collectivization movement. The former is the correct attitude of actively and steadily leading the masses forward; the latter is the wrong attitude of passively retreating and abandoning leadership responsibility. We should adopt and support the former attitude, and abandon and oppose the latter attitude.

    Some comrades believe that letting those agricultural cooperatives with more difficulties return to the mutual aid team, slowing down the development speed of agricultural cooperatives, and reducing the number of existing agricultural cooperatives can prevent rash advances and maintain stability. This is obviously a one-sided view. In fact, the problem now is not "rash advance," but that the leadership of rural work cannot keep up with the demands of the masses of farmers for the agricultural collectivization movement. The example of the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative mentioned earlier can also prove this point. Who initiated and organized this agricultural cooperative? It was the masses of farmers themselves who were wholeheartedly yearning for socialism. This cooperative has only one Communist Party member, who does not hold a leadership position in the cooperative; of course, no one would think that this agricultural cooperative was organized by the Communist Party. Wang Chengqiang, the poor peasant, is a member of the Communist Youth League, and Wang Chengliang, the middle peasant, is neither a party member nor a league member. Their lack of articles of association and systems also reflects their lack of party leadership. However, they spontaneously and voluntarily established an agricultural cooperative, and the members of the two mutual aid teams they originally led were indeed very willing to run an agricultural cooperative. So, if we want to say "rash advance," who should be blamed for "rash advance"? Can we blame the members of the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative for "rash advance"?

    In fact, examples of spontaneous and voluntary establishment of cooperatives like the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative are still constantly emerging. Many agricultural mutual aid teams are demanding to develop into agricultural cooperatives, which is an inevitable trend, and we cannot turn a blind eye to it, and we must actively strengthen our leadership over them. On the contrary, in order to prevent and eliminate the blind spontaneous phenomena in the agricultural collectivization movement, we must comprehensively strengthen the leadership of the agricultural cooperatives that have been established and the mutual aid teams that are preparing to establish agricultural cooperatives, according to the actual needs of the movement, so that more agricultural cooperatives can be better established on the basis of mutual aid teams with full preparation.

    It should be admitted that some of the problems in the consolidation and development of agricultural cooperatives are due to the neglect of the leadership of mutual aid teams; and the vast number of mutual aid teams are very urgently demanding leadership. According to the statistical materials of Jiaozhou Prefecture in the spring of this year, there are still 34,467 permanent mutual aid teams and 44,199 seasonal mutual aid teams in this prefecture, and the farmers organized into mutual aid teams account for 59.7 percent of the total number of farm households. However, the leadership of these large numbers of mutual aid teams is very poor, and in a sense, it can be said that they are without leadership. The staff of the county and district also admit that they have been unable to take care of the agricultural mutual aid teams more and more in the past year or so; if there is an agricultural cooperative in the village, they can still give some help to the mutual aid teams in the village, otherwise there is simply no way.

    But, is there really no way? Of course not. For example, designate special staff members in the division of labor of district-level staff to be responsible for leading mutual aid and cooperation; and each district convenes all the leaders of mutual aid teams to hold meetings to arrange and check work before and after the start and end of each agricultural labor season, in order to overcome the current state of many mutual aid teams falling into laissez-faire, so that the activities of mutual aid teams in each agricultural season can receive the necessary political and technical leadership. These can be done and should be done completely. In addition, we can think of other ways to strengthen leadership.

    Strengthening the leadership of mutual aid teams will greatly help the further development and consolidation of agricultural cooperatives. Only after the training and preparation of mutual aid teams can the establishment of agricultural cooperatives have a reliable foundation; and only agricultural cooperatives established on such a foundation will be consolidated. Therefore, in the entire agricultural collectivization movement, we must consider the problem of agricultural mutual aid teams together with the problem of agricultural cooperatives, and we should not divide and oppose them, so that we lose sight of one thing and lose sight of the overall situation.

    In order to promote the agricultural collectivization movement and make it develop steadily, there are many things we should do, and three of them are currently in urgent need of solution.

    In agricultural cooperatives, it is necessary to eliminate the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements, which is the first important thing. The Heping Village agricultural cooperative mentioned earlier suffered serious losses due to the sabotage of bad elements. In the spring of 1954, Guan Fengqi, a bad element who had once served as a puppet village chief, infiltrated the agricultural cooperative, served as an accountant, and tried his best to undermine the leadership of the cooperative. He scolded Guan Xiangyun, the director of the cooperative, as a "bedbug," and claimed to dismiss Guan Xiangyun and appoint himself as the director, causing unrest in the whole cooperative. Later, when this bad element was expelled, the situation of the agricultural cooperative immediately improved. However, the agricultural cooperative is still threatened by the conspiracy and sabotage of hidden counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements. During the spring plowing this year, it was discovered that someone had stolen two shovel heads and one plow, buried them in the ground; then four plows were lost, all of which were obviously done by bad elements. There are also bad elements who plan to put up the signboard of agricultural cooperatives to deceive legal status in order to do evil, which must be exposed by the masses and banned according to law. The comrades in Jiaozhou Prefecture said that according to the materials of five counties, more than 1,000 landlords, rich peasants, and other bad elements have been found to have infiltrated agricultural cooperatives, and they have adopted many conspiratorial sabotage methods to undermine the cooperatives. This fully proves that the development of the agricultural collectivization movement is a fierce class struggle. Therefore, we must deeply mobilize the masses, expose all counter-revolutionaries and bad elements from all corners, and completely block all the gaps for them to carry out sabotage activities.

    A general policy inspection should be carried out in all agricultural cooperatives, with particular emphasis on checking the relationship between middle peasants and poor peasants within the cooperatives and the implementation of the voluntary and mutually beneficial policy, in order to further strengthen and consolidate the internal unity of agricultural cooperatives, which is another very important task. The situation of the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative mentioned earlier is essentially the relationship between middle peasants and poor peasants, that is, the issue of voluntary and mutual benefit. The mutual aid team led by the middle peasant Wang Chengliang voluntarily merged with the mutual aid team led by the poor peasant Wang Chengqiang to build an agricultural cooperative, but because there was no correct system and there were disputes over the calculation of labor force and other issues, they could not maintain their mutual benefit, so everyone originally wanted to run an agricultural cooperative, but now some of them are unwilling to stay in the agricultural cooperative. This shows that mutual benefit must be guaranteed to guarantee voluntariness; the realization of the principle of voluntary mutual benefit must be guaranteed to guarantee the normal relationship between middle peasants and poor peasants. At present, in the process of further consolidating and developing agricultural cooperatives, all localities should conduct a general inspection on the relationship between middle and poor peasants and the policy of voluntary and mutual benefit, and seriously rectify those agricultural cooperatives with more problems, so that they can all develop and consolidate smoothly.

    The main staff of agricultural cooperatives require universal training to improve their political and business levels, which is also a very important thing at present. In the future process of continuous development and consolidation of agricultural cooperatives, it is very necessary to train a large number of directors, accountants, and other personnel of agricultural cooperatives. People will see the importance of this matter, and the problem is that the solution should still be studied. The policy should be to universally run fixed, short-term training courses so that all directors, deputy directors, and accountants of agricultural cooperatives have the opportunity to be trained in rotation to meet the needs of the ever-developing agricultural collectivization movement.

    The leadership of agricultural cooperatives should be strengthened in all aspects, especially from the work of the party's grassroots organizations in the countryside. Let those agricultural cooperatives that develop in a laissez-faire manner no longer be in a laissez-faire state! Let agricultural production cooperatives across the country be run more and better!

    让农业合作社办得更多更好
　　邓曼公
　　“社会主义是天堂，
　　合作社是天梯。
　　方向要走对，
　　人多心要齐；
　　步步往上升，
　　力量大无比。”
    这是在山东胶州一带农民群众中流传的新歌谣。这是农民们根据亲身体验所发现的真理。从这个歌谣里，我们可以看到，广大农民是多么清楚地懂得农业生产合作社的好处。他们成批地走上合作化的道路，并且已经得到了重大的实际利益。这是他们在全国解放和实行土地改革以后的又一次大翻身。
    农民们对于农业合作化的方向抱着无限信心是有充分根据的。以胶州专区为例，据今年春季的统计，这个专区已有农业生产合作社八八一二个，有一九二、五五二个农户入社，占总农户的百分之二二·一九。这些农业生产合作社分布在一、四三六个乡，四、六一四个村，占总乡数的百分之八○·一，总村数的百分之六八·二。这些农业合作社经营的成绩表现了它们的巨大优越性。
    从什么地方可以看到农业合作社的优越性呢？据胶州专区的统计，它们有百分之九十以上是增产的，这就是它们的优越性的最鲜明的一个表现。社员和非社员都公认它们是“方向对，力量大，生产好”。前面所举的新歌谣就在这种情况下产生和流传起来。
    因为合作起来能够增加生产，这就使广大农民都迫切要求参加农业合作社。这是非常值得重视的普遍现象。
    我访问胶县七区和平庄的农业生产合作社，看到他们的生产迅速提高的记录。这个社共有社员一三○户，入股土地二、○○一·三六亩。在这里，未建立农业合作社以前，每亩地的平均年产量是二二六斤；建立了农业合作社以后，一九五三年每亩地的平均产量增加到三四八斤，一九五四年每亩地的平均产量增加到四四○·五斤。建社以后两年间增加了约一倍的产量，这的确是了不起。附近的互助组和单干农民都称赞和羡慕农业合作社的高额产量。当地十里铺村武文昌互助组是最好的互助组之
  一，平均每亩年产量就比和平庄农业合作社的少六十二斤；当地朱家庄有六户单干农民是耕作技术很高的，他们平均每亩年产量却比和平庄农业合作社的更少九十四斤。起先他们不承认，现在他们不能不承认比不过农业合作社了。
    入社的土地都多打粮食，当然社员的收入也就不断增多。和平庄农业合作社的社员收入增加的情形可以举几个例子列表如下：
    如果按照全社每个社员平均劳动力的收入来计算，那么，每一劳动力的全年收入一九五三年为一○六三斤，一九五四年就增至一三三一斤。因为全社生产提高，社员收入增多，他们无论交公粮或者卖余粮都很积极。一九五四年这个农业合作社交公粮小麦八、五○○斤，秋粮一八、五七四斤；卖余粮小麦三四、○○○斤，秋粮四○、○○○斤，卖棉花一五、○○○斤。过去比较贫困的二十一户社员现在每顿也都能吃饼子，过去生活比较好的现在更好了。据五十四户的农民家庭生活调查，他们过去没有的日用品现在也有了，这五十四户就有暖水瓶十九把，手电筒三十九个，回力球鞋四十二双，男制服三十八套，女制服四十套，大衣十件，呢帽五顶。他们的生活比非社员好得多了。
    事实的比较比任何雄辩更令人信服。胶县十区鲁家寨乡有一个中农名叫何福安，在一九五三年村里组织农业合作社的时候，他不肯加入，决心跟农业合作社比赛。去年遇到秋涝，他打的粮食每亩平均只有一七五斤；农业合作社种了抗涝庄稼，每亩收成二一○斤。农业合作社打场的时候，何福安蹲在场边看。最后他说：“我错了，明年不管说什么我也要参加农业合作社。”今年春天他果然入社了。当地小王戈庄的农民姜思福说：“农业合作社十九多打粮，生活过得好；毛主席的主意高，您闭起眼睛跟着走也保你错不了。”这可以代表所有信服农业合作社的优越性的农民们的共同思想。我们应该发展和巩固这种思想，以促进农业合作社的继续发展和巩固。
    有一种论调说：“农业合作社发展太快，领导不了；应该让不巩固的社退回互助组去。”这显然是不正确的。广大的劳动农民群众是反对这种消极论调的，他们要求给他们以积极的领导，使他们把农业合作社都办得好些再好些。
    我在胶县七区文化乡还调查了红星农业生产合作社的情形，它就可以证明农民群众的这种要求是很强烈的。这个农业合作社有二十户社员，三三○亩土地，今年春天才成立。这个社的成立是缺乏准备的。它由两个非共产党员领导的互助组合并起来：一个是贫农王成强领导的互助组，另一个是中农王成良领导的互助组。这两位组长自己商议要建社，就分头征求组员的意见，连成立会也没有开就宣布建社了。社内没有组织，没有制度，实际上是两个互助组的联合，有什么活都由两个组各派同等的人力去做。但是两个组本来的劳动力和生产工具就不平衡，因此经常闹意见，以致发生了内部不团结的现象。有五户中农在王成良怂恿之下，最近提出退社。但是所有的贫农社员团结在王成强的周围，都坚持要办社，并且要求区里派人帮助他们。已经宣布退社的有一户新中农又要求回到社里来。这个农业合作社还有希望办好是没有疑问的。因为这个农业合作社的最大多数成员在今年春天的生产合作的过程中已经看到了合作生产的成绩很不错，比原来互助组的成绩强；他们又都是真心要办社的，虽然没有经验，没有组织得好，没有订出章程和制度，发生了不团结现象，但是他们知道这些完全是可以克服的。谁要他们散伙，退回到互助组去，那是一定行不通的。王成强说得对：“俺们老贫农和新中农说什么也要合作。要说退回互助组去，各干各的，那不是早干过了么？有什么好处呀！谁能不许俺们办社呀？！”
    道理非常明白，既然农业生产合作社给农民的生产和生活能够这样迅速地带来直接的显著的利益，农民们就一定愿意办社；当他们完全自愿地建立了农业合作社以后，谁也应该帮助他们办好。如果他们遇到了困难，必须积极帮助他们去克服困难，以便把社继续办下去；而不应该让他们退回到互助组去，实际上使已经建立的农业合作社又散伙了。这是目前领导农业合作化运动中的两种不同的态度。前一种是积极稳步地领导群众前进的正确态度；后一种是消极退缩地放弃领导责任的错误态度。我们应该采取和支持前一种态度，而抛弃和反对后一种态度。
    有的同志以为让那些困难较多的农业合作社退回到互助组去，把农业合作社发展的速度放慢，并使现有农业合作社的数目缩减一些，这样才可以防止冒进，才可以保持稳步。这显然是片面的观点。事实上现在的问题并不是什么“冒进”，而是农村工作的领导跟不上农民群众对于农业合作化运动的要求。前面所举的红星农业生产合作社的例子也可以证明这一点。是谁发动组织这个农业合作社呢？是一心向往社会主义的农民群众自己。这个社只有一个共产党员，在社里也不是担任领导职务的；当然不会有人认为这个农业合作社是共产党一定要他们组织的。那个贫农王成强是青年团员，那个中农王成良既非党员也非团员。他们没有办社的章程和制度，也恰恰反映了他们缺乏党的领导的状况。但是，他们却自发地自愿地办起农业合作社来了，他们原来领导的两个互助组的组员们的确也都是非常愿意办农业合作社的。那么，如果要说“冒进”的话，这应该怪谁“冒进”呢？难道能够责备红星农业合作社的社员们“冒进”吗？
    事实上，现在像红星农业合作社这样自发地自愿地建社的例子还不断出现。有许多农业互助组正在要求发展成为农业合作社，这是一种必然的趋势，不容许我们熟视无睹，不容许我们不积极加强对它们的领导。相反的，为了预防和消除农业合作化运动中的盲目自发的现象，我们必须根据实际运动发展的需要，对于已经建成的农业合作社和准备建立农业合作社的互助组，全面地加强领导，使更多的农业合作社能够更好地在互助组的基础上有充分准备地建立起来。
    应该承认，目前在农业合作社的巩固和发展当中，有若干问题是由于对互助组领导的忽视而来的；而广大的互助组是非常迫切地要求领导的。据胶州专区今年春天的统计材料来看，这个专区还有常年互助组三四、四六七个，季节性互助组四四、一九九个，组织到互助组中的农民占总农户的百分之五九点七。但是，对于这大量的互助组的领导状况却是很不好的，在某种意义上也可以说它们是没有领导的。县区的工作人员也承认，近一年多以来对农业互助组越加照顾不上了；如果村子里有农业合作社，他们还可以给予本村的互助组以某些帮助，否则简直就没有办法。
    但是，果真没有办法吗？当然不是。比如，在区级工作人员的分工上指定专门的工作人员负责领导互助合作；并且各区在每个农业劳动季节开始以前和结束以后，都召集所有的互助组组长开会布置和检查工作，以克服目前许多互助组陷入自流的状态，使互助组在各个农业季节中的活动能够得到政治上和技术上的必要的领导。这些就完全可以做也应该做。此外还可以想出其他加强领导的办法。
    加强对互助组的领导将大大有助于农业合作社进一步的发展和巩固。只有经过互助组的锻炼和准备，农业合作社的建立才有可靠的基础；同时也只有在这样的基础上建立起来的农业合作社才会是巩固的。因此，在整个农业合作化运动中，我们必须把农业互助组的问题同农业合作社的问题摆在一起来考虑，而不应该把它们分割和对立起来，以致顾此失彼，影响全局。
    为了推进农业合作化运动，使它稳步地向前发展，我们应该做的事情还很多，其中有三个问题也是目前亟待解决的。
    在农业合作社里，必须肃清反革命分子和其他坏分子的破坏活动，这是头一件要紧的事情。前面所举的和平庄农业合作社就曾因为坏分子的破坏而受到严重损失。一九五四年的春天，有一个曾经当过伪保长的坏分子管凤歧混进了这个农业合作社，充任会计，极力破坏社的领导。他骂社长管相云为“臭虫”，并声言要罢免管相云，自任社长，闹得全社不安。后来把这个坏分子开除出去，农业合作社的情况马上好转。但是，现在这个农业合作社仍然受到暗藏的反革命分子和其他坏分子阴谋破坏和威胁。今年春耕的时候，发现有人偷走了两个铲头，一个犁子，埋在土里；接着又有四个犁子丢了，这些显然都是坏分子干的。还有的坏分子有计划地打起农业合作社的招牌，骗取合法地位，以便为非作歹，这就必须依靠群众加以揭发并依法加以取缔。胶州专区的同志说，据五个县的材料，目前已经查明混入农业合作社的地主、富农等各种坏分子约有一千多名，他们采取了许多阴谋破坏的方式，要把合作社搞垮。这充分证明农业合作化运动的发展乃是一场激烈的阶级斗争。因此，我们必须深入地发动群众，从各个角落里把一切反革命分子和坏分子揭发出来，完全堵塞它们进行破坏活动的一切空隙。
    应该普遍地向所有的农业合作社进行政策的检查，特别着重检查合作社内部中农和贫农的关系及自愿互利政策的执行情况，以便借此进一步地加强和巩固农业合作社内部的团结，这是又一件十分要紧的工作。像前面所举的红星农业合作社的那种情况，实质上就是中农和贫农的关系问题，也就是自愿互利的政策问题。那个中农王成良领导的互助组本来是自愿地和贫农王成强领导的互助组合并建成农业合作社的，但是因为没有正确的制度，彼此对劳动力的计算等问题有争执，以致不能保持彼此的互利，于是他们大家原来都愿意办农业合作社，现在却有一部分不愿意留在农业合作社里。这就可见必须保证互利，才能保证自愿；必须保证自愿互利原则的实现，才能保证中农和贫农之间的正常关系。目前在进一步巩固和发展农业合作社的过程中，各地应该就中贫农的关系和自愿互利的政策问题进行普遍的检查，认真地整顿那些问题较多的农业合作社，使它们都能够顺利地发展和巩固起来。
    农业合作社的主要工作人员要求普遍受到训练，以提高他们的政治水平和业务水平，这也是目前很要紧的一件事情。在今后农业合作社继续发展和巩固的过程中，大量训练农业合作社的主任、会计等人员是非常必要的。人们都会看到这件事情的重要，问题是解决的办法还应该研究。方针应该是普遍举办固定的、短期的训练班，使所有的农业合作社主任、副主任和会计人员等都有机会轮流受到训练，以适应农业合作化运动日益发展的需要。
    对于农业合作社的领导要从各方面来加强，特别是要从党在农村的基层组织的工作中来加强。让那些自流发展的农业合作社不再处于自流的状态吧！让全国各地农业生产合作社办得更多更好吧！
