　　Thinking back to more than forty years ago, I had the honor of being a close friend of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the great pioneer of your country. I still deeply cherish those past events. This year marks the 30th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death, and I would like to offer a bouquet of flowers at the tomb of the respected Mr. Sun Yat-sen.

　　This spring, I also had a cordial meeting with Mr. Lei Renmin and others from your country's trade delegation to Japan. I am very happy at the thought of meeting them again here in Beijing.

　　I would like to take this opportunity to have close conversations with leading figures from all walks of life in your country, as well as with the broad masses of the people of your country. I believe that through such exchanges, even if diplomatic relations between China and Japan have not yet been formally established, a path can be opened up between the people of the two countries, and a sincere connection can be established between the people.

　　We are delighted to receive the warm hospitality of our friends in your country and to have the opportunity to visit your country's great development undertakings. Furthermore, please allow us to talk more about our views. We are willing to state a fact: the peaceful coexistence of neighboring countries is essential to maintaining world peace.

    久原文子恢复日中、日苏邦交国民会议会长秘书
    新华社二十一日讯　日本“恢复日中、日苏邦交国民会议访华团团长久原房之助抵达北京机场时发表谈话如下：
    此次我们六人，以久原房之助为团长，承贵国人民外交学会会长张奚若先生的邀请，能够到贵国访问，觉得非常高兴。
    我们为了促使日本和中国、苏联邦交正常化，正站在此种国民运动的前列。
    我（久原房之助）现任日本“恢复日中、日苏邦交国民会议”会长，因为今年已是八十六岁的老年人，也许我的言行将有些冒昧，先请诸位原谅。
    想起来是四十几年前的事了，当时承贵国伟大的先觉者孙中山先生和我做了亲密的朋友，我到现在还深深追怀着这宗往事，今年适逢孙中山先生逝世三十周年，我很想到我所憬念的先生的墓前，献上一束鲜花。
    今年春天，我又和贵国访日贸易代表团雷任民先生等位亲切地见了面，这一次来到北京，可以和他们再一次见面了，想到这里，觉得很高兴。
    借此机会，我更加希望和贵国各阶层的领导人士以及贵国广大的人民亲密地交谈，我相信：通过这种交谈，中日间的外交关系即便还没有在形式上建立起来，却可以在两国人民之间打开道路，人民彼此间能够树立真诚的联系。
    此次得到贵国朋友们的亲切招待，又有机会参观贵国伟大的发展事业，令人欣喜。此外，请诸位也允许我们多多地谈谈我们的看法。我们愿意说明一个事实：邻近国家的和平相处就是维护世界和平。
