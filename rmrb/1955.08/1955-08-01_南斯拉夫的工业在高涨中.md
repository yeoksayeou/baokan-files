    Yugoslavia's Industry is on the Rise
    Soviet Union　Dnieprov

    The legacy that the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia inherited from the past was heavy. The old Kingdom of Yugoslavia was a backward agricultural country with a very weak industry, completely controlled by foreign capital. French, British, and American monopolists greedily plundered Yugoslavia's natural resources, investing mainly in mining industries that could generate the greatest profits. During World War II, the fascist occupiers continued to plunder Yugoslavia and destroyed many enterprises when they fled the country.

    After liberation, the Yugoslav working people set about building their own industry – the foundation of national independence. Large and medium-sized industrial enterprises and transportation became public property. Banks, wholesale trade, and most of the retail trade were transferred to the state. The property of foreign monopoly capital was also nationalized.

    As early as 1947, the state-owned sector already accounted for a large proportion of industrial enterprises. From this year on, Yugoslavia began to implement its first five-year economic plan, the basic task of which was to overcome the country's economic and technological backwardness. Due to certain reasons, the tasks of the five-year plan were not fully completed, but the gains were significant.

    The Yugoslav working people resolutely implemented the policy of national industrialization. According to materials from the "Economic Policy" magazine, in recent years, more than 60 percent of total investment has been used for industry, primarily heavy industry. From 1947 to 1954, investment in basic construction averaged more than 257 billion dinars (Yugoslav currency) per year. This has already had an effect. Many new enterprises have been built in Yugoslavia. Special attention has been paid to the construction of metallurgical plants, machine-building factories, chemical plants, and hydroelectric power stations.

    The speed of development of Yugoslavia's heavy industry can be illustrated by materials published in the Belgrade statistical monthly "Index": Pig iron production in 1954 was three and a half times the 1939 level, steel—2.6 times, steel products—2.7 times, and coal—about twice. The production of non-ferrous metals (except copper) has also increased significantly. Compared with the pre-war period, industrial output in 1954 increased by more than double.

    According to the same magazine, the general index of industrial production in Yugoslavia for the first five months of this year increased by 23 percent compared with the same period last year. In particular, the production of ferrous metals increased by 45 percent, the chemical industry—43 percent, the textile industry—26 percent, and the food industry—27 percent.

    Certain achievements have also been made in national electrification. Before the war, the enormous water resources were hardly utilized. Now the situation has changed. By the end of last year, more than fifty power stations with different generating capacities had been put into production. As a result, electricity production has increased two-fold compared with the pre-war period. In the first five months of this year, electricity production increased by 30 percent compared with the same period last year.

    Many new enterprises are under construction. The "Zvornik" hydroelectric power station alone will generate more electricity in the future than all the power stations in Serbia before the war. The "Vinodol" hydroelectric power station is being built in the mountains of Croatia, and the "Jablanica" hydroelectric power station is being built in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is the largest hydroelectric power station in Yugoslavia, and it will be able to generate 720 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. But even with such an increase in electricity production, it still cannot keep up with the growing needs of Yugoslav industry and residents. Yugoslav newspapers point out that electricity shortages will continue to be felt for some time to come.

    Yugoslavia's achievements in developing light industry are also significant. The production of cotton and woolen fabrics, leather and rubber shoes, paper, tobacco, and other consumer goods has expanded. If some light industry sectors lagged behind in 1953, then in 1954 and the first few months of this year, it can be seen that production in all light industry sectors has grown faster. Yugoslav economists believe that the 14 percent increase in industrial production compared with the 1954 plan will be achieved this year, and in some republics, this increase in industrial production will be even greater.

    Due to the development of industry, the structure of Yugoslavia's national income has also changed. Industry now accounts for 42.1 percent of national income, agriculture accounts for 30.3 percent, trade and public utilities account for 7.5 percent, construction accounts for 7.3 percent, handicrafts account for 4.8 percent, and transportation accounts for 4.6 percent. Thus, the proportion of industry in national income has exceeded that of agriculture. This means that Yugoslavia is transforming from an agricultural country into an industrial country.

    The Yugoslav working class is growing. In 1954, there were 685,000 industrial workers in the country, compared with only 300,000 in 1939. The contrast between urban and rural residents has also changed: the population living in the countryside is no longer 75 percent of the national population as before the war, but 60 percent.

    Zagreb, the capital of the People's Republic of Croatia (Note: The Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia consists of six constituent republics and two autonomous provinces. The six constituent republics are: Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, and Montenegro - translator's note), is a huge industrial center. In the last ten years, its population has increased by 100,000. Thirty new enterprises have been built here, and ninety-five enterprises have been completely renovated and expanded. About 50,000 workers work in these enterprises. Rijeka, a city in Croatia – a port on the Adriatic coast – has become the center of Yugoslavia's shipbuilding and oil processing industries. The "May 3rd" shipyard, which has been virtually rebuilt, is building ships with a displacement of 10,000 tons. This shipyard is producing orders not only for its own country but also for foreign countries – especially Switzerland. The total length of the docks in the port of Rijeka is 12 kilometers, and it has regular passenger and cargo transportation links with the ports of many countries.

    Ljubljana, the capital of the People's Republic of Slovenia, is developing rapidly. The working people of the city are proud of establishing the "Litostroj" heavy machinery manufacturing factory. Industry is also developing in other cities in Slovenia. In the years since the war, Slovenia's industrial output has more than doubled. In 1954, Slovenia's metallurgical plants produced nearly half of the country's steel output, and its textile enterprises produced half of the country's cotton fabrics. Powerful hydroelectric power stations have been built in the Republic of Slovenia.

    Industrial production in Bosnia-Herzegovina has increased nearly two-fold compared with the pre-war period, and the black metallurgical industry is developing there, where there are abundant iron and coal deposits. The combined factory being built in Zenica has already supplied metal materials to other new construction projects across the country. The designed production capacity of this combined factory is nearly 800,000 tons of pig iron per year.

    The "Borba" newspaper says that Bosnia-Herzegovina is now becoming the most industrially developed region in Yugoslavia.

    Before the war, the level of industrial development varied greatly across Yugoslavia. Slovenia had a relatively developed industry, while Macedonia and Montenegro were very backward. This backward phenomenon has now been eliminated. In 1954, the industrial production index for Macedonia was 351, while for Montenegro it was 443 (100 in 1939).

    However, it would be wrong to think that the industrialization of Yugoslavia has been easy. There are difficulties, and quite a few. For example, it is still necessary to consolidate Yugoslavia's finances. The work of some industrial sectors depends on imported raw materials. Yugoslavia has to import cotton, rubber, coking coal, high-quality coal, oil, manganese ore, and so on. In addition, it is necessary to import large quantities of machinery, electrical equipment, transportation equipment, and various spare parts.

    In order to pay for imports, Yugoslavia is working hard to expand its exports. Its main exports are grain, timber, and non-ferrous metals.

    Improving relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies has opened up favorable prospects for Yugoslavia, especially its industry. Even Western countries cannot fail to recognize this, although some groups there do not like the development of the Yugoslav economy and its economic ties with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies at all.

    The French "La Croix" wrote: "Yugoslavia's development of trade with Eastern countries will help it eliminate the deficit in its payment account without reducing trade with Western countries... Expanding purchases of oil, petroleum products, cotton, and manganese ore abundant in the Soviet Union and some People's Democracies will greatly reduce Yugoslavia's expenditure on the dollar area..."

    Yugoslavia's trade with Eastern European countries is expanding greatly. In the first quarter of 1955, Yugoslavia signed trade agreements with the Soviet Union, Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, totaling $87 million. In May, it also signed a trade and payment agreement with Albania. For example, the trade agreement between Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia stipulates that the total volume of exchange of goods between the two sides should be tripled compared with the previously concluded agreement. In addition, as the Czechoslovak "Rude Pravo" pointed out, Czechoslovakia will be able to use the Yugoslav port of Rijeka to transport its goods to the Middle East, Near East and Albania. This will expand the throughput of the port of Rijeka, which is what Yugoslavia is concerned about.

    Trade between the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies and Yugoslavia is conducted on the basis of complete equality and mutual benefit. They mutually supply goods necessary for the development of their respective national economies. For example, Romania will export oil products, oxygen, mineral oil, paper, various machines, oil equipment, and other commodities of prime importance to Yugoslavia. On the other hand, Yugoslavia will supply Romania with steel and steel pipes, chromium ore, caustic soda, carbide, cellulose, various machines, and other commodities.

    Yugoslav public opinion welcomes the expansion of economic ties with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. The Yugoslav "Oslobodjenje" wrote in commenting on the joint Soviet-Yugoslav declaration: "It is well known that the consolidation and development of economic relations first is a necessary material basis. This basis can guarantee the further normalization of international relations and the development of friendly cooperation."

    Undoubtedly, friendly cooperation will have a favorable impact on the Yugoslav economy, enabling its industrial development to achieve new successes.

    南斯拉夫的工业在高涨中
    苏联　德聂伯罗夫
    南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国从过去接受下来的遗产是沉重的。旧南斯拉夫王国是一个落后的农业国家，工业十分薄弱，而且完全处于外国资本的控制之下。法国、英国和美国的垄断资本家贪婪地掠夺南斯拉夫的自然富源，主要是在能够获取最大利润的采矿工业部门投资。在第二次世界大战期间，法西斯占领者对南斯拉夫继续进行掠夺，并在从这个国家溃逃时破坏了许多企业。
    解放以后，南斯拉夫劳动人民着手建立自己的工业——民族独立的基础。大型和中型的工业企业以及运输业成为全民所有。银行、批发贸易和绝大部分零售贸易都转到了国家手里。外国垄断资本的财产也收归国有了。
    还在一九四七年时，在工业企业中，国营部分就已占了很大的比例。从这一年起，南斯拉夫开始实行第一个五年经济计划，这个计划的基本任务是克服国家的经济和技术落后的现象。由于某些原因，五年计划的任务并没有全部完成，但收获是不小的。
    南斯拉夫劳动人民坚决地执行着国家工业化的方针。根据“经济政策”杂志的材料，最近几年来，投资总额的百分之六十以上是用于工业，首先是重工业。从一九四七年到一九五四年，用于基本建设的投资平均每年在二千五百七十亿第纳尔（南币）以上。这已经产生了效果。在南斯拉夫，建成了许多新的企业。对于冶金工厂、机器制造厂、化学工厂和水电站的建设特别重视。
    关于南斯拉夫重工业发展的速度，可以从贝尔格莱德的统计月刊“指数”所发表的材料中得到说明：一九五四年生产的生铁等于一九三九年水平的三倍半，钢—二点六倍，钢材—二点七倍，煤—约二倍。有色金属（铜除外）的生产也有了显著的增加。和战前相比，一九五四年的工业产量增加了一倍以上。
    根据同一个杂志的材料，南斯拉夫今年头五个月的工业生产总指数比去年同期增加了百分之二十三。特别是黑色金属的生产量增加了百分之四十五，化学工业—百分之四十三，纺织工业—百分之二十六，食品工业—百分之二十七。
    在国家电气化方面也获得了一定的成就。在战前，巨大的水力资源是利用得很少的。现在情形改变了。去年年底以前，具有不同发电能力的五十多个发电站投入了生产。由于这样，电力生产比战前增加了两倍。今年头五个月内，电力生产比去年同期增加了百分之三十。
    许多新的企业正在建设中。仅仅一个“兹沃尔尼克”水电站将来就要发出比战前塞尔维亚全部发电站还多得多的电力。在克罗地亚山间正在建筑“维诺多尔”水电站，在波斯尼亚—黑塞哥维那正在建筑“雅布兰尼查”水电站。这是南斯拉夫全国最大的水电站，它每年将可以发出七亿二千万瓩时的电力。但即使电力生产如此增长，还是赶不上南斯拉夫工业和居民的需要的增长。南斯拉夫报纸指出，在今后的若干时期内，仍会感觉到电力的不足。
    南斯拉夫在发展轻工业方面的成就也是显著的。棉织品和毛织品、皮鞋和胶鞋、纸张、烟类和其他消费品的生产扩大了。如果在一九五三年一些轻工业的部门还表现落后的话，那末，在一九五四年和今年最初几个月内，可以看出轻工业所有部门的生产都有了更快的增长。南斯拉夫的经济学家们认为，今年工业生产比一九五四年计划增加百分之十四将会实现，而且在个别共和国中，这种工业生产的增加将更大一些。
    由于工业的发展，南斯拉夫的国民收入的结构也改变了。现在工业在国民收入中占百分之四十二点一，农业占百分之三十点三，贸易和公用事业占百分之七点五，建筑业占百分之七点三，手工业占百分之四点八，运输业占百分之四点六。这样，工业在国民收入中所占的比重已经超过了农业。这就是说，南斯拉夫正在从一个农业国转变成为一个工业国。
    南斯拉夫的工人阶级正在成长中。一九五四年全国共有产业工人六十八万五千人，而在一九三九年只有三十万人。城乡居民的对比也改变了：在乡村里居住的人口，已不是战前全国人口的百分之七十五，而是百分之六十了。
    克罗地亚人民共和国（按：南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国由六个加盟共和国和两个自治省组成。六个加盟共和国为：塞尔维亚、克罗地亚、斯洛文尼亚、波斯尼亚—黑塞哥维那、马其顿和门的内哥罗——译注）的首都——扎格雷布是一个巨大的工业中心。在最近十年中它的居民增加了十万人。这里已建成了三十个新的企业，完全改造和扩建了九十五个企业。在这些企业中工作的工人约有五万人。克罗地亚的一个城市——位在亚得里亚海畔的一个港口——利吉卡，已经变成了南斯拉夫的造船业和石油加工工业的中心。实际上等于是重新建设起来的“五月三日”造船厂，正在建造排水量达一万吨的船只。这个造船厂不仅在给本国，而且也给外国——特别是瑞士——生产定货。利吉卡港的码头总长度达十二公里，它同许多国家的港口都有经常的客货运输的联系。
    斯洛文尼亚人民共和国的首都卢布尔雅纳正在迅速发展着。该市的劳动人民以建立了重型机器制造工厂“里托斯特罗依”而自豪。在斯洛文尼亚的其他城市里，工业也在发展着。战后几年来，斯洛文尼亚的工业生产量已增加了一倍以上。一九五四年，斯洛文尼亚的冶金工厂生产的钢几达全国钢产量的一半，它的纺织企业生产了全国棉织品的一半。在斯洛文尼亚共和国已建成了强大的水电站。
    波斯尼亚—黑塞哥维那的工业生产比战前增加了近两倍，那里蕴藏着丰富的铁矿和煤矿，黑色冶金业在发展着。在热尼查建筑中的联合工厂，已经对全国其他新的建筑工程供应金属材料。这个联合工厂的设计生产能力为年产生铁近八十万吨。
  “战斗报”说，波斯尼亚—黑塞哥维那现在正在变成南斯拉夫工业最发达的地区。
    战前，南斯拉夫各地的工业发展水平差别很大。斯洛文尼亚有比较发达的工业，而马其顿与门的内哥罗则是十分落后的。现在这种落后现象已经消除了。在一九五四年，马其顿的工业生产指数为三百五十一，而门的内哥罗则为四百四十三（一九三九年为一百）。
    但是如果认为，南斯拉夫的工业化事业实行起来很容易，也是错误的。困难是有的，而且很不少。例如，还需要巩固南斯拉夫的财政。有一些工业部门的工作要仰赖进口原料。南斯拉夫不得不输入棉花、橡胶、焦煤、优质煤、石油、锰矿等等。除此之外，还要输入大量的机器、电气设备、运输工具和各种备件。
    为了支付进口，南斯拉夫正在努力扩大自己的出口。它的主要输出品是谷物、木材和有色金属。
    改善同苏联和人民民主国家的关系，给南斯拉夫，特别是它的工业，打开了有利的前景。这一点，甚至西方国家也是不能不承认的，虽然那里的某些集团一点都不喜欢南斯拉夫经济的发展和它同苏联和人民民主国家的经济联系。
    法国的“十字报”写道：“南斯拉夫发展同东方国家的贸易，是会帮助它在不缩减对西方国家贸易的情况下消除本国支付帐上的赤字的……。扩大对苏联和某些人民民主国家所富有的石油、石油产品、棉花和锰矿的采购，是会大大减轻南斯拉夫对美元地区的支出的……。”
    南斯拉夫同东欧国家的贸易正在大大地扩展。在一九五五年第一季内，南斯拉夫已同苏联、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、波兰、匈牙利和捷克斯洛伐克签订了贸易协定，总额为八千七百万美元。在五月里，它又同阿尔巴尼亚签订了贸易与支付协定。又如，捷克斯洛伐克同南斯拉夫的贸易协定，规定要把双方的换货总量比先前订立的协定增多三倍。此外，正如捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”所指出，捷克斯洛伐克将能使用南斯拉夫的利吉卡港以便把它的商品运到中、近东和阿尔巴尼亚去。这将扩大利吉卡港的吞吐量，而这正是南斯拉夫所关心的。
    苏联和人民民主国家同南斯拉夫的贸易，是在完全平等和互利的基础上进行的。它们互相供应为发展各自国家的国民经济所必需的货物。例如，罗马尼亚将对南斯拉夫输出石油产品，酸素，矿物油，纸张，各种机器，石油装备和其他有头等重要意义的商品。而南斯拉夫一方则供给罗马尼亚以钢材和钢管，铬矿石，苛性钠，炭化物，纤维素，各种机器和其他商品。
    南斯拉夫的公众舆论欢迎扩大同苏联和人民民主国家的经济联系。南斯拉夫的“解放报”在评论苏南两国联合声明时写道：“大家知道，首先使经济关系巩固和发展，是一个必要的物质基础。这种基础能够保证国际关系的进一步正常化和友好合作发展。”
    无疑的，友好合作将给南斯拉夫的经济以有利的影响，使它的工业发展获得新的成就。
