    The Huai River Commission Sends Personnel to Support Topographic Surveying for the Sanmenxia Project

    In order to ensure the rapid completion of the surveying work for the Sanmenxia Reservoir and Hydropower Station project, the Huai River Commission of the Ministry of Water Resources dispatched two surveying teams on July 10, comprising seventeen groups and more than 130 surveying technicians, to support the topographic surveying work of this project in Shan County, Henan Province.

    The topographic survey of the Sanmenxia project, including the submerged area and many other aspects, involves a vast and complex task. All measurements must be taken according to Soviet standards to achieve a high degree of accuracy. The entire topographic survey must be completed by the end of this year in order to provide reliable data for the design of the Sanmenxia project. After arriving at the Surveying Team of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission in Shan County, the surveying personnel supported by the Huai River Commission enthusiastically devoted themselves to studying Soviet surveying standards. After half a month of study, they will be assigned to carry out surveying work in the Weinan area of Shaanxi. (Xing Guang)

    治淮委员会派人支援三门峡工程地形测量
    为了保证三门峡水库和水电站工程测量工作迅速完成，水利部治淮委员会于七月十日派出两个测量队包括十七个小组、一百三十多名测量技术人员，赴河南省陕县支援这一工程的地形测量工作。
    三门峡工程的地形测量，包括淹没区等很多方面，任务浩大复杂，要一律采取苏联的规范测量，以达到高度的精确标准；整个地形测量要在今年年底完成，以便给三门峡工程设计提供可靠的资料。治淮委员会支援的测量人员到达陕县黄河水利委员会测量总队后，就热情地投入了关于苏联规范测量的学习。学习半月后，他们将分配在陕西渭南一带进行测量工作。　（星光）
