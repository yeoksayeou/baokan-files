Xinhua News Agency, August 10th: A State Department spokesman confirmed in a statement on August 9th that the Syngman Rhee clique's recent frantic actions of coercing the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) to withdraw from South Korea were supported by the United States. The State Department said in the statement, "Our public attitude is that we are sympathetic to the Republic of Korea."

The State Department had to say in the statement that "the United States has an obligation to comply with the terms of the armistice agreement, including protecting the personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and will adhere to this obligation." However, the statement did not condemn the Syngman Rhee clique's open violation of the armistice agreement and attacks on the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, but instead, groundlessly counter-attacked, saying that "the Communists have been undermining efforts to maintain the armistice agreement."

On the same day that the State Department issued this statement in Washington, the Syngman Rhee clique also issued a so-called detailed report in Seoul, wantonly slandering the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. At the same time, South Korea's acting Foreign Minister, Cho Jeong-hwan, once again clamored that if the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission did not leave South Korea by the deadline stipulated in the Syngman Rhee clique's ultimatum, midnight on the 13th, they could not be responsible for "events that the commission might encounter."

According to Western news agencies, South Korea's provocations are continuing to develop. Demonstrations continued in Incheon on the 9th, and Syngman Rhee's thugs continued to surround Wolmi Island, where the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission inspection team was located. On August 9th, 1,500 thugs rushed from Seoul to Incheon to participate in the attack on Wolmi Island. There are reports that approximately 2,000 more discharged ROK army veterans are preparing to depart on the 10th to "march on Wolmi Island." Demonstrations also continued in Busan on the 9th, and thugs again attempted to attack the inspection team's residence. At the same time, thugs in Gangneung, Daegu, and Gunsan continued to gather in front of the inspection team's offices, clamoring and causing trouble.

To date, there has been no news indicating that the United States has taken effective measures to not only protect the safety of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission personnel, but also "comply with the terms of the armistice agreement" and ensure that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission resumes its function of supervising the armistice in South Korea.

It is noteworthy that Lee Hyung-geun, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Syngman Rhee government, and Chung Il-kwon, Army Chief of Staff, issued a joint statement on the 9th, brazenly demanding that the United States resume the Korean War. They also demanded that the United States armed forces continue to remain in South Korea and continue to expand the ROK army.

### 李承晚的暴行得到美国支持

    李承晚的暴行得到美国支持
    新华社十日讯　美国国务院发言人在八月九日发表的一次声明中证实了：李承晚集团最近胁迫中立国监察委员会退出南朝鲜的疯狂行为是得到美国支持的。美国国务院在这篇声明中说，“我们公开的态度是，我们对大韩民国是同情的”。
    美国国务院不得不在声明中说，“美国有义务遵守停战协定的条款，其中包括保护中立国监察委员会人员在内，并且将恪守这种义务”。但是，这篇声明一个字也不去谴责李承晚集团公开破坏停战协定和攻击中立国监察委员会的暴行，反而毫无根据地反咬一口，说什么“共产党人一直在破坏维持停战协定的努力”。
    就在美国国务院在华盛顿发表这个声明的同一天，李承晚集团也在汉城以同样的调子发表了一份所谓详细报告，对中立国监察委员会的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员滥肆诬蔑。同时，南朝鲜的代理外务部长官曹正焕也再一次叫嚣如果中立国监察委员会不在李承晚集团的最后通牒中所规定的限期十三日午夜以前离开南朝鲜，就不能对这个“委员会可能遭遇到的事件”负责。
    据西方通讯社报道，南朝鲜的挑衅行为目前还在继续发展中。仁川在九日继续有示威，李承晚集团的暴徒仍然包围着中立国监察委员会视察小组所在地的月尾岛。八月九日有一千五百名暴徒从汉城赶到仁川去参加对月尾岛的攻击，有消息说，又有约两千名李伪军退伍军人准备在十日出发，“向月尾岛进军”。釜山在九日也继续有示威，暴徒并且再次试图攻击视察小组驻地。同时，江陵、大邱和群山的暴徒继续聚集在视察小组办公处的门前鼓噪捣乱。
    到现在为止，并没有任何消息说明美国采取了有效的措施，除了保护中立国监察委员会人员的安全而外，并且“遵守停战协定的条款”保证中立国监察委员会恢复在南朝鲜监督停战的职能。
    引起人们注意的是，李承晚政府参谋长联席会议主席李亨根和陆军参谋长丁一权在九日发表联合声明，肆无忌惮地要求美国恢复朝鲜战争。他们还要求美国武装部队继续留在南朝鲜，并且继续扩充李伪军。
