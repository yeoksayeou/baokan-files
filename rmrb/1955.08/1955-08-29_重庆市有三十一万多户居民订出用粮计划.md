Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 28th. By August 25th, over 310,000 households in Chongqing had developed grain consumption plans. Because planned grain consumption reduces grain waste, the majority of families are living better lives. The Guan Jing Xiang Street office recently investigated the grain waste situation of 279 households in the area, and found that, with the exception of four households that still had waste, the rest had reduced their household expenses through economical grain consumption, using the savings to buy more non-staple foods, and some even bought new clothes. Zaozi Lanya resident Wang Hongcheng used the money saved from economical grain consumption to make new clothes for her children. She said, "I only reduced grain waste for two months, and my children are already wearing new clothes, which shows that saving grain is beneficial to both the country and the individual."

Saving grain has given residents a profound socialist education, prompting them to pay more attention to arranging other household expenses. When developing grain consumption plans, residents carefully calculated according to the family's income, and made unified arrangements for monthly expenses, changing the phenomenon of waste caused by blind spending. Zhu Chongxiu, a resident of Ruosetang Lane, has a large family and a small income, and often felt that life was tight. After her family reduced expenses by saving grain, they also paid attention to saving on firewood and coal, and now the family's life seems more comfortable, and the children's tuition difficulties have also been resolved. Liu Defang, the director of the Xuantanmiao Residents' Committee, often educates her four children to cherish grain. Now the children no longer spill rice when eating, nor do they leave leftovers. Liu Defang's good habits have influenced more than a dozen children from the four neighboring families in the same courtyard to pay attention to saving grain.

Chongqing began mobilizing residents to develop grain consumption plans at the end of July. More than 13,000 street activists throughout the city assisted the government in holding mass meetings and residents' group meetings in more than 1,000 residential sections to promote grain conservation. After learning about the benefits of saving grain, many housewives went back and held family meetings to persuade and educate their family members, and jointly discussed and formulated grain-saving pacts and grain-saving plans.

　　重庆市有三十一万多户居民订出用粮计划
    新华社重庆二十八日电　重庆市到八月二十五日止，有三十一万多户居民订出用粮计划。由于按计划用粮减少了粮食浪费，多数家庭的生活过得更好。官井巷街道办事处最近调查当地二百七十九户居民的粮食浪费情况，发现除四户仍存在浪费现象外，其余都从节约用粮中减少了不少的家庭开支，把节余的钱用来增购各种副食品，有的还添置了新衣服。枣子岚垭居民王红成把从节约粮食中省出的钱给孩子做了新衣服，她说：“我才在两个月中减少了粮食浪费，小孩就穿得一身新，可见节约粮食对国家和个人都有好处。”
    节约粮食使居民们受到了一次深刻的社会主义教育，推动他们更好地注意安排家庭的其他开支。居民们在订用粮计划时，根据全家的收入精打细算，把每月的开支统一作了安排，改变了盲目开支造成浪费的现象。若瑟堂巷居民朱崇秀家中人口多，收入较少，经常感到日子过得较紧。她家从节约用粮减少开支后，又注意从烧柴用煤等多方面节约，现在家庭生活显得宽裕了，孩子的学费困难也得到解决。玄坛庙居民委员会主任委员刘德芳，经常教育她的四个孩子爱惜粮食，现在孩子们吃饭时不再撒饭，不再剩饭。刘德芳家的良好习惯，影响同院四家邻居的十几个小孩也注意节约粮食。
    重庆市发动居民订用粮计划是从七月底开始的。全市有一万三千多个街道积极分子协助政府在一千多个居民段中召开群众大会和居民小组会，展开节约粮食的宣传。许多家庭主妇在了解节约粮食的好处后，回去召开了家庭会议，对家人进行说服教育，共同讨论订出节约粮食公约和节约粮食计划。
