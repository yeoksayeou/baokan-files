    Response to Criticism from This Newspaper

    The article "Such Wasteful Budgeting and Grain Waste Cannot Be Tolerated," published in this newspaper on June 22, criticized the phenomenon of grain waste at the Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Medical College in Wuchang, Wuhan. Recently, the hospital sent a letter of self-criticism. The hospital has decided that in the future, it will conduct a detailed review of grain purchase plans to ensure they are accurate and detailed.

    In order to eliminate the phenomenon of grain waste, the hospital has decided to cook rice according to the number of people. If there is any leftover thin congee, it will be mixed with flour to make steamed buns, or used to make liquid or semi-liquid filtered porridge, etc. If there is leftover cooked rice, it will be saved for second consumption or dried and ground into rice flour. Noodles will be cooked according to the number of people; if it's not enough, more will be cooked, or steamed buns will be used as a supplement; any leftover noodles will be rinsed with water and consumed a second time. Buns, steamed buns, and rolls will be made into sizes of one or two *liang* each, and any leftovers will be eaten next time. Liquids will also be prepared according to the number of people. Ward staff will patiently ask patients how much they can eat and add accordingly to avoid leftovers.

    对本报批评的反应
    六月二十二日本报发表的“不能容许这样浮报预算浪费粮食”一文，批评了武汉市武昌湖北医学院附属医院浪费粮食的现象。最近该院已来信检讨。该院决定今后对购粮计划要加以详细的审核，做到确切详实。
    为了消除浪费粮食的现象，该院决定做饭要按人数下米。有剩余时，如果剩余的是稀饭，就把它合在面里做馒头，或者作流汁或半流汁过滤粥等；剩余的是干饭，就把它留下第二次食用，或晒干磨成米粉。做面条要按人数下锅，不够再煮，或以馒头补充；剩余的用清水漂净，第二次食用。包子、馒头、卷子改做成一、二两大小一个，剩余的下次再吃。流质也按人配制。病房工作人员要耐心询问病人，看病人能吃多少就添多少，以免吃不完。
