How I Approach Grain Rationing
Huang Zhongyi

I am a Hui Muslim and serve as the Public Security Director and Deputy Director of Dapiyuan Street in Lianhu District, Xi'an City. When Xi'an City announced the grain rationing measures, I immediately expressed my support for this brilliant measure and actively promoted the government's policy to the masses. When I talked to my wife about grain rationing, she was worried that there would not be enough grain because she heard that the grain supply would be less than before. I did the math with her regarding our household's grain consumption. Was it really not enough? Actually, it wasn't. My family has four people (two adults and two children aged eight or nine). In the past, we were supplied with 135 catties of grain per month, and we never bought enough (except for one month when relatives came and we ate all the grain). Taking May and June as examples, we could save twenty or thirty catties each month. Was all the grain consumed actually eaten? No, some of it was wasted. Take the children, for example, they couldn't finish the dry steamed buns and left them on the windowsill and in the drawers. According to statistics, they have accumulated seven or eight catties from May to now. In addition, lack of planning in cooking, spoiled leftovers, and scattering flour during cooking are also unavoidable. Now, if we plug these loopholes of wasting grain and budget carefully, the ninety-nine catties supplied to my family (according to the new standard) will be completely sufficient.

Based on the above, we formulated two saving methods: First, we must pay attention to what the children eat at each meal and not give them snacks of steamed buns. Second, we must cook according to the amount needed each time, based on the principle of eating well, eating our fill, and not wasting grain. This saves grain, saves money, and cultivates good habits of saving grain. After this careful calculation, I had a clear idea in my mind and also had a way to help everyone calculate carefully.

When promoting the rationing system, I addressed the masses' fear of not having enough grain by combining the past high grain plan targets and examples of grain waste in the street, and I used my family's specific situation to illustrate that the grain rationing was completely sufficient. Initially, some households thought there was not enough grain, but after calculating carefully, they all said it was enough.

Grain rationing is a very important task. Recently, because I have been busy with grain work, I have not been to the street to sell melons for four or five days. However, as long as the grain work is done well, it will benefit everyone, and it will also benefit me. Currently, I am actively working with the work team to verify the quotas. After the grain rationing begins, I will also regularly go deep into each household to see if there is still blind use and waste of grain, so that I can help them overcome these problems in a timely manner.

　　我是怎样对待粮食定量供应工作的
　　黄忠义
    我是个回民，担任西安市莲湖区大皮院街的治安主任兼街道副主任。当西安市宣布粮食定量供应办法的时候，我首先表示拥护这一英明的措施，并积极地向群众宣传政府的政策。我同我的爱人谈到粮食定量供应时，她听说粮食要比过去供应的少，就担心粮食不够用，我就同她把家中用粮的情况算了算账，是真的不够吗？其实不然。我家共四口人（两个大人，两个八九岁的小孩）。过去每月供应粮食一百三十五斤，月月都没有购足（其中只有一个月，因来了亲戚粮食全部吃光），以五、六两月份为例，每月都能剩余二、三十斤。消耗掉的粮食是否全部都吃下肚子了呢？不是的，其中有些是蹧蹋掉了。拿小孩来说，吃不了丢在窗台上、抽屉里的干馍，据统计，从五月份到现在就积攒了七、八斤。此外，做饭没计划，吃不了放坏的和做饭时面粉的抛撒，也是少不了的事。现在如果把这些浪费粮食的漏洞堵塞，再精打细算，我家供应九十九斤（新的标准），是完全够用的。
    根据以上情况，我们订出了两条节约的办法：第一、要注意孩子吃顿顿饭，不要给零馍吃。第二、每次要按量做饭，以吃好、吃饱不蹧蹋粮食为原则。这样，既省粮，又省钱，同时也养成了节约粮食的好习惯。经过这一算细账，我心中有了数，帮助大家算细账也有了办法。
    在宣传定量供应的时候，我针对群众怕不够用的思想，一方面结合街道上过去粮食计划订的高和浪费粮食的事例，又拿我家的具体情况，来说明粮食定量供应是完全够用的，最初有的户认为粮食不够用，后来算了下细账，也都说够用了。
    粮食定量供应是个很重要的工作，最近因忙于粮食工作，我有四、五天没有到街上去卖瓜了。但是，只要把粮食工作做好，对大家有益，对我也有好处。目前，我正配合工作组积极地核实定量，在粮食开始定量供应后，我还要经常地深入各户，看看是否还有盲目用粮和浪费粮食，好及时帮助克服。（郝健记）
