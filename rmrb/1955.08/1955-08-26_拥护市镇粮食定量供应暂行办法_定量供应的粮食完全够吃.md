　　Supporting the Provisional Measures for Rationed Grain Supply in Municipalities and Towns
　　Rationed Grain Supply is More Than Enough
　　Wang Yiping
    Deheng Store is a grain consignment store in Chongwen District, Beijing, which also sells preserved food. It has a total of eight employees, all of whom eat in the store. In the past, they ate four catties of rice as dry rice porridge in the morning, seven catties of noodles at noon, and porridge and steamed buns in the evening. If there were no steamed buns, they would buy some baked cakes outside. With this way of eating, not counting the cooked food bought outside, eight people consumed about three hundred catties of grain per month. In June, someone went home, and the total grain consumption was 261 catties. This was considered a month with less grain consumption.

    At the end of June, when Deheng Store was setting its grain purchase plan for July, seven of the eight people advocated sticking to the 300+ catties. Only Yin Futian advocated setting a smaller amount. He was the director of the Chongwen District Store Employees' Union and a member of the District Thrift Committee. He understood the significance of conserving grain and wanted to take the lead in setting a lower plan. He believed that even though someone went home in June, resulting in less grain consumption, as long as everyone paid attention to conservation in July, it would be almost enough. So, under his leadership, they set a grain consumption plan of 261 catties. However, after the plan was set, everyone's ideological understanding was not unified. At that time, zucchini was relatively cheap, and Yin Futian suggested eating more zucchini and less noodles, but no one paid attention to him. Some people, seeing his large appetite, even jokingly said to him, "Let's split the grain and eat separately!"

    Later, everyone visited the Beijing Grain Conservation Exhibition, and the trade union and grain industry continuously held meetings to educate people about conserving grain, so everyone's understanding of grain conservation improved compared to the past. However, because they did not pay attention to conservation in the previous stage, they cooked the same way as before. The originally planned 261 catties of grain were finished by the morning of the 26th. Then, they applied for an additional 40 catties, but they were still a little short by the end of the month, and the total grain consumption for the whole month was 301 catties. On July 31st, they still ate porridge and bought steamed buns outside. Everyone also felt that this way of eating was not sustainable and that they had to find ways to improve.

    In August, Chongwen District implemented a pilot program of rationed grain supply in the jurisdiction of the Luban Museum Police Station. According to the pilot rationed supply standard, each store employee was supplied with 31 catties of grain per month. Their eight people could only buy 248 catties of grain per month, which was less than their past actual consumption. But this time, everyone's mood was higher than before. One person said, "This is a trial, let's still eat the way we used to, and supplement it if it's not enough." This statement was immediately opposed. The eight people jointly studied whether it was enough to eat. Everyone believed that the volunteers used to eat a handful of fried rice and a handful of snow, and they still paid attention to saving grain for the country. Now that our environment is so good, why can't we save? Moreover, according to the amount of labor of each person in the store, standing at the counter every day is not heavy labor, and 31 catties per month is enough if planned well.

    After detailed calculations, the average daily grain consumption was eight catties. They changed breakfast to two catties of sorghum rice porridge; at noon, they ate less noodles and more steamed buns and corn bread. Five catties of noodles for steamed buns would still leave some for the evening. When eating corn bread, four catties of noodles were enough. After trying this for a few days, eight catties of grain a day was enough. With enough rationed grain to eat, everyone felt confident, and they asked to change the way they ate. Some time ago, some potatoes were mixed into the supplied grain, so they used potatoes mixed with flour to make pancakes. The pancakes were delicious and filling, but they were too difficult for older employees to eat, so they changed to steaming rolls with potatoes and flour, which everyone loved. Recently, after the potatoes were finished, they found a way to eat dry rice and porridge together. When eating porridge in the morning, they would eat steamed buns at noon; when eating dry rice in the morning, they would eat corn bread at noon; every few days, they could also eat noodles once. In August, up to the 24th, they had not bought cooked food outside, and the average daily consumption did not exceed eight catties of grain.

    During the pilot rationed supply program, comrades from the neighborhood committee and the work group all told them that if it was really not enough, they could adjust some from households with surplus. (In the entire electoral district, most households could not finish the rationed grain, and many households had already handed over the surplus grain coupons to the neighborhood committee, requesting that they be adjusted to those who did not have enough or returned to the state.) But none of the eight people said that it was not enough to eat. They believed that the state's rationing according to labor was the most reasonable. In their free time, they often said: In the past, although verifying the supply reduced waste, one person had one appetite, and even though they were all store employees, the planned grain consumption was different. How could the state control this? Now that it is set like this, it is also good for each person to arrange their own life. Several workers have families in the countryside. They said: In the past, because we worked in the grain store, we didn't have to worry about not having grain to eat, and we had to eat dry food in the morning; in fact, we all ate porridge at home in the morning since we were little. Now, standing at the counter every day is much easier than farming in the fields, and eating porridge in the morning is completely fine. They have enough to eat themselves, and they often conduct propaganda among store employees, introducing their own experiences so that everyone can cook according to the rationed supply standards.

　　拥护市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法
　　定量供应的粮食完全够吃
　　王一平
    德恒店是北京市崇文区的一个粮食代销店，兼营酱食，一共有八个职工，都在店内吃饭。过去每天早上吃四斤米的干饭，中午七斤面的面条，晚上吃稀饭、馒头，没有馒头就在外面买点贴饼。像这样吃法，不算在外买的熟食，八个人每月吃粮总在三百斤上下。六月份有人回家了，共用粮二百六十一斤。这算是用粮较少的一个月。
    六月底，德恒店在定七月份购粮计划的时候，八个人有七个主张还按三百多斤定，只有尹福田主张少定一些，他是崇文区店员组联会的主任，又是区节约委员会的委员，懂得节约粮食的意义，也想带头把计划订得少一点，他认为六月份虽是有人回家，少吃了粮食，但是七月份只要大家注意节约也差不多够了。于是由他作主，订了二百六十一斤的用粮计划。计划订了，大家的思想认识并没有统一。那时菜蔬中西葫芦比较便宜，尹福田提出多吃西葫芦少吃面的办法，没人理他，有人见他的饭量大，还半开玩笑似地对他说：“把粮食分开，各吃各的吧！”
    后来，大家参观了北京市节约粮食展览会，工会和粮食行业又不断开会进行节约粮食的教育，大家对节约粮食的认识也比过去提高了。可是由于前一阶段没注意节约，做饭还同过去一样，原订的二百六十一斤粮食，到二十六号早上就吃完了，以后又申请追加了四十斤，吃到月底还差一点，全月共用粮三百零一斤，七月三十一号还是吃的稀饭，出外买的馒头。大家也感到这样吃法不行，要想办法改进。
    八月，崇文区在鲁班馆派出所管区内试行粮食定量供应的办法，按照试行的定量供应标准，店员工人每人每月供应三十一斤粮食。他们八个人每月只能买二百四十八斤粮食，比过去的实际消耗量少了。但是这次大家的情绪反比过去高了。有一个人说：“这是试验的，咱还按过去那样吃，不够再补。”这个说法立刻遭到了反对。八个人共同研究了够不够吃的问题，大家认为：志愿军过去吃一把炒米一把雪，还注意为祖国节约粮食，我们现在环境这样好，为什么不能节约呢？而且按照店里各人的劳动量来说，每天站柜台，没有什么重劳动，每月三十一斤，只要计划得好也是够吃的了。
    经过详细计算，每天平均用粮八斤。把早饭改成二斤高粮米粥；中午少吃面条，多吃馒头和窝窝头，五斤面的馒头，还能剩一些晚上吃，吃窝窝头时四斤面就够了；晚上再煮一斤高粮米的粥，加上中午剩的馒头。像这样试吃了几天，一天八斤粮食足够了。定量供应的粮食够吃了，心里有了数，大家又要求换换花样吃。前些时在供应的粮食里搭配了一些马铃薯，他们就用马铃薯掺面粉烙饼，烙出来的饼好吃又耐饿，但是年纪大一点的职工吃起来太费劲，又改用马铃薯掺面蒸卷子，这样大家都爱吃了。最近马铃薯吃完了，他们又想办法把干饭稀饭搭配吃，早上吃稀饭时，中午就吃馒头；早上吃干饭，中午就吃窝窝头；隔几天也能吃一次面条。八月份，吃到二十四日为止，没有到外面买熟食，平均每天并不超过八斤粮食。
    在试行定量供应办法的过程中，居民委员会和工作组的同志都对他们说过：如果实在不够，可以从多余的户里调剂一些给他们。（全选区内大部分户按定量供应的粮食都吃不完，已经有不少户把多余的粮票交给居民委员会，要求调剂给不够吃的或是交还国家。）但是八个人中没有一个说不够吃的。他们认为国家这样按劳动定量是最合理的，在闲谈时他们常说：过去核实供应，虽是减少了浪费，但是一人一个饭量，同是店员工人，订的用粮计划就不一样，国家怎样掌握呢？像现在这样订下来，各人自己也好安排生活。有几个工人家在农村，他们说：过去因为在粮店里做活，不愁没粮吃，早上也要吃干的；其实我们从小在家早上都是吃稀的，现在每天站站柜台，比地里的农活轻多了，早上吃稀饭是完全可以的。他们自己够吃了，还经常在店员工人中进行宣传，把自己的经验介绍出去，让大家都能按定量供应的标准做饭。
