    The obligation to fulfill the Geneva Accords cannot be circumvented
    The South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem government issued a statement on the 10th, refusing to consult with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the issue of general elections in Vietnam in accordance with the Geneva Accords. This is a serious step by the Ngo Dinh Diem government in persisting in violating the Geneva Accords and obstructing the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, and therefore cannot but arouse the serious attention of peace-loving people, especially the countries concerned in the Geneva Accords.
    The Ngo Dinh Diem government attempts to deny its undeniable obligations to the Geneva Accords, claiming that "it is in no way bound by the Geneva Accords that it has not signed." This kind of evasion is completely untenable. Article 7 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Convention and Article 14(a) of the Vietnam Ceasefire Agreement clearly stipulate the responsibility of the representative authorities of both regions to consult on holding general elections. At the same time, Article 27 of the Vietnam Ceasefire Agreement also stipulates: "The signatories of this document and their successors in office shall be responsible for ensuring the observance and implementation of all clauses and provisions of this Agreement." Therefore, as Indian Prime Minister Nehru pointed out at a press conference on July 19, the South Vietnamese government, having inherited its position from the French authorities, cannot but be bound by the Geneva Accords.
    The Ngo Dinh Diem government also fabricated excuses, slandering that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam region does not have "conditions for free voting," in order to cover up its unreasonable position of openly refusing to consult on general elections. This also cannot deceive anyone. The people of North Vietnam enjoy full freedom and democracy under the leadership of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, a fact that no slander can obliterate. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly stated that the general election should be held in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords. At a press conference on June 6, Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong specifically stated that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam advocates holding free general elections throughout Vietnam and providing the necessary guarantees for the preparation, organization, and conduct of the general election, especially guaranteeing the freedom of electoral activities for all political parties, groups, and individuals. There is no room for doubt about the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's open and aboveboard attitude of respecting the Geneva Accords and seeking consensus between the two sides. The Geneva Accords have already stipulated that the general election will be held under the supervision of an international commission, and representatives from both the North and South regions will consult on this issue. Consultation is precisely to provide the necessary guarantees and take the necessary measures for both sides to ensure that the general election is held under the free conditions strictly in accordance with the Geneva Accords.
    Now the Ngo Dinh Diem government refuses to conduct consultations in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords, but empty-handedly shouts "unify the country in peace and freedom," while doing its best to slander North Vietnam for not having freedom, using this rumor-mongering as an excuse for its refusal to consult. It is obvious that it does not want Vietnam to hold truly free general elections. The Ngo Dinh Diem government's denial of its obligations to the Geneva Accords and its refusal to consult show that it is afraid that the Vietnamese people will have a real opportunity and the conditions to freely express their will. Because this will has nothing in common with the Ngo Dinh Diem government's policy of implementing dictatorial terror rule in South Vietnam and attempting to offer South Vietnam to the United States as a military base and colony.
    As everyone knows, it is in South Vietnam, not North Vietnam, that there is a serious police rule that infringes on democracy and restricts freedom. In order to strangle the national aspirations and democratic and free rights of the South Vietnamese people, from the ceasefire to May of this year, the Ngo Dinh Diem regime has violated the Geneva Accords and carried out retaliatory massacres of patriots and incidents of human rights violations, according to incomplete statistics, reaching more than 3,000 cases, killing thousands of people, and wounding and arresting tens of thousands of people. In provinces such as Phu Yen, Quang Nam, Quang Tri, Quang Ngai, and Binh Dinh, the Ngo Dinh Diem regime also launched the so-called "eradication of communism" campaign, and suppressed all those who demanded independence, unity, democracy, and freedom under the pretext of "anti-communism." According to Saigon newspapers, by the end of May alone, more than 3,300 patriotic people had been arrested in Quang Tri province, and in Quang Nam province, in addition to more than 1,300 people being arrested, 520 people were beaten to death or injured by Ngo Dinh Diem's military police and secret agents.
    Recently, the Ngo Dinh Diem government even openly declared that it would "take severe measures" to massively suppress the people who demanded consultative conferences and general elections. Patriotic demonstrations by people in Saigon, My Tho, Can Tho, Sa Dec, Tay Ninh, Bien Hoa, and other places demanding general elections were all subjected to armed suppression by the Ngo Dinh Diem regime, and large numbers of people were arrested, killed, and injured. The Ngo Dinh Diem regime also dispatched a large number of military police in central and southern Vietnam to conduct "sweeps" against the people. The French "International Forum" weekly described in a report on July 22 that the Ngo Dinh Diem government "used all police harassment that Western society has never seen" against the people.
    In order to eliminate dissidents and establish dictatorial rule, Ngo Dinh Diem also launched a civil war in South Vietnam, which is also well known. Even the Associated Press said on June 13 that Ngo Dinh Diem's government had "become a government that is now completely concentrated on himself."
    These facts prove that now is the time to demand that "conditions for free life and free voting" be guaranteed in South Vietnam, and that all terrorist acts that violate the democratic and free rights of the South Vietnamese people be stopped immediately. The Ngo Dinh Diem government's refusal to consult and its slander of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is an attempt to divert people's attention from these facts of violating the Geneva Accords and suppressing democratic freedom that are happening in South Vietnam.
    The Ngo Dinh Diem government's refusal to consult has even more serious implications. As everyone knows, after the Geneva Four-Power Summit, the international situation has eased, and a favorable situation has emerged in the Far East for striving for further easing. These prospects are obviously extremely unpalatable to certain forces internationally. The Ngo Dinh Diem government's blatant refusal to assume the obligations of the Geneva Accords, and the actions of the Lee Seung-man group in South Korea now threatening to cancel the Korean Armistice Agreement, are all part of the conspiracy of these international forces to undermine the atmosphere of international reconciliation and obstruct the easing of the situation.
    People are uneasily noting the attitude of the United States, one of the main participants in the Geneva Conference. As early as March 8, US Secretary of State Dulles said that "it would be difficult to create conditions in the north where people can have a real choice of freedom." On June 28, Dulles again said that the Vietnamese general election could only be held under so-called "truly free conditions." These are precisely the tones of the Ngo Dinh Diem government's recent statements. Not only that, on the same day that the Ngo Dinh Diem government issued its statement on the 10th, Dulles immediately stated in Washington that "the United States supports the position taken by Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem." This attitude of the United States, which in effect encourages the Ngo Dinh Diem government to refuse to fulfill the Geneva Accords, is obviously contradictory to the US government's repeated expressions of its desire to lead to peace and ease international tensions. Everyone knows that restoring the unification of Vietnam through free general elections is the basic key to respecting the national sovereignty of the Vietnamese people and consolidating peace in Indochina. If the Geneva Accords are allowed to be undermined, and the decision in the agreement on holding consultations and arranging free general elections is discarded, it will not ease the international situation in the Far East but will bring dangerous consequences. Therefore, people have reason to demand that the US government no longer encourage the South Vietnamese authorities' rhetoric and actions that undermine the Geneva Accords, but use its influence in a way that is conducive to consolidating peace in Indochina and respecting the national independence of Vietnam.
    The Geneva Accords cannot be undermined, and the obligation to fulfill the agreement cannot be circumvented. For the sake of peace and the independence of the Vietnamese nation, all peace-loving people in the world and countries that care about the Indochina situation cannot sit idly by and watch the Ngo Dinh Diem government and its supporters' behavior of defying international agreements. In particular, the governments of the countries concerned in the Geneva Conference should work together to stop the South Vietnamese authorities' actions to undermine the Geneva Accords and implement the fulfillment of the Geneva Accords. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has been making unremitting efforts to hold consultative conferences, realize general elections, and unify the country. The attitude of the Chinese and Soviet governments in actively advocating that all parties concerned thoroughly fulfill the Geneva Accords has always been very clear. Spokesmen for the British Foreign Office issued statements on the 9th and 10th, stating that Britain still believes that consultations should be started in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords, and expressed due dissatisfaction with the Ngo Dinh Diem government's statement. The French Foreign Ministry also issued a communiqué on the 10th, believing that "nothing should be done to hinder the implementation of the Geneva Accords." It should be said that these expressions of Britain and France are an expression in the right direction and are welcome. However, the overall situation has not shown signs of improvement, and people have reason to demand that the countries concerned in the Geneva Conference conduct consultations to prevent this situation from continuing to develop.

### 履行日内瓦协议的义务是不容规避的

    履行日内瓦协议的义务是不容规避的
    南越吴庭艳政府在十日发表声明，拒绝按照日内瓦协议同越南民主共和国政府就越南普选问题进行协商。这是吴庭艳政府坚持违反日内瓦协议、阻挠越南和平统一的严重步骤，因此不能不引起爱好和平人民特别是日内瓦协议有关国家的严重注意。
    吴庭艳政府企图抵赖它对日内瓦协议的无可推托的义务，声称“它丝毫不受它未曾签字的日内瓦协议的约束”。这种遁词是完全站不住脚的。日内瓦会议最后宣言第七条和越南停止敌对行动协定第十四条甲款，都清楚地规定了双方地区有代表性当局协商举行普选的责任。同时，越南停止敌对行动协定第二十七条还规定：“本文件签署者及其职务的继承者均应负责保障对本协定的各项条款和规定的遵守和实施。”因此，正如印度总理尼赫鲁七月十九日在记者招待会上所指出的，南越政府既然从法国当局手中继承了职务，就不能不受日内瓦协议的约束。
    吴庭艳政府还制造借口，诬蔑越南民主共和国地区没有“自由投票的条件”，以掩饰它公然拒绝协商普选的无理立场。这也是骗不了任何人的。越南北方的人民在越南民主共和国政府领导下享有充分的自由和民主，这个事实不是任何诽谤所能抹煞得了的。越南民主共和国政府曾一再声明普选要按照日内瓦协议的规定举行。范文同副总理在六月六日的记者招待会上还具体地说明：越南民主共和国政府主张在全越南举行自由普选，对于筹备、组织和进行普选的工作提供必要的保证，尤其是保证各政党、团体和个人竞选活动的自由。越南民主共和国这种尊重日内瓦协议和谋求双方一致的光明正大的态度，没有任何可以怀疑的余地。日内瓦协议已经规定，普选将在一个国际委员会的监督下举行，而南北双方地区的代表又要就这个问题进行协商。协商正是为了双方提供必要的保证，采取必要的措施，使普选在严格按照日内瓦协议规定的自由的条件下举行。
    现在吴庭艳政府拒绝按照日内瓦协议规定进行协商，而空喊“在和平和自由中统一全国”，同时竭力诬蔑越南北方没有自由，把这种造谣诽谤作为它拒绝协商的借口。它不愿意越南举行真正自由的普选是显而易见的。吴庭艳政府抵赖它对日内瓦协议的义务，拒绝协商，就说明它害怕越南人民真正有机会和有条件自由地表现他们的意志。因为这种意志，是同吴庭艳政府在南越施行独裁恐怖统治和企图把南越奉送给美国作为军事基地和殖民地的政策毫无共同之处的。
    大家知道，正是在越南南方而不是北方，存在着严重的侵犯民主、束缚自由的警察统治。为了绞杀南越人民的民族愿望和民主、自由权利，从停战到今年五月，吴庭艳政权违反日内瓦协议，对爱国者施行报复屠杀和侵犯人权的事件，据不完全的统计，已达三千多起，杀害了数千人，打伤和逮捕了数万人。在富安、广南、广治、广义、平定等省，吴庭艳政权还发动所谓“根绝共产党”运动，并以“反共”为借口镇压一切要求独立、统一、民主、自由的人。据西贡报纸透露，到五月底为止，仅广治省就有三千三百多名爱国的人民被捕，在广南省除了有一千三百多人被捕之外，还有五百二十人被吴庭艳军警特务打死打伤。
    最近，吴庭艳政府甚至公开声言要“采取严峻的措施”来大规模地镇压要求举行协商会议、举行普选的人民。西贡、美荻、芹苴、沙沥、西宁、边和等地人民进行的要求举行普选的爱国示威，都遭受了吴庭艳政权的武装镇压，大批的人民被逮捕和被打死、打伤。吴庭艳政权并在中越南部出动大批军警，向人民进行“扫荡”。法国“国际论坛”周报在七月二十二日报道中就形容吴庭艳政府对人民是“使用了西方社会所没有见过的一切警察骚扰”。
    为了排除异己、建立独裁统治，吴庭艳还在南越发动了内战，这也是人所熟知的。甚至连美联社在六月十三日也说：吴庭艳的政府已经“弄成了现在完全集中于他自己一身的一个政府”。
    这些事实证明，现在正是应该要求在南越保证“自由生活和自由投票的条件”，立即停止一切侵犯南越人民民主自由权利的恐怖行动。吴庭艳政府拒绝协商，并诬蔑越南民主共和国，是想转移人们对在南越发生的这些违反日内瓦协议和镇压民主自由的事实的注意。
    吴庭艳政府拒绝协商，还有其更严重的意义。大家知道，日内瓦四大国首脑会议以后，国际局势有了和缓，在远东已出现了争取进一步和缓的有利形势。这些前景显然极其不合乎国际上某些势力的胃口。吴庭艳政府公然拒绝承担日内瓦协议的义务，和现在南朝鲜李承晚集团威胁要取消朝鲜停战协定的行动，都是这些国际势力企图破坏国际和解气氛、阻挠局势和缓的阴谋的一部分。
    人们不安地注意到日内瓦会议主要参加国之一的美国的态度。早在三月八日，美国国务卿杜勒斯就说过“要在北部创造可以让人们有真正选择的自由的条件会是困难的”。六月二十八日，杜勒斯又说越南普选只能在所谓“真正自由的条件下举行”。这些正是吴庭艳政府最近的声明的调子。不但这样，在十日吴庭艳政府发表声明的同一天，杜勒斯马上就在华盛顿表示“美国支持吴庭艳总理所持的立场”。美国这种实际上鼓励吴庭艳政府拒绝履行日内瓦协议的态度，显然是同美国政府最近一再表示的希望导向和平和和缓国际紧张局势的愿望矛盾的。谁都知道，通过自由普选来恢复越南的统一，是尊重越南人民的民族主权、巩固印度支那和平的基本关键。如果容许日内瓦协议受破坏，协议中关于举行协商、安排自由普选的决定被抛弃，那就不会使远东国际局势和缓而将会带来危险的后果。因此人们有理由要求美国政府不再鼓励南越当局破坏日内瓦协议的言论和行动，而把它的影响运用于有利于巩固印度支那和平和尊重越南民族独立的方面。
    日内瓦协议不容破坏，履行协议的义务不容规避。为了和平和越南民族独立的利益，全世界一切爱好和平的人民和关心印度支那局势的国家，都不能坐视吴庭艳政府和它的支持者这种蔑视国际协议的行为。特别是日内瓦会议有关各国政府都应该共同努力，来制止南越当局破坏日内瓦协议的行动，贯彻日内瓦协议的履行。越南民主共和国政府一直为举行协商会议、实现普选和统一进行着不懈的努力。中国和苏联的政府积极主张有关各方彻底履行日内瓦协议的态度一向是十分明确的。英国外交部发言人在九日和十日发表谈话，表示英国仍然认为应当按照日内瓦协议的规定开始进行协商，并对吴庭艳政府的声明表示了应有的不满。法国外交部也在十日发表公报，认为“不应该做任何事情来阻碍日内瓦协定的履行”。应该说，英法这些表示都是朝着正确方向的一种表示，值得欢迎。但是，整个情况并没有好转的征象，人们有理由要求日内瓦会议有关国家进行协商，制止这种情况继续发展。
