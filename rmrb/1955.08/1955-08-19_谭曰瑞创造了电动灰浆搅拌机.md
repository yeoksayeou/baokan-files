    Tan Ruerui Creates Electric Mortar Mixer
    Hu Shixin
    Tan Ruerui is an old worker with over twenty years of experience at the Northwest Fifth Engineering Company. In the past three years, he has successively created six or seven advanced production tools and operating methods for carpenters, bricklayers, and cement workers. These advanced tools include the "Model Purlin Marking Machine," "Locally Made Model Board," "Paper Pulp Rolling Machine," and "Electric Mortar Mixer." Therefore, he has been selected as a labor model every year for the past three years.
    Currently, the "Electric Mortar Mixer" created by Tan Ruerui has been widely used in various construction sites of the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau. Using this machine can increase production efficiency by more than two times, reduce the heavy physical labor of workers, eliminate the phenomenon of idling due to waiting for mortar, and ensure quality by extending the mortar mixing time. According to the calculations of the Fifth Engineering Company, using an electric mixer to mix mortar can save ten man-days per machine per day. The company has adopted a total of seventeen "Electric Mortar Mixers," which can save one hundred and seventy man-days per day.
    The "Electric Mortar Mixer" was created by Tan Ruerui when he was the leader of the carpentry team at the People's Flour Mill construction site. At that time, the workers on the entire construction site were enthusiastically engaged in a labor competition, and good news of various types of work exceeding quotas came one after another. Only the bricklayers' performance was poor, mainly because the mortar supply could not keep up. Moreover, the quality of manually mixed mortar was poor. Bricklayers needed to chip off mortar lumps while laying bricks. When Tan Ruerui learned that the bricklayers were affecting the progress of the project due to insufficient mortar supply, he thought, "How can we ensure the overall completion of the task if this continues? We must help them find a solution." At first, he thought of using half a round iron bucket, installing a central axis and iron teeth, and rocking it back and forth to mix the mortar. But this could only mix the mortar, not discharge it, and the mortar still had to be scooped out manually, so he overturned this idea. He then began to create a mixer that could load and discharge mortar at the same time, and have mortar available whenever it was needed. He borrowed some machine parts from other units and spent several days making a wooden model. The first time he tested it with sawdust, the model blew the sawdust away like a fan when someone rocked it. At that time, some visiting technicians poured cold water on him, saying, "Is this a fan? It's only good for sweeping chaff for farmers!" Some workers, fearing that they would lose their jobs if there was a machine, also said that it would not succeed. But Tan Ruerui was not discouraged. He repeatedly considered and improved the machine and the mortar feeding method, and asked the leadership to conduct iron model tests. Some staff at the construction site felt that making iron models was too expensive, and still wanted to make wooden ones. However, this type of machine was not easy to use with wooden models, so he was determined to use his own savings to make iron ones. If the experiment was successful, it would be considered the property of the public; if it failed, it would be his own loss. Later, the company leadership learned about this and convened a special meeting to study the mortar mixer. At the meeting, everyone unanimously agreed to conduct iron model tests and made many suggestions for improvement. After the meeting, Tan Ruerui made further improvements based on everyone's opinions, and thus, an "Electric Mortar Mixer" was successfully created.
    In May of this year, Tan Ruerui was transferred to a new construction site to promote advanced experience. He began to create an "Electric Mortar Conveyor" for high-rise buildings, which would transport mortar from the ground to multi-story buildings, and connect it to the "Electric Mortar Mixer" with wooden buckets. Drawings have now been made and are being researched and tested.

    谭曰瑞创造了电动灰浆搅拌机
    扈世鑫
    谭曰瑞是西北第五工程公司一个二十多年工龄的老工人，近三年来，他先后创造了六、七种木工、瓦工和水泥工用的先进生产工具和操作方法，这些先进工具中有“模型划檩条机”“土制模型板”“压纸筋滚”和“电动灰浆搅拌机”等。因此，三年来，他年年被选为劳动模范。
    目前，西北工程管理总局各工地已经普遍使用了谭曰瑞创造的“电动灰浆搅拌机”。使用这种机器可以提高生产效率二倍多，并且减轻了工人笨重的体力劳动，消灭了以往因等灰浆而窝工的现象，又由于灰浆搅拌时间的延长，保证了质量。据第五工程公司计算，用电动搅拌机搅拌灰浆，每天每部机器可节省十个人工，全公司共采用了十七部“电动灰浆搅拌机”，每天就可节省一百七十个人工。
    “电动灰浆搅拌机”是谭曰瑞在人民面粉厂工地担任木工小组长的时候创造的。当时，全工地上的工人们正热烈地展开劳动竞赛，各种工种突破定额的喜讯一个连一个传来，只有瓦工的成绩差，主要原因是灰浆供应不上。而且人工搅拌的灰浆质量不好。瓦工们需要一边砌砖一边剔灰疙瘩，谭曰瑞知道了瓦工因为灰浆供应不上而影响工程进度，心想“这样下去怎么能保证全面完成任务呢？一定帮助他们想个办法才行。”开始他想用半个圆铁桶，安个中轴、铁齿，来回摇动拌灰。但这只能拌灰，不能出灰，还得用人工把灰浆掏出来，于是他把这个想法推翻了。又开始创造一个能够一边装灰，一边出灰，而且几时用就几时有灰浆的搅拌机，他在别的单位借了些机器零件，用了几天的时间做了个木模型。第一次用锯末试验，人一摇动，模型就像风扇一样，把锯末吹跑了。当时就有参观的技术人员泼冷水，说：“这是个风扇吧？给农民扫糠还行！”有些工人恐怕有了机器自己失业，也说不会成功。但谭曰瑞并没有灰心，他反复考虑，又改进了机器和进灰方法，并要求领导上做铁模型试验，工地有些工作人员嫌制造铁模型花钱多，仍叫做木头的。但是这种机器做木模型不好用，于是他下定决心自己积蓄钱做铁的，试验成功算公家的，不成功就算自己的。后来，这件事被公司领导上知道了，就召开了专门研究灰浆搅拌机的会议，会上大家一致同意做铁模型试验，并提了许多改进意见。会后，谭曰瑞根据大家的意见又进行了改进，于是，一部“电动灰浆搅拌机”创造成功了。
    今年五月，谭曰瑞又调到一个新的工地，担任推广先进经验的工作，他又开始创造一种高层建筑物用的“电动运灰浆机”，把灰浆从平地上送到多层的建筑物上，并用木斗和“电动灰浆搅拌机”连接在一起。现在已画出图样正在研究试验中。
