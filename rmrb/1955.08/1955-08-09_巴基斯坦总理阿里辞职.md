Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 8th: Karachi dispatch: According to official announcement, Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Ali resigned on the 7th after the ruling Muslim League refused to let him continue as the party's leader. Acting Governor-General of Pakistan Iskander Mirza immediately requested Muhammad Ali to continue in office until the new cabinet is sworn in.

The Muslim League parliamentary party had held a meeting earlier on the 7th and elected current Finance Minister Chaudhry Muhammad Ali to replace Muhammad Ali as the party leader.

Muhammad Ali's resignation is considered to be the result of the political crisis in Pakistan and internal disagreements within the Muslim League over cabinet formation. The Muslim League failed to win a majority of seats in the recently held Constituent Assembly elections. It controls only 35 of the 80 seats in the new Constituent Assembly. According to a Reuters Karachi dispatch, Muhammad Ali advocated forming a cabinet in conjunction with the East Pakistan United Front, which holds 16 seats in the Constituent Assembly, but this proposal was rejected by Muslim League leaders. The dispatch stated that the Muslim League parliamentary party has authorized Chaudhry Muhammad Ali to consult with opposition parties, including the East Pakistan People's Muslim League, in order to obtain a majority in the Constituent Assembly.

    巴基斯坦总理阿里辞职
    新华社新德里八日电　喀喇蚩消息：据官方宣布，巴基斯坦总理穆罕默德·阿里七日在执政党回教联盟拒绝他继续当党的领袖以后已经辞掉总理职务。巴基斯坦代理总督伊斯坎德尔·米尔扎当即要求穆罕默德·阿里继续执政，直到新内阁宣誓就职时为止。
    回教联盟议会党团曾在七日早些时候举行会议，选出现任财政部长乔德里·穆罕默德·阿里代替穆罕默德·阿里为党的领袖。
    穆罕默德·阿里的辞职被认为是巴基斯坦政治危机和回教联盟内部在组阁问题上意见分歧的结果。回教联盟在最近举行的制宪议会选举中没有能够获得多数席位。它在新制宪议会全部八十个议席当中只控制了三十五席。据路透社喀喇蚩消息说，穆罕默德·阿里主张同在制宪议会中拥有十六席的东巴基斯坦联合阵线联合组织内阁，但是这个主张遭到回教联盟领导人士的拒绝。消息说，回教联盟议会党团已经授权乔德里·穆罕默德·阿里同包括东巴基斯坦人民回教联盟在内的反对党进行协商，以便取得制宪议会中的多数。
