    发表政纲并决定参加今年九月的普选
    新华社河内四日电　柬埔寨消息：柬埔寨前抗战人员组成的政治组织“人民派”已经宣告成立，并且决定参加今年九月十一日举行的普选。由于人民的支持，这个组织已经被柬埔寨王国政府批准可以进行活动。
    柬埔寨“民族报”在七月二十八日登载了“人民派”的声明。这个声明指出，“人民派”的任务是：巩固和平，完成祖国的独立，实现民主自由，改善和提高人民生活水平，发展民族的经济、政治和文化。
    “人民派”在声明中还提出了具体的斗争目标：反对外国干涉柬埔寨内政；反对把柬埔寨拉入像马尼拉条约组织那样的军事集团；反对企图把柬埔寨变为军事基地的美国—柬埔寨军事“援助”协定；反对帝国主义以及追随它的党派破坏日内瓦协定和和平共处的五项原则的阴谋。声明最后号召柬埔寨各阶层人民团结一致，同“人民派”一起为上述的斗争目标而奋斗。
