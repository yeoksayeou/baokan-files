Prepare Marketable Goods to Ensure Supply in Rural Areas During the Peak Season
	Xin Lu
The autumn peak season will soon arrive, and the rural market will gradually become active. Due to the good harvest this year, the state's unified purchase and procurement plans are more advanced and centralized than last year. During the peak season, farmers' purchasing power will definitely be higher than in previous years, and the needs of the rural market will definitely be greater. In order to meet the demands of farmers to buy industrial and handicraft products after selling agricultural products, support the state's procurement of agricultural and sideline products, and stabilize commodity prices in the rural market, commercial departments must immediately strengthen the preparation of marketable goods for this year's peak season.

Judging from the current inventory of commodities in the socialist commercial sector and the sources of goods that can be organized in the second half of the year, most commodities are relatively abundant. This year, the leading position of state-owned and cooperative commerce in the rural market has been further consolidated, and the leadership has been strengthened. Wholesale work has been improved compared to the past, especially the cooperatives have launched wholesale work in rural areas and strengthened the organization, leadership, and transformation of private merchants and peddlers. Most private merchants and peddlers have united around the cooperatives. In addition, the preparations for this year's peak season started earlier than last year, and there has been sufficient material preparation. This has created several favorable conditions for the rural supply work during this year's peak season. However, there are still many difficulties: first, the production of some major commodities has not increased much this year, and although the situation of short supply of some commodities has eased, the short supply of other commodities has developed slightly; second, the variety, specifications, colors, quality, and prices of some industrial products are not fully suitable for the needs of rural areas. Therefore, some available commodities cannot fully play the role of meeting needs, supporting procurement, and withdrawing currency; third, the current urban and rural wholesale work cannot fully meet the requirements of rational and meticulous distribution of commodities. Therefore, it is possible to increase the difficulty of supply due to improper distribution and scheduling, affecting the smooth completion of the supply task. It can be seen that doing a good job in rural supply during this year's peak season is not an easy task. Only if all commercial staff, under the leadership of party and government at all levels, redouble their efforts and seize all preparations, will it be possible to overcome difficulties, ensure the supply in rural areas, and activate and stabilize the rural market during the peak season.

In order to mobilize everyone to do a good job in preparing for the peak season, it is necessary to strengthen political and ideological education among all commercial staff, explain the situation and problems facing this year's peak season, and require that preparations be strengthened according to a bumper harvest or a normal to slightly better year. Explain the favorable conditions for completing the task and the arduousness of the work, organize everyone to study policies, especially to understand and master the specific policies and measures for various commodities, and then formulate action plans for their own regions in light of local characteristics, organize and equip forces, and take active action as soon as possible.

The central link for state-owned and cooperative commercial operating departments to prepare for the peak season is to prepare goods, especially marketable goods. To this end, the work should be carried out in the following three aspects:

	I. It is necessary to carefully conduct a warehouse inventory to classify goods. Carefully count the goods, find out the variety, specifications, colors, quality, and quantity of the inventory, and then propose treatment methods according to the three situations of marketable goods: appropriate amount, too much, and insufficient, as well as several categories such as slow-moving goods, defective goods, and unsalable goods. For marketable goods that are insufficient, actively organize the purchase of goods; for marketable goods that are too much, regionally slow-moving goods, and unsalable goods, propose to the superior business departments to find ways to transfer them out; for damaged and outdated goods, propose price reduction methods and organize sales after approval from the superior. II. It is necessary to rationally organize the transfer and distribution of goods. Through supply conferences and materials exchange meetings, organize the transfer of inventory goods that are overstocked in one place and insufficient in another; the marketable goods of the wholesale station should be actively organized for distribution, but the method of displaying samples to organize the selection of goods should be adopted, and the previous method of blind distribution and rigid allocation should be canceled, striving to make the goods suitable; the blindness of the operating unit in ordering goods should be overcome step by step from the ideological and work aspects, striving to make the order plan meet the actual needs. III. It is necessary to organize the transportation and storage of goods. The period before the peak season is the season of rain and wind, and the beginning of the peak season is the season of busy transportation of grain, coal, and other materials. Therefore, at present, we should do everything possible to organize the transportation of goods for the peak season in advance. After the materials are distributed to small and medium-sized cities and rural market towns, due to different climate and storage conditions, we must greatly strengthen the storage work to avoid losses.

In order to make the allocation and supply of goods for the peak season timely and appropriate, it is necessary to rectify the organization and system. First, the internal organization and division of labor of provincial wholesale stations should be rectified and improved, procedures and systems should be simplified, the strength of business personnel should be enriched, and the connection between wholesale stations and stores should be improved, striving to meet the needs of commodity distribution. Second, the wholesale institutions of county-level and grassroots cooperatives should be strengthened and rectified, and their internal organizational system should be improved. The wholesale division of labor of county stores and county cooperatives and the wholesale work for private merchants must be improved so that goods can be reasonably transported to retail institutions to meet consumers directly. In order to ensure the smooth implementation of various preparatory tasks, the superior commercial administrative departments, the superior cooperative federations, and the management departments of state-owned commercial enterprises must strengthen the supervision and inspection of the preparatory work, and promptly discover problems and correct shortcomings, which has a significant impact on the quality of the preparatory work.

In order to do a good job in the supply of rural areas during this year's peak season, we should also summarize last year's experience as a basis for improving and enhancing our work. According to last year's experience, the following points should be noted in this year's peak season supply work:

	I. It is necessary to correctly estimate the people's purchasing power and its composition during the peak season, and prevent blindness in material preparation due to inaccurate estimates. Last year, some provinces underestimated the local disaster situation and overestimated the purchasing power. They also lacked specific analysis of the composition of purchasing power. In order to make up for the difference between purchasing power and the available amount of materials, many industrial products were blindly organized to go to the countryside without selection, resulting in many goods being unsuitable and causing overstocking. At the same time, some areas underestimated purchasing power, resulting in insufficient material preparation and stockouts. This year, we should learn from these lessons and avoid carelessness and deviations.

	II. It is necessary to correctly grasp different supply principles and methods according to the commodity situation. In the early stages of the peak season last year, it was found that many areas lacked a correct understanding of the short supply of commodities, thinking that the less sold, the better. This led to conservative and reluctant sales ideas and bureaucratic work styles in supply. Some commodities were slightly insufficient, and planned supply and control sales were arbitrarily adopted, which further intensified the tension in the rural market. This year, for commodities in short supply, we must emphasize doing a good job in supply and oppose conservative and reluctant sales and the practice of reserving mobile quantities at each level. Planned supply must be implemented in accordance with the laws and regulations uniformly stipulated by the state. Control sales of commodities should also be handled in accordance with uniform policies and measures, and regulations should not be arbitrarily set. Commodities for which there are no uniform regulations must be actively supplied according to the plan, and control should not be arbitrarily added for fear of stockouts. For commodities with basically balanced supply and sales, we must emphasize actively completing the sales plan, and if the source of goods is guaranteed, we should try to exceed the plan as much as possible. For commodities that have no difficulties in production and raw materials and have relatively abundant inventory, we should vigorously promote sales and create conditions for expanding sales in terms of promotion methods and prices. The above principles are basically consistent with last year, but this year has undergone some changes in commodity content compared to last year. For example, cement and soda ash were insufficient last year, but this year they need to be vigorously promoted to complete the plan. For this reason, it is essential that commercial staff at all levels understand the policies and measures for various specific commodities.

	III. Strive for marketable commodities and prevent the occurrence of unsuitable goods and major blockages and minor stoppages. During the peak season last year, there was a common phenomenon in rural areas of insufficient supply of some scattered commodities and some commodities that could be supplied were not completely suitable for the needs of farmers. This situation has not been fundamentally improved in the first half of this year. This year, we must strive to do a good job in ordering plans from bottom to top, and organize the purchase of goods according to local actual needs to reduce blindness. Wholesale stations should also strive to allocate goods reasonably and appropriately. For scattered commodities that wholesale stations cannot supply or supply insufficiently, they should approve each county to control a certain amount of mobile procurement funds and allow them to conduct procurement in nearby cities with leadership and management.

	IV. Resolutely implement the principle of "prioritizing the supply of industrial products needed by both urban and rural areas to rural areas" and pay attention to implementing the principle of "prioritizing the supply of agricultural and sideline products to large and medium-sized cities, industrial and mining areas, and exports," and appropriately take care of the supply of non-staple foods in rural areas. Last year, the aspect of prioritizing the supply of industrial products to rural areas was generally implemented, but the implementation was not very thorough. Some commodities needed by both urban and rural areas were still distributed slightly more to large and medium-sized cities. Based on last year's experience, in addition to requiring wholesale stations to correctly grasp the allocation, we must also pay attention to persuading and mobilizing urban companies to squeeze out as many marketable goods as possible for rural areas. Especially for some municipal companies that directly control processing orders and are responsible for wholesale and arranging private merchants, it is not easy to implement the principle of "prioritizing supply to rural areas" unless they squeeze out goods with leadership. Last year, the priority supply of non-staple foods to cities and industrial and mining areas was well implemented, and this year it should continue to be implemented. However, in the arrangement of plans and business control last year, some commodities did not pay enough attention to appropriately taking care of rural areas, and it is necessary to improve this situation during the peak season this year.

	V. We must further improve the combination between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, correctly and appropriately arrange the rural market, and implement the policies of utilization, restriction, and transformation of rural private merchants and peddlers. Last year, due to the rapid advance of socialist commerce, there was a lack of arrangements for private commerce, resulting in the phenomenon of "cooperatives being busy to death, private merchants being idle to death, and the masses waiting to death" during the peak season. After the cooperatives arranged and transformed rural private merchants and peddlers in the first half of this year, the situation has changed greatly, which is more favorable for this year's peak season supply. However, in order to seriously do a good job in the rural peak season supply, further strengthen the grassroots wholesale work of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, and fully utilize the power of small merchants and peddlers to make them serve the peak season supply is still very important. State-owned commerce should specifically and thoroughly assist cooperatives in doing a good job in commodity preparation and supply organization, and assist grassroots cooperatives in contacting banks to avoid affecting the purchase of goods by grassroots cooperatives due to funding difficulties in continuing to implement the cessation of commercial credit (sales on credit, installment payments, etc.). When strengthening the combination of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, it is necessary to pay good attention to the consistent planning and arrangement of commodity management division of labor with counties as the unit in the peak season preparation work.

    准备适销商品，保证旺季农村供应
    新路
    秋后旺季不久即将来临，农村市场就要逐渐活跃起来。由于今年的年景较好，国家统购和收购计划比去年更加提前和集中，在旺季中农民的购买力一定会比往年高，农村市场的需要一定会比往年多。为了满足农民出售农产品后买进工业品和手工业品的要求，支持国家对农副产品的采购，稳定农村市场的物价，商业部门必须立即加强今年旺季适销商品的准备工作。
    根据目前社会主义商业部门库存的商品和下半年可以组织到手的货源来看，多数商品是比较充裕的。今年国营和合作社营商业在农村市场的领导地位已更加巩固，领导力量已加强；批发工作已较前改进，特别是合作社已经在农村展开了批发工作，并加强了对私商小贩的组织领导和改造工作，私商小贩多已团结在合作社周围；加以今年旺季准备工作动手比去年早，物资上已经有了充分准备，这就给今年旺季的农村供应工作造成了若干有利条件。但是，当前依然有不少困难：首先是若干主要商品今年增加生产不多，某些商品供不应求的情况虽有缓和，但另一些商品供不应求的情况还稍有发展；其次是某些工业品的品种、规格、花色、质量、价格还不完全适合农村的需要，因此部分可供应的商品并不能充分发挥满足需要、支持采购和回笼货币的作用；再次是目前城乡批发工作还不能完全适应合理细致分配商品的要求，因此就有可能由于分配调度不当而增加供应上的困难，影响供应任务不能顺利完成。由此可见，要做好今年旺季的农村供应工作，并不是一件轻而易举的事，只有全体商业工作人员在各级党政领导下加倍努力，抓紧一切准备工作，才有可能克服困难，保证农村的供应，活跃并稳定旺季的农村市场。
    为了动员大家做好旺季的准备工作，必须在全体商业工作人员中加强政治思想教育，说明今年面临的旺季的情况和问题，要求能按丰收或正常偏好年景来加强准备工作，说明完成任务的有利条件和工作的艰巨性，组织大家学习政策，特别是了解和掌握各种商品的具体政策和措施，然后针对当地特点切实制定好自己地区的行动计划，组织和配备好力量，从速积极行动起来。
    国营和合作社商业经营部门做好旺季准备的中心环节是准备好商品，特别是准备好适销商品。为此要从下列三方面来进行工作：
    一、必须认真地对库存商品进行清仓排队，要仔细清点商品，弄清库存的品种、规格、花色、质量和数量，然后按适销商品的适量、过多、不足三种情况及冷背商品、残次商品、根本不能销商品等数类，分别提出处理办法：对适销而不足的商品要积极组织进货；对适销而过多及地区性冷背商品、不能销商品等应提请上级业务部门设法向外调剂；对残损及过时商品则应提出削价处理办法，提请上级批准后组织销售。二、必须合理组织商品的调剂分配工作。通过供应会及物资交流会等形式，组织调剂在此处积压彼处不足的库存商品；批发站的适销商品要积极组织下放，但要采用陈列货样组织选货方法进行分配，取消以往盲目分配和硬性搭配的办法，力求商品对路；对经营单位要货的盲目性应从思想上工作上设法帮助逐步克服，力求要货计划能切合实际需要。三、必须组织好商品的调运和保管工作。旺季前正是多雨、多风的季节，旺季开始则正是粮食、煤炭等物资调运繁忙的季节，因此目前就应尽一切可能事先组织好旺季供应商品的调运工作；在物资下放到中小城市和农村集镇以后，由于气候和仓储条件的不同，必须大大加强保管工作，以避免发生损失。
    为了使旺季商品的分拨和供应工作做得及时对路，必须在组织上和制度上进行整顿。首先应该整顿和改进省级批发站的内部组织和分工，简化手续制度，充实业务人员的力量，搞好批发站同商店之间的联系，力求适应商品分配方面的需要；其次应加强和整顿县级及基层社的批发机构并改进其内部组织制度，县商店、县社的批发分工和对私商的批发工作均须改进，以便商品合理地输送到零售机构，直接同消费者见面。为使各项准备工作能完满执行，上级商业行政部门、上级合作社联社和国营商业企业的管理部门，必须加强对准备工作的督促检查，及时发现问题纠正缺点，这对于准备工作的好坏有重大的作用。
    为了做好今年旺季农村的供应工作，还应当总结去年的经验，作为改进提高工作的依据。根据去年的经验，今年旺季供应工作应该注意如下各点：
    一、必须正确估计旺季人民购买力及其构成，防止因估算不确而造成物资准备的盲目性。去年某些省份曾因对当地灾情估计不足、购买力估算偏高，对于购买力构成又缺乏具体分析，为了弥补购买力同物资可供量之间的差额，曾无选择地盲目地组织了许多工业品下乡，以致使许多商品货不对路造成积压；同时也有某些地区曾把购买力估计偏低，以致物资准备不足发生脱销。今年应该接受这些教训，避免粗枝大叶，发生偏差。
    二、必须分别商品情况，正确掌握不同的供应原则和供应方法。去年旺季初期曾发现不少地区由于对商品供不应求缺乏正确的认识，以为愈少卖愈好，产生保守惜售思想和供应上的官僚主义作风，某些商品稍显不足即任意采取计划供应和掌握出售，曾促使农村市场更形紧张。今年对于供不应求的商品，必须强调做好供应工作，反对保守惜售和层层留机动量的作法。计划供应必须按国家统一规定的法令执行；掌握出售商品也应根据统一的政策措施办理，不得随便乱定规章；没有统一规定的商品必须按计划积极供应，不得怕脱销而乱加控制。对于供销大体平衡的商品，要强调积极完成销售计划，只要货源有把握，还应尽可能争取超过计划。对于生产和原料无困难而库存比较充裕的商品，则应大力推销，从推销方法及价格上创造扩大推销的条件。以上原则同去年基本上是一致的，但今年同去年在商品内容上则已起了若干变化，如水泥、纯碱等去年曾经不足，今年则须要大力推销才能完成计划。为此，使各级商业工作人员都能了解各种具体商品的政策措施，是十分必要的。
    三、力求商品适销，防止发生货不对路和大通小塞现象。去年旺季，农村中普遍有着若干零星商品供应不足和某些能供应的商品不完全适合农民需要的现象，这种状况到今年上半年还没有根本改善。今年必须力求自下而上做好要货计划，根据当地实际需要组织进货，以减少盲目性。批发站分配商品也应力求合理对路，对于批发站不能供应和供应不足的零星商品，应批准各县掌握一定数量的机动采购资金，允许到附近城市有领导有管理地进行采购。
    四、切实贯彻“城乡都需要的工业品优先供应农村”和注意贯彻“农副产品优先供应大中城市、工矿区和出口”的原则，适当照顾农村副食品的供应。去年工业品优先供应农村方面是大致贯彻了，但执行得还不很彻底，某些城乡都需要的商品，大中城市依然分配得稍多。根据去年经验，除要求批发站分配时正确掌握外，还必须注意说服动员城市公司，把适销商品尽量匀挤给农村，特别某些市公司在直接掌握加工订货、并负责批发和安排私商的情况下，如不是有领导地匀挤，要贯彻“优先供应农村”的原则是不容易的。去年在副食品优先供应城市和工矿区方面执行得很好，今年应继续贯彻。但去年在计划的安排和业务掌握上，有的商品对适当照顾农村方面还注意不够，今年旺季有必要改进这一情况。
    五、必须进一步搞好国营商业和合作社营商业之间的结合，正确地适当地安排农村市场，贯彻对农村私商小贩的利用、限制和改造政策。去年由于社会主义商业前进过快，对私营商业缺乏安排，以致旺季发生“合作社忙死、私商闲死、群众等死”的现象；今年上半年合作社对农村私商小贩进行了安排和改造后，情况有很大改变，这对今年旺季供应是较为有利的。但为了认真搞好农村旺季供应，进一步加强国营商业和合作社营的基层批发工作，充分利用小商小贩力量，使他们为旺季供应服务，还是很重要的。国营商业要具体深入协助合作社搞好商品准备工作和供应组织工作，协助基层社同银行搞好联系，以免在继续贯彻停止商业信用（赊销、期款等）中，基层社因资金困难而影响进货。在加强国营商业同合作社营商业的结合时，对于以县为单位的计划衔接一致并安排好商品经营的分工，在旺季准备工作中尤应很好地注意。
