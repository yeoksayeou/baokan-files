To the Editor:

　　We are employees of the Third Transportation Brigade of the Yumen Mining Bureau's Transportation Department. In May and June of this year, we undertook the transportation task of supplying materials needed for the Qaidam Basin, supporting the geological workers in their search for underground treasures.

　　In over a month, we transported hundreds of tons of materials twice from Wuwei, Gansu, through the Hexi Corridor, to Mangyai in the Qaidam Basin. This route is more than 1,500 kilometers long, and from Dunhuang to the Qaidam Basin, it passes through hundreds of kilometers of the Gobi Desert and rarely visited deep mountains and ridges. In the Gobi Desert, sometimes the vehicles encountered quicksand and sank deeper and deeper; we had to shovel quicksand and lay wooden planks to barely get the vehicles to climb up. On Jin Hong Mountain, at an altitude of more than 3,000 meters where Qinghai, Gansu, and Xinjiang provinces meet, the road was narrow and winding, with steep cliffs on one side and a deep abyss on the other. When the cars climbed up the mountain, assistants had to run behind the cars with chocks to prevent the wheels from slipping. Our lives were also very difficult. We had to bring our own food, drink, and bedding. We ate a few dry steamed buns a day, and sometimes we couldn't even get water to drink in the desert. At night, we slept in the open on the grasslands or in the Gobi Desert... Under such circumstances, we successfully completed the transportation task and ensured safe driving.

　　After we arrived in Mangyai in the Qaidam Basin, the comrades of the Qinghai Geological Exploration Bureau welcomed us like relatives and introduced us to many inspiring situations. The Qaidam Basin is truly a treasure trove of the motherland. The minerals here, according to what has already been discovered, include more than twenty kinds, such as oil, gold, silver, copper, iron, coal, salt, alkali, borax, and gypsum. In particular, the oil reserves are very rich. In the Qaidam Basin, we saw that the ground in many places was covered with earth wax like asphalt, and there were also some shiny black oil seedling hills. A slight dig would emit a strong smell of oil; in Yusha Mountain, you could pick up the oil sand on the ground and use it to make a fire. These things really made us feel indescribably excited and happy. In order to develop this virgin land, geological workers are waging a tenacious struggle against many difficulties in nature. All day long, they ride camels, carry instruments and food, and work in valleys, grasslands, and deserts, braving the drastically changing climate and sandstorms. In the summer in the basin, weeds grow and mosquitoes are very numerous. The geological personnel wear masks and gloves, enduring the uncomfortable heat and working patiently. In such a harsh environment, many geological exploration teams have overfulfilled their tasks every month. Compared to those who are searching for treasures for the motherland, we feel that the difficulties in our work can be completely overcome. We are determined to do our work well, transporting all kinds of equipment and supplies to Qaidam to support them.

### 支援柴达木盆地的地质勘探工作

　　支援柴达木盆地的地质勘探工作编辑同志：
    我们是玉门矿务局运输处第三运输大队的职工。今年五、六月间，我们担任了供应柴达木盆地物资需要的运输任务，来支援地质工作人员寻找地下的宝藏。
    在一个多月的时间内，我们两次把几百吨的物资从甘肃武威，经过河西走廊运到柴达木盆地的茫涯。这条道路长达一千五百多公里，从敦煌到柴达木盆地要经过数百公里的戈壁滩和人迹罕到的深山峻岭。在戈壁滩上，有时车子碰到了流沙，越陷越深；要一面铲流沙一面铺木板，才能使车子勉强爬上来。在青海、甘肃、新疆三省交界处拔海三千多公尺的金鸿山上，公路狭窄而弯曲，路旁一边是陡峭的山壁，一边是万丈深沟，汽车向山上爬时，助手们都要拿着掩木跟在汽车后面跑，防备车轮子打滑。我们的生活也是十分艰苦的，路上吃的、喝的和住宿用具都要自己带，一天吃上几个干馒头，有时在沙漠中还喝不上水，夜里就露宿在草原或戈壁滩上……。就在这样的情况下，我们胜利地完成了运输任务，并且保证了安全行车。
    我们到柴达木盆地的茫涯以后，青海地质勘探局的同志们像对待亲人一样地欢迎我们，并向我们介绍了许多振奋人心的情况。柴达木盆地真是祖国的一个聚宝盆，这里蕴藏的矿藏，据已经发现的就有石油、金、银、铜、铁、煤、盐、碱、硼砂、石膏等二十多种，特别是石油藏量非常丰富。我们在柴达木盆地，看见许多地方的地面铺着像沥青一样的地蜡，还有些黑得发亮的油苗小山，稍微挖一下就散发出浓郁的石油味来；在油沙山，拿起地上的油沙就可以烧火。这些真使我们感到说不出来的兴奋和愉快。为了开发这块处女地，地质工作人员们正在同自然界的许多困难进行顽强的斗争。他们整天骑着骆驼、背着仪器和吃的东西，在山谷里、草原上和沙漠中，冒着寒暑变化剧烈的气候和风沙进行工作。盆地里的夏天，水草丛生，蚊子非常多，地质人员们都带上面罩、手套，忍受着难过的闷热，耐心地工作着。就在这样艰苦的环境中，许多地质勘探队每月都超额完成了任务。比起那些为祖国寻找宝藏的人们来，我们就感到我们工作中的困难是完全可以克服的。我们决心做好工作，把各种器材、生活用品等运到柴达木去，来支援他们。
