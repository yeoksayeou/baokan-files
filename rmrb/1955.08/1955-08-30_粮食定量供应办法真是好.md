　　The Grain Rationing System is Really Good
　　Quan Pingzhou
　　I am a resident of Baishulin Street in Beilin District, Xi'an City, and serve as the director of the residents' committee. The state's decision to implement the grain rationing system in towns and cities this time is correct, reasonable, and meets actual needs.
　　In the past, the urban grain supply was too high, and grain waste was very serious. Taking the situation in our Baishulin Street as an example, it was common to see leftover food poured into the dirty sewers. Many families threw away whole steamed buns haphazardly. This was mainly because the grain supply was generous, and residents didn't bother to save. They didn't plan carefully when cooking, and if they made too much, there would be leftovers. Despite inspections and rectifications, the originally verified grain supply was still not completely consumed. For example, the grain supplied during the three months from May to July this year, calculated per capita for the entire street, averaged 27 jin and 11 liang per person per month, but in reality, each person only ate an average of 23 jin and 11 liang per month. The verified quota for resident Yin Lizai's family was 264 jin per month, but they actually ate an average of only 171 jin per month, with the surplus grain accounting for about one-third of the verified supply.
　　On the other hand, due to shortcomings and loopholes in the supply work, some people were able to exploit them. For example, in our street, one family had a child who went to the countryside in early February this year, and the grain has not been canceled to this day. Another family reported grain for three people, but actually four people were eating the grain. Because the supply was too high, there was still enough grain to eat. Now, with the implementation of the "grading by person, rationing by grade, issuing certificates by household, and purchasing grain with certificates" supply method, the supply is now reasonable! I guarantee to do a good job of publicizing this to the masses, so that this policy can be smoothly implemented.
　　When we first started publicizing, many people were worried that the quantity supplied according to the new standards would not be enough to eat. However, after some people personally experimented and held discussions in residents' meetings, calculating carefully, and overcoming waste, it was proven that the quantity supplied according to the new standards was not only enough to eat but also had some surplus. Resident Wu Xueyan, with a family of five, big and small, can save 20 jin of grain per month, besides guaranteeing good meals, under the principle of thrift. From the perspective of the original actual grain consumption of some families, the quantity supplied according to the new standards is still more than enough. Resident Yin Lizai's family of nine, big and small, is supplied with 195.5 jin per month according to the new standards; but his family ate only an average of 171 jin per month in May, June, and July. Based on this calculation, they can now save 24.5 jin per month. If they calculate more carefully, they can save even more grain.
　　Now, the masses in our streets and lanes mostly recognize the benefits of the "rationing" method for the country and themselves. Everyone is actively calculating carefully, making savings plans, and expressing warm support for this new measure.
　　In addition, we must also recognize that the "rationing" method of grain is beneficial to the country and the people, but of course, it is unfavorable to the bad elements and counter-revolutionaries who still attempt to exploit loopholes for speculation and profiteering. They will definitely spread rumors and sabotage. Therefore, we must also be vigilant, expose rumors at any time, and fight against all thoughts and behaviors that undermine the grain policy.

### 粮食定量供应办法真是好

　　粮食定量供应办法真是好
　　权平舟
    我是西安市碑林区柏树林街的居民，担任居民委员会的主任。这次国家决定实行市镇粮食定量供应办法，我感到这个办法是正确合理的，是切合实际需要的。
    过去，城市粮食供应量是偏高的，浪费粮食的现象也是很严重的。拿我们柏树林街的情况来说，经常可以看到脏水道里有倒进去的剩饭。不少家庭整块的蒸馍乱丢乱撂。这主要是因为粮食供应量宽，居民们也不想办法节约，做饭时不精打细算，做多了吃不完就剩下。尽管经过检查整顿，原来核实供应的粮食还是吃不完的。如今年五月至七月这三个月供应的粮食，按全街的人口计算，每人每月平均二十七斤十一两，但实际上每人每月平均只吃了二十三斤十一两。如居民殷立哉全家核实定量每月为二百六十四斤，实际平均每月只吃了一百七十一斤，节余的粮食占核实供应量的三分之一左右。
    另一方面，由于供应工作有缺点、有漏洞，也给一些人留下了空子。像我们街有一家居民，一个小孩今年二月初就下了乡，直到现在还没有消粮。又有一家报了三口人的粮，实际吃粮的人是四口，由于供应量偏高，粮食也够吃了。现在实行“按人分等，以等定量，按户发证，凭证购粮”的供应办法，这一下供应就合理啦！我保证要向群众做好宣传工作，使这一个政策顺利地贯彻实行。
    开始宣传的时候，很多群众怕按新标准供应的数量不够吃。可是有些人经过亲自试验和居民会座谈讨论，精打细算，克服浪费，证明按新标准供应的数量不但够吃，而且还有些余头。居民伍雪艳，他家大小五口人，在节约的原则下，每月除了保证吃好以外，还可以节余二十斤粮食。有些家庭从原来实际吃粮的情况来看，按新标准供给的数量也还是绰绰有余的。居民殷立哉全家大小九口人，按新标准每月供应量是一百九十五斤半；但他家在五、六、七三个月中，平均每月只吃一百七十一斤。这样算下来，现在每月还可以余二十四斤半。如果再精打细算一下，还能节余更多的粮食。
    现在，我们街巷的群众，大都认识了“定量供应”办法对国家对自己的好处，大家都积极地进行精打细算，订节约计划，对这一新的措施表示热烈拥护。
    另外，我们还要认识到：粮食“定量供应”的办法，对国家对人民是有利的，对于还企图继续钻空子进行投机倒把的坏分子和反革命分子来说当然是不利的，他们一定会进行造谣破坏。因此，我们还要提高警惕，随时揭发谣言，同一切破坏粮食政策的思想和行为作斗争。
