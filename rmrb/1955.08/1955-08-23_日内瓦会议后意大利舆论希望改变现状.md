　　Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd, Moscow Dispatch: "Pravda" published an article by its Rome correspondent, V. Yermakov. Based on the comments in Italian newspapers, the author analyzes the social sentiments in Italy after the Geneva Conference.
    The author points out that many newspapers, in their commentaries, emphasized that the Geneva Conference made a significant contribution to consolidating peace and the security of all countries. Official spokesmen of the Italian government also welcomed the results of the Geneva Conference. At the same time, Italian newspapers began to advocate that Italy should actively participate in solving important issues such as disarmament and the establishment of a European collective security system. Italian newspapers also raised other international issues. For example, "Il Popolo," the organ of the Christian Democratic Party, said that there should be no discrimination in the issue of admitting many countries to the United Nations. The Italian government's statement expressing its willingness to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China has also attracted the attention of Italian newspapers.
    The author points out that now, public opinion hopes to find a foreign policy direction that can conform to Italy's interests and the aspirations of millions of Italians. The so-called theory of "equidistance," proposed and supported by influential political forces, has become very popular. This theory means that Italy should maintain "equidistance" from mutually opposed blocs. According to those who support this theory, this position of Italy is in line with its national interests, and taking this position will bring many benefits to the country.
    A widespread view among right-wing figures is that Italy should implement a more independent policy within the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or the Western European Union, in order to satisfy some of the demands made by bourgeois figures regarding Italy's national prestige and Italy's traditional ties with Near Eastern countries, Latin American countries, etc. Such demands have also been made among Christian Democrats.
    The author says that all this shows that people from all walks of life in Italian society hope to change the status quo, and hope to make Italy's foreign policy a tool for bringing Italy closer to other countries in accordance with the national interests of the Italian people.

　　日内瓦会议后意大利舆论希望改变现状
    新华社二十二日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科二十二日讯：“真理报”发表了它的驻罗马记者维·叶尔马科夫的一篇文章。作者根据意大利报纸的言论，分析日内瓦会议以后意大利的社会情绪。
    作者指出：许多报纸都在评论里强调日内瓦会议对巩固和平和各国安全作了重大贡献，意大利政府的官方发言人也欢迎日内瓦会议的结果。同时，意大利报纸开始主张意大利要积极参与解决裁减军备和建立欧洲集体安全体系这些重要问题。意大利报纸还提出了其他国际问题。例如，天主教民主党机关报“人民报”说：在接纳许多国家加入联合国的问题上，不应该有歧视。意大利政府关于愿意同中华人民共和国建立外交关系的声明也引起了意大利报纸的注意。
    作者指出：现在，舆论希望找出一条能够符合意大利的利益、符合千千万万意大利人的愿望的外交政策方针。有很大影响的政治势力提出和支持的所谓“等距离”的理论，成为十分流行的了。这种理论就是说，意大利应该对互相对立的集团保持“等距离”。据拥护这个理论的人说，意大利的这种立场是符合本国的民族利益的，而且，采取这种立场会给国家带来许多好处。
    在右派人物中广泛流行这样一种意见：意大利在北大西洋公约或是西欧联盟的范围内应该实行比较独立的政策，以便满足资产阶级人士在意大利的国家威信方面以及在意大利同近东国家、拉丁美洲国家等的传统联系方面提出的一些要求。在天主教民主党人中也提出了这种要求。
    作者说：这一切都说明：意大利社会各界人士都希望改变现状，希望使意大利的外交政策成为按照意大利人民的民族利益使意大利同其他国家相接近的工具。
