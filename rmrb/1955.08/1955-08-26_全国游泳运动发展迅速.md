　　When the 1955 National Swimming Competition was being held, the person in charge of the organizing committee told our reporter about the development of the national swimming movement in recent years. He said: After the national liberation, many cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, Guangzhou have newly built and renovated swimming pools. In 1951, the People's Swimming Pool, including four pools with a total of more than 39,000 square meters, was built near Shichahai in Beijing. Since Tianjin's liberation, three new swimming pools have been built, including the Water Park Swimming Pool newly built this year, which can accommodate 3,000 people swimming at the same time. The Youth Swimming Pool newly built in Guangzhou this year includes seven huge swimming pools, two of which are shallow pools built using the beach. These seven pools can accommodate 30,000 people swimming every day.
　　With the large expansion of swimming venues, mass swimming activities across the country have developed greatly. From the southern coastal provinces with swimming traditions to the Songhua River and Heilongjiang River basins in the Northeast, the number of swimming enthusiasts in various cities and villages is increasing day by day. The number of people in Beijing who hold physical examination certificates for swimming has increased from 60,000 in 1951 to 220,000 this year.
　　At present, many provinces and cities across the country regularly hold provincial and city-wide swimming competitions every year. Some cities have also held swimming knowledge lectures and amateur swimming training classes. New young swimmers continue to emerge. The swimming achievements of Huang Mancui, 14 years old, and Fu Cuirong, 12 years old, from Fujian Province, have both reached the excellent level of the province.
　　The technical level of my country's swimmers is rapidly improving. This July, at the swimming competition of ten cities held in Sichuan Province, 17 of the 18 competition events broke the highest record in the Southwest region. At present, from a national perspective, all swimming events have broken the highest records before liberation. Among them, many events such as men's 100-meter breaststroke, butterfly, backstroke, freestyle, as well as 200-meter breaststroke and 400-meter medley relay, have reached or are close to international levels. In diving and water polo, athletes' skills have also improved significantly. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　全国游泳运动发展迅速
    当一九五五年全国游泳竞赛大会正在举行时，大会筹备处负责人对本社记者谈到近年来全国游泳运动发展的情况。他说：全国解放后，北京、天津、上海、广州等许多城市都新建和修建了游泳池。一九五一年，在北京市什刹海附近修建了包括四个池子共有三万九千多平方公尺的人民游泳场。天津市解放后已新建了三处游泳场，其中今年新建的水上公园游泳场，可以同时容纳三千人游泳。广州市今年新建的青年游泳场，包括七个巨大的游泳池，其中两个是利用海滩建成的浅水池。这七个池每天可容三万人游泳。
    随着游泳场地的大量扩展，全国群众性的游泳活动已有很大的开展。从有游泳传统的南方沿海各省到东北的松花江、黑龙江流域，各个城市和乡村中游泳爱好者的人数正在日益增加。北京市持有游泳体格检查证参加游泳的人数已从一九五一年的六万人增加到今年的二十二万人。
    现在，全国许多省、市每年都定期举行全省、全市性的游泳竞赛大会。有的城市还举办了游泳知识讲座和业余游泳训练班。新的青年游泳运动员不断出现。福建省十四岁的黄曼翠和十二岁的傅翠蓉的游泳成绩，都已达到全省的优秀水平。
    我国游泳运动员的技术水平正在迅速提高。今年七月，四川省举行的十个城市游泳竞赛大会上，十八个竞赛项目中就有十七项打破了西南区的最高纪录。目前，从全国来说，所有的游泳项目都已打破了解放前的最高纪录。其中男子一百公尺蛙泳、蝶泳、仰泳、自由泳以及二百公尺蛙泳和四百公尺混合式接力等许多项目，都已达到或接近国际水平。在跳水、水球运动方面，运动员们的技巧也有了显著的提高。　（据新华社讯）
