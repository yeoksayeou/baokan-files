Liling County, a well-known high-yield double-season rice area in Hunan Province, has achieved another bumper harvest of early rice on more than 600,000 mu of double-season rice this year, with an average yield of about 400 jin of rice per mu. If the late rice does not encounter special disasters, the yield per unit area of double-season rice will exceed that of previous years. Before this, in 1952, 1953, and 1954, the average yield of double-season rice in the county exceeded 600 jin per mu, more than 20% higher than the highest level before liberation.

Liling County is located in the Xiangjiang River basin in eastern Hunan Province, with double-season rice accounting for 87% of the total rice paddy area. The county is basically a hilly area. According to investigations by relevant departments, the natural conditions such as climate, rainfall, and soil are not significantly different from other hilly areas in the province. But why can it achieve such stable and continuous bumper harvests?

The reporter interviewed relevant agricultural departments in Liling County and Hunan Province on this matter. It turns out that double-season rice has been planted here for more than 100 years. Before liberation, due to the exploitation and oppression of feudal landlords, farmers had weak economic power, insufficient fertilizer for double-season rice planting, and were often subjected to natural disasters such as drought and insects. The average yield per mu over the years was less than 500 jin, and in some cases, even only more than 100 jin. After liberation in 1949, the Liling County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Liling County People's Government carefully studied the county's production situation and first created conditions for increasing double-season rice production. In response to the characteristics of double-season rice having a long growing period and therefore requiring a lot of water and fertilizer, the party and government leading organs of Liling County led farmers to use streams and river water sources to vigorously build small-scale farmland water conservancy projects such as ponds, dams, and reservoirs, as well as planting green manure crops in the fields after harvesting late rice and changing winter fertilizer accumulation to year-round fertilizer accumulation. By 1954, due to the construction of water conservancy projects, the drought resistance capacity of rice paddies in the county had increased from 25 days in the early days of liberation to 45 days, basically guaranteeing the water needed for double-season rice. The planting of green manure crops has also become popular in most rice paddies, with yields generally reaching 2,000 to 3,000 jin per mu, and as high as 6,000 to 7,000 jin. This not only solved the fertilizer needed for early double-season rice but also improved the soil. The land fertility, which had been excessively consumed due to the planting of double-season rice, was cultivated.

Starting in 1952, the Liling County Party and government leading organs deeply summarized the farming experience of local farmers and, relying on mutual aid and cooperation organizations, carried out agricultural technology reform centered on "early" (advancing the harvest season of double-season rice) and "good" (increasing yield) on the basis of the original fine land preparation. Liling County has early cold weather in autumn, and late rice suffers from severe rice stem borer damage, so late rice production has been reduced significantly over the years. However, farmers have long had the experience of early planting and early harvesting, such as "early rice does not eat Qingming water" and "late rice does not pass autumn, and if it passes autumn, nine out of ten will not be harvested." At this time, with hundreds of mutual aid groups as the mainstay, early sowing, early transplanting, and early harvesting were vigorously promoted and popularized. Farmers also adopted more local early-maturing and high-yielding early and late rice varieties, as well as the method of applying "an dun hui" (a mixed fertilizer of human manure and plant ash, which is applied around the rice seedlings after transplanting to promote rice growth and advance the maturity period). As a result, the harvest period of the two seasons of rice was brought forward by about ten days compared to the past. In particular, the late rice was harvested before the autumn frost and before the peak of the third generation rice stem borer, avoiding and reducing disaster losses. At the same time, in response to the cultivation shortcomings such as dense sowing, shallow plowing, and insufficiently refined seed selection in most areas, the experience of Li Chenggui, a national rice production model, was specially summarized, and more than 1,000 people, including the county's agricultural labor models and mutual aid group leaders, were organized to study. Through study, more than 1,400 high-yield groups were established throughout the county, focusing on mutual aid groups, taking the lead in carrying out technical reforms such as deep plowing, close planting, and seed selection, and organizing surrounding farmers to visit. Due to the promotion of these experiences, coupled with the guarantee of water conservancy and fertilizer, double-season rice changed the past situation of low yields of late rice and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The average yield per mu in the county reached more than 620 jin. After a comprehensive summary of production increase, in 1953 and 1954, a complete set of production increase techniques such as improving rice paddies, deep plowing and close planting, good seedlings, reasonable fertilization, early sowing and early transplanting, pest control, and careful harvesting were further promoted. With the development of the agricultural collectivization movement, this year, in addition to the general implementation of early sowing, early transplanting, and the selection of early-maturing and high-yielding varieties for early rice throughout the county, about 90% of the rice paddies have implemented small-hill close planting, and actively prevented and controlled pests. After the bumper harvest of early rice, farmers in various places are stepping up the cultivation of late rice and striving for another bumper harvest.

　　双季稻连年丰收的醴陵县
　　新华社记者　马钟明
    著名双季稻高产区湖南省醴陵县，今年六十多万亩双季稻早稻又是普遍丰收，平均每亩约收稻谷四百斤左右。如果晚稻不遇特殊灾害，双季稻单位面积产量将超过往年。在此以前，一九五二年、一九五三年和一九五四年，全县双季稻每亩平均产量都在六百斤以上，超过解放前最高水平百分之二十多。
    醴陵县在湖南省东部湘江流域，双季稻占稻田总面积百分之八十七。全县基本上是丘陵地区，据有关部门调查，气候、雨量、土壤等自然条件和省内其他丘陵地区并无显著不同。但为什么能获得这种连年稳定的丰收呢？
    记者就此访问了醴陵县和湖南省有关农业部门。原来这里种植双季稻已经有一百多年的历史，解放前由于农民受封建地主剥削和压迫，经济力量薄弱，种植双季稻肥料不足，并常年遭受旱、虫等自然灾害侵袭，历年每亩平均产量连五百斤都不到，低的甚至只一百多斤。一九四九年解放后，中共醴陵县委员会和醴陵县人民政府仔细研究全县生产情况，首先设法为双季稻增产创造了条件。针对双季稻生长期长，因而水和肥料需要多的特点，醴陵县党、政领导机关便领导农民利用溪涧河流水源，大力修筑塘、坝和水库等小型农田水利工程，以及在收割晚稻后的田里种植绿肥作物和改冬季积肥为常年积肥。到一九五四年，因兴修水利工程，全县稻田抗旱能力由解放初期的二十五天提高到四十五天，基本上保证了双季稻所需的水；绿肥作物的种植也普及大部稻田，每亩产量一般都达二、三千斤，高的有六、七千斤，不但解决了双季稻早稻所需的肥料，而且改良了土壤，因种植双季稻而消耗过大的地力得到了培养。
      一九五二年起，醴陵县党、政领导机关深入总结当地农民的耕作经验，并依靠互助合作组织，在原来整地精细的基础上，开展了以“早”（提早双季稻的收获季节）和“好”（提高产量）为中心的农业技术改革工作。醴陵县秋季早寒，晚稻螟虫危害严重，因此历年晚稻减产很多。但农民中早有“早禾不吃清明水”、“晚禾不过秋，过秋九不收”的早插、早收经验。这时，便以几百个互助组为主，大力提倡和推广早播、早插、早收。农民还更多地采用了当地早熟高产的早稻和晚稻良种，以及追施安蔸灰的办法（一种人粪尿和草木灰的混合肥料，在插秧后分蔸施在禾蔸周围，促使稻禾发育，提早成熟期）。结果，两季水稻的收获期比过去提早了十来天，特别是晚稻在秋霜前和三化螟盛发期前收割，避免和减轻了灾害损失。与此同时，针对大部地区播种密、犁田浅、选种不够精细等耕作缺点，专门总结了全国水稻丰产模范李呈桂的增产经验，并组织了县的农业劳动模范、互助组长等一千多人进行学习。通过学习，全县先后以互助组为重点建立起一千四百多个丰产小组，带头进行深耕、密植、选种等技术改革，并组织周围农民参观。由于这些经验的推广，加上水利、肥料的保证，这
  一年双季稻改变了过去晚稻低产的情况，获得了空前的丰收，全县每亩平均产量达六百二十多斤。经过全面的增产总结，一九五三年和一九五四年进一步推广了改良稻田、深耕密植、良种壮秧、合理施肥、早播早插、防治虫害、细打细收等整套增产技术。随着农业合作化运动的发展，今年全县早稻除普遍实行早播、早插和选用早熟高产的品种外，约百分之九十以上的稻田实行了小蔸密植，并积极防治了虫害。各地农民在早稻丰收后，正加紧培育晚稻，争取再一次的丰收。
