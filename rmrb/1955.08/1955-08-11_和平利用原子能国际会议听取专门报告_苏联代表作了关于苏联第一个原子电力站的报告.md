Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, August 10th: The International Scientific and Technical Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy heard and discussed reports on specialized issues at its afternoon session on August 8th and its morning and afternoon sessions on August 9th.

    The afternoon session on August 8th discussed the world's need for energy resources. A United Nations report on the world's kinetic energy needs from 1975 to 2000 stated that by the end of the twentieth century, the world's annual kinetic energy needs would be eight times those of 1952. The report pointed out that in a peaceful environment, the need for effective kinetic energy might grow by 4 to 6 percent annually. This raised the issue of opening up the world's sources of kinetic energy.

    British scientists Robinson and Daniel pointed out in their reports that the use of nuclear energy to produce electricity is of particular significance because the natural sources of kinetic energy (coal, oil, and natural gas) are gradually being depleted and will eventually be unable to meet the world economy's growing need for energy resources.

    The morning session on August 9th discussed the establishment of atomic power equipment, particularly atomic power plants, and the prospects for utilizing atomic energy in these areas. The participants at the conference listened with great interest to the report by Soviet scientists Blokhintsev and Nikolaev on "The Soviet Union's First Industrial Atomic Power Plant and the Development Path of Atomic Power Engineering."

    The report stated that the Soviet Union's first industrial atomic power plant, with a generating capacity of 5,000 kilowatts, began generating electricity on June 27, 1954. Recognizing the great significance of the peaceful uses of atomic energy, the Soviet government strives to develop international cooperation in this area and has therefore decided to submit a report to the conference on the Soviet Union's first industrial atomic power plant and its operating conditions. One year of experience since the power plant started operation has shown that, under certain conditions, it is already economically advantageous to build atomic power plants with large generating capacities.

    Reporter Blokhintsev then introduced the construction, physical characteristics, and use of the Soviet industrial atomic power plant. He said that the Soviet Union's first atomic power plant had generated 15 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. During its entire period of operation, the heating elements had never malfunctioned, and the operation of all the automatic machinery in the power plant was satisfactory. The intensity of radiation in the water discharged from the interior of the power plant and the air discharged from the ventilation pipes did not threaten the safety of service personnel and surrounding residents. The operation and management of an atomic power plant is simpler than that of a coal-fired power plant.

    Blokhintsev said that the Soviet Union is currently designing various atomic power plants with generating capacities of 50,000 to 100,000 kilowatts and more than 100,000 kilowatts. These larger power plants have the potential to produce electricity at a cost of 10 to 20 kopecks per kilowatt-hour.

    Blokhintsev concluded by saying that international cooperation among scientists would have a very beneficial impact on the development of atomic power engineering, a new industrial sector.

    The conference held a lively discussion of Blokhintsev's report, during which the Soviet scientist answered a series of questions raised by representatives from Canada, the United States, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, India, and Argentina.

    British scientists Hill and Joslin's report discussed the funding required for the United Kingdom to begin implementing its atomic energy development plan.

    United States Atomic Energy Commission member Davis spoke in his report about the investment necessary to build an atomic power plant. According to Davis's calculations, the equipment for a power plant with a designed generating capacity of one kilowatt requires an investment of approximately $250.

    The afternoon session on August 9th discussed the economics of nuclear power, the role of thorium, and legal and administrative management issues.

    Rein (United States) and Yorks (United Kingdom) presented reports on "The Economics of Nuclear Power."

    British scientist Dewart gave a report on the role of thorium.

    Reports by Japanese scientist Suzue, British scientist Binks, and American scientist Taylor discussed the legal and administrative management of nuclear power, and the World Health Organization also issued a report on this issue. The World Health Organization's report pointed out that since the discovery of uranium fission, the problem of preventing radiation during work has become a major task in healthcare. From the perspective of the worldwide use of atomic energy, public health agencies should assume responsibility for solving the problem of radiation prevention.

### 和平利用原子能国际会议听取专门报告  苏联代表作了关于苏联第一个原子电力站的报告

    和平利用原子能国际会议听取专门报告
    苏联代表作了关于苏联第一个原子电力站的报告
    新华社十日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：和平利用原子能国际科学技术会议八日下午和九日上午、下午会议听取和讨论了关于专门问题的报告。
    八日下午会议讨论全世界对能力资源的需要问题。联合国提出的关于在一九七五年到二零零零年世界对动能的需要量的报告说明，到二十世纪末，世界每年对动能上的需要量将为一九五二年的八倍。报告指出，在和平的环境里，对有效动能的需要量每年可能增长百分之四到百分之六。这就提出了开辟世界的动能来源的问题。
    英国科学家罗宾逊和丹尼尔在报告中指出，利用核子能来生产电能具有特殊的意义，因为动能的天然来源（煤、石油和天然气体）的储藏在逐渐地消耗，并且以后将不能够满足世界经济对动能资源的日益增长的需要。
    九日上午会议讨论了关于建立原子动力设备、特别是原子能发电站以及在这些方面利用原子能的远景的问题。会议的参加者十分感兴趣地听取了苏联科学家布洛欣泽夫和尼古拉耶夫所作的关于“苏联第一个工业原子能发电站和原子能力学的发展途径”的报告。
    报告说，苏联第一个发电能力五千瓩的工业原子能发电站在一九五四年六月二十七日开始发电。苏联政府认识到和平利用原子能的重大意义，力求在这方面发展国际合作，因而决定向会议提出关于苏联第一个工业原子能发电站和它的工作情况的报告。发电站开工一年的经验表明，在一定的条件下，建设发电能力很大的原子能发电站，目前在经济上也已经是有利的。
    报告人布洛欣泽夫接着介绍了苏联工业原子电力站的构造、物理特点和使用情况。他说，苏联的第一个原子能发电站已经发电一千五百万瓩时，在它的整个工作期间发热元素从来没有出过毛病，发电站里的全部自动机械的工作情况是令人满意的。发电厂厂房内部所排出的水和通风管所排出的空气的放射线的强度并不威胁服务人员和周围居民的安全。原子能发电站的经营管理要比用煤的发电站为简便。
    布洛欣泽夫说，苏联目前正在设计发电能力五万到十万瓩以及十万瓩以上的各种原子能发电站，这种发电能力更大的发电站有可能生产每瓩时成本为十到二十戈比的电力。
    布洛欣泽夫最后说，科学家的国际合作会对原子能力学这个新工业部门的发展产生很有利的影响。
    会议对布洛欣泽夫的报告进行了热烈的讨论，在讨论过程中，这位苏联科学家回答了加拿大、美国、荷兰、英国、印度、阿根廷的代表所提出的一系列问题。
    英国科学家希尔和约斯林的报告谈到了英国开始实行发展原子能计划所需的资金的问题。
    美国原子能委员会委员戴维斯在报告中谈到了建设原子能发电站所必需的投资的问题。据戴维斯的计算，设计中发电能力每一瓩的发电站设备约需二百五十美元的投资。
    九日下午会议讨论了核子动力的经济、钍的作用以及司法和行政管理问题。
    赖因（美国）和约克斯（英国）就“核子动力的经济”做了报告。
    英国科学家戴沃特做了关于钍的作用的报告。
    日本科学家铃江、英国科学家宾克斯、美国科学家泰勒所作的报告谈了核子动力的司法和行政管理问题，世界卫生组织的报告也谈到这个问题。世界卫生组织的报告中指出，自从发现了铀的分裂以来，在工作中防范辐射线的问题已经成为保健方面的一个重大任务。从全世界利用原子能的前途来看，人民保健机关应该担负起解决防范辐射线的问题的责任。
