The people of Anxi County, Gansu Province, have suffered from wind and sand for nearly a hundred years. Two years before liberation, the shifting sands almost buried the east wall of the county seat; the Anxi-Dunhuang highway south of the city was blocked by sand dunes, making travel difficult. Many villages and thousands of acres of farmland were submerged, and the sand dunes stretched forward like mountain ranges, one after another. These shifting sands all came from the Shule River. After passing through more than one hundred kilometers of the vast Gobi Desert, the Shule River carried a large amount of gravel and sand to the foot of Anxi City, and then turned east to flow northwest. Such a large detour caused the Shule River to deposit a large amount of sand and gravel. Every winter and spring, when the river dries up, the wind blows and these shifting sands rise up, covering the sky and the earth. Over time, this formed a broad "sand river" more than twenty kilometers long. Areas sixty miles away were affected by its encroachment. Crops had to be sown three or four times a year, and sometimes seedlings could not be guaranteed. Ditches had to be dug fourteen or fifteen times a year. Many farmers moved to other places, turning this place into a desolate sandy area.

After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the people began the struggle to control and transform the "sand river." In 1950, the people of the First District, who suffered the most from wind and sand, took action first. Over the past few years, they have built 800 mu of sandbreak forests in the "sand source" area on the south bank of the Shule River east of Anxi City, and built a 690-zhang-long sandbreak dam in the Shule River bend, cutting off the "sand source." At the same time, more than 600 mu of sandbreak forests were built in the shifting sand area south of the city, and more than 30,000 mu of wasteland and sand dunes were gradually closed off for grass cultivation. Now, white-headed wormwood and red willow, which are resistant to sand and drought, have generally grown. With grass and trees blocking the wind and sand, the amount of sand blown up has been greatly reduced, and the movement of sand dunes has gradually disappeared.

In order to completely transform the sand river, Anxi County established a sand control committee in 1953 and formulated a plan to control the shifting sand in sections. A 170-zhang-long and 1.3-zhang-high sand control wall was built in the middle of the sand river, and more than 1,100 zhang of various silt-retaining dams were built. Methods such as soil compaction, thorn barriers, water diversion, and wind blowing were also used to gather and block those large and small shifting sand dunes, or wash them away and level them to develop farmland and orchards. Now, the shifting sand on more than 15,000 mu of farmland in three townships and two streets within a range of more than three li wide and more than forty li long downstream from the "sand source" area, and the more than 30,000 mu of sandy land and sand dunes on both sides of the "sand river" have been basically controlled, preventing the phenomenon of shifting sand pressing on the land. At the same time, more than 1,500 mu of farmland have been developed, of which more than 1,000 mu have been planted with crops. In 1954, more than 340 shi of grain were harvested, and it is estimated that more than 570 shi can be harvested this year. Due to the reduction of the impact of wind and sand, the nearby rural areas have become prosperous. Sigong Township, downstream of the "sand river," was originally a large township with more than 1,000 households and more than 6,000 mu of farmland. Before liberation, only more than 60 households and more than 2,000 mu of cultivated land remained. Now, most of the wasteland in Sigong Township has been reclaimed. Last year, the average yield per mu was more than 330 jin of grain, and the number of households has increased to 144, of which 70 percent are surplus grain households. Last year, they sold 140,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.

In order to completely eliminate the disaster of wind and sand, the people of Anxi are continuing to carry out sand suppression and tree planting and grass cultivation. They plan to turn about 500 mu of sand dunes into beautiful forests and grasslands in the next two or three years.

    同风沙作斗争的安西人民
    王达
    甘肃省安西县近百年来一直遭受着风沙的侵害。到解放前两年，流沙几乎埋住了县城的东墙；城南的安（西）敦（煌）公路被沙山阻挡不便通行，许多村庄和千万亩农田被淹没，沙堆像山岭一样一个连一个地向前延伸。这些流沙都是由疏勒河来的。疏勒河经过一百多公里长的大戈壁滩，挟带了大量碎石沙砾来到安西城下，就由东折向西北流去。这样一个大迂回，使疏勒河挟带的大量沙石沉留下来。每到冬春两季河水干枯的时候，风一吹动，这些流沙就扫天卷地而起，天长日久就形成了一条长达二十多公里的宽阔的“沙河”。六十里以外地区都受到了它的侵袭。庄稼每年要播种三、四次，有时还不能保苗。渠道一年要挖十四、五次。许多农民迁往他乡，使这里变成一片沙荒。
    解放以后，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，人民开始了控制和改造“沙河”的斗争。一九五○年，受风沙侵袭最厉害的第一区人民，首先行动起来。几年来他们在安西城东疏勒河南岸“沙源”地区营造了八百亩防沙林，在疏勒河河湾修建了长达六百九十丈的防沙坝，切断了“沙源”；同时在城南流沙地带营造了六百多亩防沙林，三万多亩荒滩和沙丘也逐渐实行封滩育草，现已普遍生长起白头蒿子和红柳等抗沙耐旱的草木。风沙有草木阻挡，起飞量已大大减少，沙丘的活动逐渐消失。
    为了彻底改造沙河，一九五三年，安西县成立了防沙委员会，制定了分段制服流沙的计划。在沙河中段打了一个长一百七十丈、高达一丈三尺的防沙墙，并做各种淤沙坝一千一百多丈。还采用土压、茨挡、水拉、风吹等办法把那些大大小小的流沙堆，或聚集封锁起来，或冲走拉平开拓成农田果林。现在从“沙源”地区向下三里多宽、四十多里长范围以内的三个乡两个街的一万五千多亩农田上的流沙，和“沙河”两岸的三万多亩沙滩和沙丘已基本上被控制住，阻止了流沙压地的现象。同时，还开拓出一千五百多亩农田，其中有千多亩已种上庄稼，一九五四年收了三百四十多石粮食，估计今年可收五百七十多石。由于减少了风沙的影响，附近农村已趋向繁荣。“沙河”下游的四弓乡原是一个一千多户、六千多亩农田大乡，到解放前，只剩下了六十多户和两千多亩耕地。现在四弓乡大部分荒地已开垦出来，去年平均每亩产粮三百三十多斤，农户也增加到一百四十四户，其中并有百分之七十是余粮户，去年他们就卖给国家十四万斤余粮。
    为了彻底杜绝风沙的灾害，安西人民还在继续进行压沙和种树育草等工作，他们计划在今后两三年内把大约五百亩沙丘变成美丽的树林草地。
