Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, August 27th: Li Yimang, Secretary-General of the Delegation of the People's Republic of China to the 44th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference, wrote a letter on August 27th to Lord Stansgate, Chairman of the Inter-Parliamentary Union Council. The full text of the letter is as follows: To Lord Stansgate, Chairman of the Inter-Parliamentary Union Council, and to all Council Members and Delegates to the 44th Conference:

　　Peng Zhen, Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, telegraphed Chairman Stansgate, Secretary-General de Blonay, and Chairman Fagerholm of the Organizing Committee on July 24th of this year, informing them that the representatives of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China had decided to join the Inter-Parliamentary Union and had decided to send a delegation to the 44th Union Conference. Subsequently, a People's Delegation of the People's Republic of China to the Inter-Parliamentary Union was formed by one thousand and ninety representatives (the number of participating representatives has now reached one thousand one hundred and three, accounting for ninety percent of the total number of representatives of the National People's Congress). The Union has been notified of these circumstances and the list of the Chinese delegation attending this Conference. At the same time, the Chinese delegation carried out various preparatory works for attending this Conference, and sent this Secretary-General and Representative Wu Wentao to Helsinki in advance to prepare everything.

　　Now, the Executive Committee of the Union, merely due to the insistence and opposition of a few committee members from the United States and other countries, has shelved the application of the People's Delegation of the People's Republic of China to join the Inter-Parliamentary Union, making it impossible for the delegation of the People's Republic of China to participate in the Conference as scheduled, which in effect obstructs the participation of the delegation of the People's Republic of China in the Union. We feel extremely regretful about this decision. Now, in the name of the Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Delegation to the Union Conference, I express my stern protest against the decision of the Executive Committee of the Union, and request the Council and the Conference to correct this erroneous decision.

　　I think all fair-minded people will know that only the People's Delegation composed of representatives of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China has the right to represent China in the Inter-Parliamentary Union. The participation of the Chinese People's Delegation in the Inter-Parliamentary Union is of great benefit and necessity to expand exchanges between parliamentarians of various countries, promote friendly cooperation between countries, ease international tensions and build trust between countries; otherwise, it is not only ignoring the rights of the Chinese people and being unfriendly to the Chinese people, but also violating the Union's purpose and the entire charter, and running counter to the general direction of easing current international tensions.

　　I believe that Council Members and representatives from various countries who are faithful to the organizational purpose and the entire charter of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and who safeguard the cause of world peace, will support our just demands and resolutely correct the erroneous decision made by the Executive Committee of the Union, which violates the Union's charter and violates the wishes of all just and peace-loving people in the world, in order to redeem the damage caused by this erroneous decision to the Union's prestige and ensure that the Union plays its due role in promoting peaceful coexistence and mutual trust among countries.

　　Awaiting your reply, and with best regards.

　　Secretary-General of the Delegation of the People's Republic of China to the 44th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference, Li Yimang

　　我出席各国议会联盟大会代表团秘书长函联盟理事会主席
　　要求纠正执委会阻挠我国参加的错误决定
    新华社赫尔辛基二十七日电　中华人民共和国出席各国议会联盟第四十四届大会代表团秘书长李一氓在八月二十七日写信给各国议会联盟理事会主席斯坦斯盖特勋爵，信件全文如下：各国议会联盟理事会主席斯坦斯盖特勋爵并转理事会全体理事先生们和第四十四届大会全体代表先生们：
    中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会秘书长彭真于今年七月二十四日即致电斯坦斯盖特主席、德布隆内秘书长和组织委员会法格霍姆主席，通知中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会代表们已决定参加各国议会联盟，并决定派遣代表团出席第四十四届联盟大会。接着即由一千零九十个代表（现参加的代表已达一千一百零三人，占全国人民代表大会代表总数的百分之九十）组成了中华人民共和国参加各国议会联盟的人民代表团，这些情况和出席本届联盟大会的中国代表团名单等都已经通知联盟。同时，中国代表团进行了出席本届大会的各项准备工作，并派本秘书长和吴文焘代表先来赫尔辛基准备一切。
    现在联盟执行委员会仅仅由于美国等国少数委员的坚持反对，竟将中华人民共和国的人民代表团参加各国议会联盟的申请搁置起来，使中华人民共和国代表团不能如期参加大会，实际上就是阻挠中华人民共和国代表团参加联盟。对这个决定我们感到万分遗憾。现在，我以出席联盟大会中国人民代表团秘书长的名义，对联盟执行委员会的决定表示严正的抗议，并请求理事会和大会纠正这一错误的决定。
    我想一切态度公正的人士都会知道，有权代表中国参加各国议会联盟的只有中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会的代表们所组成的人民代表团。中国人民代表团参加各国议会联盟，对扩大各国议员间的交往，促进各国间的友好合作，和缓国际紧张局势和建立国同国间的信任，是有极大的好处和必要的，否则不但是漠视中国人民的权利和对中国人民不友好，而且是违反联盟宗旨和整个章程，同目前和缓国际紧张局势的总的方向背道而驰的。
    我相信，忠实于各国议会联盟组织宗旨和整个章程以及维护世界和平事业的理事先生们和各国代表先生们都会支持我们的正义要求，断然纠正联盟执行委员会违反联盟章程，违反世界一切公正和爱好和平人士的愿望所作的错误决定，以挽回这一错误的决定对联盟的威信所造成的损伤，并保证联盟在促进各国间和平共处和互相信任的事业中发挥应有的作用。
    伫候回音，并此致意。
    中华人民共和国出席各国议会联盟
      第四十四届大会代表团秘书长李一氓
                      一九五五年八月二十七日
