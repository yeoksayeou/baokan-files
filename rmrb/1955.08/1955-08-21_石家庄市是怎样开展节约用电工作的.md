　　How Shijiazhuang Municipality Carries Out Electricity Conservation Work
　　Zhao Faping
　　Since liberation, the power industry in Shijiazhuang Municipality has greatly developed, with power generation equipment more than doubling compared to before liberation; attention has also been paid to leveraging the potential of existing equipment. However, in recent years, due to the development of factory production and construction undertakings in the city, and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, the amount of electricity that needs to be supplied has increased year by year. Especially this year, with large-scale basic construction tasks, the maximum power supply load will be 1060 percent of that in 1948, an increase of 63 percent compared to 1954. Due to the rapid rise in power supply load, although continuously increasing power generation equipment still cannot keep up with actual needs, the city's electricity is still in a state of supply falling short of demand this year. According to estimates at the beginning of this year, the city's electricity shortage is equivalent to one-tenth of the total electricity consumption. If this problem is not resolved early, it will affect production and basic construction units from completing their production and construction plans.

　　The main reason why the city's electricity supply cannot meet demand is due to the increase in electricity demand; but at the same time, there are also many unreasonable and serious waste phenomena in electricity use. The most important thing is that the power factor of factories and mining enterprises is too low. According to statistics from the Shijiazhuang Power Supply Bureau last year, only eight of the city's 30 larger factories and mining enterprises met the required 75 percent power factor, while the rest did not meet this requirement, some even reaching only 34 percent. The lowest power factor of the city's power grid can only reach 69 percent. Therefore, the output of generators is reduced by 2,450 kilowatts, which is equivalent to wasting the entire annual production electricity consumption of a textile factory with 50,000 spindles and 1,500 looms. Due to the failure to meet the required power factor, the city's industrial sector was fined more than 90,000 yuan in a year. In addition, the waste of electricity for lighting and other purposes is also very serious, such as opening several sun lamps or chandeliers in an office for one person, not turning off the lights when sleeping in dormitories, having too many or too large light bulbs, turning on all the lights on the night-lit court for one person to play, public lights being on during the day, and power equipment still running during rest, etc. These phenomena of wasting electricity are common in factories, mines, construction sites, government agencies, and the daily lives of citizens.

　　In order to reduce or eliminate the phenomenon of electricity waste in the city, so as to fully exploit the huge potential of the city's power equipment, starting from the first half of this year, under the leadership of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, factories and mining enterprises throughout the city mobilized the masses of employees and adopted various effective measures to carry out electricity conservation work.

　　After the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on electricity conservation work, most factories and mines formulated electricity conservation plans and took active actions. For example, the Shijiazhuang Textile Factory saved 190,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity in the first quarter. However, some units did not pay enough attention to electricity conservation work. Some members of the Party Committee of the Pharmaceutical Factory of the Shijiazhuang Local Industry Bureau believed: "There is a lot of work now, there is no time, let's study it later!" The leading staff of the Shijiazhuang Daxing Yarn Factory and the Shijiazhuang Second Automobile Repair Factory turned a blind eye to electricity conservation work, simply pushing it to the electromechanical department. When the State-owned No. 1 Cotton Mill had excessive electrical equipment, the Shijiazhuang Power Supply Bureau dismantled the factory's surplus equipment, and the factory's leaders even showed resistance. The Municipal Committee conducted a comprehensive inspection of units that did not actively implement the Municipal Committee's instructions and criticized them in the newspaper; it conducted persuasion and education on units that resisted the dismantling of equipment and resolutely supported the Shijiazhuang Power Supply Bureau's practice of dismantling unreasonable electrical equipment. At various meetings, especially at electricity conservation meetings, the importance of electricity conservation was repeatedly pointed out, and newspapers and radio stations were used to carry out publicity work throughout the city, and the Municipal Power Supply Bureau introduced specific methods for electricity conservation. After these efforts, the erroneous idea of not paying attention to electricity conservation has been greatly reversed. However, by May, when each unit saw that the surplus equipment had been removed and the power factor had been greatly improved, a common feeling of complacency and relaxation arose. Some dormitories changed the small light bulbs that had been replaced back to large light bulbs, and some systems that had been established could not be consistently implemented, resulting in a decrease in the city's power factor in June compared to May. The Industrial Department of the Municipal Committee studied these situations, held a meeting in a timely manner, seriously criticized complacency and relaxation, and put forward further requirements, so that electricity conservation work could continue.

　　During the development, the Municipal Committee also successively held two electricity conservation experience exchange meetings, learning and promoting more than 12 advanced experiences from the Soviet Union and some advanced regions in our country related to improving the power factor and reducing the power consumption of products, which played a great role in ensuring electricity conservation. For example, the three flour mills under the Shijiazhuang Municipal Industry Bureau reduced the unit power consumption by 304,700 kilowatt-hours in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year due to the implementation of advanced electricity conservation experiences such as roller drawing and strict operating procedures. In the electricity conservation work of the Shijiazhuang Textile Factory, due to fully mobilizing the masses, advanced experiences such as changing the red car oil used in roving frames to spindle oil, changing ordinary spindle oil to Soviet spindle oil in spinning frames, adding butter to wooden shuttles in cloth fields to increase the sliding force of the shuttle, and adjusting spindle belts were used, which reduced the unit product power consumption by 8 to 10 percent respectively, and each piece of yarn could save 30 kilowatt-hours of electricity. In the first half of the year alone, the factory saved 329,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity, and the power factor increased from 75 percent to 96 percent.

　　In order to enable electricity conservation work to be carried out rapidly and regularly, the Municipal Committee also grasped the key points, conducted in-depth inspections, and promoted work in a timely manner. The city focused on power users with the most electricity consumption and the most waste, and among power users, it focused on the machinery and iron industry and the textile industry with the most serious waste and the most electricity consumption, and formed an inspection team to conduct inspections. After inspection, it was found that the Shijiazhuang Freight Car Factory and the Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Factory had the lowest power factor and the most waste. During the inspection, the causes of waste were discovered and solutions were found, which further promoted electricity conservation work. For example, after inspection, the Freight Car Factory dismantled 77 horsepower of motors and 30 kVA of transformers, and the power factor reached the specified requirements.

　　In addition, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, together with relevant departments, also held electrician training classes. Through explaining and introducing electricity conservation experiences, electricians mastered electricity conservation knowledge and improved their understanding of the importance of electricity conservation, becoming the backbone of electricity conservation work. In order to improve the power factor, 3,560 kvar of capacitors were installed throughout the city, and the delta connection method of the motor was changed to the star connection method, which improved the current power factor. In order to improve the power factor and reduce peak load, time was also rationally allocated, and the weekly rest time, commuting time, eating time, and driving time of each factory and mine were staggered and appropriately adjusted.

　　Due to the adoption of the above measures, all units in the city have generally improved the power factor, adjusted the load, and greatly saved electricity. The power factor increased from the highest of 75 percent in January to 83.9 percent at the end of June, reducing the peak load by 200 kilowatts per month. In half a year, simply by improving the power factor, adjusting the load, and increasing the generator output, more than 4 million kilowatt-hours of electricity were generated, and the city saved more than 500,000 kilowatt-hours of lighting electricity in two quarters. This ensured industrial production, met the needs of the people, and initially solved the problem of insufficient electricity. In the first quarter, when the No. 1 unit of the Weishui Power Plant was overhauled, due to insufficient electricity (a shortage of 1,100 kilowatts), it was originally planned to restrict the production electricity consumption of some units. After carrying out electricity conservation, not only was there no shortage of electricity, but there was also a surplus of 400 kilowatts of electricity. In addition, it also saved national expenditures and reduced enterprise costs. For example, after rationally adjusting equipment, 1,780 kVA of transformers and 581 horsepower of motors were removed. If these removed equipment were used for production, it could reduce the country's investment by more than 290,000 yuan. The number of fined households among the city's 30 larger factories and mines decreased by 12 percent, and the number of rewarded households due to high power factor increased by 10 percent. The electricity expenditure of general factories and mines has decreased.

　　Although Shijiazhuang Municipality has achieved the above-mentioned achievements in carrying out electricity conservation, it has not been done deeply enough. Some units only pay attention to overcoming superficial waste, and do not pay close attention to further reducing the power consumption of production electricity. The masses have not been mobilized widely enough. Necessary systems have not been established in power supply management and daily contact. No one is specifically responsible for managing lighting electricity, etc. All of these require further efforts.

　　石家庄市是怎样开展节约用电工作的
　　赵发平
    石家庄市自解放以来，电力工业有了很大发展，发电设备比解放前增加了两倍以上；同时也注意发挥原有设备的潜力。但几年来，由于全市工厂生产和建筑事业的发展，人民生活水平不断提高，需要供应的电量也就一年比一年多。尤其是今年，基本建设任务大，最高供电负荷将为一九四八年的百分之一千零六十，比一九五四年增加百分之六十三。由于供电负荷迅速上升，虽然不断增加发电设备仍然赶不上实际需要，今年全市电力仍处于供不应求的状态，据今年年初预计，全市缺电量相当于全部用电量的十分之一。如不及早解决这一问题，将会影响生产和基本建设单位完成生产和建设计划。
    全市电力所以供不应求，主要原因是由于电的需用量增加；但同时在用电上也有许多不合理的和严重的浪费现象。最重要的是厂矿企业的用电力率太低。据石家庄电业局去年统计，全市三十个较大厂矿企业，仅有八个单位用电力率达到所规定的百分之七十五的要求，其余的单位都达不到这个要求，有的甚至只达到百分之三十四。全市电网力率最低时，只能达到百分之六十九。因此，就使发电机出力降低二千四百五十瓩，等于浪费掉一个拥有五万纱锭、一千五百台织布机设备的纺织厂的全年全部生产用电。因用电力率达不到要求，全市工业部门一年就被罚款九万多元。另外照明和其它用电的浪费现象也很严重，如一人办公开数盏太阳灯或吊灯，宿舍睡觉不关灯，灯泡过多过大，一人在夜光球场玩全场开灯，公用电灯在白天还开着，休息时动力设备仍然转动等等，这些浪费电力的现象，在厂矿、工地、机关、市民日常生活中都普遍存在。
    为了减少或消除全市电力浪费的现象，以充分发挥全市电力设备的巨大潜力，从今年上半年开始，在中共石家庄市委领导下，全市厂矿企业即发动职工群众，采取各种有效措施，开展了节约用电工作。
    当中共石家庄市委布置节约用电工作的指示以后，大部分厂矿都订出节约用电计划，积极行动起来，如石家庄纺织厂在第一季就节约用电十九万度。但也有部分单位对节约用电工作不够重视。石家庄地方工业局制药厂党委有些人认为：“现在工作很多，没有时间，以后研究研究再说吧！”石家庄大兴纱厂和石家庄第二汽车修理厂的领导工作人员对节约用电工作不闻不问，只推给机电部门就算完事。国棉一厂因电气设备过大，石家庄电业局把该厂的多余设备拆除时，该厂领导人员还有抵触情绪。市委对不积极贯彻市委指示的单位进行了全面检查，并在报纸上批评；对于对拆除设备有抵触情绪的单位进行了说服教育，并坚决支持市电业局拆除不合理的电气设备的做法。在各种会议特别是在节约用电会议上，一再指明节约用电的重要意义，并利用报纸和广播电台在全市展开宣传工作，又由市电业局介绍有关节约用电的具体办法。经过这些工作，不重视节约用电的错误思想已大大扭转。但到五月份，各单位见到多余设备已撤出，用电力率已大有提高，又较普遍地产生了自满和松懈情绪，有些宿舍又把已换上的小灯泡改成大灯泡，有的订了制度不能坚持贯彻，致使全市用电力率到六月份又较五月份降低。市委工业部研究了这些情况，及时召开会议，严肃地批判了自满和松懈情绪，提出了进一步的要求，使节约用电工作继续开展下去。
    在开展的期间，市委又先后召开了两次节约用电经验交流会，学习并推广了苏联和我国一些先进地区有关提高用电力率降低产品电耗等先进经验十二种以上，对保证节约用电起了很大作用。如市工业局所属三个面粉厂由于推行了磨棍拉丝等先进节约用电经验，严格了操作规程，降低了单位电耗，今年上半年就比去年同期少用电三十万四千七百度。石家庄纺织厂在节约用电工作中，由于充分发动群众，将粗纱车由原用红车油改换为锭子油，细纱车由普通锭子油换成苏联锭子油，布场木梭加黄油，以增加梭的滑力和调整锭带等先进经验，使单位产品电耗分别降低百分之八到百分之十，每件纱可少用电三十度，仅上半年全厂节约用电就达三十二万九千度，使用电力率由百分之七十五提高到百分之九十六。
    为了使节约用电工作能够迅速开展并经常进行，市委又抓住重点，深入检查，及时推动工作。在全市以用电最多浪费最大的动力用户为重点，在动力用电户中又以浪费最严重的机铁业和用电最多的纺织业为重点，组成检查组进行了检查。经过检查，又发现石家庄货车工厂、石家庄动力机械工厂用电力率最低、浪费也最大。在检查中，发现了浪费的原因，找出了解决的办法，使节约用电工作进一步开展。如货车工厂经过检查，拆除了电动机七十七马力、变压器三十仟伏安，使用电力率达到了规定要求。
    另外，市工会会同有关部门又举办了电工训练班，通过讲解和介绍节约用电经验，使电工掌握了节约用电知识，提高了对节约用电重要性的认识，成为节约用电工作中的骨干。为了提高用电力率，全市又安装了三千五百六十仟乏尔电容器，将电动机三角接线法改为星形接线法，提高了电流力率。为提高用电力率，压低高峰负荷，又合理地分配了时间，将各厂矿每星期的休息时间、上下班和吃饭、开车时间都互相错开，进行了适当的调整。
    由于采取了以上各项措施，全市各单位普遍提高了用电力率，调整了负荷，大大节省了电力。用电力率由一月份最高的百分之七十五，到六月底已提高到百分之八十三点九，每月压低高峰负荷二百瓩。半年来，只力率提高、负荷调整，提高发电机出力，就多发电四百多万度，全市在两个季度中节约照明用电五十多万度。这样就保证了工业生产，满足了人民需要，初步解决了电力不够用的问题。在第一季度，微水发电厂一号机检修时，因电力不够用（缺一千一百瓩），原计划限制一些单位生产用电，经过开展节约用电以后，不但不再缺电，而且还余下四百瓩的电力。另外，还节省了国家开支，降低了企业成本。如经过合理调整设备，撤出了变压器一千七百八十仟伏安，电动机五百八十一马力，如将这些撤出的设备用到生产上，可减少国家投资二十九万多元。全市三十个较大厂矿中被罚款户减少了百分之十二，因用电力率高受奖户增加了百分之十，一般厂矿用电开支都有减少。
    石家庄市在开展节约用电方面，虽然获得了上述成绩，但是作得还不够深入，有些单位只重视克服表面上的浪费，对进一步降低生产用电的耗电量还抓得不紧，群众发动得还不够普遍，在供电管理、日常联系等方面还没有建立起必要的制度，照明用电没有专人管理等，这些都有待进一步的努力。
