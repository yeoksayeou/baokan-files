　　Newly Purchased Cloth Ration Coupons to be Issued Before the End of August

　　Throughout the country, the second annual cloth ration coupons for planned cotton cloth supply will be issued to consumers before the end of August.

　　The validity period of the first annual cloth ration coupons for planned cotton cloth supply (September 15, 1954, to August 31, 1955) will expire at the end of August; they will be invalid after the expiration date. If new cloth ration coupons cannot be distributed to the masses by the end of August due to inconvenient transportation, the Ministry of Commerce has decided that the old ration coupons in these areas can be extended, but not beyond September 15. The specific areas and expiration dates shall be determined by the provinces themselves.

　　The Ministry of Commerce has decided that if consumers in various regions have temporary needs for cloth, such as for weddings, childbirth, or deaths, they can still apply for purchase at any time, based on the spirit of conserving cloth. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　新购布票将在八月底前发出
    全国各地将在八月底前，把棉布计划供应第二年度的购布票发给消费者。
    棉布计划供应第一年度（一九五四年九月十五日到一九五五年八月三十一日）的购布票使用期限，到八月底就要截止，过期作废。如因交通不便，到八月底不能把新购布票发到群众手中，商业部决定这些地区的旧购布票可延期使用，但不能超过九月十五日，具体地区和截止使用时间由各省自行规定。
    商业部决定，各地消费者临时需要用布，如逢结婚、生育、死亡等事，仍可由用户本着节约用布的精神，随时申请购买。　（新华社）
