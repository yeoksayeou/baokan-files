    Developing Agriculture Is the Basic Condition for Guaranteeing the Completion of Industrial and Overall Economic Plans
    Liu Ruilong
    The First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of our country, adopted by the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, clearly stipulates the plan for the development of agriculture in our country, and profoundly points out the extreme importance of developing agriculture for the development of industry in our country.
    Socialist industrialization is the main body of the general task of the country during the transition period, and the basic link in realizing socialist industrialization is to prioritize the development of heavy industry. This is the only correct policy for establishing a strong material foundation for my country's socialist cause, making our country rich and strong, and making the people happy. Only socialist industrialization focusing on the development of the country's heavy industry can enable my country's agriculture, light industry, and transportation industry to obtain technological transformation, change the backward state of my country in these areas, and comprehensively develop my country's national economy. Only heavy industry can supply a large number of tractors, agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, diesel oil, water conservancy engineering equipment, and the means of production needed for a large amount of land reclamation. When we have these modern equipment and means of production, we can fundamentally change the face of agriculture and further improve agricultural production. Only heavy industry can produce modern transportation tools and light industry machinery. With the development of heavy industry, the transportation industry and light industry will also develop, so as to systematically improve people's lives. Only heavy industry can manufacture modern weapons to equip our army and consolidate national defense. Therefore, realizing socialist industrialization and prioritizing the development of heavy industry is the basic link in my country's socialist construction and socialist transformation. Resolutely implementing this policy is in the greatest interest of the Chinese people.
    Using all methods to develop industry, and prioritizing the development of heavy industry, must not diminish the significance of developing agriculture. Without the corresponding development of agriculture, the cause of socialist industrialization in our country cannot be realized. Comrade Mao Zedong said as early as 1945: "The peasants—this is the main body of China's industrial market. Only they can supply the richest grain and raw materials, and absorb the largest amount of industrial products." Agriculture is the supplier of grain and raw materials, and farmers are also consumers of a large part of industrial products. Agriculture is the foundation for the development of industry. A strong industry must have the support of continuously rising agricultural production. We must develop agriculture accordingly while developing industry.
    Only by developing agriculture correspondingly can we supply the increasing demand for grain in cities and industrial and mining areas, can we supply industry with the necessary raw materials, and can we supply export agricultural products necessary for importing industrial equipment. Only by developing agriculture correspondingly can farmers' incomes increase, purchasing power increase, and a broad market be opened up for industry, thereby promoting the development of industry.
    Socialist industry develops smoothly because it obtains the supply of grain and raw materials, and its products obtain sales channels. Farmers' production increases, their incomes increase, and their lives are continuously improved. This is the material foundation for the continuous consolidation and strengthening of the people's democratic dictatorship based on the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class, and it is a reliable guarantee for the smooth progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation.
    Developing agriculture, ensuring that agricultural production is adapted to the development of industry, and preventing and overcoming the phenomenon of separation between agriculture and industry are major and urgent tasks for us in building socialism.
    The agricultural part of the Five-Year Plan makes comprehensive and thoughtful arrangements for the needs of the country and the people. The Five-Year Plan requires strengthening the worker-peasant alliance and the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas to promote a new upsurge in agriculture, and requires ensuring the necessary annual increase in grain, cotton, oilseeds, and other technical crops. The Five-Year Plan clearly stipulates our agricultural production increase plan to reach 1957: grain will reach 385.6 billion catties, cotton will reach 32.7 million dan, jute and ambary hemp will reach 7.3 million dan, flue-cured tobacco will reach 7.8 million dan, sugarcane will reach 26.3 billion catties, beet will reach 4.27 billion catties, and the planting area of oil crops will reach 118 million mu. In terms of increasing livestock, cattle should reach 73.61 million heads, pigs should reach 138.34 million heads, and horses, donkeys, mules, sheep, poultry, etc. should all be vigorously increased. In terms of increasing aquatic products, the total output in 1957 should reach 2.807 million tons.
    This is the necessary requirement put forward by the state for agricultural production. This plan is in line with the realistic needs of the planned and proportionate development of my country's national economy. This is the goal of struggle for farmers, agricultural scientists, agricultural workers, and other people in the country in the agricultural field during the first Five-Year Plan period. We must make every effort to fully realize and strive to overfulfill this plan.
    By resolutely completing and overfulfilling this plan, we will have the confidence to ensure that the development of agriculture is adapted to the development of industry, and we can overcome and prevent the phenomenon of separation between agriculture and industry.
    Some people doubt: "According to the provisions of the Five-Year Plan, can the increase in grain output be adapted to the growth of my country's population?" We say that according to the current survey and statistical data, the two are adapted. Today our grain is enough to eat. We resolutely complete the Five-Year Plan, and we may also reserve a part of our grain. The per capita grain consumption level may also increase to some extent.
    Of course, our task is arduous. In the first two years of the first Five-Year Plan, there was spring drought and autumn flooding in 1953, and many places encountered severe floods in 1954. Although grain production increased in these two years, it did not complete the originally planned production increase plan, which had to increase the tasks for the last three years. The production increase indicators for the last three years of the Five-Year Plan are still very high. Today, my country's agricultural equipment is backward, and my country's industry has not yet developed to the extent that it can reclaim large areas of wasteland and help agriculture across the country complete technological transformation. Small-scale peasant economy still dominates in my country's agriculture, and the task of agricultural cooperation needs a considerable amount of time to gradually complete. Every year, there are also 20 to 40 million people in my country who suffer from varying degrees of drought and flood disasters. These unfavorable conditions cannot but increase the difficulty for us to complete the task. We must carry out arduous work and complete our agricultural production increase task in the process of gradually overcoming difficulties.
    Judging from the basic situation of agricultural production in our country, we can complete the agricultural production increase task stipulated in the Five-Year Plan.
    There are large areas of wasteland that can be reclaimed in Northeast, Northwest, Southwest China, and coastal and riverside areas. According to preliminary estimates based on existing data, the wasteland that can be reclaimed in my country is roughly equal to the existing cultivated land. My country also has vast mountains, lakes, and rivers that can be fully utilized. Most areas of our country are in the temperate zone, and some areas are in the subtropical and tropical zones. The climate is mild, the rainfall is abundant, the frost-free period is long, the natural conditions are superior, and the potential for production increase is great. My country has a large labor force, farmers are diligent and hardworking, and farmers in most areas have long-term accumulated experience in intensive farming.
    What is particularly important is that our country is a people's democratic country. After the reform of the land system, farmers are developing agricultural cooperation, and farmers' enthusiasm for increasing production is increasing, and investment in agricultural production is increasing. Due to the development of my country's industry, the state's economic and technical assistance to farmers is constantly growing. These will open up a path for a new upsurge in agriculture in our country.
    We have all the necessary conditions to overcome difficulties and complete the plan. We must carry forward the spirit of hard struggle to overcome difficulties, and be good at using various conditions to overcome difficulties.
    Under today's conditions, the decisive link in completing the agricultural production increase plan is to actively and step by step, on the basis of the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, rely on the poor peasants, consolidate the unity of the middle peasants, and develop agricultural cooperation. The Five-Year Plan emphasizes that the agricultural production increase plan in the first five years should pay special attention to relying on agricultural production cooperatives characterized by the current land shares and unified management to carry out appropriate preliminary technical improvements to tap the potential power of agriculture and increase the yield per unit area. As Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report, under the current circumstances, "This is an agricultural production increase method with less investment, greater efficiency, and faster efficiency, and it is a necessary step to guide farmers towards socialism." As long as we strengthen education for farmers in accordance with the requirements of the first Five-Year Plan, improve farmers' socialist awareness, organize farmers, and move towards cooperation step by step, coupled with appropriate preliminary technical improvements, we can achieve the goal of increasing production.
    During the Five-Year Plan period, individual farmers still account for a large proportion of the country's farmers, and the individual economy of agriculture still has a certain potential power. Therefore, it is necessary to correctly and fully exert the enthusiasm of individual farmers and increase agricultural production.
    In order to make agricultural production increase adapt to the development of industry, we must take various technical measures suitable to local conditions on the basis of agricultural cooperation and fully and effectively utilize existing cultivated land. This is the main method to achieve agricultural production increase today. At the same time, we must actively and systematically reclaim arable wasteland, which is the fundamental way to solve the problem of agricultural production increase in our country. Some people doubt the possibility of increasing the yield of existing cultivated land, and raise such questions: "Has the production increase capacity of existing cultivated land reached its peak, and will it reach its limit?" In fact, there is no need to doubt this. The facts of the development of agricultural production in China, and the experience of Chinese farmers in maintaining and improving soil fertility to achieve production increase, have already given the most vivid answer. Marx said: If the land is treated correctly, the land will be continuously improved. The experience of the Soviet Union further proves that the socialist system has all the possibilities to establish a rational agricultural system, which makes the land continuously improve in fertility and ensures that agricultural production can achieve the highest productivity. What should be done today is to make good use of existing cultivated land in accordance with the provisions of the Five-Year Plan and increase the yield per unit area.
    In order to make agricultural production increase adapt to the development of industry, a comprehensive arrangement must be made for all sectors of agriculture, various major crops, and various different agricultural regions, focusing on key points and vigorously managing them to promote the overall development of agriculture.
    All regions should formulate a five-year plan for local agricultural production increase based on local specific conditions and experience, and there must be an overall plan for increasing production in agriculture, animal husbandry, and fishery.
    In terms of crops, a reasonable arrangement should be made for food crops and technical crops. Without affecting the increase in food production, the area of technical crops should be appropriately expanded by utilizing the different conditions in various regions of the country. In terms of food, the expansion of high-yield crops should be promoted. In terms of cash crops, cotton, oilseeds, and hemp should be vigorously increased. We must pay special attention to grain production increase, which is the foundation of various agricultural production. Because grain increases can fully supply the grain needed by farmers in economic crop areas, so that they can let go of increasing the production of cotton, hemp, oilseeds, sugar crops, tobacco leaves, tea, silk, etc., and can fully supply the feed needed by animal husbandry, promote the development of animal husbandry. The upsurge in grain production makes us more confident to promote the upsurge in the production of other agricultural products and other sectors of agriculture.
    The tropical and subtropical natural conditions of South China should be fully utilized. Under the premise of completing the task of increasing grain production, economic crops that are conducive to the growth of the country and the people in these areas should be vigorously developed. Effective measures should be taken in some low-yield grain areas in North China to reduce disasters, exert land fertility, so that the yield can be stable and gradually improved.
    In order to make agricultural production increase adapt to the development of industry, we must be good at using the state's economic and technical assistance, so that these assistance are truly combined with the production increase measures of the broad masses of farmers to achieve the goal of increasing production. The economic and technical assistance provided by our country to farmers listed in the Five-Year Plan is unprecedented in the history of our country. If it is well utilized, it will play a great role in agricultural production increase. This requires that all regions must take various production increase measures based on the local climate characteristics and soil characteristics, and based on the planting conditions of various crops in the local area, so as to achieve good results.
    In order to make agricultural production increase adapt to the development of industry, we must strengthen agricultural scientific research work, that is, vigorously improve on the original basis, continue to improve, and gradually achieve planned and organized summary of farmers' experience, research and solve various specific problems that urgently need to be solved in agricultural production increase, and earnestly serve the country's agricultural production increase and promote agricultural cooperation. State-owned farms must strengthen their demonstration role in increasing production and saving to promote the broad masses of farmers.
    State functionaries in rural areas should concentrate their efforts to lead agricultural production, and fully exert the enthusiasm of local and mass enthusiasm, which is an important guarantee for completing the task of agricultural production increase.
    The first Five-Year Plan is a program with decisive significance for the Chinese Communist Party and the state organs of the People's Republic of China to lead the people of the whole country to strive to realize the general task of the transition period. In order to realize the cause of socialist industrialization in our country, we must strive to realize the agricultural production increase plan in the first Five-Year Plan.

    发展农业是保证工业和全部经济计划完成的基本条件
    刘瑞龙
    第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议通过的我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，明确地规定了发展我国农业的计划，深刻地指明了发展农业对于发展我国工业的极端重要性。
    社会主义工业化，是国家在过渡时期总任务的主体，实现社会主义工业化的基本环节，是优先发展重工业。这是为我国社会主义事业建立强大物质基础、使我们国家富强和人民幸福的唯一正确的政策。只有以发展国家的重工业为重点的社会主义工业化，才能使我国农业、轻工业、交通运输业获得技术的改造，改变我国在这些方面的落后状态，全面地发展我国的国民经济。只有重工业能够供应大量的拖拉机、农业机械、化学肥料、柴油、水利工程设备，以及大量开垦荒地所需要的生产资料，当我们有了这些现代化的设备和生产资料的时候，才能从根本上改变农业的面貌，更进一步地提高农业生产。只有重工业能够生产现代化的交通工具和轻工业的机器，随着重工业的发展，交通运输业、轻工业也发展起来，才能有系统地改善人民的生活。只有重工业能够制造现代化的武器来装备我国军队、巩固国防。因此，实现社会主义工业化，优先发展重工业，是我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造的基本环节。坚决贯彻这个政策，是我国人民的最大利益。
    用一切方法发展工业，优先发展重工业，决不能减轻发展农业的意义。没有农业的相应发展，我国的社会主义工业化事业是不可能实现的。毛泽东同志早在一九四五年就说过：“农民——这是中国工业市场的主体。只有他们能够供给最丰富的粮食和原料，并吸收最大量的工业品。”农业是粮食与原料的供应者，农民又是很大部分工业产品的消费者，农业是发展工业的基础，强大的工业必须有不断高涨的农业生产的支持，我们必须在发展工业的同时，相应地发展我国的农业。
    只有相应地发展农业，才能供应城市和工矿区日益增长的粮食需要，才能供应工业以必需的原料，才能供应为换进工业装备所必需的出口农产品。只有相应地发展农业，农民的收入才能增加，购买力才能提高，才能为工业开辟广阔的市场，促进工业的发展。
    社会主义工业由于获得粮食同原料的供应，产品获得销路而顺畅地发展，农民由于生产提高，收入增加，生活不断改善，这就是工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政不断地巩固和加强的物质基础，就是社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业顺利前进的可靠保证。
    发展农业，保证农业生产和工业的发展相适应，防止和克服农业和工业的脱节现象，是我们在建设社会主义事业中重大而迫切的任务。
    五年计划中的农业部分，对于国家和人民的需要，作了全面的周到的安排。五年计划要求加强工农联盟和城乡物资交流以促进农业的新高涨，要求保证粮食、棉花、油料及其他技术作物每年都有必要的增加。五年计划明确地规定我们到达一九五七年的农业增产计划：粮食达到三千八百五十六亿斤，棉花达到三千二百七十万担，黄麻、洋麻达到七百三十万担，烤烟达到七百八十万担，甘蔗达到二百六十三亿斤，甜菜达到四十二亿七千万斤，油料作物播种面积达到一亿一千八百万亩。在增殖牲畜方面，牛要达到七千三百六十一万头，猪要达到一亿三千八百三十四万头，马、驴、骡、羊、家禽等都应大力增殖。在增产水产物方面，一九五七年总产量要达到二百八十万七千吨。
    这是国家对农业生产所提出的必需的要求，这个计划是符合于我国国民经济有计划按比例发展的现实需要的。这是全国农民、农业科学家、农业工作者和其他人民群众在第一个五年计划期间内在农业方面的奋斗目标，我们必须尽一切努力完满地实现并争取超额完成这个计划。
    坚决地完成和超额完成这个计划，我们就有把握保证农业的发展与工业相适应，就能克服和防止农业和工业的脱节现象。
    有人怀疑：“依照五年计划的规定，粮食产量的增长是否能与我国人口的增长相适应？”我们说，根据现在的调查统计资料，这两者是相适应的，今天我们的粮食是够吃的，我们坚决完成五年计划，我们的粮食还可能储备一部分，每人的粮食消费水平，还可能在某种程度内提高。
    当然，我们的任务是艰巨的。在第一个五年计划的头两年，一九五三年春旱秋涝，一九五四年许多地方遇到特大洪水，这两年粮食生产虽有增加，但没有完成原来拟定的增产计划，这就不得不加重后三年的任务。五年计划中后三年的增产指标，仍然是很高的。今天我国农业设备落后，我国的工业还没有发展到足以大量开垦荒地和帮助全国农业完成技术改造的程度。我国农业中小农经济仍占优势，农业合作化的任务还需要相当的时间才能逐步完成。我国每年还有两千万到四千万人口的地区遭受不同程度的水旱灾害。这些不利条件，不能不增加我们完成任务的困难，我们必须进行艰苦的工作，在逐步克服困难的过程中，完成我们的农业增产任务。
    从我国农业生产的基本情况看，我们是可以完成五年计划所规定的农业增产任务的。
    我国东北、西北、西南和沿海、沿江地区，有大片荒地可以开垦。据现有资料初步估算，我国可以开垦的荒地，约略和现有耕地相等。我国还有广大的山地、湖泊、江河可以充分利用。我国绝大部分地区处于温带，还有一部分地区处于亚热带和热带，气候温和，雨量充沛，无霜期较长，自然条件优越，增产潜力很大。我国劳动力多，农民勤苦耐劳，大部分地区农民有长期积累的精耕细作的经验。
    特别重要的是我国是人民民主国家。农民在改革土地制度之后，正在发展农业合作化，农民的增产积极性提高，农业生产投资增加。由于我国工业的发展，国家给农民的经济援助和技术援助正在不断增长。这些，就能为我国农业的新高涨开辟道路。
    我们具备一切必要的条件来战胜困难，完成计划。我们要发扬艰苦奋斗克服困难的精神，善于利用各种条件去克服困难。
    在今天条件下，完成农业增产计划的决定环节，是积极地有步骤地在自愿互利原则的基础上，依靠贫农，巩固地团结中农，发展农业合作化。五年计划着重提出，第一个五年的农业增产计划，应该特别注意依靠现在的土地入股、统一经营为特点的农业生产合作社，进行适当的初步的技术改良，来发掘农业的潜在力量，提高单位面积的产量。正如李富春副总理的报告中所说的，在目前情况下，“这是一种投资少、收效大、收效快的农业增产办法，又是引导农民走向社会主义的必要步骤。”只要按照第一个五年计划的要求，加强对农民的教育，提高农民的社会主义觉悟，把农民组织起来，一步一步地走向合作化，加上适当的初步的技术改良，我们就能达到增产的目的。
    在五年计划期间，个体农民仍在全国农民中占很大比重，农业的个体经济还有一定的潜在力量，因此必须正确地、充分地发挥个体农民的积极性，增加农业生产。
    为了使得农业增产能和工业的发展相适应，我们必须在农业合作化的基础上采取各项因地制宜的技术措施，充分有效地利用现有耕地，这是今天实现农业增产的主要办法。同时，必须积极地有计划地开垦宜于耕种的荒地，这是解决我国农业增产问题的根本途径。有人怀疑提高现有耕地产量的可能性，提出这样的问题：“现有耕地的增产能力是否已经到顶了，是否会到达它的极限？”其实，这是用不着怀疑的。中国农业生产发展的事实，中国农民保持和提高土壤肥力达到增产的经验，已经作了最生动的回答。马克思说过：如果正确地对待土地，土地就会不断地改良。苏联的经验更加证明了社会主义制度有建立合理的农业制度的一切可能性，这种制度使得土地肥沃程度不断提高，保证农业生产能达到最高的生产率。今天应该做的是根据五年计划的规定，很好地利用现有耕地，提高单位面积产量。
    为使农业增产能和工业的发展相适应，对农业各个部门、各种主要作物、各个不同的农业地区，必须进行全面的安排，抓住重点，大力经营，以推动农业的全面发展。
    各个地区应该根据当地的具体情况和经验，定出本地方农业增产的五年计划，对农业、畜牧业、水产业均须有通盘增产的规划。
    在农作物方面，对于粮食作物和技术作物要作合理安排，在不影响粮食增产的条件下，利用全国各地区的不同条件，适当地扩大技术作物的面积。在粮食方面，要提倡扩大高产作物的种植。在经济作物方面，要大力增产棉花、油料、麻类等。要特别抓紧粮食增产，这是各种农业生产的基础。因为粮食增加了，就能充分供给经济作物区的农民所需的粮食，使他们能够放手增产棉花、麻类、油料、糖料、烟叶、茶、丝等等，就能充分供应畜牧业所需要的饲料，推动畜牧业的发展。粮食生产的高涨，使我们更有把握地促进其他各种农产品以及农业的其他部门生产的高涨。
    对华南热带和亚热带的自然条件要充分加以利用，在完成粮食增产任务的前提下，要大力发展这些地区利于生长的国家和人民需要的经济作物。对华北若干低产粮区要采取有效措施，减轻灾害，发挥地力，使产量能够稳定，并逐步提高。
    为使农业增产能和工业的发展相适应，我们要善于运用国家的经济援助和技术援助，使这些援助真正同广大农民群众的增产措施相结合，达到增产的目的。五年计划中所列的我们国家对农民的经济援助和技术援助，是我国历史上空前未有的，如果好好地加以利用，将在农业增产上发挥极大的作用。这里要求各地在采取各项增产措施时，必须根据当地的气候特点和土壤特点，根据当地各种农作物的种植条件，因地制宜，才能获得良好效果。
    为使农业增产能同工业的发展相适应，我们必须加强农业科学研究工作，即在原有基础上大力改进，继续提高，逐步做到有计划地有组织地总结农民经验，研究和解决农业增产中各项迫切要求解决的具体问题，切实为国家的农业增产服务，为促进农业合作化服务。国营农场必须在增产节约方面，加强示范作用，以推动广大农民。
    各地农村的国家工作人员应该集中力量去领导农业生产，充分发挥地方的积极性和群众的积极性，是完成农业增产任务的重要保证。
    第一个五年计划是中国共产党和中华人民共和国国家机关领导全国人民为实现过渡时期总任务而奋斗的带有决定意义的纲领，为了实现我国的社会主义工业化的事业，我们必须努力为实现第一个五年计划中的农业增产计划而奋斗。
