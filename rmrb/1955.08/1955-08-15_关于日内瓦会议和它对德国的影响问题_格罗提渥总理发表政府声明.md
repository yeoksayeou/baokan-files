Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 13th: Premier Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic delivered a government statement at the eighth session of the People's Chamber on August 12th.

In his statement, Grotewohl first addressed the significant meaning of the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference. He pointed out that this conference was a turning point in the relations between the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. The conference demonstrated that the "policy of strength" would not lead to positive results and was not a solution to international problems, including the German question. However, the Adenauer government was still attempting to solve the German problem with a "policy of strength."

Grotewohl pointed out that German unification could only be achieved in a Europe where security had been reliably guaranteed. He criticized and rejected the Western countries' proposal in Geneva to drag a unified Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union. He believed that the Soviet proposal on European security was the path to reunifying Germany into a peaceful and democratic country.

Grotewohl pointed out that the restoration of German unity required the joint efforts of the four major powers and the German people. The German question must be resolved with the participation of the Germans. German unification can only be restored on the premise of closer ties between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, and with full consideration of the interests of the German Democratic Republic and its internal and external stance. The working people of the German Democratic Republic will never give up the fruits of their ten years of hard work. The rule of monopoly capitalists and large landowners should also be ended in West Germany.

Grotewohl then pointed out the prerequisites for restoring German unification. He pointed out that taking broad measures to ease international tensions was one of these prerequisites, and the establishment of a European collective security system was the most important of these measures. Easing international tensions through the establishment of a collective security system would inevitably lead to the abolition of the Paris Treaties and the North Atlantic Treaty, thereby removing a major obstacle on the road to restoring German unification. Another prerequisite is to take measures for direct rapprochement between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany internally. In this regard, the following measures should be taken first: First, gradually ease the tensions existing between the two parts of Germany; second, expand economic and trade ties between the two Germanys; third, comprehensively promote the development of cultural relations between the two Germanys; fourth, improve transportation facilities between the two Germanys for residents and create the necessary prerequisites for such transportation.

Grotewohl said that the government of the German Democratic Republic is ready to hold negotiations with the relevant authorities in West Germany at any time to resolve these issues or discuss other proposals.

Grotewohl also talked about the issue of all-German elections. He pointed out that after the ratification of the Paris Treaties, truly free and democratic elections could only be held in all of Germany after security had been guaranteed and the threat of German imperialists using elections to achieve aggressive aims had been eliminated.

Grotewohl spoke with satisfaction about the results of the talks between the Soviet government delegation and the government of the German Democratic Republic after the Geneva Conference.

Grotewohl said that the government of the German Democratic Republic welcomes the Soviet proposal to establish normal diplomatic, trade, and cultural relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. The normalization of relations between these countries will help ease tensions and promote rapprochement between East and West. It is now time for the West to abandon its policy of not recognizing the existence of the German Democratic Republic.

Grotewohl pointed out that the tasks of the German people, especially the people of the German Democratic Republic, after the Geneva Conference are: to intensify the struggle against the implementation of the Paris Treaties; to strive for the cessation of the "Cold War" between the two parts of Germany, and to strive for the establishment of normal and friendly relations between East and West Germany in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life, and to strive for the cessation of slander against the German Democratic Republic; to promote the comprehensive development of relations between the residents of East and West Germany, especially the establishment of contacts between the organizations of the working class, and the establishment of contacts between the governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany; to comprehensively consolidate and strengthen the German Democratic Republic as a bulwark of the German people's struggle for peace, security, and reunification.

Grotewohl finally stated that the Geneva Conference has clearly stipulated that German representatives are allowed to participate in the upcoming Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. The government of the German Democratic Republic will do everything possible to promote the success of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. In this regard, all-German proposals should be formulated, and such proposals should be presented in Geneva together with representatives from West Germany. However, if the Bonn government continues to adhere to the anti-national view against the participation of German representatives, the government of the German Democratic Republic will represent the interests of the German people alone in Geneva.

    关于日内瓦会议和它对德国的影响问题
    格罗提渥总理发表政府声明
    新华社柏林十三日电  德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥八月十二日在人民议院第八次会议上发表了政府声明。
    格罗提渥在声明里首先谈到日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的重要意义。他指出，这个会议是苏、美、英、法四国之间关系的转折点。会议表明：“实力政策”不会导致积极结果，不是解决包括德国问题在内的国际问题的办法。而阿登纳政府却还企图用“实力政策”来解决德国问题。
    格罗提渥指出德国的统一只有在安全已经得到可靠保障的欧洲才能实现。他斥责和拒绝了西方国家在日内瓦提出的要把统一的德国拖入北大西洋公约组织和西欧联盟的建议，而认为苏联提出的关于欧洲安全的建议才是把德国重新统一为一个和平民主的国家的道路。
    格罗提渥指出，恢复德国的统一要四大国和德国人民共同努力。解决德国问题，必须有德国人参加。只有在德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国接近的前提下，在充分考虑到德意志民主共和国的利益以及它的对内和对外的立场的情况下，才能恢复德国的统一。德意志民主共和国劳动人民永远不会放弃他们十年努力的果实。在西德也应当结束垄断资本家和大地主的统治。
    格罗提渥然后指出了恢复德国统一的先决条件。他指出：采取缓和国际紧张局势的广泛措施是这些先决条件之一，而建立欧洲集体安全体系则是其中最主要的措施。通过建立集体安全体系来缓和国际紧张局势必然会导致巴黎协定和北大西洋公约的废除，从而消除恢复德国统一道路上的一个主要障碍。另一个先决条件是采取德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国在德国内部直接接近的措施。在这方面，应该首先采取下列措施：一，逐步缓和德国两个部分之间存在的紧张局势；二，扩大两个德国之间的经济和贸易联系；三，全面促进两个德国之间文化关系的发展；四，为居民改善两个德国之间的交通设备以及为这种交通创造必要的前提。
    格罗提渥说，德意志民主共和国政府准备随时同西德有关机关举行谈判，来解决这些问题或是讨论其他的建议。
    格罗提渥还谈到全德选举问题。他指出，在巴黎协定批准之后，只有在安全得到保障并且消除德国帝国主义者利用选举达到侵略目的的威胁以后，才能在全德国举行真正自由、民主的选举。
    格罗提渥满意地谈到日内瓦会议后苏联政府代表团同德意志民主共和国政府会谈的结果。
    格罗提渥说，德意志民主共和国政府欢迎苏联提出的苏联同德意志联邦共和国建立正常的外交、贸易和文化关系的建议，这些国家的关系的正常化将有助于消除紧张局势，促进东西方的接近。现在已经是西方放弃他们不承认德意志民主共和国的存在的政策的时候了。
    格罗提渥指出，日内瓦会议后德国人民，特别是德意志民主共和国人民的任务是：加紧斗争，反对实施巴黎协定；争取停止德国两个部分之间的“冷战”，争取德国东部和西部在政治、经济、文化生活各方面建立正常的友好关系，争取停止对德意志民主共和国的诽谤；促进全面发展东、西德居民之间的关系，特别是建立工人阶级的组织之间的接触，建立德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国两国政府之间的接触；全面巩固和加强作为德国人民争取和平、安全和恢复统一的斗争的堡垒——德意志民主共和国。
    格罗提渥最后表示：日内瓦会议已经明确规定允许德国代表参加将要举行的四国外长会议。德意志民主共和国政府将竭尽一切努力，促进四国外长会议成功。在这方面，应该拟定全德国的主张，并且同西德代表一道在日内瓦提出这种主张。但是，如果波恩政府继续坚持反对德国代表参加的反民族观点，德意志民主共和国政府就将单独在日内瓦代表德国人民的利益。
