Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 15th—The Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture held a banquet on the evening of the 13th to bid farewell to the Chinese Cultural Delegation, which is about to leave Indonesia. Indonesian Second Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Minister of Education and Culture, Hasano Tjokroaminoto, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Education and Culture, Hutaso, many Indonesian government officials and cultural figures, as well as ambassadors and diplomatic officials from various countries to Indonesia, attended the banquet.

    In his speech at the meeting, Hasano said that in the past month and a half, the Chinese Cultural Delegation provided the Indonesian people with the opportunity to appreciate outstanding artistic performances of a high standard. The Indonesian people have since gained a deeper understanding and respect for the merits of Chinese culture and art.

    Hasano said that the friendly relations between Indonesia and China can be traced back to the 7th century. This friendly relationship was interrupted when Indonesia lost its independence in the 16th century. Only after the establishment of the Republic of Indonesia was this friendly relationship restored and has become increasingly close in recent years.

    Hasano said that this visit by the Chinese Cultural Delegation will make the relationship between the two countries even closer.

    On behalf of the Ministry of Education and Culture, Hasano expressed his gratitude to the Chinese Cultural Delegation and the government of the People's Republic of China for this visit, and presented the Chinese Cultural Delegation with an oil painting and some exquisite Indonesian handicrafts on behalf of the Indonesian government.

    Zheng Zhenduo, head of the Chinese Cultural Delegation, expressed his gratitude to Indonesian President Sukarno, the Indonesian government, and the people for the friendly hospitality and cordial reception that the Cultural Delegation received during its month-and-a-half visit to Indonesia. He said that the success of the Chinese Cultural Delegation's visit and performances was inseparable from the help and care of its hosts.

    Zheng Zhenduo said that the enthusiasm, wisdom, and diligence of the Indonesian people, as well as their hatred of colonialism and their love of peace, have left a deep impression on the Chinese Cultural Delegation. Zheng Zhenduo said that while the delegation introduced Chinese art to Indonesia, it also took this opportunity to learn singing and dancing from Indonesian artists. He said: This is a good start for more cultural exchanges in the future, which will further promote mutual understanding and friendship between the two countries.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 15th—Zheng Zhenduo, head of the Chinese Cultural Delegation, and Zhou Erfu, deputy head of the delegation, paid a farewell visit to Indonesian Vice President Hatta on the morning of the 13th, accompanied by Huang Zhen, Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to Indonesia.

    On the same morning, they also paid a visit to Indonesian Second Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Minister of Education and Culture, Hasano Tjokroaminoto.

    At noon on the same day, the Chinese Cultural Delegation went to the University of Indonesia, where a gift-giving ceremony was held. The Chinese Cultural Delegation presented the first collection of ancient Chinese opera series, comprising 124 volumes, to the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture.

    Zheng Zhenduo said at the ceremony that in China, people love drama very much and attach great importance to classical drama. Zheng Zhenduo expressed the hope that this collection of drama selections will help promote cultural exchanges between China and Indonesia.

    Secretary-General of the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture, Hutaso, expressed his gratitude on behalf of the Indonesian government. He said that the gift from the Chinese Cultural Delegation will be given to the University of Indonesia for use by students studying Chinese literature.

    Professor Priyono, Dean of the Faculty of Arts of the University of Indonesia and winner of the Stalin International Peace Prize, accepted the books. He also thanked the Chinese Cultural Delegation on behalf of the University of Indonesia.

    我文化代表团向印度尼西亚副总统等辞行
    新华社雅加达十五日电　印度尼西亚文教部十三日晚举行宴会，欢送即将离开印度尼西亚的中国文化代表团。印度尼西亚第二副总理兼文教部代理部长哈苏诺·佐克罗阿米诺托、文教部秘书长胡塔索、许多印度尼西亚政府官员和文化界人士、以及各国的驻印度尼西亚使节和外交官员出席了这次宴会。
    哈苏诺在会上致词说，在过去一个半月中，中国文化代表团使得印度尼西亚人民获得了欣赏有高度水平的卓越的艺术表演的机会。印度尼西亚人民从此更加深刻地了解和尊重中国的文化和艺术的优点。
    哈苏诺说，印度尼西亚和中国之间的友好关系可以追溯到第七世纪。这种友好关系在十六世纪印度尼西亚丧失了它的独立时中断了。只是在印度尼西亚共和国建立以后，这种友好关系才得到恢复，并且在最近几年来越来越密切。
    哈苏诺说，中国文化代表团这次访问将使得两国之间的关系更加密切。
    哈苏诺以文教部代理部长的名义为这次访问向中国文化代表团和中华人民共和国政府表示感谢，并且代表印度尼西亚政府向中国文化代表团赠送了一幅油画和一些精致的印度尼西亚手工艺品。

    郑振铎说，印度尼西亚人民的热情、智慧和勤劳以及他们对殖民主义的憎恨和对和平的热爱，给中国文化代表团留下了深刻的印象。郑振铎说，代表团一方面把中国的艺术介绍给印度尼西亚，一方面也借这一机会向印度尼西亚艺术家们学习了歌唱和舞蹈。他说：这是在将来进行更多的文化交流的良好开端，这种交流将进一步促进两国之间的相互了解和友谊。
    新华社雅加达十五日电　中国文化代表团团长郑振铎和副团长周而复十三日上午在中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇的陪同下，拜会了印度尼西亚副总统哈达，向他辞行。
    他们在同一天上午还拜会了印度尼西亚第二副总理兼文教部代理部长哈苏诺·佐克罗阿米诺托。
    同一天中午，中国文化代表团到印度尼西亚大学，在那里举行了一个赠礼的仪式。中国文化代表团将包括有一百二十四册的中国古本戏曲丛刊第一集赠给印度尼西亚文教部。
    郑振铎在仪式上说，在中国，人们非常喜爱戏剧，并且十分重视古典戏剧。郑振铎表示希望这套戏剧选集将有助于促进中国和印度尼西亚之间的文化交流。
    印度尼西亚文教部秘书长胡塔索代表印度尼西亚政府表示感谢。他说，中国文化代表团的礼物将给予印度尼西亚大学，以便供研究中国文学的学生应用。
    印度尼西亚大学文学院院长、斯大林国际和平奖金获得者普里约诺教授接受了这批书籍。他并且代表印度尼西亚大学向中国文化代表团致谢。
