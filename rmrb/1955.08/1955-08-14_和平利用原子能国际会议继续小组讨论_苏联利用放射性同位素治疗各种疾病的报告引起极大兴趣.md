Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 13th. According to TASS: On the fifth day of the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy—August 12th—after concluding the general discussion, delegates began a more detailed discussion of research on atomic energy and its applications in various economic sectors. The discussion is continuing in the panel sessions.

At the meetings of the Physics and Reactor Panel, the construction of various types of reactors was discussed. Soviet scientists presented a report by Academician Alikhanov and others on an experimental heavy water physics reactor. Soviet engineer Nikolaev and Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences Kruzhilin respectively gave reports on the design of an experimental thermal neutron nuclear reactor and on the construction and operation of a reactor for physical and technical research.

The Chemistry, Metallurgy, and Technology Panel meetings discussed the chemistry of fission products. Soviet scientists presented three reports.

At the meetings of the Biology and Medicine Panel, the discussion on reports on the use of radioactive isotopes in medicine continued.

In addition to the panel meetings, other activities at the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy include: an exhibition, screenings of popular science films on various aspects of atomic research and the peaceful uses of atomic energy, and lectures by famous scientists from the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries on the issues discussed at the conference. These activities provide scientists attending the conference with the opportunity to learn about the achievements of various countries in atomic research and the peaceful uses of atomic energy, and help them exchange experiences.

Xinhua News Agency: The International Scientific and Technical Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy continued its panel meetings on the afternoon of the 11th. The Biology and Medicine Panel meeting attracted a large audience. The first report was by Soviet scientist Kozlova on the experience of the Soviet Union in using certain radioactive isotopes in medical treatment. Her report pointed out that Soviet medical institutions have been using radioactive isotopes to treat various diseases. Isotopes are most effective in the treatment of malignant and benign tumors. Among the various radioactive isotopes used for medical purposes in the Soviet Union, the most commonly used are radioactive cobalt, phosphorus, iodine, and gold.

Because radioactive isotopes are supplied centrally to a large medical network, and because medical assistance is free and available to everyone, it is possible to conduct clinical observations on a large number of patients in a relatively short period. Through observation and many experimental studies, it has been possible to evaluate various methods of treating diseases with radioactive isotopes.

Before the use of radioactive isotope therapy, substances used for light therapy were mostly radium, radium-mesothorium, and various X-rays. Since the acquisition of radioactive cobalt, one of the primary tasks of scientific research institutions has been to compare it with natural radioactive substances and study its physical properties and the characteristics of its biological effects. Studies have been conducted to understand the characteristics of cobalt's biological effects in normal and pathological tissues, especially in tumor tissues. The report said that the Soviet Union has used radioactive cobalt to treat a large number of patients with malignant tumors in the skin, mucous membranes of the mouth, tonsils, maxilla, nasal cavity, pharynx, esophagus, lungs, breasts, etc. The results proved that its therapeutic effect, whether at the time or later, was no worse than the results of using natural radioactive substances. For example, the Kharkov Institute of X-ray Radiology and Radiology treated 450 patients with cancer on the skin of the eyelids, and the cure rate was 94 percent, without any complications due to treatment. The effectiveness achieved by the National Gertsen Oncological Scientific Research Institute in treating 1,552 patients with various malignant tumors with cobalt-60 was not only no worse than the effectiveness obtained by treatment with natural radioactive substances, but in some cases even improved the cure rate.

The use of radioactive phosphorus to treat tumors of the eyelids and cornea (external irradiation) can cure the disease without damaging the visual organs, whereas previously only surgical operations were used to treat these diseases.

The report continued, modern hospitals widely use various irradiation therapies in the treatment of many diseases of the blood system. The Soviet Ministry of Health has established many specialized institutions (blood transfusion institutions and stations in all republic centers and state cities), which study the etiology, pathology, clinical science, and treatment of blood system diseases. Soviet scientists are seeking the most effective ways to combine the use of radioactive phosphorus with other methods to treat blood diseases in scientific research. Special observations are made on patients treated with radioactive phosphorus. The Blood Transfusion Research Institute and the X-ray Radiology and Radiology Institute have statistically and systematically compiled materials from Soviet medical institutions on treatment results, and based on the materials obtained, drafted instructions on the use of radioactive phosphorus in hematology.

The report concluded that, based on the experience of Soviet scientists in medical radiology, conclusions can be drawn about the value and prospects of using radioactive isotopes in medical treatment.

After the report, many slides were shown to the audience, introducing the successful use of radioactive isotopes in the Soviet Union to treat serious illnesses, especially diseases such as lung cancer, laryngeal cancer, and facial cancer.

Kozlova's report aroused great interest, and scientists attending the report meeting raised a series of questions, expressing great interest in certain parts and details of the Soviet medical community's experience in using radioactive isotopes.

    和平利用原子能国际会议继续小组讨论
    苏联利用放射性同位素治疗各种疾病的报告引起极大兴趣
    新华社十三日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：在和平利用原子能国际会议的第五天——八月十二日，代表们在结束了一般性讨论以后，进入了比较仔细地讨论有关原子能的研究和在各种经济部门中的应用的问题。讨论正在各小组会议上继续进行。
    在物理和反应堆小组的会议上，讨论了关于各种类型反应堆的构造问题。苏联科学家提出了阿利哈诺夫院士等人的关于实验性的重水物理反应堆的报告。苏联工程师尼古拉耶夫和克鲁日林通讯院士分别作了关于实验性的热中子核子反应堆的设计的报告和关于供物理和技术研究用的反应堆的构造和工作的报告。
    化学、冶金和工艺小组会议讨论了分裂产品的化学问题。苏联科学家提出了三个报告。
    在生物学和医学小组的会议上，继续讨论关于在医学上使用放射性同位素的报告。
    和平利用原子能国际会议目前除了举行小组会议外，其他的活动还有：展览会，放映关于原子研究的各方面与和平利用原子能的普及科学影片，苏联、美国、英国等国著名科学家就会议上讨论的问题发表演讲等。这些活动给参加会议的科学家们提供了学习各国在原子研究与和平利用原子能方面取得的成就的机会，并且帮助他们交流经验。
    据新华社讯　和平利用原子能国际科学技术会议十一日下午继续举行小组会议。在生物学和医学小组会议上聚集了大量听讲的人。第一个报告是苏联科学家科兹洛娃关于苏联在医疗方面采用某些放射性同位素的经验的报告。她的报告指出，苏联医疗机构已在用放射性同位素治疗各种疾病。在治疗恶性赘瘤和良性赘瘤的时候使用同位素作用最大。在苏联用于医疗目的的各种放射性同位素中，最常用的是放射性的钴、磷、碘和金。
    由于放射性同位素是集中供应给广大的医疗网的，由于医药援助是免费和人人都能获得的，所以有可能在比较短的时期内对大量的病人进行临床观察。经过观察和许多次的实验性研究，已经有可能对各种用放射性同位素治病的方法作出评价。
    在采用放射性同位素治疗法以前，用于光疗的物质多是镭、镭—中钍以及各种爱克司光射线。自从获得了放射性钴以后，科学研究机关的首要任务之一就是将它同天然的放射性物质相比较，研究它的物理性质和生物学作用的特性。已经进行过研究，了解钴在正常组织和病理组织，特别是在肿瘤组织中的生物学作用的特点。报告说，苏联已经用放射性钴医治了大量在皮肤、嘴的黏膜腔、扁桃腺、上颌、鼻腔、咽喉、食道、肺部、乳腺等处患有恶性肿瘤的病人。结果证明，它的治疗效果无论在当时或以后来看，都不比利用天然放射性物质的结果要差。例如，哈尔科夫爱克司光射线学和放射学研究所在治疗过眼睑皮肤生有癌症的四百五十名病人，结果治愈的人占百分之九十四，并且没有由于治疗关系而产生并发症。国立格尔钦肿瘤学科学研究所用钴六十治疗一千五百五十二名患有各种恶性赘瘤的病人所取得的成效，不但不差于利用天然放射性物质进行治疗所得的成效，而且在某些情况下甚至还提高了治愈的百分率。
    利用放射性磷治疗眼睑和角膜等的赘瘤（外部照射）能够治愈而不损害视力器官，而从前治疗这些疾病时只动用外科手术。
    报告接着说道，现代医院在治疗血液系统的许多疾病中广泛采用各种照射治疗法。苏联卫生部设立了许多专门机构（在所有共和国中心和州的城市设立输血机构和站），这些机构研究病源学、病理、临床学和治疗血液系统疾病的问题。苏联科学家在科学研究工作中寻求利用放射性磷的最有效方法同其他方法结合起来以治疗血液的疾病。对经过放射性磷治疗的病人进行特别的观察。输血研究所以及爱克司光射线学和放射学研究所统计并且系统地整理了苏联各医疗机关治疗结果的材料，根据所获得的材料，草拟了关于在血液学中采用放射磷的指示。
    报告最后说，根据苏联科学家在医疗放射学方面的工作经验，可以得出关于在医疗中采用放射性同位素的价值和前途的结论。
    在报告之后，为听众放映了许多幻灯片，介绍在苏联成功地采用放射性同位素治疗重病，特别是治疗诸如肺癌，喉癌和脸面癌等病的情况。
    科兹洛娃的报告引起了极大的兴趣，出席报告会的科学家提出了一系列问题，他们很关心苏联医学界利用放射性同位素的经验的某些部分和细节。
