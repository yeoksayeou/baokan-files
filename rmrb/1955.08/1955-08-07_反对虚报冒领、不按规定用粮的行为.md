    Oppose False Reporting, Illegal Collection, and Non-Compliant Grain Usage
    To the Editor:
    The Huailai County Grain Bureau recently conducted an inspection of grain usage in all county-level agencies, organizations, industrial and mining enterprises, and the food industry, and discovered that the phenomenon of some units falsely reporting, illegally collecting, and being generous in theory but tight in practice is very serious. For example, the Babaoshan Mining Area falsely reported its headcount every month from January to May this year, illegally collecting more than 4,000 catties of grain. The Second Staff Living Supply Section of the Fourth Engineering Bureau of the New Railway Engineering Headquarters of the Ministry of Railways illegally collected hundreds of thousands of catties of grain from January to May by over-reporting the number of people. This practice not only disrupted the state's grain supply plan, but also condoned the waste of grain, and even allowed bad elements to take the opportunity to profiteer from state grain purchases.
    The inspection also revealed the phenomenon of food processing and replication industries purchasing excessive amounts of grain. For example, the Shaticheng Supply and Marketing Cooperative Noodle Processing Factory took advantage of the opportunity of the supply and marketing cooperative acting as an agent for the state in managing grain, and arbitrarily purchased more than 70,000 catties of grain from January to May. The Nanshuiquan Supply and Marketing Cooperative Food Processing Factory used more than 10,000 catties of flour than the state-stipulated amount from January to May.
    In addition, the phenomenon of wasting grain in some units is also very serious. For example, the Babaoshan Mining Area canteen makes each steamed bun half a catty in weight and each bowl of rice five taels of rice. The Shaticheng Brick Factory canteen serves at least one catty of rice per serving. Therefore, there is a lot of leftover rice or discarded steamed buns in these two canteens. In the dining hall of Huailai County Junior High School, there are leftover cornbread on every table; there are many rice noodles, tofu, steamed buns, and rice in the school's swill bucket. According to preliminary calculations, the first canteen of the Guanting Reservoir wastes 9.6 catties of grain every day, and someone at the Hydropower Office canteen even feeds white flour steamed buns to donkeys.
    The above situation shows that continuing to deeply publicize the importance of saving grain and supervising all units to eliminate the phenomenon of wasting grain is still a problem worthy of attention at present.

### 反对虚报冒领、不按规定用粮的行为

    反对虚报冒领、不按规定用粮的行为编辑同志：
    怀来县粮食局最近对全县各机关、团体、工矿企业和食品业的用粮情况进行了一次检查，发现某些单位虚报冒领，宽打窄用的现象很严重。例如八宝山矿区从今年一月到五月每月都虚报人数，冒领四千多斤粮食。铁道部新建铁路工程总局第四工程局第二职工生活供应段从一月到五月用多报人数的办法冒领了几十万斤粮食。这种做法不仅打乱了国家的粮食供应计划，而且纵容了浪费粮食的行为，甚至还使坏分子能够乘机套购国家的粮食。
    这次检查中还发现了食品加工、复制业中有着多购粮食的现象。像沙城镇供销社粉条加工厂从一月到五月利用供销合作社给国家代营粮食的机会，擅自多买粮食七万多斤。南水泉供销社食品加工厂一月到五月所用的面粉，就超过国家规定用量一万多斤。
    此外，某些单位浪费粮食的现象也很严重。例如八宝山矿区食堂每个馒头有半斤重，每碗饭有五两米，沙城砖厂食堂每份饭起码是一斤，因此这两个食堂里出现了不少剩饭或扔掉的馒头。怀来县初级中学的饭厅里，每个饭桌上都有吃剩下的窝头；这个学校的泔水缸里，有不少粉条、豆腐、馒头和米饭。官厅水库第一食堂据初步计算每天要浪费九斤六两粮食，水电处食堂还有人拿白面馒头喂驴子。
    以上情况说明，继续深入地宣传节约粮食的重要意义，监督所有单位杜绝浪费粮食的现象，在目前还是一个值得重视的问题。  高巨峰
