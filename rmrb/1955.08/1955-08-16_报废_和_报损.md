“Scrapping” and “Reporting Loss”
	Kǒng Sāng
	The Heilongjiang Daily published a sketch on August 9th, the gist of which is as follows: From October of last year to March of this year, sugar beets lost from the Heping Sugar Factory were continuously discovered in the lower reaches of the Ashi River. The workers of the Heping Sugar Factory told the factory director about this situation, but the factory director never dealt with it. When the production period ended in April of this year, he casually listed more than 9,000 tons of lost sugar beets in the production report and submitted the report to the Provincial Department of Industry. After the Provincial Department of Industry sent people to inspect and discovered the cause of the loss, the factory director still didn't care: "It's nothing, at most I'll write a self-criticism!"
	The result of this matter is still unknown, but it is certain that such a serious event of damaging national wealth should not and will not be "ended with writing a self-criticism." Let's not talk about this issue for the time being. What attracts people's attention is another question: Why is it that more than 9,000 tons of sugar beets were lost—these sugar beets require farmers to cultivate diligently for a year on 609 hectares of land, with a purchase cost equivalent to 360,000 yuan, and can produce more than 900 tons of sugar—yet there was no fear at all, and it was openly reported in a list?
	The answer to this question is a long story. In industrial production enterprises, there is often a situation called "scrapping," which means that defective products are produced and do not count. There is even a factory that produced for a whole year last year, and all the products were substandard, and they have to be repaired again this year. In state-owned commercial and cooperative commercial systems, there is also often this situation: some goods are bitten by mice, some goods deteriorate and become moldy, and some goods are leaked and scattered during transportation. What to do? There are also two words: "report loss," which means that they are lost and need to be written off. There are similar situations in other departments and other units. In all these cases, some have been dealt with: either the parties concerned are required to compensate, or the parties concerned are given other punishments, which is absolutely necessary. But in more cases, it is "reported" and then "cancelled," neither Zhang San nor Li Si, but the state bears the loss.
	"Scrapping" and "reporting loss" cannot be completely avoided, of course, because in some cases the loss of materials cannot be overcome by human power; or although human power can overcome it, it is temporarily damaged due to lack of experience. Therefore, the state has separately stipulated quotas for "scrap" and "loss," and stipulated that certain losses can be "reimbursed," which is completely appropriate. But some people want to exploit this loophole, and the director of the Heping Sugar Factory is one of them. He can usually ignore the loss of sugar beets, and at the end of the period, he can casually sign a report because he is thinking that he can "get reimbursed" anyway.
	The newspaper once exposed a river of oil, and today there is another river of sugar beets, and the loss events of mouse bites and insect damage that we hear and see every day are even more numerous. What relationship do these losses have with natural disasters? What relationship do they have with lack of experience? For these losses, of course, neither should they be "scrapped" nor should they be "reported as loss." Therefore, it should not be "reimbursing" the state for these things that have been lost by people, but rather letting those who lost the things bear full responsibility: the director of the Heping Sugar Factory should be severely punished; all other people who waste national wealth for no reason should also be made to learn a lesson. And all leading departments should also plug the loopholes, so that no one can exploit the loophole of "reimbursement."

### “报废”和“报损”

    “报废”和“报损”
    孔桑
    八月九日黑龙江日报刊载了一篇小品文，大意如下：去年十月到今年三月，在阿什河下游不断发现由和平糖厂流失的甜菜。和平糖厂的工人将这情况告诉厂长，厂长一直不加处理，到今年四月生产期结束时，他漫不经心地在生产情况报告表中列入损失甜菜九千多吨，就把报告送交省工业厅了。省工业厅派人检查并发现了损失的原因以后，这位厂长还满不在乎：“没啥，满大劲写个检讨到头啦！”
    这件事的处理结果现在还不知道，但是可以肯定，对这种严重损害国家财富的事件，决不应该也不会是“写个检讨到头”了的。这里姑且不谈这个问题。引起人们注意的，倒是另外一个问题：为什么流失了九千多吨甜菜——这些甜菜需要农民在六百零九垧土地上辛勤耕种一年，按收购成本折合三十六万元，可产九百多吨食糖——竟然毫无恐惧之心，公然列表上报呢？
    这个问题说来就话长了。在工业生产企业中，常常有一种情况，叫作“报废”，就是生产了废品，不作数了。甚至有这样一个工厂，去年整整生产了一年，产品全部不合格，今年还得重新修理。在国营商业和合作社商业系统中，也常常有这种情况：某某商品被老鼠咬了，某某商品变质霉烂了，还有些商品在运输途中漏撒了，怎么办呢？也有两个字：“报损”，就是损失了，需要一笔勾销。在其它部门和其它单位中，也有类似的情况。凡此种种，有一些是有处理结果的：或者让当事人赔偿，或者给当事人其它处罚，这是完全必要的。但是在更多情况下，却是一“报”就“销”，既不是张三、也不是李四，而是由国家担负了损失。
    “报废”和“报损”，当然不能完全避免，因为在某些情况下的物质损失，并非人力所能克服的；或者人力虽可克服，但因经验不足而暂时仍遭损害。因此国家分别规定了“废”和“损”的定额，规定了某些损失是可“报销”的，这是完全应该的。但是某些人却想钻这个空子，和平糖厂厂长就是其中的一个。他平日可以对甜菜的损失不闻不问，到期可以漫不经心在报告上签一个字，都是因为想着反正可以“报销”。
    报上曾经揭露过一条石油河，今天又有一条甜菜河，平日我们耳闻目睹的鼠咬虫蛀的损失事件则更多。这些损失和天灾有何关系呢？和经验不足又有何关系呢？对于这些损失，当然既不应“报废”也不应“报损”。因此，不应该是向国家“报销”这些被人损失了的东西，而应该是让那些损失了东西的人来担负全部责任：和平糖厂的厂长应该受到严重处分；一切其它无端浪费国家财富的人，也都应该使之得到一定的教训。而所有领导部门，也应该堵住漏洞，不让一个人能钻“报销”的空子。
