    Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau Blindly Builds Reservoirs, Causing Huge Waste
    To the Editor:
    The Shimen Reservoir project, constructed by the Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, is a relatively large undertaking with complex construction techniques. However, the Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau started construction blindly without conducting preliminary surveys or producing a technical design. As a result, it caused a huge waste of manpower and resources.
    At the end of last year and the beginning of this year, tens of thousands of migrant workers and staff members concentrated on the construction site, working diligently. They dug the diversion canal when it was freezing, cleared the turf on the ground covered with thick snow, and also cleared the foundation, excavated trenches, and quarried stone. However, when these preparatory works were basically completed, the geological drilling team conducted drilling at the location originally designed (actually, estimated) for the dam axis foundation, and the results showed that it was not suitable for dam construction. Other hydrological and geological data were also incomplete. For example, the catchment area and the area of benefited farmland were not accurately surveyed. To avoid even greater losses, the project was finally forced to stop in March of this year.
    This incident caused extremely serious losses. According to preliminary checks, the waste of labor and material costs amounted to more than 139,000 yuan. The temporary sheds erected, telephone lines, and specially repaired roads were also scrapped or partially scrapped. A large amount of materials stored for this project are still stockpiled. If, in the future, reservoirs cannot be built in this area due to geological reasons, the waste will be even more alarming.
    The Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau's casual attitude towards reservoir construction projects is simply intolerable. The Ministry of Water Resources and the Hubei Provincial People's Committee should seriously handle this matter and give the personnel involved the punishment they deserve.

### 湖北省水利厅盲目修建水库造成巨大浪费

    湖北省水利厅盲目修建水库造成巨大浪费编辑同志：
    湖北省水利厅修建的石门水库工程较大，施工技术也比较复杂。但是湖北省水利厅没有进行初步勘探，没有编出技术设计，就盲目兴工了。结果，造成了人力、物力的巨大浪费。
    在去年年底和今年年初，几万民工和工作人员集中在工地上辛勤地劳动着。他们在结冰的时候挖通引河，在铺满厚雪的地上清除草皮，并且清基抽槽、开石方。但是，等到这些准备工作基本完成的时候，地质钻探队才在原设计（实际上是估计）修建大坝坝轴基础的地方进行钻探，结果发现这里不宜于筑坝。至于其他水文、地质资料也不齐全，例如对于承雨面积、受益田亩都没有进行精确的调查。为了避免更大的损失，这项工程终于被迫在今年三月停止了。
    这件事造成了极为严重的损失。根据初步检查，浪费的工料费就达十三万九千多元。架设的临时工棚、电话线路和专修的公路也都报废或部分报废了。为这项工程而贮备的大批材料至今还积压着。如果今后因为地质关系不能在这一带修筑水库，浪费就更加惊人了。
    湖北省水利厅对待水库修建工程，采取这样草率的态度，实在是不能令人容忍的。水利部和湖北省人民委员会应该严肃处理这件事情，并给有关人员以应得的处分。
