The example of the socialist country, the Soviet Union, points out a bright, civilized, and happy future for the Albanian people and the people of various people's democratic countries who are building socialism according to the Soviet model and with Soviet assistance.

Our country, like all people's democratic countries, has made tremendous achievements in the economic and cultural fields during these years of people's power, thanks to the help of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Our economic achievements have promoted the growth of the material welfare and cultural level of our people. Comrade Hoxha said: "The lives of our people have improved, our people are living better, and the conditions for education are also better. The current welfare of our people is as different from the past as day and night. The lives of our people are improving day by day."

The material and cultural living standards of our working people are primarily determined by the national income. As Stalin pointed out: under the socialist system, "the distribution of national income is not for the enrichment of the exploiting classes and their numerous parasitic servants, but for the continuous improvement of the material life of workers and peasants and the expansion of socialist production in urban and rural areas." In 1954, our national income increased by 50 percent compared to 1951.

The total wages of our workers and staff increased by 50 percent in 1950 compared to 1947, and this year it will reach twice that of 1950. From 1950 to 1954, prices have been reduced repeatedly. In 1954 alone, residents benefited more than 300 million leks as a result of the third price reduction. In addition, appropriations for social welfare undertakings have also played a significant role in improving the material and cultural conditions of the working people.

With the improvement of the material conditions of the working people, their cultural level has also been greatly improved.

Our culture, based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, is developing in accordance with the example of advanced Soviet culture. Our culture is a new culture with socialist content and national form. It is fundamentally different from the culture that served the exploiting classes, aristocrats, and capitalists in the old society. Our culture belongs to the broad masses of working people. Inspired by the ideas of Lenin and Stalin and the principles of proletarian internationalism, it serves our country's socialist construction. Its purpose is to cultivate new socialist people.

In the past, culture was the exclusive possession of the ruling class, but now our culture is the wealth of the broad working people and the masses.

Compared with 1938, the number of students in our primary schools has increased by 262.64 percent this year, and the number of students in seven-year schools and secondary schools has increased by 765.3 percent. The primary school network has been extended to the most remote villages. Primary education has become compulsory education. The Party and the government are also striving to implement seven-year compulsory education throughout the country (seven-year compulsory education is currently only implemented locally in areas where conditions are already in place and where there are seven-year schools). The Party and the government pay great attention to the struggle against illiteracy left over from the old system. This year, illiteracy will be eliminated among all residents under the age of 40. Before liberation, 80 percent of the country's residents were illiterate.

Albania now has six universities, and this year it has trained its first batch of engineers, agronomists, and teachers. Our country has also made significant achievements in establishing various scientific and cultural institutions. For the first time, our country has established a scientific research institute, which is developing and making science serve the cause of socialist construction and serving the masses.

In the ten years since liberation, the cultural center network has expanded in a way that is simply incomparable to the past.

In 1938, there were only five public libraries in total, with only tens of thousands of books, some of which were harmful to the working people; now, there are eleven local libraries and a national library in the capital, with hundreds of thousands of books in total (excluding small district libraries and reading rooms distributed in labor centers and rural areas).

In the past, there were no cultural centers or reading rooms. Now, all provincial and district centers have cultural centers, and all district centers and large villages have reading rooms.

In 1939, there were only seventeen film projectors in the whole of Albania, but now there are one hundred and twenty-three. Film is the most popular art form among the masses. Our people especially love to watch excellent and educational films from the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries. Albania has now established its own film industry. The "New Albania" Film Studio has been built, and it is an excellent creation of architectural art equipped with the latest Soviet machines. To date, the film studio has produced dozens of newsreels and short documentaries. It is also preparing to shoot some large-scale films. In the near future, some feature films will also be produced. Albanian feature films, such as the Soviet-Albanian co-production "Skanderbeg" (translator's note: i.e., "The Great Warrior") and documentaries such as "New Albania" and "Glorious Ten Years," have been screened in Albania and many other countries and have achieved great success.

In the past, literary and artistic activities were limited to a few cities. Speaking of music, in 1939 there were a total of six orchestras, three choirs, and eight instrumental ensembles, all of which were engaged in amateur literary and artistic activities. There were no professional literary and artistic groups at that time. Now, the number of amateur literary and artistic groups is incomparable to any time in the past. In 1954, 4,040 art groups participated in the music and dance competition, with a total of 42,415 participants.

The Albanian Music Theatre was established in 1950. It includes a choir, orchestra, ballet troupe, and a national small opera and dance troupe. The Music Theatre has made remarkable achievements in a short period of time, especially in ballet, an art that was previously unknown in our country. The Music Theatre has performed some classical works, such as "The Fountain of Bakhchisarai," "Notre Dame de Paris," "The Vilia," "Ivan Susanin," and the Albanian opera "Dawn" (by Albanian composer Christo Kono), which prove how great achievements have been made in this regard.

In the past, the development of drama was very poor because the reactionary rulers at that time did not care about the development of dramatic art at all. During the National Liberation War, the Albanian Communist Party paid full attention to the educational role of drama, which led to the establishment of the first literary and artistic group of the National Liberation Army. In May 1945, the first professional troupe, the People's Theatre, was formed around the main theatrical core of the National Liberation Army.

Following its own fighting traditions and the example of Soviet art, and with the valuable and vigorous help of K. A. Ivanovich, a meritorious actor of the Russian Federation and a Soviet art director, the People's Theatre has now achieved a series of successes. Our stage has staged excellent Soviet and domestic scripts, as well as classical plays by Gogol, Moliere, and Shakespeare, which have promoted the education of the masses and improved their artistic appreciation. Not long ago, the People's Theatre also successfully performed the Chinese opera "The White Haired Girl." In addition to this central professional theater, there are now such theaters in the cities of Korça, Shkodër, and Durrës.

The fine arts have also developed greatly, especially in recent years. The works of our painters and sculptors introduce to the people our people's heroic past, the glorious struggle for liberation, and their peaceful labor in the cause of building socialism. The Fine Arts Exhibition commemorating the tenth anniversary of liberation alone featured sixty-six works by thirty-one authors.

In order to train art cadres, a specialized art school was opened in Tirana as early as 1946, with departments of music, painting, sculpture, and drama. In order to better lead all the activities of the actors, to unite them in a unified organization, and to provide assistance in their education, the Actors' Association has been established with the support and care of the Labor Party.

This great progress in our cultural and educational undertakings proves that under the leadership of the Party, we are smoothly carrying out the cultural revolution in accordance with the Soviet model, which is one of the important conditions for building socialism.

The improvement of the material and cultural living standards has continuously increased the creative initiative and production enthusiasm of the working masses. They see that the more developed and advanced the country's economy and culture are, the better and wealthier their lives will be. This is also one of the reasons why all the working people in our country are full of vigor and labor enthusiasm in the cause of building socialism.

### 阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民物质和文化生活水平的提高

    阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民物质和文化生活水平的提高
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国教育和文化部文艺司司长  弗拉诺·雅科瓦
    社会主义国家苏联的榜样，给正在按照苏联的范例、并在苏联帮助下建设社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚人民和各人民民主国家人民指出了光辉、文明和幸福的未来。
    我国也像所有人民民主国家一样，在人民政权的这些年里，由于有苏联和各人民民主国家的帮助，在经济和文化方面取得了巨大的成就。我们的经济成就促进了我国人民物质福利和文化水平的增长。霍查同志说过：“我国人民的生活改善了，我们的人民生活得更好了，受教育的条件也更好了。我国人民现在的福利状况跟过去比起来，就像白天和黑夜那样不同。我国人民的生活在一天天地改善着。”
    我国劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平首先决定于国民收入。正如斯大林所指出的：在社会主义制度下，“国民收入的分配不是为了剥削阶级及其为数众多的寄生仆役发财致富，而是为了不断提高工农的物质生活和扩大城乡社会主义生产。”一九五四年我国国民收入已比一九五一年增加了百分之五十。
    我国工人和职员的工资总额一九五○年比一九四七年增加了百分之五十，而在今年，它将达到一九五○年的二倍。从一九五○年到一九五四年，已经一再降低了物价。仅仅在一九五四年，由于第三次降低物价的结果，居民就获益三亿里克以上。除此以外，社会福利事业的拨款也对改善劳动人民的物质和文化条件起了显著的作用。
    随着劳动人民物质条件的改善，他们的文化水平也大大地提高了。
    以马克思列宁主义原则为基础的我国的文化，正在按照先进的苏维埃文化的榜样向前发展。我们的文化是具有社会主义内容和民族形式的新的文化。它根本不同于在旧社会为剥削阶级、贵族老爷和资本家服务的文化。我们的文化是属于广大劳动群众的。它在列宁、斯大林的思想和无产阶级国际主义原则的鼓舞下，为我国的社会主义建设事业服务。它的目的是培养社会主义的新人。
    在过去，文化是统治阶级的独占物，而现在，我们的文化是广大劳动者、人民群众的财富。
    以今年同一九三八年相比，我国初等学校学生的人数已增加了百分之二百六十二点六四，七年制学校和中等学校学生的人数已增加为百分之七百六十五点三。初等学校网已扩展到最远的乡村。初等教育已成为义务教育。党和政府也力求在全国推行七年义务教育（现在仅在条件已经具备和有七年制学校的地方局部实行七年制义务教育）。党和政府十分注意同旧制度遗留给我们的文盲现象作斗争。今年将在全部居民中扫除四十岁以下的文盲。而在解放以前，全国百分之八十的居民都是不认识字的。
    现在阿尔巴尼亚有六所大学，并且已在今年培养出了第一批工程师、农艺师和教师。我国在建立各种科学和文化机关方面也取得了显著的成绩。我国第一次建立了科学研究所，它正在发展并使科学为社会主义建设事业服务，为群众服务。
    在解放后的十年中间，文化中心网扩大得简直无法同过去相比了。
    一九三八年时，总共只有五个公共图书馆，只有几万册书，有些书还是对劳动者有害的；而现在，计有十一个地方图书馆和首都的一个国立图书馆，这些图书馆共有数十万册书（小型的区立图书馆和分布在劳动中心和农村的阅览室除外）。
    过去根本没有文化馆和阅览室，现在所有的省和区的中心都有文化馆，所有的区中心和大村庄都有阅览室。
    在一九三九年，全阿尔巴尼亚总共只有十七部电影放映机，而现在已有一百二十三部。电影是群众最爱好的艺术，我国人民特别爱看苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的优秀的、富有教育意义的影片。现在阿尔巴尼亚已创立了本国的电影事业。“新阿尔巴尼亚”电影制片厂已经建成，它是用最新式的苏联机器装备起来的建筑艺术的优秀创作。到目前为止，电影制片厂摄制了数十部新闻片和短纪录片。它也准备摄制一些大型影片。最近的将来，也要摄制一些艺术片。阿尔巴尼亚的艺术片，如苏阿共同摄制的“斯坎德培”（译注：即“伟大的战士”）以及“新阿尔巴尼亚”和“光荣的十年”等纪录片，都曾在阿尔巴尼亚和许多国家放映过，并获得了巨大的成就。
    在过去，文艺活动仅限于几个城市。谈到音乐，在一九三九年共有六个乐队、三个合唱团和八个器乐团，它们都从事业余文艺活动。专业文艺团体当时是根本没有的。而现在，业余文艺团体的数目是过去任何时候也无法比拟的。一九五四年，有四千零四十个艺术小组参加了音乐舞蹈比赛，参加人数共达四万二千四百一十五人。
    阿尔巴尼亚音乐剧院是一九五○年建立的。它包括有合唱队、乐队、巴蕾舞剧团和一个国立小型歌舞剧团。音乐剧院在短期内就取得了显著的成就，特别是在巴蕾舞方面，这种艺术过去在我国是陌生的。音乐剧院曾演出过一些古典作品，如“巴赫切萨拉伊喷泉”、“巴黎圣母院”、“女妖”、“伊凡·苏萨宁”以及阿尔巴尼亚的歌剧“曙光”（阿尔巴尼亚作曲家克里斯托·科诺的作品）等，这些都证明在这方面取得了多么巨大的成就。
    在过去，戏剧的发展是很差的。因为当时的反动统治者根本就不关心戏剧艺术的发展。在民族解放战争时期，阿尔巴尼亚共产党对戏剧的教育作用给予了充分的重视，这促使建立了民族解放军的第
  一个文艺团体。一九四五年五月，围绕着民族解放军的主要戏剧核心组织成立了第一个职业剧团——人民剧院。
    人民剧院遵循着自己的战斗传统和苏联艺术的榜样，在苏联艺术导演、俄罗斯联邦功勋演员克·安·伊凡诺维奇的可贵的大力帮助下，现在已取得了一系列的成就。我们的舞台上演出了苏联的和本国的优秀剧本，也演出了果戈理、莫里哀、莎士比亚的古典剧等，这些演出促进了群众的教养并提高了他们的艺术鉴赏力。不久前，人民剧院还成功地演出了中国的歌剧“白毛女”。除了这个中央职业剧院以外，现在在科尔察、斯库台和都拉斯等城市也有这种剧院。
    造型艺术也得到了巨大的发展，特别是在最近几年。我们的画家和雕塑家的作品，向人们介绍了我国人民的英勇的过去，争取解放的光荣斗争，以及他们在建设社会主义基础的事业中的和平劳动。仅在解放十周年造型艺术展览会上展出的，就有三十一个作者的六十六件作品。
    为了培养艺术干部，早在一九四六年就在地拉那开办了一所艺术专门学校，内设音乐、绘画、雕塑、戏剧等系。为了更好地领导演员们的一切活动，为了把他们团结在一个统一的组织中并在他们的教育方面给以帮助，已在劳动党的支持和关怀下建立了演员协会。
    我国文化教育事业的这种巨大进步证明：我们正在党的领导下，按照苏联的范例顺利地进行着文化革命，这是建设社会主义的重要条件之一。
    物质和文化生活水平的提高，使劳动群众的创造主动性和生产积极性不断增长。他们看到：国家的经济和文化越发达和越前进，他们的生活也就越好和越富裕。这也正是我国全体劳动人民在建设社会主义的事业中充满着蓬勃朝气和劳动热情的原因之一。
