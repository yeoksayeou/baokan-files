　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 26th: Syngman Rhee, in a statement on the evening of the 25th, once again clamored for the continuation of the current demonstrations in South Korea against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission until Syngman Rhee's group's "friends" and it jointly "remove" the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and jointly "recover" the areas south of the 38th parallel controlled by the Korean and Chinese sides. Syngman Rhee said that he considers the trend toward easing tensions and peaceful coexistence to be "dangerous."

　　Syngman Rhee revealed in his statement that he is helping the United States create excuses for disrupting the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's plan. He said that since the demonstrations began, "Koreans believe they are helping the United States." They anticipate that the demonstrations will provide the United States with a "completely legitimate reason" to "withdraw" the Polish and Czechoslovak members from South Korea.

　　Under the guidance of Syngman Rhee's policy, demonstrations against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission have been blatantly carried out throughout South Korea. The demonstrations in Seoul, where the South Korean government is located, have recently become more frequent. On the same day that Syngman Rhee issued his statement, under the direction of the Syngman Rhee group's puppet organization, the "Korean Taxi Association," taxi drivers in Seoul were forced to drive three hundred taxis in a demonstration on the streets against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. After the demonstration, the association issued certificates to the drivers, saying that they had participated in the demonstration. At the same time, about one hundred and fifty veterans coerced about three hundred students to hold similar demonstrations.

　　According to the US Eighth Army, demonstrators in Gunsan tried to break into the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission camp seventeen times on the evening of the 24th. On this day, thousands of thugs surrounded the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission residence in Busan all day. In other ports, groups of thugs continued to make trouble.

　　李承晚集团叫嚣反对中立国监察委员会
    新华社平壤二十六日电　李承晚在二十五日晚发表声明，再次叫嚣要把南朝鲜目前的反对中立国监察委员会的示威继续下去，直到李承晚集团的
  “朋友”和它一道“清除”中立国监察委员会波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员，并且和它一道“收复”三八线以南的朝中方面控制的地区。李承晚说，他认为走向缓和紧张局势和和平共处的趋势是“危险”的。
    李承晚在声明中透露，他是在帮助美国为破坏中立国监察委员会的计划制造借口。他说，自从示威行动开始之后，“朝鲜人就认为他们是在帮助美国”。他们预料示威行动将为美国提供一种“完全正当的理由”，使波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员从南朝鲜“撤走”。
    在李承晚这种方针的指导下，南朝鲜各地的反对中立国监察委员会的示威一直在明目张胆地进行。南朝鲜政府所在地的汉城的示威活动，最近又转趋频繁。在李承晚发表声明的同一天，根据李承晚集团御用团体“朝鲜出租汽车联合会”的指示，汉城的出租汽车司机被迫驾驶三百辆出租汽车在大街举行反对中立国监察委员会的示威。在示威之后，这个联合会就发给司机以证明，说他们已经参加了示威。同时，约一百五十名退伍军人胁迫约三百名学生也举行了同类的示威游行。
    据美国第八军宣布，群山的示威者在二十四日晚曾经先后十七次想冲进中立国小组的营地。这一天，成千的暴徒整天包围了在釜山的中立国小组住地。在其他口岸也有成群的暴徒不断捣乱。
