Xinhua News Agency, August 24th dispatch from Bucharest: According to TASS, Bucharest's Stalin Square was filled with a festive atmosphere on August 23rd. Countless flags fluttered in the breeze. Above the reviewing stand and the grandstands hung the national emblem of the Romanian People's Republic, portraits of Lenin and Stalin, and portraits of members of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as well as leaders of the Romanian Workers' Party and the state. A banner read: "August 23rd."

　　At nine o'clock in the morning, leaders of the Romanian Workers' Party and the government, headed by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee Khrushchev, and the heads of government delegations from the people's democracies, ascended the reviewing stand, at which point the entire audience burst into warm applause.

　　The parade commander, First Deputy Minister of the Romanian Armed Forces, Lieutenant General Sălajan, inspected the troops by car. He then went to the rostrum to deliver a speech celebrating the holiday. After the speech, a salute was fired, and the band played the national anthems of Romania and the Soviet Union. The square echoed with a magnificent cry of "Hurrah!"

　　The parade's march-past began. Cadets from Romanian military academies, infantry, sailors, and border guards marched past the reviewing stand in neat formations. Following them were mechanized units and tank units. Jet planes flashed across the sky above the square. At this moment, waves of cheers resounded in the square.

　　Then, the mass procession began. At the front of the procession were armed workers' units who had participated in the fight to overthrow the fascist dictatorship. Subsequently, the youngest participants in the parade—happy Romanian children—marched across the square to the sound of horns and drums. Behind them were representatives of the working people from eight districts of Bucharest. They held high flags and portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and the leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Romanian Workers' Party, and other fraternal communist and workers' parties. Workers held high charts and models illustrating production achievements. Slogans, songs, and cheers rose and fell in the square.

　　The demonstration parade of the working people of Bucharest lasted for more than three hours.
