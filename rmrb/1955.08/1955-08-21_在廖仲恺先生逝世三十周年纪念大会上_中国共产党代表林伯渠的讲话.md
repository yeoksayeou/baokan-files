Comrades, friends:

　　In the history of China's modern democratic revolution, Mr. Liao Zhongkai stands out as a close comrade-in-arms of the great Sun Yat-sen, and after Sun Yat-sen's death, as a representative of the revolutionary democrats who upheld Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three Great Policies of "alliance with the Soviet Union, learning from Russia," "assisting peasant and worker movements," and "alliance with the Communist Party." Because Liao Zhongkai insisted on and continued Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary ideas, he was assassinated by imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries less than half a year after Sun Yat-sen's death. Today marks the 30th anniversary of Mr. Liao Zhongkai's death, and we express our heartfelt condolences and respect to this outstanding democratic revolutionary.

　　Standing at the forefront of the surging tide of the Chinese Great Revolution was the Chinese working class. Since the establishment of the Chinese working class's political party—the Chinese Communist Party—it immediately put forward the proposal to organize a national democratic united front and first established contact with the revolutionary democrats headed by Sun Yat-sen. At that time, it was Mr. Liao Zhongkai who represented Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary democrats in contacting the Soviet representatives. Mr. Liao Zhongkai became an activist and organizer of practical work for Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary democrats. Under the direct leadership of Sun Yat-sen, and with the participation of members of the Chinese Communist Party, the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang, was actively organized by Mr. Liao Zhongkai. At that time, the reactionaries within the Kuomintang stubbornly resisted Sun Yat-sen's democratic revolutionary program and openly opposed Sun Yat-sen's Three Great Policies. It should be pointed out that Sun Yat-sen did not compromise with these reactionaries, and the one who supported Sun Yat-sen most strongly was precisely Mr. Liao Zhongkai. Mr. Liao Zhongkai assisted Sun Yat-sen in preparing for the Whampoa Military Academy and also assisted Sun Yat-sen in reorganizing the Kuomintang. The revolutionary democrats within the Kuomintang, led by Sun Yat-sen and Liao Zhongkai, maintained good cooperative relations with working comrades of the Chinese Communist Party. But the struggle was extremely arduous. Guangzhou, as a revolutionary base, was subject to the covert instigation and open interference of imperialism, while internally it was filled with warlords, feudal landlords, and comprador bourgeois agents who were constantly attempting to subvert the revolution. In order to maintain the revolutionary base and implement the revolutionary Three Great Policies, the only way out was to rely on the broad peasant and worker movements to unite workers and peasants around the revolutionary regime and to rely on Soviet assistance. Mr. Liao Zhongkai was a firm executor of this revolutionary policy.

　　At the time of Sun Yat-sen's death, the national people's revolutionary movement was advancing rapidly. In Guangzhou, the revolutionary base, revolutionary democrats, supported by the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party, were engaged in a sharp, close-quarters struggle with counter-revolutionaries attempting to subvert the revolutionary base. After Sun Yat-sen's death, the heavy responsibility of supporting and implementing the revolutionary Three Great Policies fell on Mr. Liao Zhongkai's shoulders. Mr. Liao Zhongkai fulfilled his combat mission and shed his last drop of blood for it. Until Mr. Liao Zhongkai's death, Communist Party members could still openly operate in the Whampoa Military Academy and the revolutionary army, the famous Hong Kong general strike was able to continue, and peasant associations and peasant self-defense forces were widely established throughout Guangdong. All of this was closely related to Mr. Liao Zhongkai's resolute implementation of the revolutionary Three Great Policies.

　　Imperialism, the feudal landlord class, the comprador bourgeoisie, and counter-revolutionary elements hidden in the revolutionary base formed a reactionary alliance, attempting to use despicable assassination to strike at the revolutionary democrats and use this as a preliminary step to openly oppose the Communist Party, subvert the revolutionary regime, and overthrow the revolutionary Three Great Policies. At nine o'clock in the morning on this very day thirty years ago, counter-revolutionary elements set up an assassination network at the entrance of the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters and assassinated Mr. Liao Zhongkai. A noteworthy fact is that the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee was scheduled to hold a routine meeting that day, but when Mr. Liao Zhongkai and his wife, Ms. He Xiangning, arrived at the meeting place, no one else was there except the murderers deployed by the counter-revolutionaries. Even Wang Jingwei, who usually arrived early, "didn't make it" from his "residence," and Chiang Kai-shek deliberately hid in Whampoa and didn't come to Guangzhou. Today, Hu Yisheng (i.e., Hu Hanmin's brother), who directly organized the murderers to carry out the assassination, is still receiving preferential treatment from Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan. Exactly half a year after Mr. Liao Zhongkai was assassinated, Chiang Kai-shek launched the fabricated "Zhongshan Warship Incident" on March 20, 1926, and proposed to remove all responsible personnel of the Chinese Communist Party from the Central Party Headquarters, the Whampoa Military Academy, and the army, completely seize military power, and gradually transform this revolutionary army into a counter-revolutionary army.

　　Later, Chiang Kai-shek relied on the reactionary army and secret service organization to launch a full-scale attack on the revolution, committing all kinds of traitorous and harmful deeds to the people.

　　Looking back now, what deserves our vigilance is that although the revolutionary democrats at that time were able to continue to hold high the banner of the revolutionary Three Great Policies, they did not recognize the need to severely suppress internal counter-revolution to consolidate the revolutionary regime. Before August 20, 1925, although the revolutionary democrats had long known about the counter-revolutionaries' conspiracy to assassinate, they did not make up their minds to suppress counter-revolutionary activities. Even after Mr. Liao Zhongkai was assassinated, the revolutionary democrats, despite repeated urgings from the Chinese Communist Party and the people, were unwilling to bring the counter-revolutionaries to justice and punish them according to law. After Mr. Liao Zhongkai was assassinated, the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters held a memorial service in Guangzhou, and many of those who attended the memorial service were involved in the assassination case. The person in charge of the Guangzhou National Government at that time "cherished" the "friendship" with these counter-revolutionaries and meticulously protected those with blood on their hands, even "politely escorted" these counter-revolutionaries abroad or "cheerfully sent them off" to Shanghai. Subsequent history proved that they were originally a gang; they were originally the people's most vicious enemies.

　　But the despicable assassination and counter-revolutionary conspiracy failed to stop the torrent of the people's great revolution. In the thirty years since the deaths of Sun Yat-sen and Liao Zhongkai, China has undergone great changes. The great cause of the Chinese revolution that Sun Yat-sen and Liao Zhongkai were unable to complete has been brilliantly completed by the people's great revolution led by the Chinese working class and its political party—the Chinese Communist Party. The path of history can only be the path guided by Marxism-Leninism. The Chinese people, tempered by three great revolutions and four revolutionary wars, are now standing up heroically. Under the leadership of the great Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party firmly unites the 600 million Chinese people, shakes off the shackles of imperialism and feudalism, and is striving to build a new socialist China. The united front, led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, and including all democratic parties, democratic classes, and other patriotic democratic people, is even more consolidated. The People's Republic of China is becoming increasingly prosperous and strong. The unbreakable friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is becoming the central force in defending world peace and the cause of people's democracy. The imperialist conspiracy to sabotage the People's Republic of China and seize the sacred territory of the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, will surely continue to fail, just like the past thirty years of the failed history of imperialist interference in the Chinese revolution. Taiwan will surely be liberated. The Chinese people who have stood up will unite like a giant, support the great Chairman Mao, support the great Chinese Communist Party, and march towards the glorious goal of victory—socialism. The end of the people's enemies is also destined by history. A bunch of pests who hate the revolution, hate the people, sabotage the revolution, and murder Mr. Liao Zhongkai and thousands upon thousands of Chinese revolutionary martyrs, no matter where they flee to the ends of the earth, will one day be judged by the people.

　　Comrades! Friends! The founding of the People's Republic of China was achieved through bloody struggle, and our glorious five-star red flag is stained red with the blood of countless martyrs over the decades. Among them are many patriots like Mr. Liao Zhongkai and Mr. Zhu Zhixin, old members of the Tongmenghui, close comrades-in-arms of Sun Yat-sen, millions of heroic Communist Party members, revolutionary fighters, and revolutionary masses, and countless heroic soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. We must use all our strength to defend our country, defend our socialist construction, defend our beautiful rivers and mountains, and defend the beautiful future of our generation and the young next generation. We must unite the people of the whole country to fight for the liberation of Taiwan and to thoroughly complete the great socialist cause in our country. We must unite with the great Soviet Union, all people's democratic countries, and peace-loving people all over the world to fight for the defense of world peace.

　　Victory will surely belong to us! No reactionary force in the world can stop the advancing force of the people's masses led by the working class. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people will firmly complete all the goals of the socialist revolution. The revolution must achieve a complete victory, and the counter-revolution must be completely eliminated. This is our best commemoration of Mr. Liao Zhongkai.

### 在廖仲恺先生逝世三十周年纪念大会上　中国共产党代表林伯渠的讲话

    在廖仲恺先生逝世三十周年纪念大会上
　　中国共产党代表林伯渠的讲话诸位同志、诸位朋友：
    中国近代民主主义革命家中，作为伟大的孙中山先生的亲密战友，在孙中山先生逝世以后，又作为坚持孙中山的“联合苏联，以俄为师”，“扶助农民运动和工人运动”，“联合共产党”的革命的三大政策的革命民主派的代表人物，是廖仲恺先生。廖仲恺由于坚持和继续了孙中山的革命主张，在孙中山先生逝世以后不到半年，便被帝国主义和国民党反动派暗杀了。今天恰是廖仲恺先生逝世的三十周年，我们对这位杰出的民主主义革命家表示衷心的悼念和敬意。
    站在中国大革命的澎湃浪潮前列的，是中国工人阶级。自从中国工人阶级政党——中国共产党成立之后，便立即提出了组织民族民主统一战线的主张，并首先同以孙中山先生为首的革命民主派建立联系。当时，代表孙中山革命民主派和苏联代表进行接触的，就是廖仲恺先生。廖仲恺先生成为孙中山革命民主派的活动家和实际工作的组织者。在孙中山先生直接领导下，并有中国共产党党员参加在内的中国国民党第一次代表大会，就是由廖仲恺先生积极参与组织的。在当时，国民党内部的反动派顽固地抗拒了孙中山的民主革命纲领，并且露骨地反对孙中山先生的三大政策。应该指出，孙中山先生对这些反动派并没有妥协，而支持孙中山先生最力的正是廖仲恺先生。廖仲恺先生协助孙中山先生筹办了黄埔军校，还协助孙中山先生改组了国民党。以孙中山、廖仲恺为首的国民党内的革命民主派，和中国共产党员的工作同志们维系着良好的合作关系。但是斗争是异常艰苦的。作为革命根据地的广州，外有帝国主义的阴谋策动和露骨的干涉，内部却充满着随时企图颠覆革命的军阀、封建地主阶级和买办资产阶级的代理人。为要维持革命根据地并贯彻革命的三大政策，唯一的出路就是依靠广泛的农民运动和工人运动来团结工人、农民在革命政权的周围，并依靠苏联的帮助。廖仲恺先生就是这个革命政策的坚决执行者。
    在孙中山先生逝世的时候，正是全国人民革命运动突飞猛进的时候。而在革命根据地的广州，也正是得到苏联和中国共产党支持的革命民主派，和企图颠覆革命根据地的反革命派进行短兵相接的尖锐斗争的时候。在孙中山先生逝世以后，代表革命民主派来支持和贯彻革命三大政策的重担，就落在廖仲恺先生肩上。廖仲恺先生执行了他的战斗任务，并为此流了他最后的一滴血。直到廖仲恺先生逝世以前，黄埔军校和革命军队中仍能有共产党员公开活动，著名的香港大罢工得以维持下去，在广东各地普遍建立了农民协会与农民自卫军，这都是和廖仲恺先生坚决执行革命三大政策有密切关系的。
    帝国主义、封建地主阶级、买办资产阶级和隐藏在革命根据地中的反革命分子，结成了反动联盟，企图采取卑鄙的暗杀手段来打击革命民主派，并以此作为公开反对共产党、颠覆革命政权、推翻革命的三大政策的先行步骤。就在三十年前的今天上午九时，反革命分子在当时的国民党中央党部门口布置了暗杀网，暗杀了廖仲恺先生。值得一提的事实，就是当天应该是国民党中央常务委员会开例会的，而当廖仲恺先生和他的夫人何香凝先生赶到会场的时候，除了反革命分子布置的凶手以外，什么人也没有到，就连平常照例提前到会的汪精卫，也在“公馆”里“没有赶上”，而蒋介石则故意地躲在黄埔没有到广州。今天，直接组织凶手进行暗杀的胡毅生（即胡汉民的弟兄），还在台湾受着蒋介石的优厚待遇。廖仲恺先生被暗杀后恰恰半年，蒋介石就在一九二六年三月二十日发动了一手捏造的所谓“中山舰事变”，并提出要将所有中国共产党的负责人员由中央党部、黄埔军校和军队中清除出去，将军队的实权完全掌握在自己手中，并把这支革命的军队一步一步地变成为反革命的军队。
    后来，蒋介石便凭借着反动军队和特务组织全线地向革命进攻，做尽了一切卖国殃民的罪恶勾当。
    现在回顾起来，值得我们警惕的，就是当时的革命民主派虽然能够继续举起革命三大政策的大旗，但对必须严厉镇压内部反革命来巩固革命政权这一点，是没有认识的。革命民主派在一九二五年八月二十日以前，虽然早已得知反革命分子布置暗杀的阴谋，但并没有下决心去镇压反革命的活动。在廖仲恺先生被暗杀以后，革命民主派虽在中国共产党和人民群众再三催促下，仍不愿对反革命分子绳以法纪，明正典刑。廖仲恺先生被刺死后，国民党中央党部在广州举行了追悼会，而参加追悼会的很多人就同暗杀案件有关。当时广州国民政府的负责人“怀念”着同这些反革命分子的“友谊”，关怀备至地保护了那些手染鲜血的人，甚至把这些反革命分子“礼送”出国，或“欢送”出上海，以后的历史证明了，原来他们是一伙的，他们本来都是人民最凶恶的敌人。
    但是卑鄙的暗杀手段和反革命阴谋，并没有能够阻挡人民大革命的洪流。孙中山先生和廖仲恺先生逝世以来的三十年，中国经历了伟大的变化。孙中山、廖仲恺所没有能完成的中国革命的伟大事业，是由中国工人阶级及其政党——中国共产党领导的人民大革命光辉地完成了。历史的道路只能是马克思列宁主义所指引的道路。中国人民经历三次大革命和四次革命战争的磨练，现在是雄壮地站立起来了。中国共产党在伟大的毛泽东同志领导下，坚定地团结着六万万中国人民，摆脱了帝国主义和封建主义的枷锁，并且正在为努力建设社会主义的新中国而奋斗。以工人阶级为领导，工农联盟为基础的，包括各民主党派、各民主阶级以及其他爱国民主人士的统一战线是更加巩固了。中华人民共和国日益兴隆强盛。中华人民共和国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的牢不可破的友谊的日益发展，正在成为保卫世界和平与人民民主事业的中心力量。帝国主义企图破坏中华人民共和国，窃据中华人民共和国的神圣领土台湾的阴谋，也一定会像过去三十年帝国主义干涉中国革命的失败史一样，一定是要继续失败下去的，台湾是一定要解放的。站立起来的中国人民，将会像一个巨人一样团结起来，拥护伟大的毛主席，拥护伟大的中国共产党，向着胜利的光荣目标——社会主义迈进。人民敌人的末路也是历史所注定了的。仇视革命、仇视人民、破坏革命、杀害廖仲恺先生及千千万万中国革命烈士的一群害虫，不管他逃到天涯海角，也总有一天受到人民的裁判。
    诸位同志！诸位朋友！中华人民共和国的缔造是经过流血奋斗的，我们的光荣的五星红旗是数十年来千千万万的无数先烈的鲜血所染红的。其中有不少像廖仲恺先生、朱执信先生一样的爱国者、老同盟会员、孙中山先生亲密的战友，有数以百万计的英勇的共产党员、革命战士和革命群众，有无数的英勇的人民解放军战士。我们必须用我们的全力保卫我们的国家，保卫我们的社会主义建设，保卫我们美好的河山，保卫我们这一代和年青的下一代的美好的未来。我们一定要紧紧团结全国的人民，为解放台湾而斗争，为在我国彻底地完成伟大的社会主义事业而斗争。我们一定要同伟大的苏联，各人民民主国家和全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来，为保卫世界和平而斗争。
    胜利是一定属于我们的。世界上没有任何反动势力可以阻挡以工人阶级为领导的人民大众的前进力量。在中国共产党领导之下，中国人民将坚定地完成社会主义革命的全部目标。革命一定要得到彻底的胜利，反革命一定要彻底地被消灭。这就是我们对廖仲恺先生的最好的纪念。
