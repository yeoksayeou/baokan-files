    New Blasting Method for Geological Exploration Begins to Be Promoted
    The "Center-Excavation Slot-Pulling Blasting Method" created by the production team led by Communist Party member Jiang Wei'san has begun to be tested and promoted in geological exploration teams across the country. Jiang Wei'san's team was responsible for hand-hammer drilling and blasting work in the 404 Geological Exploration Team under the Central South Geological Bureau. After studying the advanced blasting methods of Soviet geological exploration, they created this advanced working method through repeated experiments with the technical personnel of the team. The main feature of this blasting method is that it can utilize the conditions of geological structures to arrange shot positions regularly for drilling and blasting. Therefore, it can increase the tunneling speed of geological exploration by about one time, reduce the consumption of some materials, and enable the hand-hammer drilling and blasting work to be managed in a planned way. The creation of this blasting method ended the chaotic, unplanned, and inefficient state of the old blasting methods.
    Soviet expert Popov gave a high evaluation of the working methods of the Jiang Wei'san team. After calculation, he said: The Jiang Wei'san team can combine geological structure conditions with drilling methods, and the quotas they have created are close to those of Soviet advanced producers.
    The advanced working method of the Jiang Wei'san team is suitable for trench, well, and adit exploration work by geological exploration teams. The Ministry of Geology has sent people to summarize the working methods of the Jiang Wei'san team, and in the second quarter, it has notified geological exploration teams in various regions to test and promote it according to the rock structure conditions, in order to further improve tunneling efficiency. At present, four geological exploration teams in the Central South Region have begun to promote the advanced working methods of the Jiang Wei'san team.

    地质勘探新爆破法开始推广
    共产党员蒋畏三领导的生产小组所创造的“边掏心拉槽爆破法”，已开始在全国地质勘探队中试验推广。蒋畏三小组在中南地质局所属的四零四地质勘探队担任手锤凿岩爆破工作。他们学习了苏联地质勘探的先进爆破方法后，和这个队的技术人员经过多次试验，创造了这种先进工作方法。这种爆破方法的主要特点，是能利用地质构造的条件，有规律地排列炮位，进行凿岩爆破。因此，它可使地质勘探的掘进速度提高一倍左右，并可减少一些材料的消耗，使手锤凿岩爆破工作可以有计划地进行管理。这种爆破方法创造出来后，结束了旧的爆破方法混乱、无计划和效率低的状态。
    苏联专家波波夫对蒋畏三小组的工作方法给了很高的评价。他经过计算后说：蒋畏三小组能把地质构造情况和打眼方法结合起来，他们创造的定额已和苏联先进生产者的定额相接近。
    蒋畏三小组的先进工作方法适用于地质勘探队的槽、井、硐探工作。地质部已派人总结了蒋畏三小组的工作方法，并已在第二季度通知各地质勘探队，根据岩层构造情况试验推广，进一步提高掘进效率。目前，中南区已有四个地质勘探队开始推广蒋畏三小组的先进工作方法。
