　　Xinhua News Agency, August 25th: The internal factional strife within the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is intensifying. Recently, Sun Li-jen, the Chief of Staff of the Chiang bandit government, has been "dismissed." Foreign news agencies report that eight of Sun Li-jen's close aides and about three hundred of Sun's former subordinates have been arrested by Chiang Kai-shek on charges of "plotting subversive incidents" and "spreading discontent."

　　Foreign news agencies report that Sun Li-jen has been under house arrest by Chiang bandit secret agents since May of this year. Currently, Sun Li-jen has been prohibited from meeting anyone or participating in any social activities. Chiang bandit has instructed Chen Cheng, his confidant, to form an "investigation committee" to thoroughly investigate Sun Li-jen, and a series of related arrests are underway.

　　The friction between Sun Li-jen and Chiang bandit and his direct line has a long history. According to Hong Kong and Taiwan reactionary newspapers, as early as the beginning of 1950, although Chiang bandit, at the instigation of his American masters, appointed Sun Li-jen as "Commander-in-Chief of the Army," Sun had no power to transfer or command his subordinates. At that time, Hong Kong reactionary newspapers called Sun Li-jen a "puppet commander," who could not appoint or dismiss a battalion commander without Chiang bandit's consent, nor could he transfer any troops without Chiang bandit's order. Foreign news agencies, in reporting Sun Li-jen's dismissal this time, said that Sun Li-jen had "friction with leading figures of the Kuomintang, especially with Chiang Ching-kuo, the eldest son of Chiang Kai-shek." The news also said that Sun Li-jen's "disagreement with Chiang Kai-shek's eldest son, Chiang Ching-kuo, on the issue of the political commissar system in the armed forces was no longer a secret." In recent years, Hong Kong reactionary newspapers have also frequently revealed news of Sun Li-jen's constant power struggles and quarrels with Chiang Ching-kuo and Chen Cheng. In June 1954, Chiang bandit, citing the reason of "expiration of term," removed Sun Li-jen from the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Army and appointed him Chief of Staff. At that time, Hong Kong reactionary newspapers said that this was a promotion in name but a demotion in reality, relegating Sun Li-jen to an idle post.

　　Foreign news agencies also reported that another important reason for Chiang bandit's dismissal of Sun Li-jen was: after the talks between the United States and the People's Republic of China began in Geneva, Chiang bandit tried to create this incident to bargain with the United States, in order to seek more "US aid" to maintain its bloody rule in Taiwan.

### 蒋贼集团内部倾轧加剧孙立人已被蒋贼“免职”

　　蒋贼集团内部倾轧加剧孙立人已被蒋贼“免职”
    新华社二十五日讯　蒋介石卖国集团内部派系倾轧日益加剧，最近，蒋贼政府的参军长孙立人已被“免职”。外国通讯社报道，有八名孙立人的亲信干部和约三百名孙的旧部军官已被蒋介石用所谓“制造颠覆性事件”和“散布不满情绪”的罪名予以逮捕。
    外国通讯社的消息说，自今年五月以来，孙立人就已经被蒋贼特务软禁起来。目前，孙立人已被禁止会见任何人和参加任何社交活动。蒋贼已指令以其亲信陈诚为首组织“调查委员会”对孙立人进行彻查，与此有关的一系列逮捕正在进行。
    孙立人与蒋贼及其嫡系之间的摩擦由来已久。据港台反动报刊透露，早在一九五○年初，蒋贼在其美国主子的授意下虽任孙立人为“陆军总司令”，但孙没有调动和指挥部属的权力。当时香港反动报纸称孙立人为“木偶司令”，不经蒋贼同意不能任免一个营长，没有蒋贼的命令也不得调动任何部队。外国通讯社在报道孙立人这次被免职的事件时说，孙立人曾和“国民党领导人物发生摩擦，特别是和蒋介石的长子蒋经国不和”。消息还说，孙立人“在武装部队的政治委员制度问题上同蒋介石的大儿子蒋经国意见不一致已经不是秘密了”。香港反动报纸几年来也时常透露孙立人与蒋经国和陈诚之间不断的争夺权势发生争吵的消息。一九五四年六月，蒋贼借“任期届满”的理由免去了孙立人陆军总司令职务，任孙为参军长，当时香港反动报纸说，这是明升暗降，把孙立人贬为闲曹。
    外国通讯社的消息还说：蒋贼黜免孙立人的另外一个重要原因是：当美国和中华人民共和国在日内瓦的会谈开始后，蒋贼设法制造这一事件，借此对美国讨价还价，以求争取更多一些“美援”，来维持它在台湾的血腥统治。
