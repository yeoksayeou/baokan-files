    Conscientiously Study and Research the Motherland's Medicine
    Lu Zhijun

    Wang Bin completely dismissed traditional Chinese medicine, calling it "feudal medicine" and "subjective idealism," which "can only provide psychological comfort, giving peasants the illusion of medical treatment." This statement is neither historically accurate nor reflective of the current situation.

    Throughout the history of Chinese medicine, there have been many outstanding medical practitioners, such as Bian Que, Hua Tuo, Zhang Zhongjing, Wang Shuhe, Huangfu Mi, Ge Hong, Tao Hongjing, Chao Yuanfang, Sun Simiao, Wang Tao, Meng Shen, Qian Yi, Chen Ziming, Li Shizhen, Wu Youke, Wang Qingren, and many others. These medical practitioners included experts in anatomy, pathology, diagnosis, pharmacology, nutrition, internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, pediatrics, acupuncture, and other fields. Their writings are extensive, with over 1,800 types and more than 30,000 volumes collected in Beijing alone. These are the fruits of our ancestors' labor and a very precious cultural heritage. These works prove that many medical discoveries originated in China, such as inoculation, which originated in China and later spread to Europe, where human smallpox was replaced with cowpox. Records of diabetes and tuberculosis, among other diseases, appeared in China more than a thousand years earlier than in Western Europe. Chemical pharmaceutics (i.e., alchemy) also originated in China. Among these works, Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica" has been translated into many foreign languages and circulated in many countries around the world, and it remains an important reference book for scientists studying drug therapies. These many valuable legacies have not been valued by the vast majority of Chinese scientists, especially Western-trained doctors with modern scientific knowledge. While there are many reasons for this, the following factor is undoubtedly important: our Western-trained doctors acquire some knowledge from schools and some knowledge from practical work. In the old society, whether in schools or medical units, due to the influence of bourgeois slavish ideology and sectarianism, the history of the motherland's medicine was not valued and was often distorted (medical schools mostly taught the history of Western European medicine). Therefore, people blindly negated traditional Chinese medicine, calling it "unscientific" and "backward," etc., without understanding that for thousands of years, the Chinese people have relied on traditional Chinese medicine to maintain their health, and now more than half of urban residents and almost all rural residents rely on traditional Chinese medicine to treat diseases. The effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine is significant, and even some diseases that modern medical methods find difficult to treat are often cured by experienced traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. Therefore, this valuable cultural heritage has great practical and research value. We should sort out and promote its rational parts to serve the people's health care. As for the introduction of modern medicine based on natural science into China, it has only been about a century. It has indeed played a significant role in the people's health care, and if it can be combined with Chinese medicine, each taking the best from the other, it will be able to make a greater contribution to the people.

    In recent decades, some Chinese scientists have studied a small number of medicines recorded in the "Compendium of Materia Medica" and confirmed their significant efficacy. As many people know, Changshan can treat malaria, Bai Touweng and Yadanzi can treat dysentery, Danggui can regulate menstruation, Yimucao can treat uterine bleeding, and Binglang, Leowan, Shijunzi, and Kuliupi can expel intestinal parasites. Fritillaria bulbs can stop coughs, Chaihu can curb fever, Corydalis can relieve pain, Eucommia can lower blood pressure, and Ginseng is a highly effective tonic. Acupuncture is a unique therapy in China, which is not only effective for many diseases but also simple and economical, and enjoys great credibility among the people. Recent experience has shown that acupuncture can solve many disease problems that modern medicine finds difficult to deal with. According to a recent report from Beijing Children's Hospital, acupuncture has good efficacy for infantile paralysis and diarrhea, and extremely high treatment effects for tonsillitis and other throat conditions; applying it to obstetrics and gynecology can regulate menstruation. Reports from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region prove that acupuncture also has very good effects on rheumatism and digestive system diseases. If we can conduct further research on it, we will certainly be able to discover many new things. The Chongqing Hemorrhoid and Fistula Treatment Group, working in Beijing, has treated hundreds of hemorrhoid and anal fistula patients in the past year. They applied improved traditional Chinese medicine treatment methods, and patients rarely experienced physical pain or blood loss. Treatment can also be performed during inflammation; hemorrhoid and fistula patients with anemia, old age, or pulmonary tuberculosis can also be treated with this method without causing sequelae such as anal stenosis or incontinence. Therefore, this method is superior to other hemorrhoid and fistula treatments in some respects. The Tangshan Sanatorium conducted experiments on Qigong therapy (similar to sleep therapy but without medication. Patients sit and lie quietly under the guidance of a doctor, and after a certain period, the cerebral cortex gradually restores nerve function due to rest. This method of treating disease and strengthening the body was previously used by Taoists, so people mistakenly regarded it as superstition) and preliminarily proved that the effect is very good. More than 70 patients with difficult-to-treat diseases participated in the experiment, all suffering from common chronic diseases, such as gastroptosis, gastric or duodenal ulcers, as well as long-term insomnia, headaches, seminal emission, etc. Before treatment, Western medical examinations were performed to confirm the diagnosis, and follow-up examinations were performed after recovery. Last year, type B encephalitis was prevalent in Shijiazhuang (undoubtedly diagnosed by science), and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners were invited to participate in the treatment, which reduced the mortality rate (especially for the sequelae of encephalitis, the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine is even more significant). Although the above facts are only a part of traditional Chinese medicine, they fully prove that traditional Chinese medicine has extremely valuable content, which cannot be negated in any way. Therefore, Wang Bin's negation of the value of traditional Chinese medicine is groundless, and in the face of these facts, it only further exposes the essence of his despicable bourgeois ideology. Of course, traditional Chinese medicine is not without its shortcomings. For example, it focuses on experience, some discussions are not perfect enough, and explanations are not thorough enough, which requires us to sort it out, explain it with modern scientific methods, and develop and improve it. This is a glorious and arduous historical task.

    Now that we know that the achievements of traditional Chinese medicine are so brilliant and the efficacy is so significant, we should strive to study and research it. In order to effectively study and research the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, we must first clarify the purpose of learning. Our purpose in learning traditional Chinese medicine is to promote the cultural heritage of the motherland, enrich modern medical science, improve the level of medical technology, and better serve the people's health care. The key to inheriting and carrying forward this valuable heritage lies in Western-trained doctors learning traditional Chinese medicine. This is what the Central Government has long instructed. Western-trained doctors who have mastered certain modern medical theories and have clinical experience, as long as they have an understanding of traditional Chinese medicine and can humbly and sincerely learn from traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, will surely be able to achieve results through long-term cooperation between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. In the past, some Western-trained doctors did some work in learning traditional Chinese medicine and sorting out traditional Chinese medicine, and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners also used new methods to study traditional Chinese medicine and achieved certain results. However, in the process of Western-trained doctors learning traditional Chinese medicine, the following phenomenon often occurs: some regard traditional Chinese medicine as "antiques," believing that traditional Chinese medicine is only a historical relic and has no practical significance; some start from interest, hoping to discover miracles from it in order to gain both fame and fortune; and even some people, such as Yu Yunxiu, study traditional Chinese medicine in order to attack it. Although he conducted so-called research on traditional Chinese medicine for decades and wrote books such as "Theory of Medical Revolution," the content unilaterally emphasized the shortcomings of traditional Chinese medicine and promoted the idea of traditional Chinese medicine being backward and unscientific, etc., negating traditional Chinese medicine, which not only made no contribution to carrying forward the medical heritage but also played a hindering role. The purposes of these people in learning and researching traditional Chinese medicine are all incorrect. And the influence of these people has not been completely eliminated even now. Judging from the recent situation of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners working in hospitals, some Western-trained doctors superficially express their willingness to learn from traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, but in reality, they are doing their own thing; some push certain complex or even hopeless diseases to traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to treat in order to cope with patients (of course, it is appropriate to conduct consultations for some difficult and complicated diseases); some deliberately make things difficult for traditional Chinese medicine practitioners; some units invite traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and set up traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis and treatment departments, and the administrative leaders think that "the task is completed" and do not designate anyone to lead them. These are all formalistic learning methods that must be corrected as soon as possible.

    How to learn and research traditional Chinese medicine is a new question. I think it can be approached from two aspects. On the one hand, it is to study traditional Chinese medicine books. But there are too many books, and many are repetitive or similar. It is best to first select several basic works for in-depth study, such as "Huangdi Neijing," "Shanghan Lun," "Jinkui Yaolue," and "Compendium of Materia Medica." However, the language of these books is not easy to understand, and you can ask traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to explain them. But sometimes it is difficult for the people explaining to popularize it, and we must patiently listen and think about it in connection with clinical practice. You can also refer to some annotated works, especially those works that have been sorted out by some traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in recent decades. In order to facilitate Western-trained doctors to learn traditional Chinese medicine, some people have asked to unify the names of diseases. This is certainly a good thing, but it cannot be done for a while. Because although certain disease names are the same in traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, their meanings are often different. For example, the "Shanghan Lun" of traditional Chinese medicine includes a variety of febrile diseases. If we interpret it as Western medicine's "enteric typhoid" (or intestinal fever), then it would be totally irrelevant. Therefore, we must not use Western medicine's diagnostic disease names to force a fit. A common language (terminology) between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine can only be obtained through long-term practice. Recently, local traditional Chinese medicine journals have conducted some research in this area, which can be used as a reference for everyone. If you want to study a certain specialty of traditional Chinese medicine, in addition to studying general traditional Chinese medicine books, you can also put effort into traditional Chinese medicine specialty books. But more important is clinical practice, which we should regard as the focus of learning and research. Specifically, clinical learning can be carried out under the guidance of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners with a focus. Patients are examined and treated by traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine practitioners in cooperation (carefully making diagnoses, observations, and records). After recovery, the treatment experience is jointly summarized and explained theoretically, so as to gradually improve traditional Chinese medicine. The Chongqing Hemorrhoid and Fistula Treatment Group, the Tangshan Qigong Group, and the Shijiazhuang Encephalitis Treatment Group have set an example for us in this regard. We should learn from them and make traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine practitioners sincerely cooperate in politics and business, learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, and create new Chinese medicine that can reflect the labor of the Chinese people, reflect China's geography, climate, medicine, etc., so as to better serve the people's health.

    As for the research of traditional Chinese medicine, it has achieved certain results through the efforts of many scholars over the years. However, there are shortcomings in the research methods. Some people one-sidedly emphasize chemical analysis, believing that it is necessary to first extract the active ingredients from traditional Chinese medicine, then conduct animal pharmacological experiments, and then apply it to clinical practice. Facts have proved that it is too rash to judge the value of traditional Chinese medicine by simply using simple methods of analysis and testing. For example, in the past, some people used chemical analysis methods to study ginseng, and the results only found some glycosides, which could only play a role in strengthening the stomach or unimportant nutritional effects, and did not pay attention to it. However, according to recent research by scholars in the Soviet Union and China, the role of ginseng has been preliminarily confirmed: taking a small amount of ginseng can stimulate the cerebral cortex, and taking a large amount of ginseng can play an inhibitory role. This shows that ginseng has a good effect on neurological disorders. The components of traditional Chinese medicine are mostly plant organisms, and a single medicine is very complex. Many scientists believe that it is quite complicated and difficult to extract components from traditional Chinese medicine without reducing its efficacy (of course, its efficacy should be improved as much as possible). Because the extracted components often cannot represent the original plant medicine, and sometimes may have the opposite effect (the effective substances are destroyed in the extraction process, and what is often extracted are ineffective components). What's more, traditional Chinese medicine uses compound prescriptions. In this way, do we want to oppose chemical analysis? No, we do not oppose chemical analysis, animal experiments, etc.; but because there are still shortcomings in the scientific methods, and the dosage of traditional Chinese medicine has been verified by years of practice; therefore, we cannot only rely on these methods to judge the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine, but should combine the characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine use and clinical experience to research. We must invite traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and people with experience in preparing traditional Chinese medicine to participate in the research, and conduct a comparative analysis of clinical efficacy and testing to correctly measure the value of traditional Chinese medicine.

    In the process of learning traditional Chinese medicine policy, some people have asked: who should learn traditional Chinese medicine? Should it be used after learning? If Western medicine learns traditional Chinese medicine, is it considered traditional Chinese medicine or Western medicine? I believe that the responsibility of Western medicine is significant, and it must actively learn traditional Chinese medicine. A Western-trained doctor who understands traditional Chinese medicine has gained another tool to serve the people. There is no doubt that traditional Chinese medicine itself also needs to be constantly learning, because the level of traditional Chinese medicine is very inconsistent, and there are not many people who truly have Chinese medical literacy. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners with conditions should also learn modern medical knowledge in order to better help Western-trained doctors learn, or sort out traditional Chinese medicine. Health administrative leaders at all levels should also study traditional Chinese medicine in order to correctly grasp the traditional Chinese medicine policy.

    Learning is naturally for use. As for what to call it in name, there is no need to argue.

    Finally, it is also necessary to talk about the unity of studying and researching the medical heritage of the motherland and studying advanced Soviet medicine. Soviet medicine grew up on the basis of inheriting and carrying forward its own national cultural heritage, and it absorbed the medical essence of various ethnic groups in the Soviet Union. Pavlov's theory inherited the neurological theory and cerebral reflex theory of outstanding medical scientists such as Botkin and Sechenov, and became the guiding ideology of contemporary Soviet medical science workers. In recent years, new discoveries and diagnostic and treatment methods in medical science in the Soviet Union have been continuously introduced into our country, which has greatly benefited the people's health care in our country. Therefore, we should learn the advanced Soviet medical thought. For example, acupuncture therapy is a treatment method that has been practiced in China for a long time and is welcomed by the masses of the people, but in theory, it cannot be clearly explained. If we can learn Pavlov's theory of nervous system diseases and combine it with clinical research, we will certainly be able to enrich the content of acupuncture therapy in theory. Traditional Chinese medicine treats diseases, in many cases, pays attention to enhancing the body's resistance, improving the body's condition, and flexibly using various methods according to different objects and different manifestations of diseases, so as to achieve therapeutic effects. Some people say, since acupuncture has no anti-malarial agent, how can it treat malaria? Since traditional Chinese medicine does not understand bacteria, how can it treat infectious diseases? It is true that many diseases are caused by bacteria, protozoa, etc., which is a great discovery of modern medicine; but there is another side to the possibility of disease occurrence, that is, the body's resistance. Facts have proved that there are often many pathogens in the bodies of healthy people (such as pneumonia bacteria in the respiratory tract), but it does not often cause disease. Many drugs cannot directly act on bacteria and protozoa, such as quinine cannot directly kill malaria parasites, "914" cannot directly kill syphilis spirochetes, and sulfa drugs cannot directly kill bacteria. They must be effective through the biochemical action of the human body, especially the action of the nervous system. Therefore, when treating diseases, as long as certain therapies can affect the development process of the disease, disrupt its viciously rising link of cause and effect, it can help the diseased body gradually restore health. It is inappropriate to simply emphasize "specific drugs." Recently, some traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have used Pavlov's theory to explain the medicine of the motherland after learning it, which is a good phenomenon. But many people come out to oppose it, as if traditional Chinese medicine is not qualified to do so. This is wrong. If there are not enough good explanations, academic disputes can be launched.

    Studying and researching the medical heritage of the motherland is an arduous and glorious task. It must be carried out in a guided and organized manner. After criticizing Wang Bin's erroneous ideas, as long as the national health workers can sincerely cooperate, learn from each other, and persevere in their efforts, they will surely be able to complete this task.

    认真学习和研究祖国的医学
　　鲁之俊
    王斌一笔抹煞中医学术，说它是“封建医学”，是“主观观念论”，“只能在农民面前起到精神上有医生治疗的安慰作用”。这种说法既不符合历史，也不符合现状。
    在中国医学史上，有过许多卓越的医学家、如扁鹊、华陀、张仲景、王叔和、皇甫谧、葛洪、陶弘景、巢元方、孙思邈、王焘、孟诜、钱乙、陈自明、李时珍、吴又可、王清任等等，在这些医学家里面，包括了解剖、病理、诊断、药物、营养、内科、外科、妇科、小儿、针灸等科专家。他们的著作浩如烟海，只北京一地就已收集了一千八百多种，三万册以上。这都是我们祖先的劳动结晶，是非常珍贵的文化遗产。这些著作证明，许多医学上的发现以我国为最早，如种痘发源于我国，后来传播到欧洲，将人痘改为牛痘。糖尿、结核等病的记载我国则早于西欧千年以上。化学制药（即炼丹），也以我国最早。在这些著作中，李时珍的“本草纲目”已被译成多种外国文，流传到世界许多国家，至今还是科学家研究药物疗法的重要参考书。这许多宝贵遗产，并没有被我国广大的科学家尤其是具有近代科学知识的西医所重视。其原因虽然很多，但下面这个因素不能不是重要的：我们西医，一部分知识是从学校学得的，一部分知识是在实际工作中积累起来的。而在旧社会，无论在学校和医疗单位中，由于资产阶级奴化思想和宗派主义的影响，祖国的医学历史不被重视，甚至往往被歪曲（医学校里面大多讲授西欧医学史）。因此，人们只知盲目地否定中医，说它“不科学”“落后”等等；而不了解几千年来中国人民是依靠中医来保健的，现在半数以上的城市居民和几乎全部乡村居民靠中医中药治病。中医的疗效是显著的，甚至一些现代医学方法尚难以治疗的疾病，也往往给有经验的中医治好了。所以这份可贵的文化遗产，有很大的实用和研究价值。我们应该整理和发扬其中合理的部分，为人民的保健事业服务。至于以自然科学为基础的现代医学的输入中国，只是近百年来的事。它对人民保健事业确实起了相当重要的作用，如果能够和中国医学结合起来，各取所长，当能为人民作出更大的贡献。
    近几十年来，我国一些科学家研究了“本草纲目”中所载的少数药品，证实了它的疗效的巨大。如不少人所知道的，常山可以治疟疾，白头翁、鸦胆子治痢疾，当归可以调经，益母草治子宫出血，槟榔、雷丸、使君子、苦楝皮等可驱除肠寄生虫，贝母止咳，柴胡遏热，延胡索止痛，杜仲降血压，而人参则是极有效的强壮剂。针灸是中国所特有的疗法，它不仅对许多疾病有显著的疗效，而且简便、经济，在人民中有极大的信誉。近年来的经验证明，针灸可以解决现代医学感到棘手的许多疾病问题。据最近北京儿童医院报告，针灸疗法对小儿麻痹、腹泻等症有很好的疗效，对扁桃腺等喉症也有极高的治疗效果；把它应用到妇产科，可以调治月经。内蒙古自治区的报告证明，针灸疗法对风湿症、消化系疾病，效果也极良好。如果能对它作进一步的研究，我们一定还可以发现许多新的东西。在北京工作的重庆痔瘘小组，一年多以来治疗了数百名痔疮和肛瘘患者。他们应用改进了的中医治疗方法，患者在肉体上很少感到痛苦，也不致引起失血的现象。就是在炎症期间也可以进行治疗；贫血或年老或有肺结核的痔瘘患者，也可以用此法治疗，不会引起肛门狭窄或失禁等后遗症。因此，这个方法在某些方面优于其他痔瘘疗法。唐山疗养所对气功疗法（近似睡眠疗法，但不用药。病人在医生指导下安静坐卧，经过一定时间以后，脑皮质因得到休息而逐渐恢复神经功能。这种医病健身的方法，以往被道家利用，故为人民误认为是迷信）进行了实验，初步证明效果很好。参加实验的有七十多名难治的病人，他们都患有常见的慢性疾患，如胃下垂，胃或十二指肠溃疡，以及长期失眠、头痛、遗精等症。治疗前经西医检查，确定诊断，愈后并作了复查。石家庄去年乙型脑炎流行（经科学诊断无疑），请中医参加治疗，使病死率降低（特别是脑炎的后遗症，中医的疗效更是显著）。上面的这些事实虽然只是中医学术的一部分，但已充分证明中医有着极有价值的内容，这是无论如何也不能被抹煞的事实。因此王斌否定中医的价值是毫无根据的，在这些事实面前只有更暴露他的卑鄙的资产阶级思想的本质。自然，祖国医学不是没有缺点的，例如，它偏重于经验，有的论述得不够完善，也解释得不透彻，这要求我们来加以整理，用现代科学方法加以说明，并发展和提高它。这是一项光荣而艰巨的历史任务。
    我们既然知道了祖国医学的成就是那样光辉，疗效又是那样显著，就应该努力学习和研究它。为了有成效地学习和研究祖国医学遗产，首先须要把学习的目的明确起来。我们学习中医的目的，是为了发扬祖国文化遗产，丰富现代医学科学，提高医疗技术水平，更好地为人民保健事业服务。要继承和发扬这份宝贵遗产，关键在于西医学习中医。这是中央早就指示过的。掌握了一定的现代医学理论、有临床经验的西医，只要对中医学术有了认识，能够虚心诚恳地向中医学习，经过长期的中西医合作，就一定能够作出成绩。以前有些西医在学习中医并在整理中医学术方面曾经做了一些工作；中医也曾用新方法研究了中医学术，取得了一定成绩。但是在西医学习中医的过程里，往往发生这种现象：有的把中医学术看作“古董”，认为中医学术只是历史陈迹了，没有什么现实意义；有的从兴趣出发，希望从里边发现奇迹，以便名利双收；甚至有些人如余云岫，则是为了攻击中医而研究中医的。虽然他对中医学术进行了几十年的所谓研究，并写过“医学革命论”等书，但是内容都是片面地强调中医的缺点，宣传中医落后、不科学等否定中医的思想，对于发扬医学遗产不但毫无贡献，反而起了阻碍的作用。这些人学习和研究中医学术的目的，都是不正确的。而这些人的影响直到现在还没有完全清除。从最近中医进医院工作的情况来看，有些西医表面上表示愿意向中医学习，实际上是各搞各的一套；有的为了应付病人，把某些复杂的甚至无望的病症推给中医来治（自然对有些疑难病症实行会诊是应该的）；有的故意刁难中医；有些单位请了中医，并设了中医诊疗科室，行政领导人员以为“任务完了”，没有指定专人去领导。这些都是形式主义的学习方法，必须及早纠正。
    如何学习和研究中医，这是一个新问题。我以为大致可以从两个方面入手。一方面是学中医书籍。但书太多，有不少是重复或相近的。最好首先选择几种基本的著作进行钻研，如“内经”“伤寒论”“金匮要略”“本草纲目”等。不过这些书的文字不易读懂，可以请中医来讲解。但有时讲的人也很难把它通俗化，我们必须耐心地听下去，联系临床实际加以思索。也可以参阅某些有注释的作品，特别是近几十年来有些中医整理过的作品。为了便于西医学习中医，有人要求把病名统一起来。这固然是好事，但一时是办不到的。因为某些病名中西医虽相同，但含意往往各异，如中医“伤寒论”包括了多种的热性病，如果我们把它解释成西医的“肠伤寒”（或是肠热症），那便风马牛不相及了。因此我们千万不能用西医的诊断病名来硬套。中西医之间的共同语言（术语），必须经过长期的实践才能获得。近来各地中医杂志在这方面曾作了某些研究，可以供大家参考。如果想学习中医的某一专科，那除了学习一般的中医书籍以外，还可以在中医专科书籍上去用功夫。但是更重要的是临床实践，我们应该把它作为学习研究的重点。具体做法，可以在中医指导下有重点地进行临床学习。由中西医合作给病人进行检查治疗（认真作诊断、观察和记录），待治愈后，共同总结治疗的经验，并从理论上加以说明，这样才能逐步提高中医。重庆痔瘘小组、唐山气功小组，石家庄脑炎治疗组等，已在这方面给我们树立了榜样。我们应该向他们学习，使中西医在政治上和业务上都能做到真诚合作，取长补短，创造能反映我国人民劳动，反映我国地理、气候、医药等等特点的新的中国医学，以更好地为人民健康事业服务。
    至于中药的研究，多年来经过不少学者的努力，已得到了一定的收获。可是在研究方法上是有缺点的。有些人片面地强调化学分析，认为必须先从中药里边提取有效成分，再经过动物药理试验，然后才能把它应用到临床上去。事实证明，单纯用分析化验的简单方法来判断中药的有无价值，是过于轻率的。例如，以前有人用化验分析方法研究人参，结果只发现有些配糖体，仅能起到健胃或不重要的营养作用，不予重视。但据近年苏联和我国学者的研究，初步肯定了人参的作用：服用少量的人参能兴奋大脑皮质，服用大量的人参可起抑制作用。这说明人参对于神经功能症是有良好疗效的。中药的成分是植物有机体居多，一味药就非常复杂。许多科学家都认为，要很好地从中药中提炼出成分，而不降低其疗效（当然应尽可能地提高其疗效）是相当复杂而困难的。因为，提取出来的成分往往不能代表原植物药，有时可能具有相反的作用（有效物质在提炼过程中被破坏了，而提取到的往往是无效成分）。何况中医用药又是复方使用法。这样说来，是不是要反对化验分析呢？不，我们不反对作化学分析、动物实验等；但是由于在科学方法上还有缺点，而中药的剂量又是经多年实践检证了的；因此目前尚不能只靠这些方法来判断中药的疗效，而应当结合中医用药的特点和临床经验来研究。我们必须请中医和对泡制中药有经验的人参加研究，用临床疗效同化验进行对照分析，以正确地衡量中药的价值。
    在学习中医政策过程中，有些人提出：到底哪些人学中医？学了以后是否要运用？西医学了中医，究竟算中医还是算西医？我认为西医的责任是重大的，必须积极地学习中医。一个西医如果懂得了中医，他便多得了一种为人民服务的工具。没有疑问，中医本身也是需要不断学习的，因为中医的水平很不一致，真正具有中国医学素养的人还不是很多的。有条件的中医，还应当学习现代医学知识，以便能更好地帮助西医进行学习，或整理中医学术。各级卫生行政领导人员，也应该学习中医学术，以便正确地掌握中医政策。
    学习自然是为了使用。至于在名义上称什么，没有什么争论的必要。
    最后，还需要谈一下学习、研究祖国医学同学习苏联先进医学的统一性问题。苏联医学是在继承和发扬自己祖国文化遗产的基础上成长起来的，它吸收了苏联各民族的医学精华。巴甫洛夫学说继承了卓越的医学科学家包特金、谢巧诺夫等人的神经论和大脑反射理论学说，成为现时苏联医学科学工作者的指导思想。近年来苏联在医学科学方面的新发现和诊疗方法，不断传入我国，使我国人民保健事业得益极多。因此，我们应该学习苏联先进医学思想。例如，针灸疗法是中国行之已久并得到人民群众欢迎的治疗方法，但是在理论上还不能给予清楚的解说，如果我们能学习巴甫洛夫学说的神经病理论，结合临床进行研究，一定能从理论上充实针灸疗法的内容。中医治病，在许多情况下都注意增强人体的抗力，改善机体的条件，并按不同对象、疾病的不同表现，灵活运用各种方法，收到治疗效果。有人说，针灸既无杀疟剂，那能治疟？中医既不了解细菌，怎能治传染病？不错，有不少疾病是由细菌原虫等引起的，这是近代医学的伟大发现；但是疾病的发生可能性还有另一面，即身体抵抗的一面。事实证明，在健康者的身上常有不少的致病菌
  （如呼吸道中的肺炎菌等），但它并没有经常引起疾病。许多药物不能直接作用于细菌原虫，如奎宁不能直接杀死疟原虫，“九一四”不能直接杀死梅毒螺旋体，磺氨剂不能直接杀菌，必须经人体的生物化学作用，特别是神经系统的作用，才能有效。因此治疗疾病时，只要某些疗法能影响疾病的发展过程，打扰其因果交替的恶性上升环节，就能帮助病体逐渐恢复健康。单纯地强调“特效药”是不妥当的。近来有些中医在学习巴甫洛夫学说之后用它来解释祖国医学，这是一种好现象。但有不少人出来反对，似乎中医是没有资格这样作的。这是不对的。如果有解释得不够妥善的地方，可展开学术争论。
    学习和研究祖国医学遗产是一项艰巨而又光荣的任务。必须有领导有组织地进行。全国卫生工作者，在批判王斌的错误思想以后，只要能真诚合作，相互学习，坚持不懈地努力，一定能够完成这个任务。
