    Taiyuan Heating and Power Plant Saves Construction Funds
    In the past year, the Taiyuan Heating and Power Plant has taken a series of measures to eliminate waste and increase the accumulation of national funds by strengthening design management, strictly reviewing budget estimates and final accounts, handling backlogs, utilizing waste materials, improving labor organization, and increasing labor productivity, saving funds for the country.
    The Taiyuan Heating and Power Plant reduced projects that were postponed, such as the eighth branch line of the railway, the fire and security guard building, and the administrative office building, saving 418,000 yuan. All of this fund was invested in the installation project which was overfulfilled by 16 percent in 1954, saving the country's investment. Furthermore, by strengthening design management, strictly reviewing budget estimates and final accounts, changing high-grade asphalt pavement to low-grade asphalt pavement, and partially changing it to gravel roads, and reducing the purchase of production tools and daily necessities, the plant also saved the country 1.16 million yuan from October last year to the end of June this year.
    The 360 Engineering Company, which is responsible for the construction of the Taiyuan Heating and Power Plant, disposed of over 1.73 million yuan worth of backlogged materials and waste materials. From January to June this year, a total of 132 tons of waste materials were utilized. In addition to the amount that should be recovered according to the state's residual material discount price, the company also saved the country over 56,000 yuan. The Engineering Company also reduced the material consumption rate. In the cable item alone, the reduction in the material consumption rate saved the country 70,000 yuan. According to the needs of the project, the Engineering Company combined the original eight construction sites into three construction sites, reorganizing the surplus employees.
    In order to implement the policy of opposing waste and practicing strict economy, the Taiyuan Heating and Power Plant also organized a savings inspection team and mobilized the masses to put forward rationalization proposals.

    太原电热厂节约建设资金
    太原电热厂，近一年来在加强设计管理，严格审核预决算，处理积压，利用废料，改善劳动组织，提高劳动生产率等方面，采取了一系列的消灭浪费、增加国家资金积累的措施，为国家节约了资金。
    太原电热厂削减了缓办工程铁路第八支线、消防警卫楼、行政办公室等工程，就节约了四十一万八千元。这笔资金全部被投在一九五四年超额完成的百分之十六的安装工程上，节省了国家的投资。又由于加强了设计管理，严格审核预算决算，把高级沥青路面改为低级沥青路面，部分并改为石子路，缩减生产工具和生活用品购置等，从去年十月到今年六月底，也给国家节约了一百一十六万元。
    为太原电热厂施工的三六○工程公司，处理了价值一百七十三万多元的积压和废料，今年一至六月共利用废料一百三十二吨，除按国家残料折价应收回的金额外，还给国家节约了五万六千多元。工程公司还降低了材料消耗率。仅电缆一项，降低材料消耗率，就给国家节约了七万元。根据工程需要，工程公司把原来的八个工地，并为三个工地，整编了多余职工。
    为贯彻反对浪费、厉行节约的方针，太原电热厂并组织了节约检查组，发动群众提合理化建议。
