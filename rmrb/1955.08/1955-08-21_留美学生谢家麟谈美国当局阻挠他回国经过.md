Xinhua News Agency, August 20th: This reporter reports: Xie Jialin, a Chinese student who recently returned to the motherland from the United States, recounted to this reporter the facts of how he was obstructed for a long time and unable to return to his motherland.

Xie Jialin went to the United States in 1947 to study physics. In 1951, he received a doctorate in physics from Stanford University. In August of that year, he formally submitted an application to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service to return to China, but the Immigration Service at the time threatened Xie Jialin, saying that returning to China was like "falling into a trap." Personnel from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation also took Xie Jialin to a car to interrogate and threaten him. After these methods failed to achieve their purpose, the Immigration Service superficially approved Xie Jialin's application to return to China. However, when Xie Jialin was on a ship in September en route from the U.S. to China and arrived in Honolulu, he and eight other Chinese students in the United States were suddenly summoned on the ship by personnel from the Immigration Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation and were detained in the Honolulu Detention Center. The U.S. authorities, without any reason, announced that they would not be allowed to return to China.

Thus, Xie Jialin returned to the United States from Honolulu. From September 1951 to July 1955, for nearly four years, Xie Jialin was forced to stay in the United States against his own will. During this period, he worked successively at the University of Oregon, the Stanford University Microwave Laboratory, and the Michael Reese Hospital. Because he did not give up his application to return to China, he was still "visited" by personnel from the Federal Bureau of Investigation during this period, and the Immigration Service required him to report to the bureau every three months.

It was not until the beginning of July 1955 that Xie Jialin had the opportunity to set off to return to China. However, he was still obstructed on his way back to China. While traveling from San Francisco on the American ship "President Wilson" via Hong Kong to return to China, Xie Jialin received a telegram saying that a younger sister of his in Seattle had suddenly fallen ill. Because of this matter, Xie Jialin made a long-distance call to his sister in Los Angeles. His sister told Xie Jialin in person on the phone that her condition was not serious and that Xie Jialin did not need to worry about her. However, when the ship arrived in Yokohama, Japan, an agent from the American President Lines came to Xie Jialin as a representative of the American Consulate in Yokohama, telling him that "all the procedures" for returning to the United States had been completed. After Xie Jialin expressed that he did not want to return to the United States at all, American journalists immediately issued a large number of reports saying that Xie Jialin was "forced to return to the United States" because he was "threatened," completely disregarding the fact that he had repeatedly stated that returning to China had been his long-standing wish. Subsequently, when the ship arrived in Manila, an official from the American Embassy in the Philippines and the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "ambassador" to the Philippines boarded the ship to "visit," spreading rumors and intimidating Xie Jialin, saying that his family in China had already "been liquidated" and were now missing, and that he had better go to the United States or Taiwan. When Xie Jialin arrived in Hong Kong, the American Vice Consul in Hong Kong, Morsel, went to the ship and the Kowloon Railway Station to pester Xie Jialin, still wanting him to return to the United States. Morsel said that he was doing this under the instructions of the American government.

However, Xie Jialin broke through all these rumors, deceptions, and threats, and finally realized his long-cherished desire to return to the embrace of the motherland on August 2, arriving in Guangzhou, and then arriving in the capital, Beijing, on August 7.

Xie Jialin received the reporter at his home in Beijing. He told the reporter that his family had not been "liquidated" as American officials had said. His parents are both healthy, his wife teaches in the Physics Department of Beijing Normal University, and his son, who was only four months old when he left the motherland, is now an eight-year-old primary school student. Xie Jialin said that it is a joy to be able to see his relatives and motherland again after eight years of separation.

　　留美学生谢家麟谈美国当局阻挠他回国经过
    新华社二十日讯　本社记者报道：最近从美国返回祖国的中国留美学生谢家麟在同本社记者谈话时，叙述他长期受到种种阻挠而不得返回祖国的事实。
    谢家麟是在一九四七年到美国去学物理的。一九五一年，他在史坦福大学获得了物理学博士学位。这年八月，他就正式向美国移民和归化局提出了回国的申请，但是移民局当时却恫吓谢家麟说，返回中国等于“落入陷阱”。美国联邦调查局的人员还把谢家麟带到一辆汽车上，对他进行盘问和威胁。在这些做法未达到目的以后，移民局在表面上批准了谢家麟的回国申请。但是，当谢家麟在九月间乘船启程离美回国途中到达檀香山时，他和其他八个中国留美学生一道，又突然在船上遭到移民局和联邦调查局人员的传讯，并且被关押进了檀香山的拘留所。美国当局毫无理由，宣布不准他们回国。
    这样，谢家麟又从檀香山回到美国。从一九五一年九月到一九五五年七月近四年中，谢家麟一直违反着他自己的意愿被迫留在美国。在这一段期间，他先后在俄勒冈大学、史坦福大学微波研究所、迈克尔—李斯医院任职。由于他没有放弃回国的申请，他在这个时期仍然遭到联邦调查局人员的“访问”，移民局并且要他每三个月向该局报到一次。
    直到一九五五年七月初，谢家麟才获得机会启程回国。但是，他在回国途中仍然受到阻挠。在从旧金山乘美国轮船“威尔逊总统号”取道香港返国途中将要抵达洛杉矶时，谢家麟接到了一封电报，说他在西雅图的一个妹妹患了急病。为了这件事情，谢家麟在洛杉矶打了一个长途电话给他的妹妹。他的妹妹在电话中亲口告诉谢家麟说，她的病情并不严重，要谢家麟不必为她担心。然而，在轮船到了日本横滨时，就有一个美国总统轮船公司的代理人以美国驻横滨领事馆的代表的身份来找谢家麟，告诉他回美国去的“一切手续已经办妥”。在谢家麟表示根本不想回美国以后，美国记者们就立即发出了大量所谓谢家麟是因为“受到威胁”而“被迫回国”的消息，完全不顾他曾经多次表示的回国本来是他长期来的愿望的这一事实。随后，当轮船到马尼拉时，美国驻菲律宾大使馆的一个官员和蒋介石集团驻菲律宾的“大使”又登轮“访问”，造谣恫吓谢家麟说，他在国内的家人已经“被清算了”，现在已经下落不明，他最好还是到美国或者台湾去。当谢家麟到香港后，美国驻香港副领事莫塞尔又到船上和九龙火车站同谢家麟纠缠，还是要他回到美国去。莫塞尔表示他这样做是得到美国政府指示的。
    但是，谢家麟冲破了所有这一切造谣、欺骗和威胁，终于实现了他多年来的渴望，在八月二日回到祖国的怀抱，到达了广州，接着在八月七日到达了首都北京。
    谢家麟在他北京的家里接见了记者。他对记者说，他的家庭没有如美国官员所说的那样遭到“清算”。他的父母都很健康，妻子在北京师范学院物理系任教，他离开祖国时才四个月的儿子已经是一个八岁的小学生了。谢家麟说，能够再见到离别八年的亲人和祖国，是幸福的。
