    Charles Darwin's immortal work, "On the Origin of Species," published on November 24, 1859, with the full title "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life," is a landmark event in the history of biological science. It established the victory of the materialistic theory of evolution and laid a truly scientific foundation for biology.
    "On the Origin of Species" sold out on the day of its publication. From 1859 to 1872, a total of six editions were issued. Revisions were made from the third edition onwards.
    The earliest Chinese translation was by Ma Junwu. He initially translated the "Historical Sketch" chapter in classical Chinese, which was published in the "Xinmin Congbao" in Yokohama, Japan, in 1902. In 1903, he translated Chapter 3 ("Struggle for Existence") and Chapter 4 ("Natural Selection; or the Survival of the Fittest"), which were published as a separate book. In 1904, "The Origin of Species" Volume 1 was published, including the "Historical Sketch" and the first five chapters. In 1918, he continued to translate the following ten chapters and revised Volume 1, which was published by Zhonghua Book Company in 1920 under the title "The Origin of Things." Mr. Zhou Jianren's translation was published by Shenghuo Bookstore in 1947, with only "Volume 1" published, comprising eight chapters (the "Historical Sketch" was not translated); the remaining seven chapters were translated but not published. The current translation published by Sanlian Bookstore is a re-organization of the published and unpublished translated texts under the direction of the original translator, Mr. Zhou Jianren, and is published in three volumes (two volumes have already been published). It is planned to revise it further in the next edition, taking into account the opinions of various parties, and compile it into one volume.
    The mid-19th century was a period of vigorous development of capitalism in Britain, and Darwin's theory was a product of this rising capitalism. With the development of capitalism, large farms appeared. In terms of animals and plants, selective methods were used to improve old varieties and cultivate new varieties to meet the needs of the market at that time. Darwin paid close attention to the achievements of selection practices at the time and applied them to his own theory. However, the idea of evolution did not begin with Darwin; it had a long history before him. Darwin clearly recognized the issue of scientific inheritance. Therefore, at the beginning of "On the Origin of Species," he used a chapter to narrate "An Historical Sketch of the Progress of Opinion on the Origin of Species, Previous to the Publication of the First Edition of this Work." Here, he briefly explained the development of the concept of evolution from the French naturalist Buffon (1707-1788), and particularly gave high praise to the achievements of Lamarck (1744-1829). From this, it can be seen that the previous scientific development, the accumulation of facts and knowledge about the natural world, created the necessary conditions for Darwin's theory. Another extremely important condition for the formation of Darwin's theory was his actual observations. From 1831 to 1836, he served as a naturalist on the HMS Beagle, departing from England and traveling extensively in South America, Africa, Australia, and their coastal islands, widely and carefully observing the various conditions of paleontology and extant organisms. He once said that this was the most important event in his life.
    However, the prevailing idea at the time was that the variety of nature and the adaptability of organisms to living conditions were all created by God or the "Cosmic God." Everything was pre-arranged, everything was perfect, and everything was immutable; cats were created by God to eat mice, and mice were born to be eaten by cats. However, the many natural phenomena that the young Darwin saw during his travels were completely incompatible with these ideas of "creationism" and "teleology."
    During his five-year voyage, Darwin observed a large number of facts. After returning to England, he worked hard for more than twenty years to complete this great work. In this work, Darwin shattered the fallacy of the immutability of species with abundant examples and revealed the laws of species formation.
    When Darwin began to study the enormous problem of the origin of species, he chose the correct path from the beginning, namely, facing human practice—the way humans cultivate new varieties of animals and plants. From this, he came to the conclusion that domesticated animals and cultivated plants have undergone drastic variations under the influence of the conditions created by humans since ancient times. He believed that this variability is a common law of nature. Domesticated animals and cultivated plants have variability, and wild animals and plants in natural conditions also have variability. He analyzed that the main reason for variability is the impact of changed living conditions on organisms. He said: "Conditions of life evidently act in two ways,—directly on the whole organisation or on certain parts alone, and indirectly by affecting the reproductive system." ("On the Origin of Species"). At the same time, he also believed that the use and disuse of organs is also a cause of variation. As for the reasons for heredity, Darwin failed to explain them, believing that "the laws governing inheritance are for the most part unknown." ("On the Origin of Species"). However, Darwin did discover several laws of heredity, which still have great scientific and practical significance today.
    From domesticated animals, Darwin studied in detail the origins of varieties of pigeons, chickens, horses, dogs, and rabbits. He believed that although there are many varieties of pigeons, they all originated from one ancestor, namely, the wild rock pigeon. The same is true for cultivated plants, which all originated from one or several wild species. But how did humans obtain so many changed domestic types from wild animals and plants? Darwin believed that humans used the variability and heredity of organisms and selected the variations that best suited human needs. These selected variations accumulated generation after generation, forming the various types of domesticated animals and cultivated plants. Darwin called this selection "artificial selection." Darwin spent a great deal of effort on this issue, personally observing and collecting a large number of facts, consulting a large amount of literature, and even ancient Chinese literature.
    As a result of studying artificial selection, Darwin believed that there is a similar selection process in natural conditions, which is called "natural selection" or "the preservation of the fittest." In nature, individuals with favorable variations will be selected or preserved, while those individuals that cannot adapt to the changed environmental conditions will be eliminated; this process of preserving and accumulating favorable variations and eliminating unfavorable variations is the process of natural selection. At the same time, he believed that in natural selection, the relationship between organisms and between organisms and the environment is the factor that eliminates those less perfect types. He called this interrelationship "the struggle for existence."
    Darwin established the science of the historical development of organisms. He proved that every species is formed from another species, and gave a materialistic explanation of the diversity of organisms and their adaptation to living conditions. Darwin's theory fundamentally destroyed the religious idea that everything in existence is fixed and unchanging, and laid the foundation for scientific biology.
    Therefore, Darwinism initially aroused various different reactions. Advanced scholars and social activists warmly welcomed and rose up to defend Darwinism, while church figures, reactionary scholars, and social activists fiercely attacked Darwinism. The classic writers of Marxism-Leninism highly valued Darwin's works. After reading "On the Origin of Species," Marx wrote to Engels, saying: "This book provides our views with a natural scientific basis." Engels believed that Darwin's theory was one of the three great discoveries that promoted the development of natural science in the nineteenth century. Furthermore, Engels wrote that Darwin "dealt the metaphysical view of nature the most powerful blow and proved that the entire modern organic world, plants, animals, and humans, is the result of a developmental process lasting millions of years." ("Socialism: Utopian and Scientific").
    Regarding Darwin's works, Lenin also pointed out: "Darwin overthrew the view that the species of animals and plants are accidental, 'God-created,' immutable things that have no connection with each other, and for the first time placed biology on a completely scientific basis, determining the variability of each species and its inheritance" ("What is 'The Friends of the People'"). Stalin believed that Darwin belonged to those who "regardless of any obstacles, can break old sayings and create new ones." ("Speech at the Reception of Senior School Staff in the Kremlin").
    Darwin's work still retains its value as a classic. It is not only a must-read for biological science workers, but also a good read for workers in other departments. Especially in the current struggle to promote dialectical materialism and criticize bourgeois idealism, this work has its practical significance. Because from here, we can see that everything in nature has evolved and developed over millions of years according to its own natural laws; we can also see that the development process of biological science and Darwinism is the history of the struggle between materialism and idealism, dialectics and metaphysics, and the progressive revolutionary side and the backward reactionary side in science. Furthermore, the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts, being humble and sincere, and daring to struggle against outdated traditions and stubborn ideas, as demonstrated by Darwin in this great work, is also worthy of our serious study.
    However, it must be pointed out that Darwin's theory is not complete and flawless. While pointing out the great significance of Darwin's theory, the classic writers of Marxism-Leninism also pointed out the contradictions and errors contained in Darwin's theory. Because Darwin was limited by methodological narrowness, he could not get rid of the shackles of vulgar evolutionism. He argued that there are no relatively fixed boundaries between species, thus denying the reality of species. In order to explain the intermittent phenomena that actually exist between species in nature, Darwin applied Malthus's erroneous views on population. He believed that as a result of the fierce struggle within species, all intermediate types were extinct because of their poor adaptability. In his view, the struggle within species was caused by the fact that the number of individuals of a certain species in nature often exceeded the limits allowed by their existing living conditions. Thus, Darwin regarded the struggle within species as the main driving force of biological evolution. This erroneous statement not only promoted Malthus's reactionary theory of overpopulation, but also contradicted his own theory of natural selection.
    However, in capitalist countries, Darwin's theory was met with a very hostile attitude. Darwin's theory courses were driven out of schools, and people who taught Darwin's theory were tried as criminals. Some reactionary elements in science, under the guise of Darwinism, slandered and distorted Darwin. They tried everything possible to castrate the materialistic elements in Darwin's theory and promote the idealistic elements in Darwin's theory. The United States is a typical anti-Darwinist country. To this day, Darwin's theory is still forbidden to be taught in many states in the United States. In pre-liberation China, Darwin's theory was also treated with cold eyes. At that time, in the field of biology in our country, the reactionary Mendel-Morgan theory occupied a dominant position. Not only was there no course on Darwin's theory in schools, but it was even difficult to find all of Darwin's works in large libraries.
    Only in socialist and people's democratic countries has Darwinism gained attention and development. In the Soviet Union, Michurin biological workers base their research work on Darwin's theory of development. Soviet Darwinism is creative Darwinism. Michurin's theory advanced biological science to a higher stage. Facts have proved that only on the basis of dialectical materialism can the limitations and shortcomings in Darwin's theory be corrected. Currently in the Soviet Union, in-depth research and extensive debates are underway on the issue of species formation.
    The founding of New China has ushered in a new era for biological science in our country. In the past five years, thanks to the care and leadership of the Party and the government, the biological community in our country has gained great achievements in studying Darwinism. However, Xie Tao, one of the key members of the Hu Feng clique, ignored the achievements of our country's biological science in this area and shamelessly slandered that Darwin's "On the Origin of Species" was only half translated during the Kuomintang era, while New China has not translated any of it. The Hu Feng elements attempted to use this to show that our New China is even more backward than the old China under the reactionary Kuomintang rule. But the facts have given a resounding slap in his ugly face. Not only have we translated and published Darwin's "On the Origin of Species," but several other major works of Darwin are also being translated. In the future, under the guidance of creative Darwinism, biological science in our country will surely achieve more rapid development.

　　介绍“物种起源”
　　达尔文著　周建人等译　三联书店出版
　　叶笃庄
    查理斯·达尔文的不朽著作“物种起源”出版于一八五九年十一月二十四日，全名为“依据自然选择，即在生存斗争中适者的保存的物种起源”，这是生物科学历史的划时代的标志。它确定了唯物主义的进化论的胜利，给生物学奠定了真正科学的基础。
    “物种起源”一书在出版的当日便销售一空。从一八五九年到一八七二年，共发行了六版。第三版以次都有修正。
    中文的最早译本是由马君武翻译的。他最初用文言译出“史略”一章，载于一九○二年日本横滨“新民丛报”。一九○三年译出第三章（“生存斗争”）和第四章（“自然选择；即最适者生存”），作为单行本出版。一九○四年出版“物种由来”第一卷，包括“史略”和前五章。一九一八年续译以下十章，并修订第一卷，于一九二○年以“物种原始”为名由中华书局出版。周建人先生的译本是一九四七年由生活书店刊行的，只出版了“上卷”，共八章（“史略”未译）；下余七章虽经译出，但未得出版。目前三联书店出版的这个译本，就是在原译者周建人先生的主持下，对于已出版的和未出版而已译出的译文，重新加以整理，分作三个分册出版（现已出版了两个分册）。并拟再版时参照各方面的意见，再加修订，汇成一册。
    十九世纪中叶正是资本主义在英国蓬勃发展的时期，达尔文学说就是这个上升着的资本主义的产物。随着资本主义的发展，大型农场出现了。在动植物方面，便采用了选择的方法来改良旧品种和育成新品种，以适应当时市场的需要。达尔文非常注意当时选种实践的成就，并把它运用在自己的学说中。然而，进化的思想并不是从达尔文起才开始有的，在他以前已经有过漫长的历史了。达尔文非常清楚地认识到科学的继承性这一问题，所以在“物种起源”的开始，他用了一章的篇幅来叙述“本书第一版刊行前，有关‘物种起源’的意见的发展史略”。在这里他扼要地说明了从法国博物学者布丰
  （一七○七——一七八八）开始的进化观念的发展情形，特别是给予了拉马克（一七四四——一八二九）的功绩以很高的评价。由此可以知道，以往的科学发展，有关自然界的事实和知识的积累，为达尔文的学说创造了必不可少的条件。对于达尔文学说的形成，还有一个极其重要的条件，那就是他的实际观察。一八三一——一八三六年，他曾充当比格尔号探险军舰的博物学者，由英国出发，遍游南美洲、非洲、澳洲及其沿岸的岛屿，广泛而仔细地观察了古生物和现存生物的种种情况。他曾说过，这是他生平中最重要的事件。
    然而当时所流行的是这样一种观念，认为自然界的形形色色和有机体对生活条件的适应性，都是上帝或者“宇宙之神”所创造的。一切都是预先安排好的，一切都是最完善的，一切都是不变的；猫是被上帝创造出来吃老鼠的，而老鼠生下来就是为了给猫吃的。但是，年青的达尔文在旅行中所看到的许许多多的自然界现象，同这些“神造论”和“目的论”的观念都是完全不相容的。
    在五年的航海旅行中，达尔文观察了大量的事实。回到英国之后，他又经过二十多年的辛勤劳动，才完成了这一伟大的著作。在这部著作中，达尔文以丰富的实例粉碎了物种不变的谬说，并揭示了物种形成的规律。
    达尔文从事物种起源这一巨大问题的研究时，一开始便选择了正确的途径，即面向人类实践——人类培育动植物新品种的途径。由此，他得出了一个结论：家养动物和栽培植物自古以来在人类所创造的条件的影响下，发生了剧烈的变异。他认为这种变异性乃是自然界的共同规律，家养动物和栽培植物有变异性，在自然状况下的野生动物和植物也有变异性。他分析了变异性的主要原因是改变了的生活条件对于有机体的影响。他说：“生活条件显然以两种方式发生作用——即直接作用于整个体制或只作用于某些部分，以及间接作用于生殖系统。”（“物种起源”）同时，他还认为器官的使用和不使用，也是变异的原因。至于遗传性的原因，达尔文并未能给予解释，他认为“支配遗传的诸法则，大部分是未知的”（“物种起源”）。不过达尔文却发现了若干遗传的规律，这些规律，直到今天还具有很大的科学的和实际的意义。
    从家养动物中，达尔文详细地研究了鸽、鸡、马、狗和兔等的品种的起源。他认为，他所知道的鸽子虽然品种极多，但这些鸽子都起源于一个祖先，即野生岩鸽。栽培植物亦复如此，它们都是起源于一个或几个野生种的。然而人类用什么方法从野生动物和植物中获得了如此众多的、改变了的家养类型呢？达尔文认为人类利用了生物的变异性和遗传性，而对那些最符合于人类需要的变异进行了选择，被选择的这些变异一代一代地积累下来，便形成了形形色色的家养动物和栽培植物。达尔文把这种选择叫作“人工选择”。在这个问题上，达尔文费了很大的功夫，亲自观察和搜集了大量的事实，参考了大量的文献，甚至中国古代的文献。
    研究人工选择的结果，达尔文认为在自然状况下也有类似的选择过程，这就叫作“自然选择”或
  “适者的被保存”。在自然界中具有有利的变异的个体会被选择或保存下来，而那些对改变了的环境条件不能适应的个体会被淘汰掉；这种有利变异的被保存和累积，以及不利变异的被淘汰的过程，就是自然选择的过程。同时，他认为在自然选择中，生物彼此之间的以及生物同环境之间的关系，就是消灭那些较不完善的类型的因素，他把这种相互关系叫作“生存斗争”。
    达尔文建立了关于有机体历史发展的科学。他证明了每一物种都是从另一物种形成的，并且对于生物的多样性及其对生活条件的适应性给予了唯物主义的阐明。达尔文的理论根本地摧毁了关于一切存在都是固定不变的宗教思想，奠定了科学生物学的基础。
    因此，达尔文主义一开始就引起了各种不同的反响。先进的学者和社会活动家都热烈欢迎并奋起保卫达尔文主义，而教会人士、反动的学者和社会活动家则对达尔文主义进行猛烈的攻击。马克思列宁主义的经典作家对达尔文著作的评价是很高的。马克思在读了“物种起源”一书后，曾写信给恩格斯说：“这本书给我们的观点予以自然科学上的基础。”恩格斯认为达尔文学说乃是十九世纪推动自然科学发展的三大发现之一。并且，恩格斯写道：达尔文“给了形而上学的自然观以最有力的打击，证明了整个近代的有机界，植物动物以及人类，都是几百万年之久的发展过程的结果。”（“社会主义从空想到科学的发展”）
    关于达尔文的著作，列宁也曾指出：“达尔文推翻了那认为动植物种类是彼此没有任何联系的偶然的‘神造的’不变的东西的观点，而第一次把生物学放置到完全是科学的基础上来，确定了各物种底变更性以及其间的继承性”（“什么是‘人民之友’”）。斯大林认为达尔文是属于“不管有何等障碍，都能不顾一切而打破旧说，创立新说”的人。（“在克里姆林宫招待高级学校工作人员时的演说”）
    达尔文的这部著作至今还保有其经典著作的价值。它不仅是生物科学工作者的必读书籍，而且也是其他部门工作者的良好读物。特别是在目前宣传辩证唯物主义批判资产阶级唯心主义的斗争中，这部著作更有其现实意义。因为从这里，我们可以看出自然界的一切都是经过千百万年期间按照其本身的自然规律进化发展的结果；更可以看出生物科学和达尔文主义的发展过程，就是唯物主义同唯心主义、辩证法同形而上学、科学中进步革命的一面同落后反动一面的斗争历史。并且，达尔文在这部伟大著作中所表现的实事求是、谦虚诚恳、敢于对陈旧传统和顽固思想进行斗争的那种科学精神，也是值得我们认真学习的。
    但是，必须指出，达尔文学说并不是完整无缺的。马克思列宁主义的经典作家在指出达尔文学说的伟大的意义时，也曾指出达尔文学说中所包含的矛盾和错误。因为达尔文受着方法论上狭隘性的限制，所以他不能摆脱平凡进化论的羁绊。他主张物种同物种之间没有相对的固定界限，因而否定了物种的真实性。达尔文为了解释自然界中所实际存在的物种同物种之间的间断现象，应用了马尔萨斯的人口论的错误观点。他认为由于剧烈的种内斗争的结果，所有的中间类型都因为适应性较差而绝灭了。而种内斗争的引起，在他看来，则是由于自然界中经常产生着某一个物种的个体超过了它们生活的现存条件所允许的范围。由此，达尔文便把种内斗争看成了生物进化的主要动力。这种错误说法，不但为马尔萨斯的人口过剩的反动理论张目，并且也是同他自己所创造的自然选择理论相抵触的。
    但是，在资本主义国家中，达尔文学说遭到了非常敌对的态度。达尔文学说的课程被驱出了学校之外，讲授达尔文学说的人们被当做罪犯来审判。有的科学中的反动分子打着达尔文主义的幌子，对达尔文进行污蔑和歪曲。他们想尽一切可能把达尔文学说中的唯物主义因素加以阉割，而把达尔文学说中的唯心主义因素加以发扬。美国是一个典型的反对达尔文主义的国家。至今在美国的许多州中，达尔文学说仍然被禁止讲授。在解放前的中国，达尔文学说也受到了冷眼看待。当时，在我国的生物学领域中，反动的孟德尔—莫尔根学说占居着支配的地位。不但在学校里没有达尔文学说这门课程，甚至在很大的图书馆里也很难找到达尔文的全部著作。
    只有在社会主义和人民民主国家中，达尔文主义才获得了重视和发展。在苏联，米丘林生物学工作者在其研究工作中，是以达尔文的发展理论为基础的。苏联的达尔文主义是创造性的达尔文主义。米丘林学说把生物科学推进到更高的阶段。事实证明，只有在辩证唯物主义的基础上，达尔文学说中的局限性和缺点才能得到修正。目前在苏联，环绕着物种形成这一问题，正在进行着深刻的研究和广泛的争论。
    新中国的成立使我国的生物科学进入了新的纪元。五年多来，由于党和政府的关怀和领导，我国的生物学界在学习达尔文主义方面获得了很大的收获。但是，胡风集团骨干分子之一谢韬，竟无视我国生物科学在这一方面的成就，而无耻地污蔑说，达尔文的“物种起源”在国民党时翻译了一半，而新中国却一点也没有翻译。胡风分子企图以此来说明我们新中国比反动的国民党统治下的旧中国还要落后。事实却在他那丑恶的脸上打了一个响亮的耳光。我们不但翻译出版了达尔文的“物种起源”，而且达尔文的其他几种主要著作也正在翻译中。今后，在创造性的达尔文主义的指导下，我国的生物科学必将获得更迅速的发展。
