Title: "Is it a "Coal Cinder Heap" or an "Open-pit Mine"?"

To the Editor:

Last August, the expansion project (new power plant) of the First Power Plant of the Xiangzhong Electric Power Bureau was completed, and the machines began to run day and night. From this time on, a large amount of coal cinder was transported out of the plant every day. The coal cinder piles grew higher and higher, and soon, "small mountains" appeared near the factory.

These "small mountains" are so attractive! Every day, there are often thirty or forty people picking out the coal that has not yet been completely burned on them. Whenever the coal cinder is transported out, they swarm up. The coal cinder coming out of the furnace is very hot, and although the workers transporting the coal cinder repeatedly explain that the coal cinder will burn people, no one listens at all. As soon as the coal cinder hits the ground, they fight for it, causing dust to fill the air, and people are often burned as a result. Two months ago, five people were burned, and they were all carried back on stretchers.

Why do people risk danger to scramble for coal cinder? It turns out that picking coal cinder is really profitable. A person can pick a load of burnable coal in just five or six hours. According to incomplete statistics, from October of last year to May of this year, the factory wasted more than 255,000 jin of raw coal due to poor combustion, and the loss of combustibles in fly ash and combustibles within 16 percent in slag has not yet been calculated.

Why has this waste not been overcome for a long time? The leading staff in the factory believe that there is a problem with the equipment, and the grate design is not thorough, with gaps that are too wide; to correct it, the equipment must be improved. The actual situation is not entirely like this. The content of combustibles in the coal cinder of this factory varies greatly due to the operation of different workers, sometimes reaching 31 percent, and sometimes only 10.1 percent. This proves that it is not entirely a "equipment problem." If advanced operating experience can be summarized and promoted in a timely manner, the waste can be greatly reduced before the equipment is improved.

### 是“煤渣堆”还是“露天矿”

　　是“煤渣堆”还是“露天矿”编辑同志：
    去年八月，湘中电业局第一发电厂的扩建工程（新电厂）完成了，机器开始日夜运转。从这时起，每天从厂里运出大量煤渣来。煤渣堆越堆越高，不久以后，厂子附近就出现了一座座的“小山”。
    这些“小山”是多么吸引人啊！每天经常有三、四十人在这上面挑拣还没有燃烧完的煤炭。每当煤渣运出来的时候，他们便一拥而上。刚出炉膛的煤渣热度很高，运煤渣的工人虽然再三说明煤渣会烫人，可是根本没人肯听，煤渣一下地还是你争我夺，闹得飞尘满天，以致经常烫伤人。两个月前就烫伤了五个人，都是用担架抬回去的。
    为什么人们这样不避危险地争夺煤渣呢？原来拣煤渣实在是有利可图，一个人只要花上五、六个钟头，就能拣上一担能烧的煤。据不完全的统计，从去年十月到今年五月，这个厂因为燃烧不良而浪费的原煤量达二十五万五千多斤，飞灰中的可燃物和炉渣里面百分之十六以内的可燃物损失量还没有计算在内。
    为什么长时期不能克服这种浪费呢？厂里的领导工作人员认为是设备上有问题，炉排设计不周，空隙太宽；要纠正就得改善设备。实际情况并不完全是这样。这个厂的煤渣中的可燃物，由于不同的工人的操作含量大有差异，有时达到百分之三十一，有时只是百分之十点一。这就证明并不完全是“设备问题”，如果能够及时总结先进的操作经验，加以推广，在设备没有改善之前，是可以大大地减少浪费的。　胡　彬
