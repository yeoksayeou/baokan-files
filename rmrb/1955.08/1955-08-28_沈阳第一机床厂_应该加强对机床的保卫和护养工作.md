To the Editor:

    The leading staff of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant are politically very apathetic and neglect the security and maintenance of machines, so that some of the newest precision lathes have been severely damaged shortly after installation.

    One of the most valuable pieces of equipment in our country today, a 1622 advanced precision Soviet-made lead screw lathe in the 1A62 machining workshop, was handed over to Zhang Jiakai, a hidden counter-revolutionary element, by the workshop's leading staff. Zhang Jiakai seized this opportunity to carry out sabotage. When processing a four-lead screw, he failed to produce qualified products for a long time, hindering the trial production of new products. To solve this problem, a Soviet expert personally sharpened a tool for this lathe, but Zhang Jiakai deliberately ruined it. The large lead screws processed by Zhang Jiakai often turned out to be defective, and the workshop's leading staff only thought he was "technically unskilled" and "careless," so they asked the Soviet expert to sharpen another tool for the lathe. After this, although finished products were produced, the tool was soon damaged again. However, these facts did not attract the attention of the personnel concerned, and Zhang Jiakai became bolder and bolder, eventually damaging the 1622 machine tool. Although this counter-revolutionary element has now been arrested, he has already caused enormous losses to our construction efforts.

    In addition, this factory often has accidents because it neglects the maintenance of machine tools. In April of this year, a large hexagonal lathe in the 1A62 workshop was in production when worker Shang Jinglong discovered that the sound of the bed was abnormal. He immediately stopped the machine and went to find the section chief, Bian Siming. But Bian Siming said, "It doesn't matter, keep working!" A few hours later, this new machine broke down. A Soviet-style large surface grinder in this factory had an uneven bed surface after installation, and the workshop's chief engineer, Lu Chunru, even ground a cut off the bed surface, destroying the machine's precision.

    The leading staff of this factory not only turned a blind eye to such serious damage to the new machines, but some even supported certain wrong behaviors. Some workers violated operating procedures, leaving their work posts while the machines were running. When machine operator Ma Linshu discovered this, he reported it to the section chief, Jiang Runtian. Jiang Runtian did not believe him and said, "Impossible! How could the machine be running and the person walk away?" When the worker himself admitted his mistake, he said, "Didn't the machine get damaged? Then it doesn't matter!" Many section chiefs, in order to rush production tasks, did not hesitate to violate the machine tool usage system (workers must pass an exam to use machine tools), and ordered workers who had not passed the exam to operate them, resulting in accidents everywhere. Since the 1A62 workshop began production in January, almost all of the 140-odd lathes in the workshop have experienced accidents of varying degrees; the power workshop had 14 accidents in June alone; and the gear workshop also had many accidents.

    The Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant's attitude towards new equipment is intolerable, and this wrong behavior must be stopped immediately!

### 沈阳第一机床厂  应该加强对机床的保卫和护养工作

    沈阳第一机床厂
    应该加强对机床的保卫和护养工作编辑同志：
    沈阳第一机床厂的领导工作人员政治上十分麻痹，忽视机器的保卫和护养工作，以致有些最新式的精密车床，安装不久就遭到严重的破坏和损害。
    这个工厂一A六二加工车间的一台一六二二高级精密苏式丝杠车床，是目前我国最贵重的设备之一，可是车间的领导工作人员竟把它交给一个暗藏的反革命分子——张家凯操纵。张家凯就抓住这个机会进行破坏。他在加工四头旋丝时，很长时间没有生产出合格品，使新产品试制工作受到阻碍。苏联专家为了解决这个问题，亲自替这台车床磨了一把刀，张家凯又故意把这把刀使坏了。张家凯加工的大丝杠经常出废品，车间的领导工作人员只是认为他“技术不高”、“工作马虎”，因此请苏联专家再给这台车床磨把刀。在这以后，虽然加工出了成品，可是不久刀又坏了。可是这些事实却没有引起有关人员的注意，张家凯的胆子也就越来越大，竟把这台一六二二机床破坏了。现在这个反革命分子虽然已经被捕，但是他已经给我们的建设事业造成了巨大的损失。
    此外，这个工厂由于忽视对机床的护养，经常发生事故。今年四月间，一A六二车间一台大六角车床正在进行生产，工人尚景隆发现床子的声音不正常，立刻停车去找工段长卞思明。可是卞思明说：“不要紧，干吧！”几小时以后，这台新机器就坏了。这个厂的一台苏式大平磨床，安装后床面不平，车间的总工长陆春儒竟把床面磨去一刀，破坏了机床的精密度。
    对于新机器遭到这样严重的破坏和损害，这个工厂的领导工作人员不但熟视无睹，有些人甚至还支持某些错误行为。有的工人违犯操作规程，机器开着，人竟离开工作岗位，机器员马林书发现这种情况后报告了工段长蒋润田。蒋润田却不相信地说：“不能啊！那能车开着人走开呢？”当工人自己承认错误时，他又说：“不是没有碰坏机器吗？这就不要紧！”很多工段长为了赶生产任务，不惜违犯机床使用制度（工人使用机床必须经过考试合格），叫未经考试的工人操纵，因而到处发生事故。一A六二车间从一月份投入生产以来，全车间一百四十几台车床几乎都发生过程度不同的事故；动力车间仅六月份就发生十四次事故；齿轮车间的事故也很多。
    沈阳第一机床厂这种对待新设备的态度是不能容忍的，必须立刻制止这种错误行为！
