Jiangsu Province Expects Bumper Harvest of Over 70 Million Mu of Autumn Crops
Zhejiang Province Reports General Increase in Early Rice Production from Double-Cropping

Jiangsu Province expects a bumper harvest of over 70 million mu of autumn crops. Of the 32 million mu of rice in the province, early rice harvesting has begun on more than 4 million mu. In high-yield areas of Fengxian County, the average yield is around 650 jin per mu. In the Lixiahe area, the estimated yield of early rice is nearly 400 jin per mu, higher than in any previous year. Most of the mid-season rice in various regions has already headed and flowered, while late rice is currently growing and in the booting stage. Of the 10 million mu of cotton in the province, 70% has already flowered, and even the late-planted cotton has begun to bud.

In northern Jiangsu, except for a few areas recently affected by heavy rain, the tall sorghum heads have already turned red. In the northern Tongshan County area, sorghum stalks are generally half a chi to one chi taller than last year. It is estimated that the average yield per mu can reach about 200 jin, and in some cases, over 300 jin. The over 12 million mu of soybeans are laden with pods, and it is estimated that the yield of well-grown soybeans can reach 200 jin per mu. Early corn with plump kernels has begun to be harvested. The vines in peanut and sweet potato fields have completely covered the ridges, and early peanuts have begun to bear fruit.

The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has called on Party organizations at all levels to mobilize farmers to continue strengthening field management, resolutely overcome the complacent mindset of "a guaranteed harvest," strengthen wind prevention, pest control, and water conservancy work, and harvest in a timely manner to ensure a bumper harvest.

Zhejiang Province expanded the planting of double-cropped rice by approximately 800,000 mu this year. The early rice harvest is underway, with yields generally increasing by more than 20% compared to last year. The Wenzhou Special District expanded the planting of double-cropped rice by 350,000 mu, with early rice yields generally increasing by 130 to 150 jin per mu compared to last year. According to typical surveys in the Ningbo Special District, the yield of early rice from double-cropped rice reached approximately 450 jin per mu.

Double-cropping rice has a high yield, but it requires good water conservancy, sufficient fertilizer, abundant labor, and strong technical skills. The great development of the agricultural cooperation movement in Zhejiang Province last winter and this spring created conditions for expanding the planting of double-cropped rice. The planting area of double-cropped rice in the province was over 200,000 mu last year, and has increased to approximately 1 million mu this year.

Of the approximately 800,000 mu expanded this year, more than 70% was planted by agricultural production cooperatives in various regions. This year, the early rice yield of double-cropped rice in many agricultural production cooperatives is the highest yield in the local area. The Dongfanghong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shangyu County, the Shushan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiaoshan County, and the Xiyi Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Wenzhou City have all set records for early rice yields of over 600 jin per mu. The Minzhu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shangyu County experimented with planting over one mu of double-cropped rice, and after harvesting five full dan of wet rice, the news spread rapidly, and many farmers rushed to the threshing floor to watch and ask questions. Individual farmer Wang Bingxian and his son discussed after seeing it: "We are determined to join the cooperative after the autumn harvest." (Xinhua News Agency)

Chongqing Factories and Mines Formulate Conservation Measures

Factories and mines in Chongqing have initially formulated concrete measures for comprehensively increasing production and practicing economy. They plan to increase production and save over 36 million yuan for the state in the second half of the year. Chongqing No. 2 Iron and Steel Plant plans to increase steel ingot production by 5,000 tons and steel production by 1,800 tons in the second half of the year, and to increase profit delivery and save 1.5 million yuan in funds. Chongqing No. 3 Iron and Steel Plant can increase production by over 6 million yuan for the state just by increasing the production of tie plates to support Anshan Iron and Steel's heavy rail production. Sichuan Cement Plant can save over 200,000 yuan by reducing the consumption of raw and auxiliary materials and reducing management and transportation costs. The five factories in the textile system plan to save electricity and reduce costs in addition to continuing to save cotton and yarn, and to save another 2.9 million yuan for the state.

Gansu Design Company Carefully Revises Designs

The Gansu Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau Design Company recently revised and changed the designs of 29 construction projects, saving the state over 2.4 million yuan.

Most of these 29 projects are office buildings, auditoriums, warehouses, classrooms, dining halls, and dormitories. Some are under construction or about to be constructed, and some are nearing completion. Under the premise of not affecting the construction period, the designers have revised the designs of these projects to the extent possible based on the principles of practicality, economy, and appropriate attention to aesthetics. Some projects with higher design standards have had their standards lowered according to the specific situation. For example, single-story houses with high-grade brick and wood structures have been changed to adobe and wood structures, multi-story mixed-structure dormitories have been changed to single-story adobe and wood structures, cement floors have been changed to brick floors, and green bricks on one- to three-story buildings have been changed to red bricks, etc. This has greatly reduced the cost of construction. After adopting the above measures for the warehouse project of the Bayi Printing Factory, the unit price has been reduced from 75 yuan to 50 yuan. Decorative parts of some projects have been reduced as much as possible, and inexpensive building materials have been used to replace expensive ones. For the auditorium of the Northwest Nationalities Institute, most of the artificial stone exterior plastering was changed to cement plastering, and some false decorations in the balconies and main hall were removed, reducing the project cost by 3% and shortening the construction period accordingly.

Andong Local Industry Trial-Manufactures New Agricultural and Fishery Production Tools

Starting in July, Andong City's local industries began trial-manufacturing thirteen new types of production tools for agricultural and fishery production. Before the trial manufacture, the Andong City Industry Bureau organized a survey team to conduct in-depth visits to rural areas in the suburbs and listen to the opinions of farmers and fishermen. The potato harvesters, threshers, rice harvesters, etc., which are currently being trial-manufactured, are being trial-manufactured according to the current needs of farmers. Net-making machines needed by coastal fishermen, winches for raising anchors and hauling nets on fishing boats, and booms for unloading goods on medium and large fishing boats are also being trial-manufactured. After these semi-mechanized or semi-automated production tools are successfully trial-manufactured, they will greatly reduce the physical labor of farmers and fishermen in production.

Ulapo Hydropower Station Completed

The Ulapo Hydropower Station, a newly built automated hydropower station in Xinjiang Province, was completed in June. Currently, lines are being laid, and it can begin supplying electricity to some factories and residents in Urumqi City in the early fourth quarter of this year.

The Ulapo Hydropower Station was started by the Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in 1951. The entire project includes more than ten projects, including a dam, aqueduct, gate dam, drainage channel, flood control dike, water transmission pipe, and substation. The entire production process of this power station is automated. (Our collective correspondent, editorial department of the Xinjiang Production Front newspaper)

Harbin Railway Administration Achieves Success in Non-Stop Competition at Intermediate Stations

Since advanced drivers Ma Yupu and Sun Shigui operated the first non-stop train through an intermediate station at the end of 1954, the Harbin Railway Administration has launched a non-stop competition at intermediate stations throughout the bureau. From January 1 to July 20 this year, the bureau operated a total of 11,325 non-stop trains through intermediate stations, with an average train operating speed of 27.7 kilometers per hour, an increase of 3 kilometers compared to the same period in 1954, and the bureau saved 17,600 tons of coal. Now, other railway administrations are also implementing the method of non-stop trains through intermediate stations. (Li Wenguo)

    江苏省七千多万亩秋熟作物丰收在望
    浙江省双季连作稻的早稻普遍增产
    江苏省七千多万亩秋熟作物丰收在望。全省三千二百万亩水稻中四百多万亩早稻已开始收割，奉贤县高产地区一般每亩收六百五十斤左右。里下河地区的早稻估计每亩收成近四百斤，产量比以往任何一年都高。各地中稻大部分已抽穗扬花，晚稻正在发棵孕穗。全省一千多万亩棉花，百分之七十已经开花，出苗较迟的也已开始现蕾。
    在江苏北部，除最近有暴雨的个别地区外，高大的高粱穗头已经发红。铜山县北部一带的高粱秸一般比去年高半尺到一尺。据估计，每亩产量一般可达二百斤左右，好的可收三百多斤。一千二百多万亩大豆已经荚角累累，长得好的估计每亩产量可达二百斤。籽粒饱满的早玉米已经开始摘收。花生和山芋（红薯）地里的藤蔓已经把田垅都盖满了，早花生已经开始结果。
    中共江苏省委员会号召各级党的组织，发动农民继续加强田间管理，坚决克服“丰收已定”的麻痹思想，加强防风、治虫以及水利工作，及时收割，确保丰收。　（新华社）
    浙江省今年扩大种植双季连作稻约八十万亩，目前早稻陆续收获，普遍比去年增产两成以上。温州专区扩大种植双季连作稻三十五万亩，早稻每亩一般比去年增产一百三十斤到一百五十斤。宁波专区双季连作稻的早稻，据典型调查每亩产量达到四百五十斤左右。
    双季连作稻产量高，但种植双季连作稻需要水利好，肥料足，劳力多，技术强。去冬今春浙江省农业合作化运动的大发展，为扩大种植双季连作稻创造了条件。全省双季连作稻的种植面积去年是二十多万亩，今年已发展到一百万亩左右。
    今年扩大的约八十万亩，百分之七十以上都是各地农业生产合作社种植的。今年许多农业生产合作社双季连作稻的早稻产量，都是当地最高的产量。上虞县东方红农业生产合作社、萧山县蜀山农业生产合作社、温州市郊西一农业生产合作社种的双季连作稻，都创造了每亩早稻收六百斤以上的丰产纪录。上虞县民主农业生产合作社试种双季连作稻一亩多，当早稻收了五满担湿谷后，村里一传十、十传百，许多农民赶到晒谷场连看带问。单干农民王炳仙和他的儿子看后就商量：“下定决心，秋后一定要求入社”。　（新华社）
    重庆厂矿企业制定节约措施
    重庆市各厂矿企业已经初步制定出全面增产节约具体措施，下半年计划为国家增产节约三千六百多万元。重庆第二钢铁厂计划下半年增产钢锭五千吨、钢材一千八百吨，并增交上缴利润和节约资金一百五十万元。重庆第三钢铁厂仅配合鞍钢重轨生产增产垫板一项，就可为国家增产六百多万元。四川水泥厂降低原材料和辅助材料的消耗，减少管理运输费用，可以节约二十多万元。纺织系统五个厂，除继续节约用棉、用纱外，还计划节约用电，降低成本，再为国家节约二百九十多万元。

    甘肃设计公司认真修改设计
    甘肃省建筑工程局设计公司最近修改和变更了二十九项工程设计，为国家节约二百四十多万元。
    这二十九项工程大部分是办公楼、礼堂、仓库、教室、饭厅、宿舍，有的正在施工和即将施工，有的已经接近完工。设计工作者在不影响工期的前提下，根据实用、经济和适当注意美观的原则，对这些工程的设计在可能范围内进行了修改。一些设计标准较高的工程，已经分别情况降低标准。如将高等砖木结构的平房改为土坯木结构，混合结构的楼房宿舍改为土坯木结构的平房，水泥地坪改为方砖地坪，一至三层楼的青砖改为红砖等。这样就大大地降低了工程造价。八一印刷厂仓库的工程，采取上述一些措施以后，单价已经由七十五元降低到五十元。若干工程上的装饰部分，已经尽可能地加以减少，一些价格高贵的建筑材料也尽量用廉价的代替。西北民族学院大礼堂，把大部分斩假石外粉刷改为水泥粉刷，把阳台、正厅等处的一些虚假装饰等去掉以后，工程造价降低了百分之三，工期也因此大为缩短。　（本报驻兰州记者）
    安东地方工业试制新的农业渔业生产工具
    安东市地方工业七月份开始为农、渔业生产试制十三种新的生产工具。试制以前，安东市工业局曾经组织一个调查组，深入郊区农村进行访问，听取了农民、渔民的意见。正在试制中的马铃薯收割机、脱谷机、水稻收割机等，就是根据农民目前的需要试制的。沿海渔民需要的织网机，渔帆起锚拉网用的卷扬机和大中型渔船卸装货物用的吊杆等，也正在试制。这些半机械化或半自动化的生产工具试制成功以后，将大大减轻农民、渔民生产中的体力劳动。　（本报驻沈阳记者）
    乌拉泊水力发电站修建完工
    新疆省新建的一座自动化水力发电站——乌拉泊水力发电站已经在六月间建成。目前正在架设线路，今年第四季度初可以开始供给乌鲁木齐市部分工厂和市民用电。
    乌拉泊水力发电站是中国人民解放军新疆军区生产建设部队在一九五一年开始兴建的。全部工程包括拦河坝、渡槽、闸坝、排水道、防洪堤、输水管和变电站等十多项工程。这个发电站的全部生产过程都是自动化的。
