Xinhua News Agency, 19th Dispatch: The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League recently issued an "Instruction on Studying and Publicizing the Important Documents of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress and Ensuring the Struggle for the Complete Realization of the First Five-Year Plan" to local organizations at all levels.

The instruction stated: League organizations at all levels should, under the unified leadership and arrangements of the local Communist Party organizations and governments, mobilize and organize members and the masses they are connected with to earnestly study and publicize the First Five-Year Plan and other resolutions and documents adopted by the Second Session of the National People's Congress, and ensure that they strive for their realization.

The instruction stated: With the progress of the socialist transformation cause, imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and all elements hostile to the people will inevitably try every possible means to undermine our Five-Year Plan and the people's democratic dictatorship. All league members must constantly heighten their political vigilance, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, strive to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, defeat any form of sabotage by domestic and foreign enemies and reactionaries, and temper and improve themselves in this struggle.

The instruction believes: The China Democratic League has a special task focusing on cultural and educational work. Therefore, all league members must deeply understand the inseparable relationship between socialist economic construction and socialist ideological construction. We must first improve our political and ideological level, strengthen ideological transformation, thoroughly criticize bourgeois idealist ideology, consciously strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, learn to master the ideological weapon of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and correct all tendencies to neglect politics.

According to Xinhua News Agency: The Fifth Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, recently held, adopted an instruction calling on its subordinate organizations and members to strive to implement the important resolutions passed by the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, such as the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy.

The instruction stated: The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association fully supports the resolutions passed at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress regarding the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of China's National Economy. All levels of organizations and all members of the China Democratic National Construction Association must, with the highest loyalty and greatest determination, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, work together with the people of the whole country to strive for the implementation of these historic resolutions.

The instruction stated: The China Democratic National Construction Association should more effectively and systematically cultivate and improve the industrial and commercial members of the Democratic National Construction Association to become the backbone elements in the industrial and commercial circles in order to meet the specific requirements of the First Five-Year Plan. To this end, members of the Democratic National Construction Association, especially industrial and commercial members, should achieve the following points in terms of understanding and practice: (1) Consciously and actively, consistently in word and deed, abide by national laws, obey national plans, oppose the idea of blind capitalist operation, obey the management of state administrative organs and the leadership of the state-owned economy, and accept the supervision of the working masses; (2) Not only should their enterprises actively accept national arrangements and transformations, but they should also do their best to assist the government in making good arrangements and transformation work for enterprises. When the state needs to adopt reorganization and transformation measures such as "large enterprises leading small enterprises, advanced enterprises leading backward enterprises," they should abandon their concerns and take the initiative to play a leading and bridging role; (3) Actively improve business management, improve production technology, improve product quality, save raw materials, reduce production costs, and promote the campaign to increase production and practice economy throughout the enterprise; (4) Improve political understanding, draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves, strengthen propaganda and education on eliminating counter-revolutionaries in the industrial and commercial circles, mobilize and organize as many of the masses in the industrial and commercial circles as possible to join the ranks of the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, and assist the government in exposing and eliminating all hidden counter-revolutionaries; (5) Fully reflect the new situations and problems encountered by the industrial and commercial circles in the process of accepting socialist transformation, as well as some new opinions and requirements, and represent their legitimate interests. Analyze and study these situations and opinions, and conduct explanations, discussions, and persuasive education among members and in the industrial and commercial circles. When necessary, suggestions should also be made to the government to assist the government in solving these problems. Serious criticism and struggle should be carried out in a timely manner against various illegal activities in the industrial and commercial circles.
