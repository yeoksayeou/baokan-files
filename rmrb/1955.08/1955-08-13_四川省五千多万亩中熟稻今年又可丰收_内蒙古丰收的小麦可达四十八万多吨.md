Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 11th: Field measurements in many areas of Sichuan Province indicate that the per-unit yield of the province's over fifty million mu of medium-season rice will exceed previous years. In the famous rice-producing area of the province, the Dujiangyan Irrigation Area, with its four million mu of rice paddies, the rice generally grows stronger, has more roots, better color, and earlier heading than last year. A recent field estimate by twenty-five agricultural production cooperatives in Gongping Township, Wenjiang County, suggests a 5% increase in production compared to last year. Production measurements in the Wenwu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Linfeng Township, Jiangjin County, indicate a 30% increase over last year.

According to personnel from the Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture, Sichuan Province has had five consecutive years of bumper harvests since liberation; barring unforeseen disasters, another bumper harvest is expected this year. Harvesting of medium-season rice is expected to begin in mid-August in various areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, August 10th: Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's over seven million six hundred thousand mu of wheat is reporting another bumper harvest this year. The total wheat yield in the region is estimated to reach over 480,000 tons. Currently, most areas have completed harvesting, with the exception of wheat in Ergune Banner and the high-altitude cold regions north of the Daqing Mountains, which is about to be harvested.

Wheat yields in the Hulunbuir League and the Xiliao River basin in the northeastern part of the autonomous region exceeded the originally planned output by about 10%. In the Hetao region of the Yellow River in the west, each hectare (fifteen mu) yielded fifty kilograms more than last year. Zhaowuda League, Ik Zhao League, and Chahar League all exceeded last year's harvest. The Yusheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Balinyouqi Banner, Zhaowuda League, used seed drills to sow wheat this year, doubling the number of rows and increasing the number of plants by one-third, resulting in an average yield of over 900 jin more per hectare than wheat sown in wide rows.
