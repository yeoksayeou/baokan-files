Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 14th: "Thomas Mann, a distinguished contemporary German writer and humanist, passed away in Zurich, Switzerland, on August 12th at the age of eighty." This is a significant loss not only for Germany but also for the progressive literary world worldwide.

On June 6th this year, Thomas Mann celebrated his eightieth birthday, and progressive writers from all over the world sent him heartfelt congratulations: for his continuous creative labor of sixty years, which enriched the world's literary treasure trove; for his resolute anti-fascist struggle during the two world wars; for his sympathy for the Soviet Union and his disdain for the power politics of the United States; for his vigorous efforts at the high age of eighty to strive for world peace and German unification. The sounds of congratulations had not yet faded away when we suddenly heard the sad news of his death, which makes everyone feel even more grief-stricken.

In 1875, Thomas Mann was born into a merchant's family in the city of Lübeck in northern Germany. Thomas Mann's youth coincided with the era when German capitalism was entering the stage of imperialism, and it was also the era when the progressive elements of the bourgeoisie gradually disappeared, while the corrupt and decadent elements grew day by day. The background of this era determined the theme in Thomas Mann's works; in his outstanding novels, he reflected the rise, development, and decline of the bourgeoisie, as well as the various decadent and abnormal phenomena of this class in its decline.

At the age of twenty-five, he wrote his world-famous first novel: "Buddenbrooks." This novel profoundly describes the rise and fall of three generations of a merchant family and has become a model of German critical realism literature. At the same time, he said that the success of this novel was due to the great influence of great Russian literature. Since then, he has continuously published many novels, novellas, and short stories, mainly reflecting the various morbidities of the declining period of the bourgeoisie. "The Magic Mountain," published in 1924, paints a grand picture of the decadent culture of the European bourgeoisie before the First World War.

After Hitler seized power, Thomas Mann fled to foreign countries and eventually arrived in the United States. He used his rich, colorful, sharp, and powerful words to launch a fierce struggle against barbaric fascism. At the same time, he completed the trilogy "Joseph and His Brothers" (1933-1943), which was based on Hebrew legends. When the fascist bandits were rampant and shameless in Germany, Thomas Mann published "Lotte in Weimar" in 1937, using the image of Goethe to embody the progressive tradition of German humanism. After the Second World War, "Doctor Faustus," published in 1947, like many of his works in his prime, once again, but more profoundly, wrote about the tragedy encountered by an artist in the era of imperialism.

Thomas Mann keenly felt and recognized the various defects and contradictions in capitalist society, but he was unable to move closer to the ranks of the working class as clearly as his brother Heinrich Mann (1871-1950). However, whenever important events occurred in the world, he always stood on the side of progress and supported the forces of progress. He resolutely opposed the fascization not only of his own country but of any country; in the second half of World War II, he condemned Britain and the United States for not opening a second battlefield quickly, and he saw that the American imperialists were already preparing for the next anti-Soviet war; he signed the Stockholm declaration banning atomic bombs; in 1952, he could no longer tolerate the fascization of the United States, so he permanently left the United States and returned to Europe.

Thomas Mann's works are printed in large quantities in the German Democratic Republic. He returned to Weimar twice—once to participate in the bicentennial commemoration of Goethe's birth in 1949, and once to participate in this year's 150th anniversary of Schiller's death—and both times he was warmly welcomed by the government and people of the German Democratic Republic. The German people are proud of Thomas Mann's existence because he represents Germany's long-standing progressive tradition of humanism.

For our friendly nation, the German Democratic Republic, for the common cause that Chinese and German writers are striving for, and for the progressive literature of the world, we express our deepest condolences on the death of Thomas Mann. (Attached picture)

    悼托马斯·曼 
    冯至
    新华社柏林十四日电称：“当代杰出的德国作家、人道主义者托马斯·曼八月十二日在瑞士苏黎世逝世，享年八十岁。”这不只是德国的、而且是全世界的进步文艺界一个重大的损失。
    今年六月六日，是托马斯·曼八十岁的寿辰，全世界各地的进步作家曾经向他致送过衷心的祝贺：为了他六十年之久不断的创作劳动，丰富了世界的文学宝库；为了他在两次世界大战中间反法西斯的坚决斗争；为了他对于苏联的同情和对于美国实力政策的鄙视；为了他在八十岁的高龄还精神饱满地为争取世界和平和德国统一而努力。祝贺的呼声还没有消逝，忽然又听到他去世的哀音，大家的心里是会感到倍加哀痛的。
    一八七五年，托马斯·曼生在德国北部吕贝克城一个商人的家庭里。托马斯·曼的青年期，正是德国资本主义走入帝国主义的时代，也正是资产阶级进步的成分逐渐消亡，而腐化堕落的成分日渐孳长的时代。这时代的背景决定了托马斯·曼作品中的主题；他在他杰出的小说里反映出资产阶级的上升、发展和没落，以及这个阶级在没落时种种颓废和反常的现象。
    他二十五岁时，就写出他世界闻名的第一部小说：“布登卜鲁克家族”。这部小说深刻地描述了一个商人家族祖孙三代的兴衰隆替，成为德国批判的现实主义文学中的典范。同时他说，这部小说的成功是由于伟大的俄罗斯文学所给予他的巨大影响。此后他不断地发表许多长篇、中篇、短篇，主要是反映资产阶级没落期的种种病态。一九二四年出版的“魔山”给第一次世界大战前欧洲资产阶级腐朽的文化描画出一幅规模宏大的画图。
    希特勒篡夺政权后，托马斯·曼流亡到外国，最后到了美国。他用他丰富多采、尖锐有力的文字向野蛮的法西斯展开剧烈的斗争。同时他完成了取材于希伯来传说的巨著“约瑟和他的兄弟们”三部曲（一九三三—一九四三）。当法西斯匪徒在德国猖狂无耻地横行霸道时，托马斯·曼在一九三七年发表了“绿蒂在魏玛”，他用歌德的形象体现出德国人道主义的进步传统。第二次大战后，一九四七年出版了“浮士德博士”，这部小说和他壮年时的许多作品一样，再一度地、却是更深刻地写出一个艺术家在帝国主义时代中遭遇到的悲剧。
    托马斯·曼痛切地感到、而且认识到资本主义社会中的种种缺陷和矛盾，但是他没有能够像他的哥哥海因利希·曼那样（一八七一—一九五○），进一步明确地靠拢工人阶级的队伍。但是每逢世界上的重要事件，他总是站在进步方面，支持进步的力量。他坚决反对不只是他本国的、而且是任何一个国家的法西斯化；第二次世界大战的后半期，他谴责英国和美国不迅速开辟第二战场，并且他看出来美帝国主义者已经是在准备着下一次的反苏战争；他在斯德哥尔摩禁用原子弹的宣言上签了名；一九五二年，他看着美国的法西斯化再也不能容忍，于是永久地离开了美国，回到欧洲。
    托马斯·曼的作品在德意志民主共和国大量地印行。他两次回到魏玛——一次参加一九四九年歌德诞生二百年纪念，一次参加今年的席勒逝世一百五十年纪念——都受到德意志民主共和国政府和人民盛大的欢迎。德国人民为了托马斯·曼的存在感到自豪，因为他代表了德国悠久的人道主义的进步传统。
    为了我们的友邦德意志民主共和国，为了中国作家和德国作家所努力的共同事业，为了全世界的进步文学，我们对于托马斯·曼的逝世致以深切的哀悼。（附图片）
