　　Endorse the Provisional Measures for Rationed Grain Supply in Cities and Towns
　　A Fundamental Solution to Urban Grain Supply
　　Wang Kewen, Vice Mayor of Wuhan City
    The implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain has enabled the state to completely control the grain market, uniformly manage the allocation and transportation of grain, powerfully strike at speculative grain merchants, guarantee the grain needs of cities and industry, and promote agricultural production and the socialist transformation of agriculture. The people of Wuhan City have drawn a conclusion based on their own personal experiences: unified purchase and sale ensures the living needs of the broad masses of the people. Middle-aged and older people in Wuhan City, whenever they talk about grain, naturally compare the situation in 1931 with that in 1954: In 1931, during the great flood, when the Yangtze River water level rose to 26.94 meters, the river堤 broke, the entire city was flooded, and grain prices soared by 1.2 times, and supply was insufficient. Even if one had money, it was difficult to buy, while unscrupulous merchants who hoarded and speculated made a fortune. In 1954, the Yangtze River water level was 2.79 meters higher than the water level when the river堤 broke in 1931, but Wuhan City stood firm, overcame the great flood, grain prices remained stable, and grain supply was as usual. Everyone unanimously recognized that this was the benefit of unified purchase and sale of grain. It is no accident that the broad masses of the people wholeheartedly endorse and resolutely implement various measures for the unified purchase and sale of grain. Now that the State Council has issued the Provisional Measures for Rationed Grain Supply in Cities and Towns, this is a new development in the planned grain supply in cities, and it will further overcome the loopholes and shortcomings in the current urban grain supply, ensuring a more rational supply. It will similarly be endorsed by the people of Wuhan City and the entire country.
    In recent months, the method of verifying and planning supply by household implemented in Wuhan City is a step forward compared to the past method of grain departments "internally controlling sales plans and the masses freely purchasing grain," but there are still significant waste and loopholes. The actual sales volume in April this year exceeded the planned sales volume by 26.8 percent. Starting in May, the city carried out a rectification of grain sales, implemented planned supply verified by household, and conducted propaganda and education on saving grain to the people of the city. As a result, the total grain sales in May decreased by 11.21 percent compared to April, and decreased month by month in June and July. The average sales in July decreased by 14.7 percent compared to the average sales from October last year to March this year. Facts have proven that the planned supply verified by household has curbed the phenomenon of excessive and rapid increase in grain sales in the past, which broke through the state's planned supply, and stabilized the tense situation of grain supply. However, if we still remain at this supply method, our achievements in planned grain supply cannot be consolidated. In urban areas, changes in grain consumption and waste caused by population mobility and changes in occupation are significant. In this change, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to increase or decrease the grain consumption plan; at the same time, because there is no fixed standard, the phenomenon of vying for more and demanding less and irrationality is unavoidable. At the same time, there is a lack of a unified quantitative standard for household verification of supply between regions and streets, so naturally there will be phenomena of either loose or tight. The implementation of the measures for rationed grain supply in cities and towns can further institutionalize grain supply and overcome the above-mentioned unreasonable phenomena.
    The standard for rationed supply is also completely in line with the actual situation. According to calculations, the quantitative standard stipulated in the measures is generally about 4 percent higher than the current number of plans verified by household in Wuhan City. Trial calculations using the prescribed standards in the streets show that most residents' grain rations should be higher than the current grain plan verified by household, and only a few people have reduced them, but most of the people who have reduced them originally had a larger number in their household plan. The implementation of the method of supplying fixed quantities per person is actually equivalent to a wide and reasonable adjustment to the past supply. This new quantitative standard can be said to be a sufficient supply standard, which meets the needs of people's health and is a method of taking full responsibility for the necessary supply of the people.
    Some people say: the quantitative standard is appropriate, but the procedures are cumbersome. This is not right. Of course, in our specific work, we should always pay attention to the simplicity of procedures and give people as much convenience as possible, but without necessary procedures, it is impossible to guarantee the implementation of the measures. It is necessary to have a certificate to purchase grain, there must be a certain location, and procedures for transferring grain purchase relations must be carried out when the population changes. The people already have the habit of planned supply, and there will be no difficulty in implementing various methods of rationed supply. Only those who attempt to obtain exorbitant profits in the free grain market will oppose these necessary procedures and methods.
    Counter-revolutionary elements and people with ulterior motives will inevitably try every means to oppose and sabotage rationed supply. They will certainly take advantage of the tension caused by the fact that some people do not yet understand the benefits of rationed supply to spread rumors and create trouble. All staff and the general public must expose these sabotage activities. The broad masses of the people will recognize the superiority of rationed supply based on their own personal experience, and thus actively ensure the implementation of this method.
    Implementing rationed supply is a meticulous task, and it should be done carefully from the beginning. The classification and grading must be realistic, and subjective carelessness will inevitably be opposed by the masses, and the requirements of institutionalizing grain supply cannot be met. We must learn from the past lessons in grain supply, deeply understand the situation, and on the basis of existing experience, make this grain rationed supply work better.

### 拥护市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法　解决城市粮食供应的根本办法

　　拥护市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法
　　解决城市粮食供应的根本办法
　　武汉市副市长　王克文
    粮食统购统销政策的实施，使国家完全控制了粮食市场，统一管理了粮食的调运，有力地打击了投机粮商，保证了城市和工业的粮食需要，促进了农业生产和农业的社会主义改造。武汉市人民根据自己的切身经验得出一个结论：统购统销保障了广大人民的生活需要。武汉市的中年以上的人，每逢谈到粮食，就很自然地对比起一九三一年和一九五四年的情况：一九三一年大水，长江水位涨到二六点九四公尺时，江堤决口，全市被淹，粮价暴涨了一点二倍，而且供应不足，即使有钱也难买到，囤积居奇的奸商则大发其财。一九五四年长江水位高于一九三一年决口时的水位二点七九公尺，武汉市屹立未动，战胜了大洪水，粮价稳定，粮食供应如常。大家一致认识到这就是粮食统购统销的好处。广大人民竭诚拥护并坚决执行粮食统购统销的各种措施，决不是偶然的。现在国务院发布了市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法，这是城市粮食计划供应的新发展，它将进一步克服目前城镇粮食供应方面的漏洞和缺点，保证更合理的供应，它同样会得到武汉市以至全国人民的拥护。
    最近数月来，武汉市实行的按户核实计划供应办法，较之过去粮食部门“内部掌握销售计划、群众随意购粮”的供应办法是前进了一步，但仍有很大的浪费和漏洞。今年四月的实销量，超过了计划销量的百分之二十六点八。五月份起，全市进行了粮食销售整顿，实行了按户核实计划供应，并向全市人民进行了节约粮食的宣传教育。这样五月份粮食的总销量就较四月份下降了百分之十一点二一，六、七月份逐月下降，七月份的平均销量比去年十月至今年三月平均销量下降了百分之十四点七。事实证明：按户核实计划供应，制止了过去粮食销量增加过多过快因而突破国家计划供应的现象，稳定了粮食供应的紧张情况。但是如果仍停留在这种供应办法上，我们的粮食计划供应的成就，仍是不能巩固的。城镇中由于人口流动、职业改变而引起的吃粮变化和浪费是很大的。在这种变化中，用粮计划核增核减费人费时；同时因无固定标准，发生争多叫少和不尽合理的现象，也就难以避免。同时，各地区，各街道之间，由于按户核实供应缺乏统一的定量标准，自然也就不免有或松或紧的现象发生。市镇粮食定量供应办法的实行，就可以使粮食供应进一步制度化，克服上述一些不合理现象。
    定量供应的标准也是完全合乎实际情况的，据计算，办法中规定的定量标准，较武汉市现行的按户核实计划的数目，一般约多百分之四左右。街道中用规定标准试算，大部分居民应购口粮较现行的按户核实的用粮计划都有提高，只有个别的人降低了些，但降低了的人，大多数原来按户计划的数字就偏大。实行以人定量供应办法实际上等于对过去的供应进行了广泛合理的调整。这一新的定量标准，可以说是一种足量的供应标准，是合乎人民健康的需要的，是对人民必需供应采取完全负责态度的办法。
    有人说：定量标准是适当的，但手续麻烦。这是不对的。当然，我们在具体工作中，应该经常注意到手续的简便，尽量给人民以方便，但没有必要的手续，也就不可能保证办法的贯彻执行。购粮必须凭证，必须有一定的地点，人口异动要带着转移购粮关系的手续等，这些都是必要的。人民已有了计划供应的习惯，对于执行定量供应的各种办法也是不会有什么困难的。只有企图在粮食自由市场获得暴利的人，才会反对这些必要的手续和办法。
    反革命分子和用心不良的人，必然会想各种办法来反对破坏定量供应，他们一定会趁着部分人一时还不了解定量供应的好处而产生的紧张心理来造谣生事，所有工作人员和广大市民一定要揭穿这些破坏活动。广大群众会根据自己的亲身经验认识到定量供应的优越性，因而积极地保证这一办法的贯彻执行。
    实行定量供应是一件细致的工作，开始就应该认真地把它作好。分类分等要切合实际，主观草率就必然要受到群众的反对，达不到粮食供应制度化的要求。我们必须接受过去在粮食供应上的教训，深入地了解情况，在已有经验的基础上，使这次粮食定量供应工作做得更好。
