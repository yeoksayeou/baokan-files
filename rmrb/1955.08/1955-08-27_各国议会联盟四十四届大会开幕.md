Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, August 25th: The 44th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference opened on August 25th in the Finnish Parliament's meeting hall. Parliamentary delegations from forty-three countries are participating in the conference.

Lord Stansgate, President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, declared the conference open.

Finnish President Paasikivi then delivered a welcoming speech.

He said that the Inter-Parliamentary Union occupies a special position among organizations dedicated to international cooperation. The agenda of the 44th conference, which is now meeting here, includes important international issues, particularly the item on peaceful coexistence among nations. I am convinced that the discussions on these issues to be held here will be echoed throughout the world.

In his speech, Lord Stansgate, speaking about the issue of accepting new members into the Inter-Parliamentary Union, said that he believed the Executive Committee of the Council was wrong to delay the acceptance of new members. Lord Stansgate pointed out that the Inter-Parliamentary Union must not be turned into an institution for diplomatic negotiations between countries, and in this regard, he criticized attempts to negotiate with strength as backing. Finally, Lord Stansgate urged members of the Inter-Parliamentary Union to help build peace on the basis of friendship among nations.

On the motion of Lord Stansgate, Lennart Heljas, Chairman of the Finnish Parliamentary Group, was elected as the Chairman of the conference.

In his speech, Heljas pointed out that this conference is being held at a time when hope for maintaining peace has risen among the people of the world. He said that we hope that the meetings of our Union will achieve constructive results, thereby promoting the consolidation of peace and goodwill among nations.

After his speech, a general discussion was held on the report submitted to the 44th conference by the Secretary-General of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in accordance with Article 8 of the Rules of Procedure.

A large part of the report reviewed the general international situation. The report pointed out that the international situation, which has been tense for a long time due to contradictions between East and West, has recently begun to undergo significant changes. Both sides have taken steps that have helped to change the uneasy atmosphere in which people of all countries have lived in recent years. Meetings between politicians have become more frequent. The report pointed out that there has been slow but real progress in more harmoniously adjusting international relations.

The part of the report on China briefly described the characteristics of the political institutions of New China and pointed out that China advocates peaceful coexistence, which expresses the innermost desire of the young countries of the Asian continent, because the desire for peace is the most authentic indicator of their policies. The report quoted the part of the Sino-Indian joint statement that elaborated the Five Principles.

The part of the report on the relations between Western countries and Asian countries pointed out that the political structure of Southeast Asia has undergone profound changes since World War II. This evolution has presented Western countries with numerous problems. It is not always easy for them to agree to a policy aimed at establishing relations with some of the countries in their midst in regions where they once played a dominant role. The report outlined the process of establishing the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The report continued, but some countries believe that policies aimed primarily at establishing or expanding military blocs are dangerous. On this point, the report presented the report author's views on both the positive and negative aspects of neutrality; the report specifically stated that it is recognized that the existence of neutral countries can now have positive significance.

At the morning session, representatives from Sudan, the Federal Republic of Germany, Turkey, Japan, Ireland, India, Yugoslavia, and other countries spoke. All the speakers expressed satisfaction with the recent reconciliation and spoke of the need to make new efforts to further ease tensions and create conditions for peaceful coexistence among nations.

At the evening session on the 25th, the Council of the Union's proposed amendments to Articles 3, 10, and 17 of the Union's Statute were discussed and adopted.

Afterwards, the discussion of the Secretary-General of the Union's report continued. Representatives from Hungary, Bulgaria, Thailand, Brazil, and the Netherlands spoke during the discussion. After the meeting, the Finnish delegation held a reception in the Finnish Parliament Building to entertain the delegates from various countries attending the conference.

　　各国议会联盟四十四届大会开幕
    新华社二十六日讯　据塔斯社赫尔辛基二十五日讯：各国议会联盟第四十四届大会二十五日在芬兰议会会议厅开幕。参加大会的有四十三个国家的议会代表团。
    各国议会联盟主席斯坦斯盖特勋爵宣布开会。
    接着芬兰总统巴锡基维致欢迎词。
    他说，各国议会联盟在致力于国际合作的组织中占有特殊地位。现在在这里开会的第四十四届大会议程上包括有重要的国际问题，特别是关于各国人民和平共处的项目。我深信，将在这里进行的对这些问题的讨论将会获得全世界的响应。
    斯坦斯盖特勋爵在讲话中谈到接受新会员加入各国议会联盟的问题时说，他认为理事会执行委员会拖延接受新会员的做法是错误的。斯坦斯盖特勋爵指出，决不能使各国议会联盟变成一个国家之间进行外交谈判的机构，在这方面他批评了想以实力为后盾进行谈判的企图。最后，斯坦斯盖特勋爵敦促各国议会联盟的成员帮助在各国人民间友爱的基础上建立和平。
    根据斯坦斯盖特勋爵的动议，芬兰议会议员团主席伦纳特·希尔加斯被选为本届大会的主席。
    希尔加斯在演说中指出，这次大会是在全世界人民当中已经兴起了维护和平的希望的时候举行的。他说我们希望我们联盟的会议将获得建设性的结果，从而促进和平的巩固和各国之间的善意。
    在他演说之后，接着对各国议会联盟秘书长依照会议条例第八条向第四十四届大会提出的报告进行一般讨论。
    报告的一大部分是回顾总的国际局势。报告指出，长时期来由于东西方之间的矛盾因而一直是很紧张的国际局势最近已经开始有显著的改变。双方都采取了有助于改变最近几年来各国人民所处的不安的气氛的步骤。政治家们的会晤已经比较频繁。报告指出，在更协调地调整国际关系方面已经有了缓慢然而真正的进展。
    报告中关于中国的一部分简单地叙述了新中国的政治机构的特征，并且指出，中国主张和平共处，表现了亚洲大陆的年青国家的内心深处的愿望，因为对和平的渴望是它们的政策的最真实的指标。报告引用了中—印联合声明中阐述五项原则的那一部分。
    报告中关于西方国家和亚洲国家的关系的那一部分指出，东南亚的政治结构在第二次世界大战之后已经起了深刻的变化。这种演变使西方国家面临众多的问题。要它们同意一个目的在于同它们中间的某些国家在它们曾经一度起过统治作用的地区的国家建立关系的政策，并不是始终容易办到的事情。报告就此概述了建立东南亚条约组织的经过。
    报告继续说，但是某些国家认为，主要目的在于建立或者扩大军事集团的政策是一种危险的政策。关于这一点，报告提出了报告作者对中立的积极和消极两个方面的见解；报告特别说，大家承认中立国的存在现在可以有积极的意义。
    在上午的会议上发言的有苏丹、德意志联邦共和国、土耳其、日本、爱尔兰、印度、南斯拉夫等国家的代表。所有的发言者都满意地指出最近形成的和解并且都谈到必需作新的努力以便进一步缓和紧张局势和为各国间的和平共处创造条件。
    在二十五日晚间的会议上，讨论并且通过了联盟理事会对联盟章程第三、第十和第十七条提出的修正案。
    之后，继续讨论联盟秘书长的报告。讨论时发言的有匈牙利、保加利亚、泰国、巴西和荷兰的代表。会后芬兰代表团在芬兰议会大厦举行招待会，招待参加大会的各国代表们。
