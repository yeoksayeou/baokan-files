Huailai Utilizes Barren Beaches to Develop Fruit Tree Production

Huailai County, Hebei Province, has over a hundred villages that are rich in various fruits such as apples and grapes. The county has more than 30,000 mu of fruit tree orchards, and it is estimated that this year's total fruit production will exceed 16 million jin. To help farmers eliminate fruit tree pests, the state supplied farmers with more than 24,400 jin of various pesticides this year, which basically eliminated pests such as the pear slug caterpillar and tent caterpillar, ensuring the vigorous growth of fruit trees. In order to fully utilize mountainous areas, barren beaches, and poor land to develop fruit tree production, Huailai County plans to plant a large number of fruit trees such as apples and pears around the Guanting Reservoir. The state-owned fruit tree demonstration farm is currently conducting surveying and design work on a large sandy beach of approximately 50,000 mu on the south bank of the reservoir. (Ge Junmin)

    怀来利用荒滩发展果树生产
    河北省怀来县有一百多个村庄盛产苹果、葡萄等各种水果，全县有三万多亩果树林，估计今年可生产各种水果共一千六百万斤以上。为了帮助农民消灭果树虫害，国家今年供应农民各种农药二万四千四百多斤，基本上全部消灭了梨星毛虫、天幕毛虫等害虫，保证了果树生长的繁茂。怀来县为了充分利用山地、荒滩和薄地发展果树生产，计划在官厅水库四周大量种植苹果、梨等果树，国营果树示范场现正在水库南岸约有五万亩的大沙滩上进行勘测设计。（葛浚民）
