Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 5th: The third session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union continued in Moscow on the 5th. The conference began discussing the report made by Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, on the results of the Geneva Four-Power Summit.

    The first to speak at the meeting was Puzanov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation and Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

    Puzanov said that we Soviets believe that fear and hostility should not rule the world. Peaceful cooperation and trust, this is the foundation upon which mutual relations between the peoples of all countries should be built. The spirit of cooperation, mutual understanding, and trust that permeated the Geneva conference is of great significance. Since the four countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France were able to unite to fight fascism together in the Second World War, the proposition of peaceful coexistence among all countries should now triumph. We welcome the words of US President Eisenhower: The American people want to be friends with the Soviet people.

    Puzanov concluded by saying that the Soviet people and the deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union are very satisfied with the results of the work of our government delegation at the Geneva conference. He suggested that the conference fully approve the activities of the Soviet government delegation and the report it submitted to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for review. This proposal was met with prolonged applause from the audience.

    Also speaking at the morning meeting were Soviet Supreme Soviet deputies Ivashchenko, Mzhavanadze, Rashidov, and Avshimovich, among others.

    The meeting is continuing.

    苏联最高苏维埃会议讨论布尔加宁报告
    新华社五日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃第三次会议五日继续在莫斯科举行。会议开始讨论苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁做的关于日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的结果的报告。
    在会议上首先发言的是俄罗斯联邦部长会议主席、苏联最高苏维埃代表普扎诺夫。
    普扎诺夫说，我们苏联人认为，不应该让恐惧和敌意统治世界。和平合作和信任，这是建立各国人民间的互相关系所应该有的基础。日内瓦会议上充满了合作、互相谅解和信任的精神，这有着重大的意义。既然在第二次世界大战中，英、美、苏、法四国能够团结起来对法西斯主义进行共同的斗争，那末，现在各国和平共处的主张也就应当获得胜利。我们欢迎美国总统艾森豪威尔的这句话：美国人民希望作为苏联人民的朋友。
    普扎诺夫最后说，苏联人民和苏联最高苏维埃的代表们对我们政府代表团在日内瓦会议上的工作结果感到非常满意。他建议会议完全赞同苏联政府代表团的活动和它提交苏联最高苏维埃审查的报告。这项建议获得了全场经久不息的掌声。
    在上午会议上发言的还有苏联最高苏维埃代表伊瓦希钦科、姆扎瓦纳泽、拉希多夫和阿夫希摩维奇等人。
    会议在继续进行中。
