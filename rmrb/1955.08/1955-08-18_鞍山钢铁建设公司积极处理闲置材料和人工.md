Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company Actively Handles Idle Materials and Labor

    The Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company is actively handling materials and labor made idle by the reduction of civil construction.

    Anshan Iron and Steel has reduced its civil construction area by more than 100,000 square meters this year. In addition, nearly 100,000 square meters of three- and four-story buildings have been converted into single-story buildings, or unnecessary decorations and facilities have been reduced. After the reduction plan was determined, the relevant departments established a special organization to inventory the materials in stock and researched methods such as reconstruction and substitution, external sales, and departmental balancing to handle the idle materials. Currently, thousands of sets of prefabricated doors and windows that were idle have been reconstructed and used in single-story buildings or warehouses. Common building materials such as red bricks, rubble, sand, and white lime have been completely or partially transferred to other projects. After a batch of wooden materials was reconstructed, it was used in single-story buildings. Its strength fully meets the requirements, so only a small portion of new wood needs to be purchased for more than 47,000 square meters of single-story building projects. The idle construction machinery, steel rails, 20 mobile housing frames for temporary projects, and old wires have also been transferred to relevant departments and sold to other departments in need. For some prefabricated components and steel that cannot be processed, a material catalog has also been prepared to facilitate adjustment on a larger scale. More than 2,000 civil construction workers who were idled due to the reduction of civil construction and the delay of the construction period have also been promptly transferred to projects with heavier workloads.

    鞍山钢铁建设公司积极处理闲置材料和人工
    鞍山钢铁建设公司积极处理民用建筑削减后闲置的材料和人工。
    鞍钢今年削减了十万多平方公尺的民用建筑面积，另外还有近十万平方公尺的三、四层楼房改为平房或减少了不必要的装饰和设施。这个削减计划确定后，有关部门成立了专门组织，清点了库存物资，并研究出改造代用、向外推销、各部门平衡等办法来处理闲置的材料。现在，闲置的几千付预制门窗都经改造后用到平房或仓库上去。红砖、块石、砂子、白灰等通用性的建筑材料已全部或部分调到其他工程上去。一批木质材料经改造后用到平房上去，它的强度完全合乎需要，因而有四万七千多平方公尺的平房工程，只要另买很少部分新木料就够了。闲置的施工机械和钢轨以及临时工程用的二十个活动房架和旧电线，也都分别移交有关部门和卖给其他需用的部门。有些不能处理的预制构件、钢材等，也开具了材料目录，以便在较大范围内进行调剂。因民用建筑削减和工期推迟而窝工的两千多名土木建筑工人，也都及时调到工作较忙的工程中去。（新华社）
