    The heroic struggle of Colombian farmers to defend their right to live and to oppose the conversion of their land into foreign military bases has been ongoing since the end of last year. The farmer uprising in the coffee-producing center of Tolima Province has been particularly acute. Local farmers have been engaged in a protracted struggle against the government, opposing its use of their land for the construction of airports, firing ranges, barracks, and other military installations. To suppress the uprising, the Colombian government declared the eastern part of Tolima Province, with a population of approximately 100,000, a "military operations zone," and used air force, tanks, and large numbers of troops. Hundreds of farmers were massacred, thousands of women and children were left homeless and starving, and entire villages were looted. However, all these terror measures have not subdued the Colombian farmers, who are resolutely resisting the savage attacks of the government troops.
    The Colombian government's large-scale expulsion of farmers from their land and the brutal military offensive against the uprising farmers is no accident.
    Like other Latin American countries, Colombia is an important source of maximum profit for American monopoly capitalists. Colombia not only possesses cheap labor but also important mineral resources: for example, it ranks third in the capitalist world in platinum production and third in Latin America in oil production, in addition to coal, iron, aluminum, etc. Currently, American capital accounts for four-fifths of total foreign investment in Colombia; American capital owns 71 percent of Colombia's oil extraction industry. Colombia's foreign trade is mainly controlled by American monopoly organizations. Colombia exports raw materials and imports surplus consumer goods from the American market. American monopoly capitalists use this to lower the prices of Colombian exports as much as possible while forcing Colombia to buy American goods at high prices, intensifying the exploitation of the Colombian people. The United Fruit Company, known as the "Green Devil," controls the prices of Colombia's major agricultural exports. It owns large merchant ships, railways, and highway networks. It has even established its own prisons and police and issued banknotes. It is a paramount "kingdom" within Colombia. The farmers under its control are subjected to slave-like treatment.
    To intensify its enslavement of Colombia, the United States has strengthened its control over the country. In addition to controlling Colombia's military bases, ports, and transportation, the United States has also entered into a so-called "military mutual assistance agreement" with Colombia. American newspapers have reported that some large American monopoly organizations are planning to move some American military industries to Latin American countries in order to further extract profits.
    Under the Colombian government's foreign policy that violates national interests and the cruel exploitation by American monopoly capital, the lives of the Colombian people are deteriorating, and the struggle against American monopoly capital's shackles, to ensure national independence, and to defend peace and democracy is developing. Oil and agricultural workers have repeatedly gone on strike. The Colombian General Confederation of Labor organizes and leads the national workers' struggle. In 1948, during the American-controlled Pan-American Conference held in Bogotá, the Colombian capital, the progressive figure Gaitán was assassinated by reactionaries. The Colombian people held an armed uprising and once controlled several cities, demonstrating the strength of the Colombian people's patriotic forces. In the countryside, impoverished farmers, unable to bear oppression and exploitation, have also organized guerrilla forces to fight against the government troops sent to oppress them. Although the Colombian government frequently sends large numbers of troops and police forces to attack the guerrillas, it cannot prevent the development of the guerrilla forces.
    The increasingly rising struggle of the Colombian and other Latin American peoples to defend national independence and the right to live has made American monopoly capital deeply uneasy. As early as 1952, there was news that the US State Department, the Pentagon, and the "National Psychological Strategy Board" had drafted a "special measures" plan to prevent the "terrible spread of anti-American and anti-militarist sentiment" in Latin American countries. Recently, there was another piece of news that the United States intends to intensify the suppression of the activities of "nationalists and leftists" in Latin America. The US Congress has allocated $300,000 for the US State Department, the Justice Department, and the FBI to convene a conference of American national police chiefs this summer to "coordinate police activities between the United States and Latin American countries." One of the initiators of this conference, Russell Snook, the superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, openly stated that Americans should create a situation where any American police chief can issue orders to Latin American police chiefs by telephone at any time. It is not difficult to understand that the Colombian government's brutal military offensive against the uprising farmers has an international background. However, airplanes, tanks, and artillery cannot subdue the heroic uprising farmers of Colombia. According to the Colombian government, the government troops suffered heavy losses due to the farmers' stubborn resistance. The Colombian farmers' struggle against the government's brutal military offensive is supported by the National Liberation Democratic Front formed by various Colombian parties. Committees have been established in many parts of the country to fight for the release of imprisoned farmers and to stop acts of terror. The Latin American Labor Alliance has also issued a statement calling on working people around the world to protest the Colombian government's criminal actions against the uprising farmers. There is no doubt that the just struggle of the Colombian uprising farmers has also received the deep sympathy and support of the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world.

    哥伦比亚农民的起义
    钦本立
    自去年年底以来，哥伦比亚农民为捍卫自己生活权利和反对把他们的土地变为外国军事基地而进行的英勇斗争，一直在继续进行中。咖啡主要出产中心托里马省地区的农民起义具有特别尖锐的性质。当地农民为反对政府把他们的土地用来建筑飞机场、打靶场、兵营和其他军事建筑同政府军队进行了持久的斗争。为了镇压起义农民，哥伦比亚政府把约有十万居民的托里马省东部地区宣布为“军事行动区”，并且使用了空军、坦克和庞大的部队，数以百计的农民被残杀，数千名妇女和儿童无家可归并陷于饥饿的绝境，整个的村庄遭到洗劫。但是，所有这些恐怖措施并没有使哥伦比亚起义农民屈服，他们坚决地抵抗政府军队的野蛮的进攻。
    哥伦比亚政府这样大规模地驱逐农民离开他们的土地，并残暴地对起义农民进行军事进攻，不是偶然的。
    哥伦比亚同其他的拉丁美洲国家一样，是美国垄断资本家榨取最大限度利润的重要来源地之一。哥伦比亚不但拥有廉价的劳动力，还拥有不少重要的矿产资源：例如铂占资本主义世界第三位，石油居拉丁美洲第三位，此外还拥有煤、铁、铝等。现在，美国资本在哥伦比亚的外国投资总额中占到五分之四；哥伦比亚石油开采业中百分之七十一为美国资本所有。哥伦比亚的对外贸易主要受美国垄断组织所控制。哥伦比亚出口的是原料，进口的却是美国市场过剩的消费品。美国垄断资本家利用这一点，尽量降低哥伦比亚输出的货物的价格，同时又强迫哥伦比亚以高价购买美国的商品，加强对哥伦比亚人民的掠夺。被称为“绿色魔鬼”的美国联合水果公司，就操纵着哥伦比亚主要出口农产品的价格。它拥有大商船、铁道和公路网。它曾自己设立监狱和警察，并发行纸币。它是哥伦比亚境内的太上“王国”。在它控制下的农民受着奴隶般的待遇。
    为了加紧对哥伦比亚的奴役，美国加强了它对哥伦比亚的控制。美国除了控制着哥伦比亚的军事基地、港口、交通外，还同哥伦比亚订有所谓“军事互助协定”。美国报刊曾经传出消息，美国某些大垄断组织还在策划把一部分美国军事工业迁移到拉丁美洲各国，以便进一步榨取利润。
    在哥伦比亚政府执行违反民族利益的对外政策和美国垄断资本残酷掠夺下，哥伦比亚人民的生活日益恶化，反对美国垄断资本束缚、保障民族独立、保卫和平和民主的斗争日益发展。石油工人和农业工人曾多次地罢工。哥伦比亚总工会组织和领导着全国工人进行斗争。一九四八年，由美国控制的泛美会议在哥伦比亚首都波哥大召开的期间，哥伦比亚进步势力代表盖丹遭反动派暗杀，哥伦比亚人民曾举行了武装大暴动，并曾一度控制了若干城市，表现了哥伦比亚人民爱国力量的强大。在乡村，贫苦农民不堪压迫和剥削，也纷纷组织起游击队同政府派来压迫他们的军队作战。哥伦比亚政府虽然经常派大批的军队和警察部队去进攻游击队，但并不能阻碍游击队力量的发展。
    哥伦比亚和其他拉丁美洲国家人民日益高涨的为保卫民族独立和生活权利而进行的斗争，使美国垄断资本深为不安，因此早在一九五二年时就有消息说：美国国务院、五角大楼和“全国心理战略局”已经拟订了一项“特别措施”计划，以防止拉丁美洲国家中日益增长的“反美与反军国主义情绪的可怕的蔓延”。最近又有一个消息说：美国打算加紧压制拉丁美洲的“民族主义分子和左翼分子”活动，美国国会拨出三十万美元，由美国国务院、司法部和联邦调查局在今年夏季召集一次美洲国家警察局长会议，“调配美国和拉丁美洲国家的警察活动”。这次会议的发起人之一、新泽西州州警察局长拉塞尔·斯诺克公然说，美国人应该造成这样一种局面：美国的任何警察局长都能随时用电话向拉丁美洲的警察局长发布命令。不难理解，哥伦比亚政府这次对起义农民采取残暴的军事进攻，是有它的国际背景的。但是，飞机、坦克、大炮也不能使哥伦比亚英勇的起义农民屈服。据哥伦比亚政府方面承认，由于农民的顽强抵抗，政府军队遭到很大的损失。哥伦比亚起义农民反对政府残暴的军事进攻的斗争，得到哥伦比亚各党派结成的民族解放民主战线的支持。国内许多地区成立了委员会，为争取释放被囚的农民、制止恐怖行动而斗争。拉丁美洲劳工联盟也曾发出声明，号召全世界劳动人民抗议哥伦比亚政府对起义农民的这种罪恶行动。毫无疑问，哥伦比亚起义农民的正义斗争也得到中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的深切的同情和支持。
