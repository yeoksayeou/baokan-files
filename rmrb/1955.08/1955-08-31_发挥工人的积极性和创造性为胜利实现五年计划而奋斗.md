The All-China Federation of Trade Unions held its Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Executive Committee, discussed issues such as strengthening trade union construction, strengthening the ties between trade unions and the masses, and promoting labor emulation to a new high, and also issued the "Letter to All Employees Across the Country from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to Ensure the Completion and Over-fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy." This meeting was timely and important. It put forward an extremely important task to the vast number of employees and trade unions at all levels across the country, that is, to further give play to the working class's high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, and unremittingly strive for the realization of the Five-Year Plan.

In the great cause of building socialism and realizing our country's First Five-Year Plan, giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the millions of working people, especially the working class, and continuously improving labor productivity and reducing costs, is of primary significance. According to the provisions of the Five-Year Plan, the labor productivity of state-owned industries should increase by an average of 10 percent each year, and the labor productivity of construction and installation in industrial capital construction units should increase by an average of 11 percent each year. Of the output value increased by state-owned industries in 1957 compared to 1952, more than two-thirds came from increased labor productivity. To achieve this task, it is obviously impossible without the hard work of the broad masses of workers. And the constant and effective method of improving labor productivity is to launch extensive labor emulation. In other words, to smoothly realize the Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to continuously push labor emulation to a new high.

Organizing labor emulation and giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses is inseparable from the implementation of the Party's principle of the mass line. The truth that relying on the masses is the only way to solve all kinds of difficulties on the road to advancement has been proven by the victories in various revolutionary historical periods in our country. However, to this day, some of our comrades still have bureaucratic work styles, are detached from the masses, and even harm the immediate interests of the masses. These comrades still have some wrong understandings in their thinking, and their mass viewpoint is still relatively weak.

The weak mass viewpoint is primarily reflected in the fact that the leading staff in some enterprises only unilaterally see the role played by top-down work methods in their actual work, while neglecting the power of the masses, and thus deviating from the principle of the mass line. They do not understand that building a socialist society, this extremely arduous undertaking, not only requires the top-down leadership of leading organs and leading staff at all levels, but must also obtain the direct support of the broad masses of people, especially workers and peasants, from the bottom up. Enterprise administrative leaders can of course issue orders, and large-scale industrial production must also have a management system sufficient to unify the will and actions of thousands of people. However, if they are not good at combining the strict top-down management system with the enthusiasm of the masses like a spring tide from the bottom up, and are not good at combining economic work with political work, even if the system is very complete, it cannot be well implemented, or even completely unworkable.

The weak mass viewpoint of enterprise leaders is also reflected in only paying attention to putting forward this and that requirement to the masses, while not paying attention or not paying much attention to the requirements put forward by the masses to the leadership. How do enterprise leaders treat the demands of the masses? How to combine the requirements of the Party and the state with the requirements of the masses? In this regard, our work has been done very insufficiently. Workers in many places demand to learn technology, but the leadership does not pay attention to it and does not solve it, so workers have to spend high fees to study in private technical training classes. There are also some factories and mines where the labor conditions are unsafe, and workers suggest making some basic improvements, but the leadership does not pay attention to it and does not solve it until accidents occur, and then they deal with it. Some factories and mines even put forward to the masses at production meetings: only self-criticism of one's own mistakes is allowed, criticism of the leadership's shortcomings is not allowed, and emphasis on objective reasons is not allowed. Many similar phenomena can be cited. Under such circumstances, how can the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses be brought into play!

In order to change this situation and give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses in all aspects to ensure the smooth realization of our country's First Five-Year Plan, the following tasks must be done well:

First, we must further develop labor emulation and continuously push labor emulation to a new high. In the past few years, labor emulation has been universally carried out throughout the country, and some experience has been accumulated and many achievements have been made. Taking 1954 as an example, employees put forward more than 840,000 rationalization proposals, many factories and mines have universally implemented the mass production meeting system, more than 600 enterprises and institutions across the country have signed collective contracts, and inter-factory competitions in some areas have also made new developments. However, there are still many shortcomings in the current labor emulation, the main problem being that formalism is quite common. In addition, there is a lack of necessary material rewards, the work of rationalization proposals has also been somewhat relaxed recently, and the assistance to backward workers and backward units is very insufficient. Therefore, we must continue to strengthen political and ideological work in the competition, conscientiously organize workers to learn technology, improve technology, and master new technologies, and strengthen specific assistance to backward workers, and implement the principle of material rewards. In the competition, one issue that should be paid special attention to is mobilizing the advanced to lead the backward and helping backward workers and backward units catch up with the advanced. This is a basic issue of whether labor emulation can become a widespread mass movement. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in "On the Party," "Only when the masses in the intermediate and backward states become conscious, become enthusiastic, and rise up to act can there be a mass movement."

Second, under the leadership of the enterprise Party committee, give play to the supervisory role of the trade union organization over the enterprise's work. Now, some comrades, especially administrative leading comrades, are still not very willing to mention the supervision of enterprise work by trade union organizations. They believe that the supervision of enterprise work by trade union organizations is only needed in capitalist enterprises, and is not needed or not necessarily needed in socialist enterprises. This is a wrong understanding. The main reason for this understanding is the confusion between the supervision of trade unions in socialist enterprises and the supervision in capitalist enterprises. The supervision of trade unions in capitalist enterprises is a form of class struggle and has the nature of class struggle. The supervision of trade unions in socialist enterprises is a form of criticism and self-criticism within the working class and has the nature of comradeship assistance. The trade union is a mass organization of the working class, and the supervision of enterprise work by the trade union is actually the supervision of the working masses. With this supervision, the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses in participating in enterprise production management can be further brought into play, the enterprise leaders and the masses can be closely combined, and the shortcomings in enterprise work can be revealed and overcome in a timely manner under the gaze of the millions of eyes of the broad masses. Therefore, enterprise leaders should not reject but should welcome this supervision. Of course, to enable trade union supervision to play a role, the trade union organization itself must closely connect with the masses, fully promote democracy, and put all the activities of the trade union under the supervision of the masses. At the same time, the enterprise Party organization must also strengthen its leadership over this work so that the supervision of the trade union masses becomes an important reliance of the Party's supervision.

Third, enthusiastically care for the lives of the masses and continuously and practically improve the labor conditions and living conditions of the workers in accordance with the national plan. For the long-term interests of the people of the whole country and for the construction of socialism, the people of the whole country must carry forward the spirit of hard struggle and endure some temporary difficulties. This is a truth that the vast majority of workers understand. However, if the enterprise leaders therefore do not care about the lives of the workers, and do not actively solve some labor protection issues and workers' living problems that should be solved and can be solved, that is a serious mistake. We have always believed that raising the level of awareness of the working masses is an important source of stimulating the workers' labor enthusiasm; however, it is not enough to rely solely on political education to make the labor enthusiasm of the masses lasting, and we must also adhere to the principle of material encouragement, especially to implement the correct wage policy. Because the main source or the only source of workers' livelihood is wages, whether wages are reasonable or not directly affects the lives of workers and their families. Such a major issue cannot be ignored.

The Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has discussed the above issues and made considerable work arrangements in the trade union organizations, which is very necessary; the Party committees at all levels must specifically lead and help the trade unions at all levels to implement them well. To this end, the Party committees at all levels should strengthen their leadership over the trade unions, regularly discuss and inspect the work of the trade unions, supervise the trade unions to follow the Party's policies and guidelines to carry out all activities, help the trade unions carry out the training of cadres and activists, appropriately adjust and equip the main leading cadres of the trade unions through mass elections, and instruct all Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members to actively participate in various activities of the trade union organizations and play a backbone role. Under the leadership and help of the Party committees at all levels, as long as the trade union organizations at all levels conscientiously overcome the work style of being detached from the masses and giving compulsory orders, and improve the democratic life of the trade union organizations, they will surely be able to further give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers and ensure the victorious realization of our country's First Five-Year Plan.

### 发挥工人的积极性和创造性为胜利实现五年计划而奋斗

　　发挥工人的积极性和创造性为胜利实现五年计划而奋斗
    中华全国总工会举行了第七届执行委员会第三次全体会议，讨论了加强工会建设、密切工会与群众的联系和把劳动竞赛推向新的高涨等问题，同时发表了“中华全国总工会为保证完成和超额完成发展国民经济的第一个五年计划告全国职工书”。这个会议是适时的和重要的，它向全国广大职工和各级工会提出了一个极其重要的任务，这就是进一步发挥工人阶级高度的积极性和创造性，坚持不懈地为实现五年计划而奋斗。
    在建设社会主义和实现我国第一个五年计划的伟大事业中，发挥千百万劳动群众首先是工人群众的积极性和创造性，不断地提高劳动生产率和降低成本，具有首要的意义。根据五年计划的规定，国营工业的劳动生产率平均每年要提高百分之十，工业基本建设单位建筑安装的劳动生产率平均每年要提高百分之十一。国营工业一九五七年比一九五二年增加的产值中，有三分之二以上是从提高劳动生产率而来的。为了实现这个任务，如果没有广大工人群众的努力奋斗，显然是不可能的。而提高劳动生产率的经常的有效方法，就是展开广泛的劳动竞赛。也就是说，为了顺利地实现五年计划，就必须不断地把劳动竞赛推向新的高涨。
    组织劳动竞赛，发挥工人群众的积极性和创造 性，是和贯彻党的群众路线的原则分不开的。只有依靠群众才能解决前进道路上的各种困难，这个真理已为我国各个革命历史时期的胜利所证明。但是，直到今天，在我们的同志中间，还有些人存在着官僚主义作风，脱离群众，甚至损害群众切身的利益。这些同志在思想上还有一些错误的认识，他们的群众观点还比较薄弱。
    群众观点薄弱，首先表现在某些企业的领导工作人员在实际工作中只片面地看到自上而下的工作方式所产生的作用，而忽视了群众的力量，因而也就脱离了群众路线的原则。他们不了解，建立社会主义社会这个极端艰巨的事业，不仅要依靠各级领导机关和领导工作人员由上而下的领导，还必须取得广大人民群众首先是工人和农民从下而上的直接支持。企业行政领导者当然可以发号施令，大工业生产也必须有足以统一千万人的意志和行动的管理制度。但是如果不善于把自上而下的严格的管理制度和自下而上的群众春潮般的积极性结合起来，不善于把经济工作和政治工作结合起来，即使制度十分完善，也是不能很好实行的，甚至是完全行不通的。
    企业领导者群众观点薄弱还表现在只注意向群众提出这样和那样的要求，而不注意或不很注意群众向领导上提出的要求。企业领导者如何对待群众的要求呢？如何把党和国家的要求同群众的要求结合起来呢？在这方面，我们的工作是作得十分不够的。不少地方的工人要求学习技术，领导上不注意、不解决，工人只好花很高的酬金到私立的技术补习班去学习。也有一些厂矿的劳动条件不安全，工人建议做一些起码的改善，领导上也不注意，不解决，直到事故发生，这才加以处理。有的厂矿甚至在生产会议上向群众提出：只准检讨自己的错误，不准批评领导的缺点，不准强调客观原因。诸如此类的现象，还可以举出很多。在这种情况下，如何能发挥群众的积极性和创造性呢！
    为了改变这种状况，并从各方面发挥群众的积极性和创造性以保证我国第一个五年计划的顺利实现，就必须做好以下几项工作：
    第一，要进一步开展劳动竞赛，不断地把劳动竞赛推向新的高涨。几年来，劳动竞赛已在全国普遍开展起来，并且已经积累了一些经验，取得了不少的成绩。以一九五四年为例，职工提出的合理化建议达八十四万多件，许多厂矿已普遍推行了群众生产会议制度，全国六百多个企业单位签订了集体合同，若干地区的厂际竞赛也有新的发展。但是，目前劳动竞赛还存在不少缺点，主要的问题是形式主义相当普遍。此外还缺乏必要的物质奖励，对合理化建议工作最近也有些放松，对落后工人和落后单位的帮助十分不够。因此，我们必须继续加强竞赛中的政治思想工作，认真组织工人群众学习技术、改进技术和掌握新的技术，并加强对落后工人的具体帮助，贯彻物质奖励的原则。在竞赛中，特别应该注意的一个问题是发动先进带动落后，帮助落后的工人和落后的单位赶上先进的。这是劳动竞赛能否成为一个广泛的群众运动的基本问题。正如刘少奇同志在“论党”中所说的：“只有中间状态与落后状态的群众有了觉悟，有了热情，起来行动的时候，才能有群众运动”。
    第二，要在企业党委的领导下，发挥工会组织对企业工作的监督作用。现在，有些同志特别是行政领导同志还不大愿意提到工会组织对于企业工作的监督。他们以为，工会组织对企业工作的监督，只有在资本主义企业里才需要，而在社会主义企业里则是不需要或不一定需要的。这是一种错误的认识。产生这种认识的主要原因是把工会在社会主义企业中的监督和在资本主义企业中的监督混为一谈。工会在资本主义企业中的监督是阶级斗争的一种形式，具有阶级斗争的性质。而工会在社会主义企业中的监督则是工人阶级内部的批评与自我批评的一种形式，具有同志帮助的性质。工会是工人阶级的群众组织，工会对企业工作的监督实际上是工人群众的监督，有了这种监督，就能进一步发挥工人群众参加企业生产管理的积极性和创造性，就可以使企业领导者和群众密切结合，企业工作中的缺点也能在广大群众的千万只眼睛的注视下及时揭发出来，加以克服。因此，企业的领导者不应该拒绝而应该欢迎这种监督。当然，要使工会监督能够发挥作用，工会组织本身就必须要密切联系群众，充分发扬民主，把工会的一切活动放在群众的监督之下。同时，企业党组织也必须加强领导这项工作，使工会群众的监督成为党的监督的一个重要依靠。
    第三，要热情地关怀群众生活，根据国家计划不断地切实地改善工人的劳动条件和生活条件。为了全国人民的长远利益，为了建设社会主义，全国人民要发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，忍受暂时的某些困难。这是绝大多数的工人群众都懂得的道理。可是，如果企业领导工作人员因此就不关心工人生活，对应该解决也可能解决的某些劳动保护问题、工人生活问题也不积极解决，那就是严重的错误。我们始终认为，提高工人群众的觉悟程度，是激发工人劳动热情的重要源泉；可是单单指靠政治教育，是不能使群众的劳动热情持久的，还必须坚持贯彻物质鼓励原则，特别是要贯彻正确的工资政策。因为工人生活的主要来源或唯一来源是工资，工资合理与否，直接影响着工人及其家庭的生活。对于这样一个重大问题，是不能漠不关心的。
    全国总工会七届三次执委会议对以上问题都做了讨论并在工会组织中做了相当的工作布置，这是非常必要的；各级党委必须具体领导和帮助各级工会使它们很好地贯彻实行。为此，各级党委应该加强对工会的领导，定期讨论和检查工会工作，监督工会遵循党的方针政策去进行一切活动，帮助工会进行干部积极分子培养训练工作，通过群众选举适当地调整和配备工会的主要领导干部，责成所有共产党员、青年团员都积极参加工会组织的各种活动并起骨干作用。在各级党委的领导和帮助下，只要各级工会组织认真地克服脱离群众和强迫命令的作风，健全工会组织的民主生活，就一定能够进一步发挥广大工人群众的积极性和创造性，保证我国第一个五年计划的胜利实现。
