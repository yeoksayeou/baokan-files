Visiting Fadil Paçrami, Head of the Albanian Cultural Delegation
By our reporters Quan Bi and Su Xin

　　One afternoon after a long spell of rain, we visited Comrade Fadil Paçrami, head of the Albanian Cultural Delegation, who had recently arrived in Beijing.

　　With his tall stature and robust build, it was immediately clear that Comrade Paçrami was a man of great energy. Although it was our first meeting, the people of China and Albania are not strangers to each other, and we felt immediately comfortable and began to chat freely.

　　The conversation naturally began with Albanian culture and art. He first introduced us to the way Albanian literature and art serve the cause of peace and socialism, and the achievements of Albanian cultural construction. He said that the Albanian Labor Party and the government of the People's Republic of Albania pursue policies in all aspects for peace and socialism. This is also clearly reflected in literature and art. Almost all new literary and artistic works revolve around this theme, with the aim of safeguarding the cause of world peace and inspiring the Albanian people to work harder for a bright socialist future. He cited the works of some writers, such as: "Suspicious Friends" by Miço Kallamata, which exposes the conspiracies of American and British imperialists in Tirana; "Flying Doves," an epic poem by Dhimitër Shuteriqi; "Unforgettable Wounds," a play by Besim Levonja; the short ballets "Friendship of Nations" and "Banner of Peace"; U. Haderi's sculpture "Girl and Dove," and so on. In the past three years, several new novels have appeared in Albania. "Liberators," a novel by Dh. Shuteriqi, writes about the history of the Albanian Labor Party's growth and its struggle for the happiness of the people; "They Are Not Isolated" by Sterjo Spasse and "The Road to Fushë-Krujë" by Kim Mehmeti reflect the Albanian peasants' resistance to feudal rule before liberation, their struggle for land, and after liberation, their organization of agricultural production cooperatives and their struggle against the remaining class enemies in the countryside.

　　The achievements of Albanian literature and art have been achieved on the basis of the increasing prosperity of the entire cultural cause. Speaking of this, Comrade Paçrami picked up a booklet from the table next to him. As he flipped through it, he excitedly listed many figures: the number of schools and students nationwide has tripled compared with before the war; the number of higher education institutions has increased from zero to six; six new theaters and eleven museums have been built; more than 2,000 amateur art groups participated in literary and artistic competitions last year; on average, each person in the country can get two or three books published each year; the annual circulation of 37 newspapers and periodicals in the country reaches 16 million copies... These figures clearly demonstrate the rapid development of Albania's cultural undertakings after liberation.

　　Before liberation, the lives of the Albanian people were like the long and cold polar night. Foreign imperialists and the domestic reactionary ruling class sucked the blood of the people, leaving them without clothes or food. How could the people possibly have access to culture? At that time, Albania's culture and economy were the most backward in Europe.

　　However, when the Albanian people, under the influence of the great victory of the Soviet Union in defeating fascist Germany, gained liberation through heroic struggle more than ten years ago, everything in this ancient country on the Adriatic coast began to change. Enver Hoxha pointed out: "We need a culture that helps the people work and produce, and we must also make this culture a weapon in the hands of the working masses..." In recent years, Enver Hoxha's instructions have become a reality.

　　In the era of the people's government, more books have been published in the national language than in the past centuries; the number of people receiving higher education at home and abroad is more than in the past fifty years. People's art is also blooming everywhere like flowers in spring. The new culture has promoted the progress of Albania's socialist construction and changed the face of society.

　　"Of course, all of this is inseparable from the leadership and concern of the Party," Comrade Paçrami emphasized when pointing out the important role of the Albanian Labor Party in developing culture and art. He said that according to the instructions of Marxism-Leninism, socialism cannot be built without cultured cadres and civilized people. Therefore, the Albanian Labor Party pays great attention to the development of culture, education, and art, and tries to absorb the experience of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries in this regard. In April this year, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party held in Tirana specifically discussed the ideological and political work of the Party, and stipulated concrete measures to improve this work. The resolution of the plenary session also pointed out the need to further strengthen the Party's leadership over cultural and artistic work, and to improve the conditions for literary and artistic workers to create. Undoubtedly, the resolution of this plenary session will bring about a new upsurge in Albanian culture and art.

　　At this point, the topic turned to cultural exchanges between China and Albania and the friendly relations between the two peoples. Comrade Paçrami said that cultural exchanges between China and Albania have developed significantly in recent years, especially after the signing of the scientific and technological cooperation agreement and the cultural agreement last year, cultural exchanges have become closer. The two countries have held many exhibitions, exchanged students, and publishing institutions have published books to introduce each other's history, economy, and culture. In 1952, the China Youth Art Troupe visited Albania for performances. This time, the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe is the first Albanian art troupe to visit China.

　　Comrade Paçrami told us that the Albanian people have deep feelings for the Chinese people, "They are eager to understand the achievements of ancient and modern Chinese culture." This year, Albania translated and published Zhou Libo's novel "Hurricane," and performed the Chinese opera "The White-Haired Girl." Many viewers who watched "The White-Haired Girl" said to Chinese students: "I was so moved that I shed tears, but I am willing to shed tears again." The Albanian people and the Chinese people have the same experiences and the same feelings. Their thoughts and feelings are common and consistent. When the Chinese people achieved the great revolutionary victory, the Albanian people regarded it as their own victory. The Albanian people fully support the Chinese people's struggle to safeguard their territorial integrity and sovereignty. Comrade Paçrami emphasized, "The Albanian people believe that Taiwan has always been the territory of the Chinese people, and any attempt to erase or distort this historical fact is untenable. Only returning Taiwan to China is the only correct way to solve this problem."

　　Finally, we asked Comrade Paçrami to talk about the tasks of the Albanian Cultural Delegation's visit to China this time. He said that the purpose of the delegation is to better understand the achievements of the Chinese people after liberation, especially in culture and art, so as to enhance cultural exchanges between China and Albania and the friendly relations between the two peoples. He said:

　　"Chinese comrades have provided us with all the conveniences so that we can see and hear many interesting things. We will also visit various places." But he then said that this is only half of the task, and the other half is to be completed after returning home. After the delegation returns home in the future, it will convey what it has seen and heard in China to the Albanian people. Poets will write articles, painters will hold painting exhibitions, and all members of the delegation will go to various places to report.

　　When we said goodbye to Chairman Paçrami, we felt a sense of satisfaction and joy. Although it was only a brief visit, the conversation was filled with the extremely deep friendship between the people of the two countries.

　　访问阿尔巴尼亚文化代表团团长法迪尔·帕奇拉米
　　本报记者　泉璧　苏新
    在一个久雨初晴的下午，我们访问了来到北京不久的阿尔巴尼亚文化代表团团长法迪尔·帕奇拉米同志。
    魁梧的身材，健壮的体格，使人一望就知道帕奇拉米同志是一个精力充沛的人。我们虽然是初次相逢，但是中阿两国人民相互并不陌生，我们也一见如故，毫不拘束地就畅谈起来。
    谈话自然地从阿尔巴尼亚的文化艺术开始的。他首先向我们介绍了阿尔巴尼亚文学艺术为和平与社会主义事业服务的情形，和阿尔巴尼亚文化建设的成就。他说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府在各方面的政策都是为了和平与社会主义。这一点也很明显地反映在文学艺术方面。几乎所有新的文艺作品都围绕着这个主题，目的都是为了维护世界和平的事业，为了鼓舞阿尔巴尼亚人民更加努力地去争取社会主义的美好前途。这里可以举出一些作家的作品，例如：米乔·卡拉马塔的
  “可疑的朋友”——它揭露了美、英帝国主义分子在地拉那的阴谋活动，季米特里·舒特里基的长诗“飞翔的鸽子”，贝西姆·列冯的剧本“忘不了的创伤”，短舞剧“各民族友谊”与“和平的旗帜”，乌·哈达利的雕塑“少女和鸽子”等等。最近三年来，阿尔巴尼亚又出现了几部新的小说。季·舒特里利基的长篇小说“解放者”写阿尔巴尼亚劳动党成长的历史和它争取人民幸福的斗争，斯德利奥·斯巴修的“他们不是孤立的”和金·杜希的“凡拉那的道路”，反映了阿尔巴尼亚农民在解放前反抗封建统治、争取土地和解放后组织农业生产合作社、对农村中残存的阶级敌人进行的斗争。
    阿尔巴尼亚文学艺术的成就，是在整个文化事业日益繁荣的基础上获得的。谈到这里时，帕奇拉米同志随手从旁边的桌上拿起了一本小册子。他一面翻看，一面兴奋地列举了许多数字：全国学校和在学人数比战前增加了三倍，高等学校从一所也没有增加到六所，新建了六个剧院和十一个博物馆，去年有二千多个业余艺术小组参加了文艺比赛，每年出版的书籍全国每人平均可以得到二、三本，全国三十七种报刊每年发行量达一千六百万份……。这些数字清楚地证明了解放后的阿尔巴尼亚文化事业的飞跃发展。
    解放以前，阿尔巴尼亚人民过的日子就像北极漫长而寒冷的黑夜。外国帝国主义者和本国的反动统治阶级吸尽了人民的脂膏，使他们衣不蔽体，食不果腹。人民又那里有可能来获得文化呢？那时候，阿尔巴尼亚的文化和经济一样，是欧洲各国中最落后的。
    但是，当十年多以前，阿尔巴尼亚人民在苏联击溃法西斯德国伟大胜利的影响下经过英勇的斗争获得解放以后，这个亚得里亚海畔古国的一切都开始改变了。恩维尔·霍查指出：“我们需要一种帮助人民工作和生产的文化，我们也必须使这种文化成为劳动群众手中的一种武器……”。几年来，恩维尔·霍查的指示已经变成了现实。
    在人民政权的年代里，用本国语文出版的书籍超过了过去的几个世纪；在国内外受高等教育的人数比过去五十多年还多。人民的艺术，也像春天的花朵那样到处盛开。新的文化推动了阿尔巴尼亚社会主义建设事业的前进，改变了社会的面貌。
      “当然，这一切同党的领导和关怀是分不开的”，帕奇拉米同志在指出阿尔巴尼亚劳动党对发展文化艺术上的重要作用时强调了这一点。他说，根据马克思列宁主义的指示，没有有文化的干部，没有文明的人，就不可能建成社会主义。因此阿尔巴尼亚劳动党十分注意发展文化、教育和艺术的工作，并尽量吸取苏联和各人民民主国家在这方面的经验。今年四月间在地拉那举行的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央全会，曾专门讨论了关于党的思想政治工作，规定了改善这一工作的具体措施。在全会的决议中也指出要进一步加强党对文化艺术工作的领导，和改善文艺工作者进行创作的条件。无疑的，这次全会的决议将会使阿尔巴尼亚的文化艺术得到新的高涨。
    谈到这里，话题转到中阿文化交流和中阿两国人民的友好关系上来。帕奇拉米同志说，中阿两国的文化交流，最近几年来有了显著的发展，特别是在去年签订了科学技术合作协定和文化协定以后，文化交流更趋密切了。在两国之间，曾经互相举办了不少的展览会，交换了留学生，出版机构互相出版书籍介绍对方的历史、经济和文化。一九五二年中国青年文工团曾去阿尔巴尼亚进行访问演出，这次阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团是阿尔巴尼亚访问中国的第一个艺术团体。
    帕奇拉米同志告诉我们，阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民怀有深厚的感情，“他们渴望了解中国古老的和现代的文化的成就”。今年，阿尔巴尼亚翻译出版了周立波的小说“暴风骤雨”，演出了中国的歌剧“白毛女”。许多看了“白毛女”的观众对中国留学生说：“我感动得流泪了，但我愿意再去流一次泪。”阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民具有同样的经历，同样的感受，他们的思想感情是共同的，一致的。当中国人民获得伟大的革命胜利的时候，阿尔巴尼亚人民把这当作是他们自己的胜利。阿尔巴尼亚人民全力支持中国人民维护自己的领土和主权完整的斗争。帕奇拉米同志着重地说，“阿尔巴尼亚人民认为，台湾一向是中国人民的领土，任何企图抹杀或歪曲这个历史事实的言论都是站不住脚的。只有把台湾归还给中国才是解决这个问题的唯一正确的办法。”
    最后，我们请求帕奇拉米同志谈一谈这次阿尔巴尼亚文化代表团访问中国的任务。他说，代表团的目的是要更好地了解中国人民在解放以后所获得的成就，特别是文化艺术方面的成就，以便增进中阿文化交流和中阿两国人民的友好关系。他说：
  “中国同志们为我们提供了一切的便利条件，使我们看到和听到了很多有兴趣的东西。我们还将去各地访问。”但他接着表示，这只是任务的一半，另一半是要回国去完成的。代表团将来返国以后，将把在中国所见所闻传达给阿尔巴尼亚人民，诗人要写文章，画家要举行画展，代表团的全体团员都要到各处去作报告。
    当我们同帕奇拉米团长告别出来的时候，我们感到一种满足的喜悦。虽然只是一次短暂的访问，但是谈话中洋溢的是两国人民之间极其深厚的友情。
