Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, August 26th: Workers constructing the Ji-Er Line are accelerating the progress of various projects to strive for the early participation of this railway in joint transportation. The earth and stone works for many large stations such as the Jining Hub Station and the Erlian Station, which are planned to be completed this year, have been completed. Station buildings, warehouses, signal towers, and neat platforms are successively appearing on the station yards. In the Jining area alone, 126 houses have been completed, with a construction area of more than 64,000 square meters. By mid-August, nearly 80 percent of the construction of station buildings, factories, and residential houses along the entire line had been completed; the rest are also under intense construction. The construction of workshops such as the washing and inspection depot, the wheel-dropping depot, and the Jining Machinery Factory, which must be completed before joint transportation, are planned to be completed successively in September and October.

On the boundless grassland, stone is scarce. The workers constructing the Ji-Er Line overcame the difficulty of transporting stone from afar, so that ballast laying has been completed more than 80 percent. In the ballast laying work, the workers adopted the advanced tool of the ballast unloading plow used by Soviet and Mongolian railway workers. Previously, it took 60 people one and a half hours to unload a trainload of ballast, but now it only takes four people ten minutes using the ballast unloading plow. Signal workers starting from Jining have installed signals on the track that has been laid with ballast to the north of Baiyinhaer Station, 138 kilometers away from Jining. These signal devices are the latest products from the Soviet Union. During installation, Soviet experts from Beijing continuously provide guidance. All bridges and culverts along the entire line have been repaired and supplemented.

The Ji-Er Line Acceptance and Handover Preparatory Office has fully launched its work. Technical personnel responsible for acceptance, who have set off for the site, will conduct preliminary acceptance of various completed projects and assist the site to complete various uncompleted projects on schedule or ahead of schedule. In addition, 50 percent of the broad-gauge locomotives, vehicles, and passenger cars that will run on the Ji-Er Line during joint transportation have been transported to Jining North Station.

　　集二线职工紧张劳动争取铁路早日联运
    新华社呼和浩特二十六日电　修筑集二线的职工们，正在加快各项工程进度，争取早日使这条铁路参加联运。计划在今年完成的集宁枢纽站、二连站等许多大车站站场的土、石方工程已经完工。一栋栋的车站建筑物、仓库、信号楼和整齐的站台，正在站场上相继出现。集宁地区全部完工的房屋就有一百二十六栋，建筑面积达六万四千多平方公尺。全线车站站房、工厂、住宅等房屋建筑，到八月中旬，已有近百分之八十的工程全部完工；其余的也都在紧张施工。联运前必须完成的洗检库、落轮库和集宁机械工厂等厂房建筑，计划在九、十月份相继建成。
    一望无际的草原上，缺乏石料。修筑集二线的工人们克服了从远途运石料的困难，使铺碴工程完成了百分之八十以上。在铺碴工作中，工人们采用了苏、蒙铁路职工的先进工具卸碴犁，以前一列车石碴需要六十个人一小时半才能卸完，现在采用卸碴犁后只要四个人十分钟就可卸完了。从集宁出发的信号工人们，已在铺完道碴的线路上把信号安装到了离集宁一百三十八公里的白音哈尔车站以北。这些信号装置都是苏联最新的出品，在安装中，不断有从北京来的苏联专家进行指导。全线所有的桥梁、涵管已经整修和补修完毕。
    集二线验收交接筹备处已经全面展开工作。出发到现场的负责验收的技术人员即将对各项已完工程进行初验，并协助现场按期或提前完成各项未完工程。此外，联运时将要行驶在集二线上的宽轨机车、车辆和客车已有百分之五十运到集宁北站。
