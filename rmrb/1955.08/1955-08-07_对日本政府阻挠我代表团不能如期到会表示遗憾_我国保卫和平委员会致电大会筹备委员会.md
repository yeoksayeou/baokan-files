Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The China Peace Committee cabled the preparatory committee of the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in Japan, expressing regret that the Chinese delegation could not attend as scheduled due to the unreasonable obstruction of the Japanese government. The cable is as follows:

Mr. Ikuo Yasui, Japan Preparatory Committee of the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs:

The Chinese delegation headed by Liu Ningyi has arrived in Hong Kong, but according to the Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong, the Japanese government will only issue visas to three members of the Chinese delegation. Due to this situation, and also because Mr. Chen Tiqiang had matters to attend to in China, we intended to send Mr. Zhao Puchu and translator Ms. An Shuqu to participate in the conference first, but the Japanese government still attached the following incomprehensible so-called preconditions to them: 1. The travel itinerary must be submitted to the Minister of Justice in writing in advance; 2. Act in accordance with the travel itinerary. If there are any changes to the itinerary, the Minister of Justice must be notified of the changes 48 hours in advance; 3. Do not engage in activities other than the purpose of entry; 4. Comply with the above conditions, and if there is any violation, they may be ordered to leave Japan. The Chinese delegation immediately expressed to the Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong that these conditions were completely unacceptable. The Chinese delegation is going to Japan at the invitation of the Japanese Preparatory Committee to participate in the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and to express condolences to the people of Japan who have suffered from atomic bomb disasters. The purpose is very clear. The itinerary of the Chinese delegation after arriving in Japan will be arranged by the Japanese Preparatory Committee. This is a matter of common sense, therefore the so-called preconditions put forward by the Japanese government are unreasonable and very impolite, and even a deliberate insult to our Chinese delegation. The Chinese delegation naturally cannot accept such unreasonable conditions. Now the Chinese delegation is still negotiating with the Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong. Although the Japanese Consulate said that it has conveyed the opinions of the Chinese delegation to the Japanese government, there has been no result so far. It would be a great pity if the Chinese delegation cannot arrive in Japan in time before the opening of the conference. Please convey the respect of the Chinese delegation to all colleagues at the conference and wish the conference a successful opening.

    对日本政府阻挠我代表团不能如期到会表示遗憾
    我国保卫和平委员会致电大会筹备委员会
    新华社六日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会致电日本禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会筹备委员会，对由于日本政府的无理阻挠中国代表团不能如期到会表示遗憾。电文如下：禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会日本筹备委员会安井郁先生：
    以刘宁一为首的中国代表团人员已到达香港，但据日本驻香港领事馆表示，日本政府仅对中国代表团中三人可以发给签证。由于此种情况，又兼陈体强先生有事留在国内，我们打算先由赵朴初先生和翻译安淑渠女士赶往参加大会，但日本政府对他们仍附加以下难以理解的所谓先决条件，即：一、事先须将旅行日程以书面提交法务大臣；二、按照旅行日程行动，如日程有变更，须于四十八小时前将变更内容通知法务大臣；三、不作入境目的以外的活动；四、要遵守上列条件，如有违反，得令其离开日本。中国代表团当即向日本驻香港领事馆表示，这些条件是根本无法接受的。中国代表团赴日是应日本筹备委员会邀请参加禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会，并对日本遭受原子弹灾害的人民表示慰问，目的十分明白。中国代表团赴日以后的日程，当由日本筹备委员会安排，此事已属常识内事，因此日本政府提出的所谓先决条件，是毫无理由，而且是很不礼貌的，甚至是对我中国代表团的存心侮辱。中国代表团自然不能接受这种无理的条件。现在中国代表团仍在香港继续向日本驻香港领事馆进行交涉，日本领事馆虽说已将中国代表团意见转达日本政府，但至今并无结果。中国代表团如在大会开幕前还不能及时赶到日本，真是万分遗憾，望向大会各同仁转致中国代表团的敬意并祝大会的胜利开幕。
