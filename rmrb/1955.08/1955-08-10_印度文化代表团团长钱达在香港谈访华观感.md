Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 9th. According to a report in the Hong Kong "Wen Wei Po" on the 9th, the Indian cultural delegation, headed by Chanda, arrived in Hong Kong on the 8th while on its way home after visiting China.

Chanda told reporters that we had an extremely pleasant time in China. He said that we noticed that this great country is moving forward.

Chanda said that the Indian cultural delegation could see construction activities everywhere in China. He also noted that cities like Urumqi, far on the frontier of the country, now have huge modern factories, and that the railway connecting the northwest is under construction.

Chanda said that the extent to which the Chinese people appreciated our performances exceeded our expectations. Our classical music is difficult to understand, but they can understand every beautiful performance, and we can immediately see their reaction. He said that this shows that the Chinese people have a good appreciation and great love for art.

Chanda said that India sent a cultural delegation to China in the hope of strengthening relations with all countries. He said that China and India have already conducted such cultural exchanges. He expressed his belief that visits by delegations like this would increase.

    印度文化代表团团长钱达在香港谈访华观感
    新华社广州九日电　据香港“文汇报”九日报道，以钱达为首的印度文化代表团在中国访问后回国途中，八日到达香港。
    钱达对新闻记者发表谈话说，我们在中国度过了一段极其愉快的时间。他说，我们注意到，这个伟大的国家正在前进。
    钱达说，印度文化代表团在中国的每一个地方都可以看到各方面的建筑活动。他也注意到，像远在这个国家边疆上的都市乌鲁木齐，现在也已经有了巨大的现代化工厂，而连接西北的铁路正在修筑中。
    钱达说，中国人民欣赏我们的表演的程度是出于我们意料之外的。我们的古典音乐是难懂的，但是他们能够懂得每一个优美的弹奏，而且我们能够立即看到他们的反应。他说，这说明了中国人民对于艺术有良好的鉴赏力和极大的热爱。
    钱达说，印度由于希望加强同一切国家的关系，所以派遣了一个文化代表团到中国去。他说，中国和印度已经互相进行了这种文化访问。他表示相信，像这样的代表团的访问还会增加。
