    Four New Aquatic Product Farms Built in Fujian Province
    The Aquatic Product Bureau of the Fujian Provincial Department of Agriculture has newly built four aquatic product farms in Jinjiang, Putian, Ningde, and Fuqing counties. Together with the original two aquatic product farms in Lianjiang and Fuzhou, there are now a total of six farms, with a combined operating area of more than 8,500 mu. It is estimated that this year they can produce more than 6 million jin of clams, blood clams, and freshwater fish. At present, all saltwater farms have completed the task of seeding shellfish and have begun harvesting razor clams and clams. The freshwater farms have sent people to fish fry production areas in Jiangxi and other places to purchase fish fry.
    In the second half of the year, the Fujian Provincial Aquatic Product Bureau plans to build two more aquatic product farms in Yunxiao and Changle counties, and the survey and design work has been completed. After these two aquatic product farms are completed, it is estimated that the breeding area can be expanded by more than 2,000 mu, increasing the production of razor clams and freshwater fish by 400,000 to 500,000 jin.

    福建省新建四处水产养殖场
    福建省农业厅水产局在晋江、莆田、宁德、福清等县新建了四处水产养殖场，加上原有连江、福州两处水产养殖场，共计六处，经营面积达八千五百多亩，预计今年能生产蛤、蚶、淡水鱼等六百多万斤。目前，各咸水养殖场已完成了贝苗播种任务，开始采收蛏和蛤。各淡水养殖场已派人前往江西等地的鱼苗产区采购鱼苗。
    福建省水产局下半年还准备在云霄、长乐两县再增建两处水产养殖场，目前已完成了勘察和设计工作。这两个水产养殖场建成以后，估计可扩大养殖面积二千多亩，能增产蛏、淡水鱼四十万斤到五十万斤。　（黄玉楠）
