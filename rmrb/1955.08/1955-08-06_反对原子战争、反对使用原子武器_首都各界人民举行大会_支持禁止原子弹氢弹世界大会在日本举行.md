Xinhua News Agency, August 5th—People from all walks of life in the capital solemnly held a meeting on August 5th to oppose atomic war and the use of atomic weapons. This meeting was held in response to the call from the Asian Countries Conference and the World Peace Conference for disarmament and the complete prohibition of atomic weapons.

    The more than 1,500 people present unanimously passed a resolution congratulating the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, which opened in Hiroshima, Japan, on August 6th, and powerfully pointed out that the 600 million Chinese people are the loyal comrades-in-arms of all people in the world who oppose atomic war. The conference expressed its heartfelt condolences to the Japanese people in their disastrous situation and its warm support for the Japanese people's struggle against atomic war and atomic weapons. The resolution emphasized that the Chinese people have always been friends of the Japanese people. The Chinese people will steadfastly advance to strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people and to restore normal relations between China and Japan as soon as possible.

    Today's meeting was held at 3:30 PM. Seated on the rostrum were leaders of various Chinese people's organizations and people from all walks of life, including Chen Shutong, Li Dequan, Lei Renmin, Liao Chengzhi, Li Jiebo, Zhang Yun, Wu Han, Hou Debang, Peng Zemin, Yang Jingren, Hu Yuzhi, Luo Longji, Xu Deheng, Xu Baoju, Liu Guanyi, Wang Zizhong, Neng Hai, Prit, President of the British Peace Committee, Juan Martinez Campos, head of the Chilean Peace Delegation, and Kozo Kameta and Vantureri, Deputy Secretaries-General of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee. The entire audience greeted them with warm applause as they ascended the rostrum.

    Participating in today's meeting were leaders of various Chinese people's organizations, members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing, trade union workers, youth workers, women workers, scientists and educators, doctors, nurses, journalists, cadres of government organs, Buddhists, Muslims, Christians, and more than 1,500 other people.

    The meeting was presided over by Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairman of the China Peace Committee, who also spoke first at the meeting.  Following him, Li Dequan, Lei Renmin, Li Jiebo, Prit, and Kozo Kameta spoke. Each speaker was warmly welcomed.

    Chen Shutong said: People around the world who love peace, in view of the serious threat posed by atomic weapons to human safety, have launched a worldwide movement against atomic weapons. Now this movement has formed an extremely powerful force. It is a strong expression of the will, conscience, and strength of the people of the world. It once stopped the war forces' attempt to use atomic weapons in Korea and Indochina and powerfully deterred the war forces' evil plans.

    Chen Shutong then spoke about the consistent and enormous efforts made by the Soviet Union in disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. He believes that this is fully in line with the urgent wishes of the people of all countries in the world. The Chinese people warmly support the major efforts made by the Soviet Union for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. Chen Shutong said: We Chinese people, like all peace-loving people in the world, have always resolutely advocated disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people have enthusiastically participated in and supported the movement against the use of atomic weapons. As is well known, more than 220 million people in China signed in support of the Stockholm Appeal, more than 300 million people signed in support of the Five Great Powers concluding a peace pact, and more than 400 million people signed in support of the Vienna "Appeal to the People of the World." All of these powerfully express the Chinese people's unwavering will to safeguard peace.

    Chen Shutong pointed out that the Japanese people have suffered three tragic atomic explosions, first in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and then during the hydrogen bomb test on Bikini Island. Therefore, the Japanese people's demand to oppose the use of atomic weapons is particularly strong. The World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, which will be held in Hiroshima on August 6th, further demonstrates the new high tide in the development of the movement against atomic weapons. We express our warm support for this conference held in Japan and sincerely wish the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and the international struggle of the people of all countries against atomic weapons brilliant success!

    Chen Shutong also spoke of the Chinese people's warm sympathy and support for the Japanese people's struggle against atomic and hydrogen bombs and the Chinese people's heartfelt hope for improving relations between China and Japan. He said: In the cause of safeguarding peace, the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people is growing day by day, and exchanges are becoming more frequent, which is beneficial to the cause of safeguarding peace. The Chinese and Japanese people have a traditional friendly relationship of two thousand years. The Chinese and Japanese people were, are, and will be friendly. In recent years, with the assistance of the Chinese government and friendly consultations between Chinese and Japanese people's organizations, the issue of Japanese nationals returning to their country has been properly resolved, and positive results have also been achieved on the issue of fisheries and trade. However, we cannot fail to notice that China and Japan have not lifted the state of war and restored normal relations since the end of World War II. Although the Chinese side has taken many positive measures, the Japanese government has not responded accordingly. This is regrettable. We sincerely hope that relations between China and Japan can be improved, economic and trade restrictions between China and Japan can be eliminated, and other issues that remain to be resolved between the two countries can be resolved. This will not only enhance the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people but also promote the development of the cause of safeguarding peace to which the Chinese and Japanese people are jointly committed. The Chinese people have already made many positive efforts in this regard, and future progress depends on the response of the Japanese authorities.

    Chen Shutong concluded by saying: The world's people's demand for disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the elimination of the threat of new wars is an irresistible trend. This wish of the world's people must be fulfilled. Facts show that the united strength of the people of the world has had a tremendous impact on promoting the relaxation of the international situation. In the future, as long as the people of all countries in the world continue to unite, we will surely continue to achieve new victories and achievements.

    Li Dequan, President of the Red Cross Society of China, said in her speech that the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, which will be held in Hiroshima, Japan, starting tomorrow, is a new contribution to the cause of world peace. The Japanese people are the first victims to directly suffer from atomic disaster, and their feelings of hatred and opposition to atomic weapons are fully understandable to the Chinese people. From a humanitarian standpoint, the Red Cross Society of China expresses its deep sympathy for the suffering endured by the Japanese people over the past decade due to atomic bomb explosions and hydrogen bomb tests. We are willing to join hands with peace-loving Red Cross workers from all countries to ensure that the disaster of atomic war never endangers humanity again.

    Li Dequan used the Red Cross Society of China's assistance in the repatriation of Japanese nationals from China as an example to illustrate that the Chinese people not only actively support the Japanese people in the cause of defending world peace but also have made considerable efforts in promoting friendly and cooperative relations between the two peoples. She said that after the founding of the People's Republic of China, there were still about 35,000 Japanese nationals remaining in China. As early as the end of 1952, our government announced that it had entrusted the Red Cross Society of China to cooperate with corresponding organizations on the Japanese side to assist Japanese nationals in China to return to their country. From March 1953 to March 1955, over a period of two years, the Red Cross Society of China, together with the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Liaison Council, jointly assisted more than 29,000 Japanese nationals to return to their country. As far as we know, when the last group of Japanese nationals returned to their country in March 1955, all Japanese nationals who were willing to return at that time had already returned to Japan. Therefore, the issue of the return of Japanese nationals in China has been properly resolved under the friendly cooperation of relevant Chinese and Japanese organizations. The smooth realization of this work has played an important role in strengthening the unity and friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people and in promoting cooperation and exchanges between the two peoples. This is something that all those who truly want China-Japan to develop friendly relations are satisfied and happy about.

    Li Dequan continued by saying that there are currently about 6,000 Japanese nationals remaining in China who have expressed their unwillingness to return to their country, and we have no reason or right to force them to leave China. The Red Cross Society of China is willing to continue to provide assistance to Japanese nationals in China who apply to return to their country in the future. Therefore, anyone among the Japanese nationals in China can apply to return to their country at any time. However, we cannot help but feel regret that we recently heard that some irresponsible people in Japan actually said that more than 40,000 Japanese nationals were being detained in China. We believe that people who say such things can only be intentionally trying to undermine the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people; otherwise, it is difficult to make other explanations. On the other hand, the whereabouts of a large number of Chinese people who were abducted to Japan from various parts of China and Southeast Asia during the war are still unknown. Although some remains of Chinese martyrs who died in Japan have been shipped back with the kind assistance of people from all walks of life in Japan, we express our gratitude for this. However, the Japanese government has not yet made any statement about the surviving people, and overseas Chinese in Japan are still unable to freely contact and communicate with their motherland. These are all issues that the Chinese people are now concerned about.

    Lei Renmin, Vice-Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, said in his speech that the Chinese people deeply sympathize with and warmly support the Japanese people's struggle against atomic and hydrogen bombs and support the resolutions of the Asian Countries Conference and the Helsinki World Peace Conference on demanding disarmament and the complete prohibition of atomic weapons.

    Lei Renmin said that the Chinese and Japanese people have a history of peaceful coexistence for thousands of years and have a long history of economic and cultural exchanges, which is beneficial to both peoples.

    Lei Renmin said that in March of this year, our country sent a trade delegation to visit Japan, which opened up the way for further development of China-Japan trade relations. He said that during our negotiations in Japan, we made unremitting efforts for the normal development of trade relations between the two countries and put forward practical and feasible suggestions that are in line with the interests of both countries on the issues of the two countries' national banks signing a payment agreement and the mutual establishment of permanent commercial representative offices, which are of great importance for the development of international trade relations. These suggestions were also warmly supported by the Japanese business community and the broad masses of the people. However, because the Japanese government has not yet adopted a positive attitude towards this China-Japan trade negotiation, these important issues cannot be realized immediately and require continued efforts.

    Lei Renmin emphasized that developing trade exchanges between countries plays an active role in promoting the peaceful economic prosperity and development of various countries, improving people's lives, enhancing friendly relations between countries, and promoting peaceful coexistence among all countries in the world, and it is also in line with the wishes and interests of the people of all countries in the world. We advocate removing artificial obstacles and opening up trade between China and Japan. However, trade between China and Japan is still subject to undue restrictions. We believe that this abnormal situation should be improved, and we hope that it can be improved. The Chinese people are willing to work together with the Japanese people to improve trade relations between China and Japan, for the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese people, and for the normalization of relations between China and Japan. We believe that as long as the Japanese government takes concrete and effective measures, provides practical support for new trade agreements, and removes artificial obstacles and restrictions, it can improve China-Japan trade relations and expand China-Japan trade.

    Lei Renmin also said that during our visit to Japan, we saw the Japanese people's enthusiastic desire for China-Japan friendship, the normalization of China-Japan relations, and the normalization of trade relations. The delegation was warmly welcomed by the Japanese people and people from all walks of life everywhere, and many scenes were indeed very moving. These all demonstrate the deep friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people, which cannot be cut off by any artificial obstacles or restrictions.

    Li Jiebo, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said in his speech that the Chinese working class, like the working class of all countries, actively supports the call of the World Peace Conference and is willing to join the working class of all countries in struggling to promote disarmament and the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons. Li Jiebo said that the Chinese working class warmly sympathizes with and supports the Japanese people's struggle to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs. The Chinese working class warmly supports the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and wishes the conference a complete success.

    Li Jiebo said that we are very sorry that the Chinese delegation, headed by Liu Ningyi, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, was unable to go to Japan to attend the Hiroshima conference in full and in a timely manner because the Japanese government only issued partial visas. Li Jiebo continued by saying: But we are willing to tell the Japanese people that the Japanese people's struggle against atomic war and atomic weapons will receive the warm support of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people.

    Prit, President of the British Peace Committee, expressed his deep sympathy at the meeting to the millions of Japanese people who directly suffered from atomic disaster. Prit said: But sympathy is not enough; we must strive to ensure that this crime never happens again. I believe that in Japan, in China, in Asia, and on other continents, the forces of peace are now powerful enough to declare atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons illegal. The power of public opinion is today powerful enough to create a new atmosphere that makes the use of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons impossible. But the forces of peace must never relax their vigilance. I believe that if they maintain their vigilance and wisely use this great power, they can finally defeat the threat of atomic and hydrogen bomb war and achieve greater victories in the struggle for peace.

    Kozo Kameta, Deputy Secretary-General of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee, spoke at the meeting. He said that as a member of the Japanese people who have suffered tragic disasters from atomic and hydrogen bombs, I express my deep gratitude for today's meeting. Kozo Kameta said that although nuclear weapons have unprecedented destructive power, we firmly believe that the unity and constructive power of peace-loving people is far more powerful than any destructive power, and peace will surely defeat war. Kozo Kameta also said that we join the 1.6 billion people in Asia and the Pacific region and the peace-loving people all over the world in mourning the people who died in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Bikini. We are determined to fight to ensure that the use of atomic and hydrogen bombs never happens again and are determined to strive for universal disarmament and the development of the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    Subsequently, all the attendees unanimously passed the resolution of the Capital People's Conference Against Atomic War and Against the Use of Atomic Weapons. After the resolution was passed, the meeting hall resounded with warm applause.

    反对原子战争、反对使用原子武器
    首都各界人民举行大会
    支持禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会在日本举行
    新华社五日讯　首都各界人民在八月五日隆重举行反对原子战争与反对使用原子武器大会。这次大会是为了响应亚洲国家会议和世界和平大会关于要求裁减军备、完全禁止原子武器的号召而举行的。
    到会的一千五百多人一致通过的决议，向八月六日在日本广岛开幕的禁止原子弹、氢弹世界大会表示祝贺，有力地指出六万万中国人民是全世界所有反对原子战争的人们的忠实战友。大会对陷于灾难处境的日本人民致以亲切的慰问，对日本人民反对原子战争与反对原子武器的斗争表示热烈支持。决议着重说：中国人民始终是日本人民的朋友。中国人民将为加强中日人民的友好与早日恢复中日间正常关系而坚定地前进。
    今天的大会在下午三时三十分举行。在主席台上就座的有我国各人民团体的负责人和社会各界人士陈叔通、李德全、雷任民、廖承志、李颉伯、章蕴、吴晗、侯德榜、彭泽民、杨静仁、胡愈之、罗隆基、许德珩、许宝驹、刘贯一、王梓仲、能海，英国和平委员会会长普里特，智利和平代表团团长胡安·马丁涅斯·康普斯，亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会副秘书长龟田东伍、万徒勒里，当他们登上主席台时，全场报以热烈的掌声。
    参加今天大会的，有我国各人民团体的负责人，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会在京委员，工会工作者，青年工作者，妇女工作者，科学家和教育工作者，医生，护士，新闻工作者，机关干部，佛教徒，伊斯兰教徒，基督教徒等一千五百多人。
    大会由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席陈叔通主持，他并在会上首先讲话。接着在会上讲话的有李德全、雷任民、李颉伯、普里特、龟田东伍，每一个发言者都受到热烈的欢迎。
    陈叔通说：全世界爱好和平的人民鉴于原子武器对人类安全的严重威胁，展开了世界规模的反对原子武器运动。现在这个运动已经形成为一股强大无比的力量了，它是世界人民的意志、良心和力量的坚强表现，它曾经制止了战争势力企图在朝鲜和印度支那使用原子武器的罪行，有力地阻遏了战争势力的罪恶计划。
    陈叔通接着谈到苏联在裁减军备和禁止原子武器方面所作的一贯的巨大努力，他认为这是完全符合世界各国人民的迫切愿望的。中国人民热烈支持苏联为裁减军备和禁止原子武器所作的重大努力。陈叔通说：我们中国人民同世界一切爱好和平的人民一样，一贯坚决主张裁减军备、禁止原子武器、并主张把原子能用于和平目的。中华人民共和国成立以来，中国人民热烈参加和支持反对使用原子武器的运动。众所周知的，中国有二亿二千多万人签名拥护斯德哥尔摩宣言，有三亿以上的人签名拥护五大国缔结和平公约，有四亿以上的人签名拥护维也纳“告全世界人民书”。这些都十分有力地表达出中国人民维护和平的不可动摇的意志。
    陈叔通指出，日本人民曾经先后在广岛、长崎以及在比基尼岛试验氢弹时遭到过三次原子爆炸的惨重灾害，因此，日本人民反对使用原子武器的要求也来得特别强烈。这次在八月六日在广岛举行的禁止原子弹、氢弹世界大会；更表明反对原子武器运动的新发展的高潮。我们对于这次在日本召开的大会表示热烈支持，并衷心预祝禁止原子弹、氢弹世界大会和世界各国人民反对原子武器的国际斗争行动，获得光辉的成功！
    陈叔通还谈到中国人民对日本人民反对原子弹、氢弹斗争的热烈的同情和支持，谈到中国人民对改善中日两国关系的衷心期望，他说：在维护和平事业中，中日两国人民的友谊日有增进，往来日渐频繁，这对维护和平事业是有利的。中日两国人民具有两千年的传统友好关系，中日两国人民过去是，现在和将来也是友好的。近年来在中国政府的协助和中日两国人民团体友好协商之下，已妥善地解决了日侨回国问题，对渔业问题和贸易问题也获得了积极的结果。但是，我们不能不注意到中日两国从第二次世界大战结束以来，一直没有解除战争状态，恢复正常关系。中国方面虽然曾经采取了许多积极措施，但日本政府却没有相应的反应。这是令人感到遗憾的。我们衷心希望中日两国的关系能够得到改善，中日两国的经济贸易限制能够消除，存在于两国间尚待解决的其他问题能够得到解决。这不仅将增进中日两国人民的友好关系，而且也将促进中日两国人民所共同致力的维护和平事业的发展。中国人民在这各方面已经做了许多积极的努力，今后的进展如何，尚有待于日本当局的反应。
    陈叔通最后说：世界人民要求裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁是不可抗拒的潮流。世界人民的这个愿望必须予以满足。事实表明，世界人民团结一致的力量，已在促使国际局势的缓和方面产生了巨大影响。今后只要世界各国人民继续团结一致，我们就一定能不断取得新的胜利和成就。
    中国红十字会总会会长李德全在讲话时说，从明天起，将在日本广岛举行禁止原子弹、氢弹世界大会，这是对世界和平事业的一个新贡献。日本人民是第一个直接遭受原子灾难的牺牲者，他们憎恶和反对原子武器的心情是中国人民完全可以理解的。中国红十字会本着人道立场，对日本人民过去十年来由于原子弹轰炸和氢弹试验所遭受的痛苦，寄予深切的同情。我们愿意和爱好和平的各国红十字工作者联合行动起来，使原子战争的灾难永远不再危害人类。
    李德全以中国红十字会协助在华日侨回国为例，说明中国人民不仅在保卫世界和平事业中积极支持日本人民，而且在促进中日两国人民的友好合作关系方面也做了不少的努力。她说，中华人民共和国成立后，留在中国的日本侨民还有三万五千名左右。我国政府远在一九五二年底就宣布委托中国红十字会与日本方面相应的团体协商合作，协助在华日侨回国。从一九五三年三月到一九五五年三月两年间，中国红十字会同日本红十字会、日中友好协会和日本和平联络会共同努力协助了二万九千多名日侨回国。据我们所知，在一九五五年三月最后一批日侨回国时，所有当时愿意回国的日侨，都已返回日本。因此，在中国的日侨回国的问题在中日有关团体的友好合作下已经妥善地解决了。这项工作的顺利实现，对加强中日两国人民的团结和友谊，对促进中日两国人民的合作与往来都起了重要的推动作用。这是所有真正愿意中日发展友好关系的人都感到满意和高兴的事。
    李德全接着说，目前留在中国的日侨，还有六千人左右，他们自己表示不愿回国，我们没有理由也没有权利强迫他们离开中国。中国红十字会对以后申请回国的日侨愿意继续予以协助，因此，在华日侨中的任何人可以在任何时候申请回国。但是我们不得不感到遗憾，最近听说日本方面竟有人不负责任的说什么有日侨四万多人被扣留在中国，我们认为说这种话的人们，只能是有意破坏中日两国人民间的友好关系，否则很难作其他解释。另一方面，在战争期间由中国各地和南洋等地被掳到日本去的大批中国人却至今下落不明。虽然在日本各界人民的善意协助下，曾经运回一些在日殉难的中国烈士的遗骨，我们对此表示感谢。但是，日本政府对生存的人至今还没有做过任何交代，在日本的华侨还不能自由地同祖国联系和往来，这些问题都是中国人民现在所关怀的。
    中国国际贸易促进委员会副主席雷任民在讲话中表示，中国人民非常同情和热烈支持日本人民反对原子弹、氢弹的斗争，拥护亚洲国家会议和赫尔辛基世界和平大会关于要求裁减军备和完全禁止原子武器的决议。
    雷任民说，中日两国人民有着几千年和平相处的历史，有着悠久的经济往来和文化交流的关系，这种历史和关系对于两国人民都是有利的。
    雷任民说，今年三月间，我国派出了一个贸易代表团去日本访问，使中日贸易关系的进一步发展开辟了道路。他说，我们在日本谈判期间，为了两国贸易关系的正常发展，曾做了不懈的努力，对于发展国际贸易关系有着重要作用的两国国家银行签订支付协定和两国互设常驻商务代表机构问题，曾经提出了切实可行的符合两国利益的建议，也获得日本工商界和广大人民的热烈支持；但由于日本政府对此次中日贸易谈判还未采取积极的态度，遂使这几个重要问题还不能立即实现，还有待于继续努力。
    雷任民着重指出，发展国与国之间的贸易往来，对于促进各国和平经济的繁荣发展，改善人民生活，增进各国的友好关系，促进世界各国的和平共处，都是有积极作用的，也是符合世界各国人民的愿望和利益的。我们主张撤除人为的障碍，打开中日两国之间的贸易。但是中日两国间的贸易却仍然受到不应有的限制，这种不正常的情况，我们认为应该改善，我们希望能够改善。中国人民愿为改善中日两国贸易关系，为中日两国人民的友好合作，为中日两国关系的正常化同日本人民一起共同努力。我们相信，只要日本政府采取具体有效的措施，对新的贸易协定给予实际的支持，撤除人为的障碍和限制，就可以改善中日贸易关系，并扩大中日贸易。
    雷任民又说，我们在访问日本期间，看到日本人民对于中日两国友好、中日两国关系正常化和贸易关系正常化的热烈愿望，代表团到处受到日本人民和各界人士的热烈欢迎，许多场面确实是非常动人的。这都表现了中日两国人民的深切友谊，这种友谊不是任何人为的阻挠和限制所能隔断的。
    中华全国总工会书记处书记李颉伯在讲话中说：中国工人阶级和各国工人阶级一样，积极支持世界和平大会的号召，并愿与世界各国工人阶级共同为促使裁减军备和禁止使用原子武器而斗争。李颉伯说，中国工人阶级热烈同情和支持日本人民禁止原子弹、氢弹的斗争。中国工人阶级热烈支持禁止原子弹、氢弹世界大会，预祝大会的圆满成功。
    李颉伯说，我们对于这次以中华全国总工会副主席刘宁一为首的中国代表团，由于日本政府只发部分签证因而未能全部及时地前往日本参加广岛大会，表示非常遗憾。李颉伯接着说：但我们愿意告诉日本人民，日本人民反对原子战争与反对原子武器的斗争，都将得到中国工人阶级和中国人民的热烈支持。
    英国和平委员会会长普里特在会上发言时，对直接遭受原子灾害的千百万日本人民表示深切的同情。普里特说：但同情是不够的，我们必须努力使这种罪行不再发生。我相信，在日本、在中国、在亚洲和在其他的大陆上，和平力量已强大到足以宣布原子武器和氢武器的非法。舆论的力量在今天已强大到足以创造一种新的气氛，使原子武器和氢武器的使用成为不可能。但和平力量一刻也不能放松警惕，我相信，假若他们保持他们的警惕并明智地运用这种伟大的力量，他们就能最后挫败原子弹和氢弹战争的威胁，并且为争取和平取得更大的胜利。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会副秘书长龟田东伍在会上讲话。他说，作为曾经遭受原子弹、氢弹惨重灾难的日本国民的一分子，我对今天的会议表示深切感谢。龟田东伍说，核子武器虽然有空前的破坏力，但是我们坚决相信：爱好和平的人民的团结和建设的力量，是比任何破坏力都要强大得多的，和平一定战胜战争。龟田东伍又说，我们和亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿的人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民一起悼念在广岛、长崎和比基尼罹难的人们。我们誓必进行斗争，绝不允许使用原子弹和氢弹的事件重演，并坚决为普遍裁减军备、发展和平利用原子能而努力。
    接着，全体到会者一致通过首都各界人民反对原子战争与反对使用原子武器大会的决议。在决议通过后，会场响起热烈的掌声。
