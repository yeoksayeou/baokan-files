Watching the Performance of the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe
	Hu Guogang, Deputy Head of the Song and Dance Troupe of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

	In the spring of 1952, some members of the Chinese Youth Art Troupe visited Albania. We brought the friendship of the Chinese people to the Albanian people and were warmly and cordially received by the Albanian people. To this day, those days full of friendship and joy spent in Albania remain deeply in our hearts.

	This time, the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe has come to Beijing from distant Tirana. We, the art workers who once visited Albania, have another opportunity to see the Albanian people's song and dance art with rich national characteristics, and we feel particularly cordial. We welcome the artistic envoys of the Albanian people with the feelings of welcoming old friends and acquaintances, and pay cordial comradely respect to these close comrades-in-arms who have come from afar.

	I watched the premiere performance of the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe in Beijing with excitement. The Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe's choir sang powerfully, fully demonstrating the heroic and unyielding national character of the Albanian people. Under the direction of art director Gacho Avrazi, the choir sang hymns praising the motherland and national heroes. Every singer and musician in the choir devoted all their energy to the performance, so that the content of the songs was powerfully expressed. When we heard the majestic and powerful "First Division March" and "Hymn to Glory," we were unconsciously brought into the atmosphere of fighting heroism expressed in the songs. During the intermission, I heard the enthusiastic praise of the surrounding audience: This is "a real army choir"!

	The song and dance troupe's solo performances were also very wonderful. The soloists successfully sang Albanian folk songs, classical opera selections, as well as Soviet and Chinese songs with unique styles, using high artistic skills. Soprano Maria Kraja sang "You Are So Small and Lovely" and "You Walk Like a Bird Flying." Her lyrical singing profoundly and vividly depicted the sincere love between Albanian young men and women. Albanian National Conservatory of Music actor Stavri Rafael, and two winners of the World Youth Festival International Competition, Avni Mulia and John Atanas, sang classical songs, especially Chinese songs such as "Singing the Erlang Mountain," "In That Distant Place," and "We Workers Have Strength," which were warmly welcomed by the audience. From their singing, we can appreciate the Albanian people's profound understanding and cordial friendship towards the Chinese people.

	The folk dances performed by the song and dance troupe are also full of distinct national characteristics, leaving a fresh and deep impression on the audience. These beautiful and healthy dances fully demonstrate the Albanian people's bold and enthusiastic character and their love for their motherland, for freedom, and for life. In the "South Albanian Suite," we saw the gentle and lyrical steps of the young girls; while the movements of the strong young men were powerful and humorous. When they danced together, they showed such joy and such enthusiasm that they brought the audience into an atmosphere of freedom and happiness. The "Mogitka Tribe Suite" is accompanied by cheerful and powerful drum sounds, reflecting the beauty of youth. Beautiful girls and young lads dance happily; when the two naughty lads, with humorous expressions, take light steps and try to peek at the veiled bride, the audience can't help but laugh for them. The "Zirjan Suite" fully expresses the heroic and simple character of the people in the Zirjan mountainous area of northeastern Albania, their yearning for and love for a happy life, through bold and enthusiastic dance movements. In the "Tirana Suite," the dancers hold small copper pieces and strike out crisp sounds with their dance steps, showing distinct national characteristics.

	Thank you to the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe for the precious artistic gifts they have brought. Their visit and performance will enhance the understanding and friendship between our two peoples; their fighting artistic practice is a model for our troops' art workers to learn from.

　　看阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团的演出
　　中国人民解放军歌舞团副团长　胡果刚
    一九五二年春天，中国青年文艺工作团的部分团员，曾经访问过阿尔巴尼亚。我们把中国人民的友谊带给了阿尔巴尼亚人民，也受到了阿尔巴尼亚人民的热情的亲切的接待。至今，在阿尔巴尼亚度过的那些充满着友谊和欢乐的日子，还深深地留在我们的心里。
    这次，阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团从遥远的地拉那来到北京，我们，曾经访问过阿尔巴尼亚的文艺工作者，又有机会看到阿尔巴尼亚人民的富有民族特色的歌舞艺术，倍感亲切。我们以欢迎故旧知交的心情欢迎阿尔巴尼亚人民的艺术使节，并向这些远道而来的亲密的战友致以亲切的同志的敬意。
    我怀着兴奋的心情看了阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团在北京的首次演出。阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团合唱队的演唱，雄浑有力，充分表现了阿尔巴尼亚人民英勇不屈的民族性格。合唱队在艺术指导加乔·阿夫拉齐的指挥下，演唱了歌颂祖国、歌颂民族英雄的赞歌。合唱队的每一个歌手和乐手，在表演时都倾注了自己的全部精力，使得歌曲的内容，得到了有力的表现。当我们听到雄壮有力的“第一师进行曲”和“光荣颂”的时候，我们不自觉地被带到歌曲所表现的那种战斗的豪迈的气氛中。在休息的时候，我听到了周围观众的热情的赞叹：这是“真正的军队的合唱队”！
    歌舞团的独唱节目，也是非常精彩的。独唱家们运用高度的艺术技巧，成功地演唱了具有独特风格的阿尔巴尼亚民歌、古典歌剧选曲，以及苏联和中国歌曲。女高音歌唱家玛丽亚·克拉亚演唱了“你是多么娇小而可爱啊”和“你走起路来好像小鸟飞翔”。她的富有抒情意味的歌声，把阿尔巴尼亚青年男女间的真挚的爱情，深刻而生动地描绘了出来。阿尔巴尼亚国立音乐院演员斯塔夫里·拉斐尔，两位世界青年联欢节国际竞赛获奖者阿夫尼·穆利亚和约翰·阿达纳斯独唱的古典歌曲，特别是中国歌曲“歌唱二郎山”、“在那遥远的地方”、“咱们工人有力量”等，受到了观众的热烈欢迎。我们从他们的演唱中，可以体会到阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民的深刻的了解和亲切的友情。
    歌舞团演出的民间舞蹈，同样富有鲜明的民族特色，给观众留下了新鲜的、深刻的印象。这些美丽而健康的舞蹈，充分地显示了阿尔巴尼亚人民的豪放、热情的性格和他们对祖国、对自由、对生活的热爱。在“南阿尔巴尼亚组舞”中，我们看到了年青姑娘们的柔美的抒情的步伐；而健壮的青年们的动作则是有力的、富有风趣的。他们在一起合舞时，表现了那样的欢乐，那样的热情，把观众也带到自由、幸福的气氛中了。“莫吉特卡族组舞”是以欢快有力的鼓声来伴奏的，它反映了青春的美好。美丽的姑娘和年青的小伙子愉快地舞蹈着；当那两个调皮的小伙子带着诙谐的表情，踏着轻轻的步子，想偷看一下带着面纱的新娘时，观众禁不住为他们而欢笑了。“兹尔江组舞”通过豪迈、热情的舞蹈动作，把阿尔巴尼亚东北部兹尔江山区人民的英勇纯朴的性格，他们对幸福生活的向往和热爱，充分地表现了出来。在“地拉那组舞”中，舞蹈者手执小铜片，伴着舞步敲出清脆的音响，显示了鲜明的民族特色。
    感谢阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团带来的艺术上的珍贵礼品。他们的访问演出，将增进我们两国人民间的了解与友谊；他们的战斗的艺术实践，是我们部队文艺工作者学习的榜样。
