Combining the Patriotic Health Campaign with Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control
　　Wang Qingyuan
    Schistosomiasis, a disease with high morbidity and great harm, is prevalent in the Yangtze River basin and its southern regions in our country. To fundamentally control the epidemic of schistosomiasis and gradually eliminate it, in addition to some specific issues that need to be studied and resolved by specialized institutions and experts, all measures for the prevention and control of schistosomiasis should be incorporated into the Patriotic Health Campaign plan and used as a regular key task of the Patriotic Health Campaign. This is a new direction for carrying out the Patriotic Health Campaign in schistosomiasis epidemic areas.

    In the past few years, some schistosomiasis epidemic areas have included schistosomiasis prevention and control as one of the contents of the Patriotic Health Campaign, and organized and mobilized the masses to do some preventive work; however, there are many shortcomings in the work, namely: lack of a clear policy, lack of strong leadership, and close cooperation between relevant departments. At the same time, the prevention and control work in some areas focused on treatment and failed to actively mobilize the masses for prevention. In addition, because many preventive measures contradict the production and living habits of the masses, some health workers and schistosomiasis prevention and control personnel still lack confidence in combining the Patriotic Health Campaign with schistosomiasis prevention and control. More areas, so far, have not realized that schistosomiasis prevention and control is a mass work, and regard this major task as only a matter for professional prevention and control institutions, which is difficult to relate to the Patriotic Health Campaign, or the connection is not large. Therefore, the Patriotic Health Campaign in these areas is still stuck in generally calling for the elimination of mosquitoes, flies, rats, fleas, and prevention of gastrointestinal infectious diseases, and has no connection with or little connection with the prevention and control of schistosomiasis, the most harmful disease in the local area. As a result, the Patriotic Health Campaign in these areas is not carried out well, and the schistosomiasis prevention and control work is also done poorly.

    The epidemic factors of schistosomiasis are quite complex, but the fundamental measures for schistosomiasis prevention and control are to organize, mobilize and educate the masses in epidemic areas to actively improve environmental sanitation and pay attention to personal hygiene. This work should be carried out in conjunction with the Patriotic Health Campaign.

    Doing a good job in fecal management is an effective measure to improve environmental sanitation, eliminate gastrointestinal infectious diseases and schistosomiasis, and other parasitic diseases. To do this work well, it is necessary to first publicize health knowledge to the masses, educate the masses not to defecate everywhere, and not to wash toilets and manure tools in rivers and canals; educate boatmen and fishermen not to defecate and dump manure in the river; and strengthen the management of livestock manure as much as possible to avoid polluting water sources. Secondly, in light of the actual situation in the epidemic area, mobilize the masses to adopt various methods to strengthen fecal management. For example, add sufficient urine to fresh manure, crush and mix it, cover and seal it for three days (summer) to seven days (winter) before use. This can kill schistosomiasis eggs with the ammonia decomposed from urea and prevent the breeding of fly pupae, and prevent the large amount of nitrogen fertilizer from playing out and preserve the value of the fertilizer. In areas where dry manure is habitually used for fertilization, composting and fermentation can be promoted, which can also kill insect eggs and prevent gastrointestinal infectious diseases. This work cannot be done alone by professional prevention and control institutions, but must rely on mass health campaigns.

    Since the launch of the Patriotic Health Campaign, various places have called on the masses to eliminate flies, mosquitoes, rats, dig pupae, etc. according to different seasons and different situations. These practices are undoubtedly applicable in schistosomiasis epidemic areas, but in addition to this, the masses should also be mobilized to carry out snail elimination campaigns. Oncomelania hupensis is the only intermediate host of schistosomiasis, and there will be no epidemic of schistosomiasis without the existence of Oncomelania hupensis. Oncomelania hupensis grows in places where the water flow is slow and weeds are overgrown. During the busy farming season, women and children can be organized to capture them under protected conditions, or health personnel can be organized to apply drugs to kill snails in key areas; in the late winter season, the masses can be mobilized to burn weeds along the banks of rivers, lakes, ditches, and canals, or to kill Oncomelania hupensis by pouring boiling water. In addition, in conjunction with water conservancy construction, improve environmental sanitation, remove weeds on the river bank, dredge ditches, accelerate water flow, and fill in abandoned ditches and depressions to deprive Oncomelania hupensis of breeding conditions. According to the experience of Zhejiang, Jiangsu and other places, the effect of killing snails by soil burial in spring and winter in conjunction with water conservancy construction is very good. Therefore, schistosomiasis epidemic areas should pay attention to this work when carrying out the winter and spring Patriotic Health Campaign, and teach the masses some specific methods to do this work well. For example, for larger irrigation canals, the water should be drained first, and then the masses should be mobilized to dig a deep ditch along the riverbed and the junction of the bank slope, and then shovel the soil layer with Oncomelania hupensis on both sides of the ditch and bury it in the deep ditch, and then cover it with three to five inches of clean soil and tamp it. After a few months, all the Oncomelania hupensis buried in the soil can die. Small irrigation canals can bury the soil layer with Oncomelania hupensis in the deep ditch dug on the bank and tamp it with clean soil. Oncomelania hupensis in the field ditches can be buried in the soil in autumn in conjunction with the renovation of the field ridges.

    Unclean drinking water is the root cause of general gastrointestinal diseases and parasitic diseases, and it is also the main link in the transmission of schistosomiasis. In schistosomiasis epidemic areas, in conjunction with the prevention and control of general gastrointestinal infectious diseases and parasitic diseases, it is necessary to advocate drinking well water, organize and mobilize the masses to dig more wells, and protect the wells from fecal pollution. If river water must be used, the masses should be educated to heat it to a scalding level (drinking must be boiled) or disinfect it with bleaching powder before use to prevent schistosomiasis cercariae from drilling into the skin. At the same time, it is also necessary to publicize the importance of personal prevention to the masses, and educate the masses not to swim or bathe in the river. Even when fishing or cutting grass, they should try to minimize contact with river water and lake water, or use protective equipment, such as wearing double-layer cloth socks and tung oil cloth socks, to prevent schistosomiasis infection.

    While carrying out the above-mentioned preventive work, the Patriotic Health Campaign Committee should actively cooperate with the schistosomiasis prevention and control committees at all levels to organize health and medical institutions and private practitioners at all levels to go deep into the countryside for treatment, and mobilize the masses to assist.

    In-depth publicity and education and extensive mobilization of the masses are the keys to doing a good job in schistosomiasis prevention and control. The Patriotic Health Campaign Committees at all levels in schistosomiasis epidemic areas should attach great importance to and do this work well. While conducting general health knowledge publicity, they should make the masses aware of the harm, transmission process, and prevention and control methods of schistosomiasis, and mobilize the masses to conscientiously implement various prevention and control measures. Schistosomiasis prevention and control is an arduous mass work, and it is also an urgent requirement of every mass in the epidemic area. As long as the Patriotic Health Campaign Committees at all levels in the epidemic area can actively cooperate with the prevention and control committee, repeatedly and patiently carry out publicity and education work to the masses, so that the masses can master the technology of preventing schistosomiasis, and combine science and technology with the power of the masses, it is not difficult to eliminate schistosomiasis. Therefore, it is necessary to be good at mobilizing the masses and organizing the masses, through mass organizations such as fishery trade unions, farmers' associations, and agricultural production cooperatives, and adopt methods of reward and commendation to improve the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses in preventive work, and establish practical and feasible health covenants on the basis of the masses' conscious and voluntary, so that preventive measures can be smoothly implemented under the mutual supervision of the vast masses.

    The Patriotic Health Campaign, which includes the main content of schistosomiasis prevention and control, must also be combined with production in schistosomiasis epidemic areas. The Patriotic Health Campaign Committees at all levels should arrange work according to the agricultural production season.

    The mass agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement is booming in the vast countryside. The prevention and control work of agricultural production cooperatives must first be done well with emphasis, and at the same time, the organization of individual farmers and fishermen for prevention and control should not be relaxed. In state-owned factories, mines and enterprises and construction sites in schistosomiasis epidemic areas, more attention should be paid to combining the Patriotic Health Campaign with schistosomiasis prevention and control.

    Since the prevention and control of schistosomiasis involves improving agricultural fertilizer accumulation, farming methods, water conservancy construction, and changing the inherent living habits of the masses, the Patriotic Health Campaign Committees at all levels must organize and mobilize relevant departments to cooperate with each other and work together in carrying out prevention and control work. When carrying out water conservancy projects in the epidemic area, the water conservancy department should listen to the opinions of the health department, so that the project can also eliminate Oncomelania hupensis, and take measures to prevent migrant workers from being infected with schistosomiasis. The agricultural department should promote reasonable fertilizer storage and application methods according to the requirements of schistosomiasis prevention and control. Propaganda, education, public security, transportation and other departments, as well as mass organizations such as trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and the Democratic Women's Federation, should provide strong assistance in mobilizing the implementation of various prevention and control measures.

    In recent years, the Patriotic Health Campaign has greatly improved the health knowledge level of the working people and promoted the health of the people. The broad masses have personally experienced the benefits of paying attention to hygiene, which has laid a solid foundation for carrying out mass health work in the future. The Patriotic Health Campaign Committees at all levels in schistosomiasis epidemic areas should actively cooperate with the schistosomiasis prevention and control committees at all levels under the unified leadership of the Party and the government, organize and mobilize the masses in the epidemic area to fight for the elimination of schistosomiasis.

　　结合爱国卫生运动防治血吸虫病
　　王清源
    在我国长江流域及其以南地区，流行着患病率很高、危害性很大的血吸虫病。要从根本上控制血吸虫病的流行，逐步消灭血吸虫病，除了一些专门问题须要由专门机构和专家研究解决外，还应当将防治血吸虫病的一切措施纳入爱国卫生运动计划，并作为爱国卫生运动经常性的重点工作，这是在血吸虫病流行区开展爱国卫生运动的新的方向。
    过去几年中，有的血吸虫病流行地区曾经把防治血吸虫病作为爱国卫生运动的内容之一，组织和动员群众做了些预防工作；但工作中的缺点是很多的，这就是：缺乏明确的方针，缺乏有力的领导，各有关部门的配合也不密切，同时，有些地区的防治工作偏重治疗，未能积极动员群众进行预防。另外，由于许多预防措施同群众的生产和生活习惯有着矛盾，一部分卫生工作干部和血吸虫病防治人员对结合开展爱国卫生运动，防治血吸虫病还缺乏信心。更多的地区，到目前为止还没有认识到防治血吸虫病是一个群众性的工作，而把这一重大任务看作只是专业防治机构的事情，同爱国卫生运动难以发生联系，有联系也不大；因此，这些地区的爱国卫生运动仍停留在一般地号召消灭蚊、蝇、鼠、蚤和预防肠胃传染病等工作上，而跟防治当地危害性最大的血吸虫病工作没有联系起来或联系不多。结果，这些地区的爱国卫生运动开展得很不好，血吸虫病的防治工作也做得很差。
    血吸虫病的流行因素相当复杂，但防治血吸虫病的根本措施是组织、动员和教育流行区群众积极改善环境卫生，注重个人卫生。这项工作是应同爱国卫生运动结合起来进行的。
    作好粪便管理工作是改善环境卫生，杜绝胃肠传染病和血吸虫病以及其它寄生虫病的有效措施。要作好这项工作，首先须要向群众进行卫生知识的宣传，教育群众不要随地大便，不要在河渠洗刷马桶和粪具；教育船民渔民不要在河里大便和倾倒粪便；尽可能加强牲畜粪便的管理，以免污染水源。其次，应当结合流行区的实际情况，动员群众采用各种办法，加强粪便管理。如把新粪加上足量的小便经捣碎混合后，加盖加封荫存三天（夏季）至七天（冬季）而后使用，这样既能使尿素分解出的氨杀死血吸虫卵和防止蝇蛹的繁殖，又能防止氮肥的大量发挥，保存了肥料的价值。在习惯用干粪肥田的地方，可推行堆肥发酵的办法，这同样可以杀死虫卵和预防胃肠传染病。这一工作，不可能由专业防治机构单独进行，必须依靠群众性的卫生运动。
    开展爱国卫生运动以来，各地曾根据不同季节不同情况，号召群众灭蝇、灭蚊、灭鼠、挖蛹等等，这些作法在血吸虫病流行地区无疑也是适用的，但除此以外，还应当发动群众开展灭螺运动。钉螺是血吸虫唯一的中间宿主，没有钉螺的存在就不会有血吸虫病的流行。钉螺生长在水流缓慢和杂草丛生的地方，在农忙季节，可以组织妇女、儿童在有防护的条件下加以捕捉，或组织卫生人员在重点地区施用药物灭螺；在残冬季节可以发动群众在河、湖、沟、渠沿岸用火烧杂草的办法，或用浇开水的办法，杀灭钉螺。另外，可以结合兴修水利，改善环境卫生，铲除河边杂草，疏通沟渠，加速水流，填平废沟渠和洼地，使钉螺失去孳生条件。根据浙江、江苏等地的经验，在春冬季结合兴修水利发动群众用土埋法灭螺的效果很好。因此血吸虫病流行区在开展冬春季爱国卫生运动时，应当重视这一工作，并教给群众一些具体办法，把这一工作作好。如较大的灌溉渠应先把水放干，而后发动群众沿河床和岸坡交界处挖一条深沟，再将沟两侧生有钉螺的土层铲下埋入深沟中，然后盖上三至五寸厚的净土，打实，几个月后，埋入土中的钉螺可全部死亡。小的灌溉渠可把带有钉螺的土层埋在岸上挖好的深沟里，用净土打实。田沟里的钉螺可在秋后结合翻修田埂进行土埋。
    饮用水不清洁是传染一般胃肠病、寄生虫病的根源，也是传染血吸虫病的主要环节。在血吸虫病流行区应当结合防治一般胃肠传染病、寄生虫病，提倡饮用井水，组织和动员群众多打水井，并保护水井不受粪便污染。如非用河水不可，应教育群众必须加热至烫手程度（饮用必须煮沸）或加漂白粉消毒后再使用，以防血吸虫尾蚴钻入皮肤。同时还应当向群众宣传个人预防的重要性，教育群众不要下河游泳洗澡。即或在捕鱼、割草时也应设法尽量少跟河水、湖水接触，或用防护用具，如穿带双层布袜和桐油布袜等，以防感染血吸虫病。
    在开展以上预防工作的同时，爱国卫生运动委员会应当积极配合各级血吸虫病防治委员会，组织各级卫生医疗机构、开业医师深入农村进行治疗，并发动群众予以协助。
    深入地进行宣传教育和广泛发动群众是搞好血吸虫病防治工作的关键。血吸虫病流行区各级爱国卫生运动委员会应切实重视和作好这一工作，在进行一般卫生知识宣传同时，应当使群众认识血吸虫病的危害性、传染过程和防治办法，发动群众认真贯彻各项防治措施。防治血吸虫病是一项艰巨的、群众性的工作，同时又是流行区每个群众的迫切要求，只要流行区各级爱国卫生运动委员会能积极配合防治委员会，反复地、耐心地向群众进行宣传教育工作，让群众掌握预防血吸虫病的技术，使科学技术跟群众力量结合起来，血吸虫病的扑灭是不困难的。因此，必须善于发动群众和组织群众，通过群众性的组织如渔业工会、农民协会、农业生产合作社等，采用奖励和表扬的方法，提高群众对预防工作的积极性和创造性，并在群众自觉自愿的基础上订立切实可行的卫生公约，使预防措施在广大群众互相监督下顺利贯彻。
    在血吸虫病流行区开展包含防治血吸虫病这一主要内容的爱国卫生运动，同样也必须结合生产来进行。各级爱国卫生运动委员会应当根据农业生产季节布置工作。
    广大农村正蓬勃开展农业互助合作运动，必须首先有重点地搞好农业生产合作社的防治工作，同时也不放松组织个体农民和渔民进行防治工作。在有血吸虫病流行区的国营厂矿企业和工程工地，更应当重视结合爱国卫生运动防治血吸虫病。
    由于血吸虫病的防治工作涉及改善农业积肥，耕作方式，兴修水利和改变群众固有的生活习惯等，因此在进行防治工作时各级爱国卫生运动委员会必须组织和动员有关部门互相配合，共同努力。在流行区兴修水利工程时，水利部门便应当听取卫生部门的意见，使工程兼收消灭钉螺的效果，并采取措施防止民工感染血吸虫病。农业部门应当根据防治血吸虫病的要求推行合理的储肥和施肥的方法，宣传、教育、公安、交通等部门以及工会、青年团、民主妇女联合会等群众团体，应在动员贯彻各项防治措施方面予以大力协助。
    几年来爱国卫生运动大大提高了劳动人民的卫生知识水平，增进了人民的健康，广大群众已亲身体验到讲究卫生的好处，为今后开展群众性的卫生工作打下了坚实的基础。血吸虫病流行区的各级爱国卫生运动委员会，应当在党和政府的统一领导下，积极配合各级血吸虫病防治委员会，组织和动员流行区群众为消灭血吸虫病而奋斗。
