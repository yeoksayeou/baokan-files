Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 17th. TASS reported: The Secretariat of the World Peace Council issued a statement on the 16th regarding the preliminary results of collecting signatures for the World Peace Council's appeal to the people of the world against atomic war. The statement said that as of August 6, the number of people who had signed the appeal to the people of the world had reached 655,963,811. This is 173 million more than the number of people who signed the Stockholm Appeal. In the past, a total of 482,482,199 people signed the Stockholm Appeal. A total of 612,522,504 people signed the appeal to the people of all countries to strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty.

The statement listed the number of signatures in some countries on the appeal to the people of the world to illustrate the rising public sentiment. In Japan, 32.26 million people signed, accounting for one-third of Japan's total population. In Syria, there were 609,000 people, accounting for one-sixth of Syria's total population. In Italy, there were more than 12 million people. In Indonesia, there were 2.5 million people, while in the past, the number of people who signed the Stockholm Appeal was 200,000.

The statement said that the signature campaign is still ongoing. In Japan, China, the Soviet Union, and the People's Democracies, the signature campaign has practically ended, while in the vast majority of other countries, the signature campaign is still being carried out enthusiastically, including France, Italy, India, Brazil, Argentina, and other countries. In these countries, tens of millions of signatures may still be collected. More than one million signatures have already been collected in Paris. In São Paulo, the second largest city in Latin America, almost all residents of many districts have signed the appeal to the people of the world.

While the World Peace Council's signature campaign is being carried out, public movements have prompted famous scientists and major organizations to advocate for the destruction of nuclear weapons. These include trade unions, cooperative alliances, and churches (including the Methodist and Evangelical churches in the United States).

The statement said that the World Peace Movement believes that the will of the people must be specifically expressed through the collection of signatures. As long as we continue and strengthen this movement, we can accelerate the arrival of the day when atomic weapons are banned and destroyed, ensure the relaxation of international tensions, promote the resolution of the issues to be discussed at the Foreign Ministers' Conference in October this year, and seek improvement in the situation in Asia.

    世界和平理事会书记处初步宣布
    六亿五千万人签名反对原子战争
    新华社十七日讯　据塔斯社维也纳讯：世界和平理事会书记处在十六日发表了关于为世界和平理事会反对原子战争的告全世界人民书征集签名的初步结果的声明。声明说，截至八月六日，在告全世界人民书上签名的人数已达六亿五千五百九十六万三千八百一十一人。这比在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的人数多一亿七千三百万人。过去在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的共有四亿八千二百四十八万二千一百九十九人。在争取缔结和平公约的告世界各国人民书上签名的共有六亿一千二百五十二万二千五百零四人。
    声明中列举了一些国家在告全世界人民书上签名人数来说明公众的高涨情绪。在日本签名人数有三千二百二十六万人，占日本全国人口的三分之一。在叙利亚有六十万九千人，占叙利亚全国人口的六分之一。在意大利有一千二百余万人。在印度尼西亚有二百五十万人，过去在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的人数是二十万人。
    声明说，征集签名运动还在继续进行。在日本、中国、苏联和人民民主国家中签名运动实际上已经结束了，而在其他绝大多数国家中，征集签名运动还在热烈地开展着，其中包括法国、意大利、印度、巴西、阿根廷等国。在这些国家里还可能征集到成千万个签名。在巴黎已经征集到一百多万签名。在拉丁美洲的第二大城市圣保罗，许多区的居民几乎全体都在告全世界人民书上签了名。
    在世界和平理事会征集签名运动开展的同时，公众的运动促使著名的科学家和各大团体都主张销毁核子武器。其中有英国和美国的工会、合作社联盟和教会（包括美国的美以美教和福音教教会）。
    声明说，世界和平运动认为，必须通过征集签名的方式具体表现人民的意志。我们只要继续并加强这种运动，就能使禁止和销毁原子武器的日子加速到来，保证国际紧张局势的缓和，促使今年十月间的外长会议上将要讨论的问题得到解决，并且求得亚洲局势的改善。
