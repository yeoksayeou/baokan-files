    Why is the Construction and Installation Quality at the First Automobile Factory Site So Poor?
    Yong Feng
    The construction and installation quality at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant site has been generally poor in all work areas this year. In terms of civil engineering, from January to mid-June this year, a total of 419 quality incidents occurred. In the plant area, for industrial pipelines, all sanitary engineering pipelines, and ventilation and lighting installation projects (excluding mechanical and electrical, and power installations), a total of 1,645 quality incidents, large and small, occurred from January to June this year, and the number is increasing month by month. Among the more serious quality incidents, for example, in the 102nd work area of the Construction Engineering Department's directly affiliated engineering company, the omission of rebar during rebar tying occurred as many as 17 times in the short span of 33 days from April 23rd to May 26th, with some individual projects missing dozens or even hundreds of rebars. In the 106th work area, the concrete columns in the southern span of the framework almost all had pitted surfaces, honeycombing, and voids, and the column foundations had already settled. In the 104th work area's backfilling project, 13,000 cubic meters of frozen soil were used for backfilling. In the 108th work area's electroplating department's basement, most of the rebars in the four walls and columns were exposed. The unloading pit built by the 107th work area leaked water as soon as it was completed, and it still leaked after rework and repair. The central avenue built by the 110th work area used grass mats as backfill to a depth of half a meter, resulting in settlement everywhere.
    Why do such serious quality incidents occur?
    First, because the civil engineering and installation quality of most work areas was very good last year and was praised by Soviet experts, the leaders of these work areas developed a sense of pride and complacency. They believed that last year's projects were complex and the workload was large, but this year's workload is not larger or more complex than last year's, and since the quality was very good last year, there would be no problems this year. Some leaders of work areas said: "We overcame great rivers and seas last year, what are we afraid of this year?" Therefore, they managed construction with a nonchalant, bureaucratic attitude; at the same time, they were unwilling to accept the opinions of others and humbly learn from the advanced experiences of others. For example, when the 106th work area was building the framework, the engineer from the 107th work area, who had built framework projects last year, personally went to the 106th work area to introduce the experience of pouring the framework, but the 106th work area did not humbly accept it, resulting in pitted surfaces, honeycombing, and voids in the poured framework. Some work areas not only did not accept the experience of others, but also did not make good use of their own experience. For example, the basement project built by the 108th work area last year was of good quality and had some experience, but this year's basement project was not built according to last year's method, so the quality was far worse than last year's.
    Second, the education of "a century-long plan, quality first" was not repeatedly carried out among the masses, and the mass self-inspection system was not established. The work area foremen and construction management section leaders believed that establishing a self-inspection system for the working masses was too troublesome, and the masses regarded ensuring quality as solely the responsibility of the technical supervision department, so they were unwilling to do self-inspection work. They believed: "I did it myself, and I have to inspect it myself, what can I find?" If the quality of a project is poor and is discovered by the technical supervision department, it will be reworked, and if the technical supervision department does not discover it, it will be considered done. Sometimes, when the technical supervision department finds poor quality and raises objections, it is met with abuse, and even some work area directors wrongly support the opinions of workers and foremen who produce poor quality work and are unwilling to rework it.
    Third, simply paying attention to economic indicators and blindly rushing progress is also an important reason for quality incidents. The situation in most work areas is: the plan is not completed in the first half of the month, but there are fewer quality incidents; in the second half of the month, due to rushing progress, there are particularly many quality incidents. The worse the task completion in the first half of the month, the more quality incidents there are in the second half of the month. For example, in order to rush progress, the 109th work area backfilled soil before the paint on the industrial pipeline pipes was dry and some of the pipe joints were not even painted, ostensibly completing the progress indicators, but in reality, rework would be required next month. In the 108th work area, when lifting column projects, the base of the column foundation was not cleaned before grouting, resulting in the columns being skewed. In particular, earthwork projects, due to failure to follow operating procedures, none of the backfilling projects did not experience settlement. Fourth, preparation work before construction was not done well. For example, before construction, the construction organization design was not done well, the construction drawings were not studied well, the quality standards and operating procedures were not well understood, and the technical personnel did not give detailed technical explanations to the workers, so the workers were clueless. For example, the No. 5 road's upper water channel and the gas station's sewer in the 109th work area were started without a construction organization design, making it impossible to guarantee quality. Do the leaders responsible for civil engineering and installation at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant site know about these serious quality incidents and the reasons for these serious quality incidents? Of course, they do, but they rarely conduct serious inspections and strict handling of any quality incident, whether it is a technical quality incident or a political quality incident, and mostly just criticize it verbally. In particular, the leaders of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant site have completely abandoned their leadership responsibility for the technical supervision department. Many opinions raised by the technical supervision department regarding quality incidents have not been given good support, preventing the technical supervision department from playing its due role. All of these objectively contribute to the occurrence and development of quality incidents. Based on the above situation, the leading staff of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant site must strengthen the leadership of the technical supervision department, organize forces, conduct a serious quality inspection, clarify the causes of the incidents, strictly investigate responsibility, and use these materials to conduct repeated education among the masses, and establish a strict self-inspection system; the technical supervision department should also strengthen the usual inspection work. In addition, the material inspection station should strengthen the inspection of raw materials and prefabricated products to ensure the production of qualified products. Only in this way can the quality of the project be effectively guaranteed from top to bottom and from bottom to top, avoiding the losses caused to the country due to poor quality.

    第一汽车厂工地建筑安装质量为什么低劣
    永锋
    第一汽车制造厂工地今年各工区建筑安装质量普遍低劣。土建方面，从今年一月到六月中旬，共发生质量事故四百一十九件；厂区工业管道、所有卫生工程管道和通风照明等安装工程（机电、动力安装在外），从今年一至六月，共发生大小质量事故一千六百四十五件，而且逐月都在增加。其中质量事故较严重的，如建筑工程部直属工程公司一○二工区绑钢筋时漏筋事故，从四月二十三日到五月二十六日短短的三十三天中就达十七起之多，有的一个单位工程漏筋竟达数十根至数百根。一○六工区的南面跨度的框架的混凝土柱子，几乎都有麻面蜂窝和狗洞，柱子基础已下沉。一○四工区的回填土工程，有一万三千立方公尺都是冻土回填的。一○八工区电镀工部的地下室四面墙和柱子大部分钢筋都露在外面。一○七工区卸煤坑刚修好就漏水，进行返工修理后还是漏水。一一○工区修的中央大道，将草垫子作回填土填下去有半公尺深，结果所有的回填土没有一个地方不下沉的。
    为什么会发生这样严重的质量事故呢？
    首先、由于去年大部分工区的土建安装工程质量都很好，曾得到苏联专家的好评，这些工区的领导人员就产生了骄傲自满情绪。他们认为去年工程复杂，工程量也大，今年工程量不比去年大，也不比去年复杂，去年质量很好，今年更不会有问题。有些工区的领导人员说：去年大江大海都过来了，今年还怕什么。因此就以满不在乎的官僚主义态度来管理施工；同时也不愿接受别人的意见和虚心学习别人的先进经验。如一○六工区作框架时，去年作过框架工程的一○七工区的工程师亲自到一○六工区去介绍浇灌框架的经验，但一○六工区并未虚心接受，因而浇出的框架都有麻面蜂窝和狗洞。有的工区不仅不接受别人的经验，就是自己的经验也没有很好地运用。如一○八工区去年作的地下室工程质量是良好的，有一些经验，但是今年作的地下室工程就没有按照去年的办法做，因此质量远不如去年的好。
    其次、没有在群众中反复地进行“百年大计、质量第一”的教育，没有将群众性的自检制度建立起来。工区工长和施工管理科领导人员认为劳动群众建立自检制度太麻烦，群众把搞好质量看成只是技术监督处的责任，因此也不愿意作自检工作，他们认为：我自己作的，还要我自己来检查，能检查出什么来。有的工程质量不好，如果被技术监督处检查出来了，就返工，如果技术监督处没有检查出来就算了。有时技术监督处发现质量不好，提出意见，竟遭到谩骂，甚至有的工区主任竟错误地支持质量不好又不愿返工的工人和工长的意见。
    第三、单纯注意经济指标，一味抢进度，也是造成质量事故的重要原因之一。大部分工区的情况是：每月上中旬完不成计划，但质量事故比较少；下旬由于抢进度，质量事故就特别多。上中旬完成任务越差，下旬质量事故也就越多。如一○九工区为了抢进度，工业管道管子刷油未干，管子接头部分有的还没有刷着油，就进行回填土，表面上像是完成了进度指标，实际是下月还得返工。一○八工区起吊柱子工程，还没有将柱子基础的胚子清理好，就灌浆，结果柱子发生偏歪。特别是土方工程，由于不按操作规程进行施工，回填土工程没有一处不发生下沉的。第四、施工前准备工作没有作好。如施工前，没作好施工组织设计，没很好学习施工图纸，没很好了解质量标准和操作规程，技术人员也没有详细地向工人作技术交代，因此工人心中无数。如一○九工区的五号路上水道，煤气站的下水道等，都是没有施工组织设计就开始施工的，无法保证质量。以上这些严重的质量事故和造成这些严重质量事故的原因，第一汽车制造厂工地负责土建安装的领导人员是否知道呢？当然是知道的，但是他们对任何质量事故，不管它是技术性质量事故，还是政治性质量事故，很少进行认真的检查和严格的处理，大都是口头上批评批评就算了。特别是第一汽车制造厂工地的领导人员对技术监督处竟完全放弃了领导责任。技术监督处提出许多有关质量事故的意见，也没有给予很好的支持，致使技术监督处不能发挥应有的作用。这些，都在客观上助长了质量事故的发生和发展。根据以上的情况，第一汽车制造厂工地的领导工作人员必须加强对技术监督处的领导，组织力量，认真地进行一次质量检查，将发生事故的原因搞清楚，严格追究责任，并用这些材料在群众中进行反复的教育，建立严格的自检制度；技术监督处也要加强平时的检查工作。另外还要加强材料检查站对原材料、预制品的检查工作，保证合格产品出产。只有这样，才能自上而下，自下而上有效地保证工程质量，避免因质量低劣给国家造成的损失。
