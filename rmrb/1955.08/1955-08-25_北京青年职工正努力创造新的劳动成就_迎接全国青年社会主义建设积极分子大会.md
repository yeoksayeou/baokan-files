Xinhua News Agency, August 24th dispatch: Beijing's young workers are striving to improve labor efficiency and comprehensively fulfill and over fulfill national plans with new achievements to welcome the convening of the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference.

　　The Zhang Baifa Steel Bar Workers Youth Shock Brigade, a model team in the Beijing construction industry, accepted a new task on the 19th. The shock brigade held a team meeting and decided to break through the quota by 30 percent as a gift to the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference. Since the establishment of this shock brigade in April last year, it has continuously broken quotas, and Zhang Baifa was selected as a representative to attend the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference.团支部General meetings of the Communist Youth League were held in various workshops of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, calling on young workers to greet the convening of the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference with new labor achievements. The factory's Red Flag newspaper, blackboard bulletin, and honor roll all publish the production achievements of young activists, and the radio station broadcasts the production news of young workers every day. Zhang Jinming, a Beijing labor model and young worker at this factory, actively studied the methods of Zhuang Minggeng, a recipient of the "Glorious Railway Worker" medal, to reduce auxiliary working hours and carry out production in an orderly manner, and adopted Kolesov turning tools and high-speed cutting methods, which greatly improved production efficiency. By August 10th, he had completed the annual production task ahead of schedule. Now he has formulated a plan to complete another six months' worth of tasks before the end of the year. Ti Baotian, who was selected to attend the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference from this factory, had utilized 20 tons of waste materials by the 20th, saving the country 1,000 yuan. At the Beijing No. 2 Machine Tool Factory, labor competitions were launched between youth classes and groups. They set the key issues of the general lack of technical proficiency among young workers and the high rate of defective products as conditions for the competition. Wu Zhenhua, a Beijing industrial labor model and the leader of the first maintenance team of the Beijing Automobile Transportation Company, and his team, in order to welcome the convening of the conference, proposed that each person should save one or two liang of cotton thread per day, and each repair of a car should save a quarter of a gallon of gasoline. They have achieved this goal since the 15th. They also created a hand-operated black oil adding machine, ensuring that 1,000 gallons of black oil will be saved by the end of the year.

　　Many young workers have made plans to strive to become young production activists. According to statistics from 17 factories and mining enterprises, more than 7,500 young production activists have emerged.

　　北京青年职工正努力创造新的劳动成就
  　迎接全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会
    据新华社二十四日讯　北京市青年职工，正以提高劳动效率，以及全面完成和超额完成国家计划的新成就，迎接全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的召开。
    北京市建筑业模范小组、张百发钢筋工青年突击队在十九日接受了一项新的任务，突击队召开了队会，决定要突破定额百分之三十作为向全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的献礼。这个突击队从去年四月建队起，连续突破定额，张百发被选拔为出席全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的代表。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂各个车间都召开了团支部大会，号召青年职工以新的劳动成就，迎接全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的召开。厂里的红旗报、黑板报、光荣榜上都登载着青年积极分子的生产成绩，广播站每日播送着青年工人的生产捷报。这个厂的北京市劳动模范、青年工人张金铭，积极学习“光荣的铁路工作者”奖章获得者庄铭耕减少辅助工时、有秩序地进行生产的方法和采用科列索夫车刀、快速切削法，大大提高了生产效率。到八月十日，他已提前完成了全年生产任务。现在他又制定了计划，准备在年底前再完成相当六个月的任务。这个厂被选拔出席全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的遆宝田，到二十日止，又利用废料二十吨，为国家节约一千元。在北京第二机床厂，青年班、组之间展开了劳动竞赛。他们把青年工人普遍存在的技术不熟练，废品率高的关键问题订为竞赛的条件。北京市工业劳动模范、北京市汽车运输公司第一保养组组长吴振华和他的小组为了迎接大会的召开，提出每人每天要节约一两棉丝，每修一部汽车要节约四分之一加仑汽油。他们从十五日起已达到了这个奋斗目标。他们还创造了手摇加黑油机，保证到年底节约黑油一千加仑。
    许多青年职工订出了计划，争取做一个青年生产积极分子。据十七个厂矿企业的统计，目前已涌现出七千五百多名青年生产积极分子。
