Editor's Note: The American imperialist spy organization "44th Overseas Observation Team" was uncovered by us during the Korean War (July 1951). Although this incident happened several years ago, it still has important significance for our current struggle. It exposed that some comrades (such as the director of the Factory Affairs Department of the Northeast Railway Bureau) were politically extremely negligent and adopted an extremely serious laissez-faire attitude towards state secrets; it also exposed that our personnel system had extremely serious loopholes, especially the phenomenon that responsible cadres casually introduce relatives and friends to work without thorough review is very dangerous. In this struggle to thoroughly eliminate hidden counter-revolutionary elements, we must completely eliminate all similar serious phenomena.

I. An Honored Guest in the Minister's Home

    The incident occurred in the early days of the Korean War.

    One Sunday, at the home of the director of the Factory Affairs Department of the Northeast Railway Bureau in Harbin, the family was discussing the Korean War after dinner. Yu Baolian, the director's brother-in-law and an employee of the Northeast Railway Bureau, was also sitting with everyone.

    "I heard that the American air force is very powerful. If they come to air raid, what can we do to defend ourselves?" Yu Baolian asked the director. Yu Baolian had been visiting his brother-in-law's home more frequently recently and often asked him questions about the prospects of the war. He was obviously very concerned about the current situation.

    "What's there to be afraid of? There's nothing to be afraid of at all," the director replied without thinking. "Now we have the latest jet aircraft, which has a speed of ×××× kilometers per hour. In the future, we can win in the air, so there's no need to fear air raids. Our airports all have highly sensitive detection equipment that can detect enemy planes even when they are ×××× kilometers away. Especially ×× airport, which has very good equipment. With this equipment, our planes can take off and meet the enemy before their planes even arrive. What's there to be afraid of?"

    "Now we have ×××× train cars of supplies going to support the Chinese People's Volunteers every day. During the Anti-Japanese War, we defeated the Japanese devils under such difficult material conditions. Today, peace-loving people are strongly supporting Korea with such abundant supplies, so why should we be afraid of defeating the American devils?" the director said enthusiastically.

    This director carelessly leaked extremely important state military secrets, and that frequent visitor to his home, his brother-in-law Yu Baolian, was actually an American imperialist spy! But this director's offense was not limited to this. He brought some confidential documents issued by the Party home and left them lying around. Yu Baolian took the opportunity to steal them and obtained even more intelligence. And wasn't Yu Baolian able to worm his way into the people's railway organization because of this director's negligence? This director and Yu Baolian were classmates since childhood, and later they both went to university in Beijing and joined the Chinese National Liberation Vanguard under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. When the Anti-Japanese War broke out, the two lost contact. The director joined the Eighth Route Army. During the same period, Yu Baolian first worked as a lecturer at a university in Beijing, but later ran to Tianjin to become a traitor. He served as secretary, section chief, general affairs director, and even secretary director of the "Tianjin Anti-Communist Committee." After liberation, in 1950, he went to Beijing for a meeting, and the two reunited after a long separation. Yu Baolian concealed his ugly history and asked the director to find him a job, which the director readily agreed to. Thus, his brother-in-law, the American spy Yu Baolian, was introduced by him to work in a department of the Northeast Railway Bureau as a clerk. It just so happened that Yu Baolian's job required him to travel along the railway to various places to understand the situation and collect materials, which was very beneficial to his espionage activities! With an open identity and the ability to travel around, he was extremely convenient in collecting a lot of intelligence, especially after the American imperialist invasion of Korea broke out. According to the instructions of the American spy agency, Yu Baolian's activities of spying on intelligence became even more intensified. A large amount of extremely important intelligence, including the gathering places of certain units of the Chinese People's Volunteers, unit numbers, equipment, number of personnel, commanders, locations of logistics bases, location of our air force bases, airport facilities, militia conditions, etc., were all collected by him during his business trips. And sometimes, this intelligence would be sent to Tokyo and Seoul within two days and placed on the desks of the generals of the American invading army.

II. In Physics Laboratory 127A

    In the evening, as the lights came on, the Jishilin Cafe in Beijing was full of guests, laughing and talking.

    In the corner booth on the southwest corner, two people were sitting face to face, one was a woman in her thirties dressed in finery, and the other was a well-mannered man in a neat cadre uniform. They were talking pleasantly in low voices, and the woman was smiling and glancing around while talking.

    Unbeknownst to people, the man took a small folded piece of paper from under the cups and saucers on the table and quickly put it in his coat pocket.

    An intelligence transfer between American spies Li Minhui and Wang Junwen was completed.

    Late that night, inside the former Fu Jen Catholic University on Dingfu Street in Beijing, everyone was asleep, and the quiet campus was silent. In the darkness, someone was sneaking around on campus. He was walking on tiptoes, listening carefully for any sounds around him. He walked to the door of the underground laboratory 127A of the Physics Department, and with extreme caution, he slowly opened the door with a key, gently entered the laboratory, and then locked the door again.

    American spy and former lecturer of the Physics Department of Fu Jen Catholic University, Wang Junwen, sneaked into his dedicated laboratory. He immediately took out an American-made spy transceiver from the instrument cabinet. This transceiver was issued by the American intelligence agency. To cover it up, Wang Junwen mixed it in with the school's radio communication equipment and pasted a school instrument label on it. Wang Junwen took out the transceiver and placed it on the table, immediately plugged in the power plug, put on the headphones, and began to send a call signal with his index finger pressing the telegraph key: L·E·H, L·E·H, … Two minutes later, the reply from the American intelligence agency's radio station came, and Wang Junwen began to send the message. The content of the message was: "?The CCP Air Force now has jet aircraft with a speed of ×××× kilometers per hour. …××× number of aircraft are stationed at Northeast … Airport. ?Northeast airports are equipped with ×××× equipment, which can detect enemy aircraft within ×××× kilometers. ×× Airport has the best efficiency. ?The CCP transports … supplies totaling ×××× train cars to Korea every day. This intelligence was collected by Yu Ping (Note: Yu Baolian's spy code name), sent by Jack Wang, 1950·November·3." After sending the message, he began to receive a message. The content of the message was: "?Quickly investigate and report the location of important railway factories in Northeast China, noting the latitude and longitude and nearby locations for bombing purposes. ?Work in Northeast China needs to be strengthened urgently. Is it possible to establish an organization in Changchun? If so, please proceed actively and allocate a radio station to them to strive for communication with Hong Kong in the New Year. ?The intelligence you have reported in the past three months is very valuable. In addition to the annual funding of 12,000 US dollars, an additional bonus of 2,700 US dollars is awarded, which can be collected in Hong Kong at any time."

    After receiving the message, Wang Junwen put the radio back in the instrument cabinet and then returned to his room to sleep.

    The next day, when Wang Junwen appeared in front of people, he was again a young teacher who was "ideologically progressive," "actively working," "sincere to others," and "modest in attitude." Lecturer Wang Junwen, Master of Physics, has always used disguised progress to conceal his espionage activities. He taught "earnestly" and was very "concerned" about the students' learning. He "actively" studied Marxist-Leninist theory. When studying political economy, he exclaimed: "This analysis is so incisive and the principles are so correct!" Because the school's Youth League organization lacked strict and conscientious review of him, they were deceived by Wang Junwen and regarded him as a progressive teacher. In late 1950, just as Wang Junwen's espionage activities were intensifying with the American imperialist military adventures in Korea, Wang Junwen was actually admitted to the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and became a League member (before infiltrating the Youth League, he had even requested instructions from the American intelligence agency through a secret radio and received "approval"). After that, Wang Junwen's espionage activities became even more rampant. The number of communications with the American intelligence agency increased, and more important intelligence was reported to the American imperialist intelligence agency more quickly.

III. Both Ends of a Line

    How were these few vile souls of Wang Junwen, Yu Baolian, and Li Minhui connected? Where does this black line lead?

    Wang Junwen, Yu Baolian, and Li Minhui belonged to a latent spy group of American imperialism. The group consisted of five spies: the group leader Cong Kezhong, who also served as a translator and was a veteran American spy, code-named Madison. He had been acting as an American spy since the Anti-Japanese War. On the surface, he was a "medicinal chemist" and taught at Shenyang Medical College before liberation. The radio operator was Wang Junwen, and the intelligence officers were Yu Baolian and Chen Zuhan. Chen Zuhan's public occupation was "Western medicine merchant," living on Xinkai Road, Dongdan, Beijing, specializing in traveling to various parts of Northeast China to "do business." During this "business" travel, he spied on intelligence and brought Yu Baolian's intelligence to Beijing for transmission. The transportation liaison officer was Li Minhui, Chen Zuhan's wife, who appeared to be a frivolous housewife. Before the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, in order to strengthen espionage activities, Cong Kezhong left Beijing for Hong Kong and engaged in training spies and sending them to the mainland in large numbers under the instructions of the American intelligence agency. Before leaving, Cong Kezhong summoned Chen Zuhan, Li Minhui, and Wang Junwen to take a boat on Kunming Lake in the Summer Palace for a secret talk to study the espionage work after his departure. According to Cong Kezhong's arrangement, after his departure, Chen Zuhan succeeded him as the leader of the latent group, also serving as an intelligence officer and translator.

    The other end of the black line was in Hong Kong, that is, the Hong Kong office of the American imperialist overseas espionage and sabotage organization – "External Survey Detachment 44." From Hong Kong, the black line connected to the "GHQ Building" in Tokyo, Japan; from Tokyo, the black line connected to the city on the banks of the Potomac River across the Pacific Ocean – Washington, which was the end of the black line.

    Every activity of the latent spy group was closely linked to Washington's aggressive policy. The American plot to launch a war of aggression against Korea and then to invade our country had been premeditated for a long time, which was clearly reflected in the activities of the latent spy group. The spy group was located in Beijing. As early as 1949, the American intelligence agency in Hong Kong instructed the spy group to do everything possible to spy on military, political, and economic intelligence about Northeast China. In April 1950, two months before the outbreak of the Korean War, when spy Chen Zuhan went to Hong Kong for the third time to report on his work and collect espionage funds and telegraph codes, Lieutenant Colonel Ronald Metz, a veteran American spy who directly commanded this spy group, further instructed Chen Zuhan to develop "underground armed forces" in Northeast China to prepare for "military activities behind enemy lines." After Chen Zuhan sneaked back to the mainland, he actively sought out reactionary elements who had served as officers in the Kuomintang army, preparing to recruit them into the spy organization and organize "underground armed forces." After the outbreak of the Korean War, the activities of the spy group reached their peak. The American intelligence agency not only instructed the spy group to use all means to step up spying on various intelligence in Northeast China, especially military intelligence, but also repeatedly asked the spy group to establish a spy organization in Changchun to communicate with the American intelligence agency in Hong Kong and further expand espionage and sabotage activities to coordinate with the American imperialist military operations in Korea.

    In June 1951, after Chen Zuhan went to Hong Kong for the fifth time to contact the American intelligence agency and meet with Metz, Metz emphatically told him: "Go back to the mainland and work hard, and completely focus your work on the Korean war." Before being transferred to the Okinawa intelligence agency, Metz again instructed Chen Zuhan: "We must strengthen contact in the future. In order to make each communication smoother, your broadcasts will be jointly received by Hong Kong, Okinawa, and Tokyo, so that each communication will be accurate."

    However, not long after, the day of the people punishing Chen Zuhan and other treacherous and heinous special agent spies arrived.

IV. Unable to Escape the Law

    One afternoon in late July 1951, a special express train from Beijing to Changchun whistled sharply and entered Tangshan Station of the Jing-Shan Railway. Among the crowds of passengers coming and going, four public security officers in yellow uniforms hurried towards a soft-berth carriage. They divided into two groups and boarded the carriage from both ends.

    Almost at the same moment, they walked up to a passenger wearing a silk shirt who was constantly waving a fan.

    "Raise your hands! You are now under arrest!" the public security officer said sharply, while showing an arrest warrant.

    "What, what, what's going on?" The passenger stood up obediently and raised both hands. The public security officers searched his whole body. While searching, the passenger looked at the pistols in the hands of the public security officers and said cunningly: "Comrades: I'm afraid there is some misunderstanding, you should..."

    "Shut up! You know why you are being arrested!" the public security officer sternly shouted at him.

    This passenger was Chen Zuhan.

    On the same day, American spy Yu Baolian was arrested in Shenyang, and Wang Junwen and Li Minhui were captured in Beijing.

    These few evil bandits even attempted to deny their crimes in the preliminary trial court.

    However, when the conclusive evidence: two radio stations, more than a dozen codebooks, secret writing drugs, secret writing paper, a large amount of espionage funds, etc., were presented, these few spies had no choice but to plead guilty.

    No counter-revolutionary criminal can escape the punishment of the people. In October 1954, the Military Control Commission Military Court of Beijing Municipality sentenced the four special agent spies of this latent spy organization to death in accordance with the law, ending their sinful lives.

    坚决、彻底、干净、全部地肃清一切反革命分子
    我们不能忘记这件事
　　易家祥
　　编者按：美帝国主义的间谍组织“第四十四海外观测队”是在抗美援朝战争时期（一九五一年七月）被我们破获的。这件事虽然隔了几年，但对于我们现在的斗争仍然有重要的意义。这里暴露出有些同志（如东北铁路总局厂务部部长等）政治上极端麻痹，对于国家的机密采取了极端严重的自由主义态度；同时也暴露出我们的人事制度有极严重的漏洞，特别是负责干部随意介绍亲友、同学参加工作而不经周密审查的现象是十分危险的。在这次肃清暗藏的反革命分子的斗争中，必须彻底消灭一切类似的严重现象。
　　一、部长家里的座上客
    事情发生在抗美援朝战争的初期。
    一个星期日，在哈尔滨市东北铁路总局厂务部部长的家里，晚饭后，一家人在谈论着朝鲜战争。部长的姐夫、东北铁路总局的职员于葆廉也和大家坐在一起。
    “听说美国的空军很厉害，如果他们来空袭，我们可有什么办法防御吗？”于葆廉向部长问道。于葆廉近来到他的内弟家特别勤了，并且时常向他的内弟提出一些关于战争前途的问题。他显然十分关心当前的局势。
    “怕什么，一点也不用怕。”部长听了于葆廉的话，不假思索地回答说：“现在我们已经有了最新式的喷气式飞机，这种飞机的时速是××××公里。今后空军方面可以制胜，空袭不必怕。我们各地机场都有高度灵敏的探测设备，敌人的飞机还在××××公里以外就可以探知了。特别是××机场，设备很好，有了这种设备，敌人的飞机还没有到临，我们的飞机就可以起飞迎击，这有什么可怕的？”
    “现在我们每天都有××××节车皮的物资去支援中国人民志愿军。抗日战争时期，我们在那么困难的物质条件下还打败了日本鬼子，今天爱好和平的人民大力支援朝鲜，物资这样雄厚，还怕打不胜美国鬼子么？”部长热烈地说。
    这位部长毫无警惕地泄漏了国家的极为重要的军事机密，而他家近来的那位常客、他的姐夫于葆廉却正是美帝国主义的一个间谍！但这位部长的罪过不是仅此而已，他把党内发的一些机要文件带到家里随便乱放，于葆廉乘机偷看了，就又获得了更多的情报。而于葆廉所以能够钻进人民铁路机构中来，不也是因为这位部长的麻痹大意么？这位部长和于葆廉从小是同学，后来又同到北京上大学，先后参加了中国共产党领导的中华民族解放先锋队。抗日战争爆发，两人的联系断绝了。部长参加了八路军。而于葆廉在同一时期，先是在北京某大学当讲师，后来却跑到天津当汉奸去了。他当过“天津市剿共委员会”的秘书、科长、总务处长以至秘书处长。解放后，一九五○年到北京开会，两人久别重逢。于葆廉隐瞒了他丑恶的历史，要这位部长给找个工作，这位部长慨然应诺。于是他的这位姐夫、美国间谍于葆廉就经他介绍到东北铁路总局某部充任科员。正好于葆廉的职务需要时常沿铁路到各地去了解情况、搜集材料，这对他的间谍活动太有利了！既有公开的身份，又能各地走动，利用这个条件，他极其方便地搜集了许多情报，特别是当美帝国主义侵朝战争爆发后，按照美国间谍机关的指示，于葆廉的刺探情报的活动就更其加紧了。大量的极重要的情报，包括中国人民志愿军某些部队的集结地点，部队番号、装备、人数、指挥人员，后勤基地所在和我国的空军基地所在、机场设施、民兵状况等等，都被他在出差到各地时搜集了去。而这些情报，有时候，不过两天就送达东京和汉城，摆到了美国侵略军将军们的案头。
      二、在物理实验室127A里
    傍晚，华灯初上的时候，北京的吉士林咖啡馆里宾客满座，笑语喧哗。
    在西南角上的那个厢座里，面对面地坐着两个人，一个是盛装的三十几岁的女人，另一个是穿着整洁的干部制服的文质彬彬的男子，两人在愉快地轻声谈着话，那女人在谈话时，微笑着而且两眼四面流盻。
    在人们不知不觉的时候，那男子从桌上的杯碟下边取出一张折得很小的纸条，迅速地放进上衣口袋里。
    美国间谍李敏慧和王浚文之间的一次情报传递完成了。
    当天深夜，北京定阜大街前辅仁大学内，人们都已熟睡了，幽暗的校园内一片寂静。黑暗中有一个人在校园内鬼鬼祟祟地穿行。他踮着脚走着，一边注意听着四外有没有响动，他走到物理系地下实验室127A门前，极度小心地用钥匙缓慢地打开了门，轻轻地走进实验室，随即又把门锁上。
    美国间谍、前辅仁大学物理系讲师王浚文溜进了他的专用实验室，立刻从仪器橱内取出一部美式特工收发报机，这部收发报机是美国特务机关发给的，为了掩人耳目，王浚文把它混在学校的无线电讯仪器里，并在上边贴上了学校仪器的标签。王浚文取出收发报机放到桌上，马上插上电插肖，戴上耳机，用食指按着电键开始拍发呼叫讯号：L·E·H，L·E·H，……两分钟以后，美国间谍机关电台的回答来了，王浚文于是开始发报。发报的内容是：“?中共空军现已有时速××××公里之喷气式飞机、东北……机场停有×××架左右。?东北各机场皆有××××设备，可探知××××公里内之敌方飞机，以××机场者效率最佳。?中共每日均有……物资共××××车皮运韩。本次情报搜集人于平（笔者注：即于葆廉的间谍代号），发报人杰克·王，一九五○·十一·三。”发报完毕，又开始收报。收报的内容是：“?速探报东北境内重要铁路机厂位置，以经纬度及附近地点注明，以便遣机轰炸。?东北工作亟需加强，长春有无建立组织之可能？如有，请即积极进行，由你组拨给电台一部，争取新年与港通报。?三近三月来你台所报情报均极有价值，兹决定除本年度经费一万二千美元外，另发奖金二千七百美元，可随时来港领取。”
    收完报以后，王浚文又把电台放到仪器橱里，然后回到他的住室睡觉。
    第二天，当王浚文出现在人们面前的时候，他又是一个“思想进步”、“工作积极”、“待人诚恳”、“态度谦和”的青年教师。讲师、物理学硕士王浚文一向是以伪装进步来掩饰他的特务活动的。他教书“认真”，对同学们的学习很“关心”。他“积极”学习马克思列宁主义理论。在学习政治经济学的时候，他赞叹地说：“这分析多么精辟，道理多么正确呀！”学校团组织由于对他缺乏严格认真的审查，他们被王浚文骗过了，把他当成了进步教师，而在一九五○年年底，正当王浚文的间谍活动随着美帝国主义在朝鲜的军事冒险而加紧的时候，王浚文竟被吸收加入了中国新民主主义青年团，成了团友（在混进青年团以前，他还曾通过秘密电台向美国间谍机关请示过，得到了“批准”）。此后，王浚文的间谍活动更加猖狂起来，同美国间谍机关通报的次数增加了，更多的重要情报更迅速地报给了美帝国主义间谍机关。
      三、一根线的两端
    王浚文、于葆廉、李敏慧这几个卑劣的灵魂是怎样勾联起来的？这根黑线通向何处去？
    王浚文、于葆廉、李敏慧同属于美帝国主义的一个潜伏间谍组，这个组共有间谍五人：组长丛克中，自兼译电员，是老牌美国间谍，特工代号麦迪逊（Madison）。远在抗日战争时期，他就充当美国间谍。从外表上看，他是个“药物化学家”，解放前曾在沈阳医学院教书。报务员是王浚文，情报员是于葆廉和陈祖汉。陈祖汉的公开职业是“西药行商”，家住北京东单新开路，专跑东北各地“作生意”。在这种“作生意”的旅行中，他刺探情报，并且把于葆廉的情报带到北京拍发。交通联络员李敏慧，是陈祖汉的妻子，外表上是一个浮华的家庭妇女。一九五○年朝鲜战争爆发前，为了加强间谍活动，丛克中离开北京到香港，在美国间谍机关指示下从事训练间谍、往大陆大量派遣的工作。丛克中临走前，曾召集陈祖汉、李敏慧、王浚文到颐和园昆明湖上泛舟密谈，研究他走后的间谍工作问题。依照丛克中的布置，他走后由陈祖汉继任了潜伏组组长，兼任情报员、译电员。
    黑线的另一端在香港，那就是美帝国主义的海外间谍破坏活动机构——“第四十四海外观测队”（External　Survey　Detachment44）的驻港机关。从香港，黑线联到日本东京的“盟总大楼”；从东京，黑线联到太平洋彼岸玻多玛克河畔的城市——华盛顿，那就是黑线的尽头。
    潜伏间谍组的每一项活动，都是同华盛顿的侵略政策紧密结合的。美国发动侵略朝鲜战争并进而侵略我国的阴谋原是蓄谋已久，这在潜伏间谍组的活动中有着鲜明的反映。间谍组设在北京，早在一九四九年，香港的美国间谍机关就指令间谍组要全力刺探关于东北的军事、政治、经济的情报。一九五○年四月，距离朝鲜战争爆发还有两个月，间谍陈祖汉第三次到香港汇报工作并领取间谍经费和电报密码时，直接指挥这个间谍组的老牌美国间谍罗纳德·麦兹中校（Lt．Col．Ronald　Metz），更指示陈祖汉在东北发展“地下武装”，准备进行“敌后军事活动”。陈祖汉潜返大陆后，就积极物色曾任国民党军官的反动分子，准备把他们收罗到间谍组织中，筹组“地下武装”。朝鲜战争爆发后，间谍组的活动达到了顶点。美国间谍机关不仅指令间谍组利用一切手段，加紧刺探东北的各项情报，首先是军事情报，而且屡次要求间谍组在长春建立间谍组织，同香港美国间谍机关通报，进一步扩大进行间谍破坏活动，以配合美帝国主义在朝鲜的军事行动。
    一九五一年六月，间谍陈祖汉第五次到香港和美国间谍机关联系、会见麦兹后，麦兹曾强调地告诉他：“回大陆去要好好工作，把工作重心完全放在韩国战事上。”麦兹在被调到冲绳间谍机关前，又叮嘱陈祖汉说：“今后要加强联系。为使每次通报都更为顺利，你们发报均由香港、冲绳、东京三地共同收听，这样当可使每次通报都准确无误。”
    然而，不久以后，人民惩办陈祖汉等几个背叛祖国、罪该万死的特务间谍的日子到来了。
      四、难逃法网
    一九五一年七月下旬的一天下午，从北京开往长春方面的一次特快列车鸣着尖锐的汽笛驶进了京山铁路的唐山车站。在来来往往的旅客群中，有四个穿着黄色制服的公安人员急促地走向一节软席客车。他们分为两人一组，从客车的两头登车进入了车箱。
    几乎是在同一时刻，他们走到一个身穿绸衫正在不停地挥着扇子的旅客的面前。
    “举起手来！现在你已经被捕了！”公安人员厉声说，同时出示了逮捕证。
    “怎么，怎么，怎么回事呀？”那旅客遵从地站了起来，举起两手。公安人员搜查了他的全身。搜查的时候，那旅客看看公安人员手中的手枪，狡诈地说道：“同志：这恐怕是出于什么误会吧，你们应当……”
    “住口！为什么逮捕你，你自己知道！”公安人员严厉地喝住他。
    这个旅客就是陈祖汉。
    同一天，美国间谍于葆廉在沈阳被捕，王浚文、李敏慧在北京就擒。
    这几个万恶的匪徒，甚至在预审法庭上，还企图狡赖自己的罪行。
    但是，当确凿的罪证：两部电台、十几本电码、密写药物、密写纸、大量间谍活动经费等等被提出来的时候，这几个间谍不得不低头认罪了。
    没有一个反革命罪犯能够逃过人民的制裁。一九五四年十月，北京市军事管制委员会军法处依法判处了这个潜伏间谍组织的四名特务间谍以死刑，结束了他们的罪恶的生命。
