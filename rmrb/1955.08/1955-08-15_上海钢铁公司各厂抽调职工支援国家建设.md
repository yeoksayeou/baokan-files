Shanghai Steel Company Factories Transfer Employees to Support National Construction

The various factories under the Shanghai Steel Company have rationally adjusted their labor organization and transferred nearly a thousand employees. Most of these employees are urgently needed for national construction, including section chiefs, engineers, technicians, workers of various trades, doctors, and nurses. They are now concentrating on studying the first Five-Year Plan and other related topics, awaiting national allocation.

In the reorganization work, the factories under the Shanghai Steel Company, based on the nature and workload of their work, have respectively merged and abolished many functional groups of sections, offices, and workshops, and some production workshops. Preliminary streamlining has also been carried out for some bloated organizations. The Shanghai No. 1 Steel Factory, a joint state-private enterprise whose products are all purchased by the state and whose main raw materials are also supplied by the state, originally had eight functional groups under its supply and marketing section, making things take several detours. After the reorganization, four groups were abolished, and twenty staff members were reduced, making things much faster. In the past, the state-owned Asia Steel Factory divided smelting and sand casting into two workshops. When the quality of the castings was not good, the two sides blamed each other. Now, they have been merged into one workshop, reducing nearly 30% of the personnel, and production problems can also be jointly studied and resolved.

After the reorganization, the phenomenon of auxiliary workers wasting time in various factories has also been greatly improved. The Asia Steel Factory originally had ten electrical wiring workers. Sometimes they had nothing to do, and when there was something to do, one person would carry a ladder, one would carry wires, one would carry a light bulb, and others would come empty-handed, all rushing to the scene. Now, five of these ten electrical wiring workers have been transferred out. They are auxiliary workers in this factory, but they will be main trade workers after they go to the power industry system.

    上海钢铁公司各厂抽调职工支援国家建设
    上海钢铁公司所属各厂合理调整劳动组织，调出了近一千名职工。这些职工大部分是国家建设急需的科长、工程师、技师、各工种的工人和医生、护士等。现在他们正集中进行关于国家第一个五年计划等学习，听候国家调配。
    上海钢铁公司所属各厂在整编工作中，根据工作性质和工作量的情况，分别合并和撤销了许多科、室、车间的职能组，和一部分生产车间，对于一些臃肿的组织，也初步地进行了紧缩。产品全部由国家收购、主要原材料也由国家供给的公私合营上海第一钢厂，原来的供销科下面设立了八个职能组，一件事要转好几个弯；整编后撤销了四个组，减少了二十个工作人员，办起事来快了许多。国营亚细亚钢铁厂冶炼和翻砂过去分成两个车间，铸件的质量不好时，双方相互责难；现在，合并成一个车间，减少了近百分之三十的人员，生产上的问题也能够共同研究解决。
    整编后，各厂辅助工人窝工的现象，也有很大改善。亚细亚钢铁厂原有十名电气线路工人，他们有时无事可做，有事时就一人扛梯子、一人拿电线、一人拿灯泡、另一些人空起手来，一齐赶去。现在，这十名电气线路工人中有五人被抽调出来了。他们在这个厂是辅助工种工人，到电业系统后将是主要工种的工人。（新华社）
