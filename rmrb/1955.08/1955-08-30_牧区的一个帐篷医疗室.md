　　A Tent Clinic in a Pastoral Area
　　Yan Shugui
    In early July, a cluster of five tents appeared on Songmutan, a mountain in the southern pastoral area of Sunan Yugur Autonomous County, Gansu Province. This was the tent clinic of the second team of the Gansu Provincial National Medical and Disease Prevention Team.
    In the past, medical personnel from the National Medical and Disease Prevention Team provided medical care to herdsmen on a mobile basis. They would stay in one place for a few days and then move to another, which made it difficult to treat chronic diseases. Therefore, it was decided to select some suitable locations to fix the locations of the medical and disease prevention teams. The tent clinic in Songmutan is one of them. When this news spread to the herdsmen's tribes, they were very happy. As soon as the medical staff arrived, they came to help, cleaning the place, moving things, and setting up tents. Some people also sent firewood, milk, mutton, and vegetables to welcome the medical staff who came to work in the pastoral area.
    There are seven medical staff working in Songmutan. Like comrades working on other fronts, they have come up with many ways to overcome the difficulties facing them. Without a desk for office work, they turned the medicine box over, supported it with branches, and used it as a table; without a bed in the clinic, they laid a carpet on the ground as a bed; without firewood for cooking, they went to the mountains to pick it up in their spare time, and without water for cooking, they carried it from the river themselves; if they could not get vegetables, they asked people to buy some pickles from the city. Once it was time for work, everyone threw themselves into tense and serious labor. After work, the medical staff would take time to visit nearby herdsmen, asking them what their reactions were after treatment? How was the effect? What opinions did they have on the medical staff? Then, based on the results of the visits, they improved their work. Some time ago, the herdsmen were busy shearing wool and did not have time to seek medical attention, so the medical staff went to the herdsmen's tents to treat them.
    Many herdsmen with minor illnesses have quickly recovered their health due to timely treatment; the symptoms of some chronic disease patients have also begun to alleviate with continuous treatment.

　　牧区的一个帐篷医疗室
　　燕树桂
    在甘肃省肃南裕固族自治县南部牧区的一个山头——松木坛，七月上旬出现了一簇五个帐篷。这就是甘肃省民族医防队第二队的帐篷医疗室。
    民族医防队的医务人员，过去给牧民看病是流动性的。他们在一个地方住一些日子，又重新搬到另一个地方，这样治疗慢性病有很多困难。因此就决定选择一些适中的地方，把医防队的地点固定下来。松木坛的帐篷医疗室便是其中之一。当这件事传到牧民部落里的时候，牧民们非常高兴。医务人员刚一到，他们便来帮忙，打扫地方，搬东西，搭帐篷。有些人还送来木柴、牛奶、羊肉和青菜，欢迎来到牧区工作的医务人员。
    在松木坛工作的医务人员有七个人，他们同在别的战线上工作的同志一样，想出许多办法克服摆在自己面前的困难。办公没有写字台，便把药箱翻过来，用树枝支上，当桌子用；诊疗室没有病床，就在地上铺上地毯，作为病床；烧饭没有木柴，工余时间就到山里去捡，煮饭没有水，自己到河里担；吃不到青菜，就托人到城里买一些咸菜来。一到工作时间，大家都投入紧张而严肃的劳动中。工作过后，医务人员有时间便访问附近的牧民，问他们在治疗后有什么反应？效果如何？对医务人员有什么意见？然后根据访问结果改进自己的工作。前些时候，牧民正在忙着剪羊毛，没有时间来就诊，医务人员就分别到牧民的帐篷里给牧民治病。
    附近许多患轻微病症的牧民由于得到及时的治疗，很快地恢复了健康；一些慢性病患者得到不断治疗，症状也在开始减轻。
