    朝鲜中立国监察委员会函军事停战委员会
    要求对南朝鲜当局的干涉行动采取步骤
    新华社平壤十一日电　朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：由于李承晚集团最近为了企图破坏朝鲜停战协定而在南朝鲜制造一系列严重情势，中立国监察委员会在八月十日举行了第二百零八次会议。
    会议在真诚地研究了上述问题后，在波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞典和瑞士四国委员的一致同意下，通过了致军事停战委员会的一封信。
    在当天发出的这封信中说，中立国监察委员会已收到韩国外务部长官在一九五五年八月五日发出的要求中立国监察委员会代表至迟在一九五五年八月十三日二十四时以前撤出韩国领土的通知。
    信中指出韩国政府在它的通知中曾声明韩国政府对于不遵照上述要求的中立国监察委员会人员可能遭到的任何事故不负责任，信中还指出危害中立国视察小组人员的安全和妨害他们执行职务的一系列的行动已经在韩国领土上的各口岸发生。
    信中强调这种事态引起了同中立国监察委员会关系极大的紧急状态，它又说，中立国监察委员会声明，按照停战协定赋予的任务的履行将不会因为外来的任何干涉而受到影响。
    这封信说，具体来说，根据规定中立国监察委员会的权力的朝鲜停战协定第二条丙、第三十六款、四十一款和五十款，一九五五年八月十日举行的第二百零八次会议已决定将上述通知交给军事停战委员会加以紧急考虑和采取适当步骤，这是由于考虑到中立国监察委员会无权处理通知中提到的这种要求。
    中立国监察委员会的波兰委员莫尔斯基公使、捷克斯洛伐克委员陶什将军、瑞典委员马林将军和瑞士委员斯图基公使都在信上签了名。
