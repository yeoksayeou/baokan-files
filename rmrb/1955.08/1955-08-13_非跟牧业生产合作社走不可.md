    “Must Follow the Path of the Livestock Production Cooperative”
    Saiyin
    In May of this year, I went to the Huheletai Livestock Production Cooperative in Inner Mongolia. For the first few days, I always thought Menghe was also a member of the cooperative because he spoke to me very kindly, just like the other members, and he knew a lot about the cooperative's affairs. Later, I found out that he was a solo farmer.
    It turned out that, since the autumn of 1954, Menghe had become a regular visitor to the cooperative. His family followed the cooperative closely, moving from the winter camp to the spring camp. Menghe and his son-in-law, Saiyinga, went to the cooperative almost every day, helping the cooperative pull grass, patrol at night, and do odd jobs. The members of the cooperative also didn't treat them like outsiders. When he lacked livestock or food, the cooperative lent it to him, and they were also allowed to attend the members' meetings as observers. In this way, Menghe became even more attached to the cooperative. He often said to others: "If it weren't for the cooperative's help, my family would have had to sell two or three cattle just to cover our food and expenses this year. Since January this year, the two and a half bags of flour, three bricks of tea, and two hundred catties of rice that my family has eaten have all been provided by the cooperative." I asked him: "Then why haven't you joined the cooperative yet?" He immediately replied: "Who says I'm not joining? I've already applied to the cooperative, and the cooperative is about to discuss it!" I asked him again: "Are there many people who want to join?" He said: "There are many people who want to join, but no one is as persistent as I am in wanting to join the cooperative. Because I have suffered and learned a lesson in these past few years, I have deeply understood the benefits of the cooperative. If you want to know, I'll tell you about my experience:
    "In the autumn of 1950, one night, Huheletai and three other households approached me to discuss forming a long-term, permanent mutual aid team, asking if I was willing to join. That night, I tossed and turned in bed, thinking: People often say that even brothers who grew up on the same breast can't get along! What about this group of people, each with their own thoughts, without a bridle to control them, how can they succeed? Besides, at that time, I had more livestock than all four of their households combined, and my skills were no worse than theirs, so what good would it do me to join them? After thinking about it all night, the next morning, I drove my livestock away from them and went solo. At that time, everyone asked me: Brother Menghe, why are you leaving? I said bluntly: To create my own happy life!
    "In 1951, I saw that the Huheletai mutual aid team had received 'Suruk' sheep and had a lot of lambs to distribute, and I became envious. I thought: If they can do it, why can't I? In the spring of 1952, I also took in a hundred 'Suruk' sheep. From then on, I was constantly working from morning till night. During the day, I ran around, taking care of the sheep and the cattle, and in the evening, I had to prepare my own meals, working until late at night. From spring to winter, through wind and rain, I worked desperately. Fortunately, the livestock did not disappoint my hard work, and they multiplied a lot in the spring of 1953. The hundred sheep multiplied to about one hundred and ninety, and the cattle also increased from nine to eleven. The breeding of cattle and sheep further increased my confidence. That spring, my son-in-law, Saiyinga, and I discussed asking the government to lend me ten cows (equivalent to 600 new yuan). At this time, how happy I was! With more cattle and sheep, life became even happier. Livestock could lift my spirits and drive away my fatigue. Every day at sunset, when dusk enveloped the grassland, hearing the mooing of cattle and sheep, I was so excited that I couldn't describe it. Every night I would plan in bed: 'Things are looking good now. This year I'll buy a horse so I don't have to run on two legs anymore; next year I'll get a new Mongolian yurt to free up the old one for the young livestock to spend the winter; the year after...' But things didn't turn out as wonderful as I had imagined. Just as winter began, suddenly there were several heavy snowfalls, and after the snow, there were strong winds, which caused great hardship for the livestock. The Huheletai mutual aid team, with their large workforce, quickly and efficiently completed all the winter preparations before the blizzard, with various livestock pens, warm sheds, and plenty of bean cakes and hay for feed. Therefore, the mutual aid team's livestock suffered less damage. But my family was different. After all, with fewer people, they couldn't get the job done, and there was no time to prepare anything before the blizzard came. With no pens for the cattle and sheep, and a shortage of fodder, I sadly watched my beloved livestock fall one by one and cried.
    "After such a disaster, the 'Suruk' sheep not only didn't bring any profit, but I also lost the original sixteen sheep. Good and bad examples were right in front of me. At this time, I had to admire the mutual aid team. But it was too late to regret it. Everyone had kindly advised me to join, but I didn't, and now that I owed debts, how could I face them?
    "At this time, the only thing that encouraged me to continue living was the ten cows lent to me by the government. Cows are different from sheep, they are more resistant to cold and blizzards and did not suffer any losses, but they were also very weak. But as long as I put in the effort and feed them carefully, the cows could still reproduce before the end of the year. However, in the spring, the whole family started getting sick in turn, and with the expenses for food and medical treatment, by the time I calculated in the autumn, only thirteen of the twenty or so cattle, both private and those from the livestock loan, were left. Seeing that winter was approaching again, I was afraid that the weak livestock would suffer further losses, so I quickly returned the government's livestock loan, still owing the government 300 yuan.
    "In order to create my own happy life independently, in these years, I have rushed around, taken risks, and fought step by step. As a result, not only have I failed to achieve my ideals, but I have also fallen into a hole and accumulated debts. It is clear that one person alone cannot do anything. It is really difficult to play a single-stringed fiddle! If you don't think it through, you will suffer."
    Speaking here, Menghe couldn't help but lower his head in silence. He pushed his hat to the back of his head and continued: "What really changed me was the Huheletai cooperative itself, and the various benefits of the cooperative. In June 1954, the Huheletai mutual aid team expanded to thirteen households, transforming from a mutual aid team into a cooperative. People were more organized in their work, truly like the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, each showing their unique abilities, with some specializing in grazing, some in sideline occupations, and some in charge of the settlement work, doing everything calmly and without delay, always ahead of others. Just take their iron carts pulled by camels, which are strong and reliable, and can carry several times more than the 'leilei' carts pulled by cattle, truly like big trucks. Last winter, drawing dozens of camel carts to haul grass for the state-owned farm brought in more than 1,000 yuan. The cooperative used horse-drawn grass cutters, which saved labor and increased efficiency. Last autumn, a few people and a few horses cut 2.3 million catties of grass in less than a month. The cooperative also helped the herdsmen of the entire Hatan Haoshuo Ba Ga (village) to cut grass. When the Ba Ga's grass cutter broke down, the cooperative sent people to repair it. When the horses were not suitable for the harness, the cooperative provided horses or helped to train them. The cooperative's livestock developed particularly quickly. The original four households who organized the mutual aid team have now all replaced their yurts with new ones, which are clean and comfortable. I don't need to describe the bedding and coverings. You can compare it to my home and see for yourself. When a guest comes to my door, I don't even have bedding, so I have to settle the guest on a hard bed board, while they have a whole set of brand-new floral quilts, living such a beautiful life. They were all worse off than me before! And me? I insisted on working alone, left everyone, and ended up in this situation. The more I looked, the more I envied, and the more I thought, the more ashamed I became, so I made up my mind to join the cooperative. Last winter, I led my son-in-law's family to move to the cooperative's winter camp. I thought: Whether the cooperative wants us or not, my family will not leave the cooperative, we must follow the path of the cooperative."

    “非跟牧业生产合作社走不可”
    赛音
    今年五月，我到了内蒙古胡和勒泰牧业生产合作社。头几天，我总以为孟和也是个社员，因为他和社员们一样，同我谈起话来很亲切，合作社的很多事情他都知道。后来一打听，才知道他是一个单干户。
    原来，从一九五四年秋季开始，孟和就成了合作社的常客。他一家人从冬营地到春营地寸步不离地跟着合作社。孟和同他的女婿赛音嘎差不多每天都要到社里走动走动，帮助合作社拉草，巡更查夜，做些零星活。合作社的社员们，也不把他们当外人看待。他缺牲口，缺吃的，合作社就借给他，开社员大会也让他们来旁听。这样一来，孟和对合作社就越发亲热起来了。他常对别人说：“要不是有合作社的帮助，我一家人今年光吃用饮食就得卖两、三头牛。从今年一月以来，我家吃的两袋半白面、三块砖茶、二百斤米全是合作社帮助解决的。”我问他：“那你为什么到现在还不参加合作社呢？”他马上答道：“谁说不参加？我已经向合作社申请过了，合作社就要讨论了！”我又问他：“要求入社的人多不多？”他说：“要入社的人多是多，可是谁也不像我这样，硬赖着要入合作社的。因为我这几年吃了苦头，得到了教训，才深深懂得了合作社的好处。你要想知道的话，我就跟你说说我的事儿吧：
    “一九五零年秋天，有天晚上，胡和勒泰他们四户找我商量要成立一个长期不散的互助组，问我愿不愿参加。那天晚上，我睡下来翻来复去地想：人常说，吃一个奶头长大的亲弟兄还合不到一块呢？何况这一伙子人，各人一条心，没个笼头罩住，还能行？再说，那时我比他们四户的牲畜都多，论本领也不次于他们，同他们闹在一块，还能得到什么好处？这么考虑了一夜，第二天早晨，我就赶着牲畜离开他们单干去了。当时大家问我：孟和哥，为啥要走？我直截了当地说：为了创造我的幸福生活啊！
    “一九五一年，我看到胡和勒泰互助组，因为接‘苏鲁克’羊，分了很多羊羔，我就眼红起来了，心想：这事他们能干，我为什么不能干？一九五二年春天，我也接了一百只“苏鲁克”羊。从此，我一天到晚，总是不歇脚地劳动。白天东跑西颠，顾了羊群，顾不了牛群，晚上回来还得给自己准备茶饭，一直忙到深更半夜。从春到冬，风里雨里，拚死拚活地干。牲畜总算没有辜负我的辛勤劳动，一九五三年春季，繁殖了很多。一百只羊繁殖到一百九十来只，牛也从九头增加到十一头。牛、羊的繁殖，更增加了我的信心，这年春季，我和女婿赛音嘎商量，要求政府贷给我母牛十头（折合新币六百元）。这时，我心里多么高兴啊！牛、羊多了，生活更加幸福了。牲畜能够提起我的精神，赶走我的疲劳，每当日落西山，黄昏笼罩大草原的时候，听到牛羊的哞哞声，兴奋得简直无法形容。每晚我总是在被窝里盘算：‘这下好日子算开头了，今年买一匹马，就不再靠两条腿跑了；明年换个新蒙古包，好把旧蒙古包腾出来准备幼畜过冬用；后年……。’可是，事情并不像我所想的那样美妙。刚刚入冬，忽然下了几场大雪，雪后又是刮大风，可把牲畜糟塌苦了。胡和勒泰互助组，人多手快，七手八脚，在暴风雪以前，就把一切过冬准备工作做得样样齐全，有各种畜圈，又有保暖棚，还有豆饼和大批干草作饲料。因此，互助组的牲畜遭受损失较少。可是我家就不同了，终究是人少不出活，什么也来不及准备，暴风雪就来了。牛羊没有圈，草料缺乏，眼看可爱的牲畜一个一个倒下去，我伤心地哭起来了。
    “经这么一次灾害的袭击，接的‘苏鲁克’羊，不但没见利，还亏损了十六只羊的老本。好坏事例摆在我眼前，这时，我不得不钦佩互助组。可是后悔也来不及了。当初大家一片好心左劝右劝，自己不参加，现在自己欠下了账，再去参加，拿啥脸见人呢？
    “这时，唯一鼓舞我生活下去的，是政府贷给的那十头牛。牛和羊不同，它比较能耐寒抗风雪，没有受一点损失，只是也瘦弱不堪了。但只要加把力，尽心喂养，年前年后，牛还可以见到繁殖。可是，到了春天，一家人又轮流害起病来，连人吃带看病化费，到了秋季算下来，私有和牧贷的二十来头牛，只剩下十三头。眼看就要入冬了，我又怕瘦弱的牲畜再受损失，就赶紧交还政府的牧业贷款，还欠下政府三百元。
    “我为了单独创造自己的幸福生活，在这几年，左冲右撞，冒着风险，步步搏斗，结果不但没有实现我的理想，反倒蹋下了窟窿，背上了账。可见得孤孤单单一个人什么也做不来，这真是单弦胡琴不好拉呀！一时想不到，就得受罪。”
    说到这里，孟和不由得低下头沉默起来了。他把帽子往后脑勺上推了推，又接着说：“使我真正转变过来的是胡和勒泰合作社本身，是合作社的种种好处。一九五四年六月间，胡和勒泰互助组扩大到十三户，由互助组转为合作社。人家干起活来，更有条有理了，真是八仙过海，各显神通，有专门放牧的，有搞副业的，有负责定居地的工作的，不慌不忙地，啥事都做在别人前头，啥事都误不了。光说人家的用骆驼拉的铁车吧，又结实又顶事，比起牛拉的嘞嘞车，能多拉好几倍，真像个大卡车啦。去年冬季，抽数十来挂骆驼车，给国营牧场拉草就收入一千多元。合作社打草用马拉打草机，这玩艺儿，又能节省人力，又能出活。去年秋季，几个人，几匹马，不到一个月就打了二百三十万斤草。合作社还帮助全哈坦浩硕巴嘎（村）牧民打草。巴嘎的打草机坏了，社里去人给修理，马不服套，社里给出马或帮助驯马。合作社的牲畜发展得特别快。他们最初组织互助组的四户现在都换上了新蒙古包，包里又清洁，又舒服，铺的盖的不必我来叙述，你和我家一比就知道。你看咱贵客临门，连个铺的都没有，只好把客人安置在硬邦邦的床板上，人家左一套右一套，都有崭新的花被褥，生活过得多美。他们原先都还不如我啊！我呢？硬要单干，离开了大家，落到这般下场。我越看越羡慕，越想越惭愧，便下定决心要参加合作社，去年冬天，我就领着我女婿一家人，搬到合作社的冬营地。我想：合作社要我们也罢，不要也罢，我这一家人是不离合作社了，非跟着合作社走不可。”
