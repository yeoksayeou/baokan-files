Yue Opera in Moscow
By Our Correspondents Li He and Su Lan

The Soviet people warmly welcomed and happily watched the performances of the Chinese Yue Opera Troupe in Moscow and throughout the Soviet Union, giving Yue Opera a fair, insightful, comprehensive, and highly appreciative evaluation. This reflects the Soviet people's love for Chinese art on the one hand, and the Soviet audience's talent for appreciating and discerning world art on the other.

The Soviet people were very eager to see Chinese drama. Years ago, they welcomed Mei Lanfang's Peking Opera. Four years ago, they welcomed the "White Haired Girl" opera performed by the China Youth Art Troupe. Now, they are applauding the "Romance of the West Chamber" and "The Butterfly Lovers" performed by the Chinese Yue Opera Troupe.

During its stay in Moscow, the Chinese Yue Opera Troupe performed "Romance of the West Chamber" on August 9th, 10th, and 11th, the short plays "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet" and "Beating the Golden Branch" on the 12th, and "The Butterfly Lovers" on the 13th, 14th, and 15th. On the 10th and 15th, Moscow Television broadcast "Romance of the West Chamber" and "The Butterfly Lovers." After the performance on the 9th, the "Astonishing Beauty" scene from "Romance of the West Chamber" was filmed.

The language barrier did not become an insurmountable obstacle for the audience to appreciate Yue Opera. After watching, people said: "The 'Romance of the West Chamber' and 'The Butterfly Lovers' performed by the Yue Opera Troupe are full of people's character." "These are realistic masterpieces." "These are beautiful lyrical poems."

The importance and evaluation of Yue Opera are concentrated in the reviews of various newspapers. "Pravda," "Izvestia," "Trud," "Soviet Culture," "Literary Gazette," "Komsomolskaya Pravda"... all successively published a large number of articles introducing Yue Opera and the Yue Opera Troupe, and reviewing "Romance of the West Chamber" and "The Butterfly Lovers."

"Yue Opera is rapidly spreading widely among the people. This is because this opera is characterized by realism and true popular appeal," said "Pravda" on the 8th when introducing Yue Opera. On the 11th, after the first performance of Yue Opera, it wrote: "Following Comrade Mao Zedong's wise instructions, advanced workers of Chinese opera have been able to abandon many outdated and obsolete things that stagnated national drama, while preserving the beautiful, long-standing, and excellent dynamic traditions of people's culture that run through the spirit of true democracy. Now, these traditions have gained new meaning and new development in Yue Opera, and in the young, talented, and diligent troupe, these traditions have received realistic affirmation."

"A Poem of Noble Love"—this is how "Pravda" described "Romance of the West Chamber" in a commentary written by Khubov published on the 11th. The author said: "'Romance of the West Chamber' has received a highly authentic, very detailed, and inspiring interpretation in Yue Opera." "This play is captivating with its true musicality, aesthetic sense, directorial talent, the refinement of actors' skills, and especially the inner melody that unifies the entire development of the stage performance—the story." The "Literary Gazette" published Aitlin's commentary on the 11th, saying that people saw in "Romance of the West Chamber" "an extremely simple and extremely realistic drama, a brilliant art connected with folk traditions and extremely modernized, a highly ideological art, rich in national characteristics and at the same time close to everyone." "Soviet Culture" published an article by Russian Federation People's Actor Sveshnikov on the 11th. He believed that the performance of "Romance of the West Chamber" had two characteristics: first, the astonishing lyrical warmth, gentleness, and sincerity of the story's tone; and second, the profound psychological performance of the image, especially the image of Cui Yingying.

Newspapers praised the image of Cui Yingying created by Yuan Xuefen. Khubov said: "The protagonist played by the talented actress Yuan Xuefen leaves a deep impression. The Yingying image she created on the vocal stage is full of extremely pure and gentle dreams. Her soft voice sings expressively and crisply, and her stage movements are charmingly graceful." Sveshnikov said that Yuan Xuefen revealed to the audience the psychological depths of the classic image of Cui Yingying in Chinese drama.

Xu Yulan, who played Zhang Gong, Lü Ruiying, who played Hongniang, and Zhang Guifeng, who played Madame Cui, were praised by newspapers for their ability to express the characters' personalities. The audience liked Zhang Gong's sincerity and nobility, and Hongniang's innocence, humor, and sense of justice. Many newspapers pointed out that due to the realistic content and superb acting skills, the audience could not see that the male roles on the stage were played by female actors.

Soviet art circles believe that Yue Opera is more comprehensive than European opera, combining drama, pantomime, and opera. The performance on the stage is so harmonious that even when the orchestra stops playing, the music continues to sound in the actors' synchronized and graceful movements. Khubov pointed out that the folk rhythms selected and refined by "Romance of the West Chamber" are capable of depicting the characters and scenes on the stage, and are rich and delightful, but if the orchestra expands and supplements a batch of low-pitched instruments, the effect of the music will be even greater. Composer Koval also pointed out in an article published in "Trud" on the 13th that the music in "Romance of the West Chamber" can give accurate rhythm to dialogue scenes, narrate events, emphasize climaxes, and sensitively reflect every inner excitement of the actors. The sets and costumes of "Romance of the West Chamber" also aroused great interest. Anastasiev's article published in "Komsomolskaya Pravda" on the 11th said: "Muscovites saw in 'Romance of the West Chamber' not only the wonderful image of stage art, but also the unparalleled painting of the Chinese people. Each set reproduces the nature and art of China. All of these are picturesque, beautiful, and help to convey the atmosphere of the characters' lives well, no wonder they won warm applause every time the curtain rose."

The plot of "Romance of the West Chamber" is not unfamiliar to the Soviet people, because "Romance of the West Chamber" has been translated into Russian and performed in theaters in Moscow. The plot of "The Butterfly Lovers" is completely new to the Moscow audience. The audience said: "This is the Chinese Romeo and Juliet." The "Pavilion Meeting" scene made many viewers' eyes red, and even shed tears. TASS reported: "The audience was deeply moved and praised the drama based on the poetic story of the self-sacrifice of two lovers." "Soviet Culture" published Shakva's article "Fragrant Flowers of Chinese Art" on the 16th. After introducing the story of "The Butterfly Lovers" in detail, the author said: "After many centuries of polishing, the story now preserves its undying beauty and completely picturesque form. The story is full of the spirit of fierce protest against feudal social prejudices."

"Pravda" published Kabalevsky's commentary titled "Youth of Ancient Culture" on the 15th. The author had seen the Yue Opera "The Butterfly Lovers" in Beijing in October 1951. He said: "In Beijing, this play gave me a great impression with its poetry, profound musicality, and beautiful acting. How much has the Yue Opera Troupe progressed in this short period! The talented workers of the Yue Opera Troupe are true innovators. They are good at combining the richest and longest traditions of classical opera with the realism of modern drama creation, cherishing and developing the national form of their art."

The newspapers praised Fan Ruijuan, who played Liang Shanbo, and Fu Quanxiang, who played Zhu Yingtai. The above-mentioned two authors said that Fan Ruijuan created the image of a pure, noble, and somewhat naive youth. Fan Ruijuan performed realistically in the scene of female impersonation and "Eighteen Farewell Scenes" without a full set. Fu Quanxiang performed well in lyrical scenes, but her stage and musical talents were most fully revealed in dramatic and tragic scenes. The monologue before Zhu Yingtai's sacrifice is a true peak of performance. The image she created is the embodiment of the heroine's bravery and great love. Zhang Guifeng played the old man Zhu Gongyuan in "The Butterfly Lovers" as realistically as the old woman Madame Cui in "Romance of the West Chamber", which is also amazing.

Like "Romance of the West Chamber", "The Butterfly Lovers" also made the Soviet people feel great interest in the combination of opera and drama, and the interweaving of music with action and rap. Kabalevsky believed that the inclusion of symphonic interludes and various scattered vocal parts in the performance of "The Butterfly Lovers" was a great progress. The audience was very satisfied with the musical atmosphere of the last few scenes of the play. People felt that the orchestra played very well, and the unique tone of Chinese instruments could enhance the touching effect of the music.

The newspapers paid great respect to Wu Chen, the director of the Chinese Yue Opera Troupe, Liu Ruzeng, the music director of "Romance of the West Chamber", and Gu Zhenxia, the music director of "The Butterfly Lovers", as well as Su Shifeng and Xing Xi, the stage designers of the two plays.

During its performance in Moscow, the Chinese Yue Opera Troupe had contact with the Soviet drama circles and exchanged experiences. On the 14th, Soviet directors and actors accompanied the Yue Opera Troupe on a tour of the Moscow River. On the boat, Na. Fe. Malekaya, Ma. So. Gofandina, and Ma. Li. Miltser, the directors of the operas "The Tempest," "Eugene Onegin," and "Zaporozhets Beyond the Danube," and Xu Guangping, Wu Chen, Yuan Xuefen, and others had a conversation. They believed that Yue Opera could express inner feelings more deeply than Peking Opera. They said: The restrained emotions expressed by the protagonists in "Romance of the West Chamber" are originally very difficult to express. They felt that Yue Opera has Stanislavski's performance principles, because it successfully combines inner feelings and external performance. They were surprised that the singing, dialogue, and music in Yue Opera are so accurately coordinated. They inquired about the experience in this regard. Xu Guangping, Wu Chen, Yuan Xuefen, and others also asked them about some questions in Stanislavski's creative methods and their experience in performing directorial work.

Soviet People's Artist Obraztsov has a great interest in Yue Opera. He is writing a book introducing Chinese opera, which will introduce Yue Opera. He believed that in the "Eighteen Farewell Scenes" of "The Butterfly Lovers", the scenery and the actors' movements are not harmonious enough. The scenery has mountains and rivers, but the actors' movements include a wider range. For example, they arrived at a temple for a while, and a well for a while, but there were no such things in the scenery. He felt that the scenery could be more specific, adding temples, wells, etc. to match the singing; or it could give play to the characteristics of Chinese opera, such as the play "Qiu Jiang", as long as the actors' movements are enough. Wu Chen said: It is still difficult to install all the scenery under the current conditions, but Obraztsov's opinion is highly valued.

The performances of the Chinese Yue Opera Troupe in Moscow and Minsk were successful. It will continue to meet with Soviet audiences in Leningrad, Sverdlovsk, and Novosibirsk. The Soviet people believe that the performance of Yue Opera in the Soviet Union will help the exchange of Chinese and Soviet culture and art. The people of the Yue Opera Troupe believe that the performance in the Soviet Union is very beneficial for further improving Yue Opera in the future.

### 越剧在莫斯科

    越剧在莫斯科
    本报记者　李何　苏蓝
    苏联人热烈地欢迎和高兴地观看了中国越剧团在莫斯科和苏联各地的演出，给了越剧以中肯的、精辟的、全面的、高度的评价。这一方面反映了苏联人民对中国艺术的喜爱，另一方面表现了苏联观众富有欣赏和鉴别世界艺术的才能。
    苏联人是非常想看中国戏剧的。多年前他们欢迎了梅兰芳的京剧，四年前他们欢迎了中国青年文工团演出的“白毛女”歌剧，而现在他们为中国越剧团演出的“西厢记”和“梁山伯与祝英台”喝采。
    中国越剧团在莫斯科期间，九、十、十一日演出了“西厢记”，十二日演出了短剧“拾玉镯”和“打金枝”，十三、十四、十五日演出了“梁山伯与祝英台”。十日和十五日，莫斯科电视台传播了“西厢记”和“梁山伯与祝英台”。九日演出后，“西厢记”中“惊艳”一场被拍成了电影。
    语言的隔阂没有成为观众欣赏越剧的不可超越的障碍。人们观后纷纷说：“越剧团演出的‘西厢记’和‘梁山伯与祝英台’充满着人民性。”“这是现实主义的巨作。”“这是美妙的抒情的诗篇。”
    对越剧的重视和评价，集中表现在各个报纸的评论上。“真理报”、“消息报”、“劳动报”、“苏维埃文化报”、“文学报”、“共青团真理报”……都接连发表了大量文章介绍越剧和越剧团，评论“西厢记”和“梁山伯与祝英台”。
    “越剧迅速在民间广泛流传。这是因为这种剧是以现实主义和真正的人民性为特点的”——“真理报”八日介绍越剧时这样说。十一日，在越剧首次演出后又写道：“遵循毛泽东同志的英明指示，中国歌剧的先进工作者能够抛弃许多过时的、陈旧的、使民族的戏剧停滞的东西，而保存美好的、悠久的、贯穿着真正民主主义精神的人民文化的优秀的有活力的传统，现在这些传统在越剧中获得了新的意义和新的发展，在年青的、天才的和勤勉的剧团中，这些传统得到了现实主义的肯定。”
    “高尚的爱情的诗”——“真理报”十一日发表的这篇由胡波夫写的评论这样称颂了“西厢记”。作者说：“‘西厢记’在越剧中得到了高度真实的、非常细致的、令人鼓舞的演释。”“这个剧以真正的音乐性，美感，导演的才能，演员技巧的精炼，特别是那把台上表演——故事——的全部发展统一起来的内在旋律，令人入迷。”“文学报”十一日发表艾特林的评论说，人们从“西厢记”里看到了“极纯朴和极现实主义的剧，同民间的传统联系并且极为现代化的光辉的艺术，高度思想性的艺术，富有民族色彩而同时接近每个人”。“苏维埃文化报”十一日发表了俄罗斯联邦共和国人民演员斯维什尼科夫的文章。他认为“西厢记”的演出有两个特点：第一是故事情调的惊人的抒情的温暖、柔和、真挚；第二是形象的心理表演的深刻，特别是崔莺莺的形象。
    报纸都赞美袁雪芬所创造的崔莺莺的形象。胡波夫说：“天才女演员袁雪芬扮演的主角给人留下深刻的印象。她所创造的声乐舞台上的莺莺形象，充满着极端纯洁和温柔的梦想。柔和的嗓子有表情地、清脆地唱着，她的舞台动作迷人地优美。”斯维什尼科夫说，袁雪芬向观众表露了莺莺这个中国戏剧的古典形象的心理深处。
    饰张珙的徐玉兰，饰红娘的吕瑞英和饰崔夫人的张桂凤，因为她们都善于表达人物的性格而受到了报纸的好评。观众喜欢张珙的诚挚高尚，红娘的天真诙谐和富有正义感。许多报纸指出，由于现实主义的内容和高明的演技，观众看不出舞台上的男角是女演员扮的。
    苏联艺术界人士认为：越剧比欧洲的歌剧是更加综合的，它把话剧、哑剧、歌剧都综合在一起。舞台上演得这样调和，甚至当乐队停奏的时候，音乐继续在演员们的合拍的优美的动作中响着。胡波夫指出：“西厢记”所挑选和提炼的民间韵律是能够刻画出剧中人物和舞台的情景的，是丰富的、令人倾心的，但如果乐队扩大和补充一批低音乐器，那么音乐的效果会更大。“劳动报”十三日发表的作曲家科瓦尔的文章中也指出，“西厢记”中的音乐能够给对话场面以准确的节拍，能够叙述事件，强调高潮，灵敏地反映演员每个内心的激动。“西厢记”的布景和服装也引起人们的巨大兴趣。“共青团真理报”十一日发表的阿纳斯塔西也夫的文章说：“莫斯科人在‘西厢记’中看到了不单舞台艺术的极妙形象，还有中国人民的无与伦比的绘画。每幕布景都再现出中国的自然和艺术。所有这些都是如画的、美丽的，很好地帮助传递人物的生活气氛，无怪在每当幕启时都博得热烈的鼓掌。”
    “西厢记”的剧情对于苏联人还不算怎样生疏，因为“西厢记”曾经被译成俄文，而且在莫斯科的剧院演出着。“梁山伯与祝英台”的剧情对于莫斯科观众是完全新鲜的。观众们说：“这是中国的罗密欧与朱利叶。”“楼台会”一节使不少观众的眼眶都红了，甚至掉了泪。塔斯社的消息说：“观众深深地感动和赞扬这个以两个情人的自我牺牲的诗一般的故事为基础的戏剧。”“苏维埃文化报”十六日发表了沙克瓦的文章“中国艺术的香花”。作者在详细介绍“梁山伯与祝英台”的故事后说：“经过许多世纪的琢磨，故事现在保存着不谢的美妙和完全如画的形式。故事中充满着反对封建社会偏见的激烈抗议的精神。”
    “真理报”十五日发表了卡巴列夫斯基以“古老文化的青春”为题的评论。作者曾在一九五一年十月在北京看过越剧“梁山伯与祝英台”。他说：“在北京时候，这个剧以它的诗意、深刻的音乐性和漂亮的演技，给我巨大的印象。在这短短期间，越剧团进步得多么大呵！越剧团的天才的工作人员们是真正的革新者。他们善于把古典歌剧的最丰富的悠久的传统同现代戏剧创作的现实主义结合起来，爱护和发展自己艺术的民族形式。”
    报纸称道扮演梁山伯的范瑞娟和祝英台的傅全香。上述两位作者说：范瑞娟创造了纯洁的、崇高的和有点稚气的青年的形象。范瑞娟在以女扮男和“十八相送”一场没有全部布景的条件下演得逼真。傅全香在抒情场面演得好，但她的舞台和音乐的才能最充分地表露在戏剧性和悲剧性的场面。在祝英台牺牲前的独白，是表演的真正高峰。她所创造的形象是少女的英勇和伟大爱情的体现。张桂凤在“梁山伯与祝英台”中饰老汉祝公远同在“西厢记”中饰老妇崔夫人一样逼真，也使人惊叹。
    “梁山伯与祝英台”和“西厢记”一样，使苏联人感到巨大兴趣的，是歌剧同话剧的结合，是音乐同动作和说唱的交织。卡巴列夫斯基认为，“梁山伯与祝英台”演出时有交响乐的插曲，以及各种分散的声乐音部，是很大的进步。观众很满意这个剧后面几场的音乐气氛。人们觉得乐队演奏得很好，中国乐器的特有的音调能够加强音乐的动人效果。
    报纸都把巨大的敬意寄与中国越剧团的导演吴琛，“西厢记”的音乐指挥刘如曾和“梁山伯与祝英台”的音乐指挥顾振遐，两剧的舞台设计苏石风和幸熙。
    中国越剧团在莫斯科演出期间曾经和苏联戏剧界进行了接触，交流了经验。十四日，苏联导演和演员们陪同越剧团游莫斯科河。在船上，歌剧“暴风雨”、“叶夫根尼·奥涅金”、“多瑙河彼岸的萨坡罗什人”的导演纳·费·马列卡雅、玛·索·郭凡狄娜、玛·里·米尔采尔和许广平、吴琛、袁雪芬等进行了谈话。她们认为，越剧比京剧更能深刻地表达内心感情。她们说：像“西厢记”中主角所表达的克制的感情，本来是很难表达的。她们觉得，越剧是具有斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的表演原则的，因为它很成功地使内心感情和外在表演相结合。她们很惊奇：越剧中的歌唱和对白和音乐配合得这么准确。她们询问了这方面的经验。许广平、吴琛和袁雪芬等也请教了她们关于斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的创造方法中的一些问题，和她们执行导演工作的经验。
    苏联人民演员奥布拉兹卓夫对于越剧怀着巨大的兴趣。他正写一本介绍中国戏曲的书，其中将介绍越剧。他认为，“梁山伯与祝英台”中的“十八相送”一场，布景和演员的动作不够调和。布景有山有水，但演员的动作包括更广。如一会儿到了庙宇，一会儿到了井边，但布景上没有这些东西。他觉得可以把布景更具体化，加上庙宇、水井等，以配合演唱；也可以发挥中国戏曲的特点，如“秋江”一剧那样只要演员的动作。吴琛表示：目前要装置全部布景在条件上还有困难，但对奥布拉兹卓夫的意见很重视。
    中国越剧团在莫斯科和明斯克的演出是有成绩的。它将在列宁格勒、斯维尔德洛夫斯克、新西伯利亚继续和苏联观众见面。苏联人们认为，越剧在苏联的演出，有助于中苏文化艺术的交流。越剧团的人们认为，在苏联的演出，对于今后进一步提高越剧，是非常有益的。
