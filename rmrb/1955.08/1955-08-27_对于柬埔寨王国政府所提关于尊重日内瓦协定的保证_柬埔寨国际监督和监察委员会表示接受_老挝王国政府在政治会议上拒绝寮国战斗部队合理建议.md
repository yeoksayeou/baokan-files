Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 26th - According to the Press Trust of India: The International Supervisory and Control Commission for Cambodia has notified the Royal Government of Cambodia that the Commission accepts its guarantee that, regarding the Cambodia-United States military aid agreement, the Royal Government will always earnestly respect the terms of the Geneva Accords, although certain clauses of this military aid agreement "exceed the scope stipulated by the Geneva Accords in their wording."

The Commission's acceptance of the Royal Government's guarantee was communicated in a letter dated July 23rd. This letter was officially released in New Delhi on the evening of the 24th.

After the Royal Government of Cambodia concluded a military aid agreement with the United States in May of this year, it requested the International Commission to express its opinion on the US-Cambodia military aid agreement in accordance with the Geneva Accords. On May 30th, the Commission reviewed the provisions of this military aid agreement "in order to determine whether it contradicted the Geneva Accords." At that time, some members of the Commission expressed opposition, believing that certain clauses of the agreement did not fully comply with the Geneva Accords.

Therefore, the International Commission requested the Royal Government to provide certain clarifications. The Royal Government and the Commission also discussed the meaning of these clauses, at which time the Prime Minister of the Royal Government of Cambodia presented the Royal Government's interpretation and understanding of this military aid agreement. This interpretation was later confirmed by the Royal Government.

In its reply, the International Commission notified the Royal Government of Cambodia that the Commission welcomed the Royal Government's clarification and its following guarantee: "It will always earnestly respect the terms of the Geneva Accords."

The International Commission also stated in its letter: "The Commission takes note of the Royal Government's guarantee that it will pursue a policy of neutrality."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 26th - Vietnam News Agency reported: "Lao News" said on August 11th that the Lao Royal Government's political delegation had submitted a second letter to the Lao Fighting Units' political delegation at the Lao political conference, containing the Royal side's opinions on the issue of the two regrouping provinces of the Lao Fighting Units.

This letter rejected the Lao side's proposal to incorporate the Lao administration in these two provinces into the Royal administration and to hold free general elections nationwide with the participation of the Lao Fighting Units. The Royal Government of Laos put forward the following three proposals:

(1) Administrative institutions similar to the Royal administrative institutions in the other ten provinces of Laos should be established in Sam Neua and Phongsaly provinces.

(2) The Royal Government will appoint its people to take control of the administration of these two provinces.

(3) The Lao Fighting Units should be disarmed and disbanded.

"Lao News" pointed out that the Royal Government, through these unreasonable proposals, wants the Lao Fighting Units to surrender, thus creating new difficulties for the continuation of the political conference.

　　对于柬埔寨王国政府所提关于尊重日内瓦协定的保证
　　柬埔寨国际监督和监察委员会表示接受
　　老挝王国政府在政治会议上拒绝寮国战斗部队合理建议
    新华社新德里二十六日电　据印度报业托辣斯消息：柬埔寨国际监督和监察委员会已经通知柬埔寨王国政府，委员会接受它的保证，在柬埔寨—美国军事援助协定问题上，王国政府将始终认真地尊重日内瓦协定的条款，虽然，这个军事援助协定的某些条款“在措词上超过了日内瓦协定所规定的范围”。
    委员会接受王国政府的保证是在七月二十三日的一封信中通知它的。这封信二十四日晚上在新德里正式发表了。
    柬埔寨王国政府在今年五月间同美国缔结军事援助协定以后，曾经要求国际委员会根据日内瓦协定对美柬军事援助协定发表意见。委员会在五月三十日审查了这个军事援助协定的规定，“以便断定它是否和日内瓦协定矛盾”。当时，委员会中有人表示反对，认为这个协定的某些条款并不完全符合日内瓦协定。
    因此，国际委员会要求王国政府进行某些澄清。王国政府和委员会还讨论了这些条款的含义，当时，柬埔寨王国政府首相提出了王国政府对这个军事援助协定的解释和理解。这个解释后来为王国政府所确认。
    国际委员会在它的答复中通知柬埔寨王国政府说，委员会欢迎王国政府的澄清和它的下列保证：“它将始终认真地尊重日内瓦协定的条款。”
    国际委员会在信中还说：“委员会注意到王国政府关于它将奉行中立政策的保证。”
    新华社河内二十六日电　越南通讯社讯：“寮国新闻”在八月十一日说，老挝王国政府政治代表团已经在老挝政治会议上，把包含着王国方面对于寮国战斗部队两个集结省份问题的意见的第二封信交给了寮国战斗部队政治代表团。
    这封信拒绝了寮国方面所提出的关于把寮国在这两省中的行政机构并入王国的行政机构中同时在全国举行有寮国战斗部队参加的自由普选的建议。老挝王国政府提出了下列三项建议：
    （一）应当在桑怒省和丰沙里省建立同老挝其他十省中的王国行政机构相似的行政机构。
    （二）王国政府将委任他们的人来掌握这两省的行政机构。
    （三）寮国战斗部队应当解除武装并且解散。
    “寮国新闻”指出，王国政府通过这些不合理的建议要寮国战斗部队投降，因而为继续进行政治会议造成了新的困难。
