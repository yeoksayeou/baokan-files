    Hanyang Sleeper Preservation Plant

    Railway steel rails are laid on the roadbed with sleepers underneath. Laying one kilometer of railway requires over a thousand sleepers; each sleeper can only be used for three or four years, or even one or two years, before rotting and deteriorating, requiring replacement with new sleepers. However, the source of sleepers is not easy to come by. The one thousand plus sleepers needed for one kilometer of railway require planting trees on thirty to forty mu of land, taking twenty to thirty years to grow into usable timber. To extend the service life of sleepers and save the country's timber resources, carrying out sleeper preservation treatment has become a very important and effective measure.
    The Hanyang Sleeper Preservation Plant, which started production last October, was built to achieve this task. It is the largest sleeper preservation plant in our country, responsible for supplying preserved sleepers to eight railway administrations, including Guangzhou, Beijing, Liuzhou, Shanghai, Jinan, Tianjin, Taiyuan, and Zhengzhou. In addition, they also process utility poles for the Jier Line and the Wuye Line (Wuhan to Daye). The plant's method for preserving sleepers is: adding preservative oil (a byproduct of coking) to the raw sleepers, and after steaming them in pressurized tanks, each sleeper can be used for fifteen to twenty years; while the cost per sleeper only increases by a little more than one yuan compared to raw sleepers. At the same time, it can also use lower-quality wood to make sleepers, saving a large amount of high-quality wood for use in more important construction projects.
    When the sleeper preservation plant first started production, due to lack of experience, the product quality was not very good, and the cost was relatively high. Later, based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, the production management was improved, and all the staff also actively came up with solutions, and the production situation has gradually improved. The workers changed the past method of opening and closing two steaming tanks at the same time to a cross-switching method, which greatly reduced the idle time in production and improved production efficiency. They also increased the temperature of the preservative oil, ensuring the quality of preservation and saving oil consumption. From last October to this May, the total production plan was overfulfilled by 113.7 percent, and the ex-factory price of each preserved sleeper was reduced from 16.59 yuan to 14.93 yuan, and the product quality was also guaranteed.
    Recently, the Hanyang Sleeper Preservation Plant plans to lay two more short sidings near the steaming tanks to further shorten the time for sleepers to enter and exit the tanks; and is purchasing two cranes to reduce the heavy manual labor of carrying sleepers on shoulders.

### 汉阳枕木防腐厂

    汉阳枕木防腐厂

    铁路的钢轨是用枕木垫起来，铺在路基上的。铺设一公里长的铁路，就要一千几百根枕木；每根枕木只能使用三、四年，甚至一、二年便要腐朽变质，又需更换新的枕木。但是枕木的来源却很不容易。一公里铁路所需的一千几百根枕木，就得用三、四十亩地去植树，需要二、三十年的时间才能生长成材。为了延长枕木的使用年限，节省国家的木材，进行枕木防腐处理，就成为一个很重要的有效措施。
    去年十月开工生产的汉阳枕木防腐厂就是为了实现这个任务建设起来的。它是我国最大的一座枕木防腐厂，担负着供应广州、北京、柳州、上海、济南、天津、太原、郑州等八个铁路管理局的防腐枕木任务。另外，他们还为集二线和武冶线（武汉到大冶）加工电线杆。这个厂防腐枕木的办法是：把素枕加上防腐油（一种炼焦的副产品），在蒸制罐内蒸制之后，每根枕木可使用十五年到二十年；而每根枕木的成本只比素枕增加一元多。同时，它还可以改用品种较差的木材来作枕木，节省大批优良品种的木材用到更重要的建设工程上去。
    枕木防腐厂刚开始生产时，由于经验不足，产品质量不很好，成本也比较高。后来，根据苏联专家的建议改进了生产管理，全体职工也积极想办法，生产情况已逐渐好转。职工们把过去两个蒸制罐同时开关的办法改为交叉开关的办法后，大大减少生产的间隙时间，提高了生产效率。他们还提高了防腐油的温度，保证了防腐质量，并节省了用油量。从去年十月到今年五月，总计超额完成生产计划百分之一百一十三点七，每根防腐枕木的出厂价格由十六元五角九分，降低到十四元九角三分，产品质量也得到了保证。
    最近，汉阳枕木防腐厂计划在蒸制罐附近再铺设两股小岔道，进一步缩短枕木进出罐的时间；并正在购置两部吊车，以减轻人工肩扛枕木的繁重的体力劳动。
