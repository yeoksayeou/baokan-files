Overcoming the Great Enemy of Maritime Transport – Typhoons
Zhang Yuxin, Director of the Maritime Supervision Office of the Guangzhou Maritime Transport Administration

Typhoons have always been the most ferocious enemy of maritime transport. The typhoons that occur in the eastern seas of Asia average about 22 times a year, the highest number in the world. They affect a wide area and are very strong. The maximum wind force near the center of a typhoon is often above force 12, which is very destructive. Every year during the summer and autumn seasons, from May to November, typhoons often strike China's coastal areas, especially the coastal areas of South China, which often suffer sudden typhoon attacks without timely warnings.

Before liberation, because the broad masses of people lacked scientific knowledge and common sense about typhoon prevention, and because the reactionary government at that time was indifferent to the lives and property of the people, the people in coastal areas suffered very heavy losses to their lives and property whenever a typhoon struck. For example, when the center of a typhoon passed over Zhapu in July 1915, 26 ships sank at the Wusongkou in Shanghai, more than 200 floating corpses were found in the Huangpu River, and countless houses and trees were collapsed and destroyed. When a typhoon struck Shantou in 1922, it caused a tsunami, and in addition to inestimable material losses, about 50,000 people drowned. The fierceness of typhoons often caused great damage even to huge ships of tens of thousands of tons. For example, when a typhoon struck Hong Kong in September 1937, 28 large ships ran aground or were wrecked in the four most intense hours of the storm, including several large mail ships. From these examples, it can be seen how serious the harm of typhoons is. The reactionary governments of the past, like other natural disasters, were not only at a loss about typhoon disasters and disregarded the lives and deaths of the people, but also took the opportunity to exploit the people under the pretext of disaster relief, further aggravating the suffering of the coastal people.

In the few years since liberation, under the care of the Party and Chairman Mao, relying on the wisdom of the masses, using various scientific instruments for predicting weather and typhoon prevention equipment, establishing a formal weather forecasting system, taking various effective preventive measures, creating and promoting many advanced methods, and resolutely fighting against typhoons, the losses suffered by ships at sea and coastal areas from typhoon disasters have been significantly reduced year by year. The ships and sailors responsible for maritime transport have been standing at the forefront of the heroic struggle against typhoons for several years, and many heroic ships and figures who have overcome typhoons have emerged. For example, the Nanhai 163 ship in Haikou in October 1953, and the Nanhai 174 ship in Zhanjiang in August 1954, both overcame the rare typhoons in the area for decades and maintained the safety of the ships. They were commended and rewarded by the Maritime Transport Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications.

Based on our practical experience in typhoon prevention in maritime transport in South China over the years, to do this work well, first of all, a strong leading core must be established organizationally to lead the overall typhoon prevention preparation work in a unified manner. Our bureau's typhoon prevention command department is composed of dispatch, supervision, mechanical affairs, political, communications and other departments. The director of the business bureau acts as the commander-in-chief, uniformly leading and dispatching maritime transport ships in South China, and maintaining close contact and cooperation with the Marine Meteorological Observatory, so that ships and shores can fully perform their functions. Under the unified leadership of the captain, the ship's various business departments carry out their respective tasks in accordance with their duties. After receiving a typhoon warning, the captain convenes a meeting of all crew members to mobilize them and explain the typhoon prevention precautions based on the specific conditions of the ship; the ship's Party branch convenes a meeting of Party members and Youth League members to call on Party members and Youth League members to play a leading and backbone role in the typhoon prevention struggle; and the ship's grassroots trade union also promptly carries out publicity and mobilization work among the masses. This is an important guarantee for overcoming typhoons. As mentioned above, the Nanhai 163 and 174 ships, due to strong organizational work and good mass mobilization, in the most intense stage of the typhoon, trees were uprooted and houses collapsed on the shore, and highway bridges were destroyed, but the crew members still stuck to their posts in the gale and torrential rain and fought bravely against the typhoon, finally overcoming the typhoon without suffering any losses. In peacetime, it is also necessary to strengthen political education for the crew members so that they can establish a sense of ownership. Before the arrival of the typhoon season every year, all crew members should be organized to study typhoon prevention knowledge to improve their technical level of typhoon prevention. In particular, it is necessary to raise the crew members' vigilance ideologically and overcome the emotions of paralysis, adventure, and "fear of trouble" in typhoon prevention work.

Secondly, technically, it is necessary to skillfully master and analyze meteorological conditions, correctly judge the center position, distance, and moving direction of the typhoon, and take all typhoon prevention measures and typhoon avoidance driving methods, with typhoon avoidance as the main focus. After the typhoon forms in the ocean, the typhoon prevention headquarters should maintain close contact with meteorological stations and other units to grasp all aspects of the situation and pay attention to the development trend of the typhoon with a hundredfold vigilance. When the typhoon threat becomes obvious, according to the development of the typhoon and the position and performance of the ships, dispatch them in time to avoid or enter the port for shelter, carefully consider the bottom quality and surrounding conditions of the typhoon-resistant anchorage, appropriately adjust the berths of each ship in the port, and promptly grasp the progress of each ship so as to issue instructions and orders. After receiving the order, the captains of each ship should take measures in time to respond to changes. The heads of each department on the ship are respectively responsible for checking the typhoon prevention equipment on the ship, and constantly supervise and inspect the ship, continuously educating the crew members to abide by the technical operating procedures, strengthen the management of cargo accumulation, and fully pay attention to the ship's stability to maintain the ship's good technical condition. At the shelter anchorage, in order to enable the ships to avoid in time during navigation and reduce non-productive berthing, it is also necessary to carry out the survey of the typhoon shelter anchorage, select a good shelter anchorage, and adjust and unify the berths of all the shelter anchorages, and dispatch and allocate them according to the performance and size of the ships, so as to avoid unnecessary occupation of large ship berths by small ships.

In the past few years, we have deeply realized in the typhoon prevention work that to prevent the losses caused by typhoons, we must always carefully study and grasp the meteorological situation and do all the typhoon prevention preparation work. Therefore, we must pay attention to listening to our country's weather reports, constantly analyze and study them, and take measures in time. However, it should be pointed out that some of the typhoons that strike South China, because their place of origin is close to the South China Sea, often have the danger of sudden attacks. Therefore, we cannot relax our vigilance because the meteorological station has not issued a warning. Ships must always pay attention to typhoon omens during navigation and rely on on-site observations in order to take correct typhoon prevention measures in time.

Defending against typhoon disasters is a very arduous and tense struggle, but as long as we can closely rely on the masses, give play to the wisdom of the masses, raise vigilance, and continuously improve and improve typhoon prevention work, it is entirely possible to overcome typhoons.

    战胜海上运输的大敌——台风
    广州海运管理局海务监督室主任  张毓新
    台风一直是海上运输最凶恶的故人。在亚洲东部海洋上发生的台风，每年平均约有二十二次左右，发生次数为世界各地之冠，而且波及的范围很广，风力强度也很猛烈，台风中心附近的最大风力往往在十二级以上，具有很大破坏性。每年夏秋两季，从五月到十一月，台风常向我国沿海袭来，特别是华南沿海地区，常因没有及时得到警报突然遭受台风侵袭。
    解放以前，由于广大人民缺乏科学知识和防御台风的常识，加之当时的反动政府对人民的生命财产漠不关心，所以沿海地区每当遇到台风侵袭，人民的生命财产就遭到非常重大的损失。例如：一九一五年七月台风中心经过乍浦时，上海吴淞口沉船二十六艘，黄浦江发现浮尸二百多具，房屋树木倒塌拆毁无数。一九二二年台风袭击汕头时，引起海啸，除物资损失无法估计外，淹死的人约有五万多。台风的猛烈，即使几万吨的巨轮也往往受到巨大的损害。如一九三七年九月台风袭击香港时，在风暴最紧张的四小时内，仅大型海轮搁浅座礁的就达二十八艘，其中还包括多艘大邮船。从这些实例中，可以看出台风的危害性是多么的严重。过去的反动政府对于台风灾害也如对待其他天然灾害一样，非但束手无策，置人民生死于不顾，而且借口救灾乘机向人民大肆搜刮，更加重了沿海人民的灾难。
    解放几年来，我们在党和毛主席的关怀下，依靠群众智慧，运用了各种预测气象的科学仪器和防台设备，建立了正规的气象预报制度，采取了各种有效的预防措施，创造和推广了许多先进的方法，坚决同台风作斗争，使海上船舶和沿海地区遭受台风灾害的损失一年比一年显著地减少了。担负海上运输的船舶和海员们，几年来更是站在同台风英勇斗争的最前哨，涌现了很多战胜台风的英雄船舶和人物。如：南海一六三轮一九五三年十月在海口，南海一七四轮一九五四年八月在湛江，都战胜了当地数十年来罕见的台风，维护了船舶的安全，曾获得交通部海运管理总局的表扬和奖励。
    根据历年来我们在华南海上运输的防台工作实际体验，要做好这项工作，首先在组织上必须设立一个坚强的领导核心，统一领导全面的防台准备工作。我局的防台指挥部门，是由调度、监督、机务、政治、通讯等部门组成，业务局长作总指挥，统一领导和调度华南海上运输船舶，并同海洋气象台取得密切的联系和配合，使船、岸充分发挥职能作用。船上各业务部门在船长统一领导下，分别按职责执行自己的任务。在接得台风警报后，船长就召开全体船员大会，进行动员，并根据本船具体情况，交代防台注意事项；船上党支部则召开党、团员会议，号召党、团员在防台斗争中起带头作用和骨干作用；船上基层工会也及时在群众中展开宣传鼓动工作。这是战胜台风的重要保证。如上述南海一六三、一七四两轮，由于组织工作坚强，群众发动得好，在台风最紧张阶段，岸上拔树塌屋，公路桥梁摧毁，但船员们在狂风骇涛倾盆大雨中，仍各自坚持岗位同台风英勇搏斗，终于战胜了台风，没有遭受什么损失。在平时，也要加强对船员们进行政治教育，使船员树立起主人翁感觉。在每年台风季节来临前，更要组织全体船员学习防台知识，以提高船员防台的技术水平。特别是要使船员们在思想上提高警惕，克服麻痹冒险和对防台工作“怕麻烦”的情绪。
    其次在技术上必须熟练地掌握和分析气象情况，正确判断台风的中心方位、距离和移动方向，采取一切防台措施和避台驾驶法，以躲避台风为主，进行防台。防台总指挥部当台风在海洋上形成后，就应同气象台等单位密切联系，掌握各方面的情况，以百倍的警惕注视台风的发展趋势。当台风威胁转为明显时，根据台风发展及船舶的位置性能，及时调度避离或入港避风，周密考虑抗台锚地的底质和周围情况，适当调整港内各船的泊位，及时掌握各船的进行情况，以便发出指示和命令。各船长收到命令后，及时采取措施随机应变。船上各部负责人，分别负责检查船上有关防台的设备，并经常对船舶进行监督检查，不断教育船员遵守技术操作规程，加强货物积儎的管理，充分注意船身稳度，以保持船舶良好的技术状态。在避风锚地上，为了能使船舶于航行中及时躲避，减少非生产性停泊，还要进行防台避风锚地勘察工作，选择好避风锚地，并将所有的避风锚地的泊位进行调整和统一划分，按船舶性能和大小进行调度分配，以免小船不必要的占用大船锚位。
    几年来，我们在防台工作中，深深体会到要防止台风所造成的损失，必须经常认真研究掌握气象情况，做好一切防台准备工作，因此平时必须注意收听我国的气象报告，经常进行分析和研究，及时采取措施。但应该指出，袭击华南的一部分台风，因其产生地靠近南海，往往会有突然袭来的危险，因此不能因气象台没有警告而放松警惕。船舶航行必须经常注意台风预兆，依靠现场观测，以便及时采取正确的防台措施。
    防御台风灾害是一种非常艰苦而紧张的斗争，但只要我们能够紧紧依靠群众，发挥群众智慧，提高警惕，不断提高和改进防台工作，是完全有可能战胜台风的。
