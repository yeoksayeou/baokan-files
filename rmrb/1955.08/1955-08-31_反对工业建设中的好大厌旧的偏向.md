    Oppose the Tendency of Favoring the Big and Disliking the Old in Industrial Construction
    Liao Jili
    In order to successfully complete our country's first Five-Year Plan and lay the initial foundation for our country's socialist industrialization, we must oppose the tendency of favoring the big and disliking the old in industrial construction. This tendency is manifested in two aspects: On the one hand, some staff members of agencies and enterprises in industrial construction are fond of the big and dislike the small. They believe that only large enterprises can make my country's industrial production universally high, hoping for large-scale and modern everywhere; for small and medium-sized enterprises, they think that they are dispensable and of little significance, unwilling to build small and medium-sized enterprises, or adopt a passive resistance attitude towards the construction of small and medium-sized enterprises. On the other hand, some staff members of agencies and enterprises in industrial construction are fond of the new and dislike the old. They believe that to expand production and meet the growing material needs of society, the only way is to rely on newly built enterprises. Only newly built enterprises can improve my country's industrial production and complete the tasks stipulated in the national plan; for the original enterprises, they believe that the equipment is already old and the potential has been exhausted, unwilling to actively strengthen management, strive to improve production, and attach importance to the technical transformation of the original enterprises. These manifestations are all due to the lack of correct understanding and correct handling of the coordinated development of large and small and medium-sized enterprises, and newly built and original enterprises.
    So, how to correctly understand the coordinated development of large and small and medium-sized enterprises?
    We know that socialist industrialization is the main body of the general task of our country's transition period, and the basic link of socialist industrialization is to prioritize the development of heavy industry. Only by developing heavy industry can we lay the material foundation for our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation. The basic task of our country's first Five-Year Plan first stipulates that "concentrate major forces to carry out industrial construction with the 156 units designed by the Soviet Union to help my country as the center, and the 694 construction units with limits, and establish the initial foundation of our country's socialist industrialization." The vast majority of the 694 construction units with limits are large enterprises. These large enterprises are equipped with the most advanced technology; they concentrate a large amount of production capacity, materials, and labor resources within an enterprise, which can more effectively and economically utilize all major production factors - machinery and equipment, materials, and labor, and can ensure high labor productivity and low cost; they are all built according to the needs of our development of the national economy, and most of them are heavy industry. Concentrating major forces to build these large enterprises can establish our country's strong heavy industry foundation, establish a strong iron and steel industry, machine industry, electric power industry, coal industry, petroleum industry, non-ferrous metal industry, basic chemical industry, etc., and mass-produce various new equipment to open up roads for the continuous development and prosperity of the national economy; can transform agriculture, improve agricultural production, supply agriculture with tractors and other modern agricultural machines, supply agriculture with more chemical fertilizers and other means of production, and greatly develop agricultural production; can produce modern weapons to defend the motherland and further strengthen national defense forces; can produce modern transportation tools and transportation materials such as airplanes, automobiles, locomotives, and ships, and continuously develop our country's transportation industry; can continuously improve our scientific and technological achievements, ensure the rapid growth of socialist production, and ensure the continuous improvement of the people's material and cultural life.
    However, concentrating forces to build large enterprises does not mean that we can ignore the coordination of small and medium-sized enterprises and relax the corresponding development of some necessary small and medium-sized enterprises. We know that although large enterprises are the backbone of industry, that is, the main body of industry, without the collaboration and coordination of small and medium-sized enterprises, large enterprises cannot develop smoothly. For example, to build a large automobile manufacturing plant, there must be parts factories, glass factories, tire factories, leather factories, and hundreds of small and medium-sized factories to cooperate with it in order to carry out automobile production. To build a new industrial base, there must also be power stations, coal mines, machine repair plants, cement plants, brick and tile factories, etc. Some of these are large enterprises, and some are small and medium-sized enterprises; in this base, in addition to building large enterprises, it is also necessary to build some small and medium-sized enterprises accordingly. Some of them supply raw materials for large factories, some of them process for large factories, and some of them use the waste materials and by-products of large factories for production. Therefore, building some necessary small and medium-sized enterprises to cooperate with large enterprises is a necessary condition for building large enterprises. On the other hand, we know that the large enterprises currently built in our country are mainly heavy industry enterprises, which generally require a considerable amount of time and a large amount of funds to build. For example, to build a steel plant with an annual output of 1.5 million tons requires 1.8 billion yuan of funds and about seven years; to build a coal mine with an annual output of 900,000 tons requires more than 50 million yuan of funds and five or six years; to build an automobile factory with an annual output of 30,000 heavy-duty trucks requires more than 500 million yuan of funds and about five years. Before these large enterprises are built or only building these large enterprises is not enough to meet the diverse needs of the majority of urban people and make our country's economy reach a universal high. In this way, it is also necessary to appropriately build small and medium-sized enterprises. The construction time of small and medium-sized enterprises is generally shorter, they can be put into production quickly, and the funds required are relatively small, and they can play a significant role in meeting the industrial products needed for the production and life of the majority of people, and in rapidly accumulating construction funds for the country. Furthermore, in order to make the allocation of productive forces more balanced and reasonable, accelerate the economic development of various backward areas and various minority areas, and considering national defense security, it is also necessary to appropriately build small and medium-sized enterprises. Because to make the allocation of productive forces more balanced and reasonable, it is necessary to make industrial enterprises close to raw material producing areas and consumption areas, so that the distribution of industry can achieve rational and balanced development; at the same time, make each economic zone develop comprehensively in economy, and make industry and agriculture form a strong foundation. And small and medium-sized enterprises are the easiest to take materials locally and consume locally, which is suitable for this aspect. As for considering national defense security, so that our country's industrial production will not be interrupted and interrupted due to the impact of war, it is also necessary to build small and medium-sized enterprises, because small and medium-sized enterprises are relatively dispersed, and under the conditions of modern warfare, they are relatively easy to protect and continue production.
    Of course, the above-mentioned appropriate construction of small and medium-sized enterprises should never be carried out regardless of priority, side by side, and must be carried out in a planned manner under the implementation of the national key construction policy and under the national supply and marketing balance. Only in this way can it be beneficial to the cause of socialist construction.
    So, how to correctly understand the coordinated development of newly built enterprises and original enterprises?
    We know that our country's industrial base is very weak, and it is difficult to build a socialist society with the existing foundation alone. We must carry out many new industrial constructions in order to lay the material foundation for our country's socialist society. During the first Five-Year Plan period, the 694 units above the limit and 2,300 units below the limit in industrial construction were all newly built and expanded enterprises. When these new enterprises are built, our country's economic landscape will undergo major changes.
    However, vigorously building new enterprises does not mean not developing original enterprises, or that it is not necessary to fully play the role of original enterprises. On the contrary, we must make full use of the original industrial base and industrial enterprises in order to build new enterprises.
    Why do we say this? First, making full use of the original industrial base is a necessary condition for realizing national industrialization. Our country's first Five-Year Plan stipulates that new construction, expansion, and reconstruction should be carried out on the existing basis, because: to ensure the completion of the country's large-scale construction tasks in a very short period of time, we need to maximize the use of existing favorable conditions in terms of geological resources, technical equipment, technical strength, raw material supply, and transportation, and to make full use of existing favorable conditions, we must start from the existing industrial base and existing industrial enterprises, only in this way can we speed up the construction and rapidly improve the production capacity; on the other hand, to achieve the purpose of greatly saving national construction funds and rapidly exerting the effect of national investment, to cultivate technical strength for preparing to build new bases and new enterprises, and to create conditions for supporting new bases and new enterprises, we must also make full use of the original industrial base and the original industrial enterprises. Our country's Five-Year Plan stipulates that the full use of the original industrial base in Northeast China and the full use of existing enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel Company for construction, its role lies in this.
    Second, in order to meet the industrial products needed by the people in urban and rural areas across the country, we must also fully exert the potential of existing industrial production. During the first Five-Year Plan period, the completion of our country's industrial production tasks mainly relied on the production of various original industries. During the first Five-Year Plan period, the vast majority of the country's total industrial output value was produced by original industrial enterprises. Even by 1957, the country's total industrial output value increased by nearly one time compared with 1952, and about 70% of the increased part was produced by the increased production of original industries, while newly built industries only accounted for about 30% of the increased part.
    Third, in order to support national construction, we must also make full use of the strength of existing enterprises. The development of existing enterprises is the material basis for the country's large-scale construction. In the Five-Year Plan, the main equipment of the 145 units designed by the Soviet Union to help our country and under construction is supplied by the Soviet Union, but many secondary equipment and a large amount of building materials required must be produced and supplied domestically. In addition to the construction units helped by the Soviet Union, there are also 549 construction units above the limit and 2,300 construction units below the limit in the industrial field, as well as railway transportation, postal and telecommunications construction, agriculture, forestry and water conservancy construction, financial, financial and trade construction, and cultural, educational and health construction, etc., all of which must rely on domestic supply of building materials, machinery and equipment, and tools and instruments. To meet the needs of the above aspects, the most important thing is to rely on the support of existing enterprises.
    Fourth, existing industrial enterprises are also an indispensable department for cultivating and increasing the country's technical strength. Relying on existing enterprises can cultivate the technical talents needed by newly built industrial and mining enterprises, that is, cultivate them to learn new technologies, master new equipment, and produce new products; can cultivate the technical talents of existing industrial and mining enterprises to strive to improve technical level, trial-produce and produce new types of products, and improve product quality; furthermore, with the expansion of the scale of national basic construction and the increase in technical strength required, it can also cultivate the technical strength needed to serve national construction from existing industrial enterprises.
    Fifth, existing industrial enterprises are also the most important source for providing a large amount of funds for national construction. As pointed out by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, there are four sources of national construction fund accumulation, but with the development of national industrial enterprises, especially the development of state-owned industrial enterprises, industrial enterprise profit income has become the main source of national construction fund accumulation. According to our country's 1954 financial settlement and 1955 financial budget, the profit income of state-owned enterprises has exceeded industrial and commercial tax revenue and ranked first in the country's fiscal revenue, and the profit income of state-owned industrial enterprises ranks first in the total profit income of state-owned enterprises. With the future development of industrial production, the profit income of state-owned industrial enterprises will greatly increase. Therefore, fully developing existing industrial production will continuously provide a large amount of funds for large-scale national construction.
    Of course, to develop our country's existing industrial production, we must proceed according to the national balance and overall consideration policy, combined with the specific situation of supply, production, and sales. In other words: for industrial production that has no problems in terms of raw materials, sales, technology, etc., we should strive to improve production, improve the quality and quantity of products, and strive to overfulfill the national plan; for industrial production that is restricted by raw materials, we should strive to save raw materials and research substitutes to increase production; for industrial production that is restricted by technology, we should strive to improve technology, research, trial-produce, and produce products needed in all aspects, and strive to complete the trial production and production plan of new products.
    In this way, it seems that we must correctly solve the problem of the coordinated development of large and small and medium-sized enterprises, newly built enterprises and original enterprises in industry from ideological understanding and in actual work. Both of these aspects are components of the socialist industrial system. Large enterprises and newly built enterprises are the main body of our country's economic construction, and concentrating forces to develop them is in line with the long-term interests of the Chinese people. However, newly built small and medium-sized enterprises and original enterprises should not be ignored. They are our realistic foundation and the main source for currently supporting national construction, accumulating construction funds, and meeting the people's needs for industrial products. The erroneous tendency of favoring the big and disliking the small, favoring the new and disliking the old, and ignoring small and medium-sized enterprises and original enterprises must be systematically criticized. We must further recognize that socialist industry is an organic whole, which is composed of many large, medium, and small enterprises and new and old enterprises in various industrial production departments. They are all interdependent and interconnected, which requires overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement for all industrial enterprises under the national supply, production, and sales balance, mutual connection and cooperation, so that they can develop in a planned and proportional manner. Only focusing on large enterprises and not small and medium-sized enterprises, only focusing on newly built enterprises and not original enterprises, will cause the national plan to be disjointed and mutually contradictory. Only all large and small and medium-sized enterprises, newly built enterprises and original enterprises work together to complete the national plan can we guarantee the development of national industrial production. Therefore, the staff and workers in large enterprises and newly built enterprises should not only recognize the importance of their own work positions, strive to improve their political and cultural level, ensure the quality of construction projects, strive to put them into production ahead of schedule, and learn to master new equipment and new technologies, and produce a large number of new products for the country; the staff and workers in small and medium-sized enterprises and original enterprises should also recognize that their work positions are responsible for important tasks of the country, and must strive to improve their political and cultural level, continuously research and improve technology, trial-produce and produce new products that meet the needs of the country and the people, and complete and overfulfill the national plan on time. Only in this way can we successfully complete and overfulfill our country's first Five-Year Plan and establish the initial foundation of our country's socialist industrialization.

    反对工业建设中的好大厌旧的偏向
    廖季立
    为了胜利地完成我国第一个五年计划，打下我国社会主义工业化的初步基础，我们必须反对工业建设中的好大厌旧的偏向。这种偏向，一方面表现在有些机关和企业的工作人员在工业建设中喜大厌小，他们认为只有大企业才能使我国工业生产普遍高涨，希望处处大规模、处处现代化；对于中小企业则认为可有可无、意义不大，不愿意建设中小企业，或者对中小企业的建设采取消极抵抗态度。另一方面表现在有些机关和企业的工作人员在工业建设中喜新厌旧，他们认为要扩大生产，满足社会日益增长的物质需要，唯一的办法就是依靠新建企业，只有新建企业才能提高我国工业生产，完成国家计划所规定的任务；对于原有企业则认为设备已经陈旧，潜力已经挖光，不愿再去积极加强管理，努力提高生产和重视原有企业的技术改造。这些表现，都是由于对大企业和中小企业、新建企业和原有企业的配合发展问题缺乏正确的认识和正确的处理所发生的。
    那末，怎样去正确认识大企业和中小企业的配合发展问题？
    我们知道，社会主义工业化是我国过渡时期总任务的主体，而社会主义工业化的基本环节，就是优先发展重工业。只有发展重工业才能为我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造打下物质基础。我国第一个五年计划的基本任务，首先规定“集中主要力量进行以苏联帮助我国设计的一五六个单位为中心的、由限额以上的六九四个建设单位组成的工业建设，建立我国的社会主义工业化的初步基础。”限额以上的六百九十四个建设单位，绝大多数都是大企业。这些大企业都是用最先进的技术装备起来；都是把大量的生产能力、物资和劳动力资源集中在一个企业之内，能更有效、更经济地利用一切主要生产要素——机器设备、材料和劳动力，能保证高度的劳动生产率和低廉的成本；都是根据我们发展国民经济的需要来建设的，其中绝大部分是重工业。集中主要力量建设这些大企业，就可以建立我国强大的重工业基础，建立起强大的钢铁工业、机器工业、电力工业、煤炭工业、石油工业、有色金属工业、基本化学工业等等，大量生产各种新式设备，为国民经济的不断发展和繁荣开辟道路；就可以改造农业，提高农业生产，供给农业以拖拉机和其他现代化的农业机器，供给农业更多的化学肥料和其他生产资料，使农业生产得到大力发展；就可以生产现代化的武器，以保卫祖国，进一步加强国防力量；就可以生产飞机、汽车、火车头、轮船等现代化的交通运输工具和交通运输器材，不断发展我国的运输事业；就可以使我们的科学和技术成就不断提高，保证社会主义生产迅速增长，保证人民的物质生活和文化生活不断提高。
    但是，集中力量建设大企业，并不是说可以不重视中小企业的配合和放松一些必要的中小企业的相应发展。我们知道，大企业虽然是工业中的骨干，即工业中的主体，但如果没有中小企业的协作和配合，大企业就不能顺利发展。例如建设一个大的汽车制造厂，就必须有附件厂、玻璃厂、轮胎厂、皮革厂、以及需要有上百个中小工厂同它相配合，才能进行汽车的生产。建设一个新的工业基地，也必须有电站、煤矿、机器修理厂、水泥厂、砖瓦厂等等，这些有的是大企业，有些则是中小企业；在这个基地上，除了建设大企业之外，还必须相应地建设一些中小企业，它们有的为大工厂供应原材料，有的为大工厂进行加工，有的则是利用大工厂的废料、副产品而进行生产。因此，建设一些必要的中小企业同大企业配合协作，是建设大企业所必不可少的条件。另一方面，我们知道，目前我国建设的大企业，主要是重工业企业，这些企业，一般都需要相当长的时间和大量的资金，才能建设起来。例如建设一个年产一百五十万吨的钢铁厂，需要十八亿元的资金和七年左右的时间；建设一个年产九十万吨的煤矿需要五千多万元的资金和五、六年的时间；建设一个年产载重汽车三万辆的汽车厂需要五亿多元的资金和五年左右的时间。在这些大企业没有建成之前或者只建设这些大企业，还不足以满足当前广大城市人民多种多样的需要，使我国经济达到普遍的高涨。这样，适当地建设中小企业，也就有必要了。建设中小企业的时间一般比较短，能很快投入生产，需要的资金也比较少，而对于满足广大人民的生产和生活所需要的工业品，以及为国家迅速积累建设资金都能起着重大的作用。再就是，为了使生产力的配置更加均衡、合理，加速发展各个落后地区和各个少数民族地区的经济，并考虑到国防上的安全，也必须适当地建设中小企业。因为要使生产力的配置更加均衡、合理，就必须使工业企业接近原料产地和消费地区，使工业的分布达到合理和均衡地发展；同时使各经济区在经济上能够综合地发展，使工业和农业结成一个强大的基础。而中小企业是最容易就地取材，就地消费，适合这方面需要的。至于从国防上的安全考虑，使我国的工业生产不因遭受战争的影响而发生停顿和中断，那也要建设中小企业，因为中小企业比较分散，在现代战争的条件下，它们是比较便于防护和继续进行生产的。
    当然，上面所说的要适当地建设中小企业，决不应该不分主次，齐头并进，必须在贯彻国家重点建设的方针下，在全国供产销平衡下，有计划地进行。只有这样，才能有利于社会主义建设事业。
    那末，又怎样去正确认识新建企业和原有企业的配合发展问题？
    我们知道，我国工业基础非常薄弱，光凭现有基础是很难建成社会主义社会的。必须进行许许多多新的工业建设，我们才能替我国社会主义社会打下物质基础。在第一个五年计划期间，工业建设限额以上的六百九十四个单位和限额以下的单位二千三百个，都是新建和扩建的企业。当这些新的企业建设起来之后，我国的经济面貌将发生重大的改变。
    但是，大力建设新企业，不是说不发展原有企业，或者可以不必充分发挥原有企业的作用。恰恰相反，我们必须充分利用原有工业基地和工业企业，才能建设起新企业。
    为什么这样说呢？第一、充分利用原有工业基础，是实现国家工业化的必要条件。我国第一个五年计划规定在现有基础上进行新建、扩建和改建，是因为：要保证在极短时间内完成国家的大规模建设任务，需要我们最大限度地利用现有的地质资源、技术设备、技术力量、原料供应、以及交通运输等各方面的有利条件，而充分利用现有的有利条件，就必须从现有的工业基地和现有的工业企业建设着手，只有这样才能加快建设的速度和迅速提高生产能力；另一方面，要达到大大节约国家建设资金和迅速发挥国家投资效果的目的，要为准备建设新基地和新企业培养技术力量和为支援新基地、新企业创造条件，也必须充分利用原有的工业基地和原有的工业企业。我国五年计划规定充分利用东北原有的工业基地，充分利用鞍钢等现有企业进行建设，其作用即在于此。
    第二、为了满足全国城乡人民所需要的工业产品，也必须充分发挥现有工业生产的潜在力量。在第一个五年计划期内，我国工业生产任务的完成，最主要的还是依靠原有各种工业的生产，第一个五年计划期间，全国工业总产值中绝大多数是由原有工业企业生产的，即至一九五七年，全国工业总产值比一九五二年增加将近一倍，增加的部分约有百分之七十左右是原有工业增产的，新建工业仅占增产部分的百分之三十左右。
    第三、为了支援国家的建设，也必须充分利用现有企业的力量。现有企业的发展是国家进行大规模建设的物质基础。在五年计划中，苏联帮助我国设计而进行施工的一百四十五个单位，其主要设备都是由苏联供应的，但是许多次要的设备以及所需的大量建筑材料，都必须由国内生产供应。除苏联帮助的建设单位而外，在工业方面还有五百四十九个限额以上的建设单位和二千三百个限额以下的建设单位，以及铁路交通邮电建设、农林水利建设、财政金融贸易建设和文化教育卫生建设等等，也都必须依靠国内供应建筑材料、机器设备和工具仪器。要满足上述各方面的需要，最主要的就是要依靠现有企业的支援。
    第四、现有工业企业又是培养和增长国家技术力量不可缺少的部门。依靠现有企业，可以培养新建工矿企业所需要的技术人才，即培养他们学习新的技术，掌握新的设备，生产新的产品；可以培养现有工矿企业的技术人才，为提高技术水平、试制和生产新种类产品、以及为改进产品质量而努力；再就是随着国家基本建设规模的扩大和需要技术力量的增加，也可以从现有工业企业中培养为国家建设服务所需要的技术力量。
    第五、现有工业企业又是为国家建设提供大量资金的最重要的泉源。国家建设资金的积累，正如李富春副总理所指出的，有四大来源，但随着全国工业企业的发展，特别是国营工业企业的发展，工业企业利润收入就成为国家积累建设资金的主要来源。根据我国一九五四年财政决算和一九五五年财政预算看来，国营企业利润收入已超过工商税收而占国家财政收入的第一位，而国营工业企业利润的收入又占全部国营企业利润收入的第一位。随着今后工业生产的发展，国营工业企业的利润收入将会大大增加。因此，充分发展现有工业生产，将为国家大规模建设不断提供大量资金。
    当然，发展我国现有工业生产，必须根据全国平衡、统筹兼顾的方针，结合供产销的具体情况来进行。换句话说，就是：凡在原料、销路、技术等各方面没有问题的工业生产，应当努力提高生产，提高产品的质量和数量，努力争取超额完成国家计划；凡原料受到限制的工业生产，应当努力节约原材料和研究代用品，以增加生产；凡受到技术限制的工业生产，应当努力提高技术，研究试制和生产各方面需要的产品，努力完成新产品试制和生产计划。
    这样看来，我们必须从思想认识上和在实际工作中来正确解决工业上的大企业和中小企业、新建企业和原有企业的配合发展问题。这两个方面都是社会主义工业体系的组成部分。大企业和新建企业是我国经济建设的主体，集中力量发展它们是符合中国人民长远利益的。但是新建的中小企业和原有企业也不容忽视。它们是我们现实的基础，是当前支援国家建设、积累建设资金和满足人民工业品需要的主要泉源。对于那种喜大厌小、喜新厌旧，忽视中小企业、忽视原有企业的错误偏向，必须给以系统的批判。必须进一步认识，社会主义工业是一个有机的整体，它是由各工业生产部门的许许多多大中小企业和新旧企业所组成的。它们都是互相依存和互相联系的，这就要求对一切工业企业在全国供产销平衡下，统筹兼顾、全面安排，互相衔接配合，使之有计划按比例地发展。只顾大企业不顾中小企业，只顾新建企业不顾原有企业，就会使国家计划发生互相脱节和互相抵触的现象。只有一切大企业和中小企业、新建企业和原有企业一齐努力完成国家计划，才能保证国家工业生产的发展。因此，大企业和新建企业中的职工，不但应该认识到自己工作岗位的重要性，努力提高政治、文化水平，保证建设工程的质量，争取提前投入生产，学会掌握新设备和新技术，为国家生产大量的新产品；在中小企业和原有企业的职工，同样应该认识到自己的工作岗位担负着国家重要的任务，必须努力提高政治、文化水平，不断地研究和改进技术，试制和生产合乎国家和人民需要的新产品，按时完成和超额完成国家计划。只有这样，才能胜利地完成和超额完成我国第一个五年计划，建立起我国社会主义工业化的初步基础。
