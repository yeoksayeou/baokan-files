Recently, this reporter visited a fighter jet unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force. The commanders and fighters of this unit shot down or damaged five Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes in three air battles not long ago. What is recorded here are the stories of these three air battles.

Hitting Hard at Chiang Bandit Jet Fighters

At a little after 4:00 PM on July 4th, pilots Chen Taiqu, Wang Zhaoquan, and two other pilots took off in their war eagles.

The brave war eagles advanced while searching for the enemy. Soon, a command came from ground control via radio: "The enemy is to your left front, at a height of 4,000 meters. Search carefully!" Flight leader Chen Taiqu immediately led the squadron to search for the Chiang bandit planes coming from the east. Everyone spotted them: at a distance of more than 8,000 meters, there were a total of four Chiang bandit F-84 fighter jets. In order not to be detected by the enemy, Chen Taiqu, according to the previously agreed-upon signal, waggled his wings and then led his comrades, speeding up and circling behind the enemy planes, taking good attacking positions.

Chen Taiqu and Wang Zhaoquan each kept a close watch on an enemy plane, and with the cover of the other two war eagles, bravely pursued the enemy planes. The enemy plane in Chen Taiqu's sights grew bigger and clearer. Chen Taiqu did not immediately fire at the enemy. He continued to pursue the enemy plane calmly and cleverly, determined to get closer and strike a heavy blow.

When the brave war eagle was only a little more than 400 meters away from the enemy plane, the enemy finally realized that our plane was attacking from behind. They tried to escape, but it was already too late. In that instant, Chen Taiqu opened fire. Red tracer bullets hit the enemy plane squarely. After a continuous barrage, the enemy plane trailed black smoke and crashed into the sea fifteen kilometers southeast of Beishuang Island. At that moment, Chen Taiqu pulled the control stick, raising his war eagle, and ordered Wang Zhaoquan to attack.

At this time, Wang Zhaoquan opened fire at an enemy plane he was chasing. However, this enemy plane cunningly and desperately reduced its altitude and made S-shaped flights to avoid the shells fired by our plane. Wang Zhaoquan's first shot missed. At this time, he heard the familiar and powerful voice from the flight leader: "Aim again, get closer, hit hard! I'll cover you!" So, Wang Zhaoquan approached the enemy even more bravely, from 300 meters to 150 meters, and from the sights he could clearly see the numbers on the enemy plane. Wang Zhaoquan carried out two more consecutive attacks, finally damaging the enemy plane.

Air Commander

One day, at a little after 9:00 AM. Air commander Zhang Wenqing led a small squadron of war eagles to complete a patrol mission. Just as they were about to return to base, Zhang Wenqing heard an urgent order from the ground commander through his headphones: two enemy planes had sneaked into the airspace over the Taishan Islands, at a height of 6,000 meters. Go and destroy them quickly!

Zhang Wenqing immediately led his squadron straight to the airspace over the Taishan Islands. At a distance of 8,000 to 9,000 meters, Liu Huachun, the wingman pilot of Zhang Wenqing, first spotted two Chiang bandit F-84 jet fighters flying towards the mainland.

Zhang Wenqing led the war eagles, deployed their formation, and pursued the enemy. When they were about to approach the enemy planes, the enemy detected them. Obviously, the enemy knew they were at a disadvantage, so they dared not engage and only cared about escaping. Zhang Wenqing decisively decided to launch a surprise attack. He ordered third flight leader Wang Hongxi: "You attack, I'll cover you!"

Wang Hongxi stepped on the accelerator and closely followed an enemy plane, opening fire on it. But the enemy plane cunningly made a sharp turn, causing Wang Hongxi to miss. At this time, Zhang Wenqing saw clearly, and under the cover of his wingman, immediately raised his war eagle, flew above an enemy plane, and waggled his wings, tempting the enemy. Sure enough, the Chiang bandit pilot could not hold back and was forced to suddenly make an irregular right turn. But this was exactly what they wanted, and Wang Hongxi suddenly fired a burst of intense fire, hitting the two wings of the enemy plane, causing them to emit black smoke, followed by flames.

"Hit! Hit!" Wang Hongxi excitedly reported to Zhang Wenqing. Zhang Wenqing also congratulated him: "Well done!" At this time, Wang Hongxi was still closely following the enemy plane, and personally watched the enemy pilot throw off the plane's cockpit cover, but before this guy had time to parachute, the plane exploded in mid-air. Then, Wang Hongxi turned back to cover Zhang Wenqing and badly damaged the second Chiang bandit plane.

The Fourth Red Star

On this very day, just as the people at the airport were celebrating the victory of Zhang Wenqing's squadron, Wang Kun's squadron of eagles took off again to fight.

Wang Kun had shot down or damaged three enemy planes in past air battles and had been awarded the First Class Merit. Therefore, on the left side of the cockpit of his war eagle, three red five-pointed stars were painted. When Wang Kun's squadron flew over the Mazu Strait, they happened to spot a Chiang bandit maritime patrol bomber. This enemy plane was large and slow-moving, and our pilots called it a "clumsy donkey." When Wang Kun's squadron's war eagles approached it, it opened fire.

Wang Kun pulled the control stick, raising his war eagle, and then further approached the enemy. At this time, the clumsy enemy plane knew that escape was impossible, so it spun in small circles, firing machine guns, and desperately reduced its altitude, trying to skim the surface of the sea to slip away, avoiding the cannon fire. At this time, Wang Kun tried his best to reduce the altitude of his flight, kept a little distance away, and narrowed the angle of attack. He also ordered third flight leader Cheng Yusheng to fire at the enemy plane, forcing the enemy to meet the attack, creating a favorable attacking situation. In this way, Wang Kun agilely circled behind the enemy plane and hit the enemy plane's fuselage hard. The enemy plane, emitting thick smoke, was immediately forced to land near the lighthouse on Baiquan Island.

This battle only took seven minutes. Wang Kun and his comrades drove their victorious war eagles and safely returned to the airport. In the evening, everyone gathered to celebrate the victory of the day. A fourth, shining red star was painted on Wang Kun's war eagle.

    战斗在祖国天空的战鹰
    新华社记者　姜庆肇
    最近，记者访问了中国人民解放军空军某歼击机部队。这支部队的指战员们在不久以前的三次空战中，打落打伤了五架蒋贼飞机。这里记述的就是这三次空战的故事。
    痛击蒋贼喷气战斗机
    七月四日下午四点多钟，飞行员陈太渠、王兆全和另外两个飞行员一起，驾着战鹰起飞了。
    勇敢的战鹰边前进边搜索敌人。不久，从无线电里传来地面指挥所的命令：“敌人就在你们左前方，高四千公尺，注意搜索！”长机飞行员陈太渠立刻带领机群搜索东来的蒋贼飞机。大家都发现了：在八千多公尺的距离上，一共有四架蒋贼F—八四型战斗机。陈太渠为了不让敌人发觉，根据原来约定的暗号，把机翼摇摆了一下，便带领战友们，加快速度，绕到敌机尾后，占好了攻击的位置。
    陈太渠和王兆全各人紧盯着一架敌机，在另外两架战鹰的掩护下勇猛地向敌机追去。敌机在陈太渠的瞄准具里越来越大，越来越清楚了。陈太渠没有立刻向敌人射击。他仍然沉着机敏地追逐着敌机，决心追得再近些，狠狠地打。
    当勇敢的战鹰离敌机只有四百多公尺的时候，敌机才发觉了我机正在从后面向它攻来。它们想逃跑，但已经来不及了。就在这一刹那间，陈太渠开火了。红色曳光弹正打到敌机身上。经过一阵连续的痛打后，这架敌机便拖着一股黑烟，坠落到北霜岛东南十五公里的海里去了。此刻，陈太渠一拉操纵杆，使战鹰升高，并命令王兆全进入攻击。
    王兆全这时向被他追逐着的一架敌机开了炮。可是，这架敌机狡猾地拚命降低高度和作S式的飞行，来躲避我机射出的炮弹。王兆全第一次的射击没有打中。这时，他听到从长机传来的那亲切有力的声音：“再瞄准，近些，狠狠打！我掩护你！”于是，王兆全更勇敢地接近了敌人，由三百公尺直到一百五十公尺，从瞄准具里已经能够清楚地看见敌机上的号码了。王兆全又连续进行了两次攻击，终于把这架敌机打伤了。
    空中指挥员
    有一天，上午九点多钟。空中指挥员张文清率领一小队战鹰完成了巡逻任务。当他们正要返航的时候，张文清从耳机里听到地面指挥员的紧急命令：两架敌机窜入台山列岛上空，高六千公尺，快去消灭它！
    张文清立刻率领机群直奔台山列岛上空。在距离八、九千公尺时，张文清的僚机飞行员刘华春便首先发现了正在向大陆方向飞来的两架蒋贼F—八四型喷气战斗机。
    张文清带领着战鹰们，摆开阵势，追逐着敌人。当他们就要接近敌机的时候，敌机发觉了。显然敌人已知占了下风，因而不敢迎战，只顾逃命。张文清当机立断地决定强袭敌人。他命令第三号长机飞行员王鸿喜：“你攻击，我掩护！”
    王鸿喜一加油门，就紧紧地跟上了一架敌机，并向它开了火。可是敌机狡猾地急转了一下弯，使王鸿喜没能打中它。这时，张文清看得很清楚，他在僚机的掩护下，立刻把战鹰升高，飞到一架敌机的上空，摇摆着机翼，诱惑敌人。果然，蒋贼飞行员沉不住气了，被迫突然间来了个不规律的右转弯。但这正好上了圈套，王鸿喜一下子射去一阵猛烈的炮火，就把这架敌机的两翼打得冒黑烟，接着又喷出了火苗来。
    “打中了！打中了！”王鸿喜兴奋地报告张文清。张文清也祝贺他：“打得好！”这时，王鸿喜还紧跟在敌机后面，亲眼看着敌人的飞行员扔掉了飞机上的座舱盖，但这家伙还没有来得及跳伞，飞机就在空中爆炸了，接着，王鸿喜又转回头来掩护张文清把第二架蒋贼飞机打成重伤。
    第四颗红星
    就在这一天，正当机场上的人们为张文清小队的胜利而欢乐时，王昆小队的雄鹰又起飞去作战了。
    王昆在过去的空战中，曾打落打伤三架敌机，立过一等功。因此，在他那只战鹰的座舱左边，涂着三颗红五星。当王昆小队飞临马祖海峡上空的时候，正好发现一架蒋贼的海上巡逻轰炸机。这架敌机很大，行动缓慢，我军飞行员都叫它“笨驴”。当王昆小队的战鹰逼近它的时候，它开火了。
    王昆紧拉操纵杆，使战鹰升高，接着便更进一步逼近敌人。这时，笨重的敌机知道逃跑是不成了，便一面旋转着小圆圈，用机关枪射击，一面拚命地降低高度，躲避着炮火，妄图贴着海面溜走。这时，王昆尽力地降低飞行的高度，隔远一点距离，缩小进攻的角度。并且命令三号长机飞行员程玉升向敌机开炮，迫使敌人迎战，造成有利的攻击形势。就这样，王昆敏捷地绕到敌机尾后，狠狠地打中了敌机的机身。冒着浓烟的敌机当即被迫降到白犬岛的灯塔附近去了。
    这一场战斗只花了七分钟。王昆和战友们驾着胜利的战鹰，安全地返回机场。晚上，大家集会欢庆这一天的胜利。王昆的战鹰又涂上了第四颗灿烂的红星。
