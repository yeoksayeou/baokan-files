Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 29th: The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently inspected the comprehensive conservation movement in Shanghai's industrial departments. On the 22nd, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of Party member cadres from all departments and public-private enterprises in the city. Ma Tianshui, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Committee, delivered a report on the inspection.

In his report, Ma Tianshui said that the comprehensive conservation movement in Shanghai has already begun and has achieved certain results. The quality of industrial products is generally improving. However, some enterprise cadres hold one-sided views on conservation, leading to a decline in product quality.

In his report, Ma Tianshui cited examples of the current lack of attention to product quality. For example, some cotton textile factories have not taken effective measures to address the difficulties caused by the recent increase in yellow flowers and impurities in raw cotton, resulting in an increase in cotton consumption per yarn and a decline in product quality. This is particularly prominent in the state-owned Shanghai No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory and No. 10 Cotton Textile Factory. Some cigarette factories superficially saved a lot of tobacco leaves in July, but these savings mainly came from insufficient cigarette weight and increased moisture content. This will inevitably reduce the quality of cigarettes. In terms of using substitute raw materials, much progress has been made in various aspects since last year, but this inspection found that some product quality was poor due to imperfect substitute measures. In some factories, substitute materials were adopted rashly even when they could harm quality. In some printing and dyeing factories, some cadres are complacent and conservative, rarely soliciting opinions from the masses or exchanging experiences with brother factories, resulting in some printed fabrics having dull colors and weak materials. In some pharmaceutical factories, sanitation work is not done well enough.

Ma Tianshui pointed out that practicing thrift is not a passive or temporary measure, but a fundamental method and active policy for building socialism. Currently, some departments and enterprise staff hold one-sided views on conservation, failing to start from improving enterprise management and strengthening political and ideological work, but simply adopting simple methods to complete conservation targets, resulting not only in greater waste, but also preventing the improvement of enterprise management and politically alienating them from the masses. Although these phenomena are individual and some are only just emerging, they must be corrected.

In his report, Ma Tianshui also cited examples of enterprises that focused on improving quality while also completing conservation targets. For example, the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, despite the poor quality of raw cotton and frequent changes in cotton blending components, was able to strengthen various measures based on the cotton blending situation at any time, and the cotton consumption per yarn in July did not exceed 385 jin, and all cotton yarn was of first-class quality. He pointed out that only by achieving comprehensive conservation on the premise of improving quality can the management level of enterprises be improved.

At this meeting of Party member cadres, Chen Pixian, Second Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, instructed the relevant industrial leadership departments and the Shanghai Municipal Industrial Committees of the Chinese Communist Party to conduct a serious inspection of the product quality issues and the implementation of comprehensive conservation in their affiliated enterprises in the near future. Factories producing similar products should frequently exchange experiences, and all factories must regularly solicit opinions from users on their products. At the same time, research on the use of substitute raw materials should continue to be actively promoted, but certain approval procedures must be followed before a decision is made to adopt them.

### 上海检查工业部门全面节约工作

　　上海检查工业部门全面节约工作
    新华社上海二十九日电　中共上海市委员会最近检查了上海市工业部门的全面节约运动。二十二日，中共上海市委员会召开全市各部门和公私营企业党员干部大会，由市委副书记马天水作了关于这次检查的报告。
    马天水在报告中说，目前上海市全面节约运动已经展开，有了一定的成绩。工业产品的质量，总的趋势是进步的。但有些企业的干部存在着片面的节约观点，以致产品的质量有了下降。
    马天水在报告中举出了目前存在的一些不重视产品质量的事例。如一部分棉纺织工厂，由于没有针对最近原棉中黄花多、含杂多所产生的困难而采取各种有效的措施，因此每件纱的用棉量增加，产品质量下降。特别是国营上海第四棉纺织厂和第十棉纺织厂较为突出。有的卷烟工厂七月份表面上节约了很多烟叶；但这些烟叶主要是从烟支份量不足和提高水份等方面得来的。这样势必降低了纸烟的质量。在采用代用原料方面，去年以来各方面作出了很多成绩，但经过这次检查发现也有因为代用的措施做得不完善以致产品质量不好的现象。还有个别工厂在采用代用品后要妨害质量的地方也轻率地采用了代用品。在部分印染工厂中，有的干部存在着自满保守情绪，很少征求群众意见或到兄弟厂去交流经验，致使有些花布的颜色不光彩，布料不结实。有的制药工厂中，卫生工作作得很不够。
    马天水指出，厉行节约不是消极的临时的措施，而是建设社会主义的根本方法和积极的方针。目前有些部门和企业的工作人员存在着片面的节约观点，不从提高企业管理水平和加强政治思想工作着手，而只是采取简单的做法来完成节约指标，结果不仅造成了更大的浪费，而且使企业管理水平不能提高，并在政治上脱离群众。虽然这些现象是个别的，有的只是刚发生的萌芽，但必须加以纠正。
    马天水在报告中同时举出了一些重视提高质量而又完成节约指标的企业的例子。如国营上海第二棉纺织厂，虽然原棉质量差而又经常变换配棉成分，但由于能随时根据配棉情况，加强各项措施，七月份每件纱的用棉量仍不超过三百八十五斤，全部棉纱都是一等一级的质量。他指出，只有在提高质量的前提下做到全面节约，才能提高企业的管理水平。
    在这次党员干部大会上，中共上海市委员会第二书记陈丕显指示各有关的工业领导部门和中共上海市各产业委员会，要在最近期内对所属企业产品质量问题和全面节约的贯彻情况作一次认真的检查。同类产品的工厂之间，要经常交流经验，所有工厂都必须经常向用户征求对产品的意见。同时，要继续地积极提倡研究采用代用原材料，但在决定采用前必须经过一定的批准手续。
