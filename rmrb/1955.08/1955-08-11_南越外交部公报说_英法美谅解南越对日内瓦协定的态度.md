Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 10th (dispatch): Saigon news: The South Vietnamese Foreign Ministry issued a communiqué on the evening of the 8th, denying newspaper reports that Britain, France, and the United States had put pressure on the South Vietnamese government to abide by the terms of the Geneva Accords.

The South Vietnamese Foreign Ministry communiqué stated that the Western three powers have a clear understanding of South Vietnam's attitude toward the Geneva Accords. It implied that Britain, France, and the United States sympathize with South Vietnam's failure to hold consultations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam starting from July 20th, as stipulated by the Geneva Accords.

It is well known that the South Vietnamese authorities bear an inescapable responsibility for the implementation of the Geneva Accords. As previously reported, Indian Prime Minister Nehru said in the Indian People's Assembly on July 27th that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference – Eden and Molotov – had consulted with each other after receiving his letter regarding the situation in South Vietnam, and also consulted with the representatives of the United States and France. Nehru said: "It is understood that these four countries have been urging the South Vietnamese government to take all necessary actions so that the International Commission can carry out its work properly and take steps to organize elections in accordance with the Geneva Accords."

    南越外交部公报说
    英法美谅解南越对日内瓦协定的态度
    新华社河内十日电　西贡消息：南越外交部在八日晚间发表公报，否认报纸的消息，即英国、法国和美国曾经对南越政府施加压力，要它遵守日内瓦协定的条款。
    南越外交部的公报说，西方三国对于南越对日内瓦协定的态度有清楚的谅解。它暗示对于南越没有按照日内瓦协定从七月二十日开始同越南民主共和国进行协商一事，英、法、美三国是表示同情的。
    大家知道，南越当局对于日内瓦协定的履行负有不可逃避的责任。前已报道，印度总理尼赫鲁七月二十七日曾在印度人民院说，日内瓦会议的两位主席——艾登和莫洛托夫在接到了他的关于南越情势的信件之后就彼此进行了磋商，还同美国和法国的代表进行了磋商。尼赫鲁说：“据悉，这四个国家都竭力敦促南越政府采取一切必要的行动，以便国际委员会能适当地进行工作，并且采取步骤，根据日内瓦协定组织选举。”
