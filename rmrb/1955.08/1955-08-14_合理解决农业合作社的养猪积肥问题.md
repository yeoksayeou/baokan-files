Reasonably Solve the Pig Raising and Manure Accumulation Problems of Agricultural Cooperatives
Liang Shuangbi, Secretary of the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province

Raising pigs and accumulating manure is an important way to increase fertilizer for farmland. Currently, in the Shijiazhuang Special District, many agricultural production cooperative members are raising very few pigs, and the amount of accumulated manure has significantly decreased. According to reports from various places, the existing number of pigs is about one-half less than last year. For example, in six villages, including Houjia Zhuang in Zhengding, Majia Tun in Shenxian, and Wujia Zhuang in Hengshui, there were a total of 928 pigs in 1954, which decreased to 372 in 1955, a decrease of more than 59 percent. The members of the agricultural production cooperatives in villages such as Houjia Zhuang in Zhengding have 253 pigsties, of which 103 are empty.

One of the main reasons for this phenomenon is that agricultural production cooperatives have not earnestly implemented a mutually beneficial policy regarding pig raising and manure accumulation by members. Members accumulate manure from raising pigs, but the cooperative uses it for free without compensation. Members feel that raising pigs and producing fertilizer is not profitable, and they would rather have empty pigsties. Some members reflect that "raising pigs is filling a black hole for the cooperative" and that "raising pigs loses money." According to investigations, raising sows and accumulating manure will lose money if there is no compensation for the manure. If there is compensation for the manure, it can earn more than ten yuan per year. Raising fattening pigs and "large skins" (pigs that have not yet gained fat), the profit is also very small if there is no compensation for the manure.

During the rectification of agricultural production cooperatives, some cooperatives in Shijiazhuang Special District improved and adjusted the methods of pig raising and manure accumulation, and the situation has slightly improved. Facts have proven that wherever the methods have been improved, the pig raising situation has changed. Some have replaced small pigs with large pigs, and some have started buying pigs to raise. For example, in 226 cooperatives in Xingtang, before the rectification, 208 cooperatives accumulated fertilizer in the pigsties of individual members, which was used collectively without compensation, and there were 850 empty pigsties. After the rectification, 73 cooperatives changed to private accumulation for collective use with compensation. Another 119 cooperatives stipulated methods for rewarding pig raising and manure accumulation. In this way, the enthusiasm of members for pig raising and manure accumulation has been improved. According to incomplete statistics, the number of pigs has increased by more than 380, and more than 310 households have ordered pig purchase plans. After Dongwangchun United Cooperative changed its methods, it added five new pigsties and repaired old pigsties and toilets for 23 households within a month. Many members actively bought pigs or replaced small pigs with large pigs. In Xinle Mucun Pingming Cooperative, with 72 member households and 70 pigsties, 25 were empty, and no member carried a basket to pick up manure. After changing the method of collective accumulation and collective use to private accumulation and collective use with compensation last winter, the number of pigs increased by 13 by May of this year, and members picked up more than 18,000 catties of manure individually. This cooperative used seven carts of fertilizer per mu of corn last year. After changing the method, it used nine and a half carts of fertilizer per mu of corn this year.

In order to encourage members to raise pigs, accumulate manure, and open up various sources of fertilizer, agricultural production cooperatives must earnestly implement mutually beneficial policies in dealing with manure and fertilizer. At present, there are several methods of manure accumulation compensation adopted by agricultural production cooperatives in Shijiazhuang Special District. Some cooperatives, based on the needs and possible conditions of production within the cooperative, assign a certain amount of manure accumulation tasks to each member and give reasonable compensation or appropriate rewards according to the size of the pig being raised. For example, Dongwangchun United Cooperative in Xingtang stipulates: a reward of 5 jiao for raising a small pig to 50 catties; 1 yuan for 50 catties to 100 catties; 2.5 yuan for 100 catties to 150 catties; and 3.5 yuan for 150 catties to more than 200 catties, which increases pig raising and manure accumulation. Other cooperatives adopt the method of private accumulation for collective use, pricing according to quality. The method of accumulating manure in some cooperatives is that the cooperative uniformly provides firewood, grass, and sand, and members pad the sties and sprinkle water, so only labor compensation is given. In some cooperatives, firewood and grass are provided by the members, and the cooperative provides sand (a certain amount of sand equals a certain amount of manure from the members), and the cooperative pays for the manure from the members.

Although these methods are not necessarily perfect, they all have a certain effect on encouraging members to raise pigs and accumulate manure. Earnestly implementing mutually beneficial policies in pig raising and manure accumulation is a reliable way to ensure that agricultural production cooperatives increase pig raising and accumulate fertilizer.

### 合理解决农业合作社的养猪积肥问题

    合理解决农业合作社的养猪积肥问题
    中共河北省石家庄地委书记   梁双璧
    养猪积肥是增加农田肥料的重要办法之一。石家庄专区目前很多农业生产合作社社员养猪很少，积肥数量显著下降，据各地反映，现有猪数比去年约减少二分之一上下。例如正定侯家庄、深县马家屯、衡水吴家庄等六村，一九五四年共有猪九百二十八口，一九五五年减少到三百七十二口，减少百分之五十九强。正定侯家庄等村农业生产合作社的社员共有猪圈二百五十三个，其中有一百零三个是空圈。
    造成这种现象的主要原因之一，是农业生产合作社对社员养猪积肥没有认真贯彻互利政策。社员养猪积下圈肥，社内白使不给代价，社员觉得养猪造肥无利可得，宁愿空圈。有些社员反映“养猪是给社填黑窟窿”，“养猪赔钱”。据调查，养母猪积下的圈肥如果不给代价就要赔钱，如果圈肥给代价，一年约可赚十元以上；养肥猪、养“大皮子”（未上膘的猪），圈肥不给代价获利也很少。
    在整顿农业生产合作社时，石家庄专区有部分社把养猪积肥办法作了改进和调整，情况稍有好转。事实证明，凡是改进了办法的社，养猪的情况都有改变，有的把小猪换大猪，有的开始买猪喂养。如行唐的二百二十六个社，整顿前有二百零八个社积肥是社员个人的猪圈，伙积伙用，不给报酬，空圈有八百五十个。整顿后有七十三个社改为私积伙用给报酬；另有一百一十九个社规定了奖励养猪积肥的办法，这样社员养猪积肥热情提高，据不完全统计，猪只增加了三百八十多口，还有三百一十户订了买猪计划。东??春联社改变办法后一个月，即增新猪圈五个，修旧圈和厕所的二十三户，有不少社员积极买猪或把小猪换成大猪。新乐木村平明社七十二户社员，七十个猪圈，有二十五个是空圈，社员没有一个背筐拾粪；去年冬天把伙积伙用的办法改为私积伙用给报酬的办法后，到今年五月增加了十三口猪，社员个人拾粪一万八千多斤。这个社去年每亩玉米施肥七车，改变办法后今年每亩玉米施肥九车半。
    为了鼓励社员养猪积肥，多方开辟肥源，农业生产合作社必须在处理粪肥方面认真贯彻互利政策。目前石家庄专区农业生产合作社采用的积肥报酬办法有好几种：有些社根据社内生产需要和可能条件，由社分配给各社员一定数量的积肥任务，给以合理代价或按喂猪大小给予适当奖励。如行唐东??春联社规定：把小猪喂成五十斤的猪奖五角；五十斤到百斤奖一元；百斤到百五十斤奖二元五角；百五十斤到二百斤以上奖三元五角，养猪增多，圈肥增加。另有些社采取私积伙用，以质论价办法。有的社积圈肥的办法是由社统一出柴草、沙土，社员垫圈、泼水，这样只给劳力报酬。有的社柴草归社员出，社供社员沙土（一定沙土顶社员的一定圈肥），社出代价买社员的圈肥。
    以上这些办法，虽不一定完善，但对鼓励社员养猪积肥的积极性都有一定作用。在养猪积肥方面认真贯彻互利政策，是保证农业生产合作社养猪增积肥料的可靠的办法。
