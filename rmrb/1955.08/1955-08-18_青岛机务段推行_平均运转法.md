    Qingdao Locomotive Depot Promotes "Average Operation Method"
    The Qingdao Locomotive Depot, affiliated with the Jinan Railway Administration, saved 36 tons of locomotive coal in July by promoting the "Average Operation Method." In the first six days of August, it saved more than 25 tons of coal.
    The "Average Operation Method" is actually a synthesis of the advanced experiences of railway labor models Zheng Xikun and Li Shaoqiang. Its main feature is: to make the train use an average amount of steam in each section, so as to generate the maximum amount of heat with less fuel, and to exert the maximum traction of the locomotive with a small amount of steam. This can not only enable the locomotive to pull more and run faster, and improve the working efficiency of the locomotive, but also enable the crew to improve their operation and firing techniques, reduce abnormal wear of parts, and save oil and material costs.

    青岛机务段推行“平均运转法”
    济南铁路管理局所属青岛机务段七月份推行“平均运转法”，节约了三十六吨机车用煤。八月份头六天又节约了二十五吨多用煤。
    “平均运转法”实际上就是铁路劳动模范郑锡坤和李绍强的先进经验的综合。它的主要特点是：使列车在每一区间内平均使用蒸汽的工作量，做到以较少燃料发生最大的热量，以少量的蒸汽发挥机车最大的牵引力。这不仅能使机车多拉快跑，提高机车的工作效率，还可以使乘务员提高操作和烧火的技术，减少机件的不正常磨耗，节约油脂和材料费用。（新华社）
