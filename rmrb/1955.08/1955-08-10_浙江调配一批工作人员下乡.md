To strengthen the leadership of the nearly 40,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to transfer 12,300 full-time cadres to manage the cooperatives. The first batch of more than 4,800 people, drawn from provincial and municipal organs, and six special districts including Jiaxing, Jinhua, and Zhoushan, as well as two directly subordinate counties in the province, have undergone training. By the end of July, more than 3,800 of them had arrived in 24 key counties, including Yongjia, Yin County, Jinhua, Wuxing, and Hang County, to begin work. The second batch of personnel to be transferred to the countryside will all be assembled in August. After training, this group of personnel will be assigned to various counties throughout the province. This work is expected to be basically completed by mid-September.

This transfer of cadres is being carried out in accordance with the principles of streamlining the upper levels to strengthen the lower levels and cultivating full-time professional cadres. More than 3,000 of them have been selected from organs at the provincial, municipal, special district, and county levels, and 9,000 have been selected from district and township cadres and technical extension stations. When they are assigned to the countryside, they generally become mutual aid and cooperation counselors, working under the leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation departments of the county Party committees.

    浙江调配一批工作人员下乡
    中共浙江省委员会为加强全省现有近四万个农业生产合作社的领导，决定调配一万二千三百名专职办社干部。第一批从省、市级机关和嘉兴、金华、舟山等六个专区以及该省两个直属县抽调的四千八百多人，经过学习，到七月底，已有三千八百多人先后到达永嘉、鄞县、金华、吴兴、杭县等二十四个重点县开始工作。第二批调配下乡人员在八月份可以全部集中，这批人员经过训练后，将分配给全省各县，这项工作预计在九月中旬可以基本完成。
    这次调配干部是根据精简上层充实下层和培养专职专业干部这个原则进行的，其中有三千多名决定从省、市、专区和县各级机关抽调，有九千名从区乡干部和技术推广站等部门选拔。他们分配到农村去，一般的都成为互助合作辅导员，在各县中共县委互助合作部的领导下进行工作。
