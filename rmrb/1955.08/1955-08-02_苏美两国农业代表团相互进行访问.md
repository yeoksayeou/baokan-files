Xinhua News Agency, 31st Dispatch: According to TASS, the Soviet agricultural delegation has been visiting various places in Iowa, USA, for several days.

Wherever the delegation went, it was warmly welcomed and received by local farmers and people from all walks of life. For example, on the 21st, while on their way to visit Amana, the delegation made a brief stop at the farm of Logan Uraice. The farm owner pointed to the words "Welcome, Comrades!" written in Russian on the farm building and told the delegation that his son had stayed up all night to write them. American farmers showed great interest in the Soviet Union, asking questions ranging from the weather in the Soviet Union to the income of collective farmers. American farmers asked members of the delegation for autographs, took photos with them, and invited them to visit their farms. On the 23rd and 24th, most members of the Soviet delegation spent Saturday afternoon and most of Sunday in the homes of American farmers.

The number of invitations from all over the United States for the delegation to visit is increasing. A representative from the University of Iowa told the Soviet delegation that if they were to visit everyone who wanted to invite the Soviet delegation, even twenty-five years would not be enough.

Many American farmers expressed their desire to visit the Soviet Union to the delegation. On the evening of the 27th, the head of the delegation, Matskevich, held a reception in Des Moines. The film "Soviet Agricultural Exhibition of 1954" shown at the reception aroused great interest.

The activities of the Soviet agricultural delegation have been the focus of local newspapers. More than 60 reporters and photographers from American newspapers and news agencies are following the delegation, and all local newspapers are reporting on the delegation's activities in detail in important positions.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch: According to TASS, the American agricultural delegation, which is currently visiting the Soviet Union, has arrived in the Kuban region to continue its visit after visiting places in Ukraine.

The delegation arrived in Moscow on July 15. They stayed in Moscow for three days, visiting the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition, Moscow University, and the Lochi Collective Farm and Gorky-II State Farm in the Moscow region.

On July 18, the delegation left Moscow and continued its visit to Ukraine, the granary of the Soviet Union. They visited some agricultural research institutions and production units in Kharkov, Dnepropetrovsk Oblast, Zaporozhye Oblast, Odessa and other places, and learned about the local agricultural research work and the living conditions of agricultural workers. The delegation was warmly welcomed everywhere. Collective farm members enthusiastically presented the American guests with bread and salt placed on towels embroidered with national patterns, according to Ukrainian traditions.

After visiting Kharkov, the head of the delegation, Lambert, said: People in all walks of life here "have sincere, courteous, and genuine feelings of kindness, which impressed us deeply. I believe that only through this direct contact between the people of the Soviet Union and the people of the United States can we achieve a better mutual understanding between our two peoples."

    苏美两国农业代表团相互进行访问
    新华社三十一日讯　据塔斯社消息：苏联农业代表团连日来在美国衣阿华州各地进行参观访问。
    代表团不论到那里，都受到当地农民和其他各界人士热烈的欢迎和接待。例如，代表团二十一日在去阿密斯城访问的途中，曾经在洛根·乌里斯的农场里稍作逗留，农场主人指着农场建筑物上用俄文写的“欢迎，同志们！”几个大字告诉代表团说，这是他的儿子忙了一整个晚上写起来的。美国农民们对苏联表现了浓厚的兴趣，询问的问题从苏联的天气一直到集体农民的收入。美国农民要代表团团员签名留念，同他们一起照相，邀请他们去参观自己的农场。二十三日和二十四日，苏联代表团的大多数团员都在美国农民的家中渡过了星期六下午和星期日的大部分时间。
    来自美国各地的邀请代表团去访问的请柬愈来愈多。衣阿华大学的一位代表告诉苏联代表团说，如果要去访问所有想邀请苏联代表团的人的话，甚至二十五年的时间都不够。
    许多美国农民向代表团表示了想到苏联去访问的愿望。二十七日晚，代表团团长马茨凯维奇在得梅因举行了招待会。在招待会上放映的影片“一九五四年苏联农业展览会”引起了极大的兴趣。
    苏联农业代表团的活动一直是地方报纸注意的中心。跟随代表团进行采访的有美国六十多家报纸和通讯社的记者和摄影记者，所有地方报纸都用重要的地位详细报道代表团的活动。
    新华社一日讯　据塔斯社消息：目前正在苏联访问的美国农业代表团，在乌克兰等地参观后已到库班地区继续访问。
    代表团是七月十五日到达莫斯科的。他们在莫斯科逗留了三天，参观了苏联农业展览会、莫斯科大学和莫斯科州的洛赤集体农庄和高尔基—二国营农场。
    七月十八日，代表团离莫斯科到苏联的谷仓乌克兰继续进行访问。他们在哈尔科夫、第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克州、萨坡罗什州、敖德萨等地访问了一些农业研究机关和生产机构，了解了当地农业研究工作和农业劳动者的生活情况。代表团到处都受到了热烈的欢迎。集体农庄庄员热情地按照乌克兰的传统习惯把放在绣着民族花饰手巾上的面包和盐送给美国客人。
    代表团团长兰伯特在哈尔科夫参观完毕后曾说：这里各行业的人们“都有着恳切、殷勤和真诚的善良感情，这给我们的印象很深。我相信，只有通过苏联人民和美国人民的这种直接接触我们才能在我们两国人民之间达到更好的相互谅解。”
