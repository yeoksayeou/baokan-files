　　West European Countries Cannot Support the Burden of Arms Expansion
　　Tan Wenrui
    The call for arms reduction has recently become very loud in Western European countries. The broad masses of the people are more determined than ever to demand an immediate end to the arms race; many bourgeois political leaders and newspapers have also expressed hope for a solution to the disarmament problem. This situation is due, on the one hand, to the growing recognition of the danger of a new war caused by the unrestricted arms race, and also to the fact that the heavy burden of arms expansion is becoming increasingly unbearable for Western European countries.
    Many Western European countries, due to their participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, have undertaken unenviable military obligations and for many years have had to subject their national economies to the purpose of arms expansion and war preparation. These countries continue to increase their military expenditures, consuming large amounts of funds on maintaining large armies and manufacturing weapons. The military expenditures of the eleven Western European countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have increased from 4.8 billion US dollars in 1949 to 10.6 billion US dollars in 1954, and the figure for 1955 is similar. Among them, Britain's military spending has increased 2.2 times during this period, France's has increased 3 times, Italy's has increased 1.6 times, Denmark's has increased 4 times, Norway's has increased nearly 5 times, and Luxembourg's has increased more than 5 times. In a country like Greece, military expenditures in the 1954 fiscal year accounted for as much as 56.3 percent of the total budget expenditure.
    Unrestricted arms expansion naturally has a negative impact on the national economy. The share of military production in the industrial production of Western European countries is increasing. For example, military production in Britain accounts for 17 percent of total industrial output; in France, it accounts for about 15 percent. The expansion of military production is achieved by reducing the production of consumer goods, so the production of civilian industries in these countries has generally been in a state of decline for many years. Some of these countries have seen a slight increase in the overall index of industrial production in recent years, but this is only due to the increased production of industries relying on military orders, and the rate of growth is gradually declining. For example, Britain's total industrial output last year increased by about 6 percent compared to 1953, but several major civilian industries such as coal mining and textiles have been in a slump. The situation in France is similar; although industrial production increased by 8.5 percent, industrial sectors producing consumer goods have remained sluggish. In Italy, many civilian industrial production sectors have not even reached their pre-war levels.
    The negative consequences of the militarization of the national economy are also reflected in the foreign trade of Western European countries. In trade between these countries, the supply of armaments and military materials accounts for a large proportion, but the increase in arms trade cannot help Western European countries escape from stagnation in foreign trade, nor can it stop the trend of declining commodity turnover. The trade crisis in these countries is increasing. Some countries, such as Britain, which rely heavily on foreign trade, need to increase the import of a large amount of raw materials to expand military production. At the same time, because many domestic industrial sectors that originally produced export orders have switched to producing military orders, export capacity is limited, making it impossible to maintain a stable balance of payments in foreign trade. Britain's trade deficit has been developing again since the second half of 1954, reaching more than 120 million pounds in June of this year.
    It is equally clear that the financial crisis caused by arms expansion is becoming increasingly serious in Western European countries. In order to maintain huge military expenditures, Western European countries are constantly increasing the tax burden on the people. The total amount of taxes collected by Denmark in the 1947-1948 fiscal year before joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was more than 3.4 billion kroner, while the total amount of taxes in the 1954-1955 fiscal year reached more than 6 billion kroner. The situation in Britain and France is even more serious. According to British newspaper statistics, British taxes swallow up one-third of the national income, and even British Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler admits that Britain has become "one of the countries with the heaviest taxes in the world." French taxes even account for 43 percent of total national income.
    Despite the fact that taxes have increased to an alarming level, Western European countries still cannot change the long-standing situation of fiscal deficits. Britain's budget deficit in 1954 reached 397 million pounds, 100 million pounds more than in 1953. In Italy's 1955 budget, there is still a huge deficit of 325 billion lire. At the same time, the national debts of these countries are also constantly increasing. Britain's national debt has increased by more than one billion pounds in the five years since joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, reaching a peak of more than 27 billion pounds last September. France's national debt increased to 4.4 trillion francs in October 1954.
    In this situation, inflation has become a common ailment in Western European countries. The situation is serious in countries such as France, where the amount of money is constantly increasing like a snowball. By the end of 1954, the amount of money in circulation had increased from more than 2.1 trillion francs in 1948 to more than 5 trillion francs. The situation in Italy is similar. Last year alone, the amount of currency issued increased by 114 billion lire, reaching an astronomical figure of 1.63 trillion lire. As a result, prices are constantly rising. In Britain, prices in 1954 had risen to the highest level in many years. Prices in Greece rose by 37 percent from April 1953 to the end of 1954. The prices of several major daily necessities in Turkey rose by 25 percent last year.
    From the above situation, it can be seen to what extent the Western European countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have disrupted national finances and economies due to their participation in the arms race. Even some government figures in these countries now cannot but admit that this situation cannot be sustained for long. French Prime Minister Faure has said that it will become increasingly difficult to achieve a balanced budget and avoid inflation without cutting military spending.
    Due to increased taxes, inflation, and rising prices, the real wages and income of the people are decreasing year by year; in addition, the decline of civilian industries and the increase in unemployment and underemployment have resulted in the increasing relative and absolute poverty of the people. Thus, on the one hand, the purchasing power of the people is shrinking, making it more difficult to sell goods, and thus the crisis of overproduction is becoming increasingly ripe; on the other hand, it cannot but intensify the sharpening of domestic class contradictions. The working people of these countries, unwilling to endure harsh living conditions, are more and more determined to rise up to defend their right to live. In Britain, according to official statistics, there were as many as 1,994 strikes in 1954, resulting in a loss of 2.5 million working days. In France and Italy, the strike movement of working people to fight for economic benefits is rising. In 1954, the number of people participating in strikes in Italy was more than 5 million. The working people of these countries unanimously demand that the burden of arms expansion imposed on them be reduced, the economy be stabilized, and the huge military expenditures be used to improve the lives of the broad masses of the people and for socially beneficial purposes. This demand is becoming increasingly strong, forming an irresistible wave.
    Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov pointed out at the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting in February this year: "Now is the time to recognize that a country's economy cannot be maintained on the unhealthy basis of war orders for a long time." This correct assertion is particularly insightful for the Western European countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This is why the Soviet proposal on substantial reductions in armaments and armed forces has been particularly warmly supported and welcomed in Western European countries. It is estimated that if the Soviet disarmament proposal is implemented, the amount of reduction in the French military budget would be enough to produce 4 million tons of coal, 69,000 15-horsepower tractors, 600 million bottles of milk, 750,000 bicycles, and to build 60,000 three-room houses, 1,600 schools, and 18,000 kilometers of roads each year. The increase in such civilian production and welfare undertakings would undoubtedly help to improve the living standards of the people. At the same time, the reduction of military expenditures will greatly reduce the tax burden on the people, thereby increasing the purchasing power of the people and providing favorable stimulation to production. This is greatly beneficial to the entire national economy of Western European countries.
    After the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference, the international situation has generally eased. In the spirit of the Geneva Conference, the Soviet Union recently decided to first reduce the total number of Soviet armed forces by 640,000 before December 15 this year. This is a great encouragement to the movement of the people of Western European countries to strive to reduce the burden of armaments. They demand that Western countries' governments follow the example of the Soviet Union and take prompt practical action to reduce armaments.

　　西欧国家支持不了扩军的重担
　　谭文瑞
    要求裁减军备的呼声最近在西欧各国十分高涨。广大人民群众比过去任何时候更加坚决主张立即结束军备竞赛；不少资产阶级政治领袖和报刊，也表示希望解决裁军问题。这种情况一方面固然是因为人们愈来愈认识到无限制军备竞赛所造成的新战争危险，同时也是由于扩张军备的沉重负担使西欧各国愈来愈受不了。
    西欧许多国家由于参加了北大西洋集团，承担了无可羡慕的军事义务，多年以来不得不使本国的国民经济服从于扩军备战的目的。这些国家继续不断地增加军事开支，把大量资金消耗在维持庞大的军队和制造武器上面。北大西洋集团的十一个西欧国家的军事费用，已从一九四九年的四十八亿美元增加到了一九五四年的一百零六亿美元，一九五五年的数目也不相上下。其中英国在这个期间的军费就增加到二点二倍，法国增加到三倍，意大利增加到一点六倍，丹麦增加到四倍，挪威增加到将近五倍，卢森堡增加到五倍以上。像希腊这样一个国家，一九五四年度的军事费用竟占到全部预算开支的百分之五十六点三之多。
    无限制的军备扩张，自然对国民经济产生了恶劣的影响。西欧各国工业生产中的军事生产份额愈来愈增大。例如英国的军事生产占了全部工业产量的百分之十七；法国也占到百分之十五左右。军事生产的扩大是依靠着缩减消费品的生产来取得的，因此许多年以来这些国家民用工业的生产普遍处于低落的状态。其中一些国家近年工业生产总指数有少许增长，只是由那些依靠军事订货的工业的增产所致，并且增长的速度也在逐步下降。例如英国去年的工业总产量比一九五三年大约增加了百分之六左右，但是像采煤、纺织等几项主要的民用工业却是一蹶不振。法国的情况也是如此，工业生产虽然增长了百分之八点五，然而生产消费品的工业部门仍然毫无起色。意大利有许多民用工业生产部门甚至连战前的水平都还没有达到。
    国民经济军事化的恶果也反映在西欧各国对外贸易上。在这些国家间的贸易中，军备和军事物资的供应占了很大的比重，但是军火贸易的增长并不能使西欧各国的对外贸易脱离停滞状态，不能制止商品流通额缩减的趋势。这些国家的贸易危机有增无已。像英国这样一些主要依靠对外贸易的国家，扩大军事生产，需要增加大量原料的入口，同时又因为国内许多本来生产出口订货的工业部门改而生产军事订货，使出口能力受到限制，就始终不能稳定地保持对外贸易的收支平衡。英国自从一九五四年下半年以来贸易逆差又有发展，到今年六月份逆差已达一亿二千多万英镑。
    同样明显的是，西欧国家因为扩张军备而造成的财政危机愈来愈严重。为了维持巨额军事开支，西欧各国不断增加人民的捐税负担。丹麦在参加北大西洋集团以前一九四七—一九四八财政年度所征收的赋税总额为三十四亿多克朗，而一九五四—一九五五年度的赋税总额达到了六十亿多克朗。英、法等国的情形更为严重。据英国报纸统计，英国的赋税吞没了三分之一的国民收入，连英国财政大臣巴特勒也承认，英国已成为“世界上捐税最重的国家之一”。而法国的赋税甚至占到全部国民收入的百分之四十三。
    尽管捐税增加到了可惊的水平，但是西欧各国依然不能改变长期存在的财政收支入不敷出的状况。英国一九五四年度的预算赤字达到三亿九千七百万英镑，比一九五三年度多一亿英镑。在意大利一九五五年度的预算中，仍然存在着三千二百五十亿里拉的巨额赤字。同时，这些国家的国债也不断增加。英国参加北大西洋集团五年多，国债增加了十几亿英镑，到去年九月，达到二百七十亿多英镑的高峰。法国的国债在一九五四年十月增加到四万四千亿法郎。
    在这种情况下，通货膨胀已成为西欧各国的通病。情况严重的如法国，货币数量像滚雪球一般不断增大，到一九五四年底，货币流通数量已从一九四八年的二万一千多亿法郎增加到五万多亿法郎。意大利的情况也差不多，去年一年内发行货币的数额就增加了一千一百四十亿里拉，达到一万六千三百亿里拉的天文数字。结果是物价不断上涨。英国一九五四年物价已上涨到多年来最高水平。希腊的物价从一九五三年四月到一九五四年底就涨了百分之三十七。土耳其几种主要日用必需品的价格去年上涨了百分之二十五。
    从上面的情况可以看出，北大西洋集团的西欧国家因为参加军备竞赛而把国家财政和经济弄到了何等混乱的程度。连这些国家的某些当政人物现在也不能不承认，这种情形是不能长久维持下去的。法国总理富尔就说过：如果不削减军事开支，要达到平衡预算和避免通货膨胀将愈来愈困难。
    由于捐税加重，通货膨胀，物价上涨，人民的实际工资和收入一年比一年下降；加以民用工业萎缩，失业半失业者增多，结果是人民的相对和绝对贫困日益加深。这样，一方面是人民购买力愈来愈缩小，商品的销售愈加困难，因而使生产过剩的危机日益成熟；另一方面则不能不加剧国内阶级矛盾的尖锐化。这些国家的劳动人民因为不甘忍受恶劣的生活条件，愈来愈坚决地起来为保卫自己的生活权利而斗争。在英国，据官方统计，一九五四年内共发生了罢工一千九百九十四起之多，造成了两百五十万个劳动日的损失。在法国和意大利，劳动人民为争取经济利益而举行的罢工运动更是日益高涨。一九五四年意大利参加罢工的人数在五百万以上。这些国家的劳动人民一致要求减轻加在他们头上的扩军重担，稳定经济，把庞大的军事开支转而用来改善广大人民的生活和有益于社会的用途。这种要求日益强烈，正形成一股不可抗拒的浪潮。
    苏联外交部长莫洛托夫今年二月在苏联最高苏维埃会议上指出：“现在是承认一个国家的经济不能长期在战争定货这种不健康的基础上维持下去的时候了。”这一正确的论断对于北大西洋集团的西欧国家来说，尤其是一针见血。这就是为什么苏联关于大量裁减军备和武装部队的建议在西欧各国特别受到热烈拥护和欢迎的原故。据估计，如果实行苏联的裁军建议，法国军事预算削减的数额，足够每年生产四百万吨煤，六万九千部十五匹马力的拖拉机、六亿瓶牛奶、七十五万辆自行车以及修建六万所一套三间的住宅、一千六百所学校和一万八千公里公路。这样一些民用生产和福利事业的增加，无疑可以有助于提高人民的生活水平。同时军费的削减，将大大减轻人民的捐税负担，从而提高人民的购买力，使生产获得有利的刺激。这对于西欧国家的整个国民经济是大有好处的。
    在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议后，国际形势有了普遍的缓和，苏联本着日内瓦会议的精神，最近决定首先在今年十二月十五日以前在苏联武装部队总人数中裁减六十四万人。这对于西欧各国人民争取减轻军备负担的运动是一个极大的鼓舞。他们要求西方国家政府仿效苏联的榜样，迅速采取实际的行动来减少军备。
