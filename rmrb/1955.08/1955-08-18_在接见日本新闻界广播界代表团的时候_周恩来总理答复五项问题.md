Xinhua News Agency, August 17th – Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, met with the Japanese Press and Broadcasting Delegation on August 17th and answered the questions raised by the delegation. The questions and answers are as follows:

    (1) Question: The Sino-US ambassadors are holding talks in Geneva. We believe it will further ease international tensions. What is Premier Zhou's view on this?

    Answer: China hopes that the Sino-US ambassadorial talks in Geneva will achieve positive results. China is working towards this end. We believe that if both sides have a spirit of reconciliation and make corresponding efforts on an equal footing, the Sino-US talks will help improve Sino-US relations and further ease international tensions, especially in the Far East.

    (2) Question: The Soviet government newspaper published a commentary last December saying that the Soviet Union and China believe the Treaty of San Francisco infringes upon the interests of the Japanese people, but the Treaty of San Francisco does not become an obstacle to adjusting relations with Japan. It has attracted the attention of the Japanese people. What is Premier Zhou's opinion on this?

    Answer: The Treaty of San Francisco is a treaty that violates international agreements and harms the interests of the Japanese nation. It was signed by excluding China, rejecting reasonable Soviet proposals, and violating the will of Asian countries such as India and Burma. The Chinese people firmly oppose this treaty. However, the Chinese people's attitude towards the Treaty of San Francisco does not prevent the promotion of the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations up to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the People's Republic of China and Japan.

    (3) Question: Is the "Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty" between Japan and Chiang Kai-shek a fundamental obstacle to the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations?

    Answer: The Chinese people cannot but feel indignant that the Japanese government signed a so-called peace treaty with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which was spurned by the Chinese people, instead of signing a treaty with the government of the People's Republic of China, which was chosen by the Chinese people themselves. There are still people who do not want to truly change this situation and attempt to echo the so-called "two Chinas" approach, which the Chinese people also firmly oppose. Therefore, any sincere effort to normalize Sino-Japanese relations should lead to the abolition of the Japan-Chiang treaty. Despite the existence of the Japan- Chiang treaty, the Chinese government has still taken a series of steps to promote the normalization of relations between China and Japan. Unfortunately, the Japanese government has not yet made corresponding efforts. If the Japanese government has the same sincerity, then a way to normalize Sino-Japanese relations can be found.

    (4) Question: Premier Zhou once said that he expects Prime Minister Hatoyama or his representative to visit China. Can it be foreseen that it will be the beginning of the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations?

    Answer: Direct contact between leaders of various countries is helpful to enhance mutual understanding. However, in the current situation of Sino-Japanese relations, the time may not be ripe for leaders of the Chinese and Japanese governments to visit each other. Therefore, when Mr. Shichiro Matsumoto and Mr. Orihiko Tanaka asked me if I would welcome Prime Minister Hatoyama to visit China, I expressed my welcome on the one hand, and pointed out that it might be more realistic for Prime Minister Hatoyama to send his representative to visit China. If this can be done, it will be beneficial to improving Sino-Japanese relations.

    (5) Question: Premier Zhou proposed at the National People's Congress a few days ago to establish an Asian collective security system including the United States. We believe this is a very important policy for establishing world peace. Therefore, we hope to hear more specific opinions?

    Answer: In my speech at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress on July 30 this year, I said: "In order to realize the collective peace first advocated by the Indian government, the Chinese people hope that the countries in Asia and the Pacific region, including the United States, will sign a collective peace treaty to replace the current confrontational military blocs in this region."

    It should be explained that in order to respond to the proposal of establishing collective peace and expanding the area of peace first put forward by Indian Prime Minister Nehru, I said as early as the 1954 Geneva Conference: "The government of the People's Republic of China believes that Asian countries should conduct consultations with each other and make joint efforts to maintain peace and security in Asia by mutually undertaking corresponding obligations." We also declared that our proposal does not exclude any country outside Asia. Subsequently, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by China, India, and Burma, and the declaration on promoting world peace and cooperation unanimously adopted by the Asian-African Conference, further paved the way for the establishment of collective peace and the expansion of the area of peace. Therefore, our proposal that countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, including the United States, should sign a collective peace treaty is based on this series of developments.

    The collective peace treaty we advocate is fully in line with the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Its purpose is not to create divisions and confrontation between countries, but to seek peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between countries, so as to replace the current confrontational military blocs in this region. We believe that the practicality of this proposal will become more obvious with the development of the situation conducive to world peace.

    在接见日本新闻界广播界代表团的时候
    周恩来总理答复五项问题
    新华社十七日讯　中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来，在八月十七日接见了日本新闻界广播界访华代表团，对代表团所提出的问题作了答复。问题和答复如下：
    （一）问：中美大使正在日内瓦举行会谈，我们觉得它将促使国际紧张局势进一步地趋向和缓，周总理的看法如何？
    答：中国希望在日内瓦举行的中美大使级会谈能够取得积极的结果。中国方面正在为此努力。我们认为，如果双方都具有和解的精神，并且在对等的基础上作出相应的努力，中美会谈将能有助于中美关系的改进和国际紧张局势、首先是远东局势的进一步和缓。
    （二）问：苏联的政府机关报在去年十二月曾经发表评论说，苏联和中国认为旧金山和约是侵犯日本人民利益的，然而，旧金山和约并不成为调整对日关系的障碍。它曾引起日本人民的注意。对此，周总理的意见如何？
    答：旧金山和约是一个违反国际协议和危害日本民族利益的条约。它是在排斥中国、拒绝苏联合理建议和违反印度、缅甸等亚洲国家的意志的情况下签订的。中国人民坚决反对这个条约。但是，中国人民对旧金山条约的态度，并不妨碍促进中日关系正常化直至缔结中华人民共和国和日本之间的和约。
    （三）问：日本和蒋介石之间的“日华和约”是否是中日邦交正常化的根本障碍？
      答：日本政府不同中国人民自己所选择的中华人民共和国政府签订和约，却同中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石集团签订所谓和约，中国人民不能不感到愤慨。现在还有人不想真正改变这种情况，却企图附和所谓“两个中国”的做法，这也是中国人民坚决反对的。因此，任何对于中日关系正常化的真诚努力，都应该导致日蒋和约的废除。尽管存在着日蒋和约，但是为了促进中日关系的正常化，中国政府仍然采取了一系列的步骤。遗憾的是，日本政府至今还没有作出相应的努力。如果日本政府具有同样的诚意，那末，实现中日关系正常化的途径是可以寻找得到的。
    （四）问：周总理曾说期待鸠山首相或他的代理人访问中国，是否可以预想它将成为中日恢复邦交的开端？
    答：各国政府领导人员之间的直接接触是有助于增进彼此的了解的。但是，在目前中日关系的情况下，中日两国政府领导人员互相访问的时机也许还不成熟。因此，在松本七郎先生和田中织之进先生问我是否欢迎鸠山首相来中国访问的时候，我一方面表示欢迎，另一方面指出，鸠山首相派他的代表来中国访问也许是更现实的。如果这件事能够做到的话，那对于改进中日关系将会是有利的。
    （五）问：周总理在前几天的人民代表大会上提议建立一个包括美国在内的亚洲集体安全保障体制，我们认为这是确立世界和平的极重要的方策，因此希望能听到更具体的意见？
    答：本年七月三十日我在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上所作的发言中说：“为了实现印度政府首先提倡的集体和平，中国人民希望亚洲和太平洋地区的国家，包括美国在内，签订一个集体和平公约，以代替目前存在于这个地区的对立性的军事集团。”
    应该说明，为了响应印度尼赫鲁总理首先提出的建立集体和平、扩大和平地区的主张，早在一九五四年的日内瓦会议上，我就曾经说过：“中华人民共和国政府认为，亚洲国家彼此之间应该进行协商，以互相承担相应的义务的方法，共同努力维护亚洲的和平和安全。”我们并曾经声明，我们这一主张不排斥亚洲以外的任何国家。其后，中国同印度和缅甸一起倡议的和平共处的五项原则和亚非会议一致通过的促进世界和平和合作的宣言，又进一步为建立集体和平和扩大和平地区开辟了道路。因此，我们关于亚洲和太平洋地区的国家，包括美国在内，签订一个集体和平公约的主张，就是根据这一系列的形势发展而提出来的。
    我们所主张的这一个集体和平公约是完全符合于联合国宪章的规定的。它的目的不是要在各国间制造分裂和对立，而是要谋求各国之间的和平相处和友好合作，以代替目前存在于这个地区的对立性的军事集团。我们相信，这一主张的现实性，将会随着有利于世界和平的形势的发展而更加明显。
