    Severely Punish Bad Elements Who Sabotage Grain Policy
    To the Editor:
    Since the rectification work of the urban grain rationing system began, the broad masses of people have actively supported the method of verifying grain supply and have realistically and carefully formulated their own grain consumption plans. However, there are also a few bad elements who have adopted various means to sabotage the state's policy of planned grain supply. The following are some recent incidents discovered in Beijing.
    Zhang Cijian, a capitalist from Yihé Bean Sprout Shop at No. 18 Fushou Lane, Xisi District, has a family of ten. In July, he subscribed to a grain consumption plan of 220 jin, but he bought 330 jin before the grain consumption plan was approved. At the end of the month, he repeatedly asked the grain working group to make up for the grain purchase plan. Was Zhang Cijian short of grain? It has now been found that he has hoarded more than 9,000 jin of grain at home! Among them, about 7,000 jin are mung beans and soybeans, which were secretly stored in the past by buying more beans and making fewer bean sprouts; in addition, there are a lot of flour, wheat, naked oats, etc.
    Shi Haishan, a drum vendor from No. 14 Dongjiaochang, Xisi District, has a family of three. In July, he subscribed to a grain purchase plan of 95 jin, and said it was not enough. He went to the government six times to ask for a supplementary plan. His wife even stopped the government's grain workers on the street and cried loudly. But what is the actual situation? In addition to buying 95 jin of grain in July, Shi Haishan also stored more than 300 jin of grain at home.
    Xu Jinsong, a resident of No. 20 Xiaoshatuyuan, Qianmen District, used sixty large and small utensils to store twenty-three kinds of grain such as flour, red kidney beans, large peas, glutinous rice, sorghum, bran, and wheat, totaling more than 1,300 jin; many of them were stored several years ago and have now become moldy. Xu Jinsong had so much grain stored, but she did not report it to the state as required when the grain rationing work began. When the working group learned about her family's grain consumption in July, she also said: "I'm short of grain for a day or two, I'll wait until the end of the month to make it up!"
    Zhang Guihua, a female capitalist who runs a barber shop at No. 102 Xizhimen Street, privately altered her grain purchase certificate in an attempt to buy more grain. When the working group went to check her grain purchase certificate, she also beat the inspectors. Her younger brother said: "If you check me, I will kill a few of them!"
    In order to implement the state's grain policy and protect the interests of the people, we believe that the government should severely punish these lawbreakers; at the same time, we should strengthen the publicity of the planned grain supply and mobilize the broad masses to expose all acts that undermine the planned grain supply.

    严厉惩办破坏粮食政策的坏分子编辑同志：
    自从城市粮食统销的整顿工作开展以来，广大人民群众都积极拥护核实供应粮食的办法，实事求是、精打细算地订出自己的用粮计划。但是，也有少数坏分子采取各种手段来破坏国家计划供应粮食的政策。下面就是北京市最近发现的一些事例。
    西四区福寿里十八号义合豆芽铺资本家张次俭，家中大小十口人，七月份订了二百二十斤的吃粮计划，但是在吃粮计划还没有审批以前就买了三百三十斤；而到月底又三番五次到粮食工作组要求追补购粮计划。张次俭到底是不是缺粮呢？现在已经查明，他家里囤积了粮食九千多斤之多！其中绿豆、黄豆共七千斤左右，都是过去用多买豆子、少做豆芽的办法偷存下来的；另外还有不少面粉、小麦、莜面等。
    西四区东教场十四号打鼓小贩史海山，家中三口人，七月份订了九十五斤购粮计划，还说不够吃，前后六次到政府去要求追补计划。他的老婆甚至在大街上拦住政府的粮食工作人员大哭大喊。但是实际情况是怎样呢？史海山除了七月份购得九十五斤粮食以外，家中还存着三百多斤粮食。
    前门区小沙土园二十号居民徐金松，用大小六十个器具积存着面粉、红芸豆、大豌豆、江米、红粮、麸皮、小麦等二十三种粮食，共一千三百多斤；其中有不少是几年前就存下来的，现在已经霉坏了。徐金松存有这么些粮食，在粮食统销工作开始时，却没有按规定向国家报告；当七月份工作组了解她家吃粮情况时，她还说：“差一两天的粮食，等到月底再去补吧！”
    西直门大街一百零二号理发铺的女资本家张桂华私自涂改购粮证，企图多买粮食。当工作组去检查她的购粮证时，还殴打检查人员。她的弟弟说：“要是检查我，非弄死他们几个不可！”
    为了贯彻国家的粮食政策，保障人民的利益，我们认为政府应该严厉地惩办这些违法分子；同时加强粮食计划供应的宣传工作，发动广大群众都来检举一切破坏粮食计划供应的行为。
