Conserve Cassia Bark, Ensure Exports
He Ke

Cassia bark is mainly used as a spice for food flavoring, and can also be used to make stomachic medicines and cassia oil. Cassia bark is one of China's major export commodities and enjoys a high reputation in the international market. China's annual output of cassia bark accounts for about 75% of the total needed by the world market.

Exporting cassia bark can earn a lot of materials necessary for national industrial construction. For example, exporting one ton of cassia bark can be exchanged for one and a half tons of steel, and exporting 20,000 tons of cassia bark can be exchanged for equipment for a thermal power plant with a power generation capacity of 25,000 kilowatts. The cassia bark exported from 1950 to 1954, five years in total, could be exchanged for equipment for two cotton textile mills with 50,000 spindles.

China's annual output of cassia bark is about 200,000 dan, mainly produced in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. However, due to the prolonged drought last autumn and the frost and snow this year in these two provinces, some cassia trees have withered and died. In addition, some farmers peeled off immature cassia bark in advance, which also affected the growth of cassia trees. Therefore, the output of cassia bark this year is estimated to decrease by about 40% to 50%. Under this circumstance, domestic consumption of cassia bark should be reduced as much as possible to ensure this year's cassia bark exports.

    节约桂皮，保证出口
    何可
    桂皮的主要用途是做食品调味香料，也可制健胃药品和桂油。桂皮是我国大宗出口物资之一，在国际市场上享有很高的声誉。我国每年输出的桂皮约为世界市场需要总量的百分之七十五左右。
    输出桂皮，可为国家换回很多工业建设必须的物资。如出口一吨桂皮可换回一吨半钢材，出口两万吨桂皮可换回一座拥有两万五千瓩发电能力的火力发电厂的设备。一九五○年至一九五四年五年中所出口的桂皮，约可换回两座拥有五万纱锭的棉纺织厂的设备。
    我国桂皮的年产量约二十万担，主要产地是广东、广西两省。但是，这两省由于去年秋季久旱不雨，今年年初又有霜雪侵袭，以致有些桂树树干干枯致死，加以部分农民提前削去尚未成熟的桂皮，也影响了桂树的生长，因此今年桂皮的产量，据初步估计可能减产百分之四十至五十左右。在这种情形下，应尽量减少国内桂皮的消费量，以保证今年的桂皮出口。
