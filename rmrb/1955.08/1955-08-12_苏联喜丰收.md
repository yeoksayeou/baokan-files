    Soviet Union Rejoices in Bumper Harvest
    By Our Correspondent in Moscow, Li He

    An endless golden sea of wheat undulates in the wind, as combines advance through the waves. Soviet agricultural workers, employing a vast and powerful array of machinery, are engaged in intense harvesting from south to north. The harvest of wheat has been completed in the North Caucasus, Ukraine, and the lower Volga River region. Harvesting has expanded to the central regions, the middle Volga River region, western Siberia, the Altai Territory, Kazakhstan, and various parts of the Far East. In the south, the harvesting of corn has begun.

    Ukraine, the North Caucasus, and the Volga River region, the main grain-producing areas of the Soviet Union, have reported bumper harvests, and the overall grain harvest for the Soviet Union this year will be fundamentally good. Many advanced agricultural areas have greatly increased grain production and have completed the state's grain procurement plan ahead of schedule.

    Yavtukh Danylets, an elderly collective farm member from Poltava Oblast, said, "I am ninety years old, and this is the first time I have seen such a bumper harvest as this summer." The grain there grew so densely before harvest that it looked like walls. Many collective farms harvested from 2,800 to 3,400 kilograms of grain per hectare. Not only Poltava Oblast, but also Crimea Oblast, Odessa Oblast, Kherson Oblast, Nikolaev Oblast, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Krivoy Rog Oblast, Zaporozhye Oblast, Kharkov Oblast, and other oblasts of the Ukrainian Republic have enjoyed bumper harvests. Many collective farms and state farms have harvested 2,500 to 3,000 kilograms of grain per hectare on large tracts of land, with some areas harvesting 3,500 to 4,000 kilograms per hectare. Sharovich, a combine harvester operator who has been assisting with the harvest from Belarus to Kherson Oblast, harvests 20 hectares and threshes 50,000 kilograms of grain per day. He said, "I have never harvested such good grain in my life. This is not wheat, it is gold."

    Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and Kherson Oblast were the first in Ukraine to complete the state grain procurement plan. Agricultural workers in the former oblast delivered 39.9 million poods of grain (one pood equals 16.38 kilograms) to the state and will over-fulfill the plan by 19.4 million poods. Agricultural workers in the latter oblast delivered 40.1 million poods of grain to the state and will over-fulfill the plan by 17.9 million poods.

    However, the first in the entire Soviet Union to complete the state grain procurement plan was Krasnodar Krai. The agricultural workers of this famous Kuban region have delivered 81.3 million poods of grain (excluding corn and rice) to the state and continue to over-fulfill the plan. If Ukraine's harvest this year is a bumper harvest after a drought last year, then Kuban's harvest this year is another bumper harvest after a bumper harvest last year. The "Kuban" State Farm averaged 2,250 kilograms of grain per hectare on a vast area of over 6,000 hectares, of which 2,900 kilograms per hectare were harvested from 770 hectares planted with the new variety of winter wheat, "Bezostaya 4." Kabaniets, a combine harvester operator at the Labinsk Machine and Tractor Station, harvested 449 hectares and threshed 1.06 million kilograms of grain.

    The Don River region has also enjoyed a bumper harvest. Many collective farms and state farms have harvested 2,000 to 2,500 or even 3,000 kilograms of grain per hectare. Agricultural workers in the Kamensk Oblast have completed the state grain procurement plan ahead of schedule, delivering 37 million poods of grain to procurement stations and guaranteeing to over-fulfill the plan by 22 million poods.

    The southeastern part of the European Soviet Union is an arid steppe region, which has also enjoyed a bumper harvest this year. As of early August, the Stalingrad Oblast had harvested 1.24 million hectares, with an average yield of 2,100 to 2,500 kilograms per hectare for rye and 2,600 to 3,000 kilograms per hectare for winter wheat in many districts.

    The spectacle of bumper harvests in many parts of the Soviet Union this year reflects the efforts made by the Soviet state and Soviet agricultural workers not only to cultivate wasteland and plant high-yielding corn, but also to generally increase grain production.

    During this year's harvest, an unprecedentedly strong agricultural machinery force is being used. In the first half of this year, the state supplied the countryside with approximately 80,000 tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower per unit), 58,000 trucks, 21,000 grain combines, and many other agricultural machines and tools. This has brought the number of tractors used in the countryside to over 1.4 million and the number of grain combines to 350,000.

    In order to strive for the fastest possible harvest without loss, various effective measures have been adopted. During the harvest, combine harvester operators and even urban workers from neighboring unharvested areas have rushed to provide support. During the harvest in Ukraine, many volunteers came from Belarus and the Baltic Republics to offer assistance. During the harvest in Kharkov Oblast, tens of thousands of workers from the city of Kharkov went to provide support, and Kharkov factories sent half of their cars. Recently, 6,000 combine harvester operators, along with their machines, came from various republics to assist with the harvest in the newly cultivated areas of Kazakhstan, and another 6,000 will follow. Kuban has adopted a two-stage harvesting method. It is cut when the grain is first ripe, and threshed two or three days later when the grain is fully ripe and dry.

    This year, agricultural workers in various places are striving to complete the harvest in about ten days. The Lenin Collective Farm in the Kurgan District of Kuban and the Mikhailovsky Machine and Tractor Station harvested 6,200 hectares in eleven days, setting a record for the Kuban region. Gorkin, a combine harvester operator at the Nizhne-Khondryuskinsky Machine and Tractor Station in Kamensk Oblast, harvested 472 hectares and threshed 1.1 million kilograms of grain in ten days.

    The good news of the Soviet Union's bumper harvest brings great joy to the Soviet people and to us. Moreover, it is also gratifying that the large amount of corn that has been expanded for planting in the Soviet Union this year is growing very well, and is as tall as a forest in many places. Therefore, a bumper harvest of corn, which is of great significance for the development of animal husbandry, is also expected. (August 11)

    苏联喜丰收
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    一望无垠的黄金麦浪随风起伏，收割机乘着麦浪前进。苏联农业劳动者运用强大众多的机器，从南到北，紧张地进行着收割。高加索北部、乌克兰、伏尔加河下游流域，收割了麦子。收割扩展到了中部地区、伏尔加河中游流域、西伯利亚西部、阿尔泰边疆、哈萨克斯坦和远东各地。南方已着手收割玉蜀黍。
    苏联的主要产粮区乌克兰、北高加索和伏尔加河流域都告丰收，全苏联的谷物收成今年基本上将是很好的。许多先进农产区大大提高了谷物产量，提前完成了国家的采购谷物计划。
    坡尔塔瓦州集体农庄老庄员雅甫图赫·达尼茨说：“我活了九十岁，像今夏这样丰收，是第一次见到。”那里谷物在收割前密密地长得像墙壁。许多集体农庄每公顷收割了从二千八百到三千四百公斤的谷物。不仅坡尔塔瓦州、而且克里木州、敖德萨州、赫尔松州、尼古拉也夫州、第聂伯彼特罗夫斯克州、克里沃罗格州、查坡洛什州、哈尔科夫州以及乌克兰共和国的其他州都丰收。许多集体农庄和国营农场在大片土地上每公顷收割了二千五百到三千公斤谷物，个别地区收割了三千五百到四千公斤谷物。从白俄罗斯到赫尔松州，帮助收割的联合收割机手沙洛维奇每天收割二十公顷，每天打五万公斤谷物。他说：“我一生还没有收割这样好的粮食。这不是麦子，是金子。”
    第聂伯彼特罗夫斯克州和赫尔松州在乌克兰首先完成了国家的采购粮食计划。前一州的农业劳动者交给国家三千九百九十万普特谷物（一普特等于十六点三八公斤），还要超计划多交一千九百四十万普特。后一州的农业劳动者交给国家四千零十万普特谷物，还要超计划多交一千七百九十万普特。
    但是在全苏联第一个完成国家采购粮食计划的，是克拉斯诺达尔边疆。这个有名的库班的农业劳动者交给了国家八千一百三十万普特谷物（不包括玉蜀黍和稻子），还在继续超计划地多交。如果说今年乌克兰是在去年因旱歉收之后的丰收，那末今年库班是在去年丰收之后的又一个丰收。“库班”国营农场在六千多公顷的广大面积上平均每公顷收割了二千二百五十公斤谷物，其中七百七十公顷种新品种“别左斯泰四号”冬小麦的每公顷收割了二千九百公斤。拉宾机器拖拉机站的联合收割机手卡巴涅茨收割了四百四十九公顷，打了一百零六万公斤谷物。
    顿河流域也丰收。许多集体农庄和国营农场每公顷收割了二千到二千五百甚至三千公斤的谷物。卡明州的农业劳动者提前完成了国家采购粮食计划，向采购站交了三千七百万普特谷物，保证还要超计划地多交二千二百万普特。
    苏联欧洲部分的东南方是干旱的草原地带，今年也丰收。斯大林格勒州在八月初已经收割一百二十四万公顷，许多区黑麦平均每公顷打二千一百到二千五百公斤，冬小麦打二千六百到三千公斤。
    苏联今年许多地方丰收的景象，反映了苏联国家和苏联农业劳动者不但为开垦荒地、为种植高产量的玉蜀黍，而且为普遍提高谷物产量所作的努力。
    今年收割时，人们使用着空前雄厚的农业机械力量。今年上半年国家供给了农村约八万台拖拉机（以每台十五匹马力计算）、五万八千辆卡车、二万一千台谷物联合收割机和许多其他的农业机械、农具。这使得现在农村使用的拖拉机超过一百四十万台，谷物联合收割机达到三十五万台。
    为了争取最快的毫无损失地收割，采用了种种有效的办法。在收割时，临近未收割区域的联合收割机手甚至城市劳动者都赶去支援。乌克兰收割时，由白俄罗斯和波罗的海沿岸共和国来了许多志愿支援者。哈尔科夫州收割时，哈尔科夫市几万劳动者去支援，哈尔科夫各工厂把自己的半数汽车派去。最近有六千名联合收割机手和自己的机器一起从各共和国到哈萨克斯坦的新开垦区援助收割，接着还要去六千名。库班采用了分作两段收割的方法。在谷物初熟时割，割后两三天谷物全熟和变干时打。
    今年各地农业劳动者都争取在十天左右收割完毕。库班库尔干区列宁集体农庄和米海洛夫斯基机器拖拉机站在十一天内收割了六千二百公顷，创造了库班区的纪录。卡明州下孔德留斯基机器拖拉机站联合收割机手高尔金在十天内收割了四百七十二公顷，打了一百一十万公斤谷物。
    苏联丰收的喜讯带给苏联人民和我们巨大的欢欣。而且还值得高兴的是，今年在苏联扩大种植的大量玉蜀黍都长得很好，在许多地方高大得同树林一样。因此，对于发展畜牧业具有重大意义的玉蜀黍的丰收，也是可以预期的。　（八月十一日）
