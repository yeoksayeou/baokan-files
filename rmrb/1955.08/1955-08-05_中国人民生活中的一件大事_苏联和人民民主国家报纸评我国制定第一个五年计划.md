A Major Event in the Lives of the Chinese People
--Soviet and People's Democratic Countries' Newspapers Comment on China's Formulation of the First Five-Year Plan

Soviet "Pravda"
"Pravda" published an editorial on the 3rd entitled "The First Five-Year Plan of the People's Republic of China," saying that the Second Session of the First National People's Congress of China passed the first Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the People's Republic of China, which is a major event in the lives of the great Chinese people. The First Five-Year Plan is a five-year plan for peaceful economic construction and cultural construction, the purpose of which is to lay a solid foundation for the country's socialist transformation.

The editorial said that the basic task of China's Five-Year Plan is formulated in accordance with the general line of the Communist Party of China during the transition period. The result of the Five-Year Plan will be a significant increase in the strength of the socialist economy. Its completion will provide a strong material basis for building socialism in China.

The editorial said that in the struggle for industrialization and socialist transformation of the national economy, Chinese workers and peasants rely first on their own strength, and at the same time on the help of the Soviet Union and the entire peace, democracy, and socialist camp. The glorious Communist Party armed the Chinese working people with unwavering confidence in their creativity and their historical mission. It united and organized the masses of the people throughout the country and guided them onto the bright road of socialist construction. The correct leadership of the working class and its vanguard—the Communist Party—and the unbreakable alliance between the working class and the working peasants are a reliable guarantee for the successful completion of the First Five-Year Plan of the People's Republic of China.

The editorial emphasized that the great significance of the Five-Year Plan is that, with its completion, the Chinese people will take a big step forward on the road to transforming their country into a powerful industrial nation. The international significance of the first Five-Year Plan for the development of China's national economy is also very great. The historically significant example of the Chinese people, who have been permanently freed from feudal and imperialist oppression, tells the people of countries that are still in colonial and semi-colonial status what path they should take. The people of the East cannot fail to see that China, which in the past was the object of plunder and trampling, now has the possibility of building its own powerful industry. China's industrialization will promote the further strengthening of China's economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and other countries in the democratic camp. China's industrial development also creates conditions for expanding trade ties with capitalist countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

The editorial concluded by saying that the Soviet people are delighted with the outstanding achievements of their friends and allies—the Chinese people—and warmly hope that they will achieve further labor victories in building a free, great, and strong motherland.

Czechoslovak "Red Right Newspaper"
Czechoslovak "Red Right Newspaper" and "Labor Newspaper" published editorials commenting on the first Five-Year Plan of the People's Republic of China.

"Red Right Newspaper" said that the figures and facts of the first Five-Year Plan of the People's Republic of China show the inevitable path of the Chinese people towards socialism. Only the blind or the enemy who ignores every fresh and beautiful thing happening in great China today cannot see or is unwilling to see the victory of the Chinese people and the growth of this country's strength.

"Red Right Newspaper" said: The working people of Czechoslovakia fully realize what the friendship of the great Chinese people means for strengthening their security and peaceful construction, and they express their heartfelt joy for the victorious road of their friends.

The newspaper concluded: "All the people of our country wholeheartedly congratulate their Chinese friends and wish them further great achievements on our common path towards peace and socialism."
Hungarian "Free People's Newspaper"
"Free People's Newspaper" commented on the first Five-Year Plan of the People's Republic of China, saying: The Hungarian people are watching with great concern the efforts and heroic labor of the fraternal Chinese people in realizing the first Five-Year Plan. The Five-Year Plan is a major event in the lives of the Chinese people, and we are happy and inspired by the achievements and victories of the Chinese people, because we know that the achievements and victories of the Chinese people will greatly strengthen the strength of the peace and socialism camp.

Romanian "Spark Newspaper"
"Spark Newspaper" published an editorial commenting on the first Five-Year Plan of the People's Republic of China. The editorial said: China today is a free and independent country, a great power in the world, and with the great brotherly assistance of the Soviet Union and the support of the entire peace and socialist camp, it is successfully developing its peaceful economy. The People's Republic of China, with its unlimited human resources and strong economic potential, and with its ever-increasing prestige as a great peace-loving country in Asia and the world, makes a significant contribution to peace and socialism.

The editorial said that the report on the first Five-Year Plan made by Li Fuchun, Vice Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China and Director of the State Planning Commission, reflects the great development of the peaceful construction work enthusiastically launched by the great Chinese people under the leadership of their People's Government and their glorious Communist Party.

The editorial wrote, while analyzing the development of China's industrialization based on the figures of the Five-Year Plan: All these achievements have become possible and will become possible because the Chinese people have been freed from feudal rule and imperialist exploitation and have embarked on the bright road of building socialism. China's strong political and economic development has set a brilliant example for all colonial and backward countries to carry out a victorious struggle for the liberation and prosperity of their motherland.

    中国人民生活中的一件大事
    ——苏联和人民民主国家报纸评我国制定第一个五年计划
    苏联“真理报”
    “真理报”三日以“中华人民共和国的第一个五年计划”为题发表社论说，第一届中国全国人民代表大会第二次会议通过了中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，这是伟大的中国人民生活中的一件大事。第一个五年计划是一个和平的经济建设和文化建设的五年计划，这个五年计划的目的是要为国家的社会主义改造事业奠定巩固的基础。
    社论说，中国五年计划的基本任务是根据中国共产党在过渡时期的总路线制定的。五年计划的结果将是社会主义经济力量的重大增长。它的完成将为在中国建成社会主义提供强大的物质基础。
    社论说，中国工人和农民在争取工业化、争取国民经济的社会主义改造的斗争中，首先依靠自己的力量，同时依靠苏联和整个和平、民主和社会主义阵营的帮助。光荣的共产党以对自己的创造力，对自己的历史使命的坚定不移的信心武装了中国劳动人民。它把全国人民群众团结和组织起来，引导他们走上社会主义建设的光明大道。工人阶级及其先锋队——共产党——方面的正确领导，工人阶级和劳动农民的牢不可破的联盟是胜利完成中华人民共和国第一个五年计划的可靠保证。
    社论强调说，五年计划的伟大意义是，由于它的完成，中国人民将在变自己的国家为强大的工业国的道路上前进一大步。发展中国国民经济的第一个五年计划的国际意义也是很大的。永远摆脱封建和帝国主义压迫的中国人民具有历史意义的榜样告诉目前还处在殖民地和半殖民地地位的国家人民，他们应当走什么样的路。东方人民不能不看到，中国在过去是被掠夺和被蹂躏的对象，现在却有可能建立自己强大的工业。中国的工业化将促进中国同苏联和民主阵营其他国家的经济合作的进一步加强。中国的工业发展还为在平等互利基础上扩大同资本主义国家的贸易联系创造条件。
    社论最后说，苏联人民为自己的朋友和同盟者——中国人民的卓越成就感到欢欣鼓舞，并且热烈地希望他们在建设自由、伟大和强盛的祖国中进一步取得劳动上的胜利。
    捷“红色权利报”
    捷克斯洛伐克的“红色权利报”和“劳动报”发表社论评论中华人民共和国的第一个五年计划。
    “红色权利报”说，中华人民共和国的第一个五年计划的数字和事实，显示了中国人民走向社会主义的必然的道路。只有瞎子或者无视今天伟大的中国发生的每一件新鲜美好的事物的敌人，才看不到或者不愿意看到中国人民的胜利和这个国家力量的壮大。
    “红色权利报”说：捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民充分地认识到伟大的中国人民的友谊对于加强他们的安全与和平建设意味着什么，他们对于他们的朋友的胜利的道路表示衷心的欢欣。
    这家报纸最后写道：“我国全体人民衷心地祝贺他们的中国朋友们，在我们共同走向和平和社会主义的道路上获得进一步巨大成就。”匈“自由人民报”
    “自由人民报”就中华人民共和国的第一个五年计划发表评论说：匈牙利人民以极大的关怀注视着兄弟般的中国人民在实现第一个五年计划中的努力和英勇劳动。五年计划是中国人民生活中的一件大事，我们为中国人民的成就和胜利而感到高兴和鼓舞，因为我们知道：中国人民的成就和胜利将大大加强和平和社会主义阵营的力量。
    罗“火花报”
    “火花报”发表社论，评论中华人民共和国的第一个五年计划。社论说：中国今天已是一个自由独立的国家，一个世界上的大国，它在苏联伟大的兄弟般的援助和整个和平和社会主义阵营的支持下，正在成功地发展它的和平经济。中华人民共和国以它无限的人力和雄厚的经济潜能，以它作为一个伟大的爱好和平的国家在亚洲和全世界所享有的日益增长的巨大威望，来对和平和社会主义作出重大的贡献。
    社论说，中华人民共和国国务院副总理、国家计划委员会主任李富春所作的关于第一个五年计划的报告反映出伟大的中国人民在他们的人民政府和他们的光荣的共产党的领导下热烈展开的和平建设工作的巨大发展。
    社论在根据五年计划的数字来分析中国工业化的发展情况时写道：所有这些成就之所以会成为可能和将成为可能，是因为中国人民已经摆脱了封建统治和帝国主义剥削，并且开始走上了建设社会主义的光明大道。中国的强大的政治和经济的发展为所有的殖民地和落后国家树立了为争取祖国的解放和繁荣而进行胜利斗争的光辉榜样。
