    Educate Farmers Not to Sell Tender Corn
    Recently, we have received letters from readers in cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and some cities in Hebei, Liaoning, and Jiangsu, reflecting the phenomenon of some farmers and peddlers selling tender corn in towns and cities during the corn's milk stage. Obviously, picking and selling corn that is not yet mature will inevitably reduce the grain harvest. This is contrary to the national spirit of increasing grain production. Therefore, readers suggest that agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and all farmer brothers in corn-producing areas should not sell tender corn for petty gains; local governments should also persuade and dissuade farmers and peddlers who sell tender corn.

    教育农民不要出卖嫩玉米
    最近，我们收到北京、天津和河北、辽宁、江苏一些城市中的读者来信，反映在玉米壮浆的季节，城镇里就出现一些农民和小贩出售嫩玉米的现象。很显然，把还没有成熟的玉米摘下来卖，必然要减少粮食的收获量。这同国家增产粮食的精神是相违背的。因此，读者建议玉米产区的农业生产合作社、互助组和全体农民兄弟不要贪图小利而出售嫩玉米；各地政府对出售嫩玉米的农民和小贩，也应该进行说服和劝阻。
