Farmers in the suburbs of Shenyang are raising large numbers of chicks. This year, the Shenyang Livestock Farm, electric incubators, and the broad masses of farmers have used electric incubation or kang (heated brick bed) incubation methods to hatch more than 1.15 million chicks, and have hatched and promoted one million excellent white "Leghorn" laying hens. The number of chickens raised in the suburbs alone has increased by about 42 percent compared to the same period in 1954.

Almost every household in the suburbs raises local chickens. According to incomplete statistics, farmers in the suburbs have hatched more than 400,000 chicks themselves. More than 1,000 specialized chicken farming households have also raised a large number of excellent white "Leghorn" chickens this year.

Even before the agricultural production cooperatives started raising chicks, the Shenyang Livestock Farm helped the cooperatives train chicken raising technicians and taught chicken raising techniques. When the cooperatives were raising chicks, the Municipal Livestock Farm sent technicians to provide technical guidance and on-site operational demonstrations, which greatly encouraged the agricultural production cooperatives' enthusiasm for raising chickens. This year, the Wusan Vegetable Production Cooperative and the Renjing and Yaogou agricultural production cooperatives alone raised more than 4,000 white "Leghorn" chickens. Around National Day, these chickens will be able to produce a large number of eggs to supply the city. (Xie Zhaoming)

　　沈阳郊区农民大量饲养鸡雏
    沈阳市畜牧场、电气孵化业，和广大的农民群众，今年利用电气孵化或炕孵等办法孵化了一百一十五万多只鸡雏，并孵育推广了优良的白色“莱克亨”种产卵鸡一百万只，仅郊区饲养的鸡数即比一九五四年同一时期增加了百分之四十二左右。
    郊区的农民，几乎家家户户都饲养了本地鸡，据不完全统计，市郊农民自家孵化的小鸡就有四十多万只。一千多户专业养鸡户，今年也饲养了大批优良白色“莱克亨”种鸡。
    早在各农业生产合作社还没有开始育雏时，沈阳市畜牧场就帮助各社培养了养鸡技术手，并传授了养鸡技术。各社育雏时，市畜牧场又派出技术员进行技术指导和实地操作示范工作，这都大大鼓舞了农业生产合作社养鸡的积极性。仅五三蔬菜生产社和仁境、腰沟等农业生产合作社今年就饲养了四千多只白色“莱克亨”种鸡，在国庆节前后，这批鸡即可生产大量鸡蛋供应城市。　（解兆明）
