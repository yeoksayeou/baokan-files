The city of Weifang, Shandong Province, is a city with a high concentration of handicrafts and a relatively developed handicraft cooperative movement. There are 43 handicraft production cooperatives and more than 70 handicraft mutual aid groups in various industries such as iron, wood, and bamboo weaving. More than 7,000 independent handicraft laborers have been organized.

The Xinsheng Honglu Production Cooperative is one of these many handicraft production cooperatives. It was formed in 1951 by nine ironworkers. Now, under the leadership of the Party, it has developed into a large cooperative with 335 people. The cooperative has also added two power hammers, one iron pressing machine, and ten milling machines, lathes, and planers of various sizes, gradually moving towards semi-mechanized production.

With the development of production, the cooperative has begun to establish a production management system, a product inspection system, and a wage system based on work. It has also strictly enforced labor discipline and operating procedures, creating favorable conditions for further improving technology and product quality.

The support and assistance of the supply and marketing cooperative has also played a significant role in consolidating and developing the production of the Xinsheng Honglu Production Cooperative. The supply and marketing cooperative not only solved the problem of production and sales by purchasing products, but also strengthened its relationship with the iron production cooperative through production and sales meetings. It educated the members to clarify that the purpose of production is to serve the national economic construction and the vast number of urban and rural people, so that the cooperative can achieve the policy of determining production by sales and integrating production and sales.

Currently, the Xinsheng Honglu Production Cooperative is carrying out a campaign to increase production and practice economy centered on improving product quality. It has also widely solicited farmers' opinions and trial-produced more than ten kinds of products according to sales, which has further developed sales channels.

The growth of the Xinsheng Honglu Production Cooperative reflects the superiority of organizing handicraft production and taking the road of cooperativization.

    一个铁业生产合作社的成长
    山东省潍坊市是一个手工业比较集中的城市，也是手工业合作化比较发展的城市。这里有铁业、木业、竹器编织等各行业的手工业生产合作社四十三个、手工业互助组七十多个，组织起来的独立手工业劳动者已有七千多人。
    新胜红炉生产合作社就是这许多手工业生产合作社中的一个，这个生产合作社是在一九五一年由九户铁业劳动者组成的，现在在党的领导下，已发展成有三百三十五人的大社了，社里还添置了二部电锤、一部压铁机和大小铣床、镟床、刨床十部，逐步走上半机械化生产的道路。
    随着生产的发展，社里着手建立生产管理制度、产品检验制度和按劳付酬的工资制度，并严格劳动纪律和操作规程，给进一步改进技术，提高产品质量创造了有利的条件。
    供销合作社的扶持和帮助对巩固和发展新胜红炉生产合作社的生产也起了很大的作用。供销合作社不仅通过收购产品解决了产销问题，而且还通过产销会议加强了同铁业生产合作社的关系，对社员进行了明确生产目的是为了国家经济建设和为城乡广大人民服务的教育，使合作社做到以销定产和产销结合的方针。
    现在，新胜红炉生产合作社正开展以提高产品质量为中心的增产节约运动，并广泛征求农民意见，根据销路试制了十多种产品，使销路有了进一步的发展。
    新胜红炉生产合作社的成长正是体现了手工业生产组织起来走合作化道路的优越性。

    下图：山东省潍坊市新胜红炉生产合作社由于组织起来，使得生产有了进一步的提高，业务也有了更大的发展。这位新入社的复员军人，受到社员们的热烈欢迎。
    合作社同山东省供销合作社潍坊批发站签订了加工和包销合同，使得产品的销路有了更可靠的保证。社员正同供销合作社的干部一起核对第一季度合同完成的情况。
    老社员张焕亭（右）、庄延英正在设计一种小型电锤图样，准备以电动打锤来代替繁重的体力劳动。
    成批的产品包装后，准备送往供销合作社，供给广大农民使用。
    逐步用机械来代替繁重的体力劳动是铁业生产合作社发展的方向。社员们怀着很大的兴趣参观了国营潍坊柴油机厂的机器设备。
