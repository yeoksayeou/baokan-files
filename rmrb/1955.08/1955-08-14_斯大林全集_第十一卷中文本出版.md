Xinhua News Agency, August 13th: The Chinese edition of "The Complete Works of Stalin," Volume 11, has been published. It is scheduled to be released on the 15th in Xinhua bookstores in Beijing and throughout the country.

　　Volume 11 includes Stalin's works from January 1928 to March 1929. During this period, based on the achievements already made in the country's socialist industrialization, the Bolshevik Party resolutely implemented the agricultural collectivization policy adopted by the 15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), preparing all the necessary conditions for comprehensive collectivization, while the class struggle became increasingly complex and acute.

　　In works such as "On the Work of the Joint Plenum of the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission in April," "Summary of the July Plenum of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," "On the Grain Front," "On Industrialization and the Grain Problem," "On the Combination of Workers and Peasants and State Farms," "On Grain Procurement and the Prospects for Agricultural Development," "Lenin and the Problem of Alliance with the Middle Peasants," in his speech at the Eighth Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, and in the essay "Against Vulgarizing the Slogan of Self-Criticism," Stalin determined the main paths and methods for solving the grain problem, building collective farms and state farms, and consolidating the alliance between urban and rural areas. He demonstrated the necessity of rapidly developing industry—the foundation of socialism and national defense—proposed the task of cultivating new cadres from the working class, and elaborated on the significance of criticism and self-criticism, considering it a method for the Bolsheviks to educate cadres and a driving force for the development of Soviet society.

　　In a letter "To All Members of the Central Political Bureau," in speeches such as "On the Rightist Danger in the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," "On State Industrialization and the Rightist Deviation in the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," "The Bukharin Group and the Rightist Deviation in Our Party," in the article "Degenerated to the Utmost," and other works, Stalin exposed the kulak counter-revolutionary essence of the right-wing capitulationists, revealed the sabotage activities of the right-wing capitulationists and the Trotskyist anti-Soviet secret organizations, and pointed out the necessity of conducting an uncompromising two-front struggle, while concentrating firepower against the right-wing.

　　"The National Question and Leninism" further developed the theory of Marxism-Leninism on the national question and demonstrated the policies of the Bolshevik Party. This work for the first time put forward the principle of a new type of nation formed for the first time in the Soviet Union, namely the socialist nation.

　　The report "Summary of the July Plenum of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" and the speeches "On the Program of the Communist International" and "On the Rightist Danger in the German Communist Party" discussed the tasks of the international revolutionary movement and the fraternal parties. It emphasized the international significance of the Great October Socialist Revolution and Soviet socialist construction, explaining that the New Economic Policy of the Soviet state was a necessary stage in the socialist revolution of all countries.

　　Also included in Volume 11 is Stalin's famous speech "On the Three Characteristics of the Red Army," which pointed out the source of the Red Army's strength and power and prescribed methods for further consolidating the Red Army.

    十一卷包括斯大林一九二八年一月至一九二九年三月的著作。这个时期，布尔什维克党依据国家的社会主义工业化已经获得的成就，坚决执行联共（布）第十五次代表大会所通过的农业集体化方针，为全盘集体化准备了一切必要条件，而阶级斗争也愈加复杂愈加尖锐。
    在“关于中央委员会和中央监察委员会四月联席全会的工作”、“关于联共（布）中央七月全会的总结”、“在粮食战线上”、“论工业化和粮食问题”、“论工农结合和国营农场”、“论粮食收购和农业发展的前途”、“列宁和联合中农问题”等著作中，在苏联列宁共产主义青年团第八次代表大会上的演说中，在“反对把自我批评口号庸俗化”的论文中，斯大林确定了解决粮食问题、建设集体农庄和国营农场、巩固城乡结合的主要途径和方法，论证了迅速发展工业——社会主义和国防的基础的必要性，提出了培养工人阶级出身的新干部的任务，论述了批评和自我批评的意义。认为这是布尔什维克教育干部的方法，是苏维埃社会发展的动力。
    在“致中央政治局各委员”一信中，在“论联共（布）党内的右倾危险”、“论国家工业化和联共（布）党内的右倾”、“布哈林集团和我们党内的右倾”等演说中，在“堕落到极点了”一文和其他著作中，斯大林揭露了右倾投降主义者的富农反革命本质，揭穿了右倾投降主义者和托洛茨基反苏维埃秘密组织的破坏活动，指出必须进行不调和的两条战线的斗争，同时集中火力反对右倾。
    “民族问题和列宁主义”在民族问题方面进一步发展了马克思列宁主义的理论并论证了布尔什维克党的政策。这篇著作第一次提出了关于第一次在苏联形成的新式民族即社会主义民族的原理。
    “关于联共（布）中央七月全会的总结”的报告和“论共产国际纲领”、“论德国共产党内的右倾危险”两篇演说，论述了国际革命运动和各兄弟党的任务。着重指出了伟大十月社会主义革命和苏联社会主义建设的国际意义。说明了苏维埃国家的新经济政策是世界各国社会主义革命必经的阶段。
    编入十一卷的还有斯大林的著名演说“论红军的三个特点”指出了红军的力量和威力的泉源，规定了进一步巩固红军的办法。
