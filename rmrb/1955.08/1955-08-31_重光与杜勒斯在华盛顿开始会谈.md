Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 30th: Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu and U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles began three days of talks in Washington on the 29th.

Dulles and Shigemitsu issued a joint statement after their meeting on the 29th, stating that they had conducted a general discussion on the Far East situation and the international situation, including the Geneva Four-Power Summit. According to Reuters, the U.S. and Japan discussed Japan's rearmament policy, Japan-Soviet negotiations, trade issues, and Japan's desire for the return of islands currently occupied by the United States. The report said that in discussing Japan's foreign relations, Shigemitsu assured Dulles that Japan would not take any action that would "harm" its existing relationship with the United States.

American newspapers have revealed that the U.S. side will demand that Japan undertake more obligations in terms of rearmament during the U.S.-Japan talks. The "New York Times" pointed out on the 28th when talking about the U.S.-Japan talks, "At present, the essence of the problem lies in whether the current Japanese government can persuade the Diet and the people to take the necessary steps to provide an adequate Japanese defense force." The "New York Times" emphasized the need for Japanese conservative parties to establish a "strong and stable" government. It also revealed that the United States "cannot" hand over the Ogasawara Islands and the Ryukyu Islands to Japan for management at this stage, but must be "firmly guarded" by the United States.

　　重光与杜勒斯在华盛顿开始会谈
    新华社三十日讯　华盛顿消息：日本外务相重光葵和美国国务卿杜勒斯二十九日在华盛顿开始举行为期三天的会谈。
    杜勒斯和重光葵在二十九日会谈后发表联合声明说，他们曾就远东形势和日内瓦四国政府首脑会议等国际局势，进行了一般性的讨论。据路透社透露，日美双方在会谈中曾就日本的武装政策、日苏谈判、贸易问题和日本希望归还现由美国占领的各岛屿问题进行了讨论。消息说，在讨论日本对外关系的过程中，重光向杜勒斯保证日本将不会采取“危害”它同美国现存关系的任何行动。
    美国报纸已经透露，美国方面在这次日美会谈中将要求日本在重整军备方面承担更多的义务。“纽约时报”二十八日谈到日美会谈时指出，“在目前，问题的实质在于日本现政府是否能说服国会和人民采取必要的步骤来提供一支充分的日本防御力量”。“纽约时报”强调日本保守党派建立“有力的和稳定的”政府的必要性。它还透露，美国在现阶段“不能够”把小笠原群岛和琉球群岛交给日本管理，而要由美国“牢牢守住”。
