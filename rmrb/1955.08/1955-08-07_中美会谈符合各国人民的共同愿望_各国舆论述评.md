    Sino-US Talks Meet the Common Aspirations of People of All Countries
    ——Commentary on International Public Opinion
    Zhou Meisheng
    Following the Four-Power Summit Conference, the Sino-US Ambassadorial talks, which began on August 1st in Geneva, have once again attracted the attention of the world public. Newspapers in various countries have made these talks the main subject of their commentary. Almost all comments have expressed welcome to this new development in the international situation and have highly valued the significant implications of the talks in easing international tensions.

    The enormous interest that world public opinion has shown in the Sino-US talks is entirely understandable. After the Four-Power Summit Conference, the explosive situation in the Far East, which was not discussed at that conference, has increasingly caused serious concern among the people of all countries. Many countries, especially Asian countries, expressed deep regret that the Four-Power Conference did not discuss the situation in the Far East when commenting on the achievements of the Four-Power Conference. As the Indian "Amrita Bazar Patrika" pointed out, Western countries did not agree to discuss the Far East issue in Geneva, but "everyone knows that there can be no lasting world peace until the political situation in the Far East returns to normal." Starting from this conviction, they demanded that the spirit of cooperation and understanding at the Four-Power Conference be applied to seeking a peaceful resolution of the Far East issues. The proposal to hold a Geneva-style Far East conference to discuss the situation in Asia and the Far East has become a topic of discussion in newspapers in various countries. "The Burma New Light of Rangoon" said in an editorial that in order to ease international tensions and strive for lasting peace in Asia, a Far East conference should be held to discuss the issues in this region. In the United States, according to the British "Sunday Times," the demand for Sino-US talks has also formed an important force in public opinion.

    World opinion regards the Sino-US talks as a promising first step towards a comprehensive solution to the problems of the Far East and Asia and welcomes them wholeheartedly. "The Times of India" believes that "this negotiation will be the first independent diplomatic contact between the two countries (China and the United States), and will undoubtedly be the first step towards further consultations on the political issues of the East." The British "Manchester Guardian" said that the Sino-US talks "could be the first step towards achieving reconciliation in the Far East." Therefore, everyone believes that these talks should not only discuss the issue of civilians returning to their countries between China and the United States, but also discuss other important practical issues in the relations between the two countries, and lay the foundation for further negotiations. It is worth noting that it is not only Asian public opinion that expresses this wish. Many bourgeois newspapers in the United States, obviously due to the strong desire for peace of the American people that cannot be ignored, have also put forward such proposals. For example, "The Washington Post and Times Herald" believes that "the meeting with Beijing must discuss specific issues such as Jinmen, Mazu, Taiwan, and the future recognition of Beijing by the United States." "The New York Herald Tribune" believes that "this meeting can lay the foundation for a broader meeting at a higher level." Obviously, no one should ignore this reasonable desire of the people of all countries.

    "The Rangoon Daily" correctly pointed out the key to whether the Sino-US talks can achieve success. This newspaper said: "As long as both sides can negotiate in good faith, the talks will be successful." Public opinion in various countries has expressed the hope that the spirit of reconciliation shown at the Four-Power Conference can also be reflected in the Sino-US talks. In this regard, the attitude of the Chinese government has been widely welcomed and praised by world opinion. The spirit of reconciliation shown in the speech delivered by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on July 30th and the proposal on concluding a collective peace pact for the Asian and Pacific region have been valued by the people of all countries. Newspapers in Jakarta believe that Premier Zhou Enlai's speech proves that China sincerely desires peace. Public opinion in countries such as India and Burma, which have always advocated the establishment and expansion of peaceful areas in Asia, especially welcomed Premier Zhou Enlai's view on concluding an Asian collective peace pact with the participation of the United States. United Nations personnel believe that the "restrained and conciliatory tone" in this speech "is a new and encouraging contribution to good relations between China and the United States in the future." Public opinion in various countries also warmly welcomed China's early release of eleven American spies in accordance with the law, believing that this measure once again proved China's sincerity in reconciliation. Reuters' commentary is a typical opinion. It said that this decision by China will "clear the way" for further discussions on other issues between China and the United States.

    When many observers in Asia pointed out that Premier Zhou Enlai's speech was a good omen for the success of the Sino-US talks, they focused their attention on the United States' reaction. Public opinion in various countries believes that the US government should show its sincerity with concrete actions in the Sino-US talks. "The Hindustan Standard" said in its editorial that "unless the United States is willing to meet the Chinese side halfway, nothing can contribute to success—not Menon's informal diplomatic activities in Geneva, and not even the (Chinese) release of American pilots." A Tokyo dispatch from the United Press also pointed out when reporting Asian public opinion: "Now it is the United States' turn to make big concessions to ease the danger of war in Asia." "The Indian Express" believes: "Now it is up to the United States to show the wisdom and courage required by the situation."

    It has been noted that some American newspapers are still spreading various kinds of old-fashioned arguments that are incompatible with the current international atmosphere. For example, "The New York Times" of the United States actually described the tense situation in the Far East as "originating from the expansionist pressure of the Chinese Communist Party and the countermeasures taken by the United States," and "The Chicago Tribune" insisted that China "has been forcing" the United States "everywhere for many years." Starting from this untrue argument, some American newspapers are advocating that the Chinese people give up the liberation of Taiwan. "Newsweek" stated: "The United States still insists that the ceasefire must include Jinmen and Mazu," and must include China's "guarantee not to try to seize them by force." "The Daily Mirror" emphasized that the United States should back up its position in the Sino-US talks with strength. "The Philadelphia Inquirer" even described China's conciliatory action of releasing eleven American spies as "a belated correction of a mistake that should never have been made in the first place." These arguments in American newspapers reflect that some Americans are still unwilling to abandon their unrealistic attitude of obstructing the easing of the international situation and dealing with international disputes. This attitude of the United States is very unpopular. It has been justly criticized by fair world opinion. "The Hindustan Standard" criticized the United States' "old set of attitudes of refusal and intransigence," and Singapore's "Sin Chew Jit Poh" hoped that the United States should eliminate the "nitpicking attitude" towards China's conciliatory actions. "Kyodo News" also refuted the wrong view of China's release of American spies. This news agency pointed out that China's release of eleven American spies "cannot be considered merely as an attempt by Communist China to obtain a dramatic publicity effect," and at the same time, it can be considered as China's expression of hope to resolve the disputes between the two countries through consultation in the Sino-US negotiations.

    Public opinion regarding the Sino-US talks shows that after the Four-Power Summit Conference, peace-loving people of all countries are full of confidence in mobilizing the power of public opinion to promote the easing of the international situation. However, they also realize that there will still be many obstacles on the road ahead. The Hungarian "Free People's Daily" called on peace forces to continue their constant struggle in order to promote the Sino-US talks to achieve positive results. There is no doubt that the people of all countries will use the strengthened struggle for peace to make the Sino-US talks an important milestone on the road to easing the situation in the Far East and consolidating world peace.

    中美会谈符合各国人民的共同愿望
    ——各国舆论述评
    周梅生
    继四大国政府首脑会议之后，八月一日开始在日内瓦举行的中美大使级会谈又吸引了世界公众的注意。各国报纸都把这次会谈作为它们评论的主要题目。几乎所有的评论都表示欢迎国际局势中这一新的发展，且对会谈在缓和国际紧张局势方面的重大意义作了很高的估价。
    世界舆论对于中美会谈表现这样巨大的兴趣，是完全可以理解的。在四大国政府首脑会议以后，在这次会议上未能得到讨论的远东地区的爆炸性局势越来越引起各国人民的严重关切，许多国家、特别是亚洲国家的报纸在评论四大国会议的成就的时候，曾经对于四国会议没有讨论远东局势问题深表遗憾。正如印度的“甘露市场报”所指出的，西方国家不同意在日内瓦讨论远东问题，但是，“每个人都知道，在远东的政治局势重新正常以前，是不可能有世界持久和平的”。从这样的信念出发，它们要求把四国会议上的合作和谅解的精神应用于谋求远东问题的和平解决。关于举行一次日内瓦式的远东会议来讨论亚洲和远东的局势的主张，成了各国报纸讨论的题目。“缅甸新光报”在一篇社论中曾经说，为了缓和国际紧张局势和争取亚洲持久和平，应该召开远东会议来讨论这个地区的问题。在美国，据英国“星期日泰晤士报”报道，要求举行中美会谈也已经形成为重要的舆论力量。
    各国舆论把中美会谈看作是走向全面解决远东和亚洲问题的有希望的第一步而予以衷心的欢迎。“印度时报”认为，“这次谈判将是（中美）两国之间第一次独立的外交接触，并且无疑将是走向关于东方的政治问题的进一步协商的第一个步骤。”英国“曼彻斯特卫报”说，中美会谈“可以成为促成远东和解的第一个步骤”。因此，大家认为这次会谈不仅要讨论中美两国平民回国问题，而且应该讨论两国关系中的其他重要的实际问题，并为进一步的谈判奠定基础。值得注意的是：表示这种愿望的不仅仅是亚洲的舆论。美国的许多资产阶级报纸，显然是由于不能不看到的美国人民的强烈的和平愿望，也提出了这样的主张。例如：“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”认为，“同北京的会议必须讨论如金门、马祖、台湾和美国在将来承认北京等具体问题。”“纽约先驱论坛报”认为，“这次会谈可以为在更高的级别上举行的范围更广的会议奠定基础。”显然，任何人都不应该漠视各国人民这种合理的愿望。
    “仰光日报”正确地指出了中美会谈能否获得成就的关键。这家报纸说：“只要双方能够诚意协商，会谈是会有成就的。”各国舆论都表示希望四大国会议上所表现的和解精神能够在中美会谈中同样得到体现。在这方面，中国政府的态度受到了世界舆论的普遍欢迎和赞扬。周恩来总理兼外交部长七月三十日发表的演说所表现的和解精神和关于缔结亚洲和太平洋地区集体和平公约的建议受到了各国人民的重视。雅加达的报纸认为周恩来总理的演说证明中国热诚地渴望和平。一向主张建立和扩大亚洲和平地区的印度和缅甸等国家的舆论特别欢迎周恩来总理关于缔结有美国参加的亚洲集体和平公约的意见。联合国人士认为，这个演说中“有节制的和和解的语气是对将来中国和美国之间的良好关系的一种新的令人鼓舞的贡献”。各国舆论也热烈欢迎中国依法提前释放十一名美国间谍，认为这个措施又一次证明中国的和解诚意。路透社的评论是一种典型的意见。它说，中国这个决定将会为中美进一步讨论其他问题“扫清道路”。
    亚洲的许多观察家在指出周恩来总理的演说是中美会谈成功的吉兆时，都集中注意美国的反应。各国舆论都认为，美国政府在中美会谈中应该以具体的行动来表明它的诚意。“印度斯坦旗报”在它的社论中说，“除非美国愿意在中途迎接中国方面的前进，否则，没有任何东西能够有助于成功——梅农在日内瓦继续进行的非正式外交活动不行，甚至于（中国）释放美国飞行员也不行”。合众社的一则东京电讯在报道亚洲舆论时也指出：“现在轮到美国作大大的让步来缓和亚洲的战争危险了”。“印度快报”认为：“现在要由美国来表示局势所要求的明智和勇气了。”
    人们注意到，某些美国的报纸仍在散布着各种各样的和当前的国际气氛不协调的陈旧的论调。例如，美国“纽约时报”竟把远东的紧张局势说成是“起源于中国共产党的扩张压力以及美国采取的对策”，“芝加哥论坛报”硬说中国“多年来一直在处处逼迫”美国。从这种不合事实的论调出发，美国某些报刊正在宣传要中国人民放弃解放台湾。“新闻周刊”表示：“美国仍旧坚持停火必须包括金门和马祖在内”，必须包括中国“保证不试图用武力夺取它们”。“每日镜报”强调美国在中美会谈中应该以实力地位为后盾。“费城问询报”甚至把中国释放十一名美国间谍的和解行动说成是“为时已晚地纠正首先就决不应该犯的一个错误”。美国报纸的这些论调，反映了某些美国人士仍然不肯放弃他们那种阻挠国际局势缓和以及处理国际纠纷时的不现实的态度。美国这种态度是非常不受欢迎的。它受到了世界公正舆论的正当的指责。“印度斯坦旗报”就批评了美国的“拒绝和不妥协的老一套态度”，新加坡的“星洲日报”希望：美国应该消除对中国的和解行动所抱的那种“吹毛求疵的态度”，“共同社”也驳斥了对中国释放美国间谍的错误看法。这家通讯社指出：中国释放美国十一名间谍“不能认为仅是共产党中国企图获得戏剧性的宣传效果”，同时可以认为这是中国表示希望在中美谈判中以协商方式解决两国的争端。
    关于中美会谈的公众舆论表明：在四大国政府首脑会议之后，爱好和平的各国人民对于动员舆论的力量来促使国际局势的缓和充满着信心。但是，他们也认识到，在前进的道路上还会有不少的障碍。匈牙利“自由人民报”要求和平力量继续进行不断的斗争，以便促使中美会谈获得积极的结果。毫无疑问，各国人民将用加强争取和平的斗争，使中美会谈成为缓和远东局势和巩固世界和平的道路上的一个重要里程碑。
