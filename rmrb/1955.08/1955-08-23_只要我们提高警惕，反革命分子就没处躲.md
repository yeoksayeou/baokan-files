As long as we raise our vigilance, counter-revolutionaries will have nowhere to hide
Sun Yongjiang, worker of the Fine Spinning Section of the State-owned Shanghai No. 10 Cotton Textile Factory

    This was back in January 1953. At that time, the fine spinning frames repaired by the maintenance section of the fine spinning workshop often had problems. Sometimes the belts overheated, sometimes the spring teeth jumped, and the maintenance section's plans were often not completed, which also affected the completion of the fine spinning workshop's production tasks. What was the reason for this? A knot formed in my mind, and I suspected that this might be sabotage by counter-revolutionaries! I told the Party branch secretary about it, and the Party branch secretary said, "We should raise our vigilance." He told me to pay attention and contact the security section more often if there were any developments. I did as the branch secretary told me.

    Once, six of us were repairing a machine, and we were supposed to have it repaired by 4:30 in the afternoon. By 4:30, five of us had finished our work, but only Chen Asi's work was not done. He kept working on his own until 5:00. After work that day, I was concerned about that machine. At 9:00 in the evening, I went to the workshop again to see how the machine was running. When I walked into the workshop, alas! The fine spinning frame that had just been repaired had a problem again. When we checked, it turned out that the problem was that the spring wrench was not tightened. This was the work that Chen Asi had done. At the time, I was very suspicious: according to Chen Asi's skills, this work should not have had any problems.

    Before liberation, Chen Asi was a hooligan, and many people suffered at his hands. He also participated in the reactionary organization "Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction Committee." After liberation, he instigated workers behind the scenes to refuse to promote the 1953 textile machine maintenance work method, and he also falsely accused worker Yu Fahua in the name of the group. However, in front of people, he pretended to be very honest, and in front of Party members, he always behaved very actively. He also said to me, "Old Sun, help me more, I also want to strive to join the Party." I thought that we must be vigilant against this kind of person.

    The next day, at the group meeting, I criticized Chen Asi: "You shouldn't have made a mistake, causing an accident and causing losses to the country." Chen Asi nodded repeatedly and said, "I was careless, I will make a self-criticism." However, after lunch, Wang Huaibao, who ate at the same table as Chen Asi, ran over and told me that Chen Asi said while eating: "Self-criticism is self-criticism, after the self-criticism, it's over!" A few days later, the newly repaired No. 38 machine had a problem again. After checking, it was because Chen Asi had tightened the screw cap too tightly during operation. At the group meeting, Chen Asi again put on a self-criticism face and said, "I was too careless, I must improve in the future." At this time, I became even more suspicious, and I reported all these situations to the security section.

    Another day, we were repairing No. 12 machine. That morning at 7:00, a Party branch meeting was to be held. I worked for a while and then went to attend the meeting. After half an hour of the meeting, I was worried because there were only Chen Asi and a few other people in the workshop. I was afraid that Chen Asi would play tricks, so I ran back to the workshop to take a look. When I returned to the workshop, hey, there was no one in the workshop! I ran to the substation maintenance room, where Chen Asi and a few others were having a meeting! When Chen Asi saw me coming, he pretended to be stupid and said, "Why can't I find the 5-cent screw." While saying this, he slipped away. The others also followed him away. As a result, I became even more vigilant: Chen Asi was still trying to win people over!

    Since being caught by me, Chen Asi and those people could no longer be seen gathering together in the factory. However, I saw some people running to Zhao Chunshan's house. One day I asked the Young League member Xu Weifu to go to Zhao Chunshan's house to visit. When he took a look, hey, sure enough, those people were all at Zhao Chunshan's house.

    After this, accidents continued to happen, and the problems that occurred were not ones that could be discovered immediately. At one point, we even received several anonymous letters, all of which cursed the Party members and League members in the fine spinning workshop.

    One day in June last year, Wei Jinsheng, who was very close to Chen Asi, ran over to me angrily and said, "Old Sun, it's been several years since liberation, and I'm still being oppressed!" "Who is oppressing you?" "Chen Asi! Just think, he borrowed my money, but he refuses to pay it back." After that, I paid attention to getting closer to Wei Jinsheng, playing with him, and chatting with him. Before liberation, Wei Jinsheng had lung disease and had no money to treat it. After liberation, he had labor insurance, which cured his illness. I used this to enlighten his class consciousness and also told him how counter-revolutionaries were sabotaging us, enlightening him to raise his revolutionary vigilance. After a few months, Wei Jinsheng became familiar with me and told me a lot of information about Chen Asi's activities behind the scenes. For example, Chen Asi said to them: "Party members and League members often hold meetings to deal with us, so we also hold meetings to deal with them." Chen Asi told them to write anonymous letters; he told them not to speak at meetings, or to agree to attack Party members and League members together. Chen Asi also intentionally sowed discord between Party members and workers. Once I was sick and resting at home, Chen Asi said to Wei Jinsheng: "We are working so hard, but the Party members are comfortable, lying at home and still getting paid." He wanted everyone to go to the theater at night, and the next day they would not have the energy to work and would ask for leave. He also said to Cui Fengxiang, who had been struggled against for corruption during the "Three-Anti" campaign: "How did they treat you during the Three-Anti campaign? If you don't counterattack now, when will you!"

    One day in August 1954, there was almost a serious accident again. When repairing the machine, I worked quickly and went to help Chen Asi pull the oil line belt. Unexpectedly, when I pulled it, the belt pulley shaft shook. Before I could figure out what was going on, Chen Asi hurriedly snatched it over and tightened a screw on the belt pulley shaft, saying:
    "Careless, careless." If the screw on the belt pulley shaft is not tightened, the belt pulley and the drum will rub against each other when the machine is started, which may cause a fire.

    Afterwards, I thought about this matter again and again. Why didn't Chen Asi tighten the screw on the belt pulley shaft? Was this negligence? No, this was not negligence! If it was negligence, why did he rush to tighten the screw when I went to pull the oil line belt? This must be intentional sabotage!

    I reported this situation to the security section. At this time, the security section also had a lot of materials on Chen Asi's counter-revolutionary activities. In December 1954, the people's government arrested this counter-revolutionary element according to law. The interrogation confirmed that this bad egg was a hidden counter-revolutionary element. Now, this counter-revolutionary element has been sentenced to imprisonment by the people's court.

　　只要我们提高警惕，反革命分子就没处躲
　　国营上海第十棉纺织厂细纱间保全部工人　孙永江
    这还是在一九五三年一月份。那时候，细纱间保全部平过的细纱车常常发生毛病，一会儿皮带发热了，一会儿弹簧牙齿跳了，保全部的计划老完不成，也影响到细纱间的生产任务的完成。这是什么原因呢？我思想上起了一个疙瘩，疑心这会不会是反革命分子的破坏！我给党支部书记一说，党支部书记说：“应该提高警惕。”他叫我留心着，有什么情况多和保卫科联系。我就照着支部书记的话去做。
    有一次，我们六个人平一台车，规定是下午四点半钟平好。到了四点半钟，我们五个人的活都做好了，只有陈阿四的活没有做好。他一个人直做到五点钟。这天下了班，我心里记挂着这台车。晚上九点钟，我又到车间去看开车的情况。走进车间一看，唉！这台刚刚平好的细纱车又出了毛病。我们一检查，原来毛病出在弹簧扳手没有拧紧。这个活就是陈阿四做的。当时我很怀疑：按照陈阿四的技术来说，这个活是不会出毛病的。
    陈阿四这个人，解放以前是个流氓，很多人吃过他的苦头，他还参加过反动组织“戡乱建国委员会”。解放后，他在背后煽动过工人拒绝推广一九五三年纺织机器保全工作法，还假冒小组的名义诬告过工人俞发华。可是，在人面前他装得很老实，在党员面前总是表现得很积极。他还对我说：“老孙，你多帮助帮助我，我也要争取入党。”我想对这种人，不能不提高警惕。
    第二天，在小组会上，我批评了陈阿四：“你不该做错活，发生了事故，使国家受损失。”陈阿四连连点头说：“是我大意了，我要检讨。”可是，吃过中饭以后，同陈阿四一桌吃饭的王淮宝跑来告诉我说，陈阿四在吃饭的时候说：“检讨管检讨，检讨过了拉倒！”过了几天，刚平好的三十八号车又出了毛病。一检查，又是因为陈阿四在操作时把螺丝帽拧得太紧了。在小组会上，陈阿四又摆出一付检讨面孔说：“我太大意了，以后一定要改进。”这时候，我就更起了疑心，我把这些情况都向保卫科汇报了。
    另一天，我们平十二号车。那天上午七点钟要开党支部大会，我做了一会活就去参加会议了。开了半个钟头会，我心里不放心，因为车间里只有陈阿四和别的几个人。我怕陈阿四搞鬼，就跑回车间去看一看。回到车间一看，嘿，车间里一个人都没有！我跑到变线间保全室，原来陈阿四和几个人在那里开会哩！陈阿四看见我来了，就假痴假呆地说：“五分螺丝怎么找不到了。”一边说一边溜走了。别的人也跟着走了。这样一来，我更加警惕了：陈阿四还在拉拢人呢！
    自从被我撞到以后，在厂里再看不见陈阿四和那几个人聚在一堆了。但是，我又看见有些人向赵春山家里跑。有一天我叫青年团员许伟富到赵春山家里去探望一下。他一看，嘿，果然他们几个人都在赵春山家里。
      这以后，事故还是不断发生，而且出的毛病都不是一时能发现的。有一个时候，还接到了几封无头信，都是骂细纱间的党员和团员的。
    去年六月里的一天，同陈阿四很接近的韦金生气呼呼地跑来对我说：“老孙，解放几年了，我还受人家压迫呢！”“谁压迫你呢？”“陈阿四呀！你想，他借了我的钱，却死不肯还。”以后我就注意多去接近韦金生，同他一起玩，一起谈天。解放以前韦金生生了肺病没有钱医，解放以后有了劳动保险，把他的病治好了。我就拿这来启发他的阶级觉悟，还告诉他反革命分子怎样来破坏我们，启发他提高革命警惕性。过了几个月，韦金生同我熟了，就告诉我很多关于陈阿四背地里活动的材料。例如：陈阿四对他们说：“党员、团员常常开会来对付我们，我们也来开会对付他们。”陈阿四叫他们写无头信；叫他们开会不要发言，或者约齐了一起攻击党员、团员。陈阿四还有意地在党员和工人中间挑拨离间，有一次我病了在家里休息，陈阿四就对韦金生说：“我们做得吃力煞，党员倒写意，躺在家里照样拿工钱。”他要大家晚上去看戏，第二天没有精神做活就请假。他还对“三反”时因贪污被斗争过的崔凤祥说：“三反时候，他们对你怎么样？现在不反攻，等到什么时候！”
      一九五四年八月有一天，又差一点出了一次严重的事故。在平车的时候，我活做得快，就去帮陈阿四拉油线带，不料，一拉，带盘轴就摇起来了。在我还没有弄清楚这是怎么一回事的时候，陈阿四却慌忙抢过来把一根带盘轴的螺丝拧紧，嘴里说：
  “大意，大意。”带盘轴的螺丝不拧紧，一开车，带盘和滚筒发生磨擦，就可能烧起来。
    过后，我对这桩事情想了又想，陈阿四为什么不把带盘轴的螺丝拧紧？这是不是疏忽？不，这不是疏忽！如果是疏忽，为什么我去拉油线带的时候，他就抢着把螺丝拧紧？这一定是故意破坏！
    我把这个情况向保卫科汇报了。这时保卫科也掌握了陈阿四很多反革命活动的材料。一九五四年十二月份，人民政府依法把这个反革命分子逮捕了。审讯证实这个坏蛋就是一个暗藏的反革命分子。现在，这个反革命分子已经被人民法院判了徒刑。
