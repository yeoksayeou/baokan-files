Countries Attach Importance to Premier Zhou's Report on China's Foreign Policy

    India
      The "Hindustan Times" wrote that Delhi welcomes the speech by Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, in which Zhou Enlai suggested that countries in Asia and the Pacific region, including the United States, sign a collective peace pact. It is believed that this speech is a good omen for the Sino-US talks to be held in Geneva on August 1.
    Delhi officials and political figures pointed out that Zhou Enlai specifically mentioned that the proposed convention should be based on the principles suggested by Indian Prime Minister Nehru.
    Local observers noted with great satisfaction Zhou Enlai's proposal to negotiate with the Taiwan local authorities.
    United News of India reported on July 31 that Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal for countries in Asia and the Pacific region to sign a collective peace pact was "immediately welcomed in Delhi." The news said that everyone believes this is a "good omen" for the ambassadorial-level talks between China and the United States in Geneva.
      Czech "Red Right Newspaper"
      "Red Right Newspaper" commented on the start of the Sino-US ambassadorial-level talks on the 1st, saying: All peace-loving countries hope that the talks between the United States and China in Geneva will achieve good results, because the success of the talks will make an important contribution to the easing of tension between the United States and China.
    The newspaper pointed out that world public opinion is deeply convinced that if both sides make efforts, the negotiations will produce positive results. This belief has been further strengthened by Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the National People's Congress meeting on July 30. It is believed that Premier Zhou Enlai's speech is another manifestation of the Chinese people's goodwill to resolve international disputes peacefully. Zhou Enlai's speech shows that in the upcoming Geneva talks, China can be expected to guarantee the success of the negotiations with the utmost sincerity and effort.
    "Red Right Newspaper" emphasized that if the United States withdraws its armed forces from Taiwan, stops invading China's airspace, and stops conducting military exercises, it will make a great contribution to the cause of peace and the normalization of international relations in the Far East.
    Yugoslav "Combat Newspaper"
    A commentator for the Yugoslav "Combat Newspaper" wrote: Undeniably, the wording of the Chinese Premier's speech is moderate, tolerant, and realistic. The commentator said that Zhou Enlai's words did not have any tendency to cause controversy. On the contrary, he reaffirmed the Chinese government's desire to resolve disputes with all other countries—including the United States—through negotiations. Zhou Enlai confirmed the direction of China's policy with this speech, and statements about this policy direction had a good impression at the Bandung Conference, and have been successfully and satisfactorily implemented in the relations between China and certain other neighboring countries.
    The commentator said that one cannot say that the Chinese Premier's expression of concern about the implementation of the resolutions of the Geneva Conference last year is completely inappropriate. The commentator pointed out that the responsibilities of other countries participating in the Geneva and other agreements in implementing the agreements are no less than China's.
    The commentator concluded that we should not only ask China to provide proof of goodwill, but also quickly take steps to recognize its right to enjoy its due place in international life.
    British Public and Newspapers
    The British government did not immediately comment on Premier Zhou's speech, but well-informed British sources believe that the speech is beneficial, its tone is quite moderate, and it helps to briefly explain China's policy.
    On July 31, the London "Sunday Times" published an article by Nicholas Carroll, saying: Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai said in an important foreign policy speech in Beijing yesterday that China is willing to hold negotiations with the "responsible authorities in Taiwan," but warned the United States not to "interfere in China's internal affairs." He emphasized that the negotiations with the Chiang Kai-shek government will "negotiate steps for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan." The Beijing government firmly opposes "any idea and practice of so-called two Chinas." The article also pointed out that Premier Zhou also advocated that countries in Asia and the Pacific region sign a collective peace pact to replace the current antagonistic military blocs.
    On the same day, the "Observer" also published a Beijing dispatch from its reporter Dennis Bloodworth. In this dispatch, the reporter said: The tone of Zhou Enlai's report on foreign affairs is moderate and conciliatory, and he takes the necessity of resolving international disputes through negotiation as his theme.

    各国重视周总理关于我国外交政策报告
    印　度
      “印度斯坦旗报”写道，德里欢迎中华人民共和国国务院总理兼外交部长周恩来的发言，周恩来在发言中建议，亚洲和太平洋地区的国家，包括美国在内签订一个集体和平公约。人们认为，这个发言是八月一日将在日内瓦开始举行的中美会谈的良好预兆。
    德里官方人士和政界人士指出：周恩来特别谈到，拟议中的公约应当以印度总理尼赫鲁所建议的原则为基础。
    当地的观察家极为满意地指出周恩来提出的关于同台湾地方当局谈判的建议。
    印度统一通讯社七月三十一日报道，周恩来总理的发言中的关于亚洲和太平洋地区国家签订集体和平公约的主张“在德里立刻受到欢迎”。消息说，大家认为这是中国和美国在日内瓦举行的大使级谈判的“吉兆”。
      捷“红色权利报”
      “红色权利报”一日就中美两国大使级会谈开始发表评论说：所有爱好和平的国家都希望美国和中国在日内瓦的会谈获得良好结果，因为会谈的成功将对美国和中国间的紧张关系的缓和作出重要的贡献。
    报纸指出，世界公众深信，如果双方都作出努力，谈判就会产生积极的结果，这种信念由于周恩来总理七月三十日在中国人民代表大会会议上的发言而更为加强了。人们认为，周恩来总理的发言是中国人民愿意以和平方式解决国际争端的善意的又一次表现。周恩来的发言表明，在即将到来的日内瓦谈判中，可以期望中国将以最大的诚意和努力来保证谈判的成功。
    “红色权利报”着重说，如果美国从台湾撤退它的武装部队，停止侵犯中国的领空和停止进行军事演习，就会对和平事业和远东国际关系的正常化作出巨大贡献。
    南斯拉夫“战斗报”
    南斯拉夫“战斗报”评论员写道：无可争论地，中国总理发言的措辞是温和的、容忍的和现实主义的。评论员说，周恩来的话是没有任何引起争论的倾向的，恰恰相反，他重申了中国政府要通过谈判的方法来解决同一切其他国家——包括美国在内——的争端的愿望。周恩来以这篇演说证实了中国政策的方针，而关于这种政策方针的声明曾在万隆会议上产生了良好的印象，而且在中国和某些其他邻国间的关系中已经得到顺利的并且为双方满意的执行。
    评论员说，不能说中国总理谈到去年的日内瓦会议的决议的执行情况时表示的忧虑是完全不适当的。评论员指出，参加日内瓦和其他协定的其他国家在执行协定方面所承担的责任并不比中国的责任小一些。
    评论员最后说，我们不应单单要求中国提供善意的证明，而且也应当赶快采取步骤来承认它在国际生活中享有它应当享有的权利。
    英国公众和报纸
    英国官方没有立刻就周总理的发言发表评论，但是消息灵通的英国人士认为：这个发言是有益的，它的语气是相当温和的，它有助于扼要说明中国的政策。
    七月三十一日，伦敦“星期日泰晤士报”登载了尼古拉斯·卡罗尔的一篇文章说：中国外交部长周恩来先生昨天在北京发表的重要的外交政策演说中说，中国愿意同“台湾地方的负责当局”举行谈判，但是警告美国不要“干涉中国的内政”。他着重指出，同蒋介石政府进行的谈判将“协商和平解放台湾的步骤”。北京政府坚决反对“所谓两个中国的任何想法和做法”。文章并且指出，周总理在发言中还主张亚洲和太平洋地区的国家签订一个集体和平公约来代替目前的对立性的军事集团。
    同日，“观察家报”也登载了它的记者丹尼斯·布拉德—沃思的一篇北京通讯。这个记者在这篇通讯里说：周恩来关于外交问题的报告的语气是温和的和和解性的，他把用谈判方法来解决国际纠纷的必要性作为他的主题。　（据新华社讯）
