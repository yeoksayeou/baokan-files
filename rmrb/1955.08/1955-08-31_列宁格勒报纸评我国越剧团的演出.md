Leningrad Newspapers Review the Performances of Our Yue Opera Troupe

　　This dispatch from our Leningrad office, dated August 30th, reports that after a ten-day visit and performance tour in Leningrad, the Chinese Yue Opera Troupe departed for Sverdlovsk on August 28th. In Leningrad, the Yue Opera Troupe performed "The West Chamber," "The Butterfly Lovers," and several short plays, receiving enthusiastic welcomes from the audience. On August 25th, the "Leningrad Pravda" published an article entitled "The Art of a Great People," reviewing the performance of "The West Chamber." The article stated that the psychology of the beautiful Cui Yingying is complex and multifaceted. The talented actress Yuan Xuefen... portrayed Yingying's image, overflowing with the poetic essence of a young girl's pure love. Although Yingying's form of expressing emotions has a somewhat suggestive nature, Yuan Xuefen's acting is moving and convincing, created by true genius. In the art of the Yue Opera Troupe's actors, every detail is full of expressiveness. Not only the musical language, graceful postures, and profound expressions, but even the movements of the hands, convey the characters' thoughts and feelings. Where the magical fingers touch, still objects come to life. The fans in the hands of Yingying and Hongniang fly like butterflies. The letters in the hands of Yingying, Zhang Gong, and Hongniang are also like living things. The long sleeves are closely connected to the lives of the roles being played. The sleeves sometimes rise upwards, expressing the joy of the characters, and sometimes hang down helplessly, expressing the characters' great disappointment. This is how the Chinese drama stage expresses itself with unique and ingenious techniques.
　　On August 26th, the "Leningrad Evening News" published an article reviewing "The Butterfly Lovers." The author wrote:

　　"The Butterfly Lovers" left an indelible impression on people. The unique form of performance, based on wonderful folk songs, a charming and poetic symbolic movements and realistic life representation are blended together. The actors' skillful techniques, as well as the art decoration with delicate style - all of these are perfect. The actors are grasping the art with that confident strength, thus completely revealing the inner world of the roles they play and their feelings and thoughts to the audience. (Su Lan)

　　列宁格勒报纸评我国越剧团的演出
    本报列宁格勒三十日电　中国越剧团在列宁格勒访问演出十天后，已于八月二十八日启程赴斯维德洛夫斯克。在列宁格勒，越剧团曾演出了
  “西厢记”、“梁山伯与祝英台”和几个短剧，受到了观众的热烈欢迎。八月二十五日，“列宁格勒真理报”发表了一篇题为“伟大人民的艺术”的文章，评“西厢记”的演出。文章说，美丽的崔莺莺的心理是复杂而多方面的。天才的女演员袁雪芬……所扮演的莺莺的形象，洋溢着少女的纯洁爱情的诗意，虽然莺莺表露情感的形式带有一些暗示的性质，但是袁雪芬的演技是打动人心的，同时是使人信服那是由真正的天才所创造出来的。在越剧团演员的艺术中，每一个细节都富于表现力。不仅是音乐般的语言、优美的体态、深刻的表情，甚至手的动作，都传达着人物的思想和感情。富有魔力的手指触到的地方，静物都开始活起来了。莺莺和红娘手中的扇子像蝴蝶一样飞来飞去。莺莺、张珙和红娘手中的信也像活的东西一样。长长的衣袖是与扮演的角色的生活息息相连的。衣袖有时向上扬起，表示剧中人的喜悦，有时束手无策地下垂，表示角色大失所望。中国戏剧场面上就是这样以独特的、机智的手法来表达的。
    八月二十六日，“列宁格勒晚报”刊登了一篇评“梁山伯与祝英台”的文章。作者写道：
  “梁山伯与祝英台”给人们留下了不可磨灭的印象。基于绝妙的民间歌曲的音乐，迷人的、诗意的象征性的动作与现实的生活表现溶汇在一起的独特表演形式，演员的娴熟的技巧，以及具有细致风格的艺术装饰——这一切，都是尽善尽美的。演员是以那种自信的力量在掌握着艺术，因而把扮演的角色的内心世界和他们的感情和思想，完全表露在观众的面前。　（苏兰）
