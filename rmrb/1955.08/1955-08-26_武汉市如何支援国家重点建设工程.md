    How Wuhan Supports National Key Construction Projects
    Office of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Wuhan is one of the important industrial cities of the country. During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, the state will build several large-scale modern key projects here. To ensure the successful completion of these industrial constructions and put them into production in a timely manner, just like fighting a war, on the one hand, we must rely on the hard work of the frontline basic construction teams (including surveying, design, and construction); on the other hand, we must also rely on the active and proactive cooperation and support from all organs and departments and the broad masses of people throughout the country, especially in Wuhan. The scope of support for basic construction units is extremely broad, such as urban planning, especially industrial zone planning, urban construction, land acquisition, resident relocation, labor allocation, supply of local building materials, cooperation between industrial departments, water and electricity supply, transportation, trade cooperation, culture, education, health, public security, and judiciary, which almost relate to all aspects of the city's work. Only when these aspects can actively and proactively cooperate and support can the completion of industrial construction tasks be guaranteed.
    
    Strengthening political and ideological work and establishing the idea of serving industrial construction is the guarantee for doing a good job in supporting work
    
    To mobilize and organize the strength of the entire city to support the country's key construction projects, we must first carry out political and ideological education, especially education for cadres, to enhance everyone's socialist awareness, so as to strengthen the unity and cooperation between supporting units and construction units. In 1954, on the basis of the general line education, we conducted propaganda and education on supporting industrial construction to the broad masses of cadres and people in the city. However, this alone is not enough. In specific work, we should also conduct education targeting various different ideas, support correct ideas, and criticize wrong ideas. For example, in terms of supporting units, many units used to think that supporting work was not their task, but was adding trouble to themselves; some units thought that basic construction work was difficult to do, with large changes and urgent needs, which could easily disrupt their own work plans, so they pushed it around and dealt with it carelessly; some units did not actively and proactively serve the construction units, but waited passively; some units overemphasized difficulties, simply complaining about "bitterness", without fully utilizing existing conditions, tapping potential, and overcoming difficulties; some units had varying degrees of departmentalism and capitalist ideas, supporting when it was beneficial to themselves, and not supporting when it was not beneficial, and even taking advantage of supporting work to benefit from the construction units. In construction units, there were also expressions of departmentalism, such as thinking that they were the main body, requiring others to obey them in everything, wanting others to find solutions for everything, and not actively solving problems that they could solve themselves, nor proposing solutions; and making very high demands. Therefore, the Party organization must constantly educate all staff members, establish the idea of serving the country's industrial construction, and criticize various wrong ideas and wrong styles. The Party organization should educate construction units and supporting units to actively support each other, cooperate closely, and carry out criticism and self-criticism; for some problems, they should be considerate of each other, rather than blaming each other, so that everyone understands that strengthening unity is the key to doing a good job in supporting work.
    
    The Party organization should also strengthen the supervision and inspection of support work. In May of this year, the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee jointly convened a meeting on supporting basic construction work, at which they criticized the units that did not provide sufficient support, commended the units that did a good job in supporting work, and exchanged experiences. After the meeting, the support work of various departments has improved somewhat.
    
    Organizing the staff and workers of supporting units and construction units to educate each other and encourage the enthusiasm of the masses is also a very important political task. In this regard, we have adopted the following methods: 1. Organizing visits and consolations, which can both encourage the confidence of basic construction workers in completing construction tasks, and enable the staff of supporting units to recognize the importance of supporting work and ensure the effort to complete supporting tasks. 2. Organizing basic construction sites and production workers to propose guarantees for carrying out competitions, so as to encourage and supervise each other. 3. Organizing communication between construction units and supporting units, especially when the engineering tasks are tight and the work is difficult, organizing rear workers to write letters to encourage frontline basic construction workers, and basic construction workers also frequently write letters to the rear to report on their work and make requests. In this way, they can promote each other and move forward together.
    
    Strengthening the planning and organizational leadership of support work to reverse the passive situation
    
    In the past two years (1953 and 1954), the industrial construction in Wuhan area was generally in the preparatory stage, involving a small scope. This year, the construction units have successively entered the construction stage, so the support tasks have gradually become heavier. At the beginning, on the one hand, the construction units could not come up with a plan, and they had to deal with it as it came; or the plan was too large and too far away, and unrealistic; on the other hand, the relevant supporting units in Wuhan City lacked preparation in terms of ideology, organization, and specific measures, so the support work appeared to be very passive. Some construction sites were already going to acquire land, but we had not yet formulated a plan for relocating farmers; the workers at some construction sites had already gathered, but the supply of grain, oil, salt, and daily necessities was still a problem. Construction units sent a large number of people to negotiate everywhere all day long, and the supporting departments also felt that there were too many clues and too many changes, which were difficult to cope with. After several studies, and the following tasks were carried out, the passive and chaotic situation was gradually reversed.
    
    This spring, the Municipal Party Committee convened a mobilization meeting for relevant urban units, and organized 31 relevant units to conduct investigations and visits to various construction units, especially key construction units. Through this investigation, not only did the supporting units understand the situation and specifically feel the importance of the supporting tasks and thus begin to attach importance to the supporting work, but also through the investigation, both parties established contact. The urban supporting units repeatedly consulted with the construction units to formulate plans for support and service, and the Municipal People's Committee then reviewed and comprehensively balanced the plans of the various units, so that the supporting work could be carried out in a more planned manner.
    
    There are many basic construction units in Wuhan, and first of all, we should pay attention to grasping the problems of several main units for research and resolution. There are also many aspects of supporting work, but among them, urban planning, urban construction, building materials, transportation, labor allocation, and commodity supply are the most important. Therefore, we first paid attention to studying and solving these aspects of the problem.
    
    There are many problems in various construction units. In addition to many special problems that they cannot solve themselves, the urban support departments should contract separately, establish direct contact with the construction units, and be responsible for solving the problems. In fact, as long as the supporting units seriously manage it and strengthen business guidance to the construction units, many problems can be solved. For example, the Qingshan construction site has been shouting about the lack of medical personnel. After the Municipal Health Bureau took charge of the health work of the construction site, it calculated the existing manpower of each unit and organized them in a unified manner. As a result, it was found that only some medicines needed to be subsidized to solve the problem, and there was still surplus power.
    
    In the past, many construction units did not have a dedicated person in charge of managing this work, and when problems occurred temporarily, they sent people to grab them randomly. Although the supporting units were very enthusiastic, they also did not have a dedicated person in charge of this work, so many supporting work was squeezed out by daily business. Now each construction unit has determined a responsible comrade to uniformly grasp this work, and each supporting unit, in addition to being personally grasped by one of the responsible persons, has also established a special agency to specifically manage the supporting business. At present, 46 supporting units and 11 construction units in the city have established special management agencies. The Municipal People's Committee's Basic Construction Office is uniformly responsible for the city's support and collaboration, so that the support work has gradually become organized.
    
    Since this spring, after strengthening these tasks, the passive situation of supporting work has gradually been reversed. The supporting units have begun to attach importance to the supporting work and include the supporting plan in their own work plan; the construction units have also actively cooperated with the supporting units. In this way, many problems are easy to solve. For example, the problem of changing the voltage line at the Hanyang construction site of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. Originally, the Wuhan Metallurgical Electric Power Bureau emphasized the difficulties, and negotiations did not solve it for two months. Later, the construction site sent technicians to study with the Electric Power Bureau and was responsible for solving the material problems. As a result, three workers solved the problem in one day. However, because our grasp of the situation of basic construction units is not accurate enough, we lack experience in this area, the situation of basic construction projects changes greatly, and there are many clues. To completely reverse the passive situation, we need to work harder.
    
    To support basic construction, we must tap internal potential
    
    Supporting the country's industrial construction and ensuring the successful completion of industrial construction is a great encouragement to the Party organizations and the people of the city, and it is the driving force for promoting various tasks in the city. Moreover, after each department undertakes the task of supporting basic construction, the task is increased, the quality requirements of the work are very high, and the time requirements are also very urgent. If we do not improve our work and tap internal potential, we will not be able to complete the supporting tasks. At the beginning, many departments believed that since the task was increased, the establishment should be expanded and the equipment should be increased. This idea is not realistic. It should be said that our potential is very large, and we should give play to the existing potential strength to support industrial construction. According to this spirit, each unit went deep into the bottom to calculate, mobilize the masses to find ways to improve the work, and the result proved that as long as we earnestly tap the potential strength, we can complete the supporting tasks well. For example, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge construction site required the Wuhan Ship Repair Factory to manufacture three pontoons and five iron barges. At the beginning, the Ship Repair Factory did not dare to accept these tasks. Indeed, according to the technical equipment capacity of the factory in the past, which could only repair and patch up, it was difficult to undertake this task. However, because they specially organized an inspection team to go deep into the bottom to tap the potential, and the Ferry Company transferred an engineer to support the factory, the Ship Repair Factory finally accepted this task, completed the design of all the hulls and auxiliary equipment in a timely manner, and began to prepare for the relevant production work. The transportation department strengthened the planning of management work, mobilized the masses to improve the efficiency of automobile transportation and the utilization rate of ships, and ensured the completion of the transportation tasks of basic construction, especially key construction projects.

    武汉市如何支援国家重点建设工程
    中共武汉市委办公厅
    武汉市是国家重要的工业城市之一。在第一个五年计划期间，国家将要在这里兴建几个规模巨大的现代化的重点工程。要保证这些工业建设胜利完成并及时投入生产，正像打仗一样，一方面要靠前方基本建设队伍（包括勘测、设计、施工）的艰苦奋斗；一方面还要靠全国特别是武汉市各机关各部门以及广大人民群众积极的主动的协作支援。对基本建设单位的支援工作范围极其广阔，诸如城市规划，特别是工业区规划、城市建设、土地征收、居民搬迁、劳动力调配、地方建筑材料的供应、工业部门之间的协作、供水供电、交通运输、贸易合作、文教卫生、公安司法，几乎关系到全市各个方面的工作。只有这些方面都能够主动积极地协作支援，才能保证工业建设任务的完成。
    加强政治思想工作，树立为工业建设服务的思想是做好支援工作的保证
    要动员和组织全市的力量来支援国家的重点建设工程，首先要进行政治思想教育，特别是对干部的教育，提高大家的社会主义觉悟，才能加强支援单位和建设单位的团结协作。一九五四年在总路线教育的基础上，我们曾经向广大干部和全市人民进行了支援工业建设的宣传教育。但，仅仅这些还是不够的。在具体工作中还应针对各种不同的思想进行教育，支持正确思想，批判错误思想。比方在支援单位方面，曾有不少单位认为支援工作不是自己的任务，是给自己增加麻烦；有些单位认为基本建设工作不好做，变动大，要得急，容易打乱自己的工作计划，因而东推西推，马虎应付；有些单位不是主动积极为建设单位服务，而是消极等待；有些单位过分强调困难，单纯叫“苦”，而不去充分运用现有条件，挖掘潜力，克服困难，有些单位有不同程度的本位主义思想和资本主义思想，对自己有利时就支援，没利时就不支援，甚至还有借支援工作而向建设单位揩油的。在建设单位中，也表现出有本位主义思想的，如认为自己是主体，处处要别人服从自己，事事要别人想办法，自己能解决的问题也不主动解决，也不提出解决的方案；而且提出的要求很高。因此，党组织必须对全体工作人员经常地进行教育，树立为国家工业建设服务的思想，批判各种错误思想和错误作风。党组织要教育建设单位和支援单位主动地相互支援，密切协作，开展批评和自我批评；有些问题，要互相体谅，而不是互相埋怨，使大家懂得加强团结是做好支援工作的关键。
    党组织还应该加强对支援工作的监督检查。今年五月，市委、市人民委员会联合召开了支援基本建设工作会议，在会上批判了支援不力的单位，表扬了支援工作作得好的单位，并且交流了经验，会后各部门的支援工作就有了若干改善。
    组织支援单位和建设单位的职工群众相互教育，鼓舞群众积极性，这也是一件很重要的政治工作。在这方面我们曾经采用了以下几种方式：一、组织参观慰问，这样既可以鼓舞基建工人完成建设任务的信心，又使支援单位的工作人员认识支援工作的重要性，保证努力完成支援任务。二、组织基本建设工地和生产工人互相提出保证开展竞赛，以便互相鼓舞督促。三、组织建设单位和支援单位通信，特别在工程任务紧张、工作困难时，组织后方工人写信鼓舞前方基建工人，基建工人也经常写信向后方报告工作提出要求。这样就可以互相推动，共同前进。
    加强支援工作的计划性和组织领导，扭转被动局面
    过去两年（一九五三年和一九五四年），武汉地区的工业建设，一般还处于准备阶段，牵涉范围不大。今年，各建设单位陆续进入施工阶段，因而支援任务逐渐繁重起来。在开始时，一方面建设单位拿不出计划，现要现抓；或者计划提得过大、过远，不切实际；而武汉市有关的支援单位在思想上、组织上、具体措施上又都缺少准备，因此支援工作显得很被动。有的工地已经要征收土地，而搬迁农民的方案我们还没有拟好；有的工地的工人已经集中，但是粮食、油、盐、日用品的供应还都成问题。建设单位派了大批人员成天到处交涉，支援各部门也感到头绪太多，变化太大，难于应付。经过几次研究，并进行了以下几项工作，才逐步扭转了被动混乱局面。
    今春，市委召集城市有关单位开了动员会，并组织三十一个有关单位，分别到各建设单位，特别是重点建设单位进行调查访问。经过这次调查，不但使支援单位了解了情况，具体地感到支援任务重大因而开始重视支援工作，而且通过调查，双方还建立了联系。城市各支援单位同各建设单位进行了反复协商，制定了支援、服务的计划，市人民委员会再把各单位计划进行审查，综合平衡，使支援工作得以比较有计划地进行。
    武汉市的基本建设单位是很多的，首先要注意抓住几个主要单位的问题加以研究解决。支援工作也是多方面的，但其中以城市规划、城市建设、建筑材料、交通运输、劳动力调配和商品供应等工作最为重要。因此，我们首先注意研究解决这些方面的问题。
    各建设单位问题很多，除了许多特殊问题自己不能解决的以外，城市各支援部门都应该分别包干，直接同建设单位建立联系，负责解决问题。实际上只要各支援单位认真管起来，加强对各建设单位的业务指导，许多问题都是可以解决的。如青山工地一直喊医务人员缺乏，市卫生局负责管起工地的卫生工作后，把各单位现有的人力计算一下，统一组织起来，结果只要补助些药品就可以解决问题，而且力量还有富余。
    过去许多建设单位，没有专人负责管理这一工作，临时发生问题，临时派人乱抓。支援单位虽然热情很高，但是，也没有专人掌握这一工作，因此许多支援工作就被日常业务挤掉了。现在各建设单位都确定一位负责同志统一掌握这一工作，各支援单位除由负责人之一亲自掌握外，并建立专门机构，专管支援业务。目前全市已有四十六个支援单位十一个建设单位建立了专管机构。有关全市的支援协作由市人民委员会基本建设办公室统一负责，这样，支援工作就逐渐有了头绪。
    今春以来，加强了这几项工作以后，逐渐扭转了支援工作的被动局面。各支援单位开始重视支援工作，把支援计划列入自己的工作计划；建设单位也积极和支援单位协作。这样一来，许多问题就容易解决了。如武汉长江大桥汉阳工地变动变压线的问题，原来武汉冶电业局强调困难，交涉两个月没有解决。后来工地派出技术人员和电业局共同研究，并负责解决材料问题，结果三个工人一天时间就把问题解决了。但是，由于我们对基本建设单位的情况掌握还不准确，缺少这方面的经验，基本建设工程情况变化很大，头绪很多，完全扭转被动局面，还待进一步努力。
    支援基本建设，必须挖掘内部潜力
    支援国家工业建设，保证工业建设胜利完成，这事情本身，就给全市党组织和全市人民以很大鼓舞，就是推进全市各项工作的动力。而且，各部门承担了支援基本建设任务后，任务加大，工作质量要求很高，时间要求也很紧迫，不改进工作，挖掘内部潜力，就无法完成支援任务。开始时，许多部门认为，既然增加任务，就要扩大编制，增加设备。这想法是不现实的。应该说我们的潜力是很大的，应该发挥现有的潜在力量来支援工业建设。各单位根据这个精神深入摸底计算，动员群众设法改进工作，结果证明，只要认真挖掘潜在力量，就能够很好地完成支援任务。例如武汉长江大桥工地要求武汉船舶修理厂承制三艘趸船和五艘铁驳。开始船舶修理厂不敢接受这些任务。的确，按照该厂过去只能修修补补的技术设备能力来说，担负这一任务是有困难的。但由于他们专门组织了检查组深入摸底，挖掘潜力，轮渡公司又抽调一位工程师前往该厂支援，船舶修理厂终于接受了这一任务，及时完成了全部船体设计和附属设备设计，并开始进行有关生产的准备工作。交通运输部门加强了管理工作的计划性，发动群众提高了汽车运输效率和船只利用率，就保证完成了基本建设特别是重点建设工程的运输任务。
