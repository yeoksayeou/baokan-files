Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 1st. The broad masses of Chongqing citizens are actively assisting the government in conserving and managing grain. Residents in over 400 residential sections in the central district of the city have begun supervising private grain retailers. Residents' committee members and street activists frequently offer opinions and criticisms regarding private grain stores' shortages in weight, lack of attention to grain cleanliness, and poor attitude towards customers. After residents in areas like Shihui City, Baixiang Street, and Chaotianmen reported shortages in weight at Zhongxing, Fengnian, and Shunji rice mills and stores, the city's grain department quickly conducted inspections and took action. Deng Nanyu, a resident of Qiansimen, reported the speculative behavior of private food vendor Zhang Ziheng, who was using grain purchase certificates to illegally purchase grain. The city's grain department immediately stopped this practice according to the law. Residents near Wangye Temple discovered private merchants and a few farmers bringing grain into the city were engaging in off-site transactions and immediately notified the grain department to stop this illegal activity.

Since the launch of the mass grain conservation movement in late July, residents' committees, public security committees, and women's mass organizations in various streets throughout the city have made promoting grain conservation one of their current central tasks. Many residents' committee members, women's committee members, and mass activists have gone deep into residential sections to conduct propaganda. They promptly offer opinions and criticisms regarding wasteful grain consumption behaviors in nearby organizations and among residents. Liu Suqing and Bao Chunfang, the directors of the 7th and 8th residents' committees in Shangqingsi, used their own exemplary actions to encourage several hundred households to make grain conservation plans. After receiving grain conservation education, many residents automatically reduced their grain purchase amounts.

The Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce also organized capitalists and workers in private grain-using industries to study grain conservation. Workers at the jointly owned State-Private 610 Textile Factory and the jointly owned State-Private Daming Textile Dyeing Factory adopted lime slurry sizing, saving a large amount of grain.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 3rd. Over 800 collective mess halls in Jinan are strictly reviewing grain consumption plans and improving mess hall management. Grain consumption in July decreased by 14.5% compared to May.

In July, all collective mess halls in Jinan formulated grain consumption plans, established a registration system for meals for visiting guests, family members, and staff working away from home, and implemented other management systems. Many units' grain consumption plans were first formulated by individuals, then reviewed by groups and approved by administrative authorities. In the past, the Shandong Provincial Department of Transportation canteen had many people taking away large quantities of steamed buns every Saturday. Since strengthening canteen management, the canteen has been able to reduce flour usage by about 50 jin every Saturday.

    济南八百多个集体伙食单位严格节约粮食
    新华社重庆一日电　重庆市广大市民积极协助政府做好粮食节约和粮食管理工作。市中心区四百多个居民段居民对私营代销粮店已实行监督。居民委员、街道积极分子等对私营粮店短少斤两、不注意粮食清洁和对顾客态度不好等时常提出意见和批评。石灰市、白象街、朝天门等地居民揭发中兴、丰年、顺记米厂、米店短少斤两后，市粮食部门很快作了检查和处理。千厮门居民邓南玉检举了私营饮食商张子恒借用购粮证套购粮食的投机行为，市粮食部门立刻依法制止。王爷庙附近的居民发现私商和少数带粮食进城的农民作场外交易，马上通知粮食部门制止这种违法行为。
    自七月下旬，全市开展群众性的节约粮食运动后，各街道居民委员会、治安保卫委员会和街道妇女的群众组织都把宣传节约粮食作为当前的中心工作之一。许多居民委员、妇女委员和群众积极分子深入到居民段进行宣传。他们对附近机关和居民中浪费粮食的行为都及时提出意见，给予批评。上清寺第七、第八居民段居民委员会主任委员刘素卿、鲍春舫用自己的模范行动，带动三百几十户居民订了节约粮食的计划。许多居民群众在受到节约粮食教育后，自动减少了购粮数目。
    市工商业联合会还组织私营用粮行业中的资方人员和职工进行节约粮食的学习。公私合营六一零纺织厂和公私合营大明纺织染厂的职工采用石灰浆纱，节约了大批粮食。
    新华社济南三日讯　济南市八百多个集体伙食单位严格审核用粮计划，改进食堂管理，七月份粮食消费量比五月份降低百分之十四点五。
    七月份，济南市所有集体伙食单位都制定了用粮计划，建立了来往客人、家属和外出工作人员用饭登记制和其他一些管理制度。许多单位的用粮计划是先由个人制定，再经过小组评议和行政审查批准的。山东省交通厅食堂过去每到星期六就要被许多人带走大批馒头，自从加强食堂管理后，每星期六可减少用面五十斤左右。
