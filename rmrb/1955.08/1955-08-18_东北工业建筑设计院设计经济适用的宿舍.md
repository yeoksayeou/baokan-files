The Northeast Industrial Building Design Institute has designed several economical and practical standard dormitories based on the new building cost standards.

These standard dormitories are designed according to the climatic conditions and living habits of residents in Northeast China. The climate in Northeast China is relatively cold, and the climate in the south and north is also different. In the past, the design of houses in the Shenyang area was based on a minimum temperature of minus 25 degrees Celsius, and the walls were two bricks thick. In reality, the temperature in this area does not drop to minus 25 degrees Celsius for very long, so the designers, when designing the standard dormitories for this area, used minus 21 degrees Celsius as the standard and changed the walls to one and a half bricks thick. Similarly, the thickness of the walls of dormitories in the northern region was also appropriately reduced. Because there is heating equipment indoors, the insulation requirements can still be met. They also designed heating equipment such as "kang" (heated platforms) or heated walls for some dormitories based on the living habits of the masses.

These standard dormitories fully utilize local materials in their design. For example, using sorghum stalks, which are burned as firewood in rural areas, as ceilings, roof boards, and partitions is much cheaper than using wood boards. After testing, it has been proven that ceilings made of sorghum stalks are also very strong and equally beautiful after being plastered.

These standard dormitories are also divided into three types: low-standard bungalows, medium-standard bungalows, and multi-story dormitories, totaling eight types. The cost per square meter of low-standard bungalows is 18 to 21 yuan, and they can be inhabited for 15 to 20 years. The cost per square meter of medium-standard bungalows is 26 to 34 yuan, and they can be inhabited for 20 to 40 years. The cost per square meter of three-story dormitories is 43 to 47 yuan, with complete indoor plumbing, heating, and electricity, and they can be inhabited for 40 to 60 years.

Before designing these standard dormitories, engineers and technicians from the design institute went to the countryside six times to investigate and study the output, origin, performance, specifications, and prices of 29 kinds of local materials. They also learned about the construction forms of folk buildings and the living habits of residents as references for the design. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 东北工业建筑设计院设计经济适用的宿舍

    东北工业建筑设计院设计经济适用的宿舍
    东北工业建筑设计院根据新的建筑造价标准，设计出几种经济适用的标准宿舍。
    这批标准宿舍是根据东北地区的气候条件和居民生活习惯设计的。东北地区气候较冷，南部北部气候也有所不同。过去设计沈阳地区的房屋，以最低温度零下二十五度为标准，墙都是两块砖的厚度。实际在这个地区，温度下降到零下二十五度的时间并不多，因此设计人员在设计这个地区的标准宿舍时，就以零下二十一度为准，将墙改为一块半砖的厚度；同样，将北部地区宿舍墙的厚度，也适当减小。由于室内都有取暖设备，仍然能达到保温的要求。他们还根据群众的生活习惯，为部分宿舍设计了火炕或火墙等取暖设备。
    这批标准宿舍在设计中都充分利用了地方材料。比如采用在农村中当柴烧的秫秸作天棚、望板、间壁等，比木板要便宜得多；经过试验，证明秫秸作的天棚也很结实，刷上灰浆后也同样美观。
    这批标准宿舍还分低标准平房、中标准平房和楼房宿舍三种，共八个类型。低标准平房每平方公尺的造价是十八元到二十一元，可以居住十五年到二十年。中标准平房每平方公尺的造价是二十六元到三十四元，可居住二十年到四十年。三层楼房宿舍每平方公尺的造价是四十三元到四十七元，室内水暖电灯都齐全，可居住四十年到六十年。
    在设计这批标准宿舍前，这个设计院的工程师、技术人员等，曾先后六次到农村去，对二十九种地方材料的产量、产地、性能、规格、价格等进行调查研究，并了解民间建筑的构造形式和居民生活习惯等，作为设计的参考。（新华社）
