If Tigers are Not Eradicated, Tigers Will Eat People

—A Record of the Northwest Agricultural College Uncovering Two Cases of Counter-Revolutionary Elements Committing Assaults

Wang Feng, Lü Hua

At 12:20 PM on July 16th, Ma Zongshen, a lecturer in the Marxist-Leninist teaching and research group at Northwest Agricultural College, had just finished lunch in the cafeteria and was preparing to return to his dormitory to rest. As he was walking halfway there, Li Hongbin, a hidden counter-revolutionary element, secretly followed him, holding a piece of firebrick five inches long, four inches wide, and two inches thick. When he got within about a step of Ma Zongshen, he suddenly smashed the brick against the back of Ma Zongshen's head. Ma Zongshen was knocked down, lost consciousness, and blood flowed from his nose and mouth. Then, this counter-revolutionary element pressed down on Ma Zongshen's body, tightly掐住 Ma Zongshen's neck with his hand, and took out a four-inch-long pair of scissors from his pocket, attempting to stab Ma Zongshen to death. Fortunately, students Yan Xijing and staff members Lu Qihe and Zhang Enrong discovered this and rushed over, capturing the assaulting counter-revolutionary element and forcefully seizing the scissors from his hand. At the same time, they rescued and treated Ma Zongshen. At this time, this assaulting counter-revolutionary element, Li Hongbin, stubbornly resisted and arrogantly said: "I have a feud with Ma Zongshen and want to stab him to death!"

This assaulting counter-revolutionary element, Li Hongbin, came from a large landlord family. He was a core member of the Kuomintang. Before liberation, he consistently held important positions in the Chiang Kai-shek government organs and had also been trained at the pseudo-Chongqing "Central Political School Civil Servant Training Class." Later, he served as the director of the personnel office of the pseudo-Chongqing National Taxation Bureau, engaging in many anti-people crimes. After liberation, he concealed his history and infiltrated Northwest Agricultural College, stealing the position of manager of the consumer cooperative. During this period, he colluded with a fugitive landlord with many heinous crimes to continue carrying out counter-revolutionary activities. At the same time, he took advantage of his position to embezzle and squander public property, embezzling and stealing more than 1,000 yuan of people's property. During the "Three-Anti" movement in 1952, not only did he not confess, but he also cunningly altered and destroyed accounts and used despicable means such as attempting suicide by jumping into a well (unsuccessfully) to sabotage the "Three-Anti" movement. Later, he was sentenced to two years by the People's Court and underwent labor reform. After completing his sentence, he pretended to be "sincerely repentant" and returned to Northwest Agricultural College. At that time, due to the imperfect personnel system of Northwest Agricultural College and the lack of strict scrutiny in absorbing personnel, he was again allowed to sneak into the college's printing factory as a temporary typesetter. After this counter-revolutionary element sneaked into Northwest Agricultural College this time, he adopted the two-faced tactics commonly used by Hu Feng elements. On the surface, he repeatedly said: "I believe in the Party. The Party is my strict father and loving mother, turning me, a prodigal son, around. I will follow the Party forever." He also pretended to be law-abiding and worked diligently. But in reality, he harbored extreme hatred for the Party and the people and continued to carry out counter-revolutionary conspiracies. He used every method to sow discord and undermine the relationship between leaders and the masses. In front of Wang Mingxun, the director of the printing factory, he flattered him in every way, saying how wise and capable the director was and how much he cared for the cadres. But behind his back, he told the workers: "Director Wang is vicious and cunning, oppressing and mistreating the workers." He also frequently spread reactionary remarks. The leaders and employees of Northwest Agricultural College lost their due vigilance against this hidden counter-revolutionary element, and were blinded by his superficial activeness. Not only did they fail to detect his counter-revolutionary activities in time, but they also believed that he had made great "progress" after labor reform during the "Three-Anti" movement. Four months after he began "working," they promoted him from a temporary typesetter to a probationary staff member. Recently, in the struggle to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements, the teachers, students, and staff of the agricultural college, after studying, had their eyes opened. This heinous counter-revolutionary element, seeing that his series of crimes was about to be exposed, was both terrified and hateful. Thus, he made a desperate struggle, frantically carrying out counter-revolutionary assassination activities, attempting to murder lecturer Ma Zongshen, who had resolutely fought against him during the "Three-Anti" movement.

The other assaulting counter-revolutionary element was named Wang Shirong. His family was also a large landlord. He himself was a core member of the Three People's Principles Youth League. In 1948, he worked in the military law office of the pseudo-Xi'an Pacification Headquarters. In 1951, he infiltrated Northwest Agricultural College to study in the Plant Protection Department. He always adhered to a reactionary stance, hated the people's regime, and engaged in counter-revolutionary activities. He frequently spread rumors, attacked Communist Youth League members, sowed discord, and undermined the unity of the students. In front of ordinary students, he spread rumors, saying: "All Communist Youth League members have a bad style and specialize in oppressing students." When some students refuted him, he would say: "That's because you don't understand the situation." Usually, he acted furtively. Sometimes, when the students were in class, he would sneak out of the school alone to carry out conspiracies. Sometimes, when the students collectively participated in recreational activities, he would hide in the dormitory to write secret letters. When teachers and students criticized his behavior, he retorted: "You are too dictatorial, restricting people's freedom." He tried every means to undermine the students' studies. This spring, during the production practice of the graduating class, when the students were participating in the cotton seed selection work, everyone carefully selected the healthiest and best cotton seeds for preservation, but he deliberately put bad cotton seeds into the bags of good cotton seeds. When checking the latent state of wireworms in the soil, he deliberately mistook earthworms for insects, making the inspection and research work inaccurate. He showed deep-seated hatred for the people's regime. At a study and discussion meeting, when the students discussed class struggle, he distorted the facts and said: "There is no class struggle. My family has been landlords for eight generations and has never exploited anyone. We built our wealth through hard work!" He nakedly exposed his class nature. During an internship visiting an agricultural production cooperative, the students were all delighted that the farmers were organized to take the road to happiness for everyone, but he showed deep-seated hatred. He also slandered the new China, saying: "This society is dictatorial and dark. Eighty percent of the people have no freedom." For such a resolute counter-revolutionary element, the teachers and students of the agricultural college lacked vigilance. They naively believed that "this is a problem of ideology and should be slowly educated in a comradely manner." Therefore, he became even more rampant in carrying out destructive activities.

After the campaign to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements was launched this time, this counter-revolutionary element began to passively resist, not studying documents or speaking out. When the students, after studying, reported his counter-revolutionary activities, he openly disrupted the meeting, claiming to "kick out" the students hosting the meeting and calling the meeting a "gangster meeting," making it impossible to proceed. On July 17th, the study group leader, according to the instructions of the Education Committee of the Agricultural College, asked him to write a written review of his consistent reactionary words and deeds. He cursed loudly, saying: "Who dares to ask me to write a review!" He ran to the Education Committee office to make a scene. The staff in the office told him: "This is the instruction of the leaders." He immediately tried to break into the president's office to commit assault. The staff in the office stepped forward to stop him, and he punched the office staff Zhang Hongzhi and others. Fortunately, there were many people on the scene, and his plot failed. The school staff immediately reported the local public security organs, and he was arrested.

Who can not be deeply angered by such two die-hard counter-revolutionary elements who retaliate with violence? The students, teachers, and staff of Northwest Agricultural College have recently held a series of forums, exposing and denouncing the crimes of these two counter-revolutionary elements, unanimously demanding that the people's government severely punish them according to law, and expressing their determination to resolutely overcome complacency in practical actions, raise their vigilance, and thoroughly eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements. Wei Jiangchun, a fourth-year student in the Plant Protection Department, said: "We were too complacent in the past. We slept with a tiger for four whole years. The counter-revolutionary element Wang Shirong undermined us every day, and we treated it as a problem of ideology and educated him. Thinking about it now, it's really too naive." Wang Mingxun, the director of the printing factory, said: "The counter-revolutionary element Li Hongbin used exactly the same methods as the Hu Feng elements. On the surface, he was amiable and flattered us, but in reality, he was smiling with a dagger hidden in his smile, the most insidious and vicious." After these two incidents of counter-revolutionary elements committing assault, everyone's eyes were further opened, and they gradually realized that: It is not enough to just talk about vigilance today. We must truly become vigilant ideologically and fight against all hidden counter-revolutionary elements.

Lecturer Ma Zongshen, who was attacked by the counter-revolutionary element, has recovered his health after treatment. During his recuperation, the responsible comrades of Northwest Agricultural College and many teachers, students, and staff members went to visit him with concern. When we visited him, he said: "This incident further aroused my hatred for all counter-revolutionary elements. I will study the materials on the Hu Feng incident even better in the future, especially raise my vigilance, and continue to participate in the struggle to eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements!"

    不肃清老虎，老虎就要吃人
    ——记西北农学院破获两个反革命分子行凶案件的经过
    王枫　吕化
    七月十六日中午十二时二十分，西北农学院马克思列宁主义教研组讲师马宗申，刚由食堂吃罢午饭，准备回到宿舍去休息。正走到半路的时候，一个暗藏的反革命分子李鸿滨手拿一块五寸长四寸宽二寸厚的耐火砖，暗自跟随在后面，他走近距离马宗申约一步远的地方，猛的将砖头向马宗申头部后脑门砸去，当时马宗申被砸倒，晕了过去，鼻口流血；接着，这个反革命分子又压在马宗申的身上，一面用手紧紧掐住马宗申的脖子，一面从怀中取出四寸长的剪刀一把，企图把马宗申刺死。这时，幸被学生阎西京和职工陆其和、张恩荣等发现，他们赶来，把行凶的反革命分子捉住，并奋力夺下他手中的剪刀；同时把马宗申救起医治。这时候，这个行凶的反革命分子李鸿滨，还蛮横地顽抗，并狂妄地说：“我同马宗申有仇，要把他刺死！”
    这个行凶的反革命分子李鸿滨，家庭是个大地主。他是国民党的骨干分子，解放前一贯在蒋贼政府机关担任重要职务，还在重庆伪“中央政治学校公务员训练班”受过训，以后又任伪重庆国税局人事室主任，干了许多反人民的罪恶活动。解放后，他隐瞒了历史潜入西北农学院，并窃取了消费合作社经理的职务。在此期间，他曾和一个罪恶多端的逃亡地主互相勾结，继续进行反革命活动。同时，他又利用职权，大肆贪污挥霍，先后贪污盗窃了人民财产一千多元。一九五二年“三反”运动中，他不但不坦白，反而狡猾地涂改和烧毁账目，并用跳井自杀（未死）等卑鄙手段，破坏“三反”运动。后经人民法院判刑两年，进行劳动改造。刑满释放后，他又装出“真诚悔过”的样子，回到西北农学院。当时由于西北农学院人事制度不健全，吸收人员缺乏严格的审查，又使他混进了该院印刷厂做临时刻写工作。这个反革命分子这次混进西北农学院后，采用了胡风分子惯用的两面手法，表面上口口声声说：“我相信党，党是我的严父慈母，使我这个浪子回了头，我要永远跟着党走。”在工作中也装得奉公守法，积极努力；但实际上对党对人民极端仇恨，继续进行反革命的阴谋活动。他利用一切方法挑拨离间，破坏领导和群众的关系。在印刷厂厂长王明勋面前，他百般恭维，说厂长如何英明能干，关心干部；背后却对职工们说：“王厂长毒辣狡猾，欺压苛待职工。”并经常散布反动言论。西北农学院的领导上和职工们，对这个暗藏的反革命分子丧失了应有的警惕，受了他表面积极的蒙蔽，不仅没有及时识破他的反革命活动，反而认为他在“三反”后经过劳动改造，大有“进步”，在他“工作”四个月后，又把他由临时刻写人员提升为试用人员。最近在肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子的斗争中，农学院的师生员工们经过学习，擦亮了眼睛。这个罪大恶极的反革命分子眼看他一系列的罪恶活动就要被揭露，既恐惧又仇恨，于是就作垂死的挣扎，疯狂地进行反革命凶杀活动，谋刺在“三反”运动中曾坚决向他进行斗争的马宗申讲师。
    另一个行凶的反革命分子叫王世荣，家庭也是个大地主，他本人是三青团的骨干分子，一九四八年曾在西安伪绥靖公署军法处工作。一九五一年混入西北农学院植物保护系学习。他一直坚持反动立场，仇恨人民政权，进行反革命活动。他经常散布谣言，打击青年团员，挑拨离间，破坏同学们的团结。在一般同学面前，他造谣说：“凡是青年团员，作风都不好，专门欺压学生。”当有的同学反驳时，他又说：“这是你不了解情况。”平时他一贯行动鬼祟，有时当同学们正上课时，他一个人偷偷摸摸到校外去进行阴谋活动；有时同学们集体参加文娱活动，他躲在宿舍写秘密信。当教师和同学对他的行为提出批评时，他竟反噬说：“你们太专制，限制人的自由。”他更想尽一切方法破坏同学们的学习。今年春天，在毕业班同学生产实习中，同学们参加棉籽粒选工作时，大家都仔细地挑选最健全的好棉籽保存，而他却故意把坏棉籽放到装好棉籽的布袋里。当检查金针虫在土壤的潜伏状况时，他故意把蚯蚓当成昆虫，使检查研究工作失去了准确性。对于人民政权，他更表现了刻骨的仇恨。在一次学习讨论会上，同学们讨论到阶级斗争时，他竟颠倒黑白地说：“那有什么阶级斗争，我家八代都是地主，向来没有剥削过人，是刻苦成家的！”赤裸裸地暴露了他的阶级本性。在实习中参观农业生产合作社时，同学们都为农民组织起来走大家幸福的道路而欢欣鼓舞，他却表现了刻骨的仇恨。他还诬蔑新中国说：“这个社会是专制的、黑暗的，百分之八十的人都没自由。”对于这样一个坚决的反革命分子，农学院的教师和同学们却丧失了警惕，他们还天真地认为“这是思想问题，要慢慢进行同志式的教育。”因此，他就更加猖狂地进行破坏活动。
    这次展开肃清一切暗藏反革命分子的斗争后，这个反革命分子开始消极抗拒，不学习文件，也不发言；当同学们经过学习，检举了他的反革命活动时，他竟公开捣乱讨论会的会场，声言要把主持会的同学“踢出去”，并骂讨论会是“地痞流氓会”，使会议无法进行。七月十七日，学习组长根据农学院教育委员会的指示，要他对其一贯的反动言行写出书面检讨，他开口大骂说：“那个人敢叫我写检讨！”他跑到教育委员会办公室吵闹，办公室的工作人员告诉他：“这是领导同志指示的。”他马上又要闯进院长办公室企图行凶。办公室的工作人员上前拦阻，他就用拳头殴打办公室工作人员张鸿志等；幸当场人多，他的凶谋未逞。学校人员当即报告了当地公安机关，把他逮捕起来。
    对这样两个死心蹋地、行凶报复的反革命分子，谁能不万分愤恨呢？西北农学院的同学、教师和职工们，最近连续举行了座谈会，纷纷揭露和控诉这两个反革命分子的罪行，一致要求人民政府依法严惩，并表示要坚决在实际行动中克服麻痹思想，高度地警惕起来，彻底肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子。植物保护系四年级学生魏江春说：“过去我们太麻痹了，整整同老虎在一起睡了四年；反革命分子王世荣天天破坏我们，我们还当成思想问题进行教育，现在想起来真是太天真了。”印刷厂厂长王明勋说：“反革命分子李鸿滨和胡风分子用的完全是一样的手法，表面上和气，恭维我们，实际上是笑里藏刀，最阴险毒辣。”经过这两起反革命分子行凶事件，大家更擦亮了眼睛，逐渐认识到：今天光口头说警惕不行，要从思想上真正警惕起来，同一切暗藏的反革命分子作斗争。
    曾被反革命分子谋害的马宗申讲师，经过医治，现已恢复健康。在他休养期间，西北农学院的负责同志和许多师生职工等，都关心地去慰问他。当我们访问他的时候，他说：“这件事更能激起我对一切反革命分子的痛恨，我今后要更好地学习有关胡风事件的材料，特别提高警惕，继续参加肃清一切反革命分子的斗争！”
