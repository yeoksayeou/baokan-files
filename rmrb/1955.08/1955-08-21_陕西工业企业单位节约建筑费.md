　　Shaanxi Industrial Enterprises Save Construction Costs
    The eighteen capital construction units under the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Industry's local state-owned and joint state-private industrial enterprises, after repeated research and verification by the Department of Industry, can save more than 990,000 yuan in financial allocations in the second half of 1955, accounting for more than 11 percent of their original total annual financial allocations.
    Based on the principle of frugality, these eighteen capital construction units reduced construction projects that were optional, and lowered construction costs based on the principles of practicality, economy, and aesthetics within possible conditions. For example, the joint state-private Xinqin Company originally planned to build one East and one West family dormitory each, but now the East family dormitory has been completely cancelled, and the West family dormitory has been reduced from five buildings to four, saving a total of more than 156,000 yuan. The Tongchuan Ceramics Factory originally planned to add a bathroom in the expansion project, but has decided not to build it, and will appropriately reinforce the old bathroom and find ways to improve its utilization rate, which will save more than 5,200 yuan. This factory changed the center distance of the roof rafters from 20 cm to 25 cm on the premise of ensuring appropriate firmness, which saved one-fifth of the rafters; all false structures such as eaves boards on the houses were cancelled; and the plastering materials for the brick pillar adobe houses were changed to cheap wheat straw mud, etc. The Tongchuan Ceramics Factory saved more than 21,500 yuan by reducing construction costs.
    In the second half of the year, in Shaanxi Province's industrial capital construction, some decorative parts will be reduced as much as possible, and some expensive building materials will be replaced with cheaper alternatives as much as possible. For example, the joint building of the Shaanxi Provincial Surveying and Mapping Team and the Industrial Experiment Institute eliminated the small triangular roof and balcony, and the artificial stone on the outside of the wall was changed to a cement yellow sand surface, and the glossy terrazzo floor was changed to a simple cement floor. The brick flower wall of the Shaanxi Provincial Industrial School was also partially changed to cheap and practical rammed earth walls and wire mesh, which greatly reduced the construction cost.　(Li Hongru)

　　陕西工业企业单位节约建筑费
    陕西省工业厅所属地方国营和公私合营工业中正在施工和即将施工的十八个基本建设单位，经过反复研究，并经工业厅核定在一九五五年下半年可节约财务拨款九十九万多元，占其原定全年财务拨款总数的百分之十一以上。
    这十八个基本建设单位，根据节约原则，把可办可不办的工程项目削减，并本着适用、经济和可能条件下的美观的原则，降低造价。如公私合营新秦公司原定修建东、西家属宿舍各一处，现在把东家属宿舍全部撤销，西家属宿舍由五幢房屋减为四幢，共计可节约十五万六千多元。铜川陶瓷厂在扩建工程中原定增修浴室一个，已决定不修，而把旧浴室适当加固并设法提高其使用率，这就可以节约五千二百多元。这个厂在保证有适当坚固程度的前提下，把屋顶木椽的中距由二十公分改为二十五公分，这就节约了五分之一的木椽；房屋上的封檐板等虚假结构一律取消；砖柱土坯房屋的粉刷用料，改用廉价的麦草泥等。铜川陶瓷厂因为降低造价共节约了二万一千五百多元。
    陕西省在下半年的工业基本建设中，一些装饰部分，将尽可能地加以减少，一些高贵的建筑材料也将尽量用廉价的代替。如陕西省勘测队和工业试验所合用的楼房，剔除了小三角屋顶和阳台，墙外的斩假石改成了水泥黄沙粉面，光亮的水磨石地坪改成了朴素的水泥地坪。陕西省工业学校的砖花围墙也被分段改用便宜而适用的土打墙和铁丝网，这就大大地降低了工程造价。　（李红如）
