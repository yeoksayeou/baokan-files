Xinhua News Agency, London dispatch via TASS: The international scientists' conference on atomic energy issues, held in London, closed on the 5th. At the closing meeting, the representatives listened to and discussed the reports of the various committees of the conference.

    Australian Professor Oliphant, when reporting on the work of the committee, emphasized that the active participation of Soviet scientists in the committee's work was "the most remarkable and encouraging feature of the conference." He said: "The incorrect practice of previously using science for destructive purposes can now give way to cooperation for the well-being of all."

    The conference unanimously adopted the recommendations put forward by the committee, with the addition of supplementary opinions from the Soviet representatives, and determined the future tasks of the work to be: studying the destructive potential of nuclear weapons; studying the possible consequences of the large-scale use of such weapons in war and the consequences of testing such weapons, as well as the harmful consequences that may occur when atomic energy is used for peaceful purposes; studying the issue of methods of protection against atomic radiation for personnel engaged in research work on the peaceful use of atomic energy. The recommendation also expressed the hope that future work of scientists will be devoted to preventing the use of atomic energy for military purposes.

    The conference also adopted another committee's recommendation on "studying the technical problems of supervising and regulating the production and use of nuclear weapons to ensure the prohibition of such weapons."

    Finally, the conference discussed and adopted a general resolution proposed by the British scientist Russell. The general resolution stated that since the use of nuclear weapons would subject mankind to incalculable disasters, the participants in the conference called on the governments of all countries to "recognize and publicly acknowledge that a world war cannot help them achieve their goals." The general resolution called for "thorough and open research into the consequences of recent scientific inventions for all mankind" and "the peaceful resolution of all international disputes."

    讨论原子能问题的国际科学家会议闭幕
    新华社六日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：在伦敦举行的讨论原子能问题的国际科学家会议在五日闭幕。在闭幕会议上，代表们听取了并且讨论了会议各个委员会的报告。
    澳大利亚的奥利法特教授在报告委员会的工作时着重指出：苏联科学家积极参加委员会工作，这是“会议最显著的和令人鼓舞的特征”。他说：“以前彼此利用科学达到破坏目的的不正确做法，已经可以让位给为大家谋幸福的合作了。”
    会议一致通过了委员会提出的并加进了苏联代表的补充意见的建议，确定今后的工作任务是：研究核子武器的破坏潜力；研究在战争中大规模采用这种武器可能造成的后果和试验这种武器的后果以及在原子能用于和平目的时可能发生的有害后果；研究关于从事和平利用原子能的研究工作的人员防御原子辐射的方法的问题。这项建议并且表示希望今后科学家的工作将致力于防止把原子能用于军事目的。
    会议还通过了另一个委员会关于“研究监督和管制核子武器的生产和使用的技术问题，以保证禁止这种武器”的建议。
    会议最后讨论和通过了英国科学家罗素提出的总决议。总决议说，由于使用核子武器将使人类遭到无可估量的灾难，参加会议的人呼吁世界各国政府“认识到并且公开承认：世界大战并不能帮助他们实现他们的目的”。总决议要求“彻底和公开地研究最近的科学发明对全人类的后果”，以及“以和平方式解决一切国际争端”。
