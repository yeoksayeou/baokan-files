Capitalist Countries Plunged into Economic Crisis

　　U.S. Public Debt Burden Worries American Economic Circles

    New York dispatch: The rapidly increasing debt of the American people has placed a heavy burden on the entire American economy. The August 5th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" wrote, "The American people owe more money than ever before, and are sinking deeper into debt month by month." According to the magazine's statistics, by the middle of this year, the private debt in the United States reached 352.3 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of two and a half times compared to ten years ago. In the past year, the new debt increased by 14 billion U.S. dollars. In the first half of this year, the new debt increased by 10.4 billion U.S. dollars. Among these private debts, the consumer debt, the vast majority of which is the debt of the working people with meager incomes, has increased even faster, quadrupling in the past decade to reach 109.6 billion U.S. dollars. Farmers' debts have increased two and a half times in the last decade, reaching 18.4 billion U.S. dollars, which is 1.6 times the farmers' annual net income.

    This situation has caused serious concern in American economic circles. Since a considerable part of the current U.S. consumer goods market is supported by installment purchases, the huge debt will make it increasingly difficult for consumers to bear, and future purchasing power will be damaged. Many economists worry that this increase in debt contains "dangerous signs" that "include the seeds of future depression."

    The U.S. government has recently had to take some measures to tighten credit and limit debt. However, these measures have seriously affected many enterprises that rely on credit loans and installment sales of products. American magazines believe that due to the tightening of credit, housing construction and steel production will decline.

　　U.S. Massive Military Spending is the Pillar of Maintaining Enterprises

    New York dispatch: The August 12th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine wrote that despite negotiations for peace, U.S. military spending continues to maintain more than 40 billion U.S. dollars per year. In the 1956 fiscal year, which began on July 1 this year, appropriations for the manufacture of atomic weapons, the construction of military bases, etc., are even more than in the previous fiscal year. The magazine said: "Defense spending is still a major pillar of enterprises."

　　British Gold and Dollar Reserves Decline Sharply in July

    London dispatch: The British Treasury recently announced that Britain's gold and dollar reserves fell by another 136 million U.S. dollars in July. This drop in gold and dollar reserves is the most severe since February 1952.

    As of July 31, Britain's gold and dollar reserves were only 2.544 billion U.S. dollars, compared with 3.013 billion U.S. dollars on July 31 last year.

    At the same time, the British Treasury announced that Britain owed the European Payments Union another 25 million pounds in July, half of which must be repaid in gold or U.S. dollars in August (one pound equals 2.8 U.S. dollars).

    Reuters pointed out: The reduction of gold and dollar reserves is one of the signs of Britain's economic difficulties.

　　Severe Economic Crisis in Chile Causes Government Instability

    Santiago dispatch: The Chilean government has recently experienced another cabinet crisis. On August 12, all members of the Chilean cabinet submitted their resignations to President Ibáñez. Ibáñez accepted the resignation of the Minister of Economy and Commerce, Zúñiga, and appointed Herrera (former Minister of Education) as the new Minister of Economy and Commerce. Ibáñez rejected the resignations of other cabinet members but made some internal adjustments to the positions of cabinet members.

    The reason for the instability of the Chilean government is the increasingly serious economic crisis in Chile. Due to the rule of U.S. monopoly capital in Chile, Chile's financial and economic situation is becoming more and more difficult. This is particularly evident in Chile's domestic inflation and soaring prices. In the first half of this year, the cost of living in Chile rose by 35 percent compared to the end of 1954, and the exchange rate of the Chilean peso against the U.S. dollar dropped from 90 to 1 five years ago to 700 to 1. This situation has aroused widespread dissatisfaction among the Chilean people with the government. On July 8, a nationwide strike of 1.2 million workers, unprecedented in history, was held to protest the economic and financial policies adopted by the government and to demand that the government take measures to curb inflation and improve the domestic economic situation.

　　The Philippines' Balance of Payments Deteriorates

    Manila dispatch: The Philippine Association, composed of American and Filipino business people, recently released a report on the Philippine economic situation in the first half of 1955, stating that the Philippine economy is in a dangerous situation, with foreign exchange reserves falling to the lowest level since 1949, and the trade deficit is also the largest in five years.

    The report said that foreign exchange reserves at the end of June this year decreased by 24.66 million U.S. dollars compared with the end of last year, and decreased by 57.67 million U.S. dollars compared with the beginning of the decline in September last year.

    The report also said that in terms of foreign trade, imports in the first four months of this year increased by 26.4 million U.S. dollars compared with the same period last year, but exports in the first four months of this year decreased by 13.7 million U.S. dollars compared with the same period last year.

　　陷入经济危机的资本主义国家
　  美国人民负债沉重引起美国经济界忧虑
    纽约消息：美国人民迅速增加的负债，已经对美国整个经济发生沉重的压力。八月五日“美国新闻与世界报道”写道，“美国人民比以前任何时候都欠了更多的钱，而且一月比一月更深地陷入债务之中”。据这个杂志的统计，到今年年中，美国的私人债务达到三千五百二十三亿美元。比十年前增加了两倍半。在去年一年内，新债增加了一百四十亿美元。在今年上半年内，新债增加了一百零四亿美元。这些私人债务中，消费者的债务，其中绝大部分就是广大收入微薄的劳动人民的债务，增加得更快，十年来增加了四倍，达到一千零九十六亿美元。农民的债务十年来增加了两倍半，达到一百八十四亿美元，这个数目为农民一年净收入的一点六倍。
    这种情况已引起美国经济界的严重忧虑。由于目前美国消费品市场相当一部分是靠赊购的办法支撑的，而巨额的债务势将越来越使消费者难于负担，使未来的购买力受到破坏。许多经济学家担心，这种债务增加的“危险迹象”中“包括着未来萧条的种子”。
    美国政府最近也不得不采取了一些紧缩信贷、限制欠债的措施。而这种措施又使靠信用贷款和赊购销售产品的许多企业受到严重影响。美国杂志认为，由于缩紧信贷，房屋建筑、钢铁生产等都要下降。
    美国庞大的军费开支是维持企业的支柱
    纽约消息：八月十二日出版的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志写道，尽管在谈判和平，但是美国的军费开支继续保持每年四百亿美元以上。在从今年七月一日开始的一九五六财政年度里，在制造原子武器、建筑军事基地等方面的拨款还比上一财政年度要多。这家杂志说：“防务支出，仍旧是企业的一个主要支柱。”
    英国黄金美元储备七月份减少很多
    伦敦消息：英国财政部最近宣布：英国的黄金美元储备在七月份又减少了一亿三千六百万美元。这次黄金美元储备的下跌，是一九五二年二月以来最厉害的一次。
    到七月三十一日为止，英国的黄金美元储备只有二十五亿四千四百万美元，而去年七月三十一日有三十亿一千三百万美元。
    同时，英国财政部宣布：英国在七月份又亏欠了欧洲支付同盟二千五百万英镑，其中一半要在八月间用黄金或美元偿付（一英镑合美元二元八角）。
    路透社指出：黄金美元储备的减少是英国经济困难的征象之一。
    智利经济危机严重引起政府不稳
    圣地亚哥消息：智利政府最近又发生内阁危机。八月十二日，智利内阁全体人员向总统伊巴涅斯提出辞职。伊巴涅斯接受了经济及商务部长苏尼加的辞呈，并且委任埃雷拉（前教育部长）为新的经济及商务部长。其他阁员的辞职为伊巴涅斯所拒绝，但在阁员的职位上作了一些内部调动。
    智利政府不稳的原因是智利的经济危机日益严重。由于美国垄断资本在智利的统治，智利的财政和经济状况正在一天比一天困难。这一点特别表现在智利国内通货膨胀和物价飞涨上。在今年上半年，智利的生活费用比一九五四年年底上涨了百分之三十五，智利货币比索对美元的比值从五年前的九十比一降到七百比一。这种情况引起了智利广大人民对政府的不满。七月八日，全国举行过历史上空前的一百二十万职工大罢工，抗议政府所采取的经济和财政政策，并且要求政府采取措施制止通货膨胀，改善国内经济情况。
    菲律宾对外收支情况恶化
    马尼拉消息：由美国和菲律宾工商界人士组成的菲律宾协会最近发表一项关于一九五五年上半年菲律宾经济情况的报告说，菲律宾经济正在处在一个危险的境地，外汇储备下降到一九四九年以来最低的水平，而对外贸易的逆差的数字也是五年来最大的。
    报告说，今年六月底的外汇储备比去年年底减少了二千四百六十六万美元，比去年九月份开始下降时减少了五千七百六十七万美元。
    报告又说，在对外贸易方面，今年头四个月的进口贸易比去年同一时期增加了二千六百四十万美元，但是，今年头四个月的出口贸易却比去年同一时期减少了一千三百七十万美元。（据新华社讯）
