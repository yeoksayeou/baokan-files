　　To Find More Oil Resources for the Motherland

Comrade Editor:

　　I am a young member of the 101st Geological Survey Team of the Yumen Mining Bureau's Geological Survey Office. We are searching for underground mineral deposits for the motherland to supply the needs of the great socialist construction.

　　Last year, we conducted a general survey in the Qilian Mountains, which are over 3,000 meters above sea level. We climbed over mountains, crossed rapid rivers, and our footprints covered many places that no one had been to for many years. Here, the mountain tops are covered with thick snow all year round, the air is thin, and heavy snow falls in September and October. The hands and feet of many comrades were frozen red and swollen, some were frozen unconscious, and sometimes the weather was so cold that even the screws of the instruments could not be turned. However, no matter how cold the weather was, we persisted in our work. In such an environment, we completed more than 176 percent of the national plan last year.

　　This year, we went to work in the western section of the Mazong Mountains. In these desolate and uninhabited mountains, on this virgin land without any geological data, we carried out arduous and glorious exploration activities. From the beginning of May when we entered the mountains until now, we have not met a single person in the area of more than 10,000 square kilometers. Here, water is scarce, and a spring or well can only be found every tens of kilometers, and some must be re-excavated before they can be used for drinking. Every time we leave a water source without finding a new one, we don't wash our faces or rinse our mouths, saving the only water in the water tank for drinking. It is very easy to get lost in the chaotic mountains. Once, when we moved our work location, we lost contact with the guide and groped from morning until night before we found the camel's footprints and found the way. The climate in the Mazong Mountains is changeable. During the day, it is so hot that people can hardly breathe. Walking in sneakers, the soles of their feet are hot. We worked back and forth, unwilling to sit down and eat a dry steamed bun, but chewed it while walking. Sometimes, when a whirlwind blows, we cannot walk during the day, so we walk at night and continue working the next day. Although there are many difficulties, in order to find more oil fields for the country, we launched a labor competition of "overcoming difficulties, improving quality, and overfulfilling tasks." We constantly improve our working methods, improve labor organization, and learn and improve our skills. In this way, from the beginning of May to the end of July, we have already overfulfilled the field work tasks in the national plan for the whole year ahead of schedule.

　　In the deep mountains, we are always concerned about the national construction cause. Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out to us in the "Report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" the glorious task of "must strive to find more oil resources." We will redouble our efforts, overcome all kinds of difficulties, and find more and richer oil fields for the country.

### 为祖国寻找更多的石油资源

　　为祖国寻找更多的石油资源编辑同志：
    我是玉门矿务局地质调查处一○一地质普查队一个年轻的队员。我们正在为祖国寻找地下的矿藏，来供给伟大的社会主义建设的需要。
    去年，我们曾经在海拔三千公尺以上的祁连山里做过普查工作。我们翻越山岭，渡过急川，足迹踏遍了许多多少年来没有人到过的地方。这里，山顶上终年积着厚厚的雪，空气稀薄，在九、十月间就下大雪。许多同志的手脚被冻得红肿了，有的人被冻昏了，有时天气冷得就连仪器的螺丝都扭不动。但是，无论天气多么冷，我们仍然坚持着工作，就在这样的环境中，我们去年完成了国家计划百分之一百七十六以上。
    今年我们到马鬃山西段工作。在这个荒无人烟的乱山里，在这个没有任何地质资料的处女地上，我们进行了艰苦而光荣的探险活动。从五月初进到山里一直到现在，我们在一万多平方公里的地区内没有遇见过一个人。这里水源缺乏，隔几十公里才能找到一个水泉或水井，而且有的还必须重新挖掘以后才能饮用。我们每次在离开一处水源而没有找到新水源的时候，都不洗脸，不盥口，把水箱里仅有的水节省着喝。在乱山丛中是很容易迷失方向的。有一次，我们迁移工作地点，因为同向导失掉联系，从清晨一直摸到晚上，才发现了骆驼的脚踪找到了路。马鬃山里的气候是多变的，白天热得使人喘不过气来，穿着球鞋走路脚底发烫；我们往返奔驰地工作着，连坐下来吃一个干馍馍都不愿意，而是一边走一边咀嚼着。有时候刮起旋风来，白天不能走路，我们就在晚上走路，第二天继续工作。困难虽是很多的，但是为了给国家找到更多的石油田，我们开展了“克服困难，提高质量，超额完成任务”的劳动竞赛。我们不断地改进工作方法，改善劳动组织，学习和提高技术。这样，我们从五月初到七月底已经提前超额完成了全年国家计划中的野外工作任务。
    在深山里，我们时刻关心着国家建设事业。李富春副总理在“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”中给我们指出了“必须努力地去找寻更多的石油资源”的光荣任务。我们一定加倍努力，克服各种困难，为国家找出更多更丰富的油田来。
