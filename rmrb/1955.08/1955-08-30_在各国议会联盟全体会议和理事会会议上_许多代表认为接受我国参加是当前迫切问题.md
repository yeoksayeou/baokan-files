Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, August 29th - The Inter-Parliamentary Union Council held a meeting on the 27th to discuss the issue of the People's Republic of China's application to join the Union. This meeting was originally scheduled for the 30th. News reports here indicate that the Council meeting was brought forward because the Union's Executive Committee, under pressure from the United States, had unreasonably delayed discussion of China's participation in the Union, which aroused criticism and dissatisfaction from many Union members.

According to news reports, at the Council meeting on the 27th, the calls for accepting the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic into the Union were even louder. Many speakers believed that accepting China's participation was a pressing issue for the Union. They also pointed out that refusing China's participation was a violation of the Union's charter and was inconsistent with the Union's spirit of peaceful coexistence between countries with different political and social systems.

The United States' representative opposed the Council discussing China's participation in the Union at the meeting. The Council meeting did not reach a conclusion. The meeting will continue on the 30th.

On the 28th, major Helsinki newspapers all published summaries of Li Yimang's letter to Lord Stansgate, Chairman of the Union. In the letter, Li Yimang requested the Union Council and the General Assembly to correct the Executive Committee's erroneous decision to obstruct China's participation in the Union.

At the Union General Assembly plenary sessions on the 26th and 27th, many delegates continued to speak out in support of China's participation in the Union. Representatives from the Soviet Union, Romania, and Hungary pointed out in their speeches the importance of China's participation in the Union for promoting peaceful coexistence and international cooperation. Finnish representative Kuufinen, when talking about the Union's aim of promoting international peace and cooperation, stressed the necessity of accepting representatives from China, a country with 600 million people, into the Union. British representative Robinson pointed out that excluding China from the Union would inevitably undermine the Union's principles. Belgian representative Roland requested the current General Assembly to decide whether to accept China's participation. He said, "Even the governments of the countries participating in the General Assembly have already recognized the need to meet with China at major international conferences. Is it reasonable for an organization like the Inter-Parliamentary Union to adopt an even more stubborn attitude than official bodies?" Representatives from India, Ceylon, Norway, and other countries also emphasized China's important position in the international arena in their speeches.

According to Xinhua News Agency, "Izvestia" reporters Jedkov and Sevrikov, reporting from Helsinki on the issue of accepting the People's Republic of China's delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, said that many delegates speaking at the meeting pointed out that this issue must be resolved satisfactorily before the end of the General Assembly so that representatives of the People's China can participate in this conference. This issue is reasonably linked to the task of enhancing the role of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and increasing its influence in international life. Speakers at the meeting said that without the participation of the People's China, which has made enormous contributions to the cause of peace, the Inter-Parliamentary Union cannot play its proper role in the struggle for peace. Accepting the People's China is the most important practical action taken by the Inter-Parliamentary Union in resolving the issue of peaceful coexistence and cooperation between countries.

The reporters concluded by saying that the issue of the People's Republic of China's participation in the Inter-Parliamentary Union has been elevated to an important position in the work of the General Assembly.

　　在各国议会联盟全体会议和理事会会议上
　　许多代表认为接受我国参加是当前迫切问题
    新华社赫尔辛基二十九日电　各国议会联盟理事会二十七日举行会议，讨论中华人民共和国要求参加联盟的问题。这次会议原定是在三十日举行的，此间报纸消息表明，理事会会议之所以提前举行，是由于联盟执行委员会在美国胁持下无理拖延讨论中国参加联盟的行为引起了联盟许多会员的批评和不满。
    据报纸消息报道，在二十七日理事会会议上，主张接受中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国参加联盟的呼声更为高涨。许多发言者都认为接受中国参加是联盟当前的迫切问题。他们还指出，拒绝中国参加是违反联盟章程，并且同联盟所主张的不同政治和社会制度国家和平共处的精神不符的。
    美国的代表在会议上反对理事会讨论中国参加联盟的问题。理事会会议的讨论没有得出结果。三十日将继续开会讨论。
    二十八日赫尔辛基各大报都摘要刊载了李一氓致联盟主席斯坦斯盖特勋爵的信，李一氓在信中要求联盟理事会和大会纠正执行委员会阻挠中国参加联盟的错误决定。
    在联盟大会二十六日和二十七日的全体会议上，继续有许多代表发言表示支持中国参加联盟。苏联、罗马尼亚和匈牙利代表在发言中指出中国参加联盟对于促进和平共处和国际合作的重要意义。芬兰代表库芬宁在谈到联盟促进国际和平和合作的宗旨时强调指出接受六亿人口的中国代表参加联盟是必要的。英国代表罗宾逊指出，把中国排斥在联盟之外，不可能不损害联盟的原则。比利时代表罗兰要求本届大会决定是否接受中国参加的问题。他说，甚至参加大会的各国的政府都已经承认有必要在重大的国际会议上和中国会晤，像各国议会联盟这样的组织竟采取比官方还要顽固的态度，难道是合理的吗？印度、锡兰、挪威和其他国家的代表在发言中也都强调指出中国在国际上的重要地位。
    据新华社讯　“消息报”记者杰德科夫和塞夫里科夫自赫尔辛基报道谈到关于接受中华人民共和国人民代表团参加各国议会联盟的问题时说，在会上发言的许多代表都指出，必须在大会结束之前圆满地解决这个问题，以便人民中国的代表能够参加这次大会。这个问题是同提高各国议会联盟的作用以及提高它在国际生活中的影响这一任务合理地联系在一起的。在会上发言的人说，没有对和平事业作出巨大贡献的人民中国的参加，各国议会联盟就起不了它在争取和平的斗争中所应起的作用。接受人民中国参加，这就是各国议会联盟在解决各国之间和平共处和合作的问题上采取的最重要的实际的行动。
    记者最后说，关于中华人民共和国参加各国议会联盟的问题，在大会工作中已经被提到重要的地位上来。
