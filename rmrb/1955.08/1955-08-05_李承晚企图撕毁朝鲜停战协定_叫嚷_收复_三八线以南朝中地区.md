Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 4th: Seoul dispatch: Disregarding the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the Syngman Rhee government issued a statement on the evening of the 1st, demanding that the Korean and Chinese side withdraw from areas south of the 38th parallel. The statement also reiterated the absurd notion that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should withdraw from South Korea. Syngman Rhee government spokesman Gal Hong-gi threatened on the 2nd that the Syngman Rhee government would take "positive actions, including the use of force" to realize its demands.

On the 3rd, cabinet members and military leaders of the Syngman Rhee government held a secret meeting in Seoul. According to Lee Hyung-geun, "Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff," before the meeting, the meeting was to discuss the implementation of the decision on "recovering" the areas controlled by the Korean and Chinese side south of the 38th parallel, and to discuss "practical measures" to "expel" the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from South Korea.

On the 4th, Syngman Rhee repeated his "northward advance" clamor at a press conference. He openly opposed the recent four-nation government summit or "any other East-West talks." This exposes that the Syngman Rhee clique attempts to use the threat of undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement to oppose the trend of easing international tensions.

    李承晚企图撕毁朝鲜停战协定
    叫嚷“收复”三八线以南朝中地区
    新华社平壤四日电　汉城消息：李承晚政府不顾朝鲜停战协定的规定，在一日晚发表声明竟要求朝中方面退出三八线以南地区。声明同时还再次提出要中立国监察委员会退出南朝鲜的谬论。李承晚政府发言人葛弘基二日威胁说，李承晚政府将采取“包括武力的积极行动”来实现它的要求。
    三日，李承晚政府阁员和军事首脑在汉城举行了秘密会议。据“参谋长联席会议主席”李亨根在会前透露，这次会议是讨论执行关于“收复”三八线以南的朝中方面控制地区的决定问题，并且讨论把中立国监察委员会的捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员“逐出”南朝鲜的“实际措施”。
    李承晚四日在记者招待会上重复了他的“北进”的叫嚷。他公开表示反对最近的四国政府首脑会议或“任何其他的东西方会谈”。这就暴露出，李承晚集团企图用破坏朝鲜停战协定的威胁来反对国际紧张局势的趋向和缓。
