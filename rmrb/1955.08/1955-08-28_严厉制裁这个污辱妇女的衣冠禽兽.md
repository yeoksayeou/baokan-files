Severely Punish This Beast in Human Clothing Who Insults Women

Comrade Editor:

	With unparalleled anger, I am writing to you to accuse Liu Hanyi, the vice president of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Hospital, of the crime of raping women. Liu Hanyi is an "old cadre" and a "Communist Party member," yet he uses the power of the Party and the administration to rape countless young women! And I am one of the women who was insulted by his despicable means.

	In 1951, I joined the nursing school of the Iron and Steel Plant Hospital, and Liu Hanyi was the principal of our school. In June 1952, when I was only seventeen years old, Liu Hanyi called me to his home three times in a row. The first time, he told me to study hard; the second time, he told me to apply to join the Party; the third time, he said he wanted to introduce me to a partner, and that his wife was not at home, and he was suffering emotionally, and wanted me to help him solve his difficulties. After hearing these words, I was very scared and hurried to run out; but he desperately grabbed me and raped me. Afterwards, he threatened me, saying, "If you tell others, you will be criticized in a meeting and expelled from the factory!" Because I was very young at the time and politically naive, I endured the pain and humiliation in silence.

	After I started working, Liu Hanyi often came to the studio to harass me when I was on the night shift; what was even worse was that he used "individual Party membership talks" and "reporting on the situation" as a cover to rape me several times in a row. He even said inhumanely, "Don't be afraid, if you get pregnant, I'll give you medicine to have an abortion." Later, he even wanted me to find a partner to marry, and then have secret affairs with him. Liu Hanyi could actually say such things, does he even deserve to be called a "person"? No, he has no human smell at all, he is a beast in human clothing!

	In October 1952, he introduced me to the Party; at that time, because I was not old enough, he suggested that I falsely report my age as nineteen. After that, he often threatened me, saying, "If you tell others about our affair, you will be expelled from the Party immediately; it doesn't matter to me, I'm an old cadre, the Party will take care of me!"

	Liu Hanyi's behavior of insulting women is consistent. According to the facts that have now been ascertained, during his tenure in our hospital, he also raped two other female comrades using the same despicable means.

	Liu Hanyi's crimes have aroused extreme anger among all the staff in the hospital. However, the hospital Party branch only gave Liu Hanyi a two-year probation within the Party, as if such a beast in human clothing who is not fit to be a person could continue to stay in the Party and tarnish the glorious title of Communist Party member. Due to continuous opinions from the masses, the Party branch had no choice but to submit the issue of expelling Liu Hanyi from the Party to the factory Party committee for study. I believe that Liu Hanyi's criminal behavior should not only be subject to Party discipline, but also to legal sanctions. However, what is strange is that when I was preparing to file a complaint with the People's Court, Bo Hongchuan, the president of our hospital, immediately talked to me, saying that "the matter has passed, and it will not do you any good to make a big deal out of it." Xu Zijing, the secretary of the Party branch, and Yuan Ziqing, the Party organization member, also tried their best to stop me from doing so. There is a reason why they are afraid of me filing a complaint with the People's Court. Yuan Ziqing himself is a person full of hooliganism. When he asked me about Liu Hanyi's crimes, he didn't ask about the nature of the matter, but asked me to talk in detail about what form Liu Hanyi used to rape me, and shamelessly asked me to draw the situation at that time.

	Comrade Editor, I am an insulted and harmed person, and I have been living in silence for a long time. Now, seeing Comrade Zhang Baotong of our factory struggling against bad people and bad things, I have increased my courage and confidence to appeal this matter. Therefore, I wrote this letter to you, please support my just demands: give Liu Hanyi legal sanctions, and conduct a serious inspection and handling of the ugly behavior of other leaders in this hospital.

### 严厉制裁这个污辱妇女的衣冠禽兽

　　严厉制裁这个污辱妇女的衣冠禽兽编辑同志：
    我以无比愤怒的心情，向你们控诉太原钢铁厂医院副院长刘汉义强奸妇女的罪行。刘汉义是一个“老干部”、一个“共产党员”，他利用党和行政的职权，不知奸污了多少青年妇女！而我，就是被他用卑鄙手段污辱了的妇女中的一个。
    我在一九五一年参加钢铁厂医院护士学校学习，刘汉义是我们学校的校长。一九五二年六月，那时我才十七岁，刘汉义连着叫我到他家里去了三次。第一次叫我好好学习；第二次叫我申请入党；第三次就说要给我介绍爱人，并说他的爱人不在家，精神上很痛苦，要我给他解决困难。我听了这些话以后很害怕，急着向外跑；但是他拚命地拉住我，就把我奸污了。事后，他又威胁我说：“你向别人说，就要开会斗争你，开除你出厂！”因为我当时年纪很小，政治上幼稚无知，就委屈地忍受着痛苦和污辱。
    我参加工作以后，刘汉义经常在我上夜班的时候到工作室来和我纠缠；更恶劣的是，他利用“入党个别谈话”和“汇报情况”作幌子，连续强奸我几次。他还曾毫无人性地说：“不用怕，有了孕我给你吃药打胎。”后来，他竟要我找一个对象结婚，然后和他暗中来往。刘汉义居然能够说出这样的话来，难道他还配得上叫做一个“人”吗？不，他丝毫没有人的气味，他是一个衣冠禽兽！
    一九五二年十月，他介绍我入了党；当时因为我年龄不够，他就出主意让我假报为十九周岁。此后他就经常威胁我说：“我们的事你要是向别人说了，马上就开除你出党；我倒没有什么关系，老干部?，党会照顾的！”
    刘汉义污辱妇女的行为是一贯的。仅据现在已经查明的事实，他在我们医院任职期间，还曾用同样的卑污手段强奸了其他两个女同志。
    刘汉义的罪行已经引起了全院工作人员的极度愤怒。但是医院党支部却只给刘汉义留党察看两年的处分，似乎这样一个不配做人的衣冠禽兽还可以继续留在党内，沾污共产党员的光荣称号。由于群众不断提出意见，党支部才不得不把开除刘汉义党籍的问题提交给厂党委会去研究。我认为，刘汉义的罪恶行为不但应该受到党纪的处分，而且应该受到法律的制裁。但是，令人奇怪的是，当我准备向人民法院提出控诉时，我们医院的薄宏川院长立即找我谈话，说是“事情已经过去了，闹大了对你也没有好处”。党支部书记续子敬和党组织委员原子清也极力阻止我这样做。他们害怕我向人民法院控诉，绝不是没有原因的。原子清本人就是一个流氓行为十足的人，他在向我了解刘汉义的罪行时，不问这件事情的性质，却要我详尽地谈刘汉义用什么形式强奸我，并且无耻地要我画出当时的情状来。
    编辑同志，我是一个被污辱被损害的人，我长期以来忍气吞声地生活着。现在，看到了我们厂的张宝桐同志对坏人坏事作斗争的事情，增加了我要申诉这件事情的勇气和信心。因此，我给你们写了这封信，请你们支持我的正义要求：给刘汉义以法律制裁，并对这个医院其他领导人员的丑恶行为进行认真的检查和处理。
