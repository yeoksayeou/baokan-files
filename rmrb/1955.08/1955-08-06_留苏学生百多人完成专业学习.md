More Than One Hundred Students Returning from the Soviet Union Complete Their Professional Studies

More than one hundred and ten students sent by our country to study in the Soviet Union have completed their professional studies this year. So far, more than forty of them have returned to China to participate in national construction.

This group of graduates was sent to the Soviet Union for studies in 1951, including more than eighty postgraduates and more than twenty undergraduates. Among the postgraduates and undergraduates, about thirty studied engineering, and the remaining students studied transportation, construction, medicine, finance, and other majors. These students were distributed in universities and scientific research institutions such as Moscow University, Leningrad University, Moscow Power Engineering Institute, Moscow Institute of Architecture and Civil Engineering, and Moscow Bauman Higher Technical School. In addition to remedial foreign language courses, they generally engaged in three to four years of professional studies in the Soviet Union.

During their studies in the Soviet Union, the students received care and specific guidance from the Soviet government, schools, and teachers, and achieved excellent results. Many students frequently received perfect scores. After completing their studies and passing their graduation thesis or graduation design defense, some students obtained the Candidate of Sciences degree.

The returned students from the Soviet Union have been assigned by the government to work in scientific research, teaching, and production in units such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Railways. Some students assigned to the Ministry of Water Resources have been transferred to participate in the work of harnessing the Yellow River. (Xinhua News Agency)

    留苏学生百多人完成专业学习
    我国派赴苏联的留学生今年有一百一十多人完成专业学习，到目前为止已有四十多人先后回国参加国家建设工作。
    这批毕业学生是在一九五一年派赴苏联学习的，其中有研究生八十多人，大学生二十多人。研究生和大学生中学习工科的约三十人，其余学生分别学习交通运输、建筑、医药、财经等专业。这些留学生分布在莫斯科大学、列宁格勒大学、莫斯科动力学院、莫斯科建筑工程学院、莫斯科鲍曼高等技术学院等高等学校和科学研究机关学习。他们在苏联除补习外国语文外，一般都进行了三年到四年的专业学习。
    留学生们在苏联学习期间，受到苏联政府、学校、教师的关怀和具体指导，获得了优良成绩，许多学生的功课经常得到五分。学生们在结束学习通过了毕业论文或毕业设计答辩后，有的获得了候补博士学位。
    回国的留苏学生已由政府分配参加中国科学院、高等教育部、燃料工业部、水利部、卫生部、铁道部等单位从事科学研究工作、教学工作和生产工作。分配到水利部的部分学生已调往参加治理黄河的工作。　（新华社）
