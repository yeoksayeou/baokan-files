    The Role of Party Organizations in the Struggle to Transform Nature
    -- Interviews with Delegates to the CPC Gansu Provincial Congress
    By our reporter Yuan Liang
    At the CPC Gansu Provincial Congress held from June 7th to 17th, Li Jinglin, the Third Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, delivered a report on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee entitled "Report on Agricultural Mutual Aid and Cooperation and Increased Production." The report affirmed the achievements and experiences of Gansu's Party organizations in leading the masses to transform nature. During the conference, the reporter interviewed relevant representatives on this issue.
    Gansu is a province with vast areas and complex natural conditions. There are arid regions with extremely scarce rainfall, as well as large-scale irrigation areas; there are beaches plagued by drifting sand, and grasslands with lush water and grass; there are loess hilly areas, and forested mountainous areas. These differences in geographical conditions indicate that agricultural production in various regions has different characteristics. In order to unleash the potential of these lands and achieve the goal of increasing production, the Party organizations in Gansu Province, while leading the peasants to gradually realize agricultural cooperation, also led the peasants to begin a great struggle to transform nature—a struggle that also changed people's understanding of nature.
    Changing People's Understanding of Nature
    If the Party wants to mobilize the broad masses of peasants to fight against natural disasters, it must first eliminate the peasants' erroneous understanding of natural phenomena brought about by the old society so they can grasp the laws of natural development.
    Twenty-seven counties in central Gansu Province are known as drought-stricken areas. Taking Dingxi Prefecture as an example, the average annual rainfall is only 250 millimeters, and some places have even less rainfall, with a saying that "nine years out of ten are drought years." But whenever there is a lack of rain, the farmers do not actively build water conservancy projects, but instead seek gods and worship Buddhas everywhere, which delays production. Therefore, the local Party organizations decided to guide the peasants' actions onto the right path.
    In the summer of 1953, the staff of Gao Ya District in Yuzhong County wanted to help farmers find water sources and build small-scale water conservancy projects. At that time, many farmers said indifferently: Even if it doesn't rain, watering won't help! The staff found a spring in a mountain gully. After repeated mobilization, some farmers reluctantly participated in the construction of the canal. During the canal construction, an old man named Zhang refused to let the canal pass by the edge of his land, saying that "yin water soaks, the sun shines - yin and yang clash, and the crops will die." The staff repeatedly tried to reason with him, but he always insisted on his own opinion. Finally, the staff promised that if the crops died, the government would compensate him at the price, and only then did he agree. In a few days, the wheat seedlings in his field next to the canal turned from yellow to green because of the water. At this time, he quietly went to the canal to release water, no longer afraid of "yin water soaking." Someone joked to him about this, but he didn't care and said: "It's okay to spend money and effort, but not letting me water is not okay." By the end of 1954, due to the extensive construction of small-scale water conservancy projects, 100,980 mu of dry land in Dingxi Prefecture was turned into paddy fields.
    Some Party organizations also actively led peasants to divert water for irrigation. For example, in Jingyuan County, there is a dry riverbed called the Sha River. Every year in May and June, even if it does not rain locally, there will be raging floods in this riverbed, constantly destroying the crops on both sides. In the spring of 1952, the local Party committee decided to lead the peasants to turn this "harmful river" into a "beneficial river," but many peasants did not agree. They said, "What's the use of digging ditches and canals?" "The older generation couldn't do it, how can we do it?" In order to educate the peasants, the county Party committee organized them to visit the flood irrigation areas and helped the masses analyze the reasons for the "flood disasters" in the old society, so that the masses understood the benefits and methods of diverting water for irrigation. In this way, the peasants, under the personal leadership of the county Party secretary and the county magistrate, built a canal more than ten miles long along the riverbank. In June and July of 1954, this canal flowed with floodwaters containing black fertilizer, irrigating two to three hundred mu of land. That autumn, the millet in these fields grew to be half a person tall, and the ears were a foot long.
    In addition to leading the peasants to build small-scale water conservancy projects, Party organizations at all levels also led the peasants to improve farming methods. The CPC Dingxi Prefectural Committee studied and grasped the law of weather changes, knowing that "the riverbeds are dry in April, and the mountains are dry in May" (the riverbeds are mostly dry around April in the lunar calendar, and the mountains are mostly dry around May in the lunar calendar), and most of the rainfall in the region is concentrated in July, August, and September, and autumn crops are more stable than summer crops, so they proposed a method to increase the planting area of autumn fields. This year, the entire region has converted 400,000 mu of summer fields to autumn crops, and it is estimated that at least 40 million jin of grain and 60 to 70 million jin of feed can be increased each year.
    Conquering Wind and Sand Disasters
    "Since the Communist Party came, things that have never been done since ancient times have been done." The people of Jinta County will never forget the deeds of the local Party organization leading them to overcome sand hazards.
    People remember: In the past, every spring, the wind would roll up drifting sand, either filling the canals or burying the crops. According to statistics, the farmland in Jinta County that suffers from sand damage every year accounts for about 20 percent of the total cultivated area. Residents in disaster areas have moved elsewhere, living a wandering life. Before liberation, in this county with only more than 50,000 people, there were often about 10,000 farmers who wandered to other places.
    After the land reform, Ma Nengyuan, the former secretary of the CPC Jinta County Committee, was determined to lead the peasants to overcome this sand hazard. Ma Nengyuan often braved wind, sand, and snow to visit old farmers in the countryside. At that time, the old farmers' answers were: Besides planting windbreaks (setting up a fence of firewood and grass on the edge of the field to prevent sand) and planting trees and forests, there is no other way. But windbreaks are powerless to resist larger sandstorms; afforestation is a long-term task.
    Ma Nengyuan continued to look for solutions. During a canal excavation, Ma Nengyuan discovered that the sand buried under the soil layer had bonded into clumps with grass roots and tree roots. He wondered if yellow soil could be used to bury sand dunes? So he gathered farmers from the disaster areas for a discussion and submitted his opinion to the county committee for discussion. Finally, the county committee agreed with his opinion and made a decision to suppress the sand, and mobilized the masses to fight against the wind and sand with the slogan "If people don't destroy the sand, the sand will destroy people." On April 9, 1952, the battle to advance to the sand dunes began. The county and district cadres and more than 600 migrant workers from several townships jointly pressed the "Chao Lake Sand Dune" with firewood, stones, and wet soil. After five days, this sand dune with an area of 100 mu and nearly three zhang high was subdued. From then on, the peasants in the county launched a struggle against the wind and sand. In recent years, dozens of large and small sand dunes with a total area of more than 5,000 mu in the county have been covered and suppressed, and grass and trees have been planted around these sand dunes, turning the sand dunes into grassy mountains. In this way, more than 36,600 mu of farmland and twelve canals in Jinta County have been rescued from the threat of wind and sand.
    Now, the leading organs of Jinta County believe that continuing to fight against wind and sand is still a regular central task. This spring alone, they led the masses to bury 1,480 mu of sand dunes and planted a large number of trees. Jinta County has also established a forestry station, preparing to guide the masses to build a sand control forest belt more than 100 li long in the northwest of the county.
    The natural appearance of Jinta is changing. In a few years, it will no longer be a region where wind and sand fill the sky and sand mountains chase people away.
    Turning Poor Villages into Rich Villages
    According to the measurement of the Shanzhou Hydrological Station: the mud and sand flowing into the Yellow River from the major rivers in Gansu Province (such as the Wei River, Jing River, and Datong River) amounts to about 330 million cubic meters every year. The mud and sand contain about 11.5 million tons of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer. The nitrogen fertilizer alone is about 1,000 times the amount of nitrogen fertilizer contained in the oil cake planned to be supplied by Gansu Province this year. It is no wonder that the farmers in the hilly and gully areas of Tianshui, Qingyang, and Pingliang say: "After a heavy rain, everything is washed away (soil is gone, manure is gone, seeds are gone)." In addition, in order to make a living, farmers have always adopted the method of "extensive planting and low harvest," indiscriminately reclaiming mountain slopes and wasteland, which greatly damaged the forest and wild grass cover capacity and aggravated soil erosion. The result is "the poorer you are, the more you reclaim, and the more you reclaim, the poorer you become."
    After liberation, Party organizations led the masses of peasants to carry out comprehensive soil and water conservation work in some areas. As of the end of last year, the main areas of the province had completed more than 2 million mu of field projects such as cultivating field ridges and digging field ditch terraces, more than 19,000 flood control ditches, afforestation and closing hills for forest cultivation of more than 1.3 million mu, planting sweet clover of more than 700,000 mu, and built a large number of various valley dikes, waterlogged ponds, and water storage weirs. All these soil and water conservation projects, large and small, have initially shown their important role in developing agricultural production. Dengjiabao is an example.
    Dengjiabao is a mountain village on the south bank of the Wei River in Wushan County, Tianshui Prefecture. The village is surrounded by several large gullies. For decades, due to the erosion of rain, small gullies have become large gullies, and fertile fields have become barren land. There is no grass on the mountains, no trees on the slopes, and the grain yield is extremely low. Farmers lack fertilizer, feed, and fuel. Not only can they not eat their fill all year round, but even to burn a bunch of firewood, they have to go to a place eighty miles away. But now it has changed. Hundreds of large dams have been built in the gullies, countless field ridges have been built in the fields, and more than 10,000 trees have been planted around the village, and more than 30 mu of sweet clover has been planted. The yield per mu of land in Dengjiabao has increased from 80 jin in 1950 to 124 jin (the yield in 1954). The original 22 grain-deficient households in the village have now become self-sufficient households and surplus grain households; last year, the surplus grain households sold 6,300 jin of surplus grain to the state. The peasants said: "Our Dengjiabao has changed from a poor village to a rich village!"
    However, Dengjiabao's transformation from poverty to wealth has gone through a tortuous road. In July 1952, the Wushan County Party Committee working group went to Dengjiabao to test soil and water conservation work. At that time, the peasants had many ideological concerns. They were afraid that digging field ditch terraces would not grow crops; they were afraid that there would be too few people to accomplish things. The working group helped the peasants dig field ditches and cultivate field ridges. The following year, the peasants saw with their own eyes that the land cultivated with field ridges could store water, preserve moisture, and the crops were good and the yield was high, eliminating their concerns. At this time, soil and water conservation work gradually unfolded with the mutual aid group as the center.
    "Snow Water is Grain"
    The Hexi Corridor (including Wuwei and Jiuquan Prefectures) is a large-scale irrigation area hundreds of kilometers long and tens of kilometers wide, and now more than 5 million mu of farmland rely entirely on the snow water of the Qilian Mountains for irrigation. The characteristic of snow water is that "the drier the weather, the more abundant the water." In 1952 and 1953, just when Dingxi and other places were drought-stricken, the Hexi Corridor won a bumper harvest because it relied on snow water for irrigation. Therefore, the peasants said: Snow water is grain, snow water is the lifeline.
    Before liberation, because of the darkness of the water regulations and the dilapidated canals, the peasants' fields often did not receive timely and sufficient irrigation. After liberation, the Zhangye County Party Committee carried out a series of water conservancy rectification work. In 1953, it led the masses to reform the water regulations and formulated new water conservancy covenants; promoted peasant activists to participate in water conservancy management work; and rectified the ideological style of water conservancy workers. The county Party committee also led the masses to carry out the work of merging canals and renovating sluice gates; initially implemented centralized rotational irrigation, changed serial irrigation to ridge irrigation, and changed deep irrigation (irrigating one meter deep) to "thin irrigation and frequent watering," etc. By 1954, the county had promoted advanced irrigation methods, established a shift handover system and responsibility system for upstream and downstream neighbors and village neighbors when releasing water, and strengthened the patrol inspection system of district and township staff during the water release period. All these greatly reduced water leakage and loss, increased flow velocity, shortened the rotation period from 40 days to 18 days, and adapted to the needs of crop growth.
    Soon, because the wheat field sowing period in the county was too concentrated, once the first irrigation period arrived, nearly 290,000 mu of wheat fields needed water in a few days. This caused new difficulties, and some wheat fields could not be irrigated in time, affecting the yield. Based on the fact that the maturity period of wheat in the county was early and late, the county Party committee proposed the method of "staggered sowing by region." After submitting this method to the local township staff, labor models, and old farmers for research, everyone believed that the reason why many farmers rushed to sow early in the past was because they were afraid of sowing too late and not being able to get water. Staggered sowing not only does not violate the agricultural season but also can be irrigated in time. This is a good method. After mobilization work, the farmers also accepted this method. This year, the twelve districts of the county have been divided into four types of regions (which are further divided into several small regions) and carried out staggered sowing. When the first irrigation period arrived, the phenomenon of rushing to irrigate as in previous years did not occur; at the same time, bean fields and other summer miscellaneous grain fields also obtained timely irrigation.
    Like Zhangye, the Party organizations in various counties in the Hexi Corridor also led the peasants to carry out a series of water conservancy reform work. According to the statistics of 1953 and 1954, the irrigation area in Wuwei and Jiuquan Prefectures expanded by 484,200 mu. The grain output of the counties in the Jiuquan area has increased from more than 240 million jin in 1950 to more than 440 million jin in 1954, changing the historical poverty situation of continuous grain shortage and becoming a region with a large amount of surplus grain.
    The Party organizations at all levels in Gansu Province are not satisfied with the existing achievements in transforming nature. They know that this is only the beginning of the great struggle to transform nature, and there are still various difficulties lying ahead on the road of advancement. The Party Congress requires all Party members working in rural areas to continue to lead the masses to conquer nature and strive to further improve agricultural production, according to the relevant decisions on agricultural production in the "Outline of the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of Gansu Province" unanimously adopted by the Party Congress.

    党组织在改造自然的斗争中的作用
    ——中共甘肃省代表会议代表访问记
    本报记者　袁良
    在六月七日到十七日召开的中共甘肃省代表会议上，省委第三书记李景林代表省委作了“关于农业互助合作和增加生产的报告”，报告中肯定了甘肃党组织在领导群众改造自然斗争方面的成绩和经验。在会议期间，记者就这一问题访问了有关的代表。
    甘肃是一个地区辽阔、自然条件复杂的省份。这里有雨量奇缺的干旱地区，也有较理想的大面积灌溉区；有流砂为害的滩地，也有水草肥美的草原；有黄土丘陵地带，也有森林蓊郁的山区。地理条件上的这些差异，说明了各类地区的农业生产有不同的特点。为了发挥这些土地的潜力，达到增加生产的目的，甘肃省的党组织在领导农民逐步地实现农业合作化的同时，也领导农民开始了改造自然——也是改变人们对自然的认识的伟大斗争。
    改变人对自然的认识
    党要发动广大农民群众起来同自然灾害作斗争，首先就必须清除农民从旧社会带来的对自然现象的一些错误认识，使他们能够掌握自然发展的规律。
    甘肃省中部有二十七个县是有名的干旱地区，以定西专区来说，每年的降雨量平均只有二百五十公厘，还有些地方的雨量更少，有“十年九旱”之说。但每当缺少雨水的时候，农民们不是积极兴修水利，而是到处求神拜佛，把生产都耽搁了。因此，当地的党组织决定把农民的行动引导上正确的途径。
    一九五三年夏天，榆中县高崖区的工作人员要帮助农民寻找水源，兴修小型水利。当时许多农民冷淡地说：天不下雨，浇水也不顶事！工作人员在山沟中发现了一处泉水，经过了多次动员，有些农民才勉强去参加修渠。在修渠过程中，有一位张老汉无论如何不让渠道经过自己的地边，说什么
  “阴水一泡，太阳一晒——阴阳相击，庄稼就会死去”，工作人员反复地向他讲道理，他始终坚持自己的意见。最后，工作人员答应如果庄稼死去，政府按价赔偿，他才答应下来。没有几天，他这片靠渠道的地里的麦苗因浸了水由黄变绿了，这时他就悄悄地到渠道上去放水，再不怕“阴水一泡”了。有人因此向他打趣，他却不在乎地说：“出钱出力都行，不让我浇水可不行。”到一九五四年底，由于广泛地兴修小型水利，定西专区的十万零九千八百亩干旱地变成了水田。
    也有些党组织积极领导农民引水灌溉。例如在靖远县，有一条名叫沙河的干涸的河道。每年到五、六月，即使当地不下雨，这条河道里也会出现汹涌的洪水，不断地冲毁两岸的庄稼。一九五二年春天，当地党委决心领导农民把这条“害河”变成“利河”，但有许多农民不赞成，他们说：“挖沟掏渠顶什么？”“老辈人手里弄不成，咱们能弄成吗？”县委为了教育农民，组织他们到洪灌区参观，并帮助群众分析旧社会“引洪成灾”的原因，使群众懂得了引水灌溉的好处和办法。这样，农民才在县委书记、县长的亲自领导下，沿着河岸修了一条十多里长的渠道。一九五四年六、七月份，这条渠道里流进了带有黑色肥料的洪水，灌溉了有二、三百亩土地。那年秋后，这些地里的糜谷长到半人高，穗子结了尺把长。
    各级党组织除了领导农民兴修小型水利外，还领导农民改进耕作方法。中共定西地委研究掌握了天气变化的规律，知道“四月晒川，五月晒山”
  （农历四月前后川地多旱，五月前后山地多旱），全区雨量多集中在七、八、九三个月份，秋季作物较夏季作物产量要稳定，于是提出了增加秋田播种面积的办法。今年，全区已将四十万亩夏田改种秋季作物，预计每年至少可以增产四千多万斤粮食和六、七千万斤饲草。
    征服风砂灾害
    “共产党一来，自古没有办到的事情都办到了。”金塔县人民对当地党组织领导他们战胜砂害的事迹是永远不会忘记的。
    人们都记得：过去每到春季，大风卷来流砂，不是填平了河渠，就是掩埋了庄稼。据统计，金塔县每年遭受砂害的田地，约占总耕地面积的百分之二十。灾区的居民纷纷地迁移到别处去，过着流离颠沛的生活。解放前，这个只有五万多人口的县，经常流浪到外地去的农民就有一万人左右。
    土地改革以后，前中共金塔县委书记马能元下决心要领导农民战胜这种砂害。马能元经常冒着风砂、冰雪到农村去访问老农。当时老农的回答是：除了插风墙（用柴草在地边插起一道防砂的篱笆）和植树造林以外，就再没有别的办法。但是风墙却无力抵御较大的风砂袭击；植树造林又是长期的工作。
    马能元继续寻找办法。在一次开挖渠道的工作中，马能元发现在土层底下被掩埋的砂子已经同草根、树根结成了块状。他就联想到是否可以用黄土来压埋砂丘呢？于是他召集了受灾地区的农民座谈，同时把他的意见提交县委会讨论。最后县委同意他的意见作出了压砂的决定，并用“人不灭砂、砂要灭人”的口号动员群众同风砂作斗争。一九五二年四月九日，向砂丘大进军的战斗开始了。县、区干部和几个乡联合起来的六百多名民工，用柴草、石头、湿土向“潮湖砂丘”压去。经过五天时间，这座面积一百亩大、近三丈高的砂丘就被制服了。从此以后，全县农民展开了同风砂的斗争。几年来，全县已有总面积五千多亩的数十个大小砂丘被掩压，并且在这些砂丘的周围植草种树，使砂丘变成了草山。就是这样，金塔县的三万六千六百多亩农田和十二条渠道，都从风砂的威胁下解救出了。
    现在，金塔县的领导机关认为继续同风砂作斗争，仍然是一项经常的中心工作。仅今年春季，他们又领导群众掩埋了砂丘一千四百八十亩，还大量地种植了树木。金塔县又成立了林业站，准备指导群众在县境西北建造一条一百多里长的防砂林带。
    金塔的自然面貌正在改变着，几年以后，它将不再是风砂弥天、砂山撵人的地区。
    把穷村子变成富村子
    据陕州水文站测量：由甘肃境内的几条主要河流（如渭河、泾河、大通河等）每年流入黄河的泥砂，约有三亿三千万立方公尺，泥砂中约共含氮肥、磷肥、钾肥一千一百五十万吨。其中仅氮肥一项，即等于甘肃全省今年计划供应油饼所含氮肥的一千倍左右。难怪天水、庆阳、平凉等山陵沟壑地带的农民说：“大雨过后，一冲三光（土光、粪光、籽种光）。”加上农民为了生活，历来采取“广种薄收”的办法，乱垦山坡，乱开荒地，大大地破坏了山林、野草的被覆能力，加剧了水土的流失。结果是
  “越穷越垦，越垦越穷”。
    解放以后，党组织领导农民群众在一些地区开展了综合性的水土保持工作。截至去年年底，全省主要地区已完成了培地埂、挖地坎沟等田间工程二百多万亩和防洪沟一万九千多条，造林和封山育林一百三十多万亩，种植草木樨七十多万亩，并且大量地修筑了各种谷坊、涝池、蓄水堰等。所有这些有关水土保持的大小工程已经初步显示出它们对于发展农业生产的重要作用。邓家堡就是一个例子。
    邓家堡是天水专区武山县渭河南岸的一个山村，村庄被几条大沟环抱着。几十年来，由于雨水的冲刷，小沟都变成了大沟，肥田变成了瘠地。山上无草、坡上无树，粮食产量极低，肥料、饲料、燃料俱缺。农民们不仅终年吃不饱肚子，就连烧一把柴都得到八十里路以外的地方去打。可是现在变了。沟壑里打起了数百条大坝，田地里筑起了无数的地埂，村周围种上了一万多株树木，种植了三十多亩草木樨。邓家堡的每亩土地的产量已经由一九五○年的八十斤增加到一百二十四斤（一九五四年的产量）。全村原来的二十二户缺粮户，现在都变成了自给户和余粮户；去年余粮户卖给了国家六千三百斤余粮。农民说：“我们邓家堡由穷村子变成富村子了！”
    可是邓家堡的由穷变富，是走过一段曲折道路的。一九五二年七月，武山县委工作组到邓家堡试验水土保持工作，当时农民的思想顾虑很多。怕挖了地坎沟不长庄稼；怕人少办不成事。工作组就帮助农民挖地沟，培地埂。第二年，农民亲眼看到培了地埂的地能够蓄水、保墒，庄稼好，产量高，消除了顾虑，这时水土保持工作才以互助组为中心逐步地展开了。
    “雪水就是粮食”
    河西走廊（包括武威、酒泉两专区），是数百公里长，数十公里宽的大面积灌溉区，现在有五百多万亩耕地完全靠祁连山的雪水来灌溉。雪水的特点是“天气越旱，水量越足”。一九五二、一九五三年，正当定西等地亢旱的时候，河西走廊却因靠雪水灌溉赢得了丰收。所以农民们说：雪水就是粮食，雪水就是命根子。
    解放之前，这里因为水规黑暗，渠道破烂，农民们的田地往往得不到及时的足够的灌溉。解放后张掖县委进行了一系列整顿水利的工作。一九五三年领导群众改革了水规，订立了新的水利公约；提拔农民积极分子参加了水利管理工作；整顿了水利工作人员的思想作风。县委又领导群众进行了合并渠道、整修水闸的工作；初步实行了集中轮灌，改串灌为畦田灌溉，改深灌（有灌一公尺深的）为“薄灌勤浇”等。到了一九五四年，全县又推行了先进的灌溉方法，建立了放水时上下游地邻、村邻的交接班制和责任制，加强了区、乡工作人员在放水期间的巡回检查制度。所有这些，大大地减少了水量的渗漏、流失，提高了流速，使轮灌期由四十天缩短到十八天，适应了禾苗生长的需要。
    不久，由于全县麦田播种期过于集中，头轮灌期一到，二十九万亩麦田几乎在几天内都需要放水。这样就发生了新的困难，有的麦田得不到及时灌溉，影响产量。县委根据全县麦子成熟期有早有迟的情况，提出“分区分期播种”的办法。把这个办法提交当地区乡工作人员、劳动模范和老农研究后，大家认为：许多农民过去所以抢先播种，是因为怕种得过迟，灌不上水。实行分期播种既不违农时，又可及时灌溉，这是一个好办法。经过动员工作，农民们也接受了这个办法。今年全县十二个区已经划分成了四类地区（其中又分若干小的区域），进行了分期播种。在头轮灌溉期到来时，没有发生往年那样抢灌的现象；同时豆田和其他夏杂粮田地也获得了适时灌溉。
    同张掖一样，河西走廊各县的党组织也领导农民进行了一系列的水利改革工作。根据一九五三、一九五四年的统计，武威、酒泉两专区的灌溉面积扩大了四十八万四千二百亩。酒泉地区各县的粮食产量，已由一九五○年的两亿四千多万斤增加到一九五四年的四亿四千多万斤，改变了历史上一贯缺粮食的穷困情况，变成了有大量余粮的地区。
    甘肃省的各级党组织并没有满足对自然改造的现有成绩。他们知道这只是改造自然的伟大斗争的开始，在前进的道路上还横着各种各样的困难。党代表会议要求在农村工作的全体党员，根据党代表会议一致通过的“甘肃省发展国民经济的第一个五年计划纲要”中有关农业生产的各项决定，继续带领群众征服自然，为进一步提高农业生产而奋斗。
