The Ministry of Railways, in order to ensure the supply of food and drink to passengers and to improve train order, has been focusing on implementing new food supply measures for passenger trains and platforms on the Beijing-Harbin, Beijing-Shanghai, and Beijing-Hankou lines since July 1st. On dining cars, Chinese and Western meals and snacks of different prices are prepared, and the quality and prices of food are appropriately increased. At the same time, the sales section on the train was cancelled, and the supply of inexpensive food at stations along the line was expanded. At stations suitable for meals, the stopping time was appropriately extended to facilitate passengers' dining. In terms of drinking water supply, manpower was strengthened, and a classified supply method was implemented.

In the past, due to the annual increase in passengers and the continuous improvement of the living standards of the people, the number of passengers dining in the dining car had reached more than 70 to 80 percent of the passengers on each train. However, dining car equipment and food storage area were limited, so the dining car was very crowded. Some meals had to be taken in fourteen or fifteen batches. At the same time, the number of dining car and train vendors increased, and the amount of goods they carried increased, occupying many seats. The food was also in short supply. This not only made it inconvenient for passengers to eat, but also affected the number of passengers transported, and the quality of the food could not meet the requirements of passengers. After the implementation of this new method on the three trunk lines for more than a month, the phenomena of crowded dining cars and inconvenience for passengers to eat have been eliminated, and passengers generally respond well. In September, this method will be universally implemented in railways across the country.

    铁道部改进旅客饮食供应工作
    铁道部为了保证旅客饮食品供应和改进列车秩序，从七月一日起在北京到哈尔滨、北京到上海、北京到汉口三条干线上重点实行了新的旅客列车和站台饮食供应办法。在餐车上准备不同价格的中、西餐和点心，适当地提高了食品的质量和价格。同时取消列车上的售货部分，扩大了沿线各站廉价食品的供应。在适于用饭的车站，适当地延长了停车时间，以便利旅客就餐。在饮水供应方面，加强了人力配备，实行分类供应的办法。
    过去由于旅客逐年增加和广大人民的生活不断改善，旅客在餐车就餐的人数已经达到每列车乘车旅客的百分之七十到八十以上。但是，餐车设备和餐料贮存面积等都有限制，所以餐车很拥挤，一顿饭有的要分十四、五批进餐，同时餐车和列车上的售货人员增多，携带货品增加，占用座席很多，食品还供不应求。这样，既使旅客用餐感觉不便，又影响了运送旅客的数量，饭菜的质量也不能满足旅客的要求。三条干线上实行这一新办法以后，一个多月来，消除了餐车拥挤、旅客用饭不方便等现象，旅客反映一般良好。九月间，全国各铁路将普遍实行这一办法。
