　　She Did What a Communist Youth League Member Should Do
　　Chen Hexiang
    In the area where the three counties of Biyang, Fangcheng, and Tanghe in Henan Province meet, a small group of counter-revolutionary sectarian elements was hidden. Before liberation, this small group of counter-revolutionary elements colluded with landlords and local bullies, extorting money from the masses, raping women, and committing all kinds of evil deeds through feudal superstition. In 1953, when the People's Government banned reactionary sects, they pretended to "repent" and "register as reformed." Afterwards, they carried out counter-revolutionary activities more secretly and actively. They gathered at night and dispersed during the day, developed followers, spread rumors, and undermined the implementation of various policies of the People's Government.
    In December 1954, they held several secret meetings in Yangce Town, Biyang County, and decided to organize a counter-revolutionary riot. Using threats and inducements, they conducted liaison activities in Tanghe, Fangcheng, Biyang, and other places. The targets of the liaison were backward elements among their relatives and friends, as well as those with ambiguous positions and wavering revolutionary will. In the spring of this year, these counter-revolutionary elements felt that the number of people they had contacted was almost enough, so they determined that the organization for this counter-revolutionary riot would be called the "National Salvation Army." The bandit leader Li Bingzhao was the "Commander-in-Chief," Zhang Tailing was the "Chief of Staff," and some core members were also appointed as "Regimental Commanders" and "Squad Leaders." After all the arrangements were made, they planned to start on the tenth day of the second lunar month. First, they would attack the Yangce District People's Government, rob cooperatives, bank branches, and warehouses, and then attack the county towns of Biyang, Wuyang, Fangcheng, Nanyang, etc. After "success," they would make Fangcheng the "capital" with the state name "Great Buddha Kingdom." On the night of the tenth, it rained heavily, and the people did not gather completely, so the conspiracy failed. Therefore, Li and others planned to hold a riot in Yangce Town on the sixteenth day of the third lunar month (i.e., April 8th).
    However, on the very day they launched their conspiracy riot, thanks to the report of Communist Youth League member Zhang Guifang, this small group of counter-revolutionary elements all fell into the net of justice.
    Zhang Guifang's reporting of the counter-revolutionary conspiracy demonstrated the high degree of political vigilance that revolutionary youths should possess, as well as their resourcefulness and courage in the struggle against the enemies of socialism. This fact also shows that when the people actively participate in the struggle, any conspiracy of the counter-revolutionary elements is doomed to fail.
    This spring, Communist Youth League member Zhang Guifang noticed that a man named Zhang Wenqing often came to see her husband, Fu Guangcheng. At first, she didn't pay much attention to it, because they were in the same ironware production cooperative, and Zhang Wenqing had even taught Fu Guangcheng his craft. However, Zhang Wenqing's contacts with her husband became closer and closer, and sometimes he would come to see him several times a day, surreptitiously. Her husband used to tell her everything, but now they were always whispering together behind her back; what was even stranger was that sometimes Zhang Wenqing would specifically call Guangcheng out to talk. What exactly were they talking about? Zhang Guifang was very puzzled. She had asked Guangcheng several times, but Guangcheng always hesitated and didn't say anything. She also remembered that although Zhang Wenqing was a blacksmith, he was not a good person. Before liberation, he didn't do honest work and often insulted women; after liberation, he was struggled against by the masses several times, but he didn't sincerely repent. He usually kept saying strange things and undermining the policies and decrees of the People's Government... Thinking of this, Zhang Guifang became vigilant: Zhang Wenqing must be enticing Guangcheng to do bad things!
    On April 7th, Zhang Wenqing called Guangcheng away again, and he didn't return until a long time later. As soon as Guangcheng came home, he quietly said to his mother: "Mother, don't go out tomorrow!" After hearing this, GuiFang became even more suspicious, so she questioned Guangcheng about what they were whispering about all day long. Guangcheng still hesitated. But this time, GuiFang kept pestering him and insisted that he explain clearly. Unable to avoid her, Guangcheng told his wife about Zhang Wenqing's conspiracy to connect with him and attempt to organize a riot, and said that they would start tomorrow. GuiFang was shocked and filled with both anger and hatred. She wanted to report to the People's Government immediately. But then she thought that she hadn't figured out who the leaders were, so she questioned Fu Guangcheng again. At this moment, Zhang Wenqing came again.
    It turned out that Zhang Wenqing, a core member of this counter-revolutionary group, was a follower of the Temple Doctrine Society. Because he actively carried out counter-revolutionary activities, he had been appointed by the bandit Li Bingzhao as the so-called "Commander-in-Chief" of the "National Salvation Army." The purpose of his visit this time was to connect with Fu Guangcheng and his wife, and to try to buy over her mother's cousin, Li Deshan, through Zhang Guifang. Because Li Deshan was the militia captain of the township, they could get guns from him. As soon as Zhang Wenqing entered the door, he saw them talking and asked with a smile: "You know, right, GuiFang?" GuiFang pretended not to know and asked: "What's the matter?" This counter-revolutionary element said rampantly: "Now that things are almost done, I'll tell you. Even if you report it, I'm not afraid!" He explained the plan for the riot and threatened GuiFang: "Guangcheng, you two are both Communist Youth League members. If you don't participate, then I can't guarantee what will happen..."
    In order to find out the truth, GuiFang used a trick and agreed. Immediately, she deliberately pretended to be afraid, fearing that it might not succeed. She also asked Zhang Wenqing how many people there were in total and how they were organized. Zhang Wenqing hesitated to speak. Seeing that he was hesitant and didn't dare to speak, GuiFang immediately pretended to say: "Just tell me, I guarantee I won't leak it. If you tell me, I can participate too!" Zhang Wenqing thought that GuiFang was really determined to participate, so he explained the organization and leaders of the "Temple Doctrine Society" and the "National Salvation Army" one by one. Finally, he asked her to buy over Li Deshan, saying: "Now relatives must help relatives, and neighbors must help neighbors. Your cousin is a cadre. If he doesn't participate, he can't be guaranteed; if he participates, you want him to bring the militia and guns at that time..." GuiFang also agreed.
    That night, Zhang Wenqing didn't leave until after midnight. After Zhang Wenqing left, GuiFang said to Guangcheng: "You've been tricked by the enemy!" She said: "Their riot is to overthrow the new society and let the landlords and bullies rule us again. Think about it, before liberation, our family didn't have an acre of land or a room, and lived in a thatched shed in the Zhaihao. My father begged for food, and my mother sold tea. What kind of life was that! After liberation, we were given houses and land, and our lives are getting better and better every day. You forgot your roots and want to rise up with the counter-revolutionary elements to oppose the Communist Party and Chairman Mao who liberated us. Think about it, what kind of person have you become..." After Zhang Guifang's repeated persuasion and education, Fu Guangcheng finally woke up. He told his wife that he would definitely not work with the counter-revolutionary elements. But he didn't want GuiFang to report it, because the bandit leaders had said: "Whoever is half-hearted and leaks the news will be killed." When GuiFang heard him say this, she hesitated for a moment. But she thought that if she didn't report it, the enemy would kill cadres and Party members tomorrow, and the country's grain and property would suffer significant losses. Later, she also thought that the power of the People's Government was strong and it would definitely be able to wipe out all the counter-revolutionary elements. She remembered the heroic image of Liu Hulan, who was brave and unyielding under the enemy's guillotine, which also gave her strength and courage. She was determined to do what a Communist Youth League member should do, regardless of any threats from the counter-revolutionary elements.
    After a while, it dawned. GuiFang decided to report to the District People's Government immediately. She had just picked up her child and was about to go out when she thought that if Zhang Wenqing and the others found out, wouldn't that ruin things? What should she do? She remembered that Zhang Wenqing wanted her to connect with Li Deshan, didn't he? She knew Li Deshan well and knew that he was usually active in his work and had a firm stance, so she decided to go find him. If she encountered the enemy, she would say that she was going to connect with him. Not far from the street, it happened that her younger sister from her mother's family was coming to the market, so GuiFang asked her to find Li Deshan. After Li Deshan listened to GuiFang's report, he immediately went to the district to report it quietly.
    The District People's Government already knew that this group of counter-revolutionary elements was preparing to hold a riot. After hearing Li Deshan's report, they sent someone to Zhang Guifang to learn about the specific situation and deployment of the enemy's activities. At the same time, they organized armed forces to surround Yangce Town. The enemy had originally planned to riot that night. During the day, the bandit leaders and core members pretended to be going to the market and had already gathered in the town. This small group of counter-revolutionary elements was wiped out by the People's Government before their conspiracy could succeed. Weapons such as homemade guns, broadswords, and axes were all confiscated.
    Now, this small group of counter-revolutionary criminals has been punished by the law of the country that they deserved. The People's Court sentenced them to death or imprisonment according to the seriousness of their crimes.
    Zhang Guifang, a 22-year-old Communist Youth League member, honorably participated in the Henan Provincial Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference not long ago. Her resourcefulness and courage in fighting against hidden enemies inspired every youth present. The young people understood that raising vigilance a hundredfold and safeguarding socialist construction is the sacred responsibility of the younger generation of the motherland.

　　她做了青年团员应该做的事情
　　陈鹤翔
    在河南省泌阳、方城、唐河三县交界的地方，隐藏着一小撮反革命的会道门分子。解放前，这一小撮反革命分子和地主恶霸相勾结，用封建迷信的手段，榨取群众钱财，奸淫妇女，无恶不作。一九五三年人民政府取缔反动会道门，他们曾伪装“悔过”，“登记自新”。事后他们却更加隐蔽、更加积极地进行反革命活动。他们夜聚明散，发展道徒，散布谣言，破坏人民政府各项政策的贯彻执行。
    一九五四年十二月，他们在泌阳县羊册镇进行了多次密谋，决定组织反革命暴乱。他们用威胁利诱的方法，分头在唐河、方城、泌阳等地进行串连活动。串连的对象是他们的亲戚朋友中思想落后的分子，以及立场模糊、革命意志不坚定的人。今年春天，这些反革命分子自己觉得串连的人数差不多了，就确定这个反革命暴乱的组织为“救民军”。匪首李炳照为“总帅”，张太亮为“参谋长”，另外还委任了一些骨干分子为“团长”、“队长”。一切安排停当之后，他们计划在农历二月初十动手。先打羊册区人民政府，抢合作社、银行营业所、仓库，再攻打泌阳、舞阳、方城、南阳等县城，“成功”以后，以方城为“京城”，国号“大佛国”。初十夜里下大雨，人未聚齐，阴谋未成。于是李匪等又计划在农历三月十六日（即公历四月八日）在羊册镇举行暴乱。
    但是，就在他们发动阴谋暴乱的当天，由于青年团员张桂芳的检举，这一小撮反革命分子全部落入了法网。
    张桂芳检举反革命阴谋的事实，表现了革命青年应有的高度政治警惕性，以及在同社会主义敌人进行斗争中的机智和勇敢。这个事实也说明，当人民群众积极参加斗争时，反革命分子的任何阴谋都是要失败的。
    今年春天，青年团员张桂芳发觉有个叫张文卿的人常来找自己的丈夫傅广成。开始她不怎么在意，因为他们同在一个铁业生产合作社里，张文卿还教过傅广成手艺。可是，张文卿同她丈夫的来往越来越密切了，有时鬼鬼祟祟地一天来找几次。她丈夫往常说什么话都不背着她，现在他们俩总背着她在一起咕叽咕叽；更奇怪的是，有时张文卿还特地把广成叫出去说话。他们到底说些什么事呢？张桂芳心里好纳闷。她曾几次问过广成，广成总支吾不说。她又想起，张文卿虽说是个铁匠，但也并不是好人，解放以前他不干正事，时常侮辱妇女；解放以后受到群众几次斗争，但他并不认真改悔，平常不断说怪话，破坏人民政府的政策法令……想到这里，张桂芳警惕起来：张文卿一定是在勾引广成干坏事！
    四月七日，张文卿又把广成喊走了，半天才回来。广成一回家，就悄悄地同娘说：“娘，你明天可别出门去！”桂芳听到这话以后，越发疑心了，她就追问广成；他们俩到底成天咕叽啥事。广成还是支支吾吾。但桂芳这一次纠缠住不依，非要他说明白不可。广成缠她不过，就把张文卿串连他，企图组织暴乱的阴谋，告诉了妻子，并说，明天就要动手啦。桂芳听了，大吃一惊，又是气又是恨。她想立刻去报告人民政府。但转而一想，还没有弄清楚带头的是那些人，于是又追问傅广成。正在这时，张文卿又来了。
    原来这个反革命集团的骨干分子张文卿是庙道会的道徒，因为积极进行反革命活动，已被李匪炳照封为所谓“救民军”的“总指挥”。他这次来的目的，一是串连傅广成夫妇，一是想通过张桂芳收买她娘家的表哥李德善。因为李德善当乡民兵中队长，可以从他那里取得枪枝。张文卿一进门，见到他俩正说着话，就笑着问：“知道了吧，桂芳？”桂芳装作不知道的样子问：“啥事？”这个反革命分子猖狂地说：“现在事快成了，就告诉你吧，就是你去报告也不怕了！”他就把举行暴乱的计划说了一遍，并威胁桂芳说：“广成你俩都是青年团员，要是你不参加，那我可不敢保险会出什么事……。”
    桂芳为了弄清真象，就将计就计答应下来。马上，她又故意装作害怕，怕万一成不了事。她又追问张文卿一共有多少人，怎样组织起来的。张文卿话到嘴边又留了半句，桂芳见他迟迟疑疑不敢说，就紧接着假声明一句：“你只管说吧，我保险跑不了风，说了我也好参加呀！”张文卿只当桂芳真的决心参加了，就将“庙道会”、“救民军”的组织、头目，一一说了出来。最后并要她去收买李德善，说：“现在要亲帮亲，邻帮邻，你表哥是个干部，不参加就保不了险；他要参加，你要他到时候带了民兵和枪枝来……”桂芳也都答应了。
    这一晚上，张文卿一直到大半夜才走。张文卿走后，桂芳就向广成说：“你是上了敌人的当了！”她说：“他们起来暴动，是要推翻新社会，让地主恶霸再来统治咱们。你想想，解放以前，咱家没一亩地，没一间房，在寨壕里搭个茅棚住，爹要饭，娘卖茶，那时过的啥生活！解放以后，分了房子分了地，生活一天比一天强，你倒忘了本，想跟着反革命分子起来反对解放咱们的共产党、毛主席，你想想，你成了啥人了啊……”经过张桂芳反复地说服教育，傅广成终于醒悟了。他向妻子表示一定不跟反革命分子一起干。但他又不叫桂芳去报告，因为匪首们曾说过：“谁有三心二意，走漏了风声，就杀死谁。”桂芳听他一说，也犹豫了一下。但她想到，如果不报告，敌人明天就要杀害干部和党员，国家的粮食和财产就要受到重大损失。以后她又想到，人民政府的力量是强大的，一定可以把反革命分子全部肃清。她想起了在敌人铡刀下英勇不屈的刘胡兰的英雄形象，也给了她力量和勇气。她决心不顾反革命分子的任何威胁，做一个青年团员应该做的事。
    过了一会儿，天就亮了。桂芳决定立即上区人民政府报告。她刚抱了孩子想出门，又想到，如果被张文卿他们发现，岂不反而坏了事？怎么办呢？她想起了，张文卿不是要他去串连李德善吗？李德善这个人她是了解的，平常工作积极，办事立场坚定，就决心去找他。要是碰到敌人，就说是去串连。刚走出街不远，恰巧她娘家妹子赶集来了，桂芳就叫她妹子找来李德善。李德善听完桂芳反映的情况以后，立刻就悄悄地到区上报告了。
    区人民政府原先已经知道这伙反革命分子准备举行暴乱，听到李德善的报告，就派人向张桂芳了解敌人活动的具体情况和部署。同时组织武装力量，把羊册镇包围起来。敌人原准备在这天晚上暴乱，白天，匪首和骨干分子装作赶集，都已聚集在镇上。这一小撮反革命分子，在他们的阴谋未逞之前，就被人民政府一网打尽了。土枪、大刀、斧头等武器也全被缴获。
    现在，这一小撮反革命罪犯已经受到他们应得的国法制裁。人民法院根据他们的罪恶轻重分别判处了他们死刑或徒刑。
    二十二岁的青年团员张桂芳，不久以前光荣地参加了河南省青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。她在对暗藏敌人进行斗争中的机智和勇敢，激励了每个到会的青年。青年们懂得了：百倍地提高警惕，保卫社会主义建设，是祖国青年一代的神圣责任。
