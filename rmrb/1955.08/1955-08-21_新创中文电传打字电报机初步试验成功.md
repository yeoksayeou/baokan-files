Newly Created Chinese Teleprinter Telegraph Successfully Completes Preliminary Testing

    China's first Chinese teleprinter telegraph has successfully completed preliminary testing. On the 17th, this Chinese teleprinter telegraph underwent preliminary testing in Beijing, with relevant personnel from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau attending to observe. The designers of the machine gave a brief explanation of the machine's construction, performance, etc., and then transmitted the words "Long Live the People's Republic of China" and the full text of the preamble to the "Constitution of the People's Republic of China." The text, punctuation, and paragraphs recorded on the printer were all correct and clear.
    The foreign language teleprinters that China has long used cannot directly transmit Chinese characters. It is necessary to translate the Chinese characters into code, use the numerical keys on the foreign language teleprinter to transmit them, and then translate them back into Chinese characters for the recipient to understand. Therefore, the speed and efficiency are relatively low. In order to reform this type of telegraph, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications decided to trial-produce a Chinese teleprinter telegraph that could directly transmit characters in November 1953, carried out specific designs in October 1954, and completed the trial production in June 1955.
    The successfully trial-produced Chinese teleprinter telegraph is basically the same as the foreign language teleprinter in terms of transmission principles. However, foreign language teleprinters only have thirty-odd keys, while the Chinese teleprinter has thousands of Chinese character keys. Therefore, the new machine is much more complex than the foreign language teleprinter in terms of the structure of the keys and the printing components.
    The successfully trial-produced Chinese teleprinter telegraph can arrange 4,096 Chinese characters each on the character disk and character cylinder of the typing and punching part and the printing part, and can directly punch and transmit printed text. Therefore, the cost is relatively low, and the circuit utilization rate is 66.6 percent higher than that of the foreign language teleprinter. There are still some imperfect aspects of the machine components that require further research and improvement.

　　新创中文电传打字电报机初步试验成功
    中国创造的第一部中文电传打字电报机已初步试验成功。十七日，这部中文电传打字电报机在北京作了初步试验，邮电部和北京电信局等部门有关人员都到场参观。这部机器的设计人员把机件的构造、性能等作了简要的说明以后，当场传递了“中华人民共和国万岁”等字和“中华人民共和国宪法”的序言全文。印字机上收录的文字、标点和段落都很正确而且清晰。
    中国长期使用的外文字母电传打字电报机，不能直接传递汉字，必须把汉字译成电码，利用外文字母电传打字电报机上的数码字键传递过去，再译成汉字，才能使收电人看懂，因此速度和效率都比较低。为了改革这种电报机，邮电部在一九五三年十一月就决定试制直接传递文字的中文电传打字电报机，一九五四年十月进行具体设计，一九五五年六月试制完成。
    试制成功的中文电传打字电报机，在传递原理上，同外文字母电传打字电报机基本相同。但外文字母电传打字电报机只有三十多个字键，而中文电传打字电报机有几千个中文字键，所以新机器在字键和打字机件的结构上，比外文字母电传打字电报机要复杂得多。
    试制成功的这部中文电传打字电报机打字作孔部分和印字部分的字盘和字筒上可以各排汉字四千零九十六个，能够直接作孔并电传打印文字。因此，成本比较低，电路使用率比外文字母电传打字电报机提高百分之六十六点六。现在机件上还有一些不够完善的地方，需要作进一步的研究和改进。
