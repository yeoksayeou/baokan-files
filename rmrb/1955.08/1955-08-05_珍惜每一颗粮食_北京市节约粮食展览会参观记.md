    Cherish Every Grain of Food
    —A Visit to the Beijing Municipal Exhibition on Conserving Food
    By Our Correspondent Wang Qing

    The exhibition on conserving food, currently on display in Zhongshan Park in Beijing, uses abundant materials to educate the people of the capital and employees of state organs about the necessity of cherishing every grain of food.

    Food is an indispensable resource for the country's socialist construction. Upon entering the exhibition hall, the massive pictures hanging on the walls immediately impress upon the audience the urgent need to support the nation's industrial construction with grain. Here is a corner of Anshan Iron and Steel Works, with countless chimneys standing tall, production in full swing, and a haze blurring the right side of the picture. Here is the dam and reservoir of the Fengman Hydropower Station, with giant cranes seemingly completing the final stages of reconstruction. Workers at the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory are concentrating intently on their work beside the machines. At the Fuxin open-pit coal mine, excavators in the foreground and background are extracting large quantities of coal. The oil derricks of Yumen Oilfield are arranged like layered mountains... The pictures unfold before people's eyes a scene of vigorous industrial construction in the motherland; through the pictures, people also see a more beautiful and happier vision of a socialist and communist society.

    With the development of socialist industrial construction, the amount of grain supplied to workers will inevitably increase year by year. In recent years, many new factories have opened and many mines have been developed in our country, leading to a substantial growth in the urban population. The exhibition's charts show the audience that the grain consumption in some industrial cities has generally more than doubled in recent years; in 1954, the amount of grain used in industrial and mining areas and cities accounted for 56.25% of the total national grain expenditure.

    With the development of economic construction, people's material living standards have improved significantly, and the demand for daily necessities has also grown. A chart shows that in order to continuously meet the needs of the people and supply raw materials for industry, the planting area of various cash crops is expanding. This means that the state must supply more grain to farmers in cash crop areas. The state also needs to supply grain to fishermen, salt workers, and herdsmen who produce to meet the needs of the entire nation.

    Another part of the exhibition reminds people of the importance of grain for supporting the liberation of Taiwan and strengthening national defense. Without sufficient grain, we cannot guarantee the needs of the front lines and border defenses.

    Grain does not come easily; it is the fruit of the farmers' hard labor. The exhibition uses several pictures to illustrate the arduous process of grain production—starting from plowing and delivering manure, to sowing, thinning seedlings, weeding, harvesting, and threshing. Every grain of food is soaked with the sweat of the farmers. The photograph of farmers hoeing in the fields reminds people of the famous poem: "Hoeing millet under the midday sun, sweat drips onto the soil." To ensure that every inch of land yields grain, farmers wage a tenacious struggle against natural disasters. The exhibits also tell people about the hardships of this struggle.

    In recent years, the state has invested significant resources in agriculture to increase grain production. The exhibition's statistical charts tell the audience that from 1950 to 1954, the state issued agricultural loans totaling 3.75 billion yuan, spent more than 1.6 billion yuan on water conservancy investment, and provided over 330 million yuan in water conservancy loans. From 1952 to 1954, the state distributed more than 1.22 million pieces of agricultural implements and a large quantity of agricultural chemicals. The state's substantial investment in agriculture, coupled with the hard work of the farmers and the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, has led to an increase in agricultural production in recent years. The exhibition's charts point out that during the period of economic recovery, grain production increased by an average of 13.1% per year, reaching the highest pre-war level in 1952. Due to the limitations of the small-scale peasant economy, the rate of grain production increase cannot keep up with the needs of national construction and development. However, our country's grain situation is not yet facing major difficulties. The charts show that in 1954, the total grain production in our country averaged more than 560 catties per person, which is sufficient for consumption; however, this includes feed, seeds, and grain for industrial use, so grain does not appear abundant. We must find ways to increase grain production and conserve grain.

    The exhibition explains to the audience the grave significance of conserving grain: If everyone in the country wastes one liang (50 grams) of grain per day, the whole country will waste 13.6 billion catties a year. This figure is greater than the total grain production increase in 1953 and 1954 combined. If everyone saves one liang of grain per day, the value of the grain saved each year could be exchanged for 9.58 million tons of steel or 110 complete sets of machinery and equipment for seamless steel pipe factories.

    In order to ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction and the rational supply of food to the people, the state implemented the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain in 1953. This policy was warmly welcomed by the people of the whole country, and farmers enthusiastically sold their surplus grain to the state. The exhibits explain that the implementation of the unified purchase and sale policy not only provides greater security for the country's industrial construction and makes prices more stable, and strikes at the speculative activities of unscrupulous merchants, but also increases the production funds for farmers who sell surplus grain due to reasonable purchase prices (farmers' income increased by 300 million yuan in 1953 alone), and eliminates the threat of hunger for grain-deficient farmers and disaster victims. The exhibition includes a series of cartoons that vividly illustrate the different situations of a farmer's family when they suffered two floods: Liu Ditang, a farmer in Hanshou County, Hunan Province, starved three of his six family members to death after suffering a disaster in 1931; in 1954, his hometown also experienced a major flood, but the state promptly transported grain, allowing all ten members of his family to safely survive the disaster.

    A schematic diagram hanging on the wall showing the supply of grain to the capital uses four or five neon tubes to tell people that the grain consumed in Beijing comes from the mountainous areas of Guangxi, Zhongwei in Gansu, as well as Qiqihar in the far north of the motherland and the banks of the Jialing River in Sichuan in the southwest. Beijing's grain is transported from eighteen provinces, six municipalities, and one autonomous region. This further illustrates that the people of the capital must cherish grain even more, as any waste will cause many indirect losses.

    For the rapid development of our country's industrial construction and for the early arrival of a socialist society, every exhibit in the Beijing Municipal Exhibition on Conserving Food educates people to conserve grain and cherish every grain of food!

    珍惜每一颗粮食
    ——北京市节约粮食展览会参观记
    本报记者　王青
    在北京市中山公园展出的节约粮食展览会，用丰富的资料教育首都的人民和国家机关工作人员，必须珍惜每一颗粮食。
    粮食是国家进行社会主义建设的必不可缺少的物资。走进展览会，挂在墙上的巨大的图片首先给观众以必须用粮食支援国家工业建设的强烈印象。这里是鞍钢的一角，无数烟囱林立，生产在进行，迷漫的烟雾模糊了图片的右方。这里是丰满发电站的大坝和水库，巨型的起重机似乎在完成最后的改建工程。上海机床厂的工人，正在机床旁边聚精会神地工作。在阜新露天煤矿，远处和近处的挖煤机吐吞大量煤块。玉门油矿的油塔，一座座排列得像层叠的山峦……图片在人们面前展开了祖国工业建设的蓬勃景象；透过图片，人们也看到了更加美好幸福的社会主义和共产主义社会的远景。
    随着社会主义工业建设的发展，供应工人用粮的数量也必然逐年增加。几年来，我们国家有许多新的工厂开工了，许多矿山开发了，城市人口随之有了很大的增长。展览会的图表向观众标明：一些工业城市的粮食消费量几年来一般都增加了一倍以上；在一九五四年国家粮食支出中，工矿区和城市用粮数占支出总数的百分之五十六点二五。
    随着经济建设的发展，人民物质生活有了显著提高，日用必需品的需要量也随之增长。一幅图表显示，为了不断满足人民需要，为了供应工业原料，各种经济作物的种植面积在扩大。这就意味着国家必须以更多的粮食供应经济作物区的农民。国家并要用粮食供应为满足全国人民需要而生产的渔民、盐民和牧民。
    展览会另一部分展览品提醒人们注意粮食对于支援解放台湾和加强国防建设的重要性。没有充足的粮食，我们就无法保证前线和边防的需要。
    粮食并不是轻易得来的，粮食是农民辛勤劳动的果实。展览会用若干图片说明了粮食生产的艰辛过程——从耕地、送粪开始，到播种、间苗、锄地、收割、打场，每一颗粮食都浸透着农民的汗水。农民在田里锄地的照片，使人联想起“锄禾日当午，汗滴禾下土”的有名诗句。为了使每一寸土地都能收到粮食，农民向自然灾害进行顽强的斗争。展览品也告诉了人们这种斗争的艰苦。
    几年来，国家为了增产粮食，在农业方面投入了很大的力量。展览会的统计图表告诉观众：从一九五○年到一九五四年，国家发放农业贷款三十七亿五千万元，支出水利投资十六亿多元，水利贷款三亿三千多万元。从一九五二年到一九五四年，国家发放的农具有一百二十二万多件和大批农业药品。国家对农业的大量投资，加上农民的辛勤劳动和农业互助合作运动的发展，几年来农业生产有了提高。展览会的图表指出：国家在经济恢复时期，粮食平均每年递增百分之十三点一，在一九五二年即达到战前最高水平。由于小农经济条件的限制，粮食的增产速度赶不上国家建设发展的需要。但我国的粮食并不是已经发生了多大困难，图表说明，一九五四年，我国粮食的生产总数，平均每人可得五百六十多斤，是够吃够用的；但其中包括了饲料、种籽和工业用粮，因而粮食也并不显得宽裕，必须想办法增加粮食生产和节约用粮。
    展览会向观众说明了节约粮食的严重意义：如果全国每人每天浪费一两粮食，全年将浪费一百三十六亿斤，这个数字比一九五三年和一九五四年粮食增产量的总和还大。而如果每人每天节约一两粮食，全国每年节约粮食的价值，即可换钢材九百五十八万吨，或无缝钢管厂全套机器设备一百一十套。
    为了保证社会主义建设的顺利进行和对人民食粮的合理供应，从一九五三年起，国家实行了粮食统购统销政策。这一政策受到全国人民的热烈欢迎，农民踊跃把余粮卖给国家。展览品说明，粮食统购统销政策的实施，不仅使国家工业建设更有保障，物价更加稳定，打击了奸商的投机活动，同时由于购粮价格合理，卖出余粮的农民增加了生产资金（仅一九五三年农民就增加收入三亿元），缺粮的农民和灾民也免除了饥饿的威胁。展览会中就有一幅连环画用生动的事实说明了一户农民两次遭受水灾时的不同境遇：湖南省汉寿县农民刘棣堂，在一九三一年受灾后，全家六口人饿死三口；一九五四年他的家乡也发生了大水，但国家及时运去了粮食，使他全家十口人都平安度过灾荒。
    一幅挂在墙上的供应首都粮食示意图，用四、五根霓虹管告诉人们：北京所吃用的粮食，来自广西的山区、甘肃的中卫，也来自祖国极北地带齐齐哈尔和西南的四川嘉陵江两岸。北京的粮食由全国十八个省、六个市和一个自治区运来。这就进一步说明，首都人民必须更加爱护粮食，任何一点浪费，都会造成许多间接的浪费。
    为了我们国家工业建设的迅速发展，为了社会主义社会的早日到来，北京市节约粮食展览会的每一件展览品都教育人们一定要节约粮食，珍惜每一颗粮食！
