The Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps is actively taking measures to reduce project costs and save construction funds. The design departments of the corps' engineering offices have re-examined this year's projects and have put forward more than 260 suggestions and technical measures. Now, after consultation with the basic construction units, it has been decided to cut six projects, lower the design standards of eleven projects, and modify the designs of thirty projects. Together with savings from other miscellaneous items, a total of more than 3 million yuan in construction funds can be saved for the state. For example, the Agricultural and Pastoral School, which was originally planned to be constructed this year, was designed as a three-story building, with classrooms, offices, and dormitories all together, which was inconvenient for teaching and required a large amount of investment. It has now been decided to change it to single-story houses with brick-wood and earth-wood structures, and a portion of two-story buildings with brick-wood structures. In this way, the building is both suitable and economical, and the average cost per square meter is reduced by half compared to the original, saving a total of 500,000 yuan in investment.

Currently, the design departments and various construction units of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps are still conducting in-depth research to formulate further savings plans, striving to save more construction funds for the state.

    新疆生产部队节约建设资金
    新疆军区生产建设部队积极采取措施，降低工程造价，节约建设资金。这个部队所属工程处的设计部门对今年的工程重新进行了审查，分别提出二百六十多项建议和技术措施。现在，经过同基本建设单位商量，已经削减六项工程，降低了十一项工程的设计标准，修改了三十项工程的设计，再加上其他一些零星项目的节约，共可为国家节省三百多万元建设资金。如决定今年施工的农牧学校，原来设计的是三层楼房，教室、办公室、宿舍等都在一起，教学不方便，投资数量很大，现在已经决定改成砖木和土木结构的平房和一部分砖木结构的二层楼房。这样，建筑既适用，又经济，平均每平方公尺造价比原来降低一半，共节约投资五十万元。
    目前，新疆军区生产建设部队的设计部门和各个施工单位，还在深入研究制定进一步的节约方案，争取为国家节约更多的建设资金。
