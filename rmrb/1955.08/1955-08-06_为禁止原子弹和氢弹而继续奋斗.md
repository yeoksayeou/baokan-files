    The World Conference for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs will be held in Hiroshima, Japan today. The conference will discuss the dangers of atomic and hydrogen bombs and the necessity of international cooperation in the struggle to destroy these weapons. At the same time, the conference will also discuss issues such as demanding the prohibition of such weapons, opposing the threat of new wars, and defending peace. This is another major effort by the Japanese people and all peace-loving people around the world to unite, oppose the threat of atomic war, and safeguard world peace. It demonstrates the unwavering common will of the people of the world in this regard. The World Peace Council’s call on August 2 stated: “Let us turn August 6, 1955, into a great international day of struggle! Form a powerful force to demand disarmament and the destruction of atomic weapons!” This is a great call, it is the voice of all peace-loving people.
  The Chinese people have always advocated the prohibition of atomic weapons and weapons of mass destruction. We deeply sympathize with the Japanese people who have suffered from the disasters of American atomic bomb bombings and hydrogen bomb tests. We warmly support the World Conference for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held in Hiroshima, Japan today. The Chinese people have also, at the invitation of Japanese people's organizations, sent their own representatives to participate in this conference. On the eve of the World Conference, a meeting of people from all walks of life in the Chinese capital was held in Beijing to oppose atomic weapons. This is a manifestation of our people's enthusiastic response to the call of the World Peace Council, resolutely opposing atomic weapons and the threat of atomic war, and it is also full support for the Japanese people's struggle against turning Japan into a foreign atomic war base.
    The convening of the World Conference for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs was initiated by the National Conference of the Japanese People for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Weapons held in Tokyo on January 16 this year. The resolution of the National Conference stated: "We express our anger at certain forces in the world who unhesitatingly declare their readiness to use atomic weapons. In order to consolidate our movement to eliminate war, let us decide to invite leaders from governments and other sectors of all countries in the world to participate in the conference on the prohibition of atomic weapons." Since then, the Japanese people have actively launched preparatory work, raised funds, and welcomed this world gathering. The preparatory committee of the World Conference included prominent representatives of various Japanese political parties and received enthusiastic support from more than one hundred mass organizations such as the National Council for the Signature Campaign for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in Japan.
    The just action of the Japanese people in initiating this World Conference has aroused widespread sympathy and support among the people of the world. The Asian Countries Conference held in April and the World Peace Conference held in June both passed resolutions calling on the people of Asia and the world to participate in this movement and resolutely demand the prohibition of atomic weapons and weapons of mass destruction. People from many countries have sent their representatives to attend the World Conference for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. This shows that the conference is fully representative and that the people of all countries, in the practical struggle for peace, have deeply realized that the forces of the people of all countries must be brought together to act jointly for the prohibition of atomic weapons and the elimination of the threat of new wars.
    It is of special significance that the World Conference for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs is being held in Hiroshima, Japan. Japan is the first, and the only country to have suffered from the disasters of atomic and hydrogen weapons three times. In Japan, thousands of atomic bomb victims are still permanently disabled. Because the Japanese people have suffered from the disasters of atomic and hydrogen bombs, their will to demand the prohibition of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons and to oppose the threat of atomic war is particularly strong. Throughout the post-war period, people from all walks of life in Japan have been fighting heroically for the prohibition of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons. The powerful movement to protest against the testing of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons and to demand the prohibition of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons has been developing on a large scale among the people of Japan. The most recent signature campaign in Japan demanding the prohibition of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs has now been signed by more than 31 million people. The Japanese people have waged an unyielding struggle against the United States' attempt to turn Japan into a US atomic war base. Due to the powerful movement of the Japanese people, even both houses of the Japanese Diet have declared their support for the prohibition of atomic weapons. The people of the world are clearly aware that the atomic arms race is one of the important roots of post-war international unrest and increased danger of new wars. In order to ease world tensions and eliminate the threat of new wars, it is necessary to prohibit atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons and to make atomic energy serve peace and human welfare completely. The universal desire of the people of the world to prohibit atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons has been demonstrated in the large-scale signature campaign launched in response to the World Peace Council. This movement is still developing in many countries around the world.
    In the wake of the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference, the relaxation of international tensions has prepared favorable conditions for reaching international agreements on the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons and the elimination of the threat of new wars. The Soviet Union, which has mastered the world's most advanced atomic energy science and technology, has consistently worked to prohibit atomic and hydrogen weapons and to develop the peaceful uses of atomic energy. At the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference, the Soviet Union once again put forward new, practical and feasible proposals for reducing armaments, prohibiting atomic and hydrogen weapons, and eliminating the threat of new wars. The Four-Power Summit Conference, in a spirit of cooperation, also gave joint instructions to the forthcoming Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, asking the Foreign Ministers Conference to consider the opinions and suggestions put forward by the heads of government. US President Eisenhower also repeatedly expressed before, during, and after the Four-Power Summit Conference that the United States is willing to see a peaceful future for the world. As long as the Western countries that have mastered atomic energy have the same sincere desire to promote peace as the Soviet Union, it is entirely possible to prohibit atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, eliminate the threat of new wars, and jointly cooperate to develop the peaceful uses of atomic energy.
    Under these circumstances, the stepped-up pace of propaganda and actual preparations for atomic war in the United States, immediately following the Four-Power Summit Conference, seems particularly discordant and far removed from the demands of the people. Recently, the United States also specially deployed atomic weapons troops to the Far East. It also transported atomic rocket launchers to Japan in an attempt to turn Japan into a US atomic military base. At the same time, despite the opposition of the Japanese people and some Japanese political parties and other well-known figures from all walks of life, the Japanese government has actually allowed Japan to be turned into a US atomic military base. On the other hand, the Japanese government has obstructed and restricted the participation of representatives from China and other countries in the World Conference for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. This is certainly inconsistent with the Japanese government's professed support for the conference. The Chinese people cannot but feel regret about this.
    The Four-Power Summit Conference has helped to ease international tensions, but weapons of mass destruction, atomic and hydrogen weapons, are still being produced and stockpiled in large quantities, and the threat of atomic war has not been eliminated. Therefore, the World Conference for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, which begins in Hiroshima today, is very timely. It will help to further ease international tensions. It will declare to the world the common will of the people of all countries: to make persistent efforts and continue to fight for the prohibition of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons.

### 为禁止原子弹和氢弹而继续奋斗

    为禁止原子弹和氢弹而继续奋斗
    今天将在日本广岛举行禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会。大会将讨论原子弹和氢弹的危险和在争取销毁这些武器的斗争中实行国际合作的必要性。同时，大会还将讨论要求禁止这类武器、反对新战争威胁、保卫和平等问题。这是日本人民和全世界爱好和平人民团结一致，反对原子战争威胁，保卫世界和平的又一个重大努力。它显示着全世界人民在这方面的坚定不移的共同意志。世界和平理事会八月二日发表的号召书中说：“让我们把一九五五年八月六日变为一个伟大的国际斗争日！结成强大的队伍一致要求裁军和销毁原子武器！”这是伟大的号召，这是一切爱好和平人民的声音。
  中国人民一向主张禁止原子武器和大规模毁灭性武器。我们对于遭受美国原子弹轰炸和氢弹试验的灾难的日本人民深表同情。我们热烈地支持今天在日本广岛举行的禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会。中国人民并已应日本各人民团体的邀请，派遣了自己的代表参加这个大会。在世界大会的前夕，在北京举行了中国首都各界人民反对原子武器大会。这是我国人民热烈响应世界和平大会的号召，坚决反对原子武器，反对原子战争威胁的意志的表现，也是对于日本人民反对把日本变成外国原子战争基地的斗争的全力的支持。
    禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会的召开，是由今年一月十六日在东京举行的日本人民要求禁止原子武器和氢武器全国大会发起的。全国大会的决议说：“我们对世界上某些势力表示我们的愤怒，这些势力毫不踌躇地宣布他们准备使用原子武器。为了巩固我们的运动以消灭战争，让我们决定邀请全世界各国政府和其他各界的领袖人物来参加禁止原子武器的大会。”从那时起，日本人民便积极展开筹备工作，募集基金，迎接这个世界性的集会。世界大会的筹备会中包括日本各政党的著名代表人物，并得到日本禁止原子弹和氢弹签名运动全国协议会等一百多个群众组织的热烈支持。
    日本人民发起举行这个世界大会的正义行动，在全世界人民中引起了广泛的同情和支援。今年四月间举行的亚洲国家会议和六月间举行的世界和平大会，都曾通过决议，号召亚洲和世界人民参加这个运动，坚决要求禁止原子武器和大规模毁灭性武器。许多国家的人民派遣自己的代表出席禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会。这说明这个大会具有充分的代表性，说明各国人民在争取和平的实际斗争中，已经深刻地认识到，必须把各国人民的力量汇集起来，为禁止原子武器、消除新战争威胁而共同行动。
    禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会在日本广岛举行，是具有特殊的意义的。日本是第一个，而且是曾经三次遭到原子武器和氢武器灾害的国家。在日本，至今还有数以千计的原子弹受害者成为终身残废。正因为日本人民经受了原子弹和氢弹的灾害，他们要求禁止原子武器和氢武器、反对原子战争威胁的意志表现得特别强烈。在整个战后期间，日本各阶层人民一直在为禁止原子武器和氢武器而英勇斗争。抗议试验原子武器和氢武器和要求禁止原子武器和氢武器的强大运动，一直在日本全国人民中大规模地发展着。最近一次在日本展开的要求禁止原子弹和氢弹的签名运动，到现在已经有三千一百多万人签了名。日本人民为反对美国把日本变成美国的原子战争基地，进行了不屈不挠的斗争。由于日本人民的强大运动，连日本国会参众两院也声明赞成禁止原子武器。全世界人民都清楚地看到，原子军备竞赛是造成战后国际不安和增加新战争危险的重要根源之一。为了缓和世界紧张局势，消除新的战争威胁，必须禁止原子武器和氢武器，使原子能完全为和平和人类福利服务。全世界人民要求禁止原子武器和氢武器的普遍愿望，在响应世界和平理事会所发动的规模巨大的签名运动中已经表现出来了。这个运动还正在世界许多国家继续发展着。
    在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议后，国际紧张局势的和缓，已为就禁止原子武器和氢武器，消除新战争威胁问题达成国际协议，准备了有利的条件。掌握了世界最先进的原子能科学和技术的苏联始终如一地为禁止原子武器和氢武器和发展原子能的和平用途而努力。苏联在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议上又一次提出了裁减军备，禁止原子武器和氢武器，消除新战争威胁的新的切实可行的建议。四国政府首脑会议并曾本着合作的精神，对将要举行的四国外长会议作出共同指示，要外长会议考虑政府首脑们提出的意见和建议。美国总统艾森豪威尔在四国政府首脑会议前，会上和会后，也曾经一再表示美国愿意看到世界的和平前途。只要掌握了原子能的西方国家都同苏联一样，具有促进和平的真诚愿望，那末禁止原子武器和氢武器，消除新战争威胁，共同合作发展原子能的和平用途是完全可能的。
    在这种情况之下，紧跟在四国政府首脑会议之后，美国国内关于原子战争的宣传和实际准备的加紧进行，就特别显得气氛不协调，显得同人民的要求有很大的距离。最近美国还特地把原子武器部队开到远东来。它还把原子火箭发射器运到日本，企图把日本变成美国的原子军事基地。同时，尽管日本人民和日本的一些政党以及其他各界的知名人士都表示反对，日本政府却竟然容许把日本变成美国的原子军事基地。另一方面，日本政府却又对中国和其他国家参加禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会的代表进行阻难和限制。这同日本政府对大会表示的支持态度当然是不相符合的。中国人民对此不能不感到遗憾。
    四国政府首脑会议有助于国际局势的缓和，但大规模毁灭性的原子武器和氢武器还在被大量制造和储存起来，原子战争的威胁还没有消除。因此，今天在广岛开始举行的禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会，是非常适时的。它将有助于使国际紧张局势进一步趋于缓和。它将向全世界宣告各国人民的共同意志：再接再厉，为禁止原子武器和氢武器而继续奋斗。
