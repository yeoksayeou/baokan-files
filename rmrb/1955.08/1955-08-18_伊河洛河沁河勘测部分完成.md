A portion of the data needed for the main basin planning of the Yi River, Luo River, and Qin River – major tributaries of the Yellow River from Sanmenxia to Qinchang – has been collected. During April and May this year, two basin survey teams, two geological drilling teams, two topographic surveying teams, and several hydrological survey groups from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, along with Team 941 of the Ministry of Geology and the Forestry Survey Team of the Henan Provincial Forestry Bureau, went to these three rivers to conduct surveys. They have now completed work on river channel conditions, hydrological surveys, socio-economic surveys, and comprehensive reconnaissance of hydrogeology. Thirteen dam sites suitable for reservoir construction have been identified, and topographic surveys of the reservoir dam sites have been completed. At present, regional economic surveys, forestry distribution, soil and water conservation and irrigation area surveys, geological surveys, and geological drilling work throughout the entire basin are being actively carried out to further understand the data related to the development of these three tributaries and to create comparative plans for the thirteen reservoir dam sites.

According to estimates by the Yellow River Planning Commission, because the Sanmenxia Reservoir cannot control the floods of the Yi River, Luo River, and Qin River downstream of the reservoir after its completion, the floods of these three rivers may still pose a threat to the downstream areas. To eliminate this threat, the first phase of the Yellow River management and development project stipulates that several reservoirs should be built on the Yi River, Luo River, and Qin River to contain the floods. The current survey work on these three tributaries is being carried out to prepare tributary basin plans and determine tributary development plans. (Xinhua News Agency)

    伊河洛河沁河勘测部分完成
    黄河从三门峡到秦厂一段的主要支流——伊河、洛河和沁河主要流域规划所需的一部分资料已经搜集完成。今年四、五月间，黄河水利委员会的两个流域查勘队、两个地质钻探队、两个地形测量队、几个水文调查组和地质部九四一队、河南省林业局林业调查队等勘测队伍曾陆续到这三条河流上进行勘测。现在已完成了河道形势、水文调查、社会经济调查和水利地质综合踏勘等工作，找出十三处可建水库的坝址，并完成了水库坝址的地形测量。现在，整个流域的区域经济调查、林业分布、水土保持和灌区查勘、地质调查、地质钻探工作，现在正积极进行，以便进一步了解这三条支流有关开发的资料，并作出十三处水库坝址的比较方案来。
    据黄河规划委员会推算，由于三门峡水库建成后无法控制水库以下伊河、洛河、沁河的洪水，这三条河的洪水仍可能对下游造成威胁。为解除这一威胁，治理和开发黄河第一期工程中规定：要在伊河、洛河和沁河上修建几座水库，拦蓄洪水。现在这三条支流的勘测工作就是为编制支流流域规划、确定支流的开发计划而进行的。（新华社）
