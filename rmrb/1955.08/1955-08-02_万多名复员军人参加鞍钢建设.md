More than 10,000 demobilized soldiers have joined the construction of Ansteel.

Among these demobilized construction soldiers are factory directors, foremen, and workers of all trades. They maintain the fine traditions of revolutionary soldiers and have made great contributions to the construction of the steel capital. From 1952 to the present, more than 540 of them have been recognized as models for demobilized construction soldiers or revolutionary disabled soldiers in Anshan City, and many are labor models and advanced producers in the city or in various factories and construction sites. Du Mingyuan, a revolutionary disabled soldier, joined the construction of the three major projects of Ansteel shortly after being demobilized to Anshan and was selected as an advanced producer. In the past three years, he has also been continuously selected as a model revolutionary disabled soldier in Anshan City. One day in May of this year, the drainage ditch of the No. 4 open-hearth furnace in the steelmaking plant was blocked, and the hot water flowing down from the open-hearth furnace accumulated higher and higher. If the molten steel touched the water, there was a danger of explosion. Liu Chunyi, a worker at the water supply plant and a demobilized construction soldier, immediately jumped into the waist-deep hot water to clear the ditch, regardless of everything. Although his injured right leg was in severe pain in the hot water, he still insisted on clearing the drainage ditch. Zhao Yuting, deputy director of the coal storage yard construction site and a demobilized construction soldier, diligently studied his profession and put forward many rationalization proposals. Last year, he put forward a proposal to save materials, saving the country 40,000 yuan. In July of this year, he put forward a proposal for civilized construction, which saved more than 300 man-days after implementation. When building the seamless steel pipe plant, Zhao Yuting and special-class labor model Wang Jinzhong jointly led the model concrete team, implementing the assembly line method and continuously creating new records in bulldozing and excavation.

    万多名复员军人参加鞍钢建设
    参加鞍钢生产建设工作的复员建设军人已有一万多名。
    这些复员建设军人中，有厂长、工长和各工种的工人。他们保持着革命军人的优良传统，在钢都建设事业中作了很大的贡献。从一九五二年到现在，他们有五百四十多人被评为鞍山市的复员建设军人模范或革命残废军人模范，不少人都是全市或各工厂、工地的劳动模范和先进生产者。革命残废军人杜明远复员到鞍山不久，就参加了鞍钢三大工程的建设，并被评选为先进生产者。最近三年中，他还连续被选为鞍山市革命残废军人模范。今年五月有一天，炼钢厂四号平炉的排水沟堵住了，从平炉上流下来的热水越积越高，钢水碰到水就有发生爆炸的危险。给水厂工人、复员建设军人刘春义一看到这个情况，立刻不顾一切地跳到没腰深的热水中去疏通水沟，虽然他那条受过伤的右腿在热水中疼的厉害，但他还是坚持把排水沟疏通了。贮煤厂工地副主任、复员建设军人赵玉亭认真钻研业务，提出许多合理化建议。去年他提出一项节约器材的建议，为国家节约了四万元的财富。今年七月间他又提出文明施工的建议，执行后节约了三百多个人工。赵玉亭在建设无缝钢管厂时，曾和特等劳动模范王进忠共同领导模范混凝土队，实行流水作业法，连续创造了推土、挖土的新纪录。
