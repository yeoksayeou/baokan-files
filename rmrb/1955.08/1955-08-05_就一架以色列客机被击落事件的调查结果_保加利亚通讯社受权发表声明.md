Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, August 4th: According to TASS, Sofia newspapers published a statement from the Bulgarian News Agency on the 3rd. The statement said that the Bulgarian News Agency, authorized by the government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, issued a statement based on the facts listed in the final investigation report of the government's special committee tasked with investigating the unfortunate incident of the Israeli passenger plane in Bulgarian airspace.

The statement said: An "El Al" airline four-engine Constellation passenger plane left its own route on July 27 this year, and entered Bulgarian airspace without any prior notice. Then, the plane disobeyed warning signals ordering it to land and continued to fly south towards the Bulgarian-Greek border.

The Bulgarian air defense organs acted too hastily and did not take the necessary measures to force the plane to land. Seeing that the invading plane was trying to escape across the border, the Bulgarian fighter planes opened fire on it, resulting in the plane catching fire and crashing in the Petrich area. All fifty-one passengers and seven crew members on board died.

The statement pointed out that in the past few years, "unidentified" aircraft have constantly crossed the Bulgarian border to engage in illegal flights, and have airdropped saboteurs carrying weapons, radio transmitters, and other equipment into Bulgarian territory. The Bulgarian government has repeatedly protested to the United Nations Secretariat, but to no effect. All this has led to a tense situation in which measures must be taken to safeguard our country's security. It was in this tense situation that the Israeli plane incident could have occurred.

The statement said: The Bulgarian government and the Bulgarian people once again express their deep regret for this incident and the deaths of innocent people. The Bulgarian government sincerely hopes that such incidents will not happen again, and on its part, will find and punish those responsible for this unfortunate incident, and take all measures to ensure that such incidents never happen again on our territory. However, the Bulgarian government believes that this can only be achieved if the independence, sovereignty, and national dignity of all countries, large and small, are fully respected.

The Bulgarian government deeply sympathizes with the relatives of those who died in this unfortunate incident, and has expressed its willingness in a note to the Israeli government to pay compensation to the families of the victims and share in the compensation for material losses.

    就一架以色列客机被击落事件的调查结果
    保加利亚通讯社受权发表声明
    新华社四日讯　据塔斯社索非亚讯：索非亚各报三日刊载了保加利亚通讯社的一项声明。声明说，保加利亚通讯社在保加利亚人民共和国政府授权下，根据奉命调查在保加利亚领空发生的以色列客机不幸事件的政府特别委员会的最后调查书中列举的事实发表声明。
    声明说：以色列“埃尔埃尔”航空公司的一架四引擎星座式客机在今年七月二十七日离开了自己的航线，没有作任何预先通知就侵入保加利亚的领空。接着，这架飞机又不服从命令它降落的警告信号，继续朝南向保加利亚—希腊边境飞行。
    保加利亚防空机关过于性急，没有采取必要的措施来强迫飞机降落。保加利亚战斗机眼看这架入侵的飞机企图越境逃去，于是就对它开火，结果这架飞机着火坠落在彼得里士地区。飞机上的五十一名旅客和七名机务人员全部死亡。
    声明指出，过去几年中，不断有“国籍不明”的飞机越过保加利亚边境从事非法飞行，而且把携带武器、无线电发报机和其他器材的破坏分子空投到保加利亚领土上。而保加利亚政府多次向联合国秘书处提出抗议都没有产生效果。这一切引起了一种必需采取措施来保障我国安全的紧张局势。就是在这种紧张局势中，以色列飞机事件才有可能发生。
    声明说：保加利亚政府和保加利亚人民再度对这次事件和无辜人民的死亡表示深切的遗憾。保加利亚政府热诚希望这种事件不再发生，并且在自己方面将找出和惩办那些对这次不幸事件应负责任的人，并且采取一切措施，以使这种事件永远不再在我国境内发生。但是，保加利亚政府认为，只有在大小的国家的独立、主权和民族尊严受到完全尊重的情况下才能做到这一点。
    保加利亚政府深为同情在这次不幸事件中遇难的人们的亲属，并且在致以色列政府的照会中表明愿意向死难者家属付出赔偿，并分担物质损失的赔偿。
