    Fourth Quaternary Glacial Striations Discovered in the Suburbs of Beijing
    When the Model Kou Engineering Geology Team of the Hydrogeology and Engineering Geology Bureau of the Ministry of Geology conducted geological surveys in 1954, they discovered Quaternary glacial striations on the smooth surface of diabase in the Model Kou area of ​​suburban Beijing. The discovered striations are not only clearly marked but also concentrated in large areas, providing invaluable data for the study of the Quaternary glaciers. The Ministry of Geology has now agreed with the Beijing Municipal People's Committee to establish boundaries for preservation for geologists and other scientists to study.
    According to records in Chinese Geology, glacial striations on bedrock surfaces were first discovered in two locations: on the granite of Huangshan Mountain in Anhui and on the Carboniferous Huanglong limestone in the Toad Stone of Baishizui under Lushan Mountain in Jiangxi. There are no records of glacial striations on bedrock north of the Yangtze River Basin. The Quaternary glaciers are a component of the Quaternary geology, and the study of the Quaternary glaciers is important for understanding the Quaternary paleoclimate of China and for engineering geological and hydrogeological applications in China's large-scale economic construction. The discovery of glacial striations on bedrock in the Model Kou area is of great significance to the study of groundwater and various sand and gravel deposits in both scientific research and economic construction.

    北京郊区发现第四纪冰川擦痕
    地质部水文地质工程地质局模式口工程地质队，在一九五四年进行地质勘察工作时，曾在北京郊区模式口地区辉绿岩的光滑面上，发现第四纪冰川擦痕。发现的擦痕不仅刻痕清晰，而且集中成为大片，为研究第四纪冰川不可多得的资料。现地质部已和北京市人民委员会商定立界保存，以供地质学家及其他科学家研究。
    根据中国地质学所载，基岩面上的冰川擦痕，最早曾在安徽黄山花岗岩上及江西庐山下白石嘴蛤蟆石中石炭纪黄龙灰岩上两处发现过，在长江流域以北尚未见有基岩上冰川擦痕的记载。第四纪冰川为第四纪地质组成部分，研究第四纪冰川，对于了解我国第四纪古气候，以及我国在大规模经济建设中，关于工程地质水文地质方面的应用都很重要。模式口地区的基岩上的冰川擦痕的发现，无论在科学研究和经济建设中对地下水及各种砂碛矿等的研究，都具有重要的意义。
