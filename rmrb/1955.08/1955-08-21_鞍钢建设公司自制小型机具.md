Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company Self-Makes Small Machines and Tools

　　Since the beginning of this year, the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company has self-made a total of 20 types and 59 units of small construction machinery and tools, further mechanizing the construction process.

　　The small construction machinery and tools self-made by the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company have a wide range of applications. These include skip hoists, various sizes of belt conveyors, and motorcycle tractors used for horizontal transportation, as well as vibrating receiving platforms, mortar conveying pumps, and automatic oiling machines used in concrete, plastering, and painting projects. They all have the characteristics of high efficiency, low cost, and simple construction. For example, using a mortar pump for plastering can directly spray the mortar onto the wall, and can plaster 500 square meters per shift, which is equivalent to ten times the efficiency of manual plastering. The manufacturing cost of the vibrating receiving platform is only a little over 1,000 yuan. When used, it not only improves the quality of concrete and increases the pouring speed by twice that of manual labor, but also reduces five workers per shift.

　　In the second half of this year, the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company will continue to produce 14 new types of small machines and tools.

　　鞍钢建设公司自制小型机具
    鞍山钢铁建设公司从今年年初以来，已经自制小型施工机械器具共二十种，五十九台，使施工过程进一步机械化。
    鞍山钢铁建设公司自制的小型施工机具，应用范围很广。其中有使用于水平运输的吊斗卷扬机、各种不同尺寸的皮带输送机、摩托牵引车，也有在混凝土、抹灰、油漆工程中使用的震动受料台、灰浆输送泵、自动刷油器等。它们都具有效率高、成本低、构造简单等特点。如使用灰浆泵抹灰，可以把灰浆直接喷射在墙上，每班可以抹灰五百平方公尺，相当于人工抹灰效率的十倍。震动受料台制造成本只要一千多元，使用起来，不但能提高混凝土质量，使浇灌速度比人工提高一倍，而且能使每班减少五名工人。
    今年下半年内，鞍山钢铁建设公司将继续新制十四种小型机具。
