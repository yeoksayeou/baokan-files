　　Baga, a Model of Hygiene on the Grassland
　　By our reporter Lin Mo
    During an interview on the Inner Mongolian grasslands, many herdsmen described their past lives to me: they lived in dirty, broken yurts; the stoves had no chimneys, and the yurts were often filled with choking smoke; they slept on damp ground covered with broken hides or rotten felt; and they wore greasy sheepskin robes. At that time, there was no talk of cleanliness or hygiene, and almost every family had sick people. The sound of shamans dancing and wildly beating drums could often be heard on the grasslands; livestock and babies died and were thrown away everywhere… This was the tragic scene of the lives of herdsmen in the old society.
    Such things have become historical relics. Today, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the herdsmen on the Inner Mongolian grasslands have been living in a completely different era for only a few years.
    In Haton Hu Shuo Baga [Note] of Chen Barag Banner, I visited the home of herdsman Solon Battelle. This is a new family with neat furnishings, a love of cleanliness, and a happy life. The owner led me into the yurt, and a little boy ran up to shake hands with me and say hello. This warm and polite child was just four years old, healthy and lively, with a red and plump face, wearing a half-new green cloth gown with floral patterns, and small sheepskin boots embroidered with lace.
    I carefully looked at the furnishings of this family. The yurt was surrounded by floral cloth curtains; three beds were placed on three sides, covered with blankets and floral sheets, and the quilts were neatly folded; an iron stove with a chimney was placed in the middle; and portraits of Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Zhu, and Soviet leaders were hung on the front. The four-year-old Dadesher could name the leaders of China and the Soviet Union one by one. Sunlight shone in from the skylight, and the yurt was bright and spacious. The hostess sat peacefully on the bed doing needlework.
    A utensil rack covered with white cloth caught my attention. With the owner's permission, I lifted the white cloth cover and saw a row of fine porcelain bowls on the top layer, and several thin iron buckets for tea, water, and milking, and a white enamel bucket on the bottom layer. These things were all scrubbed and polished, and the rice bowls were placed upside down to prevent dust from falling in. The owner told me that according to the old rules of the old society, the rice bowls were not washed; people said that washing the bowls would wash away "good fortune." But these old rules have been replaced by new rules. The owner pointed out to me that their kitchen knife, rolling pin, and chopping board each had a cloth cover, which they put on after use. This method is very suitable for their nomadic life. I touched the inside and outside of the utensil rack with my fingers, and I didn't see any dust. The wooden board on which the bowls were placed was washed so often that it showed smooth silk grains, as if it had been sanded with sandpaper. The few movable floorboards laid on the ground in front of the bed were also washed equally clean. Obviously, the owner of this family has developed a habit of loving cleanliness.
    At first, I thought this was just an outstanding example of an individual family, but when I went to many places, I realized that the herdsmen here have generally become hygienic.
    Changing the old habits that people have developed for thousands of years requires in-depth publicity and education work.
    After liberation, the People's Government sent a Mongolian doctor named Baoyin Dala to Haton Hu Shuo Baga in Chen Barag Banner to treat herdsmen. This was in 1949. At that time, he counted that out of the forty-one people in one residential group, there were twenty-nine patients. He knew that if he only cured these patients in front of him and did not try to improve sanitation and eliminate the root causes of diseases, the suffering of the herdsmen would never be relieved. He treated the patients on the one hand, and explained hygiene knowledge to the herdsmen on the other hand. After several months of work, many herdsmen personally realized that he was doing good things for them. The herdsmen Solon Battelle, Sidebu and others deeply believed in his words. They first mobilized their families to implement improved hygiene methods, and publicized them to the masses everywhere.
    Solon Battelle and Sidebu's publicity to the masses on hygiene initially encountered opposition from many people. Some elderly people said, "It has been like this since ancient times. We have lived our whole lives. What's wrong with it?" Some said, "Washing clothes often costs cloth. If you do this, you will be committing a sin!"
    They felt that general publicity alone would not work, so they made several "hygiene model" signs. Whenever they found that a family had made some improvements, they would hang the model sign on the door and mobilize everyone to visit. They understood that the herdsmen had a strong sense of honor. If everyone said he was good, he would definitely do better. People who visited went to Sidebu's home. Sidebu's mother said that it was really not good to use fire tongs to pick up meat from the pot. As she spoke, she took out a pair of wooden chopsticks for everyone to see. People said: It doesn't take much effort to make this thing, but it is much cleaner than using fire tongs. Everyone went to Seyin Hu's house and saw that the bowls in his house were washed clean and placed face down on a wooden board, covered with cloth, unlike other families who put the bowls on the ground with a layer of dust inside. But Seyin Hu's mother said that her family hadn't done well enough. For example, the water bucket and teapot were placed on the ground, with a layer of dust on the bottom. When they were picked up, they were inserted into the water tank to draw water. How could it not be dirty? It would be better to make some kind of rack to put these things on. These words immediately reminded Solon Battelle. Solon Battelle was originally a carpenter, so he made a movable utensil rack based on everyone's opinions. This thing only needs a few pieces of wood and a few boards. When the herdsmen move, they can disassemble it and put it on the cart; when they arrive at the place, they install it in the yurt and put a cloth cover on the outside, and put the pots, bowls, ladles, and spoons inside. No dust falls in, and no flies can fly in. This kind of wooden frame has now been widely promoted among the herdsmen in the whole banner.
    At that time, they demonstrated and promoted while absorbing the opinions of the masses. In less than a year, under the guidance of medical personnel, they researched and developed more than 70 ways to improve hygiene work. Later, the Baga also elected a health committee member and established a health committee. The health committee member regularly went to each household to publicize, supervise, and inspect the more than 70 methods that everyone had researched and stipulated.
    At first, some people still had a perfunctory attitude towards hygiene. At that time, even Solon Battelle's wife, Yan Cai, was like this. In order to obtain the honor of being a hygiene model, she cleaned her home spotlessly during hygiene inspections, but she was sloppy after the inspection. As time went on, she thought: What does it matter to the inspectors whether I am clean or not? Being hygienic and keeping the whole family from getting sick is good for me! After that, whether there was an inspection or not, she paid attention to hygiene as usual. Over time, she slowly developed a habit. When the family is neat and clean, she feels comfortable in her heart. If she sees something unclean, she feels uneasy in her heart even when she sits down to work.
    Family by family, they slowly developed the habit of loving cleanliness. In less than two years, the hygiene situation in the whole Baga had been significantly improved. When people nearby came here to visit relatives, they saw a big change as soon as they entered the yurt: the bedding was neatly folded on the bed, the pots, bowls, ladles, and spoons were scrubbed and polished, and whether adults or children, their hands and faces were washed clean, and everyone looked particularly energetic, and the number of patients was also greatly reduced. A woman named Pi Liema brought the methods of carrying out hygiene work in Haton Hu Shuo Baga back to promote when she went to her parents' home here. Later, they also became one of the hygiene model Baga in the whole banner.
    In recent years, the hygiene model deeds of Haton Hu Shuo Baga have been praised by the higher-level People's Government every year, and the atmosphere of loving cleanliness and paying attention to hygiene among the people in the Baga has spread on the grasslands.

### 草原上的卫生模范巴嘎

　　草原上的卫生模范巴嘎
　　本报记者　林沫
    在内蒙古草原上采访的时候，许多牧民向我描述他们过去的生活：住的是污黑破烂的蒙古包，炉灶没有烟囱，包里经常弥漫着呛人的烟雾；睡的是在潮湿的地下铺上块破皮子或烂毡子；穿的是一身油腻的羊皮袄。那时根本谈不到什么清洁卫生，几乎每家都有病人，草原上常常听到巫医跳大神狂敲乱打的鼓声；牲畜和婴儿死了到处乱扔……这就是旧社会牧民生活的悲惨景象。
    这样的事情，已成为历史陈迹了。如今，内蒙古草原上的牧民在中国共产党的领导下，不过几年的时间，已经生活在另一个截然不同的时代。
    在陈巴尔虎旗的哈顿胡硕巴嘎〔注〕，有一次我到牧民索伦巴特尔家里。这是一个陈设整齐、爱好清洁、生活快乐的新家庭。主人领着我走进蒙古包，一个小男孩就跑上来同我握手问好。这个对人亲热、懂得礼貌的孩子刚满四岁，健康活泼，脸又红又胖，穿着半新的绿布花袍子，脚上的小羊皮靴还绣着花边。
    我仔细看了这个家庭的陈设。蒙古包里四周围着花布幔；三面放着三张床，床上铺着毛毯子、花单子，被子叠得整整齐齐；中间放着安有烟囱的铁炉子；正面挂着毛主席、朱副主席和苏联领袖像。四岁的小达德尔舍能够一一说出中、苏两国人民领袖的名字。阳光由天窗上射进来，包里亮堂堂的，女主人安详地坐在床上做活计。
    一个用白布罩着的食具架引起了我的注意。我经主人允许撩起那洁白的布罩子，见上面一层放着一排细瓷碗，下面放着几个盛茶、打水、挤奶用的薄铁桶和一个白色搪瓷桶。这些东西都擦洗得明光发亮，饭碗都倒扣着，免得落进灰尘。主人告诉我，按旧社会的老规矩，饭碗是不洗的；人们说，洗碗会把“口福”洗掉。而这些老规矩已被新规矩代替了。主人指给我看，他们的菜刀、捍面杖、案板，每样都做有一个布套子，用后就把它装起来。这办法很适合于他们的游牧生活。我用手指在食具架里外到处摸了，也不见染有灰尘。那放碗的木板，由于经常洗刷，显露出光滑的丝纹，就像用砂纸打磨过一样。在床前地下铺的几块活动地板，也洗刷得同样干净。显然，这家的主人已经养成了爱好清洁的习惯。
    起初，我以为这不过是个别家庭的突出事例，当我走过很多地方，我才了解到这里牧民已普遍地讲卫生了。
    改变人们千百年以来所养成的旧习惯，是需要深入地进行宣传教育工作的。
    解放以后，人民政府派了一个名叫宝音达来的蒙族医生，到陈巴尔虎旗的哈顿胡硕巴嘎给牧民治病。这是一九四九年的事了。当时他统计，在一个居民组的四十一个人中，就有二十九个病人。他知道，如果只把眼前的这些病人治好，而不想法改进卫生工作，消除疾病的根源，牧民的痛苦是永远无法解除的。他就一面治病，一面向牧民讲解卫生知识。经过几个月的工作，许多牧民亲身体会到他是给自己办好事的。牧民索伦巴特尔、斯德布等深深相信了他的话，他们首先动员自己家里的人实行改进卫生的办法，并到处向群众宣传。
    索伦巴特尔同斯德布向群众宣传讲卫生，开始曾遭到不少人的反对。有的老年人说：“自古以来就是这样，我们活了一辈子了，有什么不好？”有的说：“衣服常洗要费布，你们这么干，要作孽造罪呀！”
    他们感到光这样一般宣传不行，于是就作了几个“卫生模范”牌子，发现那家有一点改进，就把模范牌子给挂在门口，并发动大家去参观。他们懂得，牧民的荣誉心都很强，如果大家说他好，他就一定要做得更好。参观的人到斯德布家。斯德布的母亲说，用火剪子从锅里夹肉吃，实在不好，说着，她就拿出一双木筷子给大家看。人们说：做这东西不费事，可比用火剪子干净多了。大家到色音虎家，见他家的碗都洗得干干净净，口朝下放在一块木板上，上面还用布盖着，不像别家那样把碗放在地下，碗里边落一层灰土。但色音虎的母亲说，她家做得还不够好，譬如水桶、茶壶都放在地下，底子上沾一层灰土，拿起来就插到水缸里盛水，怎么不脏呢？要弄个什么架架，把这东西放在上边才好。这话一下提醒了索伦巴特尔。索伦巴特尔原是个木匠，他就根据大家的意见，制作出了一种活动的食具架。这东西只需几根木头和几块板。牧民要搬家时，可以把它拆开放在车上；到地方就在蒙古包里安装起来，外边套上个布罩子，把锅碗瓢勺放在里边。落不了灰土，也飞不进苍蝇。这种木架现已在全旗的牧民中到处推广起来了。
    当时，他们就这样一边示范推广，一边吸收群众的意见，不到一年的功夫，就在医务人员的指导下，研究出了七十多条改进卫生工作的办法。后来，巴嘎里又选了卫生委员，成立了卫生委员会。卫生委员根据大家研究规定出七十多条办法，经常到各家宣传、督促和检查。
    起初，有些人对讲卫生还抱着应付的态度。那时，连索伦巴特尔的妻子燕彩也是这样。她为了得到卫生模范的光荣，在检查卫生时把家里收拾得干干净净，但等检查过后就马虎了。时间长了，她就想：自己清洁不清洁，同检查的人有什么关系呢？讲卫生，一家老小不生病，是对自己有好处呵！以后，不论检查不检查，她都照样注意卫生，天长日久，就慢慢养成了习惯。家里整齐清洁了，心里就舒舒展展的，要看到什么地方不干净，坐下来做活心里都不安然。
    一家家就这么慢慢养成了爱好清洁的习惯，不两年功夫，全巴嘎的卫生情况就有了显著改进。附近的人到这里串亲戚，一走进蒙古包，就见大变了样：床上被褥叠得整整齐齐，锅碗瓢勺擦洗得明光发亮，不论大人小孩，手脸都洗得干干净净，个个显得特别有精神，病人也大为减少了。有个叫皮列玛的妇女，到这里走娘家，就把哈顿胡硕巴嘎开展卫生工作的办法带回去推广。后来她们那里也成了全旗的卫生模范巴嘎之一。
    这几年，哈顿胡硕巴嘎的卫生模范事迹，年年受到上级人民政府的表扬，巴嘎里的人们爱清洁、讲卫生的风气，已在草原上传播开了。
