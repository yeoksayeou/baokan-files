　　Beijing Organizes Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team to Open Up Wasteland in Heilongjiang

　　Five young people from the suburbs of Beijing, Yang Hua, Li Bingheng, Pang Shuying, Li Liancheng, and Zhang Sheng, jointly wrote a letter of application to the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League in August, requesting approval for them to initiate the organization of a Beijing Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team to go to the border areas to reclaim wasteland. The application stated: If a reclamation team of sixty people can be formed, and with the support of some youth in Beijing, they can reclaim more than 3,000 mu of wasteland for the country without any money from the state, increasing wheat production by more than 300,000 jin. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League has approved their application. Comrades from the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League also met with these five young people and offered their opinions on the current issue of youth requesting reclamation. Comrades from the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League said: The patriotic enthusiasm of Yang Hua and the other four young people in initiating the organization of a volunteer reclamation team is extremely valuable and fully meets the hopes of the country and the people for our youth. Because this is the first team, we do not yet have experience, so the scale should not be too large; first organize sixty people to go, and gradually increase the number next year. Because they are determined to go to the border areas, it is agreed that they will go to Heilongjiang.

　　After the news of the organization of the Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team spread, young people in Beijing enthusiastically signed up. All three members of the Communist Youth League branch committee of Pingfang Township in the Eastern Suburbs District rushed to sign up. Li Yanhui (female) from Tuanhe Township in the Nan Yuan District, upon receiving the news at midnight, immediately braved the heavy rain to apply to the Youth League organization. Young people have been continuously flocking to the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Youth League committees of various districts to apply to join the reclamation team. In just a few days, the number of applicants has far exceeded the number needed. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League has selected sixty strong and determined young people, according to the instructions of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, preparing to go to Heilongjiang Province to reclaim wasteland.

　　The vast number of young people in Beijing are enthusiastically supporting this Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team. All the young people of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory have decided to voluntarily donate a portion of their bonus for completing production tasks ahead of schedule and exceeding the target, and send five double-wheeled double-share plows to the reclamation team. The Youth League organization of the Beijing No. 1 Automobile Accessory Factory has decided to support the reclamation team with two horses. Youth League organizations and young people from many government agencies, enterprises, military units, and schools in Beijing, Tianjin, Liaoning, Taiyuan, and other places have also written letters to the reclamation team, expressing their intention to learn from their spirit of loving the motherland and not fearing hardship, and have donated horses, double-wheeled double-share plows, walking plows, books, etc., to the reclamation team.

　　北京组织青年志愿垦荒队去黑龙江开荒
    北京市郊区青年杨华、李秉衡、庞淑英、李连成和张生等五人，在八月间联名给青年团北京市委会写了一份申请书，要求批准他们发起组织北京市青年志愿垦荒队到边疆去垦荒。申请书中说：如果能组成一个六十人的垦荒队，并得到北京市青年的一些支援，就可以不要国家一个钱，为国家开垦三千多亩荒地，增产三十多万斤小麦。青年团北京市委已批准了他们的申请。青年团中央书记处同志并接见了这五名青年，对目前青年要求垦荒问题提出了意见。青年团中央书记处同志说：杨华等五名青年发起组织志愿垦荒队，这种爱国热情是十分可贵的，是完全符合国家和人民对我们青年的希望的。因为这是第一支队伍，我们还没有经验，所以规模不宜太大，先组织六十人去，明年以后再陆续增加。因为他们坚决要求去边疆，所以同意他们到黑龙江去。
    组织青年志愿垦荒队的消息传出后，北京市自动要求报名的青年十分踊跃。东郊区平房乡的青年团支部委员会，三名支部委员全都争先要求报名。南苑区团河乡黎延惠（女）午夜十二时得到消息，当即冒着大雨向团组织申请报名。连日到青年团北京市委和各区团委要求参加垦荒队的青年络绎不绝。仅在几天内，报名人数已大大超过需要的人数。青年团北京市委已按照团中央书记处指示，选拔了六十名身强力壮有决心的青年，准备到黑龙江省开垦荒地。
    北京市广大青年热烈支援这支青年志愿垦荒队。北京农业机械厂全体青年决定把他们提前和超额完成生产任务的一部分奖金自愿捐献出来，送给垦荒队五部双轮双铧犁。北京第一汽车附件厂的团组织决定支援垦荒队两匹马。北京、天津、辽宁、太原等地的许多机关、企业、部队、学校的青年团组织和青年也纷纷写信给垦荒队，表示学习他们热爱祖国和不怕艰苦的精神，并分别捐赠马匹、双轮双铧犁、步犁、图书等给垦荒队。
