Xinhua News Agency, 13th August: TASS, London, 12th August: The British weekly "New Statesman and Nation" wrote in an article commenting on the Far East situation that, despite the easing of international tensions, some dangerous hotbeds still exist.

The weekly pointed out, "Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek, and Ngo Dinh Diem are people who make capital out of the 'Cold War,' so once peace is truly consolidated, they will be politically bankrupt. They are all doing their utmost to obstruct the real consolidation of peace."

The weekly wrote, "Ngo Dinh Diem is doing everything possible to obstruct the general elections to be held next year in accordance with the terms of the Geneva Accords, because he knows that he will be defeated in the elections. Chiang Kai-shek continues to attack British ships passing through the Taiwan Strait to ports of the People's Republic of China. And Syngman Rhee plotted attacks on the residences of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission personnel in South Korea."

The weekly called for these peace-endangering provocations to be stopped.

    英“新政治家与民族”周刊指出
    李承晚、蒋介石、吴庭艳之流危害和平
    新华社十三日讯　塔斯社伦敦十二日讯：英国的“新政治家与民族”周刊在评论远东局势的文章中写道，尽管国际紧张局势有了缓和，但是仍然存在一些危险的祸根。
    周刊指出，“李承晚、蒋介石、吴庭艳，这是一些靠‘冷战’捞取资本的人，因此一旦和平得到真正的巩固，他们在政治上就要破产。他们全都竭尽全力，阻挠和平得到真正的巩固。”
    周刊写道，“吴庭艳百般阻挠根据日内瓦协议的条款在明年举行普选，是因为他知道在普选中他要遭到失败。蒋介石继续袭击通过台湾海峡开往中华人民共和国港口的英国船只。而李承晚策划了对在南朝鲜的中立国监察委员会人员住所的袭击。”
    周刊号召制止这些危及和平的挑衅。
