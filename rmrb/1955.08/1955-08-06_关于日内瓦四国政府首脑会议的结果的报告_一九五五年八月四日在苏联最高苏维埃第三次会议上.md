The Soviet government delegation participated in the Geneva conference to engage in frank discussions with the heads of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on the most important international issues. The aim was to work together to ease international tensions and lay the foundations for trust among nations. The Soviet government has long advocated for such talks, believing that meetings of government leaders would create favorable conditions for reaching agreements that everyone would support to strengthen peace.

We attended the Geneva conference guided by the principles of the Leninist foreign policy of the Soviet state: peaceful coexistence with countries of different social systems and the struggle for international peace. Our starting point has always been and remains that the peaceful policy of the Soviet government serves the interests of the Soviet people. We have no doubt that this policy also aligns with the wishes of the peoples of all countries who have a direct stake in easing international tensions, ensuring peace, and security. The influence of the peace-loving people's movement on politics is growing, and politicians cannot ignore this situation.

Therefore, the summit of the heads of government of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union must be considered a positive achievement of the peace forces.

The meeting of the heads of government of the USSR, USA, UK, and France was the first since the Potsdam Conference in 1945. This fact alone is of great significance. It indicates a turning point in the relations between the USSR, USA, UK, and France.

At the Geneva conference, the leaders of the four powers established personal contacts and exchanged views on many issues related to the international situation. Whether in formal meetings or informal discussions, the atmosphere was one of cooperation and mutual understanding. It is satisfying to note that all participants expressed a desire for active results.

The Geneva summit of the heads of government of the four powers can be considered a major historical event because it marks a turning point in the relations between the USSR, USA, UK, and France.

**I. The International Situation on the Eve of the Geneva Conference**

Before discussing the work done by the participants in the Geneva conference and the results of that work, we must first describe the characteristics of the international situation that preceded this conference.

In the ten years since the end of the Second World War, relations between the countries that were allies in the fight against fascism have deteriorated. The Soviet Union, especially in the last one and a half to two years, has taken steps to ease international tensions, end the "cold war," and restore cooperation in the struggle for peace and the security of all peoples. The People's Republic of China and other people's democracies have also actively worked to strengthen peace alongside the Soviet Union.

It is impossible to ignore the fact that the recent efforts of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries to strengthen peace have produced positive results.

First, the ceasefire in Korea, achieved through the initiative of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and other peace-loving countries, contributed to the easing of tensions. This eliminated a dangerous war hotspot in the Far East, which threatened to escalate into a larger conflict with severe consequences for world peace.

Last year, at the Geneva conference of the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, with the participation of other concerned countries, an agreement was reached to stop military operations in Indochina. The cessation of military operations in Indochina was another major event that had significant implications not only for the consolidation of peace in Southeast Asia but also for improving the overall international situation. The 1954 Geneva Agreements, which ended the bloody war in Indochina, were based on the recognition of the legitimate national rights of the Indochinese peoples who sought complete national independence and freedom. This made the agreements particularly significant.

However, despite the significance of the end of the wars in Korea and Indochina, the international situation remained tense. Mutual mistrust and suspicion continued to exist between the various country blocs, and the atmosphere of the "cold war" persisted.

This situation created serious obstacles to further improving the international situation and establishing trust in international relations. Without trust, lasting or stable peace cannot be achieved.

In this regard, it is necessary to discuss in detail the so-called Paris Agreements that came into effect in May. It is known that the main goal of the Paris Agreements was to remilitarize West Germany and integrate it into the military blocs of the Western countries—the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union. These agreements paved the way for the revival of militarism in West Germany. In addition, the Paris Agreements sought to turn the remilitarized West Germany into a military ally of some Western countries—members of these blocs. Overall, the Paris Agreements were directed against the Soviet Union and the people's democracies and were harmful to the maintenance of peace in Europe.

The Soviet government has repeatedly called on the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, as well as the governments of the other signatory countries of the Paris Agreements, to pay attention to the fact that these agreements would lead to a deterioration of the overall situation in Europe and create a situation in which it would be impossible to solve the German question on the basis of a peaceful reunification of Germany. We pointed out that, under these circumstances, the German Democratic Republic could not be united with the remilitarized West Germany, which was involved in the military blocs of other countries.

Unfortunately, the Soviet warnings were then ignored. As a result, a situation arose in Europe that has become and may continue to be a serious obstacle to further easing of international tensions and the resolution of major international issues, and a source of conflict in the relations of the countries of Europe—and not only Europe.

The scale of the arms race is increasing year by year, especially in the production of atomic and hydrogen weapons, which naturally causes the peoples of the countries to be justifiably alarmed. In the past few years, military expenditures, especially of the signatory countries of the North Atlantic Treaty, have been steadily increasing.

The increase in military spending can be seen from the following figures taken from official publications of the relevant countries.

In the United States, direct military expenditures in 1948-1949 reached $12.9 billion, accounting for 32.6% of the federal budget. In the 1953-1954 fiscal year, these direct military expenditures increased to $46.5 billion, accounting for 68.6% of the federal budget. Thus, since 1948, the U.S. military budget has more than doubled, and its share of total U.S. expenditures has also more than doubled.

In the United Kingdom, direct military expenditures in the 1948-1949 fiscal year were £768 million, accounting for 24.2% of the budget. In 1953-1954, these direct military expenditures reached £1,637 million, or 38.3% of the total budget.

In France, direct military expenditures in 1949 were 289 billion francs, accounting for 23.8% of the total budget. France's direct military expenditures in 1954 reached 1,192 billion francs, or 32.5% of the total budget.

Given this situation, the Soviet Union had no choice but to take steps to strengthen its own armed forces. The 1955 Soviet military budget plan was 112.22 billion rubles, accounting for about 20% of the total budget. Due to the signing of the Paris Agreements, the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries in Europe had to sign the Warsaw Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance on May 14, which stipulated the joint use of their forces to ensure their security and maintain peace in Europe.

It is becoming increasingly clear that the continued expansion of armaments is exacerbating mistrust in international relations, increasing mutual suspicion between countries, and intensifying the propaganda for a new war. All this means that the "cold war" continues. The "cold war" disrupts normal economic and other relations between countries; the "cold war" results in various prohibitions and restrictions on international trade, and restrictions on the exchange of personnel engaged in industry, agriculture, science, and culture between countries. The "cold war" is an obstacle to easing international tensions and establishing the necessary trust between countries.

The situation in the Far East has caused particular concern among the peoples of the countries. Even after the cessation of the Korean War, the situation in this region remains tense, and this tension is constantly dangerous. The following facts illustrate this: the ancient Chinese territories—Taiwan Island and other islands—are actually occupied by foreign troops, which is naturally unacceptable to the Chinese people.

The Soviet government has proposed convening a conference of the concerned countries to resolve the Taiwan issue. Unfortunately, this proposal has not yet produced positive results. The Soviet government also supports the proposal of the government of the People's Republic of China for direct negotiations between the People's Republic of China and the United States on unresolved issues in Sino-American relations. It is known that such negotiations have already begun. These negotiations are being held under favorable conditions. The decision to release eleven American pilots convicted of espionage before the end of their sentences is a gesture of goodwill on the part of the People's Republic of China, which cannot but have a positive impact on the negotiations.

The restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is of great importance. Indeed, it is impossible to artificially exclude a great power, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council—the People's Republic of China—from the United Nations and not allow it to participate in the study of certain international issues.

The Soviet government recognizes that the longer the tense situation in the relations between individual countries persists, the more the international situation, filled with the danger of a new war, deteriorates. Therefore, it is necessary to take fundamental measures at the international level to ease the situation and restore trust between countries.

Therefore, the Soviet government, guided by the interests of maintaining and strengthening peace, has taken the initiative in this regard and has taken several important diplomatic steps last year that have received widespread support from the peace-loving peoples of all countries.

It cannot be denied that the peaceful actions taken by the Soviet government have already eased the tensions in international relations.

The Soviet government's proposal of May 10 on the reduction of armaments, the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and the elimination of the threat of a new war is of great importance for easing international tensions. These proposals have been welcomed by world public opinion, and they are considered an important contribution to peace. Reaching the necessary agreements on the basis of these proposals will undoubtedly play a major role in achieving lasting peace.

The significance of the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty on the initiative of the Soviet Union cannot be overestimated.

As a result of the resolution of the Austrian question, Austria has become an independent and sovereign state, and it has guaranteed the implementation of a policy of permanent neutrality, which is in the national interests of the Austrian people and in the interests of maintaining peace in Europe. At the same time, the successful resolution of the Austrian question shows that the great powers, which bear the main responsibility for maintaining peace, have not fully utilized all possible opportunities to resolve outstanding international issues.

Naturally, this resolution has accelerated the movement to resolve other urgent issues.

Special mention should be made of the significant role played by the improvement of Soviet-Yugoslav relations in the cause of peace. The talks held in Belgrade ended the abnormal and unacceptable situation that had existed between the two countries since 1948, when the fraternal friendship and close cooperation between the peoples of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union were artificially interrupted. The abnormal situation that had existed in Soviet-Yugoslav relations until recently could only be to the advantage of the enemies of peace. It caused great harm to the vital interests of the two countries and to the interests of maintaining international peace. This situation could not continue, and the governments of the two countries concluded that Soviet-Yugoslav relations must be fundamentally improved.

In the future, the basis of the relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia will be the recognition of the indivisibility of peace, respect for sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and equality, the promotion of peaceful cooperation between the peoples of the two countries, mutual respect, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.

The results achieved in improving Soviet-Yugoslav relations give every reason to believe that these two countries have chosen the only correct path, and that the governments of the two countries are treating the task of improving and strengthening the relations between the Soviet Union and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia very seriously. We express our respect to our Yugoslav friends and to President Tito of Yugoslavia from this rostrum, and we believe it is necessary to state that the Central Committee of our Party, the Soviet government, and all the Soviet people will continue to strive to move forward together with the fraternal Yugoslav people along the path of friendship and sincere cooperation that we have chosen together.

It is necessary to mention once again the great significance of the visit of Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to the Soviet Union. The exchange of views between Jawaharlal Nehru and the leaders of the Soviet government and the Soviet-Indian joint declaration show that the two countries have a firm determination to develop and strengthen the friendly relations that have already developed between the Soviet Union and India. The two countries' attitudes toward the urgent issues of the struggle for peace are consistent, which is of great significance for the resolution of the urgent issues in Asia and the Far East and for easing world tensions.

The Soviet government attaches great importance to Soviet-Indian cooperation, considering it an important factor in the struggle for peace in Asia, and not only in Asia; it considers it necessary to maintain this cooperation in the future on the basis of the principles announced in the Soviet-Indian declaration, which have received broad support from the peace-loving countries. The further development of personal contacts between the leaders of the governments of the two countries will undoubtedly strengthen this cooperation.

Guided by the concern for maintaining and strengthening peace, the Soviet government has taken several other important steps that can produce significant constructive results. Specifically, I am referring to the Soviet government's proposal to the government of the Federal Republic of Germany to establish diplomatic, trade, and cultural relations and the current Soviet-Japanese negotiations in London.

In general, this was the international situation that had taken shape on the eve of the Geneva summit of the heads of government of the four powers. These were the factors that brought some easing of international tensions and thus created favorable conditions for the convening of the Geneva conference.

**II. The Geneva Conference and the Proposals of the Soviet Government**

The Soviet government proceeded from the premise that the main task of the summit of the heads of government of the four powers should be to further ease international tensions and promote the establishment of the necessary trust in international relations. Only under such conditions can one seriously discuss the resolution of outstanding international issues.

On this principle, the Soviet delegation stated at the beginning of the Geneva conference that the purpose of the conference was not to make mutual accusations but to explore ways and means to further ease international tensions and establish an atmosphere of trust in international relations. We frankly stated that our motive for coming to Geneva was to seek, through joint efforts, ways to resolve outstanding issues, and we expressed our willingness to carefully consider the proposals put forward by the other participants.

The Soviet delegation also asked the politicians of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to note that the Soviet delegation did not underestimate the difficulties on the path to resolving outstanding issues, including Asian and European issues. However, if all participants come to the conference with the intention of finding ways to overcome these difficulties, this is a sure guarantee that the conference will produce positive results.

The heads of government of the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union spoke at the first meeting on July 18 about their views on the main international issues and the tasks of the conference. At the same time, they expressed their opinions on the issues to be discussed.

All participants advocated discussing the following issues: the German question, the disarmament question, the European security question, and the question of developing East-West contacts.

Unfortunately, our proposal that the conference should discuss Asian and Far Eastern issues was not accepted, although, if one looks at the facts, the urgency of these issues is quite obvious.

Of course, the Soviet delegation could not agree to discuss the issue of the situation in the Eastern European countries and the issue of "international communism." We pointed out that raising the issue of the situation in the Eastern European countries at this conference would be tantamount to urging us to interfere in the internal affairs of these countries.

Moreover, it is clear to everyone that the people's democratic systems in these countries were established by the people themselves according to their free will. In addition, no one has ever authorized us to discuss the situation in these countries. As for the issue of "international communism" (in some places, it is used to frighten naive people), we said that the Geneva conference was convened to discuss issues of relations between countries, not to discuss the activities of certain political parties in various countries or the relations between these parties. Therefore, raising this issue at the summit of the heads of government cannot be considered appropriate.

Turning to the substance of the issues raised by the Soviet government for discussion at the Geneva conference, we should first discuss the proposals related to ensuring European security.

The importance of this issue is obvious. Historical experience shows that the most brutal and destructive wars have been waged in Europe. Both the First and Second World Wars broke out in Europe and then spread to other countries and continents, bringing incalculable sacrifices and material destruction to humanity. All this shows how important it is to establish a reliable security system in Europe for the cause of universal peace.

The Soviet government has always believed, and still believes, that the conclusion of a pan-European treaty, that is, the establishment of a collective security system with the participation of all European countries and the United States, is the most reliable way to ensure European security. The establishment of such a security system to replace military blocs of some European countries against other European countries is in the interests of the peoples of the European countries, and the policy of establishing military blocs has more than once pushed the peoples of the European countries into the abyss of war.

Last year, when we made this proposal, some Western countries told us that the Soviet proposal did not suit them because it undermined the military bloc system they had established for the so-called defensive interests. Moreover, they showed particular concern for the fate of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, insisting that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was established solely for defensive purposes. In view of such statements, the Soviet government then decided to join this organization because joining an organization with a defensive purpose is completely in our interests. The Soviet Union made concrete efforts to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and sent a note to this effect to the member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. However, we were officially notified that our application to join was rejected. This could not but cause the Soviet side to be justifiably concerned and vigilant. Obviously, the purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is far from consistent with the claim that this organization is of a defensive nature.

Considering that the governments of some countries are not willing to abandon—at least for the time being—their military blocs, in order to promote agreement among the concerned countries, we made a new proposal at the Geneva conference on the establishment of a European collective security system. We proposed that the establishment of such a security system be divided into two stages.

In the first stage, the North Atlantic Treaty, the Paris Agreements, and the Warsaw Treaty would remain in force, and all the countries participating in these blocs, as we propose, should undertake the obligation not to use armed force against each other and to resolve all possible disputes between them only by peaceful means.

Our proposal also stipulates that before reaching agreements on the reduction of armaments, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the withdrawal of foreign troops from the territories of European countries, the participating countries of the European collective security should undertake the obligation not to take any measures to increase their armed forces in the territories of other European countries.

Finally, the Soviet proposal mentions that the participating countries of the European collective security should consult with each other as necessary to avoid threatening situations in Europe and take measures agreed upon unanimously to maintain peace.

Thus, the Soviet proposal, on the one hand, takes into account the real situation in Europe when certain military blocs exist, and on the other hand, when this proposal is accepted, it can guarantee the peaceful coexistence of the European countries. At the same time, according to the European collective security treaty, none of these countries will assume any other obligations in the first stage except the obligation not to use armed force.

This proposal has another advantage: it provides the opportunity to actually test this system, based on the joint efforts of all European countries for peace, albeit on a limited scale, over a certain period of time.

In the second stage, the aforementioned countries naturally should assume all the obligations related to the establishment of the European collective security system according to the corresponding treaties.

Based on this, the North Atlantic Treaty, the Paris Agreements, and the Warsaw Treaty should cease to be in force completely and simultaneously, and the blocs established on the basis of these agreements should be abolished, to be replaced by a pan-European collective security system.

We advocated in Geneva that, in the end, there should be no foreign troops on the territory of the European countries, and in this regard, we should return to the situation before the Second World War. We believe that this approach is in line with the wishes of the peoples of the European countries for peace and independent existence and is completely in line with the task of ensuring the security of the peoples of the European countries.

We are convinced that only when the policy of military blocs ends, only when all European countries and the United States jointly strive for peace, will the true security of the European countries be achieved and will be guaranteed.

Different countries live different lives. Among the inhabitants of these countries, there are believers and non-believers, communists and anti-communists, but they are all united in one thing: they are equally concerned with maintaining and strengthening peace. If this is the case, then one should not be stingy with efforts to achieve this goal.

When we proposed specific proposals to ensure the security of all of Europe, we pointed out that this proposal is not the only way to solve this important task. We are willing to consider proposals from other countries that, to varying degrees, are consistent with the task of consolidating European security. On this point, the Soviet delegation has already stated at the Geneva conference.

The Soviet delegation clearly stated that the idea of British Prime Minister Anthony Eden that it is possible to conclude a security pact with a smaller number of countries is worthy of attention. The conclusion of such a pact, initially with the participation of the four great powers—the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France—and other European countries, may have a positive significance. In this regard, it should be noted that this pact must take into account the actual situation that has existed in Germany for the past ten years, that is, the existence of two German states. We believe that it is quite possible to find a way to combine the interests of European security with the interests of the development of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany in such a way that it is in the interests of the German people and the interests of universal peace.

It should be considered that at the four-power foreign ministers' conference to be held in October, new possibilities will be explored to reach an agreement on this important issue. It cannot be said that such a possibility no longer exists.

Here, it is necessary to mention our other proposal on European security, which has been submitted to the four-power foreign ministers' conference to be held in October for consideration. The proposal of the Soviet government I am referring to is that the participating countries of the existing blocs in Europe should undertake the obligation not to use armed force against each other before the establishment of a pan-European security system. It goes without saying that this obligation should not impair the right of a country to self-defense, individually or collectively, in the event of armed attack, as stipulated in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, on which we have already stated in Geneva.

We believe that it is difficult to oppose this proposal. Indeed, let us assume that the conclusion of an agreement on the conclusion of a treaty to ensure European security (whether all European countries participate or only a part of the European countries participate at the beginning) may be delayed. We said in Geneva: in this case, why can't we agree on this point: the participants of the existing Western military blocs and the Warsaw Pact undertake the simple but very much in the interests of the peoples of all countries obligation not to use armed force against each other? The conclusion of a treaty on this point by the participants of the existing blocs would undoubtedly be a big step forward in the establishment of an effective European security system.

On the issue of European security, including the recent proposals of the Soviet government, no final agreement was reached. However, as a result of the exchange of views between the heads of government of the four powers, it was agreed that this issue should be further studied. At the same time, the representatives of the three Western countries also mentioned their support for studying the Soviet government's proposal for the conclusion of a treaty between the Western blocs and the Warsaw Pact.

At the Geneva conference, we raised an increasingly urgent issue: the four powers should support those countries that wish to pursue a policy of neutrality and not join military blocs and alliances. It is known that in some countries in Europe, the Near East, and the Middle East, the movement for neutrality is growing stronger. This desire is quite understandable because history shows that countries that pursue a policy of neutrality have ensured the security of their peoples and played a constructive role. We said in Geneva that if one or another country that wishes to pursue a policy of neutrality raises the issue of guarantees of its security and the inviolability of its territory, the Soviet Union would be ready to join other countries in providing such guarantees.

It is known that the Soviet Union has already made such a proposal regarding Austria, and the four-power foreign ministers' Vienna conference has already reached an agreement in principle on the issue of the four governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France respecting Austrian neutrality.

We believe that after the Geneva conference, this issue remains urgent and deserves special attention.

At the Geneva conference, views were exchanged on the German question. It should be noted that on the issue of solving this general problem and the direction in which Germany should develop, different attitudes were expressed. Whether Germany will develop in a direction that meets the requirements of maintaining peace in Europe, or whether it will, as in the past, follow the path of reviving militarism and creating a new source of war in the heart of Europe, this issue is of the utmost importance for the security of the peoples of the European countries.

The representatives of the three Western countries defended the Paris Agreements, which stipulate the remilitarization of West Germany and its integration into the military blocs of the Western countries. At the same time, they did not hide the fact that they did not see any other way for a united Germany except to join the aforementioned Western blocs. Obviously, the Soviet Union will not and cannot agree with this view because this view is not in the interests of European security, including the security of the Soviet Union, and we cannot and do not have the right to ignore this.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 4th

In this regard, they replied to us that three Western countries could agree to conclude a five-nation pact involving the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and a unified Germany, and agree that this pact's aforementioned participating countries would provide the Soviet Union with "security guarantees." We responded that we hope to clarify this issue of guaranteeing the Soviet Union. We said that for a small country without sufficient armed forces to guarantee its own security, the proposal for guarantees is understandable. It is quite obvious that for the Soviet Union, any such proposal is utterly groundless.

It should also be noted that the issue is that this guarantee is being offered by countries bound by unilateral military obligations under other treaties and agreements, which are clearly directed against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

The Soviet Union believes that the most reliable guarantee of European security is first and foremost the establishment of a European security system and the prevention of German militarism's revival and Germany becoming a new hotbed of aggression in Europe.

We stated our views on the German question in Geneva. We said that the implementation of the Paris Agreements, that is, the remilitarization of West Germany, the restoration of West Germany's military potential, and the inclusion of West Germany in Western military blocs, is incompatible with the task of unifying Germany.

We had previously reminded the governments of the United States, Britain, and France of the consequences of the Paris Agreements.

Now that the Paris Agreements have come into effect and are being implemented, this has created a new situation that cannot be ignored. However, this also means that since the Paris Agreements exist, the solution to the German question should follow a different path, that is, easing international tensions in Europe, dismantling existing military blocs of various countries, and establishing an effective European collective security system. The German states and other relevant countries should strive in this direction.

We can only be satisfied to note that the West German public and West German newspapers are increasingly resolute and frequent in demanding that the West German government change its policy on the unification of Germany, as this policy, based on the remilitarization of West Germany and its inclusion in military blocs, excludes the possibility of unifying Germany.

Such is the situation regarding Germany, where we are talking about the external, international conditions for unification.

However, we must not forget that within Germany itself, there are internal conditions that are also of great significance in determining Germany's future.

The current Germany is no longer the Germany of the early post-Hitler era. Over the past decade, two independent German states have emerged on German territory—the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany—and both of these republics have been recognized by other countries as sovereign states. Both countries maintain diplomatic and trade relations with other countries and participate in various European treaties and agreements.

It is impossible to ignore the fact that different social and economic systems have emerged in these two countries. In the German Democratic Republic, the workers and their allies—the laboring peasants and intellectuals—are in power and have embarked on the path of socialist construction, firmly believing in the correctness of the path they have chosen. It is entirely understandable that when the working people of the German Democratic Republic declare that they cannot allow the achievements they have gained during this period to be threatened, they are speaking from the heart.

In resolving the issue of unifying Germany, it is impossible not to consider the opinions of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. In other words, this issue cannot be resolved without the participation of the Germans themselves.

All of this indicates that under the current international and domestic conditions in Germany, it is not possible to unify Germany by mechanically merging its two parts. Any such attempt and plan is doomed to failure because these plans and attempts do not take into account the realities of the situation. Under the current conditions, the solution to the German question can only be achieved gradually through cooperation between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, through their mutual rapprochement in accordance with the requirements of peace and progress.

In Geneva, we did not find a common basis on the German question. However, the Soviet delegation clearly expressed its position during the exchange of views, and it is expected that this exchange of views will have important significance when the four foreign ministers reconvene in October to discuss the issues raised at the Geneva Conference.

The Soviet government is fully aware that the foreign ministers will encounter many difficulties and obstacles on the road to solving the German question. This is understandable because the summit of the four governments has already shown two different attitudes towards solving the German question.

However, the difficulties in solving the German question should not become obstacles to the smooth conduct of the foreign ministers' conference, especially they should not become obstacles to solving the major and fundamental issue of establishing a European security system that the foreign ministers must discuss.

The issue of disarmament received attention at the Geneva Conference. This can be explained by the significance of the issue itself. The expansion of armed forces and the unprecedented development and improvement of armaments year by year are causing legitimate concerns among the peoples of various countries about their future. It is particularly necessary to emphasize this point now, as atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction are being produced and stockpiled.

Negotiations on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons have been ongoing for nearly ten years, and it is known that these negotiations have not yielded the expected results. The "cold war" and mistrust between countries, especially between the major powers, have caused these negotiations to effectively stall in recent years.

The Soviet government believes that the main task in studying the issue of disarmament at present is to find ways to bring the attitudes of various countries on this issue closer together and to reach the necessary agreements on the reduction of conventional armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

The famous proposal made by the Soviet government on May 10 regarding the reduction of armaments, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the elimination of new threats of war is precisely in line with this purpose. It is appropriate here to mention the positive attitude of the broad public and many countries in Europe and Asia towards these proposals, which rightly call these proposals a major step by the Soviet government in the struggle for peace and the security of the peoples of various countries.

Since the new proposals made by the Soviet government in the United Nations have not been discussed in practice, and the governments of the United States, Britain, and France have not expressed their attitudes towards these proposals, the Soviet delegation naturally paid primary attention to the attitudes of these governments towards these proposals in the Geneva Conference. We drew attention to the fact that the Soviet Union agrees with the Western countries' proposal on the level of armaments of the five major powers, that is, the armed forces of the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China should each be between one million and one and a half million, and France and Britain should be sixty-five thousand. In this regard, we have reason to expect that the three Western countries will adopt an attitude on the atomic weapons issue that can promote agreement on this issue. Thus, the disarmament issue as a whole can be built on a solid foundation.

However, considering that it may take a considerable amount of time to reach an agreement on the reduction of conventional armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons, we also proposed that the participating countries of the Geneva Conference should now guarantee not to be the first to use atomic and hydrogen weapons and call on other countries to do the same.

In the Soviet proposal of May 10, it was particularly emphasized that an effective international supervision system should be established to oversee the implementation of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

As the American President rightly pointed out, every disarmament plan ultimately comes down to the issue of supervision and inspection. This is indeed a very serious issue, and we should seek mutually acceptable ways to solve this problem.

The Soviet government believes that the necessary conditions for establishing such an international supervision that can enjoy the trust of various countries and fully conform to the interests of international security are currently lacking. The American government also agrees with this. The American President, on the eve of the Geneva Conference, expressed doubts about the current feasibility of opening all American factories for unlimited inspection, which is understandable.

So, what should be done? The Soviet government believes that the issue of establishing international supervision and the powers and rights of the international supervision organization should be studied in close connection with measures to ease international tensions, strengthen trust between countries, and implement other measures related to the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

The American President Eisenhower proposed at the Geneva Conference to organize the exchange of military intelligence between the Soviet Union and the United States and to conduct aerial photography on each other's territories.

While the desire to find a way to solve such a complex problem as international supervision expressed in this proposal is commendable, it is impossible not to point out that the practical effect of such measures is not great.

In our informal talks with the leaders of the American government, we frankly stated that aerial photography cannot achieve the expected results because our two countries have vast territories, and on this vast land, one can hide anything one wants to hide. It is also necessary to consider the fact that the proposed plan only involves the territories of the two countries themselves, while the armed forces and military equipment stationed on the territories of other countries are left out of the picture.

We believe that the detailed proposal made by the Soviet government on May 10 regarding the establishment of international supervision is more realistic and effective. This proposal stipulates that in the first stage of implementing measures to reduce armaments and prohibit atomic weapons, the international supervision organization should be granted extensive powers and rights.

The Soviet government proposed in its May 10 proposal an important method of supervision, that is, it advocates that the international supervision organization should immediately establish inspection stations on a reciprocal basis in the territories of the relevant countries to prevent one country from suddenly attacking another country. We propose that these inspection stations be set up at major ports, railway junctions, highways, and airports. They will conduct inspections to prevent the dangerous concentration and movement of ground forces and air and naval forces.

The Soviet delegation expressed its hope in Geneva to immediately begin reducing the number of armed forces and the quantity of armaments. We proposed that the four major powers set an example in this regard and reduce personnel equivalent to the number of troops withdrawn from Austria. The Soviet government, in accordance with this proposal, decided a few days ago to withdraw all Soviet troops from Austria by October 1 and reduce personnel equivalent to the number of troops withdrawn from Austria in the total number of Soviet troops. Similar measures by the other three countries can help create an atmosphere of international trust and conform to the interests of disarmament.

All our proposals are for a simple and clear purpose: to further ease international tensions, free the peoples of various countries from the terror of war, and make them believe that they can live and work in peace for the benefit of future generations.

Millions of people are eagerly demanding this. The following fact can illustrate this: during the Soviet delegation's stay in Geneva, we received numerous letters from various organizations and individuals from many countries. During those days, several hundred delegations from France, the two parts of Germany, and other countries came to Geneva. They firmly demanded the end of the "cold war" and the creation of the necessary conditions for the peaceful and quiet life of the people.

Of course, we do not believe that we can reach an agreement on all the proposals made by the Soviet delegation in five or six days. Experience has shown that it takes time to reach agreements on such issues, especially on a complex issue such as concluding an international convention on the reduction of armaments, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the establishment of effective international supervision for the implementation of these measures. Therefore, we propose that the heads of the four governments focus their attention on those issues on which they have already reached substantial agreement or are very close to agreement. This applies first and foremost to the level of armaments of the five powers, the solution to the problem of phased reduction of conventional armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and international supervision. Our starting point is that if the Geneva Conference can reach an agreement on some major issues regarding disarmament, it will greatly facilitate further study of this issue and the conclusion of the aforementioned international convention.

As for the substantive part of the disarmament issue, the decision has been made to continue exploring the path to reaching an agreement, and the foreign ministers have been given the corresponding instructions in this regard.

The fourth issue on the agenda of the Geneva Conference is the development of contacts between the East and the West.

The Soviet Union has always advocated and continues to advocate broad international cooperation and the comprehensive development of economic, scientific, and cultural relations between countries. We believe that the exchange of delegations between countries and the organization of mutual visits by industrial, agricultural, trade, scientific, cultural, artistic, and social activists are very beneficial. We also advocate the development of travel.

We believe that the exchange of agricultural delegations between the Soviet Union and the United States is a good thing, and we are satisfied with the good atmosphere surrounding the visit of the Soviet delegation in the United States and the visit of the American delegation in the Soviet Union.

Now, negotiations are also underway between Britain and the Soviet Union on the development of cultural cooperation. We hope that the negotiations will achieve a satisfactory result. It should also be noted that in the informal talks with British Prime Minister Eden, we discussed the issue of organizing mutual visits of naval fleets and military delegations in a positive sense.

The result of the discussion on the issue of East-West contacts at the Geneva Conference is that the heads of the four governments, based on the proposal of President Eisenhower, adopted the following resolution:

"The foreign ministers should, through expert studies of measures—including measures that can be taken in the United Nations and its specialized agencies—they should (a) promote the gradual removal of obstacles to free intercourse and peaceful trade between the peoples of various countries; (b) promote freer and more mutually beneficial contacts and exchanges between the relevant countries and peoples."

Undoubtedly, success in this area will greatly promote the easing of international tensions, the strengthening of mutual trust between countries, and the development of international cooperation, and in this regard, much remains to be done between the four countries.

I have already said that the Soviet government also proposed that the Geneva Conference discuss the urgent issues of Asia and the Far East. Although no agreement was reached on the necessity of formally discussing the urgent issues of Asia and the Far East at the Geneva Conference, we did exchange views informally with the leaders of the American, British, and French delegations on these issues. In these informal off-site talks, the issues of implementing the 1954 Geneva Agreements in the Indochina question and the issues of relations between the United States and the People's Republic of China were discussed. Of course, on our side, the primary concern was the Taiwan issue and the rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. The Soviet government hopes that such an exchange of views will help in resolving these issues in a manner that is in line with the legitimate rights of the Chinese and other Asian peoples and in the interests of maintaining peace in the Far East.

It is necessary to emphasize the great significance of the new proposals made by the government of the People's Republic of China, which aim to resolve the unresolved international issues and create favorable prospects for the establishment of international trust in Asia and the Pacific region. The Soviet government fully supports the proposals made by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China in his speech on July 30 at the Second Session of the National People's Congress regarding the current international situation and the foreign policy of the People's Republic of China.

The Geneva Conference finally adopted instructions for the foreign ministers on all four issues discussed by the heads of government, namely: the European security issue, the German issue, the disarmament issue, and the development of East-West contacts. These instructions are very important because they express the desire of all participants in the conference to find the possibility of reaching the necessary agreements between countries through a more detailed study of the aforementioned issues. The great significance of the instructions adopted in Geneva lies precisely in this.

Three, the results of the Geneva Conference and our conclusions

In summing up the results of the Geneva Summit of the four governments, it is necessary to recall that before we set out for Geneva, we had said that it would be too naive to expect that all complex international problems could be solved in just a few days. Only those who believe in miracles would think so. At the same time, we firmly opposed the groundless pessimistic views.

Facts have proven that this assessment of the situation is correct. Now, no one can deny that the Geneva Conference produced significant positive results, which will have an even greater impact in the future. The Geneva Conference played an important role in easing the tension in international relations, especially between the major powers, and in restoring the necessary trust between them.

The summit of the four governments was held in an atmosphere of cooperation and mutual understanding, and undoubtedly, it will leave a deep impression on international relations and have a beneficial influence on the future development of international relations. The establishment of personal contacts between the heads of the four major governments is of great significance.

The spirit of cooperation and the desire for mutual understanding that permeated the conference is gratifying. This is particularly evident in the informal meetings, which allowed everyone to exchange views openly and frankly on various issues. It should be particularly noted that we did not encounter any other emotions at the Geneva Conference. On the contrary, everyone was looking for the possibility of aligning the views on the actual issues discussed at the conference, although there were differences in the attitudes towards the substance of the issues discussed.

Together with the leaders of the United States, Britain, and France, we clarified the common points of our countries on the issues discussed and more clearly understood the differences in our views, and decided to continue to seek ways to reach the necessary agreements. We do not doubt that through further talks, it will be possible to overcome the existing difficulties and find ways to resolve the unresolved issues in accordance with the interests of peace.

The instructions drafted at the conference for the four foreign ministers are the result of seeking decisions that everyone can accept, and in seeking such decisions, the interests of all participants in the talks were taken into account. Only in this way can important international issues be solved. The policy of "position of strength" was set aside in Geneva. We can only welcome this, especially because the constructive spirit of the Geneva talks is now continuing to have a good influence on international relations. For example, it is impossible not to note that in recent days, both in the United States and in Britain, there has been a view that the principle of relations between countries should be "negotiation, not force," which is of considerable importance for future diplomatic talks.

We believed that the Geneva Conference would produce positive results, and indeed, we were not wrong. Now we believe that as long as there is sincerity and consideration for the interests of all parties concerned, the four countries can achieve new positive results in the future in discussing and resolving unresolved international issues.

The results of the Geneva Conference have been welcomed by the broad public around the world. The peoples of various countries welcome the results of the conference as an important victory in their struggle to maintain and consolidate peace. At the same time, they express their determination to continue their efforts and carry the cause to completion. In general, the results of the Geneva Conference can be appropriately considered as a major step forward in the direction of peace and the end of the "cold war."

Government officials of various countries also acknowledge the achievements of the Geneva Conference with satisfaction.

The participants in the Geneva Conference, American President Eisenhower, British Prime Minister Eden, and French Prime Minister Faure, all made statements on the results of the Geneva Conference. It should be noted that all these statements contain the spirit of cooperation and mutual understanding, which helped to ensure the success of the Geneva Conference and opened up the prospect of further strengthening trust between countries. We particularly welcome the words of President Eisenhower: "We must make constructive progress, not just repeat the past lifeless and passive performances."

It should be noted that there is a growing willingness in recent American officials to draw the appropriate conclusions and promote the normalization of international relations. It can be said with satisfaction that forces have emerged in the United States to act in this direction. For example, it is very appropriate to mention the speech of Senator William George, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who firmly advocates the early convening of a foreign ministers' conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China. Mr. George rightly believes that the normalization of relations between the United States and China will ensure significant achievements in the direction of easing tensions in the Far East.

It is noteworthy that the majority of newspapers have given a good evaluation of the results of the Geneva Conference.

For example, the influential American newspaper "The New York Times" wrote that the possibility of conflict in the West even disappeared before the highest-level conference, and due to the relationship between the four major powers that has been established at present, it can be expected that every effort will be made to avoid serious trouble in Asia.

The widely circulated British newspaper "The World News" published an article by Conservative MP Busby. Busby believes that the Geneva Conference is a great victory for the moral forces of the world, which will in the future exert an increasingly greater pressure on the governments of various countries to support peace.

It is noteworthy that the following passage from the French "People's Newspaper" is worth noting: "Of course, the instructions given to the foreign ministers have not solved the problems raised. However, the fact that the instructions were given itself proves the desire for peace shown by the four major powers. We do not harbor illusions. There are still difficulties ahead. However, the Geneva Conference has created a new atmosphere, and this provides the basis for hope... In Geneva, the 'cold war' has stopped, and the prospect of a stable peace has emerged."

During the Geneva Conference, British Prime Minister Eden and the Soviet delegation discussed the issue of strengthening relations between the two countries. You know from the newspapers that Sir Anthony Eden invited me and Comrade Khrushchev to visit Britain, and we accepted the invitation.

The following communiqué has been issued, which we have agreed with the British government on this matter: "During the Geneva Conference, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union discussed the importance of maintaining the personal contacts they had established in Geneva as a means of strengthening relations between their two countries. The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Nikolai A. Bulganin, and the member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Nikita S. Khrushchev, have accepted the invitation of Sir Anthony Eden to visit the United Kingdom in the spring of next year."

The Soviet government actively supports the initiative of the British government because it believes that the development of personal contacts between the highest-level officials will have great significance in maintaining the atmosphere of business cooperation established at the Geneva Conference.

The British Parliament unanimously supported the announcement made by British Prime Minister Eden regarding the visit of the Soviet leaders to Britain. It is hoped that the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union will also unanimously support our decision to visit Britain.

The Soviet government, advocating personal contacts between national leaders and striving to strengthen relations between the Soviet Union and France, has decided to invite French Prime Minister Faure and French Foreign Minister Bidon to visit the Soviet Union at a time convenient for them.

We hope that the French government will accept this invitation.

The visit of the leaders of the French government to the Soviet Union and personal contacts with them will help to further the favorable development of Soviet-French relations.

Comrades,

The results of the Geneva Conference clearly confirm the correctness of the foreign policy of the Soviet government aimed at ensuring peaceful coexistence among countries. Relying on the support of the entire Soviet people, the Soviet government will continue to move forward on this path in the future.

The Geneva Summit of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France laid a good foundation for the restoration of cooperation between our four countries, which had developed successfully during the Second World War in the common struggle against the aggressors, but was disrupted in the post-war period. The current task is to develop this cooperation on the basis of the sincere business contacts and mutual respect established in Geneva.

The joint efforts of the four countries participating in the Geneva Conference to end the "cold war" and reach a consensus on urgent international issues are one of the main conditions for ensuring lasting world peace.

The results of the Geneva Conference show:

First, the conference has undoubtedly promoted the further easing of international tensions, and we hope that it will help to achieve such a lofty goal as the establishment of a solid and lasting peace. The Soviet government will take all measures to achieve this goal.

Second, the personal contacts between the politicians of the four countries during the conference have proven to be very fruitful, and the significance of these contacts is not less than that of formal talks.

The Soviet government will also be ready in the future to promote the development and strengthening of contacts between politicians of various countries.

Third, the Geneva Conference marks the beginning of an important turning point in the improvement of relations between the four countries, and not only between the four countries. We hope that this turning point will end the "cold war" if both sides show sincerity and a genuine desire for cooperation.

The Soviet government has taken and will continue to take all measures to end the "cold war," eliminate tensions in international relations, and ensure lasting world peace.

The results of the Geneva Conference prove that it has brought positive results for the cause of peace.

However, we must still find ways to solve the unresolved international issues, and from this point of view, the foreign ministers' conference scheduled for October is of great significance.

According to the instructions formulated by the heads of the four governments, the foreign ministers will continue to consider the issues of European security, the German issue, disarmament, and the development of East-West contacts, and will propose effective solutions to these issues. The foreign ministers will inevitably encounter difficulties on the road to solving these complex international issues. However, these difficulties are not insurmountable.

We hope that if the participants in the upcoming foreign ministers' conference show the desire for cooperation and agreement that characterized the atmosphere of the heads of government conference, then the four foreign ministers will make progress in solving the unresolved international issues.

The Soviet government will do everything possible to ensure that the upcoming foreign ministers' conference successfully resolves the issues it faces.

In the direction of normalizing the international situation and establishing trust and cooperation between countries, initial achievements have been made. However, we cannot close our eyes to the difficulties ahead. We know that the Geneva talks are only the beginning of a great and arduous task aimed at establishing genuine trust between countries and consolidating peace.

It should not be forgotten that there will be forces trying to obstruct the achievement of this goal. This requires unwavering and persistent spirit in the struggle for international peace. This requires us to continue to strengthen the power of our homeland, develop our socialist economy, and show the necessary vigilance and concern for the defense forces of the Soviet state.

The Soviet government has done everything possible to create favorable conditions for the successful conduct of the summit of the four governments. The Soviet government will spare no effort to ensure the implementation of the decisions of the Geneva Conference, to the benefit of universal peace and security. Relying on the strong support of the Soviet people and all peace-loving peoples of the world, the Soviet government will continue to steadfastly pursue a policy aimed at further easing international tensions and struggling for lasting world peace.

    关于日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的结果的报告
    ——一九五五年八月四日在苏联最高苏维埃第三次会议上
    苏联部长会议主席  布尔加宁代表同志们！
    苏联部长会议委托我向苏联最高苏维埃报告七月十八日到二十三日在日内瓦举行的苏、美、英、法四国政府首脑会议的结果。
    苏联政府代表团参加日内瓦会议，是为了要同美、英、法三国政府的首脑坦率地讨论最重要的国际问题，共同努力争取缓和国际紧张局势和奠定建立国际间的信任的基础。苏联政府老早就主张举行这种会谈，它认为：各国政府首脑的会晤将为谋求大家都同意的巩固和平的决议造成有利的条件。
    我们本着列宁主义的苏维埃国家外交政策——不同社会制度的国家和平共处的政策和为争取国际和平而奋斗的政策——的主要原则，出席日内瓦会议。我们过去和现在所持的出发点是：苏联政府的和平政策是符合苏联人民的利益的。我们毫不怀疑，这种政策也是符合同缓和国际紧张局势、保障和平和安全有切身利害关系的各国人民的愿望的。争取和平的人民运动对政治的影响愈来愈大，政治家是不能不考虑到这种情况的。
    因此，美、英、法、苏四国政府首脑会议必须被认为是和平力量的肯定的成就。
    苏、美、英、法四国政府首脑举行了自从一九四五年波茨坦会议以来的第一次会晤，以便共同讨论迫切的国际问题，这件事实本身就有着极为重要的意义。
    在日内瓦会议上，四大国政府首脑彼此之间建立了个人接触，并且就有关国际局势的许多问题交换了意见。无论是正式的会议，或者是会议以外的非正式会谈，都是在合作和互相谅解的精神下进行的，必须满意地指出，会议的所有参加者都表现了争取积极结果的愿望。
    日内瓦四国政府首脑会议能够被列为重大的历史性事件，因为它标志着苏、美、英、法四国关系上的转折点。
      一、日内瓦会议前夕的国际
        局势
    在叙述日内瓦会议的参加者所做的工作以及工作结果之前，必须谈一下这次会议之前的国际局势的特征。
    第二次世界大战结束后的十年来的特征是：过去在反对法西斯主义这一共同敌人的斗争中结成盟友的国家，彼此的关系恶化了。
    苏联在这段时期中，特别是在最近一年半到两年的时期中，采取了一些目的在缓和国际关系上的紧张局势的步骤，希望结束“冷战”，恢复在争取和平和各国人民安全的斗争中的合作。同苏联一道积极为巩固和平而努力的还有中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家。
    不能不看到，最近时期苏联和各爱好和平的国家为巩固和平而作的努力已产生了积极的结果。
    首先应该指出，由于中华人民共和国、苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的主动而达成的朝鲜停战，促成了紧张局势的缓和。这样一来，远东的一个危险的战争温床便被扑灭了。这一个战争温床是蕴藏着扩大战争的威胁的，而这种战争会给世界和平造成种种严重的后果。
    去年在苏联、中华人民共和国、美国、英国和法国五国外长日内瓦会议上，在其他有关国家参加下，达成了停止印度支那的军事行动的协议。印度支那的军事行动的停止是又一个重大事件，它不仅对巩固东南亚的和平，而且对改善整个国际局势都有重大的意义。导致印度支那流血战争停止的一九五四年日内瓦协定，是以承认希望求得完全的民族独立和自由的印度支那人民的合法民族权利为基础的，这一点使它具有尤其重大的意义。
    但是尽管朝鲜和印度支那战争的结束是具有重大意义的，国际局势依然是紧张的。各个国家集团之间仍然存在着互不信任和猜疑，“冷战”气氛继续存在。
    这种情况为进一步改善国际局势和在国际关系中建立信任造成严重的障碍，而国际关系中如果没有信任，持久的或巩固的和平是不能实现的。
    在这方面，有必要详细谈谈在今年五月生效的所谓巴黎协定。人们知道，巴黎协定的主要目标是使西德重新军国主义化，并且使它加入西方国家的军事集团——北大西洋集团和西欧联盟。这些协定为军国主义在西德复活铺平了道路。此外，巴黎协定还要把重新军国主义化的西德变成一些西方国家——这些集团的成员——的军事盟国。整个说来，巴黎协定是针对苏联和各人民民主国家的，是有害于维护欧洲和平的。
    苏联政府不止一次地要求美国、英国和法国政府以及巴黎协定的其他签字国政府注意这样一个事实：这些协定将导致整个欧洲局势的恶化，并将造成一种不可能在按照和平方针重新统一德国的基础上解决德国问题的局势。我们曾指出，在这种情况下，德意志民主共和国不能同参与其他国家的军事集团的重新军国主义化的西德统一起来。
    不幸，苏联的警告那时被当做耳边风。结果，欧洲就产生了一种局势，这种局势已经成为而且可能一直是进一步缓和国际紧张局势与解决国际重大问题的严重障碍和欧洲各国——而且不止是欧洲各国——关系发生纠葛的根源。
    军备竞赛的规模一年比一年扩大，特别是在原子武器和氢武器的制造方面，这也引起各国人民理所当然的惊惶。在过去几年中，各国的军费，尤其是北大西洋公约各签字国的军费有步骤地在增加。
    军备开支增加的情形可以从下列摘自有关国家官方出版物的数字中看出。
    美国的直接军费在一九四八—一九四九年达到一百二十九亿美元，占联邦预算总支出的百分之三十二点六；在一九五三—五四财政年度，这种直接军费增加到四百六十五亿美元，占联邦预算支出的百分之六十八点六。这样，从一九四八年以来，美国军事预算就增加了二倍半以上，它在美国总支出中所占的比重也增加了一倍以上。
    英国的直接军费在一九四八—四九财政年度是七亿六千八百万英镑，占预算支出的百分之二十四点二；在一九五三—五四年，这种直接军费就达到十六亿三千七百万英镑，即占预算总支出的百分之三十八点三。
    在法国，一九四九年的直接军费为二千八百九十亿法郎，即占预算总支出的百分之二三·八；法国一九五四年的直接军费则达到了一万一千九百二十亿法郎，即占预算总支出的百分之三二·五。
    情况既然是这样，苏联自然不得不采取步骤来加强它自己的武装部队。一九五五年的苏联军事费用计划为一千一百二十一亿二千二百万卢布，占预算总支出的百分之二十左右。由于巴黎协定的缔结，苏联和欧洲其他爱好和平的国家不得不在五月十四日缔结了华沙友好合作互助条约，这个条约规定联合它们的力量来保障它们的安全和维持欧洲的和平。
    日益明显，军备的继续扩充使得国际关系中互不信任加剧，使国与国之间更加互相猜疑，使新战争的宣传加紧。这一切就意味着“冷战”继续进行。“冷战”打断了国与国之间的正常的经济联系和其他关系；“冷战”造成的结果是国际贸易上的种种禁令和限制，对各国从事工农业人士、科学家和文化人之间的往来的限制。“冷战”是缓和国际紧张局势，创立必要的国与国之间的信任的障碍。
    远东的形势引起了各国人民的特别关怀。甚至在朝鲜战争停止以后，这个地区的形势仍然是紧张的，这种紧张的形势时时刻刻都具有危险的性质。下面的事实说明了这一点：自古以来的中国领土——台湾岛和其他一些岛屿——实际上被外国军队占领着，这自然是中国人民所不能容忍的。
    苏联政府曾经倡议召开有关国家的会议来解决台湾问题。不幸这种倡议到目前为止还没有产生积极的结果。苏联政府还支持中华人民共和国政府所提出的由中华人民共和国和美国就中美关系上没有解决的问题进行直接谈判的建议。大家知道，现在双方已经开始这种谈判。这些谈判是在有利的条件下举行的。把十一名犯有间谍罪的美国飞行员在他们服刑期满以前就释放的决定，是中华人民共和国方面善意的行动，这不能不对谈判发生有利的影响。
    恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利的问题具有极重大的意义。的确，一定不能把一个大国，而且是联合国安全理事会的一个常任理事国——中华人民共和国，人为地排斥在联合国之外，并且不让它参加对若干国际问题的研究。
    苏联政府认识到，个别国家之间的关系中的紧张局势持续愈久，充满着新战争危险的国际局势就愈加恶化。所以，在国际水平上采取根本措施来缓和局势和恢复国家间的信任是必要的。
    因此，以维护和加强和平的利益为指针的苏联政府，在这方面采取了主动，并且在去年采取了受到爱好和平的各国人民普遍支持的若干重要外交步骤。
    人们不能不承认，苏联政府采取的和平行动已经使国际关系中的紧张局势得到缓和。
    苏联政府五月十日提出的关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和氢武器以及消除新战争威胁的建议，对于缓和国际紧张局势具有极重要的意义。这些建议受到世界广大舆论的欢迎，各地都认为这是对和平的重要贡献。在这些建议的基础上达成必要的协议无疑会在实现持久和平方面起主要的作用。
    对于根据苏联的倡议而获致的奥地利国家条约的缔结这件事情的意义，是无论如何估计也不会过高的。
    由于奥地利问题的解决，奥地利成了一个独立自主的国家，它并且保证实行一个永久中立的政策，这种解决是符合奥地利人民的民族利益和维护欧洲和平的利益的。同时，奥地利问题的顺利解决表明，对维护和平负有主要责任的大国绝没有充分利用一切可能的解决悬而未决的国际问题的机会。
    自然，这个问题的解决加紧了争取解决其他迫切问题的运动。
    应该特别提一提由于苏联政府代表团访问南斯拉夫而引起的苏南关系的转变对和平事业的重大意义。
    在贝尔格莱德举行的会谈，结束了自从一九四八年南斯拉夫和苏联人民间的兄弟般友好和密切合作的关系被人为地中断以后两国间存在着的不正常的和不能容许的局势。直到不久以前一直存在着的苏南关系中的不正常局势，只能对和平的敌人有利。它对两国的切身利益和维护国际和平的利益有很大的损害。这种局势不能继续存在下去，两国政府得出这样的结论：必须根本改善苏南关系。
    今后，苏联和南斯拉夫之间的关系的基础将是承认和平不可分割、尊重主权、独立、领土的不可侵犯和平等，承认并且促进两国人民之间的和平合作，互相尊重和不干涉彼此内政这样一些原则。
    在改善苏南关系方面已经取得的结果使人有一切理由认为：这两个国家已经选择了唯一正确的道路，而且两国政府都非常认真地对待改善和巩固苏联和南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的关系的任务。我们在这个讲台上向我们的南斯拉夫朋友们和南斯拉夫总统铁托同志致敬，并且认为有必要表明，我们党的中央委员会、苏联政府和全体苏联人民将继续努力，以便同兄弟般的南斯拉夫人民沿着共同选择的友好和真诚合作的道路前进。
    有必要再谈一下像印度总理贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁先生访问苏联这样一个事件的重大意义。贾·尼赫鲁先生同苏联政府领袖们之间进行的意见交换和苏印联合声明表明，两国有充分的决心来发展和加强苏联和印度之间已经发展的友好关系。两国对和平斗争的迫切问题的态度是一致的，这对解决亚洲和远东的迫切问题和对缓和世界紧张局势是有重大意义的。
    苏联政府非常重视苏印的合作，认为它是在亚洲、而且不仅是在亚洲争取和平的斗争中的一个重要因素；它认为有必要在将来根据苏印声明中所宣布的、得到爱好和平的各国广泛支持的原则保持这种合作。两国政府领袖间的个人接触的进一步发展无疑地将加强这种合作。
    从对维护和加强和平的关怀出发的苏联政府已经采取了一些可以产生重要的建设性结果的其他重要步骤。具体说来，我说的是苏联政府向德意志联邦共和国政府提出的关于建立外交、贸易和文化关系的建议以及现在正在伦敦举行的苏日谈判。
  大体上，这就是在四大国政府首脑日内瓦会议前夕形成的国际形势。这就是为国际紧张局势带来了某些缓和并且从而为举行日内瓦会议创造了良好的条件的因素。
    二、日内瓦会议和苏联政府的
        建议
    苏联政府是从这样一个前提出发的：四大国政府首脑会议的主要任务应该是进一步缓和国际紧张局势，并且促进在国际关系中建立必要的信任。只有在这样的情况下，才有可能认真谈到解决悬而未决的国际问题。
    根据这个原则，苏联代表团在日内瓦会议一开始就说：苏联代表团认为，会议的目的不是互相指责，而是探讨进一步缓和国际紧张局势和建立国际关系中的信任气氛的方式和方法。我们直率地说，我们到日内瓦来的动机是希望通过共同的努力来寻找解决悬而未决的问题的方法，我们并且表示愿意仔细考虑其他与会者提出来的建议。
    苏联代表团还请美国、英国和法国的政治家注意，苏联代表团并不想低估解决悬而未决的问题，包括亚洲和欧洲问题的道路上的困难，但是如果所有与会者都带着要找到克服困难的方法的意愿来参加会议，这就是会议将产生积极的成果的肯定保证。
    美国、法国、英国和苏联政府首脑在七月十八日第一次会议上的发言中说明了自己对主要的国际问题和会议的任务的看法。同时他们对将要讨论的问题表示了自己的意见。
    会议的所有参加者都主张讨论下列问题：德国问题、裁军问题、欧洲安全问题和关于发展东西方接触的问题。
    遗憾的是，我们提出的关于会议应当讨论亚洲和远东问题的建议没有被接受，虽然，如果正视事实，这些问题的迫切性是很明显的。
    当然，苏联代表团不能同意讨论关于东欧国家情况的问题和“国际共产主义”的问题。我们指出，在这一会议上提出东欧国家情况的问题就是促使我们干涉这些国家的内政。
    而且，大家很明白，这些国家的人民民主制度是人民自己根据他们的自由意志建立起来的。此外，没有人曾经授权我们讨论这些国家的情况。至于“国际共产主义”问题（在某些地方，惯于用它来恫吓天真的人们），我们说，召开日内瓦会议是要讨论国与国之间关系的问题，而不是要讨论各国某些政治党派的活动或者这些党派之间的关系。因此，在政府首脑会议上提出这个问题是决不能被认为是适当的。
    谈到苏联政府提交日内瓦会议讨论的问题的实质，首先应该谈一下与保障欧洲安全有关的问题的建议。
    这个问题的重大意义是明显的。历史经验证明：最残酷的流血和毁灭性战争是在欧洲进行的。第一次、第二次两次世界大战都是在欧洲爆发的，接着蔓延到其他国家和其他洲，给人类带来难以估计的牺牲和物质破坏。这一切说明，建立欧洲巩固的安全体系对普遍和平事业具有如何重大的意义。
    苏联政府过去和现在都认为：缔结全欧条约，也就是像我们所说的建立有所有欧洲国家和美国参加的集体安全体系，是保障欧洲安全最可靠的办法。建立这种安全体系来代替一些欧洲国家反对另一些欧洲国家的军事集团是符合欧洲各国人民的利益的，建立军事集团的政策已经不止一次地把欧洲各国人民推进战争的深渊。
    去年当我们提出这个建议时，某些西方国家向我们说，苏联的建议不合它们的心意，因为这个建议破坏它们为了所谓防御利益而建立的军事集团体系。而且，它们对北大西洋集团的命运表现特别关心，它们硬说北大西洋公约组织只是为了防御目的。鉴于这样一些说法，苏联政府当时决定参加这个组织，因为参加以防御为目的的组织是完全符合我们的利益的。苏联曾经进行具体努力，设法参加北大西洋公约组织，并且就此向北大西洋公约组织的成员国发出照会。但是，我们被正式照会拒绝参加。这不能不引起苏联方面理所当然的忧虑和戒备。显然，北大西洋公约组织的目的是同关于这个组织是防御性质的说法远远不相符的。
    考虑到某些国家的政府不愿意抛弃——至少在目前——他们建立的军事集团，为了促进有关国家之间达成协议，我们在日内瓦会议上提出了关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的新建议。我们建议，把这种安全体系的建立分成两个阶段。
    在第一个阶段中，北大西洋公约、巴黎协定和华沙条约都将仍然有效，而参加这些集团的一切国家，如我们所建议的，应当承担义务：彼此不使用武装力量互相对付，并且只用和平方式来解决它们之间可能发生的一切争端。
    我们的建议还规定，在就裁减军备、禁止原子武器以及就撤退欧洲国家领土上的外国军队等问题达成协议之前，欧洲集体安全的参加国应当承担义务：不采取任何措施来增加他们在欧洲其他国家领土上的武装力量。
    最后，苏联的建议提到：欧洲集体安全的参加国每当情况需要的时候，应当互相磋商，以便不致酿成威胁性的欧洲局势，并且采取一致同意的措施来维持和平。
    由此可见，苏联的建议一方面考虑到了当某些国家的军事集团存在时欧洲所形成的现实情况，另一方面，当这个建议被接受时，又可以保证欧洲国家的和平共处。同时，根据欧洲集体安全条约，这些国家中的任何一个国家在第一阶段除了承担不使用武装力量的义务外，将不承担任何其他的义务。
    这个建议还有这样一种优点：它提供了机会，在某一个时期内来实际考验这个以所有欧洲国家为维护和平而作的共同的、虽然规模是有限的努力为基础的体系。
    在第二个阶段，上述国家自然应当根据相应的条约承担同建立欧洲集体安全体系有关的全部义务。
    根据这一点，北大西洋公约、巴黎协定和华沙条约应该完全地和同时地停止生效，根据这些条约建立起来的集团应该取消，而代之以全欧集体安全体系。
    我们在日内瓦主张，最后在欧洲国家的领土上不应当留有外国军队，并且在这方面要恢复到第二次世界大战以前的情况。我们相信，这种做法是符合欧洲各国人民争取和平和独立生存的愿望，并且完全符合保障欧洲各国人民的安全的任务的。
    我们深信：只有在军事集团的政策结束的时候，只有在所有欧洲国家和美国共同努力争取和平的时候，欧洲国家的真正安全才能够而且一定会得到保障。
    不同的国家过着不同的生活。这些国家的居民中有教徒和非教徒，有共产党人和反共的人，但是他们全体在这一点上是一致的：他们同样地关心维护和巩固和平。如果是这样，那末不应吝惜力量以求实现这一目的。
    我们在提出关于保障全欧安全的具体建议时指出，这个建议并不是解决这个重大任务的唯一方法。我们愿意考虑其他国家提出的在不同程度上符合巩固欧洲安全的任务的建议。关于这一点，苏联代表团在日内瓦会议上就已经声明了。
    苏联代表团明确说明，英国首相安·艾登先生认为可以缔结由比较少数的国家参加的安全公约的想法，是值得注意的。缔结在初期由苏联、美国、英国、法国四大国和其他某些欧洲国家参加的这种公约，可能有积极的意义。在这方面，有一点需要注意的是：这个公约必须考虑到在过去十年中形成了两个德国国家这种在德国存在着的实际情况。我们认为，完全有可能设法使全欧安全的利益同德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的发展的利益这样地结合起来，使之既符合德国人民的利益，又符合普遍和平的利益。
    应当认为，在十月举行的四国外长会议上，将探讨就这个重要问题达成协议的新的可能性。不能认为这种可能性已经没有了。
    谈到这里，有必要提一下我们的另一项关于欧洲安全的建议，这项建议已转交给将在十月举行的四国外长会议考虑。我所指的苏联政府的这项建议是：欧洲现存的各个集团的参加国在全欧安全体系建立之前，应承担彼此不使用武装力量互相对付的义务。用不着说，这项义务不应损害联合国宪章第五十一条所规定的一个国家在遭到武装攻击时进行单独或者集体自卫的权利，关于这一点，我们已在日内瓦声明过了。
    我们认为，要反对这个建议是困难的。的确，我们姑且假设，就缔结保障欧洲安全条约（或者是所有欧洲国家都参加或者是在开始时只有一部分欧洲国家参加）的问题达成协议可能被拖延吧。我们在日内瓦说道：在这种情况下，为什么不能够就这
  一点取得同意：现有的西方军事集团和华沙军事集团的参加者承担不采取武装力量相互攻击这一简单的但是却符合各国人民的最切身利益的义务呢？现有各个集团的参加国在这方面缔结一个条约，无可争辩地将是在建立有效的欧洲安全体系的问题上跨进一大步。
    关于欧洲安全问题，其中包括苏联政府最近提出的建议，没有达成任何最后的协议。但是，由于四国政府首脑交换意见的结果，大家同意应当继续研究这个问题。同时西方三国代表还谈到赞成研究苏联政府提出的关于西方集团和华沙集团之间缔结一个条约的建议。
    我们在日内瓦会议上提出了一个越来越迫切的问题：由四国给予那些希望奉行中立和不参加军事集团和联盟的政策的国家以支持。大家知道，在欧洲、近东和中东的某些国家里，主张实行中立政策的运动日益加强。这种愿望是完全可以理解的，因为从过去的历史中可以知道，奉行中立政策的国家保障了本国人民的安全，并且起了建设性的作用。我们在日内瓦说道，如果希望奉行中立政策的这一个或那一个国家提出关于保障它们的安全和领土不可侵犯的保证问题，苏联将准备同其他国家一起参加这种保证。
    大家知道，苏联已经提出关于奥地利的这种建议，而且四国外长维也纳会议已就苏联、美国、英国和法国四国政府尊重奥地利中立的问题在原则上达成协议。
    我们认为，在日内瓦会议之后，这个问题还是一个迫切的问题，并且值得十分重视。
    在日内瓦会议上，就德国问题交换了意见。应该说明，在会议上，在解决这个总的问题和德国应当朝什么方向发展的问题方面表现了不同的态度。德国将朝着符合维护欧洲和平的要求的方向发展，还是像过去一样沿着复活军国主义和在欧洲中心建立新战争策源地的道路发展，这个问题对欧洲各国人民的安全有极其重大的意义。
    西方三国代表维护规定西德重新军国主义化和把它拉入西方国家军事集团的巴黎协定。同时他们并不讳言，他们并不认为统一后的德国除了加入上述西方集团还有其他道路可走。显然，苏联不会，也不能同意这种观点，因为这种观点不符合欧洲安全，包括苏联的安全的利益，关于这一点，我们不能，而且也没有权利忽视。
    在这方面他们答复我们说，三个西方国家可以同意缔结一个有苏联、美国、英国、法国和统一后的德国五国参加的五国公约，并且同意由这个公约的上述参加国给苏联以“安全保障”。我们回答说，我们希望对给苏联保障这个问题加以明确的澄清。我们说，对一个没有足以保证自己安全的武装部队的小国来说，关于保障的建议是可以理解的。十分明显，对苏联说来，任何这方面的建议都是没有丝毫根据的。
    还应该指出，问题是这种保障是由那些受其他条约和协定的片面军事义务约束的国家向苏联提出的，而这些条约和协定显然是针对苏联和人民民主国家的。
    苏联认为，欧洲安全最可靠的保障首先是建立全欧安全体系，以及防止德国军国主义复活和防止德国变成欧洲新侵略的温床。
    我们在日内瓦陈述了我们对德国问题的看法。我们说，巴黎协定的实施，即西德的重新军国主义化、西德军事潜力的恢复和使西德参加西方国家军事集团，是同统一德国的任务不相容的。
    我们曾经提醒，苏联在早先就已经提起美、英、法三国政府注意，巴黎协定会带来什么后果。
    现在，巴黎协定已经生效，并且正在付诸实施，这就造成了不容忽视的新形势。但是，这同时也意味着，巴黎协定既已存在，德国问题的解决应当遵循另一条不同的道路，即缓和欧洲的国际紧张局势、废除现有的各个国家军事集团和建立有效的欧洲集体安全体系的道路。德意志国家和其他有关国家都应该朝着这个方向努力。
    我们只能满意地指出，西德公众和西德报纸日益坚决和日益频繁地要求德意志联邦共和国政府改变对统一德国问题的政策，因为这个以西德重新军国主义化和使西德加入军事集团为基础的政策排斥了统一德国的可能性。
    德国问题的情形就是这样，这里所谈的是统一德国的外部的、国际的条件。
    可是，不要忘记，在德国本身还有内部条件，这些条件对于决定德国前途的问题也具有重大的意义。
    目前的德国已经不是十年前希特勒统治被粉碎后的初期的德国了。过去十年中，在德国领土上形成了两个独立的德国——德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国，而且这两个共和国都被其他国家承认为主权国家。这两个国家都同其他国家保持着外交和贸易关系，并且都参加了欧洲的各种有关的条约和协定。
    不能不考虑到这一事实：这两个国家中形成了各自不同的社会制度和经济制度。在德意志民主共和国是工人和他们的同盟者——劳动农民和知识分子掌握政权，他们已走上了社会主义建设的道路，并且坚决相信他们所选择的道路是正确的。当德意志民主共和国劳动人民宣称他们不能让自己在上述期间内所获得的成果遭到威胁时，那是完全可以理解的。
    在解决统一德国的问题时，不能不考虑德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的意见。换句话说，这个问题不能在没有德国人自己参加下获得解决。
    所有这一切说明：在当前的国际条件和德国国内条件下，不能用把德国两个部分机械地合并的办法来统一德国。任何这样的企图和计划是不能成功的，因为这些计划和企图没有考虑到现实的情况。在目前的条件下，德国问题的解决只有逐步地通过德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的合作，通过它们实行符合于和平和进步的要求的相互接近来实现。
    在日内瓦，我们在德国问题上没有找到共同的基础。但是，苏联代表团在交换意见的过程中明确地表示了自己的态度，人们期待这次交换意见在今年十月四国外长就日内瓦会议所讨论的各项问题重新会谈时，将有重要的意义。
    苏联政府非常清楚地认识到：外长们在解决德国问题的道路上将会遇到不少的困难，不少的暗礁。这是可以理解的，因为在四国政府首脑会议上已经表现了对于解决德国问题的两种不同的态度。
    但是，关于解决德国问题的困难不应成为外长会议顺利进行的障碍，特别是，它们不能够成为解决外长们必须讨论的关于建立全欧安全体系这一个主要的和基本的问题的障碍。
    裁军问题在日内瓦会议上得到了重视。这一点可以从这一问题本身所具有的意义而得到解释。武装力量的扩充以及军备的空前发展和改善一年比一年具有更大的规模，这引起各国人民对自己前途应有的忧虑。现在特别有必要着重指出这一点，因为原子武器、氢武器以及其他大规模毁灭性武器正在生产和储存中。
    关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的谈判已经进行了将近十年了，大家知道，这些谈判没有收到应有的结果。“冷战”和国与国之间，首先是大国之间的不信任使得最近几年来这种谈判实际上已经陷入僵局。
    苏联政府认为，目前研究裁减军备的问题的主要任务是寻求途径，以便使各国在这一问题上的态度接近起来，以及就裁减常规军备的问题和禁止原子武器的问题达成必要的协议。
    苏联政府在五月十日所提出的关于普遍裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁问题的著名的建议正是符合这个目的的。在这里提一下世界广大公众和欧洲亚洲许多国家对这些建议所采取的积极态度是适宜的，它们恰当地把这些建议称为苏联政府在争取和平和各国人民安全的斗争中的一个重大步骤。
    由于考虑到苏联政府在联合国组织中所提出的这些新建议实际上并没有得到讨论，而美、英、法三国政府也并没有对这些建议表示他们的态度，我国代表团在日内瓦会议上自然首先关心上述政府对这些建议的态度。我们曾经提起注意，苏联同意西方国家关于五大国武装部队水平的建议，那就是：美国、苏联和中华人民共和国的武装部队水平各为从一百万到一百五十万人，法国和英国为六十五万人。在这方面，我们有理由期待西方三国对原子武器问题将采取能够促使大家在这个问题上达成协议的态度。这样，裁军问题整个说来就可以建立在真实的基础上。
    但是，由于考虑到就裁减常规军备和禁止原子武器问题达成协议可能需要相当长的时间，我们还建议，日内瓦会议的参加国现在就保证不首先使用原子武器和氢武器，并且号召其他国家也这样做。
    在苏联五月十日的建议中特别强调要建立一个监督实施裁减军备和禁止原子武器的有效的国际监督体系。
    正如美国总统正当地指出的，每一个裁军计划都归结于监督和视察的问题。这个问题的确是一个十分严重的问题，我们应该寻求互相都可以接受的解决这一个问题的办法。
    苏联政府认为，目前还缺乏建立这样一种国际监督的必要条件，这种国际监督可以享有各国的信任，并且完全符合国际安全的利益。美国政府也同意这一点。美国总统在日内瓦会议前夕——对目前究竟有多大可能性开放美国所有工厂以便进行无限制的视察表示怀疑，这是可以理解的。
    那么怎样办呢？苏联政府认为，建立国际监督以及关于国际监督机构的权力和权利的问题应当同实行缓和国际紧张局势、加强国与国之间的信任的措施以及实行其他有关裁减军备和禁止原子武器的措施密切联系起来加以研究。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔在日内瓦会议上曾提出一项建议，要组织交换苏联和美国之间的军事情报，要在双方领土上互相进行空中摄影。
    人们虽然对这一建议中所表示的要寻求一个解决像国际监督这样一个复杂的问题的办法的愿望表示赞扬，但是同时不能不指出：这一类措施的实际效果是不大的。
    我们在同美国政府领导人的非正式谈话中曾坦率地表示，空中摄影不可能得到预期的结果，因为我们两个国家都有辽阔的幅员，在这一片辽阔的土地上，人们可以把想要隐藏的任何东西都隐藏起来。还应该考虑到这一事实，即：所提出的计划只涉及到两国自己的领土，而对驻在其他国家领土上的武装部队和军事装备则放在一边不谈。
    我们认为，苏联政府在五月十日提出的关于建立国际监督的详尽建议是更现实的和更有效的。这个建议规定在实行裁减军备和禁止原子武器的措施的第一阶段就赋予国际监督机构以广泛的权利和权力。
    苏联政府在它五月十日的建议中提出了一个关于监督的十分重要的方法，就是主张国际监督机构毫不拖延地在相互的基础上，在各有关国家的领土上设立监察所，以便防止一个国家突然地袭击另外一个国家。我们建议这些监察所设在各大港口、铁路枢纽、公路线和飞机场。它们将进行监察，以便不让陆军以及空军和海军进行危险的集中和调动。
    苏联代表团在日内瓦表示它希望毫不迟延地开始削减武装部队的人数和军备的数量。我们建议四大国在这方面作出榜样，在军队中裁减相等于从奥地利境内撤出的军队的数目的人员。苏联政府本着这一建议的精神，在几天前已经决定在十月一日以前把驻在奥地利的苏联军队全部撤回苏联领土，并且在苏联军队的总人数中裁减相等于从奥地利撤出的军队的数目的人员。其他三国采取类似的措施将可以有助于建立国际信任的气氛，并且符合裁减军备的利益。
    我们所有的建议都是为了一个简单明了的目的：争取进一步缓和国际紧张局势，使各国人民摆脱战争恐怖，使他们相信他们能够安心地生活和劳动，为后代造福。
    亿万人民都迫切要求这样作。下面一个事实可以说明这一点：苏联代表团在日内瓦期间，收到了许多国家的各种团体和个人写来的无数信件。在那些日子里，从法国、德国的两部分和其他国家，有几百个代表团到日内瓦来。它们坚决要求结束“冷战”，为人们的和平和安静的生活创造必需的条件。
    自然，我们并不认为，我们能够在五六天的时间内在日内瓦使大家就苏联代表团提出的全部建议达成协议。经验证明，要就这样一些问题达成协议是需要时间的，特别是像缔结关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器、对实现这些措施建立有效的国际监督的国际公约这样一个复杂的问题。因此，我们建议，四国政府首脑把注意力集中在那些他们已经在实质上意见一致或者意见非常接近的问题上。这首先适用于我上面说过的五国军备的水平，解决关于分阶段裁减常规军备和禁止原子武器的问题以及国际监督。我们的出发点是：日内瓦会议如能就裁军方面的某些主要问题达成协议，就会大大有助于进一步研究这个问题和缔结上述的国际公约。
    至于裁军问题的实质部分，决定继续探讨达成协议的通路，在这方面已经给四国外交部长以相应的指示。
    日内瓦会议议程上的第四个问题是发展东西方之间的接触的问题。
    苏联过去和现在一直主张实行广泛的国际合作，全面发展各国之间的经济、科学和文化联系。我们认为，各国之间交换代表团和组织工业、农业、贸易、科学、文化、艺术界人士和社会活动家互相访问是很有好处的。我们也主张发展旅行。
    我们认为苏美两国交换农业代表团是一件好事，并且对围绕着苏联代表团在美国和美国代表团在苏联的访问的那种良好气氛表示满意。
    现在英苏两国之间也已经在谈判发展文化合作的问题。我们希望谈判能获得圆满的结果。还应当指出，在同英国艾登首相的非正式的会谈中，我们从积极的意义上讨论了组织海军舰队和军事代表团互相访问的问题。
    日内瓦会议对东西方接触问题讨论的结果是，四国政府首脑会议根据德·艾森豪威尔总统的建议通过了下述决议：
    “外交部长们应该通过专家研究措施——包括在联合国的机构和专门组织中可能采取的措施在内，这些措施应当能够（甲）促成逐步消除妨碍各国人民之间的自由往来和和平贸易的障碍；（乙）促成对有关国家和人民相互有利的更自由的接触和交流。”
    毫无疑问，这方面的成就会大大促进国际紧张局势的缓和、国与国之间的相互信任的加强和国际合作的发展，而在这方面，就四国之间的关系来说，还远未取得应有的发展。
    我已经说过，苏联政府还建议日内瓦会议讨论亚洲和远东的迫切问题。虽然在有必要在日内瓦会议上正式讨论亚洲和远东的迫切问题一点上没有达成协议，但是，我们同美国、英国和法国代表团的领袖就这些问题非正式地交换了意见。在这些会外的非正式交谈中，谈到了印度支那问题中有关执行一九五四年日内瓦协定的问题，也谈到了美国同中华人民共和国之间的关系的问题。当然，在我们这方面首先注意的是台湾问题和中华人民共和国在联合国的权利的问题。苏联政府希望：这样的交换意见会有助于在符合中国和亚洲其他国家人民的合法权利以及符合维护远东和平的利益的情况下解决这些问题。
    这里有必要着重指出中华人民共和国政府所提出的新的建议的巨大意义，这些建议目的在于解决悬而未决的国际问题和为在亚洲和太平洋地区建立国际信任创造有利的前景。苏联政府完全支持中华人民共和国国务院总理兼外交部长周恩来同志七月三十日在全国人民代表大会第二次会议上关于目前国际形势和中华人民共和国的外交政策的发言中提出的这些建议。
    日内瓦会议最后通过了政府首脑就会议所讨论的全部四项问题，即：欧洲安全问题、德国问题、裁减军备问题和发展东西方接触问题给四国外交部长的指示。这些指示是很重要的，因为它们表达了会议的所有参加者想通过对上述问题的更仔细的研究来找出在各国之间达成必要协议的可能性的愿望。在日内瓦通过的指示的巨大意义，恰恰就在于此。
    三、日内瓦会议的结果，我们的结论
    在总结日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的结果时，必须追述一下，我们在启程去日内瓦之前曾经说过，如果期望在短短几天里能够解决所有的复杂的国际问题，那未免太天真了。只有相信奇迹的人才会这样想。同时，我们也坚决地反对那种毫无根据的悲观看法。
    事实证实了，这种对情况的估计是正确的。现在，谁也不能否认日内瓦会议产生了重大的积极的结果，这种结果将来还会有更大的影响。日内瓦会议在缓和国际关系，首先是大国之间的关系中的紧张状态上，在恢复它们之间必要的信任上起了重要的作用。
    四国政府首脑会议是在合作和相互谅解的气氛中举行的，毫无疑问，它将在国际关系中留下深刻的痕迹，并将有利地影响未来国际关系的发展。四大国政府首脑间个人接触的建立有着重大的意义。
    笼罩着会议的合作精神和相互谅解的愿望是令人愉快的。这一点特别可以在非正式的会晤中感觉出来，这样的会晤使大家有可能就各项问题开诚布公地交换意见。应该特别指出，我们在日内瓦会议上没有遇到过其他的情绪。相反地，大家都在寻求使在会议所讨论的实际问题上的观点协调起来的可能性，虽然在对待所讨论的问题的实质的态度上是存在着分歧的。
    我们同美国、英国和法国的领导者一起弄明白了我们这些国家在所讨论的问题上的共同点，更明确地弄清楚了我们之间意见不同的地方，并且决定继续找寻办法以达成必要的协议。我们不疑怀通过进一步的会谈会有可能克服现存的困难，并且找出根据和平的利益解决悬而未决的问题的方法。
    会议上拟定的给四国外交部长的指示是寻求大家都能接受的决定的结果，在寻求这样的决定的过程中，考虑到了会谈的所有参加者的利益。只有这样才能解决重要的国际问题。“实力地位”政策在日内瓦被弃置一旁了。对这一点我们只能表示欢迎，尤其是因为日内瓦会谈的建设性的精神现在继续对国际关系起着良好的影响。例如，不能不指出，最近一些日子无论在美国，无论在英国，都表现了这种看法，即国与国之间的关系的原则应当是“谈判，而不是武力”，这种看法对今后的外交会谈有着相当重要的意义。
    我们曾经相信，日内瓦会议将产生积极的结果，果然我们没有看错。现在我们相信，只要具有诚意和考虑到所有有关方面的利益，四国今后在讨论和解决悬而未决的国际问题方面可以取得新的积极结果。
    日内瓦会议在世界广泛公众中博得了赞许。各国人民欢迎这次会议的结果，认为这是他们在争取维护和巩固和平的斗争中所作的努力的重要胜利。同时，他们表示决心继续努力，把事业进行到底。总的说来，日内瓦会议的结果可以恰当地被认为是朝着和平和结束“冷战”的方向前进的一个重大步骤。
    各国政府人士也满意地承认日内瓦会议的成就。
    日内瓦会议的参加者美国总统德·艾森豪威尔、英国首相安·艾登和法国总理埃·富尔都就日内瓦会议的结果发表了谈话。必须指出，所有这些谈话都包含着合作和相互谅解的精神，这种精神曾经有助于保证日内瓦会议取得成就，并且展开了进一步加强国与国之间的信任的远景。我们特别欢迎德·艾森豪威尔总统所说的这句话：必须“作出建设性的进展，而不仅仅是重复过去那种无生气的表演，消极的表演”。
    这里应该指出，最近在美国官方人士中逐渐出现一种愿意作出相应的结论以及促使国际关系的正常化的愿望。可以很高兴地说，在美国已经出现了朝着这一方向行动的力量。例如，提一下美国国会参议院外交委员会主席华·乔治的谈话是很适当的，他坚决主张最近召开有中华人民共和国参加的外长会议。乔治先生正当地认为，美国和中国关系的正常化将会保证在缓和远东紧张局势的道路上取得重大的成就。
    值得注意的是，绝大多数的报纸对日内瓦会议的结果都作出良好的评价。
    例如，美国有影响的报纸“纽约时报”写道，在西方爆发冲突的可能性甚至在最高级会议举行以前就已经消失，而由于四大国目前已经建立起来的关系，可以设想，将会尽一切努力，以避免在亚洲发生严重的麻烦。
    发行量很广的英国报纸“世界新闻报”刊载了保守党议员布斯比的一篇文章。布斯比认为，日内瓦会议是全世界道义力量的一个伟大胜利，这种力量今后将对各国政府施以愈来愈大的压力，使它们赞成和平。
    值得注意的是法国“人民报”的下面这一段话：“当然，给外长们的指示并没有解决所提出的问题。但是，作出指示的本身却证明了四大国表现出来的要求和平的意志。我们并不怀有幻想。前面还存在着困难。但是，日内瓦会议已经造成了新的气氛，而这就提供了希望的基础……在日内瓦，停止了冷战，出现了稳固的和平的前景。”
    在日内瓦会议时期，英国首相安·艾登和苏联代表团之间讨论了关于加强两国关系的问题。你们从报纸上知道，安·艾登爵士邀请我和赫鲁晓夫同志访问英国，我们接受了这个邀请。
    已经发表了我们同英国政府一致同意的关于这件事的下列公报：“在日内瓦会议期间，联合王国首相和苏联部长会议主席讨论了关于通过保持他们在日内瓦已经建立起来的个人接触的方法，来巩固他们两国之间的关系的重要性的问题。苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫已经接受了安·艾登爵士关于在明年春天访问联合王国的邀请。”
    苏联政府积极对待英国政府的倡议，因为它相信，发展最高级人员的个人接触将对保持日内瓦会议上所建立的事务合作的气氛有重大意义。
    英国议会一致赞同英国首相安·艾登所宣布的关于苏联领袖将要访问英国的消息。可以希望，苏联最高苏维埃也会一致赞同我们访问英国的决定。
    苏联政府由于主张国家领袖之间的个人接触，并竭力加强苏联和法国之间的关系，已经决定邀请法国总理富尔先生和法国外交部长比内先生在他们认为方便的时候访问苏联。
    我们希望，法国政府将接受这个邀请。
    法国政府领袖的前来苏联和同他们之间的个人接触将有助于苏法两国关系的进一步的有利的发展。
    代表同志们，
    日内瓦会议的结果十分鲜明地证实了苏联政府所执行的目的在于保障各国和平共处的外交政策的正确性。苏联政府依靠全体苏联人民的支持，今后还将沿着这条道路前进。
    苏联、美国、英国和法国四国政府首脑日内瓦会议为恢复我们四国之间的合作奠定了良好的基础，这种合作在第二次世界大战期间，在反对侵略者的共同斗争中曾经有过顺利的发展，但是在战后时期这种合作被破坏了。现在的任务就是，在日内瓦建立起来的真诚的事务接触和互相尊重的基础上发展这种合作。
      参加日内瓦会议的四国为结束“冷战”和获致对迫切的国际问题的一致同意的决定而作的共同努力，是保证世界持久和平的主要条件之一。
    日内瓦会议的结果表明：
    第一、会议肯定地促进了国际紧张局势的进一步缓和，我们并且希望，它将会有助于达到这样一个崇高的目的——建立巩固的和持久的和平。苏联政府将采取一切措施以求达到这一目的。
    第二、四国的政治家在会议期间的个人接触证明是十分有成果的，这种接触的意义并不比正式会谈的意义小。
    苏联政府今后也准备促进发展和加强各国政治家之间的接触。
    第三、日内瓦会议标志着四国，并且不仅是四国之间的关系改善的重要转折的开端。我们希望，这个转折将使“冷战”终止，如果双方表现诚意和真诚的合作愿望的话。
    苏联政府曾经采取过，今后还要采取一切措施以终止“冷战”，消除国际关系中的紧张局势和保证世界持久和平。
    日内瓦会议的结果证明，它给和平事业带来了积极的结果。
    但是，我们还必须找寻办法来解决悬而未决的国际问题，从这个观点来看，定于十月举行的四国外长会议是有重大意义的。
    根据四国政府首脑所制定的指示，外长们要继续考虑欧洲安全问题、德国问题、裁军问题和发展东西方接触的问题，并对这些问题的解决提出有效的建议。外长们在解决这些复杂的国际问题的道路上不可避免地会遇到困难。可是，这些困难不是不可克服的。
    我们希望，只要参加即将举行的外长会议的各方都表现出作为政府首脑会议上的气氛的特征的那种谋求合作和协议的愿望，那末四国外长就会在解决悬而未决的国际问题方面获得进展。
    苏联政府方面将尽一切努力，使即将举行的四国外长会议胜利地解决它所面临的问题。
    在走向国际局势正常化和建立国际间的信任和合作的道路上，已经取得了初步成就。但是，我们不能闭上眼睛不看前面的困难。我们知道，日内瓦会谈仅是巨大而艰巨的工作的开始，它的目的是建立国际间真正的信任和巩固和平。
    不应该忘记，将会有一些势力企图阻挠达到这个目的。这就要求在争取国际和平的斗争中要有坚定不移和顽强的精神。这就要求我们继续加强我们祖国的威力，发展我们的社会主义经济、表现应有的警惕和关怀苏维埃国家的国防力量。
    苏联政府曾尽一切努力为四国政府首脑会议的顺利进行创造有利的条件。苏联政府将不惜一切力量使日内瓦会议的决议得以实现，以有利于普遍和平和安全。苏联政府依靠苏联人民和所有爱好和平的各国人民的有力支持，今后仍将坚持不渝地执行旨在进一步缓和国际紧张局势的政策和为争取世界持久和平而斗争。
