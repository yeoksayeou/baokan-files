    The Chinese People Must Conquer the Yellow River
    Strive to Realize the Millennium-Long Wish

    Editor:

    The Yellow River flows through more than 200 *li* of my county. For many years, the turbulent river water not only cannot be used for irrigation, but also erodes countless fertile loess soil, making "Pinglu not flat," with barren land and ditches everywhere along the river. Last year alone, nearly 2,000 *mu* of滩地 (riverfront land) in Fantan and Shakou townships in our county were washed away; for a century, half the village of Taiyangdu has been at the bottom of the Yellow River. Therefore, harnessing the Yellow River is the millennium-long wish of the people of our county. However, in the old society, this wish could not be realized. At that time, there was a saying in our county: "When柏叶 (cypress leaves) fall and柳叶 (willow leaves) are round, clearing the Yellow River means the sky will collapse." Today, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the millennium-long wish will become a reality. The Yellow River, this "harmful river," will become a beneficial river, serving the socialist construction of the motherland. How can the people of Pinglu, who have suffered so much from the Yellow River, not be overjoyed?

    Sanmenxia is located in the middle of Pinglu and Shanxian counties. The comprehensive project to be built in Sanmenxia is the key to harnessing and developing the Yellow River. The people of Pinglu are infinitely honored and happy to be at the forefront of this great project. Now, the people of our county are determined to do a good job in water and soil conservation, silting up gullies along the mountains, building terraces, and planting trees. When the project starts, we will mobilize 120,000 people to go all out. The people in the reservoir area must, in the spirit of "one household moves, protecting thousands of households," resolutely obey the state plan and relocate according to government instructions. This is the hope of the 80 million people downstream of the Yellow River, and it is our glorious and unshirkable task.

    Do a Good Job and Welcome the Glorious Task of Harnessing the Yellow River

    Editor:

    All the staff of the flood control headquarters and the repair and defense offices and sections along the Yellow River in our province were greatly encouraged after listening to the recorded broadcast of Vice Premier Deng Zihui's "Report on the Comprehensive Plan for Radically Eliminating the Yellow River's Water Disasters and Developing the Yellow River's Water Resources" on July 19. On the morning of the 20th, employees in various places held forums and discussions, and everyone unanimously expressed their determination to use practical actions of doing a good job to welcome this great and glorious task.

    An old technician at the Kaifeng Repair and Defense Office, who has been working on the Yellow River for more than 30 years, said happily: "In the past, during the reactionary rule, which river official ever bothered about harnessing the river? Wasn't everyone just trying to make a fortune from the river? The investigation conducted by the American imperialist investigation team was just a show to deceive the Chinese people. Now, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Yellow River's water disasters will be radically eliminated. I must contribute all my old strength in the future to participate in this glorious cause." Liu Cai (militia captain of the fourth district), Zhang Defu (model dike protector), and the deputy director of the agricultural production cooperative in Gangcun Township, all students of the Kaifeng County Flood Control Technical Training Class, said: "In the past, the Yellow River breached its banks here, and people fled in all directions. In old China, the common people were afraid when they heard of the Yellow River. Now it's different. After the first phase of the project is completed, we will be able to see our dry land turn into rice paddies, new factories built on both sides of the Yellow River, and ships on the river. How can such a major event of transforming nature not make people happy? We must learn technology well, do a good job in flood control, and ensure that the Yellow River does not breach its banks." Song Shuisheng, a rammer worker from Huayuankou, and Tian Jinsheng, an old worker of the engineering team, said: "In the past, the reactionary government dug dikes at Huayuankou to release water and flood the people, washing away half of our homes. Today's government is radically harnessing the Yellow River and benefiting the people. This is truly a great joy for the people of the whole country. We are determined to build the dikes firmly and turn the Yellow River from a 'harmful river' into a 'beneficial river'!"

    Overcome the Water Disasters of the Yellow River Before It is Radically Harnessed

    Editor:

    I felt extremely excited after reading Comrade Deng Zihui's "Report on the Comprehensive Plan for Radically Eliminating the Yellow River's Water Disasters and Developing the Yellow River's Water Resources." I am nearly sixty years old, and I have personally suffered from the disasters of several breaches of the Yellow River. I have fled famine and begged for food. I have been a river worker since I was a child and have traveled all over the north and south banks of the Yellow River in Shandong Province. However, at that time, the reactionary river officials only cared about making money and did not care how much disaster the Yellow River's breaches would bring to the people; they also deceived the people by saying that these disasters were all "ordained by heaven." Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people will use their own strength to overcome "heavenly numbers." How can this not make people feel jubilant?

    Since liberation, the people have become even stronger when fighting against the Yellow River's water disasters. In 1947, I worked at the Lijin Repair and Defense Section of the Yellow River Conservancy Bureau. That year, five serious emergencies appeared in Lijin. Our working conditions were very difficult: during the day, the planes of the Kuomintang reactionaries came to strafe, and at night there were no lighting tools; there was a shortage of both materials (especially stone) and skilled workers. However, we finally overcame all the difficulties and completed the rescue work. This fact made me believe that the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party will one day completely overcome the Yellow River.

    In 1949, the Yellow River experienced a historically rare flood. During that rescue operation, I persisted in working for fourteen consecutive days and nights. When the stone was about to run out, I came up with the idea of using red mud in sacks to replace the stone, rescued the dangerous work, and saved a large amount of stone for the country (equivalent to more than one million catties of autumn grain). Therefore, I was rated as a special-class Yellow River Harnessing Hero and also attended the First National Congress of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers. The Party and the people gave me honor, and I am determined to work harder and make greater achievements in the work of harnessing the Yellow River.

    Today, a great plan has been announced: we will not only prevent the Yellow River from creating disasters again, but also make it benefit us. I believe that the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party are fully capable of completing this plan, and I must dedicate all my strength to this great cause. I guarantee to work with the comrades of the Lijin Repair and Defense Section to conscientiously do a good job in diligent inspection, diligent repair, and water exchange, and strive to overcome all floods that may occur in Lijin before the Yellow River is radically harnessed.

    Willing to Dedicate My Life to Conquering the Yellow River

    Editor:

    I am a member of the Communist Youth League and a surveyor in the Third Topographic Survey Team of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission. This April, our survey team came to the Yellow River to carry out the surveying work for the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub Project. Currently, our team is enthusiastically carrying out a labor competition, striving to complete the task before the end of October, and then go to support the brother team to complete the glorious and arduous topographic surveying task in the Sanmenxia area this year, and provide accurate and reliable data to the design department in a timely manner.

    When I saw Comrade Deng Zihui's "Report on the Comprehensive Plan for Radically Eliminating the Yellow River's Water Disasters and Developing the Yellow River's Water Resources" in the newspaper, I felt unspeakable excitement and joy. The thousands of years of wish of millions of people to harness the Yellow River will finally be realized under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao! For the people of the whole country, especially for the people on both sides of the Yellow River, what a great gospel this is!

    In the great cause of harnessing and developing the Yellow River, I am extremely proud and honored to be able to participate in the construction of the Sanmenxia project and be a reconnaissance soldier. I guarantee to study my profession earnestly and do a good job in surveying. I will strive to study politics and improve my class consciousness, and strive to join the glorious Chinese Communist Party. I am determined to dedicate my youth and my life to the cause of harnessing and developing the Yellow River. On that day, when the Yellow River is tamed to the will of the people and becomes a happy river serving the people, I will say without shame: "I have contributed my strength in this great struggle to transform nature."

    Settle Down and Do a Good Job in Relocation and Resettlement

    Editor:

    After reading Vice Premier Deng Zihui's "Report on the Comprehensive Plan for Radically Eliminating the Yellow River's Water Disasters and Developing the Yellow River's Water Resources," I felt deeply excited and proud, because we are doing an extremely glorious and great undertaking that our predecessors have never done. When the report talked about the relocation of residents in the Sanmenxia Reservoir area, it said: "When the water level reaches 350 meters, it will be necessary to submerge 2 million *mu* of cultivated land and relocate 600,000 residents. Of course, this is completely incomparable to the losses caused by the flooding and breaching of the Yellow River: flooding and breaching will cause loss of life, and the loss of property is even incalculable; relocation is carried out in a planned manner under the leadership and assistance of the people's government, and the government guarantees that immigrants will receive appropriate production conditions and living conditions after arriving at the relocation site. Therefore, in the past, when reservoirs were built or flood storage areas and detention basins were opened, local residents were able to obey the needs of society and the arrangements of the government, and smoothly complete the relocation or temporary relocation plan." I am a person engaged in relocation and resettlement work, and I have participated in the relocation work of the Nanwan Reservoir for nearly three years. I have personally seen that the people's government of the relevant areas has taken very careful and responsible care of the production and living arrangements of the immigrants. The residents who were mobilized to relocate, under the education and assistance of the government, all understood the principle of "one household moves, benefiting thousands of households," and happily transferred to the resettlement area and started their labor life again.

    Our relocation and resettlement work here will be successfully concluded in September. If I can be transferred to the Sanmenxia Reservoir to continue doing relocation work, I will definitely participate in this great and glorious work without hesitation. Because I know that although relocation and resettlement work is hard and difficult, it is also an indispensable part of the entire national construction undertaking, and it is a work related to the long-term interests of the people of the whole country. Being able to settle down and do such work is a manifestation of loving the motherland and loving our great socialist cause.

    Defend the Great Construction Undertaking of the Motherland

    Editor:

    My hometown is in Kaifeng, Henan, only a dozen *li* away from the Yellow River. In my childhood memories, the Yellow River was a terrible harmful river. When it opened its mouth, it would swallow the lives and property of millions of people. I will never forget: In 1938 (when I was only six or seven years old), the Kuomintang reactionary government breached the dike at Huayuankou near Zhengzhou, submerging the land and villages of dozens of counties. Many kind people were swallowed by the flood, and everywhere were disaster victims supporting the old and carrying the young….

    Now, only five years after the founding of the People's Republic of China, a great comprehensive plan for radically eliminating the Yellow River's water disasters and developing the Yellow River's water resources has been put forward to tame the Yellow River and make it serve us and our descendants. As a soldier of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in addition to expressing my enthusiastic support and support with extremely excited feelings, I must also strengthen my study, improve my political awareness, and practice military technology to become an excellent modern national defense force, and strive to liberate our territory Taiwan and defend the great construction undertaking of the motherland!

### 中国人民一定要征服黄河  为实现千年来的愿望而努力

    中国人民一定要征服黄河
    为实现千年来的愿望而努力编辑同志：
    黄河流经我县县境二百多里。多年来，滔滔河水，不但不能用作灌溉，反而冲刷去无数肥沃的黄土，使“平陆不平”，沿河土地贫瘠，遍地是沟。仅仅去年一年，我县范滩、沙口两乡就被水冲去近两千亩滩地；百年来太阳渡半条村成了黄河底子。因此，治理黄河是我县人民千年来的愿望。但是，在旧社会，这个愿望是不能实现的，那时在我县就流传着“柏叶落、柳叶圆，清了黄河塌了天”的说法。今天，在共产党、毛主席的英明领导下，千年来的愿望将变成现实，黄河这条“害河”将变成利河，为祖国的社会主义建设服务。我们深受黄河水害的平陆人民怎么能不欢欣鼓舞？
    三门峡位在平陆和陕县两县的当腰。将要在三门峡修建的综合工程是治理黄河和开发黄河的关键。平陆人民能够站在这一伟大工程的最前列，感到无限光荣和愉快。现在我县人民决心要作好水土保持工作，沿山淤沟滩，修梯田，植树造林。工程开始时，我们要动员十二万人民全力以赴。水库区人民一定要本着“一户搬家，保了千家”的美德，坚决服从国家计划，按照政府指示实行迁移。这是黄河下游八千万人民对我们的希望，也是我们义不容辞的光荣任务。
                    山西省平陆县县长  郭逢恒
    做好工作迎接光荣的治黄任务编辑同志：
    我省沿黄河各防汛指挥部和各修防处、修防段的全体人员，在七月十九日收听了邓子恢副总理“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”的录音广播后，受到很大的鼓舞。二十日上午各地职工分别进行座谈和讨论，大家一致表示坚决要用做好工作的实际行动来迎接这个伟大的光荣的任务。
    开封修防处一位从事治河工作三十多年的老技术人员高兴地说：“过去反动统治时期的河官们，那为治河费过心呢？谁不是为了在河上发洋财呀？美帝国主义考察团进行的考察，还不是装装样子欺骗中国人民。现在在毛主席的英明领导下，黄河水害就要进行根治。我今后一定要把自己所有的老力气贡献出来，参加这个光荣的事业。”开封县防汛技术训练班的学员刘才（四区的乡民兵队长）、张德富（护堤模范）和岗村乡的农业生产合作社副社长都说：过去黄河在咱们这里开口，淹的人们东逃西散，在旧中国，老百姓一听说黄河就害怕。现在不一样了。第一期工程完了之后，我们就能亲眼看到自己的旱地变成水田，黄河两岸修建起新的工厂，河里也有了轮船。这样改造自然的大事情怎么能叫人不高兴呢？我们一定要学好技术，做好防汛工作，保证黄河不溃决。花园口的硪工宋水生和工程队老工人田金盛说：过去反动政府在花园口扒堤放水淹人民，把我们的家园冲走了一半。今天的政府却是根治黄河，造福人民，这真是全国人民的大喜事。我们坚决要把大堤修坚实，让黄河从一条“害河”变成一条“利河”！
                    河南省黄河河务局办公室
    战胜黄河被根治前的水害编辑同志：
    邓子恢同志“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”使我感到无比兴奋。我是将近六十岁的人了，身受过黄河几次决口的灾难，逃过荒，要过饭。我从小就当河工，走遍了山东境内的黄河南北两岸。但是，那时反动派的河官们只管自己发财，不管黄河决口会给人民带来多大的灾难；他们还欺骗人民说这些灾难都是“天数”。现在，在共产党和毛主席的领导下，人民将用自己的力量来战胜“天数”了。这怎能使人不感到欢欣鼓舞呢？
    解放以后，人民在同黄河水害作斗争的时候，就变得更有力量了。一九四七年我在黄河河务局利津修防段工作。那年利津出现了五处严重的险情。我们的工作条件很艰苦：白天有国民党反动派的飞机来扫射，夜晚没有照明工具；既缺少材料（特别是石料），又缺少技术工人。但是，我们终于克服了一切困难，完成了抢修工作。这个事实使我相信，在共产党领导下的中国人民终有一天会完全战胜黄河的。
      一九四九年黄河又出现了历史上少有的洪水。在那次抢修中，我接连十四昼夜坚持工作，在石料快用完的时候想出了用麻袋装红泥代替石头的办法，抢住了险工，并且为国家节省了大批石头（折秋粮一百多万斤）。因此，我被评为特等治黄功臣，还出席了全国第一届工农兵劳动模范代表会议。党和人民给了我荣誉，我决心加倍努力，在治黄工作中做出更大的成绩。
    今天，一个伟大的计划宣布了：我们不但要使黄河不再制造灾难，而且要使它为我们造福。我相信，在共产党领导下的中国人民是完全有力量完成这个计划的，我一定要把所有的力量献给这个伟大的事业。我保证要和利津修防段的同志们一起，认真做好勤查、勤修和换水工作，努力战胜黄河根治前在利津境内可能发生的一切洪水。
                                        于佐堂
    愿为征服黄河献出毕生精力编辑同志：
    我是一个青年团员，是黄河水利委员会第三地形测量队的一个测量工作者。今年四月我们测量队来到了黄河边上，进行三门峡水利枢纽工程的测量工作。目前我们队正热烈开展着劳动竞赛，争取提前在十月底以前完成任务，然后再去支援兄弟队一起完成今年三门区光荣而艰巨的地形测量任务，及时向设计部门提供精确可靠的资料。
    当我在报纸上看到邓子恢同志“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”的时候，我内心有说不出的兴奋和愉快。千百万人民几千年来治黄的愿望，终于要在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下实现了！对于全国人民，特别是对于黄河两岸的人民来说，这该是多大的福音！
    在治理和开发黄河的伟大事业中，我能够参加三门峡工程建设，当一名侦察兵，使我感到无比的骄傲和光荣。我保证要认真钻研业务，做好测量工作。要努力学习政治，提高阶级觉悟，争取参加光荣的中国共产党。我决心把我的青春、把我的毕生精力都献给治理和开发黄河的事业。到那一天，当黄河驯服于人们的意志，成为一条为人民服务的幸福的河流的时候，我将无愧地说：“我曾经在这个改造自然的伟大斗争中献出过自己的力量。”
      黄河水利委员会第三地形测量队技术员  蒋正清
    安心做好迁移安置工作编辑同志：
    读了邓子恢副总理“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”以后，我深深地感到兴奋和自豪，因为我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。报告中谈到三门峡水库区居民的迁移问题的时候说：“在拦蓄的水位达到三百五十公尺的时候，就需要淹没耕地二百万亩，迁移居民六十万人。当然，这同黄河泛滥、决口所造成的损失，是完全不能比较的：泛滥、决口要造成生命的损失，财产的损失更无法计算；迁移由于是在人民政府领导和帮助下有计划地进行的，政府保证移民在到达迁移地点以后得到适当的生产条件和生活条件。因此，过去在修造水库或开放蓄洪区、滞洪区的时候，当地居民都能够服从社会的需要和政府的安置，顺利地完成迁移或临时迁移计划。”我是一个做迁移安置工作的人员，参加南湾水库迁移工作将近三年了。我亲眼看到，有关地区的人民政府对移民生产和生活上的安置，认真负责地照顾得很周到。而被动员迁移的居民，在政府的教育和帮助下，都懂得“一户迁移，千户受益”的道理，愉快地转移到安置区，重新开始自己的劳动生活。
    我们这里的迁移安置工作到九月份就要胜利地结束了，如果能够把我调到三门峡水库继续做迁移工作，我一定毫不踌躇地去参加这个伟大光荣的工作。因为我知道，做迁移安置工作虽然艰苦和困难，但也是国家整个建设事业中不可缺少的一项工作，是有关全国人民长远利益的工作。能够安心做这样的工作，就是热爱祖国、热爱我们伟大的社会主义事业的表现。
              河南信阳专区迁安委员会  郑在禄
    保卫祖国伟大的建设事业编辑同志：
      我的家乡在河南开封，离黄河只有十几里地。在我童年的记忆里，黄河是一条可怕的害河，它张开大口就会吞掉千百万人民的生命和财产。我永远不能忘记：一九三八年（那时我才六七岁）国民党反动政府在郑州附近的花园口决开了堤，淹没了几十个县的土地和村庄，很多善良的人民被大水吞噬了，到处都是扶老携幼的灾民……。
    现在，中华人民共和国成立才五年多，就提出了伟大的根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划，要把黄河驯服，使它为我们及子孙后代服务。作为一个中国人民解放军的战士，我除了用极其兴奋的心情表示热烈拥护和支持外，还要加强学习，提高政治觉悟，练好军事技术，做一个优秀的现代化的国防军，为解放我们的领土台湾，为保卫祖国伟大的建设事业而奋斗！
