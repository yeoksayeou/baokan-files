Xinhua News Agency, 21st. The First National Congress of the First Machinery Trade Union of China has concluded on the 21st after seven days.

The working principles and basic tasks of the First National Machinery Trade Union of China during the First Five-Year Plan, as determined by this congress, are: under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, closely cooperate with the work of the administration, strengthen ties with the masses of workers, enhance the consciousness and organizational level of the masses of workers, organize the masses of workers to master new technologies, widely and deeply carry out labor competitions, strive to increase production, practice strict economy, so as to ensure the completion and strive for over-fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan, and on the basis of developing production, gradually improve the material and cultural life of the masses of workers, and strive for the gradual realization of the country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation.

The meeting conducted in-depth discussions on carrying out labor competitions, strengthening trade union work in capitalist enterprises, improving the political, technical and cultural level of employees, gradually improving the lives of employees, strengthening trade union construction, and giving play to the role of trade union organizations. The meeting believes that in the struggle to realize the Five-Year Plan, widely and deeply carrying out labor competitions and pushing them to a new upsurge is of great significance. According to the situation and characteristics of the machinery industry, the general goal of labor competitions should be to ensure the comprehensive completion of the state plan, and focus on mastering new technologies, ensuring the trial production of new products, completing the variety plan, ensuring product quality, reducing defective products and saving metal. Trade union organizations must attach importance to their significant responsibilities in the specific organization of labor competitions, use a variety of competition forms, and attract more workers, technicians and staff to participate in the competition. In order to achieve the competition goals, trade union organizations must also actively help employees learn and master new technologies, promote advanced experience, carry out mass rationalization proposals and do a good job in mass wages, labor protection and other related work.

The meeting pointed out that most of the larger private factories in the machinery industry have now been jointly operated by public and private sectors. During the First Five-Year Plan, the rest will also be gradually incorporated into the orbit of state capitalism through joint public-private operation, processing orders and other methods. In the process of gradually realizing their socialist transformation, class struggle will inevitably become more acute, and the work foundation of trade unions in private enterprises is relatively weak, and the tasks are quite arduous. Therefore, the meeting particularly emphasized the need to strengthen trade union work in capitalist enterprises and lay the foundation for the socialist transformation of the private machinery industry.

In recent years, the First National Machinery Trade Union of China has made great progress in its organization, and now has established committees in three provinces and twenty cities, and seven thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine grassroots organizations. In order to better undertake the important tasks of the First National Machinery Trade Union of China, the meeting believes that it is also necessary to strengthen the ideological and organizational construction of trade union organizations, earnestly improve leadership style, closely connect with the masses, so as to fully play the role of trade union organizations; at the same time, it is necessary to educate the masses to raise revolutionary vigilance and prevent all sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements.

The congress elected the National Committee of the First National Machinery Trade Union of China. Kang Yonghe, Duan Junyi, Ma Peixun, Zhou Xifeng, Ma Xiaodi and other forty-five people were elected as members of the National Committee of the First National Machinery Trade Union of China, and Sun Wei and other thirteen people were elected as alternate members. The congress also elected seven members of the Funding Review Committee of the First National Machinery Trade Union of China.

The congress approved Kang Yonghe's report to the congress on "Report on the Work of the First National Machinery Trade Union of China", and passed "Several Decisions on Organizational Issues" and "Resolution on Resolutely Eliminating All Counter-Revolutionary Elements."

The congress also passed a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao.

　　中国第一机械工会第一次全国代表大会闭幕
　　确定五年计划期间的工作方针和基本任务
　　新华社二十一日讯　中国第一机械工会第一次全国代表大会进行了七天以后，已在二十一日闭幕。
　　这次大会确定的中国第一机械工会在第一个五年计划期间的工作方针和基本任务是：在中国共产党和中华全国总工会的领导下，密切配合行政的工作，加强和工人群众的联系，提高工人群众的觉悟程度和组织程度，组织工人群众掌握新技术，广泛、深入地开展劳动竞赛，努力增产，厉行节约，以保证完成和力求超额完成第一个五年计划，并在发展生产的基础上，逐步地改善工人群众的物质生活和文化生活，为逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造事业而奋斗。
　　会议就开展劳动竞赛，加强资本主义企业中的工会工作，提高职工的政治、技术和文化水平，逐步地改善职工生活，加强工会建设、发挥工会组织的作用等方面，进行了深入的讨论。会议认为，在实现五年计划的斗争中，广泛地、深入地开展劳动竞赛，并把它推向新的高涨，有着十分重要的意义。根据机械工业的情况和特点，劳动竞赛的总目标应该是保证全面完成国家计划，并着重掌握新技术，保证新产品的试制工作，完成品种计划，保证产品的质量，减少废品和节约金属。工会组织必须重视自己在具体组织劳动竞赛中的重大责任，运用多种多样的竞赛形式，吸引更多的工人、技术人员和职员参加竞赛。为了实现竞赛目标，工会组织还必须积极帮助职工学习和掌握新技术，推广先进经验，开展群众合理化建议并做好群众工资、劳动保护等有关的工作。
    会议指出，目前机械工业中较大的私营工厂多已公私合营。在第一个五年计划期间，其余的也将经过公私合营、加工订货等方式而被逐步纳入国家资本主义的轨道。在逐步实现对它们的社会主义改造的过程中，阶级斗争必将更加尖锐，加以工会在私营企业中的工作基础比较薄弱，任务相当繁重。因此，会议特别强调必须加强资本主义企业中的工会工作，为私营机械工业的社会主义改造建立基础。
    几年来，中国第一机械工会组织有了很大发展，现在已建立有三个省、二十个市的委员会和七千七百八十九个基层组织。为了更好地担负起中国第一机械工会的重大任务，会议认为还必须加强工会组织的思想建设和组织建设，切实地改进领导作风，密切联系群众，以充分发挥工会组织的作用；同时要教育群众提高革命警惕性，防范一切反革命分子的破坏活动。
    这次大会经过选举产生了中国第一机械工会全国委员会。康永和、段君毅、马佩勋、周西风、马小弟等四十五人当选为中国第一机械工会全国委员会的委员，孙纬等十三人当选为候补委员。大会还选出了中国第一机械工会经费审查委员会委员七人。
    大会通过了康永和向大会所作的“关于中国第一机械工会工作的报告”，通过了“关于组织问题的几项决定”和“关于坚决肃清一切反革命分子的决议”。
    大会还通过了给毛主席的致敬电。
