Constantly Educating the People on Revolutionary Vigilance
Zhang Qian

The people's high degree of vigilance is a powerful weapon in our struggle against counter-revolutionaries and a fundamental condition for our victory over the enemy. In order to expose and eliminate all counter-revolutionaries, newspapers must constantly educate the people on revolutionary vigilance and continuously raise their revolutionary vigilance in order to ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction.

Since the large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries in 1951, newspapers have not been consistent in this aspect of propaganda and have been weak and ineffective. Although counter-revolutionaries suffered a great blow in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, a considerable portion of the openly exposed counter-revolutionaries have not been eliminated, and the hidden counter-revolutionaries have not been eliminated by a long way. They concealed themselves and engaged in various sabotage activities using double-dealing tactics. However, many of our newspapers rarely exposed them and rarely used the incidents that had been exposed to raise the vigilance of the broad masses of the people. This has fostered a sense of complacency among the people and given counter-revolutionaries an opportunity to take advantage of. This kind of propaganda situation in the newspapers, in addition to reflecting the shortcomings in actual work, also reflects the newspaper editorial department's weak concept of the enemy's situation and the existence of right-leaning paralysis. After the People's Daily exposed the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, newspapers in various places began to pay attention to strengthening propaganda and education on raising revolutionary vigilance, and gained some experience.

Based on the propaganda situation during this period, the most important thing for newspapers to achieve the purpose of raising the revolutionary vigilance of the masses is to be good at educating everyone to deeply understand the sharpness and complexity of the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries through various specific facts. We know that the more the revolutionary cause advances and the more victorious it becomes, the more despicable and ruthless the revenge and sabotage of the enemies of the revolution will inevitably be. However, our people often forget this law of class struggle and harbor extremely harmful and dangerous feelings of blind optimism, underestimating the enemy and complacency. The task of the newspaper is to constantly awaken people to overcome this right-leaning complacency, telling them that they must never imagine that the struggle between the counter-revolutionaries and us will ease, but will only become more intense and sharp; therefore, we can only resolutely and unremittingly struggle with the counter-revolutionaries and thoroughly eliminate the counter-revolutionaries. Several incidents of counter-revolutionaries carrying out homicides and assassinations recently exposed by Shanghai's Liberation Daily, Shaanxi Daily, and Jiangsu Xinhua Daily sharply and clearly illustrate this truth to the broad masses. In reporting the incident of counter-revolutionary criminal Zhu Yansen attacking and wounding Yue opera actress Xu Ruichun, Liberation Daily fully exposed the counter-revolutionaries' deep-seated hatred for the people. According to newspaper reports, Zhu Yansen and his younger brother Zhu Tongsen were counter-revolutionaries hidden in the Shanghai Xin Xin Yue Opera Troupe to carry out sabotage activities. After Zhu Tongsen was arrested for hiding weapons and committing various evils, Xu Ruichun reported him. Zhu Yansen pretended to be kind and approached Xu Ruichun, making the people in the troupe complacent, and as a result, Zhu Yansen used a pre-hidden dagger to wound Xu Ruichun. After he was arrested for the attack, he said, "I still want to kill people." After exposing the ferocious and vicious faces of the counter-revolutionaries with these vivid facts, Liberation Daily further pointed out to the people that the counter-revolutionaries facing the fate of destruction are not willing to fail and are constantly trying to eliminate us. The incorrigible elements among them will use despicable means against the people like the criminal Zhu Yansen. Therefore, we can only resolutely, thoroughly, and severely suppress the counter-revolutionaries, and only by locking the tiger in a cage or killing it can it no longer eat people. Through these thrilling facts, the newspaper made people deeply understand that in order to protect the interests of the people, we must adopt a firm policy of suppressing the counter-revolutionaries and eliminate all the counter-revolutionaries completely.

To effectively raise the revolutionary vigilance of the masses, newspapers should also reveal the enemy's activity characteristics - double-dealing tactics - through specific facts. After the victory of the people's revolution, the enemy saw that the people's regime had become extremely consolidated, so they covered up their true anti-people faces and adopted a concealed form of struggle; however, our people are often not good at identifying counter-revolutionaries who are active in special circumstances. This has particularly increased the newspaper's responsibility to expose such counter-revolutionary double-dealing tactics. Recently, many newspapers have carried out propaganda exposing the double-dealing tactics of counter-revolutionaries through typical examples. In the article "Accusing A Long, Criticizing Myself" published in Tianjin Daily by Hou Hong'e, people can see how the Hu Feng elements disguised themselves as "friends" and "mentors" of young people, showed so-called "care" for young people, and used various criminal means to win over, win over, and poison young people. The article also uses specific facts to illustrate that Hou Hong'e was taken advantage of by Hu Feng elements due to his personal fame, arrogance, and other bourgeois individualism, and degenerated from a member of the Communist Youth League branch to a pawn in the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. The article "The Lessons from the Criminal Activities of Special Agent Wang Qiuhang" published in Fujian Daily exposed the various hypocritical faces and activities of this special agent through specific facts. In front of politically numb old classmates, he pretended to be progressive and wanted to get close to the revolution in order to gain trust; when he met old cadres who liked to be flattered, he praised them for their "hard work and great achievements" and flattered them in every possible way to get close; when he saw staff who were not active in their work and did not like to study, he used the method of writing notes and year-end appraisals on their behalf and "sharing their worries" by handling accounts on their behalf to obtain internal documents and accounts of the agency. In this way, this special agent took advantage of the political numbness, arrogance, complacency, and comfort-seeking of these people and collected military, transportation, and other information from the troops and a transportation agency. This type of propaganda in the newspapers proved with facts the great harm of the enemy's double-dealing tactics.

In the propaganda exposing the enemy's double-dealing tactics, newspapers should also conduct targeted explanations and education on certain ideological problems or vague understandings existing among the masses. In this way, ideological obstacles to their participation in the struggle can be cleared away. For example, some people once had a perception that the Hu Feng group were all people who wielded pens and were nothing great. In an article entitled "Talking About 'Scholars Rebel, But Cannot Succeed in Three Years'" published in Wenhui Daily, this statement was forcefully refuted. The article listed a resume of the backbone members of the Hu Feng group, citing that they had been special agents, bullies, and had various counter-revolutionary experiences. Finally, they pretended to be progressive and infiltrated our various organs. The article pointed out with facts that they were not "scholars," but a counter-revolutionary gang. Some newspapers also gave popular explanations of vague understandings such as that those who did not kill or set fires were not counter-revolutionaries, that the struggle to eliminate the Hu Feng group was "making a fuss over a trifle," that certain counter-revolutionaries had "talent" and "merit," and why the liberalism and individualism in us would facilitate the activities of counter-revolutionaries. These propagandas will help people to ideologically recognize the strategic characteristics of the current counter-revolutionaries in carrying out double-dealing activities, improve their ability to identify counter-revolutionaries, and strengthen their will to fight.

In order to educate the people to be vigilant, newspapers should not only forcefully expose the enemy, but also pay attention to commending the people's activities in preventing traitors and opposing special agents. At present, our struggle with the counter-revolutionaries has entered a new period of greater concealment, greater complexity, and greater sharpness. It is even more necessary to rely on the masses and to have millions of eyes to monitor the enemy. With the gradual development of the struggle to eliminate all counter-revolutionaries, a large number of activists are also emerging in various places. Therefore, newspapers should put them in a positive and important position for propaganda. The process of their struggle should be reported in the newspapers, and their resourcefulness and courage in the struggle should be introduced. In this way, it is not only an encouragement and driving force for those who are commended, but the broad masses are also most easily infected and attracted by these deeds, thereby increasing their enthusiasm to participate in the struggle and learning the experience of the struggle. In July, China Youth Daily successively published reports on Communist Youth League member Qi Ruilan reporting her counter-revolutionary father, Communist Youth League member Zhang Guifang reporting a counter-revolutionary group plotting a riot, and young hunters catching special agents, etc., and commended the mass prevention of traitors and anti-special agent activities in many ways. Wenhui Daily successively published three reports on young students reporting counter-revolutionaries. Beijing Daily has also recently continuously reported the deeds of activists who have always actively participated in mass public security work. Many similar reports can also be cited. This practice of the newspaper reflects the policy of relying on and mobilizing the masses to fight against hidden counter-revolutionaries, which should be promoted.

In order to make the reports fully reflect the current struggle, newspapers should continue to pay attention to improving the propaganda methods. First of all, newspapers must link up with the local situation and fully explain to the masses through exposing various incidents of counter-revolutionaries carrying out sabotage in the locality how the counter-revolutionaries are carrying out sabotage in their own front, department, and region, and the harm of this sabotage to the revolutionary cause. In the propaganda to eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, Tianjin Daily, Hubei Daily, Changjiang Daily, Nanfang Daily, Jiangsu Xinhua Daily, etc., have carried out a series of exposures of the various anti-Party and anti-people activities carried out by the backbone members of the Hu Feng group in many organs and many aspects of work in the locality. Qingdao Daily also criticized in its editorial the erroneous understanding of some people in the locality who believed that "Qingdao is not Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, or Wuhan, and there will be no Hu Feng elements," and then exposed the sabotage activities of the Hu Feng element Lu Ying at Shandong University. With the deepening of the struggle, some newspapers have also exposed the sabotage activities of other hidden counter-revolutionaries in the locality. For example, Shanxi Daily has successively reported the incidents of counter-revolutionaries infiltrating the Jin Xing Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative to carry out sabotage, the cracking of bandit and special agent reactionary secret societies such as "Great Ming Qing Army," "Red Fortune Tao," and "Middle Tao" in Heshun County, Yanbei Prefecture, and Taiyuan City, and the events of counter-revolutionaries lurking in the Datong Mining Bureau to carry out sabotage. This propaganda method is being widely adopted by newspapers in various places. Secondly, under the current situation of the in-depth development of the struggle and the high enthusiasm of the people's struggle, newspapers should put this propaganda in a prominent and important position to carry out it in a big way. In reporting the incident of the hidden counter-revolutionary Zhu Yansen attacking and wounding Yue opera actress Xu Ruichun, Liberation Daily published the news and the indictment of the procuratorial organs in the headline position on the front page; and successively published two editorials, published reports and articles written by the victims in prominent positions, which also fully reflected the indignation of many readers and the requirements to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries. This concentrated and prominent propaganda just reflects the great enthusiasm of the broad masses to participate in the struggle, and shows their irrepressible indignation at the counter-revolutionaries and their confidence in winning the struggle. Again, newspapers should also use lively and diverse forms to reflect this complex and sharp struggle. Not long ago, Liberation Daily received letters from readers reflecting that rumors were circulating among the citizens that a junior high school girl used toilet paper handed out by a "red hand" extending from the wall in the toilet and died the next day. The newspaper published an investigative report written by a reporter and a photo of the reporter talking with the girl who was rumored to be "dead," and exposed this counter-revolutionary rumor with iron facts. However, some newspapers are still accustomed to publishing the old set of communiqué-style reports, always a few lines of criminals' names, simple crimes, trial results, and so on. From these reports, neither the ferocious and despicable faces of the enemy nor the struggle of the people can be seen. None of this can achieve the effect of educating the people.

Struggling with counter-revolutionaries is a long-term and complex task. Therefore, newspapers should also constantly place the propaganda on raising revolutionary vigilance in an important position. In order to achieve this, the newspaper editorial department must criticize the harmful view that neglects the propaganda of eliminating counter-revolutionaries. Editorial department staff should be constantly educated on revolutionary vigilance to overcome right-leaning complacency. The newspaper editorial department should also give full play to its initiative, maintain close contact with the public security department, organize them to provide information, write articles, and mobilize everyone's strength to improve the newspaper's propaganda work.

    经常地向人民群众进行革命警惕性的教育
    张浅
    人民群众的高度警惕性，是我们同反革命分子作斗争的有力武器，也是我们战胜敌人的基本条件。为了揭露和肃清一切反革命分子，报纸就必须经常地向人民群众进行革命警惕性的教育，不断地提高人民群众的革命警惕性，以保障社会主义建设的顺利进行。
    从一九五一年大规模的镇压反革命运动以后，报纸在这一方面的宣传是很不经常和软弱无力的。反革命分子虽然在镇压反革命运动中受到了极大的打击，但是公开的暴露的反革命分子还有不小的一部分没有肃清，至于暗藏的反革命分子则远没有肃清。他们隐蔽起来，采用两面派的办法进行着各种破坏活动。而我们的许多报纸，却很少加以揭露，也很少通过已经揭露的事件来提高广大人民群众的警惕性。这就助长了人民群众的麻痹情绪，给了反革命分子以可乘之隙。报纸上的这种宣传情况，除反映了实际工作中的缺点外，也反映了报纸编辑部的敌情观念薄弱，存在着右倾麻痹思想。在人民日报揭露胡风反革命集团以后，各地报纸才注意加强了关于提高革命警惕性的宣传教育，并且取得了一些经验。
    根据这一时期的宣传情况来看，报纸要达到提高群众的革命警惕的目的，最重要的是要善于通过各种具体事实，教育大家深刻认识镇压反革命斗争的尖锐性和复杂性。我们知道，革命的事业愈前进、愈胜利，革命的敌人的报复破坏必然愈卑鄙、愈狠毒。而我们的人，却往往忘记了阶级斗争的这一条规律，抱着极端有害和危险的盲目乐观、轻敌麻痹的情绪。报纸的任务就是要经常地唤醒人们克服这种右倾麻痹情绪，告诉他们决不能幻想反革命同我们之间的斗争会缓和下去，而只能是更加激烈尖锐起来；因此我们只有坚决地一刻也不停地同反革命进行斗争，彻底肃清反革命分子。上海解放日报、陕西日报、江苏新华日报最近揭露的几起反革命分子实行凶杀暗害的事件，就尖锐而鲜明地向广大群众说明了这个道理。在报道反革命凶犯朱燕森行凶砍伤越剧演员许瑞春的事件中，解放日报曾经充分地揭露了反革命分子对人民的刻骨的仇恨。据报纸报道，朱燕森和他的胞弟朱桐森，是暗藏在上海新新越剧团进行破坏活动的反革命分子。当朱桐森因暗藏武器多方作恶被许瑞春检举被逮捕之后，朱燕森就伪装和善同许瑞春接近，使这个剧团的人麻痹起来，结果朱燕森就以预藏的凶刀将许瑞春砍伤。他在行凶被逮捕之后，还说“我还要杀人”。解放日报在用这些活生生的事实暴露了反革命分子凶狠恶毒的面目后，进一步向人们指出了：面临着覆灭命运的反革命分子是不甘心失败，也无时无刻不想消灭我们的。其中死不悔改的分子，就会像凶犯朱燕森一样向人民下卑鄙的毒手。因此我们只有坚决地、彻底地、严厉地对反革命加以镇压，把老虎关在笼子里或者打死了，它才不能再吃人。报纸通过这些惊心动魄的事实，使人们深切地懂得，为了保卫人民的利益，对于反革命分子必须采取坚决镇压的方针，必须把全部反革命分子消灭干净。
    要有效地提高群众的革命警惕性，报纸还应该通过具体事实揭露敌人的活动特点——两面派手法。人民革命取得胜利以后，敌人见到人民政权已经极为巩固，他们就把自己反人民的真实面目遮盖起来，采取了隐蔽的斗争方式；而我们的人又往往不善于识别在特殊情况下进行活动的反革命分子。这样，就特别加重了报纸揭露这类反革命两面派手法的责任。最近以来，许多报纸通过典型事例进行了揭露反革命两面派手法的宣传。在天津日报发表的侯红鹅所写的“控诉阿垅，批判自己”的文章中，人们可以看到，胡风分子是怎样伪装成青年的“朋友”和“导师”，表现出对青年的所谓“关怀”，施展了种种争取、笼络和毒害青年的罪恶手段。文章还用具体事实说明，侯红鹅由于他的个人成名、骄傲自大等等资产阶级个人主义思想被胡风分子钻了空子，竟由一个青年团支部委员，堕落成为胡风反革命集团打前锋的爪牙。福建日报发表的“特务王秋航的罪恶活动给我们的教训”一文，通过具体的事实，暴露了这个特务的各种伪善面目和活动的手法。他在政治麻痹的老同学面前，伪装进步和要靠拢革命以取得信任；遇见爱受奉承的老干部，就夸他“劳苦功高”，来百般阿谀奉承求得接近；见到不积极工作、不喜欢学习的工作人员，又用代写笔记和年终鉴定、代对账目“分忧”的方法，拿到了机关内部的文件和账册。就这样，这个特务钻了这些政治麻痹、骄傲自满、贪图安逸的人的空子，搜集到了部队和一个运输机关的军事、运输等等情报。报纸上的这一类宣传，用事实证明了敌人两面派手法的极大的危害性。
    在揭露敌人两面派手法的宣传中，报纸也应该针对群众中存在的某一些思想问题或模糊认识，进行有的放矢的解释和教育。这样就可以扫清他们参加斗争的思想障碍。例如，在一些人当中曾有一种认识，认为胡风集团都是摇笔杆子的，没有什么了不起。文汇报在一篇“谈‘秀才造反，三年不成’”的文章里，就有力地反驳了这种说法。文章列举了胡风集团骨干分子的一张履历表，举出他们曾经作特务、当恶霸，有过种种反革命的经历，最后伪装进步并钻进了我们的各种机关。文章用事实指明他们不是什么“秀才”，而是一个反革命黑帮。还有一些报纸，对于没有杀人放火就不是反革命分子、肃清胡风集团的斗争是“小题大作”、某些反革命分子有“才能”、有“功劳”等等模糊认识，以及为什么我们身上的自由主义、个人主义思想会便利于反革命分子的活动，也进行了通俗的解释。这些宣传，都会帮助人们从思想上认识到目前反革命分子进行两面派活动的策略特点，提高了他们识别反革命的本领，坚定了进行斗争的意志。
    报纸为了教育人民提高警惕，不但要有力地揭露敌人，还应该注意表扬人民群众的防奸反特活动。在目前，我们同反革命分子的斗争已经进入更加隐蔽、更加复杂和尖锐的新时期，就愈加需要依靠群众，愈加需要有千百万双眼睛去监视敌人。在肃清一切反革命分子斗争的逐步开展中，大量的积极分子也正在各地涌现出来。因此报纸应该把他们放在正面的重要的地位加以宣传。应该在报纸上报道他们进行斗争的经过，介绍他们在斗争中的机智和勇敢精神。这样，不仅对被表扬的人是一种鼓舞和推动的力量，而广大群众也最容易受到这些事迹的感染和吸引，从而提高参加斗争的积极性，学到斗争的经验。中国青年报在七月份里曾经连续发表了青年团员齐瑞兰检举反革命父亲，青年团员张桂芳检举阴谋暴动的反革命集团，青年猎手捉特务等等通讯，多方面地表扬了群众性的防奸反特活动。文汇报曾接连发表了三篇青年学生检举反革命分子的通讯。北京日报也在最近连续报道了一贯积极参加群众治安工作的积极分子的事迹。类似的报道还可举出不少。报纸的这种作法，体现了依靠和发动群众对暗藏反革命分子进行斗争的方针，这是应该加以发扬的。
    为使报道能够充分反映当前的斗争，报纸的宣传方式也应该继续注意改进。首先，报纸必须联系当地情况，通过揭露反革命分子在当地进行破坏的各种事件，充分地向群众说明反革命分子怎样在自己的这条战线、这个部门、这个地区进行破坏，以及这种破坏活动对革命事业的危害性。在肃清胡风反革命集团的宣传中，天津日报、湖北日报、长江日报、南方日报、江苏新华日报等都曾对于胡风集团骨干分子在当地许多机关、许多工作方面所进行的种种反党反人民的活动，进行了一系列的揭发。青岛日报还针对当地有些人认为“青岛不是京、津、沪、汉，不会有什么胡风分子”的错误认识，在社论中进行了批判，并在这以后揭露了胡风分子吕荧在山东大学的破坏活动。随着斗争的深入，有些报纸对当地的其他暗藏反革命分子的破坏活动也进行了揭发。例如山西日报先后报道了反革命分子混入金星农林牧生产合作社进行破坏，和顺县、雁北专区、太原市破获“大明清军”、“红福道”、“中道”等匪特反动会道门案件，反革命分子潜伏在大同矿务局进行破坏的事件，等等。这种宣传方式，正广泛地被各地报纸采用着。其次，在当前斗争深入展开和人民群众斗争情绪高涨的形势下，报纸应该把这一宣传放在显著的重要的地位，来大张旗鼓地进行。解放日报在报道暗藏的反革命分子朱燕森行凶砍伤越剧演员许瑞春的事件中，在第一版头条地位，发表了消息和检察机关的起诉书；并先后发表两篇社论，在显著地位刊登了通讯和被害者写的文章，也充分反映了许多读者的义愤和肃清一切暗藏反革命分子的要求。这种集中突出的宣传，正好反映了广大群众参加斗争的极大的热情，表现了他们对反革命分子的不可抑止的义愤和取得斗争胜利的信心。再次，报纸也还应该用活泼多样的形式，来反映这个复杂尖锐的斗争。不久以前解放日报接到读者来信反映，在市民中流传着谣言说，一个初中女学生在厕所中使用了墙上伸出的“红手”递来的草纸，第二天便死了。报纸就登出记者写的调查纪实和记者同这个传说已经“死去”的女学生谈话的照片，用铁的事实揭破了这个反革命谣言。但是有的报纸仍习惯于发表老一套的公报式的报道，总是几行罪犯姓名、简单罪行、审判结果，等等。从这些报道中既看不出敌人凶狠可耻的面目，也看不出人民群众的斗争。这都不能达到教育人民群众的效果。
    同反革命作斗争是一个长期而复杂的任务。因而报纸也应该把关于提高革命警惕性的宣传，经常地放在重要的地位上去。为了做到这一点，报纸编辑部必须批判那种忽视肃清反革命分子宣传的有害的观点。应该向编辑部工作人员经常进行革命警惕性的教育，克服右倾麻痹的思想。报纸编辑部也应该发挥自己的主动精神，密切同公安部门的联系，组织他们供给情况、撰写稿件，发动大家的力量，来提高报纸的这一宣传工作。
