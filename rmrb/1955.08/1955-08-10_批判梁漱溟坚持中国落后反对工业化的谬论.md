Criticizing Liang Shuming's Fallacy of Insisting on China's Backwardness and Opposing Industrialization
Qian Jiaju

For forty years, Liang Shuming has firmly stood on the position of the landlord class, opposing the Chinese revolution, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese people, while touting himself as a "thinker" and "social reformer" (see "The Essentials of Chinese Culture," preface). His "life of labor," engaging in "rural governance," "rural construction," "running for peace talks," "speaking or remaining silent, appearing or withdrawing, advancing or retreating," had only one purpose: to drag the wheel of Chinese history back to the rule of the feudal landlord class. That is, to make the Chinese people forever the subjects of oppression and exploitation by imperialism, the feudal landlord class, and the comprador bourgeoisie. He has his own set of extremely reactionary theoretical system. His arrogance and conceit have reached a crazy and unbelievable degree. For forty years, his reactionary works, from "An Introduction to Indian Philosophy" (1919) to "The Essentials of Chinese Culture" (1949), numbered no less than dozens, large and small. But all these works, are inseparable from their origin, that is, to use his set of extremely absurd theories to "transform" China. He himself boasted that "If we do not come out, what will happen to the people!" He even said extremely arrogantly: "Now I cannot die. If I die, the world will change color, and history will change its course, which is unimaginable (will not happen)." (1942, "Escape from Hong Kong, Sent to Forgive Two Sons"). Until 1949, when the Chinese people's revolution achieved a great victory and the whole country was liberated, he still said in the preface to "The Essentials of Chinese Culture": "As for today, in terms of views and ideas, the deeper I go, the larger the system becomes. Even if I want to ignore what I know and follow others, can I get it!" This preface specifically noted "Shu Ming's own record on the Double Tenth Festival of the thirty-eighth year" (that is, ten days after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949), to show his nostalgia for the already dead "Republic of China" and to show the firmness of his reactionary position.

In the five or six years after liberation, according to Liang Shuming himself, his thinking has begun to change somewhat. But after careful assessment of his words and deeds, we believe that his reactionary position has not changed fundamentally, and his reactionary ideological system has not moved at all. Naturally, today, it is impossible for him to openly promote his "right track" "peasant movement" to "replace the Communist Party" or "abolish the Communist Party." His backer—China's reactionary forces—has fallen. Today, he can only use certain opportunities to vaguely oppose the Communist Party's leadership in leading us on the road to socialist industrialization. Although Liang Shuming himself does not admit that he is opposed to the general task of the country during the transition period, the fact is that his fallacies in some public or private occasions that Chinese "peasants are too bitter" and that industrialization should be carried out more slowly are in essence opposed to socialist industrialization, that is, opposed to the current general task of the country. Therefore, today, when the country has formulated the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy and mobilized the people of the whole country to strive to complete and over fulfill the first five-year plan, it is entirely necessary to criticize Liang Shuming's reactionary theory of insisting on China's backwardness and opposing China's industrialization.

It must be pointed out that Liang Shuming was not only a person who promoted reactionary theories before liberation, but also a person who opposed the Communist Party and the people with practical actions. As he himself said: "However, I have participated in actions since I was a child. I have always liked action and not willing to sit and talk." ("The Essentials of Chinese Culture," preface). From Liang Shuming's words and deeds over the past forty years, it can be seen that he has always been hostile to and resisted progressive and revolutionary elements. He opposed the New Culture Movement in the early "May Fourth" period, he opposed the reorganization of the Kuomintang in 1924, he opposed our revolution taking the path of the Russians, and he opposed our anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, believing that these were "shallowly following the trend." His works, whether it was "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies" published in 1922 or "The Essentials of Chinese Culture" in 1949, repeatedly chewed on the extremely stale remarks of Liang Qichao, Zhang Dongsun, Zhang Junmai, Russell, etc., saying them again and again, quoting them again and again; he ridiculed all new social trends as "vulgar views." But on the other hand, if we say that Liang Shuming's sense of fresh things is slow, it is extremely unfair. On the contrary, Liang Shuming's political sense of smell is very sensitive. After the May Fourth Movement, Chinese advanced intellectuals began to accept Marxism, and the petty-bourgeoisie radicals also rose up to oppose feudal culture. Liang Shuming immediately published his notorious "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," vigorously supporting feudal culture and wanting to use Confucius' feudal culture to save Westerners and Chinese. In 1927, after Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, implemented "party purification," and massacred workers, peasants, and revolutionary youths, Liang Shuming, who believed in the Duke of Zhou and Confucius, opened his mouth with "ethics" and closed his mouth with "friendship," wrote "The Final Awakening of the Chinese National Self-Salvation Movement" and offered Chiang the "great plan to wash away the stain of Europeans and Russians." When Chiang Kai-shek continued to carry out five large-scale "encirclements and suppressions" against the Chinese Red Army from 1930 to 1936, Liang Shuming felt that Chiang Kai-shek's "hard suppression" method was not necessarily effective, so he wrote "The Theory of Rural Construction" from 1932 to 1936, openly proposing that "If you want to eliminate the Communist Party's peasant movement, you must have another kind of peasant movement to replace it." "With this movement (referring to his rural construction movement—author), other peasant movements will not be needed, and the Communist Party can be without it." Even after the Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people to achieve a great victory and the Chinese mainland was completely liberated, he still hurriedly printed his last reactionary work "The Essentials of Chinese Culture" to point out how China's "politics should be on the road and how it should not be on the road." ("The Essentials of Chinese Culture," preface). It can be said that for decades, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang used guns and knives to kill people, while Liang Shuming used pens and articles to kill people. Chiang Kai-shek was in power, and Liang Shuming was in the opposition. In this respect, Liang Shuming and Hu Shi, who opposed the Communist Party and the people, arrived at the same destination by different routes. However, Hu Shi wanted us to wholeheartedly be slaves of imperialism and take the road of colonialism, while Liang Shuming wanted us to wholeheartedly be slaves of the landlord class and take the road of feudal restorationism. Their purpose is common, that is, to forever maintain China's semi-feudal and semi-colonial society and maintain the rule of the feudal landlord, comprador, and bureaucrat bourgeoisie. Liang Shuming and Hu Shi both pretended to be noble "scholars." They would choose the most appropriate time to oppose the Communist Party and help Chiang Kai-shek. They both understood the strategy of "minor criticism and major help" to the Kuomintang reactionaries, and were therefore favored by the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek. Liang Shuming bluntly admitted: "Now we only point out that we and the government are mutually needed, not incompatible. As for our falling into dependence on the regime, there is also no other choice. The first point, to be honest, is because the rural movement itself has no source of wealth. ... In addition to the issue of financial resources, there is also the issue of power. There are many things that cannot be done without borrowing power." ("The Theory of Rural Construction," appendix, page 8). Liang Shuming used the reactionary government of the Kuomintang's "money" and "power" to engage in his rural construction movement. The reactionary faction of the Kuomintang used Liang Shuming's reactionary theory to carry out its deception and麻醉 on the Chinese people. It was indeed "mutually needed" and complemented each other. After liberation, Liang Shuming finally did not run to Taiwan, and the people forgave him on this point, but from Liang Shuming's forty years of reactionary political career, we still see that he has always insisted on China's backwardness and insisted that China should restore the feudal order of landlord rule, which has been the same for forty years without any wavering. In this way, it is not surprising that he still insisted on backwardness and opposed China's socialist industrialization after liberation.

Liang Shuming opposed China's industrialization with his own set of reactionary theories. This set of reactionary theories can be found in the book "The Theory of Rural Construction." He said: "The so-called Chinese construction (or Chinese economic construction) must take the road of rural construction, which means that it must take the road of revitalizing agriculture to trigger industry. In other words, it must start from the revival of the countryside to achieve the success of new social construction." ("The Theory of Rural Construction," page 14)

In fact, "triggering industry from agriculture" cannot industrialize China. It can only make us forever stay in the status of a backward agricultural country. If we say that the development of industry must correspond to the development of agriculture, this is naturally correct. Agriculture supplies industry with the necessary grain and raw materials. If the development of agriculture cannot keep up with the needs of industrial development, or if the balance or disconnection between industrial production and agricultural production is lost, it will greatly increase the difficulty of industrialization. But Liang Shuming's fallacy of "triggering industry from agriculture" is obviously not this meaning. His purpose is to only want agriculture and not industry. First of all, Liang Shuming's so-called "industry" is neither heavy industry nor light industry produced by machines, but some villagers "using their own existing labor to process their own existing raw materials to meet their own needs" (emphasis in the original) of "industry," that is, some processing handicrafts of daily consumer goods. At the same time, the "industry" he advocates is a rural sideline industry nature of "industry" without the participation of the working class ("... China has a dense population and little arable land, so each person cannot get a few acres of land, so farmers must engage in industry"). Therefore, the industry triggered by Liang Shuming from agriculture is neither heavy industry nor even light industry, but only a rural sideline industry nature of handicraft industry. Liang Shuming likes the combination of agriculture and handicraft industry, which is exactly the economic foundation of feudalism.

Why does Liang Shuming not want heavy industry or light industry, but still call himself industrialization? This reason is actually easy to understand. Liang Shuming is fundamentally opposed to anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. The China he envisions is a China ruled by the feudal landlord class and supplying cheap raw materials to imperialism. At that time, didn't Japanese imperialism put forward the slogan of "agricultural China, industrial Japan"? Liang Shuming not only did not express opposition to this, but instead believed that it was a good way out for China. He said: "Originally, we are generally under pressure in international economic competition in agriculture and industry; however, agriculture is different in comparison. On the one hand, it is because industrialized countries are jealous of our industry rising up to compete with him in the market, and they can let us go a step in agriculture (such as the so-called 'agricultural China, industrial Japan,' he hopes that cotton production in North China will be developed, but he does not want textile development, which is one example). The main thing is that agriculture and industry are fundamentally two different things." ("The Theory of Rural Construction," pages 375-376). What are the "two different things"? That is, he believes that industry is easy to be capitalized, agriculture is not easy to be capitalized, industrial technology is easy to progress, and agriculture is not easy to progress. What's wrong with "capitalization" and "technological progress"? Because after capitalization, a new proletariat will be produced, and a "communist revolution" will occur, which Liang Shuming believes is the most terrible and the most unwilling. Therefore, if we think that Liang Shuming only had to retreat to agriculture due to imperialist oppression, then we still do not know Liang Shuming. Liang Shuming is very "grateful" for the oppression of imperialism on us. After saying a lot of reasons why China must be agricultural, he then said a passage that is "very important" in his "heart":

"Imperialism uses unequal treaties and various economic means to compete and oppress China, and to prevent the rise of China's industry and commerce, making China immune to capitalization. This is really a very fortunate thing. I am willing to thank God. I do not deny that they are heavily oppressed, almost to the point of killing us; but it has been easy to embark on the road of industrial capital in the past eighty years, and I am fortunate to be spared. I cannot but say that I eat their gift. In this way, we still have the opportunity to talk about rural construction today. Otherwise, like Russia, forming a half-hearted industrial country is most suitable for the occurrence of a communist revolution; then, we cannot talk about rural construction today, but have to talk about communism!" ("The Theory of Rural Construction," pages 378-379. Emphasis in the original).

This passage is indeed "important." It honestly explains the real reason why Liang Shuming opposes industrialization! It turns out that what he is afraid of is that imperialism will not oppress us, making China's national "industry and commerce rise." What he is afraid of is the abolition of unequal treaties and the overthrow of imperialist rule. In this way, the Chinese proletariat will rise up and take the road of the Russians. He is not only afraid of China taking the road of the Russians, but even afraid of China taking the road of capitalism, because the result of taking the road of capitalism is inevitable to have a "communist revolution." In this way, Liang Shuming's "rural construction" cannot be talked about, that is, the rule of the feudal landlord class will be finished!

In the past, we thought that Liang Shuming only represented the interests of the feudal landlord class. Now we know that this is still underestimating Liang Shuming. He not only represents the feudal landlord class, but also firmly supports imperialist aggression. Here, Liang Shuming also has a very good confession: "International capitalism originally focuses on economic aggression; we have been deeply and long invaded by him, so on the one hand, we suffer more and more losses, and on the other hand, we become more and more dependent on him. It is like smoking opium. The deeper and longer the addiction is, the more injured the body is, and the more inseparable it is from him. Therefore, if he suddenly withdraws his economic means of aggression, we will be greatly panicked and unable to support it; on the contrary, we will beg him, 'Please invade me!'" ("The Final Awakening of the Chinese National Self-Salvation Movement," page 184). Liang Shuming is not only grateful for imperialist aggression, but also wants to "beg" imperialism to continue to invade us. It can be seen that Liang Shuming is not only a spokesman for the feudal landlord class, but also the most loyal supporter of imperialist aggression against China.

Liang Shuming has a special section in "The Theory of Rural Construction" to discuss the "issue of industrialization" ("The Theory of Rural Construction," pages 432-440). He proposes that the development and utilization of natural resources such as coal, iron, oil, hydropower, as well as railways, ships, telecommunications, airplanes, etc., should be "planned and constructed" by the central government. His so-called "central government" is naturally Chiang Kai-shek's central government, as Mr. Wu Jingchao said, his purpose is "to create a material foundation for his stable Nanjing and make him more stable" (see Wu Jingchao's article in People's Daily on July 11). At the same time, we must also point out that Liang Shuming's so-called "planned construction" industry is not carried out after excluding imperialist forces, but is to be carried out with the permission of imperialism. On the one hand, Liang Shuming admitted: "Foreign consular jurisdiction, domestic factory rights, inland river and coastal navigation rights, leased land, ceded land, spheres of influence, etc. If these many shackles are not removed, how can industrial production be revitalized? In addition, those profit sources that are fundamental to industry, such as coal, iron, and oil, are not abundant, but most of them (especially iron) have been stolen by Japan. If they are not recovered, China will have no way to plan industrial construction." ("The Theory of Rural Construction," page 441) In this way, we thought that Liang Shuming was about to draw the correct conclusion that China must engage in industrialization and overthrow imperialist rule. Who knows, Liang Shuming changed his tone and then said: "It is wrong for China to repair war preparations to seek to destroy the enemy. ... In my opinion, China should not think about how to destroy the enemy, but should think about how to make it difficult for the enemy to destroy us, and even how to recover easily after we are destroyed. What is especially important is to adjust internal relations to establish the foundation for coping with the environment. ... That is the rural construction that is being talked about now!" ("The Theory of Rural Construction," page 441, emphasis in the original). That is to say, the issue of overthrowing imperialist rule should not even be thought about. At most, we can seek how not to be easily destroyed under the premise of imperialist aggression. In order to achieve this, the wonderful plan proposed by Liang Shuming is rural construction, that is, the "agricultural China" that maintains the rule of the feudal landlord class. This fully shows how loyal Liang Shuming is to the interests of imperialism. If imperialism wants to exploit China, it always has to go through its agents in the countryside, that is, the feudal landlord class. Liang Shuming's rural construction is precisely to maintain the rule of the feudal landlord class in the countryside for thousands of generations. This is exactly what imperialism does not want to destroy. It can be seen that although Liang Shuming's works also mention "industrialization," in essence, it is to cancel industrialization and to realize the colonialization of "agricultural China" advocated by imperialism!

In this way, we can clearly see the essence of Liang Shuming's "triggering industry from agriculture" and the so-called "issue of industrialization"!

History is developing according to its own laws, not according to Liang Shuming's subjective wishes. The imperialist aggression that Liang Shuming "thanked God" and was "very fortunate" finally disappeared from the Chinese mainland after the Chinese Communist Party's leadership and the long-term struggle of the Chinese people. The feudal order that Liang Shuming painstakingly maintained was also shattered by the Chinese people. Under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people began a great socialist construction. The general task of the state during the transition period was put forward, and the Chinese people steadily advanced towards the goal of socialist industrialization. At this time, Liang Shuming, who represented the interests of the feudal landlord class and other reactionary forces in the old China, was at a loss. At this time, the semi-colonial and semi-feudal society that constituted the material basis of his "theory" had been eliminated, and his backer, the Chinese reactionaries, had also collapsed. He could not bring out the old set of "rural construction theory" of "agricultural China" intact as a reason to oppose socialist industrialization. Therefore, in order to oppose the general line of the transition period put forward by the Chinese Communist Party, he pretended to "sympathize" with the peasants and opposed socialist industrialization on the grounds that "peasants are too bitter." In essence, this is still the reincarnation of his consistent reactionary theory of "triggering industry from agriculture" and "agricultural China"!

What does "peasants are too bitter" mean? If we compare the lives of Chinese peasants after liberation with those before liberation, isn't there a world of difference? In the past five or six years, after land reform, agricultural cooperativization, and the adoption of other measures to develop agricultural production, the lives of peasants have been greatly improved, and the purchasing power of peasants has been greatly increased. This is a fact that everyone has witnessed. Liang Shuming pretended not to see it and reversed black and white, saying that "peasants are too bitter." What is his intention? If "peasants are too bitter" refers to the fact that China's productivity is backward, which makes the general living standards of Chinese peasants still quite low. But isn't this an important theoretical basis for us to realize socialist industrialization? Only socialist industrialization can change the current backward state of China's agriculture. Only socialist industrialization can supply peasants with the necessary agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers. Only socialist industrialization can finally get rid of their poverty and backwardness. The Soviet Union has made peasants infinitely happy by implementing socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization. Isn't this the road that Chinese peasants should take? But Liang Shuming wants to use "peasants are too bitter" to cancel our socialist industrialization and to provoke the close alliance between workers and peasants. At the same time, he also wants to sell his long-outdated and notorious fallacy of "triggering industry from agriculture" and "agricultural China" on the grounds that "peasants are too bitter," attempting to turn the history of China back to the old road of colonialism, semi-colonialism, and semi-feudalism. This is what we must expose.

History will move forward along its own path. Let Liang Shuming's extremely reactionary fallacy be buried forever!

    批判梁漱溟坚持中国落后反对工业化的谬论
    千家驹
    梁漱溟四十年来坚定地站在地主阶级的立场，反对中国革命，反对中国共产党，反对中国人民，却标榜自己是什么“思想家”、“社会改造运动者”（见“中国文化要义”，自序）。他“一生劳攘”，搞什么“村治”、“乡村建设”、“奔走和谈”、“或语或默，或出或处，或进或退”，其目的只有一个，这就是要把中国历史的车轮拖回到封建地主阶级的统治中去，也就是说，要使中国人民永远成为帝国主义、封建地主阶级、买办资产阶级压迫剥削的对象。他有他自己一套极端反动的理论体系，他的狂妄和自高自大达到了疯狂而令人不能置信的程度。四十年来，他的反动著作，从“印度哲学概论”（一九一九）起到“中国文化要义”（一九四九）止，大大小小不下几十本，但所有这些著作，都是万变不离其宗，就是要以他那一套极端荒谬的理论来“改造”中国。他自己吹嘘是“吾曹不出，如苍生何！”甚至极端狂妄地说什么：“现在我不能死，我若死，天地将为之变色，历史将为之改辙，那是不可想像的（不会有的事）。”（一九四二年“香港脱险寄宽恕两儿”）。直到一九四九年，中国人民革命获得伟大胜利，全国解放，他还在“中国文化要义”自序中说：“至于今日，在见解思想上，其所入愈深，其体系滋大，吾虽欲自昧其所知以从他人，其可得乎！”这一篇自序特别注明“三十八年双十节漱溟自记”（即一九四九年中华人民共和国成立后十天），以表明其对已经死亡了的“中华民国”的留恋，以表示其反动立场的坚定不移。
    解放后五六年来，据梁漱溟自己说他的思想已开始有些转变。但我们把他的言论行动仔细估量一下，认为他的反动立场基本上没有改变，他那反动的思想体系更压根儿没有动。自然，在今天，他是不可能再公开地来宣传他的“正轨”的“农民运动”来“替代共产党”或“取消共产党”了，他的靠山——中国的反动势力已经倒了台，他今天只有利用某些机会隐隐约约来反对共产党领导我们走社会主义工业化的道路。尽管梁漱溟自己不承认他是反对国家在过渡时期的总任务的，但事实上他在某些公开或不公开的场合所主张中国“农民太苦”，慢一点搞工业化的谬论，在实质上是反对社会主义工业化，亦即反对当前国家的总任务的。因此，在国家编制了我国发展国民经济第一个五年计划，动员全国人民为完成和超额完成第一个五年计划而奋斗的今天，批判梁漱溟坚持中国落后反对中国工业化的反动理论是完全有必要的。
    必须指出：梁漱溟在解放前不仅是一个宣传反动理论的人，同时是一个以实际行动来反共反人民的人。正如他自己所说：“然我却自幼即参加行动。我一向喜欢行动而不甘于坐谈。”（“中国文化要义”，自序）。从梁漱溟四十年的言行中，可以看出，他对于进步的、革命的因素都是一贯仇视和抗拒，他反对“五四”初期的新文化运动，他反对一九二四年的国民党改组，他反对我国革命走俄国人的路，他反对我们反帝反封建，认为这些都是“随俗浅薄”。他的著作，不管是一九二二年出版的“东西文化及其哲学”，或是一九四九年的“中国文化要义”，都反复地咀嚼梁启超、张东荪、张君劢、罗素等那几句陈腐透顶的陈辞谰调，说了又说，引了又引；他对于新的社会思潮一律讥为“流俗之见”。但另一方面，如果说，梁漱溟对于新鲜事物的感觉迟钝，那都是极不公道的。恰恰相反，梁漱溟的政治嗅觉是十分灵敏的，在五四运动以后，中国先进的知识分子开始接受马克思主义，小资产阶级急进派也起来反对封建文化，梁漱溟就立即发表了他那本臭名远扬的“东西文化及其哲学”，极力拥护封建文化，要拿孔子的封建文化去救西洋人和中国人。在一九二七年蒋介石背叛革命，实行“清党”，大肆屠杀工农群众和革命青年以后，信奉周公孔子，开口“伦理”、闭口“情谊”的梁漱溟却写了“中国民族自救运动之最后觉悟”，向蒋贼献“一洗旧染于欧人俄人者之污”的大计。在一九三○年到一九三六年，蒋介石对中国红军继续进行五次大“围剿”的时候，梁漱溟觉得蒋介石那种“硬剿”的办法不见得收效，于是在一九三二——一九三六年写成“乡村建设理论”，公开提出“要想消除共产党的农民运动，必须另有一种农民运动起来替代才可以。”“有此运动（指他的乡村建设运动——笔者）而后其他的农民运动才用不着，共产党才可以没有。”甚至在中国共产党领导中国人民已经取得了伟大胜利，中国大陆完全解放之后，他还要把他那最后一部反动著作“中国文化要义”急急忙忙印出来，来指点中国“政治上如何是路，如何不是路”。（“中国文化要义”，自序）。可以说，几十年来，蒋介石匪帮用枪用刀来杀人，梁漱溟则用笔用文章来杀人，蒋介石在朝，梁漱溟在野，就这一点来说，梁漱溟和胡适一样，反共反人民，殊途同归。不过胡适是要我们死心塌地做帝国主义的奴才，走殖民地的路，梁漱溟是要我们死心塌地做地主阶级的奴隶，走封建复古主义的路。他们的目的是共通的，就是要永远维持中国半封建半殖民地社会，维持封建地主买办官僚资产阶级的统治。梁漱溟和胡适都伪装成清高的“学者”，他们会选择最适当的时机来反对共产党，为蒋介石帮凶。他们对国民党反动派都懂得“小骂大帮忙”的策略，因而为蒋介石反动政府所宠爱。梁漱溟直认不讳地说：“现在只点明我们与政府是彼此相需的，而非不相容的。至于我们落到依附政权，则亦有不得不然者。头一点，说句最老实的话，就是因为乡村运动自己没有财源。……除了为财源问题，还有权力问题。有不少的事，都非借政权不办的。”（“乡村建设理论”，附录、页八）。梁漱溟利用国民党反动政府的“钱”和“权”来搞他的乡村建设运动，国民党反动派利用梁漱溟的反动理论来进行其对中国人民的欺骗与麻醉，的确是“彼此相需”，相得益彰。解放以后，梁漱溟终算没有跑到台湾去，人民亦从这一点上宽恕了他，但从梁漱溟四十年的反动政治生涯中，我们终还是看出他一贯坚持中国落后，坚持中国应恢复封建秩序的地主统治，那真是四十年如一日，没有丝毫动摇过。这样他在解放后仍然坚持落后，反对中国走社会主义工业化的道路，自是不足为怪的了。
    梁漱溟反对中国工业化，是有他一套反动理论的。这套反动理论见于“乡村建设理论”一书中。他说：“所谓中国建设（或云中国经济建设）必走乡村建设之路者，就是说必走振兴农业以引发工业的路。换言之，必从复兴农村入手，以达于新社会建设的成功。”（“乡村建设理论”，页十四）
    事实上呢，“从农业引发工业”，这决不能使中国工业化，只能使我们永远停留于落后的农业国家的地位。如果说，发展工业必须相应地发展农业，这自然是正确的，农业供应工业以所必需的粮食和原料，如果农业的发展赶不上工业发展的需要，或者工业生产和农业生产之间失去了平衡或脱节，那就会大大增加工业化的困难。但梁漱溟所谓“以农业引发工业”的谬论显然也不是这个意思，他的目的是只要农业不要工业，首先就是梁漱溟的所谓“工业”，既不是重工业，也不是机器生产的轻工业而是一些乡下人“以自己现成的劳力加工于自己现成的原料，满足自己的需要”（着重点原著所有）的“工业”，也就是一些日用消费品的加工手工业。同时他所提倡的“工业”是没有工人阶级参加的农村副业性质的“工业”（“……中国人口繁密，可耕地少，每人匀不到几亩地，所以非使农民兼事工业不可”）。所以梁漱溟从农业引发的工业既不是重工业，甚至也不是轻工业，而只是一种农村副业性质的手工业。梁漱溟喜欢的是农业和手工业的结合，这恰巧就是封建主义的经济基础。
    梁漱溟为什么既不要重工业，也不要轻工业，而还自称是什么工业化呢？这理由其实是很容易了解的，梁漱溟是根本反对反帝反封建的，他理想中的中国就是为封建地主阶级统治、为帝国主义供应廉价原料的中国。当时日本帝国主义者不正提出了“农业中国工业日本”的口号吗？梁漱溟于此非但不表示反对，反而认为那倒是中国的一条好出路，他说：“本来国际经济竞争我们农业工业是普遍都感受压迫的；然而比较上农业终不同些。这一面固由工业先进国嫉妒我们工业起来和他争回市场，而于农业尚可放过我们一步（如所谓“农业中国、工业日本”，他希望华北棉产发达，而不愿意纺织发达，即其一例）外，主要的还是为农业与工业根本是两回事。”（“乡村建设理论”，页三七五—三七六）。是怎样的“两回事”呢？就是他认为工业容易资本主义化，农业不容易资本主义化，工业技术容易进步，农业不容易进步。“资本主义化”“技术进步”，有什么不好呢？因为资本主义化以后，就会产生新兴的无产阶级，就会发生“共产革命”，而这是梁漱溟认为最可怕的，也是梁漱溟所最不愿意的。所以如果我们认为梁漱溟只是由于帝国主义压迫才不得不退让到农业上去，那还是不为知梁漱溟者。梁漱溟是十分“感谢”帝国主义对我们的压迫的，他在说了一大段中国为什么非农业不可的理由之后，接着说了一段在他“心中却是很重要的”话：
    “帝国主义以不平等条约和种种经济手段，对于中国的竞争压迫，杜绝了中国工商业的兴起，使中国免于资本主义化，这真是非常庆幸之事，我愿谢天谢地。我不否认他们重重压迫，几乎致我们死命；可是八十年来极容易走上工业资本之路的，竟得幸而免，不能不说是食他们之赐。这样，才留给我们今天讲乡村建设的机会。要不然，像俄国那样，形成一个半通不通的工业国家，最适宜于发生共产革命；那么，我们今天就不能讲乡村建设，而得讲共产主义了！”（“乡村建设理论”，页三七八——三七九。着重点原著所有）。
    这一段话的确“重要”，它把梁漱溟为什么反对工业化的真正理由老老实实讲出来了！原来他害怕的就是帝国主义不来压迫我们，使中国的民族“工商业兴起”，他所怕的就是不平等条约的取消，帝国主义统治被推翻，这样中国的无产阶级起来便要走俄国人的道路了。他不但害怕中国走俄国人的路，甚至也害怕中国走资本主义的路，因为走资本主义的路的结果，就难免发生“共产革命”。这样，梁漱溟的“乡村建设”就讲不成，也就是说，封建地主阶级的统治要完蛋了！
    过去我们还以为梁漱溟仅仅是代表封建地主阶级的利益，现在我们才知道这还是小看梁漱溟了。他不仅是代表封建地主阶级，同时还坚决地拥护帝国主义的侵略。这里，梁漱溟也有一段很好的自白：“国际资本主义原重在经济的侵略；我们受他侵略既深且久，固一面吃亏愈大，而一面亦愈依赖于他。好似吸鸦片烟一般，烟瘾愈深且久，身体愈伤，而愈离不了他。所以他若将其经济侵略手段一旦骤然撤回，我们便大起恐慌，支撑不住；反倒要哀恳于他‘请你还是侵略我罢！’”（“中国民族自救运动之最后觉悟”，页一八四）。梁漱溟对于帝国主义的侵略不仅是感激涕零，而且还要“哀恳”帝国主义继续侵略我们。由此可见，梁漱溟不仅是封建地主阶级的代言人，同时又是帝国主义侵略中国最忠实的拥护者。
    梁漱溟在“乡村建设理论”中专有一节是谈“工业化问题”的，（“乡村建设理论”页四三二—四四○）提出开发利用天然富源如煤、铁、石油、水力，还有铁路、轮船、电信、飞机之类要由中央来“统筹建设”，他的所谓“中央”自然是蒋介石中央，正如吴景超先生所说其目的是“要替他的稳固的南京创造一个物质基础，使他更稳固些”
  （见人民日报七月十一日吴景超文）。同时，我们还必须指出，梁漱溟的所谓“统筹建设”的工业不是在把帝国主义势力排除出去之后进行的，而是要在帝国主义允许之下进行的。一方面，梁漱溟承认：“外国的领事裁判权、国内设厂权、内河及沿海航行权、租借地、割让地、势力范围等等。这许多的枷锁不除去，工业生产又如何能振兴？还有适才说到为工业之根本的那些利源如煤铁石油等，本不丰富，乃竟大部（尤其铁之一项）被窃夺于日本。假使不收回，中国直无法谋工业建设。”（“乡村建设理论”，页四四一）这样我们以为梁漱溟快要得出中国要从事工业化，非推翻帝国主义的统治不可的正确结论了，孰知不然，梁漱溟笔锋一转，接着说：“中国若修战备以求摧敌，那是错误。……在我认为中国不应当在如何摧敌处着想，而应当在如何让敌人不容易毁灭我们处着想，乃至在我们被毁后如何容易恢复上着想。尤其要紧的是在调整内部关系以树立应付环境的根本，……那就是当下讲的乡村建设！”（“乡村建设理论”，页四四一，着重点原著所有）。这就是说，关于推翻帝国主义统治问题是连想也不应当想的，充其量我们只能在帝国主义侵略的前提下求得如何不容易被毁灭。为要做到这一点，梁漱溟提出来的锦囊妙计就是乡村建设，也就是维持封建地主阶级统治的“农业中国”。这一点充分表明梁漱溟是如何忠实于帝国主义利益的。帝国主义要剥削中国，它总要通过中国在农村的代理人即封建地主阶级，梁漱溟的乡村建设正是要保持封建地主阶级在农村中千秋万世的统治，这正是帝国主义所不愿意毁灭的。由此可见，梁漱溟的著作中虽然也提到“工业化”，实质上是要取消工业化，是要实现帝国主义所提倡的“农业中国”的殖民地化！
    这样，我们对于梁漱溟的“从农业引发工业”以及所谓“工业化问题”的本质就看得清清楚楚了！
    历史是按照自己的规律而不是依照梁漱溟的主观愿望而发展的，梁漱溟所“谢天谢地”“非常庆幸”的帝国主义侵略，终于在中国共产党领导和经过中国人民的长期奋斗之后，从中国大陆上消失了，梁漱溟苦心孤诣保持的封建秩序也被中国人民所粉碎了。中国人民在伟大的中国共产党领导之下开始进行了伟大的社会主义建设。国家过渡时期总任务提出来了，中国人民向着社会主义工业化的目标稳步前进。这时候，代表旧中国封建地主阶级及其他反动势力利益的梁漱溟，茫然无所措手足了。这时候，构成他的“理论”的物质基础的半殖民地半封建社会已被消灭，他的靠山中国反动派也已经倒台，他反对社会主义工业化的理由，总不能把那“农业中国”的“乡村建设理论”的老一套原封不动端了出来。于是，为着反对中国共产党提出的过渡时期的总路线，他就装出一副“同情”农民的样子，以“农民太苦”为理由来反对社会主义工业化了，实质上这还是他那一贯的以“农业引发工业”“农业中国”的反动理论的借尸还魂！
    什么叫“农民太苦”呢？如果把解放后中国农民的生活和解放前相比较，难道不是有天渊之别么？五六年来，经过了土地改革，农业合作化以及采取了其他发展农业生产的措施以后，农民的生活已经大大改善，农民的购买力已经大大提高，这是我们每个人有目共睹的事实，梁漱溟却装着看不见，颠倒黑白地说什么“农民太苦”，这是居心何在呢？如果说“农民太苦”指的是我国生产力落后，因而使我国农民一般的生活水平还是相当低下。但这不正是我们应该实现社会主义工业化的一个重要的理论根据吗？只有社会主义工业化才能改变我国农业目前这样落后的状态，只有社会主义工业化才能供应农民以所必需的农业机械和化学肥料，也只有社会主义工业化才能使农民最后摆脱他们贫穷和落后的地位。苏联由于实行了社会主义工业化和农业集体化而使农民获得无限幸福，不正是我国农民所应该走的道路吗？但梁漱溟却想以“农民太苦”来取消我们的社会主义工业化，来挑拨工农之间的亲密联盟。同时他还想以“农民太苦”为理由来贩卖他那早已过了时的臭名远扬的“以农业引发工业”的“农业中国”的谬论，企图把中国历史扭转到殖民地、半殖民地、半封建的老路上去。这是我们所必须揭发的。
    历史将沿着自己的道路前进，让梁漱溟那种极端反动的谬论，永远埋葬了吧！
