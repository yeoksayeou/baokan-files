　　The Birth of a Brick and Tile Kiln
　　Lian Ru'en
　　One day in early June, I visited the "Fujian" Brick and Tile Kiln outside the West Gate of Jincheng County, Shanxi Province. This brick and tile kiln was established last year by some comrades who had returned from demobilization from the Air Force, Navy, Artillery, Tank, and Infantry units. Not long ago, these comrades were still on the front lines of defending the motherland in the southwestern border and along the coast of the East China Sea. Now, for the needs of national construction and to create a better and happier new life in the future, they have returned to their hometowns after demobilization and have begun selfless labor on a new production front.
　　The "Fujian" Brick and Tile Kiln officially started work on April 22nd this year, and has now expanded from seven to eleven people, including seven Communist Party members and one Communist Youth League member. These comrades were mostly platoon and squad leaders in the army, and almost all of them had been awarded merit at least once during the War of Liberation and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. The manager of the brick and tile kiln, Communist Party member Zhang Dejun, was the deputy company commander of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army before his demobilization. He was awarded five major and minor merits in the famous battles of Qingfengdian, the liberation of Taiyuan, the march into Northwest China, and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Now, like he was at the front, he wholeheartedly leads everyone in creating new honors on the new front.
　　The People's Government's care for demobilized soldiers is meticulous. Although the population density is high here and land is scarce, and most people rely on small-scale handicraft industries to make a living, the People's Government still tries every means to settle and help demobilized soldiers find employment. From 1952 to the present, all seventy-nine demobilized soldiers who have returned to the Chengguan District of Jincheng County have been properly settled. In addition to organizing twenty-three people to participate in agricultural production, the government has introduced and organized the remaining fifty-six people without land or with little land to participate in handicraft production cooperatives, railway survey teams, factories and mines, and other production departments. In particular, the government has shown great concern for the twenty-three comrades who have no houses, little land, or are homeless, not only allocating houses to them, but also spending more than 1,200 yuan to repair their houses and provide them with various utensils, so that they could establish a home as soon as they returned. Comrade Zhang Dejun said:
　　"We feel warmth everywhere we go after returning to our hometowns. The government cares for us so much, and the cadres and neighbors are also very enthusiastic, helping us borrow furniture, repair houses, and asking about our well-being, treating us as their own relatives. We must carry forward the glorious tradition of revolutionary soldiers and actively engage in production."
　　Because of the enthusiastic care of the government and the people, their enthusiasm for participating in national construction has been further enhanced. As soon as they returned to their hometowns, they actively looked for ways to produce. Comrade Du Ruanwang, the accountant of the brick and tile kiln, after returning to his hometown in 1953, before he had time to settle down, first looked for ways to produce. Under the advocacy and help of the People's Government, he overcame various difficulties and organized five unemployed demobilized soldiers, each contributing 100 yuan of production subsidies to set up a chicken farm. In just over a year, the number of chickens increased from 100 to 700. In 1954, he was selected as the county's "Special Grade Demobilized Soldier Model." Later, although the chicken farm was forced to close due to chicken plague, they were not discouraged and continued to actively look for ways to produce. When they learned that urban construction had begun here and a large number of bricks and tiles were needed, and when they realized that setting up this brick and tile kiln could not only solve the current production and employment problems for some comrades, but also prepare the way for production for comrades who would return after demobilization in the future, their enthusiasm and determination became even greater. In February of this year, with the specific help and guidance of government staff, Zhang Dejun and Du Ruanwang were responsible for organizing seven demobilized soldiers, including Shi Shuihai and He Shengjie, to start preparing for the construction of the brick and tile kiln. In order to find a kiln site, they traveled back and forth more than fifty times to Hexi, Gezhenzhuang, Nanyao, and Nanzhai in more than a month. After the kiln site was selected, each person contributed 40 yuan of subsidies as production shares.
　　Brick and tile production was completely unfamiliar to them. Among the seven people, except for Xu Lianshan, a 48-year-old Communist Party member who had learned a little about making bricks and tiles twenty years ago, the rest were all novices. Moreover, the entire production process, such as digging soil, mixing mud, making blanks, shaping tiles, loading the kiln, and delivering goods, was all done by hand under the hot sun. But these difficulties did not diminish their determination and confidence. The sense of responsibility of Communist Party members, the instructions of the leaders of the troops, the concern of the People's Government, and the love of the villagers constantly encouraged them. They said: In the past, in the war, we marched and fought battles, without eating for three days or sleeping for half a month, and still defeated the enemy. Compared with the comrades liberating Taiwan and building the Kangzang Highway, what are these difficulties! They worked hard to study, and in just six days they had a preliminary grasp of the technology of making bricks and tiles. At first, one person could make 100 to 200 brick and tile blanks a day, and after working for a day, their backs ached and their legs were sore. Some comrades had blisters on their palms that could not be stretched out. The next day, they would scald them with hot water and continue working. Communist Party member Wang Zhanxian did not complain when he lost a fingernail. Zhang Dejun did not say a word when he cut the sole of his foot while treading mud. They overcame difficulties and moved forward. Now, the highest record has reached 700 brick blanks per person per day, and they strictly pay attention to specifications and quality.
　　From April 22nd to the end of May, in just over a month, they had already produced two kilns of finished products, supplying 24,500 bricks and 3,100 tiles for urban construction. These bricks and tiles are of good color, strong, and all meet the specifications. They have now signed a contract with the county insurance company for 60,000 bricks and 28,000 tiles, and have formulated a full-year production plan, expecting to produce eighteen kilns of finished products this year, totaling 288,000 bricks. After deducting costs, national taxes, public welfare funds, and accumulation funds, each person can earn more than 1.20 yuan per day.
　　In order to commend their spirit of overcoming difficulties and actively participating in production, the Jincheng County People's Committee organized more than 30 demobilized soldiers, village staff, and representatives of the masses in the Chengguan District to visit here when the first kiln of finished products was produced on May 16th, and presented them with a banner embroidered with "Continue to carry forward the excellent tradition of the revolution and contribute your strength to national construction." On June 4th, Deputy County Chief Liang Guanglin led the heads of various units, carrying banners, books, etc., to the construction site to comfort them.
　　The People's Government's earnest concern for demobilized soldiers deeply moved them. Xu Lianshan said: "As soon as I came back, the People's Government gave me a house and helped us set up this brick and tile kiln, solving our employment and production problems. I am very happy in my heart. Although I am 48 years old, I still have the determination and confidence to work with my comrades to make greater achievements in the new position, to respond to the care of the Party and the higher authorities for us, and to contribute my share to national construction." Zhang Dejun said: "We people used to graze cattle and sheep for landlords and wealthy people, working as coolies and living a life worse than cattle and horses. In the evil old society, hunger and famine forced our families to ruin and death. Today, under the leadership of the Party, we have re-established happy families. In the process of building the kiln, Fan Yimin, the district civil affairs assistant, Wang Hongxin, the secretary, and Chang Runting, the civil affairs section of the county, treated our affairs as their own, running around many times to find kiln sites for us, and summoned the comrades of the handicraft production cooperative to give us many guidance in business and organization. When the finished products were produced, they promptly introduced us to sales channels, and came to see how we were doing every few days and if there were any problems. We ourselves have not done enough, and we are far from the requirements of the higher authorities for us. In the future, we must strive to turn to the handicraft brick and tile cooperative under the leadership of the government, and actively unite all demobilized soldiers to create greater achievements on the new front."
　　Now they have established a Party group on the kiln, strengthened political life, and established learning life system, labor discipline and financial management system. Although these are not perfect enough, in the future, under the guidance of the Party and the government, they will gradually move onto the right track, so that this brick and tile kiln can play a greater role in the socialist construction of the motherland.

　　一座砖瓦窑的诞生
　　连如恩
    六月上旬的一天，我访问了山西省晋城县西门外“复建”砖瓦窑。这个砖瓦窑是去年从空军、海军、炮兵、坦克、步兵部队中复员回来的一部分同志创设起来的一座手工业生产砖瓦窑。参加生产的这些同志，不久以前还在西南边疆、东海沿岸的保卫祖国的岗位上，现在为了祖国建设的需要，为了创造未来的美好幸福的新生活，他们复员回到家乡，在新的生产战线上开始了忘我的劳动。
    “复建”砖瓦窑是今年四月二十二日正式开工的，现在已经由七个人扩大到十一人，其中有七个共产党员，一个青年团员。这些同志原先大都是部队上的班、排级干部，在解放战争和抗美援朝战争中几乎都立过一次到数次功。砖瓦窑的经理共产党员张德俊，复员以前是志愿军某部的副连长。他在有名的大战清风店、解放太原、进军大西北和抗美援朝战争中先后立过大小功五次，现在他又像在前方一样全心全意地领导着大家在新的战线上创造新的荣誉。
    人民政府对复员军人的关怀是无微不至的。尽管这里人稠地窄，大部分人都是靠小手工业维持生活，但是人民政府仍想尽一切办法来安置和帮助复员军人生产就业。从一九五二年到现在，回到晋城县城关区的七十九名复员军人，都受到了妥善的安置。政府除组织二十三人参加了农业生产外，对无地少地的五十六人分别介绍和组织他们参加了手工业生产合作社、铁路勘察队、厂矿以及其他生产部门。特别是对其中二十三名没房少地和无家可归的同志，更是关怀备至，不仅分配给他们房子，而且拿出一千二百多元为他们修补房屋和置办了各种用具，使他们一回来便建立了家务。张德俊同志说：
  “我们回到家乡，到处都感到温暖，政府对我们这样关怀，干部和街坊邻居也非常热情，帮助我们借家具，修补房子，问寒问暖，把我们当作自己的亲人。我们一定要发扬革命军人的光荣传统，积极生产。”
    因为政府和人民群众的热情关怀，他们参加祖国建设的积极性更加提高，他们一回到家乡就积极寻找生产门路。砖瓦窑会计杜软旺同志在一九五三年回乡后还没来得及安家，就先找生产门路，在人民政府的倡导和帮助下，克服了各种困难，组织了五个没有职业的复员军人，每人拿出一百元生产补助金搞起了一座养鸡场。一年多的时间由一百只鸡增加到七百只鸡，一九五四年曾被选为全县的“特等复员军人模范”。后来养鸡场虽因闹鸡瘟被迫停办，但是他们并没有灰心，他们仍在积极寻找生产门路。当他们知道这里已经开始了城市建设、即需大批砖瓦的时候，当他们了解到搞起这座砖瓦窑不仅可以解决当前一部分同志的生产就业问题，而且可以为今后复员回来的同志准备好生产门路的时候，他们情绪更高了，决心更大了。今年二月间在政府工作人员的具体帮助和指导下，由张德俊、杜软旺负责，组织了时水孩、贺生杰等七名复员军人开始筹建砖瓦窑。为了寻找窑址，他们在一个多月内往返河西、圪针庄、南窑、南寨等处五十多次。窑址选好后，每人拿出了四十元补助金作为生产股金。
    砖瓦生产对他们来说完全是一件陌生的工作。七个人当中除去四十八岁的共产党员徐连山一人在二十年前学过一点做砖瓦的手艺外，其余的人都是门外汉。而且生产的全部过程，如起土、调泥、托坯、捏瓦、装窑出货，都是在炎热的太阳下用两只手来做。但这些困难并没有降低他们的决心和信心。共产党员的责任感，部队首长的嘱咐，人民政府的关怀，乡亲们的热爱，时刻鼓舞着他们。他们说：过去在战争中咱们行军、打仗，三天不吃饭，半月不睡觉还照样打败敌人。比起解放台湾和修筑康藏公路的战友，这算什么困难！他们苦心钻研，仅仅六天的时间便初步掌握了做砖瓦的技术。起初一人一天可做一百到二百块砖瓦坯，干一天活累得腰疼腿酸。有的同志手掌磨起血泡，伸展不开，第二天用热水烫一烫，又继续干下去。共产党员王占先，磨掉了一个指甲没有叫苦，张德俊在踩泥中划破了脚心没有吭气。他们战胜困难前进，现在最高纪录已经达到一人一天做七百块砖坯，并且严格注意了规格和质量。
    从四月二十二日到五月下旬，仅一个多月时间，他们已经做出了两窑成品，为城市建设供应了二万四千五百块砖和三千一百块瓦。这些砖瓦颜色好，也结实，并且都合规格。现在他们已经同县保险公司订了六万块砖和二万八千块瓦的合同，并订出全年生产计划，预计今年要出成品十八窑，共二十八万八千块砖。除去成本、国税、公益金、公积金外，每人每天可收入一元二角多钱。
    晋城县人民委员会为了表扬他们这种克服困难、积极参加生产的精神，在五月十六日第一窑成品出厂时，组织了城关区的三十多名复员军人、村工作人员、群众代表到这里参观，并把一面绣有
  “继续发扬革命的优良传统，为祖国建设贡献自己的力量”的锦旗赠给他们。六月四日副县长梁广林率领各单位负责人携带锦旗、书籍等，又到工地上去慰问他们。
    人民政府对复员军人的殷切关怀深深地感动了他们。徐连山说：“我一回来人民政府就给了我房子，并帮助我们搞起这座砖瓦窑，解决了我们就业和生产的问题，我心里十分高兴。我虽然四十八岁了，我还有决心有信心和同志们一起，在新的岗位上做出更大成绩来，回答党和上级对我们的关怀，为祖国建设尽自己的一份力量。”张德俊说：“我们这些人，过去给地主老财放牛放羊当苦工，过着牛马不如的生活，在万恶的旧社会里，饥饿和灾荒逼得我们家破人亡，今天在党的领导下，我们又重新建立了美满的家庭。在建窑过程中，区民政助理员范一民，秘书王鸿信、县民政科常润廷同志把我们的事情当成他们自己的事情，多次为我们奔跑寻找窑场，并召集手工业生产合作社的同志在业务和组织方面对我们作了多次的指导。成品出厂时又及时为我们介绍了销路，隔几天还要来看看搞得怎样了，有没有问题。我们自己做得还很不够，离上级对我们的要求还很远。今后我们一定要在政府领导下争取在
  一年内转向手工业砖瓦合作社，并积极团结所有的复员军人，在新的战线上创造更大的成绩。”
    现在他们已经在窑上建立了党的小组，加强了政治生活，并建立了学习生活制度、劳动纪律和财务管理制度。这些虽还不够十分完善，但今后在党和政府的指导下，将会逐步走向正轨，使这座砖瓦窑在祖国的社会主义建设中发挥更多的作用。
