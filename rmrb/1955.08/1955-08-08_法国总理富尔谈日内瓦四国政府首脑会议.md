He pointed out that the Geneva Conference will continue at the foreign minister level in order to find positive solutions to various issues.

    Faure said that the meetings of the heads of state of the four countries and their foreign ministers made it possible to have direct contact and frank talks, and the importance of all this should not be underestimated. He also said that the Geneva Conference has been "expanded" due to the Sino-U.S. talks currently being held there.

    Faure finally announced that he and Foreign Minister Pinay had accepted the invitation from the Soviet government to visit the Soviet Union. The date of the visit will be in early October.
