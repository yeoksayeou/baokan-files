　　Regarding Rationed Grain Supply in Cities and Towns and Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas
　　State Council Announces Two Provisional Measures
    This dispatch. The State Council of the People's Republic of China today issued an order, announcing the "Provisional Measures for Rationed Grain Supply in Cities and Towns" and the "Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" (see page two of today's newspaper), requiring all parts of the country to conscientiously implement them. These two provisional measures were passed at the 17th plenary session of the State Council on August 5th. This is a major measure in our country's grain work.
    The general principles of the "Provisional Measures for Rationed Grain Supply in Cities and Towns" first explain the purpose of formulating these measures, which is "to implement the policy of planned grain supply, improve the grain supply system in cities and towns, promote grain conservation, and ensure the rational distribution of grain, in order to facilitate the progress of national economic construction." The measures make detailed provisions for residents' rations, grain for industrial and commercial use, grain-based products, and grain for feed.
    The "Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" are formulated in order to "implement the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, realize the institutionalization of unified purchase and sale of grain in rural areas, further enhance farmers' enthusiasm for production, increase grain production, promote grain conservation, and ensure the needs of the state and the people for grain, in order to facilitate socialist construction." This measure makes detailed provisions for fixed production, fixed purchase, fixed sales, and adjustments to production, purchase, and sales figures.
    After the plenary session of the State Council passed these two provisional measures, all localities actively carried out preparatory work for the implementation of these two measures.

　　关于市镇粮食定量供应和农村粮食统购统销
　　国务院公布两项暂行办法
    本报讯　中华人民共和国国务院今天发布命令，公布“市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”和“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”（见今天本报第二版），要求全国各地认真贯彻执行。这两个暂行办法是在八月五日经国务院全体会议第十七次会议通过的。这是我国粮食工作的重大措施。
    “市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”的总则中，首先说明了制定这个办法的目的，是为了“贯彻粮食计划供应政策，健全市镇粮食供应制度，提倡粮食节约，保证粮食的合理分配，以利于国家经济建设的进行”。办法中对居民口粮、工商行业用粮和粮食制成品以及饲料用粮等，都作出了详细规定。
    “农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”的制定，是为了“贯彻粮食统购统销政策，实现农村粮食统购统销的制度化，进一步提高农民生产积极性，增加粮食生产，提倡粮食节约，保证国家和人民对粮食的需要，以利于社会主义建设”。这个办法中，对定产、定购、定销以及产购销数字的调整等，都作出了详细的规定。
    在国务院全体会议通过这两项暂行办法后，各地为这两项办法的实施，积极进行了准备工作。
