Several Important Tasks in the Current Labor Force Allocation
Director of the Labor Force Allocation Department of the Ministry of Labor, Xing Yuhong

    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, labor departments at all levels have established labor force allocation work. At that time, there were two situations: on the one hand, old China left us with many unemployed people, and on the other hand, the country needed a large amount of labor to engage in the restoration of the national economy. In order to accelerate the recovery and development of the national economy and correspondingly solve the problem of gradually employing unemployed people, labor departments at all levels have organized more than a million unemployed workers to take up posts in national production and construction. After the start of the first five-year plan for national economic construction, the labor department, on the premise of serving the country's socialist industrialization, first strengthened the allocation of construction workers, began to organize and plan the supply of labor needed for construction projects, and paid attention to opposing idling waste and unreasonable use of labor, thereby improving labor productivity and saving a lot of money for the country.

    However, there are still many serious shortcomings and problems in the allocation and use of labor. In construction and installation enterprises, due to the increase of mechanized construction, the improvement of production technology, and the increase of labor productivity, especially due to the blind increase of workers by many units, in 1954, some cities experienced a surplus of fixed construction workers and urban temporary workers, which became more prominent in 1955. For example, Shanghai has a surplus of more than 49,000 construction workers. Tianjin, Zhejiang, Liaoning and other regions also have large surpluses. In some coastal cities without key construction projects, a considerable number of unemployed workers and surplus labor have not been fully utilized. But at the same time, some key construction cities in the Northwest and North China need a large amount of labor, but have not been properly resolved. In 1954, although the labor department transferred a number of skilled workers, young students and other staff from some areas with surplus labor, this work was not done well due to insufficient understanding of the importance of organizing and planning the allocation of surplus labor to support key construction projects. Some recruitment units are unwilling to use urban unemployed and jobless people, which has also brought difficulties to the allocation of labor. More seriously, some units randomly recruit workers in rural areas, and some areas even regard rural labor as the main source of allocating workers, especially construction workers, which has affected agricultural production and the development of agricultural cooperation, and has also affected the employment of some unemployed workers.

    The phenomenon of bloated enterprise institutions, overstaffing, and unreasonable use of labor is also very serious. According to the preliminary staffing of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the surplus personnel account for about 25 percent of the total number of employees. The number of personnel that can be cut from the Kailuan Coal Mine is nearly 20 percent of the total number of employees. The number of personnel that can be cut from the Jilin Paper Mill accounts for 22 percent of the total number of employees. In many factories, mines and basic construction units, the proportion of administrative and management personnel is too large. Taking six industrial ministries as an example, in the third quarter of 1954, the proportion of non-industrial production personnel accounted for 16.9 percent of all enterprise personnel. At the same time, the growth rate of non-production personnel exceeded the growth rate of production workers. Comparing the third quarter with the first quarter, the number of production personnel increased by 2 percent, while the number of non-industrial production personnel increased by 14 percent. Skilled workers are lacking nationwide, but some joint state-private and private hardware machinery factories in Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shenyang and other cities have accumulated many skilled workers due to unreasonable labor organization or insufficient production tasks. The Beijing Local State-owned Fire Equipment Factory and a state-owned machine tool factory also have 20 to 30 percent surplus skilled workers. Some enterprises have too many skilled workers, which affects the promotion of workers and apprentices, the implementation of piece-rate wages and the improvement of production efficiency. There are also individual units that recruit a large number of skilled workers even though they are not urgently needed, so that the skilled workers have no work for a long time after arriving at the factory, and some have to do rough work. However, some newly built, expanded and operational enterprises lack a large number of skilled workers and cannot be supplemented in time.

    Based on the above situation, the main task of the current labor allocation work should be to strengthen labor management, overcome waste, and properly handle the surplus personnel in enterprises and the surplus labor in cities, and gradually achieve the rational use of labor.

    Labor departments at all levels should urge enterprises and departments to earnestly check the use of existing labor in the spirit of streamlining and saving, and eliminate the phenomenon of disregarding production costs, large-scale idling and random waste of labor. All enterprises should formulate staffing standards and establish a staffing system in accordance with the principle of streamlining. In the future, old factories and mines should increase production without increasing manpower, and when new factories and mines increase workers, the enterprise authorities must first draw from the old factories and mines under their jurisdiction. If it is not enough, it can be drawn from other departments with the approval of the labor department. If it is still not enough, it can be recruited with approval. In this way, the phenomenon of blindly increasing personnel and randomly recruiting workers can be eliminated.

    Attach importance to and do a good job in labor force balance planning, and allocate labor in a planned way. All enterprises should fully estimate the various factors that may improve labor productivity according to production tasks and labor plans, and formulate the labor force balance plan of the unit in accordance with the principle of rational use and saving labor. In the future, when enterprises recruit new workers, or when enterprise authorities allocate workers in their subordinate enterprises, they should do so in accordance with the approved labor plan and labor force balance plan, and strictly abide by the allocation system and laws. Labor departments at all levels should supply the labor needed by various enterprises according to the distribution of labor resources and the degree of importance and urgency. Due to the seasonality and temporality of construction engineering construction, and due to the large variability of engineering tasks, in order to avoid the disconnection between the labor demand plan and the construction operation plan, all construction enterprises should promptly modify and supplement the labor force balance plan and labor demand plan along with the changes in the construction plan, and submit them to the local labor department for application and allocation. In order to adapt to the special circumstances of the allocation of construction workers, the labor department should promptly solve the problem of labor idling and shortage between construction units, and should strengthen the quarterly and monthly labor force balance plan system to ensure the needs of key construction units for labor and reduce idling waste.

    Labor departments at all levels should assist enterprises in properly handling surplus personnel. When handling surplus personnel, enterprises must transfer a part of the backbone with good health, political reliability and good technology for newly built and expanded enterprises, and try to organize and transport entire shifts of production workers for newly built and expanded enterprises. Enterprises must start from the overall situation when transferring workers. It is wrong to be too strict, but it is also wrong to only transfer the weak and not the good. The enterprise authorities and labor departments must conduct timely supervision and inspection of this work. Surplus personnel with promising training should be sent to technical schools and technical schools for study as needed. For those who cannot be handled temporarily, shift training should be organized for resettlement and handling. For the old, weak, sick and disabled personnel who have lost their labor force and cannot continue to work, they should be resettled separately in accordance with the labor insurance regulations and retirement methods.

    In the process of labor allocation, surplus fixed construction workers and registered temporary construction workers should be properly resettled according to their respective situations. For this reason, the competent authorities of various construction enterprises should transfer the construction engineering companies with few or no engineering tasks to key construction areas. The labor department should also try to allocate the temporary workers needed by various construction enterprises from cities with few or no engineering tasks, and try to help the workers settle down locally. In order to solve the unemployment and semi-unemployment problems of construction workers more, it is recommended that construction enterprises can change the one-shift system to a two-shift system, which can accommodate more workers on the one hand, and avoid the phenomenon of rushing to work in the tight construction stage on the other hand. Those who have a home in the countryside and have land should be mobilized to return to their hometown for production. According to the survey, the proportion of farmers flowing into the city among temporary workers is very large. For example, in Hangzhou, among 4,299 construction workers, 2,825 have homes and fields in their original籍貫. There are more than 22,000 temporary workers in Tianjin, of which 12,000 have household registration in the city, and the rest are mostly flowing in from rural areas. However, when mobilizing them to return to their hometown for production, we must maintain close contact with the county and district administrative organs, and make proper arrangements according to different situations, so as to avoid their re-influx into the city. In some areas, conditional immigration can be carried out to mobilize them to reclaim land for production. For example, Hangzhou has mobilized 2,500 people to reclaim barren mountains and sea silt, and Fujian is preparing to mobilize 20,000 people to go to the old revolutionary base areas, which can not only reduce the burden on the city, but also increase the country's grain production. In short, all localities should use all favorable conditions to assist temporary workers in finding ways to make a living according to different situations, and give appropriate relief to those who are really in difficulty.

    It is necessary to organize and plan the transfer of surplus labor in some cities, especially skilled workers and temporary construction workers, to support key construction cities. Enterprises that are not suitable for continued production in the local area can move factory equipment and workers to new construction areas. It is understood that some private machinery industries in some cities have insufficient production tasks, while some key construction areas need some small machinery factories and subsidiary factories. Therefore, the labor department should actively cooperate with relevant departments to carry out this work. When allocating skilled workers from some cities to key projects and key factories and mines to participate in production, the labor department should not only strive to do a good job in allocation, but also properly solve problems such as wages and benefits. Service industries should also be systematically transferred and relocated from some cities according to the needs of key construction cities. When factories recruit apprentices and technical schools recruit students, they should try to recruit from demobilized construction soldiers, junior and senior primary school graduates who have failed to enter higher education, and out-of-school youths in cities with surplus labor.

    The task of allocation work in 1955 is arduous and arduous. In order to accomplish this task, the labor department must continue to strengthen the allocation work: it is necessary to strengthen planning and statistics work, strictly control and grasp the enterprise's demand plan and labor distribution, and frequently analyze and study the demand plan and labor distribution; it is necessary to strengthen the specific organization of labor allocation between enterprise authorities and between regions, timely check the progress of allocation work, and solve various difficult problems encountered in allocation work; under the leadership and support of party committees at all levels, we must maintain close cooperation with relevant enterprises and trade unions, and always pay attention to learning business and summarizing work experience; Finally, we must strengthen the education of workers and staff in abiding by the government's transfer orders, mobilize them to go to the posts they need, and contribute their strength to the construction of socialism.

    当前劳动力调配的几项重要工作
    劳动部劳动力调配司司长　邢予洪
    自中华人民共和国成立时起，各级劳动部门即建立了劳动力调配工作。当时面对两种情况：一方面旧中国给我们遗留下了很多失业的人员，另一方面，国家又需要大量的劳动力来从事国民经济的恢复工作。为了加速国民经济的恢复和发展、相应地解决失业人员逐步就业问题，各级劳动部门曾组织了百多万失业工人走上了国家生产建设的岗位。国家经济建设第一个五年计划开始后，劳动部门在为国家社会主义工业化服务的前提下，首先加强了对建筑工人的调配工作，开始有组织有计划地供应建筑工程所需要的劳动力，并注意了反对窝工浪费和使用劳动力的不合理现象，从而提高了劳动生产率，为国家节约了大量资金。
    但是，目前在劳动力调配和使用方面仍有很多严重的缺点和问题。在建筑安装企业中，由于增加了机械化施工，改进了生产技术，提高了劳动生产率，特别是由于许多单位盲目增加工人，一九五四年某些城市中就出现了建筑固定工人和城市临时工人过剩现象，到一九五五年更为突出。如上海市就多余建筑工人四万九千多人。天津、浙江、辽宁等地区也有大量剩余。在某些没有重点建设的沿海城市中，还有相当数量的失业工人和剩余劳动力没有得到充分利用。但和这同时，西北、华北某些重点建设城市需要大量的劳动力，却未能得到妥善的解决。一九五四年，劳动部门虽然从某些劳动力过剩地区调出了一部分技术工人、青年学生及其他工作人员，但由于对有组织有计划地调配剩余劳动力支援重点建设的重要意义认识不足，这件工作做得很不好。有些招工单位不愿用城市失业和无业人员，也给劳动力调配工作带来了困难。更严重的是有些单位随意到农村乱招工人，有些地区甚至把农村劳动力作为调配工人特别是调配建筑工人的主要来源，以致影响了农业生产和农业合作化的开展，也影响了某些失业工人的就业。
    某些企业机构臃肿、人浮于事、劳动力使用不合理的现象目前也很严重。石景山钢铁厂初步定员的结果，编余的人员约占全体职工总数的百分之二十五。开滦煤矿可编余的人员几达全体职工百分之二十。吉林造纸厂可编余人员占全体职工百分之二十二。有不少厂矿企业和基本建设单位行政管理人员的比重过大。以六个工业部为例，一九五四年第三季度非工业生产人员占全部企业人员的比重为百分之十六点九。同时非生产人员增长的速度超过了生产工人增长的速度。以第三季度同第一季度比较，生产人员增长百分之二，而非工业生产人员则增长了百分之十四。技术工人在全国范围内说来是缺乏的，但上海、天津、南京、沈阳等市有些公私合营和私营五金机器工厂，由于劳动组织不合理或生产任务不足，却积压了很多技术工人。北京市地方国营消防器材厂和一个国营机床制造厂也都有百分之二十到三十的多余的技术工人。有些企业因为技工太多，影响了工人和学徒的升级、计件工资的推行和生产效率的提高。还有个别单位本不急需技工却大量招收，以致技工到厂后长期没有工作，有的只好做粗工活。但有些新建、扩建和已投入生产的企业又缺乏大量的技术工人，得不到及时的补充。
    根据以上情况，目前劳动调配工作的主要任务应当是加强劳动力管理工作，克服浪费，并妥善地处理企业中的多余人员和城市中的剩余劳动力，逐步达到劳动力的合理使用。
    各级劳动部门应该督促各企业部门，本着精简节约的精神，认真检查现有劳动力的使用情况，消除不顾生产成本、大量窝工和随意浪费劳动力的现象。各企业要根据精简原则，规定定员标准，建立编制定员制度。今后老厂矿应该是增产不增人，新厂矿增加工人时必须由企业主管部门首先在自己所管辖的老厂矿中进行抽调，不足时经过劳动部门批准从其他部门抽调，仍不足时才能经过批准招工。这样就能杜绝盲目增加人员和乱招工人的现象。
    重视和做好劳动力平衡计划工作，有计划地调配劳动力。各企业要根据生产任务和劳动计划，充分估计可能提高劳动生产效率的各种因素，按照合理使用和节约劳动力的原则编制本单位的劳动力平衡计划。今后各企业招收新的工人、或企业主管部门在所辖企业中调配工人时，应该根据已被批准的劳动计划和劳动力平衡计划来进行，并要严格遵守调配制度和法令。各级劳动部门要根据劳动力资源分布情况，分别轻重缓急供应各企业所需要的劳动力。由于建筑工程施工的季节性和临时性等特点，由于工程任务的变动性较大，为了避免劳动力需用计划同施工作业计划的脱节，各建筑企业应随同施工计划的变动及时修改、补充劳动力平衡计划和需工计划，报送当地劳动部门申请调配。劳动部门为适应建筑工人调配的特殊情况，应及时解决建筑单位间的劳动力窝缺问题，应加强季度、月度劳动力平衡计划制度，以保证满足重点施工单位劳动力的需要，并减少窝工浪费。
    各级劳动部门要协助各企业妥善处理编余人员。各企业在处理编余人员时必须为新建扩建企业抽调一部分身体健康、政治可靠，技术较好的骨干，并尽量做到为新建扩建企业组织输送整班的生产工人。各企业在抽调工人时必须从整体出发，挑得过严是不对的，但只抽弱的不给好的也是不对的，企业主管部门和劳动部门必须对这项工作进行及时的监督检查。对有培养前途的编余人员，应根据需要送入技工学校、技术学校学习。对暂时无法处理者，应组织轮班训练，以待安置处理。对于丧失劳动力不能继续工作的老、弱、病、残人员，应分别按照劳动保险条例和退职办法进行安置。
    在劳动力调配过程中，应对过剩的固定建筑工人和已登记的临时建筑工人分别情况进行妥善安置。为此，各建筑企业的主管部门应将工程任务少或无工程任务的建筑工程公司抽调到重点建设地区去。各建筑企业所需要的临时工人，劳动部门也应尽量从工程任务少或没有工程任务的城市中调配，并设法帮助工人们在当地安家立业。为了更多地解决建筑工人的失业半失业问题，建议各建筑企业可将一班制改为两班制，一方面可以多容纳一部工人，另一方面还可以避免施工紧张阶段的抢工现象。对家在农村并有土地的人，则应动员他们回乡生产。据调查，在临时工人中流入城市的农民比重很大。如杭州市在四千二百九十九名建筑工人中就有二千八百二十五名在原籍有家有田。天津市现有临时工人二万二千多人，其中除一万二千人在本市有户口外，其余大部是由农村流入的。但是，在动员他们还乡生产时，要同县区行政机关取得密切联系，分别情况进行妥善安置，以免他们再度流入城市。有些地区，可进行有条件的移民工作，动员他们去开荒生产。如杭州市已动员二千五百人开垦荒山海淤，福建准备动员二万人到老根据地去，既可减轻城市负担，又可为国家增加粮食的生产。总之，各地应根据不同情况利用一切有利条件协助临时工人寻找生活门路，对生活确实困难的应给以适当的救济。
    要有组织有计划地输送某些城市过剩劳动力，特别是技术工人和临时建筑工人，去支援重点建设的城市。对不宜继续在当地生产的企业可以把工厂设备和工人迁移到新的建设地区。据了解，有些城市的私营机器工业生产任务不足，而某些重点建设的地区却需要一些小型机器工厂和附属工厂。因此，劳动部门应积极地协同有关部门进行这一工作。从某些城市调配技术工人到重点工程重点厂矿参加生产时，劳动部门不仅要努力做好调配工作，并要适当地解决工资福利等问题。对服务性行业也应根据重点建设城市的需要，从某些城市有计划地输送和迁移。各工厂招收学徒和技工学校招收学员时，应尽量从劳动力过剩城市中的复员建设军人和未能升学的初中、高小毕业生及失学青年中录取。
    一九五五年调配工作的任务是繁重的，艰巨的。为了完成这个任务，劳动部门必须继续加强调配工作：要加强计划统计工作，严格控制和掌握企业的需工计划和劳动力的分布情况，经常对需工计划和劳动力分布情况进行分析研究；要加强企业主管部门之间和地区之间劳动力调配的具体组织工作，及时检查调配工作进行情况，解决在调配工作中所遇到的各项困难问题；要在各级党委的领导和支持下，同有关企业和工会取得密切配合，并经常注意学习业务总结工作经验；最后，还要加强对工人、职员遵守政府调动工作命令的教育，动员他们到需要的岗位上去，为建设社会主义贡献自己的力量。
