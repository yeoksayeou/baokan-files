    Anshan Iron and Steel Company Should Seriously Address the Problem of Overstocked Raw Materials
    He Guiqian, Director of the Anshan First Office of the Anshan Branch of the People's Bank of China

    During the anti-waste campaign in the first half of this year, the Supply Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company discovered sixteen types of overstocked raw materials, including steel, plumbing, nails, electrical equipment, bearings, and rubber, with a value of nearly 10 million yuan. The inventory of one type of wood screw in the nail material category was over eight tons, enough to last for more than eighty years based on the average annual consumption in the past. In the plumbing materials, there were 4,400 fire hose couplings in stock, enough for 147 years based on the average annual consumption of only 30 in the past three years. These are still materials that have not lost their value; as for the large quantities of materials filling the warehouses that have become waste products and scrap due to years of neglect, such as tees, elbows, unions, wires, cables, rubber wires, paint brushes, carrying baskets, and ball bearings, it is impossible to calculate their actual value.

    We calculated the accounts for the Supply Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. If only the value of those sixteen types of raw materials that have not lost their use value - nearly 10 million yuan - were deposited in the bank, it would earn 4.32 million yuan in interest over three years. The state would create a large amount of wealth using this 10 million yuan deposit. The overstocking of these 10 million yuan of raw materials requires paying 1.24 million yuan in interest on loans over three years.

    This situation of overstocking and wasting raw materials exists to varying degrees in all workshops, factories, and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. A single casting pipe factory overstocked raw materials worth 100,000 yuan. On one occasion, twenty tons of crane reduction gearboxes were ordered, and due to duplicate orders, three and a half tons were overstocked, enough for four or five years of use. Another example is a type of yellow plum steel crossbeam, where the "groove" was accidentally omitted by the designer, resulting in twenty unusable pieces. There are many similar cases.

    How did this situation arise? The following facts can illustrate:

    In 1952, the company needed plumbing equipment and sent people to purchase it everywhere, buying whatever they saw in large quantities. Once, a supplier specializing in the production of tees, elbows, and faucets was found in Tianjin - the prison production brigade. The purchasing agent immediately asked for ten train cars. The prison production brigade could not produce that much and returned three train cars. Including one train car of unqualified products that was returned, only one-quarter of the remaining six train cars has been used to date, and the remainder is expected to last for another twenty or thirty years. Another example is bearings. Although there was a large backlog in the warehouse, the company purchased them in large quantities from domestic and foreign sources again in 1954, and none have been used to date. Several tons of soda bottle caps were purchased in 1953, and more than three tons are still overstocked in the warehouse, worth more than 20,000 yuan, of which two-thirds are rusted and unusable. Some items could have been made by utilizing old materials through smelting or reprocessing, but no one took care of such matters, and money was constantly spent on buying ready-made items everywhere.

    What is the ideological root of this blind procurement?

    First and foremost, some personnel at Anshan Iron and Steel Company who manage raw materials and financial affairs, especially some leaders, have a serious mindset of "we're a large enterprise, a little waste doesn't matter." Once, we suggested to the company, "If you can dispose of 5 million yuan worth of overstocked materials, you can solve the needs of the entire working capital of the Anshan City Supply and Marketing Cooperative system." However, a company leader found it ridiculous and thought: they are a large integrated enterprise, and they must consider things from a broad perspective. The bank is small and doesn't understand anything. The ideas of "buying wide and using narrow, it's better to be prepared" and "overstocking and waste are unavoidable" are even more serious. In the 1955 Anshan Iron and Steel Company's draft plan for fixed working capital, a large amount of excessive, overstocked, and non-circulating materials were included, causing the fixed amount to lose its advanced nature and guiding role. As a result, the fixed amount was so large that it was still not exceeded even after suggesting several tens of millions of yuan of overstocked materials. The only role that such a fixed amount can play is to encourage overstocking and waste.

    The relevant leaders of the company are not unaware of these problems, but they do not pay attention to them and are unwilling to heed the opinions of others. The Anshan Office of the People's Bank of China often provides the company with opinions on the use of funds. For example, at the end of 1953, we raised an opinion on the company's fund activities, but the company's finance department used excuses such as discrepancies in figures, incomplete information, and inappropriate materials to avoid answering the correct parts. In August 1954, we raised an opinion on the company's fund overstocking and listed many facts, but these opinions sank without a trace. At the end of 1954, we made suggestions on the company's material overstocking, but it suffered the same fate.

    When dealing with the problem of fund overstocking, the company often shirks responsibility with words like: "There's no way! The state insists on balancing, you have to take it even if you don't want it." But the state has never asked Anshan Iron and Steel Company to store fire hose couplings that would last for 147 years, nor has it allowed Anshan Iron and Steel Company to buy tons of soda bottle caps and leave them in the warehouse to rust.

    The finance and supply departments of Anshan Iron and Steel Company are so unwelcoming of criticism that when the bank raises an opinion, they even take the measure of refusing to supply information to obstruct it. Therefore, we suggest that the relevant higher authorities conduct a thorough inspection of the use of funds at Anshan Iron and Steel Company, especially the occupation of reserve funds, and take effective measures to deal with it.

    鞍钢应该认真处理积压原材料的问题
    中国人民银行鞍山分行鞍钢第一办事处主任　何贵谦
    鞍钢供应处在今年上半年的反浪费运动中，发现积压的钢铁、水暖、钉材、电气、轴承、橡胶等十六种原材料，价值就近一千万元。钉材中的一种木螺丝，库存量有八吨多，按过去每年平均耗用量计算，够用八十多年。水暖材料中消火用的水龙带接头，库存四千四百个，按过去三年每年平均只用三十个计算，足够一百四十七年使用。这些还是没有失掉使用价值的物资；至于那些大量充塞在仓库里的，因积年累月没人理而成了废品废料的材料，如三通、弯头、活接头、电线、电缆、橡皮线、油刷子、抬筐、滚珠等，到底值多少钱，更无法计算了。
    我们给鞍钢供应处算了一下账，如果仅以那些还没有失掉使用价值的十六种原材料的价值——将近一千万元，存入银行，三年期间就可得到四百三十二万元利息。国家利用这一千万元存款将创造出大量的财富。这一千万元原材料的积压，三年贷款利息就要付出一百二十四万元。
    这种积压浪费原材料的情况，在鞍钢各车间、厂部、矿山都不同程度地存在。只是一个铸管厂，就积压了价值十万元的原材料。有一次订购了二十吨吊车的减速盒子，因为订货重复，积压了三吨半，够四、五年使用。还有一种黄梅钢十字架由于设计者疏忽，把上面的“槽”漏画了，结果做了二十个一个也不能用。类似这样的事情很多。
    这种情况是怎样造成的呢？从以下的事实可以说明：
    一九五二年公司需要水暖器材，派人到处采购，见了就买，大宗地买。有一次，在天津发现了一个专门生产三通、弯头、水咀子等的供应户——监狱生产大队，采购员张口就要十火车，监狱生产大队不能生产这么多，退了三火车，加上退掉的一火车不合格品，留下的六火车到现在只用掉四分之一，剩下的预计还够用二、三十年。再如轴承，库里已有大量积压，一九五四年公司又从国内国外大批购进，到现在一个也没有用。一九五三年买了好几吨汽水瓶盖，到现在还有三吨多积压在库里，共值两万多元，其中有三分之二已生锈不能使用。有些东西本可以利用旧材料经过熔炼或加工改制，但没有人管这样的事，一直花钱到处去买现成的。
    造成这种盲目采购的思想根源在哪里呢？
    首先是鞍钢有些管理原材料和管理财务工作的人员，特别是某些领导人员，有严重的“家大业大，浪费点没啥”的思想。有一次，我们向公司提出：“你们如果能处理积压物资五百万元，就可解决鞍山市供销合作社系统全部流动资金的需要。”但公司有位领导同志听了反而觉得很可笑，认为：他们是大联合企业，处处得从大处着眼，银行小里小气的，明白个什么。至于“宽打窄用，有备无患”、“积压浪费不可避免”的思想更是严重。一九五五年鞍钢资金定额草案中打进了大量的超额、积压和不参加运转的物资，使定额失去了先进性和指导作用，结果定额竟大到提出好几千万元的积压物资而定额仍不超过，这种定额所起的作用只能是鼓励积压浪费了。
    这些问题，公司的有关领导人员并不是不知道，只是知道而不重视，对别人的意见也不愿理睬。中国人民银行鞍钢办事处常常就有关资金使用问题向公司提出意见，如一九五三年底，我们就对公司资金活动提过一次意见，但公司财务处却借口数字有出入，情况不完全，取材不当等，对正确部分避而不答。一九五四年八月，我们对公司资金积压又提出意见并列举了很多事实，这些意见提出后也如石沉大海，消息杳无。一九五四年底，我们又对公司物资积压事提出建议，也遭到同样的命运。
    公司对待资金积压问题，常常用这样的话推脱责任：“没有办法啊！国家硬要平衡，不要也得要。”可是国家从来也没有要鞍钢存够一百四十七年使用的水龙带接头，也从来没有让鞍钢买成吨的汽水瓶盖扔在库里锈坏。
    鞍钢财务供应部门不欢迎批评竟到如此程度：当银行提了意见后，他们竟采取拒绝供应资料的办法来加以阻扰。因此，我们建议上级有关机关对鞍钢资金使用情况，特别是储备资金占用情况，进行一次彻底的检查，并采取有效措施加以处理。
