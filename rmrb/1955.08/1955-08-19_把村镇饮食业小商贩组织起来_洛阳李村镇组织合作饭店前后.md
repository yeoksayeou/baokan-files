Organizing Village and Town Catering Small Vendors
    ——Before and After the Organization of Cooperative Restaurants in Licun Town, Luoyang
    Zhang Yaohua
    Licun Town in the Eighth District of Luoyang, Henan Province, is one of the larger market towns in the county. A market is held in this town every other day, and farmers from the surrounding villages mostly come here to trade. The town has twelve restaurants and twelve cooked food stalls, and these catering small vendors regularly supply meals to passing travelers and farmers attending the market.
    After the implementation of the planned grain supply, the government adopted a method of supplying business grain quotas to the catering industry last year, generally supplying 30,000 jin of wheat per month to the catering industry in this town. According to the actual business needs of the town, this amount was more than sufficient. However, after the quota supply, an abnormal tense situation occurred in the catering industry's operation. Each restaurant only sold noodles and did not operate on side dishes. They only operated for half a day, and by the end of the month, most catering businesses closed down and no longer operated. Many passing travelers and farmers attending the market had to line up to eat and often could not buy food, which caused great dissatisfaction among the masses. Because the supply of cooked food could not meet the demand, a group of speculators in Licun Town took the opportunity to purchase steamed buns from Luoyang City to sell in Licun Town, buying thirty to fifty at a time, selling those that cost three fen for five fen, and those that cost five fen for seven fen. In the most serious cases, there were more than twenty households in the town specializing in selling cooked food, causing the cooked food market in urban and rural areas to become very chaotic. Small businessmen engaged in the catering industry, however, loudly blamed this tense situation on the government, saying that the supply of grain was too small. Many district and township staff were also misled by this illusion and echoed the demand for the government to increase the supply quota. They did not recognize that the real reason for this situation was not the government's insufficient grain supply, but the result of the catering industry's resistance and sabotage of the planned grain supply.
    The first method used by the catering industry in Licun Town to resist and undermine the government's grain purchase and supply policy was not to use all the business grain supplied by the state for business to meet the needs of the masses, but to steal and waste large quantities. Song Tongshun, a small catering businessman, and his partner Song Yongping were supplied with 3,500 jin of wheat per month by the state. In addition to eating it themselves, they took 90 jin of flour home at a time. Miao Changlu, another restaurant owner, was supplied with 1,500 jin of business grain per month by the government. He claimed that the grain supplied by the state was not enough for his business, and he often only did business for half a day, stopping business ten to five days before the end of the month. However, one day people discovered that he was drying old wheat in the field that had been eaten into empty shells by insects. This phenomenon was prevalent among catering businesses in Licun Town.
    Another form of resistance to the grain purchase and supply by the catering industry was to aggravate and create a tense market situation, selling only noodles and not operating on side dishes, thereby taking the opportunity to make exorbitant profits. After the grain purchase and supply, there was a situation where some people rushed to buy cooked food. Under such circumstances, operating noodles was much more profitable than operating other industries. One hundred jin of wheat produces eighty-eight jin of flour. Each jin of flour absorbs five liang of water, and eighty-eight jin can absorb 27.5 jin of water. The flour produced by each jin of wheat can be used to cook three bowls of noodles according to the standard amount. Each bowl sells for one jiao, which can sell for three jiao. According to the unified sales price of one jiao and two fen per jin of medium wheat, after deducting all expenses, each jin of wheat can earn a net profit of one jiao and three fen, roughly 42 percent profit. This high profit did not satisfy their demands. In the case of mass purchases, they not only reduced the quality of the noodles, but also greatly reduced the quantity. Usually, each bowl of noodles is less than four liang, and the situation of cooking four bowls and scooping five bowls is even more frequent; even so, the supply still falls short of demand. Although they only operate for half a day, their profits have not decreased. At the same time, operating on side dishes generally has lower profits and requires increasing the turnover, which requires paying more business tax. Therefore, these catering businessmen colluded with each other to refuse to operate on side dishes in order to increase the tense market situation. From this, it can be seen that the more tense the market situation, the more beneficial it is to them.
    The third method used by the catering industry to resist the grain purchase and supply policy was to use the dissatisfaction of some people with the grain supply to instigate the masses to demand that the local government increase the grain supply quota; however, some people saw through their tricks and exposed their true colors. A folk song was popular on the streets of Licun Town: "The restaurant owners are really hateful, one person sells food and the whole family is full, they only operate for half a day, the quality is not high and the quantity is small, the grain supplied by the state is eaten, drunk, and thrown away at will, they eat, hoard, and take it home, and insist that the government gives too little."
    The Licun Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative studied this situation and, with the specific help of the county cooperative, determined to organize the main part of the town's catering industry in the form of mutual assistance and cooperation, in accordance with the central government's policy of socialist transformation of rural private commerce. The businessmen in the catering industry were initially unwilling to give up the free market, which at the time had "high profits and booming business." After mobilization and persuasion, and pointing out the future, some households agreed to cooperate in management. After a short period of planning, and after drafting the articles of association and systems, the Licun Town Cooperative Restaurant, with the participation of nine households and thirteen people, was formally established and began operations in April.
    After the establishment of the cooperative restaurant, it played a significant role in saving grain and ensuring market supply. First, after being organized, it greatly facilitated the planned management of the supply and marketing cooperative and strengthened mutual supervision within the catering industry, fundamentally blocking the loopholes in stealing and hoarding grain that existed during individual operations. It ensured that the business grain supplied by the government was fully used in business. Now the restaurants in this town operate all day and all month, and although the grain supply quota has not increased, it still meets the needs of the masses. Secondly, after being organized, it is possible to further save grain, such as increasing side dishes, selling more steamed buns, and selling fewer steamed bread to reduce the amount of staple grain used, etc. Before being organized (in March), the nine catering businesses that were organized were supplied with 14,000 jin of wheat, and they only operated for half a day, opening ten to five days before the end of the month; after being organized in April, the supply of wheat was still 14,000 jin, but they operated all day, fully supplied, and at the end of the month, they had a surplus of 1,500 jin of wheat. In May, the wheat supply was reduced to 8,000 jin, but due to various reductions in the amount of staple grain used, they still operated for the whole month, fully supplied, and at the end of the month, they actually only used 7,000 jin of grain. Compared with March, the state supplied more than 7,000 jin less, but the turnover did not decrease, but increased. After being organized, the things sold were of sufficient weight and size, overcoming the profiteering behavior of the individual period, and improving the quality of food. In addition, the increase in side dishes and vegetables made it more convenient for the masses. Therefore, passing travelers and farmers attending the market were very welcome and generally reflected that "the restaurants organized by the supply and marketing cooperative sell things with real benefits." After the cooperative restaurant was organized, it also effectively cracked down on hoarding, purchasing, and selling cooked food, stabilized the cooked food market, and no longer did the phenomenon of merchants going to Luoyang City to purchase steamed bread and sell them at high prices occur.
    The process of organizing the cooperative restaurant in Licun Town shows that the catering industry in rural market towns must be strengthened in order to ensure a reasonable supply and eliminate waste. Organizing the main part of the catering small vendors through the form of cooperative restaurants is a fundamental way to block loopholes in stealing and hoarding grain and ensure a reasonable supply.

    把村镇饮食业小商贩组织起来
    ——洛阳李村镇组织合作饭店前后
    张耀华
    河南省洛阳八区李村镇，是全县较大的集镇之一。这个镇隔日一集，四乡农民大都来这里做交易。全镇有十二户饭馆，十二户熟食摊贩，这些饮食业小商贩，经常供应过往行人和赶集的农民的饭食。
    实行粮食计划供应后，去年政府对饮食业采取了定量供应营业粮食的办法，对这个镇的饮食业大体每月供应三万斤小麦，根据该镇的实际营业需要，这个数量是绰绰有余的。但限量供应之后，饮食业的经营情况却发生了不正常的紧张现象。各饭馆只卖面条，不经营副食，一天只经营半天，每到月末，大部饮食业都关门不再经营。很多过往行人和赶集的农民吃饭需要排队，还经常买不到饭吃，引起群众极大不满。由于熟食供不应求，李村镇上的一批投机商贩，就趁机活动，从洛阳市套购馒头到李村镇去卖，每次套购三、五十个，三分的卖五分，五分的卖七分。最严重时，全镇竟有二十多户专门贩卖熟食，把城乡的熟食市场弄得十分混乱。从事饮食业的小商人，却把这种紧张的原因，大喊大叫地推在政府身上，说供应的粮食太少。不少区乡工作人员也为这种假象所迷惑，随声附和要求政府增加供应指标，他们不认识造成这种情况的真实原因，并不是政府供应的粮食不足，而是饮食业抵抗和破坏粮食计划供应的结果。
    李村镇的饮食业户抵抗和破坏粮食统销政策的第一个方法，就是把国家供应给他们的营业粮，不是全部用来营业，供应群众需要，而是大量偷漏浪费。饮食业小商人宋同顺和他的伙计宋永平，每月由国家供应给他们营业粮三千五百斤小麦，他们除了自己吃之外，一次就拿回家去面粉九十斤。另一户开饭馆的苗长路，政府每月供应他一千五百斤营业粮食，他推说国家供应的粮食不够营业，经常是只做半天的生意，每月提前十至五天停止营业。有一天人们却发现他在场里翻晒被虫子蛀成空壳的陈麦子。这种现象在李村镇的饮食业户中是普遍存在的。
    饮食业者抵抗粮食统销的另一种形式，是加重并制造市场的紧张情况，只卖面条，不经营副食，从而趁机获取暴利。粮食统销之后，一部分群众争购熟食的情况是有的，在这种情况下，经营面食比较经营其他行业的利润大得多。一百斤小麦出八十八斤面粉，每斤面粉吃水五两，八十八斤可吃水二十七斤半，每斤小麦出的面粉按标准分量可煮三碗面条，每碗卖一角，就可卖三角，按统销价每斤中等小麦一角二分计算，扣除一切费用，每斤小麦可得纯益一角三分，大体有百分之四十二的利润。这种高额利润，并未能满足他们的要求，在群众争购的情况下，他们不仅降低面的质量，而且分量也大大减少。通常每碗面条连四两也不足，煮四碗捞五碗的情况更是经常；这样还是供不应求。一天虽只经营半天，利润并没有减少。同时，经营副食一般利润较低，并要加大营业额，这就要多出营业税，因此这些饮食业商人串通起来，拒绝经营副食，以增加市场的紧张情况。由此可见，市场情况越紧张就越对他们有利。
    饮食业者抵抗粮食统销政策的第三个方法，是利用部分群众对粮食供应的不满情绪，煽动群众向当地政府要求增加粮食供应指标；但也有些人看透他们的诡计，揭露了他们的真象。李村镇街上流行着一首歌谣：“开饭店的真可恼，一人卖饭全家饱，一天只营半天业，质量不高分量小，国家供应的粮食，任意吃喝任意抛，连吃带囤拿家去，硬说政府给的少”。
    李村镇供销社研究了这种情况，在县社的具体帮助下，根据中央对农村私营商业实行社会主义改造的政策，确定以互助合作的形式，首先把全镇饮食业的主要部分组织起来。饮食业的商人们对当时“利润高超、生意兴隆”的自由市场，开始是不愿放弃的，经过动员说服，指明前途，有些户才同意合作经营。又经过短时期筹划，草拟了章程、制度之后，由九户十三人参加的李村镇合作饭店，于四月正式成立并开始营业。
    合作饭店成立以后，在节约粮食、保证市场供应方面，起了显著的作用。首先，组织起来以后，大大便利了供销社的计划管理，加强了饮食业内部的互相监督，从根本上把单独经营时偷囤粮食的漏洞堵塞住了。保证了政府供应的营业粮完全用在营业上。现在这个镇上的饭店整日整月营业，粮食供应指标虽没有增加，仍满足了群众的需要。其次，组织起来后，就有可能进一步节约粮食。如增加副食，多卖包子，少卖馒头以减少主食用粮的数量等等。组织起来的九户饮食业，组织起来以前（三月份）九户供应麦子一万四千斤，一天只营业半天，月末提前十至五天开门；四月份组织起来以后，供应的麦子仍是一万四千斤，整日营业，充分供应，月末结账，还节余小麦一千五百斤。五月份供应麦子减到八千斤，由于多方减少了主食用粮的数量，仍然是全月营业，充分供应，月末结账，实际只用粮七千斤。和三月份比较，国家少供应了七千多斤，而营业额并没有下降，反而上升。组织起来以后，卖的东西足秤足码，克服了单干时期的暴利行为，提高了食品的质量。再加上副食菜类的增加，更方便了群众。因此，来往行人、赶集农民非常欢迎，普遍反映：“供销社组织的饭店，卖的东西真实惠”。合作饭店组织起来以后，还有力地打击了囤积套购，捣卖熟食的行为，稳定了熟食市场，再没有发生商贩到洛阳市套购馒头、高价出售的现象了。
    李村镇组织合作饭店的经过说明：农村集镇饮食业必须加强管理，才能保证合理供应、杜绝浪费。通过合作饭店的形式把饮食业小商贩的主要部分组织起来，是堵塞偷囤粮食漏洞、保证合理供应的一个根本办法。
