Learning from the Experience of the Comprehensive Utilization Plan for the Yellow River
Member of the Yellow River Planning Commission Li Rui

After five years of efforts by the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Ministry of Geology, and other relevant departments, and with the help of the Soviet expert team, the comprehensive planning report on the management and development of the Yellow River has been compiled.

Why is it necessary to make a plan for the entire river before solving the Yellow River problem? This is because a river, especially a large river, has very complex natural conditions, and its relationship with social economy is also very complex. If these two aspects of the situation are not clarified, the management and development of the river, and the selection of engineering goals for this purpose, may be blind and accidental. Not only will the due benefits not be obtained, but it will also affect the rational development of the entire river.

The natural water volume of a river and the natural slope of the river (the drop between the upstream and downstream sections) are valuable assets of the country. The basic task of river planning is to correctly select the first phase of the project according to the urgent needs of various national economic sectors; at the same time, according to the social and economic conditions, topography, geology, and hydrological conditions of the entire basin (or a major river section), arrange the cascade development plan of the river, so that the current interests are combined with long-term interests. Both the first phase of the project and the cascade development must maximize the use of river resources—the river's water volume and drop.

The national economic sectors closely related to rivers mainly include flood control, power generation, irrigation, navigation, and urban and industrial water supply. They have different requirements for rivers, and these requirements have certain contradictions and the situation is complicated. The basic principle of comprehensive utilization of rivers lies in how to meet the requirements of all relevant parties from the highest comprehensive benefit of the national economy with the most economical investment of the country, rather than merely satisfying the highest interests of one party.

The contradiction between the above five aspects mainly lies in whether or not water is needed and how to use water. In China, the floods of general rivers are concentrated in summer and autumn. For example, 70% of the water volume of the Yellow River is concentrated in the months of July, August, September, and October. In order to eliminate flood disasters, it is required to control the excess water volume that exceeds the river's drainage capacity during the flood season. However, power generation, irrigation, navigation, and urban and industrial water supply all need water, and they are all afraid of insufficient water; among them, irrigation and water supply consume water, while power generation and navigation only use water. These four aspects have commonalities and contradictions in water use. They all require increasing the dry season flow of the river (generally from November to March of the following year is the dry season of the river), but there are certain conflicts in the distribution of water volume, the time of water use, and the location of water intake. Irrigation water use changes with the production of crops and is uneven throughout the year; power generation water use has less seasonal variation and can be handled more flexibly; navigation only requires the channel to maintain a certain depth; urban and industrial water supply is also relatively stable throughout the year.

The natural flow of rivers is very uneven and varies greatly. For example, the maximum and minimum flow of the Yellow River differ by about 200 times. How can we solve the above five aspects' requirements for control and rational use of river water surplus and deficit? What method can be used to control the flow of river water? The main method is to build a dam across the river, forming a reservoir upstream of the dam. The role of the reservoir is to control and regulate the natural flow of the river, and to balance the water volume according to people's needs. To put it another way, the reservoir is like a bank, the natural flow is income, and people's needs are expenditure; how to make a good balance of income and expenditure to meet the requirements of all parties is the task of the reservoir. This calculation of reservoir regulation and water balance has been developed into a special science in the Soviet Union, which is indispensable in all hydropower and water conservancy engineering designs.

The relationship between flood control and the other four aspects to the reservoir is mainly the contradiction between the rise and fall of the reservoir water level. Flood control requires lowering the reservoir water level before the flood season in order to vacate the storage capacity to intercept the flood; while the other four aspects, especially power generation, require the reservoir to maintain a certain depth and supply the required water volume. Soviet experience tells us that as long as the river's water volume change is fully studied and mastered, and the rational reservoir regulation and water balance work is done according to the needs of all parties, the contradiction between flood control and the other four aspects, as well as the contradiction between the four aspects, can be completely resolved. If the flood forecast work is done well upstream of the reservoir, and water can be discharged and stored in time, the reservoir regulation can be made more rational and the river water volume can be better utilized. The current reservoir operation of the Fengman Hydropower Station is done in this way.

When building dams and a series of hydraulic structures on the river, their comprehensive utilization must also be carefully considered so that they can meet the comprehensive requirements of all aspects of the national economy. Just as the city gate is for the passage of all vehicles, horses, and people, a large city gate cannot be opened for adults and a small city gate cannot be opened for children. If the dam raises the water level, creating a drop for hydropower generation, it also creates favorable water intake conditions for irrigation and water supply, and the navigation in the reservoir area also increases convenience. On rivers with flood control requirements, when hydropower stations are built, the maximum flood must be considered, and flood discharge equipment must be installed to control the safe discharge volume downstream. Therefore, there is no need to build another set of hydraulic structures specifically for flood control. Therefore, the dam, spillway, powerhouse of the hydropower station, water intake for irrigation and water supply, and the various hydraulic structures such as ship locks should be considered as a whole based on the local natural conditions of the river, the technical requirements of each building, and economic comparisons. When designing the overall layout of a hydraulic hub, if any aspect of the national economy is not considered enough, it will cause unreasonable hydraulic construction and even irreparable losses.

The flood problem of many rivers in China is particularly serious, and floods affect the lives and property of the vast majority of people. Therefore, when considering the comprehensive utilization of reservoirs, flood control needs to be placed in the most important position. When building hydraulic structures on rivers with serious flood disasters, power generation and irrigation should naturally be subordinate to flood control requirements. This means that the comprehensive utilization of rivers is to maximize the satisfaction of all aspects, but it is not from an average point of view, but should be based on economic analysis and comparison to distinguish between primary and secondary relationships and achieve unified coordination.

History shows that the above-mentioned principles for the comprehensive utilization planning of rivers can only be thoroughly realized in countries with people's democracy and socialism; capitalist countries are restricted by the capitalist ownership of the means of production and land, and cannot realize this fundamental principle. There are countless examples of unreasonable river development and water conservancy projects in the United States and other capitalist countries.

The Chinese people have fought a great struggle against the disasters of the Yellow River for thousands of years, and have accumulated a lot of experience in controlling water disasters and irrigating and preventing drought. However, in the past, due to the limitations of social conditions and scientific and technological conditions, the Yellow River could only be managed passively, and it was impossible to propose a slogan of comprehensive development. The management of the Yellow River in the past dynasties was limited to building river embankments in the downstream area to transport floods and sediment into the sea. Of course, these projects also controlled the floods of the Yellow River to a certain extent during a certain period, but this could only temporarily alleviate the floods, and could not fundamentally solve the Yellow River problem. For thousands of years, sediment has continued to accumulate in the downstream river channel, and the riverbed has continued to rise and change, so the river embankment has to compete with the riverbed in height. If the flood is too large and too fierce, and the river embankment is breached, the Yellow River has the danger of changing to a new course. This danger still exists today.

The disaster problem of the Yellow River must not only be solved from the result—downstream floods and sediment accumulation, but more importantly, from the cause of the disaster—soil erosion in the middle reaches. It will naturally not be possible to achieve results in the soil and water conservation work in the Loess Plateau area of more than 300,000 square kilometers in a short period of time, and it must be carried out for decades. Therefore, in order to solve the urgent flood disaster problem in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, it is necessary to solve the problems of floods and sediment at the same time; it is only possible to select a suitable location and build a reservoir with a huge storage capacity to intercept floods and sediment, so as to gain a long time to do a good job in soil and water conservation work in the middle reaches.

In addition to water disasters, the entire Yellow River basin also often experiences serious droughts. At present, the irrigated area in the Yellow River basin is only 10% of the possible irrigated area of the entire basin, and very little of the vast farmland in the lower reaches benefits from the irrigation of the Yellow River. In order to fight against drought and increase agricultural output, the Yellow River basin urgently needs to develop irrigation.

The Yellow River basin has abundant mineral and hydropower resources. Gansu, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, Henan and other provinces and regions will build many industrial centers in the next few five-year plan periods, which requires a large amount of cheap electricity, because only cheap electricity can promote industrial development faster. The rich hydropower resources and superior technical and economic conditions of the Yellow River itself happen to be able to complete this task satisfactorily. However, not a single kilowatt of electricity from the Yellow River has been developed yet.

With the development of industry and agriculture in the Yellow River basin, and the growth of industrial cities, new requirements will also be put forward for the navigation, urban and industrial water supply of the Yellow River.

Therefore, in order to solve the Yellow River problem, we naturally cannot follow the old path of history, and we can no longer only start from passive management, but must combine active development, fully utilize the resources of the Yellow River, and seek the greatest comprehensive benefits from all relevant parties based on the Soviet experience and the principle of comprehensive utilization. In solving the Yellow River problem, the political and economic situation of our country today is completely possible and completely necessary to take the road of comprehensive utilization. In particular, the huge reservoirs for solving the downstream flood and sediment problems require huge investments from the country, and they should accomplish the highest comprehensive utilization tasks.

However, due to the particularly serious flood problem of Chinese rivers and the urgency of the prevention and control tasks, as well as the extreme lack of technical data in old China, at the beginning of the founding of the country, it was necessary to start solving the flood control problem of certain rivers without making a river plan. The limitations of historical traditional concepts on us, as well as the insufficient promotion of Soviet advanced experience, have also made it difficult to implement the principles of comprehensive utilization planning of rivers. Some technicians had some incorrect and confused ideas about the comprehensive utilization of rivers: such as thinking that it is impossible to comprehensively solve all the requirements of water conservancy undertakings; or also agreeing to comprehensive utilization, but dividing the upstream and downstream of the river and treating them separately; or mechanically dividing the reservoir into several layers, each not interfering with each other; or isolating and arranging organic hydraulic structures. In short, things that did not conform to the principles of comprehensive utilization had occurred in river planning, reservoir regulation and water allocation calculation, and specific engineering layout. These unreasonable ideas were also reflected in the Yellow River planning work. For example, the selection of the first phase of the Yellow River project, especially the selection of Sanmenxia, was completely resolved after criticizing some incorrect ideas about comprehensive utilization.

The Yellow River Comprehensive Plan is the first time in our country that it has put forward a plan to fundamentally control the Yellow River's water disasters and develop the Yellow River's water conservancy. The task of the plan is to solve five urgent problems, namely: preventing serious flood disasters in the lower reaches; widely increasing the irrigated area; the electricity necessary for the development of industry and agriculture; the corresponding development of navigation; soil and water conservation work in the vast Loess Plateau area. According to the natural conditions and social and economic conditions of the Yellow River, the combination of current interests and long-term development, the planning report proposes a cascade development plan of 46 levels from Longyangxia to Haikou, and selects several hydraulic hubs with very large storage capacity and high comprehensive utilization benefits, such as Longyangxia, Jishixia, Liujiaxia, Heishanxia, and Sanmenxia, which can solve flood control, power generation, irrigation, and navigation problems. Among them, the Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia hydraulic hubs have been selected as the first phase of the project. In the 46-level plan layout, the inundation of several important river lands, plains, and irrigation areas is avoided; a total of 2,537 meters of drop in the river channel from Longyangxia to Haikou is planned to be used 2,112 meters, with a utilization rate of 83%. The long-term development of irrigation almost uses all the available water volume of the Yellow River. The planning report also stipulates the different characteristics of comprehensive utilization in each river section: from Longyangxia to Qingtongxia section, mainly for power generation, combined with flood control, irrigation, and navigation; from Qingtongxia to Hekouzhen section, mainly for irrigation and navigation, power generation is of little significance; from Hekouzhen to Longmen section, mainly for power generation and soil and water conservation; from Longmen to Mangshan section is the key section for the current Yellow River management and development, mainly for flood control (intercepting sediment), irrigation, power generation, and navigation. The area below Mangshan is mainly for navigation and irrigation.

The above-mentioned problems in each section of the entire river are actually several aspects of the entire Yellow River problem, and there are comprehensive relationships of mutual restriction and mutual development between them; when solving any problem, the comprehensiveness of the problem cannot be ignored, and it is necessary to seek the simultaneous solution of other problems as much as possible. For example, when solving the irrigation problem, the selection of the irrigation area must use the favorable conditions of water volume regulation created by the first-phase hydraulic hub; when calculating the irrigation water volume, it must be coordinated with the requirements of power generation and navigation; when designing irrigation engineering structures, it must also consider the navigation problem in the irrigation canal, the power generation problem at the concentrated drop, and the problems of sediment accumulation and possible floods; developing irrigation in soil and water conservation areas must be combined with soil and water conservation tributary reservoirs.

The section between Longmen and Mangshan is the most critical river section for solving the Yellow River problem. Building the first phase of the project in this river section should comprehensively solve the current and long-term tasks of flood control, sediment interception, irrigation, power generation, and navigation. Flood control and sediment interception are two sides of the same problem, and both should be controlled at the same time. Sediment cannot be allowed to continue to wash down, otherwise the downstream riverbed will still accumulate, and the dikes will still be tight; at the same time, stabilizing the river channel and irrigation both require the reservoir to release clear water. Therefore, in order to solve the above major problems, it is necessary to choose a location that is economically and technically suitable for building a high dam to create a reservoir with a huge volume.

After careful comparison, Sanmenxia is the only location that can solve the above comprehensive tasks. The comprehensive plan also stipulates the construction of the Sanmenxia hydraulic hub as one of the main projects of the first phase of the plan. The current task is to concentrate efforts to do a good job in this project. According to the plan, when the Sanmenxia project raises the water level to an elevation of 350 meters above sea level (the river surface is 280 meters above sea level), the reservoir volume will be 36 billion cubic meters.

After the completion of the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station, which is a dam-type, a high degree of comprehensive benefits will be obtained in flood control, irrigation, power generation, and navigation. In terms of flood control, the maximum flood flow of the Yellow River can be reduced from 37,000 cubic meters per second to 8,000 cubic meters per second (and further reduced to 6,000 cubic meters per second in the future). This flow is the safe discharge flow of the downstream river channel. After controlling the floods of the three tributaries of Yi, Luo, and Qin in the lower reaches, the threat of floods in the lower reaches of the Yellow River can be fundamentally eliminated. Sediment can be intercepted and clear water can be discharged, so that the downstream riverbed will no longer rise, the river channel will tend to be stable, and the dikes on both sides will be easy to defend. The dry season flow can be regulated, creating favorable conditions for the development of irrigation, power generation, and navigation. Because sediment is controlled and the flow is regulated, the vast area downstream of Sanmenxia can smoothly develop an irrigated area of more than 22 million mu before 1967. Due to the regulation of the flow and the concentration of the drop by the dam, the power generation capacity of the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station reaches 1 million kilowatts, and the average annual power generation is about 4.6 billion kilowatt-hours (equal to 64% of China's power generation in 1952). This huge power can be supplied to the major heavy industrial areas that are developing in Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi and other provinces. With the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station as the center, connecting the thermal power plants in the nearby areas, it will become a large power system in central China; in the future, it can be connected with the water and thermal power plants planned to be built in the Yangtze River basin, becoming the largest power system in China. Navigation downstream of Sanmenxia will also be improved, and navigation can be developed in the reservoir area.

The Sanmenxia Reservoir has huge inundation losses, which is one of the most difficult problems encountered in the Yellow River planning work, but it is also a problem that cannot be avoided. When considering this issue, on the one hand, it is necessary to see the great political and economic positive significance of solving the Yellow River problem; on the other hand, it is also necessary to see that after the propaganda and education of the general line, the level of consciousness of the people is constantly improving, and it can be achieved in our country that the partial interests are subordinate to the overall interests. Therefore, it is believed that under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and after arduous and meticulous work, and after proper arrangements have been made for the production conditions and living conditions of the relocated residents, this problem can be completely solved. We cannot hinder the realization of the entire Yellow River comprehensive utilization plan because of this problem.

In order to reduce the amount of sediment in the Yellow River, reduce the siltation of the Sanmenxia Reservoir, and at the same time to develop agricultural production in the vast Loess Plateau area and improve the lives of the people in the area, while building the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station, it is necessary to vigorously mobilize the masses to carry out soil and water conservation work and build tributary reservoirs mainly for intercepting sediment. According to the fifteen-year plan for soil and water conservation work, by 1967, the sediment flowing into the Sanmenxia Reservoir is estimated to be reduced by half. Therefore, soil and water conservation work is closely related to the mission undertaken by the Sanmenxia project.

In short, the construction of the Sanmenxia Hydraulic Hub can ensure that my country's socialist economic construction is not threatened by the Yellow River floods; at the same time, it lays a deep foundation for the development of industry and agriculture in a vast area; especially around this huge power center, a complete set of large industries can be built, dozens of modern farms can be built, and it can play a huge role in my country's socialist industrialization.

The Yellow River problem is a problem that China has not solved for thousands of years, and it is extremely important to my country's current and long-term socialist construction. For more than 30 years, the Soviet Union has created a complete set of theories in the comprehensive utilization of rivers, and has carried out and is carrying out great construction. Today, with the help of the Soviet government, our country has completed the Yellow River planning work. Soviet experts have imparted this advanced science to us in concrete terms with rich experience, high technology, and dialectical thinking methods. They have not only helped us solve many major technical problems, but more importantly, helped us improve our level of thinking in solving complex problems like the Yellow River.

In the process of carrying out the Yellow River comprehensive utilization plan, all relevant departments carried out comprehensive cooperation, which made the work possible to be completed smoothly. However, in the process of work, we also encountered many problems and had some different opinions. These problems and opinions were finally resolved, so we gained a lot of experience. The most important experience is how to gradually achieve ideological consensus on the basic principles of comprehensive utilization planning.

The Yellow River Comprehensive Utilization Plan provides a good example for the management and development of all important rivers in our country. There is no doubt that important rivers such as the Yangtze River, which are related to the entire national economy, should also take this path.

    学习黄河综合利用规划的经验
    黄河规划委员会委员　李锐
    经过水利部、燃料工业部、地质部和其它有关部门五年的努力和苏联专家组的帮助，关于治理和开发黄河的综合规划报告已经编制出来了。
    解决黄河的问题，为什么必须先作好全河流的规划呢？这是因为一条河流特别是大的河流，自然情况非常复杂，它同社会经济的关系也非常复杂。这两方面的情况如不弄清楚，要治理和开发河流，以及为此目的在河流上选择工程目标时，就可能带有盲目性和偶然性，不仅不能获得应有的效益，还会影响整个河流的合理开发。
    河流的天然水量和河流的自然坡降（各河段上下游间的落差）都是国家宝贵的财富。河流规划的基本任务就是要根据各国民经济部门提出的迫切要求，正确选定第一期工程；同时根据全流域（或某一主要河段）的社会经济情况和地形、地质、水文条件，布置河流的梯级开发方案，使目前利益和长远利益相结合。第一期工程和梯级开发，都必须最大限度地利用河流的资源——河流的水量和落差。
    同河流关系密切的国民经济部门主要有防洪、发电、灌溉、航运、城市和工业给水等五个方面，他们对于河流各有不同的要求，这些要求相互之间有一定的矛盾，情况是错综复杂的。河流综合利用的基本原则就在如何以国家最经济的投资，从国民经济的最高综合效益出发，来满足各有关方面的要求，而不是仅仅满足某一方面的最高利益。
    以上五个方面间的矛盾主要在于要不要水和如何使用水这两方面。中国一般河流的洪水集中在夏季和秋季，如黄河水量的百分之七十集中在七、八、九、十几个月。为了消除洪水灾害，要求控制洪水时期超过河道排泄能力的多余水量。但是发电、灌溉、航运、城市和工业给水都需要水，都唯恐水量不够；其中灌溉、给水是消耗水的，发电、航运只使用水。这四个方面在用水上有共同处也有矛盾处，它们都要求提高河流的枯水流量（一般每年十一月至第二年三月是河流枯水季节），但对水量的分配、用水的时间和取水的地点都有一定的抵触。灌溉用水随农作物生产情况而变化，一年四季不平稳；发电用水季节性变化较小，且可比较灵活处理；航运只要求航道维持一定的深度；城市和工业给水一年四季用水也是比较平稳的。
    河流的天然流量很不均匀而且变化很大，如黄河最大和最小流量相差约二百倍。怎样才能解决上述五个方面对河流水量盈亏控制和合理使用的要求呢？用什么办法来控制河水的流量呢？主要的办法就是修筑拦河坝，在坝的上游形成一个水库。水库的作用就是对河流的天然流量进行控制和调节，根据人们的需要来平衡水量。打个比方，水库好像是银行，天然流量是收入，人们的需要是支出；如何作好收支平衡，满足各方要求，就是水库的任务。这种水库调节和水量平衡的计算，在苏联已发展成为一种专门的科学，所有水电和水利工程设计中都必不可少。
    防洪和其他四个方面对于水库的关系，主要是水库水位消涨的矛盾。防洪要求在汛前降低水库水位，以便空出库容来拦蓄洪水；而其他四个方面特别是发电则要求水库保持一定的深度，并供给所需的水量。苏联的经验告诉我们，只要充分研究掌握了河流的水量变化情况，并根据各个方面的需要作好了合理的水库调节和水量平衡的工作，防洪同其他四个方面的矛盾以及四个方面之间的矛盾都是完全可以解决的。如果在水库上游作好了洪水预报的工作，能及时放水和蓄水，水库调节还可以作得更合理，更好地利用河流水量。现在丰满水电站的水库操作就是这样办的。
    在河流上修建拦河坝以及一系列的水工建筑物的时候，也必须认真地考虑它们的综合利用问题，即使之能够满足国民经济各方面的综合要求。正如城门为一切车马人等通行，不能为大人开大城门，为小人开小城门。如拦河坝抬高了水位，给水力发电造成了落差，同时也为灌溉和给水造成了有利的取水条件，水库区内的航运也增加了便利。在有防洪要求的河流上修建水电站，必然要考虑到最大的洪水，必然要装建泄洪的设备来控制下游的安全泄量，因而就完全没有必要另外再修建一套专为防洪的水工建筑物。因此拦河坝、溢洪道、水电站的厂房、灌溉和给水的取水口，以及船闸等各个水工建筑物，都应当根据当地河流的自然条件、各个建筑物的技术要求和经济比较作全盘统一的考虑。在设计水力枢纽的总体布置时，如果对国民经济任何一个方面考虑不够，就会造成水工建筑的不合理，甚至引起不可补救的损失。
    中国许多河流的洪水问题特别严重，水灾影响到广大人民的生命财产，因此考虑水库的综合利用时，往往防洪需要摆在最首要的地位。在有严重水害的河流上修建水工建筑物时，发电和灌溉等自应服从防洪的要求。这就是说，河流的综合利用固然是要最大限度地满足各方面的要求，但并不是从平均观点出发，而应根据经济分析比较，分清主次关系，取得统一协调。
    历史说明，上述对于河流综合利用规划的原则，只有在人民民主和社会主义制度的国家才能彻底实现；资本主义国家受到生产资料和土地的资本主义所有制的限制，不可能实现这个根本的原则。河流开发和水利工程不合理的例子，在美国和其他各资本主义国家是举不胜举的。
    中国人民同黄河的灾害作了几千年的伟大的斗争，积累了许多治理水害和灌溉、防旱的经验。但是过去由于社会条件和科学技术条件的限制，对于黄河只能从消极的治理出发，而不可能提出全面开发的口号。历代治理黄河，只局限于在下游地区修筑河堤输送洪水和泥沙入海，当然这些工程也在一定时期和一定程度上控制了黄河的洪水，但这毕竟只能暂时减轻水患，而不能根本解决黄河的问题。千百年来，泥沙仍旧在下游河道内淤积，河床仍不断在抬高在变化，河堤就不得不同河床竞高。如果洪水过大过猛，河堤被冲破，黄河就有另改新道的危险。这种危险今天仍然存在。
    对于黄河的灾害问题，不仅要从其结果——下游的洪水和泥沙淤积来解决，更重要的是必须从灾害的原因——中游的水土流失来解决。水土保持工作要在三十多万平方公里的黄土区域获得成效，自然不是短期内所能办到的，须作几十年的持续努力。因此为解决黄河下游迫切的水灾问题，就必须同时解决洪水和泥沙的问题；就只有选择适当地点，修建有巨大库容的水库，使之拦蓄洪水和泥沙，以争取长的时间来作好中游的水土保持工作。
    除开水灾之外，整个黄河流域还有常易发生的严重的旱灾。现在黄河流域的灌溉面积仅为全流域可能灌溉面积的百分之十，下游广大耕地极少得到黄河灌溉之利。为了同旱灾作斗争，增加农业产量，黄河流域迫切需要发展灌溉。
    黄河流域有丰富的矿产和水力资源。甘肃、山西、陕西、内蒙古、河南等省区在今后几个五年计划时期内，将要建成许多工业中心城市，为此就需要大量廉价的电力，因为只有廉价的电力才能更快推动工业的发展。黄河本身蕴藏的丰富的水力资源和优越的技术经济条件，正好来圆满地完成这个任务。可是目前黄河一瓩的电力也没有被开发。
    随着黄河流域工农业的发展，工业城市的成长，对于黄河的航运、都市和工业给水，也将提出新的要求。
    因此，为解决黄河的问题，我们自然不能再走历史的老路，再不能只从消极的治理出发，而必须结合积极的开发，充分利用黄河的资源，根据苏联的经验，以综合利用的原则求得各有关方面最大的综合效益。在解决黄河的问题上，我们国家今天的政治经济情况，完全可能也完全必须走综合利用的道路。特别是为解决下游洪水和泥沙问题的巨大水库，需要国家巨额的投资，更应该完成最高的综合利用的任务。
    然而由于中国河流洪水问题的特殊严重和防治任务的急迫，以及旧中国技术资料的极端贫乏，在开国之初，不得不在没有作好河流规划之前，就动手解决某些河流的防洪问题。历史传统观念给我们的某些限制，以及苏联先进经验推广的不够，也使得河流综合利用规划的原则曾不容易得到贯彻。有些技术人员对河流的综合利用有过一些不正确的和混乱的观念：如认为综合解决所有水利事业的要求是不可能的；或者也赞成综合利用，但将河流上游下游割裂，分而治之；或者将水库机械划分为几层，各不相犯；或者将有机的水工建筑物孤立安排。总之，对河流的规划、水库调节和水量分配的计算以及具体的工程布置，都发生过不合乎综合利用原则的事。这些不合理的思想也曾反映到黄河规划工作中。如黄河各项第一期工程的选择问题，特别是三门峡的选定，就是批判了对综合利用的某些不正确思想之后，才得到完满解决的。
    黄河综合规划，在我国第一次提出了根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的计划。规划的任务是要解决五个迫切的问题，即：防止下游严重的洪水灾害；灌溉面积的广泛增加；发展工业和农业所必需的电力；航运的相应发展；广大黄土区域内的水土保持工作。根据黄河的自然条件和社会经济情况，各项目前利益和远景开发的结合，规划报告中拟定了自龙羊峡至海口间四十六个梯级的开发方案，选择了若干处库容很大具有高度综合利用效益的水力枢纽，如龙羊峡、积石峡、刘家峡、黑山峡和三门峡，都能解决防洪、发电、灌溉、航运等项问题。其中三门峡和刘家峡水力枢纽已被选定为第一期工程。四十六个梯级方案布置中避免了若干重要川地、平原和灌区的淹没；自龙羊峡至海口河道共计二五三七公尺落差，计划利用二一一二公尺，利用率达百分之八十三。灌溉远景的发展几乎使用了黄河全部可利用的水量。规划报告中还规定了各河段综合利用的不同特点：自龙羊峡至青铜峡一段，主要为发电，同时结合防洪、灌溉和航运；自青铜峡至河口镇一段，主要为灌溉和航运，发电意义不大；自河口镇至龙门一段，主要为发电和水土保持；自龙门至邙山间为当前黄河治理和开发的关键地段，主要为防洪（拦泥沙）、灌溉、发电和航运。邙山以下主要为航运和灌溉。
    以上全河分段的各项问题实际上是整个黄河问题的若干方面，其相互间都有互相约束和互相发展的综合关系；在解决任何一项问题时都不能忽视问题的综合性，必须尽可能求得其他问题的同时解决。例如解决灌溉问题时，灌溉区的选择必须利用第一期水力枢纽所造成的水量调节的有利条件；计算灌溉水量时，必须和发电、航运的要求取得协调；设计灌溉工程建筑物时，必须同时考虑灌溉渠中的通航问题，落差集中处的发电问题，以及泥沙淤积和可能遭遇的洪水问题；在水土保持地区发展灌溉，则必须同水土保持的支流水库相结合。
    龙门至邙山间为解决黄河问题最关键的河段。在此河段修建第一期工程自应综合解决当前和长远的防洪、拦沙、灌溉、发电、航运等任务。防洪和拦沙为一个问题的两面，两者应同时加以控制。泥沙不能再听任继续下冲，否则下游河床照旧淤积，堤防紧张如故；同时稳定河道和灌溉均要求水库放下清水。因此，为解决上述各大问题，必须选择在经济上和技术上都适宜建筑高坝的地点，以造成有巨大容积的水库。
    经过周密比较，三门峡为唯一能够解决上述综合任务的地址。综合规划也规定了修建三门峡水利枢纽作为第一期计划的主要工程之一。当前的任务、就是集中力量作好这项工程。三门峡工程，按计划提高水位达拔海三五○公尺高程时（河面为拔海二八○公尺），水库容积为三六○亿立方公尺。
    拦河坝式的三门峡水电站建成之后，在防洪、灌溉、发电、通航各方面，将得到高度综合的效益。在防洪方面，可以把设想中的黄河最大洪水流量由三万七千秒公方减低至八千秒公方（将来更可减低至六千秒公方），此项流量为下游河道的安全泄流量。对下游伊、洛、沁三支流洪水再加以控制后，就可根本解除黄河下游洪水的威胁。可以拦蓄泥沙，下泄清水，使下游河床不再淤高，河道趋于稳定，两岸大堤便于防守。可以调节枯水流量，给灌溉、发电、航运的发展创造了有利的条件。由于泥沙得到控制，流量得到调节，三门峡下游广大地区在一九六七年以前，可以顺畅地发展灌溉面积二千二百余万亩。由于流量的调节和拦河坝将落差集中，三门峡水电站发电的能力达到一百万瓩，多年平均发电量约为四十六亿度（等于我国一九五二年发电量的百分之六十四）。这个巨大的电力可以供给河南、陕西、山西等省正在发展的主要重工业地区。以三门峡水电站为中心连结附近地区的火电厂，将成为中国中部的大电力系统；将来更可以同长江流域计划兴建的水、火电站连结起来，成为中国最大的一个电力系统。三门峡下游航运也将得以改善，在水库区域内可以发展航运。
    三门峡水库有巨大的淹没损失，这是在黄河规划工作进行中所遇到的一个最困难的问题，但这也是一个无法回避的问题。在考虑这个问题时，一方面要看到解决黄河问题的伟大的政治上和经济上的积极意义；同时也要看到经过总路线的宣传教育之后，人民群众的觉悟程度不断提高，在我们国家内能够做到局部利益服从整体利益。因而相信在共产党和人民政府的正确领导下，经过艰巨而细致的工作，对于被迁移居民的生产条件和生活条件作了妥善的安排，这个问题是完全可以得到解决的。我们不能因为这一问题，阻碍了整个黄河综合利用规划的实现。
    为了减少黄河的泥沙量，减少三门峡水库的淤积，同时为了发展广大黄土区域的农业生产和改善该区人民生活，在修建三门峡水电站的同时，必须大力动员广大群众开展水土保持工作和兴建以拦泥沙为主的支流水库。根据水土保持工作的十五年计划，到一九六七年，流入三门峡水库的泥沙，估计将减少一半。因此，水土保持工作同三门峡工程所担负的使命是密切关联着的。
    总之，三门峡水利枢纽的建设，可以保障我国社会主义经济建设不受到黄河水灾的威胁；同时在广大地区内为工业、农业的发展打下了深厚的基础；特别是围绕这一个巨大的电力中心，可以建设起整套的大工业，建设起几十个现代化的农场，为我国社会主义工业化起巨大的作用。
    黄河问题是中国几千年来所没有解决的问题，对我国当前的和长远的社会主义建设，关系极为重大。三十多年来苏联在河流综合利用方面创造了整套的学说，进行了和正在进行伟大的建设，今天我国在苏联政府的帮助下完成了黄河规划的工作。苏联专家以丰富的经验、高度的技术和辩证的思想方法具体地向我们传授了这一先进的科学，他们不仅帮助我们解决了许多重大的技术问题，更重要的是帮助我们提高了解决像黄河这样复杂问题上的思想水平。
    在进行黄河综合利用规划的过程中，各个有关部门进行了全面的合作，使这一工作得以顺利完成。但在工作过程中，也遇到过许多问题，有过一些不同的意见，这些问题和意见最后都获得了解决，从而取得许多经验。其中最重要的一条经验，就是对综合利用规划的基本原则如何逐步求得思想认识的一致。
    黄河综合利用规划为我国所有重要河流的治理和开发提供了良好的范例，像长江这样关系整个国民经济的重要河流，毫无疑问也应该走这条道路。
