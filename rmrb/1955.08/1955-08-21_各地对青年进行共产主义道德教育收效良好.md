　　Xinhua News Agency report: The centralized propaganda activities carried out extensively in 133 large and medium-sized cities across the country to cultivate communist morality among young people and resist the erosion of bourgeois ideology have mostly come to an end, and various regions are now transitioning to regular propaganda and education.

　　This propaganda activity began in October 1954. After this concentrated publicity, most of the organized youth in major and medium-sized cities received a relatively profound communist moral education. Many ideologically backward young people, after education, recognized the harm of bourgeois ideological erosion and began to change. Many young people have automatically stopped reading those reactionary, obscene, and absurd books and periodicals, severed ties with hooligan groups, and actively participated in healthy cultural and recreational activities. More and more young people in various cities are reading progressive books and periodicals, and "Devote Everything to the Party" and "The Seagull" have become books loved by young people. Most young people who have not joined the Communist Youth League have actively requested to participate in League courses after the propaganda, and have applied to join the Communist Youth League organization. Young people in major and medium-sized cities have also made great improvements in loving labor, cherishing public property, uniting and loving each other, observing social public order, and complying with labor and study discipline.

　　This concentrated propaganda activity has aroused further concern in all aspects of society for the growth of young people and children. After the propaganda, many parents realized the importance of cultivating and educating their children with communist ideology. Parents believe that children are "at the time of rooting and sprouting, and if they do not grow well, it will greatly affect the cause of socialist construction in the future." Some parents reviewed the mistakes of doting on and spoiling their children in the past without paying attention to education. School teachers have also criticized the irresponsible old teaching attitudes such as "teaching books but not teaching people" and "managing inside the school but not outside the school," and have begun to visit parents, strengthen their connections with students, and provide guidance to their lives, especially paying attention to helping backward students. Some teachers have already begun or are studying how to implement communist moral education into regular curriculum teaching. In addition, many teachers also pay special attention to strengthening their own moral cultivation and using their correct words and deeds to influence young students.

　　Cadres at all levels of the Communist Youth League have also criticized past biases such as "only caring about production, not caring about life" and "only caring about the advanced, not caring about the backward" through this concentrated propaganda activity, and have realized the important significance of carrying out political and ideological education for young people. Now, many grass-roots League organizations, under the leadership and support of the Party organizations in various departments and administrative departments, trade unions, and other aspects, have strengthened regular propaganda and education work, organized proper cultural and recreational activities, and have begun to attach importance to organizing young people to spend festivals and holidays well, and pay attention to young people's love and marriage issues.

　　各地对青年进行共产主义道德教育收效良好
    据新华社讯　在全国一百三十三个大、中城市广泛开展的培养青年共产主义道德、抵制资产阶级思想侵蚀的集中的宣传活动，大部分已告一段落，各地正转入经常化的宣传教育。
    这一宣传活动是从一九五四年十月开始的。经过这次集中宣传，各大、中城市的有组织的青年大部分受到了一次比较深刻的共产主义道德教育。许多思想比较落后的青年经过教育以后，认识到资产阶级思想侵蚀的危害性，开始有了转变。不少青年都自动停止阅读那些反动、淫秽、荒诞的书刊，并同流氓集团等割断联系，积极参加健康的文化娱乐活动。各城市阅读进步书刊的青年越来越多，“把一切献给党”、“海鸥”等成为青年热爱的书籍。大多数没有加入青年团的青年经过宣传以后，积极要求参加团课学习，并纷纷申请加入青年团组织。各大、中城市的青年在爱劳动、爱护公物、团结友爱、遵守社会公共秩序、遵守劳动纪律和学习纪律等方面，也有了很大改进。
    这次集中的宣传活动引起了社会上各方面对青年少年成长的进一步关怀。许多家长经过宣传后，认识到以共产主义思想培养教育子女的重要性。家长们认为孩子是“生根长芽的时候，长不好，将来对社会主义建设事业影响很大”。有的家长检讨了过去对子女溺爱娇养而不注意教育的错误。学校教师们也批判了“教书不教人”、“管校内不管校外”等不负责任的旧的教学态度，开始访问家长，加强同学生们的联系和对他们的生活进行指导，特别是注意帮助落后的学生。有些教师已经开始或正在研究把共产主义道德教育贯彻到正课教学中去。另外，许多教师还特别注意加强自己的道德修养，用自己的正确言行去影响青年学生。
    青年团的各级干部通过这次集中的宣传活动，也都批判了过去那种“只管生产，不管生活”、“只管先进，不管落后”等偏向，认识了向青年进行政治思想教育的重要意义。现在许多团的基层组织在各部门党的组织和行政、工会等各方面的领导和支持下，加强了经常的宣传教育工作，组织正当的文化娱乐活动，并开始重视组织青年过好节日和假期，注意青年的恋爱和婚姻问题。
