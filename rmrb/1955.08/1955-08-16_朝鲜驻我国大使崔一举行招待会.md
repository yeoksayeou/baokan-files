Xinhua News Agency, August 15th: Korean Democratic People's Republic Ambassador to China, Choi Il, held a grand reception tonight to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the liberation of Korea. Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, said at tonight's reception that the countries concerned cannot ignore the threatening actions of the South Korean authorities attempting to directly undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement, and the United States, which once signed the Armistice Agreement on behalf of the United Nations forces, bears an unshirkable responsibility. Any actions that attempt to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement and threaten the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission are unacceptable and must be resolutely stopped. Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out that we have consistently advocated that all foreign troops should withdraw from Korea, and the countries concerned should guarantee the peaceful development of Korea; we also advocate that the countries concerned should hold a Far East conference with broad participation from Asian countries to seek a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue.
