    Introducing the Second Edition of "Historical Materialism"

    Edited by Konstantinov, USSR. Translated by Liu Pikun et al. Published by People's Publishing House.
    Historical materialism is the science that studies the general laws of social development. It is the only correct theory and method for understanding social phenomena, a tool for guiding revolutionary action, and a weapon for criticizing bourgeois idealism. The recently published Chinese translation of the second edition of "Historical Materialism," edited by Konstantinov and published by the People's Publishing House, will be of great help to us in studying this science.
    The second edition of "Historical Materialism" is divided into twelve chapters. One chapter is newly added, five chapters combine two or three chapters from the first edition into one, and the rest have also been carefully revised. The length is much shorter than the first edition, but the content is more substantial.
    The laws of the development of productive forces and relations of production are the key to understanding social history. The chapter "The Development of Productive Forces and Relations of Production" clarifies these laws. Based on the Marxist-Leninist classics, especially the instructions in Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," the author emphasizes the law that the relations of production must be in accordance with the nature of the productive forces. In the sections describing the development of productive forces and relations of production in each stage of social formation, the author points out how this law is implemented and its effects. The author also explains the contradictory characteristics of productive forces and relations of production under the socialist system and the ways to resolve these contradictions, explaining that the development of society under socialism is a process of consciously utilizing objective laws, but still subject to objective laws. These are significant improvements compared to the first edition.
    The newly added chapter "The Base and Superstructure of Society" is very important. It explains the determining role of the base on the superstructure, the active role of the superstructure on the base, and the regular development and replacement of the base and superstructure. These most basic principles of historical materialism have great methodological significance. The author points out that the theory of base and superstructure "provides a guiding thread for the study of the sum total of social relations" (p. 130), "enabling us to understand and study the laws of development of social revolution, the state, law, and social ideology" (p. 155).
    In this chapter, the author also points out, based on the Soviet experience, the great role of the socialist state and the socialist ideological system in creating, developing, and consolidating their socialist base. At the same time, the author also points out that "in building a socialist society, the working class also relies on the objective law that the base plays a determining role on the superstructure." (p. 140) This means that Soviet power and socialism can never be permanently established on two opposing economic bases: one is socialist large industry that eliminates capitalist elements, and the other is individual small agriculture that generates capitalist elements. From this, it can be inferred that in the transitional period, it is necessary not only to implement socialist industrialization of the country, but also to carry out socialist transformation of agriculture, in order to successfully build a unified and solid economic base for socialism.
    These Soviet experiences have enriched the theory of base and superstructure and provided an important theoretical basis for the socialist construction policies of various people's democratic countries.
    Social life phenomena are complex and cannot be completely reduced to the categories of base or superstructure. For example, the family, which performs the necessary function of population reproduction, one of the material conditions of social life, has a form determined by economic relations, but it also expresses legal, ideological, and moral relations. Therefore, the family is a phenomenon that belongs to both the base and the superstructure. Language, on the other hand, is a tool that enables people to understand each other and coordinate their joint work in all areas of activity. It is a product of the entire history of society and the people, and serves all classes in society. Therefore, it is a phenomenon that belongs neither to the base nor to the superstructure. The author has dedicated sections to discussing these two social phenomena.
    Also, the relationship between culture and the base and superstructure should be explored in depth. The author distinguishes between material culture and spiritual culture. The former belongs to the material conditions of life and the productive forces of society; the latter, insofar as it is a social ideology, belongs to the superstructure. However, whether material or spiritual culture, many elements have served different bases and classes in many eras, and each social system and class utilizes these cultural elements in its own way, according to its own requirements and purposes.
    The author also points out that revolutions occur in the development of culture, but cultural revolutions not only do not exclude historical connections and inheritance in cultural development, but on the contrary, take historical connections and inheritance as a prerequisite. It is precisely in order to create a socialist culture that the working class accepts and transforms the cultural heritage of the past. These are all enlightening discussions for us.
    Of particular practical significance to us are the chapters "Class and Class Struggle" and "The Role of the People and Individuals in History."
    In the chapter "Class and Class Struggle," the author explains the causes of class formation, that class struggle is the driving force of the history of antagonistic societies, that the proletariat is a revolutionary class charged with the mission of overthrowing capitalism and leading society towards communism, that the class struggle of the proletariat inevitably leads to the proletariat seizing power, and that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the continuation of class struggle in a new form.
    According to Lenin's instructions, the author tells us that in the period of transition to socialism, class struggle does not disappear, but changes its form of struggle and becomes a more acute and cruel struggle in many respects. The fundamental change in the situation of class struggle after the proletariat seizes power is that the proletariat carries out class struggle in the capacity of the ruling class, using all the tools of state power to oppose the enemy. In this new situation, the new forms of proletarian class struggle are: suppressing the resistance of the exploiting classes; eliminating counter-revolutionary rebellions and wars to resist imperialist aggression; the state's leadership over the petty bourgeoisie, especially the peasantry, attracting them to the side of the proletariat; making bourgeois experts serve the proletariat, utilizing their experience and knowledge and transforming them; and educating all laborers with new discipline, overcoming the behaviors that conflict with the interests of the working class caused by the backward groups and strata being contaminated by capitalist habits and traditions. As the author says, the experiences of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries have confirmed Lenin's principle; the lessons of class struggle teach us to maintain revolutionary vigilance and irreconcilability towards the enemies of the people.
    In the chapter "The Role of the People and Individuals in History," the author says, "The people create history, first of all because they produce material materials, they create all the great material and spiritual cultural wealth with their labor, change the tools of production and develop the productive forces of society." (p. 356)
    Not only that. In class society, it is mainly the exploiting classes and their representatives who play a significant role in political life, but the great role of the people is still manifested in history. "In all kinds of class struggles, national liberation wars, and social revolutions, the masses of the people play an active and decisive role." (p. 359) "Although in past revolutions the masses of the people usually did not get the fruits of victory, the masses of the people are indeed the main, decisive, and assault force in every revolution." (p. 360)
    In the era of socialist revolution, the historical role of the masses of the people has increased greatly. The second edition of this textbook elaborates more fully on this point. The author says that the role of the proletariat and the working masses under its leadership in social development is much greater than that of slaves and serfs. In the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, "the masses of the people who have been freed from political, economic, and spiritual enslavement have shown creative power, initiative, and heroism that has never been seen in past history, making it possible for the new society to overcome all difficulties and emerging contradictions." (p. 362)
    However, subjective idealism attributes the main driving force of history to outstanding figures, while objective idealism believes that individuals and the people are playthings of supernatural forces. Historical materialism rejects all kinds of idealistic fallacies and explains that historical needs create outstanding figures, and outstanding figures use the conditions provided by history to meet those needs, explaining the influence of people's conscious activity on historical necessity and the role of chance.
    While opposing the cult of personality, historical materialism fully appreciates the role of the leading figures of each class, especially the leading figures of the proletariat. In the second edition of this textbook, the author points out that the cult of personality is contradictory to the principle of collective leadership of the Marxist-Leninist party, because "it reduces the role of the people and the role of the working class and its party, and disintegrates and paralyzes the strength of the people" (p. 383); it also points out that the excellent characteristics of proletarian leaders are that they have close ties with the masses and are deeply convinced of the creative power of the masses of the people.
    This textbook attaches importance to the experience of the Soviet Union's historical practice and pays attention to expounding issues related to the laws of development of socialist society. In addition to dedicating sections to these issues in several chapters, the chapters "The Driving Force of Socialist Society Development" and "The Laws of Transition from Socialism to Communism" specifically discuss them. In the latter chapter, the descriptions of the characteristics of the two stages of communism, the economic and cultural prerequisites for the transition to communism, and the paths to the transition to communism are all rewritten based on the principles put forward in Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR."
    A summary of the criticism of bourgeois idealism is made in the first chapter, and the rest of the chapters, especially the chapters "Material Conditions of Social Life" and "Marxist-Leninist Theory on Nationalities and National Liberation Movements," have more or less contact with it.
    The Soviet academic community has made strict demands on this textbook. The editorial department of the "Communist" magazine published a review, and the Institute of Philosophy of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Higher Party School of the Central Committee of the CPSU have also discussed this textbook and have also put forward many opinions for our study and reference. An abridged translation of the former is published in the second issue of this year's "Study Translations," and an excerpted translation of the latter is published in the seventh issue of this year's "Study Translations."

    介绍“历史唯物主义”第二版

    苏联  康士坦丁诺夫主编  刘丕坤等译  人民出版社出版
    历史唯物主义是研究社会发展一般规律的科学，是认识社会现象的唯一正确的理论和方法，指导革命行动的工具和批判资产阶级唯心主义的武器。人民出版社最近出版的康士坦丁诺夫主编的“历史唯物主义”第二版的中译本，对我们学习这门科学将有很大的帮助。
    第二版的“历史唯物主义”分十二章。其中有一章是新增加的，有五章是把第一版中的两章或三章并成为一章了，其余也都经过认真的修改。篇幅比第一版缩减很多，而内容则比第一版更加充实了。
    生产力和生产关系发展的规律，是理解社会历史的钥匙。“生产力和生产关系的发展”一章阐明了这些规律。作者根据马克思列宁主义经典著作，特别是斯大林的“苏联社会主义经济问题”一书中的指示，着重地解释了生产关系一定要适合于生产力性质的规律。在讲述社会形态各阶段生产力和生产关系发展的各节中，指出这一规律是怎样贯彻着它的作用。作者还说明了社会主义制度下生产力同生产关系的矛盾特点和解决这种矛盾的途径，说明了社会主义制度下社会的发展是自觉地利用客观规律，但仍然要服从于客观规律的过程。这些都是比第一版显著地改进了的地方。
    新增加的“社会的基础和上层建筑”一章是十分重要的。它解释了基础对上层建筑的决定作用，上层建筑对基础的能动作用，基础和上层建筑的有规律的发展和更替。历史唯物主义的这些最基本原理，有很大的方法论意义。作者指出，基础和上层建筑的理论，“给整个社会关系总和的研究提供了指导线索”（一三○页），“使我们能够了解和研究社会革命、国家、法权、社会意识形态的发展规律”（一五五页）。
    作者在这一章里，又根据苏联的经验，指出了社会主义国家和社会主义思想体系在创立、发展和巩固自己的社会主义基础中的巨大作用。同时，作者还指出，“在建设社会主义社会当中，工人阶级还依据基础对上层建筑起决定作用这一客观规律。”（一四○页）这就是说，苏维埃政权和社会主义决不能长久建立在两个对立的经济基础上：一个是消灭资本主义成分的社会主义大工业，而另一个是产生资本主义成分的个体小农业。从这一点，就可以推论出在过渡时期必须不仅实行社会主义国家工业化，而且要对农业进行社会主义改造，才能把社会主义的统一、牢固的经济基础建设成功。
    苏联的这些经验，丰富了基础和上层建筑的理论，给各人民民主国家的社会主义建设政策提供了重要的理论根据。
    社会生活现象是复杂的，不能完全归结为基础或者上层建筑的范畴。如家庭，执行着社会物质生活条件之一的人口的繁衍这一必要职能，其形式是决定于经济关系的，但它也表现法权的、思想的和道德的关系。因此，家庭是既属于基础、又属于上层建筑的现象。而如语言，是使人们能够互相了解并在人们的一切活动范围中调整其共同工作的工具，是社会、人民的全部历史的产物，为社会一切阶级服务的，所以它是既不属于基础、也不属于上层建筑的现象。作者对这两种社会现象都有专节论述。
    还有文化对于基础和上层建筑的关系，也是应当深入探讨的。作者把文化区别为物质文化和精神文化。前者属于物质生活条件，属于社会的生产力；后者就其为社会意识形态而言，是属于上层建筑的现象。但无论是物质文化或精神文化，都有许多要素在许多时代为不同的基础和阶级服务，而每一个社会制度和阶级都按照自己的方式，根据自己的要求和目的来利用这些文化要素。
    作者又指出，文化发展中是有革命发生的，可是文化革命不仅不排斥文化发展中的历史联系和继承性，相反地以历史联系和继承性为前提。工人阶级正是为了创造社会主义文化而接受和改造过去的文化遗产的。这些对我们说来都是富有启发性的论述。
    对我们特别有现实意义的是“阶级和阶级斗争”和“人民群众和个人在历史上的作用”两章。
    在“阶级和阶级斗争”一章里，作者说明了阶级产生的原因，阶级斗争是对抗性社会的历史的动力，无产阶级是负有推翻资本主义和引导社会走向共产主义的使命的革命阶级，无产阶级的阶级斗争必然导致无产阶级夺取政权，以及无产阶级专政是阶级斗争在新形式中的继续。
    作者根据列宁的指示，告诉我们在向社会主义过渡的时期中，阶级斗争不是消失了，而是改变了斗争的形式，在许多方面成为更尖锐、更残酷的斗争。无产阶级夺得政权后的阶级斗争情况的基本变化，是无产阶级以统治阶级的资格来进行阶级斗争，利用国家政权全部工具来反对敌人。在这种新情况下，无产阶级阶级斗争的新形式是：镇压剥削阶级的反抗；消灭反革命叛乱的国内战争和抵御帝国主义侵犯的战争；国家对小资产阶级、特别是农民的领导，吸引他们到无产阶级方面来；使资产阶级专家为无产阶级服务，利用他们的经验、知识并改造他们；用新的纪律来教育全体劳动者，克服其中落后的集团和阶层因沾染了资本主义的习惯和传统而发生的同工人阶级利益相抵触的行为。如作者所说，苏联和各人民民主国家的经验都证实了列宁的原理；阶级斗争教训我们要对人民敌人保持革命警惕性和不可调和性。
    在“人民群众和个人在历史上的作用”一章里，作者说，“人民创造历史，首先是因为他们生产物质资料，他们用自己的劳动创造一切伟大的物质文化财富和精神文化财富，改变生产工具并发展社会的生产力。”（三五六页）
    不仅如此。在阶级社会里，主要是剥削阶级及其代表人物在政治生活方面起显著作用，可是人民群众的伟大作用仍表现在历史上。“在各种阶级斗争、民族解放战争和社会革命中，人民群众都起着积极的和决定的作用。”（三五九页）“虽然在过去的革命中人民群众通常都得不到胜利的果实，但是人民群众确是每次革命的主要的、决定的、突击的力量。”（三六○页）
    到了社会主义革命时代，人民群众的历史作用更有极大增长。关于这一点，这本教材的第二版阐发得更充分了。作者说，无产阶级及其领导下的劳动群众，在社会发展中的作用比奴隶和农奴大得多。在苏联和各人民民主国家里，“摆脱了政治、经济和精神的奴役的人民群众，表现出过去历史上从来没有的创造力量、主动性和英勇精神，使新社会有可能克服一切困难和正在发生的矛盾。”（三六二页）
    但是，主观唯心主义把历史的主要动力归结为杰出人物，而客观唯心主义则认为个人和人民都是超自然力的玩物。历史唯物主义摈斥种种唯心主义的谬论而说明历史的需要创造出杰出人物和杰出人物用历史所提供的条件去满足那需要，说明人的自觉活动对于历史必然性的影响和偶然性的作用。
    历史唯物主义在反对个人崇拜的同时，充分地估计到每个阶级的领袖人物，特别是无产阶级的领袖人物的作用。在这本教材的第二版中，作者指出了个人崇拜是同马克思列宁主义政党的集体领导原则相矛盾的，因为“它降低人民的作用和工人阶级及其政党的作用，瓦解并麻痹人民的力量”（三八三页）；也指出了无产阶级领袖人物的优良特征是同群众有密切联系，并且深信人民群众的创造力量。
    这本教材重视苏联的历史实践的经验，注意阐发跟社会主义社会发展规律有关的问题。对于这些问题，除了在几章中有专节论述以外，“社会主义社会发展的动力”和“从社会主义过渡到共产主义的规律性”两章中更作了专门的论述。在后一章中，关于共产主义两个阶段的特征，关于向共产主义过渡的经济前提和文化前提，以及关于向共产主义过渡的途径，都是在斯大林的“苏联社会主义经济问题”一书提出的原理基础上改写的。
    对资产阶级唯心主义的批判，在第一章中作了概括，其余各章中，特别是“社会物质生活条件”和“马克思列宁主义关于民族和民族解放运动的理论”等章中都有或多或少的接触。
    苏联学术界对这本教材提出了严格的要求。“共产党人”杂志编辑部发表了评论，苏联科学院哲学研究所和苏共中央高级党校等处讨论了这本教材，也都提出了很多可供我们学习参考的意见。前者的节译载于“学习译丛”今年第二期，后者的摘译载于“学习译丛”今年第七期。
