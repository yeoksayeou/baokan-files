　　Many parents of junior middle school and higher elementary school graduates in Sichuan's cities and towns are making arrangements for their children to participate in productive labor and self-study.

　　According to a survey in Wanxian Special District, about 40 percent of the junior middle school and higher elementary school graduates in the district's cities and towns who were unable to continue their studies will participate in production or work under the arrangement of their parents, and the rest can all be organized for self-study. In the urban area of Neijiang City, the parents of more than 1,000 past and current junior middle school and higher elementary school graduates who have not been able to continue their studies have made arrangements for their children to participate in production or self-study. Among them, more than 500 graduates will follow their parents to learn production skills such as sewing, spinning, blacksmithing, and bicycle repair, or participate in labor such as carrying and washing clothes. Ai Guangwu, a sewing worker in Daxi Street, Longchang County, taught his daughter Ai Shihua to sew after she graduated from elementary school and returned home, and asked her to help with bookkeeping and participate in youth group studies. He said to his daughter, "Don't worry if you can't continue your studies, you should obey the state plan. Participating in production at home can also help you improve." Ye Suhua, a junior middle school graduate in Chengdu who was unable to continue her studies, has learned handicrafts such as spinning and knitting socks from her mother. Every morning and evening, she also reviews her lessons and continues to improve her cultural knowledge. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　四川很多家长安排子女参加生产或自学
    四川许多城镇未升学的初中、高小毕业生的家长们，正在为子女参加生产劳动和自学作安排。
    据万县专区调查，全区城镇未能升学的初中和高小毕业生在家长安排下，约有百分之四十能参加生产或工作，其余的全部可以组织自学。内江市城区有一千多名未升学的往届和本届初中、高小毕业生的家长，已经为他们的子女参加生产或自学作好安排。其中有五百多名毕业生将跟随他们的父母学习缝纫、纺纱、打铁、修理自行车等生产技术或参加搬运、洗衣等劳动。隆昌县大西街缝纫工人艾光伍在他女儿艾世华从小学毕业回家后，就教女儿学习缝纫并要她帮助记账和参加青年组学习。他对自己的女儿说：“不能升学别着急，应当服从国家计划。在家参加生产一样能长进。”成都市未能升学的初中毕业生叶素华已经跟着她母亲学会了纺线、织袜子等手工，每天早晚，她还复习功课，继续提高文化知识。　（新华社）
