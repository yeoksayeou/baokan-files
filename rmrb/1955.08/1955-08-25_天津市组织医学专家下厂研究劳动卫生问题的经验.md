　　Tianjin's Experience in Organizing Medical Experts to Go to Factories to Study Labor Hygiene Problems
　　Feng Zhiying, Director of the Industrial Hygiene Department of the Tianjin Municipal Public Health Bureau

    The industrial hygiene work in Tianjin is led by the local health departments based on the instructions of the Party and the government. With the deepening of business leadership, factories and enterprises are asking to solve more and more specific problems in industrial hygiene work. Therefore, in addition to strengthening ideological and organizational leadership, we have also strengthened technical leadership and scientific research. On the one hand, we organized medical and health personnel from factories and enterprises to systematically study Soviet "Labor Hygiene" to improve their professional level; on the other hand, in 1954, we organized 16 units including municipal hospitals, specialized prevention and treatment institutions, the Chinese Medicine Society, higher industrial colleges, and relevant teaching and research groups in medical colleges in the city to establish a Labor Hygiene Research Committee to carry out scientific research.

    After the establishment of the Labor Hygiene Research Committee, the Public Health Bureau, based on the survey data, identified the common problems in factories and enterprises that seriously affected the health of workers, such as high temperature, acid mist, silicosis, and other occupational diseases and common diseases. It selected topics that urgently needed to be solved and could be solved, and formulated a unified research plan, which was handed over to each unit to formulate specific research plans and conduct research under the leadership of the Labor Hygiene Research Committee. This made the research closely integrated with production, and many practical problems could be solved quickly. We used professional meetings or circulars to introduce good experiences in a timely manner. At the same time, we also organized experts engaged in research to teach the research results to medical personnel in factories and enterprises through "Labor Hygiene" lectures. This combines administrative work, scientific research, and cadre training into one.

    The methods of organizing these units to go to factories to study labor hygiene problems are determined according to the nature of the research topic. One is a short-term investigation and research, the purpose of which is to cooperate with administrative work to conduct key investigations, or to conduct labor hygiene measurements according to the requirements of the factory, as a basis for improving labor conditions. For example, the personnel of the Public Health Teaching and Research Group of Tianjin Medical College conducted dust measurement in paper mills and stone powder plants, and conducted nutritional surveys of workers in steel plants; the personnel of the Health and Epidemic Prevention Station measured the acid mist concentration in acid plants; the Industrial Experiment Institute, Tianjin Medical College and other units conducted research on industrial poisons in factories, such as hydrogen sulfide gas in dyeing and finishing factories, benzene concentration in the air of rubber factories, and acetone in chemical plants. The Department of Neurology of the Municipal General Hospital cooperated with the prevention of gasoline poisoning to conduct physical examinations on workers using gasoline. Dermatologists and ophthalmologists of the hospital went to factories to study dermatitis caused by mineral oil and eye diseases caused by poor working conditions. The second is to go deep into the factory to conduct a relatively long-term systematic investigation of the causes of common diseases and occupational diseases, and to study prevention and treatment methods. In order to ensure the smooth progress of such research work, we have done some organizational work, requiring medical and health institutions and factories to cooperate for a relatively long period. At the same time, we provided support from the administrative aspect. For example, we organized the staff of the obstetrics and gynecology departments of four hospitals to establish technical guidance relationships with the maternal and child health stations of thirteen factories with many female workers, and conducted research on abortion problems; we organized the staff of two tuberculosis prevention and treatment hospitals to study the specific measures of factory tuberculosis prevention and control in key factories and to conduct silicosis research in the stone powder industry, creating experience for further carrying out factory tuberculosis prevention and silicosis prevention; the Dental Disease Prevention and Treatment Hospital cooperated with the Public Health Bureau to solve the acid mist problem in factories, conducted research and prevention of acid-corroded teeth; the Eye Hospital, together with the Industrial Experiment Institute, studied and solved the problem of hydrogen sulfide gas熏眼in dyeing and finishing factories; doctors from Xinhua Hospital affiliated to the Public Utilities Bureau worked with workers to study and solve the problem of ether poisoning. In factories, we have also started pilot application research of traditional Chinese medicine. Lu Guanhai, a famous Chinese medicine doctor in Tianjin, and the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine of the Municipal General Hospital, have provided prescriptions for treating menstrual diseases of female workers, which are being tested in two key factories in the Second District. Doctors from the Sixth District Health Center studied the use of Chinese medicine Gleditsia sinensis to prevent acid mist generated in metal pickling, and the effect was very good.

    Because the Public Health Bureau and the medical staff of various units actively researched various problems and provided many opinions on improving industrial hygiene work, these opinions have been valued and supported by the factory Party committees and administrative leaders, and with the cooperation of relevant factory units, many tasks have been carried out closely relying on the masses of workers, and the labor hygiene conditions in many factories have been initially improved. For example, in the prevention of high temperature, we found that some workers operating under air showers in the fourth branch of Tianjin Steel Plant experienced lower back pain. After our research, we found that the air shower wind speed was too high, reaching 9 meters per second (the Soviet Union stipulates that it should not exceed 6 meters per second), so we proposed a suggestion to reduce the wind speed, which basically prevented the continued occurrence of lower back pain among workers. In the research on the prevention of gasoline poisoning, we systematically studied and analyzed the causes of poisoning, and found that the causes of poisoning were mainly due to the poor quality of gasoline used, high volatility, improper use, poor workshop ventilation, lack of necessary personal protection and safety and health equipment, high labor intensity of workers, and poor health of workers, which increased the chance of poisoning. Therefore, we proposed to improve gasoline quality, improve tools, reduce gasoline volatilization, strengthen ventilation to eliminate gasoline vapor, and improve operating techniques to reduce contact, etc. to prevent poisoning; according to these principles, we summarized and introduced more than a dozen specific methods. As a result of adopting these methods in various factories, not only were gasoline poisoning accidents basically prevented, but also gasoline consumption was reduced. In the work of preventing acid mist, we summarized the experience of various factories and held professional meetings for exchange. A factory used alum and Cork Tree Bark to replace nitric acid for washing copper, and the effect was very good. After learning this experience, the Gongnongbing Musical Instrument Factory not only saved a lot of nitric acid for the factory, but also ensured the health of the workers. Obstetricians and gynecologists from various hospitals carried out the prevention and treatment of trichomonas vaginitis among female workers in factories, and also received good results. These research works appropriately cooperated with administrative work, thus not only protecting the health of workers, but also ensuring production.

    The factory visits of medical personnel greatly encouraged the workers and were warmly welcomed and supported by the factory. For example, when the obstetricians and gynecologists of the General Hospital went to the state-owned Tianjin No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory, the factory's Party and government leaders, the chairman of the trade union, medical staff and workers all came out to warmly welcome them. Medical personnel were also educated in the process of conducting research in the factory, improved their ideological understanding, broadened their horizons, and further clarified the importance of serving production. For example, Yang Ke, an obstetrician and gynecologist, worked continuously for eight hours at the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory. When asked if he was tired, he said, "Seeing the workers working so intensely, our work is nothing." Yuan Jiaqin, director of the Ophthalmology Department of Tianjin General Hospital, and Hao Min, a doctor from the Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Institute, said: Going to the factory once is equivalent to receiving an education. Chen Shijun, a doctor from the Department of Neurology of the General Hospital, realized in the research on the prevention of gasoline poisoning that it is necessary to implement the policy of prevention first in order to prevent the harm of gasoline to workers. He emphasized at the professional meeting that problems should be solved from preventive measures. In the course of going to factories for research, many doctors also improved their technical level and learned a lot of things from practice that were not available in books, such as the problem of hydrogen sulfide熏眼and the problem of gasoline causing skin to turn black. More importantly, medical personnel who often go to factories and medical personnel who conduct long-term chronic disease research in factories have gradually realized that it is necessary to face production, rely on workers, and implement the policy of prevention first in order to truly solve the problems of common diseases and occupational diseases of workers, and have a further understanding of the national health work guidelines and policies from practice.

    Although we have done some work in organizing and leading the labor hygiene research work of factories and enterprises, there are still many problems and shortcomings. First of all, the planning is not strong, and the requirements for research work are not clear enough, so that the overall plan cannot be well integrated into the plans of each unit, and therefore, experience cannot be summarized in time to improve the level of research work; some are carried out in a "piecemeal" manner, making the research work fragmented and passive. Secondly, we have failed to organize the research units well so that they can both cooperate and organically link up and cooperate closely with each other, preventing the scattered and isolated state of research work. Thirdly, technical leadership and scientific research work are still not keeping up with the requirements of business leadership, and not enough has been done to face heavy industry. Finally, we have also provided very little specific help to the medical and health personnel engaged in research work. These need to be overcome in the future work of further organizing medical personnel to go to factories to conduct scientific research, so as to improve the labor hygiene research work and make it better face production and ensure the smooth realization of socialist industrialization.

　　天津市组织医学专家下厂研究劳动卫生问题的经验
　　天津市公共卫生局工业卫生处处长　冯致英
    天津市的工业卫生工作业务，是由地方卫生部门根据党和政府的指示来领导的。随着业务领导的深入，各工厂企业要求解决的工业卫生工作中的具体问题越来越多。因此，我们在加强思想领导和组织领导以外，同时也加强了技术领导和科学研究工作。我们一方面组织了工厂企业的医务卫生人员，系统地学习苏联“劳动卫生学”，以提高他们的业务水平；一方面在一九五四年组织了本市各市立医院、各专科防治机构、中医师学会、高等工业院校、医学院校中有关的教研组等十六个单位，成立了劳动卫生研究委员会进行科学研究工作。
    劳动卫生研究委员会组成以后，公共卫生局便根据调查资料，找出各工厂企业中普遍存在的严重影响工人健康的问题，如高温、酸雾、矽肺以及其它职业病、多发病，选择急须解决而且可能解决的课题，拟出统一的研究计划，交由各单位分头拟定具体研究计划，在劳动卫生研究委员会的领导下进行研究。这样，使得研究工作能紧密地结合生产，许多实际问题能够迅速获得解决。对于好的经验我们都利用专业会议或用通报的形式及时作了介绍。同时，还组织进行研究工作的专家们把研究的成果通过“劳动卫生学”讲座，向各工厂企业医务人员讲授。这样就把行政业务、科学研究和培养干部结合为一体。
    组织这些单位下厂研究劳动卫生问题的方式方法是根据研究课题的性质来确定的。一种是短期的调查研究，目的在于配合行政业务工作进行重点调查，或者根据工厂的要求进行劳动卫生方面的测定，作为改善劳动条件的根据。例如天津医学院公共卫生教研组人员到造纸厂、石粉厂进行了粉尘测定，到钢厂进行了工人营养的调查研究；卫生防疫站人员对酸厂的酸雾浓度进行了测定；工业试验所、天津医学院等单位对工厂中的工业毒物，如染整工厂的硫化氢气体、橡胶厂空气中苯的浓度、化学厂的丙酮等进行了测定研究。市立总医院脑系科配合预防汽油中毒对使用汽油的工人进行了体格检查，该院皮肤科和眼科医师们分别下厂研究了矿物油引起的皮肤炎和因劳动条件不良而引起的眼病。第二种是深入工厂对多发病、职业病的发病原因进行比较长时期的系统的调查，并研究防治方法。为了保证这样的研究工作能够顺利地进行，我们作了一些组织工作，要求医疗卫生机构和工厂企业作比较长期的配合。同时，从行政方面予以支持。例如我们把四个医院的妇产科的工作人员组织起来，同十三个女工多的工厂妇幼保健站建立了技术指导关系，并进行了流产问题的研究；组织了两个结核病防治院的工作人员在重点工厂研究工厂防痨工作的具体措施和在石粉业中进行矽肺研究，为进一步开展工厂防痨工作和防治矽肺创造经验；牙病防治院配合公共卫生局解决工厂酸雾问题，进行了酸腐蚀牙齿的研究和防治；眼科医院会同工业试验所研究解决染整工厂中硫化氢气体薰眼问题；公用局所属新华医院医师同工人们一起研究并解决了乙醚中毒问题等。在工厂中我们还开始了试行应用中药的研究工作。天津市著名中医陆观虎和市立总医院中医科，都提供了治疗女工月经病的处方，正在二区两个重点工厂试行。六区卫生所医师研究了以中药皂荚防止金属酸洗中产生的酸雾，效果很好。
    由于公共卫生局和各单位医务人员下厂积极研究了各种问题，提供了许多改进工业卫生工作的意见，这些意见又得到了工厂党委和行政领导方面的重视和支持，取得了工厂有关单位的配合，紧密地依靠工人群众进行了许多工作，许多厂的劳动卫生状况已有初步改善。例如在防止高温工作中，我们发现天津钢厂四分厂在空气淋浴下操作的工人，有的发生腰疼现象。经过我们研究后，发现空气淋浴风速太大，达每秒九公尺（苏联规定不超过每秒六公尺），于是提出建议，减低了风速，基本上防止了工人腰疼现象的继续发生。在防止汽油中毒的研究工作中，我们对造成中毒的原因进行了系统地研究和分析，发现中毒的原因主要是由于使用的汽油质量差，挥发率大，加以使用方法不当，车间通风不良，缺乏应有的个人防护和安全卫生设备，工人劳动强度大，工人健康情况差等，以致增加了中毒的机会。因此，我们提出改进汽油质量，改进工具，减少汽油的挥发，加强通风以排除汽油蒸汽，改进操作技术以减少接触等原则来防止中毒；根据这些原则总结并介绍了十多项具体办法。各厂采用这些办法的结果，不仅基本上防止了汽油中毒事故，而且减少了汽油的消耗。在防止酸雾的工作中，我们总结了各工厂的经验，召开专业会议作了交流。某工厂使用黄矾、黄柏代替硝酸洗铜，效果很好。工农兵乐器厂学习了这一经验后，不仅为工厂节省了大量硝酸，而且保证了工人的健康。各医院妇产科医师在工厂女工中进行了滴虫阴道炎的防治，也收到很好的效果。这些研究工作适当地配合了行政业务，因而不仅保护了工人的健康，而且也保证了生产。
    医务人员的下厂，大大地鼓舞了工人们的情绪，并且受到了厂方的热烈欢迎和支持。如总医院妇产科医师们到国营天津第六棉纺织厂时，厂内党政领导人员、工会主席、医务人员和工人群众都出来热烈欢迎她们。医务人员在下厂进行研究工作中，在同工人接触当中也受到了教育，提高了思想认识，开扩了眼界，进一步明确认识了为生产服务的重要性。如妇产科专家杨珂医师到国营天津第二棉纺织厂一连工作了八小时，大家问他累不累，他说：“看看工人弟兄这样紧张地工作，我们这点工作，不算什么累。”天津总医院眼科主任袁佳琴医师和结核病防治所郝慜医师说：下一次厂等于受一次教育。总医院脑系科陈世畯医师在防止汽油中毒研究工作中，体会到必须贯彻预防为主的方针，才能防止汽油对工人的危害，他在专业会议上强调了从预防措施上解决问题。在下厂进行研究工作中，许多医师也提高了技术水平，从实际中学到了很多书本上没有的东西，例如硫化氢薰眼问题和汽油引起皮肤变黑问题等。更重要的是常常下厂的医务人员和在工厂中进行长期慢性疾病研究工作的医务人员，都逐步地体会到必须面向生产，依靠工人，贯彻预防为主的方针，才能真正解决工人多发病和职业病的问题，从实践中对国家卫生工作的方针政策有了进一步的认识。
    我们在组织领导工厂企业劳动卫生研究工作中，虽然作了一些工作，但还有许多问题和缺点。首先是计划性不强，对研究工作的要求不够明确，以致不能很好地将总的计划纳入各单位的计划，因而也就不能及时总结经验，提高研究工作的水平；有的则是“零打碎敲”地进行，使研究工作陷于零碎、被动。其次，是未能很好地组织各研究单位既能作到分工合作，又能作到有机联系，互相紧密配合起来，防止研究工作中的分散孤立状态。再次，是技术领导和科学研究工作还跟不上业务领导方面的要求，对于面向重工业作得不够。最后，我们对从事研究工作的医务卫生人员的具体帮助也很少。这些都需要在今后进一步组织医务人员下厂进行科学研究的工作中加以克服，以便把劳动卫生研究工作提高一步，使之更好地面向生产，保证社会主义工业化的顺利实现。
