    How the Soviet Union Implemented Grain Rationing During the First Five-Year Plan
    Meng Zhenhu

    Grain supply work is an important task in socialist construction. Because grain is not an ordinary consumer product, but "the treasure of treasures," people cannot live without it. Therefore, in the process of carrying out socialist construction, the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet state paid special attention to the work of grain supply.

    With the progress of socialist construction, the original cities and industrial and mining areas continued to expand, and new cities and industrial and mining areas were established one after another. A large number of agricultural populations turned to cities, and the ranks of the working class and the urban population grew rapidly. In order to cooperate with the development of industry, the areas of agricultural technical crops were also expanded accordingly. Due to the development of industrial and agricultural production and the increase in people's income, their demand for food, especially grain, has also greatly increased. However, the increase in grain production could not keep up with this need. The basic reason for this difficulty was not that the Soviet Union's grain production decreased, but that the growth rate of commodity grain production lagged behind the growth rate of commodity grain demand, and commodity grain decreased. The reason for the reduction of commodity grain was that the foundation of Soviet agricultural production at that time was a scattered small-scale peasant economy with very little grain commodity output. Therefore, to completely solve the problem of grain shortage, the fundamental way is to gradually transform the scattered small-scale peasant economy into a large collective farm economy and increase grain production.

    However, the transformation of the small-scale peasant economy is a long-term task. At that time, in order to ensure the speed of socialist industrialization stipulated by the Party, it was necessary to meet the grain needs of the urban and rural working people within an appropriate limit. In this way, it is necessary to take appropriate measures in terms of commodity circulation during the transformation of the small-scale peasant economy, in order to regulate the grain market, stabilize prices, and cooperate with the socialist construction cause.

    In order to further consolidate the state's position in the grain market and increase the grain resources controlled by the state, the Soviet state vigorously strengthened grain procurement work, strengthened the planning and management of the grain market, rectified and reorganized state-owned procurement agencies, expanded the state-owned and cooperative procurement networks, and stipulated the regional scope of state-owned and cooperative procurement agencies, prohibiting cooperatives from purchasing grain through private merchants and for private grain purchasers, and gradually squeezed private purchasers out of the procurement market. Strict administrative measures were taken against the rich peasant class that undermined the state's grain procurement. At the same time, the method of state grain procurement was also changed, and a pre-purchase contract system was implemented. In order to ensure the completion of the state's grain procurement plan, the state transported a large number of industrial products to the grain procurement areas in order to meet the farmers' needs for industrial products to the greatest extent. The above measures played a huge role in increasing the grain resources controlled by the state. In 1928, the Soviet state procured only 660 million poods of grain, and in 1930, the state procurement of grain had reached 1.35 billion poods. Although it suffered a drought in 1932, the procured grain still reached 1.4 billion poods (the above figures include collective farms' in-kind remuneration to machine tractor stations and processing enterprises).

    Although agricultural production continued to develop and the amount of grain procured by the state increased greatly, the phenomenon of grain supply falling short of demand still existed because the people's demand for grain grew faster. In addition, there were still free markets and speculative activities at that time, which made the grain problem more serious. If appropriate adjustments and distribution of grain supplies are not implemented in a timely manner, and the supply methods are not changed, urban workers and farmers in technical crop areas will not be able to buy grain, prices will fluctuate, and people's lives and the state's socialist construction will be seriously affected. Therefore, in addition to actively carrying out socialist transformation of the small-scale peasant economy, increasing grain production, and taking all measures to strengthen grain procurement work, the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet state also implemented a grain rationing system.

    The grain rationing system began to be implemented at the end of 1928. It was an effective method for supplying grain that had to be adopted under the conditions in the Soviet Union at that time. With the help of this system, the state can rationally use and distribute existing grain resources, ensure the grain supply to the people and industries in cities and industrial areas, and ensure the grain needs of farmers in agricultural technical crop areas. Its purpose is to save state grain, increase the consumption of the working class and other working people as much as possible, limit the consumption of the remnants of the exploiting classes in urban and rural areas, and eliminate the speculative activities of speculators who take advantage of the lack of grain.

    The Soviet grain rationing system implemented the principles of class and production. It requires that in determining the scope of national supply and the standards for quota supply, it is necessary to (1) first meet the needs of various departments of socialist construction; (2) the supply business must cooperate with the implementation of the production plan; (3) fight to eliminate the mobility of the working class in various enterprises; (4) stimulate the growth of labor productivity.

    The Soviet grain rationing system first started in individual cities and then gradually spread to large and medium-sized cities across the country. At the end of 1930, in order to better improve this system, the Soviet Union formulated a list of cities and a table of resident supply levels subject to state quota supply. It stipulated the scope of areas and the supply levels of residents for which the state was responsible for quota supply. The supply levels are divided into four types: special, first, second, and third class. The standard for special class supply is the highest, including workers and other laborers in Moscow, Leningrad, and Baku, as well as coal miners in Donbass, Shakhty, and Karaganda, underground workers in Kuzbass, and steel workers in Donbass. The first class includes workers and other laborers in the ferrous and non-ferrous metal industries. The second class includes workers in industrial sectors such as matches, papermaking, glass, and porcelain. The third class includes all other workers and laborers not included in the first three classes.

    With the increase in the amount of grain commodities controlled by the state, the number of people receiving state quota supply also increased year by year. In 1930, the number of people receiving state quota supply was 26 million, and in 1934 it increased to 40.3 million. All residents receiving state quota supply can go to commercial supply organizations with shopping vouchers issued by the government and buy the allocated grain at stable prices stipulated by the state. This guaranteed the living standards of the working people.

    In order to ensure the rational use of grain, supply the consumer market, and reduce transportation costs, the state stipulated fixed scopes of activity for grain sales by various grain procurement units. In the early stage of the implementation of the rationing system, the commercial organizations that directly supplied grain to consumers were mainly the consumer cooperative system. State-owned retail commerce had not yet developed at that time. However, consumer cooperatives did not complete the task of quota supply very well, and many cooperatives were stained with "a certain Nepman spirit." Therefore, in December 1930, the joint plenary session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Central Control Commission gave sharp criticism to the work of consumer cooperatives and passed corresponding resolutions. The resolution pointed out that in order to ensure the good progress of quota supply work, it is necessary to organize "worker special allocation cooperatives."

      "Worker special allocation cooperatives" are jointly organized by staff members of several enterprises, and a board of directors is elected by these members. The task of the "worker special allocation cooperatives" is not only to correctly distribute the commodities allocated by the state to the consumers, but also to find supplementary commodities to supply the needs of the members. In order to make the supply work more in line with the needs of consumers and ensure the implementation of graded supply, in 1930 the consumer cooperative system organized "special allocation stores" that served the staff of one or several enterprises.

    Even so, consumer cooperatives still could not undertake the task of supplying workers with food and industrial products, and there was still a disconnect between the supply work and the production plan. In order to make the supply work closely cooperate with the implementation of the enterprise production plan and strengthen the supervision of labor and consumption, in December 1932, the Soviet government and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) decided to establish "Worker Supply Departments" to replace "Worker Special Allocation Cooperatives." The "Worker Supply Department" is a form of state-owned trade and is a department attached to the factory enterprise. Its task is to be responsible for the supply work of the unit's employees under the direct leadership of the factory director or deputy director. With this organization, the factory director's authority to organize supply work within the factory was expanded, and the organization of the factory production process and the supply work for workers were unified into one agency. From January 1, 1933 to January 1, 1935, thousands of large factories, transportation companies, and state-owned farms in the Soviet Union organized more than 3,000 "Worker Supply Departments." The "Worker Supply Departments" supplied more than 20 million consumers. Experience has proved that organizing "Worker Supply Departments" to be responsible for the supply work of workers is completely correct. It guarantees the implementation of the production plan, guarantees that outstanding workers can receive priority supply, and stimulates the improvement of labor productivity.

    In addition to organizing "Worker Supply Departments" in large factories and enterprises, "Worker Special Allocation Cooperatives" are still retained in smaller enterprises, but their supply work is also increasingly supervised by the factory management office.

    During the period of the Soviet Union's implementation of the rationing system, in addition to the population receiving state quota supply, there were also vast rural and small city populations. The grain they needed was solved by their own production or local markets.

    In addition to the trade form of quota supply in areas where rationing was implemented, the Soviet Union also developed commercial trade from 1929 onwards that did not require the purchase of grain and food with shopping vouchers. This trade was initially opened for the non-laboring classes that were previously supplied by private stores. Its price was higher, so it helped increase state revenue. With the elimination of the exploiting classes, the purpose of this trade changed. It mainly served those experts and workers with higher wages, and its price was gradually reduced to a level close to the quota supply price. At this time, commercial trade became a supplementary form of quota supply, which played a great positive role in meeting the needs of high-paid laborers.

    Due to the successful implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, industrial production and rural grain production increased day by day. In order to further meet the needs of urban residents for grain, on the basis of the victorious realization of agricultural collectivization and the increasingly consolidated collective farm system, the Soviet state launched collective farm grain trade in cities, that is, the trade in which collective farms and collective farm members sold surplus grain after completing the state grain procurement plan and reserving sufficient seeds and feed, as an important supplementary source for supplying grain and other agricultural products to cities. The state strictly prohibited private merchants and speculators who attempted to gain profit from collective farm trade.

    In the process of socialist construction, the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet state paid great attention to and cared for the public catering industry, which can guarantee the dietary needs of the working people, and gave a high evaluation to its role. On August 19, 1931, the resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) pointed out: "The Central Committee believes that in order to thoroughly improve the supply work for the masses of workers, eliminate the mobility of labor, and complete the production and financial plans of industry, organizing and widely developing the public catering industry is of particular importance. The Central Committee reminds all cooperatives, party organizations, trade unions, and economic organizations to pay attention to the fact that due to the state's industrialization and the transition to a large socialist economy, the public catering industry is required to truly ensure that the broad masses of workers and their families can fully enjoy the supply of the public catering industry." Under the care of the Party and the government, the Soviet public catering industry has achieved rapid development, guaranteeing the supply of meals to millions of industrial populations in existing and newly built factories and construction sites. In 1932, the turnover of the public catering industry reached 4.852 billion rubles, supplying more than 70% of the workers in major industrial sectors with their dietary needs. The development of the public catering industry played a huge role in implementing the state's grain plan supply policy, helping the state overcome grain difficulties, and meeting the daily needs of the people.

    Due to the various methods adopted by the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet state, the urban and rural working people were able to get timely grain supplies in the event of grain shortages, and the people's labor enthusiasm was also improved, and the progress of socialist construction was guaranteed.

    In the process of socialist construction, the Soviet working class and other working people, under the leadership of the Party and the government, developed the spirit of hard struggle and assisted the Party and the government in overcoming the difficulties of grain shortages at that time. They were not intimidated by the grain shortages, but instead overcame all difficulties (including grain shortages) with active and selfless labor. The early completion of the Soviet Union's First Five-Year Plan is the most obvious proof of this active and selfless labor of the Soviet people.

    At present, we are fighting to complete the First Five-Year Plan, and we are also encountering grain difficulties. In order to guarantee socialist construction, increase the state's grain resources, guarantee the people's needs for grain, eliminate grain speculation, and overcome grain difficulties, our Party and government implemented the policy of planned grain purchase and planned supply in 1953, and now specifically stipulated the Interim Measures for Quota Supply of Grain in Towns and Cities and the Interim Measures for Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas, which are all very necessary and correct. All the people of our country should learn from the spirit of hard struggle of the Soviet people, resolutely implement the state's grain policy, overcome difficulties, save grain, actively labor, and fight for the construction of socialism.

    苏联第一个五年计划时期是怎样实行粮食定量供应的
    孟振虎
    粮食供应工作，是社会主义建设中的一项重要工作。因为粮食不是一般的消费品，而是“宝中之宝”，人们离开了它，便不能生活下去。所以，在进行社会主义建设的过程中，苏联共产党和苏维埃国家特别注意粮食的供应工作。
    随着社会主义建设的进展，原有城市和工矿区不断扩大，新的城市和工矿区相继建立，农业人口大批转向城市，工人阶级队伍和城市人口迅速增长。为了配合工业的发展，农业技术作物区也相应地扩大了。由于工农业生产的发展，人民收入的提高，他们对食品特别是粮食的需要也大大增加了。但是，粮食的增产却赶不上这个需要。产生这种困难的基本原因，并不是苏联的粮食生产量减少了，而是由于商品粮食产量的增长速度落后于商品粮食需要的增长速度，商品粮食减少了。商品粮食减少的原因，则在于当时苏联农业生产的基础是粮食商品出产量极少的分散的小农经济。因此，要彻底解决粮食困难问题，根本办法就是逐渐地把分散的小农经济变为大的集体农庄经济，增加粮食生产。
    但是，改造小农经济是一个长期的工作。而在当时，为要保证党规定的社会主义工业化的速度，却必须在适当限度内满足城乡劳动人民的粮食需要。这样，就必须在改造小农经济的过程中，从商品流通方面来采取适当的措施，以便调节粮食市场，稳定物价，配合社会主义建设事业的进行。
    为了进一步巩固国家在粮食市场上的地位，增加国家掌握的粮食资源，苏维埃国家大力加强了粮食采购工作，加强了对粮食市场的计划和管理，整顿和改组了国营采购机构，扩大了国营和合作社的采购网，规定了国营和合作社采购机构的地区范围，禁止合作社通过私商和为私人粮食采购者采购粮食，逐渐从采购市场上把私人采购商排挤出去。对破坏国家粮食采购的富农阶级采取了严厉的行政措施。同时，也改变了国家采购粮食的方法，实行了预购合同制度。为了保证国家粮食采购计划的完成，国家把大批工业品运送到粮食采购地区，以便最大限度地满足农民对工业品的需要。上述这些措施，对于增加国家掌握的粮食资源起了巨大的作用。一九二八年苏维埃国家所采购的粮食才有六亿六千万普特，一九三○年国家采购的粮食就已经达到十三亿五千万普特，一九三二年虽遭旱灾，但所采购的粮食仍达十四亿普特（以上数字均包括集体农庄对机器拖拉机站和加工企业的实物报酬在内）。
    虽然农业生产不断发展，国家粮食采购量大大增加，但是由于人民对粮食需要增长更快，粮食供不应求的现象仍然存在，加上当时还有自由市场和投机行为，这就使粮食问题更加严重。如果不及时地对粮食供应实行适当的调剂和分配，改变供应方法，城市工人和技术作物区的农民就会买不到粮食，物价就会发生波动，人民生活和国家社会主义建设就要受到严重的影响。因此，苏联共产党和苏维埃国家除了积极对小农经济进行社会主义改造，增加粮食生产，并采取一切措施来加强粮食采购工作以外，同时还实行了粮食定量供应制。
    粮食定量供应制，在一九二八年末开始实行，它是在苏联当时条件下必须采用的有效的供应粮食的方法。借助于这种制度，国家可以对现有的粮食资源加以合理使用和分配，保证城市和工业区人民和工业的粮食供应，保证农业技术作物区农民的粮食需要。它的目的是为了节省国家粮食，尽量增加工人阶级和其它劳动人民的消费量，限制城乡剥削阶级残余的消费量，杜绝投机商人利用粮食缺乏的机会来进行投机活动。
    苏联的粮食定量供应制度是贯彻着阶级原则和生产原则的。它要求在确定国家供应范围和定额供应标准时，要（一）首先要满足社会主义建设各部门底需要；（二）供应事业必须配合生产计划底执行；（三）为消灭各企业中工人阶级底流动性而斗争；（四）刺激劳动生产率底增长。
    苏联粮食定量供应制，首先从个别城市开始，以后逐步推广到全国大中城市。在一九三○年末，为了更好地健全这一制度，苏联制定了受国家定量供应的城市一览表和居民供应等级表。规定了国家负责定额供应的地区范围和居民的供应等级。供应等级分为特等、一等、二等、三等四种。特等表供应的标准最高，其中包括莫斯科、列宁格勒和巴库的工人和其他劳动者，还有顿巴斯、沙赫特、卡拉干达的煤矿工人和古兹巴斯的地下工人、顿巴斯的钢铁工人等。一等表包括黑色金属业和有色金属业中的工人及其他劳动者。二等表包括火柴、造纸、玻璃、磁器等工业部门的工人。三等表包括前三种表中未被列入的所有其他工人和劳动者。
    随着国家掌握粮食商品量的增多，受国家定量供应的人数也逐年增加了，一九三○年受国家定量供应的人数是二千六百万人，一九三四年增到四千零三十万人。凡是受国家定量供应的居民，都可持政府发给的购物证到商业供应组织去，按国家规定的稳定价格买得应分配到的粮食。这样，就保证了劳动人民的生活水平。
    为了保证合理地使用粮食，供应消费者市场，并减少粮食运输上的费用，国家对各粮食采购单位的粮食销售规定了固定的活动范围。在实行定量供应制初期中，直接把粮食供应给消费者的商业机构，主要是消费合作社系统，国营零售商业在当时尚未发展起来。但是消费合作社并没有很好地完成定量供应任务，很多合作社沾染了“某种耐普曼精神”。因此，在一九三○年十二月，联共（布）中央委员会和中央监察委员会联席全会便对消费合作社的工作给予了尖锐的批评，并通过了相应的决议。决议指出，为了保证定量供应工作的很好进行，要组织“工人特配合作社”。
      “工人特配合作社”由若干企业职工人员联合组织、并由这些成员选出理事会。“工人特配合作社”的任务不仅要把国家拨给它的商品正确分配到消费者手里，而且要寻找补充的商品来供应社员的需要。为使供应工作更切合消费者的需要，保证级差供应的实行，一九三○年消费合作社系统组织了专为一个企业或几个企业职工服务的“特配商店”。
    虽然如此，消费合作社仍然不能担负起供应工人食品和工业品的任务，供应工作和生产计划之间仍有脱节现象。为了使供应工作能密切配合企业生产计划的执行，加强对劳动和消费的监督，一九三二年十二月，苏联政府和联共（布）中央决定成立
  “工人供应处”，以代替“工人特配合作社”。“工人供应处”是国营贸易的一种形式，是附属工厂企业的一个部门，它的任务就是在工厂厂长或副厂长直接领导下负责本单位职工的供应工作。有了这种组织，工厂厂长在厂内组织供应工作的权限就扩大了，工厂生产过程的组织工作和对工人的供应工作就统一到一个机关中了。从一九三三年一月一日起到一九三五年一月一日止，苏联数千个大的工厂企业、运输公司和国营农场共组成了三千个以上的
  “工人供应处”。“工人供应处”供应的消费者达二千万人以上。经验证明，组织“工人供应处”来负责工人的供应工作是完全正确的，它保证了生产计划的执行，保证了优秀工作者能够得到优先的供应，刺激了劳动生产率的提高。
    除了在大的工厂企业组织“工人供应处”以外，在较小的企业中仍保留着“工人特配合作社”，不过它的供应工作也日益受到工厂管理处的监督。
    在苏联实行定量供应制期间，除了受国家定量供应的人口外，还有广大的农村和小城市人口。他们需要的粮食，是由自己生产或地方市场来解决的。
    在实行定量供应的地区，除了定量供应的贸易形式外，苏联从一九二九年起也发展了不用购物证购买粮食品的营业性贸易。这种贸易起初是为从前由私营商店供应的非劳动阶级开设的，它的价格较高，因而它对增加国家收入是有帮助的。随着剥削阶级的消灭，这种贸易的目的改变了，它主要为那些工资收入较多的专家、工人而服务，并且其价格亦逐渐减低到接近定量供应价格的水平。这时，营业性贸易就成为定量供应的一种补充形式，它在满足高薪劳动者需要方面起了很大的积极作用。
    由于第一个五年计划的顺利实现，工业生产和农村粮食生产日益增加，苏维埃国家为了进一步满足城市居民对粮食的需要，就在农业集体化胜利实现、集体农庄制度日益巩固的基础上，在城市中开展了集体农庄粮食贸易，即集体农庄和集体农庄庄员在完成国家粮食采购计划和留足种子、饲料之后出售余粮的贸易，作为供应城市粮食和其它农产品的重要补充来源。国家对企图从集体农庄贸易中取得渔利的私商和投机者是严格禁止的。
    在社会主义建设过程中，苏联共产党和苏维埃国家对于能够保证劳动人民饮食需要的公共饮食业，给予很大的注意和关怀，并对它的作用给予很高的估价。一九三一年八月十九日，联共（布）中央委员会的决议指出：“中央认为，为了彻底改善对工人群众的供应工作，消除劳动力的流动性和完成工业的生产财务计划，组织并广泛发展公共饮食业便具有了特殊重要的意义。中央提醒所有的合作社、党组织、职工会和经济组织注意一点，就是由于国家工业化和过渡到大的社会化经济，便要求公共饮食业真正地保证广大职工群众及其家属能充分地享受公共饮食业的供应。”在党和政府的关怀下，苏联公共饮食业获得了迅速的发展，保证了原有和新建工厂和建筑工地千百万工业人口膳食的供应。一九三二年公共饮食业的流转额达到四十八亿五千二百万卢布，供应了主要工业部门中百分之七十以上工人对饮食的需要。公共饮食业的发展，在执行国家粮食计划供应政策，帮助国家克服粮食困难，满足人民日常需要上起了巨大的作用。
    由于苏联共产党和苏维埃国家采取了上述种种方法，城乡劳动人民就可以在粮食困难的情况下，能够及时地得到粮食供应，而人民的劳动热情也就有了提高，社会主义建设的进展也就得到了保证。
    在社会主义建设当中，苏联工人阶级和其他劳动人民，在党和政府的领导下，发挥了艰苦奋斗的精神，协助党和政府克服了当时粮食不足的困难。他们不仅没有为粮食困难所吓倒，反而用积极的忘我的劳动战胜了一切困难（包括粮食困难在内）。苏联第一个五年计划的提前完成，就是苏联人民这种积极忘我劳动的最显明的证明。
    目前，我们正在为完成第一个五年计划而斗争，我们同样遇到了粮食的困难。为了保证社会主义建设，增加国家的粮食资源，保证人民对粮食的需要，杜绝粮食投机，克服粮食困难，我们的党和政府于一九五三年实行了粮食计划收购和计划供应政策，现在又具体规定了市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法和农村粮食统购统销暂行办法，这都是非常必要和正确的。我国全体人民应该学习苏联人民艰苦奋斗的精神，坚决贯彻国家的粮食政策，克服困难，节省粮食，积极劳动，为建设社会主义而斗争。
