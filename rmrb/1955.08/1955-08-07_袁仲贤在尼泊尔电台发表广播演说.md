Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 6th—Yuan Zhongxian, Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to Nepal, was invited on the 6th to deliver a radio speech on Nepal Radio. The full text of the speech is as follows:

　　I am very pleased to be invited to broadcast a speech to the Nepalese people, and take this opportunity to extend warm greetings on behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China to the government and people of our friendly neighbor.

　　China and Nepal have a long common border. The people of the two countries have had frequent economic and cultural relations since ancient times, and the friendship between the two peoples has a long tradition and history.

　　The Nepalese people have made brilliant achievements and great contributions in culture, art, philosophy, and religion. Nepal is the birthplace of the founder of Buddhism. More than a thousand years ago, it became a destination for Chinese Buddhists to pay homage. According to Faxian's records, he arrived in Nepal in 406 AD. Xuanzang visited Nepal around 635 AD. Their records praised the art and architecture of Nepal. Subsequently, the exchange of envoys between China and Nepal was extremely frequent.

　　In your country, known for its ancient civilization, I have seen that Nepalese architecture and sculpture are exquisite and delicate, fully demonstrating the talents and wisdom of the Nepalese people. I have also seen that your traditional agricultural technology is relatively good. At the same time, I see many new construction projects underway. The magnificence of your rivers and mountains and the simplicity, bravery, and diligence of the people have left a deep impression on me.

　　The Chinese people have always cherished the friendship and cooperation between China and Nepal. The establishment of Sino-Nepalese diplomatic relations will surely promote the existing friendship. Under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the relations between our two countries will greatly contribute to the prosperity and happiness of the two peoples.

　　In the two weeks since arriving in Kathmandu, we have been warmly welcomed and received by His Majesty the King and the government and people of your country. I would like to express our heartfelt gratitude here.

　　I wish the Nepalese people happiness and prosperity!
　　I wish the friendly relations between China and Nepal grow stronger day by day!
　　I wish peace in Asia and the world!

    袁仲贤在尼泊尔电台发表广播演说
    新华社新德里六日电　中华人民共和国驻尼泊尔大使袁仲贤六日应邀在尼泊尔广播电台发表广播演说。演说词全文如下：
    我很高兴受到邀请向尼泊尔人民作广播演讲，并借这个机会代表中华人民共和国政府和人民向我们友好的邻邦政府和人民热烈致意。
    中尼两国有很长的共同疆界。两国人民自远古以来就有频繁的经济和文化关系，两国人民的友谊有悠久的传统和历史。
    尼泊尔人民在文化、艺术、哲学和宗教上有过光辉造诣和伟大的贡献。尼泊尔是佛教创始者的诞生地。她在一千多年前就成为中国佛教徒朝礼的目标。根据法显的记载，他在公元四零六年就到达了尼泊尔。玄奘访问尼泊尔，大约在公元六三五年，他们的记载中都称道尼泊尔的艺术和建筑。其后中尼间使节往返曾极为频繁。
    在你们这个以古老文明著称的国度里，我看见了尼泊尔建筑和雕刻是精巧、细腻，充分地表现了尼泊尔人民的才艺和智慧。我也看到了你们传统的农业技术是较好的。我同时也看到许多新的建设工程在进行。你们河山的壮丽，人民的诚朴、勇敢和勤劳，给我以极深刻的印象。
    中国人民素来珍视中尼间的友谊和合作，中尼外交关系的建立必将促进现存的友谊。我们两国的关系在和平共处的五项原则的指导下，必将大大有助于两国人民的繁荣和幸福。
    在到达加德满都的两周内，我们受到国王陛下及贵国政府和人民的热烈欢迎和招待，谨在此表示我们衷心的谢意。
    祝尼泊尔人民的幸福和繁荣！
    祝中尼友好关系与日俱增！
    祝亚洲和世界的和平！
