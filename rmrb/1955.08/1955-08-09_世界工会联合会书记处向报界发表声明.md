Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, August 7th—TASS reports: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement to the press, expressing a heartfelt welcome to the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, scheduled to be held in Geneva from August 8th to 20th. The statement pointed out that the World Federation of Trade Unions has appointed a delegation consisting of Lama, member of the Executive Committee of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, Avila, Secretary of the International Transport, Ports and Fisheries Workers Union, Panikar, representative of the All-India Trade Union Congress, and Trinkwater to represent it at the conference.

The statement said that plans for the peaceful use of atomic energy to promote progress should first and foremost stipulate raising the living standards of the working masses and improving working conditions. This applies to industrially advanced countries, and even to a greater extent to underdeveloped countries.

The World Federation of Trade Unions demands that countries capable of producing atomic energy provide comprehensive assistance to other countries in using atomic energy for peaceful purposes, without infringing upon the sovereignty of these countries in any way.

The statement said that the World Federation of Trade Unions hopes to promote the implementation of these recommendations and firmly advocates that the relevant UN agencies, in consultation with international trade union organizations, determine measures for the peaceful use of atomic energy that can meet the interests of working people, guarantee their rights, and help to continuously improve their living and working conditions.

The statement concluded by stating that the World Federation of Trade Unions is prepared to cooperate with all international trade union organizations. The statement emphasized: Only on the basis of trade union solidarity can working people make an effective contribution to ensuring that atomic energy is used for peace and the benefit of working people, rather than for war purposes.

    世界工会联合会书记处向报界发表声明
    新华社八日讯　据塔斯社维也纳七日讯：世界工会联合会书记处向报界发表声明，表示衷心欢迎定于八月八日到二十日在日内瓦举行的和平利用原子能国际会议。声明指出，世界工联已经指定由意大利总工会执行委员会委员拉马，运输、港口与渔业工人工会国际书记阿维拉，全印总工会代表潘尼迦，德林克华特组成的代表团代表它出席这次会议。
    声明说，和平利用原子能以促进进步的计划首先应该规定提高劳动群众的生活水平，改善工作条件。这适用于工业先进的国家，而且甚至在更大的程度上也适用于落后国家。
    世界工会联合会要求能够生产原子能的各国在把原子能用于和平目的方面给予其他国家以全面的帮助，而丝毫不侵犯这些国家的主权。
    声明说，世界工会联合会希望促进这些建议的实施，坚决主张联合国各主管机构在同国际工会组织磋商下确定能够符合劳动人民的利益、保证他们的权利和帮助他们的生活和工作条件不断改善的和平利用原子能的措施。
    声明最后表示，世界工联准备同一切国际工会组织进行合作。声明强调：只有在工会团结的基础上，劳动人民才能在使原子能用来为和平和劳动人民的利益服务而不是为战争目的服务的工作中作出有效的贡献。
