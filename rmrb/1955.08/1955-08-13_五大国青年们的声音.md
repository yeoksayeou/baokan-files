    Voices of Youth from the Five Great Powers
    By our reporter Feng Zhidan
    On August 10th, a friendly gathering of youth representatives from China, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, France, and the United States was held in Warsaw's ancient Łazienki Park. Beneath the broad-leaved chestnut trees, young people from the five countries sat together, sipping cool lemonade, and discussing the issues they cared about. The five national flags fluttered side by side, each seeming to smile and greet the other four today.
    The weather in Warsaw in August is so pleasant, and people's hearts are so cheerful. The spirit of peace and friendship permeated these young people.
    Representatives from the five countries spoke one after another at the meeting, expressing the common desire of the people and youth of all countries for peace and international cooperation. Luo Yi, the Chinese representative, delivered a speech emphasizing the importance of the meeting of youth from the five great powers. Luo Yi expressed the unbreakable friendship of the Chinese youth with the Soviet youth and also expressed friendly feelings towards the British and French youth. When Luo Yi spoke of the friendship between Chinese youth and American youth, he said, "Although the US government occupies China's territory of Taiwan and is creating tension in the Taiwan region, we have always been friendly with the American people and youth. We do not want to fight with the American people. We hope to have more contact and exchanges with American youth, because mutual understanding and trust are the foundation for consolidating friendship." When Luo Yi mentioned inviting American youth to visit China, the entire audience stood up and applauded. The hands of Chinese youth and American youth were tightly clasped. The speeches of the Soviet, British, French, and American representatives all expressed satisfaction that the Geneva Conference provided a good start for the improvement of international relations, and they expressed their willingness to work together to promote further improvement of international relations. At this forum, each representative also pointed out the particularly important responsibility of the youth of the five great powers in the cause of defending peace. Each representative, at the end of his speech, shouted: Long live the friendship between the youth of the five great powers! Long live peace!
    American peace fighter and singing king Paul Robeson, due to the US government's refusal to issue him a passport, could not attend the festival, but he spoke to the youth of the five great powers through a tape recording, using his poetic language. He said that never in history have people demanded peace as urgently as they do now. Robeson said that although he could not come to Warsaw, his heart was with everyone. He called on the youth of the five great powers to unite and fight for the cause of peace and friendship. He said, "I clasp your hands tightly and sing with you for ideals, for hope, and for peace." Then Robeson sang a song familiar to everyone. His deep singing voice stirred the hearts of the young people.
    Here in Łazienki Park, the young people of the five great powers talked so freely and harmoniously, despite their different political ideologies and religious beliefs. Soviet youth singer Alikov and Chinese youth singer Su Fengjuan were discussing the art of singing. A young Soviet man and a young French woman aspiring to study Soviet literature were conversing. The French girl said, "The language of Soviet literature is so beautiful that I want to study it for the rest of my life." A Chinese university student, a young American actor, a student from the University of Manchester in England, a worker from a French chemical factory, and a Soviet athlete were chatting happily. They harmoniously discussed cultural and scientific exchanges, the Geneva Conference and the Paris Accords, and the issue of defending peace.
    New China is one of the topics that youth representatives often talk about. An American university student expressed his views on Sino-US relations. He said, "In the United States, some people say that we should not recognize the People's Republic of China because this country was created through revolution. But I want to ask these people in return: Wasn't the United States born out of the revolution of 1776?" Regarding the Taiwan issue, he said, "The American people simply cannot understand why the United States should interfere in Taiwan." British youth representative McKins announced in his speech: British youth believe that the People's Republic of China should have its seat in the United Nations restored. The words of our British friend won applause and cheers from the entire audience. I also met a young French woman named Marsan. She told me how much she yearned for New China and that she hoped to have the opportunity to visit Beijing. She said that a Frenchman who returned from New China wrote a song called "My Beijing Friend." This moving song is already popular among young people in France.
    On this beautiful Warsaw morning, the youth of the five great powers spent their unforgettable gathering. In addition to enjoying the cultural performances and engaging in friendly conversations, they finally unanimously passed a letter to the young men and women of the five great powers.
    The letter to the youth of the five countries said: "We know that our five countries have a special responsibility for achieving peace. That is why the friendship and cooperation between the youth of our five countries is so important.
    "We firmly believe that although our views and ways of life are different at present, there are many things that connect us together. These things are first and foremost the common desire that our great people, the youth of our countries, live in peace, happiness, and harmony. To achieve this great goal, we ask you, the young men and women of the five countries of England, France, the Soviet Union, the United States, and China, to urge your governments to continue their efforts to achieve disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, to establish a collective security system among our countries, to reunify Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis, and to discuss and resolve all outstanding international issues by peaceful means in the spirit of the United Nations Charter."
    The letter to the youth of the five countries calls on the youth and youth organizations of the five great powers to engage in direct contact in the spirit of the Geneva Conference in order to further develop the friendly cooperation between the young men and women of the five countries.

    五大国青年们的声音
    本报记者　冯之丹
    八月十日，在华沙古老的拉森克公园里举行了中、苏、英、法、美五大国青年代表友好的聚会。在宽叶的栗子树下，五个国家的青年坐在一起喝着清凉的柠檬水，交谈着他们所关心的问题。五面国旗并排地飘扬着，每一面国旗今天好像都在向其它四面国旗微笑致意。
    八月的华沙，天气是这样的宜人，人们的心里是这样的舒畅。和平与友好的精神洋溢在这些年青人的中间。
    五个国家的代表一个个在会上发言，他们表达了各国人民和青年要求和平和国际合作的共同愿望。中国代表罗毅致词，强调了五大国青年会见的重要意义。罗毅表达了中国青年同苏联青年的牢不可破的友谊，也表达了对英、法青年的友好的感情。当罗毅谈到中国青年同美国青年的友谊时，他说：“虽然美国政府占着中国领土台湾，并在台湾地区制造着紧张局势，但是我们同美国人民和青年一直是友好的。我们并不要同美国人民打仗。我们希望更多地同美国青年接触来往，因为相互了解和信任是巩固友谊的基础。”罗毅在提到邀请美国青年访问中国时，全场都起立鼓掌。中国青年和美国青年的手紧紧地握在一起了。苏联、英国、法国和美国代表的发言，都满意地指出日内瓦会议给国际关系的改善提供了一个良好的开端，并且表示要共同努力来促进国际关系的进一步改善。在这个讲坛上每个代表也都指出五大国青年在保卫和平事业中的特别重要的责任。每个代表在结束他的发言时，都高呼：五大国青年之间的友谊万岁！和平万岁！
    美国和平战士、歌王保罗·罗伯逊由于美国政府拒绝发给护照，不能来参加联欢节，但是他通过录音带，用他诗一般的语言向五大国青年讲了话。他说，从来没有一个历史时期人们要求和平像现在这样迫切。罗伯逊说，虽然他不能来华沙，但是他的心却和大家在一起。他呼吁五大国青年团结一致，为和平和友谊的事业而斗争。他说：“我紧握着你们的手，同你们一起歌唱理想、歌唱希望和和平。”接着罗伯逊唱起了为大家所熟悉的歌。他的深沉的歌声激动着年青人的心。
    这里在拉森克公园，五大国的年青人是交谈得多么地自由和融洽，尽管他们中间有着政治思想和宗教信仰的不同。苏联青年歌唱家阿力可夫和中国青年歌唱家苏凤娟在谈论着歌唱艺术。一个苏联男青年和一个有志于学习苏联文学的法国女青年在交谈。那个法国姑娘说：“苏联文学的语言太美了，所以我要终生研究它。”一个中国的大学生，一个美国的年青演员，一个英国曼彻斯特大学的学生，一个法国化学工厂的工作员和一个苏联运动员在欢叙着。他们和谐地谈论了文化科学的交流，谈论了日内瓦会议和巴黎协定，谈论了保卫和平的问题。
    新中国是青年代表们常常谈到的话题之一。一位美国大学生发表了他对于中美关系的看法。他说，“在美国有人说我们不应该承认中华人民共和国，因为这个国家是经由革命产生的。但是我要反问这些人：难道美国不是经由一七七六年的革命而诞生的吗？”关于台湾问题，他说：“美国人民根本不能理解美国为什么要去干涉台湾。”英国青年代表麦金斯在发言中宣布：英国青年认为中华人民共和国应该恢复它在联合国的席位。我们的英国朋友的话赢得了满场的掌声和欢呼。我也曾遇到法国的女青年玛桑。她告诉我，她是怎样地向往着新中国，她希望能有机会到北京去作客。她说有一位法国人从新中国回去，写了一首歌叫“我的北京朋友”。这支动人的歌已在法国年青人中间流行了。
    在这个美丽的华沙的上午，五大国青年度过了他们难忘的聚会，他们除了欣赏文艺节目和进行友谊的交谈之外，最后一致通过了告五大国男女青年书。
    告五国青年书说：“我们知道，我们五个国家对取得和平负有特别的责任。这就是为什么我们五个国家的青年之间的友好和合作是如此重要的原因。
    “我们深信，尽管目前我们的见解和生活方式不同，但是有许多东西把我们联系在一起。这些东西首先是希望我们伟大的人民、我们国家的青年生活在和平、幸福与和谐中的共同愿望。为了达到这个伟大的目标，我们要求你们，英、法、苏、美、中五国青年男女，敦促你们的政府继续努力，以达到裁军和禁止原子武器、建立我们各国之间的集体安全体系、在和平和民主的基础上重新统一德国和本着联合国宪章的精神用和平方法讨论和解决一切悬而未决的国际问题。”
    告五国青年书要求五大国的青年和青年组织本着日内瓦会议的精神进行直接接触，以进一步发展五国青年男女之间的友好合作。
