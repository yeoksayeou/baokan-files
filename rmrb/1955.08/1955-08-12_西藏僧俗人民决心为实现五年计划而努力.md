Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, August 10th: National People's Congress Representatives Living Buddha Chijiang, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, and Sampo Tsewang Rigzin successively gave talks to our agency's reporters, endorsing the various resolutions passed by the Second Session of the First National People's Congress.

    Living Buddha Chijiang said that the first Five-Year Plan passed by this meeting is a great undertaking of socialist construction in China, and it has far-reaching and long-term benefits for all ethnic groups. The Kang-Tibet and Qing-Tibet highways included in the first Five-Year Plan are like beams of light shining into Tibet. It has only been over half a year since the road opened to Lhasa, and it has already brought great benefits to the Tibetan people. It has even more significant meaning for Tibet's future construction. Living Buddha Chijiang believes that the motherland's economic construction is of great significance to all ethnic minority areas. Under the glorious light of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy, all ethnic groups have united like steel. In the future, as long as we are more united and work together, the Five-Year Plan will definitely be completed. He said that the Tibetan monastic and secular people are determined to strive for the fulfillment of the Five-Year Plan.
    Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme said that the scale of the Five-Year Plan is very large, and its completion will certainly greatly help the construction of Tibet. As the motherland becomes stronger and richer day by day, Tibet will never stop moving forward. With a prosperous and strong motherland, there will definitely be a prosperous and happy new Tibet. Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme believes that the Kang-Tibet and Qing-Tibet highways are part of the Five-Year Plan, and the project was very arduous, but we all united and built it. In the future, other construction projects can certainly be completed.
    Sampo Tsewang Rigzin said that the preparatory work for the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region Preparatory Committee is currently underway. Under the leadership and care of the Central Government, some historical outstanding issues of the Tibetan local government, the Kashag, and the Panchen Kampotz Council have been resolved. In the future, we must consolidate and continue to strengthen internal unity in Tibet, strive to build Tibet, consolidate national defense, and unite with all fraternal ethnic groups to accomplish the great mission given to us by the motherland. Sampo Tsewang Rigzin finally expressed that he is prepared to conduct propaganda among the monastic and secular people in the Shigatse area, mobilizing them to work with full confidence for the realization of the first Five-Year Plan.

    西藏僧俗人民决心为实现五年计划而努力
    新华社拉萨十日电　全国人民代表大会代表赤江活佛、阿沛·阿旺晋美、詹东·计晋美先后向本社记者发表谈话，拥护第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议通过的各项决议。
    赤江活佛说，这次会议通过的中国的第一个五年计划，是中国进行社会主义建设的伟大事业，对各族人民都具有远大的、长远的利益。包括在第一个五年计划以内的康藏、青藏两条公路，像光一样射到了西藏；通车到拉萨才半年多的时间，它就给西藏人民带来很大的利益，它对西藏今后的建设更有着重大的意义。赤江活佛认为，祖国经济建设对各民族地区的意义都是很大的。各民族在毛主席民族政策的光辉照耀下，已经像钢铁一样地团结起来了，今后只要更加团结一致，共同努力，五年计划一定能够完成。他说，西藏僧俗人民决心为实现五年计划而努力。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美说，五年计划的规模很大，它完成后对西藏建设的帮助也一定很大，祖国一天天富强起来，西藏决不会停止不前；有了繁荣富强的祖国，就一定有繁荣幸福的新西藏。阿沛·阿旺晋美认为，康藏、青藏两公路是五年计划的一部分，工程是非常艰巨的，但我们大家团结把它修成了。今后对其他建设也一定可以完成。
    詹东·计晋美说，现在成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的准备工作正在进行。在中央的领导和关怀下，西藏地方政府噶厦和班禅堪布会议厅委员会的一些历史悬案已经得到解决。今后我们要巩固和继续加强西藏内部的团结，努力建设西藏，巩固国防，同各兄弟民族团结一道，来完成祖国所给予的伟大使命。詹东·计晋美代表最后表示，准备向日喀则地区僧俗人民进行宣传，动员他们为实现第一个五年计划而信心百倍地努力。
