    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 11th (Dispatch): Saigon News: The South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem government issued a statement on the 10th regarding the Vietnamese general election issue, refusing to hold a consultative conference with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and to hold a general election in Vietnam in accordance with the Geneva Accords.

    At the beginning of the statement, the Ngo Dinh Diem government denied its undeniable obligation to the Geneva Accords, stating that "it believes that it is in no way bound by the Geneva Accords, which it never signed."

    In the statement, the Ngo Dinh Diem government portrayed itself as advocating "unification of the whole country in peace and freedom" and pretended not to oppose "the principle of free elections." However, it then falsely accused North Vietnam of not having "conditions for free life and free voting," thus rejecting the proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to hold a consultative conference and general election.

    吴庭艳政府发表声明
    表示拒绝举行协商会议和普选
    新华社河内十一日电　西贡消息：南越吴庭艳政府十日就越南普选问题发表声明，拒绝按照日内瓦协议同越南民主共和国政府举行协商会议和在越南举行普选。
    吴庭艳政府在这个声明的一开头就抵赖它对日内瓦协定承担的不可推托的义务说，“它认为它丝毫不受它未曾签字的日内瓦协定的约束”。
    吴庭艳政府在声明中把自己说成好像是主张“在和平和自由中统一全国”的，并且装作不反对“自由选举的原则”。可是，它接着就颠倒黑白地诬蔑越南北方没有“自由生活和自由投票的条件”，就这样拒绝了越南民主共和国政府提出的举行协商会议和普选的建议。
