Responses to Criticism and Suggestions

    A letter from the General Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building: The criticism in the "Letters from Readers" page on July 24 regarding our ministry's violation of financial discipline is correct. When running a primary school for the children of our staff, we one-sidedly considered the welfare of the staff and did not implement the state's financial system. We are determined to correct this practice in the future.

    A letter from the Office of the Kaifeng Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party: The criticism in the "Letters from Readers" page on July 24 that "the phenomenon of stockpiled equipment and materials in many factories in Kaifeng is very serious" is consistent with the facts. The Municipal Committee has instructed the Industrial Department and the Municipal Bureau of Industry to actively handle the matter: materials that can be allocated within the city will be allocated immediately; those that cannot be resolved within the city will be reported to the higher-level authorities for assistance. This work is actively underway.

    A letter from the Office of the Datong Mining Bureau: The criticism in the "Letters from Readers" page on July 24 that our Second Mine should not use the "killing the chicken to get the eggs" method for production is correct. The Datong Second Mine did have a tendency to "emphasize production while neglecting machinery and electricity" in the past. We have now conducted a self-examination from top to bottom and taken measures to improve our work.
