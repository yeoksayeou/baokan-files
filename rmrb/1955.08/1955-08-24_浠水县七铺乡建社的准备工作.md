　　Preparatory Work for Establishing Cooperatives in Qipu Township, Xishui County
　　Jiang Feng
　　Qipu Township is a key township in Xishui County, Hubei Province. Before the spring of last year, it piloted two agricultural production cooperatives, which increased to eleven cooperatives after the autumn harvest. Most of the cooperatives developed after the autumn harvest last year were established under the requirements of production and disaster relief and under the influence of the old cooperatives. The foundation was weak and preparations were insufficient when the cooperatives were established. After the cooperatives were established, they were not rectified and consolidated in time, and there were many problems. Due to insufficient leadership, several mutual aid teams spontaneously transformed into agricultural cooperatives after the flood. In May of this year, rectification was carried out, and several cooperatives that did not meet the requirements and spontaneous cooperatives were transformed into mutual aid teams. There are currently ten cooperatives in the township, with 231 members, accounting for 16.6% of the total number of farm households in the township. There are also 65 mutual aid teams with 504 members. Nearly half of the township is still made up of individual farmers.

　　Although there are many problems in the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the township, most of the cooperatives are well-run. In particular, the two old cooperatives have shown greater advantages. The "Changjiang" No. 1 cooperative achieved increased production despite the disaster, and the "Xinsheng" No. 1 cooperative overcame great difficulties in production and disaster relief. These achievements have had a great impact on the farmers in the township, and many mutual aid teams are preparing to establish cooperatives after the autumn harvest.

　　There are 21 party members in this township. Some party members do not have enough understanding of leading farmers on the road to collectivization, are unwilling to lead the establishment of cooperatives, and do not understand the policies for running cooperatives. Based on the current situation and the shortcomings of last year's work, the party branch believes that this year it is necessary to make preparations for establishing cooperatives as early as possible, plan and arrange this year's work of developing agricultural cooperatives after the autumn harvest, strengthen the leadership of the party, and avoid blindness and passivity. The preparatory work is divided into the following three steps:

　　First, the branch studies the situation in the township, initially determines the targets for establishing cooperatives, and identifies the problems in the past mutual aid and cooperation movement and the reasons for these problems as the experience and lessons for establishing cooperatives this year. After research, the branch committee initially determined nine groups as targets for transformation into cooperatives after the autumn harvest. Then, it convened a general meeting of the branch to unify the ideological understanding of the party members. At the meeting, it criticized some party members' negative and erroneous ideas of not wanting to run cooperatives, and made party members realize the importance of strengthening the party's leadership over the collectivization movement. After unifying ideological understanding, it specifically studied the targets for establishing and expanding cooperatives. It initially determined to build five new cooperatives after the autumn harvest, and also studied the candidates for the heads and accountants of the new cooperatives. Finally, it was decided that five members of the branch committee would be assigned to specifically help the target groups to prepare for establishing cooperatives. The issue of expanding the old cooperatives was also studied, and it was proposed to strengthen the leadership of the mutual aid teams.

　　Second, convene a representative meeting of mutual aid and cooperation in the township. According to the spirit of the branch meeting, explain the principles and plans for developing agricultural cooperatives to the masses, put forward the conditions for establishing and expanding cooperatives, and the objects initially determined by the branch, and let everyone discuss them. During the discussion, the conditions that the mutual aid team must meet before transforming into a cooperative were put forward: 1. Comprehensively improve production, requiring an average increase of 10% compared with individual farmers, and overcome all difficulties to ensure that the mutual aid team does not disintegrate. 2. Unite and benefit each other, arrange work reasonably, the assessment of the base points should be fair, the wages should be reasonable, and ensure that the work is cleared and accounts are settled on time. 3. Ensure that all members of the group understand the specific policies for running cooperatives. 4. Democratic leadership, cultivate fair and capable group leaders, deputy group leaders, technicians, and work recorders as the leading backbone for future cooperative establishment. 5. Obey the national plan and actively complete the state-prescribed unified purchase and sales tasks. Two principles were put forward for the target groups for establishing cooperatives: 1. When a mutual aid team transforms into a cooperative, it is not necessary for all members of the group to join the cooperative. Those who are not willing should wait for their awareness. Absolutely no coercion is allowed; after the group transforms into a cooperative, it should help the members who do not join to participate in other mutual aid teams. If they are willing to work individually, they should also be allowed. 2. The establishment of a cooperative should not be done by "drawing tendons", only absorbing the backbone of the mutual aid team and causing the mutual aid team to collapse. If the backbone of a mutual aid team is willing to join the cooperative, most of the members are unwilling to join the cooperative, and the group cannot continue to operate well after the backbone joins the cooperative, they should be persuaded to leave one or two backbones in the group to continue to run the mutual aid team well and prepare conditions for establishing a cooperative. The situation of "establishing a cooperative, dismantling a mutual aid team, and increasing individual farmers" must never be allowed to happen again. The representative meeting also proposed that if the object group currently identified does not meet the conditions at the time of cooperative establishment, do not rush to transform into a cooperative; mutual aid teams that have not been identified as objects now can also actively strive for it, and if they meet the conditions at the time of cooperative establishment, the branch should actively lead them to transform into cooperatives.

　　Third, strengthen the party's leadership over the object groups for establishing and expanding cooperatives. Branch committee members are assigned to help five object groups preparing to establish cooperatives. Branch committee members and the heads and deputy heads of the old cooperatives often go to the mutual aid teams to help solve problems and conduct education. Cultivate three to five backbones in each object group to improve their leadership skills and make them gradually understand the management methods of the cooperative. At the same time, through visits and comparisons between groups and between groups and cooperatives, promote these object groups to further improve production.

　　In the process of preparing for the establishment of cooperatives, the education on the superiority of cooperatives and the specific policies of cooperatives is also widely and deeply carried out, so that each member of the group and individual farmers can recognize the direction of rural development in the future and the benefits of joining the cooperative. Let them know how to deal with land, cattle, farm tools, production investment, and how to distribute them when joining the cooperative, and eliminate their various misunderstandings and concerns about the cooperative.

　　The plan and preparatory work for the establishment of cooperatives in Qipu Township after the autumn harvest have received a good response from the masses. Most of the mutual aid teams in the township have expressed that they will strive to create conditions for the establishment of cooperatives. Many mutual aid teams have checked production, actively invested in topdressing fertilizers, and some groups are preparing to engage in sideline businesses or reclaim wasteland for growing vegetables and beans in an effort to increase production. The mutual aid teams that have been identified as objects for cooperative establishment are in even higher spirits, and the members of the group have expressed that they will strive to be members of an agricultural cooperative.

　　浠水县七铺乡建社的准备工作
　　江烽
    七铺乡是湖北省浠水县的重点乡，去年春季以前试办了两个农业生产合作社，秋后增加到十一个社。去年全乡大部分受了水灾，秋后发展的一批社，大多是在生产救灾的要求和老社的影响下建立起来的。建社时基础较差，准备不够，社建成后又没有及时整顿巩固，问题很多。由于领导不够，水灾后又有几个互助组自发地转为农业合作社。今年五月进行了整顿，几个不够条件的社和自发社转成了互助组。全乡现有十个社，社员二百三十一户，占全乡总农户的百分之十六点六，有六十五个互助组、五百零四户组员。全乡还有将近半数是个体农户。
    虽然乡里互助合作运动有很多问题，但是大多数社还是办好了。特别是两个老社显示了更大的优越性。“长江”一社受了灾还做到全社增产，
  “新生”一社在生产救灾中克服了很大的困难，这些成绩，对全乡农民影响很大，有不少互助组都准备秋后建社。
    这个乡共有二十一个党员，部分党员对于领导农民走合作化道路认识还不够，不愿意领导办社，不懂得办社的政策。党支部根据当前情况和去年工作的缺点，认为今年一定要及早作好建社准备，把今年秋后发展农业合作社的工作加以计划安排，加强党的领导，避免盲目和被动。准备工作的进行约分为如下三步：
    第一步，支部研究全乡情况，初步确定建社对象，并找出过去互助合作运动中的问题和产生这些问题的原因，作为今年建社的经验教训。支委会经过研究，初步确定九个组作为秋后转社的对象。接着召开支部大会，统一党员的思想认识，会上批评了一些党员不愿办社的消极错误思想，使党员认识到加强党对合作化运动领导的重要性。思想认识统一后，具体研究了建社、扩社对象。初步确定秋后新建五个社，并对新建社的社长和会计人选也作了研究，最后决定由支委五人分工具体帮助对象组进行建社准备。对老社扩大问题也作了研究，并提出要加强对互助组的领导。
    第二步，召开全乡互助合作代表会，根据支部会议的精神，向群众讲明发展农业合作社的方针计划，提出建社扩社的条件和支部初步确定的对象，让大家讨论。讨论中提出互助组转社前必须具备的条件，一、全面搞好生产，要求比单干农民平均增产一成，克服一切困难保证互助组不散伙。二、团结互利，合理排工，底分评定要公平，工资要合理，保证按时清工结账。三、要使全体组员都懂得办社的各项具体政策。四、领导民主，要培养公道能干的正副组长、技术员和记工员，作为将来建社的领导骨干。五、服从国家计划，积极完成国家规定的统购统销任务。对于建社对象组提出两条原则：一、互助组转社时不一定全组所有组员都要全部入社，不自愿的户要等待觉悟，决不能勉强；组转社后，应帮助不入社的组员参加别的互助组，如愿意单干，也应允许。二、建社不能以“抽筋”办法，只吸收互助组的骨干入社而使互助组垮台。如果一个互助组的骨干愿意入社，大部分组员不愿意入社，而骨干入社后组又不能继续办好，应该说服一、二骨干留在组里继续办好互助组，准备条件办社。“建立了合作社、拆垮了互助组、增加了单干户”的情况绝不允许再发生。代表会上还提出现在确定的对象组，到建社时如果条件不够也不要急于转社；现在没有确定为对象的互助组，也可以积极努力争取，到建社时具备条件，支部应当积极领导他们转社。
    第三步，加强党对建社、扩社对象组的领导。支部委员分工帮助五个准备建社的对象组，支委和老社的正副社长经常到互助组去帮助解决问题，进行教育。在每个对象组里培养三、五个骨干，提高他们的领导能力，使他们逐渐了解合作社的经营管理办法。同时通过组同组、组同社之间的参观评比，推动这些对象组进一步搞好生产。
    在准备建社的过程中，还广泛深入进行合作社优越性和合作社具体政策的教育，使每个组员和个体农户认识到今后农村发展的方向和入社的好处。使他们知道入社时如何处理土地、耕牛、农具、生产投资以及如何分配等问题，消除他们对合作社的各种误解和顾虑。
    七铺乡秋后建社的计划和准备工作已经在群众中得到良好的反应，全乡大部分互助组都表示要努力争取创造建社条件。不少互助组纷纷检查生产，积极投资追肥，有的组准备搞副业或开荒种菜、种豆，争取增加生产。被确定为建社对象的互助组，情绪更高，组员们都表示要争取做一个农业合作社的社员。
