　　Give Full Play to the Role of Existing Industrial Base
　　——An Important Topic of the Second Tianjin Municipal Party Congress of the CPC
　　Wang Zuo

    In order to implement the spirit of the National Congress of the Party, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CPC recently convened the Second Tianjin Municipal Party Congress. In this meeting, the tasks undertaken by Tianjin in the national first five-year plan construction was one of the important topics.

    Tianjin has achieved results in implementing the national first five-year plan in the past two years. State-owned industries and joint state-private industries have overfulfilled the national plan every year, and the completion of the city's basic construction plan has also improved year by year. In the past two years, the total amount of social commodity circulation in the city has greatly increased, and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce has also made great progress. This year, Tianjin has made overall arrangements for the main parts of local industries, industry by industry, stabilizing the production of some previously difficult industrial sectors, reducing or stopping the phenomenon of work stoppages and unemployment, and strengthening the planning of production and trade work.

    In order to better complete the national first five-year plan, it is necessary for Tianjin cadres to further clarify the tasks undertaken by Tianjin in the national first five-year construction plan. These are: to make full use of existing equipment, give full play to the role of existing industrial bases, and vigorously support new industrial bases in terms of manpower, materials, and financial resources; to produce more, better, and cheaper industrial products to meet the needs of the people; to gradually bring capitalist industry and commerce into various forms of state capitalism, and to gradually organize handicraftsmen and suburban farmers. In order to complete these tasks well, it is extremely important to fully mobilize the masses, increase production, practice comprehensive economy, and oppose all waste.

    These tasks undertaken by Tianjin in the national first five-year plan require all departments in the city to have a clear overall view. However, the importance of this issue has not been fully understood by every comrade in the past. The representatives attending the meeting examined and criticized the erroneous view of "being fond of the new and big" and neglecting the important role of old industrial and mining enterprises in the first five-year plan. Representative Gu Zhu, one of the former heads of the local state-owned industry bureau, examined his own mentality of liking to build large factories and looking down on small enterprises in leading local industries in his speech. The local state-owned industry bureau always thought that small enterprises had no prospects and were unwilling to operate them; or blindly and rashly merged them without careful planning beforehand, dividing them after merging them, and transferring them repeatedly, causing serious losses to the country. He believes that the country is currently carrying out key construction and requires the concentrated use of funds, and local state-owned industries must give full play to the capabilities of existing enterprises, and this mentality of liking the new and big is in conflict with the spirit of the central government's instructions.

    Representative Wang Peiren, the person in charge of the Construction Bureau, examined and criticized the mistake of pursuing quantity and speed in municipal construction and dispersing national funds. Wang Peiren said that although he fully supported the policy of concentrating efforts on developing heavy industry during the first five-year plan, he always felt that "more is better than less" when specifically deciding on municipal construction funds, and he was not satisfied with less, and even strived to increase it, always wanting to ask the higher authorities for more money and do more projects. Under the guidance of this idea, some projects that could be built later were built earlier, and some projects that could adopt lower standards adopted higher standards. For example, the Nankai Erwei Road construction project this year is neither a major urban and rural transportation route nor has a great relationship with production and transportation. The Jintang Bridge revetment project is not urgently needed for flood control and can also be postponed. In the past, it was thought that doing so was "for industrial production" and "starting from the interests of the people." In fact, this practice of not distinguishing between priorities and urgency is a manifestation of egalitarianism and decentralism of "everything is being rebuilt" and "large-scale everywhere." The result is to disperse national funds and affect key construction.

    After discussion, the representatives realized that the mentality of liking the new and big is a manifestation of subjectivism that does not proceed from reality. If we do not give full play to the role of the original industrial base in the country's construction according to the national key construction policy and the characteristics of Tianjin, it will inevitably affect the rapid establishment of new bases and affect the progress of the country's socialist industrialization.

    The conference held in-depth discussions on the issue of practicing comprehensive economy and opposing all waste. Everyone believed that in the past few years, Tianjin has achieved certain results in increasing production and practicing economy under the leadership of the central government, but the phenomenon of waste is still serious. Representatives from all sides exposed the very serious waste in various departments and links.

    In industrial production, the waste of raw materials and labor caused by blindly purchasing equipment and raw materials, "using big materials for small purposes" or "using good materials for inferior purposes," and the large backlog of finished products and semi-finished products is very serious. According to statistics, in the first quarter of this year, 20 state-owned factories in the city had a backlog of more than 30 million yuan in working capital. This is inseparable from the erroneous thinking of some comrades who believe that now "the family is big and the business is big," wasting "a little bit is nothing," "costs have been reduced a lot," "there is no waste," "whatever you do, you waste," and only care about completing tasks without asking about economic results. Representative Cui Ronghan, Minister of Local Industry of the Municipal Party Committee, criticized the phenomenon of waste in industrial production and made a self-criticism. He said that the local industrial authorities had not seriously fought against the bourgeoisie's disregard for state property in the past. He proposed that in the future, the idea of everything for socialist industrialization should be further established inside and outside the party, the concept of economic accounting should be strengthened, a regular savings system should be established, and a mass savings movement should be launched.

    The representatives of the financial and trade system unanimously believed that the phenomenon of waste in the financial and trade system is also widespread and serious. It is manifested in: poor management, slow capital turnover, many errors and accidents, and constant liability incidents, and even goods are abandoned on the ground and no one cares. Liu Gongran, a representative of the party organization of the domestic trade system, exposed the fact that the monopoly company did not plan well in advance when building large wine storage tanks, which caused a series of wastes. In 1954, the monopoly company ordered 86 large wine storage tanks. Originally, the ordered tanks were already excessive, exceeding the maximum storage capacity. More seriously, the monopoly company did not carefully consider how to use these tanks and where to store them before designing and manufacturing them, so that there was no place to store the tanks after they were made. The company's staff ran around and built a simple warehouse, which could store more than 60 tanks; however, due to poor design and construction, the warehouse was blown down by strong winds in June this year; the remaining tanks were stored in various wholesale departments, but some wholesale departments had doors that were too small, so they had to build sky bridges to transport the tanks into the yard, but the house doors were too narrow, so they had to remove the door walls to reluctantly install them. As a result, the tanks were too high and the houses were too short, making them inconvenient to use, and the roofs had to be dismantled and repaired before they could be used. In connection with the above-mentioned incidents and various waste situations in the domestic trade system, Liu Gongran examined the serious bureaucratic style, complacency, and weak political and ideological leadership of the leading aspects of the domestic trade system. And pointed out that the domestic trade system often excuses itself for its large tasks, heavy business, and wide contacts, and problems are inevitable, etc., and cannot seriously deal with liability accidents, and also complains that the leadership criticizes too much and provides too little concrete help.

    The representatives also exposed and criticized serious mistakes such as pursuing formalism and poor construction quality in basic construction. Many representatives exposed the unreasonable phenomenon in the establishment of Tianjin's administrative organs and enterprises, and also criticized many departments for displaying many sofas and carpets in meeting rooms and offices, and often holding banquets to entertain guests, etc., which is a waste of money. The representatives also put forward many opinions and suggestions on the issue of saving food and rectifying food unified sales work.

    Through this meeting, the representatives deeply understood that saving is a fundamental measure to accumulate construction funds and realize the historical task of my country's socialist industrialization, and it is a long-term and regular political task of the whole party and the whole people. They have a clearer understanding of the importance and necessity of practicing comprehensive economy and opposing all waste. The representatives not only exposed the waste in various aspects, but also put forward many specific and feasible measures and methods. After discussion, it was determined that the task of saving 70 million yuan for the country in the next six months. The meeting required all units in the city to immediately and conscientiously mobilize the masses without exception, to further check and expose all waste phenomena in various aspects and links, find out the reasons, formulate savings plans, and earnestly implement them. At the same time, it is necessary to widely carry out publicity and education among the people so as to create a social atmosphere of thrift, mobilize everyone to practice comprehensive thrift, oppose all waste, and strive to complete and overfulfill the task of saving 70 million yuan by the end of the year!

　　充分发挥现有工业基地的作用
　　——中共天津市第二次代表会议的一个重要议题
　　王左
    为了贯彻党的全国代表会议的精神，最近，中共天津市委员会召开了天津市第二次代表会议。在这次会议中，天津市在国家第一个五年计划建设中所担负的任务问题是重要议题之一。
    天津市在过去两年中执行国家第一个五年计划是有成绩的。国营工业和公私合营工业，历年都超额完成了国家计划，全市的基本建设计划的完成情况，也逐年有所改进。两年多来，全市的社会商品流转总额有了很大的增长，对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，也有了很大的进展。今年天津市在地方工业的主要部分中，逐行逐业进行了统筹安排，使若干原来比较困难的工业行业，生产得到了稳定，减少或停止了停工失业的现象，加强了生产和贸易工作的计划性。
    为了更好地完成国家第一个五年计划，必须使天津市干部进一步明确天津市在国家第一个五年建设计划中所担负的任务。这就是：充分利用现有设备，发挥现有工业基地的作用，在人力、物力、财力等方面大力支援新建工业基地；生产更多、更好、更廉价的工业产品，供应人民需要；逐步地把资本主义工商业分别纳入各种形式的国家资本主义的轨道，逐步地把手工业者和郊区农民组织起来。为了很好地完成这些任务，充分发动群众，增加生产，厉行全面节约，反对一切浪费，就具有极为重大的意义。
    天津市在国家第一个五年计划中所担负的这些任务，要求全市各个部门必须具备明确的全局观点。但这个问题的重要性在过去并不是已经为每个同志所充分了解的。参加会议的代表检查批判了那种“喜新好大”，忽视旧有工矿企业在第一个五年计划中的重大作用的错误观点。代表顾柱、前地方国营工业局负责人之一，他在发言中检查了自己领导地方工业中的喜欢建设大工厂、看不起小型企业的喜新好大思想。对于小型企业，地方国营工业局总认为没什么搞头，不愿经营；或者盲目草率地大并大合，事前没有周密的计划，并了又分，辗转迁移，给国家造成严重损失。他认为：目前国家正在进行重点建设，要求集中使用资金，地方国营工业必须充分发挥旧有企业的能力，这种喜新好大的思想是和中央指示精神相抵触的。
    建设局负责人王培仁代表检查批判了市政建设中贪多、贪快，分散国家资金的错误。王培仁说虽然他完全拥护在第一个五年计划期间集中力量发展重工业的方针，但是在具体决定市政建设经费时，总觉得“多比少好”，少了就觉得不满意，甚至力争增多，总想向上级多要点钱，多做点工程，在这种思想指导下，有些工程可以晚建的早建了，可以采取较低标准的而采取了较高的标准。如今年修建的南开二纬路道路工程，既不是城乡交通要道，对于生产运输的关系也不大。金汤桥护岸工程对于防洪来说并非急需，也是可以缓办的。而过去还认为这样做是“为了工业生产”、“从人民利益出发”的。实际上，这种不分轻重缓急的作法，是“百废俱兴”、“处处大规模”的平均主义分散主义思想的表现，其结果是分散国家资金，影响重点建设。
    经过讨论，代表们认识到：喜新好大的思想是不从实际出发的主观主义的表现。如果不根据国家重点建设的方针，不根据天津市的特点，充分发挥原有的工业基地在国家建设中的作用，就必然会影响新基地的迅速建立，影响国家社会主义工业化的进展。
    对于厉行全面节约，反对一切浪费问题，会议进行了深入的讨论。大家认为：几年来，天津市在中央的领导下，增产节约工作是有一定成绩的，但浪费现象仍然是严重的。来自各方面的代表，对于各个部门和各个环节上的十分严重的浪费现象，进行了揭发。
    在工业生产上，由于盲目采购设备和原材料，
  “大材小用”或“优材劣用”，成品、半成品大量积压等等而造成的原材料、劳动力的浪费现象是十分严重的。据统计，在今年第一季度中，全市二十个国营工厂就积压流动资金三千多万元。这是和某些同志认为现在“家大业大”、浪费“一星半点不算什么”、“成本降低很多了”、“没有什么浪费现象了”、“干什么糟踏什么”，以及只管完成任务不问经济效果等错误思想分不开的。市委地方工业部长崔荣汉代表批评了工业生产上的浪费现象，并作了自我批评。他说：地方工业主管部门过去没有认真地同漠视国家财产的资产阶级思想展开斗争。他提出：今后在党内外应当进一步树立一切为了社会主义工业化的思想，加强经济核算观点，建立经常的节约制度，开展群众性的节约运动。
    财经贸易系统的代表们一致认为：财经贸易系统的浪费现象也是普遍而严重的。表现为：经营管理不善、资金周转慢、差错事故多、责任事件不断发生，甚至货物抛弃在地上而无人过问。国内贸易系统党组织代表刘公然揭发了专卖公司建造储酒大罐时事先计划不周而造成一系列浪费的事实。一九五四年，专卖公司订制了储酒大罐八十六只。本来，订制的大罐已经过多，超过了最高储存量，更严重的是，专卖公司在设计制造之前并没有周密考虑这批罐子如何利用，存放何处，以致大罐造成后无处存放。公司的工作人员四处奔走，修了一个简易库房，可以存罐六十多只；但是，又因为设计不周，施工不善，今年六月间库房竟被大风刮倒；其余大罐虽分存于各批发部，但有的批发部因大门太小，只能采取搭天桥的办法，把大罐运进院去，可是屋门又窄，不得不拆除门墙，勉强安装，结果罐高房矮，使用不便，还得拆修房顶，才能使用。联系上述事件和国内贸易系统的各种浪费情况，刘公然检查了国内贸易系统领导方面严重的官僚主义作风、骄傲自满情绪和政治思想领导不强等缺点和错误。并且指出，国内贸易系统常常以自己任务大、业务繁重、联系方面很广，发生问题在所难免等为借口来原谅自己，有了责任事故，不能认真处理，而且埋怨领导批评多，具体帮助少。
    代表们还揭发批判了基本建设方面追求形式和施工质量低劣等严重错误。许多代表揭发了天津市的行政机构和企业单位在编制上的不合理现象，也批评了许多部门在会议室、办公室内陈设许多沙发、地毯，动辄举行宴会招待客人等铺张浪费现象。对于节约粮食，整顿粮食统销工作问题，代表们也提出了许多意见和建议。
    通过这次会议，与会代表深刻地了解到节约是积累建设资金，实现我国社会主义工业化这一历史任务的根本措施，是全党和全民的长期的、经常的政治任务，对于厉行全面节约，反对一切浪费的重要性和必要性，思想上更加明确了。代表们不但揭发了各个方面的浪费现象，并且提出不少具体的、切实可行的措施和办法。经过讨论，确定今后半年中要为国家节约七千万元的任务。会议要求全市各个单位，无例外地立即认真发动群众，进一步检查和揭发各个方面和各个环节中的一切浪费现象，找出原因，订出节约方案，认真执行。同时，要在人民群众中广泛地进行宣传教育，以便在社会上造成一种节约的风气，动员大家起来厉行全面节约，反对一切浪费，为完成和超额完成到年底节约七千万元的任务而努力！
