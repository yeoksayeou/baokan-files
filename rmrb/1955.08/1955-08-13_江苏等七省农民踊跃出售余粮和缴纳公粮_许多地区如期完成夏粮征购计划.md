    Farmers in Seven Provinces Including Jiangsu Enthusiastically Sell Surplus Grain and Pay Agricultural Tax; Many Regions Complete Summer Grain Purchase Plans on Schedule

    (Our Newspaper News) Farmers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong, Hebei, Hubei, and Hunan are enthusiastically selling surplus grain and paying agricultural tax to the state. Many regions have completed their summer grain collection and purchase plans on schedule.

    As of August 5th, farmers in Jiangsu Province had sold more than 1.1 billion jin of wheat to the state. The province's summer grain unified purchase plan has been completed. Before selling wheat, farmers throughout the province listened to publicity about the unified purchase and sale policy for grain, especially the benefits of fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales of grain, and generally reflected that the government's methods are becoming more and more thorough. Farmers in Sanduo Township, Xinghua County, sold all the wheat they should sell to the state in mid-July according to the township's unified purchase targets. Farmers in areas that suffered from floods last year but achieved a bumper wheat harvest this year with the help of the Party and the government are even more actively selling wheat. After suffering from floods last year, farmers in Shazhuang Township, Binhai County, received 4,500 yuan in relief funds and loans from the government, as well as 130,000 jin of grain in assistance. After the wheat harvest this year, they sold the more than 90,000 jin of wheat they should sell to the state in one go.

    As of August 3rd, the amount of early rice stored in Zhejiang Province had increased by more than one and a half times compared to the same period last year. In the Wenzhou Special District, where early rice was first marketed, farmers have sold more than 80 million jin of surplus grain. As of the end of July, 483 agricultural producers' cooperatives in Yin County and Yuyao County, Ningbo Special District, had signed grain sales contracts with the state grain purchasing departments, preparing to sell 20 million jin of grain to the state. Grain sales in areas where early rice is marketed have decreased significantly. In July, grain sales in the Wenzhou Special District decreased by 12.3 percent compared to June.

    Anhui Province has successfully concluded its summer agricultural tax collection work this year, with the total amount of public grain stored reaching 101.74 percent of the assessed target. Fuyang and Chuxian Special Districts, as well as Bengbu, Suixi, Xiao County, and Dangshan cities and counties, have overfulfilled their tasks. In the unified purchase of summer grain, Anhui Province simultaneously arranged grain unified sales work. More than 2,000 townships in the Huaibei Plain, the main wheat-producing area, that have completed the unified purchase of summer grain have roughly determined the supply figures for grain-deficient households in July and August; the remaining 1,170 townships that are carrying out unified purchase work are verifying grain unified sales figures.

    As of August 2nd, Shandong Province had completed 101.93 percent of its summer tax collection task; the grain sold by farmers to the state also reached 66 percent of the province's unified purchase task. In the summer tax collection and purchase, the vast number of farmers deeply realized the correctness of the "three fix" policy and happily paid public grain and sold surplus grain.

    Hebei Province's summer grain collection and unified purchase work has been completed on schedule according to the original plan. As of the end of July, the amount of wheat stored in the nine special districts of the province had reached 99.78 percent of the original plan. The four special districts of Tianjin, Tangshan, Tong County, and Baoding, which have done a better job, have exceeded the original plan. While carrying out grain collection and unified purchase, all localities also carried out grain unified sales work for July, August, and September.

    Hubei Province has had a bumper harvest of early rice on both sides of the Yangtze River. In recent days, farmers in more than 20 counties along the river and lakeside have been using boats or vehicles to transport rice to nearby state grain stations for sale. State grain stores in Xiaogan, Huangpi, and other counties are overwhelmed every day from dawn to dusk. Wolong Township, Xiaogan County, which suffered from floods last year, sold a total of 666,600 jin of early rice. According to statistics as of the end of July, the amount of grain stored in the province already accounted for 78.53 percent of the summer purchase task.

    This year, Hunan Province has had a bumper harvest of early rice, and farmers are enthusiastically selling early rice to the state. As of the end of July, the province had purchased more than 16 million jin of early rice. At present, the daily market volume continues to increase. In order to do a good job in early rice purchase, Changde and Xiangtan Special Districts, which account for 85 percent of the province's early rice area, promptly organized a large number of cadres to go to the countryside and established temporary purchasing stations. State grain markets and some rural grain supply stations in various counties have also made the purchase of new rice their main business.

    江苏等七省农民踊跃出售余粮和缴纳公粮
    许多地区如期完成夏粮征购计划
    本报讯　江苏、浙江、安徽、山东、河北、湖北、湖南等地农民踊跃向国家出售余粮和缴纳农业税。许多地区已如期完成夏季粮食征收和收购计划。
    到八月五日止，江苏省农民已卖给国家十一亿多斤小麦。全省夏粮统购计划已经完成。全省各地农民在出售小麦前，听了粮食统购统销政策特别是关于粮食定产、定购、定销的好处的宣传，普遍反映政府的办法越来越周到。兴化县三垛乡农民在七月中旬就按照乡的统购指标，把应该出售的小麦全部卖给国家。去年遭受水灾、在党和政府援助下今年获得小麦丰收的地区，农民更积极出售小麦。滨海县沙庄乡农民去年遭受水灾后，得到政府四千五百元救济款和贷款、十三万斤粮食的支援，今年麦收后，就把应卖给国家的九万多斤小麦一次卖出。
    浙江省到八月三日止，早稻入库数量比去年同期增加一倍半以上。早稻上市最早的温州专区，农民已出售八千多万斤余粮。宁波专区鄞县、余姚两县到七月底止，已有四百八十三个农业生产合作社同国家粮食收购部门订立了售粮合约，准备把二千万斤粮食卖给国家。早稻上市地区的粮食销售量已显著下降。七月份，温州专区的粮食销售量比六月份下降百分之十二点三。
    安徽省今年农业税夏征工作已胜利结束，入库公粮总数已达到核定指标百分之一百零一点七四。超额完成任务的有阜阳、滁县两个专区和蚌埠、濉溪、萧县、砀山等市县。安徽省在夏粮统购中，同时安排了粮食统销工作。小麦主要产区淮北平原已经完成夏粮统购任务的两千多个乡，大体上订出七、八月份缺粮户的供应数字；其余正在进行统购工作的一千一百七十多个乡，正核实粮食统销数字。
    山东省到八月二日止，已完成夏征任务的百分之一百点九三；农民卖给国家的粮食也达全省统购任务的百分之六十六。在夏征夏购中，广大农民深深体会到“三定”政策的正确，愉快地缴纳公粮和出售余粮。
    河北省夏季粮食征收和统购工作已按原订计划如期完成。到七月底，全省九个专区入库的小麦已达原计划的百分之九十九点七八。工作较好的天津、唐山、通县、保定等四个专区都超过了原订计划。各地在进行粮食征收和统购的同时，还进行了七、八、九月份的粮食统销工作。
    湖北省长江两岸早稻丰收。连日来，沿江滨湖二十多个县的农民，正用船或车载着稻谷，涌向附近的国家粮站出售。孝感、黄陂等县的国家粮店，每天从天亮到黄昏应接不暇。去年曾经遭受水灾的孝感县卧龙乡，共卖出早稻六十六万六千多斤。根据截至七月下旬为止的统计，全省入库的粮食即已占夏季征购任务的百分之七十八点五三。
    今年湖南省早稻丰收，农民踊跃地把早稻售给国家。截至七月底止，全省已经收购早稻一千六百多万斤。目前每日上市量仍不断增加。为了做好早稻收购工作，占全省早稻面积百分之八十五以上的常德、湘潭两专区，及时组织大批干部下乡，建立了临时收购站。各县的国家粮食市场和部分农村粮食供应站，也都以收购新稻为主要业务。
