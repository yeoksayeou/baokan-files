Xinhua News Agency, 25th. Li Zaiwen, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke to a reporter from this agency on the State Council's promulgation of the "Provisional Measures for Grain Rationing in Cities and Towns."

    Li Zaiwen said: The provisional measures for grain rationing in cities and towns are an important measure related to grain work in the national economic construction plan. This supply system divides urban workers of various occupations into grades based on the intensity of their labor, and provides different supply quantities according to their grades. Appropriate rations are also provided for residents and children. We believe that, based on China's grain production situation, this grain distribution method is reasonable. It can both guarantee supply and promote grain conservation, which is beneficial to the country and the people.

    Trade union organizations at all levels should actively assist people's committees at all levels and administrative units of factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, and schools in assessing the grain supply grades of workers. In implementing the provisional measures for grain rationing in cities and towns, trade union organizations at all levels must repeatedly publicize and explain to workers and their families, so that they can correctly understand the important significance of implementing these measures and actively implement them.

    He then spoke about how trade union organizations should lead workers to conscientiously practice grain conservation after the implementation of the rationing system. He said that trade union organizations at all levels have done a lot of work on grain conservation. Some trade union organizations have made grain conservation an important part of their efforts to promote the increase production and practice economy movement. For example, in 1954, the Changsha Municipal Federation of Trade Unions mobilized the majority of workers, especially catering management personnel, cooks, and workers' families, to actively manage food well and save grain. It also mobilized workers in related grain processing, storage, and transportation departments to save grain by improving their work. State-owned soy sauce factories in Liaoning Province are implementing a method of not adding or adding less caramel coloring to soy sauce. It is estimated that in 1955, this will save the country 800,000 jin of grain. Workers at the state-owned Tianjin Winery experimented with using distiller's grains, which were previously regarded as waste, to replace grain for making koji to brew wine. In just over a month from February to March this year, they saved more than 60,000 jin of grain. After the entire factory adopted this method in production, it is estimated that about 1.2 million jin of grain can be saved throughout the year.

    Li Zaiwen said: However, not every worker fully understands the important significance of saving grain, and the phenomenon of wasting grain still exists. Some canteens have stockpiled grain and have not stored it properly, resulting in moldy grain. There are also serious phenomena of wasting grain in grain processing, storage, transportation, and industries that use grain as raw materials. In 1954, a total of 6,235 grain transportation accidents occurred on national railways, ranking first among various transportation accidents. After the implementation of the provisional measures for grain rationing in cities and towns, it will have a great effect on promoting grain conservation among the masses of workers and reducing or avoiding waste. The working class must resolutely support the provisional measures for grain rationing in cities and towns and become a good example of implementing these measures. It is necessary to plan household grain consumption well according to the grain supply rations, save more grain for the country, and enable the country to have the necessary grain reserves. We believe that the enlightened Chinese working class will certainly play an exemplary role in this work.

### 中华全国总工会书记处书记栗再温发表谈话　号召全国职工积极执行粮食定量供应办法

　　中华全国总工会书记处书记栗再温发表谈话
　　号召全国职工积极执行粮食定量供应办法
    新华社二十五日讯　中华全国总工会书记处书记栗再温就国务院公布的关于“市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”对本社记者发表谈话。
    栗再温说：市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法是国家经济建设计划中有关粮食工作的重要措施。这个供应制度对于城市中各种不同职业的劳动者，根据他们劳动的轻重分成等别，按其等别给予不同的供应数量，对于居民和儿童的粮食供应也作出了适当的定量。我们认为根据我国的粮食生产情况，这种粮食的分配办法是合理的，它既能保证供应，又能促进粮食节约，对国家对人民都是有好处的。
    工会各级组织应当积极地协助各级人民委员会和厂矿、企业、机关、学校行政单位，评定职工的粮食供应等别。在贯彻市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法中，工会各级组织必须对职工和职工家属进行反复的宣传解释工作，使他们正确地认识实施这个办法的重要意义，从而积极地贯彻执行。
    他接着谈到工会组织在实行定量供应制度以后应该领导职工认真实行粮食的节约。他说，工会各级组织对于节约粮食曾经做了不少的工作，有些工会组织在开展增产节约运动中把节约粮食作为重要内容之一。如长沙市工会联合会在一九五四年发动广大职工特别是伙食管理人员、炊事人员和职工家属积极办好伙食，节约粮食，并发动有关粮食加工保管和运输部门的职工从改进工作来节约粮食。辽宁省各地方国营酱油工厂正在实行酱油不加酱色或少加酱色的办法，一九五五年预计可给国家节约粮食八十万斤。国营天津酿酒厂职工把过去当作废料的酒糟试验代替粮食作曲酿酒，今年二月到三月的一个多月中，节约粮食六万多斤，这个厂在生产中全部采用这个办法后，预计全年可节约粮食一百二十万斤左右。
    栗再温说：但是，节约粮食的重要意义并不是每一个职工都已经完全了解了的，浪费粮食的现象依然是存在的。有些食堂积压粮食和保管不善致使粮食霉烂。在粮食加工、保管、运输和以粮食为原料的工业中，也有严重浪费粮食的现象。一九五四年全国铁路共发生粮食运送事故六千二百三十五件，占各种运送事故的第一位。市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法实施以后，对于推动职工群众节约粮食，减少或避免浪费，将会有很大的作用。工人阶级要坚决拥护市镇粮食定量供应办法，并成为执行这个办法的好榜样。要按照粮食供应的定量，很好地计划自己的家庭用粮，为国家节约更多的粮食，使国家能有必要的粮食储备。我们相信觉悟了的中国工人阶级一定能在这个工作中起模范作用。
