Zhan Shuijing, a technician at the Dalian Shipbuilding Company's Machinery Plant, has not produced a single piece of waste or reworked product in seven and a half years, and has consistently exceeded his monthly quota. This achievement eloquently answers an extremely important question: in industrial production, waste and non-conforming products are entirely avoidable and should be.

For the needs of all aspects of socialist construction, we must produce a large number of high-quality industrial products of all kinds. Producing waste and non-conforming products neither increases industrial output nor avoids wasting a lot of manpower and materials. This is a scourge in industrial production. Although the reasoning is so clear, the phenomenon of low product quality and abundant waste in some existing enterprises continues year after year without improvement. Many people even fabricate various excuses to cover up this phenomenon. These people should think about what Comrade Zhan Shuijing said.

Some people say: "Slow work yields fine work; to ensure quality will reduce output and will not improve labor productivity." Is this really the case? Let's look at Zhan Shuijing's answer: "Being careful and prudent means not acting recklessly, but it does not mean being timid and afraid to give full play to initiative and creativity. By accurately grasping the rules while ensuring quality, we can steadily increase output." He cited an example of manufacturing a product: the first task took him thirty-nine work hours, and later he gradually increased the speed of the machine tool, eventually taking only twenty-one work hours. In the first half of this year, he completed his work quota two months ahead of schedule. This shows that improving quality does not affect output.

Some people say: "A craftsman must sharpen his tools to do his work well." To ensure product quality, you need new equipment, but there are still many old machines in existing enterprises. Isn't it a difficult problem to prevent them from producing waste products? To refute these people, let's also look at Zhan Shuijing's answer: "For more than seven years, I have only used Soviet machine tools for three months. The rest of the time I used two old belt-driven lathes that are older than me. The tolerance for the work I do cannot exceed three threads, but I strictly guarantee the quality." Moreover, in existing enterprises, there are also many of the latest machine tools, but they still produce waste products, which makes it even clearer that the key is not the machine tool.

Some people also say: workers only know how to cut according to the drawings. If the drawings are wrong, the workers cannot be held responsible. Yes, there is some truth to this statement; but what about the other half of the truth? Please see Zhan Shuijing's answer again: "Although I am not responsible if the drawings are wrong, poor product quality is the greatest waste." Since workers are the masters of the enterprise, how can they tolerate this "greatest waste"? Don't they have a responsibility to inspect and supervise the work of the design and drafting departments? It is precisely because he does not relax his research and inspection of every drawing that Zhan Shuijing has avoided many accidents that almost led to the production of waste products.

So, does Zhan Shuijing have any secrets to not producing waste products for seven and a half years and consistently exceeding his monthly quota? He has no secrets; but he has valuable experience: first, unite everyone to wholeheartedly do a good job in production, and do not be distracted by any personal matters. Second, abide by labor discipline and honestly follow operating procedures: carefully study the drawings before production, carefully grasp the rules during production, and conduct inspections meticulously after completing each task. Third, humbly learn technology, especially actively implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, and continuously improve one's technical level.

Zhan Shuijing's achievements are very significant and prominent, and Zhan Shuijing's experience is very important and has universal value for promotion. It is hoped that all employees in industrial production enterprises and departments will learn from Zhan Shuijing and follow his example!

    詹水晶回答了什么
    孔桑
    大连造船公司机械厂技工詹水晶，七年半没有出过一件废品和返修活，月月超额完成任务，这个事迹雄辩地回答了一个极其重要的问题：在工业生产中，废品和不合规格的产品，是十分应该也完全可能避免的。
    为了社会主义建设事业各方面的需要，我们必须生产数量众多和品质优良的各种工业产品，而生产废品和不合规格的产品，既不能增加工业产量，还要浪费许多人力物力，这是工业生产中的祸患。虽然道理是这样的明明白白，可是现有的某些企业中，产品质量低劣、废品众多的现象仍然年复一年地继续下去，不见好转，有不少的人还制造了各种借口来掩饰这种现象。这些人，应当思考思考詹水晶同志说的话。
    有些人说：慢工出细活，要保证质量就会减少产量，就不能提高劳动生产率。真的是这样吗？请看詹水晶的回答吧：“小心谨慎是不要蛮干，但不是束手束脚不敢发挥积极性创造性。在保证质量的基础上摸准了规律，就可以稳稳当当地提高产量。”他举了制造一件产品的例子，第一个活他用了三十九个工，以后逐渐加快机床的转速，最后只用二十一个工，今年上半年他的工时定额，提前两个月就完成了。可见提高质量并不会影响产量。
    有些人说：“工欲善其事，必先利其器”，要保证产品质量就得有新的设备，而现有企业中还有不少旧机器，要它们不出废品，不是一个难题吗？要驳倒这些人，也请看詹水晶的回答吧：“七年多以来，我只使过三个月的苏联机床，其余的时间使的是两台比我年龄还大的旧皮带床子。我干的活，公差不能超过三道，但是我都严格地保证了质量。”再说，在现有企业中，也还有很多最新式的机床，可是仍然有出废品的，这就更加可见关键不在机床了。
    还有些人说：工人干活只知照图下料，图纸错了，干活的人可不能负责。是的，这话是有一半道理的；可是，还有一半道理呢？请再看詹水晶的回答：“图纸错了虽然不由我负责，可是产品质量低劣却是最大的浪费。”既然工人是企业的主人，难道能容忍这“最大的浪费”吗？难道没有责任去检查、监督设计和绘图部门的工作吗？正是由于不放松对每一张图纸的研究和检查，詹水晶才避免了很多险些生产废品的事故。
    那末，詹水晶七年半没有出废品，月月超额完成任务，究竟有没有秘诀呢？他没有什么秘诀；他却有宝贵的经验：首先就是团结大家全心全意地搞好生产，个人的任何事务都不分心。其次就是遵守劳动纪律老老实实按操作规程办事：生产前仔细研究图纸，生产中精心摸准规律，作完每一件活后都丝毫不苟地进行检查。再次就是虚心学习技术，特别是积极贯彻苏联专家的建议，不断提高自己的技术水平。
    詹水晶的成就是很显著的也是很突出的，詹水晶的经验是很重要的也是有普遍推广价值的。希望一切工业生产企业部门的职工，向詹水晶学习，向他看齐！
