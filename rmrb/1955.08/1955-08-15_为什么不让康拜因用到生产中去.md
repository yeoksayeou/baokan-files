To the Editor:

People remember that in the film "Donbass Miners," the old miner Nedo Lian once said: the coal cutter added twenty years to his life, and now the combine will add another ten years. However, in the Zibo Mining Bureau, this combine – the Donbass combined coal cutter – which can increase productivity and reduce the labor intensity of miners, has met a tragic fate.

In December 1953, a combine arrived at the Zibo Mining Bureau. People were very excited when they heard the news! Who knew that this combine rested for three months and was not transported to the Sanli Well of the Heishan Coal Mine until March 1954. Not long after it was used, the East China Coal Mining Administration notified in June that it should be transferred to the Jiawang Mining Bureau. However, after being packed, the combine was left at Heishan Station, exposed to the wind and rain, and showed signs of rust. In October, after the Soviet expert put forward their opinion, the combine was transported to Kuishan Coal Mine, but it was not officially used until May of this year.

In November 1954, another combine arrived at the Zibo Mining Bureau. This combine was placed in the warehouse as soon as it got off the train, and it was not sent to Shuangshan Coal Mine until April of this year. But more than a month later, it was transferred to Hongshan Coal Mine. The workers of Hongshan Coal Mine spent nearly half a month overhauling it and were preparing to transport it into the pit when the Zibo Mining Bureau suddenly notified them to "stop going down the pit," because the East China Coal Mining Administration wanted to transfer it again. But until now, the combine has not been transported away, but has been idle.

In addition, a Polish-style tunneling coal cutter, after being transported to the Zibo Mining Bureau in January 1954, although the use effect was good, has spent most of its time in "round-trip transfers" or "idle rest" for more than a year.

Machines can't speak, but people want to ask: Why not put these advanced machines into use, so that coal mine production can be gradually mechanized, and more coal can be produced to supply the needs of national construction and people's lives? The East China Coal Mining Administration and the Zibo Mining Bureau should investigate this issue.

### 为什么不让康拜因用到生产中去

    为什么不让康拜因用到生产中去编辑同志：
    人们记得，在“顿巴斯矿工”这部影片里，老矿工聂道连曾经说过：截煤机给他增加了二十年的寿命，今后康拜因又将要给他增加十年的寿命。但是，在淄博矿务局，这种能够提高生产率和减轻矿工劳动强度的康拜因——顿巴斯联合截煤机却遭到了悲惨的命运。
    一九五三年十二月，一台康拜因运到了淄博矿务局。人们听到这个消息，都十分兴奋！谁知道，这台康拜因休息了三个月，到一九五四年三月才被运到黑山煤矿三立井。使用不久，华东煤矿管理局又在六月份通知要将它调到贾汪矿务局。但是，康拜因在装箱后却一直在黑山车站放着，经风吹雨淋，已经有生锈现象。到十月份，经苏联专家提出意见，康拜因被运到奎山煤矿，但是直到今年五月才被正式使用。
    一九五四年十一月，另一台康拜因又到了淄博矿务局。这台康拜因一下火车就被放在仓库里，到今年四月才被送到双山煤矿。但是一个多月以后，它又被调到洪山煤矿。洪山煤矿的工人费了近半个月的时间进行了大修，正准备运入坑井，突然淄博矿务局通知“停止下井”，原因是华东煤矿管理局又要把它调走了。但直到现在，康拜因并没有被运走，却一直闲置着。
    另外，有一台波兰式的掘进割煤机，在一九五四年一月运到淄博矿务局后，虽然使用效果良好，但一年多以来大部分时间都是过着“往返调运”或“闲置休息”的生活。
    机械不会说话，但是人们要提出责问：为什么不让这些先进的机械运用起来，使煤矿生产逐步机械化，生产更多的煤来供给国家建设和人民生活的需要呢？华东煤矿管理局和淄博矿务局应该对这个问题进行检查。王道钰
