Hebei Province is building eleven new agricultural machinery stations before the autumn plowing season to promote increased grain and cotton production and the socialist transformation of agriculture. At the same time, it is expanding the fourteen agricultural machinery stations already established. The sites of the new stations will be selected in the concentrated cotton-growing areas of Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, Cangxian, Baoding, and Tianjin prefectures, as well as in the immigration areas of Zhangjiakou Prefecture, and in areas with a good foundation of mutual aid and cooperation, convenient transportation, and a shortage of labor and animal power. These new stations will be equipped with 1,580 horsepower of tractors and plan to cultivate 89,500 mu of land for farmers this autumn. After the expansion of the original fourteen tractor stations, the horsepower of the tractors will increase from 1,882 to 4,742; the service area will also be expanded from the originally planned 250,000 mu to more than 380,000 mu. After the establishment of the new stations and the expansion of the old stations, a total of more than 470,000 mu of land will be cultivated for farmers this autumn.

At present, the tractors and farm implements allocated to Hebei Province by the Ministry of Agriculture have been transported to various places. The 500 mechanics trained by the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry for the new and expanded stations will soon complete their training. Staff members have been dispatched to various places to work with local leading organs to select the sites for the new stations, select the administrative staff for the new stations, and prepare for the construction of the stations. The staff of the tractor stations that are being expanded are actively conducting propaganda among the farmers to expand the stations, consulting with agricultural producers' cooperatives in nearby villages on the issue of substitute cultivation, helping the cooperatives plan and survey land, and actively expanding the service area.

　　河北省新建一批农业机器站
    河北省为了促进粮棉增产和农业的社会主义改造，在今年秋耕前将再建十一个农业机器站，同时扩建已建立的十四个农业机器站。新建站的站址，将选择在邯郸、邢台、石家庄、沧县、保定、天津等专区的集中棉区和张家口专区的移民区以及互助合作基础较好、交通方便、劳力畜力较缺乏的地方。这些新建站将配备一千五百八十马力的拖拉机，计划今秋给农民代耕八万九千五百亩地。原有的十四个拖拉机站扩建后，拖拉机的马力由一千八百八十二增加到四千七百四十二；服务面积也将由原计划的二十五万亩扩大到三十八万多亩。新站建立和旧站扩建后，今秋将共给农民代耕地四十七万多亩。
    现在，农业部增配给河北省的拖拉机和农具，已经运到各地。省农林厅为新建和扩建各站训练的五百名机务人员，即将训练完毕；并已派出工作人员到各地结合当地领导机关选择新建站的地址，挑选新站的行政管理人员，进行建站的筹备。正在扩建的各拖拉机站的职工们，正积极向农民进行扩站的宣传，和附近各村农业生产合作社协商代耕问题，帮助各社规划和勘测土地，积极扩大服务面积。
