Ways to Save Steel
　　By Our Reporter Jin Yukun
    The Harbin Ball Bearing Factory is supplying China's machine manufacturing industry with hundreds of specifications of precision products.
    Every modern machine, including automobiles, airplanes, various machine tools, and engines, requires ball bearings. Manufacturing ball bearings requires high-quality steel. High-quality steel is more than twice as expensive as ordinary steel. Material costs at ball bearing factories account for more than 70% of the product cost. Therefore, how to rationally use high-quality steel is a major issue in the ball bearing factory's efforts to practice thrift.
    In the past, the leading staff of the Harbin Ball Bearing Factory were content with completing production and profit plans, and paid little attention to saving raw materials and reducing product costs, resulting in a monthly increase in raw material consumption rates and defective product rates. The average steel utilization rate of this factory in 1953 was less than 30%. This means that about 70% of the large amount of steel purchased each year was not made into ball bearings, but turned into chips and waste. Taking the retainer, which had the lowest metal utilization rate, as an example, if 100 kilograms of steel were processed into finished products, its weight would only be 12 kilograms.
    At the beginning of last year, the leading staff of the Harbin Ball Bearing Factory paid attention to the work of saving metal. This began after the state put forward more stringent requirements for them to reduce costs and save raw materials. At that time, the workers put forward the slogan: "A thousand catties of grain under the cutting tool." This sentence illustrates, on the one hand, that the potential for saving metal in the machine manufacturing industry is great, and on the other hand, that saving requires focusing on the cutting tool. To focus on the cutting tool, a series of reforms must be carried out in the process methods. The Harbin Ball Bearing Factory is carrying out this work in three aspects:
    The first is to research and improve cutting tools to reduce the amount of steel chips. For example, the Zhang Wanren group in the lathe workshop, their task is to cut steel bars into several sections. Because the cutting tool used in the past was too wide and the cutting distance was too large, steel that could have been made into finished products was turned into chips. According to the advanced Soviet experience, the Zhang Wanren group proposed reducing the tool width by 0.5 mm. The factory leaders supported their suggestion and organized technicians to help them experiment. The result proved that not only was the consumption of raw materials reduced, but also fewer defective products were produced. Originally, the same amount of steel could cut ten pieces, but now it can cut eleven. This group can save the state about 6,000 yuan worth of steel every month.
    The second method is to reduce the machining allowance of steel. In the past, due to technical conservatism, the machining allowance of steel was too large. For example, for products with a specification of 100 mm, an actual allowance of 3 mm is sufficient, but the general allowance is more than 5 mm, and some machining allowances are even more than 40% larger than the product. This greatly wasted steel, increased cutting time by more than one-third, and also wasted a lot of manpower and electricity. After research, the machining allowance of existing steel materials was reduced by 1 to 2 mm, and the machining allowance of steel balls was also reduced by 0.2 mm. In this way, it is estimated that 73 tons of steel can be saved for the country this year, and the metal utilization rate can be increased by about 8%.
    The third method is to improve process methods and make extensive use of residual materials (core material, head material). The so-called "waste" cut off during the processing process contains more than 50% of reusable residual materials. For example, the bearings manufactured from steel bars only occupy the outer ring of the steel bar, and a large part of the core material in the middle is cut out. These core materials could have been used to manufacture smaller bearings, but in the past, they were treated as waste. After research and experimentation, it was proved that the core material can be used after forging, which is not only possible, but also guarantees the quality for the manufacture of general bearings. From the beginning of last year to May of this year, they have saved the country 216 tons of steel by using the core material, and the steel utilization rate has increased from 28% to 33%, which is 19% higher than before the core material was used. In the steel ball workshop, due to the improvement of the blanking method for processing retainers, the nesting blanking has been increased from one time to continuous nesting blanking four times, and the steel utilization rate has increased from 13% to about 40%. In the past year, more than 50 tons of steel were saved for the country due to the improvement of the nesting blanking method and the use of waste balls.
    Currently, the Harbin Ball Bearing Factory is learning from advanced Soviet experience and plans to adopt the method of die-forging bearing races to minimize steel chips. It is estimated that after adopting this method, the steel utilization rate can be increased from 28% to about 44%.
    To do a good job in saving metal, not only technical measures are needed, but also organizational work is needed. The responsibility of the leadership lies in how to organize the various relevant departments and sections to work together to save steel. The first thing that should be done is how to guide the saving work and control the consumption of steel through planning work. The planning staff of the Harbin Ball Bearing Factory have played an active and creative role in this regard. They can timely modify the material consumption plan indicators according to actual investigations, so that the plan indicators can truly urge employees to make unremitting efforts to find various possibilities for saving raw materials. For example, the tool workshop needs 535 tons of steel, but after the planning staff conducted in-depth investigations in the workshop, they found that only more than 100 tons of steel were actually needed, so they persuaded the workshop leaders to reduce the indicator number by two-thirds. In the investigation, they also changed the excessive safety factor for blanking. The material consumption indicators after the investigation and modification were 5.3% lower than the actual consumption number in 1953. At the same time, they also took the initiative to point out the direction for saving steel from the monthly cost analysis. For example, last April, they found more than 120 tons of ball bearing steel core material and many waste steel balls in stock. They provided them to the factory leaders and instructed the warehouse to select, classify, and register the residual materials. The supply and marketing department filled in the material requisition limit form, and the production department incorporated the residual materials into the material input plan. The tool workshop alone saved more than 70,000 yuan by using this batch of residual materials.
    The material supply department should supervise the use of steel and create conditions for the utilization of residual materials. In order to change the past situation of lax control of material supply and one-sided emphasis on ensuring supply without asking about savings, the supply and marketing department of the Harbin Ball Bearing Factory implemented a material requisition limit system. The workshop material clerks also often took the initiative to help the workshop and the factory find various ways to save raw materials. In terms of utilizing residual materials, in addition to establishing waste recycling bins in each workshop and carrying out mass waste recycling work, the supply department also organizes full-time personnel to carry out waste recycling in the entire factory every month, classifies and registers the selected usable waste and sends it to the warehouse for safekeeping, and notifies the production department of the quantity and specifications of the usable residual materials so that they can be incorporated into the material input plan. From the beginning of last year to May of this year, the supply and marketing department has recovered a total of 2,250 tons of waste. In order to make it convenient for the workshop to use residual materials, the supply and marketing department also organized the processing of residual materials. Some head materials were forged into various specifications outside the factory according to needs, and some were rust-removed. In this way, the workshop employees were very willing to use residual materials.
    Due to the large amount of steel saved, the cost index of the Harbin Ball Bearing Factory in the fourth quarter of last year decreased by 24% compared with 1953, and the funds saved for the whole year amounted to more than 1.3 million yuan. From the beginning of last year to May of this year, according to preliminary calculations, 330 tons of several major steel materials have been saved. If the Harbin Ball Bearing Factory can continue to make unremitting efforts to further improve the steel utilization rate, we believe that it will save more steel for the country.

　　节约钢材的途径
　　本报记者　金雨困
    哈尔滨滚珠轴承厂正以数百种规格的精密产品供应我国机器制造业的需要。
    无论哪一种现代化的机器，包括汽车、飞机、各式机床和发动机等，都需要滚珠轴承。制造滚珠轴承需要优质钢。优质钢的价格较普通钢贵一倍以上。滚珠轴承厂的材料费用要占产品成本的百分之七十以上。因此，如何合理地使用优质钢是滚珠轴承厂厉行节约当中的一个重大问题。
    过去，哈尔滨滚珠轴承厂的领导工作人员只满足于完成产量和利润计划，很少注意节约原材料、降低产品成本，以致原材料消耗率和废品率逐月上升。这个工厂一九五三年的钢材平均利用率还不到百分之三十。这就是说，每年购进的大量钢材，有百分之七十左右不是制成滚珠轴承，而是变成了切屑和废料。以金属利用率最低的一种保持器为例，如果用一百公斤的钢材加工成成品，它的体重就只剩下十二公斤了。
    去年年初，哈尔滨滚珠轴承厂领导工作人员注意了节约金属的工作。这是在国家向他们提出了更严格地降低成本、节约原材料的要求以后开始的。当时，职工们提出了这样一句口号：“车刀下边千斤粮”。这句话一方面说明了在机器制造工业中节约金属的潜力很大，另方面说明要节约需要从车刀下边打主意。而要从车刀下边打主意，就必须在工艺方法上进行一系列的改革。哈尔滨滚珠轴承厂从三方面来进行这个工作：
    首先是研究改进刀具，减少钢材的切屑部分。例如车工车间的张万仁小组，他们的任务是把钢棒切成若干段。由于过去用的切削刀太宽，切削的距离太大，把本来可以制成成品的钢材也变成切屑了。张万仁小组根据苏联的先进经验，提出将刀宽减少零点五公厘，厂的领导上支持了他们的建议，并组织技术人员帮助他们试验，结果证明不但减少了原材料消耗，而且少出了废品。原来同样数量的钢材能切十个，现在可切十一个。这个小组每月就可为国家节约价值六千元左右的钢材。
    第二个办法是减少钢材的加工留量。过去由于技术上保守，钢材的加工留量过大。如一百公厘规格的产品，实际留量有三公厘就可以，但一般留量都在五公厘以上，甚至有的加工留量竟比产品大百分之四十以上。这样就大大地浪费了钢材，并使切削的时间增加三分之一以上，还浪费了许多人力和电力。经过研究，将现有的钢材的加工留量减少一至二公厘，将钢球的加工留量也减少了零点二公厘。这样，预计今年就可为国家节约钢材七十三吨，并使金属利用率提高百分之八左右。
    第三个办法是改进工艺方法，大量利用残料
  （料心、料头）。在加工过程中切削下来的所谓“废料”，其中有百分之五十以上是可以利用的残料。如用钢棒加工制造的轴承所占用的只是钢棒的外圈，中间很大部分的料心都被切削出来，这些料心本来可供制造较小的轴承用，但过去都作为废料处理了。经过研究试验，证明料心经过锻加工后加以利用，不仅可能，而且供应制造一般轴承也能够保证质量。从去年年初到今年五月为止，他们利用料心为国家节约的钢材已有二百一十六吨，钢材利用率由百分之二十八提高到百分之三十三，较未利用料心前提高百分之十九。在钢球车间，由于改进了加工保持器的裁料方法，由套裁一次提高到连续套裁四次，钢材利用率由百分之十三提高到百分之四十左右。去年一年中就因改进套裁方法和利用废球为国家节约了五十多吨钢材。
    目前，哈尔滨滚珠轴承厂正在学习苏联先进经验，计划采用模锻轴承套的方法来把钢材切屑降低到最低限度。预计采用这一方法后，可使钢材利用率由百分之二十八提高到百分之四十四左右。
    要做好节约金属的工作，不仅要有技术措施，还需要做组织工作。领导的责任就在于如何把各个有关部门和科室组织起来，一致为节约钢材而工作。首先应该做好的是如何通过计划工作来指导节约工作和控制钢材的消耗量。哈尔滨滚珠轴承厂的计划工作人员在这方面发挥了主动性和创造性。他们能够及时地根据实际调查修改材料消耗计划指标，使计划指标真正能够督促职工为寻找节约原材料的种种可能而作不懈的努力。如工具车间需要钢材五百三十五吨，经计划工作人员深入车间进行调查，发现实际只需要钢材一百多吨，就说服车间领导工作人员将指标数削减了三分之二。他们在调查中，又改变了过大的下料保险系数。根据调查修改后的材料消耗指标，比一九五三年的实际消耗数降低了百分之五点三。他们同时又从每月的成本分析中主动地为节约钢材指出方向。如去年四月发现库存一百二十多吨滚珠钢料心和许多废钢球，他们就提供给厂领导上，责成仓库把残料进行选择分类登记，供销科填入限额领料单，生产科把残料编入投料计划中，仅工具车间利用了这批残料就节约了七万多元。
    材料供应部门应该监督钢材的使用，并为残料的利用创造条件。哈尔滨滚珠轴承厂的供销科，为了改变过去材料供应控制不严、片面地强调保证供应不问节约的情况，推行了限额领料制度。车间材料员还经常主动去帮助车间和工厂寻找节约原材料的各种办法。在利用残料方面，供应科除了在各车间建立废料回收箱、开展群众性的废料回收工作外，并有计划地每月组织专人在全厂进行废料回收，将挑选出来的可以利用的废料分类登记送入仓库保管，并将可利用的残料数量规格通知生产科，以便编入投料计划。自去年年初到今年五月，供销科共回收二千二百五十吨废料。为了使车间使用残料时方便，供销科还组织了残料的加工工作，有的料头根据需要到厂外锻成各种规格，有的进行去锈工作。这样，使得车间职工都很愿意使用残料。
    哈尔滨滚珠轴承厂由于大量节约了钢材，去年第四季度的成本指标较一九五三年下降百分之二十四，全年节约的资金达一百三十多万元。从去年年初到今年五月为止，据初步计算，几种主要钢材已节约了三百三十吨。哈尔滨滚珠轴承厂如果能够为进一步提高钢材利用率继续作不懈的努力，我们相信它还会为国家节约更多的钢材。
