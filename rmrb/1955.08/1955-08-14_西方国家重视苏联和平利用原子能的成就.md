Xinhua News Agency, August 13th dispatch: According to TASS reports: News from Geneva published in Dutch, Danish and Swedish newspapers indicates that Western scientists are paying close attention to the reports of Soviet scientists at the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy.

    The Geneva correspondent for the Dutch newspaper "Het Vrije Volk" reported: "The Russians have gone very far! After Western scientists studied the exhibition of reactor models and read the Russian materials, they openly admitted this." "American and British scientists admitted that they had learned a lot from the Russians."

    A Geneva dispatch in the Danish "Berlingske Aftenavis" said that the report by Academician Kursanov of the Soviet Union on the peaceful use of atomic energy in agriculture on the 11th attracted great attention, because the report showed that the Soviet Union may have surpassed other countries in the use of radioactive isotopes in agriculture.

    A Geneva dispatch in the Swedish "Dagens Nyheter" said that Professor Gustafsson, the Swedish representative attending the conference, believed that the discovery of Soviet scientists in the use of isotopes in the cultivation of sugar beets was sensational.

    "Svenska Dagbladet" said, "The Soviet representatives greatly surprised their Western counterparts. The Soviet representatives reported a large amount of information, which until now was considered highly secret, about atomic fission tests."

    A message from the Swedish News Agency said that in Geneva, "the atmosphere between the representatives of the East and the West is full of frankness and sincerity, an atmosphere that has not been seen since the end of World War II."

    西方国家重视苏联和平利用原子能的成就
    新华社十三日讯　据塔斯社消息：荷兰、丹麦和瑞典报纸上刊载的日内瓦消息表明，西方国家科学家十分注意苏联科学家在和平利用原子能国际会议上的报告。
    荷兰“自由人民报”驻日内瓦记者报道：“俄国人已经走得很远了！当西方科学家研究了俄国的有反应堆模型的展览会和看了俄国的材料后，他们公开地这样承认。”“美国和英国科学家承认，他们已经从俄国人那里学到了很多东西。”
    丹麦“贝林晚报”的日内瓦消息说，苏联库尔萨诺夫院士十一日就农业方面和平利用原子能问题所作的报告，引起了很大的注意，因为这一报告说明，苏联在农业方面利用放射性同位素可能已超过了其他国家。
    瑞典“斯德哥尔摩新闻”的日内瓦消息说，出席会议的瑞典代表古斯塔夫逊教授认为，苏联科学家在培植甜菜方面利用同位素的发现是轰动一时的。
    “瑞典日报”说，“苏联代表使他们的西方同行大为吃惊，苏联代表报告了大量的、至今被认为是非常秘密的关于原子核分裂试验的情况。”
    瑞典通讯社的消息说，在日内瓦，“东方和西方的代表之间充满着这样坦率、恳切的气氛，这种气氛是自从第二次世界大战结束以来所未曾有过的。”
