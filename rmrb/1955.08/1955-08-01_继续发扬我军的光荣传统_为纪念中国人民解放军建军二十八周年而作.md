    Continue to Carry Forward the Glorious Traditions of Our Army
    — In Commemoration of the Twenty-Eighth Anniversary of the Founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    Luo Ronghuan, Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

    This year’s “August 1st” marks the twenty-eighth anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Twenty-eight years ago today, the Chinese Communist Party led the armed uprising in Nanchang, and from that moment on, the Chinese people began to have a truly people's army. Over the decades, the People's Liberation Army has grown from small to large, from weak to strong, and has finally grown into an invincible force. It was by relying on this army that the Chinese people overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, and established the People's Republic of China, thereby establishing our country's position in Asia and the world. The history of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle is inseparable from the heroic struggle of the People's Liberation Army. Therefore, on this festival, it is natural for the people and the troops to educate themselves with the history of our army's long-term arduous struggle.
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army has been fighting under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong since its founding. Comrade Mao Zedong is the creator and organizer of our army. In leading the Chinese revolutionary war, Comrade Mao Zedong made creative contributions to our army's principles of army building, strategies and tactics, political work, leadership style, etc., based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and the experience of Soviet army building. This is the fundamental guarantee for our army to achieve victory and the valuable property of the Chinese people and their army. Our army must continue to carry forward these glorious traditions in future construction and combat.
    After the founding of the People's Republic of China, our army entered a new stage of modernization and shouldered the new task of defending the motherland and defending against imperialist aggression. This task is of greater significance than the heroic struggles we have waged in the past. Our army must be further improved and must successfully complete all tasks in modernization. If not, our army will not be able to move forward, will not be able to defeat imperialist aggression, and our country's socialist construction will not have a reliable guarantee.
    Modernization first requires equipping our army with the latest weapons, and military training needs to meet the requirements of modern warfare. The political awareness of the troops must be further improved. At the same time, all aspects of the army must be further regularized. That is to say, the troops are required to have a higher degree of centralization and unity, higher organizational and disciplinary qualities, and must be highly unified in terms of equipment, organization, training, systems, discipline, etc. The entire army must implement regulations and have more rigorous disciplinary training. In the process of modernization and regularization, our army must also implement many major system reforms, such as the implementation of compulsory military service, military ranks, and a salary system. In these aspects, we have done a great deal of work in the past few years and have achieved great results. Our army's modernization and regularization have taken a big step forward.
    Regarding the guiding principle of our army's modernization, Chairman Mao has pointed out: The modern army we want to build is an excellent modern revolutionary army. Modernization and regularization should not weaken our army's glorious traditions, but rather carry them forward. Therefore, it is incorrect for our army to break away from history and think that everything in the past is undesirable when continuing to move forward. For example, the Party's leadership over the army, our army's purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly, and the resulting principles of unity between the army and the people, and unity between officers and soldiers; the style of linking with reality, linking with the masses, and criticism and self-criticism, must not only not be weakened but must also be strengthened in modernization. Because these are the embodiment of the essence of our people's army and the source of our army's combat effectiveness. The reason why our army can overcome powerful enemies ten times or a hundred times stronger than itself in unimaginable difficulties is inseparable from these glorious traditions. In fact, the changes in our army's equipment, the reform of some systems, further regularization measures, etc., cannot and should never violate our army's principles of army building. Our army's principles of army building cannot be changed today, nor can they be changed in the future. Our army's glorious traditions must be carried forward today, and must be carried forward in the future.
    As early as 1936, Comrade Mao Zedong said in "Strategic Issues in China's Revolutionary War": "Guerrillaism has two aspects. On the one hand, it is irregularity, that is, non-concentration, non-unity, lax discipline, and simplification of work methods. These things were brought by the Red Army itself in its infancy, and some of them were precisely needed at that time. However, when the Red Army reaches the advanced stage, it must gradually and consciously remove them, so that the Red Army is more concentrated, more unified, more disciplined, and the work is more meticulous, that is, to make it more regular. In combat command, the guerrilla nature that is unnecessary in the advanced stage should also be gradually and consciously reduced. Refusing to move forward in this aspect, stubbornly stagnating in the old stage, is not allowed, is harmful, and is not conducive to large-scale operations." Our army is now in a new stage of modernization and regularization, which is also the advanced stage of our army's construction. Therefore, any complacency and refusal to move forward will hinder our army's modernization and regularization, and is very wrong. But on the other hand, we must never sever history, disregard the actual situation of our country and our army, and especially should not break away from our army's glorious traditions to carry out modernization. Comrade Mao Zedong also pointed out in the above article the errors that may arise in this respect: "Refusing historical facts in this respect, opposing the retention of useful things, rashly breaking away from the current stage... is also not allowed, is harmful, and is not conducive to current operations." "We must sum up all the excellent things of the past and turn them into a systematic, more developed, and richer military line in order to strive to defeat the enemy today and prepare to transition to a new stage in the future." These teachings still have extremely important significance today.
    At present, the phenomenon of weakening our army's glorious traditions exists in the troops, and there is some growth, which is an extremely dangerous tendency. For example, some comrades put strict discipline and strict management in opposition to persuasion and education, and put the regularization of the army in opposition to necessary democracy, failing to understand the unity and consistency between the two, and mistakenly believing that: "If you want regularization, you cannot talk about democracy, and if you want to talk about democracy, you cannot have regularization." Therefore, they abuse their power, abuse punishments, and seriously damage our army's glorious tradition of unity between officers and soldiers, and unity between superiors and subordinates. These comrades have forgotten that discipline must be built on the basis of consciousness. Without the improvement of the consciousness of officers and soldiers, the consistency of ideological understanding, the exemplary role of cadres, etc., there can be no strict discipline. Some comrades, after the implementation of the Officer Service Regulations and the salary system for officers, saw that the difference in treatment between officers and soldiers was greater than in the past, and mistakenly believed that our army's tradition of unity between officers and soldiers was about to change; therefore, they no longer often stay with the soldiers, no longer care about the lives of the soldiers, do not ask about poor food, and do not care about the soldiers' illnesses and personal difficulties, which has gradually alienated the relationship between officers and soldiers. If this phenomenon is not corrected, there is a danger of damaging the internal unity of our army. These comrades do not understand that the implementation of the Officer Service Regulations and the salary system for officers is due to the professionalization of officers and the measures that officers should take to serve in the army for a long time, which is in line with the socialist principle of distribution according to work. If we can correctly understand this and implement it correctly, it will not weaken the tradition of unity between officers and soldiers. The Soviet army is a highly modernized and regularized army, with a high degree of organization and discipline, but this has not affected the relationship between officers and soldiers in the Soviet army. On the contrary, the relationship between officers and soldiers is very close, like brothers.
    Some comrades, because the troops have moved into barracks, the training tasks of the army are very heavy, and the tasks of the work team have been greatly reduced, mistakenly believe that the tradition of unity between the army and the people and supporting the government and cherishing the people is not important now. Therefore, their class feelings for the people began to weaken. When there are conditions to participate in local mass work, they do not actively participate; they occupy too much cultivated land for building barracks and training grounds, and unnecessarily mobilize the masses to move; they do not pay attention to protecting crops during field exercises; they do not strictly manage car drivers, and traffic accidents occur frequently; they violate policies in the work of unified purchase and sale; and they do not seriously study the Constitution and national laws. These comrades do not understand that it is the responsibility of every member of our people's army to always care about and support the lives and struggles of the working people. It is necessary to educate the troops to respect the government and oppose the idea of ​​"guns first". Soldiers should be educated to abide by national laws and all government regulations at all times and in all places in their daily lives, in the execution of tasks, and in public places. The leading organs should pay more attention to ensuring that all their orders and instructions to the troops are completely consistent with national laws and that there are no violations.
    Some comrades mistakenly believe that since modernization requires equipping the army with the latest weapons and transportation, our lives should also be at a high level. They build offices, dormitories, and clubs too luxuriously; they equip the office furniture too exquisitely; some officers do not pay attention to saving the salary they receive, so that their children and family members also live better than others, developing a style of extravagance, being divorced from the masses. This is very wrong and is completely incompatible with our army's tradition of hard work and simplicity. These comrades do not understand that the standard of living must be adapted to the level of production of the entire country, and the standard of living of the army cannot and should not be too different from the standard of living of the people across the country. The style of hard work and overcoming difficulties must be carried forward now, and must be carried forward in the future. If the army does not develop this style in peacetime, it will not be able to withstand the test of cruel war.
    Some comrades are currently developing a tendency to break away from politics. Paying attention to technology is correct. Disregarding politics is wrong. Some even openly say: "We only manage business, not ideology." In terms of employing people, they pay attention to cultural and technical level, regardless of political conditions, and do not regard purifying the internal affairs and consolidating the troops as a regular political task. Some officers even do not ask about political conditions when solving marriage problems and randomly find partners, giving counter-revolutionaries an opportunity to take advantage of. These comrades were once able to maintain constant political vigilance in the frequent combat environment, but they become paralyzed when open and large-scale wars stop. These comrades do not understand that modernization cannot absolutely ignore politics. On the contrary, to build a modern revolutionary army, we must greatly strengthen the Marxist-Leninist education of the troops and raise the political consciousness of the troops to a new level, that is, the socialist level. The army must not only be good at fighting against the enemy who openly carries guns, but also must be good at fighting against the hidden enemy. Only in this way can the entire army unite as one and the troops maintain a high degree of fighting will at all times, ready to deal with imperialist aggression and prevent sudden incidents.
    In recent years, some comrades have developed a style of sitting in the office and not going down to the company, being content with the life in the office, not going to the playground or classroom, spending too much time in meetings, writing documents, instructions, reports, plans, etc., forming serious bureaucracy and formalism, being arrogant and complacent, not carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and even suppressing criticism and retaliating against critics. These comrades do not understand that the style of linking with the masses, linking with reality, and criticism and self-criticism is the style of the Party and the style of our army's political work. Weakening it will inevitably lead to bureaucracy and formalism, making work not in-depth and forming generalized leadership. This is incompatible with our army's leadership style and must be corrected.
    So, what are the reasons for the above-mentioned weakening of glorious traditions? First of all, some of our comrades lack a clear analysis and distinction between which are the things that belong to our army's infancy and need to be removed when our army transitions to the advanced stage, and which are the principles of army building and glorious traditions that need to be continued to be carried forward. In recent years, our army has implemented many major system reforms and has continuously adopted many new measures. When these new systems and new measures are implemented, many new problems will inevitably arise objectively, and many misunderstandings will arise. Some of our leading organs have underestimated this and lack timely education and explanation. Therefore, some comrades either have a resistant attitude towards the new systems and new measures, or they deny everything in the past and think that our army's glorious traditions and principles of army building also need to be changed. In the past few years, we have carried out continuous struggles against the former tendency, that is, the tendency to stagnate, be complacent, and refuse to learn new things. There is no doubt that we must continue to fight against this tendency in the future. But we must also see that the latter tendency is growing. They do not understand that our army's principles of army building and glorious traditions are the product of the combination of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution, are the valuable experience gained through decades of bloody struggle by our army, and have been tested countless times. Practice has proven that with it, we can achieve victory, and without it, we will suffer defeat. These principles are completely suitable for China's situation and the characteristics of our army. It is impossible to imagine discarding these and coming up with another set. The modern army we want to build is not simply relying on excellent weapons and equipment, but more importantly on people with high political consciousness. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The foundation of the army lies in the soldiers. Without progressive political spirit infused into the army, without progressive political work to carry out this infusion, true unity between officers and soldiers cannot be achieved, and the enthusiasm of officers and soldiers for resisting war cannot be maximized. All technologies and tactics cannot get the best foundation to exert their due effect." The relationship between the army and the people is also the same: "The army must be integrated with the people, so that the army is seen as its own army in the eyes of the people, and this army will be invincible in the world." Therefore, we say that our army's glorious traditions are not only necessary in the past, but also necessary in modernization. If we deviate from these principles, betray these traditions, and if officers are separated from soldiers, it will damage the unity of the troops and weaken the combat effectiveness of the army. If the army is separated from the people and does not receive the support of the people, it will lose its spiritual support and block the source of combat power. Therefore, we should, according to the new situation, make our army's glorious traditions shine in the new environment. For example, the troops enter the barracks. Our army's work team's tasks have been reduced. Then, in this situation, we should study how to continue to carry forward the tradition of unity between the army and the people, rather than abolish it. Now the difference in living standards between officers and soldiers has increased. Then, in this situation, we should study how to better carry forward the tradition of unity between officers and soldiers, rather than weaken it. The problem is very obvious. The methods and approaches need to be changed, must be changed, but the principles of army building and glorious traditions must never be changed or weakened.
    The environment in which our army is now located is much more complex than the rural environment of the past. The troops are not only constantly eroded by bourgeois ideology, but some people are even influenced by counter-revolutionary ideas, and thus begin to degenerate and deteriorate. There are also many old soldiers in our army, many of whom have been reformed, but there are also many who have not yet been reformed. They bring the Kuomintang's methods of managing the army to our army. This very complex situation inside and outside our army cannot but have a profound impact on maintaining and carrying forward our army's glorious traditions. In addition, in recent years, our army has established various services and arms in a very short period of time and has promoted many grassroots cadres. These new cadres and new members do not have a deep experience of our army's glorious traditions, and our education for them is not enough. Therefore, deviations are likely to occur in the work. This situation will continue to exist for a considerable period of time in the future. This shows that it is of special significance for us to conduct constant and continuous education on our army's glorious traditions among the troops. Historical experience and lessons have also proved this point.
    In short, our army is now in a new stage of army building and is implementing a huge and historically significant transformation. This transformation is being carried out in the context of a very complex and acute class struggle in our country. Therefore, our emphasis on carrying forward our army's glorious traditions is not just old talk, but has its special practical significance. The erroneous understanding and distortion of glorious traditions in the troops must be thoroughly criticized and corrected. In recent years, the achievements of our army's modernization have been tremendous. We believe that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao Zedong, as long as our entire army unites as one and continues to work hard, we will surely be able to build our army into an excellent modern revolutionary army and complete the great and glorious task of defending the socialist construction of the motherland.

    继续发扬我军的光荣传统
    ——为纪念中国人民解放军建军二十八周年而作
    中国人民解放军总政治部主任　罗荣桓
    今年“八一”是中国人民解放军建军二十八周年纪念日。二十八年前的今天，中国共产党在南昌领导了武装起义，从此中国人民开始有了一支真正的人民军队。几十年来，人民解放军由小到大、由弱到强，终于生长壮大成为不可战胜的力量。中国人民就是依靠这支军队推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治，建立了中华人民共和国，从而确立了我国在亚洲和世界的地位。中国人民革命斗争的历史，是与人民解放军的英勇奋斗分不开的。因此，在这个节日，人民和部队常以我军长期艰苦奋斗的历史来教育自己，是很自然的事。
    中国人民解放军从建军之日起，就是在党和毛泽东同志领导下进行战斗的。毛泽东同志是我军的创造者和组织者。毛泽东同志根据马克思列宁主义的原则和苏联建军的经验，在领导中国革命战争中，对于我军的建军原则，战略战术，政治工作，领导作风等，都作了创造性的贡献。这是我军取得胜利的根本保证，是中国人民及其军队的宝贵财产。我军在今后的建设和作战中，必须继续发扬这些光荣传统。
    中华人民共和国成立后，我军进入了现代化建设的新阶段，担负起保卫祖国、防御帝国主义侵略的新任务。这个任务，比之我们过去所进行的英勇斗争，是具有更伟大的意义的。我军必须进一步提高，必须胜利完成现代化建设中的一切任务。不如此，我军就不能前进，就不能战胜帝国主义的侵略，我国社会主义建设就没有可靠的保障。
    现代化建设首先需要把我军用最新式的武器装备起来，军事训练需要适合现代化战争的要求。部队的政治觉悟，要有进一步的提高。同时，军队各个方面也必须进一步正规化。这就是说，要求部队有更高度的集中统一，有更高的组织性和纪律性，在装备、编制、训练、制度、纪律等各方面，必须是高度统一的。全军上下必须贯彻条令、有更严格的纪律训练。在现代化正规化建设中，我军还必须实行许多重大制度的改革，如实行义务兵役制、军衔制和薪金制等。在这些方面，几年来，我们进行了巨大的工作，取得了很大的成绩，我军现代化正规化建设是向前大大迈进了一步。
    关于我军现代化建设的方针，毛主席已经指出：我们要建设的现代化军队，是一支优良的现代化的革命军队。在现代化正规化建设中不是削弱我军的光荣传统，而是要发扬我军的光荣传统。所以目前我军在继续向前发展时，如果脱离历史，认为过去一切都要不得了，是不正确的。例如党对军队的领导，我军全心全意为人民服务的建军宗旨，和由此产生的军民一致，官兵一致的原则；联系实际，联系群众，批评和自我批评的作风等等，在现代化建设中，都不但不能削弱，而且还必须加强。因为这些是我人民军队本质的体现，是我军战斗力的泉源。我军之所以能在难以想像的困难中，战胜十倍百倍于自己的强大敌人，是与这些光荣传统分不开的。实际上，我军装备的改变，若干制度的改革，进一步正规化的措施等等，都是不能违背也绝不应违背我军的建军原则的。我军的建军原则，今天不能改变，将来也是不能改变的。我军的光荣传统，今天要发扬，将来也是要发扬的。
    早在一九三六年，毛泽东同志在“中国革命战争的战略问题”中就说过：“游击主义有两方面。一方面是非正规性，就是不集中、不统一、纪律不严、工作方法简单化等。这些东西是红军幼年时代本身带来的，有些在当时还正是需要的。然而到了红军的高级阶段，必须逐渐地自觉地去掉它们，使红军更集中些，更统一些，更有纪律些，工作更周密些，就是说使之更带正规性。在作战指挥上，也应逐渐地自觉地减少那些在高级阶段所不必要的游击性。在这一方面拒绝前进，固执地停顿于旧阶段，是不许可的，是有害的，是不利于大规模作战的。”我军现在正是处在现代化正规化建设的新阶段，也就是我军建设的高级阶段，因此，任何固步自封，拒绝前进，都会妨碍我军现代化正规化建设的，都是非常错误的。但另一方面，也绝不能割断历史，不照顾我国我军所处的实际情况，尤其不应脱离我军的光荣传统来进行现代化建设。毛泽东同志在上文中也同时指出过在这一方面可能产生的错误：“在这一方面拒绝历史事实，反对保留有用的东西，贸然地脱离现阶段，……同样是不许可的，是有害的，是不利于当前作战的。”“我们要把所有一切过去的优良的东西都总结起来，成为有系统的更发展的更丰富的军事路线，以便争取在今天战胜敌人，并且准备在将来转变到新阶段去。”这些教诲，在今天还是有着极其重大的意义的。
    目前部队中，削弱我军光荣传统的现象是存在的，并且有某些滋长，这是一个极端危险的倾向。例如有些同志把严格纪律、严格管理与说服教育对立起来，把军队正规化与必要的民主对立起来，不了解两者的统一性与一致性，错误地认为：“要正规化就不能讲民主，要讲民主就不能正规化。”因而滥用职权，滥施处罚，严重地损害了我军官兵一致、上下一致的光荣传统。这些同志们忘记了，纪律必须建筑在自觉的基础上。没有官兵觉悟的提高，思想认识的一致，干部的模范作用等，就不能有严格的纪律。有些同志在军官实行军官服役条例和薪金制后，看到军官和士兵的待遇差别比过去大，就错误地认为我军官兵一致的传统要改变；因此就不和士兵经常在一起，对战士的生活也不再关心，伙食不好也不过问，对战士的疾病、个人困难都不加关怀，致使官兵关系逐渐疏远。这种现象如不加以纠正，就有损害我军内部团结的危险。这些同志不了解，军官实行军官服役条例和薪金制，是由于军官专业化，军官要长期在军队服务所应当采取的措施，是合乎社会主义按劳取酬的原则的。我们对此如能正确地认识，并且正确地执行，是不会削弱官兵一致的传统的。苏联军队是高度现代化正规化的军队，是有高度的组织性纪律性的，但是这并没有影响苏军的官兵关系，相反的，他们官兵关系是十分亲密的，是如同兄弟手足一样的。
    有些同志因为部队进驻了营房，军队的训练任务十分紧张，工作队的任务是大大减少了，就错误地认为军民一致、拥政爱民的传统现在不重要了。因此就对人民群众的阶级感情开始淡薄起来。在有条件参加地方群众工作时，也不积极参加；修建营房、演习场，占用过多的耕地，不必要地动员群众搬家；进行野外演习，不注意爱护庄稼；对于汽车司机管理不严，经常发生肇祸事件；在统购统销工作中，违犯政策；对宪法和国家法令不认真学习等等现象都产生了。这些同志不了解，经常关心和支援劳动人民的生活和斗争，是我人民军队每一个成员应有的责任，必须教育部队尊重政府，反对枪杆子第一的思想，要教育军人在日常生活中，在执行任务时，在公共场所，都要随时随地遵守国家法令和政府的一切规定。领导机关，则更应注意，使自己对部队的一切命令指示，都与国家法令完全一致，不得有任何违犯。
    有些同志错误地认为：现代化建设既然要以最新式的武器和运输工具装备军队，那么我们的生活也要随之有很高的水平。他们把办公室、宿舍、俱乐部修建得过于富丽堂皇；把办公室的家具设备得过分讲究；有些军官对所得的薪金不注意节约，使自己的子弟家属在生活上也表现得比别人高一等，发展一种铺张奢华、脱离群众的作风，这是非常错误的，是完全与我军艰苦朴素的传统不相容的。这些同志不了解，生活水平是必须与整个国家生产水平相适应的，军队生活水平是不能也不应与全国人民生活水平过分悬殊的。艰苦奋斗、克服困难的作风，现在要发扬，将来也还要发扬。军队平时不养成这种作风，就不能经受残酷的战争考验。
    有些同志目前滋长着一种脱离政治的倾向。重视技术，这是对的。轻视政治，这是错误的。有的甚至公开说：“我们只管理业务，不管思想。”在用人方面，重视文化技术水平，不管政治条件，没有把纯洁内部、巩固部队看作是经常的政治任务。甚至有些军官在解决婚姻问题时，不问政治条件，乱找对象，给反革命分子以可乘之机。这些同志过去在频繁的战斗环境中，曾经能够保持经常的政治警惕性，但目前公开的、大规模的战争停止了，就麻痹起来。这些同志不了解，现代化建设绝对不能忽视政治。相反的，我们要建设现代化的革命军队，必须大大加强部队的马克思列宁主义教育，把部队的政治觉悟提高到新的水平，即社会主义水平。军队不单要善于同公开拿枪的敌人斗争，而且必须善于同暗藏的敌人斗争，只有这样才能使全军上下团结
  一致，使部队经常保持高度的战斗意志，随时准备应付帝国主义的侵略，防止突然事变。
    有些同志近几年发展了坐机关不下连队，安于机关生活，不到操场、课堂的作风，用过多时间开会，写文件、指示、报告、计划等，形成严重的官僚主义和文牍主义，骄傲自满，批评和自我批评不开展，甚至压制批评，对批评者实行打击报复。这些同志不了解联系群众，联系实际，批评和自我批评的作风是党的作风，也是我军政治工作的作风。削弱了它，就必然产生官僚主义，形式主义，使工作不深入，形成一般化的领导。这是与我军领导作风不相容的，必须加以纠正。
    那末，产生上述这些削弱光荣传统的原因何在呢？首先是在于我们有些同志对于我军过渡到高级阶段时，哪些是属于我军幼年时代的东西，须要去掉它；哪些是属于我军建军原则和光荣传统的，须要继续发扬它，缺乏明确、清楚的分析和辨别。几年来，我军实行了许多重大制度的改革，不断采取许多新措施。在这些新制度新措施实施时，在客观上必然会带来许多新的问题，会产生许多误解，我们有些领导机关对此估计不够，缺乏及时的教育和解释。因此，有的同志要不是对新制度新措施产生抵触情绪，就是否认过去一切，认为我军的光荣传统、建军原则也都要改变了。几年来，我们对于前一种倾向，也就是停滞不前、固步自封、拒绝学习新事物的倾向，曾进行过不断的斗争，今后我们还必须继续同这种倾向作斗争，这是毫无疑问的。但是我们也必须看到，后一种倾向正在滋长。他们不了解我军建军原则和光荣传统，是马克思列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合的产物，是经过我军几十年流血斗争所取得的宝贵经验，是经过了无数次考验的。实践证明：有了它就可以取得胜利，离开它就要遭到失败。这些原则是完全适合中国情况和我军特点的。绝不能设想，丢弃这些，而另来一套。我们所要建设的现代化军队，绝不是单纯依靠武器装备的优良，更重要的是依靠有高度政治觉悟的人。毛泽东同志说过：“军队的基础在士兵，没有进步的政治精神贯注于军队之中，没有进步的政治工作去执行这种贯注，就不能达到真正的官长和士兵的一致，就不能激发官兵最大限度的抗战热忱，一切技术和战术就不能得着最好的基础去发挥它们应有的效力。”军民关系也是一样：“军队须和民众打成一片，使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下。”所以我们说，我军的光荣传统不单在过去是必须的，而在现代化建设中更是必须的。如果我们脱离了这些原则，背弃了这些传统，军官如果与士兵分离，就会损害部队的团结，就会削弱军队的战斗力。军队如果同人民分离，得不到人民的拥护，就失去了精神上的支持，堵塞了战斗力量的源泉。因此，我们应当根据新的情况，使我军光荣传统在新环境下得到发扬光大。例如部队进入营房。我军工作队任务减少了，那末在这个情况下，就应当研究如何继续发扬军民一致的传统，而不是去取消它。现在官兵生活待遇差别增大，那末在这种情况下，就应当研究怎样更好地发扬官兵一致的传统，而不是去削弱它。问题是很明显的，方式、方法需要改变，必须改变，而建军原则和光荣传统是绝不能改变和削弱的。
    我军现在所处的环境，比过去的农村环境，是复杂得多了，部队不只是受资产阶级思想的不断浸蚀，甚至有些人还受到反革命思想的影响，因而开始蜕化变质。我军内部也还有不少旧军人，他们许多是经过了改造的，但也有不少尚未改造好，他们把国民党管理军队的方法带到我军中来。我军外部内部这种非常复杂的情况，对保持和发扬我军光荣传统，是不能不有深刻影响的。再加上近几年来，我军在很短的时间内，建立了各军种兵种，提拔了不少的基层干部，这些新干部新成员，对我军的光荣传统还体验得不深，我们对他们的教育也还不够，因此在工作中就很容易发生偏向。这种情况，今后在相当一个时期内还会存在的。这就说明了我们对部队经常不断地进行有关我军光荣传统的教育是有特殊的意义的。历史的经验教训也证明了这一点。
    总之，我军现在正处在建军的新阶段，正在实施巨大的有历史意义的转变，这个转变又是在我国阶级斗争非常复杂尖锐的情况下进行的。因此，我们着重提出发扬我军光荣传统，并不是老生常谈，而是有其特殊的现实意义。部队中对光荣传统的错误认识和曲解必须加以彻底的批判和纠正。几年来，我军现代化建设的成绩是巨大的，我们相信，在党中央和毛泽东主席的领导下，只要我们全军上下团结一致，继续努力，我们就一定能够把我军建设成为一支优良的现代化的革命军队，完成保卫祖国社会主义建设的伟大光荣的任务。
