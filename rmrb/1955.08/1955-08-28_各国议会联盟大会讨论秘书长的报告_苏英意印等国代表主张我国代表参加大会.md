Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, August 27th: The 44th Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union continued its discussion of the Secretary-General's report on August 26th, according to TASS.

　　The first speaker was Soviet representative Mikhailov, who said that Soviet parliamentarians participated in the Inter-Parliamentary Union guided by the declaration unanimously adopted by the Supreme Soviet on February 9, 1955. This document emphasizes the great responsibility of national parliaments in maintaining and consolidating peace and advocates establishing direct contacts between them.

　　Mikhailov then spoke about the many steps taken by the Soviet Union and the important role played by the Geneva Conference of the Heads of Government of the Four Powers in easing international tensions. He pointed out that certain major international problems have not yet been resolved. The great contributions of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic to the cause of peace are very obvious. However, many very important questions regarding the role and status of these countries in international politics have unfortunately not been resolved reasonably and justly to this day.

　　Mikhailov pointed out that the desire for peace is the strongest desire of the people of all countries. An international agreement on the reduction of armaments and armed forces and the prohibition of atomic weapons must be concluded as soon as possible. Mikhailov spoke about the Soviet disarmament proposals and the Soviet government's decision to reduce its armed forces by 640,000 troops. He said that the Soviet Union has taken effective steps towards disarmament.

　　The Soviet delegation believes that all national parliaments as a whole, as well as individual members of higher legislative bodies, must urge their governments to seek solutions to unresolved issues in Europe, Asia, and other parts of the world through negotiations and agreements between relevant countries.

　　Mikhailov emphasized that the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different political and economic systems is the foundation of Soviet foreign policy. The Soviet Union is consistently striving for broad international cooperation and the development of economic, scientific, and cultural ties between countries.

　　The Inter-Parliamentary Union can and should play a significant role in expanding political and economic cooperation between countries and cooperation in culture and the arts. National parliaments can exchange delegations and organize international and regional parliamentary conferences to discuss the most important issues in international life.

　　Mikhailov said that it is regrettable that this conference is not attended by representatives of the People's Republic of China, a country that plays an important role in the struggle for peace. There is no doubt that the participation of the German Democratic Republic would also contribute to the work of the conference.

　　Mikhailov concluded by saying that the Soviet delegation participating in the Inter-Parliamentary Union will do its best to enhance the Union's role in promoting peace and international cooperation.

　　Japanese representative Yamagata spoke about the Japanese people's particular concern about the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes rather than for war and the destruction of humanity.

　　French representative Monnerville pointed out that a situation of peaceful coexistence and non-interference in internal affairs between countries should be reached - this is the foundation of lasting peace. Material and spiritual disarmament should be achieved.

　　British representative Robinson believed that the participation of the Soviet delegation in the conference was a fact showing the easing of international tensions, and expressed particular satisfaction with this. He went on to say: I regret that the great Chinese delegation - the delegation of the People's Republic of China - has not been able to attend the conference. Our government recognized the People's Republic of China as early as six years ago, and I do not understand how there can still be any dispute about the right of the People's Republic of China to participate in our conference work and to become a member of our Union. This is contrary to the traditions of our Union and its desire for mutual understanding, and China should become a member of our Union. Robinson's speech was greeted with applause from many representatives.

　　Italian representative Alicata said: I propose that representatives of the People's Republic of China attend the conference before we pass resolutions on the various reports. His words also aroused applause from many representatives.

　　Indian representative Kesavan also proposed in his speech that the delegation of the People's Republic of China be accepted into the Inter-Parliamentary Union so that it could participate in the work of this conference.

　　Representatives from Romania, Brazil, and many other countries also spoke at the meeting. The meeting finally concluded the discussion of the Secretary-General's report.

    各国议会联盟大会讨论秘书长的报告
　　苏英意印等国代表主张我国代表参加大会
    新华社二十七日讯　据塔斯社赫尔辛基消息：八月二十六日，各国议会联盟第四十四届大会继续讨论秘书长的报告。
    第一个发言的是苏联代表米哈伊洛夫，他说，苏联议员们参加各国议会联盟，是以最高苏维埃一九五五年二月九日一致通过的宣言为指针的。这个文件着重指出各国议会在维护和巩固和平方面的巨大责任，并且主张在它们之间建立直接联系。
    米哈伊洛夫接着谈到苏联所采取的许多步骤以及四国政府首脑日内瓦会议在缓和国际紧张局势方面所起的重大作用。他指出，某些重大的国际问题到今天还没有得到解决。中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国对和平事业所作的巨大贡献是非常明显的。然而，关于这些国家在国际政治中的作用和地位的许多非常重要的问题，不幸到现在为止也还没有得到合理的公正的解决。
    米哈伊洛夫指出：争取和平的愿望是各国人民最强烈的愿望。必须尽早缔结关于裁减军备和武装部队以及禁止原子武器的国际协定。米哈伊洛夫谈到了苏联的裁军建议以及苏联政府裁减武装部队六十四万人的决定。他说，苏联已经采取了走向裁减军备的有效步骤。
    苏联代表团认为：所有国家的议会作为一个整体以及较高级的立法机构的个人成员都必须促使他们的政府谋求通过有关国家之间的谈判和协议来解决欧洲、亚洲以及世界其他地区的悬而未决的问题。
    米哈伊洛夫强调指出，不同政治与经济制度的国家之间和平共处的原则是苏联外交政策的基础。苏联为广泛的国际合作和发展国与国之间的经济、科学和文化联系而坚持不渝地努力。
    各国议会联盟在扩大各国间的政治、经济合作以及文化艺术合作的事业中，能够而且应当起重大的作用。各国议会可以互派代表团，组织国际性和区域性的议会代表会议来商讨国际生活中最重要的问题。
    米哈伊洛夫说，令人遗憾的是，这次大会没有中华人民共和国这样一个在争取和平的斗争中起着重要作用的国家的代表参加。毫无疑问，德意志民主共和国如果参加大会也一定会有助于大会的工作。
    米哈伊洛夫最后说，参加各国议会联盟的苏联议员团将尽力提高联盟在促进和平和国际合作的活动中的作用。
    日本代表山形在发言中讲到日本人民特别关心原子能用于和平目的、而不是用于战争和毁灭人类的问题。
    法国代表蒙纳维指出，应当达成各国之间和平共处和互不干涉内政的局面——这是持久和平的基础。应当达成物质上和精神上的裁军。
    英国代表罗宾逊认为苏联代表团参加大会是表明国际紧张局势缓和的一个事实，并对这表示特别满意。他接着说道：我对伟大的中国代表团——中华人民共和国代表团没有能够参加大会表示遗憾。我国政府早在六年之前就已承认中华人民共和国，我不明白，中华人民共和国参加我们大会工作的权利和成为我们联盟会员国的权利怎么还有争辩的余地。这是违背我们联盟的传统及它对相互谅解的愿望的，中国应当成为我们联盟的一员。罗宾逊的发言受到许多代表的鼓掌欢迎。
    意大利代表阿利卡塔说：我建议，让中华人民共和国代表在我们就各项报告通过决议之前出席大会。他的话也引起了许多代表的掌声。
    印度代表凯萨凡在发言时也提议，接受中华人民共和国代表团加入各国议会联盟，使它能够参加本届大会的工作。
    罗马尼亚、巴西等许多国家代表也在会议上发了言。会议最后结束了对秘书长报告的讨论。
