Editor's note: After the "Reader's Letters Page" of August 3 published four letters of criticism entitled "The Mistaken Practice of Rejecting Demobilized Soldiers Must Be Corrected," many readers expressed indignation at the erroneous practices of the Shanxi Provincial Labor Bureau and other units. In order to continue the struggle against this kind of mistake, today we are exposing the error of Wang Jiemin, director of the Dawu County Cooperative Union, in rejecting demobilized soldiers, and requesting the relevant leadership departments to seriously handle the matter in accordance with the State Council's "Resolution on the Work of Resettling Demobilized Construction Soldiers." In addition, Party and government departments in various localities should also learn from this lesson and conscientiously check the implementation of the State Council's resolution.

The Xiaogan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China should seriously deal with Wang Jiemin's mistake of rejecting demobilized soldiers.
Editor:
　　Some demobilized soldiers with driving skills in Dawu County, Hubei Province, needed to be resettled. At the end of May this year, the County Demobilized Construction Committee heard that the Dawu County Cooperative Union (hereinafter referred to as the County Union) was preparing to buy a car, so they contacted them repeatedly. The County Union was in urgent need of personnel at the time, so they employed Zhong Ganqing, a demobilized soldier, with a "let's give it a try" attitude. Because the County Union's diesel car still needed an assistant, we continued to ask them to select a driver from the demobilized soldiers. At that time, Comrade Gu, who was in charge of personnel work in the County Union, verbally said that he would discuss it with the leadership, but there was no reply after that.
　　On June 28, the County Union hired a driver from another place without going through the labor and personnel departments. We went to the County Union to discuss it on the afternoon of the 29th. Wang Jiemin (member of the Dawu County Committee of the Communist Party of China), director of the County Union, met with us and began by preemptively blaming Zhong Ganqing, whom we had introduced earlier, for being honest but unskilled, and boasting about the driver he had hired in Hankou, who was slippery but skilled (which was not actually the case); then he used the excuse that demobilized soldiers could not be "absorbed casually without principle" to reject our request. After we repeatedly raised our opinions, he reluctantly agreed to "study" the matter. Who knew that soon after we left, he went to talk to Deputy County Chief Chen in a huff, and later Deputy County Chief Chen told us: "The county party committee's opinion is, forget it, forget it."
　　We believe that it was very wrong for the County Union to use deceptive means to refuse to employ demobilized soldiers, so we requested the higher authorities to deal with it. Director Wang Jiemin saw this situation and adopted deliberate means of making things difficult. He ordered the privately hired driver to go back temporarily and notified us to send the files of the demobilized soldiers for review. We submitted three files. In less than half a day, Wang Jiemin sent the three files to the Civil Affairs Section, turned around and left without saying a word. When the comrades in the Civil Affairs Section asked why, Wang Jiemin said: "One (non-Party member) has good skills, but had corruption behavior before the Three-Anti campaign and has a poor ideological consciousness; the other two (Party members) have no other problems, but their skills are not good. We don't need them."
　　On July 2, we went to the County Union again, and Wang Jiemin repeated these reasons. In fact, although this non-Party member demobilized soldier had corruption behavior before and after liberation, he had a very good attitude during the Three-Anti campaign and returned the ill-gotten gains, so he was not punished in any way; there were no problems after the Three-Anti campaign, and the main shortcomings on the appraisal material were only "strong personality". The other two Communist Party members had been drivers in the army for two or three years, and they were qualified to be an assistant in any case. After we raised the above opinions, Wang Jiemin stammered and said: "This issue needs to be treated with caution, we are prepared to allocate internally."
　　Wang Jiemin, director of the Dawu County Union, as a member of the County Party Committee, discriminated against demobilized soldiers and refused to employ them, which is very inappropriate. We request the higher-level leading organs to seriously deal with this issue.

The transferred soldier who maintained the honor of a revolutionary soldier
Editor:
　　After reading the newspaper's criticisms of certain organs excluding demobilized and transferred soldiers, I felt very angry. As far as I know, demobilized and transferred soldiers are generally revolutionary fighters who have been tested in combat, and they can overcome difficulties and successfully complete their tasks in their work posts. Here, let me introduce the deeds of Comrade Yang Wenkai (currently working in the Daokou Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Leshan County), a model worker of first class in our county, as proof.
　　Comrade Yang Wenkai is a Communist Party member, and he was transferred from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army to his hometown in June 1952. In January 1953, he worked in the Yuelai Branch of the First District Supply and Marketing Cooperative. He was responsible for sorting and managing all local products, general merchandise, fabrics, and farm tools. He had never done commercial work before, so in order to become familiar with the business, he sincerely asked Comrade Wang Fanghe, who was sent by the district cooperative to help with the work (going there every other day), to learn how to use the abacus and keep accounts. Because he was very busy during the day, he tried to prepare for business every morning, weighing and packing the goods needed by the masses on a daily basis, so that the masses could pick them up and leave when they bought them, which was quick and convenient. In this way, he studied whenever he had time, and sometimes he stayed up late at night. Thanks to his hard work, he quickly learned how to use the abacus, keep accounts, and close accounts. Yang Wenkai also paid attention to studying and improving the supply of production materials. When he first came to the Yuelai Branch, he found that scythes, sickles, and grass knives were sold very little; the peasants needed these farm tools very much, but they all went to Hanyangba in Qingshen County to buy them. What was the reason for this? He went deep into the masses to investigate and learned that the local area was a mountainous area, and the ironware used by the peasants needed to be lighter. The farm tools of the cooperative were too heavy, and the peasants felt they were not easy to use and the prices were high. Therefore, he promptly reported this situation to the higher-level cooperative, and later, through the introduction of the Leshan Special District Finance and Economic Committee, he directly purchased goods from the Qingshen County Cooperative Union, which gave the masses great convenience. He also paid great attention to the management of production materials, often wiping ironware with ash and often turning over bamboo ware to dry in the sun, thus avoiding mold, rust, and insect infestation.
　　Because Comrade Yang Wenkai has consistently worked actively, studied his business diligently, and served the peasant masses and agricultural production with enthusiasm since he was transferred to his hometown, he was rated as a model worker of first class in the whole county in 1954, and was selected as a model worker of first class to attend the Leshan Special District Office Labor Model Conference of the Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative in May this year. There are tens of thousands of good comrades like Comrade Yang Wenkai among the demobilized and transferred soldiers. Therefore, I wonder, what reason do these units have to refuse demobilized and transferred soldiers to participate in work?

### 认真检查安置复员军人的工作

　　认真检查安置复员军人的工作
　  编者按：八月三日“读者来信专页”发表了以“必须纠正排斥复员军人的错误做法”为题的四封批评信以后，很多读者来信对山西省劳动局等单位的错误做法表示愤慨。为了继续同这种错误作斗争，今天我们再揭发大悟县合作社联合社主任王杰民排斥复员军人的错误，要求有关领导部门按照国务院“关于安置复员建设军人工作的决议”严肃处理。此外，各地党政部门也应从中吸取教训，认真检查国务院决议的执行情况。
　　中共孝感地委应该严肃处理王杰民排斥复员军人的错误编辑同志：
    湖北省大悟县有一部分有驾驶技术的复员军人需要安置。今年五月底，县转业建设委员会听说大悟县合作社联合社（以下简称县联社）准备买汽车，就同他们再三联系。县联社当时用人很急，才抱着“试试看”的态度录用了复员军人钟干卿。因为县联社的柴油车还需要助手，我们又继续要求他们选用复员军人中的司机人员。当时县联社负责人事工作的顾同志口头上说要同领导上研究，但是以后却一直没有答复。
    六月二十八日，县联社不通过劳动部门和人事部门就从外地找来了一个司机。我们在二十九日下午就到县联社去商谈。县联社主任王杰民（中共大悟县委委员）同我们接谈，开始是先发制人地责备我们先介绍的钟干卿人虽老实而技术不行，吹嘘他在汉口雇请的司机，人虽然滑头，可是技术行（实际上并不如此）；接着就用对复员军人不能“无原则地随便吸收”作借口拒绝我们的要求。经我们再三提出意见，他才勉强答应要“研究”一下。谁知道我们刚走不久，他就气呼呼地去找陈副县长谈了一下，后来陈副县长告诉我们说：“县委的意见，算了，算了。”
    我们认为县联社用欺骗手段拒绝录用复员军人是非常错误的，就提请上级处理。王杰民主任看到这个情况，又采取了故意刁难的手段。他一面叫私自雇请的司机暂时回去，一面通知我们把复员军人的档案送去审查。我们交去档案三份。不到半晌时间，王杰民就将三份档案材料送到民政科，不声不响转身就走。民政科的同志追问原因，王杰民说：“有一个（非党员）技术还好，但三反前有贪污行为，思想意识差；那两个（党员）没有其他问题，技术又不行。我们不用。”
    七月二日，我们又到县联社去，王杰民重复这些理由。实际上，这个非党员的复员军人在解放前后虽然有过贪污行为，但是三反中态度很好，退出了赃款，因而没有受任何处分；三反后也没有什么问题，鉴定材料上的主要缺点只是“个性强”。另外两个共产党员在部队都当了两三年的司机，当一名助手无论如何是够条件的。我们提出了上述意见后，王杰民吞吞吐吐地说：“这个问题要慎重，我们准备就在内部调配。”
    大悟县联社主任王杰民身为县委委员，竟歧视复员军人，拒绝录用，这是很不应该的。我们要求上级领导机关严肃处理这个问题。

　　保持了革命军人荣誉的转业军人编辑同志：
    看了报纸上对某些机关排斥复员转业军人的批评以后，我感到很愤怒。据我了解，复员转业军人一般地都是经过战斗考验的革命战士，在工作岗位上都能克服困难，出色地完成任务，这里，让我介绍一下我县甲等工作模范杨文凯同志（现在乐山县道口乡供销社工作）的事迹来作证明吧。
    杨文凯同志是共产党员，一九五二年六月由解放军某部转业回乡。一九五三年一月，他在第一区供销合作社悦来分销店工作，所有土产、百货、布匹、农具等都由他一个人整理、经营。他从来没有做过商业工作，为了熟悉业务，就诚恳地找区社派下去帮助工作（隔一天去一次）的王方和同志学打算盘和弄账。因为白天工作很忙，他就想办法在每天清早做好业务准备工作，把群众日常需要的货品称好包起，群众买的时候拿起就走，快当省事。这样，他一有时间就学习，有的时候，晚上还熬夜。由于他这样的勤苦学习，很快学会了打算盘、记账和结账。杨文凯还注意研究改进了生产资料的供应工作，他一来悦来分销店就发现镰刀、弯刀、草刀等卖得很少；农民很需要这些农具，但是都到青神县的汉阳坝去买。这是什么原因呢？他就深入群众调查，了解到当地是山区，农民用的铁器需要轻一些，合作社的农具都太重，农民感到不好用，价格又高。于是，他把这种情况及时向上级合作社反映，后来经过专区财政经济委员会的介绍，直接向青神县合作社联合社进货，给了群众很大的便利。他对生产资料管理得也很注意，铁器经常用灰擦，竹器也经常翻晒，因而避免了霉、锈和虫蛀等现象的发生。
    由于杨文凯同志转业回乡以后一贯积极工作，钻研业务，热诚地为农民群众和农业生产服务，因此，一九五四年被评为全县甲等工作模范，今年五月又被选为出席四川省供销合作总社乐山专区办事处劳动模范大会的甲等模范。像杨文凯同志这样的好同志，在复员转业军人中有着成千上万。因此，我奇怪，这些单位有什么理由来拒绝复员转业军人参加工作呢？四川省乐山县供销合作社　周岐康
