　　My Peking Opera Troupe and Japanese Kabuki Troupe
　　Will Make Mutual Performance Visits

　　Three representatives from the Japanese Grand Kabuki Troupe, led by Matsuo Kunizo, and Naramasaki Tomio, representing the President of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Matsuyama Jiichiro, came to China at the invitation of the Chinese People's Association For Cultural Relation with Foreign Countries. Since arriving in Beijing on the 10th, they have held discussions with the Chinese People's Association For Cultural Relation with Foreign Countries on promoting cultural exchange between the people of China and Japan through the exchange of theatrical arts performances. On the 22nd, both sides reached a satisfactory agreement, deciding that the Japanese side would send a 58-member Kabuki troupe, headed by the famous Japanese actor Ichikawa Ennosuke, to visit Beijing and other major cities in China for a month of performances during the 1955 Chinese National Day. The Chinese side will send a Peking Opera troupe to visit Tokyo and other major cities in Japan in April and May of 1956.

　　After reaching the agreement, Matsuo Kunizo and others left Beijing by plane on August 23 via Guangzhou to return to their country. Yang Hansheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association For Cultural Relation with Foreign Countries, and Japanese peace figures in Beijing, including Kameta Togo, Kaneko Kenta, and Nakamura Kanyaemon, were at the airport to see them off.
