    Firmly, Thoroughly, Cleanly, and Completely Eliminate All Counter-Revolutionary Elements
    Stop Just Saying "I Really Didn't Expect That"
    Lao She
    In the movement to eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and purify the literary and artistic ranks, I have repeatedly heard the phrase "I really didn't expect that." I myself have said it more than once. "Who? Him too? Really, I really didn't expect that!"

    The things that "I really didn't expect" are the things that I never thought about before. The problem lies here: "Class struggle," "heighten vigilance," etc., aren't these constantly on our lips? Why didn't we combine them with reality and think about them, so that we can only say "I really didn't expect that" until the crimes of the counter-revolutionary elements are exposed? Naive? Such naivete is nothing to boast about! I'm afraid we're just beautifying our carelessness and negligence as naivete, right? Upon closer inspection: "I really didn't expect that" is actually slapping ourselves in the face, and with a loud smack!

    Put away our "I really didn't expect that"! Stop using "naivete" to forgive yourselves! We should find the vigilance we have already lost, and add to it twofold, threefold, even a hundredfold!

    Without a high degree of vigilance, the victory of the revolution will be difficult to consolidate. Look, our carelessness and sloppiness have allowed Hu Feng to sway back and forth among us for twenty years, and even often "shake hands and make peace" with us!

    "I really didn't expect that" also contains a sense of unreasonableness. Let's take Hu Feng as an example again. After liberation, the government took care of him in every way, giving him salary, giving him status, uniting him, advising him... According to reason, he should be grateful. How could he engage in counter-revolution instead? Isn't this unreasonable? Hmph, it depends on whose reason you're talking about. Hu Feng's "reason" is precisely eating the people's food, drinking the people's water, while gnashing his teeth and hating the people. Naive, we are always naively judging counter-revolutionaries by common human feelings, and thus can only end up saying "I really didn't expect that"!

    Hu Feng's reason is like that, while our reason is like this—being broad-minded, striving to make even stubborn rocks nod in agreement. As a result, Hu Feng took the salary given by the people, ate until he was fat and plump, and worked day and night to figure out how to avenge the landlord class and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. He didn't forget the class struggle. But we put it aside, thinking that the world was already at peace and we could rest easy. Look at the newspapers these days, how rampant are the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements all over the country!

    Want to talk about reason? You must first see clearly the revolutionary environment, know yourself and know your enemy. Only by recognizing the problem in this way can we estimate that the enemy will make a desperate struggle, and we must be prepared at all times to protect our revolutionary victory like protecting our eyes. Only when we never forget the revolution and never forget the class struggle can we be considered reasonable!

    This is the reason of the revolution: we want to build socialism, and the enemy wants to teach Chiang Kai-shek and all the rotten things to be restored, which is clearly a life-and-death struggle. If we slacken, the enemy will succeed; if the enemy succeeds, we will suffer. That's the long and short of it, that's the reason!

    The enemy hates all our people and all our things. This is their "reason." As for us, we have laws to suppress counter-revolutionaries, act according to the law, and never let go of a single counter-revolutionary, nor wrong a single good person. This is our reason. We must never condone evil and be harmed by others' tricks. Patting the tiger's head and teaching it to thank you and not bite you is a stupid thing!

    "I really didn't expect that" may even be secretly giving a thumbs up, expressing admiration. This is absolutely unacceptable! "Oh dear! He, him too..." secretly adding in your heart: "This guy has some skills!" That's right, if the enemy didn't have some skills, how could our warehouses and buildings have been burned down, and how could our cadres have been murdered! Secretly giving a thumbs up? Is there still any patriotism and revolutionary enthusiasm? No matter who he is, as long as he is a counter-revolutionary, we should hate him and reach out and grab him! There is absolutely no compromise between the enemy and us, and we can never coexist peacefully!

    Recognize it clearly, this is indeed a most acute struggle. The more sharply we struggle, the more deeply we can penetrate the enemy's ranks and the sooner we can achieve victory. Only seeking to hastily end the battle in a quick and easy manner will certainly lead to an uncertain outcome and an incomplete victory! This kind of attitude is unacceptable!

    Just thwarting the enemy's prestige is not enough, why bother pursuing the defeated bandits, this is also an unacceptable attitude. The enemy's purpose is to subvert our regime, and they use this as the criterion for everything, big or small. Can we casually roll up our flags and drums and deliberately leave behind future troubles? The enemy will attack and also retreat according to the situation. Attacks are planned, and retreats are also planned; if we just "touch upon the matter" and only make a show of force, how can we not be laughed at by the enemy!

    Another attitude is also unacceptable: when the time comes, follow the meetings, follow the studies, just like going to work when the time comes and getting off work when the time comes, not saying an extra word, not taking an extra step. This is treating the struggle and the movement as a perfunctory matter, not taking it to heart at all. This must not be allowed. You must see clearly: only by personally and actively participating in the struggle can you train yourself and make the revolutionary enthusiasm penetrate into your bones. Class struggle is definitely not just a matter of shouting a few slogans after other people! Demand yourself to be a veritable literary and artistic warrior. Otherwise, we will not be able to thoroughly purify our ranks, and we will not be able to shoulder the heavy responsibility of socialist construction!

    Just as it is for literary and artistic workers, so it is for the people of the whole country. All should throw away "I really didn't expect that," and instead stand tall, open their eyes wide, and strive to train themselves into revolutionary fighters in this movement! The amazement of "I really didn't expect that" is an unbidden admission of our weakness of losing vigilance, and also indicates that we do not hate or are not angry at the enemy! Hate your enemy, learn how a patriot should be angry, and in this movement, be sure to teach the enemy a crushing defeat from which they can never recover!

### 别光说“真没想到”啊

    坚决、彻底、干净、全部地肃清一切反革命分子
    别光说“真没想到”啊
    老舍
    在肃清胡风反革命集团、纯洁文艺队伍的运动中，我屡屡听到“真没想到”这句话。我自己也这么说过不止一次。“谁？他也是？真，真没想到！”
      “真没想到”的事就是向来没那么想过的事。问题就在这里：“阶级斗争”、“提高警惕”等等，不是经常挂在咱们的嘴边上么？为什么咱们没结合着实际去想一想，直到反革命分子的罪行被揭发了，才只能道一声“真没想到”呢？天真么？这样的天真是无可夸口的！恐怕倒是把咱们的粗心和麻痹大意都美其名为天真了吧？细一想：“真没想到”实在是我们打自己的嘴巴，而且打得怪响！
    收起我们的“真没想到”吧！别再用“天真”原谅自己吧！应当把我们已经丢掉的警惕找回来，再添上一倍两倍以至百倍吧！
    没有高度的警惕，革命的胜利就难以巩固。看，我们马马虎虎，大大咧咧，就使胡风在我们之间摇来摆去二十年之久，还时常跟我们“握手言欢”啊！
      “真没想到”也含有不近情理的意思。还以胡风来说吧，解放后，政府处处照顾他，给他薪资，给他地位，团结他，劝告他……。按情理说，他应当感激，怎么反而闹反革命呢？这不大近情理啊。哼，这就要看是谁的情理了。胡风的“情理”正是吃着人民，喝着人民，而咬牙切齿地恨人民。天真啊，咱们总是天真地以人之常情判断反革命，于是就只能落个“真没想到”了！
    胡风的情理如彼，而我们的情理如此——宽大为怀，务期使顽石点头。于是，胡风拿着人民给的薪资，吃得肥肥胖胖的，日夜不息地琢磨怎么为地主阶级和蒋匪帮复仇。他没忘了阶级斗争。我们却把它放在一边，认为天下已经太平，可以高枕无忧。看看这几天的报纸吧，全国到处反革命分子的破坏活动有多么猖狂啊！
    讲情理吗？得先看清楚革命环境，知己知彼。这么认识问题，才能估计到敌人必作垂死的挣扎，我们必须时刻防备，保卫我们的革命胜利像保护我们的眼珠子。我们时刻不忘革命，不忘阶级斗争，才算近情理！
    这是革命的情理：咱们要建设社会主义，敌人要教蒋匪和一切腐烂的东西复辟，分明是你死我活的斗争。咱们松懈，敌人得手；敌人得手，咱们吃亏。就是这么一笔账，这就是情理！
    敌人恨我们一切的人，一切的事。这是他们的
  “情理”。我们呢，有镇压反革命的法律，依法办事，不放过一个反革命，也不冤枉一个好人。这是我们的情理。咱们万不能姑息养奸，受人家的暗算。拍拍老虎的头，教它感谢你，不咬你，是愚蠢的事！
      “真没想到”或者甚至于是暗伸大指，表示佩服的意思。这顶要不得！“哎呀！他，他也是……”心中暗暗补上：“这家伙有两下子！”就是嘛，敌人要没有两下子，咱们的仓库、大楼怎么会烧了呢，干部们怎会教人家谋杀了呢！暗伸大指吗？还有没有一点爱国心和革命热情呢？不管他是谁，只要是反革命，咱们就该痛恨，伸手抓住他！敌我之间绝对没有妥协，绝对不能和平共处！
    认清楚吧，这的的确确是一场最尖锐的斗争。我们斗争得越尖锐，才越能深入敌阵，越早得到胜利。只求三下五除二地急忙结束战斗，一定胜负难分，搞不彻底！这种态度要不得！
    挫挫敌人的威风就算了，何必穷追败寇，这也是要不得的态度。敌人的目的是在颠覆我们的政权，他们事无大小，以此为准。我们能随便卷旗息鼓，故意留下后患吗？敌人会进攻，也会相机退却。攻有计划，退也有计划；我们若是“点到而已”，只虚张声势一番，怎能不被敌人笑掉大牙！
    另一个态度也要不得：到时候跟着开会，跟着学习，正如到时候上班，到时候下班，多一句不说，多一步不走。这是把斗争和运动看成应付公事，丝毫不往心里去。这一定要不得。要看明白：只有亲自积极参加斗争，才能锻炼自己，才能使革命的热情深入到骨髓里去。阶级斗争一定不是随着人家喊几句口号的事！以作一个名符其实的文艺战士要求自己吧。要不然，我们就不会彻底纯洁我们的队伍，也就担负不起社会主义建设的重任！
    文艺工作者如此，全国人民也如此，都该把“真没想到”扔掉，改为挺起胸膛，擦亮眼睛，争取在这个运动中把自己锻炼成革命的战士！“真没想到”的惊异是不打自招地承认了我们失去警惕的弱点，而且也表示对敌人并不痛恨，并不愤怒！痛恨你的敌人吧，学会一个爱国者应当怎样愤怒吧，在这运动中一定要教敌人一败涂地，永难翻身！
