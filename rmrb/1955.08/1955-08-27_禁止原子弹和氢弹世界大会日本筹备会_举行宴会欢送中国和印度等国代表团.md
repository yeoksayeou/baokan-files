Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 26th: The Japan Preparatory Committee for the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held a banquet on the evening of the 25th to see off the delegations from China, India, and other countries attending the World Conference.

　　Trade union delegations from the Soviet Union, Germany, Indonesia, and other countries currently visiting Japan were also invited to attend the banquet.

　　Japanese participants included representatives from the Japan Preparatory Committee, such as Akira Kazami and Yoshitaro Hirano, Secretary-General Ikuo Yasui, Permanent Secretary of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan Minoru Takano, representative of the Japan Association for the Protection of Children Sayako Hani, Secretary-General of the All-Japan Federation of Women's Organizations Kinu Suzuki, members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party Kenji Miyamoto and Ryuji Nishizawa, and representatives from various sectors and organizations, including Eiun Otani, chairman of the Executive Committee for the Memorial Service for Chinese Martyrs, totaling more than eighty people.

　　Akira Kazami, representing the Japan Preparatory Committee, delivered a speech of thanks to the foreign delegations, saying: Thanks to the strong support of various countries around the world, the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs has achieved great success.

　　Ikuo Yasui reported on the situation of the Japanese movement to ban atomic weapons after the World Conference. He said that people from all walks of life in Japan are carrying out activities in accordance with the resolutions passed by the conference to further develop the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs. At the same time, the movement to provide relief to victims of atomic and hydrogen bombs is also being carried out nationwide. He then read a letter at the meeting from the Japan Preparatory Committee, on behalf of Japanese atomic and hydrogen bomb victims and the Japanese people, thanking six Chinese people's organizations. The letter stated: The 50,000 yuan consolation money sent by the representatives of the six Chinese people's organizations on behalf of the Chinese people to the Japan Preparatory Committee expresses the deep sympathy of the Chinese people for the unfortunate experiences of Japanese atomic and hydrogen bomb victims. The Japan Preparatory Committee will, in accordance with the wishes of the Chinese people, use this consolation money most effectively for the victims of atomic and hydrogen bombs.

　　Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese delegation, then delivered a speech, saying: The conference against atomic and hydrogen bombs, whether held in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Osaka, Kamakura, or Tokyo, not only expressed the common aspirations of the Japanese people, but also expressed the common aspirations of the broad masses of people around the world. He pointed out: The people of the world and the people of Japan have jointly issued the call "No more atomic bombs!" The noble efforts of the Japanese people in opposing atomic weapons have won the support and respect of peace-loving people in all countries. The Japanese people's strong hatred of atomic weapons has further isolated those who clamor for atomic war. Liu Ningyi stated that when the Chinese delegation returns, they will definitely bring back the Japanese people's friendship to the Chinese people, and will definitely tell the Chinese people about the suffering of Japanese atomic weapon victims that they have witnessed. He hoped that the atomic bomb victims and their families would turn grief into strength. He concluded by saying: This force, combined with the force of people in all countries around the world to defend peace, will converge into a huge torrent.

　　举行宴会欢送中国和印度等国代表团
    新华社二十六日讯　东京消息：禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会日本筹备会在二十五日晚上举行宴会，欢送出席世界大会的中国、印度等国代表团。
    正在日本访问的苏联、德国、印度尼西亚等国工会代表团也应邀出席了宴会。
    日本方面参加宴会的有日本筹备会代表委员风见章、平野义太郎，秘书长安井郁，日本工会总评议会常任干事高野实，日本保卫儿童会代表羽仁说子，全日本妇女团体联合会总书记铃木绢，日本共产党中央委员宫本显治、西泽隆二，中国俘虏殉难者追悼执行委员会委员长大谷莹润等各界各团体代表八十多人。
    风见章代表日本筹备会向外国代表团致谢词说：由于世界各国的强有力的支持，禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会获得了巨大的成功。
    安井郁在会上向各国代表报告了世界大会以后日本要求禁止原子武器运动的情况。他说，日本国内各阶层人们按照大会通过的决议，正在展开活动以更进一步发展禁止原子弹和氢弹运动。同时，救济原子弹和氢弹受害者的运动也在全国范围开展起来。他接着在会上宣读了日本筹备会代表日本原子弹和氢弹受害者和日本人民向中国六个人民团体致谢的一封信。这封信说：中国六个人民团体代表中国人民送给日本筹备会的五万元慰问金，表示着中国人民对日本原子弹和氢弹受害者的不幸遭遇的深切同情。日本筹备会一定要依照中国人民的希望，最有效地为原子弹和氢弹受害者使用这笔慰问金。
    中国代表团团长刘宁一接着致词说：禁止原子弹和氢弹的大会，不论是在广岛开的，长崎开的，大阪开的，镰仓开的，东京开的，都不仅表达了日本人民的共同愿望，也表达了世界广大人民的共同愿望。他指出：全世界人民和日本人民一起发出了“不准再投原子弹”的呼声。日本人民为反对原子武器所作的崇高努力，已经获得了所有爱好和平的各国人民的支持和尊敬。日本人民对原子武器的强烈的憎恨，已经使原子战争的叫嚣者更加孤立。刘宁一表示，中国代表团回去的时候，一定要把日本人民对中国人民的友情带回去，一定要把亲眼看到的日本原子武器受害者的痛苦情况告诉中国人民。他希望原子弹受害者和他们的家属们化悲愤为力量。他最后说：这种力量同世界各国人民保卫和平的力量结合起来，将汇成一股巨大的洪流。
