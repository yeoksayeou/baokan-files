    Anhui Province's oil pressing industry workers have increased the production of vegetable oil for the country by more than 3,130,000 jin in the first half of the year.

    The oil pressing industry in Anhui Province has widely promoted Li Chuanjiang's advanced oil pressing experience, and improved production equipment and operation methods in light of local conditions, increasing the oil yield. For example, the Fuyang Oil Factory added earthen kang (heated platforms) to soften the soybeans. In the first half of the year, the average oil yield was 13.2 jin, an increase of 1.58 jin compared to 1954. The Bo County Oil Factory improved its operation methods, increasing the soybean oil yield from 11 jin to 14 jin. The increase in vegetable oil production in the province due to the increase in oil yield was 1,501,500 jin.

    The oil pressing industry workers have also worked hard to open up new oil sources and find substitutes. In the first half of the year, a total of 42 new oil sources were discovered in the province. Seven types have been allocated for processing: rice bran, mountain walnuts, tea seeds, Su sesame seeds, Chinese cork tree seeds, Torreya grandis, and mud beans. The total increase in oil production was 1,036,700 jin.

    安徽省榨油工业增产植物油
    安徽省榨油工业职工上半年为国家增产了三百一十三万多斤植物油。
    安徽榨油工业普遍推广了李川江先进榨油经验，并结合本地情况改进了生产设备和操作方法，提高了出油率。如阜阳油厂增设了土炕，软化大豆，上半年平均出油率为十三点二斤，比一九五四年提高了一点五八斤。亳县油厂改进了操作方法，使大豆出油率由十一斤提高到十四斤。全省因出油率提高增产的植物油有一百五十万一千五百多斤。
    榨油业的职工还努力开辟新油源、寻找代用品。上半年全省共发现四十二种新油源，已拨付加工的有米糠、山核桃、茶叶籽、苏麻籽、黄连树籽、香榧、泥豆七种。共增产油一百零三万六千七百多斤。
