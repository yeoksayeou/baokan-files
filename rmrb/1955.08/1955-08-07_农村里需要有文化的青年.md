To the Editor:

    I graduated from junior high school last year. Because I didn't pass the high school entrance exam, I returned to my village to participate in agricultural production.

    After returning to the village, I heard some people gossiping, saying, "A middle school student coming back to till the land is a failure!" My parents also complained, "We supported you to study for so many years, hoping you would graduate from university and make something of yourself; who knew you would be so disappointing, ending up back home with a hoe." I felt very sad and was afraid of "suffering" in labor and being "clumsy" at work, so I stayed at home all day, not wanting to do anything.

    The township officials and the Communist Youth League comrades learned about my state of mind and often comforted me, also telling me many model stories of students participating in production. Xu Gengsheng, the secretary of the Youth League branch, told me, "Tang Zhiliang in our township is also a junior high school graduate. After returning, he actively participated in labor and is now a League member. He serves as the work point recorder for the mutual aid team and the accountant for the township credit cooperative. Everyone praises him!" This real-life example in our locality moved my heart, and I resolved to participate in agricultural production.

    I went to the fields with my parents and the members of the mutual aid team, first learning to harvest rice. At first, I cut very slowly, and a lot of the grain fell off. The rice bundles were also placed haphazardly. After cutting rice for a day, my back ached, and I had blisters on my hands. However, I was very excited in my heart. The next day, I continued to learn to harvest rice. After three or four days, I became more skilled. After a period of labor, I had almost learned all the farm work. I deeply felt the joy of labor.

    In addition to participating in daily agricultural labor, I also scheduled a certain amount of study time for myself every day. For example, I continuously write a diary, recording my experiences in labor and my insights from reading. I also use my rest time to read newspapers to the team members.

    Now, I am already the work point recorder for the team and also serve as the village statistician (leader of the agricultural and forestry statistics team). My relationship with the masses is also becoming closer and closer. I deeply feel that rural areas desperately need young people with a certain level of education. There are too many things they can do for the farmers.

    I am still a new recruit on the agricultural production front. In the future, I will continue to humbly learn from the masses, learn, and master all agricultural production techniques. I will also research and improve old-fashioned farm tools and farming techniques, produce more grain, and support the country's socialist industrialization, so that our farmers can use tractors as soon as possible.

### 农村里需要有文化的青年

    农村里需要有文化的青年编辑同志：
    我在去年初中毕业，因为没有考上高中，就回乡参加了农业生产。
    回到村里以后，就听见有些人风言风语地说：“中学生回来耕田，没出息！”我的父母也埋怨我说：“供你读了那末多年书，指望你读到大学毕业，干一番事业；谁想你不争气，到头还是回家拿锄头。”我感到很伤心，又怕参加劳动要“吃苦”，干活又“外行”，因此整天呆坐在家里，什么事也不想干。
    乡里的工作人员和青年团的同志们了解了我的思想情况后，就经常安慰我，还讲了很多学生参加生产的模范事迹。团支部书记许根生同志告诉我：“我们乡里的唐志良也是一个初中毕业生，他回来后积极参加劳动，现在已经成为团员了。他担任了互助组的计工员，乡信用合作社的会计，谁不夸他！”这个出现在本地的实际事例打动了我的心，我下定了参加农业生产的决心。
    我跟着父母和互助组的组员们一起下田，先学割稻。我起初割得很慢，还把谷弄得脱落了不少，稻把也摆得横七竖八的；割了一天稻子，就腰酸背疼，手上起泡。但是，我心里却是十分兴奋的。第二天，我继续学割稻。三四天后，我割的就比较熟练了，经过一段时间的劳动以后，我差不多学会了全部农活。我深深体会到劳动的快乐。
    除了参加日常的农业劳动，我每天还给自己安排了一定的学习时间。例如我不间断地写日记，有了劳动的体会和读书的心得也都写出来。我还利用休息的时间给组员们读报纸。
    现在，我已经是组里的计工员，还担任全村的统计员（农林统计组的组长）。我同群众的关系也愈来愈密切了。我深深地感到农村中十分需要有一定文化程度的青年人，他们能为农民做的事情太多了。
    我还是一个农业生产战线上的新兵，今后要继续向群众虚心学习，学会并且精通一切农业生产技术。我还要研究改进旧式农具和耕作技术，多打粮食，支援国家的社会主义工业化，好让我们农民早日用上拖拉机。
