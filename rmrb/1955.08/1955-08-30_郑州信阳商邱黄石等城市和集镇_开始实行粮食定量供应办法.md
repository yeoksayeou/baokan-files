Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 29th. In August, seven cities in Henan Province, including Zhengzhou, Xinyang, Shangqiu, Nanyang, Luohe, Zhumadian, and Zhoukou, as well as five other larger towns, have begun to implement a grain rationing system for urban and rural residents. Collective catering units such as government agencies, schools, and state-owned enterprises in these towns have developed monthly grain consumption plans based on the verified number of people and different rationing standards, and have exchanged them for new grain supply certificates for urban and rural residents. After these cities and towns implemented the grain rationing system, grain waste was reduced, and the amount of grain used decreased. Currently, in cities like Xinyang, Nanyang, and Zhoukou, a trend of "wasting grain is shameful, and saving grain is glorious" has initially formed among the citizens. Citizens can arrange grain consumption in accordance with the national grain rationing standards.

After the Henan Provincial People's Committee convened a meeting on grain rationing for seventeen small and medium-sized cities in mid-July, various localities investigated the grain consumption of residents, registered and verified the population, classified supply categories, and trained cadres. Local CCP committees and government leaders personally led this work.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 29th. Huangshi City, Hubei Province, has been piloting grain rationing measures for more than a month. Starting in August, factories, mines, state-owned enterprises, and other units have officially implemented the interim measures for grain rationing in urban and rural areas promulgated by the State Council.

According to the person in charge of the Finance and Trade Office of Huangshi City, the results of the pilot implementation of grain rationing measures have proven that the prescribed rationing standards are reasonable. A considerable proportion of the local population engaged in special heavy physical labor can consume an average of 50 jin of rice per month. Units with complex types of work such as Daye Steel Plant have done a good job of investigation and research before classifying and grading, avoiding excessively high or low rations during rationing, and workers are satisfied.

Since July, Huangshi City has conducted publicity and education on rationing for citizens throughout the city. In the past two months, citizens of Huangshi City have written letters to the grain department and local newspapers to expose waste of grain and hoarding of grain. Citizens have also promoted good cooking methods such as the "steaming rice with raw rice method." It is expected that after the city fully implements the interim measures for grain rationing in urban and rural areas from September, the monthly sales volume of grain will decrease by about 200,000 jin compared with August.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, August 29th. Seven major cities in Zhejiang Province, including Hangzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Shaoxing, and Jinhua, will implement a grain rationing system before September 16th.

Hangzhou City and its subordinate districts have established grain rationing offices and have established grain rationing working groups in accordance with twenty-four systems including industry, commerce, transportation, finance, and culture and education. In order to make it easier for the masses to purchase grain, the city grain bureau has adjusted the city's grain supply points. Various organizations, groups, factories, and enterprises have generally launched publicity work on grain rationing.

Ningbo City has also established city and district grain rationing offices. The city has also trained more than a thousand resident cadres. Wenzhou City has established a grain unified purchase and sales working committee, requiring responsible cadres from all agencies, groups, enterprises, and residential areas to personally lead this work.

The work of verifying the population in Huzhou, Jiaxing, Jinhua, Shaoxing and other cities has ended, and the work of classification and rationing has been initially completed.

　　郑州信阳商邱黄石等城市和集镇
　　开始实行粮食定量供应办法
    新华社郑州二十九日电　八月份，河南省郑州、信阳、商邱、南阳、漯河、驻马店、周口七个城市和其他五个较大的集镇，已经开始实行市镇粮食定量供应的制度。这些城镇的机关、学校、国营企业等集体伙食单位，已根据核定的人数和不同的定量标准，制定了按月的用粮计划，换取了新的市镇居民粮食供应证。这些城市、集镇的居民实行粮食定量供应制度后，减少了粮食浪费，用粮数量都有减少。现在信阳、南阳、周口等城市市民中，已初步形成了“浪费粮食可耻，节约粮食光荣”的风气。市民们都能按照国家粮食定量供应标准，安排粮食消费。
    河南省人民委员会在七月中旬召开全省十七个中小城镇粮食定量供应会议以后，各地都曾调查了居民粮食消费情况，登记核实人口，划分供应类别，并训练了干部。当地中共党委和政府负责人都亲自领导这个工作。
    新华社武汉二十九日电　湖北省黄石市试行粮食定量供应办法已有一个多月了，从八月份开始，各工厂、矿山、国营企业等单位，首先正式实行了国务院颁布的市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法。
    据黄石市财粮贸办公室负责人说，试行粮食定量供应办法的结果，证明规定的定量标准是合理的。占当地人口相当一部分的特殊重体力劳动者，每人每月平均消费大米五十斤就够了。大冶钢厂等工种复杂的单位，在分类划等前做好了调查研究工作，避免定量时发生偏高偏低现象，工人都感到满意。
    七月份以来，黄石市对全市市民进行了定量供应的宣传教育。近两个月来，黄石市市民写信给粮食部门和当地报纸，揭发浪费粮食和囤积粮食的行为。市民们还推广了“生米蒸饭法”等好的做饭方法。预计全市自九月份全面实行市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法后，每月粮食销售量将比八月份下降二十万斤左右。
    新华社杭州二十九日电　浙江省杭州、宁波、温州、嘉兴、湖州、绍兴、金华七个主要城市，将在九月十六日以前实行粮食定量供应制度。
    杭州市和所属各区都已成立粮食定量供应办公室，并按照工业、商业、交通运输、财政、文教等二十四个系统成立了粮食定量供应工作小组。市粮食局为了使群众购粮便利，对全市粮食供应点进行了调整。各机关团体和工厂企业已普遍展开粮食定量供应的宣传工作。
    宁波市也已成立市、区粮食定量供应办公室。全市还训练了一千多个居民干部。温州市成立了粮食统销工作委员会，要求各机关、团体、企业等单位和居民区都必须由负责干部亲自领导这一工作。
    湖州、嘉兴、金华、绍兴等市核定人口的工作已结束，分等定量的工作也已初步完成。
