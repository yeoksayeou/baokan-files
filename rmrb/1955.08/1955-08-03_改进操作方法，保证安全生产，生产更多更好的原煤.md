To the Editor:

    The Five-Year Plan stipulates that by 1957, the national annual output of raw coal will reach 113 million tons; the annual output of raw coal at our Kailuan Coal Mine will reach 9.68 million tons. A glorious task is before us. We resolutely respond to the Party's call, work diligently, overcome difficulties, strive to increase production, and practice strict economy to ensure the completion of this task.

    Thanks to the earnest implementation of the policy of safe production, the workers of our No. 礃 mining area have achieved four years of safe production. Under the leadership of the Party, the production outlook of our mining area has undergone great changes in recent years: the new longwall mining method has replaced the barbaric and backward falling-coal mining method left over by the imperialists; fully mechanized coal cutting with coal cutting machines, coal falling with pneumatic picks and electric drills, and electric chute transportation have replaced backward hand-pick mining and manual cart transportation. The overall efficiency of our mining area has increased nearly two times compared with the beginning of 1953, and we produced 6,700 tons of coal more than the national plan in the first half of this year. What makes us especially proud is that since 1953, all the coal produced in our mining area has been supplied to Anshan Iron and Steel. In order to ensure that good steel can be made from good coal, we have done a lot of work to improve the quality of coal.

    However, we still have many shortcomings in our work: the production potential has not been fully realized, and work stoppages and waste still exist; the safety situation is not good, and the number of work-related injuries has increased compared with the first half of last year; there is still waste in the consumption of raw materials. All of these are contrary to the requirements of the Five-Year Plan. We are determined to overcome these shortcomings and will continue to carry out labor emulation in depth and do the following main tasks well: First, improve operation methods, implement the hand-picking system, solve the problem of gangue content in the coal seam, extract all the raw coal, and improve the coal quality a step further. Second, implement circulation charts, adhere to regular operations, and complete one cycle every day. Third, criticize complacency, establish democratic life meetings, improve various systems, and ensure safe production.

### 改进操作方法，保证安全生产，生产更多更好的原煤

    改进操作方法，保证安全生产，生产更多更好的原煤编辑同志：
    五年计划规定：到一九五七年，全国原煤的年产量将要达到一亿一千三百万吨；我们开滦煤矿原煤的年产量将要达到九百六十八万吨。一项光荣的任务摆在我们面前。我们坚决响应党的号召，兢兢业业，克服困难，努力增产，厉行节约，保证完成这项任务。
    我们礃的工人们，由于认真执行了安全生产方针，取得了安全生产四周年的成绩。在党的领导下，几年来我们礃的生产面貌有了很大的改变：新的长壁式采煤法代替了帝国主义者遗留下来的野蛮落后的落垛采煤法；全部机械化的割煤机采煤、风镐和电钻落煤、电溜子运输，代替了落后的手镐采煤和人力推车运输。我们礃的全员效率比一九五三年初提高了将近两倍，今年上半年比国家计划多产了六千七百吨煤。特别使我们感到光荣的，就是从一九五三年起，我们礃生产的煤炭全部供给鞍钢使用了。为了保证能够用好煤炼出好钢，我们在提高煤质上做了不少工作。
    但是，我们工作中缺点还是不少的：生产潜力没有充分发挥，窝工浪费仍然存在；安全情况不好，工伤数字比去年上半年增加了；原材料的消耗还有着浪费现象。所有这些，都是同五年计划的要求相违背的。我们决心克服这些缺点，并将继续深入开展劳动竞赛，做好以下几项主要工作：一，改进操作方法，执行手拣制度，解决煤层当中含矸石的问题，要把原煤全部采出来，把煤质再提高一步。二，实行循环图表，坚持正轨作业，每天走一个循环。三，批判自满情绪，建立民主生活会，健全各项制度，保证安全生产。	    唐家庄矿王阁亭礃（河北省模范生产单位）代表王阁亭		（尹桓年、王九旭记）
