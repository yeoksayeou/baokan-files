    Striving to Fulfill the First Five-Year Plan in All Aspects
    Working Hard at Drilling to Find More Oil Resources for the Motherland
    To the Editor:
    As the Second Session of the First National People's Congress is discussing the nation's First Five-Year Plan, all the members of a drilling team on the oil industrial front of our motherland would like to report our work to the people of the whole country through the newspaper.
    On April 28th of this year, while undertaking the drilling task of a certain well in the Baiyang River exploration area, we safely drilled 372.7 meters in twelve hours and forty-four minutes of pure drilling time, setting a national record for the highest daily footage, and were awarded the title of Advanced Drilling Team. In April, with a monthly drilling speed of more than 3,000 meters, we completed 310% of the monthly plan. We maintained this achievement, overfulfilling the state task for the first half of the year by 33% one month ahead of schedule, and ensured safe production, with the quality of the well fully meeting the standards.
    Our ability to successfully complete the state plan is the result of continuously overcoming difficulties. Our drilling team was established in 1952. Many of the drillers were transferred from the army and were completely unfamiliar with modern drilling rigs. At that time, our drilling team frequently had accidents, completing only 75% of the state plan in the first year of the First Five-Year Plan. However, the happy prospects of socialist industrialization inspired us to do a good job in drilling. We actively studied technology, strengthened the inspection of drill bits before they were lowered into the well, learned and implemented operating procedures, and strictly adhered to the shift change system. In order to ensure that everyone was aware of the daily work, team leader Wang Hualan discussed with everyone and established a "Daily Task and Technical Measures Posting System," eliminating the confusion of the past. Subsequently, we established charts such as safety comparisons between shifts, integrated performance converted into footage, and production indicator curves, launching a labor competition. In 1954, our drilling team's task increased by nearly double compared to 1953, but we completed 116% of the annual plan.
    In the Qilian Mountains or the Gobi Desert where we work, the temperature often drops to minus 30 or 40 degrees Celsius in winter. The mud in the drill pipe sprayed on people immediately freezes into ice, and touching the machine with a warm hand often tears off a layer of skin. In summer, the scorching sun makes it hard for people to breathe, the mud on the drill pipe is cracked by the sun, and chunks fall from high places whenever the motor vibrates. However, no matter how harsh the natural conditions are, we never leave the drilling rig, because this is our glorious post, and we must find more oil for the country's industrialization.
    We will never be complacent with our existing achievements. We know that the First Five-Year Plan requires us to strive to find more oil resources and expand the scale of oil industry construction. In order to fulfill this requirement of the motherland, in order to complete the glorious task given to us by the people, we are determined to dedicate all our strength, continuously overcome difficulties, and achieve greater success in drilling work.

### 为全部实现第一个五年计划而奋斗  努力做好钻井工作，为祖国寻找更多的石油资源

    为全部实现第一个五年计划而奋斗
    努力做好钻井工作，为祖国寻找更多的石油资源编辑同志：
    当第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议正在讨论祖国第一个五年计划的时候，我们祖国石油工业战线上的一个钻井队的全体人员，愿意通过报纸向全国人民汇报我们的工作情况。
    今年四月二十八日，我们在担任白扬河探区某号井的钻探任务时，以十二小时四十四分钟的纯钻进时间，安全钻进三百七十二点七公尺，创造全国日进尺最高纪录，得到了先进钻井队的称号。四月份，我们以三千多公尺的钻机月进速度，完成了全月计划的百分之三百一十。我们保持了这个成绩，提前一个月超额百分之三十三完成了上半年的国家任务，并且保证了安全生产，井的质量也完全符合标准。
    我们能够很好地完成国家计划，是不断克服困难的结果。我们钻井队在一九五二年成立，许多钻工是从部队上转业来的，对现代化的钻机完全是外行。那时候，我们钻井队经常出事故，在第一个五年计划的头一年只完成国家计划的百分之七十五。但是，社会主义工业化的幸福远景鼓舞着我们，做好钻井工作。我们积极学习技术，加强了钻头下井前的检查工作，学习并执行了操作规程，严格地遵守了交接班制度。为了使大家对每天的工作心中有数，队长王化兰和大家研究后，建立了“每日任务和技术措施挂牌制”，消除了过去的混乱现象。接着，我们又建立了各班的安全比较、综合成绩折合进尺和生产指示曲线等图表，展开了劳动竞赛。一九五四年，我们钻井队的任务比一九五三年增加了将近一倍，但是我们却完成了全年计划的百分之一百一十六。
    在我们工作的祁连山或戈壁滩上，冬天气温常常降到零下三、四十度，钻杆里的泥浆喷在人身上立刻就冻成冰块，热手抚摸在机器上常常会扯下一层皮来；夏天炎热的太阳晒得人喘不过气来，钻杆上的泥浆被太阳晒裂，马达一震动就一块块地从高处掉下来。但是，无论自然条件怎样恶劣，我们一刻也不离开钻机，因为这是我们的光荣岗位，我们要为祖国的工业化寻找出更多的石油来。
    我们决不为已有的成绩而自满。我们知道，第一个五年计划要求我们努力寻找更多的石油资源，扩大石油工业的建设规模。为了实现祖国的这个要求，为了完成人民给我们的光荣任务，我们决心献出自己的全部力量，不断地克服困难，在钻井工作中取得更大的成绩。
