Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 30th: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sōhyō) held a meeting of its Standing Committee of Directors in Tokyo on the 26th and 27th, and decided on a struggle plan to implement the worker movement guidelines passed at its sixth general meeting in July.

　　The meeting decided that the focus of the struggle in the second half of this year will be: demanding wage increases, opposing the implementation of corporate "rationalization" plans that lay off workers; opposing amendments to the Labor Standards Law that would worsen working conditions; opposing military bases, demanding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs, and defending the constitution; and organizing workers in small and medium-sized enterprises.

　　The plan also stipulates specific activities to implement the above-mentioned key points of the struggle. These include: establishing a joint wage struggle committee with the All Japan Trade Union Conference, the National Federation of Industrial Organizations, and neutral trade unions, and holding national conferences to demand wage increases; establishing a "Countermeasures Conference Against Amendments to the Labor Standards Law" and launching struggles in the form of strikes against amendments to the Labor Standards Law; conducting struggles against military bases together with farmers and fishermen, and promoting the movement to demand the prohibition of atomic weapons based on the resolutions of the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs; supporting the struggles of workers in small and medium-sized enterprises and helping them establish national trade union federations.

　　This struggle plan will be finalized by the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan's Board of Directors meeting on September 8th.
