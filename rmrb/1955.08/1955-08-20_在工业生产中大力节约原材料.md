    Many factories and mines in various regions, during the campaign to increase production and practice economy, have vigorously lowered the consumption quotas of raw materials or have fully utilized substandard materials, waste materials, and substitutes, saving a great deal of valuable raw and other materials and increasing much wealth for the country. The state-owned cotton textile factories under the Shanghai Textile Bureau, since launching the campaign to conserve cotton, have reduced the average cotton consumption per piece of yarn from 390.84 catties in the fourth quarter of last year to 387.4 catties in June of this year. After national labor model Li Chuanjiang improved the oil extraction method, each 100 catties of soybeans produced more than 2 catties of soybean oil than the general level. From January to May this year, the Fuxin Mining Bureau used low-value timber—fuel wood—as pit props, saving more than 17,000 cubic meters of good timber and reducing pit prop expenses by more than 474,000 yuan. According to calculations, if each piece of cotton yarn uses two catties less cotton under the condition of ensuring product quality, the country can increase production by at least 20,000 pieces of cotton yarn annually; if each 100 catties of oilseeds produces an average of one catty more oil, the country can increase production by at least 100 million catties of oil annually; and if 30 percent of fuel wood can be used to replace good timber as pit props under the condition of ensuring safe production, just the three coal mines of Fushun, Fuxin, and Benxi can save more than 4 million yuan in funds annually. From this, it can be seen how important it is to conserve raw materials in industrial production.
    During our country’s First Five-Year Plan period, approximately two-thirds of the funds used for industrial construction came from reducing the cost of industrial products, reducing transportation costs, and reducing the commodity circulation expenses of state-owned and cooperative commercial enterprises. To reduce the cost of industrial products, in addition to increasing labor productivity and reducing non-productive expenditures, the most important thing is to conserve raw materials. Raw materials are the main component of the cost of industrial products, and the less the expenditure on raw materials, the more the cost of industrial products is reduced. For example, in the cost of mechanical industrial products, metal raw material costs account for 56 percent. In the past, due to various reasons, the metal utilization rate of enterprises under the First Ministry of Machine Building was only 45 to 55 percent. If 3 to 5 percent of metal raw materials can be saved in production, the product cost can be reduced by 2.1 to 3.5 percent. Calculated on the basis of the annual products of enterprises under the First Ministry of Machine Building, the value of such savings would be equivalent to the value of 10,000 two-and-a-half-ton cutting machine tools.
    However, in recent years, although the consumption quotas of raw materials in various industrial enterprises have been gradually reduced, the phenomenon of waste of raw materials is still very serious; among similar enterprises, the level of raw material consumption also varies greatly. For example, in the first quarter of this year, the amount of pulp consumed per ton of glazed paper produced by state-owned paper mills varied by 107 kilograms. Tianjin Paper Mill and Yingkou Paper Mill both produce the same bleached reed pulp, but Tianjin Paper Mill uses 26 kilograms more sulfur and 113 kilograms more raw reeds per ton of pulp than Yingkou Paper Mill. For another example, in manufacturing cargo barges of the same specifications and models, the state-owned Jiangnan Shipyard uses 122 to 135 tons of steel plates per ship; the state-owned Hudong Shipyard uses 110 to 115 tons, while the Shanghai local state-owned shipyards and the shipyards under the Ministry of Transportation calculate that only 108 to 110 tons are required according to the design drawings. Similar situations exist in various industries and departments.
    The main reason for the serious waste of raw materials is that the leading personnel of many industrial enterprises do not have a sufficient understanding that the economical and rational use of raw materials is the main source of expanding socialist accumulation. Therefore, in enterprise management, they turn a blind eye to the phenomenon of wasting raw materials; some people even use more consumption of raw materials as an important means to ensure quality and output. The planned consumption quotas of raw materials in many industrial enterprises are estimated by technical personnel and management personnel. Some people are afraid that advanced quotas cannot be completed, so they deliberately estimate the planned quotas very conservatively. For example, in the raw material plan quota, the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory set the metal consumption of crankshaft blanks at 1,722 kilograms, but in fact, only 777 kilograms are needed. The Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant set the planned cutting rate of the casting of the rocker arm drilling machine at 35 percent, but in fact, only 21 percent is needed. Some enterprises do not even have estimated planned consumption quotas, which leads to even more waste. Although some industrial enterprises have formulated relatively advanced planned consumption quotas for raw materials, waste is still very serious due to the lack of a strict raw material management system. In order to effectively conserve raw materials, every industrial enterprise must formulate scientific raw material consumption quotas and strictly implement the storage, requisition, and recycling systems of raw materials. Only in this way can we strengthen the planning of raw material supply, control the raw materials of workshops, sections, and teams, and promote the masses of workers to use raw materials economically.
    Conserving raw materials is a long-term task. During the Five-Year Plan period, one of the difficulties in increasing the output of industrial products is the shortage of industrial raw materials. Therefore, we must continuously strive to conserve raw materials. With the improvement of production equipment, the improvement of workers' technical level and enterprise management level, the emergence of advanced experience and advanced operating methods, and the improvement of product design, the possibility of conserving raw materials is also increasing. Therefore, we are fully confident that not only now, but also in the future, we will be able to save more and more raw materials for the country. In small and medium-sized industrial enterprises, due to relatively simple equipment, low technical level, and low management level, there are more factors that cause waste of raw materials, so we should pay attention to conservation. Even in large-scale industrial enterprises with advanced equipment and high management and technical levels, we should also pay attention to conservation. The equipment of Soviet industrial enterprises is much better than ours, and the management and technical levels are also much higher than ours, but the Soviet Union still regards conserving raw materials as a major task, which is the best proof.
    Among the leading staff and management personnel of industrial enterprises, some people regard conserving raw materials as a crash campaign; others use the excuse that conservation is a long-term task and advocate "taking it slowly." These comrades first do not understand the significance of conservation, and secondly, they do not understand that the conservation of raw materials must be based on improving the management level and technical level of industrial enterprises. In order to catch up with the needs of the country, we must accelerate the improvement of our level, especially to quickly learn from the existing advanced enterprises. Therefore, the party organizations and administrative leaders of enterprises should continuously use the method of summarizing and promoting advanced experience to improve the level of backward enterprises and backward workers, so that they can catch up with the advanced level.
    Some leading staff of industrial enterprises put the conservation of raw materials in opposition to ensuring product quality and quantity, saying things like "output first, quality second, and conservation third." There is no doubt that we must practice economy under the condition of ensuring product quality. At the same time, conservation is by no means "shoddy workmanship," but rather reducing and eliminating waste in production management. Under the condition of ensuring product quality, if small pieces of material can be used, do not use large pieces of material; if substandard materials can be used, do not use good materials; use less where less can be used; and use substitutes where substitutes can be used. This is completely consistent with ensuring product quality and quantity.
    Now, we should no longer allow the indicators and methods of conserving raw materials to remain in offices and various cadre meetings for a long time. It is absolutely necessary to fully discuss conservation indicators and methods in offices and among cadres, but the people who directly implement the conservation plans, systems, and methods are, after all, the broad masses of workers. Only when the technical level of the broad masses of workers is improved, and they consciously implement various conservation systems and methods in production, can advanced conservation plans be realized. The fact that many factories have achieved certain results in conservation after organizing youth conservation teams and youth supervision posts proves this point. Therefore, the party organizations and administrative staff of every industrial enterprise must strengthen the political education of conserving raw materials among the workers, improve the workers' level of awareness, organize the workers to learn advanced experience, improve the workers' technical level, and at the same time organize and lead the workers to carry out labor competitions, and make the completion of the raw material conservation plan a part of the labor competition. Only in this way can we make the broad masses of workers consciously struggle to conserve raw materials.

### 在工业生产中大力节约原材料

    在工业生产中大力节约原材料
    各地许多工厂和矿山在增产节约运动中大力降低原材料的消耗定额，或充分利用次料、废料和代用品，节约了很多宝贵的原料和材料，为国家增加了许多财富。华东纺织管理局所属国营棉纺织厂，自从展开节约用棉以来，每件纱的平均用棉量，从去年第四季度的三百九十点八四市斤降低到今年六月份的三百八十七点四市斤。全国劳动模范李川江改进榨油操作法后，每百斤大豆比一般水平多出两斤多豆油。阜新矿务局今年一月到五月，以低值木材——薪炭木材做坑木，节省了一万七千多立方公尺的好材，少支出坑木费四十七万四千多元。根据推算，如果在保证产品质量的条件下每件棉纱少用两斤棉花，全国每年就可以至少增产两万件棉纱；每百斤油料平均多出一斤油，全国每年就可至少增产一亿多斤油；在保证安全生产的条件下，能用百分之三十的薪炭材代替好材做坑木，只以抚顺、阜新、本溪三个煤矿计算，全年就可节约四百多万元资金。由此可见，在工业生产中节约原材料是多么重要的一项工作。
    我国第一个五年计划期间工业建设所用的资金中，大约有三分之二是从降低工业产品成本、降低交通运输成本和国营、合作社营商业的商品流转费用中取得的。要降低工业产品的成本，除了提高劳动生产率、减少非生产开支以外，最重要的就是节约原材料。原材料是工业产品成本的主要构成部分，原材料的支出越少，工业产品的成本也就降低的越多。例如，在机械工业产品成本中，金属原料费占百分之五十六，过去，由于种种原因，第一机械工业部所属企业的金属利用率只有百分之四十五到五十五。如果在生产中能节约百分之三到百分之五的金属原料，产品成本就可降低百分之二点一到百分之三点五。以第一机械工业部所属企业的全年产品来计算，这样节约的价值就可以相当于一万台两吨半重的切削机床的价值。
    但是，在近几年来，各个工业企业的原材料消耗定额虽然是逐渐降低的，但是，原材料的浪费现象还很严重；在同类企业中，原材料消耗量的高低也相差悬殊。例如国营造纸工厂今年第一季度生产的有光纸，每吨所消耗的纸浆量高低相差一百零七公斤。天津造纸厂和营口造纸厂都生产同样的漂白苇浆，但天津造纸厂的每吨纸浆比营口造纸厂多用二十六公斤硫磺，一百一十三公斤原苇。又如制造同样规格、同样型号的货驳，国营江南造船厂每艘所用的钢板是一百二十二吨到一百三十五吨；国营沪东造船厂用一百一十吨到一百一十五吨，而上海地方国营造船厂和交通部所属造船厂根据设计图纸计算结果，只要一百零八吨到一百一十吨。类似这些情况，在各个行业和部门中都有。
    原材料浪费现象严重的主要原因，是许多工业企业的领导人员对节约地合理地使用原材料乃是扩大社会主义积累的主要泉源认识不足，所以在企业管理工作中，对浪费原材料的现象熟视无睹；有的人甚至以多消耗原材料来作为保证质量和产量的重要手段。许多工业企业的原材料计划消耗定额，都是由技术人员和管理人员估算出来的，有些人怕订了先进的定额不能完成，故意把计划定额估算得十分保守。例如，上海汽轮机厂在原材料计划定额里，把曲轴毛坯所消耗的金属订为一千七百二十二公斤，但实际上只需要七百七十七公斤。沈阳第二机床厂订的摇臂钻床铸件的计划切削率为百分之三十五，但实际上只需要百分之二十一。有些企业连估算的计划消耗定额也没有，那就更加浪费得多了。有些工业企业虽然制定了比较先进的原材料计划消耗定额，但由于缺乏严格的原材料管理制度，浪费现象也很严重。为了有效地节约原材料，每一个工业企业必须制定科学的原材料消耗定额，严格贯彻原材料的保管、领用、回收等制度。只有这样，才能加强原材料供应的计划性，控制车间、工段、小组的原材料，并推动职工群众节约地使用原材料。
    节约原材料是一个长期性的工作。在五年计划期间，增加工业品产量的一个困难是工业原料不足，因此，我们必须不断地努力节约原材料。而随着生产设备的改进，工人技术水平和企业管理水平的提高，先进经验、先进操作法的出现，以及产品设计的改进等等，节约原材料的可能性也越来越大。所以，我们完全有信心不但在现在，而且在将来能够为国家节约越来越多的原材料。在中、小型的工业企业中，由于设备比较简陋、技术水平和管理水平较低，造成浪费原材料的因素多一些，固然应该重视节约；就是在大型的、设备先进的、管理水平和技术水平较高的工业企业里，也应该重视节约。苏联工业企业的设备比我国的好得多，管理水平和技术水平比我国的也高得多，但苏联至今还把节约原材料作为主要的任务，这就是最好的证明。
    在工业企业的领导工作人员和管理人员中，有些人把节约原材料当作突击运动；有些人则借口节约是长期性的工作而主张“慢慢来”。这些同志首先是不了解节约的意义，其次也不了解原材料的节约必须建筑在提高工业企业的管理水平和技术水平的基础上。为了赶上国家的需要，我们必须加快地提高我们的水平，特别是要迅速地向现有的先进企业看齐。因此企业的党组织、行政领导工作人员应该不断地用总结和推广先进经验的方法来提高落后企业、落后工人的水平，使他们赶上先进的水平。
    有些工业企业的领导工作人员把节约原材料跟保证产品质量和数量对立起来，说什么“产量第一，质量第二，节约第三”这一类的话。必须在保证产品质量的条件下厉行节约，这是没有疑问的。同时，节约也决不是“偷工减料”，而是减少和消灭生产管理中的浪费，在保证产品质量的条件下，可以用小料零料的就不要用大料、整料；可以用次料的就不要用好料；可以少用的就不要多用；可以用代用品的就用代用品，这跟保证产品的质量和数量是完全一致的。
    现在，我们再也不应该容许节约原材料的指标和办法长久停留在科室里和各种干部会议上了。在科室和干部中充分讨论节约指标和办法是十分必要的，但是，直接执行节约计划、制度和办法的，毕竟是广大的职工群众。只有广大的职工群众的技术水平提高了，并在生产中自觉地贯彻各种节约的制度和办法，先进的节约计划才能实现。许多工厂组织青年节约队、青年监督岗以后，都在节约方面取得一定的成绩，就是这个道理。因此，每一个工业企业的党组织和行政工作人员，必须在职工中加强节约原材料的政治教育，提高职工的觉悟程度，组织职工学习先进经验，提高职工的技术水平；同时组织和领导职工开展劳动竞赛，把完成节约原材料计划作为劳动竞赛的一个内容。这样，才能使广大职工自觉地为节约原材料而奋斗。
