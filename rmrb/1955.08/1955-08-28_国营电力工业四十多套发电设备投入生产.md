　　Advancing on the Road of Socialism
　　Over Forty Sets of Power Generation Equipment in State-Owned Electric Power Industry Put into Production

　　By mid-August, more than forty sets of power generation equipment in power stations built by the state-owned electric power industry during the First Five-Year Plan period have been put into production successively. The newly added power generation capacity is equivalent to 56 percent of the total power generation capacity of the state-owned electric power industry nationwide at the end of 1952. Corresponding to these power generation equipments that have been put into production, high-voltage and low-voltage transmission lines with a total length of more than 1,800 kilometers have also been laid in various regions.

　　These completed power generation equipments and transmission lines have provided a large amount of power source for the development of existing industries and the construction of new industrial areas in various regions. In the original Northeast industrial base, several giant generators of the Fengman Hydroelectric Power Station and Fushun, Fuxin and other thermal power plants which are under reconstruction have begun to generate electricity, which has increased the power supply to industrial cities such as Anshan and Benxi by several times. Zhengzhou, which is developing into a major light industrial city in the Central South region, Taiyuan and Tianjin, the major industrial cities in North China, and Xi'an, Lanzhou, Urumqi and other places in the Northwest region, have also seen many newly built and expanded power stations strongly support local industrial construction.

　　The completion of these power stations and transmission lines has also accumulated valuable experience for the construction of larger-scale electric power industrial enterprises that are under construction and will be constructed. Since Chongqing Power Plant was put into production, it has trained many electrical workers and cadres who can master modern technology and production management methods for other newly built power plants.

　　在社会主义的道路上前进
　　国营电力工业四十多套发电设备投入生产
　　到八月中旬止，国营电力工业在第一个五年计划期间建设的电站，已有四十多套发电设备先后投入了生产。新增加的发电设备能力相当于一九五二年底全国国营电力工业发电设备能力的百分之五十六。和这些已投入生产的发电设备相适应，各地还铺设了全长一千八百多公里的高压和低压的输电线路。
　　这些已建成的发电设备和输电线，为各地区现有工业的发展和新工业区的建设提供了大量的动力来源。在原有的东北工业基地，正在改建中的丰满水力发电站和抚顺、阜新等火力发电厂的几台巨型的发电机已开始发电，这使得供应鞍山和本溪等工业城市的电力增加了好几倍。正在发展成为中南地区主要轻工业城市的郑州，华北地区的主要工业城市太原、天津，以及西北地区的西安、兰州、乌鲁木齐等地，新建和扩建的很多发电站，也都有力地支援了当地的工业建设。
　　这些电站和输电线的建成，还为正在建设和即将建设的更大规模的电力工业企业积累了宝贵的经验。重庆电力厂投入生产以来，已为其他新建电厂培养了许多能掌握现代技术和生产管理方法的电业工人和干部。（据新华社讯）
