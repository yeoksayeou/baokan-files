Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech
Ambassador, Ladies and Gentlemen:

　　On behalf of the government and people of the People’s Republic of China, I extend my warm congratulations on the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Indonesia.

　　The government and people of Indonesia have waged arduous struggles for national independence, to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and have made important efforts and contributions to easing international tensions and maintaining peace in Asia and the world. Indonesia, together with the other four Colombo countries, initiated and convened the Asian-African Conference. The achievements of this conference are having a profound and favorable impact on peace internationally, especially among Asian and African countries.

　　As the Ambassador said, in recent years, the traditional and profound friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples has been further developed based on the principles of peaceful coexistence. The mutual visits of the Premiers of the two countries and the joint communiqué issued, the treaty signed between the two countries on the issue of dual nationality, the mutual visits of cultural delegations of the two countries, and the increasing development of trade relations all mark the growing closeness of relations between the two countries. I firmly believe that our two countries can continue to develop and consolidate the friendship between China and Indonesia in the future, based on the common aspirations affirmed by the Asian-African Conference and the declaration adopted to promote world peace and cooperation, and based on the increasingly strong desire of the people of both countries to strengthen friendly and cooperative relations. The Chinese government and people highly cherish the development and consolidation of this friendly relationship. Because this not only conforms to the wishes and interests of the people of our two countries, but also helps to maintain peace in Asia and the world.

　　I propose:

　　To the friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia,

　　To peace in Asia and the world,

　　To the prosperity of the Republic of Indonesia and the happiness of its people,

　　To the health of today's host, Ambassador Mononutu, and all the Indonesian friends present!

    周恩来总理的讲话大使先生、女士们和先生们：
    我谨代表中华人民共和国政府和人民热烈地祝贺印度尼西亚共和国国庆十周年纪念。
    印度尼西亚政府和人民为了争取民族独立，为了维护国家主权和领土完整，曾经进行过艰苦的斗争，并且为了和缓国际紧张局势和维护亚洲和世界的和平作过重要的努力和贡献。印度尼西亚曾经同其他四个科伦坡国家共同发起和召开了亚非会议。这个会议的成就，正在国际上、特别是在亚非各国中间发生有利于和平的深远的影响。
    正如大使先生所说的，近年来，中国人民和印度尼西亚人民传统的深厚友谊根据和平共处的原则，获得了进一步的发展。两国总理的互相访问和共同发表的联合声明，两国签订的关于双重国籍问题的条约，两国文化代表团的互相访问和贸易关系的日益发展，都标志着两国关系的日益密切。我深信，我们两国今后能够根据亚非会议所肯定的共同愿望和所通过的促进世界和平和合作的宣言，并根据两国人民对加强两国友好合作关系的日益强烈的愿望，继续发展和巩固中国和印度尼西亚之间的友谊。中国政府和人民非常珍视这种友好关系的发展和巩固。因为这不仅符合我们两国人民的愿望和利益，而且也有助于维护亚洲和世界的和平。
    我建议：
    为中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国的友谊，
    为亚洲和世界的和平，
    为印度尼西亚共和国的繁荣和人民的幸福，
    为今天的宴会主人莫诺努图大使和到会的各位印度尼西亚朋友们的健康干杯！
