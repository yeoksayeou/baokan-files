    Steel and Wood Discarded Everywhere

    Editor:

    In the freight yard and around many workshops of the Qiqihar Railway Vehicle Manufacturing Factory, steel materials are discarded everywhere. Some have been corroded by long-term wind and rain, some have been buried by sand, and some have been used to fill large pits. Among these things, there are also some finished and semi-finished products. Around the lumber workshop, piles of mixed good and bad wood have accumulated into five or six large mountains, blocking the road. In the ditches behind the workshop, processed timber lies horizontally and vertically, being trampled on by people and vehicles, with no one caring. The firewood sold by this factory, when it goes to private woodworking businesses, turns into good material. People who visited the factory once said:

  “The things thrown away on the ground in this factory are worth more than the total land income of several districts in the countryside!”

    Some employees, unable to bear it, have suggested to the leadership to clean up the discarded scrap steel materials. However, the relevant leading staff said that "picking up scrap iron is not worth the labor cost," and these suggestions have not been adopted for a long time.

    After the launch of the comprehensive savings campaign, the employees took the initiative to organize a savings team to pick up scrap steel and waste materials. In just a few days, a lot of things have been dug up, some of which weigh five or six hundred catties apiece.

    The leading staff of this factory should take the savings work seriously. Not even a small screw of the country's wealth should be allowed to be wasted in vain.

### 遍地丢弃着钢铁木材

    遍地丢弃着钢铁木材编辑同志：
    齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造工厂的货车场和很多车间的周围，遍地丢弃着钢铁器材。有的经过长期风吹雨淋而腐蚀了，有的已被砂土埋没了，有的已经垫进了大坑。这些东西里边，还有一部分是成品和半成品。在制材车间周围，好坏混杂的木材堆积成五、六座大山，把道路也堵死了。在车间后边的沟里沟外，制成材横躺竖卧着，任凭人踩车轧，无人过问。这个厂卖出去的劈柴，转到私人木工业手里，都变成了好材料。来工厂参观的人曾这样说：
  “这个工厂地上扔的东西，比农村几个区的土地总收入要大得多！”
    有的职工看不过去，曾向领导方面建议清理扔掉的废钢铁器材。可是有关领导工作人员说是“拣碎铁不够工钱”，长期没有采纳这些建议。
    这次开展全面节约的工作以后，职工们主动组织了节约队，拣碎钢铁和废器材。几天来挖出的东西很多，其中有些废器材一件就有五、六百斤重。
    这个工厂的领导工作人员应该认真对待节约工作。国家的财富，那怕是一个小螺丝钉也不能叫它白白浪费掉。杨占山
