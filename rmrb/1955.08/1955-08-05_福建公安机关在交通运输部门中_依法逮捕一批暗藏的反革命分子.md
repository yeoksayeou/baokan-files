    Fujian Public Security Organs Arrested a Group of Hidden Counter-Revolutionaries in the Transportation Department According to Law
    With the assistance of the broad masses of workers and staff, public security organs in various parts of Fujian Province have, according to law, arrested a number of counter-revolutionaries who had escaped the net and were hiding in the transportation departments.
    Among these arrested criminals, some disguised themselves as activists and played two-faced tricks, actively engaging in counter-revolutionary activities after seizing leadership positions. For example, the fugitive counter-revolutionary Yang Rizhong infiltrated the Nanping Work Zone Highway Transportation Trade Union and became its chairman. He lied to administrative leaders about achievements, gained their trust, and recruited some people who had served as puppet army officers and ruffians into the trade union, forming a small clique to control the trade union. They misappropriated workers' welfare funds for squandering and did not provide subsidies to workers in need. They also used trade union funds to buy a radio specifically to listen to Taiwan broadcasts and spread rumors. Wu Fengnian, chairman of the Jianyang Work Zone Highway Transportation Trade Union, was found to have a bloody history as a counter-revolutionary. He had participated in the "Homecoming Corps" and committed the crimes of reckoning accounts in reverse and killing peasants.
    These counter-revolutionaries infiltrated our transportation departments during worker recruitment. They changed their names, concealed their histories, and made clever disguises. For example, Cai Gaochao, a worker at the Shunchang County highway road maintenance team, had changed his name to Cai Changwen, Cai Shichang, and Cai Hongmao, and later disguised himself as Lu Wenlong to infiltrate the road maintenance team. When Zhejiang was liberated, Cai fled to Taiwan with the Chiang Kai-shek troops, and at the end of 1949, he sneaked back into the mainland, joining the "Anti-Communist Patriotic Salvation Army Fifth Column Direct Second Brigade" in Zhejiang, serving as a quartermaster. After being arrested by us, he escaped and fled to Fujian. After infiltrating the road maintenance team, he was passive and sabotaged work, and constantly created internal disputes. The counter-revolutionary elements Wang Rongqing and Sun Wantong, who were lurking in the Nanping maintenance depot, also carried out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. Criminal Wang Rongqing frequently plotted to create accidents. In February of this year, when the vehicles driven by two provincial labor models entered the depot, he did not grease the vehicle parts or add black oil, attempting to cause the vehicles to malfunction and cause accidents. Criminal Sun Wantong had murdered four people. In addition, the counter-revolutionary elements Tang Chengpeng and Xie Guomin, who were lurking in the Chong'an Work Zone, frequently spread rumors and slandered the Communist Party and the People's Government.
    When reporting and exposing this group of lurking counter-revolutionaries who had escaped the net, the workers and staff in various places unanimously demanded that the government severely punish them according to law.

    福建公安机关在交通运输部门中
    依法逮捕一批暗藏的反革命分子
    福建省各地公安机关在广大职工群众协助下，依法逮捕了一批潜藏在交通运输部门的漏网的反革命分子。
    这些被逮捕的罪犯中，有的伪装积极，玩弄两面派手法，在窃据领导职位后积极进行反革命活动。如逃亡反革命分子杨日忠混入南平工区公路运输工会当了主席，在行政领导同志面前谎报成绩，骗取信任，并网罗一部分曾经当过伪军官、兵痞而混入工会的人，组成小集团把持工会，他们擅自把工人福利费拿来挥霍，而对有困难的工人不给补助，他们还用工会费买了一架收音机，专门偷听台湾广播，制造谣言。建阳工区公路运输工会主席吴凤年，经查明历史上是个有血债的反革命分子，曾参加过还乡团，进行过倒算和杀害农民的罪恶活动。
    这些反革命分子是乘我交通运输部门招募工人时混进来的，他们化名改姓，隐瞒历史，作了巧妙的伪装。如在顺昌县公路道班当工人的蔡犯高潮，曾改名蔡昌文、蔡十昌、蔡宏茂，后又化名为卢文龙混入道班。在浙江临解放时，蔡犯曾随蒋贼军逃至台湾，一九四九年底又潜入大陆，在浙江加入“反共忠义救国军第五纵队直属二大队”任军需，被我逮捕后逃跑到福建。他混入道班后消极怠工，不时制造内部纠纷。潜伏在南平保养场的反革命分子王荣庆、孙万通，也进行了反革命破坏活动。王犯荣庆经常蓄谋制造事故，今年二月，两位省劳动模范驾驶的车子进场，他不给车子的机件打黄油，也不加黑油，企图使车子失灵造成事故；孙犯万通曾谋害过四条人命。此外，潜藏在崇安工区的反革命分子唐程鹏、谢国民，经常制造谣言，诬蔑共产党和人民政府。
    各地职工在检举揭发这批潜藏的漏网的反革命分子时，一致要求政府依法严厉惩办他们。
