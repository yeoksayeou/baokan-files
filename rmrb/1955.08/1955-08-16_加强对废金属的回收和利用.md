Strengthen the Recycling and Utilization of Scrap Metal
Director of the Supply Bureau Office, First Ministry of Machine Building, Zhang Dadian

The machine industry consumes a large amount of scrap metal in production, accounting for about 25% or more of the total consumption of metal materials. Therefore, ensuring the supply of scrap metal plays an important role in completing the machine industry's production plan, especially the production plans for smelting and casting in the machine industry.

The machine industry also generates a large amount of scrap metal during metal processing. If this scrap metal can be recycled and utilized, it can not only ensure the supply of scrap metal and save a large amount of metal raw materials, solving the current difficulty of insufficient metal raw material supply in our country, but also directly reduce product costs.

In addition to recycling the large amount of scrap metal generated by the machine industry itself during processing, collecting discarded metal products scattered everywhere is also an important source of scrap metal.

When recycling and utilizing scrap metal, attention should also be paid to saving and utilizing non-ferrous scrap metal. Because our country's non-ferrous metal resources have not yet been developed on a large scale, many non-ferrous metal raw materials still need to be imported from abroad, and the value of non-ferrous metals is generally more expensive, so saving and utilizing non-ferrous scrap metal is even more important.

With the continuous development of production, the consumption of scrap metal and the amount of scrap metal generated during metal processing in the machine industry will increase year by year. Therefore, how to recycle and collect scrap metal, and adopt various technical and organizational measures to fully utilize it, is a regular task of great economic significance for all enterprises and units in the machine industry.

In 1954, the First Ministry of Machine Building recovered waste steel from the production process, which met 42.6% of the production needs. The waste steel collected from various places accounted for more than half of the waste steel recovered from production. In 1955, the state required that the recovery of waste steel should be increased to 53.5%, and required enterprises to collect 28,000 tons of waste steel and 6,500 tons of waste pig iron. This task is very arduous.

Recently, we inspected the recycling and collection of scrap metal in 26 enterprises in Shanghai and Shenyang, and found that many enterprises have made remarkable achievements.

Many enterprises have collected a large amount of scrap metal. From July last year to March this year, the employees of Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant excavated 4,804 tons of waste steel, 2 tons of manganese, and 16.5 tons of waste copper from underground. The security team of Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant organized the security team to excavate more than 200 tons of waste steel in their spare time. The Youth Thrift Team of Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant collected more than 30 tons of waste steel in just five days.

Many enterprises have begun to pay attention to saving non-ferrous scrap metal. The Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant extracted more than 3,200 kilograms of copper slag from furnace ash in one month, and after refining, it was remelted and used to cast copper parts. They also extracted more than 3,100 kilograms of zinc ingots from zinc slag, saving 10,000 yuan in funds. The Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant established an organization for saving copper, refining the recovered miscellaneous copper and copper powder into copper ingots with a purity of 97.5%, and then re-smelting them for use. In the first quarter of this year, Shanghai Huatong Switch Factory directly put 10% to 30% of copper powder into the furnace, saving 850 kilograms of brass. Shanghai Zhonghua Shipyard used 14.17 tons of copper powder to replace 12.5 tons of refined copper, saving more than 20,000 yuan in funds. Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and used aluminum castings to replace copper castings, which can save 45 tons of copper material throughout the year and reduce costs by 21,000 yuan.

Among scrap metal, not only large pieces of scrap metal have great utilization value, but also scrap metal shavings have great utilization value. At present, the waste steel and iron that we can recover and collect can only meet 69.2% of the production needs. The remaining 30.8% must be solved by using waste steel shavings. This year, many enterprises have learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and directly put waste steel shavings into the furnace to melt into steel castings, and have achieved results. For example, Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant and Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Plant used waste steel shavings to melt iron castings, and the ratio of waste steel shavings to waste steel has reached 5% to 8%. Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant used 340 tons of steel shavings in the first half of the year, and it is expected that the proportion of doping can be increased to 14% in the second half of the year. The proportion of steel shavings used in the electric furnace steelmaking of Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant has increased from 16.25% to 25% in 1954 to 26.7% to 39.57% in 1955. The experience of these enterprises proves that using waste steel shavings as furnace materials for electric furnaces, open hearth furnaces, and cupola furnaces, and mixing an appropriate amount of steel shavings to melt steel castings does not affect the quality of the products. Nanjing Machine Tool Plant mixes 12% of steel shavings to melt secondary cast iron, and can reach the standard of first-class cast iron without external inoculation treatment. It can be used to replace high-grade cast iron to manufacture main parts, bed surfaces, gearboxes, etc., all of which meet technical requirements. If the proportion of steel shavings used in all our electric furnaces can reach 25%, we can save more than 22,000 tons of waste steel and save more than 1.32 million yuan in funds throughout the year; if we can widely use steel shavings to melt iron castings, most enterprises can use the steel shavings generated in their own metal processing to meet the needs of their own enterprises. Not only can they not apply to the state for waste steel, but also reduce the cost of each ton of product by more than 20 yuan. In open hearth steelmaking, a large amount of steel shavings can be used because the proportion of waste steel used can reach 70%. In addition, the steel slag of open hearth steelmaking generally contains about 15% to 30% of steel, and can also be used to replace waste steel. Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant can produce more than 5,000 tons of steel slag every year, and there were more than 40,000 tons in the past. If it is crushed and utilized, it can replace more than 8,000 to 10,000 tons of waste steel.

However, we also found that some enterprises are indifferent to the recycling and collection of scrap metal, and have not completed the first quarter's scrap metal recycling and collection plan, and even caused the loss and waste of scrap metal. For example, Shanghai Turbine Plant and Shanghai Hudong Shipyard actually used steel shavings to pave the ground; a large number of steel shavings were thrown into water pits, and have corroded and deteriorated, losing their utilization value. Fushun Heavy Machinery Plant piled the waste steel left over from the enemy and puppet period in a water pit several feet deep, and has not been used until now, and has been severely corroded; there are a lot of waste steel mixed in the mud and piled in the earthen pits on the two-mile-long square along the railway; many steel rails are abandoned in front of the riveting and welding workshop; the road to the canteen is simply paved with steel plates. Such arbitrary loss and waste of state assets is simply intolerable. In order to do a good job in the recycling and collection of scrap metal, we must first launch a struggle against this behavior.

To do a good job in the recycling and collection of scrap metal, and to ensure that the recycled and collected scrap metal is well utilized, it is also necessary to strengthen the planning of scrap metal recycling. Each production enterprise should accurately calculate the consumption and the amount that should be recycled based on the amount of metal required by the enterprise, the metal work situation, and the proportion of possible waste products, and compile a scrap metal recycling plan and balance sheet. All possible scrap metal should be included in the demand plan for balance, and those that cannot be utilized by the enterprise should also be included in the plan and reported to the state for distribution. Once the scrap metal recycling plan is approved by the state, it must be conscientiously implemented. If there is a surplus or shortage in the process of implementation, an adjustment plan should be compiled quarterly for supplementation or correction. Only by strengthening planning can the scrap metal recycling work be included in the national plan.

Recycling scrap metal is a mass work, and the strength of the masses must be organized to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. The planned targets for scrap metal recycling must be conveyed to each production workshop. Different recycling tasks should be specified for different workshops, a strict recycling system should be established, and the recycling quantity should be calculated according to the material issuance quota. The scrap metal collection work should also be divided into regional scopes, collection figures should be specified, and mass organizations for saving metal should be established.

To do a good job in the recycling and collection of scrap metal, it is also necessary to do a good job in various preparations. If the scrap metal has severe rust, a large amount of oil, or too much cotton waste, it will cause the melted product to contain harmful elements and unnecessary impurities, affecting the mechanical properties and quality of the product. Therefore, each enterprise must set up various technical devices for recycling waste materials in the workshop to minimize the loss of waste materials; the recovered material heads and material edges should be stored and kept separately according to the type and steel grade of the metal. Waste products and waste parts generated in the processing process should also be classified and collected into the warehouse, so that they can be used to manufacture other parts. In order to make more economical use of the remaining materials cut, each region should conduct detailed surveys and statistics on the supply of scrap metal, and organize enterprises to establish a mutual adjustment relationship, so that all possible scrap metal can play its greatest role. In addition, the recycled steel shavings should be stored in the material shed to prevent corrosion; the steel shavings should also be processed and sorted before being put into the furnace, and the scattered steel shavings should be pressed and packaged to increase the melting capacity. Pig iron shavings are an important raw material for manufacturing chemical dyes, and enterprises should also properly store them so that they can be supplied to the chemical industry in a timely manner.

    加强对废金属的回收和利用
    第一机械工业部供应局办公室主任  张大巅
    机械工业生产需要消耗大量的废金属，它的消耗量约占金属材料消耗总量的百分之二十五以上。因此，保证废金属的供应，对于完成机械工业生产计划，特别是对于完成机械工业中冶炼和铸造的生产计划，有重要的作用。
    机械工业在金属加工过程中又产生大量废金属。这些废金属如果能够回收利用，不仅可以保证废金属的供应，节约大批金属原材料，解决我国目前金属原材料供应不足的困难，而且可以直接降低产品成本。
    除了回收机械工业本身在加工过程中产生的大量废金属以外，搜集散失在各处的失去使用价值的金属制成品，也是废金属的一个重要来源。
    在回收和利用废金属时，还要注意节约和利用有色废金属。因为目前我国有色金属资源还没有大量开发，不少有色金属原材料还需要从国外进口，而且有色金属的价值又大都较贵，所以节约和利用有色废金属更为重要。
    随着生产的不断发展，在机械工业中，废金属的消耗量和在金属加工过程中产生的废金属是会逐年增加的。因此，如何回收和搜集废金属，并采用各种技术组织措施加以充分利用，是机械工业各企业单位一项具有重大经济意义的经常性的工作。
    第一机械工业部一九五四年从生产过程中回收的废钢，曾满足了生产需要量的百分之四十二点六，搜集起来的散失在各处的废钢，占从生产中回收废钢的一半以上。一九五五年，国家要求废钢的回收量要提高到百分之五十三点五，要求各企业搜集废钢二万八千吨，搜集废生铁六千五百吨。这个任务是很繁重的。
    最近，我们检查了上海和沈阳两地二十六个企业回收和搜集废金属的情况，发现不少企业已做出了显著的成绩。
    有很多企业搜集了大量的废金属。大连机车车辆制造厂的职工，从去年七月到今年三月，从地下挖掘出四千八百零四吨废钢，两吨锰和十六吨半废铜。沈阳第二机床厂组织警卫队利用业余时间挖掘出二百多吨废钢，太原矿山机器厂的青年节约队，仅五天就收集了三十多吨废钢。
    有不少企业开始注意了节约有色废金属。四方机车车辆制造厂一个月中就从炉灰中淘出了三千二百多公斤铜渣，经过提炼后，重新熔铸铜件使用了。他们还从锌渣中提炼出三千一百多公斤锌块，节约资金达一万元。太原矿山机器厂成立了节约用铜的组织，将回收的杂铜和铜沫提炼成纯度达百分之九十七点五的铜锭，再重新投炉使用。上海华通开关厂今年第一季度利用百分之十到三十的铜沫直接投炉，节约了八百五十公斤黄铜。上海中华造船厂用十四点一七吨铜沫代替了十二点五吨精铜，节约资金两万多元。上海电机厂学习苏联先进经验，利用铝铸件代替铜铸件，全年可节约铜料四十五吨，并可降低成本两万一千元。
    在废金属中，不仅成块的废金属利用价值很大，就是废金属屑的利用价值也很大。目前我们可能回收和搜集起来的废钢铁只能满足生产需用量的百分之六十九点二，其余的百分之三十点八，必须设法利用废钢屑，才能解决问题。今年有不少企业学习苏联先进经验，利用废钢铁屑直接投炉熔制成钢铁铸件，获得了成绩。如太原矿山机器厂和齐齐哈尔第一机床厂利用废钢屑熔制铁铸件，和废钢的配料比例已达到百分之五到百分之八。齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂上半年利用了钢屑三百四十吨，下半年预计可以把掺用比例提高到百分之十四。四方机车车辆制造厂电炉炼钢掺用的钢屑比例，已从一九五四年的百分之十六点二五到二十五，提高到一九五五年的百分之二十六点七到三十九点五七。这些企业的经验证明，用废钢屑作为电炉、马丁炉以及冲天炉的炉料，掺用适量的钢屑熔制钢铁铸件，并不影响产品的质量。南京机床厂掺用百分之十二的钢屑熔制二级铸铁，不经炉外孕育处理，就可以达到一级铸铁的标准，用来代替高级铸铁制造主要部件、床面、齿轮箱等，都符合技术要求。如果我们所有的电炉钢屑的掺用比例都能达到百分之二十五，全年就可节约废钢二万二千多吨，并可节约资金一百三十二万多元；如能广泛利用钢屑熔制铁铸件，大部分企业都可以利用自己在金属加工过程中产生的钢屑满足本企业的需要，不仅可以不向国家申请废钢，而且每吨产品还可以降低成本二十元以上。在平炉炼钢中，由于掺用废钢可达到百分之七十，更可以大量利用钢屑了。此外，平炉炼钢的钢渣一般含钢量约达百分之十五到百分之三十，也可以代替废钢使用。沈阳重型机器厂每年可产生五千吨以上的钢渣，过去还存有四万多吨，如果破碎利用，就可以代替八千到一万吨以上的废钢。
    但是，我们也发现有部分企业对于废金属回收和搜集工作漠不关心，没有完成第一季的废金属回收和搜集计划，甚至造成废金属的损失和浪费。如上海汽轮机厂和上海沪东造船厂竟用钢屑铺地；大批钢屑被扔在水坑里，已腐锈变质，失去利用价值。抚顺重型机器厂把敌伪时期遗留下来的废钢堆放在几丈深的水坑里，直到现在还没有利用，已腐锈得极严重；铁路沿线二里长的广场上，有不少废钢混在泥土里和堆在土坑里；铆焊车间前边弃置很多钢轨；通往食堂的路简直是用钢板铺成的。这种任意损失和浪费国家资财的行为，简直令人不能容忍。为了做好回收和搜集废金属的工作，我们首先要向这种行为展开斗争。
    要把废金属回收和搜集工作做好，使回收和搜集的废金属得到很好利用，还必须加强废金属回收的计划性。各生产企业应根据本企业金属需用的数量，利用金属工作的情况，结合可能产生废品的比例，精确地计算出废金属的耗损量和应回收的数量，编制出废金属回收计划和平衡表。凡可能利用的废金属都应该列入需用计划进行平衡，本企业不能利用的也列入计划报请国家分配。废金属回收计划一经国家批准，必须认真贯彻执行，在执行过程中如发生多余和不足，应按季编制调整计划进行补充或修正。只有加强计划性，才能使废金属回收工作纳入国家计划轨道。
    回收废金属是一项群众性的工作，必须把群众的力量组织起来，充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性。废金属回收的计划指标，必须下达到各个生产车间。要按照不同的车间规定不同的回收任务，建立严格的回收制度，根据发料限额，核算回收数量。废金属的搜集工作也应划分区域范围，规定搜集数字，成立节约金属的群众组织。
    要做好废金属回收和搜集工作，还必须做好各种准备工作。如果废金属中铁锈严重、油分大或回丝过多，就会使熔制的产品中含有有害元素和不必要的杂质，影响产品的机械性能和质量。因此，各企业必须在车间内设置回收废料的各种技术装置，以尽量减少废料的损失；收回的料头料边，要按金属的种类、钢号分别存放和保管，在加工过程中产生的废品和废件，也应分类收缴入库，以便用来制造其他零件。为了使切割的余料得到更经济的利用，各地区对废金属供应都应进行详细的调查和统计，组织各企业建立起相互调剂的关系，使一切可能利用的废金属，都能发挥它最大的作用。另外，回收的钢屑要保管在料棚内以防腐锈；钢屑在投炉前还要注意加工和整理，将散碎的钢屑进行压结和包装，以便提高熔量。生铁屑是制造化学染料的重要原料，各企业也应妥善保管，以便及时供应化学工业需要。
