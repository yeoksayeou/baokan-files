　　The Green and Shady Tianjia Village
　　By our reporter Kang Weizhong
    Fifteen kilometers west of Tianshui City in Gansu Province, nestled among layers of overlapping hills, one can see a lush and picturesque mountain village – Tianjia Village. This village is the focal point for Tianshui County's soil and water conservation efforts. The village covers a total land area of 4,560 mu, including both mountainous terrain and plains. It is home to 180 households. The trees planted around the village have grown thick and dense, providing ample shade, and the barren hills and bare slopes of the past have been significantly transformed.

    Tianjia Village is located on the southern bank of the Jie River, a tributary of the Wei River, within the Loess Plateau gully region. More than a dozen large and small gullies cascade down from the mountains. In the past, after heavy summer rains, raging torrents would rush down, eroding the farmland on both sides. This not only reduced the area of arable land but also damaged the fertility of the soil. Grain production steadily declined, and the lives of the farmers were extremely impoverished.

    After liberation, the Party and the government led the farmers of Tianjia Village in carrying out soil and water conservation work. Starting in 1952, Tianshui County designated it as the county's key village, strengthened leadership, helped the masses solve the problem of seedlings, and sent technicians to the countryside to assist. By the spring of this year, the village had planted a total of more than 240,000 trees (totaling more than 700 mu), a portion of which, including black locust, elm, and willow trees, have grown into forests and have already begun to play a role in conserving soil and water and protecting slopes and reinforcing gullies. At the same time, field engineering and gully management work were carried out; now, the village has built 700 mu of field ridges, dug 350 mu of terraces, and planted 150 mu of sweet clover. In addition, projects such as building dams, constructing check dams, digging water storage ponds, and filling sinkholes have been undertaken. This has stemmed the mountain floods, stored rainwater, retained soil moisture, and increased the average grain yield per mu from 321 jin in 1952 to 371 jin in 1954. Because of afforestation, not only has grain production increased, but also the problems of fuel, fertilizer, and feed for the masses have been solved.

    The development of soil and water conservation work in Tianjia Village has also played a promoting role in the surrounding villages. At present, the Tianshui Special District is promoting this experience throughout the entire special district and has organized many staff members and model laborers to visit and learn. Some nearby villages have also started soil and water conservation work based on this experience.

　　绿树成荫的田家庄
　　本报记者　康伟中
    从甘肃省天水市西行十五公里，在层层叠叠的山坳里，可以看到一个绿树葱茏、风景秀丽的山村——田家庄。这个村是天水县推广水土保持工作的重点村。全村土地面积有四千五百六十亩，有山地也有平川。这个村住着一百八十户人家。村的周围种植的树木已经茂密如林，绿树成荫，过去那种荒山童坡的面貌已经大大改观了。
    田家庄位于渭河水系的耤河南岸，属于黄土丘陵沟壑区，这里从山上奔泻下来的十多条大小河沟，过去每逢夏季暴雨过后，汹涌的山洪滚滚而下，冲刷两岸的农田，这不仅减少了耕地面积，且破坏了土地的肥力。粮食产量日益下降，农民生活极端贫苦。
    解放后，党和政府领导田家庄农民开展水土保持工作，从一九五二年开始，天水县把它作为全县的重点村，加强了领导，帮助群众解决树苗问题，并派技术人员下乡协助。到今年春天，全村植树总数达二十四万多株（合七百多亩），其中一部分洋槐、榆和柳树已经长大成林，并已起到了保持水土和护坡固沟的作用。同时还进行了田间工程和沟壑治理工作；现在，全村共培地埂七百亩，挖地坎沟三百五十多亩，种草木樨一百五十多亩。此外，还进行打坝堰、筑谷坊、挖涝池、填陷穴等工程。这就拦阻了山洪，蓄积了雨水，保住了地墒，每亩平均产粮从一九五二年三百二十一斤提高到一九五四年三百七十一斤。由于植树造林，不仅增加了粮食产量，而且解决了群众的燃料、肥料和饲料的问题。
    田家庄水土保持工作的开展，对周围村庄也起了推动作用。目前，天水专区正把这一经验推广到全专区，曾组织了许多工作人员和劳动模范相继参观和学习。附近有些村庄还根据这一经验，开展起水土保持工作。
