In accordance with the central government's instruction to launch a comprehensive savings and anti-waste campaign, the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee approved the "Savings Plan for Provincial-Level Agencies" on July 13th and notified local People's Committees to formulate practical savings methods based on their own actual conditions and earnestly implement them.

The "Savings Plan for Provincial-Level Agencies" in Shanxi Province stipulates that strict savings must be made in the public expenditure of agencies. Regarding meeting expenses, the plan stipulates that for meetings with more than 100 participants, miscellaneous expenses will be reduced by 20% from the original prescribed standards; for meetings with fewer than 100 participants, expenses will be reduced by 10%; small-scale reporting meetings and symposiums will not be funded. All meetings in the future will not include meal expenses, commemorative badges, fruit, cigarettes, snacks, bathing, haircuts, theater, or movie tickets; except in special circumstances, gasoline expenses will generally not be reimbursed for meetings, and sightseeing tours outside the city will not be organized. The plan also made strict regulations on medical expenses during meetings and the purchase of meeting supplies. Regarding miscellaneous expenses, the plan stipulates that all agencies should follow the standards stipulated by the finance department and strive to save 5% to 10%. To this end, a strict system for the receipt, review, and management of office supplies must be established, while also promoting the use of substitutes and waste materials; the line between public and private matters must be strictly drawn, the number of newspapers controlled, and water and electricity costs strictly saved; except for entertaining foreign guests, agency visitors will not be served fruit, snacks, etc., banquets will not be held, and gifts will not be given. For all kinds of delegate conferences, celebration meetings, and ceremonies, no banners or gifts should be presented except for award flags issued by the government. In the past, postal and telecommunications expenses were quite large, and in the future, management should be strengthened and strictly controlled. Whenever time permits, official letters should be used instead of telegrams and long-distance calls as much as possible; the use of long-distance calls and telegrams should be approved by responsible cadres of the agency, and manuscripts should be concise and to the point.

The plan stipulates that any agency or staff member must resolutely abide by the provisions of the state grain supply system, report inventory accurately, report population accurately, and oppose hoarding grain and making false reports or fraudulent claims. The management department of collective meals should formulate a strict grain saving system and educate managers and cooks to resolutely implement it.

The plan also requires all agencies to resolutely implement the regulations on the use of agency housing, vehicles, and equipment, save on purchase expenses as much as possible, strengthen the management of various equipment, improve the utilization rate of equipment, and extend the service life of equipment.
