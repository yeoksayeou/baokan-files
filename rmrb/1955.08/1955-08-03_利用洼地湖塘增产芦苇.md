    Increasing Reed Production by Utilizing Low-lying Pits, Lakes, and Ponds
    Editor's Note: Sun Shikuan, a teacher at Dongxuan Hudian Complete Primary School in the Third District of Yutian County, Hebei Province, wrote to the State Council on May 28, suggesting that the government call on farmers to massively increase reed production. After the General Office of the State Council forwarded this letter to the Agricultural Planning and Economic Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture for research, the Bureau concluded that planting reeds is indeed a good way to utilize barren low-lying land, lakes, ponds, and banks. It not only yields higher returns but also plays a role in consolidating riverbanks and conserving soil and water, which should be promoted. However, due to differing local conditions, development can only be carried out by various localities in accordance with local conditions at present, and it is difficult for the state to make unified plans.
    To draw attention to this matter, we are publishing Sun Shikuan's letter of recommendation below:
    Reeds are a perennial plant that grows in shallow ponds and ditches. The summer is the time to plant reeds. After planting, it takes three to four years for them to propagate into good reed fields, yielding a large harvest of reeds.
    Reeds are the main raw material for mats, which are essential for construction sites, warehouse storage, farmers' kang (heated brick beds), and stack covering. In addition to weaving mats, farmers also need reeds for building and repairing houses, making curtains, and making fishing weirs. With the development of national construction, the market for reeds is expanding. Therefore, large-scale reed planting can not only fully meet the needs of the state and the people but also increase farmers' sideline income. It is understood that in recent years, water conservancy projects, river channel changes, dike construction, and reservoir construction in various places have left a considerable area of soil extraction pits and abandoned river channels; at the same time, many places still have some shallow ponds, lakes, and swamps that have not been utilized. These are all good places to plant reeds, and it is hoped that the People's Government will take appropriate measures to encourage farmers to plant them in large quantities. 　Sun Shikuan

### 利用洼地湖塘增产芦苇

    利用洼地湖塘增产芦苇
    编者按：河北玉田县三区东轩湖甸完全小学教员孙世宽，在五月二十八日写信给国务院，建议政府号召农民大量增产芦苇。经国务院秘书处把这封信转农业部农业计划经济局研究，农业计划经济局认为种植芦苇确是利用荒芜的低洼地、湖塘、边岸的一个好办法，不但可以得到较高的收益，而且对巩固河岸、水土保持也有一定的作用，是应该提倡的。但各地具体情况不同，目前只能由各地因地制宜地发展，由国家做统一的计划是有困难的。
    为了引起各地注意，特将孙世宽的建议信发表于下：
    芦苇是一种宿根植物，生长在浅水池塘和沟渠里。每年夏季是种植芦苇的时期。插植后经过三四年就能繁殖成很好的苇田，收获大批的苇子。
    苇子是席的主要原料，而席子又是建筑工地、仓库保管、农民铺炕、苫垛等必不可少的东西。除编席外，农民拍房、盖房、打帘、打鱼箔也都需要用苇子。随着国家建设事业的开展，苇子的销路越来越广了。因此，大量种植芦苇，不但可以充分地满足国家和人民的需要，同时可使农民增加副业收入。据了解，几年来各地修水利、改河道、筑堤堰、建水库，留下了面积相当大的取土坑和废河道；同时不少地方还有一些浅水池塘、湖沼等没有利用。这些都是种植芦苇的好地方，希望人民政府采取适当措施鼓励农民大量种植。　孙世宽
