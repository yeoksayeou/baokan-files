To the Editor:

The reconstruction project of the Liushan Inclined Shaft of the Fushun Mining Bureau has failed to meet its targets from January to May of this year. In April, it only completed 31.4% of the planned work. Accidents during construction are frequent and increasing monthly, with a rise of 141.7% in May compared to January. The quality of most of the project does not meet design requirements. Taking tunneling as an example, the qualification rate often only reaches 50% to 60%. Due to these circumstances, costs have greatly exceeded the budget, with overspending exceeding 30% in both January and April.

The main reason for this serious situation is the severe bureaucracy and technological conservatism of the leading staff of the Liushan Engineering Office of the Fushun Mining Bureau, which is responsible for the reconstruction project of the Liushan Inclined Shaft. This project is designed according to the advanced standards of the Soviet coal mining industry. The tunnel is designed as a gothic arch, requiring the removal of supports and rigid arching during masonry. This design has already been implemented in mines such as Xi'an, Hegang, Shuangyashan, and the Laohutai mine in Fushun. However, Lü Renquan, the deputy chief engineer and deputy director of the engineering office, and Liu Yunxiu, the assistant engineer and head of the construction section, emphasized poor geological conditions and expanded the original design cross-section of 22.08 square meters to 31.28 square meters. During construction, technicians, fearing "insecurity," further increased it to 34 square meters. The workers actually worked on 34.7 square meters. Due to the expansion of the cross-section, from January to May, 2,200 cubic meters more rock were excavated than originally planned. If this continues, a total of 8,693 cubic meters more rock will be excavated by the time the entire tunneling project is completed, wasting 170,000 yuan. Moreover, after changing the original design, rigid arching cannot be implemented, and river sand must be used for filling, which will waste an additional 34,000 yuan.

I suggest that relevant leading authorities conduct an in-depth inspection of the work on this project, change this unfavorable situation, and ensure that the project is completed on schedule and put into production.

### 刘山斜井改建工程长期没有完成任务

　　刘山斜井改建工程长期没有完成任务编辑同志：
    抚顺矿务局刘山斜井改建工程从今年一月到五月一直没有完成任务，四月份甚至只完成计划百分之三十一点四。施工中的事故很多，而且逐月上升，五月份比一月份增加了百分之一百四十一点七。大部分工程质量不合乎设计要求，以掘进为例，合格率经常只达到百分之五、六十。由于以上情况，成本就大量超支，一月份和四月份都超支百分之三十以上。
    负责刘山斜井改建工程的抚顺矿务局刘山工程处领导工作人员的严重官僚主义和技术保守思想，是造成这种严重局面的主要原因。这项工程是按照苏联先进的煤矿工业的标准设计的，工程开凿为龙门拱型，砌碹时要撤回棚子，硬性砌碹。这种设计在我国西安、鹤岗、双鸭山和抚顺老虎台等矿山都已经推行了。可是工程处的副主任工程师兼副处长吕任权和助理工程师兼施工科长刘允秀，强调地质条件不好，把原设计二十二点零八平方公尺的断面扩大为三十一点二八平方公尺。施工时技术员怕“不保险”，又加到三十四平方公尺。而工人实际作的是三十四点七平方公尺。由于断面扩大，从一月份到五月份较原计划多开凿二千二百立方公尺的岩石。如果继续这样搞下去，到掘进工程全部完成时就要多开凿岩石八千六百九十三立方公尺，将浪费十七万元。而且改变了原设计后，就不能硬性砌碹，必须用河砂充填，这样又要浪费三万四千元。
    我建议有关领导机关深入检查这个工程的工作，改变这种恶劣局面，保证这个工程按期完成计划，投入生产。
