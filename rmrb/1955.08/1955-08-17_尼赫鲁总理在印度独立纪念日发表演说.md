Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 16th—More than 20,000 citizens of Delhi held a grand gathering at the Red Fort on the 15th to celebrate the eighth anniversary of Indian independence.

　　Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech at the meeting. When he spoke about the Goa issue, he said that Goa is part of India, and no force on earth can separate it. It is impossible for Goa to remain under the rule of a European country after India has gained its freedom.

　　Nehru congratulated the peaceful resisters who entered Goa on the 15th. He condemned the atrocities of Portuguese soldiers who recently opened fire on unarmed peaceful resisters. He said this was a violation of the norms of international law. The Portuguese government should now understand that this method will not achieve any results.

　　Nehru said that India would not resort to military means, but would only use peaceful methods to resolve the Goa issue.

　　Nehru also mentioned the improved international situation and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    尼赫鲁总理在印度独立纪念日发表演说
    新华社新德里十六日电　德里市民两万多人十五日在红堡举行盛大集会，庆祝印度独立八周年。
    尼赫鲁总理在会上发表了演说。他在谈到果阿问题时说，果阿是印度的一部分，地球上没有任何力量能够把它分开。在印度已经获得自由以后，果阿仍然处在欧洲国家的统治下，这是不可能的。
    尼赫鲁向十五日进入果阿的和平抵抗者表示祝贺。他谴责葡萄牙士兵最近向没有武装的和平抵抗者开枪的暴行。他说，这是违犯国际法的准则的。葡萄牙政府现在应该了解，这种方法是不能得到任何结果的。
    尼赫鲁说，印度不会采取军事手段，而只会用和平方法解决果阿问题。
    尼赫鲁还提到改善的国际局势和五项原则。
