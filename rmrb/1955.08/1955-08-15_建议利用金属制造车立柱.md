    Suggest Using Metal to Manufacture Wagon Stakes
    To the Editor:
    When the railway department transports timber, it needs to install wagon stakes on the wagons to bind the timber and prevent it from falling off. With the increase in timber supply, the need for wagon stakes is also increasing. However, according to the situation in the forest areas of Heilongjiang Province, currently, young birch trees with a diameter of ten centimeters and a length of three meters are being cut down to make wagon stakes, and they cannot be reused after one use. According to convention, one wagon stake is needed to load three cubic meters of timber, and three million wagon stakes are needed to transport nine million cubic meters of timber, equivalent to more than 85,700 cubic meters of timber. If calculated based on the number of young trees cut down, it is equivalent to 6,000 mu of afforestation area. At present, the construction of the motherland requires a large amount of timber, and our forest resources are not very abundant. Cutting down young trees to make wagon stakes is a great waste. I suggest that the relevant units of the Ministry of Railways study using metal to manufacture fixed wagon stakes, which can be flexibly installed on wagons loaded with timber, to replace wooden wagon stakes, so as to save timber.

    建议利用金属制造车立柱编辑同志：
    铁路部门在运输木材时，需要在车皮上安置车立柱，以便捆绑，防止木材外掉。随着木材供应量的增长，车立柱的需要量也越来越多。可是，根据黑龙江省林区的情况，目前都是砍用十公分粗、三公尺长的杨桦幼树做车立柱，而且使用一次就不能再用了。按惯例，装三立方公尺木材需要一根车立柱，运出九百万立方公尺木材就得三百万根车立柱，折合木材八万五千七百多立方公尺；如果用被砍掉的幼树株数计算，相当于六千亩地的造林面积。目前祖国建设需要大批木材，而我国的森林资源并不十分丰富，砍伐幼树做车立柱，是很大的浪费。我建议铁道部的有关单位研究用金属制造固定的车立柱，灵活地安置在装木材的车皮上，代替木质车立柱，以节约木材。
