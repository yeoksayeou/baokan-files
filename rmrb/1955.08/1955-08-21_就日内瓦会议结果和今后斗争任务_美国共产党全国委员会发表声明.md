Xinhua News Agency, August 20th: According to a report in the New York "Daily Worker," the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, after holding a meeting in early August, issued a statement on the results of the Geneva Four-Power Summit and the future tasks of struggle.

The statement pointed out that the Geneva Conference was a turning point in the international situation. It was the result of the struggle for peace by the American people and hundreds of millions of people around the world.

After analyzing the achievements of the Geneva Conference and the possibilities it offered, the statement pointed out that the Geneva Conference marked the beginning of the end of the Cold War. However, these possibilities can only be realized through the struggle of the people of all countries.

The statement pointed out that one of the achievements of the Geneva Conference and the overall improved international atmosphere was the holding of ambassadorial-level talks between China and the United States to discuss the repatriation of civilians and other issues. However, the American people should insist that these talks include more fundamental issues: they should lead to an end to Washington's provocative policies towards China and ensure full recognition of the legitimate rights of this great nation. This is essential for the security of the United States and the promotion of world peace.

The statement pointed out that the Geneva Conference was made possible because the American people and the people of all countries resolutely opposed the US government's policy of waging a cold war and frantically preparing for a world war. The statement said that despite misleading reactionary propaganda, the American people have made an indispensable contribution to the worldwide struggle for peace – which reached a climax in Geneva. Since the beginning of this year, people from all walks of life in the United States have been expressing their demands for peace and engaging in activities for peace in increasingly stronger ways.

The statement continued, Geneva is a symbol. It shows that what millions of Americans and people of other countries want is not a cold peace dictated by Wall Street, but a real and meaningful peace – coexistence and peaceful competition between capitalist and socialist countries.

This will not come about on its own. Achieving agreements on specific issues will require determined efforts by the people of all countries. Only through such agreements can the danger of war be further eased, and the Cold War finally ended.

The statement said that the American people, especially organized workers, have a responsibility to ensure that the seeds sown in Geneva will blossom and bear fruit. How to make the power of labor influence the future four-power foreign ministers' talks is a critical question. Broad discussions should be held in workshops and trade unions, and letters and resolutions should be sent to Eisenhower, members of Congress, and newspapers.

The statement said that the current moment requires all peace-loving Americans to launch a massive national crusade to demand the implementation of the Geneva Accords in the spirit of the Geneva Conference.

The statement continued, as part of this national crusade, the American people should also demand an end to the persecution of progressive people and labor leaders at home, an end to the domestic cold war – the war that infringes on American freedoms, which is essentially a product of the international cold war and the preparation for a final shooting war.

The statement called on all Communist Party members, all Party committees and groups, to make the Geneva Conference and the realization of its great promise of peace the main focus of their current concerns.

The statement concluded by saying that the American people can pay close attention to the future Geneva foreign ministers' conference in October, and start now to voice their demands in order to promote: a democratic and peaceful Germany within a European security arrangement; a ban on atomic and hydrogen bombs and nuclear weapons testing; the reduction of armies; the fullest cultural, economic and social exchanges between countries and the expansion of world trade; the admission of China to the United Nations, and a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue in accordance with the territorial rights of the People's China.

    就日内瓦会议结果和今后斗争任务
    美国共产党全国委员会发表声明
    新华社二十日讯　据纽约“工人日报”报道：美国共产党全国委员会在八月上旬举行会议以后，就日内瓦四国首脑会议的结果和今后的斗争任务发表声明。
    声明指出，日内瓦会议是国际局势中的一个转折点。它是美国以及世界各国亿万人民争取和平的斗争的结果。
    声明在分析日内瓦会议的成就和它所提供的可能性以后指出：日内瓦会议标志着冷战结束的开始。但是这些可能性只有通过各国人民的斗争才能实现。
    声明指出，日内瓦会议和全面改善的国际气氛的成果之一，是中美两国举行大使级会谈以讨论遣返平民问题和其他问题。但是美国人民应当坚持这种会谈包括更基本性的问题：它们应当导向结束华盛顿对中国的挑衅政策，并且使这个伟大国家的合法权利得到充分承认。这对美国的安全和促成世界的和平是十分必要的。
    声明指出，日内瓦会议之所以成为可能，是因为美国人民和世界各国人民坚决反对美国政府进行冷战和疯狂地准备世界战争的政策。声明说，尽管有混淆人们视听的反动宣传，美国人民仍然对全世界争取和平的斗争——它在日内瓦达到了一个高潮——作出了不可或少的贡献。从今年年初以来，美国各阶层人民一直在用各种不同的方式愈来愈强烈地发出了要求和平的呼声和展开了要求和平的活动。
    声明接着说，日内瓦是一个象征，它表明千百万美国人和其他国家的人民所要求的不是华尔街的冷和平，而是有血有肉的和平——资本主义国家和社会主义国家的共处和和平竞赛。
    这不会自己到来的。要在具体问题上达成协议将需要各国人民的坚决的努力。只有通过这样的协议，战争危险才能进一步和缓，冷战才能最后结束。
    声明说，美国人民，首先是有组织的工人，有责任来保证在日内瓦所播下的种子将开花和结果。如何使劳工的力量影响未来的四国外长谈判是一个关键性的问题。应当在车间和工会中展开广泛的讨论并且向艾森豪威尔、国会议员们和报纸寄出信件和决议。
    声明说，当前的时机要求一切爱好和平的美国人发动一个巨大的全国性的十字军运动要求按照日内瓦会议的精神履行日内瓦协议。
    声明接着说，作为这个全国性十字军运动的一个部分，美国人民还应当要求停止对国内进步人士和劳工领袖的迫害，停止国内的冷战——侵犯美国人自由的战争，它基本上是国际冷战和准备最后进行射击战的一种产物。
    声明号召共产党全体党员，一切党的委员会和小组，把日内瓦会议以及实现它的伟大的和平诺言作为他们当前关心的主要问题。
    声明最后说，美国人民能够密切注意未来的十月间的日内瓦外长会议，而且现在就开始发出他们的呼声，以便促成：置于一个欧洲安全安排内的一个民主、和平的德国；禁止原子弹和氢弹以及核子武器的试验；裁减军队；各国间最充分的文化、经济和社会交流以及世界贸易的扩大；接纳中国进入联合国，按照人民中国的领土权利和平解决台湾问题。
