Jiaozuo Mining Bureau Fully Exploits Residual Coal Deposits

    Workers at the Wangfeng and Lifeng Mines of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau in Henan Province are now, in addition to mining complete coalfields, extracting more than 2,500 tons of coal daily from the old exhausted areas plundered by British and Japanese imperialists. This year, they plan to recover 500,000 to 600,000 tons of raw coal for the country from these old exhausted areas.

    In order to conserve national resources and extend the life of the mines, the Communist Party organizations of the Wangfeng and Lifeng Mines repeatedly criticized the tendency among staff to favor the new and dislike the old. They fully mobilized technicians and veteran workers to locate more than two million tons of residual coal deposits in the old exhausted areas that had been plundered by British and Japanese imperialists. To extract this coal, the Communist Party organizations of the two mines recently suggested that the administration establish organizational structures for mining in the old exhausted areas and reform the recovery methods. A small number of administrative staff at the Wangfeng Mine believed that recovering coal from the old exhausted areas was inefficient, costly, and unsafe, and therefore not worth doing. The mine's Party General Branch repeatedly studied and criticized this capitalist ideology of pursuing profit and actively conducted underground surveys, compiled data, and formulated a plan to extract 300,000 tons of coal for the country from the old exhausted areas by the end of this year. The Lifeng Mine's Party General Branch synthesized the opinions of technicians and workers and suggested that the administration promote the Soviet Union's new coal mining methods in the old exhausted areas starting in May of this year. As a result, the recovery rate of residual coal has increased by more than 20 percent. (Our Collective Correspondent, Henan Daily Editorial Department)

    焦作矿务局充分开采残存煤藏
    河南焦作矿务局王封、李封两矿职工，现在除了开采完整的煤田以外，每天还要从英、日帝国主义掠采过的老乏区里采出两千五百多吨煤。他们今年计划在老乏区里为国家回采出原煤五十到六十万吨。
    为了节约国家资源延长矿井寿命，王封、李封两矿的中共组织反复批判了工作人员中的喜新厌旧思想，充分发动技术人员和老工人在英、日帝国主义掠采过的老乏区里找到了二百多万吨残存煤藏。为了把这些煤开采出来，最近两矿的中共组织又建议行政建立了在老乏区采煤的组织机构，并改革了回采方法。王封矿少数行政工作人员认为：回采老乏区的煤效率低、成本高，又不安全，不值得干。矿的党总支多次研究并批判了那种追求利润的资本主义思想，并积极进行井下调查，整理资料，制定了到今年年底在老乏区为国家采出三十万吨煤的计划。李封矿党总支则综合了技术人员和工人的意见，建议行政把苏联的新采煤方法从今年五月在老乏区推广，结果使残存煤的回收率提高了百分之二十多。　（本报集体通讯员河南日报编辑部）
