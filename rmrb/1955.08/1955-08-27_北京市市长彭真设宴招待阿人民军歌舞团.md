Beijing Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu presided over the banquet on behalf of Mayor Peng Zhen, who was unable to attend due to official business. In his speech, he first extended a warm welcome to the distinguished guests. Zhang Youyu said: "The Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe has only stayed in Beijing for a little over ten days, and has already performed seven very wonderful shows, attracting the broad masses of the people of Beijing and leaving behind a deep and unforgettable impression. On behalf of Mayor Peng Zhen and all the people of Beijing, I would like to express our sincere gratitude for your outstanding performances, and pay tribute to you, and through you, to the heroic Albanian people and the People's Army."
