　　The American People's Struggle for Peace
　　Ge Zhengjie
    At present, international tensions have eased to some extent. This is the result of the tireless efforts of the people of all countries to strive for peace and international security. The American people, under extremely difficult conditions, have also made due contributions to the struggle for the easing of international tensions.
    As everyone knows, the "Cold War" and the arms race are sources of huge profits for American arms dealers. However, their interests have nothing in common with the interests of the American people. For the American people, the arms race does not have any benefits. In the past few years, due to the active expansion of armaments and war preparations by the American government and the increase in military spending, taxes have increased substantially, and the tax burden on the working people has become heavier and heavier. Since 1948, the US military budget has increased by more than 2.5 times, which has made families with low incomes in the United States pay nearly one-third of their income in taxes in 1954. At the same time, because of inflation, currency devaluation, and rising prices, the actual income of the American working people has decreased, which has made the working people increasingly impoverished and suffering increasingly serious disasters.
    The Communist Party of the United States, as the core force of the American peace movement, although under various persecutions, has always adhered to the struggle against aggression, demanding international cooperation, and strengthening international trust for the benefit of the entire American people and world peace. In August last year, the Communist Party of the United States put forward a new program of "The Road for America to Employment, Peace and Democracy," pointing out the way for the American people to safeguard their rights and strive for peace. On the eve of the Geneva Four-Power Conference this year, Foster, chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, called on the American people to be vigilant and stop the conspiracy of certain war forces in the United States to sabotage the conference, and asked everyone to mobilize to urge the heads of the American government to make contributions at the meeting. Therefore, despite the existence of a large amount of reactionary propaganda in the United States that confuses people's minds, the American people, under the leadership or influence of the Communist Party of the United States, have taken effective steps and made indispensable contributions to the struggle of the people of the world for peace.
    American newspapers unanimously admit that the rapid surge of the American strike movement is one of the most noteworthy features of the current domestic political life in the United States. According to statistics from the American Labor Research Association, from 1953 to 1954, 8,491 strikes occurred in the United States, with 3.9 million workers participating. The strike struggle in the first few months of this year has further developed. According to official US statistics, 325 strikes occurred in January of this year, 380 in February, 450 in March, 500 in April, and 575 in May. It is worth noting that the strike movement of American workers to improve their living conditions is closely linked to the goal of ending the policy of war preparations and achieving a peaceful foreign policy. Because, everyone can see clearly that if the US government's policy of war preparations is not changed, the living conditions of workers and other working people will be further deteriorated. Therefore, many trade unions put forward the demand to stop the "Cold War" at the conferences held in 1954 and early 1955. For example, in March of this year, the American Mining, Smelting and Metal Workers' Union, which has more than 100,000 members, held its 50th representative meeting in Washington. The meeting passed a resolution advocating easing international tensions and holding meetings aimed at solving world problems, and demanded "immediate five-nation talks with China's participation to seek solutions to all major differences." In April of this year, the International Longshore and Warehouse Workers Union, an independent trade union on the Pacific coast of the United States, held its 11th representative conference in Long Beach, California. The union's chairman, Harry Bridges, made a report at the meeting, severely condemning the US policy of supporting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the militarization of West Germany. On April 29th this year, workers and other working people in New York, despite the persecution and obstruction of reactionary forces, held a rally in Union Square, New York, to celebrate May Day International Labor Day, putting forward slogans such as "We want peace, work and democratic freedom," "Ban atomic weapons," "Peace with China," and many other slogans demanding peace and international cooperation.
    The broad masses of ordinary Americans, who hold various different political views, are also increasingly aware of the harm of the US government's "Cold War" and crazy preparations for world war to mankind. Since the beginning of this year, they have been using various different ways to increasingly strongly express their calls for peace and launch activities demanding peace.
    In May of this year, just as the international community was brewing the convening of a Four-Power Conference to seek the easing of international tensions, some powerful figures in the United States were doing their best to advocate expanding armaments and war preparations, insisting that the major power conference could not achieve results. Therefore, a wide-ranging movement unfolded in the United States to strive for the achievement of positive results at the Geneva Conference. The "National Congress of Parents and Teachers," which has 9.5 million members, held a national representative conference in Chicago. Leonard, the chairman of this organization, called on the parents and teachers of American students to step up their efforts to strive for the easing of international tensions. Leonard said that our responsibility is to build a solid and lasting peace, and we should insist that American diplomats sit down and negotiate on unresolved international issues. Twenty organizations, including the Chicago Atomic Scientists Association, the Greater Chicago Church Federation, the Methodist World Peace Council, the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs, and the National Council of Jewish Women, established a new organization to strive for effective disarmament. The meeting decided to launch activities to strive for disarmament and demanded a halt to hydrogen weapons testing.
    Not only workers, peasants, and intellectuals, but also some women's organizations and religious groups, actively participated in this struggle. The American "Women's International League for Peace and Freedom" issued a statement before the Four-Power Summit, calling on the American people to write letters to Eisenhower and Dulles, requesting the holding of a major power conference to discuss the elimination of the threat of atomic war. The statement urged all American people to fight for universal disarmament, and said: The American "Women's International League for Peace and Freedom" currently requires people from all walks of life to take urgent action immediately to oppose hydrogen bomb tests and oppose the "bomb diplomacy" that threatens mankind. American religious groups, such as the American Church Organizations' Congregational Church organization in New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, held a meeting at the end of May. The resolution passed at the meeting expressed concern about the threat of atomic war and demanded the reduction of conventional armaments in various countries.
    According to statistics from the American "Gallup Poll," 74 percent of Americans are willing to hold talks with China, the Soviet Union, and other countries to seek a solution to the Taiwan situation. Although certain groups in the United States are extremely unwilling to abandon their policies of hostility, suspicion, and the "Cold War," under the increasingly developing situation of the American people's struggle for peace, these people are becoming more and more isolated. Senator McCarthy, who launched tyrannical attacks on international cooperation, is clearly no longer the most fashionable figure in the United States today. Some politicians with more realism can no longer indifferently treat the voices of the American people. Before the opening of the Four-Power Summit, ten US Congressmen wrote to Eisenhower, asking him to "seriously consider" the proposal to expand the ties between the United States and the Soviet Union. Senator Walter George, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, once advocated convening a foreign ministers' conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China. He believes that the normalization of relations between the United States and China will ensure significant achievements on the road to easing tensions in the Far East.
    It is precisely because of the firm opposition of the people of all countries and the American people to the US government's "Cold War" and crazy preparations for world war that the convening of the Geneva Conference became possible and achieved positive results. However, the American people also clearly recognize that those groups who are unwilling to abandon their policies of hostility, suspicion, and the "Cold War" are not reconciled to their failure. The supporters of the "Cold War" have been engaged in conspiracies against the cause of peace. Therefore, the struggle for peace must not stop here. As the recent statement issued by the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States pointed out, Geneva is a symbol, it shows that what millions of Americans and people of other countries want is not Wall Street's cold peace, but a peace of flesh and blood -- the coexistence and peaceful competition between capitalist countries and socialist countries. The statement said that the American people, first of all the organized workers, have a responsibility to ensure that the seeds sown in Geneva will blossom and bear fruit. … The current moment requires all peace-loving Americans to launch a massive national crusade demanding that the Geneva agreements be fulfilled in the spirit of the Geneva Conference.
    People have reason to believe that the peace fighters in the United States will win greater achievements in the struggle for peace.

### 美国人民争取和平的斗争

　　美国人民争取和平的斗争
　　葛正杰
    目前国际紧张局势有了某种程度的缓和。这是世界各国人民不倦地为争取和平和国际安全所作的巨大努力的结果。处在极端困难条件下的美国人民在争取国际局势缓和的斗争中，也作出了应有的贡献。
    大家知道，“冷战”和军备竞赛，是美国军火商人巨大利润的来源。但是，他们的利益同美国人民的利益是没有丝毫共同之处的。对美国人民来说，军备竞赛并没有任何好处。过去几年，就由于美国政府积极扩军备战，增加军费开支，结果，税收大量增加，劳动人民的赋税负担越来越沉重。从一九四八年以来，美国的军事预算就增加了二点五倍以上，这就使得美国低额收入的家庭在一九五四年要以将近三分之一的收入缴纳赋税。同时，又因为通货膨胀，货币贬值，物价上涨，美国劳动人民实际收入减少，这就使得劳动人民越来越贫困，遭受的灾难日益深重。
    作为美国和平运动核心力量的美国共产党，虽然处于各种迫害下，但是，为了美国全体人民的利益和世界的和平，始终坚持着反对侵略、要求国际合作和加强国际间信任的斗争。去年八月间，美国共产党便提出了“美国走向就业、和平与民主的道路”的新纲领，为美国人民指出了维护自己的权利和争取和平的道路。今年日内瓦四国会议前夕，美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特又号召美国人民，提高警惕，制止美国的某些战争势力破坏会议的阴谋，要求大家动员起来敦促美国政府首脑在会上作出贡献。因此，尽管在美国大量存在混淆人们视听的反动宣传，美国人民仍然在美国共产党的领导或影响下，对全世界人民争取和平的斗争采取了有效的步骤，作出了不可或少的贡献。
    美国报纸一致承认，美国罢工运动的急遽高涨是美国当前国内政治生活中最值得注意的特征之一。据美国劳工研究协会的统计，在一九五三到一九五四年，在美国发生了八千四百九十一次罢工，参加的工人有三百九十万人。今年头几个月的罢工斗争又有进一步的发展。据美国官方统计，今年一月份发生了三百二十五次罢工，二月份三百八十次，三月份四百五十次，四月份五百次，五月份五百七十五次。值得注意的是，美国工人为争取改善生活条件而进行的罢工运动，是和争取结束备战政策和对外实现和平政策的目标紧密联系着的。因为，谁都看得清楚，美国政府的备战政策如果不加以改变，工人和其他劳动人民的生活条件便将益加恶化。因此，许多工会在一九五四年和一九五五年初举行的大会上，都提出了停止“冷战”的要求。例如在今年三月间，拥有十多万会员的美国开采、冶炼工人工会在华盛顿举行了第五十届代表会议。会上就通过了一项决议，主张缓和国际紧张局势和举行目的在于解决世界问题的会议，并且要求“立即举行有中国参加的五大国谈判，以谋求解决一切重大分歧”。今年四月间，美国太平洋海岸独立的国际码头与仓库工人工会在加利福尼亚长滩举行了第十一次代表大会。这个工会的主席哈里·布里治在会上作了报告，严厉谴责美国支持蒋介石匪帮和西德军国主义化的政策。今年四月二十九日，纽约的工人和其他的劳动人民不顾反动势力的迫害和阻挠，在纽约联合广场举行集会庆祝了“五一”国际劳动节，提出了“我们要和平、工作和民主自由”，“禁止原子武器”，“同中国和平”和其他许多要求和平和国际合作的口号。
    具有各种不同政治见解的广大的普通美国人，也都日益认识到美国政府进行“冷战”和疯狂地准备世界战争对人类的危害性。从今年年初以来，他们就一直在用各种不同的方式愈来愈强烈地发出了要求和平的呼声和展开了要求和平的活动。
    今年五月间，正当国际间酝酿召开四大国会议以谋求国际紧张局势的缓和的时候，美国某些有权势的人物却在极力鼓吹扩军备战，硬说大国会议不能取得成效。因此，在美国展开了一个广泛的运动，争取日内瓦会议取得积极的成果。拥有九百五十万会员的“全国家长与教师大会”在芝加哥举行了一次全国代表大会，这个组织的主席伦纳德在会上号召美国学生的家长们和教师们加紧为争取缓和国际紧张局势而努力。伦纳德说，我们的责任是建立巩固而持久的和平，我们应该坚持要求美国的外交家们坐下来就悬而未决的国际问题进行谈判。在芝加哥原子科学家协会、大芝加哥教会联合会、卫理公会世界和平理事会、有色妇女俱乐部全国协会、犹太妇女全国理事会等二十个团体成立了一个争取有效裁减军备的新组织。会议决定展开争取裁减军备的活动，并要求停止氢武器的试验。
    不仅是工人、农民和知识分子，而且一些妇女组织和宗教团体，也积极地参加了这个斗争。美国
  “妇女争取和平和自由国际联盟”就曾在四国政府首脑会议以前发表声明，号召美国人民写信给艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯，要求举行大国会议来讨论消除原子战争威胁问题。这个声明敦促全体美国人民为争取普遍裁减军备而斗争，并且说：美国“妇女争取和平和自由国际联盟”目前要求各阶层人民立即采取迫切的行动，来反对氢弹试验，反对威胁人类的“炸弹外交政策”。美国的宗教团体如美国教会组织公理会在新泽西州、特拉华州、马里兰州、弗吉尼亚州和哥伦比亚特区的组织曾在五月底举行了一次会议。会上通过的决议对原子战争的威胁表示忧虑，并且要求裁减各国的常规军备。
    据美国“盖洛普民意测验所”的统计，百分之七十四的美国人愿意同中国、苏联和其他国家举行会谈，以谋求台湾局势的解决办法。美国某些集团虽然极不愿意放弃仇视、怀疑和“冷战”的政策，但是在美国人民争取和平的斗争日益发展的形势下，这一类人是越来越孤立了。对国际合作进行横暴攻击的参议员麦卡锡，在今天的美国显然已不是一个最时髦的人物了。一些比较有现实感的政治家，已不能再漠然对待美国人民的呼声。在四国政府首脑会议开幕前，美国十个众议员写信给艾森豪威尔，要求他“认真考虑”关于扩大美国和苏联之间的联系的主张。美国国会参议院外交委员会主席华·乔治曾经主张召开有中华人民共和国参加的外长会议。他认为，美国和中国关系的正常化将会保证在缓和远东紧张局势的道路上取得重大的成就。
    就由于各国人民和美国人民坚决反对美国政府进行“冷战”和疯狂地准备世界战争，日内瓦会议的召开才成为可能，并且取得了积极的结果。但是，美国人民也清楚地认识到，那些不愿意放弃仇视、怀疑和“冷战”政策的集团是不甘心于他们的失败的。“冷战”的拥护者们一直在从事反对和平事业的阴谋。因此，争取和平的斗争决不能到此停止下来。正如美国共产党全国委员会最近所发表的声明所指出，日内瓦是一个象征，它表明了千百万美国人民和其他各国人民所要求的不是华尔街的冷和平，而是有血有肉的和平——资本主义国家和社会主义国家的共处和和平竞赛。声明说，美国人民，首先是有组织的工人，有责任来保证在日内瓦所播下的种子将开花和结果。……当前的时机要求一切爱好和平的美国人发动一个巨大的全国性的十字军运动要求按照日内瓦会议的精神履行日内瓦协议。
    人们有理由相信，美国的和平战士们在争取和平的斗争中将会赢得更大的成就。
