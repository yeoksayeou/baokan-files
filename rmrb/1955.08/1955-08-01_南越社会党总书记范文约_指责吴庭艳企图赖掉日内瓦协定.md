Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 30th - South Vietnamese Socialist Party General Secretary Pham Van Bach held a press conference in Paris on the 28th. In his speech, Pham Van Bach accused Ngo Dinh Diem of trying to find a way to renounce the Geneva Accords. He said that Ngo Dinh Diem was "looking for loopholes," and this attitude was dangerous. There exists a danger of undermining the agreement, and the result may be a resumption of the war in Vietnam. He also said that the Ngo Dinh Diem government does not have any support from the people; it relies solely on force and suppression to maintain power.

Pham Van Bach said, "We demand full respect for the Geneva Accords." Pham Van Bach also requested the implementation of the Geneva Accords' provisions for organizing the 1956 Vietnamese general election, and demanded that the guarantor countries of this agreement promote this point.

    南越社会党总书记范文约
    指责吴庭艳企图赖掉日内瓦协定
    新华社三十日讯　巴黎消息：南越社会党总书记范文约二十八日在巴黎举行记者招待会。范文约在谈话中指责吴庭艳想设法赖掉日内瓦协定。他说，吴庭艳正在“寻找漏洞”，这种态度是危险的。这存在着一种破坏协定的危险，而结果将可能在越南恢复战争。他又说，吴庭艳政府得不到人民的任何支持，它只是靠武力和镇压来掌握政权。
    范文约说，我们要求完全尊重日内瓦协定。范文约还要求执行日内瓦协定关于组织一九五六年的越南普选的条款，并要求作为这个协定的保证国方面促进这点。
