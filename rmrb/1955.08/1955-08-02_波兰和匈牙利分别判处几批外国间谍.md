Xinhua News Agency, August 1st - According to TASS, Warsaw, July 30th: The Warsaw Garrison Military Court from July 21st to 27th tried and sentenced the spies Kaminski, Hoysen, Leholat, Nis, Pudashnik, Boichuk (alias Sokolovsky) and Tsvik, who were arrested by the State Security Agency in 1954.

　　The criminals had served in the Hitler military organization and were later recruited by British intelligence agencies.

These bandits, equipped with radio stations, weapons and other tools for espionage and sabotage activities, sneaked into Poland to carry out subversive activities.

　　During the trial, the defendants' crimes were fully confirmed. The court sentenced Kaminski, Hoysen, and Leholat to death, Pudashnik and Boichuk to life imprisonment, Nis to fifteen years imprisonment, and Tsvik to twelve years imprisonment.

　　Xinhua News Agency, July 24th - According to TASS, Budapest: Budapest newspapers reported on July 21st that the Military Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Hungarian People's Republic recently tried two groups of American spies and sentenced fifteen spies. The court sentenced Sándor Szilárd and László Gazda to death, Ene Benes and three other defendants to life imprisonment, and the other defendants were sentenced to imprisonment ranging from one to fifteen years. The death sentences of Szilárd and Gazda have been carried out.

　　These spies were recruited and trained by the American detective agency "Criminal Investigation Committee" and the so-called "Radio Free Europe," and then sent to Hungary to carry out sabotage work. The Hungarian Ministry of Internal Affairs, with the help of residents, arrested them and seized American-made weapons and ammunition, chemicals used to secretly contact foreign spy centers, and forged documents.
