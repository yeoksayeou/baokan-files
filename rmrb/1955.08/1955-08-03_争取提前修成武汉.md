Strive to Complete the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Ahead of Schedule
Teng Daiyuan, Minister of Railways

In the past few years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the national economy of the People's Republic of China has developed very rapidly. In order to adapt to this development and meet the requirements of national economic construction, it is necessary to ensure the smooth passage of railways and highways across the Yangtze River. The Government of the People's Republic of China foresaw this situation and decided to build the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge in 1950.

The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is the first bridge across the Yangtze River, the largest river in Asia. The project is complex and arduous. For nearly fifty years, rulers of past dynasties had repeatedly proposed to build this bridge, but it was never realized because it was beyond the capacity of the rulers of old China, the reactionary Kuomintang government, and foreign capital. Only today, when the Chinese people have become masters of their country, are starting socialist construction with full enthusiasm under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and with the help of Soviet experts, can this problem be truly solved.

In order to build this bridge, the Ministry of Railways conducted bridge site surveys and preliminary designs in 1953. Later, with the assistance of Soviet experts, the Ministries of Railways and Geology conducted detailed engineering geological exploration of the bridge site with advanced technology. Subsequently, the Wuhan Bridge Engineering Bureau, with the direct assistance of Soviet experts, compiled the complex bridge technical design in a very short period of time. This design fully adopts the latest achievements of Soviet and Chinese engineering technology, and the government has given it very high praise.

The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is a very complex project. The Yangtze River's depth reaches 40 meters, and the current is very rapid. The bedrock is buried very deep, and the geological conditions are complex, making it impossible to use ordinary methods such as caissons, cofferdams, and piling to build the bridge pier foundations of the main bridge. The high water level of the river lasts too long, up to eight months each year. There are many rainy days in the Yangtze River basin, and strong winds often blow, which further increases the difficulty of the construction project. Moreover, this bridge is a great building and one of the largest bridges in Asia. The difficulty of the project can also be seen from the content of the technical design. The technical design stipulates that the bridge crossing line includes: a double-track railway and highway dual-purpose, two-story Yangtze River Bridge with a total length of 1,700 meters; a Han River double-track railway bridge; a Han River highway bridge; eleven overpasses across streets; twelve kilometers of railway lines; two and a half kilometers of highway lines; and small bridges and culverts on the connecting lines. These projects require a large amount of reinforced concrete and complex technical measures.

Such a great project would be unimaginable without the sophisticated technical assistance of the Soviet Union, and first of all, the difficulty of building the pier foundations of the main bridge could not be overcome. In order to overcome the difficulties and avoid using the "compressed air caisson" method for the main bridge pier foundations, Soviet experts suggested using a completely new drilling method. After testing, it was confirmed that this method is technically reasonable, valuable, and feasible. Building the pier foundations of the main bridge with this method has the following advantages: it completely eliminates the harm of working in compressed air; it can be carried out throughout the year, which is impossible with the caisson method; it greatly reduces the purchase and use costs of machinery; it maximizes the use of domestic cadres and technology; and it shortens the construction period of the bridge. In addition, if this method is further improved, it can also be widely used when building other bridge piers.

With the strong assistance of Soviet experts, all the design and construction personnel of the Wuhan Bridge have carried out tenacious and creative labor to learn and master this advanced construction method, and they have full confidence in successfully completing the task.

In the past two years, thanks to the great importance attached to this project by the Party, the government, and the city of Wuhan, the selfless assistance of Soviet experts, and the enthusiastic labor of all the bridge staff, great achievements have been made in construction organization. During the project, the following tasks were completed: the Han River Railway Bridge and the two overpasses on its connecting line; the construction of the Han River Highway Bridge piers and the manufacturing of steel beams; the opening of traffic to Hanyang Station; the preparation work for the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge; and the experimental work of building the main bridge pier foundations without caissons.

According to the current situation, the preparation work for the Wuhan Bridge project is relatively well-founded. Therefore, it is possible to strive for the opening of the railway bridge within 1958 and the highway bridge in early 1959. The conditions are: first, because the bridge engineering of the bridge is constructed using new methods, coupled with the achievements in the preparation work, the main works of the bridge project can be started ahead of schedule; second, the Shanhaiguan and Shenyang bridge factories will manufacture large-span steel beams in the shortest possible time. With the help of Soviet experts, they have begun to formulate the preparation work for the steel structure manufacturing operation process according to the advanced Soviet methods, and they have full confidence in completing this task. Anshan Iron and Steel Company also provides great support to the bridge project and will produce a large amount of structural steel for the bridge and its ancillary buildings; third, the Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau has formed a strong engineering team with construction experience in building the Han River Bridge; more importantly, Soviet experts are also participating in the technical leadership of the construction project, which fully guarantees the quality of the project.

The creative cooperation between Chinese and Soviet bridge builders has brought good results to the bridge project. It is completely believable that not only can this project be completed ahead of schedule, but it will also improve the working ability of Chinese bridge builders and cultivate a large number of cadres.

But this does not mean that there are no difficulties in the bridge project at present! On the contrary, there are still many difficulties to overcome in the future. It is also necessary to improve the technical operation process of pier construction, greatly reduce project costs, and increase the speed of work. What is especially important is that the relevant departments still need to continue to provide strong support. All the staff working on the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge must always think of the care and expectations of the people, the Party, and the government, strive to improve their technical level, and further organize their strength to build the bridge well, quickly, and economically with selfless labor, making it a milestone in the technological transformation of China's railways.

    争取提前修成武汉长江大桥
    铁道部长　滕代远
    几年来，中华人民共和国在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，国民经济的发展十分迅速，为了适应这种发展和满足国家经济建设的要求，必须保证长江南北铁路和公路的畅通，中华人民共和国政府预见了这种情况，一九五○年就已决定要修建武汉长江大桥。
    武汉长江大桥，是跨越亚洲最大河流——长江的第一座桥，工程是复杂和艰巨的。近五十年来，过去历代的统治者虽曾多次提出要修建这座大桥，但始终未能实现，因为这是旧中国的历代统治者、国民党反动政府和外国资本所不能举办的。只有今天，当中国人民作了国家的主人，在中国共产党领导下，以饱满的热情开始社会主义建设的时候，并在苏联专家的帮助下才能真正解决这个问题。
    为了修建这座大桥，铁道部在一九五三年曾作了桥址的勘测和初步设计；以后，铁道和地质两部在苏联专家的帮助下，更以高深的技术对桥址进行了详细的工程地质勘探工作；接着，武汉大桥工程局在苏联专家直接帮助下，在很短的时间内编成了复杂的桥梁技术设计。这项设计，充分地采用了苏联和中国工程技术的最新成就，政府对此曾给以极高的评价。
    武汉长江大桥是一项十分复杂的工程。长江的江身水深达四十公尺，而且水流甚急，岩盘埋藏很深、地质条件复杂，无法采用普通方法如沉箱、沉井及打桩等方法来修建正桥的桥墩基础；江水高水位的持续时间过长，每年达八个月之久，大江流域降雨天数很多，又常刮大风，更增加了建设工程的困难；而这座桥梁是一个伟大的建筑物，又是亚洲最大桥梁之一。从技术设计的内容上，也可以看出工程的艰巨性。在技术设计中规定了桥渡线包括：双线铁路、公路两用的双层的全长一千七百公尺的长江大桥；汉水双线铁路桥；汉水公路桥；跨越街道的十一座跨线桥；十二公里铁路线；二点五公里公路线；联络线上的小桥涵管。这些工程需要大量的钢筋混凝土和复杂的技术措施。
    像这样一个伟大的工程，没有苏联精湛的技术援助，要想完成是不可想像的，首先修建正桥桥墩基础的困难就无法克服。为了克服困难，避免正桥桥墩基础使用“压气沉箱”的方法，苏联专家建议采用完全新颖的钻孔施工方法，经过试验，证实了这种方法在技术上是合理的、宝贵的、切实可行的。以这种方法修建正桥桥墩有以下几个优点：完全摆脱在压缩空气中工作的害处；可全年进行工作，而使用沉箱方法则是不可能的；大量地减低机具购置和机具使用费；最大限度地利用国内干部和技术；缩短大桥工期。此外，如把这种方法继续改善，修建其他大桥墩台时也可普遍采用。
    在苏联专家大力帮助下，武汉大桥全体设计和施工人员为学习和掌握这种先进的施工方法，进行了顽强的、创造性的劳动，他们对胜利完成任务具有充分信心。
    两年来，由于党、政府及武汉市对这一工程的极大重视、苏联专家的无私援助以及大桥全体职工的热情劳动，在施工组织方面也曾取得很大成绩，在工程期间曾完成了下面几项工作：汉水铁路桥及其联络线上的两座跨线桥；汉水公路桥墩台修建及钢梁制造工作；通车至汉阳车站；进行了长江大桥的施工准备工作；进行了不用沉箱修建正桥桥墩基础的试验工作。
    根据目前情况看来，武汉大桥工程的准备工作是较有基础的，因此争取铁路桥于一九五八年内，公路桥于一九五九年初通车是可能的。其条件是：首先由于大桥的桥梁工程是采用新的方法进行施工，加上在准备工作中的成就，使大桥工程的主要工程能提前开工；其次，山海关和沈阳两桥梁工厂，将在尽可能短的时间内制造出大跨度的钢梁，他们已在苏联专家帮助下，按照苏联的先进方法开始制订钢结构制造作业过程的准备工作，并有充分信心完成这项任务。鞍山钢铁公司也对大桥工程给以极大的支援，将为大桥及其附属建筑物制出大量的型钢；再次，长江大桥工程局已组成了具有修建汉水桥施工经验的强有力的工程队伍；更重要的是苏联专家还参加了修建工程的技术领导工作，这就使工程质量有了充分保证。
    经过中苏两国桥梁建设者创造性的合作，给大桥工程带来了良好的效果，完全可以相信，这项工程不但可以争取提前完成，并且将使中国桥梁建设者的工作能力得到提高，可以培养出大批的干部。
    但这并不是说目前在大桥工程中没有困难了！恰恰相反，以后还有很多困难需要克服，还需改善桥墩修建的技术作业过程，需要大大降低工程造价和提高工作的速度。尤其重要的是尚需有关部门继续地予以大力支援。建设武汉长江大桥的所有工作人员必须随时想到人民、党和政府的关怀和期待，努力提高自己的技术水平，并进一步组织自己的力量，以忘我的劳动把大桥修建得又好、又快、又省，使它成为中国铁路技术改造的里程碑。
