　　被捕的美机驾驶员感谢朝中方面给予人道待遇
    新华社平壤二十五日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：八月二十三日下午三时，朝中方面在军事分界线上把八月十七日侵入朝中方面军事控制下的领土后被俘获的美国驾驶员本帕斯少尉交给了美方，并且把布朗上尉的尸体也交给了美方。
    朝中方面根据美方的要求，先把本帕斯少尉交给美方。
    朝中方面的移交军官在把他交给美方时，问了他几个问题。本帕斯少尉回答说，待遇和环境是很好的。他说，朝中方面的医疗也是极为令人满意的。
    朝中方面的移交军官祝他早日恢复健康。他表示感谢。
    然后移交了布朗上尉的尸体。布朗的尸体已经用酒精消毒，用洁白的亚麻布包扎，安放在木棺内。
    移交和接收工作完毕后，美方的接收军官对朝中方面表示感谢。
    在移交开始前，本帕斯向记者发表了谈话。他谈到他受的创伤在朝中方面医务工作者的照料下获得治疗，并且谈到他得到很好的住所、衣服和“吃不完”的食物。
    他说，我这样一个非法的侵入者得到这样一种待遇，不能不深为感动。在我留在这里的几天中，我第一次体会到了真正的人道主义。我特别深切地认识到朝鲜人民的这种人道主义精神是同他们的要求和平的意愿分不开的。
