    North and South Vietnam are One Family
    By Zhan Chao, Our Correspondent in Vietnam

    The call for convening a consultative conference to discuss and prepare for the free general election next year to unify the country has become the loudest and most universal voice of the Vietnamese people today. Recently, even Tran Van Huu, the former Prime Minister, and Nguyen Van Hinh, the Chief of Staff of the former Bao Dai government living in France, have publicly issued statements endorsing the immediate holding of a consultative conference between North and South Vietnam to discuss the issue of free general elections.

    Anyone who respects historical facts will admit that Vietnam has been a unified country since very early times. Vietnam's territory, from north to south, from the Sino-Vietnamese border to Ca Mau Cape in the Gulf of Siam, is an indivisible whole. Living on this land are the heroic and hardworking people of all ethnic groups in Vietnam, with an ancient culture and a common economic life. Many feudal rulers and foreign invaders in the past attempted to rule Vietnam through division and separation, but in the end, they all failed under the resistance of the Vietnamese people of all ethnic groups, and Vietnam regained its unity.

    In modern times, French colonialists and Japanese imperialists also adopted the vicious tactic of "divide and rule" to enslave Vietnam, but they were ultimately subject to historical sanctions.

    The French colonialists stubbornly divided the country into three parts: Cochinchina (South), Annam (Central), and Tonkin (North), establishing different forms of political institutions and restricting the free movement of people. This can be said to be the most vicious of all the division policies implemented by rulers in the past, but it did not succeed. On the contrary, it aroused even more intense resistance from the Vietnamese people of all ethnic groups.

    During the French colonial rule, almost every year, struggles against colonial rule of various forms, large and small, broke out. These struggles often broke through the artificial boundaries created by the colonialists, forming nationwide movements.

    In August 1945, under the leadership of the Indochinese Communist Party (the predecessor of the Vietnam Workers' Party) and the Vietnam Independence League, the Vietnamese people launched a general uprising throughout the country, overthrowing the rule of Japanese imperialism and establishing the free, independent, and unified state of the Vietnamese people—the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In December 1946, under the leadership of the Indochinese Communist Party (the predecessor of the Vietnam Workers' Party) and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnamese people launched a heroic war of resistance throughout the country, finally shattering the French colonialists' dream of re-establishing colonial rule in Vietnam and preventing the international warmongering forces from continuing and expanding the Indochina War, and signed the Geneva Agreement on the cessation of hostilities. The historically significant Geneva Conference solemnly declared in its final declaration that it respects the independence, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam, respects the democratic and free rights of the Vietnamese people, and stipulates that a free general election be held throughout Vietnam in July 1956 to establish a unified national democratic government.

    The Geneva Agreement is a great achievement of the Vietnamese people's long-term struggle for the independence and unity of their motherland. In Vietnam, with the exception of a few political groups with ulterior motives, everyone wholeheartedly supports the Geneva Agreement and is determined to work for its thorough implementation. Because the full implementation of the Geneva Agreement will not only guarantee lasting peace in Vietnam, but will also enable Vietnam to achieve true unity and independence, which is the strong desire of the Vietnamese people.

    In order to implement the Geneva Agreement, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, while correctly implementing the military clauses, proactively proposed to the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities in South Vietnam to restore normal relations between the North and the South. After the military regroupment was completed, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam repeatedly requested to hold a consultative conference with the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities in South Vietnam to discuss the issue of free general elections.

    The solemn proposition of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has received warm response and support from the Vietnamese people. The mass movement demanding the convening of a consultative conference to discuss the issue of free general elections is not only freely and universally developing in various places in the North, but is also widely developing in the Southern regions under the suppression of the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities. On July 3rd, the people of Saigon, braving the suppression, arrest, and killing by the Ngo Dinh Diem group's military police, held a demonstration of thousands of people demanding consultation and preparation for free general elections; on July 10th, the people of Saigon held a large-scale strike; on July 26th, the people of Saigon and Cholon held rallies in five places, including Binh Dien, demanding that the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities quickly respond to the July 19th note from the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and immediately hold a consultative conference. At the same time, the movement is also vigorously developing in many other places in South Vietnam. The Ngo Dinh Diem group's radio station was also forced to admit on July 28th that "there are so many slogans written on the walls to overthrow Ngo Dinh Diem and demand consultation and general election that they can't be erased!"

    "North and South Vietnam are one family!" has now become the sacred and inviolable slogan of the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people's desire to convene a consultative conference to prepare for a free general election to achieve unification cannot be stopped by any force.

    越南南北是一家
    本报驻越南记者　展潮
    要求召开协商会议讨论和准备明年的自由普选以统一全国，已经成为越南人民当前最响亮、最普遍的呼声了。最近，甚至连住在法国的前保大政府总理陈文友和参谋长阮文馨，也都先后公开发表了声明，赞同越南南北双方立即举行协商会议以讨论自由普选问题。
    任何一个尊重历史事实的人都会承认：从很早起，越南就是一个统一的国家。越南的国土自北到南，自中、越边境直到暹罗湾的金瓯角，是一个不可分割的整体。在这块土地上，居住着有着古老文化、有着共同经济生活的英勇勤劳的越南各族人民。历代许多封建统治者和外来侵略者曾经企图用割据和分治的办法来统治越南，但是最后都是在越南各族人民的抗击下失败了，越南又重新恢复了统一。
    在近代，法国殖民主义者和日本帝国主义者也曾经采取“分而治之”的毒辣手段来奴役越南，但是他们都终于免不了受到历史的制裁。
    法国的殖民主义者曾硬把这个国家分成交趾支那（南部）、安南（中部）、东京（北部）三个部分，分别建立不同形式的政权机构，并且限制人民的自由往来，这可以说是历来统治者施行分治政策中最恶毒的一种，可是它并没有成功，相反地，却更加激起越南各族人民猛烈的抵抗。
    在法国殖民者统治时期，几乎每一年都要爆发或大或小各种形式反殖民统治的斗争，这种斗争往往是突破殖民者人为的界线，形成了全国性的运动。
    一九四五年八月，越南人民在越南劳动党的前身印度支那共产党和越南独立同盟的领导下，在全国范围内举行了总起义，推翻了日本帝国主义的统治，建立起越南人民自由、独立、统一的国家——越南民主共和国。一九四六年十二月，越南人民又在越南劳动党的前身印度支那共产党和越南民主共和国政府的领导下，在全国展开了英勇的抗战，最后终于粉碎了法国殖民者重新在越南实行殖民主义统治的迷梦，制止了国际好战势力企图继续和扩大印度支那战争的阴谋，在日内瓦签订了停止敌对行动的协定。具有历史意义的日内瓦会议，在它的最后宣言里庄严地宣布尊重越南的独立、统一和领土完整，尊重越南人民的民主自由权利，并且规定在一九五六年七月内举行全越自由普选来建立全国统一的民主政权。
    日内瓦协定，是越南人民长期为自己祖国的独立、统一而斗争所取得的伟大成果。在越南，除了少数别有用心的政治集团之外，所有的人都衷心一致地拥护日内瓦协定，并决心为彻底实施日内瓦协定而努力。因为日内瓦协定的全部实施，不仅将保证越南的持久和平，而且也将使越南达到真正的统一和独立，这是越南人民的强烈愿望。
    为了贯彻日内瓦协定，越南民主共和国政府在正确执行军事条款的同时，即主动地向南越吴庭艳当局提议恢复南北正常关系。军事集结工作结束后，越南民主共和国政府又一再要求和南越吴庭艳当局举行协商会议以讨论自由普选问题。
    越南民主共和国政府的严正主张，获得了越南人民热烈的响应和支持。要求召开协商会议讨论自由普选问题的群众性运动，不仅在北方各地自由地、普遍地开展着，同时也在吴庭艳当局压制下的南方地区广泛地发展起来了。七月三日，西贡人民冒着吴庭艳集团军警的弹压、捕杀的危险，上千人举行了要求协商准备自由普选的示威游行；七月十日，西贡人民举行了规模巨大的罢工罢市；七月二十六日，西贡和堤岸人民又分别在平田等五处举行大会，要求吴庭艳当局迅速答覆越南民主共和国政府七月十九日的照会，立即举行协商会议。同时，运动也正在南越其他许多地方蓬勃地开展着。吴庭艳集团的广播电台在七月二十八日也被迫承认说：“在墙上写的打倒吴庭艳和要求协商、要求普选的标语多到擦也擦不完！”
    “越南南北是一家！”现在已经成为越南全国人民神圣不可侵犯的口号。越南人民要求召开协商会议准备自由普选以实现统一的愿望，是任何力量也阻挡不住的。
