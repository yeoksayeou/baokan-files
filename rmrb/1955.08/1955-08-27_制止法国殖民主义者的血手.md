　　French authorities have carried out unprecedentedly brutal military suppression in Morocco and Algeria for days. Thousands of people fighting for freedom have been massacred, and entire towns and villages have been razed to the ground. In some areas, the colonial army has left nothing alive in its wake. For days, the most savage and heinous crimes of colonial rule have been on display throughout Morocco and Algeria. The barbaric massacres by the French colonial army are still continuing, with no sign of stopping.

　　The atrocities of the French colonialists in North Africa have shocked the world. It has aroused the greatest public indignation among people all over the world, especially in Asian and African countries. Protests and condemnations have resounded in every corner of the world. Even French newspapers have angrily denounced this "war whose name cannot be spoken," advocating that "the adventure that has spilled too much blood must be resolutely stopped."

　　The Chinese people believe that the atrocities of the French colonialists in North Africa are a challenge to human justice and conscience by the colonialists, and a challenge to the common will of the Asian and African people to resolutely strive for and safeguard independence.

　　The Asian-African Conference held four months ago passed a resolution "declaring that colonialism in all its manifestations is an evil which should be speedily brought to an end," and specifically declared "its support of the rights of the people of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia to self-determination and independence and urges the French Government to bring about a peaceful settlement of the issue without delay." Today, when the national consciousness of the Asian and African people has been strengthened a hundredfold, the French colonialists openly disregard the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference, and not only refuse to consider the legitimate aspirations of the North African people for national independence, but also attempt to maintain their decadent colonial rule in North Africa with brutal and large-scale massacres. This is absolutely intolerable. The violent policies of the French colonialists have turned Morocco and Algeria into a world of terror, and have caused serious unrest throughout North Africa and the Middle East, threatening peace in these regions. The bloody hands of the French colonialists must be stopped, and colonialism in all its manifestations must be eradicated. This is a firm and unswerving conclusion.

　　It is worth noting that the French colonial army is using American weapons to massacre the North African people, and the representatives of Arab countries are preparing to protest to the United States about this. Now, while North Africa is awash in blood, the United States, on the one hand, expresses its intention to adopt a policy of non-interference, and on the other hand, sends eight more military helicopters to aid the French colonial army, "to help search for or massacre Algerian rebels." This approach by the United States is not beneficial to the current situation in North Africa or to the cause of consolidating peace.

　　No matter how brutal the colonialists are, they have not been able to overwhelm the North African people, who are full of confidence in their cause of liberation. The resolute struggle of the Moroccan and Algerian people for national independence and freedom cannot be suppressed. In the ongoing struggle, the Moroccan and Algerian people are united as one and are continuing to resist the French colonialists; they are supporting each other, overcoming difficulties, and fighting heroically and unyieldingly for their solemn cause of winning independence and freedom. All just people around the world stand on their side; all people who desire freedom and independence stand on their side. The colonialists are bound to fail; the people of Morocco and Algeria are bound to win final victory.

### 制止法国殖民主义者的血手

    制止法国殖民主义者的血手
    法国当局连日在摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚进行了空前残暴的军事镇压。数以千计的为自由而斗争的人民惨遭屠杀，整个村镇被夷平。在有些地区，殖民军队所过之处，没有留下一个有生命的东西。几天以来，在整个摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚呈现了殖民统治最野蛮、最凶暴的罪恶图景。法国殖民军队的野蛮屠杀至今还在继续，并无丝毫停止的迹象。
    法国殖民者在北非的暴行震动了全世界。它激起了全世界人民，特别是亚洲和非洲各国人民最大的公愤。抗议和谴责的呼声响遍了全世界的每个角落。甚至法国国内的报刊也愤怒斥责这一场“不忍道其名称的战争”，主张“必须断然制止已经流了太多的鲜血的冒险”。
    中国人民认为法国殖民者在北非的暴行是殖民主义者向人类正义和良心的挑战，是殖民主义者向亚非人民坚决争取和维护独立的共同意志的挑战。
    四个月前举行的亚非会议曾经通过决议，“宣布殖民主义在其一切表现中都是一种应当迅速予以根除的祸害”，并特别宣布“支持阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥和突尼斯人民的自决和独立权利，并要求法国政府不迟延地促成这一问题的和平解决”。在亚非各国人民的民族自觉已经百倍地加强了的今天，法国殖民主义者竟公然无视亚非会议的决议，不但不肯考虑北非人民要求民族独立的正当愿望，反而企图用残暴的、大规模的屠杀来维持其在北非的腐朽的殖民统治。这是绝对不能容忍的。法国殖民主义者的暴力政策，已使摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚成为恐怖世界，而且在整个北非和中东地区都引起了严重的不安，使这些地区的和平受到威胁。法国殖民主义者的血手必须制止，一切表现中的殖民主义必须根除，这是一定不移的结论。
    值得注意的是，法国殖民军队屠杀北非人民用的是美国的武器，阿拉伯国家的代表为此已准备向美国提出抗议。现在，当北非正在血流成河的时候，美国一方面表示要采取不干涉态度，另一方面，却又加派八架军用直升飞机去援助法国殖民军队，“帮助搜索或屠杀阿尔及利亚叛乱分子”。美国的这种做法对于北非当前的局势和巩固和平的事业，都是没有好处的。
    不管殖民主义者怎样凶残，他们并没有能把对自己的解放事业充满信心的北非人民压倒。摩洛哥人民和阿尔及利亚人民为了争取民族独立和自由的坚决斗争是不可能被镇压下去的。在正在进行的斗争中，摩洛哥人民和阿尔及利亚人民团结得像一个人一样正在继续反抗法国殖民者；他们正在相互支援，战胜困难，不屈不挠地为自己的争取独立自由的庄严事业而英勇奋斗。全世界正义人类站在他们的一边；一切愿望自由和独立的人民站在他们的一边。殖民主义者是一定要失败的；摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚的人民一定要最后胜利。
