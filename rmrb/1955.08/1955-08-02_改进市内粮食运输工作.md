Improve the City's Grain Transportation Work
    Ma Zhen

    The grain needed by Beijing is mainly transferred from other places. The city's grain transportation department has always believed that doing a good job in receiving the grain is their only responsibility. As for intra-city transportation, they believe that supply work is managed by the operating departments, transportation capacity is allocated by the transportation companies, and freight is borne by the cargo owners, so it is not within their scope of work. Therefore, little attention is paid to the rationality or irrationality of intra-city transportation.

    After the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, the situation has changed greatly. According to regulations, the transportation department is responsible for intra-city transportation, the allocation of transportation capacity, and the payment of freight. As a result, the shortcomings in the city's grain transportation work were quickly exposed. At the same time, it was discovered that in the grain storage work, only the convenience of storage was taken into account, and the balanced distribution of supply was ignored (such as corn being stored only in a warehouse in the eastern suburbs). The waste of manpower due to trucks waiting for scales and scales waiting for trucks was very serious, and irrational phenomena such as detours and backflows frequently occurred. For example, the Haidian District Cooperative had to spend more than 110 yuan in freight to pick up 80,000 jin of white corn from the eastern suburbs warehouse than from the Xizhimen warehouse. Some cooperatives send the grain purchased on behalf of others to the warehouse today, and have to go through the procedures to pick it up tomorrow. This not only wastes transportation capacity and freight, but also increases unnecessary administrative work for warehouse personnel. In particular, for minor grains, the sales volume of each consignment unit is not large, but there is a widespread need. Due to the unbalanced distribution of varieties, the phenomenon of "visiting door to door" and "scattered flower lanterns" in roundabout transportation constantly occurs.

    In order to change the previous situation, the transportation department of the Beijing Grain Bureau proposed a rational transportation method of "fixed warehouse, fixed point." This method is: with the warehouse as the center, according to the warehouse's capacity and delivery capacity, the needs of supply (including the number of people and the required varieties and grades), the distribution of processing plants and consignment units, etc., rationally divide the supply area, and a certain warehouse is responsible for supplying consignment units within a certain range. Grain transferred from other places is allocated to each warehouse in a planned manner according to the supply tasks and supply rules of each warehouse, according to variety and quantity. Reserve grain is placed in warehouses farther from the city. The shortest transportation route should be selected for reasonable adjustment. Efforts should be made to ensure that each warehouse stores a complete range of varieties and sufficient quantities so that consignment units in this area no longer have to go to warehouses in other areas to pick them up.

    Starting in August 1954, they first experimented with this method in the Qianmen District, with the Yongdingmen warehouse as the center. They drew a map, classified retail companies, cooperatives, and consignment stores into different types, marked the mileage from the warehouse with different color symbols, and pointed out the rational direction for direct transportation. Then, the grain selling units submitted a grain demand plan, which was handed over to the warehouse to allocate vehicles according to the plan and deliver the grain directly to the sales point. At the same time, a unified plan, unified consignment, and unified payment of freight method (allocated by the bank) were implemented; and a system of regularly picking up grain and regularly allocating minor grains was stipulated. The date, time, variety, and quantity of grain withdrawal for each unit were also listed in detail so that the warehouse could make preparations according to the plan.

    In the past, the transportation of grain supplied in the city was unplanned. It was picked up whenever needed, and all parties were very passive. After the implementation of this method, the city's grain transportation work has been put on a planned track. It not only solves the problem of uneven workload for warehouse personnel, but also provides favorable conditions for warehouse personnel to implement work quotas, and enables the warehouse to reasonably arrange work and lay the foundation for improving business management.

    The new method was implemented, transportation was carried out according to plan, the turnover of vehicles was accelerated, the time spent on the road was shortened, transportation efficiency was improved, and freight was saved. For example, the average freight for grain per 100 jin in the Qianmen District Cooperative in July 1954 was 1 jiao 3 fen 3 li 7 hao. After the new method was implemented, it was reduced to 1 jiao 0 fen 9 li 8 hao per 100 jin in August, saving 2 fen 3 li 9 hao in freight per 100 jin of grain. Calculated according to the transportation volume in August, a total of more than 350 yuan in freight was saved. Transportation efficiency increased by 30%. The transportation department's freight income increased by an average of 6 li per 100 jin compared to the past.

    After the implementation of the new method, the connection between grain work departments, transportation companies, retail companies, and cooperatives has been strengthened, and the work of all parties has been improved. The grain withdrawal procedures have been simplified, saving a lot of time. The consignment units have reduced the need for vehicle affairs, and the waste of empty vehicles has also been avoided.

    At present, there is a great lack of short-distance transportation capacity in the city, and freight is very high, which is the case in most large cities. After the implementation of the new method, the transportation capacity used for intra-city grain transportation each month can be reduced by nearly 30%. At the same time, because irrational transportation phenomena such as opposite directions and roundabout routes are eliminated, it is also of great benefit to maintaining traffic order in the city.

    Since November 1954, the Beijing Grain Bureau has universally implemented this method throughout the city. This method can also be imitated in other cities. Not only is this method applicable to the transportation and allocation of grain, but department stores, retail companies, and consumer cooperatives can also try it.

### 改进市内粮食运输工作

    改进市内粮食运输工作
    马珍
    北京市所需要的粮食主要是从外地调入的，市内的粮食运输部门，一向认为只有做好接收工作才是分内的任务；对于市内调运，则认为：供应工作由经营部门管理，运输力由运输公司调配，运费由货主负担，都不是自己的工作范围以内的事。因此，很少注意市内运输上的合理或不合理的问题。
    实行粮食统购统销以后，情况就大大不同了。按照规定，市内的调运，运力的分配，运费的支出，都由调运部门负责。这样一来，很快就暴露出了在市内粮食运输工作中的缺点；同时也发现了在粮食储存工作中，只照顾到了保管的方便，忽略了供应上的分布平衡（如玉米只存在东郊一个仓库）。车等磅、磅等车的窝工浪费现象十分严重，并且经常发生迂回、倒流等不合理的现象。如海淀区合作社到东郊仓库提取白玉米八万斤，要比从西直门仓库提去多开支运费一百一十多元；有的合作社今天把代购的粮食送到仓库，明天又要办手续提取。这不但浪费了运输力，浪费了运费，也增加了仓库人员不必要的事务工作。特别是小杂粮，每个代销单位销量不大，但普遍需要，由于品种分配不平衡，不断出现“挨门拜年”、“散花灯”的迂回运输的现象。
    为了改变以往的情况，北京市粮食局的运输部门提出了“定库定点”的合理运输办法。这办法是：以仓库为中心，按照仓库的容量和出库能力，供应的需要（包括人口数目和所需品种、等级），加工厂和代销单位的分布情况等，合理地划分供应区域，一定的仓库负责供应一定范围内的代销单位。由外地调入的粮食，根据各库供应任务和供应规律，按品种、数量有计划地分拨到各库。储备粮则摆在离城区较远的仓库；要选择最短的运输路线，进行合理的调剂；要尽量做到每个仓库储存的品种齐全，数量充裕，不使这个区域内的代销单位再到别的区域的仓库去提取。
    从一九五四年八月份起，他们先以永定门仓库为中心，在前门区试验了这个办法。他们绘制了地图，把零售公司、合作社和代销店分别类型，用不同的颜色符号，标明距离仓库的里程，给直线运输指出了合理的方向。然后，由销粮单位提出需粮计划，交给仓库按计划配车，把粮食直接送到销售点。同时实行了统一计划、统一托运和统一支付运费的办法（由银行划拨）；并规定了定期提取粮食和定期配拨小杂粮的制度。把各单位提粮日期、时间、品种、数量也都详细排列出来，以便仓库按计划做好准备工作。
    过去，市内供应粮的运输是没有计划的，什么时候需要就什么时候提，各方面都很被动。实行这个办法以后，市内粮食的运输工作走上了计划的轨道。不但解决了仓库人员忙闲不均的问题，并且给仓库人员实行工作定额提供了有利条件，也使仓库能够合理地安排工作，为改善经营管理打下了基础。
    实行了新的办法，按照计划运输，加速了车辆的周转，缩短了车辆在路上的时间，提高了运输效率，节省了运费。如前门区合作社一九五四年七月份粮食运费平均每百斤是一角三分三厘七毫，实行新办法以后，八月份降低到每百斤一角零九厘八毫，每百斤粮食运费节省了二分三厘九毫。按八月份运量计算，共节省了运费三百五十多元。运输效率提高了百分之三十；运输部门在运费收入上平均每百斤比过去增加了六厘。
    实行了新的办法以后，加强了粮食工作部门同运输公司、零售公司、合作社的联系，改进了各方面的工作。提粮手续简化了，节省了许多时间；代销单位减少了要车事务，也避免了车辆放空的浪费现象。
    目前，市内短途运力很感缺乏，而且运费很高，一般大城市都是如此。实行新办法以后，每月市内粮食运输使用的运力可减少将近百分之三十；同时，因为消除了相向、迂回等不合理的运输现象，对于维持市内的交通秩序也有很大好处。
    从一九五四年十一月起，北京市粮食局已在全市普遍实行了这个办法。这个办法在别的城市也是可以仿行的。不只是粮食的运输调拨适用这个办法，百货公司、零售公司、消费合作社也可以试行。
