Heilongjiang to Reclaim Over Three Million Mu of Wasteland

Heilongjiang Province plans to reclaim 3.75 million mu of wasteland this summer, autumn, and next spring. Of this, agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams will expand production by reclaiming 2.25 million mu; state-owned mechanized farms, agricultural machinery stations, and the masses will reclaim 1.5 million mu for immigrants. After the implementation of this plan, the province can increase national soybean production by more than 250,000 tons annually; or increase corn production by 350,000 to 400,000 tons.

In order to ensure the smooth completion of the reclamation task, the state has invested 18 million yuan. By August 1st, more than 8 million yuan had been allocated for land reclamation and housing construction for immigrants, and 3,000 tons of soybean cake, 30,000 cubic meters of timber for housing construction, and other materials were distributed.

Currently, the people of the province have universally launched a surge of land reclamation and housing construction. In Nenjiang County, in addition to completing the expansion of production by cooperatives and teams by reclaiming 25,000 mu, the reclamation of 15,000 mu for immigrants has also been completed, and a request has been made to reclaim another 9,000 mu. Qing'an County has also organized an expeditionary land reclamation team, mobilizing more than 5,000 laborers, 3,500 head of livestock, and 479 plows, and dispatched a large number of staff, doctors, and veterinarians to assist in the land reclamation. Keshan, Nehe, and other places have begun to make adobe bricks, thatch grass, and transport timber to prepare for building houses for immigrants.

　  黑龙江将垦荒三百多万亩
    黑龙江省计划在今年夏秋和明年春季开垦荒地三百七十五万亩。其中农业生产合作社和互助组扩大生产垦荒二百二十五万亩；国营机械农场、农业机器站和群众为移民垦荒一百五十万亩。这个计划实现以后，全省每年可为国家增产大豆二十五万吨以上；或增产玉米三十五万吨至四十万吨。
    为了保证垦荒任务顺利完成，国家投资了一千八百万元。到八月一日已经拨出开荒费和为移民建房费等八百多万元，还发放豆饼三千吨，供应建房木材三万立方公尺以及其他物资。
    目前，全省人民已经普遍掀起了开荒建房的热潮。嫩江县除完成了社、组扩大生产开荒二万五千亩外，为移民开荒一万五千亩也全部完成，还要求再多开荒九千亩。庆安县还组织了远征开荒队，动员了五千多名劳动力、三千五百匹牲畜、四百七十九付犁，并派出大批工作人员、医生、兽医人员一同出发协助开荒。克山、讷河等地已开始拖坯、打苫草和运木材准备为移民建筑房屋。
