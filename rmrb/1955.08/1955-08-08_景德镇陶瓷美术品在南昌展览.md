    Jingdezhen Ceramic Art Exhibition in Nanchang
    The Jingdezhen Ceramic Art Exhibition of Jiangxi Province was held in Nanchang City from July 13th to 31st. During the exhibition, there were more than 56,000 visitors.
    This exhibition was jointly organized by the Jiangxi Provincial Cultural Bureau and Jingdezhen City, with a total of 2,300 ceramic artworks on display. The exhibits are divided into three parts: glaze, painting, and porcelain sculpture, all of which are new products from Jingdezhen in the past two years. They include export ceramics that participated in exhibitions in the Soviet Union and other democratic countries, gift ceramics that recently participated in the International Youth Festival, and daily-use ceramics that are being produced in large quantities. All the exhibits fully demonstrate the excellent historical traditions of Jingdezhen ceramic art in terms of modeling and color, and show the achievements of recovery and development in the past few years since liberation. For example, in the case of colored glaze, some precious colored glazes were lost during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. After liberation, through the cooperative research and active creation of ceramic workers, scientists, and art workers, not only were the lost colored glazes restored, but also the quality was greatly improved. For example, the sacrificial red, tea dust, Jun red, and Lang kiln red in the exhibits are delicate and lustrous, generally reaching historical levels, and some have exceeded historical levels.
    Among the exhibits, in terms of painting, works such as a twelve-inch round plate of pastel tea picking and butterfly catching and a three-hundred-piece plum vase of ancient colored lotus flowers appeared. Many famous paintings have also been depicted on various porcelains by ceramic artists. In terms of porcelain sculpture, there are also many works, and the coloring has been greatly improved compared to the past, with a wide range of themes and contents. Many works can generally use the characteristics of porcelain to express the laboring people's love for life and the happy life of various ethnic groups, such as "Statue of Qu Yuan," "Reading the Newspaper to Mom," and "Mongolian Man Hunting Wolf," which are all good works. Other small animals such as chickens, ducks, rabbits, and cats are also very lifelike.
    From this exhibition, it can be seen that Jingdezhen's ceramic art has made remarkable achievements since liberation and is moving forward with a new attitude towards a vigorous future. (Wan Kanguang)

    景德镇陶瓷美术品在南昌展览
    江西省景德镇陶瓷美术展览会，从七月十三日起至三十一日止，在南昌市举行。展出期间观众共五万六千多人。
    这个展览会是由江西省文化局和景德镇市联合举办的，共展出两千三百件陶瓷美术品。展品分釉彩、彩绘、瓷雕三部分，都是两年来景德镇的新出品，其中包括参加苏联和各民主国家展览的出国展览瓷，最近参加国际青年联欢节的礼品瓷，以及正在大量生产的日用瓷。全部展品在造型和色彩上，充分发挥了景德镇陶瓷美术优良的历史传统和显示了解放几年来恢复、发展的成绩。例如颜色釉，在国民党反动统治时期，有些名贵色釉都失传了，解放后经过陶瓷工人和科学、美术工作者的合作研究，积极创造，不仅使过去失传的颜色釉得到了恢复，而且在质量上都大有提高，如展品中的祭红、茶叶末、均红、郎窑红等，细腻光泽，一般都达到了历史水平，有的已超过了历史水平。
    展品中，在彩绘方面，出现了粉彩采茶扑蝶尺二圆盘、古彩荷花三百件梅瓶等作品，不少名画，也都被陶瓷艺人描绘在各种瓷器上。在瓷雕方面，作品也很不少，设色较前大大提高，题材内容相当广泛。许多作品对劳动人民热爱生活的情感和各兄弟民族愉快的生活，一般都能运用瓷器的特点来表现，如“屈原像”、“给妈妈读报”、“蒙古人打狼”等，都是较好的作品。其他如鸡、鸭、兔、猫等小动物，形态也都很生动。
    从这次展览会，可以看出景德镇的陶瓷美术在解放以来已取得了显著的成就，而且正在以新的姿态朝着蓬勃发展的前途迈进。　（万侃广）
