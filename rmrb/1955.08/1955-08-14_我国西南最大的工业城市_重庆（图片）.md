Chongqing: The Largest Industrial City in Southwest China
Chongqing, located at the confluence of the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers, is the largest industrial city in Southwest China. With the needs of industrial construction and the development of agriculture in the Southwest region, it has also become a distribution center for industrial and agricultural products in the Southwest. Our reporter Yuan Yiping took these photos.

    Along the banks of the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers, there are many large factories and mines. This is a certain open-hearth furnace in the newly built steelmaking workshop of the Southwest Iron and Steel Company, tapping steel. The Zhongliangshan coalfield, with its abundant reserves, is undergoing intensified exploration.
    The newly built weaving and dyeing mills of the 610 Factory have been put into production, playing a certain role in balancing the spinning, weaving, and dyeing production in the Southwest region. This is a corner of the dyeing mill.
    In order to meet the needs of industrial construction, Chongqing's municipal construction has also seen great development. The newly built ten roads, totaling twenty-seven kilometers in length, lead to various factories and hospitals, closely connecting the city and the suburbs.
    The mechanized Jiulongpo Wharf is loading and unloading machinery and construction materials, which are then directly transferred to various places by the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. Except where noted, the above photos were taken by Luo Ziguang, Tang Kuang, and Tong Jida of the Chongqing Daily.

    我国西南最大的工业城市——重庆
    重庆位于长江和嘉陵江的会合点，是我国西南最大的工业城市。随着工业建设的需要和西南地区农业的发展，这里又成为西南工农业产品集散的中心了。本报记者　袁毅平摄
    沿着长江和嘉陵江两岸有许多较大的工厂、矿山。这是西南钢铁公司新建的炼钢车间某号平炉正在出钢。蕴藏量丰富的中梁山煤田正在加紧勘探。
    六一○厂新建的织布场和印染场已投入生产，对平衡西南地区纺纱、织布和印染生产起了一定的作用。这是印染场的一角。
    为了适应工业建设的需要，重庆的市政建设也有很大发展。新修的十条共长二十七公里的公路，通向各个工厂和医院，把城市和郊区紧密地联系起来。
