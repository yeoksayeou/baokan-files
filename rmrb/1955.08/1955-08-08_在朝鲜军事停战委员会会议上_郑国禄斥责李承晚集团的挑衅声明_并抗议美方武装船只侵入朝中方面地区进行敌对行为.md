Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 7th: According to the Korean Central News Agency in Kaesong: The Military Armistice Commission held a meeting on the 6th. Senior Colonel Zheng Guolu, the chief member of the Korean-Chinese side, strongly condemned the provocative statement issued by the Lee Seung-man group on August 1st. In the statement, the Lee Seung-man group clamored to reoccupy the Kaesong, Ongjin, and other areas designated as part of the Korean-Chinese side according to the armistice agreement, and slandered and intimidated the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Senior Colonel Zheng Guolu said: The provocative statement issued by the Lee Seung-man group violates the unanimous desire of the Korean people to peacefully reunify their motherland. They attempt to endanger the Korean armistice, escalate international tensions, and reignite the Korean War. However, all these conspiracies and tricks are bound to meet with decisive failure.

At the same time, Senior Colonel Zheng Guolu lodged a serious protest with the U.S. side regarding the provocative incidents on July 22nd and 23rd, in which U.S. armed vessels violated the armistice agreement by intruding into the coastal area of the Korean-Chinese side north of the military demarcation line and engaging in hostile acts. Senior Colonel Zheng Guolu strongly demanded that the U.S. side severely punish those involved, take effective measures to ensure that such incidents do not occur again; and demanded that the U.S. side immediately return the peaceful residents of the Korean-Chinese side who were abducted by U.S. armed agents and the property that was looted to the Korean-Chinese side.

At the meeting, the U.S. representative, disregarding irrefutable facts, engaged in sophistry and denial, attempting to evade its serious responsibility for violating the armistice agreement, and refused to accept the list of Korean-Chinese fishermen abducted by the U.S. side presented by the Korean-Chinese side. Senior Colonel Zheng Guolu immediately pointed out at the meeting that the U.S. side must bear full responsibility for this serious violation of the armistice agreement and the creation of this provocative incident.

In his speech at the meeting, Senior Colonel Zheng Guolu said, regarding the course of the relevant incidents: At about 5:00 p.m. on July 22, 1955, two U.S. armed vessels intruded near Unmu Island in North Pyongan Province, attacked peaceful fishermen of the Korean-Chinese side who were fishing, and abducted three fishing boats and twenty fishermen from the Korean-Chinese side. At about 5:00 p.m. on July 23rd, one of these two U.S. armed vessels, "Pyongbuk No. 71," and Hong Yinghao and twenty-four other U.S. armed agents on board, were captured by the Korean-Chinese coast guard while escaping with eight peaceful Korean-Chinese fishermen. Another U.S. armed vessel abducted twelve peaceful Korean-Chinese fishermen and one fishing boat and fled towards Baengnyeong Island.

According to the unanimous confession of the U.S. armed agents captured by the Korean-Chinese side, they are armed agents of the 702nd District Team of the Western Intelligence Unit of the Lee Seung-man puppet army intelligence team. On July 21st, they directly received orders from Kang Yao-seop, the captain of this district team, and Major Meyer and Captain Daniel of the U.S. Army, advisors, to board armed vessels and intrude into the coastal area of the Korean-Chinese side to engage in hostile acts such as abducting fishermen. These agents also confessed that from September of last year to the end of June this year, they had intruded into the coastal areas of Sindo, Deokdo, and Chodo in North Pyongan Province and South Pyongan Province of the Korean-Chinese side seven times, abducting six fishing boats and fifty-five fishermen from the Korean-Chinese side, including seven fishermen from the People's Republic of China.

    在朝鲜军事停战委员会会议上
    郑国禄斥责李承晚集团的挑衅声明
    并抗议美方武装船只侵入朝中方面地区进行敌对行为
    新华社平壤七日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：军事停战委员会在六日举行会议。朝中方面首席委员郑国禄少将在会上斥责了李承晚集团在八月一日发表的挑衅性的声明。李承晚集团在声明中叫嚣要重新强占根据停战协定划入朝中方面地区的开城、瓮津等地区并且对中立国监察委员会进行诬蔑和恫吓。郑国禄少将说：李承晚集团发表的挑衅性声明是违反朝鲜人民渴望和平统一祖国的一致愿望的，他们企图危害朝鲜停战，加剧国际紧张局势，重新挑起朝鲜战争。但是这一切的阴谋诡计，必然要遭到决定性的失败。
    同时，郑国禄少将就七月二十二、二十三两日美方武装船只违反停战协定，侵入军事分界线以北朝中方面沿海地区，进行敌对行为的挑衅事件，向美方提出严重抗议。郑国禄少将强硬要求美方严惩有关人员，采取有效措施保证此类事件不再发生；并且要求美方立即将被美方武装特务劫走的朝中方面的和平居民和掠去的财物交还朝中方面。
    美方代表在会上不顾无可辩驳的事实，进行诡辩和抵赖，企图逃避它违反停战协定的严重责任，并且拒不接受朝中方面提出的被美方劫去的朝中方面渔民的名单。郑国禄少将在会上当即指出：美方必须承担这次严重违反停战协定制造这次挑衅事件的全部责任。
    郑国禄少将在会上的发言中谈到有关事件的经过时说：一九五五年七月二十二日下午五时许，美方武装船只二艘侵入平安北道云雾岛附近，袭击正在捕鱼的朝中方面的和平渔民，劫走了朝中方面三只渔船和船上的二十名渔民。七月二十三日下午五时许，这两艘美方武装船只中的一艘“平北七一号”和这条船上的洪应镐等二十四名美方武装特务在劫持着八名朝中方面和平渔民逃走时被朝中方面的海岸警备队所捕获。另一艘美方武装船只劫持着十二名朝中方面和平渔民和一只渔船向白翎岛方向逃去。
    据上述被朝中方面捕获的美方武装特务一致供称，他们是李承晚伪陆军谍报队西部谍报队第七零二地区队的武装特务，他们在七月二十一日直接奉到这个地区队的队长姜尧燮和顾问美国陆军少校梅伊尔和美军上尉丹尼尔的命令，乘坐武装船只侵入朝中方面沿海，进行劫持渔民等敌对行为。这些特务又供称：他们从去年九月到今年六月底前后七次侵入朝中方面平安北道、平安南道的沿海薪岛、德岛、椒岛等地，劫走朝中方面渔船六只、渔民五十五人，其中包括中华人民共和国渔民七人。
