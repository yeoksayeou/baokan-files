    New Soldiers in the "Steel Red Second Company"

    This spring, newly enlisted soldiers arrived at the nationally renowned heroic company – the "Steel Red Second Company."

    The "Steel Red Second Company" is one of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's oldest companies, organized by Chairman Mao during the Autumn Harvest Uprising in Hunan. The Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, personally formulated by Chairman Mao, were first implemented in this company. This company has created immense glory in its twenty-eight years of combat history. It was already known as the Iron Company during the campaigns to crush the five encirclements in the Jiangxi Central Soviet. During the Long March, this unit was also the vanguard that broke through the natural barrier of the Wu River and seized the Luding Bridge. After arriving in northern Shaanxi, they were praised as a "Comprehensive Model Company," and later, during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, they were named the "Steel Red Second Company."

    As soon as the new soldiers arrived at this company, they were attracted by the twenty or thirty banners in the club. Company Commander Gong Wanchang told the new soldiers about the history of the company, which made them very excited and inspired. Zhang Demao, a new soldier from Hunan, said, "When I was a child, I heard old people tell stories about Chairman Mao and the Red Army. I wanted to be a Red Army soldier when I grew up. Now I really am a soldier in this old Red Army company, and I feel indescribably excited!" The new soldiers quickly became familiar with the history of their company, and they often talked about the famous battles their company had participated in. They all had a common idea in their minds: to train themselves to be like the old Red Army soldiers, to defend the fruits of victory won by the old Red Army's bloody struggle, and to defend socialist construction.

    Encouraged by the honor of the unit, the new soldiers are studying their skills diligently. They crawl on the ground aiming, or run in the field doing combat exercises. The new soldiers also use the early morning, evening, or rest time outside of drills to learn military skills with the help of the veteran soldiers. New soldier Wei Chengjin studied diligently and practiced hard with the help of the veteran soldiers, and achieved excellent results in live ammunition shooting, and is now the company's light machine gun deputy shooter.

    The new soldiers are progressing rapidly with the help of the veteran soldiers and officers. Three new soldiers have already joined the Communist Youth League, and probationary party member Wei Jiankang has also been converted into a full party member. Many new soldiers are actively applying to join the League. Two new soldiers have received commendations from the regimental and battalion leaders. Some of the new soldiers who were originally illiterate can now write articles for the wall newspaper.

    The new soldiers' lives are very pleasant. After each day's drills, they engage in plenty of recreational and sports activities. Many of the new soldiers have joined the company's basketball team, singing team, band, and broadcast reading group. In the woods, you can often hear the songs of the new soldiers and the accompaniment of the accordion.

    新战士在“钢铁红二连”
    刘文韶
    今年春天应征入伍的新战士们来到了全国著名的英雄连队——“钢铁红二连”。
      “钢铁红二连”是中国人民解放军中历史悠久的连队之一，是毛主席在湖南秋收起义中组织起来的部队。毛主席亲手制定的三大纪律、八项注意也首先在这个连队中开始执行。这个连队在自己二十八年的战斗历史中创造了极大的光荣。在江西中央根据地粉碎五次围剿中就被称为铁连。在长征中，这一支部队又是突破乌江天险，飞夺泸定桥的先锋。到达陕北后，他们被誉为“全面模范连”，后来在抗日战争和解放战争中又被命名为“钢铁红二连”。
    新战士们刚来到这个连队，就被俱乐部里的二、三十面锦旗吸引住了。连长宫万昌向新战士们讲述了连队的历史，使新战士们非常兴奋和激动。湖南来的新战士张德茂说：“我小时候就听老人讲过毛主席和红军的故事，我就想长大了当个红军战士。现在我真的就是这个老红军连队的战士了，真有说不出的兴奋！”新战士们很快就熟悉了本连队的历史，他们常常谈论自己连队参加过的著名战斗。他们的心里都有一个共同的想法：要把自己锻炼得像老红军战士那样，保卫老红军流血奋斗所取得的胜利果实，保卫社会主义建设。
    在部队荣誉的鼓舞下，新战士们紧张地学习着本领。他们匍匐在地下瞄准，或奔跑在野外做战斗演习。新战士们还利用清早、傍晚或操课以外的休息时间，在老战士们的帮助下来学习军事技术。新战士韦成金在老战士们的帮助下勤学苦练，在实弹射击中取得了优秀的成绩，现在已经成为连里的轻机枪副射手了。
    新战士们在老战士和军官的帮助下进步得很快。有三名新战士已经加入了青年团，候补党员魏健康也已经转为正式党员了。还有不少新战士正在积极要求入团。有两名新战士受到了团、营首长的嘉奖。原来是文盲的新战士，有的已经能给墙报写稿了。
    新战士们的生活是非常愉快的。每天操课之后，他们都进行充分的文娱体育活动。不少的新战士参加了连的篮球队、歌咏队、乐队、广播读报小组。在树林里，还常常可以听到新战士们的歌声和伴奏的手风琴声。
