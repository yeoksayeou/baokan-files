    PLA Anti-Malaria Team on the Yunnan Border Helps People in Over Fifty Counties Prevent and Control Malaria
    A Chinese People's Liberation Army anti-malaria team, active on the Yunnan border, has been helping people of all ethnic groups in more than fifty counties to carry out malaria prevention and control work for the past two years.
    The anti-malaria team members often carry medicine kits, conduct physical examinations for ethnic minority people in villages, administer medicine to them for prevention, and spray insecticides to kill mosquitoes. The area sprayed with insecticides by the team members in various villages and settlements is more than 2.7 million square meters; a total of 150,000 person-times have received treatment or prevention.
    In order not to affect farmers' production, the anti-malaria team members mostly carry out prevention and control work at dawn or dusk. During the day, some anti-malaria team members personally deliver boiled water and medicine to the fields. In the mountainous areas, the anti-malaria team's "mobile health peddlers" often move from one hilltop to another, going wherever there are patients. Whenever there is a market, they set up medicine stalls on the street to provide free treatment.
    Thanks to the active prevention and treatment by the anti-malaria team and local health authorities, the incidence of malaria has decreased significantly in many places. In Simao, where malaria used to be most prevalent, the incidence has dropped to 7% of what it used to be. Shuangjiang County, formerly known as a "highly malarial area," now rarely sees people getting sick during the malaria season. A Dai folk song praises this new scene: "In the past, we lay in bed when the rice turned yellow; this year, we are busy harvesting when the rice turns yellow." (Xinhua News Agency)

    在云南边疆的解放军抗疟队  帮助五十多县人民防治疟疾
    活跃在云南边疆的一支中国人民解放军抗疟队，两年来在五十多个县内帮助各族人民进行了疟疾防治工作。
    抗疟队员们经常带着药包，在村寨里逐户为少数民族人民进行体格检查、给他们服药预防和喷射杀虫剂灭蚊。队员们在各村寨喷射的杀虫药剂面积有二百七十多万平方公尺；受到治疗或预防的共十五万人次。
    为了不影响农民生产，抗疟队员们的防治工作大都在黎明或黄昏进行。在白天，有的抗疟队员把开水和药亲自送到田里。在山区，抗疟队的“流动卫生货郎担”经常从一个山头转到另一山头，哪里有病人就到哪里去。每逢赶集时，他们就在街上摆开药摊，进行免费治疗。
    经过抗疟队和地方卫生机关的积极防治，很多地方的疟疾发病率有显著下降。以前疟疾流行最重的思茅，发病率已经下降为以前的百分之七。以前被称为“高度疟区”的双江县，现在疟疾流行的季节里也很少有人生病了。傣族农民在一首民歌里歌颂这种新景象说：“往年谷黄床上躺，今年谷黄收割忙。”　（新华社）
