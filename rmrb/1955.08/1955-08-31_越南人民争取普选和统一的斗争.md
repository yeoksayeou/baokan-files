　　The Vietnamese People's Struggle for Universal Suffrage and Unification
　　Chen Ruhou
    In welcoming the glorious festival of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the struggle of the people in both North and South Vietnam to demand a North-South consultative conference and to realize free universal suffrage throughout Vietnam is rising day by day. This struggle demonstrates the unwavering determination of the Vietnamese people to thoroughly implement the Geneva Accords, consolidate peace, achieve unification, and ensure the completion of independence and democracy throughout the country.
    The various ethnic groups of Vietnam established a unified country thousands of years ago. On the fertile land stretching over three thousand miles from north to south, the heroic and hardworking Vietnamese people, through generations of common labor and struggle, established unified political, economic, and cultural systems, and a common social life. They once broke the separatist situation of some feudal rulers who divided the motherland in history, and defeated the French colonialists' vicious policy of implementing the so-called "three-ky division" in an attempt to undermine Vietnam's unification. Ten years ago, in the glorious August General Uprising, the Vietnamese people finally re-established an independent and unified country, and then carried out an eight-year heroic war of resistance to defend their national sovereignty, achieving the great victory of the Geneva Accords.
    The Geneva Accords confirmed the national aspirations of the Vietnamese people for peace, independence, unification, and territorial integrity. The final declaration of the Geneva Conference emphasized that the military demarcation line set up to facilitate the cessation of hostilities and the regrouping of military forces "is a provisional line and cannot in any way be interpreted as a political or territorial boundary," and stipulated that Vietnam's unification should be achieved through free universal suffrage throughout Vietnam in July 1956.
    In order to realize this extremely important political clause, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the entire Vietnamese people are carrying out unremitting struggles.
    On February 4th this year, the Council of Ministers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement proposing to restore normal relations between the North and South regions, so that people can freely move, communicate, and conduct economic and cultural exchanges, so as to facilitate people's return to normal life and prepare conditions for the realization of national universal suffrage and unification. Subsequently, the Propaganda Department, the Ministry of Transportation and Public Works, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the State Bank of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam successively announced specific measures to facilitate people's free movement, commerce, and communication. These measures have been warmly supported by people from all walks of life in North and South Vietnam.
    Despite the Southern authorities' unreasonable rejection of the proposal to restore normal relations between the North and South, and the adoption of terrorist measures to prevent the people of the South and the people of the North from interacting with each other, the people of the North and South still managed to break through various obstacles and carry out mutual visits. Thousands of entrepreneurs and merchants from South Vietnam came to the North to exchange goods and sign trade contracts, and more than eighty kinds of goods have been exchanged between the North and South regions. The postal delegations of the North and South reached an agreement on mailing ordinary postcards and exchanged tens of thousands of mails. This shows that the natural connection between the people of North and South Vietnam is inseparable by any force.
    Since June this year, after the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam repeatedly proposed to hold consultative conferences to discuss the issue of universal suffrage in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords, the people of the whole country of Vietnam have widely launched a mass patriotic movement, resolutely supporting the proposition of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and urging the Southern authorities to accept the proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    Huang Quoc Viet, Chairman of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, once pointed out: "Vietnam is a unified whole from Muc Nam Quan to Ca Mau Cape. Our history, culture, language, and blood are the same, and cannot be divided by anyone." This is the common will of the Vietnamese working class. The vast number of Vietnamese peasants also widely expressed this strong national aspiration. Van Te Gioi, a model agricultural worker in the suburbs of Hanoi, said: "The fields from North Vietnam to South Vietnam are planted with golden rice; producing large white rice; eating the same food, speaking the same language; the whole land is connected together, it has been like this since ancient times, and no one can divide our country!" Combined with the powerful forces of workers and peasants, people from all walks of life, different professions, and different religious beliefs in Vietnam unanimously demanded universal suffrage and unification. Literary, scientific, and educational workers, in order to develop national culture and exchange each other's experiences and opinions, are eager for the early realization of unification. The resolution of the Hanoi Industrial and Commercial Conference pointed out: "Only when the motherland is unified can capitalists have sufficient conditions to develop and operate industry and commerce." The people of the ethnic minorities in the Central Highlands meaningfully said: "Vietnam is like a big tree, its roots, stems, branches, and leaves are inseparable."
    The Ngo Dinh Diem regime, with the support of the United States, continues to stubbornly refuse to negotiate on universal suffrage. This perverse act of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has aroused the anger and resistance of the entire Vietnamese people.
    The National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front, various democratic parties, and people's organizations issued a joint statement, unanimously supporting the note of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on holding consultative conferences, and condemning the Ngo Dinh Diem regime's attempt to evade the obligations of the Geneva Accords. Representatives of various political parties, people's organizations, religions, and ethnic groups in Vietnam also formed the Unified Movement Committee of the Vietnam National United Front to promote the struggle of the entire Vietnamese people for universal suffrage and unification. In large and small cities, villages, factories, enterprises, institutions, and schools throughout North Vietnam, mass movements demanding universal suffrage and unification have been widely launched. Mass rallies attended by thousands and tens of thousands of people are held everywhere, making resolutions and issuing petitions, resolutely opposing the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's attempt to obstruct universal suffrage, and demanding that it immediately hold consultative conferences with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Workers in various parts of North Vietnam have also launched patriotic emulation movements to consolidate North Vietnam as a base for the struggle for unification. Farmers in many areas of North Vietnam have also put forward proposals to support the movement for unification with actions such as increasing production, actively participating in the land reform movement, and striving to prevent natural disasters. "Demanding consultative universal suffrage with practical actions" has become the current battle cry of the working people of North Vietnam.
    The struggle of the people in various places under the rule of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to demand consultative universal suffrage has also been widely launched. On July 3, the people of Saigon, despite the suppression by the Ngo Dinh Diem military police, held demonstrations demanding that the Southern authorities hold consultations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to arrange universal suffrage. On July 10, the people of Saigon held strikes and walkouts for this purpose. People from all walks of life in many large towns in the South, such as Long Xuyen, Chau Doc, Ca Mau, Qui Nhon, Tourane, and Hue, held rallies and issued petitions, demanding that consultative conferences be held.
    The widespread struggle of the people of South Vietnam to demand consultative universal suffrage has put the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in an unprecedentedly isolated position. An article in the French "International Forum" on August 5, in describing how the people of Saigon bravely altered the reactionary slogans written on the walls by the Ngo Dinh Diem elements, said: "The people of Saigon have won a victory in opposing Ngo Dinh Diem's propaganda." This publication also pointed out that Ngo Dinh Diem has made "foreign and domestic residents, civil servants, and refugees protest against him unanimously, and even among those who usually support Ngo Dinh Diem, some people condemn him."
    Some Saigon newspapers controlled by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique cannot but reflect some of the South Vietnamese people's will to unify to some extent. The Saigon "Dawn Newspaper" once wrote: All the people of North Vietnam, Central Vietnam, and South Vietnam are eager to hold universal suffrage, because this will realize the peaceful unification of the country. This South Vietnamese newspaper also acknowledged: The statement of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam demanding consultative conferences is "completely consistent with the Geneva Accords and with the people's desire for unification." Another Saigon newspaper, "The Bell," also pointed out: "The people's will to unify is as strong as steel."
    Recently, even former Bao Dai government Premier Tran Van Huu and former South Vietnamese Army Chief of Staff Nguyen Van Hinh have issued statements endorsing North-South consultation for peaceful reunification through universal suffrage. Pham Van Giao, secretary-general of the South Vietnamese Socialist Party, also condemned Ngo Dinh Diem's attempt to renege on the Geneva Accords.
    The calls for unification from the people of all walks of life in Vietnam, from north to south, and their increasingly widespread struggle, thoroughly expose the shameful excuses and various disguises of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique and its foreign supporters in obstructing consultative universal suffrage. The Vietnamese people clearly see that the purpose of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique and its foreign supporters in obstructing universal suffrage is to undermine the Geneva Accords, create division and hostility in Vietnam, and use South Vietnam as a military base to provoke new wars. This international conspiracy is not tolerated by the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people are strengthening national unity, promoting contacts between the North and South regions, and persisting in the struggle for the full implementation of the Geneva Accords and the realization of national unification.

### 越南人民争取普选和统一的斗争

　　越南人民争取普选和统一的斗争
　　陈汝厚
    在迎接越南民主共和国成立十周年这一光辉节日的时候，越南北方和南方各地人民要求举行南北协商会议，实现全越自由普选的斗争，日益高涨起来。这种斗争，表现了越南人民要求彻底履行日内瓦协议、巩固和平、实现统一和保证全国完成独立和民主的不可动摇的决心。
    越南各族人民在千年以前就建立了统一的国家。在南北延绵三千多里的富饶土地上，英勇勤劳的越南人民通过世世代代的共同的劳动和斗争，建立了统一的政治、经济、文化和共同的社会生活。他们曾经打破了历史上某些封建统治者分裂祖国的割据局面，击败了法国殖民者实行所谓“三圻分治”以图破坏越南统一的恶毒政策。十年以前，越南人民终于在光辉的八月总起义中，重新建立了独立的、统一的国家，随后又为捍卫自己的民族主权进行了八年的英勇抗战，取得了日内瓦协议的伟大胜利。
    日内瓦协议确认了越南人民争取和平、独立、统一和领土完整的民族愿望。日内瓦会议最后宣言强调说，为了便于停战和集结军事部队而设置的军事分界线，“是临时性的界线，无论如何不能被解释为政治的或领土的边界”，并规定要在一九五六年七月内通过全越的自由普选来实现越南的统一。
    为了实现这一极关重要的政治条款，越南民主共和国政府和全越南人民进行着不懈的斗争。
    今年二月四日，越南民主共和国部长会议发表声明，建议恢复南北地区之间的正常关系，使人民可以自由地迁徙、通信和进行经济、文化交流等活动，以便利人民恢复正常生活，并为实现全国普选和统一准备条件。随后，越南民主共和国政府的宣传部、交通公政部、工商部和国家银行等部门，又相继公布了具体办法，以便利人民自由来往和通商、通信等。这些措施得到了北越和南越各阶层人民的热烈拥护。
    尽管南越当局无理地拒绝了恢复南北正常关系的建议，并采取恐怖措施来阻止南方人民和北方人民相互来往，但是，南北地区人民仍设法冲破种种阻碍，进行着相互的探视和访问。数以千计的企业家和商人从南越到北部来交换货物和签订贸易合同，南北地区之间已经交流了八十多种商品。南北双方的邮政代表团并达成了关于邮寄家常明信片的协议，互相投递了数以万计的邮件。这说明了越南南北人民相互之间的血肉相连的自然联系，是任何势力所隔绝不了的。
    今年六月以来，在越南民主共和国政府一再提出要求按照日内瓦协定的规定举行讨论普选问题的协商会议的建议之后，越南全国人民广泛地展开了群众性的爱国运动，坚决拥护越南民主共和国政府的主张，并敦促南方当局接受越南民主共和国的建议。
    越南总工会主席黄国越曾指出：“越南从睦南关到金瓯角是一个统一的整体。我们的历史、文化、语言、血统是同一的，是任何人都不能加以分割的。”这是越南工人阶级的共同意志。越南广大农民也广泛地表示了这个强烈的民族愿望。河内郊区农业劳动模范文济世说：“自北越到南越的田野都是种着金黄色的稻；出产大白米；吃着同样的东西，讲着同样的语言；整个大地联结在一起，自古以来都是这样，不论任何人都不能分裂我们的国土！”在南越，连美国“纽约先驱论坛报”也承认，南越“农民反对吴庭艳政权，要求举行日内瓦协定所规定的普选”。同强大的工人、农民的力量结合在一起，越南各阶层、各种不同职业、不同宗教信仰的人们，都一致地要求举行普选，实现统一。文艺、科学、教育工作者们为了发展民族文化，互相交换彼此的经验和意见，都渴望着统一的早日实现。河内工商业家会议的决议指出：“只有祖国统一，资本家才有充分的条件来发展和经营工商业。”西原少数民族人民意味深长地说：“越南好比一颗大树，它的根、茎、枝叶是不可分离的。”
    吴庭艳政权在美国的支持下继续横蛮拒绝协商普选。吴庭艳集团的这种倒行逆施的行为，激起了全越人民的愤怒和反抗。
    越南国民联合战线全国委员会、各民主党派和人民团体发表了联合声明，一致支持越南民主共和国政府关于举行协商会议的照会，谴责吴庭艳政权企图逃避日内瓦协议的义务的行动。越南各政党、各人民团体和各宗教、各民族的代表并组成了越南民族统一战线统一运动委员会，以推动全越南人民争取普选和统一的斗争。北越各地的大小城市、乡村和工厂、企业、机关、学校等处，普遍地开展了要求普选和统一的群众运动。到处举行着成千成万人参加的群众大会，作出决议，发出请愿书，坚决反对吴庭艳集团阻挠普选的企图，要求它立即和越南民主共和国政府举行协商会议。北越各地的工人并为此而开展了爱国竞赛运动，以巩固北越作为争取统一斗争的基地。北越许多地区的农民，也纷纷提出要以增加生产、积极参加土地改革运动、努力防止天灾等行动来支持争取统一的运动。“以实际行动要求协商普选”，已成为北越劳动人民当前的战斗口号。
    在吴庭艳集团统治下的各地人民要求协商普选的斗争，也广泛地开展起来。七月三日，西贡人民不顾吴庭艳军警的镇压，举行了示威游行，要求南越当局同越南民主共和国举行协商安排普选。七月十日，西贡人民并为此举行了罢市、罢工。在龙川、朱笃、金瓯、归仁、土伦、顺化等许多南方大城镇的各阶层人民，纷纷举行集会和发出请愿书，要求举行协商会议。
    南越人民要求协商普选的广泛斗争，使吴庭艳集团陷于空前的孤立地位。法国“国际论坛”八月五日的一篇文章中，在叙述西贡人民怎样英勇地涂改吴庭艳分子在墙上写下的反动标语时说：“西贡人民已经在反对吴庭艳的宣传上打了一次胜仗。”这个刊物还指出，吴庭艳已使得“外国和本国居民、公务员和难民们对他一致抗议，甚至在通常支持吴庭艳的人当中也有人谴责他”。
    吴庭艳集团控制下的某些西贡报纸，也不能不多少地反映一些南越人民要求统一的意志。西贡
  “曙光报”就曾写道：北越、中越和南越的全体人民都渴望举行普选，因为这将实现国家的和平统
  一。这个南越报纸并承认：越南民主共和国政府要求举行协商会议的声明，是“同日内瓦协定、同人民要求统一的愿望十分一致的”。另一家西贡报纸
  “钟声报”也指出：“人民要求统一的意志像钢铁般坚强。”
    最近，甚至前保大政府的总理陈文友、前南越陆军参谋长阮文馨，也都发表声明，赞成南北双方举行协商会议，以便通过普选和平统一国家。南越社会党总书记范文约，也指责吴庭艳想赖掉日内瓦协定的企图。
    从北到南，从越南各阶层人民中发出的要求统一的呼声，他们日益广泛地展开的斗争，彻底地揭穿了吴庭艳集团和它的外国支持者阻挠协商普选的可耻借口和种种伪装。越南人民清楚地看到：吴庭艳集团及其外国支持者阻挠普选的目的，是想破坏日内瓦协议，制造越南的分裂和敌对，把南越作为挑起新战争的军事基地。这个国际阴谋是越南人民不能容许的。越南人民正在加强民族团结，促进南北地区间的联系，坚持争取全部实施日内瓦协议、实现国家统一的斗争。
