The Evil Consequences of Dalian Steel Plant Adopting Capitalist Management Methods
Zhou Zuoxin, Yang Huiyi

Over the past few years, the Dalian Steel Plant of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, in implementing the national plan, has adopted serious capitalist management methods, causing huge losses to the country.

One of the specific manifestations of the capitalist management thinking of the leading staff of Dalian Steel Plant is that they only care about completing the output target one-sidedly, disregarding the variety plan, and lack a spirit of cooperation in coordinating with other brother factories and mines and construction units. The plant often uses methods such as overestimating labor and materials and delaying delivery dates to refuse orders from brother factories in disguise. Last year, a certain factory requested the plant to trial-produce a new product and requested continued supply, but they insisted on emphasizing technical difficulties, saying that they "only manage trial production, not supply." Only after criticism from the CPC Lüda Municipal Committee did they correct their mistake. Some units asked them for assistance in manufacturing special steel, and although they agreed, they always paid more attention to the price. The Lüda Transportation Company cast two high-manganese steel turnout frogs at the plant, and the price they asked was ten times higher than ordinary high-manganese steel.

Even after accepting an order, they often only care about completing their own output figures, putting the order aside and failing to deliver it on the date stipulated in the contract. The order that the plant accepted from Qingdao Textile Factory was delayed for 353 days; the flat steel ordered by the First Automobile Factory and the Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory, which was agreed to be delivered in December last year and January this year, had not been fully delivered until June. Failure to deliver on time has caused great losses to various brother enterprises. When Jixi Mining Machinery Factory manufactured the "Donbass Type 1" combined coal mining machine, because the nickel-chromium steel ordered from Dalian Steel Plant was not available, some parts had to be replaced with rough materials, which affected the quality of the machine. Another factory wrote in a letter of protest: "Because your factory failed to deliver on time... causing our factory to stop production... this has become the key to whether our factory can complete this year's production task." Due to Dalian Steel Plant's failure to deliver on time, the production plans of many factories and mines have been disrupted.

Are there some technical problems that cannot be solved, preventing them from delivering on time? No. The orders accepted by the plant are also incorporated into the work plan, but never has there been a month in which production has been carried out seriously according to the work plan, and they even intentionally fail to complete the order plan. When the steelmaking workshop is making steel, if it finds that the carbon is high, it does not decarbonize it, but changes it to "high-carbon steel," and if it finds that the carbon is low, it changes it to "low-carbon steel." The production in the plant is so chaotic that the workshop can refuse to produce according to the production plan at will. In October last year, there was an order for spring steel, which required high technical conditions, so Ma Chenggong, the director of the rolling mill workshop, ordered the workers to stop production and told the production section: "Don't accept such difficult work in the future!" Similar situations of "free" production have become commonplace in the plant. Especially at the end of the month, seeing that it is still far from completing the plan, the workshop randomly does whatever is easy to do, as long as the tonnage is exceeded. In July last year, the amount of a certain type of steel that should have been produced was 5,000 kilograms short, while the amount that did not need to be produced was overproduced by 111,600 kilograms. As a result, on the one hand, there are large amounts of outstanding deliveries, and on the other hand, there are large amounts of stockpiles. The plant has received more than 2,000 letters of protest from January last year to the present, protesting their failure to deliver on time. However, the leading staff of Dalian Steel Plant avoid giving direct answers to these protests, and always say irrelevant things such as "force majeure" and "limited by technical conditions," etc., and even print a large number of official letters stating the reasons for delayed delivery in advance, in an attempt to evade the other party's fines.

Another manifestation of the capitalist management thinking of Dalian Steel Plant is that it only cares about completing the output target, regardless of the massive waste of state funds.

The plant's cost overrun last year reached more than 1.6 million yuan, and in the first quarter of this year, it exceeded the plan by another 880,000 yuan. Due to the serious phenomenon of wasting funds, the plant borrowed 6.4 million yuan from the bank last year, and paid 430,000 yuan in interest alone.

Last year, factory director Yuan Zhizhong put forward the slogan of "vigorously supporting steelmaking," requiring other departments to serve the steelmaking department unconditionally and at all costs. Whoever fails to serve well will be criticized by the factory director. As a result, the already chaotic supply department became even more chaotic, purchasing large quantities of materials and stockpiling them in large quantities. The steel wire workshop needs heavy diesel oil. The workshop requested 30 tons, and the supply section immediately ordered 150 tons, but only 7 tons were actually used. When the steelmaking workshop is making steel, if it finds that the carbon is low, it casually takes some from the pile of cast iron in the supply section and puts it into the furnace. The supply section not only does not stop it when it sees it, but also transports the cast iron to the entrance of the workshop and asks them to take it as they please. As a result, each furnace of steel in the steelmaking workshop puts in 100 kilograms or even one ton more steel material than the quota. In the first quarter of this year alone, about 1,000 tons more scrap steel was used. The plant's annual need for tool steel is about 250 tons, which should have been general carbon steel, but they also used high-quality steel instead, wasting 90,000 yuan on this item alone.

Dalian Steel Plant's pursuit of output seems to be only for the sake of having a figure to report, and no one pays attention to the finished products produced. Once, 960 kilograms of steel were produced, and when the user came to pick up the goods, they did not know where they were, so they had to bear the fine; when the batch of steel was found later, it was all rusted and turned into waste. Many steel materials of different specifications and types are mixed together, the bottom is not padded evenly, and the top is not covered tightly, and most of them are rusted and deteriorated. During a stocktaking last year, the shortage of finished products alone amounted to 490,000 yuan.

In pursuit of output, quality is also disregarded. Last year alone, the plant's defective and substandard products amounted to 3,558 tons. Producing defective and substandard products seems to have become a "legal" behavior in this factory. Last year, the steelmaking workshop had a total of 139 quality accidents and violated operating procedures more than 2,000 times. The leading staff of the factory never paid attention to investigating the responsibility for the accidents and improving product quality. The rebar produced by the rolling mill workshop was heavily stockpiled because it did not meet the needs, so it was decided to change the specifications. For this reason, the pass of the rolling mill needs to be changed. When designing the pass, there was a plan that could guarantee quality, but the efficiency was lower. Another plan had high production efficiency, but could not guarantee quality. They actually adopted the plan with high efficiency. As a result, the quality of the rebar produced was poor, and a large amount of stockpiling was caused again. The steel wire workshop produced more than 1,000 tons of iron wire raw materials, of which more than 300 tons were unqualified and had to be reprocessed, but the workshop workers received "extra rewards." Due to the poor quality of the products, the factory often received letters of protest from the user units. Last year, there were 367 cases, and from January to April this year, there were 201 cases.

The reason why Dalian Steel Plant has these problems is that factory director Yuan Zhizhong should bear the main responsibility. Yuan Zhizhong has serious bourgeois individualism. He came to Dalian Steel Plant in 1952. He did not have a very good understanding of the specific situation and business of Dalian Steel Plant, but he subjectively carried out a series of "reforms" in the steel plant, relying on his experience as the director of a textile factory and the deputy director of the office of the former Northeast Industrial Department. As a result, the factory after the "reforms" according to his intentions became even more chaotic. The poor quality of the plant is well known, but when others mention it, he immediately corrects them, saying: "It's not poor quality, but quality fluctuations." Once, a responsible comrade from the Industrial Department of the CPC Lüda Municipal Committee talked with him, pointing out that "Dalian Steel Plant has not made much progress in the past few years." He immediately argued: "It's not that it hasn't made much progress, but that the progress is slower."

But no matter what Yuan Zhizhong thinks, the fact that the factory cannot complete the national plan is an iron fact. Therefore, Yuan Zhizhong wanted to take shortcuts and engage in fraud. At a time when the country urgently needs steel, he intentionally draws up a conservative plan and tells the staff: "Don't draw up the plan too high. If we can't complete it, the higher-ups will spank us!" The 1954 plan was based on the backward quotas from January to August 1953. But even such a plan is difficult to complete, so he embarked on the "shortcut" of one-sidedly pursuing output. The aforementioned erroneous practices all occurred with the permission or even encouragement of Yuan Zhizhong, and some even occurred with the personal participation of Yuan Zhizhong. Previously, Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory had ordered spring steel from the plant, and the contract stipulated that it should be "relatively high precision." Once, the contract omitted this stipulation, so the workshop took the opportunity to produce according to "ordinary precision." When 14 tons had been produced, it was discovered by the technical supervision section, which suggested contacting the owner by telephone. Yuan Zhizhong said: "There is no need to contact them. If we contact them, all kinds of troubles will come!" The technical supervision section said: "What if they don't want it?" Yuan Zhizhong said: "The contract will speak for us!" As a result, 400 tons were produced, causing great trouble to the other party. In November last year, Dalian Steel Plant was criticized repeatedly by higher authorities and had to control "free production." Yuan Zhizhong personally issued an order: "Those who do not conform to the work plan for the current month shall not be put into storage." But in March this year, he ordered again: "Everything produced by the workshop shall be put into storage." As a result, the promotion section sold 40 tons of stockpiled steel in April, but 70 tons of products outside the plan were put into storage that month. Naturally, it was impossible to completely dispose of the stockpiles.

Yuan Zhizhong lacks the concept of relying on the Party and relying on the masses in his work. He one-sidedly emphasizes the system of one-man leadership and neglects Party supervision and democratic management. When deciding on major issues of the factory, he always acts arbitrarily and does not discuss them at the Party committee meeting. When preparing the plan last year, he submitted it without submitting it to the Party committee for discussion. When someone raised an opinion, he also said: "You don't understand. You can't offer any opinions even if you discuss it." Because Yuan Zhizhong belittles the role of the Party in the enterprise, there has been such an erroneous argument among the staff: "It doesn't matter if the branch closes its doors for a day, but if the administration closes its doors for a day, the plan cannot be completed." This means that many people already think that the Party organization in the enterprise is dispensable!

Naturally, many staff members of Dalian Steel Plant disagree with Yuan Zhizhong's approach and have suggested reversing the wrong management methods, but Yuan Zhizhong has rejected the criticisms and opinions of his comrades. In February this year, when Yuan Zhizhong went to Beijing, a meeting was held in the factory to study why the plan could not be completed according to variety. At that time, relevant personnel all made self-criticisms in accordance with the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session. Everyone was prepared to improve their work and was very confident. However, after Yuan Zhizhong returned to the factory and listened to the report, he was very angry and thought it was too "leftist." He also said: "How many times have there been inspections and criticisms in the past? Haven't the problems and shortcomings remained the same?" As a result, everyone's enthusiasm was suppressed by Yuan Zhizhong again.

Dalian Steel Plant has been dragged down by erroneous leadership thinking and cannot move forward! Recently, Yuan Zhizhong made a self-criticism at the Dalian Municipal Representative Conference of the Communist Party of China. Although the self-criticism was not profound enough, it at least initially showed a willingness to correct his mistakes. It is hoped that Yuan Zhizhong will earnestly show his determination in practical actions; at the same time, it is also hoped that the Ministry of Heavy Industry will strengthen its specific leadership and assistance to Dalian Steel Plant.

    大连钢厂采取资本主义经营方法的恶果
    周作新　杨会义
    重工业部大连钢厂几年来在执行国家计划中，采取严重的资本主义经营方法，给国家造成了巨大的损失。
    大连钢厂领导工作人员的资本主义经营思想的具体表现之一，就是只顾片面地完成产量任务，不顾品种计划，在同各兄弟厂矿、建设单位的配合中缺乏协作精神。该厂对待兄弟工厂的订货，常是以高估工料、推拖交货日期等办法，变相地拒绝订货。去年，某厂要求该厂试制一种新产品，并要求继续供应，但是他们一味强调技术困难，说是“只管试制、不管供应”，几经中共旅大市委批评，才纠正了错误的做法。某些单位要求他们在制造特殊钢材方面给以帮助，他们虽然答应，但总要在价钱方面多打点主意。旅大交通公司在该厂铸造两根高锰钢道岔子，他们要的价钱竟比一般高锰钢贵十倍。
    接受了订货之后，他们也常常是只顾去完成自己的产量数字，把订货抛到一边，不能按照合同规定日期交货。该厂承受的青岛纺织厂的订货，一拖就是三百五十三天；第一汽车厂、量具刃具厂订购的扁钢，商定在去年十二月和今年一月交货，但直到六月还没交齐。不按期交货，给各兄弟企业造成很大的损失。鸡西矿山机械厂制造“顿巴斯一型”联合采煤机时，由于在大连钢厂订的镍铬钢不到，某些部件不得不用粗料代替，影响了机器的质量。另一个工厂在抗议信中写道：“由于你厂不按期交货……致使我厂生产停工……已成为我厂能否完成今年生产任务的关键。”由于大连钢厂不按期交货，已破坏了许多厂矿的生产计划。
    是不是有些技术问题不能解决，使他们不能按期交货呢？不是的。该厂接受的订货，也编到作业计划里去，但从来没有一个月认真按作业计划进行生产，甚至有意不完成订货计划。炼钢车间在炼钢时，发现炭高了也不脱炭，就改为“高炭钢”，发现炭低了就改为“低炭钢”。这个车间在去年十一月，任意改了二十二次钢种。厂内的生产竟混乱到这种程度，车间也可以随便拒绝生产计划。去年十月，有一批弹簧钢的订货，技术条件要求较高，轧钢车间主任马成功就命令工人停止生产，并对生产科说：“以后不要接受这样难干的活！”类似这样“自由”生产的情形，在该厂已经习以为常。特别一到月末，一看距离完成计划尚远，车间就随意乱干，什么好干干什么，只要吨数超过就行。去年七月，应当生产的某种钢材缺了五千公斤，而不需要生产的却超额生产了十一万一千六百公斤。于是一方面大量欠交，一方面又大量地积压。该厂从去年一月到现在，已经接到两千多份抗议信，抗议他们不按期交货。但是大连钢厂的领导工作人员对待这些抗议，避不做正面答复，总是文不对题地说些什么“人力不可抗拒”“技术条件所限”等千篇一律的理由，甚至事先印刷了大批延期交货理由的公函，企图逃避对方罚款。
    大连钢厂的资本主义经营思想的另一种表现，就是只顾完成产量任务，不惜大量浪费国家资金。
    该厂去年成本超支达一百六十多万元，今年第一季又超过计划八十八万元。由于浪费资金现象严重，去年一年由银行贷款六百四十万元，仅利息就付了四十三万元。
    去年，厂长袁执中提出“大力支援炼钢”的口号，要其他部门无条件地、不惜血本地为炼钢部门服务，谁若是服务不力，谁就要受到厂长的批评。于是本来就很混乱的供应部门更加混乱，大量购入和大量积压材料。钢丝车间要用重柴油，车间请领三十吨，供应科一下子就订购了一百五十吨，实际只用了七吨。炼钢车间在炼钢时，发现炭低了，就随便到供应科的铸铁堆里拿来一些投入炉里。供应科看见不仅不制止，反而将铸铁运到车间门口，请他们随便拿用。结果炼钢车间每一炉钢都比定额多放一百公斤甚至一吨的钢料，仅今年第一季度就多用了一千吨左右的废钢。全厂的用具钢一年约需二百五十吨，本来应该用一般炭钢，但他们也用优质钢来代替，这一项就浪费了九万元。
    大连钢厂追求产量，似乎只是为了有个数字上报，对生产出来的成品，就没有人注意了。一次，生产了九百六十公斤钢材，用户前来提货，竟不知下落，只好承担罚款；后来找到这批钢材时，已全部生锈，变成了废品。许多不同规格、种类的钢材混放在一起，底下垫得不平，上边盖得不严，大部生锈变质。去年一次盘库时，光是成品就盘亏四十九万元。
    追求产量，也就不顾质量。去年一年，该厂的废品、次品多达三千五百五十八吨。生产次品、废品，在这个工厂似乎已成为“合法”的行为。去年，炼钢车间共发生了一百三十九次质量事故，违反操作规程两千多次，工厂领导工作人员从不注意追究事故责任，改进产品质量。轧钢车间生产的盘条因不合需要，大量积压，决定改变规格。为此，需要改变轧钢机的孔型。在设计孔型时，有一个方案可以保证质量，但效率低些，另一个方案生产效率高，但不能保证质量，他们竟采用了效率高的那一方案，结果生产出来的盘条质量低劣，又造成大量积压。钢丝车间生产了一千多吨铁丝原料，其中有三百多吨不合格，不得不重新加工，但车间工人却得到了“超额奖励”。由于产品低劣，厂里常收到使用单位的抗议信，去年达三百六十七件，今年一至四月即达二百零一件。
    大连钢厂所以有这些问题，厂长袁执中应负主要责任。袁执中有严重的资产阶级个人主义。他一九五二年来到大连钢厂，本来对大连钢厂的具体情况和业务都不十分了解，但他自恃当过纺织厂长和原东北工业部办公室副主任，即主观主义地对钢厂进行一系列的“改革”，结果按照他的意图“改革”后的工厂，反而更加混乱。该厂质量低劣，是尽人皆知的，但别人一提出时，他即纠正说：“不是质量低劣，而是质量波动。”一次，中共旅大市委工业部一位负责同志和他谈话，指出“大连钢厂几年来没有多大进步”，他立即辩解说：“不是没有多大进步，而是进步较慢。”
    但不管袁执中的看法如何，工厂完不成国家计划是铁的事实，于是袁执中便想走捷径，弄虚做假。在国家迫切需要钢材的时候，他有意编制保守计划，对工作人员说：“不要把计划编高了，我们完不成，上级要打‘屁股’！”一九五四年的计划就是根据一九五三年一至八月的落后定额编的。但这样计划也难于完成，于是就走上了片面追逐产量的“捷径”。前述那些错误的做法，都是在袁执中许可甚至鼓励下发生的，有的甚至在袁执中亲自参与下进行。以前，大连机车车辆厂在该厂订购过弹簧钢，合同规定都是“较高精确度”，有一次合同上漏掉了这个规定，于是车间就趁机按“普通精确度”生产，生产到十四吨时，被技术监督科发现，提议用电话同货主联系一下，袁执中说：“不用联系，一联系什么麻烦事都来了！”技术监督科说：“人家不要怎办？”袁执中说：“有合同替咱们说话！”结果生产了四百吨，给对方造成很大麻烦。去年十一月，大连钢厂屡经上级机关批评，曾不得不控制一下“自由生产”，袁执中亲手批下命令：“不符合当月作业计划者，一律不得入库。”但到今年三月，他又下令：“车间生产的东西，一律入库。”结果，四月份推销科推销了四十吨积压钢材，当月却入库了七十吨计划外的产品，这自然无法彻底处理积压。
    袁执中在工作中缺乏依靠党、依靠群众的观念，片面地强调一长制，忽视党的监督和民主管理。决定工厂的重大问题时，他总是独断专行，不在党委会上讨论。去年编制计划时，未提交党委会讨论就上报，有人提出意见，他还说：“你们不懂，讨论也提不出什么意见。”由于袁执中轻视党在企业中的作用，在工作人员中曾有过这样的错误论调：“支部关一天门不要紧，行政关一天门就完不成计划。”这就是说，已有不少人认为企业中党的组织是可有可无的了！
    自然，大连钢厂有许多工作人员不同意袁执中的做法，曾提议要扭转错误的经营方法，但袁执中拒绝了同志们的批评和意见。今年二月，在袁执中去北京的时候，工厂里开过一次会，研究为什么不能按品种完成计划。当时，有关人员都根据四中全会的精神，做了检讨，大家都准备改进工作，并且信心很大。但是袁执中回厂听过汇报后，大为恼怒，认为太“左”了，还说：“过去检查、批判过多少次了，问题、毛病还不是照旧存在吗！”于是大家的满腔热情，又被袁执中给压下去了。
    大连钢厂已被错误的领导思想拖住无法前进了！最近，袁执中在中国共产党旅大市代表会议上作了检讨，尽管检讨得还不深刻，但总算初步表现出了改进错误的意愿。希望袁执中切实地在实际行动来表现出自己的决心；同时，也希望重工业部加强对大连钢厂的具体领导和帮助。
