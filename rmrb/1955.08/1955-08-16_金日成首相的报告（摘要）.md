Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 15th. Premier Kim Il-sung of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea delivered an important report on the evening of the 14th at a Pyongyang rally celebrating the 10th anniversary of the liberation of Korea.

In his report, Kim Il-sung first, in the name of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and the Republic's government, expressed the greatest gratitude and honor, on behalf of all the Korean people, to the great Soviet people, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the Soviet army—the liberators, helpers, and sincere friends of the Korean people. He expressed the greatest gratitude and honor to the great Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, the government of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who have continuously given tremendous assistance to the Korean people in the anti-Japanese armed struggle, the struggle against American aggression, and post-war reconstruction, and extended warm congratulations to all the Korean people who have waged a protracted struggle to shake off Japanese imperialist rule and restore their homeland, and who have selflessly struggled for the construction of a democratic and independent country, the resistance to American aggression, the defense of the freedom and independence of the fatherland, post-war reconstruction, and the peaceful reunification of the fatherland in the ten years since liberation.

Next, in his report, Kim Il-sung summarized the great achievements made by the people of northern Korea in various aspects of democratic construction under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea and the Republic's government in the ten years since liberation. He spoke about the victorious significance of the Korean people's three-year anti-aggression war. He explained the flourishing scene of peaceful construction in northern Korea after the armistice and the dark situation in South Korea under the rule of the U.S. and Syngman Rhee. Kim Il-sung also analyzed the current domestic and international situation, put forward positive proposals on the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea, and pointed out the direction of future efforts for all the Korean people.

In summarizing the construction achievements of northern Korea over the past ten years, Kim Il-sung said: "The great Soviet army not only liberated the Korean people from the colonial rule of Japanese imperialism but also created conditions for North Korea's prosperity and development." Kim Il-sung emphatically pointed out: "The establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 1948 was an epoch-making event in Korean history. Because of the establishment of the People's Republic, the Soviet army withdrew from the northern part of the Republic, and our Republic established diplomatic relations with various democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union, becoming a member of the peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp." Kim Il-sung said: "After implementing a series of democratic reforms, by the end of 1949, the production volume of the main sectors of the national economy had significantly exceeded the level of 1944 before liberation."

Kim Il-sung then spoke about the armed aggression against northern Korea launched by the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique in June 1950, which had been prepared for a long time. He said, "The three-year Fatherland Liberation War against the American armed aggressors and their lackeys was the most severe test for our people." Kim Il-sung pointed out: "In this arduous struggle, our people and their brave armed forces, under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea and the Republic's government, displayed unprecedented heroism and patriotic selflessness on the front lines and in the rear, and gloriously withstood this severe test. As everyone knows, the international imperialist coalition headed by U.S. imperialism suffered a shameful defeat on the Korean battlefield and had to sign the armistice agreement."

Kim Il-sung said: This is a great historical victory for the Korean people and a victory for the entire peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp. He pointed out: "The fact that the great Chinese people launched the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement and sent their heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army to aid us with their blood, guaranteeing our common victory, is a new example of proletarian internationalist assistance." Kim Il-sung emphasized: "The outcome of the Korean War shows that the era in which imperialists arbitrarily conquered and plundered weak nations is gone forever; it also shows that as long as the people take up arms to resist the aggressors and fight bravely to the end, they can defend their national independence and freedom."

Kim Il-sung then spoke about the peaceful construction in northern Korea after the armistice. He cited figures to illustrate the brilliant achievements made by the people of northern Korea in industry, agriculture, transportation, cultural education, and urban transportation construction in the two years after the armistice, and the continuous improvement of the material and cultural life of the working people. He pointed out: "The tasks of the first year of the three-year plan for the restoration and development of the national economy have been successfully completed, and the plan for 1955, a year of decisive significance in the three-year plan, is now being implemented fruitfully." Kim Il-sung said: "In order to complete and overfulfill the three-year plan for restoring and building the people's economy, we must persist in a tense struggle. After the completion of the three-year plan, we must continue to work hard to develop our people's economy to a higher level. Our Party Central Committee estimates that the three-year plan, which will end next year, will be successfully completed, and it is now discussing the basic guidelines for the five-year plan for the people's economy, which will begin in 1957. The realization of the five-year plan for the people's economy will lay the foundation for the future socialist industrialization of our country."

Kim Il-sung called on all the people to practice strict economy, cherish state property, raise revolutionary vigilance, and strive to build their country stronger and better, and to make people's lives more prosperous.

Then, Kim Il-sung talked about the situation in South Korea. He said: "In order to permanently occupy South Korea, the U.S. imperialists have supported a puppet regime and have been implementing a cruel policy of plunder, deepening the division between North and South Korea, and hindering Korea from becoming a democratically unified country."

Kim Il-sung pointed out: "The war launched by the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique has left South Korea's economy in an even more pitiful state, and the lives of the working people are even more miserable. In the two years after the armistice, no major factory reconstruction projects have been carried out in South Korea, and industrial production in 1954 has decreased even more than it did at the time of the armistice. The United States is dumping surplus consumer goods in South Korea in the name of 'aid'. The so-called 'revival plan' used by Syngman Rhee to deceive the people is, as the South Korean newspapers say, like 'drawing a cake to satisfy hunger'. In South Korea, industry and agriculture are constantly being damaged, small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators and handicraftsmen are going bankrupt one after another, and the number of unemployed has reached two million. In the past year, there has been a shortage of more than 4.3 million *seok* of grain, 460,000 households have been cut off from grain, and farmers owe an average of about 9,000 *hwan* per household. Prices continue to rise, and the commodity retail price index at the end of 1954 has increased to more than 2.1 times that of July 1953 (when the Korean armistice was signed)."

Kim Il-sung said: "The fundamental reason for South Korea's situation is the U.S. imperialists' cruel colonial plunder policy and the Syngman Rhee clique's anti-people policy of expanding the army and preparing for war."

Kim Il-sung analyzed the current domestic and international situation, and generally described the consistent efforts made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve the peaceful reunification of North and South Korea, and the consistent obstruction and sabotage by the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique. He also sternly denounced the provocative statements made recently by the Syngman Rhee clique, with the sympathy and support of the United States, openly clamoring to invade areas such as Kaesong and Ongjin, and the series of atrocities committed against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

Next, Kim Il-sung focused on the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea and put forward positive proposals. Kim Il-sung said: "Our principles and position on the peaceful reunification of Korea are very clear. The issue of Korean reunification must be resolved in accordance with the will of the Korean people themselves. To this end, foreign troops must be withdrawn, and the people of North and South Korea must sit down together to discuss the Korean issue without foreign interference, establish a unified and democratic central government based on the free will of the people of North and South Korea, and the nature of the government will be determined by the representatives elected by the people. This is the unanimous desire of all the Korean people and the most correct way to peacefully resolve the Korean issue."

Kim Il-sung emphasized: "To achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea, we must first consolidate the armistice and create conditions for mutual contact between North and South Korea." He said: "The countries concerned about the Korean issue should make efforts and must assume the obligation to guarantee that there will be no more war in Korea, and to guarantee that no actions will occur that threaten peace in Korea. It is hoped that a Far East conference with the broad participation of Asian countries will be convened by the countries concerned to seek a plan for the peaceful reunification of Korea."

Kim Il-sung continued: "We propose that the authorities of North and South Korea announce to the people of North and South Korea and to the people of the world: In order to eliminate the existing distrust and tension between the North and the South, they undertake the obligation not to exercise any force against each other, but only to resolve all issues related to the unification of Korea by peaceful means, and in order to reduce the military burden on the people of North and South Korea and to transfer non-productive manpower to peaceful construction, the armies of North and South Korea will be reduced to the minimum."

Kim Il-sung also said: "Taking into account the desire of all the Korean people for mutual rapprochement and consultation between North and South Korea, we advocate striving to convene a conference of government representatives of North and South Korea as soon as possible to discuss the issue of unifying Korea."

Kim Il-sung pointed out: "All of our people must further expand and strengthen the united democratic front for the reunification of the fatherland, uniting all classes. We will welcome anyone who sincerely desires national unity and the reunification of the fatherland, regardless of their political views and beliefs, and we will consult with them." Kim Il-sung said: "This is because today all our undertakings and actions must completely subordinate to the most important task of our people at present - to complete the unification and independence of Korea by peaceful means."

Kim Il-sung pointed out: "Today's international situation is changing in a direction that is favorable to our people's completion of this most important task."

In conclusion, Kim Il-sung called on all the Korean people to unite more firmly around the Workers' Party of Korea and the Republic's government, advance toward new victories in socialist construction, and continue to wage a resolute struggle for the peaceful reunification and independence of the fatherland.

    金日成首相的报告（摘要）
    新华社平壤十五日电朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成十四日晚在平壤各界庆祝朝鲜解放十周年大会上作了重要报告。
    金日成在报告中首先以朝鲜劳动党中央委员会和共和国政府的名义，代表全体朝鲜人民向朝鲜人民的解放者、援助者和真诚的朋友——伟大的苏联人民、苏联共产党、苏联政府和苏联军队致最大的感谢和荣誉；向在抗日武装斗争中、反抗美国侵略的斗争中和战后恢复建设中不断给朝鲜人民莫大援助的伟大的中国人民、中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和中国人民志愿军致最大的感谢和荣誉；向曾为摆脱日本帝国主义统治、光复自己祖国进行过长期斗争，解放后十年来为建设民主独立国家、反抗美国侵略、捍卫祖国自由独立、战后恢复建设和祖国和平统一而忘我斗争的全体朝鲜人民致热烈的祝贺。
    接着，金日成在报告中总结了解放后十年来朝鲜北部人民在朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府领导下在政治、经济、文化等各方面进行民主建设所取得的巨大成就；谈到了朝鲜人民进行三年反侵略战争的胜利意义；说明了停战后朝鲜北部从事和平建设的蓬勃景象和南朝鲜在美李统治下的黑暗状况。金日成并且分析了当前的国内外形势；对朝鲜和平统一问题提出了积极的主张；并且为全体朝鲜人民指出了今后的努力方向。
    在总结朝鲜北部十年来的建设成就时，金日成说：伟大的苏军不仅从日本帝国主义的殖民地统治下解放了朝鲜人民，而且为北朝鲜的繁荣发展创造了条件。金日成着重指出：“一九四八年，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的创建，是朝鲜历史上划时代的事件。由于人民共和国的创建，苏联军队撤离了共和国北部，我们共和国同以苏联为首的各民主国家建立了外交关系，成为和平民主社会主义阵营的一员。”金日成说：人民政权在实施了一系列民主改革之后，到一九四九年底，国民经济各主要部门的生产量已经显著超过了解放前一九四四年的水平。
　　金日成然后谈到，美国和李承晚集团在一九五零年六月发动了准备已久的对朝鲜北部的武装侵略。他说：“反抗美国武装侵略者及其走狗的三年祖国解放战争，对我们人民来说是一次最严重的考验。”金日成指出：“在这一艰苦的斗争中，我们人民及其勇敢的武装力量在朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府领导下，在前线和后方发挥了史无前例的英雄主义和爱国主义的忘我精神，光荣地经受了这种严重的考验。大家知道，以美帝国主义为首的十六个国家的国际帝国主义联合势力在朝鲜战场上遭到了可耻的失败，不得不签订停战协定。”
    金日成说：这是朝鲜人民巨大的历史性胜利，也是整个和平民主社会主义阵营的胜利。他指出：“伟大的中国人民展开抗美援朝运动，并派遣自己英勇的中国人民志愿军以鲜血援助我们，保障了我们的共同胜利这一事实，是无产阶级国际主义援助的新榜样。”金日成强调说：“朝鲜战争的结果表明，帝国主义者任意征服和掠夺弱小民族的那种时代已经一去不复返了；它又表明，只要人民拿起武器奋起反抗侵略者，并且勇敢地斗争到底，就能够保卫自己的民族独立和自由。”　　金日成接着谈到停战后朝鲜北部的和平建设。他列举数字，说明朝鲜北部人民在停战后的两年中，在工业、农业、交通运输、文化教育和城市交通建设方面所取得的光辉成就和劳动人民物质文化生活的不断改善。他指出：人民经济恢复发展三年计划的第一年的任务已经胜利完成，现在正有成果地实行着三年计划中有决定意义的一年——一九五五年的计划。金日成说：“为了完成和超额完成恢复建设人民经济的三年计划，我们必须坚持紧张的斗争。在三年计划完成以后，为了把我国人民经济发展到更高的水平，还必须继续努力。我们党中央委员会估计规定在明年结束的三年计划将会胜利完成，现在正讨论将在一九五七年开始实施的人民经济五年计划的基本方针问题。实现五年人民经济计划，将会奠定我国将来实现社会主义工业化的基础。”
    金日成号召全体人民厉行节约，爱护国家财产，提高革命警惕性，为把自己的国家建设得更富强、更美好，为使人民生活更加富裕而努力。
    然后，金日成谈到南朝鲜的情况。他说：美帝国主义者为了永久侵占南朝鲜，扶植了傀儡政权，一直实施着残酷的掠夺政策，加深南北朝鲜的分裂，阻挠朝鲜成为民主统一的国家。
    金日成指出：美国和李承晚集团发动的战争已使南朝鲜的经济处于更加可怜的状态，劳动人民的生活更加悲惨。在停战后的两年中，南朝鲜没有进行任何重要工厂的重建工程，一九五四年的工业生产反而比停战当时更加减少。美国以“援助”为名，在南朝鲜倾销剩余消费品。李承晚用以欺骗人民的所谓“复兴计划”，正像南朝鲜报刊所说的一样，有如“画饼充饥”。在南朝鲜，工业、农业不断遭到破坏，中小工商业家和手工业者陆续破产，失业人数已达二百万。在过去一年中缺粮四百三十万石以上，断粮农户达四十六万户，农民欠债平均每户约九千圜。物价不断上涨，一九五四年末的商品零售价格指数已增加到一九五三年七月（朝鲜停战时）的二点一倍以上。
    金日成说：南朝鲜处于这种状况的根本原因在于美帝国主义残酷的殖民掠夺政策和李承晚集团反人民的扩军备战政策。
    金日成分析了当前的国内外形势，概括地叙述了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国为实现南北朝鲜的和平统一而作的一贯努力和美国及李承晚集团的一贯阻挠和破坏。他并且严正斥责了李承晚集团在美国的同情支持下最近公开叫嚣要侵占开城、瓮津等地区的挑衅性声明和对中立国监察委员会施加的一连串暴行。
    接着，金日成着重谈到朝鲜和平统一问题，并提出了积极的主张。金日成说：“我们为朝鲜的和平统一的原则和立场是很明白的。朝鲜的统一问题必须按照朝鲜人自己的意志加以解决。为此，必须撤走外国军队，在没有外国干涉的情况下，南北朝鲜人民坐在一起讨论朝鲜问题，以南北朝鲜人民的自由意志为基础，建立统一的民主的中央政府，由人民选举的代表规定政府的性质。这是全体朝鲜人民的一致愿望，是和平解决朝鲜问题的最正确的道路。”
    金日成强调指出：要实现朝鲜的和平统一，首先必须巩固停战和创造南北朝鲜相互接触的条件。他说：“关心朝鲜问题的有关国家应当进行努力，必须承担义务保证在朝鲜不再发生战争，保证不发生威胁朝鲜和平的任何行动。希望由各有关国家召开有亚洲国家广泛参加的远东会议，来谋求和平统一朝鲜的方案。”
    金日成接着说：“我们建议由南北朝鲜政权当局向南北朝鲜人民和全世界人民宣布：为了消除南北之间现存的不信任和紧张局势而承担义务，不行使任何反对对方的武力，而只以和平方法来解决一切有关统一朝鲜的问题，并且为了减轻南北朝鲜人民的军费负担和将非生产的人力转用于和平建设，把南北朝鲜军队缩减到最低限度。”
    金日成又说：“我们考虑到全体朝鲜人民要求南北朝鲜相互接近和协商的愿望，主张努力争取尽速召开南北朝鲜政府代表会议，以便讨论统一朝鲜的问题。”
    金日成指出：我们全体人民要进一步扩大和加强联合各阶层的祖国统一民主主义战线。任何真诚愿望民族团结和祖国统一的人，不管他们的政治见解和信仰如何，我们都将欢迎他们，并同他们协商。金日成说：这是因为，今天我们的一切事业和行动都必须完全服从我国人民当前的最重大任务——以和平方法来完成朝鲜的统一和独立的目的。
    金日成指出：今天的国际形势正朝着有利于我国人民完成这个最重大任务的方向转变着。
    金日成最后号召全朝鲜人民更加坚强地团结在朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府周围，向着社会主义建设的新胜利前进，并为实现祖国的和平统一和独立而继续进行坚决的斗争。
