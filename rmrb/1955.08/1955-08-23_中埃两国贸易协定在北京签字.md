After ten days of negotiations, the representatives of the two countries reached a complete agreement on the trade Agreement between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Egyptian Republic and the Protocol on the first agreement year of the Sino-Egyptian Trade Agreement, and held a signing ceremony in Beijing at 6:30 pm on the 22nd.

Signing on behalf of the Egyptian Republic was Mohamed Abdu Naser, head of the trade delegation of the Egyptian Republic and Minister of Commerce and Industry of Egypt. Signing on behalf of the People's Republic of China was Ye JiZhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade of the People's Republic of China.

At the signing ceremony, Ye JiZhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade, spoke first. He said: The signing of the Sino-Egyptian Trade Agreement and the protocol for the first agreement year demonstrates the sincere desire of the two governments to develop economic and trade relations between the two countries, and marks a new page in the history of economic and trade relations between two ancient civilizations. It is not only of great significance for the development of the economies of China and Egypt and fully conforms to the common interests and aspirations of the people of China and Egypt, but also helps to enhance the friendship between the people of China and Egypt and is beneficial to the cause of peace in Asia, Africa, and the world. I believe that our two governments will, in the same spirit, actively exert their utmost efforts to implement this agreement and protocol, so that this agreement and protocol can be fully realized.

Ye JiZhuang said: This time, both sides of our negotiations proceeded in an extremely friendly atmosphere, in the spirit of "economic cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit and mutual respect for national sovereignty" as pointed out in the final communiqué of the Asian-African Conference. This is a concrete manifestation of the growing mutual understanding and friendly relations between the governments and peoples of China and Egypt.

Mohamed Abdu Naser, head of the trade delegation of the Egyptian Republic, also spoke. He said: At this memorable moment, at this moment when the Egyptian-Chinese trade agreement, which serves as a practical step to strengthen relations between Egypt and China, is being signed, I am pleased to express my gratitude for the warm reception and the concern of the Government of the People's Republic of China for the delegation since the arrival of the trade delegation of the Government of the Egyptian Republic in China.

He said: Our negotiations were conducted in an extremely friendly atmosphere. Both sides have cooperated closely in achieving the common goal of mutual benefit.

He said: Although the days of staying in China are very short, we have seen the great efforts made by the great Chinese people in developing the national economy. We are very impressed by China's many new and exquisite products. I hope these products will gain sales in the vast market of Egypt.

He finally pointed out: In strengthening trade relations, the problem does not lie in the provisions of a trade agreement, but in the sincerity of implementing these provisions. I would like to affirm that the Egyptian government will make its best efforts for this purpose.

Finally, the representatives of China and Egypt raised their glasses to warmly congratulate each other. (Attached picture)
