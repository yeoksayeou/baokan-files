Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th - TASS reported from Moscow on the 12th: "Izvestia" published an article by Mikhailov entitled "Syngman Rhee's Despicable Work."

The article states that the enemies of peace in Asia have now entrusted Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan, Ngo Dinh Diem in South Vietnam, and Syngman Rhee in South Korea with carrying out "despicable work" to artificially exacerbate the situation in the region.

The author detailed the essence of the provocative actions recently carried out by the Syngman Rhee government. He wrote: Syngman Rhee's conspiracy is as obvious as his "despicable work." Foreign newspapers unanimously believe that this conspiracy is an attempt to exacerbate tensions in Korea, pave the way for military adventures, and undermine the opportunity for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Neither the territorial claims of the South Korean authorities nor their demand to stop the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission are justified. The author continued: This commission has done much to maintain the armistice since its establishment. It is clear that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is seen as a thorn in the side by the South Korean authorities precisely because they want to undermine the armistice agreement and tear it up.

The article states that it cannot be ignored that, in the context of the universal demand for easing international tensions prevalent after the Geneva Conference, Syngman Rhee's provocative behavior is not only met with more resolute condemnation from world public opinion than ever before, but also with criticism from officials in some countries. The statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China on the 11th correctly assessed the provocative behavior of the Seoul government. This statement put forward important proposals for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

The article concludes that the broad public of all countries demands: the cessation of the provocative behavior of those who oppose easing international tensions in Asia; and the removal of all obstacles on the road to a peaceful resolution of all Far Eastern issues for the benefit of the people of Asian countries and the interests of world peace.

Xinhua News Agency reported: The Czechoslovakian newspaper "Red Right" commented on the provocative actions of the Syngman Rhee clique in Korea against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on the 12th, stating that the United States should also bear considerable responsibility for the provocations of the Syngman Rhee clique. The commentary pointed out that Dulles's statement on the 10th supported the shameless actions of the Syngman Rhee clique.

The commentary said that the provocative actions of the enemies of peace against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission are currently threatening peace in Korea.

The commentary emphasized that, in view of the important responsibilities borne by the members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and for the sake of strengthening peace, the current developments in South Korea require a high degree of solidarity among all the members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

The commentary pointed out that, for the sake of peace and security in the Far East, it is now particularly necessary for all relevant countries to fulfill the Korean Armistice Agreement.

### 苏联和捷克斯洛伐克报纸  要求制止李承晚破坏和平的龌龊工作

    苏联和捷克斯洛伐克报纸
    要求制止李承晚破坏和平的龌龊工作
    新华社十二日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：“消息报”发表了米哈伊洛夫的一篇文章，题目是“李承晚的龌龊工作”。
    这篇文章说，亚洲和平的敌人现在已经委托台湾的蒋介石、南越的吴庭艳和南朝鲜的李承晚进行“龌龊的工作”来人为地使这个地区的局势尖锐化。
    作者详细地说明了李承晚政府最近进行的挑衅行动的实质。他写道：李承晚的阴谋是同他的“龌龊工作”一样明显的。外国报纸一致认为，这种阴谋是企图使朝鲜紧张局势尖锐化，为军事冒险铺平道路，以及破坏和平解决朝鲜问题的机会。无论是南朝鲜当局的领土要求或是他们提出的关于停止中立国监察委员会的工作的要求都是毫无根据的。作者接着说：这一委员会自从它成立以来，做了许多有助于维持停战的工作。由此看来很明显，中立国监察委员会之所以被南朝鲜当局视为眼中钉，正是因为南朝鲜当局要破坏停战协定，并且要撕毁停战协定。
    文章说，不能不注意到，在日内瓦会议之后流行的普遍要求缓和国际紧张局势的情况下，李承晚的挑衅行为不仅受到全世界舆论比任何时候都更为坚决的指责，而且也受到一些国家官方人士的指责。中华人民共和国外交部十一日发表的声明对汉城政府的挑衅行为作了正确的估价。这一声明中提出了和平解决朝鲜问题的重要建议。
    文章最后说，各国广大的公众要求：制止反对缓和亚洲国际紧张局势的人的挑衅行为；为了亚洲各国人民的利益和世界和平的利益，消除和平解决一切远东问题的道路上的一切障碍。
    据新华社讯　捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”十二日评论李承晚集团在朝鲜反对中立国监察委员会的挑衅行动说，美国对李承晚集团的挑衅也应负不小的责任。评论指出，杜勒斯十日发表的谈话支持李承晚集团的无耻行动。
    评论说，和平的敌人目前反对中立国监察委员会的挑衅行动威胁着朝鲜的和平。
    评论强调说，鉴于中立国监察委员会的委员们所负的重大责任，以及为了加强和平起见，南朝鲜目前的事态发展要求中立国监察委员会所有的委员们高度团结。
    评论指出，为了远东和平和安全，现在特别需要一切有关国家履行朝鲜停战协定。
