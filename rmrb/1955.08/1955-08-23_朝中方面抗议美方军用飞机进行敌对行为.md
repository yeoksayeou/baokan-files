　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 22nd: The Korean Central News Agency in Kaesong reports: The Military Armistice Commission held a meeting on the 21st. Major General Zheng Guolu, the chief member of the Korean and Chinese side, lodged a strong protest with the U.S. side regarding the provocative act of the U.S. side dispatching military aircraft on August 17th to intrude into the airspace of the Korean and Chinese side's military control area to scout the defensive facilities of the Korean and Chinese side. He also demanded that the U.S. side take effective measures to severely punish those involved in this incident and ensure that such incidents do not occur again.
    At the meeting, the U.S. side, disregarding the living evidence that the U.S. military aircraft was hit by the defensive forces of the Korean and Chinese side, which took self-defense measures when the aircraft intruded into the Korean and Chinese side's military control area to carry out hostile acts, and crashed in the Korean and Chinese side's military control area, and that the pilot on the plane was captured by the Korean and Chinese side, shamelessly used contradictory arguments and sophistry to slander the Korean and Chinese side, and attempted to cover up the truth of the incident and shirk its serious responsibility for violently violating the Armistice Agreement.
    In response, Major General Zheng Guolu once again demanded that the U.S. side, in the face of irrefutable evidence, acknowledge the facts and assume the responsibility for this incident. Major General Zheng Guolu emphasized: "This hostile act you have carried out against our side is directly related to the provocative acts of the Li Seung-man bandit gang, which are openly clamoring to undermine the Armistice Agreement and forcibly occupy our side's areas south of the 38th parallel. Our side cannot tolerate anyone undermining the Armistice Agreement, nor can we tolerate anyone infringing upon our rights."
    At the meeting, Major General Zheng Guolu informed the U.S. side that, based on humanitarian principles and the consistent policy of the Korean and Chinese side, and in accordance with the U.S. side's request, the body of Captain Brown, who was on board the U.S. military aircraft currently within the Korean and Chinese side's military control area, as well as Second Lieutenant Benpahs, the pilot of the aircraft captured by the Korean and Chinese side, and the body of the aircraft, can be handed over to the U.S. side. At the meeting, both sides agreed that the secretaries of both sides would discuss the location and time of the handover.
    In his speech at the meeting, Major General Zheng Guolu described in detail the course of the provocative act by the U.S. military aircraft. He said: At 2:05 p.m. on August 17th, the weather was clear. A U.S. military aircraft flew from the south and intruded into the airspace above Mount Wusheng within the Korean and Chinese side's military control area. After circling three times over Gaotuxian and Zaigongdong, northeast of Mount Wusheng, the aircraft turned northeast, passed over Mount Jiufeng, and penetrated about 20 kilometers north of the military demarcation line north of Jincheng to the airspace above Sugu. At this time, the aircraft was shot at by the defensive forces of the Korean and Chinese side and suddenly turned south before crashing near Jindong in the Korean and Chinese side's military control area, 230 meters north of the northern edge of the demilitarized zone. Major General Zheng Guolu said: When this U.S. military aircraft intruded into the airspace of the Korean and Chinese side's military control area, the observers of the Korean and Chinese side closely monitored it. The aircraft was conducting low-altitude reconnaissance at a speed of about 250 kilometers per hour at an altitude of 400 to 500 meters, and gradually penetrated into the airspace of the Korean and Chinese side's military control area.
    At the meeting, Major General Zheng Guolu refuted the sophistry of the U.S. side to evade responsibility based on the facts. He said: Second Lieutenant Benpahs, the pilot of the U.S. military aircraft captured by the Korean and Chinese side, claimed: "The distance from the location where I was first shot at in the north to the location where I landed in the south is about ten miles." The situation described by Benpahs is consistent with what the observers of the Korean and Chinese side witnessed, which completely exposes the lie fabricated by the U.S. side that the aircraft only entered the demilitarized zone and did not infringe upon the military control area of the Korean and Chinese side.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 22nd: The Korean Central News Agency in Kaesong reports: The meeting of the secretaries of both sides of the Military Armistice Commission was held at 1:00 p.m. on August 21st. At the meeting, specific arrangements were discussed for the handover of the body of U.S. Army Captain Brown, who was on board the U.S. military aircraft that intruded into the Korean and Chinese side's military control area on August 17th and was shot down by the defensive forces of the Korean and Chinese side, and U.S. Army Second Lieutenant Benpahs, the captured pilot of the aircraft.
    Both sides reached an agreement at the meeting that the bodies of the aforementioned U.S. personnel Brown and Benpahs would be handed over by both sides at 3:00 p.m. on August 23rd at the location where the Fourth Joint Observer Group regularly meets.

### 朝中方面抗议美方军用飞机进行敌对行为

　　朝中方面抗议美方军用飞机进行敌对行为
    新华社平壤二十二日电　朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：军事停战委员会在二十一日举行会议。朝中方面首席委员郑国禄少将就美方在八月十七日派遣军用飞机侵入朝中方面军事控制地区上空侦察朝中方面防御设施的挑衅性行为，向美方提出强硬抗议，并且要求美方采取有效措施，严惩与这一事件有关的人员，保证这一类事件不再发生。
    美方在会上不顾美方军用飞机在侵入朝中方面军事控制地区进行敌对行为时被采取自卫措施的朝中方面防御部队所击中落于朝中方面军事控制地区、飞机上的驾驶员被朝中方面捕获的活生生的证据，竟无耻地以自相矛盾的论调和诡辩来诽谤朝中方面，并且企图掩盖事件的真相，推卸它横暴地违反停战协定的严重责任。
    对此，郑国禄少将再一次要求美方在无可辩驳的证据面前承认事实，负起对这一事件应负的责任。郑国禄少将着重指出：“你方向我方进行的这一次敌对行为，是和李承晚匪帮公然叫嚣破坏停战协定，强占三八线以南的我方地区的挑衅行为直接有关的。我方不能容许任何人破坏停战协定，同时，不能容许任何人侵害我方的权利。”
    郑国禄少将在会上通知美方，朝中方面根据人道原则和朝中方面一贯的方针，并且按照美方的要求，可以把现在朝中方面军事控制地区内的乘坐美方军用飞机的布朗上尉的尸体、被朝中方面捕获的这架飞机的驾驶员本帕斯少尉和飞机的机体交给美方。在会上双方同意由双方秘书长讨论交接的地点和时间。
    郑国禄少将在这次会议上的发言中详细地叙述了美方军用飞机进行挑衅行为的经过，他说：八月十七日下午二时零五分，天气晴朗，美方军用飞机一架由南方飞来侵入朝中方面军事控制地区内的五圣山上空。这架飞机在五圣山东北的高突岘和斋宫洞上空盘旋三次后转向东北，经过鹫峰上空深入到金城以北军事分界线以北约二十公里的苏谷上空。这时，这架飞机遭到朝中方面防御部队的射击而急转向南不久即坠落于非军事区北缘以北二百三十公尺的朝中方面军事控制地区内的斤洞附近。郑国禄少将说：当这架美方军用飞机侵入朝中方面的军事控制地区上空时，朝中方面的观测员就密切地监视着它，这架飞机以每小时约二百五十公里的速度在四百到五百公尺的高度作低飞侦察，并且逐渐深入朝中方面军事控制地区上空。
    郑国禄少将在会上根据事实驳斥了美方为企图逃避责任而进行的诡辩。他说：被朝中方面捕获的美方军用飞机驾驶员本帕斯少尉自称：“我在北方最初遭到射击的地点到我在南方着陆的地点约有十英里”。本帕斯所说的情况和朝中方面观测员所目睹的情况是相符合的，这就完全揭穿了美方所捏造的这架飞机只是进入非军事区而并未侵犯朝中方面军事控制地区的谎言。
    新华社平壤二十二日电　朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：军事停战委员会双方秘书长会议在八月二十一日下午一时举行。在会上讨论了交接八月十七日侵入朝中方面军事控制地区、遭到朝中方面防御部队的射击而被击落的美方军用飞机搭乘人员美军上尉布朗的尸体和被捕获的飞机驾驶员美军少尉本帕斯的具体安排。
    双方在会上达成协议，双方在八月二十三日下午三时，在第四联合观察小组经常会晤的地点，交接上述美方人员布朗的尸体和美方人员本帕斯。
