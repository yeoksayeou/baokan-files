Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 6th: The Guangzhou press interviewed Mr. Anil Kumar Chanda, head of the Indian Cultural Delegation, on the 6th.

Mr. Chanda expressed his gratitude to the Chinese government and the Chinese people for their welcome and hospitality during their visit and performances.

Mr. Chanda told reporters that the Indian Cultural Delegation had visited many cities and seen many scenic spots and new things in China during their two-month stay, leaving them with indelible impressions.

When reporters asked Mr. Chanda about his impressions of the Chinese people's struggle to realize their first Five-Year Plan, he said: "My overall impression of your country is 'moving forward.'" The speed of construction in all aspects is astonishing. Because the Chinese people are not working for personal gain, but for the future of their country. Your cause is of great help to world progress. As sincere friends and neighbors, we admire it very much.

Reporters asked Mr. Chanda to share his views on strengthening friendly cooperation and cultural exchange between the peoples of China and India in the future. Mr. Chanda replied that to enhance the understanding between the peoples of China and India, it should be particularly mentioned that the two countries should exchange professors, students, and scholars in the future, and send delegations to each other on a larger scale than in the past. He believes that although there are difficulties in transportation and language, they will not be insurmountable. He believes that after a period of time, it will not be uncommon to meet Indians on the street.

Mr. Chanda finally said to the reporters: "Through you, I wish China and the Chinese people well. May New China achieve even greater achievements than in the past. The work you are currently engaged in is a great work related to the lives of nearly a quarter of humanity. I wish you success in your great construction."

    印度文化代表团团长钱达在广州谈访华观感
    新华社广州六日电　广州市新闻记者在六日访问了印度文化代表团团长阿尼尔·库马尔·钱达先生。
    钱达先生表示感谢中国政府和中国人民对他们的访问和演出的欢迎和款待。
    钱达先生对记者们说，印度文化代表团来华两个月内访问了不少城市，参观了很多名胜古迹和新的事物，使他们留下不可磨灭的印象。
    记者们问钱达先生对中国人民为实现第一个五年计划而奋斗的观感时，他说：我在你们国家所得到的总的印象就是“向前迈进”。你们各方面的建设速度是惊人的。因为中国人民不是为了个人赚钱，而是为自己的国家未来而工作。你们的事业对世界进步有很大帮助。作为诚恳的朋友和邻人，我们非常钦佩。
    记者请钱达先生谈谈今后加强中印两国人民的友好合作和文化交流的意见。钱达先生答道，要增进中印两国人民的了解，应该特别提到的，两个国家今后要互相交换教授、学生和学者，要互派代表团，而且规模要比过去更大。他认为，交通和语言虽有困难，但总是阻隔不了的。他相信再过一个时期，在街上碰见印度人并不是件稀奇的事。
    钱达先生最后向记者们说：我通过你们祝中国和中国人民好。祝新中国取得比过去更伟大的成就。你们目前所从事的工作是关系到将近人类四分之一的生活的巨大工作。祝你们在伟大的建设当中获得成功。
