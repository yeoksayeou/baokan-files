　　Organizing Private Merchants to Go to the Countryside for Procurement
　　By our reporter Ai Ling
    As the urban commercial off-season arrived, the state-owned commercial departments and the Administration for Industry and Commerce in Guangzhou organized private businesses to go to the countryside for procurement. They utilized the capital, manpower, and technical experience of private merchants to clear certain blockages in the urban-rural exchange of goods. This played a role in meeting the needs of people's production and life and helped private merchants overcome difficulties during the off-season. By the end of May, private merchants from seven industries, including Chinese medicine, mountain products, fresh fruits, vegetables, preserved fruits and seafood, and salted groceries, as well as some commission agents, participated in the program in Guangzhou. They formed more than forty groups and went to producing areas in mainland Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangsu, and other provinces, procuring goods worth a total of about 130,000 yuan.

    The circulation of certain goods in Guangdong was experiencing blockages. In rural areas, many local specialties were stockpiled in the hands of farmers. For example, the lizi bamboo in Zengcheng could not be sold, many Chinese medicinal materials had no buyers, and vegetables rotted due to prolonged stockpiling. Similarly, Chaozhou oranges, dried persimmons, and myrica candies in Shantou could not be sold either. These situations affected the lives of people in the producing areas; especially as Guangdong experienced a drought this spring, farmers were even more eager to sell the local specialties in their hands. In Guangzhou, however, many goods were in short supply. For example, beef bones, yellow wax, gypsum, dried persimmons, and dried longan pulp were in chronic shortage, affecting the production of many small urban producers and handicraft workers, as well as the people's lives. The shortage of beef bones affected the production of the button industry in the city and the lives of button industry workers. The shortage of Chinese medicine forced doctors to repeatedly change prescriptions, which affected not only the business of the Chinese medicine industry but also the treatment of patients. After organizing private merchants to go to the countryside for procurement, sales channels were opened for small-volume local products that were stockpiled in the producing areas, and some goods that had been out of stock for a long time reappeared in the Guangzhou market. Shantou had a large stockpile of Chaozhou oranges, and private merchants in Guangzhou purchased 100,000 jin after going to the countryside, selling all of them within just ten days after they were transported to Guangzhou. The Chinese medicine industry procured fifty or sixty kinds of local medicinal materials, including beehives, beeswax, water weng flowers, kudzu flowers, large pieces of San, and large pieces of Qi, all of which were out of stock or in short supply in Guangzhou.

    The state-owned commercial departments and the Administration for Industry and Commerce in Guangzhou adopted various forms of organizing private merchants to go to the countryside for procurement, such as allowing them to jointly purchase with state-owned commercial enterprises, having the Administration for Industry and Commerce and state-owned companies lead the procurement, and issuing procurement certificates. Before going to the countryside for procurement, they also helped private merchants understand the situation of goods sources and market supply in the producing areas. Appropriate consideration was given to prices, packaging, transportation, and sales. For some merchants who had real difficulties, banks provided loans. These forms of assistance guided the operation of private merchants, helped them overcome the difficulties of the off-season, and obtain reasonable profits. Business volume generally increased, and some private merchants went from losses to profits. The vegetable industry was the most difficult industry during the off-season. They always had little capital, no more than two hundred yuan at most, and only a few yuan at least. It was difficult to survive the off-season. After this procurement in the countryside, more than eighty batches of goods were purchased one after another, and the general business volume increased by 30%. The "Zhiji" vegetable shop did not participate in the procurement in the countryside. In early March, the turnover was only more than 250 yuan. After participating in the procurement, it increased to 806 yuan in early April, more than three times higher than before. In the preserved fruit and seafood industry, the April turnover of five shops was more than 65,500 yuan, which increased to more than 90,002 yuan in May. All five households suffered losses in March, only two households continued to suffer losses in April, and by May, not only was there no loss, but each household earned an average of more than 500 yuan. Other industries, such as native products and fresh fruits, had long-term losses. After participating in the procurement in the countryside, they obtained reasonable profits and reversed the losses.

    When the proposal to go to the countryside for procurement was first put forward, many private merchants had doubts and concerns. They suspected it was "a pipe dream," worried that they could not buy goods, or could only buy inferior or unsalable goods, feared slow capital turnover, and feared losses. In short, they were not active in going to the countryside for procurement and took an attitude of distrust toward state-owned commercial enterprises. After participating in the procurement in the countryside, they began to realize that it was beneficial to obey the leadership of state-owned commercial enterprises. Some private merchants even corrected their business attitudes, improved their business management, and expressed their willingness to further align with state-owned commercial enterprises and accept their leadership. Some private merchants who did not participate in the procurement in the countryside at first also asked to participate. Now, private merchants in some industries have formulated longer-term procurement plans for going to the countryside.

    However, the state-owned commercial departments and the Administration for Industry and Commerce in Guangzhou still have some serious shortcomings in organizing private merchants to go to the countryside for procurement. Generally speaking, they only paid attention to the arrangement and maintenance of private merchants, but neglected the transformation of private merchants; they have not yet accurately grasped the situation of goods sources and the market in the producing areas. Situations such as being unable to buy goods, buying only a small amount of goods, and the goods purchased not really being what the market urgently needs are also relatively serious. These issues need to be addressed in the future.

### 组织私商下乡采购

　　组织私商下乡采购
　　本报记者　艾玲
    城市商业淡季到来的时候，广州市国营商业部门和工商行政管理部门组织私营行业下乡采购，利用私商的资金、人力和技术经验，打通了某些物资城乡交流中的阻塞现象，对满足人民生产和生活上的需要起了一定的作用，并帮助私商渡过了淡季中的困难。到五月底止，广州市参加下乡的有国药、山货、鲜果、蔬菜、京果海味、咸杂等七个行业的私商以及部分行商。他们共组成四十多个小组，先后到广东内地、广西、湖南、江苏等产区，采购了总值约十三万元的货物。
    广东某些物资的流通是有阻塞现象的。在农村，许多土特产积压在农民手里。例如增城的篱竹推销不出去，许多土药材没有人收购，蔬菜因积压过久而腐烂。又如汕头的潮州柑、柿饼、杨梅胚也销不出去。这些，都影响产区人民的生活；特别是广东今年春旱，农民更迫切要求把手里的土特产卖出去。在广州，却有许多货物供不应求。例如牛骨、黄腊、石膏、柿饼、桂圆肉等都长期缺货，影响了许多城市小生产者和手工业者的生产和人民的生活。牛骨缺货，就影响了全市制钮业的生产和制钮业工人的生活。国药缺货，医生处方时不得不数次更改药品，不仅影响国药业的营业，也影响了对病人的治疗。组织私商下乡采购后，给产区积压的小宗土产打开了销路，使某些脱销已久的货物重新出现在广州市场上。汕头积压了很多潮州柑，广州私商下乡后收购了十万斤，运到广州后仅在十天内全部销出去。国药业采购了五、六十种土药材，其中蜂房、蜜蜡、水翁花、葛花、散大片、齐大片都是广州市脱销和供应不足的药品。
    广州市国营商业部门和工商行政部门对参加下乡采购的私商，分别采取让他们同国营商业联购、由工商行政部门和国营公司领导进行采购、持采购证等形式下乡采购。在下乡采购前，又帮助私商到产区了解货源情况和市场供应情况，在价格、包装、运输、销售等方面又给予适当照顾，对某些确有困难的商号，由银行给予贷款。这些帮助，指导了私商的经营，使私商渡过了淡季的困难，获得合理的利润，营业额普遍上升，有些私商从亏损走向盈利。蔬菜业在淡季中是最困难的行业，他们一向资金少，最多不过两百元，最少只有数元资金，淡季是难以渡过的。经过这次下乡采购，前后买到八十多批货，一般营业额上升了百分之三十。蔬菜业“志记”没有参加下乡采购前，三月上旬营业额仅二百五十多元，参加采购后，四月上旬增加到八百零六元，比以前增加了三倍多。京果海味业五户商号，四月份营业额六万五千五百多元，到五月份增加到九万零二元；三月份五户全部亏蚀，四月份只剩两户亏蚀，到五月份不仅没有亏蚀的，反而每户平均都赚了五百多元。其他如土产业，鲜果业等都是长期亏损，参加下乡采购后都获得了合理利润，扭转了亏损现象。
    开始提出下乡采购时，不少私商是有怀疑和顾虑的。他们怀疑是“一场春梦”，顾虑买不到货，或只能买到劣货、滞销货，怕资金周转慢，怕亏本。总之，对下乡采购并不积极，对国营商业采取不信任态度。在参加下乡采购后，才开始体会到服从国营商业的领导是有好处的。有的私商并端正经营态度，改善经营管理，表示要进一步靠拢国营商业，接受国营商业的领导。一些最初没有参加下乡采购的私商也要求参加。现在，有些行业的私商，已制定了较长期的下乡采购计划。
    但广州市国营商业部门和工商行政管理部门在组织私商下乡采购中还有一些严重缺点。一般说，对私商只注意了安排、维持，而忽视了对私商的改造；对产区的货源和市场的情况也还没有摸得很准，买不到货、只买到很少的货和买回来的货并不真是市场迫切需要的等情况也比较严重。这些，都有待于今后注意解决。
