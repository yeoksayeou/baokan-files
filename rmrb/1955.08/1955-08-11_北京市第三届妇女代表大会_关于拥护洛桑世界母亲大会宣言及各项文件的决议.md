    The Third Beijing Municipal Women's Congress heard a report from Li Dequan, head of the Chinese delegation to the World Mothers' Congress, on the situation and achievements of the congress. We unanimously endorse and fully support the declaration and various documents of the World Mothers' Congress, and warmly celebrate the achievements of the World Mothers' Congress.
    The World Mothers' Congress fully demonstrated the will of hundreds of millions of mothers to protect children's lives and safeguard world peace. "We don't want war," this is the determination that mothers from all countries have declared to the world through this congress.
    The World Mothers' Congress expressed legitimate expectations for the Four-Power Summit; mothers from all countries hope that the United Nations can fulfill the provisions of the United Nations Charter. They appealed to the heads of the four powers and to the United Nations: it is imperative to stop war preparations, universally reduce armaments, ban atomic weapons, use atomic energy for peaceful purposes, resolve international disputes through negotiations, and protect the growing generation from war.
    The World Mothers' Congress called on mothers all over the world to unite as one and bravely take on the cause of safeguarding peace as a sacred duty to nurture their children.
    We, the mothers and women of Beijing, hate war and love peace, just like the people of the whole country. Almost 100% of adult women in the city enthusiastically participated in the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons, which fully demonstrates the strong will for peace of Beijing women. We are actively participating in and striving to support the peaceful construction of the motherland, creating a better future for our children. We will never allow anyone to use war to destroy our happy life.
    The Congress calls on all women and mothers in Beijing, together with the people of the whole country, to fully support our government's peaceful foreign policy, strive to complete the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, strive for an international peaceful environment, strengthen the friendship between women and mothers of all countries, and contribute all our strength to the realization of the resolutions of the World Mothers' Congress. August 1955

    关于拥护洛桑世界母亲大会宣言及各项文件的决议
    北京市第三届妇女代表大会听取了出席世界母亲大会的中国代表团李德全团长关于大会情况和成就的传达报告。我们一致拥护和全力支持世界母亲大会的宣言及各项文件，并热烈庆贺世界母亲大会的成就。
    世界母亲大会充分显示了亿万母亲保卫儿童生命、保卫世界和平的意志。“我们不要战争”，这就是各国母亲们通过这次大会向全世界宣布的决心。
    世界母亲大会对四国首脑会议表示了正当的期望；各国母亲们希望联合国能履行联合国宪章的规定。她们向四国首脑、向联合国呼吁：必须停止战争准备，普遍裁减军备，禁止原子武器，把原子能用于和平目的，以谈判方式解决国际争端，保卫正在成长的一代免遭战争。
    世界母亲大会号召全世界的母亲们团结一致，把保卫和平的事业，当作抚育孩子的神圣职责一样，勇敢地担当起来。
    我们北京市的母亲和妇女，和全国人民一样憎恨战争，热爱和平。全市几乎百分之百的成年妇女踊跃地参加了关于反对使用原子武器的签名运动，这充分表示了北京市妇女坚强的和平意志。我们正在积极参加和努力支持祖国的和平建设，为孩子们创造更加美好的未来。我们决不允许有人用战争来破坏我们幸福的生活。
    大会号召全北京市的妇女和母亲们同全国人民一起，全力支持我国政府的和平外交政策，努力完成祖国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，争取国际和平环境，加强各国妇女和母亲间的友谊，为实现世界母亲大会的决议而贡献出一切力量。　一九五五年八月
