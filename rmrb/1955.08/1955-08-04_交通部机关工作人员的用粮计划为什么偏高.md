Every Collective Mess Unit Must Save Grain

Why is the Grain Consumption Plan for Staff of the Ministry of Communications Too High?

Lin Gang

At the Beijing Grain Conservation Exhibition, there is an eye-catching cartoon: A staff member, holding high a grain purchase plan, goes to ask the head for approval. The plan states that the unit consumes an average of 32 and a half steamed buns and 15 bowls of rice per person per day. The head, buried in a document on the desk, without even looking up, "approves" the plan; he hands a large stamp to the person, letting him stamp it himself.

Don't think this is just an exaggeration by the cartoonist. There are still many irresponsible "responsible comrades" who carelessly "approve" plans that waste state grain. Currently, the grain consumption plans of many collective mess units in government agencies and enterprises are set too high, one reason being that the Party organizations and administrative heads of those units have not given due attention to grain conservation work.

The Ministry of Communications is one example. The Beijing Municipal People's Committee stipulates that all government agencies, enterprises, and other collective mess units should supply grain according to formal household registration from July. This measure is to plug loopholes in grain waste and better comply with the state's grain policy. Many government agencies and enterprises in Beijing, based on each staff member meticulously calculating their individual grain consumption plan, have made their unit's grain consumption plan more realistic. However, the July grain consumption plan figures for the Ministry of Communications staff (773 people eating in the agency cafeteria, with the agency issuing grain plan certificates) exceeded the actual grain consumption figures by 4,277 jin! This means that this unit over-reported and fraudulently obtained more than 4,200 jin of grain from the state at the beginning of July!

What is the reason for the high plan?

Grain conservation work is a political and mass-based undertaking that requires mobilizing all the people to conscientiously implement the state's grain policy. Therefore, in-depth and meticulous ideological education must be carried out so that all staff members understand the political significance of the state's planned grain supply and grain conservation, and so that everyone understands the relationship between their own grain consumption plan and socialist construction. The Party Committee of the Ministry of Communications has precisely relaxed ideological work in grain conservation work. The method used by this unit to formulate the grain consumption plan is: "Individual self-reporting, departmental review, leadership approval." On the surface, this method seems very complete. In reality, they are treating this major task as general administrative work. They only "mentioned" the regulations of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee on grain conservation in a branch secretary joint meeting that discussed other work, and then the director of the General Office made a 30-minute mobilization broadcast; after that, as Party Committee staff member Zhang Xuelin said: they pushed the grain conservation work to the "people in charge of eating."

When staff members formulate their individual grain consumption plans, they do not understand its relationship with the country's socialist construction, naturally they do not pay attention to this "small matter," and cannot formulate a good plan. I have studied with nearly 20 staff members from eight departments and offices the reasons why their individual grain consumption plans are set too high. In summary, there are only two points: one is that they do not attach importance to it ideologically, and the attitude of formulating the plan is relatively careless. Some people did not even hear the broadcast mobilization report of the director of the General Office clearly; some people think this is a "troublesome thing," "three or two jin more is inevitable, how can it be so accurate"; some people have no idea how much they eat in a month, and do not bother to find out, so they roughly set the plan; in some departments and offices, one person sets 37 jin, and a dozen people all set 37 jin. Another reason is that they do not understand the grain policy, have concerns, are afraid of not having enough to eat, and hold the attitude of "rather have too much than not enough," intentionally being generous. Many staff members calculate their food intake not according to the average, but according to the highest standard of consumption per meal; some comrades never eat in the cafeteria on Sundays, but calculate according to eating in the cafeteria for 31 days a month; some individual grain consumption plans even have "contingency grain."

Without earnestly doing ideological education work, "individual self-reporting" is carried out, and the result is generally too high. In July, the average grain consumption per person in Beijing's government agencies was 29 jin, but the average planned grain consumption per person in the Ministry of Communications was 34 and a half jin. The cafeteria manager made a statistic that there were 391 people whose individual planned grain consumption was between 30 jin and 49 jin (of which, 109 people were between 30 jin and 34 jin, 173 people were between 35 jin and 39 jin, and 109 people were between 40 jin and 49 jin), accounting for more than half of the number of people eating in the agency cafeteria.

These individual grain consumption plans, which are obviously unreasonably high at first glance, have all safely passed the "review" of the responsible comrades of the departments and offices.

The Inland Waterway Navigation Planning Committee has four trainees, and their individual grain consumption plans are obviously too high. Take a look: Zhang Zongkang and Yuan Shiliang each have 46 jin, Wang Peijun (female) has 41 jin, and Du Meiling (female) has 37 jin. They just returned from a business trip to Hankou on the 16th, and only ate in the agency cafeteria for half a month in July, but they all set the grain consumption plan for the entire month. However, these plans were all personally signed and approved by the director of the office, Feng Wenzhi. After investigation, it turned out that Director Feng first signed his name on a blank sheet of paper, and then the trainees filled in the plan and sent it to the cafeteria. What kind of "review" is this? Isn't this the same working method used by the head in the cartoon? (These four people's plans were later lowered by the cafeteria.)

The Confidentiality Division has seven female comrades, and the individual planned grain consumption numbers are all 32 jin and 33 jin. Could it be that these female comrades eat particularly much? The inspection team of the Dongsi District Grain Conservation Committee conducted an investigation. It turned out that they themselves originally set it at 24 jin to 26 jin. They are all from the south, and the amount of rice needed in the plan is more, and the amount of flour is less (under normal circumstances, eating rice requires fewer jin than eating flour). It was Zhu Qicheng, the head of the code translation group, who took these plans to the division chief for approval. When he saw that the flour figures on the plan were less than the figures stipulated by Beijing for supplying grain to the staff of the agency, he rashly increased them all by eight or nine jin. However, these plans, which were raised to more than 30 jin out of thin air, were also approved by Liu Tiejun, the head of the Confidentiality Division and the secretary of the Party branch. These female comrades really couldn't eat so much, and before the end of the month, they returned the grain coupons to the cafeteria one after another, some returning 10 jin, and some returning eight or nine jin.

The personal grain consumption plans of the staff of the Personnel Department are generally too high, and the reason must also be found from the leadership. Take a look at how the plan of Deputy Director Li Xingchang was formulated and approved. One day, Shan Chongjie, a clerk in the department, went to him and said: "Director, everyone has to make a grain consumption plan for July." Deputy Director Li said: "You make it for me." The clerk said: "How do I know how much you eat?" Deputy Director Li said: "I can't say how much I eat either. Write down how much you eat." Shan Chongjie is a young man who eats 35 jin a month, so he wrote down that much for Li Xingchang. This grain consumption plan made by someone else was also smoothly "reviewed" and approved by the section chief.

If the leaders and staff of the departments and offices do not attach importance to grain conservation work, the "department and office review" becomes empty words.

Finally, what is the real situation of the so-called "leadership approval"? The director of the Administrative Office puts his stamp in the hands of the cafeteria manager, who is fully responsible for reviewing the grain consumption plans of the staff who eat in the agency cafeteria and issuing certificates. Needless to say, the director of the Administrative Office's practice of handing over his stamp to the manager is fundamentally wrong. The two key tasks of "individual self-reporting" and "department and office review" have not been done well, and it is unimaginable to rely on the manager to correct the high phenomenon. Some plans that seem too high have been "reviewed" and signed by the responsible comrades of the departments and offices, and the manager is embarrassed to "send them back." Therefore, except for those that are really unreasonably high, they are generally approved. This is how the July plan for the staff of the Ministry of Communications was formulated.

State organs should become a model for grain conservation. In July, the Ministry of Communications over-reported and fraudulently obtained more than 4,200 jin of grain from the state. This is the government agency with the highest over-reporting figures in Dongsi District, Beijing. The seriousness of this behavior of not strictly abiding by the state's grain policy goes without saying. Now, the Party organization and administrative leadership of the Ministry of Communications have attached importance to and are taking measures to correct this shortcoming.

### 交通部机关工作人员的用粮计划为什么偏高

专栏：每个集体伙食单位都要节约粮食

    交通部机关工作人员的用粮计划为什么偏高
    林钢
    北京市节约粮食展览会上有一幅引人注意的漫画：一个工作人员，两手高擎着购粮计划，去请首长批核。计划上写着，这个单位平均每人每天吃馒头三十二个半，米饭十五碗。那位首长埋头于桌上的一纸公文，头也不抬，就“批准”了计划；他顺手把一枚大图章递给来人，让他自己去盖印。
    不要以为这只不过是漫画家的夸张。目前还有不少这样漫不经心地“批准”了浪费国家粮食的计划的不负责任的“负责同志”。目前还有许多机关、企业的集体伙食单位的用粮计划定的偏高，原因之一就是那些单位的党组织和行政方面的负责人对节约粮食工作没有予以应有的重视。
    交通部机关就是一个例子。北京市人民委员会规定，全市各机关、企业等集体伙食单位从七月份起按正式户口供应粮食。采取这一措施，是为了堵塞浪费粮食的漏洞，更好地遵守国家的粮食政策。北京市许多机关、企业在每个工作人员精打细算制定个人用粮计划的基础上，把本单位的用粮计划定得更切合实际了。可是，交通部工作人员（在机关食堂吃饭，由机关开具用粮计划证明信的七百七十三人）的七月份用粮计划数字，比实际用粮数字高出了四千二百七十七斤！这就是说，这个单位在七月初向国家浮报冒领了四千二百多斤粮食！
    计划偏高的原因在那里呢？
    节约粮食工作，是要动员全体人民来认真贯彻国家粮食政策的政治性、群众性的工作。因此，必须进行深入细致的思想教育，让全体工作人员懂得国家粮食计划供应和节约粮食的政治意义，让每一个人懂得自己制定用粮计划同社会主义建设的关系。交通部机关党委在节约粮食工作中恰恰放松了思想工作。这个单位制定用粮计划的办法是：“个人自报，科室审核，领导批准”。从表面上看来，这个办法很完善。实际上，他们是把这个重大的工作当作一般事务工作来处理的。他们对于北京市人民委员会关于节约粮食的规定，只是在一次讨论其他工作的支部书记联席会议上附带“讲了一下”，以后又由办公厅主任在广播中作了三十分钟的动员；再以后，正如党委会工作人员张雪林所说：就把节约粮食工作推给“管吃饭的人”去做了。
    工作人员在制定个人用粮计划的时候，不懂得它同国家进行社会主义建设的关系，自然不重视这件“小事”，不能定好计划了。我曾和八个科、室的将近二十名工作人员共同研究了他们的个人用粮计划定得偏高的原因。总括起来，不外两点：一是思想上不重视，制定计划的态度比较草率马虎。有些人连办公厅主任的广播动员报告都没有听清楚；有些人认为这是“麻烦事”，“多三斤二斤难免，那能那么准确”；有的人对于自己一月吃多少心中无数，也不弄清楚，就大概定了计划；有些科、室，有一个人定三十七斤，十来个人就都定三十七斤。另一个原因是对粮食政策不了解，有顾虑，怕不够吃，抱着“宁有余，勿不足”的态度，有意宽打窄用。许多工作人员计算食量时不是按平均数，而是按每顿用量的最高标准；有些同志星期日从来不在食堂吃饭，也按每月在食堂吃三十一天计算；有的个人用粮计划里竟然还有“机动粮”。
    没有认真做好思想教育工作就进行“个人自报”，报的结果就普遍偏高。七月份北京市各机关平均每人用粮数是二十九斤，交通部机关每人平均计划用粮数却是三十四斤半。食堂管理员作了一个统计，个人计划用粮三十斤到四十九斤的共有三百九十一人（其中，三十斤到三十四斤的有一百零九人，三十五斤到三十九斤的有一百七十三人，四十斤到四十九斤的有一百零九人），占在机关食堂吃饭人数的一半以上。
    这些一眼就看得出来高得不合情理的个人用粮计划，都平安无事地通过了科、室负责同志的“审核”。
    内河航运规划委员会有四个练习生，他们的个人用粮计划显然是高了。请看：张宗康、袁世良各四十六斤，王佩珺（女）四十一斤，杜美玲（女）三十七斤。他们十六日刚从汉口出差回来，七月份实际在机关食堂只吃半个月饭，定的却都是全月的用粮计划。但这些计划都由办公室主任冯闻智亲笔签字批准了。后经调查，原来是冯主任先把名字签在白纸上，然后由练习生们填了计划送给食堂的。这是什么样的“审核”呢？这不是和漫画上的那位首长用的是同样的工作方法吗？（这四个人的计划后来被食堂压低了。）
    机要处有七个女同志，个人计划用粮数都是三十二斤、三十三斤。难道这些女同志就是吃得特别多吗？东四区节约粮食委员会的检查组作了调查。原来她们自己定的本来都是二十四斤到二十六斤。她们都是南方人，计划中需要大米的数量多，面粉少（一般情况下吃大米要比吃面粉的斤数少）。把这些计划拿给处长去批的是译电组长朱启程。他看见计划上面粉数字不足北京市规定供应给机关工作人员的数字，便冒冒失失地都给增加了八、九斤不等。但是，这些凭空提高到三十多斤的计划也都由机要处长、党的支部书记刘铁军批准了。这些女同志实在吃不了这么多，不到月底，纷纷向食堂退回粮票，有退十斤的，有退八、九斤的。
    人事司工作人员的个人用粮计划普遍偏高，原因也要从领导方面找。请看副司长李兴昌的计划是怎样制定和被批准的。一天，司里的办事员单崇杰去找他，说：“司长，七月份每人要做用粮计划。”李副司长说：“你给我做吧。”办事员说：“我怎么知道你吃多少？”李副司长说：“我也说不出我吃多少。你们吃多少，就给我写多少吧。”单崇杰是个小伙子，一月吃三十五斤，就给李兴昌也写下了这么多。这份别人代定的用粮计划送给科长也顺利地
  “审核”批准了。
    科、室领导工作人员不重视节约粮食工作，
  “科室审核”就成了一句空话。
    最后，所谓“领导批准”的真实情况是怎样的呢？行政处长把他的图章放在食堂管理员那里，由管理员全权审核在机关食堂吃饭的工作人员的用粮计划，盖章签发证明信。不用说行政处长把自己的图章交给管理员的作法是根本错误的。“个人自报”“科室审核”这两个关键性的工作没有做好，要靠管理员来纠正偏高现象是难以想像的。有些看来偏高的计划，科、室负责同志都“审核”签了字，管理员也不好意思“打回去”。所以，除了那些高得实在不合情理的以外，一般都照准了。交通部机关工作人员七月份计划就是这样制定出来的。
    国家机关应当成为节约粮食的榜样。交通部机关在七月份却向国家浮报冒领了四千二百多斤粮食。这是北京市东四区浮报数字最高的一个机关。这种不严格遵守国家粮食政策的行为的严重性是不消多说的。现在，交通部机关的党组织和行政领导方面已经重视并正在采取措施纠正这个缺点。
