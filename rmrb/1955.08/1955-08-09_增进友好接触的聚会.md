Today, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Bulganin, held a grand reception at the picturesque Semenov Villa, 100 kilometers south of Moscow. Bulganin, Kaganovich, Malenkov, Mikoyan, Molotov, Pervukhin, Suslov, Khrushchev, as well as various secretaries of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and many responsible personnel from the Soviet government and military, and many representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union attended. Ambassadors from Eastern and Western countries to the Soviet Union were invited to participate. Representatives from Soviet and foreign news media were also invited to attend. At this reception, the Soviet Party and government leaders, through their cordial hospitality to the guests, expressed their sincerity in continuously striving to promote international harmony and mutual trust. People from all social systems felt this sincerity and found the political atmosphere to be particularly peaceful. Many diplomats and journalists stated that such a reception was unprecedented and extremely beneficial.

The reception began at 2:00 PM. It was a Sunday. Many cars drove from Moscow to the destination at noon. Along the way, the yellowing wheat fields and green patches of pine and birch forests brought people the beautiful scenery of the Russian countryside.

The Semenov Villa is located in a dense forest, and the banquet was held under tents in the forest. After the hosts invited the guests to be seated, they dined while listening to music. The Soviet Union's most famous singers, pianists, and actors performed a series of wonderful performances.

People from Eastern and Western countries talked and clinked glasses. Pleasant singing, the fragrance of plants, and a harmonious atmosphere filled the room. As the banquet was drawing to a close, Comrade Bulganin rose and asked everyone to fill their glasses. He said that he was very happy to spend the day with everyone in this beautiful place. He thanked everyone for coming to the gathering. The spirit of friendship established in Geneva made such gatherings possible. Gatherings like today's will be more frequent in the future, so that all representatives of Eastern and Western countries can have the opportunity to meet in a friendly atmosphere. Bulganin asked everyone to toast international reconciliation and mutual trust, and expressed his hope that such gatherings would be held more often in the future. Comrade Khrushchev joked: The more such gatherings, the better, as long as they don't affect work. His sense of humor aroused laughter from the audience. The Ambassador of Burma, U Ohn, in his capacity as the head of the diplomatic corps in the Soviet Union, expressed his gratitude, believing that the atmosphere of peace had been strengthened.

After the banquet, the Soviet Party and government leaders led the guests to watch a match between the Soviet "Spartak" football team and the British football team at the "Dynamo" stadium for a while on television, and then took the guests to tour the villa, which is surrounded by forests and connected to several large ponds. The clear sky and azure forest screen were reflected in the mirror-like pond water, creating a charming beauty. Fishing rods were placed by the pond for people to fish. A female guest caught ten carp, each three fingers wide, in a short while. There were also rowing boats by the pond. Comrade Molotov rowed a small boat, carrying the Argentine Ambassador Bravo and the wife of the Indonesian Ambassador, Subandrio. He said with a smile, "Goodbye, rowing to Indonesia." Comrade Mikoyan also rowed a small boat, carrying three guests—the family of the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Bohlen. The actions of the Soviet Party and government leaders became the focus of the reporters' lenses. British and American reporters took photos of Comrade Khrushchev in the fields. The Burmese Ambassador, U Ohn, took photos of Khrushchev and Tevosyan. Kaganovich, Malenkov, Pervukhin, and actors Obraztsov and Kozlovsky took pictures together.

As the sun gradually set, the Soviet Party and government leaders, without showing any fatigue, joined the guests in singing by the pond, singing "March of the Volunteers" under the direction of Soviet People's Artist Rezen. The wife of the Indonesian Ambassador and Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, Shepilov, also sang songs.

It was not until 8:00 PM that the guests and hosts shook hands and said goodbye with great joy. Upon returning to the brightly lit Moscow, the scene of this reception, which symbolized the increasingly easing international situation, remained in people's minds for a long time. (August 7th)

    增进友好接触的聚会
  　本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁今天在莫斯科南方一百公里风景如画的谢绵诺夫别墅举行了盛大的招待会。布尔加宁、卡冈诺维奇、马林科夫、米高扬、莫洛托夫、别尔乌辛、苏斯洛夫、赫鲁晓夫，以及苏联共产党中央委员会各书记、苏联政府和军队的许多负责人员、苏联最高苏维埃的许多代表都出席了。被邀参加的有东西方各国驻苏联的使节。苏联和外国的新闻界代表也被邀参加。在这个招待会上，苏联党和政府领导者们经过对客人的亲切款待，表示了不断为促进国际的和睦和互相信任而努力的诚意。不论来自什么社会制度的人们，都感触到这种诚意，而觉得政治空气是格外平和。许多外交官和记者都表示这样的招待会是空前的，是非常有益的。
    招待会在下午二时开始。这是星期天。许多汽车在中午都从莫斯科驰向目的地。沿途麦黄草绿、一片片松林和白桦林带给人们俄罗斯农村的美丽景色。
    谢绵诺夫别墅座落在浓密的森林中，宴席就设在林中的帐篷下。主人招待客人们入座后，一面进餐，一面演奏音乐。苏联最有名的歌唱家、钢琴家和演员进行了一连串精彩的表演。
    东西方国家的人们交谈着，碰着杯。悦耳的歌声，草木的芳香和融洽的气氛一起洋溢在席间。在宴会快结束的时候，布尔加宁同志起来请大家把酒杯倒满。他说，很高兴和大家一起在这美丽的地方过一天。感谢大家来聚会。在日内瓦建立的友好精神，使得这样的聚会成为可能。像今天这样聚会将来会更多，使东西方国家的所有代表能有机会在友好的气氛中接触。布尔加宁请大家为国际的和好和互相信任干杯并表示希望今后多多举行这样的聚会。赫鲁晓夫同志开玩笑说：这样的聚会越多越好，只是不要影响工作。他的幽默感引起了满座笑声。缅甸大使吴旺以各国驻苏外交团团长的身份表示谢意，认为和平的气氛是加强了。
    宴会结束了，苏联党政领导者们领客人们到电视机前看了一会苏联“斯巴达”足球队和英国足球队在“狄纳莫”运动场的比赛，然后带客人们游览别墅，这个别墅在森林环抱中，衔连着几个大池塘。晴朗的天空和蔚蓝的林屏，倒映在镜子似的池水里，构成迷人的美景。池边放着鱼竿供人垂钓。有一位女客人不一会儿就钓上了十尾三个指头宽的鲤鱼。池边也横着双桨的小船。莫洛托夫同志划一只小船，上面载着阿根廷大使布拉沃和印度尼西亚大使苏班德里奥夫人，他含笑地说：“再见，划到印度尼西亚去。”米高扬同志也划着一只小船，上面载着三个客人——美驻苏大使波伦的一家人。苏联党政领导者们的举动成为记者们的镜头的焦点。英美记者围着赫鲁晓夫同志在田间拍了照。缅甸大使吴旺为赫鲁晓夫和捷沃西安同志摄了影。卡冈诺维奇、马林科夫、别尔乌辛和演员奥布拉兹卓夫、科兹洛夫斯基等人一起照了相。
    太阳渐渐西沉，苏联党政领导者们还毫无倦容地在池边和客人们合唱，在苏联人民演员雷真指挥下合唱了“祖国进行曲”。印度尼西亚大使夫人和苏共中央书记谢皮洛夫都唱了歌曲。
    直到下午八时，客人们和主人们才尽欢地握手告别。回到灯光辉煌的莫斯科的时候，这一天象征国际局势日益缓和的招待会的情景，还长久地留在人们心中。　（八月七日）
