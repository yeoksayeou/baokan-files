　　Making Pulp from Sugarcane Bagasse
　　Liao Yulong
    Under the help and guidance of Soviet experts, the state-owned Guangzhou Paper Mill began to study the use of sugarcane bagasse to make pulp in October 1952. Now it has been successfully researched and has recently begun production.
    Sugarcane bagasse is the waste left over from sugar making. In the past, it was burned as firewood; and because its heating power and durability are not as good as coal, the price was very cheap, and people rarely paid attention to it. Now, this "waste" has become a valuable raw material for papermaking. The results of the Guangzhou Paper Mill's trial production show that the quality of pulp made from sugarcane bagasse is better than reed pulp. It can be used not only to make newsprint and letterpress paper, but also to make higher-grade writing paper, and the cost is 20% lower than reed pulp.
    The successful trial production of sugarcane bagasse pulp has opened up new material sources for the papermaking industry. In the past, China mostly used wood to make pulp, which not only made the cost of paper high, but also because China's forest resources were insufficient, wood should be used as much as possible in the most necessary places, while the source of sugarcane bagasse is very abundant. China has about 2.5 million tons of sugarcane bagasse every year. Guangdong Province alone has more than 800,000 tons every year. It can be used to make 400,000 tons of pulp, replacing more than 2 million cubic meters of wood. Moreover, in the past, the wood used by Guangzhou Paper Mill to make pulp had to be transported from Fujian, Guangxi, Dayu Mountain, and other places. Now, using sugarcane bagasse to make pulp can take materials locally, and a lot of freight can be reduced every year.

　  用甘蔗渣制造纸浆
　　廖玉龙
    国营广州造纸厂在苏联专家帮助和指导下，从一九五二年十月开始研究用甘蔗渣制造纸浆，现在已经研究成功，最近已经开始生产。
    甘蔗渣是制糖剩下来的废物，过去一直是当柴烧掉的；而且因为它的火力和耐烧程度都比不上煤炭，所以价格很贱，人们很少去注意它。现在，这种“废物”变成了宝贵的造纸原料。广州造纸厂试制的结果证明，甘蔗渣制造的纸浆质量比苇浆好，不但可以用来制造新闻纸、凸版纸，而且可以制造较高级的书写纸，成本也比苇浆低百分之二十。
    甘蔗渣试制纸浆成功，为造纸工业开辟了新的材料来源。过去我国多采用木材制造纸浆，不但纸的成本高，而且由于我国的森林资源不足，应该尽量把木材用在最必需的地方，而甘蔗渣的来源却很丰富。我国的甘蔗渣每年约有二百五十万吨。仅广东一省每年就有八十多万吨。能够制造四十万吨纸浆，代替二百多万立方公尺的木材。而且，过去广州造纸厂制造纸浆的木材要从福建、广西、大庾岭等地运来，现在利用甘蔗渣制造纸浆，就可以就地取材，每年还可以减少许多运费。
