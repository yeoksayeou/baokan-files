Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: Recently, saving food has become a frequent topic of conversation among urban residents in their daily lives. After mass publicity and education against wasting food, the vast majority of urban residents have begun to arrange their family's food consumption with a spirit of thrift.

　　In Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and some small and medium-sized cities in Zhejiang, Hunan and other provinces, the majority of residents have successively formulated grain consumption plans by family units in recent months. In Shanghai, 1.2 million households have set up grain consumption plans. After discussing the issue of saving food, Party members throughout the city took the lead in revising their grain consumption plans. Many residents held family meetings to formulate practical grain consumption plans. In Hangzhou, 120,000 households have set up grain consumption plans. More than 100 factories in Shenyang have formulated plans to save food throughout the year. Some residents in Tianjin and Chongqing have formulated covenants for saving food to ensure the implementation of their grain consumption plans. In the conservation activities, many residents, after careful calculation, voluntarily proposed to reduce their grain supply. In Nanjing's Second District and Wuhu, more than 6,800 households requested a reduction in their supply. Housewives and cooks from organizations, groups, factories, and schools have been mobilized to save food. Women's representative conferences were held successively throughout Shanghai and in various districts. Housewives Zhang Xiguang, Du Youmei, and the women from Gaofuli on Ruijin First Road and Qingshunli shared their experiences in improving cooking methods to save food with many housewives. The "raw rice steaming method" of the Sichuan University cooks, which saves food, has been welcomed by more than 100 canteens in Chengdu and by colleagues in Beijing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Heilongjiang and other places. Before the end of June, the Chongqing Grain Bureau had received more than 70 letters from citizens introducing methods to save food. There are also more than 300 activists for saving food in Daxi Gou, Chongqing, who mobilized the residents. According to surveys, the average consumption of grain by 1,377,700 residents in Beijing who set up grain consumption plans in June was 25.42 catties per person. The average family grain consumption plan for cadres above the level of residents' group leaders in Shanghai's 19 districts in June was 23.97 catties per person.

　　During the mass movement to save food, the CCP committees and People's Committees in various cities and towns conducted in-depth publicity and education work among the vast residents. The total number of cadres and resident activists participating in this work in various cities reached hundreds of thousands. Before residents in Tianjin began formulating their grain consumption plans in July, more than 45,000 reporters, propagandists, and grain workers went to various streets and alleys to report to residents on saving food. Several thousand cadres and resident activists were trained in cities such as Nanjing, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Guiyang. Before the end of June, more than 250,000 people in Changsha heard reports on saving food at more than 650 gatherings. More than 800 Party propagandists in various districts of the city also organized propaganda teams to promote saving food to residents in the streets and alleys. The "Save Food Exhibition" held in Beijing vividly educated the vast residents. To date, more than 170,000 people have visited the exhibition. The democratic women's federations at all levels in Shanghai played an important role in organizing women's activities to save food. Cities such as Beijing, Chongqing, Chengde, and Shijiazhuang held conferences to exchange experiences in saving food, or held representative conferences to commend advanced figures in saving food.
