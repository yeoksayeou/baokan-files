Xinhua News Agency, London, August 27th, TASS dispatch: The British Peace Committee issued a statement on the 26th, calling on all British citizens and people's organizations to strive for the success of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to be held in Geneva.

The statement said: "It must be remembered that the convening of the Geneva Summit Conference, which decided to hold this meeting, was the result of continuous pressure from the public in many countries. ... The Summit Conference marks a new and more hopeful stage in relations between the great powers. However, the difficulty of reaching practical agreements must not be underestimated."

Therefore, the British Peace Committee calls on all groups and individuals to intensify their activities and invites them to participate in the National Lobby Day on October 25th – the first day of the resumption of the British Parliament – to demand that Members of Parliament ensure that "mutually agreed solutions are reached on all issues raised for discussion" at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference.

　　英国和委会号召促使四国外长会议成功
    新华社二十八日讯　塔斯社伦敦二十七日讯：英国和平委员会在二十六日发表声明，号召英国全体公民和人民团体为即将在日内瓦举行的四国外长会议的成功而努力。
    声明说：“必须记住，决定举行这次会议的日内瓦政府首脑会议的召开是许多国家的公众不断保持压力的结果。……政府首脑会议标志着大国关系中一个新的和更有希望的阶段。但是，决不可轻视达成实际协议的困难。”
    因此，英国和平委员会号召一切团体和个人加紧他们的活动，并且邀请他们参加十月二十五日——英国议会复会的第一天——的全国院外运动日，要求议员们务使在四国外长会议中“提出讨论的各项问题上取得一致同意的解决办法”。
