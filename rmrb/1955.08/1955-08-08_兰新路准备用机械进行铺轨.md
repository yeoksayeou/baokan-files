    The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway track-laying project continues to advance westward. Currently, more than 90 percent of the roadbed construction has been completed for the fifty-plus kilometers from Shandan to Zhangye. The main structure of dozens of bridges and culverts has also been mostly completed, and construction workers are erecting pre-fabricated concrete beams on the newly built piers. The vanguard of the track-laying project is not far from Zhangye.

    The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is also preparing to use machinery for track laying. The first track-spiking factory in our country, built along the railway line, has already begun production. This factory pre-fabricates the rails, sleepers, and various accessories into trapezoidal finished products, which are then installed onto the roadbed using a track-laying machine. A series of processes in this factory are operated mechanically.

    After the implementation of mechanized track laying, the construction progress of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway will be greatly accelerated, the heavy physical labor of the track-laying workers will be completely eliminated, and the labor force can be reduced by more than half.

    兰新路准备用机械进行铺轨
    兰新铁路铺轨工程继续向西前进。现在，从山丹到张掖五十多公里的路基工程已经完成百分之九十以上，几十座桥涵的主体工程大部分也已修好，筑路工人正在新建的桥墩上架设混凝土成品梁。铺轨工程的前锋已经离张掖不远。
    兰新铁路还准备用机械铺轨。沿线建立的我国第一座钉道工厂已经开始生产。这座工厂是把铁轨、枕木和各种配件，预制成梯形的成品，然后用铺轨机安装到路基上。这座工厂里的一系列工序都是用机械操作的。
    实行机械化铺轨后，兰新铁路的建设进度将可大大加快，铺轨工人的繁重体力劳动就可全部消灭，而劳动力可节省一半以上。　（据新华社讯）
