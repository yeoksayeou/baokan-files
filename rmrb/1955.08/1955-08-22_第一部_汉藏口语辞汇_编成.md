The first draft of China's first "Chinese-Tibetan Spoken Language Lexicon" has been completed by the First Teaching and Research Group (Tibetan Language Teaching and Research Group) of the Chinese Department of the Central Institute for Nationalities. It is expected to be available to readers this year or early next year.

This "Chinese-Tibetan Spoken Language Lexicon" contains more than 10,000 entries. Its characteristics are: all Chinese words mainly adopt commonly used words in Beijing spoken language. Only when there is no suitable word to express the Tibetan meaning, other dialects or simple classical Chinese explanations are used. The Tibetan language uses commonly used words in Lhasa spoken language and some frequently quoted idioms.

This lexicon can be consulted from several aspects: Chinese phonetic symbols, Chinese characters, Tibetan pronunciation, and Tibetan characters. Both Chinese and Tibetan people can use it to learn Tibetan and Chinese.

This lexicon was completed through the cooperation of Chinese and Tibetan teachers from the First Teaching and Research Group of the Chinese Department of the Central Institute for Nationalities after more than two years of effort. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　第一部“汉藏口语辞汇”编成
    中国第一部“汉藏口语辞汇”的编纂，已由中央民族学院语文系第一教研组（藏语教研组）完成初稿。预计今年或明年初可同读者见面。
    这部“汉藏口语辞汇”有辞一万多条。它的特点是：所有汉语的词，主要是采用北京口语中通用的词，如果没有适当的词表达藏语含义时，才采用其他方言或浅近文言解释。藏语采用拉萨口语中通用的词，和一些经常引用的成语。
    这部辞汇，可以从汉语的注音符号、汉字、藏音、藏字几方面查用，汉藏两族人民学习藏语、汉语，都可以利用。
    这部辞汇是由中央民族学院语文系第一教研组汉藏两个民族教师合作，经过两年多的努力才完成的。　（新华社）
