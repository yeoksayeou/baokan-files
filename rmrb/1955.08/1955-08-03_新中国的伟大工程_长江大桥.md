New China's Great Project—The Yangtze River Bridge
By our reporter Cao Baoming

I.

The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project, for which the Chinese people have longed, has now begun! The Han River Railway Bridge, a component part of the Yangtze River Bridge, which is more than 300 meters long, has been completed. The piers and abutments of the Han River Highway Bridge are neatly lined up on the riverbed, and workers are busy riveting and erecting the bridge. In the line work area on the left bank of the Yangtze River, thousands of workers are cutting mountains, digging soil, and laying roadbeds to rush the line to the bridgehead construction site of the Yangtze River.

At the construction site of the main bridge of the Yangtze River Bridge—on the surging river, stand two groups of large cement hollow pipe columns forming a "pipe column cluster." These pipe columns pass through 30 meters of silt and deep water from the riverbed bedrock, exposing six or seven meters above the water surface; around the water, many red buoys indicate how ships should detour; the adjacent power generation ship is supplying power and lighting for the water construction; in the rapids in front of the former site of the Yellow Crane Tower, a steel "cofferdam" as tall as a four-story building has been preliminarily sunk into the river. During the days of sinking the "cofferdam," it rained, and the river was rising. Small steam boats shuttled back and forth, directing people on the command ship and the riverbank. Two 30-ton large cranes stretching more than 20 meters long necks to the sky and a 75-ton crane arching its back like a frog lifted the cumbersome steel "cofferdam" weighing more than 100 tons. Workers nervously followed the commands and flag signals sent out by the loudspeaker, using winches to tow the large iron barge carrying the "cofferdam," and then slowly lowered the "cofferdam" to the bottom of the river.

The large-scale Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is one of the major projects of our country's socialist construction. The main bridge of the Yangtze River Bridge alone will be 1,700 meters long after completion; below the bridge, there will be sufficient clearance for the largest ships to navigate without obstruction; this is a dual-purpose bridge with double tracks and two layers. The lower layer is paved with double-track railway tracks that can simultaneously accommodate two trains running in opposite directions. The upper-level highway bridge has lanes for six cars to run side by side and wide sidewalks; the bridge towers on both sides are equipped with stairs and elevators, exclusively for pedestrians to go up and down the bridge.

II.

The majestic Yangtze River is more than 5,000 kilometers long, spanning the middle of our country, and its shipping capacity is the highest among the country's rivers. From west to east, it connects the "Land of Abundance"—Sichuan, the "Granary of the Motherland"—the shores of Dongting Lake, and the "Land of Fish and Rice"—the provinces of the South, connecting material exchanges. However, the wide Yangtze River flow simultaneously cut off the traffic between the north and south of the motherland. The south of the river is rich in rice, sugar cane, and world-renowned non-ferrous metal ores, and the north of the river is rich in soybeans, cotton, and ferrous metals. In the process of these materials flowing to each other, they rely only on ferries and wooden boats with very small carrying capacity. When the river is calm and the waves are quiet, transportation is relatively smooth. However, the Yangtze River is known to the world for its dangerous winds and waves.

The verse "Crossing the river is full of storms, a water stretches sorrow for thousands of miles" is a portrayal of the Yangtze River's usual appearance. Whenever thick fog fills the air in winter and winds of force seven blow in summer, "The white waves are like mountains, how can one cross, the mad wind kills the sharp-sailed man." The ferries on the river have to suspend their voyages, so the materials at the ports of the "natural barrier" Yangtze River cannot be quickly transported out.

As early as 1913, a student graduating from the Bridge Department of Peking University, with full enthusiasm, measured the bridge site under the support of the famous engineer Zhan Tianyou and did some design work; afterwards, some engineering personnel conducted three more surveys. However, under the reactionary rule of old China, the young man who made the first measurement had become an old man with white hair, and the Yangtze River Bridge was still just a fantasy. After the national liberation, the Party and the government organized forces to survey and design the Yangtze River Bridge starting from 1950, and started to build the Han River Railway Bridge, one of the components of the bridge, in November 1953, and started to build the Yangtze River Bridge in March this year!

After completion, the Yangtze River Bridge will connect the major railway lines in the north and south of the motherland, the highways of the four provinces in Central China, and other transportation lines, forming a land and water transportation network centered on Wuhan; it will greatly shorten many transportation distances, powerfully support industrial construction, and promote national material exchange. This is the glorious task undertaken by the Yangtze River Bridge in the motherland's construction cause.

III.

Due to the Yangtze River's deep water, rapid flow, wide river surface, and large waves, coupled with the complex geological conditions, there are many difficulties in building bridges on the Yangtze River and building bridge pier foundations in deep water.

Originally, our country decided to adopt the "pneumatic caisson method" when conducting preliminary design. Workers working in high-pressure caissons are prone to various dangerous accidents and easily suffer from a disease medically known as "caisson disease." Caisson work requires very strict physical requirements for people, and even a slight cold is not allowed to enter the caisson for work. Therefore, wherever caissons are used, there are specialized hospitals attached. Although the time for caisson workers to enter and exit the lock underwater is five minutes and fifteen seconds, the actual working time per shift is only forty-five minutes. In this way, how many experienced caisson workers and how much time would the Yangtze River Bridge need to build the bridge foundations! The difficulties are not limited to these. According to the results of geological drilling, it is proved that the rock layer at the bottom of the river is夹有 (contaminated with) sulfide, which will produce toxic gas in the high-pressure caisson, and people cannot work inside.

What method should be used to build the bridge piers? This question knotted in the hearts of many leaders of the Bridge Engineering Bureau. Just then, the Soviet government sent an expert working group headed by Konstantin Sergeevich Silin to the Yangtze River Bridge. These experts had already studied a new construction method that did not use pneumatic caissons when they received the design data of the Yangtze River Bridge in Moscow. After they arrived in China, they studied many construction methods and felt that none of them would work on the Yangtze River. Finally, they also considered that large drilling rigs in the Soviet coal mining industry have made great progress in recent years, and the diameter of many drilling holes has exceeded one meter, and even there are drilling rigs with a drilling hole diameter of 6.5 meters. From many construction methods and new industrial technology achievements, Soviet experts selected an ideal method: sinking a group of hollow cement pipe columns into the riverbed rock, and then using a giant drilling rig to drill holes along the pipe columns to the bottom of the river, and then pouring concrete, so that the bridge piers extend many claws into the rock like an octopus through these pipe columns.

The characteristic of the method of building bridge pier foundations by drilling holes with pipe columns is: it only works on the water, and workers do not have to risk their lives to work at the bottom of the river 40 meters deep, ensuring the health and safety of the workers; the construction is not affected by the rise and fall of the water level, and it is also easy to deal with rock layer karst caves, shortening the construction period and ensuring the progress of the project; the machinery and tools it uses are also much simpler than pneumatic caissons, and it reduces the amount of work, making the bridge pier cost low, which can save about 14 million yuan.

The construction method decided to be adopted by Soviet experts has not been used in the world. This new technical plan has opened up a bright road for us to build the Yangtze River Bridge, advancing the construction period by two seasons, and laying a new technical foundation for our country's bridge construction project.

On February 24 this year, the Yangtze River Bridge construction site began to conduct experiments on the new technology plan. On the rolling river, a 25-ton crawler crane stood on a trestle bridge six or seven meters high, ready to lower a pipe column with a diameter of 1.55 meters, a length of 9 meters, and a weight of more than 9 tons to the bottom of the river. At the beginning, the workers were afraid that the crane and the trestle bridge could not bear such a large weight and did not dare to lift it. At this time, Soviet experts came to give them an account, proving that there would be absolutely no accidents in lifting it, and taught the workers how to prevent the pipe column from swinging in the air. The crane driver mustered up the courage to lift the first section of the pipe column from the ship!

On this day, everyone went to a lot of trouble to erect the first pipe column in the river. In the process of the experiment, Soviet experts always conducted specific guidance on the spot. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the construction site workers and technicians learned while working, and quickly found and mastered the technology of sinking pipe columns, shortening the time for sinking pipe columns from sinking one in the first seven days to sinking one in the fastest 6.7 minutes.

June is the season when the Yangtze River rises. The water level at Wuhan Customs has reached 22 meters. However, the people working on the bridge construction site are still fighting on the river! They have already sunk all the pipe columns of No. 1 and No. 2 piers, and the steel "cofferdam" of No. 8 pier, which is as tall as a four-story building, into the river.

IV.

In order to ensure the progress of the Yangtze River Bridge construction, all parts of the country are providing technical support. More than 30 factories in more than a dozen cities including Shenyang, Shanghai, Beijing, and Wuhan are stepping up the production of various construction machinery and tools for the bridge; many factories in Anshan, Shanhaiguan, Chongqing, and Daye are stepping up the manufacturing of steel rails, steel beams, cement, and various steel materials. The Wuchang Shipyard, which accepted many temporary orders for the bridge, was mobilized to the workers by the party committee secretary himself, and the word "bridge" was stamped on the engineering documents. When the workers received this kind of engineering document with the "bridge" stamp, they postponed other work and first rushed to produce the bridge's orders. The steel rails used for the bridge's turnout line were ordered from Chongqing 101 Steel Plant. The contract was signed very late, and the project urgently needed them. 101 Steel Plant first produced this batch of orders and delivered them in advance to cooperate with the construction of the turnout line. The bridge needed generators, and Shanghai Jiaotong Electrical Equipment Company extracted five units from orders from units that were not in urgent need, so that the construction site could form a power generation ship in time to supply power for water construction.

A large number of technical talents have also been sent from all over the country. This year, the Ministry of Railways has also transferred hundreds of technicians from the Baocheng Line, the Lanxin Line, the Jier Line, and many railway bureaus; the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee has transferred all the technicians from two machine factories and one welding factory to support the bridge construction. The Railway Corps also transferred a technical company, and among these people transferred are divers, loaders, riveters, welders, etc. Among the more than 50 employees of the Wuhan Ferry Company who were sent to the bridge construction site, there are captains, drivers, stokers, and sailors.

The employees of the Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau have improved their skills and expanded their technical team through more than a year of training in the construction of the Han River Railway Bridge and Highway Bridge. With the support of the people of the whole country and the help of the Soviet Union, they will use the world's latest bridge construction technology to strive to complete the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge ahead of schedule.

    新中国的伟大工程——长江大桥
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    一
    中国人民渴望已久的武汉长江大桥工程，现在开始动工了！作为长江大桥组成部分的三百多公尺长的汉水铁桥已经完成，汉水公路桥的桥墩、桥台已经整齐地排立在河道上，工人们正忙着拼铆和架设桥梁。在长江左岸的线路工区里，成千的工人正在削山挖土，铺筑路基，把线路抢修到长江的桥头工地去。
    在长江大桥正桥的工地——浪涛滚滚的江上，屹立两组大型水泥空心管柱组成的“管柱群”。这些管柱由江底岩盘穿过三十公尺的泥沙和深水，露出水面六七公尺；周围的水上，许多红色的浮标指示航船如何绕道而行；旁边的发电船正供给水上施工的动力用电和照明用电；在黄鹤楼遗址前的激流里，跟四层楼房一样高大的钢“围领”已初步沉到江中。在下沉“围领”的日子里，天下雨，江水在上涨，小汽划穿梭般地往来不停，指挥船上和江岸上的人们；两艘向天空伸出二十多公尺长颈的三十吨大吊船和一艘青蛙似的弓着背的七十五吨起重船，将一百多吨重的笨重的钢“围领”吊起来了，工人们紧张地遵照扩音器送出的命令和旗号指挥，用绞索拖出浮运“围领”的大铁驳，然后一点一点地将“围领”沉向江底。
    规模宏大的武汉长江大桥，是我国社会主义建设的重大工程之一。单是建成后的长江大桥的正桥有一千七百公尺长；桥下，有足够的净空，最大的轮船可在桥下航行无阻；这是一座双轨双层的两用桥，下层铺着可同时对开两列火车的双轨铁路，上层的公路桥上有可以并行六辆汽车的汽车道和宽阔的人行道；两岸的桥头堡里装有楼梯、电梯，专供行人上下桥用。
    二
    雄伟的长江全长五千多公里，横亘我国中部，航运的能力为全国江河之冠。它从西到东，把“天府之国”——四川、“祖国粮仓”——洞庭湖滨、
  “鱼米之乡”——江南各省连结起来，勾通物资交流。但是，宽阔的长江的流水同时隔断了祖国南北之间的交通。大江以南盛产稻米、甘蔗和世界驰名的各种有色金属矿石，大江以北盛产大豆、棉花和黑色金属，在这些物资对流过程中，仅赖于运力很小的轮渡和木船转载，当大江中风平浪静的时候，运输比较顺利。然而长江是以险风恶浪著称于世的。
  “横江一渡风波恶，一水牵愁万里长”的诗句，是长江平日面貌的写照。每当冬天浓雾迷漫和夏天刮起七级风的时候，“白浪如山那可渡，狂风愁杀峭帆人”，江上的轮渡便要停航，这样，“天险”长江各口岸的物资，就无法迅速输送出去。
    远在一九一三年，北京大学桥梁系毕业的学生怀着满腔热情，曾在著名的工程师詹天佑支持下，测量过桥址，作过一部分设计；之后，有些工程人员又作过三次勘测。但是，在旧中国的反动统治下，作第一次测量的青年已经成了白发老人，而长江大桥依然只是一个幻想而已。全国解放后，党和政府从一九五○年起，就组织力量勘测和设计长江大桥，并且从一九五三年十一月开始修建大桥组成部分之一的汉水铁桥，今年三月又开始修建长江大桥了！
    建成后的长江大桥，将把祖国南北的各铁路干线、华中四省的公路等交通线路连结起来，以武汉为中心织成水陆交通网；它将使许多运输距离大大地缩短，有力支援工业建设，促进全国物资交流。这是长江大桥在祖国建设事业中所负担的光荣任务。
    三
    由于长江水深、流急、江面宽、风浪大，加之地质情况复杂，要在长江上建设桥梁、在深水中建造桥墩基础，是有很多困难的。
    原来，我国进行初步设计时，决定采用“压气沉箱法”。工人们在高气压的沉箱里工作，很容易发生各种危险的事故，很容易得一种医学上称为
  “沉箱病”的病。沉箱工作对人们的体格要求非常严格，哪怕只有一点轻微的感冒，也不准进沉箱工作。因此，凡是用沉箱的地方，都附设有专门医院。沉箱工作人员在水底下工作，每次进闸和出闸的时间虽有五点十五分钟，但每班实际工作时间只有四十五分钟。这样，长江大桥该需要多少有经验的沉箱工人和多长的时间来建设桥基呢！困难还不止这些。根据地质钻探的结果，证明江底的岩层夹有硫化物，在高气压的沉箱内会发生有毒的气体，人不能在里面工作。
    用什么办法建设桥墩呢？这个问题在大桥工程局许多领导人员的心上结下了疙瘩。就在这时，苏联政府派遣以康斯坦丁·谢尔盖维奇·西林为首的专家工作组来到长江大桥。这些专家还在莫斯科接到我国长江大桥设计资料的时候，就研究出一种不用压气沉箱的新的施工方法。他们到中国以后，研究过许多施工方法，都觉得在长江上行不通。最后，他们又考虑到苏联采煤工业上大型钻机近来已有很大发展，许多钻机钻孔的直径已超过一公尺，甚至有钻孔直径六点五公尺的钻机。从许多施工方法和新的工业技术成就中，苏联专家选出了一种理想的办法：将一组空心水泥管柱沉入江底岩盘上，再用巨型钻机沿着管柱向江底钻孔，然后浇灌混凝土，使桥墩通过这些管柱像乌贼似地伸出许多爪子插进岩层里去。
    用管柱钻孔法建造桥墩基础的特点是：它只在水上施工，工人不必冒生命的危险到四十公尺深的江底工作，保证了工人的健康和安全；施工不受水位升降影响，同时容易处理岩层溶洞，使施工期缩短，保证了工程进度；它用的机具也比压气沉箱简单得多，而且使工程量减少，使桥墩造价低廉，约可节省一千四百万元。
    苏联专家决定采用的这个施工方法，是世界上还没有采用过的，这个新的技术方案，为我们建设长江大桥开辟了光明大道，把施工期提前了两个季节，而且奠定我国建桥工程新的技术基础。
    今年二月二十四日，长江大桥工地开始进行新技术方案的试验。在滚滚的江水上面，二十五吨的爬行吊车站在六七公尺高的栈桥上，准备把直径一点五五公尺、长九公尺、重九吨多的管柱下到江底去。开始，工人们怕吊车和栈桥吃不住这么大的重量，不敢吊。这时苏联专家来给他们算了一笔账，证明吊起来绝对不会出事故，并且教给工人们防止管柱在空中摆动的方法。吊车司机鼓着勇气将第一节管柱从船上吊起了！
    这一天，大家费了多少周折，才将第一根管柱竖立在江中了。在试验过程中，苏联专家总是在现场进行具体指导。在苏联专家指导下，工地工人、技术人员边作边学，很快就找到和掌握了下沉管柱的技术，使管柱下沉时间由最初七天下沉一根缩短到最快六点七分钟下沉一根。
    六月，正是长江涨水的季节。武汉关的水位已到了二十二公尺。但是，在大桥的工地上工作的人们依然战斗在江上！他们已经把一号、二号桥墩的全部管柱，把八号桥墩的跟四层楼房一样高大的钢“围领”，下沉到江中去了。
    四
    为了保证长江大桥建设的进度，全国各地都在技术上加以支援。沈阳、上海、北京、武汉等十几个城市三十多个工厂正加紧赶制大桥各种施工机具；鞍山、山海关、重庆和大冶等地许多工厂加紧制造钢轨、钢梁、水泥和各种钢料。接受了大桥许多临时订货的武昌造船厂，由党委书记亲自向职工动员，并且在工程单上加盖“桥”字的图章。工人们接到这种加盖“桥”字图章的工程单，便把其他活往后排，首先赶制大桥的订货。建筑大桥岔线用的钢轨，是向重庆一○一钢铁厂订的货，合同订得很晚，而工程需用很急。一○一钢铁厂便首先生产这批订货，提前送来，配合上了岔线的建设。大桥需要发电机，上海交通电工器材公司从不急用的单位的订货中抽出五台，使工地及时组成了发电船，供水上施工用电。
    全国各地还派来了大批技术人才。今年，铁道部又从宝成线、兰新线、集二线和许多铁路管理局调来了上百的技工；武汉市人民委员会将两个机器厂和一个电焊厂的技工全部调出支援大桥建设，铁道兵也调来了一个技术连，调来的这些人中有潜水员、装吊工、铆工、焊工等。武汉市轮渡公司输送到大桥工地的五十多名职工中，有船长、驾驶、司炉、水手。
    长江大桥工程局的职工，经过一年多来建设汉水铁桥和公路桥的锻炼，已经提高了技术，壮大了技术队伍。他们在全国人民支援下，在苏联帮助下，用全世界最新的建桥技术，要争取提前建成武汉长江大桥。
