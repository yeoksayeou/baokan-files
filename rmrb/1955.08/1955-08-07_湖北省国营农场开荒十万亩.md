    Hubei State-Run Farms Reclaim 100,000 Mu of Wasteland
    The Hubei State-Run "53" Mechanical Farm and several other relatively large state-run farms have reclaimed nearly 100,000 mu of wasteland in the first half of this year. By the end of this year, these farms will have reclaimed 700,000 mu of wasteland. Most of the reclaimed land has been planted with rice, cotton, and coarse grains. Currently, the various crops are growing well, and it is estimated that they can increase the nation's grain production by 120 million jin and cotton production by more than 2.8 million jin.
    In the Jianghan Plain area of Hubei Province, during the reactionary ruling era, due to the long-term disrepair of river embankments and people's levees, breaches occurred frequently, leading to chaotic internal water systems and the abandonment of large tracts of land. It is estimated that there are more than 4 million mu of wasteland suitable for mechanized farming. Since liberation, while the People's Government has been repairing water conservancy facilities in these areas year by year, it has also begun to build state-run farms to carry out large-scale land reclamation. This year, with the progress of the Yangtze River flood storage and reclamation work, Hubei Province is also preparing to build three state-run mechanical farms in the Longgan Lake area of Huangmei County and the Zongkou area of Qianjiang County. Surveying work has been completed, and the area to be reclaimed has been determined to be 170,000 mu. (Yuan Jun)

    湖北省国营农场开荒十万亩
    湖北省国营五三机械农场和几个比较大的国营农场，今年上半年开垦了将近十万亩荒地，到今年年底，这些农场开垦的荒地将要达到七十万亩。已经开垦的荒地上，大部都种了水稻、棉花和杂粮，目前各种作物都生长良好，预计可为国家增产粮食一亿二千万斤，皮棉二百八十多万斤。
    湖北省沿江滨湖地区，在反动统治年代里，因为江堤民垸长年失修，溃决频繁，以致内部水系混乱，荒废了大片土地，据估计，适于机耕的荒地约有四百万亩以上。解放以后，人民政府在这些地区逐年整修水利的同时，开始兴建国营农场，进行大规模的垦荒工作。今年，随着长江蓄洪垦殖工作的进展，湖北省又在黄梅县龙感湖地区和潜江县总口地区筹建三个国营机械农场，勘测工作已经完成，确定垦荒面积十七万亩。　（袁军）
