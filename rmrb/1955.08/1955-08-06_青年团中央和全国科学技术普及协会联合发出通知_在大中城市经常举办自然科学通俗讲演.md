The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization jointly issued a notice on carrying out popular science lectures with a plan and on a regular basis in major and medium-sized cities.

The notice stated that the purpose of carrying out this lecture work is to enable the vast number of young people to correctly understand natural phenomena and their regularity, improve the scientific knowledge level of young people, eliminate feudal superstition, and thereby establish a dialectical materialist worldview. The main target of this lecture is young workers, and street youth and office youth with lower cultural levels should be appropriately absorbed to participate. According to current conditions, science lectures should first be held universally in large and medium-sized cities with science and technology popularization associations; science lectures should also be held in those places where there are no science and technology popularization associations but lecturers can still be found.

The notice stated that in order to educate more young people, local areas can organize lecturers to conduct lectures in districts and go deep into larger factories and mining enterprises, or invite technicians with a high school education or above in factories and mines to serve as lecturers, and at the same time, they can also use other different forms to organize young people to listen to lectures, according to different situations.

The notice requires that local Communist Youth League committees and science and technology popularization associations should closely cooperate and conduct regular investigations and research, and jointly formulate lecture plans and study lecture content, in addition to appropriate division of labor.

The notice finally pointed out that when carrying out this work, local areas should fully publicize the importance of this study, adhere to the principle of voluntariness, and oppose any coercive orders or rigid regulations. The content of the lectures should be as popular and simple as possible, concise and to the point, and proceed from the actual situation and requirements of the youth, introduce more basic scientific knowledge, and pay attention to the use of figurative propaganda tools.

    青年团中央和全国科学技术普及协会联合发出通知
    在大中城市经常举办自然科学通俗讲演
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会和中华全国科学技术普及协会联合发出关于在各大、中城市有计划地经常开展自然科学常识的通俗讲演工作的通知。
    通知中说，开展这一讲演工作的目的是要使广大青年能够正确地认识自然现象及其规律性，提高青年的科学知识水平，破除封建迷信思想，从而树立辩证唯物主义世界观。这一讲演的主要对象是青年职工，适当吸收街道青年和文化水平较低的机关青年参加。根据目前条件，首先要求在设有科学技术普及协会的大、中城市普遍举行科学讲座；在那些虽无科学技术普及协会但仍可找到讲演员的地方，也应举办科学讲演。
    通知中说，为了使更多的青年受到教育，各地可根据不同情况，组织讲演员分区和深入较大的厂矿企业单位进行讲演，或邀请厂矿中具有高中以上文化程度的技术人员担任讲演员，同时还可利用其他不同形式组织青年听讲。
    通知中要求各地团委和科学技术普及协会除了适当的分工外，要密切合作，经常进行调查研究，共同拟定讲演计划和研究讲演内容。
    通知中最后指出，各地在进行这项工作时，应充分宣传这项学习的重要意义，坚持自愿原则，反对采取任何强迫命令或硬性规定的办法。讲演内容应力求通俗浅显、简明扼要，并从青年的实际情况和要求出发，多介绍基本的科学知识，注意运用形象化的宣传工具。（新华社）
