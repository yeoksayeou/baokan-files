　　Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, August 24th: The economic and technical assistance of the Soviet Union plays a decisive role in the construction of the Anshan Iron and Steel Complex.

　　Two-thirds of the design of all capital construction projects of Anshan Iron and Steel was done with the help of the Soviet Union. Starting in 1950, thousands of outstanding design experts in the Soviet Union's Ferrous Metallurgy Design Institute used the latest Soviet technological achievements to make preliminary designs for many new and rebuilt major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel. Two-thirds of the technical design and more than half of the construction design of these major projects were also done with the help of the Soviet Union. In order to cultivate China's ferrous metallurgy design technical force, the Soviet government, in addition to sending a group of outstanding ferrous metallurgy design experts to Anshan to help with the work, also provided China with a large amount of ferrous metallurgy design technical data accumulated over the past 30 years. With the help of the Soviet government and experts, Anshan's ferrous metallurgy design technical force has grown rapidly. The workload they completed in six months in 1954 was equal to the workload of the entire year of 1953, and the workload completed in the first half of this year exceeded the workload completed in the entire year of last year. In the past two years, Soviet experts have also put forward nearly 10,000 suggestions in engineering design. The second, third, and fourth automated blast furnaces that have been successfully rebuilt can produce a lot more pig iron each year because the hearth was enlarged based on the suggestions of Soviet experts.

　　Almost every major construction project of Anshan Iron and Steel has the latest equipment supplied by the Soviet Union. The main complete sets of equipment for the large rolling mill, seamless steel tube mill, second sheet mill that have been built and some important projects that are under construction are mostly manufactured by the Soviet Union for China. Most of the main equipment for some mines, ore dressing, ironmaking, steelmaking, and coking projects that have been built and are under construction also come from the Soviet Union. The Soviet government is also very concerned about giving full play to the manufacturing capacity of China's machinery manufacturing industry. Over the past few years, the Soviet Union has carefully reviewed the equipment orders submitted by Anshan Iron and Steel, and if they found that China could manufacture it themselves, they would provide the equipment manufacturing drawings and let China trial-produce it themselves. Therefore, the fifth automated blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel, which will be completed next year, and the coking furnace, which will start construction next year, will have all kinds of equipment required, except for instruments, manufactured in domestic machinery factories. Most of the equipment required for mining and ore dressing projects to be built by Anshan Iron and Steel in the future can also be supplied domestically.

　　In capital construction, many outstanding experts sent by the Soviet government not only provided technical guidance, ensuring the completion of 17 major projects such as large rolling mills and seamless steel tube mills, but also put forward more than 16,000 suggestions covering enterprise management, construction technology, and safety technology. With the help of Soviet experts, the workers building Anshan Iron and Steel have formed more than a dozen construction and installation engineering companies for steelmaking, rolling steel, blast furnaces, mines, machinery, electrical, industrial furnace construction, and pipelines, and have learned the ability to carry out large-scale construction in an orderly manner in a vast and complex operating environment. After implementing a series of winter construction technical measures proposed by Soviet experts, the people who built Anshan Iron and Steel broke the old rule that Anshan could not be constructed in winter, and could still carry out a lot of construction as usual during the four months of the cold winter season. In the winter of 1954, the amount of capital construction they completed accounted for 44.7 percent of the actual amount completed for the whole year, greatly speeding up the construction. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, each construction worker has an average of 2.7 horsepower of construction machinery to help with the work, and the level of mechanization and industrialized construction has reached more than 50 to 95 percent in several major aspects such as earthwork, concrete, metal structure engineering, and transportation, which can speed up the project progress by an average of 30 percent, and also guarantee the quality of the project, and the labor intensity of the workers is also getting lighter and lighter.

### 苏联的援助对建设鞍钢起着决定性的作用

　　苏联的援助对建设鞍钢起着决定性的作用
    新华社鞍山二十四日电　苏联的经济和技术援助，对于鞍山钢铁联合企业的建设起着决定性的作用。
    鞍钢全部基本建设工程的设计，有三分之二是苏联帮助我国做的。从一九五零年开始，在苏联的黑色冶金设计院里，就有数以千计的优秀设计专家，以苏联的最新技术成就为鞍钢的很多新建和改建的主要工程进行初步设计。这些主要工程的三分之二的技术设计和半数以上的施工设计，也是由苏联帮助我国来做。为了培养我国的黑色冶金设计技术力量，苏联政府除派来一批优秀的黑色冶金设计专家到鞍山来帮助工作以外，还把三十年来积累起来的大批黑色冶金设计技术资料供给了我国。在苏联政府和专家帮助下，鞍山的黑色冶金设计技术力量成长得很快。一九五四年他们在六个月内完成的工作量就等于一九五三年全年的工作量，而今年上半年完成的工作量又超过了去年全年完成的工作量。两年多来，苏联专家还在工程设计中提出了近万件建议。已经改建成功的第二、第三、第四座自动化高炉，由于根据苏联专家建议扩大了炉缸，每座高炉每年就可以多生产很多生铁。
    鞍钢的主要建设工程差不多每一项都有着苏联供应的最新式的设备。已建成的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、第二薄板厂和正在建设着的一些重要工程的主要成套设备，多是苏联为我国制造的。已建成的和正在建设中的一些矿山、选矿、炼铁、炼钢、炼焦等工程的大部分主要设备也是来自苏联的。苏联政府还十分关心发挥我国机器制造业的制造能力。几年来鞍钢向苏联提出的设备订货，他们都仔细地作了审查，发现我国自己能制造的就供给设备制造图，让我国自己试制。因此，将在明年建成的鞍钢第五座自动化高炉和在明年动工新建的炼焦炉，除计器以外，所需各种设备都将在国内机械厂制造了。鞍钢今后建设的采矿、选矿工程所需的绝大部分设备也都可以由国内供应。
    在基本建设施工中，苏联政府派来的许多优秀专家，不仅给以技术指导，保证了大型轧钢厂，无缝钢管厂等十七项主要工程的建成，并提出了包括企业管理、施工技术、安全技术等各方面的建议共达一万六千多件。在苏联专家帮助下，建设鞍钢的职工已组成了炼钢、轧钢、高炉、矿山、机械、电气、工业筑炉和管道等十多个建筑、安装工程公司，并且学会了在浩繁复杂的作业环境中有条不紊地进行大规模施工的本领。实行苏联专家提出的一系列冬季施工技术措施以后，建设鞍钢的人们就打破了鞍山冬季不能施工的陈规，在四个月的隆冬季节中也能照常地进行大量施工。一九五四年冬季他们完成的基本建设工作量就占全年实际完成的工作量百分之四十四点七，大大加快了建设速度。在苏联专家指导下，每个建筑工人平均已有二点七匹马力的施工机械帮助工作，机械化、工厂化施工水平在土方、混凝土、金属结构工程及运输等几个主要方面已分别达到百分之五十到百分之九十五以上，平均可以加快工程进度百分之三十，并且保证了工程质量，工人的劳动强度也越来越减轻。
