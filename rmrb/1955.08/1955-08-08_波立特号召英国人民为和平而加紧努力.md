　　Xinhua News Agency, London, 7th. TASS reported from London on the 7th: The General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, Pollitt, published an article in the "Daily Worker," welcoming the results of the Geneva Conference. At the same time, he emphasized that the forces of peace must not relax their efforts. He pointed out that in capitalist countries, there are still powerful forces who hate and fear any relaxation of international tension. The best way to express happiness at the success of the Geneva Conference is to work even harder for peace.

　　Pollitt pointed out: One of the preliminary results of the Geneva Conference—the upcoming visit of Bulganin and Khrushchev to Britain—is of the utmost importance for future British-Soviet relations.

　　Pollitt called on the British people to make Britain support the organization of a European collective security system that will guarantee European countries against aggression; promote the success of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee; use Britain's influence on peace in the Far East to guarantee the People's Republic of China's rights to Taiwan and to ensure that China is admitted to the United Nations; and maximize the development of trade between East and West.

    波立特号召英国人民为和平而加紧努力
    新华社七日讯　据塔斯社伦敦七日讯：英国共产党总书记波立特在“工人日报”上发表文章，欢迎日内瓦会议的结果。他同时也强调说，和平力量必须不放松他们的努力。他指出，在资本主义国家里，仍然有着强大的势力，他们憎恨并且害怕国际紧张局势有任何缓和。对日内瓦会议的成功表示高兴的最好办法就是要更加艰苦地为和平而努力。
    波立特指出：日内瓦会议的初步成果之一——即将来到的布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫到英国的访问，对于将来的英苏关系具有最大的重要性。
    波立特号召英国人民使英国支持组织一个将保证欧洲各国免遭侵略的欧洲集体安全体系；促使联合国裁军小组委员会工作成功；利用英国对远东和平的影响，来保证中华人民共和国对台湾的权利，并且使中国被接纳入联合国；最大限度地发展东西方之间的贸易。
