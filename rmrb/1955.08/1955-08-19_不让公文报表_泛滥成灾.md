Preventing the "Proliferation" of Official Documents and Reports
Gu Hong

Official documents and reports are necessary tools for promoting work, and it is wrong to underestimate their role. With the development of socialist construction, the work of various organs is becoming increasingly complex, and official documents and reports are bound to increase to a certain extent. However, according to the situation revealed in the rectification and reorganization, the official documents and reports of many organs have increased to an alarming extent. Many of these official documents and reports are not only unnecessary for the work, but also bring serious harm to the work.

Taking the central-level organs as an example, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications received and sent more than 294,000 various documents and telegrams in 1954, and the Ministry of Railways issued as many as 263,000 documents. The number of provincial-level organs is also considerable. The provincial-level organs of Liaoning Province issued 150,000 official documents in half a year, weighing 30 tons. The central organs formulate reports, and the local organs increase them level by level. As a result, the reports "proliferate" in grassroots organizations. The Dalian Iron and Steel Plant has to fill out more than 2,000 kinds of reports and original records. According to incomplete statistics from 17 organs at the county level, one district, and two townships in Jimo County, Shandong Province, there are 430 kinds of reports. In this way, grassroots organizations have to spend a lot of time filling out the reports. In addition, the items in the reports are numerous and difficult to fill out, which increases the burden on grassroots workers. The Central South Tax Bureau has a numerical report, which requires more than 1,600 calculations from beginning to end. A questionnaire sent to Datai Township, Tong County, Hebei Province, had so many items that the report paper was three feet long. The township staff called this form a "foot-binding form," and it took them more than a month to fill it out. There are many such examples.

In fact, some official documents and reports can be issued less or even not at all. Some matters could be resolved by talking face to face, but some organs have to issue documents. Of the 217,000 documents and telegrams received and sent by the Ministry of Foreign Trade in 1954, unnecessary copies accounted for 68,000, or 30 percent. The head office of the People's Bank of China issued nearly 2,000 documents per month from January to April this year, of which replies accounted for about 80 percent, and more than half of them could have been omitted. Precisely because many official documents and reports are unnecessary, they are sent back and forth, and no one is responsible. The Basic Construction Finance Section of the Electric Power General Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry received engineering final accounts from more than 2,000 units in the past two years. Because they were not very useful, they are still locked in the cabinet, wasting 9,000 workdays for nothing. No wonder some people say: "We only ask for reports, but we don't look at them. Once the reports arrive, we tie them up and go to sleep."

Not only are there many official documents and reports, but the procedures for handling them are also cumbersome and complicated. At the central level, a general document needs to go through more than a dozen procedures from receipt to dispatch, and some even go through seventy or eighty procedures. Some official documents are kicked around like a football, and the problem is delayed for half a year or even more than a year without being resolved. For example, the Ministry of Forestry received a suggestion from a staff member of the Nanjing Timber Company in Jiangsu Province last February on improving the timber slide rule to save timber. After being pushed back and forth by six units, it took five months to process and then returned the original to Jiangsu. The Ministry of Fuel Industry received a document from the Yunnan Hydropower Engineering Bureau submitting a road construction budget. It was circulated for more than two months, and the road had already been built, but the budget had not been approved.

How is this phenomenon of proliferation of official documents and reports caused? Needless to say, this is caused by the serious bureaucracy and red tape of various organs. Specifically, there are two situations: One situation is that some leaders do not go down to check the implementation of the plan, but sit in the office waiting for the situation to arrive. Therefore, they have to issue a large number of official documents and reports to the lower levels. However, there are too many things sent from below, and they cannot be read, so they have to read only a part or the main part, and some even do not read at all and shelve them. The second time they need the situation, they still reach out to the lower levels. In this way, official documents and reports become more and more numerous. Another situation is that some leaders regard issuing official documents and asking for reports as a "standardized" working method. Therefore, regardless of the size of the matter, whether it is necessary or not, they have to issue documents. In fact, this is a formalistic leadership method, a manifestation of the habits of the old yamen.

Secondly, overlapping institutions and too many levels are also important reasons for the large number of official documents and reports. The more levels of institutions, the more documents and forms are issued. What's more, these overlapping institutions often have unclear divisions of labor, and they push back and forth when dealing with problems, which increases unnecessary correspondence. In the past, the Ministry of Fuel Industry had five levels of institutions from the ministry to the grassroots factories and mines. In 1954, the document on borrowing a water pump from the Fengfeng New Machine Engineering Office by the Xinsi New Machine Engineering Office of the Ministry of Fuel Industry was transferred back and forth in nine places, including three bureaus, two offices, and four factories and mines of the Ministry of Fuel Industry. Twenty-eight documents were exchanged, and the problem was resolved after one year and eight months.

According to the above situation, the main way to change the phenomenon of many official documents and reports after streamlining the institutions is to overcome bureaucracy and red tape. Leaders should not just sit in the office and review documents, but should go deep into the front line to guide the work. This can not only greatly reduce official documents and reports, but also enable the official documents issued by the leaders after going deep into reality to be in line with the actual situation and achieve greater results. On the other hand, leaders should personally control the tool of reports, and not allow staff to distribute them casually. It is necessary to issue what should be issued, and not to issue what should not be issued. Never bring countless troubles to lower-level organs for your own convenience and affect their work.

Through the rectification and reorganization work, some organs have made preliminary achievements in overcoming bureaucracy. The Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and others have checked the problems existing in the handling of official documents in the past, and held exhibitions of bureaucracy, so that staff members further realized the harm of bureaucracy and red tape. The Ministry of Light Industry clearly stipulated the scope of wholesale official documents and the internal and external liaison system, and now the correspondence has been reduced. Before the reorganization, the ministry issued an average of 40 to 60 documents per day, but now it issues an average of only 16 documents per day. The telegrams sent by the Ministry of Foreign Trade have also decreased by nearly 40% compared with the first quarter. The Second Ministry of Machine Building reduced the current statistical reports by more than 57%. Some organs have reduced the review procedures and stipulated that important official documents should be drafted by leading staff members themselves; some organs have also stipulated strict approval procedures for the formulation and issuance of reports. However, it should be pointed out that there are still many organs that have not yet started to improve the work of official documents and reports because the leaders do not pay attention to it, and some have done some, but it is not very in-depth. This should be corrected immediately.

    不让公文报表“泛滥成灾”
    谷洪
    公文和报表是推动工作必要的工具，轻视公文和报表的作用是不对的。随着社会主义建设事业的发展，各机关的业务愈来愈繁复，公文和报表也必然有一定的增加。但是根据整编中所揭发的情况来看，许多机关的公文报表已多到惊人的程度，其中有许多公文报表不但不是工作所必要的，而且给工作带来严重的危害。
    以中央一级机关来说，邮电部一九五四年收发各种文电达二十九万四千多件，铁道部仅发文即达二十六万三千多件。省级机关也不少，辽宁省一级机关半年内发下去的公文有十五万件，重达三十吨。中央机关制发了报表，地方机关还要逐级增加，结果，报表在基层组织中就“泛滥成灾”。大连钢铁厂要填两千多种报表和原始记录，据山东省即墨县的县一级十七个机关、一个区和两个乡的不完全统计，共有报表四百三十种。这样，基层组织不得不用很多的时间来填写报表。加上报表的项目繁多，难填，给基层工作人员增加了更多的负担。中南税务局有个数字报表，从头到尾计算一次，需要打一千六百多次算盘。发到河北省通县大台乡的一个调查表项目繁多，报表纸长达三尺，乡工作人员叫这表是“裹脚表”，忙了一个多月还没有填写完。这样的例子是不少的。
    事实上，有些公文和报表是可以少发甚至不发的。本来当面谈谈就可以解决的事情，但有些机关却要行文。对外贸易部一九五四年收发的二十一万七千多件文电中，不必要的抄件即有六万八千多件，占百分之三十。中国人民银行总行今年一至四月份平均每月发文将近两千件，其中批复约占百分之八十，而其中有一半以上是可以不复的。正因为许多公文报表是不必要的，因此送来送去，没人负责。燃料工业部电业总局的基本建设财务科，前两年报来的二千多个单位的工程决算表，因用处不大，到现在还锁在柜里，白白浪费了九千个工作日。难怪有人说：“只要报表，不看报表，报表一到，捆起睡觉。”
    不仅公文报表多，而且处理公文报表的手续也繁琐、复杂。中央一级机关一般公文从收进到发出需要经过十几道手续，有的甚至要经过七八十道。有些公文踢皮球似地踢来踢去，问题拖延半年甚至一年以上不得解决。如林业部去年二月收到江苏省南京市木材公司一个工作人员关于改进木材计算尺节约木材的建议，经过六个单位推来推去，拖延了五个月的时间不能处理，又将原件退回江苏去了。燃料工业部收到云南水电工程局报送修公路预算一文，传了两个多月，公路已经修好，但是预算还没有批回。
    这种公文报表泛滥的现象是怎样造成的呢？不用说，这是由各机关严重的文牍主义官僚主义作风所造成的。具体情况有两种：一种情况是，某些领导人员不深入下去检查计划执行情况，而是在办公室中坐等情况到来，因此不得不大量地向下边发公文报表，但下面送来的东西太多，看不了，于是只得看一部分或看主要部分，有的甚至根本不看，束之高阁。第二次需要情况时，还照样伸手向下面要。就这样，公文报表愈来愈多。另一种情况则是，某些领导人员把发公文、要报表当做“正规化”的工作方法，因此不管事情大小，有无必要，都要行文发表。实际上这是形式主义的领导方法，是旧衙门的习气的表现。
    其次，机构重叠，层次过多，也是造成公文报表多的重要原因。机构层次多，发文造表也就多，何况这些重叠机构往往分工不清，在处理问题时推来推去，更增多了不必要的文电来往。过去燃料工业部自部到基层厂矿共有五级机构，一九五四年下摄司新机工程处借调峰峰新机工程处给水泵的问题的公文，先后在燃料工业部三个局、二个处、四个厂矿等九个地方转来转去，来往公文二十八件，问题拖了一年八个月才得解决。
    根据上面的情况看来，在精简机构后，改变公文报表多的现象的主要办法就是克服文牍主义和官僚主义。领导人员不要只是坐在办公室中批阅公文，还应当深入现场，指导工作。这样不但能够大大减少公文报表，而且领导深入实际后，所必要发下去的公文也能切合实际情况，收到更大的效果。另一方面，领导人员要亲自掌握报表这一工具，不能听任工作人员随便散发。要做到该发的发，不该发的一定不发，决不要为了自己方便，而给下级机关带来无数麻烦，影响他们的工作。
    通过整编工作，有些机关在克服文牍主义方面，已经有了初步成绩。燃料工业部、对外贸易部等检查了过去公文处理中存在的问题，举行了文牍主义的展览会，使工作人员进一步认识到文牍主义、官僚主义的危害性。轻工业部明确规定了批发公文的范围和内外联系制度，现在来往公文就减少了。该部整编前平均每天发文四十至六十件，现在每天平均只发十六件。对外贸易部发出的电报，也较第一季度减少了将近百分之四十。第二机械工业部把现行统计报表减去了百分之五十七以上。有些机关减少了核稿手续，规定重要公文由领导工作人员亲自拟稿；有些机关还规定了制发报表的严格批准手续。但应该指出，还有许多机关，由于领导人员不重视，还没有着手改进公文报表工作，有的虽然作了一些，但很不深入。这是应该立即纠正的。
