    Conducting a Census of Private Commerce and the Catering Industry
    The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is an important component of the general task of the state during the transition period, and it is also one of the basic tasks of our country's first Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy. The basic tasks of the Five-Year Plan stipulate that within five years, "capitalist industry and commerce should be basically incorporated into various forms of state capitalism, and the foundation for the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce should be established." To achieve this historical task, a lot of work needs to be done, and the first thing is to have some understanding of the basic situation of private industry and commerce throughout the country, so as to arrange and transform them in a planned and step-by-step manner according to the specific situation. In order to thoroughly understand the situation of private commerce and the catering industry, the State Council has decided to conduct a census of private commerce and the catering industry in September and October this year. This is absolutely necessary.
    In 1954, a survey of capitalist industrial enterprises was conducted nationwide. Through this survey, the state grasped the basic situation of capitalist industrial enterprises, which greatly facilitated the work of arranging and transforming private industry in a planned and step-by-step manner under the principle of "overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement." As for private commerce, although various regions and departments have also done a lot of survey work and grasped some data in recent years, generally speaking, we still do not have a full understanding of the basic situation of private commerce; the various figures already available in various departments are also extremely inconsistent, incomplete, and inaccurate. Therefore, it has not yet been thoroughly investigated how many households, how many employees, and how much capital there are in private commerce nationwide. The situation of the private catering industry is even less understood. Obviously, this situation cannot continue and we must actively find ways to conduct a more thorough understanding.
    The "National Private Commerce and Catering Industry Census Plan" formulated by the State Statistical Bureau and other departments has made specific provisions on the content, time, methods, and steps of the census; but in the process of implementation, all regions must also pay attention to grasping two principles. The first is that the census indicators must be simple and clear, and not require too much. The five indicators stipulated in the census plan are appropriate and should not be increased. The second is to recognize that the census of private enterprises is very different from the census of state-owned enterprises, and that a comprehensive census is also extremely different from a general key survey and sample survey. A census can only solve a few major problems in the work, and cannot be required to solve many problems. If we do not pay attention to these two principles, and the indicators and problems to be solved by the census are too many, it will prolong the time of the census work and increase some unnecessary difficulties in the work.
    In order to do a good job in this census, all regions must do a good job of a series of ideological and organizational work. Because the task of the private commerce and catering industry census is quite arduous and complex, it involves the state's policy towards the bourgeoisie, and its objects include commercial capitalists and millions of small vendors across the country. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen ideological leadership, do a good job in propaganda and education, eliminate various ideological concerns that may arise in all aspects, overcome obstacles, and mobilize the vast number of private commercial employees to actively participate in this work. Facts have proved that it is by no means an easy task to get capitalists to truthfully report their business situation without any struggle. Therefore, in addition to explaining to the capitalists the state's policy of arranging and transforming capitalist industry and commerce and the purpose and significance of this census, and educating them to honestly report their business situation, it is also necessary to fully rely on and mobilize the vast number of shop assistants and employees to actively help the government do a good job in this census and strictly supervise the capitalists to fill in the forms truthfully. This is an important guarantee for doing a good job in the census. As for the vast number of small vendors, it is also necessary to enlighten their class consciousness from all aspects and educate them to report truthfully.
    This census of private commerce and the catering industry is very large in scale. The cadres participating in this work across the country come from various work departments, their political and professional levels are also different, and they generally lack census work experience. Therefore, before the census work begins, all regions must conscientiously do a good job in cadre training, and strive to ensure that every cadre participating in this census can deeply understand the state's policies and guidelines for arranging and transforming private commerce and the catering industry, understand the purpose, tasks and important significance of this census, correct their work attitude, understand the content of the census plan, the meaning of various forms and indicators and various specific regulations, and apply them specifically in practical work.
    Of course, in the process of actually carrying out the census work, many new problems will definitely arise. Therefore, after the census work begins, all regions must also organize a group of stronger cadres to go deep into the grassroots units to conduct inspection and guidance work, discover problems in a timely manner, and help solve them on the spot. The leading departments of census work at all levels must directly grasp a few key units, summarize good experiences in the work in a timely manner, and quickly promote them.
    Conscientiously doing a good job in the review and collection of census data is the key to the success or failure of the census work. The "National Private Commerce and Catering Industry Census Plan" stipulates that census data can be provided by the following methods: issuing census forms for business owners to fill in and submit for review according to regulations; sending investigators to visit and register households one by one; for small vendors, information can also be obtained by holding investigation meetings through relevant organizations, or selecting several typical ones among small vendors in each industry to conduct investigations and estimate the overall figures accordingly (but the total number of households and people must still be investigated clearly). No matter which method is adopted, the purpose is to obtain accurate and reliable data on the basic situation of private commerce and the catering industry. Therefore, personnel participating in the census work in all regions, especially in counties and cities, must conscientiously strengthen the review of the original census data. If errors are found or there are doubts, they should be checked and corrected or supplemented on the spot, so as to ensure that they are true and accurate.
    The collection of census data is the last important procedure in the entire census work. If this work is not done well, even if the original data is correct, it will not be possible to obtain true and reliable comprehensive data. Although the indicators of the grassroots census form are relatively simple this time, the amount of work involved in collecting them is very large and the grouping is more complicated. Therefore, all regions must strengthen the ideological education of cadres, strictly prevent a careless work style, and help them learn the methods of sorting out and collecting data to ensure that no errors occur.
    The census work will begin soon, and all regions must immediately start preparing for various tasks so that the census work can proceed smoothly.

### 对私营商业和饮食业进行普查

    对私营商业和饮食业进行普查
    对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造，是过渡时期国家总任务的一个重要组成部分，也是我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的基本任务之一。五年计划的基本任务中规定：五年内要“基本上把资本主义工商业分别地纳入各种形式的国家资本主义的轨道，建立对于私营工商业的社会主义改造的基础”。要实现这一历史任务，需要进行很多工作，而首先必须对全国的私营工商业的基本情况有所了解，以便根据具体情况，有计划有步骤地对它们进行安排和改造。为了比较彻底地了解私营商业和饮食业的情况，国务院决定在今年九、十月间进行一次私营商业和饮食业的普查工作。这是完全必要的。
    一九五四年在全国范围内对资本主义工业企业曾进行了一次调查，经过这次调查，国家掌握了资本主义工业企业的基本情况，大大便利了在“统筹兼顾，全面安排”的方针下对私营工业进行有计划有步骤的安排和改造的工作。至于私营商业方面，几年来各地区、各部门虽也做了不少的调查工作，掌握了一部分资料，但总的说来，我们对私营商业的基本情况仍没有充分了解；各部门已有的各种数字，也极不统一、不全面、不准确，因而全国私营商业究竟有多少户数，多少从业人员，多少资金，都还没有彻底调查清楚。私营饮食业的情况，则了解得更差。显然，这种状况是不能继续下去的，必须积极设法进行比较彻底的了解。
    国家统计局等部门制定的“全国私营商业和饮食业普查方案”，对普查的内容、时间、方法和步骤都作了具体的规定；但在执行过程中，各地还必须注意掌握两个原则。首先就是普查的指标必须简单、明确，不能要求过多，普查方案中所规定的五个指标是适宜的，不应当再增加。其次就是要认清对私营企业的普查和对国营企业的普查有很大不同，全面的普查和一般的重点调查、抽样调查也有极大的区别，一次普查只能解决工作中的几个主要问题，而不能要求解决很多问题。如果不注意这两项原则，普查的指标和要求解决的问题太多，就会拖长普查工作的时间，增加工作中的一些不应有的困难。
    为了作好这次普查工作，各地必须作好一系列的思想工作和组织工作。由于私营商业和饮食业普查工作的任务相当艰巨复杂，它牵连到国家对资产阶级的政策，它的对象包括全国商业资本家和几百万小商小贩，因之必须加强思想领导，做好宣传教育工作，消除各方面可能发生的各种思想顾虑，克服障碍，并发动广大私营商业的从业人员积极参加这项工作。事实证明，要叫资本家将他们的营业情况据实报告清楚，绝不是一件容易的不经过任何斗争就能办到的事情，因此，除了向资本家讲清楚国家对资本主义工商业安排改造的政策和这次普查的目的和意义，教育他们要老实报告营业情况以外，还必须充分依靠和发动广大店员职工，积极帮助政府做好这次普查工作，严格监督资本家据实填报，这是作好普查工作的一个重要保证。至于对广大的小商小贩，也要从各方面去启发他们的阶级觉悟，教育他们据实报告。
    这次对私营商业和饮食业进行的普查工作，就其规模来讲是很大的。全国参加这一工作的干部，来自各个不同的工作部门，他们的政治、业务水平也不相同，而且一般是缺乏普查工作经验的。因此，各地在普查工作开始以前，必须认真做好干部训练工作，务求做到每一个参加这次普查工作的干部，都能深刻认识国家对私营商业和饮食业安排改造的政策方针，了解这次普查的目的、任务和重要意义，端正自己的工作态度，懂得普查方案的内容，各个表式、指标的涵义及各项具体规定，并在实际工作中加以具体应用。
    当然，在实际进行普查工作的过程中，一定还会发生许多新的问题。因此，各地区在普查工作开始以后，还必须组织一批较强的干部，深入到基层单位进行检查辅导工作，及时发现问题，就地帮助解决。各级普查工作的领导部门，必须直接掌握几个重点单位，及时总结工作中好的经验，迅速加以推广。
    切实做好普查资料的审核和汇集工作，是普查工作成绩好坏的关键。“全国私营商业和饮食业普查方案”中规定，普查资料可由以下方法提供：颁发普查表由业户按规定自行填报送审；派调查人员逐户访问登记；对小商小贩亦可采取通过有关组织开调查会的方法取得资料，或在每一同业的小商贩中选择若干典型进行调查，据以估计推算全面数字（但全业户数、人数仍须调查清楚）。不论采取那种方法，其目的都在于取得正确可靠的私营商业和饮食业基本情况的资料，因此，各地区特别是各县、市参加普查工作的人员，必须认真加强对普查的原始资料的审核工作，如果发现错误或有疑问，应就地查对更正或补充，务必做到真实无误。
    普查资料的汇集，是整个普查工作的最后一道重要的程序。如果这一工作做不好，即使原始资料是正确的，也得不出真实可靠的全面资料来。这次的普查工作，虽然基层普查表的指标比较简单，但汇集起来的工作量很大，分组也较复杂。因此，各地区必须加强对干部的思想教育，严防粗枝大叶的作风；帮助他们学会整理和汇集资料的方法，保证不发生错误。
    普查工作很快就要开始了，各地必须立即着手做好各项准备工作，使普查工作能够顺利进行。
