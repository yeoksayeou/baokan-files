Editorial:

    The International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy opens in Geneva today. This conference was convened in accordance with the resolution on promoting international cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy, unanimously adopted by the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly on December 4, 1954. At this conference, scientists from various countries will discuss the issue of using atomic energy for peaceful purposes and exchange experiences in this area of research. The Soviet Union's report on the Soviet Union's atomic energy power station and the development of atomic power is also included on the agenda of this conference. It is a major event in current international life that thousands of scientists from more than seventy countries are gathering for the first time to discuss this issue of urgent concern to the people of the world.
    The discovery of atomic energy is a great crystallization of human wisdom and a result of the highly developed modern science and technology. If atomic energy is used for peaceful construction, it can benefit mankind and push the world's civilization to new heights; however, if it is used for war, it will bring enormous destruction and unprecedented disasters to the world. Therefore, the people of the world strongly demand that atomic energy, this great discovery of human wisdom, be used for peaceful purposes, rather than for manufacturing weapons of mass slaughter. This is their expectation for the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy.
    The Soviet Union, proceeding from its basic policy of seeking continuous rise of social economy and culture and the progress of all mankind, and from its peaceful diplomatic policy of promoting international cooperation, has consistently carried out unremitting struggle to prohibit atomic weapons, eliminate the threat of atomic war, and enable atomic energy to be used for peaceful purposes. The Soviet Union was the first country to apply atomic energy to peaceful construction. Today, its scientific and technological development in this regard is the most advanced in the world. The Soviet Union's brilliant achievements in this area have provided an inspiring example to the people of the world. The world's first atomic energy power station built by the Soviet Union has been supplying industrial electricity for more than a year, and it is currently building larger and more economical atomic energy power stations. At the same time, the Soviet Union is also increasingly widely using atomic energy in industry, agriculture, biology, and medicine. The Soviet Union has also signed agreements with our country and the Eastern European People's Democratic countries to help these countries peacefully utilize atomic energy, and has stated that it will expand the scope of countries to which it provides assistance. The Soviet Union's proactive attitude in introducing its experience in establishing atomic energy power stations at this International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy proves the Soviet Union's sincere hope that the limitless potential of atomic energy can be most widely used for the benefit of mankind. There is no doubt that if the Soviet Union's attitude and actions of practically using atomic energy for peaceful construction can be promoted through this conference to all countries that have mastered atomic energy science and technology, then international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy can achieve greater results.
    In order to ensure that atomic energy is only used for peaceful purposes, and that the fruits of human labor are not threatened by large-scale destruction, it is necessary to prohibit its use for the purpose of war and the slaughter of mankind. Therefore, while developing the peaceful use of atomic energy and promoting international cooperation, the Soviet Union firmly advocates the prohibition and destruction of atomic weapons. This proposition is gaining widespread support from the people of the world. The signatures of hundreds of millions of people in various countries on the World Peace Council's "Appeal to the People of the World Against Atomic Weapons" demonstrate the enormous scale of this movement. The Asian-African Conference, attended by twenty-nine countries with a population of over 1.4 billion, emphasized the special significance of developing the peaceful uses of atomic energy for Asian and African countries, and considered the prohibition of the production, testing, and use of nuclear weapons to be an urgent need. The resolutions of the World Peace Congress and the World Mother's Congress also emphasized the prohibition of atomic weapons, advocating that atomic energy should only be used for peaceful purposes. The World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, currently being held in Hiroshima, Japan, centrally expresses the firm will of the people of all countries to resolutely demand that atomic energy not be used for war but only for peaceful construction.
    The current development of the international situation provides favorable conditions for promoting international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy and the prohibition of atomic weapons. The positive achievements of the Four-Power Summit Conference have created a good start for cooperation among the major powers after the war. In their instructions to the foreign ministers, the heads of government of the four powers instructed their representatives on the Subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission to consider the opinions and suggestions put forward by the heads of government of the four powers at the Geneva Conference. Undoubtedly, the achievements that the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy can achieve will greatly help promote the work of the Subcommittee of the Disarmament Commission and enable it to make progress.
    In this regard, people are looking at the United States with anticipation. The United States has stated more than once that atomic energy should be used for peaceful purposes. U.S. President Eisenhower also said that he welcomed the representatives of all countries participating in the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy to act in accordance with the principle of "using atomic science entirely for the benefit of mankind, rather than for the destruction of mankind." The people of the world welcome this attitude. Based on this attitude, people believe that continuing propaganda and preparations for atomic war are not in line with the Geneva spirit, nor will they be beneficial to the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy.
    The Chinese people have always advocated and been concerned about the peaceful use of atomic energy. The signatures of over 400 million Chinese people on the World Peace Council's "Appeal to the People of the World" not only demonstrate the Chinese people's will to demand the prohibition of atomic weapons, but also express the Chinese people's determination to develop the peaceful uses of atomic energy. However, this International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy has not invited representatives of the People's Republic of China, which has nearly a quarter of the world's population, to participate, but has allowed representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which has long been spurned by the Chinese people, to participate. The Chinese people cannot but express great regret over this.
    The sacred duty of scientists living in the atomic age is to do everything possible to ensure that atomic energy and all scientific achievements are not used for war destruction, but for peaceful construction. The Chinese people and the people of the world all place ardent hope on the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, hoping that the scientists of various countries participating in the conference can, in accordance with the spirit of cooperation and understanding of the Four-Power Summit Conference, work together to make this international conference a success, so as to move forward towards extensive international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy.

### 促进和平利用原子能的国际合作

    促进和平利用原子能的国际合作
    和平利用原子能国际会议今天在日内瓦开会了。这次会议是根据联合国大会第九届会议在一九五四年十二月四日一致通过的关于促进和平利用原子能方面的国际合作的决议召开的。在这次会议上，各国科学家们将讨论把原子能用于和平目的的问题，并交换有关这方面研究的经验。苏联关于苏联原子能电力站和原子能力学发展的报告也列入这次会议的议程。七十几个国家的上千个科学家们第一次集会讨论这个全世界人民迫切关心的问题，这是目前国际生活中一件重大的事情。
    原子能的发现是人类智慧的伟大结晶，是现代科学技术高度发展的成果。原子能用于和平建设，就可以造福人类，把世界的文明推上新的高峰；但是，如果把它用于战争，就会给世界带来巨大的破坏和空前的灾难。因此，全世界人民强烈要求把原子能这个人类智慧的伟大发现用于和平目的，而不用来制造大规模屠杀人类的武器。这是他们对于和平利用原子能国际会议的期待。
    苏联从谋求社会经济和文化不断高涨以及全人类进步的基本政策出发，从促进国际合作的和平外交政策出发，一贯为禁止原子武器，消除原子战争威胁，使原子能用于和平目的而进行不懈的斗争。苏联是第一个把原子能应用于和平建设的国家。今天，它在这方面的科学技术的发展是世界上最先进的。苏联在这方面的光辉成就，已向全世界人民提供了令人鼓舞的榜样。苏联建立的世界上第一个原子能电力站供给工业用电已经一年多了，目前正在建立更加巨大的和更加经济的原子能电力站。同时，苏联在工业、农业、生物和医学各方面也日益广泛地利用原子能。苏联还同我国和东欧人民民主国家签订了帮助这些国家和平利用原子能的协定，并且声明将扩大给予帮助的国家的范围。苏联在这次和平利用原子能国际会议上介绍关于建立原子能电力站经验的主动的态度，证明了苏联真诚地希望能够使无限量的原子能潜力最广泛地为人类的福利服务。毫无疑问，苏联这种从实际上将原子能用于和平建设的态度和行动，如果能够经过这次会议来推广到所有掌握原子能的科学和技术的国家，那末，和平利用原子能的国际合作就能够获得更大的成果。
    为了使原子能只用于和平目的，为了人类的劳动成果不受到大规模的毁灭的威胁，就必须禁止把它用于战争和屠杀人类的目的。因此，苏联在发展原子能的和平利用和推进国际合作的同时，坚决主张禁止和销毁原子武器。而这个主张正在得到全世界人民的普遍拥护。在世界和平理事会反对原子武器的“告全世界人民书”上各国亿万人民的签名，表现了这个运动的巨大规模。拥有十四亿以上人口的二十九个国家参加的亚非会议，强调指出了发展原子能的和平用途对亚非国家的特别意义，并认为禁止生产、试验和使用核子武器是紧迫需要的。世界和平大会和世界母亲大会的决议也强调禁止原子武器，主张原子能只能用于和平目的。正在日本广岛举行的禁止原子弹、氢弹世界大会，集中地表现了各国人民坚决要求原子能不准用于战争而只能用于和平建设的坚强意志。
    目前国际局势的发展给推进和平利用原子能方面的国际合作和禁止原子武器提供了有利的条件。四国政府首脑会议的积极成就已为战后大国间的合作创立了良好的开端。四国政府首脑会议在给外长们的指示中，指示他们在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会的代表考虑四国政府首脑们在日内瓦会议上提出的意见和建议。无疑地，和平利用原子能国际会议所能够获得的成就，将大大有助于推动裁军委员会小组委员会的工作，使之取得进展。
    在这方面，人们都以期待的眼光望着美国。美国曾不止一次地表示应该和平利用原子能。美国总统艾森豪威尔也说，欢迎参加和平利用原子能国际会议的各国代表，按照“把原子科学完全用来为人类谋福利，而不是用来毁灭人类”的原则办事。世界人民欢迎这种态度。根据这种态度，人们认为继续关于原子战争的宣传和准备既同日内瓦精神不符，对于和平利用原子能国际会议也不会有好处。
    中国人民一向主张和关心和平利用原子能。四亿多中国人在世界和平理事会“告全世界人民书”上的签名，不仅显示了中国人民要求禁止原子武器的意志，而且表现了中国人民发展原子能的和平用途的决心。然而，这次和平利用原子能国际会议却没有邀请拥有世界人口近四分之一的中华人民共和国的代表参加，而竟容许早已被中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石集团的代表参加。中国人民不能不对此表示很大的遗憾。
    生活于原子时代的科学家们的神圣职责就是：竭尽一切力量使原子能和所有的科学成就不用于战争破坏，而用于和平建设。中国人民和全世界人民都对和平利用原子能国际会议寄予殷切的希望，希望参加会议的各国科学家们，能够根据四国政府首脑会议的合作和谅解的精神，共同努力把这次国际会议开好，以便向和平利用原子能方面的国际广泛合作前进。全国学生代表大会向毛主席致敬电敬爱的毛主席：
    我们，中华全国学生第十六届代表大会的全体代表，在大会胜利闭幕的时候，怀着万分敬爱的心情，向您——亲爱的领袖和导师，致以最热烈、最崇高的敬意！

    我们向您保证：我们决心要努力学习马克思列宁主义，积极参加社会政治活动，加强劳动锻炼，努力改造思想，养成克勤克俭、艰苦朴素的品质，使自己成为具有共产主义世界观，热爱劳动，热爱劳动人民，为社会主义事业忠诚服务的革命知识分子。我们要努力提高阶级觉悟和政治警惕性，勇敢地投入肃清反革命的阶级斗争的激流，把暗藏在学校中的一切反革命分子清除干净。
    我们向您保证：我们要努力学习文化科学知识，掌握最先进的科学技术，使自己具有真实本领，为建设社会主义更好地劳动。
    我们向您保证：我们要加强体育锻炼，增强体质。我们热烈拥护国家兵役法，并殷切地盼望及早在学校实施军事训练，学习军事知识和技能。我们要继承和发扬中国人民解放军爱国主义和革命英雄主义的传统，随时准备着响应祖国的召唤，为解放台湾和保卫和平而坚决斗争。我们不但要做社会主义的积极建设者，而且要做伟大祖国的英勇保卫者。
    毛主席，千言万语表达不尽我们要向您所说的话，我们只好怀着感激和热爱的心情，谨向您再一次保证：我们一定要永远听从您的教导，决心做您的好儿女和好学生。祝您永远健康！
