    He Received Criticism Afterwards
    Liu Zhanyi

    It was half an hour before the lunch break. Director Zhang had said he was going to the construction site, but he didn't go. Instead, he picked up the small newspaper published by the Engineering Bureau's Party Committee. He looked at the fourth page first, as was his habit. What was there to see in a small newspaper? The big news was similar to that in the "People's Daily" and the provincial newspapers, and there was nothing new about the bureau's affairs. Only the "Culture Corner" on the fourth page was a little interesting: character puzzles, some easy to guess, some that really made you think for a while. The "Think About It" thing wasn't simple either; try using ten matchsticks to make five triangles. Our Director Zhang often spent half an hour on this, with a cigarette in his mouth. But today, when he looked at the fourth page, he was first drawn to a cartoon. The cartoon depicted a cadre, nose in the air, chest out, striding over a high jump bar that was practically on the ground. The title was in quotation marks: "Exceeding the Quota." Director Zhang opened his mouth slightly, revealing a hint of a smile, as if to say, "How wicked! These pen-pushers are always trying to find ways to dig at people!"

    His eyes moved to a short essay next to it. As he read, his smile disappeared, his brow furrowed, his neck muscles bulged, and even the tip of his nose turned red. He slammed the newspaper on the table and shouted at the timekeeper behind him, "Xiao Huang, did you do this?"

    Xiao Huang was startled and asked in a fluster, "What's the matter, Director?"

    "Take a look, isn't this me they're drawing?"

    Xiao Huang took the newspaper and looked at the cartoon, almost bursting out laughing. Although the drawing wasn't very skillful, the upturned nose and the arrogant look in the eyes were exactly Director Zhang's characteristics.

    "Cartoons and short essays, even mentioning my name. Where is the spirit of goodwill? Look at how they've drawn me! Is my nose like this?"

    Xiao Huang was still reading the short essay, wanting to laugh but not daring to, looking very awkward.

    "What are you laughing at? I know you're the one behind this. You have access to the statistical data. If you didn't write the essay, who did? How else could they know so much detail?"

    "Director, there's a name signed here!"

    Director Zhang was obviously so angry that he didn't even look closely at the signature. He snatched the newspaper, looked at it, and then rolled his eyes. "Yang Qing? Who is this? Hmph, using a fake name, I'll find out. Just you wait and see!"

    At that moment, the strains of the Liberation Army March came from the loudspeaker; it was lunchtime. Xiao Huang quietly slipped out to eat. Director Zhang was still fuming.

    He suddenly thought of someone, slapped the back of his head, and said, "That's right, it must be her, that little girl! Just because you're the section chief's girlfriend, you criticize people randomly! You think that if you remove the '秀' (xiu) from your name, people won't know it's you?"

    He picked up the telephone receiver, grabbed the crank, and shook it hard, as if the telephone had a deep grudge against him.

    "I want the finance office... Finance office? Find Yang Xiuqing. What, gone to eat? I have urgent business, find her for me..." After waiting for about three minutes, he heard a female voice in the earpiece say "Ah," and he unleashed a torrent of abuse: "Do you understand the situation? What gives you the right to criticize people randomly? What? Not criticizing? Who are you?... Telephone operator? Bah! Who's looking for you? ... Hello, connect me to the finance office! Ah? No one's answering? Why didn't you say so earlier?" He slammed the receiver down with a "bang."

    Xiao Huang had already finished his lunch and returned. He said to him, "Go eat, Director. The cooks are clearing the tables."

    He stomped towards the dining hall. He felt as if everyone who saw him was laughing, and the laughter was full of thorns, making him feel uncomfortable all over. As he ate, he frowned and muttered, "Humph, I can't beat you, you little girl? With that face, covered in freckles, and a small steelyard weight for a nose, you dare to criticize people? Bah!" With this "Bah!", he sprayed a mouthful of rice all over the floor. He simply put down his bowl and refused to eat any more.

    Back in the office, he grabbed the phone again: "Connect me to the finance office... Find Yang Xiuqing... Hello, I say, what kind of work style is this, throwing grenades without understanding the situation?... I'm talking about that damn article... What? My attitude is not right?... I don't need you to give me a political lesson. I would like to ask, do you understand the principles of criticism?... What, you didn't write anything?... Good!" The phone "bang" was hung up.

    Director Zhang filtered through the minds of everyone in the construction site who could write and who often gave opinions. Suddenly, he thought of someone again and asked Xiao Huang, "Did the technician Hu Junqing from the Second Construction Area ask you for statistical data a few days ago?"

    Xiao Huang thought for a moment and said, "There was such a thing."

    "Go and call him here!"

    Hu Junqing arrived. Director Zhang, because he had been rash in dealing with Yang Xiuqing just now, tried his best to suppress his anger this time and deliberately beat around the bush, asking: "Today's newspaper criticized our construction site for setting the quotas too low across the board, saying that we are cheating to get good results, don't you think that's not getting along with us?"

    Unexpectedly, Hu Junqing readily admitted, "That manuscript was written by me and Comrade Yang from the newspaper's editorial department."

    "Oh! So that's where Yang Qing came from, it turns out it was the two of you who put it together. Xiao Huang, you go out first." He paused, then said to Hu Junqing, "Alright, Comrade Technician, let's sit down and have a good talk, what do you mean by writing this manuscript?"

    "Nothing, it's to improve the work."

    "If there are any major opinions, can't they be resolved internally, why do you have to give me a heavy blow in the newspaper?"

    "I have raised my opinion with you, you probably forgot, Director!"

    "Lowering the quotas, I'm also trying to win honor for everyone!"

    "Honor is not won this way. This is letting the country suffer a loss and gilding one's own face."

    "Ah, you're lecturing me too, you're worthy!" Director Zhang's stomach full of anger finally erupted: "When I joined the revolution, you were still wearing open-crotch pants. You dare to contradict me like this in front of me, what is this if not disrespecting leadership and disregarding organizational discipline? Attacking leaders and elevating oneself, this is serious individualism and upward climbing thought. Give me a good reflection, I give you three days to write a good review and submit it to me!"

    The phone was inconsiderate and kept ringing non-stop while Director Zhang was ranting. Director Zhang copied the earpiece and shouted angrily, "Who are you looking for? What's the matter?" But for some reason, his expression and voice suddenly underwent a 180-degree change: "I didn't know it was you, Director. ... Who said that? How can I investigate the person who wrote the manuscript? I wanted to find out the situation and exchange opinions. ... Self-criticism? ... Yes, yes. I will write it right away."

    Director Zhang, like a deflated ball, waved his hand weakly to let Hu Junqing go, and then took out a handkerchief to wipe the sweat from his forehead, as if the temperature in the room had suddenly increased by dozens of degrees.

### 他受了批评以后

    他受了批评以后
    刘占一
    离午间休息还有半点钟。张主任本来说要到工地去的，可是他没有去，却顺手拿起工程局党委会出版的小报。他先看第四版，这是他看报的习惯。小报有什么可看的？大事情是和“人民日报”、省里的报纸差不多的，本局的事情，也没有什么新鲜的，只是第四版上的“文化宫”，还有点意思：组字画，有的很好猜，有的还真够你捉摸一阵子哩；“想想看”这玩意儿也不简单，你试用十根火柴杆摆出五个三角形吧。咱们的张主任，常常叨根烟卷，在这上面花上半个多钟头。可是今天，他一看第四版，先被一幅漫画吸引住了。那幅漫画，画的是一个干部，鼻孔朝天，挺胸腆肚，如履平地地跨过了几乎摆在地面上的跳高的标竿。标题是放在引号里的“超额完成任务”。张主任把嘴稍微裂开了一点，露出了一丝笑容，仿佛说：“真缺德！这帮耍笔杆的专门想法子挖苦人！”
    他的眼睛又移到了旁边的一篇小品文上。看着看着，他的笑容消失了，眉头拧成了结，脖筋涨起老高，连鼻头都涨得发红了。他把报纸向桌子上一摔，就喊身后的那个计工员：“小黄，是你搞的吧？”
    小黄吓了一跳，慌里慌张地问道：“什么事，主任？”
    “你看看，这画的不是我吗？”
    小黄接过报纸，看了看那幅漫画，差点没有笑出来。那幅画虽然画得不很高明，可是那翘起的鼻子，斜着眼睛瞅人的那副高傲的神情，却正是张主任的特点。
    “又是漫画，又是小品文，居然把老子的大名也点出来了。这，这哪里有一点与人为善的精神？瞧，把我画成了什么样子？我的鼻子是这样的吗？”
    小黄还在看那篇小品文，想笑又不敢笑，样子显得很尴尬。
    “你笑什么，我知道就是你搞的鬼。你掌握统计材料，小品文不是你写的，是谁？别人怎么能够知道的那么详细？”
    “主任，人家这里署着名字呢！”
    主任显然气得连署名都没有细看。他一把抢过报纸来，看了看，又转起眼珠来了：“杨清？这是谁？哼，用了假名字，我也查得出。咱们等着瞧！”
    这时，外边的播音器传出解放军进行曲的歌声，午间休息的时间到了。小黄悄悄地溜出去，吃饭去了。张主任还在那里鼓气。
    他忽然想起一个人，一拍后脑勺说：“对，准是她，这个丫头片子，仗着你是科长的爱人，就乱批评人！你当你把名字当中的秀字去掉，别人就不知道是你啦？”
    他拿起电话耳机，抓住摇把死劲地摇，就像电话机子跟他有多大仇似的。
    “我要财务室……财务室吗？找杨秀清。什么，吃饭去啦？我有要紧事，你给我找一找……”等了约有三分钟，听见耳机里一个女的“啊”了一声，他就放开连珠炮了：“你了解情况吗？你仗着什么乱批评人？什么？没批评？你是谁？……总机值班电话员？啐！谁找你啦，……喂喂，接财务室！啊？没人接？没人你不早说。”他“当”地一声把耳机放下了。
    小黄已经吃完饭回来了，对他说：“快吃饭去吧，主任。炊事员要收拾桌子了。”
    他气冲冲地向饭厅走去。他仿佛觉得看到他的人，都在笑，而且笑里都有刺，刺得他浑身不舒服。他一面吃饭还一面皱着眉头发狠：“吓，我斗不过你这个小丫头片子？就凭那个长像，满脸雀斑，小秤砣鼻子，你也配批评人？呸！”他这一“呸”，把满嘴的饭喷了一地。他索性撂下碗，不吃了。
    回到办公室，他又抓起了电话：“接财务室……找杨秀清……喂，我说你这是什么作风，不了解情况就乱放手榴弹？……我说的就是那篇混帐文章……什么？态度不对头？……用不着你给我上政治课。我倒要请问，你懂得批评的原则性吗？……怎么，你什么也没有写？……好！”电话“当”地
  一声挂上了。
    张主任把工地上所有能写稿的人，常提意见的人，都在脑子里滤了一遍。忽然，他又想起一个人，问小黄道：“前两天二工区的技术员胡俊清是不是找你要过统计材料？”
    小黄想了想，说：“有这么一回事。”
    “你去把他叫来！”
    胡俊清来了。张主任因为方才和杨秀清打交道，冒失了，所以这次尽量压着火气，故意绕了个圈子，问道：“今天小报上有人批评咱们工地把各项定额普遍定低了，说咱们骗取成绩，你说，这不是和咱们过不去吗？”
    不料胡俊清却坦然地承认道：“那稿子是我和小报编辑部杨同志合写的。”
    “噢！我说哪里钻出来一个杨清，原来是你们两个凑起来的。小黄，你先出去一下。”他把话顿了一顿，又对胡俊清说：“好吧，技术员同志，咱们坐下来好好谈谈，你写这篇稿子是什么意思？”
    “没什么意思，是为了改进工作。”
    “有什么大不了的意见，内部解决不了，偏要在报纸上兜头给我一闷棍？”
    “意见向你提过的，大概你又忘了，主任！”
    “降低定额，我也是为大家争取荣誉呀！”
    “荣誉不是这样争取的。这是让国家吃亏，往自己脸上贴金。”
    “啊吓，你也教训起我来了，你也配！”张主任的一肚子怒火终于爆发了：“老子参加革命的时候，你还穿活裆裤哪。当着我的面，你还敢这样顶撞，这不是目无领导，目无组织纪律是什么？打击领导，抬高自己，这是严重的个人主义，向上爬思想。你给我好好反省反省，限你三天，把检讨书写好，交给我！”
    电话也不知趣，偏偏在张主任大发雷霆的时候，“叮铃铃”地响个不停。张主任抄过耳机，怒冲冲地喊道：“找谁？什么事？”可是不知怎的，他的神情和声音忽然有了一百八十度的大转变：“不知道是您，局长。……这是谁说的？我怎么能追查写稿子的人呢？我是想了解一下情况，交换交换意见。……检讨？……是是。我马上就写。”
    张主任像个泄了气的皮球，无力地挥了挥手，要胡俊清走，然后就掏出手巾来擦满脑门子上的汗，仿佛屋子里的温度一下子增高了几十度似的。
