Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 23rd: According to Indian news sources: India has requested that the next session of the United Nations General Assembly discuss two issues related to Korean War prisoners of war.

On August 22nd, India submitted a formal request to the United Nations Secretary-General in New York to include the following two items on the supplementary agenda of the United Nations General Assembly: (1) The report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in Korea; (2) The issue of former Korean prisoners of war seeking settlement abroad.

India was the chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, which handled the exchange of prisoners of war after the Korean armistice. The other countries working in this five-nation body were Poland, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland. The Commission submitted a report to the United Nations last year on the issue of exchanging prisoners of war, but that report has not been publicly discussed.

The second item involves fifty-six Korean prisoners of war who have expressed a desire to go to Mexico. They have remained in India, along with their thirty-two companions who have expressed a desire to settle in India, pending the completion of arrangements.

　　印度要求联大讨论有关朝鲜战俘两个问题
    新华社新德里二十三日电　据印度新闻处消息：印度已经要求联合国大会下一届会议讨论有关朝鲜战争战俘的两个问题。
    八月二十二日，印度在纽约把一封正式的请求书送交联合国秘书长，要求把下列两个项目列入联合国大会的补充议程：（一）朝鲜中立国遣返委员会的报告；（二）要求定居国外的前朝鲜战俘问题。
    印度是在朝鲜停战后处理战俘交换工作的中立国遣返委员会的主席。在这个五国机构中工作的其他国家是波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞典和瑞士。委员会在去年曾向联合国提出关于交换战俘问题的报告，但是那个报告一直没有被公开讨论。
    第二个项目牵涉五十六个朝鲜战俘。他们表示希望到墨西哥去。在安排还没有完成以前，他们一直留在印度，和他们的三十二个表示希望在印度定居的同伴在一起。
