To the Editor:

    The extravagance and waste at the Hebei Worker's Junior Middle School in Shijiazhuang are very serious. The school buildings are built very luxuriously. For example, the lobby of the education building has an area of ​​150 square meters, the floor is entirely made of terrazzo, and the hall is decorated with pebble-wash murals. The construction area of ​​the office building is also excessively large. More than 7,000 yuan was invested in greening the campus. In addition, a fountain, a lighted ball field, and a luxuriously decorated dining hall were built.

    Due to blind purchasing, the school has also accumulated a large amount of furniture and teaching equipment. They prepared beds, desks and chairs, and other furniture for 1,500 students and more than 200 faculty and staff households. However, in reality, there are only 1,000 students and less than 200 faculty and staff households. This batch of stockpiled materials is worth more than 38,000 yuan. They spent a lot of money to buy a batch of instruments that are not needed by junior middle schools. In addition, the school's warehouse also has a stockpiled surgical kit worth 500 yuan, a mimeograph worth 350 yuan, 3,500 light bulbs, and more than 100 sofas, swivel chairs, and varnished cloth chairs, etc., worth many yuan.

    The school also wastes a lot of stationery and other office supplies. For example, a pen nib can generally be used for one to two months, but the school gives each student two pen nibs every month. The mathematics group is supposed to use only 200 lesson plan sheets per month according to regulations, but in reality, they always use 4,000 sheets. Several dozen extra copies of lecture notes are printed each time, and as a result, they are stockpiled. The library does not have strict borrowing procedures, and many books and magazines are lost.

    The school's leaders are indifferent to this waste. They said: "We have no experience in running a school, and some small waste is inevitable." We believe that all waste is shameful and should never be excused for any reason. What's more, the waste in this school is no longer "small waste" but rather serious waste. The reason for the waste is not "lack of experience" but a desire to show off and a lack of responsibility for state property. Therefore, we ask the school's leading authorities to seriously investigate this issue and give serious criticism to those responsible for the waste.

    这是“小浪费”吗？编辑同志：
    石家庄华北职工初级中学的铺张浪费现象十分严重。这个学校的校舍建筑得很豪华。例如教育楼的门厅面积有一百五十平方公尺，地面全部采用美术水磨石，厅内还装饰了水刷石的彩画。办公楼的建造面积也是过大的。为了绿化校园，投资共七千多元。另外，还修建了喷水池、灯光球场和装饰华丽的大饭厅。
    由于盲目购置，这个学校还积压了大量的家具和教学设备。他们按照一千五百名学员和二百多户教职员工准备了床铺和桌椅等家具，但是实际上学员只有一千人，教职员工也没有两百户，这一批积压物资价值就达三万八千多元。他们花很多钱买了一批仪器，都是初级中学用不着的。另外，学校的库房里还积压有价值五百元的手术箱、价值三百五十元的速印机、三千五百个电灯泡、一百多件沙发、转椅、漆布椅等。
    这个学校浪费的文具和其他办公用品也很多。例如一个钢笔尖一般可以用一个月到两个月，但学校每月给每个学生发两个笔尖。数学组按规定每月用二百张教案纸就够了，而实际上总要用四千张。印讲义每次多印几十份，结果都被积压起来。图书馆没有严密的借阅手续，丢失的书报杂志很多。
    学校的领导人员对这种浪费行为还感到无所谓。他们说：“我们办学校没有经验，有些小浪费是不可避免的。”我们认为，一切浪费都是可耻的，决不应该用任何借口来原谅自己。何况这个学校的浪费，已经不是什么“小浪费”，而是相当严重的浪费；造成浪费的原因也不是“没有经验”，而是讲排场和对国家财产不负责任。因此，我们要求这个学校的领导机关认真检查这个问题，给造成浪费的有关人员以严肃的批评。群映　检浪
