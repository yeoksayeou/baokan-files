Medical institutions must further eliminate food waste.

Jin Lin

During the food saving campaign, many collective mess halls have checked for food waste, and food waste in medical institutions is relatively common and serious. According to the situation in several hospitals in Beijing, before the launch of the saving campaign, Peking Union Medical College Hospital had to pour away three large gasoline barrels of leftover food every day; Tongren Hospital and Municipal Third Hospital had eight or ninety jin of leftover food every day; Municipal Seventh Hospital collected more than one hundred jin of leftover food from the patient kitchen and various wards in two days, equivalent to forty jin of net grain. The Central People's Hospital had to pour away more than half a bucket of leftover food from each ward every day. An old worker in a food room said that he felt heartache every time he poured these things away, but he couldn't deal with it if he didn't pour it away, so he had to close his eyes and pour it away. In hospitals in some other cities, the phenomenon of pouring away entire buckets of food is also quite common.

Waste of patient food has been considered unavoidable. Almost all hospitals implement a habitual system: regardless of the patient's condition, the amount of food, or whether there is any change, a serving of food is delivered on time as usual every day. Some hospitals discard the food as soon as it is taken into the ward, regardless of whether the patient touches it. Why do they do this? The hospital believes that patients pay for food when they are hospitalized, so food should be delivered on time; the patients think that the hospital routinely serves food, regardless of saving or waste, because they have already paid for it. In addition, the lack of contact between various departments of the hospital is also an important reason for food waste in the wards. Sometimes patients stop eating before surgery, but the kitchen doesn't know, so they still serve food. Sometimes the food is delivered when the patient has already been discharged. This often and massively causes food waste.

After the launch of the food saving campaign, many medical staff began to insufficiently recognize the seriousness of food waste in hospitals and had varying degrees of resistance to saving requirements. Some people believe that there are special reasons for waste in hospitals, which cannot be compared with general institutions and groups, and that leftover food in the wards has "always been like this" and is unavoidable; some people also see that food waste is very serious, but they think it is not easy to change the old methods. In short, they think there are many specific difficulties in food saving in hospital wards. These ideas have gradually changed after repeated publicity and education and specific trials of saving methods. Some hospital directors personally went deep into the wards and kitchens to conduct inspections, study food saving methods, and help medical staff understand the importance of food saving ideologically. Many wastes that were originally considered unavoidable have been avoided, and many old systems and habits have been changed. For example, Tongren Hospital, which had serious waste in the past, has reduced waste of food in wards from eighty or ninety jin to a few jin every day after inspection and improvement, and some wards have no leftover food at all. Beijing Municipal Third Hospital, from doctors to cooks, has formulated a food saving pact, stipulated methods of mutual contact, and changed the method of distributing food by portion from the kitchen to distributing it in the wards, giving less and adding more frequently, which greatly reduced the phenomenon of leftover food waste in the wards. Hospitals generally formulate food saving methods according to the specific conditions of their units to reduce food waste.

The effective measures taken by the hospitals are approximately as follows: First, the "three diligence" system is universally promoted, that is, when delivering food to patients, be diligent in asking, adding, and taking away. Understand the patient's needs in advance, send less each time, add more times, don't be afraid of trouble, and try to deliver food according to the patient's specific condition and changes in food intake. Second, strengthen the cooperation and contact between doctors, nurses, nutrition rooms, and cooks and food delivery personnel to avoid the food waste caused by the past lack of coordination. Nursing staff should promptly notify food changes according to the patient's condition, such as stopping food before surgery, etc. The nutrition room and cooks can also often contact the wards to understand the patient's condition and cook food according to needs. Some hospitals have also changed the past habits, and nurses also participate in serving food, assisting the cooks in their work, and treating the patient's eating problem as an inseparable part of medical care. Third, try to avoid leftovers in cooking and properly handle leftovers. For example, steam smaller steamed buns, and use smaller bowls for serving rice. Except for leftovers that are indeed at risk of infection and must be discarded, leftover food should be disinfected, steamed, and reused as much as possible. In addition, strengthen education for patients, publicize the significance of saving food, and mobilize them to save automatically, asking for as much as they want. Beijing Municipal Third and Seventh Hospitals and other units also plan to implement a menu selection system to try to make the diet suitable for the patient's needs and further eliminate food waste.

Facts have proved that food waste in hospital wards can be avoided, and the amount of food saved is quite considerable. For example, Beijing Municipal Fifth Hospital, which is not very large, used to waste about four hundred jin of food a month, but now it only wastes about twenty jin a month. Other larger hospitals with better food saving campaigns have saved even more. As long as all medical staff truly recognize the great significance of saving food and work together to find ways to improve their work, it is possible to save more food for the country. At present, the progress of food saving work in various medical units is not balanced, and some units still have considerable waste. The leaders of each hospital should consolidate existing achievements, further adopt food saving methods, and push the food saving work further forward.

    医疗机关要进一步消除粮食浪费现象
    金林
    在节约粮食运动中，不少集体伙食单位都检查了浪费粮食的现象，其中医疗机构的粮食浪费是较为普遍而严重的。根据北京市几个医院的情况来说，在节约运动开展以前，协和医院每天要倒掉三大汽油桶剩饭菜；同仁医院、市立第三医院每天要剩饭菜八九十斤；市立第七医院，两天内收集病人厨房和各病房的剩饭菜共一百多斤，合净粮四十斤。中央人民医院每个病房每天要倒掉多半桶饭菜。一个食品房的老工人说，每次倒这些东西时都觉得心疼，不倒又无法处理，只好闭起眼睛倒。在其他一些城市的医院里，整桶饭菜倒掉的现象也是相当普遍的。
    病人伙食的浪费，曾被认为是不可避免的。几乎所有的医院都执行一种习惯的制度：不管病人病情如何，食量大小、有无变化，每天按时照例一律送饭一份。有些医院饭菜一拿入病房，不管病人动不动，一律废弃不再用。为什么要这样做呢？在医院方面认为病人住院出饭钱，就应该按时送饭；在病人方面以为医院照例开饭，不管节约浪费，反正已经花过钱。另外，医院各部门缺少联系，也是造成病房粮食浪费的一个重要原因。有时病人在施行手术前停食，伙房不知道，也照样开饭，有时饭送来病人已经出院，这样经常而大量地造成了粮食的浪费。
    节约粮食运动开展以后，许多医护人员开始对医院浪费粮食的严重情况认识不足，对节约要求有程度不等的抵触情绪。有些人认为医院浪费有特殊原因，不能同一般机关团体相比，认为病房剩饭“历来如此”，不可避免；有些人也看到粮食浪费很严重，可是又认为改变旧办法不容易。总之，认为医院病房的粮食节约具体困难很多。这些思想经过反复的宣传教育，和具体试行节约办法以后已逐步有所改变。有些医院院长亲自深入病房、厨房进行检查，研究节约粮食办法，帮助医护人员从思想上认识节约粮食的重要。许多原来认为不可避免的浪费避免了，许多旧的制度和习惯转变了。如过去浪费严重的同仁医院，经过检查改进，现在病房浪费饭菜已由过去每天八九十斤降到几斤，有些病房已完全没有剩饭菜了。北京市立第三医院从医生到炊事人员，都制定了节约粮食的公约，规定了互相联系的办法，并把由厨房按份发饭的办法，改为在病房分发，少给勤添，使病房剩饭浪费的现象大为减少。各医院一般都根据本单位具体情况定出节约粮食的办法，减少粮食的浪费。
    各院采取的有效办法，约有如下几种：首先是普遍推行“三勤”制度，即给病人送饭，勤问、勤添、勤拿。事先了解病人需要，每次少送一些、多添几次，不怕麻烦，尽量做到根据病人具体情况和食量变化送饭。其次是加强医生、护理人员、营养室和炊事、送饭人员的配合和联系，避免过去各不相关所造成的饭菜浪费现象。护理人员根据病人情况及时作好饭食变化通知，如在施行手术前停食等，营养室和炊事人员也能经常和病房联系，了解病人情况，按需要做饭菜。有些医院还改变了过去的习惯，护士也参加开饭，协助炊事人员工作，把病人吃饭问题当作医护工作不可分割的部分。再次，就是在做饭方面尽量避免剩余，作好剩饭的妥善处理。如馒头蒸小些，盛饭的碗改用小碗等。对于剩饭除确有传染危险必须倒掉的以外，把剩余饭菜尽可能经过消毒蒸煮再加利用。此外，加强对病人的教育，宣传节约粮食的意义，动员他们自动节约，吃多少要多少。北京市立第三第七医院等单位，并计划实行食谱挑选制，尽量做到饮食适合病人需要，进一步消除粮食浪费现象。
    事实证明：医院病房的粮食浪费是可以避免的，节约粮食的数目也是颇为可观的。如规模不算很大的北京市立第五医院，过去一月浪费粮食约四百多斤，现在一月不过二十多斤。其他规模较大、节约粮食运动开展较好的医院，节约的数字就更大。只要所有医护人员真正认识到节约粮食的重大意义，共同想办法改进工作，还有可能为国家节约更多的粮食。目前各医疗单位节约粮食工作的进展还不够平衡，有些单位还有相当大的浪费，各院领导方面应该巩固现有成绩，进一步采取节约粮食的办法，把粮食节约工作再向前推进一步。
