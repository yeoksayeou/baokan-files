Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, August 30th -- TASS reports: A mass rally of 200,000 people was held in the Yugoslav city of Karlovac on the 27th, commemorating the tenth anniversary of the uprising and liberation of the Croatian people. Yugoslav President Tito delivered a lengthy speech at the rally.

　　Tito spoke of the great achievements that the Yugoslav people have made in building their beautiful future, and pointed out that in order to industrialize the country and import equipment, Yugoslavia now owes more than 400 million US dollars to foreign countries. Tito said: If West Germany repays the huge pre-war and wartime debts to Yugoslavia according to the London Agreement, Yugoslavia's debts can be greatly reduced. Tito stated: Yugoslavia is demanding that West Germany repay this debt and is prepared to take any possible means to safeguard Yugoslavia's interests.

　　Tito pointed out that the Soviet Union had set an example in resolving the debt issue. He said that during the Belgrade talks, the Soviet Union had already cancelled more than 90 million US dollars of Yugoslavia's debt. He expressed the hope that other Eastern European countries would also follow this path.

　　Tito then spoke about the international situation. He expressed satisfaction with the results of the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference. He believed that the conference was filled with a new spirit, and this was a good start. The reason for this new spirit is that the whole world does not want war. Tito then ridiculed those politicians who attempted to use Eisenhower's proposal on the exchange of military intelligence between the Soviet Union and the United States as a propaganda gimmick, pointing out that some foreigners wanted to use this proposal for anti-Soviet propaganda and to undermine the spirit of unity in Geneva. He said that it was foolish to say that the Russians did not want peace, and that it had nothing in common with what the Russians truly hoped for.

　　Tito's speech placed great emphasis on the normalization of Soviet-Yugoslav relations. He said that the normalization and improvement of Soviet-Yugoslav relations were developing successfully. The Soviet Union and Yugoslavia sought a common foundation in the Belgrade talks, which made it easier to begin solving the problems of economic cooperation and other cooperation between the two countries in the future. Tito disagreed with the assertion by some Western figures that Yugoslavia was leaning towards the Soviet camp, saying: We are communists, but we do not want to join any camp.

　　Tito stated that Yugoslavia would not engage in even propaganda battles with such a huge force as the Soviet Union and other Eastern countries in order to cater to the wishes of some people. He also stated that Yugoslavia was willing to conduct economic, cultural, and other exchanges with Eastern European countries.

　　Tito said: Yugoslavia is moving step by step towards normalizing and establishing friendly relations with Eastern countries, while at the same time not relaxing its friendly relations with Western countries in the slightest. Yugoslavia is willing to improve rather than worsen its good relations with the United States, Britain, and all other countries. Naturally, Yugoslavia will not allow any country to interfere in its internal affairs.

　　Tito mentioned the Balkan Pact organization, expressing his disapproval of strengthening the military aspects of the pact and emphasizing the continued development of economic, cultural, and other relations.

　　Tito finally spoke about the recent differences between the two countries regarding Yugoslavia's acceptance of US military aid. Tito said: Yugoslavia once accepted US weapons and accepted US conditions, according to which the United States has the right to supervise how Yugoslavia maintains these weapons. Yugoslavia has always fulfilled these conditions. But now the United States wants to supervise everything. Tito stated: Yugoslavia cannot allow the United States to supervise armed forces equipped not with US weapons but with Yugoslav weapons. Yugoslavia can only continue to accept weapons under the original conditions, regardless of whether the United States continues to supply weapons.

    在卡罗发兹城二十万人群众大会上
    南斯拉夫总统铁托发表演说
    新华社三十日讯　据塔斯社贝尔格莱德讯：南斯拉夫的卡罗发兹城二十七日举行了二十万人的群众大会，纪念克罗地亚人民起义和解放十周年，南斯拉夫总统铁托在会上发表了长篇演说。
    铁托谈到南斯拉夫人民在建设自己美好的未来方面已经取得巨大成就，并且指出：为了国家的工业化和输入装备，南斯拉夫现在欠外国的债务在四亿美元以上。铁托说：如果西德根据伦敦条约付还战前和战时对南斯拉夫的巨额债款，南斯拉夫的债务就可以大大减少。铁托表示：南斯拉夫正在要求西德偿还这笔债款，并且准备采取任何可能的方式来维护南斯拉夫的利益。
    铁托指出苏联在解决债务问题上表现了范例。他说，苏联在贝尔格莱德会谈期间已经取消了南斯拉夫九千万美元以上的债务。他表示希望其他东欧国家也能走这条路。
    铁托接着谈到国际局势。他对日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的结果表示满意。他认为，会议充满了新的精神，这个开端做得很好。这种新精神之所以产生，是因为整个世界都不要战争。铁托然后嘲笑了企图利用艾森豪威尔关于苏美两国交换军事情报的建议作为宣传花招的那些政治家，指出外国某些人想利用这个建议进行反苏宣传，想破坏在日内瓦的一致精神。他说，说俄国人不愿意和平是愚蠢的，这同俄国人真正希望的毫无共同之处。
    铁托的演说非常重视苏南关系正常化的问题。他说，苏南关系的正常化和改进发展得很成功。苏联和南斯拉夫在贝尔格莱德会谈中求得了共同的基础，这就比较容易地着手解决两国今后实行经济合作和其他方面的合作的问题。铁托不同意西方某些人物认为南斯拉夫倒向苏联阵营的说法，他说：我们是共产主义者，但是我们不愿意加入任何阵营。
    铁托表示南斯拉夫不会因为要迎合某些人的愿望，而去同苏联和其他东方国家这样一种巨大的力量进行即使是宣传上的战斗。他也表示南斯拉夫愿意同东欧国家进行经济、文化和其他方面的交流。
    铁托说：南斯拉夫是一步步地朝着同东方各国关系正常化和建立友好关系的方向走去，同时也一步不放松同西方国家的友好关系。南斯拉夫愿意改善而不是恶化同美国、英国和其他一切国家的良好关系，自然，南斯拉夫是不容许任何国家干涉内政的。
    铁托提到巴尔干公约组织，他表示不赞成加强公约的军事方面，而强调继续发展经济、文化和其他方面的关系。
    铁托最后谈到在南斯拉夫接受美国军事援助方面两国最近产生的分歧。铁托说：南斯拉夫曾经接受美国武器并且接受美国的条件，根据这些条件，美国有权监督南斯拉夫怎样保持这些武器。南斯拉夫一直履行着这些条件。但是美国现在却要监督一切。铁托表示：南斯拉夫不能允许美国监督不是用美国武器而是用南斯拉夫武器装备起来的武装部队。南斯拉夫只能在原来的条件下继续接受武器，而不顾美国是否继续供给武器。
