The World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, starting from the 6th, is being held in Hiroshima, Japan. The convening of this conference is a concentrated expression of the firm will and universal desire of the Japanese people and all peace-loving people around the world to oppose atomic warfare and demand the prohibition of atomic weapons. It is a significant contribution to uniting the world's forces for peace and maintaining the international legal order. Peace-loving people all over the world will feel delighted and encouraged by the convening of this world conference.

The World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs was initiated and prepared by the Japanese people and is being held first in Hiroshima, which is of particular significance. Because Japan is the only country that has suffered three times from the scourge of atomic and hydrogen bombs, and Hiroshima was one of the first cities to be destroyed by an atomic bomb.

Ten years ago today—August 6, 1945—the U.S. Air Force dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, and three days later (August 9) dropped the second atomic bomb on Nagasaki. These two atomic bombs caused enormous destruction to those two Japanese cities, killing and injuring many peaceful residents. This act not only seriously violated the basic principles of humanitarianism, but also brutally violated all internationally recognized rules of warfare.

In March 1946, about half a year after the first atomic bomb was dropped, I had the opportunity to visit Hiroshima in person. Although the time for that visit was very short, the scene of Hiroshima after the bombing is still deeply imprinted in my mind and cannot be erased. What I found most unforgettable were the many men, women, old and young who were dying or not yet dead from atomic wounds. It is said that most of them died one after another later. Those who were fortunate enough not to die, some of the younger ones were given by the former Yoshida government of Japan to the American occupation forces to be transported to the U.S. Department of the Army as "guinea pigs" for experiments. I can hardly express my sympathy and concern for the tragic fate of these unfortunate people! Ten years later, I don't know if there are still a few of them alive!

From the moment I saw the scene of Hiroshima after the atomic bombing with my own eyes, I felt a great aversion to the atrocities of using such vicious and inhumane atomic weapons to destroy Japanese rear-area cities and massacre innocent Japanese civilians on a large scale.

Admittedly, Japanese militarism has committed heinous crimes in the world. Their acts of aggression have brought enormous disasters to many countries, especially Asian countries. Taking China as an example, from the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, we suffered the bullying and plundering of Japanese imperialists for fifty years, with huge losses. From the time Japan launched a full-scale invasion of China in 1937 until the end of World War II in 1945, the lives sacrificed in our eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan exceeded ten million, and the property losses were worth hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars.

There is no doubt that the forces of Japanese militarism should be thoroughly eliminated.

However, the U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the extremely brutal massacre of unarmed peaceful residents (most of whom were the elderly, young children, and women), claiming it as a legitimate act of wartime retaliation, is obviously without any justification. This act is an unprecedentedly brutal act in the history of world warfare, no wonder it has aroused the surprise and disgust of people with a little sense of justice and humanitarianism all over the world.

As a person who studies international law, I am particularly indignant at this act of wantonly undermining all the provisions and principles of international law regarding the use of weapons and methods of warfare.

Although modern international law has not yet been able to develop to the point of absolutely prohibiting war, it has made many efforts in stipulating the peaceful settlement of international disputes and denouncing wars of aggression; especially in the area of restricting the use of weapons and methods of warfare by belligerent states, it has established many provisions and principles in the past hundred years.

The main parts of these provisions and principles are already contained in the solemn documents signed by most countries in the world on various occasions. The most important of these documents are the St. Petersburg Declaration of 1868, the Fourth Hague Convention and the Rules of Land Warfare of 1899 and 1907, the Hague Air Warfare Rules of 1923, the Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibiting bacteriological weapons, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of 1948, the Geneva Convention for the Protection of Civilians of 1949, and so on. Most of these documents have been solemnly ratified by the vast majority of countries in the world, and although some of them (such as the Hague Air Warfare Rules) have not been ratified, they are considered to be a derivative application of the basic laws of war and have the nature of declaring international customary law, and thus equally constitute part of the current effective international law provisions and principles. These provisions and principles largely reflect the interests and demands of the people of the world and are generally recognized and should be jointly observed by all countries. No country can claim the right to "stand outside the law" by refusing to ratify a certain document.

The indiscriminate massacre atomic bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as the more destructive hydrogen bombs that some people are clamoring to use now, are completely contrary to the spirit and content of these international documents. If the use of such unprecedentedly cruel weapons is considered legal, then all the provisions and principles of international law regarding the restriction of the use of weapons and methods of warfare for the past hundred years will be completely destroyed and become meaningless.

It must be pointed out that although the use of atomic weapons has been universally condemned by good human beings, and the international situation has now improved somewhat in some respects, the threat of atomic war still exists and has not been eliminated. Some countries have not only not abandoned the intention of atomic war, but are also stepping up preparations for atomic war, defining atomic and hydrogen weapons as conventional weapons; allocating huge amounts of funds for the manufacture of such weapons, continuing to carry out atomic war propaganda, and tirelessly planning atomic war. Therefore, we must maintain a high degree of vigilance against the development of this dark side of the international situation.

On the other hand, what is exciting is that atomic weapons are facing increasing opposition from peace-loving people all over the world; more and more people in various countries are joining the movement against atomic weapons. In the struggle against atomic weapons, the Japanese people have made particularly outstanding performances, earning the admiration of people all over the world. I remember that in 1950, although the Japanese people were under the dual oppression of the American occupation forces and the Yoshida reactionary government, about seven million of them bravely signed their names on the Stockholm Appeal against atomic bombs. In the signature campaign against atomic and hydrogen weapons that began this spring in various parts of the world, more than 30 million Japanese people have participated in signing so far. This movement is still being carried out enthusiastically around the world and has won widespread support from hundreds of millions of people in various countries. There is no doubt that this appeal from every country, every region, every corner of the world is most clearly expressing the universal desire and strong demand of people all over the world to ban atomic war.

The World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs being held in Japan now is a further powerful expression of this desire and demand of the people of the world. It will undoubtedly unite the forces of people all over the world against atomic war more closely and push the movement to defend world peace forward. At the same time, it will also give strong support to the Japanese people's struggle for national independence and against military bases.

As long as the forces of people all over the world against atomic war unite more closely and quickly, we will certainly be able to effectively prevent the reckless actions of atomic maniacs in advance, so that the basic principles of humanitarianism and the international legal order will no longer be damaged, and so that this valuable invention of human genius—atomic energy—can be fully used to improve people's lives and enhance human happiness.

### 使用原子弹和氢弹的暴行不许重演

    使用原子弹和氢弹的暴行不许重演
    前远东国际军事法庭法官　梅汝璈
    从六日起，禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会在日本广岛开始举行。这个大会的召开，是日本人民以及全世界善良人民一致反对原子战争和要求禁止原子武器的坚决意志和普遍愿望的集中表现。它对团结世界和平力量和维护国际法律秩序是一个重大的贡献。全世界爱好和平人民对于这个世界大会的召开都会感到欢欣鼓舞。
    禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会由日本人民发起和筹备，并首先在广岛举行，那是具有特别意义的。因为，日本是唯一遭受过三次原子弹和氢弹祸害的国家，而广岛又是最初被原子弹炸毁过的一个城市。
    十年以前的今天——一九四五年八月六日，美国空军在日本广岛市投下了第一颗原子弹，三天以后（八月九日）又在长崎投下了第二颗原子弹。这两颗原子弹对日本那两个城市造成了极大的破坏，杀伤了许多的和平居民。这个行为不但严重地违反着人道主义的基本准则，而且粗暴地破坏了一切国际间所公认的作战法规。
    在一九四六年三月间，距第一颗原子弹投下大约半年的时光，我曾有机会亲自到广岛去视察一次。虽然那次视察的时间十分短促，但是广岛被炸后的景象，到现在还深深地印在我的脑筋里，不能磨灭。最使我难忘的，是那许多遭受原子创伤将死未死的男女老幼。据说，他们大多数后来陆续死掉了。那些幸而没有死掉的，其中有些比较年轻的被日本前吉田政府赠给美国占领军转运到美国陆军部去做“豚鼠”般的试验品了。对这些不幸人们的悲惨命运，我几乎无法用语言来表示我的同情和关切！在十年后的今天，我不知道他们之中是否还有几个活在人间！
    从我亲眼看到广岛被原子弹炸后的景象时起，我对使用那种穷凶极恶、惨无人道的原子武器去破坏日本后方城市和大规模屠杀日本无辜平民的暴行便发生了极大的反感。
    诚然，日本军国主义曾经在世界上犯下过滔天罪行。他们的侵略行为给许多国家，特别是亚洲各国，带来了巨大的灾难。拿中国来讲，从中日甲午之战起，我们遭受日本帝国主义者的欺凌掠夺达五十年之久，损失浩大。仅自一九三七年日本发动全面侵华起，到一九四五年二次世界大战终结为止，我们在八年对日抗战中所牺牲的生命便在一千万人以上，财产损失价值达数百亿美元。
    日本军国主义势力应该被彻底肃清，那是毫无疑问的。
    但是，美国对广岛、长崎的原子弹轰炸，把手无寸铁的和平居民（其中大部分是老幼妇孺）加以极端野蛮的屠杀，说成是一种战时正当报复行动，显然是没有丝毫道理的。这种举动是世界战争史上从来没有过的残暴行为，无怪乎它引起了全世界稍具正义感和人道观念的人们的惊异和憎恶。
    由于我是一个研究国际法的人，我对于这种肆无忌惮地破坏国际法上关于武器使用及作战方法的一切规定和原则的暴行，特别感到愤慨。
    现代国际法虽然还没有能够发展到绝对禁止战争的地步，然而它在规定以和平方法解决国际争端以及斥责侵略战争等方面却曾作过许多的努力；特别是在关于限制交战国的武器使用和作战方法这些方面，它在近百年来已经建立了许多的规定和原则。
    这些规定和原则的主要部分已经包含在全世界大多数国家所历次参加签订的庄严文件里面。这些文件中最重要的是一八六八年的圣彼德堡宣言，一八九九年及一九○七年的第四海牙公约和陆战规则，一九二三年的海牙空战规则，一九二五年的禁用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书，一九四八年的防止及惩罚屠杀人群罪行公约，一九四九年的日内瓦保护平民公约，等等。这些文件大部分都曾经世界上极大多数国家所郑重批准，其中虽有个别的（如海牙空战规则）未经批准，却也被认为是战争基本法则的引申应用，具有宣示国际习惯法的性质，因而同样构成现行有效的国际法规定和原则的一部分。这些规定和原则在很大程度上是反映着世界人民的利益和要求的，并且是一般国家所公认和应该共同遵守的。任何国家都不能借口拒绝批准某个文件而自认为有权“置身法外”。
    对广岛、长崎所使用过的盲目屠杀的原子弹，以及现在有人叫嚣着要使用的破坏力更大的氢弹，是完全违反着这些国际文件的精神和内容的。倘使这种空前残酷的武器使用被认为合法，那么，百年来国际法上关于限制武器使用和作战方法的一切规定和原则，都将被破坏无遗而变为毫无意义的了。
    必须指出：原子武器的使用虽遭到善良人类的普遍谴责，而国际局势目前在某些方面也获得了一些和缓，但是原子战争的威胁仍然存在着，并未消除。某些国家不但没有放弃原子战争的意图，而且正在加紧准备着原子战争，把原子武器和氢武器定为常规武器；拨出巨大款项用于这种武器的制造，继续进行着原子战争的宣传，并孜孜不息地在那里计划原子战争。因此，对于国际局势中这黑暗一面的发展，我们必须保持高度的警惕。
    在另一方面，令人兴奋的是原子武器正遭到全世界爱好和平的人民愈来愈大的反对；各国人民投入反对原子武器运动中的愈来愈多。在反对原子武器的斗争中，日本人民有着特别卓越的表现，博得全世界人民的敬佩。记得在一九五○年，日本人民虽处于美国占领军和吉田反动政府的双重压迫之下，他们还有约七百万人勇敢地在斯德哥尔摩反对原子弹的宣言上签上了自己的名字。在世界各地今年春天开始举行的禁止原子武器和氢武器的签名运动中，日本人民迄今为止参加签名的已超过三千万人。这个运动现在仍在世界各地热烈地展开，获得各国亿万人民的广泛支持。毫无疑问，这种来自全世界每个国度、每个地区、每个角落的呼吁，正最清晰地表示着全世界人民对于禁止原子战争的普遍愿望和强烈要求。
    现在在日本举行的禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会，是世界人民这种愿望和要求更进一步的有力表现。它无疑地将使全世界人民反对原子战争的力量更加团结起来，并把保卫世界和平运动向前推进一步。同时，对于日本人民争取民族独立、反对军事基地的斗争，它也将给以强有力的支持。
    只要全世界人民反对原子战争的力量更加紧密地和迅速地团结起来，我们一定能够有效地事先制止原子狂人的胡作非为，使人道主义的基本准则和国际间的法律秩序不再遭受破坏，并且使这个人类天才的宝贵发明——原子能得以全部用于改善人民的生活、增进人类的幸福。
