    Installation of Machines at the Expanding Lanzhou Power Plant
    The machine installation project for the expansion of the Lanzhou Power Plant has begun.
    Currently, crane operators have steadily placed the main steel frames of two boilers, each weighing over twenty tons, on the steel frame foundations, and electric welders are busy welding them together. Boiler workers are preparing to lift the large steam drum, and turbine workers have begun the installation of the massive condenser.
    Under the slogan of reducing costs, practicing thrift, and ensuring the completion of the third-quarter task, all employees have launched into intense labor. They studied and applied advanced Soviet experiences such as steel frame combined installation and Soviet chimney combined installation, greatly improving work efficiency. At the same time, they paid attention to saving materials during construction.
    The equipment currently being installed at the Lanzhou Power Plant was originally technologically backward, relying on manual operation for coal transportation and ash removal. Now, to enable it to function effectively, it has been modified to be semi-automatic according to new technical requirements. The employees have carried out heavy and complex overhaul and fitting work. Every part of the machine has been overhauled, and many accessories have been fitted.
    The ongoing installation project will be completed in the fourth quarter. After the expanded equipment is put into production, the power generation capacity of the Lanzhou Power Plant will increase by nearly six-fifths compared to the present, which can further meet the needs of Lanzhou's large-scale industrial construction.

    扩建中的兰州电厂安装机器
    兰州电厂扩建工程的机器安装工程已经开始。
    现在起重工已把两个重约二十多吨的锅炉主体钢架平稳地安放在钢架基础上，电火焊工人忙着在上面焊结。锅炉工正在着手起吊大汽包的准备工作，汽机工也开始了庞大的复水器的安装。
    全体职工在降低造价、厉行节约、保证完成第三季度任务的口号下展开了紧张的劳动。他们学习并运用了苏联钢架组合安装、苏联烟筒组合安装等先进经验，大大提高了工作效率，同时还注意在施工中节约使用材料。
    兰州电厂目前正在安装的这一设备，原来技术很落后，输煤、除灰等都靠手工操作。现在为了让它能够很好地发挥作用，根据新的技术要求改为半自动化。职工们进行了繁重复杂的检修配制工作。机器的每一部分都作了检修，并配制了许多附件。
    正在进行的安装工程将在第四季度完工。扩建的设备投入生产以后，兰州电厂发电能力将较现在增加近六分之五，可进一步满足兰州大规模工业建设的需要。　（本报驻兰州记者）
