Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, August 21st: The Latin American Countries' Conference for the Defense of Freedom was recently held in Santiago, Chile. The conference was attended by 170 delegates from most American countries.

　　The Chairman of the Conference Preparatory Committee, Brest, Chairman of the Chilean United Workers' Union, in his opening speech talked about the situation in Latin American countries, saying that in these countries, democratic rights have been suppressed, prisons are full of political prisoners, and terror prevails everywhere.

　　Brazilian Judge Pereira pointed out in his speech that in Latin America, regimes established by imperialist coercion are ruling. He also talked about the infringement of freedom in Brazil. He condemned the pressure exerted by imperialism on Latin American countries, which is leading to the elimination of all freedoms.

　　Conference participants also spoke about the increasing persecution and terror in Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Venezuela, Colombia, Cuba, Peru, Paraguay, and other Latin American countries. Speakers pointed out that the current situation in these countries is inconsistent with the results of the Four Power Heads of Government Meeting. They also pointed out that the struggle of the people of Latin American countries for their rights and freedoms is constantly rising.

　　The conference adopted a letter to the parliaments of American countries, stating that the Latin American Countries' Conference for the Defense of Freedom decided to appeal to the parliaments of Latin American countries, demanding that they pass amnesty laws and laws to immediately release all political prisoners, all those arrested for participating in trade unions, student organizations, and religious organizations, and citizens exiled for these reasons.

　　The conference decided to take various measures to prepare for the convening of the American Countries' Conference for the Defense of Freedom in the middle of 1956.

    巴西法官培列拉在发言中指出，在拉丁美洲，由帝国主义强迫建立的政权正在进行统治。他还谈到巴西的自由遭到侵害的情况。他谴责帝国主义对拉丁美洲国家施加压力，这种压力正在导致一切自由的消灭。

    会议通过告美洲各国议会书说，拉丁美洲国家保卫自由会议决定向拉丁美洲各国议会呼吁，要求它们通过大赦法律，并且通过立即释放所有政治犯，所有因为参加工会、学生组织、宗教组织而遭到逮捕的人，以及为了这些原因而遭到流放的公民的法律。
    会议决定采取各种措施，准备在一九五六年年中召开美洲国家保卫自由大会。
