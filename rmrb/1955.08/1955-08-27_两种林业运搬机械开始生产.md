Two Types of Forestry Transport Machinery Begin Production

　　The Forestry Ministry Vehicle Factory has begun production of two widely used types of forestry transport machinery: the single-drum winch and the double-drum winch.

　　These two types of forestry transport machinery are small in size and powerful, and can replace forestry workers in various timber transport tasks such as loading, stacking, log gathering, and river exiting. The single-drum winch can load two tons of timber bundles from the ground onto trucks at a time. Its workload in eight hours is equivalent to the workload of twenty-two workers in one day. It is also equipped with an internal combustion engine and can travel back and forth on forest railways. The double-drum winch can use steel cables to drag large quantities of timber.

　　These two machines were recently successfully trial-produced by the Forestry Ministry Vehicle Factory. After appraisal and load testing, they have been proven to meet usage requirements.

　　两种林业运搬机械开始生产
    林业部车辆工厂开始生产两种用途广的林业运搬机械——单筒绞盘机和双筒绞盘机。
    这两种林业运搬机械体积小、力量大，可以代替林业工人进行装车、归楞、集材、出河等多种木材运搬工作。单筒绞盘机能一次把两吨木材成捆地从平地装到货车上，它八小时的工作量相当于二十二个工人一天的工作量，它还装有内燃发动机，可以在森林铁路上来回行走。双筒绞盘机能用钢索拖拉大量木材。
    这两种机械是林业部车辆工厂最近试制成功的。经过鉴定和负荷试验，证明合乎使用要求。
