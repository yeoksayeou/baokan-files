Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: Chinese and Albanian artists held a pleasant garden party today at the Summer Palace in the western suburbs of Beijing.

At around 10 a.m., the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble arrived at the Summer Palace, accompanied by artists from the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Beijing. The Albanian artists entered the East Palace Gate and visited the Hall of Benevolence and Longevity, then divided into four groups to visit the newly renovated Hall of Joyful Harmony, appreciated the lotus blossoms in the Xiequ Garden, and climbed the Hall of Scenic Beauty and the Wisdom Sea on Longevity Hill, overlooking the entire Kunming Lake, the Dragon King Temple in the heart of the lake, and the Seventeen-Arch Bridge. Chinese and Albanian artists chatted cordially along the way, exchanging autographs and souvenirs. Songs were heard from the crowd from time to time, and the low singing of a few people often turned into a chorus.

At noon, after resting and having lunch at the Tingli Hall, Chinese and Albanian artists watched a performance of Chinese and Albanian song and dance programs together. The first program was a duet of the Albanian song "Textile Labor Competition" sung by Chinese male soloist Fang Yingxuan and Albanian female soloist Florinda Shala. Afterwards, artists from the Chinese military performed solo songs, Chinese folk and classical dances, acrobatics, and other programs. Albanian artists also performed Albanian songs and folk dances. Albanian dancers Adesayatiq Meturi and Vida Meturi performed the Xinjiang Uyghur "Sabayi Dance" that they had recently learned in China, which was warmly welcomed. During the performance, many citizens visiting the park also gathered on the high ground behind the Tingli Hall to watch the performance.

Afterwards, Chinese and Albanian artists boarded painted boats and small boats at the Qingyanfang, cruising leisurely on Kunming Lake. People sang to their heart's content on the painted boats, accompanied by accordions, and some danced in the painted boats to the music.

The garden party ended at half past four in the afternoon.

　　中阿两国文艺工作者在颐和园游园联欢
    新华社二十六日讯　中国和阿尔巴尼亚的文艺工作者今天在北京西郊的颐和园举行了一次愉快的游园联欢会。
    上午十时许，阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团到达颐和园，由中国人民解放军和北京市的文艺工作者陪同游园。阿尔巴尼亚的艺术家们入东宫门参观了仁寿殿，然后分四路参观了新修的颐乐殿，到谐趣园欣赏了满池绿荷，又登上万寿山的景福阁和智慧海，眺望昆明湖全景和湖心的龙王庙及十七孔桥。中阿两国文艺工作者一路亲切地谈笑，并互相交换签名及纪念品。人群中不时传出了歌声，往往几个人的低声歌唱变成了大合唱。
    中午，中阿两国文艺工作者在听鹂馆休息和进餐后，在一起观看了中阿两国歌舞节目的表演。头一个节目是中国男声独唱者方应暄和阿尔巴尼亚女声独唱者弗洛林达·沙拉合唱的阿尔巴尼亚歌曲“纺织劳动竞赛”歌。接着由中国部队文艺工作者表演了独唱、中国民间舞蹈和古典舞、杂技等节目。阿尔巴尼亚的艺术家也表演了阿尔巴尼亚的歌曲和民间舞蹈，阿尔巴尼亚舞蹈家阿德萨亚蒂克·梅图里和维达·梅图里表演了来中国后新学会的新疆维吾尔族“萨巴依舞”，受到了热烈的欢迎。表演进行时，许多游园的市民也聚集在听鹂馆后山高处围观表演。
    接着，中阿两国的文艺工作者在清宴舫登上画舫和小艇，泛舟漫游昆明湖。人们在画舫上伴和着手风琴尽情地歌唱，有的在画舫中随着乐声歌舞。
    游园联欢会一直到下午四时半结束。
