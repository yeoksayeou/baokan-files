　　Construction in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
　　The Soviet Union builds more new railways every year
　　The railways built by the Soviet Union in the last five years are approximately two and a half times the amount built during the Fourth Five-Year Plan period (1946-1950).
　　New railway lines opened to traffic in the Soviet Union in the last five years include: the Moyinti-Chu line, the Stalinsk-Akmolinsk section of the South Siberian Railway, the Chardzhou-Kungrad line, and many other railway lines that promote the economic development of the Soviet Union in the eastern regions.
　　Currently, many railway lines are still under construction. After the Chardzhou-Kungrad line opened to traffic in July, the line is continuing to be laid from Kungrad to Makat, opening up a new route for the Central Asian republics to reach the central regions. On the South Siberian trunk line, the Abakan-Stalinsk section is under construction, which, when completed, will greatly strengthen the connection between the Kuznetsk coal region and the Urals. The Krasnoyarsk-Yeniseysk line, which is under construction, will play an important role in the development of local logging industry.
　　Approximately one thousand kilometers of new railway lines in the reclaimed areas will soon be open to traffic. The grain harvested from the reclaimed land this year will be transported out in a steady stream not only along highways, but also along railways.
　　The railways in the Ural and Siberian regions are being massively laid with double tracks, and by the end of this year, the length of double-track railways will increase by two thousand kilometers.
　　In terms of railway electrification, the Soviet Union now has electric locomotives running on nineteen railway lines. This year's railway electrification workload will increase by seventy percent compared to last year. Eight hundred and seventy kilometers of particularly busy railway sections have already been electrified. The day when the railway line from Moscow to Lake Baikal is completely electrified is not far away.
　　Every Minute – A New House
　　"Every minute – a new house!" – The Soviet "Literary Gazette" recently published an article with this title, saying that every time the second hand completes a circle, a new house appears in the Soviet countryside. In the nine years since the war, approximately four and a half million minutes have passed, and rural residents in the Soviet Union have gained four and a half million new houses. In addition, during this period, cities have also built new houses with a living area of 200 million square meters. In the years of the First Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union started the construction of new factories, mines, or hydroelectric power stations every day, while now, "more than" two large-scale enterprises are put into production every day. These materials illustrate that the scale and speed of construction work in the Soviet Union are unprecedented.
　　Promoting the use of reinforced concrete components in construction makes high-speed building possible.
　　At the Moscow New Building Technology Exhibition, people can see the achievements of Soviet building technology in these areas. For example, the exhibition showcases a cross-section of a residential building, with walls and roofs assembled from factory-made reinforced concrete components. Gas pipes, drainage pipes, heating pipes, hot water pipes, and cold water pipes are pre-installed on a component. When the house is assembled, sanitary engineers no longer need to drill holes in the walls to install these delivery pipes. There is also something new in building technology - electric wall panels. It's interior has pre-installed electric light lines, telephone lines, television lines, and various electrical wires. It can save a lot of installation work after the house is built.
　　Due to the wide use of prefabricated reinforced concrete components and advanced building technology, many construction companies have greatly improved labor productivity. According to the decision of the Party and the government, the Soviet Union will build 402 factories and 200 construction material plants in 1955-1956 to manufacture reinforced concrete components. Some of these factories and plants have already been put into production, and now, there are 700 such enterprises working across the country.
　　Achievements of Workers in North Korean Light Industry
　　Workers in the light industry sector of North Korea are working hard to fully complete the project of restoring 42 pre-war enterprises and building 11 new modern enterprises. It is expected that by the end of this year, they will be able to fulfill the task stipulated in the Three-Year Plan of increasing the production of consumer goods to twice the pre-war level of 1949 one year ahead of schedule.
　　The Pyongyang Textile Factory, the largest base of the Korean textile industry, is being built into a combined enterprise with various equipment for cotton textile, silk textile, knitting, dyeing, and bleaching. By the end of this year, the factory will have 60,000 spindles and 2,000 looms. Starting from the beginning of next year, it will be able to produce 200,000 meters of cotton cloth per day, doubling the current cotton cloth production. In the first half of this year, the production of cotton fabrics in the northern part of the republic has grown to twice the total production in 1949.
　　In the food industry, the Pyongyang Meat Processing Complex, which can process 2,000 tons of meat per year, is under construction, and the Pyongyang Grain Production Factory, which mainly produces starch, syrup, and alcohol, is also being restored. The expansion and restoration projects of these two factories will be completed by the end of this year, and production will begin at the end of this year and the beginning of next year.
　　Vietnamese Workers Launch Patriotic Competition
　　Workers in various parts of North Vietnam are greeting the upcoming 10th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with achievements in increasing production and practicing economy.
　　On the construction site of the Hanoi-Lao Cai Railway, workers have launched patriotic competitions to welcome the National Day and have achieved results. At Construction Site No. 12, workers saved 6,300 workdays in the patriotic competition. At another construction site, many labor models emerged in the patriotic competition. Among them, rock crusher Chen Youhui crushed nearly five cubic meters of rock every day, reaching 136% of the target; Nguyen Van Jin and Huang Wenzhu blasted more than 27.3% of the target every day.
　　At Construction Site No. 6 of the Hanoi-Nam Dinh Railway restoration project, workers have reviewed their work from March 18 to August 15. During this period, they have completed the restoration of the roadbed, built five stations, and completed 70% of the construction of the other six stations. The entire construction site has exceeded the work by 32,355 workdays, and many labor models have emerged.
　　Workers at the Hanoi Waterworks have also launched patriotic competitions and saved a lot of funds in the competition. Workers at the Hanoi An Phu Power Plant have put forward many rationalization proposals for increasing production.
　　Bulgarian Tractor Stations Busily Carry Out Autumn Plowing
　　Bulgaria's machine tractor stations are busily plowing autumn耕地 land.
　　Some states have completed more than 50% of the plan for plowing autumn耕地 land. In Vratsa State, about 60% of all arable land has been plowed. In Stalin State, the area of land that has been plowed is 475,000 decares (each decare equals one and a half mu). Machine operators plowed 4,000 decares of land in just one day, August 20. In Dobruja, hundreds of tractor drivers are working day and night.

　　苏联和人民民主国家的建设
　  苏联新建铁路一年比一年长
    苏联最近五年来建设的铁路，约为第四个五年计划期间（一九四六—一九五零年）的两倍半。
    苏联在最近五年中通车的新铁路线有：莫英提—楚线、南西伯利亚铁路线的斯大林斯克—阿克摩林斯克段、查尔朱—孔格勒线以及许多其他促进苏联在东部地区经济发展的铁路线。
    目前，还有许多铁路线继续在进行建设。查尔朱—孔格勒线在七月通车后，继续从孔格勒向马卡特铺设，为中亚细亚各共和国打开通向中央地区的新道路。在南西伯利亚干线上，阿巴根—斯大林斯克段正在进行建设，它建成之后，将大大加强库兹涅茨克煤区和乌拉尔的联系。正在建设中的克拉斯诺雅尔斯克—叶尼塞斯克线，对发展当地伐木业将发生重要的作用。
    垦荒地区约有一千公里的新铁路线很快就要通车了。今年从开垦的土地上收获的粮食，不仅将沿着公路，而且将沿着铁路源源运出。
    在乌拉尔和西伯利亚地区的铁路正在大规模铺设双轨，到今年年底为止，双轨铁路的长度将增加两千公里。
    在铁路电气化方面，苏联现在已经有十九条铁路上行驶的列车用电动机车牵引。今年的铁路电气化工作量将比去年增加百分之七十。货运特别繁忙的铁路线段中，已经有八百七十公里的长度电气化。从莫斯科到贝加尔湖之间的铁路线完全电气化的日子已经不远了。
　  每一分钟——一所新住宅
    “每一分钟——一所新住宅！”——苏联“文学报”最近以这样的标题发表文章说：每当秒针走完一圈，苏联农村中就出现一所新住宅。在战后九年来，大约有四百五十万分钟过去了，苏联农村居民已经获得了四百五十万所新住宅。而除此以外，这个时期内，各城市也建成了居住面积达两亿平方公尺的新住宅。在第一个五年计划的年代中，苏联每天都有新的工厂、矿井或者水电站开工，而在现在，每天有两个“以上”大规模的企业投入生产。这些材料说明，苏联建筑工作的规模和速度是空前的。
    在建筑中推广钢筋混凝土构件使高速度建筑房屋成为可能。
    在莫斯科新建筑技术展览会上，人们可以看到苏联建筑技术在这些方面的成就。例如，展览会上展出了一个住宅的断面，它的墙壁和屋顶都是用工厂制出的钢筋混凝土构件装配的。在一块构件上预先就装置着煤气管、排水管、暖气管、热水管和冷水管。当房屋装配成以后，卫生工程人员就不必再在墙壁上凿孔安装这些输送管了。在建筑技术中还有一种新的东西——电壁板。它的内部预先就装有电灯线、电话线、电视线和各种电线。它可以使房屋建成后省去许多安装工作。
    由于广泛地使用装配式钢筋混凝土构件和先进的建筑技术，许多建筑企业已经大大提高了劳动生产率。根据党和政府的决议，一九五五—一九五六年苏联要建筑四百零二个工厂和二百个工地建筑材料工场，以制造钢筋混凝土构件。这些工厂和工场有一部分已经投入生产了，现在，全国已经有七百个这样的企业在工作着。
  　朝鲜轻工业部门职工的成就
    朝鲜轻工业部门的职工们正为了全部完成恢复战前的四十二个企业和新建十一个现代化企业的工程而努力。预计他们在今年年底就可以提前一年完成三年计划中所规定的把消费品产量增加到战前一九四九年的二倍的任务。
    朝鲜纺织工业的最大的基地平壤纺织工厂正建设成为具有棉纺织、丝纺织、针织、染色和漂白等各种设备的联合企业。这个工厂到今年年底将拥有六万个纱锭和两千台织布机的设备，从明年初开始每天能够生产二十万公尺棉布，比目前的棉布产量增加一倍。今年上半年共和国北部棉织品的产量已增长到一九四九年全年产量的二倍。
    食品工业中一年能加工两千吨肉类的平壤肉类综合工厂正在兴建，以淀粉、糖稀、酒精为主要产品的平壤谷产工厂也正在恢复，这两个工厂扩建和恢复的工程都将在今年年底完工，在今年底和明年初开始生产。
  　越南工人展开爱国竞赛
    越南北方各地工人以增产节约的成绩来迎接即将到来的越南民主共和国建国十周年纪念日。
    在修复河内—老街铁路的工地上，工人们为了迎接国庆节，纷纷展开爱国竞赛，并且取得了成绩。在第十二号工地上，工人们在爱国竞赛中节省了六千三百个工作日。在另一个工地上，在爱国竞赛中涌现了许多劳动模范。其中碎石工人陈友会每天碎石近五立方公尺，达到指标百分之一百三十六；阮文锦和黄文祝每天爆破的石头都超过指标百分之二十七点三。
    在修复河内—南定铁路的第六号工地上，工人们已经检查了他们从三月十八日到八月十五日之间的工作。在这一期间，他们已经完成了路基的修复工程，并且还建成了五个车站，对其他六个车站的修建工程也完成了百分之七十。整个工地已经超额工作了三万二千三百五十五个工作日，并且出现了许多劳动模范。
    河内自来水厂的工人们也展开了爱国竞赛，并且在竞赛中节约了大量资金。河内安埠发电厂的工人们已经提出了许多增产的合理化建议。
  　保拖拉机站紧张进行秋耕
    保加利亚的机器拖拉机站正在紧张地进行翻耕秋耕地的工作。
    有些州已完成翻耕秋耕地的计划百分之五十以上。在弗拉查州已翻耕了全部耕地约百分之六十。在斯大林州已经翻耕的田地面积有四十七万五千狄卡尔（每狄卡尔合一市亩半）。机械操使者仅仅在八月二十日一天中就翻耕了四千狄卡尔的土地。在多布鲁查，数百名拖拉机手正在夜以继日地工作。
