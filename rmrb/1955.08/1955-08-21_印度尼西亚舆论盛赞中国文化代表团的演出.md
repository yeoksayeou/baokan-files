The Chinese Cultural Delegation held its final performance in Indonesia in Jakarta on the evening of August 12th. For a month and a half, the delegation visited the three main islands of Java, Sumatra, and Bali in Indonesia, and held eighteen performances in seven cities including Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Surabaya, Pematangsiantar, Balige, Medan, and Bukittinggi, with an audience of approximately 350,000 people. Every place the delegation visited, local newspapers prominently featured the enthusiastic welcome from all sectors of society and published editorials or articles praising the beautiful Peking Opera, dance, and music programs performed by the Chinese artists. As President Sukarno pointed out, the performances of the Chinese Cultural Delegation have moved the entire Indonesia, and all Indonesian people are willing to be friendly with China.

The comments published in various newspapers showed great interest and sincere admiration for Peking Opera, which has a long historical tradition in China, and the superb skills of the Peking Opera actors.

The Jakarta "Sunday Courier" weekly published an article saying that Chinese Peking Opera has a long history, and this art has developed through the ages. Today, with the cultivation of the government of the People's Republic of China and the help of art organizations, it has achieved even more brilliant development than ever before.

The Jakarta "Wan Xiang" bi-weekly published an article by the famous Indonesian writer Situmorang entitled "Peking Opera - First-Class Stage Art," saying that Peking Opera most prominently represents the high level of Chinese stage art. The article said that Peking Opera "can elevate the intended action to a refined degree, using the least but most precise and obvious movements to express as much content as possible." Peking Opera actors are not only singers and dancers, but also outstanding acrobatic performers. In Peking Opera performances, drama, dance, and acrobatics are intricately intertwined.

The Jakarta "People's Daily" published an article by the famous Indonesian painter Sujono commenting on Peking Opera. The painter enthusiastically praised the actors who played the Monkey King and Yu Ji. Speaking of the Peking Opera "Stealing the Immortal Herb," he said: Audiences only see fast melodies and people moving on the ground. Spears fly in the air. Everything is coordinated with the sound of gongs and drums, jumping up and down, all with a certain rhythm. All the movements, big and small, are very fast and appropriate, not too much, not too little, just right, very artistic, and very magical. People marvel at the physical strength of these male and female actors in controlling their movements in a very short period of time. This is technique, the manifestation of human ability. They are true artists.

The Medan "Patriot Daily" published a commentary saying that after watching the performance of the Chinese Cultural Delegation, we will have such a strong belief: China is now actively carrying out the work of introducing new ideas and refining and processing them in the field of art. The article said: "Peking Opera is full of healthy humor, that is, humor that truly has human touch and noble sentiments. This humor is subtle and can only be appreciated with full attention. Once you appreciate it, you can't help but laugh. Sometimes this humor also turns into a witty remark that makes people laugh, but this kind of wit never makes people feel disgusted."

The Chinese folk music played by the Chinese Cultural Delegation was also enthusiastically praised by the Indonesian people who love music. They especially admired the new prospects of this long-standing music with rich Chinese national style after creative reorganization since the founding of New China.

Suharnoto, director of the Indonesian People's Cultural Association and Indonesian representative who attended the 9th "Prague Spring" International Music Festival, published an article in the newspaper saying that art can only have the opportunity to develop widely in an environment of national independence. He praised "Spring River Flower Moon Night" played with Chinese instruments, saying that the performance used purely Chinese-style instruments, and the main theme of the music was based on the cadence of Chinese melodies, but the entire movement can be said to have the nature of a symphony. The music demonstrates the outstanding talent of the creator and the skillful technique of the performer. The article said that this piece of music takes the audience to the beautiful realm of a clear sky and moonlight night, and describes the turbulent but calm spring river water, which contains great potential. The article said that this is a masterpiece of realist artists.

The Surabaya "Mass Daily" praised the Pipa solo "Ambush from All Sides" as a poem-like and beautiful piece of music, and praised the Chinese instrumental ensemble "Flowing Stream" as a song "full of bold and bright melodies."

"Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix" played with the Chinese folk instrument Suona was also universally praised.

The Indonesian people also love the Chinese dances with strong ethnic colors performed by Chinese artists. The Jakarta "People's Daily" published an article praising "Lotus Dance" saying: The waving of the dancers' hands is like waves hitting the shore, undulating rhythmically according to the laws of nature. Their smiles dispel the haze in life and eliminate the depressed mood. The author said: "I seem reluctant to blink my eyes, and I want to watch this beautiful world non-stop." This article also praised Dai Ailian's performance of "Grandmother Carrying Grandson," believing that although the performance of this dance is very difficult, the performance results are very good.

The Jakarta "Independent Newspaper" praised the Xinjiang "Plate Dance" saying that this dance "shows how the people in that land inhabited by many Muslims warmly welcome the arrival of the Chinese People's Liberation Army."

The Medan "Promoter Daily" also published comments praising "Tea Picking and Butterfly Catching Dance" and "Lion Dance."

　　印度尼西亚舆论盛赞中国文化代表团的演出
　　新华社驻雅加达记者　钱行
    中国文化代表团八月十二日晚上在雅加达举行了在印度尼西亚的最后一次演出。一个半月以来，代表团访问了印度尼西亚的爪哇、苏门答腊和峇里三个主要岛屿，并且先后在雅加达、日惹、泗水、峇塘、峇里陵、棉兰和武吉丁宜等七个城市举行了十八次演出，观众约在三十五万人以上。代表团每到一个地方，当地报纸都以显著地位刊载各界人士热烈欢迎代表团的盛况，并且发表社论或者文章盛赞中国艺术家表演的优美的京剧、舞蹈和音乐节目。正像苏加诺总统所指出的：中国文化代表团的演出已经震动了整个印度尼西亚，全印度尼西亚人民都愿意同中国友好。
    各地报纸上发表的评论对于中国具有悠久历史传统的京剧和京剧演员的精湛演技特别感到巨大的兴趣并且表示衷心的赞佩。
    雅加达“星期日信使”周刊发表文章说，中国京剧具有悠久的历史，这种艺术历代已经有过发展，今天在中华人民共和国政府的培养和艺术组织的帮助之下，它得到了比以往更加光辉的发展。
    雅加达“万象”旬刊发表印度尼西亚著名作家西图莫兰的题为“京剧——第一流的舞台艺术”的文章说，京剧最突出地表示了中国舞台艺术的高度水平。文章说，京剧“能够把意图中的动作提升到精炼的程度，用最少的但是最精确最明显的动作来表现尽量多的内容”。京剧的演员既是歌唱家和舞蹈家，同时又是卓越的杂技表演者。在京剧演出中，戏剧、舞蹈和杂技错综交织在一起了。
    雅加达“人民日报”刊载了印度尼西亚著名画家苏佐诺评论京剧的文章。画家热烈赞扬扮演猴王和虞姬的演员。他在谈到京剧“盗仙草”时说：观众只看到快速的旋律，只见地面上人们在走动。长枪在空中飞舞。一切都配合锣鼓声，跳起来，倒下去，都有一定的节拍。一切大大小小的动作都非常快速恰当，不太多不太少，恰到好处，非常艺术，非常神奇。人们为这些男女演员能在非常短促的时间内控制自己的动作的体力而赞叹，这是技术，是人的能力的表现。他们是真正的艺术家。
    棉兰“爱国者报”发表评论说，在看了中国文化代表团的演出之后，我们就会产生这样强烈的信念：中国现在在艺术方面正在积极进行推陈出新和加工精炼的工作。文章说：“京剧充满了健康的幽默，即真正有着人情味和高尚情操的幽默。这种幽默是细致的，只有充分地注意才能体会到，体会到以后就不能不发笑。有时这种幽默也变为一种诙谐，使人为之捧腹大笑，然而这种诙谐从来不使人生厌。”
    中国文化代表团演奏的中国民族音乐，也同样受到爱好音乐的印度尼西亚人民的热烈赞赏。他们特别对于这种历史悠久的富有中国民族风格的音乐，在新中国成立以来经过创造性的整理后所具有的新的前景，表示赞佩。
    印度尼西亚人民文化协会理事、出席过第九届“布拉格之春”国际音乐节的印度尼西亚代表苏哈尔诺多在报纸上发表文章说，只有在国家独立的环境里艺术才能得到广泛发展的机会。他赞扬中国乐器演奏的“春江花月夜”说，演奏用的是一些纯粹中国风格的乐器，乐曲主调是根据抑扬顿挫的中国式旋律的，但是整个乐章却可说是具有交响乐的性质。乐曲表现出创作者的杰出才能和演奏者的技术的熟练。文章说，这支乐曲把听众带到天空明朗、月光普照的夜晚的美丽境界里去，并且描述了湍急的、但是却平静地蕴含着伟大潜力的春天的江水。文章说，这是现实主义艺术家的杰作。
    泗水“大众日报”赞扬琵琶独奏“十面埋伏”是一支像诗一样优美的乐曲，并且称赞中国乐器合奏“流水操”一曲“充满着豪放豁朗的旋律”。
    用中国民间乐器唢呐演奏的“百鸟朝凤”也受到普遍的赞赏。
    印度尼西亚人民也喜爱中国艺术家表演的有浓厚民族色彩的中国舞蹈。雅加达“人民日报”发表文章推崇“荷花舞”说：舞蹈者的手的摆动像波涛打在岸边激起浪花，有规律地、依照着自然的规律起伏波动。她们的微笑驱散了生活中的阴霾，消除了忧闷的心情。作者说：“我好像是不愿眨一眨眼睛，要一刻不停地注视着这个美丽的世界”。这篇文章也赞赏戴爱莲表演的“祖背孙”，认为尽管这个舞蹈的表演十分困难，但是表演的成绩非常好。
    雅加达“独立报”盛赞新疆“盘子舞”说，这个舞蹈“表现了那一块住着许多伊斯兰教徒的土地上，人民是怎样热烈地欢迎着中国人民解放军的到来。”
    棉兰“推动者日报”也曾发表评论赞赏“采茶扑蝶舞”和“狮舞”。
