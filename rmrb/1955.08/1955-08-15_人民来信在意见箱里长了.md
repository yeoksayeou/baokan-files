    People's Letters Grew Mold in the Suggestion Box
    To the Editor:
    Next to the public notice board of the People's Court in Yudu County, Jiangxi Province, there is a suggestion box. Although this suggestion box has an iron lock, the small door can actually be opened with just a push of a finger – the suggestion box has long been decayed.
    Recently, this decayed suggestion box was opened. People found more than ten people's letters inside. These letters were all moldy, and some even grew white mold. If you carefully identify the handwriting on these letters, you can see that two of them were dropped in in 1951 and have been in the suggestion box for more than four years. The content of many people's letters is very important: some expose counter-revolutionary elements, some expose illegal merchants engaged in speculation and profiteering, some expose state organ staff members for violating laws and regulations…
    The purpose of setting up a suggestion box is to listen to the opinions of the masses of people and improve work. However, this suggestion box in Yudu County has become a place to confine people's letters, which is intolerable. The Yudu County People's Committee should find out which unit set up this suggestion box and severely criticize this unit for its error of not paying attention to the people's opinions.

### 人民来信在意见箱里长了

    人民来信在意见箱里长了霉编辑同志：
    江西省雩都县城内人民法院公示牌的旁边有着一个意见箱。这个意见箱虽然挂着一把铁锁，实际只要用手指一顶就可以把小门打开——原来这个意见箱早已经腐朽了。
    最近，这个腐朽的意见箱被打开了。人们发现里面有十多件人民来信。这些来信已经全部霉烂了，有的还长了白霉。如果仔细辨认这些来信的字迹，还可以看出其中有两件是一九五一年投进去的，在意见箱里已经四年多了。不少人民来信的内容都很重要：有检举反革命分子的，有揭发不法商人投机倒把的，有揭发国家机关工作人员违法乱纪行为的……。
    设置意见箱的目的，是倾听人民群众的意见，来改进工作。但是，像雩都县的这个意见箱，反而成了禁闭人民来信的地方，这是令人不能容忍的。雩都县人民委员会应该查明这个意见箱是那个单位设置的，并对这个单位不重视人民意见的错误提出严厉的批评。
