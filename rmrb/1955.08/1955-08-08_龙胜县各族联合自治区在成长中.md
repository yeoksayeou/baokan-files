Longsheng County in Guangxi Province is a remote area with vast territory, overlapping mountains, sparse population, and a backward economy. People of Zhuang, Dong, Miao, Yao, Li, and Han nationalities live here. During the reigns of successive reactionary rulers, the people here lived an exceptionally hard life. The saying "Furong has good fields but no rice to sell, Weijiang has beautiful girls but no blankets to cover them, Aotou eats light dishes with tea oil" has been passed down through history.

As early as the fifth year of the Qianlong reign in the Qing Dynasty, the people of all ethnic groups in Longsheng, unable to endure the oppression and plunder of the feudal dynasty, united to stage an uprising that was large in scale and lasted for three years. In 1933, the people of all ethnic groups in Longsheng raised the red flag again to oppose the tyrannical rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, organizing a force of more than 60,000 people with strong fighting spirit. Although they were later severely suppressed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the flames of anger continued to burn in the hearts of the people of all ethnic groups.

Dark clouds cannot block the sun. In 1934, the Red Army passed through the northern part of Longsheng, sowing the seeds of revolution here. During the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation, the people of all ethnic groups in Longsheng organized their own guerrilla forces and persisted in the struggle behind enemy lines. In April 1949, the people of all ethnic groups in Longsheng were finally liberated from their years of suffering. After more than two years of preparation, the Longsheng County United Autonomous Region of Various Nationalities was established in August 1951. The brilliance of the Communist Party's ethnic policy shines on the people of all ethnic groups in Longsheng, guiding them to rebuild their homes and move towards a prosperous new life.

In order to promote the economy of minority nationalities, the state has vigorously supported the minority nationalities here in production and improved their lives. Up to the first half of 1954, the people of all ethnic groups in Longsheng had received more than 250,000 yuan in production subsidies, more than 410,000 yuan in relief funds, and 370,000 yuan in agricultural loans.

From the process of developing production, the people of all ethnic groups in Longsheng have increasingly realized that only by following the Communist Party and taking the road of mutual aid and cooperation can they get rid of poverty and achieve common prosperity. Therefore, an agricultural production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation has been launched among the people of all ethnic groups. In 1953, the number of year-round mutual aid teams had grown to 90, and seasonal mutual aid teams had grown to 570, accounting for 16.9 percent of the total number of farming households, laying a certain foundation for the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives. To date, 82 agricultural production cooperatives (including one forestry cooperative) have been established in the county, with a total of 1,508 households, accounting for 6.9 percent of the county's farming households, and more than 7,900 mu of land joining the cooperatives, accounting for a little over 6.7 percent of the county's total land area. These 82 agricultural cooperatives are either single-ethnic or multi-ethnic, and are distributed in 41 villages in six districts. The organized peasants have greatly increased their enthusiasm for production, and their production techniques have also been continuously improved. Some have advanced plowing, fertilizing, and sowing ahead of schedule according to the season, and the more common practices are to promote close planting with small seedlings, salt water seed selection, rational fertilization, changing one season to multiple seasons, and three plows and three harrows and other new cultivation methods. Due to the continuous improvement and enhancement of cultivation methods, production has increased year by year. For example, a plot of land belonging to Shi Wanxing, a member of the Luoxingjin Agricultural Cooperative, could only yield 50 handfuls of rice before liberation, 80 handfuls in 1952, and 50 more handfuls in 1953 than in 1952, more than double the yield before liberation. Long Xingyu, the head of Furong Township, increased the production of his ten-dan paddy field by 85 percent in 1954 compared to 1953. The Zhou Changyuan Mutual Aid Team in the Sixth District (now reorganized into a cooperative) increased its production by 26 percent in 1954 compared to 1953. They composed a folk song saying: "Furong is a good field, rice used not to leave the village; last year's close planting increased production, many families sold surplus grain." Due to the promotion of winter planting, they also gained successful experience in trial planting of wheat, which opened up a new era of wheat planting in the history of Longsheng.

In order to fight against natural disasters, the people of all ethnic groups have actively built water conservancy projects and gradually eliminated the habit of praying to gods for rain. In the past, insect pests were considered to be "given by heaven and taken by heaven," but now this is not the case. When a serious disaster of floating insects, rice case worms, and leaf rollers was discovered in Pingdeng Township in the Fourth District on July 4, 1954, the people, under the leadership of the government, put forward the slogan "Catch and eliminate insect pests, catch them small, catch them early, catch them all." After three days of effort, the insect pests were basically eliminated. They also organized hunting teams to protect the safety of people and livestock and the harvest of crops.

Due to the organized and led production, not only were disasters overcome, but also consecutive years of increased production were achieved, and the lives of the people of all ethnic groups have been significantly improved. In the Shuanghe Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shuanghe Township, First District, out of 19 households, only 4 households had enough grain to eat before liberation, and 15 households did not have enough. After organizing mutual aid teams in 1953, 9 households had enough grain to eat (and sold 6,000 jin of surplus grain), and 10 households did not have enough. In 1954, after the mutual aid teams were transformed into agricultural cooperatives, 18 households sold 15,000 jin of surplus grain, and only 1 household did not have enough. The cooperative's grain production increased year by year, increasing by 30 percent in 1953 compared to 1952, and by 7 percent in 1954 compared to 1953. Before liberation, only one middle peasant household could afford to slaughter pigs for the New Year, but in 1954, 18 households could slaughter pigs (one pig per household), and 13 of them sold 13 pigs. The lives of other households have also improved.

Due to the gradual improvement of economic life, the people's demand for culture has also become increasingly urgent. In recent years, the government has allocated a total of 121,438 yuan in educational subsidies, built 65 school buildings, subsidized 57 primary schools, provided textbooks and stationery subsidies for 5,000 students, and provided scholarships for more than 300 students. In 1954 alone, out of 8,789 students in the county, 2,665 received textbook and stationery subsidies, 89 received scholarships, and 494 received new cotton-padded clothes, which encouraged learning and greatly promoted the development of cultural and educational undertakings for minority nationalities.

Before liberation, there were only 116 primary schools in the county, with 4,500 students. Now, the number of primary schools has increased to 172, with 8,789 students. There is one middle school, with 261 students, compared to only 68 students in the first semester of 1950. In addition, there are 57 students studying at the Central University for Nationalities, the South-Central University for Nationalities, the Provincial University for Nationalities, and ordinary colleges and universities, which is a new phenomenon that has never occurred in the history of Longsheng. In order to further encourage the people's enthusiasm for learning, reduce illiteracy, eliminate ignorance, and promote science, the government opened 245 winter schools in the second half of 1954, with a total of 6,000 students, and 120 year-round people's schools, with 1,900 students. Those who participate in learning are constantly making progress. For example, Huang Yihui, the deputy head of Dayun Township, can now write simple reports after half a year of study. Some old women in Guangnan Township also wear glasses to attend night school. They have not only improved their cultural knowledge but also their political awareness, which has promoted production. They regard labor as a glorious undertaking. Superstitious ideas are gradually decreasing. The number of people who care about national affairs is increasing.

The government pays special attention to ensuring the health of the people of all ethnic groups, and the average annual expenditure on cultural, educational, and health undertakings accounts for more than 29 percent of the county's total budget. In addition to expanding the county hospital, health centers have also been established in each district. In addition, two maternal and child health stations have been established. The equipment in medical instruments has also gradually increased. The number of health personnel has increased 17 times compared to before liberation.

In order to facilitate the people of all ethnic groups to receive medical treatment, the county hospital often organizes mobile medical teams to go to remote areas without convenient transportation and medical care to treat minority nationalities. In 1953, the central government also specially sent medical experts to investigate and study filariasis, which was previously considered untreatable, and the province also sent medical teams to treat it. Patients with filariasis, which had been untreatable for decades, received treatment. The incidence of malaria, scabies, dysentery, typhoid fever, and other infectious diseases has been greatly reduced. For example, before the launch of the patriotic health campaign in Qidong Village, the number of people suffering from malaria accounted for 50 percent, but after the launch of the patriotic health campaign, not a single person suffered from malaria in 1953. Smallpox has been basically eliminated. The health of the people has also greatly improved. The infant mortality rate has also gradually decreased. Fewer and fewer people are resigning themselves to fate and seeking medical treatment from gods.

The people of all ethnic groups in Longsheng have deeply realized from actual struggles that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government can they eliminate exploitation and poverty and build a prosperous and happy socialist society. They say: "In the past, the peasants were so poor that they ate Mao Dou (wild plants) without oil or salt. After liberation, they were given land and fields, and the Communist Party turned bitterness into sweetness." Therefore, more and more people are asking to join the Communist Party. According to statistics in April 1955, there are a total of 48 Party branches and 478 Party members in the county, of which minority nationality Party members account for 70.18 percent.

The Party branch plays a core and fortress role in implementing the Party's policies, enhancing ethnic unity, carrying out mutual aid and cooperation movements, and various central tasks, and has strengthened the relationship between the Party and the masses of the people of all ethnic groups. There are five ethnic groups in Huachiao Township, Sixth District: Han, Zhuang, Yao, Miao, and Dong. In the past, the estrangement between the various ethnic groups was very deep. After the establishment of the Party branch, it correctly implemented the ethnic policy, improved ethnic relations, and enhanced ethnic unity. During the drought, all ethnic groups promoted the spirit of friendship and mutual assistance. They also automatically organized a drought-fighting team of more than 50 people to help Yaohuai Village fight the drought, repaired two canals, and carried water by manpower to save the rice crops in more than 40 villages. Party members are able to lead by example, overcome difficulties, unite the masses, and become the force driving the people of all ethnic groups in Longsheng forward.

    龙胜县各族联合自治区在成长中
    赵卓云
    广西龙胜县是一个幅员辽阔，大山重叠，人口稀少，经济落后的偏僻地区。这里居住着僮、侗、苗、瑶、黎、汉等几个民族的人民。在历代反动统治的时期，这里的人民过着异常艰苦的生活。历史上流传着“芙蓉好田庄无米卖，伟江好姑娘无被盖，坳头打油茶吃淡菜”的俗语。
    远在满清乾隆五年，龙胜各族人民由于忍受不了封建王朝的压迫和掠夺，便团结起来，举行暴动，规模很大，持续了三年之久。一九三三年，龙胜各族人民又举起红旗，反对蒋介石匪帮的暴政统治，组织起来的队伍有六万多人，斗志十分坚强。后来虽然遭到蒋介石匪帮的严厉镇压，但愤怒的火焰一直在各族人民的心中燃烧着。
    乌云遮不了太阳。一九三四年，红军长征经过龙胜北部地区，在这里播下了革命的种子。抗日战争和解放战争中，龙胜各族人民组织了自己的游击队伍，坚持了敌后的斗争。一九四九年四月，龙胜各族人民终于从苦难的岁月里解放出来了。经过两年多时间的酝酿和准备，于一九五一年八月，成立了龙胜县各族联合自治区。共产党的民族政策的光辉照耀着龙胜各族人民，引导着他们重新建设自己的家园，走向富裕繁荣的新生活。
    国家为了繁荣少数民族的经济，曾经大力扶助这里的少数民族人民进行生产，改善生活。至一九五四年上半年止，龙胜各族人民得到了生产补助费二十五万多元，救济费四十一万多元，农贷三十七万元。
    从发展生产的过程中，龙胜各族人民愈来愈深刻地认识到只有跟着共产党走互助合作的道路，才能摆脱贫困，共同富裕。因此，以互助合作为中心的农业生产运动在各族人民中间展开了。一九五三年时，常年互助组已发展到九十个，季节互助组发展到五百七十个，占总农户的百分之十六点九，为建立农业生产合作社打下了一定的基础。到目前止，全县已建立了八十二个农业生产合作社（其中有一个是林业社），共一千五百零八户，占全县农户的百分之六点九，入社田七千九百多亩，占全县总田亩的百分之六点七强。这八十二个农业社有的是单民族，有的是多民族共同建立，分布在六个区四十
  一个乡。组织起来的农民，生产积极性大大提高了，生产技术也不断地改进。有的按季节提前翻土、施肥、播种，较普遍的是推行了小株密植，盐水选种，合理施肥，一季变多季，三犁三耙等新的耕作方法。由于耕作方法的不断改善和提高，生产一年比一年增长了。如罗兴锦农业社社员石万兴的一丘田，解放前一般的只能收到五十把禾，一九五二年收到八十把，一九五三年又比一九五二年增加了五十把，比解放前增加一倍多。芙蓉乡乡长龙兴玉的十担谷田，一九五四年比一九五三年增产百分之八十五。六区周昌元互助组（现已改社），一九五四年比一九五三年增产百分之二十六。他们编出一首山歌说：“芙蓉好田庄，从前谷米不出乡；去年密植增了产，几多人家卖余粮。”由于提倡冬种，也取得了试种小麦的成功经验，这就在龙胜的历史上开辟了种植小麦的新纪元。
    为了同自然灾害作斗争，各族人民积极地兴修了水利，逐渐扫除了求神祈雨的习惯。过去认为虫灾是“天放天收”，现在不然了，一九五四年七月四区平等乡发现浮漂虫、稻包虫、卷叶虫的严重灾情时，人民在政府的领导下，提出“捕灭虫灾、捉小、捉早、捉了”的口号，经过三天的努力，基本上扑灭了虫害。他们还组织了打猎队，保人畜的安全和农作物的丰收。
    由于有组织有领导的进行生产，不仅战胜了灾荒，而且取得了连年增产的成绩，各族人民的生活有了显著的提高。一区双河乡双河农业生产合作社，十九户，解放前粮食够吃的仅有四户，不够吃的有十五户，一九五三年组织互助组后，粮食够吃的有九户（并卖出余粮六千斤），不够吃的有十户。一九五四年由互助组转农业社后，便有十八户卖出余粮一万五千斤，只有一户不够吃，该社的粮食生产是逐年增加的，一九五三年比一九五二年增产百分之三十，一九五四年比一九五三年增产百分之七。解放前能杀猪过年的仅有一户中农，到一九五四年过年时能杀猪的便有十八户（每户杀一只），其中还有十三户卖出十三只猪。其他各户的生活，也有改善。
    由于经济生活的逐渐改善，人民对于文化的要求也日益迫切了。几年来，政府前后拨出教育补助费十二万一千四百三十八元，修建了六十五所校舍，补助了五十七所小学，有五千个学生得到课本文具的补助，三百多个学生领到助学金。仅一九五四年一年全县八千七百八十九个学生中，得到课本文具补助的就有二千六百六十五人，领到助学金的有八十九人，领到新棉衣的有四百九十四人，鼓励了学习情绪，大大地推动了少数民族文化教育事业的发展。
    解放前，全县仅有一百一十六所小学，学生四千五百人。现在小学已发展到一百七十二所，学生八千七百八十九人。中学一所，现有学生二百六十一人，而在一九五○年上学期时只有六十八人。此外，还有在中央民族学院、中南民族学院、省民族学院和普通大专学校学习的共五十七人，这是龙胜历史上未曾有过的新气象。政府为了进一步鼓励人民的学习情绪，减少文盲，消灭愚钝，提倡科学，在一九五四年下半年开办了二百四十五班冬学，共有学员六千人，常年民校一百二十班，学员一千九百人。参加学习的人，都在不断的进步。如大云乡副乡长黄义辉经过半年的学习，现在已能写简单的报告了。广南乡有些老太婆戴着眼镜也去夜校学习。他们不仅提高了文化，也提高了政治觉悟，推动了生产。他们把劳动看成是光荣的事业。迷信的思想逐渐减少着。关心国家大事的人增多起来了。
    政府特别注意保障各族人民的健康，每年文教卫生事业费平均占全县总预算的百分之二十九以上。除扩建了县卫生院外，各个区也都建立了卫生所。另外还设了两所妇幼保健站。在医药器械方面的设备，也逐渐地增多了。卫生人员比解放前增加了十七倍。
    为了照顾各族人民医疗疾病的方便，县卫生院时常组织巡回医疗组深入到交通不方便及无医药的地区去为少数民族治疗。一九五三年中央还特派了医学专家来调查研究过去认为无法治疗的血丝虫病，省里也随着派医疗组来治疗。几十年无法治疗的血丝虫病患者，得到了医治。疟疾、疥疮、痢疾、伤寒等流行病，大大地减少了。如其洞屯在未开展爱国卫生运动以前，患疟疾的人数占百分之五十，开展爱国卫生运动以后，在一九五三年便没有一个患疟疾的。天花基本上消灭了。人民的健康情况也有了很大的改善。婴儿死亡率也逐步降低了。听天由命和求神治病的人也愈来愈少了。
    龙胜的各族人民从实际斗争中深刻的体会到：只有在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，才能够消灭剥削和贫困，建设繁荣幸福的社会主义社会，他们说：“从前农民好可怜，猫蔸（野生植物）当饭无油盐，解放分得田和地，共产党来苦变甜。”因此，要求参加共产党的人愈来愈多了。根据一九五五年四月份的统计，全县共有四十八个党的支部，四百七十八个党员，其中少数民族党员占了百分之七十点一八。
    党支部对于贯彻党的政策，增进民族团结，开展互助合作运动以及各项中心工作起了核心堡垒作用，密切了党与各族人民群众间的关系。六区花桥乡有汉、僮、瑶、苗、侗五个民族，过去各民族之间的隔阂很深，党支部建立后，正确地贯彻了民族政策，改善了民族关系，增进了民族团结。在抗旱的时候，各民族都发扬了友爱互助的精神。他们还自动地组织了一个五十多人的抗旱队去帮助腰怀屯抗旱，修好了两条水渠，用人力挑水救活了四十多屯田的禾稻。党员们都能够以身作则，克服困难，团结群众，成为带动龙胜各族人民前进的力量。
