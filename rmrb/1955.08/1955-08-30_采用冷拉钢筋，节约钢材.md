　　Using Cold-Drawn Steel Bars to Save Steel
　　Fan Jun
    The Materials Testing Institute of the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering recently conducted cold drawing tests on steel bars under 10 mm. The test results show that the strength of steel bars can be increased by 20% to 50% after cold working, and the length can be increased by 8%. According to preliminary calculations, the use of cold-drawn steel bars can save about 10% to 25% of steel consumption, while the plasticity of the steel bars remains good. Using cold-drawn steel bars can reduce the size of reinforced concrete components, which can also save the amount of cement and other aggregates used. After the steel bars are cold-drawn, the rust on the surface falls off automatically, and the steel bars can be closely combined with the concrete, which also ensures the quality of the project. In addition, since the elongation of the steel bar after cold drawing has a certain proportion to the cold drawing force, the elongation rate of the steel bar after cold drawing can be calculated in advance, and then the iron breaking work can be carried out to avoid waste.
    The use of cold-drawn steel bars does not require complicated equipment and is relatively easy to operate. A general construction site can use a winch, equipped with a wooden frame with pulleys and a steel bar clamp, to carry out the operation.

　　采用冷拉钢筋，节约钢材
　　范俊
    建筑工程部西北工程管理总局材料试验所最近对十公厘以下的钢筋进行了冷拉试验。试验结果证明：钢筋经过冷加工后，强度可以提高百分之二十至百分之五十，长度可以增加百分之八。据初步计算：使用冷拉钢筋可节省钢筋用量百分之十至百分之二十五左右，而钢筋的塑性仍然良好。使用冷拉钢筋，可以减少钢筋混凝土构件的尺寸，从而也可以节约水泥和其他骨料的使用数量。钢筋经冷拉后，表面的铁锈自行脱落，钢筋同混凝土容易密切结合，也保证了工程的质量。另外，由于冷拉后钢筋的伸长同冷拉力有一定的比例，可以事先计算冷拉后钢筋的伸长率，然后进行断铁工作，以避免浪费。
    采用冷拉钢筋，在设备上并不复杂，操作也较简便，一般的工地上利用卷扬机，再配制一个装有滑轮的木架和夹钢筋器，就可以进行操作。
