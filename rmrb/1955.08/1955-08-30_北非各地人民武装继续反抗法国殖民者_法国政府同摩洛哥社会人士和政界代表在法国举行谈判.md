Xinhua News Agency, August 29th. Throughout North Africa, under the rule of the French colonial authorities, the people's struggle against French atrocities continues to develop. On August 27th, Tunisian guerrillas attacked the French Foreign Legion stationed in Tunisia near Bou Ramli, 20 miles from the Algerian border. According to French military authorities, guerrillas killed 11 and wounded 11 French soldiers in the fierce battle. United Press reporter Hudson pointed out that this battle was "the worst" in months since France signed the so-called "autonomy agreement" with Tunisia.

The situation in Morocco, where French colonial troops have been carrying out suppression operations for days, remains very tense. Fearing new demonstrations against French colonial rule might erupt in Moroccan cities, the French authorities dispatched reinforcements to Casablanca, Rabat, Fez, and other cities on August 28th. In these cities, French military police intensified patrols in Moroccan residential areas in armored vehicles.

According to foreign news agencies, in the past day or two, Moroccan patriots have continued to carry out activities against French colonialists everywhere in Casablanca, Marrakech, Mazagan, Bou Chilon, and other places.

In the Constantine province of Algeria, three fierce battles between Algerian guerrillas and French troops occurred on August 28th. At the same time, the French army continues to reinforce Algeria. According to Reuters, the French government has notified U.S. General Gruenther, the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces, to transfer six battalions of troops from the French forces stationed in West Germany to Algeria.

Xinhua News Agency, August 29th. TASS, Paris, August 27th: The French-Moroccan negotiations held in Aix-les-Bains, France, on August 22nd have ended. The French government delegation, led by French Prime Minister Edgar Faure, participated in the negotiations, consulting with Moroccan social figures and political representatives. The Moroccan side participating in the negotiations included representatives of the Sultan's authorities such as the Prime Minister, some generals, and responsible persons of various cities, as well as representatives of the nationalist parties "Istiqlal Party" and "Democratic Independence Party," representatives of French residents in Morocco, and members of the Republican Senate elected in Morocco.

As can be seen from the news in Parisian newspapers, the negotiations in Aix-les-Bains were very tense. This tense situation was caused by the turbulent situation and bloodshed in Morocco, as well as the serious divisions within the French government delegation and the even deeper divisions between various Moroccan political forces.

Therefore, in Aix-les-Bains, a principled agreement was reached only on the issues of the throne and the establishment of a Moroccan "representative government," with the French government later able to conduct negotiations "on reforms" with the "representative government." For example, an agreement was reached to replace the current Sultan Arafa with a throne council or a regency council.

However, according to the newspapers, the implementation of this agreement will immediately encounter serious difficulties because supporters of the Sultan, the French government, and some representatives in the parliament have raised some objections, reservations, and conditions. On the part of the Moroccan nationalist parties, there are demands for the former Sultan Yusuf to be moved from Madagascar to France, and for him to approve the measures currently being taken.

According to the plan drawn up in Aix-les-Bains, the Moroccan government should be established. However, Moroccan nationalists are now demanding that most of the ministerial positions be given to them, while many French political figures and Moroccan supporters of the current Sultan oppose this.

In order to summarize the negotiations in Aix-les-Bains and determine further measures to resolve the Moroccan crisis, the French cabinet specifically held a meeting on August 28th.

### 北非各地人民武装继续反抗法国殖民者　法国政府同摩洛哥社会人士和政界代表在法国举行谈判

　　北非各地人民武装继续反抗法国殖民者
　　法国政府同摩洛哥社会人士和政界代表在法国举行谈判
    新华社二十九日讯　在法国殖民当局统治下的整个北非，人民反对法国暴行的斗争在继续发展中。二十七日，突尼斯游击队在离阿尔及利亚边境二十英里的布拉姆里附近袭击了驻在突尼斯的法国外籍兵团，据法军当局说，在激战中游击队打死法军十一人，打伤十一人。美联社记者赫德逊指出，这次战斗是法国同突尼斯签订了所谓“自治协定”以后几个月来“最糟的一次”。
    在法国殖民军连日进行镇压行动的摩洛哥，局势仍然非常紧张。法国当局由于害怕在摩洛哥各城市中可能会爆发新的反对法国殖民统治的示威，二十八日已经派遣援军到卡萨布兰卡、拉巴特、非斯和其他城市去。在这些城市中，法国军警乘着装甲车在摩洛哥人居住的区域加紧巡逻。
    据外国通讯社消息，在过去一两天内，摩洛哥爱国者继续在卡萨布兰卡、马拉喀什、马扎干、布希隆等地到处进行反抗法国殖民者的活动。
    在阿尔及利亚的君士坦丁省，二十八日发生了三次阿尔及利亚游击队同法军激战的事件。同时，法军继续向阿尔及利亚增援。据路透社消息说，法国政府已经通知北大西洋集团军队总司令美国将军格仑瑟，要从法国驻西德的军队中抽调六营人前往阿尔及利亚。
    新华社二十九日讯　塔斯社巴黎二十七日讯：二十二日在法国艾克斯—勒—巴恩举行的法国—摩洛哥谈判已经结束。由法国总理埃加·富尔率领的法国政府代表团参加了这次谈判，在谈判时同摩洛哥社会人士和政界代表进行了磋商。摩洛哥方面参加谈判的有首相、一些将军和各城市的负责人员等苏丹当局代表以及民族主义政党“独立党”和“独立民主党”的代表、侨居摩洛哥的法国人代表和在摩洛哥选出的共和国参议院议员。
    从巴黎报纸上的消息可以看出，艾克斯—勒—巴恩的谈判是十分紧张的，这种紧张的局面是由摩洛哥局势的动荡和流血事件以及法国政府代表团内部的严重分歧和摩洛哥各派政治势力之间的更深刻的分歧引起的。
    因此，在艾克斯—勒—巴恩，仅在王位和建立摩洛哥“有代表性的政府”的问题上达成了原则上的协议，法国政府以后可以同“有代表性的政府”进行“关于改革”的谈判。例如，达成了用王位委员会或是摄政委员会来代替现在的苏丹阿拉法的协议。
    但是，据报纸说，执行这种协议立刻就会碰到严重的困难，因为拥护苏丹的人、法国政府和议会中的一些代表提出了一些反对意见、保留和条件。在摩洛哥各民族主义政党这方面则要求让前苏丹优素福从马达加斯加迁到法国去，要求由他批准现在所采取的措施。
    根据在艾克斯—勒—巴恩拟定的计划，应该建立起摩洛哥政府。但是摩洛哥的民族主义者现在已经要求把大部分的大臣职位给予他们，而法国的许多政界人士以及摩洛哥的拥护现苏丹的人都反对这
  一点。
    为了对艾克斯—勒—巴恩的谈判进行总结和确定解决摩洛哥危机的进一步措施，法国内阁特地在八月二十八日举行会议。
