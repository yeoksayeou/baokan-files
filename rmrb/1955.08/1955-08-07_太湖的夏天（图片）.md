Summer on Taihu Lake

Taihu Lake is one of the largest freshwater lakes in China, and also a famous scenic spot. It covers an area of more than three million mu and has a circumference of more than five hundred li. It is rich in various freshwater fish. The area around the lake has fertile soil, developed agriculture, and produces various fruits, so it is known as the "land of fish and rice."

In summer, it is not only a busy farming season, but also a fishing season. Around the summer vacation, many university and college students come here for internships. Many sanatoriums in places such as Yuantouzhu and Xiaojishan in Wuxi also receive model workers and advanced workers from all over the country. (Photo by Wang Zhiyuan, our newspaper)

    太湖的夏天
    太湖是我国最大的淡水湖之一，也是著名的风景区。它的面积有三百多万亩，周围有五百多里，盛产各种淡水鱼类。滨湖地区土壤肥沃，农业很发达，并出产各种水果，所以有“鱼米之乡”之称。
    夏天，这里不仅是农忙的季节，而且又是捕鱼的季节。暑期前后，还有许多大学和专科学校的学生到这里来实习。在无锡鼋头渚和小箕山等地的许多疗养院也接待着来自祖国各地的劳动模范和先进工作者。　（本报王志渊摄）
