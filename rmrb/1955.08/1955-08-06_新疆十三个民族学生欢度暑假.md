Students of thirteen nationalities in Xinjiang Province, totaling nearly 400,000, have successfully completed this year's studies. This year, more than 50,000 young people of all ethnic groups graduated from universities, middle schools, and primary schools. Some of them will continue their studies, while the vast majority will take up construction posts in Xinjiang's industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, finance, economics, culture, and education. Students of all ethnic groups who are not in graduating classes are enjoying their summer vacation. Starting from July 13th, primary and secondary school students of all ethnic groups in Urumqi visited airplanes and held a get-together with Soviet children. Students of all ethnic groups in secondary schools will also go to the scenic "Tianchi" in the high mountains of Tianshan for military excursions and camping. Tianchi is located below the snow-capped peaks in the central part of the Bogda Peak of the Tianshan Mountains and consists of two deep green lakes formed by snowmelt.

    新疆十三个民族学生欢度暑假
    新疆省近四十万名十三个民族的学生，已胜利结束了本年度学习。今年，有五万多名各族青、少年，分别从大、中、小学毕业；他们中的一部分将继续升学，绝大部分将走上新疆的工业、农业、畜牧业和财经、文教等方面的建设岗位。非毕业班的各族学生，正愉快地度着暑假生活。乌鲁木齐市的各族中小学生，从七月十三日起，曾参观了飞机，并同苏联小朋友进行联欢。中等学校的各族学生们，还将到天山高峰风景优美的“天池”去作军事旅行和野营。天池在天山博格达峰中部的雪峰下面，是雪水汇集成的两个深绿色的湖。
