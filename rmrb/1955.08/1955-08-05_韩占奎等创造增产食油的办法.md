    Han Zhan Kui and Others Create Methods for Increasing Edible Oil Production

    Han Zhan Kui, an employee of the Zhangjiakou branch of the China Oils and Fats Company, together with employees of the Zhangjiakou Oils and Fats Chemical Factory, successfully experimented with using flaxseed oil sediment (also known as oil foots or oil dregs) mixed with oil cake to extract oil. Approximately 35 to 37 jin of oil can be extracted from every 100 jin of oil sediment. The extracted oil is edible, the cost of oil extraction is low, and the by-products can also be used as fertilizer. If the Zhangjiakou branch uses this method to extract oil from all of the approximately 20,000 jin of oil sediment it produces each month, it can increase edible oil production by about 7,000 jin.

    In the past, most oil and fat companies sold oil sediment to soap factories to make black soap at a very low price. Moreover, this oil sediment is not convenient for long-distance transportation, so sales were sluggish. Some companies and oil factories have used it to refine good oil, but the refining cost is high, the loss is large, much of the refined oil is not edible, and the by-products cannot be used. The re-extraction method created by Han Zhan Kui does not have these shortcomings.

    韩占奎等创造增产食油的办法
    中国油脂公司张家口分公司职工韩占奎和张家口油脂化工厂职工一起，试验用胡麻油泥（或称油脚、油底子）掺和油饼榨油成功，每百斤油泥约可出油三十五斤到三十七斤。榨出的油可供食用，榨油成本低，副产物还可作肥料。如张家口分公司每月所产的二万斤左右的油泥全部用这个办法榨油，约可增产食油七千斤。
    各地油脂公司以前大部分把油泥出售给肥皂厂制造黑肥皂，售价极廉；而且这种油泥不便长途运输，销路因此很滞。有些公司和油厂曾用以提炼好油，但提炼成本高，损耗大，提炼出来的油很多不能食用，副产品也无法利用。韩占奎创造的复榨办法，就没有这些缺点。
