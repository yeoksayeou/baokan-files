    An'yuan Coal Mine's Dongping Shaft Restored
    Xinhua News Agency
    The restoration project of the Dongping Shaft at the An'yuan Coal Mine under the Pingxiang Mining Bureau was completed at the end of July, two months ahead of the original schedule. The restored roadways have all been lined with durable cement bricks. Currently, mechanical and electrical workers are installing electrical wiring in the roadways. Soon, a large number of electric locomotives will be pulling coal cars, continuously transporting high-quality coking coal to meet the needs of the steel industry.

    The Dongping Shaft is the main transportation artery of the An'yuan Coal Mine. The great strike at the An'yuan Coal Mine in 1922, led directly by Comrade Liu Shaoqi and others, started here. In 1939, the Kuomintang reactionaries, under pressure from the advancing Japanese invaders, blew it up during their retreat to the southwest. Last October, the Pingxiang Mining Bureau, based on drilling results and the suggestions of veteran miners, began the restoration of the Dongping Shaft. Many veteran miners who participated in the great strike at the An'yuan Coal Mine actively supported or participated in the restoration work. They overcame various difficulties such as heavy water seepage and unstable roof conditions in the shaft, and restored the Dongping Shaft in just ten months.

    安源煤矿东平巷恢复
    萍乡矿务局安源煤矿东平巷的恢复工程，已较原计划提前两个月在七月底完成。恢复起来的巷道全部镶砌上了坚固耐久的水泥砖。现在，机电工人们正在巷道里架设电线。不久，在东平巷内将有大批电车拖带着一辆辆煤车，把质量很好的炼焦煤源源不断地运输出来，供应钢铁工业的需要。
    东平巷是安源煤矿的主要运输巷道。一九二二年在刘少奇同志等直接领导下举行的安源煤矿大罢工，就是从这里首先开始的。一九三九年，国民党反动派在日寇进逼下向西南溃退时把它炸毁。去年十月，萍乡矿务局根据钻探结果和老矿工的建议着手恢复东平巷。许多参加过安源煤矿大罢工的老矿工都积极地支援或参加了恢复工作。他们克服了巷内滴水大、顶板烂等种种困难，仅在十个月内就把东平巷恢复起来。　（新华社）
