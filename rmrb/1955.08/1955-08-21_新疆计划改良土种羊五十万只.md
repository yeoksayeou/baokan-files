Xinjiang Province will continue to promote "Xinjiang Sheep" on a large scale this year, planning to use "Xinjiang Sheep" to breed and improve more than 513,000 native sheep, equivalent to the total number of sheep improved in the past three years. The areas where "Xinjiang Sheep" are being promoted have also been expanded.

In order to do a good job in breeding, various places have prepared more than 10,000 "Xinjiang Sheep" breeding rams. The Xinjiang Provincial Animal Husbandry Department has also newly built six sheep artificial insemination stations north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, two of which are mobile stations that can move freely on the grassland. Together with the existing ones, a total of 38 sheep artificial insemination stations in the province will participate in promoting "Xinjiang Sheep" and improving native sheep. At present, the medicines and equipment of these sheep artificial insemination stations have been fully replenished, and some stations have begun to concentrate ewes for breeding.

"Xinjiang Sheep" is the abbreviation of the high-quality "Xinjiang Wool and Meat Dual-Purpose Fine Wool Sheep". The hybrid sheep improved by crossing this kind of sheep with coarse wool sheep are strong and fat, and the wool yield is generally twice as high as that of Kazakh sheep and Mongolian sheep. The wool is soft, fine and white, and can be woven into high-grade wool fabrics. As a result, farmers and herdsmen can increase the production of more livestock products to support national construction, and at the same time increase the income of farmers and herdsmen.

　　新疆计划改良土种羊五十万只
    新疆省今年继续大量推广“新疆羊”，计划用“新疆羊”配种改良土种绵羊五十一万三千多只，相当于过去三年已改良绵羊的总数。推广“新疆羊”的地区也有了扩大。
    为了做好配种工作，各地准备了配种用的“新疆羊”种公羊将达一万多只，新疆省畜牧厅还在天山南北新建六个绵羊人工授精站，其中有两个是流动站，可以在草原上自由移动；连同原有的全省共有三十八个绵羊人工授精站参加推广“新疆羊”、改良土种绵羊的工作。现在，这些绵羊人工授精站的药械已补充配备齐全，有的站并已开始集中配种的母羊。
      “新疆羊”是品质优良的“新疆毛肉兼用细毛种羊”的简称。用这种羊和粗毛绵羊杂交改良后的杂种羊，体格肥壮，毛产量一般都比哈萨克羊和蒙古羊高一倍，毛质柔细洁白，可以织成高级毛织品。农牧民由此可以增产更多的畜产品支援国家建设，同时也增加了农牧民的收入。
