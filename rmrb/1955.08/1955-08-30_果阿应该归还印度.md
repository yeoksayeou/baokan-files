Goa Should Be Returned to India
　　Cuī Qí
    The Indian government and people are fighting to recover their territory of Goa. This is completely justified. However, the Portuguese government has consistently adhered to a colonialist stance, desperately distorting the truth about the Goa issue. On August 22, Portuguese Foreign Minister Cunha told a United Press reporter that Goa was "something that has belonged to Portugal for four hundred and fifty years" and that it was "impossible" to return it to India. He asserted that "world opinion has understood... that the Goa issue is precisely a matter of the Indian Federation's imperialist goals (!)."
    However, all honest people understand that Goa belongs to India, and the Portuguese authorities should end their colonial rule over Goa and return it to India.
    Even before Portugal was established as a nation, Goa was part of India. When the Portuguese first arrived in India at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries, it was the Sikandar Lodi dynasty of India. The Indian people had already written thousands of years of history on their own land. At that time, Portugal had only 1.5 million people, while India was a large country with a population of 80 million. It was impossible for the Portuguese colonists to occupy the entire India, so they invaded Goa and Diu on the west coast of India and established military fortresses and barracks there as colonial bases for monopolizing trade with India and the East. By the 17th century, due to the establishment of British colonial rule in India, Portugal lost its monopoly position in India, but it continued to maintain its occupation of Goa and other places, continuing to enslave the Indian people there. It can be seen that Goa was something seized from India by the Portuguese colonists, and Portugal's rule over Goa is a product of colonialism. The Portuguese authorities' attempt to use the long history of their invasion of Goa to prove their "sovereignty" over Goa is, of course, untenable.
    The Portuguese authorities say that the Pope of Rome "gave" Goa to Portugal a long time ago. As Indian Prime Minister Nehru pointed out, the Portuguese authorities are talking about "words from four centuries ago." In history, it was common for powerful countries to "give" each other the land and property of third countries, or secretly agree to divide them. But today, can anyone recognize the legal effect of such things? For example, when Portuguese Queen Catherine married English King Charles II in 1661, she also "gave" Bombay in India to England as a dowry. Then, should the Indian people therefore recognize England's "sovereignty" over Bombay? For example, before the First World War, Britain and Germany negotiated to divide Portugal. Can Portugal today recognize this behavior of Britain and Germany as their legitimate "right"?
    The Portuguese authorities also say that the "Portuguese citizens" of Goa do not seem willing to merge with India, and that Portugal has a "responsibility" to "defend" them. This is not true. According to official Portuguese statistics published in 1951, out of the 638,000 people in the three Portuguese colonies of Goa, Daman, and Diu, all but 1,438 were of pure Indian descent. Although they have endured centuries of foreign rule, they still retain the language, customs, religion, and culture of the Indian nation. In order to win freedom and liberation, the Indian people of Goa, like the people of other parts of India, have carried out a long and unyielding struggle. After India gained independence, their patriotic movement to demand a return to the embrace of the motherland became even more intense. It is precisely because of this that in recent years, the Portuguese colonial authorities have strengthened their barbaric suppression of the residents of Goa. All democratic rights of the residents of Goa have been deprived and destroyed, and hundreds and thousands of Indian patriots striving for freedom have been arrested, tortured, massacred, or exiled to remote islands in the Atlantic Ocean. Obviously, this violent suppression itself exposes the lies of the Portuguese authorities.
    The Portuguese government clearly knows that it is wrong, but it still makes futile defenses, distorts India's peaceful policies, and attempts to force India to abandon its legitimate rights to Goa. According to the Portuguese authorities, India's demand to recover Goa seems to violate the principles of peaceful coexistence, and they demand that India and Portugal "understand each other" on "a basis of good neighborliness (?)." However, implementing peaceful coexistence means respecting each other's territorial integrity and not infringing upon each other's sovereignty. Obviously, it is the Portuguese authorities who are violating this principle. With the assistance of the North Atlantic group headed by the United States, it is constantly strengthening its military facilities in Goa, increasing its troops stationed there, and making Goa increasingly a military base for Western countries on Indian soil, seriously threatening India's peace and security. The Indian people's struggle to recover their territorial sovereignty and safeguard the country's peace and security is fully in line with the principles of peaceful coexistence and the interests of defending peace.
    Of course, one cannot fail to see that some newspapers in Western countries have shown a different attitude. The American "Washington Post" wrote: "According to the rules of civilization (!), any action by India to recover the old conquered land (referring to Goa) is tantamount to aggression." Recently, this newspaper even slandered the Indian volunteers entering Goa as "rascals." The British "Daily Mail" also attacked the Indian people's struggle to recover Goa as a "racial threat." These propaganda reflect the common position of Western colonialists, who are very afraid of the historical trend of the Indian and Asian peoples striving for and safeguarding national independence, and are trying to stop it. They simply do not want to see the Indian people recover their territory and sovereignty in Goa, but hope that Western countries will continue to maintain a colonial position and military base in India. This attitude clearly encourages the Portuguese colonialists' arrogant behavior of occupying Goa and hinders the rational resolution of the Goa issue.
    However, the Indian people have announced to the world that they will never give up until they recover Goa. Recently, Indian Prime Minister Nehru once again expressed India's determination, saying: "Because we are opposed to colonialism everywhere, we cannot tolerate the continued existence of colonial rule on a small part of Indian territory." The people of Asian and African countries fully understand and sympathize with this solemn stance of the Indian people. The people of Asia and Africa are increasingly uniting in the common struggle against colonialism and in defense of peace. All honest people believe that Goa should be returned to India.

### 果阿应该归还印度

　　果阿应该归还印度
　　崔奇
    印度政府和人民正为收复他们的领土果阿而斗争。这是完全正当的。但是葡萄牙政府却始终坚持殖民主义的立场，拚命歪曲果阿问题的真相。八月二十二日，葡萄牙外长舒纳向合众社记者说，果阿是“四百五十年以来一直属于葡萄牙的东西”，它“不可能”还给印度。他断言“世界舆论已经弄明白了……果阿问题恰好是印度联邦的帝国主义目标（！）的问题。”
    但是，一切正直的人们都明白，果阿是属于印度的，葡萄牙当局应该结束它对果阿的殖民统治，把果阿归还印度。
    还在葡萄牙没有立国之前，果阿就是印度的一部分。十五—十六世纪之交，当葡萄牙人最初来到印度时，正是印度的西康达罗第王朝，印度人民在自己的土地上已经写下几千年的历史了。那时候，葡萄牙只有一百五十万人，印度则是一个拥有八千万人口的大国，葡萄牙殖民者要占领整个印度是不可能的，于是它就在印度西海岸侵占了果阿和第乌等地，在那里建立了军事要塞和兵营，以作为它垄断印度以及东方贸易的殖民据点。到十七世纪，由于英国在印度开始建立殖民统治，葡萄牙丧失了它在印度的垄断地位，但是它仍然一直保持着对果阿等地的占领，继续奴役那里的印度人民。由此可见，果阿是葡萄牙殖民者从印度手中抢去的东西，葡萄牙对果阿的统治是殖民主义的产物。葡萄牙当局想用它侵占果阿的历史久远来证明它对果阿拥有
  “主权”，当然是站不住脚的。
    葡萄牙当局说，在很早以前，罗马教皇就把果阿“赠送”给葡萄牙了。这正如印度总理尼赫鲁所指出的，葡萄牙当局所说的是些“四世纪以前的话”。在历史上，强国之间把第三国的土地财产互相“赠送”，或者秘密协议互相瓜分，是屡见不鲜的。可是今天还能有什么人会承认这种事情的法律效力呢？举例说吧，一六六一年葡萄牙女王卡萨林嫁给英王查理二世时，也曾以印度的孟买作为嫁妆“赠送”给英国，那末，难道印度人民就要因此承认英国对孟买的“主权”吗？又如在第一次世界大战前，英国和德国曾经谈判要瓜分葡萄牙，难道今天的葡萄牙能够承认英国和德国的这种行为是它们的正当“权利”吗？
    葡萄牙当局还说，果阿的“葡萄牙公民”似乎并不愿意和印度合并，而葡萄牙则有“责任”“保卫”他们。这不是事实。根据一九五一年葡萄牙官方发表的统计数字，在果阿、达曼、第乌三个葡萄牙殖民地的六十三万八千人口中，除了一千四百三十八人外，都是纯粹的印度血统。他们虽然经受了几个世纪的外国统治，但是仍然保持着印度民族的语言、风俗、宗教和文化。为了争取自由解放，果阿的印度人民，和印度其他地方的人民一样，进行了长期的不屈不挠的斗争。印度获得独立以后，他们要求回到祖国怀抱的爱国运动更形高涨了。正是因为这样，近几年来，葡萄牙殖民当局对果阿居民加强了野蛮的镇压。果阿居民的一切民主权利已被剥夺和摧残，争取自由的印度爱国者成百成千地被逮捕、拷打、屠杀，或者被放逐到大西洋的孤岛上去。很明显，这种暴力镇压的本身就揭穿了葡萄牙当局的谎言。
    葡萄牙政府明明知道自己理屈，但是它仍然进行徒劳的辩解，歪曲印度的和平政策，企图迫使印度放弃它对果阿的正当权利。按照葡萄牙当局的说法，印度要求收复果阿，似乎是违反了和平共处的原则，它要求印度和葡萄牙在“一种善邻（？）的基础上”“互相谅解”。可是，实行和平共处，就是要互相尊重领土的完整，不侵犯别人的主权。显然，违反这个原则的是葡萄牙当局。它在以美国为首的北大西洋集团的援助下，正不断地加强在果阿的军事设施，增加那里的驻军，使果阿日益成为西方国家在印度土地上的军事基地，严重地威胁着印度的和平与安全。印度人民为收复自己的领土主权，维护国家的和平安全所进行的斗争，是完全符合和平共处的原则与保卫和平的利益的。
    当然，人们也不能不看到，西方国家某些报纸却表现了不同的态度。美国“华盛顿邮报”写道：“根据文明（！）的规则，印度想收回老征服地
  （指果阿）的任何行动都等于侵略。”最近，这个报纸更诬蔑进入果阿的印度志愿人员是“无赖汉”。英国“每日邮报”也攻击印度人民要求收复果阿的斗争是“种族威胁”。这些宣传反映了西方殖民主义者的共同立场，他们十分恐惧印度和亚洲各国人民争取和维护民族独立的历史潮流，而力图加以阻挡。他们根本不愿意看到印度人民收回自己在果阿的领土和主权，而是希望西方国家在印度继续保持一个殖民阵地和军事据点。这种态度显然鼓励了葡萄牙殖民主义者霸占果阿的蛮横行为，阻碍着果阿问题的合理解决。
    但是，印度人民已经向全世界宣布，他们不收复果阿是决不罢休的。最近印度总理尼赫鲁再一次表明印度的决心说：“由于我们是反对任何地方的殖民主义的，我们不可能容忍在印度的一小部分领土上继续存在着殖民统治。”亚非各国人民完全理解和同情印度人民的这种严正的立场。亚非人民在反对殖民主义和保卫和平的共同斗争中正日益紧密地团结起来。一切正直的人民都认为，果阿应该归还印度。
