    Why Can't Hatred Stand Up?
    Zang Kejia

    You often have class struggle on the tip of your tongue,
    You also know to hate class enemies,
    But when a concrete enemy stands before you,
    Why can't hatred stand up?

    How did Hu Feng hate the Party, hate the revolution?
    Hatred, like flames, burned his viscera, made smoke from his seven orifices,
    His hatred was so sharp,
    Sharper than a newly unsheathed blade!

    How did Hu Feng hate the people, hate progressive writers?
    He hated to the point of clenching his fists and grinding his teeth!
    This irreconcilable hatred
    Turned his gaze into venomous snakes!

    Hu Feng hated us to the marrow of his bones,
    But your hatred lacks sharpness,
    Hu Feng's hatred for us is like strong liquor,
    Your hatred for him is like wine syrup.

    Hate is for the sake of love, only those who can love can hate!
    Hu Feng loved his "bright future,"
    That's why he hated to the point of wanting to throw his head away;
    Why can't you "bring yourself to hate" the enemy?
    This is because you lack love for the revolution!

    仇恨为什么挺不起身
    臧克家
    你常把阶级斗争挂在嘴角上，
    你也知道去恨阶级敌人，
    一个具体的敌人站在你面前，
    仇恨为什么却挺不起身？
    胡风怎样仇恨党、仇恨革命？
    仇恨像火焰，使他五脏燃烧，七窍生烟，
    他的仇恨是那么尖锐，
    比刚出鞘的尖刀更尖！
    胡风怎样仇恨人民、怎样仇恨进步作家？
    他恨得磨拳擦掌，切齿咬牙！
    这种不共戴天的仇恨，
    把他的眼光变成一条条毒蛇！
    胡风把我们恨入骨髓，
    你的仇恨却没有锋芒，
    胡风对我们的仇恨像烈酒，
    你对他的仇恨像葡萄酒浆。
    恨是为了爱，能爱才能恨！
    胡风热爱他“远大的未来”，
    他才恨得要把头颅抛出来；
    你为什么对敌人“恨不起来”？
    这是对革命缺少了热爱！
