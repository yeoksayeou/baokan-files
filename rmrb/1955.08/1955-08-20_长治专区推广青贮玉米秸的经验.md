Changzhi Special District, Shanxi Province, in order to overcome the difficulty of lacking livestock feed in winter, carried out corn stalk silage work in 215 agricultural cooperatives, 10 local state-owned farms, and the China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm during the autumn harvest of 1954. These units ensiled a total of 274 silage cellars, totaling more than 2.32 million jin. According to inspections, excluding some spoilage due to improper cellar site selection, insufficient trampling, or excessive water addition, 83.5 percent of the silage was successful. These units expanded their feed sources and solved the problem of livestock lacking feed in winter due to the silage corn stalks. At the same time, due to the demonstration of these units in this work, nearby farmers saw the benefits of silage feed with their own eyes and began to realize that this is the best way to solve the shortage of winter grass, laying a good foundation for further promotion of silage feed in the future.

Using corn stalks to make silage feed is a new task. When it was first promoted, many farmers had ideological concerns, fearing that after ensiling, it would "turn into rotten manure," "waste labor," and "premature harvesting would affect corn yields." In order to dispel these ideological concerns, the agricultural production leading department of the special district conducted full mobilization at meetings of agricultural section chiefs of various counties, farm directors, and animal husbandry staff, and distributed propaganda materials on how to make silage. They also organized staff and veterinarians in the townships to carry out extensive publicity and mobilization through central work and trough inspections. In order to do a good job of key demonstrations for this work, the agricultural production leading department of the special district also convened a meeting of the heads of the animal husbandry sections of various counties and relevant unit staff to impart and practice silage technology. All counties selected key points in the promotion and organized staff and masses from nearby agricultural cooperatives to visit the key points. According to statistics from six counties including Jincheng, Gaoping, Lingchuan, and Yangcheng, 917 people visited the silage key points.

According to experiments in many units, the silage cellar site must be selected in a place with high terrain, low groundwater level, far away from trees and rivers, close to livestock pens, sunny and dry, and with heavy clay soil. The size of the cellar should be determined according to the number of livestock and needs. Generally, a circular shape with a diameter of six feet and a depth of nine feet, which can hold 8,000 jin, is appropriate. The cellar wall should be firm and smooth to prevent air from entering. Many agricultural cooperatives and the China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm in thirteen counties including Qin County and Huguan have achieved good results in silage feed storage because the cellar sites were well-selected and the cellars were dug according to standards. A silage cellar of the Shicun Agricultural Cooperative in Jincheng County rotted two-thirds of the silage corn stalks because it was dug near a large tree. The Guohe Agricultural Cooperative in Pingshun County rotted all of the silage corn stalks because it dug the cellar near a ditch and the soil was loose.

In selecting silage materials, the principle of not affecting corn yield and maintaining silage quality should be followed. Experience has proven that the quality of silage corn stalks is directly related to the quality of silage feed in the future. Therefore, the selection and cutting of silage materials should be timely, and they should be harvested and stored on the same day to prevent the evaporation of water in the stalks.

Silage feed can be opened and fed to livestock 40 days after storage. Imparting technology on opening the cellar, taking materials, and feeding is also very important. Last year, some units in Changzhi Special District did not do these tasks well. Some discarded the good feed after opening the cellar because livestock were not accustomed to eating it; others experienced spoilage due to improper management of the silage feed after opening the cellar.

The masses' reaction to using silage corn stalks as feed is basically good. The silage feed of the Chengzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Jincheng was not rotten at all after opening the cellar, the color was yellow-green, and the taste was very good. The donkeys loved to eat it, leaving not even a single stubble. Nearby masses regretted seeing this situation, saying, "Why didn't we also store a cellar in the first place?" The head of the Cicun Agricultural Cooperative in Qin County said, "Silage grass is good, the taste is good, and livestock love to eat it. We stored too little this year, and we must store two more cellars next year." The Shijiapo Agricultural Cooperative in Lingchuan County tried storing two cellars of corn stalks last year. The nine horses in this cooperative all gained weight from eating silage feed. Cooperative member Niu Yuanhai said, "Silage grass is good, and even weak livestock can gain weight from eating it." Niu Laihuan of this cooperative originally did not believe in silage feed at all, but later, after seeing that the horses in the cooperative were all gaining weight, he secretly took two baskets of silage corn stalks to try feeding his own cattle.

    长治专区推广青贮玉米秸的经验
    晋青
    山西省长治专区为了克服牲畜冬季饲料缺乏的困难，一九五四年秋收时，在全区二百一十五个农业合作社，十个地方国营农场和中苏友好集体农庄进行了玉米秸青贮工作。这些单位共青贮玉米秸二百七十四窖，共有二百三十二万多斤。据检查，这些青贮饲料，除部分因窖址选择不当、踩踏不实或加水过多发生腐烂外，青贮成功的占百分之八十三点五。这些单位由于青贮玉米秸秆而扩大了饲料来源，解决了牲畜冬季缺乏饲料的问题。同时由于这些单位在这一工作上的示范，使附近农民亲眼看到青贮饲料的好处，开始认识到这是解决冬草不足的最好方法，给今后进一步推广青贮饲料打下了良好基础。
    利用玉米秸秆做青贮饲料是一件新的工作，在开始推行时有不少农民有怕贮后“弄不成沤了粪”“白误工”“提前收获影响玉米收成”等思想顾虑。为了解除这些思想顾虑，专区的农业生产领导部门在各县农业科长、农场场长、畜牧工作人员等会议上进行了充分的发动，并印发了怎样青贮的宣传材料，还组织了在乡的工作人员和兽医，通过中心工作和看槽检查，广泛进行宣传发动。为做好这一工作的重点示范，专区农业生产领导部门还召开了各县畜牧股股长和有关单位的工作人员开会，进行青贮技术的传授和实习。各县在推广中都选择了重点，组织附近农业合作社的工作人员和群众去重点参观。据晋城、高平、陵川、阳城等六县统计，到重点参观青贮的就有九百一十七人。
    据许多单位的试验，青贮窖址必须选择地势高、地下水位低、离树木河流远、离畜圈近和向阳干燥、土壤黏重的地方。窖的大小应根据牲畜头数和需要来决定，一般的以圆形直径六尺，深九尺，一窖可装八千斤为适宜。窖壁要打坚实光滑，使其不透空气。沁县、壶关等十三个县的许多农业合作社和中苏友好集体农庄等所贮的青饲料，都因窖址选择得好，窖挖得合标准，而得到良好的结果。晋城县史村农业合作社的一个青贮窖因挖在大树附近，而使青贮的玉米秸烂了三分之二。平顺县国和农业合作社因把窖打在水沟附近，又加土质松软，青贮的玉米秸全部腐烂了。
    在选择青贮材料上，应该掌握既不影响玉米产量，又能保持青贮质量的原则。经验证明，青贮的玉米秸秆的好坏，直接关系将来青贮饲料的质量，因此在选割青贮材料时应该适时，并且要当天收割当天贮藏，以防止秸秆内的水分蒸发。
    青贮的饲料在贮后四十天即可开窖饲喂牲畜。传授开窖、取料、饲喂技术也是很重要的。长治专区去年有些单位就因为没有做好这些工作，有的在开窖后因家畜不习惯吃就把好的饲料丢掉；有的由于对开窖后的青贮饲料管理不当而发生腐烂现象。
    群众对利用青贮玉米秸做饲料的反映基本上是好的。晋城成庄农业合作社的青贮饲料开窖后一点也没有腐烂，颜色黄绿，味很好，驴很爱吃，连一点圪节也不剩。附近群众看到这一情况后悔说：“当初为什么不也贮一窖。”沁县次村农业合作社社长说：“青贮草就是好，味气好牲口爱吃，今年贮少了，明年一定要多贮两窖。”陵川石家坡农业合作社去年试贮了两窖玉米秸，这个社的九匹马由于吃青贮饲料都上膘了。社员牛袁海说：“青贮的草就是好，瘦弱的牲口吃了都能上膘。”这个社的牛来拴原来对青贮饲料最不相信，后来看见社内的马都吃的上膘了，也偷偷地取了两箩头青贮玉米秸试喂自己的牛。
