To the Editor:

The Ministry of Forestry's Survey and Design Bureau (hereinafter referred to as the Design Bureau) exhibits serious extravagance and waste in its living welfare facilities.

The Forest Survey Brigade, which belongs to the Design Bureau, was originally scheduled to move to Beijing, so 255,000 yuan was invested in building a dining hall. Later, the Forest Survey Brigade decided not to move, but the Design Bureau still built the dining hall in April of this year under the guise of "doubling as an auditorium." Furthermore, when the Ministry of Forestry's Supervisory Department suggested changing the design of the terrazzo floor on the second floor of the dining hall to a cement floor, the Design Bureau refused to accept this suggestion under the pretext of "holding dances to entertain experts." Such waste in construction also occurred in the dormitory completed last year. Building an open-air dance floor on the roof of this dormitory wasted more than 20,000 yuan and resulted in one less floor being built. Other unnecessary equipment waste amounted to around 20,000 yuan.

In addition, the bureau currently has five cars, and according to May statistics, they were only used five times throughout the month, with each car being used only once a month on average, leaving the drivers frequently idle. The bureau's department-level staff all have single-person offices, and the dormitories are also equipped with a large amount of furniture. For example, Office Director Yang Maizhi's family of six has two spring beds and two double beds in their dormitory, plus more than 20 pieces of furniture such as various cabinets and tables.

More seriously, the Design Bureau built a sanatorium in Xingcheng, Liaoning, with an area of 1,800 square meters. This sanatorium has a total of 58 staff members and is well-equipped with furniture; however, there are currently only eight patients receiving treatment, and the maximum number at any time does not exceed fifteen.

The reason why this extravagance and waste can occur is inseparable from the Design Bureau's pursuit of "ostentation" and the bureaucracy of the superior authorities. For example, when building the dormitory, the bureau created a plan based on the principle of "rather more than less," and the Ministry of Forestry's Basic Construction Department and other units approved the plan in full during the review. The technical design also went through layers of approval from the Ministry's Basic Construction Department, General Office, and other units, but no one raised any objections to projects such as the open-air dance floor on the roof. I believe that the Ministry of Forestry should no longer tolerate the Design Bureau's extravagance and waste but should quickly inspect and correct it.

### 林业部调查设计局在生活福利设施上的浪费现象很严重

    林业部调查设计局在生活福利设施上的浪费现象很严重编辑同志：
    林业部调查设计局（以下简称设计局）在生活福利设施上有严重的铺张浪费现象。
    设计局所属的森林调查大队原来准备迁到北京来，因此投资二十五万五千元修了一个食堂大楼；后来森林调查大队已经决定不来了，但是设计局在今年四月用“兼作礼堂”的名义仍然建造食堂大楼。并且，当林业部监察司提出把食堂的二楼水磨石地的设计改为水泥地面时，设计局竟用“要举行舞会招待专家”为借口，拒绝接受这个意见。像这种建筑中的浪费现象，在去年完工的宿舍中也出现过。这个宿舍在楼顶修了个露天舞场就浪费了二万多元，并且因此少建了一层楼；其它不必要的设备浪费也在二万元左右。
    另外，局里现有汽车五辆，据五月份统计，全月仅出车五次，每辆车平均每月只出车一次，司机们经常闲着。局里的处长级工作人员都有单人办公室，宿舍里也配备了大量家具。如办公室主任杨迈之一家六口人，宿舍里配有弹簧床二张，双人床二张，加上各种柜子桌椅等共二十多件。
    更严重的是，设计局在辽宁兴城修建了一座面积一千八百平方公尺的疗养所。这个疗养所共有工作人员五十八个，家具设备也很讲究；但是休养的病员目前只有八人，最多时也不超过十五人。
    这种铺张浪费现象之所以能够出现，是同设计局追求“排场”的思想和上级机关的官僚主义分不开的。如在兴建宿舍的时候，局里根据“宁多毋少”的原则造出计划，林业部基本建设司等单位在审核计划的时候就照数批准了。技术设计也同样经过部里的基本建设司、办公厅等单位层层审批，但对楼顶露天舞场等项目，谁都没有提出意见。我认为，对于设计局的铺张浪费行为，林业部不应该再采取容忍的态度，而应该迅速加以检查和纠正。王伟仲
