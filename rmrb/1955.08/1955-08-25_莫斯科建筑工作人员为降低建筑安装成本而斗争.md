　　Moscow Construction Workers Fight to Reduce Building Installation Costs
　　By M. Balixin, Soviet Engineer and Economist
    The Soviet Union is undertaking large-scale construction projects. In this context, reducing the cost of construction projects has extremely important national economic significance. Every one percent reduction in construction production costs will save the country millions of funds, enabling us to build dozens of new industrial enterprises and hundreds of well-equipped residences and other buildings.
    The Party and the government have set a task for Soviet construction workers: construction must not only be fast and good, but also cheap.
    In order to successfully solve these tasks, construction workers are constantly improving the arrangement of the entire construction work, such as the formulation of permanent engineering plans, the three-dimensional and plan layout of houses and buildings, the technical and technological processes of construction, and the organizational forms of the construction industry.
    The experience of construction workers in Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union, is very worthy of being absorbed.
    According to a special government resolution in 1954, a large-scale joint construction organization, the Moscow General Bureau of Residential and Civil Construction Engineering, was established in Moscow. It was built by merging more than 50 construction engineering companies.
    The establishment of the Moscow General Bureau of Residential and Civil Construction Engineering has created possible conditions for further greatly improving the construction industry, more fully utilizing the capabilities of construction organizations, widely adopting industrialized construction methods, and reducing the cost of building installation work on this basis.
      The technical and economic indicators achieved by the Moscow General Bureau of Residential and Civil Construction Engineering in the first year of operation have confirmed this point. The labor productivity of the workers in this organization increased by 14.4% in 1954 compared with 1953, and increased by 24.5% in the first quarter of 1955 compared with the same quarter of 1954; the cost of building installation work decreased by 4.6% in 1954, and decreased by 8.3% in the first quarter of 1955.
    What methods were used to achieve these remarkable achievements?
    The work of the Moscow General Bureau of Residential and Civil Construction Engineering is based on the "Ten-Year Reconstruction Plan of Moscow from 1951 to 1960" and the "Four-Year Plan for Housing Construction Distribution from 1954 to 1957." With these two plans, not only the construction organizations, but also the design organizations and the industrial enterprises that produce building materials have a very clear understanding of the prospects of the work, which enables them to comprehensively, systematically and proportionally exert their capabilities. An important requirement that should be considered when formulating permanent engineering and construction organization work plans is: to ensure the centralized use of production resources (people, materials, technology) to build major buildings, so as to shorten the construction time of each individual building. It is of great significance to stipulate the necessary cross-year reserve projects in the plan for fully utilizing the capabilities of the construction organization throughout the year. According to the Four-Year Plan for Housing Construction Distribution, the amount of reserve projects of the Moscow General Bureau of Residential and Civil Construction Engineering has increased from 15% on January 1, 1954 to 33% on January 1, 1955.
    The design organizations that design residential and cultural life construction projects in Moscow have been merged and uniformly led by the Moscow Soviet Architectural Planning Administration. This will enable the standardization of housing and individual distribution projects to be widely carried out, and the amount of construction projects with fixed-type designs and repeated-use designs can be increased, which will not only reduce the cost of design work, but also help expand the production of building accessories and reduce its cost. For example, in 1954, the Architectural Planning Administration issued a list of precast reinforced concrete components, which stipulated that the number of type sizes should be reduced by nearly two-thirds; the specialization of an enterprise that produces a limited number of accessories can increase the product output per square meter of production site by three times, reduce the labor consumption of products by one-half, and reduce the cost by 25% to 30%.
    From 1956, 70% of residential houses and all school houses in Moscow will be built according to standard designs.
    When carrying out design, special attention should be paid to the possibility of saving in the three-dimensional and plan layout schemes and structural schemes of houses and buildings. For example, in the currently adopted residential housing fixed-type units, the ratio of housing volume to living area is 6.7 to 6.8, while the previously adopted units were 7.8 to 8. This makes the cost per square meter of living area 12% to 14% cheaper.
    When compiling and approving designs, excessive architectural decorations and embellishments, excessively wide roads and sidewalks, etc. on houses are not allowed. In order to avoid waste in the laying of underground pipelines for engineering, detailed regulations must be made in terms of internal planning of the neighborhood.
    Reducing the cost of building installation work and reducing construction costs at the design stage are of the same great significance. This is to be achieved by improving the technical level of construction, improving the construction process and organization, and enabling the construction industry to master the organizational and technical principles of industrial production.
    The main link in the industrialization of construction is the transition to installing houses and buildings with accessories and structures prefabricated in factories, first of all, installing these houses and buildings with reinforced concrete accessories and structures.
    At present, all the main structures of residential houses and houses for cultural life in Moscow, from the foundation to the roof, are made of prefabricated components.
    In the post-war period, the use of reinforced concrete accessories in Moscow has almost more than doubled.
    The widespread adoption of prefabricated structures can shorten the construction time of houses and buildings, save steel and wood, and reduce the labor consumption of construction.
    The completion of a five-story house only takes five or six months, an eight-story house only takes eight to ten months, and a five-story school building only takes four months. All the workers, engineering, and technical personnel of the "Moscow Residential Housing Construction Company," an advanced construction trust, undertook the task of building a nine-story building with a living area of 31,000 square meters in eight months; the employees of many other construction organizations also undertook similar tasks. By shortening the construction period, they reduced the incidental expenses that depend on the length of the construction period.
    In the case of using prefabricated reinforced concrete, the use of wood is reduced by two-thirds, the steel is reduced by 60%, and the labor consumption is reduced by one-half.
    In addition, the service life of the houses is extended, and the maintenance costs of these houses are reduced.
    In 1954, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union passed the "Resolution on the Development of the Production of Prefabricated Reinforced Concrete Structures and Building Components." The resolution stipulated that 402 factories and 200 construction material factories should be built within two years, and that the production of prefabricated reinforced concrete structures should be expanded five times, reaching an annual output of 9.8 million cubic meters in 1957. The most advanced forms of construction - large precast panel construction and large block construction - have been further developed.
    Construction organizations receive a large number of highly productive construction machines from the industrial sector every year.
    At present, the degree of mechanization on construction sites in Moscow has reached the point where: 87% of earthwork, 73% of loading and unloading work, 99% of mixing concrete and mortar, 56% of plastering work, and 65% of painting work are mechanized.
    In the transition from the mechanization of individual construction processes to the full mechanization, the laborious transportation work and decorative work should be mechanized first.
    In order to save materials and eliminate material losses, some improved transportation tools are adopted, such as brick cages and bottom plates for transporting wall materials, and special cement trucks; rules for storing, keeping and using materials on construction sites are formulated. Thanks to the socialist competition among workers' groups to save material consumption, great results have been achieved in eliminating material losses. For example, according to the materials of the Moscow Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, in ten construction organizations in Moscow, 3,180 workers who launched a competition to reduce construction costs saved nearly 300,000 bricks, 113 cubic meters of mortar, 317 cubic meters of wood, 13 tons of steel, 84 tons of building gypsum and other materials in six months.
    In the construction using large prefabricated accessories, the loss of materials has been almost completely eliminated.
    Choosing the most reasonable supply lines, eliminating opposite transportation, unifying and merging automobile businesses also help reduce material consumption. For example, the Moscow General Bureau of Residential and Civil Construction, due to unifying and improving the organization of its automobile transportation business, saved 600 cars for the national economy despite the increase in transportation volume. As a result of the implementation of the above measures, the materials consumed per million rubles of engineering in 1954 decreased by 3.6%, while in the first quarter of 1955 it decreased by 5.3%.
    With the increase of technical equipment on construction sites, the full utilization of the capabilities of construction machines is of great significance for reducing construction costs. The merger of some scattered, small-scale mechanized construction management offices and mechanical supply stations into powerful mechanized construction trusts conducted by the Moscow General Bureau of Residential and Civil Construction freed up 300 construction machines for other purposes. The expenditure in this area decreased by 6.2% in 1954 and by 15.2% in the first quarter of 1955.
    Very good results have also been achieved in terms of miscellaneous expenses, with miscellaneous expenses decreasing by 4.3% in 1954 and by 18.6% in the first quarter of 1955.
    In order to further reduce construction costs, the Moscow General Bureau of Residential and Civil Construction has formulated and is implementing a concrete organizational and technical measures plan, the purpose of which is to expand and deepen industrialized construction methods, increase the production and use of prefabricated reinforced concrete accessories and structures, improve the level of mechanization, improve production organization, and implement a strict economy system in the consumption of labor, materials, funds and other resources.
    These measures will be implemented to the grassroots links of the construction organization - the work sections and groups - and will be implemented by these links.
    The construction workers in Moscow are increasing the amount of engineering year by year. In 1951, they built 735,000 square meters of new residential area, in 1952 they built 782,000 square meters, in 1953 they built 813,000 square meters, and in 1954 they built 910,000 square meters. The plan for 1955 stipulated that 1 million square meters of residential area should be built. The construction workers have undertaken to complete this task before December 20, while ensuring further reduction of construction costs.

　　莫斯科建筑工作人员为降低建筑安装成本而斗争
　　苏联工程师、经济学家　姆·巴里辛
    苏联正在进行着大规模的建筑工程，在这种情况下，降低建筑工程的造价，有着极重要的国民经济意义。建筑的生产耗费每降低百分之一，都会使国家节省成百万的资金，这样就使我们能多建造几十个新的工业企业，成百所设备完善的住宅和其它建筑物。
    党和政府向苏维埃建筑工作人员提出了一项任务：建筑不仅要快、好，而且还要便宜。
    为了顺利地解决这些任务，建筑工作人员正在不断地改进对整个建筑工作的安排：如永久工程计划的制定，房屋和建筑物的立体和平面布置方案，施工的技术和工艺的过程，建筑工业的组织形式。
    苏联首都莫斯科的建筑工作人员在这方面的经验，是很值得吸取的。
    根据一九五四年政府的特别决议，在莫斯科建立了一个大规模的联合建筑机构——莫斯科居住和民用建筑工程总局，它是合并五十多个建筑工程公司而建成的。
    莫斯科居住和民用建筑工程总局的建立，创造了可能的条件，以便进一步大大改进建筑事业，更充分地利用建筑机构的能力，广泛采用工业化的建筑方法，并在这个基础上来降低建筑安装工作的成本。
      莫斯科居住和民用建筑工程总局第一年工作所达到的技术经济指标，就证实了这一点。这个机构的工人的劳动生产率，一九五四年比一九五三年提高了百分之十四点四，而一九五五年第一季度又比一九五四年同一季度提高了百分之二十四点五；一九五四年建筑安装工作的成本降低了百分之四点六，而在一九五五年的第一季度则降低了百分之八点三。
    是用什么方法取得了这些卓越的成绩的呢？
    莫斯科居住和民用建筑工程总局的工作，是根据一九五一—一九六○年莫斯科十年改建计划和一九五四—一九五七年房屋建筑分布四年计划来进行的。有了这两个计划，不仅使建筑机构，而且也使设计机构以及生产建筑材料的工业企业对工作的远景有了十分明确的认识，这使它们可以全面地、有计划地和按比例地发挥自己的能力。在制定永久工程和建筑组织的工作计划时，应当考虑到的一个重要要求是：保证集中使用生产资源（人、物资、技术）来建造主要的建筑物，以便缩短建造每个个别建筑物的时间。在计划中规定出必要的跨年度储备工程，对于在整个年度里充分利用建筑机构的能力具有很大的意义。根据房屋建筑分布四年计划，莫斯科居住和民用建筑工程总局的储备工程量已从一九五四年一月一日的百分之十五，增加到一九五五年一月一日的百分之三十三。
    设计莫斯科的居住和文化生活建筑工程的设计机构，已经合并而由莫斯科苏维埃建筑规划管理局统一领导。这样就能广泛地展开房屋和个别分布工程的标准化工作，可以增加定型设计和重复使用的设计的建筑工程量，这不仅会降低设计工作费用，而且还可以帮助扩大建筑配件的生产并降低它的费用。例如，在一九五四年建筑规划管理局曾颁发了一个装配式钢筋混凝土制件的品名表，其中规定了类型尺寸的数目要减少几近三分之二；一个企业生产有限几种配件的企业的专业化，可以使一平方公尺生产场地的产品量提高到三倍，把产品的劳动消耗量减轻二分之一，而成本也降低百分之二十五到三十。
    从一九五六年起，莫斯科将有百分之七十的居住房屋和全部学校房屋都按照标准设计来建造。
    在进行设计时，应当特别注意房屋和建筑物的立体和平面布置方案与结构方案的节约的可能。例如在目前所采用的居住房屋定型单元中，房屋体积同居住面积的比例为六点七比六点八，而以前所采用的单元则为七点八比八。这就使每一平方公尺的居住面积的造价便宜百分之十二到十四。
    在编制和批准设计时，决不允许在房屋上有过多的建筑艺术的装璜和装饰，过宽的道路和人行道等等。为了避免在敷设工程地下管线上的浪费，必须在街坊内部规划方面做出详细的规定。
    降低建筑安装工作的成本和在设计阶段降低建筑造价有着同样重大的意义。这是要通过提高施工的技术水平，改善施工的工艺过程和组织，使建筑工业掌握工业生产的组织技术原则来实现的。
    在建筑的工业化事业中的主要环节，就是过渡到用工厂中预制好的配件和结构来安装房屋和建筑物，首先是用钢筋混凝土配件和结构来安装这些房屋和建筑物。
    目前，莫斯科的居住房屋和文化生活用的房屋的全部主要结构，从地基到屋顶都是采用预制好的构件的。
    在战后时期，莫斯科对钢筋混凝土配件的采用，几乎扩大了两倍多。
    广泛采用装配式结构，可以缩短房屋和建筑物的施工时间，节省钢材和木料，并可减轻施工的劳动消耗。
    五层楼住宅的建成只需用五、六个月，八层楼住宅只需八到十个月，五层楼的学校建筑只需四个月。“莫斯科居住房屋建筑公司”这个先进的建筑托辣斯的全体工人、工程、技术人员承担了在八个月里建成一座有三万一千平方公尺居住面积的九层楼房的任务；其他许多建筑机构的员工也承担了类似的任务。由于缩减了施工期限，他们把取决于施工期长短的杂费开支减少了。
    在采用装配式钢筋混凝土的情况下，对木料的使用减少了三分之二，钢材减少了百分之六十，劳动的耗费减少了二分之一。
    此外还延长了房屋的使用年限，并且减少了这些房屋的维持费。
    一九五四年苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议通过了“关于发展装配式钢筋混凝土结构和建筑构件的生产”的决议。决议规定在两年内建筑四百零二个工厂和二百个工地建筑材料工厂，规定把装配式钢筋混凝土结构的生产扩大到五倍，一九五七年要达到年产九百八十万立方公尺。建筑中最先进的形式——大型预制板式建筑和大型砌块式建筑，得到了更大的发展。
    建筑机构每年都从工业方面得到大量生产效能很高的建筑用机器。
    目前在莫斯科的各建筑工地，机械化已经达到了这样的程度：土方工作百分之八十七，装卸工作百分之七十三，拌制混凝土和砂浆百分之九十九，粉刷工作百分之五十六，油漆工作百分之六十五。
    在从个别施工过程的机械化转向全面机械化的工作中，首先应当使费力的运输工作和装饰工作机械化。
    为了节约材料和消除材料的损失，采用了一些完善的运输工具，如运送墙壁材料的砖笼和底板以及专门运水泥的汽车；制定了在各建筑工地储藏、保管和使用材料的规则。由于各工人小组间展开了节约材料消耗的社会主义竞赛，使在消除材料的损失方面获得了巨大的效果。例如，根据莫斯科市工会理事会的材料，在莫斯科十个建筑组织中，三千一百八十名为降低建筑造价而展开竞赛的工人们，在六个月中就节约了近三十万块砖、一百一十三公方的砂浆、三百一十七公方的木料、十三吨钢材、八十四吨建筑用石膏和其他材料。
    在用大型预制配件来进行的建筑中，几乎已完全消除了材料的损失。
    选择最合理的供应线路，消除相向运输，统一和合并汽车业务，也都有助于材料耗费的减少。例如，莫斯科居住和民用建筑总局由于统一并改进了本单位的汽车运输业务的组织，尽管在运输量增大的情况下，仍然为国民经济节省出了六百辆汽车。实行上述措施的结果，使得一九五四年按每一百万卢布工程计算所损耗的材料，降低了百分之三点六，而在一九五五年第一季度则降低了百分之五点三。
    随着建筑工地技术设备的增加，建筑机器能力的充分利用对降低建筑造价具有重大的意义。莫斯科居住和民用建筑总局所进行的把一些分散的、小规模的机械化施工管理处和机械供应站合并为强大的机械化施工托辣斯，这样就能腾出三百部建筑机器用于其他用途。一九五四年在这方面的耗费降低了百分之六点二，而在一九五五年第一季度降低了百分之十五点二。
    在杂费支出方面也取得了十分优良的结果，一九五四年的杂费支出降低了百分之四点三，而在一九五五年第一季度则降低了百分之十八点六。
    莫斯科居住和民用建筑总局为了进一步降低建筑费用，曾制定并正在实行一个具体的组织技术措施计划，其目的是要扩大和深入工业化的建筑方法，增加装配式钢筋混凝土配件和结构的生产和使用，提高机械化水平，改进生产组织，并在劳动、材料、经费等资源的消耗方面，实行严格的节约制度。
    这些措施将贯彻到建筑组织的基层环节——工段和各小组里去，并由这些环节来加以实现。
    莫斯科的建筑工作人员在逐年地增大着工程量。一九五一年他们建筑了七十三万五千平方公尺的新住宅面积，一九五二年建筑了七十八万二千平方公尺，一九五三年建筑了八十一万三千平方公尺，一九五四年建筑了九十一万平方公尺。一九五五年的计划规定了要建筑一百万平方公尺的住宅面积。建筑工作人员已经承担了提前于十二月二十日以前完成这项任务，同时并保证进一步降低建筑的造价。
