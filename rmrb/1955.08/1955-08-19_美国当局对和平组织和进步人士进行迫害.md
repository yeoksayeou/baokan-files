    The "Charges" Levied Against the American Peace Crusade
    New York Dispatch: "The Worker Daily" reports that the US authorities are attempting to persecute the American Peace Crusade organization. US Attorney General Brownell has requested the US Government Subversive Activities Control Board to order the American Peace Crusade to register as a so-called "Communist front" organization. According to the current US "Subversive Activities Control Act," groups accepting such registration must report their activities to the government, and members of the group will be deprived of the right to work in state organs and private enterprises.
    The charges Brownell levied against the American Peace Crusade include: This organization supported and participated in various international peace gatherings, such as the Vienna World People's Peace Congress, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and the Berlin Third World Youth and Student Festival, etc.
    
    Progressive Journalist Belfrage Deported
    New York Dispatch: US authorities, under the charge of so-called "association with Communists," sentenced Cedric Belfrage, an American progressive journalist and editor of the "National Guardian" weekly, to deportation. On the 15th, Belfrage left New Jersey for England by ship. At the New Jersey dock, the US authorities dispatched a large number of police and plainclothes agents to guard against the masses holding demonstrations in support of Belfrage.
    
    Fascist Investigation Underway on Broadway in New York
    New York Dispatch: The US House Un-American Activities Committee began a so-called "discovery of Communists" fascist investigation in Broadway, the entertainment center of New York City, on the 14th. Many actors, singers, pianists, composers, writers, producers, and stage supervisors were subpoenaed by the committee.
    
    Theater actor Pollen, who was subpoenaed, issued a statement saying: "The result of the committee's interrogation in Hollywood was censorship of films and the creation of blacklists," causing people to "lose their jobs and creating a climate of fear in the relevant unions and guilds in the industry." He said, "If Mr. Walter (chairman of the Un-American Activities Committee) wants to seek the same results from the New York interrogations, it will mean that the last corner of the entertainment industry that has not yet been checked will also be checked."
    
    Paul Robeson Continues to be Barred from Leaving the Country
    Washington Dispatch: The famous American black singer Paul Robeson recently requested the Federal Court to order the State Department to cancel its arbitrary regulations and issue him a passport to travel abroad. On the 16th, the Federal Court rejected Robeson's request.
    
    Since Robeson's passport was unreasonably revoked by the State Department in August 1950, the State Department has prevented him from leaving the United States for five years, despite the fact that many countries around the world have invited Robeson to sing or participate in film production since then. The State Department told him that if he wanted to obtain a passport again, he would have to promise not to give speeches abroad and sign an affidavit stating that he was not a Communist. Robeson refused this unreasonable request. (Xinhua News Agency Dispatch)

    美国当局对和平组织和进步人士进行迫害
    加给美国和平十字军的“罪状”
    纽约消息：“工人日报”报道，美国当局正企图对美国和平十字军组织进行迫害。美国司法部长布朗纳尔要求美国政府颠覆活动管制委员会命令美国和平十字军作为所谓“共产党阵线”组织进行登记。按照美国现行的所谓“颠覆活动管制法”，接受这种登记的团体必须向政府报告它们的活动，团体的成员将被剥夺在国家机关和私人企业中工作的权利。
    布朗纳尔加给美国和平十字军的罪状有：这个组织支持和参加了各种国际和平集会，如像维也纳世界人民和平大会、亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议和柏林第三届世界青年与学生联欢节等。
    驱逐进步新闻工作者贝尔弗拉奇出境
    纽约消息：美国当局以所谓“同共产党有联系”的罪名判处把美国进步新闻工作者、“国民前卫”周刊编辑塞德里克·贝尔弗拉奇驱逐出境。十五日，贝尔弗拉奇乘轮船离开美国的新泽西前去英国。在新泽西码头上，美国当局派出了大批警察和便衣特务警戒，阻止群众举行声援贝尔弗拉奇的示威。
    在纽约百老汇进行法西斯调查
    纽约消息：美国众议院非美活动调查委员会十四日开始对纽约市娱乐中心百老汇进行所谓“发现共产党人”的法西斯调查。许多男女演员、歌唱家、钢琴家、作曲家、作家、制片人和舞台监督都受到委员会的传讯。
    受到传讯的戏剧演员波伦发表声明说：“委员会在好莱坞进行审问的结果是对电影进行审查、造黑名单”，使人们“失业，并且在这个行业有关的工会和行会中制造恐惧气氛。”他说：“如果华尔特先生（非美活动调查委员会主席）想从纽约的审问中寻找同样的结果，这将意味着娱乐界中还没有遭受检查的最后一个角落也要遭受检查了。”
    继续不准保罗·罗伯逊出国
    华盛顿消息：美国著名黑人歌唱家保罗·罗伯逊最近要求联邦法院指令国务院取消专横规定，发给他出国护照。十六日，联邦法院拒绝了罗伯逊的要求。
    自从一九五○年八月罗伯逊的出国护照被国务院无理吊销后，五年来国务院一直不让他离开美国，尽管自从那时以来全世界有许多国家邀请罗伯逊前去演唱或者参加电影拍摄工作。国务院告诉他说，如果他想再获得护照，就要答应不在国外发表演说，并且要签署不是共产党人的宣誓书。罗伯逊拒绝了这种无理的要求。（据新华社讯）
