Title: The Qiqihar Paper Mill Must Investigate Responsibility for Accidents

To the Editor:

    The Qiqihar Paper Mill had a total of 83 accidents from January to May this year, including 55 mechanical accidents and 28 personal injury accidents. These accidents resulted in a direct loss of 8,644 yuan, in addition to nearly 66 hours of machine downtime, which also affected product quality. Since June, accidents have continued to occur in the factory.

    Why are there so many accidents in this factory? The main reason is that the factory's leading staff neglect safety work. The workshop cadres also follow suit. In order to reduce and eliminate accidents, the competent departments of the factory stipulated that the time for safety education for employees in each factory should not be less than two hours per week. However, this factory only stipulates three hours per month. In practice, the workshops have not implemented this well, and these three hours are only nominal and a mere formality. Under such circumstances, some workers do not pay enough attention to safety in production. For example, on May 23, the factory finished washing the copper mesh. According to regulations, the machine should be run empty for 15 minutes and the material should only be released after obtaining permission from the person in charge of the copper mesh. However, Zhao Yujin, the worker in charge of releasing the material, released the material in less than ten minutes without contacting the person in charge of the copper mesh, and the release was both large and rapid. As a result, a copper mesh worth more than 3,000 yuan was crushed, and the machine was shut down for 12 hours.

    More seriously, this factory has also had incidents in which leading staff violated safe production procedures, resulting in accidents. The factory's third wood grinder did not apply to the Electricity Bureau for approval when starting the machine with electricity. On May 4, the Electricity Bureau notified them that they would inspect the electricity consumption. Therefore, the relevant leaders immediately held an "emergency secret meeting" and decided to say that the electricity used to start the machine was for drying the motor because it was damp. Because the electricity used for production is high-voltage, while the electricity used for drying machines is low-voltage, the workshop director instructed the workers to connect the low-voltage switch. As a result, the switch was connected incorrectly, burning out a 100-horsepower transformer and two small transformers; it was fortunate that this was not worse, as such an accident could have damaged the power plant's generating equipment and caused serious personal injury accidents.

    I believe that the leading staff of the Qiqihar Paper Mill should quickly examine and criticize the erroneous thinking of neglecting safety in production, earnestly improve their work, and immediately investigate responsibility for the accidents.

### 齐齐哈尔造纸厂必须追查发生事故的责任

　　齐齐哈尔造纸厂必须追查发生事故的责任编辑同志：
    齐齐哈尔造纸厂今年一到五月份共发生事故八十三次，其中机械事故五十五次，人身事故二十八次。这些事故直接造成的损失达八千六百四十四元，此外还使机器停止生产近六十六小时，并且影响了产品的质量。六月份以来，厂里仍然不断地发生事故。
    为什么这个厂的事故这样多呢？主要原因是厂里的领导工作人员忽视安全工作。车间干部也上行下效。工厂的主管部门为了减少和消灭事故，规定各厂对职工进行安全教育的时间每周不得少于两个钟头，而这个工厂每月只规定三个钟头，实际上各个车间还没有很好执行，这三个钟头也是有名无实，流于形式。在这种情况下，有些工人对安全生产就很不重视。如五月二十三日工厂刷洗铜网完毕。按规定要在开车空运转十五分钟，并且取得管理铜网的人员的允许后才能放料。可是，负责放料的工人赵玉金在开车不到十分钟时，没有同管铜网的人员联系就放料了，而且放的既多又猛。结果，一张价值三千多元的铜网挤坏了，还使机器停止生产十二小时。
    更严重的是，这个厂还发生过领导工作人员违反安全生产规程以致造成事故的事。这个厂第三碎木机开车用电时没有按规定报请电业局批准。五月四日，电业局通知要检查用电情况。于是有关领导人员立即开了个“紧急的秘密会议”，决定把开车用电说成是电动机潮湿进行干燥而用的电。由于生产用电是高压的，而干燥机器用电是低压的，车间主任就指使工人把低压开关接上。结果开关接错了，就烧坏了一个一百马力的变压器和两个小变压器；这还是不幸中的大幸，这样的事故还有烧坏发电厂的发电设备、并造成重大的人身事故的危险。
    我认为，齐齐哈尔造纸厂领导工作人员应该迅速检查和批判忽视安全生产的错误思想，认真地改进工作，并且立即追查发生事故的责任。
