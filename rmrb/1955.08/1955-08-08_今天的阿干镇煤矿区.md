    Today's Aganzhen Coal Mining Area
    By our reporter Kang Weizhong
    From Lanzhou, Gansu Province, take a public bus southwest along a narrow road that is almost entirely uphill for more than 20 kilometers to reach the Aganzhen Coal Mining Area.
    The Aganzhen mining area has two mines: Aganzhen Coal Mine and Shmengou Coal Mine. Both mines have a long history of mining. Locals often say, "First there was Tanhuaping, then there was Lanzhou City." Tanhuaping is the big coal mountain behind Aganzhen. Since the Ming Dynasty, the Aganzhen Coal Mining Area has been connected with the lives of the broad masses of people. However, the reactionary rulers of the past always used the rich coalfields here as a means of exploiting the people. During the years of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, bureaucratic capitalists, in order to obtain high profits, disregarded the lives and deaths of the miners and adopted extremely backward and unsafe coal mining methods such as "high fall type," "stacking type," and "residual pillar type." They adopted "series" natural ventilation, and the underground temperature was generally as high as 35 degrees Celsius or more. There were no pit pillar supports in the coal mining roadways, and some were only built with a little stone pier or a few wooden sticks. Miners working in such mines not only had to endure high heat and could not breathe in any fresh air, but also faced the danger of coal roofs, rock collapses, and gas explosions that could lead to disability and death at any time. The miners described their lives as "eating the food of the living and doing the work of the dead."
    After liberation, the local people's government took over the coal mine, which quickly restored production. However, some counter-revolutionaries, bandits, secret agents, feudal foremen, and fugitive landlords took the opportunity to sneak into the coal mining enterprises to carry out sabotage activities, and some even usurped leadership positions. After the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the democratic reform movement, a group of counter-revolutionaries and feudal foremen were arrested and dealt with, which raised the miners' class consciousness, and on this basis, production reforms were carried out, scientific management systems were gradually established, three pairs of shafts were expanded, and safety and health equipment was added. In 1954, some mines were merged and changed from local state-owned to state-owned, strengthening the direct leadership of higher authorities over the mines. In production, the enthusiasm and creativity of the miners were brought into play through labor competitions. In 1954 alone, the employees of Aganzhen Coal Mine put forward 312 rationalization proposals. The Second Coal Mining Zone of Shmengou Coal Mine put forward 74 rationalization proposals in one month, of which 16 rationalization proposals that had been adopted saved the country more than 5,000 yuan. Due to the increase in the miners' enthusiasm for production, the output of the entire mining area has been increasing year by year. The planned coal production of Shmengou Coal Mine in 1955 exceeded 27 times that of the early days of liberation; Aganzhen Coal Mine also exceeded more than 11 times.
    The underground coal reserves in the Aganzhen mining area are rich. However, the geological structure here is very complex: the coal seams are folded and intersected, faults are rampant, and the thickness varies greatly; some coal seams are also mixed with a large amount of stone. These have brought many difficulties to tunneling and coal mining work. Some particularly thick coal seams of more than four meters cannot be mined due to the existing equipment and technical conditions, and can only be left for later mining. At present, the main focus is on concentrating efforts on mining coal seams below four meters. This can greatly improve coal mining efficiency and save national resources. Since 1953, the entire mining area has been learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and promoting the "longwall" mining method, which has increased the recovery rate. For example, in the past, the old mining methods of "residual pillar type" or "high fall type" had a recovery rate of only 30 percent, while after the implementation of the "longwall" mining method, the recovery rate has gradually increased to more than 80 percent. At the same time, after the implementation of this mining method, no major accidents have occurred on the working face. Since this year, the "wooden board false roof" and "one-time full height" mining methods have also been implemented in some key mining areas, and preparations are being made to promote the "metal mesh false roof" mining method. These new mining methods can greatly extend the life of the mine and save national wealth. For example, after Shmengou Coal Mine adopted the "one-time full height" mining method, not only did the recovery rate increase to 87.5 percent, but also a lot of pit pillars were saved. Furthermore, in the past, tunneling roadways were mostly dug with hand picks, and each person could only advance 0.7 meters per day. After adopting the drilling and blasting method, it is generally possible to tunnel more than 1 meter; some mining areas have also promoted the "hollow blasting method," which has increased coal mining efficiency by 25 to 30 percent.
    In order to increase coal production, many mining areas have also promoted small-scale mechanized coal mining. In order to cooperate with the mining area's small-scale mechanization and large-scale basic construction power consumption, the Lanzhou Power Plant has also specially increased its power generation by 56 percent on the original basis, and sent it to the mining area through the Lan'a high-voltage transmission line in early February. Now, the mines have used electric power to drive water pumps for drainage, and coal in inclined shafts is hoisted by electric winches and steam winches. Some tunneling projects also use electric power to drive pneumatic drills for tunneling, and the mining areas have used electric drills for drilling and electric chutes for transporting coal. Some places have also installed local electric fans. The promotion of these small-scale mechanization has not only improved the efficiency of tunneling and coal mining, but also greatly reduced the physical labor of the miners. For example, in the past, using hand hammers for drilling could only drill 1.2 meters deep in half an hour, but after switching to electric drills, it is possible to drill 1.4 to 1.6 meters deep in 3 to 5 minutes. After the implementation of electric chute coal transportation, more than 10 porters can be reduced on a 50-meter coal mining working face, and coal transportation efficiency has also been greatly improved. After the installation of local electric fans, the effective air volume of the working face was increased, the temperature was reduced to below 20 degrees Celsius, and the hazards of underground water, fire, and gas were effectively prevented. Recently, a water spraying and dust removal system has also been established in the mine to prevent dust from flying; kerosene lamps have been abolished and replaced with mine electric lamps; and miners have been issued safety helmets and leggings to reduce bump injuries and ensure safe production. All of this shows that the working conditions of the miners are much better than in the past.
    The material and cultural lives of the miners have also been correspondingly improved. The days of "not having enough to eat, not having enough to wear, a small number of people living in broken kilns, and most people having nowhere to rely on" during the Kuomintang rule are over. Now, the miners can not only eat and dress warmly, but also the dormitories they live in are being expanded year by year. Last year alone, more than 3,000 square meters of new houses were built, and more than 10,000 square meters are planned to be built this year; a well-equipped hospital was also newly built in June.
    In order to completely change the face of this coal mine, a large-scale reconstruction project has begun. The reconstruction projects of the main transportation roadways of Shmengou and Aganzhen mines have been underway since the beginning of this year. After these two projects are completed and handed over for production next year, all underground mining areas will be connected together. At that time, all the coal produced underground will be transported by coal trucks and electric locomotives through different specifications of light railways, full car after full car, through the main roadway entrances to the ground. The transportation efficiency will be more than ten times higher than it is now, and the miners will no longer have to carry coal in back baskets in mine roadways with distances of 500 to 600 feet and steep slopes of 20 to 30 degrees. When the two huge industrial squares of the two coal mines are built, ground transportation, screening, coal loading and other equipment will become a transportation system composed of machines. After the reconstruction of the mine, ventilation fans will also send air to each mining area, ensuring the health of workers and normal production.
    The rapid development of coal mine production and construction also requires the strengthening of transportation capacity. At present, the transportation of coal produced in the mining area mainly relies on animal power and a part of automobile transportation, which can only transport more than 400,000 tons per year, and the transportation cost is also high. Therefore, the state has decided to build a railway branch line from Lanzhou to Aganzhen within this year to solve the problem of coal transportation. This railway line is more than 20 kilometers long, crosses the river three times along the way, and passes through a 100-meter-long tunnel through the entire mining area, all the way to the industrial square of the farthest Shmengou Coal Mine. This railway has recently started construction and is expected to be open to traffic before the end of the year. The completion of this railway project will play a great role in facilitating transportation between the mining area and Lanzhou City, ensuring coal for industrial construction and people's livelihood, expanding material exchanges, and changing the face of the mining area.

    今天的阿干镇煤矿区
    本报记者　康伟中
    从甘肃省兰州市乘公共汽车向西南，经过二十多公里几乎都是上坡的狭窄的公路，就到了阿干镇煤矿区。
    阿干镇矿区有两个矿——阿干镇煤矿和石门沟煤矿。这两座煤矿，开采的历史都很久远，这里的人常说：先有炭化坪，后有兰州城。炭化坪就是阿干镇后边的大煤山。从明朝以来，阿干镇煤矿区就同广大人民的生活联系在一起。但是，历代的反动统治者都是把这里丰富的煤田作为剥削人民的手段，在国民党反动统治的年代里，官僚资本家为了取得高额利润，竟不顾矿工死活，采取了极端落后的“高落式”、“堆集式”、“残柱式”等不安全的采煤方法；采用了“串连式”的自然通风，井下温度一般高达三十五度以上；挖煤巷子里没有坑柱支架，有的仅砌一点石垛或支几根木棒子。矿工们在这样的井底下工作，不仅要忍耐高热、吸不到一点新鲜的空气，并且随时都会遇到煤顶、岩石塌落和瓦斯爆炸等导致残废和死亡的危险。矿工们形容自己的生活是“吃的是阳间饭，做的是阴间活”。
    解放后，当地人民政府接收了这座煤矿，使这座煤矿迅速地恢复了生产。但一些反革命分子、土匪、特务、封建把头、逃亡地主都乘隙潜入煤矿企业里进行破坏活动，甚至有的还窃夺了领导职务。经过镇压反革命和民主改革运动后，逮捕和处理了一批反革命分子和封建把头等，提高了矿工的阶级觉悟，并在这个基础上进行了生产改革，逐步建立了科学的管理制度，还扩修了三对矿井，增添了安全卫生设备。一九五四年又合并了一些矿井，并由地方国营改为国营，加强了上级对矿井的直接领导。在生产中，通过劳动竞赛，发挥了矿工的生产积极性和创造性。一九五四年，仅阿干镇煤矿职工提出的合理化建议就有三百一十二件。石门沟煤矿第二采煤区在一个月内提出合理化建议七十四件，其中已被采纳的十六件合理化建议，就为国家节约资金五千多元。由于矿工生产积极性的提高，整个矿区的生产量逐年都在增长。石门沟煤矿一九五五年计划完成的产煤数量就超过解放初期的二十七倍；阿干镇煤矿也超过了十一倍多。
    阿干镇矿区地下煤的蕴藏量是丰富的。但是这里的地质构造却非常复杂：煤层折绉交错，断层丛生，厚薄变化很大；有的煤层里还混杂大量石头。这些给掘进和采煤工作带来了许多困难。一些在四公尺以上的特厚的煤层，根据现有的设备和技术条件，还不能开采，只有留在以后开采。目前，主要是集中力量开采那些在四公尺以下的煤层。这样就可大大提高采煤效率，也可节省国家资源。从一九五三年开始，全矿区学习苏联的先进经验，推广了“长壁式”采煤法，提高了回采率，如过去用“残柱式”或“高落式”的旧采煤法，回采率仅达到百分之三十，而推行“长壁式”采煤法后，回采率逐步提高到百分之八十以上，同时在实行这种采煤法后，在工作面上从未发生过重大的事故。从今年开始，在一些重点采煤区还实行了“木板假顶”、“一次采全高”采煤法，并正准备推行“金属网假顶”采煤法，这些新的采煤法，都可使矿井的寿命大大延长，并节约了国家财富。如石门沟煤矿采用“一次采全高”采煤法后，不仅回采率提高到百分之八十七点五，同时还节省了很多坑柱子。再如过去掘进巷道，多用手镐挖，每人每天只能前进零点七公尺，采用打眼放炮法后，普遍可掘进一公尺以上；有些采煤区还推广“空心爆炸法”，又提高采煤效率百分之二十五到三十。
    为了提高煤的产量，不少采煤区还推行了小型机械化采煤。兰州市电厂为了配合矿区小型机械化和规模巨大的基本建设用电，还特别在原有基础上提高发电量百分之五十六，并在二月上旬通过兰阿高压输电线送到了矿区。现在，矿井下已用电力带动水泵排水，斜井下的煤用电绞车、汽绞车提升，部分掘进工程也用电力带动风钻掘进，采煤区已使用电钻打眼和电溜子运煤，有的地方还安装了局部电扇。这些小型机械化的推行，不仅提高掘进和采煤的效率，而且大大减轻了矿工的体力劳动。例如过去采用手锤打眼，半个钟头只能打进一公尺二深，改用电钻打眼，在三至五分钟内就可打进一公尺四至一公尺六深。推行电溜子运煤后，在五十公尺的采煤掌子面上，就可减少十个以上的搬运工，运煤效率也大大提高了。在局部电扇安装后，增加了工作面有效风量，温度降低到二十度以下，有效地防止了井下水火和瓦斯的危害。最近，在矿井下还建立了洒水扫尘制度，防止了风尘飞扬；取消了青油灯，改用矿电灯；并给矿工发下了安全帽、绑腿带，减少了碰伤事故，保证了安全生产。这一切都说明，矿工的工作条件较之过去是好得多了。
    矿工的物质和文化生活也有了相应的提高。在国民党统治时期那种“吃不饱，穿不暖，少部分人住破窑，多数人无处靠”的日子已经过去了。现在，矿工们不但能够吃得饱穿得暖，住的宿舍也逐年都在扩建。光去年就新建房屋三千多平方公尺，今年还计划新建一万多平方公尺；六月里还新建成了一所设备齐全的医院。
    为彻底改变这个煤矿的面貌，规模巨大的改建工程已经开始。石门沟、阿干镇两矿总运输大巷的改建工程今年年初起就在进行。这两项工程在明年完工移交生产后，将把井下所有采煤区都连结在一起。那时，井下全部生产出的煤炭就会由煤车、电机车通过不同规格的轻便铁道，满车满车地通过大巷口运送到地面上来，运输效率将比现在提高十倍以上，矿工们就再不用到五、六百尺的距离和二、三十度陡坡的井巷里用背斗背煤了。当两个煤矿的两个巨大的工业广场建好以后，地面运输、筛选、装煤等设备将成为一套由机器构成的运输系统。改建后的矿井下，也将会由扇风机向每个采煤区送风，保证工人身体健康和正常生产。
    煤矿生产建设的迅速发展，也要求运输力量的加强。目前矿区产煤外运，主要依靠畜力和一部分汽车运输，全年只能运输四十多万吨，而且运输成本也高。因此，国家决定在今年内，从兰州到阿干镇修通一条铁路支线，解决煤的运输问题。这条铁路线全长二十多公里，沿途跨河三次，并通过一百公尺长的隧道贯穿整个矿区，一直通到最远的石门沟煤矿的工业广场。这条铁路已于最近施工，预计年底以前通车。这条铁路工程的完成，对于便利矿区同兰州市内的运输，保证工业建设和人民生活用煤，扩大物资交流，改变矿区面貌必将发生很大的作用。
