　　Important Development of Sino-Egyptian Friendly and Cooperative Relations

　　After full and friendly consultations, representatives of the Chinese government and representatives of the government of the Republic of Egypt signed a trade agreement and the protocol for the first agreement year between the two governments in Beijing. The Sino-Egyptian trade agreement stipulates that the two governments will do their utmost to promote and expand trade between the two countries, grant each other most-favored-nation treatment, and establish commercial representative offices in each other's countries. The signing of the Sino-Egyptian trade agreement opens up broad prospects for enhancing the friendship between the governments and peoples of China and Egypt, strengthening economic cooperation between the two countries, and developing trade relations between the two countries. It marks an important development in the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Egypt.

　　China and Egypt are both countries with abundant resources and share the common desire to increase trade and develop their respective independent and self-reliant economies. In recent years, the peoples of China and Egypt have made many efforts to promote trade and friendly relations between the two countries in order to eliminate economic backwardness and develop their independent economies. Now, the trade delegation of the government of the Republic of Egypt, led by Muhammad Abu Nuseir, Minister of Industry and Commerce of Egypt, has come to China, and China and Egypt have signed a formal trade agreement. This greatly advances the efforts of the two peoples over the past few years, enabling these efforts to proceed more smoothly on a solid foundation. The Chinese people express their warm welcome to this.

　　The peoples of China and Egypt have had many exchanges in history. However, due to the control, aggression, and oppression of foreign colonialism, the friendly exchanges between the two peoples have been greatly hindered. The Asian-African Conference provided an opportunity for China and Egypt to strengthen various contacts and enhance mutual understanding and friendship. The resolution on economic cooperation at the Asian-African Conference emphasized that participating countries should carry out economic cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit and mutual respect for national sovereignty to promote economic development in the Asian-African region. After the Asian-African Conference, Ahmed Hassani Bakour, Minister of Religious Affairs of the government of the Republic of Egypt, and Mustafa Kamel, Professor of Constitutional Law at Cairo University, came to China at our invitation and held talks with representatives of our government on increasing cultural and trade cooperation between the two countries. Representatives of China's import and export corporations also visited Egypt and signed a contract with Egypt for China to purchase 46,000 bales of Egyptian cotton. This time, at the invitation of our government, the government of the Republic of Egypt sent a trade delegation headed by Muhammad Abu Nuseir, Minister of Industry and Commerce, to visit our country to discuss and sign a trade agreement between the two governments. These activities are a concrete manifestation of our two countries sincerely implementing the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference, and also show that the achievements of the Asian-African Conference are producing practical effects.

　　The Sino-Egyptian trade agreement is full of the spirit of equality, mutual benefit, independence, and self-reliance, and it is also suitable for the specific economic conditions of the two countries. In the list of goods attached to this trade agreement, the commodities that our country can supply include not only traditional export goods, but also many industrial products, various machinery, complete sets of equipment such as textile factories, paper mills, and other goods in exchange for Egyptian cotton and other goods. On this mutually beneficial basis, our country imports Egypt's important product, cotton, while supplying Egypt with the industrial products it needs, as well as industrial equipment that imperialism has always been unwilling to supply, in order to promote Egypt's industrial construction and economic independence and self-reliance. The spirit of mutual benefit and cooperation is particularly evident in the exchange of Egyptian cotton. Egypt is a famous cotton-producing country in the world, and its main export commodity is cotton. However, due to the United States dumping its "surplus" cotton on the world market, driving down cotton prices, Egypt's cotton market has been greatly affected, and the lives of the Egyptian people have suffered undue difficulties. Our country's import of Egyptian cotton based on our own needs is beneficial to improving the lives of our people; at the same time, it enables the Egyptian people's cotton, earned through labor, to gain a market and not become a tool for imperialists to extort Egypt. Recently, after China and Egypt signed a contract for China to purchase Egyptian cotton, the Egyptian "Republic News" wrote: "Imperialist countries used to use the purchase of cotton to blackmail Egypt and as a tool to exert political pressure. Egypt now wants to end this situation." This fully illustrates the actual situation.

　　In order to develop trade between the two countries, the Sino-Egyptian trade agreement stipulates that the two governments agree to establish government commercial representative offices in each other's countries and agree to hold commodity exhibitions in each other's countries. These measures by the two governments are of great significance for promoting the development of trade between the two countries in the future. The protocol for the first agreement year stipulates the requirement that Sino-Egyptian trade should achieve import and export balance. This is the common wish of the two governments. This will greatly help consolidate and develop trade relations between China and Egypt. The protocol stipulates that the total import and export volume between China and Egypt in the first year will be 20 million pounds. This is a great advance compared to the previous Sino-Egyptian trade volume. Immediately after the signing of the trade agreement and protocol, China's import and export corporations signed contracts with the Egyptian Cotton Commission and the Egyptian Misr Company, respectively, to import 45,000 bales of cotton from Egypt. China's metal import corporation also signed an agreement with representatives of Egyptian steel importers to supply Egypt with 60,000 tons of steel. This fully proves that the Sino-Egyptian trade agreement and protocol are completely based on a solid foundation. Due to the joint efforts of China and Egypt, we can believe that the prospects for trade between the two countries are very broad.

　　The Sino-Egyptian trade agreement is the first agreement that our country has signed with an African country. It shows that strengthening mutual trust and friendly cooperation among Asian and African countries has great practical significance, and that the good desire to expand the area of peace is also a completely achievable goal. Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in his "Report on the Asian-African Conference": "Asian and African countries can already begin to help each other, and there is no doubt that this mutual assistance has broad prospects for development." It is based on this understanding that the Chinese people have always attached importance to increasing mutual contact and developing economic and cultural ties with Asian and African countries. Since the Asian-African Conference, the cooperative relations between our country and Asian and African countries have greatly increased. We are prepared to continue to develop this relationship and continue to expand the area of peace. This is entirely beneficial to consolidating world peace.

　　Both the Chinese people and the Egyptian people have their own glorious histories. Our two peoples have waged heroic struggles against foreign aggressors in order to safeguard their respective national sovereignty and independence. The Chinese people cherish very much the friendly cooperation and economic and cultural relations that have now been established with the Egyptian people. We sincerely hope that the friendly relations between China and Egypt will be further developed and consolidated on the existing basis.

### 中埃友好合作关系的重要发展

　　中埃友好合作关系的重要发展
    我国政府代表同埃及共和国政府代表经过充分友好的协商，在北京签订了两国政府间的贸易协定和第一个协定年度的议定书。中埃贸易协定规定，两国政府将尽最大的可能以促进和扩大两国间的贸易，相互给予最惠国的待遇，并彼此设立商务代表处。中埃贸易协定的签订，为增强中埃两国政府和人民间的友谊，加强两国的经济合作和发展两国的贸易关系开辟了广泛的前途。它标志着中埃两国之间友好合作关系的重要发展。
    中国和埃及都是有着丰富的物产资源的国家，并且有着增进两国贸易，发展各自独立自主经济的共同愿望。近几年来，中埃两国人民为了消除经济上的落后状态，发展两国的独立经济，曾对促进两国的贸易和友好关系作了许多努力。现在埃及共和国政府贸易代表团在埃及工商部长穆罕默德·阿卜·努赛尔的率领之下来到中国，中埃两国签订了正式的贸易协定。这就把两国人民几年来的努力大大地推进了一步，使这种努力得以在稳固的基础上更加顺利地进行。中国人民对此表示热烈的欢迎。
    中埃两国人民在历史上曾经有过很多的相互往来。但是，由于外来殖民主义的控制侵略和压迫，两国人民的友好往来曾经受到极大的阻挠。亚非会议提供了中埃两国加强各种接触的机会，增进了两国间的相互了解和友谊。亚非会议关于经济合作的决议，强调与会各国在互利和互相尊重国家主权的基础上实行经济合作，来促进亚非区域的经济发展。亚非会议结束后，埃及共和国政府宗教事务部部长艾哈迈德·哈萨尼·巴库尔和开罗大学宪法教授穆斯塔法·卡迈尔，应我国的邀请，前来访问，同我国政府代表就增进两国文化、贸易合作问题举行了会谈。我国进出口公司代表也访问了埃及，同埃及签订了关于中国购买埃及棉花四万六千包的合同。这次埃及共和国政府应我国政府的邀请，派遣以工商部长穆罕默德·阿卜·努赛尔为首的贸易代表团来我国访问，商谈并签订两国政府间的贸易协定。这些活动是我们两国真诚地执行亚非会议决议的具体表现，同时也说明亚非会议的成就，正在产生着实际的影响。
    中埃贸易协定充满了平等互利、独立自主的精神，也适合两国经济的具体情况。在这次贸易协定所附的货单中，我国可供应的商品除传统的出口货以外还有许多工业产品、各种机械、成套设备如纺织厂、造纸厂设备和其他货物以交换埃及棉花和其他货物。在这互利的基础上，我国进口了埃及的重要产品——棉花，同时供给了埃及所需要的工业产品，和帝国主义一向不愿供给的工业设备，以促进埃及的工业建设和经济上的独立自主。在交换埃及棉花方面，这种互利合作的精神尤为显著。埃及是世界出产棉花有名的国家，它出口的主要商品是棉花。但是，由于美国在世界市场上抛售它的
  “剩余”棉花，压低棉价，使埃及的棉花市场受到很大影响，使埃及人民的生活遭受到不应有的困难。我国根据自身的需要输入埃及棉花，这对改进我国人民的生活是有利的；同时这又使埃及人民劳动所得的棉花获得了市场，不致成为帝国主义者对埃及进行勒索的工具。最近，在我国同埃及签订关于中国购买埃及棉花的合同后，埃及“共和国报”写道：“帝国主义国家过去利用收购棉花来对埃及进行讹诈和作为施加政治压力的工具，埃及现在要结束这种状况。”这充分说明了实际的情况。
    为了发展两国的贸易，中埃贸易协定规定，两国政府同意相互在对方国家设立政府的商务代表处，并同意相互在对方国家举办商品展览。两国政府的这些措施，对于促进今后两国贸易的发展，具有非常重大的意义。在第一个协定年度议定书中规定了中埃间的贸易达成进出口平衡的要求。这是两国政府的共同愿望。这将大大有助于中埃两国间贸易关系的巩固和发展。议定书中规定了第一年度中埃两国的进出口总额将为二千万英镑。这同以往的中埃贸易额相比，是大大地前进了。紧接着贸易协定和议定书签订之后，中国进出口公司分别同埃及共和国棉花委员会和埃及密斯尔公司签订了自埃及进口四万五千包棉花的合同。中国五金进口公司又同埃及钢铁进口商的代表签订了供应埃及六万吨钢材的协议书。这充分证明中埃贸易协定和议定书是完全建立在巩固的基础上的。由于中埃双方的共同努力，我们可以相信，两国贸易的前景是非常广阔的。
    中埃贸易协定是我国同非洲国家签订的第一个协定。它说明亚非国家加强相互信任和友好合作有极大的现实的意义，扩大和平地区的善良愿望也是完全可以达到的目标。周恩来总理在“关于亚非会议的报告”中指出：“亚非国家已经可以开始互助，而且这种互助毫无疑义地有广阔的发展前途。”正是基于这种认识，中国人民一向重视同亚非各国增加相互接触和发展经济、文化方面的联系。在亚非会议以后，我国同亚非国家之间的合作关系已经大大增加。我们准备使这种关系继续发展，使和平区域继续扩大。这对于巩固世界和平是完全有利的。
    中国人民和埃及人民都有着各自的光辉历史。我们两国人民为维护各自国家的主权和独立，都曾对外国侵略势力进行英勇斗争。中国人民非常珍重同埃及人民现在建立起来的友好合作和经济、文化关系。我们诚恳地希望，中埃两国间的友好关系将能在现有的基础上进一步发展和巩固。
