Wuhan, Nanjing and Other Cities Achieve Success in Conserving Grain

    (Report from our newspaper) Since Wuhan City implemented the method of fixed-quantity grain supply for collective catering units such as government agencies and enterprises, initial results have been achieved.

    In June, leading members of various government agencies and organizations in Wuhan City formed inspection teams to conduct in-depth inspections at the grassroots level and held discussion meetings to exchange experiences in saving grain. As a result, the phenomena of inflated reporting, fraudulent claims, excessive purchases, hoarding, and duplicate grain supplies in various government agencies have been greatly reduced. In terms of grain consumption, the amount used in June decreased by 2.2 million jin compared to May, and the amount used in July decreased by another 1 million jin compared to June. The city's average consumption in July decreased by 17% compared to June.

    Many government agencies and organizations in Wuhan City have been able to meticulously plan and actively improve catering management and cooking methods while ensuring the principle of "eating enough without wasting." Xiehe Hospital calculated that it could save 1,000 jin of grain per month by dealing with leftover food and planning rice cooking. The City Insurance Company improved its management system, with an average grain consumption of 19 jin and 11 liang per person per month, a decrease of 4 jin and 14 liang compared to the previous month. The company's station office only requires 20.5 jin per person per month, a decrease of 6 jin and 6 liang compared to before the quota.

    In Nanjing City, employees and students in various government agencies, organizations, factories, and schools have developed a habit of saving grain. In July, the city's grain sales volume decreased by more than 8 million jin compared to March before the launch of the grain conservation campaign. The unreasonable situation of excessive grain sales in the previous months has been changed. Currently, the grain conservation campaign is being carried out among residents. More than 90% of residents in Xiangpuying and Shiba Street have held family grain consumption meetings. The revised grain consumption plans of more than 7,900 households in these two districts can save more than 130,000 jin of grain per month, an average of more than 4 jin per person per month. In Mafu Street, 169 households requested the local residents' committee to reduce the grain supply by more than 1,000 jin. Many residents have also exposed the phenomena of inflated reporting, fraudulent claims, and grain waste, and reported illegal acts such as hoarding and tax evasion of grain.

    After the comprehensive implementation of grain conservation in Tianjin City, grain sales volume continued to decline. According to statistics from the Tianjin Municipal Grain Bureau, the amount of food grain supplied to residents, the food industry, industrial grain, and livestock feed in July decreased by 9.97 million jin compared to May and 6.9 million jin compared to June.

    Workers and staff in industrial and mining enterprises in Kunming City have achieved success in conserving grain. After clarifying the significance of saving grain, workers first tried to find ways to save grain for the country in their work. Employees of the No. 2 Rice Milling Factory of Kunming Grain Company improved the inclination of the rice milling machine's sieve bed to increase the rice yield, estimating that they can increase the country's grain by 135,000 jin this year. Employees of the Dalu Sauce Garden, a brewing industry in the second district of Kunming, used corn flour instead of wheat flour to make soy sauce, saving more than 3,600 jin of wheat flour per month, reducing costs, and meeting quality standards.

    Since mid-June, various factories and mining enterprises in Kunming City have begun to purchase grain in accordance with the grain consumption plans verified by the Grain Bureau. According to preliminary statistics, the city's grain sales volume in June has decreased by more than 2.1 million jin compared to May. Currently, the atmosphere of saving and cherishing grain has gradually been established among workers, and the phenomenon of recklessly wasting grain has been significantly reduced. Clerks at the Zhonghua Restaurant in the first district of Kunming politely offered suggestions to customers who casually threw away grain and promoted the significance of saving grain to customers. Family members of workers at the Kunming Electric Wire Factory no longer used rice to feed chickens, ducks, and other livestock. When eating, they repeatedly educated their children not to throw away rice grains.

    武汉南京等市节约粮食有成绩
    本报讯　武汉市实行机关企业等集体伙食单位粮食定量供应办法以来，已取得初步效果。
    六月份，武汉市各机关团体的领导人员，组成检查组深入各基层进行检查，并召开座谈会交流节约粮食经验，因而各机关浮报冒领、多购囤积和重复供应粮食的现象大大减少。从用粮量上看，六月份较五月份减少了二百二十万斤，七月份又较六月份减少了一百万斤，全市七月份平均消费量比六月份降低百分之十七。
    武汉市很多机关团体伙食单位能在保证“吃饱不浪费”的原则下，精打细算，积极改善伙食管理和炊事操作方法。协和医院从处理剩饭、计划下米等方面，计算每月可节约一千斤粮食。市保险公司改进管理制度，平均每人每月用粮十九斤十一两，较前每月减少四斤十四两。这个公司的车站办事处每人每月只需二十点五斤，较定量前减少六斤六两。
    南京市各机关、团体、工厂、学校的职工和学生，已养成节约粮食的风气。七月份全市的粮食销售量，比节约粮食活动展开前的三月份减少八百多万斤，前几个月粮食销售过多的不合理情况已有改变。现在节约粮食运动正在居民中展开。香铺营和石坝街有百分之九十以上的居民举行了家庭用粮会议。这两个地区七千九百多户居民修订后的用粮计划，每月可节约粮食十三万多斤，平均每人每月节约四斤多。马府街有一百六十九户居民向当地居民委员会要求减少供应粮一千多斤。不少居民还揭发了浮报冒领和浪费粮食的现象，检举囤存、偷漏粮食等违法行为。
    天津市全面实行节约粮食后，粮食销售量继续下降。据天津市粮食局统计，七月份供应全市居民食粮和食品业、工业用粮、牲畜饲料等的数量，比五月份减少了九百九十七万斤，比六月份减少了六百九十万斤。
    昆明市工矿企业的职工在节约粮食方面已获得成绩。职工们明确了节约粮食的意义以后，首先在自己的工作中想办法为国家节约粮食。昆明粮食公司第二碾米厂职工，改进碾米机筛床斜度，提高出米率，估计今年可为国家增加粮食十三万五千斤。昆明第二区酿造业大陆酱园职工，用玉米粉代替面粉做酱油，每月可节约面粉三千六百多斤，并且降低了成本，质量也合乎规格。
    昆明市各厂矿企业从六月中旬起开始按照粮食局核实用粮计划购买粮食，现据初步统计，全市粮食销售量，六月份已比五月份减少了二百一十多万斤。目前，节约、珍惜粮食的风气已在职工中逐渐树立起来，随便糟蹋粮食的现象已显著减少。昆明第一区中华饭店的店员，对随便抛撒粮食的顾客，和蔼地提出意见，向顾客宣传节约粮食的意义。昆明电线厂的职工家属，已不再用米喂鸡、鸭等家畜；吃饭的时候，她们再三教育孩子，不要抛撒饭粒。
