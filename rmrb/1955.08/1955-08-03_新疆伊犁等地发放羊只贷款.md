Xinjiang Yili and Other Areas Issue Sheep Loans

The Yili, Tacheng, and Altay Special Districts, under the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture of Xinjiang Province, as well as the Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture and other areas, have begun issuing third-quarter sheep loans to help impoverished herders engage in production.

This loan totals 438,400 yuan and can be used to purchase more than 137,000 ewes with reproductive capacity; if each household is given a loan for 20 sheep, it can help 6,850 impoverished herder households establish a livelihood. Before the loan work began, local banks sent a group of staff to go deep into various pastoral areas and, together with relevant departments, resolved the issue of sheep supply.

    新疆伊犁等地发放羊只贷款
    新疆省伊犁哈萨克族自治州所属的伊犁、塔城和阿勒泰专区，以及博尔塔拉蒙古族自治州等地，已经开始发放第三季度羊只贷款，帮助贫困牧民进行生产。
    这笔贷款共四十三万八千四百多元，可以购买有繁殖能力的母羊十三万七千多只；如每户贷给二十只羊的贷款，可以帮助六千八百五十多户贫困牧民建立起家园。贷款工作开始以前，各地银行派出一批工作人员深入到各个牧区，并同有关部门研究解决了羊只供应问题。
