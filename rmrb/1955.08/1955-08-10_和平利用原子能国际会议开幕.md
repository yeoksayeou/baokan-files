    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, August 9th: According to a resolution of the Ninth United Nations General Assembly on December 4, 1954, the International Scientific and Technical Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy opened on August 8th at the Palais des Nations in Geneva. The task of the conference participants is to exchange experiences in the peaceful use of atomic energy, thereby contributing to easing international tensions and strengthening trust between countries.
    More than a thousand delegates from seventy-two countries, including the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian Republic, the Byelorussian Republic, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, India, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Japan, Austria, Burma, Egypt, Indonesia, and Italy, are participating in the conference. More than two thousand scientific works completed by scientists from thirty-nine countries and the United Nations specialized agencies will be submitted to the conference for study.
    The conference opened at 10:45 local time, and the conference chairman, Mr. Bhabha, invited the President of the Swiss Confederation, Mr. Petitpierre, to speak.
    President Petitpierre, on behalf of the Swiss government authorities, welcomed the participants to the conference. Mr. Petitpierre said: "You are gathered here to pool knowledge, exchange experiences, and jointly study the use of atomic energy for the benefit of mankind, opening up new and broad possibilities for the struggle to prevent and treat diseases and improve the welfare of the people. In doing so, you are participating in an action embodying goodwill, an action that is developing and whose goal is to ease the divisions and contradictions that have been threatening the world. Thanks to the initiative of the United Nations, you will exchange your secrets and discoveries instead of suspiciously keeping them to yourselves. This joint effort is not only for the benefit of your countries but also for the happiness of all mankind, with the aim of ensuring universal progress for all without exception. I believe that this effort is very promising and has reason to inspire confidence."
    Mr. Petitpierre expressed his firm belief that the conference would set an example of cooperation in achieving objectives conducive to the cause of peace.
    Next, the Chairman invited United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld to address the meeting.
    Mr. Hammarskjöld emphasized the particularly significant importance of the conference. He said that although the conference was organized on a scientific basis, it would have considerable consequences—"not only scientific but also economic, social, and political consequences."
    Mr. Hammarskjöld emphasized: "It is incorrect to say that this conference has no political significance." He said: "I believe that the mutual exchange of scientific material will create mutual trust. I believe that the results of the discussion will make mankind aspire not to war, but to peace."
    After Mr. Hammarskjöld's address, the conference chairman, Mr. Bhabha, announced that the conference had received congratulatory telegrams from the heads of government of the four major powers and the head of government of India. These congratulatory telegrams were read out at the meeting and were greeted with warm applause.
    Subsequently, the conference chairman, Mr. Bhabha, delivered the opening address. He pointed out that the mutual exchange of experience by scientists in the peaceful use of atomic energy is of great significance to mankind. He spoke about the prospects that the peaceful use of atomic energy opens up for mankind, about the significance of atomic energy in solving a series of economic problems, and called for international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy.
    Mr. Bhabha said: "There is reason to expect that, due to the great improvement in the political situation that has recently emerged, all obstacles in the path of international cooperation will gradually disappear. We hope that this improvement in the political situation will continue to develop."
    The first meeting was then adjourned.
    At the afternoon meeting, the needs of the world for energy resources were discussed. The conference heard reports by British scientists Robinson and Daniel on "The World's Need for New Sources of Power," by American scientist Mason on "Economic Development and the Need for Power," by Czechoslovak scientist Ševčík on "Prospects for the Development of Power Production in Czechoslovakia and the Role of Atomic Energy in Peaceful Construction," and many other reports.

    和平利用原子能国际会议开幕
    新华社九日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：根据第九届联合国大会一九五四年十二月四日的决议而召开的和平利用原子能国际科学技术会议，在八月八日在日内瓦国联大厦开幕了。会议参加者的任务是：互相交换和平使用原子能方面的经验，从而对缓和国际紧张局势和加强国与国之间的信任作出贡献。
    参加会议的，有苏联、乌克兰共和国、白俄罗斯共和国、美国、英国、法国、加拿大、印度、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、南斯拉夫、日本、奥地利、缅甸、埃及、印度尼西亚、意大利等七十二个国家的一千多个代表。三十九个国家的科学家以及联合国专门机构所完成的二千多种科学著作将提交会议研究。
    会议在当地时间十时四十五分开幕，会议主席巴巴请瑞士联邦主席彼蒂彼爱讲话。
    彼蒂彼爱主席代表瑞士政府当局对参加会议的人表示欢迎。彼蒂彼爱说：各位在这里聚会是为了汇集知识，交流经验，共同研究利用原子能来造福人类，为防治疾病和提高人民的福利的斗争打开新的、广阔的可能性。你们这样做，是在参与一个体现着善良意志的行动，这个行动正在发展，它的目标是要缓和到现在一直威胁着世界的分歧和矛盾。由于联合国的倡议，你们将交流自己的秘密和发现，而不再互相猜忌地把它们保留起来。这种共同努力不仅为了你们这些国家的利益，而且也为了全人类的幸福，其目的在于保证对任何人也不应有例外的普遍进步。我觉得：这种努力是很有前途的，是有理由令人信任的。
    彼蒂彼爱表示深信会议会作出为达到有利于和平事业的目的而实行合作的榜样。
    接着，主席请联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德致词。
    哈马舍尔德着重指出会议具有特别重大的意义。他说，虽然这次会议是在科学基础上组织起来的，但是它将发生相当重大的后果——“不仅是科学方面，而且是经济、社会和政治方面的后果”。
    哈马舍尔德强调指出：“有人说这次会议没有政治意义，这是不对的。”他说：“我相信：相互交换科学材料会造成相互信任。我相信：讨论的结果会使人类向往的不是战争，而是和平。”
    在哈马舍尔德致词后，会议主席巴巴宣布会议接到了四大国政府首脑以及印度政府首脑的贺电。这些贺电在会上宣读时赢得了热烈的掌声。
    随后，会议主席巴巴致开幕词。他指出：科学家们在和平利用原子能方面互相交换经验对人类是有巨大意义的。他谈到和平利用原子能给人类打开的远景，谈到原子能对解决一系列的经济问题的意义，并且号召在和平利用原子能方面进行国际合作。
    巴巴说：人们有根据这样期待：由于不久前出现的政治形势的大大改善，国际合作道路上的所有障碍会逐渐消失。我们希望这种政治情况的改善继续发展下去。
    第一次会议至此休会。
    在下午会议上，讨论了全世界对能力资源的需要问题。会议听取了英国科学家罗宾逊和丹尼尔的报告“世界对新的能力来源的需要”、美国科学家麦逊的报告“经济发展和对能力的需要”、捷克斯洛伐克科学家谢夫切克的报告“捷克斯洛伐克能力生产发展的前景和原子能在和平建设方面的作用”以及其他许多报告。
