In the past year, thanks to the extensive publicity and education work and the complex organizational work carried out by the Party committees and governments at all levels in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee on the issue of junior high school and higher primary school graduates engaging in productive labor; and also thanks to the political and ideological education strengthened by schools and teachers for students, especially labor education for graduating classes, the erroneous views in society and among students that belittle manual labor, manual laborers, are unwilling to engage in industrial and agricultural production labor, and believe that there is no way out without further education have been somewhat changed. As a result, millions of higher primary school and junior high school graduates have been put into the production front, playing and are playing a positive role. This is a great achievement.

However, we should see that this summer, more than 570,000 junior high school graduates and 2,360,000 higher primary school graduates nationwide will not be able to continue their studies, and there are also some students who failed to get into school or find a job in previous years and are seeking solutions to employment or study problems. Therefore, recently, like the previous two summers, a tense psychology of worrying about the enrollment and employment of middle and primary school graduates has emerged in society, and there are some misconceptions and dissatisfaction among many people. Some people still complain that the government has not run enough schools and cannot solve the problem of their children's education. Some young students still look down on manual labor and manual laborers, hoping to continue their studies and unwilling to work, let alone farm. Some parents not only fail to give their children correct education on the issue of further education, but instead stimulate them with wrong attitudes. This certainly shows that the exploiting class ideology of belittling manual labor and manual laborers has its long-term historical roots and is not easy to eliminate in a short period of time; on the other hand, it also shows that our publicity and education work has been done poorly, and some places have been satisfied with last year's achievements since this year, and have relaxed their publicity work, which is not as tight as last year, which is very bad and should be corrected. Party committees and governments at all levels must strengthen publicity and education work in this regard, and especially seize the current opportunity, combine it with the publicity of the first Five-Year Plan, repeatedly explain the national policy, further carry out the education of labor glory, and combine it with the actual situation to criticize various erroneous ideas that belittle manual labor and manual laborers. The "Publicity Outline on Higher Primary School and Junior High School Graduates Engaging in Labor Production" issued by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on May 22, 1954, is still the main basis for publicizing this issue.

The first Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of our country, which was recently adopted by the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, has stipulated the development plan for general school education in the next five years: high school enrollment of 1.08 million people, and the number of high school students in school in 1957 will reach 724,000, an increase of about 1.8 times compared with 1952. Junior high school plans to enroll 6,037,000 people, and the number of junior high school students in school in 1957 will reach 3,983,000, an increase of 78.6% compared with 1952. Higher primary school enrollment will be about 26.95 million people, and the number of higher primary school students in school in 1957 will reach 12.17 million, an increase of 109.2% compared with 1952. According to this development plan, the state's investment in general education in the next five years, including the funding for training teachers, accounts for 5.54% of the state's total budget (excluding higher education and professional education funding). The proportion of education funding in the state's total budget is so large, which is impossible for any capitalist country to do. Only socialist-type countries can do it. This shows how much our country values and cares about the education of the new generation.

However, some people do not understand the above situation and always ask the government to run more middle and primary schools to meet their requirements. It should be known that the economy is the foundation of national construction, and industry, especially heavy industry, is the foundation of economic construction. Therefore, the first Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of our country focuses on the development of heavy industry. Cultural and educational undertakings can only develop accordingly on the basis of economic development. Our education construction should follow this policy. We should not require the state to make more investment in education construction; otherwise, it will inevitably reduce investment in economic construction, postpone the speed of industrialization, and violate the long-term interests of the state and the people. This is obviously wrong and impermissible.

In addition, some people say: Since so many junior high schools and high schools cannot be run, why develop so many higher primary schools and junior primary schools? This statement is still the old view that "studying is only for further education." They do not understand that the socialist revolution is to liberate the productive forces and improve the productive forces. To improve the productive forces, it is necessary to improve the cultural level of the working people. At the same time, improving the cultural level of the people is one of the fundamental goals of the socialist revolution. Socialist construction requires all members of socialist society, whether workers or peasants, to receive the necessary education and become cultured and educated people in order to engage in productive labor better and more efficiently. With the development of production, compulsory education will be implemented in the future. According to the needs of the state, young students who have completed middle and primary school education should engage in industrial or agricultural production labor or other construction work, except for a few who continue their studies. The view that workers who work and peasants who farm can be uneducated and do not need to have culture, and should not engage in industrial and agricultural production after graduating from primary and secondary schools, is obviously wrong. Today's higher primary schools and junior high schools are not too many, but too few. The reason why the state cannot make greater development in middle and primary schools today is not that it is not needed, but because it is currently impossible to allocate more manpower, material resources, and financial resources.

Some people also say: Since the government calls on junior high school and higher primary school graduates to engage in productive labor, why doesn't the government take responsibility for introducing them to jobs? Some people also say: Why can't everyone have a job in building socialism? These are all unanalyzed statements. First of all, middle and primary school graduates whose families are in rural areas should generally not have the so-called "employment" problem. These young students were born in rural areas, and when they graduate from middle and primary schools, if there are no ideological obstacles, they can completely return to the countryside and participate in agricultural production labor. At present, rural areas are vigorously developing the agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual assistance and cooperation, and need to absorb a large number of young students with certain cultural and scientific knowledge and political awareness to participate in agricultural production and mutual assistance and cooperation movements. The capacity of agricultural production for middle and primary school graduates is very large, and the current demand is very large, and the future demand will be even greater. Therefore, it should not be a problem for a large number of middle and primary school graduates from rural areas to return to the countryside. If there is still a problem, it is that some of these young students are influenced by the exploiting class ideology of belittling manual labor and manual laborers left over from the old society. These young people should see that a high tide of socialist transformation movement will appear in rural areas of our country, and after the completion of socialist transformation, a prosperous and happy socialist new countryside will appear before our eyes. Young students who devote themselves to such a great socialist transformation movement have infinitely bright and far-reaching prospects. Of course, in cities, employment for middle and primary school graduates is not as easy as in rural areas. But it should be seen that since liberation, the state has solved the employment problem for a large number of people with the restoration and development of the economy. It is just that the time of the founding of the new China is still short, and it is impossible to completely solve the employment problem in cities immediately. If the state uses the method of dispersing economic forces to take over everyone's occupation, then the development of industry will be frustrated. It must be pointed out that the employment problem for some middle and primary school graduates whose families are in cities is currently difficult. But it should also be seen that with the increasing development of industry and commerce, the employment situation of junior high school and higher primary school graduates will gradually improve. At present, students who graduate in cities, if they cannot pass the school entrance examination or find a job, should study on their own and wait for the opportunity to be employed. On this issue, the Communist Youth League organizations in various places should actively organize and help them do a good job in self-study, or help them transfer to rural areas to participate in production and work.

There is no doubt that the young students educated and cultivated by the Party and the government in recent years have the idea of loving the motherland and loving socialism, and can actively support the great plan of national production and construction. The reason why some of them are unwilling to engage in industrial and agricultural production labor is either because they are influenced by the exploiting class ideology of belittling manual labor and manual laborers left over from the old society, or because they do not understand the national policy. If the above-mentioned reasons are explained to them clearly, it is believed that these young students can overcome those erroneous ideas and can abide by the national policy.

In addition to continuing to strengthen publicity and education work, various places should also make appropriate organizational arrangements for young students who cannot continue their studies. Party committees and governments at all levels should conduct specific research with relevant units based on local conditions to properly resettle them. In some places, there is a mentality of relying on the central government, attempting to rely on the central government to solve the employment problem of middle and primary school graduates in various places. There are so many middle and primary school graduates across the country, and it is obviously impossible to rely on the central government to solve their problems. The central government will certainly do its best to help local governments solve problems, but it mainly relies on local governments to find solutions on their own. Various places should pay special attention to vigorously mobilizing and organizing them to participate in agricultural production labor. Parents of middle and primary school students who cannot continue their studies should also find ways to find jobs for their children and should not completely rely on the government.

Doing a good job in the work of mobilizing and organizing junior high school and higher primary school graduates who cannot continue their studies to engage in labor production is a complex ideological work and a complex organizational work. We must not be satisfied with the existing achievements, we must overcome complacency and relaxation, and further strive to do this work well.

### 必须做好动员组织中小学毕业生从事生产劳动的工作

    必须做好动员组织中小学毕业生从事生产劳动的工作
    过去一年，由于各地党委和政府根据中央的指示，对初中和高小毕业生从事生产劳动的问题，进行了广泛的宣传教育工作和复杂的组织工作；也由于各级学校和教师对学生加强了政治思想教育，特别是对应届毕业班进行了劳动教育，在社会上和学生中间那种轻视体力劳动、轻视体力劳动者、不愿从事工农业生产劳动和认为不升学就没有出路等等的错误看法，是有所改变的。从而使数以百万计的高小和初中毕业生投入了生产战线，发挥了和正在发挥着积极的作用。这是一个很大的成绩。
    但是，我们应该看到，今年暑假全国将有五十七万余初中毕业生和二百三十六万高小毕业生不可能升学，还有一些往年没有考上学校或者没有找到职业的学生，都要求解决就业或学习问题。因此，最近在社会上又像前两年暑期一样，出现了一种为中、小学毕业生的升学和就业问题着急的紧张心理，在不少的人当中还有一些错误认识和不满情绪。有些人仍然抱怨政府办学校办少了，解决不了他们的子女升学问题。有些青年学生仍然看不起体力劳动和体力劳动者，希望升学，不愿做工，更不愿种地。有些家长对子女的升学问题，不但没有给以正确的教育，反而以错误的态度来刺激他们。这固然说明了轻视体力劳动和轻视体力劳动者的剥削阶级思想有它的长期的历史根源，是不容易在短期内清除的；另一方面，也说明了我们的宣传教育工作还做得很差，今年以来有些地方满足于去年的成绩，对宣传工作有些松劲，不如去年抓得紧，这是很不好的，应该予以纠正。各地党委和政府必须加强这方面的宣传教育工作，特别应该抓紧当前这一时机，结合第一个五年计划的宣传，反复解释国家的政策，进一步进行劳动光荣的教育，并结合实际情况批判各种轻视体力劳动、轻视体力劳动者的错误思想。一九五四年五月二十二日中共中央宣传部发布的“关于高小和初中毕业生从事劳动生产宣传提纲”，仍然是当前宣传这一问题的主要依据。
    最近第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议所通过的我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，已经规定五年内普通学校教育的发展计划：高中招生一百零八万人，一九五七年高中在校学生数将达到七十二万四千人，比一九五二年约增长一点八倍。初级中学计划招生六百零三万七千人，一九五七年初中在校学生将达到三百九十八万三千人，比一九五二年增长百分之七十八点六。高小招生二千六百九十五万人左右，一九五七年高小在校学生将达到一千二百一十七万人左右，比一九五二年增长百分之一百○九点二。按照这样的发展计划，五年内，国家对普通教育事业的投资，包括培养师资经费在内，占国家总预算的百分之五点五四（高等教育和专业教育经费不在内）。教育经费在国家总预算中占这样大的比例，这是任何资本主义国家所办不到的，只有社会主义类型的国家才能办到。这说明我们的国家是如何重视和关怀新生一代的教育。
    但是有些人不明白上述情况，总是要求政府再多办些中、小学以满足他们的要求。应该知道，经济是国家建设的基础，而工业特别是重工业又是经济建设的基础。因此，我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，特别着重发展重工业。文化教育事业只能在经济发展的基础上作相应的发展。我们的教育建设就应该遵循这条方针。我们不应该要求国家必须在教育建设方面再作更多的投资；否则就势必要削减经济建设投资，就要推迟工业化的速度，就要违背国家和人民的长远利益。这显然是错误的。当然也是不许可的。
    另外有些人说：既然不能举办那么多的初中和高中，为什么要发展那么多的高小和初小呢？这种说法还是“读书只是为了升学”的老观点。他们不了解，社会主义革命，就是要解放生产力，提高生产力。要提高生产力，就要提高劳动人民的文化水平。同时，提高人民的文化水平，又是社会主义革命的根本目的之一。社会主义建设要求社会主义社会的所有成员不论是工人也好，农民也好，都要受到必要的教育，都变成有文化、有教养的人，以便更好地更有效率地从事生产劳动。随着生产的发展，将来还要实行普及义务教育。根据国家需要，受完中、小学教育的青年学生，除少数升学外，其余就应该从事工业或农业生产劳动或其他建设工作。那种认为做工的工人和种地的农民，可以不受教育，不需要有文化，在中小学毕了业，就不应该去从事工农业生产的看法，显然是错误的。今天的高小、初中不是太多了，还是太少了。国家今天所以不能对中、小学作更大的发展，并不是说不需要，而是因为目前还不可能拿出更多的人力、物力和财力。
    还有些人说：政府既然号召初中和高小毕业生从事生产劳动，那末政府又为什么不负责给他们介绍工作？又有些人说：建设社会主义，为什么还不能作到人人都有工作？这都是缺乏分析的说法。首先，家在农村的中、小学毕业生，一般不应有所谓“就业”问题。这些青年学生生在农村，当他们在中小学毕业以后，如果没有思想障碍，他们完全可以回到农村，参加农业生产劳动。目前农村正在大力开展以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动，需要大量吸收有一定文化科学知识和政治觉悟的青年学生参加农业生产和互助合作运动。农业生产对于中、小学毕业生的容纳量是十分巨大的，现在需要量很大，以后的需要量更大。因而大批来自农村的中、小学毕业生回到农村去是不应当有问题的。如果说还有问题，那就是这些青年学生中还有些人受着旧社会遗留下来的轻视体力劳动和轻视体力劳动者的剥削阶级思想的影响。这些青年应该看到，我国农村将要出现社会主义改造运动的高潮，在完成社会主义改造之后，一个繁荣、幸福的社会主义的新农村就会展现在我们眼前。青年学生投身到这样伟大的社会主义改造运动中去，前途是无限光明远大的。当然，在城市中，中、小学毕业生就业目前还不像农村那么容易。但应该看到解放以来国家已经随着经济的恢复和发展，解决了大批人的就业问题。只是因为新中国成立的时间还短，还不可能马上就完全解决城市中的就业问题。如果国家用分散经济力量的方法把每个人的职业都包下来，那末，工业的发展就要受到挫折。必须指出，家在城市的中、小学毕业生中有一部分人目前的就业问题是有一定困难的。但是也要看到，随着工商业的日益发展，初中和高小毕业生的就业情况，也会逐步改善的。目前城市毕业的学生，如果既考不上学校，又找不到职业，那就应该进行自学，等待机会就业。在这一问题上，各地青年团组织应该积极组织和帮助他们做好自学的工作，或者帮助他们转到农村参加生产和工作。
    几年来，党和政府教育培养出来的青年学生，毫无疑问是具有热爱祖国、热爱社会主义的思想的，是能积极拥护国家生产建设的伟大的计划的。他们当中有些人所以不愿从事工农业生产劳动，或者是由于受了旧社会遗留下来的轻视体力劳动、轻视体力劳动者的剥削阶级的思想的影响，或者是由于不了解国家的政策。如果把上面的道理对他们讲清楚了，相信这些青年学生是能克服那些错误的思想的，是能够遵守国家的政策的。
    各地除了继续加强宣传教育工作之外，对不能升学的青年学生还要作适当的组织安排工作。各级党委、政府应根据当地的情况，组织有关单位进行具体研究，妥善地安置他们。有的地方，存在着依赖中央的思想，企图靠中央来解决各地中、小学毕业生的就业问题。全国有这么多的中、小学毕业生，如果都要靠中央来解决他们的问题，那显然是不可能的。中央当然要尽力帮助地方解决问题，但主要还是靠地方自行想办法。各地应当特别注意大力动员和组织他们去参加农业生产劳动。不能升学的中、小学生的家长也应给自己的子女想办法，找职业，不能完全依赖政府。
    做好不能升学的初中和高小毕业生从事劳动生产的工作是一件复杂的思想工作，也是一件复杂的组织工作。我们决不能满足于已有的成绩，必须克服自满和松劲情绪，进一步努力把这一工作做好。
