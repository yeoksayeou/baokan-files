Xinjiang Petroleum Company's Dushanzi Mining Area has established its first compressor station to increase oil well production. The compressors in the compressor station can inject large amounts of air into the oil wells, allowing the crude oil underground to rise to the surface under air pressure. The first oil well tested with this method saw its production increase by more than two times compared to before, and the production of the two oil wells currently being tested has also increased.

The establishment of a compressor station is an important suggestion made by Soviet experts to increase the production of old oil wells. It can not only increase the oil production of old oil wells, but also turn oil wells that originally used pumping units into self-flowing wells.

Currently, technicians and oil extraction workers at the oil field are continuing to test and expand the use of this method under the guidance of Soviet experts. (Xinhua News Agency)

    新疆石油公司建立压缩机站
    新疆石油公司独山子矿区为提高油井产量建立了第一座压缩机站。压缩机站里的压缩机能把大量的空气注进油井，使井下的原油受空气的压力而升到井面。用这个办法试验的第一口油井产量比原来提高了两倍多，正在试验的两口油井产量也有所提高。
    建立压缩机站是苏联专家提出的对提高旧油井产量的一项重要建议。它不仅可以使旧油井的出油量提高，并使原来安装抽油机抽油的油井变成自喷井。
    现在油田上的技术人员和采油技术工人正在苏联专家指导下，继续试验和扩大这个办法的使用范围。　（新华社）
