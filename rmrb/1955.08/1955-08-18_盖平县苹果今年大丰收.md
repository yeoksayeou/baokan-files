    Gaiping County Apple Harvest This Year
    Gaiping County, Liaoning Province, which is famous for its apple production, has achieved another bumper harvest this year. According to a recent survey, the total output of the county can reach over 128.8 million jin, an increase of 20.8 percent compared to 1954, and an increase of more than 43 percent compared to 1953. At present, early-ripening summer apples such as Huang Kui have been put on the market in large quantities. Late-ripening autumn apples have transitioned from the sour stage to the sweet stage.
    This year, the output of summer apples in Gaiping County not only increased by more than 12 percent compared to 1954, but also the quality of the apples is good and the size is large, with only eighty apples needed to fill a basket (it was one hundred and twenty in 1954). Therefore, the export rate of apples has also doubled compared to 1954. As of July 28, 620,000 jin of apples have been exported, and the national export plan can be overfulfilled this year.

    盖平县苹果今年大丰收
    盛产苹果的辽宁省盖平县，今年又获得大丰收。据最近调查，全县总产量可达到一亿二千八百多万斤，比一九五四年增产百分之二十点八，比一九五三年增产百分之四十三以上。目前，早熟的黄奎等伏苹果已大量上市。晚熟的秋苹果已由酸期到甜期。
    盖平县今年伏苹果的产量不仅比一九五四年增产了百分之十二以上，而且苹果的质量好，个儿大，八十个即可装满一筐（一九五四年是一百二十个）。因而，苹果的出口率也比一九五四年提高了一倍。到七月二十八日统计，已出口的苹果达六十二万斤，今年可超额完成国家出口计划。
