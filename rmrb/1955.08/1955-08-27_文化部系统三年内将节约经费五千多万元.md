Xinhua News Agency, August 25th: The Ministry of Culture and its affiliated units, in accordance with the spirit of comprehensive economization, have determined that in the last three years of the First Five-Year Plan, they will save the state over 56 million yuan in expenses while completing the established development plans.

　　In terms of capital construction within the Ministry of Culture system, a total of over 43 million yuan can be saved. To save on capital construction investment, the Ministry of Culture has re-examined the capital construction plan, adjusted and reduced some capital construction projects based on the principles of "not building what is not necessary," "postponing what should be postponed," and "fully utilizing existing buildings and equipment." For example, in accordance with the spirit of overall consideration, the construction of a printing and binding factory was postponed, and existing binding production cooperatives were fully utilized. In terms of reducing costs, the Ministry of Culture system resolutely implements the new standards stipulated by the state; and has stipulated new cost standards for cinemas and theaters that are generally reduced by about one-third compared to past costs; this will save a total of 4.97 million yuan. The Ministry of Culture stipulates that future construction of cinemas and theaters should adhere to the principles of small-scale, practicality, and simplicity, and opposes blindly pursuing large-scale and luxury. In accordance with the spirit of saving money while further meeting the cultural needs of the masses, the Ministry of Culture plans to make greater use of auditoriums and clubs in urban government agencies and mass organizations in the future to show movies and perform plays, and to give full play to the role of cultural and artistic undertakings run by the masses. Some newly established units of the Ministry of Culture are also implementing measures to save on equipment. Some equipment that was originally planned to be ordered from abroad has now been changed to be ordered domestically.

　　After such savings, in addition to turning over the saved funds of more than 56 million yuan to the state, the Ministry of Culture has also been approved by the State Council to use a portion of the saved funds to build a new film studio in the inland, so as to make the distribution of film studios more reasonable.

　　In addition, the Ministry of Culture also plans to take measures such as enterprise-izing cultural undertakings, reducing film production costs, and disposing of stockpiled materials to save expenses. According to preliminary calculations, under the premise of ensuring quality, film costs alone can generally be reduced by 4% in 1955. It is also planned to reduce it by 10% to 15% in 1956.

　　文化部系统三年内将节约经费五千多万元
    新华社二十五日讯　文化部和所属单位根据全面节约精神，确定在第一个五年计划的后三年中，在完成既定事业计划的前提下，给国家节省经费五千六百多万元。
    在文化部系统的基本建设方面，共可节约四千三百多万元。为了节省基本建设投资，文化部已根据可不建的不建、应缓建的缓建、充分利用现有房屋和设备的原则，重新核定了基本建设计划，调整和削减了一些基本建设项目。如根据统筹兼顾的精神，缓建了一所印刷装订厂，而充分利用现有的装订生产合作社。在降低造价方面，文化部系统坚决执行国家规定的新标准；并规定了比过去造价一般降低三分之一左右的影院、剧场造价新标准；这样共可节约四百九十七万元。文化部规定，今后新建影院、剧场应以小型、实用、朴素为原则，反对盲目追求大型和华丽。根据既节约还要进一步满足群众文化生活要求的精神，文化部准备在今后多利用城市机关、群众团体中可以利用的礼堂和俱乐部，放映电影和演戏，并充分发挥群众举办的文化艺术事业的作用。目前文化部的一些新建单位还实行了节约设备的措施。有一些原来计划从国外订购的设备，现已改在国内订购。
    经过这样的节约，文化部除可给国家上缴节省的经费五千六百多万元外，还经国务院批准，用节约下来的一部分经费，在内地增建一所电影制片厂，以使制片厂的分布状况更加合理。
    此外，文化部还准备采取文化事业企业化、降低影片制作成本和处理积压物资等措施，来节省经费。根据初步计算，在保证质量的前提下，仅影片成本一项，一九五五年一般可以降低百分之四。一九五六年还准备降低百分之十到百分之十五。
