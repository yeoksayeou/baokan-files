Xinhua News Agency, August 30th: Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, hosted a banquet at noon on the 30th to entertain the Japanese Diet Members' Delegation to the Soviet Union.

　　During the luncheon, Nan Hanchen said in his speech that Sino-Japanese trade has developed to a certain extent in recent years, but the extent of its development is far from what we had hoped for. China's door to foreign trade is wide open, but Japan's foreign trade is still subject to foreign interference and obstruction. This is the key to the insufficient development of Sino-Japanese trade. Nan Hanchen added that without foreign trade, Japan would encounter difficulties in its economy that would be difficult to overcome. China is precisely the country with which a large amount of trade can be conducted. If Japan and China cooperate economically, its difficulties can be considerably resolved. He pointed out that with the increasing development of China's economic construction and the increasing purchasing power of the people, the prospects for Sino-Japanese trade are very broad. However, this prospect can only be realized if the Japanese people themselves control the key to foreign trade and are able to be independent.

　　Kitamura Tokutaro, head of the first Japanese Diet Members' Delegation to the Soviet Union, also delivered a speech at the banquet, expressing his gratitude for Nan Hanchen's "cordial discussion" and "advice." He said that in order to solve its economic difficulties, Japan has indeed had to find a way out through foreign trade. China has great purchasing power and great trade strength. Japan will not be able to solve its difficulties without cooperating with China. He cited an example: "In our neighboring country of China, there are abundant industrial raw materials, but we buy them from the distant Western Hemisphere, which is very unreasonable." Kitamura Tokutaro also stated: "We will definitely work hard to remove obstacles on the road of Sino-Japanese trade and to open Japan's door as much as possible."

　　Among those present at the luncheon were Lei Renmin, Li Zhuchen, and Ji Chaoding, Vice-Chairmen of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and its members, Liao Chengzhi, member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, Chen Hansheng, Vice-President, and the heads of China's import and export corporations.

　　Xinhua News Agency, August 30th: Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, held a banquet on the evening of the 30th to entertain the Japanese Diet Members' Delegation to the Soviet Union.

　　President Zhang Xiruo first gave a welcoming speech to the guests at the banquet. He said that the Chinese people have always advocated peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between countries. Friendly exchanges between the people of all countries, including direct contact between members of parliament, are helpful in enhancing mutual understanding and cooperation. It is believed that this visit of the Japanese Diet Members' Delegation to the Soviet Union and its transit through China will help enhance mutual understanding and further friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese people and between the Soviet and Japanese people.

　　Kitamura Tokutaro, head of the first Japanese Diet Members' Delegation to the Soviet Union, and Nozoe Masaru, head of the second delegation, then spoke successively. Representatives of parliamentarians from various Japanese parties also spoke in turn. They unanimously thanked the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs for its good arrangements and warm reception during their transit through China. They also expressed their intention to work hard to promote friendly cooperation, economic exchanges, and cultural exchanges between the people of China and Japan. They believe that the normalization of relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and between Japan and China is not only fully in line with the common interests of the people of Japan, the Soviet Union, and China, but also greatly helpful to peace in Asia and the world.

　　Among those present at the banquet tonight were Zhou Gengsheng, Chen Hansheng, Hu Yuzhi, Qian Duansheng, and Luo Longji, Vice-Presidents of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, Liao Chengzhi, member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Dequan, President of the Red Cross Society of China, Lei Renmin, Vice-Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and Xia Yan, Wu Yunfu, Ji Chaoding, Lu Xuzhang, Cao Mengjun, Mei Ru'ao, and Hu Lansheng.

　　Japanese people in Beijing, Kameda Tougo, Kaneko Kenta, and Nakamura Kanyaemon also attended the banquet.

　　南汉宸张奚若分别招待日国会议员访苏团
    新华社三十日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会主席南汉宸在三十日中午设宴招待日本国会议员访苏团。
    在午宴间，南汉宸致词说，几年来中日贸易有了一定发展，但是，它开展的程度还远不如我们所希望的那样。中国对外贸易的大门是大开的，可是日本对外贸易还受到外国的干涉和阻挠。这是中日贸易没有得到充分发展的关键所在。南汉宸又说，没有对外贸易，日本在经济上将碰到很难克服的困难，中国正是可以进行大量贸易的国家，如果日本和中国在经济上进行合作，它的困难当可以得到相当的解决。他指出，随着中国经济建设的日益发展和人民购买力的日益提高，中日贸易前途是非常广阔的。但是，只有日本人民自己掌握了对外贸易的大门钥匙并能自主，这个前途才有可能实现。
    日本国会议员访苏团第一团长北村德太郎也在宴会上致词，对南汉宸的“亲切叙谈”和“忠告”表示感谢。他说，日本为了解决经济上的困难，确实不得不从对外贸易方面找出路。中国有很大的购买力，有很大的贸易力量，日本如不和中国合作，是没法解决困难的。他举例说：“在我们邻邦中国有着丰富的工业原料，可是我们却从遥远的西半球去购买它，这是非常不合理的。”北村德太郎还表示：“我们一定为扫除中日贸易道路上的障碍，为尽量打开日本大门而努力。”
    出席午宴的，有中国国际贸易促进委员会副主席雷任民、李烛尘、冀朝鼎和委员，全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员廖承志，中国人民外交学会会长张奚若、副会长陈翰笙，以及中国进出口公司的负责人。
    新华社三十日讯　中国人民外交学会会长张奚若在三十日晚举行宴会，招待日本国会议员访苏团。
    张奚若会长在宴会上首先致词，向客人们表示欢迎。他说，中国人民一向主张各国之间应该和平相处和友好合作。各国人民间的友好往来，包括国会议员间的直接接触，是有助于增进彼此之间的了解和合作的。相信此次日本国会议员访苏团的访问苏联和路过中国，将有助于中日和苏日两国人民间的相互了解和进一步的友好合作。
    日本国会议员访苏团第一团长北村德太郎、第二团长野沟胜接着相继讲话，日本各党派议员代表也相继发言，他们一致感谢中国人民外交学会对他们在路过中国时的良好安排和热情招待。并表示要努力促进中日两国人民间的友好合作、经济往来和文化交流。他们认为，日苏、日中关系的正常化，不仅完全符合日本、苏联、中国三国人民的共同利益，而且对亚洲和世界和平都有很大帮助。
    今晚出席宴会作陪的有中国人民外交学会副会长周鲠生、陈翰笙、胡愈之、钱端升、罗隆基，全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员廖承志，中国红十字会会长李德全，中国国际贸易促进委员会副主席雷任民及夏衍、伍云甫、冀朝鼎、卢绪章、曹孟君、梅汝璈、胡兰生等。
    在京的日本人士龟田东伍、金子健太、中村翫右卫门也出席了宴会。
