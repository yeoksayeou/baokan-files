The He(fei)-Pu(kou) Highway, which connects Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, officially opened to traffic on July 21.

This highway is 174 kilometers long and runs across eastern Anhui Province. The Kuomintang reactionary government neglected to repair this highway for a long time before liberation, and severely damaged it when liberation was imminent. The repair project started in March this year and was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of July. Due to the high level of labor enthusiasm shown by the road construction workers, it was completed twenty days ahead of schedule. The entire highway surface was paved using the advanced Soviet "graded aggregate pavement" method. The Anhui Provincial Automobile Transportation Company has established five transportation stations in important cities along the line, so that the local specialties of the Dabie Mountain area and the industrial products of the cities can be exchanged more. Ten calling stations have also been established in larger towns along the way.

    合肥到浦口公路修复通车
    沟通安徽、江苏两省的合（肥）浦（口）公路，在七月二十一日正式通车。
    这条公路全长一百七十四公里，横贯安徽省东部。国民党反动政府在解放以前对这条公路长期不加修整，在临解放时又进行了严重的破坏。整修工程从今年三月开始，原计划七月底完成，由于修路员工发挥了高度的劳动热情，在二十日就提前完工了。公路路面全部是采用苏联先进的“级配路面”铺路法铺筑成的。安徽省汽车运输公司在沿线重要城市设立了五个运输站，使大别山区的土特产和城市的工业品从此可以更多地相互交流。沿途较大的村镇，还设立了十个招呼站。
