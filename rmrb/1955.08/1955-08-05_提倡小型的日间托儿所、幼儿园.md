    Since liberation, childcare organizations have developed very rapidly throughout the country. According to statistics, by the end of 1954, factories and mines alone had 4,003 nurseries, caring for more than 127,000 children, and 2,670 breastfeeding rooms, serving 37,168 breastfeeding infants. According to statistics from 60 cities, there are already 687 mass street childcare stations, caring for 38,452 children. The development of childcare organizations has not only solved the problem for women who are busy with work and production and have no one at home to take care of their children, enabling them to work and produce with peace of mind, but also enables children to be cared for and educated while their mothers participate in production or work. This is beneficial to the country's production and construction and to the healthy growth of the second generation.
    With the development of socialist production and construction, more and more women are participating in production and construction in urban and rural areas, and the demand for the development of nurseries and kindergartens is becoming more and more urgent. However, our country is making every effort to carry out socialist construction, and must carry out comprehensive thrift and gather all possible accumulated funds for investment in production and construction. It is neither possible nor should it draw a large amount of financial and material resources to universally run nurseries and kindergartens. Therefore, it is necessary to fully utilize and give play to all aspects of social manpower and material resources, and advocate that agencies, organizations, enterprises, production organizations, the masses, and private individuals run various, mass self-run and self-managed, small and simple daycare centers and kindergartens. Government business departments should provide work guidance or certain manpower and material support where possible. At present, some people are trying to have the state "take over" nurseries and kindergartens completely; others are wholeheartedly yearning to run "large-scale," "standardized," and "modernized" boarding nurseries and kindergartens. These are all wrong. Because if nurseries and kindergartens are too large and too good, it will be necessary to build better houses, purchase elaborate utensils, and equip more manpower, which will increase the country's unnecessary expenses, deviate from the level of economic development and the general living standards of families in our country, and violate the spirit of comprehensive thrift, and will hinder the widespread establishment of nurseries and kindergartens.
    At present, in many government agencies and enterprises, there is still the idea of running large-scale boarding nurseries and kindergartens. Boarding nurseries and kindergartens were produced under certain historical conditions. They were founded in the revolutionary base areas during the revolutionary war. At that time, the cadres were in a frequent and arduous war environment, with great mobility, and had no time to take care of the upbringing and education of their children. In order to facilitate the actions of cadres and protect the lives and safety of children, a small number of boarding nurseries and kindergartens were established in the base areas. In the early days of liberation, a large number of cadres entered the cities, and because they were busy with work and their lives were not very stable, it was difficult to take care of the upbringing and education of their children. Therefore, based on past experience, some boarding nurseries and kindergartens were established by region and system. Looking at the situation in the past, boarding nurseries have made certain contributions to the revolutionary war, the protection of the safety and health of the children of revolutionaries, and the development of childcare.
    However, boarding nurseries and kindergartens have many shortcomings. First of all, they are relatively wasteful in terms of manpower and material resources, and the economic burden on the state and parents is relatively heavy. In terms of children's education, because children cannot be close to their parents often, and cannot get the joy of maternal love and reunion among family members, children are often indifferent to their parents and family members, and their spirits are not lively and happy enough. Therefore, this kind of nursery and kindergarten is not easy and not suitable for universal establishment. Now our country has entered the third year of the first five-year economic construction plan, and the living standards of employees in government agencies and enterprises have gradually improved, and the work system of government agencies has also gradually become standardized; in the future, we should advocate running small-scale daycare centers and kindergartens, and should not continue to advocate running boarding nurseries and kindergartens.
    Compared with boarding nurseries and kindergartens, small-scale daycare centers and kindergartens have many advantages. First of all, it can save manpower, material resources and financial resources. Because it is daycare, children only live in nurseries and kindergartens for eight to ten hours, and the rest of the time they are at home, so the number of childcare workers, especially administrative staff, can be greatly reduced. The utilization rate of houses is also much higher than that of boarding nurseries. The same house can accommodate more than twice as many children for daycare as for full-time care. In this way, it can reduce expenses, reduce the economic burden on parents, and reduce the state's subsidies for childcare, which is completely in line with the spirit of streamlining and thrift and the needs of the majority of employees.
    Secondly, it is conducive to the all-round development of children. Children go to the institute every morning and live a collective life, and can receive good collective education; in the evening, when they return home, they can get the education and caress of their parents, as well as the friendship between brothers and sisters and family members, so the children live more happily, and their physical and mental health can be better developed. Because children have a wider contact with social life and more opportunities to observe new things, they invisibly broaden their horizons, enrich their common sense, and enhance their thinking ability. In this way, the language, games and homework content of the children will be richer. At the same time, daycare centers and kindergartens are more convenient to contact with parents. When picking up and dropping off children every day, both parties can exchange children's situations and opinions on children's education. In this way, family education and the education of nurseries and kindergartens can easily reach a consensus, and can also strengthen parents' sense of responsibility for educating their children.
    Third, daycare centers and kindergartens are small in scale, cost less money, can save manpower, material resources and financial resources, are easy to run, and are easy to manage, which can promote the development of children's childcare.
    Based on the above situation, the existing boarding nurseries and kindergartens should be gradually changed into daycare centers and kindergartens as the living and working conditions of the majority of employees change, so that employees can better shoulder the glorious responsibility of raising and educating their children. Some parents, on the pretext that they are busy with work and study, completely hand over the responsibility of raising and educating their children to nurseries and kindergartens, saying that only boarding nurseries and kindergartens can really solve the problem, and that daycare centers and kindergartens are useless, because they work during the day and have to take care of their children when they go home at night, which makes them very tired. This view is obviously incorrect. Nurseries and kindergartens can only solve the difficulties of parents in raising and educating their children during production and working hours, and they cannot completely replace the responsibility of parents in raising and educating their children. To cultivate children into all-round socialist new people, it must be the joint responsibility of the family, nurseries, kindergartens and schools, so parents should never relax their responsibility for educating their children. As for a small number of employees who do have difficulties, such as those who travel frequently or have to work at night and have no one at home to help raise their children, a small number of boarding nurseries should be set up or some boarding beds should be set up in daycare centers and kindergartens in order to accommodate their children. In addition, the time for daycare children to be entrusted should be based on the working hours of parents, and convenience should be given to parents as much as possible. Leaders of state agencies and enterprises should take care of employees with children, and should not let them work overtime, and should try to reduce their evening activities, so that they have a certain amount of time to live with their children and educate them.
    Daycare centers (stations) and kindergartens can generally adopt the following organizational methods: First, they can be set up inside or near government agencies and enterprises, and led and managed by the administrative departments of the agencies and enterprises, and accommodate the children of employees of the agencies. If an agency is unable to run it alone, it can also jointly run it with several nearby agencies to accommodate the children of employees of several agencies. Secondly, it can be set up near collective dormitories, and led and managed by grass-roots trade unions or family committees, and give play to the political enthusiasm and potential strength of employees' families to serve the society. So that they can not only get part of their income, but also be trained and improved in their work. Third, in order to solve the problem of children of employees scattered on the streets being entrusted, childcare centers (stations) and kindergartens can be set up on the streets. Street childcare centers (stations) and kindergartens should, under the promotion of grass-roots party and government and mass organizations, especially grass-roots women's congresses, give full play to the manpower and material resources of the masses and enthusiastic people to run them, and grass-roots cadres and activists among the masses should jointly organize a management committee to conduct regular leadership and supervision. In addition to the above methods, we should continue to advocate the methods of mutual help between relatives and neighbors and individual entrustment. Because although small and simple daycare centers are easy to run, they cannot meet the needs of all employees at present.
    In order to enable the majority of employees to play a greater role in the cause of socialist construction, we should make full use of public and private forces to run various, small and simple daycare centers (stations) and kindergartens, so that those employees who are busy with work and production and have no one at home to take care of their children can work and produce with peace of mind, and so that the country's next generation can receive more reasonable care and education when their parents participate in production and work.

### 提倡小型的日间托儿所、幼儿园

    提倡小型的日间托儿所、幼儿园
    解放以来，全国各地的托儿组织发展得非常迅速。据统计，到一九五四年底，仅厂矿企业就已经有四千零三个托儿所，收托儿童十二万七千多名，有哺乳室二千六百七十个，哺乳婴儿三万七千一百六十八人。又据六十个城市的统计，群众性的街道托儿站已有六百八十七处，收托儿童三万八千四百五十二人。托儿组织的发展，不仅为那些因工作、生产繁忙而家中无人照顾孩子的妇女解决了问题，使他们能够安心生产，安心工作；而且使孩子在母亲参加生产或工作时能够得到照管和教养。这是有利于国家的生产建设，有利于第二代的身心健康成长的。
    随着社会主义生产建设的发展，在城市和农村参加生产建设的妇女日益增多，对发展托儿所、幼儿园的要求也越来越迫切；但是我们的国家正全力进行社会主义建设，必须展开全面节约，聚集一切可能积累的资金投入生产建设，不可能也不应该抽出大量财力、物力来普遍举办托儿所、幼儿园。因此必须充分运用和发挥社会上各方面的人力、物力，提倡由机关、团体、企业单位、生产组织、群众和私人来举办多种多样的，群众自办自管的，小型简便的日间托儿所、幼儿园。政府业务部门在可能条件下，给予工作上的指导或某些人力、物力上的扶持。目前还有些人企图将托儿所、幼儿园完全由国家“包下来”；还有些人一心向往举办“大规模”、“正规化”、“现代化”的寄宿制的托儿所、幼儿园，这些都是错误的。因为托儿所、幼儿园搞得太大、太好，就需要建筑较好的房子，购置讲究的用具，配备更多的人力，这就会增加国家不必要的开支，就会脱离我国现在经济发展的水平和一般家庭生活水平，这也就违背了全面节约的精神，并且会阻碍托儿所、幼儿园的普遍建立。
    目前在许多机关企业单位中，还存在着举办大型的寄宿制托儿所、幼儿园的思想。寄宿制托儿所、幼儿园是在一定的历史条件下产生的，它创办于革命战争时期的革命根据地。当时干部处在频繁艰苦的战争环境中，流动性很大，无暇顾及子女的抚养和教育。为了干部行动方便和保护孩子们的生命安全，在根据地内举办了少数寄宿制托儿所、保育院。解放初期，大批干部进入城市，由于工作繁忙，生活也还不十分安定，对孩子的抚养和教育也很难照顾。因此，根据过去的经验，按地区、按系统地设立了一些寄宿制托儿所、保育院。从过去的情况来看，寄宿制托儿所对革命战争和保护革命者子女的安全和健康，对发展保育事业，都是有一定贡献的。
    但是，寄宿制托儿所、幼儿园有着许多缺陷，它首先在人力、物力方面比较浪费，国家和父母在经济上的负担都比较重。在对儿童的教育方面，由于孩子不能经常接近父母，得不到母爱和家庭成员间相聚的快乐，孩子往往对父母和家人的感情比较冷淡，精神也不够活泼愉快。因而这种托儿所、幼儿园不容易也不宜于普遍设立。现在我们国家已进入了第一个五年经济建设计划的第三年，机关企业职工的生活水平已逐步提高，而且机关工作制度也逐渐正规起来；今后应当提倡举办小型的日间托儿所、幼儿园，而不应当继续提倡举办寄宿制的托儿所、幼儿园。
    跟寄宿制托儿所、幼儿园相比较，小型日间托儿所、幼儿园具有很多优点。它首先可以节约人力、物力、财力。因为是日托，孩子只在托儿所、幼儿园里生活八到十小时，其余时间都在家里，保教人员，尤其是行政管理人员就可以大大减少。房子的利用率也要比寄宿制托儿所高得多，同样的房子，日托可比全托多收容一倍以上的孩子。这样，就能缩减经费开支，既减轻了父母的经济负担，也减少了国家机关对托儿事业的补助经费，这是完全符合精简节约的精神和广大职工的需要的。
    其次，它有利于儿童的全面发展。孩子们每天早上入所，过着集体生活，可以受到良好的集体教育；傍晚回到家里，又可以得到父母的教育和爱抚，以及兄弟姐妹家庭成员间的友爱，因而孩子们生活得更愉快，身心能够得到更好的发展。由于孩子们接触社会生活较广，观察新鲜事物的机会较多，无形中就扩大了眼界，丰富了常识，增强了思维能力。这样孩子们的语言、游戏及作业内容也就会更丰富。同时日间托儿所、幼儿园同家长间的联系比较方便，在每天接送孩子的时候，双方就可以交换孩子的情况和对儿童教育的意见。这样，家庭教育和托儿所、幼儿园的教育容易取得一致，也能够加强父母教育子女的责任感。
    第三，日间托儿所、幼儿园规模小，花钱少，能做到节约人力、物力和财力，容易举办，也便于管理，就可以促进儿童保育事业的发展。
    根据以上情况，现有的寄宿制托儿所、幼儿园应当随着广大职工的生活和工作条件的改变而逐渐改变为日间托儿所、幼儿园，使职工们将抚养和教育子女的光荣责任更好地担当起来。有些父母，借口自己工作忙，学习忙，把抚养和教育子女的责任，完全交给托儿所、幼儿园，说什么只有寄宿制托儿所、幼儿园才能真正解决问题，日间托儿所、幼儿园不顶事，因为自己白天工作，晚上回家还要带孩子，弄得非常疲劳。这种看法，显然是不正确的。托儿所、幼儿园只能解决父母在生产和工作时间内抚养和教育孩子的困难，它不可能完全代替父母抚养和教育子女的责任。要培养孩子成为全面发展的社会主义新人，必须由家庭、托儿所、幼儿园和学校共同负责，因此父母始终不能放松教育子女的责任。至于对一部分确实有困难的职工，如经常出差或必须在夜间工作而家中又无人帮助抚养子女的，则应当设立少数寄宿制托儿所或在日间托儿所、幼儿园内设置部分寄宿制床位，以便收容他们的孩子。此外，日间托儿所的儿童寄托时间应当根据家长的工作时间，并且应尽量给家长以方便。国家机关企业的领导方面，应当照顾有孩子的职工，不要让他们加班加点，尽量减少他们的晚间活动，以便使他们有一定时间同子女在一起生活，教养子女。
    日间托儿所（站）、幼儿园一般地可采用下列几种组织办法：第一、设在机关企业单位内部或机关附近，由本机关企业行政部门进行领导和管理，收容本机关职工的子女；假如一个机关无力单独举办时，还可以同附近几个机关联合举办，收托几个机关的职工的子女。其次，设立在集体宿舍附近，由基层工会或家属委员会领导和管理，发挥职工家属为社会服务的政治热忱和潜在力量。使他们既能得到部分收入，又可在工作中得到锻炼和提高。第三、为了解决散居在街道上的职工的子女寄托问题，可以在街道设立托儿所（站）、幼儿园。街道托儿所（站）、幼儿园应在基层党政和群众组织，特别是基层妇女代表会的推动下，充分发挥群众和热心人士的人力、物力来办，由街道基层干部和群众中的积极分子共同组织管理委员会进行经常的领导和监督。除以上几种办法外，仍应继续提倡亲邻相帮、个别寄托的办法。因为小型简便的日间托儿所虽然容易举办，但目前还不能满足所有职工的需要。
    为了使广大职工在社会主义的建设事业中发挥更大的作用，我们应该充分地运用公、私各方面力量，举办多种多样的、小型简便的日间托儿所（站）、幼儿园，使那些工作、生产繁忙而家中无人照顾孩子的职工能够安心生产、工作，也使国家的后一代在父母参加生产和工作时能得到比较合理的照管和教育。
