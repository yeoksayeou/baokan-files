    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 31st: Premier Zhou Enlai's speech on the current international situation and China's foreign policy at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress has received attention in the United States. On the 30th, all afternoon newspapers in Washington carried reports about this speech on the front page with large headlines.
    Senator George, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Democratic Senator, said that Zhou Enlai's tone was conciliatory. Senator Wiley, a Republican member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said, "I am sure this statement is good news for the State Department, and I hope we will hear better news before the weekend." Democratic Senator Humphrey stated that the United States cannot accept Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal in his speech that countries in Asia and the Pacific region sign a collective peace pact to replace the confrontational military blocs currently existing in the region.
    France
    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 31st: According to a report by Agence France-Presse, Paris, Paris expressed "great interest" in Premier Zhou Enlai, who is also the Foreign Minister, speech at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress. Agence France-Presse said: "French authoritative sources believe that the important speech delivered by Chinese Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai at the Chinese National People's Congress is proof that the 'Spirit of Geneva' is continuing. They said that this speech, delivered on the eve of the start of the Sino-U.S. talks in Geneva, is a further step in the process of generally easing the international atmosphere."
    Agence France-Presse also said, "Some observers believe that things may develop quickly now, and Asian issues may be dealt with—if not resolved—together with European issues. However, they do not believe that Zhou Enlai's proposal to conclude a security treaty including all Pacific countries can be realized in the near future."

    周恩来总理的发言引起广泛重视
    美国
    新华社三十一日讯　华盛顿消息：周恩来总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上关于目前国际形势和中国外交政策的发言，在美国受到了重视。三十日，华盛顿所有下午报纸都在第一版用大标题刊载了关于这个发言的报道。
    参议院外交委员会主席、民主党参议员乔治说，周恩来的语调是和解的。参议院外交委员会委员、共和党参议员维利说：“我肯定这个声明对国务院讲是一个好消息，我希望我们将在周末以前听到更好的消息。”民主党参议员汉弗莱表示，美国不能接受周恩来总理发言中关于亚洲和太平洋地区的国家签订集体和平公约以代替目前存在于这个地区的对立性军事集团的主张。
    法国
    新华社三十一日讯　据法新社巴黎三十日电报道，巴黎方面对周恩来总理兼外交部长在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言表示“很大的兴趣”。法新社说：“法国权威人士认为：中国总理兼外长周恩来在中国全国人民代表大会上发表的重要演说，是‘日内瓦精神’正在继续中的证明。他们说，这篇在中美日内瓦会谈开始的前夕发表的演说，是国际气氛一般说来趋于缓和的进程中的一个进一步的步骤。”
    法新社又说，“有些观察家认为，现在事情可能发展很快，亚洲问题可能同欧洲问题一同得到处理——即使不是得到解决。但是，他们并不认为周恩来提出的关于缔结一个包括全部太平洋国家在内的安全条约的建议是可以在最近的将来得到实现的事。”
    印度
    新华社新德里三十一日电　德里各报三十一日都在头版登载了周恩来总理三十日在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上所作的关于目前形势和我国外交政策的发言。
    “印度快报”的通栏标题是：“周恩来建议缔结亚洲—太平洋和平公约”、“公约将包括美国”。“印度斯坦时报”和“印度斯坦旗报”也用了类似的通栏标题。
    捷克斯洛伐克
    新华社布拉格三十一日电　捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”和“人民防线报”以及其他报纸在七月三十一日都刊载了中华人民共和国国务院总理兼外交部长周恩来在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言摘要。各报还报道了第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议闭幕的消息。
