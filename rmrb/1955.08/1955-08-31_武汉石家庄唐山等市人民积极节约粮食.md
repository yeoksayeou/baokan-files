　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 30th: Saving food has become a mass activity in Wuhan. Many housewives have realized that saving is a practical action for women to support the country's socialist construction. They actively create and promote advanced cooking methods, and plan their family food consumption. Women's organizations in various districts and streets exchange experiences in saving food through women's representative meetings and housewives' meetings. After careful calculation and improvement of cooking methods, more than 6,600 households in Jiang'an District saved more than 40,000 jin of grain compared with the original grain consumption plan. Zhu Peixiang, a worker's family member in Chongren Street, Qiaokou District, saved 24 jin of grain in a month. She said at a forum for advanced figures in saving food among street residents in the district: "Our country is a big family. If the country wants to develop, every family must support it."
　　Citizens not only pay attention to saving food themselves, but also actively assist the government in supervising and reporting illegal acts of hoarding and smuggling grain. Up to July, the masses in Jiang'an District had reported and exposed more than 90 cases of hoarding and smuggling grain to the government.
　　In the past four months, the districts and streets of Wuhan have repeatedly explained the great significance of saving food to the country's construction during the verification of planned grain supply by household, and gradually strengthened people's awareness of cherishing food. The residents' committees and residents' groups in 24 streets in Jianghan District held more than 2,000 mobilization meetings, large and small, to save food. Many street activists also visited and promoted the idea from house to house, helping neighbors make good food consumption plans.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, August 28th: In eight medium-sized cities in Hebei Province, including Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Baoding, Zhangjiakou, and Handan, saving food has gradually become a common practice among the masses.
　　Collective catering units such as government agencies, organizations, factories, mines, and schools in various cities have come up with various methods to improve the phenomenon of food waste revealed in the early stages of the movement. More than 470 catering units in Tangshan City verified the number of diners and earnestly implemented the grain consumption budget and final account system, making achievements in reducing food waste. Qinhuangdao Rehabilitation Center regards saving food as one of the main contents of the weekly life meeting, and often criticizes the behavior of wasting food. More than 110 cooks in 35 government agencies in Zhangjiakou City launched a work competition with saving food as the main content.
　　Citizens in various cities have generally formulated savings plans or savings covenants. In Shijiazhuang City, more than 80% of residents had made plans to save food by the end of June. After more than 1,600 households in Zhangjiakou City formulated plans to save food and reduce waste, the amount of grain used in July decreased by more than 8,400 jin compared with the past. The amount of grain sold in the eight cities in July decreased by more than one-fifth compared with April when the grain saving campaign began.
　　The staff of grain processing and storage departments in various cities also attach great importance to saving food. Three flour mills in Shijiazhuang City promoted some new operating methods, and increased flour production by more than 350,000 jin in the second quarter. Zheng Ni, a resident of Heping District, Shijiazhuang City, also reported illegal acts of hoarding grain, and Li Jinxiu, a resident of Yong'an Street, took the initiative to go to the police station to offer suggestions on plugging loopholes in grain supply work.

　　武汉石家庄唐山等市人民积极节约粮食
    新华社武汉三十日电　节约粮食已成为武汉市群众性的活动。很多家庭主妇都认识到节约是妇女支援国家进行社会主义建设的实际行动。她们积极创造和推广先进做饭方法，有计划地安排家庭用粮。各区、街的妇女组织通过妇女代表会、家庭主妇会，交流节约粮食的经验。江岸区六千六百多户居民，精打细算和改进做饭方法后，比原来用粮计划节约了四万多斤粮食。礄口区崇仁街工人家属朱培香一个月节约了二十四斤粮食。她在本区街道居民节约粮食先进人物座谈会上说：“我们的国家就是一个大家庭，国家要建设，就必须要每一个家庭来支援。”
    市民们不但自己注意节约粮食，还积极协助政府监督和检举囤积居奇、走私贩运粮食的不法行为。到七月份为止，江岸区群众就向政府检举、揭发了九十多起囤积、走私粮食的案件。
    四个月来，武汉市各区和街道在粮食按户核实计划供应中，反复向群众说明了节约粮食对国家建设的重大意义，逐步加强了人们珍惜粮食的观念。江汉区二十四条街的居民委员会和居民小组，曾分别召开动员节约粮食的大会、小会共有两千多次。很多街道积极分子还挨家挨户去访问、宣传，帮助邻居订好用粮计划。
    新华社保定二十八日电　在河北省石家庄、唐山、保定、张家口、邯郸等八个中等城市，节约粮食已逐渐成为群众中的风气。
    各市的机关、团体、厂矿、学校等集体伙食单位，都针对运动初期揭发出来的粮食浪费现象，想出各种办法改进。唐山市四百七十多个伙食单位，核实吃饭人数，认真执行用粮预、决算制度，在减少粮食浪费方面做出了成绩。秦皇岛市教养院把节约粮食作为每周生活会的主要内容之一，经常对浪费粮食的行为进行批评。张家口市三十五个机关单位的一百一十多名炊事员，开展了以节约粮食为主要内容的工作竞赛。
    各市市民普遍制定了节约计划或节约公约。石家庄市在六月底就已有百分之八十以上的居民订了节约粮食计划。张家口市一千六百多户居民订立节约粮食计划减少浪费后，七月份用粮数量比过去减少八千四百多斤。八个城市七月份销售的粮食，比粮食节约运动开始时的四月份减少了五分之一多。
    各城市的粮食加工、保管部门的职工对节约粮食也很重视。石家庄市三个面粉厂推行一些新的操作方法，第二季度就增产面粉三十五万多斤。石家庄市和平区居民郑妮还检举了囤积粮食的不法行为，永安街居民李金秀主动到派出所提出堵塞粮食供应工作中的漏洞的意见。
