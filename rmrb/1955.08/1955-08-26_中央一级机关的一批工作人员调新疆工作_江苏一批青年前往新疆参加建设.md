　　A Group of Staff Members from Central-Level Organs Transferred to Work in Xinjiang
　　A Group of Young People from Jiangsu Go to Xinjiang to Participate in Construction
　　Xinhua News Agency: The first group of seventy-nine staff members drawn from central-level organs to work in Xinjiang departed from Beijing on the 21st. In the future, more than one thousand staff members from central-level organs will be successively transferred to work in Xinjiang. These staff members will be assigned to work in county- and district-level organs and newly established units in Xinjiang Province.
　　Among the first group of staff members transferred to Xinjiang from central-level organs, the majority are Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, with cadres at or above the section chief level accounting for more than one-tenth. Among the thirteen staff members transferred to Xinjiang by the Central Meteorological Bureau alone, five are cadres who joined the revolution during or before the Anti-Japanese War.

　　Our correspondent in Nanjing reports: On August 22nd, five hundred and forty young men and women from Jiangsu Province who volunteered to participate in the construction of the frontier departed from Nanjing for Xinjiang. They are all graduates of junior middle schools in Jiangsu Province this year, of which 30 percent are members of the Communist Youth League, and female students account for one-third. Before their departure, Nanjing, Suzhou, Changzhou and other places held rallies to send off the young students to participate in the construction of Xinjiang. Responsible persons from the local education administrative organs and the Communist Youth League personally attended the meetings to meet the young people participating in the construction of Xinjiang, and encouraged them to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, actively participate in the construction of the motherland's frontier, and train themselves to become experts in driving tractors and engaging in water conservancy, hygiene and other work. The young people expressed their firm determination to participate in the construction of Xinjiang at the meeting. Ren Qin from Nanjing City's Chengzhong Middle School said: "I love my hometown, and I love the frontier even more. To establish new villages, farms, and factories in that uninhabited place, there will be many difficulties, but the stone is hard, but not harder than my determination, and the Tianshan Mountains are high, but not higher than my feet. I am determined to use my wisdom and hands, and use hard work to build Xinjiang more prosperous and strong, so that all the resources and wasteland of the frontier can serve the great socialist cause of the motherland."

　　中央一级机关的一批工作人员调新疆工作
　　江苏一批青年前往新疆参加建设
    从中央一级机关抽调出来的去新疆工作的第一批工作人员七十九人，已在二十一日自北京出发。今后在中央一级机关还将有一千多名工作人员被陆续抽调到新疆去工作。这些工作人员将被分配在新疆省的县、区级机关和新建单位工作。
    第一批下调到新疆去的中央一级机关工作人员中，大部分是共产党员和青年团员，科长级以上的干部占十分之一以上。仅中央气象局这次抽调到新疆去的十三名工作人员中，就有五名是在抗日战争时期和抗日战争以前参加革命工作的干部。　（新华社）
    江苏省有五百四十名志愿参加边疆建设的男女青年，在八月二十二日由南京出发前往新疆。他们都是江苏省本届初中毕业学生，其中百分之三十是青年团员，女学生占三分之一。临行以前，南京、苏州、常州等地都举行了欢送青年学生参加建设新疆的大会，各地教育行政机关、青年团的负责人都亲自到会和参加建设新疆的青年们见面，勉励他们发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，积极参加祖国边疆的建设，把自己锻炼成为驾驶拖拉机和从事水利、卫生等工作的能手。青年们在会上表示了参加新疆建设事业的坚定不移的决心。南京市城中中学任勤说：“我爱我的故乡，我更爱边疆。要想在那渺无人烟的地方建立起新村庄、农场和工厂，这是有很多困难的，但是石头硬，硬不过我的决心，天山高，高不过我的脚杆。我下定决心，用自己的智慧和双手，用辛勤的劳动把新疆建设得更加繁荣富强，使边疆所有的资源和荒地都为祖国伟大的社会主义事业服务。”　（本报驻南京记者）
