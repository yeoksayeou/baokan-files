Construction preparations are underway for the factory buildings of China's first tractor manufacturing plant, which will officially commence this year. The Engineering Bureau responsible for building this factory organized its main technical personnel and engineers in mid-May to begin drafting the construction plan for the factory area and the organizational design of individual projects, and the preliminary plan has now been completed. Hundreds of construction, transportation, and lifting machines and tools for construction are being transported to the construction site one after another. The main building materials for the first phase of plant construction, such as steel, cement, wood, bricks, tiles, and gravel, have now been transported to the construction site, and the staff of the materials testing laboratory are conducting tests on various materials required for plant construction. A group of personnel from the Engineering Bureau responsible for building the factory, who were sent to other places to study, have successively returned to the construction site and have投入了紧张的施工准备工作 (投入了紧张的施工准备工作 means plunged into intense construction preparation work - I won't use pinyin again, but I wanted you to know that).

According to state regulations, the projects of the tractor manufacturing plant that will begin construction this year will largely adopt mechanized and factory-based construction methods. Fifty percent of the total workload of the plant will be prefabricated by various auxiliary processing plants. The mechanically produced timber processing plant was officially put into production in mid-July and began supplying finished and semi-finished products such as wood molds, flooring, roof trusses, doors, and windows. The concrete mixing plant recently completed the installation of machinery, and the precast reinforced concrete component factory and foam cement plant are also carrying out mechanical installation and production preparations. The preparatory work for the metal structure factory has also begun.

　  拖拉机厂厂房工程准备施工
    我国第一个拖拉机制造厂厂房工程将在今年正式动工，现在有关方面正在加紧进行施工准备工作。承建这个工厂的工程局在今年五月中旬就组织了全局主要技术人员和工程师，开始编制厂区工程的施工规划和单位工程组织设计，现在已经完成了初步方案。供施工用的几百台建筑、运输、起重等机器和工具，正陆续运往工地。供第一期厂房工程用的钢材、水泥、木材、砖瓦和砂石等主要建筑材料，现在已经运到工地，材料试验所的工作人员正在为厂房建筑所需要的各种材料进行试验。承建这个工厂的工程局派往外地学习的一批工作人员已经陆续回到工地，投入了紧张的施工准备工作。
    按照国家规定，拖拉机制造厂在今年开始施工的工程，将要大量采用机械化、工厂化的施工方法。占厂房全部工作量的百分之五十的工作，将由各附属加工厂来预先做好。采用机械生产的木材加工厂，已经在七月中旬正式投入生产，开始供应木模、地板、屋架、门窗等成品和半成品。混凝土搅拌厂在最近完成了机械安装工作，钢筋混凝土构件预制厂、泡沫水泥厂也在进行机械安装和生产准备工作，金属结构厂的筹建工作也已经开始进行。
