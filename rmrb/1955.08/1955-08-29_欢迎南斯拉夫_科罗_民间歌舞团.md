Welcome the Yugoslav "Kolo" Folk Dance Ensemble

　　Led by O. Skovran, the Yugoslav "Kolo" Folk Dance Ensemble has come to our country after successful performances in various parts of the Soviet Union. We welcome our distinguished guests with joy and excitement. Yugoslav folk songs and dances are very rich, and our audience will see how they reflect the life and struggle, ideals and aspirations of the various ethnic groups of Yugoslavia. The performance activities of the "Kolo" Folk Dance Ensemble in our country will undoubtedly enhance mutual understanding between the people of the two countries and promote cultural cooperation and artistic exchanges between the two countries. This will play an active role in further strengthening the friendly unity of the cultural and artistic circles and the people of the two countries.

　　The friendship between the people of China and Yugoslavia is based on common interests and common aspirations. The Yugoslav people fought side by side with the Soviet army in the war against fascist aggression and achieved a great victory, which greatly encouraged the Chinese people who were resisting Japanese imperialism. In the post-war struggle for international peaceful coexistence and the maintenance of the world workers' movement, the Yugoslav people have also made unremitting efforts, especially the friendly talks between the Yugoslav government delegation and the Soviet government delegation and the signing of the Soviet-Yugoslav government declaration not long ago, which had a profound impact on the current international situation. Based on the results of the talks, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia put forward major principles to guide the two governments in handling international affairs, determined common views on resolving current pressing issues, and formulated principles for further consolidating the foundation of friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. This not only eliminates all obstacles to the complete normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, but also creates an extremely favorable atmosphere for international peace and cooperation, and makes a great contribution to the movement for lasting peace, which is welcomed and supported by all those who love peace and care about the socialist cause. The Chinese people regard the improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia as a major event in international affairs, as a major victory for the entire peace and democracy camp, and as an important guarantee for the development of friendly cooperation between China and Yugoslavia. We feel particularly excited and happy to welcome the Yugoslav "Kolo" Folk Dance Ensemble at a time when we are developing friendly cooperation on the basis of the normal diplomatic relations already established between China and Yugoslavia.

　　The Yugoslav "Kolo" Folk Dance Ensemble is an envoy of peace and friendship, and also a disseminator of brilliant Yugoslav folk art. Yugoslav folk songs and dances have a long history, rich content, diverse forms, distinct folk colors and prominent national style. They truly reflect the life and spirit of the various ethnic groups of Yugoslavia, their love of life, love of peace, hatred of aggression, and courage to fight, and also reflect their artistic talents. The performance of such beautiful folk songs and dances will undoubtedly give our audience inspiration in all aspects.

　　The artists of the Yugoslav "Kolo" Folk Dance Ensemble are not only outstanding performers of Yugoslav folk songs and dances, but also rigorous organizers and processors of Yugoslav folk songs and dances. They take a cautious attitude towards folk songs and dances. They collect folk dances from various ethnic groups, study them carefully, and strive to preserve their folk flavor when processing them. When stage design and musical accompaniment must be added to certain dances, they strive not to deviate from the original dance form. This serious attitude towards folk art is worthy of our learning.

　　Through watching the performances of the Yugoslav "Kolo" Folk Dance Ensemble, and through contact and discussions with the folk artists of the "Kolo" Folk Dance Ensemble, our artists will surely be able to learn a lot. Learn from them the experience of sorting out and refining folk songs and dances, learn from them the experience of performing folk songs and dances, and learn from them the experience of popularizing and improving songs and dances. This will be very helpful in improving our country's dance and music work.

　　Our distinguished guests will see the true face of new China in our capital and other places, see the new Chinese people's love for peaceful construction, see their sincere efforts to defend the cause of world peace, and see their deep friendship with the Yugoslav people.

　　We wish the artists of the "Kolo" Folk Dance Ensemble good health and wish them success in their performances in our country.

　　欢迎南斯拉夫“科罗”民间歌舞团
    由奥·斯科夫兰领导的南斯拉夫“科罗”民间歌舞团在苏联各地进行了成功的演出之后来到了我国，我们以欢忻鼓舞的心情欢迎我们的贵宾。南斯拉夫的民间歌舞是非常丰富的，我国观众将看到它们所反映的南斯拉夫各族人民的生活和斗争、理想和愿望。“科罗”民间歌舞团在我国的演出活动，无疑地将增进两国人民的相互了解，促进两国的文化合作和艺术交流。这对于进一步加强两国文化艺术界和两国人民的友爱团结，将起积极的作用。
    中国和南斯拉夫两国人民的友谊是以共同利益和共同愿望为基础的。南斯拉夫人民在反抗法西斯侵略的战争中同苏联军队并肩作战，取得伟大的胜利，曾给抗击日本帝国主义的中国人民以极大的鼓舞。在战后争取国际和平共处和维护世界工人运动的事业中，南斯拉夫人民也作了不断的努力，特别是不久前南斯拉夫政府代表团和苏联政府代表团的友好会谈和苏、南两国政府宣言的签署，给予当前国际局势以深刻的影响。苏、南两国根据会谈的结果，提出了指导两国政府处理国际事务的重大原则，确定了关于解决当前迫切问题的共同观点，制定了进一步巩固苏、南两国友好合作基础的原则。这就不仅扫除了苏、南两国关系完全正常化的一切障碍，而且为国际和平合作创造了极其有利的气氛，对争取持久和平的运动作了巨大的贡献，得到了一切爱好和平和关心社会主义事业的人的欢迎和支持。中国人民把苏、南两国关系的改进看作国际事务中的重大事件，看作整个和平民主阵营的重大胜利，看作发展中、南两国间友好合作的重要保证。我们在中、南两国已经建立起来的正常外交关系的基础上正在发展友好合作的时候来欢迎南斯拉夫“科罗”民间歌舞团，倍感兴奋和愉快。
    南斯拉夫“科罗”民间歌舞团是和平和友谊的使者，也是光辉的南斯拉夫民间艺术的传播者。南斯拉夫的民间歌舞具有悠久的历史，有丰富的内容、多样的形式、鲜明的民间色彩和突出的民族风格。它们真实地反映了南斯拉夫各族人民的生活面貌和精神面貌，反映了他们热爱生活、热爱和平、痛恨侵略、勇于战斗的性格特征，也反映了他们的艺术才能。这种优美的民间歌舞的演出，无疑地会给我国观众以各方面的启发。
    南斯拉夫“科罗”民间歌舞团的艺术家们，不仅是南斯拉夫民间歌舞的出色的表演者，而且是南斯拉夫民间歌舞的谨严的整理者和加工者。他们对民间歌舞采取慎重的态度。他们收集各民族的民间舞蹈，细心地研究它们，在加工的时候，努力保留它们的民间风味。在必须为某些舞蹈配上舞台设计和音乐伴奏的时候，他们力求不脱离原来的舞蹈形式。这种对待民间艺术的严肃态度，是值得我们学习的。
    通过对南斯拉夫“科罗”民间歌舞团的演出的观摩，通过同“科罗”民间歌舞团的民间艺术家们的接触和座谈，我国的艺术家们一定可以学到很多东西。向他们学习整理和提炼民间歌舞的经验，学习表演民间歌舞的经验，学习歌舞的普及和提高工作的经验。这对于改进我国的舞蹈和音乐工作是很有帮助的。
    我们的贵宾们将在我国首都和其他各地看到新中国的真实面貌，看到新中国人民对和平建设的热爱，看到他们对保卫世界和平事业的真诚努力，看到他们对南斯拉夫人民的深厚友谊。
    我们祝“科罗”民间歌舞团的艺术家们健康，祝他们在我国演出的成功。
