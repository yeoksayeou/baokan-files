　　Enough to Eat According to Rationing Standards
　　Xiao Yunti
　　My name is Xiao Yunti, and I am a resident of the Baishulin District of Beilin District in Xi'an. On August 15th, after listening to the speech by the District Committee Secretary regarding the grain rationing method, I thought to myself: I am the security committee member of Baishulin. The Party and the government are calling on the people to implement grain rationing. How can I not take the lead? At that time, some people reflected that it was not enough to eat, and I was not sure in my heart. I decided to go home and experiment and calculate the details to see if it was really enough to eat. The result was that my family had enough to eat each month according to the quantity standards stipulated by rationing.
　　At first, my son-in-law and daughter also thought that the quantity stipulated by rationing was not enough to eat. My son-in-law said, "Are sixteen catties enough for two children (one a little over one year old and one three years old)?" I explained to him, "You can't just look at the numbers. Considering adults and children together, it's enough. Let's make careful calculations and guarantee it's enough." After experimentation and careful calculation, they all understood. My son-in-law even educated the children, saying, "Don't throw away your steamed buns anymore."
　　Through careful calculation, I discovered that my family's waste of grain in the past was very serious. There are eight people in my family in total, and six people eat at home (three adults and three children aged one to seven). In the past, the planned monthly grain consumption was 170 catties. According to the new rationing standards, it is 137 catties, a reduction of 33 catties per month. If this 33 catties can be avoided by reducing waste, it can be fully saved. In the past, I didn't plan my life. When cooking, I used a bowl to scoop. If I scooped too much and everyone couldn't finish it, there would be leftovers. What to do with the leftovers? It would be a pity to throw them away, so everyone would divide them up and put them in their stomachs. At the same time, my family has many children, and the waste is also very large. The children often want steamed buns, and the adults don't pay attention to how much the children can eat, so they give them a steamed bun at a time. If they can't finish it, they throw it away. Once I saw my grandson throw away a piece of steamed bun weighing more than two ounces; I don't know how much more I didn't see. At mealtime, fearing that the children would not have enough to eat, they would give them more. If the children couldn't finish it, the adults would not want to eat it because it was dirty, and as a result, it would be discarded. In addition, there is waste in mixing noodles, washing rice, etc. My son works in Xi'an, and the family does not buy his grain, but he comes home every Sunday and eats at home for a day. Even so, my family sometimes has a surplus of grain that we purchased according to the plan. If every household in cities and towns across the country wasted more than 30 catties of grain per month like my family, what a great loss this would cause to the country! After this detailed calculation, I not only saved more than 30 catties of grain for the country each month, but also saved more than five yuan a month for myself, which is beneficial to both the country and myself. （Reported by Hao Jian）

　　按定量标准是够吃的
　　萧云悌
    我叫萧云悌，是西安市碑林区柏树林居民。八月十五日我听了区委书记关于粮食定量供应办法的讲话后，我心里盘算着：我是柏树林的治安委员，党和政府号召人民实行定量用粮，我怎能不起带头作用呢？当时有人反映不够吃，我心里也没有把握，我就决定回家试验一下并算一算细账，看真的够不够吃。结果算出按定量标准规定的数量我家每月也是够吃的。
    起初，我的女婿和女儿也认为按定量规定的数量不够吃。女婿说：“两个孩子（一个一岁多，一个三岁）十六斤还够？”我向他解释：“你们不能光看数字，大拉小，是够的，我们再精打细算，保证够吃。”经过试验和算细账，他们都想通了。女婿并教育孩子说：“以后可不要再丢馍了。”
    通过算细账，检查出我家过去浪费粮食的情况是很严重的。我家共八口人，在家吃饭的有六口人（大人三口，一岁多至七岁的小孩三口），过去每月定用粮计划是一百七十斤，按新的定量供应标准是一百三十七斤，每月减少了三十三斤。这三十三斤如果能避免浪费是满可以节余出来的。过去我过日子没有计划，做饭时都是用碗来挖，挖的多了，大家吃不了就剩下，剩下怎么办呢？丢了怪可惜，于是大家又分开装到肚子里。同时，我家小孩多，浪费也很大，孩子时常要馍馍，大人也不注意孩子能吃多少，一次就给他一个馍馍，吃不了就丢了。有一次我看见我的外孙子竟丢了二两多重的一块馍馍；没见到的不知还有多少。吃饭时唯恐孩子吃不饱，就给他多盛些，孩子吃不了，大人嫌脏不愿吃，结果也就抛掉了。另外，拌面、淘米等都有浪费。我的儿子在西安市工作，家里不买他的粮食，但他每个星期日回家，要在家吃一天饭。虽然如此，我家按计划买的粮食有时还有剩余。如果全国各个市镇的居民每户每月都像我家一样浪费三十多斤粮食，这给国家能造成多大的损失啊！经过我这一算细账，每月不但为国家节约了三十多斤粮食，而且自己每月还可以节省五元多钱，这对国家对自己都有好处。               （郝健记）
