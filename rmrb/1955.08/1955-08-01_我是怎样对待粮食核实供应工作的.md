How I Approached the Grain Verification and Supply Work
    Gong Yuhe

    When the grain verification and supply work began in Beijing in June, I still had many questions and concerns in my mind: Why is the government so strict about the grain supply work? Will those who live by labor and eat a lot be guaranteed enough? For example, I spend all day doing shoe-sewing work, and my family has many people, so we eat a lot. How should we set our grain consumption plan? As the director of the Ertiao Residents' Committee in Dongdan District, I also have to consider how to lead the street residents in setting a good plan. At that time, the masses also had many ideological concerns. They were generally afraid of setting the amount too low and not having enough to eat. Therefore, most residents set their grain consumption plans high, and the actual amount of grain purchased in June was lower than the plan. Because I myself was not clear about the government's policies and lacked work methods, I not only failed to persuade and help everyone set a good grain consumption plan, but also simply set my own grain consumption plan at 380 jin based on the average grain purchase amount from January to May (my family has eleven people, including three children aged four to fourteen). After the work group comrades held meetings, mobilized, and patiently explained, I realized the importance of this grain verification and supply work - if we don't plug the loopholes in the city's grain supply, we will not only fail to avoid wasting grain, but also allow unscrupulous merchants to take the opportunity to make huge profits, and the state will not be able to control the grain supply plan. This will not only affect socialist construction, but also be detrimental to the lives of urban residents. I realized that only by careful calculation and setting a good grain consumption plan can we eliminate grain waste and guarantee the people's reasonable needs.

    After my thinking was straightened out, I was determined to accurately calculate my family's grain consumption first; but I didn't know how to calculate accurately. Later, the comrades from the work group came to help me calculate in detail, and I realized that my grain consumption plan was set too high because I had included the grain consumed by guests in the past in my family's grain consumption plan for June. After recalculating, I revised my family's grain consumption amount to 310 jin for eleven people. This plan was approved by the street office. After the plan was approved, I thought that eating noodles is more expensive than eating rice. If we eat more rice and less noodles, and calculate the grain consumption amount according to the different amounts of noodles and rice, we can buy twelve jin less grain per month. So I immediately went to the street office and revised the grain consumption plan to 298 jin. By the end of June, the grain I purchased according to this plan was completely enough to eat.

    When setting the grain consumption plan for July, I had the experience of setting the grain consumption plan for June. I not only had the confidence to persuade the masses, but also had the methods to help everyone calculate in detail. Together with the street activists, I cooperated with the work group to go deep into each household, publicize policies, dispel the masses' concerns, and help each household carefully verify their grain consumption plan. In this verification work, we paid attention to analyzing the actual needs of the grain-consuming households. For example, those who live by heavy labor eat more and order more; families who are wealthy and do not work eat more non-staple food and order less, which is all reasonable.

    Because this work is very complicated, it is necessary to go deep into the masses, understand the situation, and help the masses solve specific problems. Therefore, for more than ten days, I couldn't do any work during the day and could only rush to work at night. Even so, I was happy because I helped the government do something in the grain verification and supply, which is good for everyone and myself. In July, most of the households we were responsible for verifying had set their grain consumption plans early, and the plans were relatively accurate. (Recorded by Cong Ying)

    我是怎样对待粮食核实供应工作的
    龚玉和
    六月份，北京市的粮食核实供应工作开始时，我心里还有许多疑问和顾虑：为什么政府对粮食供应工作抓得这样紧？靠劳动为生、吃得多的，是不是管饱？比如我整天做绱鞋活，家里人口又多，吃得也多，应该怎样订用粮计划？我是东单区二条居民委员会主任，还要考虑怎样领导街道居民把计划订好。当时群众的思想顾虑也很多，普遍怕定少了不够吃，因此大部分居民都把用粮计划订高了，六月份实际买的粮数都比计划低。因为我自己对政府的政策不明了，工作办法也少，不但没能说服和帮助大家订好用粮计划，而且自己的用粮计划也只是按照一月至五月份平均购粮数简单地订为三百八十斤（我家共有十一口人，其中有四至十四岁的孩子三人）。经过工作组同志开会动员和耐心解释，我才认识到这次粮食核实供应工作的重要性——如果不把城市粮食的漏洞堵死，不但不能避免对粮食的浪费，奸商也会趁机从中牟取暴利，国家就会不能掌握粮食供应计划，这不仅要影响社会主义建设，同时对城市居民的生活也是不利的。我认识到，只有精打细算，订好用粮计划，才能消灭粮食浪费，保证人民的合理需要。
    我的思想弄通了以后，就下决心把自己家的粮食用量先算确实；但是我不知道怎样才能算准确。后来，工作组的同志来帮助我算细账，我才知道我的用粮计划订得高了，原因是我把过去来客人吃掉的粮数也算在六月份家庭用粮计划里了。经过重新计算，我又把我家十一口人的用粮数量改订为三百一十斤。这个计划街道办事处批准了。计划批下后，我又想起，吃面比吃米费，如果多吃些米少吃些面，并按吃面吃米的不同数字计算用粮数量，一个月还可以少买十二斤粮食。于是我又马上到街道办事处，把用粮计划修改为二百九十八斤。到六月末，我按这个计划购买的粮食完全够吃。
    到订七月份用粮计划时，我有了订六月份用粮计划的经验，不但有信心去说服群众，也有办法去帮助大家算细账了。我同街道积极分子一起，配合工作组深入到各家各户，宣传政策，打消群众顾虑，帮助各户仔细地核实用粮计划。在这次核实工作中，我们注意了分析用粮户的实际需要。比如靠重劳动为生的吃得多，订得多些；生活富裕又不劳动的户，吃副食品多，订得少些，这些都是合理的。
    由于这项工作很繁杂，必须深入群众，了解情况，帮助群众解决具体问题，因此有十多天我白天一点活也不能干，只有在夜里赶活。虽然这样，我也是高兴的，因为我在粮食核实供应中帮助政府做了些事情，这事情对大家对自己都有好处。七月份我们负责核实的住户，大多数都提早订好了用粮计划，而且订的也比较确实。　　　　　（丛莹记）
