　　Oppose Turning Japan into an Atomic Military Base
　　Du Bo
    The U.S. Far East Command announced on the 22nd that the United States had shipped its atomic rocket launchers to Japan. According to Kyodo News, the troops equipped with these atomic weapons are used as offensive forces, and the U.S. military will soon conduct exercises with these weapons. This is the implementation of the U.S. plan to turn Japan into an atomic military base. It has aroused strong opposition from the Japanese people and caused significant anxiety among the Asian people. Japan is China's close neighbor, and the Chinese people resolutely oppose the action of turning Japan into an atomic military base.
    Japan is the first and has been the country repeatedly subjected to the disaster of American atomic weapons, and the wounds are still deeply felt. The Japanese people have been waging a resolute struggle to ban atomic weapons. The determination of the broad strata of the Japanese people to oppose atomic war and demand the prohibition of atomic weapons was fully expressed at the recent World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held in Hiroshima. Now, the United States, disregarding the common will of the Japanese people, has shipped atomic weapons to Japan, turning Japan into an atomic military base. The indignation expressed by the Japanese people over this incident is entirely understandable. The Japanese Communist Party has issued a statement demanding that the U.S. military in Japan take these atomic weapons back to the United States. The Japanese Leftist Socialist Party has expressed its demand that the U.S. military withdraw from Japan as soon as possible and transport the atomic rocket launchers back to the United States. The Japanese Rightist Socialist Party also expressed its intention to strengthen the struggle to oppose the plan of the United States and the Hatoyama government to turn Japan into a U.S. atomic military base. The propositions of the Japanese people and various political parties against turning Japan into a U.S. atomic military base have received the warm sympathy and support of the Chinese people.
    The United States transported atomic weapons to Japan behind the backs of the Japanese people with the consent of the Hatoyama government. The Director General of the Defense Agency of the Hatoyama government, Shigemasa Sunada, even said that the Japanese armed forces would soon receive training in the use of atomic weapons. This practice of the Hatoyama government violates the promises it made to the Japanese Diet and the Japanese people not long ago. Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu assured the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives on July 6 that the Japanese government "should make persistent efforts to prevent Japan from becoming an atomic bomb base." The facts now show that under pressure from the United States, the Japanese government has retracted its own promise, allowing Japan to become a U.S. atomic military base. This puts Japan at risk of suffering the disaster of atomic weapons once again and threatens the security of Asia.
    Now, the United States and the Japanese Hatoyama government are trying to paralyze the people, saying that this matter is insignificant, saying that because atomic warheads have not been sent. The U.S. side also said that shipping atomic weapons to Japan is only for training troops to "master the technology." Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu even said that atomic rocket launchers are different from atomic bombs and should be "regarded as ordinary weapons." These statements can't cover anything up. Atomic rocket launchers are for using atomic warheads and are certainly not ordinary weapons; the purpose of making troops proficient in the technology of using this weapon is even more obvious. Moreover, General White, commander of the U.S. Far East Army and the Eighth Army, said in a conversation on the 20th that in order for the atomic artillery unit to gain proficient technology, "it is necessary to fire large-caliber shells—in this case, atomic shells." This clearly admits that the U.S. military will use atomic warheads in Japan for training.
    After the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference, the entire international situation has begun to ease. All peace-loving people hope that the situation can be further eased. At this moment, the United States' shipping of atomic weapons to Japan can only increase the tension and anxiety in the Far East situation, and is therefore completely contrary to the wishes of the people of the world, especially the people of the Far East. The facts of the past few years have proved that the road contrary to the wishes of the people is a dead end. Some people may hope that this method can make Asians afraid of them, but that is an idea that ignores the facts. They should have known long ago that this idea is wrong.

### 反对把日本变成原子军事基地

　　反对把日本变成原子军事基地
　　杜波
    美国远东军司令部于二十二日宣布，美国已经把它的原子火箭发射器运到日本。据共同社消息，配有这种原子武器的部队是作为进攻部队使用的，美军即将就这种武器进行演习。这是美国方面把日本变成原子军事基地的计划的实施。它已经引起了日本人民强烈的反对，引起了亚洲人民重大的不安。日本是中国的紧邻，把日本变成原子军事基地的行动，中国人民是坚决反对的。
    日本是第一个而且是多次遭受美国原子武器灾祸的国家，至今创巨痛深。日本人民一直在为禁止原子武器进行坚决的斗争。日本广大阶层人民反对原子战争，要求禁止原子武器的决心，在最近广岛举行的禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会上充分表示出来了。现在，美国不顾日本人民的共同意志，却把原子武器运到日本，把日本变成原子军事基地。日本人民在这一事件上所表现的愤慨情绪，是完全可以理解的。日本共产党已经发表声明，要求驻日美军把这种原子武器带回美国去。日本左派社会党表示要求美军早日从日本撤退，同时把原子火箭发射器运回美国。日本右派社会党也表示要加强斗争，来反对美国和鸠山政府把日本变成美国原子军事基地的计划。日本人民和各政党反对把日本变成美国原子军事基地的主张得到了中国人民的热烈同情和支持。
    美国把原子武器背着日本人民运到日本，是得到鸠山政府的同意的。鸠山政府的防卫厅长官砂田重政并且说，日本的武装部队不久就将受到使用原子武器的训练。鸠山政府的这种作法，违背了它不久以前向日本国会和日本人民所作的诺言。日本外相重光葵七月六日向日本众议院外务委员会保证说，日本政府“应该进行持久的努力，使日本不至于成为原子弹基地”。现在的事实表明，日本政府在美国方面的压力之下，收回了它自己的诺言，容许日本变成美国的原子军事基地。这就使日本面临着再一次遭受原子武器灾祸的危险，使亚洲的安全受到威胁。
    现在，美国和日本鸠山政府正在力图麻痹人民，他们把这件事情说成无关紧要，说因为原子弹头并没送来。美国方面还说，把原子武器运到日本，只是为了训练部队“熟练技术”。日本外相重光葵更说，原子火箭发射器和原子弹不一样，要“把它当成普通的武器来看”。这些说法都是掩盖不了什么的。原子火箭发射器是为了使用原子弹头，当然不是普通武器；使部队熟练使用这种武器的技术，其目的更是非常明显。何况美国远东陆军司令兼第八军军长怀特在二十日的谈话中说过，为了使原子炮兵部队获得熟练技术，“有必要放射大口径的炮弹——在这个情况下是原子炮弹”。这明明已经承认美军在日本将使用原子弹头来进行训练。
    日内瓦四国首脑会议以后，整个国际局势已开始趋向缓和。所有愿望和平的人都希望局势能够进一步有所缓和。正在这个时候，美国把原子武器运到日本，只能增加远东局势的紧张和不安，因而是同世界人民，特别是远东人民的愿望完全相反的。几年来的事实证明，同人民愿望相反的道路是走不通的道路。有些人或者希望用这种办法可以使亚洲人害怕他们，那更是不顾事实的想法。他们应该早就知道这种想法是错误的。
