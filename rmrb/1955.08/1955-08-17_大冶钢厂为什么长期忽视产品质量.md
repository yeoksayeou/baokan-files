    Why the Daye Steel Plant Has Long Neglected Product Quality
    Cao Baoming, Xia Muyuan
    The main product of the Daye Steel Plant is high-quality steel, which is very important for the country's industrial construction, and the quality of the products must be excellent. However, for the past year and a half, the Daye Steel Plant has failed to fulfill this task. They not only frequently fail to deliver on time according to contracts, but the quality of the steel they produce has been consistently poor. Even more seriously, they have repeatedly passed off defective products as good ones.
    The bad behavior of failing to deliver on time and passing off bad products as good ones has caused great losses to many factories and projects that have ordered from the Daye Steel Plant. The Luoyang Engineering Bureau ordered a batch of steel bars from the Daye Steel Plant for the construction of the Jianhe Highway Bridge. The foundation of the highway bridge was built before March of this year, and steel bars were urgently needed to seal the bottom, in order to build the bridge piers out of the water before the flood. Due to the Daye Steel Plant's delay in delivering the goods according to specifications, and the fact that many of the steel bars that had been delivered were rusted and unusable, the progress of the bridge project was seriously affected. The Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant used steel materials from the Daye Steel Plant to manufacture parts for working machine tools. Because the steel materials were full of cracks, they were temporarily forced to stop work, which affected the plant and the cooperative factories that accepted the plant's processing orders from completing their plans. The Chongqing 101 Steel Plant ordered 1,300 tons of steel ingots from the Daye Steel Plant last year. Because the steel ingots had severe shrinkage cavities and were of poor quality, they had to be stockpiled and not used, which made it impossible for the 101 Plant to complete its production plan for the second quarter of last year, and 230,000 yuan of funds were tied up for nearly a year and could not be turned over.
    Deception and breach of trust have caused the Daye Steel Plant's reputation to plummet. The supply section of the Shanghai Tool Plant reflected that their material warehouse had become the Daye Steel Plant's waste product warehouse! More than 20 units under the Petroleum Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry do not order steel from the Daye Steel Plant. At two order meetings, many units were unwilling to order from the Daye Steel Plant, and 62 units that had already placed orders requested returns and compensation. According to the plant's statistics as of March of this year, a total of more than 2,000 tons of steel and steel ingots were definitely to be returned or had already been returned, resulting in a direct loss of 1.6 million yuan. As a result, the Daye Steel Plant was unable to deliver according to contract on the one hand, and on the other hand, it had more than 5 million yuan worth of products in stock that could not be sold. The plant's costs exceeded the budget by 1.22 million yuan in the first quarter of this year.
    The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Huangshi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China have conducted two inspections of the work of the Daye Steel Plant, criticized the capitalist management thinking and individualistic thinking of the plant's leading staff, and instructed the plant to take effective measures to improve management. The Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry has also hired Soviet experts to the Daye Steel Plant to help solve technical problems. Although the Daye Steel Plant has taken some measures to improve production work since May of this year, due to the lack of effective implementation by the leading staff, in addition to stopping the shipment of waste products, the product quality has not been truly improved. According to the statistics for the first 20 days of June, the pass rate of high-quality steel has decreased compared with May. The pass rate of non-annealed high-quality forged steel has decreased by 17%, and the pass rate of non-annealed high-quality rolled steel has decreased by 21%. More than half of the square bamboo-section steel they rolled had cracks.
    The problem of the Daye Steel Plant's poor product quality has been discovered for more than a year, but why can't it be improved? Of course, the technology for producing high-quality steel is relatively complex, and to improve product quality, it is necessary to start with improving technical management and improving the level of production technology, which has certain difficulties. But the most fundamental reason is that the leading staff of the Daye Steel Plant have capitalist management thinking and bourgeois individualism, and this erroneous thinking makes it impossible for them to solve technical problems and other problems.
    For example, in order to "complete" the profit plan, they once sold Class B steel from the Bessemer furnace as Class A steel, charging 50 yuan more per ton, and also sold open-hearth steel as electric furnace steel, charging 300 yuan more per ton. In this way, they successively overcharged users by 400,000 yuan. In June of last year, the plant had more than 1,000 tons of unplanned products in stock, and at the same time, it was 800 tons short of steel according to the contract. Zhang Yifeng, the deputy director of production (then acting director), approved the cancellation of several inspection items in order to "complete" the delivery task. As a result, the "pass rate" immediately soared, and a large number of waste products flowed to all parts of the country. The number of waste products shipped out of the factory in the second half of last year increased by 3.6 times compared with the first half of the year.
    In technical management, the leading staff of the Daye Steel Plant only paid lip service to implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts and relying on the masses. Since 1952, Soviet experts have often come to the plant to help solve technical problems in producing high-quality steel and have made many suggestions. But they have not even figured out how many suggestions the Soviet experts have made in total. Is there any technical difficulty in implementing the expert's suggestions? In fact, it is not the case. For example, in order to ensure product quality, Soviet experts suggested that the lime used for steelmaking should be dried and the moisture content should not exceed 0.5%. Drying lime is not technically difficult for the Daye Steel Plant, but they have not seriously implemented this suggestion for a long time. In the first 20 days of June this year, the moisture content of the lime used for steelmaking in the electric furnace workshop reached 0.6% or more 54 times. Regarding the "automatic demolding method," Soviet experts suggested that the side of the steel ingot mold should be cut into a slope, while the electric furnace workshop changed it to cut a slope on the side of the insulation cap. The plant leaders rewarded it without careful study, resulting in a large number of steel ingots being torn. Xia Zongqi, an engineer at the plant, once raised an opinion to the plant's leading staff. He refused to stamp his signature on the "qualification certificate" determined by relaxing the inspection standards, and also put forward 14 suggestions to strengthen technical supervision. However, the plant's leaders ignored it for a long time. From the subsequent regulations of the Iron and Steel Bureau on the trial production of new products, Xia Zongqi's suggestions were basically correct. However, this engineer who adhered to the principle on quality issues was attacked and was not assigned the work that an engineer should have assumed for more than half a year, until the Huangshi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China inspected the plant's problems at the beginning of this year, and this problem was solved.
    From an organizational point of view, the leading staff of the Daye Steel Plant have no organization and no discipline. They adopt a passive attitude towards the inspection and instructions of the higher-level party organizations, are indifferent to the cause of the party and the country, and are preoccupied with personal gains and losses. In October of last year, after the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China received letters of accusation from two party members of the plant regarding quality issues, it instructed the Huangshi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the plant's party committee to conduct a serious inspection and seriously deal with the incident of shipping waste products as a serious liability accident. When the Huangshi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China sent an inspection team for the first time, the plant's party committee did not seriously organize forces to cooperate. In the first quarter of this year, the plant's product quality continued to decline, and the phenomenon of shipping waste products was still serious. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Huangshi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized forces to conduct another inspection. Some members of the plant's party committee began to realize the seriousness of the problem and actively participated in this work. However, Li Zhenjiang, the secretary of the plant's party committee, still believed that the Huangshi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China did not take care of his "difficulties of just arriving at the steel plant," and described his attitude of not seriously implementing the instructions of the higher-level party committee as a personal difference of opinion between him and the deputy secretary of the municipal committee, trivializing a major problem. In particular, Zhang Yifeng (a party member), the deputy director of the plant who should be primarily responsible for the quality issue, even avoided some activities of the municipal party committee to study the quality issue. This caused the problem to be delayed, until the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China criticized the mistakes of Zhang Yifeng and Li Zhenjiang in May of this year, and they began to examine themselves. However, even now, some of them are still preoccupied with personal gains and losses and have not truly unified their thinking. In this way, it is naturally difficult to improve the poor product quality of the plant. No wonder the plant's employees also generally have the idea of valuing output over quality. In the first 20 days of June, the electric furnace workshop violated operating procedures more than 500 times, and the rolling mill workshop violated operating procedures more than 1,800 times.
    It is time! The Daye Steel Plant must change its poor product quality. Today, the people of the whole country are carrying out comprehensive conservation work to complete the first five-year plan, and it is absolutely not allowed to waste the strength of thousands of people and the funds of tens of millions of yuan endlessly.

    大冶钢厂为什么长期忽视产品质量
    曹葆铭　夏牧原
    大冶钢厂的主要产品是优质钢，这种钢在国家工业建设上有很重要的用途，产品的质量必须是优良的。但是，近一年半以来，大冶钢厂没有完成这个任务。他们不仅时常不遵照合同按期交货，而且生产的钢的品质一直是低劣的，更严重的是多次以废品冒充良品出卖。
    不按期交货、以坏品顶良品的恶劣行为，使许多向大冶钢厂订货的工厂和工程遭受了很大损失。洛阳工程局向大冶钢厂订了一批钢筋，是用来建设涧河公路桥的。公路桥基础工程早在今年三月以前就筑好了，急需用钢筋进行封底，以求在洪水前把桥墩修出水面。由于大冶钢厂迟迟不按规格交货，而已交出的钢筋有许多都已锈蚀不能使用，严重地影响了大桥工程的进度。沈阳第一机床厂用大冶钢厂的钢料制造工作母机部件，因为钢料裂纹累累，临时被迫停工，影响到该厂和接受该厂加工订货的协作工厂不能完成计划。重庆一○一钢铁厂去年向大冶钢厂订了一千三百吨钢锭，因为钢锭缩孔严重、品质低劣，只好积压不用，这就使一○一厂去年无法完成第二季度的生产计划，并且使二十三万元的资金被积压近一年不能周转。
    欺骗，不守信用的结果，使大冶钢厂的信誉扫地。上海工具厂供应科反映：他们的材料库变成了大冶钢厂的废品库了！燃料工业部石油工业局所属二十多个单位不订大冶钢厂的钢材。在两次订货会议上，许多单位都不愿向大冶钢厂订货，已经订了货的，有六十二个单位要求退货和赔款。据该厂截至今年三月的统计，肯定要退和已经退了的钢材、钢锭共有两千多吨，直接损失一百六十万元。这样一来，大冶钢厂一方面不能按合同交货，另一方面又积压了价值五百多万元的产品销不出去。该厂的成本今年第一季即超支一百二十二万元。
    中共湖北省委会和黄石市委会曾对大冶钢厂的工作进行了两次检查，批判了该厂领导工作人员的资本主义经营思想和个人主义思想，并指示该厂必须采取有效措施改进经营管理工作。重工业部钢铁工业局也先后聘请苏联专家到大冶钢厂帮助解决技术问题。从今年五月起，大冶钢厂虽然也采取了一些措施改进生产工作，但由于领导工作人员贯彻不力，除了制止废品出厂外，并没有真正改善产品质量。根据六月份前二十天的统计，优质钢材的合格率都比五月份降低，不退火的优质锻钢材的合格率降低了百分之十七、不退火的优质轧钢材的合格率降低了百分之二十一。他们轧制的方竹节钢，一半以上都有裂纹。
    大冶钢厂产品质量低劣的问题，从发现到现在已有一年多了，为什么还不能改善呢？当然，生产优质钢的技术是比较复杂的，想改善产品质量，必须从改善技术管理、提高生产技术水平入手，这方面有一定的困难。但最根本的原因还是由于大冶钢厂领导工作人员有资本主义经营思想和资产阶级个人主义思想，这种错误的思想使得他们无法解决技术问题和其他问题。
    例如，他们为了“完成”利润计划，曾经将贝氏炉的乙类钢冒充甲类钢出售，每吨多索价五十元，还曾经将平炉钢冒充电炉钢，每吨多索价三百元。他们就这样向用户先后多索取了四十万元。去年六月，该厂积压了一千多吨非计划产品，同时按合同规定又差八百吨钢材不能交货。生产副厂长张一峰（当时代理厂长）为了“完成”交货任务，竟批准取消了几项检验项目。于是，产品“合格率”立即飞跃上升，大量的废品流向全国各地，去年下半年出厂的废品比上半年增加了三点六倍。
    在技术管理工作上，大冶钢厂的领导工作人员只是空谈贯彻苏联专家建议，空谈依靠群众。从一九五二年起，苏联专家就常到该厂帮助解决生产优质钢的技术问题，曾提了许多建议。但他们连苏联专家一共提了多少建议都没有弄清楚。是不是在执行专家建议时技术上有困难呢？事实上并不是这样。例如，为了保证产品质量，苏联专家建议炼钢用的石灰要加以干燥，含水量不得超过百分之零点五。干燥石灰，对大冶钢厂来说在技术上是没有困难的，他们却长期没有认真贯彻这个建议。今年六月份的前二十天中，该厂电炉车间炼钢所用的石灰的含水量，有五十四次都达到百分之零点六以上。对“自动脱模法”，苏联专家建议在钢锭模边上削成斜坡，而该厂电炉车间自己改为在保温帽边上削成斜坡，该厂领导上未认真研究就予以奖励，结果造成大批钢锭拉裂。该厂工程师夏宗锜曾向厂的领导工作人员提出意见，他拒绝在放宽检验尺度所判定的“合格证”上盖章签字，也曾经提出了十四项加强技术监督的建议。但是该厂领导人员却长期置之不理。从后来钢铁局关于新产品试制工作的规定来看，夏宗锜的建议基本上是正确的。但是，这位在质量问题上坚持了原则的工程师却受到打击，半年多没有分配给他工程师所应担负的工作，直到中共黄石市委今年年初检查该厂问题时，才解决了这个问题。
    从组织方面看，大冶钢厂的领导工作人员是目无组织目无纪律的。他们对上级党组织的检查和指示采取消极应付的态度，对党和国家的事业漠不关心，斤斤计较个人得失。去年十月，中共湖北省委接到该厂两个党员对质量问题的检举信后，就指示中共黄石市委和该厂党委认真检查，把废品出厂事件当做严重的责任事故严肃处理。中共黄石市委第一次派检查组去时，该厂党委并未认真组织力量配合。今年第一季度，该厂产品质量继续下降，废品出厂现象依然严重，中共湖北省委和中共黄石市委又组织力量再次进行检查，该厂有的党委委员开始认识到问题的严重性，积极参加了这个工作。但是，该厂党委书记李振江却依然认为中共黄石市委不照顾他“刚到钢厂的困难”，并把他自己不认真执行上级党委指示的态度说成是他同市委副书记之间的个人意见分歧，把一个重大问题庸俗化了。特别是对质量问题应负主要责任的副厂长张一峰（党员），竟回避市委研究质量问题的一些活动。这就使问题拖延下来，直到今年五月中共湖北省委批判了张一峰、李振江的错误，他们才开始检查自己。但是，直到现在为止，他们有的还在计较个人得失，而没有把思想真正统一起来。这样，该厂产品质量低劣情况自然是难以改善。难怪该厂职工也普遍有重产量轻质量的思想，在六月份前二十天中，电炉车间违反操作规程达五百多次，轧钢车间达一千八百多次。
    已经是时候了！大冶钢厂必须改变产品质量低劣的状况。今天全国人民正为完成第一个五年计划而展开全面节约的工作，绝不容许上千人的力量和上千万元的资金这样无休止地浪费下去。
