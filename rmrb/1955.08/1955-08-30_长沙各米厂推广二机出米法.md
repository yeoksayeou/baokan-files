Changsha Rice Mills Promote the Two-Machine Rice Milling Method

The state-owned Changsha Xiangliang No. 1 Rice Processing Mill, accepting the suggestions of Soviet experts, adopted the "two-machine rice milling method" to mill rice, which improved the rice yield.

In the past, this factory used the "one-machine processing method" for rice milling. Due to the excessive pressure of the rice milling machine, the yield of whole rice was reduced. In May of this year, following the suggestions of Soviet experts, the "two-machine rice milling method" was adopted, reducing the pressure of the rice milling machine, and the broken rice rate was greatly reduced, increasing by more than 4.5 percent compared to the "one-machine processing method." This factory saved more than 300,000 jin of rice in June alone.

In mid-June of this year, the state-owned Changsha Xiangliang No. 6 Rice Processing Mill also adopted the "two-machine rice milling method." Trial milling results showed that not only was the broken rice rate reduced by 2.19 percent, but the finished product also had uniform bran removal and a bright color.

Currently, the "two-machine rice milling method" is being widely promoted in various state-owned rice mills in Changsha. (Li ZhenSheng, Wan GeFei)

　  长沙各米厂推广二机出米法
    国营长沙市湘粮第一加工米厂，接受苏联专家建议，采用“二机出米法”碾米，提高了出米率。
    这个厂，过去碾米采用“一机加工法”，因米车压力过高，减少了整米的出米率。今年五月，接受了苏联专家的建议，采用“二机出米法”，降低米车压力，碎米率大大减少，较“一机加工法”提高了百分之四点五以上。这个厂仅在今年六月份就节约稻谷三十多万斤。
    今年六月中旬，国营长沙市湘粮第六加工米厂也采用了“二机出米法”，试碾结果证明，不仅碎米率降低了百分之二点一九，而且成品出皮均匀，成色光彩。
    目前，“二机出米法”正在长沙市各公营米厂普遍推广。　（李振声、万格非）
