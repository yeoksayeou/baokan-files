Strengthening Leadership over Joint Medical Institutions
Hong Minggui, Deputy Director of the Urban Medical and Preventive Department of the Ministry of Health

Thanks to the leadership, advocacy, and support of the Party and the government, joint medical institutions (including joint hospitals, joint clinics, and joint maternal and child health stations) have greatly developed over the past five years. According to 1954 statistics, there were 99 joint hospitals, over 27,000 joint clinics, and over 700 joint maternal and child health stations nationwide. The number of medical personnel who had joined together accounted for approximately 21.6 percent of the total number of originally individually practicing medical personnel, of which approximately 20.3 percent were practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine, approximately 36.1 percent were Western medicine practitioners, and approximately 42.9 percent were midwives. In some large and medium-sized cities, the number of medical personnel who had joined together reached 80 percent of the total number of originally individually practicing medical personnel.

Facts have proven that organizing scattered medical personnel and establishing joint medical institutions is of great significance in the current national medical and preventive work: First, it can transform individual practice into collective cooperative undertakings, enabling participating members to divide labor and cooperate, help each other and benefit mutually, and give full play to the active role of each member. Second, it facilitates the organization of political and professional learning for medical personnel, as well as rotational training or advanced studies, in order to continuously improve their socialist consciousness and professional skills. Third, it can effectively assist the government in carrying out medical and preventive work and health propaganda, as well as maternal and child health care, and improve the public's health knowledge. Fourth, due to the gradual development of business and the gradual increase in public accumulation funds, it is possible to gradually add equipment, expand the scope of business, and facilitate people's access to medical treatment nearby. As long as the health departments provide planned leadership, the development of joint medical institutions will inevitably become a strong grassroots medical organization for implementing regionalized medical care in the future.

However, many joint medical institutions at present cannot reflect the advantages of this organizational form. Many shortcomings and problems still exist among them. In the process of organizing joint medical institutions, some regions have neglected the propaganda and education of the principle of voluntary mutual benefit; some regions have emphasized quantity over quality and blindly developed, and have not given due attention to the review of members' qualifications, which has brought many difficulties to the development, consolidation, and management of these institutions. Within some joint medical institutions, the organization and systems are very unsound, lacking democratic management, and financial management and accounting systems are also very chaotic. The distribution of income is very unreasonable: some have no accumulation or only stipulate very little public accumulation funds; some distribute wages equally, which affects the enthusiasm of participating members; some adopt the method of doctors sharing dividends from shares and other personnel receiving wages, which causes internal disunity. These problems seriously affect the consolidation and development of the collective undertaking of joint medical institutions. Health administrative departments at all levels should pay attention to them and quickly help them solve these problems.

One of the main reasons for these problems is that the health administrative leading departments do not have a sufficient understanding of the role of joint medical institutions, are not clear about their nature and the policies for supervision and management, lack extensive propaganda and education, and have not seriously cultivated typical examples, summarized and promoted good experiences. As a result, the management work of local health administrative departments and the joint medical institutions themselves lacks a basis, and the problems encountered cannot be solved in a timely manner. Until now, some health administrative cadres still have incorrect views on joint medical institutions. Some believe that private joint medical institutions are of a private nature and do not require much effort to lead; some believe that joint medical institutions are private enterprises, and the so-called "employment" relationship within them cannot be resolved, so it cannot but affect the enthusiasm of doctors and hinder the unity between members; some simply regard them as "social welfare undertakings" and allow them to exist and develop naturally; some believe that joint clinics are not formal, small in scale, and do not play as big a role as formal hospitals and outpatient departments, and do not pay attention to them at all, and some even adopt discriminatory and exclusionary attitudes, establishing medical stations or outpatient departments near joint medical institutions, creating an unreasonable phenomenon of overlapping medical institutions and wasting manpower and material resources. Within the joint medical institutions and among the vast number of practicing medical personnel, the understanding of the nature and role of joint medical institutions, as well as how to manage them, is also unclear. They often inquire about this matter with the health departments. Some institutions, factories, and the masses believe that joint medical institutions are privately run and are unwilling to seek medical treatment there or establish medical relations with them. These situations have affected the development of joint medical institutions and the full play of medical forces, so that some joint medical institutions that have been established for many years and have good business conditions, their members have also generated negative thoughts such as turning over to public management, dismantling and disbanding, and waiting and seeing. If this situation is not corrected and allowed to develop, it will be detrimental to the people's health cause.

The role of joint medical institutions in the health cause deserves attention from all parties. At the National Conference on Cultural and Educational Work convened by the State Council in May of this year, the nature of joint medical institutions was clearly stated: Joint medical institutions are social health and welfare undertakings of a cooperative nature voluntarily organized by medical personnel (and some administrative staff) engaged in independent mental labor. The reason for defining its nature in this way is that it is organized under the leadership, advocacy, and support of the Party and the government to ensure the people's medical and health needs; its members voluntarily participate and personally participate in labor; its organizational principle is democratic centralism, and it has democratic management organizations and systems, and the rights of members are equal; the opening expenses are raised by members (or some members), and then gradually repaid from the public accumulation funds, so that the public property of the institution is collectively owned; the income is distributed according to management fees, public accumulation funds, wages, and welfare items, and the wages are assessed according to the principle of "distribution according to work"; it can complete certain medical prevention and health and epidemic prevention tasks assigned by the state, and serve to protect the health of the broad masses of the people.

Joint medical institutions are a powerful assistant to medical institutions run by the state and are an organizational form that meets the needs of the people's health care cause. Local health administrative departments should, under the leadership of the local Party committees and people's committees, gradually incorporate joint medical institutions into the national health work plan in accordance with the principle of "active leadership, improving quality, rational deployment, overall planning, and giving full play to potential," and treat them as an indispensable force in urban and rural medical prevention work, assign special personnel to manage them carefully, and earnestly rectify them. In the future, joint medical institutions should be developed steadily with leadership and planning, and strictly prevent the tendencies of blind advancement, forced orders, and spontaneous organization. In the process of development, the participating members should be strictly reviewed, and the principle of voluntary mutual benefit should be adhered to; each member must actively participate in the work personally, and generally should take full-time work as the principle; the location of the clinic should be uniformly studied and decided by the health administrative department according to actual needs; in business, it can take the form of a combination of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, or Western medicine. In rural areas, it should be appropriately developed mainly in towns or larger villages with concentrated populations, and the working methods should also adapt to the decentralized characteristics of rural areas to facilitate service for agricultural production.

Health administrative departments at all levels should actively manage joint medical institutions, attach importance to and give play to their role, strengthen political and ideological leadership, improve the political and ideological awareness of each member, correct the attitude of serving the people, improve the style of medical work, help them overcome the shortcomings in organization and management, and solve the major problems existing at present. In terms of business guidance, a certain hospital or outpatient department should be designated to establish consultation, referral, and transfer systems with them, organize business learning, and assign certain medical tasks according to the situation, so that they become a component of the medical prevention network. Widely and deeply publicize the advantages of joint medical institutions, so that the medical personnel who have joined together and the vast number of practicing medical personnel and the broad masses of the people have a clear understanding of them. In terms of organization and management, those joint medical institutions that basically meet the requirements and also have some problems should be rectified, consolidated, improved, and strengthened in management; those that have not been approved or are not actually joint clinics and so-called "collective clinics" should be persuaded to change to private clinics according to their specific circumstances, and those that have the conditions for joining together can be organized to implement the joint operation under leadership.

Joint medical institutions should actively rely on the leadership of the Party and the government, adopt the organizational principle of democratic centralism, take the members' congress as the highest management organization form, major issues should be decided through the congress, and the management committee (small joint medical institutions with few members may not set up a management committee) and the heads of hospitals, clinics, and stations should be elected and work with the approval of the health administrative department. In joint medical institutions, attention should be paid to correcting the patriarchal and harmonious leadership style and the tendency of extreme democracy; work and study systems should be established (such as inspection, reporting, political and professional learning, etc.), give full play to organizational effectiveness and the enthusiasm of each member; strengthen financial management, establish a sound accounting system, and report the annual and quarterly income and expenditure to the general assembly of all members and the health administrative department regularly, practice frugality and economy, overcome extravagance and waste, and thoroughly rectify institutions with no accounts or chaotic financial systems.

Regarding opening expenses, after the institution has a certain economic foundation, it should be gradually repaid from the principal repayment fund, generally giving bank interest or honorary rewards; the method of sharing dividends from shares should gradually implement the method of not sharing dividends. When a member withdraws due to some reason, they have no right to withdraw public property, and when their individual opening expenses (including the depreciated equipment and furniture) have not been repaid, they can be repaid once or in installments without affecting the normal operation of the institution. In terms of income distribution, the percentage of management fees, public accumulation funds, wages, welfare funds, bonus funds, and other items should be stipulated according to the business income and expenditure of joint medical institutions in various places. The public accumulation fund is the material basis for the development of collective undertakings, and should be gradually expanded with the development of business and used to enrich medical equipment and develop business. Welfare funds and bonus funds should also be reasonably controlled. Welfare funds should generally be applied to the collective cultural welfare of members and appropriately solve the difficulties of members; bonus funds should be applied to correct rewards. Correctly use welfare funds and bonus funds to encourage the enthusiasm of each member. In terms of wage forms, there are also various types at present. The unreasonable wage (such as "labor return") distribution methods must be changed in the process of rectification. In the initial stage of establishment, the method of "fixed scores and flexible accounting" can be adopted, that is, the salary "basic scores" of each member are democratically assessed. The value of the "basic scores" is determined by the salary part of the monthly income. This method is more reasonable on the basis of fixing a certain percentage of the public accumulation fund or principal repayment fund and in the case of preliminary business development; after the business has a relatively solid foundation, a salary system that is democratically assessed according to technical level, work attitude, and other conditions should be implemented. These two methods are determined according to the principle of "distribution according to work" and are in line with the nature of joint medical institutions. Therefore, it can encourage the enthusiasm and creativity of members and strengthen the sense of responsibility for patients and collective undertakings.

Strengthening the leadership of health administrative departments at all levels over joint medical institutions and rectifying joint medical institutions are all aimed at continuously improving the quality of joint medical institutions to meet the needs of the development of the people's health cause. Health administrative departments at all levels and the medical workers who have joined together should actively strive to overcome the shortcomings in the development process, improve their work, and give better play to the role of joint medical institutions. In particular, health administrative departments in various places must conscientiously implement the spirit of the National Conference on Cultural and Educational Work, combine it with the specific conditions of their localities, pay attention to cultivating typical examples, summarize experience, use typical examples to guide the general, so that the existing joint medical institutions truly become social health and welfare undertakings of a cooperative nature after rectification; when redeveloping joint medical institutions, it is also necessary to correctly combine quality and quantity, needs and possibilities. Only in this way can we continuously expand the prestige of joint medical institutions among the masses and give full play to their potential strength, so that they truly play the role of a powerful assistant to medical institutions run by the state.

    加强对联合医疗机构的领导
    卫生部城市医疗预防司副司长  洪明贵
    由于党和政府的领导、提倡和扶助，五年来，联合医疗机构（包括联合医院、联合诊所、联合妇幼保健站）有了很大的发展。根据一九五四年的统计，全国已有联合医院九十九所，联合诊所二万七千多所，联合妇幼保健站七百多所；联合起来的医务人员约占原有个体开业医务人员总数百分之二十一点六，其中中医师约占百分之二十点三，西医师约占百分之三十六点一，助产士约占百分之四十二点九。有些大中城市联合起来的医务人员达原有个体开业医务人员总数百分之八十。
    事实证明：把散在的医务人员组织起来，建立联合医疗机构，在当前国家医疗预防工作中有着很大的意义：第一，能把个人开业转化为集体合作事业，使参加成员分工合作，互助互利，发挥每个成员的积极作用；第二，便于组织医务人员的政治学习、业务学习，以及轮训或进修，以便不断提高他们的社会主义觉悟和业务技术水平；第三，能有效地协助政府进行医疗预防工作和卫生宣传、妇幼保健工作，提高人民群众的卫生知识；第四，由于业务的逐步发展，公积金逐渐增多，有可能逐步增添设备，扩大业务范围，便利群众就近就医。只要卫生部门有计划地加以领导，联合医疗机构的发展，必然可以成为今后实行划区医疗的有力的基层医疗组织。
    但是，目前有着不少的联合医疗机构还不能体现联合医疗机构这一组织形式的优越性，它们中间还存在着许多缺点和问题。在组织联合医疗机构的过程中，有的地区忽视了自愿互利原则的宣传教育；有的地区只重数量不重质量，盲目发展，对成员条件的审查也未给予应有的注意，这就给这些机构的发展、巩固和管理带来了不少困难。在某些联合医疗机构内部，组织、制度很不健全，缺乏民主管理，财务管理和会计制度也非常混乱，收入的分配很不合理：有的没有积累或只规定很少的公积金；有的工薪平均分配，影响了参加成员的积极性；有的采取医师入股分红，其它人员工薪制的办法，引起内部的不团结。这些问题严重地影响了联合医疗机构集体事业的巩固和发展，各级卫生行政部门应当予以重视，并迅速帮助他们解决。
    产生这些问题的主要原因之一，是卫生行政领导部门对联合医疗机构的作用认识不足，对它的性质和监督管理的方针政策不明确，缺乏广泛的宣传教育，也没有认真培养典型，总结和推广好的经验，以致各地方卫生行政部门和联合医疗机构本身的管理工作无所依据，遇到的问题也不能及时得到解决。直到目前为止，还有些卫生行政干部对联合医疗机构存在着不正确的看法，有的认为私人联合医疗机构是私人性质的，用不着花很大力量去领导；有的认为联合医疗机构是私人企业，其内部的所谓“雇佣”关系不可能解决，所以也就不能不影响医师们的积极性，妨害成员间的团结；有些人则仅仅视之为“社会福利事业”，听其自然存在和发展；有的认为联合诊所不正规，规模小，不如正规的医院、门诊部起的作用大，根本不予重视，甚而还有人采取歧视、排挤的态度，在联合医疗机构附近建立医疗站或门诊部，造成医疗机构重叠，浪费人力物力的不合理现象。而在联合医疗机构内部和广大开业医务人员中，对联合医疗机构的性质和作用，以及如何管理，在认识方面也是不明确的，他们经常向卫生部门打听这件事情。部分机关、工厂和群众则认为联合医疗机构是私人办的，不愿意去看病，不愿意同它们建立医疗关系。这些情况都影响了联合医疗机构的发展和医疗力量的充分发挥以致目前有些已经成立多年的、业务情况很好的联合医疗机构，它们的成员也因为这些影响产生了归公接办、拆台散伙和等待观望等消极思想，这一情况如不纠正而让它发展下去，那对人民的卫生事业是不利的。
    联合医疗机构在卫生事业中的作用，值得各方面重视。在今年五月间国务院召开的全国文教工作会议上，对联合医疗机构的性质已经作了明确的说明：联合医疗机构是由独立脑力劳动的医务人员
  （及部分行政事务人员）自愿组织起来的合作社性质的社会卫生福利事业。这样来确定它的性质，是因为它是在党和政府的领导、提倡和扶助下为保证人民的医疗保健需要而组织起来的；它的成员是自愿参加和亲自参加劳动的；它的组织原则是民主集中制，而且有着民主管理的组织和制度，成员的权利是平等的；开办费是由成员（或部分成员）筹集的，而后逐步由公积金内偿还，使机构的公共财产为集体所有；收入是按管理费、公积金、工资福利等项目分配，工资是根据“按劳取酬”的原则评定的；它能完成国家交给的一定医疗预防及卫生防疫任务，为保护广大人民群众的健康服务。
    联合医疗机构是国家举办的医疗机构的有力助手，是符合人民卫生保健事业需要的一种组织形式。各地卫生行政部门应在各地党委和人民委员会的领导下，依照“积极领导，提高质量，合理部署，统筹安排，发挥潜力”的原则，逐步地将联合医疗机构纳入国家卫生工作计划，当成城乡医疗预防工作中不可缺少的力量，指定专人认真地管理起来，并切实地加以整顿。今后联合医疗机构，应有领导、有计划地稳步发展，严格防止盲目冒进、强迫命令和自发组织的偏向。在发展过程中，对参加成员应当加以严格审查，并坚持自愿互利的原则；每个成员必须是积极亲自参加工作，一般应以整日工作为原则；诊所地点应根据实际需要，由卫生行政部门统一研究决定；在业务上可采取中西医、中医或西医联合的形式。在农村，主要是在人口集中的镇或较大的村庄，根据需要适当地发展，在工作方法上也要适应农村分散的特点，便于为农业生产服务。
    各级卫生行政部门应积极地将联合医疗机构管起来，重视和发挥它们的作用，加强政治思想领导，提高每个成员的政治思想觉悟，端正为人民服务的态度，改进医疗工作作风，帮助他们克服组织管理上的缺点，解决当前存在的重大问题。在业务指导方面，应指定一定的医院或门诊部同它们建立会诊、转诊、转院制度，组织业务学习，并根据情况分配一定的医疗任务，使其成为医疗预防网的组成部分。广泛深入地宣传联合医疗机构的优越性，使联合起来的医务人员和广大的开业医务人员以及广大人民群众对其有一个明确的认识。在组织管理方面，对那些基本上符合要求同时又存在一些问题的联合医疗机构，要加以整顿、巩固、提高，并加强管理；对那些未经批准或实际上不成为联合诊所以及所谓“集体诊所”的，应根据其具体情况，有的应说服其改为私人诊所，对具备了联合条件的则可有领导地组织他们实行联合。
    联合医疗机构应当主动依靠党和政府的领导，采取民主集中制的组织原则，以成员大会为最高管理的组织形式，重大问题通过大会来决定，并选出管理委员会（小型的成员少的联合医疗机构，可不设管理委员会）及院、所、站长，经卫生行政部门批准进行工作。在联合医疗机构里应当注意纠正家长式的、一团和气的领导作风和极端民主的倾向；应当建立工作、学习制度（如检查、汇报、政治和业务学习等制度），充分发挥组织效能和每个成员的积极性；加强财务管理，建立健全的会计制度，年度和季度收支情况应定期向全体成员大会和卫生行政部门报告，厉行精简节约，克服铺张浪费现象，对无账目或财务制度混乱的机构应进行彻底整顿。
    关于开办费，在机构有了一定的经济基础之后，逐渐由还本金中偿还，一般给与银行利息或名誉奖励；采取入股分红办法的应逐步实行不分红的办法。成员因故退出时，无提取公共财产的权利，而其个人所出开办费（包括所出器材、家具折算的）未还完时，在不影响机构正常进行业务的条件下，可一次或分次偿还。在收入分配方面，应根据各地联合医疗机构的业务收支情况，规定管理费、公积金、工资、福利金、奖励金等项目的百分比。公积金是集体事业发展的物质基础，随着业务的发展应逐步扩大，用于充实医疗设备，发展业务。对福利金、奖励金亦应合理掌握，福利金一般应用于成员的集体的文化福利方面，适当解决成员的困难；奖励金应用于正确的奖励方面。正确地使用福利金、奖励金，使能起到鼓励每个成员工作积极性的作用。在工资形式上，目前也是多种多样的，对那些不合理的工资（如“劳动返还金”）分配办法，必须在整顿的过程中加以改变。在成立初期，可采取“死分活计”的办法，即民主评定每个成员的工薪“底分”，“底分”分值是按每月收入的工资部分来决定，这种办法在固定了一定百分比的公积金或还本金的基础上，和业务初步开展的情况下是较合理的；在业务有了比较稳固的基础后，应实行按技术程度、工作态度等条件民主评定的工资制。这两种办法，都是根据“按劳取酬”的原则来确定的，是符合联合医疗机构的性质的，因此，它能鼓励成员的积极性和创造性，并能加强对病人和集体事业的责任心。
    加强各级卫生行政部门对联合医疗机构的领导，整顿联合医疗机构，其目的都是为了不断地提高联合医疗机构的质量，以适应人民卫生事业发展的需要。各级卫生行政部门和联合起来的医务工作者们，应积极努力，克服发展过程中的缺点，改进工作，以更好地发挥联合医疗机构的作用。尤其各地卫生行政部门，必须认真贯彻全国文教工作会议的精神，结合本地的具体情况，注意培养典型，总结经验，以典型指导一般，使现有的联合医疗机构在整顿之后，真正成为合作社性质的社会卫生福利事业；重新发展联合医疗机构时，也必须将质量和数量、需要和可能正确地结合起来。只有这样，才能不断扩大联合医疗机构在群众中的威信，充分发挥它的潜在力量，使它真正起到国家举办的医疗机构的有力助手作用。
