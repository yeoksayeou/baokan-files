    The sinking speed of Yangtze River Bridge Caissons is Accelerating
    During the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the Gu Baonian hoisting work team set a new record of sinking a reinforced concrete caisson in three hours and fifty-two minutes when sinking the No. 2 bridge pier, which is one-third faster than the highest speed achieved by the bridge builders when sinking caissons for the No. 1 bridge pier.
    Most of the members of the Gu Baonian work team are young soldiers and young workers from the Railway Corps who recently came to learn the technology. From the No. 1 pier site to the No. 2 pier site, after several months of learning and training, under the guidance of Soviet experts, they gradually became familiar with the complex technology of sinking caissons and learned to carry out joint labor among various types of work during construction.
    The average sinking speed of all the caissons for this pier is more than 50% faster than the sinking speed of the caissons for the No. 1 bridge pier. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    长江大桥管柱下沉速度加快
    在武汉长江大桥施工中，顾宝年装吊工班在下沉二号桥墩的钢筋混凝土管柱时，创造了三小时零五十二分下沉一根的新纪录，比建桥工人们在一号桥墩下沉管柱时的最高速度又加快了三分之一。
    顾宝年工班里大多数是不久前新来学习技术的铁道兵部队的青年战士和青年工人。他们从一号墩址到二号墩址，经过几个月的学习和锻炼，在苏联专家的指导下，逐渐熟悉了下沉管柱的复杂的技术，而且学会了在施工中进行各工种的联合劳动。
    这个桥墩全部管柱下沉速度平均比一号桥墩下沉管柱时提高百分之五十以上。（据新华社讯）
