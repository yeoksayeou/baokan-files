Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd—Commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army warmly celebrated the successful closing of the Second Session of the National People's Congress and expressed their determination to support the resolutions of the conference with practical actions to defend the motherland.

    On the morning of July 31st, when the newspapers carrying the news of the successful closing of the conference were delivered to the position of the 6th Company of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit on the coastal defense front, the commanders and fighters immediately read them aloud on the position. The gunners held discussions right next to the cannons.

    During the days of the Second Session of the National People's Congress, the commanders and fighters of various arms of the services on the Fujian front were concerned about the conference's progress every day. They carefully read the report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, as well as the reports on the Military Service Law, the Comprehensive Plan for Fundamentally Controlling the Yellow River Floods and Developing the Yellow River Water Conservancy. The blackboard newspaper at the position of the 2nd Company of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit on the Xiamen front continuously introduced the main content of the First Five-Year Plan. The commanders and fighters of this company had shot down or damaged twelve Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft in the struggle to defend the motherland's coastal defense. Gunner Wang Wenjin said, "Our ability to achieve victory in the fight against Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft is inseparable from the country's industrialization. We must defend the smooth implementation of the country's First Five-Year Plan." Commanders and fighters whose homes were along the Yellow River, after seeing the news about fundamentally controlling the Yellow River, wrote letters home, encouraging relatives and friends to participate in this great construction.

    The People's Liberation Army commanders and fighters unanimously expressed their determination to defend the victorious realization of the First Five-Year Plan with practical actions. Liu Zhende, a model security guard and deputy company commander of the Public Security Forces, said, "The enemies of the people will not be reconciled to our realization of the First Five-Year Plan. We must redouble our vigilance and resolutely eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries." Liu Zhende had led soldiers in arresting forty-four Chiang Kai-shek's armed agents and bandits in a single operation in the struggle to defend national economic construction. The commanders and fighters attached importance to practicing strict economy to support the country's construction and discussed specific ways to implement it. Lou Jian道, a Communist Party member in a certain unit stationed in Nanjing who was responsible for warehouse work, said, "I guarantee to do a good job in storage conscientiously, not to damage or waste any materials, save state expenditure, and support socialist construction." The soldiers of the agricultural production and construction corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army expressed their determination to carry out labor competitions and strive to overfulfill production tasks. Li Shengzhu, a special-class meritorious worker and cotton planting expert from a certain mechanized farm, proposed that he would guarantee that the twelve mu of cotton fields he managed would produce an average of more than one thousand jin of unginned cotton for the state per mu.

    新华社三日讯　中国人民解放军各部队的指挥员和战斗员热烈欢庆全国人民代表大会第二次会议胜利闭幕，并表示要以保卫祖国的实际行动拥护会议的各项决议。
    七月三十一日上午，刊载会议胜利闭幕消息的报纸送到海防前线高射炮某部第六连阵地上的时候，指战员们立刻在阵地上朗读起来，炮手们就在大炮旁边进行了座谈。
    在全国人民代表大会第二次会议进行的这些日子内，福建前线各兵种部队的指战员们每天都在关心着会议的情况。他们仔细地阅读了关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告和有关兵役法、根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划等报告。厦门前线高射炮某部第二连阵地的黑板报上，连续介绍了第一个五年计划的主要内容。这个连的指战员们曾经在保卫祖国海防的斗争中击落击伤了十二架蒋贼飞机。炮手王文进说：“我们能够在和蒋贼飞机作战中取得胜利，是和国家工业化分不开的。我们一定要保卫国家第一个五年计划顺利实施。”家住在黄河沿岸的指战员们，在看到关于根治黄河的消息后，纷纷写信回家，鼓励亲友参加这一伟大建设。
    人民解放军指战员们一致表示要以实际行动保卫第一个五年计划的胜利实现。公安部队警备模范、副连长刘振德说：“人民的敌人对我们实现第一个五年计划是不会甘心的，我们一定要加倍提高警惕，坚决肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子。”刘振德曾在保卫国家经济建设的斗争中率领战士一次逮捕过四十四名蒋贼武装特务、土匪等。指战员们重视厉行节约来支援国家的建设，并且讨论了具体实行的办法。驻南京部队某部负责仓库工作的共产党员楼建道说：“我保证认真地做好保管工作，不损坏、不浪费一点物资，节省国家开支，支援社会主义建设。”人民解放军新疆军区农业生产建设部队的战士们表示要开展劳动竞赛，争取超额完成生产任务。某机械农场特等功臣、植棉能手李生珠提出，他要保证自己管理的十二亩棉田平均每亩地给国家生产籽棉一千斤以上。
