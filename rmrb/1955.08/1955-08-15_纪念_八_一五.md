    Commemorating "August 15th"
    By Korean Writer Li Kiyong
    The Korean people, in an environment of solemn struggle for the peaceful reunification and independence of their country and the restoration and construction of the people's economy after the war, are welcoming the tenth anniversary of "August 15th," the day our country was liberated. "August 15th" is the day our nation was reborn thanks to the great Soviet armed forces, and a demonstration of the glorious victories achieved by the Korean people after liberation.
    In the past ten years, all sectors of our people's political, economic, cultural, and social life have been filled with great changes and victories won in the struggle for the independence, freedom, and happiness of the country. We look back on this victorious path with joy and pride.
    Korea is one of the countries with the longest history in the world, and the Korean people are peace-loving and hard-working people. However, during the decades of vicious colonial rule by Japanese imperialism, not a single day was peaceful in the lives of the Korean people. Terrible poverty and suffering dominated their lives, and they had no freedom or rights whatsoever.
    In particular, in order to wage its war of aggression against China, Japanese imperialism implemented even more sinister colonial policies against the Korean people.
    Our national culture was brutally devastated, and we were forced to accept the criminal so-called "Imperialization" policy.
    Japanese imperialism committed indescribable atrocities against our people, who have a long national tradition and a brilliant national culture, attempting to deprive us of our language, writing, and even our names.
    Prisons were filled with our patriotic heroes, and the people's lives were plunged into unspeakable misery. But the vicious Japanese imperialism could not crush the national integrity and conscience of each of our people. The Korean people bravely rose up to fight for their liberation and freedom. The victory of the great October Revolution further encouraged this just struggle.
    The anti-Japanese guerrillas, led by Marshal Kim Il-sung, the beloved leader of the Korean people, continued their heroic armed struggle until the day of Korea's liberation.
    Through this struggle, a solid internationalist friendship was forged between the Korean people and the peoples of the Soviet Union and China, which has been constantly expanding and strengthening.
    On the day we welcomed "August 15th," the day we welcomed the great liberators, the three thousand-li land was seething with cheers of joy and gratitude.
    On that day, the sun seemed particularly bright, as if blessing the liberated Korean people. Mount Paektu raised its head, welcoming this new day. The birds flying in the sky also sang for liberation. Even the ignorant plants and trees seemed to be rejoicing. The people of this country, men, women, old, and young, filled with the joy of liberation, thronged to the squares and streets. They hailed liberation and praised the great achievements of the Soviet army.
    Our people called the Soviet army "liberators" and "helpers" and loved them like family.
    After liberation, under the different circumstances in North and South Korea, the Korean people, under the leadership of our beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung and the Korean Workers' Party, in the northern half of the Republic, taking advantage of the favorable conditions created by the great Soviet army, embarked on the road of creating a strong revolutionary democratic base. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, vitality like an inexhaustible spring gushed out from among our people.
    The historically significant democratic reforms and democratic construction carried out in the northern half of our country during the five years after liberation turned the northern half into a powerful revolutionary democratic base for the reunification and independence of the country, enabling the people of the northern half to live a free and happy new life.
    All this was not to the liking of the imperialists, who attempted to turn our already liberated country back into their colony and to use our country as a springboard for their aggression against the great Soviet Union and the newborn People's Republic of China. They finally launched a war of aggression against our country and people on June 25, 1950.
    In the arduous fighting environment against the American armed aggressors and their lackeys, our people and the outstanding sons and daughters of the great Chinese people fought side by side. Under the lofty banner of proletarian internationalism of "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Homeland," the Chinese people organized the Chinese People's Volunteers to rush to the Korean front. They displayed unparalleled heroism and indomitable spirit on the banks of the Chongchon River, by Changjin Lake, in the Han River basin, and on Triangle Hill, inflicting fatal blows on the enemy and achieving brilliant victories. In particular, we will never forget the noble names of the sons and daughters of the Chinese people, the great internationalist fighters Huang Jiguang, Qiu Shaoyun, and Luo Shengjiao, and other martyrs. The selfless assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers to the Korean people completely shattered the American aggressors' attempt to annex our country in one fell swoop in the face of the heroic Korean people. The Korean people achieved a historically significant victory in the Fatherland Liberation War.
    The Korean people gloriously defended the freedom and independence of their country, defended the democratic base, and made a great contribution to defending peace in the Far East and the world. After three years of hard war, the Korean people suffered deep disasters. After the armistice, we turned to peaceful labor for recovery and construction. No matter how serious the wounds of the war may be, they cannot stop the solemn progress of our people. The Korean people have triumphed and are marching towards new victories.
    In the past ten years, the Korean people have achieved extremely great victories in the struggle for the freedom, independence, and people's democratic construction of their country. Among them, the achievements in literature and art are also remarkable. The "August 15th" liberation obtained by the Korean people relying on the great Soviet army has opened up infinitely broad avenues for the development of our country's literature and art. In the past, under the barbaric rule of Japanese imperialism, literary and art workers who were deprived of the right to write for their people and the freedom to engage in creative activities, and even deprived of the right to write in their own national language, can not only freely engage in activities in the northern half of the motherland after liberation, but also write many excellent works reflecting the powerful reality of life with realistic creative methods under the enthusiastic love of the people and the constant and profound care and guidance of the Party and the government.
    At the same time, our writers' ranks have rapidly expanded due to the absorption of a large number of literary and art workers from the liberated working people of our country. Our writers' ranks, which numbered only one hundred writers after the "August 15th" liberation, have now reached two thousand five hundred. Our literary and art workers creatively absorbed the advanced creative methods and experiences of socialist realism from the advanced literature and art of the fraternal countries, headed by the great Soviet Union, while going deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, studying Marxist-Leninist aesthetics, and enthusiastically implementing the correct literary and art policies of our Party.
    The talk of our beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung to writers and artists in June 1951 has become a creative program for our country's writers and artists. Following this creative program, our country's literary and artistic undertakings have made many achievements. During the five years of peaceful democratic construction after liberation, our literary and artistic works mainly focused on the happy life of our people who became the masters of the land, factories, and political power after liberation, as well as the patriotism and Korean-Soviet friendship manifested in their lives. At the same time, during this period, reflecting the miserable life of the people in the southern half of the Republic and the heroic struggle of the patriotic people in the southern half was also one of the themes of our literary and artistic works.
    By the time of the Fatherland Liberation War, the themes of our literary and artistic works became more diverse, and more excellent works were produced. During this period, our literary and art workers took the reflection of the heroic struggle of our people in the front and rear, the high degree of hatred of our people for the American imperialist armed aggressors and their lackeys, Korean-Soviet friendship, and Korean-Chinese friendship as the basic themes of their creation, and created works required by our people. As a result, excellent works such as Han Xueye's novel "The Taedong River," Zhao Jitian's poems "Korea is Fighting" and "On the Burning Streets," Hong Chunzhe's poem "Glory to You," as well as the play "Coal Miners," and the films "People Defending Their Hometowns," "Young Guerrilla Team," and "Scout" appeared.
    The music and dance departments have also created many successful works, among which the most outstanding works are the songs "By the Spring," "Song of the Car Driver," and "Song of the Scout," as well as "Korean Mother" compiled by Cui Chenghui.
    During the post-war recovery and construction period, our literary and art departments also created many successful works that educated the people with patriotic and proletarian internationalist ideas.
    These achievements of our country's literary and art departments after liberation have been achieved through a relentless struggle against naturalism and formalism tendencies that distorted our Party's literary and artistic policies and socialist realism.
    Our country's literary and art departments have many favorable conditions: it has many talented and experienced writers, it is constantly cared for by the Party, the government, and the people, and it can draw on the experiences of the Soviet Union and People's China. These great victories achieved by our people during the ten years after the "August 15th" liberation will be recorded in golden letters in our country's history and will shine forever.
    The Korean people have clearly realized through their own experience that the solid friendship and unity between the Korean people and the people of the fraternal countries, headed by the great Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, is a solid guarantee of our victory. Therefore, on the occasion of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the "August 15th" liberation, our people will raise even higher the ever-victorious banner of proletarian internationalism, and in the struggle for the peaceful reunification and independence of the country, and in the struggle to strengthen the post-war people's economic recovery and construction of the democratic base in the northern half, fight more heroically.
    In the future, the Korean people will commemorate each year's "August 15th" with greater victories under the ever-victorious banner of proletarian internationalism, and use this to repay all the internationalist assistance given to us by close friends.

    纪念“八·一五”
    朝鲜作家  李箕永
    朝鲜人民在为祖国的和平统一、独立与战后人民经济恢复和建设而进行庄严斗争的环境里，迎接我们祖国获得解放的“八·一五”十周年纪念日。“八·一五”是由于伟大的苏联武装力量而使我们民族获得重生的日子，是朝鲜人民在解放后取得辉煌胜利的示威的节日。
    在过去的十年间，在我国人民的政治、经济、文化、社会生活的一切部门中充满着大变革，充满着在为祖国的独立、自由、幸福而进行的斗争中所获得的各种胜利。我们满怀着欢欣和自豪来回顾这一胜利的道路。
    朝鲜是世界上历史最悠久的国家之一，朝鲜人民是爱好和平和劳动的人民。可是在恶毒的日本帝国主义进行殖民统治的数十年间，在朝鲜人民的生活中没有一天是太平的日子，可怕的贫穷和痛苦支配着朝鲜人民的生活；朝鲜人民没有丝毫的自由和任何权利。
    特别是日本帝国主义为了进行侵略中国的战争，对朝鲜人民实行了更加毒辣的殖民政策。
    我们的民族文化遭到了横暴的摧残，并且被强制接受罪恶的所谓“皇民化”政策。
    日本帝国主义对于具有悠久的民族传统和灿烂的民族文化的我国人民，进行了无法形容的暴行，企图剥夺我们的语言、文字以至于姓名。
    监狱拘满了我们的爱国志士，人民的生活陷入了难以言喻的悲惨境地。可是恶毒的日本帝国主义却无法挫折我们每一个人民的民族气节和良心。朝鲜人民为了自己的解放和自由，勇敢地奋起斗争。伟大的十月革命的胜利，更加鼓舞了这一正义的斗争。
    以朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成元帅为首的抗日游击队，直到朝鲜解放的那天为止，不断地进行了英勇的武装斗争。
    通过了这种斗争，朝鲜人民同苏联以及中国人民之间结成了巩固的国际主义友谊，并且日益扩大和加强。
    迎接“八·一五”的那一天，欢迎伟大的解放者的那一天，在三千里的疆土上沸腾着欣喜和感激的欢呼声。
    那一天，太阳也显得格外光辉，好像在祝福解放了的朝鲜人民一样。白头山高昂起它的山头，迎接这新的一天。飞翔在空中的群鸟也为解放而歌唱。无知的草木看起来也好像在欢欣鼓舞。这个国家的人民，不论男女老少，满怀着解放的欢欣，熙熙攘攘地拥向广场和街头。他们欢呼解放，他们歌颂苏联军队的伟大功勋。
    我国人民把苏联军队叫做“解放者”和“援助者”，好像一家人似地爱戴他们。
    解放后，在南北朝鲜不同的形势下，朝鲜人民在我们敬爱的领袖金日成元帅和朝鲜劳动党的领导下，在共和国北半部，利用伟大的苏联军队所创造的有利条件，走上了创建强大革命民主基地的道路。由于朝鲜劳动党的正确领导，在我们的人民中涌出了像永不枯竭的泉水一样的活力。
    在解放后五年期间，我国北半部所进行的具有历史意义的民主改革和民主建设，使北半部变成为了祖国的统一和独立的强有力的革命民主基地，使北半部的人民能够过自由幸福的新生活。
    所有这一切都不合乎帝国主义者的心意，他们企图把我们已经获得解放的国家重新变成他们的殖民地，企图把我们国家当做他们侵略伟大的苏联和新生的中华人民共和国的跳板。他们终于在一九五○年六月二十五日发动了反对我们祖国和人民的侵略战争。
    在抗击美国武装侵略者及其走狗的艰苦的战斗环境中，我们人民和伟大的中国人民的优秀儿女并肩进行了战斗。中国人民在“抗美援朝、保家卫国”的崇高的无产阶级国际主义旗帜下，组织了中国人民志愿军奔赴朝鲜前线，他们在清川江畔、长津湖旁、汉江流域和上甘岭上都发挥了无比的英雄主义气概和坚忍不拔的精神，给了敌人以致命的打击，并取得了辉煌的胜利。特别是中国人民的儿女、伟大的国际主义战士黄继光、邱少云和罗盛教等烈士高贵的名子，我们是永远也不会忘记的。中国人民志愿军对朝鲜人民的这种不怕流血牺牲的援助，使得美国侵略者妄想一举吞并我们祖国的企图在英雄的朝鲜人民面前完全被粉碎了；朝鲜人民在祖国解放战争中取得了具有历史意义的胜利。
    朝鲜人民光荣地保卫了自己祖国的自由和独立，保卫了民主基地，对保卫远东和世界和平也作出了巨大的贡献。经过三年的艰苦战争，朝鲜人民遭受到了深重的灾难。停战后我们又转入了恢复建设的和平劳动。不管战争的创伤有多么严重，但是它并不能阻挡我国人民庄严前进的步伐。朝鲜人民胜利了，并正在走向新的胜利。
    在过去十年期间，朝鲜人民在为自己祖国的自由、独立和人民民主主义建设的斗争中取得了极其巨大的胜利，其中，在文学艺术方面所取得的成就也是显著的。朝鲜人民依靠伟大的苏联军队所获得的“八·一五”解放，为我国文学艺术的发展开辟了无限广阔的道路。过去，在日本帝国主义的野蛮统治下被剥夺了为自己的人民写文章的权利和进行创作活动的自由、甚至被剥夺了写自己国家文字的权利的文艺工作者，解放后不仅可以在祖国北半部自由地进行活动，而且还在人民的热烈爱戴与党和政府的经常的深切的关怀和指导下，用现实主义的创作方法写出了许多反映强有力的现实生活的优秀作品。
    同时，我们的作家队伍由于吸收了大批从解放了的我国劳动人民中间产生的文艺工作者而迅速扩大了；我们的作家队伍在“八·一五”解放后，仅有作家一百人，而今天已达二千五百人。我国文艺工作者，从以伟大苏联为首的各兄弟国家的先进的文学艺术中创造性地吸取社会主义现实主义的先进的创作方法和经验，同时，深入工农兵，学习马克思列宁主义美学，热诚地执行了我们党的正确的文艺政策。
    我们敬爱的领袖金日成元帅在一九五一年六月对作家和艺术家的谈话，已成为我国作家和艺术家的创作纲领；遵循着这一创作纲领，我国的文学艺术事业取得了不少成就。在解放后五年的和平民主建设时期，我们的文学艺术作品主要是以解放后成为土地、工厂和政权的主人的我国人民的幸福生活、在生活中表现出来的爱国主义和朝苏友谊作为主题的，同时，在这个时期，反映共和国南半部人民的悲惨的生活情况和南半部爱国人民的英勇的斗争情况，也是我们文学、艺术作品的主题之一。
    到了祖国解放战争时期，我们文学、艺术作品的主题就更加多种多样了，并产生了更多优秀的作品。在这个时期，我们文艺工作者把反映我国人民在前方和后方的英勇斗争情况、我国人民对美帝国主义武装侵略者及其走狗的高度的敌忾心、朝苏友谊和朝中友谊作为自己创造的基本主题，创作我们人民所要求的作品，因而出现了像韩雪野的小说“大同江”、赵基天的诗“朝鲜在战斗”和“在燃烧着的街道上”、洪淳哲的诗“光荣归于你们”以及剧本“煤矿工人”、影片“保卫家乡的人们”、“少年游击队”和“侦察兵”等优秀作品。
    音乐、舞蹈部门也创作了不少成功的作品，其中最优秀的作品有歌谣“在泉边”、“汽车司机之歌”和“侦察兵之歌”以及崔承喜编的“朝鲜的母亲”。
    在战后恢复建设时期，我们的文学艺术部门也创作了许多以爱国主义思想和无产阶级国际主义思想教育人民的成功的作品。
    解放后，我国文学艺术部门的这些成就，是通过同歪曲我党文艺政策和社会主义现实主义的自然主义和形式主义的倾向作无情的斗争取得的。
    我国文学艺术部门具有许多有利条件：它拥有很多有才能的有经验的作家，它经常受到党、政府和人民的关怀，它可以吸取苏联和人民中国的经验。我们人民在“八·一五”解放后的十年期间所取得这些巨大的胜利，将用金字记载在我国的历史上，永放光彩。
    朝鲜人民通过自己的亲身体验清楚地认识到：朝鲜人民与以伟大的苏联和中华人民共和国为首的兄弟国家人民之间巩固的友谊团结，是我们胜利的坚固保证。因此，在庆祝“八·一五”解放十周年之际，我们人民将更加高举起百战百胜的无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，在为祖国的和平统一和独立的斗争中，在为加强北半部民主基地的战后人民经济恢复建设的斗争中，更加英勇地奋斗。
    朝鲜人民今后将在百战百胜的无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下，以更大的胜利来纪念每年的“八·一五”，并以此答谢一切亲密的朋友给予我们的国际主义的援助。
