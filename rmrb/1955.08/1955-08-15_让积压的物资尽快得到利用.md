Title: Let Stockpiled Materials Be Utilized as Soon as Possible

To the Editor:

    After the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Materials Supply Bureau, it received a batch of stockpiled materials. According to the cost standards stipulated in the preliminary standard design plan for civil buildings determined by the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, its value can be used to build more than 210,000 square meters of buildings. These stockpiled materials are commonly used in production and capital construction, and the vast majority meet the quality standards.

    In order to put these stockpiled materials into construction as soon as possible, the Beijing Municipal Materials Supply Bureau designated special personnel to contact design, construction, and building departments. With the support of some units, many stockpiled materials have already found a way out. For example, the hydropower team of the Beijing No. 4 Construction Engineering Company has used more than 4,000 assorted radiator fins on a certain capital construction site. However, some designers, construction personnel, and construction units resolutely refuse to use stockpiled materials without considering the overall interests. In April of this year, the Beijing Municipal Planning Commission decided that the Municipal No. 1 Construction Company should use a batch of stockpiled four-column, thirty-inch radiator fins. Wang Zhixing of the hydropower team of this company said, "I don't care whether you have stockpiles or not, I don't want this batch of furnace fins anyway!" Some units, while not refusing to use stockpiled materials, unreasonably demand to lower the price significantly. For example, a four-column, thirty-inch radiator fin originally cost more than 4.6 yuan, but some units reduced the price to 3 yuan per fin. The Municipal No. 5 Construction Engineering Company wanted to use a batch of 4M-type, thirteen-piece low-pressure boilers and proposed to reduce the price by 10% based on the market price.

    Of course, in the past, the Materials Supply Bureau did not adjust the prices of certain materials that were too high in a timely manner, and individual sales personnel had a "reluctance to sell" mentality. Insufficient understanding of the "family assets" and insufficient publicity also hindered the early utilization of more stockpiled materials.

    Therefore, I suggest that in addition to the material supply departments actively doing a good job in sales, relevant leading agencies should also formulate some specific measures to encourage and urge various units to actively use stockpiled materials.

### 让积压的物资尽快得到利用

    让积压的物资尽快得到利用编辑同志：
    北京市物资供应局成立以后，接收了一批积压材料。它的价值，如果按照建筑工程部设计总局初步确定的民用建筑标准设计方案中规定的造价标准计算，可以盖楼房二十一万多平方公尺。这些积压的材料都是生产和基本建设上常用的，绝大部分质量都合乎标准。
    为了使这些积压的材料尽早用到建设上去，北京市物资供应局曾指定专人同设计、施工、建筑等部门联系。在有些单位的支持下，不少积压的材料已经找到出路。例如北京市第四建筑工程公司水电队已经把四千多片杂式暖气片用在某基本建设工地。但是有些设计、施工人员和建设单位却不从整体利益出发，就坚决拒绝采用积压的材料。今年四月，北京市计划委员会决定市第一建筑公司使用一批积压的四柱三十吋暖气片。这个公司水电队的王志兴却说：“你们积压不积压，我管不着，反正这批炉片我是不要！”还有一些单位虽然不拒绝使用积压材料，但是却无理地要求把价格压得很低。如四柱三十吋暖气片，原价四元六角多，有的单位却把价格降到三元一片。市第五建筑工程公司要使用一批四M型十三片低压锅炉，提出要按市价压低百分之十。
    当然，物资供应局过去对某些价格偏高的物资没有及时调整价格，个别推销人员有“惜售”思想，对“家底”摸不清和宣传介绍不够，也阻碍了更多地积压物资及早得到利用。
    因此，我建议：除了物资供应部门应该积极作好推销工作外，有关领导机关还应该订出一些具体办法，鼓励并督促各单位积极利用积压物资。
