Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th - News: Nosaka Sanzō, Shida Shigeo, and Konno Yojiro, members of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, who were illegally arrested by the Tokyo police authorities on the 11th, were released on the 16th and have regained their freedom. Their arrest had aroused strong protests from the Japanese public.

After arresting Nosaka Sanzō and the other two, the Tokyo police authorities transferred them to the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office for interrogation. The Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office had requested the Tokyo District Court to continue to detain Nosaka Sanzō and the other two for further interrogation. However, because this request was unfounded, the Tokyo District Court considered that there was "no reason for detention" for the three of them, and therefore rejected the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office's request on the 16th.

    日共中央委员野坂参三等三人恢复自由
    新华社十七日讯　东京消息：在十一日被东京警察当局非法逮捕的日本共产党中央常任干部会委员野坂参三、志田重男和绀野与次郎，已经在十六日被释放，恢复了自由。他们的被捕事件，曾经引起日本公众的强烈抗议。
    东京警察当局在逮捕了野坂参三等三人之后，就把他们移送东京地方检察厅进行审讯。东京地方检察厅曾经向东京地方裁判所提出继续拘留野坂参三等三人以便进一步审讯的要求。但是，由于这种要求没有根据，东京地方裁判所认为对他们三个人是“没有拘留理由”的，因此在十六日驳回了东京地方检察厅的这种要求。
