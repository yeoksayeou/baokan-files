To the Editor:

    The Beijing Telecommunications Bureau has consistently failed to prioritize grain conservation work. In late May, the Qianmen District People's Committee, to strengthen the verification of grain consumption plans, requested that the heads of all organizations and groups stationed within the district personally verify and sign their respective units' grain consumption plans. However, the grain consumption plan compiled by the Telecommunications Bureau for June was submitted only with the seals of the General Affairs Section and the Section Chief. After this plan was rejected, they only added the seal of the Office and the personal seal of Comrade Zhou Bin. Because this plan was inflated, the District People's Committee sent someone to the Telecommunications Bureau to find Comrade Zhou Bin, only to discover that he was not the head of the Office and was unaware of the planned grain consumption, the number of people eating, and the previous month's grain inventory. When the inspectors asked him why the Bureau's responsible comrades did not personally review the grain consumption plan, he said: That would take too much procedure!

    An investigation revealed that the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau canteen engaged in illegal activities in June, including falsely reporting grain consumption and underreporting grain inventory. In May, the canteen fed 660 people and actually consumed over 15,000 jin of grain. In June, the number of people eating decreased by 100, but the compiled grain consumption plan was increased to 16,400 jin. Additionally, they attempted to purchase an extra 780 jin of grain under the guise of "reserve grain." At the end of May, the canteen had a grain inventory of over 4,400 jin, but only reported over 3,800 jin. After the grain working group investigated this situation, the Telecommunications Bureau only made a simple correction to the District People's Committee at the end of June.

    The Beijing Telecommunications Bureau canteen also has serious problems with wasting grain. The District People's Committee raised this issue with them in June, urging them to pay attention. However, during a re-inspection at the end of July, it was still found that most people had many grains of rice left in their bowls, and some even left half a bowl of rice uneaten.

    We urge the leaders of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau to change this erroneous attitude and put grain conservation work on their agenda.

### 北京电信局一贯忽视节约粮食工作

    北京电信局一贯忽视节约粮食工作编辑同志：
    北京电信局一贯不重视节约粮食的工作。前门区人民委员会为加强用粮计划的核实工作，曾在五月底要求驻在区内的各机关团体的首长亲自核实和签署本单位的用粮计划。但是电信局六月份编造的用粮计划只由总务科和科长分别盖章就上报了；这份计划经驳回后，他们又只加盖了办公室的章和周斌同志的私章。由于这份计划偏高，区人民委员会就派人到电信局找到周斌同志，才发现他并不是办公室的负责人，而且对吃粮计划数、吃饭人数和上月库存粮数都不知道。检查人员问他局里的负责同志为什么不亲自审核用粮计划？他说：那得花费多少道手续呀！
    经查明，北京电信局食堂在六月份有虚报用粮和少报库存粮的违法行为。这个食堂五月份吃饭人数是六百六十人，实际吃粮一万五千多斤；六月份减少一百人吃饭，而编造的用粮计划反而增大到一万六千四百斤，另外还企图用机动粮的名义多购粮食七百八十斤；五月末，这个食堂库存粮有四千四百多斤，但是只报了三千八百多斤。粮食工作组查明这个情况后，电信局只是在六月底给区人民委员会作了一个简单的更正。
    北京电信局食堂浪费粮食的现象也很严重，区人民委员会在六月份发现后曾提请他们注意。可是在七月末再次检查时，仍然发现大部分人的饭碗中剩饭粒很多，个别人甚至剩了半碗饭。
    我们要求北京电信局的领导人员，改变这种错误态度，把节约粮食工作提到自己的议事日程上来。
