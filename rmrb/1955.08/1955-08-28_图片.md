　　The Meishan Reservoir arch dam, which has already played a role in flood control and storage during this year's flood season, has now been poured to an elevation of 123.6 meters, only a little over 17 meters away from the planned elevation. Currently, all the builders of the reservoir are continuing to advance on the basis of their victory in flood control. This is a panoramic view of the Meishan Reservoir arch dam under construction.
