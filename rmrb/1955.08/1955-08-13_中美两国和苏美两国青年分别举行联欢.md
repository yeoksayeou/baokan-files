Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 12th: The Chinese youth delegation and more than twenty American youths held a get-together on the 10th at the residence of the Chinese delegation.

    Luo Yi, head of the Chinese delegation, delivered a speech, warmly welcoming this meeting with American young friends. He said: "At a time when international tensions urgently need to be further eased, people are asking what Chinese and American youth want to do. Our answer is: We want peace, not war; we want friendship, not division; we want to live in a peaceful and friendly international environment.” Luo Yi, on behalf of Chinese youth, expressed his respect for the American youth's struggle for democracy, youth rights, and the defense of peace. When he said, "Thank you to our American young friends for deciding to accept the Chinese delegation's invitation to visit China," everyone stood up and applauded enthusiastically.

    An American youth representative said in his speech that it can be said with certainty that the American people are unwilling to shed blood for the occupation of China's territory of Taiwan. He said that when the U.S. government interfered in China's internal affairs and occupied China's territory of Taiwan, the American people protested. The American people and youth, like the people and youth of all countries, love peace and advocate peaceful negotiation to resolve international disputes. Due to the American people's efforts to demand peace, the U.S. government had no choice but to send an ambassador to Geneva to hold talks with China. The American youth representative said, "We are very grateful for your invitation, which gives us the opportunity to see the construction of new China in all aspects. Unfortunately, it is not yet possible for us to invite Chinese friends to visit the United States. But we hope that one day we can invite Chinese friends to visit the United States."

    At the get-together, Chinese and American youth had a cordial conversation, and many questions about new China raised by the American youth during the conversation were answered in detail. Chinese and American youth also exchanged souvenirs. An American young woman gave a piece of embroidery with the theme of peace and friendship, which she made herself, to the Chinese youth as a souvenir.

    At the meeting, Chinese young artists also sang American folk songs and Chinese classical music. The American representatives sang a song about the liberation of black people during the American Civil War.

    Xinhua News Agency, August 12th: According to TASS, Warsaw: On the afternoon of the 11th, the Soviet youth delegation participating in the World Youth Festival hosted the American youth delegation. The atmosphere was very warm when the youth of the two countries met. Sergei Pavlovich, Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, warmly welcomed the guests on behalf of the Soviet youth. He talked about the Soviet youth's desire for peace and friendship. Sergei Pavlovich, on behalf of the Soviet delegation, invited a group of American young men and women to visit the Soviet Union after the festival.

    The American youth representatives said in their speeches that the get-together with the Soviet youth was the most exciting thing for the American delegation during the festival. He said: We strive to hold more such gatherings in the future. I hope that thousands of American young men and women will be able to see and feel the warm feelings that are overflowing here. I believe that after visiting the Soviet Union, young men and women in our country will say that there is a friendly feeling between the Soviet and American peoples, and that this friendship should be expanded and strengthened.

    中美两国和苏美两国青年分别举行联欢
    新华社华沙十二日电　中国青年代表团和二十多位美国青年代表十日在中国代表团的住所举行了联欢会。
    中国代表团团长罗毅致词，热烈欢迎同美国青年朋友的这次会见。他说：“在国际紧张局势急待继续和缓的时候，人们都在问中国青年和美国青年想做的是什么。我们的回答是：我们要和平，不要战争；要友谊，不要分裂；我们要生活在一个和平友好的国际环境中。”罗毅代表中国青年对于美国青年争取民主、争取青年权利和保卫和平的斗争表示敬意。当他说到“感谢美国青年朋友决定接受中国代表团的邀请访问中国”时，大家一齐起立热烈鼓掌。
    美国青年代表在讲话中说，可以肯定地说，美国人民不愿为侵占中国领土台湾而流血。他说，当美国政府干涉中国内政、侵占中国领土台湾的时候，美国人民曾纷纷表示抗议。美国人民和青年同各国人民和青年一样热爱和平，主张和平协商解决国际争端。由于美国人民要求和平的努力，美国政府才不得不派出大使去日内瓦同中国举行谈判。美国青年代表说：“我们十分感谢你们的邀请，这使得我们有机会看到新中国各方面的建设。可惜我们目前还不可能请中国朋友到美国去访问。但我们希望，终有一天我们可以请中国朋友去访问美国。”
    在联欢会上，中美两国青年进行了亲切的交谈，美国青年在交谈中提出的许多关于新中国的问题都得到了详细的回答。中美青年并且交换了纪念品，一位美国女青年把她亲手制作的以和平友谊为主题的刺绣品赠给中国青年，作为纪念。
    会上，中国青年艺术家们还演唱了美国民歌和中国古典乐曲。美国代表合唱了美国南北战争时的解放黑人的歌曲。
    新华社十二日讯　据塔斯社华沙讯：十一日下午，参加世界青年联欢节的苏联青年代表团招待了美国青年代表团。两国青年会晤时气氛十分热烈。苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会书记谢列平代表苏联青年热烈欢迎来宾们。他谈到苏联青年对和平和友好的愿望。谢列平代表苏联代表团邀请一批美国男女青年在联欢节结束后访问苏联。
    美国青年代表在讲话中指出，同苏联青年联欢，对美国代表团来说是它在联欢节期间最兴奋的事。他说道：我们争取今后多多举行这样的联欢。我希望，成千成万的美国男女青年能够看到和感受到洋溢在这里的热烈感情。我相信，我国男女青年在访问苏联之后将会说，苏美两国人民之间存在着友好感情，这种友谊应当扩大和加强。
