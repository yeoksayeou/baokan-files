    Eliminating Delays in Railway Freight Transport
    Dai Zifen
    Currently, the quantity of goods transported by railway in our country accounts for 85 percent of the total national freight volume. Every day, hundreds of thousands of tons of goods are transported by railway to various places. Improving the speed of transporting these goods, ensuring they arrive at their destinations on time, is of significant importance for guaranteeing economic construction and people's livelihood needs, accelerating the turnover of materials, and saving state funds.

    However, the phenomenon of railway transport departments exceeding the delivery time limit for goods is currently very serious. According to statistics from January to June of this year, the number of freight shipments for which national railway transport departments paid fines due to exceeding the delivery time limit reached more than 5,400 batches, with fines totaling over 100,000 yuan (these figures do not include cases where the consignee did not file a claim; the actual number of overdue goods is far more than this). Due to overdue freight transport, the needs of basic construction, industrial and agricultural production, and people's lives are directly or indirectly affected. In order to meet their needs and accelerate capital turnover, some units have had to switch from railway transport to trucks or automobiles, which costs three to four times more than railway transport. For example, the Qiqihar City Department Store Wholesale Station and the Native Produce Company Purchasing and Supply Station used trucks and automobiles to transport 88 tons of essential goods for people's lives and construction materials to Nehe, Laha, Yian, Tailai and other places more than 100 kilometers away from January to April this year. Some goods are transported over very short distances, but are delayed on the railway for a long time. For example, the Sanqu Cooperative of Puqi County, Hubei Province, transported kerosene and wine from Wuchang North Station to Zhao Liqiao Station, a distance of only 147 kilometers, but it took 21 days to arrive. Such examples are not isolated. No wonder some shippers sarcastically say, "The train is not as fast as an ox cart!" There are also some international railway joint transport goods that did not exceed the time limit after long-distance transportation abroad, but exceeded the time limit during short-distance transportation in China.

    The main reason for railway transport delays is that most railway workers do not sufficiently recognize the harm of freight transport delays. They believe that as long as the goods are delivered sooner or later, they have completed their task. Some railway workers even believe that transport delays will at most result in the railway bureau paying some fines, which is nothing to worry about. Furthermore, some people believe that under the current situation where railway operation order is not yet normal, freight transport delays are inevitable, and therefore they relax their efforts.

    Secondly, the Ministry of Railways lacks a strict system for monitoring and supervising freight transport time limits; the reasons for exceeding freight delivery time limits are rarely investigated; and there is no dedicated person to monitor and supervise freight transport overdue fines. This has led to a lack of concern for freight transport delays among some railway workers.

    A large proportion of the goods transported overdue are less-than-carload (LCL) shipments. The overdue nature of these goods is mainly caused by long-term backlog at the sending station and transit station. (LCL goods are transported from the sending station to the transit station, and then forwarded from the transit station to the destination station.) The freight organization work at some stations is very chaotic, and goods are not sent promptly after being accepted for transport. For example, the Qiqihar Transport Business Office (which handles LCL sending services for the station) had a backlog of 192 batches of LCL goods from April 1st to 20th alone, three of which had been backlogged for seven days. Some goods have already exceeded the freight delivery time limit because they have been backlogged at the sending station for a long time before being sent. Some transit stations also cause backlogs because they do not transfer goods in a timely manner according to the order of arrival. For example, a batch of high-quality carbon steel that arrived at Taiyuan North Station from Shanghai on April 17th for transfer to DongsShe Station was left at Taiyuan North Station for more than a month. This situation also exists at many transit stations.

    Another reason for overdue freight transport is the departmentalism and individualism of some railway units and workers. In order to shorten the station's vehicle dwell time, some stations do not promptly allocate empty cars to the freight yard for loading, even if there are empty cars in the station; some dispatchers, in order to save time, do not stop at small stations that should be stopped at, causing some intermediate small stations to be unable to load goods, resulting in backlogs. Some stations also rush to load well-packaged, large-batch, heavy, and easy-to-load goods between shifts. They are unwilling to load some bulky machinery and some light agricultural products or scattered goods because they are difficult to load and do not easily demonstrate vehicle loading performance, thus causing these goods to be backlogged.

    Railway transport serves the entire national economy. The serious situation of freight transport delays will inevitably bring significant losses to the entire national economy, thereby affecting the development of our country's socialist construction to a certain extent. Therefore, it is hoped that the leaders of the railway transport department will pay attention to the serious consequences of freight transport delays, regularly conduct ideological education for employees responsible for railway transport, strengthen the control and supervision of freight delivery time limits, and establish and improve various necessary working systems to accelerate the speed of freight transport.

    消灭铁路运送货物中的迟缓现象
    戴自奋
    目前在我国用铁路运送的货物数量占全国货物总运送量的百分之八十五，每天都有数十万吨货物由铁路运往各地。提高这些货物的运送速度，使货物能及时运达目的地，对于保证经济建设和人民生活需要，加速物资周转，节约国家资金，有重要的意义。
    但是，目前铁路运输部门运送货物超过期限的现象十分严重。据今年一月至六月的统计，全国铁路运输部门因运输超过期限而支付罚款的货物，就有五千四百多批，支出的罚款共达十万多元（这些数字还不包括收货人未提出赔偿要求的，实际上逾期货物的数量远不止此）。由于货物运送过期，直接地或间接地影响了基本建设、工农业生产和人民生活的需要。有些单位为了满足需要，加速资金周转，不得不将应由铁路运送的货物改用大车或汽车运送。这样运价要比铁路运输高三、四倍。如齐齐哈尔市百货公司批发站和土产公司采购供应站，今年一至四月间用大车和汽车运往距离一百公里以上的讷河、拉哈、依安、泰来等地的人民生活必需品和建筑器材等就达八十八吨。有些货物运输的距离很短，但却在铁路上耽误了很长时间。例如湖北省蒲圻县三区合作社由武昌北站运煤油和酒到赵李桥站，两站相隔仅一百四十七公里，二十一天才运到。像这样的例子并不是个别的。难怪有的货主讽刺地说：“火车还赶不上牛车快！”还有些国际铁路联运的货物，在国外经过长距离的运输都没有超过期限，但在国内短距离的运输中却过期了。
    造成铁路运输迟延的主要原因是大部分铁路工作人员对货物运输迟延的危害性认识不足，他们认为迟早只要将货物运到，就算完成了任务。有些铁路工作人员甚至认为运输迟延至多由铁路局支付一些罚款，没有什么了不起。更有一部分人认为在目前铁路运行秩序还不够正常的情况下，货物运输迟延是不可避免的，因而放松了努力。
    其次是由于铁道部对货物运输期限缺乏严密的掌握和监督制度；货物运送超过期限时很少追查原因；货物运输过期罚款，也没有专人掌握和监督。这样就造成部分铁路工作人员对货物运输迟延采取了漠不关心的态度。
    过期运输的货物中，很大一部分是零担货物。这部分货物过期，主要是由于在发站和中转站长期积压所造成。（零担货物由发站运至中转站，再由中转站转发到到站。）有些车站的货运组织工作十分混乱，承运货物以后，不及时发送。例如齐齐哈尔运输营业所（办理车站的零担发送业务）仅在今年四月一日至二十日期间就积压了零担货物一百九十二批，其中有三批积压了七天。有的货物因为在发站长期积压，还没有发送就已超过了货物的运到期限。还有些中转站因不按照先后顺序及时中转而造成积压。例如四月十七日由上海到达太原北站中转到东社站的一批优质碳素钢，就在太原北站放了一个多月。这种情况在很多中转站也是有的。
    货物运到过期的另一个原因是部分铁路单位和工作人员有本位主义和个人主义的思想。有的车站为了缩短本站的车辆停留时间，站内有空车也不及时配给货场装货；有的调度人员为了赶时间，该在小站停车的也不停车，致使一些中间小站有货装不上车，造成积压。还有的车站各班间抢装包装整齐的、大批的、量重的、好装的货物，对于一些笨重的机械和一些量轻的农产品或零星货物，因为不好装和不容易表现车辆装载成绩，就不愿装，因而造成这些货物的积压。
    铁路运输是为整个国民经济生活服务的。货物运输迟延的严重情况必然会给整个国民经济带来重大的损失，从而在一定程度上影响到我国的社会主义建设事业的发展。因此，希望铁路运输部门领导人员重视货物运送迟延的严重后果，经常对负责铁路运输的员工进行思想教育，加强对货物运到期限的掌握和监督，建立并健全各项必要的工作制度，以加速货物的运送速度。
