　　The Chinese Air Force has shot down and damaged Chiang Kai-shek's group's aircraft countless times. However, recently, after our Air Force shot down and damaged two Sabre-type aircraft of the Chiang Kai-shek group that intruded into Qingyang, Anhui, the Chiang gang group came out to deny this undeniable fact, and insisted that the aircraft were reconnaissance planes sent to survey the so-called "flood."

　　The Chiang Kai-shek group probably thinks that this kind of denial and lying will benefit certain people: first, it can fabricate materials for those who are unhappy with China's great construction achievements and who constantly hope that China will have disasters and economic difficulties; second, turning the harassment of the mainland into looking at "floods," and turning Sabre-type jet aircraft into ordinary reconnaissance planes, then this kind of activity is not harassing the mainland, but a very peaceful act.

　　There is a popular saying in the United States that according to the treaty signed between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek group, they have some kind of "common intention": not to use force and not to harass the mainland. It is said that they all accept this "principle." And some people even want China to issue a statement based on this "principle," announcing that it will not liberate its own territory of Taiwan. According to this deliberately spread statement, it seems that the world is already very peaceful, and the problem only lies in China wanting to liberate Taiwan.

　　However, this statement cannot stand up to the test of facts.

　　Since people began to hear about not allowing the Chiang Kai-shek group to attack the mainland or not allowing them to use force, the Chiang Kai-shek group's harassing war activities against the Chinese mainland and coastal areas have never stopped, whether they use warships or aircraft, or what kind of aircraft. Just in terms of aircraft harassment, from May 1st to August 6th, there were 595 batches and 1,175 sorties of Chiang Kai-shek group aircraft intruding into our coastal and inland areas. Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft were not only shot down over Anhui, but they were also shot down over our Fujian, Guangdong, and other coastal areas. Their wreckage is ironclad evidence that the Chiang Kai-shek group has never stopped carrying out harassing war activities against our country.

　　Can people say that the Chiang Kai-shek group has the ability to carry out these constant war activities on its own? Isn't it a fact that a steady stream of aircraft and other military equipment are being placed in the hands of this group? Knowing full well and seeing with one's own eyes that the Chiang Kai-shek group is constantly carrying out these harassing war activities, yet continuing to supply them with weapons and equipment, what kind of logic is this? Obviously, this activity of supplying military equipment and weapons to the Chiang Kai-shek group is a typical double-dealing act that contradicts the so-called "principle" of not using force and not harassing the mainland that the United States claims. A discerning person can see this at a glance.

    蒋介石的骚扰活动和美国的“原则”
    蒋元椿
    中国空军击落击伤蒋介石集团的飞机已经是不知多少次了。但是最近，在我国空军击落击伤了窜扰安徽青阳的蒋介石集团两架佩刀式飞机之后，蒋贼集团却出来抵赖这个千真万确的事实，并且硬说飞机是来侦察所谓“水灾”的侦察机。
    蒋介石集团的意思大约以为他们这种否认和扯谎对某些人会有什么好处：一来可以替那些对中国的伟大建设成就不高兴、成天希望中国有灾荒、有经济困难的人们硬造一些材料；二来，把袭扰大陆说成是看“水灾”，把佩刀式喷气机说成是普通侦察机，那末，这种活动就不是骚扰大陆，而是很和平的行为了。
    在美国有一种流行的说法，说是根据美国同蒋介石集团订的条约，他们有了什么“共同的意图”：不使用武力，不骚扰大陆。据说他们都接受这个“原则”。并且有人还要中国根据这个“原则”发表声明，宣布不解放自己的领土台湾。按照这种有意散播的说法，好像天下已经很太平，毛病只是出在中国要解放台湾。
    但是，这种说法是禁不起同事实对证的。
    从人们开始听到所谓不许蒋介石集团攻击大陆或者不许他们使用武力等等以来，蒋介石集团对中国大陆和沿海进行的骚扰性战争活动从来就没有停止过，不管他们用的是军舰还是飞机，或者是怎样的飞机。光就飞机骚扰来说，最近从五月一日到八月六日，窜扰我国沿海和内陆的蒋介石集团飞机就有五百九十五批，一千一百七十五架次。蒋介石的飞机不仅在安徽上空被击落，它们也曾在我国福建、广东和其他沿海地区上空被击落。它们的残骸是蒋介石集团从未停止过对我国进行骚扰性战争活动的铁的证据。
    难道人们能说蒋介石集团自己有本领来进行这些经常不断的战争活动么？源源不断的飞机和其他军备被放在这个集团的手里，这难道不是事实么？明知道并且眼看到蒋介石集团经常不断地在进行着这种骚扰性的战争活动，却还要把他们进行这些活动的武器源源不断地放在他们手里，这是怎样一种道理呢？很显然，这种向蒋介石集团供应军备和武器的活动同美国所宣称的所谓不使用武力、不骚扰大陆的“原则”是典型的两面做法，明眼人一看自明。
