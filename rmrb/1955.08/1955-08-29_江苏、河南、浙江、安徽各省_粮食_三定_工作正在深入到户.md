Jiangsu, Henan, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces:
　　Grain "Three Fixes" Work is Being Thoroughly Implemented to the Household Level

　　(Our report) The work of fixing grain production, procurement, and sales down to each farmer household in rural areas of Jiangsu Province, after nearly half a month of typical experiments in various counties, according to incomplete statistics, has now been completed in more than 700 townships successively and has been preliminarily summarized. At present, the work is being carried out in the first batch of approximately 5,766 townships.

　　The "Three Fixes" to the household pilot work in various places has generally achieved good results. This is because the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council were resolutely and conscientiously implemented: estimating actual output per mu of grain land, fixing production not exceeding actual output; stipulating grain retention standards according to the current grain consumption level in various places, ensuring sufficient grain retention; and not monopolizing all surplus grain of farmers, so that farmers can still preserve a certain amount of surplus grain after the state's unified procurement. Therefore, the grain "Three Fixes" to the household work has been warmly supported by the broad masses of farmers, further arousing their enthusiasm for production and increasing production, and promoting the consolidation and development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations. In the areas where the "Three Fixes" work has been implemented to the household level, a mass production upsurge has been universally set off, filled with a warm atmosphere of increasing production everywhere. Farmers in Wuli Township, Jiangpu County, in order to prevent rice lodging, actively cut 322 mu of rice leaves, transplanted a total of 23,000 corn and sesame plants, replanted 159 mu of miscellaneous grains, drained 310 mu of waterlogged fields, and dug drainage ditches on 250 mu of land, and also requested the establishment of five agricultural production cooperatives after the autumn harvest. In Taoren, Chengbei, Dongdang, and Maozhu townships in Kunshan County, after the "Three Fixes" work was completed to the household level, the masses dispatched 462 boats to dredge mud and roll grass, an increase of 373 boats compared to before; everyone also automatically went out to find fertilizer sources, so that 7,069 mu of rice fields that were not originally planned to be topdressed were topdressed as scheduled. After the "Three Fixes" to the household in Xinjing Township, Songjiang County, 4,253 mu of fields were fertilized for the second time, accounting for 71.1 percent of the township's rice fields.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 27th - After the work of fixing grain production in rural areas of Henan Province was implemented to the household level, more than 11,000 townships have clarified the annual surplus grain households, self-sufficient households, and grain-deficient households on the basis of fixed production, and have respectively arranged the fixed procurement quantity for surplus grain households and the fixed sales quantity for grain-deficient households. Now, farmers with surplus grain in these areas are selling their surplus grain to the state according to this year's summer grain procurement targets; grain-deficient farmers have also determined the amount of grain shortage from after this year's summer harvest to before the autumn harvest (including livestock feed) according to the actual yield of this year's summer crops, and have received grain purchase certificates and grain purchase tickets.

　　When these townships implemented the fixing of grain production, procurement, and sales to the household level, they organized "Three Fixes" working committees dominated by poor peasants (including new middle peasants who have risen after land reform) to do this work specifically; and convened representative meetings including representatives of agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and individual farmers, mobilized the masses to fully discuss, and then finalized the plan through three public announcements.

　　During the work, the Communist Party of China organizations at all levels in Henan Province transferred a large number of cadres to the countryside to assist. The responsible persons of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the responsible cadres of the Henan Provincial Grain Department personally conducted investigations and guidance in the countryside.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 27th - More than 700 townships in Zhejiang Province have completed the work of fixing grain "production, procurement, and sales" to the household level. Because enough feed has been retained in the "Three Fixes", the number of pigs raised by farmers has gradually increased. The number of pigs raised by farmers in Shenzhai Township, Pan'an County, has increased from 108 to 530. Before the "Three Fixes" were implemented to the household level in Fengyan Township, Wukang County, there were only 34 pigs, and now it has increased by 105. In the three days of implementing the grain "Three Fixes" to the household level in Dongxiao Township, Jinhua County, farmers bought back 24 pigs and 9 ploughing cattle.

　　In the livestock market in Chengguan Town, Yunhe County, a total of 327 piglets were put on the market in the six market days of May, only 74 were sold, while in the three market days after the grain "Three Fixes" were implemented to the household level in July, all 87 piglets put on the market were bought by farmers. Transactions in many livestock markets are also very active.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 27th - Anhui Province is actively preparing for the implementation of grain "fixed production, procurement, and sales" to the household level.

　　All counties, special districts, and provincial-level agencies in the province have transferred cadres to conduct typical experiments of "Three Fixes" to the household level in one to three townships. Several thousand townships have established grain unified purchase and sales calculation and evaluation committees and groups composed of township and village cadres and agricultural production cooperative chairmen to assist the government in investigating and studying "Three Fixes" figures.

　　Each county will train a large number of cadres, and it is estimated that about 500,000 grassroots cadres and rural activists in the province will receive training.

　　At present, the work of fixing production for summer crops in the four special districts along the Huai River has been fully launched. In Huaibei area, the main wheat-producing area, more than 2,000 townships have completed the work of fixing production.

　　江苏、河南、浙江、安徽各省
　　粮食“三定”工作正在深入到户
    本报讯　江苏省各地农村粮食定产、定购、定销贯彻到每一农户的工作，经过各县近半个月来的典型试验，据不完整的统计，现已有七百多个乡先后结束，并已分别作了初步总结。目前第一批约有五千七百六十六个乡的工作正在展开。
    各地“三定”到户试点工作，一般都获得了良好效果。由于坚决、认真地贯彻执行了中共中央和国务院的指示：按粮田地亩估实产量，定产不超过实际产量；按各地现行的粮食消费水平规定留粮标准，留粮留够；不统购农民全部余粮，使农民将来在国家统购以后仍能保存一定数量的余粮。因此，粮食“三定”到户工作得到了广大农民的热烈拥护，进一步激发了他们的生产热情和增产积极性，促进了互助合作组织的巩固和发展。在“三定”工作贯彻到户的地区，普遍地掀起了群众性生产热潮，到处洋溢着热烈的增产气氛。江浦县五里乡农民，为了防止水稻倒伏，积极修割稻叶子三百二十二亩，移植玉米、芝麻共两万三千株，补种杂粮一百五十九亩，排除了三百一十亩受涝田的积水，还开挖了二百五十亩地的排水沟，并要求秋后建立五个农业生产合作社。昆山县陶仁、城北、东荡、毛竖四乡，在“三定”到户工作结束后，群众出动了四百六十二条船罱泥、卷草，比前增加了三百七十三条船；大家还自动出外寻找肥源，使原来不打算施加追肥的七千零六十九亩稻田如期进行追肥。松江县新泾乡“三定”到户后，便有四千二百五十三亩田施好了二次肥，占全乡水稻田的百分之七十一点一。
    新华社郑州二十七日电　河南省农村粮食定产工作贯彻到户以后，已有一万一千多个乡在定产的基础上，划清了全年余粮户、自足户和缺粮户，并分别布置了余粮户的定购数量和缺粮户的定销数量。现在，这些地区有余粮的农民正根据今年夏季粮食定购指标，把余粮卖给国家；缺粮农民也都根据今年夏季作物的实际产量，定出了今年夏收后到秋收前的缺粮数量（包括牲口饲料在内），领到购粮证和购粮票。
    这些乡在贯彻粮食定产、定购、定销到户时，组织了以贫农（包括土地改革后上升的新中农）占多数的“三定”工作委员会，具体做这个工作；并召开了包括农业生产合作社、互助组和个体农民代表参加的代表会议，动员群众充分讨论，然后三榜定案。
    在工作进行中，中共河南省各级组织抽调了大批干部下乡协助。中共河南省委的负责人和河南省粮食部门的负责干部，亲自到农村作了调查和指导。
    新华社杭州二十七日电　浙江省已有七百多个乡结束了粮食“定产、定购、定销”到户工作。由于“三定”中留下了足够的饲料，农民所养的毛猪的数量逐渐增加。磐安县深宅乡农民饲养毛猪的数量由一百零八只增加到五百三十只。武康县凤燕乡在“三定”贯彻到户以前，只有三十四只毛猪，现在增加了一百零五只。金华县东孝乡在贯彻粮食
  “三定”到户的三天中，农民们买回了二十四只毛猪和九头耕牛。
    云和县城关镇的牲畜市场，五月份的六个市日共有小猪三百二十七只上市，只成交了七十四只，而七月份粮食“三定”到户以后的三个市日，上市的八十七只小猪都被农民买去。许多牲畜市场的交易也很活跃。
    新华社合肥二十七日电　安徽省正积极进行粮食“定产、定购、定销”到户的准备工作。
    全省各县、各专区和省级机关，都已抽调干部在一个乡到三个乡进行“三定”到户的典型试验工作。已有几千个乡成立了由乡村干部、农业生产合作社社长组成的粮食统购统销计算评议委员会和小组，协助政府调查研究“三定”数字。
    各县将大批训练干部，预计全省约有五十万个基层干部和农村积极分子受到训练。
    目前沿淮四个专区的夏收作物的定产工作已全面展开。主要产麦区的淮北地区，已有两千多个乡结束定产工作。
