Jiaotong University Shipbuilding Major Graduates Complete Graduation Designs for Various Ships

The graduation designs of the fourth-year students majoring in shipbuilding at the Shipbuilding Engineering Department of Jiaotong University, which are suitable for various types of ships sailing in the ocean, along the coast, and on the Yangtze River, all passed the defense from July 18th to 30th.

Student Lu Xinsen's design, the "Ocean-going Oil Tanker," is one of the special ships that China has never designed or manufactured before. In this design, Lu Xinsen appropriately arranged the power unit, bridge, oil tanks, and oil pipeline system. This oil tanker can navigate the ocean between Vladivostok in the Soviet Union and Shanghai, Qingdao, Tanggu, and Dalian in China. The maximum range is 12,000 nautical miles, and the displacement reaches more than 16,900 metric tons. The defense committee believes that Lu Xinsen has demonstrated the ability to work independently in his design, and can use the scientific theoretical knowledge he has learned to carefully consider practical problems, and decided to give him a "Excellent" grade.

Students who also received "Excellent" and "Good" grades in the graduation design defense included Dai Jingwu, Wang Zhimin, and Wan Shanglu and forty others, accounting for more than 70% of the class. They designed a 10,000-ton cargo ship suitable for year-round navigation in the Pacific, a regular passenger-cargo ship responsible for coastal and Yangtze River passenger and cargo transportation, and a shallow-water tugboat for push-tow operations in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The designs fully complied with the principles of practicality, economy, comfort, and aesthetics, and were well received by the shipbuilding experts and teachers who served as members of the graduation design defense committee.

This year, Jiaotong University students conducted more than 30 types of graduation designs or graduation projects for the first time. More than 700 graduating students from departments such as Mechanical Manufacturing, Electrical Equipment Manufacturing, and Electrical Engineering participated in the design.

    交通大学船舶制造专业毕业生作了各种船舶的结业设计
    交通大学造船工程系船舶制造专业四年级学生所作的适合于远洋、沿海、长江航行的各种类型船舶的结业设计，在七月十八日到三十日全部通过了答辩。
    学生陆鑫森设计的“远洋油轮”是我国历史上从来没有设计和制造过的特种船舶之一。陆鑫森在这个设计中比较适当地安排了动力装置、驾驶台、油舱和油管系统。这艘油轮可在苏联海参崴和我国上海、青岛、塘沽、大连之间作海洋航行。最大航程为一万二千浬，排水量达一万六千九百多公吨。答辩委员会认为：陆鑫森在设计中已经表现出具备独立工作的能力，能够运用自己所学的科学理论知识，周密地考虑实际问题，决定给予“优”等评分。
    在结业设计答辩中，同时取得“优”、“良”评分的学生还有戴经武、王之珉、万尚鲁等四十三人，占全班学生的百分之七十以上。他们设计了适合在太平洋四季通航的一万公吨货船，担负沿海和长江客货运送的定期客货船和长江中上游顶推、拖曳两用的浅水拖船等。设计完全符合实用、经济、舒适、美观的原则，得到担任结业设计答辩委员会委员的我国造船专家和教师的好评。
    交通大学学生今年第一次进行三十多种类型的毕业设计或结业设计。参加设计的有机械制造、电工器材制造、电力工程等系应届毕业生七百多人。
