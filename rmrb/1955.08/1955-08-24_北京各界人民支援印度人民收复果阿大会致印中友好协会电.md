Telegram from the People of All Circles in Beijing Supporting the Indian People's Recovery of Goa Rally to Mr. Sundarlal, Chairman of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association:

　　On August 23rd, a rally was held in Beijing by people from all circles, initiated by the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, to support the Indian people's struggle to recover Goa. The conference paid high tribute to the Indian people who are bravely fighting to defend their national territorial sovereignty; expressed deep condolences and sympathy to the victimized Indian patriots and their families, and protested with great indignation against the atrocities of the Portuguese colonialists.

　　The conference expressed its firm belief that the Indian people's struggle to demand the recovery of Goa is just. It has the sympathy and support of the Chinese people and the people of Asia and the world who love peace, independence, and freedom. It will surely win!
