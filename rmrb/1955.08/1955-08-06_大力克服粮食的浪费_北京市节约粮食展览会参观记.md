    Vigorously Overcome the Waste of Grain
    ——A Visit to the Beijing Grain Conservation Exhibition
    By Our Correspondent Jin Feng
    The Beijing Grain Conservation Exhibition sharply criticized and exposed the phenomenon of grain waste in many government offices, organizations, enterprises, schools, and among citizens.
    In public canteens, the waste of grain is shocking. On the tables and on the ground, there are discarded large grains of white rice, baozi skins, steamed bread crusts, and pancake corners. The Beijing Grain Bureau canteen picked up six catties of leftover rice after one meal. The Third Dining Group of Tsinghua University swept up nine catties of leftover rice from the tables and the floor after one meal. Extrapolating from this, more than six thousand catties of grain would be wasted in a year.
    The canteen of the Dahongmen Sewage Disposal Plant wastes a pot of porridge every day, wasting thirteen hundred catties of sorghum per month. The Fourth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways found 722 catties of pot crusts in storage this February, some of which were completely moldy.
    The irresponsibility and serious dereliction of duty of some grain storage, transportation, and processing personnel have caused great losses to grain. Last year, the Beijing Grain Bureau's warehouses lost three million catties of grain due to poor storage, which became moldy.
    Train transport accidents resulted in varying degrees of damage to more than 570,000 catties of grain.
    Due to poor management, the state-owned Beijing Winery lost more than 3.1 million catties of grain last year.
    The waste of grain in the cooked food industry is also alarming. According to a key investigation of 105 cooked food businesses in the Qianmen District alone, more than 13,200 catties are wasted annually. Extrapolating from this, the entire cooked food industry in Beijing wastes more than 837,000 catties of grain each year.
    Street residents also have serious waste. A photograph shows cooked food, already hard and dry, placed on the windowsill of a resident's home.
    Many facts have proved that an important reason for the waste of grain in Beijing is the lax enforcement and management of the planned grain supply system. This has created opportunities for unscrupulous merchants and dealers to purchase and transport state grain illegally.
    The exhibition included a guest registration book from an inn. The owner of Duanjiadian Inn in Haidian District used this registration book to buy more than 1,000 catties of grain in March for the people staying at the inn. In addition, there was a grain purchase certificate belonging to Song Xiuzhen, the owner of a hotel in Baiwanzhuang Township. This family of five purchased 2,024 catties of grain with this grain purchase certificate in February alone.
    Zhang Mingde, an unscrupulous merchant from the Second District of Pinggu County, went to Beijing to borrow grain purchase certificates from relatives and friends everywhere, and illegally purchased more than 500 catties of grain in three batches, transported it back to his hometown, and sold it at high prices.
    Wei Litang and Yang Xin, managers of two feed stores in Beijing, resold more than 40,000 catties of grain and 70,000 catties of soybean cakes and bran by adulterating feed and other methods.
    Some collective canteens lack management systems, and the canteens have become small restaurants where anyone can enter and exit at will. A cartoon sharply reveals the chaotic situation of diners in the workers' canteen of the Zhoukoudian Lime Factory. The Hongxing Township government in Nanyuan District frequently issued IOU slips at will to purchase grain from grain supply and marketing cooperatives.
    Wasting grain is a crime, a shameful act. The broad masses of the people in Beijing cannot tolerate the continuation of this phenomenon and unanimously demand a change in this situation. The exhibition displayed many letters from the people, sharply criticizing the phenomenon of grain waste and also exposing the crimes of unscrupulous merchants in illegally trafficking grain.
    In March of this year, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee discussed the work of strengthening grain management in accordance with the order of the State Council. In April, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee approved the regulations of the Municipal Grain Bureau on strengthening the planned supply of grain. In May, a system of monthly preparation of grain demand plans was implemented in collective mess units such as government offices, factories, and mines. In June, a method of ordering grain plans per household was universally implemented among residents.
    The government offices, schools, factories, and residents of Beijing have been mobilized. Many responsible persons of government offices, organizations, schools, factories, and enterprises have personally participated in the work of verifying the population and verifying the amount of grain supply. Pictures introduce the situation of Sun Yunlai, deputy director of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, reviewing the actual grain consumption of his unit in June and the grain demand plan for July, and also introduce the situation of the party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League leaders of the Engineering Company of the Ministry of Light Industry holding a meeting to review the grain consumption plan for June. Due to Vice President Nie Zhen personally reviewing the grain consumption plan, Renmin University of China implemented verification and quantitative measures throughout the school, saving 13,174 catties of grain in July compared to June. Many staff members of state organs have helped families accurately calculate the amount of grain consumption. Residents have also been meticulous in their calculations and have drawn up family grain consumption plans. Since Beijing began rectifying the work of unified grain purchase and sale, the number of grain consumption has significantly decreased. According to statistics, it decreased by 11.53 million catties in May compared to April, and by another 12.86 million catties in June compared to May.
    However, there are still some government offices, organizations, and residents who have the shameful behavior of being generous in budgeting but stingy in actual use, and falsely reporting and fraudulently claiming.
    The materials at the exhibition indicated: The No. 2 Engineering Zone 5506 construction site of the Beijing Fifth Construction Company reported 300 people in June, but there were actually only 184 people.
    Some unit leaders irresponsibly approved the grain consumption plan of their unit casually. The Temple of Heaven Management Office under the Beijing Municipal Gardening Bureau planned to have an average of ten people joining the group meal every day in May, requesting a supply of 2,200 catties of grain, with each person eating more than seven catties of grain a day on average. This was impossible, but the Gardening Bureau office actually approved this plan!
    The above-mentioned shameful acts have been criticized by public opinion and corrected by the competent authorities.
    Now, Beijing has begun a large-scale grain conservation movement.
    Many canteens have improved their operating methods. Leftover rice is processed into fried rice, and the steamed bread crusts on the drawer cloth are saved for kneading dough. Rice is washed using a fine sieve to catch the rice grains. Hospitals have implemented a "three diligences" (diligent questioning, diligent adding, diligent taking) system for delivering meals. Grain processing, storage, and supply departments have all formulated grain conservation plans, aiming to save 11.3 million catties of grain from April to December of this year. Beijing's textile and dyeing industry uses sodium silicate instead of flour paste, which can save more than one million catties of grain a year. The soy sauce brewing industry uses bran instead of flour and sorghum, which can save more than two million catties of grain a year.
    The Eastern Suburb Warehouse of the Beijing Grain Bureau established a Youth Grain Protection Team in May, eliminating insects, sparrows, accidents, and grain spoilage in ten warehouses. In the past few months, they have caught more than 300 rats and killed more than 530 sparrows. They have picked out about 5,900 catties of good grain from the soil grain and swept out more than 260 catties of grain from the surrounding mats of the grain piles.
    Grain conservation has gradually become a habit for everyone in Beijing, and an atmosphere of opposing grain waste and strictly conserving grain has emerged everywhere. With the further deepening of the movement, with the further improvement of the masses' awareness, and through continuous political mobilization and meticulous organizational work, Beijing will achieve greater results in grain conservation.

    大力克服粮食的浪费
    ——北京市节约粮食展览会参观记
    本报记者　金凤
    北京市节约粮食展览会，对许多机关、团体、企业、学校以及市民中浪费粮食的现象进行了尖锐的批评和揭发。
    在公共食堂里，粮食的浪费是触目惊心的。在桌子上和地上，都有丢弃的大粒的白米饭、包子皮、馒头皮和烙饼角。北京市粮食局食堂一顿饭捡起了剩饭六斤。清华大学第三膳团一顿饭后，从饭桌上和地上扫起剩饭九斤，以此推算，一年要浪费粮食六千多斤。
    大红门粪污处置场的食堂每天剩一锅粥，一个月要浪费高粱米一千三百斤。铁道部第四工程局今年二月份查出存锅粑七百二十二斤，其中有一部分已经完全霉坏。
    一部分粮食保管、运输、加工人员的不负责任和严重失职，给粮食造成很大的损失。北京市粮食局所属仓库去年一年因保管不好而霉变的粮食有三百万斤。
    火车运输事故，使五十七万多斤粮食有不同程度的损伤。
    国营北京酿酒厂因为经营管理不好，去年一年损失粮食三百十万多斤。
    熟食业的粮食浪费也是惊人的。仅据前门区一百零五户熟食业的重点调查，一年要浪费一万三千二百多斤，以此推算，北京全市熟食业每年要浪费粮食八十三万七千多斤。
    街道居民同样有严重的浪费。一幅照片拍下了搁在一户居民窗台上的已经变得干硬的熟食。
    许多事实证明了，北京市浪费粮食的重要原因，是由于粮食计划供应制度执行不严，管理松懈，这给奸商奸贩造成了套购、盗运国家粮食的机会。
    展览会上有一本旅栈旅客登记簿。海淀区段家店掌柜利用这个登记簿在三月份买了一千多斤粮食给住店的人。另外有一本购粮证是百万庄乡一个客店店主松秀珍的，这个五口之家仅在今年二月就用这购粮证购进粮食二千零二十四斤。
    平谷县二区的奸商张明德到北京四处向亲戚朋友借购粮证，分三次套购粮食五百多斤，倒运回乡，高价出卖。
    北京的两家饲料店经理魏礼堂和杨信用饲料掺假等办法倒卖粮食四万多斤，豆饼、麸皮等七万斤。
    有些集体食堂缺乏管理制度，食堂变成了小饭馆，任何人都可以随便出入。一幅漫画尖锐地揭发了周口店石灰厂的工人食堂用饭人的杂乱情形。南苑区红星乡政府经常随意开出白条子去粮食供销处购买粮食。
    浪费粮食是罪恶，是可耻的行为，北京市广大人民不能容忍这种现象继续下去，一致要求改变这种状况。展览会上陈列了许多人民的来信，尖锐地批评了粮食浪费的现象，也检举了奸商们的盗贩粮食罪行。
    今年三月，北京市人民委员会根据国务院命令讨论了加强粮食管理的工作。四月，北京市人民委员会批准了市粮食局关于加强粮食计划供应的规定。五月，在机关、厂矿等集体伙食单位实行了按月编造需粮计划的制度。六月在居民中普遍实行了按户订吃粮计划的办法。
    北京市的机关、学校、工厂、居民都动员起来了。许多机关、团体、学校、厂矿、企业单位的负责人，都亲自参加查实人口、核实粮食供应量的工作。图片介绍了长辛店机车车辆修理工厂副厂长孙运来审查本单位六月份实际用粮和七月份需粮计划的情形，也介绍了轻工业部工程公司党、政、工、团负责人开会审查六月份用粮计划的情形。中国人民大学由于副校长聂真亲自审查用粮计划，全校贯彻了核实定量措施，七月份比六月份节省粮食一万三千一百七十四斤。许多国家机关工作人员都帮助家庭准确计算用粮数量。居民们也都精打细算，订好家庭用粮计划。北京市进行整顿粮食统销工作以来，用粮数字有了显著下降，据统计，五月份比四月份下降一千一百五十三万斤，六月份又比五月份下降一千二百八十六万斤。
    但是也还有一些机关、团体和居民有宽打窄用、虚报冒领的可耻行为。
    展览会上的材料指明：北京市第五建筑公司第二工区五五○六工地六月份报了三百人，实际只有一百八十四人。
    有些单位负责人不负责任地随便批准本单位用粮计划。北京市园林局所属天坛管理处五月份计划每天平均有十个人流动入伙，要求供应粮食二千二百斤，每个人平均一天要吃到七斤多粮食。这是不可能的，但是园林局办公室竟然批准了这计划！
    以上这些可耻的行为，受到了群众舆论的指责，由主管机关作了纠正。
    现在，北京市开始了大规模的粮食节约运动。
    许多食堂改进了操作法。剩下的米饭加工炒饭，屉布上的馒头皮剩下和面，淘米用细筛子接住。医院实行送饭三勤（勤问、勤添、勤取）制度。粮食加工、保管、供应部门都制定了节约粮食计划，从今年四月到十二月要节约粮食一千一百三十万斤。北京市织染业用矽酸钠代替面粉浆，一年可以节约粮食一百多万斤。酱油酿造业用麸皮代替面粉、高粱，一年要节约二百多万斤粮食。
    北京市粮食局所属东郊仓库，五月份成立了青年护粮队，在十幢仓库里消灭了虫、雀、事故和粮食霉坏现象。几个月来已捕鼠三百多只，打死雀鸟五百三十多只。他们从土粮中拣出了好粮五千九百斤左右，又从粮食囤子的围席里打扫出粮食二百六十多斤。
    节约粮食在北京市已逐渐成为每一个人的习惯，到处都出现了反对浪费粮食，严格节约粮食的气氛。随着运动的进一步深入，随着群众觉悟的进一步提高，并经过不断的政治动员和细密的组织工作，北京市对粮食的节约将会得到更大的成绩。
