To encourage the patriotism and enthusiasm of Overseas Chinese and their active participation in the construction of the motherland, and to facilitate Overseas Chinese investment in agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry enterprises, these regulations are formulated.

Article 2: Overseas Chinese may apply to people's committees at the county (city) level or above for the use of state-owned barren mountains and wasteland for agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production, using the following management methods:

	(1) Private investment – sole proprietorship, joint venture, or joint-stock company;
	(2) Public-private partnership – if Overseas Chinese are willing to engage in a public-private partnership with the state, and the state deems it necessary, a public-private partnership may be implemented;
	(3) Individual operation;
	(4) Cooperative operation.

Article 3: Overseas Chinese who use state-owned barren mountains and wasteland for agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production through individual operation or cooperative operation shall not pay usage fees, the same as other farmers who use state-owned land.

Article 4: The land use period for Overseas Chinese who use state-owned barren mountains and wasteland for agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry enterprises through private investment or public-private partnership shall generally be set at twenty to fifty years. The local people's committee shall specify this period when approving the use, based on the length of time required for the planned crops to grow, the time to harvest and profit, and the scale of investment. If the cultivation time is long, the harvest and profit are slow, and the scale of investment is large, the usage period should be longer. During the period of use, the state guarantees the operator's land use rights and the profits from legitimate operations.

Article 5: Overseas Chinese who use state-owned barren mountains and wasteland for agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry enterprises through private investment or public-private partnership shall pay a certain usage fee to the state. The amount of the usage fee and the method of payment shall be jointly determined by the local people's committee and the applicant when approving the use, based on the condition of the land and the project being operated. The payment of usage fees may be exempted or postponed before the operated enterprise generates profits.

Article 6: Applications to people's committees at the county (city) level or above for the use of state-owned barren mountains and wasteland shall include the following information on the application form:

	(1) Name, age, native place, address of the applicant (or group representative), and the name of the group represented;
	(2) Name, location, and area (with map) of the barren mountain or wasteland applied for;
	(3) Operating plan for the applied-for barren mountain or wasteland (operating plans are not required for small land plots used for individual production).

Article 7: If the people's committee at the county (city) level or above, after reviewing the application submitted by the applicant, considers it approvable, it shall issue a usage certificate. After receiving the usage certificate, the applicant obtains the right to use the barren mountain or wasteland listed on the usage certificate.

Article 8: State-owned barren mountains and wasteland must be operated in accordance with the plan registered at the time of application. Any changes to the operating plan must be reported to the original approving authority for approval in advance. If the operation has not commenced within two years after obtaining the right to use state-owned barren mountains and wasteland, the original approving authority may cancel the right to use and revoke the usage certificate.

Article 9: Agriculture, forestry, or animal husbandry operated using state-owned barren mountains and wasteland shall pay agricultural tax, forestry tax, or animal husbandry tax in accordance with regulations. Tax reductions or exemptions shall be granted in accordance with regulations before perennial crops such as trees yield profits or in cases of disaster or poor harvest.

Article 10: The operation of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry using state-owned barren mountains and wasteland must comply with national policies and laws, and be subject to the management of the competent authorities, which shall also provide necessary technical guidance.

Article 11: Provinces with a large amount of Overseas Chinese investment may formulate implementation measures based on these regulations and with reference to local conditions, and report them to the State Council for the record.

Article 12: These regulations apply to farms, forest farms, or pastures currently operated by Overseas Chinese.
