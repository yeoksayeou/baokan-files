　　Beware of the Growth of Bureaucratic Formalism
　　General Office of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Following the instructions of the Provincial Committee, we selected several units at the provincial, special district, and county levels in ten regions in late May to mid-June to conduct an inspection of the phenomenon of bureaucratic formalism. From this inspection, it can be seen that after the anti-"Five Excesses" campaign in 1953, the phenomenon of bureaucratic formalism in various levels of government agencies once decreased. However, since the second half of 1954, bureaucratic formalism has been growing again, and in some units, it has developed to a very serious extent.
    Bureaucratic formalism mainly manifests itself in the following aspects:
    There are too many official documents. The higher levels cannot manage to draft, print, and distribute them, and the lower levels cannot finish reading and handling them, causing a serious waste of manpower and resources. According to statistics from the Provincial Insurance Company for the first quarter of this year, an average of more than six documents were issued per day. The Baoding Prefectural Committee and its various departments and commissions issued a total of 707 kinds of documents from January to mid-May this year, an average of five documents per day. The number of documents issued by county-level agencies is also alarming. According to statistics from the Huanghua County Committee of the Communist Youth League and two other units, a total of 4,316 documents were issued from January to April this year. Too many official documents make it impossible for district and township workers to cope, so they have to take a perfunctory approach. Some district workers said: "Look at the big things, handle the urgent things, and generally ignore the rest."
    There are also many types of reports. According to the Baoding Special District Tax Bureau, the provincial tax bureau requires a large number of reports from them. In addition to regular monthly, quarterly, and annual reports, and special tax policy reports, there are also semi-annual reports and other temporary reports, etc. Special tax policy reports alone are required seventeen times a quarter, and with all kinds of reports added together, a report has to be written on average every two days. The four internal affairs staff of the bureau are busy writing reports and materials every day, and are still overwhelmed by the demand for materials. Twenty-two units in Huanghua County have stipulated written and telephone reporting systems to the districts, and a district committee secretary in Gu'an County once received 24 telephone calls in one day, all from the county urging for figures and information. There are also some bizarre report contents, such as the "Organization Table for Consolidating Agricultural Cooperatives" issued by the Fourth District of Nanpi, which has 60 items, including the number of cooperative directors and committee members who are virtuous and talented, talented but not virtuous, virtuous but not talented, and neither talented nor virtuous. Lower-level cadres cannot fill out such a survey and statistics. The large number of reports printed and distributed below the county level is directly related to the demands of the province and special districts. It has become a common phenomenon to ask for situation reports via long-distance telephone calls, and this is most serious at the provincial, special district, and county levels. The Baoding Special District-level agencies spent almost their entire annual long-distance telephone budget in the first quarter. Some staff members in the Fourth District of Nanpi County wrote a satirical poem saying: "The special district asks for it by phone, the county makes the outlines, the district makes the forms, and the township makes up the reports." Some townships in Tong County, in order to cope with the superiors who come to urge for figures, simply post some basic township figures on the wall for anyone who comes to copy. Many agencies demand a lot of reports from lower levels but do not use them. For example, the Industry and Commerce Section of the Baoding Special Administrative Office demanded figures from its subordinate units, but many of them were not even looked at and were simply filed away.
    The procedures for handling official documents are also very complicated. In the Provincial Department of Finance, it generally takes five or six steps for a general document to be drafted and issued. If the document needs to be signed and issued by the director of the department, it takes no less than a dozen steps. The process is: the team member drafts, the team leader and others review it, then it is sent to the section secretary, section chief, department secretary, and director of the secretariat to the department director, then it is printed and issued. The second quarter work plan of the Baoding People's Bank Central Branch, drafted on April 4, was sent to the special administrative office for review after being reviewed by the section chief and director of the bank for a week. It was reviewed by the special administrative office, the secretary of the office, the director of the financial committee, and the commissioner, etc., for a total of one month, and was not approved until May 19. By the time this document was printed and distributed, there was only a little over a month left in the second quarter. For example, the Provincial People's Committee announced the "Regulations on Rewarding the Planting of Sweet Potatoes and Potatoes in Hebei Province in 1955," which was not issued to the counties until May 25, by which time the spring planting season was almost over.
    Due to the lack of communication between departments, the contents of official documents are repeated or contradictory to each other, leaving the lower levels at a loss as to what to do. For example, when new currency was issued, the Provincial Finance Committee issued a comprehensive instruction, but a day or two later, the Provincial Department of Finance, the Department of Commerce, and the Provincial Bank each issued instructions with the same content as the instruction of the Finance Committee. Another example is the issue of subsidies for the children of officers after the officer's salary system was changed to a wage system. The Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, the Department of Education, the Personnel Bureau, the Department of Finance, and the military region and other five departments issued six notices and instructions one after another, with inconsistent opinions, making it impossible for the lower levels to implement them. Even the documents issued by the same department are repetitive. For example, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry issued eight related documents on livestock protection and solving the problem of fodder in April and May, five of which mostly repeated the same content.
    Too many official documents are drafted crudely and irresponsibly. For example, the "Instruction on Solving the Problem of Livestock and Pig Feed" issued by the Baoding Special Administrative Office Finance Committee, because it did not analyze whether the grain depots of the grassroots cooperatives in the special district had grain reserves, blindly copying and forwarding the original text of the provincial instruction "The district grain depot shall receive purchase vouchers and purchase from the grassroots cooperative grain depots," as a result, after the instruction was issued, the grassroots cooperatives had no grain, and the lower levels pushed each other, affecting the supply; in order to solve this problem, a supplementary instruction was issued, but the supplementary instruction made a big mistake, and the instruction was issued again, but the mistake was still made, one mistake after another. Another example is the issue of engraving seals by the General Office of the Provincial People's Committee. The first notice had an error, the second correction notice had another error, so a correction of the correction notice was issued. As for mistakes in writing the issuing agency, writing the wrong year and month, missing words and sentences, and punctuation errors, they are common phenomena.
    The fundamental cause of bureaucratic formalism is the serious bureaucracy of the leading agencies. Some leading staff members are satisfied with using official documents to lead the work and are unwilling to go deep into the lower levels. Some are due to the lack of strict control from the leadership, so that departments, sections, and even individuals can ask the lower levels for materials. However, they do not promptly respond to the questions asked by the lower levels, or because they do not understand the situation at the lower levels, the instructions issued do not meet the actual needs, which only increases the trouble for the lower levels.
    To overcome bureaucratic formalism, first of all, it is necessary to strictly control the issuance of documents, and truly issue only the documents that must be issued, and not issue those that can be issued or not. And it must be strictly regulated. District and township below the county level are not allowed to make their own forms, and all levels above the county level (including the county) are not allowed to formulate regular forms and reports. If the party and mass organizations want to organize a survey form, it must be approved by the local statistics department, approved by the person in charge of the department, and reported to the Provincial Bureau of Statistics for record, otherwise it will be regarded as illegal. There must be restrictions on the reports that various departments require from below. Unreasonable reporting systems stipulated in the past should be appropriately reduced, and temporary reports should not be requested casually.
    Secondly, it is necessary to change the leadership style and vigorously promote the leading cadres of various levels and departments to go deep into the grassroots to inspect and guide the work. When the leading cadres go down, they will find more problems and put forward practical solutions to the problems in a timely manner, which can greatly reduce official documents and reports.

### 警惕文牍主义现象的滋长

　　警惕文牍主义现象的滋长
　　中共河北省委办公厅
    我们根据省委指示，曾于五月下旬到六月中旬，在省、专区、县三级中选择了十个地区的若干单位分别检查了一次文牍主义的现象。从这次检查中可以看出，经过一九五三年反“五多”之后，各级机关中的文牍主义现象曾一度减少。但自一九五四年下半年以来，文牍主义现象又在滋长，有的单位已发展到很严重的地步。
    文牍主义主要表现在下列几方面：
    公文繁多，上边拟办印发不过来，下边阅办不完，造成严重的人力、物力的浪费。省保险公司今年第一季度统计，平均每天发文六件以上。保定地委及其各部委，今年一至五月中旬统计，共下发文件七百零七种，平均每天发出五件。保定专署粮食管理局一个会计科一至四月份就向下行文二百多件。县级机关发文数量也很惊人。黄骅县团委会等三个单位统计，今年一至四月份，共发文四千三百一十六件。公文过多，就使区乡工作人员忙不过来，只好采取敷衍了事的态度。有些区工作人员就说：“大事看看，紧事办办，一般不管。”
    报表的种类也多。据保定专区税务局反映，省税务局向他们所要的报告非常多，除定期的月报、季报、年报、税政专题报告外，还有半年报告和其他临时报告等等，只税政专题报告一季就要了十七次，各种报告加在一起，平均每两天要写一次报告。该局四个内勤工作人员，每天忙于写报告写材料，仍是材料追人。黄骅县有二十二个单位对区都规定了文字和电话的汇报制度，固安县一个区委书记一天时间曾接过二十四次电话，都是县里催要数字情况的。还有些表报的内容离奇，如南皮四区制发的整顿农业合作社组织表，有六十个项目，内有社长及社务委员有德有才，有才无德，有德无才，无才无德的各多少，这样的调查统计，下面干部无法填写。县以下印发的表报多，同省、专两级催要情况有直接关系。随便从长途电话里要情况报告，已成为普遍现象，省、专、县三级最为严重。保定专区一级各机关全年的长途电话费，第一季度即花得差不多了。南皮县四区有的工作人员做了一首讽刺诗说：“专
  （专区）把电话要，县把提纲造，区里制成表，乡里瞎胡报”。通县有的乡为应付上级来人坐催数字，便把乡若干基本数字贴在墙上，谁来要就让谁抄。许多机关向下级催要来表报很多并未利用。如保定专署工商科向所属单位催来数字情况后，有不少是根本不看的，随来随入卷。
    办理公文的手续也很复杂。省财政厅一般文件从拟办到发出一般要经过五、六道手续，如需厅长签字发出的文件则不下十几道手续，其过程是：组员拟稿，组长等核阅后送处秘书、处长、厅秘书、秘书主任到厅长，再打印、发出。保定人民银行中心支行第二季度工作计划，自四月四日拟成初稿经本行科长、行长轮审一星期后，送至专署审核，经专署办公室、秘书主任、财委主任、专员等人审阅，共达一个月之久，至五月十九日才审妥，此件印发下去后，第二季只剩一个多月了。如省人民委员会公布“河北省一九五五年奖励种植甘薯、马铃薯的规定”，五月二十五日才下达到县，而此时春耕播种已接近结束。
    由于部门之间互不通气，公文内容彼此重复或相互矛盾，使下边无所适从。如发行新币时，省财委曾发了全面性的指示，但过一两天后，省财政厅、商业厅、省银行又各自发下和财委的指示内容相同的指示。又如军官的待遇改为薪金制后子女助学金的问题，省民政厅、教育厅、人事局、财政厅以及军区等五个部门先后发了六个通知、指示，意见不一致，下边无法执行。甚至本部门所发的文件也有重复的，如省农林厅关于保畜和解决饲草问题，四、五两月份先后发了八个有关文件，其中有五个内容多是重复的。
    拟办公文太多就粗制滥造，不负责任。如保定专署财委“关于解决牲畜、猪饲料的指示”，由于不分析本专区基层社粮点是否有存粮，盲目照转省的指示原文“由区粮库领购买凭单，到基层社粮点购买”，结果指示发下去后，基层社无粮，下边互推，影响了供应；为了解决这一问题，又发补充指示，但补充指示又出了大错，再次发指示，结果仍出了差错，一错再错。又如省人民委员会办公厅关于刻制印章问题，第一次通知发生了错误，第二次更正通知又发生了错误，于是又发了更正的更正通知。至于写错发文机关，写错年月、漏掉字句，标点差错等缺点，则是普遍性的现象。
    产生文牍主义的根本原因，是由于领导机关有严重的官僚主义。某些领导工作人员满足于用公文来领导工作，不肯深入下层，有的是由于领导上缺乏严格的控制，以致处、科甚至个人都可以向下级要材料。而对下级请示的问题又不及时作复，或因不了解下情，所发的指示不合乎实际需要，徒然增加下面的麻烦。
    要克服文牍主义，首先要严格控制发文工作，真正做到必须发的文件才发，可发可不发的不发。而且要严格规定。县以下的区乡不准擅自制发表格，县以上（包括县）各级不准制定定期性表报，如党群系统要组织调查表，必须经过当地统计部门同意，经部门负责人批准，报省统计局备案，否则即视为非法。各部门向下要报告必须有限制，凡过去规定的不合理的报告制度要适当减少，临时的报告不能随便滥要。
    其次要转变领导作风，大力提倡各级各部门领导人员深入到基层去检查和指导工作，领导人员到下面去，会发现更多的问题，并及时提出切合实际的解决问题的办法，这就可以大大减少公文报告。
