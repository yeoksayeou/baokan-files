Mobilize the Masses to Vigorously Store Livestock Fodder
Peng Ganqing

In many areas, due to a lack of fodder, a large number of livestock become weak and die every winter and spring. During these two seasons, the number of livestock sold and slaughtered in rural areas is also the highest. Obviously, this situation is very unfavorable to the development of agriculture and animal husbandry. We must learn from this lesson and do everything possible to overcome the contradiction between the development of animal husbandry and the supply of fodder. To this end, all localities must seize the current season of lush wild grass growth and the upcoming autumn harvest season, and organize the broad masses to do a good job in fodder harvesting and storage.

In the past, many areas did not pay enough attention to the work of storing fodder. Some leading bodies often considered crop stalks as by-products, seemingly unimportant, or believed that the masses would prepare fodder themselves. As a result, they adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards fodder storage, making it difficult to solve the problem of fodder shortage. On the part of the masses, there is a general tendency to use grass indiscriminately, with little careful calculation and conservation. Therefore, every winter and spring, all localities feel the lack of fodder, making it difficult to feed livestock. In some areas, there have even been abnormal phenomena such as tearing down house thatch to feed livestock, feeding wheat seedlings, and grass being more expensive than grain and firewood. Many farmers sell and slaughter livestock in large numbers, resulting in significant losses of animal power in rural areas.

There is a possibility of improving the fodder supply situation. First, the vigorous development of rural mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and the unified use of labor and land, have provided favorable conditions for the development of fodder storage and planting. Second, although the planting area of high-yield crops (such as sweet potatoes and corn) has been expanded in some areas, the utilization rate of vines and stalks is still very low, and mountain grass has not been well utilized. There is also a large amount of fodder waste in some areas. Changing this situation will help solve the problem of fodder shortage.

According to the general situation in agricultural areas, the work of storing fodder should be carried out from three aspects: protecting crop stalks, saving fodder, and opening up fodder sources.

In terms of protecting crop stalks, all kinds of crop stalks, vines, and peels (such as wheat straw, pea vines, rice straw, bean stalks, corn stalks, sweet potato vines, peanut vines, husks, bean chaff, sorghum leaves, cotton leaves, etc.) that can be used as livestock feed should be properly stored as early as possible. The method is to choose a high and dry place, cover it with weeds or wheat bran, and pile the stalks and vines layer by layer into round or long stacks, then cover the top with mud. In areas prone to flooding, the base should be raised, the stacks should be tightly sealed, and drainage ditches should be dug to prevent rain and snow from wetting and rotting the fodder. The habit of farmers in some areas is to chop wheat straw, sorghum leaves, vines, bean vines, and bean leaves into flower and grass stacks. The feed made in this way is not only nutritious, but also loved by livestock. This method should be promoted.

Saving fodder is of great significance to solving the problem of livestock feed at present. The main ways to save are: first, in areas where fodder is used as fuel, weeds, stalks, or branches that cannot be fed to livestock should be used to replace fuel. In areas with convenient transportation and conditions, the use of coal should be encouraged. Areas with surplus grass should not waste fodder at will, and should be transferred to nearby areas lacking fodder through supply and marketing cooperatives. Second, during slack farming periods, livestock can be grazed on grasslands on hillsides, riverbanks, field edges, and vacant land. Third, organize households lacking firewood but with surplus grass to exchange grass for firewood with households lacking grass but with surplus firewood, to reduce fodder waste. Fourth, improve fodder preparation and feeding methods. Some places crush, sieve, and wash the harder stalks and vines, and adopt a reasonable feeding method of "mix less, mix frequently, and mix again after eating," which can save fodder. Using green grass, wild vegetables, and various leaves to ferment and feed pigs can also save part of the feed. All localities should summarize and promote the original good experiences among the masses.

Opening up fodder sources in many ways is the fundamental way to solve the problem of fodder shortage, but in the past, all localities have not done enough in this work. To open up grass sources, we must first seize the time to sun-cut wild grass. From now until the frost, there are still a few months, which is the season when green grass is lush. Before flowering and fruiting, the basal leaf nutrients of green grass are richer than those of general stalks. Cutting, drying, and storing them in autumn to feed livestock not only saves grass, but also saves feed. Mountainous areas and areas with wasteland should pay attention to this work. Areas along lakes or rivers can salvage aquatic weeds and sun-dry them into hay. Second, actively plant fodder. Agricultural production cooperatives can use forest garden gaps, drying grounds, or allocate some thin land and wasteland to plant fodder; farmers with less land can also use the edges of fields and corners of houses to plant some fodder. Special attention should be paid to green and juicy feed, such as the cultivation of red carrots, melons, and alfalfa. In some plain areas and saline-alkali areas where feed is often lacking year-round, the cultivation of alfalfa should be expanded; because alfalfa not only has a large yield and low cost, but also can improve the soil. In areas prone to flooding and water accumulation, high-yield feed crops such as densely planted sorghum can be planted. Third, the method of green fodder silage should be promoted. In corn-producing areas, corn stalks can be cut green after ear picking, and green silage can be dug in cellars. This can not only supplement the shortage of fodder in winter and spring, but also save feed because green silage is nutritious and palatable. Other areas can also collect fresh sweet potato stalks, densely planted sorghum, green grass, etc., according to specific conditions, and dig cellars or semi-underground cellars to try green silage. In disaster-stricken areas and special product areas, supply and marketing cooperatives can be organized to purchase fodder for farmers in appropriate seasons. In general areas lacking grass, fodder markets can be established to carry out fodder transfer, so that agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and individual households with livestock can store enough fodder for one year.

Now is the fodder storage season, and party committees and governments at all levels must strengthen their leadership over the work of protecting and storing grass, and mobilize agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and the broad masses of farmers to launch a mass movement to protect and store grass. Through methods such as checking livestock, checking feed, checking potential, and making detailed accounts, effective plans and methods for protecting grass, saving grass, and planting fodder should be determined based on the experience of the masses. State-owned and local state-owned farms in all localities should do a better job in protecting and saving fodder, and actively plant fodder to support farmers lacking grass with surplus grass. Leading bodies in all localities can organize the masses to visit areas where fodder storage work is done well, to exchange experiences. In the work of fodder storage, attention should also be paid to fire prevention, and counter-revolutionaries should be strictly prevented from destroying fodder.

    发动群众大力贮备牲畜饲草
    彭干青
    许多地区由于饲草缺乏，每当冬春季节都有大量牲畜瘦弱、死亡，在这两个季节中，农村中出卖和宰杀牲畜的数量也最多。显然，这种情况对于发展农业和畜牧业都是非常不利的，我们必须接受这一教训，尽一切可能克服发展畜牧业和饲草供应之间的矛盾。为此，各地必须抓紧目前野草生长繁茂的季节和即将到来的秋收季节，组织广大群众，做好饲草收割和贮存工作。
    许多地区过去对贮备饲草工作是重视不够的。有些领导机关往往认为作物藁秆是副产品，似乎不关重要，或者认为群众自己会准备饲草，因而对贮备饲草采取了放任的态度，以致缺草问题不好解决。在群众方面，普遍有草乱用，很少精打细算，节约用草。因此，每年冬春，各地都感到饲草缺乏，牲畜喂养困难。部分地区甚至出现了扒房草，喂麦苗，草比粮贵，草比柴贵等反常现象。许多农民大量出卖和宰杀牲畜，使农村畜力遭受到大量损失。
    改善饲草供应状况的可能性是有的。首先，农村互助合作组织的蓬勃发展，劳力、土地的统一使用，已为贮草、种草工作的开展提供了有利条件。其次，某些地区高产作物（如甘薯、玉米）的种植面积虽已扩大，但蔓藤秆秸的利用率还很低，山草也未很好利用，有些地区的饲草还有大量浪费。改变这种情况，就会有助于缺草问题的解决。
    根据一般农业地区的情况看，开展贮备饲草工作，应从保护作物藁秆、节约饲草、开辟饲草来源等三方面着手。
    在保护作物藁秆方面，应及早将能用作牲畜饲草的各种作物的藁秆、蔓藤、皮壳（如麦秸、豌豆秧、谷草、稻草、豆秸、玉米秆、甘薯秧、花生秧、角皮、豆糠、高粱叶、棉叶等）妥善保存。办法是：选择高而干燥的地方，铺以杂草或麦糠，将藁秆、蔓藤等层层堆集成圆垛或长垛，然后涂泥盖顶。在容易发生水患的地区，应垫高基地，垛紧封好，加挖排水沟，以防雨雪浸湿，饲草霉烂。有些地区农民的习惯是把麦草、高粱叶、蔓藤、豆秧、豆叶等铡碎混为花草堆垛，这样制成的饲料不但营养好，而且牲口爱吃。这个办法应该提倡。
    节约饲草在目前解决牲畜饲料问题上有很大意义。节约的办法主要是：一、在以饲草作燃料的地区，应用不能喂牲畜的杂草、秆秸或枝柴等来代替燃料。交通便利和有条件的地区，应提倡烧煤。有余草的地区不要随便糟塌饲草，应通过供销社调剂给附近缺饲草的地区。二、农活闲暇时，可利用山坡河边、地头、隙地的草地放牧牲畜。三、组织缺柴余草户同缺草余柴户互换草柴，减少饲草的浪费。四、改善饲草的调制和喂养方法。有的地方把茎秆较硬的藁秆、蔓藤，碾碎、筛净、淘好，采取“少拌勤拌吃完再拌”的合理喂养方法，可以节省饲草。利用青草、野菜和各种叶子发酵喂猪，也可节省部分饲料。各地应对群众中原有的好经验加以总结和推广。
    多方面地开辟饲草来源，是解决饲料缺乏问题的根本办法，但以往各地对这一工作都做得很不够。要开辟草源，首先应抓紧晒割野草。从目前到霜降，还有几个月时间，这是青草繁茂的季节，青草在开花结实以前，基叶养分较一般藁秆丰富，在秋季刈割、晒干、贮放起来喂牲畜，不但省草，还能省料。山区和有荒田废地的地区，都应重视这个工作。滨湖或沿河的地区，可捞水杂草晒制干草。其次，要积极种植饲草。农业生产合作社可利用林园隙地、晒场或划出部分薄地、废地种植饲草；土地少的农户也可利用田边、屋角种植一部分饲草。应该特别注意青绿多汁饲料，如红萝卜、瓜类和苜蓿的栽培。在某些平原地区、沙碱区，饲料常年缺乏，应扩大苜蓿的栽培；因为苜蓿不但产量大，成本低，而且可以改良土壤。易遭水灾和积水的地区，可种植密植高粱等高产饲料作物。再次，应推广饲草青贮的办法。在玉米产区，可在采穗后趁青刈割玉米秸秆，挖窖青贮，这不但可以补助冬春饲草的不足，而且由于青贮饲料营养丰富，适口性大，还可以省料。其他地区也可根据具体情况采集新鲜的甘薯梗、密植高粱、青草等，挖地窖或半地下窖试行青贮。在受灾地区和特产区可在适当季节组织供销社为农民购入饲草。一般缺草地区，可设立饲草市场，开展饲草调剂，使有牲口的农业生产合作社、互助组和单干户都能贮存足够一年用的饲草。
    目前正是贮草季节，各级党委和政府必须加强对保草贮草工作的领导，发动农业生产合作社、互助组和广大农民开展一个群众性的保草贮草运动，通过查牲畜、查饲料、查潜力和算细账等方式，根据群众经验定出有效的保草省草和种植饲草的计划、办法。各地国营和地方国营农场更应做好饲草的保护和节约工作，积极种植饲草，以余草支援缺草农民。各地领导机关可以组织群众到贮草工作做得较好的地区观摩，以交流经验。在贮草工作中，还应注意防火，严防反革命分子毁坏饲草。
