    China Yue Opera Troupe in the German Democratic Republic

    In the minds of the German people, the lotus flower is the most beautiful flower in China. The Chinese Yue Opera performed in the German Democratic Republic was honored with this beautiful title.
    It should be said that it is not easy for European audiences to understand classical dramas from the distant East that have strong national characteristics. However, through the performances of the Chinese Yue Opera Troupe, the German people have developed a great interest in Chinese classical drama. This is not only because of the humanitarian ideas and realistic spirit reflected in this art, nor is it only because it reflects the lives and struggles of ordinary people that we are all familiar with, but also because of the performances of the actors themselves. Their skilled and graceful performances gave the audience a deep impression.
    Many introductions and reviews were published in the Berlin democratic district newspapers and important West Berlin newspapers regarding the Chinese Yue Opera Troupe's performances in the German Democratic Republic. All newspapers agreed that Chinese Yue Opera not only has a distinct national style, but also further developed many artistic elements. The natural and simple singing of the actors also made Europeans happy to listen.
    The high praise given to Chinese Yue Opera by various newspapers reflects the German people's sincere love for Chinese classical drama. In every performance of Yue Opera, the German people's great interest in Yue Opera can be seen from the applause that became more and more enthusiastic each time, and from the cheers that constantly came from the hearts of the audience. I remember that on the fourth day of the Chinese Yue Opera Troupe's performance in Berlin, more than a hundred people stood in front of the "People's Theater" in the rain, most of whom hoped to get tickets for the next day's performance. But when they learned that the tickets had been sold out long before the Chinese Yue Opera Troupe arrived, they still refused to leave. In the audience hall, however, there was a completely different scene. Here, people held their breath and admired "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai," which they called "Butterfly Opera." The audience's emotions changed with the development of the plot. The "Tower Meeting" scene made many viewers sigh and sob. The audience was even more full of praise for the Chinese classical masterpiece "Romance of the West Chamber," starring Yuan Xuefen, a famous Yue Opera actress. German writer Geylakh wrote in the Berlin Evening News: "People can understand everything even though they don't understand the language. It can make people feel incomparable joy and infinite pain in their hearts in an indivisible moment. What a masterpiece of art! Sitting in my seat, I momentarily forgot everything around me." In particular, the last performance of the Yue Opera Troupe in Berlin was met with unprecedented enthusiasm from the audience. At the repeated requests of the audience, the actors had to bid farewell to the people of Berlin with as many as twenty-eight curtain calls.
    The Chinese Yue Opera's performances in Cottbus, Karl Marx City, and Weimar were also welcomed in the same way. The people of Cottbus arranged a very comfortable living environment for the Yue Opera Troupe. They placed gifts, letters, and flowers in the newly built dormitory of the railway workers' children's school. And they named this building "Mao Zedong Building" to commemorate the Chinese Yue Opera Troupe's performance here. In Weimar, the Chinese classical drama "Romance of the West Chamber" appeared for the first time on the stage of the world-renowned German National Theater, and it was unanimously praised by people in German cultural circles (including West Germany). The coordination of singing, dancing, music, and scenery in Yue Opera was greatly appreciated here. The Chinese Yue Opera Troupe also visited Altenburg, about seventy kilometers from Leipzig. This small city with 28,000 residents not only saw Chinese drama for the first time, but also received Chinese friends for the first time. Therefore, they were particularly courteous to guests from afar. After each performance, the audience was always reluctant to leave. They waited for a long time in front of the theater, hoping to see the Chinese actors again, shake hands with them, or ask them to sign autographs.
    In the German Democratic Republic, the Chinese Yue Opera Troupe performed only fourteen shows, with a total audience of more than 16,000 people, but its influence was much wider and deeper. As Premier Grotewohl said when he received the Chinese Yue Opera Troupe, this visit and performance by the Chinese Yue Opera Troupe was a major cultural and political event. Because its audience included not only people from all walks of life in the German Democratic Republic, but also many people from West Germany. West German public opinion reflected the profound impact of cultural exchange and close friendship between the Chinese and German people on the West German people. This performance enabled the German people to see the achievements of the Chinese people in developing theatrical art under the guidance of Chairman Mao's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new." Precisely because of this, every member of the Chinese Yue Opera Troupe knows deeply that every bouquet of flowers, every enthusiastic greeting, and every gift received from German friends contains such deep meaning and friendship!

    中国越剧团在德意志民主共和国
  　高虹
    在德国人民的印象中，荷花是中国最美丽的花朵。在德意志民主共和国演出的中国越剧，被荣幸地冠上了这个美丽的称号。
    应该说，欧洲观众要理解来自遥远东方的、具有浓厚民族色彩的古典戏剧，是一件不容易的事情。但是，通过中国越剧团的演出，使德国人民对中国的古典戏剧发生了极大的兴趣。这不仅因为这种艺术所反映的人道主义思想和现实主义精神，也不仅因为它所反映的是我们共同熟悉的普通人民的生活和斗争，而且也因为演员演出的本身。她们娴熟、优美的表演，给予观众以深刻的印象。
    对于中国越剧团在民主德国的演出，柏林民主区各报以及西柏林重要报刊，发表了许多介绍和评论。各报一致认为中国越剧不仅带有鲜明的民族风格，而且进一步发展了许多艺术因素。而演员唱腔的自然、朴素，也使欧洲人乐于倾听。
    各报给予中国越剧的高度评价，反映出德国人民对中国古典戏剧的真诚喜爱。在越剧的每一次演出中，都可以从一次比一次热烈的鼓掌声中，从观众们不断发自内心的喝彩声中，看出德国人民对越剧怀着极大的兴趣。记得中国越剧团在柏林演出的第四天，有一百多人冒着阵雨站在“人民剧场”门前，其中绝大多数人希望获得下一天的戏票。但当他们知道戏票早在中国越剧团到达之前就已售完的时候，他们仍不肯离去。而在观众大厅内，则又呈现出一幅完全不同的情景。这里的人们屏住呼吸，在欣赏他们称为“蝴蝶歌剧”的“梁山伯与祝英台”。观众的情绪随着戏剧情节的发展在变化。“楼台会”一场使许多观众叹息和啜泣。观众对于越剧名演员袁雪芬主演的中国古典名著“西厢记”，更是赞不绝口。德国作家盖拉赫在柏林晚报上这样写道：“人们虽然不通语言，然而能懂得一切。它能在无法分割的一瞬间内使人们的心坎里感受到无比的欢欣和无限的悲痛。这是何等的艺术杰作！我坐在我的座位上，倾时忘却了周围的一切。”特别是越剧团在柏林演出的最后一场，观众情绪的热烈更是前所未见。在观众们的再三要求之下，演员们不得不以多达二十八次的谢幕向柏林人民告别。
    中国越剧在科特布斯、卡尔·马克思城以及魏玛等地的演出，也受到了同样的欢迎。科特布斯的人民，为越剧团安排了一个非常舒适的生活环境。他们在新落成的铁路职工子弟学校宿舍内，放上了礼物、信件和鲜花。并且把这栋房子命名为“毛泽东大楼”，以纪念中国越剧团在这里的演出。在魏玛，中国的古典名剧“西厢记”第一次出现在具有世界声誉的德国国家剧院的舞台上，它得到了德国文化界人士（包括西德在内）的一致好评。越剧中歌唱、舞蹈、音乐、布景等各方面的协调一致，在这里受到极大的赞赏。中国越剧团也曾到过距莱比锡约七十公里的阿尔登堡。这个拥有二万八千居民的小城市，不仅是第一次看到中国戏剧，而且也是第一次接待中国朋友们。因此，他们对来自远方的客人是格外殷勤的。在每一次演出结束后，观众们总是迟迟不肯离去，他们长久地等待在剧场门前，希望再一次见到中国演员们，和他们握握手，或者请她们签名。
    在德意志民主共和国，中国越剧团虽然只演出了十四场，观众总共一万六千多人，但它的影响却是广泛深远得多的。正如格罗提渥总理在接见中国越剧团时所说的，中国越剧团的这次访问演出是具有重大的文化和政治意义的事件。因为它的观众不仅包括民主德国各阶层的人民，也包括许多来自西德的人士。西德舆论反映出中德两国人民之间文化交流和亲密友谊给予西德人民的深刻影响。这次演出使德国人民看到了中国人民在毛主席的“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针指导下发展戏剧艺术的成就。正因为是这样，所以中国越剧团的每一个成员都深深知道：从德国朋友们那里接受过来的每一束鲜花、每一句热情的祝辞和每一件礼物，都包含着多么深厚的意义和友情！　（柏林航讯）
