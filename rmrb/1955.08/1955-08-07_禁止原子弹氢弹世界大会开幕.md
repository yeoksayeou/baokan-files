Xinhua News Agency, Hiroshima, 6th: The World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs opened on the morning of the 6th in Hiroshima, the first city to suffer the atomic bombing by the United States. This conference is a major part of the international struggle day, called for by the World Peace Congress, designating August 6th as a day to demand disarmament and a complete ban on atomic weapons.

Two hours before the official opening of the conference, at 8:00 AM, representatives from various countries and all parts of Japan, along with approximately 50,000 Hiroshima citizens, gathered at the Atomic Bomb Victims Memorial Tower in Peace Memorial Park for a solemn memorial service to commemorate the victims of the American atomic bomb.

The Mayor of Hiroshima City, Tadao Watanabe, delivered a peace declaration at the memorial service, stating "The tragedy of Hiroshima must not be repeated." The declaration said: On this tenth anniversary of Hiroshima City's atomic bombing disaster, we solemnly commemorate those who were sacrificed by the atomic bombing here, and declare to the world our desire and determination to defend world peace. We will continue to shout "The tragedy of Hiroshima must not be repeated."

At 8:15 AM – the moment the American atomic bomb exploded over Hiroshima ten years ago – all the bells and whistles in the city sounded in unison, and everyone participating in the memorial service, along with all the citizens, observed a minute of silence for the atomic bomb victims. After the moment of silence, five hundred peace doves flew from the white memorial tower, soaring in the free sky.

At 10:00 AM, the conference opened at the Hiroshima Public Hall in Peace Memorial Park. A total of 5,000 people attended the conference, including representatives from various countries and all parts of Japan, as well as Hiroshima citizens. The conference elected Akira Kazami, Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan Tokutaro Fujita, former Mayor of Hiroshima City Shinzo Hamai, commentator Yoshio Nakano, and Shige Yamaoka, President of the National Liaison Council of Regional Women's Groups, as chairpersons of the presidium of the conference.

The conference then introduced twenty-one representatives from more than ten countries, including the United States, France, Italy, India, Indonesia, Poland, and North Korea, including Nino Frieralezi, Secretary of the World Peace Council.

Ikuo Yasui, Secretary-General of the National Council for the Signature Campaign Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and Professor at Hosei University, reported on the situation of the anti-atomic and hydrogen weapons movement in various countries at the conference. He said: The total number of signatures worldwide against atomic weapons has now exceeded 600 million. Taking advantage of this conference, we must further develop this signature campaign in order to create a peaceful world without atomic and hydrogen bombs. His report was welcomed with enthusiastic applause.

Subsequently, the conference read out approximately thirty congratulatory telegrams from Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama, former Prime Minister Naruhiko Higashikuni, renowned physicist Hideki Yukawa, and peace groups from more than ten countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada.

At 2:00 PM, the conference continued. Representatives from ten countries, including Jacques, Secretary of the National Peace Council of France, Professor Susnowski of Atomic Physics at the University of Warsaw, and Vasilkovska, a member of the Polish Council for the Defense of Peace, delivered speeches at the conference. In their speeches, they unanimously emphasized the threat posed by atomic and hydrogen bombs to humanity and expressed deep sympathy for the victims of the Hiroshima atomic bombing. Their speeches were warmly welcomed. Byakuren Yanagihara, whose only son was taken away by the war, recited her own song "Song Dedicated to the Victims of the Atomic Bomb." Afterwards, Japanese representatives made reports on the atomic and hydrogen bomb issue at the conference. Renowned peace fighter Yoshitaro Hirano spoke on the theme of "International Solidarity," calling for consultations among countries to strive for the declaration of atomic and hydrogen bombs as illegal. Representatives of atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki recounted the tragic circumstances of their suffering at the conference. Suzu Kuboyama, the wife of Aikichi Kuboyama, a Japanese fisherman who lost his life to the American hydrogen bomb, made a painful accusation at the conference, demanding a ban on atomic and hydrogen bombs. Her accusation deeply moved those attending the conference.

The first day of the conference ended at 6:00 PM.

The conference will continue to be held in Hiroshima on the 7th and 8th, and is scheduled to hold a closing conference in Tokyo on August 15th.
