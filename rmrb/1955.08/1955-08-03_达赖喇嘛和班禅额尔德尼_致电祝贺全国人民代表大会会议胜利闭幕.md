Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, August 2nd: The Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the Dalai Lama Danzeng Gyatso, sent a telegram to the Standing Committee congratulating the successful closing of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress. The telegram reads as follows:
To the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress:

    The Second Session of the First National People's Congress has been convened, and I would like to extend my congratulations as I am unable to attend due to other engagements.

    I fully agree with and support the reports made to the congress by the four Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Zihui, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

    Our country's First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy embodies the long-term interests of all fraternal ethnic groups throughout the country, and in particular, it has paid full attention to the development of economic and cultural undertakings in the Tibet region. For example, the full operation of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways, which are included in the Five-Year Plan, and the two decisions on the issue of transportation in Tibet and on assisting the local government of Tibet in construction, which were adopted by the seventh plenary session of the State Council in March of this year, undoubtedly create favorable conditions for consolidating our country's southwestern border defense, further strengthening the ties between Tibet and the interior of the motherland, carrying out various construction undertakings in Tibet,

    All of us, the monks and laypeople of Tibet, must, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, work together with the people of the whole country to realize the great First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. At the same time, we must work hard, with the selfless assistance of the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet and the working personnel in Tibet, to do a good job in the preparatory work for the Tibet Autonomous Region, consolidate the unity within Tibet and between fraternal ethnic groups, and build a new Tibet of the motherland.
                                                                                       Dalai Lama
                                                                                        August 1, 1955

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, August 2nd: Panchen Erdeni Qoiji Gyaltsen, Member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, sent a telegram to the Standing Committee congratulating the successful closing of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress. The telegram reads as follows:
To the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress:

    On the occasion of the successful closing of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, I would like to express my warm congratulations on the success of the meeting with great joy, and express my full support for the various resolutions passed by the meeting, such as our country's First Five-Year Plan. Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, all aspects of politics, economy, and culture are booming, the unity between the Tibetan ethnic group and all fraternal ethnic groups in the country, as well as the unity within Tibet, are becoming increasingly consolidated and close, and a new atmosphere has emerged that has never been seen in history. Now, the work of establishing the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is underway, which is a great happy event for the Tibetan people, and also embodies the wisdom and greatness of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy. With the help and care of the Central Government, we have full confidence in doing this work well. The main agenda items of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress fully embody the long-term interests of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and mark the increasing prosperity and strength of the motherland, which makes us more aware of the greatness and loveliness of the motherland's big family and the brotherly close relationship of equality, mutual assistance, friendship, and cooperation among all ethnic groups in the country. Realizing the First Five-Year Plan is the glorious responsibility of the people of the whole country and our Tibetan people. We are determined to work together with the people of the whole country to fully realize the First Five-Year Plan, build the motherland, and consolidate national defense. On the basis of the rapid development of the motherland's industrialization, Tibet's various construction undertakings will also be developed more rapidly. In recent years, thanks to the leadership and assistance of the Central Government, Tibet's economic landscape is changing. Following the opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways to Lhasa, the construction of the Lhasa-Shigatse and Shigatse-Gyangtse highways is being stepped up, and the Shigatse thermal power plant and urban flood control project have been surveyed. In the future, under the guidance of the First Five-Year Plan, we must work harder to build the motherland and build Tibet.
                                                                                        Panchen Erdeni
                                                                                        August 1, 1955

    我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，体现了全国各兄弟民族的长远利益，特别是对于西藏地区的经济事业和文化事业的发展给予了充分的注意。如包括在五年计划内的康藏、青藏两条公路的全线通车，和今年三月国务院第七次全体会议所通过的关于西藏交通运输问题和关于帮助西藏地方进行建设的两项决定，无疑地对于巩固我国西南边疆的国防，进一步密切西藏与祖国内地的联系，开展西藏的各项建设事业，创造了有利的条件。
    我们西藏全体僧俗人民一定要在中国共产党和各族人民伟大的领袖毛主席的领导下，与全国人民一道，为实现伟大的发展国民经济的第一个五年计划而奋斗。同时我们更要在人民解放军进藏部队和进藏工作人员的大公无私帮助下，为尽快地作好西藏自治区筹备委员会的工作，巩固西藏内部和兄弟民族之间的团结，建设祖国的新西藏而努力奋斗。		    达赖喇嘛		    公元一九五五年八月一日
