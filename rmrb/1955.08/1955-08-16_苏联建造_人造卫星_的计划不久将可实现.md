Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 14th (TASS): The Soviet Union has recently paid close attention to the study of the problem of interstellar transportation. In this regard, the first problem to be solved is the construction of an "artificial satellite of the Earth." Preliminary measures have been taken to build an "artificial satellite of the Earth," that is, to build an automatic working laboratory that can exist in outer space for a long time.

Academician Sedov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences reported at the International Astronautical Congress, which closed last week, that there is now a practical basis for building an "artificial satellite."

There are now many plans for building "artificial satellites." These "artificial satellites" vary in size and weight—from a few kilograms to several tons. According to these plans, the satellite should rotate around the Earth at a high altitude where air resistance is no longer strongly felt. Possibly, the first such satellite will be at an altitude of 200 to 1,000 kilometers, and later ones at an altitude of 1,500 to 2,000 kilometers.

According to calculations, at an altitude of 2,000 kilometers, the satellite's speed is about seven kilometers per second, which means that the speed reached can offset the gravity of the flying laboratory with its centrifugal force. Obviously, the "artificial satellite of the Earth" will not orbit along the equator, but along an orbit around the Earth's poles. Due to the Earth's rotation, flying in this orbit can observe all parts of the Earth.

According to Soviet research, there is reason to predict that the plan to build an "artificial satellite of the Earth" will be realized in the near future.

    苏联建造“人造卫星”的计划不久将可实现
    新华社十五日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科十四日电：苏联最近十分注意星际交通的问题的研究。在这方面，首先要解决的是建造“地球的人造卫星”的问题。现已采取初步措施来建造“地球的人造卫星”，也就是建造能长期存在于宇宙空间的自动工作实验室。
    苏联科学院院士塞多夫在上星期闭幕的国际星际航行会议上报告说，现在具备有建造“人造卫星”的实际基础。
    现在已有许多建造“人造卫星”的计划，这些“人造卫星”大小不同，重量不同——从几公斤到几吨重。按照这些计划，卫星应在已经不大感得到空气阻力的高空围绕地球旋转。可能，第一个这样的卫星是在两百至一千公里的高空，以后的在一千五百至两千公里的高空。
    据计算，在两千公里的高空，卫星的速度约为每秒七公里，这就是说，所达到的速度已可使飞行实验室的重力被它的离心力所抵消。显然，“地球的人造卫星”不是顺赤道绕行，而是沿着环绕地球两极的轨道飞行。由于地球的自转，在这一轨道上飞行就可以对地球的各个部分进行观察。
    根据苏联进行的研究，有理由预测，建造“地球的人造卫星”的计划在不久的将来就可实现。
