    Qinghai Province recently organized a visiting group to Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to learn about the establishment of the dairy industry. The visiting group included eleven representatives from the Tibetan, Salar, Tu, and Han ethnic groups. They spent a month visiting six dairy factories in Hulunbuir League. During the visit, they saw casein (which can be used to make plywood, electrical materials, etc.) and lactose (which can be used to make penicillin) made from milk. They excitedly said: The dairy industry directly connects animal husbandry with national industrial construction! They were particularly interested in a small dairy processing plant they saw in Bairin. This processing plant has only eleven employees and a few simple tools, and it can process 1,500 jin of milk every day, and the product quality is quite good. According to the current conditions in the pastoral areas of Qinghai, it is very suitable to establish such small dairy processing plants.
    When the members of the visiting group set off to return to Qinghai on July 8, they all expressed that they would bring back the experience of Inner Mongolia and gradually establish the dairy industry in Qinghai Province.

    青海派人参观内蒙古乳品工厂
    青海省最近组织参观组到内蒙古自治区了解了建立乳品工业的情况。参观组包括藏族、撒拉族、土族和汉族的十一名代表。他们用一个月的时间在呼伦贝尔盟参观了六个乳品工厂。参观过程中看到用牛奶制成的酪胶（可用来制胶合板、电料等）和乳糖（可用来制青霉素），他们兴奋地说：乳品工业把牧业同国家工业建设直接联系起来了！他们对在巴林看到的一座小型乳品加工厂特别感到兴趣。这座加工厂只有十一名职工，几件简单的工具，每天能加工处理一千五百斤牛奶，产品质量还相当好。根据目前青海牧区的条件，很适宜于建立这种小型乳品加工厂。
    参观组组员们在七月八日动身回青海的时候纷纷表示，要很好地把内蒙古的经验带回去，逐步把青海省的乳品工业建立起来。
