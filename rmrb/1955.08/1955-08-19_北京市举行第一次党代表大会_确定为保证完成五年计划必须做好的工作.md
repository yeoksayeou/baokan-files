Xinhua News Agency, 17th Dispatch: The first congress of the Chinese Communist Party Beijing Municipal Committee was held from June 25th to July 3rd. A total of 682 delegates attended the congress.

The congress first heard the work report made by Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, on behalf of the Municipal Committee. This report summarized the achievements of Beijing in the six years since liberation, examined the shortcomings in the work, and based on the general line of the Party during the transition period and the spirit of the National Congress of the Communist Party of China, put forward the current specific tasks of the city's Party organizations.

The delegates held earnest and warm discussions on the work report. They unanimously supported the resolutions of the National Congress of the Communist Party of China and agreed with the work report of the Municipal Committee.

The meeting unanimously held that since liberation, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Party organizations in Beijing, relying on the working class and uniting the people of the city, have carried out the restoration, transformation, and construction of the capital in various aspects at a rapid pace. Over the past six years, through successive political movements, the leading position of the working class in the country and society has been continuously consolidated, and the people's democratic dictatorship has been continuously consolidated. At the same time, the city's industrial and agricultural production has seen significant development. In all sectors of the national economy, the socialist component has risen rapidly. With the recovery and development of production, the people's material and cultural lives have been greatly improved. In various struggles and work, the Party organization has grown greatly. However, the meeting emphasized that one should not be complacent because of these achievements.

The meeting fully promoted democracy and consistently implemented the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. The delegates widely criticized the shortcomings in various construction aspects, such as work not being thorough, low quality, and lack of creativity. They exposed the bad styles of bureaucracy, red tape, and preoccupation with routine matters in the leading organs, and focused on criticizing the serious waste of manpower and materials in various aspects. The bourgeois complacency, liberalism, and especially the right-leaning paralysis of thought in the struggle against the enemy within the Party were deeply criticized. Through the discussion at the congress, everyone raised their awareness, strengthened the Party's unity, and, on the basis of more consistent thinking and will, put forward many constructive suggestions for improving the work.

The congress focused on discussing and determining the various tasks that must be concentrated on to ensure the completion of the country's first five-year plan. The meeting held that it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership, mobilize the people of the city, and work hard with the people of the whole country, be diligent and conscientious, overcome difficulties, increase production, practice strict economy, oppose waste, and strive to complete the country's first five-year plan. In the industrial sector, every effort must be made to ensure the timely completion of new industrial projects, fully exploit the potential of existing enterprises, continuously improve quality, increase labor productivity, reduce costs, increase new products, better serve the urban and rural people and national construction, and accumulate funds to support national construction. Local state-owned industries must take firm and effective measures to improve quality, overcome waste, and reduce costs. Capitalist industries must be reorganized and transformed step by step by industry in combination with the unified arrangements of local industries. For handicrafts, we must first concentrate our efforts on rectifying and running the existing handicraft cooperative organizations, and overcome the capitalist business style. In the commercial sector, we must vigorously improve the wholesale work of state-owned commerce, make overall arrangements for public-private commerce, and steadily and systematically transform private merchants. In the agricultural sector, we must concentrate our efforts on running the existing agricultural production cooperatives well, and then develop them in a planned way. We must improve urban construction, strengthen the leadership of construction and municipal engineering enterprises, and earnestly ensure project quality and reduce costs. The meeting held that the Party's leadership over higher education should be strengthened to further improve the quality of cultural, educational, and health work. To this end, we should creatively combine China's specific conditions and better learn from the advanced educational experience of the Soviet Union, and vigorously train and improve the existing teachers.

The meeting held that the spirit of practicing strict economy and opposing waste must be implemented in all work. All organs, enterprises, and institutions must strictly streamline their organizations and reduce their staffing. At the same time, we must mobilize the people of the city to vigorously carry out the work of saving food.

The meeting also pointed out that it is necessary to heighten revolutionary vigilance and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries; at the same time, strengthen the people's democratic united front, unite the broad masses of the people, and build socialism.

The meeting called for improving the Party's leadership style. Strengthen collective leadership and division of labor with individual responsibility. The Municipal Committee and various departments must regularly and systematically understand and analyze the situation, put forward the central issues in the current work to be solved, and go deep into the grassroots, grasp and utilize typical examples to promote and guide the work.

Finally, Peng Zhen made a summary of the congress discussion on behalf of the presidium of the congress.

The congress elected 42 members of the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, 17 alternate members; the secretary, deputy secretaries, members, and alternate members of the CPC Beijing Municipal Supervisory Committee, 20 in total. The congress unanimously adopted the resolution endorsing the "Resolution of the National Congress of the Communist Party of China on the Anti-Party Alliance of Gao Gang and Rao Shushi" and the resolution on the work report of the Municipal Committee.
