    Yumen Oilfield Supports Exploration in Qaidam

    Yumen Oilfield is vigorously supporting petroleum exploration work in the Qaidam Basin. Recently, the Yumen Mining Bureau decided to transfer all the drivers and other staff, along with all vehicles, from the Third Transportation Brigade of the Transportation Department to transport machinery, equipment, grain, coal, and other necessities for the petroleum exploration personnel in the Qaidam Basin.

    This transportation brigade is responsible for the transportation task from Wuwei in Gansu, through the Hexi Corridor, via Dunhuang, to the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai. This route is more than 1,500 kilometers long, with treacherous roads, crossing deep mountains and ridges at the junction of Qinghai, Gansu, and Xinjiang provinces, and passing through hundreds of kilometers of the Gobi Desert. Since July 16th, the Yumen Mining Bureau's Transportation Department has sent people to various locations along the route to understand the route conditions and establish stations and offices. At the same time, they began to overhaul all the vehicles of the Third Transportation Brigade and prepare to establish a well-equipped automobile repair and maintenance workshop in Dunhuang.

    This transportation team will depart from Jiuquan in early August and head to the Qaidam Basin.

    玉门油矿支援柴达木的勘探
    玉门油矿大力支援柴达木盆地的石油勘探工作。最近，玉门矿务局决定把运输处第三运输大队的全部司机等工作人员和全部车辆抽调出来，为柴达木盆地的石油勘探人员运输机械、器材、粮食、煤和其他生活用品。
    这支运输大队担负着从甘肃武威、穿过河西走廊，经敦煌到青海柴达木盆地的运输任务。这条路长达一千五百多公里，道路艰险，要跨越青海、甘肃、新疆三省交界的深山峻岭，通过数百公里的戈壁滩。从七月十六日起，玉门矿务局运输处已经派人到沿途各地了解线路情况，筹建车站和办事机构；同时，开始检修第三运输大队的全部车辆，并准备在敦煌建立一座设备齐全的汽车修理保养工场。
    这支运输队伍将在八月初从酒泉出发前往柴达木盆地。
