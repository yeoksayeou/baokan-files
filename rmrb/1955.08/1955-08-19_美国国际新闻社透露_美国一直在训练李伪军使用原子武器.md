    U.S. International News Service Reveals
    The U.S. Has Been Training the Li Pseudo-Army to Use Atomic Weapons
    Xinhua News Agency, August 18th: According to a Washington dispatch from the International News Service, reliable sources stated on the 17th that "the United States has been training South Koreans in the tactical use of atomic weapons."
    The report says that the atomic cannons shipped to the U.S. forces on Okinawa will eventually be shipped to South Korea. However, the report admits that according to the Korean Armistice Agreement, the United States cannot give atomic cannons to South Korea. Therefore, whether the United States will abide by this restriction "is questionable." The report revealed the U.S. attempt to break this restriction by violating the armistice agreement, saying, "Once the United Nations makes South Korea free from this restriction, the door will be opened to shipping atomic weapons to the South Korean government."
    The report also revealed that when the United States withdrew some of its troops from South Korea in the past, it "transferred a lot of equipment to the South Koreans."

    美国国际新闻社透露
    美国一直在训练李伪军使用原子武器
    新华社十八日讯　据国际新闻社华盛顿电引可靠人士十七日的谈话说，“美国一直在训练南朝鲜人学习原子武器的战术使用”。
    消息说，运给冲绳岛美军的原子大炮最后将运往南朝鲜。但是，消息承认，根据朝鲜停战协定，美国不能把原子大炮给予南朝鲜。因此，美国是否将遵守这种限制，“是成问题的”。消息透露美国企图用破坏停战协定来打破这种限制说，“一旦联合国使南朝鲜不受这种限制，那末运原子武器给韩国政府的大门就将敞开。”
    消息还透露，美国在过去从南朝鲜撤走一部分美国军队时，“曾把很多装备转交给南朝鲜人”。
