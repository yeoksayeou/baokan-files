Is there not much "gravy" to be saved in small factories and mines?
Ji Tong

In mid-July, the CPC Shaoyang Prefectural Committee of Hunan Province convened a meeting of Party and administrative leading personnel from industrial and transportation enterprises to deploy a struggle to practice strict economy and oppose waste. Among the leading staff of local state-owned factories and mines attending the meeting, a prevailing argument initially went like this: our factories and mines are small, not like the Xikuangshan Mining Bureau, Zhuzhou Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory... they are large and wasteful, with great potential for savings; we have little capital, can complete the plan, and waste is not serious. If we are to economize, there isn’t much "gravy" to be squeezed out!

The meeting sharply criticized this erroneous argument, pointing out that these comrades were satisfied with the completion of output, output value, and profit delivery plans, and had insufficient understanding of waste and huge potential in enterprises. In fact, small factories and mines do not mean that waste is small and there is not much "gravy." Take Xinhua Arsenic Mine as an example: the mine's total output value in the first half of this year exceeded 12 percent, red arsenic production exceeded 11.72 percent, and profit delivery exceeded 54 percent. Some leading staff and workers of the mine once thought that "the management of our mine is almost perfect, and there is no waste." However, further analysis reveals that they often and extensively work overtime; the number of production workers in the first quarter exceeded the plan by three people; they used more than 100 tons of arsenic concentrate (raw materials) and more than 40 tons of arsenic ash (semi-finished products) left over from last year; although the quality of the product red arsenic is good, the quality of arsenic concentrate and arsenic ash is low, affecting the smelting recovery rate, which has long failed to meet the national target. As a result, more than 500 tons of arsenic concentrate were consumed in the first half of this year. Out of the 18 technical and economic indicators for the whole mine in the first half of the year, only seven, including labor and pit wood consumption, were completed. Therefore, the total cost in the first half of the year exceeded the plan by 3.12 percent.

The situation of Xinhua Arsenic Mine is not an isolated case among local industrial enterprises in the Shaoyang area. The meeting exposed many cases of waste. For example, the Shaoyang Machinery Factory suffered more than 10,000 yuan in losses from defective products and fines for delayed delivery in the first half of this year, and the man-hours for rework in half a year exceeded 80 percent of the total for the entire last year; since the end of last year, the Anping Iron Factory has had continuous accidents in the blast furnace, with repair costs amounting to more than 30,000 yuan, and the output value reduced due to downtime reached more than 100,000 yuan. Many factories and mines cannot fully complete their technical and economic indicators. According to incomplete statistics from only 15 factories and mines, the waste and backlog of materials over the years amount to more than 500,000 yuan. Obviously, if the leading staff and workers of each factory and mine can make efforts to plug these loopholes and practice strict economy, they can accumulate a large sum of funds for the country.

However, some leading staff of factories and mines emphasize: we admit that there are loopholes in production; but our small factories and mines do not have luxurious buildings, large roofs, or leather sofas... how much "gravy" can we squeeze out from non-productive facilities and management expenses? The meeting pointed out that this statement is also wrong. Facts prove that not every small factory and mine has implemented the principle of strict economy in non-productive facilities and other aspects. Some people are still envious and pursuing "generosity" and "ostentation." For example, Niumasi Coal Mine spent more than 7,000 yuan to purchase laboratory equipment and refrigerators for the health station; four factories and mines, including Longhui Lead-Zinc Mine, bought imported computers, which were not urgently needed in practice. Recently, after the Hunan Provincial Department of Industry initially reviewed the basic construction plan submitted by Shaoyang Rosin Factory, it changed the factory's walls to bamboo fences, appropriately reduced the office area, and postponed the construction of family housing, saving the country more than 30,000 yuan in investment. Therefore, whether from an economic point of view or from the perspective of promoting a spirit of hard work and simplicity and raising the socialist consciousness of workers, it is absolutely necessary to require small factories and mines to implement the principle of economy in terms of living welfare facilities and management expenses.

The leading staff of local industrial enterprises attending the meeting, after discussion and analysis, unified their understanding and decided to practice strict economy and oppose waste. Some also put forward specific economy methods and goals based on the situation of their own units. Shaoyang Tannery plans to further improve the quality of cattle and pig skins, which will increase income by more than 10,000 yuan by the end of the year. Shaoyang Electric Company plans to coordinate with brother factories to adjust power load and utilize existing equipment to increase power generation by 400,000 to 500,000 kilowatt-hours by the end of the year.

    小厂矿节约的“油水”不多吗
    季通
    七月中旬，中共湖南省邵阳地委会召开工业交通企业党、行政领导工作人员会议，布置开展厉行节约、反对浪费的斗争。出席会议的地方国营厂矿领导工作人员中，最初盛行这么一种论调：我们的厂矿小，不比锡矿山矿务局、株洲机车车辆修理工厂……他们家大业大浪费多，节约潜力大；我们资金少，都能完成计划，浪费并不严重，要节约，“油水”实在不多呀！
    会议尖锐地批判了这种错误论调，指出这些同志满足于产量、产值和上缴利润计划的完成，对企业中的浪费现象和巨大潜力认识不足。事实上，小厂矿并不是浪费不大“油水”不多的，以新化砒矿为例：该矿今年上半年总产值超过百分之十二以上，红砒产量超过百分之十一点七二，上缴利润超过百分之五十四以上。该矿部分领导工作人员和职工曾因此认为“本矿管理工作差不多了，没有什么浪费。”可是，进一步分析一下，就会发现：原来他们经常、大量地加班加点；第一季度生产工人超过计划三人；利用了去年结存的百多吨砒精矿（原料）、四十多吨砒灰（半成品）；产品红砒的质量虽好，但砒精矿、砒灰质量低下，影响冶炼收回率长期达不到国家指标，今年上半年因此多消耗了五百多吨砒精矿。全矿上半年十八项技术经济指标，只完成了人工、坑木消耗量等七项。因此，上半年总成本超过计划百分之三点一二。
    像新化砒矿的情况，在邵阳地区的地方工业企业中并不是个别的。会议揭发了许多浪费事例。比如，邵阳机械厂今年上半年的废品损失、误期交货遭受的罚款共一万多元，半年的返工废活工时超过去年全年百分之八十；安平铁厂从去年年底以来，高炉连续发生事故，修理费用损失三万多元，因停工减少的产值达十多万元。许多厂矿技术经济指标不能全面完成，仅据十五个厂矿不完全的统计，年来器材的浪费、积压价值达五十万元以上。显然，各个厂矿的领导工作人员和职工，如果能努力堵塞这些漏洞，厉行节约，是能为国家积累很大一笔资金的。
    然而，还有些厂矿的领导工作人员强调说：生产上有漏洞，我们承认；但我们小厂矿没有豪华的建筑，没有盖大屋顶，买皮沙发……我们从非生产性设施、管理费用上又挤得出多少“油水”呀！会议指出：这种说法也是错误的。事实证明：就在非生产性设施等方面，并不是每一个小厂矿都贯彻了严格节约的方针，有些人还在羡慕、追求“大方”和“阔气”。如牛马司煤矿就花了七千多元添置保健站的化验设备和冰箱等；隆回铅锌矿等四个厂矿都买了进口的计算机，实际上这些计算机都不是迫切需要的。最近，邵阳松脂厂提出的基本建设计划经省工业厅初步审核后，把厂区的围墙改为竹篱，适当缩小办公室面积，缓建家属住宅等，就为国家节约投资三万多元。因此，无论从经济意义上看，从提倡艰苦朴素的风气、提高职工社会主义觉悟看，要求小厂矿在生活福利设施、管理费用等方面贯彻节约原则，是完全必要的。
    出席会议的地方工业企业领导工作人员，经过讨论、分析，统一了认识，都决定要厉行节约、反对浪费，有的还根据本单位的情况提出了具体节约办法和目标。邵阳制革厂打算进一步提高牛皮、猪皮质量，到年底约可增加收入一万多元。邵阳市电气公司计划配合兄弟工厂调整电力负荷，利用现有设备，到年底可增加四十至五十万度发电量。
