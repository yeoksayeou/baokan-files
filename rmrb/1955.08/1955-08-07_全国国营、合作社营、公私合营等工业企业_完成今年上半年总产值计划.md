    Complete This Year's First Half Gross Output Value Plan

    (By this newspaper) According to statistics from the State Statistical Bureau, in the first half of 1955, the gross output value of all national state-owned, cooperative-operated, joint state-private, and private industrial enterprises across the country completed 101.7% of the plan for the first half of the year, accounting for 48.4% of the annual plan. Among them, state-owned enterprises completed 105.2%, accounting for 50.8% of the annual plan; cooperative-operated enterprises completed 100.6%, accounting for 38.2% of the annual plan; and joint state-private enterprises completed 80.9%, accounting for 39.6% of the annual plan.
    In the first half of 1955, the gross output value of industrial enterprises nationwide increased by 7.8% compared to the first half of 1954. Among them, state-owned enterprises increased by 14.2%, cooperative-operated enterprises increased by 7.1%, the comparable portion of joint state-private enterprises increased by 7.7%, and the comparable portion of private enterprises decreased by 6.7%.
    The percentages of plan fulfillment and growth rates for each industrial ministry in the first half of the year are as follows: The Ministry of Fuel Industry completed 98.8% of the plan, an increase of 20% compared to the same period last year; the Ministry of Heavy Industry completed 105.3% of the plan, an increase of 29.3% compared to the same period last year; the First Ministry of Machine Building completed 104.8% of the plan, a decrease of 1.7% compared to the same period last year; the Ministry of Textile Industry completed 101% of the plan, a decrease of 10% compared to the same period last year; and the Ministry of Light Industry completed 102.1% of the plan, an increase of 7.7% compared to the same period last year.
    A comparison of the proportion of various types of industry in the national gross industrial output value in the first half of 1955 with that of 1954 shows: the proportion of state-owned industry increased from 59% to 62.3%; cooperative-operated industry decreased from 4% to 3.4%; joint state-private industry increased from 12% to 12.6%; and private industry decreased from 25% to 21.7%.
    In the national gross industrial output value, the proportion of production means increased from 42% in 1954 to 43.8%, while the proportion of consumer goods decreased from 58% to 56.2%.
    Among the thirty major industrial products, twenty completed the plan for the first half of the year, including pig iron, steel, rolled steel, copper, sulfuric acid, concentrated nitric acid, soda ash, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, cement, generators, transformers, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, gunny sacks, automobile tires, various types of paper, sugar, flour, and cigarettes. Among these, generators, transformers, gunny sacks, and various paper products exceeded the plan by more than 15%.
    Among the aforementioned thirty major industrial products, eleven completed more than 50% of the annual plan, including steel, rolled steel, copper, soda ash, ammonium nitrate, transformers, cotton cloth, gunny sacks, various types of paper, sugar, and flour. Compared to the first half of 1954, thirteen products increased by more than 20%, including crude oil, gasoline, pig iron, steel, rolled steel, caustic soda, soda ash, ammonium nitrate, cement, generators, double-wheel double-share plows, sugar, and flour; five products increased by 10% to 20%, including electricity, raw coal, copper, concentrated nitric acid, and various types of paper; and four products increased by less than 10%, including sulfuric acid, ammonium sulfate, rubber shoes, and edible vegetable oil.
    According to the monthly completion of plans by more than 2,800 key industrial enterprises in the first half of the year, although the gross output value plan was completed each month, the degree of completion tended to decline from April onwards, and more than 30% of enterprises failed to complete the monthly plan each month; 30% to 50% of the thirty major industrial products frequently failed to complete the monthly plan, such as metal cutting machine tools, which failed to complete the plan for six consecutive months, and raw coal, double-wheel double-share plows, and edible vegetable oil, which failed to complete the plan for five months. Only three products, pig iron, copper, and ammonium nitrate, were able to complete the plan each month.

    全国国营、合作社营、公私合营等工业企业
    完成今年上半年总产值计划
    本报讯　根据国家统计局的统计，一九五五年上半年全国国营、合作社营、公私合营和私营全部工业企业总产值完成上半年计划百分之一百零一点七，为全年计划的百分之四十八点四。其中国营企业完成百分之一百零五点二，为全年计划的百分之五十点八；合作社营企业完成百分之一百点六，为全年计划的百分之三十八点二；公私合营企业完成百分之八十点九，为全年计划的百分之三十九点六。
    一九五五年上半年全国工业企业总产值比一九五四年上半年增长了百分之七点八，其中国营的增长了百分之十四点二，合作社营的增长了百分之七点一，公私合营的可比部分增长了百分之七点七，私营可比部分降低了百分之六点七。
    各工业部完成上半年计划的百分比和增长速度是这样的：燃料工业部完成计划百分之九十八点八，比去年同期增长百分之二十；重工业部完成计划百分之一百零五点三，比去年同期增长百分之二十九点三；第一机械工业部完成计划一百零四点八，比去年同期下降百分之一点七；纺织工业部完成计划一百零一，比去年同期下降百分之十；轻工业部完成计划一百零二点一，比去年同期增长百分之七点七。
    一九五五年上半年各种类型工业在全国工业总产值中所占比重和一九五四年比较：国营工业比重从百分之五十九上升为百分之六十二点三；合作社营工业从百分之四下降为百分之三点四；公私合营从百分之十二上升为十二点六；私营从百分之二十五下降为百分之二十一点七。
    在全国工业总产值中，生产资料生产所占比重从一九五四年占百分之四十二上升为百分之四十三点八；消费资料生产从百分之五十八下降为百分之五十六点二。
    工业生产的三十种主要产品中，完成上半年计划的有二十种，计生铁、钢、钢压延品、铜、硫酸、浓硝酸、纯碱、硫酸铵、硝酸铵、水泥、发电机、变压器、棉纱、棉布、麻袋、汽车外胎、各种纸、糖、面粉和卷烟。其中发电机、变压器、麻袋和各种纸产品超过计划百分之十五以上。
    上述三十种主要工业产品中，完成全年计划在百分之五十以上的有钢、钢压延品、铜、纯碱、硝酸铵、变压器、棉布、麻袋、各种纸、糖和面粉等十一种。和一九五四年上半年比较，增长百分之二十以上的有原油、汽油、生铁、钢、钢压延品、烧碱、纯碱、硝酸铵、水泥、发电机、双轮双铧犁、糖和面粉等十三种；增长百分之十到百分之二十的有电力、原煤、铜、浓硝酸和各种纸等五种；增长百分之十以下的有硫酸、硫酸铵、胶鞋和食用植物油等四种。
    据上半年二千八百多个重点工业企业逐月完成计划的情况来看，虽然能逐月完成了总产值计划，但完成程度从四月份起趋于下降，并且每月都有百分之三十以上的企业不能完成月计划；三十种主要工业产品，有百分之三十到五十的品种经常完不成月计划，如金属切削机床连续六个月没有完成计划，原煤、双轮双铧犁和食用植物油都有五个月完不成计划，能逐月完成计划的只有生铁、铜和硝酸铵三种。
