Strive to Overfulfill the Agricultural Production Increase Task
    ——A Record of the Discussions on Agricultural Production Issues at the CPC Sichuan Provincial Representative Conference
    By Our Correspondent Ji Xichen
    The CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee convened a provincial representative conference from May 20th to June 10th. The conference held earnest discussions on how to strive to overfulfill the agricultural production increase task. Everyone pointed out that developing agriculture is the basic condition for ensuring the development of industry and completing the entire economic plan. Sichuan not only accounts for about one-tenth of the country's total grain output, but also has a variety of rich economic technical crops. Therefore, whether Sichuan can complete the agricultural production increase task is directly related to the realization of the country's socialist industrialization. Especially after the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is opened to traffic, it is necessary to transfer more grain to support national construction, so the party organizations in Sichuan Province must work diligently, overcome difficulties, and strive to increase grain production to make greater contributions to the country.
    In their speeches, the representatives criticized the blindly optimistic mood in agricultural production increase. Some comrades believed that Sichuan had already completed 15.9 percent of the grain production increase target in the Five-Year Plan in 1953 and 1954. It seemed that the remaining 7.9 percent of the production increase target for the next three years could be completed effortlessly. This idea is very harmful. The Suining County Party Committee suffered losses in agricultural production because of being satisfied with the existing achievements in production increase. They regarded the production increase achievements made in the past few years due to the efforts of the masses and even rainfall as capital for complacency, basking in their glory. They could not see the arduousness of agricultural production, ignored the threat of natural disasters to agriculture, and were unwilling to delve deeper into the problems in agricultural production. Therefore, they lacked planning and foresight in leading production, often only caring about the current season's crops and neglecting the connection and arrangement of the next season's production. In organizing the sowing of spring crops, Suining County excessively expanded the planting area of wheat, and the area of barley, broad beans, and other feed crops was greatly reduced as a result. At the same time, due to the failure to properly solve the fertilizer difficulties and properly connect the sowing of various crops, the production of cotton, the local main crop, was affected, causing losses to the country. The conference pointed out that it is an extremely arduous task to increase production every year in accordance with national requirements on the basis of the overall bumper harvest in 1954. Therefore, it is necessary to overcome blindly optimistic sentiments and conduct in-depth and specific leadership of agricultural production in order to complete the production increase tasks for the next three years.
    The conference believed that the most effective method to ensure the completion of the agricultural production increase task is to actively and step by step, on the basis of the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, rely on the poor peasants (including all new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants) to consolidate the unity of the middle peasants, and develop agricultural production cooperatives on a large scale. In this way, the investment is small and the returns are the fastest. According to the relatively accurate calculations of eleven agricultural cooperatives in Gongping Township, Wenjiang County, each cooperative can increase production by an average of 8 percent per year in three years. The conference believed that on the basis of consolidating the existing 28,800 cooperatives, it is necessary to continue to adopt the method of mass participation in establishing cooperatives, large-scale development, year-round preparation, and phased establishment of cooperatives. Efforts should be made to develop 85,000 cooperatives before the autumn harvest of 1955 and the spring plowing of 1956, with 2.63 million participating households (accounting for 20.77 percent of the total number of households). Before the spring plowing of 1957, the goal is to develop 160,000 cooperatives, with more than 6.38 million participating households, accounting for 50 percent of the total number of households, so as to achieve basic cooperation in most parts of the province during the first Five-Year Plan. In order to complete this glorious task, the party organizations in Sichuan Province must adopt highly strong working spirit, adopt appropriate methods of concentrated and large-scale development and in-depth key reliance on the leadership of branches to establish a large number of cooperatives. At the conference, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee conducted self-criticism of the shortcomings in leading the agricultural cooperation movement. Due to the fact that the Provincial Party Committee did not thoroughly understand the necessity of actively and steadily developing agricultural production cooperatives to meet the requirements of national construction; lacked sufficient courage to overcome some of the difficulties in the progress of cooperation; and lacked sufficient determination to implement the policy of actively and steadily developing agricultural production cooperatives, the Provincial Party Committee had agreed to inappropriately compress the originally planned number of cooperative establishments when determining the speed of cooperation in the province. During the discussion, everyone unanimously believed that as long as the whole party is mobilized, relies on the branches, and mobilizes the masses, Sichuan has sufficient conditions to complete the above-mentioned cooperative establishment plan. For example, the phenomena of varying degrees of violation of the principle of voluntary mutual benefit that occurred in the previous period have been basically eliminated, and the unity between the poor and middle peasants has been further consolidated on the basis of mutual benefit. The old cooperatives have also learned a set of experiences in improving management and management in doing a good job in production, showing the superiority of increasing production. At the same time, the vast number of peasants are actively requesting to join the cooperatives, and the mutual aid groups, which serve as the basis for establishing cooperatives, have been further developed. The ability of the branch leaders in various places to run the cooperatives has also been improved. In addition, more than 20,000 cadres who have initially gained experience in running cooperatives will continue to invest in the next step of cooperative establishment.
    The conference pointed out that in order to ensure the increase of agricultural production, it is also necessary to actively and steadily promote the reform of the agricultural cultivation system, tap the potential of agricultural production, and strive for multiple planting and multiple production. In this regard, Sichuan has many favorable conditions. For example, Sichuan has a warm climate, moderate rainfall, and very little frost and snow, so crops can be planted in all seasons. In addition, 50 percent of the province's winter idle land has not been well utilized, so the potential for agricultural production is great. Experience has proved that improving the farming system, increasing one season of planting, and promoting high-yield crops are effective ways to expand land utilization and increase agricultural production. In the autumn of 1954, Wenjiang Prefecture implemented the method of increasing one season of planting and intercropping and intercropping of various crops, and the output was generally increased by 30 to 40 percent compared with planting two seasons. Suining County adopted the method of "dry surface and muddy fields" to process the land. Although the seeds and fertilizers were the same, the sweet potatoes that had been dry and muddy on the surface increased production by 64 percent per mu. Other measures, such as actively developing fertilizer sources, rational fertilization, building farmland water conservancy, and promoting new agricultural implements and advanced farming techniques, also have significant effects on ensuring production increase and must be actively promoted.
    The conference believed that fully utilizing local conditions, actively developing diversified economy, developing legitimate rural sideline occupations and local specialties production is an effective way to support agricultural production increase. Sichuan Province has more than 700 kinds of local specialties, and various rural sideline occupations generally account for about 30 percent of the total income of farmers (more in mountainous areas). However, in the past two years, rural sideline occupations have generally shown a downward trend. For example, in some places, the production of fat pigs has decreased by 15 percent, and chickens have decreased by 10 percent. Sideline workshops and household handicrafts have also generally decreased. In addition to objective reasons, the main reason for this phenomenon is that there are many errors and shortcomings in the work, specifically manifested in the fact that many economic organizations have adopted erroneous and inappropriate restrictions on legitimate rural sideline occupations. Agricultural cooperatives only pay attention to the development of collective sideline occupations, but neglect the care and arrangement for the sideline production of cooperative members. At the same time, due to the excessively rigid and strict control of the prices of local specialties and the excessive market management procedures, this has dampened the production enthusiasm of farmers. The reduction of rural sideline occupations has affected the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and the turnover of rural economic life. Although this situation has been improved, it has not been fundamentally changed. In order to invigorate rural economic life, the conference believed that it is necessary to correct the phenomenon of restricting sideline occupations production from all aspects in the future, actively support the development of legitimate rural sideline occupations, improve market management and the purchase of local specialties, and at the same time develop sericulture, tea, tung oil, medicinal materials, etc. according to local conditions. Production, increase the planting of various economic trees, and use sideline occupations to support agricultural production.
    In order to ensure the increase of agricultural production, it is also necessary to actively build mountainous areas and start developing grasslands. Sichuan has 31 mountainous counties, with arable land accounting for 16 percent of the province, and agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry have huge potential. Dongyue Township, Dazhou County, relied on mutual aid and cooperative organizations, adopted the method of "opening ditches along the gullies, repairing ponds in the bays, and storing water in terraces" to fight against natural disasters. Last year, the township's grain production increased by 8 percent, and forestry and animal husbandry also had great development. In the future, it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of combining agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry and diversified operations, and actively develop mountainous production. In addition, Sichuan also has vast and fertile grasslands. In the future, it is necessary to conduct surveys and mapping in a planned manner, and actively prepare for the development of grasslands.
    The conference believed that the key to ensuring the implementation of the Five-Year Plan's decision lies in strengthening the specific leadership of agricultural production by party committees at all levels and correctly implementing the party's various policies in rural areas, and strengthening party unity, strengthening the party's political and ideological work, consolidating, consolidating, and developing the party's organization, and improving the party's combat effectiveness are the basic conditions for the victorious completion of the agricultural production increase task. In their speeches, the representatives, in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, examined the party's organizational and ideological status in various places, exposed the shortcomings and errors in the work, and put forward many constructive opinions. Everyone unanimously believed that in the arduous and complex struggle to implement the Five-Year Plan, the party organizations in Sichuan Province must be vigilant and constantly fight against the enemy's sabotage activities and the erosion of bourgeois ideology. At the same time, in order to strengthen the party's leadership, the secretaries of party committees at all levels must personally strengthen investigation and research, delve into agricultural production issues, and formulate practical and feasible production increase plans and specific measures based on the different natural and economic characteristics and cultivation techniques of various places, and strive to overfulfill the agricultural production increase task.

    争取超额完成农业增产任务
    ——记中共四川省代表会议对农业生产问题的讨论
    本报记者　纪希晨
    中共四川省委从五月二十日到六月十日召开了全省代表会议。会议对于如何争取超额完成农业增产任务问题，作了认真的讨论。大家指出：发展农业是保证发展工业和完成全部经济计划的基本条件。四川不仅粮食产量约占全国粮食总产量的十分之一，而且还有各种丰富的经济技术作物。因之，四川能否完成农业增产任务，直接关系着国家的社会主义工业化的实现。特别在宝成铁路通车之后，需要外调更多的粮食支援国家建设，所以四川省的党组织必须兢兢业业，克服困难，努力增产粮食，为国家作出更大的贡献。
    代表们在发言中，对于农业增产中的盲目乐观情绪进行了批评。有些同志认为：四川在一九五三年、一九五四年两年中，已经完成了五年计划中粮食增产指标的百分之十五点九，后三年只剩下百分之七点九的增产指标，似乎不费力气就可以完成了。这种想法是十分有害的。遂宁县委就因为满足于已有的增产成就，而使农业生产受到了损失。他们把过去几年来由于群众努力和雨水均匀而取得的增产成绩，当成骄傲自满的资本，沾沾自喜。他们看不到农业生产的艰巨性，忽视自然灾害对农业的威胁，不愿再深入钻研农业生产中的问题，因而在领导生产中缺乏计划性和预见性，往往只顾眼前一季作物，忽视了下一季生产的衔接和安排。在组织小春作物播种中，遂宁县就过多地扩大小麦播种面积，大麦、葫豆及其他饲料作物的面积因此大大减少了。同时由于未能很好解决肥料困难，和妥善衔接各种作物的播种工作，以致影响了当地主要作物棉花的生产，给国家带来了损失。会议指出：要在一九五四年全面丰收的基础上，再每年按照国家要求完成增产指标是一件极其艰巨的工作。因此，必须克服盲目乐观情绪，对农业生产进行深入具体的领导，才能完成今后三年的增产任务。
    会议认为，保证完成农业增产任务最有效的方法，是积极地有步骤地在自愿互利原则的基础上，依靠贫农（包括全部原来是贫农的新中农）巩固地团结中农，大量发展农业生产合作社。这样，投资少，收效也最快。据温江县公平乡十一个农业社比较精确的计算，三年中每个社平均每年可增产百分之八。会议认为：必须在巩固现有的两万八千八百个社的基础上，继续采用群众办社，大量发展，全年准备，分批建社的办法，争取在一九五五年秋收到一九五六年春耕前发展到八万五千个社，参加农户二百六十三万户（占总农户百分之二十点七七），一九五七年春耕前发展到十六万个社，参加农户六百三十八万余户，参加农户占总农户的百分之五十，在第一个五年计划内做到全省大部地区基本合作化。为完成这一光荣任务，四川省的党组织必须以高度坚强的工作精神，采取适当集中成片发展和深入重点依靠支部的领导方法大量建社。会议上，四川省委对领导农业合作化运动中的缺点进行了自我批评。由于过去省委对于必须积极稳步地发展农业生产合作社，以适应国家建设的要求，认识不透彻；对于战胜合作化前进中的若干困难，缺乏足够的勇气；对于贯彻积极稳步发展农业生产合作社的方针，缺乏足够的决心，以致在决定全省合作化的速度上，省委曾同意不适当的压缩了原定建社计划的数量。讨论中大家一致认为，只要全党动员，依靠支部，发动群众，四川是有足够条件完成上述建社计划的。例如，前一时期所发生的程度不同的违反自愿互利原则的现象，已基本上消除，贫农和中农之间的团结在互利基础上进一步得到了巩固，老社在搞好生产改进经营管理中也摸出了一套经验，显示了增产的优越性。同时，广大农民积极要求入社，作为建社基础的互助组有了更大的发展，各地支部领导办社的能力也有了提高。此外，还有两万多已初步获得办社经验的干部将继续投入下一步的建社工作中去。
    会议指出，为了保证农业增产，还必须积极稳步地推行农业耕作制度的改革，挖掘农业生产的潜力，争取多种多产。在这一方面，四川有许多有利条件。例如四川气候温暖，雨量适中，霜雪极少，一年四季都可以播种作物。加以全省尚有百分之五十的冬闲地尚未很好利用，因之，农业生产的潜力很大。经验证明：改进耕作制度，增种一季和推广高产作物，是扩大土地利用率、提高农业生产的有效办法。温江专区一九五四年秋在实行增种一季和各种作物间种、套种后，产量比种两季时普遍提高百分之三十至四十。遂宁县采用“面干田泥”办法，进行土地加工，虽然种籽肥料一样，但凡面了干田泥的红苕，每亩都增产百分之六十四。其他如积极开辟肥源，合理施肥，兴修农田水利，推广新式农具和先进耕作技术等，对保证增产也都具有显著作用，必须积极地推行。
    会议认为：充分利用当地条件，积极发展多种经济，发展农村正当副业和土特产生产是支持农业增产的有效方法。四川省土特产有七百多种，各种农村副业一般均占农民总收入的百分之三十左右（山地更多）。但近两年来，农村副业普遍有减少的趋势。如有些地方毛猪生产减少百分之十五、鸡减少百分之十。副业性的作坊、家庭手工业也普遍减少。产生这种现象，除了客观原因外，主要是工作中有不少错误和缺点，具体表现在：不少经济组织对农村正当副业采取了错误的不适当的限制办法。农业合作社只注意发展集体副业，而忽略了对社员个人副业生产的照顾和安排，同时由于对土特产价格掌握过死过严，市场管理手续太繁，这就打击了农民的生产积极性。农村副业的减少，影响了城乡物资交流和农村经济生活的周转。这种情况现在虽有改进，但还没有基本改变。为活跃农村经济生活，会议认为：今后必须从各方面纠正限制副业生产的现象，积极扶助发展农村的正当副业，改进市场管理和土特产的收购工作，同时因地制宜地发展蚕丝、茶叶、桐油、药材等生产，增植各种经济林木，用副业去支援农业生产。
    为保证农业增产，还需要积极建设山区，并着手开发草原。四川山区有三十一个县，耕地占全省百分之十六，农林牧业蕴藏着巨大的潜力。达县东岳乡依靠互助合作组织，采用“顺沟开埝、落湾修塘、分梯囤水”的办法，同自然灾害展开斗争，去年全乡粮食增产百分之八，林业和畜牧业也有很大的发展。今后必须继续贯彻农林牧相结合和多种经营的方针，积极发展山区生产。此外，四川还有辽阔肥沃的草原，今后必须有计划地进行调查、勘测，积极着手准备草原的开发工作。
    会议认为：保证五年计划实施的决定的关键，在于加强各级党委对农业生产的具体领导，正确贯彻党在农村中的各项政策，而加强党的团结，加强党的政治思想工作，整顿、巩固和发展党的组织，提高党的战斗力，则是胜利完成农业增产任务的基本条件。代表发言中，以批评和自我批评精神，检查了各地党的组织和思想状况，揭露了工作中的缺点和错误，并提出许多建设性的意见。大家一致认为：在实施五年计划的艰巨复杂的斗争中，四川省的党组织必须提高警惕，不断地同敌人的破坏活动，和资产阶级思想侵蚀进行斗争。同时，为着加强党的领导，各级党委书记必须亲自动手，加强调查研究，深入钻研农业生产问题，根据各地不同的自然、经济特点和耕作栽培技术，制定切实可行的增产计划和具体措施，为争取超额完成农业增产任务而奋斗。
