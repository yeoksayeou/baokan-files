The people of all countries are very satisfied with the results of their years of efforts to consolidate peace and international security. Their tireless struggle for peace has achieved initial results: no one can deny that international tensions have now eased to some extent.

The peace movement, born seven years ago at the initiative of a group of progressive social figures and cultural figures, has grown into a powerful force that governments and parliaments, politicians and national leaders cannot ignore.

The peace movement has made an inestimable contribution to eliminating the threat of war. It carried out such major international movements as the campaign to collect signatures for the Stockholm Declaration on the prohibition of atomic weapons (1950) and the campaign to collect signatures for the Declaration on the conclusion of a five-power convention (1951), which were supported by more than one billion people. The peace movement also organized a worldwide movement for resolving international disputes through consultation (1953), etc. The struggle of the people of all countries to defend peace played a major role in stopping the wars in Korea and Indochina.

The World Peace Assembly held in June powerfully demonstrated the indestructible will of millions of people to defend the great cause of peace. This meeting clearly showed that the desire for peace is the most ardent wish of people of all countries.

The demands of peace advocates are clear and specific: abandon the policy of strength and military blocs, stop the arms race, and stop the serious threat of atomic war. Peace-loving people of all countries demand to guarantee the security of all countries in Europe, to implement close economic and cultural cooperation between all countries, to reunify Germany into a peaceful, democratic country that does not participate in any military alliance, to ease tensions in the Far East, and to peacefully resolve pressing international issues in the Far East.

The foreign policy pursued by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the people's democratic countries, and other peace-loving countries meets these demands of the people of all countries and has received their firm support. The struggle of the people of all countries for peace has led to some easing of tensions in international relations and has created conditions conducive to resolving outstanding international issues.

The work of the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference held in July received close attention from the people of all countries in the world, and this conference was an important turning point in relations between Eastern and Western countries. At the formal meetings of the four-power heads of government and in informal conversations, they established personal contact and exchanged views on some of the most important issues in the international situation.

Peace-loving people of all countries are satisfied to see that the spirit of cooperation and mutual understanding is the main characteristic of the Four-Power Conference. All those who cherish peace and security welcome the positive results of the Geneva Conference, which laid the foundation for building trust between countries with different political and social systems.

The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in October will further study the issues discussed at the Geneva Conference, and the people of all countries firmly demand that this Foreign Ministers' Conference take further steps to resolve outstanding international issues.

The results of the Four-Power Summit Conference have encouraged peace advocates to intensify their struggle for the sacred and just cause. Numerous meetings have been held in cities and villages in France, Italy, Britain, and other countries, where peace fighters have formulated measures that can end the "Cold War." The "New York Herald Tribune" in the United States pointed out that "the desire for peace is now the strongest emotion in the United States." The enthusiastic reception of the Soviet agricultural delegation visiting the United States by American farmers proves that the American people are willing to strengthen friendly ties with the people of other countries, especially with the Soviet people.

The news that N. A. Bulganin and N. S. Khrushchev accepted the invitation of the British government to visit Britain next spring was heartily welcomed by the British people and the people of other countries. Businessmen, cultural and artistic workers, social and political activists in Western countries are increasingly actively advocating expanding cultural and economic ties between East and West.

There is no doubt that new and greater achievements will be made on the road to strengthening international cooperation if all those involved strive to achieve measures aimed at further easing the international situation.

As for the democratic camp countries, they have in these days confirmed their statements of hope for peace with new facts. Let us cite a concrete example. At the Geneva Conference, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union N. A. Bulganin pointed out when talking about the issue of disarmament, "If the four major powers currently agree to demobilize the military forces withdrawn from Austrian territory after the signing of the Austrian State Treaty and correspondingly reduce the number of armed forces, then the four major powers will have made a good start."

This proposal was not supported by the Western countries that had troops stationed on Austrian territory. Nevertheless, the Soviet government decided to implement the measures it proposed for its troops withdrawn from Austria, thereby setting an example for the remaining three countries. Soviet Defense Minister Zhukov has ordered that all Soviet troops stationed in Austria be withdrawn to Soviet territory before October 1, and that a corresponding number of soldiers be prematurely demobilized from the Soviet army.

The near future will show whether the governments of the United States, France, and Britain will also do so. We believe that international public opinion will welcome the three countries to take such steps, especially because the previously published news about the possible transfer of the American troops to be withdrawn from Austria to Italy has aroused great dissatisfaction and justifiable unease among the Italian people.

The new and important proposals put forward by Premier and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China Zhou Enlai at the National People's Congress meeting have been supported by world public opinion.

The Soviet people welcome these proposals, especially the proposal of the Government of the People's Republic of China that countries in Asia and the Pacific region, including the United States, sign a collective peace convention to replace the existing military blocs in this region. Soviet public opinion welcomes the following news: In order to strive to resolve the issue of liberating Taiwan in a peaceful manner, the Chinese government has expressed its willingness to negotiate with the local authorities in Taiwan to formulate corresponding specific steps. All these measures of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China provide concrete examples of how to practically implement a policy of peace and easing international tensions. Facts have proved that the people of all countries firmly support the policies of those governments and leaders who sincerely desire peace and strive to consolidate peace. The will of the people must be taken into account!

The strength of the fighters for peace has grown immeasurably, their organization and their confidence in the inevitable victory of their just cause have also been strengthened. When summing up the struggle to ease international tensions, the people of all countries can indeed be proud of the achievements they have made. However, it is dangerous to be satisfied with the achievements already made. Do not forget that the forces of aggression have not been crushed, they have only temporarily retreated, hiding in some places, and continuing to plot conspiracies. The issue of guaranteeing collective security in Europe has not yet been resolved, the arms race has not yet stopped, atomic weapons have not yet been banned, the testing and production of atomic weapons are still continuing, and the most important international issues, including the German issue, which is the most important for the cause of peace, as well as some issues in Asia and the Far East, have not yet been resolved.

The struggle to consolidate peace is the cause of the people of all countries in the world. The more organized, the more persevering, and the more determined the people of all countries in the world are in the great and sacred cause of consolidating world peace, the more successful this struggle will be.

### 争取和平的愿望是各国人民最热烈的愿望——苏联“真理报”社论

    争取和平的愿望是各国人民最热烈的愿望
    ——苏联“真理报”社论
    世界各国人民非常满意地看到他们多年来为巩固和平和国际安全而作的努力所获得的结果。他们不倦地争取和平的斗争获得了初步的成果：任何人也不能否认，国际紧张局势现在有了某种程度的缓和。
    七年前在一批先进的社会名流和文化界人士的倡议下诞生的和平运动，已经成长为一支强大的力量，政府和议会、政界人士和国家领导人都不能不顾及到这种力量。
    和平运动在消除战争威胁方面作了无可估计的贡献。它进行了这样一些最大的国际运动：如为斯德哥尔摩发出的关于禁止原子武器的宣言征集签名的运动（一九五○年）和为关于缔结五大国公约的宣言征集签名的运动（一九五一年），这两次运动受到十亿以上的人的拥护。和平运动还组织了争取用协商方式解决国际争端的全世界性运动（一九五三年）等。各国人民保卫和平的斗争在停止朝鲜和印度支那战争方面起了重大作用。
    六月间举行的世界和平大会强有力地表现出千百万人们保卫伟大的和平事业的不可摧毁的意志。这次会议明显地说明了：争取和平的愿望是世界各国人民最热烈的愿望。
    和平拥护者的要求是明确而具体的：放弃实力和军事集团的政策，停止扩充军备，制止原子战争的严重威胁。爱好和平的各国人民要求保障欧洲一切国家的安全，一切国家之间实行密切的经济和文化合作，把德国重新统一成为一个和平、民主和不参加任何军事联盟的国家，缓和远东的紧张局势以及和平解决远东迫切的国际问题。
    苏联、中华人民共和国、人民民主国家以及其他爱好和平的国家所执行的外交政策，符合各国人民的这些要求，并且受到了他们的坚决支持。各国人民争取和平的斗争使国际关系中的紧张局势有了某些缓和，并且创造了有利于解决悬而未决的国际问题的条件。
    七月间举行的日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的工作受到了世界各国人民的密切注意，这次会议是东西方国家关系中一个重要的转折点。四国政府首脑在这次会议的正式会议上以及非正式的交谈中建立了亲自接触，对国际局势中最重要的一些问题交换了意见。
    爱好和平的各国人民满意地看到，合作和互相谅解的精神是四国会议的主要特点。所有珍视和平和安全的人都欢迎日内瓦会议的积极结果，这次会议为政治制度和社会制度不同的国家间建立信任奠定了开端。
    十月间的四国外长会议将对日内瓦会议上讨论的问题作进一步的研究，各国人民坚决要求这次外长会议采取进一步的步骤来解决悬而未决的国际问题。
    四国政府首脑会议的结果鼓舞和平拥护者去加紧为神圣和正义的事业进行斗争。法国、意大利、英国和其他国家的城市和乡村中纷纷举行许许多多会议，和平战士们在会上拟订了能够结束“冷战”的措施。美国的“纽约先驱论坛报”指出，“争取和平的愿望现在在美国是最强烈的情绪。”正在访问美国的苏联农业代表团受到的美国农民的热情接待证明，美国人民愿意加强同其他国家人民的友好联系，特别是同苏联人民的友好联系。
    尼·亚·布尔加宁和尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫接受英国政府的邀请于明春访问英国的消息，受到英国人民以及其他各国人民衷心的欢迎。西方国家的商界人士、文化艺术工作者、社会和政治活动家日益积极地主张扩大东西方的文化和经济联系。
    无庸怀疑：在加强国际合作的道路上将达到新的、更加巨大的成就，如果与此有关的所有人士争取实现旨在进一步缓和国际局势的措施的话。
    至于民主阵营各国，它们在这些日子中以新的事实证实了它们的希望和平的言论。我们举一个具体的例子。在日内瓦会议上，苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁在谈到裁军问题时指出，“如果四大国目前就同意把在奥地利国家条约签订以后从奥地利领土上撤出的军事部队复员，并相应地缩减武装部队的数量，那末四大国就作了一个良好的开端。”
    这个建议没有得到那些在奥地利领土上驻扎军队的西方国家的支持。虽然如此，苏联政府还是决定对自己从奥地利撤出的军队执行它所建议的措施，从而为其余三个国家做个示范。苏联国防部长朱可夫已下令在十月一日以前把驻扎在奥地利的全部苏联军队撤回到苏联领土上来，并且把相应数目的军人从苏联军队中提前复员。
    最近的将来将表明：美国、法国和英国政府是否也这样做。我们认为，国际舆论将欢迎它们三国采取这样的步骤，特别是因为在这以前所发表的关于即将从奥地利撤出的美国军队可能调往意大利的消息引起了意大利人民的极大不满和应有的不安。
    中华人民共和国总理兼外交部长周恩来在全国人民代表大会会议上提出的新的重要的建议，得到了世界舆论的拥护。
    苏联人民欢迎这些建议，特别是中华人民共和国政府主张亚洲和太平洋地区的国家，包括美国在内，签订一个集体和平公约，以代替目前存在于这个地区的军事集团的建议。苏联舆论界欢迎下列这个消息：中国政府为了力求以和平方式来解决解放台湾问题，已经表示愿意同台湾的地方负责当局进行谈判，以制定相应的具体步骤。苏联和中华人民共和国的所有这些措施提供了具体的范例，说明应该怎样在实际上执行和平和缓和国际紧张局势的政策。事实证明，各国人民坚决拥护那些真诚地愿望和平和争取巩固和平的政府和领导人物的政策。人民的意志必须要加以考虑！
    争取和平的战士的力量不可计量地成长起来了，他们的组织性和他们对自己的正义事业必然胜利的信心也加强了。各国人民在总结争取缓和国际紧张局势的斗争时，的确可以为已经获得的成就而自豪。但是，满足于已有的成绩是危险的。不要忘记，侵略力量还没有被粉碎，它们只是暂时地退却了，在某些地方隐藏起来了，并且在继续制造阴谋。保障欧洲集体安全的问题还没有得到解决，军备竞赛还没有停止，原子武器还没有禁止，原子武器的试验和生产仍在继续中，最重要的国际问题、包括对于和平事业最重要的德国问题以及一些亚洲和远东问题还没有获得解决。
    争取巩固和平的斗争是世界各国人民的事业。世界各国人民在巩固世界和平的伟大和神圣的事业中越是有组织，越是有毅力和越是坚决，这个斗争也就越能获得成功。
