　　就建立两国外交、贸易和文化关系问题
　  苏联政府和西德政府再次交换照会
    新华社二十日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：苏联驻法国大使馆和德意志联邦共和国驻法国大使馆交换了两国政府关于举行会谈讨论建立外交、贸易和文化关系问题的照会。
    德意志联邦共和国政府在十二日给苏联政府的照会建议两国的会谈在一九五五年九月九日左右在莫斯科开始。
    照会说，考虑到苏联政府在一九五五年八月三日的照会中还建议讨论关于两国就建立外交关系交换文件的问题，以及缔结贸易条约和缔结文化协定的问题，联邦政府表示同意在会谈的过程中讨论为准备交换文件和缔结上述有关协定而需要采取的适当措施。
    照会表示，讨论关于建立外交、贸易和文化关系问题时必须讨论同苏联政府上述的问题有政治关系的其他问题。这包括德国国家统一问题，还包括释放现在被拘留在苏联领土或苏联势力范围内或是遭到其他障碍而不能离开上述地区或上述势力范围的德国人的问题。
    苏联政府十九日向德意志联邦共和国政府提出复照，表示同意在九月九日同以阿登纳总理为首的德意志联邦共和国政府代表团在莫斯科开始会谈。
    照会说：至于德意志联邦共和国政府照会中所提到的德国国家统一问题，苏联政府毫不怀疑地认为，德意志联邦共和国是知道苏联对这个问题的态度的。当然，苏联政府认为就这个问题以及双方所感兴趣的其他国际问题交换意见是不致于有什么障碍的。
