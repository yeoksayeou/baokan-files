The Increase Production and Practice Economy Work of Qianmucheng Yi Village Agricultural Cooperative
	Zhao Zonglai

	In Qianmucheng Yi Village, Yingchengzi District, Lüda City, there are seven agricultural production cooperatives, with member households accounting for 88% of the village's total households. These cooperatives mainly produce vegetables, while also engaging in field crops and fruit trees. Due to blind investment and the lack of a system for managing materials, these cooperatives experienced serious waste. According to statistics, the capital construction expenditure of five old cooperatives in 1954 totaled 78,715 yuan, exceeding 324% of the public accumulation fund of these cooperatives. Were these capital constructions all practically necessary? No, some could have been postponed, and some could have been reduced or avoided. For example, the Fifth Cooperative spent more than 2,300 yuan to dig an electric well in the spring of 1954, which was left idle for half a year. The Third Cooperative planned to spend 500 yuan to build three stables in 1954, but ended up spending more than 1,400 yuan to build four brick houses. Half of the flour milling equipment, worth more than 200 yuan, purchased by this cooperative was left unused. Although the unit area yield of these cooperatives has increased year by year, and the area of orchards has also continued to expand, blind investment in capital construction and serious waste in the use of commercial fertilizers have resulted in high debt, empty reserves, and low actual income for members. In 1954, when these cooperatives distributed profits, they generally only received about 30% of their due share, which had a very bad impact on the masses inside and outside the cooperatives.
	In response to this situation, under the unified leadership of the Party branch, these cooperatives carried out a campaign to increase production and practice economy to strive for over-fulfillment of production plans. All seven cooperatives held management committee and member congresses to expose and examine waste within the cooperatives. At the beginning of the exposure of waste, some members had concerns. Some believed that practicing economy meant tightening belts; some were afraid of exerting more effort and working harder; some knew that there was waste in the cooperatives, but dared not bring it up. The leading cadres of the cooperatives also had concerns. Some cooperative directors believed that they had already paid attention to economizing expenditures, and there was nothing more to economize; individual leading cadres of the cooperatives were also afraid that the masses would raise opinions and lower their prestige. These thoughts became obstacles to increasing production and practicing economy. The Party branch of this village, in light of the actual situation in each cooperative, repeatedly explained and clarified the importance of carrying out increased production and practicing economy for further consolidating and expanding the cooperative. At the same time, it required the leading cadres of the cooperatives to promote democracy and listen to the opinions of the cooperative members. In this way, the ideological concerns of the leading cadres and members of the cooperatives were gradually eliminated. Many cooperative members used their rest time during field production to hold meetings to expose waste and offer rationalization proposals. Members of the First Cooperative put forward a total of 64 constructive suggestions. Members of the Second Cooperative exposed the phenomenon of land waste after the vegetable garden trellises were removed in the past. Members of the Fifth Cooperative suggested that the corn stalks used for temporary windbreaks in the past were a pity to be used as firewood after being removed. If they were used as feed, more than 800 yuan could be saved. Han Hengping, a 65-year-old member of the Fifth Cooperative, after listening to the report of the cooperative director examining past waste, also suggested planting irises along the edges of the vegetable garden waterways and sesame on the edges of the land to increase production.
	Through exposing waste, everyone further tapped the potential for increased production. If the five old cooperatives could use the land rationally, they could plant more than 31,000 additional pumpkins and sunflowers, and at the same time, they could reclaim 59 mu of uncultivated and newly cultivated land (Northeast mu, the same below). Through mobilizing members to vigorously accumulate fertilizer, the five old cooperatives have accumulated more than 12,000 additional heaps of fertilizer, more than 4,000 heaps more than the same period last year. The topdressing of 24 mu of cucumbers in the Fifth Cooperative was originally planned to use night soil from the city. After research by the members, it was changed to using their own kang manure, which could reduce the cost by six yuan per mu, saving more than 140 yuan at once.
	Each cooperative has made many achievements in increasing production and saving expenditures. According to the statistics of the five old cooperatives as of May 20, although the land area has been expanded by 1,060 mu this year, the expenditure on purchasing commercial fertilizers was only more than 6,600 yuan, saving more than 8,200 yuan compared with the same period last year. Significant savings have also been made in the use of seeds and feed. According to preliminary estimates, the five old cooperatives can increase production and save about 30,000 yuan this year. The capital construction costs of these cooperatives have been reduced, and the production costs have also been lowered. Judging from the current plan, the capital construction expenditure of the five old cooperatives this year only accounts for 2.4% of the total income on average, which is a significant reduction compared with about 20% of the total income last year. In 1954, the actual production cost of the five old cooperatives accounted for about 40% of the total income on average, while this year it is generally about 30%.

    前牧城驿村农业合作社的增产节约工作
    赵宗来
    旅大市营城子区前牧城驿村有七个农业生产合作社，入社农户占全村总农户的百分之八十八。这些社都以蔬菜生产为主，兼营大田、果树。由于盲目投资和物资保管没有制度等，这些社曾发生严重的浪费现象。据统计，一九五四年五个老社的基本建设费共七万八千七百一十五元，超过了这些社所积累的公积金的百分之三百二十四。这些基本建设是不是都是切合实际需要的呢？不是的，有些是可缓办的，有些是可以少办或不办的。如第五社一九五四年春季用了二千三百多元打一眼电井闲了半年。第三社一九五四年计划用五百元盖三间马棚，结果花了一千四百多元盖了四间瓦房。这个社购置的价值二百多元的粉房用具，有半数闲着未用。这些社的单位面积产量虽然逐年提高，果园面积也不断扩大，但是由于盲目向基本建设投资和使用商品肥料等有严重浪费，使社负债多、底子空、社员实际收入低。一九五四年这些社分配收益时，一般只分得应分额的百分之三十左右，给社内社外群众带来很坏的影响。
    针对这一情况，这些社在党支部的统一领导下，进行了争取超额完成生产计划的增产节约工作。七个社都召开了管理委员会和社员大会，揭发和检查了社内的浪费现象。在开始揭发浪费时，有些社员产生了顾虑，有的认为节约就是扎脖颈、紧腰带；有的怕多出力，多干活；有的明知道社里有浪费现象，但不敢提出来。在社的领导骨干方面也有顾虑，有的社主任认为已经注意节约开支，再没啥可节约的了；个别社的领导骨干还怕群众提意见降低自己的威信。这些思想成了增产节约的障碍。这个村的党支部针对各个社内的实际情况，反复交代和说明开展增产节约对进一步巩固和扩大社的重要性，同时要求社的领导骨干发扬民主，倾听社员群众的意见，这样，社内领导骨干和社员的思想顾虑就逐渐消除了。很多社的社员都利用田间生产休息时间，开会揭发浪费和提合理化建议。第一社社员共提出了六十四条建设性意见。第二社社员揭发了过去菜园拔掉架子后浪费土地的现象。第五社社员提出：过去临时风障用的玉米秸，拔掉后做了烧柴很可惜，如果利用做饲料，可以节约八百多元。第五社六十五岁老社员韩恒平在听了社主任检查过去浪费的报告后，也提出菜园水道埂边上栽马莲，地边种芝麻的增产建议。
    大家通过揭发浪费，又进一步挖掘了增产潜力。五个老社如果能够合理使用土地就可以增种三万一千多棵倭瓜和向日葵，同时还可以开生熟荒地五十九亩（东北亩以下同）。经过发动社员大力积肥，五个老社已增积肥料一万二千多堆，比去年同时期多积四千多堆。第五社二十四亩黄瓜的追肥原计划用城市的大粪，经过社员研究后改用自己的炕粪，这样每亩可以降低成本六元，一次就节省了一百四十多元。
    各社在增加生产、节约开支上都有不少成绩。据五个老社五月二十日的统计，今年土地面积虽然扩大了一千零六十亩，但买商品肥料仅支出六千六百多元，比去年同一时期节约了八千二百多元。在使用种子、饲料等方面也都节约很多。据初步估计，五个老社今年可以增产节约三万元左右。这些社的基本建设费用削减了，生产成本也降低了。从现在的计划看，今年五个老社的基本建设费平均只占总收入的百分之二点四，比去年占总收入的百分之二十左右削减了很多。一九五四年五个老社实际生产费用占总收入的比重，一般是百分之四十左右，今年一般是百分之三十左右。
