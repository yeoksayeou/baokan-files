    Soviet Komsomol Central Committee Plenary Session Discusses the Resolutions of the July Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee
    The Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union held a plenary session on July 25 and 26 to discuss the resolution of the July Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union "On Tasks in Further Upswing of Industry, Technological Progress, and Improvement of Production Organization," and adopted a resolution on this matter.
    The resolution pointed out that the instructions of the July Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, regarding the need to enhance the role and initiative of Komsomol organizations in the production activities of enterprises, the need to fully support the valuable initiatives of Komsomol members and youth, and the need to more frequently care for the political education of young workers and improve their production skills, are a militant program for Komsomol work. Therefore, Komsomol organizations should strive to develop the interest of young workers and students of labor reserve schools in studying and mastering the scientific and technological achievements of the Soviet Union and foreign countries, and strive to support the suggestions made by young people to strive to master and adopt new technologies as quickly as possible, and help promote advanced production experience.
    The resolution stated that in the Komsomol organizations’ struggle for technological progress, raising the cultural and technical level of young workers should occupy an important position. Komsomol organizations should strive to increase the number of spare-time schools for general education, production technology training groups, training courses, and schools for advanced working methods, and improve their work.
