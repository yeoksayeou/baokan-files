    Correctly Implement the New Credit System for State-Owned Commerce

    Over the past few years, the credit work of state-owned commerce has played a certain role in ensuring the correct implementation of the state's commercial policies and the fulfillment of state tasks, as well as in guaranteeing the funds needed for the procurement of industrial and agricultural products. However, due to the relatively serious shortcomings in the implementation of economic accounting and business management, such as multiple links in commodity circulation, large losses, high costs, weak financial management, lax credit supervision, slow capital turnover, and the accumulation of some commodities for two or three years without being sold, a large amount of capital has been tied up, and the occupation of non-commodity funds has increased year by year, causing the growth rate of capital to exceed the growth rate of commodity turnover. The reasons for the above shortcomings, in addition to the shortcomings in the organizational work of the commercial system, are also mainly due to the imperfection of various systems. For example, there are shortcomings in financial management and credit systems. In addition, the implementation of contracts is not strict, and settlement discipline is very lax. Therefore, while strengthening planning work, improving wholesale business, and reducing commodity circulation links, the commercial sector must improve the credit system, accelerate capital turnover, and enable existing capital to play a greater role in commodity circulation.
    After several years of work, with the direct assistance and guidance of Soviet experts, the Ministry of Commerce and the Head Office of the People's Bank of China have initially formulated a new credit system for state-owned commerce. This system first changed the past method of controlling funds based on the difference between financial income and expenditure, clearly defined bank loans and own funds, and stipulated six types of loans according to different commodity circulation links: planned commodity reserves, over-planned commodity reserves, advance payments for purchases, settlements, special items, and major repairs, so as to ensure the capital needs of the commodity circulation plan, so that the issuance of loans is closely combined with commodity movement, thereby reflecting and supervising the implementation of the commodity circulation plan. Secondly, it stipulates that loans should be issued in a planned and purposeful manner, with a term and repayment on schedule, and with material guarantees, so as to change the past spontaneous state of credit control and give full play to the supervisory role of the bank. Thirdly, the new credit system requires the abolition of mutual arrears (i.e., commercial credit), so that state funds can be allocated and used in a planned manner, so as to save state funds and accelerate capital turnover. These provisions are all centered around the basic purpose of serving the continuous expansion and acceleration of commodity circulation, rationally using state funds, and ensuring the comprehensive completion of the state plan. Therefore, it is very different from the method of controlling loans based on the difference between financial income and expenditure. This system was piloted in the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company system in the fourth quarter of last year. The results of the pilot project proved that this system is feasible. It initially embodies the socialist credit principles of promoting the expansion and acceleration of commodity circulation, accelerating capital turnover, and saving state funds, strengthens the guarantee for the smooth completion of the commodity circulation plan, and improves planning management work. Therefore, on the basis of carefully summarizing the pilot project of the Coal Industry Building Materials Company, this system will continue to be promoted and expanded in the four company systems of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, Monopoly Company, Chemical Company, and Petroleum Company in the second half of this year.
    In order to smoothly promote the new credit system and make it better serve the expansion and acceleration of commodity circulation and the saving of state funds, this requires us to grasp the following principles and basic spirit in implementing the new credit system:
    First, loans must guarantee the capital needs of the commodity circulation plan approved by the state and serve the continuous expansion and acceleration of commodity circulation. The commodity circulation plan approved by the state specifically embodies the state-owned commerce's policies of serving production and consumption, implementing market management, transforming private merchants, stabilizing prices, and consolidating the currency. Therefore, guaranteeing the capital needs of the commodity circulation plan approved by the state is the main aspect of credit work in implementing state policies and fulfilling credit tasks.
    Second, while organizing the commodity circulation of the whole society and ensuring the supply of materials, state-owned commerce must also accumulate funds for socialist industrialization. Because the main sources of industrial and agricultural products are now controlled by the state, for materials in these sources that are in short supply, we are required to do a good job of timely allocation and distribution after purchasing, and quickly sell them to consumers, eliminating the phenomenon of accumulation here and out-of-stock there; for materials that are in oversupply, we are required to control purchases according to market needs and plans, and avoid blindly purchasing and blindly stimulating production. Only in this way can we save funds. Emphasizing saving funds will help promote more rational circulation of commodities. At the same time, state-owned commerce has widespread waste in the use of funds due to rapid development, many institutions, many personnel, complex work, and insufficient experience. Therefore, while establishing a system, we must strengthen the idea of saving funds from top to bottom. In accordance with this spirit, the new credit system stipulates that enterprises that do not act in accordance with the plan and waste state funds will be subject to necessary restrictions, which is beneficial to saving and rationally using state funds. Any one-sided emphasis on expanding and accelerating commodity circulation without paying attention to saving funds, or simply emphasizing saving funds while ignoring the expansion and acceleration of commodity circulation, is wrong.
    Third, loans must be issued in accordance with the actual implementation of the commodity circulation plan approved by the state, and the spirit of planned and purposeful issuance of loans and repayment on schedule must be implemented. Otherwise, the normal capital needs in the process of commodity circulation may not be met, affecting commodity circulation, and it may also form a spontaneous state of waste of state funds in which money is given whenever it is requested, and no questions are asked about repayment, which is detrimental to expanding and accelerating commodity circulation, ensuring capital needs, improving business management, and saving state funds.
    Fourth, loans needed by the state to control major agricultural products must be fully supplied and are not subject to plan restrictions. This is because cotton, oilseeds, etc. are very important materials in people's lives, and the output is basically still insufficient. Timely purchase can better meet people's needs and ensure market supply.
    Fifth, China has a vast territory and complex conditions. One method cannot solve all the problems in actual work. Therefore, we must be flexible in light of different local conditions on the premise of expanding and accelerating commodity circulation, accelerating capital turnover, and saving state funds, so as not to affect commodity circulation and waste state funds.
    The above five points are a unified and inseparable whole. Therefore, the study and implementation of the new credit system must be correctly, comprehensively, and completely understood and grasped. It is wrong to grasp one point in isolation and overemphasize it based on individual situations and certain clauses that suit one's own needs.
    In accordance with the above spirit, local banks and state-owned commercial departments must pay attention to the following points when implementing the new credit system:
    First, enterprises at all levels must prevent the tendency to isolate the expansion of commodity circulation and blindly expand commodity reserves, regardless of actual needs and possibilities, because this will inevitably lead to the neglect of the rational allocation of commodities and the use of state funds, and blindly increase purchases and stimulate blind production, resulting in commodity accumulation, which is not in line with the principle that commodities must be sold out after being purchased. We must prevent the tendency to think that arranging the market during the peak season is important, while neglecting accelerating capital turnover and strengthening financial management and credit supervision. At the same time, we must also prevent the tendency to simply emphasize saving funds and reduce purchases, which affects the expansion of commodity circulation. The correct attitude should be: continuously understand the needs of residents, carefully study the laws of purchase and sale, reasonably maintain commodity inventory, and quickly organize purchases and sales, so that the rational use of funds becomes a driving force for improving work.
    Second, banks at all levels must overcome the idea of ​​overemphasizing the planned nature and repayment of loans while neglecting the current actual situation, otherwise it may lead to over-tight and over-strict control of loans, which will affect the expansion and acceleration of commodity circulation. At the same time, we must also prevent the practice of giving money whenever it is requested without analyzing or studying any situation, otherwise it may cause some enterprises to uncontrollably purchase a large number of products that are not widely sold or are already accumulated, resulting in the accumulation of commodities and the waste of funds.
    Third, some units must overcome the "wide use with narrow planning" mentality that it doesn't matter if they use a little more. Units with this mentality deliberately make the income plan smaller and the expenditure plan deliberately larger, which violates the principle of correctly compiling the plan and is not allowed by national policy. Don't think that it doesn't matter if one unit wastes a little. If the capital turnover of state-owned commerce is slowed down by 0.1 times in 1955, it will waste more than 510 million yuan of state funds.
    Fourth, commercial credit (i.e., mutual arrears among departments) must be actively, resolutely, and cautiously abolished, because the existence of commercial credit weakens the correctness of the capital use plan, wastes state funds, disrupts the capital use plan, and is in opposition to the planned economy.
    Promoting the new credit system is a very arduous task. State-owned commercial and banking sectors in various regions must conscientiously study and implement the various provisions of the new credit system, correctly and comprehensively understand and grasp its basic spirit and principles, and ensure the capital needs of the commodity circulation plan approved by the state with a realistic attitude, and issue loans according to the actual implementation of the commodity circulation plan, so as to realize the expansion and acceleration of commodity circulation and strengthen the role of credit supervision. State-owned commerce should rationally use various loans to achieve accelerated capital turnover and save funds for the country's socialist industrialization.

    正确贯彻国营商业新的信贷制度
    中国人民银行商业信贷局局长　李绍禹
    商业部财务局副局长　陈实
    几年来，国营商业的信贷工作在保证正确执行国家商业政策和完成国家任务方面，在保证收购工农业产品所需要的资金方面，是起了一定作用的。但是由于在推行经济核算制和经营管理方面还有较为严重的缺点，如商品流转的环节多、损耗大、费用高，以及财务管理薄弱，信贷监督不严，资金周转缓慢，某些商品积压两、三年还卖不出去等，结果是搁死了大量资金，非商品资金的占压逐年增大，使资金增长的速度超过商品流转额增长的速度。产生以上缺点的原因，除商业系统的组织工作还有缺点以外，各种制度还不够完善也是主要原因之一。如财务管理和信贷制度就有缺点。另外，执行合同不严格，结算纪律又很松懈。因此，商业部门在加强计划工作、改进批发业务、减少商品流转环节的同时，必须改进信贷制度，加速资金周转，使现有资金在商品流转中发挥更大的效能。
    经过几年来的工作，在苏联专家的直接帮助和指导下，商业部和中国人民银行总行已初步制定了国营商业新的信贷制度。这个制度首先改变了过去按财务收支差额掌握资金的办法，明确划分了银行贷款和自有资金，同时按照不同的商品流转环节规定了计划商品储备、超计划商品储备、进货预付、结算、特种及大修理等六种放款，以保证商品流转计划的资金需要，使贷款的发放同商品运动密切结合，从而反映和监督商品流转计划的执行情况。其次规定了贷款要有计划、有目的地发放，要有期限和按期归还，以及要有物资保证等原则，以改变过去信贷掌握上的自流状态，充分发挥银行的监督作用。再次是新信贷制度要求取消相互拖欠（即商业信用），使国家资金有计划地分配和运用，以节约国家资金，加速资金周转。这些规定都是围绕着为不断扩大和加速商品流转服务，合理运用国家资金，保证国家计划的全面完成这一基本目的的。因此，它同按财务收支差额掌握贷款的办法有很大区别。这个制度已于去年四季度在中国煤业建筑器材公司系统试行，试行的结果证明这一制度是可行的，它初步体现了促进扩大和加速商品流转、加速资金周转和节约国家资金的社会主义信贷原则，加强了对商品流转计划顺利完成的保证作用，提高了计划管理工作。因此，在认真总结煤业建筑器材公司试点的基础上，这个制度今年下半年要在中国花纱布公司、专卖公司、化工公司、石油公司四个公司系统继续扩大推行。
    为了使新信贷制度顺利地推广并使其更好地为扩大和加速商品流转、节约国家资金服务，这就要求我们在实行新信贷制度中，掌握下列原则和基本精神：
    第一、贷款必须保证国家批准的商品流转计划的资金需要，为不断扩大和加速商品流转服务。国家批准的商品流转计划是具体体现国营商业为生产为消费服务、贯彻市场管理、对私商改造、稳定物价、巩固货币等政策的。因此，保证国家批准的商品流转计划的资金需要，便是信贷工作为执行国家政策、完成信贷任务的主要方面。
    第二、国营商业在组织全社会商品流转、保证物资供应的同时，还必须为社会主义工业化积累资金。因为现在工农业产品的主要货源已为国家所掌握，在这些货源中属于供不应求的物资要求我们在买进之后做好及时的调拨和分配，迅速销售到消费者手中，消除此处积压彼处脱销的现象；属于供过于求的物资则要求我们根据市场需要和计划对进货有所控制，避免盲目进货，盲目刺激生产。只有这样，才能节约资金。强调节约资金，就会帮助促进商品更加合理的流转。同时，国营商业由于发展快、机构多、人员多、工作复杂、经验不足，在资金使用上的浪费现象是普遍存在的。因此在建立制度的同时，必须从上到下地加强节约资金的思想。根据这个精神，在新的信贷制度中规定了对不按计划办事，浪费国家资金的企业予以必要的限制，这对节约和合理运用国家资金是有好处的。任何片面地强调扩大和加速商品流转，而不注意节约资金，或单纯地强调节约资金，而忽视扩大和加速商品流转的思想和作法都是错误的。
    第三、必须根据国家批准的商品流转计划的实际执行情况发放贷款，同时必须贯彻有计划、有目的的发放贷款和按期归还的精神。否则，就可能使商品流转过程中的正常资金需要不能得到满足，影响商品流转，也可能形成要钱就给、还不还不加过问的浪费国家资金的自流状态，这对扩大和加速商品流转，保证资金需要和改善经营管理，节约国家资金，都是不利的。
    第四、国家为掌握主要农产品所需要的贷款必须充分供应，不受计划限制。这是因为棉花、油料等是人民生活中十分重要的物资，目前产量基本上还是不足的，及时地购进才能够更好地满足人民需要，保证市场供应。
    第五、我国地区辽阔，情况复杂，一个办法不可能解决实际工作中的一切问题，因此，必须在扩大和加速商品流转、加速资金周转、节约国家资金的前提下，根据各地不同情况灵活掌握，才不致于影响商品流转和浪费国家资金。
    以上五点是统一而不可分割的一个整体。因此，对新信贷制度的学习和实行就必须是正确、全面、完整地领会和掌握，如果只是根据个别情况和适合自己需要的某些条文而孤立地抓住一点来过分强调，都是错误的。
    根据上述精神，各地银行和国营商业部门在执行新的信贷制度时，必须注意下列几点：
    第一、各级企业必须防止不顾实际需要和可能，孤立地强调扩大商品流转、盲目地扩大商品储备的偏向，因为这样就必然造成不顾商品的合理分配和节约国家资金的使用，而盲目增加进货、刺激盲目生产，造成商品积压，这是不符合把商品收购进来还必须销售出去的原则的。要防止认为旺季安排市场要紧，而忽视加速资金周转和加强财务管理及信贷监督的偏向。同时也必须防止单纯强调节约资金而减少进货，影响扩大商品流转的偏向。正确的态度应该是：不断地了解居民需要，仔细研究购销规律，合理保留商品库存，迅速地组织购进和推销，使合理使用资金成为提高工作的推动力量。
    第二、各级银行必须克服过于强调贷款的计划性和归还性，而忽视当前实际情况的思想，否则就可能产生贷款掌握上的过紧过严，而影响扩大和加速商品流转。同时也必须防止对任何情况不加分析、不加研究而要钱就给的作法，否则就可能使某些企业不加控制地大量收购销路不广或已有积压的产品，造成了商品的积压和资金的浪费。
    第三、某些单位必须克服认为自己多用一点没有关系的“宽打窄用”思想。有这种思想的单位把收入计划故意编小，支出计划故意编大，这是破坏正确编制计划的原则的，也是国家政策所不能允许的。不要认为一个单位浪费一点不要紧，如果国营商业一九五五年资金周转慢零点一次，就会浪费国家资金五亿一千多万元。
    第四、必须积极、坚决、慎重地取消商业信用
  （即各部门互相拖欠），因为商业信用的存在削弱了资金使用计划的正确性；浪费了国家资金，打乱资金使用计划，跟计划经济是互相对立的。
    推行新信贷制度，是一件十分艰巨的任务。各地国营商业和银行必须认真学习和执行新信贷制度的各项规定，正确地、全面地领会和掌握其基本精神和原则，以实事求是的态度保证国家批准的商品流转计划的资金需要，并按商品流转计划的实际执行情况发放贷款，以实现扩大和加速商品流转，加强信贷监督的作用。国营商业要合理地运用各种贷款，以达到加速资金周转，为国家的社会主义工业化节约资金。
