Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 1st: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" reported on July 31st: According to news from the Paris-published "Liberation," the United States is ordering 100 million US dollars worth of military supplies from Japan to arm the Ngo Dinh Diem army and the armies of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Kingdom of Laos.

The US order includes nearly 100,000 kilograms of gunpowder, 400,000 landmines, 500,000 rounds of artillery shells of various calibers, nearly 300,000 hand grenades, and a large number of rifle bullets. Japanese military industrial companies accepting the US orders include "Daido Steel," "Kobe Steel," "Osaka Metal Industries," and "Sasebo Shipbuilding Industry."

In addition, Toyo Aviation Industry Company of Japan will manufacture 25 aircraft to be handed over to Cambodia; Fuji Industries will supply the Ngo Dinh Diem regime with a batch of fighter jets. Other news reports also state that Mitsubishi Shipbuilding and Ishikawajima Heavy Industries will manufacture warships for the United States to be handed over to the Vietnamese authorities.

The "People's Daily" pointed out that it is obvious that US imperialism is openly providing weapons to the Ngo Dinh Diem regime and the governments of the Kingdoms of Cambodia and Laos in a conspiracy to turn South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos into US military bases in order to prepare for the re-creation of the Indochina War. This action seriously violates the Geneva Accords and the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference.

    美国向日本订购大批军火
    准备武装南越和柬埔寨、老挝王国军队
    新华社河内一日电　七月三十一日的越南“人民报”报道：据巴黎出版的“解放报”消息，美国正在向日本订购一亿美元的军火来武装吴庭艳军队和柬埔寨、老挝王国政府的军队。
    美国订购的有近十万公斤火药、四十万颗地雷、五十万发各种口径炮弹、近三十万枚手榴弹和大批步枪子弹。接受美国订货的有日本的“大同制钢”、“神户制钢”、“大阪金属工业”和“佐世保船舶工业”等军火公司。
    此外，日本的东洋航空工业公司将制造二十五架飞机交给柬埔寨；富士工业公司将供给吴庭艳政权一批战斗机。其他许多消息也报道，三菱造船公司和石川岛重工业公司将替美国制造军舰，交给越南当局。
    “人民报”指出，很显然，美帝国主义公开地援助吴庭艳政权和柬埔寨、老挝王国政府以武器，是阴谋将越南南方、柬埔寨和老挝变为美国的军事基地，以便准备重新制造印度支那战争。这一行动严重违反了日内瓦协定和日内瓦会议最后宣言。
