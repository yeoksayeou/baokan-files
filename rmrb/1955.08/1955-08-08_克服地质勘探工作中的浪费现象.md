　　Overcoming Waste in Geological Exploration Work
　　Liu Xiaotong Chen Tiesheng
　　In recent years, with the continuous development of economic construction, the geological exploration work of the Ministry of Heavy Industry system has gradually unfolded and achieved certain results. However, if we examine it according to the principle of practicing thrift and economy as indicated by the Central Government in its successive instructions, we can find that the waste phenomenon in the geological exploration work of the Ministry of Heavy Industry is very serious.
　　First, the quality of geological exploration work is low, rework is wasteful, and the submission of geological summary reports is delayed. The first rare metal mineral system is one of the key projects designed abroad. The state required the submission of a geological summary report in February 1955. However, due to the poor quality of geological work and insufficient geological data, rework was repeatedly carried out. The geological report was delayed from February to April and June, and it was not submitted until July, making it impossible for foreign countries to complete the design tasks on time, which affected the speed of key project construction. A clay mine has been explored since 1953. Due to the blindness and confusion in the exploration work, although 1.3 million yuan has been invested, the task has not been completed. This year, it has to be re-explored from the low-grade ore reserves. What is serious is that the exploration unit of this mine does not implement the instructions and suggestions of the Ministry, Bureau, and Soviet experts, and has not yet made a qualified exploration design, which has delayed the construction period. In the process of exploration, many units neglect to make full use of underground resources, and there are still independent operations such as exploring copper without iron and exploring lead without tin. The 101 Exploration Team only calculated the copper reserves in its work, and did not study the useful metals such as nickel, cobalt, and molybdenum well, and even the known iron reserves that meet industrial grades were not calculated together. The 304 Exploration Team only calculated copper, and did not calculate the sulfur reserves, which are as high as about 20%. The waste in mine exploration projects is also very serious. In 1954 and the first half of this year, a total of 137 boreholes were scrapped, resulting in a loss of about 8,700 meters of drilling. Calculated at an average of 90 yuan per meter, the total loss was 780,000 yuan. The main reasons for the abandonment of boreholes are backward construction management, violation of operating procedures, and frequent accidents in wells. From January to May this year, downtime accidents in drilling in various teams totaled more than 566,000 hours, which is equivalent to 100 drilling rigs not working for five months.
　　Second, the utilization rate of mechanical equipment is low. As of May, the utilization rate of diesel engines of the Shenyang Geological Exploration Company was only 40.1%, the utilization rate of electric motors of the North China Geological Exploration Company was 26%, and the utilization rate of drilling rigs of the Anshan Geological Exploration Company was 36.2%. What is particularly serious is that some units arbitrarily dismantle machines. This spring, the 302 Team dismantled a large number of new drilling rigs, diesel engines, water pumps, etc., allocated by the state and purchased from abroad. In the process of mechanical transportation, due to the lack of dedicated management, it is impossible to calculate how many parts were lost and damaged. Only the parts that were randomly dismantled on the pretext of production after being transported reached 544 pieces (or sets), resulting in 20 machines being incomplete, and 5 of them only had the base, with a loss of 95,000 yuan. The 303 Exploration Team has nine diesel generators, all of which are first-class equipment made in the Soviet Union. Due to the lack of maintenance and repair work, less than one year after being put into production, sixteen of the eighteen cylinder heads were broken. In addition, the middle part of the cylinder was damaged and the crankshaft was deformed, and only three to four units could be started frequently, resulting in a loss of more than 1,000 meters of tunnel excavation in the first quarter. Some units blindly apply for the purchase of equipment or materials. The air compressor capacity of the 302 Exploration Team can already meet this year's needs, but two more units were applied for in the plan, resulting in a backlog of 75,000 yuan in investment. The drilling team of the 104 Exploration Team wanted to purchase double sets of spare parts, and blindly copied a procurement plan from the product catalog. The supply section chief was afraid it would not be enough, and multiplied the number of varieties by two across the board. As a result, the pistons alone were enough for the entire team to use for six years. As of April this year, the team had a backlog of 500,000 yuan in equipment alone, accounting for about one-fifth of the total investment for the year.
　　Third, the organization is large, the number of personnel is large, and the phenomenon of work stoppage and idleness is common. Some units do not actively improve labor organization and operating methods, but blindly recruit personnel to expand the organization. From January to March, the units of the Geological Bureau system increased the number of formal employees by 2,636 and the number of fixed temporary workers by 2,531, resulting in bloated organizations and overstaffing in many units. In the first quarter of this year, the drilling workers of the 105 Team were idle for an average of 155 people per day, and the idle work expenses for the entire quarter reached 27,900 yuan, but they also hired temporary workers for 20,334 workdays, with a wage expenditure of about 30,000 yuan. The welfare section of the Anshan Geological Exploration Company alone has 125 people, and there are 12 civil servants in the dormitories with less than 10,000 square meters. The company itself has 7 correspondents and 7 car drivers. Although it has been reorganized once recently, this section still has 119 people. The Kunming Geological Exploration Company pays for surplus cadres on the one hand, and hires temporary workers on the other. In the 31 staff members of a certain branch of the 302 Team, there are 9 temporary workers. These phenomena have caused frequent waste.
　　Fourth, the indicators for non-production construction projects are high, the number is large, and the welfare facilities are extravagant and wasteful. The non-production construction projects of the geological exploration department must be simple and crude to suit its mobility characteristics. However, some units started large-scale construction as soon as the geological exploration work started, and built permanent offices, dormitories, auditoriums, etc. For example, the 304 Team built a lot of non-productive construction projects in the past when the resources were unclear. This year, under the cover of an auditorium and cafeteria (in fact, the team has a cafeteria and there are auditoriums nearby that can be borrowed), it built a large brick and wood structure auditorium. The 303 Team built a luxurious small building near the Kunming office without approval.
　　Why does such serious waste occur?
　　First, many staff members of the Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry lack the concept of economic accounting and the idea of cherishing national wealth. In recent years, in order to explore the underground resources of the motherland, the state has allocated a large amount of funds to the geological exploration system of the Ministry of Heavy Industry. When using these funds, we should naturally make careful calculations and strive to save money in order to maximize its effect, that is, to obtain the maximum amount of ore with the least investment; doing so is not only an economic issue, but also a serious political task. However, many comrades do not cherish funds, do not stop the waste of funds, spend money arbitrarily, only care about production and not costs, and only care about using investment and ignore the effect. Some staff members have serious supply system ideas, always thinking that the more stockpiled, the bigger the family fortune, and the better the days; some people even think that geological exploration work is complex and changeable, and it is inevitable to stockpile equipment and materials and waste part of the funds. These ideas are extremely wrong. In the past, the leading staff of the Geological Bureau failed to criticize the above-mentioned various wrong ideas, so that they failed to quickly eliminate the waste phenomenon, causing serious losses to the country.
　　Second, the idealism of some geological exploration staff is more serious. Geological exploration work is a comprehensive and complex scientific and technical work. We must treat various problems in practical work with a scientific attitude and a materialist viewpoint. However, some technicians often use subjective inference methods to solve various problems in their work. They do not go deep into the field to understand the situation with a pragmatic attitude, but listen to one-sided reports with an extremely irresponsible attitude, or draw arbitrary conclusions after seeing some local phenomena in the field. Under the control of this erroneous idea, serious technical errors and major economic losses were caused in geological work. In one mining area, due to the lack of careful investigation by geological personnel, the geological situation was wrongly reflected, and it was inferred that there was no hope in that place, but this year's work proved that it is a rare large mine in the country. In one mining area, due to the subjective use of the outdated bourgeois theory by geological personnel, it was believed that there would be no ore in dolomite, so they did not actively implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, and did not actively deploy workload in the dolomite area. As a result, more than 100 boreholes were drilled with very little ore. Based on this, it was believed that there was no hope in this mining area. Later, after the leadership insisted on implementing the experts' suggestions and carrying out the work, it proved that dolomite not only contains ore, but also is the main ore-finding mark in the mining area, which improved the prospect of the entire mining area.
　　Third, there is a lack of unified regulations and systems in geological work, and technical management is weak. The weakness of technical management is manifested in the lack of unified and clear technical regulations, the lack of effective methods and systems to ensure the implementation of existing regulations, the lack of technical education, and the lack of a clear responsibility system. Judging from the work situation in the first half of 1955, although the central task of strengthening technical management as the main content was deployed at the beginning of last year, requiring various units to strengthen technical leadership and improve the quality of geological work through the establishment of a chief engineer system, due to the insufficient understanding of the importance of improving geological work through technical management by various units, many units have not well implemented it so far, so that the chief engineer system has not been well established so far, resulting in weak technical leadership, either no one is responsible or there are multiple leaderships, and the geological work has not been organized reasonably, so that the existing system and regulations are reduced to formality. No one is held accountable when problems occur, good ones are rarely commended, and bad ones are not strictly criticized. As a result, the quality of various geological data is low, the phenomenon of delaying geological exploration design and geological summary reports has not been reversed, and the phenomenon of blindly carrying out construction in violation of the exploration procedures still exists.
　　In order to conscientiously implement the policy of practicing thrift and economy as instructed by the Central Committee and ensure the comprehensive and balanced completion of the geological exploration tasks in 1955, the Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, in addition to recently holding an exploration team leader meeting to further expose various waste phenomena and specifically deploy the savings tasks for the second half of the year, also conducted preliminary research and analysis of the current situation and believed that the potential in the current geological exploration work is still very large. After preliminary calculation, the entire bureau can save the country 10 million yuan in funds throughout the year. At present, all the staff of the Geological Bureau system of the Ministry of Heavy Industry are working hard to complete this task.

    克服地质勘探工作中的浪费现象
    刘晓彤　陈铁生
    几年来随着经济建设的不断发展，重工业部系统的地质勘探工作也逐步展开，并取得了一定的成绩。但是，如果根据中央历次所指示的厉行节约的原则加以检查，则可以发现重工业部地质勘探工作中的浪费现象是十分严重的。
    第一，地质勘探工作质量低劣，返工浪费大，拖延提交地质总结报告时间。第一稀有金属矿系国外设计的重点工程之一，国家要求一九五五年二月提出地质总结报告，但由于地质工作质量低劣，地质资料不足，一再返工，把地质报告自二月拖到四月、六月，直到七月份才交出，使国外不能按时完成设计任务，影响重点工程建设的速度。有一个粘土矿自一九五三年开始勘探，由于勘探工作上的盲目和混乱，虽投入了一百三十万元仍未完成任务，今年不得不重新从低级矿量勘探。严重的是这个矿的勘探单位不执行部、局及苏联专家的指示和建议，直到现在尚未做出合乎要求的勘探设计，拖延了工期。在勘探过程中，许多单位忽视充分利用地下资源，仍有探铜不管铁、探铅不管锡的单干现象。一○一勘探队在工作中只计算了铜的储量，不但对镍、钴、钼等有用金属未很好研究，就连已知道的够工业品位的铁的储量也没有一并计算出来。三○四勘探队只计算了铜，对高达百分之二十左右的硫的储量也没有计算。在探矿工程方面的浪费同样很严重。一九五四年和今年上半年共报废钻孔一百三十七个，约损失钻探八千七百公尺，以每公尺平均九十元计算，共损失七十八万元。钻孔报废的主要原因是施工管理落后、违反操作规程和不断发生井内事故。今年一至五月份各队钻探停工事故达五十六万六千多小时，相当于一百台钻机五个月没有工作。
    第二，机械设备利用率低。截至五月份止，沈阳地质勘探公司柴油机利用率仅达百分之四十点一，华北地质勘探公司电动机利用率为百分之二十六，鞍山地质勘探公司钻机利用率为百分之三十六点二。尤其严重的是有些单位任意拆毁机器。三○二队今春将国家调拨的新从国外购来的钻机、柴油机、水泵等大量拆毁。在机械运输过程中，由于无专人管理，究竟丢失和损坏了多少机件已无法计算，只是在运到后借口生产胡乱拆走的机件即达五百四十四件（或套），致使二十台机器已残缺不全，有五台只剩了底座，损失达九万五千元。三○三勘探队有九台柴油发电机，都是苏联制造的头等装备，由于缺乏维护检修工作，投入生产后运转不到一年，十八个汽缸盖就破裂了十六个，加之汽缸中部损坏和曲轴变型，经常只能开动三至四台，在第一季度即损失坑探进尺一千公尺以上。有些单位盲目申请购置设备或器材。三○二勘探队的空气压缩机能力已能够满足今年的需要，但在计划中又申请了二台，积压投资七万五千元。一○四勘探队钻探分队要购置双套备件，盲目照产品目录抄了一份采购计划，供应科长还怕不够，一律把品种数乘上二，结果只活塞一项就足够全队使用六年，该队到今年四月份止，单设备一项即积压五十万元，占全年投资的五分之一左右。
    第三，机构大，人员多，停工、窝工现象普遍。部分单位不积极改善劳动组织，不改进操作方法，而只是盲目地招收人员扩大组织。一至三月份地质局系统各单位就增加了正式职工二千六百三十六人，固定性的临时工二千五百三十一人，致使很多单位机构臃肿，人浮于事。一○五队钻探工人今年第一季度平均每日窝工一百五十五人，全季窝工费达二万七千九百元，但又雇用临时工作了二万零三百三十四工作日，支出工资约三万元左右。鞍山地质勘探公司仅福利科即拥有一百二十五人，不足一万平方公尺的宿舍有十二个公务员，公司本身就有七个通讯员、七个汽车司机，最近虽然整编了一次，但这个科仍有一百十九人。昆明地质勘探公司一面开支编余干部费，一面还雇用临时工作人员，仅三○二队某分队的三十一名工作人员中，就有九名是临时工作人员。这些现象，造成了经常性的浪费。
    第四，非生产建筑工程指标高，数量多，福利设施铺张浪费。地质勘探部门的非生产建筑工程，必须从陋就简以适合其流动性的特点。但是，部分单位在地质勘探工作刚刚开始不久，便大兴土木，建设起了永久性的办公室、宿舍、礼堂等。例如三○四队过去在资源不清的情况下，就修了很多非生产性建筑工程，今年又在礼堂兼食堂的掩护下（实际该队有食堂，附近也有可借用的礼堂）又盖了一栋砖木结构的大礼堂。三○三队未经批准即在昆明办事处附近新建了一所华丽的小楼房。
    为什么会发生这样严重的浪费现象呢？
    首先，因为重工业部地质局的不少工作人员缺乏经济核算思想和爱护国家财富的观念。几年来，国家为了勘探祖国的地下资源，给重工业部地质勘探系统拨出了大量资金。在使用这些资金时自然应该精打细算、努力节约，以发挥它的最大效果，也就是要以最少的投资获得最多的矿量；这样做不单纯是经济问题，而且是一项严肃的政治任务。但是，许多同志对资金不加爱惜，对浪费资金的现象不加制止，大手大脚任意开支，只管生产不顾成本，只管使用投资忽视效果。有些工作人员有严重的供给制思想，总认为积压越多家底越大，日子越好过；更有的人认为地质勘探工作复杂、变化大，积压设备材料和浪费一部分资金是不可避免的。这些思想都是极端错误的。由于过去地质局领导工作人员未能对上述各种错误思想加以批判，以致未能迅速消除浪费现象，给国家造成了严重的损失。
    其次，因为若干地质勘探工作人员的唯心主义思想比较严重。地质勘探工作是一门综合的、复杂的科学技术工作，必须用科学的态度、唯物的观点对待实际工作中的各种问题。但有些技术人员在工作中常以主观推断的方法解决各种问题，他们不是以实事求是的态度深入现场了解情况，而是以极不负责的态度来听取片面的汇报，或到现场走马观花地看到了些局部现象就武断地下结论。在这种错误思想支配下，造成地质工作中严重的技术错误，造成经济上的重大损失。有一个矿区由于地质人员调查不认真，错误地反映了地质情况，即推断那地方没有什么希望，但经过今年工作证明，那里是全国少有的大矿山。有一个矿区由于地质人员主观地搬用资产阶级陈旧的理论，认为在白云岩内不会含矿，因而就不积极执行苏联专家的建议，就不去在白云岩区积极地布置工作量，结果打了一百多个钻孔很少见矿，据此就认为这个矿区没有希望了。后经领导上坚持执行专家建议进行工作后，证明了白云岩内不仅含矿，而且是该矿区主要找矿标志，使整个矿区的前途又好转了。
    再次，因为地质工作中缺乏统一的规程、制度，技术管理薄弱。技术管理薄弱表现在缺乏统一而明确的技术规程，对已有的规程缺乏保证贯彻的有效方法和制度，缺乏技术教育，缺乏明确的责任制等方面。从一九五五年上半年的工作情况来看，虽然去年年初布置了以加强技术管理为主要内容的中心工作，要求各单位通过建立总工程师制度来加强技术领导，提高地质工作质量，但由于各单位对通过技术管理来改进地质工作的重要意义认识不足，迄今很多单位都没有很好贯彻执行，以致总工程师制度至今没有很好建立起来，造成技术领导薄弱，不是无人负责即是多头领导，没有合理地将地质工作组织起来，因而使已有的制度和规程流于形式。发生了问题也无人追究，好的也很少表扬，坏的也不严格地批评，结果是各种地质资料质量低劣，拖延地质勘探设计和地质总结报告时间的现象仍未扭转，违反勘探程序盲目施工现象依然存在。
    为了认真贯彻中央指示的厉行节约的方针，保证全面均衡地完成一九五五年的地质勘探任务，重工业部地质局除最近召开了勘探队长会议，进一步揭发各种浪费现象，具体布置下半年的节约任务外，同时初步研究分析了当前情况，认为目前地质勘探工作中的潜力还很大，经初步核算，全局全年可为国家节约资金一千万元。目前，重工业部地质局系统的全体职工正在为完成这个任务而努力。
