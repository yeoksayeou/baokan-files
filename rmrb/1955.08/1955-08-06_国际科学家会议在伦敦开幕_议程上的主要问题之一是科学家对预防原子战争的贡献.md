Xinhua News Agency, London, August 5th: According to TASS, the international scientists conference initiated by the "Association of Parliamentarians for World Government" opened in London on the 3rd. A key item on the conference's agenda is the contribution of scientists to the cause of preventing atomic war.

Davis, a British Member of Parliament and president of the Association of Parliamentarians for World Government, delivered the opening speech, expressing satisfaction with the participation of scientists from twenty-four countries. Davis especially welcomed the Soviet scientist delegation headed by Academician Topchiev to the conference, saying that the participation of Soviet scientists had transformed a conference of scientists from half the world into a conference of scientists from the entire world.

Speaking about the conference's tasks, Davis said that hydrogen bomb tests demonstrated the danger of this destructive power to humanity. Through discussions and the work of the conference's various committees, scientists will be able to accurately understand the nature of the catastrophe that could destroy humanity and the happiness that the latest inventions could bring.

British scientist Russell delivered a long report at the meeting, saying that scientists should make the public aware of the truth about the consequences of using atomic weapons as widely as possible, mainly to make the politicians who decide policy aware, but also the general public whose opinions politicians must heed. Russell hoped that this conference would be a beginning in this direction.

Russell pointed out that ideological conflicts should not be resolved by force. He said that the task of scientists is to persuade all mankind to believe this point and not let war break out.

Russell then talked about using scientific achievements to benefit all mankind. He said: "If the vast amount of knowledge and national property now used in preparing for slaughter were used to secure and improve life, then it is hard to predict what achievements would be made."

Russell submitted a proposal to the conference for discussion, which requested that governments around the world openly acknowledge that their goals cannot be achieved by launching a world war. The proposal stated, "Therefore, we call for an immediate study of the relationship of recent scientific developments to all of humanity and the promotion of peaceful solutions to all international disputes."

Discussion began after Russell finished speaking.

    国际科学家会议在伦敦开幕
    议程上的主要问题之一是科学家对预防原子战争的贡献
    新华社五日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：“争取建立世界政府各国议员协会”倡议召开的国际科学家会议三日在伦敦开幕，会议议程上的主要问题之一是科学家对预防原子战争的事业的贡献。
    争取建立世界政府各国议员协会会长、英国议员戴维斯致开幕词，他对世界二十四个国家的科学家参加会议表示满意。戴维斯特别表示欢迎以托普切夫院士为首的苏联科学家代表团参加这次会议，他说，苏联科学家的参加，把半个世界的科学家会议变成了全世界科学家的会议。
    戴维斯在谈到会议的任务时说，氢弹试验说明了这种破坏力量对人类的危险。在会议进行的讨论和会议各委员会的工作中，科学家将可能确切了解可能毁灭人类的灾难的性质和最新发明可能带来的幸福。
    英国科学家罗素在会上作了长篇报告，他说，科学家应该尽可能广泛地使公众知道使用原子武器的后果的真相，主要是使那些决定政策的政治家知道，也要使政治家必须倾听其意见的广大公众知道。罗素希望这次会议是走向这一方面的一个开端。
    罗素指出，思想上的冲突不应该用武力来解决。他说，科学家的任务就是要说服全人类相信这一点，而不让战争爆发。
    罗素然后谈到利用科学成就为全人类造福的问题。他说：“如果把现在用在准备屠杀方面的大量知识和国家财产用来保障和改善生活，那末谁也难预言将会取得怎样的成就。”
    罗素提出一项提案交大会讨论，提案要求世界各国政府公开地承认，它们的目的不能用发动世界大战的办法来达到。提案说，“因此，我们要求立即研究最近的科学发展对整个人类的关系和促进用和平办法解决一切国际争端。”
    罗素发言完毕后开始讨论。
