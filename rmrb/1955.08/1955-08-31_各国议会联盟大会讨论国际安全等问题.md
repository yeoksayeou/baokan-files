Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki:

　　The 44th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference continued its discussion on the question of international security and disarmament on August 29th.

　　West German representative Ehler, in his speech, advocated the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction and the implementation of a strict supervisory system.

　　Soviet representative Pankratova said in her speech that the Soviet delegation considered the draft resolution on the issue of collective security to be basically acceptable and would vote in favor of the draft resolution.

　　The Soviet Union has long striven to establish a European collective security system through treaties of mutual assistance for all of Europe, disarmament agreements, and other measures. The Soviet Union believes that the basis of the proposition of collective security is: not to allow the establishment of mutually hostile blocs, but to establish a collective security system that includes all countries (regardless of size).

　　The Soviet representative said that the Union should respond to the call of the people of all countries for peaceful coexistence among nations.

　　British representative Berenger and American representative Flanders spoke in defense of the arms expansion of the United States and Britain.

　　Albanian representative Bahori said that the Albanian people advocate a complete ban on atomic and hydrogen weapons. Albania believes that a European collective security system is the best way to prevent the outbreak of war in Europe.

　　British representative White emphasized that the road to peaceful coexistence is very rugged. Heads of government of all countries should strive to prevent ideological differences from leading to conflict.

　　Polish representative Lubienski advocated stopping arms expansion and gradually reducing armaments.

　　Representatives from India, Sudan, Ceylon, and other countries also spoke in the discussion.

　　Next, a vote was taken on the draft resolution on the legal and moral principles of coexistence that had been discussed previously. The amended draft resolution was adopted.

　　Finally, the meeting began to discuss strengthening the Inter-Parliamentary Union. British representative K. Davies gave a report. In his report, he welcomed the Soviet Union's participation in the Inter-Parliamentary Union. He said that mutual visits by parliamentary delegations and the expansion of personal contacts between parliamentarians must be increased. He pointed out the good role of the declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

　　This issue will continue to be discussed on August 30.

　　各国议会联盟大会讨论国际安全等问题
    新华社三十日讯　据塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：各国议会联盟第四十四届大会八月二十九日继续讨论关于国际安全和裁军的问题。
    德意志联邦共和国代表埃勒在发言中主张禁止大规模毁灭性武器，实行严格的监督制度。
    苏联代表潘克拉托娃发言说，苏联代表团认为关于集体安全问题的决议草案基本上是可以接受的，并且将投票赞成这个决议草案。
    苏联早就竭力谋求通过全欧互助条约、裁军协定和其他措施来建立欧洲集体安全体系。苏联认为，集体安全的主张的基础是：不容许建立互相敌对的集团，而应当建立包括一切国家（不分大小）在内的集体安全体系。
    苏联代表说，联盟应该响应各国人民要求各国和平共处的呼声。
    英国代表贝伦格和美国代表弗兰德斯发言为美国和英国的扩充军备辩解。
    阿尔巴尼亚代表巴霍里说，阿尔巴尼亚人民主张完全禁止原子武器和氢武器。阿尔巴尼亚认为，欧洲集体安全体系是防止在欧洲爆发战争的最好办法。
    英国代表怀特着重指出，和平共处的道路是十分崎岖的。各国政府首脑应该努力使思想意识上的不同不致引起冲突。
    波兰代表卢布利梁斯基主张停止扩充军备，并且逐步裁减军备。
    在讨论中发言的还有印度、苏丹、锡兰等国代表。
    接着就以前所讨论过的关于共处的法律和道义原则的决议草案进行表决。修正后的决议草案获得通过。
    会议最后开始讨论加强各国议会联盟的问题。英国代表克·戴维斯作了报告。他在报告中表示欢迎苏联参加各国议会联盟。他说，必须增加各国议会代表团的互相访问和扩大议员间的个人接触。他指出了苏联最高苏维埃宣言的良好作用。
    八月三十日将继续讨论这个问题。
