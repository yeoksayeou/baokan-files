Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, August 25th: According to reliable sources, at its meeting on the 24th, the Executive Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, under U.S. coercion, and in the absence of the Lebanese member and without the Chairman participating in the vote, decided by a vote of three to two to postpone discussion of the application of the People's Republic of China's delegation to join the Union, thereby effectively denying the legitimate right of representatives of the Chinese National People's Congress to participate in this inter-parliamentary organization. The Executive Committee is composed of members from seven countries. The members from the United States, Thailand, Turkey, Sweden, and Switzerland participated in the vote. The British Chairman of the Executive Committee did not participate in the vote, and the Lebanese member was absent.

The Executive Committee held consecutive meetings on the 23rd and 24th to discuss the participation of parliamentary groups from the Soviet Union, China, and other countries in the Inter-Parliamentary Union. However, at the Union Council meeting on the 24th, the Executive Committee merely announced to the Council that the Executive Committee had approved the admission of parliamentary groups from the Soviet Union, Albania, and Liberia to the Union, and also allowed Franco's Spain to replace the Spanish Republic as an original member of the Union. Regarding the application of the Chinese People's Delegation, it deliberately remained silent. This practice of the Executive Committee aroused questions and dissatisfaction from some members of the Union Council.

According to the Associated Press on the 24th, at the Executive Committee meeting, U.S. representative Cooley insisted on opposing the participation of the People's Republic of China in the Union, "Thai representative Nides supported Cooley," and representatives from Turkey, Switzerland, Sweden, and Lebanon "expressed support" for China's participation.

According to the "New Finland" newspaper on the 25th, the reason for the delay in China's application is that the U.S. representative announced at the Executive Committee meeting that "if Beijing China is allowed to become a member of the Union, they will withdraw from the meeting." According to well-informed sources, at the Executive Committee meeting, because the U.S. insistence on opposing China's opinion did not receive majority support, the U.S. representative even threatened to stop paying membership dues and withdraw from the Union together with their "friends" in order to obstruct China's participation.

Public opinion here and participants in the Union's routine meeting pointed out that this decision of the Union's Executive Committee not only violates the purpose of the Union's charter to promote international peace and cooperation, but also contradicts the spirit of promoting peaceful coexistence among countries with different political and social systems, which is the main agenda of this routine meeting of the Union. No one can deny that the Chinese People's Delegation fully meets the conditions stipulated in the Union's charter for national parliamentary groups as member bodies. Therefore, delaying the participation of the Chinese People's Delegation is an action that groundlessly obliterates the rights of 600 million Chinese people.

　　各国议会联盟执行委员会会议在美国胁持下
　　竟延期讨论我人民代表团参加联盟的申请
    新华社赫尔辛基二十五日电　据可靠方面消息，各国议会联盟执行委员会在二十四日会议上在美国胁持下，在黎巴嫩委员缺席和主席没有参加投票的情况下，以三票对两票决定延期讨论中华人民共和国人民代表团参加联盟的申请，从而在实际上否认了中国人民代表大会的代表参加这一个各国间议会组织的正当权利。执行委员会由七国的委员组成。参加投票的有美国、泰国、土耳其、瑞典和瑞士委员。执行委员会英国主席未参加投票，黎巴嫩委员缺席。
    执行委员会在二十三日和二十四日两天连续举行会议讨论苏联、中国等国的议员团参加各国议会联盟的问题，但是在联盟理事会二十四日的会议上，执行委员会仅仅向理事会宣布执行委员会已经通过接受苏联、阿尔巴尼亚、利比里亚的议员团参加联盟，同时并且允许佛朗哥西班牙取代西班牙共和国在联盟中的原有会员地位，而对中国人民代表团的申请，却故意只字不提。执行委员会这种作法，引起了一些联盟理事的质问和不满。
    据合众社在二十四日透露，在执行委员会上，美国代表库莱坚持反对中华人民共和国参加联盟，“泰国代表尼德斯支持库莱”，土耳其、瑞士、瑞典和黎巴嫩代表则“表示赞成”让中国参加。
    据“新芬兰报”二十五日透露，中国的申请之所以遭到拖延，是由于美国代表在执行委员会上宣布“如果北京中国被允许成为联盟的会员，他们就要退出会议”。又据消息灵通人士透露，在执行委员会会议上，由于美国坚持反对中国的意见并未得到多数的支持，美国代表竟以停止出会费和同他们的“朋友”一道退出联盟为要挟来阻挠中国的参加。
    此间舆论和联盟例会的与会人士指出，联盟执行委员会的这一决定，不仅违背了联盟章程所规定促进国际和平和合作的宗旨，而且是和联盟这次例会的主要议程的促进政治和社会制度不同的国家和平共处的精神相违背的。任何人也不能否认，中国人民代表团完全符合联盟章程所规定的作为会员团体的全国性的议员团的条件。因此，拖延中国人民代表团的参加是毫无理由的抹煞六亿中国人民权利的行动。
