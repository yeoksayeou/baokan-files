Establishing a Group Savings Account is a Good Way to Reduce Costs
Li Yinchu, Director of Tianjin No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory

Our factory now has 53 groups that have established group savings accounts. Through the establishment of group savings accounts, the entire factory has begun to establish a culture of frugality, and production costs have been significantly reduced. This has laid a good foundation for the comprehensive implementation of the economic accounting system.

The group savings account starts with the finance department designing a group savings notice, which is issued to each workshop and each group. The group records the facts of savings and waste on the notice at any time and sends it to the finance department. The finance department calculates the savings value based on the notice and prepares a voucher. After the workshop director verifies that it is true, it is recorded in the finance department's group savings account and the group's savings booklet, as a basis for summarizing monthly savings achievements.

Before July 1954, when the group savings account was established, waste in our factory was very serious. For example, due to the unfixed variety of printed patterns, the consumption of printing paste was different. When adjusting the color, in order to avoid delaying production, we always mixed more. Some color pastes changed color due to being stored for too long and had to be discarded. Workers in the mercerizing section of the bleaching workshop were unwilling to use recycled lye; there were often a lot of black coal coke in the coal ash burned in the boiler room; workers in the flat washing workshop did not turn off the power after the dryer finished working once, causing the machine to run idle all night; a probationary technician in the mechanical workshop was careless and made a mistake in drawing the large iron roller of the printing machine, resulting in a loss of more than 400 yuan at one time.

Waste in workshop funds and enterprise management fees was also large. When making budgets, various departments and groups made them broadly and loosely, wanting more, better, and more complete. The materials received were not managed, arbitrarily lost, and bought again when lost. If approval was not given, they said it would "affect production."

We had no idea how much waste these phenomena caused or how much impact they had on the completion of the cost plan.

How can every department and every group practice thrift and overcome waste? Last year, I participated in the economic activity analysis training class held by the Industry Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet "personal savings account." After returning to the factory, I discussed it with accounting personnel and decided to first establish group savings accounts in our factory based on current conditions. In July 1954, we began to pilot the establishment of the first group savings account in the electrician group. At that time, because we had no experience, we saved electrical wires when we saw waste, and reduced the parts budget when we saw waste of parts; but because there was no quota as a basis, the value of savings could not be calculated. The first pilot failed.

We felt that there must be a quota to calculate the savings. Then we established a savings account in the boiler group. After research and mobilizing workers to discuss, we formulated a quota for the boiler group to burn 6 tons of water into steam with one ton of coal. If less coal was used to boil water and more gas was evaporated, it would be counted as the group's savings. In this way, the group workers felt that they had a direction to work towards. Everyone put forward the slogan of "use less coal and produce more steam" and worked hard to improve operations. In the first month of implementing the group savings account, more than 4,000 yuan was saved. In August, the group workers took the initiative to propose revising the quota to burn 6.5 tons of water into steam with one ton of coal. After the quota was raised, more than 1,700 yuan was saved in August.

Based on the experience of the boiler group, we also reorganized the electrician group's savings account. Starting from grasping the key to saving electricity, we set the quota for the electrician group, stipulating the power, reactive power consumption, and maximum demand; at the same time, we checked the factory's power consumption, focusing on the air pump room and printing machine, which consumed the most electricity in the factory, and stipulated the average daily power consumption of this section, as a basis for calculating savings in the future. Subsequently, the group savings account was extended to twelve groups. In addition to using different quotas as a basis for reducing consumption, various groups also came up with many ways to save budget expenses and use substitutes. By the end of 1954, sixteen groups had established group savings accounts, saving the state more than 16,000 yuan in the second half of last year.

This year, when discussing the national plan, we included the comprehensive promotion of group savings accounts and the establishment of workshop cost accounting in key workshops as important tasks for the whole year. We mobilized employees to revise the group quotas for the first quarter, mobilized groups that had not yet implemented group savings accounts to discuss and formulate group quotas, and universally promoted group savings accounts. Now, various functional departments in the factory have also established group savings accounts.

In conjunction with the promotion of group savings accounts, some other savings systems have been established in the factory, which have played a good supporting role. Since we implemented the group savings account, we have gained the following points:

1. All employees in the factory have established a concept of thrift, launched regular savings activities, and reduced costs. We have a reliable mass base for ensuring the completion and over-completion of the national plan, especially the completion of the cost plan. From January to June this year, according to the savings figures on the group savings account, not only were more than 170,000 yuan saved, but the average monthly cost reduction for six months was more than 16%, of which May saw a reduction of 21%. Workshop funds and enterprise management fees have also been greatly reduced. For example, enterprise management fees in March, April, and May this year were reduced by an average of more than 4,000 yuan per month compared to the plan.

2. Quality is guaranteed. The completion of quality indicators from January to June this year was better month by month. In January, six of the eight products did not complete the quality plan. In February, five of the six products completed the quality plan. From March onwards, the quality plan has been fully over-completed every month.

3. The sense of ownership of the employees has been strengthened, and the role of supervising production has been brought into play. For example, through the establishment of group savings accounts, the electrician group has mastered the electricity consumption of the entire factory, proactively compiling statistics and investigating electricity consumption every day, and supervising the rational use of electricity in key electricity consumption departments such as the air pump room and printing room, preventing them from running idle. The boiler group often studies how to increase the calorific value of coal and how to ensure that the boiler is not damaged and more steam is evaporated. After the mercerizing machine group implemented the group savings account, the workers felt that using pure water to wash the car in the past, and the waste water flowing into the alkali pool, would dilute the concentration of the waste alkali liquor, wasting coal and man-hours when recovering caustic soda, so they changed to using waste alkali liquor with a lower concentration to wash the car. In the past, waste machine parts were thrown in the yard for a long time and no one managed them. Now, the workers in the maintenance and repair department have proactively sorted and stored them, and tried to use the usable parts as much as possible.

4. Through the establishment of group savings accounts, the idea of comprehensively completing the plan has also been established. In the past, some people in our factory said: To ensure quality, we cannot consider consumption. Now there is no such statement. Everyone has realized that it is entirely possible to comprehensively complete the various national plan indicators.

In addition, through the promotion of group savings accounts, problems in production can also be reflected in a timely manner. For example, in August 1954, the boiler workshop completed the quota, but the actual coal consumption was higher than in July. If we only looked at the numbers, we should have thought about how to reduce coal consumption from the boiler. After analyzing the group savings account, it was proved that there was waste in the workshop that used gas, and there were problems with production scheduling, which made us realize that we should improve the work in the gas-using workshop.

The role and achievements of establishing group savings accounts in reducing costs are very significant. We will definitely work hard to overcome the existing shortcomings and further consolidate mass-based savings work.

    建立小组节约账是降低成本的好办法
    天津市第一印染厂厂长  李寅初
    我们工厂里现在共有五十三个小组建立了小组节约账。通过小组节约账的建立，全厂开始树立了节约的风气，生产成本显著地降低了，这给全面实行经济核算制打下了良好的基础。
    小组节约账是先由财务科设计了小组节约通知单，发给各车间各小组。小组随时把节约和浪费的事实记在通知单上送给财务科，财务科根据通知单计算出节约价值并制出传票，经过车间主任审查属实后，分别记入财务科的小组节约账和小组所持的节约小折上，作为每月总结节约成绩的根据。
    在一九五四年七月建立小组节约账以前，我厂浪费现象是非常严重的。例如印花色浆由于花色品种不固定，耗浆量不同，在调色时，因怕耽误生产，总是多调一些，有些色浆因存放时间过久，颜色起了变化，只好倒掉。漂炼车间丝光工段工人不愿用回收的碱液；锅炉间烧过的煤灰中经常有很多的黑煤焦；平洗车间工人在干燥机工作完后有一次没有关电门，使机器空转了一夜；机动车间一个见习技术员粗心大意，在设计印花机大铁滚子时把图画错，一次就造成四百多元的损失。
    车间经费和企业管理费方面的浪费也很大，各部门各小组做预算时宽打宽用，要多、要好、要全，领用的物料没人管理，任意丢失，丢了再买，批不准就说要“影响生产”。
    以上这些现象究竟造成了多大的浪费，对成本计划的完成究竟有多大的影响，我们是心中无数的。
    如何使每一个部门和每一个小组都能厉行节约，克服浪费呢？我在去年上半年参加中共天津市委工业部举办的经济活动分析训练班时，学习了苏联“个人节约账户”的先进经验。回厂后同会计人员研究，根据当前条件，决定在我厂先建立小组节约账。在一九五四年七月，我们开始在电工小组进行建立第一个小组节约账的试点工作。当时因为没有经验，看见电线有浪费就节约电线，看见零件有浪费就削减零件预算；但由于没有定额作根据，节约的价值没法计算。第一次试点就垮了。
    我们感到要有计算的根据，就必须制定定额。接着我们又在锅炉小组建立节约账。经过研究和发动工人讨论，制定出用一吨煤把六吨水烧成蒸气作为锅炉小组的定额。烧水少用了煤，多蒸发了气，就作为小组的节约数字。这样，小组工人就感到有了努力方向。大家提出了“少用煤多出蒸气”的口号，努力改进操作。在实行小组节约账的第一个月，就节约了四千多元。八月份，小组工人主动提出把定额修改为用一吨煤把六吨半水烧成蒸气。定额提高以后，八月份还节约了一千七百多元。
    根据锅炉小组的经验，我们又整顿了电工小组的节约账。从掌握节约用电的关键，定出电工小组的定额，规定了功率，无功用电和最大需用量；同时检查了全厂动力用电量，以全厂耗电量最大的工段风泵房和印花机为重点，规定了这个工段每日平均用电量，为今后计算节约的根据。随后，小组节约账就推广到十二个小组。各小组除按不同的定额作为降低消耗的根据而外，在节约预算费用、使用代用品等方面，也想出了不少办法。到一九五四年底，已有十六个小组建立了小组节约账，去年下半年共给国家节约了一万六千多元。
    今年我们在讨论国家计划时，把全面推行小组节约账和在重点车间建立车间成本核算的工作，都列为全年的重要任务。我们发动职工修订了第一季度的小组定额，发动尚未推行小组节约账的小组讨论和制定了小组定额，普遍推行了小组节约账。现在，工厂内各职能科室也建立了小组节约账。
    结合推行小组节约账的工作，在厂内还相应地建立了一些其他的节约制度，都起了很好的配合作用。我们推行小组节约账户以来，有以下几点收获：
    一、全厂职工树立了节约观念，展开了经常性的节约活动，降低了成本。我们在保证完成和超额完成国家计划，特别是完成成本计划上，有了可靠的群众基础。今年一月到六月，根据小组节约账上的节约数字计算，不但节约了十七万多元，而且六个月平均每月降低成本百分之十六以上，其中五月份降低了百分之二十一。车间经费和企业管理费也大大地降低了。如企业管理费在今年三、四、五三个月中，平均每月都比计划降低四千元以上。
    二、保证了质量。今年一至六月完成质量指标一月比一月好。一月份八种产品有六种没有完成质量计划，二月份六种产品，就有五种完成了质量计划，从三月起，月月都全面超额完成质量计划了。
    三、加强了职工群众的主人翁思想，发挥了监督生产的作用。如电工小组通过建立小组节约账，掌握了全厂的用电，每天主动地统计考查用电情况，同时监督了风泵房、印花间这些重点用电部门合理用电，不使他们放空车。锅炉小组经常研究如何使煤的发热量增高，如何保证锅炉不受损失，多蒸发蒸气。丝光机小组实行小组节约账后，工人们感到过去用净水刷车，废水都流到碱池里，会把废碱液的度数冲淡，在回收火碱时浪费煤，浪费工时，于是就改用度数小的废碱液刷车。过去废机器零件长期扔在院子里无人管理，现在，保全修理部门的工人已主动地进行了整理和保管，并把其中能用的尽量加以利用。
    四、通过建立小组节约账，全面完成计划的思想也建立起来了。过去我厂有些人说：要保证质量就不能考虑消耗。现在没有这种说法了，大家已经认识到全面完成国家各项计划指标，是完全可以做到的。
    此外，通过推行小组节约账的工作，还能及时反映出生产中的问题。如一九五四年八月份锅炉车间完成了定额，可是实际用煤量比七月份高。如果单从数字看，应从锅炉方面想办法降低用煤量。后经分析小组节约账后，证明是使用气的车间有浪费，调度生产有问题所造成的，使我们知道了应该改进用气车间的工作。
    建立小组节约账在降低成本中的作用和成绩是很大的。我们一定努力克服现有的缺点，进一步巩固群众性的节约工作。
