    Correct Attitude Towards Ordering
    Kong Sang
    This year, when the state organized the ordering of electromechanical equipment, many orders that could be manufactured domestically were not accepted by factories. For example, one unit placed an order with the Wuchang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory for open wagons of thirty tons, worth about 500,000 yuan. However, the Wuchang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory refused to accept the order because it felt the quantity was too small. The state needs hundreds of thousands of sets of non-standard series of automotive bearings every year, but the Harbin and Wafangdian Ball Bearing Plants emphasize that they are "British and American sizes" and not the "development direction" of the enterprise, refusing to accept them, resulting in the state having to spend tens of millions of yuan in foreign exchange to import them from abroad every year. The Wuhan and Anshan Iron and Steel Companies needed forty-five-ton steam railway cranes. The Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Industry Administration initially emphasized that it was not its development direction, then claimed that it had no production capacity, and finally lied that it "had not produced it in the past," refusing to accept it.
    Why is this abnormal situation occurring? In addition to some cases where the ordering units insisted on the latest or special specifications, which did increase the difficulty of manufacturing, in the mechanical manufacturing sector, the important reason is that the leaders of some factories are afraid of difficulties and dislike trouble. They are only willing to do batch production orders, not individual production orders; only willing to do standard equipment, not non-standard equipment; emphasizing their own professional development direction, and even if they can do products that are not their own specialty, they are unwilling to accept them. The reason they take this attitude is to learn from the lessons of last year and be more cautious.
    What were the lessons of last year? Last year was a year of great exposure of the basic contradictions of the machinery industry - many old products that could be made could not be sold, and the new products needed by the state could not be made. So everyone actively took on miscellaneous tasks to fill their empty stomachs. And some units, after taking in the orders, did not make adequate preparations, did not develop process regulations, and did not comply with the trial production procedures. As a result, the tasks were not completed on time, and the quality was not good, causing the ordering units to complain and affecting national construction.
    Having learned the lessons of last year, the leaders of mechanical industrial enterprises deeply realized that they must work hard to improve the enterprise's organizational work and improve technical level. Without a good work foundation, relying solely on blind enthusiasm is not feasible. Therefore, for more than half a year, mechanical industrial enterprises have attached great importance to the reform of enterprise work and have spent a lot of effort on it. However, in the process of reform, some people have developed a conservative tendency. They hope that the types of products they undertake will be simpler and easier to make, and that they can carry out reforms under more "favorable" conditions. In this way, production can be organized in a more orderly manner, technical problems can be easily solved, and the enterprise can complete its tasks more easily.
    Obviously, this idea and practice are both wrong. They forgot that the purpose of reforming enterprise work is to meet the requirements of national construction, not to reform for the sake of reform. If we don't make things that the country needs and that we can do, then what is the point of having a good work order in the enterprise? Furthermore, the machinery industry currently faces the contradiction that equipment efficiency cannot be fully utilized on the one hand, and the total value of production cannot reach the national requirements on the other hand. Under these circumstances, each mechanical factory should overcome difficulties, tap potential, and try to undertake more new products. This can not only accumulate funds for the country, but also improve the technical and management level of the enterprise.
    Of course, completing sporadic, non-specialized, and non-standard equipment is more troublesome, takes more time, and requires being prepared to experience some failures. From the perspective of the local interests of an enterprise, it is indeed somewhat "disadvantageous". However, from the perspective of the overall interests of the country, being able to do what could not be done in the past, and being able to supply domestically what originally had to be bought from abroad, is obviously a very worthwhile thing.
    Comrades working in various mechanical factories, take the national interest as the most important thing and quickly correct this bias.

    端正对待订货的态度
    孔桑
    今年国家在组织机电设备订货时，有不少国内可以制造的订货没有工厂承制。例如：有一个单位向武昌机车车辆制造厂订购三十吨敞车，价值约五十万元。但武昌机车车辆制造厂却嫌数量太少，拒绝承接。国家每年需要几十万套非标准系列的汽车轴承，哈尔滨和瓦房店两个滚珠轴承厂却强调是“英美尺寸”，不是企业的“发展方向”，不肯承接，结果国家每年要花千万元的外汇从国外进口。武汉和鞍山钢铁公司需要四十五吨的蒸汽铁道吊车，机车车辆制造工业管理局始则强调不是自己的发展方向，继又提出没有生产能力，最后又扯谎说“过去没有生产过”，拒绝承接。
    为什么会产生这种不正常的状况呢？除了有些是订货单位硬要最新式的或特殊的规格品种，的确增加了制造的困难外，在机械制造部门来说，重要的原因是有些工厂的领导人员怕困难、嫌麻烦。他们只愿做成批生产的定货，不愿做个别生产的订货；只愿做标准设备，不愿做非标准设备；强调自己专业的发展方向，非自己专业的产品，虽然能做，也不肯承接。他们采取这种态度的理由是接受去年的教训，谨慎一些为妙。
    去年的教训是什么呢？去年是机械工业的基本矛盾大暴露的一年——许多能做的老产品销不了，国家需要的新产品又不会做。于是大家都积极地揽杂活，来填满吃不饱的肚子。而有些单位把订货揽进来之后，也不进行充分的准备，也不编制工艺规程，也不遵守试制程序。结果到时候任务完不成，质量又不好，弄得订货单位怨声载道，国家建设受到影响。
    接受了去年的教训，机械工业企业的领导人员深刻地体会到必须努力改善企业的组织工作，提高技术水平。没有良好的工作做基础，只凭盲目的积极，是行不通的。因此，半年多来，机械工业的各个企业都十分重视企业的改革工作，在这上面花了很大的力量。但是，在改革的过程中，却有一些人滋长了一种保守的倾向。他们希望承制的产品种类单纯一些，容易做一些，希望在比较“有利”的条件下进行改革。这样，生产就容易组织得有条理，技术问题也容易解决，本企业也就能够比较轻松地完成任务。
    显然，这种想法和做法都是错误的。他们忘记了，改革企业工作的目的是为了满足国家的建设要求，而不是为改革而改革。假如国家需要而我们又能做的东西都不做，那末，企业的工作秩序再好，又有什么意义呢？再说，目前机械工业有一方面设备效能不能充分发挥，一方面生产总值又不能达到国家要求的矛盾。在这种情况下，各个机械工厂更应该克服困难，挖掘潜力，尽量承制更多的新的产品。这不仅可给国家积累资金，也可提高本企业的技术和管理水平。
    当然，完成零星的、不是自己专行的、非标准的设备，比较麻烦，要多花费一些时间，要准备经历一些失败。这从一个企业的局部利益看来，确是有些“吃亏”。但是，从国家的整体利益来看，过去不能做的能做了，原来要向国外买的国内可以供应了，这显然是十分上算的事情。
    各个机械工厂中的工作同志们，要以国家利益为重，迅速纠正这种偏向。
