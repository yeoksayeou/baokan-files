On the waves of the Shkumbin River,
On the bright blue water, songs resound.
The songs of a hundred work teams echo around the riverbanks.
For the people of Albania,
How beautiful is free labor!

This is a joyous song by the Albanian poet Drago Siliqi, celebrating the completion of the first railway in Albania by the Albanian people under the strong leadership of the Albanian Labor Party.

Albania has a history of nearly three thousand years and is one of the oldest nations in the Balkan Peninsula. Geographically, Albania is surrounded by mountains and the sea, located in the southwest of the Balkan Peninsula, bordering the Adriatic and Ionian coasts. It was a vital hub for east-west land and sea transportation in the era of the ancient Roman Empire and is a peaceful outpost of our peace and democracy camp. For a full twenty centuries, the Albanian people have waged tenacious struggles against the barbaric invasions of the ancient Roman Empire, the Eastern and Western Roman Empires, the Turkish Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the German, Italian, and French fascist bandits. The Albanian people have a great tradition of bravery, tenacity, and resistance to aggression. During World War II, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, the Albanian people finally organized an armed force of 70,000 people and, in coordination with the Soviet army, completely liberated their homeland. Albanians love their national heroes and figures with revolutionary heroism. Whether they are children or the elderly, they admire and respect the national hero Skanderbeg, who led the Albanian people in resisting Turkish aggression for twenty-five years in the fifteenth century. During the Liberation War in World War II, countless mythical national heroes emerged in Albania. These heroic figures are still the protagonists of Albanian folk songs, epics, marches, elegies, and lyrical songs. The victorious Albanian people are confidently carrying out socialist construction.

The Song and Dance Troupe of the Albanian People's Army is a product of the people's revolution. To liberate themselves, the Albanian people waged a tenacious armed struggle against the Italian and German fascist bandits. The Song and Dance Troupe of the People's Army was born in this national liberation struggle. When it began its extraordinary artistic activities, its members were composed of talented people's soldiers drawn from guerrilla units and combat troops. From the day it was founded, it actively participated in all the battles of the Albanian People's Army, performing for the people's soldiers and the people in the liberated areas. The realistic art of the Song and Dance Troupe of the People's Army fully reflects the aspirations and feelings of the Albanian people, and in the harsh battles, it encouraged the Albanian People's Army and the people to make meritorious achievements. The songs created by the Song and Dance Troupe of the People's Army during the years of the national liberation struggle were mostly dedicated to the revolutionary heroes of the people. Among them are Thoma Leka's "Revenge" and "First Assault Division," Kristo Kono's "Second Brigade," and Mustafa Krantja's "Hasan Gjeleni" and "Song of the Fourth and Fifth Brigades." These songs are calls to battle, inspiring the great emotions of patriotism and revolutionary heroism in the people's soldiers. It often happened that when the people's soldiers were willing to sacrifice their lives for their beloved motherland, they would sing these songs to encourage each other.

The Song and Dance Troupe of the People's Army has a close, flesh-and-blood connection with the Albanian people. The Albanian People's Army protects the peaceful labor of the people like the pupils of their eyes, and the Song and Dance Troupe of the Albanian People's Army tirelessly reflects and praises the people's beautiful and happy labor life with a high degree of party spirit and artistry. The Albanian people have a deep affection for the Song and Dance Troupe of the People's Army because its beautiful art, which is full of combativeness and mass character, reflects the people's demands, aspirations, peaceful labor, and heroic emotions, and enriches the people's cultural life.

The Song and Dance Troupe of the People's Army often makes tour performances in the troops for the people's soldiers. The people's soldiers love the Song and Dance Troupe of the People's Army, and the work of the Song and Dance Troupe of the People's Army is a brilliant example of serving the soldiers. The Song and Dance Troupe of the People's Army constantly draws on the heroic deeds of the people's soldiers to enrich its performance programs, and the Song and Dance Troupe of the People's Army is good at comprehensively reflecting and praising the revolutionary moral qualities of the people's soldiers and their patriotism and internationalism. The Song and Dance Troupe of the People's Army is an inspirer of the fighting will of the people's soldiers.

The Albanian people have a wealth of folk creations. For a full twenty centuries, in order to resist the aggression and persecution of foreign nations, countless outstanding singers and poets have emerged among the people. The creative power of the people is always vibrant. The people's narrative songs, heroic odes, lyrical songs, elegies, and love songs reflect the rich and varied life of the people and the history of the Albanian people. Some of these folk songs narrate the wars between the various tribes in northwestern Balkans in ancient times; some praise the brilliant achievements of the Albanian soldiers in the Battle of Kosovo in 1389; some sing of Skanderbeg, and some narrate the struggle against the Turks and the independence of Albania. Mythical heroes such as Mujo and Halil Tirde, and Alis Alide, are the embodiment of the bold and fearless heroes praised by the Albanian people. Folk poetry with the theme of the national liberation movement from 1939 to 1944 is particularly rich. They praise the leader of the Albanian people, Enver Hoxha, praise the national heroes who sacrificed their lives to fight against the fascist occupying forces, praise the great friend of the Albanian people, Stalin, and praise the Soviet Union. After national liberation, folk epics have continued to be enriched, and many poems have appeared praising the independence and revival of the motherland, praising the great socialist construction carried out by the people under the leadership of the Labor Party, and praising the people's forces fighting for peace. The figures praised in Albanian folk songs are mostly heroes who take up arms to resist the enemy and defend their land, homes, tribes, motherland, and honor. Albanian folk songs have defended Albanian culture, purified the Albanian language, and defeated all attempts by invaders to interfere barbarously in Albanian culture and art for centuries. Albanian folk creation is a rich treasure for studying the history and culture of the Albanian people.

The Song and Dance Troupe of the People's Army attaches great importance to singing the rich folk creations that are circulating among the people and the people's soldiers. Their performance programs constantly draw nourishment from folk songs. They attach great importance to the processing and arrangement of folk songs. The Song and Dance Troupe of the People's Army is the inheritor of the fighting and beautiful folk song tradition of Albania.

The Song and Dance Troupe of the People's Army uses the advanced Soviet artistic experience to guide its daily work. The artistic thought of socialist realism guides the artistic practice of the Song and Dance Troupe of the People's Army. The content of the Song and Dance Troupe of the People's Army's programs mainly reflects the combat life of the Albanian People's Army. In the performance programs, programs depicting the national liberation war, national economic recovery, and socialist construction, as well as programs from the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, occupy an important position.

We warmly welcome the Song and Dance Troupe of the Albanian People's Army to visit our country. The great struggle of the Albanian people and the great struggle of our people, the fighting artistic practice of the Song and Dance Troupe of the Albanian People's Army and the fighting artistic practice of the cultural and artistic troupes of our People's Liberation Army, have many common points and many similarities. Their visit and performance will enhance the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the people and the people's soldiers of our two fraternal countries and will contribute to the progress of our country's song and dance art. We wish our distinguished guests, our close brothers, who came from the distant Adriatic coast, a successful visit and performance in our country.

    欢迎阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团
    中国人民解放军总政治部文化部文艺处处长  宋之的
    在希库姆比河的波浪上，
    在明亮的碧水上歌声在流响。
    一百个工作队的歌声响澈了周围的河岸。
    对于人民的阿尔巴尼亚，
    自由的劳动该是多么美好！
    这是阿尔巴尼亚人民诗人德拉高·席里奇，歌颂阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的坚强领导下，在祖国的土地上建成了第一条铁路的欢乐的歌。
    阿尔巴尼亚有近三千年的历史，是巴尔干半岛上历史最悠久的民族之一。阿尔巴尼亚在地理上依山傍海，地处巴尔干半岛的西南部，临亚得里亚和爱奥尼亚海岸，是古罗马帝国时代东西方水陆交通的要冲，是我们和平民主阵营的和平前哨。阿尔巴尼亚人民，在整整二十个世纪中，对古罗马帝国、东西罗马帝国、土耳其帝国、奥托曼帝国、德、意法西斯强盗的野蛮侵略，进行了顽强的斗争。阿尔巴尼亚人民有着英勇、顽强、反抗侵略的伟大传统。第二次世界大战中，阿尔巴尼亚人民终于在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，组织起七万人的武装力量，配合苏联军队全部解放了自己的国土。阿尔巴尼亚人热爱自己的民族英雄和具有革命英雄气概的人物。无论是小孩，无论是老人，都景仰和尊敬民族英雄斯坎德倍格，斯坎德倍格曾在十五世纪领导阿尔巴尼亚人民反抗土耳其侵略达二十五年之久。第二次世界大战时，在解放战争中更涌现了无数的阿尔巴尼亚神话式的民族英雄。这些英雄人物至今依然是阿尔巴尼亚民歌、史诗、进行曲，挽歌和抒情歌曲的主人翁。胜利了的阿尔巴尼亚人民正满怀信心地进行社会主义建设。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团是人民革命的产儿。阿尔巴尼亚人民为了自己的解放，同意大利和德国法西斯强盗进行了顽强的武装斗争。人民军歌舞团就是在这个民族解放斗争中产生的。人民军歌舞团在开始其非凡的文艺活动时，其成员是从游击队和战斗部队中抽调富有艺术天才的人民战士组成的。它从成立那天起就积极地参加了阿尔巴尼亚人民军的一切战役，为人民战士和解放区人民进行演出。人民军歌舞团的现实主义艺术，充分反映了阿尔巴尼亚人民的愿望和感情，在严酷的战斗中鼓舞了阿尔巴尼亚人民军和人民去建立功勋。人民军歌舞团在民族解放斗争的年代里所创作的歌曲，大都是献给人民的革命英雄人物的。其中有托拉·列克的“复仇”和“第一突击师”，克里斯托·柯诺的“第二旅”，穆斯塔弗·克兰奇的“哈赛木杰列尼”和“第四、第五旅之歌”。这些歌曲是战斗的号角，鼓舞了人民战士的爱国主义和革命英雄主义的伟大情感。经常有这样的情况，当人民战士为了他们所热爱的祖国不惜献出自己的生命时，人民战士就唱起这些歌曲相互鼓励。
    人民军歌舞团同阿尔巴尼亚人民有着密切的血肉联系。阿尔巴尼亚人民军像保护自己的眼珠一样保护着人民的和平劳动，阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团则不倦地以高度的党性和艺术性来反映和歌颂人民的美好的、幸福的劳动生活。阿尔巴尼亚人民群众对人民军歌舞团有着深厚的感情，因为人民军歌舞团以其富有战斗性和群众性的优美艺术反映了人民的要求、渴望、和平劳动和英雄情感，丰富了人民的文化生活。
    人民军歌舞团经常在部队中为人民战士作巡回演出。人民战士热爱人民军歌舞团，人民军歌舞团的工作是为兵服务的光辉范例。人民军歌舞团不断地汲取人民战士的英雄事迹来丰富自己的演出节目，人民军歌舞团善于全面地反映和歌颂人民战士的革命道德品质和爱国主义、国际主义精神。人民军歌舞团是人民战士战斗意志的鼓舞者。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民拥有丰富的民间创作。在整整二十个世纪中，为了反抗异民族的侵略和迫害，人民中涌现了无数量的优秀的歌手和诗人。人民的创作力量永远是生气蓬勃的。人民的叙事歌曲、英雄颂歌、抒情歌曲、挽歌和恋歌，反映了丰富多采的人民生活，反映了阿尔巴尼亚人民的历史。这些民歌，有的叙述古代巴尔干西北部各个部落间的战争；有的歌颂一三八九年阿尔巴尼亚士兵在柯索沃战役中的辉煌战绩；有的歌唱斯坎德倍格，有的则叙述了反土耳其人的斗争和阿尔巴尼亚的独立。像摩伊奥和哈里里·梯尔得、爱力斯·阿里得这样的神话英雄，就是阿尔巴尼亚人民所歌颂的大胆无畏的英雄的化身。以一九三九年到一九四四年民族解放运动为题材的民间诗歌，特别丰富。它们歌颂了阿尔巴尼亚人民领袖恩维尔·霍查，歌颂了为反对法西斯占领军而献出生命的民族英雄，歌颂了阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大朋友斯大林，歌颂了苏联。全国解放以后，民间史诗不断地丰富起来，出现了许多歌颂祖国的独立和复兴、歌颂人民在劳动党领导下所进行的巨大的社会主义建设、歌颂为和平而斗争的人民力量的诗歌。阿尔巴尼亚民歌中所歌颂的人物，大都是手执武器去抵抗敌人，保卫自己的土地、家园、部落、祖国和荣誉的英雄。阿尔巴尼亚的民歌，捍卫了阿尔巴尼亚的文化，纯洁了阿尔巴尼亚的语言，使多少个世纪以来侵略者在对阿尔巴尼亚的文化艺术进行蛮横干涉的一切企图遭到了失败。阿尔巴尼亚的民间创作，是研究阿尔巴尼亚人民的历史和文化的丰富宝藏。
    人民军歌舞团非常重视演唱在人民和人民战士中所流传的丰富的民间创作。他们的上演节目，不断从民歌中汲取养分。他们很重视民歌的加工和整理工作。人民军歌舞团是阿尔巴尼亚战斗的、优美的民歌传统的继承者。
    人民军歌舞团以先进的苏联艺术经验来指导自己的日常工作。社会主义现实主义的艺术思想指导着人民军歌舞团的艺术实践。人民军歌舞团的节目内容主要是反映阿尔巴尼亚人民军的战斗生活。在演出节目中，描写民族解放战争、国家经济恢复和社会主义建设的节目，以及苏联和各人民民主国家的节目占有重要的地位。
    我们热烈欢迎阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团来我国访问。阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大斗争和我国人民的伟大斗争，阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团的战斗的艺术实践和我国人民解放军文工团的战斗的艺术实践，有着很大的共同点，很多的相似处。他们的访问演出，将增进我们两个兄弟国家的人民和人民战士的永恒的牢不可破的友谊，将有助于我国的歌舞艺术的进步。我们预祝从遥远的亚得里亚海岸来的、我们的尊贵的客人们，我们亲密的兄弟们，在我国的访问演出成功。
