In his congratulatory speech, Vietnamese Chargé d'Affaires Zhou Liang said that the China-Vietnam joint railway transport connects Vietnam with the countries of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, which will help expand and develop economic and cultural exchanges between Vietnam and other fraternal countries.

On behalf of the people of Beijing, Deputy Mayor Wang Kunlun congratulated on the increasingly smooth transportation between Beijing and Hanoi, and the increasingly close relationship between the people of Beijing and Hanoi.

Passengers on this train to Vietnam included the entire delegation and art troupe of the Korean people visiting Vietnam, representatives of Vietnam attending the World Mothers' Congress, and Ye Jinghao, Commercial Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Vietnam, and others.

After August 2nd, joint passenger trains will depart from China to Vietnam every Tuesday and Friday, and joint passenger trains from Vietnam will also come to China twice a week. Passengers traveling between China and Vietnam only need to purchase one ticket when boarding from Beijing, Hankou, Nanning, and Pingxiang in China to Hanoi and Lang Son stations in Vietnam; except for inspecting the train when crossing the river in Hankou, they only need to change trains once at Pingxiang Station. The entire journey from Beijing to Hanoi is approximately 2,970 kilometers, and the travel time is only a little over four days.

The consignment procedures for China-Vietnam joint railway freight transport have been handled since August 1st. In the past, cargo transport between the two countries had to go through transshipment procedures at Pingxiang Station. Now, only one consignment procedure needs to be completed at the originating station to reach the destination.
