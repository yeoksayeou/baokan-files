    Large Quantities of Wool from Hulunbuir Grassland Enter the Market

    Wool from the Hulunbuir grassland in eastern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been entering the market in large quantities. Herdsmen are selling cartloads of wool to supply and marketing cooperatives to support national industrial production. In the three purchasing stations of the New Barag Left Banner Supply and Marketing Cooperative alone, more than 95,000 jin of wool and more than 6,000 jin of goat cashmere were purchased in five days. Some supply and marketing cooperatives have also sent out temporary purchasing stations to the summer campsites where herders congregate to purchase wool. In 1954, the eastern region of Inner Mongolia supplied the state with more than 1.5 million jin of wool, and this year even more wool will be supplied to the state.

    呼伦贝尔草原羊毛大量上市
    内蒙古自治区东部呼伦贝尔草原上的羊毛已经大量上市。牧民们正在把成车的羊毛卖给供销合作社，支援国家工业生产。仅新巴尔虎左翼旗供销合作社的三处收购站，在五天内就收购羊毛九万五千多斤、山羊绒六千多斤。有些供销合作社还派出临时收购站，到牧民集居的夏营地去收购羊毛。一九五四年内蒙古东部区曾供给国家羊毛一百五十多万斤，今年将有更多的羊毛供给国家。
