    The political conference in Laos, interrupted six times by the Kingdom of Laos government, resumed on July 15. At the same time, the military conference between the two sides discussing the cessation of military conflict is also continuing. This is entirely in the interests of the Lao people and is welcomed by the peace-loving people of Laos and the world. However, now, more than a month has passed, and no progress has been made in the political and military negotiations between the two sides in Laos. Moreover, all indications show that the Kingdom Government is attempting to use negotiations to cover up its plan to expand the military conflict.

    In order to seek the success of the Lao political conference and maintain peace in Laos, military conflict must be stopped immediately. As everyone knows, the military conflict in Laos is the result of the Kingdom of Laos army's continuous attacks on the assembly areas of the Pathet Lao Fighting Units. Therefore, it is entirely proper for the Lao people to demand that the Kingdom Government stop this military offensive and hold negotiations on the principles of equality, mutual understanding, and mutual accommodation. However, the Kingdom of Laos government continues to insist on the "surrender" of the Pathet Lao Fighting Units in the negotiations, while intensifying the concentration of troops and launching military offensives, attempting to eliminate the Pathet Lao Fighting Units by force. Since the beginning of August, such military offensives have been constantly occurring and expanding, seriously threatening the peace of Laos.

    The Lao Kingdom authorities are trying their best to create the myth that the Pathet Lao Fighting Units are attacking the Kingdom forces, attempting to cover up the truth. On August 20, the spokesperson for the Kingdom Government openly slandered the Pathet Lao Fighting Units for launching an offensive, and said that this was part of a "general offensive." This spokesperson obviously intended to shift the responsibility for the "very serious situation" onto the Pathet Lao Fighting Units. But this kind of distortion and propaganda can no longer deceive people. Military conflict is taking place within the assembly areas of the Pathet Lao Fighting Units designated by the Geneva Accords, and not outside the assembly areas. That is to say, the military conflict was provoked and organized by the Kingdom forces within the assembly areas of the Pathet Lao Fighting Units, and not the so-called offensive launched by the Pathet Lao Fighting Units towards outside the assembly areas. This is an iron fact. Now, the seriousness of the problem lies in the fact that the Kingdom Government is not satisfied with the important strongholds and areas it has illegally invaded and occupied in the assembly areas, and also wants to further divide and occupy the entire Pathet Lao Fighting Units assembly areas of Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces. It must be pointed out that such an attempt can only lead to dangerous consequences.

    The reason why the political conference has made no progress after its resumption is that the Kingdom Government does not want to recognize these dangerous consequences and still wants to replace a political solution with a military solution. The Pathet Lao Fighting Units have repeatedly recognized the supreme authority of the Kingdom Government and agreed to resolve the administrative management issues of Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces, but insisted that the democratic and free rights of the people must be guaranteed, and that free general elections with the participation of the Pathet Lao Fighting Units should be held nationwide to achieve the democratic unification of Laos. This consistent proposition of the Pathet Lao Fighting Units proceeds from the interests of the motherland and has been supported by the Lao people. The agenda passed by the political conference on July 18 was in fact determined on the basis of this proposition. However, the Kingdom Government has consistently had no intention of resolving the issue of free general elections in the negotiations, and unreasonably demanded that the Pathet Lao Fighting Units be disarmed and that the Kingdom Government establish a regime in the assembly areas. The Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos even issued a statement on July 19, openly declaring that the Pathet Lao Fighting Units would not be allowed to participate in the national general election. This attitude of the Kingdom Government violates the provisions of Article 3 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference and Articles 14 and 19 of the Lao Ceasefire Agreement. The Kingdom Government's adoption of this attitude is completely inconsistent with the interests of the Lao people in achieving democratic unification of the motherland and consolidating peace.

    It must be pointed out that the development of the current serious situation in Laos can only benefit the international forces that are deliberately trying to drag Laos into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc and turn Laos into a military base for creating wars. This international conspiracy is intensifying as the situation in Laos deteriorates, and this is no secret. The Kingdom of Laos Government issued a communiqué on July 17, expressing its disagreement with the serious conspiracy of some people at that time to use the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc to interfere in Laos' internal affairs, believing that Laos' internal affairs should be resolved in accordance with the Geneva Accords. This is in line with the position expressed by the Kingdom of Laos Government at the Asian-African Conference. However, the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, Katay Don Sasorith, openly said in a speech in Bangkok on July 22 that in an emergency, the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc "has a responsibility to take action" to interfere in Laos' internal affairs. Can't people clearly see what kind of bad consequences allowing the intervention of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc will cause? For the sake of peace in Laos and Indochina, and for the national interests of Laos, the time has come for the Kingdom of Laos Government to abandon its military adventure.

    The military conflict in Laos should be stopped quickly, and the political settlement of the Laos issue based on the Geneva Accords must be realized. This is the common wish of the Lao people and peace-loving people all over the world. Facts have proved that ignoring this wish will not have good results. The countries participating in the Geneva Conference bear an unshirkable responsibility for improving the current situation in Laos.

### 老挝的局势应该迅速改善

    老挝的局势应该迅速改善
    老挝王国政府第六次中断了的政治会议，已于七月十五日复会。同时，讨论停止军事冲突的双方军事会议也在继续举行。这是完全符合老挝人民的利益的，是老挝和全世界爱好和平的人民所欢迎的。但是，现在，一个多月又过去了，老挝双方的政治、军事谈判都没有获得任何进展，而且，种种迹象显示，王国政府正企图用谈判来掩盖它扩大军事冲突的计划。
    为了谋求老挝政治会议的成功和维护老挝的和平，就必须立即停止军事冲突。大家知道，老挝的军事冲突，是老挝王国军队不断对寮国战斗部队集结区进行攻击的结果。因此，老挝人民要求王国政府停止这种军事进攻，在平等、互谅、互让的原则上举行谈判，是完全正当的。但是，老挝王国政府在谈判中继续坚持要寮国战斗部队“投降”，同时加紧集结兵力，发动军事进攻，企图以武力消灭寮国战斗部队。八月初以来，这种军事进攻不断发生和扩大，严重地威胁着老挝的和平。
    老挝王国当局竭力制造所谓寮国战斗部队进攻王国部队的神话，企图掩盖事实真相。八月二十日，王国政府发言人就公开诬蔑寮国战斗部队发动了进攻，并说什么这是“总攻势”的一部分。这个发言人显然有意地想把“局势很严重”的责任推在寮国战斗部队身上。但是这种歪曲宣传早已骗不了人。军事冲突是在日内瓦协定所指定的寮国战斗部队集结地区内进行，而不是发生在集结地区以外。也就是说，军事冲突是王国部队在寮国战斗部队集结地区内挑起和组织的，而不是所谓寮国战斗部队向集结区外发动了进攻。这是铁的事实。现在，问题的严重性在于：王国政府不满足于它非法侵入集结区所占领的重要据点和地区，还想进一步分割和占领整个寮国战斗部队集结区丰沙里和桑怒两省。不能不指出，这种企图只能导致危险的后果。
    政治会议恢复后所以仍旧一无进展，原因就是王国政府还不想认识这种危险后果，还想用军事解决来代替政治解决。寮国战斗部队方面曾一再承认王国政府的最高权力，同意解决桑怒和丰沙里两省的行政管理问题，但主张必须保障人民的民主自由权利，在全国范围内举行有寮国战斗部队参加的自由普选，以实现老挝的民主统一。寮国战斗部队这个一贯的主张，是从祖国的利益出发的，它得到了老挝人民的拥护。七月十八日政治会议通过的议程，事实上也是在这个主张的基础上确定的。但是，王国政府在谈判中却始终无意解决自由普选的问题，并无理要求寮国战斗部队解除武装，让王国政府在集结区建立政权。老挝王国首相甚至在七月十九日发表声明，公然宣称不让寮国战斗部队参加全国普选。王国政府这种态度违反了日内瓦会议最后宣言第三条和老挝停止敌对行动协定第十四、十九条的规定。王国政府采取这种态度完全不符合老挝人民实现祖国民主统一和巩固和平的利益。
    必须指出，目前老挝严重局势的发展，只能有利于处心积虑地要把老挝拉入东南亚侵略集团，把老挝变为制造战争的军事基地的国际势力。这个国际阴谋正在乘老挝局势的恶化而加紧进行，这并不是什么秘密。老挝王国政府曾在七月十七日发表公报，对当时有人想利用东南亚侵略集团干涉老挝内政的严重阴谋，表示不能同意，认为老挝的内政问题应根据日内瓦协定加以解决。这是符合老挝王国政府在亚非会议上表明的立场的。但是，老挝王国首相克特七月二十二日在曼谷发表的谈话，却又公然说，在紧急情况下，东南亚侵略集团“有责任采取行动”，干涉老挝的内政。难道竟还有人不能清楚地看到，允许东南亚侵略集团的干涉会造成什么样的恶果么？为了老挝和印度支那的和平，为了老挝的民族利益，老挝王国政府放弃它的军事冒险的时候应该已经到了。
    老挝的军事冲突应该迅速停止，根据日内瓦协定的老挝问题政治解决必须实现，这是老挝和全世界爱好和平人民的普遍愿望。事实证明，要漠视这个愿望，是不会有好结果的。参加日内瓦会议国家对于改善目前的老挝局势负有不可推卸的责任。
