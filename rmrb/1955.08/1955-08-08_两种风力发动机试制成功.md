    Two Types of Wind-powered Engines Successfully Trial-produced

    The Jinzhou Agricultural Experiment Station in Liaoning Province has successfully trial-produced two types of wind-powered engines. One is a small windmill that drives a liberation-style waterwheel to pump water for irrigating farmland; the other is a wind-powered engine used to generate electricity or drive pumps. The first type, the small windmill, has a wood and iron structure and canvas wind blades. When the wind speed is 3 meters per second, and the lift (the distance from the wellhead to the water surface) does not exceed 4 meters, it can drive a liberation-style waterwheel to pump 4 to 8 tons of water per hour (depending on the wind strength). Currently, it is being tested for irrigating paddy fields at the Gongjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Daweizi Village, a suburb of Jinzhou City. The second type is a prototype of a high-speed wind-powered engine. The wind blades are designed according to the principle of streamlined propellers and are entirely metal. When the wind speed is 4 meters per second, the wind-powered engine can start, and at a wind speed of 8 meters per second, it can generate 3 horsepower. To maintain a constant speed in varying wind conditions after the windmill starts, air brakes are installed on the tips of the wind blades, and a flywheel is installed next to the generator to regulate the speed. To keep the wind blades facing the wind, a worm gear is installed to automatically adjust the direction with the wind. This engine is easy to operate and control from the ground. Currently, it has been equipped with a generator and a water pump and is being tested within the experiment station for pumping water and generating electricity. (Jiang Boyuan, Li Su)

    两种风力发动机试制成功
    辽宁省锦州农业试验站试制成功了两种风力发动机。一种是带动解放式水车抽水灌溉农田的小型风车；另一种是用来发电或带动抽水机等的风力发动机。第一种小型风车是铁木结构，帆布风轮，当每秒风速三公尺时，扬程（从井口到水面的距离）不超过四公尺，就能带动解放式水车，每小时能抽水四至八吨（随风力强弱有变动）。目前，正在锦州市郊区大围子村共进农业生产合作社里试用灌溉水田。第二种是高速风力发动机的雏形。风叶是按流线型螺旋桨的原理设计的，全部是金属结构。当每秒风速四公尺时，风力发动机可以起动，到每秒风速八公尺时能发挥三马力的动力。为了使风车发动后在强弱不同风速中保持一定转速，在风叶梢上装有空气制动器，在发电机旁又装有惰性轮，以调节转速。为保持风叶迎风转动，装有蜗轮杆，随风自动调正方向。这种发动机在地面开闭操纵简便。目前，已配上发电机及水泵，正在试验站内试用抽水及发电。　（江博沅、李苏）
