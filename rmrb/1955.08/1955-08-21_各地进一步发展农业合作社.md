Various local Party committees are, according to the instructions of the Central Committee, beginning to further develop agricultural production cooperatives. According to preliminary plans in various regions, before the spring plowing of next year, the number of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide will increase from the original 650,000 to more than 1 million, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives will reach approximately 30 million.

    The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a rural work conference. The conference, based on the spirit of the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party regarding agricultural production cooperatives conveyed by Ouyang Qin, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and in combination with the province's situation, after repeated study and discussion, revised the original preliminary plan for developing cooperatives, which had been set too low. The conference determined that, in the future, on the basis of improving existing cooperatives, it is necessary to actively create conditions for developing new cooperatives and expanding existing cooperatives, conscientiously manage mutual aid groups, and comprehensively implement the policy of voluntary participation and mutual benefit. It requested that before the spring plowing of 1956, the province develop 4,000 to 6,000 cooperatives, with the number of member households accounting for about 50% of the total number of peasant households in the province, and further reach about 70% before the spring plowing of 1957.

    Hunan Province currently has more than 13,000 agricultural production cooperatives and more than 570,000 mutual aid groups. From now until the spring plowing of next year, the province will develop more than 45,000 agricultural production cooperatives. It is planned to develop them in three batches. In addition to establishing more than 13,900 cooperatives before the autumn harvest, another batch will be established after the autumn, and the entire development plan will be completed before the spring plowing of next year. After the entire plan is completed, more than 90% of the townships in Hunan Province will have agricultural production cooperatives, and the number of member households will account for more than 12% of the total number of peasant households in the province. At present, the work of developing agricultural production cooperatives before the autumn harvest in the province has begun comprehensively. The backbone members of the mutual aid groups in each county who are preparing to establish cooperatives have completed training of 60,000 people and returned to their villages to establish cooperatives.

    Yunnan Province will build 16,000 agricultural production cooperatives before the autumn harvest, and another 7,000 to 8,000 will be established before the spring plowing of next year. Guizhou Province plans to complete 40% of its plan for establishing cooperatives before next spring before the autumn harvest.

    Various regions are also, in accordance with the principle of streamlining the upper levels and enriching the lower levels, transferring a large number of personnel to go deep into the countryside to be specifically responsible for the work of developing and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives. According to preliminary statistics from 18 provinces including Hebei, Sichuan, and Hubei, there will be more than 127,000 people going to the countryside. In July, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to transfer more than 11,000 cadres at the level of district committees to 11,464 townships throughout the province to serve as district instructors, generally one person per township, to assist the township leading organs in their work. The first batch of more than 1,000 district instructors, after short-term training, have been successively dispatched to various places in mid-August to begin their work. The second and third batches of instructors will also be concentrated for training successively.

    Around the autumn harvest, all levels of organizations in Hubei Province will transfer approximately 20,000 outstanding cadres to work in the countryside. The 2,800 cadres from the directly subordinate organizations of Hubei Province and Wuhan City who are going to the countryside began centralized training in early August. During the autumn harvest, the primary task of this group of cadres is to concentrate all their efforts on implementing the policy of "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" of grain, and to specifically implement the "three fix" policy to every peasant household. From after the autumn harvest to the end of the year, this group of cadres will gradually shift their full efforts to the work of developing and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party requires that 7,000 to 10,000 experts in running cooperatives be trained from these cadres within one year, and that they be used as the backbone to universally establish agricultural production cooperative instructor groups in the districts, specifically to run cooperatives.

    In addition, the counties in Yunnan Province are training cadres for the large-scale development of agricultural production cooperatives this autumn. Since July, the counties have successively held training classes for activists in cooperatives. Now, the training classes held by five local Party organizations in Chuxiong, Dali, and other places have ended, and the training classes in 34 counties and cities including Qujing, Lijiang, Baoshan, and Simao are in progress. It is estimated that more than 200,000 people will be trained throughout the province before the autumn harvest.

　　各地进一步发展农业合作社
    本报讯　中共各地党委正根据中央的指示，开始进一步发展农业生产合作社。根据各地初步计划，在明年春耕以前，全国农业生产合作社的数目将从原来的六十五万个发展到一百万个以上，入社农民将达到三千万户左右。
    中共黑龙江省委员会最近召开了农村工作会议。会议根据中共黑龙江省委书记欧阳钦传达的中共中央关于农业生产合作社问题的指示的精神，结合本省情况，经过反复研究讨论，重新修订了原来订得偏低的发展社的初步计划。会议确定，今后在提高现有社的基础上，要积极创造条件发展新社和扩大现有社，切实办好互助组，全面地贯彻自愿互利政策，要求在一九五六年春耕前，全省发展四千到六千个社，入社户要占全省农户总数的百分之五十左右，一九五七年春耕前要进一步达到百分之七十左右。
    湖南省现有一万三千多个农业生产合作社、五十七万多个互助组。全省从目前到明年春耕止农业生产合作社将发展到四万五千多个。准备分三批发展，除秋收前建立一万三千九百多个社外，秋后再建一批，明年春耕前全部完成发展计划。全部计划完成以后，湖南省将有百分之九十以上的乡都有农业生产合作社，入社农户将占全省总农户百分之十二以上。目前该省秋收前发展农业生产合作社的工作已全面开始。各县准备建社的互助组的骨干分子，已有六万人训练完毕，回乡建社。
    云南省在秋收前将要建成一万六千个农业生产合作社，明年春耕前再建立七、八千个。贵州省计划秋收前完成明春前建社计划的百分之四十。
    各地还本着精简上层充实下层的方针，抽调大批工作人员深入农村专门负责发展和巩固农业生产合作社的工作。据河北、四川、湖北等十八个省的初步统计，下乡人员将有十二万七千多人。中共河北省委员会在七月间决定抽调相当区委级的干部一万一千多名，分赴全省一万一千四百六十四个乡担任区指导员，大体每乡固定一人帮助乡领导机关工作。第一批一千多名区指导员，经过短期训练以后，已在八月中旬陆续分赴各地开始工作。第二批和第三批指导员，也将陆续集中训练。
    湖北省各级机关在秋收前后将抽调两万名左右优秀干部到农村工作。湖北省和武汉市直属机关下乡的二千八百多干部，八月初已开始集中训练。秋收中，这批干部的首要任务，是集中全力贯彻粮食“定产、定购、定销”政策，把“三定”政策具体贯彻到每一个农户。从秋收以后到年底，这批干部将陆续以全力转入发展和巩固农业生产合作社的工作。中共湖北省委员会要求一年内从这些干部中培养出七千到一万名办社能手，并以他们为骨干普遍在区建立农业生产合作社指导员小组，专门办社。
    此外，云南省各县正为今秋大量发展农业生产合作社训练干部。七月以来，各县都陆续举办了合作社积极分子训练班。现在楚雄、大理等五个中共地方组织举办的训练班已经结束，曲靖、丽江、保山、思茅等三十四个县市的训练班正在进行。预计全省在秋收以前将训练二十万人以上。
