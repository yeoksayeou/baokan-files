Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 24th: The Japanese people have voiced strong opposition to the US measures of transporting atomic rocket launchers to Japan.

    The Japanese Communist Party issued a written statement on the 24th. The statement pointed out that atomic rocket launchers are definitely a type of atomic weapon. The Japanese Communist Party demands that the US military in Japan take this weapon back to the United States.

    Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the right-wing Socialist Party of Japan, issued a statement pointing out that the transportation of atomic rocket launchers into Japan proves that Japan is increasingly becoming a base for atomic weapons. He pointed out that because the Japanese government has consistently concealed the fact that the US is expanding air force bases and transporting atomic weapons into Japan from the Japanese people, the people's indignation and distrust of the Hatoyama Cabinet will increase day by day. The many presumptuous remarks made recently by Shigemasa Sunada, Director-General of the "Defense Agency," will further arouse the people's anger.

    Inejiro Asanuma stated that the right-wing Socialist Party of Japan will further strengthen its struggle against the Hatoyama Cabinet turning Japanese territory into an atomic bomb base and implementing a policy of following the United States.

    Shizuoka Prefecture Governor Saito Hisao issued a statement on the 23rd expressing his absolute opposition to the US military conducting atomic rocket launcher exercises in the Mount Fuji area, destroying the beautiful Mount Fuji area.

　　日本共产党等反对美军把原子武器运到日本
    新华社二十四日讯　东京消息：日本人民对美国把原子火箭发射器运到日本的措施发出了强烈的反对的呼声。
    日本共产党二十四日发表了书面声明。声明指出：原子火箭发射器肯定地是一种原子武器。日本共产党要求驻日美军把这种武器带回美国去。
    日本右派社会党总书记浅沼稻次郎发表谈话指出：把原子火箭发射器运进日本证明日本日益变成原子武器的基地了。他指出：由于日本政府自始至终向日本人民隐瞒美国在日本扩大空军基地和运进原子武器的事实，人民对鸠山内阁的愤慨和不信任将日益增加。最近“防卫厅”长官砂田重政的许多次放肆的言论将更大地激起人民的忿怒。
    浅沼稻次郎表示日本右派社会党将进一步加强斗争，反对鸠山内阁变日本国土为原子弹基地和实行追随美国的政策。
    静冈县县知事齐藤寿夫在二十三日发表谈话表示，他绝对反对美军在富士山地区演习原子火箭发射器，来摧毁美丽的富士山区。
