Resettling demobilized and construction soldiers is a long-term and important policy of our country, as well as a regular and glorious political task for governments at all levels and the entire people. At the same time, it is an unshirkable responsibility for all central departments and local government organs at all levels, people's organizations, and various enterprises and institutions.

The State Council's "Resolution on the Work of Resettling Demobilized and Construction Soldiers," issued in May of this year, has clearly stipulated that all units, when transferring cadres, allocating labor, and recruiting workers, apprentices, staff, and technicians, should regard demobilized and construction soldiers as the first priority for employment. It also instructed labor departments and planning departments to give priority to allocating demobilized and construction soldiers when allocating personnel to newly built and expanded factories and mining enterprises, and to place demobilized and construction soldiers first in labor allocation plans. It also stipulated that personnel departments of governments at all levels should include demobilized and construction soldiers who meet the conditions for cadres in the allocation plan when allocating staff, and allocate them appropriate jobs as appropriate. The State Council's resolution also charged the people's committees of all provinces and cities and the relevant departments of the central government with conducting a review of the employment, training, and use of demobilized construction soldiers in their respective regions and systems. Units that have adopted erroneous attitudes such as refusing to employ, discriminating against, excluding, making things difficult for, or attacking demobilized construction soldiers should be severely criticized or even punished. It requires supervisory departments at all levels to investigate dereliction of duty and illegal events in the work of resettling demobilized construction soldiers by local governments at all levels, and to deal with them seriously. Recently, the State Council also instructed all departments to adopt the method of "fixed responsibility by department" when problems arise in the implementation of the resolution on the work of resettling demobilized construction soldiers due to streamlining of institutions and internal adjustments.

Since the promulgation of the State Council's resolution, people have been pleased to see that the Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education have formulated regulations on properly handling the issue of re-enrollment for demobilized and construction soldiers and have implemented them throughout the education system. The party and government leading organs in Jilin, Hunan, Sichuan, Fujian, Henan and other provinces have done a lot of work to implement the State Council's resolution. The Jilin Provincial Public Security System has decided to recruit all the personnel it needs from demobilized and construction soldiers. Some enterprises and schools in Sichuan Province have taken the initiative to absorb demobilized and construction soldiers when recruiting students and employees. Relevant units in Yuanling County, Hunan Province, seriously reviewed the mistakes of the past in neglecting the resettlement of demobilized and construction soldiers. All employing units have begun to implement the State Council's resolution and have taken the initiative to request the resettlement of demobilized and construction soldiers in their units, which has moved this work forward a step. Liaoning Province has also commended the Fushun Petroleum Factory No. 4 and the Dalian Shipyard, two units that have conscientiously resettled demobilized soldiers. These two enterprises have not only actively absorbed demobilized and construction soldiers and honorary soldiers to participate in work over the years, but have also comprehensively helped them improve their political and technical levels, and appropriately solved their difficulties in life, thus fully exerting the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of these demobilized and construction soldiers, promoting and guaranteeing the completion of production tasks, and training a group of economic cadres and technical personnel for the country.

However, there are still many departments and units that have not conscientiously and responsibly implemented the State Council's resolution. For example, some cadres in the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Railways, and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives of the central departments are like this. They have neither formulated implementation measures for resettling demobilized soldiers in their systems nor actively supported the resettlement work of local authorities. This makes it difficult to carry out some local resettlement work. All localities urgently hope that the central departments will quickly make specific arrangements for implementing the State Council's resolution, but these departments have been slow to make arrangements.

The personnel and labor departments in some regions and units have even adopted various resistant attitudes towards the State Council's resolution. For example, when the Zhejiang Provincial Transportation Electrical Equipment Company needed to add 20 sales staff, the Zhejiang Provincial Personnel Bureau not only did not put demobilized and construction soldiers first in the allocation plan, but also refused to approve the company's application to recruit demobilized and construction soldiers, so that the company has been unable to recruit demobilized and construction soldiers. The Shanxi Provincial Labor Bureau also adopted a perfunctory and evasive attitude towards the resettlement of demobilized and construction soldiers. After the promulgation of the State Council's resolution, they told the Shanxi Provincial Transfer and Construction Committee that "there is no place to ask for people, and demobilized soldiers cannot be resettled"; at the same time, they approved the Yangquan Mining Bureau to recruit new staff. When the Yangquan Mining Bureau was insufficient in recruiting locally and asked the Provincial Labor Bureau for assistance, they still refused to introduce demobilized soldiers to employment. While continuing to deceive the Transfer and Construction Committee by saying that "demobilized soldiers cannot be resettled," they still asked the Yangquan Mining Bureau to go back and recruit again. When the Transfer and Construction Committee discovered this situation and asked to introduce demobilized construction soldiers to employment, the Labor Bureau actually lied to their face, saying, "The Yangquan Mining Bureau has already recruited enough." This Labor Bureau actually refused to implement the State Council's resolution with such a double-faced attitude, which is completely disregarding the law. We believe that the party and government leading organs and supervisory organs of Shanxi Province and Zhejiang Province have the responsibility to immediately conduct a thorough investigation and handling.

There are many other units that have adopted similar attitudes towards the State Council's resolution. For example, the Shandong Provincial Department of Commerce needs to add hundreds of staff, but refuses to recruit demobilized and construction soldiers. The Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Industry used to consistently refuse to recruit demobilized soldiers. After the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee severely criticized them, they recruited them, but they completely did not assign work according to the abilities and awareness of these demobilized and construction soldiers, regardless of their physical conditions, and uniformly assigned them to the Brick and Tile Industry Division, and the Brick and Tile Industry Division uniformly assigned them to brick and tile factories, and the brick and tile factories uniformly assigned them to do trolley work. The Personnel Section of the Bureau of Industry said: "Do it if you want, if you don't want to, please go back, that's how it is here." The purpose of their doing this is to force the demobilized construction soldiers to resign automatically, and indeed some demobilized soldiers have been forced to resign. This attitude of ostensibly complying with but actually opposing the central resolution shows that these organs have been infected with the bad practices of the Kuomintang. Their attitude towards demobilized soldiers is very similar to the attitude of landlords and the bourgeoisie towards the working people, which is absolutely intolerable under our country's laws.

Why does this bad phenomenon occur? The reasons are varied. We have previously criticized the absurd statements such as "demobilized soldiers are difficult to lead" and "demobilized soldiers all have problems." Now we offer another line of thinking. Not long ago, the Ningwu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shanxi Province wanted to recruit more than 80 sales staff. The county people's government sent someone to negotiate, asking them to recruit four qualified demobilized soldiers, but Wu Zihua, the secretary of the supply and marketing cooperative, refused to recruit them. However, the relatives of Han Yinfang, the personnel section chief of the supply and marketing cooperative, the younger brother of the wife of Zheng Jianhua, a cadre of the supply and marketing cooperative, and the son of Wang Binglin, a cadre of the supply and marketing cooperative who has a mental illness, were not in line with the conditions proposed by Wu Zihua, but they were all recruited without any examination. They also long-term employed a former landlord class element who had just had his control removed and a former enemy puppet personnel. It is clear that the reason why Wu Zihua and Han Yinfang refused to allow demobilized soldiers to participate in work was to make room for the recruitment of private individuals and turn the units they managed into their personal domain. This is the essence of the matter. However, after the Shanxi Daily has revealed this event, Wu Zihua and Han Yinfang still occupy the positions of secretary and personnel section chief of the Ningwu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative. It is very wrong for the superior organ of this supply and marketing cooperative and the party and government leading organs and supervisory organs of Ningwu County not to thoroughly investigate and handle this event.

Demobilized construction soldiers come from the glorious Chinese People's Liberation Army. They generally (including those who revolted and those who were liberated) have been tempered and tested by revolutionary war. Although a few of them have shortcomings such as complacency and arrogance, generally speaking, they are politically loyal and reliable, and many of them have shed blood and made contributions in the cause of the people's revolution and the defense of the motherland. They should be cared for and taken care of by the country. A large proportion of demobilized soldiers have also been incorporated into the reserve force of the People's Liberation Army, and they will continue to be the defenders of our country. Therefore, all party and government organizations and enterprise departments should regard the work of resettling demobilized construction soldiers as an important part of our country's national defense construction, regard demobilized construction soldiers as reliable backbones and comrades, give them regular care and enthusiastic help, so that they can quickly improve their political and professional level and make contributions in their new posts. Party committees and governments at all levels should strive to implement the State Council's resolution and conduct a conscientious review of the implementation of the resolution, severely criticize and even punish those units and individuals who refuse to employ, discriminate against, exclude, and unreasonably make things difficult for demobilized construction soldiers, and at the same time commend those units and individuals who conscientiously and responsibly implement the State Council's resolution and have achieved remarkable results. Only in this way can the State Council's resolution be effectively implemented.

### 认真检查安置复员建设军人的工作

    认真检查安置复员建设军人的工作
    安置复员建设军人是我们国家的一项长期的重要政策，也是各级人民政府和全体人民群众的一项经常的光荣的政治任务，同时也是中央各部门和各级地方政府机关、人民团体以及各种企业和事业单位的一种不容推卸的责任。
    今年五月国务院发布的“关于安置复员建设军人工作的决议”中已经明确规定各单位在调用干部、调配劳动力和招收工人、学徒、职员、技术人员的时候，都应当把复员建设军人作为第一位录用的对象；并指示劳动部门和计划部门在给新建、扩建的厂矿企业调配人员的时候，应当优先调配复员建设军人，在劳动力调配计划中把复员建设军人放在第一位；也规定各级政府的人事部门在调配工作人员的时候应当把合于干部条件的复员建设军人列在调配计划之内，酌情分配以适当的工作。国务院的决议还责成各省、市人民委员会和中央各有关部门对所属地区和本系统各单位录用和培养使用复员建设军人的情况进行一次检查，对于那些对复员建设军人采取拒绝录用和歧视、排斥、刁难、打击等错误态度的单位，予以严厉批评甚至处分；要求各级监察部门对地方各级政府在安置复员建设军人工作上的失职违法事件进行检查，并加以严肃处理。最近国务院又指示各部门由于精简机构、内部调剂而在执行安置复员建设军人工作决议发生问题的时候，应采取“归口包干”的安置办法。
    自从国务院的决议公布以来，人们满意地看到：高等教育部和教育部已经制定了关于妥善处理复员建设军人复学问题的规定，在教育系统中贯彻实施。吉林、湖南、四川、福建、河南等省的党政领导机关已经做了许多工作来贯彻国务院的决议。吉林省公安系统需要增加的人员已经决定全部从复员建设军人中录用。四川省的一些企业学校在招收学生和员工时，主动要求吸收复员建设军人。湖南省沅陵县有关单位认真检查了过去不重视安置复员建设军人的错误，各用人单位已经开始执行国务院的决议，主动要求在本单位安置复员建设军人，使这一工作向前推进了一步。辽宁省也表扬了认真安置复员军人的抚顺石油四厂和大连造船公司两个单位。这两个企业单位几年来不仅积极地吸收了复员建设军人和荣誉军人参加工作，并且全面地帮助他们提高政治和技术水平，适当地解决了他们生活上的困难问题，因而充分发挥了这些复员建设军人的政治积极性和生产积极性，推动和保证了生产任务的完成，并为国家培养了一批经济干部和技术人员。
    但是，现在仍然有许多部门和单位对国务院的决议还没有认真负责地贯彻执行。例如中央部门中的重工业部、商业部、铁道部和全国合作总社等部门有一些干部就是这样。他们既没有作出在本系统中安置复员军人的实施办法，也不积极支持地方的安置工作。这就使得一些地方的安置工作很难进行。各地迫切希望中央各部门迅速作出执行国务院决议的具体安排，但这些部门一直迟迟不作安排。
    有一些地区和单位的人事部门和劳动部门，对于国务院的决议甚至采取了各种抗拒态度。例如，浙江省人事局在浙江省交通电工器材公司需要增加二十名营业人员的时候，不仅没有把复员建设军人放在调配计划的第一位，而且在这个公司申请录用复员建设军人的时候拒不批准，以至这个公司一直不能录用复员建设军人。山西省劳动局对于安置复员建设军人也采取了敷衍推诿的恶劣态度。在国务院的决议公布以后，他们告诉山西省转业建设委员会说“没地方要人，复员军人安置不下去”；同时却批准阳泉矿务局招收新的工作人员。当阳泉矿务局在当地招收不足，请省劳动局协助的时候，他们还是不肯介绍复员军人去就业。他们一面继续欺骗转业建设委员会说“复员军人安置不下去”，一面仍要阳泉矿务局再回去招收。当转业建设委员会发现了这个情况，要求介绍复员建设军人去就业的时候，这个劳动局竟当面撒谎说：“阳泉矿务局已经招足了。”这个劳动局居然用这样的两面态度拒绝执行国务院的决议，这完全是目无法纪的行为。我们认为，山西省和浙江省的党政领导机关和监察机关有责任立即进行彻查和处理。
    对国务院的决议采取类似态度的，还有不少单位。例如，山东省商业厅需要增加数百名职员，但拒绝录用复员建设军人。武汉市工业局过去一贯拒绝录用复员军人，当武汉市委严厉批评了他们以后，他们录用了，但他们完全不按这些复员建设军人的能力和觉悟程度来分别分配工作，也不管他们的身体条件如何，一律分配到砖瓦工业处，砖瓦工业处又一律分配到砖瓦厂，砖瓦厂又一律分配去做推车工。工业局的人事科说：“愿干就干，不愿干就请回去，我们这里就是这样。” 他们这样做的目的，就是要逼着复员建设军人自动离职，而且确实有一些复员军人已经被迫离职了。这种对待中央决议的阳奉阴违态度，表示出这些机关沾染了国民党的恶劣作风。他们对待复员军人的态度，很像是地主资产阶级对待劳动人民的态度，这是我们国家的法律所绝对不能容忍的。
    为什么会发生这种恶劣现象呢？原因是多种多样的。我们以前已经批判过所谓“复员军人难领导”、“复员军人都有问题”等荒谬说法，现在我们再提供一个考虑问题的线索。山西省宁武县供销合作社不久以前要招用八十多名营业职员，县人民政府派员前去交涉，要他们录用四名条件适当的复员军人，这个供销合作社的秘书武子华竟拒绝录用。但是，这个供销社人事股长韩银芳的亲戚，供销社干部郑建华的爱人的弟弟，供销社干部王丙林的有神经病的儿子，也并不合于武子华所提的条件，却都不经任何考试而录用了，他们还长期雇用了一个刚取消管制的地主阶级分子和一个敌伪人员。很明显，武子华和韩银芳之流所以拒绝复员军人参加工作，乃是为了腾出空额来引用私人，把他们所管理的单位变成他们个人的天下，这就是事情的实质所在。但是，在山西日报已经揭发了这一事件以后，武子华和韩银芳仍然窃据着宁武县供销合作社的秘书和人事股长职位。这个供销社的上级机关和宁武县的党政领导机关和监察机关没彻查和处理这一事件，是很不应该的。
    复员建设军人，来自光荣的中国人民解放军，他们一般地（包括起义的和解放的人员）都经过革命战争的锻练和考验，虽然其中有少数人存在着居功骄傲等缺点，但一般说来，他们在政治上是忠实可靠的，有不少人还在人民革命和保卫祖国的事业中流过血，立过功，他们应该受到国家的关怀和照顾。复员军人中的一大部分人并且已经编入了人民解放军的预备役，他们将继续是我们国家的捍卫者。因此，一切党政组织和企业部门都应该把安置复员建设军人的工作看成是我国国防建设的重要组成部分，把复员建设军人看成是可靠的骨干和同志，给予经常的关怀和热情的帮助，使他们迅速提高政治、业务水平，在新的岗位上作出贡献。各级党委和政府都应该努力贯彻国务院的决议，并且对决议的执行情形进行认真的检查，严厉地批评以至处分那些对复员建设军人采取拒绝录用、歧视排斥和无理刁难态度的单位和个人，同时表扬那些认真负责执行国务院决议、成绩显著的单位和个人。必须这样，国务院的决议才能有效地贯彻下去。
