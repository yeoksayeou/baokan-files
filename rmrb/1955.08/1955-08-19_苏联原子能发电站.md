    Soviet Atomic Power Plant
    By Our Correspondent in Moscow, Li He

    The world's first atomic power plant, built by the Soviet Union, has been generating electricity for over a year since June 27th of last year. The 15 million kilowatt-hours of electricity generated during this period have been supplied to industrial and agricultural production and the needs of residents, along with the electricity generated by other power plants. On August 10th, Soviet newspapers detailed this atomic power plant. As Hiroshima residents suffer the disaster of the American atomic bomb on this tenth anniversary, and as people all over the world resolutely oppose atomic war and the use of atomic weapons, how can people not feel excited to recognize the Soviet Union's achievement in the peaceful use of atomic energy?

    The Atomic Power Plant of the Soviet Academy of Sciences is located in the Russian forest, a modest three-story building like a middle school. In the main hall there is a nuclear reactor, the central hub of the atomic power plant. The reactor is installed underground, behind a cast iron shield that protects people from radioactive radiation. It is a graphite cylinder three meters in diameter, sealed in a steel box. In the center are one hundred and twenty-eight channels, each with a seven-meter-long rod, inside which are steel pipes for water flow. At the bottom of the pipes are enriched uranium (containing five percent of isotope 235), which is the atomic fuel.

    A chain nuclear reaction is taking place in the reactor. The process is this: when the uranium nucleus splits, two or three neutrons appear. One of these neutrons collides with other uranium nuclei, is absorbed by the nucleus, and causes fission. The remaining neutrons either fly out of the reactor or are absorbed by uranium and other substances inside the reactor that have not undergone fission. Thus, the uranium nucleus fission process that has already begun continues to progress. The nuclei split into two parts in opposite directions at a speed of 10,000 kilometers per second, but they only move in a distance of one-thousandth of a millimeter. The split parts collide with other nuclei. The enormous energy of the split parts is transferred to many atoms of uranium. The uranium then heats up. Water flowing through the rods gets heat.

    The water that receives heat from the reactor does not turn into steam itself, but circulates in a closed circuit, which is the first circuit. This circuit is made of stainless steel pipes, which are connected to the nuclear reactor, circulating water pump, and steam generator. The water in the first circuit transfers heat to the water in the second circuit in the steam generator. The water in the second circuit turns into steam, and like a normal thermal power plant, uses steam power to rotate a 5,000-kilowatt turbine generator. The use of a secondary circuit is to prevent the water in the first circuit, which is contaminated with radioactivity, from flowing into the turbine. The water in the first circuit is at 100 atmospheres of pressure, so it is heated to 270 degrees without boiling (it needs 309 degrees to boil at such high pressure). The water in the second circuit is at 12.5 atmospheres of pressure, so it boils at nearly 200 degrees. In this way, the water in the first circuit boils the water in the second circuit and heats the resulting steam to 260 degrees, and then puts it into the turbine.

    The atomic power plant only needs 30 grams of uranium as fuel per day and night, while a thermal power plant with the same power output needs 120 tons of coal. On the back wall of the main hall of the atomic power plant hang the rods with the uranium installed, each rod having 170 centimeters of uranium at the bottom. The "fuel" stored here is enough for more than half a year. Before the uranium rods are put into the reactor, they are harmless and can be handled by hand. Thermal power stations have to add coal constantly. Here, uranium is added only once every one hundred days.

    The spent uranium rods are highly radioactive. When they are taken out of the reactor by a crane, the operator stands at a certain distance behind a half-meter-thick cast iron wall to operate. The wall is fitted with windows made of lead glass, through which the situation of taking the rods can be observed. The water flowing in the reactor is also radioactive, so the water pump is also installed behind a concrete shield.

    The station is controlled by the central control room. There are instruments controlling the work of the entire station. Two engineers are always on duty in the hall, one observing the physical process of the reactor and the other managing the power generation part.

    The power of the station is regulated by rods made of boron carbide, which readily eats up neutrons. If the boron carbide rods are placed in the reactor, they will begin to eat up neutrons, and the number of uranium nuclear fissions will decrease, and the power of the reactor will also decrease accordingly. If an accident occurs in the station, another batch of preventive rods automatically enters the reactor, stopping the chain reaction in six or seven hundredths of a second. The instrument panel in front of the duty engineer reports the condition of the rods in the reactor. To change the power of the reactor, he can press the button to raise or lower these boron carbide rods.

    This atomic power plant not only accumulates technical experience in the construction and use of such power plants for the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries aided by the Soviet Union, but also trains cadres. It is worth noting that most of the people working at this station are university graduates from 1952 to 1954.

    Now the Soviet Union is building atomic power plants with a capacity of 50,000 to 100,000 kilowatts and even larger. The construction of atomic power plants is a great victory for Soviet and human science and technology, and a great victory for the Soviet Union's commitment to peaceful endeavors.

    苏联原子能发电站
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    苏联建立的世界上第一个原子能发电站，从去年六月二十七日起已经发电一年多了。在这个时期所发的一千五百万瓩时电力，已经和其他发电厂所发的电力一起，供应了工农业生产和居民的需要。八月十日苏联各报都详细介绍了这个原子能发电站。当此广岛居民遭受美国原子弹的灾害十周年的时候，当此全世界人民坚决反对原子战争和反对使用原子武器的时候，人们怎能不怀着兴奋的心情来认识苏联和平利用原子能的这个成就啊。
    苏联科学院的原子能发电站设在俄罗斯森林中，是一座像中等学校一样的三层楼的朴素房子。在那里的主厅放着核子反应器，那是原子能发电站的中枢。反应器装在地下，在使人们不受放射性辐射的生铁护板后面。它是直径三公尺的密封在钢箱中的石墨圆柱。它的中央贯着一百二十八道，每道插着七公尺长的杆，杆内放着流水用的钢管。管的底部装着浓化铀（含有百分之五的同位素二三五），这就是原子燃料。
    在反应器内进行着连锁的核反应。它的过程是这样的：当铀的原子核分裂时，出现两三个中子。其中一个中子碰上铀的其他原子核，被核所吸而引起分裂。其余中子或者飞出反应器或者为反应器内没有分裂的铀和别的物质所吸。这样已开始的铀的原子核分裂过程不断继续着。核以每秒万公里的速度向相反的方向分裂为两部分，可是它们只在千分之一毫米的距离中运动。分裂的部分与别的核撞击。分裂部分的巨大能传给铀的许多原子。铀便发热了。流过杆内的水获得了热。
    从反应器传受热的水，本身不化为汽，在闭路内循环，这是第一次回路。这个回路是由不锈钢管构成的，这些钢管和核子反应器、循环水泵和蒸汽发生器相联接。第一次回路水在蒸汽发生器内传热给第二次回路的水。第二次回路的水化为汽，像平常热力发电站一样，以汽力转动五千瓩的透平发电机。采用二次回路，是为了防止染有放射性第一次回路的水流进透平。第一次回路的水是在一百大气压力下，所以加热到二百七十度而不沸腾（在这样高压下要三百零九度才沸腾）。在第二次回路的水是在十二点五的气压下所以近二百度时便沸腾了。这样，第一次回路的水使第二次回路的水沸腾并且把得到的蒸汽加热到二百六十度，然后放入透平。
    原子能发电站每昼夜只需三十克的铀作燃料，而同样发电力的热力发电站需用一百二十吨煤作燃料。在原子能发电站的主厅的后墙悬挂着装好铀的杆，每杆底部有一百七十厘米装着铀。这里储藏的“燃料”够用半年以上。当铀杆没有放进反应器以前是毫无危险的，可以用手拿它们。热电站要不断加煤。这里每一百天才加一次铀。
      用过的铀杆具有高度的放射性。用吊车从反应器内取出它们时，操作者站在一定距离在一个半公尺厚的生铁墙后面操作。在墙里装有铅玻璃做的窗子，透过这些窗子观察到取杆的情形。在反应器内流动的水也具有放射性，因此汲水的水泵也装在混凝土护板后面。
    这个站是由中央操纵厅管制的。那里有控制全站工作的仪器。在厅里经常有两个工程师服务，一个观察反应器的物理过程，另一个管理发电部分。
    站内能力是用极会吃掉中子的碳化硼做的杆来调节的。如果把碳化硼杆放进反应器，那末它会开始吃掉中子，而铀核分裂的数量就减少，反应器的能力也随着缩小。如果站内发生事故，另一批预防的杆自动地投入反应器，使连锁反应在六七十分之一秒的时间内停止。在值班工程师面前的仪器表报告着反应器内杆的状况。为了改变反应器的能力，他可以按下电纽，上下这些碳化硼杆。
    这个原子能发电站不仅为苏联和苏联援助的人民民主各国累积着建设和使用这类发电站的技术经验，而且培养着干部。值得注意的是，在这个站工作的大部分人员是一九五二年到一九五四年的大学毕业生。
    现在苏联在建筑五万到十万瓩和更大能力的原子能发电站。原子能发电站的建筑，是苏联和人类科学和技术的伟大胜利，是苏联致力于和平事业的伟大胜利。
