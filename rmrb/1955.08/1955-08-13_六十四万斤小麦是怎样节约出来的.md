How 640,000 Jin of Wheat Was Saved
    Wu Fangpu Zhou Jinxiu
    Beginning in the spring of this year, the local state-owned Beijing No. 2 Flour Mill launched a labor competition centered on saving grain. The goal of all employees was to further increase the wheat flour extraction rate for the country, thereby saving grain, while ensuring safe production and product quality. Through the efforts of the employees, from January to July of this year, the entire factory saved a total of 645,837 jin of wheat for the country.
    In the past, the employees of the Beijing No. 2 Flour Mill did not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of saving grain, and were skeptical about the possibility of saving grain in their factory. Some staff members believed: I am not involved in technical operations, saving grain is the workers' business. Some technicians believed: The current technical operations are old rules that have been in place for many years, and it is impossible to improve the machines and operating techniques, so a little waste is inevitable. Some workers believed: Our factory is large and well-established, with hundreds of thousands of jin of grain coming in and out every day, so it doesn't matter if a little grain is wasted. In addition, there was a fairly common departmentalism among the employees, namely that the factory was processing for other units, and even if grain was saved, it would not benefit the unit; if the power consumption increased due to the increased flour extraction rate, and the cost could not be reduced, wouldn't it be very uneconomical! Due to the influence of these erroneous ideas, many wasteful phenomena in the processing process in this factory could not be eliminated for a long time. In the workshop, flour was flying everywhere, and in the packing machine area alone, more than nine jin of good flour turned into soil flour (flour mixed with soil) every day. During processing, the flour contained in the bran was not cleaned properly, and it was estimated that more than 153,580 jin of wheat would be lost due to this in half a year. Due to the wheat beater breaking the wheat and the drying machine crushing the wheat, 65,630 jin of wheat were lost in half a year. In addition, wheat grains scattered on the ground could be seen everywhere in the yard. As for the phenomenon of not sweeping the wheat at the bottom of the stacks and on the wheat transport trucks, everyone paid even less attention to it. The wheat mixed in the sand from the wheat washing machine had already sprouted wheat seedlings on the ground, and people did not find it strange.
    In the labor competition to save grain, under the leadership of the Party organization and the Beijing Food Industry Company of the Grain Bureau, all employees of the Beijing No. 2 Flour Mill fought against these serious acts of wasting national grain. The factory held an exhibition against waste, and the factory director made a report to the employees, presented the facts, and made detailed calculations, so that all employees realized the great significance of opposing waste and saving grain. The porter Li Yongsheng said: "In the past, I thought it didn't matter if a little grain was wasted, who knew that this little bit accumulated to several thousand jin a year. It is not easy for farmers to produce grain, we are too wrong if we do not pay attention to saving grain!" After criticizing their own ideas of only focusing on completing production tasks and not paying attention to increasing the flour extraction rate, many employees actively joined the struggle against wasting grain. With the active efforts of all employees, the factory carried out a series of improvements in technology, equipment, and management. In terms of technology, the flour path was adjusted and the angle and slope of the grinding rollers were changed, which provided favorable conditions for increasing the flour extraction rate. In terms of equipment, some improvement methods were also devised, for example, by absorbing the experience of brother factories, the modification of the drying machine reduced the moisture content of clean wheat, and changed the situation where the flour extraction rate and flour output decreased every summer due to the high moisture content. In terms of management, the factory established a record system for replacing grinding rollers and a machine repair notification system, improved the ingredient organization and system, and also established a system for sweeping the bottom of the stacks and wheat transport trucks and emptying the sacks.
    Through several months of efforts, the flour extraction rate of the No. 2 Flour Mill has been increasing month by month. From January to July, a total of 645,837 jin of wheat were saved for the country due to the increase in the flour extraction rate, which is equivalent to 550,585 jin of flour.
    At present, there are still many problems in the production management of the Beijing No. 2 Flour Mill, such as the non-standard flour fineness, high power consumption, etc. All employees are determined to continue to work hard to overcome these shortcomings, so that on the one hand, they can produce high-quality and low-cost flour for the country, and on the other hand, they can save more grain for the country.

    六十四万斤小麦是怎样节约出来的
    吴芳圃　周锦秀
    从今年春季开始，地方国营北京市面粉二厂展开了以节约粮食为中心的劳动竞赛。全体职工的努力目标是：在保证安全生产、保证产品质量的前提下，进一步提高小麦出粉率，为国家节约粮食。经过职工的努力，从今年一月到七月，全厂共为国家节约了小麦六十四万五千八百三十七斤。
    过去，北京市面粉二厂的职工对节约粮食的重要意义认识不足，对自己工厂中节约粮食的可能性抱着怀疑态度。有的工作人员认为：自己不管技术操作，节约粮食是工人的事。有的技术人员认为：现在的技术操作，是多少年来的老规矩，机器和操作技术是不可能改进的，浪费一点是不可避免的。有些工人则认为：我们工厂家大业大，每天有几十万斤粮食进出，浪费点粮食没关系。另外，在职工中还有一种相当普遍的本位主义思想，就是认为本厂是给别的单位加工的，即使节约了粮食，对本单位也没有什么好处；如果因为提高出粉率而使耗电量增加，成本降低不了，这岂不是很不合算！由于这些错误思想的影响，这个工厂在加工过程中的许多浪费现象长时期不能消除。在车间里，面粉到处飞扬，仅打包机一处，每天就有九斤多好面变成了土面（混杂有土的面粉）。在加工中，麸皮上含有的面粉处理不净，估计半年中就要因此损失小麦十五万三千五百八十多斤。由于打麦机打碎麦子和甩干机刻碎麦子，半年中就损失小麦六万五千六百三十多斤。此外，院子里到处都能看到撒在地上的小麦粒。至于垛底的小麦和运麦大车上的小麦不扫净的现象，大家就更不去注意了。洗麦机出来的砂子里混杂的小麦已经在地上长出了麦苗，人们也并不觉得奇怪。
    在节约粮食的劳动竞赛中，北京市面粉二厂的全体职工在党组织和北京市粮食局食品工业公司的领导下，向这些严重浪费国家粮食的行为进行了斗争。工厂里举办了反对浪费展览会，厂长向职工作了报告，摆事实，算细账，使全体职工认识反对浪费和节约粮食的重大意义。搬运工李永生说：“过去我想浪费一点粮食算不了什么，谁知道这一点积累下来一年就是好几千斤。农民生产粮食不容易啊，我们不注意节约粮食是太不对了！”许多职工批判了自己的只管完成生产任务，不重视提高出粉率的思想以后，便积极地投入反对浪费粮食的斗争。在全体职工的积极努力下，工厂在技术、设备和管理方面都进行了一系列的改进。在技术方面，调整了粉路和改变了磨辊角度斜度，为提高出粉率提供了有利条件。在设备方面也想出了一些改进的办法，例如，吸收兄弟厂的经验，改装甩干机之后，就降低了净麦水分，改变了每逢夏季由于水分大而使出粉率和面粉产量降低的情况。在管理方面，工厂建立了磨辊的更换记录制度和机器检修通知单制度，健全了配料组织和制度，还建立了垛底和运麦大车要扫净、麻袋要倒净的制度。
    经过几个月来的努力，面粉二厂的出粉率逐月提高，从一月到七月，由于出粉率提高共给国家节约了小麦六十四万五千八百三十七斤，折合面粉五十五万零五百八十五斤。
    目前，北京市面粉二厂的生产管理还有不少问题，如面粉粗细度不合标准，耗电量高，等等。全厂职工决心继续努力来克服这些缺点，以便一方面为国家生产出质量好、成本低的面粉，一方面为国家节约更多的粮食。
