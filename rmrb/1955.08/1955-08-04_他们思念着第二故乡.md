    They Miss Their Second Hometown
    Wang Xi
    I have a letter received by the Chinese Trade Delegation to Japan in Tokyo. It was written by Nanzan Middle School in Ne?uto Village, Nagano Prefecture, Japan. Judging from the signature, it was written by a fourteen-year-old girl. Her neat and tidy Chinese characters are no worse than those of Chinese children of the same age. The letter contained the following words:
        We are people who have returned (from) China. We are
    from Yanshou County, Heilongjiang Province. We returned to
    Japan in 1953 to learn Japanese language and characters.
    Now we can (are able to) speak and write (are able to write).
    I still want to go to China to study.
        I am a student who was a member of the Chinese Young
    Pioneers. I received the red scarf in Tianjin and then
    they accepted it. I miss that red scarf very much now.
    After Japan has peace, please bring me the red
    scarf. This is my biggest wish.
        Also, when you come to Japan, please bring many
    Chinese books, so that Japanese people can learn Chinese
    language and characters, and go to China to see that good
    place in the future.
    This child, who grew up on Chinese soil, may have written this letter without the knowledge of her classmates and teachers. These few lines convey this childlike but sensible child's strong longing and desire for the country that once nurtured her.
    The Chinese delegation received countless Japanese expatriates who had lived in China and received countless letters in various parts of Japan. Among the last group of Japanese expatriates to return home was a doctor couple who, before returning to their hometown, first brought their children to thank the Chinese representatives.
    Some people, upon seeing the delegation, burst into tears as if seeing long-lost relatives.
    More than 30,000 expatriates have returned to Japan from our country. They once breathed the air of freedom in China, lived an equal life free from worries about food and clothing; many of them contributed their skills to the cause of China's economic recovery. Children grew into young people, cherishing the beautiful ideals that all young people have for the future; adults woke up from the lies of the "holy war" and understood the meaning of life; middle-aged people stepped into their old age, watching the growth of their children and grandchildren with comforting and joyful eyes...
    The Chinese people accepted their requests again, and assisted them in returning to their motherland like bidding farewell to friends going on a long journey. Even some people who had committed crimes were treated leniently. China—their second hometown—left them with infinite warmth and happy memories.
    Japanese expatriates living overseas have always yearned for the land and relatives of their motherland. But now, after stepping onto the shores of Japan, they feel that the motherland is strange and indifferent. Children are frightened by American soldiers as soon as they disembark, whispering to each other:
    "Look, American devils!" Girls wonder why they have to learn so many complicated etiquettes. New students who have finally entered the school ask: "Why do students mind their own business and no one helps anyone?"... Adult parents have even more troubles. Large factories and companies in Japan have received instructions to close their doors to people returning from China; Japan has a large unemployed population, and the road to employment for them is very narrow. Seventy percent of them have joined the ranks of the unemployed and underemployed.
    A person who used to be an engineer in a chemical plant in our country now has to sell his labor, and his son has to abandon his studies to work as a temporary cart pusher. The income and living standards of the few who are fortunate enough to find jobs cannot be compared with those when they lived in China. According to the Japanese government's "Household Survey," only families with a monthly income of more than 40,000 yen have the conditions to enjoy cultural and medical life; such families account for only 2% of all Japanese residents. How many of the repatriated Japanese can be among this "2%"?
    The American occupation forces do not let them live in peace either. An employee of the Japan-China Friendship Association told me that last year, the Repatriation Aid Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare, under the instruction of the US military, constantly sent some people to the US military headquarters to be interrogated by special personnel. The US military wanted to interrogate them for the information they needed. Those who refused to answer were given anesthesia and then tortured, and some were even electrocuted innocently. Only because of the angry protests of all the repatriated Japanese and all honest Japanese people, and the exposure of the truth in the Diet, did the re-enactment of similar atrocities stop. However, the persecution did not stop there, but changed to secret and milder methods. Except for a few people with ulterior motives, the repatriated Japanese refused all threats and enticements, and respected the friendship of the Chinese people towards them as they respected their own conscience. Many people voluntarily reported the persecution they had suffered to the Japan-China Friendship Association and the National Liaison Association of Chinese Returnees, and resisted it with united strength.
    Many repatriated Japanese did not abandon their ideals of life because of the hardships of life. They bravely joined the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, and freedom. The experience of living and working in China is precious to them. Film director Shoji Kimura, like many others, has written books introducing New China. His "New China" has sold nearly 10,000 copies. In the book, he describes his experiences in China and praises the life and thought of New China. In his creative life, he uses these life and thoughts that attract him as a guide for practice. When directing the film "River of Youth," in order to shape the image of Japanese workers, he went to various electrical industry labor unions to live with the workers and discuss his script with them. His work attitude and methods have been praised among progressive film workers in Japan. A medical doctor who used to be a professor at a medical school in our country, with his qualifications as a graduate of the former Imperial University of Japan, could have opened a hospital or obtained a professorship at some university. However, he refused such suggestions and chose to work in a clinic in the working-class area of ​​suburban Tokyo. He does not charge consultation fees for poor people, and instead asks the government to obtain "insurance benefits" according to the "Life Protection Law" on behalf of patients. In Japan, although the "Life Protection Law" is a written law, it is unknown how many twists and turns poor people have to go through to receive "insurance benefits" according to the law. Striving for "insurance benefits" has become a struggle related to the vital interests of the broad masses of people. This medical doctor sees patients at the clinic during the day and rushes around everywhere at night, promoting doctors to join hands and fight together for insurance benefits. Last autumn, Tokyo held a demonstration with 3,000 doctors participating, making a powerful appeal for "insurance" treatment for poor patients. It can be said that it was unprecedented in Japan for doctors to take to the streets in this way.
    An employee of the Japan Peace Committee also told me such a thing: In Akita Prefecture, there is a Japanese family who returned from China. The father has not yet found a job. Their child, a third-grade student who had studied in a Chinese school, is an active activist in collecting signatures against atomic weapons in the local area. Every day when the child comes home, he always says to his mother:
    "Oh no, today I met a few more 'poor people'." Once, twice, it attracted the mother's attention. She asked the child: "What are 'poor people'?" The child said: "Oh, those are the people who don't understand the sin of the atomic bomb yet!" The mother was moved by the child's innocence and enthusiasm, and went out to collect signatures with the child. The father, who was troubled by unemployment, became even more irritable after discovering the actions of the mother and son:
    "You are running around outside all day, collecting signatures for something, no wonder I can't find a job!"
    The son argued with his father, and the son said with confidence: "How does opposing the atomic bomb hinder you from finding a job? If the United States comes to fight an atomic war again, not to mention you can't find a job, all of our lives will not be guaranteed!" Then, the father also became an active member of collecting signatures in the local area.
    One of the responsible cadres of the Japan-China Friendship Association once talked to me about his experience of living in China. He had followed the Kwantung Army that invaded our country to China, and later became the oldest medical soldier in the Kwantung Army. When Japanese fascism collapsed, his thoughts became confused. A feeling of despair controlled him, and he felt that there was no way to live from then on. He stayed in China as a prisoner of war. The Chinese people were very lenient to him, let him stay, and accepted his request, allowing him to wear the uniform of the People's Liberation Army and work as a medical worker. Since then, seven years have passed. He described his experiences in these seven years to me bit by bit, and his eyes became moist. He said: "Thank the Liberation Army for giving me the opportunity to participate in the tempering of practical struggle. I have personally seen how the Japanese army trampled on the Chinese people, and I have also seen the Chinese people's great struggle to liberate themselves and their perseverance in rebuilding their lives." He said that it was not easy to transform his thoughts. It was precisely for this reason that he could not express the gratitude of the Chinese people who truly "liberated" him in words.
    "When I was preparing to return to China, I made up my mind to work hard for the development and consolidation of the friendship between the Japanese and Chinese people for the rest of my life."
    His wish came true. Like some of his compatriots who returned from China, they cherish the memory of their second hometown and have become the backbone of the Japan-China friendship movement. They made an agreement with such vows: We must make the flowers of Japan-China friendship bloom brilliantly all over the three islands of Japan.

    他们思念着第二故乡
    汪溪
    我手边保存了中国访日贸易代表团在东京接到的一封信。这是从日本长野县?阜村的南山中学写来的。从信的署名看，它出于一个十四岁小姑娘之笔。她那清晰整齐的中国字，并不比年龄相仿的中国孩子差些。信里面写着这样一些话：
        我们是在（从）中国回来的人。我们是黑
    龙江省延寿县的人。一九五三年回到日本国
    来，学日本国的话和字，现在也用（能）说也
    用（能）写啦。我现在还想要上中国去学习。
        我是中国少年先锋队员的一个学生。把红
    领巾拿到了天津市，以后给收下了。我现在很
    想那个红领巾。日本国和平以后，你们要把红
    领巾带给我。这是我最大的希望。
        另外，你们上日本国来时，请你们多多拿
    中国的本（书），样（让）日本国人民学中国
    话和字，将来上中国去看看那好地方。
    这个在中国土地上长大的孩子，也许是瞒过了她的同学和老师写这封信的。短短的几行话传达了这个童稚但是又很懂事的孩子对那个曾抚育过她的国家的强烈的怀念和想望。
    中国代表团在日本各地，接待了不知多少曾旅居过中国的日本侨民，接到过不知多少封来信。最后一批回国的日侨中，有一对医生夫妇，在没有回家乡以前，先领着孩子来向中国代表们致谢了。
    有的见了代表团的人，好像见了久别的亲人一样，涔涔落下泪来。
    从我国回到日本的侨民已有三万多人。他们曾经在中国呼吸过自由的空气，过着平等的不愁衣食的生活；他们中间许多人曾经在中国经济恢复的事业中贡献出了自己的技能。孩子们长成了青年，对前途怀着年轻人都有的美丽的理想；成年人从“圣战”的谎言里醒转过来，懂得了人生的意义；中年人迈进了晚年，用安慰和欣喜的眼光注视着自己的儿孙的成长……。
    中国人民又接受了他们的请求，像送别远行的朋友一样地协助他们回到了自己的祖国，就连一些曾经犯过罪的人，也得到了宽大的处理。中国——他们的第二故乡给他们留下了无限温暖和快乐的回忆。
    旅居在海外的日本侨民，对于祖国的风土和亲人曾是日思夜想的。但是，现在，踏上了日本的海岸之后，他们却感到祖国是陌生的，冷漠的。孩子们一下船就被美国兵吓着了，轻声地互相传告着：
  “看，美国鬼子！”姑娘们奇怪为什么要去学习那末多繁琐的礼节。好容易才踏进了校门的新学生发出疑问：“为什么同学们各管各，谁也不帮助谁？”……成年的家长们的烦恼更多了。日本的大工厂和大公司都接到指令，向从中国回来的人关上了门；日本有的是失业群，留给他们就业的路，实在是很窄了。他们之中，百分之七十的人已站进了失业和半失业者的队伍。
    曾在我国化工厂当过工程师的人，现在只有出卖体力，他的儿子也不得不抛弃学业去做临时的推车工。少数幸而找到了职业的人，他们的收入和家庭生活水平是无法同侨居中国时比拟的。据日本官方的“家计调查”说，只有月入四万元以上的家庭，才有享受文化和医药生活的条件；这样的家庭，在全日本居民中只占百分之二。能列身于这“百分之二”的归国日侨，能有几户呢？
    美国占领军更不让他们安宁。日中友好协会的一位工作人员告诉我：前年，日本厚生省遣返日侨援护局，曾奉美军指令，不断地把一些人送到美军司令部去，受特种工作人员的审问。美军要从他们口里，审问出他们需要的情报来。拒绝回答的，就被上了麻醉药以后加以拷问，有的更无辜地受了电刑。只由于所有的归国日侨，和一切正直的日本人的愤怒抗议，并在国会上揭发了真相，才制止了类似暴行的再演。但是，迫害并没有从此停止，只是改用了秘密的和较温和的方式。除了个别的别有用心的人以外，归国日侨们拒绝了一切威胁和利诱，像尊重自己的良心一样，尊重中国人民对他们的友情。许多人主动把自己受到过的迫害向日中友好协会和中国归国者全国联络会报告，用团结起来的力量加以抵制。
    许多归国日侨没有因为生活的苦难而抛弃掉生活的理想。他们勇敢地投入了日本人民为争取独立民主自由的斗争。在中国生活和工作的经验对他们是宝贵的。电影导演木村庄十二，像许多旁人一样，写过介绍新中国的书。他的“新中国”，发行了近万册。在书里，他叙述了自己在中国的经历，歌颂了新中国的生活和思想。在自己的创作生活里，他把这些吸引着他的生活和思想，作为实践的指针。在导演“青春之河”影片的时候，为了塑造日本工人的形象，他到各地电气产业劳动组合中去，同工人们生活在一起，又和工人们共同讨论他的剧本。他的工作态度和方法，在日本进步的电影工作者中，传为美谈。曾在我国某医学院当过教授的一位医学博士，以他曾毕业于前日本帝国大学的资历，是很可以开设医院或到什么大学去谋得教授职位的。但是，他拒绝了这样的建议，选择了东京市郊工人区的诊疗所的工作。贫苦的人看病不收诊费，而代病人向政府要求按“生活保护法”取得“保险费”。在日本，“生活保护法”虽是成文法令，但贫苦的人想依法领到“保险费”，真不知要经过多少周折和阻难。争取“保险费”更变成了关系着广大人民切身利益的斗争。这位医学博士白天在诊疗所看病，晚上就到处奔波，推动医生们携起手来，共同为争取保险费而斗争。去年秋天，东京举行了一次有三千个医生参加的示威游行，替贫苦病人争取“保险”待遇作了有力的呼吁。医生们这样地走出街头，在日本可以说是空前的。
    日本拥护和平委员会的工作人员也曾告诉我这样一件事：在秋田县有一户从中国回来的日侨。父亲还没有找到职业。他们的孩子，曾经在中国学校念过书的三年级的学生，是当地征集反对原子武器签名的积极活动者。孩子每天回家，总向母亲说：
  “糟糕，今天我又遇到几个‘可怜的人’。”一次，两次，引起了母亲的注意。她问孩子：“什么是‘可怜的人’？”孩子说：“啊呀，就是那些还不懂得原子弹的罪孽的人啊！”妈妈被孩子的天真和热情感动了，也跟孩子一起出去征集签名。正在失业的愁苦中的爸爸，发现母子二人的行动后，更加烦躁起来：
    “你们一天在外面乱跑，去征集什么签名，怪不得我老也找不到工作啊！”
    儿子和爸爸争论起来，儿子理直气壮：“反对原子弹怎样妨碍了你找职业？要是让美国再来打一次原子仗，不说你找不到职业，我们大家命都不保啊！”跟着，爸爸也成了当地征集签名的积极分子了。
    日中友好协会的负责干部之一曾同我谈过他旅居中国的情形。他曾经随着侵略我国的关东军到了中国，后来成了关东军中最老的卫生兵。当日本法西斯垮台的时候，他思想混乱起来。一种绝望的心情控制了他，他感到从此再没有生活的路了。他作为战俘留在中国。中国人民对他很宽大，让他留下来，并接受了他的请求，许他穿上了人民解放军的军服，作一名医务工作者。从那时起，经过了七个年头。他对我一段一段地叙述着他这七年的经历，他的眼睛湿润起来了。他说：“感谢解放军给我参加实际斗争生活的锻炼。我亲眼看到过日本军队怎样蹂躏中国人民，我也看到了中国人民解放自己的伟大斗争和重建生活的毅力。”他说，改造他的思想是不容易的。正是因为这个原因，中国人民真正地“解放”了他的恩情，他难以用言语传达。
  “我在准备回国时，就下了决心，愿终身为发展和巩固日中人民友好而努力。”
    他的心愿实现了。像其他一些从中国回去的他的同胞一样，他们怀着对第二故乡的思念，成了日中友好运动的骨干。他们以这样的誓言相约：一定使日中友好的花朵灿烂地开遍日本三岛。
