The New Face of Chengdu
　　Wang Yuchang
　　Chengdu, an ancient city with more than 2,000 years of history, is located in the center of the western Sichuan Plain, known as the "Land of Abundance." It is one of the transportation hubs in the interior of our motherland. Here, not only are there eight highways leading to Shaanxi, Xikang, and various parts of Sichuan, but it is also the meeting point of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, and the future Chengdu-Kunming Railway. After dredging the Fu River surrounding Chengdu, small steam turbines can directly reach Leshan and Yibin, and enter the Yangtze River.

　　In the midst of vigorous construction, Chengdu is developing from an old consumer city to an industrial city. At the Chengdu Railway Station, one can always see groups of porters and loaders unloading seamless steel pipes, drilling rigs, derricks, and thousands of tons of steel bars and cement from newly arrived trains. New factories are being built in the urban area. The newly built thermal power plant, mechanized brick and tile factory, and the large-scale Chengdu Railway Locomotive Repair Factory have all been put into production. The original Chengdu Machinery Factory, Qianjin Iron Factory, and other old enterprises have also produced many new products after renovation, including Soviet-style four-sided planing beds, large band saws, and double-wheeled double-share plows and double-wheeled single-share plows for rural areas. In 1955, the total output value of local industry in the city will increase by 66% compared to 1951. With the development of industrial construction, the urban population has also doubled compared to the early days of liberation.

　　"Uneven roads and dim lights" was the portrayal of old Chengdu. In recent years, great efforts have been made in municipal construction, which has changed the old face. The main roads have been widened, and the road surface has been improved. Many small streets have also been renovated. In five years, the total length of renovated roads in the city reached 97 kilometers. Some streets have also been added with street flower beds or nurseries, planted with rows of phoenix trees or hibiscus trees. In the past, due to too few street lights, the elderly were often injured and children fell at night; now, the city's street lights have tripled compared to the time of liberation. From 1950 to 1954, the government built more than 77,000 square meters of new housing for workers and other working people, enabling more than 3,000 working people to move from dilapidated houses into sunny new houses. In the past slum of "Huangcheng Ba," the garbage that had accumulated for many years and formed a "coal mountain" was cleared, and it has now been rebuilt into a wide People's Stadium.

　　Since the Qin Dynasty, Chengdu has been famous for its developed silk industry, and the famous "Shu Brocade" has been praised at home and abroad. The city currently has more than 80 handicraft industries, with more than 2,000 kinds of products and more than 13,000 kinds of colors and patterns. In addition to daily necessities, handicraft workers also produce a lot of building materials. For example, many bridge iron parts for the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway and the Kangzang Highway were undertaken by the Chengdu iron industry.

　　Now the city has seven universities and thirty middle schools, including primary schools, there are nearly 70,000 students. Eighty percent of primary school students are children of workers and peasants.

　　Chengdu has a very warm climate, no sandstorms, and is a green city all year round; whether in winter or summer, the suburbs and parks are lush green. Almost every courtyard in the city is planted with flowers, plants and fruit trees, as well as exquisite bonsai. There are also many picturesque parks and historical sites in the urban area. Thousands of tourists come to the People's Park, Du Fu Thatched Cottage Memorial Hall, Baihuatan, Wangjianglou Park, Wuhou Temple and Nanjiao Park every day. (Attached picture)

　　成都的新面貌
　　王焴长
    成都，这个有两千多年历史的古城，位置在号称“天府之国”的四川西部平原的中央，它是祖国内地的交通枢纽之一，在这里，不仅有八条公路通向陕西、西康和四川各地，而且是成渝铁路、宝成铁路和未来的成昆铁路的汇合点。环绕成都的府河疏浚后，小汽轮可直达乐山、宜宾，驶入长江。
    在蓬蓬勃勃的建设中，成都正由一个旧的消费城市向工业城市发展。在成都火车站上，随时可以看到成群的搬运、装卸工人，从新到的列车上卸下无缝钢管、钻探机、井架和千百吨的钢筋、水泥。市区内正在兴建新的工厂。新建的火电厂、机制砖瓦厂、规模宏大的成都铁路机车修理厂等都已投入了生产。原来的成都机械厂、前进铁工厂等旧企业，经过改造后，也已经生产出不少新产品，其中有苏式四面刨木床、大型排锯和供应农村的双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁等。一九五五年全市地方工业总产值将比一九五一年增加百分之六十六。随着工业建设的发展，市区人口也比解放初期增加了一倍。
      “马路不平，电灯不明”是旧日成都的写照。近年来经大力进行市政建设，已改变了旧的面貌。主要道路都加宽了，路面也改进了。许多小街道也已经翻修。五年中，全市翻修的路面总长达九十七公里。有的街道还添上了街心花坛或苗圃，栽种了成行的梧桐或芙蓉树。过去，由于街灯太少，晚间时常发生跌伤老人、摔倒小孩的事；现在，全市街灯比临解放时增加了三倍。从一九五○年到一九五四年，政府给工人和其他劳动人民新修的住宅，面积有七万七千多平方公尺，使三千多户劳动人民从破烂的屋子搬进阳光充足的新屋。在过去的贫民窟
  “皇城坝”的侧边，多年堆积下来形成“煤山”的垃圾被清除了，现已改修成宽阔的人民体育场。
    从秦代起，成都就以蚕丝业发达著称，著名的
  “蜀锦”载誉中外。全市现有手工业八十多个业别，产品多到两千多种，花色一万三千多种。除了日用品外，手工业者还生产不少建筑用材，例如修筑宝成铁路和康藏公路的许多桥梁铁件，就是由成都市铁作业承造的。
    现在全市有高等学校七所，中学三十所，连小学在内有近七万学生。小学生中百分之八十都是工农子弟。
    成都气候十分温暖，没有风沙，是一座四季长绿城；不管冬天夏天，市郊和公园里都是一片葱绿。市内的每一座院落，差不多都种有花草果树，还有精致的盆景。市区内还有许多绮丽如画的公园和名胜古迹。每日有成千的游人来到人民公园、杜甫草堂纪念馆、百花潭、望江楼公园、武侯祠和南郊公园游玩。（附图片）
