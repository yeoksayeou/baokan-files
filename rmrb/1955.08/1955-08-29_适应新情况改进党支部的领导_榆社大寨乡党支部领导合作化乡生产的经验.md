    Adapting to New Situations and Improving Party Branch Leadership
　　——The Experience of the Yushe Dazhai Township Party Branch in Leading the Cooperative's Township Production
    How the Party's grassroots organizations in rural areas can adapt to the new situation of the cooperative movement and strengthen the party's leadership in the production of the whole township is a new issue that needs to be studied and resolved. The experience of the Dazhai Township Party Branch in Yushe County in leading the cooperative's township production provides a preliminary experience in solving this problem.
    The agricultural production cooperatives in Dazhai Township, Yushe County, have greatly developed in this year's spring cooperative movement. The number of households participating in agricultural production cooperatives in the township has increased from 252 last year to 771, accounting for 96 percent of the total 802 farm households in the township. This new situation of township-wide cooperation has posed a series of new problems to the Party branch that urgently need to be resolved: such as how to enhance the Party's core leadership role in agricultural cooperatives ideologically and organizationally? How to ensure that cooperatives can continuously increase production and continuously consolidate and improve, etc. When these issues were discussed at the branch committee meeting, Yang Liangsheng, the deputy secretary of the general branch with rich leadership experience and who had served as a member of the Party branch committee for 17 years, said: "Relying solely on the old leadership methods, without new methods, we will lag behind the demands of the masses!"
    The Dazhai Township branch correctly analyzed the new situation and problems, and under the correct guidance of the higher-level Party committee and the active efforts of all Party members, organized the first spring plowing production campaign after the township's cooperation better than any previous year, and initially gained some experience:
      1. Change leadership thinking and adjust organizational strength
    Dazhai Township belongs to ten natural villages, including Dazhai, Zhoucun, and Tianjiagou. Among them, five villages established cooperatives very early, and five full-time county and district cooperative workers were stationed there year-round. The leadership strength of the Party general branch was not fully transferred to the agricultural cooperatives. This year, all ten villages in the township have agricultural cooperatives, but the number of resident township workers has been reduced to one. The heavy responsibility of leading the ten cooperatives in the township to do a good job in production will mainly be borne by the Party branch. In this situation, some Party members and cadres developed a harmful sentiment, believing that as long as farmers join the cooperative, they will "turn without pushing the millstone," and it will be fine without strengthening the Party's leadership. For example, Pei Buwei, a Party member in Ouni'ao, was very active in leading mutual aid groups in the past, but this year he relaxed his efforts as soon as he joined the cooperative. He said: "Farmers joining the cooperative saves our Party members a layer of trouble; whoever doesn't do enough workdays in the cooperative won't get food, so they will produce well without leading them." In response to these ideas, at the beginning of spring plowing, the Party branch organized all Party members to carefully study and discuss the "Resolution on the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives" and related materials of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Many Party members reviewed their various incorrect understandings of agricultural cooperatives in the past. Deputy Township Chief Zhang Qianliu said: "I thought that with the township's cooperation, production work would be done by the cooperatives, and it would be fine without leadership." Party member Bai Weijiang said:
  "I used to think that leading cooperatives was the business of the main township cadres, and it was enough for me to be a good cooperative member." After discussion and criticism, it was finally clearly proposed that "the entire branch should run cooperatives and ensure that all cooperatives increase production."
    On the basis of raising ideological awareness, organizational adjustments were made: the past method of establishing Party organizations by region was changed, and it was decided to establish Party branches or groups according to agricultural cooperatives and labor groups, and implement a contract responsibility system. Two of the thirteen general branch committee members serve as directors of supply and marketing and credit cooperatives, and the remaining members are responsible for leading a cooperative on a contract basis; each branch committee member or group leader is responsible for a major task in the cooperative; two or three Party members are responsible for leading a labor group. After the internal Party organization was adjusted, and after democratic discussions among the members, several cooperative directors and committee members who were incompetent and lost the trust of the members were replaced. After these ideological and organizational work by the Party branch, its leadership role was greatly strengthened. Of the 48 Party members in the township, except for four Party members such as Zhang Yongjin who were not highly conscious and whose work was still not active, the other nine Party members such as Yang Liangrong who were originally not active also became active; those who were always active in the past are now even more active. Under the strong leadership of the Party branch, great achievements have been made in spring plowing, sowing, fertilizer accumulation, moisture conservation, and water conservancy construction throughout the township.
    2. Implement the policy of voluntary participation and mutual benefit
    In the cooperative movement, Dazhai Township generally implemented the Party's policy of voluntary participation and mutual benefit. However, in the process of handling the means of production and production investment of cooperative households, there were also some small deviations in the specific economic interests of poor and middle peasants. The Party branch combined production and conducted an education on the unity of poor and middle peasants for all members, explaining the importance of implementing the policy of mutual benefit, and specifically corrected the deviations. For example, the Ouni'ao cooperative set the price of hiring members' livestock too low. Each team of livestock (two heads) was paid only 90 cents for plowing two mu of land per day; these two heads of livestock had to eat 80 cents worth of fodder a day, plus feeding costs and self-provided farm tools, so the livestock owner felt at a loss. When harrowing the land and conserving moisture was tense, eight households including cooperative member Pei Ziwei proposed to sell their livestock. After the policy was implemented, the hiring price was increased to 1.2 yuan, which increased the members' enthusiasm for raising livestock. None of the original eight households that wanted to sell their livestock sold them, and two more households bought two donkeys according to the needs of the cooperative. The Tianjiagou cooperative used the large farm tools owned by old middle peasants such as Tian Yulin without compensation. Tian Xin was dissatisfied but dared not say so, and made excuses to withdraw from the cooperative. After correction, reasonable depreciation fees for large farm tools were stipulated, and policy publicity was carried out. The thinking of these households was stabilized. Tian Yulin said: "Running a cooperative is a new thing, and it is inevitable that there will be shortcomings when it is first established. I said I wanted to withdraw from the cooperative before, mainly because I was indecisive."
    In implementing the policy of mutual benefit, the Party branch also mobilized poor and middle peasant members to use the method of mutual borrowing and exchange to solve the difficulties in the spring plowing of insufficient feed and production investment according to the needs of production. The whole township adjusted about 10,000 jin of food, feed, and seeds. In addition, the Party branch also regularly paid attention to cultivating poor peasant backbones. In the spring plowing production, twelve poor peasant members with prestige among the members were elected by everyone to take on the leadership work of the cooperative. The unity of poor and middle peasants and the thorough implementation of policies stimulated the production enthusiasm of the majority of members. Since the beginning of spring, the cooperatives in the township have invested in buying 75 calves and 28 large plowing cattle. Many members have also built houses and added small farm tools. Under the close unity of poor and middle peasants, the cooperative exposed the sabotage activities of class enemies. Four rich peasant elements and enemy and puppet military officers who had mixed into the cooperative were removed from the cooperative, ensuring the purity of the cooperative.
    3. Give play to the role of the cooperative network and let the old cooperatives drive the new cooperatives
    Of the ten cooperatives in the township, half are old and half are new, and all cooperatives have some work that needs to be strengthened with specific leadership. Based on this situation, the Party general branch used and gave play to the role of the cooperative network, with the Hongguang Cooperative in Dazhai Village as the core of the cooperative network, regularly exchanged experiences, and used points to promote the whole area. In addition, it was decided that an old cooperative would lead a new cooperative to strengthen daily specific assistance.
    The Party general branch grasped the three major links of labor management, technology management, and financial management according to the common problems of each cooperative, and conducted specific leadership through the cooperative network. The first was to organize a labor management research group, composed of cooperative directors and some group leaders, focusing on studying and solving problems such as leadership methods, production plan arrangements, and contracting quotas. Through the cooperative network, the experience of Zhang Shoupeng, the leader of the labor group of the Hongguang Cooperative, was promoted, enabling the 23 group leaders of the five new cooperatives to learn the short-term arrangement of farm work and solve the problems of production chaos and wasted work. The second was to organize a technical research group, including technical committee members and group technicians from each cooperative, responsible for imparting technical experience and promoting new creations. For example, in land improvement, the method of "soil not going down the slope and water not coming out of the ditch" of the Hongguang Cooperative was promoted, changing the past "digging side slopes and spreading dikes" to "building dikes on the edges of fields." Using methods such as practical teaching and technical demonstrations, 37 farm tool masters in the township were helped to master the technology of using double-wheeled double-furrow plows. The third was to organize an accounting research group. In addition to learning to use new bookkeeping, it also helped new cooperatives solve the problem of chaotic procedures for work recorders and accountants. In addition to regularly gathering to exchange experiences through the cooperative network, each research group also often used the "you come and I go" method to organize new and old cooperatives to solve problems with each other. When Xima Village promoted "three fixes" contracting, it had been unable to do so for more than 20 days, forming a chaotic situation of "the cooperative director being busy, the group leader watching, and the members going out to find cash." Later, veterans from the Hongguang Cooperative were invited to give specific assistance and impart experience before the problem was solved.
    The Party general branch also paid attention to organizing labor competitions through the cooperative network, and launched a vertical and horizontal interlocking competition movement centered on the cooperatives and based on the labor groups, to ensure the general balance of production in each cooperative. In order to avoid formalism in the competition and the excessively long evaluation time, it was decided to use each small section of the production plan as the content and the standard of three-fixes contracting as the condition for the competition; and to adopt methods such as summarizing by each cooperative, concentrating in the whole township, and key observation to achieve the purpose of mutual promotion. From the perspective of the three consecutive competition climaxes organized in the spring plowing, the labor efficiency of the new and old cooperatives has been greatly improved. In the 14-day competition of the ten cooperatives in the township, the original plan was to invest 50,400 workdays, but only 42,500 workdays were used to complete the task.
    The Party general branch also paid attention to strengthening the political and ideological leadership of each cooperative through the propaganda network, and improving the awareness of the vast number of members. In the spring plowing production, the Party general branch organized a propaganda army of more than 300 Party and Communist Youth League members, propagandists, and activists in the township, often going deep into the fields and groups, using various forms to publicize the Party's various policies and advanced figures and advanced ideas, enlivening the political atmosphere in the countryside. The Party general branch regularly listened to the propaganda members' reflections on the ideological situation of the members and the masses, and helped the propaganda members solve difficult problems in their work.
    Due to the above measures, the leadership of the Party branch has been greatly improved in the new situation of township-wide cooperation. A new atmosphere of unity and production has emerged in the township.

    适应新情况改进党支部的领导
　　——榆社大寨乡党支部领导合作化乡生产的经验
    党的农村基层组织如何适应合作化运动发展的新情况，加强全乡的生产领导，是一个需要研究解决的新问题。榆社大寨乡党支部领导合作化乡进行生产的经过，提供了解决这一问题的初步经验。
    榆社县大寨乡的农业生产合作社，在今年春季的合作化运动中有很大发展，全乡参加农业生产合作社的户数由去年的二百五十二户发展到了七百七十一户，占全乡总农户八百零二户的百分之九十六。这种全乡合作化的新局面，给党支部提出了一系列迫切需要解决的新问题：如怎样从思想上组织上增强党对农业合作社的核心领导作用？如何保证合作社能不断增产不断巩固提高等。在支委会上讨论这些问题的时候，富有领导经验、做过十七年党支部委员的总支副书记杨良生说：“光凭老一套的领导，没有新办法，我们就要落在群众要求的后面了！”
    大寨乡支部正确分析了新的情况和问题，在上级党委正确指导和全体党员的积极努力下，把全乡合作化后的第一个春耕生产运动组织得比以往任何一年都好，并初步取得了一些经验：
      一、转变领导思想，调整组织力量
    大寨乡所属大寨、周村、田家沟等十个自然村，其中有五个很早就办了社，常年驻着五个县区专职办社工作人员，党总支的领导力量并没完全转到农业合作社方面来；今年全乡十个村都有了农业合作社，驻乡工作人员却减少到了一个，领导全乡十个社搞好生产的重担，主要就要由党支部来承担。在这种情况下，部分党员干部中，产生了一种有害的情绪，他们认为农民只要入了社，就会“磨不推自转”，不用加强党的领导也能行。如沤泥凹党员裴补维，过去领导互助组很积极，今年一进社就松下劲来，他说：“农民一入社就给咱党员省去一层麻烦；到社里谁做不下劳动日，谁就分不到粮食，不用领导他也会好好生产。”针对着这些思想，在春耕开始时，党支部组织全体党员认真学习并讨论了中共中央“关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”和有关材料，许多党员检查了以往对农业合作社的各种不正确的认识。副乡长张千六说：“我想全乡合作化了，生产工作有社搞，不用领导也能弄好。”党员白维江说：
  “我以前认为领导合作社是乡主要干部的事情，自己当个好社员就行了。”经过讨论批判，最后一致明确提出：“全支部人人办社，保证社社增产”的口号。
    在提高思想认识的基础上，进行了组织调整：改变过去按地区建立党组织的办法，决定按农业合作社和劳动小组建立党的分支或小组，实行包干负责领导制。十三个总支委员，有两个担任供销和信用合作社主任，其余每人包干领导一个社；每个分支委员或小组长负责合作社里一项主要工作；两三个党员负责带动一个劳动小组。党内组织调整后，又经过社员民主讨论，改换了几个力不胜任、在社员中失去信任的社长和社务委员。党支部经过这些思想和组织工作之后，领导作用大大加强了。全乡四十八个党员，除张永金等四个觉悟不高的党员工作仍不积极外，其他杨亮荣等九个原来不够积极的党员也积极起来了；过去一贯积极的现在更积极了。全乡在党支部的有力领导下，春耕播种、积肥、保墒、兴修水利等都做出很大成绩。
    二、贯彻自愿互利政策
    大寨乡在合作化运动中，一般是贯彻了党的自愿互利政策的。但在处理入社农户的生产资料和生产投资的过程中，对贫农中农间的具体经济利益照顾也有些小小的偏差。党支部就结合生产向全体社员进行了一次贫、中农团结的教育，说明贯彻互利政策的重要，并具体进行纠正。如沤泥凹社，对社员耕畜雇用价格定的太低，每犋（两头）牲口一天耕二亩地只给九角钱；这两头牲口一天就得吃价值八角的草料，再加上饲养费工和自备农具，畜主就觉得吃亏。到耙地保墒正紧张时，社员裴自维等八户都提出要卖牲口。经过贯彻政策，把雇价提高到一元二角，社员养畜积极性提高，原来八户要卖牲口的一头也没卖，又有两户根据社内需要买下了两头驴。田家沟社无代价用老中农田余林等几户私有的大农具，田心中不满又不敢说，找借口提出退社。经过纠正，合理规定了大农具折旧费，进行了政策宣传，这几户思想稳定了，田余林说：“办社是件新事，才办难免没缺点，以前说想退社，主要怪自己二心不定。”
    在贯彻互利政策中，党支部同时又根据生产需要，发动贫、中农社员用互借互换办法，解决了春耕中饲料不足和生产投资上的困难问题。全乡互相调剂了食粮、饲料和种子约一万多斤。此外，党支部并经常注意培养贫农骨干。在春耕生产中，有十二个在社员中有威信的贫农社员，被大家推举担任了社的领导工作。贫农中农的团结和政策的深入贯彻，激发了广大社员的生产积极性。入春以来，全乡各社仅吸收社员投资即买下小牛七十五头，社员自买大耕牛二十八头。不少社员还修建了房屋，添置了小农具。在贫农中农亲密团结的情况下，社里揭露了阶级敌人的破坏活动，四户混进社来的富农分子和敌伪军官被清除出社，保障了社的纯洁。
    三、发挥合作网的作用，以老社带动新社
    全乡十个社，新老各半，各社都有一些工作需要加强具体领导。根据这种情况，党总支运用和发挥了合作网的作用，以大寨村红光社为合作网的核心，定期交流经验，以点推动面。此外并确定一老社带一新社，加强日常的具体帮助。
    党总支根据各社的普遍问题，抓紧劳动管理、技术管理、财务管理三大环节，通过合作网分类进行具体领导。首先是组织劳动管理研究组，由各社长和部分组长组成，着重研究和解决领导方法、生产计划安排、包工定额等问题。经过合作网推广了红光社张寿朋领导劳动小组的经验，使五个新社的二十三个小组长，学会了农活的短安排，解决了生产混乱和窝工问题。其次是组织技术研究组，包括各社技术委员和小组技术员，负责传授技术经验推广新的创造。如在修整土地中，推广了红光社的“土不下坡、水不出沟”的办法，改变过去“刨边摊堰”为“堎边打堰”。以实习传授和技术表演等办法，帮助全乡三十七个农具手掌握了使用双轮双铧犁的技术。再就是组织会计研究组，除学习使用新式簿记外，还帮助新社解决了记工员和会计的手续混乱问题。各研究组除通过合作网定期集会交流经验外，还经常以“你来我去”办法，组织新老社互相来往解决问题。西马村推行“三定”包工时，二十多天一直包不下去，形成“社长忙、组长看、社员出外抓现钱”的混乱局面。后来请红光老社骨干去具体帮助，传授经验，才解决了这个问题。
    党总支并注意通过合作网组织劳动竞赛，开展了以社为中心、以劳动小组为单位的纵横联环的竞赛运动，保证各社生产的大体平衡。为避免竞赛中的形式主义和评比时间过长，确定以每小段生产计划为内容，以三定包工的标准为条件进行竞赛；并采取各社总结、全乡集中、重点观摩等办法，达到互相推动的目的。从春耕中组织的连续三次的竞赛高潮来看，新老社劳动效率都有很大提高。全乡十社十四天竞赛中，原计划投工五万零四百个，结果只用了四万二千五百个劳动日即完成了任务。
    党总支还注意通过宣传网，经常加强对各社的政治思想领导，提高广大社员的觉悟。在春耕生产中，党总支组织了全乡党、团员、宣传员和积极分子共三百多人的宣传大军，经常深入田间、小组，运用各种形式，宣传党的各项政策和先进人物、先进思想，活跃了农村的政治空气。党总支经常听取宣传员对社员群众思想情况反映，帮助宣传员解决工作中的疑难问题。
    由于采取上述各项措施，党支部的领导在全乡合作化的新形势下大大提高了一步。全乡出现了团结生产的新气象。
