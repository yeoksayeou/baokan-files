    Conservation of Grain by Urban Residents in Tonghua Prefecture

    Jilin Province's Tonghua Prefecture has achieved great success in rectifying the urban grain unified sales work. The entire prefecture plans to save more than 10,000 tons of grain for the state from March to October. Among them, Tonghua City and County alone can save 5,000 tons. Tonghua Prefecture's conservation work started from the following aspects:

    In the past, the prefecture's urban grain supply adopted a uniform average supply method. Grain was supplied to those who should not have been supplied, and more grain was supplied to those who should have received less. The Tonghua Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Tonghua Prefectural Commissioner's Office successively convened meetings of county magistrates and grain bureau chiefs. After rectifying the grain unified sales work, grain budget systems were universally established in various agencies, organizations, and enterprises, eliminating the phenomenon of falsely reporting, fraudulently claiming, and wasting grain.

    Secondly, grain processing was improved to increase the rice yield. Grain processing factories in various counties universally launched labor competitions with the main goal of increasing the rice yield. For example, after the local state-owned Tonghua City Grain Processing Factory improved its operating methods, the sorghum rice yield reached 84%, an increase of 10% compared to the past. The rice yield reached 74.3%, an increase of 14.3% compared to the past. Calculated based on the annual processing task, this can save the state 400 tons of grain.

    Thirdly, the actual population in urban areas was further verified, and reasonable supply was implemented, greatly reducing grain sales.

### 通化专区城镇居民节约粮食

    通化专区城镇居民节约粮食
    吉林省通化专区整顿城镇粮食统销工作获得巨大成绩，全专区从三月份到十月份，计划可为国家节约一万余吨粮食，其中仅通化市、县就可节约五千吨。通化专区节约工作是从以下几个方面着手的：
    过去专区城镇粮食供应，一律采取平均供应的办法，不应该供应的供应了，应该少供应的多供应了。中共通化地委和通化专署先后召开了各县县长、粮食局长会议，整顿粮食统销工作后，各机关、团体、企业部门中普遍建立粮食预决算制度，杜绝了虚报、冒领、浪费粮食的现象。
    其次改善了粮食加工、提高出米率。各县粮米加工厂，以提高出米率为主要内容，普遍展开了劳动竞赛。如地方国营通化市粮谷加工厂改进操作方法后，高粱出米率达到百分之八十四，比过去提高百分之十；稻子出米率达到百分之七十四点三，比过去提高百分之十四点三。按全年加工任务计算，可为国家节约四百吨粮食。
    第三，在城镇居民中进一步核对了实际人口，进行合理供应，大量缩减了粮食销售量。
