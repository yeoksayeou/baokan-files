Strengthening Exchanges in Chinese and Japanese Woodcut Art
    Li Hua

    The "Japanese Woodcut Exhibition" sponsored by the Chinese Artists Association has opened.

    Japanese woodcut art has its own excellent traditions. During the height of the Tokugawa culture in the 19th century, the famous "Ukiyo-e" prints depicting social customs and people's lives emerged. Today's Japanese woodcut art inherits and develops this realist tradition, becoming an art form that truthfully reflects the thoughts and feelings of the people and widely plays a role in social education. From the works exhibited this time, we see the miserable lives of the Japanese people under American military occupation, the pain, struggle, and hope of the Japanese people, hear the voices of the Japanese people, and see the ugly faces of the American imperialists, the enemy of the Japanese people. At the same time, we also see that Japanese woodcut art is prominently at the forefront of current progressive art in Japan, playing an active and combative role in the revolutionary struggle to win independence, democracy, freedom, liberation, and to oppose wars of aggression and defend world peace.

    Now let us take a look at the works exhibited this time:

    Japan is a country that has suffered from atomic bomb disasters. Ueno Makoto's "Complaint of Atomic Disease Victims" is not only a complaint of a certain atomic disease patient, but a complaint of all Japanese people living under the threat of atomic bombs. These kind Japanese people have experienced in their suffering that in order to ensure the happiness of mankind, wars must be opposed, and the people of the world must be required to take the disasters suffered by the Japanese people as a warning and actively rise up to defend peace. This is a great political struggle.

    However, nine years after the first atomic bomb fell on Hiroshima, in March 1954, the United States again tested hydrogen bombs in the Pacific Ocean, and the Japanese people suffered again. The fishing boat Fifth Fukuryu Maru was damaged by hydrogen bomb radiation, and the fisherman Kuboyama was sacrificed. This series of disasters aroused widespread anger among the Japanese people. Ueno Makoto's "Fifth Fukuryu Maru", "Sending Fishing Boats to Sea", Niikura Kōji's "Sending Dad to Sea to Fish", "The Disaster of American Hydrogen Bomb Testing" and Murakami Yoshio's "Deserted Fishing Beach", "What I Saw at the May Day Festival in 1954" and other paintings fully express the Japanese people's hatred of American aggressors and their opposition to atomic weapons. In these works, we hear the magnificent and just voice of the Japanese people.

    With American imperialists establishing military bases everywhere, the disasters suffered by the Japanese people are profound. Niikura Kōji's "Stray Bullet" truthfully depicts an inhumane tragedy. The lives of farmers living near American military bases are not guaranteed, and American soldiers' live ammunition shooting can use every Japanese person as a target. Look, two children of four or five years old were killed and injured by stray bullets. Innocent and pure children have become victims of the aggressors. We see how moving are the emotions of grief and hatred revealed in the eyes and corners of the mouths of the characters carved by the artist. Suzuki Kenji's "At the American Military Base" depicts how the Japanese people, having taken action, angrily pulled out the sign that said "No Japanese Allowed" and the posts of the barbed wire. Kotsukiji Hisashi's "Oppose the Establishment of a Military Base in Uchinada" depicts the Japanese people's tenacious and persistent "sit-in" struggle against the American occupation forces. These works not only clearly show the faces of the enemy, but also vividly show the heroic actions of the patriotic Japanese people.

    From the experience of various struggles, the Japanese people deeply know that in order to obtain freedom and happiness, they must first eliminate war and strive for lasting peace. Therefore, the peace movement has been universally launched in all strata of Japanese society. Yui Shoji's "Peace Signature Campaign Goes to the Countryside" and Murakami Yoshio's "Women Promoting in the Streets" show that whether in rural or urban areas, enthusiastic young men and women are active for the peace movement, becoming an invincible force supporting the struggle. However, under American military occupation, the cause of striving for peace is arduous, and the peace movement is persecuted everywhere. Murakami Yoshio's "Wounded Peace Dove" depicts a dove with its wings spread, with a bloody wound on one wing, pointing out to the Japanese people how to take special care of this wounded peace dove. This meaning is profound.

    The Japanese people, experiencing all kinds of suffering, look at New China with hopeful eyes. They especially feel the loveliness of New China after liberation. New China has become their ideal, giving them great spiritual comfort and encouragement. This pure feeling is expressed in Koguchi Ichiro's "Talking About New China" and Kobayashi Kiko's "Fantasy of May Day," the latter depicting children dancing happily on May Day. Like New China, the happy life of children being able to celebrate May Day has aroused many sweet fantasies among the Japanese people. Try comparing Suzuki Kenji's "The Procession Occupied the People's Square" with this one, and it is not difficult to understand the Japanese people's yearning for New China.

    Niikura Kōji and Takizawa Niro's collaborative long serial woodcut "Don't Forget Hanamaki" is a creation with realism and struggle. This set of serial woodcuts uses a very powerful 56 pictures to movingly express the indomitable fighting spirit and friendship of the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese people against militarism. Each picture is clear and concise in black and white, and the vividness of the characters and the genuineness of the emotions leave a deep impression after seeing them. This is a very successful work of art, and it also has great significance for the cause of uniting the world's progressive humanity against war and defending peace.

    Among the works exhibited this time, there are also many colored landscapes and decorative woodcuts, such as Maekawa Senpan's "Factory Zone" and "Landscape," which have harmonious tones and cleverly interspersed color blocks, with simple and unadorned characteristics. Hiratsuka Un'ichi's "Moonlit Night" uses a large block of dark blue sky, contrasting with the white house nearby, to express the quiet and deep mood of the night, which is very poetic. Sekino Jun'ichiro's "Bridge" has bright and lovely colors. Azechi Umetaro's "Bullfight" is a concise and powerful colored woodcut. Maeda Masao's "Akamon" very refinedly uses calm color blocks to express
a quaint national building, rich in Japanese color. Onchi Koshiro's "Street" is a genre painting with a strong sense of life. Ozaki Seiji's "Horse" and "Autumn" are both very interesting. In addition, the decorative woodcuts by Yamaguchi Susumu, Takeda Takeo and others have elegant colors and are very exquisite. Asahi Masahide's "Camellia" and Morikubo Shun's "Mantis" are also delightful works. The art reproductions carefully carved by Japanese folk artists based on the painter's original works, that is, the so-called "craft woodblock prints," demonstrate the artistic creative genius and wisdom of the Japanese working people. All these Japanese woodcut color techniques are very clever. They inherited the multi-color printing technology of "Ukiyo-e" and developed it in the application of colors. This point is worth praising.

    Japanese woodcut art has a common feature in the expressive methods of woodcut art, that is, simplicity, conciseness, roughness, and strength. Different from the fine carving and meticulous engraving of ancient woodcuts, modern Japanese woodcuts, whether it is a knife or a line, the author considers the characteristics of woodcuts. We see on the screen a variety of knife techniques, creating an expressive effect that cannot be achieved by brush strokes. Japanese woodcut artists do not use sharp triangular knives to carve complex parallel lines like Western woodcut artists, but prefer to use large round-mouth knives to carve many free and unrestrained lines, which are expressed as color blocks with black and white contrast. Contrary to the intaglio tone of Western woodcuts, the tone of Japanese woodcuts is basically cameo, which is basically the same as Chinese woodcuts. Therefore, the picture is clear, the image is prominent, and it is close to the tradition of Eastern art. For example, Ueno Makoto and Niikura Kōji's collaborative "Water" and Ueno Makoto's "Disabled Person" completely omit the background and only use large blocks of black and white to express, making the main image particularly refined and powerful. Japanese woodcut artists prefer to use shallow knives to shave wood, so that the black and white changes printed out appear soft, avoiding the dryness and astringency that often occurs when using sharp knives to carve hardwood. In addition, in places with light tones, they like to use the method of scraping wood, so that the broken fibers print out irregular, broken spots. These expressive methods are unique to Japanese woodcuts.

    From these works, we also noticed the achievements of Japanese woodcut artists in character portrayal. In Niikura Kōji's "Stray Bullet," the angry expressions on the faces of the suffering parents are subtle and detailed. The characters in Ueno Makoto's "Complaint of Atomic Disease Victims" are full of sympathy, and the fighters in Suzuki Kenji's "The Procession Occupied the People's Square" are all lively and active on paper. The success of the character portrayal in these works is due to the author's deep understanding of life, not from conceptualizing and fabricating characters, so they can delicately appreciate the thoughts and feelings of the characters. There is no affectation, and they can deeply infect every audience.

    International cultural exchange is an effective means to promote the rapid improvement of human culture and strive for lasting world peace. We hope that the exchange of woodcut art between China and Japan will be more frequent and extensive in the future, which will help the growth of friendship between the two peoples and the development of woodcut art in both countries.

    加强中日木刻艺术的交流
    李桦
    中国美术家协会主办的“日本木刻展览会”开幕了。
    日本木刻有着自己优良的传统。在十九世纪德川文化高潮时期，就产生了描写世态人情、人民生活的有名的“浮世绘”版画。今天的日本木刻就是继承和发展了这种现实主义的传统，成为真实地反映人民的思想感情、广泛地发挥社会教育作用的一种艺术。从这次展出的作品中，我们看到日本人民在美国军事占领下的悲惨生活，看到日本人民的痛苦、斗争和希望，听到日本人民的呼声，看到日本人民的敌人美国帝国主义者的丑恶嘴脸，同时也看到日本木刻在日本当前的进步美术中，突出地走在前头，在争取独立、民主、自由、解放，以及反对侵略战争、保卫世界和平的革命斗争中发挥着积极的战斗作用。
    现在让我们来看看这次展出的作品：
    日本是身受原子弹灾害的国家。上野诚的“原子病害者的控诉”，不仅是某一原子病患者的控诉，而是生活在原子弹威胁下的所有日本人民的控诉。这些善良的日本人民，在身受的灾难中体验到：要保障人类的幸福必须反对战争，要求世界人民以日本人民所受的灾难为鉴戒，积极起来保卫和平。这是一个伟大的政治斗争。
    但在第一个原子弹落在广岛后的九年，即一九五四年的三月，美国又在太平洋上试验氢弹了，直接受难的又是日本人民。渔船第五福龙丸被氢弹的放射线所损害，渔民久保山牺牲了，这一连串的灾难，激起了日本人民普遍的愤怒。上野诚的“第五福龙丸”、“送渔船出海”，新居广治的“送爸爸出海打渔”、“美国试验氢弹的灾害”和村上芳夫的“冷落的鱼滩”、“一九五四年五一节所见”等画幅，充分地表现了日本人民痛恨美国侵略者和反对原子武器的心情。在这些作品中，我们听到了日本人民雄壮的正义呼声。
    在美国帝国主义到处建立军事基地的情况下，日本人民所受到的灾难是深重的。新居广治的“流弹”，真实地描写出一幅惨无人道的悲剧。住在美国军事基地附近的农民的生命是得不到保障的，美国兵的实弹射击可以用每个日本人做肉靶子。请看，两个四、五岁的孩子被流弹打死和打伤了。天真纯洁的孩子，竟做了侵略者的牺牲品。我们看到艺术家刻划出来的人物，那眼晴里、嘴角上所流露的悲愤痛恨的感情，是多么动人。铃木贤二的“在美军基地”，描写了行动起来的日本人民如何愤怒地拔去“不许日本人入内”的牌子和铁丝网的柱子。小溪住久的“反对在内滩建立军事基地”，描写了日本人民坚韧而顽强地向美国占领军进行“坐地”斗争。这些作品，不仅清楚地表现了敌人的嘴脸，而且鲜明地表现了日本人民爱国的英勇的行动。
    从种种斗争的经验中，日本人民深知要获得自由和幸福，首先要消灭战争，争取持久和平，因此和平运动在日本社会各阶层普遍地展开了。油井正次的“和平签名下乡”、村上芳夫的“在街头宣传的妇女”，表现了不论在农村或城市，热情的青年男女都在为和平运动活跃着，成为支持战斗的一种不可战胜的力量。然而在美国军事占领下争取和平的事业是艰苦的，和平运动处处受到迫害。村上芳夫的“受伤的和平鸽”，描写张翅起飞的鸽子的翅膀有一道渗出鲜血的伤痕，这给日本人民指出：要怎样加意爱护这只受伤的和平鸽子，这意义是深刻的。
    经历着万般苦难的日本人民，用希望的眼睛看着新中国，他们特别感到解放后的新中国的可爱。新中国已成为他们的理想，在精神上给他们极大的安慰和鼓舞。这种纯真的心情表现在小口一郎的“谈新中国”和小林喜已子的“五一节的幻想”上，后者描写孩子们在五一节欢乐舞蹈的场面，像新中国那样，孩子们能够欢度五一节的幸福生活，勾起了日本人民许多甜蜜的幻想。试把铃木贤二的“游行队伍占领了人民广场”那幅画同这一幅对照起来看，日本人民这种向往新中国的心情便不难理解了。
    新居广治、泷平二郎合作的长篇连环木刻“不要忘记花冈”，是具有现实性和斗争性的创作。这套连环木刻，用非常有力的五十六个画面，动人地表达了中国、朝鲜和日本人民在一起反对军国主义的不屈不挠的战斗精神和在战斗中的友谊。每个画面都黑白清晰而简洁，人物的生动和感情的真切，使人看过后留着深刻的印象。这是一套在艺术上很成功的作品，对于世界进步人类团结起来反对战争、保卫和平的事业，也具有很大的意义。
    这次展出的作品中，还有不少套色的风景和装饰木刻，如前川千帆的“工厂地带”和“风景”，色调和谐，色块穿插巧妙，具有单纯质朴的特色。平冢运一的“月夜”，以大块深蓝色的天空，和近处白屋对比，表现出寂静深沉的夜的情调，很有诗意。关野准一郎的“桥”，套色灿烂可爱。畦地梅太郎的“斗牛”，是一幅简练有力的套色木刻。前田政雄的“赤门”，很洗炼地用沉着的色块表现了
  一座古色古香的民族建筑，富有日本色彩。恩地孝四郎的“街头”，是一幅生活气息很浓厚的风俗画。尾崎清次的“马”和“秋”，都极富情趣。此外，山口进、武田武雄等的装饰木刻，套色雅致，都十分精美。旭正秀的“山茶花”和守洞春的“螳螂”，也是令人喜爱的作品。日本民间艺人根据画家的原作精心刻制的美术复制品，即所谓“工艺木版画”，表现了日本劳动人民的艺术创造的天才和智慧。所有这些日本木刻的套色技巧都是很高明的，他们继承了“浮世绘”的套印技术，而在色彩的运用上加以发挥，这点是值得推崇的。
    日本木刻在木刻艺术的表现方法上有一个普遍特点，就是朴素、简练、粗豪、有力。同古代木刻那种精刻细镂不同，现代的日本木刻，无论一刀一线，作者都考虑到木刻的特性。我们在画面上看到千变万化的刀法，造成一种非笔画可以达到的表现效果。日本木刻家不像西洋木刻家那样运用尖锐的三棱刀刻出复杂的平行线，却喜用粗大的圆口刀刻出很多自由奔放的线条，表现成为黑白对比的色块。同西洋木刻的阴刻基调相反，日本木刻的基调是阳刻的，这种表现法同中国木刻基本上是相同的。因此画面明朗，形象突出，而接近东方艺术的传统。如上野诚和新居广治合作的“水”和上野诚的“病残者”，背景完全省略，只用大块黑白来表现，主体形象格外表现得洗炼而有力。日本木刻家更喜欢用浅刀削木，使印出来黑白变化显得柔软，免除用尖刀刻硬木常会产生的干枯生涩的毛病。另外浅调子的地方，又喜用刮木的方法，使被刮破的纤维印出不规则的破碎的斑痕。这些表现方法是日本木刻所特有的。
    从这些作品中，我们又注意到日本木刻家对于人物刻划方面的成就。新居广治的“流弹”，那受难的父母们脸部的愤怒表情是细致入微的。上野诚的“原子病害者的控诉”中的人物是充满同情心的，铃木贤二的“游行队伍占领了人民广场”中的战斗者都生龙活虎似地活跃在纸上。这些作品上人物刻划之所以成功，是由于作者深刻地了解生活，不是从概念去虚构人物，所以能细腻地体会人物的思想感情，没有装腔作势的毛病，能深深地感染每个观众。
    国际间的文化交流是促进人类文化的迅速提高和争取世界持久和平的有效手段。我们希望今后中日两国木刻艺术的交流更为频繁和广泛，这对于两国人民的友谊的增长和两国木刻艺术的发展都是有帮助的。
