    The renovation project of the first and second inclined shafts of the Taiji Mine of the Beipiao Coal Mine, one of the 694 industrial construction projects above the quota during the First Five-Year Plan period, commenced on the 24th. The purpose of the renovation is to enable these two pairs of inclined shafts, which were originally nearing the end of their coal extraction, to once again produce a large amount of coking coal for the country.
    This renovation project is being carried out underground without hindering production, thus posing more construction difficulties. Before construction, the construction personnel made full preparations and determined the method of "renovating while producing," striving to complete the renovation on time in 1957.
    The coal produced by the Taiji Mine of the Beipiao Coal Mine is the coking coal needed by the iron and steel industry. The first and second inclined shafts of the Taiji Mine were built before liberation, and the equipment capacity of the inclined shafts could only reach 200 meters underground. The coal above this level has been mined for nearly 20 years and is nearing depletion. After geological exploration in recent years, it has been discovered that the Taiji Mine still has many minable coal seams at a depth of more than 200 meters, so it is necessary to renovate these two pairs of inclined shafts.

### 北票煤矿台吉矿改建两斜井

    北票煤矿台吉矿改建两斜井
    属于第一个五年计划期间六百九十四项限额以上的工业建设工程之一的北票煤矿台吉矿第一、第二斜井改建工程，已在二十四日动工。改建的目的，是使这两对原来快要采完煤的斜井能够重新给国家生产出大量的炼焦煤。
    这项改建工程是在不妨碍生产的情况下在井下施工的，因此施工困难较多。施工人员在施工前曾作了充分准备，确定了“边生产、边改建”的办法，争取在一九五七年按时改建完成。
    北票煤矿台吉矿出产的煤是钢铁工业所需要的炼焦煤。台吉矿第一、第二两对斜井在解放以前就已兴建，斜井的设备能力只能采到井下二百公尺，在这个水平以上的煤已经采了近二十年，快要采完。经过最近几年来的地质勘探，发现台吉矿在二百公尺以下的深部仍然蕴藏有很多可采的煤层，因此需要改建这两对斜井。（新华社）
