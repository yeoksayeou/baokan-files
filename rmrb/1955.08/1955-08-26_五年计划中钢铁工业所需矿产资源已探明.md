Xinhua News Agency, August 25th: The mineral resources required for the new and rebuilt iron and steel industrial enterprises during the First Five-Year Plan have been basically proven. The geological prospecting personnel who are prospecting for iron ore and auxiliary materials for the steel industry, except for a small number who are still continuing to prospect for the resources needed for the First Five-Year Plan, have mostly begun to search for and prospect for the mineral resources needed for the development of the steel industry in the Second Five-Year Plan.

China's large-scale steel industry resource exploration work began in 1953. Over the past two years, geological prospecting personnel have explored the resource conditions of many iron ore mines in Northeast, North China, Central South, and East China. The iron ore that has been clearly explored is sufficient to guarantee the needs of the development of the steel industry during the First Five-Year Plan. Auxiliary materials and fluxes such as refractory clay, silica, magnesite, limestone, and fluorite, which are indispensable for steelmaking, have also been basically found. The resource conditions of these iron ore and other mining areas that have been prospected are generally superior and suitable for the development of the steel industry. Near the Anshan Iron and Steel Base, not only are the iron ore reserves far exceeding historical estimates, but also all kinds of auxiliary materials needed for ironmaking and steelmaking are available, and transportation conditions are also very convenient. The iron ore proved in the Daye and Baotou areas is not only large in reserves and concentrated in ore deposits, but also high in iron content, possessing good conditions for the establishment of Wuhan and Baotou iron and steel joint enterprises. The proven reserves of iron ore near the Benxi Iron and Steel Company can also meet the long-term production needs of this iron and steel industrial enterprise. At the same time, according to existing data, in addition to what has already been proven near these large iron and steel industrial enterprises, it is also possible to prospect for more iron ore reserves.

The scale of steel industry construction during the First Five-Year Plan is very large, so the resource exploration task is also very arduous. Over the past two years, geological prospecting personnel have overcome various difficulties in the process of basically completing the steel industry resource exploration task. Now, the geological prospecting personnel have written detailed geological summaries of the underground resources in the mining areas they have prospected and submitted them to the higher authorities for the design departments to design mine construction.

### 五年计划中钢铁工业所需矿产资源已探明

　　五年计划中钢铁工业所需矿产资源已探明
    新华社二十五日讯　第一个五年计划期间开始新建和改建的钢铁工业企业所需要的矿产资源，已经基本上探明。勘探铁矿和钢铁工业辅助材料的地质勘探人员，目前除了少数仍在继续勘探第一个五年计划所需的资源外，绝大部分人员已开始在寻找和勘探第二个五年计划发展钢铁工业所需的矿产资源。
    我国大规模的钢铁工业资源勘探工作是从一九五三年开始的。两年多来，地质勘探人员在东北、华北、中南、华东等地区探明了许多个铁矿的资源情况。已勘探清楚的铁矿，足可保证第一个五年计划期间发展钢铁工业的需要。炼制钢铁所不可缺少的耐火粘土、矽石、镁石、石灰石、萤石等辅助材料和熔剂，也已基本上找到。勘探过的这些铁矿等矿区的资源条件一般都较优越，适合于钢铁工业的发展。在鞍山钢铁基地附近，不但铁矿石储量远远超过了历史上的估计，而且炼铁炼钢所需要的各种辅助材料也应有尽有，运输条件也很方便。在大冶和包头两个地区所探明的铁矿，不但储量大、矿床集中，而且矿石的含铁成分高，具备着建立武汉和包头的钢铁联合企业的良好条件。本溪钢铁公司附近的铁矿已经探明的储量，也可满足这个钢铁工业企业长期的生产需要。同时，根据现有资料看，这些大的钢铁工业企业附近除了已经探明的以外，还有可能勘探出更多的铁矿储量。
    第一个五年计划期间钢铁工业建设规模十分浩大，因此资源勘探任务也很艰巨。两年多来地质勘探人员在基本上完成钢铁工业资源勘探任务的过程中，是克服了种种困难的。现在，地质勘探人员们已把所勘探过的矿区的地下资源的详细情况写成了地质总结，送交上级给设计部门进行矿山建设的设计。
