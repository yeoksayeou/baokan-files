Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 4th: The Lao political conference continued on July 20th and 25th.

At these two meetings, the Lao Fighting Units put forward the following suggestions on the issue of general elections:

	I. Demand that free general elections be held nationwide with the participation of the Lao Fighting Units. The people in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly, as well as the people in the other ten provinces, including anti-resistance personnel, should have the right to participate in the general elections and the right to participate in the organizations supervising the general elections.

	II. Certain clauses in the election law must be supplemented and revised. It is suggested that male and female citizens over the age of eighteen, including monks and students, should have the right to vote; voting should be conducted in a secret and direct manner; representatives of all parties and representatives of the International Commission should participate in the organization supervising the general election; any citizen over the age of twenty-five who can read and write should have the right to be elected; the certificates issued by the Lao Fighting Units and the certificates issued by the Royal Government shall have the same effect.

	III. The Royal Government should accept applications from anti-resistance personnel to participate in the election and shall not refuse to accept them in any way.

At the meeting on the 20th, the delegation of the Royal Government of Laos unreasonably stated that the International Commission had no right to supervise the general election in Laos and demanded that the Lao Fighting Units "surrender." However, the Lao Fighting Units repeatedly and sincerely put forward specific suggestions, and in the suggestions, they once again expressed their recognition of the supreme power of the Royal Government in order to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Lao issue. At the meeting on the 25th, the Royal Government finally expressed "gratitude for the sincerity of the Lao Fighting Units," and believed that the issues such as the participation of the International Commission in supervising the election organization and the recognition of the validity of the certificates issued by the Lao Fighting Units could be resolved. However, on fundamental issues such as the revision of the election law, the Royal Government shirked its responsibility by claiming that it needed to be discussed and decided by the National Assembly, attempting to circumvent the responsibility that the issue of free general elections must be jointly negotiated and resolved by both parties through political conferences.

At the meeting on the 25th, the Lao Fighting Units protested against the statement made by Royal Government Prime Minister Katay Don Sasorith on July 19th, which attempted to prevent the Lao Fighting Units from participating in the national general election.

    老挝政治会议继续进行
    寮国战斗部队方面就普选问题提出建议
    新华社河内四日电　老挝政治会议在七月二十日、二十五日继续进行。
    在这两次会议上，寮国战斗部队方面就普选问题提出了如下建议：
    一、要求在全国范围内举行有寮国战斗部队参加的自由普选，在桑怒、丰沙里两省以及在其他十省的人民包括抗战人员在内，都应当有权利参加普选，有权利参加监督普选的机构。
    二、必须补充修改选举法中的某些条款。建议十八岁以上的男女公民包括僧侣、学生在内都有选举权；投票要采取秘密的和直接的方式；监督普选的机构应有各党派的代表以及国际委员会代表参加；任何二十五岁以上的能识字、写字的公民都有被选举权；寮国战斗部队方面发的证件和王国政府发的具有同等效力。
    三、王国政府应当接受抗战人员参加选举的申请书，不得以任何方式拒绝接受。
    二十日会议上，老挝王国政府代表团，曾经无理地提出国际委员会无权监督老挝的普选，并要寮国战斗部队方面“投降”。但是，寮国战斗部队方面一再诚恳地提出具体建议，并且在建议中又一次表示承认王国政府的最高权力，以争取老挝问题的和平解决。二十五日会议上，王国政府方面终于表示“感谢寮国战斗部队方面的诚意”，认为国际委员会参加监督选举的组织以及承认寮国战斗部队所发证件的效力等问题都有解决的可能。但是，对于修改选举法等根本问题，王国政府方面推脱需要由国民议会讨论决定，企图规避自由普选问题必须由双方通过政治会议来共同协商解决的责任。
    在二十五日会议上，寮国战斗部队对王国政府首相克特七月十九日发表的企图不让寮国战斗部队参加全国普选的声明，提出了抗议。
