    The New Homes by Ai Ling Lake
    Xu Zhonghai
    In July, I went to Ai Ling Lake in Shaobo District, Jiangdu County, Jiangsu Province, to visit the immigrants who had recently settled here. They originally lived in Xinhua, Fengchan, Huayuan, Xiaozhuzhuang and other villages downstream of Shaobo Lake in Jiangdu County. During the extraordinary flood of the Huai River in 1954, these villages blocked the flood, preventing it from quickly entering the Yangtze River, and threatening the safety of the people in the Lixiahe area. After the Jiangdu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Jiangdu County People's Government explained the principle of subordinating small interests to large interests to the masses in these villages, they happily moved. This April, led by Communist Party members Jiang Shoulong, Chen Rudong, and Communist Youth League member Wang Jiaying, they collectively moved to the edge of Ai Ling Lake in the Lixiahe area and rebuilt their homes.
    A total of 386 households have moved to the edge of Ai Ling Lake, and they have formed the Ai Ling Agricultural Producers' Cooperative here. When they moved, the People's Government issued them 100,000 yuan in relocation expenses, allocated more than 5,000 mu of public land for their long-term use, and helped them build new homes. The masses near Ai Ling Lake also voluntarily gave them more than 100 mu of cultivated land on the滩边 (tan bian - shore/mudflat) to show their welcome. The state-owned Yangzhou and Yizheng Farms sent workers to operate two tractors to help them reclaim land; the state-owned Jiangdu County Pumping Station also transported four water pumps to help them pump water for irrigation. More than 4,000 civilian workers from Huangjue, Huaishu, and Fanchuan districts even brought their own tools to assist them in building a dike to prevent outside water from attacking. These assistances further inspired the immigrants' enthusiasm for labor. The farmers who originally lived by Ai Ling Lake planned to reclaim 1,600 mu of land and plant 1,200 mu of seedlings. As a result of everyone's enthusiastic labor, they reclaimed more than 2,000 mu of land and planted more than 1,800 mu of seedlings.

    艾菱湖边的新人家
    徐中海
    七月间，我到江苏省江都县邵伯区的艾菱湖边，访问了新近才在这里安居的移民。他们原来住在江都县邵伯湖下游的新华、丰产、花园、小朱庄等村。一九五四年淮河发生特大洪水时，这几个村子挡住了洪水，使它不能迅速入江，威胁着里下河地区人民的安全。中共江都县委和江都县人民政府向这几个村的群众讲清了小利服从大利的道理后，他们愉快地搬了家。今年四月间，在共产党员姜寿龙、陈如栋、青年团员王家英等的带动下，集体迁移到里下河地区的艾菱湖边上，重建了家园。
    迁移到艾菱湖边的人家，共有三百八十六户，在这里，他们已组成了一个艾菱农业生产合作社。迁移时，人民政府曾发给他们十万元搬家费，并拨了五千多亩公地，给他们长期使用，帮助他们建立新的家园。艾菱湖附近的群众也自动将自家在滩边垦熟的一百多亩田送给他们，表示欢迎。国营扬州、仪征农场又派工人开来两台拖拉机帮助他们开垦；国营江都县抽水机站也运来了四部抽水机替他们抽水灌田。黄珏、槐泗、樊川等区四千多个民工，还自带工具协助他们筑了一条圩埂，防止外水袭击。这些援助，更加鼓舞了移民们的劳动热情。原住艾菱湖边的农民，计划开垦一千六百亩田，栽一千二百亩秧，由于大家热情地劳动，结果开垦了二千多亩田，栽了一千八百多亩秧。
