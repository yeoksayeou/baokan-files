Xinhua News Agency, 7th August – The 16th National Student Congress of the All-China Students' Federation concluded on August 6th.

    During the congress, Chen Yi, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a political report to the delegates. Yang Yingjie, Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission, gave a report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy. Zeng Zhaolun, Deputy Minister of Higher Education, delivered a report on current issues in higher education. Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, gave a report on strengthening students' political and ideological education. These reports clearly pointed out the direction of efforts for students nationwide, providing tremendous education and encouragement to all delegates.

    The congress held a thorough discussion of the work report of the 15th Executive Committee of the All-China Students' Federation and unanimously approved the report. The congress called on students nationwide, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to continue to implement Chairman Mao's instruction to "have a good body, study well, and work well," and to cultivate themselves into comprehensively developed builders of socialism who possess a high degree of socialist consciousness, can master modern scientific knowledge, and are physically healthy. The congress focused on the issue of further raising students' political and ideological awareness, urging all students to diligently study Marxism-Leninism and current affairs and policies; widely participate in socio-political activities; establish a firm working-class stance and a communist worldview; and currently, in particular, to actively participate in the struggle to eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all hidden counter-revolutionaries; strengthen their labor perspective and labor experience, and extensively cultivate a revolutionary style of hard work and plain living.

    The congress discussed the organizational issues of the All-China Students' Federation and school student unions, and revised the Constitution of the All-China Students' Federation. The congress believes that the work of school student unions should continue to be strengthened, and its regular tasks are to promote students' hard work in studying, organize students to participate in socio-political activities, carry out cultural and sports activities, and care for students' lives and welfare. In carrying out its work, it should obtain the leadership and support of the school's Party and administration and the close assistance of the Youth League.

    The congress believes that in order to adapt to the current actual situation, the organizational members of the All-China Students' Federation should be changed. From now on, the All-China Students' Federation will directly absorb the student unions of various colleges and universities as group members. Middle school student unions will carry out their work directly under the leadership of the school Party and administration and with the assistance of the Youth League organization, and will no longer be members of the All-China Students' Federation. Because middle school students are younger, many of their activities require the guidance of school administration and teachers; there are many middle schools, and they are relatively dispersed, and the All-China Students' Federation cannot directly contact so many units; at present, the leadership of the school Party and administration has been strengthened, and the organization and work of the Youth League and Young Pioneers have a considerable foundation; therefore, this change is practical. In the future, joint activities between various middle school student unions will be organized by the leading organs of the Youth League at all levels.

    On the afternoon of the 6th, the congress elected the 16th Committee of the All-China Students' Federation and adopted a message of respect to Chairman Mao. Then, the congress declared its closing.

    Zhou Enlai, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and Premier of the State Council, received all the delegates to the 16th National Student Congress of the All-China Students' Federation on the afternoon of the 7th and took a group photo with all the delegates. Chen Yi, Xi Zhongxun, Lin Feng, and Liu Lantao were present at the reception.

    全国学生第十六届代表大会闭幕
    新华社七日讯　中华全国学生第十六届代表大会在八月六日闭幕。
    大会期间，中国共产党中央委员、国务院副总理陈毅向代表们作了政治报告，国家计划委员会副主任杨英杰作了关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告，高等教育部副部长曾昭抡作了关于当前高等教育问题的报告，中国新民主主义青年团中央书记处书记胡耀邦作了关于加强学生的政治思想教育的报告。这些报告明确地指出了全国学生的努力方向，给全体代表以极大的教育和鼓舞。
    大会对中华全国学生联合会第十五届执行委员会的工作报告进行了充分的讨论，并一致同意这个报告。大会号召全国同学在中国共产党的领导下，继续贯彻毛主席的“身体好、学习好、工作好”的指示，把自己培养成为具有高度社会主义觉悟、能够掌握现代科学知识、身体健康的全面发展的社会主义建设者。大会着重讨论了进一步提高学生的政治思想觉悟问题，要求全体同学努力学习马克思列宁主义，学习时事政策；广泛参加社会政治活动，树立坚定的工人阶级立场和共产主义的世界观，在目前特别要积极参加肃清胡风反革命集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子的斗争；加强劳动观点和劳动锻炼，广泛地培养艰苦奋斗的革命作风。
    大会讨论了全国学联和学校学生会的组织问题，修订了中华全国学生联合会章程。大会认为：学校学生会的工作应当继续加强，它的经常任务是推动学生努力学习，组织学生参加社会政治活动，开展文化和体育活动，关心学生的生活福利等。在进行工作时应取得学校党和行政的领导和支持和取得青年团的密切帮助。
    大会认为：为了适应当前的实际情况，学联的组织成员应该加以改变。今后全国学联直接吸收各高等学校学生会为团体会员。中等学校学生会则直接在学校党政的领导和青年团组织的帮助下进行工作，不再成为全国学联的会员。由于中学生年龄较小，他们的很多活动都需要学校行政和教师的指导；中等学校数量很多，比较分散，学联也不可能直接联系这样多的单位；目前学校党和行政的领导已经加强，青年团和少年先锋队的组织和工作已经有了相当基础；因此，这种改变是切合实际的。今后各中等学校学生会之间的共同活动，由各级青年团的领导机关负责组织。
    六日下午，大会选举了中华全国学生联合会第十六届委员会，通过了向毛主席致敬电。接着，大会宣告闭幕。
