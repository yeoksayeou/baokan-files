    Vigorously Carrying Out Soil and Water Conservation Work in the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River
    In order to fundamentally control the Yellow River and develop agricultural production in mountainous areas, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu and other provinces in the middle reaches of the Yellow River are vigorously carrying out soil and water conservation work. Shanxi Province has specially established a Soil and Water Conservation Bureau, and each prefecture has established a Soil and Water Conservation Section. Soil and water conservation experimental stations and extension stations have been established in twenty-two key counties. Soil and water conservation work in the province has been rapidly launched. According to incomplete statistics as of mid-June, more than 900,000 mu of soil erosion area can be initially controlled through methods such as repairing field ridges, large and small gully dams, water weirs, water cellars, "lying ox pits," dry wells, interception ditches, tree planting, and grass planting. According to statistics from 83 key townships in 8 counties in the Suide area of Shaanxi Province in the first half of the year, the completed projects can control more than 70,000 mu of soil erosion area. Yan'an, Yulin, Baoji and other regions have also successively established soil and water conservation institutions and focused on carrying out soil and water conservation work.
    In Gansu Province, the field projects carried out in the Qingyang area in the first half of the year alone can control 370,000 mu of soil erosion area. Dingxi, Tianshui, Pingliang and other regions have also successively carried out soil and water conservation work.
    In order to complete the tasks for the second half of the year, various regions successively held soil and water conservation work conferences in May and June to conscientiously summarize the experience of the first half of the year and specifically arrange the work for the second half of the year.

    在社会主义的道路上前进
    黄河中游各地大力进行水土保持工作
    为了根治黄河，发展山区的农业生产，黄河中游山西、陕西、甘肃等省，大力开展水土保持工作。山西省专门建立了水土保持局，各专区建立了水土保持科，二十二个重点县内建立水土保持试验站与推广站，全省水土保持工作已迅速开展起来，截至六月中旬的不完全统计，通过培修地埂、大小谷坊、水簸箕、水窖、卧牛坑、旱井、截水沟、植树、种草等办法，已有九十余万亩的水土流失面积可初步得到控制。陕西省绥德专区上半年据八个县八十三个重点乡的统计，已完成的工程共可控制七万多亩的水土流失面积。延安、榆林、宝鸡等专区也先后建立了水土保持机构，重点地开展了水土保持工作。
    甘肃省庆阳专区仅上半年所进行的田间工程一项即可控制三十七万亩的水土流失面积。定西、天水、平凉等专区也都先后开展了水土保持工作。
    为了完成下半年的任务，各地都在五、六月间先后召开了水土保持工作会议，认真地总结上半年的经验，并具体安排了下半年的工作。　（张国维）
