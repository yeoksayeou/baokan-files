The Peace No. 2 Steamer of the Shanghai Maritime Administration, from the beginning of October 1950 to the end of 1954, for a full four years and three months, traveled back and forth between Shanghai, Tianjin, Dalian, and Qinhuangdao on the Bohai Sea, accumulating more than 116,680 nautical miles (equivalent to more than 217,000 kilometers). It has never had a marine accident, creating the highest record of maritime safety transportation in our country.

The main reason why the Peace No. 2 Steamer has been able to continuously sail safely for more than four years without marine accidents is that all the crew members, under the education of the Party, have established a high sense of responsibility for the lives and property of the people. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the trade union closely cooperated with the administration, and often educated the staff and workers through specific examples, and carried out criticism and self-criticism to consolidate labor discipline and ensure safe navigation. The crew members knew that if the ship had an accident at sea, the lives of all the crew members and the materials on board would suffer irreparable losses. Therefore, for several years, they have been seriously sticking to their posts, always being vigilant. For areas where accidents are likely to occur, they have concentrated their efforts and taken precautions with a hundred times more care. During the voyage of the Peace No. 2 Steamer, in Shanghai Port, which has always been known as the "first major pass," the turns are large, the currents are rapid, the channels are narrow, and there are many ships. If the speed of the ship is too fast, it is easy to collide with other ships; if the speed is too slow, it is easy to be hit by the rapid current onto the shoal. Between 1953 and 1954, more than 60 percent of the collision accidents of the Shanghai Maritime Administration's ships occurred here. The Peace No. 2 Steamer was particularly cautious on this section of the voyage. They specifically established and persistently implemented a meeting system before leaving and docking at the port, that is, before sailing and docking, they would hold a meeting to study the location of the wharf, the tidal conditions in the port, the possible impact of the tide on the hull, whether the water is against the current or with the current, the size of the wind, whether to drop anchor, how long the anchor chain should be released when anchoring, what measures should be taken in case of any situation, etc., and make full preparations according to different situations. Therefore, for more than four years, although they have entered and exited Shanghai Port more than 420 times, and have encountered many dangers, they have all passed through safely.

There are many difficulties in a ship sailing on the ocean. There are reefs and shoals along the coast, and the weather on the ocean is changeable, sometimes with wind and rain, and sometimes with snow and fog, and also with tides. And on the Huangpu River, due to busy production tasks, sometimes it is necessary to sail at night. The entire crew of the Peace No. 2 Steamer has worked hard to study navigation technology and treated navigation science with extreme seriousness for several years, thus mastering the laws of navigation work, which is also an important reason why they have been able to achieve safe navigation. During each voyage, they have always tirelessly used a "sextant" (an instrument for determining the position of the ship) to observe the sun, moon, and stars, measure the water level, carefully observe the tides, and other methods to check whether their judgment of the ship's position is correct. They carry out these tasks even if the distance to the port is only a hundred nautical miles, so they can quickly overcome difficulties when they encounter them. In April 1954, on one occasion, their ship was returning to Shanghai from Dalian. Although the entire voyage was through fog, no accidents occurred.

Xia Jiazhen, the captain of the Peace No. 2 Steamer, paid special attention to the work of safe navigation. For several years, he has consistently adhered to the practice of holding a meeting before each sailing and docking. In order to ensure safety during navigation, in his work, he not only strictly requires himself to seriously deal with various safety measures, but also patiently educates all the crew members to adhere to operating procedures, and seriously deals with the behavior of ordinary crew members who do not pay attention to safety and may cause accidents. One night in June of last year, the ship left Dalian. According to the channel conditions, he issued a rudder order to turn to the right. Because the on-duty first mate was not focused, he turned the rudder to the left. He immediately stopped it, preventing an accident from happening. In order to test whether the crew members were competent for their work, he often let the helmsmen with poor skills steer the ship on dangerous channels, and he supervised them from the side. This not only trained and improved the skills of the crew members, but also prevented accidents from happening. Xia Jiazhen also worked with the second mate to compile a simple and easy-to-check "Celestial Meridian Table" to simplify the procedure for calculating the ship's position.

The entire crew of the Peace No. 2 Steamer has done a relatively good job in strengthening close cooperation with each other. Because the workers in the engine department often pay attention to the repair and maintenance of the machines, this ship has never caused a marine accident due to machine damage in more than four years. On one occasion, the ship was anchored inside the mouth of the Yangtze River. After the anchor was dropped, signs of a rapid ebb tide were discovered, and a strong wind also arose. It was necessary to urgently raise the anchor and stop elsewhere. Under normal circumstances, after the ship is anchored, it usually takes half an hour to raise the anchor and set sail again. This time, because they cooperated well, they started the engine and set sail in less than ten minutes, thus avoiding running aground. When working on the ship, the second and third mates often automatically assist when the chief mate is busy, and the chief and second mates also take the initiative to help when the third mate has a lot of work.

For more than four years, thanks to the hard work of the entire crew of the Peace No. 2 Steamer, they have won safe navigation and overfulfilled the state transportation plan. At the recent Shanghai Municipal Industrial, Construction, and Transportation Labor Model Conference, the Peace No. 2 Steamer was selected as one of the advanced units in Shanghai, and Captain Xia Jiazhen was also honorably elected as a labor model in Shanghai.

    安全航行十一万多海里的和平二号轮
    吴于水
    上海海运管理局的和平二号轮，从一九五零年十月初起，到一九五四年年底止，整整四年零三个月，在北洋海面上，往返于上海、天津、大连、秦皇岛之间，累计航行了十一万六千六百八十多海里（合二十一万七千多公里），从来没有发生过海损事故，创造了我国海上安全运输的最高纪录。
    和平二号轮，所以能够连续安全航行四年多没有发生海损事故，主要原因是全体船员在党的教育下，树立了对人民生命财产负责的高度责任心；工会在党支部的领导下，密切配合行政，经常通过具体事例对职工进行教育，并且开展批评和自我批评，巩固劳动纪律，保证安全航行。船员们知道：船如果在水上发生事故，全船人员的生命，以及船上的物资，都会遭到无法补救的损失，因此，几年来，他们一直严肃地坚守自己的岗位，时时提高警惕，对于容易发生事故的地段，他们更是集中力量，百倍小心地防范。在和平二号轮的航程中，在一向被称为“头道大关”的上海港里，转弯大、水流急、航道窄、船只多，开船的速度快了，容易同别的船只碰撞；速度慢了，又容易被急流打上浅滩。一九五三年和一九五四年间，上海海运管理局的船舶碰撞事故，有百分之六十以上都是在这里发生的。和平二号轮在这段航程上就特别谨慎。他们特地建立了并长期坚持实行了一种离、靠港口前的碰头会议制度，即在开航和停泊之前，他们先开一次会议，研究码头位置、港内潮流情况、潮流对船体可能发生的影响、水是逆流还是顺流、风力大小、应不应抛锚、抛锚时应放多长的锚链、遇到什么情况应采取什么措施等等，根据不同情况作好充分的准备。因此，四年多来，他们进出上海港虽然有四百二十多个航次，也同样碰到过多次的危险，但都一一平安渡过了。
    船在海洋上行驶，是有很多困难的，沿海一带有暗礁，有浅滩，海洋上的气候变化多端，有时有风有雨，有时又有雪有雾，还有潮汛。而在黄浦江上，因生产任务繁忙，有时夜间也得航行。和平二号轮的全体船员们，几年来，努力钻研航海技术，极其严肃地对待航海科学，从而掌握了航海工作的规律，这也是他们能够取得安全航行的重要原因。每次航行中他们始终不懈地利用“六分仪”（测定船位的仪器）观测日、月、星辰，测水位，细心地观察潮流等办法，考核他们判断的船位是否正确。这些工作，即令距离港口只有百把海里的路程，他们也照样进行，所以遇到困难也能够迅速克服。一九五四年四月间，有一次他们的船从大连回上海，虽然整个航程都是行驶在雾中，也没有出什么事故。
    和平二号轮的船长夏家箴对安全航行的工作特别重视。几年来，他始终不懈地坚持执行在每次开航和靠码头以前的碰头会议。为了保证航行中的安全，在工作中，他不但严格要求自己认真对待各项安全措施，而且耐心地教育全船职工坚持遵守操作规程，对一般船员不重视安全和可能造成事故的行为，则严肃地加以处理。去年六月份的一个晚上，船从大连开出，根据航道情况，他下了个向右转舵的舵令，由于当班的一等水手思想不集中，转了个左舵，他立刻给予制止，防止了事故的发生。为了考核船员们是否能胜任工作，他常常放手让技术差的舵工在危险航道上操舵，自己在旁边监督，这样既能锻炼和提高船员的技术，也防止了事故的发生。夏家箴还同二副共同研究，编制了简便易查的“天体近子午线表”，以简化查算船位的程序。
    和平二号轮的全体船员们对于加强相互之间的密切配合是作得比较好的。由于轮机部的工人们经常注意了机器的检修和保养，四年多来，这艘船从未因机器损坏而造成海损事故。有一次，船在长江口内抛锚，锚抛下以后，发现急落潮的征象，同时又起了大风，需要紧急起锚，另停别处。在通常情况下，船抛锚以后，再起锚开船，一般都需要半个小时，这一次由于他们配合得好，不到十分钟就动车开船了，因此，避免了搁浅。在船上工作，常常是大副忙时二副、三副自动协助，三副工作多时，大副二副也主动帮忙。
    四年多来，由于和平二号轮的全体船员们的辛勤劳动，赢得了安全航行，超额完成了国家运输计划。在最近召开的上海市工业、建筑业、交通运输业的劳动模范大会上，和平二号轮被评选为上海市先进单位之一，船长夏家箴也光荣地当选为上海市的劳动模范。
