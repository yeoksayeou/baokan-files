Xinhua News Agency, San Marino, August 16th: The Republic of San Marino held elections for the Grand and General Council, its highest legislative body, on the 14th. The results show that the alliance of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party won 35 of the 60 seats in the Grand and General Council, an increase of four seats compared to the previous Grand and General Council. The Communist and Socialist alliance, which continues to control the majority in the Grand and General Council, will govern for another four years.

San Marino is a small republic on the Italian peninsula. It covers an area of ​​60 square kilometers and is surrounded by Italian territory. It has a population of approximately 13,500. Since World War II, San Marino has been governed by the alliance of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party. During the San Marino elections in 1949 and 1951, the Italian government exerted pressure on San Marino in an attempt to get the San Marino Christian Democratic Party to win a majority, but each time it failed. The Italian government used the same tactics in this election.

On the eve of this election, planes even flew from New York in the United States, carrying more than a hundred San Marino immigrants in the United States back to San Marino. According to American news agency reports, these people's mission was to vote for the Christian Democratic Party and "overthrow the Communist regime." However, these conspiracies by foreign forces to interfere in San Marino's internal affairs have all failed.

    在圣马力诺共和国议会选举中
    共产党和社会党联盟获胜
    新华社十六日讯　圣马力诺消息：圣马力诺共和国十四日举行了最高立法机关大议会的选举。选举结果，在大议会六十个议席中，共产党和社会党组成的联盟得到三十五席，比上届大议会中的席位多了四席。继续控制大议会多数的共产党和社会党联盟将再执政四年。
    圣马力诺是意大利半岛上的一个小共和国。面积六十平方公里，它的四面都是意大利的领土。人口约一万三千五百人。第二次世界大战以后，圣马力诺一直是由共产党和社会党联盟执政。在一九四九年、一九五一年圣马力诺选举时，意大利政府曾经向圣马力诺施加压力，想使圣马力诺天主教民主党获得多数，但是每次都没有成功。在这次选举时，意大利政府又使用了同样的手段。
    在这次选举前夕，还从美国纽约飞出了飞机，载着一百多个在美国的圣马力诺移民赶回圣马力诺。美国通讯社消息说，这些人的任务就是去投票支持天主教民主党，“推翻共产党政权”。但是，外国势力企图干涉圣马力诺内政的这些阴谋都失败了。
