To all comrades of the First National Congress of the China First Machinery Industry Trade Union, forwarded by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions:

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China warmly congratulates the opening of your congress and wishes the meeting a success.

    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, all workers, engineers, technicians, and staff members of the machinery industry sector have restored and developed China's machinery industry through creative labor, and have begun large-scale and technologically advanced capital construction work. They have also carried out and are carrying out the socialist transformation of private machinery industry. During the period of the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, the state is using great strength to build and develop the machinery industry, preparing conditions for the technological transformation of China's industry, transportation, and agriculture. The private machinery industry should also be brought into the orbit of the state plan. All employees in the machinery industry sector bear a significant and glorious task in this regard.

    Developing heavy industry and its core—the machinery industry—is the foundation of the country's socialist industrialization. In recent years, China's machinery industry has made great progress, successfully trial-producing many new products that could not be manufactured in the past. However, it should also be pointed out that there are still many problems in our machinery industry—the quality of products is not good, the trial production of new products is not satisfactory, waste is serious, and many new technologies and equipment have not been well mastered. The workers, engineers, technicians, and staff members of the national machinery industry must make further efforts to gradually change this situation to meet the needs of national economic construction.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China hopes that through this congress you will further strengthen the ties between the trade union and the masses, further raise the political consciousness of the workers, carry forward the fine tradition of the working class's hard struggle, practice comprehensive economy, strengthen labor discipline, strive to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, master new technologies, promote China's effective advanced experience, launch mass rationalization proposals, give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of all employees in the machinery industry sector, push the labor competition to a new upsurge, and continuously improve labor productivity, in order to strive for the victorious completion of the glorious tasks of your First Five-Year Plan.

                  Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

    中国共产党中央委员会给大会的祝词中华全国总工会转中国第一机械工会第一次全国代表大会的全体同志们：
    中国共产党中央委员会热烈祝贺你们的大会开幕，并预祝会议成功。
    中华人民共和国成立以来，机械工业部门的全体工人、工程技术人员和职员，以创造性的劳动恢复和发展了我国的机械工业，并开始进行了规模巨大、技术先进的基本建设工作，对私营机械工业也进行了和进行着社会主义改造。在发展国民经济的第一个五年计划期间，国家正以巨大的力量建设和发展机械工业，为我国工业、交通运输和农业的技术改造准备条件。对于私营机械工业，也要纳入国家计划的轨道。机械工业部门的全体职工在这方面担负着重大而光荣的任务。
    发展重工业和它的核心——机械工业是国家的社会主义工业化的基础。几年来，我国机械工业有了很大的进步，试制成功了许多过去不能制造的新产品，但是，也应指出，我们的机械工业还存在着很多问题——产品质量不佳，新产品试制工作还不能令人满意，浪费现象严重，许多新的技术设备还不能很好地掌握等等。全国机械工业的工人、工程技术人员和职员同志们必须作进一步的努力来逐步改变这种状态，以适应国家经济建设的需要。
    中国共产党中央委员会希望你们经过这次大会进一步密切工会与群众的联系，进一步提高职工群众的政治觉悟，发扬工人阶级艰苦奋斗的优良传统，厉行全面节约，加强劳动纪律，努力学习苏联先进经验，掌握新的技术，推广我国行之有效的先进经验，开展群众性的合理化建议，发挥机械工业部门全体职工的积极性和创造性，把劳动竞赛推向新的高涨，不断地提高劳动生产率，为胜利完成你们所担负的第一个五年计划的光荣任务而奋斗。
                  中国共产党中央委员会
                      一九五五年八月十五日
