Xinhua News Agency report:

    Demobilized and construction soldiers who have returned to Liaoning, Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have played an active role in production and construction and various other work.
    Many demobilized construction soldiers who have returned to rural areas have become backbones in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, actively leading the masses to take the path of mutual aid and cooperation. According to statistics from some counties and cities in Liaoning Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, 70% to 80% of demobilized construction soldiers who have returned to rural areas have participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Many demobilized construction soldiers have taken leadership positions in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams. In the rural areas of Xin Jin and 27 other counties and cities in Liaoning Province, 2,269 demobilized construction soldiers serve as directors of agricultural production cooperatives, and 3,720 demobilized construction soldiers serve as leaders of mutual aid teams. Many demobilized construction soldiers have become model figures. Yunnan Province recently selected over 900 model demobilized construction soldiers in 69 counties. In Tongliao County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, 64 demobilized construction soldiers were recognized as various types of models. Li Changyu, a demobilized construction soldier who returned to Wenshan County, Yunnan Province, is a disabled soldier who lost a finger in the Liberation War, but he overcame many difficulties and finally learned to plow and use a hoe. In 1954, he cultivated five mu of land and opened one and a half mu of wasteland, and was rewarded by the Wenshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
    Many demobilized construction soldiers have served as the main administrative cadres of villages and townships, and some have been elected as representatives to people's congresses at all levels. Demobilized construction soldiers serving in leadership positions in Daguo Yu Village, Gaiping County, Liaoning Province, actively carried out propaganda work in the unified purchase and sale work, enabling the village to overfulfill its grain purchase task. Wang Jiayi, a demobilized construction soldier who served as the village head of Wangjia Village in Dalian City, has closely united the masses. The people of Wangjia Village have actively responded to the government's call. In the past two or three years, Wangjia Village has successively won the honorary titles of model village for protecting highways, sanitation, and preferential treatment.

    辽宁等省复员建设军人积极参加生产建设
    新华社讯　回到辽宁、四川、云南、甘肃、内蒙古自治区等地的复员建设军人，在生产战线上和各项工作中发挥了积极作用。
    许多回到农村的复员建设军人成为互助合作运动中的骨干分子，他们积极带动群众走互助合作道路。据辽宁省、内蒙古自治区部分县、市的统计，回到农村的复员建设军人有百分之七十到八十参加了互助合作组织。不少复员建设军人担任了农业生产合作社和互助组的领导职务。在辽宁省的新金等二十八个县市的农村中，有二千二百六十九名复员建设军人担任了农业生产合作社的主任，三千七百二十名复员建设军人担任了互助组组长。许多复员建设军人成为模范人物。云南省在六十九个县中，最近评选出了九百多名模范复员建设军人。内蒙古自治区通辽县被评为各种模范的复员建设军人有六十四名。回到云南文山县的复员建设军人李昌玉，是一个在解放战争中失去手指的残废军人，但他克服了重重困难，终于学会了掌犁和使用锄头。一九五四年他自己耕了五亩地，开了一亩半荒地，受到中共文山县委员会的奖励。
    许多复员建设军人担任了村、乡的主要行政干部，有的并被选为各级人民代表大会代表。担任辽宁省盖平县大锅峪村领导工作的复员建设军人，在统购统销工作中积极进行宣传，使全村超额完成了购粮任务。在旅大市王家村担任村长的复员建设军人王家义，由于紧密地团结了群众，全村人民积极响应政府号召，近二、三年来，王家村先后获得了爱护公路、卫生、优抚等模范村的光荣称号。
