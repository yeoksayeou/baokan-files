The Ministry of Construction Engineering convened a meeting of directors of engineering management bureaus and managers of engineering companies from August 5th to 12th. The meeting determined that the main task of the Ministry of Construction Engineering system in the second half of this year is to further implement the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on practicing comprehensive economy, continue to mobilize the broad masses of workers to deeply carry out the anti-waste struggle, ensure the comprehensive completion and over-fulfillment of this year's construction engineering tasks, and make various preparations for next year's engineering construction.

The meeting considered that through several months of comprehensive conservation work in the Ministry of Construction Engineering system, some major waste phenomena have been changed, and a sum of funds has been saved for the country; the concept of conservation has also been initially established among the broad masses of workers. However, because some leading cadres do not have a deep enough understanding of the conservation work, and some new problems arising in the conservation work have not been solved in time, the comprehensive conservation work in many units has not been carried out comprehensively or deeply, and waste phenomena continue to occur. In particular, because many units did not pay close attention to how to ensure the comprehensive completion of engineering tasks when carrying out conservation work, many important indicators were not completed in the first half of the year, and quality and safety accidents continued to occur. This not only affects the speed of engineering construction, but also causes great waste.

The meeting considered that continuing to comprehensively and deeply carry out the anti-waste struggle, and ensuring the comprehensive over-fulfillment of this year's engineering tasks in this struggle, is an important task for the Ministry of Construction Engineering system in the second half of the year. To this end, the meeting determined: (1) In terms of design, the State Council's regulations on reducing costs should continue to be implemented, and the design standards for civil buildings should be quickly revised for use in the second half of the year; for productive buildings, the cost should also be appropriately reduced without hindering the progress and quality of the project. Engineering design should have a comprehensive perspective, paying attention to economy, quality, firmness, and applicability; otherwise, it will also cause waste. At the same time, different cost measures should be taken according to different regions and different situations. For example, in a few severely cold regions, in order to solve the problem of cold protection, soil cement (i.e., mixing 10% cement in loess) can be tested for use as walls, which can reduce the cost by about 41% compared with bricks. The use of low-priced bamboo structures should also be widely adopted. In addition, attention should be paid to saving steel and wood in design. (2) In terms of construction, it is necessary to ensure the completion of this year's various engineering indicators. All units must first determine the engineering projects for the second half of the year and prepare for winter construction. In order to solve the current problem of idleness, after consultation with Party A, efforts should be made to complete some of next year's engineering tasks in advance in the second half of the year, and rainy and winter construction should be actively promoted. In addition, it is necessary to strengthen planning and management work, so as to achieve balanced construction according to the plan, in order to change the chaos in construction and the resulting huge waste. In order to better implement the plan, it is also necessary to improve the professional level of grassroots cadres and appropriately equip grassroots cadres. (3) It is necessary to effectively improve engineering quality and strengthen safety work, and overcome the situation of opposing engineering progress, conservation work, and quality assurance. Establish a technical responsibility system and a strict technical inspection and technical supervision system, and conduct specific technical briefings to workers. (4) Implement the economic accounting system in all work. It is necessary to strengthen the management and planning of materials; actively handle stockpiled materials. In addition to internal balance and allocation, design units should try to use stockpiled materials as much as possible when designing. Strictly control the increase in workers, and workers who are insufficient should be transferred from units with surplus workers. At the same time, promote the piece-rate wage system and vigorously improve labor productivity. Administrative expenses must not be overspent. In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen economic activity analysis, which is an effective method to improve work and overcome waste.

The meeting pointed out that doing a good job in preparing for next year's construction is not only of great significance for completing the factory construction tasks of the first five-year plan, but also an important condition for avoiding waste. In order to do a good job in preparing for next year's construction, the meeting determined that construction units and construction units should jointly do a good job in the overall construction progress plan. With this plan, there will be a basis for various construction preparation work. At the same time, for projects that have reached the preliminary design stage, it is necessary to seize the time to prepare the construction conditions design; for projects that have reached the technical design stage, it is necessary to prepare the overall construction organization design. In addition, construction units should study the drawings as early as possible so that they can have a clear understanding when construction begins. The meeting pointed out, based on the experience of many regions in the past, that in the process of construction preparation, it is necessary to prevent both relaxation of preparation and blind preparation, because this will inevitably lead to chaos and waste in construction.

The meeting also made arrangements for strengthening professional companies, training technical personnel, and improving leadership style.

During the meeting, Soviet experts such as Prokopiev put forward valuable suggestions on carrying out comprehensive conservation work and construction preparation and construction management. The Ministry of Construction Engineering is studying these suggestions and will vigorously implement them. (Xinhua News Agency)

    建筑工程部召开局长和经理会议
    确定继续发动广大职工开展反浪费斗争
    建筑工程部八月五日到十二日召开所属工程管理总局局长和工程公司经理会议。这次会议确定，建筑工程部系统今年下半年的主要工作，是进一步贯彻中共中央和国务院关于厉行全面节约的指示，继续发动广大职工深入地开展反浪费斗争，保证全面完成和超额完成今年的建筑工程任务，并做好明年工程施工的各种准备工作。
    会议认为，建筑工程部系统经过几个月来进行的全面节约工作，某些重大的浪费现象已经得到改变，并为国家节省了一笔资金；广大职工的节约观念也初步树立起来。但是，由于部分领导干部对节约工作认识得不够深刻，对于在节约工作中引起的一些新的问题没有及时加以解决，因而不少单位的全面节约工作还开展得不全面，不深入，浪费现象仍然继续发生。特别是由于不少单位在开展节约工作时，对如何保证全面完成工程任务抓得不紧，因而上半年许多重要指标没有完成，质量事故和安全事故连续发生。这样，不仅影响工程的建设速度，而且还造成很大的浪费。
    会议认为，继续全面深入地开展反浪费斗争，并在这一斗争中保证全面超额完成今年的工程任务，是建筑工程部系统下半年的重要任务。为此，会议确定：（一）在设计方面，要继续执行国务院关于降低造价的规定，对于民用建筑设计标准要很快加以修正，以供下半年使用；对生产性建筑，在不妨碍工程进度和工程质量的条件下，也要把造价适当降低。工程设计要有全面观点，既要注意经济，又要注意质量、坚固和适用，否则同样会造成浪费。同时，要根据不同地区不同情况采取不同的造价措施，如在少数严寒地区，为解决防寒问题，可试验采用土壤水泥等（即在黄土中掺百分之十的水泥）作墙壁，比用砖可降低造价百分之四一左右。并要广泛采用价格较低的竹结构。此外，设计中还要注意节省钢材和木材。（二）在施工方面，要保证完成今年的各项工程指标。各单位首先要把下半年的工程项目确定下来，并做好冬季施工准备工作。为解决目前的窝工问题，经过和甲方商量后，争取下半年提前完成一些明年的工程任务，同时要积极推行雨天和冬季施工。此外，还要加强计划管理工作，做到按计划均衡地施工，以改变施工混乱和因此造成巨大浪费的情况。为了更好地执行计划，还必须提高基层干部的业务水平，适当地配备基层干部。（三）要切实改善工程质量和加强安全工作，克服把工程进度、节约工作和保证质量对立起来的情况。建立技术责任制度和严格的技术检查、技术监督的制度，具体地向工人进行技术交底工作。（四）在一切工作中贯彻经济核算制度。要加强材料的管理和计划工作；对积压的材料要积极处理，除了进行内部平衡调拨外，设计单位设计时尽量采用积压的材料。严格控制增招工人，工人不足者由工人多余的单位调配。同时推行计件工资制，大力提高劳动生产率。行政费用一律不得超支。此外，还要加强经济活动分析工作，这是改进工作、克服浪费的有效方法。
    会议指出，作好明年施工的准备工作，不但对完成第一个五年计划建厂任务有重大意义，而且是避免浪费的重要条件。为了作好明年施工的准备工作，会议确定施工单位和建设单位要共同做好施工总进度计划，有了这一计划，施工的各项准备工作就有了依据。同时初步设计已到达的工程，要抓紧编制施工条件设计；技术设计已到达的工程要编制施工组织总设计。此外，施工单位要及早学习图纸，以便施工时心中有数。会议根据过去不少地区的经验指出，在进行施工准备时，既要防止放松准备，又要防止盲目准备，因为这都必然要造成施工的混乱和浪费。
    这次会议对加强专业公司、培养技术力量、改进领导作风等工作，也都作了布置。
    会议期间，普洛阔费也夫等苏联专家分别对开展全面节约工作和施工准备、施工管理方面提出了宝贵的建议。建筑工程部对这些建议正进行研究并将大力贯彻。（新华社）
