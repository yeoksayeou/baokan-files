　　Improve the Work of Enterprise Party Organizations in Many Ways
　　Song Cheng
    The work content of the Party's grassroots organizations in factories and mines is rich, and the methods and approaches are also diverse. In order to closely connect the masses with the Party, to implement the Party's policies and fulfill the resolutions of higher-level organizations, and to ensure the completion of the state plan; grassroots organizations must pay attention to the economic activities of the enterprise in many ways, mobilize the strength of all Party members and all employees, lead the trade union and the Communist Youth League, and effectively guarantee and supervise production; they must continuously develop new Party members and strengthen the Party's ranks; they must strengthen the management and education of Party members, organize Party members to study, and improve the Party members' awareness and level of Marxism-Leninism; they must do a good job in publicity and lead reporters and propagandists to publicize the Party's policies to the masses at all times. The working methods of the Party's grassroots organizations are also diverse. The staff of grassroots organizations should frequently carry out individual work among the masses; they should use various meetings to solve problems in their work; they should also edit and publish newspapers, make reports to the masses, give lectures, read newspapers, and so on. These tasks are for a common purpose and are interrelated and mutually reinforcing. Therefore, in order to strengthen the work of the Party's grassroots organizations and make the grassroots organizations truly become fighting fortresses, it is necessary to ensure that all aspects of the Party's work can continue to develop healthily, and it is necessary to be good at flexibly using various working methods and approaches to complete the political tasks of the Party organization. Of course, within a certain period, it is possible and necessary to concentrate efforts to solve a certain problem and improve a certain aspect of work. However, it is impossible to truly strengthen the work of grassroots organizations by focusing on a certain aspect of work for a long time or using only one working method in isolation, because doing so will not truly strengthen the work of grassroots organizations.
    However, many Party organizations in industrial and mining enterprises often do not pay enough attention to this point in their actual work. At present, the reason why the general meetings of Party members in many factories and mines are not well held and have not played their due role in improving the work of enterprise Party organizations is mainly because the Party organizations in these factories and mines have long focused only on holding good general meetings of Party members as a single link, and have not paid attention to improving the work of the Party organization in many ways. Some enterprise Party organizations even regard holding a good general meeting of Party members as the entire work of the grassroots organization, believing that holding a good general meeting of Party members means doing a good job of the Party's work and solving all the problems in the work of the grassroots Party organization. Therefore, the branch committee prepares for the general meeting of Party members, convenes the general meeting of Party members, and checks the implementation of the resolutions of the general meeting of Party members every month, while not paying much attention to, or even not paying any attention to, the daily ideological and organizational construction of the Party organization.
    The general meeting of Party members is the highest leading body of the Party's grassroots organization. Holding a good general meeting of Party members is of great significance for promoting democracy, giving play to the enthusiasm of all Party members, and strengthening the grassroots organization's guarantee and supervision of production. Therefore, it is entirely necessary for the Party organizations in factories and mines to take some time to study how to hold a good general meeting of Party members. However, if the general meeting of Party members is held in isolation as some factory and mine Party organizations do, it will be difficult to achieve significant results. Moreover, only when the regular work of the Party organization is in-depth and specific, and the democratic life within the Party is relatively full, can the branch committee propose ideological topics for discussion at the general meeting of Party members, and can Party members express their opinions without reservation, carry out criticism and self-criticism, so that the general meeting of Party members will truly play a role in promoting all aspects of the Party's work. Conversely, if the branch committee does not pay attention to improving the Party's work in many ways, or even relaxes the Party's daily work, then the general meeting of Party members will not be well held. At present, this is the situation in a considerable number of the Party's industrial and mining grassroots organizations. They only attempt to change the weak state of the Party's work by learning from the experience of the Party organization of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory in holding good general meetings of Party members, without paying attention to improving and strengthening all aspects of the Party's work. As a result, although a long time has passed, the weak state of the Party's work has not changed much. Therefore, it is difficult for the branch committee to propose major ideological topics for discussion at the general meeting, and the general meeting becomes poor in content and lacks ideological depth. Each time, the key to the current month's production or technical organization measures is discussed as usual, and resolutions are made accordingly. However, the resolutions of the general meeting are often not well implemented, and even if they are implemented, the role in improving the Party's work is not very large, because these resolutions do not touch upon the major issues in the Party's work.
    The path taken by the boiler workshop branch of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory over the past few years well illustrates this problem. In 1951, this branch devoted all its efforts to holding good general meetings of Party members. The branch secretary felt that there was work only when the general meeting of Party members was held, and there was no other work besides the general meeting of Party members. However, until the first half of 1953, there were still many problems in the branch's work, the guarantee and supervision of production was always weak, the workshop's production plan was often not well completed, the style of leadership of the branch's leading staff was not democratic enough, the collective leadership role of the branch committee could not be fully played, and the branch committee often acted according to the individual opinions of the branch secretary. The Party's internal life was not active enough, there were many shortcomings in the development of new Party members and the education of new Party members, and some Party members often made trouble about treatment and disobeyed leadership. There were also many problems in the work of the trade union and the Communist Youth League, and they could not play a good role in production, and were busy with trivial matters all day long. The branch devoted all its efforts to the general meeting of Party members, but the general meeting of Party members was not well held either. The content of the meeting was general, the issues discussed were repeated with the administrative meeting, the Party members were not interested, and the effect of the meeting was not significant enough, and the branch committee also felt depressed. When the branch committee was re-elected in June 1953, it reviewed the branch's work, exposed the above-mentioned many serious problems, and proposed ways to improve the branch's work. The branch committee decided to give play to the organizational role of the branch committee, formulated the work tasks and scope of authority of the branch committee; strengthened the leadership of the trade union and the Communist Youth League, clarified the main tasks of the trade union and the Communist Youth League, regularly checked their work, led the trade union to do a good job in labor competition, led the Communist Youth League to educate young workers to improve their skills, to do a good job in the relationship between master and apprentice, to strengthen the leadership of the propaganda network, and so on, and also learned from the experience of Factory 53. From then on, the work of the branch gradually developed more comprehensively, the collective leadership role of the branch committee was strengthened compared to the past, the problems in the Party's organizational construction and ideological construction also attracted the attention of the branch committee, and were often discussed at the general meeting of Party members, and the trade union and the Communist Youth League also began to face production. The branch's role in guaranteeing and supervising production was significantly strengthened, and with the strengthening of administrative work, this workshop was rated as an advanced workshop in the city of Lushun-Dalian in 1954. After the work of the branch was fully developed, the situation of the general meeting of Party members also changed. After the work of all aspects of the Party, as well as the work of the trade union and the Communist Youth League, was gradually strengthened, naturally many more important issues would be raised for discussion at the general meeting of Party members. After the second half of 1953, the following issues were discussed at the general meeting of Party members one after another: the activities of the Party's小组, the education of new Party members, the exemplary role and discipline of Party members, how Party members should do propaganda work and the issue of the propaganda network, and the quality problems in production were discussed many times. After the work of the trade union was strengthened and the production meeting was held better, the general meeting of Party members no longer focused on studying specific technical issues and management issues when discussing production issues, as it had in the past, but paid more attention to policy guidelines and ideological style issues. Although the work of the boiler workshop branch still has many shortcomings, their method of improving the branch's work is worthy of attention.
    The situation of the branch of the second workshop of Factory 53 also shows that only by paying attention to strengthening the Party organization's regular political and ideological work can the fighting role of the Party organization be brought into play, and can the general meeting of Party members be held well. The original work foundation of the branch of the second workshop of Factory 53 was relatively good, especially in conducting meticulous and in-depth ideological work. On this work basis, their general meeting of Party members was held relatively well. They often purposefully convened the general meeting of Party members because the branch conducted meticulous and in-depth ideological work, and felt that there were certain major issues that needed to be submitted to all Party members for discussion. For example, in May of this year, the central task of the workshop was to implement the economic accounting system. The branch found from participating in administrative work meetings and individual talks with foremen that from the foremen to the workers, there was a general view of "fear of difficulties," "fear of trouble," and "it has nothing to do with me" regarding the implementation of the economic accounting system. The branch committee then held a symposium to let everyone talk about their views on economic accounting. From this meeting, the branch committee found that the emotion of "fear of difficulties" was unfounded. For example, some foremen said that they were old, had little education, and could not handle this set of things; but some old foremen did a very good job, so it can be seen that difficulties are not insurmountable. After the branch committee discovered the problem and grasped the materials for solving the problem, it widely carried out propaganda work, and at the same time, the branch committee members divided up the work and continued to conduct in-depth and focused individual mobilization and education work. The branch committee felt that these were not enough, and that the implementation of economic accounting should become the action program of the entire branch, so it decided to hold a general meeting of Party members with the theme of "how to overcome the ideological obstacles in the implementation of the economic accounting system, and how to make economic accounting the action program of the masses." This general meeting of Party members basically eliminated the ideological obstacles in the implementation of economic accounting. This and many other general meetings of Party members in the second workshop of Factory 53 are not without shortcomings, but it can be seen more clearly from here what the correct relationship between the general meeting of Party members and the regular work of the Party organization is.
    Perhaps some people think that the Party organization of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory has already had a set of experiences in holding good general meetings of Party members, but there is not much experience in other aspects of the Party organization's work, so it is difficult to improve the Party organization's work in many ways for a while. In fact, the experience of the Party organization of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory cannot solve all the problems of holding good general meetings of Party members, and in order to hold good general meetings of Party members, the Party organizations in various places must continue to carry out creative work. Although there is not much work experience in the enterprise Party organization system at present, this does not mean that the Party's work cannot be improved in many ways. As long as the enterprise Party organization and the Party's provincial and municipal leading organs can pay attention to the work of the enterprise Party organization in many ways, can truly go deep into actual life, constantly summarize and concentrate the budding and sporadic experiences, and disseminate them in a timely manner, and constantly learn lessons from failures, shortcomings, and mistakes, the work of the Party organization can be gradually improved.

　　多方面地改进企业党组织的工作
　　宋琤
    厂矿企业中党的基层组织的工作内容是丰富的，方法和方式也是多种多样的。为了密切人民群众同党的联系，为了贯彻党的政策和实现上级组织的决议并保证完成国家计划；基层组织要多方面地关心企业的经济活动，动员全体党员全体职工的力量，领导工会和青年团，切实有效地对生产进行保证和监督；要不断地发展新党员、壮大党的队伍；要加强对党员的管理教育，组织党员学习，提高党员的觉悟和马克思列宁主义水平；要做好宣传工作，领导报告员和宣传员时时刻刻向群众宣传党的政策。党的基层组织的工作方法也是多种多样的，基层组织的工作人员要在群众中经常地进行个别工作；要运用各种会议来解决工作中的问题；还要编辑出版报纸、向群众做报告、讲课、读报等。这些工作都是为着共同的目的，并且是互相关联互相推动的。因此，要想加强党的基层组织工作，使基层组织真正成为战斗的堡垒，就必须使党的各方面的工作都能不断健康地向前发展，就必须善于灵活地运用各种工作方法方式来完成党组织的政治任务。当然，在一定的时间内，比较集中力量去解决某一方面的问题，改进某一方面的工作，这是可以的也是必要的。但是，不能长期地片面地抓住某一方面的工作，或者只孤立地运用某一工作方法，因为这样做不可能真正加强基层组织的工作。
    但是，有不少工矿企业中的党组织，在实际工作中，对于这一点往往注意不够。目前，有许多厂矿党组织的党员大会所以开得不好，对于改进企业党组织的工作没有发挥应有的作用，其中主要原因之一是，就因为这些厂矿的党组织长时期只孤立地抓住开好党员大会这一个环节，而没有注意从多方面去改进党组织的工作。有些企业党组织甚至把开好党员大会，当成了基层组织的全部工作，以为开好了党员大会就是做好了党的工作，就解决了基层党组织工作中的一切问题。因此支部委员会，每月就是准备党员大会、召开党员大会、检查党员大会决议的执行情况，而对于党组织的日常的思想建设、组织建设工作则不很注意，甚至根本没有注意。
    党员大会是党的基层组织的最高领导机关。开好党员大会对于发扬民主，发挥全体党员的积极性，加强基层组织对生产的保证监督有重大的作用。因此，厂矿中的党组织拿出一定的时间来研究如何开好党员大会，这完全是必要的。但是，如果像有些厂矿党组织那样孤立地召开党员大会，就很难有显著的成效。而且，只有党组织的经常工作是深入具体的，党内的民主生活是比较充分的，支委会才有可能提出富有思想性的议题在党员大会上讨论，党员们才能无所顾忌地发表意见，开展批评和自我批评，这样，党员大会才会真正对党的各方面的工作起推动作用。相反地，如果支委会不注意从多方面来改进党的工作，甚至放松党的日常工作，那末党员大会也是开不好的。目前，有相当一部分党的工矿基层组织的情况正是这样。他们只是企图通过学习哈尔滨机车车辆修理厂党组织开好党员大会的经验来改变党的工作薄弱的状况，而不去注意改进和加强党的各方面的工作。结果，时间虽然过去了很久，而党的工作薄弱的状况仍然没有多大改变。因此，支部委员会就很难提出重大的富有思想性的议题交大会讨论，党员大会就弄得内容贫乏，议题缺乏思想性，每次照例讨论当月生产的关键或技术组织措施，照例就此做出决议。而大会的决议往往并不能很好地贯彻执行，即使执行了，对改进党的工作的作用也不太大，因为这些决议并没有接触到党工作中的重大问题。
    大连机车车辆制造厂锅炉车间支部几年来所走的道路就很好地说明了这个问题。这个支部在一九五一年就把力量都用在开好党员大会上，支部书记感到只有开党员大会才有工作，除了党员大会，就再没有别的工作。可是，一直到一九五三年上半年，支部工作中一直有很多问题，对生产的保证监督始终是无力的，车间的生产计划经常完成得不好，支部的领导工作人员作风不够民主，支部委员会的集体领导作用不能充分发挥，支部委员会中常常是按支部书记个人的意见办事。党内生活不够活跃，发展新党员、对新党员的教育工作都有不少缺点，有些党员经常闹待遇、不服从领导。工会、青年团的工作中问题也很多，在生产方面不能很好地发挥作用，一天忙于琐碎事务。支部把力量都用在党员大会上，可是党员大会也并没有开好，会议的内容一般化，讨论的问题和行政会议重复，党员们不感兴趣，大会的效果也不够显著，支委会也感到苦闷。一九五三年六月支部委员会改选时，检查了支部工作，揭发了以上许多严重问题，提出了改进支部工作的办法。支委会确定要发挥支部委员会的组织作用，制定了支部委员会的工作任务和职权范围；加强对工会青年团的领导，明确了工会、青年团的主要任务，经常检查他们的工作，领导工会搞好劳动竞赛，领导青年团教育青工提高技术，搞好师徒关系，加强对宣传网的领导等等，同时还学习了五三工厂的经验。从此，支部的工作逐渐有了比较全面的发展，支部委员会的集体领导作用比过去加强了，党的组织建设和思想建设中的问题也引起了支委会的注意，并经常在党员大会上讨论，工会和青年团也都开始面向生产。支部对生产的保证监督作用显著地加强了，加上行政工作的加强，这个车间一九五四年被评为旅大市的先进车间。支部工作得到全面发展以后，党员大会的情况也改变了。党的各方面的工作以及工会青年团的工作逐步加强后，自然就会提出许多比较重要的问题要求在党员大会上讨论。在一九五三年下半年以后，在党员大会上就先后讨论过：党的小组活动、新党员的教育问题、党员的模范作用和遵守纪律问题、党员如何做宣传工作以及宣传网的问题，并多次讨论生产中的质量问题。工会的工作加强了，生产会议开得比较好了，党员大会在讨论生产问题时，就不再像过去那样只是研究具体的技术问题管理问题，而较多地注意了政策方针和思想作风问题。锅炉车间支部的工作虽然还有不少缺点，但是他们改进支部工作的办法是值得注意的。
    五三工厂二车间支部的情况也说明了只有注意加强党组织经常的政治思想工作，才能发挥党组织的战斗作用，也才能开好党员大会。五三工厂二车间支部原来的工作基础就比较好，特别是在进行细致的深入的思想工作方面有很好的经验。在这一工作基础上，他们的党员大会就开得比较好。他们常常是由于支部进行了细致的深入的思想工作，从这里感觉到有某些重大问题需要提交全体党员讨论时，才有目的地召开党员大会。比如，今年五月间，车间的中心工作是贯彻经济核算制。支部从参加行政工作会议和对工长的个别谈话中发现，从工长到工人，对贯彻经济核算制普遍有“怕困难”“怕麻烦”和“与我无关”的看法。支部委员会随即召开了一个座谈会，让大家谈一谈对经济核算的看法。从这个会上支部委员会发现“怕困难”的情绪是没有根据的。比如，有的工长说自己年纪大了，文化低，搞不了这一套；但也有年老的工长却搞得很好，可见困难并不是不能克服的。支部委员会发现了问题，掌握了解决问题的材料，就广泛地开展宣传工作，同时支部委员们分工继续深入有重点地做个别的动员教育工作。支委会感到仅只这些还是不够的，贯彻经济核算应该成为全支部的行动纲领，便决定以“怎样克服贯彻经济核算制中的思想障碍，怎样使经济核算成为群众的行动纲领”为题举行了党员大会。这次党员大会基本上消除了贯彻经济核算中的思想障碍。五三工厂二车间支部这一次以及其他许多次的党员大会都不是没有缺点的，但是，从这里可以比较清楚地看出党员大会和党组织的经常工作之间的正确关系是什么。
    也许有些人以为，哈尔滨机车车辆修理厂党组织在开好党员大会方面已经有了一套经验，党组织的其他方面的工作则经验不多，因此，一时很难多方面地去改进党组织的工作。实际上，哈尔滨机车车辆修理厂党组织的经验并不能解决开好党员大会的所有的问题，要开好党员大会还必须各地党组织继续进行创造性的工作。企业党组织系统的工作经验目前虽然不多，但这并不等于就不能从多方面改进党的工作。只要企业党组织以及党的省、市领导机关能够多方面地关心企业党组织的工作，能够真正深入实际生活中去，不断地把萌芽的点滴的经验总结起来集中起来，并及时地传播出去，不断地从失败和缺点错误中吸取教训，党组织的工作是完全能够逐步地得到改进的。
