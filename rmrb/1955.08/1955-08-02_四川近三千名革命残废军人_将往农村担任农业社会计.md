    Nearly 3,000 disabled revolutionary soldiers have graduated from accounting training classes at various schools for disabled revolutionary soldiers in Sichuan Province. They will soon depart for agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province to take on accounting work.

    These disabled revolutionary soldiers were mostly illiterate or semi-literate in the past. Now, they possess a cultural level equivalent to upper primary and junior secondary school, understand the policies of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, and have initially grasped the basic knowledge of accounting practices. One-third of the trainees can also serve as accounting instructors.

    These disabled revolutionary soldiers were wounded in the Liberation War and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. More than 47% are Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. They continued to promote the fine traditions of revolutionary soldiers during their studies. Volunteer Army veteran and first-class disabled soldier Zhu Zemin was wounded in the head, chest, and feet. He often suffered from headaches and blurred vision while studying, but he stubbornly persisted in his studies, memorizing his lessons even during rest and sleep. He finally mastered accounting and achieved scores above 80 in his assignments.

    四川近三千名革命残废军人  将往农村担任农业社会计
    二千九百多名革命残废军人已在四川省各革命残废军人学校的会计训练班结业。他们很快就要出发到全省各地的农业生产合作社去担任会计工作。
    这些革命残废军人过去都是文盲和半文盲，现在都具有了高小和初中的文化水平，并了解了农业互助合作的政策，初步掌握了会计业务的基本知识。有三分之一的学员还能担任会计辅导员的工作。
    这些革命残废军人都是在解放战争和抗美援朝斗争中负伤的，百分之四十七以上是共产党员和青年团员。他们在学习中继续发扬了革命军人的优良传统。志愿军功臣、一等残废军人祝泽民的头部、胸部和脚部都受过伤，学习时经常头痛、眼花，但他顽强地坚持学习，休息和睡觉时也默记着功课，终于掌握了会计业务，作业成绩都在八十分以上。
