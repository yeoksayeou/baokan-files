Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 23rd: The Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party published a communique on August 22nd regarding its eighth meeting held from August 13th to 20th.

The communique stated that the meeting studied the situation, reviewed the implementation of the resolutions passed by the Seventh Meeting of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, and stipulated new tasks for the entire Party and the people in the future.

In discussing the international situation, the communique pointed out that although the overall international situation has eased to some extent, the causes leading to international tensions still exist, and the situation in Indochina and other regions of the Far East remains tense. American imperialists continue to do their best to push forward their plans to undermine peace in these regions.

The communique stated that on the domestic front, the complete liberation of North Vietnam has created a solid foundation for the struggle of all Vietnamese people to achieve a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam.

The communique focused on the good results and great significance of the recent visit of the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, headed by President Ho Chi Minh, to the Soviet Union, China, and Mongolia. The communique pointed out that the Soviet government and the government of the People's Republic of China firmly support the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in consolidating peace, completing unification, and ensuring the country's complete independence and democratic political struggle.

The communique went on to point out that American imperialists are intensifying their interference in South Vietnam. They are urging their agents to oppose the Geneva Accords, brazenly refusing to hold consultative conferences, engaging in provocative activities against the International Supervisory and Control Commission, and implementing a cowardly fascist policy. American imperialists are also continuing to strengthen the military forces of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime, openly transporting new weapons and military personnel into South Vietnam, with the aim of turning South Vietnam into an American military base. In the face of the blatant interference of American imperialists, the French government is shirking its responsibilities and refusing to strictly implement the Geneva Accords.

The communique stated that the current task of the entire Vietnam Workers' Party and all the Vietnamese people is to unite all national democratic and peace-loving forces from North to South, to form a broad national united front with appropriate policies to oppose American imperialists and their agents, to strive to achieve national unification by peaceful methods and on the basis of independence and democracy, and at the same time to strive to consolidate peace and prevent the recurrence of war in Indochina.

The communique also said that a pressing task for the Vietnamese people now is to wage a struggle to urge the South Vietnamese authorities to hold consultative conferences with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to discuss the issue of general elections.

The communique pointed out that in order to win this struggle, it is necessary to strive to consolidate North Vietnam while giving sufficient attention to South Vietnam. In consolidating North Vietnam, due importance must be given to economic recovery. Land reform must be completed according to plan, and efforts must be made to develop production, with increased agricultural production as the main goal.

The communique stated that in order to accomplish these tasks, it is necessary to further strengthen the ideological leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party, further consolidate its organization, and further improve its work style.

    公报在谈到国际形势时指出，虽然整个国际局势已经有了某种程度的缓和，然而，导致国际紧张局势的原因仍然存在，而且印度支那以及远东其他一些地区的局势仍旧是紧张的。美帝国主义者继续在竭力推行他们破坏这些地区的和平的计划。
    公报说，在国内方面，北越的完全解放为全体越南人民争取实现一个和平、统一、独立、民主和繁荣的越南的斗争创造了巩固的基础。

    公报接着指出，美帝国主义者正变本加厉地在干涉南越。他们促使他们的代理人来反对日内瓦协议，悍然拒绝举行协商会议，对国际监督和监察委员会采取挑衅活动，实行一种怯懦的法西斯政策。美帝国主义者还继续增强吴庭艳政权的军事力量，公开把新的武器和军事人员运入南越，目的是要把南越变成美国的军事基地。在美帝国主义者的无耻干涉面前，法国政府推卸它的责任，并且拒绝严格地履行日内瓦协议。
    公报说，整个越南劳动党和全体越南人民当前的任务是团结从北到南的所有民族民主和爱好和平的力量，组成具有适当政策的广泛的民族统一战线，来反对美帝国主义者和他们的代理人，努力以和平方法并且在独立民主的基础上实现国家统一，同时努力巩固和平，防止印度支那战争再起。
    公报又说，越南人民现在的一项迫切任务就是进行斗争以促使南越当局同越南民主共和国政府举行讨论普选问题的协商会议。
    公报指出，为了赢得这场斗争，必须努力巩固北越，同时给南越以足够的注意。在巩固北越方面，必须给经济恢复以应有的重视。土地改革必须按计划完成，必须努力发展生产，而以增加农业生产为主要目标。
    公报说，为了完成这些任务，必须进一步加强越南劳动党的思想领导，进一步巩固它的组织，并且进一步改善它的工作作风。
