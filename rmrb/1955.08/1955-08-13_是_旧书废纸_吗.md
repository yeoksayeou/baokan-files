    Are "Old Books Waste Paper"?
    Yang Fan
    In December 1954, staff members of the Shanxi Provincial Public Security organs discovered some state secret documents mixed in with old books and waste paper being sold by a secondhand dealer in Taiyuan. Upon further investigation, they uncovered and recovered as many as 4,000 pieces of secret documents and materials, weighing more than 500 jin. Tracing the source, it turned out that the Shanxi Administrative Cadre School had sold these secret documents along with the old books and waste paper.

    These secret documents included internal Party publications, confidential notes, secret business materials, work instructions and summaries, and even important reports from central and local leaders. One can imagine that if this batch of secret documents were bought by the enemy, they could obtain what they call "important intelligence" cheaply; they could effortlessly understand and grasp our work principles, decisions, deployments, and measures in a certain area, region, or even the entire country during a certain period; thereby enabling the enemy to fully "study the situation," "divine the direction," and "determine countermeasures," and carry out insidious sabotage activities targeting our vulnerabilities.

    These secret documents also included a batch of archival materials of cadres and students, such as qualifications, evaluations, self-criticisms, and disciplinary actions. Although fragmented and incomplete, the enemy could still study our internal ideological and cadre conditions from them, find our internal weaknesses and vulnerable elements, and then slander those who could be slandered, assassinate those who could be assassinated, exploit those who could be exploited, and even pull out those who could be pulled out, in order to find their internal accomplices and helpers within the revolutionary camp.

    In this batch of "old books and waste paper," there were also many letterheads, badges, armbands, appraisal forms, exit permits, and blank letters of introduction printed with the names of institutions and official seals. Moreover, some of them were clearly stamped with the official seals of the school and the Party branch. Let us imagine: once these ready-made documents, or documents that could be used with slight forgery, fall into the hands of the enemy, they could disguise themselves as "revolutionary cadres" with backgrounds and identities, easily infiltrate some of our organs, schools, and factories, and walk in and out, rampage, and arbitrarily carry out various criminal sabotage activities.

    Don't many people think that "there are no secrets in cultural and educational departments" and that "secrecy is only the business of confidential personnel"? Now it seems that this idea is completely wrong. Some people also think that this is an unintentional mistake and should be forgiven; but everyone should not forget that divulging military and state secrets, from a political point of view, is the same whether intentional or unintentional. Regardless of whether the Shanxi Administrative Cadre School had any bad motives subjectively, or whether there were any "reasons" that could be forgiven, objectively, it undoubtedly played a role in helping the enemy. What difference is there between this and handing over state secrets and documents to the enemy with both hands?

    Perhaps some people will say: "This was last year's matter, and it won't happen again now." However, according to existing materials, the matter of selling secret documents mixed in with old books and waste paper, the matter of leaking internal news casually, the matter of losing a large number of drawings and materials due to lax systems, and so on, are not non-existent now, nor are they few, but many. There is still serious paralysis within us, and there are still many gaps available for the enemy to exploit. If we do not raise a high degree of vigilance, we will suffer greatly in the future.

    The seriousness of the problem lies not only in the matter itself, but especially in the fact that there are indeed many people within us who have serious right-leaning paralysis. In today's increasingly sharp class struggle, there is such a sentiment, which is to disarm one's own ideological armor. Therefore, we must regard this phenomenon as a dangerous tendency within the revolutionary camp and overcome it by all means.

    Now, it should be time for those numb people to wake up. Let us shout loudly to them: A severe struggle is ahead, wake up quickly!

    是“旧书废纸”吗
    杨凡
    一九五四年十二月间，山西省公安机关的工作人员在太原市发现一个旧货商出卖的旧书废纸中，夹有一些国家的秘密文件。接着细查下去，竟一下查出并收回了多至四千余件、重达五百余斤的秘密文件和资料。追查来源，原来是山西行政干部学校在出卖旧书废纸的时候，把这些秘密文件一起卖出去的。
    这些秘密文件里面，有党内刊物，有保密笔记，有业务秘密资料，有工作指示、总结，更有中央和地方首长的重要报告。可以想像，这批秘密文件如果被敌人买去，敌人就能廉价得到他们所说的“重要情报”；就能毫不费力地了解和掌握我们一个方面、一个地区以至整个国家在一定时期的工作方针、决策、部署、措施；从而也就能够使敌人充分地“研究情况”，“窥测方向”，“决定对策”，针对我们的要害处，进行阴谋破坏活动。
    这些秘密文件里面还有一批干部、学员的资历、鉴定、检讨、处分等档案材料。虽然是零碎不全的，但敌人仍然可以从中研究我们内部的思想状况和干部状况，寻找我们内部的薄弱环节和脆弱分子，然后，也就可以诬陷那些能够诬陷的，暗害那些能够暗害的，利用那些可能被利用的，甚至拉出那些可能拉出去的，以便在革命阵营内部找到他们的内应和助手。
    在这批“旧书废纸”中，还夹卖了不少印署着机关衔名的信笺、证章、臂章、鉴定表、出门证和空白介绍信之类，而且，其中有些还分明地盖着学校和党总支的公章。让我们设想一下吧：这些现成的证件，或稍加伪造就可以利用的证件，一旦落到敌人的手里，他们就可以把自己扮成一个有来历、有身份的“革命干部”，十分方便地混进我们某些机关、学校、工厂，而走进走出，横冲直闯，任意进行各种罪恶的破坏勾当了。
    不是有不少人认为“文教部门没有什么机密”，“保密只是机要人员的事”吗？现在看来，这种想法是完全不对的。也有人认为这是无心的错误，应该原谅；但是大家不应该忘记，泄露军事和国家机密，就政治观点来说，不论有意无意，横竖都是一样。不管山西行政干部学校在主观上没有什么不好的动机，或者还有什么可以谅解的“理由”，但在客观上却无疑是起了帮助敌人的作用，这和把国家机密和证件双手捧给敌人又有什么区别呢？
    也许有人要说：“这已是去年的事，现在不会再有了。”但是，根据现有的材料，夹杂在旧书废纸一起卖出秘密文件的事，信口随笔泄露内部消息的事，制度不严丢失大量图纸、资料的事，等等，现在不是没有，也不是很少，而是很多。我们内部还有严重的麻痹现象，还有可供敌人利用的不少空隙。如不引起高度的警惕，将来我们会大吃苦头的。
    问题的严重，不仅仅在于这个事情的本身，而特别是在于我们内部确有不少的人，有着严重的右倾麻痹思想。在阶级斗争日趋尖锐的今天，有这样一种情绪，就是解除了自己的思想武装。因此我们必须把这种现象看做革命阵营内部的一种危险倾向，要用一切方法加以克服。
    现在，应该是那些麻木不仁的人清醒的时候了。让我们向他们大喊一声：严重的斗争正在前头，你们赶快醒来吧！
