Shanghai, Wuhan, Shenyang, Chongqing, and other places are also printing it and it will be distributed soon.
    This historically significant document, which is beginning to be distributed, includes, before the text of the Five-Year Plan itself, the "Resolution of the National Conference of the Communist Party of China on the Draft of the First Five-Year Plan for Development of the National Economy of the People's Republic of China," the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Draft of the First Five-Year Plan for Development of the National Economy of the People's Republic of China to the State Council of the People's Republic of China," the "Resolution of the State Council of the People's Republic of China on the Adoption of the Draft of the First Five-Year Plan for Development of the National Economy of the People's Republic of China," and the "Resolution of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China on the Development of the National Economy's First Five-Year Plan." After the main text of the Five-Year Plan, it includes "Report on the First Five-Year Plan for Development of the National Economy" made at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress by Li Fuchun, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the State Planning Commission.
    The text of the "First Five-Year Plan for Development of the National Economy of the People's Republic of China" (hereinafter referred to as the "Five-Year Plan") is divided into eleven chapters: "Introduction," "The Tasks of the First Five-Year Plan," "Investment Allocation and Production Targets of the First Five-Year Plan," "Industry," "Agriculture," "Transportation and Postal Services," "Commerce," "Planned Targets for Improving Labor Productivity and Reducing Costs," "Training Construction Cadres and Strengthening Scientific Research," "Improving the People's Material and Cultural Living Standards," "Local Planning Issues," and "Practice Thrift and Oppose Waste."
    The introduction to the "Five-Year Plan" first analyzes the situation in our country during the period of national economic recovery, and the extremely backward state of our original economy, the absolute dominance of small-scale farming in the agricultural economy, and the considerable proportion of capitalist economy in the national economy, pointing out that we must implement a policy of active socialist industrialization to improve the level of our country's productivity and, at the same time, gradually implement socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce.
    The introduction states that the compilation of the Five-Year Plan focused on the following issues: First, under the condition of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, strive to maintain appropriate proportions between the development of various economic sectors. Second, strive to make the construction plan compatible with the degree of capital accumulation, and appropriately estimate technical capabilities. Third, combine local plans with the plans of various central ministries. Fourth, adopt a step-by-step approach that combines the rational utilization of existing industrial bases with the active establishment of new industrial bases, gradually changing the past state of unbalanced economic development, and adapting the layout of economic construction to the conditions of national defense security. Fifth, take into account the need to expand capital accumulation to ensure national construction and establish a material foundation for continuously improving the people's living standards, while gradually improving the people's living standards on the basis of developing production and improving labor productivity.
    The introduction fully estimates the difficulties in achieving the first Five-Year Plan, and points out the importance of the support of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, and of learning from the Soviet Union.
    The introduction points out that we must defeat any form of sabotage of the Five-Year Plan by domestic and foreign enemies; and emphasizes that we must continuously consolidate the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class, and consolidate the people's democratic united front based on the worker-peasant alliance.
    Chapter 1 of the "Five-Year Plan" proposes the basic tasks of the first Five-Year Plan, based on the overall tasks of the country during the transition period. The basic tasks of the first Five-Year Plan can be summarized as follows: concentrate major efforts on industrial construction centered on the 156 industrial units designed with Soviet assistance, consisting of 694 construction units above the quota, and establish the initial foundation of China's socialist industrialization; develop some collectively owned agricultural production cooperatives, and develop handicraft production cooperatives, establishing a preliminary foundation for the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts; and basically bring capitalist industry and commerce into various forms of state capitalism, establishing the foundation for the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. This is a program of decisive significance for the Communist Party of China and the state organs of the People's Republic of China to lead the people of the whole country in striving to realize the general tasks of the transition period.
    Around these basic tasks, the first Five-Year Plan also stipulates twelve specific tasks.
    According to the above tasks, Chapter 2 of the "Five-Year Plan" stipulates the allocation of basic construction investment, and the basic indicators of production, transportation, and commodity circulation for the five years.
    From the ratio of the total state expenditure on economic and cultural education undertakings and the allocation of basic construction investment in the five years, it can be seen that the focus of the allocation is industry, especially in basic construction investment, industry occupies the most important position, accounting for 58.2 percent of the total investment. In industrial basic construction investment, the proportion of investment in the manufacturing of means of production industries is particularly large, accounting for 88.8 percent. This is because our country needs to actively expand the foundation of heavy industry to promote the comprehensive development of the national economy.
    During the first Five-Year Plan period, agricultural production cannot be widely mechanized, and larger-scale water conservancy construction and forestry construction cannot be fully developed, so the state's investment in agriculture, water conservancy, and forestry is still not large. However, the total expenditure directly and indirectly used by the state to develop agricultural production in the five years is 8.4 billion yuan, plus the preliminary estimated investment of farmers themselves for expanding reproduction, the total funds used to develop agriculture in the five years will still be about 18.4 billion yuan.
    The "Five-Year Plan" stipulates that in the five years, the total industrial output value will increase by 98.3 percent, the total handicraft output value will increase by 60.9 percent, and the total output value of agriculture and its sideline industries will increase by 23.3 percent; the total industrial and agricultural output value will increase by 51.1 percent. The proportion of modern industry in the total industrial and agricultural output value will increase from 26.7 percent in 1952 to 36 percent in 1957. The proportion of output value of state-owned, cooperative-operated, and joint state-private industries in the total industrial output value will increase from 61 percent to 87.8 percent, and the proportion of private industries will decrease from 39 percent to 12.2 percent. The total retail sales of social commodities nationwide will increase by about 80 percent. By 1957, state-owned commercial and cooperative-operated commercial enterprises will account for 54.9 percent of the total retail sales of social commodities, various forms of state capitalist commercial enterprises and cooperative forms of small commercial enterprises organized by small merchants and peddlers will account for 24 percent, and private commercial enterprises will account for 21.1 percent.
    Starting from Chapter 3, the "Five-Year Plan" makes specific provisions by category for the tasks, development scale, indicators, and various measures to ensure the completion of tasks in various economic and cultural education departments.
    Chapter 3—Industry, occupies almost one-third of the entire "Five-Year Plan."
    The "Five-Year Plan" points out that the industrial basic construction plan is the center of the Five-Year Plan. The purpose of industrial basic construction, with heavy industry as the main focus, is to advance our country's national economy from an extremely backward technical state to the track of modern technology, and to create a modern technical foundation for our country's industry, agriculture, and transportation. In the first five years, major investments will be concentrated to ensure the construction of key projects designed with Soviet assistance and their directly supporting projects, and at the same time, appropriate funds will be used to systematically renovate and build a number of small and medium-sized factories and mines.
    The first Five-Year Plan makes reasonable arrangements for the regional distribution of industrial basic construction. That is: rationally utilize the existing industrial base in Northeast China, Shanghai, and other cities, basically complete the construction of the Northeast industrial base centered on the Anshan Iron and Steel Complex; actively carry out the construction of new industrial areas in North China, Northwest China, and Central China, so that during the second Five-Year Plan period, two new industrial bases centered on the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex and the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex will be formed in these areas respectively; start part of the industrial construction in Southwest China, and actively prepare various conditions for the construction of new industrial bases. The "Five-Year Plan" emphasizes the importance of mineral resource exploration, pointing out that geological work should be greatly strengthened to catch up with the needs of industrial construction.
    The "Five-Year Plan" then stipulates the growth targets for the output of 46 major industrial products. From these planned figures, it can be seen that the growth of the production of means of production is faster than the growth of the production of consumer goods, which is in line with the requirements of expanded reproduction of our country's national economy. The "Five-Year Plan" points out that in addition to the fact that newly built and renovated enterprises should strive to put into production as early as possible on the premise of ensuring project quality, it is necessary to pay attention to the production work of existing enterprises, give full play to the potential strength of existing enterprises, and strive to overfulfill the industrial production plan.
    Next, the "Five-Year Plan" makes specific provisions and explanations for heavy industry (including steel, non-ferrous metals, electricity, coal mines, petroleum, machinery manufacturing, chemical industry, building materials, wood industry, etc.), light industry (including textile, food, medicine, paper making, and other industries), local industry, the utilization, restriction, and transformation of capitalist industry, and handicrafts. The "Five-Year Plan" points out that private industry occupies an important position in various industries belonging to the means of livelihood industry, and also occupies a considerable position in certain industries belonging to the means of production industry. It stipulates that most of the private industry will be transformed into various forms of state capitalism. By 1957, there will be about 8,000 joint state-private industrial enterprises, and it stipulates that in the process of transformation, reasonable arrangements will be made for the production and capitalists themselves in various industries of private industry. The "Five-Year Plan" also emphasizes the important position of our country's handicraft industry, pointing out that handicraft production should be systematically guided, and handicraft workers should be gradually led to the road of cooperation.
    Chapter 4 of the "Five-Year Plan" points out that developing agriculture is a basic condition for ensuring the development of industry and the completion of the entire economic plan. The first Five-Year Plan must strive to overcome the danger of separation between agriculture and industry in the development process, strengthen the worker-peasant alliance and urban-rural economic exchanges, promote a new upsurge in the agricultural economy, and ensure that grain, cotton, oil crops, and other technical crops have the necessary increase every year, especially to ensure the increase in the foundation of various agricultural productions, that is, grain production.
    The "Five-Year Plan" stipulates production increase plans for various major crops, of which grain output will increase by 17.6 percent, and cotton output will increase by 25.4 percent; and points out that these are the necessary requirements put forward by the state for the production of some major crops, and the greatest efforts should be made to achieve them and strive to overfulfill them.
    The agricultural cooperation plan is a great component of the Five-Year Plan. The "Five-Year Plan" stipulates that by 1957, farmers participating in the existing primary form of agricultural production cooperatives will account for about one-third of the total number of farmers in the country. Among them, the scale of cooperation in the northeastern provinces, Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and other old liberated areas may reach about half of the farmers. In technical crop areas and urban suburbs, efforts will be made to strive for cooperation one step ahead. This plan will be very important for promoting the development of agriculture and ensuring the realization of the entire economic plan, and it is of decisive significance for restricting and gradually eliminating the rich peasant economy. The "Five-Year Plan" also estimates that the individual agricultural economy still has certain potential strength, and it must be correctly and fully utilized to increase the yield per unit area.
    In order to promote agricultural cooperation, improve agricultural technology, and ensure the completion of the agricultural production plan, the "Five-Year Plan" puts forward many important measures.
    Chapter 4 of the "Five-Year Plan" also makes provisions and explanations for animal husbandry and aquatic industry, water conservancy construction, forestry construction, and meteorological construction respectively.
    Chapter 5 of the "Five-Year Plan" stipulates the development plan for transportation and postal services, and stipulates the transportation volume indicators for major transportation departments. The constantly increasing transportation volume in the five years will be largely borne by the existing railways, so more than half of the basic construction investment in railways will be used to strengthen and renovate the existing railways. In the five years, more than 4,000 kilometers of new railway trunk lines and branch lines will be built, mainly including the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the Jining-Erlian Railway, the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, the Yingtan-Xiamen Line, the Leizhou-Zhanjiang Railway, the Fengtai-Shacheng Line, and the Beijing-Chengde Line. In the five years, the newly added ships will have a deadweight tonnage of 400,000 tons. The main task of waterway transportation is to develop inland river transportation, focusing on the Yangtze River, and appropriately develop maritime transportation at the same time. In the five years, the state will invest in the construction of more than 10,000 kilometers of highways, and the main aspect of the construction is the highways in the southwestern minority areas and important highways in the border areas and coastal areas. The development of civil aviation is mainly to strengthen the connection between the capital and major cities and remote areas; at the same time, in order to meet the needs of agriculture, forestry, and geological exploration, professional flights will be developed. The main aspect of postal and telecommunications construction is to strengthen the communication connections between the capital and various important cities and new industrial cities, and to cooperate with the needs of the construction of new industrial cities.
    In Chapter 6—Commerce, the "Five-Year Plan" particularly emphasizes the need to continue to maintain the stability of the market. Since the growth rate of people's purchasing power will exceed the growth rate of consumer goods production, the state must gradually implement a policy of planned purchase and planned supply, depending on the different circumstances of the production of major commodities, in order to systematically grasp the source of goods and organize supply, severely combat speculators, and prevent private merchants from manipulating the market. The "Five-Year Plan" also emphasizes the need to vigorously consolidate and strengthen the unified leadership and unified regulation of state-owned commerce in the market, and strengthen the position of cooperative-operated commerce in the market. The socialist transformation of private commerce should be carried out steadily according to market conditions, distinguishing between capitalist commerce and independent small commerce. Under the unified planning of the state, state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives will be divided into labor and be responsible for advancing on one side and arranging on the other.
    Lenin pointed out: "Labor productivity is ultimately the most important and the most important condition for ensuring the victory of the new social system." In Chapter 7 of the "Five-Year Plan," specific provisions are made for the planned targets for improving labor productivity and reducing costs. In the five years, the labor productivity of state-owned industry will increase by 64 percent, and the labor productivity of construction and installation of industrial basic construction units will increase by 72 percent; the product cost of various central industrial ministries will be reduced by about 22 percent, the commodity circulation costs of state-owned trade will be reduced by about 33 percent, and costs must also be reduced to the greatest extent in basic construction.
    The "Five-Year Plan" also points out that labor competition is a regular and effective method of improving labor productivity, and labor competition should be continuously pushed to a new upsurge.
    The large-scale economic construction of the country requires a large number of cadres who are loyal to the motherland, loyal to the socialist cause, and have a certain cultural, technical level and certain business ability, especially industrial technical cadres. Chapter 8 of the "Five-Year Plan" stipulates that the state will systematically adjust, expand, and establish various types of higher and secondary vocational schools, and fully utilize the favorable conditions of enterprises and institutions to train and cultivate construction talents and improve the theoretical, policy, business, cultural, and technical levels of on-the-job cadres. In the five years, the number of students in colleges and secondary vocational schools has greatly increased. Among them, the number of students in engineering and agriculture and forestry has increased even more. In the five years, 10,100 students will be sent to the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, and 11,300 interns. The relevant central ministries and various types of enterprises will train a large number of skilled workers.
    In the five years, according to the current and long-term needs of national construction, scientific research institutions will be appropriately expanded, and scientific research plans will be formulated to promote our country's scientific research. During the first Five-Year Plan period, the research institutions under the Chinese Academy of Sciences will increase by 23, and the focus of research work includes research on the peaceful utilization of atomic energy, research to cooperate with the construction of new steel bases, and research on petroleum, etc., with eleven items.
    Chapter 9 of the "Five-Year Plan" stipulates the improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards.
    In terms of material living standards, the number of employed workers and staff will increase by 4.2 million in the five years, and the average wage will increase by about 33 percent. In the five years, the labor insurance funds, medical expenses, welfare expenses, and cultural education expenses paid by state-owned enterprises and state organs will total more than 5 billion yuan. The workers and staff housing built with state appropriations will be about 46 million square meters. The "Five-Year Plan" explains from all aspects that the lives of farmers will be further improved, and the purchasing power of rural people will increase by nearly one time. Specific indicators are also stipulated for an important aspect of the people's life welfare—the development of health and medical undertakings.
    In terms of cultural living standards, ordinary school education undertakings will have appropriate development according to the conditions of teachers and national financial resources, and fully utilize the human resources and equipment of the original schools; at the same time, it is advocated that farmers run schools themselves, and private individuals are allowed to run schools. In the five years, the spare-time education of cadres and workers and peasants will be actively and widely carried out. The number of people eliminating illiteracy is 23 million.
    The "Five-Year Plan" puts forward tasks and indicators for the development of publishing and distribution, broadcasting, literature and art, film, cultural centers, libraries, museums, and other undertakings. Finally, it specifically stipulates the cultural construction of minority areas.
    Local plans are an integral part of the unified national plan. Chapter 10 of the "Five-Year Plan" points out that when formulating and implementing local plans, all localities must mobilize and utilize all internal resources of the locality and organize the activities of various economic sectors and various economic components in the locality to complete and overfulfill the tasks assigned to the locality by the national plan, thereby ensuring the needs of national key construction and promoting the economic and cultural development of the locality. The "Five-Year Plan" lists the issues that should be paid attention to in local plans for agriculture, industry, transportation, commerce, culture and education, and urban construction.
    The "Five-Year Plan" emphasizes in its final chapter that it is necessary to implement a strict system of thrift, eliminate all superfluous expenditures and inappropriate non-productive expenditures, and no slight waste is allowed, in order to accumulate all possible funds to ensure the needs of national construction and increase the necessary national reserves. Our country is still an economically backward and very poor country. To change this backward and poor state and build a prosperous and happy socialist society, it is impossible without the long-term arduous and self-sacrificing efforts of the Communist Party of China leading the people of the whole country. The "Five-Year Plan" puts forward the tasks of thrift in basic construction, the production and circulation of state-owned enterprises, and state organs at all levels, and criticizes the various waste phenomena that currently exist.
    In order to successfully complete and strive to overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan, and enable the first Five-Year Plan to create a good start for long-term economic construction in the future, the "Five-Year Plan" calls for a regular and comprehensive movement to practice strict thrift and oppose waste to be launched nationwide, and this movement should first be launched in state organs and state-owned enterprises.

    “中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划”出版
    “中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划”已由人民出版社出版，定十三日开始在北京发行。上海、武汉、沈阳、重庆等地也在印刷，即将发行。
    开始发行的这一重大历史意义的文献，在五年计划本文之前，刊载了“中国共产党全国代表会议关于中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案的决议”、“中国共产党中央委员会关于中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案致中华人民共和国国务院的信”、“中华人民共和国国务院关于通过中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案的决议”和“中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的决议”。在五年计划本文之后，并刊载了国务院副总理兼国家计划委员会主任李富春在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上所作的“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”。
    “中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划”（以下简称“五年计划”）本文，共分“绪言”和“第一个五年计划的任务”、“第一个五年计划的投资分配和生产指标”、“工业”、“农业”、“运输和邮电”、“商业”、“提高劳动生产率和降低成本的计划指标”、“培养建设干部，加强科学研究工作”、“提高人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平”、“地方计划问题”和“厉行节约，反对浪费”等十一章。
    “五年计划”的绪言部分首先对我国国民经济恢复时期的情况和我国原来经济极端落后、小农经济在农业经济中还占有绝对优势、资本主义经济在国民经济中还占有相当大的比重等情况，作了分析，指出我们必须实行积极的社会主义工业化的政策来提高我国生产力的水平，同时，必须对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业逐步实行社会主义的改造。
    绪言说明，五年计划的编制着重注意了以下问题：第一，在优先发展重工业的条件下，力求使各个经济部门之间的发展保持适当的比例。第二，力求使建设计划同资金积累的程度相适应，并适当地估计到技术力量。第三，使地方的计划同中央各部的计划结合起来。第四，采取合理地利用原有工业基地和积极地着手创设新的工业基地互相结合的步骤，逐步改变过去的经济发展不平衡的状态，并使经济建设的布局适应于国防安全的条件。第五，照顾到既要扩大资金积累，保证国家建设，为不断地提高人民生活水平建立物质基础，同时要在发展生产和提高劳动生产率的基础上逐步地提高人民的生活水平。
    绪言充分估计了实现第一个五年计划的困难，并指出苏联和各人民民主国家的支援和学习苏联的重要意义。
    绪言指出，必须击破国内国外敌人对于五年计划任何形式的破坏活动；并强调必须不断地巩固工人阶级领导下的工农联盟，巩固以工农联盟为基础的人民民主统一战线。
    “五年计划”第一章，根据国家在过渡时期的总任务，提出了第一个五年计划的基本任务。第一个五年计划的基本任务，概括地说来就是：集中主要力量进行以苏联帮助我国设计的一五六个工业单位为中心的、由限额以上的六九四个建设单位组成的工业建设，建立我国的社会主义工业化的初步基础；发展部分集体所有制的农业生产合作社，并发展手工业生产合作社，建立对于农业和手工业的社会主义改造的初步基础；基本上把资本主义工商业分别地纳入各种形式的国家资本主义的轨道，建立对于私营工商业的社会主义改造的基础。这是中国共产党和中华人民共和国国家机关领导全国人民为实现过渡时期总任务而奋斗的带有决定意义的纲领。
    围绕着这些基本任务，第一个五年计划又规定了十二项具体任务。
    根据上述任务，“五年计划”第二章对五年内关于基本建设投资的分配，关于生产、运输和商品流通的基本指标，作了规定。
    从五年内国家对经济事业、文化教育事业支出总数和基本建设投资的分配比例，可以看出，分配的重点是工业，特别是在基本建设投资中，工业占有最重要的地位，占全部投资百分之五十八点二。在工业基本建设投资中，制造生产资料工业的投资占的比重特别大，占百分之八十八点八。这是因为我国需要积极地扩大重工业的基础以促进国民经济的全面发展。
    在第一个五年计划期间，农业生产还不可能广泛地实现机械化，更大规模的水利建设和林业建设也还不能全面展开，所以国家对农业、水利、林业方面的投资还不多。但是国家在五年内直接和间接用于发展农业生产的支出共达八十四亿元，加上初步估算的农民自己用于扩大再生产的投资，五年内用于发展农业的全部资金仍将有一百八十四亿元左右。
    “五年计划”规定：五年内，工业总产值增长百分之九十八点三，手工业总产值增长百分之六十点九，农业及其副业的总产值增长百分之二十三点三；工业农业总产值合计将增长百分之五十一点一。现代工业在工业农业总产值中的比重将由一九五二年的百分之二十六点七上升到一九五七年的百分之三十六。国营、合作社营、公私合营工业的产值在工业总产值中所占的比重将由百分之六十一上升到百分之八十七点八，私营工业所占的比重将由百分之三十九下降为百分之十二点二。全国社会商品零售总额增长百分之八十左右，到一九五七年，在社会商品零售总额中，国营商业和合作社营商业将占百分之五十四点九，各种国家资本主义形式的商业和由小商小贩组织起来的合作形式的小商业将占百分之二十四，私营商业将占百分之二十一点一。
    “五年计划”从第三章开始，对经济和文化教育各部门的任务、发展规模、指标以及保证完成任务的各种措施，分门别类地作了具体的规定。
    第三章——工业，几乎占了全部“五年计划”三分之一的篇幅。
    “五年计划”指出，工业基本建设计划是五年计划的中心。以重工业为主的工业基本建设的目的，是要把我国国民经济从技术极端落后的状况推进到现代化技术的轨道上，而为我国的工业、农业和运输业创造现代化的技术基础。在第一个五年内，将集中主要的投资来保证苏联帮助我国设计的重点工程及其直接配合的工程的建设，同时用适当的资金来有计划地改建和新建若干中小型的厂矿。
    第一个五年计划对于工业基本建设的地区分布，作了合理的部署。这就是：合理地利用东北、上海和其他城市已有的工业基础，基本上完成以鞍山钢铁联合企业为中心的东北工业基地的建设；积极地进行华北、西北、华中等地新的工业地区的建设，以便第二个五年计划期间在这些地区分别组成以包头钢铁联合企业和武汉钢铁联合企业为中心的两个新的工业基地；在西南开始部分的工业建设，并积极地准备新工业基地建设的各种条件。“五年计划”强调矿产资源勘探的重要，指出应该大大地加强地质工作，赶上工业建设的需要。
    “五年计划”接着规定了四十六种主要工业品产量的增长指标。从这些计划数字可以看出，生产资料生产的增长要快于消费资料生产的增长，这是适合于我国国民经济扩大再生产的要求的。“五年计划”指出，除了新建和改建的企业应该在保证工程质量的前提下，争取提早投入生产以外，必须重视现有企业的生产工作，充分发挥现有企业的潜在力量，争取超额完成工业生产计划。
    接着，“五年计划”分别对重工业（包括钢铁、有色金属、电力、煤矿、石油、机器制造、化学、建筑材料、木材等工业），轻工业（包括纺织、食品、医药、造纸以及其他工业），地方工业，资本主义工业的利用、限制和改造，以及手工业，作了具体的规定和说明。“五年计划”指出，私营工业在属于生活资料工业的各行业中占有重要的地位，在属于生产资料工业的某些行业中也占有相当的地位，规定私营工业大部分将转变为各种形式的国家资本主义，到一九五七年，公私合营工业企业将达到八千个左右，并规定在改造过程中将对私营工业的各行业的生产和资本家本人进行合理的安排。“五年计划”并强调了我国手工业的重要地位，指出应该有计划地指导手工业生产，逐步地把手工业者引向合作化的道路。
    “五年计划”第四章指出，发展农业是保证工业发展和全部经济计划完成的基本条件。第一个五年计划必须努力地克服农业和工业在发展过程中彼此脱节的危险，加强工农联盟和城乡经济交流，促进农业经济的新高涨，保证粮食、棉花、油料和其他技术作物在每年都有必要的增加，特别是要保证各种农业生产的基础即粮食生产的增加。
    “五年计划”对各种主要农作物规定了增产计划，其中粮食的产量增加百分之十七点六，棉花的产量增加百分之二十五点四；并指出，这是国家对一些主要农作物生产所提出的必需的要求，应该尽最大的努力加以实现，并争取超额完成。
    农业合作化计划是五年计划的伟大组成部分。“五年计划”规定：到一九五七年参加现有的初级形式的农业生产合作社的农户将占全国农户总数的三分之一左右。其中，东北各省、山西、河北、山东、河南和其他老解放区，合作化的规模可能达到农户半数左右。在技术作物地区和城市郊区，将努力争取先一步地合作化。这个计划对于促进农业的发展和保证全部经济计划的实现将是很重要的，对于限制和逐步消灭富农经济有决定的意义。“五年计划”也估计了农业个体经济还有一定的潜在力量，必须正确地充分地把它发挥出来，提高单位面积产量。
    为着促进农业合作化和提高农业技术，保证农业生产计划的完成，“五年计划”提出了许多重要的措施。
    “五年计划”第四章，同时对畜牧业和水产业、水利建设、林业建设、气象建设分别作了规定和说明。
    “五年计划”第五章规定了运输和邮电的发展计划，规定了主要运输部门的运输量指标。五年内不断增加的运输量，绝大部分将由现有铁路负担，因此铁路的基本建设投资半数以上将用于加强和改造现有铁路。五年内新建铁路干线和支线有四千多公里，主要的有兰新铁路、宝成铁路、集宁—二连线、包兰铁路、鹰潭—厦门线、黎湛铁路、丰台—沙城线、北京—承德线等八条。五年内新增轮船四十万载重吨。水路运输的主要任务是发展内河运输，以长江为重点，同时适当地发展海上运输。五年内由中央投资修建的公路共一万公里以上，修建的主要方面是西南少数民族地区的公路和边疆、沿海重要的公路。民用航空的发展，主要是加强首都同各地区主要城市和边远地区的联系；同时，为着适应农业、林业和地质勘探等工作的需要，发展专业飞行。邮电建设的主要方面是加强首都同各重要城市和新的工业城市的通讯联系，并配合新工业城市建设的需要。
    在第六章——商业中，“五年计划”特别强调要继续保持市场的稳定。由于人民购买力的增长速度将超过消费品生产的增长速度，国家必须分别主要商品生产的不同情况，逐步地推行计划收购和计划供应的政策，以便有计划地掌握货源和组织供应，严厉地同投机商作斗争，不让私商有操纵市场的可能。“五年计划”同时强调要大力巩固和加强国营商业在市场上的统一领导、统一调节的作用，并加强合作社营商业在市场上的阵地。对于私营商业的社会主义改造，应该根据市场情况，分别资本主义商业和独立小商业，稳步地进行。在国家统一筹划下，由国营商业部门和供销合作社分工负责，一面前进，一面安排。
    列宁指出：“劳动生产率归根到底是保证新社会制度胜利的最重要最主要的条件。”在“五年计?划”的第七章内，专门对提高劳动生产率和降低成本的计划指标作了具体的规定。五年内，国营工业的劳动生产率将提高百分之六十四，工业基本建设单位建筑安装的劳动生产率将提高百分之七十二；中央各工业部产品成本约降低百分之二十二，国营贸易商品流通费约降低百分之三十三，在基本建设方面也必须最大限度地降低成本。
    “五年计划”并且指出，劳动竞赛是提高劳动生产率经常的有效的方法，应该不断地把劳动竞赛推向新的高涨。
    国家大规模经济建设的进行，需要大量的忠实于祖国、忠实于社会主义事业并具有一定文化、技术水平和一定业务能力的干部，特别是工业技术干部。“五年计划”第八章规定：国家将有计划地调整、扩大和开办各类高等和中等的专业学校，并充分地利用企业和机关的有利条件，训练培养各项建设人材，提高在职干部的理论、政策、业务、文化、技术的水平。五年内高等学校和中等专业学校的在校学生人数，都有很大增长。其中工科、农林科的学生人数有更大的增长。五年内，派遣到苏联和各人民民主国家的留学生为一万零一百人、实习生为一万一千三百人。中央有关各部和各类企业内部，都将大量地培养熟练工人。
    五年内，根据国家建设当前和长远的需要，将适当地扩充科学研究机构，制定科学研究计划，以推进我国的科学研究事业。在第一个五年计划期间，中国科学院所属研究机构将增加二十三所，研究工作的重点有原子能和平利用的研究、配合新钢铁基地建设的研究和石油的研究等十一项。
    “五年计划”第九章规定了人民物质生活和文化生活水平的提高。
    在物质生活水平方面，五年内就业工人职员人数将增加四百二十万人，平均工资约增长百分之三十三。五年内国营企业和国家机关所支付的劳动保险基金、医药费、福利费和文化教育费将共达五十亿元以上。国家拨款建筑的工人职员住宅，将约达四千六百万平方公尺。“五年计划”从各方面说明了农民的生活将得到进一步的改善，农村人民的购买力将提高近一倍。对于人民生活福利的一个重要方面——卫生、医疗事业的发展，也规定了具体指标。
    在文化生活水平方面，普通学校教育事业根据师资和国家财力的条件，并充分利用原有学校的人力和设备，将有适当的发展；同时提倡农民群众自办学校，允许私人开办学校。五年内，干部和工农群众的业余教育将得到积极地广泛地开展。扫除文盲的人数共为二千三百万人。
    “五年计划”对出版和发行、广播、文学艺术、电影、文化馆、图书馆、博物馆等事业的发展，都提出了任务和指标。最后并特别规定了少数民族地区的文化建设。
    地方计划是统一的国家计划的一个组成部分。“五年计划”第十章指出，各地方在编制和执行地方计划的时候，必须根据统一的国家计划，动员和利用本地方的一切内部资源，组织本地方各个经济部门和各种经济成份的活动，来完成和超额完成国家计划所给予本地方的任务，从而保证国家重点建设的需要，并促进本地方经济文化的发展。“五年计划”列举了地方的农业、工业、运输业、商业、文化教育、城市建设的计划应注意的问题。
    “五年计划”在它的最后一章强调指出，必须实行严格的节约制度，消除一切多余的开支和不适当的非生产的开支，不能容许任何微小的浪费，以便积聚一切可能的资金，用来保证国家建设事业的需要，并增加国家必要的后备力量。我国还是一个经济上很落后和很贫穷的国家，要改变这种落后和贫困的状态而建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会，没有中国共产党领导全国人民长期的艰苦的自我牺牲的努力，是不可能的。“五年计划”分别对基本建设、国营企业的生产和流通、各级国家机关等方面提出了节约的任务，批评了目前存在的各种浪费现象。
    为着胜利地完成和力求超额完成第一个五年计划，并使第一个五年计划能够为将来长期经济建设造成一个良好的开端，“五年计划”号召，必须在全国范围内开展一个经常性的全面的厉行节约、反对浪费的运动，而首先要在国家机关和国营企业中开展这个运动。　（新华社）
