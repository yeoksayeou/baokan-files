    Li Zhan'ao, a Model Grain Custodian
    Li Baichao
    Several months ago, comrades from the Shandong Provincial Grain Bureau told me about the outstanding achievements of the Gaojiaying Branch of the Anqiu County Thirteenth District Grain Depot in grain storage. This grain depot has fourteen locations with fifty-four rooms, distributed across three villages, storing 1.2 million catties of grain for the state. These storage facilities are dilapidated public houses and some rented simple dwellings, without even a complete courtyard. However, thanks to the efforts of the custodians, this grain depot has not experienced any incidents of grain spoilage, deterioration, theft, or fire for more than four years. In 1954, it achieved twenty-four insect-free granaries, nineteen basically insect-free granaries, and forty-five rat-free and sparrow-free granaries. In 1954, the Gaojiaying Branch reduced grain storage losses by 1,000 catties and saved 1,500 yuan in storage fees compared to other grain depots in Shandong. The custodian of this grain depot is Comrade Li Zhan'ao.
    In mid-June of this year, Shandong Province held its first representative conference of model grain custodians. Li Zhan'ao was a first-class model grain custodian from the Changwei area, attended the conference, and was selected as a first-class model grain custodian for the entire province. Taking this opportunity, I visited this model custodian and asked him how he created the "four-free granary" – free from insects, rats, sparrows, mold, and accidents.
    "The reason why the branch depot I am responsible for has become a 'four-free granary' is mainly because I have earnestly studied and applied the advanced grain storage experience of Yuhang County," Li Zhan'ao continued, "In the beginning, my thinking was not clear, and I thought that grain naturally produces insects, so how could it be insect-free? After listening to the report of the head of the County Grain Bureau (who had personally seen the insect-free granaries in Yuhang), and carefully studying the experience of Yuhang County's insect-free granaries, I woke up and realized that achieving 'insect-free' was entirely possible. After returning to the depot, I began to act according to the experience of Yuhang County. Before the grain is put into storage, thoroughly clean and sanitize to eliminate latent pests; strictly control the quality of the grain entering the warehouse and do a good job of isolated storage. After the storage is completed, immediately conduct a general survey and classification of the grain, and take different measures to deal with different insect infestations; implement a regular cleaning and sanitation system to prevent insect infestation. As a result, the insects really disappeared."
    Others told me: Although Li Zhan'ao is already forty-four years old, in order to make the grain insect-free, he works like a young man, often getting up before dawn to clean the warehouse yard, and often climbs to the beams with the workers to clean the warehouse roof and remove insect nests. As for cleaning the warehouse, whitewashing the walls, caulking mud walls, sun-drying tools, disposing of garbage, and laying the warehouse floor, he also works with the workers.
    Last summer, 330,000 catties of wheat stored in Li Zhan'ao's branch depot were severely infested with insects, and it was also a period of continuous rain. There was no other way to deal with it, so he used high temperatures to kill the insects. He sealed the warehouse tightly, used a stove to heat it up, and the walls and sacks inside the warehouse were so hot that they burned, but he wore only a single shirt and pants, going in and out to add charcoal to the stove and check the grain temperature. Sleepless nights, unable to eat, baking in the heat, and sleeping in the open air, he continued like this for twenty-seven days and nights. His eyes were red and swollen, and his ears were deaf, but when he saw that the insects were all dead and the wheat was safe, a smile appeared on his face.
    I asked him how he managed to keep the granary free of rats.
    "Regarding this, the higher authorities have already helped me summarize three experiences: strict prevention, diligent catching, and mobilizing the masses to catch rats," he said. "I first sealed the doors, windows, and rat holes of the granary tightly to prevent rats from entering. Then, I set up iron clamps and wooden box self-falling traps in the four corners of the warehouse to catch rats, check them frequently, and change the bait frequently. When turning over the warehouse or emptying the warehouse, seal the doors and windows of the warehouse tightly and carry out an encirclement and suppression. After a period of time, the rat infestation was eliminated. However, if the neighbors have rats, the rats still have the opportunity to get into the granary. So I mobilized the neighbors to catch rats. Our landlord is an old lady in her sixties. When I went to mobilize her to catch rats, she said: 'Begging for food won't make you poor, rats stealing won't make you poor.' I said: 'If you put two liters of peanuts outside, do you think the rats can steal them all!' Before I could finish speaking, she interrupted and said: 'That year I put twenty catties of peanuts in the corner of the wall, and I don't know when the rats stole them all!' I said: 'Yes! For every stone of grain, you eat eight pecks and the rats steal two pecks; but in the past you didn't notice it. Moreover, grain that has been infested by rats is easy to cause illness if you eat it.' She said in surprise: 'It seems that rats are really harmful!' 'Then you should catch them!' She said with embarrassment: 'I don't have rat traps, and I don't know how to use them!' I lent her an iron clamp and helped her set it up. She caught a rat the next day and was very happy. I taught her how to use the clamp, and she caught a rat herself. From then on, she actively started catching rats. Other neighbors also started catching rats one after another. In this way, the rats in the neighbors' houses were gradually eliminated."
    In terms of preventing grain spoilage, Li Zhan'ao does this: In addition to mobilizing the masses to dry and clean the grain before it is put into storage, before the grain is put into storage, sand is laid on the warehouse floor, and sand-filled walls are added to the lower part of the inner wall of the warehouse; then, wheat bran is used to pad the warehouse floor, and grass curtains are wrapped around the inside of the warehouse; finally, a general inspection is carried out again, paying special attention to places where there is leakage from above and dampness from below. After the grain is put into storage, take time to check it carefully, and conduct a thorough inspection of all warehouses every ten days; check promptly whenever there is wind and rain; and promptly expose high-moisture grain to the sun. This can prevent grain spoilage.
    "How do you manage to avoid accidents?" I continued to ask.
    "In addition to getting help from the local public security department, we mainly rely on the masses. Rural staff often educate the masses on protecting national grain, and the grain depot often holds meetings to commend people who have made achievements in protecting grain. I have established close ties with the masses. During the busy farming season, I help those families who are short-handed. If the grain depot needs to hire people to build warehouses, etc., I give priority to helping households in difficulty to overcome their living difficulties. Li Guangyun's family of four accidentally ate arsenic and were poisoned. Wang Jincai's child accidentally cut off half of his finger while cutting grass. I rushed to invite doctors to treat them. I also try my best to help mutual aid teams and agricultural cooperatives do some things. The masses are very good to me. They all regard protecting the safety of national grain as their glorious duty. Four neighborhood grain protection groups and worker grain protection teams have been established in the three grain storage villages. They often consciously monitor bad elements, stand guard and patrol at night, and pay special attention to guarding during festivals or film screenings. In July and August 1954, we encountered rain twice while drying grain. We were able to protect the safety of the grain with the help of the broad masses."
    He repeatedly told me: "If we have made some achievements in grain protection, it is mainly not my own credit; if there is no leadership from the Party and the government and the help of the masses, what can I do alone!" Then, he began to tell me why he loves grain storage work. He said: "Grain is the 'treasure of treasures.' Without grain, what can the country's construction and people's lives rely on! Wasting a little grain is a crime against the country. The peasant brothers farm the land, getting up early and going to bed late, harvest the grain, and sell it to the state to support industrial construction. If we spoil the grain, how can we be worthy of the peasant brothers! Thinking back to the old society, I lived by doing odd jobs for the landlord, often eating thin porridge and soup, and every grain of rice was precious. Now, when I see grain scattered on the ground, I feel heartache and want to pick it up immediately. This has become a habit. I often think: As long as the grain is safe, what does it matter if I work harder! The country has entrusted such valuable property to us for safekeeping. How glorious and important is our duty!" Finally, he said excitedly: "After I go back this time, I will definitely spread what I have learned to the comrades in the county who are engaged in grain storage work, so that more 'four-free granaries' will appear in our county in the future!"

    保管粮食的模范李占熬
    李白超
    几个月以前，山东省粮食厅的同志就告诉我关于安邱县第十三区粮库高家营分仓，在保管粮食方面做出的突出成绩。这个粮库的十四处五十四间仓房，分布在三个村庄，为国家保管一百二十万斤的粮食。这些仓房都是破旧的公房和一部分租借的简陋民房，连一个完整的院子都没有。然而，由于保管员的努力，这个粮库四年多来，从未发生过粮食霉烂、变质、被盗和失火事故；在一九五四年还出现了无虫粮仓二十四间，基本无虫粮仓十九间，无鼠、无雀粮仓四十五间。高家营分仓一九五四年比山东其他粮库还减少粮食储耗一千斤，节约保管费一千五百元。这个粮库的保管员就是李占熬同志。
    今年六月中旬，山东省召开第一届保粮模范代表大会，李占熬是昌潍专区的一等保粮模范，出席了这次会议，并被选为全省的一等保粮模范。趁这个机会，我访问了这位模范保管员，请他谈谈他是怎样创造无虫、无鼠雀、无霉、无事故的“四无粮仓”的。
    “我负责的这个分仓所以能变成‘四无粮仓’，主要是因为我认真地学习和运用了余杭县的先进保粮经验。”李占熬接着说：“开始的时候，我的思想也不通，认为粮食是自然生虫的东西，怎能叫它无虫呢？听了县粮食局长的报告（局长是亲眼看到余杭粮仓无虫的），又仔细地学习了余杭县无虫粮仓的经验，我醒悟过来了，觉得做到‘无虫’是完全可能的。回仓后，我便按照余杭县的经验行动起来了。在粮食入库前，彻底做好清洁卫生工作，消灭潜伏害虫；严格掌握入库粮食的质量，做好隔离储存。入库结束后，立即进行粮食的普查分类，根据不同的虫害情况，采取不同的办法进行处理；贯彻经常的清洁卫生制度，防止虫害感染。结果，虫子真的绝迹了。”
    别人告诉我：李占熬虽然已经是四十四岁的人了，但他为了使粮食无虫，工作起来却跟青年小伙子一样，经常天不明就起来打扫仓院，常同工人们一起爬到梁头上打扫仓顶，剔除虫巢。至于打扫仓房、粉刷墙壁、嵌缝泥墙、曝晒工具、处理垃圾、铺垫仓底等工作，他也同工人们一起干。
    去年夏天，李占熬分仓入库的三十三万斤麦子，虫害严重，又值阴雨连绵，没有其他办法处理，他就利用高温来杀虫。把仓房密闭起来，用火炉生火加温，仓内墙、麻袋都热得烫人，而他却穿着单褂单裤，进进出出，给炉子添炭，检查粮温。睡不好，吃不下，火烤，露宿，他就这样继续了二十七个昼夜。他的两眼红肿了，耳朵也聋了，但看到虫子都死了，麦子安全了，他的脸上露出了微笑。
    我问起他是怎样做到粮仓无鼠的。
    “关于这个，上级已经帮助我总结了三条经验：防得严，捉得勤，发动群众捕鼠。”他说，“我先把粮仓的门、窗、鼠洞堵严，不让老鼠钻进来，再在仓内四角设置铁夹和木箱自落器捕鼠，勤检查，勤换饵。在倒仓或腾空仓房时，将仓房门、窗堵严，进行围剿。这样过了一个时期，鼠害便消除了。但是，邻居有鼠，鼠还是有机会钻进仓房来的。于是我就发动邻居捕鼠。我们的房东是个六十多岁的老太太，我去动员她捕鼠时，她这样说：‘要饭要不穷，老鼠盗不穷。’我说：‘如果你把二升花生放在外面，你看老鼠能盗完不！’她没等我讲完，就抢着说：‘那年我把二十斤花生放在墙角里，不知什么时候就被老鼠盗完了！’我说：‘是啊！一石粮食，你吃八斗，鼠盗二斗；不过过去你没觉察到。况且老鼠盘过的粮食吃了又容易生病。’她惊讶地说：‘这样看来老鼠的害处真大哩！’‘那你就捕吧！’她为难地说：‘俺没老鼠夹子，又不会使用！’我就借给她铁夹子，又帮她支好。第二天就捉住一个老鼠，她很高兴。我就把使用夹子的办法教给她，她自己也打了一个老鼠。从这以后她就积极地捕起鼠来。其他邻居也纷纷起来捕鼠。就这样，邻家的老鼠便逐渐被肃清了。”
    在防止粮食霉烂方面，李占熬是这样做的：除在粮食入库时动员群众把粮食晒干扬净外，在粮食入库前，仓底铺沙，仓内壁下部加设灌上沙子的附墙；再用麦糠铺垫仓底，在仓内四周围上草苫；最后再进行一次普遍检查，特别注意上漏下潮的地方。粮食入库后，平时抓紧时间检查，十天内一定对所有仓房进行一次彻底检查；每逢刮风下雨，也及时检查；对高水分的粮食及时曝晒。这样就能防止粮食霉烂。
    “你是怎样做到无事故的呢？”我继续问。
    “除得到当地公安部门帮助外，主要是依靠群众。乡村工作人员经常对群众进行保护国家粮食的教育，粮库也常开会表扬一些护粮有成绩的人。我同群众建立了密切的联系。农忙时，看到谁家人手弱，我就去帮助他。粮库有了需要雇人修建仓房等工作，我尽先让困难户去做，帮助他们克服生活困难。房东李光云家四口人，误吃信石中了毒，王进才的孩子铡草不慎，铡去半截手指，我都跑去请医生来给他们治疗。我还尽可能帮助互助组、农业社做些事情。群众对我都很好。他们都把保护国家粮食安全看成是自己的光荣职责。三个储粮村，都建立了四邻群众护粮小组和工人护粮队。他们经常自觉地监视坏分子，夜间站岗、巡逻，每逢节日或放映电影时更特别注意警戒。一九五四年七、八月间，两次晒粮遇雨，我们都是在广大群众的帮助下，保住了粮食的安全。”
    他再三地向我说：“如果说保粮有点成绩，那主要不是我一个人的功绩；假使没有党和政府的领导和群众的帮助，我一个人能管啥用！”接着，他便向我叙述了他为什么热爱粮食保管工作，他说：“粮食是‘宝中之宝’，没有粮食，国家建设和人民生活靠啥呢！浪费一点粮食，都是对国家的犯罪。农民弟兄们种田，起早睡晚，收了粮食，卖给国家，支援工业建设，我们要是把粮食保管坏了，能对得起农民弟兄吗！想起在旧社会里，我靠给地主打短工过活，经常吃稀喝汤，一粒粮食都是珍贵的。现在看到粮食撒在地上，就心痛，就想马上拾起来，这已经成习惯了。我常想：只要能使粮食安全，自己辛苦点算个啥！国家把这么宝贵的财产交给我们保管，我们的职责是多么光荣、重大！”最后，他兴奋地说：“这次回去以后，我一定把自己学到的东西传播给全县做粮食保管工作的同志们，让我县今后出现更多的‘四无粮仓’！”
