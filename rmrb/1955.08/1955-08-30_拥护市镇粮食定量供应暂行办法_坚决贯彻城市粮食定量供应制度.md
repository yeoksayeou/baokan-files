As of November 1953, Xi'an City implemented a planned grain supply system, stipulating that ordinary residents should have "fixed rations per household, purchasing grain with certificates," and that organizations and groups should purchase grain according to plans. This quickly eliminated speculative purchasing, hoarding, and smuggling on the grain market, reasonably regulated and supplied grain to all sectors, and stabilized the grain market. In August 1954, based on the experience of the initial planned grain supply work, the "four fixes" supply method of "fixed household, fixed quantity, fixed time, fixed point" was implemented, specifically defining the amount of grain purchased by each household, the grain store, and the time. This allowed the planned supply work to get on track, and the per capita consumption quota of residents in the city decreased significantly. In March of this year, grain-saving inspections and publicity education were carried out throughout the city, exposing and criticizing the fraudulent reporting, hoarding, profiteering, and wasting of grain by some organizations, groups, enterprises, and residents. This further reduced urban grain sales, allowing the growth rate of grain sales in the city in 1954 to maintain a reasonable proportion to the population growth rate. For example, the population increased by 12.1 percent compared to 1953, while grain sales only increased by 6.1 percent. This is the result of our work on the grain front for more than a year.

However, there are still many problems in the current grain unified sales work in Xi'an City.

First, the phenomenon of duplicate grain supply is quite serious. The grain for the mobile and temporary population from rural areas and other cities was originally supplied under the unified grain purchase and sales system in rural areas and other cities, but now it is being supplied again in this city, which often disrupts the city's grain supply plan. For example, if the city has a regular floating population of more than 50,000, it will need to supply more than 1.5 million jin of grain per month. Among the city's residents, the phenomenon of duplicate supply of double rations between various catering units and cooked food industries, and between family meals and collective meals, is also quite common. Second, the rationed grain supply for residents is too high. In particular, in units such as government agencies, organizations, factories, schools, construction sites, and hospitals, the phenomenon of falsely reporting the number of people and purchasing more grain is quite common. Ordinary residents and collective catering managers generally have the idea of "allowing for a wider margin of error." For example, the Xi'an Automobile Repair Factory in Shaanxi Province falsely reported more than 40 people each month in May, June, and July this year, purchasing more than 1,300 jin of grain. In the Xihu registration section of Dongmutou City, Beilin District, there are a total of 374 resident households, of which 48 households falsely reported their population and purchased more grain; 41 households continued to purchase grain because they did not promptly declare that their population had been away for a long time. Third, the supply of grain for industrial and commercial industries and feed for livestock also has the phenomenon of being too lenient and wasteful.

The reason why there are these loopholes in the grain unified sales work in Xi'an City is mainly that the current grain planned supply method of "fixed rations per household" is not perfect, so that the grain supply cannot be reasonably distributed according to the different labor and different ages of urban residents, and at the same time, it cannot eliminate the phenomenon of the urban floating population and some fixed population eating double rations. Secondly, our grain supply department's operation and management are lax, and the supervision and inspection of the grain consumption and use of all parties is insufficient; the review of grain use plans is insufficient, and whatever amount is requested is given; the grain department does not have a good understanding of how many people there are, how much grain is actually needed, and whether there is any waste of grain. Furthermore, our ideological education for urban people on cherishing grain and saving grain is also very insufficient. These are the reasons for excessive grain sales and waste. If this situation is not improved by taking effective measures, the city's grain sales will exceed the state's stipulated target, which will be very unfavorable to national construction, agricultural production, and the consolidation of urban-rural relations and the worker-peasant alliance.

Therefore, we must take practical and effective measures to plug all loopholes, and we must change the current supply method of "fixed rations per household" to a supply method based on "fixed rations per person" of "graded rations per person, fixed quantity per grade, issuing certificates per household, and purchasing grain with certificates." At the same time, for the mobile population coming to the city from other places, the temporary population residing in the city, and collective catering and cooked food industries, we will implement the method of purchasing grain with grain coupons or other methods for management. Only by implementing this scientific and strict supply method can we ensure that no matter who or where they go, they can only eat the share of grain allocated to them by the state, and eliminate the phenomenon of eating double rations. Ensure that the city's grain sales target is not exceeded. If the method of eating staple foods based on grain in the catering industry, such as steamed buns and rice, is implemented by using grain coupons, the city can reduce the amount of grain repeatedly supplied by about 1.12 million jin per month in this regard. Only in this way can the state grain department more accurately grasp the urban population and the amount of grain needed, and carry out the rational regulation and distribution of grain; and can effectively save grain for the state. At the same time, since the amount of grain used by each person each month is stipulated, it can promote residents to plan their lives more methodically.

In order to implement the urban grain rationing system, we have currently organized nearly 3,000 staff members to conduct work such as verifying the population, assessing the grain rationing grades of residents, and filling out grain purchase certificates to ensure that the grain-per-person rationing method is successfully implemented in Xi'an City.

    拥护市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法
　　坚决贯彻城市粮食定量供应制度
　　西安市粮食局长　赵全璧
    西安市自一九五三年十一月开始实行粮食计划供应，规定一般居民“以户定量，凭证购粮”，机关、团体单位凭计划购粮，迅速地消灭了粮食市场上的投机套购、囤积和走私外流现象，合理地调剂和供应了各方面对粮食的需要，稳定了粮食市场。一九五四年八月根据初期粮食计划供应工作的经验，实行了“定户、定量、定时、定点”的四定供应办法，把每户居民购粮的数量、粮店和时间加以具体规定，从而使计划供应工作开始走上轨道，全市居民消费定额显著下降。今年三月在全市范围内进行了粮食节约检查和宣传教育，揭发、批判了一些机关、团体、企业单位和居民中的谎报冒购、囤积捣卖、糟蹋浪费粮食的行为，进一步压缩了城市粮食销量，使本市一九五四年度粮食销售量的增长速度同人口的增长速度保持合理的比例。如人口比一九五三年度增长百分之十二点一，而粮食销售量只增长百分之六点一。这是我们一年多以来在粮食战线上进行工作的结果。
    但是，目前西安市粮食统销工作中还有不少的问题。
    首先，粮食的重复供应现象相当严重。来自农村和其他城市的流动人口和临时人口，他们的粮食本来在农村和其他城市粮食统购统销中都已经供应了，现在又要本市重复供应，因而常常打乱本市粮食供应的计划。如以全市经常有流动人口五万多人计算，每月就要多供应一百五十多万斤粮食；在城市人民中各伙食单位和熟食业之间，家庭伙食和集体伙食之间，重复供应双份粮的现象也相当普遍。其次，居民粮食供应定量偏高。特别是机关、团体、工厂、学校、工地、医院等单位中，虚报人数、多购粮食的现象相当普遍。一般居民和集体伙食管理人员，普遍有“宽打备用”思想。如陕西省西安汽车修配厂，今年五、六、七月份，每月都谎报人口四十多人，多购粮食一千三百多斤。碑林区东木头市西户籍段共有居民三百七十四户，其中谎报人口、多购粮食者就有四十八户；人口长期外出未及时声明而继续购粮者就有四十一户。再次，工商行业用粮和牲畜饲料用粮的供应，也有偏宽浪费的现象。
    西安市粮食统销工作中之所以有这些漏洞，主要是现行的“以户定量”的粮食计划供应办法不完备，使粮食的供应不能按照城市居民不同劳动和不同年龄进行合理分配，同时也不能消灭城市流动人口和部分固定人口吃双份粮的现象。其次是我们粮食供应部门的经营管理松弛，对各方面的粮食消费使用情况监督检查不够；对用粮计划的审核不够，要多少给多少；究竟有多少人口，实际需要多少粮食，有无浪费粮食情况，粮食部门没有很好了解掌握。再就是我们对城市人民进行爱惜粮食和节约粮食的思想教育也很不够。这些都是造成粮食超销和浪费的原因。这种情况如果不采取有效措施加以改善，将会使城市粮食销售量突破国家规定指标，这对国家建设，对农业生产，以及对城乡关系和工农联盟的巩固，都是十分不利的。
    因此，我们必须采取切实有效的措施，堵塞一切漏洞，必须将现行的“以户定量”的供应办法，改为“以人定量”为基础的“按人分等、按等定量、按户发证、凭证购粮”的供应办法。同时对外地过往本市的流动人口和暂居本市的临时人口，以及集体伙食和熟食业等，实行凭粮票购粮或其他办法加以管理。只有实行这一科学、严格的供应办法，才能使不论何人、走到何处，只能吃到国家分配给他的一份粮食，消灭吃双份粮的现象。保证城市粮食销售指标不被突破。如果对饮食业中的以粮食为主的主食品如馍馍、米饭等实行凭粮票食用办法以后，全市每月就可在这方面减少重复供应的粮食约一百一十二万多斤。只有这样才能使国家粮食部门更确实地掌握城市人口和需用粮数，进行粮食的合理调剂和分配；才能有效地为国家节约粮食。同时，由于每人每月的用粮都有了规定，就能促使居民更有计划地安排自己的生活。
    为贯彻城市粮食定量供应制度，目前我们组织了将近三千名工作人员，进行查实人口、评定居民粮食定量等别，填发购粮证等工作，保证粮食以人定量供应办法在西安市得到顺利的贯彻实施。
