    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 31st. According to a Belgrade dispatch from the Yugoslav News Agency: Representatives of the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Commercial Representative of the Soviet Embassy in Belgrade signed and exchanged a supplementary list of commodities to the trade agreement in Belgrade on the 30th. The supplementary list of commodities increases the total value of trade between the two sides within 1955, as stipulated in the Soviet-Yugoslav trade agreement signed at the beginning of this year, by 60 percent. The exchange of the supplementary commodity list is because the Soviet-Yugoslav trade agreement signed this year has been implemented very satisfactorily and has already shown that there are opportunities to further expand trade between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.

    苏联和南斯拉夫签订贸易协定补充商品单
    新华社布拉格三十一日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社贝尔格莱德消息：南斯拉夫外交部代表和苏联驻贝尔格莱德大使馆商务代表三十日在贝尔格莱德签署并交换了一份贸易协定补充商品单。补充商品单把今年年初签订的苏南贸易协定所规定的一九五五年内双方贸易总值增加百分之六十。交换补充商品单是因为今年签订的苏南贸易协定执行得十分令人满意，并且已经显示出有进一步扩大苏南两国贸易的机会。
