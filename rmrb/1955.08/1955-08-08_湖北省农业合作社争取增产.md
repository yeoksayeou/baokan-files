    Hubei Province's more than 14,000 agricultural production cooperatives are universally launching a campaign to strive for increased autumn production.
    Since July, agricultural production cooperatives in various regions have strengthened the late-stage cultivation of autumn crops. In the Jianghan Plain and Echeng County in eastern Hubei Province, members of more than 2,000 agricultural production cooperatives carefully inspected the growth of crops in each field and took measures to address the problems they found. Many members of the 294 agricultural production cooperatives in Echeng County originally believed that after the busy farming season, the fields were fertile, and the seedlings were strong, so there would be no problem with increased production this year. After checking each plot, they found that many rice seedlings were about to lodge (fall over), and some cotton seedlings and rice seedlings were lacking fertilizer and were weak. They immediately criticized their complacency and rescued more than 8,000 mu of rice that was about to lodge and reduce production, and applied more than 100,000 dan of various fertilizers to the rice and cotton fields that lacked fertilizer.
    In order to increase production, agricultural production cooperatives in various regions are also universally preparing to rush-plant late-autumn crops and strive for an extra harvest. More than 400 agricultural production cooperatives in four counties, including Jiangling and Yichang, are preparing to plant more than 20,000 mu of late-autumn crops, and are also striving to plant late-autumn crops on more than 2,000 mu of newly reclaimed land. According to the estimates of 54 cooperatives in Chengxi District, Jiangling County alone, simply achieving this plan could increase grain production by more than 880,000 jin. (Xinhua News Agency)

    湖北省农业合作社争取增产
    湖北省一万四千多个农业生产合作社正在普遍开展争取秋季增产运动。
    七月以来，各地农业生产合作社都加强了秋季作物的后期培育。江汉平原和鄂东地区鄂城县的两千多个农业生产合作社的社员们曾细致地检查了每一块田地农作物的生长情况，针对发现的问题采取了措施。鄂城县二百九十四个农业生产合作社的许多社员原来认为：大农忙过了，今年田肥苗壮，增产没问题了。经过逐块检查，发现许多稻秧将要倒伏，部分棉苗、稻秧缺肥瘦弱。他们当即批判了麻痹松懈情绪，抢救了八千多亩将要倒伏减产的稻谷，在缺肥的稻、棉田中追施各种肥料十万多担。
    为了增产，各地农业生产合作社还普遍准备抢种晚秋作物，争取多收一季。江陵、宜昌等四个县的四百多个农业生产合作社准备多种晚秋作物两万多亩，另开荒两千多亩也争取种上晚秋作物。仅据江陵县城西区五十四个社的估计，光是实现了这项计划就可以增产粮食八十八万多斤。　（新华社）
