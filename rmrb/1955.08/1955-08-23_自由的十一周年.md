　　The Romanian people shed blood for centuries for freedom, bread, and culture; our dramatic history is written with the pen of wisdom and the blood of warriors. In August 1944, we finally gained freedom. This was eleven years ago.

　　I have no intention of quoting statistics, I just want to look back at the dark side of the past, to recall the great shortcomings in the lives of our people, those nightmare-like days of ignorance. On one street in my hometown, there were more than a hundred illiterate people. But I don't need to look for this kind of defect in my neighbors, just look at my own family before August 1944. At that time, eight people in my family were illiterate. The first was my mother, followed by my brothers, sisters-in-law, and nephews.

　　After the people's regime created a favorable environment for studying, the suffering of this illiteracy began to disappear. Today, I want to talk about the experience of an illiterate man named George.

　　In the past, when he had to deal with the mayor or a court notary, he was always the last one. People said to him: "Stand with the 'philosophers' over there!"

　　"Philosophers" was the name the officials used to ridicule those who were illiterate. The mayor, notaries, and gendarmes mocked them at will, and sometimes asked them to open their wallets. Being constantly humiliated was George's experience.

　　When the new era arrived, George was no longer a young man. Night schools were opened in the village for people like him, and all the illiterate people were invited to participate in this large literacy class. They packed the classroom, many of them women from poor neighborhoods.

　　Today, when I look back on the work of the past few years, I can be proud of the fact that there is not a single illiterate person on the street in my childhood hometown. One cold winter after another, the elderly not only had the desire, but also went to school with enthusiasm. The old men, who had never received any other education except for their rich life experience, as well as the old women, young people, and beautiful and diligent girls, all gathered together in the evening with great interest. This is truly an amazing change.

　　Culture blossoms like flowers in all seasons; after a few years, it has been proven how great the potential that was bound under the darkness is. What kind of geniuses have emerged from the ordinary people, like flowers in the sunshine. The artists our cultural clubs now possess learned the rules of harmony from the sound of the wind on the hills and the roar of the rapids. There was no place for them to engage in art in that snobbish world.

　　These artists' participation in regional and national talent performances not only won praise, but also caused special surprise. Forgotten ancient songs have been revived from the memories of the elders through reeds and flutes, violins or dulcimers. Our ancient folk songs have never been given such importance. These songs are a treasure house full of bitter past and hope for beautiful things. Our mournful old folk tune "Doina" is being sung and spread. It has become a witness to judge the era it describes.

　　The creative power that was liberated not long ago is now dedicated to creating a new ballad that expresses our free life today. The themes of these new songs cover all cultural fields, from tractors to the bountiful pastoral scenes of collective farms.

　　In the past, it was unimaginable for farmers to listen to the radio on holidays, but in a few years, radio antennas have appeared on the roofs of our villages where swallows soar in the sky. Many villagers open the radio to listen to the weather forecast before deciding on the work plan for the next day. The superstitious old George used to think that thunder was caused by Saint Elijah's chariot passing through the sky, and believed in the spells of fortune tellers. But today he has become interested in science and technology, and finds the superstitions of the past ridiculous. Nowadays, you will always find some books in the cupboards or beams of every farmhouse in the countryside.

　　Our children are also constantly exploring the mysteries of science. The grand book of the universe is opened page by page in front of them. They will tell you about wonderful plans to use nuclear energy for interstellar travel, about geography and history, and about the stories of great scientists and explorers, as if talking about everyday things. Such prospects have never been presented to the children and youth of our country, and they have never looked forward to their future with such confidence and enthusiasm. Culture has brought new vitality to our originally desolate countryside. Without that day in August, without the day that freed the Romanian people from their shackles and made a turning point in their history, none of this would have happened. The cultural and material values ​​created by the labor of the people, as well as the wealth of nature, have gradually been taken over from the exploiting class that was destined to perish, and completely transferred to their creators.

　　Our country, long plagued by turmoil and disturbance, is today building the edifice of the future with unprecedented diligence and serious enthusiasm. We are constantly overcoming all the shortcomings and all the difficulties left over from the former plunderers.

　　How beautiful our country is today. When you see its face changing day by day in the new era of freedom, you will be overjoyed. Bread and books, two things that were so difficult to obtain in the past, are now safely placed side by side on the tables of workers and peasants. People have regarded illiteracy as a thing of the past. In just a few years, George, who used to be illiterate, has read dozens of books; he has collected many manuals on farming. When you see him at night with his curly beard against a thick book under the light, you can't help but smile knowingly. He is no longer afraid to discuss scientific issues with anyone, and the superstition of many years has been dispelled little by little like clouds in the sky.

　　...One evening, I chatted with a child of about twelve years old. Above our heads was the boundless night sky, and countless stars were shining. I couldn't help but think of the verses written by Eminescu:

　　It is so far away from the stars hanging high;
　　It takes millions of years
　　for its light to shine on us.

　　I recited these lines facing the starry sky, and then turned to the child and asked if he could understand. To my surprise, after thinking for a while, the child replied: "This is not difficult to understand. The stars in Eminescu's poem must have risen in the ancient Egyptian era, but they are so far away from the earth. How many years have humans experienced before its light shines on us. This shows how vast the space of the universe we see is.”

　　I couldn't help but hug him because of this outstanding answer. At the same time, I immediately felt a little excited and stunned: What was the fate of this child some time ago? He may have been a hired worker early on, and premature and heavy labor tormented him. I imagined him cutting wood, carrying buckets of water, shivering in the cold winter, and lying in the herd of livestock to keep warm. But this illusion soon disappeared. The child gazed mesmerizedly at the silver shimmer of the stars described by the great Eminescu. He smiled and turned to me, asking me to recite further, wanting to test his astronomical knowledge...

　　In our country, there are tens of thousands of children like this. Various schools have been opened for them. They are the future scientists, teachers, doctors, and engineers, who will take over the magnificent and arduous task of building a new world from us. They were all created on the day of August; on that day, the banner of freedom was raised high. For the ideal of the great glory of justice to be victorious, for the victory of the new era, the working class fought one after another, and gloriously shed blood and sacrificed. All the good things we have today and the infinite happiness of the future are due to the unremitting struggle of the working class.

　　Our working class is building tomorrow unyieldingly with its own hands, and is advancing side by side with other people who are building, with the Soviets, and with the heroic builders of the great and distant China. There are difficulties and obstacles ahead, and there may be temporary setbacks, but nothing can stop us from moving forward forever.

　　August 23, the turning point in our history, is the greatest festival of the Romanian people, the day when the era of complete freedom and unlimited ideals began for us.

　　Illiteracy has disappeared from my childhood village today, and all the filth left over from the old days will eventually disappear. The moving book of history has just been opened, let us continue to write it with the achievements of the builders of the new world, nothing can stop us!

### 自由的十一周年

　　自由的十一周年
　　罗马尼亚作家、国家奖金获得者　尤·卡米拉
    罗马尼亚人民为了自由、面包和文化，曾经流了好几个世纪的血；我们的富有戏剧性的历史，是用智慧的笔和勇士的血写成的。一九四四年八月，我们终于获得了自由。这已是十一年前的事了。
    我无意于引用统计数字，只想回顾一下过去的阴暗面，回想一下我国人民生活中巨大的缺憾，即那些有如恶梦般的蒙昧的日子。在我的故乡的一条街上，就曾有过一百多个文盲。但是我并不需要从我的邻居中去寻找这种缺陷，只要看看一九四四年八月以前我自己的家庭就够了。在那时候，我的家里有八个人不识字。第一个是我的母亲，其次就是我的兄弟、嫂子和侄子。
    在人民政权创造了念书的有利环境以后，这种文盲的苦难也就开始消除了。今天要来谈一谈一个名叫乔尔奇的文盲的经历。
    从前，当他有事要同市长或法院公证人打交道的时候，他总是轮到最后一个。人们对他说：“跟那边的‘哲学家’们站在一起吧！”
    “哲学家”就是官们用来嘲弄那些目不识丁的人的称呼。市长、公证人和宪兵们对他们肆意嘲弄，有时还要叫他们掏腰包。不断地受着屈辱就是乔尔奇的遭遇。
    当新时代到来的时候，乔尔奇已经不是年轻人了。在村子里为像他那样的人们开办了夜校，所有不识字的人都被请来参加这个大识字班。他们挤得满满一堂，其中许多是来自穷街僻巷的妇女。
    今天来回顾过去几年来的工作时，我可以对这样的事实感到骄傲：现在在我幼时的故乡的街道上，已经没有一个文盲了。一个寒冬又一个寒冬，上了年纪的人们也还是不仅带着愿望，而且也带着热情去上学。那些除了有着丰富生活经验从来也没有受过其他教育的老头子以外，老妇人、年轻人以及漂亮而勤劳的姑娘们，全都兴致勃勃地在晚上聚在一起。这真是一个惊人的变化。
    文化像鲜花那样四季盛开；经过了几年才证明被束缚在黑暗底下的潜能是多么的巨大。从普通老百姓中间出现了怎样的天才啊，他们有如阳光照耀下的花朵。我们的文化俱乐部现在所拥有的艺术家，从前是从山岗上的风声和激流的咆哮里学习和声的规律的。在那个势利的世界上没有他们从事艺术的份儿。
    这些艺术家们所参加的地区性的和全国性的天才表演，不仅博得了赞扬，而且引起了特别惊异。已被遗忘的古老的歌曲，从长者的记忆中通过簧管和横笛，提琴或洋琴而复活了。从来也没有对我们的古老的民歌给予这样的重视，这些歌曲是一个充满着辛酸的过去和对于美好事物的希望的宝库。我们的如泣如诉的古老的民歌曲调“多依纳”，被歌唱着，流传着。它已成了判别它们所描述的那个时代的见证人。
    获得解放不久的创造力量，现在正致力于创作一种表现我们今天自由生活的新的歌谣。这些新歌的主题包括一切文化领域，从拖拉机以至集体农庄的丰饶的田园。
    过去，农民在假日收听无线电广播的事情对于我们是不可想像的，但是，在几年之中，无线电收音机的天线已出现在我们村里的有燕子在上空翱翔的屋顶上了。许多村民，在决定下一天的劳作计划之前，先要打开收音机听一听气象的预报。迷信的老格奥尔基从前总是认为，打雷是因为圣伊利的战车在天上经过，并听信于占卜者的咒语。但今天他已对科学和技术发生了兴趣，而对过去的迷信觉得可笑了。如今，在乡村每家农舍的碗橱里或横梁上，你总会发现一些书本本。
    我们的孩子们也在不断地探求着科学的奥秘。宇宙这一部宏大的书本，一页一页地在他们面前打开。他们会告诉你关于利用核子能在星际航行的奇妙计划，告诉你关于地理和历史，关于伟大的科学家和探险家的故事，就像谈论日常的事情一样。在我国的儿童和青年面前，从来也没有展现着这样的远景，他们也从来没有以这样的信心和热情去瞻望自己的将来。文化把新的活力带给了我们的本来荒凉的乡村。如果没有那个八月的日子，没有那个使罗马尼亚人民挣脱了枷锁，并且在自己的历史上作一转折的日子，这一切是不会有的。人民的劳动所创造的文化和物质的价值，以及自然的财富，都逐渐地从那个注定要消亡的剥削阶级手里拿了过来，完全转为它们的创造者所有了。
    我们的国家，长期以来困于动乱和纷扰，今天正在以空前的勤劳和严肃的热忱建设着未来的大厦。我们不断地克服所有的缺点和所有从以往的掠夺者遗留下来的困难。
    我们的国家今天是多么的美好。当你看到它的面貌在新的自由时代里日新月异地改变的时候，你就会心花怒放。面包和书本，这两种在过去是如此难以获得的东西，今天已经安然地并排放在工人和农民们的桌子上了。人们，都已把文盲当成是过去的事情了。在短短几年内，从前曾经是文盲的乔尔奇已经读了几十本书了；他已收集了好多本关于耕作的手册。当你晚上看到他在灯光下鬈曲的胡子贴在厚厚的书本上埋头用功的神情，就禁不住要发出会心的微笑。他已经不怕同任何人讨论科学的问题了，多年来的迷信一点一点的像苍空中的乌云一样地被驱散了。
    ……有一天晚上，我同一个大约十二岁左右的孩子聊天。在我们的头上是无边的夜空，无数的星光在闪烁着。我不禁想起了艾密涅斯古所写的诗句：
    离那高悬的星星，
    是多么的遥远；
    要经过千万个年头，
    它的光芒才照射到我们的身上。
    我面对着星空背诵了这几行，然后又转向孩子，问他是否听得懂。使我惊奇的是，这个孩子在思索了一会儿之后就回答我说：“这没有什么难懂。艾密涅斯古的诗里所说的星星一定是在古埃及时代就升起来的，但它离地球是那么遥远，在它的光芒照到我们之前，人类已经经历了多少的年代。这说明我们所看到的宇宙的空间是多么的宏大。”
    我情不自禁地因为这个杰出的答复而搂住了他。同时我立即发觉自己有点激动地惊住了：若干时候以前，这个孩子的命运又是怎样的呢？他可能很早就当过雇工，过早的繁重的劳动折磨过他。我想像着他在砍伐木材、提着大桶的水，在严冬里冻得发抖，躺在牲口群里取暖。但这种幻觉很快就消失了。这个孩子着迷似地注视着伟大的艾密涅斯古所描写的星星的银色闪光。他微笑着转向我要我再往下背诵，想试试他的天文学知识……。
    在我们的国家里，有着成千成万像这样的孩子。已经为他们开办了各种各样的学校。他们是未来的科学家、教师、医生、工程师，他们将从我们手里接替建设新世界的宏伟、艰巨的任务。他们都是八月的日子所创造的；在那一天，自由的旗帜高高升起。为了使正义获得胜利的伟大光辉的理想，为了新时代的胜利，工人阶级曾经前仆后继地斗争，并且光荣地流血牺牲。我们今天的美好的一切和未来的无限幸福，都是由于工人阶级的不懈斗争而获得的。
    我国工人阶级不屈不挠地用自己的双手建设着明天，并且同其他建设中的人民、同苏维埃人，同伟大的遥远的中国的英勇建设者们并肩前进。前面是有困难和障碍的，也可能会有一时的挫折，但是什么也不能阻止我们永远前进。
    作为我国历史转折点的八月二十三日，是罗马尼亚人民最伟大的节日，是使我们有彻底自由和无限理想的时代开始的日子。
    文盲今天已从我幼时乡村中消失了，旧时遗留下来的一切垢秽也终将归于消灭。动人的历史的书本刚刚打开，让我们用新世界建设者的业绩来继续写下去，什么也阻挡不了我们的！
