Xinhua News Agency, August 19th: Fifteen Chinese students who recently returned to Beijing from the United States told our reporter about the U.S. government's obstruction of their return to China over the past few years, and pointed out that if the U.S. government stopped threatening, obstructing, and persecuting Chinese students, many Chinese students who want to return to China would apply to do so.

　　Zhang Xingling, who studied metallurgy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, first introduced the general situation of their efforts to return to China. He said, "All fifteen of us have been constantly applying to return to China for several years, and have been subjected to many unreasonable difficulties and obstacles by the U.S. authorities. It was not until April of this year that we were allowed to return."

　　Next, the returned students talked about the various unreasonable measures taken by the U.S. government to obstruct their return to China, such as forced detention, imprisonment, personal control, and summons for questioning.

　　Huang Baotong, who studied chemistry at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in the United States, said that because he dared to apply to return to China, he was imprisoned by the U.S. Immigration Bureau for 116 days in 1951. After being released, he was also required to report to the Immigration Bureau in person every week, and his activities were restricted, preventing him from leaving the New York Immigration Bureau district. Shi Luji, who studied biochemistry at Columbia University, and Du Lianyao, who studied at the University of Pennsylvania, were also detained for requesting to return to China.

　　Zhang Xingling added that in September 1951, nine students, including Liu Anhua, were escorted back to the United States from Honolulu by the U.S. authorities while on their way back to China. Many returned students mentioned that as early as 1950, the famous Chinese scientist Professor Qian Xuesen was detained by the U.S. authorities for fifteen days because he wanted to bring his luggage back to China while returning home. After his release, his movements were restricted to within a county, and he has not been allowed to return to China to this day.

　　All the returned students from the United States confirmed that after 1951, all students who had applied to return to China received a notice from the U.S. Immigration Bureau prohibiting them from leaving the country. This notice warned that if they left the U.S. border, they would be sentenced to three to five years in prison or fined $5,000, or both. They pointed out that under such threats, many Chinese students who wanted to return to China hesitated to apply for fear of persecution.

　　Tong Shiba, who studied electrical engineering at the University of Illinois, said that another way the U.S. authorities threatened Chinese students who applied to return to China was to constantly summon them for questioning. As long as there were slight discrepancies in their answers, they would be framed and sentenced for perjury. Tong Shiba said that he and other students who applied to return to China had been subjected to such summons.

　　Tong Shiba continued that the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service also unreasonably confiscated the passports of Chinese students, forcing them to apply for permanent residence or become political refugees.

　　Guan Yingqian studied chemistry at the University of Chicago. She said, "Over the years, I have written to the Immigration and Naturalization Service many times to apply to return to China, but each time the reply I received was just a form for applying to become a political refugee."

　　Xi Kezheng, who studied economics at the University of Michigan, also pointed out that the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service required Chinese students applying for passport extensions to obtain entry permits from the Taiwan Security Command, attempting to force them to go to Taiwan after graduation.

　　These returned Chinese students believe that since the Geneva Conference last year, the U.S. attitude towards Chinese students applying to return to China has changed somewhat, and it has begun to approve the return of a small number of students, but they are still subjected to many difficulties and obstacles. Shi Luji's own experience is very typical. Shi Luji said: "In April of this year, the Immigration Bureau notified me that the ban preventing me from returning to China in the past had been lifted, and stipulated that I must leave the United States within two weeks. However, it was impossible to complete the departure procedures within two weeks at that time. First of all, there was not enough time to apply for a visa. I went to the consulates of the United Kingdom, Israel, India, Canada, and other countries to apply for transit visas, and the fastest one took four weeks. It was also very difficult to book a boat ticket within two weeks. When I went to question the Immigration Bureau, the officials of the Immigration Bureau threatened me instead, saying that if I could not leave as scheduled, I would have to apply to become a political refugee. After I refused, the Immigration Bureau detained me for half a day on the charge of 'illegal residence' and released me after paying a deposit of $1,000. The Immigration Bureau also stipulated that I could only move within a radius of twenty-five miles and report to the Immigration Bureau regularly."

　　Wang Zhentong, who studied electrical engineering in Brooklyn, said that he received a notice from the Immigration Bureau on April 5 allowing him to return to China, requiring him to leave by May 14, but it was impossible to book a boat ticket to Hong Kong before May 14.

　　Qian Ning, Huang Baotong, Du Huanwen, and many other students pointed out in their conversations that it is very difficult to complete the departure procedures within the extremely short period stipulated by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. In addition to the difficulty of applying for transit visas and booking boat tickets, many people have to immediately raise a large amount of travel expenses, sell furniture, pay off debts, and pay taxes; some people's employment contracts have not expired; some people have not completed their studies and have not obtained their degrees. These are all difficult to solve in a short period of time. Jiao Ruishen, who studied biochemistry in Wisconsin, gave an example: "He Binglin and his wife, who studied in Chicago, and their two children have not been able to return to China because they could not raise 2,000 yuan in back taxes and 700 yuan per person for travel expenses within the time limit."

　　They pointed out that this practice by the U.S. authorities is an attempt to detain Chinese students for a long time under the guise of giving them "freedom to return home."

　　Xi Kezheng said, "The Immigration Bureau also knows that it is difficult for students to leave the country within the limited short period, so it then sends a second and third letter, asking us to choose several paths: leave the United States immediately; otherwise, apply to become a political refugee; otherwise, give up applying to return to China and continue to live in the United States. Almost every one of us received such a letter and negotiated with the Immigration Bureau many times, even resorting to legal action or appealing to society, before being approved to postpone the completion of departure procedures."

　　Finally, the interviewed students unanimously expressed excitement about the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks currently being held in Geneva. They hope that the talks can reach an agreement, and hope that the U.S. government can stop obstructing Chinese students who want to return to China, so that more Chinese students can return to their motherland like them.

### 最近从美国回来的十五个我国留学生  诉说美国政府阻挠我留学生回国的无理行径

    最近从美国回来的十五个我国留学生
    诉说美国政府阻挠我留学生回国的无理行径
    新华社十九日讯　最近从美国回国到达北京的十五个我国留学生向本社记者叙述了几年来美国政府阻挠他们回国的经过，并且指出，如果美国政府停止对中国留学生进行威胁、阻挠和迫害，许多想回国的中国留学生都会申请回国。
    曾在美国马萨诸塞理工学院学习冶金的张兴铃首先介绍了他们争取回国的一般情况。他说：“我们十五个人都是几年来一直不断申请回国而受到美国当局许多无理的刁难和阻挠，直到今年四月才准许回国。”
    接着，归国留学生谈到几年来美国政府对申请回国的中国留学生曾采取了强迫扣留、监禁、人身管制、传讯问话等种种无理措施，阻挠他们回国。
    曾在美国布鲁克林理工学院学化学的黄葆同说，他因为敢于申请回国，曾在一九五一年被美国移民局监禁过一百十六天。在被释放以后，他还被要求每星期必须亲自向移民局报到，并且限制他的活动，不准他离开纽约移民局区。因为要求回国而遭到拘禁的还有在哥伦比亚大学研究生物化学的施履吉和在宾夕法尼亚大学学习的杜连耀。
    张兴铃补充说，在一九五一年九月，有刘安华等九名留学生在返国途中被美国当局从檀香山押回美国。许多归国留学生都谈到，甚至早在一九五○年，著名的中国科学家钱学森教授就因为他回国同时想把行李运回祖国而被美国当局拘禁了十五天，在释放以后，他的行动一直被限制在一个县的地区之内，到现在为止，也还没有准他回国。
    所有回来的留美学生都证实，在一九五一年以后，凡是曾申请回国的留学生都接到美国移民局禁止离境的通知。这个通知警告说，如果离开美国国境，就要被处三年到五年的徒刑或者五千美元的罚款，或者同时受这两种处罚。他们指出，在这样的威胁下，不少想回国的中国学生，由于不愿受到迫害而迟迟没有提出回国申请。
    在伊利诺斯大学学电机的童诗白说，美国当局对申请回国的中国留学生的另一种威胁办法，就是不断地传讯他们，只要在他们几次回答中稍有出入，就加以罗织，判处伪证罪。童诗白说，他和其他申请回国的留学生都受到过这种传讯。
    童诗白接着说，美国移民和归化局还无理没收中国留学生的护照，逼迫他们申请永久居留或者做政治难民。
    关颖谦是曾在芝加哥大学学化验的。她说，“几年来，我曾多次写信向移民和归化局申请回国，但每次得到的答复只是寄来一份申请做政治难民的表格。”
    在密执安大学学经济的席克正还指出，美国移民和归化局曾要求申请延长护照的中国留学生向台湾保安司令部领取入境证，企图逼迫他们在毕业以后到台湾去。
    这些回国的中国留学生们认为，自从去年日内瓦会议以后，美国对申请回国的我国留学生的态度有某些改变，开始批准少数留学生回国，可是他们仍然受到许多刁难和阻挠。施履吉所谈到的自己的遭遇是很典型的。施履吉说：“今年四月移民局通知我过去不准我回国的禁令已经解除了，并且限定我在两星期内离开美国。但是要在两星期内办完离境手续在当时是不可能的。首先办签证手续的时间就不够，我去过英国、以色列、印度、加拿大等国领事馆申请过境签证，最快的也要四星期。在两星期内要订到船票也很困难。当我去质问移民局时，移民局的官员反而威胁我说，我如果不能如期离境就要申请做政治难民。在我拒绝以后，移民局就以‘非法居留’的罪名把我拘留了半天，后来缴纳了一千美元的保证金才放出来。移民局还规定我以后只能在半径二十五英里的地区内活动，定期向移民局报告。”
    在布鲁克林学习电机的王振通说，他在四月五日接到移民局准许他回国的通知，要他在五月十四日前离境，可是五月十四日前根本订不到开往香港的船票。
    钱宁、黄葆同、都焕文等许多留学生在谈话中都指出：要在美国移民和归化局规定的极短时期内办好离美手续是非常困难的，除了办过境签证和订船票的困难外，有不少人要立即筹措一大笔旅费，要变卖家具，还债和纳税；有的人职业合同没有期满；有的人学业未结束，学位未取得，这些都是在短期内很难解决的。在威斯康星学习生物化学的焦瑞身就曾举出例子说：“在芝加哥学习的何炳林夫妇和他们的两个孩子就因为在限期内筹措不到二千元所得税的尾欠和每人七百元的旅费而至今未能回国。”
    他们指出：美国当局这种做法是企图在给予中国学生以“回国自由”的幌子之下，将中国学生长期扣留。
    席克正说：“移民局也明知道留学生在限定的短期内是很难离境的，于是接着就发出第二、第三封信，要我们选择几条路：马上离开美国；不然就申请做政治难民；再不然就放弃申请回国而继续在美国住下去。我们几乎每一个人都是在接到这种信后向移民局进行了多次的交涉，甚至进行法律诉讼或向社会呼吁以后才得到批准延期办妥离境手续的。”
    最后，被访问的留学生一致表示对目前在日内瓦举行的中美两国大使级会谈感到兴奋。他们希望会谈能够取得协议，希望美国政府能够停止对要求回国的中国留学生进行阻挠，以便更多的中国留学生能像他们一样回到祖国。
