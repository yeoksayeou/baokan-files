Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 20th: The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held a meeting in Beijing this afternoon to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Mr. Liao Zhongkai's death.

　　A portrait of Mr. Liao Zhongkai hung directly in the center of the rostrum of the commemorative meeting. Huge signs reading "1925" and "1955" were arranged on both sides of the portrait.

　　More than a thousand people attended the commemorative meeting in the spacious hall. Among them were members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing, members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, responsible persons of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, various democratic parties, people's organizations, and local organizations of various democratic parties in Beijing, as well as cadres of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and other government agencies, and teachers and students of the Overseas Chinese Remedial School.

　　At 3 p.m., the presidium of the commemorative meeting took their seats. On the rostrum were: Zhou Enlai, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Song Qingling, He Xiangning, Li Weihan, and Zhang Bojun, Vice Chairmen; Lin Boqu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China; Tan Pingshan, Standing Committee member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang; Liao Chengzhi, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission; Deng Yingchao, Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation; and Xing Xiping, Secretary-General of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

　　The commemorative meeting began with an opening speech by Song Qingling, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. She said:

　　Comrades! Thirty years ago today, Mr. Liao Zhongkai, a comrade-in-arms of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, sacrificed his life for the revolution. At that time, he was the Party Representative of the Chinese Kuomintang in the Huangpu Military Academy, and concurrently served as the Minister of Finance and Minister of Labor of the Guangdong Revolutionary Government. He faithfully and tirelessly implemented the three major policies of alliance with Russia, cooperation with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers after the reorganization of the Kuomintang, and vigorously supported all the program resolutions passed by the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang on the basis of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Precisely because he loved the country so sincerely and worked so hard for the revolution, the right-wing counter-revolutionary elements of the Kuomintang secretly plotted to murder him. Unfortunately, he was assassinated and sacrificed on August 20, 1925.

　　The Tongmenghui, the predecessor of the Kuomintang and the backbone of the early Kuomintang, was established in Japan fifty years ago today. At the time of the Tongmenghui's establishment, the Russian Revolution of 1905 had already entered its climax. Chinese revolutionaries, inspired by the Russian Revolution and the developing movement against the Qing Dynasty, joined the Tongmenghui one after another and returned to China to participate in revolutionary activities. The Tongmenghui became the leader of China's Xinhai Revolution. Mr. Liao Zhongkai was an active member of the Tongmenghui.

　　Although the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the autocratic Qing Dynasty, it did not truly mobilize the masses and did not thoroughly carry out the revolution. Although the Tongmenghui was renamed the Kuomintang, the party contained reactionaries and lost its revolutionary nature. Later, Mr. Sun Yat-sen saw the tide of the "May Fourth Movement," realized the power of the Russian October Revolution, and obtained the assistance of the Soviet Union, finally reorganizing the Kuomintang. Mr. Sun Yat-sen knew that the revolution must have its own armed forces. In August 1922, Lenin sent Joffe to discuss how to help us build an army, and in January 1923, the "Sun Yat-sen-Joffe Declaration" was announced. Mr. Liao Zhongkai represented Mr. Sun Yat-sen in talking with Joffe in Atami, Japan. A year later, the Chinese Kuomintang held its First National Congress in Guangzhou, establishing the revolutionary united front between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

　　Everyone recognizes that the Huangpu Military Academy, with Mr. Liao Zhongkai as its Party Representative at the time, was the cradle of revolutionary armed forces. At that time, political and educational work in the school achieved great success due to the efforts of comrades Zhou Enlai and Deng Yanda. Without their painstaking planning, it would not have been possible to train so many revolutionary fighters in such a short period of time. Huangpu students contributed to assisting the revolutionary armed forces in defeating the warlord Chen Jiongming, the running dog of imperialism, and the comprador Chen Lianbo's merchant corps. Just speaking of this point, Mr. Liao Zhongkai's contribution to the revolution is very great.

　　Today we commemorate Mr. Liao Zhongkai's revolutionary cause. We must learn from his revolutionary work. Because of his sacrifice, we should gain a valuable lesson. It is not enough for imperialists to destroy the Chinese revolution by using pressure from the outside alone. They must cultivate a counter-revolutionary force in our camp for them to use. This has been the case in the past, and it is still the case in the present and the future. Who murdered Mr. Liao Zhongkai? Of course, it was the reactionary elements within the Kuomintang. Those reactionary elements are the most vicious weapons our enemies need. It is not difficult to hear or see the enemy's bombers and machine guns. However, all kinds of secret agents, counter-revolutionary elements, and double-dealers hidden among us are very dangerous. It is not easy to distinguish them at once. However, they threaten us at all times. They are smiling tigers, the most insidious enemies, and we must remember this painful lesson. We must thoroughly eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements, beware of the enemy's secret calculations, and maintain a vigilant attitude at all times in order to ensure our revolutionary construction; only in this way can we guarantee the victory of creating a socialist country.

　　After Song Qingling's speech, everyone stood in silence and paid tribute to the portrait of Mr. Liao Zhongkai.

　　Next, Lin Boqu, representative of the Communist Party of China, spoke. (Full text on page 3) He said: Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people will firmly complete all the goals of the socialist revolution. The revolution must achieve a complete victory, and the counter-revolution must be completely eliminated. This is our best commemoration of Mr. Liao Zhongkai.

　　Tan Pingshan, representative of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, spoke. (Full text on page 3)

　　At the commemorative meeting, He Xiangning, Mr. Liao Zhongkai's wife, gave the final speech. (Full text on page 3)

　　The commemorative meeting began at 3 p.m. and ended at 4:30 p.m.

　　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会举行大会
　  纪念廖仲恺先生逝世三十周年
    据新华社二十日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会今天下午在北京举行廖仲恺先生逝世三十周年纪念大会。
    纪念大会主席台正中悬挂着廖仲恺先生的遗像。遗像的两旁排列着“一九二五”“一九五五”的巨大字标。
    在宽敞的大厅里坐着一千多名参加纪念大会的人们。他们当中有中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会在京委员，中国共产党中央委员会的委员，中国国民党革命委员会和各民主党派、各人民团体和各民主党派北京市地方组织的负责人，以及华侨事务委员会和政府其他机关的干部，还有华侨补习学校的师生们。
    下午三时，纪念大会主席团就座。在主席台上的有：中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会主席周恩来，副主席宋庆龄、何香凝、李维汉、章伯钧，中国共产党中央政治局委员林伯渠，中国国民党革命委员会中央常务委员谭平山，华侨事务委员会副主任廖承志，中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席邓颖超和中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会秘书长邢西萍。
    纪念大会开始，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席宋庆龄致开会词。她说：
    各位同志！三十年前今天，中山先生的战友廖仲恺先生为革命而牺牲了。当时他是黄埔军校中国国民党的党代表，兼任广东革命政府财政部长和劳动部长。他忠心耿耿、不分昼夜地执行了国民党改组后的联俄、联共、扶助农工三大政策，并在国共两党合作的基础上大力地拥护中国国民党第一次全国代表大会所决议的一切政纲。正因为他那样赤诚地爱国，那样为革命努力，国民党右派反革命分子要暗中谋害他。不幸他在一九二五年八月二十日被刺而牺牲了。
    五十年前今天在日本成立的同盟会，是国民党的前身，也是国民党初期的骨干。在同盟会成立的时候，俄国一九○五年革命已经进入高潮。中国革命分子被俄国革命和正在发展的反抗满清运动所鼓舞，纷纷地加入同盟会，回国来参加革命活动。同盟会成为我国辛亥革命的领导者。廖仲恺先生就是同盟会的积极会员。
    辛亥革命虽然推翻了满清专制朝廷，但没有真正动员群众，没有彻底进行革命。同盟会虽然改为国民党，但党内容纳反动派，丧失了革命的性质。后来，中山先生看见“五四运动”的浪潮，体会到俄国十月革命的力量，又获得苏联的帮助，终于改组了国民党。中山先生知道，革命一定要有自己的武装。一九二二年八月列宁派越飞来商量怎样帮助我们建军，在一九二三年一月公布了“孙文、越飞宣言”。廖仲恺先生曾代表中山先生到日本热海地方去和越飞谈话。再过一年，中国国民党在广州举行第一次全国代表大会，建立了国共两党革命统一战线。
    大家承认当时以廖仲恺先生为党代表的黄埔军校是革命武力的策源地。当时校内的政治和教育工作因为周恩来同志、邓演达同志等的努力而获得很大成就。如果没有他们苦心筹划就不可能在短短的时期内培养出许多革命战士。黄埔学生曾出力协助革命武力打垮帝国主义走狗军阀陈炯明和买办陈廉伯的商团。单讲这一点，廖仲恺先生对革命的贡献就很大。
    今天我们纪念廖仲恺先生的革命事业。我们要学习他的革命工作。因为他的牺牲，我们更应当得到一个宝贵的教训。帝国主义者要破坏中国的革命，单从外面使用压力是不够的。他们必须在我们阵营里培养一支反革命势力给他们利用。过去曾经是如此，现在和将来也还是如此。谁谋害廖仲恺先生的呢？当然是国民党内反动分子。那些反动分子就是我们敌人所最需要的恶毒武器。敌人的轰炸机和机关枪是不难听到或见到的。可是，暗藏在我们中间的各种特务、反革命分子，以及两面派人物，都是很危险的。一时不容易辨别他们。他们却时时威胁着我们。他们是笑面老虎，是最阴险的敌人，我们要记得这个沉痛的教训。必须彻底肃清一切反革命分子，提防敌人的暗算，经常保持警惕的态度，这样才能保障我们革命性的建设；这样才能保证创造社会主义国家的胜利。
    宋庆龄致词结束后，全体肃立，向廖仲恺先生的遗像致敬。
    接着，中国共产党代表林伯渠讲话。（全文见第三版）他说：在中国共产党领导之下，中国人民将坚定地完成社会主义革命的全部目标。革命一定要得到彻底的胜利，反革命一定要彻底地被消灭。这就是我们对廖仲恺先生的最好的纪念。

    纪念大会在下午三时开始，到四时半结束。
