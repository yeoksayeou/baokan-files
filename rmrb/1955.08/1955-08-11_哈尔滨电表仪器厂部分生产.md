    Partial Production at Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory
    The assembly plant, office building, and other structures of the newly built Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory, which began construction in April of this year, have already been erected and are beginning internal decoration and the installation of power lines and pipelines. The main production workshops completed last year have also largely completed equipment installation, and the tool, machine repair, heat treatment, and woodworking workshops have already been put into production ahead of schedule. Basic production workshops such as machining and stamping are actively preparing to go into production.
    The cultivation and training of production personnel at the Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory is also being stepped up. More than one hundred female electric meter assemblers have been sent to instrument factories in Shanghai, Acheng, and other places for internships. Technicians and skilled workers who have returned from studying in the Soviet Union are holding short-term training classes to train technical personnel in the manufacture of automobile instruments and kilowatt-hour meters.

    哈尔滨电表仪器厂部分生产
    新建哈尔滨电表仪器厂在今年四月开工建筑的装配厂房、办公楼等建筑物已经矗立起来，开始进行内部装修和动力线、管道等的安装工作。去年完工的主要生产厂房，设备安装工程也大部完工，已有工具、机修、热处理、木工四个车间提前投入生产。机械加工、冲压等基本生产车间正在积极准备投入生产。
    哈尔滨电表仪器厂生产人员的培养和训练工作也正在加紧进行。一百多个女电表装配工已派往上海、阿城等地的仪表工厂进行实习。从苏联学习回来的技术人员和技术工人正在举办短期训练班，训练制造汽车仪表和瓩时计的技术人材。
