To the Editor:

We want to expose the Huai River Commission's Survey and Design Institute's Soil Laboratory for defrauding funds and blindly purchasing equipment, resulting in serious stockpiling and waste of national funds.

In the fourth quarter of last year, the Soil Laboratory, on the pretext that a core drilling team had been transferred from the central government and needed funds, added more than 300,000 yuan to the 1954 geological exploration expenses (the Finance Department of the Huai River Commission approved more than 250,000 yuan). After receiving these funds, they sent people to Shanghai and Beijing to blindly purchase many unnecessary or unsuitable equipment. For example, they spent nearly 60,000 yuan to buy more than 39 tons of seamless steel pipes, which, according to the current work situation of the Soil Laboratory, could be used for nine years; they bought 10 tons of steel ingots for spare parts (worth 3,720 yuan), but only 700 jin have been used in more than half a year; they spent 2,030 yuan to buy a hand winch, but it has been left in the open air, exposed to wind and rain, and is already rusty. More seriously, fearing that the surplus funds would be frozen and turned over at the end of the year, they purchased five more drilling rigs, including three Polish-style drilling rigs worth more than 68,000 yuan. Each rig weighs four tons, and it is impossible to load and unload them without a crane when moving. Each move requires eighty or ninety workers, which is simply not suitable for drilling teams doing mobile work; in addition, two small drilling rigs were damaged in less than three months because the load capacity was too small.

The Soil Laboratory also built a three-story building with an area of 1,700 square meters, which far exceeds the actual needs. In order to set up a reception room, meeting room, and club in the building, the two directors of the laboratory instructed the financial staff to fabricate a purchase plan of more than 10,000 yuan (the Finance Department of the Huai River Commission approved 5,000 yuan), and personally went to Nanjing to purchase sofas and leather chairs. Later, the leaders of the Huai River Commission realized that they had too many houses and allocated the houses originally intended for meeting rooms and clubs to other departments as offices. As a result, the beautiful furniture they bought had nowhere to be placed, but fearing that it would be transferred, the two directors ordered the furniture to be hidden.

In addition, the Soil Laboratory also has a serious chaotic situation in equipment management with no one responsible. Mechanical equipment is taken by whoever wants it, and it is thrown around at will, resulting in considerable losses. It is understood that more than 1,400 pieces of Stilson wrenches, needle-nose pliers, black iron, glass, rubber tubes, as well as kerosene lamps and flatbed trucks, etc., have been damaged or completely turned into waste products.

The Huai River Commission's Survey and Design Institute's Soil Laboratory's behavior of wasting national funds and not cherishing state property is extremely bad and should be inspected and corrected.

### 治淮委员会土工实验室浪费国家资金

    治淮委员会土工实验室浪费国家资金编辑同志：
    我们要揭发治淮委员会勘察设计院土工实验室骗取经费，盲目采购，以致造成严重积压和浪费国家资金的情况。
    土工实验室在去年第四季度借口从中央调来了岩心钻探队，需要经费，追加了一九五四年地质勘探费三十多万元（治淮委员会财务处核准了二十五万多元）。在拿到这笔经费以后，他们就派人分别到上海、北京盲目采购了很多不必要的或不适用的器材设备。例如花了近六万元买了无缝钢管三十九吨多，按土工实验室现在的工作情况来计算可以使用九年；买了作配件用的钢锭十吨（价值三千七百二十元），半年多来只用了七百斤；用二千零三十元买了一部手绞车，却一直在露天放着，风吹雨打，已满身生锈。更严重的是，他们怕多余的经费年终冻结上缴，又增购钻机五部，其中三部波兰式的钻机价值六万八千多元，每部体重四吨，走动时没有起重机就无法装卸，每拉动一次就要八、九十个工人，根本不适合做流动性工作的钻探队使用；另外两部小钻机因为荷重力太小，使用不到三个月就损坏了。
    土工实验室还盖了一座大大超过实际需要的、面积一千七百平方公尺的三层大楼。为了在大楼里布置会客室、会议室和俱乐部，实验室的两位主任指示财务人员编造了一万多元的购制计划（淮委财务处批准了五千元），并且亲自到南京去选购沙发和皮椅等。后来，治淮委员会领导方面察觉了他们的房屋太多，把准备用作会议室、俱乐部的房屋划给其他部门作办公室了。这样他们买的漂亮家具就无处可摆了，但是又怕被调走，两位主任竟又下令把这些家具藏起来。
    此外，土工实验室在器材管理上也有着无人负责的严重混乱现象，机械器材谁要谁拿，乱扔乱丢，损失了不少。据了解，有一千四百多件千顶管子钳、起针钳、黑铁、玻璃、胶皮管以及汽灯、平板车等器材机械已经损坏或完全成了废品。
    治淮委员会勘察设计院土工实验室这种浪费国家资金，不珍惜国家财产的行为，是十分恶劣的，应当进行检查和纠正。
