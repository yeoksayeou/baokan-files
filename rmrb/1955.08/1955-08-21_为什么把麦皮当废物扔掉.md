　　Why is Wheat Bran Thrown Away as Waste? Editor,

    The Pingdiquan Administrative Region Grain Bureau Processing Factory in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has a small ditch that drains waste water. This ditch is often blocked and reeks of bad odors. Only the pigs raised by nearby residents are very interested in this ditch, and they grunt and eat in the ditch all day long.

    What exactly is in the ditch? It turns out it's the wheat bran that this processing plant throws into the waste water. There's too much wheat bran, and even with a large group of pigs eating it every day, they can't finish it all, so it blocks the ditch. To prevent the foul water from overflowing, the processing plant also frequently sends people to use iron rakes to rake the wheat bran from the ditch to the riverbank, so that the river water can continue to flow downstream. Now the dried wheat bran on the riverbank has become a small embankment. When did wheat bran start appearing in the river water? I don't know. I only remember that last winter, the processing plant carried ice blocks out of the factory and piled them into a small mountain, and half of the ice blocks were wheat bran. Only the factory director knows how much wheat bran this processing plant has thrown away.

    Wheat bran can be used as feed, for winemaking, and for making vinegar; it has many uses, and in many rural areas, there's not enough to go around. We are curious, why does the Pingdiquan Grain Bureau Processing Factory throw it away as waste?

### 为什么把麦皮当废物扔掉

　　为什么把麦皮当废物扔掉编辑同志
    内蒙古自治区平地泉行政区粮食局加工厂有条排除废水的小河沟。这条河沟经常淤塞，并且臭气冲天。只有附近居民所养的猪群对这条河沟很有兴趣，它们成天地在沟里哼着吃着。
    河沟里究竟有什么东西呢？原来是这个加工厂扔在废水里的麦皮。麦皮太多了，大群的猪天天吃还是吃不完，就把河沟淤塞了。加工厂为了怕臭水泛滥，也经常派人用铁耙把河沟当中的麦皮扒到河边，好让河水继续下流。现在河边晒干了的麦皮已经成了一道小堤。小河的水里什么时候开始有麦皮呢？我不知道。只记得去年冬天，加工厂抬出厂外的冰块堆成了一座小山，冰块当中就有一半是麦皮。这个加工厂到底扔掉了多少麦皮，只有厂长才能知道。
    麦皮可以作饲料、制酒、制醋，用处很大，在很多农村里都感到不够用。我们奇怪，平地泉粮食局加工厂为什么要把它当成废物扔掉呢？
