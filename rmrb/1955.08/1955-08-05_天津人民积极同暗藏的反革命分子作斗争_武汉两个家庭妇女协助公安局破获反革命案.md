    The people of Tianjin have shown great enthusiasm in the struggle against hidden counter-revolutionaries. According to statistics, in the first half of this year, the Tianjin Public Security organs received 284 letters from the people reporting counter-revolutionary elements.

    Gong Yuhua, a housewife who has reported several counter-revolutionary cases, recently reported Chen Yongming, a counter-revolutionary element who had been hiding for five years and had eight blood debts. Chen Yongming was a friend of Gong Yuhua's husband. After liberation, he used the alias Chen Tong and worked for the Beijing Second Construction Engineering Company for a time. This year, he went to Gong Yuhua's home three times. Gong Yuhua saw that his actions were suspicious, so she reported the suspicious points to the public security organs. Soon after, Chen Yongming asked her family for money to escape to another place. Gong Yuhua persuaded him to stay for a few more days, delaying Chen Yongming's escape time. At this time, the public security organs had investigated Chen's crimes and promptly arrested him according to law.

    Zhang Danqiu, a U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek special agent who had changed his name and infiltrated our education department and was executed in February of this year, was also arrested by the public security organs based on a tip-off from the masses. When the informant saw Zhang Danqiu in Tianjin, Zhang appeared flustered, which immediately reminded the informant of Zhang's special agent identity and activities before liberation. The informant wrote a letter to the Tianjin Public Security Bureau reporting all the information about Zhang's age and address.

    Dong Yunben, a counter-revolutionary element who was a traitor before liberation, participated in the "cleansing teams" and had blood debts, fled during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign. He used the alias Dong Lianyou, concealed his history, pretended to be active, and infiltrated the Tianjin Port Authority. In April of this year, a worker's letter to the Tianjin Public Security Bureau specifically exposed Dong's criminal face. After investigation by the public security organs, this was confirmed and the counter-revolutionary element was arrested.

    According to the reports of housewives Zhu Furuo and Li Huiwen and with their assistance, the Wuhan Public Security Bureau recently cracked the counter-revolutionary organization of the "Progressive Party Wuhan Underground Working Group".

    Zhu Furuo and Li Huiwen are both family members of revolutionary cadres. In July 1953, Wang Pei, a criminal released after labor reform, returned to the neighborhood where Zhu Furuo and Li Huiwen lived. At a residents' group meeting, Wang Pei complained a lot, expressing his dissatisfaction with the government. This aroused the attention of Zhu Furuo and Li Huiwen. They also found that Wang Pei's life was very abnormal. Sometimes he slept at home during the day and did not return home until very late at night. Wang Pei's small business of selling sesame paste could not earn much money, but his life did not seem difficult. Sometimes he even poured barrels of sesame paste into the gutter. They heard some children in the neighborhood singing a reactionary ballad. After investigation, they found that the ballad came from Wang Pei. One late night, they also found more than a dozen people gathered in Wang Pei's house, doing something secretly. They reported these suspicious circumstances to the public security organs one after another.

    Based on the reports and assistance of Zhu Furuo and Li Huiwen, the Wuhan Public Security organs, after careful investigation, discovered that this Wang Pei was the head of the so-called "Progressive Party Wuhan Underground Working Group". Before liberation, Wang Pei had consistently colluded with "Military Statistics Bureau" special agents and "Criminal Team" special agents to oppress the people. After liberation, he continued to carry out counter-revolutionary activities and was sentenced to two years in prison by the People's Government for labor reform. After this die-hard counter-revolutionary element was released from prison, he immediately colluded with Sun Jiaju, a "Central Statistics Bureau" special agent, Yu Jijun, a counter-revolutionary criminal released from prison, and more than 30 people, including reactionary puppet officers and illegal capitalists, to organize the so-called "Progressive Party Wuhan Underground Working Group". They fabricated rumors and slanders, compiled and printed reactionary leaflets and ballads, and took various measures to plan to expand their counter-revolutionary organization. This group of counter-revolutionary elements even formulated a criminal plan to go to Beijing to assassinate national leaders, and actively prepared to rob the People's Bank and assassinate People's Liberation Army soldiers. Before their evil conspiracy could be realized, the public security organs wiped them out in one fell swoop according to law. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    天津人民积极同暗藏的反革命分子作斗争
    武汉两个家庭妇女协助公安局破获反革命案
    天津市人民在同暗藏的反革命分子斗争中发挥了很高的积极性。根据统计，在今年上半年内，天津市公安机关曾连续收到了二百八十四封人民检举反革命分子的信件。
    曾检举过多起反革命案件的家庭妇女龚玉华，最近又检举了暗藏五年并有八条血债的反革命分子陈永明。陈永明是龚玉华丈夫的朋友，解放后化名陈同，一度混入北京市第二建筑工程公司工作。今年他曾三次跑到龚玉华家，龚玉华看出他的行动鬼祟，便把可疑之点报告给公安机关。不久，陈永明又向他家要钱准备逃往别处。龚玉华就劝他多住几天，拖迟了陈永明的逃跑时间。这时，公安机关已将陈犯的罪行调查清楚，及时地依法将他逮捕。
    今年二月间处决的曾改名混入我教育部门的美蒋特务张丹秋，也是在群众检举下被公安机关捕获的。检举者在天津看到张丹秋时，张犯神色慌张，这使检举者立时想起张在解放前的特务身份和特务活动，便将张犯的年龄、住址等全部情况写信报告天津市公安局。
    解放前当过汉奸、参加过清剿队并有血债的反革命分子董运本，曾在镇压反革命运动时潜逃，化名董连有，隐瞒历史，伪装积极，混入天津区港务管理局工作。一位工人在今年四月给天津市公安局的检举信中，具体揭破了董犯的罪恶面目，公安机关调查属实后就逮捕了这个反革命分子。

    武汉市公安局根据家庭妇女朱符若、李蕙文的检举并在她们的协助下，不久以前破获了“进步党武汉地下工作组”的反革命组织。
    朱符若和李蕙文都是革命干部的家属。一九五三年七月间，朱符若和李蕙文居住的里巷里回来了一个劳动改造后释放的罪犯汪培。汪培在一次居民小组会上大发牢骚，表示对政府不满。这件事引起了朱符若和李蕙文的注意。她们还发现汪培的生活很不正常，他有时白天在家里睡觉，夜晚很晚才回家。汪培作的卖芝麻糊的小生意是赚不了几个钱的，可是他的生活看来却并不困难，有时还成桶地把芝麻糊倒在阴沟里。她们听到里巷里的有些小孩子在唱一首内容反动的歌谣，经过追查，发现这首歌谣是从汪培那里传出来的。一天深夜里，她们还发现汪培家有十几个人鬼鬼祟祟地聚集在一起，不知干些什么。他们把这些可疑的情况都先后向公安机关报告了。
    在朱符若和李蕙文的检举和协助下，武汉市公安机关经过缜密地侦察后，发现这个汪培就是所谓“进步党武汉地下工作组”的首脑。解放前，汪培一贯地勾结“军统”特务和“刑事队”特务欺压人民。解放后他继续进行反革命活动，曾被人民政府判处徒刑两年，进行劳动改造。这个死心塌地的反革命分子在刑满释放后，立刻又伙同“中统”特务孙家驹、刑满释放的反革命罪犯余际钧，以及反动的伪军官、不法资本家等三十多人，组织了所谓
  “进步党武汉地下工作组”，大肆造谣诬蔑，编印反动的传单和歌谣，并采取各种办法策划扩大他们的反革命组织。这伙反革命分子甚至制定了赴北京刺杀国家领导人的罪恶计划，并且积极准备抢劫人民银行和暗杀人民解放军战士。他们的罪恶阴谋还没有来得及实现，公安机关就依法将他们一网打尽了。　（据新华社讯）
