Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, August 13th: According to TASS, the work of the biology and medicine group at the International Scientific Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy has aroused great interest among the delegates and public opinion. This group is discussing basic issues concerning new methods of treating some serious diseases by using atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

Soviet medical scientists have already completed a great deal of work in this area. They have discovered new methods of treating severe cancers and tumors, as well as various malignant and benign neoplasms, with radioactive isotopes. Soviet medical institutions are already using radioactive isotopes to diagnose certain diseases and conduct research.

On August 12th, Soviet scientist Fadeeva introduced how Soviet clinics use radioactive iodine to determine the function of the thyroid gland. Large-scale investigations have been sufficient to determine the average degree of absorption of radioactive iodine by the thyroid glands of healthy people and patients suffering from hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.

Another Soviet scientist, D. Feldman, discussed the use of radioactive isotopes to study the biochemistry of muscles.

Foreign scientists also presented some interesting reports. For example, the conference heard a report by W. Sweet of the United States on the distribution of positron-emitting isotopes for the diagnosis of skull and other fractures; a report by J. Ross of the United States on the dynamics of erythrocyte production in the body in normal and diseased states based on the analysis of radioactive indicators; a report by C. Jammet of Canada on the clinical study of thyroid and salivary gland function using radioactive iodine; a report by S. Milcu of Romania on the effect of dihydrostilbestrol on the assimilation of iodine in the thyroid gland; a report by P. Saraiya of India on the use of radioactive isotopes to treat leprosy; and other reports.

These studies by Soviet and foreign scientists show that the peaceful use of atomic energy provides unprecedented opportunities for the development of medicine, especially for the diagnosis and treatment of serious diseases.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, August 14th: According to TASS, the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy has concluded its first week of work.

During this period, six plenary sessions were held to discuss the results of research work by scientists from various countries on atomic energy and its peaceful uses, and the possibilities for further development of this research. The general attention of the conference was focused on the reports by Professors Blokhintsev and Nikolaev on the Soviet Union's first industrial atomic power station and on methods for developing atomic power engineering. A total of forty-six reports were discussed at the plenary sessions.

The various working groups of the conference began their work on August 10th and 11th. To date, these groups have heard one hundred and thirty-eight reports, including interesting reports on research and experimental work on various types of reactors and on the use of radioactive isotopes in various sectors of the national economy and in research work.

Other activities of the conference, such as lectures by well-known scientists from various countries on the issues discussed at the conference, and exhibitions held by the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and other countries, have helped to inform participants and the public about the achievements of various countries in research work and the peaceful use of atomic energy.

Scientists from various countries have established personal contacts at the conference. Delegations from the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and other countries have visited each other.

Newspaper reports indicate that a large number of scientists, including Soviet scientists, have received invitations from the British government to visit the British atomic research center at Harwell.

The Soviet exhibition was visited by approximately 20,000 people during the first week, including delegates from various countries, journalists, and the general public.

This conference has attracted the attention of the whole world. For the first time, famous scientists and engineers from many countries have gathered to discuss urgent issues of great significance, on which there had previously been little exchange of views. More than 700 journalists, photographers, cinematographers, and television reporters from around the world are covering the conference.

The newspapers pay great attention to the speeches of the Soviet delegates and publish interviews with prominent Soviet scientists and engineers. It is emphasized that the work of the conference is being carried out in a spirit of cooperation, and that scientists from various countries hope to work together to peacefully use atomic energy for the benefit of mankind and the interests of civilization.

The conference has made considerable progress. Dr. Bhabha, the chairman of the conference, said at a press conference: "This conference has been a success. In addition to the exchange of knowledge and experience, this conference has helped to remove the obstacles that still exist in the areas discussed at the conference. Not all obstacles can be removed at once. However, the new political atmosphere generated by the Geneva summit meeting of the heads of government of the four powers will eliminate the obstacles that still exist."

    在和平利用原子能国际会议生物学和医学小组会议上
    苏联和各国科学家的报告引起巨大兴趣
    新华社十四日讯  据塔斯社日内瓦十三日讯：和平利用原子能国际科学会议生物学和医学小组的工作引起与会代表们和舆论界的巨大兴趣。这个小组正在讨论通过把原子能用于和平目的来治疗一些严重疾病的新方法的基本问题。
    苏联医学家已经在这方面完成了大量的工作。他们已发现用放射性同位素治疗严重的癌症和肿瘤以及各种恶性及良性肿赘瘤等的新方法。苏联医疗机关已经在利用放射性同位素来诊断某些疾病和进行研究。
    苏联的法捷耶娃八月十二日曾介绍了苏联的诊疗所利用放射性碘来判断甲状腺的机能的情况。大规模进行的调查已经足以确定健康的人和患有甲状腺机能亢进或甲状腺机能减退的病人的甲状腺对放射性碘的平均吸收程度。
    另一位苏联科学家德·费尔德曼讨论了使用放射性同位素来研究肌肉的生物化学的问题。
    外国科学家也提出了一些有意思的报告。例如，会议听了美国的吴·斯威特关于分配放出正子的同位素来诊断头盖骨和其他骨折的研究的报告；美国的杰·罗斯关于根据放射性指示器的分析结果在正常状态和患病时的机体红血球生成的力学的报告；加拿大的克·贾米特关于用放射性碘来对甲状腺和唾腺的功能作临床研究的报告；罗马尼亚的斯·米尔库关于二氢化求偶素对碘在甲状腺中的同化作用的影响的报告；印度的普·萨赖雅关于用放射性同位素来治疗麻疯病的报告和其他报告。
    苏联和外国科学家的这些研究表明，和平使用原子能提供了史无前例的机会来发展医学，特别是对重病的诊断和治疗。
    新华社十五日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦十四日讯：和平利用原子能国际会议已经结束了第一周的工作。
    在这段时期中，共举行了六次全体会议，讨论了各国科学家在原子能及其和平利用方面进行的研究工作的结果和进一步发展这种研究的可能性。会议的一般注意集中在布洛欣泽夫和尼古拉耶夫两位教授所作的关于苏联第一个工业原子电力站和关于发展原子电力工程的方法的报告上面。在全体会议上共讨论了四十六份报告。
    会议各小组分别在八月十日和十一日开始进行工作。到目前为止，这些小组已经听取了一百三十八份报告，其中有关于各种类型的反应堆的研究和试验工作以及关于在国民经济各部门和研究工作中利用放射性同位素问题的富有兴趣的报告。
    会议的其他活动，如各国著名的科学家就会议所讨论的问题发表演讲，苏联、美国、英国、法国等国举办的展览会等，都有助于使与会者和公众了解各国在研究工作和和平利用原子能方面取得的成就。
    各国科学家在会议上建立起个人的接触。苏联、美国、英国、法国和其他国家的代表团互相进行访问。
    报纸消息表明，包括苏联科学家在内的一大批科学家已经接到英国政府的邀请，邀请他们去访问英国原子研究中心哈威尔。
    苏联展览馆在第一个星期中就约有两万人参观，其中包括各国代表、新闻记者和一般的公众。
    这个会议受到了全世界的注视。许多国家的著名科学家和工程师们第一次聚会来讨论有重大意义的迫切问题，在这以前，在这些问题上差不多是没有交换过意见的。采访会议情况的有来自世界各国的七百多名新闻记者、摄影记者、电影摄影师和电视记者。
    报纸极其注意苏联代表的发言，并且刊登了对苏联著名科学家和工程师的访问记。人们着重指出，会议的工作是在合作的精神中进行的，来自各国的科学家都希望共同努力为了人类的福利和文明的利益来和平利用原子能。
    会议已经获得了相当大的进展。会议主席巴巴博士在记者招待会上说：这个会议是成功的。除了交流知识和经验以外，这个会议还有助于消除在会议所讨论的问题的方面仍然存在的障碍。并不是所有的障碍都可以一下子就消除掉的。但是，日内瓦四国政府首脑会议产生的新的政治气氛将消除还存在的障碍。
