Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 2nd: According to Vietnam News Agency, the Unity Movement Committee of the Vietnam National United Front issued a statement in Hanoi, demanding that the South Vietnamese authorities comply with the will of all the people and sincerely submit to the supreme interests of the nation, and immediately appoint its representatives to negotiate with representatives of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in order to prepare for free general elections in Vietnam in July 1956.

The statement recounted the recent repeated assertions by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam of its sincere attitude to conduct negotiations according to the Geneva Accords to hold general elections. This attitude of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has received widespread approval and support. The joint communiqués of the Soviet-Vietnamese and Chinese-Vietnamese governments, as well as the joint statements of the Soviet-Indian and Polish-Indian governments, and the British government have all unanimously called for respect for the Geneva Accords and the holding of negotiations.

At the same time, the statement also criticized the attempts by the South Vietnamese authorities to evade holding negotiations and general elections.

The statement finally called on people of all strata at home and abroad in Vietnam to unite and resolutely demand that the South Vietnamese authorities and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam hold a consultative conference to prepare for free general elections for the unification of Vietnam.

    新华社河内二日电　据越南通讯社讯：越南民族统一战线统一运动委员会在河内发表了一项声明，要求越南南方当局遵从全体人民的意志和真诚地服从民族的最高利益，立即任命它的代表来同越南民主共和国政府的代表协商，以便为一九五六年七月在越南举行自由普选进行准备。
    声明叙述了越南民主共和国政府最近一再表示的主张根据日内瓦协议进行协商以举行普选的真诚态度。越南民主共和国政府的这种态度受到广泛的赞同和支持。苏越、中越联合公报和苏印、波印联合声明以及英国政府都曾一致要求尊重日内瓦协定，举行协商。
    同时，声明也指责了越南南方当局逃避举行协商和普选的企图。
    声明最后号召越南国内外的各阶层人民团结起来，坚决要求越南南方当局和越南民主共和国政府举行协商会议，以准备举行统一越南的自由普选。
