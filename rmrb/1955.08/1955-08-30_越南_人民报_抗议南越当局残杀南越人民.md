Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 29th. The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 28th, exposing and protesting the Ngo Dinh Diem group's barbaric actions of massacring South Vietnamese people.

The editorial said that the South Vietnamese ruling clique's acts of massacring residents and persecuting former resistance personnel are becoming increasingly frenzied. The people of Vietnam, from north to south, are extremely indignant about this.

The editorial said that since the restoration of peace, the South Vietnamese ruling clique has created many terrorist incidents. The editorial emphasized the brutal killings of female teacher Nguyen Thi Dieu in Saigon in July and the massacre of ninety-two civilians in Quang Tri province. The editorial said that an atmosphere of terror is enveloping the cities and villages of South Vietnam. People's lives are constantly threatened.

The editorial pointed out that the purpose of the South Vietnamese ruling clique in creating terrorist incidents is nothing more than to suppress the will of the Vietnamese people to demand independence and unification and to sabotage the Geneva Accords in order to maintain its fascist regime in the South.

The editorial also pointed out that a series of terrorist incidents occurring in various parts of South Vietnam, coupled with the South Vietnamese authorities' intensified military expansion, establishment of military bases, and refusal to hold consultation conferences under the instigation of the United States, have created a tense situation that threatens peace in Indochina and hinders the realization of Vietnamese unification.

The editorial called on the people of Vietnam to strengthen unity and fight to stop the bloody hands of the South Vietnamese fascists and to crush the conspiracy of American imperialism to undermine the peaceful reunification of Vietnam.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 29th. According to news from South Vietnam, the Ngo Dinh Diem group is using massacres and arrests to deal with the South Vietnamese people's legitimate desire for consultation and unification, and is carrying out frantic retaliation against former resistance personnel.

The Ngo Dinh Diem group launched a "Denounce the Communists and Eliminate the Communists Campaign" throughout South Vietnam, carrying out large-scale arrests and killings of people who participated in the resistance war and those who supported national unification. Ngo Dinh Diem's troops often deployed by company or battalion to surround small villages. Anyone who advocated the implementation of the Geneva Accords and the holding of general elections was labeled a "Communist" and arrested.

Recently, people who escaped from the southern region of Quang Tri province revealed a major massacre in which the Ngo Dinh Diem group killed ninety-two people. On July 8th, Ngo Dinh Diem's soldiers, who were propagandizing against the Geneva Accords in Huong Long commune, Huong Hoa district, Quang Tri province, suddenly rushed into A Deng village, Huong Long commune, and under the pretext of searching for resistance personnel, beat to death twenty-three men, women, and children. Subsequently, they rounded up approximately sixty residents in Tan Hiep and Tan Lap villages in Huong Long commune, and then killed them all with guns and bayonets. Ngo Dinh Diem's troops also looted the property of these villages and set fire to the houses. This terrorist operation continued until July 13th, with a total of ninety-two residents killed, including thirty-one children. Residents who escaped from these areas have filed complaints with the International Commission and the Joint Ceasefire Commission.

The Ngo Dinh Diem group frequently conducts "village cleansing" and "surprise inspections," carrying out large-scale arrests of people. On the night of August 16th, Ngo Dinh Diem's police conducted a "major surprise inspection" in Saigon and Cholon, arresting more than two thousand civilians, many of whom are still being held in prison. Many people were also forced at gunpoint to sign pre-written "proposals" opposing consultations.

　　越南“人民报”抗议南越当局残杀南越人民
    新华社河内二十九日电　越南“人民报”二十八日发表社论，揭露和抗议吴庭艳集团残杀南越人民的野蛮行动。
    社论说，南越统治集团残杀居民和迫害前抗战人员的行为越来越疯狂了。越南从北到南的人民对此无比愤慨。
    社论说，从和平恢复以来，南越统治集团已经制造了很多恐怖事件。社论着重提到了七月间在西贡发生的残杀女教员阮氏妙和在广治省发生的屠杀九十二个平民的野蛮事件。社论说，恐怖的气氛笼罩着南越的城市和乡村。人民的生活不断地受到威胁。
    社论指出，南越统治集团制造恐怖事件的目的，不外乎镇压越南人民要求独立和统一的意志和破坏日内瓦协定，以维持它在南方的法西斯制度。
    社论还指出，在南越各地所发生的一连串恐怖事件和南越当局在美国唆使下加紧扩军、建立军事基地、不肯举行协商会议等等，造成了威胁印度支那和平的紧张局势和阻碍了越南统一的实现。
    社论号召越南全国人民加强团结，为制止南越法西斯分子的血腥魔手和粉碎美帝国主义破坏越南的和平统一的阴谋而奋斗。
    新华社河内二十九日电　据从南越来的消息说，吴庭艳集团正在以屠杀和逮捕来对付南越人民要求协商和统一的正当愿望，对前抗战人员进行疯狂的报复。
    吴庭艳集团在南越各地发动了一个“控（诉）共（产党）和灭共战役”，大规模地捕杀曾经参加抗战的人和赞成祖国统一的人。吴庭艳的军队常常成连成营地出动包围一个小小的村庄。凡是主张实施日内瓦协定和进行普选的人，都被称作“共产党”逮捕起来。
    最近从广治省南部地区逃来的人揭发了吴庭艳集团杀死九十二个人的一个大惨案。七月八日，在广治省香化县香龙乡宣传“反对日内瓦协定”的吴庭艳的士兵，忽然冲进香龙乡的阿登村，以搜捕抗战人员为名打死男女老幼二十三人。接着，又在香龙乡的新协村和新立村围捕了约六十个居民，然后用枪和刺刀把他们统统杀死。吴庭艳的军队还抢光了这些村庄的财物，放火烧掉村庄里的房子。这种恐怖行动一直继续到七月十三日，共有九十二个居民被杀死，其中有三十一个儿童。这些地方逃出来的居民已向国际委员会和联合停战委员会提出控诉。
    吴庭艳集团经常“清乡”和“突击检查”，大规模地逮捕人民。八月十六日夜，吴庭艳的警察在西贡、堤岸进行了“突击大检查”，逮捕平民两千多人，其中许多人至今仍被关在监狱里。许多人还被用枪逼着在写好的反对协商的“建议书”上签名。
