On the construction site of the First Automobile Works, there are some people wearing faded military uniforms. Their healthy bodies, agile movements, and vigorous working attitudes still retain the unique marks of revolutionary soldiers. Among them, some participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, and some came from the defense front and the Korean War. They are demobilized soldiers who have been ordered to participate in industrial construction.

If judged by their war experience, they are a relatively old unit. However, in the positions of industrial construction, they are "new recruits"; and they are fighting a "tough battle" as soon as they arrive at the "battlefield" - responsible for building the four major main factory buildings - casting, forging, car body pressing, and motorcycle factories. In addition, they also share the construction of some dormitories, engineering buildings, and other construction projects. On the construction site of the First Automobile Works, from deputy manager to work section leader, foreman, from ordinary worker to technician, technician, all kinds of work, all positions, have the participation of demobilized soldiers.

It is always difficult for new recruits to fight tough battles. The first step in starting various projects is excavation. The amount of earthwork at the First Automobile Works is very large, with more than 220,000 cubic meters for the casting factory alone. The demobilized soldiers encountered unexpected difficulties in this seemingly simple first step. On the first day of groundbreaking last May, Liu Yuanzhu's team of demobilized soldiers was excavating, and it started to rain heavily. They still braved the rain to rush to dig. However, the climate in Changchun is really unpredictable. Although the rainy season has arrived, the frozen soil has not completely thawed. When they dug to a depth of ninety centimeters, they encountered a hard layer of frozen soil, which was very difficult to dig and the progress was very slow. After digging for a long time, they still did not reach half of the quota. Everyone was afraid of not completing the task, and some secretly worked overtime; some had swollen arms and broken palms because they worked for too long and used too much force; but the effect was still not great. Finally, everyone held a "Zhuge Liang meeting" and came up with a solution. First, dig a trench from one side, then take out the loose soil under the frozen soil layer along the trench, and then use a wooden rammer to break the frozen soil. In this way, a large area could be lifted at once, and the quota was quickly exceeded. Soon, this method was promoted to the entire work area.

This is only the beginning of overcoming difficulties. Such a complex project as the automobile factory requires demobilized soldiers to study their profession and master technology. Yue Yulin, Zheng Fangqing, Niu Zhongqing, and others in the steel bar team only had a junior high school education when they were first demobilized, but the work area leaders assigned them to learn to do fine and complex pattern making work. At the beginning, it took them half a day to understand a drawing. Later, it took three days to turn over a drawing, and it had to be repeatedly proofread before it could be applied. However, they did not bow their heads in the face of difficulties, but humbly learned from the technical instructors, studied hard day and night, and even thought about problems and talked to each other on the way to and from work. After such efforts, their technology has now reached the level of a fifth-grade worker, and they have personally turned over more than 300 drawings.

Demobilized soldiers treat the difficulties in their work with the heroic spirit of not fearing sacrifice in the struggle against the enemy. The cement worker Zhao Zifang team is a model team in Jilin Province and a youth commando team in work area 104. They once took the lead in breaking through the national quota, creating the highest record for concrete pouring in the entire company, promoting the development of labor emulation throughout the factory, and ensuring the completion of the national annual plan. In winter construction, the weather is cold, the mortar mixer is frozen, and it is not easy to thaw with fire. The water needs to be heated, and the sand also needs to be warmed. The mortar quickly freezes after being laid; and working at high altitudes, the wind penetrates the cotton clothes like a knife, stinging the skin. When demobilized soldier Ge Wenting was building the outer wall, all five fingers were swollen from the cold, his sweat soaked his flannel shirt, and quickly formed a layer of white frost; however, he still kept working. In order to make it easier to lay bricks, Guo Fengliang took off his gloves and wrapped his five fingers with tape to work. Under their leadership, the average number of bricks laid by each person in the team per day increased from 300 to 1,023. Demobilized soldier Ren Shouyuan is a master at burning asphalt. In order to ensure the needs of construction, he burned asphalt early and late. The toxic gas of asphalt corroded his face, peeling off several layers of skin, and blisters also appeared on his hands. The squad leader wanted to transfer someone else to replace him, but he said: "Other people are not familiar with the technology of burning oil, and replacing people will affect the supply. Besides, if other people come to burn, won't they also have their skin peeled off and blisters appear? Let me persevere alone!" He continued to work selflessly in this way.

Demobilized soldiers, who are used to a hard and simple life in the army, feel heartache when they see waste. They try their best to find out the reasons for the waste and overcome it. Demobilized soldier Huang Zhenwu is the storekeeper of the lumber warehouse. Everyone knows that lumber is an indispensable and valuable material in capital construction, but in the First Automobile Works, usable lumber that has been discarded can be seen everywhere. Some were buried underground; a large number of templates were not recovered, and it snowed heavily. Huang Zhenwu felt very distressed and anxious when he saw this situation, and he thought day and night about how to deal with these timbers. After the company issued the target of reducing project costs this year, it proposed that the utilization of old materials should reach 50%. Huang Zhenwu was extremely happy. Before the snow had melted, he organized horse-drawn carts to recycle them. The recycled lumber could not meet the needs of the project, so he organized the processing of waste materials, using waste materials to formulate standardized templates, and pulling out all the nails on the waste materials. In this way, from February to May this year, 15,444 square meters of standardized templates processed from waste materials were used, all replacing new materials, saving the country 92,644 yuan. From April to May this year, 204 cubic meters of finished materials were processed independently, saving the country 7,956 yuan. In addition, 2,030 kilograms of usable old nails were pulled out from the waste materials. These old nails were used to replace all new nails in the production of standardized templates. This item saved the country another 2,071 yuan.

This is how our soldiers are fighting in their new positions.

　　第一汽车制造厂工地上的转业战士
　　武勇
    在第一汽车制造厂工地上，活跃着一些身穿褪了色的军装的人。他们那健康的身躯、敏捷的动作和生龙活虎般的劳动姿态上，还保留革命军人所特有的标志。他们之中，有的参加过抗日战争和解放战争，有的来自国防前线和朝鲜战场。他们是奉命参加工业建设的转业军人。
    如果从战争的经历来说，他们是一支比较老的部队。但在工业建设岗位上，他们却是“新兵”；而且初到“战场”就打“硬仗”——负责建筑四大主厂房——铸工、锻工、车身压制和摩托工厂。另外，他们还分担部分宿舍、工程大楼等建筑工程。在第一汽车制造厂工地上，从副经理到工段长、工长，从普通工到技工、技术员，各个工种，各个岗位，都有转业军人参加。
    新兵打硬仗总是困难的。各种工程开工的第一步是挖土，第一汽车制造厂的土方量很大，单是铸工厂就有二十二万多立方公尺。转业军人就在这看来简单的第一步碰到了预计不到的困难。去年五月破土开工的第一天，转业军人刘元柱班正在挖土，天就下大雨了，他们仍旧冒雨抢挖。可是长春的气候真是令人难以捉摸，雨季虽然来了，冻土还没化完。当挖到九十公分厚的时候，就碰到了坚硬的冻土层，挖起来非常吃力，进度很慢，挖了半天还达不到定额的一半。大家怕完不成任务，有的就偷偷加班加点；有的因为干的时间太长，用力太猛，胳膊都震肿了，手掌也磨破了；但效果仍然不大。最后大家开了个“诸葛亮会”，想了个办法，先从一边挖一条沟，顺着沟把冻土层下边的松土掏出来，再用木夯把冻土敲碎。这样，一掀一大片，很快就超过了定额。不久，这个办法就推广到了全工区。
    这只是克服困难的开端，像汽车厂这样复杂的工程，要求转业军人必须钻研业务，掌握技术。钢筋队的岳玉林、郑芳清、牛中庆等，刚转业的时候，仅有高小文化程度，但工区领导上却分配他们去学习做精细而复杂的翻样工作。开始时，他们用半天时间还看不懂一张图纸。后来，三天才能翻一张图纸，而且还要经过反复校对才能应用。但是，他们没有在困难面前低头，虚心地向技术教员学习，不分昼夜地苦心钻研，就是上下班走在路上，也用脑子想问题，相互交谈。经过这样的努力，现在他们的技术已达到五级工的水平，亲手翻过的图纸已有三百多张。
    转业军人是以对敌斗争中不怕牺牲的英勇精神来对待工作中的困难的。水泥工赵子芳班是吉林省模范小组，一○四工区的青年突击队。他们曾带头突破了国家定额，创造了全公司浇灌混凝土的最高记录，推动了全厂劳动竞赛的开展，保证了国家年度计划的完成。在冬季施工中，天气寒冷，灰浆搅拌机上冻，用火都不易烤化，水需要加温，沙子也需要烤暖，灰浆铺上以后很快就结成了冰；而且在高空作业，风像刀子一样穿透棉衣，刺着皮肤。转业军人葛文廷在砌外墙时，五个手指都冻肿了，汗水湿透了绒衣，并且很快就结成了一层白白的冰霜；但是，他仍不停地干。郭风良为了砌砖方便，脱去了手套，用胶布把五个手指头缠起来干。在他们的带动下，全队每人每天从平均砌三百块砖提高到一千零二十三块。转业军人任手远是烧柏油的能手。他为了保证施工需要，起早睡晚地烧柏油。沥青的毒气侵蚀他的脸，脱去了好几层皮，手上也烧起了泡，班长想调换别人来替他，他说：“烧油的技术别人都很生疏，换人会影响供应，再说别人来烧，不也一样会烧破皮，烧起泡吗？还是让我一个人坚持吧！”他就这样继续忘我地劳动。
    在部队中过惯了艰苦朴素生活的转业军人，一看见浪费就心痛，他们想尽办法要追出浪费的原因，克服浪费。转业军人黄振武是木料仓库的保管员，谁都知道木料是基本建设中不可缺少的宝贵物资，但是在第一汽车制造厂里，到处都能看到被扔掉的可用木料。有的被压在地下；大批的模板没有回收，就下了大雪。黄振武看见这种情形，非常心痛着急，日夜想着如何处理这些木料。今年降低工程成本的指标下达以后，公司提出利用旧料要达到百分之五十。黄振武高兴极了，雪还没有化，他便组织马车进行回收。回收的木料不能适应工程需要，他就又组织废料加工，利用废料配制定型模板，并把废料上的钉子都拔下来。就这样，从今年二月至五月，利用废料加工的定型模板有一万五千四百四十四平方公尺，全部代替了新料使用，给国家节约了九万二千六百四十四元。从今年四月到五月，自行加工的成材有二百零四立方公尺，给国家节约了七千九百五十六元。另外，从废料上拔出的能用的旧钉子就有两千零三十公斤。在制作定型模板时，这些旧钉子全部代替了新钉子使用。这一项又给国家节约了两千零七十一元。
    我们的战士们就是这样战斗在新的岗位上。
