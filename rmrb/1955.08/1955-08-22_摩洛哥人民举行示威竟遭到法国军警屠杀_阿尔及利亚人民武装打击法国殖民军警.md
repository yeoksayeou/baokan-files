　　Xinhua News Agency, August 21st: Casablanca dispatch: On August 20th, French colonial military police launched a bloody massacre against the patriotic people of Morocco, killing hundreds of people.

　　August 20th marked the second anniversary of the exile of former Moroccan Sultan Yusuf by the French colonialists. On this day, large-scale demonstrations and general strikes were held in many parts of Morocco. In Casablanca, Morocco's largest port, Moroccan people demonstrated in the suburban working-class districts, demanding the reinstatement of former Sultan Yusuf, who supported the national independence movement. French colonial military police opened fire on the demonstrators and, led by thirty tanks, charged into the demonstration, causing many casualties. In Quaojedem, seventy-five miles southeast of Casablanca, angry protesters clashed with the military police who attacked them, resulting in a tragic incident with nearly one hundred deaths. In Rabat, the capital of Morocco, and Salé, armed French military police rushed at children and teenagers participating in the demonstrations. In Safi, Mogador, and many other places, French colonialists also massacred many Moroccan patriots.

　　In the mountainous region of Kenifra, French colonial military police killed a dozen patriots as early as the 19th. This aroused the indignation of the Berber tribes living in the mountains. That night, they sent two thousand people into the city to support their compatriots. On the morning of the 20th, the colonial authorities dispatched a large number of paratroopers, foreign legions, and motorcycle troops to attack the Moroccan residential areas in the city, causing heavy casualties. The colonial authorities also sent jet planes to fly low over the area to intimidate the people.

　　In Spanish Morocco, approximately 30,000 people held demonstrations. In the international city of Tangier, police attacked young people participating in the demonstrations.

　　As of the evening of the 20th, the situation in Morocco remained very tense. Fully armed French colonial military police patrolled and guarded the cities. American soldiers stationed at the U.S. Air Force base in Morocco were also ordered not to leave the base. A curfew was declared in major cities at night.

　　Xinhua News Agency, August 21st: Algiers dispatch: On August 20th, the People's Armed Forces of Algeria in North Africa struck French colonial military police in the Constantine Province. They attacked the police station in Philippeville and the town hall in Oued Zenati, and attacked the barracks and headquarters of the security forces in and around the city of Constantine.

　　In order to deal with the activities of the Algerian People's Armed Forces, the French Governor-General of Algeria, Soustelle, hastily flew to the city of Constantine on the 20th and convened an emergency meeting of civil and military authorities that evening.

    新华社二十一日讯　卡萨布兰卡消息：八月二十日，法国殖民军警对摩洛哥的爱国人民发动了血腥的大屠杀，有好几百人被杀害。
    八月二十日是摩洛哥前苏丹优素福被法国殖民者放逐的两周年纪念日。这一天，摩洛哥许多地方都举行了大示威和总罢市。在摩洛哥的第一个大港卡萨布兰卡，摩洛哥人民在城郊工人区举行示威，要求让支持民族独立运动的前苏丹优素福复位。法国殖民军警向示威群众开枪，并且以三十辆坦克为先导，向示威队伍冲击，造成许多人伤亡。在卡萨布兰卡东南七十五英里的奎奥杰姆，愤怒的示威者同进攻他们的军警发生冲突，酿成近一百人死亡的大惨案。在摩洛哥首都拉巴特以及萨里，武装了的法国军警向参加示威的少年儿童们冲去。在萨非、摩加多尔等许多地方，法国殖民者也屠杀了许多摩洛哥爱国者。
    在群山环绕中的肯尼弗拉，法国殖民军警在十九日就杀死了十来个爱国者。这激起了住在山里的柏伯尔部落人民的愤慨。当夜，他们派了二千人进城，去支援城里的同胞。二十日一清早，殖民当局就调来大批伞兵、外籍军团和摩托部队，向城内摩洛哥人住区进攻，造成大批伤亡。殖民当局还派喷气飞机到这个区上空低飞盘旋，恫吓人民。
    在西（班牙）属摩洛哥，有大约三万人举行了示威游行。在国际共管的丹吉尔市，警察向参加示威的青年人进攻。
    直到二十日晚上，摩洛哥形势仍然非常紧张。全副武装的法国殖民军警在各城市巡逻警戒。驻在摩洛哥美国空军基地的美国士兵也奉令不得离开基地。各大城市入夜都宣布戒严。
    新华社二十一日讯　阿尔及尔消息：北非阿尔及利亚的人民武装部队八月二十日在君士坦丁省打击了法国殖民军警。他们进攻了菲利普维勒的警察局和乌埃泽纳蒂的市政厅，并且在君士坦丁城内、城郊一带袭击保安部队的营房和司令部。
    为了对付阿尔及利亚人民武装部队的活动，法国驻阿尔及利亚总督苏斯戴尔在二十日匆忙飞到君士坦丁城去，并且在当天晚上召开了民政和军事当局的紧急会议。
