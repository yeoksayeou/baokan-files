Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: The Third Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union concluded on the 5th.

The session concluded its discussion of the report by N.A. Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, on the afternoon of the 5th, and passed a resolution.

The speakers at the afternoon session included Supreme Soviet deputies Tursinov, Generalov, and Käbin. They unanimously agreed with Bulganin's report and expressed satisfaction with the fruitful work done by the Soviet government delegation at the Geneva Conference.

Tursinov said in his speech that the success of the Geneva Conference was a success for all peace-loving people. The Geneva Conference has eased international tensions. However, at the same time, we cannot fail to see that there are still some people and some newspapers abroad who are belittling the role of the Geneva Conference and promoting the continued expansion of armaments, trying to drag the people of all countries into the "Cold War." Therefore, we must remain vigilant and be prepared at all times. This means that we workers, together with all the Soviet people, must work harder and improve our work efficiency.

Generalov, chairman of the Stalin Collective Farm in the Lukhovitsky district of the Moscow region, said that the men and women collective farmers of the Soviet Union unanimously support the Soviet government's foreign policy and its tireless concern for the protection of peace. The victories of Soviet foreign policy, like the achievements of our national economy, inspire collective farmers and all Soviet people to strive for new victories in labor.

Käbin, a representative of the Estonian Republic, pointed out in his speech that the Geneva Conference was a historic milestone in the development of relations between countries. Promoting contact between countries is of great significance to the struggle for peace. However, in many countries there are still malicious people who are constantly spreading lies about the situation in the Soviet republics, especially about the situation in the Baltic republics. Exchange of delegations can help break down such distorted information.

Next, Suslov, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Soviet of the Union of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, spoke at the meeting.

Suslov pointed out that all the speakers in the discussion believed that the Soviet government delegation had carried out great positive work at the Geneva Conference. He said that the results of the Geneva Conference proved the bankruptcy of the so-called "position of strength" policy, which had poisoned the international atmosphere for many years.

Suslov went on to point out that the Soviet people warmly hope to live in peace and friendship with the people of all countries. If all other countries continue to maintain the spirit of cooperation shown in Geneva, then the problem of maintaining peace and easing international tensions will be solved victoriously.

Finally, Suslov, on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, submitted a draft resolution on Bulganin's report to the meeting for discussion.

The meeting participants warmly welcomed the draft resolution with enthusiastic applause.

The meeting concluded its discussion of Bulganin's report.

Subsequently, to the warm welcome of the deputies and guests, N.A. Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, made a concluding speech on the discussion.

After Bulganin's speech, the chairman of the meeting, Volkov, Chairman of the Soviet of the Union of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, put the draft resolution proposed by Suslov in the name of the Foreign Affairs Committees of the two chambers to a vote, which was unanimously adopted.

The Third Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union was then declared closed.

    苏联最高苏维埃第三次会议闭幕
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃第三次会议已经在五日闭幕。
    会议在五日下午结束了对苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的报告的讨论，并且通过了一项决议。
    在下午会议上发言的有苏联最高苏维埃代表楚尔西诺夫、格涅拉洛夫、凯宾等人。他们一致赞同布尔加宁的报告，并且对苏联政府代表团在日内瓦会议上所做的有成效的工作表示满意。
    楚尔西诺夫在发言时说，日内瓦会议的成功是全体爱好和平的人民的成功。日内瓦会议使得国际紧张局势趋向缓和。但是，我们同时不能不看到，在外国仍然有些人和有些报纸在贬低日内瓦会议的作用，宣传继续扩张军备，要把各国人民卷入“冷战”。因此，我们应当保持警惕，随时戒备着。这就是说，我们工人同全体苏联人民一起，必须更加努力工作，更加提高工作效率。
    莫斯科州卢霍维奇区斯大林集体农庄主席格涅拉洛夫说，苏联男女集体农庄庄员们一致拥护苏联政府的外交政策和它对保护和平的不倦的关心。苏联外交政策上的胜利正和我们国民经济上的成就一样，鼓舞着集体农庄庄员们和全体苏联人民去争取劳动中的新的胜利。
    爱沙尼亚共和国的代表凯宾在发言中指出，日内瓦会议是各国关系发展上的一个具有历史意义的里程标。促进各国之间的接触对争取和平的斗争有着巨大的意义。但是，在许多国家中还有着心怀恶意的人，他们在不断地散布关于苏联各加盟共和国情况的谎话，特别是关于波罗的海沿岸各加盟共和国的情况的谎话。互派代表团能够有助于攻破这种歪曲的消息。
    接着，苏联最高苏维埃联盟院外交委员会主席苏斯洛夫在会上讲了话。
    苏斯洛夫指出，在讨论时所有的发言的人都认为，苏联政府代表团在日内瓦会议上进行了巨大的积极工作。他说，日内瓦会议的结果证明了所谓“实力地位”政策的破产，这种政策多年来毒化了国际的气氛。
    苏斯洛夫接着指出，苏联人民热烈希望同各国人民和平和友好地相处，今后如果其他一切国家都继续保持在日内瓦所表现的合作精神，那末，维护和平和缓和国际紧张局势的问题将胜利地获得解决。
    苏斯洛夫最后代表苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院的外交委员会把关于布尔加宁的报告的决议草案提交会议讨论。
    会议参加者热烈鼓掌欢迎这个决议草案。
    会议到此结束了对布尔加宁作的报告的讨论。
    随后，在代表和来宾们的热烈欢迎下，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁作了讨论的总结发言。
    在布尔加宁发言之后，会议主席、苏联最高苏维埃联盟院主席沃尔科夫把苏斯洛夫以两院外交委员会名义所提出的决议草案提付表决，结果获得一致通过。
    苏联最高苏维埃第三次会议到此宣告闭幕。
