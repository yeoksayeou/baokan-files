Many New Orchards Opened at the Foot of the Taihang Mountains

    Farmers in the Shijiazhuang Special District of Hebei Province are opening up orchards and cultivating various fruit trees at the foot of the Taihang Mountains. According to statistics from ten counties including Jingxing, Zanhuang, Xingtang, Jianping, and Pingshan, a total of more than 1.63 million fruit trees of various kinds such as apples, walnuts, peaches, grapes, pears, apricots, dates, and persimmons have been cultivated this year, of which apples account for more than 195,000. Because farmers have mastered techniques such as "deep planting, firm compaction, shallow exposure, and early planting" during planting, the survival rate of fruit trees generally reaches more than 90%.

    In order to develop fruit tree production in mountainous and sandy wasteland areas in a planned way, this year we are also preparing to conduct key surveys and planning on more than 200,000 mu of sandy wasteland in Shendao Beach in Zhengding, Xingtang, Pingshan, Xinle and other counties in order to open up new orchards.

    The state-owned Zhengding and Changli Fruit Tree Experimental Farms are cultivating a large number of seedlings, ready for transplanting to farmers in mountainous agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid groups this autumn. (Liang Zhaobin)

    太行山麓开辟了许多新果园
    河北省石家庄专区农民，正在太行山下开辟果园，培植各种果树。据井陉、赞皇、行唐、建屏、平山等十个县统计，今年共培植苹果、核桃、蜜桃、葡萄、梨、杏、枣、柿等各种果树一百六十三万多株，其中苹果即占十九万五千多株。由于农民在栽种时掌握了“深埋、实砸、浅露、早栽”等技术，一般果树成活率均达到百分之九十以上。
    为了有计划地发展山地和沙荒地的果树生产，今年还准备在正定、行唐、平山、新乐等县神道滩二十多万亩沙荒上，进行重点调查规划，以便新辟果园。
    国营正定及昌黎两个果树试验场，正在培育大批苗木，准备今秋供应各山地农业社及互助组农民移植。（梁兆斌）
