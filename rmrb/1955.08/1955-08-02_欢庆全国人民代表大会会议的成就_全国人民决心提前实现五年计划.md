    Celebrating the Achievements of the National People's Congress Meeting
    The Nation Determined to Fulfill the Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule
    (Our Dispatch) The broad masses of people across the country warmly celebrate the closing of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, determined to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.
    In Shanghai, Sheng Lishou, a model worker and lathe operator at the state-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, carefully calculated after hearing the news of the meeting's closing: From 1954 to 3:00 PM today (31st), he has completed two years, eleven months, and three days' worth of work in one year and seven months. He expressed his determination to intensify his efforts to realize the First Five-Year Plan at an even faster pace in the future.
    When the Second Session of the First National People's Congress victoriously closed, workers of the youth steelmaking team in the steelmaking department of the state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant fulfilled their promise to the congress. They had decided to shorten the smelting time of each furnace of steel by twelve minutes in July as a gift to the National People's Congress meeting, and this plan has now been realized. Sun Yutian, the leader of this steelmaking team, said: In the future, we must further study advanced Soviet experience, improve our technology, and produce more steel for the country to complete the resolution on the First Five-Year Plan adopted by the congress.
    Workers in Shenyang listened to the news of the closing of the Second Session of the National People's Congress with excitement. On the evening of the 30th, workers from the First Youth Group of the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory held a discussion, unanimously expressing their determination to celebrate the achievements of the congress with practical actions. They plan to produce components for six new products in August, ensuring the completion of August's production tasks three days ahead of schedule, and reduce the scrap rate by 20% compared to July. Employees in factories throughout Shenyang expressed their intention to contribute to the completion of the First Five-Year Plan. The broadcasting station of the Shenyang Wire Rod Factory has been repeatedly broadcasting the full text of the resolution on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy since 10:00 AM today. Workshops, sections, and groups have been reporting their production achievements to the broadcasting station.
    The news that the Second Session of the National People's Congress unanimously passed the resolution on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy has inspired the labor enthusiasm of over 100,000 employees in Anshan. The three automated blast furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel, built in the first two years of the First Five-Year Plan, have already produced a large amount of pig iron for the country, and the fourth automated blast furnace, which recently went into production, quickly reached normal production. Li Feng'en, a special-grade model worker in Anshan and the chief deputy technician of the blast furnace section of the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant, excitedly looked at this row of automated blast furnaces and said: The state stipulates that our factory will have six automated blast furnaces in production by 1960, at which time the plant's pig iron output will reach 2.5 million tons. This is a glorious and arduous task, and I will resolutely carry out the task assigned to me by the state and smelt more high-quality pig iron.
    At 8:30 PM on the 30th, in the cinema of the Chongqing No. 1 Steel Plant, the film suddenly stopped, and the words "The Five-Year Plan Has Been Passed" appeared on the screen. This news immediately made more than a thousand employees in the audience cheer. That evening, the factory's trade union organized a mass meeting of over a thousand people, mobilizing employees to strive for the realization of the Five-Year Plan.
    Geological workers attending the Southwest Geological Bureau's Exploration Team Leaders' Meeting held a discussion on the morning of the 31st after listening to the broadcast about the passage of the Five-Year Plan. Cui Ziming, director of the Southwest Geological Bureau, said that geological workers bear very important tasks in the Five-Year Plan. The Southwest is a region rich in minerals, and we have already discovered more and more important mineral deposits than we knew in the past. In the future, we must further develop the increase in production and practice economy, and provide more data for national construction.
    In addition to being determined to fulfill the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the people of the capital also expressed their determination to heighten revolutionary vigilance and resolutely eliminate all overt and covert counter-revolutionaries. Li Kezuo, chief engineer of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, said after learning about the passage of the First Five-Year Plan: "During this Five-Year Plan, our factory will produce 1.8 million inexpensive double-wheeled double-share plows for farmers, and also trial-produce 30,000 mowing machines, etc. However, the enemy is by no means satisfied with us doing this. The other day, when we were happily about to drive to test the newly trial-produced Stalin No. 6 combine harvester, we unexpectedly found a file stuck in the fan. It is clear that it is very dangerous to bury oneself in construction, we must keep our eyes wide open, prevent the sabotage of all hidden enemies, and thoroughly eliminate them." In the processing plant of the Beijing No. 2 Construction Engineering Company, Yang Fulin, deputy captain of the Beijing Model Group Steel Bender Zhang Baifa Youth Shock Brigade, excitedly said: "Our entire team must increase production efficiency by 30% this year and reduce the wastage rate of steel bars from the 5% required by the state to 0.3%. However, enemies at home and abroad are unwilling to see us carry out peaceful construction; they try every means to sabotage it. The National People's Congress meeting passed the Military Service Law, which is exactly what our young people want. Our team is not only builders of the motherland, but if the motherland needs us, we will definitely become defenders of the motherland."

    欢庆全国人民代表大会会议的成就
    全国人民决心提前实现五年计划
    本报讯　全国各地广大人民热烈庆贺第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议闭幕，决心提前完成第一个五年计划。
    在上海市，国营上海机床厂劳动模范、车工盛利收听到会议闭幕的消息后，仔细地计算了一下：从一九五四年到今天（三十一日）下午三点钟，已经用一年零七个月的时间完成了两年十一个月零三天的工作量。他表示今后要以更快的速度来为实现第一个五年计划加紧努力。
    当第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议胜利闭幕的时候，国营天津钢厂炼钢部青年炼钢班的工人完成了他们对大会的诺言。他们曾决定在七月份内把每炉钢的冶炼时间缩短十二分钟，作为向全国人民代表大会会议的献礼，现在这个计划已经实现了。这个炼钢班的班长孙玉田说：今后我们要进一步学习苏联先进经验，提高技术，为国家生产更多的钢来完成大会通过的关于第一个五年计划的决议。
    沈阳市的工人带着兴奋的心情收听了全国人民代表大会第二次会议闭幕的消息。三十日晚上，沈阳风动工具厂第一青年小组的工人举行了座谈，他们一致表示要以实际行动来庆祝大会的成就，计划在八月份作出六种新产品的部件，保证提前三天完成八月份的生产任务，废品率比七月降低百分之二十。沈阳市各工厂职工都表示要为完成第一个五年计划贡献力量。沈阳线材厂的广播站从今天上午十点钟开始，反复地广播了关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的决议全文。各车间、工段、小组纷纷向广播站报告他们的生产成就。
    全国人民代表大会第二次会议一致通过关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划决议的消息，鼓舞了鞍山十多万职工的劳动热情。第一个五年计划的头二年里建成的鞍钢三座自动化炼铁炉，已经为国家生产了很多的生铁，新近投入生产的第四座自动化炼铁炉也很快达到了正常生产。鞍山市特等劳动模范、鞍钢炼铁厂炉前总副技师李凤恩望着这一排自动化炼铁炉兴奋地说：国家规定我们的厂到一九六○年将有六座自动化炼铁炉投入生产，那时全厂的生铁产量将达到二百五十万吨，这是一个光荣而艰巨的任务，我一定坚决执行国家交给我的任务，炼出更多的优质生铁。
    三十日晚八时半，在重庆第一钢铁厂的电影院里，影片突然中断，银幕上出现了“五年计划通过了”几个大字。这个消息立刻使全场一千多职工欢呼起来。当晚，这个厂的工会组织召开了一千多人的群众大会，动员职工为实现五年计划而努力。
    参加西南地质局勘探队长会议的地质工作者们，在三十一日早晨收听了关于通过五年计划的广播后，举行了座谈会。西南地质局局长崔子明说，地质工作者在五年计划中担负了很重大的任务，西南是多矿地区，我们已经发现了比过去知道得更多更重要的矿藏。我们今后要进一步开展增产节约，为国家建设提供更多的资料。
    首都人民除决心提前实现第一个五年计划外，并表示要提高革命警惕，坚决肃清一切公开的和暗藏的反革命分子。北京农业机械厂总工程师李克佐知道了通过第一个五年计划的消息以后说：“我厂在这五年计划当中，要给农民生产一百八十万部廉价的双轮双铧犁，并且还要试制三万架割草机等。但是，敌人决不满意我们这样做。前些日子，当我们高高兴兴地要开车试验新试制成功的斯大林六号联合收割机的时候，竟然发现风扇里卡着一把锉刀。可见光埋头搞建设是很危险的，我们必须把眼睛擦得亮亮的，防止一切暗藏敌人的破坏，并把他们彻底肃清。”在北京市第二建筑工程公司加工厂，北京市模范小组钢筋工张百发青年突击队副队长杨福林兴奋地说：“我们全队今年一定要把生产效率提高百分之三十，把钢筋的损耗率由国家要求的百分之五降低到千分之三。可是国内外的敌人是不乐意我们进行和平建设的，他们想尽一切方法来破坏。全国人民代表大会会议通过了兵役法，这正合我们青年人的心愿，我们队不单是祖国的建设者，如果祖国一旦需要我们，我们一定去做祖国的保卫者。”
