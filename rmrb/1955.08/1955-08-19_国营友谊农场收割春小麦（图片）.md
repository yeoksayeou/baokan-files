    The spring wheat harvest at the State-run Friendship Farm has begun. Before the harvest, Soviet experts from the Fifth Branch Farm (first from the left) and farm staff are inspecting the maturity of the wheat in the fields.
    Combine harvester operators drive combine harvesters in the boundless sea of wheat.
    The highly efficient stacker quickly rolls the wheat transported by trucks to the center of the threshing ground.
    During the spring wheat harvest, some tractors are also deployed for autumn harrowing. This is a Stalin 80 tractor pulling twelve sets of disc harrows to carry out autumn harrowing and weed control on newly opened land in the spring.

    国营友谊农场春小麦的收割工作已经开始了。收割前，第五分场的苏联专家（左第一人）和农场工作人员在麦田里检查小麦成熟的情况。
    联合收割机手驾驶联合收割机在无边的麦海里工作。
    有高度传送效率的倒堆机，将汽车运来的小麦迅速卷到晒麦场的中心。
    在收割春小麦的期间，还出动了部分拖拉机进行秋耙。这是斯大林八十号拖拉机牵引十二组圆盘耙，在春季新开的土地上进行秋季耙地灭草。
