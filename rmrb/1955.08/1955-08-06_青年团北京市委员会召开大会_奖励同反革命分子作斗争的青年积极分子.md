Xinhua News Agency, August 4th. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League convened a meeting on the 4th for young activists in the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries. Over nine hundred people attended, including young activists and staff from grassroots League organizations.

    At the meeting, twenty-two young people were rewarded and commended for actively assisting public security organs in fighting against hidden counter-revolutionaries. These young people have consistently maintained a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, bravely reporting, investigating, and assisting public security organs in arresting counter-revolutionaries and criminal offenders. Wu Deyuan, a young manual laborer in the engraving industry, has helped public security departments discover and arrest many counter-revolutionaries and criminal offenders who illegally carved official seals over the past few years. On one occasion, two suspicious individuals approached him to carve an official seal but did not bring a letter of introduction. He agreed to carve the seal but immediately reported it to the police station. After investigation by the police station, it was found that one was a fugitive landlord and the other was a Kuomintang reactionary officer who wanted to forge official seals to carry out evil activities. The next evening, when these two people came to pick up the seal, they were arrested by public security personnel.

    Li Shuying, a young housewife and public security committee member of Zixin Road in Xuanwu District, along with her husband, reported Wu Yuqi, a local tyrant landlord who had fled to Beijing under an assumed name. Before liberation, Wu Yuqi had served as a puppet township chief, leading more than two hundred landlord armed men, rampaging through the countryside, raping women, and murdering revolutionary cadres.

    Zhang Jingli, a student at Peking University, reported the big swindler Zhang Ziyun, who was sentenced by the government to twelve years imprisonment according to the law.

    At the meeting, Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and Xing Xiangsheng, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, delivered speeches.

    Finally, the meeting passed a resolution, unanimously expressing their determination to resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries.

    新华社四日讯　中国新民主主义青年团北京市委员会四日召开了青年肃清反革命分子斗争积极分子大会，参加大会的有青年积极分子、团的基层组织的工作人员等九百多人。
    会上，二十二名青年因积极协助公安机关同暗藏的反革命分子斗争分别受到奖励和表扬。这些青年经常保持着高度的革命警惕性，勇敢地检举、追查，和协助公安机关逮捕反革命分子和刑事罪犯。青年刻字手工业劳动者吴德元几年来帮助公安部门发现和逮捕了许多私刻公章的反革命分子和刑事罪犯。有一次两个行迹可疑的分子来找他刻公章，却没有带介绍信，他一面答应给他们刻，一面立刻报告了派出所。经派出所查明，一个是逃亡地主，一个是国民党反动军官，想假造公章进行罪恶活动。次日晚这两个人来取公章的时候，就被公安人员逮捕了。
    青年家庭妇女李淑英，是宣武区自新路治安保卫委员，她和丈夫一起检举了化名潜逃来京的恶霸地主吴玉奇。吴玉奇在解放前曾当过伪乡长，带着二百多名地主武装，横行乡里，强奸妇女，杀害革命干部。
    北京大学学生张静丽检举了大骗匪张子云，这个罪犯被政府依法判处徒刑十二年。
    会上，中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡耀邦，北京市公安局副局长邢相生都讲了话。
    最后，大会通过了一项决议，一致表示要坚决、彻底、干净、全部地肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子。
