　　Construction Begins on the First Automobile Accessory Factory

    Construction has begun on the state-owned First Automobile Accessory Factory.

    The design of this factory was based on the design drawings of similar factories in the Soviet Union, under the guidance of Soviet experts. The entire factory has workshops for die-casting, stamping, metalworking, and new product trial production. Most of the machinery and equipment ordered from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, and domestically have already been delivered.

    Prior to the commencement of construction, the factory re-examined the technical design of the construction project that had been completed. After careful calculation, the total investment was reduced by 20 percent.

    Preparations for the First Automobile Accessory Factory began in July 1953. It will specialize in producing most of the medium and small-sized metal accessories for automobiles and tractors for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and the Tractor Manufacturing Plant.

　　第一汽车附件厂开工建设
    国营第一汽车附件厂已经动工建设。
    这个工厂的设计，是在苏联专家指导下仿照苏联同类工厂的设计图纸做成的。全厂有压铸、冲压、金工和新产品试制等车间。向苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、德意志民主共和国和自国内订购的机器设备，大部分都已经运到。
    在开工前夕，这个厂重新审查了已做好的建厂工程的技术设计，经过精打细算，总投资减少了百分之二十。
    第一汽车附件厂是在一九五三年七月开始筹建的。它将专为第一汽车制造厂、拖拉机制造厂生产制造汽车和拖拉机用的大部分中、小型金属附件。
