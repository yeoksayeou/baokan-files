    Help City Grain Consumers Calculate Three Accounts

    In March and April of this year, all cities carried out widespread publicity work on saving grain. This publicity work achieved certain results, and the idea of opposing waste of grain has greatly increased among the majority of urban residents. However, in some areas, the publicity work on saving grain had shortcomings, mainly: publicity was carried out in isolation, without being combined with organizational management work; or only general principles were talked about, without combining national interests with individual interests; or publicity was carried out sporadically and dispersedly, without forming a concentrated and huge force. The Grain Saving Exhibition recently held in Beijing has made relatively great efforts in the publicity work of saving grain, and thus played a relatively good role.

    This exhibition was held closely in conjunction with the household grain verification and supply work currently being carried out in Beijing. It gathered together the good materials from grain saving publicity work in the past period and the materials recently discovered in actual work, and used many vivid and convincing facts and statistical charts to publicize to urban residents the consistency of the interests of urban residents with the interests of farmers and with the interests of the entire country, and linked the current action of saving grain with the long-term goal of building socialism. This experience is worth promoting.

    The Beijing exhibition helped urban residents calculate three major accounts regarding the grain issue.

    The first account is about our country's grain production situation, and the consumption and sales of grain in cities (especially this city). It is necessary to explain to all urban residents: our grain is enough to eat and use, the grain supply after unified purchase and sales is indeed guaranteed, it is completely unnecessary for each household to save grain themselves, and all kinds of worries and rumors about the "tension" of the grain issue are completely unfounded. At the same time, it is necessary to explain to all urban residents: our grain is not yet abundant, if everyone wants to save, if the supply cannot be rational, if the increase in grain consumption exceeds the increase in grain production, if the phenomenon of wasting grain cannot be overcome, then the grain supply plan will be broken, the country's supply of grain will encounter difficulties, and as a result, the interests of every urban resident will be harmed. It should be told to the urban people: in 1954, the total grain output of the country reached 339 billion jin (raw grain); this number increased by about 50 percent compared with 1949; and increased by about 13 percent compared with the year with the highest output before the War of Resistance Against Japan (1936). 339 billion jin of raw grain, converted into shelled grain, is 292 billion jin, which averages more than 480 jin per person per year based on the national population. After deducting seeds, feed and other consumption, the average is more than one jin per person per day. According to the average living standard of Chinese people, this number is enough to eat. From July 1954 to June 1955, the country sold 80.9 billion jin of grain; it is estimated that about 36 billion jin were sold in rural areas, and about 44.9 billion jin were sold in cities and industrial and mining areas. Calculated on the average population of cities and industrial and mining areas (nearly 100 million) in the country, each urban resident has about 450 jin. After deducting the grain used for industry and the animal feed needed by cities, this number is also enough to eat. The problem now is that the grain consumption in cities is increasing too fast. Compared with 1954 and 1951, the grain sales in Beijing increased by 182 percent. Part of this increase is reasonable, but a considerable part of the increase is unreasonable. Compared with the first quarter of 1955 and the first quarter of 1954, the population of Beijing increased by 14 percent, but the grain sales increased by 35 percent, that is to say, 21 percent was not sold more due to the increase in population. In 1954, the country produced 5.4 billion jin (raw grain) more grain than in 1953, which is an increase of just over 1.6 percent. If everyone in the country eats half an ounce of grain more per day, it will be 7 billion jin a year, far exceeding the amount of increase in production this year. It can be seen from this that this trend of unreasonable increase must be resolutely stopped. We also need to tell urban residents: the unreasonable increase in grain sales in cities will inevitably cause opposition from farmers. From July 1953 to June 1954, the state purchased and levied a total of 86.5 billion jin of grain (shelled grain) from farmers; from July 1954 to June 1955, the total amount of grain purchased and levied from farmers was 89.3 billion jin; both are equivalent to about one-third of the total output. This proportion is not very high, but it is not very low; under the current situation, any further increase will be detrimental to increasing agricultural production. Therefore, the government has stipulated that the total amount of grain purchased and levied from July 1955 to June 1956 will be 86.5 billion jin, and it is decided that this total number will remain unchanged for three years. Since the number of grain purchased from farmers cannot be increased within a certain period of time, the number of grain sold to urban residents cannot be increased within a certain period of time; on the contrary, it is very necessary and reasonable to compress the numbers that exceed the plan in cities and the numbers that are unreasonably sold more.

    The second account is to make urban residents understand how the grain they consume is produced, and how hard agricultural labor and how complicated purchasing, transportation and other work it takes to reach their hands. This is to tell the vast number of grain consumers about the huge social labor and the huge financial and material resources paid by the state in the process of grain production and supply with vivid and specific facts, so that they can truly understand "one porridge and one meal, we should think of where it comes from is not easy," and stimulate their enthusiasm and sense of responsibility for saving grain. Urban residents should understand: the more than 40 billion jin of grain supplied to cities across the country every year requires more than 20 million full laborers to work hard on more than 300 million mu of land for a year to produce it, according to the current level of agricultural production in our country. In order to increase agricultural production, the state has used huge investments and loans in agriculture. From 1950 to 1954, the state invested more than 160 million yuan in farmland water conservancy, and agricultural loans accumulated more than 3.75 billion yuan. In 1954, the state subsidized more than 200 million yuan in freight and miscellaneous expenses in the purchase and sale of grain alone. An electric map in the Beijing Exhibition shows that the grain eaten by Beijing residents every day has to travel 1,924 li on average transport mileage, some of which is transported from more than 5,000 li away. Another exhibition chart in the exhibition calculated the following accounts for people: in 1954, the grain transferred to Beijing from other places, if it were completely transported by modern means of transportation, would require more than 30,000 train cars, or more than 230,000 trucks. These materials in the exhibition convincingly show that if urban residents do not pay attention to saving in grain consumption, they will be sorry for the farmers and the country; if the situation of wasting grain is not completely changed, it will inevitably cause serious damage to the country's socialist construction and the worker-peasant alliance.

    The third account is to calculate the benefits that urban residents have obtained since the implementation of unified purchase and sales of grain, so that everyone can consciously maintain and consolidate the achievements of unified purchase and sales. A chart in the Beijing Exhibition showing the changes in the prices of grain and several major necessities of life in Beijing in recent years since liberation shows that from 1949 to 1950, the prices of these items fluctuated sharply, and the range of increase was large and the range of decrease was small; from 1950 to the autumn of 1953, prices had been relatively stable, but there were still some fluctuations; and from the winter of 1953, the prices of grain and several other major consumer goods were completely stable. Of course, there are many reasons for price stability, but the unified purchase and sales of grain and other important materials is an extremely important reason. Each city has specific materials to illustrate this point. Before the implementation of unified grain sales, the selling price of each dan of rice in private rice shops in Shanghai was about one jiao higher than that of state-owned grain companies; after the implementation of unified grain sales, Shanghai citizens completely got rid of this exploitation and could save 80,000 yuan per month. After the implementation of unified grain sales in Guangzhou, the selling price of grain has remained stable at the price level of 1952, and the selling price of each dan of rice is 6 or 7 jiao lower than the selling price of private merchants before unified sales, so that the people of the city can avoid the exploitation of private merchants by several million yuan every year. The benefits that the policy of unified purchase and sales of grain has brought to consumers are particularly prominent in Wuhan, which has experienced two flood disasters in the past 20 years. In 1931, Wuhan suffered a flood disaster. At that time, grain prices changed several times a day, rising faster than the flood; last year, Wuhan suffered a flood that was much larger than the one in 1931, but because the state controlled the grain, the city's grain supply was sufficient, and the grain price did not change at all. Residents of Wuhan described this situation as: "From the rise of the water to the fall of the water, the grain price is as stable as Mount Tai!" When publicizing the benefits of unified grain sales to the urban people, the relationship between implementing the unified grain sales policy and saving grain should be explained clearly, so that everyone understands that in order to consolidate the achievements of unified grain sales, it is necessary to gradually implement the unified grain sales policy with a more perfect system; every consumer must firmly abide by the grain supply system and save grain as much as possible. The more consciously urban residents maintain the unified grain sales policy and abide by the grain supply system, the more reliable the grain supply in cities will be.

    Calculating these three accounts for urban residents is to let them understand the country's grain production and sales situation, understand the city's grain consumption situation, and participate in the work of saving grain with the attitude of masters; it is to make them have a clear understanding, eliminate worries, make careful calculations, and jointly manage our "family affairs." Comrade Chen Yun called on the people of the whole country at the Second Session of the National People's Congress to save half an ounce of grain per person per day on a normal consumption level, and to adhere to this savings system for a long time, and to reserve a certain amount of grain within a certain period of time to cope with possible unexpected events. We should use the above-mentioned method of calculation and other methods to widely publicize this idea to the broad masses of the people, so that everyone understands the far-reaching significance of saving grain, actively and consciously act, and make greater achievements in saving grain.

    帮城市粮食消费者算三笔账
    今年三四月间，各城市普遍进行了节约粮食的宣传工作。这次宣传工作得到了一定的成绩，在广大城市居民中间，反对浪费粮食的思想是大大增长了。但是，有些地区，节约粮食的宣传工作是有缺点的，主要的是：孤立地进行宣传，没有同组织管理工作结合起来；或者只是空谈大道理，没有把国家利益同个人利益结合起来；或者是零星、散漫地进行宣传，没有形成集中的巨大的力量。最近北京市举办的节约粮食展览会，在节约粮食的宣传工作方面作了比较大的努力，因而起了比较好的作用。
    这个展览会是密切地配合着北京市正在进行的粮食按户核实供应工作举办的。它把过去一个时期粮食节约宣传工作中的好材料和最近期间在实际工作中发现的材料集中起来，用许多生动的、有说服力的事实和统计图表，向城市居民宣传城市居民的利益同农民的利益的一致性，同整个国家的利益的一致性，把当前节约粮食的行动同建设社会主义的远大目标联系了起来。这个经验是值得推广的。
    北京市展览会帮助城市居民算了关于粮食问题的三笔大账。
    第一笔账是关于我们国家的粮食生产情况、城市（特别是本城市）粮食的消费和销售的情况。要向全体城市居民说明：我们的粮食是够吃够用的，统购统销后的粮食供应是确有保证的，各家各户自己积存粮食是完全没有必要的，各式各样关于粮食问题“紧张”的疑虑和传说都是毫无根据的。同时要向全体城市居民说明：我们的粮食现在还不宽裕，如果大家都要积存，如果供应不能合理，如果粮食消费的增加超过了粮食生产的增加，如果浪费粮食的现象不能克服，那末，粮食供应计划就会被突破，国家对粮食的供应就会碰到困难，结果，每个城市居民的利益都会遭到损害。应当告诉城市人民：一九五四年，全国的粮食总产量已经达到了三千三百九十亿斤（原粮）；这个数目比一九四九年增加了大约百分之五十；比抗日战争以前产量最高的一年（一九三六年）增加了大约百分之十三。三千三百九十亿斤原粮，折合成去壳粮是二千九百二十亿斤，按全国人口平均，每人每年合四百八十多斤。把种籽、饲料和别的消耗除去，平均每人每天合
  一斤以上。按照我国一般人的平均生活水平，这个数目是够吃的。一九五四年七月到一九五五年六月，全国销售了八百零九亿斤粮食；估计其中销在农村的约三百六十亿斤，销在城市和工矿区的约四百四十九亿斤。按全国城市和工矿区人口（将近一亿）平均计算，每个城市居民大约有四百五十多斤。把工业用粮和城市需用的牲畜饲料除去，这个数目也是够吃的。现在的问题是城市消耗的粮食增加得太快了。以一九五四年和一九五一年相比，北京市的粮食销售量增加了百分之一百八十二。其中有一部分的增加是合理的，但有相当一部分的增加是不合理的。一九五五年第一季度同一九五四年第一季度相比，北京市人口增加了百分之十四，粮食销售量却增加了百分之三十五，也就是说，有百分之二十一不是因人口增加而多销的。一九五四年全国生产的粮食比一九五三年增加了五十四亿斤（原粮），也就是增加了百分之一点六强。假如全国每人每天多吃半两粮食，一年就是七十亿斤，远远超出了这一年增产的数目。由此可见，这种不合理的增加的趋势必须坚决加以制止。我们还要告诉城市居民：城市粮食销售量不合理的增加，必然引起农民的反对。一九五三年七月到一九五四年六月，国家向农民收购和征收的粮食（去壳粮）共总有八百六十五亿斤；一九五四年七月到一九五五年六月，向农民收购和征收的粮食总数是八百九十三亿斤；都相当于总产量的三分之一左右。这个比例，不算很高，但也不算很低；在目前的情况下，再要增加，就不利于增加农业生产。因此，政府已经规定，一九五五年七月到一九五六年六月这一个粮食年度连征带购粮食八百六十五亿斤，并且决定这个总数三年不变。向农民收购粮食的数字在一定时期内既不能增加，向城市居民销售的粮食数字在一定时期内也就不能增加；相反，把城市突破计划的数字、把不合理地多销的数字加以压缩，却是十分必要和合情合理的。
    第二笔账是使城市居民了解他们消费的粮食是怎样生产出来的，是经过多么艰苦的农业劳动和多么复杂的收购、调运等工作而到达他们手中的。这就是要用鲜明、具体的事实，把粮食生产和供应过程中所耗费的巨大社会劳动和国家所付出的巨额财力、物力告诉广大粮食消费者，使他们真正懂得“一粥一饭，当思来处不易”，激发起他们的节约粮食的积极性和责任感。应当让城市居民了解：全国每年供应城市的四百多亿斤粮食，按照我国目前的农业生产水平，需要二千多万个整劳动力在三亿多亩土地上辛勤劳动一年才能生产出来。为了农业增产，国家在农业方面用了巨大的投资和贷款。从一九五○年到一九五四年，国家在农田水利方面投资一亿六千多万元，农业贷款累计三十七亿五千多万元。一九五四年，国家在粮食收购和销售中间，光是用在运费、杂费方面的补贴，就有两亿多元。北京市展览会中一幅电动地图表明：北京市居民每天吃的粮食，按平均运输里程计算，要行经一千九百二十四里，其中有些粮食是从五千多里以外运来的。展览会里的另一幅展览图表给人们算了这样的几笔账：一九五四年北京市从外地调运来的粮食，如果完全用近代化运输工具来运输，需要三万多个火车厢，或二十三万多辆汽车。展览会的这些材料令人信服地说明：城市居民在粮食消费方面如果不注意节约，就既对不起农民，也对不起国家；如果不把浪费粮食的情况彻底改变，必然会给国家社会主义建设和工农联盟造成严重的损害。
    第三笔账是向城市居民算一算实行粮食统购统销以来城市居民得到的好处，使大家自觉地维护和巩固统购统销的成果。北京市展览会中一幅解放后几年来北京市粮食和几种主要生活必需品价格变化图表明：从一九四九年到一九五○年，这些物品的价格突上突下，而且上升的幅度大，下降的幅度小；从一九五○年到一九五三年秋天，物价已经相对地稳定，但仍有一些波动；而从一九五三年冬季以后，粮食和其他几种主要消费品的价格就完全平稳了。当然，物价平稳的原因是很多的，但粮食和其他若干重要物资的统购统销，是一个极为重要的原因。各个城市都有具体的材料可以说明这一点。实行粮食统销以前，上海市私营米店每担米的售价约比国营粮食公司高出一角钱；实行粮食统销以后，上海市民完全摆脱了这项剥削，每月可省八万元。广州市实行粮食统销后，粮食售价一直稳定在一九五二年的牌价水平上，每担米售价比统销前私商的售价低六、七角钱，这样，全市人民每年可以避免私商剥削数百万元。粮食统购统销政策带给消费者的好处，在最近二十多年来曾经经历过两次洪水灾害的武汉市表现得特别突出。一九三一年武汉市遭受洪水灾害，当时粮价一日数变，比洪水涨得还快；去年，武汉市遭受了比一九三一年大得多的洪水，但由于国家掌握了粮食，全市粮食供应充足，粮食价格丝毫未变。武汉市居民描述这种情形说：“从水涨到水落，粮价稳如泰山！”宣传粮食统销对城市人民的好处，应当把贯彻粮食统销政策和节约粮食的关系解释清楚，使大家懂得：为了巩固粮食统销的成果，必须逐步用更完善的制度贯彻实行粮食统销政策；每个消费者都要好好地坚决遵守粮食供应制度，尽最大可能节约粮食。城市居民越是自觉地维护粮食统销政策，遵守粮食供应制度，城市的粮食供应就越有可靠的保证。
    向城市居民算这样三笔账，是为了让他们了解国家的粮食生产、购销状况，了解本市粮食消费的状况，以主人翁的态度来参加节约粮食的工作；是为了使他们一方面心中有数，消除顾虑，一方面精打细算，共同管理我们的“大家务”。陈云同志在全国人民代表大会第二次会议上号召全国人民在正常消费水平上每人每天节约半两粮食，把这种节约制度长时期地坚持下去，在一定时期内储备起一定数量的粮食，以应付可能发生的意外事变。我们应当运用上面说的算账的方法和其他的方法，向广大人民广泛宣传这个思想，使大家都懂得节约粮食的深远意义，积极地自觉地行动起来，在节约粮食方面做出更大的成绩。
