    Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province: The Hangzhou Municipal Bureau of Industry has promoted the "Shuttle Box Automatic Tightening Device" in more than 100 factories this year, including Qunli, Yong'an, Zhejiang Silk Factory, and Hangzhou No. 1 Cotton Mill Weaving Factory, saving electricity and supplies.
    The installation of the "Shuttle Box Automatic Tightening Device" on looms reduces the resistance of the shuttle, making the loom operate smoothly and stably, avoiding problems such as "sudden shuttle" and "shuttle jamming," saving electricity, and reducing the consumption of supplies. According to statistics from the Hangzhou Municipal Bureau of Industry, the 2,690 looms in the city that have installed the "Shuttle Box Automatic Tightening Device" have saved more than 152,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity in the past six months, and the saved supplies (leather knots, shuttles, etc.) are worth more than 12,000 yuan. According to relevant calculations, the widespread installation of the "Shuttle Box Automatic Tightening Device" on silk and cloth looms with suitable conditions throughout the city can save more than 400,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity each year and save supplies worth more than 60,000 yuan.

    杭州许多绸厂、布厂推广“梭箱自动松紧装置”
    浙江省杭州市工业局今年在群利、永安、浙江绸厂和杭州第一纱厂织布工厂等一百多家工厂中推广“梭箱自动松紧装置”，节省了用电和机物料。
    织机安装“梭箱自动松紧装置”，使投梭阻力减轻，织机运转轻松稳定，避免了“急梭”、“轧梭”等毛病，节省了用电，减少了机物料的消耗。据杭州市工业局统计，全市已安装“梭箱自动松紧装置”的二千六百九十台织机，半年来共节省用电十五万二千多度，节约的机物料（皮结、梭子等）共值一万二千多元。据有关方面计算，在全市有条件的绸、布织机上普遍安装“梭箱自动松紧装置”，每年可以节省用电四十多万度，并可节省价值六万多元的机物料。（本报驻杭州记者）
