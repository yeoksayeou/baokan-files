    An Ugly Soul
    To the Editor:
    I am a mother of two children, a woman who has been deceived and humiliated. I want to accuse my former husband, Huhetela (original name Ju Renbatu), of his ugly behavior of toying with women and tormenting children.
    Huhetela is a revolutionary literary and art worker, a Communist Party member; but his moral character is extremely vile and ugly. In 1950, he forcibly divorced his original lover. At that time, he was the Organization and Education Section Chief of the Rehe Provincial Cultural Work Troupe, and he used his position to scour the files of female comrades in the troupe to find his "ideal" lover. Finally, he lured me into marrying him.
    After the marriage, Huhetela treated me as his "private property," insulting and abusing me at will. For example, one day, just half a month after the wedding, when I was reporting on the ideological situation of the Communist Youth League members, I mentioned a comrade with whom I had a brief friendship. He suddenly kicked me to the ground and cursed, "You shameless thing, you still want to marry him?"
    In 1951, I had a child. He was already tired of me and began looking for a new "ideal lover." He asked the organization to send a certain female comrade to help him with his creative work, but in reality, he was using this as an excuse for his vile activities. In order to please this female comrade, he inhumanely allowed the child to go without milk powder, taking the child's childcare expenses to buy watches and make clothes. During my second pregnancy, he tormented me in every possible way, repeatedly forcing me to go to court for a divorce. He even slanderously said, "The child is not mine." In the spring of 1953, we were both put on a salary system, and he took no responsibility for the lives of the two children.
    The Party and comrades have repeatedly criticized his mistakes. However, he has always adopted a two-faced attitude, hypocritically admitting his mistakes in person while resolutely refusing to change in practice. He once said, "I have been a revolutionary for over ten years. What can the Party do to me for this little thing?"
    At the end of 1953, the organization sent him to study at the Central Academy of Drama in Beijing. After he arrived at the school, he wrote to me again requesting a divorce. At this time, I had also made up my mind to divorce him and had already gone to the People's Court to complete the divorce formalities. However, when he returned for the summer vacation, he actually expressed to the leading comrades and to me that he wanted to repent and reform, and he guaranteed to the People's Court that he would no longer request a divorce. After he returned to school, he even wrote to me expressing his desire to improve our relationship. Last December, when I went to the Soviet Exhibition Center in Beijing, I took the opportunity to visit him and lived with him for a few days. At that time, he strangely asked me if I had received his most recent letter; and when I explained that I had not received this letter, he awkwardly changed the subject. I didn't know what he was up to at first, but when I returned home, I found out that what he was talking about was a letter requesting a divorce. Soon after, I received another letter from him saying, "The few days you came to Beijing to live with me were just a matter between a man and a woman before a divorce, right?" Only then did I realize that all his above-mentioned tactics were just to trick me into temporarily living with him.
      I could no longer continue to live with such an ugly person, and I finally divorced him this year. The court ordered him to pay fifty yuan per month for the children's living expenses; however, he has refused to comply for several months. Recently, because the child fell ill, I was unable to afford the treatment expenses alone, so I asked the court to send him a letter. However, he ignored the court's letter. Later, the court called his current work unit (the Cultural Bureau of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region), and the problem was initially resolved.
    It is not difficult to imagine that such a despicable and shameless person would not treat revolutionary work with the correct attitude. He shamelessly claimed that he wanted to be the "Chinese Paul Korchagin," and even used this to brag about himself every time he seduced a woman. But in reality, he relished talking about how much royalties a certain writer received and how a certain writer became famous at a young age. What he pursued was: becoming a famous writer, earning a lot of royalties, building a comfortable and spacious house, and having a young and beautiful lover to help him copy and write. His performance at work was: he has not written anything in recent years; when he went to the countryside to experience life, he sat on the peasant's kang like a lord all day long, requiring others to serve him food, and in his free time, he would fool around with the daughter of a certain agricultural production cooperative director and a certain female worker in the county.
    I believe that Huhetela is a degenerate element within the Party, a disgrace to the people of New China. I suggest that the relevant Party organizations and administrative leading organs seriously handle his problem.

### 一个丑恶的灵魂

    一个丑恶的灵魂编辑同志：
    我是一个有了两个孩子的母亲，是一个受欺骗、受侮辱的妇女。我要控诉我原来的丈夫呼和他拉（原名举仁巴图）玩弄女性、折磨孩子的丑恶行为。
    呼和他拉是一个革命的文艺工作人员，一个共产党员；但是他的道德品质却是极端卑污丑恶的。一九五○年，他用强迫手段同原来的爱人离了婚。当时他是热河省文工团的组织教育科长，他就利用职权，遍翻文工团女同志的档案材料，来寻找他所
  “理想”的爱人。最后，他诱骗我同他结了婚。
    结婚以后，呼和他拉就把我当成他的“私有物”，任意侮辱虐待。例如，在婚后刚半个月的一天，我向他汇报青年团员的思想情况时，提到一位曾同我有过短时期友谊的同志，他突然一脚把我踢倒，并且辱骂我说：“你这个没脸的东西，你还想嫁给他？”
    一九五一年，我有了孩子。他已厌恶我了，又开始物色新的“理想的爱人”。他要求组织上派某女同志帮助他进行创作，实际上是借此进行他卑污的活动。为了讨这位女同志的欢心，他毫无人性地听凭孩子没有奶粉吃，把孩子的保育费拿去买手表、做衣服。当我第二次怀孕期间，他又百般地折磨我，无数次地逼我去法院离婚。并且血口喷人说：“孩子不是我的。”一九五三年春天，我们都改为薪金制，他对两个孩子的生活就丝毫不负责任了。
    党和同志们对他的错误曾不断提出批评。但是他却一直采取了当面虚伪地承认错误而实际上坚决不改的两面派态度。他曾经这末说：“我革命十来年了。为了这点事，党还能把我怎么的？”
    一九五三年末，组织上派他到北京中央戏剧学院去学习。他到学校后又来信要求同我离婚。这时我也下定了离婚的决心，并且已经向人民法院办理离婚手续。但是，他放暑假回来时，居然向领导同志和我表示要悔改前非，并向人民法院保证不再要求离婚了。在他回到学校以后，还来信表示要搞好夫妇关系。去年十二月，我到北京苏联展览馆参观时，还顺便去看他，和他共同生活了几天。那时，他曾经奇怪地问我是否接到他最近的信；而当我说明没有接到这封信时他又很不自然地把这件事扯开不谈了。我先还不知道他葫芦里卖什么药，回家后才知道他所说的是一封要求离婚的信，不久又接到他一封信里面说：“你来北京同居的那几天，只不过是没离婚前男女之间那末回事吧。”我这才知道，他以上那一套手法，只不过是要骗我暂时和他同居吧了。
      我再也不能同这样一个丑恶的人继续生活下去了，我终于在今年同他离婚了。法院判决他每月要补助孩子的抚养费五十元；但是几个多月来他一直拒不执行。最近因为孩子害病，我一个人无力负担治疗费用，就请法院给他去信。但是他对法院的信置之不理。后来法院给他现在的工作机关（内蒙古自治区文化局）去电话，问题才算初步解决了。
    不难想像，像这样一个卑鄙无耻的人，是不会用正确的态度对待革命工作的。他恬不知耻地口口声声说要做“中国的保尔·柯察金”，甚至在每次诱骗妇女时都用这来自我吹嘘。但是实际上，他津津乐道的是那一个作家拿了多少稿费，那一个作家年纪轻轻就出了名。他所追求的是：成了名作家，稿费收入很多，盖一座舒适宽敞的房子，身旁有一个年轻漂亮的爱人帮他抄抄写写。他在工作中的表现是：几年来并没有写出什么东西；当他到农村体验生活时，整天像老爷似的坐在农民炕上，吃饭还要别人代盛，闲时就同某农业生产合作社主任的姑娘和县里的某女工作人员胡缠。
    我认为，呼和他拉是党内的蜕化堕落分子，是新中国人民中的败类。建议有关的党组织和行政领导机关严肃处理他的问题。
