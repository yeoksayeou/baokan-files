How the Dongsi District of Beijing Mobilized Residents to Set Grain Consumption Plans
    Li Yarú
    The Dongsi District of Beijing launched a campaign in early June to have all residents set household-based grain consumption plans and verify these plans. This work was basically completed by late July, with over 60,000 households in the district having set relatively realistic grain consumption plans. Through propaganda and the setting of plans, all residents received a profound and vivid socialist education, establishing the concept of conserving grain, opposing waste, and obeying state planning. Among the broad masses, the phenomenon of wasting grain has been greatly reduced. The masses reflected: "You can't see leftover rice or cornbread in the dirt baskets anymore!" "Even children know to conserve grain, not scattering or throwing food around while eating." For example, at the Ministry of Railways dormitory, leftover food and noodles were often dumped in the sewage pool, causing it to frequently become clogged. Now, the sewage pool there is unobstructed. The masses reflected: "We've saved grain and improved hygiene too." The phenomena of falsely reporting population to obtain excess grain and speculative purchasing of grain have been basically eliminated. Through setting grain consumption plans, residents' reasonable needs are guaranteed on the one hand; on the other hand, the unreasonable portion of grain sales has been greatly compressed. Since June, grain sales in the district have gradually decreased. The district's grain sales in May were more than 9.92 million jin, 9.54 million jin in June, and 8.28 million jin in July. July was down 16.48% compared to May, and 13.13% compared to June.

    In the past, urban residents generally had no habit of setting grain consumption plans. Upon hearing that plans were to be set, some residents thought grain was becoming "tight" and were afraid they wouldn't be able to buy grain in the future, causing some panic. Many residents were unsure how much grain they needed to eat each month, fearing that the plans would be set too low and wouldn't be enough. Some also planned to entertain relatives and guests, all wanting to set the plans higher, "padding them for backup." Some residents mistakenly believed: "Waste is in the organs, speculation is in the hands of profiteers, there's nothing for residents to save," thinking that setting plans was "just adding trouble," and therefore were unwilling to calculate carefully. Some simply based their plans on the habit of "one jin of grain per person per day." A few others listened to rumors and rushed to buy grain. In response to these situations, we vigorously launched propaganda work, combined with the masses' thinking, exposing examples of grain being shipped out and wasted, criticizing erroneous ideas such as "residents don't waste," emphasizing guaranteeing grain supply, and explaining that conserving grain and strengthening planned supply are important measures to ensure socialist construction. When distributing "Resident Planned Grain Consumption Application Forms," we also focused on criticizing the idea of "padding for backup," proposing the requirement of "careful calculation," and pointing out that carefully setting grain consumption plans is a manifestation of the people being "masters of their own house," inspiring the masses' consciousness. After propaganda, various ideological doubts began to dissipate, and some residents began to realistically set their grain consumption plans.

    However, when the work entered the planning stage, many people still had ideological concerns. Among these people, some were temporarily unclear about how much grain they actually needed to eat and how much they could save, or lacked specific methods for setting plans; others considered personal interests and tried various ways to increase their planned grain consumption figures. For example, in order to exaggerate the actual amount of grain their families consumed, some concealed the past visits of relatives and guests, over-reported past grain purchase figures, and a few even altered their grain purchase certificates. Some residents also deliberately set the plans high, in order to "bargain." In the face of this complex situation, we adopted a method of typical demonstrations, selecting representative people to introduce the specific process and methods of setting their plans at mass meetings, using specific examples to conduct vivid education for the masses. Through the education of typical examples, the masses' ideological concerns were eliminated, various erroneous ideas were criticized, and the masses were called upon to learn from the households that had already set plans. This approach was very persuasive.

    At the typical demonstration meetings, we also mobilized the masses to calculate detailed accounts, pointing out that only by carefully calculating detailed accounts can plans be set realistically. Therefore, "calculate detailed accounts" became a resounding slogan. The broad masses all flipped through their grain purchase certificates, calculating their grain purchase quantities and actual grain consumption from January to May this year, recalling the changes in family population from January to May and the current situation, and calculating how much grain they would eat in June. Many households that previously did not know how much grain they ate in a month were clear after calculating detailed accounts and smoothly set their grain consumption plans. In the work of approving grain consumption plans, we also grasped the principle of "easy first, difficult later," approving plans in batches, so that the first plans set influenced and helped the later plans, quickly mobilizing the majority of advanced households to lead and educate the minority of backward households. This ensured that the work progressed smoothly, without being bogged down by some "difficult households," and that thousands of residents' grain consumption plans could be approved in a relatively short period of time.

    Through these efforts, the idea that grain is precious, opposing waste, and practicing thrift has taken root in people's hearts, and a habit of cherishing grain has gradually formed among residents. Some have even created many ways to save grain. The vast majority of working people and staff and worker families have gradually realized the benefits of verifying grain consumption plans for the country and themselves, and have expressed their support for setting grain consumption plans. For example, Wang Zhong, a resident of No. 10 Wenchengxiang Hutong, reduced waste and saved expenses after setting plans in June and July. In the past, the cooking utensils were insufficient and had not been replaced. In July, he bought utensils with the savings. Wang Zhong said: "Setting plans is good for the country, and our family lives become more prosperous, and we are more careful with spending money."

    The requirements of this work are: on the one hand, to compress the unreasonable supply of grain; on the other hand, to ensure reasonable supply. Therefore, the key to mastering policy lies in whether the planned figures are appropriate, preventing excessively high or low figures. In our work, we have grasped the spirit of "saving" and "enough to eat," and have repeatedly organized staff to study the methods of reviewing grain consumption plans, and have organized special personnel to focus on checking the quality of the work of each work group in approving grain consumption plans. At the beginning of setting grain consumption plans for July, a relatively detailed review was conducted throughout the district. Some excessively high or low planned figures were corrected, further improving the masses' understanding of the work of verifying supply. For example, after the Nafu Hutong work group adjusted the plans of some households with excessively high or low figures, Du Lao Tai Tai (Old Woman Du), whose original plan was appropriate and still wanted to increase the plan, said with emotion: "I was too stubborn in the past, always afraid of not having enough to eat, always wanting to be richer. Now I don't ask for more."

    Setting grain consumption plans on a household basis is an arduous and complex task. The entire process, from the beginning of propaganda to setting the plans, contains a fierce struggle between new and old ideas and habits. In this struggle, we clarified the principle of relying on organized masses. Organized personnel in organs, organizations, enterprises, and schools account for a large portion of the residents in the district. We mainly adopted the following two methods to mobilize them: First, mobilize by system. We convened meetings of responsible persons from organs, organizations, schools, and enterprises, requiring them to not only set grain consumption plans for their own units, but also educate their staff to carefully help their families, relatives, and neighbors set plans. At the same time, we conducted various propaganda and mobilization efforts for workers and staff in different ways. Many units designated special personnel to assist us in doing family work in their own units. The Chinese People's University also specifically established an inspection team to specifically help the family dormitories scattered in various places of their school to set grain consumption plans. After discovering that some family members were setting plans too high, the Third Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building mobilized in the dormitories by the director of the administrative office, which played a great role in setting grain consumption plans. Second, convene meetings of scattered workers, staff, and students to explain the current work situation and the difficulties encountered, requesting them to assist in solving problems and play a model leading role. These people have close daily contact with the masses and have a certain prestige among the masses. They are also relatively easy to understand and accept the significance of conserving grain and the methods of setting grain consumption plans. By relying on them, we can obtain great support in our work. All twenty work groups in Dongsi District held such meetings.

    In order to complete this task in a short period of time, we also brought the role of the neighborhood committees into play. The grain consumption plans of the vast majority of neighborhood committee members were set and approved before ordinary residents began setting plans. They generally firmly support this measure by the government. In the work of approving residents' grain consumption plans, various neighborhood committees have played a great role in introducing the situation, assisting the work groups in reviewing plans, explaining and mobilizing residents, and focusing on helping to calculate accounts. In the final stage of residents setting grain consumption plans, some neighborhood committees also convened special meetings to mobilize and evaluate the few households that were unwilling to realistically set plans. Such evaluation meetings educated the "difficult households" being evaluated and also educated the surrounding residents.

    北京东四区是怎样发动居民定用粮计划的
    李亚儒
    北京市东四区于六月上旬在全区居民中开展了按户制定用粮计划和核实用粮计划的工作。至七月下旬基本结束，全区六万多户居民都已经定出较切实际的用粮计划。通过宣传和制定计划，使全区居民受到了一次深刻的、生动的社会主义教育，树立了节约粮食、反对浪费和服从国家计划的观念。在广大群众中，浪费粮食的现象已大大减少了。群众反映：“土筐里看不见剩饭和窝头啦！”“小孩也知道要节约粮食，吃饭的时候不乱撒乱扔了。”如铁道部宿舍，过去常有剩饭剩面倒在秽水池里，致水池经常堵塞。现在，那里的秽水池已畅通无阻。群众反映：“节约了粮食，卫生也搞好了。”虚报人口冒领粮食、投机套购粮食的现象已基本消除。通过定用粮计划，一方面全区居民合理的需要得到保证；另一方面，粮食销售量中不合理的部分已大大压缩。从六月份起，全区粮食销售量已逐渐下降。五月份全区粮食销售量为九百九十二万多斤，六月份为九百五十四万多斤，七月份为八百二十八万多斤，七月份较五月份降低了百分之十六点四八，比六月份降低了百分之十三点一三。
    在广大城市居民中，过去向来没有定用粮计划的习惯。一听说要定计划，有的居民以为粮食要“紧”了，怕以后买不着粮食，产生了一些恐慌心理；许多居民对于自己每月需要吃多少粮食心中没底，怕计划定低了不够吃；有的还打算招待亲属和客人，都想把计划定高一些，“宽打备用”。有的居民错误地认为：“浪费在机关，捣卖在奸商，居民中没有什么可节约的”，认为定计划是“白添麻烦”，因而还不肯精打细算。有的只是根据“一人一天一斤粮”的习惯来定自己的计划。还有少数人听信谣言，抢购粮食。针对这些情况，我们大力展开了宣传工作，结合群众思想，揭露了外运和浪费粮食的实例，批判了“居民没浪费”等错误思想，强调了保证粮食供应，说明节约粮食、加强计划供应是保证社会主义建设的一项重要措施。在发“居民计划用粮申请书”的时候，又集中地批判了“宽打备用”的思想，提出“精打细算”的要求，并指出认真定好用粮计划是人民“当家作主”的表现，启发了群众的自觉性。经过宣传，各种思想疑虑开始消除，一部分居民开始实事求是地定好了自己的用粮计划。
    但是，当工作进入到定计划阶段，许多人仍有思想顾虑。这些人中，一部分是一时弄不清自己究竟要吃多少粮食，可以节约多少，或缺乏定计划的具体办法；另一部分是考虑个人利益，想各种办法提高自己的计划用粮数字。如为了夸大自己家庭实际吃粮的数量，有的还隐瞒过去亲戚和客人来家吃饭的情况，多报过去的购粮数字，个别人还有涂改购粮证的。有些居民还故意把计划定高，以备“要价还价”。在这种复杂的情况面前，我们采取了典型示范的办法，选择有代表性的人，在群众会上介绍自己制定计划的具体经过和办法，以具体事例向群众进行生动的教育。通过典型事例的教育，消除群众的思想顾虑，批判各种错误思想，号召群众向已定计划的户学习。这种方式具有很大的说服力。
    在典型示范会上，我们还发动群众算细账，指出只有认真算好细账才能切合实际地定好计划。因此，“算细账”成了一句响亮的口号。广大群众都纷纷翻阅购粮证，计算自己今年一月至五月的购粮数量和实际吃粮数量，回忆一月至五月和目前的家庭人口变化等情况，计算六月份究竟要吃多少粮食。许多过去不知道自己一个月吃多少粮食的住户，通过算细账心中有底了，顺利地定下了用粮计划。在核批用粮计划的工作中，我们还掌握了“先易后难”的原则，分批核准计划，使先定的户影响和帮助后定的，迅速发动多数先进户，以带动和教育少数落后户。这样，才能使工作进展顺利，而不致被一些“难定户”缠住；才能在较短的时间内，核批数以千计的居民用粮计划。
    经过这些工作，粮食宝贵、反对浪费、厉行节约的思想已深入人心，居民中已逐渐形成爱护粮食的风气。有的还创造了不少节约粮食的办法。绝大多数劳动人民和职工家属，逐渐认识到核实用粮计划对国家和对自己的好处，对于定用粮计划都表示拥护。如文丞相胡同十号居民王忠，六、七月份定计划后，减少了浪费，节约了开支，过去做饭的家具不够，一直置不上，七月份以节约的费用置买了用具。王忠说：“定了计划，对国家有好处，我们家过日子也显得宽裕，用钱把准了。”
    这次工作的要求是：一方面要压缩粮食不合理的供应量，一方面要保证合理供应，因而掌握政策的关键就在于计划数字是否合适，防止偏高偏低现象。我们在工作中掌握了“节约”“够吃”的精神，多次组织工作人员学习了审查用粮计划的方法，并组织专人重点检查各工作组核批用粮计划的工作质量。在开始制定七月份用粮计划时，又在全区进行了比较细致的复查工作。纠正了一些计划数字偏高偏低的情况，进一步提高了群众对核实供应工作的认识。如纳福胡同工作组调整一些偏高偏低户的计划后，原来计划合适、还想提高计划的杜老太太感动地说：“我过去太顽固了，老怕不够吃，总愿意富裕点。现在我也不要求多定了。”
    按户制定用粮计划是一项艰巨的、复杂的工作。从开始宣传到定好计划的整个工作过程中，包含激烈的新旧思想、习惯的斗争。在这个斗争中，我们明确了必须依靠有组织群众的原则。机关、团体、企业、学校中有组织的人员占区内居民很大的一部分，对他们主要采取了以下两个办法进行动员：一、按系统进行动员。我们曾召开机关、团体、学校、企业等单位负责人会议，要求他们除定好本单位的用粮计划外，并教育本机关的工作人员认真帮助自己家庭、亲友、邻居定好计划。同时，我们又分头向工人、机关工作人员进行了各种宣传动员工作，许多单位指定专人协助我们做本单位的家属工作。中国人民大学还专门成立了检查组，具体帮助他们学校散居在各处的家属宿舍定用粮计划。第一机械工业部第三局发现有些家属定计划偏高的情况后，行政处处长亲自到宿舍进行了动员，对定用粮计划起了很大的作用。二、召集散居的工人、机关工作人员、学生开会，说明目前工作情况和遇到的困难，要求他们协助解决，并起模范带头作用。这些人同群众的日常联系密切，在群众中有一定的威信，他们对节约粮食的意义和定用粮计划的方法也比较容易领会和接受。依靠他们，工作中就可以获得很大的支援。东四区二十个工作组都召开了这样会议。
    为了在短期内完成这项任务，我们还发挥了居民委员会的作用。绝大多数居民委员的用粮计划在一般居民开始定计划以前就定好了，并已获得批准。他们一般都坚决拥护政府这一措施。在核批居民用粮计划的工作中，各个居民委员会在介绍情况、协助工作组审查计划、向居民进行解释动员及有重点地帮助算账等方面，都发挥了很大作用。在居民定用粮计划的最后阶段，有些居民委员会还专门召开会议，对少数不肯切实定好计划的户进行动员和评议。这样的评议会，教育了被评议的“难定户”，也教育了周围的居民群众。
