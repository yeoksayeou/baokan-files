To the Editor:

　　The Qilian Mountains are a treasure mountain of our motherland. When the comrades of our Qilian Mountains Prospecting Team were working in the Qilian Mountains, they received enthusiastic care and strong support from the people of all ethnic groups in the area. This encouraged our courage to overcome difficulties and enhanced our determination and confidence in completing our tasks.

　　Some of our comrades arrived in the Sunan Yugur Autonomous Region of Jiuquan Prefecture, Gansu Province, at the end of April. The responsible comrades of the local Party committee gave us a report on ethnic policies. Ma Laozhuang, the 58-year-old deputy county chief, a Tibetan who grew up in the Qilian Mountains, gave us a detailed introduction to the situation in the Qilian Mountains. After we went down to the districts and townships, people of fraternal ethnic groups reported mineral deposits to us and introduced us to the situation wherever we went. Once, a Tibetan township chief, Yu Tedan, was guiding us to see a silver cave when a Tibetan shepherd came from a distant mountain top to tell us that there was a strange stone on a hillside nearby, the color of which was the same as the earrings of Tibetan women. We ran over and saw malachite, azurite, and other copper ore strewn all over the ground. It turned out that this was a promising non-ferrous metal mineral deposit.

　　In mid-June, we arrived in Sunan again. County Chief An Guanbushijia (Yugur), who had just returned from surveying the grasslands in the back mountains for more than 20 days, was extremely happy to hear that we had come to the Qilian Mountains to look for minerals. He insisted on accompanying us to the snow-capped mountains to see the Hongtong Gorge, which the Yugur people say is rich in native copper. So, we rode several fine horses, led by County Chief An, passed through dozens of miles of primeval forest, climbed over high mountains, crossed the icy, rapid, arrow-like deep water of the canyon, and crossed the grassland plateau covered with thorns and knee-deep mud. After two days of walking, we finally reached the snow-capped mountains at an altitude of more than 4,500 meters. That night, the 57-year-old County Chief An led us to climb through thorns, wade through ice rivers, and climb ice blocks to reach Hongtong Gorge. It turned out to be a quartzite gorge sandwiched between andesite, with no native copper. However, this trip enabled us to basically understand the general geological conditions of the snow-capped mountains, which greatly helped our work of finding minerals in the Qilian Mountains.

　　During the journey, County Chief An Guanbushijia excitedly said: "In the era of the reactionaries, we were unwilling to talk about what minerals were in the Qilian Mountains. Because if the reactionaries knew about it, it would bring us great disasters: they would ask for cattle and sheep today, and people tomorrow, making it impossible for us to live in peace. Now that our minority people have turned over. We know that the treasures in the Qilian Mountains are resources needed for the socialist industrialization of the motherland, and also the source of happiness for our Sunan minority people. Therefore, no matter how high the mountains, how deep the water, or how thick the snow in the Qilian Mountains, we will do our best to support you, find out all the underground treasures in every corner of the Qilian Mountains, and support the great socialist construction of the motherland." From our experience in our work, these words also represent the common aspirations of the people of all ethnic groups in the Sunan Yugur Autonomous Region.

### 把祁连山里一切地下宝藏都找出来

　　把祁连山里一切地下宝藏都找出来编辑同志：
    祁连山是祖国的一座宝山。我们祁连山普查大队的同志在祁连山区进行工作的时候，受到了当地各族人民热情的关怀和有力的支援。这鼓舞了我们克服困难的勇气，提高了我们完成任务的决心和信心。
    我们一部分同志在四月底到了甘肃省酒泉专区的肃南裕固族自治区，当地党委的负责同志对我们作了关于民族政策的报告；五十八岁的马老庄副县长是一个在祁连山里长大的藏民，他详细地向我们介绍了祁连山内的情况。当我们下区、下乡以后，每到一个地方都有兄弟民族人民报矿，并向我们介绍情况。有一次，一个藏族乡长于特旦正引导我们看一个银硐子，这时候一个放羊的藏民老乡从很远的一个山头上赶来，告诉我们附近一个山腰里有一种奇怪的石头，颜色和藏族妇女的耳环一样蓝。我们跑去，看到满地都是孔雀石、蓝铜矿的转石和其他的铜矿石，原来这是一个有希望的有色金属矿产地。
    六月中旬，我们又到了肃南。安官布什加县长
  （裕固族）刚从后山踏勘了二十多天的草原回来，听说我们来祁连山里找矿，他高兴非凡，坚持要陪我们去雪山看一下裕固族人民传说盛产自然铜的红铜峡。于是，我们骑了几匹骏马，由安县长带路，穿过了几十里宽的原始森林地带，翻过了高山，渡过了冷澈骨、急似箭的峡谷深水，又越过了满地荆棘、泥泞没膝的草原大板，走了两天，终于到了海拔四千五百公尺以上的雪山上。五十七岁的安县长当晚又领我们攀刺援棘，涉冰河，登冰块，到了红铜峡。原来这是一个石英岩夹安山岩的石峡，并没有什么自然铜。但是这一次使我们能够基本上了解了雪山一带一般的地质情况，对我们在祁连山里找矿的工作有很大帮助。
    在旅途中，安官布什加县长曾兴奋地说：“在反动派时代，祁连山里有什么矿，我们谁也不肯说。因为如果被反动派知道了，反而给我们带来了很大的灾害：他今天要牛羊，明天要人，闹得我们没法安生。现在我们少数民族人民翻身了。我们知道：祁连山里的宝藏，是祖国社会主义工业化需要的资源，也是我们肃南少数民族幸福的泉源。因此，不怕祁连山的山多高，水多深，雪多厚，我们一定全力支援你们，把祁连山每一个角落里的一切地下宝藏都找出来，支援祖国伟大的社会主义建设。”从我们工作中的经历来看，这些话也正代表了肃南裕固族自治区各族人民共同的心意。
