Xinhua News Agency, August 28th – Four National People's Congress deputies currently in Beijing, who have inspected grain unified purchase and supply work, told our reporter: The State Council's promulgation of the "Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Supply of Grain in Rural Areas" and the "Provisional Measures for Rationed Grain Supply in Towns and Cities" is very timely, and it fully meets the demands and wishes of urban and rural people.

Representative Zhang Zhirang, who visited Zhuoxian County, Hebei Province, said: The peasant masses wholeheartedly support the policy of unified grain purchase and supply. He said that a farmer in Huayuan Village, Zhuoxian County, told him: "Implementing unified grain purchase and supply can ensure that the masses have grain to eat throughout the year, and grain prices are stable. When grain is scarce, buying grain is no longer a losing proposition and we are no longer exploited." He believes that the implementation of these two measures will make the unified grain purchase and supply work and the grain distribution system more rational, effectively guarantee the grain supply to urban and rural people, and effectively conserve grain and prevent waste.

Representative Zhang Weizhen, who visited Benxi City, Liaoning Province, said: Before the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, I held five discussions with workers and their families in Benxi City. They told me cordially that the implementation of unified grain purchase and supply means that grain-deficient households do not have to worry about not being able to buy grain, and grain prices are stable, guaranteeing the grain needs of workers and urban residents. Now that cities and towns are implementing a system of rationed grain supply, the grain supply system will be more sound and rational. Our workers, their families, and staff of the workers' canteens will certainly be able to use our wisdom and play a exemplary role in implementing the state's grain policy.

Representative Xu Wentian, who visited Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province, said: In the past, Suzhou City's grain supply work was too lax, and the supply standards were generally too high, resulting in waste of grain. After the implementation of the rationed supply measures, the grain distribution system will be more rational and the supply will be more guaranteed.

Representative Shen Qiyi, who visited disaster areas in Anhui Province, said: In the villages I visited, the peasants all excitedly talked about the different situations of disaster relief during the Kuomintang reactionary rule and now. Wang Shichang, a farmer in Baize Township, Huaining County, said to me: In the past, when there was a disaster, landlords and unscrupulous merchants hoarded grain, and peasants sold their sons and daughters, their wives were scattered, and many people starved to death; last year, when there was a disaster, the government sent cadres to deliver grain to our homes in the wind and snow. This is the benefit of unified grain purchase and supply. Shen Qiyi said: The state stipulates that the amount of grain purchased from farmers will remain unchanged for three years, which will further encourage farmers' production enthusiasm, increase grain production, and support the country's socialist construction.

　　全国人民代表大会代表张志让等发表谈话
　　新的粮食法令完全符合城乡人民的愿望
    新华社二十八日讯　曾经视察过粮食统购统销工作的现在在北京的四位全国人民代表大会代表向本社记者说：国务院公布的“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”和“市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”是非常适时的，它完全符合城乡人民的要求和愿望。
    曾到河北省涿县视察的张志让代表说：农民群众对粮食统购统销政策是衷心拥护的。他说，涿县花园村一个农民曾对他说：“实行粮食统购统销能保证群众一年到头有粮吃，粮价又稳定，在缺粮时买粮再不吃亏、再不受剥削了。”他认为这两个办法的实行，将使粮食统购统销工作和粮食分配制度更加合理，可以切实保证对城乡人民的粮食供应，有效地节约粮食，防止浪费。
    曾到辽宁省本溪市视察的张维桢代表说：在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议之前，我曾和本溪市的工人、工人家属们进行了五次座谈。他们亲切地告诉我，实行粮食统购统销，缺粮户不用担心买不到粮食，而且粮价平稳，保证了工人和城市居民的粮食需要。现在市镇实行粮食定量供应，将使粮食供应制度更加健全和合理。我们工人、工人家属和职工食堂工作人员，一定能发挥自己的智慧，在执行国家粮食政策中起模范作用。
    到过江苏省苏州市视察的许闻天代表说：苏州市粮食统销工作过去是偏松的，供应标准一般是偏高的，造成了粮食的浪费。定量供应办法实行后，将使粮食分配制度更加合理，供应更加获得保证。
    到安徽省灾区视察过的沈其益代表说：我所到过的乡村，农民们都激动地说到在国民党反动统治时期受灾和现在受灾的不同情景。怀宁县白泽乡农民王世昌向我说：过去受灾时，地主奸商把粮食囤积起来，农民卖儿卖女，妻离子散，多少人饿死了；去年受了灾，政府派干部冒着大风雪把粮食送到家里。这就是粮食统购统销的好处。沈其益说：国家规定向农民统购粮食数字三年不变，将进一步鼓舞农民的生产热情，增加粮食生产，支援国家的社会主义建设。
