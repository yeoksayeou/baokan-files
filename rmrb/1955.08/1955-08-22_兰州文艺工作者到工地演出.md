Lanzhou Literary and Art Workers Perform for Construction Site Workers

　　In order to enrich the cultural life of basic construction workers, the various troupes, film teams, ballad singers, and some enterprise and school art organizations in Lanzhou City, under the unified leadership of the Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, formed a basic construction cultural service team to tour and perform at basic construction sites. From July 14th to early August, they have already performed eight Qinqiang and Henan opera performances and nine film screenings in Xigu City, Agan Town, and Shimen Gou, which are 30 to 40 miles away from the city. The audience reached more than 35,000 people. At the same time, they also performed song and dance and ballads.

　　Basic construction sites in Lanzhou are generally far away from the city, and it is inconvenient for workers to watch operas and movies. The literary and art workers' tour performances at the construction sites have been warmly welcomed by the workers. Many workers said that they would work hard to complete the tasks assigned by the state ahead of schedule or exceeding the quota, while ensuring quality. The literary and art workers were also educated through conversations and interviews with the workers. They expressed that they would study hard, rehearse better programs, and serve basic construction and production.

　　兰州文艺工作者到工地演出
    为了活跃基本建设职工的文化生活，兰州市各剧团、电影队、曲艺工作者和一些企业、学校中的文艺组织，在中共兰州市委会统一领导下，组成基本建设文化服务队，到基本建设工地巡回演出。从七月十四日起到八月上旬，已经在离城三四十里的西固城、阿干镇、石门沟等地区，演出秦腔、豫剧八场、电影九场，观众达三万五千多人。同时，还演出了歌舞和曲艺。
    兰州市基本建设工地一般都距离城市比较远，职工看戏看电影不方便。文艺工作者到工地巡回演出，受到职工们的热烈欢迎。许多职工表示要积极努力，在保证质量的前提下，提前或超额完成国家交给的任务。文艺工作者经过同工人交谈和访问工人，也受到了教育。他们纷纷表示要努力学习，排演出更好的节目，为基本建设和生产服务。
