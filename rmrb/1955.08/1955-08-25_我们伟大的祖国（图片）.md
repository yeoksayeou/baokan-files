    Our Great Motherland
    During the construction of the Guanyinshan Station on the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, an unprecedented large-scale blasting operation was carried out. This blast demolished four hilltops, moving 200,000 cubic meters of rock and earth, equivalent to the workload of 200,000 workers in one day. It ensured the station was completed six months ahead of schedule, saving the state 100,000 yuan. This is a scene from the blasting.
