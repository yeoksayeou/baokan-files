    Eliminate Waste in State-Owned Mechanical Farms

    The management level of state-owned mechanical farms in our country has generally improved over the past few years. In 1954, the per-unit area yield of grain in the 101 state-owned mechanical farms nationwide increased by an average of more than 20% compared to 1953, with the exception of some farms that experienced reduced production due to disasters. The situation of high costs and heavy losses in many farms has been reversed, and nearly 50 farms have already made profits. However, it should be pointed out that the phenomenon of waste in the existing state-owned mechanical farms is still very serious. We must take effective measures to completely eliminate all kinds of waste.

    In some of the farms established earlier with better production conditions, the waste phenomenon is mainly caused by improper technical measures in production. The leading staff there have not done enough research on natural conditions and crop growth patterns, and the combination of mechanical and agricultural technology is not good. New cultivation techniques and new varieties are promoted on a large scale without testing, resulting in reduced production on large areas of land and wasting a lot of manpower and materials. Last year, the State-owned Lutai Farm wasted about 120,000 yuan, of which more than 70% was caused by technical errors (mainly untimely and insufficient irrigation).

    Poor management is a more common phenomenon. Some farms, regardless of subjective and objective conditions, blindly and unpreparedly engage in large-scale land reclamation and purchase production equipment and agricultural machinery without a plan, resulting in serious waste. The State-owned 53rd Farm blindly carried out capital construction, wasting a lot of funds; cultivation delayed the farming season and violated natural conditions, resulting in very poor harvests of large areas of crops; a large number of livestock died, and a large number of machines were stockpiled and damaged. In 1954, the farm lost and wasted 620,000 yuan, some of which was due to the impact of natural disasters, but mainly due to poor management.

    The use of funds in most farms is also unreasonable. Some farms, regardless of the current level of production development, blindly "look up" to cities and large factories, building auditoriums and offices with excessively high standards before the construction of machine warehouses and staff dormitories is completed, and diverting production funds to purchase sofas and non-urgent office supplies. It is even more inappropriate for individual farms to build livestock sheds at excessively high costs. Complex organizational structures and excessive non-production personnel have become a common phenomenon. After several rectifications, non-production personnel in the Yellow River Flood Area Farm still account for more than 34% of the total personnel, equivalent to more than half of the direct production personnel; many agricultural workers are used as odd-job workers. These obviously violate economic principles. The farmers near these state-owned mechanical farms say: "The farms are very good, but we can't afford to learn from them!" This shows that the demonstration effect of these farms on the surrounding farmers has been greatly reduced. Many farms also have low land utilization rates, with more cultivation than planting, and no replanting where replanting is possible, and poor harvesting and storage of grain. For example, the State-owned Tongbei Farm harvested 550 kilograms of soybeans per hectare last year, with an average field loss of 70 to 80 kilograms per hectare.

    There are many reasons for the above phenomena. The most important is that the leading staff of some farms have ideological problems. They do not actually understand that practicing strict economy and opposing waste is the fundamental method of managing socialist enterprises. They still use the supply system mentality and the methods of leading small-scale production to manage this new type of economic undertaking, without making careful calculations, without making thorough plans, and blindly making decisions and acting rashly based on subjective wishes and enthusiasm. Some people are not managing the farms diligently and frugally, but are trying to establish a "socialist life" when production has not yet made achievements or very few achievements. This is also an important reason for the waste phenomenon in the farms. The leaders of the farms must first conduct a deep self-examination of their leadership thinking and methods, eliminate the remnants of the supply system mentality, change the bureaucratic style and extravagant waste practices, establish an enterprise mentality, learn enterprise management methods, rationally organize production, and carefully promote technical measures to avoid all possible losses and waste. In those farms with more problems and more serious losses and waste, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses of employees, carry out criticism and self-criticism, criticize mistakes, promote righteousness, and conduct a comprehensive inspection and rectification from ideology to organization, so that all work can be put on the right track as soon as possible. All farms must, through this practical action of increasing production and practicing economy and opposing waste, take a step forward on the existing basis and establish a regular system of economy.

    Although we still lack experience in managing large-scale state-owned farms, this must not be an excuse for the occurrence of waste. In the existing state-owned farms, some leaders did not have much experience at the beginning, but they were able to rely on the masses of employees, make careful calculations, work hard, and make production profitable soon after the establishment of the farm. Blaming mistakes on objective reasons and relaxing the subjective efforts that should be made will only allow the wrong ideas and practices to continue, causing greater losses to state property. At the present time, we are concentrating our efforts on building the foundation of socialist industrialization, and the state cannot and should not invest more funds in agriculture, which requires all farm workers to earnestly practice economy, oppose waste, use limited funds to do more things, and obtain the greatest results with the least consumption, so that existing farms can produce more grain and industrial raw materials for the country, and become the base for the continued advancement of the state-owned farm business in the future. It is estimated that if the existing farms can reduce the average cost of products by 10%, this fund can establish five or six mechanical farms with 50,000 mu of cultivated land, which shows that the potential of the existing farms is very great.

    In order to run the existing state-owned mechanical farms well, the responsible personnel of each farm should carefully study and resolutely implement the call of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on practicing strict economy and overcoming waste, quickly formulate corresponding plans and measures, mobilize all employees of the farm, check the various waste phenomena in their units, tap potential, and plug loopholes. In the first half of this year, some farms completed the production and financial plan, but many farms did not complete the production and financial plan; the situation of the implementation of the plan in some farms is not very good or very bad. At present, it is the decisive season for farms to complete the annual plan for increasing production and practicing economy. Farms that have completed the production and financial plan for the first half of the year should continue to work hard to strive to overfulfill the annual plan; farms that have not completed the production and financial plan for the first half of the year should make every effort to strive to make up for the part that was not completed in the production in the second half of the year. This year, the natural conditions in most areas are extremely favorable for us to complete the plan; all state-owned farms and ranches should strive to complete and overfulfill the annual plan for increasing production and turning over profits. To this end, each farm should immediately seize the opportunity to check the situation of increasing production and practicing economy in its own farm, do a good job in the harvest of spring wheat, strengthen field management before autumn, as well as cultivating, weeding, hoeing, late autumn sowing and other work, and do a good job in autumn harvest preparation, comprehensively implement increasing production and practicing economy, and strive to complete the 1955 production and financial plan!

### 消灭国营机械农场中的浪费现象

    消灭国营机械农场中的浪费现象
    我国国营机械农场的经营管理水平，几年来一般是有进步的。全国一百零一个国营机械农场，一九五四年除部分因灾减产以外，粮食单位面积产量比一九五三年平均提高百分之二十以上。不少农场成本高、亏损多的局面已经扭转过来，近五十个农场已经有了赢利。但是，应该指出，现有的国营机械农场中的浪费现象还非常严重。我们必须采取有效的措施，把各种浪费现象消灭干净。
    有些建立较早、生产条件较好的农场的浪费现象，主要是由于生产技术措施不当造成的。那里的领导工作人员对自然条件和作物成长规律研究不够，机务技术和农业技术结合不好，不经试验就大规模推广新的耕作技术和新的品种，以致在大面积土地上造成减产现象，浪费大量的人力和物力。国营芦台农场去年浪费约十二万元，其中因技术措施错误（主要是灌水不适时不适量）所造成的浪费竟占百分之七十以上。
    经营管理不善更是普遍的现象。有些农场不顾主客观条件，盲目地无准备地进行大规模的开荒，无计划地购置生产设备和农业机具，结果造成严重的浪费。国营五三农场盲目地进行基本建设，损耗大量资金；耕种贻误农时，违反自然条件，大片作物收成很不好；家畜大批死亡，大批机具被积压和损坏。一九五四年该场亏损、浪费六十二万元，其中部分是由于自然灾害的影响，但主要是经营不善造成的。
    多数农场的资金使用也是不合理的。有些农场不顾目前生产发展的水平，盲目向城市和大工厂“看齐”，在机具仓库、职工宿舍还没有建设以前，就建筑标准过高的礼堂和办公室，并挪用生产资金，置备沙发和不急需的办公用具。个别农场以过高的造价兴建畜舍，更是不妥当的。组织机构庞杂、非生产人员过多已成为普遍的现象。黄泛区农场经过几次整顿，非生产人员还占全体人员百分之三十四以上，相当于直接生产人员的一半以上；许多农业工人被当成杂工使用。这些显然都违背了经济的原则。在这些国营机械农场附近的农民们说：“农场很好，咱们学不起！”这就说明，这些农场对周围农民的示范作用大为降低。还有许多农场土地利用率不高，耕多种少，能复种的没有复种，粮食收获保管不好。例如国营通北农场去年每公顷收获大豆五百五十公斤，平均每公顷田间损失就有七、八十公斤。
    造成上面这些现象的原因是很多的。最主要的是某些农场的领导工作人员的思想作风有毛病。他们实际上不了解厉行节约、反对浪费是经营社会主义企业的根本方法。他们至今仍然以供给制思想和领导小生产的方法来管理这种新型的经济事业，不作精细计算，不作周密计划，凭着主观愿望和热情，盲目地决定，轻率地行动。有些人不是兢兢业业、艰苦朴素地经营农场，而在生产还没有成绩或者成绩很少的时候，就企图建立“社会主义的生活”，这也是造成农场浪费现象的一个重要原因。农场的领导人员首先要从领导思想和领导方法上进行深刻的检查，肃清供给制思想的残余，改变机关化作风和铺张浪费的作法，树立企业化思想，学会企业化经营方法，合理组织生产，慎重推行技术措施，避免一切可能的损失和浪费。在那些问题较多，损失浪费较严重的农场，必须充分发动职工群众，开展批评和自我批评，批判错误，发扬正气，从思想到组织进行全面的检查整顿，使各种工作早日纳入正轨。所有的农场都要经过这次增产节约、反对浪费的实际行动，在现有的基础上前进一步，把经常性的节约制度建立起来。
    我们虽然还缺乏经营大规模的国营农场的经验；但这绝不能成为发生浪费现象的遁辞。在现有的国营农场中，有些领导人员开始也没有什么经验，但他们能够依靠职工群众，精打细算，艰苦奋斗，在建场不久就使生产获得收益。把错误推给客观原因，放松主观上应有的努力，这只能使错误的思想和作法继续下去，使国家资财遭受更大的损失。在目前时期，我们正集中力量建设社会主义工业化的基础，国家还不可能也不应该在农业方面投放更多的资金，这就要求所有农场工作人员，认真地厉行节约，反对浪费，以有限的资金，办更多的事情，以最少的消耗，获得最大的成果，使现有农场为国家生产更多的粮食和工业原料，并成为今后国营农场事业继续前进的基地。据估计，现有农场如果能把产品成本平均降低百分之十，这笔资金就能建立五、六个拥有五万亩耕地的机械农场，可见现有农场的潜力是很大的。
    为了办好现有的国营机械农场，各场负责人员应该认真研究和坚决贯彻党中央和国务院关于厉行节约、克服浪费的号召，迅速制定相应的计划和措施，发动全场职工，检查本单位的各种浪费现象，挖掘潜力，堵塞漏洞。今年上半年，有些农场完成了生产财务计划，也有不少农场没有完成生产财务计划；若干农场执行计划的情况是不很好或是很不好的。目前正是农场完成全年增产节约计划的决定季节，业已完成上半年生产财务计划的农场应该继续努力，争取超额完成全年计划；没有完成上半年生产财务计划的农场，应该尽一切努力，在下半年生产中争取弥补上半年没有完成的部分。今年大部分地区的自然条件对我们完成计划是极为有利的；所有国营农场、牧场都应力争完成和超额完成全年的增产计划和上缴利润的计划。为此，各场应立即抓紧检查本场增产节约情况，作好春麦收获工作，加强秋前田间管理，以及中耕、除草、培土、晚秋播种等工作，并作好秋收准备，全面贯彻增产节约，为完成一九五五年生产财务计划而努力！
