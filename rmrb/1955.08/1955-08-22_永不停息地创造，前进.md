　　Ceaselessly Creating, Advancing
　　By Our Correspondent　Fu Dong
    The story of Huang Rongchang, a carpenter at the No. 1 Steel Plant of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, creating more than thirty machines from scrap materials in three years is widely told. But Huang Rongchang was not satisfied with these achievements. He and his partners continued to advance ceaselessly. In the past year alone, they have created another twenty-one machines from scrap materials. These machines are far more complex than the earlier ones. Some increase work efficiency dozens of times, and some increase work efficiency hundreds of times.
    In May 1954, Huang Rongchang returned to Chongqing after visiting the "Anshan Iron and Steel Technological Innovation Exhibition" in Beijing. As soon as he entered the door of the factory's carpentry workshop, he discovered a new problem. The carpentry workshop was filled with a pile of new wood transported from Tibet. This kind of wood was more than two zhang long and more than three chi thick. When sawing, eight people had to hold the machine beside it, and someone had to push the wood forward little by little. Once, the wood overturned the machine, almost killing someone. When sawing by hand, four people were exhausted, and they could only saw one line a day. Seeing everyone so tired, he felt very sad.
    What to do? He stared blankly at the double gantry crane. This machine was strong enough to saw seven or eight cun of wood, but it became discouraged when a large piece of wood was placed on it. This batch of work was particularly important. The wood was to be used for making steel ingot molds. If it wasn't completed on time, it would affect the plant's steel production.
    Could he assemble a machine for sawing thick wood using scrap materials? He pondered.
    He went to the comrades in the group and explained in detail what he had seen at the "Anshan Iron and Steel Technological Innovation Exhibition" about workers improving old machines. He said: We should learn from the spirit of thrift of workers from all over the country and assemble a new machine using existing scrap materials. Everyone agreed and decided to rush out this machine before "July 1st" as a gift to celebrate the Party's birthday.
    No sooner said than done, everyone immediately got to work.
    As soon as they got off work, they would drill into the scrap iron piles. They were as if possessed, still picking and choosing even when it was dark. When they saw a truck delivering scrap iron, they were as happy as if they had found a treasure. The summer sun in Chongqing was like fire, and the scrap iron was very hot. Some people's hands and faces were peeling from the sun, but they didn't seem to notice, turning things over and over, even forgetting to eat, and ignoring the rain.
    Sometimes, the parts were found, but they were not suitable. At night, Huang Rongchang would crawl into the carpentry workshop and file away. He would file all night long. When extremely tired, he would lie down on a work stool or workbench for a while.
    Just as they were getting excited, Huang Rongchang suddenly fell ill. He had chills and fever, and his whole body ached. He was sent to the hospital.
    In the hospital, the piles and piles of wood in the workshop still appeared in his mind. As soon as he felt a little better, he thought about the machine again. Thinking about it, one day a thought flashed into his mind: "The machine being assembled now only has one saw blade and can only produce one line of material at a time. Why not install two saw blades and saw two pieces of wood at the same time? Wouldn't that reduce the need to assemble another machine?" Once this thought arose, he couldn't let it go.
    He remembered when he visited the "Anshan Iron and Steel Technological Innovation Exhibition" in Beijing, Comrade Zhang Mingshan personally pointed to the model of the anti-encirclement plate and explained the creation process to him. It was so difficult! How many nights Zhang Mingshan didn't sleep, experimenting nervously. "No matter how difficult things are, our working class can overcome them." He kept hearing Zhang Mingshan's voice in his ears. He was full of confidence. So he pondered along that line. He sat up, took a piece of paper, and started drawing, drawing until midnight. Once his mind was opened, there were more ideas. Before long, he drew it out. He looked at his sketch and felt like flowers were blooming in his heart. He jumped out of bed and wanted to run back to the factory immediately. But when he walked out of the room, it was quiet all around, and there was not a soul in sight. When he looked at the clock again, it was pointing straight at one o'clock. Only then did he realize that everyone was asleep, so he had to return to the ward. That night, he didn't close his eyes. At dawn, he asked the nurse to tell the doctor that he wanted to return to the factory. The doctor refused to let him. But Huang Rongchang had to go. Finally, the doctor relented and found a nurse to take care of Huang Rongchang back to the factory.
    Huang Rongchang convened a meeting, attended by the Party branch secretary, the workshop director, and the chairman of the trade union.
    He explained the structure of the machine to everyone, and everyone discussed it: if this automatic double band saw machine with two saw blades was completed, only four people would be needed to operate it; while the two automatic single band saw machines currently being assembled would require sixteen people to work together, and an additional gantry crane walkway and a workbench would be needed.
    Everyone decided to assemble a new machine. The people in the carpentry workshop were as fascinated by the machine as Huang Rongchang was, and everyone twisted into a rope, working nervously like charging.
    The Party Committee Secretary was also very concerned, coming to the workshop from time to time to ask "what difficulties there were" and "what was needed." The factory director was the same, when he heard everyone say that the machine was still short of saw blades, he immediately approved a note to buy them.
    Xu Zhanyun, a veteran master from the machine shop, would come to the carpentry workshop to take a look whenever he had time. When it came to installing the machine and the motor, he would help everyone calculate: how many revolutions per minute the motor should have, how much the machine should rotate, how to install the fast parts of the machine, and how to install the slow parts.
    In less than a month, the machine was assembled. Now, when the wood is placed on a six-foot-long car, the car will automatically move along the gantry crane walkway. When the wood passes through an eight- or nine-foot-high machine, it will be sawn in half with a whirring sound in just one minute. Before long, a thick and old piece of wood will be turned into thin pieces of boards. The efficiency is increased by nine hundred and sixty times compared to manual operation.
    In October 1954, Huang Rongchang went to Beijing to attend the First Session of the First National People's Congress. He listened to Chairman Mao's opening speech and later visited the Soviet Exhibition Hall, which gave him great inspiration. After returning, he and his partners, using scrap materials, assembled an automatic double gantry crane, an automatic material handling machine, a four-sided planer, and so on.
    Previously, all the work in the carpentry workshop was manual. Every job had to be chopped with an axe and planed with a plane. The workers worked hard from morning till night, but they still couldn't finish the work, and some work had to be contracted out to factories. Since Huang Rongchang created many machines, the carpentry workshop has changed. Now, the machines can not only cut the wood into sections, but also plane the wood as smooth as a mirror. The workers are no longer as tired as before. Previously, when搬运二丈多长三尺多粗的木料时，要车间三十六个工人放下手里的活，拿着绳子杠子哈腰弯背地去抬，气力小点的常把腰给闪了，木料搬到车间还得用铁杠子摆弄到机器上，这样前前后后总要折腾一个钟头。搬运二丈多长三尺多粗的木料时，要车间三十六个工人放下手里的活，拿着绳子杠子哈腰弯背地去抬，气力小点的常把腰给闪了，木料搬到车间还得用铁杠子摆弄到机器上，这样前前后后总要折腾一个钟头. Whereas, now using the automatic material handling machine, it only takes one minute to automatically transport the material to the machine in the workshop, and the machine will automatically pour the material onto the machine.
    Huang Rongchang not only makes machines for his own workshop, but also helps the stonemasons, sawyers, and masons in the factory to make many machines.
    Previously, the workers in the quarry tied ropes around their waists and hung halfway up the mountain to drill blasting holes with hammers. The large stones that were blasted down had to be hammered into smaller pieces by the large hammer workers using hammers weighing more than thirty jin. Then, the smaller hammer workers would hammer them into qualified gravel. The sun was scorching, and it was difficult for the workers to even drink water. It was eight hundred meters uphill to carry a load of water from the river to the mountain. At night, there were no electric lights, and the workers lit wicks in ink bottles.
    After Huang Rongchang mobilized veteran technicians and young workers to use scrap materials to make many machines for them, the cannon workers now have pneumatic drills; the large hammer workers easily use stone crushers to break stones; when people are thirsty, they can turn on the tap and have cool tap water delivered. At night, electric lights shine brightly all over the mountain.
    People's hands were freed up, and many carpenters and sawyers were transferred to other workshops to work, and many were transferred to Tibet to participate in construction.
    During the Second Session of the National People's Congress in Beijing, Huang Rongchang introduced his and his partners' work for the year to reporters. He took out a letter and a table of their group's production increase and conservation plan for the second half of the year. The letter read:
      "Dear Comrade Huang Rongchang... Regarding your question about the planer... it has been installed. The test run results are all normal, and it is as clever as we imagined.
    There is also a message to tell you that the production increase and conservation campaign this year has been launched in our factory. Under the call of the Party and the trade union, all the employees of the factory have actively launched a competition. Our department (referring to the carpentry workshop) has been allocated an amount of 20,000 yuan. The original allocation for the group was 400 yuan. After careful discussion and detailed accounting, it has exceeded 15,000 yuan..."
    Huang Rongchang said excitedly: "Our workers are like this, never tired, always moving forward. Everyone believes that there is no end to labor creation. In the second half of the year, we plan to assemble a shaper, a band saw automatic grinder using scrap materials, and overhaul and modify seven other machines." His black eyes were shining, unable to suppress the joy in his heart, and he said happily: "Work is difficult, but it is happy!"
    He has full confidence in the scheduled completion of the Five-Year Plan. He said: "Our Five-Year Plan can definitely be completed on schedule! It can definitely be completed ahead of schedule and with overfulfillment!"
    Yes, our Five-Year Plan can definitely be completed! It can definitely be completed ahead of schedule and with overfulfillment! Because our country has such workers: they not only have the will of steel, they also have rich wisdom and unlimited enthusiasm and sense of responsibility for the socialist cause. They are the guarantee for us to complete the Five-Year Plan!

　　永不停息地创造，前进
　　本报记者　傅冬
    重庆钢铁公司第一钢铁厂木工黄荣昌，在三年的时间里，用废器材创造了三十多部机器的事迹，到处被人传颂着。但是黄荣昌并没有满足于这些成就，他同伙伴们毫不停息地前进，最近一年，他们又用废器材创造了二十一部机器。这些机器比早先创造的机器复杂得多，有的提高工作效率几十倍，有的提高工作效率几百倍。
    一九五四年五月，黄荣昌从北京参观了“鞍钢技术革新展览会”回到重庆。一进工厂木工房的门，他就发现了个新问题。木工房摆着一堆新从西藏运来的木料。这种木料有二丈多长，三尺多粗。锯的时候，旁边要八个人按住机器，还得有人一点一点往前推木头。有一次木头把机器压翻了，险些打死人。用人工锯，四个人弄得腰酸腿痛，一天才能锯一线。看到大伙那样劳累，他很难过。
    怎么办呢？他瞅着双行车直发楞。这机器锯七、八寸的木头挺得劲，可是放上块大木料就这么泄气。这批活又特别重要，木料锯出来，是作钢锭木圈用的，赶不出来，就要影响厂里的炼钢生产。
    能不能用废器材装一部锯粗木头的机器？他寻思着。
    他去找小组的同志，把他在“鞍钢技术革新展览会”看到的工人改进旧机器的事向大伙详细讲了。他说：咱们应该学习各地工人同志们的节约精神，用现成的废料装一部新机器。大伙都赞成，决定在“七一”前赶出这部机器，作为送给党的生日的礼物。
    说干就干，大伙马上就动起手来了。
    一下班，大伙就往废铁堆里钻。他们像着了迷一样，天黑了，还在那里挑东拣西。一见送废铁的汽车来了，他们就像看见什么珍宝似地高兴。重庆夏天的太阳像火一样，废铁非常烫手，有的人手上、脸上被晒得脱了皮，但他们就好像没有感觉到一样，翻来翻去，甚至连饭也忘了吃，下起雨来也不理会。
    有时，零件找到了，但不合适。夜里，黄荣昌钻到木工房里吭嗤吭嗤地锉。一锉就是一个整夜。累极了，他就躺在工凳或工作台上歇一会。
    正搞得起劲，黄荣昌忽然病倒了。他一阵发冷，一阵发热，浑身疼痛。他被送到了医院。
    在医院里，他的脑海里仍然出现了车间那一大堆一大堆的木料。身上稍为好过一点，他就又想起机器的事来。想着想着，有一天他脑子里闪起一个念头：“现在装配的机器只有一根锯条，一次只能出一线料，为什么不装两根锯条，同时锯两根木头呢？那样不是可以少装一部机器？”这念头一起，就放不下了。
    他想起在北京参观“鞍钢技术革新展览会”时，张明山同志亲自指着反围盘的模型给他介绍创作过程时的情景。那多么艰难呀！有多少夜张明山没有睡觉，紧张地试验。“再困难的事，咱们工人阶级也能克服。”他耳朵里一直响着张明山的声音。他充满了信心。于是他就顺着那个道儿琢磨。他坐起来，拿张纸来画，一画画到半夜。心里一开窍，道儿就多了。没多久，他就画出来了。他看看自己画的草图，心里就像开了花一样。他跳下床来，想马上跑回厂里去。可是他走出房门一看，四周静悄悄的，连个人影儿也没有。再一看钟，端端正正指着一点，这时才发觉所有的人都睡了，他只好回到病房去。那一夜，他没有合眼。天一亮，他就请护士告诉医生说他要回厂。医生说什么也不肯。但黄荣昌非走不可。最后医生让步了，他找了位护士照护黄荣昌回厂。
    黄荣昌召开了个会，党支部书记、车间主任、工会主席都出席了。
    他把机器的构造讲给大伙听，大家合计了一下：这部装有两根锯条的自动双带锯机搞成了，只要四个人掌握；而目前正在装配的那两部自动单带锯机却要十六个人一起忙，另外还得多作一个行车走道，一个工作台。
    大家决定装一部新机器。木工房的人对机器的事也像黄荣昌一样着迷，大伙扭成一股劲，像打冲锋似的紧张地干。
    党委书记也非常关心，不时到车间来问“有什么困难”，“需要什么东西”。厂长也是这样，他听大家说机器还缺锯条，马上就批条子去买。
    机工车间的老师傅徐占云得空就来木工房瞅瞅。挨到装机器、马达的时候，他就帮大伙算计：马达一分钟该多少转，机器应转多少，机器速度快的地方怎么个装法，慢的地方又怎么个装法。
    没一个月，机器装好了。现在把木料放在一个六尺长的车上时，车子就会自动沿着行车走道走动。当木料经过一个八、九尺高的机器时，就哗哗地锯成两半，时间只要一分钟。用不了多大一会功夫，一根老粗老粗的木头就变成薄薄的一块一块的板子了。效率比手工操作提高了九百六十倍。
    一九五四年十月黄荣昌到北京参加第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议。他听了毛主席的开幕词，以后又参观了苏联展览馆，得到了很大的启发。回去，他同他的伙伴一起，又用废料装配了自动双行车、自动运料机、四方刨木机等。
    早先木工房的活全都是手工活，样样活都得一斧头一斧头地砍，一刨子一刨子地推。工人整天起早摸黑地干，活还是做不过来，有些活不得不包给厂外去做。自从黄荣昌创造了许多机器，木工房就改样了。现在机器不但能把木头切成一截一截的，而且可以把木头刨得像镜面一样光滑。工人也再不像以前那样劳累了。原先搬运二丈多长三尺多粗的木料时，要车间三十六个工人放下手里的活，拿着绳子杠子哈腰弯背地去抬，气力小点的常把腰给闪了，木料搬到车间还得用铁杠子摆弄到机器上，这样前前后后总要折腾一个钟头。而现在用自动运料机，只要一分钟就能自动把料运到车间的机器旁，机器还会自动把料倒在机器上。
    黄荣昌不光给自己车间造机器，还帮厂里的石工、解工、泥工造了好些机器。
    先前，采石场的工人腰里绑根绳子，吊在半山腰里一捶一捶地打炮眼。爆下来的大石头，要大捶工用三十多斤重的榔头一点一点打成较小的石块。然后再由小捶工捶成合格的碎石。太阳烤人，工人连水也很难喝上。从河边往山上挑一担水得爬八百公尺远的高坡。晚上没有电灯，工人在墨水瓶里放根灯心草点亮。
    黄荣昌发动老技术工人和青年工人用废料给他们造了不少机器以后，现在炮工的手里有了风钻；大捶工轻松地用破石机敲打石头；人们口渴了，只要一扭水龙头，就有清凉的自来水送来。夜里，满山头的电灯明晃晃地照耀着。
    人手腾出来了，很多木工、解工调到别的车间去工作，有不少调往西藏去参加建设。
    黄荣昌在北京参加全国人民代表大会第二次会议期间，他给记者介绍了他和他的伙伴们一年的工作。他拿出一封信和一张他们小组下半年的增产节约计划表。信上这样写道：
      “亲爱的黄荣昌同志……关于您问刨木机一事……已经安装好了。试车结果，全部正常，完全像我们所想像的那样灵巧。
    还有个消息告诉您，今年的增产节约运动，我们厂里已开展起来了。全厂职工在党和工会的号召下，都积极展开了竞赛。我科里（指木工房）分配金额两万元，组里原分配额为四百元，经过大家细致的讨论和算细账，超额为一万五千多元……”
    黄荣昌兴奋地说：“我们工人就是这样，永不疲倦，永远向前。大伙都认为劳动创造是没有尽头的。下半年我们打算用废料装一部牛头刨床机、一部带锯自动砂轮机，检修和改装七部其他的机器。”他的黑眼睛里发着光，无法抑制心头的喜悦，高兴地说：“工作困难，可是快乐！”
    他对五年计划的如期完成抱有充分的信心。他说：“我们的五年计划一定可以如期完成！一定可以超额和提前完成！”
    是的，我们的五年计划是一定可以完成的！是一定可以超额和提前完成的！因为我们的国家有这样的工人：他们不但有钢铁的意志，他们还有丰富的智慧和对社会主义事业的无限热情和责任心。他们就是我们完成五年计划的保证！
