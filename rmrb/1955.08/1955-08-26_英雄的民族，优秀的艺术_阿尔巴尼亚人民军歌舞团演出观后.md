　　A Heroic People, Excellent Art
　　——After Seeing the Performance of the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble
　　Vice Secretary-General of the Chinese Musicians Association　Meng Bo
    The Albanian people have a glorious revolutionary tradition. For many years, the Albanian people have waged countless heroic and tenacious struggles to resist the reactionary ruling class of their own country and foreign invaders, and have produced national heroes such as Skanderbeg who are worthy of respect. During the Second World War, the heroic Albanian people, under the leadership of the Labor Party and with the help of the Soviet Union, finally won true independence and freedom.
    Today, as we welcome the envoys of culture and friendship from this heroic country, and as we appreciate the wonderful performances of the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble, we feel immense excitement and joy in our hearts. The people of China and Albania both have experienced the pain of being invaded and oppressed in the past, and today they are fighting for a common goal. Therefore, many of the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble's programs, which are rich in national characteristics and have a high degree of artistry and combativeness, are so exciting to us.
    The examples of some famous Albanian composers actively reflecting the revolutionary struggle through musical art are very worthy of Chinese music workers to learn from. For example, "March of the First Division" composed by Dora Leka describes the heroic battle of the First Division of the Albanian People's Army charging the fascist invaders. The last section of the march is:
    "Charge! Charge! Charge towards the raging fire!
    Everywhere, the flags of freedom are rising,
    Bringing light to the motherland,
    Opening the way for the heroic people."
    The composer used majestic melodies and clear rhythms to portray the invincible heroic spirit of the First Division of the Albanian People's Army. The whole piece is majestic, strong, and full of optimism.
    "Song of Hero Asim Zeneli" composed by Klanqi depicts the heroic Asim Zeneli and his team, who are engaged in a fierce battle with the Italian fascist army, which is superior in strength. The hero sacrificed heroically in the battle, but the battle finally won, and the Italian fascist army paid a large number of casualties. The music begins with a slow board. When the band plays a slow and deep melody, it immediately arouses people's infinite admiration and remembrance for the hero. Then, the glorious achievements of the hero in the revolutionary struggle are narrated in the form of a combination of solo and chorus. In the final part of the music, the composer uses simple and powerful melodies and short and powerful rhythms to very successfully express the people's extremely excited mood after the victory to swear and resolve to avenge the dead hero and the blood shed by the Albanian people.
    "Song of the Enver Hoxha Hydropower Station" composed by Jakova powerfully reflects and praises the moving scenes of the Albanian people building their motherland with heroic labor under the leadership of the Labor Party and Albanian people's leader Enver Hoxha after liberation. In the processing of the music, the composer used the contrast of rhythm, which not only makes the music full of changes, but also prominently expresses the Albanian people's happy, joyful emotions and inexhaustible strength in the cause of building the motherland.
    These musical works with strong national characteristics and high artistic and combat effectiveness, under the outstanding command of Gajo Avrazi of the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble, and through the singing of the choir's outstanding vocal artists, very successfully demonstrated the patriotism and revolutionary heroism of the Albanian people during the war and in the post-war construction. These works will undoubtedly inspire the Chinese people who are building socialism.
    The entire performance of the music program also contains eight very beautiful Albanian folk songs. Such as "Tell me! Tell me!", "You are like a flower about to bloom", "Is there water in the spring here", etc., all sing and describe the pure love of young men and women and their pursuit of a happy life with simple, healthy, humorous, and optimistic feelings. These folk songs are not only diverse in form, but also have the characteristics of simple structure, beautiful melody, and rich rhythm changes, so each folk song can deeply touch the hearts of the audience. From here we can see how rich and colorful Albanian folk art is.
    The Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble also sang some selections from classical operas. The male chorus "Gloria" (selection from the opera "Ivan Susanin") and the selection from the opera "The Marriage of Figaro" soloed by Afni Mulia left a particularly deep impression on the audience due to the performers' high vocal skills and rich expressions.
    The Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble's choir and soloists sang many Chinese songs in the evening, especially the choir's "The East is Red" and "People of the World Are of One Heart", the pronunciation was so clear and the expression was so sincere, fully demonstrating the Albanian people's deep friendship with the Chinese people.
    The visit and performance of the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble to our country has allowed us to see the excellent and militant art of the Albanian people, and also made us further understand the lives and struggles of the people in the fraternal country on the distant Adriatic coast. This will undoubtedly promote cultural exchanges between China and Albania and consolidate the profound friendship between the people of the two countries.

　　英雄的民族，优秀的艺术
　　——阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团演出观后
　　中国音乐家协会副秘书长　孟波
    阿尔巴尼亚人民具有光荣的革命传统。多少年来，阿尔巴尼亚人民为了反抗本国的反动统治阶级和外国侵略者，作过无数次英勇、顽强的斗争，并产生过像斯坎德倍格这样令人崇敬的民族英雄。在第二次世界大战中，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，终于在劳动党的领导和苏联的帮助下，获得了真正的独立和自由。
    今天，当我们欢迎来自这一个英雄的国家的文化和友谊的使节的时候，当我们欣赏阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团的精采的演出的时候，内心真是感到莫大的兴奋和愉快。中阿两国人民过去都有过被侵略、被压迫的痛苦的经历，今天又都在为着一个共同的目标奋斗，所以阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团演出的许多富有民族色彩和有着高度艺术性与战斗性的节目，是那样地激动着我们。
    阿尔巴尼亚的一些著名作曲家运用音乐艺术积极地反映革命斗争的范例，是非常值得中国音乐工作者学习的。例如多拉·列卡作曲的“第一师进行曲”，是描写阿尔巴尼亚人民军第一师冲击法西斯侵略者的英勇战斗的。进行曲的最后一段是：
    “冲击！冲击！冲向弥漫的战火！
    到处，自由的旗帜在升起，
    给祖国带来光明，
    给英雄的人民开辟道路。”
    作曲者以雄伟的旋律和鲜明的节奏刻划出阿尔巴尼亚人民军第一师所向无敌的英雄气概。整个乐曲雄伟健壮、充满着乐观主义的情绪。
    克兰其亚作曲的“英雄阿西姆·赛乃列之歌”，描写的是英雄阿西姆·赛乃列和他的队伍，在同兵力悬殊的意大利法西斯军队进行着剧烈的战斗，英雄在战斗中壮烈地牺牲了，但战斗终于取得了胜利，意大利法西斯军队付出了大量的伤亡。乐曲以慢板开始，当乐队奏出缓慢而又深沉的旋律的时候，立即引起人们对英雄的无限的崇敬和怀念。接着以领唱同合唱结合的形式来叙述英雄在革命战斗中的光辉业迹。乐曲的最后部分，作曲者以朴实雄健的旋律和短促有力的节奏，非常成功地表现了人们在胜利后以异常激动的心情来宣誓、决心要为死去的英雄、为阿尔巴尼亚人民所流的鲜血报仇。
    亚柯瓦作曲的“恩维尔·霍查水电站之歌”，有力地反映和歌颂了解放后阿尔巴尼亚人民在劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民领袖恩维尔·霍查领导下，以英勇的劳动来建设自己的祖国的动人的情景。作曲者在乐曲处理上运用了节奏的对比，不仅使乐曲富于变化，而且突出地表现了阿尔巴尼亚人民在建设祖国的事业中的愉快、欢乐的情绪和无穷尽的力量。
    这些具有浓厚的民族色彩和高度艺术性、战斗性的音乐作品，在阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团加乔·阿夫拉齐的杰出的指挥下，经过合唱队卓越的声乐艺术家的演唱，非常成功地表现了阿尔巴尼亚人民在战争时期和战后建设中的爱国主义和革命英雄主义。这些作品，无疑地会鼓舞正在建设社会主义的中国人民。
    在整个演出的音乐节目中，还包含着八首非常优美的阿尔巴尼亚民歌。如“说吧！说吧！”、“你像一枝含苞欲放的花朵”、“这里的泉井有没有水”等，都以朴素、健康、诙谐、乐观的感情，歌颂和描写了青年男女纯洁的爱情和他们对于幸福生活的追求。这些民歌不仅形式多样，而且都具备着结构朴实、旋律优美、节奏富于变化等特点，所以每一首民歌都能深深地打动听众的心。从这里我们可以看到阿尔巴尼亚的民间艺术是多么丰富多采。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团还演唱了一些古典歌剧的选曲，男声合唱的“光荣颂”（歌剧“伊凡·苏萨宁”选曲）和阿夫尼·穆利亚独唱的歌剧“费加罗的婚礼”选曲，由于演唱者的高度声乐技巧和丰富的表情，给观众留下特别深刻的印象。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团的合唱队和独唱家，在晚会中所演唱的许多中国歌曲，特别是合唱队演唱的“东方红”和“全世界人民心一条”，吐字是那样的清楚，表情是那样的真挚，充分说明了阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民的深厚的友谊。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团到我国的访问和演出，使我们亲切地看到了阿尔巴尼亚人民的优秀的富有战斗性的艺术，也使我们进一步了解了在遥远的、亚得里亚海畔的兄弟国家的人民的生活和斗争。这无疑地会促进中阿两国的文化交流和巩固两国人民之间的深厚友谊。
