The Advancing Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture
Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture Tuanjie Bao Editorial Department

Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture is a beautiful place with rich resources. It includes ten counties: Longshan, Sangzhi, Yongshun, Dayong, Huayuan, Fenghuang, Jishou, Guzhang, Baojing, and Luxi, covering an area of more than 19,000 square kilometers, with a population of nearly 1.6 million, of which more than 310,000 are Miao people. Within this region, it produces the nationally renowned tung oil, Chinese gallnuts, and abundant timber. In the mountains of the Wuling mountain range, there are reserves of sulfur, iron, coal, lead, and other minerals. Local specialties are even more abundant; according to incomplete surveys, there are more than 150 kinds of giant salamanders, cork, eucommia, and various medicinal materials.

In August 1952, the Miao people of Xiangxi realized their right to be masters of their own affairs and implemented regional autonomy. In the past, there was a Miao proverb:
“We only see pots cooking rice, never Miao people becoming officials.” Now, the governor of the autonomous prefecture, Shi Bangzhi, and the deputy governor, Long Zaiyu, are both Miao, and the members of the prefectural people's committee are also mainly Miao. Many of the responsible staff members of the bureaus and sections directly under the autonomous prefecture are also Miao. In the past few years, local Party organizations and governments have trained more than 980 Miao staff members (not including township staff) and recruited more than 1,790 outstanding Miao people to join the Communist Party in Miao villages. Now, the power organs established in Miao-populated areas have basically achieved nationalization. In the six Miao-populated or mixed-population counties of Huayuan, Fenghuang, Guzhang, Jishou, Luxi, and Baojing, Miao people serve as county heads or deputy county heads, and even more Miao people hold the position of district head. Currently, there are 157 Miao staff members above the deputy district head and district head level. The people's committees of Miao-populated townships are almost entirely staffed by Miao people.

Before liberation, this remote mountainous area had no industry at all. In the few years since liberation, nearly forty local state-owned factories and mines have been established, including power generation, mining, oil production, agricultural tool manufacturing, papermaking, umbrella making, rice milling, printing, etc., employing a total of seven or eight hundred workers, and have begun to train some Miao skilled workers. In the past, there was not a single electric light here. Now, night markets have appeared in every county town and several larger market towns. In order to change the inconvenient transportation situation in the mountainous areas, the Yong (shun) - Bao (jing) and Yong (shun) - Da (yong) highways have been newly built, totaling more than 130 kilometers in length. The Da Ci (from Dayong to Cili in the neighboring area) highway is also under construction. There are more than 310 kilometers of navigable waterways in the autonomous prefecture. Last year, the Hunan Provincial Navigation Administration also opened the Chang-Chen steamship route, and small steamships can directly reach Luxi, the gateway to the autonomous prefecture. According to last year's statistics, the volume of industrial and agricultural products transported by automobiles and wooden boats reached 80,000 tons.

More than 90% of the population of the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture depends on agriculture for a living. Now, agricultural production and mutual aid cooperative organizations have developed greatly. There are 376 agricultural production cooperatives and more than 36,000 mutual aid teams in the prefecture, and the number of farmer households participating in mutual aid cooperative organizations accounts for more than 63% of the total number of farmer households. In addition, more than 660 credit cooperatives have been established, and the number of farmer households joining the cooperatives accounts for more than 40% of the total number of farmer households. In Baiyan Township, Huayuan County, a Miao-populated area, there are only six individual farmers left, excluding landlords, rich peasants, and controlled elements. With the development of mutual aid cooperative organizations, coupled with the vigorous assistance of the people's government, the agricultural production of the autonomous prefecture has been increasing year by year. For example, taking 1952 as 100, it was 118.6 in 1954. In 1951, it was still necessary to transport a large amount of grain from outside the area. Since 1952, it has been able to be self-sufficient and have surplus grain for export. From 1952 to 1954, the surplus grain sold by farmers of all ethnic groups was equivalent to more than 286 million jin of rice. From September 1954 to June this year, the autonomous prefecture transferred more than 84 million jin of grain to support the management of Dongting Lake and the disaster victims in the Dongting Lake area. The development of agricultural production is inseparable from the help of the people's government. In the past few years, the people's government has issued large amounts of loans and various relief funds to help farmers develop production. In 1954 alone, the government issued a total of more than 3.3 million yuan in various relief funds, preferential treatment funds, agricultural loans, credit loans, and water conservancy investment. In the past, Miao farmers were very backward in production due to poverty, and some mountainous areas still retained the primitive production method of "slash-and-burn cultivation." Now, most Miao farmers use a full set of iron farm tools, changing the previous habit of "extensive cultivation." The sowing time is generally ten days to half a month earlier than before liberation. Trade companies have been established in each county of the autonomous prefecture, and some counties have also established other commercial professional companies. Supply and marketing cooperatives have been established in each district, and supply and marketing cooperative branches or distribution stores have been established in most townships. The state-owned trade sector alone invested more than 15 million yuan in the purchase of local specialties from 1950 to August 1954. Many primary markets are also becoming more and more prosperous. For example, Jishou Town was originally just a small town with a population of more than 6,000, but since becoming the capital of the autonomous prefecture, the population has increased to more than 15,000. In the Miao area market town of Mali Field, more than 10,000 people attend each market day, and the turnover per market day is more than 5,000 yuan.

At present, there are 14 secondary schools in the autonomous prefecture, including two ethnic normal schools and one ethnic middle school, with more than 7,600 middle school students. There are more than 1,690 primary schools in the prefecture, with more than 133,000 primary school students, of which more than 27,000 are Miao middle and primary school students. Each county in the prefecture has established a relatively well-equipped cultural center, and 12 district cultural stations have also been established as key points. Rural clubs have also been established as key points in the townships. In addition to two cinemas, there are also six film projection teams in the prefecture. Mass cultural and entertainment organizations have also developed vigorously. There are 218 rural amateur theater troupes, 3 puppet theater troupes, 72 amateur song and dance teams, and many Miao folk song teams in the prefecture. The Miao language theater troupe in Mali Field performed the ethnic drama "Unity Destroys Demons" in the Miao language for the first time last year.

The development of medical and health undertakings in the autonomous prefecture has greatly improved the health of the people of all ethnic groups. At present, there are two well-equipped hospitals, ten health centers, and seventy-four health stations in the prefecture. There is also an antimalarial station and four leprosy management villages, specializing in the prevention and treatment of local infectious diseases. In addition, 129 midwifery stations have been established, and more than 300 new-style midwives have been trained. In many townships, 80% to 90% of infants are delivered using the new method, and the infant mortality rate has been greatly reduced. Before liberation, the infant mortality rate in some townships in Jishou County reached 70%. In January 1954, it had dropped to only 5% of the total number of infants born.

Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and under the brilliant light of the Party's ethnic policy, the people of all ethnic groups in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture are advancing by leaps and bounds. (Attached picture)

　　前进中的湘西苗族自治州
　　湘西苗族自治州团结报编辑部
    湘西苗族自治州是个山川秀丽、物产丰富的好地方。它包括龙山、桑植、永顺、大庸、花垣、凤凰、吉首、古丈、保靖、泸溪十个县，面积有一万九千多平方公里，人口近一百六十万，其中苗族人口有三十一万多。在这个区域内，出产有全国闻名的桐油、五棓子和丰富的木材；在武陵山脉余脉的崇山峻岭中，蕴藏着硫磺、铁、煤、铅等各种矿藏；土特产更是丰富，据不完全调查，有娃娃鱼、栓皮、杜仲及各种药材共一百五十种以上。
    一九五二年八月，湘西苗族人民实现了当家作主的权利，实行了区域自治。过去苗家有句谚语：
  “只见鼎罐煮饭，哪见苗家做官。”现在自治州州长石邦智，副州长龙再宇都是苗族，州人民委员会的组成人员也以苗族为主，自治州直辖的很多局科的负责工作人员也是苗族。几年来，当地党组织和政府培养了苗族工作人员九百八十多人（不包括乡工作人员），在苗族农村吸收了一千七百九十多苗族优秀分子参加共产党。现在在苗族聚居地区建立的政权机关，已基本上做到了民族化。在花垣、凤凰、古丈、吉首、泸溪、保靖六个苗族聚居县或杂居县，都有苗族人担任县长或副县长，担任区长职务的苗族人就更多了。现在副区长、区长级以上的苗族工作人员有一百五十七人。在苗族聚居乡的乡人民委员会中差不多全是苗族工作人员。
    解放前，这个闭塞的山区根本没有工业，在解放后几年中，已陆续创办了地方国营厂矿企业近四十个，包括发电、采矿、制油、制农具、造纸、制伞、碾米、印刷等，共有职工七、八百人，并且开始培养了一些苗族技术工人。过去这里没有一盏电灯，现在每个县城和几个较大集镇已出现了夜市。为了改变山区交通不便的状况，新修了永（顺）保（靖）、永（顺）大（庸）公路，共长一百三十多公里，大慈（从大庸到邻区慈利）公路也正在修筑。自治州中已通木船的河道共有三百一十多公里，去年，湖南省航运管理局还开辟了常辰线火轮航线，小火轮可直达自治州的门户泸溪了。据去年的统计，汽车、木船完成的工农业产品运输量共达八万吨。
    湘西苗族自治州百分之九十以上的人口靠农业为生，现在农业生产和互助合作组织已有很大的发展。全州共有三百七十六个农业生产合作社，三万六千多个互助组，参加互助合作组织的农户占总农户百分之六十三以上；另外还建立了六百六十多个信用合作社，入社农户占总农户百分之四十以上。在苗族聚居的花垣县白岩乡，除地主、富农、管制分子外，只有六户个体农民了。随着互助合作组织的发展，加上人民政府的大力援助，自治州的农业生产在逐年提高，如以一九五二年为一百，一九五四年便为一百一十八点六。一九五一年还要从外区运进大批粮食，从一九五二年起，便能自给自足并有余粮外运了。从一九五二年到一九五四年，各族农民卖出的余粮折合稻谷二亿八千六百多万斤。从一九五四年九月到今年六月，自治州外调支援治理洞庭湖和洞庭湖区灾民的粮食就有八千四百多万斤。农业生产的发展是同人民政府的帮助分不开的。几年来，人民政府发放了大批的贷款和各项救济款扶助农民发展生产。光是一九五四年，政府发放的各项救济款、优抚款、农贷、信贷和水利投资共达三百三十多万元。苗族农民过去因生活贫困，生产很落后，有些山区还保留着“刀耕火种”的原始生产方式；现在苗族农民大都使用了全套的铁制农具，改变了以前“耕作粗放”的习惯。下种时间一般都比解放前提早了十天到半月。自治州各县都设有贸易公司，有的县还设立了其他商业专业公司，各区都建立了供销合作社，大部分的乡还建立了供销社分社或分销店。光是国营贸易部门，从一九五○年到一九五四年八月，收购土特产投放的资金就达一千五百万元以上。很多初级市场也一天天繁荣起来。像吉首镇原只是一个六千多人口的小镇，自成为自治州的首府后，人口已增加到一万五千人以上。苗区墟场麻栗场，每场赶场的人都在一万人以上，每场营业额在五千元以上。
    现在全自治州共有中等学校十四所，其中有两所民族师范和一所民族中学，共有中学生七千六百多人；全州小学共有一千六百九十多所，有小学生十三万三千多人，其中苗族中、小学生有二万七千多人。全州各县都建立了设备比较完善的文化馆，还重点建立了十二个区文化站，在乡里也重点建立了农村俱乐部。全州除有两座电影院外，还有六个电影放映队。群众的文化娱乐组织更是蓬勃地发展起来，全州有农村业余剧团二百一十八个，木偶剧团三个，业余歌舞队七十二个，还有许多苗族山歌队。麻栗场有个苗语剧团，去年还第一次用苗语演出了本民族的戏剧——“团结灭妖”。
    自治州医疗卫生事业的发展，使各族人民的健康状况大大改进。现在，全州有两所设备较完善的医院、十个卫生院和七十四个卫生所。还设有一所防疟站和四处麻疯管理村，专门防治地方性的传染病。另外，还建立了一百二十九个接生站，训练了新法接生员三百多人，很多乡用新法接生的婴儿达到出生婴儿的百分之八十到九十，婴儿死亡率大大降低。解放前，吉首县有的乡婴儿死亡率达到百分之七十，一九五四年一月已降低到只占生殖婴儿总数的百分之五了。
    在共产党的正确领导下，在党的民族政策光辉照耀下，湘西苗族自治州各族人民正大踏步地前进。（附图片）
