Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 8th: The eight mango saplings presented to the Chinese government by Indian Prime Minister Nehru have now sprouted fresh, tender leaves.

These mango trees were brought by Mr. Chand, the head of the Indian cultural delegation.

These eight mango trees were originally tropical fruits, encompassing four of the best varieties of Indian mango trees: "Alphonso," "Langar," "Shama-Bahisht-Chausa," and "Dashehari."

Two months ago, these mango trees were planted in the specimen botanical garden of Yuexiu Park on Yuexiu Mountain in Guangzhou. The planting workers treasured these gifts from a neighboring country, placing them under an awning with wisteria and begonias for special cultivation.

The mango saplings are growing in soil mixed from China and India, and have now sprouted their first branches and leaves on Chinese soil.

    印度赠送的芒果树长出嫩叶
    新华社广州八日电　印度尼赫鲁总理赠给中国政府的八棵芒果树苗，现在已吐出鲜嫩的叶子。
    这些芒果树是由印度文化代表团团长钱达先生带来的。
    这八棵芒果树原是热带的水果，包括了印度芒果树的四个最好的品种：“阿尔凡素”、“兰格拉”、“沙马·巴希斯特·乔沙”和“达希哈莉”。
    两个月前，这些芒果树种植在广州市越秀山的越秀公园标本植物园里，植树工人很珍贵这些来自邻邦的礼物，把它放置在长有紫藤和秋海棠的荫棚下加意培育。
    芒果树苗生长在混合着中国和印度的土壤里，现在已经在中国的土地上长出了第一批枝叶。
