Every Collective Mess Unit Must Conserve Grain

    Our Cafeteria Implements the "Raw Rice Steaming Method"

    I am the administrative worker at Shanghai Chengzhong High School. At the end of March, we heard that Changzhou Normal School was learning the "Raw Rice Steaming Method" from Chongqing Sichuan University to cook rice, which could save a lot of grain. With the support of the school's Party organization and administrative leadership, in early April, we sent comrades from the food service to Changzhou for on-site visits and study. After returning to the school, we experimented and promoted it.
    Before the experiment, we publicized it to the students in advance, explaining that we would try a steaming method that would save grain and taste good. However, because we had no experience, it might produce undercooked rice or make everyone eat overcooked rice. At the same time, we repeatedly persuaded the cooks to realize that saving one grain of rice would increase the strength for the country to realize socialist industrialization and support the liberation of Taiwan. We also introduced advanced experiences, analyzed the conditions of our school, and criticized incorrect views. Because everyone had a certain understanding of saving grain, many students and cooks expressed their support for this work. So, we started experimenting in the student cafeteria. After three days, some students asked us: Since steaming rice can save grain, why don't we eat steamed rice? In fact, they had already eaten steamed rice for three days without knowing it. This shows that our experiment was successful. We promoted the "Raw Rice Steaming Method" throughout the school on May 7th.
      The "Raw Rice Steaming Method" can be roughly divided into three steps:
    1.  Put the pre-washed rice into a wooden steaming bucket and steam it in a pot for about 30 minutes (or calculate 15 minutes after the steam comes up; the length of time depends on the amount of rice; here, 150 catties of rice is used as the standard for calculation). This step mainly steams the raw rice to heat it, causing the rice to crack, making it easier to fully absorb water in the second step. The weight of the rice steamed in this way increases by about 15% compared to the original raw rice because it absorbs steam and some of the moisture from washing the rice.
    2.  Pour the steamed rice into a wooden燜 (mèn - braising or stewing) bucket and add boiling water (it must be boiling water, and the action must be fast to prevent heat loss). After adding water, stir it once with a spatula, cover the wooden lid, and焖 (mèn) for 15 to 20 minutes. The pressure inside the bucket is small, so the water can be fully absorbed, and the rice can expand fully. After this焖 (mèn), the rice has initially formed. The softness or hardness of the rice depends entirely on the amount of water added. General water addition standard: one catty of Indica rice can add 1.12 to 2 catties; one catty of Japonica rice can add 1.5 to 1.10 catties. For example, if 100 catties of Indica rice becomes 115 catties after steaming, and then 185 catties of water are added to焖 (mèn) it, the rice will be neither soft nor hard.
    3.  Although the rice in the焖 (mèn) bucket is basically cooked, there are still some undercooked rice around the bucket and at the top and bottom of the bucket; although the rice in the middle is cooked, it has not fully absorbed water. Therefore, the rice in the焖 (mèn) bucket must be put back into the steaming bucket for a second steaming. This time, it generally steams for about 5 minutes after the steam comes up, and then it becomes soft and evenly cooked rice. The entire operation process of a pot of rice takes about 80 to 90 minutes.
    According to our school's trial results, the old method of cooking rice yields about 2.6 liang of cooked rice per catty of Indica rice, and about 2.3 liang per catty of Japonica rice; after switching to the "Raw Rice Steaming Method," each catty of Indica rice can yield 2.14 to 3 liang of steamed rice, and the Indica rice with the best expansion can be steamed to more than 3.6 liang, and each catty of Japonica rice can steam to 2.10 liang. The new method increases the weight of the cooked rice by about 20% to 21% and the volume by 15%, which means saving 15% of the grain. According to the school's grain consumption situation, the old method of cooking rice requires about 550 catties of rice per day. After switching to steaming rice, only 470 catties of rice are used per day, saving more than 80 catties of grain per day; calculated at 26 days per month (no meals on Sundays), more than 2,000 catties of grain can be saved.
    The equipment for this steaming method is also very simple and can be fully utilized with the existing equipment. No matter what style or fuel is used for the stove, it can be used, only one wooden steaming bucket, 焖 (mèn) bucket, and white iron pad need to be added.
    We also encountered various ideological obstacles when promoting the "Raw Rice Steaming Method." Some people felt: "Our leftover rice, porridge, and pot crusts have been properly handled, there is nothing to save, and the students' waste when eating has also been reduced. There is nothing wrong with the old method of cooking rice, so why bother with new tricks?" Some people also said: "A grain of rice is still a grain of rice, there is no difference. If you say that steaming rice can save grain, unless people don't like to eat it, otherwise it is absolutely impossible to save so much grain in a day. Don't 'try to steal a chicken and end up losing rice,' which would cause waste instead." During the trial, half a catty more water was added per catty of rice than the old method of cooking rice. Some people thought after knowing this: This pot of rice is probably going to become porridge. When will so much water be absorbed? But when the comrades saw that the燜 (mèn) bucket was full of white and fluffy rice, the above doubts and concerns were dispelled. During the experiment, we also deeply understood whether the steamed rice was delicious and whether it was easy to get hungry after eating it. The results proved that the "Raw Rice Steaming Method" was universally welcomed by teachers, students, and staff.
    With the support of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, the Tilanqiao District Committee, and other leading organs, we have introduced this steaming method to more than 680 units in the entire district; food service groups from more than 100 units in other districts have also sent people to visit. It is said that the CPC Putuo District Committee, Xinguang Underwear Factory, and other units have achieved practical results by trying this steaming method. All of this shows that the "Raw Rice Steaming Method" plays a significant role in saving grain.

### 我们的食堂实行了“生米蒸饭法”

专栏：每个集体伙食单位都要节约粮食

    我们的食堂实行了“生米蒸饭法”
    崔豪
    我是上海澄衷中学的事务员。三月底，我们听说常州师范学校学习重庆四川大学的“生米蒸饭法”做饭，能够节约很多粮食，便在学校党组织和行政领导方面的支持下，于四月上旬，派伙食团的同志前往常州实地参观学习，回校后就试验推行。
    我们在试验以前，曾预先对同学们进行了宣传，说明要试行一种既节约粮食又好吃的蒸饭法，可是因为没有经验，可能蒸出夹生饭来，也可能叫大家吃烂饭。同时，向炊事员同志反复进行说服，使他们认识到多节约一粒米，就是为国家实现社会主义工业化和支援解放台湾增加一份力量；并介绍了先进经验，分析了我们学校的条件，批评了不正确的看法。由于大家对节约粮食有了一定的认识，许多同学和炊事员都表示支持这个工作。于是，我们便在学生大食堂开始试验了。过了三天，有些同学问我们：既然蒸饭可以节约粮食，为什么不吃蒸饭呢？其实他们已经吃了三天蒸饭还不知道。这说明我们的试验是成功了。我们就在五月七日在全校推行了“生米蒸饭法”。
      “生米蒸饭法”，大致可分三个步骤：
    一、将预先淘好的米，放到木蒸桶内上锅蒸，约蒸三十分钟（也可以按蒸汽上来后十五分钟计算，时间的长短要看米的多少来决定，这里是以一百五十斤米为标准计算的）。这一步骤主要是把生米蒸热，使米裂开，便于在第二个步骤中充分吸水。这样蒸过的米，因吸收了蒸汽和淘米时的一部分水分，重量约比原来的生米增加了百分之十五左右。
    二、把蒸好的米，倒在木焖桶里加开水（必须要正在开的水，而且动作要快，以防热量发散），水加入后，用铲刀搅一次，盖上木盖，焖上十五至二十分钟。桶内压力小，水分可以吸得足，米能充分膨胀。经过这样焖后，米已初步形成饭。饭的软硬完全决定于加水多少。一般加水标准：一斤籼米可加一斤十二两到二斤；粳米一斤可加一斤半到一斤十两左右。如一百斤籼米蒸后成为一百十五斤，再加一百八十五斤水来焖，焖出来的饭便不软不硬。
    三、焖桶里的饭虽然基本上烧好，但是桶的四周及桶的上下还有些夹生米；当中的饭虽然已熟，但还没完全吸水。因此，要把焖桶里的饭再放到蒸桶内去回蒸一次。这次一般蒸到上汽后五分钟左右，即成软硬均匀的饭。整个一锅饭的全部操作过程，约需要八十分钟至九十分钟。
    根据我校试行结果，旧法煮饭每斤籼米可煮二斤六两饭左右，粳米可煮二斤三两左右；改用“生米蒸饭法”后，每斤籼米可蒸二斤十四两至三斤左右，胀性最好的籼米可蒸到三斤六两以上，粳米每斤可蒸二斤十两左右。新法比旧法做的饭在重量上约增加百分之二十至二十一，体积也增加了百分之十五，也就是节约了百分之十五的粮食。根据全校用粮情况，用旧法煮饭每天需用米五百五十斤左右，改用蒸饭后，每天只用米四百七十斤，每天能节约粮食八十多斤；一个月以二十六天计算（星期日不开伙），能节约二千多斤粮食。
    这种蒸饭法的设备也很简单，完全可以利用原有的设备，不论那种式样或烧那种燃料的炉灶，都可利用，只须添置木蒸桶、焖桶、白铁垫各一只。
    我们在宣传“生米蒸饭法”时，也遇到过各种各样的思想障碍。有的人感到：“我们的剩饭、剩粥、锅巴都已作了适当的处理，没有什么可节约了，同学吃饭时的浪费也减少了，老法煮饭并没有什么不好呀，又何必要翻什么新花样呢。”也有人说：“一粒米总归还是一粒米，并没有什么两样，要是说蒸饭可以节约粮食，除非人家不爱吃，不然的话一天能节约这样多粮食，绝对不可能的，不要‘偷鸡不着蚀把米’，反而造成浪费。”在试行中，每斤米比旧法煮饭多了半斤水，有人知道后就认为：这一锅饭，恐怕要变成稀饭了，这么多的水，什么时候才能吸干？但当同志们看到焖桶里都是又白又松的饭的时候，以上的怀疑和顾虑便都打消了。试验中我们并深入了解蒸的饭是不是好吃，吃下去是否容易饿等情况。结果证明，“生米蒸饭法”受到全校师生员工的普遍欢迎。
    在中共上海市委、提篮桥区委等领导机关的支持下，我们已把这种蒸饭法向全区六百八十多单位作了介绍；其他各区约一百多个单位的伙食团也派人来参观过。听说中共普陀区委、新光内衣厂等单位试行这种蒸饭方法，都已收到了实际效果。这都说明“生米蒸饭法”对节约粮食是有很大作用的。
