    Grain Purchase Plans Must Be Based on Actual Needs

    To the Editor:

    The grain requisition plan drafted by the First Engineering Section, Third Engineering Division of the China North China Baotou Engineering Corporation for June was an average of 74 jin per person per month. The Haidian District People's Committee of Beijing Municipality inspected the grain consumption situation in this engineering section and found that an actual consumption of 45 jin of grain per person per month was sufficient. It turns out that when the food administrator Liu Liankui formulated the grain requisition plan, he did not calculate carefully, nor did he consult with relevant personnel. Under the influence of the erroneous thought of being generous and prepared for extra needs, he proposed an unrealistic figure. And the leaders of this engineering section did not pay attention to the grain consumption plan. As a result, a plan that greatly exceeded actual needs was put forward.

    Because the grain purchase plan was too high, there was a phenomenon of wasting grain. For example, during a general cleaning in June, more than a dozen steamed buns and chunks of corn bread were swept out from under the beds in the dormitory.

    Such phenomena of haphazardly proposing plans and wasting grain cannot be allowed. It is hoped that the leaders of this engineering section will conduct a thorough inspection and correct the practice of not paying attention to grain issues in the future.

### 必须按实际需要订用粮计划

    必须按实际需要订用粮计划编辑同志：
    华北包头工程总公司第三工程处第一工区第三工段六月份编造的需粮计划是每人每月平均七十四斤。北京市海淀区人民委员会到这个工段检查吃粮情况，发现每人每月实际上只吃四十五斤粮食就足够了。原来这个工段订用粮计划的时候，伙食管理员刘连奎没有精打细算，也没有找有关人员研究，在宽打备用的错误思想支配下就提出了一个不切实际的数字。而这个工段的领导人员对用粮计划也不加过问。于是，就提出了这个大大超过实际需要的计划。
    因为用粮计划订得太大，就出现了糟踏粮食的现象。像六月份这个工段大扫除时，就从宿舍的床铺下面扫出了十几个馒头和成块的窝头。
    这种乱提计划和浪费粮食的现象是不能允许的，希望这个工段的领导人员很好地进行检查，并在今后纠正不过问粮食问题的做法。  	一读者
