Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 24th. Indian Chief Representative to the United Nations, Krishna Menon, said at a reception for foreign journalists in New Delhi on the 23rd that since the Four Power Summit Conference, there had been a general improvement in the international situation. The direct Sino-US talks that followed have further improved the situation.
　　
In response to a question, Menon said that the main issue in Asia now is direct Sino-US talks.
　　
When talking about the issues of Korea and Indochina, he said that the situation had improved after the signing of the armistice agreements. However, the more important issue at present is to implement these agreements. He hoped that the disputes there could be resolved through peaceful negotiations.
　　
When commenting on Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal to hold direct talks with the local authorities in Taiwan, Menon said that this is China's internal affair and such talks should be between the central and local governments of that country.
　　
He told reporters that Sino-Indian relations have always been good and are constantly improving, as evidenced by the recent two-month visit of the Indian cultural delegation to China and the expanded trade between the two countries.
　　
An American reporter asked Menon for his opinion on the Soviet Union's decision on disarmament, and Menon replied that, according to newspaper reports, the United States' reaction to this matter was good.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 24th. The "Political Diary" special article in the "Hindustan Times" on the 23rd pointed out that Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal to establish collective peace in Asia is a "very important statement."
　　
The newspaper said that collective peace in Asia "is feasible and practical, but cannot be achieved until Washington relaxes its current attitude."
　　
The "Hindustan Times" pointed out: "Because the United States has a global strategy, this strategy gives it bases on the territory of certain Asian countries." The newspaper mentioned the United States strengthening the armed forces of its allies through military and economic assistance, and condemned the United States for sheltering colonialism and feudalism.

　　梅农说中美直接谈判是现在亚洲主要问题
　　印度报纸表示支持我国关于建立亚洲集体和平的建议
    新华社新德里二十四日电　印度驻联合国首席代表克里希纳·梅农二十三日在新德里举行的外国记者招待会上说，自从四大国政府首脑会议以来，国际局势有了普遍的改善，随后举行的中美直接谈判使局势有了进一步改善。
    梅农在回答问题时说，现在亚洲的主要问题是中美直接谈判。
    他在谈到朝鲜和印度支那问题时说，局势在停战协定签字后是有改进的。但是目前更重要的问题是把这些协定付诸实施。他希望那里的争端能通过和平谈判来予以解决。
    梅农在对周恩来总理关于同台湾地方当局举行直接谈判的建议发表意见时说，这是中国的内政问题，这种谈判应该是那个国家的中央和地方政府间的谈判。
    他告诉记者说，中印关系一直是很好的，并且还在不断得到改进，最近印度文化代表团在中国的为期两个月的访问以及两国间扩大了的贸易都可以证明。
    美国记者问到梅农对苏联裁军的决定的意见，梅农回答说，根据报纸上的报道，美国对这件事的反应是好的。
    新华社新德里二十四日电　“印度斯坦时报”二十三日的“政治日志”特稿栏指出，周恩来总理提出的建立亚洲集体和平的建议是“非常重要的声明”。
    这家报纸说，亚洲的集体和平“是可行的和实际的，但是在华盛顿放松它目前的态度以前是不能实现的”。
    “印度斯坦时报”指出：“因为美国有全球战略，这种战略使它在某些亚洲国家的领土上拥有基地”。这家报纸提到美国通过军事和经济援助加强盟国的武装力量，并且谴责美国庇护殖民主义和封建主义。
