These wreaths were sent by various local organizations of the Japanese Communist Party, left-wing Socialist Party Chairman Mozaburo Suzuki, right-wing Socialist Party Chairman Jotaro Kawakami, and the people of Tokuda Kyuichi's hometown, Okinawa. Red flags were densely arranged on the stage.

At 1:00 PM, the memorial service solemnly began with the music of Chopin's Funeral March. Then, those attending the memorial service sang the mourning song, "Comrades Have Not Fallen."

Central Committee member of the Japanese Communist Party, Kazumi Matsumoto, delivered the opening address. Then, Kenji Miyamoto, Yoshio Shiga, and Ryo Nosaka delivered speeches in succession. They recalled the great deeds of Tokuda Kyuichi during his lifetime.

From 3:00 PM, Tokuda Kyuichi's family members, leading cadres of the Japanese Communist Party, and those who attended the memorial service successively laid flowers before the portrait of Comrade Tokuda Kyuichi, paying their respects to their respected leader.
