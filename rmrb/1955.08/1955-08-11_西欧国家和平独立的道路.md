    The Four-Power Heads of Government Conference has concluded many days ago, but the achievements of the conference remain the focus of world opinion. Peace-loving people in Western European countries especially welcome the Soviet Union's new proposals on guaranteeing European collective security at the conference with satisfaction. Because these proposals are fully in line with the common desire of the people of Western Europe for peace and independence.

    In recent times, in many Western European countries, the sentiment of wanting to break away from foreign control and move towards a path of peaceful independence has grown significantly. More and more people are demanding that the country's peace and independence be ensured and European security be strengthened by adopting a policy of not participating in military blocs and alliances and not allowing foreign military bases to be established on its territory. The Yugoslav newspaper "Politika" recently wrote, when talking about this strong tendency developing in Western European countries: "The developments in the past few years have shown that the independent policy of not participating in blocs and the policy of resolving differences by peaceful means are dominating international relations." The American "Star-Ledger" also admitted at the beginning of this year that "neutralism... has grown to an astonishing scale among the masses in Western and Northern Europe." This is not without foundation.

    Since the war, the disastrous consequences of the war policy of organizing military blocs for Western European countries have become increasingly apparent. Many Western European countries have been dragged into Western military blocs, foreign military bases have been established on their territory, and their political independence and economic interests have been seriously damaged. For example, countries participating in the North Atlantic Group do not even have the right to decide on their own military budgets. The military expenditures of European countries in the North Atlantic Group increased from $4.8 billion in 1949 to $10.6 billion in 1954. Since the establishment of the North Atlantic Group, the military expenditures of Britain and France have increased from less than a quarter of the national budget to about a third. The burdens of these countries are already very heavy, but they are still constantly under pressure to continue expanding their armaments. For example, in order to alleviate a little of the burden of military expenditure, Greece intends to slightly reduce the number of troops, but the North Atlantic Group authorities want Greece not only not to reduce but also to expand the number of troops. As for foreign bases and troops in Western European countries, which rudely infringe upon the sovereignty of various countries, that goes without saying.

    The problem is not just this. Many Western European countries have joined military blocs, and have undertaken military obligations, and are in danger of being dragged into a new war. The organ of the Norwegian Labor Party, "Contact," once uneasily pointed out: "Recognizing the North Atlantic Treaty is tantamount to recognizing the war of aggression waged by a certain North Atlantic Treaty country." After the "Paris Agreements" were approved, a new tension emerged in Europe. Under such circumstances, not only the broad masses of people in Western European countries more resolutely demanded the pursuit of a peaceful and independent policy, but also many more far-sighted bourgeois politicians more clearly expressed their concern that their countries would be dragged into an atomic war. Former French Minister of Defense Moch recently said: Only fifteen hydrogen bombs would be enough to destroy a country the size of France or Britain. Therefore, many Western European countries are facing the more urgent choice: should they continue to follow the military bloc policy that leads to war, thereby inevitably making themselves a battlefield for future wars and suffering huge destruction? Or should they break free from the net of military blocs and war policies and seek a way out for peaceful independence?

    On the other hand, more and more people in Western Europe clearly see that the Soviet Union is sincerely pursuing a policy of peaceful coexistence, willing to develop relations of mutual trust and peaceful cooperation with all countries, and does not harbor any aggressive ambitions. Especially in the recent period, the Soviet Union has carried out a series of major activities in promoting its peaceful diplomatic policy to ease international tensions and promote international trust and cooperation, including proposing new practical and feasible proposals for disarmament, banning atomic weapons, and eliminating the threat of war, taking the initiative to promote the signing of the Austrian State Treaty, holding talks with Yugoslavia that are of major international significance, holding talks with Indian Prime Minister Nehru and issuing joint statements supporting peaceful coexistence and international cooperation, and advocating and promoting mutual visits between parliamentarians of various countries to enhance understanding, etc. These activities have had a huge impact on easing international tensions. Few people still believe in the so-called "Soviet aggression threat."

    The signing of the Austrian State Treaty has a special significance for other Western European countries. It powerfully pointed out the path to peaceful independence to Western European countries. The example of Austria proves beyond doubt that even under the current conditions, a country can still avoid being involved in military blocs and the arms race and risking a new war. Therefore, the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty naturally has a huge impact in Western European countries.

    First of all, it greatly encouraged the West German people's movement for peaceful reunification. The call for the establishment of a unified Germany that does not participate in military blocs is unprecedentedly high in West Germany. The recent split of the West German Refugee Party and its withdrawal from the Bonn government is another example of the increasingly isolated policy of the Adenauer government to militarize West Germany and drag West Germany into Western military blocs. A particularly noteworthy event is that Bunning, the former military adviser to the West German Ministry of Defense, recently also published a proposal that a unified Germany should not participate in any alliances and should demand the withdrawal of foreign occupying forces and the abolition of foreign military bases, and his proposal has been widely supported by people from all walks of life in West Germany. Therefore, the Paris "International Handbook" said: "The advocacy of 'Austrian-style' diplomacy and 'European policy of becoming a third force between the United States and the Soviet Union' is increasingly rising among the West German bourgeoisie."

    The Soviet government's note on June 7 inviting the West German government to send representatives to Moscow to discuss issues related to the establishment of diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries undoubtedly gave greater encouragement to the forces in West Germany that demanded a path of peaceful independence. Newspapers of various backgrounds pointed out that the West German government should seize this opportunity to promote the restoration of German unification.

    The example of Austria has also aroused great interest in many other Western European countries. Newspapers and politicians in Italy, France, Belgium, and Scandinavian countries have talked about the significance of not participating in military blocs and alliances in the current international situation. For example, in Italy, the Catholic weekly "Perspectives," which represents the views of Italian President Gronchi, pointed out that there is a real possibility for Italy to pursue a policy of promoting the easing of international tensions and establishing good-neighborly relations between countries together with neutral countries. The recent cabinet crisis in Italy largely shows that the so-called "North Atlantic policy," that is, the policy of preparing for a new war by establishing hostile military blocs, is becoming increasingly unpopular in Italy. People from all walks of life in Italy widely demand the implementation of an independent foreign policy and firmly avoid being involved in the North Atlantic Group's war. The decision of the North Atlantic Alliance Military Command to transfer the American troops stationed in Austria to Italy has aroused strong anger among the Italian people, which is completely understandable.

    Even in countries like Greece, a tendency towards peaceful independence is beginning to develop. Some foreign journalists stationed in Athens have recently often talked about the infectious influence of "Austrian neutralism" in Greece.

    The tendency towards peaceful independence developing in Western European countries has an undeniable significance for consolidating European and world peace. It is very clear that if many Western European countries adopt a policy of not participating in military blocs and not establishing foreign military bases on their territory, the plan to launch a new war in Europe will suffer the most serious blow, which will greatly contribute to maintaining peace in Europe and easing tensions in Europe.

    It is precisely because of this reason that certain forces feel frightened and uneasy about the growing tendency towards peaceful independence in Western European countries. These forces are doing their best to oppose this demand, and even distort the facts to belittle the significance of the principle of peaceful neutrality. But they cannot come up with any convincing reasons to explain why Western European countries cannot choose the path of peaceful independence. Finnish Prime Minister Kekkonen recently concluded, based on his country's experience: "I believe that the current international policy is in such a stage of development that true neutrality is possible... It can be said with certainty that this will be suitable for promoting the cause of European peace." This is a powerful rebuttal to those who oppose Western European countries from taking the path of peaceful and independent development.

    The strong desire for peaceful independence developing in Western European countries became a driving force for the Four-Power Heads of Government Conference. At the same time, the Four-Power Conference powerfully affirmed the use of consultation rather than war to solve international problems, thereby further promoting the movement for peaceful independence in Western European countries. The Soviet delegation stated at the conference that if countries that wish to pursue a policy of neutrality and non-participation in military blocs and alliances raise the issue of guaranteeing their security and territorial inviolability, the Soviet Union will be prepared to participate in such guarantees together with other countries. This should of course especially attract the attention and importance of Western European countries. There is no doubt that the people of Western European countries will more actively strive for a future of peaceful independence.

    西欧国家和平独立的道路
    谭文瑞
    四国政府首脑会议已经结束许多天了，但是会议的成就仍然是世界舆论谈论的中心。西欧各国爱好和平人民特别怀着满意的心情欢迎苏联在会议上提出的关于保障欧洲集体安全的新建议。因为这些建议是完全符合西欧人民要求和平和独立的共同愿望的。
    最近时期以来，在西欧许多国家中，希望摆脱外国控制而走向和平独立道路的情绪有着显著的增长，愈来愈多的人要求通过采取不参加军事集团和联盟、不让外国在本国领土上建立军事基地的政策，来确保国家的和平独立以及加强欧洲的安全。南斯拉夫“政治报”不久以前在谈到在西欧国家中发展的这种强烈倾向时曾经写道：“过去几年中的事态发展表明，不参加集团的独立政策和用和平方法排解纷歧的政策，正在国际关系中占优势。”美国的“明星晚报”在今年年初也承认“中立主义……已在西欧和北欧的群众中间惊人规模地滋长着”。这都不是没有根据的。
    战后以来，组织军事集团的战争政策，给西欧各国带来的灾难后果是愈来愈明显了。许多西欧国家被拖进了西方的军事集团，本国的领土被外国建立军事基地，自己的政治独立和经济利益都受到了严重的损害。例如参加了北大西洋集团的各国，甚至没有权利决定自己的军事预算。北大西洋集团的欧洲国家的军费从一九四九年的四十八亿美元增加到一九五四年的一百零六亿美元。英国和法国的军费自从成立北大西洋集团以来，已经从原来占国家总预算的不到四分之一增加到占三分之一上下。这些国家的负担已经非常沉重，但是它们仍然不断受到压力，要它们继续扩充军备。例如希腊为了减轻一点军费的重担，有意思要把军队数目略予减少，但是北大西洋集团当局却要希腊不但不能削减而且还得扩充军队的数目。至于外国在西欧国家的基地和驻军，粗暴地侵犯各国的主权，那就更不用说了。
    问题还不仅这样。西欧许多国家参加了军事集团，就承担了军事义务，有被拖进新战争里去的危险。挪威的政府党的机关报“联系报”曾经不安地指出：“承认北大西洋公约就是承认了某一北大西洋公约国所进行的侵略战争。”在“巴黎协定”批准以后，欧洲曾出现了新的紧张局势。在这种情形下，西欧各国中不仅广大人民更坚决地要求奉行和平独立的政策，许多较有远见的资产阶级政界人士也愈来愈明白地表示担心他们的国家会被拖进原子战争中去。法国的前国防部长莫克最近就说过：只要十五个氢弹，就足以使法国或英国那样大小的一个国家毁灭。因此，西欧许多国家就更迫切地面临这样的抉择：究竟是继续遵循导向战争的军事集团政策，从而无可避免地使自己成为未来战争的战场，遭受巨大的毁灭呢？还是摆脱军事集团和战争政策的罗网，而寻求和平独立的出路？
    另一方面，西欧愈来愈多的人清楚地看到，苏联真心诚意奉行和平共处的政策，愿意同一切国家发展相互信任、和平合作的关系，不抱任何侵略野心。特别是在最近一个时期中间，苏联在推行它的和平外交政策中，进行了一连串缓和国际局势、促进国际信任和合作的重大活动，包括提出新的切实可行的裁军、禁止原子武器和消除战争威胁的建议，主动促成奥地利国家条约的签订，和南斯拉夫举行了具有重大国际意义的会谈，和印度总理尼赫鲁会谈并发表支持和平共处和国际合作的联合声明，以及主张和促进各国之间议员的互相访问以增进谅解等等。这些活动对于缓和国际局势产生了巨大的作用。现在很少人还相信所谓“苏联侵略威胁”那一类的鬼话了。
    奥地利国家条约的签订，对于其他西欧国家具有特别的意义，它向西欧国家有力地指点了和平独立的道路。奥地利的例子确凿无疑地证明，就是在目前的条件下，一个国家还是能够避免被卷入军事集团和军备竞赛并冒新战争的危险的。所以奥地利国家条约的缔结很自然地在西欧各国产生巨大的影响。
    首先，它大大鼓舞了西德人民争取和平统一的运动。要求建立一个统一的、不参加军事集团的德国的呼声在西德空前地高涨。最近西德难民党的分裂和退出波恩政府，是阿登纳政府使西德军国主义化和把西德拖入西方军事集团的政策愈来愈趋于孤立的又一个事例。特别值得注意的一件事是：前西德国防部军事顾问波宁最近也发表统一后的德国不参加任何联盟并要求撤退外国占领军和取消外国军事基地的主张，而他这个主张获得西德各方面人士的广泛支持。所以巴黎“国际手册”说：“‘奥地利式’的外交和‘成为美、苏之间第三种力量的欧洲政策’这种主张，正在西德资产阶级中间日益抬头。”
    苏联政府六月七日发出照会邀请西德政府派遣代表前往莫斯科讨论有关两国建立外交和贸易关系问题的举动，无疑的使西德要求走和平独立道路的力量获得更大的鼓舞。各种不同背景的报刊都指出，西德政府应当抓住这个机会来促成德国统一的恢复。
    奥地利的实例，在其他许多西欧国家中也引起了很大的兴趣。意大利、法国、比利时以及斯堪的纳维亚国家里的报刊和政治人物都纷纷谈论关于不参加军事集团和联盟在当前国际局势中的意义。例如在意大利，代表意大利总统格隆基派意见的天主教“前景”周刊曾经指出，在意大利面前存在着实际的可能来同中立国家一道奉行促进缓和国际紧张局势和建立各国善邻关系的政策。意大利最近一次内阁危机就在很大程度上表明了所谓“北大西洋政策”，也就是以成立敌对的军事集团来准备新战争的政策，在意大利已愈来愈不得人心。意大利各阶层人民广泛要求执行独立自主的外交政策，坚决避免被卷进北大西洋集团的战争。北大西洋联盟军事司令部关于把驻奥美军调到意大利的决定，激起了意大利人民强烈的愤怒，是完全可以理解的。
    就在希腊这样的国家，也开始发展着一种和平独立的倾向。一些驻在雅典的外国记者近来常常谈到“奥地利中立主义”在希腊发生的传染性的影响。
    西欧国家中发展着的要求和平独立的倾向，对于巩固欧洲和世界和平有着不可低估的意义。事情很明白，如果西欧的许多国家采取不参加军事集团和不在自己领土上建立外国军事基地的政策，就将使在欧洲发动新战争的计划遭到最严重的打击，那样将会大大有利于保持欧洲的和平和缓和欧洲的紧张局势。
    正是因为这样的原故，所以某些势力对西欧国家中日益增长的要求和平独立的倾向感到惊惶和不安。这种势力用尽气力来反对这种要求，甚至不惜歪曲事实来贬低和平中立原则的意义。但是它们拿不出任何令人信服的理由来说明：为什么西欧的国家不能选择和平独立的道路。芬兰总理吉科宁不久以前曾经根据他的国家的经验得出结论说：“我认为目前国际政策是处在这样一个发展的阶段中，就是：真正的中立是可能的。……可以肯定地说，这样将适合于促进欧洲和平的事业。”这是对反对西欧国家走和平独立发展的道路的人们的一个有力的驳斥。
    在西欧国家中发展起来的要求和平独立的强烈愿望，成为四国政府首脑会议的一个动力，同时四国会议有力地肯定了用协商而不是战争的办法来解决国际问题，因而进一步推动了西欧各国中争取和平独立的运动。苏联代表团在会议上表示，如果希望奉行中立和不参加军事集团和联盟政策的国家提出关于保障它们的安全和领土不可侵犯的保证问题，苏联将准备同其他国家一起参加这种保证。这当然应该特别引起西欧国家的注意和重视。毫无疑问，西欧各国人民必将更积极地争取和平独立的前途。
