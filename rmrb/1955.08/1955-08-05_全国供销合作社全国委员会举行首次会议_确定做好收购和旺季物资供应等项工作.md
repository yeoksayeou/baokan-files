Xinhua News Agency, August 4th—The First National Committee of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives held its first meeting in Beijing from July 30th to August 2nd.

At the meeting, the Council of the National Federation made reports on its main work over the past year and the balance sheet and related finances as of December 31, 1954, as well as further developing the socialist transformation of rural private commerce and on practicing thrift and opposing waste in the supply and marketing cooperative system. The Supervisory Committee made reports on its work over the past year and the Supervisory Committee’s budget for 1955.

From the Council's report, it can be seen that in the past year, the Council, in accordance with the principles and tasks stipulated by the First National Congress of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, has achieved many successes in implementing the supply and marketing cooperatives to serve agricultural production, arranging for the transformation of rural private businesses, and leading the rural market. In terms of finance, the financial situation of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in 1954 was further developed on the basis of the trend towards stability in 1953. Self-owned funds increased by 1.3 times in a year. Loans from banks decreased by 47.18 million yuan compared with the previous year.

After the Council's work reports, the Supervisory Committee made comments on the Council's work in the past year, stating that in the past year, the Council conscientiously and correctly implemented the principles and tasks stipulated by the First National Congress of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, and its work has made new progress. However, after inspection, several enterprises of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives still have a certain degree of pure profit-seeking in some aspects of their business management, and they do not care enough about the needs of lower-level cooperatives and consumers. There is a lot of blindness in the business operations of cooperatives at all levels, and phenomena such as mildewed materials, embezzlement, bribery, fire, and theft are quite serious. This is mainly because the political work of the cooperatives is weak, the business operation and financial management systems are lacking or not sound enough, and the political and professional levels of the staff have not been improved quickly enough. The report pointed out that strengthening political work is an important link in the current work.

The meeting determined that the main work of the Council in the second half of 1955 is to implement the decisions of the National Supply and Marketing Cooperative Supply and Procurement Business Conference, do a good job of purchasing and peak season material supply, and further develop the transformation and arrangement of rural private commerce. Resolutely implement comprehensive thrift. Strengthen political and ideological education, and deeply carry out the struggle to eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all counter-revolutionary elements. The work of the Supervisory Committee focuses on supervising and inspecting the completion of the supply and marketing cooperatives' plans and the implementation of increased production and thrift.

After discussion, the meeting unanimously approved the above reports and corresponding resolutions, and passed the resolution on striving to realize the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy. At the same time, based on the suggestions of the National Federation Supervisory Committee and the Liaoning Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the resolution on removing Zhou Yongchun from the position of member of the National Committee was passed.

Finally, the meeting elected Chen Naijun, Hui Qingqi, and Han Peiqi as members of the Council.

    全国供销合作社全国委员会举行首次会议
    确定做好收购和旺季物资供应等项工作
    新华社四日讯　七月三十日到八月二日，中华全国供销合作社第一届全国委员会在北京举行第一次会议。
    会上，全国总社理事会作了关于一年来主要工作和一九五四年十二月三十一日资产负债表及有关财务的报告，以及进一步开展对农村私营商业进行社会主义改造和关于在供销合作社系统内厉行节约反对浪费等报告。监事会作了关于一年来监事会的工作和监事会一九五五年的经费预算报告。
    从理事会的报告中看出，一年来理事会依据中华全国合作社第一次代表大会规定的方针任务，在贯彻供销合作社为农业生产服务，安排改造农村私商和领导农村市场等方面的工作已取得了很多成绩。财务方面，一九五四年全国供销合作总社的财务状况在一九五三年趋向稳固的基础上，有了进一步的发展。一年来自有资金增加了一点三倍。向银行的借款较上年减少了四千七百十八万元。
    理事会各项工作报告之后，监事会对理事会过去一年来的工作提出意见称：一年来理事会认真正确地执行了全国合作社第一次代表大会所规定的方针和任务，工作上有了新的发展。但经过检查，全国供销合作总社的若干企业单位，在某些方面的经营管理上还有一定程度的单纯利润观点，对下级社和消费者的需要关心还不够。各级社业务经营上有不少盲目性，物资霉烂、贪污舞弊、失火、失盗等现象相当严重。这主要是由于合作社政治工作薄弱，业务经营和财务管理制度缺乏或不够健全以及职工的政治水平和业务水平提高都不够快。报告指出，加强政治工作是当前工作中的重要环节。
    会议确定一九五五年下半年理事会的主要工作，是贯彻全国供销合作社供应采购业务会议的各项决定，做好收购和旺季物资供应工作；进一步开展对农村私营商业的改造和安排工作。坚决贯彻厉行全面节约。加强政治思想教育，深入地开展肃清胡风反革命集团和一切反革命分子的斗争。监事会的工作，着重监督检查供销合作社对计划的完成和增产节约的执行情况。
    会议经过讨论，一致通过了上述报告和相应的决议，并通过了关于为实现发展国民经济第一个五年计划而奋斗的决议。同时，根据全国总社监事会和辽宁省供销合作社的建议，通过了关于撤销周永春全国委员会委员职务的决议。
    会议最后补选了陈乃君、惠庆琪、韩佩琦为理事会理事。
