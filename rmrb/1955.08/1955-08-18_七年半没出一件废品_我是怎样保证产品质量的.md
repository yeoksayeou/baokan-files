Seven and a Half Years Without a Single Defective Product
——How I Guarantee Product Quality
詹水晶

Let Me First Talk About My Understanding

In November 1947, I joined the Dalian Shipbuilding Company's Machinery Factory. For seven and a half years, I haven't produced a single defective product or rework, and I have exceeded my production targets every month.

When I first arrived at the factory, I only thought that when you're working, you have to look like you're working. As a craftsman, it's embarrassing to produce defective products! So I tried my best not to produce any.

Later, under the Party's education, I understood the relationship between the factory and myself, and realized that producing defective products wasn't just a matter of personal appearance, but would affect production development and workers' living improvements. During the factory's major quality inspection, the trade union calculated the details: scrapping one "large diversion damper" would waste 10,000 yuan for the state, and scrapping a copper nut would cost 40 or 50 cents. I thought: at home, if a child breaks a bowl, we say, "A bowl is worth ten cents, why don't you cherish it?" The factory is our home, but we don't care about scrapping a copper nut. What should we say about that? Shouldn't we cherish state property even more than our own things? Furthermore, the parts we machine are used to conquer the sea and the ocean. If the parts we make have problems in the sea, is that a joke?

After strengthening my sense of responsibility for ensuring product quality, my thinking also changed. In the past, I only asked those with higher technical grades than me about the jobs I hadn't done before, thinking it looked "better." Now, I ask anyone, regardless of their grade, feeling that there's nothing embarrassing about it. In the past, I only focused on working according to the blueprints, but now I also pay attention to and inquire about the product's use at any time. Therefore, I can also discover and actively point out errors in the blueprints.

I deeply realize that guaranteeing quality and completing output are not contradictory. For more than seven years, because I haven't produced any defective products or rework, I have accurately completed the plan and exceeded my targets every month.

My specific experiences in guaranteeing product quality are:

One, proactively care about product quality, not only guarantee your own quality, but also resolutely fight against phenomena that cause poor quality.

Two, never be careless or sloppy when working. Carefully prepare for production and concentrate all your attention when machining.

Three, ask questions if you don't understand, learn with an open mind, especially learn from Soviet experience and implement expert advice.

Four, strictly abide by operating procedures and safety regulations, and cherish machinery and equipment.

Five, foster good unity, especially among the three shifts, to jointly guarantee quality.

Now, let me briefly introduce these experiences.

We Should Persist in Struggle

Once, I received the task of making three "crosshead connecting rods." When I checked the blueprint, I found that the size of the rod's neck was different from what I had made before. I thought: these "crosshead connecting rods" are used on ships for reversing the engine, and the thinner neck won't be able to withstand the stress. Could there be a problem with the blueprint? I asked the inspection section chief, Cao Yutang, to study it, and he also thought the rod's neck was too thin. I asked him if I could thicken the neck, and he said the blueprint was drawn by the design department, and he couldn't make the decision.

I asked the dispatcher, Little Wang, "Is the size of this part correct?"

He said, "Isn't there a blueprint?"

At this time, some comrades also said to me: just work according to the blueprint. Anyway, if the design department's blueprint is wrong, we won't be responsible. I thought: this idea is wrong! Although I'm not responsible if the blueprint is wrong, poor product quality is the greatest waste. It takes half a month to machine these three rods. If I try to save trouble now and don't ask clearly, and the machined parts don't meet the standards, then this half month will be wasted.

I told Little Wang my doubts, and he went to the design department to ask and came back saying, "It's really annoying! The comrades in the design department said, 'Tell him to just work according to the blueprint, who cares if it's thick or thin!'"

I said, "I know how to work according to the blueprint, otherwise I wouldn't go there to work! I'm afraid the blueprint is wrong and will cause problems, that's why I asked them. I think the neck is too thin, and I told them the reason for my doubt. If they say it's not thin, they should tell me the reason why it's not thin. What's the point of being confused?"

Little Wang thought for a moment and said, "I'll go again!"

This time, the comrades in the design department still said, "The drawing was traced from the old model, tell him to work according to the drawing, there's nothing wrong!"

I thought: tracing from the old model doesn't guarantee that there won't be a mistake in a single number! Let me go to the warehouse to compare with the old model. I absolutely cannot just let it go confusedly. Little Wang said, "If you're not afraid of trouble, I'm not afraid of trouble, I'll go measure it!"

This measurement revealed that the blueprint was drawn six centimeters too small. This reminded the comrades in the design department to correct the error on the blueprint.

The workshop's blackboard newspaper praised Little Wang and me, believing that being proactively responsible for quality and persisting in struggle is what should be done. This incident also educated me, making me feel that not only should I pay attention to ensuring quality, but I should also pay attention to others, especially the processes related to my work. Guaranteeing quality requires everyone's cooperation; you can't only take care of yourself.

At the same time, as long as you're responsible to the state, you should persist in struggle, whether for yourself or for others. Whatever is right, you should do it right. Only with this determination can you guarantee quality.

Put Your Heart Into Your Work

Producing defective products and rework is often due to carelessness; therefore, you must be humble and cautious with each task and concentrate all your energy.

Before machining, I pay attention to carefully preparing for production. The most important thing is to thoroughly understand the blueprint. Be sure to ask clearly about anything you don't understand. For example, if a character looks like both a "3" and a "5," you can't think, "It's probably a 5!" We must never do "probably" work. Once, I checked the blueprint for the windlass. This windlass has nine stages. The blueprint indicated that the total length was more than twenty meters, but only six stages on the blueprint had dimensions. I can't say, "Let's start cutting the material first, anyway, we have the total length." I can't say, "Let's machine these six stages first, anyway, it won't be done in a day or two, we'll ask as we go." According to my habit, I must first thoroughly understand the entire blueprint. At this time, I first asked the engineering technician to clarify the dimensions of these three stages. Only then did I discover that adding up the dimensions of these nine stages didn't match the total length on the blueprint. After finding the comrades in the design department to calculate again, they realized that the total length on the blueprint was short by six hundred centimeters. If we had cut the material first, machined it first, and then asked, wouldn't that have been terrible?

The inspection of tools, fixtures, and raw materials is the same. For example, everyone uses micrometers and dial indicators. Sometimes they become inaccurate, so you must check them and correct the problems in advance.

Concentrating all my energy during working hours has become my habit. Arguing with my spouse, worrying about my children... these things cannot be brought to the workplace. If you bring them to the workplace, your mind will wander, and quality will not be guaranteed.

Sometimes, things at the workplace can also prevent you from concentrating on production. At this time, you also need to restrain yourself. For example, when the work hours for a batch of work are set, you see that the work hours have been underestimated, and you're about to earn less piece-rate wages. What should you do? I've encountered this kind of thing before. My approach is to ignore it first and focus on working with all my heart. Some comrades see that the work hours are underestimated, so they immediately negotiate to request a correction. They run around, and the work hours are corrected, but their time is also lost. When they return to the lathe, they still have to talk to others, saying how the one who calculated the work hours was wrong. Their minds can't settle down for a while, which is very detrimental to guaranteeing quality.

You can't think that you don't need to be so careful when doing rough work. Defective work doesn't come from precision work, but often from rough work. There was a worker in our group who was making "small swings" for ships. When he was drilling the pinholes for the first batch of ten or so, he used a template for comparison, and the quality was very good. Ten days later, he did this work again, making twenty, but six were scrapped because he thought he had experience and didn't need to compare anymore. At that time, I was making the axles for the small swings. I made three hundred and fifty and didn't produce a single defective product because I compared each one with a template.

Caution and prudence mean not working blindly, but it doesn't mean being timid and not daring to give full play to your initiative and creativity. After figuring out the rules on the basis of guaranteeing quality, you can steadily increase output. For example, when I was working on a batch of "stern shafts," the first one took thirty-nine work hours, the second one took thirty-two and a half work hours, and the last one only took twenty-one work hours. Because I knew how to guarantee quality, I slowly increased the speed of the machine tool from fourteen revolutions per minute to twenty-one revolutions per minute, then to thirty-six revolutions per minute. When the speed couldn't go any faster, I increased the feed rate and the depth of cut. Last year, I completed 208% of the work hour quota. This year, I completed the work hour quota for the first half of the year two months ahead of schedule.

Continuously Improve Technology

To improve quality and comprehensively complete tasks, you need to continuously improve your technology and learn from others with an open mind. Whenever I encounter a job I haven't done before, I always try my best to ask those who have done it before for advice. Once, I was making copper heads for generators, which I hadn't done before. At that time, Zhang Liande had just finished his apprenticeship. I knew he often did this work, so I went to him for advice. Little Zhang told me in detail about the use of this part, the machining method, and his experience. I machined the first part according to his words and took it to him for inspection. After looking at it carefully, he said, "It's guaranteed to work!" Only then did I continue to work. This avoided detours and guaranteed quality.

We also cannot relax our attention to advanced experience. High-speed cutting and multi-tool, multi-edge machining were all learned at the Dalian Shipbuilding Company. The Kolesov tool method was something I "stumbled" upon in my spare time by reading the newspaper.

I especially value learning from Soviet experience and implementing expert advice. This is the quickest and easiest way to improve technology. For example, the "crankshafts" we machined were always prone to flattening, which was very troublesome to repair, so I went to a Soviet expert to ask about this problem. When the Soviet expert, Yudin, saw that I had taken the initiative to ask him a question, he was very happy and immediately taught us a method. After we did it according to this method, the parts we machined were very precise. In the past, it took fifteen days and nights to machine a large crankshaft, but now it only takes a little over ten days to complete.

The Most Basic Requirements

Abiding by labor discipline is a basic requirement that should be met. If you don't abide by labor discipline, you definitely won't do a good job.

To abide by labor discipline, you must first abide by technical operating procedures and safety regulations. If you don't abide by them, you can't guarantee quality. Some people in our workshop don't seriously abide by operating procedures, resulting in defective products and rework. This is clearly not a technical problem. Why don't they abide by operating procedures? It's either carelessness or trying to save trouble. They want to work with little effort and earn more piece-rate wages. But this is detrimental to both the country and the individual. For example, if you seriously abide by operating procedures, you can make eight parts a day, and they all guarantee quality; if you don't abide by operating procedures, you can make ten parts a day, but five are scrapped. Which is better? If there are reworked parts, it's even more troublesome than redoing them. Some people try to "save trouble" and don't abide by operating procedures, only wanting to take a chance. This is dangerous. For example, if the screws on the chuck jaws are not fully tightened, the part will fly out when machining. This year, two people have been injured in our workshop because of this. If you don't use a hook to remove iron filings when they stick to the part and use your hand to touch them, someone will get their fingers crushed. In these seven and a half years, I haven't had a single accident because I abided by operating procedures.

People who abide by labor discipline will definitely not be absent from work without a valid reason. In these seven and a half years, I have not only never been absent from work, but I have never even taken a single day of personal leave.

Over these seven years, to say there are no "personal matters", how is that possible? But it all depends on how you handle them. I left Zhejiang when I was thirteen years old and hadn't been home for over twenty years. My father wanted me to go home to see him. I thought: I'll take a few more days off during the Spring Festival, and the leaders will take care of me. However, our workshop is "one radish in one hole," with no spare people. If I'm gone for ten or fifteen days, who will do my work? After thinking about it, completing the state's tasks is the big thing. I sent money to my father and asked him to come to the Northeast to play. My father was still quite "strong" and came to Dalian. Later, my spouse and my five-year-old son went back to my hometown in Zhejiang. This put my father at ease.

Let me give two more examples: I got married in my thirties, and my relatives and friends were all happy when my first son turned one year old. It just so happened that it wasn't a holiday that day, and my spouse asked me to take a day of personal leave to help take care of the guests. I didn't want to take leave, so she got angry and said, "What will happen to the factory if you're gone for a day?" I had to persuade her first. I said that the factory is not like the countryside. If I'm gone for a day, the task will be affected. Although entertaining guests at home is a pleasant thing, affecting the completion of the task will be unpleasant. We agreed that the main relatives and friends would leave later. As soon as I got off work, the leaders called me back. The relatives and friends hadn't left yet. The production task was completed, and I also gathered with my relatives and friends. This kind of happiness is complete.

Another time, my eldest daughter got lung disease, and my spouse didn't know where the Sino-Soviet Hospital was. I got up at four in the morning and sent them to the Sino-Soviet Hospital, and I still wasn't late for work. With this kind of thing, if you don't plan well, you'll always have to take a half-day or a day of personal leave. If you plan well, you can avoid personal leave.

Finally, I would like to especially talk about the issue of cherishing machinery and equipment.

For more than seven years, I only used Soviet machine tools for three months. The rest of the time, I used two old belt-driven lathes that were even older than me. The tolerance of the parts I made could not exceed three threads (one thread is about one-eighth of a hair), but I strictly guaranteed the quality. An important reason for this is that I paid attention to maintaining the machine tools. I absolutely don't let iron filings stick to the bed surface, and I also explain the condition of the lathes in detail during shift changes, never being careless.

To guarantee quality and complete tasks, these are the minimum things we should do.

Rely on Everyone's Strength

Machining large parts is done by three shifts in a row. Therefore, fostering good unity among the three shifts is especially important for guaranteeing product quality.

Not producing defective products is everyone's wish. This requires close cooperation among the three shifts. You can't have the attitude of "whoever scraps it is responsible." For example, the technical grades of me, Lu Hengzhen, and Su Zhaowen are seven, six, and four, respectively. Generally speaking, those with higher technical grades are more confident in doing precision work, so I try my best to choose the precision parts to do, leaving the parts that don't require much precision to others. In this way, everyone can fully exert their working abilities, and product quality can be guaranteed.

Whether the three shifts are united depends on how well the shift handover is done. We pay a lot of attention to shift handover. Once, I was supposed to hand over at 4:30 in the afternoon, but Old Lu didn't come to take over on time. I kept working and waiting. At five o'clock, Old Lu rushed over in a huff. It turned out that he liked to play basketball, and he forgot the time while watching the game. Even though he was late, I couldn't leave in a hurry. I still followed our old rules: giving the reliever a detailed and clear explanation, not only explaining the problems on the blueprint in detail, but also explaining when to oil the machine tool, so as not to have you pour a pot of oil on it, and then I pour a pot of oil on it, causing waste. After washing my hands, I went back to the lathe and asked the reliever if there were any questions. He said there were no questions, and then I went home.

Sometimes, the reliever says there are no questions, but there may still be something they forgot to ask. Once, after I sharpened the tool, I hid it to prevent others from taking it randomly, and the reliever didn't know. When I went home, I always felt like there was something. Before I could sit down at home, I remembered it. I didn't even eat dinner and immediately ran back to the factory. Only by explaining everything that should be explained can we guarantee product quality.

Old Lu said it well: "If you want to foster good unity among the three shifts, everyone must not have selfish motives. Everyone must think about product quality and think about completing tasks." This sentence is very reasonable. We discuss everything together. When we discuss it, it always works because everyone doesn't want to take small advantages and doesn't have selfish motives. When we worked on the old belt-driven lathes in the large work section, that's how we jointly eliminated defective products.

Finally, I want to say in summary: Over these seven years, without the Party's education and the strength of the masses, I wouldn't have been able to guarantee improving quality or guarantee eliminating defective products and rework. This should be said to be the most fundamental experience in guaranteeing quality.

    七年半没出一件废品
    ——我是怎样保证产品质量的
    詹水晶
    先说说我的认识
    一九四七年十一月，我进了大连造船公司机械厂，七年半没有出过一件废品和返修活，月月超额完成生产任务。
    我刚到工厂的时候，只寻思干活就得像个干活的样。做一个手艺人，出废品多难看！所以我尽力争取不出废品。
    以后，在党的教育下，我知道了工厂同自己的关系，明白出废品不是个人好看不好看，而是会影响生产发展和工人生活改善的问题。工厂进行质量大检查时，工会算了一下细账：干废一个“大错风门”就要给国家浪费一万元，干废一个铜螺丝帽也要损失四、五角钱。我想：在家里，要是孩子打了一个碗，也要说：“一个碗值一角钱，怎么这样不爱惜呢？”工厂是我们的家，我们废了一个铜螺丝帽却满不在乎，该怎么说呢？对国家财产不是应该比自己的东西更加爱惜吗？再说，我们车制的活，都是要用来征服大海大洋的，我们亲手做的部件在大海里出了毛病，那是好玩的事吗？
    对保证产品质量加强了责任心以后，我的想法也变了。从前对没干过的活只问技术等级比我高的，觉得那样“好看”一点，现在不论什么人都问了，觉得这没有什么不好看；从前只顾照图纸干活，现在对产品的用途也随时关心、打听了，因此，图纸有错误的地方，我也能发现并且主动提出来。
    我深深体会到：保证质量同完成产量并不矛盾，七年多来，因为我没出过废品和返工活，就保证准确地完成了计划，月月超额完成了任务。
    我在保证产品质量方面的具体经验是：
    一、主动地关心产品质量，不光自己保证质量，还要同造成质量低劣的现象坚决地进行斗争。
    二、干活时决不马虎大意。细心做好生产准备工作，车活时集中全部注意力。
    三、不懂就问，虚心学习，尤其是学习苏联经验，贯彻专家建议。
    四、严格遵守操作规程保安规程，爱护机器设备。
    五、搞好团结，尤其是三班团结，共同保证质量。
    下面就把这些经验大概地介绍一下。
    应该坚持斗争
    有一次，我接到三个“错汽拉杆”的任务，我检查图纸时，发现杆子脖的尺码同以前干的不一样。我想：这“错汽拉杆”是要在船上打反正车的，脖子细了抗不住。是不是图纸有毛病呢？我找检查工段长曹玉堂来研究，他也认为拉杆的脖子细了。我问他可不可以把脖子加粗，他说图纸是设计科画的，他不能决定。
    我找调度员小王，问他：“这活的尺码对吗？”
    他说：“不是有图纸吗？”
    这时候，也有同志对我说：照图纸干得了，反正设计科图纸错了，不能由咱们负责。我想：这个念头不对！图纸错了虽然不由我负责，可是产品质量低劣却是最大的浪费。这三个拉杆要车半个月，要是现在图省事不问明白，车出的活不合标准，这半个月就白费了。
    我把怀疑的地方告诉小王，他到设计科去问了回来说：“真气人！设计科的同志说，‘叫他照图纸干得了，管什么粗了细了的！’”
    我说：“照图纸干，我还不会干吗？我怕图纸错了误事才去问他们的。我看脖子细了，把我怀疑的理由告诉他；他说不细，也应该把不细的理由对我说一说。稀里糊涂的算怎么回事呢？”
    小王想了一下，说：“我再去一趟！”
    这回，设计科同志还是说：“图是照旧样子描下来的，叫他照着图干没错！”
    我想：照旧样子描下来也不敢保证没错一个数目字呀！让我到仓库去照旧样子对一下，决不能就这样稀里糊涂拉倒。小王说：“你不怕费事我也不怕费事，我去量吧！”
    这一量，才发现图纸画小了六个公分，这才提醒了设计科的同志，把图纸上的错误纠正了。
    车间的黑板报表扬了小王和我，认为对质量主动负责、坚持斗争是应该的。这件事情也教育了我，使我觉得不光自己要注意保证质量，还要注意别人，尤其要注意同自己工作有关的工序。保证质量本来就是需要大家配合的，不能只顾自己。
    同时，只要是对国家负责，无论对自己、对别人，都应该坚持斗争，什么事是对的，就应该照对的去做。有了这个决心才能保证质量。
      把心放在活上
    出废品和返工活，在很多情况下都是由于马虎大意；因此，对每件任务都要虚心谨慎，集中全部精力。
    我在没车活以前，就注意细心作好生产准备工作，最重要的是把图纸琢磨透，不懂的地方一定要问清楚。例如：一个字又像“3”，又像“5”，可不能寻思：“大概是个5吧！”我们决不能干“大概”活。有一次，我检查起锚机的图纸，这起锚机有九个台，图纸上注明总长是二十多公尺，可是图纸上只有六个台有尺码，我不能说：“先下料再说，反正总长有了。”也不能说：“先车这六个台再说，反正车完不是一天半天的事，一面车一面问。”根据我的习惯，一定要先把图纸全部彻底弄明白。这时我先找工学技师弄清了这三个台的尺码。这才发现把这九个台的尺码加起来，同图纸上的总长不符合。再把设计科的同志找来计算，才知道图纸的总长少写了六百公分。要是先下料，先车了再问，那不糟了吗？
    对工卡具、原料的检查也是这样。例如：千分尺、千分表大家都使，有时弄得不灵了，一定要对
  一下，事先把毛病纠正过来。
    在工作时间集中全部精力，这已经成为我的习惯了。和爱人吵架啦，孩子怎么样啦……这些事是不能带到现场里来的，带到现场来，精神准溜号，质量就没有保证。
    有时候，现场的事也会使人精神不能集中在生产上面。这时候也需要克制自己。例如：一批活的工时定额下来了，你一看，工时少算了，眼看就要少得计件工资，怎么办呢？我就遇到过这样的事。我的办法是先不去管它，一心一意干活，完了再说。有的同志看到工时定额少了，就马上去交涉，要求改正，跑来跑去，工时改过来了，但他的时间也赔进去了。回到床子旁边，还要同人家说一说，说算定额的怎么怎么不对，心一时静不下去，对保证质量很不利。
    不能以为干粗拉活就可以不太细心。废活不出在精密活上，倒常常出在粗拉活上。我们组有个工人制造船上的“小摆”，头一批十来个活车销眼时，他都用样板比量，质量非常好。过了十来天，他又作这个活了，作二十个却废了六个；因为他以为有了经验，不必比量了。那时候，我作小摆的轴，做了三百五十个没出一个废品，因为我每个都是用样板比量着干的。
    小心谨慎是不要蛮干，但不是束手束脚不敢发挥积极性创造性。在保证质量的基础上摸准了规律，就可以稳稳当当地提高产量。例如：我干一批“艉轴”时，第一个用了三十九个工，第二个是三十二个半工，最后只用了二十一个工。因为我知道怎么干能保证质量以后，就慢慢地把机床由每分钟十四转加到二十一转、三十六转，到转数不能再快的时候，又加大走刀的速度，加大吃刀的深度。去年我完成工时定额百分之二百零八，今年上半年的工时定额，我又提前两个月完成了。
    不断提高技术
    要提高质量、全面完成任务，需要不断地提高技术，向人家虚心学习。我只要遇到以前没有干过的活，就一定尽量找干过的人请教。有一次做发电机上的铜头，过去没有干过。那时张连德还刚满徒，我知道他常干这个活，就去向他请教。小张把这活的用途、车法、他车的经验都详细地告诉了我。我照他的话加工了头一个活，又拿去请他检查。他仔细看了以后，说：“保证能行！”我才继续干下去。这就避免了走弯路，保证了质量。
    对先进经验也不能放松。高速切削、多刀多刃，我都是在大连造船公司学会的；科列索夫车刀法是我用业余时间对着报纸“蹩”会的。
    我特别重视学习苏联经验、贯彻专家建议，这是提高技术的最近便的路。例如，我们车的“曲拐”老容易发扁，修起来很费事，我就去找苏联专家问这个问题。苏联专家尤金看见我主动找他提出问题，非常高兴，立刻教给了我们一个办法。我们按照这个办法做了以后，车出的活很精确，过去车一个大曲拐需要十五昼夜，现在只要十天多一点就干完了。
    最起码的要求
    遵守劳动纪律，是一件起码应该做到的事，不遵守劳动纪律，活计一定干不好。
    遵守劳动纪律，首先要遵守技术操作规程和保安规程，不遵守它就不能保证质量。我们车间有的人不认真遵守操作规程，结果出了废品和返修活，这就明明不是技术问题了。为什么不遵守操作规程呢？不是马虎大意，就是图省事，既要不费劲，又要多拿计件工资。可是这样对国家对个人都不利。例如：认真遵守操作规程，一天做了八个活，都保证了质量；不遵守操作规程，一天做十个，却废了五个，到底是哪样好呢？如果出了返修品，比重新干还要麻烦。有的人图“省事”，不遵守操作规程，只想闯大运，这是危险的。例如：卡盘爪上的螺丝不全部上紧，车活的时候，活就会飞出来，今年在我们车间已经砸伤过两个人了。铁末沾活时不用钩子钩掉，用手去摸，有人就轧去了手指。这七年半来，我一次事故也没有出过，就是因为遵守了操作规程。
    遵守劳动纪律的人，一定不会无故缺勤。这七年半时间，我不但没有旷过工，就是连一次事假也没有请过。
    这七年多来，要说“私事”，哪能没有呢？不过看你怎样处理罢了。我十三岁就离开浙江，有二十多年没有回家，我父亲要我回家看一趟。我想：趁春节多请上几天假，领导上也会照顾的。可是，我们车间是“一个萝卜一个坑”，没有闲人，我一去十天半个月的，我的活交给谁干啊！想来想去，完成国家任务是大事，我把钱寄给父亲，请他老人家上东北来玩玩。父亲还挺“硬实”，赶到大连来了。后来我爱人和我那五岁的小男孩又到浙江老家去了一趟。这样，老人家也放心了。
    再举两个例子来说吧：我三十多岁才结婚，第一个男孩满周岁的时候，亲戚朋友都替我高兴。赶巧那天不放假，我爱人叫我请一天事假帮助照料客人，我不愿请假，她生气了，说：“工厂一天少了你又能怎样？”我只好先说服她，我说工厂不比农村，一天少了我，任务就要受影响。在家招待客人虽然是愉快的事，但是影响完成任务却又会不愉快了。我们约好：请主要的亲友晚走一步。一下班，领导上就叫我回来了，亲友们都还没走。生产任务也完成了，同亲友也聚会了，这种愉快就是全面的了。
    还有一次，我的大女儿得肺病，我的爱人不知道中苏医院在什么地方，我早晨四点钟就起来，送她们到中苏医院，还是没有耽误上班。像这类的事，你计划不好，总难免请上半天一天事假，一计划好，事假就避免了。
    最后，我想特别说一说关于爱护机器设备的问题。
    七年多以来，我只使过三个月的苏联机床，其余的时间使的是两台比我年龄还大的旧皮带床子。我干的活，公差不能超过三道（一道约等于一根头发的八分之一），但是我都严格地保证了质量。这里一个重要的原因就是我注意保养机床。我绝对不让铁末子沾到床面上，交接班时也要把床子情况详细交代，决不马虎。
    为了保证质量，完成任务，这些都是我们起码应该做到的。
    靠大家的力量
    车大型的活，是三班接着干的。所以搞好三班团结，对保证产品质量特别重要。
    不出废品是大家的心愿，这就要三班密切合作，不能抱着“谁废谁负责”的态度。例如：我同卢恒珍、苏兆文三个人的技术等级是七级、六级、四级，一般地说，技术等级高一点的，干精密活也比较有把握一些，我就尽量挑精密的地方干，把不需要十分精密的地方留下。这样，每个人都可以充分发挥工作能力，还可以保证产品质量。
    三班团结得好不好，首先要看交接班做得怎样。我们对交接班是很注意的。有一次，我该下午四点半交班，老卢到时却没有来接班，我边干边等，到五点钟，老卢气呼呼地跑来了。原来他爱打篮球，这次看球忘记时间了。他来晚了，我也不能急急忙忙就走。还是按照我们的老规矩：对接班人作详细、明确的交代，不光图纸上的问题要说详细，连机床什么时候浇油都说清楚，以免你上来一壶油，我上来一壶油，造成浪费。洗过手，再回到床子旁边问接班人有什么问题，他说没有问题了，才回家。
    有时候，接班人说没有问题了，可能还会有事忘了交代。有一次我磨好刀后怕别人乱拿，就藏起来了，接班的也不知道。我回家时，总觉得还有点事。到家还没坐稳，记起来了，饭也不吃，马上又往工厂跑。只有把应交代的都交代好了，才能保证产品质量。
    老卢说得好：“要想搞好三班团结，就要各人不抱私心，大家都为产品质量着想，为完成任务着想。”这句话是顶有道理的，我们什么事情都商量着办，一商量准通，因为各人都不想占小便宜，都不抱私心。我们在大型工段的旧皮带车床工作时，就是这样共同消灭了废品。
    最后我要总的说一句：这七年多来，要是没有党的教育和群众的力量，我是不能保准提高质量，不能保准消灭废品和返工活的。这应该说是保证质量的一条最根本的体会。
