　　Goa is an inseparable piece of land on the west coast of India. It is one of Portugal's colonies in India. Portugal is the only country that still maintains colonial rule on Indian territory. Its possessions in India include Goa, Daman, and Diu, with a total area of 3,300 square kilometers and a population of 638,000 according to the 1951 census. Among these three places, Goa has the largest area, with a population of 550,000.
　　The people of Goa are Indians, and their language is a type of Indian language. Historically, Goa has always been Indian territory. It was not until the early 16th century that the Portuguese seized Goa from India and established colonial rule there.
　　For over four hundred years, the Portuguese colonialists have maintained their rule over Goa with fire and sword. However, Goa's patriots have never ceased their struggle against colonial rule. For example, the Nannes people, belonging to India's Rajput caste, repeatedly raised the banner of rebellion in Goa's Sattari region in the latter half of the 19th century and the early 20th century. As late as 1912, the Portuguese colonial authorities were still brutally suppressing the Nannes people's uprising.
　　The struggle of the Goan people is part of India's national independence movement. The pioneer of the Goan national movement, Menezes Braganza, declared on behalf of the Goan people even before World War I that Goa would never abandon its tradition of fighting for freedom and its desire for a unified and free India. After India gained independence from British rule, the people of Goa more actively launched a movement demanding merger with the Indian Federation. The Indian people also put forward the demand to eliminate the remnants of colonialism and reclaim Goa. In 1950, the Indian government formally submitted a note to the Portuguese government, requesting Portugal to transfer its possessions in India to the Indian Federation. Since then, India has repeatedly sought a reasonable solution to the Goa issue through diplomatic channels. At the same time, Indian volunteers have continuously entered Goa to launch a movement to win Goa's return to India.
　　However, the Portuguese government flatly rejected India's legitimate demand to reclaim Goa, and even refused to negotiate with the Indian government on the Goa issue. The Portuguese government described the land it had seized from India as its own territory, and described the just demands of the Indian government and people for Goa as "infringement of Portuguese sovereignty," and threatened to use war to maintain colonial rule.
　　Indian public opinion pointed out that the reason why the Portuguese authorities dared to be so unscrupulous in insisting on their colonial rule in Goa was because they relied on the support of the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization headed by the United States. Portugal, as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, once declared that Goa was land "within the scope of the North Atlantic Alliance" and could receive the "protection" of this organization. Portugal also signed a "Mutual Assistance and Defense Treaty" with the United States in Lisbon in January 1951. Portugal has been continuously transporting weapons obtained from the United States under this treaty to Goa to suppress the Goan liberation movement. The United States, on the other hand, is attempting to use this treaty to turn Goa into its military base.
　　Indian Prime Minister Nehru pointed out when debating the Goa issue in the People's House of the Indian Parliament on July 25 this year that Goa is not only a stronghold occupied by Portugal in India, but also a stronghold of many countries, many allies. This is a possible danger in the future. Nehru said that for the sake of national unity and security, India cannot allow foreign countries to occupy strongholds in India.
　　In recent months, the Indian people have successively sent volunteers into Goa to hold demonstrations demanding the liberation of Goa. On August 15, India's Independence Day, thousands of Indian volunteers entered Goa, Daman, and Diu respectively. The Portuguese authorities used automatic weapons and batons to launch a bloody attack on these unarmed volunteers, resulting in more than 200 deaths and injuries. On the same day, the people within Goa, despite the Portuguese authorities' strict suppression, also held large-scale demonstrations demanding the merger of Goa into the Indian Federation.
　　The Portuguese authorities' atrocities aroused even greater anger among the people of India. Many cities in India held strikes and demonstrations. The Indian government has also taken measures such as closing the Consulate General in Goa and requiring Portugal to close its consulates in various parts of India.
　　The Indian people's just struggle to reclaim Goa has won the sympathy and support of the people of Asia and the world. The Asian Countries Conference held in New Delhi in April this year passed a resolution demanding that the Portuguese government return Goa to the Indian Federation. The World Peace Congress held in Helsinki not long ago also demanded in its adopted proposal the elimination of the phenomenon of artificially dividing the Indian territory of Goa. The Beijing People's Support India's Reclamation of Goa Conference held on August 23 said in a telegram to Indian Prime Minister Nehru: The Indian people and the Indian Republic government's struggle to reclaim Goa is just, and it is supported and assisted by the Chinese people and the people of Asia and the world, and it will surely be victorious!

### 果阿——印度领土不可分割的一部分

　　果阿——印度领土不可分割的一部分
    果阿是印度西海岸不可分割的一块土地。它是葡萄牙在印度的属地之一。葡萄牙是直到现在还在印度领土上保持殖民统治的唯一的国家，它在印度的属地包括果阿、达曼和第乌，面积共三千三百平方公里，据一九五一年统计，人口共六十三万八千。这三个地方当中以果阿面积最大，那里的居民有五十五万人。
    果阿人是印度人，他们的语言是印度语言的一种。在历史上，果阿一向是印度的领土。直到十六世纪初期，葡萄牙人才从印度夺去了果阿，在那里建立了殖民统治。
    四百多年来，葡萄牙殖民者用火和剑维持着他们对果阿的统治。但是，果阿的爱国者从来没有停止过反对殖民统治的斗争。例如，属于印度拉杰普特族的纳内斯人就先后在十九世纪后半期和二十世纪初年连续在果阿的萨塔里举起了起义的旗帜。一直到一九一二年，葡萄牙殖民当局还在残酷地镇压纳内斯人的起义。
    果阿人民的斗争是印度民族独立运动的一部分。果阿民族运动的先驱者门尼塞斯·布拉甘查早在第一次世界大战以前就代表果阿人民声明，果阿决不放弃它的自由斗争的传统和要求一个统一和自由的印度的愿望。印度从英国统治下获得独立以后，果阿人民更加积极地展开了要求同印度联邦合并的运动。印度人民也提出了消除殖民主义残余，收回果阿的要求。一九五○年，印度政府正式递交照会给葡萄牙政府，要求葡萄牙把它在印度的属地移交印度联邦。以后，印度又一再通过外交途径谋求果阿问题的合理解决。同时，印度志愿人员不断地进入果阿，展开争取果阿归还印度的运动。
    但是，葡萄牙政府断然拒绝了印度收回果阿的合法要求，甚至拒绝同印度政府就果阿问题进行谈判。葡萄牙政府把葡萄牙从印度夺去的土地说成是自己的领土，把印度政府和人民对果阿的正义要求说成是“侵犯葡萄牙主权”，并且威胁地说要用战争来保持殖民统治。
    印度舆论指出，葡萄牙当局之所以敢于这样肆无忌惮地坚持它在果阿的殖民统治，是因为它恃有美国和以美国为首的北大西洋公约组织的支持。作为北大西洋公约组织成员国之一的葡萄牙曾经声言果阿是“北大西洋联盟范围内的”土地，可以得到这个组织的“保护”。葡萄牙还在一九五一年一月在里斯本同美国签订了“互助和防御条约”。葡萄牙把它根据这个条约从美国所得到的武器源源运到果阿来镇压果阿解放运动。美国则企图利用这个条约把果阿变为它的军事基地。
    印度总理尼赫鲁今年七月二十五日在印度国会人民院辩论果阿问题时发言指出，果阿不仅是葡萄牙在印度占有的据点，而且是许多国家，许多盟国的据点。这是将来可能的危险。尼赫鲁说，为了国家的统一和安全，印度不能容许外国在印度占有据点。
    最近几个月以来，印度人民又陆续派遣了志愿人员进入果阿，举行要求解放果阿的示威。在八月十五日印度独立纪念日，几千个印度志愿人员分别进入了果阿、达曼和第乌。葡萄牙当局用自动武器和警棍对这些赤手空拳的志愿人员进行了血腥的攻击，结果打死打伤二百多人。同一天，果阿境内的人民不顾葡萄牙当局的严厉镇压，也举行了大规模的示威，要求把果阿归并入印度联邦。
    葡萄牙当局的暴行激起了全印度人民更大的愤怒。印度许多城市举行了罢市和示威。印度政府也采取了关闭驻果阿总领事馆和要求葡萄牙关闭驻印度各地领事馆等措施。
    印度人民争取收回果阿的正义斗争得到亚洲和全世界人民的同情和支持。今年四月间在新德里举行的亚洲国家会议曾经通过决议，要求葡萄牙政府把果阿交还印度联邦。不久以前在赫尔辛基举行的世界和平大会也在通过的建议中要求消除人为的割裂印度领土果阿的现象。八月二十三日举行的北京各界人民支援印度人民收复果阿大会在给印度总理尼赫鲁的电报中说：印度人民和印度共和国政府要求收复果阿的斗争是正义的，它受到中国人民和亚洲以及全世界人民的同情与支援，它将一定获得胜利！　　（新华社）
