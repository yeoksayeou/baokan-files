    Heroic Ship that Conquered the Typhoon
    By our reporter Ai Ling
    Summer and autumn are typhoon seasons. It is very dangerous for ships at sea to encounter typhoons. However, the crew of the Nan Hai No. 163 vessel twice overcame typhoon attacks. The following is the situation of their first victory over the typhoon.
    On October 31, 1953, the sea was very calm, the air was a little dull, and there was a halo around the sun. The Nan Hai No. 163 vessel, which was arriving in Haikou City, Hainan Island, from Guangzhou, received a typhoon warning while unloading cargo. The crew quickly lowered the cargo booms, padded the gasoline-filled barrels with wooden boards, and then moved the ship to a deeper bay to prevent it from running aground. An inspection team composed of the ship's leading staff members inspected the entire ship. All this was done, but the typhoon had not yet arrived. Captain Gu Yuansong understood the laws of ocean climate change and knew that the typhoon was certain to come. Therefore, after reminding everyone not to be careless at a temporarily convened meeting of all crew members, he ordered a continued detailed inspection of the anchor chains and began anchor watch (on duty to watch the anchor chains). The waves slapped against the hull. The crew felt that one anchor chain was not safe, so they changed to two figure-eight anchor chains to nail the ship to the sea. That night, all the crew members were working nervously, preparing to meet the battle.
    At dawn the next day, the typhoon roared, and the huge waves interwoven with heavy rain and wind rolled over the bow and deck like ten thousand horses galloping. The ship was bumping so much that people could not stand still, and it was difficult to hear speech. On the bridge, the captain heard the two anchor chains clanging in the waves and thought: If the anchor chains cannot withstand the impact of the huge waves, the ship will be blown away by the wind. So, he immediately ordered the engine to be set to maximum speed to fight the typhoon head-on. But this was a category 12 typhoon, and the huge waves it stirred up were like a group of ferocious beasts, trying to devour everything in the sea. Therefore, even with full power against the wind, the ship still moved backwards by four-tenths of a nautical mile.
    The crew had never experienced such a dangerous situation, nor had Captain Gu Yuansong. "Can you allow the people's property to suffer losses?" "Of course not." Captain Gu Yuansong asked and answered himself in his mind. He calmly gripped his binoculars and stared ahead. Suddenly, he noticed a blurry dark shadow in front of him, flying towards his ship like an arrow. He immediately judged: that was a ship that had been blown away by the typhoon, and if it hit them, his ship and cargo would be finished. He immediately issued the order: "Right rudder!" The helmsman gripped the rudder tightly and turned it sharply to the right, and the ship immediately tilted as if it was about to roll into the sea. In that instant, the ship that had been blown away by the typhoon flashed past.
    Giant waves, dozens of meters high and shaped like "pyramids," crashed against the ship one after another. The bridge was surrounded by seawater and torrential rain stirred up by the wind and waves. The captain was still standing on the lookout, looking out through the glass, but he could not even see the bow. The ship was completely trapped in the wind and waves, as if it was being thrown into the air and then dropped.
    The situation was so critical that political instructor Zhao Pizhou, who came from a military background, asked and answered himself: "If I can defeat enemies on land, can't I defeat typhoons?" "The Party gave me the task and also gave me the method, which is to unite and rely on the masses." He went to every comrade, comforting and encouraging everyone. His calmness gave everyone more confidence in overcoming the typhoon.
    Zhao Pizhou went to the engine room and saw first fireman Zhou Furong comforting second fireman Liu Changan while watching the color of the fire in the furnace. Carpenter Li Jinlin walked up to Zhao Pizhou and asked to work as a sailor as well. Zhao Pizhou saw that the crew had a full fighting spirit, but he was afraid that the comrades would be careless, so he pointed out the shortcomings he had seen in the previous course and then said: "The typhoon is not terrible, what is terrible is that everyone is not united and does not abide by discipline in times of danger!" Finally, he raised his voice and said: "Comrades! In order to protect the people's property, we must use our brains, think of ways, and meet the most difficult test!"
    The crew's strong fighting spirit was once again encouraged, and they put forward many rationalization proposals:
    "Increase the weight of the aft hold; move the forward hold water pump to the aft hold so that the propeller is pressed into the water to rotate!"
    "………”
    The captain adopted every beneficial suggestion and took many effective emergency measures.
    People were always concerned about the safety of the anchor chains and the barrels of gasoline in the hold. The captain selected people to re-inspect the hold. Carpenter Li Jinlin replaced the sailor at the hatch. When he found that a corner of the canvas cover of the hatch was blown open by the wind, everyone scrambled to rescue it, even the old sailors who were older and weaker.
    Giant waves rolled over the deck one after another, making it impossible to even lift one's head. To move on the deck, one had to hold tightly to the rope and crawl forward. Sometimes, a huge wave would knock people back a few steps, and sometimes it would knock people unconscious. Even so, the crew had to crawl to where they needed to go. Sailor Jiang Shuqi had to crawl to the farther bow to see if the anchor chains were safe, and he was knocked back several times by the waves, and his hands turned purple. But he finally climbed to the bow. He hugged the small flagpole at the bow, as excited as if he was the first to occupy the high ground in battle. He leaned over to check the anchor chain, and huge waves rolled in from the side, making his ears ring. When he thought that the safety of the anchor chain had a decisive meaning for the fate of the ship, he could not care about the attack of the huge waves and leaned down repeatedly to accurately watch the anchor chain. In this way, he kept holding the small flagpole, letting the huge waves crash against him, and persevered for several hours.
    The typhoon finally passed, and the sea returned to its usual tranquility. However, except for the Nan Hai No. 163 vessel, which was still safely moored in its original bay, the seven or eight ships as large as the Nan Hai No. 163 vessel that were originally moored here were all gone. They looked everywhere and found that some had dragged their anchors and been blown onto the reefs by the typhoon, some had run aground, and some had broken down and could not move. From then on, everyone called the Nan Hai No. 163 vessel the heroic ship that conquered the typhoon.

### 战胜台风的英雄船

    战胜台风的英雄船
    本报记者　艾玲
    夏秋两季是台风季节。轮船在海洋上，如果遇到台风的侵袭，那是很危险的。但是，南海一六三号轮船的船员们，却两次战胜了台风的侵袭。下面就是他们第一次战胜台风的情形。
    一九五三年十月三十一日，海面是很平静的，空气有点沉闷，太阳周围有晕环。正从广州到达海南岛海口市的南海一六三号轮船，在卸货的时候，就接到台风侵袭的警报。船员们迅速地放下吊货杆，把装满了汽油的桶用木板垫好，然后把船移到水较深的海湾上，使它不致搁浅。由船上的领导工作人员组成的一个检查组，检查了全船。这一切都做完了，台风还没到来。船长谷源松懂得海洋气候变化的规律，知道台风是一定来的。因此，他在临时召开的一个全体船员大会上提醒大家不要麻痹大意以后，又命令继续详细检查锚链，开始值锚更（值班看锚链）。风浪噼拍噼拍地打着船身。船员们认为一条锚链不安全，又改为两条八字形的锚链，把船钉在海面上。这天晚上，全船人员都在紧张地工作，准备迎接战斗。
    第二天拂晓，台风咆哮，大雨和风浪交织成的巨浪，像万马奔腾似的滚过船头上、甲板上。船颠簸得使人站不住，讲话听不清。船长在驾驶台上，听得两条锚链被海浪打得哗哗地响，心里想：要是锚链顶不住巨浪的冲撞，船就会被风卷走的。于是，他立刻命令把发动机开到最高速度，迎头同台风搏斗。但这是十二级的台风，它卷起的巨浪像一群凶恶的猛兽，要吞噬海里的一切。所以，即使开足了马力顶风，船还后移了十分之四浬。
    这种险象，船员们都没有经历过，谷源松船长也没有经历过。“你能让人民的财产遭受损失吗？”“当然不能。”谷源松船长在脑子里自问自答。他镇静地紧握望远镜，注视前方。忽然，他发现前方出现了一个模糊的黑影，像箭似地向着自己的船飞来。他立刻判定：那是一只轮船被台风卷走了，如果被它撞上，自己的船和货就都完了。他立即发出命令：“右舵！”水手紧握着舵，向右大转，船身立即倾斜得好像就要翻进大海里。就在这一霎那间，那只被台风卷走的轮船从旁边闪过去了。
    十几公尺高、像“金字塔”一样的巨浪一个接着一个冲击着轮船。驾驶台被风浪激起的海水和狂雨所包围。船长仍在了望台上站着，透过玻璃往外望，连船头也看不清。轮船像被抛上半空又掉下来似的，完全被困在风浪里。
    情况这样危急，战士出身的政治指导员赵丕周自问自答道：“我能战胜陆上敌人就不能战胜台风吗？”“党交给我的任务时也交给我办法，这办法就是团结和依靠群众。”他走到每一个同志的面前，安慰和鼓励每一个人。他的镇定，使每一个人都增加了战胜台风的信心。
    赵丕周走到机舱内，看见一级生火周福荣正在一边安慰二级生火刘长安，一边注视着炉子的火色。木匠李金林向赵丕周走来，要求兼做水手工作。赵丕周看见船员们具有饱满的战斗情绪，但他深恐同志们粗心大意，便向大家指出在刚才的一般历程中所看到的缺点，然后说：“台风并不可怕，可怕的是在危险的时候大家不团结，不守纪律！”最后，他提高嗓子说：“同志们！为了保护人民的财产，要开动脑筋，想办法，迎接最困难的考验！”
    船员们的坚强斗志再次被鼓舞起来了，提出许多合理化建议：
    “要增加后舱的重量；把前舱水泵移到后舱去，让推进器压在水里转动吧！”
    “………”
    船长采纳每一个有益的建议，采取了许多有效的紧急措施。
    人们时刻关心锚链的安全，关心舱内那一桶桶的汽油。船长选派人到舱内再作检查。木匠李金林代替水手在舱口工作。他发觉舱口的帆布盖被风刮开一角时，大家都争着去抢救，连年纪大、身体较弱的老水手也争着去。
    巨浪一个接着一个从甲板上滚过去，使人连头都抬不起来。人们在甲板上行动，必须用手紧抓住绳索向前爬行。有的时候，一个巨浪把人打得后退几步，也有的时候把人打昏了。即使这样，船员们也要爬到要去的地方去。水手姜树岐要爬到更远的船头上去，察看锚链是否安全，他被巨浪打得几次退下来，两只手被打得发紫。但他终于爬到了船头。他一手抱住船头的小旗杆，兴奋得像战斗中第一个占领制高点一样。他俯身去察看锚链，巨浪从旁边卷来，打得耳朵嗡嗡作响。他想起锚链的安全对轮船的命运有决定的意义时，就顾不了巨浪的袭击，一再俯下身去准确地看着锚链。就这样，他一直抱着小旗杆，任凭巨浪冲击，坚持了几个钟头。
    台风终于过去了，海面恢复了平时的宁静。但是，除了一六三号轮船依然安全停泊在原来的海湾以外，原来也在这里停着的像一六三号轮那样大的七、八只船都没有了，他们到处寻找，结果发现：有的走了锚，被台风刮到礁石上，有的搁了浅，也有的机器坏了不能动。从此，大家都称南海一六三号轮船是战胜台风的英雄船。
