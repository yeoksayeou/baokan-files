    A Redundant Organization

    To the Editor:

    In the No. 3 Guesthouse of the No. 1 Factory of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, there is a group of state organ workers who have nothing to do for a long time. They are members of the acceptance team stationed at Chongqing Iron and Steel Company from the Wuhan Base Material Factory of the Material Supply Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. According to the fixed establishment, this team should have seventeen people, but now it actually has fifteen.

    On June 30th, because they had nothing to do, they were again commenting on "who has how much work." Transport worker Tao Yongjiu said that material appraiser Lao Zeng did not work more than three hours a day. Lao Zeng frankly admitted this point, and then said that financial accountant Chen Zhengfu did at most five hours of work a month. Lao Chen did not deny it either. In fact, his job was only to issue salaries twice a month and send a few letters. As for Lao Tao himself? Although his title is "transport worker," the materials are actually transported by the production unit, and he is just urging them. Looking at the material acceptance work of the entire team, the amount of steel sheets accepted by the whole team each month is no more than a few hundred tons at most, and even less than one ton at the least; while the entire team can accept two to three hundred tons a day. The acceptance of other materials is similar.

    It is worth noting that according to the ordering contract between the supply and demand sides, the quantity, quality, and transportation of materials are all the responsibility of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company; even if the materials have been accepted by this team, if unqualified materials or quality or quantity errors are found after they are transported to the user unit, the Wuhan Base Material Factory will still go to Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, and this company will also be responsible for returns or compensation. In that case, the work of this acceptance team is completely dispensable. In fact, there are hundreds of units ordering goods from Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, and some order more than the Ministry of Railways, but none of them sent any acceptance teams. Why did the Ministry of Railways set up this organization?

    一个多余的机构编辑同志：
    在重庆钢铁公司第一厂第三招待所里，长期住着一群经常无公可办的国家机关工作人员。他们是铁道部材料供应局武汉基地材料厂驻重庆钢铁公司验收组的成员。这个组按定员编制是十七人，现在实有十五人。
    六月三十日这一天，他们因为无事可做又在评论“谁的工作有多少”了。运输员陶永久说材料鉴定员老曾一天不会超过三小时的工作。老曾坦白地承认了这一点，接着就说财务会计员陈正夫一个月顶多就是干五个小时的活。老陈也不否认，事实上他的工作就是一个月发两次薪金和寄几封信而已。至于老陶自己呢？职名虽然是“运输员”，实际上材料是由生产单位包运的，他不过是催促催促罢了。从整个组的材料验收工作来看，全组每个月验收的钢钣，多的时候不过几百吨，少的时候甚至连一吨也没有；而全组人员一天就可以验收二、三百吨。其他材料的验收工作情况也相类似。
    值得注意的是，根据供需双方订货合同的规定，材料的数量、质量和运输，全由重庆钢铁公司负责；就是经过这个组验收了的材料，运到用料单位后如果发现不合格或质量、数量有差错，武汉基地材料厂还是找重庆钢铁公司，这个公司也要负责退换或补偿。既然如此，这个验收组的工作根本是可有可无的。事实上，向重庆钢铁公司订货的有上百个单位，订货数量比铁道部多的也有，但是谁也没有派什么验收组。铁道部为什么要设置这个机构呢？一川
