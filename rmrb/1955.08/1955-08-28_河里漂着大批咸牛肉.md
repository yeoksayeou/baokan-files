To the Editor:

    One morning in June, residents of Hexi in the Arxan Forest Area of Inner Mongolia were busily crossing the river when someone noticed many objects resembling chunks of meat floating in the water. Upon closer inspection, they turned out to be corned beef. News of this spread quickly, and people nearby gathered in groups of three to five along the river to search. Surprisingly, the amount of beef in the river increased, with some even being found in baskets. As a result, the residents of Hexi ate beef that day, and some even dried cooked beef jerky.

    Who threw this beef into the river? The story is as follows: The Arxan Forest Area Supplier Store of the China Native Produce Company's Ulanhot Branch purchased 440 head of live cattle in the first and second quarters of this year. Due to the cattle's weak condition, coupled with the cold climate in the forest area and poor feeding practices, 59 head died. The supplier store slaughtered some of the cattle that were about to die, sold some of the beef cheaply, and cooked and pickled the remaining 600-plus catties of beef, storing it in baskets for future sale. However, the store's employees later forgot about this batch of goods. By mid-June, when the weather warmed up, they remembered the "beef." Upon opening the baskets, they found that the beef had already gone bad. Therefore, they used carts at night to haul the beef to the riverbank and pushed it, baskets and all, into the water.

    The people of the Arxan Forest Area are very dissatisfied with the supplier store's work attitude and hope that the store will conduct a self-criticism.

### 河里漂着大批咸牛肉

　　河里漂着大批咸牛肉编辑同志：
    六月的一个早晨，内蒙古阿尔山林区河西的居民正在忙碌地往来渡河，忽然有人发现河水中漂着很多好像肉块的东西。捞起来一看，果然是咸牛肉。这事一传开去，附近的人就三五成群地沿着河寻找。出人意外的是河水中的牛肉越来越多，不光是成块的，而且有成篓的。结果，这一天河西的居民都吃到了牛肉，有的人还晒了熟牛肉干。
    是谁把这些牛肉扔在河里的呢？事情原来是这样的：中国土产公司乌兰浩特支公司阿尔山林区供应商店今年一、二季度先后购进四百四十头活牛。因为牛的体质瘦弱，加上林区气候寒冷，饲养不善，先后死了五十九头。供应商店当时宰了一部分将要断气的牛，把一部分牛肉廉价出售，剩下来的六百多斤牛肉就煮熟后腌起来，装在篓里，准备以后出售。可是商店的职工后来就把这批货物忘了，到六月中旬，天气暖了，他们才想起了这批“牛肉”。打开篓子一看，牛肉已经有味了。于是，他们就在夜里用大车把牛肉拉到河边，连篓带肉一起推下水去。
    阿尔山林区的人们对于供应商店的这种工作态度十分不满。希望这个商店进行检讨。
