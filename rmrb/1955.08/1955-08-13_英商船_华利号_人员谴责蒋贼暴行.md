Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 9th: According to a report in the Hong Kong "Wen Wei Po" on August 8th, the British merchant ship "Wah Lee," which was attacked by Chiang Kai-shek's planes near Fuzhou for the second time on the 3rd, returned to Hong Kong on the 7th. The British Chief Mate of the ship, Fox, angrily denounced Chiang Kai-shek's atrocities to Hong Kong reporters on the 7th. He said: "We are peace-loving people. If we are subjected to such brutal attacks as a result - and this time it was a truly brutal attack - we will still insist on free trade. No brutal attacks can intimidate us."

Captain Sloan of the "Wah Lee" said that the attack was sudden and that there were as many as sixty or seventy bullet holes in the ship from the strafing by Chiang Kai-shek's planes.

The "Wah Lee's" second mate and a sailor were injured. Chiang Kai-shek's planes also dropped four bombs.
