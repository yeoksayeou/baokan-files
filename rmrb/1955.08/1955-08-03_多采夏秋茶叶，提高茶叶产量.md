Pluck More Summer and Autumn Tea to Increase Tea Production
Shen Qizhu, Gao Linyi

Last winter and this spring, tea trees in various regions suffered varying degrees of frost damage. At the same time, some tea gardens also suffered from drought and insect pests. This not only affected this year's tea production but also brought certain difficulties to future tea production increase efforts. Therefore, how to tap potential, actively increase tea production, and meet domestic and international needs for tea is currently an urgent task in tea production work.

To increase tea production, the main thing is to cultivate tea trees well so that they can grow more leaves for us to pick. At the same time, pay attention to improving picking techniques, appropriately increasing the number of picking times, and extending the picking time. At present, most tea areas in China only pick spring tea and summer tea, and a few areas only pick spring tea once. Generally, tea gardens produce only forty to fifty jin of tea per mu, and the yield is very low. Judging from the climatic conditions in China's tea areas, the budding and growing time of tea trees in southern provinces can reach nine to ten months, and in general areas it reaches about seven months. The Longjing tea area in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, can pick tea four times a year, with the picking time extending from the end of March to the beginning of September. The average annual yield reaches more than one hundred jin, and the yield of high-yielding tea gardens has reached three hundred and seventy jin. The natural conditions in the Soviet tea areas are not as good as ours, but due to the good fertilization and management of the tea gardens, they can be picked three times a year, with the picking time extending from April and May to October, and the yield per unit area is also very high. From this, it can be seen that strengthening fertilization management, appropriately extending the picking time, and picking more summer and autumn tea is entirely possible.

In the Anhui tea area, there is a popular saying: "One dan of spring tea, half a dan of summer tea." This means that the yield of summer tea should account for 50% of the spring tea. However, the summer tea production situation in the country is very unbalanced, and most areas have summer tea production that does not reach 30% of the spring tea. Facts have proved that if tea garden management is strengthened and picking methods are improved, then one dan of spring tea will yield more than half a dan of summer tea. In nine counties in Zhejiang, including Changxing, Dongyang, Shaoxing, and Pingyang, the picking of summer tea accounts for 64% of spring tea. The Fujian Fu'an Tea Industry Experimental Station has created a new record of summer tea production exceeding spring tea production due to its good fertilization work in the tea gardens. At the same time, it is also necessary to expand autumn tea production in a planned and step-by-step manner. According to statistics from ten counties in Zhejiang Province that already have the habit of picking autumn tea, such as Fuyang, Changxing, Ruian, and Zhenhai, the yield of autumn tea in previous years accounted for 51% of spring tea, but in counties such as Shengxian, Jiande, Chun'an, and Shaoxing, it only reached 1% of spring tea. According to the experience of Zhejiang Province, tea trees growing on low mountains, sunny slopes, fertile soil, and with strong tree vigor can all be used for picking autumn tea. Therefore, grasping summer and autumn tea production can increase tea production.

To increase or pick more summer and autumn tea, it is necessary to do a good job in fertilization management of tea gardens. Before summer and autumn tea picking, the soil should be loosened by weeding and fertilizing with quick-acting fertilizers to ensure that the tea garden soil is loose and has sufficient nutrients and moisture, promoting the germination and growth of new tea buds. Doing these tasks well will not only enable more summer and autumn tea to be picked, but also will not affect the yield in the second year. Improving tea picking methods is also a very important task. Because the tender leaves available for picking are closely related to the life activities of the tea tree itself, and unreasonable picking will directly affect the growth and development of the tea tree. The timely picking, batch picking, and fish leaf retention and leaf picking methods currently being promoted in various regions can play a beneficial role in improving yield and quality, maintaining tea trees, extending picking time, and increasing the number of picking times.

The summer and autumn tea picking and manufacturing season is also the busy farming season. Various production tasks are heavy, and there is generally a shortage of labor in tea areas. At the same time, it is believed that summer and autumn tea has low yield and poor quality, and labor is expensive during the busy farming season. Tea farmers are not very interested in picking and manufacturing summer and autumn tea. In response to these situations, the leading organs in tea areas should strengthen the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, do a good job in the allocation and organization of labor, help tea farmers solve the problem of labor shortage, and at the same time strengthen the purchase of summer and autumn tea, improve the enthusiasm of tea farmers to pick summer and autumn tea, and strive to pick more summer and autumn tea to increase tea production.

    多采夏秋茶叶，提高茶叶产量
    沈其铸　高麟溢
    去冬今春各地茶树遭受了不同程度的冻害。同时还有些地区茶园遭受了旱灾和虫灾。这就不仅影响了今年的茶叶生产，而且给今后的茶叶增产工作也带来了一定的困难。因此如何发掘潜力，积极增加茶叶产量，满足国内外对茶叶的需要，这是目前茶叶生产工作中的一项紧迫任务。
    要增加茶叶产量，主要的应当是培养好茶树，使它能够多生出些叶子来供我们采摘；同时注意改进采摘技术，适当增加采摘次数，延长采摘时间。目前我国大部分茶区只采摘春茶和夏茶，有少数地区还只采摘一次春茶。一般茶园每亩只产茶叶四、五十斤，产量很低。从我国茶区气候条件来看，茶树抽芽生长时间南方各省可以达九到十个月，一般地区也达七个月左右。浙江杭州龙井茶区每年能采茶四次，采摘时间由三月底一直到九月上旬，每年平均产量达一百斤以上，丰产茶园的产量有的达到了三百七十斤。苏联茶区自然条件没有我们好，但由于茶园的肥培管理好，每年能采三次，采摘时间从四、五月一直延续到十月，单位面积产量也很高。由此可见，加强肥培管理，适当延长采摘时间，多采夏秋茶是完全可能的。
    安徽茶区流行着这样一句农谚：“春茶一担，夏茶一头（半担）。”这就是说夏茶产量要占春茶的百分之五十。但全国的夏茶生产情况很不平衡，大部地区夏茶生产还达不到春茶的百分之三十。事实证明，如果加强茶园管理，改进采摘方法，那末春茶一担，夏茶就不止一头了。浙江长兴、东阳、绍兴、平阳等九个县，夏茶的采摘占春茶的百分之六十四；福建福安茶业试验站由于做好了茶园的肥培工作，创造了夏茶生产超过春茶产量的新纪录。同时，有计划地有步骤地扩大秋茶生产也是十分必要的。浙江省根据已有采摘秋茶习惯的富阳、长兴、瑞安、镇海等十个县的统计，往年秋茶产量占春茶的百分之五十一，但嵊县、建德、淳安、绍兴等县却只达春茶的百分之一。根据浙江省的经验，生长在低山、阳坡、土质较肥、树势健壮的茶树，都可以采摘秋茶。因此，抓紧夏秋茶生产，是可以提高茶叶产量的。
    要增加或多采夏秋茶，必须做好茶园的肥培管理工作。在夏秋茶采摘以前，应进行中耕除草，增施速效肥料，使茶园土壤疏松，有充足的养料和水分，促进新茶芽的萌发生长。做好了这些工作，不仅能够多采夏秋茶，而且也不致影响第二年的产量。改进茶叶采摘方法也是一件十分重要的工作。因为供采摘的嫩叶对于茶树本身的生命活动，有很密切的关系，采摘不合理就会直接影响茶树的生长发育。目前各地正在推行的及时采、分批采和留鱼叶、留叶采摘方法，对产量和品质的提高，对保养茶树，延长采摘时间和增加采摘次数，都能起有益的作用。
    夏秋茶采制时期正是农忙季节，各项生产任务繁重，一般茶区劳力不足，同时又认为夏秋茶产量少，品质差，农忙工贵，茶农对采制夏秋茶的兴趣不大。针对这些情况，茶区领导机关应加强对互助合作组织的领导，做好劳动力的调配和组织工作，帮助茶农解决劳力不足问题，同时加强对夏秋茶的收购工作，提高茶农采摘夏秋茶的积极性，争取多采夏秋茶，提高茶叶产量。
