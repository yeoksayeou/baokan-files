    Shanghai's industrial, transportation, municipal, and commercial sectors have, after more than a month of repeated discussions, formulated a comprehensive conservation plan for 1955.
    According to statistics from the conservation plans of various enterprises and departments, enterprises of all economic types in the city will save over 294 million yuan in lowering production costs this year, based on last year's actual average costs. Of this, 195 million yuan will be realized in the conservation campaign to be launched in the second half of the year. Compared with this year's annual plans for state-owned and joint state-private enterprises, enterprises of various economic types will reduce production costs by over 172 million yuan this year, of which over 127 million yuan will be saved in the second half of the year. On the basis of completing this year's commodity circulation cost plan, the commercial sector will further save over 54 million yuan in commodity circulation costs and other expenses.
    In terms of reducing capital construction investment and lowering project costs, various departments plan to save another 26 million yuan in the second half of the year. In addition, industrial and commercial departments also plan to dispose of over 100 million yuan worth of stockpiled and excess reserve materials in the second half of the year. In terms of the industrial sector's cost reduction targets compared to last year's actual costs, the city's industrial production costs will be reduced by 9.2 percent in the second half of the year, resulting in an annual reduction of 7.1 percent. Regarding savings in major raw materials, the cotton consumption per yarn piece will be reduced by 4.58 liang (approximately 229 grams) compared to last year, and the tobacco consumption per carton of cigarettes will be reduced by 2 jin (approximately 1 kilogram) compared to last year. According to the summary calculation of the conservation plans of various departments (with state-owned and joint state-private enterprises based on this year's annual plans), over 1,300 tons of rubber, over 50,000 tons of coal, over 58 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, and over 1,200 liang (approximately 45 kilograms) of gold will be saved throughout the year. It is estimated that savings on just twenty major raw materials will exceed 30 million yuan annually.
    The conservation plans of most enterprises are relatively practical. In early June of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the Central Committee's instructions on practicing thrift and opposing waste, launched a mobilization to carry out a comprehensive conservation campaign, mobilizing the masses of workers to inspect waste, clear up materials, and, on the basis of summarizing and promoting advanced experiences, further tap potential and formulate preliminary plans. In state-owned enterprises, most plans went through two or three discussions and revisions, and were finally reviewed by the leading organs. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the various industrial committees strengthened supervision and inspection of this work, and promptly corrected the tendencies of complacency, conservatism, false duplication, or impracticality in planning by some enterprises.
    State-owned, local state-owned, cooperative-operated, and joint state-private enterprises account for over 70 percent of the total savings in industrial production costs in the city. The conservation plans of enterprises under the various industrial ministries of the Central Government were formulated on the basis of ensuring the completion of the annual plans recently approved by the Central Committee. For example, in the annual plan recently approved for the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, the total output value increased by approximately 63 percent compared to the original draft plan, and the cost of comparable products was required to be reduced by 17.45 percent compared to last year. This time, the plant plans to further reduce production costs by 1.08 percent on this basis. The annual plan recently approved for the Shanghai Tool Factory requires a cost reduction of nearly 11 percent (the original plan only required a reduction of approximately 3 percent). This time, the plant plans to further reduce it by 1 percent. Because the various indicators in the annual plans recently approved by the Central Committee are higher than the original plans, many enterprises have not actually fully completed the state plan in the first half of the year, and they must redouble their efforts in the second half of the year to complete the state plan and the conservation targets proposed this time.
    At present, many enterprises have already arranged the conservation targets into the August work plan, and have convened employee representative conferences to mobilize the masses to establish conservation targets for workshops, work sections, teams, and individuals, and to launch labor competitions.

### 上海各经济部门订出今年全面节约计划

    上海各经济部门订出今年全面节约计划
    上海市工业、交通运输业、市政企业和商业部门经过一个多月的反复讨论，订出了一九五五年的全面节约计划。
    根据各个企业部门节约计划统计，全市各种经济类型的企业今年在降低生产成本方面，如以去年实际平均成本为基础计算，将节约二亿九千四百多万元，其中有一亿九千五百万元将在下半年开展节约运动中实现。国营、公私合营企业以今年的年度计划为基础计算，各种经济类型的企业今年将降低生产成本一亿七千二百多万元，其中下半年节约一亿二千七百多万元。商业部门在完成今年商品流转费用计划的基础上，将再节约商品流转费用及其他费用五千四百多万元。
    在削减基本建设投资和降低工程成本方面，各部门下半年计划再节约二千六百多万元。此外，工业和商业部门还计划在下半年处理价值一亿多元的积压和超额储备的物资。工业部门降低成本的指标和去年实际成本比较，下半年全市工业生产成本将降低百分之九点二，全年将因此降低百分之七点一。其中在主要原材料的节约方面，每件纱的用棉量将比去年减少四点五八斤，每箱卷烟的用烟量将比去年减少二斤。根据各部门节约计划汇总计算（其中国营、公私合营企业以今年年度计划为基础），全年将节约橡胶一千三百多吨，煤五万多吨，电五千八百多万度，黄金一千二百多两。估计仅二十种主要原材料全年可以节约三千万元以上。
    大部分企业的节约计划订得比较实际。今年六月初，中共上海市委员会根据中央关于厉行节约、反对浪费的指示，进行了开展全面节约运动的动员，发动职工群众检查浪费、清查物资，在总结和推广先进经验的基础上，进一步挖掘潜力，制定初步计划。在国营企业中，大都经过两、三次的讨论和修改，最后还经领导机关的审核。中共上海市委员会和各产业委员会加强了对这项工作的监督和检查，及时纠正了一些企业订计划时的自满保守、虚假重复或不切实际的倾向。
    在全市工业生产成本节约总额中，国营、地方国营、合作社营和公私合营企业占百分之七十以上。中央各工业部所属企业的节约计划，是在保证完成中央最近核定的年度计划基础上制定的。如国营上海机床厂最近核定的年度计划中，生产总值比原计划草案增加约百分之六十三，可比产品成本要求比去年降低百分之十七点四五，这次这个厂计划在这一基础上再降低生产成本百分之一点零八。国营上海工具厂最近核定的年度计划，要求降低成本近百分之十一（原计划仅要求降低约百分之三），这次这个厂计划再降低百分之一。由于中央最近核定的年度计划中各项指标都比原计划高，许多企业上半年实际上没有全面完成国家计划，下半年必须加倍努力才能完成国家计划和这次提出的节约指标。
    现在，许多企业已经把节约指标安排进八月份的作业计划中，并召开职工代表大会，发动群众订立车间、工段、小组和个人节约指标，展开劳动竞赛。　（新华社）
