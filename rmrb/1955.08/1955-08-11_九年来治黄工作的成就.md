    The Yellow River is the second largest river in our country. Every year, 47 billion cubic meters of water flows into the Bohai Sea. Originating from the Yueguzonglie Canal in Qinghai Province and entering the sea at Lijin County, Shandong Province, the river has a drop of 4,368 meters over its 4,845-kilometer length, containing extremely rich water resources. However, historically, the Yellow River has not only not been utilized, but has become the river with the most severe flood disasters. According to historical records of more than 3,000 years, there have been more than 1,500 breaches and floods and 26 major course changes. Each breach and course change brought severe disasters to the people in the Yellow River basin. During the 20 years of Kuomintang rule, due to political corruption and disrepair of dikes, the Yellow River flooded for 17 years. Particularly serious was the breach of the Huayuankou Yellow River levee near Zhengzhou, Henan Province, by the Chiang Kai-shek government in 1938, which submerged 54,000 square kilometers in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, affecting 12.5 million residents. Houses and property were swallowed by the flood, millions of residents were displaced, and 890,000 people died, creating a desolate Yellow River flooded area. Our ancestors spoke of "floods and fierce beasts," but the people in the lower reaches of the Yellow River considered the Yellow River floods to be more terrifying than fierce beasts.
    I joined the Yellow River management work in 1946. At that time, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique colluded with American imperialism to launch a civil war and attack the liberated areas, attempting to rob the people of the fruits of victory in the Anti-Japanese War. In order to cooperate with the military offensive, the Kuomintang began to block Huayuankou in the spring of that year, plotting to suddenly return the Yellow River to its old course in order to submerge the liberated areas. The pseudo-Minister of Water Resources, Xue Dubi, confessed this conspiracy in his monument inscription for the damming.
    The Yellow River had not flowed through the 1,800-kilometer old course for nine years. Some levee lines were already very dilapidated, and some had almost become flat ground. Restoring this huge levee project was not an easy task. But if it was not quickly repaired, the sudden return of the Yellow River would turn the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Plain into a second flooded area. The Kuomintang's sinister ruthlessness lay here. The Communist Party of China and the People's Government of the Liberated Area, in order to protect the lives and property of millions of people, put forward the policy of preventing the Yellow River from breaching and flooding, and called on the people to fight for "defeating Chiang (Kai-shek) and the Yellow (River)." The people of the liberated areas enthusiastically responded to this call. In the war years before October 1949, every year, 300,000 to 400,000 people, along with the People's Army, Party and government workers, and Yellow River employees, bravely repaired dikes and dams, and fought floods and rescued dangers under the armed attacks, airplane bombings, and strafing of the enemy. When there was no stone, they donated the broken stone troughs, stone rollers, and stone tablets from their homes; when there were no willow branches, they cut down the trees in their yards; in the levee sections where there were no materials, they used their own bodies to block the leaks in the levee. In this way, the people held guns in one hand, protecting the fruits of land reform and the people's revolution, and stubbornly completed the task of supporting the war; in the other hand, they held shovels to complete the restoration of the levees. Under the attacks of very large floods in 1947, 1948, and especially 1949, they achieved the victory of no breaches and shattered the enemy's vicious conspiracy to flood the liberated areas. In this stage of the struggle, our Comrade Wang Hancai, the chief of the Changyuan County section, and more than 400 other cadres and people, sacrificed their lives under the enemy's massacre and bombing and strafing. They gave their lives for millions of people, and they will be immortal.
    With the victory of the people's democratic revolution, the Yellow River has been completely controlled by the people. The Party not only wants us to further strengthen the levees, but also wants us to include the fundamental plan of eradicating river hazards and developing water conservancy into the agenda of river management. This is the Yellow River management policy determined by the Communist Party of China after liberation, which takes downstream flood control as the center, while vigorously preparing for fundamental solutions.
    Under the guidance of this policy, we have reinforced 1,822 kilometers of the Yellow and Qin River levees in the lower reaches, completing a total of about 130 million cubic meters of earthwork (including 1946, 1947, and 1948), and transforming the original dilapidated levees into a strong and solid levee system. In order to protect the levees from being impacted by激涛, we used 2.6 million cubic meters of stone to transform the very fragile dike revetments built with sorghum stalks during the Kuomintang era into more than 4,800 stone dikes. During the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, when the Yellow River experienced a flood of 10,000 cubic meters per second in Shaan County, these dikes would breach and cause disasters six out of ten times. The repaired dikes can not only defend against floods of 10,000 cubic meters per second, but also against floods of 22,000 cubic meters per second.
    The frequent breaches of the Yellow River during the Kuomintang's reactionary rule were not because the floodwaters overflowed the top of the dikes, but mainly because there were hidden dangers in the dike body, and the bureaucratic river management was irresponsible, even watching the breaches and taking advantage of the damming to embezzle money. In 1949, more than 400 leaks occurred in the Yellow River levee, but they did not cause breaches due to the close defense and rescue efforts of hundreds of thousands of people. In 1950, Yellow River worker Jin Zhao responded to the Party's call and created a method of using a cone to detect cavities inside the dike body. Using this method, we probed about 60 million times in the past five years, discovered and filled 80,000 rat and badger holes, greatly increasing the strength of the levee. While eliminating hidden dangers inside the levee body, we also carried out tree planting and grass planting work. More than 14 million trees and more than 66 million clumps of grass have survived. The excellent grass species葛芭草, discovered in Puyang County, has been promoted in most levee sections, and more than 1,000 kilometers of long dikes have been greened! The masses cannot help but feel joy when they see trees and grass. They say: Planting 葛芭草 on the dike, we are not afraid of water冲浪sweeping away. Because trees and grass have been planted, the willow materials used for flood control and the fuel and fodder needed by the local people can also be partially resolved.
    "Building dikes to confine the water, using water to attack the sand" is a famous theory in our country's history of managing the Yellow River. During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, based on this theory, 缕dikes were built in the middle of remote dikes below Xuzhou, using the 缕dikes to narrow the riverbed in an attempt to攻沙. In practice, we have realized that narrowing the river in the lower section (Shouzhang to the estuary) in the lower reaches is not conducive to flood discharge and may lead to breaches; narrowing the riverbed in the upper section (Shouzhang to Zhengzhou Railway Bridge) is not only not conducive to flood discharge, but also loses the role of the wide river channel in temporarily storing floodwaters, which is incompatible with the characteristics of the Yellow River's high flood peaks, short duration, small total volume, and large amount of sediment. Therefore, we have gradually abolished the inner levee埝 (i.e., small dikes, which serve to narrow the river channel) and established large-scale flood detention areas in Dongping Lake and Changyuan County that can temporarily divert about 8,000 cubic meters per second of floodwater to strengthen the river's flood discharge capacity. These measures were all completed before 1954, and some of them have shown their effect in use.
    Relying on the above measures and the flood control organizations established by Party committees and governments at all levels over the years, especially the flood control teams of more than 300,000 people and the heroic struggle of the broad masses, we have reversed the dangerous situation of almost annual breaches in the past century, and achieved the victory of no breaches in the autumn floods for nine years, ensuring the safety of the lives and property of millions of people.
    Although we have achieved the above achievements in dike construction and flood control, we must not say that the Yellow River water damage has been eliminated. On the contrary, the Yellow River still has the danger of breaches and course changes. This is because the average amount of sediment carried downstream through Shan County reaches 1.38 billion tons every year, constantly silting up the downstream river channel and the estuary, causing the riverbed to continuously rise. Now the river滩 is 3 to 10 meters higher than the ground. The estuary siltation continues to extend, advancing more than 3 kilometers towards the sea every year in a fan shape of 40 kilometers, making the river channel slope shallower and the siltation faster. With such rapid sediment siltation, relying solely on dike construction to compete with the rising riverbed cannot solve the flood disaster problem, let alone use the Yellow River to benefit the people.
    Where does the sediment come from? When I was surveying in the loess area of Northwest China, I wrote a few sentences: "Thousands of rivers and gullies transport sediment, and the turbulent currents flow out of the mountain canyons. The upper reaches erode and the lower reaches silt up, causing water and drought disasters to harm thousands of families." This means that the main source of sediment is the erosion of the Loess Plateau. It is the root cause of the Yellow River's harm and inability to be utilized. Therefore, we must conduct a comprehensive survey and research on the Yellow River situation to prepare conditions for fundamentally controlling the Yellow River. Under the guidance of this policy, we have carried out the following tasks.
    1. In terms of hydrological work, the original 20 hydrological stations (including water level stations) with simple equipment and fewer than 100 employees have been developed into 116 stations with 500 hydrological staff, making them a hydrological network. At the same time, a large number of rain gauge stations have been added, the past hydrological data has been reorganized, and historical floods have been investigated, discovering that a flood of 36,000 cubic meters per second occurred in Shan County in 1843. We conducted sediment measurement research and basically clarified the quantity and source of sediment. In terms of surveying work, 33,605 square kilometers of topographic surveys were completed. In terms of geological drilling, 233 boreholes were drilled at dam sites. In terms of surveying, 420,000 square kilometers of surveying area were completed in the past five years. Thousands of staff and workers climbed mountains and waded through rivers, braving the severe cold and sweltering heat, from the source of the river to the estuary, from the main stream to the tributaries, their footprints almost covering the entire wilderness of the Yellow River basin. They have made valuable contributions to understanding the overall situation of the Yellow River basin. The data collected in these basic tasks are indispensable for determining the river management policy and compiling the basin plan.
    2. In order to fundamentally control the Yellow River and solve the problem of agricultural production increase in the water and soil loss area, it is necessary to stop the erosion of the loess area and maintain water and soil. This is the most fundamental method in the fundamental Yellow River control project. However, when we started this work, many people had no confidence. An engineer said: "Your water and soil conservation is like a tiger eating the sky, with no way to start." However, in the past few years, relying on the efforts of the Party committees and governments at all levels in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Shanxi provinces and the staff of water and soil conservation agencies, and relying on the development of mutual aid and cooperation, this work has achieved results. In some places, it has been achieved that water does not flow down the plateau, sediment does not leave the gullies, mountain floods become trickle flows, reducing or stopping erosion, increasing agricultural production, and providing favorable conditions for the country to prepare a water and soil conservation plan.
    3. In order to create experience for large-scale use of Yellow River water to irrigate farmland, the Central People's Government built the Yellow River Irrigation Jiwei (River) Project in Henan Province in 1951. This project was fully completed in early 1953. In addition to being able to irrigate 720,000 mu of land, it also increased the amount of water in the Wei River, greatly helping navigation from Xinxiang to Tianjin. Up to now, the benefits of irrigation and navigation have exceeded the national investment. People have changed the concept of "the Yellow River is only harmful and enriches一套" - that the Yellow River cannot be utilized. This work also provided typical experience for compiling the entire Yellow River downstream irrigation plan.
    The above tasks have, on the one hand, ensured that the area with 80 million people in the lower reaches has not suffered from the autumn floods of the Yellow River for nine years, and on the other hand, created extremely favorable conditions for the fundamental control of the Yellow River. This is a manifestation of the superiority of the new China's social system. Now the comprehensive plan for fundamentally controlling the Yellow River's water damage and developing the Yellow River's water conservancy has been approved by the National People's Congress, and large-scale work to fundamentally control the Yellow River is about to begin. As a representative of the people and a Yellow River management worker, I have indescribable excitement and joy. I believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, the cooperation of relevant departments, the support of the people of the whole country, and the strong assistance of the Soviet government, we will definitely be able to realize the Chinese people's thousands of years of desire to eliminate river hazards and develop river benefits.

    九年来治黄工作的成就
    黄河水利委员会主任　王化云
    黄河是我国的第二条大河。每年流到渤海的水有四百七十亿公方，从青海省的约古宗列渠发源，到山东省利津县入海，在四千八百四十五公里长的河流上，有落差四千三百六十八公尺，蕴藏着极为丰富的水利资源。但历史上黄河不仅没有被利用，而且成为水灾最为严重的河流。据有历史记载的三千多年中，曾发生决口泛滥一千五百多次，大改道二十六次。每一次决口、改道都给黄河流域的人民带来严重的灾祸。在国民党统治的二十年中，由于政治腐败，堤防失修，黄河竟有十七年泛滥成灾。特别严重的是一九三八年蒋介石政府在河南省郑州附近扒开了花园口黄河大堤，淹没了河南、安徽、江苏三省辖境内五万四千平方公里，受灾居民达一千二百五十万人，房屋财物尽被洪水吞没，数百万居民流离失所，死亡人口八十九万，造成了无人的黄泛区。我们的祖先说“洪水猛兽”，可是黄河下游的人民，认为黄河洪水比猛兽可怕得多。
    我是一九四六年参加治黄工作的。那时，蒋介石卖国集团勾结美帝国主义发动内战，进攻解放区，妄图劫夺人民抗日胜利的果实。为了配合军事进攻，国民党就在这一年的春天开始堵塞花园口，阴谋使黄河突然回归故道，以淹没解放区。伪水利部长薛笃弼在他的堵口碑文上明白招供了这个阴谋。
    一千八百公里长的故道，黄河已经九年不从这里走了。有的堤线已很残破，有的已几乎变成平地。恢复这一巨大的堤防工程不是一件容易事。但如果不迅速修复，黄河突然回归的时候，就将使冀鲁豫平原成为第二个黄泛区。国民党的阴狠毒辣就在这里。中国共产党和解放区人民政府，为了保障千百万人民的生命财产，提出了不准黄河决口泛滥的治河方针，号召人民为“战胜蒋（介石）黄（河）”而斗争。解放区的人民热烈地响应了这个号召，在一九四九年十月以前的战争的岁月里，每年都有三、四十万的人民和人民军队、党政工作人员、黄河职工在一起，在敌人武装袭击、飞机轰炸扫射下，英勇地修堤修坝、防汛抢险。没有石料，他们就把自己家里坏了的石槽、石滚、石碑献出来；没有柳枝，他们就把自家的树砍下来；在什么料物都没有的堤段，他们就用自己的身体堵住堤上的漏洞。就这样，人民一只手拿着枪，保护土地改革人民革命的果实，顽强地完成了支援战争的任务；一只手拿着锹，完成堤防的恢复工作。在一九四七年、一九四八年、特别是一九四九年很大的洪水袭击下，取得了没有决口的胜利，粉碎了敌人水淹解放区的恶毒阴谋。在这一阶段的斗争中，我们的长垣县段长王汉才同志和其他干部群众四百多人，牺牲在敌人的惨杀和轰炸扫射之下。他们为千百万人民献出了生命，他们将永垂不朽。
    随着人民民主革命的胜利，黄河已全部为人民所掌握。党不仅要我们进一步加强堤防，而且要我们把根除河害开发水利的治本大计列入治河的日程。这就是解放后中国共产党确定的以下游防洪为中心，同时大力准备治本的治黄方针。
    在这一方针的指导下，我们在下游培修了黄沁两河大堤一千八百二十二公里，共计完成土方约一亿三千万公方（一九四六、一九四七、一九四八年在内），把原来残破的大堤改建成一条强固的堤防。为了防护大堤免被激涛冲击，我们用了二百六十万公方石料，把国民党时代用高粱秆筑成的很不坚固的坝埽，改建成四千八百多道石坝。国民党反动统治时期，陕州每发生一万秒公方洪水时，这些堤坝十次就有六次决口成灾。经过修理以后的堤坝不仅能防御一万秒公方洪水，而且能防御两万二千秒公方洪水。
    在国民党反动统治时期黄河决口那样频繁，并不是因为大水漫过了堤顶，而主要的是堤身有隐患，官僚治河又不负责，甚至坐视决口，利用堵口贪污发财。一九四九年黄河大堤发生漏洞四百多处，由于数十万人的严密防守抢堵而没有决口。一九五零年黄河工人靳钊同志响应党的号召，创造了用锥探发现堤身内部洞穴的方法。我们用这个方法，五年来共锥探约六千万眼，发现并挖填鼠穴獾洞八万处，大大增强了堤防的强度。在消灭堤身内部隐患的同时，还进行了植树种草工作，现在已成活的树有一千四百多万株，草六千六百多万丛。在大部分堤段推行了濮县发现的优良草种葛芭草，一千多公里的长堤已经绿化了！群众看见树和草，都有止不住的喜悦。他们说：堤上种上葛芭草，不怕水冲浪来扫。因为种了树和草，防汛用的柳料和当地群众需要的燃料、饲草，也得以部分的解决。
    “筑堤束水，以水攻沙”，这是我国历史上有名的治理黄河的理论。明清两代，多根据这个理论，在徐州以下遥堤中间筑缕堤，利用缕堤束窄河床，企图攻沙。我们在实践中认识到：在下游的下段（寿张至海口）把河缩窄，就不利于排洪，还可能招致决口；在上段（寿张至郑州铁桥），缩窄河床，不仅不利于排洪，而且丧失了宽河道临时蓄滞洪水的作用，这跟黄河洪水洪峰高、时间短、总量小、泥沙多等特点，是不相适应的。因此，我们逐步废除了堤内民埝（即小堤，它起着缩窄河槽的作用），并在东平湖和长垣县建立了可以临时分出洪水约八千秒公方的大型滞洪区，以加强河道排洪的作用。这些措施都已于一九五四年前完成，部分措施已在使用中显出了它的作用。
    依靠上述措施和历年来各级党委、政府所建立的防汛组织，特别是三十多万人的防汛队伍和广大群众的英勇斗争，扭转了近百年来几乎年年决口的险恶局面，取得了九年来伏秋大汛没有决口的胜利，保证了千百万人民生命财产的安全。
    在修堤防汛方面，虽然取得了上述成就，但我们决不能说黄河水害已经消除了。相反，黄河依然有决口改道的危险。这是由于每年经过陕县带到下游的泥沙平均达十三亿八千万公吨，经常淤积下游的河道和海口，使河床不断升高。现在河滩已比地面高出三至十公尺，海口淤沙不断伸展，每年向海作四十公里的扇面形推进三公里多，使河道坡降变缓，淤积越快。泥沙淤积这样快，单靠修堤以和河身升高竞赛是不能解决水灾问题的，至于利用黄河为人民谋福利就更谈不到了。
    泥沙究竟从何处来呢？我在西北黄土区域查勘时曾写了几句话：“千河万沟输泥沙，滚滚浊流出山峡，上边冲刷下边淤，水旱灾害祸万家。”这就是说泥沙来源主要的是黄土高原的冲刷。它是黄河为害而不能利用的根源。因此我们必须对黄河情况进行全面的调查研究，为根治黄河准备条件。在这一方针指导下，我们进行了以下各项工作。
    一、在水文工作方面，把过去设备简陋，职工不满百人的二十个水文站（包括水位站）发展到有五百个水文工作人员的一百一十六个站，使之成为
  一个水文网。同时增设了大批雨量站，整编了过去的水文资料，调查了历史洪水，发现了一八四三年在陕县曾经发生过三万六千秒公方的洪水。我们进行了泥沙测验研究，基本上弄清了泥沙的数量和来源。在测量工作方面完成了地形测量三三、六○五平方公里。在地质钻探方面，完成坝址钻探二三三孔。在查勘方面，五年来完成查勘面积四十二万平方公里。数以千计的工作人员和工人，爬山涉水，冒着严寒盛暑，从河源到海口，从干流到支流，足迹几乎踏遍了整个黄河流域的原野。他们为了解黄河流域全面情况，作了宝贵的贡献。在这些基本工作中所搜集到的资料，都是确定治河方针，编定流域规划必不可少的依据。
    二、为了根治黄河和解决水土流失区的农业增产问题，必须停止黄土区域的冲刷，保持水土。这是黄河治本工程中的治本办法。但在我们开始进行这一工作时，许多人是没有信心的，有一位工程师说：“你们搞水土保持，就像老虎吃天，无法下爪。”但是，几年来，依靠陕西、甘肃、山西三省各级党委、政府和水土保持机构的职工的努力，依靠互助合作的发展，这一工作已经有了成效，在某些地方已经做到水不下塬，泥不出沟，山洪变为细水长流，减少或停止了冲刷，增加了农业生产，并且为国家编制水土保持的规划提供了有利的条件。
    三、为了给大规模地利用黄河水灌溉农田创造经验，中央人民政府一九五一年在河南省修建了引黄灌溉济卫（河）工程。这一工程已于一九五三年初全部完成，除能够灌田七十二万亩外，还增加了卫河水量，大大帮助了从新乡至天津的通航。截至目前为止，灌溉和航运的收益已经超过国家投资。人们已经改变了“黄河百害唯富一套”——黄河不能利用的观念。这一工作也为编制整个黄河下游灌溉规划提供了典型经验。
    上述各项工作，一方面保证了下游八千万人口地区九年来没有遭受黄河伏秋洪水的灾害，另一方面为黄河治本创造了极为有利的条件。这是新中国社会制度优越性的表现。现在根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划，已经全国人民代表大会通过，大规模根治黄河的工作即将展开，作为人民一个代表和治黄工作者的我，有难以形容的兴奋和喜悦。我相信在中国共产党和国务院的领导，有关部门的协作，全国人民的支援，苏联政府的大力帮助下，一定能够实现中国人民几千年来除河害兴河利的愿望。
