The exposure of the Hu Feng case and other counter-revolutionary cases has profoundly educated the people of the whole country. The broad masses of readers have sent letters unanimously expressing their determination to overcome right-leaning thoughts, enhance revolutionary vigilance, and resolutely eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements. However, in the reader letters we recently received, some phenomena of carelessness and disregard for confidentiality work were also revealed.

Some staff members of government agencies casually take classified documents to public places to read, or easily hand them over to strangers, and even lose them as a result. Reader Jia Peihua wrote: On July 4th, on the passenger train from Tianjin to Shijiazhuang, he saw a passenger sitting opposite him intently reading materials marked "Confidential" and "Top Secret." From the envelopes of these materials, it could be known that this passenger was the person in charge of the Cangxian Prefectural Oil and Fat Company in Hebei. After reading these materials, the passenger casually put them into the pocket of his uniform hanging on the coat hook and left his seat, disappearing from view. Fearing that bad people would steal the documents, the reader dared not leave and acted as a "volunteer guard" for this passenger for a long time. Reader Zhu Yaoting reported: In late July, Li Ruitang, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Central and Southern Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, took a train to Beijing for a meeting. The train encountered a flood and he got off at Jiangshan Station. He walked to the Ershili Station to the north to catch another train. On the way, he talked to two strangers and put his briefcase containing his work diary and other confidential documents into the empty shoulder pole carried by one of them. Soon, these two people disappeared, and Li Ruitang then remembered his documents. After reporting to the Qu County Public Security Bureau for investigation, the case was finally solved in time; however, the documents had been read by the bad elements who had tricked him and were then discarded in a trash can, torn and tattered.

Some government agencies do not have sound systems for the safekeeping, sorting, and destruction of internal documents, or if they have systems, they are not strictly enforced, so many documents go missing, and even thrown away as waste paper. For example, reader Guo Xiang wrote: When the First Engineering Department of the Light Industry Ministry's Engineering Company moved its office on July 2nd, some units, due to improper safekeeping of documents, actually discarded some materials related to production and personnel; fortunately, they were discovered by the Party organization and the security section and recovered. Also, the Shijiazhuang Branch of the People's Bank of China recently threw away many documents containing confidential figures and internal information as waste paper. Fortunately, they were discovered by comrades from the document group when they went to the waste paper depot to look for waste envelopes and were retrieved. More seriously, as revealed by the Nanjing Xinhua Daily, the Wuxi Municipal Public Security Bureau, a national security agency, also threw a batch of classified documents and public security materials into the outside trash can as waste paper and garbage in late June.

Another situation is that in public places, in front of everyone, people talk about internal affairs of government agencies as if no one else is around. Stalin once sarcastically said of these people: "The tongue is given to such people not to control it, but to be controlled by their own tongues, and they are unable to understand at what moment they inadvertently say something." There are still many such people now. For example, reader Zhang Woqin wrote about an incident he saw on the train from Beijing to Shanghai on June 22nd: A staff member from a central government agency and a staff member from a military unit, having just met on the train, confided in each other about the situation of their respective units, and they did not care that there were so many passengers nearby.

Strictly safeguarding state secrets is the responsibility of every citizen. "Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique" specifically tell us how counter-revolutionary elements try every means to inquire about our internal affairs and steal our classified materials in order to carry out sabotage activities; "Some liberalists are good friends of these counter-revolutionary elements." However, the facts listed above all occurred after the publication of the "Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique," and some even occurred while internal study sessions were being held within government agencies. This kind of carelessness has reached the point of being numb, which is really intolerable.

This serious situation shows that some of our comrades have not truly learned the lessons they should have from the Hu Feng case and other counter-revolutionary cases, and have not clearly recognized the sharpness and complexity of the current class struggle. It should be pointed out that raising revolutionary vigilance is by no means an empty slogan, but must be manifested in practical actions. If one only shouts slogans about raising vigilance but remains careless and treats state secrets with a careless attitude, creating opportunities for the enemy, this should be considered a serious criminal act. Therefore, it is necessary to shout loudly to those numb liberalists: Do you still want to continue to be "good friends" of counter-revolutionary elements? They must immediately wake up and resolve to overcome their own right-leaning and paralyzing thoughts, so as not to cause undue losses to the people and the revolutionary cause, and make themselves sinners against the people.

All government agencies should pay attention to this situation, educate all staff members to link their own thoughts and actions to carry out the study of raising revolutionary vigilance and eliminating all counter-revolutionary elements, and constantly strengthen education on confidentiality work. They should also establish and improve the necessary confidentiality systems, make regulations on the methods of safekeeping, sorting, and destroying internal documents, and strengthen inspections to ensure that these systems can be strictly enforced. Those staff members who are careless and cause incidents of leakage and loss of secrets must be dealt with seriously. Only in this way can all phenomena of leakage and loss of secrets be eliminated and the work of safeguarding state secrets be effectively strengthened.

### 反对用漫不经心的态度对待保密工作

    反对用漫不经心的态度对待保密工作
    胡风事件和其它反革命案件的揭露，使全国人民受到了深刻的教育。广大读者来信，一致表示要克服右倾思想，提高革命警惕，坚决肃清一切反革命分子。但是在我们最近收到的读者来信中，也揭发了一些麻痹大意、不重视保密工作的现象。
    有些机关工作人员随便把机密文件带到公共场所阅看，或者轻易交给不相识的人，甚至因而丢失了。读者贾佩华来信说：他在七月四日天津到石家庄的客车上看到坐在对面的一位旅客正在聚精会神地看着写有“机密”“绝密”字样的材料。从这些材料的信封上，可以知道这位旅客是河北沧县专区油脂公司的负责人。这位旅客把这些材料看完后，顺手放进挂在衣钩上的制服口袋里，就离开座位不知干什么去了。读者怕有坏人盗窃文件，就坐着不敢离开，替这位旅客做了好久的“义务警卫员”。读者祝尧廷反映：七月下旬，铁道部中南设计分局政治处李瑞堂副主任乘火车到北京开会，车遇大水，在江山车站下了车。他步行到北面的二十里车站去搭另一班车，路上同两个素不相识的人谈上了，就把自己放有工作日记本和其它机密文件的皮包搁进其中一个人所挑的空担里。不久这两个人走得无影无踪了，李瑞堂才想起自己的文件。经报请衢县公安局侦察，总算及时破案；但是文件已经被骗走东西的坏分子看过后丢在垃圾桶里，破损不堪了。
    有些机关对内部文件的保管、清理和销毁没有规定健全的制度，或者有了制度也没有严格执行，因而很多文件找不到下落，甚至被当成废纸扔掉了。如读者国祥来信：轻工业部工程公司第一工程处在七月二日迁移办公室时，某些单位由于没有妥善保管文件，竟把一些有关生产和人事的材料丢下了；幸被党组织和保卫科检查发现，才收拾回来。又如，中国人民银行石家庄支行最近曾把许多有机密数字和内部情况的文件当废纸扔掉了，幸而被文书组的同志到烂纸库里找废信封时发现了，才被拣回来。更严重的是，据南京新华日报揭露，无锡市公安局这样一个国家保安机关，在六月下旬竟然也把一批机密文件和公安材料当成废纸和垃圾一起扔到外面的垃圾箱里。
    还有一种情况是在公共场所之中，大庭广众之下，旁若无人地乱谈机关内部情况。斯大林曾经讽刺过这些人说：“舌头给了这种人，不是为了去支配它，而是为了自己受自己舌头的控制，自己也无能理解在什么时候就顺口说出些什么来。”这样的人在现在还可以发现不少。如读者张我勤来信反映他在六月二十二日北京到上海的火车上看到的一件事：中央某机关的一个工作人员和一个部队的工作人员，两人在车上刚认识，就互相倾谈本单位的情况，并且也毫不顾忌旁边还有那末多的旅客。
    严格地保守国家的机密，是每一个公民的责任。“关于胡风反革命集团的材料”具体地告诉我们，反革命分子为了进行破坏活动，是怎样千方百计地来探听我们的内部情况，盗窃我们的机密材料；“有些自由主义分子则是这些反革命分子的好朋友”。但是，上面举出的这些事实，都发生在“关于胡风反革命集团的材料”公布以后，有的甚至发生在机关内部正在进行学习的时候。这种麻痹大意已经到了麻木不仁的程度，实在是令人难以容忍的。
    这种严重的情况说明，我们有些同志还没有真正地从胡风事件和其它反革命案件中吸取应有的教训，还没有清醒地认识目前阶级斗争的尖锐性和复杂性。应该指出，提高革命警惕决不是一句空洞的口号，而必须表现在实际行动中。如果光是在口头上高喊提高警惕，而仍然麻痹大意，用漫不经心的态度对待国家机密，给敌人制造可乘之机，这应该被认为是一种严重的犯罪行为。因之，有必要向那些麻木不仁的自由主义分子大喝一声，难道你们还愿意继续做反革命分子的“好朋友”吗？他们必须立刻清醒过来，下决心克服自己的右倾麻痹思想，才不致于给人民和革命事业造成不应有的损失，使自己变成一个对人民的罪人。
    各机关单位应该重视这种情况，教育所有工作人员联系自己的思想和行动来进行提高革命警惕、肃清一切反革命分子的学习，并经常地加强有关保密工作的教育。还应该建立和健全应有的保密制度，对保管、清理和销毁内部文件的办法作出规定，并加强检查，保证这些制度能够严格地被执行。对于那些麻痹大意、造成泄密失密事件的工作人员，必须严肃地加以处理。只有这样，才能杜绝一切泄密失密的现象，有效地加强保守国家机密的工作。
