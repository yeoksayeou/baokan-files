Xinhua News Agency, Thirtieth. According to TASS: The Soviet Academy of Sciences' Institute of Oceanography's scientific research vessel "Vityaz" has returned to Vladivostok after a four-month voyage in the Northwest Pacific. An expedition composed of scientists carried out the world's first comprehensive study of the Aleutian Trench. They conducted hydrological, hydrochemical, marine biological, and marine geological research in the Northwest Pacific and the Kuril Islands region, and obtained many valuable materials.

　　In addition to the Aleutian Trench, scientists also comprehensively studied the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench and collected materials on the Japan Trench. According to newly obtained data, the deepest part of the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench reaches more than 10,000 meters, while it was previously thought that the deepest point was 8,500 meters. It has now been determined that the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench, in terms of its structure, is similar to other trenches extending southward from the Aleutian Islands. From this, it can be seen that along the west coast of the Pacific Ocean is a long, continuous marginal sea trough of the earth's crust.

　　The "Vityaz" expedition discovered a ridge extending from the Hawaiian Islands to the Komandorski Islands. It divides the North Pacific into two basins. The expedition also discovered some unknown seabed animals and fish. Scientific workers carried out a large amount of seabed photography work in deep water up to 2,800 meters.

　　苏联一科学研究船考察了太平洋西北部
    新华社三十日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联科学院海洋学研究所“勇士号”科学研究船，最近在太平洋西北部作了一次历时四个月的航行之后已经回到海参崴。科学家们组成的考察队对阿留申深水凹地进行了世界上第一次综合研究。他们在太平洋西北部以及千岛群岛区域进行了水文学、水文化学、水中生物学、海洋地质学等方面的研究工作，并且获得了很多宝贵的材料。
    除了阿留申深水凹地外，科学家们还全面地研究了千岛群岛—堪察加凹地，收集了关于日本凹地的材料。根据新获得的资料，千岛群岛—堪察加凹地的最深部分达一万多公尺，而从前认为最深处是八千五百公尺。现已确定，千岛群岛—堪察加凹地，按其结构来说，类似于从阿留申群岛往南伸延的其他凹地。由此可见，沿太平洋西岸是一长条连续的地壳边缘海槽。
    “勇士号”船考察队发现了一条从夏威夷群岛伸向科曼多尔斯基群岛的海脊。它把太平洋北部切成了两个盆地。考察队还发现了一些在科学上至今还不知道的海底动物和鱼类。科学工作者在深达两千八百公尺的深水中进行了大量的海底摄影工作。
