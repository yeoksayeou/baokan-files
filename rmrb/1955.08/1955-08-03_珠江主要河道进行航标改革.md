Navigation Mark Reform on Major Pearl River Waterways

Major waterways of the Pearl River system are undergoing planned navigation mark reform. This year, the Pearl River Navigation Administration plans to invest 370,000 yuan to establish 134 new-style shore marks, 235 water marks, and 47 navigation mark stations on the 294-kilometer Xijiang (West River) waterway from Yinggezui in Guangdong Province to Wuzhou City in Guangxi Province. The surveying work, including navigation mark allocation, has already been completed, and it is expected that the entire project will be finished by November this year.

The establishment of navigation marks on the major waterways of the Pearl River system only began to receive attention after liberation. However, at that time, navigation signs were only set up at the entrances and exits of bends and at dangerous reefs, and the signs suffered from shortcomings such as inconsistent specifications. From October to December 1954, navigation mark reform was first carried out on the 61-kilometer Chenrong Waterway from Chencun to Yinggezui in Guangdong Province, where 132 new Soviet-style shore marks and 130 water marks were established. Navigation mark watch stations were also established to regularly survey the waterway and promptly set up or adjust navigation marks according to changes in the riverbed and water level. After the Chenrong Waterway adopted the new Soviet-style navigation marks, accidents such as collisions, impacts, and groundings were greatly reduced due to the clear and accurate signs, well-defined channel boundaries, and the ability to travel in a straight line between the marks. Previously, only ships with a total tonnage of 300 tons could pass through this waterway, but now ships with a total tonnage of 500 tons can also pass through. (Our Correspondent in Guangzhou)

    珠江主要河道进行航标改革
    珠江水系的主要河道正在有计划地进行航标改革工作。今年珠江航运管理局计划投资三十七万元，在从广东省的莺哥嘴到广西省梧州市的二百九十四公里的西江航道上，设立新式岸标一百三十四个，水标二百三十五个，航标站四十七处。这项工程现在已经完成了航标配位等勘测工作，预计到今年十一月间将全部完成。
    在珠江水系的主要河道上建立航标的工作，是在解放以后才开始被重视的。但当时也只是在拐弯的进出口和危险的礁石处设立航行标志，而且标志存在着规格不统一等缺点。从一九五四年十月到十二月，首先在广东省内自陈村到莺哥嘴的六十一公里的陈容水道上进行了航标改革工作，设立苏联新式岸标一百三十二个、水标一百三十个，并设立航标驻守站经常探测河道，按河床的变化和水位涨落情况，及时设立或调整航标。陈容水道采用了苏联新式航标以后，由于标志明显、准确，航道界线分明，标和标间可以直线通行，触礁、碰撞和搁浅等事故大大减少。过去在这条水道上只能通行三百总吨位的船只，现在五百总吨位的船只也可以通行了。（本报驻广州记者）
