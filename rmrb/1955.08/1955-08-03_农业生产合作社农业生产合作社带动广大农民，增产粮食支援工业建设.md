    Agricultural Production Cooperatives Lead the Broad Masses of Farmers to Increase Grain Production and Support Industrial Construction
    Editor:
    From July 11th to 13th, the Fourth District of Xiangtan County held a joint meeting of the heads of the 93 agricultural production cooperatives in the district to study the autumn income distribution work and also discussed Comrade Li Fuchun’s "Report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy."

    The cooperative heads were all extremely excited about the rapid development of the motherland's industrialization and also talked about the significant role of industrial development in supporting agriculture. Su Fuquan, head of the Shaoxing Cooperative, said: "Industry's support for our agriculture is really great. Take ammonium sulfate for example, it has a great fertilizer effect, is easy to use, and wherever it's applied, the rice in that field is lush green and the price is also cheap. 666 powder is the same. This year, 20 mu of fields in Zaocun Village were infested with grasshoppers. We used a sprayer loaded with 666 to spray, and in two days they were wiped out."

    Inspired by the prospects of the First Five-Year Plan, the heads of the agricultural production cooperatives all expressed their intention to vigorously promote the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, guide farmers to take the path of collectivization, strive to achieve agricultural production increase plans, support industrial construction, and realize the First Five-Year Plan. Pang Renfeng, head of the Heping Cooperative in Qingxi Township, expressed his determination, saying: "In the first two years of the First Five-Year Plan, agricultural production did not complete the production increase plan due to disasters. The burden for the next three years is even heavier. Our agricultural cooperatives are the leaders and must ensure the completion of the production increase plan and lead the broad masses of farmers to follow." Mao Zaisui, deputy head of the Shaoshan Cooperative in Shaoshan Township, said: "The farmers in our Chairman Mao's hometown will never lag behind in participating in the construction of the motherland. This year, in addition to accumulating a large amount of local fertilizer, our cooperative also bought more than 1,100 jin of ammonium sulfate to fertilize the fields. We guarantee to increase production by 30,000 jin of grain to support industrial construction." All the agricultural cooperative heads in Shaoshan Township stated: Currently, drought is seriously threatening the seedlings, and after returning, they will immediately organize cooperative members and lead mutual aid groups and individual farmers to solve the water shortage problem by improving water storage systems, saving water, and finding mountain spring water sources.

    On July 13th, the 93 cooperative heads jointly wrote a letter to Chairman Mao and the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, proposing to overcome various natural disasters and ensure an increase of 1.46 million jin of rice; and to lead mutual aid groups and individual farmers to complete the task of increasing grain production by 5 million jin in the entire district. It is necessary to plant more high-yield crops and resolutely complete the district's planting plan of 3,000 mu of autumn sweet potatoes, 3,000 mu of potatoes, 5,000 mu of buckwheat, and 6,000 mu of rapeseed, to continuously supply the grain and raw materials needed by industry, and to strive for the realization of the First Five-Year Plan.

    农业生产合作社农业生产合作社带动广大农民，增产粮食支援工业建设编辑同志：
    七月十一日到十三日我们湘潭县第四区召开了全区九十三个农业生产合作社社长的联席会议，研究秋季收益分配工作，同时座谈了李富春同志“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”。
    社长们对祖国工业化的迅速发展都感到无比兴奋，并且谈到了发展工业对支援农业的重大作用。韶兴社社长苏福泉说：“工业对我们农业的支援真大。就拿硫酸錏来讲吧，肥效大，使用简便，放到那丘田里那里的禾就是青油油的，而且价钱也便宜。六六六粉也是一样，今年皂角村二十亩田起了蚱蜢，我们用喷雾器装上六六六一喷，两天就扑杀了。”
    为第一个五年计划远景所鼓舞的农业生产合作社社长们都表示要大力开展农业互助合作运动，引导农民走合作化道路，努力实现农业增产计划，支援工业建设，实现第一个五年计划。清溪乡和平社社长庞仁丰表示他的决心说：“第一个五年计划前两年，农业生产因为受了灾，没有完成增产计划，后三年的担子更重了，我们农业社是带头人，一定要保证完成增产计划，带动广大农民也跟着来。”韶山乡韶山社副社长毛再遂说：“我们毛主席故乡的农民，参加祖国建设决不后人。今年我们社里除了积大量土肥外，还买了一千一百多斤硫酸錏肥田。我们保证增产三万斤粮食，支援工业建设。”韶山乡的全体农业社长都表示：目前旱灾正严重地威胁着禾苗，回去后要马上组织社员，并且带动互助组和单干农民，用健全蓄水制度、节约用水和寻找山泉水源等办法，来解决缺水问题。
    七月十三日，九十三个社长共同写了一封信给毛主席和第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议，提出要战胜各种自然灾害，保证增产一百四十六万斤稻谷；并且带动互助组和单干农民，完成全区增产五百万斤粮食的任务。要多种高产作物，坚决完成全区秋红薯三千亩、马铃薯三千亩、荞麦五千亩、油菜六千亩的种植计划，源源供给工业需要的粮食和原料，为第一个五年计划的实现而奋斗。
