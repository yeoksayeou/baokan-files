Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, August 27th: The 44th Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union has been going on for three days. It is clear from the news in the local papers that the US representatives, who have been trying to obstruct the delegation of the People's Republic of China from participating in the Union, have placed themselves in a morally isolated position.

　　"Labour People's Daily" reported on the 26th that the situation on the first day of the meeting clearly showed that the majority of members of the Inter-Parliamentary Union welcomed the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic as members of the Union. However, some representatives are doing everything possible to prevent these countries from becoming members and are engaging in activities that violate the purpose of the Union. At the meeting on this day, many representatives pointed out in their speeches that it is not permissible to exclude the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic from the Union, as this violates the charter of the Union and runs counter to the Union's willingness to promote peaceful coexistence between countries with different political and social systems. Representatives from Belgium, Britain, Italy, and other countries insisted at the meeting that the Union must accept the People's Republic of China as a member. Lord Stansgate, the Chairman of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, also believed in his opening speech that obstructing China's participation was inappropriate. The newspaper pointed out that his words reflected the sentiments of the majority of the Union's members and aroused warm responses from the parliamentary delegations of Finland and Scandinavia.

　　The newspaper quoted parliamentary sources as saying that the obstacles encountered by the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic in obtaining membership of the Union were created by representatives of the ruling group of a certain Western power. They are trying to make the Union a place to promote their own policies. At the same time, some representatives who are completely dependent on this major power are also participating in this obstruction.

　　Many Helsinki newspapers have also criticized the US representatives' activities to obstruct the participation of the Chinese representatives in the Inter-Parliamentary Union. The Finnish Democratic News Agency said that it can be seen from some newspapers that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group in Taiwan is demanding to participate in the Union, but it is not clear what kind of parliamentary organization this group has in Taiwan. The Democratic News Agency pointed out that the Chiang Kai-shek group's sudden interest in the Inter-Parliamentary Union is obviously directed by foreign forces, and its purpose is to create excuses to prevent the delegation of the People's Republic of China from participating in the Union.

　　"Labour People's Daily" published an editorial on the 25th entitled "Strive for Peaceful Coexistence," pointing out that although the main agenda of the meeting is to promote peaceful coexistence, not every representative has demonstrated the spirit of peaceful coexistence. The unreasonable exclusion of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic is one proof of this. A representative of a Western country did not accept the Geneva spirit like many other representatives.

　　"New Times" said in an editorial on the 24th that the head of the US delegation declared that he could not support the participation of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic in the Union, and this attitude is neither in line with the Geneva spirit nor with the charter of the Union. The editorial called on the Executive Committee of the Union to make a decision to abide by the charter of the Union and accept the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic.

　　"Free News" expressed surprise in its editorial on the 25th at the decision of the Executive Committee of the Union to postpone the discussion of China's application. The editorial pointed out that the Union can only fulfill its mission by expanding its universality as much as possible. The editorial said that the decision to accept or reject the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic itself can explain the results of the main issue to be dealt with at the Union conference - the issue of peaceful coexistence. The editorial concluded by saying that at a time when the world's public opinion demands peace more strongly than ever before, the Union should be at the forefront of this atmosphere, not lagging behind it.

### 美国阻挠我国参加联盟的行为遭到反对

　　美国阻挠我国参加联盟的行为遭到反对
    新华社赫尔辛基二十七日电　各国议会联盟第四十四届大会已经进行了三天。从这里报纸消息中可以明显地看出，极力阻挠中华人民共和国代表团参加联盟的美国代表已使自己陷于道义上孤立的地位。
      “劳动人民报”二十六日报道，第一天会议的情况清楚地表明，各国议会联盟的大多数会员都欢迎中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国成为联盟的会员。但是也有某些代表在用尽一切办法，阻挠这些国家成为会员，并且从事于违反联盟宗旨的活动。这一天的会议上，有许多代表在发言中指出，把中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国排斥在联盟以外是不能允许的，这违背了联盟的章程，并且是和联盟表示愿意促进不同政治和社会制度国家和平共处的愿望背道而驰的。比利时、英国、意大利等国代表在这一天会议上发言时，都坚持联盟必须接受中华人民共和国为会员。各国议会联盟主席斯坦斯盖特勋爵在致开幕词时也认为阻挠中国参加是不适当的。报纸指出，他的话反映了联盟大多数会员的情绪，在芬兰和斯堪的纳维亚的各国议会代表团中引起热烈的响应。
    这家报纸引用议会方面人士的话指出，中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国在取得联盟会员资格上所受到的阻碍，是某个西方大国统治集团的代表造成的。他们企图使联盟成为推行自己政策的场所。同时，也有某些完全依赖这个大国的代表参与这种阻挠活动。
    赫尔辛基许多报纸也都抨击美国代表的阻挠中国代表参加各国议会联盟的活动。芬兰民主通讯社说，从一些报纸上可以看到，台湾蒋介石卖国集团在要求参加联盟，但是却看不到这个集团在台湾究竟有什么议会组织。民主通讯社指出，蒋介石集团对各国议会联盟突然感到兴趣，显然是受到外国势力的指使，其目的在于制造借口阻挠中华人民共和国代表团参加联盟。
    “劳动人民报”在二十五日以“争取和平共处”为题发表社论指出，虽然会议的主要议程是促进和平共处，但是并不是每一个代表都表现了和平共处的精神。中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国被无理排斥就是一个证明。一个西方国家的代表没有像其他许多代表那样接受日内瓦精神。
      “新时报”二十四日的社论说，美国代表团团长宣称他不能支持中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国参加联盟，这种态度既不符合日内瓦精神，也不符合联盟的章程。社论要求联盟执行委员会作出遵守联盟章程的决定，接纳中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国。
      “自由新闻”在二十五日的社论中对联盟执行委员会延期讨论中华人民共和国的申请的决定，表示惊异。社论指出，联盟只有尽可能扩大它的普遍性，才能完成它的使命。社论说，接受或拒绝中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国的决定本身，就能够说明联盟会议将要处理的主要问题——和平共处问题的成果如何。社论最后说，在这全世界的舆论要求和平的呼声比过去任何时候都更强烈的时候，联盟应当走在这一气氛的前面，而不是落在它的后面。
