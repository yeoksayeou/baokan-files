　　Suburban Beijing Farmers Support the Grain Unified Purchase and Marketing Policy

　　(Our dispatch) Farmers in the suburbs of Beijing warmly support the "Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Marketing of Grain in Rural Areas" promulgated by the State Council, and have expressed their determination to continue to work hard to increase grain production for the country.

　　Li Yuxia, a member of the Management Committee of the Yuanda Vegetable Production Cooperative in Haidian District, Beijing, said: "Our cooperative unanimously supports this policy. This provides a guarantee for our national construction and the improvement of our personal lives as farmers." Yuan Ming, deputy director of the Sijiqing Vegetable Production Cooperative, said: "If this new method is implemented, it is guaranteed that everyone's enthusiasm for labor will be further enhanced, so that those who lack grain can work hard to become self-sufficient; those with surplus grain will work even harder to make their lives more prosperous." Cheng Xuexin, director of the Xishan Agricultural Production Cooperative, said: "Our cooperative mainly grows vegetables. We lacked grain last year. This year we will work harder to strive for self-sufficiency." Guo Hongtai, deputy director of the Baipenyao Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengtai District, said: "The new method states that under normal conditions, the amount of grain purchased will remain unchanged for three years. The state takes such good care of us farmers, we must find every way to increase production, hand over good grain to the state, and support national industrial construction."

　　After the Huang'antu Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in the Jingxi Mining Area implemented the "Three Fixes" policy this spring, the enthusiasm of the cooperative members for production was high. The output was set at more than 197,000 jin of grain (the actual harvest in 1954 was more than 110,000 jin), and it is now estimated that it can produce 220,000 jin. After the "Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Marketing of Grain in Rural Areas" was promulgated, the cooperative's accountant, Ren Chengkong, said: "We are still opening up 200 mu of wasteland to increase grain production, reduce the state's supply to us, and allow the state to use more grain for construction." The Hongxing Collective Farm in Nanyuan District, with a population of more than 3,000, relied on government allocation of grain supply for a long time last year due to flooding. They deeply appreciate the benefits of unified grain purchase and marketing. Yu Chaokai, chairman of the farm, said: "Last year, other places provided us with 800,000 to 900,000 jin of grain. This year, the wheat we planted has already had a bumper harvest, and we are now striving for a bumper harvest of autumn crops. We will definitely sell more than 800,000 jin of surplus grain to the state in accordance with the measures promulgated by the State Council to support the cities and support the victorious completion of the first five-year plan."

　　京郊农民拥护粮食统购统销办法
    本报讯　北京市郊区农民热烈拥护国务院公布的“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”，纷纷表示要继续努力生产，为国家增产粮食。
    北京海淀区远大蔬菜生产合作社管理委员会委员李玉侠说：“我们社一致拥护这个政策。这对我们国家建设，对我们农民个人生活的提高，都有了保证。”四季青蔬菜生产合作社副主任袁明说：“这个新办法贯彻下去，保险大伙儿劳动积极性能更加提高，让缺粮的使劲生产，变成不缺；有余粮的更加一把劲，生活更富裕。”西山农业生产合作社主任程学信说：“我们社是以种蔬菜为主，去年缺粮，今年加一把劲，争取自给自足。”丰台区白盆窑乡农业生产合作社副主任郭洪泰说：“新办法上写着在正常年景下，收购粮食数三年不变。国家这么照顾我们农民，我们一定想一切办法增产，把好粮交给国家，支援国家工业建设。”
    京西矿区黄安坨农林牧生产合作社在今年春季贯彻“三定”政策后，社员生产情绪高涨，产量定为十九万七千多斤粮食（一九五四年实打十一万多斤），现在估计能产二十二万斤。“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”公布后，这个社的会计任成恭说：“我们现在还在开二百亩的荒地来增产粮食，减少国家对我们的供应，让国家把更多的粮食运用到建设上去。”南苑区红星集体农庄三千多人口，去年因为水涝，长期靠政府调拨粮食供应。他们深刻体会到粮食统购统销的好处。农庄主席于潮凯说：“去年别的地方接济了我们八、九十万斤粮食，今年我们种植的小麦已经丰收，现在正在争取大秋作物丰收，我们一定按国务院公布的办法，把八十多万斤余粮卖给国家，支持城市，支援第一个五年计划胜利完成。”
