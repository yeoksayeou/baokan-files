Patriotism and Law-Abidingness are the Conditions and Symbols for Capitalist Industrialists and Businessmen to Accept Socialist Transformation

    According to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, people's committees and financial departments at all levels, under the principle of overall planning and comprehensive consideration, are arranging and transforming capitalist industry and commerce industry by industry and trade by trade through various forms of state capitalism. Through these arrangement and transformation steps, state capitalism has been further developed; capitalists have also strengthened their economic ties with and dependence on the state. Many capitalists and capitalist agents have realized that the bright future of themselves and their children is inseparable from the strength of the country and the cause of socialist construction, thereby enhancing their patriotic enthusiasm and the initiative to accept socialist transformation. However, the thinking of some capitalists still lags behind the changes in their actual economic status. Instead of increasingly entrusting their fate to the strength of the country and the achievements of socialist construction as the socialist transformation deepens, they proceed from the old viewpoint of seeking profit and are dissatisfied with socialist transformation, adopting negative behaviors such as slowing down work, withdrawing funds, corrupting the working masses, and repeating the "five poisons," resisting socialist transformation to varying degrees. A small number of reactionary capitalists destroy machinery, set fire to factories, collude with hooligans and habitual thieves, and even collude with domestic counter-revolutionaries and foreign imperialists, embarking on the road of national betrayal. This shows that in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, it is necessary to constantly strengthen the patriotic and law-abiding education of capitalists and capitalist agents, fight against all their illegal activities, and resolutely suppress the small number of reactionary elements and counter-revolutionary elements, in order to gradually transform capitalist enterprises into socialist enterprises and transform most of the bourgeois elements into citizens of socialist society. At present, in the overall arrangement, some competent business authorities are busy with arrangements, neglecting the education and transformation of capitalists, and fighting against their illegal activities, which should be corrected.

    In our country's conditions, patriotism and law-abidingness are consistent with accepting socialist transformation. What we want to love is only the socialist country, so we must accept socialist transformation. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in the report on the draft constitution of our country: "In our country, there are actually only two roads for people to choose, either to be enslaved by imperialism again, or to realize socialism. If China wants independence, democracy, and prosperity, it can only take the socialist road. Under such circumstances, all patriotic people who are unwilling to be colonial slaves have the possibility of uniting under the leadership of the working class to accept the socialist road." Conversely, if they stubbornly adhere to the viewpoint of seeking profit and resolutely resist socialist transformation, they will inevitably embark on the road of national betrayal. "Because if they insist on making China take the capitalist road, they will inevitably have to contact the imperialist countries, but the imperialists will not allow China to become an independent capitalist country, but will only make China a colony ruled by imperialists and feudal comprador classes. This is exactly the road taken by Chiang Kai-shek, the traitor." (Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution of our country)

    Since we want to be patriotic, we must abide by the laws of the country. Because violating and destroying the country's constitution and laws will inevitably harm our national system and endanger socialist construction and the cause of socialist transformation. Our country's constitution stipulates: "The state adopts the policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation of capitalist industry and commerce." This policy has been gradually concretized in relevant laws, decrees, and regulations, so that all parties, public, private, labor, and capital, have specific codes of conduct in the various steps of socialist transformation. Capitalists and capitalist agents abide by the constitution and laws, decrees, and regulations, so that their actions can obtain correct guidelines and meet the requirements of socialist transformation. If they continue to do so consistently without giving up halfway, they can advance step by step along the road of socialist transformation under the guidance of the constitution and laws, decrees, and regulations, and obtain a bright future. The state's policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation, as well as the laws, decrees, and regulations that concretize this policy, all contain provisions to protect the legitimate interests of capitalists and capitalist agents. Therefore, capitalists and capitalist agents can only protect their legitimate interests by completely and comprehensively abiding by the law. Some capitalists adopt a very one-sided attitude towards the law. They only require the law to protect their legitimate interests, but evade or violate the law's restrictions on them. This is completely wrong. Those who adhere to this wrong attitude will not only find it difficult to obtain a bright future through transformation, but also damage their legitimate interests today. It is impossible to imagine that they can violate state laws on the one hand and have their legitimate interests protected by law on the other. A person who violates the law loses the protection of the law himself. Isn't this a very clear principle?

    Because the bourgeoisie's nature of seeking profit is fundamentally in conflict with national law, capitalists and capitalist agents need to undergo repeated education, constant struggle, and long-term transformation to be law-abiding. The national bourgeoisie received a very profound legal education in the great "Five-Anti" movement, and has since received such education many times, but their illegal activities are still frequently discovered in large numbers. Some capitalists corrupt and win over some backward workers, privately increase wages behind the backs of state labor administrative organs, and pass on the burden of wage increases to the state-owned economy through processing and ordering. Some capitalists do not actively improve business management, improve technology, and reduce defective products in processing and ordering, but instead win over a few backward employees to jointly deal with the state-owned economy, substituting inferior goods for good ones. These behaviors are obviously the most vicious provocative behaviors and the most egregious illegal behaviors that undermine socialist construction, which must be stopped and overcome through struggle. These facts also fully prove that it is a long and arduous process of education and struggle to make capitalists and their agents law-abiding. Representatives and key members of the industrial and commercial circles, the China Democratic National Construction Association, and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce should take the education of capitalists and capitalist agents to be patriotic and law-abiding, and to fight against their illegal activities, as their long-term and regular work. It is necessary to conduct regular and universal education on the domestic and international situation and the state's policies and laws. In particular, it is necessary to educate and guide them to actively accept the management of state administrative organs, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the working masses, and to disclose all business secrets, only in this way can we truly block the path to illegal activities. In some places, under the guidance of state administrative organs and with the assistance and cooperation of trade unions, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce regularly or frequently inspects the members' compliance with processing and ordering contracts and distribution and sales regulations. After discovering problems, they urge and help capitalists and their agents to make corrections through ideological education and business guidance; in some places, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce uses major illegal cases as examples to conduct vivid and practical patriotic and law-abiding education for members. These are all practical and feasible methods and should be promoted.

    Some people believe that advocating that capitalists and capitalist agents should be patriotic and law-abiding is an unreasonably low requirement. They say that for capitalists and capitalist agents, especially the key members among them, we should advocate studying Marxism-Leninism, changing class stand and class composition, rather than the issue of patriotism and law-abidingness. This is an impractical high note. They do not understand that patriotism and law-abidingness are of course a minimum condition, but for capitalists and capitalist agents, it is by no means something that can be easily achieved, and it is only through long-term education and struggle that they can reach this condition. The so-called changing class stand or class composition also confuses the boundaries of the state's current policy towards capitalist industry and commerce; what the state requires of capitalists today is to actively accept socialist transformation, and allows them to obtain legitimate profits, not to immediately give up exploitation. Therefore, this high note, in terms of its objective effect, can only make people relax their vigilance and struggle against the illegal activities of capitalists and capitalist agents, and is therefore a harmful high note. As for studying Marxism-Leninism, anyone, as long as they are not singing high notes in vain, but are sincerely willing to learn, is of course welcome and encouraged.

    Among some capitalists and capitalist agents, there is also a saying that "patriotism is easy, but law-abidingness is difficult." This is also completely wrong. This statement separates and opposes patriotism and law-abidingness. In fact, law-abidingness is a symbol of patriotism, and patriotism, law-abidingness, and acceptance of socialist transformation are completely consistent. If it is said that it is not easy for the bourgeoisie to consciously abide by the law, this is in line with the facts, because the bourgeoisie is a class that harms others to benefit themselves and seeks profit. However, if we truly recognize the difficulty of abiding by the law, capitalists should be vigilant against illegal activities and actively and seriously accept education and transformation. Those who shout "law-abidingness is difficult" do not mean this, but say that the laws of the country are difficult to abide by. Their basis is that the laws of the country are not complete, the interpretation of the laws is not entirely consistent, and some state workers have deviations in law enforcement. This view is of course wrong. Our country already has a constitution, and has gradually formulated some laws, decrees, and regulations in various aspects. In political life, economic life, and social life, there are codes of conduct to follow in fundamental and major aspects. As long as people abide by the constitution and existing laws, decrees, and regulations, they will not violate the law on fundamental and major issues. As for the fact that our country's laws are not yet complete, this is because in the transitional period, the situation is complex, things are changing rapidly, and our experience in many aspects is insufficient, and the laws can only be gradually formulated and completed with the development of work and the accumulation of experience. It is precisely because the laws are incomplete that the interpretation of the laws may not be entirely consistent. However, patriotic capitalists and capitalist agents should actively assist the state in consolidating the law, and should not take advantage of this situation to exploit loopholes, violate the law, or conceal their illegal activities. From the standpoint of safeguarding and consolidating the law, that is, from the standpoint of patriotism and law-abidingness, for those who have incomplete laws, they should take a positive attitude, put forward suggestions, and assist the state to gradually complete it; if the interpretation of the law is inconsistent, they should ask the leading organs to reinterpret it; if state workers have deviations in law enforcement, they can raise objections or protests; if state workers have illegal activities, they can report them. This is the only attitude that patriotic and law-abiding capitalists and capitalist agents should take. Taking this attitude, there is no so-called "difficulty in abiding by the law." Therefore, all patriotic and law-abiding capitalists and capitalist agents, especially their representatives, should fight against this erroneous statement.

    The state requires capitalists and capitalist agents to be patriotic and law-abiding, but also allows them to conduct legal struggles. If capitalists and capitalist agents openly and legally put forward their opinions and demands, the state will not only adopt their reasonable opinions and demands, but even if they put forward some wrong opinions, the state will patiently explain and criticize them in order to help them correct their mistakes and enhance unity, and will not attack them because they put forward wrong opinions. Their representatives must not only set an example, educate capitalists and capitalist agents to be patriotic and law-abiding, and fight against their illegal activities, but also actively represent their legitimate interests and reasonable demands. These two aspects must be combined without any bias, in order to meet the state's requirements for key members of the industrial and commercial circles. Some people one-sidedly emphasize representing legitimate interests, and only pay attention to and look for the shortcomings of state workers, attacking them, but do not pay attention to or are unwilling to fight against the illegal activities of capitalists; or they neither make suggestions nor reflect the situation on the legitimate interests and reasonable demands of the industrial and commercial circles, and do not help to get a proper solution. These are all wrong.

    State workers should always pay attention to educating capitalists and capitalist agents to be patriotic and law-abiding, and be vigilant, and at any time resolutely fight against all their illegal activities. They must not only focus on business, forget politics, only focus on the arrangement of capitalist industry and commerce, and ignore the education of capitalists and fight against their illegal activities. It must be recognized that this is an important part of the regular and fierce class struggle in the transitional period. Therefore, we must take a very serious attitude on this issue. At the same time, this is also a very complex issue, and law enforcement must be based on facts, distinguish right from wrong, and distinguish between the seriousness of the situation. State workers should especially make themselves a model of law-abiding and trustworthiness, and set an example in educating and guiding the masses to abide by the law. Only in this way can we consolidate the prestige of the law, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and smoothly carry out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

    爱国守法是资本主义工商业者接受社会主义改造的条件和标志
    根据中共中央和国务院的指示，各级人民委员会和财经部门在统筹兼顾的方针下，经过各种国家资本主义的形式，正对资本主义工商业逐行逐业地进行安排和改造，经过这些安排和改造的步骤，国家资本主义已有进一步的发展；资本家们也加强了对国家的经济联系和依赖。不少资本家和资本家代理人，已经认识到他们个人和他们的子女的光明前途是同国家的强大和社会主义建设事业不可分离的，从而提高了他们的爱国热情和接受社会主义改造的积极性。但是，还有一部分资本家的思想还落后于他们实际的经济地位的变化，他们不是随着社会主义改造的深入，而日益将他们的命运依托于国家的强大和社会主义建设的成就，而是从唯利是图的旧观点出发，对社会主义改造心怀不满，采取消极怠工、抽走资金、腐蚀工人群众、重施“五毒”等违法行为，在不同程度上对社会主义改造进行抵抗。少数反动资本家则破坏机器、纵火烧厂，与流氓惯窃结伙，甚至与国内反革命分子和外国帝国主义相勾结，走上卖国贼的道路。这说明，在对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造中，必须经常加强对资本家和资本家代理人的爱国守法教育，同他们的一切违法行为进行斗争，坚决镇压其中的少数反动分子和反革命分子，才有利于将资本主义企业逐步改造为社会主义企业，将资产阶级分子大部分改造为社会主义社会的公民。目前在全业安排中，有些主管业务机关忙于安排，忽视了对资本家进行教育、改造，并向他们的违法行为进行斗争，是应该注意纠正的。
    在我国的条件下，爱国守法和接受社会主义改造，是一致的东西。我们要爱的只是社会主义国家，因此就必须接受社会主义改造。正如刘少奇同志在关于我国宪法草案的报告中指出的：“在我国给人们选择的道路，实际上只有两条，或者是重新受帝国主义的奴役，或者是实现社会主义。中国要独立、民主和富强，只有走社会主义一条路。在这种情况下，凡是不愿意做殖民地奴隶的爱国的人们，就有在工人阶级领导下团结起来接受社会主义道路的可能。”与此相反，如果顽固地坚持唯利是图的观点、坚决反抗社会主义改造，就必然要走上卖国的道路。“因为他们既然坚持要使中国走资本主义的道路，就势必要同帝国主义国家联系起来，而帝国主义者却不会让中国成为独立的资本主义的国家，只会使中国成为帝国主义和封建买办阶级统治的殖民地。这正是蒋介石卖国贼所走的道路。”（刘少奇同志关于我国宪法草案的报告）
    既然要爱国，也就必须遵守国家的法律。因为违反和破坏国家的宪法和法律，就必然要损害我们的国家制度，危害社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业。我国的宪法规定：“国家对资本主义工商业采取利用、限制和改造的政策。”这个政策又在有关的法律、法令和规章中逐步获得具体化，使公、私、劳、资各方在社会主义改造的各个步骤上有了具体的行为规范。资本家和资本家代理人遵守宪法和法律、法令、规章，就能使自己的行动获得正确的准绳，符合社会主义改造的要求。这样一贯地做下去，并不半途而废，他们就能在宪法和法律、法令、规章的指引下，一步一步地循着社会主义改造的道路前进，获得光明的前途。国家的利用、限制和改造的政策，以及把这个政策具体化的法律、法令和规章，都包含有保护资本家和资本家代理人的合法利益的规定。因此，资本家和资本家代理人也只有完整地和全面地遵守法律，才有利于保护他们的合法利益。有些资本家对待法律采取非常片面的态度，他们只要求法律保护他们的合法利益，却逃避或者破坏法律对于他们的限制。这是完全错误的。坚持这种错误态度的人，不但难以经过改造而获得光明的前途，而且也破坏了他们在今天的合法利益。不可能设想，他们一方面破坏国家法律，另一方面又能使他们的合法利益获得法律的保护。破坏了法律的人，他自己也就失去了法律的保障。这难道不是很明白的道理吗？
    由于资产阶级唯利是图的本质是根本上同国家法律抵触的，资本家和资本家代理人要做到守法，需要经过反复的教育，经常的斗争和长期的改造。民族资产阶级在伟大的“五反”运动中受到一次极深刻的守法教育，以后又多次受到这种教育，但他们的违法行为还时常大量发现。有些资本家腐蚀和拉拢某些落后工人，背着国家劳动行政机关私自提高工资，又通过加工订货把提高工资的负担转嫁给国营经济。有些资本家在加工订货中不是积极改善经营管理、改进技术、减少次品，而是拉拢少数落后的职工共同对付国营经济，以次货顶好货。这种种行为，显然是最毒辣的挑拨行为和最恶劣的破坏社会主义建设的违法行为，必须经过斗争加以制止和克服。这些事实也充分证明，要使资本家及其代理人做到守法，是一个长期的艰苦的教育和斗争的过程。工商业界的代表人物和骨干分子，民主建国会和工商业联合会都应当把教育资本家和资本家代理人爱国守法，并向他们的违法行为进行斗争，作为自己长期的经常的工作。要对他们经常地和普遍地进行国内外形势和国家的政策法令的教育。特别要教育和引导他们积极地接受国家行政机关的管理、国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督、公开一切营业秘密，只有这样，才能真正堵塞违法活动的门路。有些地方，工商业联合会在国家行政机关指导下，在工会的协助和配合下，定期地或经常地检查会员遵守加工订货合同和经销代销规章的情况，发现问题后，通过思想教育和业务指导，督促和帮助资本家及其代理人进行改正；还有些地方的工商业联合会用重大的违法案件作实例，对会员进行生动、实际的爱国守法教育。这些都是实际可行的办法，应当加以推广。
    有些人认为提倡资本家和资本家代理人要爱国守法，未免要求太低了。他们说，对于资本家和资本家代理人，特别是其中的骨干分子，应当提倡学习马克思列宁主义，改变阶级立场和阶级成分，而不是什么爱国守法的问题。这是一种不切合实际的高调。他们不了解，爱国守法当然是一个起码的条件，但对于资本家和资本家代理人来说，决不是轻易可以做到的事情，只有经过长期的教育和斗争才能使他们达到这个条件。所谓改变阶级立场或阶级成分，也是混淆国家对资本主义工商业当前的政策界限的；国家今天要求资本家的是积极接受社会主义改造，并允许他们取得合法利润，还不是要他们立即放弃剥削。所以，这种高调就其客观效果而论是只能使人们放松对资本家和资本家代理人的违法行为的警惕和斗争，因而是一种有害的高调。至于学习马克思列宁主义，不论任何人，只要不是空唱高调，而是真心愿意学习，当然是值得欢迎和鼓励的。
    在一部分资本家和资本家代理人中间还流行着一种“爱国容易，守法难”的说法。这也是完全错误的。这种说法把爱国和守法割裂开来和对立起来。实际上守法是爱国的标志，爱国、守法和接受社会主义改造是完全一致的东西。如果说资产阶级要做到自觉地守法是不容易的事，这是合乎事实的，因为资产阶级是损人利己唯利是图的阶级。但是，如果真正认识到守法的不容易，资本家们就应当警惕违法，并积极地严肃地接受教育和改造。那些叫喊“守法难”的人，并不是这个意思，而是说国家的法律难守。他们的根据是：国家的法律不完备，法律的解释不尽一致，某些国家工作人员执法有偏差。这种看法当然是错误的。我们的国家已经有了宪法，又已经在各方面逐步制定了一些法律、法令和规章，在政治生活、经济生活和社会生活上，在根本的和主要的方面都已经有行为的规范可循。只要人们遵守宪法和已有的法律、法令和规章，在根本的和主要的问题上就不会违法。至于说我们国家的法律还不完备，这是因为在过渡时期中，情况是复杂的，事物的变化是迅速的，我们在许多方面的经验都是不够的，法律只能随着工作的发展和经验的积累而逐步加以制定和完备。正因为法律不完备，法律的解释也可能有不尽一致的地方。但爱国的资本家和资本家代理人，应当积极地协助国家巩固法律，而不应当利用这种情况钻空子，破坏法律，或者掩饰他们的违法行为。从维护和巩固法律的立场出发，即从爱国守法的立场出发，对于法律不完备者，应当采取积极态度，提出建议，协助国家使它逐步完备；法律解释不一，应当提请领导机关重新解释；国家工作人员执法有偏差，可以提出异议或抗议；国家工作人员有违法行为，可以进行检举。这是爱国守法的资本家和资本家代理人所应当采取的唯一态度。采取这种态度，就没有所谓“守法难”的问题了。因此，一切爱国守法的资本家和资本家代理人，特别是他们的代表人物，都应当同这种错误的说法作斗争。
    国家要求资本家和资本家代理人爱国守法，但也容许他们进行合法斗争。资本家、资本家代理人，如果是公开合法地提出他们的意见和要求，国家不但将采纳他们的合理的意见和要求，即使他们提了些错误的意见，国家也会耐心地给以解释和批判，以便帮助他们改正错误，增进团结，而不会因为他们提了错误的意见对他们加以打击。他们中的代表人物，既要以身作则，教育资本家和资本家代理人爱国守法，向他们的违法行为作斗争，又要积极地代表他们的合法利益和合理要求。必须把这两个方面结合起来，无所偏废，才符合国家对于工商界骨干分子的要求。有些人片面地强调代表合法利益，专门注意和寻找国家工作人员的缺点，进行攻击，而不注意或不愿意向资本家的违法行为进行斗争；或者对工商界的合法利益和合理要求，既不提建议也不反映情况，不帮助得到正当的解决。这些都是错误的。
    国家工作人员要经常注意对资本家和资本家代理人进行爱国守法的教育，并提高警惕，随时同他们的一切违法行为进行坚决的斗争，不可只顾业务，忘了政治，只顾对资本主义工商业的安排，忽视对资本家进行教育，并向他们的违法行为进行斗争。必须认识，这是过渡时期中经常的激烈的阶级斗争的一个重要内容。所以在这个问题上，必须采取十分严肃的态度。同时，这又是一个十分复杂的问题，执法必须实事求是，分清是非，分别轻重。国家工作人员尤其应当使自己成为守法、守信用的模范，以身作则教育和引导人民群众守法。只有这样，才能巩固法律的威信，巩固人民民主专政，顺利地进行对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。
