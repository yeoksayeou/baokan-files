The 1955 National Swimming Competition opened in Shanghai on the 20th. On this day, two national records were broken in the men's and women's five preliminary events.

A total of 293 male and female athletes from 17 provinces and cities across the country participated in this competition. Among them were many ethnic minorities, returned overseas Chinese, and 30 young athletes under the age of sixteen.

The competition was held at the Jiangwan Swimming Pool, located twenty miles away from the Shanghai city center. More than 5,000 spectators braved the intense heat to watch the competition. They had pre-purchased tickets for today as early as three days ago.

At 3:00 PM, two young athletes, holding the national flag high, led all the athletes in a march-in ceremony. Song Richang, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, Cai Shufan, Deputy Director of the Sports Commission, and others delivered speeches at the meeting. Then, the intense competition began.

Huang Lianhua of the Shanghai team achieved a time of 1 minute 12.3 seconds in the women's 100-meter freestyle preliminary round, which was 2.1 seconds faster than the national record. Qi Lieyun of the Guangdong team also broke the national record of 1 minute 14.9 seconds with a time of 1 minute 14.4 seconds in the men's 100-meter breaststroke preliminary round. In the men's 800-meter freestyle relay final, the four athletes of the Guangdong team won first place with a time of 9 minutes 53.8 seconds, receiving the gold medal of the competition. The Tianjin team, which came in second, received the silver medal. Teams from Sichuan, Shanghai, Guangxi, and Fujian also received awards.

The last event of today's competition was the water polo match between the Shanghai team and the Liaoning team. A national water polo competition was held for the first time in our country. The team members competed fiercely in the water, and the Shanghai team won with a score of 6 to 1.

Before the opening, the competition had already held three water polo matches and a diving performance. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　全国游泳竞赛大会在上海开幕
    一九五五年全国游泳竞赛大会二十日在上海开幕。这天，在男、女五项预赛中，有两项成绩打破了全国最高纪录。
    参加这次大会的有全国十七个省、市的男、女运动员共二百九十三人。其中有不少少数民族和归国华侨，还有三十名十六岁以下的少年运动员。
    竞赛在远离上海市中心区二十里以外的江湾游泳池举行。五千多观众冒着酷热前去观看比赛。他们早在三天前就预购了今天的门票。
    下午三点，由两个青年运动员高举国旗引导全体运动员举行了入场式。上海市副市长宋日昌、体育运动委员会副主任蔡树藩等先后在会上讲了话。接着就开始了紧张的竞赛。
    上海队的黄莲华在女子一百公尺自由泳预赛中，成绩达到了一分十二秒三，比全国最高纪录快了二秒一。广东队的戚烈云在男子一百公尺蛙泳预赛中，也以一分十四秒四的成绩打破了一分十四秒九的全国最高纪录。在男子八百公尺自由泳接力决赛中，广东队四个运动员以九分五十三秒八的成绩获得第一名，得到了大会的金质奖章。第二名的天津队得到了银质奖章。四川、上海、广西、福建四个队也分别得到奖励。
    今天竞赛的最后一项是上海队对辽宁队的水球比赛。全国性水球比赛在我国还是第一次举行。两队队员在水中紧张竞争，结果上海队以六比一获胜。
    在开幕前，大会已举行了三场水球比赛和一次跳水表演。　（新华社）
