City Residents Must Save Food
State Employees and Workers Should Exemplarily Abide by the Grain Supply System
Chen Zhao
Currently, cities are taking measures to verify and supply grain, and rectify the work of unified grain purchase and sales. Ensuring the successful completion of this work is of great significance for consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, promoting national construction, and improving people's lives. Every grain consumer has a responsibility to obey the grain supply plan and assist the government in rectifying the work of unified grain purchase and sales. As advanced members of the urban population, members of institutions, organizations, and enterprises should play an exemplary and leading role in this regard.

Obeying the national grain supply plan and saving grain is an important matter of changing customs and habits. Because, consciously obeying the national supply plan in grain consumption and saving grain consumption as much as possible is the new morality and new atmosphere that needs to be widely promoted among the masses today. The establishment and promotion of this new morality and atmosphere must first have the active advocacy and support of state employees and workers. This is an obvious truth. This is one aspect. On the other hand, it should also be seen that members of various institutions, organizations, enterprises, and their families account for a considerable proportion of the entire urban population. In the current verified grain supply, whether the grain consumption of this part of the population can be verified will directly affect the implementation of the entire city's grain supply plan. From this, it can be seen how important it is for state employees and workers to exemplarily abide by the national grain supply system.

Most of our state employees and workers understand this principle and act accordingly in practice. Their exemplary behavior has won the praise of the broad masses. However, there are still many state employees and workers who treat the work of grain verification and supply with an incorrect attitude. For example, some employees hold the idea of ​​"being generous for preparedness" when ordering grain plans, trying to buy more grain from the state. Li Muci, a staff member of the Second District Health Center in Nanjing, felt that the 200 jin grain plan ordered by his family was too little, and asked the government to increase the supply by 10 jin. But in fact, his family had been hoarding more than 90 jin of rice for a long time without using it, and some of the rice had become moldy and discolored due to being stored for too long. Some staff members and workers take an indifferent attitude towards the verified planned supply, and find it troublesome to order grain plans. They are neither willing to seriously calculate their own grain consumption, nor do they care about their family's ordered grain plan. This kind of wrong thinking and practice is one of the main reasons why the grain consumption plans of many institutions, organizations, enterprises, schools, and families are too high.

We must never regard ordering grain plans and saving grain as trivial matters; whether the supply and consumption of grain are reasonable is a major matter related to the country's industrialization and the lives of people nationwide. Before the realization of agricultural collectivization and mechanization in our country, there is a certain limit to the increase in grain production. However, due to the development of national industrialization and the improvement of the living standards of urban and rural people, the increase in grain demand is very rapid. Therefore, ensuring the rational supply and rational consumption of grain has become a major event in national construction and people's lives in the current period. Since state employees and workers can create wealth for the country, accumulate funds, and support national industrial construction little by little in various production and work positions, then what reason can they have for not attaching importance to saving grain for the country in daily life? It must be understood that saving a little grain from the consumption side means that the country increases a little grain reserve, which means adding a strength to the country's industrial construction and national defense construction. There are tens of millions of members of various institutions, organizations, and enterprises in the country. If everyone can attach importance to saving grain, consciously obey the national grain supply system, and use their exemplary actions to lead urban residents across the country to do a good job in verifying the planned supply by household, then good results will definitely be achieved.

State employees and workers exemplarily abide by the national grain planned supply system, mainly it should be reflected in their ability to be careful in planning and order their own and their family's grain consumption plan in accordance with the requirements of the state. If someone believes that he has fully realized the importance of abiding by and implementing the national grain planned supply system and saving grain, but he is unwilling to order his own and his family's grain consumption plan in accordance with the requirements of the state, and is unwilling to carefully calculate his grain consumption, then this person is not using practical actions to prove that he obeys the national grain planned supply system and is willing to save grain, but only shows that he is a complete armchair strategist.

    城市居民家家户户都要节约粮食
    国家工作人员和工人应模范地遵守粮食供应制度
    陈昭
    目前各城市正在采取粮食核实供应的措施，整顿粮食统销工作。保证这个工作的胜利完成，对于巩固工农联盟、推进国家建设和改善人民生活，都有重要的意义。每个粮食消费者都有责任服从粮食供应计划、协助政府把粮食统销工作整顿好，而作为城市人民中的先进部分的机关、团体、企业等单位的成员，更应当在这方面起模范和带头作用。
    服从国家粮食供应计划和节约粮食，是一桩移风易俗的重要事情。因为，在粮食消费上自觉地服从国家供应计划，尽可能地节约粮食的消费，这就是今天要在全体人民群众中广为发扬的新道德、新风气，而这种新的道德、风气的树立和发扬，首先必须有国家工作人员和工人的积极倡导和支持。这是显而易见的道理。这是一方面。另一方面还应当看到，各机关、团体、企业等单位的成员连同他们的家属在一起，在整个城市人口中占有相当大的比重。在目前粮食核实供应中，这部分人口的粮食消费量能否核实，会直接影响整个城市粮食供应计划的执行。由此可见，国家工作人员和工人模范地遵守国家粮食供应制度有多么重要的意义。
    我们的大多数国家工作人员和工人是了解这个道理的，在实际行动上也是这样做的。他们的模范行为博得了广大群众的赞扬。但是，在国家工作人员和工人中也还有不少的人用不正确的态度来对待粮食核实供应工作。例如有些工作人员在订用粮计划时抱着“宽打备用”的想法，企图多向国家购买粮食。南京市第二区卫生所工作人员李慕慈，看到自己家庭订的二百斤用粮计划还嫌少，又向政府要求增加了十斤供应量，但实际上他家里长时期藏着九十多斤大米不用，有些大米已因藏得久了而发霉变色。还有些工作人员和工人对核实计划供应采取漠不关心的态度，对订用粮计划嫌麻烦，他们既不愿意认真地核算自己的用粮数量，也不过问自己家庭订用粮计划的事。这种错误思想和作法正是许多机关、团体、企业、学校和家庭的用粮计划偏高的主要原因之一。
    我们绝不应当把订用粮计划和节约粮食看做是小事；粮食的供应和消费是否合理，是关系国家工业化和全国人民生活的大事。在我国农业实现合作化和机械化以前，粮食增产是有一定限度的。但是由于国家工业化的发展和城乡人民生活水平的提高，粮食需要量的增长却是很迅速的。因此，保证粮食的合理供应和合理消费就成为当前时期国家建设和人民生活中的一件大事。国家工作人员和工人既然能在各个生产和工作岗位上一点一滴地为国家创造财富，积累资金，支援国家工业建设，那末，有什么理由可以不重视在日常生活方面为国家节约粮食呢？必须了解，从消费方面节省下一点粮食，就意味着国家增加一点粮食储备，就意味着给国家工业建设和国防建设增加一分力量。全国各机关、团体、企业等单位的成员有几千万人，如果每个人都能重视节约粮食，自觉地服从国家的粮食供应制度，以自己的模范行动来带动全国城市居民作好按户核实计划供应工作，那末，一定会取得很好的成绩。
    国家工作人员和工人模范地遵守国家粮食计划供应制度，主要地应该表现在他们能够精打细算，按照国家的要求订好自己和家庭的用粮计划。如果有人认为他对遵守执行国家粮食计划供应制度和节约粮食的重要意义都已经完全认识，但是他就是不愿意按照国家的要求来订好自己和家庭的用粮计划，不愿意精打细算一斤一两地来计算自己的用粮，那末，这个人就不是用实际行动来证明他服从国家粮食计划供应制度和愿意节约粮食，而只是表明他是一个十足的空谈家。
