    The Fertile Tarim Basin
    Han Jiang
    South of the Tianshan Mountains and north of the Kunlun Mountains in Xinjiang Province, surrounded by the famous Great Gobi Desert, lie countless fertile oases, which constitute the prosperous Tarim Basin.

    The Tarim Basin is the gathering place of the hardworking and brave Uyghur people. For thousands of years, they, along with farmers and herdsmen from other brotherly ethnic groups such as the Kyrgyz and Tajiks, have lived on this land. They have used their hands to overcome natural disasters such as drought and sandstorms, as well as various difficulties, opening up farmland, pastures, and orchards, developing the area into Xinjiang's main agricultural region with a population of over three million.

    Surrounding the Tarim Great Gobi Desert, the climate is mild, with long sunshine hours and a long frost-free period, with eight months of the year suitable for crop growth. The wheat, cotton, and corn produced here are of major importance in Xinjiang, and oil crops are also widely planted, with rice also grown in many areas. Rainfall is scarce in this area, and crops have always relied on snowmelt for irrigation. In recent years, due to the renovation of canals and the improvement of irrigation management, water sources in this area have been preliminarily and effectively utilized. The first phase of the "August 1st" Victory Canal project, completed in 1954 alone, added more than 210,000 mu of fertile land to the banks of the Aksu River. The area surrounding the entire Great Gobi Desert has expanded from over 9 million mu of cultivated land in the past to nearly 13 million mu. In 1949, there were very few places where the yield of wheat exceeded 150 jin per mu, but now many lands are harvesting more than 300 jin per mu. In 1954, the total harvest in the Tarim Basin increased by 50 percent compared to 1950.

    The Tarim Basin is not only Xinjiang's granary but also a future base for textile raw materials for the motherland. It has a large amount of sandy loam soil suitable for cotton planting, and many oases here have a frost-free period of 200 days. Not only is there great potential for expanding cotton fields and increasing cotton production, but the cotton fiber here is also long and has a good luster, making it a popular raw material for fine yarn in various places. There are also extremely abundant raw materials needed for high-grade textiles - wild hemp, and planned harvesting and cultivation experiments have now begun.

    The Tarim Basin is not only rich in agricultural products, but also has fruits available all year round, with peaches, apricots, grapes, etc., found everywhere. Large quantities of dried fruits are processed and sold to various places every year.

    The Tarim Basin also has abundant forests. In the Tianshan mountain valley, which extends for more than 340 kilometers from Luntai in the east to Wensu in the west, spruce forests and poplar and birch forests stretch endlessly; the dense wild paulownia trees along the Tarim River and the primeval forests in the Kunlun Mountains are all waiting for us to harvest.

    It also contains abundant reserves of petroleum, copper, lead, zinc, iron, and other rare metals. Places that were uninhabited in the past now have tents set up by exploration personnel. The barren Gobi Desert has now become a new mining area. These abundant resources will gradually be used in the motherland's socialist construction.

    富饶的塔里木盆地
    寒江
    新疆省天山以南，昆仑山以北，环绕在著名的大戈壁的周围，有无数肥美的绿洲，那就是富庶的塔里木盆地。
    塔里木盆地是勤劳勇敢的维吾尔族人民的聚居地区。千百年来，他们和柯尔克孜、塔吉克等其他兄弟民族的农牧民，一直生活在这块土地上。用他们的双手战胜了干旱、风沙等自然灾害和各种困难，开辟了农田、牧场和果园，使这里发展成了一个拥有三百多万人口的新疆主要农业区。
    塔里木大戈壁的周围，气候温和，日照和无霜期较长，全年有八个月适宜于农作物的生长。这里的小麦、棉花、玉米，都在新疆占主要地位，油料作物也普遍种植，而且很多地方还产稻子。这一带雨量稀少，农作物向来依靠雪水灌溉。几年来，由于渠道的整修，灌溉管理的改进，这一带的水源已初步有效地被利用起来。仅一九五四年完工的“八一”胜利渠第一期工程，就给阿克苏河岸增加了二十一万多亩良田。整个大戈壁周围，已由过去九百余万亩耕地，扩大到近一千三百万亩。一九四九年时，这里每亩小麦产量超过一百五十斤的还很少，现在很多土地上每亩已收获到了三百多斤。一九五四年塔里木盆地上的总收获量，比一九五○年增加了百分之五十。
    塔里木盆地不但是新疆的粮仓，而且是未来祖国纺织原料的基地。这里有着大量适宜植棉的砂质壤土，这里很多绿洲的无霜期都有二百天，不但扩大棉田和提高棉产量的潜力很大，而且这里的棉花纤维长，光泽好，是各地最受欢迎的细纱原料。这里还有极其丰富的供高级纺织品需用的原料——野麻，如今已开始有计划地进行采剥和栽培试验。
    塔里木盆地不但农产品富足，而且一年四季可吃到瓜果，桃、杏、葡萄等遍地皆是。每年都有大批晒制成的干果运销各地。
    塔里木盆地还有着丰富的森林。在东起轮台，西止温宿的长达三百四十多公里的天山山谷中，云杉林和杨、桦林绵延不绝；塔里木河两岸密集的野梧桐，昆仑山中的原始森林，都等待着我们去采伐。
    这里还蕴藏着丰富的石油、铜、铅、锌、铁及其他稀有金属。过去没有人烟的地方，现在已搭起探勘人员的帐篷。过去荒凉的戈壁，现在已成了新的矿区。这里丰富的资源，都将逐渐地用在祖国的社会主义建设事业上。
