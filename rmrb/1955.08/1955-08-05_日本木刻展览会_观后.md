Thoughts After Seeing the "Japanese Woodcut Exhibition"
	Gu Yuan

The "Japanese Woodcut Exhibition," currently held at the Beijing Art Exhibition Hall, showcases over two hundred Japanese woodcut works. These works were recently sent to the Chinese Artists Association and Chinese woodcut artists by the Japan Print Movement Association and woodcut artists from various parts of Japan.

Every time I see the works sent to China by Japanese woodcut artists, I feel happy and excited. I seem to see the Japanese woodcut artists striving to create in difficult circumstances, the battle-filled works being warmly welcomed by the Japanese people, and the Japanese people living a hard life under the military occupation of American imperialism. My heart is filled with concern and sympathy.

This exhibition has many excellent works, such as Niiju Hiroharu's "Stray Bullet" and "The Disaster of American Hydrogen Bomb Tests," Ueno Makoto's "Complaint of Atomic Disease Sufferers," "The Disabled," and "Sending Fishing Boats to Sea." These works not only profoundly depict the tragic lives of the Japanese people under American occupation but also express the Japanese people's resolute struggle to win national independence, oppose aggressive war, and oppose the use of atomic weapons. Suzuki Kenji's "At the US Military Base" shows us that the Japanese people have already taken active actions; they have rushed into the "bases" built by the United States on Japanese territory like a tide of anger, angrily tearing down the wire mesh posts and the insulting signs that read "No Japanese Allowed." We see the strong and noble patriotism of the Japanese people, which cannot help but arouse our respect, and we wish them victory. Oguchi Ichiro's "Talking About New China" depicts the Japanese people's joy, encouragement, and longing when discussing the achievements of New China, expressing the Japanese people's concern for New China and the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people. "Don't Forget Hanamoka" is a set of sequential woodcuts co-created by Niiju Hiroharu and Takidaira Jiro, with fifty-six pictures that movingly depict the tragic story of a group of Chinese prisoners of war who were abused and murdered in the Hanamoka mine in Akita Prefecture, Japan, during the War of Resistance Against Japan. It also depicts the fighting friendship of the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean people united against Japanese militarism. The content and structure of this set of sequential woodcuts are very good, and the knife technique is concise and expressive, making it an excellent work.

I love Maekawa Senpan's works such as "Firewood," "Street," and "Landscape," as well as Nakayama Tadashi's "Rural Snow Scene," Onchi Koshiro's "Bridge," Morikawashun's "Mantis," Sekino Junichiro's "Bridge," and other works. These color woodcuts are all rich in the style of Japanese national art and are very lovely. I also like some beautiful New Year cards and bookplates.

The exhibition also features some Japanese craft woodblock prints, with high achievements in engraving and printing, richly expressing Japanese national characteristics and embodying the artistic genius and wisdom of the Japanese working people. These works are similar to the watermark woodblock prints of Beijing's Rongbaozhai, and it can be seen that there is a deep and long-standing relationship between Japanese and Chinese art. Unfortunately, under the current American military occupation, Japanese national culture is being severely damaged and destroyed, and Japanese craft woodblock prints are also gradually declining, which is very regrettable.

Through this woodcut exhibition, we can learn more about the lives and struggles of the Japanese people and deepen the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people. At the same time, it makes us further realize that the Japanese woodcut movement is advancing in great strides along the right direction, and Japanese woodcut artists are striving to make their creations serve the just struggle of defending peace and striving for national independence. Let our Chinese and Japanese woodcut workers become closer and move forward hand in hand!

    “日本木刻展览会”观后
    古元
    正在北京美术展览馆举行的“日本木刻展览会”，展出了二百多幅日本木刻作品。这些作品，都是最近由日本版画运动协会和日本各地的木刻家陆续寄赠给中国美术家协会和中国木刻家们的。
    当我每次看见日本木刻家寄到中国来的作品时，总是感到高兴和激动：我仿佛看见日本木刻家在困难的处境中努力创作的情景，仿佛看见那些富有战斗性的作品受到日本人民群众热烈欢迎的情景，也仿佛看见日本人民在美帝国主义的军事占领下艰苦生活的情景，心里充满了关切和同情。
    这次展览会上有许多很好的作品，如新居广治的“流弹”和“美国试验氢弹的灾害”，上野诚的“原子病害者的控诉”、“病残者”和“送渔船出海”。这些作品不仅深刻地表现出美国占领下的日本人民悲惨的生活，而且表达出日本人民为争取民族独立、反对侵略战争、反对使用原子武器的坚决斗争。铃木贤二的“在美军基地”，使我们看到了日本人民已经积极行动起来，他们怒潮一样奋勇地冲进美国建立在日本国土上的“基地”，愤怒地拆毁那些铁丝网柱子和写着“不许日本人入内”的侮辱性标牌，我们看到了日本人民坚强的高尚的爱国主义精神，使我们不禁引起敬意，并祝盼他们获得胜利。小口一郎的“谈新中国”，描写日本人民谈论新中国的成就时那种欢欣鼓舞和向往的心情，表现了日本人民对于新中国的关切和中日两国人民的友谊。“不要忘记花冈”是新居广治和泷平二郎合作的一套连环木刻，五十六幅画面，十分感人地描写了抗日战争期间被虐杀在日本秋田县花冈矿山的一群中国战俘的惨痛故事，并描写了中、日、朝三国人民团结反抗日本军国主义的战斗的友谊，这套连环木刻的内容和结构都很好，刀法简练而富有表现力，是一个优秀的作品。
    我很喜爱前川千帆的“柴”、“街”、“风景”等作品，也喜爱中山正的“农村雪景”、恩地孝四郎的“桥”、守洞春的“螳螂”、关野准一郎的“桥”等等作品，这些套色木刻都富有日本民族艺术的风格，非常可爱。还有一些优美的贺年片和藏书票，我也很喜欢。
    展览会上还有一些日本的工艺木版画，刻工和印刷都有高度的成就，浓厚地表现了日本的民族特色，并体现着日本劳动人民的艺术天才和智慧。这些作品，类似北京荣宝斋的水印木版画，可以看出日本艺术同中国艺术之间有着深长的渊源关系。不幸的是：目前在美国的军事占领下，日本民族文化横遭破坏和摧残，日本的工艺木版画也在逐渐地衰退和凋落，这是使我们感到非常惋惜的。
    通过这次木刻展览会，我们能更多地了解日本人民的生活和斗争，并加深了中、日两国人民之间的友谊；同时，使我们进一步认识，日本的木刻运动正沿着正确的方向大步前进着，日本的木刻家正在努力使自己的创作服务于保卫和平、争取民族独立的正义斗争。让我们中、日两国的木刻工作者更加亲近起来，更加紧密地携手前进吧！
