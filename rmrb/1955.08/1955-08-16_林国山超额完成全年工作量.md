Lin Guoshan Exceeds Annual Work Quota
    Lin Guoshan, a young lathe operator in the metalworking shop of the Shenyang Transformer Factory, had already exceeded his 1955 work quota by the end of July.

    Influenced by the model actions of labor models Wang Chonglun and Wang Hengcheng, and with the constant help of Wang Chunjiu, a Communist Party member in the workshop, Lin Guoshan cultivated a correct attitude towards labor. Starting this year, he formulated a personal production plan. He arrives at the workshop ten to fifteen minutes before work every day to inspect tools and machines in advance, and organizes the tools, fixtures, and materials needed for the day, allowing him to concentrate on his work. He also actively participated in amateur technical studies and skillfully mastered four advanced Soviet cutting techniques. When making transformer rollers, his daily quota was six, but he could make twenty-three. He also greatly exceeded the work quota when processing the explosion-proof transformer box rims. In the first half of the year, there were a total of one hundred and twenty-nine working days, but the work he did was equivalent to two hundred and eighty-seven and a half days of work quota, and the quality also met the specified standards.

    林国山超额完成全年工作量
    沈阳变压器厂金工车间青年车工林国山，到七月底已经超额完成一九五五年工作量。
    林国山在劳动模范王崇伦和王恒成等的模范行动的影响下，并在车间共产党员王纯久的经常帮助下，培养了正确的劳动态度。从今年起，他订出了个人生产计划，每天在上班前十分钟到十五分钟就来到车间，事先检查工具和机器，把当天所用的刀具、卡具和材料都整理好，干起活来精神很集中。他并积极参加了业余技术学习，熟练地掌握了四种苏联先进的切削技术，在做变压器的滚轮时，每日定额六个，他能做二十三个。在加工防爆变压器的箱沿时，他也大大超过了工作定额。今年上半年共有一百二十九个工作日，但他做的活等于二百八十七天半的工作定额，质量也达到了规定的指标。
