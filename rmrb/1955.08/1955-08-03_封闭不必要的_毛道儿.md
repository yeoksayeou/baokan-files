    Close Unnecessary "Shortcuts"
    Editor:
    I saw a "shortcut" (a small path cutting through farmland) between Li Jing Village and Meng Jing Village in Hulan County, Heilongjiang Province, which was at least six feet wide, wide enough for a large cart to pass through. It is said that this was created by elementary school students walking to and from school. Later, I discovered that many villages in this county have "shortcuts" that are this wide. I feel this is a problem worth noting. According to calculations, the five "shortcuts" from Li Jing Village to the surrounding five satellite villages occupy more than thirty-five mu of land. If the land occupied by the "shortcuts" in all the villages in the county is calculated, the number will be very large.
    In fact, many "shortcuts" are often not far from the main roads and are completely unnecessary. Some "shortcuts" are needed, but they don't need to be that wide. The small paths that farmers use to go to the fields are at most only a foot wide. In order to avoid wasting land and increase crop yields, I suggest closing these unnecessary "shortcuts."

### 封闭不必要的“毛道儿”

    封闭不必要的“毛道儿”编辑同志：
    我在黑龙江省呼兰县厉井村和孟井村之间看到一条“毛道儿”（从庄稼地里插过去的小道），至少有六尺宽，满可以走开大车。据说，这是高小学生上学下学时踩出来的。后来，我又发现这个县的不少村子都有这末宽的“毛道儿”。我感到这是一个值得注意的问题。据计算，光厉井村通往周围五个卫星村的五条“毛道儿”，占地就在三十五亩以上；如果把全县各村“毛道儿”所占土地统计起来，数字将是很巨大的。
    实际上，很多“毛道儿”经常和大道距离不远，根本是不必要的。有些“毛道儿”虽然是需要的，但也用不着那末宽；像老乡们下地走的小道，最多也只有一尺宽。为了避免土地的浪费，增加农作物的产量，我建议封闭这些不必要的“毛道儿”。　方青
