How Lin Ruqi Helped His Family Formulate a Grain Rationing Plan
　　Wang Yiping

Lin Ruqi is the Party Branch Secretary of the Xisi District Trade Union in Beijing. At the end of May this year, when Beijing was rectifying the grain unified purchase and sales work and was about to implement household-based quantitative verification and supply, he thought: This is the Party's policy. I am a staff member and a Party member, so I must take the lead in implementing it and first formulate a grain consumption plan for my own family. In addition to him, his family includes his wife, a five-year-old child, and his wife's younger sister. He lives in the office and only goes home on Sundays. He usually doesn't ask about the oil, salt, firewood, and rice at home. After receiving his salary, he deducts his own food and pocket money and gives the rest to his wife. The two sisters are in charge of the household. This time, upon hearing that a monthly grain consumption plan was to be formulated, he felt that he had to understand the situation at home first and have a clear idea. So, during this period, he went home more often than before and paid attention to checking the family's grain purchase certificates and consciously calculating the household accounts with his family, asking clearly how much the monthly rent and utility bills were, how much the grain purchase money was, and how much the vegetable money was. After such careful calculation, he had a basic idea of how much grain the family used each month.

From the grain purchase certificates and the money spent on buying grain each month, his family used to buy more than 70 jin of coarse and fine grains combined each month. Was there any waste in this? He kept an eye on the cooking situation at home and carefully studied it with his family. His wife and her younger sister initially denied that there was any waste at home. He brought up his observations and discussed them with them. In the past, it was always difficult to cook the exact amount of food needed, and sometimes there would be some leftovers. When there was an extra bowl or half a bowl of rice, they would share it. Sometimes he would come home for dinner late after a meeting. If the family was eating cornbread that day, they would make noodles for him separately. If he couldn't finish it, the family would share it again. The leftover food from the child was sometimes eaten by them and sometimes used to make sauce. They thought, "Anyway, it goes into the stomach, how can that be called waste?" He patiently explained the meaning of saving grain to them. After repeated explanations, they also agreed with his point of view and said that in the future, they would be mindful when cooking and try to make sure there was neither too much nor too little. They also educated and managed the child, making him understand that leaving food and spilling food was not good, and telling him to serve less food each time when eating, and to use a bowl to hold steamed buns and cornbread to prevent crumbs from falling on the ground.

When the neighborhood publicized the significance and methods of verifying and supplying grain on a household basis and asked each family to formally formulate a plan, some confused ideas and resistance arose in Lin Ruqi's family. Only his wife went to the residents' meeting. After listening to the propagandist's report, she didn't understand what was going on and only remembered a few sentences when she got home. Lin Ruqi asked her what she had heard, and she said, "I only heard that you have to plan your meals." When asked if it was good to make a plan, she said, "What's so good about that? It's too troublesome to plan your meals!" When asked why a plan was needed, she said, "I only heard that it's good for the country and good for ourselves." She couldn't say what those benefits were. After learning about this situation, Lin Ruqi went home from work and explained the contents of the propaganda outline to them in detail. They all came from the countryside and understood that grain was not easy to come by, and they also understood the benefits of the state controlling grain to stabilize grain prices. Therefore, after a detailed explanation of the principles of formulating a plan, they also accepted it ideologically. Although they understood the principles, problems arose when formulating a specific plan. According to the regulations, the June grain consumption plan should be formulated with reference to the average grain consumption from January to May and the actual situation in June. However, Lin Ruqi's family only returned from the Shandong countryside in May this year, and there was no grain purchase amount from January to May on the grain purchase certificate. How should the plan be formulated? Lin Ruqi advocated actually calculating it, but his wife said, "Just write a number casually when you plan." Lin Ruqi said that wouldn't work, and she said, "It's the same whether you calculate it or not, big mouthfuls and small mouthfuls, three dou per month." She also said, "We don't have good dishes to eat, so we mainly eat grain." "We haven't weighed it when cooking in the past, we just estimated with a small ladle. If we want to calculate the bill, we have to buy a scale." "The child doesn't eat at fixed times, so it's not easy to calculate."… Lin Ruqi felt that if these ideological problems were not solved, the plan would not be formulated well, so he took the time to explain to them why it was necessary to be realistic when formulating a plan, and how calculating the accounts could be realistic. After explaining it several times, they also knew that it was not good for the country to order too much, and that they were family members of staff members and should not order too much. But they also said, "We'll wait until others have ordered, and then we'll see how others order." It turned out that they were afraid of being scolded by their neighbors if they ordered too little. Lin Ruqi understood their concerns in his usual chats, so he patiently persuaded them, making them realize that it was right to order early and order realistically, and it was wrong to be afraid of being scolded by others.

After eliminating their main ideological concerns, Lin Ruqi helped them calculate the detailed accounts. His wife ate a mix of coarse and fine grains every month, and twenty-three or four jin was enough. His wife's younger sister was engaged in household handicrafts and needed twenty-eight jin per month. The child was five years old, and although he ate more meals, sometimes he ate an egg, sometimes he ate some biscuits, and sometimes he bought some soy milk in the morning. These should not be included in the grain consumption plan. According to his normal eating amount, he ate at most thirteen jin per month. Lin Ruqi ate at home every Sunday, and he also ate at home five or six times a month on weekdays. In order to make the grain consumption plans at home and in the office more accurate, he thought that in the future, he would try not to eat at home on weekdays except on Sundays. Three to four jin at home would be enough. In this way, the whole family combined ordered a plan of sixty-eight jin of grain for June, which was ten jin less than the average monthly amount last year. As long as there was no waste, this was completely enough to eat.

When formulating the July plan, because it was hot and it was estimated that the food intake would decrease, another two jin were reduced, and only sixty-six jin were ordered. About two jin and two liang of grain were cooked every day, and everyone was full. Lin Ruqi helped with cooking at home for two Sundays, and a nineteen-year-old nephew came, and he only ate two jin and five liang of grain a day. According to the calculation on July 23, there may be a surplus of one or two jin by the end of the month.

Lin Ruqi's family's grain consumption plan was ordered earlier and ordered less than the families in the same courtyard. When it was first ordered, the neighbors said to Lin Ruqi's wife that it must not be enough to eat. Lin Ruqi's wife now understood that she was right, so she calculated the detailed accounts for them one by one, telling them to also calculate their accounts well and order more realistically. Lin Ruqi sometimes talked to the neighbors in the same courtyard about ordering plans when he was at home. Under the influence of his family, the nearby residents also ordered plans that were more realistic.

    林汝麒是怎样帮助家庭订用粮计划的
    王一平
    林汝麒是北京市西四区区工会的党支部书记。今年五月末，当北京市整顿粮食统销工作，要实行按户定量核实供应的时候，他想：这是党的政策，我是一个工作人员，又是一个党员，一定要带头执行，首先要把自己家里的用粮计划订好。他家里除了他还有他的妻子、一个五岁的孩子和妻子的妹妹。他自己住在机关里，星期日才回家，平时他并不过问家里油盐柴米的事，发了薪金，扣去自己伙食和零用钱，其余都交给妻子，家里是她们姊妹俩当家。这回听说要按月订用粮计划，他感到先要摸清家里的底，心中有数才行。于是这一阶段他回家就比以往勤一些，回家就注意翻看家里的购粮证，还有意识地和家里人算算家用帐，问清楚每月房租水电费多少、买粮钱多少、菜钱多少。经过这样细算，家里每月大约用多少粮食，他心里就有个底了。
    从购粮证上和每月买粮用的钱计算，他家过去每月粗粮细粮合计要买七十多斤。这里面有没有浪费呢？他一方面留心家里的做饭情况，一方面和家里人仔细研究。他妻子和小姨起初都不承认家里有浪费。他就把自己观察到的情况提出来同她们谈。过去家里做饭总不容易做得刚刚准确，有时就会剩下一些；当多出一碗或半碗饭时，她们就分吃了。有时他出去开会迟了就回家吃饭；如果那顿家里人吃的是窝窝头，就另给他做面吃，他吃不完的，家里人又分吃了。小孩子剩下的饭，有时她们吃了，有时用来做酱。她们认为：“反正吃到肚里去了呗，怎能叫浪费？”他又耐心地同她们谈节约粮食的意义；经过多次解释，她们也同意了他的看法，说以后做饭要有数，尽量做到不多不少。对孩子也进行了教育和管理，使他知道剩饭、撒饭是不好的事，叫他吃饭时每次少盛些，吃馒头和窝窝头也给他用碗盛，免得屑子撒落在地上。
    街道上宣传了按户核实供应粮食的意义和办法，要各家正式订计划的时候，林汝麒的家里的人又产生了一些糊涂思想和抵触情绪。居民开会时只有他妻子去了。她听了宣传员报告以后，并没有弄懂是怎么一回事，到家就只记得几句话了。林汝麒问她听了些什么，她说：“就听到吃饭要订计划。”问她订计划好不好，她说：“这有什么好呀？吃饭都要计划，麻烦死了！”问她为什么要订计划，她说：“只听到说对国家有好处，对自己也有好处。”有那些好处，她也说不上来。林汝麒了解到这个情况，下班回家就根据宣传提纲的内容向她们详细讲了一遍。她们都是从农村来的，懂得粮食来得不易，也懂得国家掌握粮食稳定粮价的好处。因此，关于订计划的道理，经过详细讲解以后，她们在思想上也接受了。道理虽然懂了，可是具体订计划的时候问题又来了。按照规定，应该参照一月到五月的平均用粮数和六月份的实际情况订出六月份用粮计划。可是，林汝麒的家属今年五月才从山东乡下回来，购粮证上没有今年一月到五月的购粮数。计划怎样定呢？林汝麒主张实际算一算，他妻子却说：“要计划就随便写个数去。”林汝麒说不行，她说：“算不算都一样，大口小口，一月三斗。”又说：“我们没好菜吃，是吃粮为主。”“过去做饭也没称过，都是用小瓢约约，要算帐还得买个秤。”“小孩吃饭没顿数，不好算。”……林汝麒感到这些思想问题不解决，计划一定订不好，就抽出时间对她们讲清楚订计划为什么要切合实际，怎样算帐就能切合实际。讲了几次，她们也知道订多了对国家不好，自己是工作人员家属，不应该多订。但是她们又说：“等人家订了，我们看看别人怎样订的再说。”原来她们是怕订少了会挨邻居骂。林汝麒在平时闲谈中了解了她们的顾虑，就耐心地进行说服，使她们认识到自己早些订出来，订得实际是对的，怕别人骂是不对的。
    把她们的主要思想顾虑消除以后，林汝麒又帮她们算细帐。她妻子每月粗细粮搭配吃，有二十三、四斤就够了；妻子的妹妹从事家庭手工业，每月需要二十八斤；小孩五岁，虽然吃的顿数多些，但有时吃一个鸡蛋，有时吃点饼干，有时早上还买点豆浆，这些都不能算在用粮计划内，按他正常吃饭量计算，每月最多吃十三斤；林汝麒每个星期日在家吃饭，平时一个月也有五、六顿在家吃的，为了使家里和机关里用粮计划都订得准确些，他想以后除了星期日，平时尽可能不在家吃，在家里有三斤到四斤就够了。这样全家合起来，订了六月份用粮六十八斤的计划，比去年每月平均数减少十斤。只要不浪费，这是完全够吃的。
    订七月份计划时，因为天热，估计食量会减少又减了两斤，只订了六十六斤。每天大约按二斤二两粮食做饭，大家都吃饱了。有两个星期日林汝麒在家帮助做饭，还来了一个十九岁的内侄，一天才吃了二斤五两粮食。根据七月二十三日计算，到月底可能还会节余一、二斤粮食。
    林汝麒家的用粮计划比同院的人家订得早、订得少。刚订出来时，邻居就对林汝麒的妻子说：一定不够吃。林汝麒的妻子这时已经懂得了自己是对的，就把细帐一笔一笔算给他们听，叫他们也好好算算帐，订实际一点。林汝麒在家时有时也和同院的邻居谈谈订计划的事。在他家的影响下，附近的居民也订出了比较切合实际的计划。（附图片）
