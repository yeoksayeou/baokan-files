    Important Export Goods – Pig Bristles
    Wu Jingdi
    Pig bristles are the best raw material for making machine brushes, gun and cannon brushes, paint brushes, and daily cleaning brushes. Chinese pig bristles have outstanding advantages in terms of color, elasticity, hardness, and length. The bristles are strong, highly elastic, and have deep forked tips, all of which are essential conditions for manufacturing various excellent brushes.

    Since liberation, many improvements have been made in the production and processing of pig bristles. Processing procedures for pig bristles have been researched and formulated, and assembly line operations have been implemented, which has improved the quantity and quality of production. The cleaning and disinfection of pig bristles during processing has been strengthened, ensuring the health of workers. This has reduced production costs and improved product quality, further enhancing the reputation of Chinese pig bristles in the international market.

      From 1950 to 1954, the value of pig bristle exports could be exchanged for more than 1.24 million tons of steel.

    In China's pig bristle production, black bristles account for about 80 percent, while white bristles account for only about 10 percent. However, white bristles have a wider range of uses than black bristles, and their export value is also higher. Therefore, the production of white bristles should be appropriately developed. At the same time, we must conserve the domestic consumption of white bristles and free them up for export, to exchange for more industrial construction materials. This issue should be given special attention in Sichuan, Hunan, Northeast China and other white bristle producing areas.

    重要的出口物资——猪鬃
    吴景棣
    猪鬃是制造机器刷、枪炮刷、油漆刷及日用清洁刷最好的原料。中国的猪鬃，无论在色泽、弹性、硬度、长度等各方面，都具有特出的优点。鬃干壮，弹力大，尖端分叉较深，这些都是制造各种优良刷子的主要条件。
    解放后，猪鬃的生产和加工方面都做了许多改进，研究并制定了猪鬃加工操作程序，实行了流水作业法，提高了生产的数量和质量。加强了猪鬃在加工过程中的清洁及消毒，保障了工人们的身体健康。因而降低了生产成本，产品质量也有所提高，更提高了我国猪鬃在国际市场上的信誉。
      一九五○年到一九五四年五年来猪鬃出口的价值约可换得钢材一百二十四万余吨。
    我国猪鬃产量中，黑鬃约占百分之八十，白鬃仅占百分之十左右，而白鬃的用途较黑鬃广，出口价值也较黑鬃值钱，因此一方面应适当地发展白鬃生产。同时，还要节约国内白鬃用量，腾出来出口，更多的换取工业建设物资。特别是在四川、湖南、东北等白鬃产地更应注意这个问题。
