    A Proactive Food-Saving Staff Member's Family
    Liang Minzhi

    Huang Huiming is the wife of Chen Zhenyu, a staff member at the Changsha Main Station of the Hunan Provincial Transportation Bureau. She took the lead in helping her whole family carefully plan their grain consumption and save food, and was commended by the Changsha Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. After listening to the report by the vice chairman of the Changsha Main Station Trade Union on promoting planned grain consumption, Huang Huiming thought on her way home: As a staff member's family member, with her husband away on a business trip, she must take the lead this time as the Party and government call on urban residents to consume grain according to plan. That evening, she discussed it with her father and mother, who were in their seventies. She asked her father:
  "Dad, how much rice does our family eat in a month? Now the government wants each household to make a grain consumption plan based on actual needs, saving food to support national construction. What do you think of the plan?" The old man thought for a moment and replied, "What plan? Our family is already saving as much as possible. We eat porridge for one meal and rice for two meals every day. What else can we save? We eat less in hot weather, and we will eat more when it gets cold. If we make a plan, it will be difficult to buy more in the future. Let's plan for 270 catties." Huang Huiming immediately patiently explained the reasons to her father, explaining the significance and benefits of saving food. After her explanation, her father also felt that she was right. However, the old man always wanted to be "stable" in his actions. He said, "In my opinion, let's still plan for 270 catties a month. If we can't eat that much, we'll guarantee to return it to the government." Huang Huiming understood the old man's psychology and further explained, "The 'three fix' method for grain has been implemented in rural areas. The amount of grain farmers sell to the state is fixed, and the amount of grain the government supplies must also be fixed. If each household in our Changsha Main Station and other urban residents buys ten or twenty catties more grain each month, the number will be staggering. Where will the state get so much grain to supply everyone?"
    The old man's thinking was cleared, but because he had not specifically calculated, he did not know exactly how much grain the family ate every day, so he was still a little worried. Huang Huiming then calculated with him the detailed account of the family's excessive grain consumption in May and where grain could be saved. The next day, she and her father estimated the amount of rice each member of the family ate per day—eight adults and four children in the family, averaging eleven taels of rice per person per day. Her family tried to use grain according to this standard. As a result, everyone was full, and there was still more than a bowl of rice left. Her father fully approved of this "standard"; however, Huang Huiming felt that this "standard" was still a bit high. The next day, she and her father tried again with a quantity of slightly more than ten taels per person per day, and the result was slightly short. On June 9, they experimented again with a quantity of about ten taels and five qian per person, which was just right, and the whole family was full. Therefore, her family officially made a grain consumption plan according to this standard.
    Huang Huiming knew that after making a plan, it would still not be easy to implement. She often paid attention to educating her children not to waste food, and she and the nanny studied ways to improve cooking methods. According to the newly made grain consumption plan, her family eats more than 120 taels of rice every day, all measured with fixed measuring cylinders: porridge for breakfast uses about eighteen taels of rice, cooked neither thick nor thin; about fifty-three taels each for lunch and dinner. When cooking rice, add a fixed amount of water, and when the rice blooms, take it off the fire for a while to let the rice grains absorb enough water before pouring it into the steamer to steam. Each catty of rice yields three catties and six taels to three catties and eight taels of rice, and the rice grains are just right, neither hard nor mushy.
    After implementing this grain consumption plan, Huang Huiming's family can save thirty-eight and a half catties of rice and save more than three yuan per month compared with the past. Now, their whole family has begun to develop the habit of saving food. In these twenty days of planned grain consumption, they have never exceeded the planned grain consumption figure, and the whole family is full.

    一个积极节约粮食的工作人员家属
    梁敏之
    黄慧明是湖南省运输局长沙总站工作人员陈震宇的妻子。她带动全家认真订好用粮计划，节约粮食，受到了长沙市工会联合会的表扬。黄慧明听了长沙总站工会副主席关于推行计划用粮的报告后，在回家的路上心里就盘算着：自己是一个工作人员家属，丈夫出差没回来，这次党和政府号召城市人民按计划用粮，自己一定要起带头作用。晚上，她便同七十多岁的爹爹、妈妈商量起来。她问爹爹说：
  “爹，我们家里一个月要吃多少米呀？如今政府要我们每户按实际需要订出用粮计划，节约粮食支援国家建设，你老看计划怎么订呀？”老人想了一下，回答道：“计划什么？我们家里节约得差不多了。如今每天吃一餐稀饭、两餐干饭，还有什么可节约的？热天吃得少，日后天冷时，就会吃得多。订了计划将来不好多买；要订就订二百七十斤吧。”黄慧明立即向她爹耐心地说明道理，说明节约粮食的意义和好处。经过她的解释，她爹也觉得很对。但老人家做事总想“稳当”点，他说：“依我看，我们还是照二百七十斤一月订计划吧，吃不了这么多，保证退给政府就是。”黄慧明懂得老人家的心理，又进一步解释：“农村里实行了粮食‘三定’办法，农民卖给国家的粮食数量定下来了，政府供应粮食的数量不能不定下来。我们长沙总站和别的城市居民如果每户每个月多买十斤、二十斤粮食，数目就是很惊人的，国家从哪里弄那么多粮食供应大家？”
    老人家的思想通了，不过因没有具体计算过，不知道家里每天到底要吃多少粮，总还有点不放心。黄慧明就又同他算了算家里五月份多耗费粮食的细账和可以节约粮食的地方。第二天，她又同她爹一道估出了全家每人每天的饭量——全家大人八口，小孩四口，平均每人每天吃十一两米。她家就按这个标准试用粮食。结果，每人都吃饱了，还剩下一碗多饭。她爹满口赞成这个“标准”；可是，黄慧明觉得这个“标准”还高了一些。第二天，她又和爹按每人每天十两多一点的数量试了一天，结果，稍差一点。六月九日，再按每人大约十两五钱的数量来试验，恰好不多不少，全家都吃得饱饱的。于是，她家就按这个标准正式订出了用粮计划。
    黄慧明知道，订出计划以后，执行起来还是不容易的。她经常注意教育小孩不要浪费粮食，并且同保姆一道研究改进煮饭方法。按新订的用粮计划，她家每天吃一百二十多两米，都用一定的筒子量：早饭煮稀饭用米十八两左右，煮得不浓不稀的；中、晚饭各约五十三两。煮饭时放定量的水，米开了花时就端开歇一下火，让米粒吸饱水分再倒进甑里去蒸，每斤米出饭三斤六两至三斤八两，饭粒不硬不烂正合适。
    执行这个用粮计划后，黄慧明家每个月用粮情况和过去比较，可以节约三十八斤半米，节省下三元多。现在，她们一家人都开始养成了节约粮食的习惯，在这按计划用粮的二十来天中，从来没有那天超过了计划用粮数字，全家个个吃得饱。
