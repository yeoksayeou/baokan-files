Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: The Yugoslav "Kolo" Folk Dance Troupe was warmly welcomed by thousands of capital literary and art workers at the Beijing Railway Station today, which was decorated with the national flags of China and Yugoslavia.

The dance troupe, headed by O. Skovran, consists of fifty-four members. This is the first artistic group from the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia to visit China. The dance troupe will be in China for a friendly visit and performances lasting one and a half months.

At 6:20 p.m., when the train carrying the dance troupe arrived, warm applause and cheers erupted at the station. The people of the capital expressed a warm welcome to the guests from the distant Balkan Peninsula.

As soon as the guests got off the train, two young people rushed forward to present two bouquets of flowers to the head of the dance troupe, Skovran. Subsequently, a flower presentation team composed of seventy young literary and art workers from the capital presented flowers to all members of the dance troupe to pay their respects. At this time, each of the guests held a bouquet of blooming flowers, smiling and shaking hands with the welcoming people. Among those in the welcoming line were Xia Yan, Vice Minister of Culture; He Wei, Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs; Chen Zhongjing, Acting Director of the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations; Wang Kunlun, Deputy Mayor of Beijing; Yang Hansheng, Secretary-General of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, as well as the Ambassador of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia to China, Popovic, and embassy staff.

A grand welcome meeting was then held at the station.

When the dance troupe members and countless welcoming masses met in the temporary venue adorned with the Chinese and Yugoslav national flags and a huge banner welcoming the dance troupe, flowers waved, applause thundered, and cheers followed one after another. Many members of the dance troupe walked up to the welcoming crowd and shook hands warmly with the cheering people.

Xia Yan, Vice Minister of Culture, delivered a speech at the welcome meeting, welcoming all members of the dance troupe. He said that through this visit and performance of the Yugoslav "Kolo" Folk Dance Troupe in China, the mutual understanding and friendly cooperation between the people of China and Yugoslavia will surely be strengthened, and this friendly cooperation is undoubtedly a great force for safeguarding world peace. The Yugoslav "Kolo" Dance Troupe is a famous folk dance troupe in the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, and it has many famous folk dancers and musicians. You will bring us many Yugoslav folk dance and music programs with national traditions and rich colors. I believe that these programs will be loved and welcomed by our people.

When the head of the dance troupe, Skovran, spoke, applause and cheers resounded throughout the station. Skovran said: We have long heard that the Chinese people have a traditional spirit of hospitality. When we set foot on Chinese soil and met the Chinese people for the first time, this was fully proven. We believe that you are treating us as your closest friends.

Skovran said: Our visit to your country, as well as future mutual visits between Yugoslavia and China, will undoubtedly play a huge role in enhancing the friendship and mutual understanding between the people of the two countries.

Skovran's speech was interrupted time and time again by enthusiastic applause and cheers.

Finally, when Xia Yan and others accompanied Skovran and all members of the dance troupe out of the platform, the welcoming people lined up on the platform and applauded to welcome them. Members of the dance troupe shook hands cordially with the enthusiastic welcoming masses, and some members returned the flowers to the welcoming people. (Attached picture)
