Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 10th (via TASS): United Press International correspondent Sexton in Geneva reported on the Soviet exhibition at the Geneva Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy. He said that the Soviet exhibition displayed "various outstanding devices for generating electricity, treating cancer, inspecting rolling mills, and even calculating wine bottles." This surprised scientists from the other seventy-one countries participating in the conference. "Russia demonstrated its atomic energy equipment, earning all the glory of the first day... Scientists from the United States, Britain, and other countries admitted that the Soviet exhibition proves that the Soviet Union has achieved extraordinary and unexpected achievements in the application of atomic energy in medicine, industry, and agriculture."

The UPI reporter said: "Doubt, disbelief, and secrecy have obviously been eliminated, because the Russians gave detailed explanations to the Americans, British, French, and Germans visiting the exhibition."

    新华社十日讯　据塔斯社纽约九日讯：合众社驻日内瓦记者塞克斯顿报道了日内瓦和平利用原子能展览会的苏联展览馆情况。他说，苏联展览馆展出了“生产电能、治疗癌症、检查轧钢机、甚至计算酒瓶用的各种卓越的器械”。这使得参加会议的其他七十一个国家的科学家感到惊奇。“俄国展示了自己的原子能器械，博得了第一天的全部光荣……美国、英国和其他国家的科学家承认，苏联的展览馆证明，苏联在医学、工业、农业上利用原子能这方面获得了不平凡的和出人意外的成就。”
    合众社记者说：“怀疑、不相信、秘密感显然都消除了，因为俄国人对参观展览馆的美国人、英国人、法国人和德国人作了详尽的解释。”
