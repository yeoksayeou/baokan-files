　　The Power of the People

    Hidden counter-revolutionaries are the most dangerous enemies of our country and our people. If we do not thoroughly eliminate these enemies, our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation will suffer serious damage. Therefore, eliminating all counter-revolutionaries has become the unanimous demand of the broad masses of people. This demand of the people has now converged into an irresistible force. No matter how cleverly the counter-revolutionaries disguise themselves, they cannot escape the dragnet laid by the masses.
    In Jiange County, Sichuan Province, there was a young militiaman named Liang Chiyuan. One day, he went to his neighbor Liang Shishen's house to invite people to go hunting together. He accidentally discovered a hole in the wall of the house. A bowl was placed at the opening of the hole, with a pair of chopsticks resting on the bowl, and some uneaten corn flour was smeared on the edge of the bowl. Liang Chiyuan found it strange: all five members of his family were eating on the porch, so why was there an extra bowl and chopsticks? Was it a cat's bowl? Why were there also chopsticks? Was there another person? And who was this person? And why didn't he show his face? Suddenly, he remembered an incident from two years ago. At that time, the village had held a public trial of the Kuomintang secret agent Yang Jiuling. After the meeting, this secret agent went into hiding. Yang Jiuling was a relative of Liang Shishen's family. Could this bowl and chopsticks be related to him? Liang Chiyuan made up his mind to get to the bottom of this matter. On this day, he pretended to be hunting muntjacs and quietly wandered around the slope behind Liang Shishen's house. After dark, he followed the mountain ditch leading to Liang Shishen's door and climbed to the pond. He saw Liang Shishen's family of five eating dinner. He waited quietly for a long time, and suddenly he heard the sound of the stairs in the bedroom. Then a tall man with hair hanging down to his shoulders appeared. A moment later, this man stepped into the room and disappeared.
    On the way home, he walked and wondered: who was this strange man? Was it Yang Jiuling? And how could he have been hiding for more than two years?
    On the third day, the weather was sultry, and Liang Chiyuan had an idea: maybe the strange man would come out to cool off. When it got dark, he went to lie in the grass and wait again. Soon, the strange man came out of the kitchen and stayed on the porch talking to Liang Shishen. Liang Chiyuan saw clearly by the light that this strange man was none other than the heinous counter-revolutionary Yang Jiuling. Liang Chiyuan reported this news to the self-defense captain, and the counter-revolutionary Yang Jiuling, who had been hiding for more than two years, was finally captured alive.
    Counter-revolutionaries always try to disguise themselves as good people and deceive the eyes of the people. However, since they want to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, it is absolutely impossible for them to leave no traces. After the eyes of the masses are sharpened, these traces will be discovered by the masses.
    The masses can trace the clues of counter-revolutionaries from a sentence they hear and a strange phenomenon they see. Such a thing once happened in Tianjin:
    There was a housewife named Sun Yulan in Huayuan West Street, Jiefang Road, Tianjin. In her neighbor's yard lived a man named Zhang Wanlu, who had just returned from Hong Kong. Sun Yulan heard that Zhang Wanlu had returned because he was unemployed and unable to live abroad; however, after returning home, he did not look for a job, but ate and drank all day long, and associated with some hooligans. Sun Yulan secretly thought: where did Zhang Wanlu get this money to spend? Wasn't he unemployed? Not long after, Sun Yulan suddenly heard the postman shout that money had been remitted to Zhang's house, and Zhang Wanlu was asked to take his chop to collect the money, and she heard that it was more than one hundred yuan. Where did so much money come from? Who remitted it? Many questions whirled in Sun Yulan's mind. Since then, she has become more vigilant. She and another woman, Mi Shulan (who lived in the same yard as Zhang Wanlu), often paid attention to Zhang Wanlu's actions together. One day, they suddenly discovered that Zhang Wanlu was using plain water to write on a piece of paper with writing on it, and he hurriedly hid the paper under his buttocks when he saw someone outside the window. These situations made them even more suspicious, so they reported the activities of Zhang Wanlu that they had heard and seen to the public security organs. After investigation, it turned out that this Zhang Wanlu was a special agent sent by the US-Chiang Kai-shek special service agency from Hong Kong to the mainland to collect intelligence and carry out sabotage activities.
    The following also happened in Beijing:
    One cold morning, two strange middle-aged men walked into the house of Wu Deyuan, a young seal-carving worker (who set up a seal-carving stall). One of them, a fat man wearing a blue leather jacket, said that he wanted to carve a personal seal with a name on it. This was a very ordinary thing, but this person's attitude was unusually unnatural. After completing the formalities, the fat man suddenly brought his face close and whispered to Wu Deyuan: "Do you carve big ones?" Wu Deyuan replied: "I carve all kinds of seals." "Then, we will come after discussing it with the leadership." The fat man exchanged glances with another thin man in a cyan cotton uniform and left in a hurry. After about two hours, these two guys came again, and their attitude was very polite. The fat man handed Wu Deyuan a cigarette and said with a smile, "I see you are really a good friend, how about we become friends?" "We people in this kind of industry, how can we not make friends, okay!" Wu Deyuan replied readily. "Making friends means helping each other." The fat man seized the opportunity and said, "We want to carve an official seal. As long as you carve it, your life will not be a problem in the future!" As he spoke, he took out a large stack of RMB from his pocket and flashed it in front of Wu Deyuan. At this time, the thin man glared at him and said fiercely:
    "We know that you people have contact with the Public Security Bureau. Anyway, there is no death penalty for privately carving seals. If you publicize this matter, don't expect to live after we get out of court!" Wu Deyuan pretended to be sincere and promised with a look of timidity, which satisfied the two men. The fat man asked Wu Deyuan: "When should we come to pick it up?" Wu Deyuan thought for a while and said: "Nine o'clock tomorrow night, it will be quieter, and it will be convenient for you to come."
    After Wu Deyuan waited for them to leave, he pretended to be nonchalant and deliberately picked up two buckets to fetch water, observing whether the two men were secretly monitoring him as he walked. Not finding anyone, he put down the buckets by the well and ran to the police station to report. The next night, the comrades from the police station arrested the two guys in Wu Deyuan's home and a hotel. Later, it was found that one of these two people was a fugitive landlord and the other was a reactionary Kuomintang officer. They privately carved official seals and forged certificates, attempting to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks to carry out sabotage activities.
    In this way, Wu Deyuan, in his ordinary seal-carving position, used his courage and wit to prevent many counter-revolutionaries, illegal merchants, and rogue thieves from seriously sabotaging the country's socialist construction and the people's lives. In the struggle against various saboteurs, he was not deceived by the tricks of the bad elements, nor was he shaken by the temptation of money or the threat of force. In the years since liberation, he has reported a total of more than 280 counter-revolutionaries and various criminal offenders who privately carved official seals.
    The above facts vividly illustrate that in order to thoroughly and cleanly eliminate all counter-revolutionaries, it is necessary not only to rely on the correct leadership of the leading organs, but also to have the high awareness of the masses and their active participation in the struggle. Every victory we have achieved in the struggle against counter-revolutionaries in the past few years has directly or indirectly received the support and help of the masses. The masses have provided a large number of clues and reliable evidence, and assisted the national public security organs in solving many difficult cases. This conscious action of the masses has left counter-revolutionaries with nowhere to hide. In the future, to achieve greater victories on this front, until all hidden counter-revolutionaries are eliminated, it is necessary to extensively and deeply mobilize the masses. As long as the eyes of the masses are sharpened and their enthusiasm for struggle is brought into play, no cunning counter-revolutionary can escape, and we will certainly be able to completely eliminate all hidden enemies.

    暗藏的反革命分子是我们国家和人民的最危险的敌人。不把这些敌人彻底肃清，我们国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业就会遭受严重的损害。因此，肃清一切反革命分子就成为广大人民的一致要求。人民的这种要求，现在已经汇成了一股不可抗拒的力量，不管反革命分子伪装得如何巧妙，总逃不出人民群众布下的天罗地网。
    四川剑阁县有个青年民兵叫梁池元。一天，他到邻居梁仕伸家约人共同去打猎，偶然发现这家墙壁上有个洞，洞口放着一只碗，碗上架着一双筷子，碗边上还敷着没有吃净的包谷面。梁池元奇怪起来：他家五口人全都在阶檐上吃饭，怎么又多了一双碗筷呢？是猫儿碗吗？为什么还有一双筷子？还有另外一个人吗？那么这个人是谁呢？而且为什么不露面呢？忽然间，他想起两年以前一件事。那时村上开过公审军统特务杨九龄的大会。会后这个特务就潜逃了。杨九龄和梁仕伸家是亲戚，莫非这双碗筷和他有关？梁池元打定主意，一定要把这件事弄个明白。这一天他就装着打麂的样子，悄悄地在梁仕伸屋后坡上蹓来蹓去，等到天黑以后，就顺着通往梁仕伸门口的山沟，爬到塘边一看，梁仕伸一家五口正在吃晚饭。他静静地等了许久，忽听睡房里的楼梯响了，接着出现了一个身材高大、头发直披到肩上的人，一会儿，这人又跨进房门不见了。
    在回家的路上，他一路走一路猜想：这个怪人是谁呢？是杨九龄吗？又怎么会藏得住两年多呢？
    第三天，天气闷热，梁池元心头有了个想法：那个怪人也许会出来乘凉。天黑时，他又去伏在茅草丛里等候。不久，果然那个怪人由灶房转了出来，呆在阶檐上同梁仕伸谈话。梁池元借着灯光看实在了，这个怪人正是罪大恶极的反革命分子杨九龄。梁池元把这个消息报告了自卫队长，隐藏了两年多的反革命分子杨九龄终于被活捉了。
    反革命分子总是想把自己装扮成好人，蒙蔽人民的眼睛。但是，他们既要进行反革命的活动，就绝对不可能毫无形迹。在群众的眼睛擦亮以后，这些形迹就都会被群众发现。
    群众可以从自己听到的一句和看到的一个奇怪现象里，追究出反革命分子的线索。在天津就曾发生这样的一件事情：
    天津市解放路花园西街有个家庭妇女叫孙玉兰。在她的邻院里住着一个新从香港回来的人叫张万禄。孙玉兰听说，张万禄是因为在外失业没法生活而回来的；可是他回家以后，却不找事做，成天大吃大喝，还同一些流氓来来往往。孙玉兰暗暗地想：张万禄哪里来的这些钱花？他不是失了业的么？事隔不久，孙玉兰忽然听邮局投递员喊，给张家汇钱来了，要张万禄带上手戳去领款，并听说是一百多元。从哪里汇来这许多钱？是谁给汇来的？许多疑问在孙玉兰的脑子里打转。自此以后，她更加警惕了。她和另一妇女米淑兰（同张万禄住一个院）经常共同注意观察张万禄的行动。一天，她们忽然发现张万禄用白水在一张写了字的信纸上写字，并且一见窗外有人，就慌慌张张把信纸藏到屁股底下。这些情况使她们越发怀疑了，于是她们把前前后后所听到的看到的有关张万禄的活动情况，报告了公安机关。经过侦察，原来这个张万禄是美蒋特务机关从香港派来大陆搜集情报、进行破坏活动的特务。
    北京也发生了这样一件事：
    一个冷天的早晨，有两个陌生的中年人走进了青年刻字工人（摆刻字摊的）吴德元的屋里。其中有一个穿蓝色小皮袄的胖子，说他要刻一个人名私章。这本来是件很平常的事，可是这人的态度却异样不自然。在办妥手续以后，那个胖子突然把脸凑过去，轻声问吴德元：“大的刻不刻？”吴德元回答：“什么图章都刻。”“那么，我们同领导上研究一下就来。”胖子和另一个穿青色棉制服的瘦个子交换了一下眼色，就匆匆地出去了。过了两个钟头左右，这两个家伙果然又来了，态度非常客气。胖子递给吴德元一支香烟，笑着说：“看你真够朋友，咱们交个朋友好不好？”“咱们做这种行业的人，那里不交朋友，行！”吴德元爽快地回答。“交朋友就得帮个忙。”胖子抓紧机会说，“我们要刻一个公章，只要你给刻，你以后的生活就不成问题！”说着就从衣袋里掏出一大叠人民币在吴德元眼前一晃。那瘦个子这时却瞪起了眼，凶狠地对他说：
  “知道你们这些人同公安局有联系，反正私刻图章没有枪毙的罪，你要是把这件事声张出去，等我们出了法院，你就不用打算活！”吴德元装出一副诚恳应诺的面孔和看来十分胆怯的神情，使这两个人心满意足了。胖子问吴德元：“什么时候来取？”吴德元考虑了一下说：“明天晚上九点钟吧，清静一些，你们来时也方便。”
  　吴德元等他们走了以后，就装着无事的模样故意挑着两个水桶去挑水，边走边观察那两人是不是在暗地里监视自己。没有发现人影，他就在井边放下水桶，一溜烟跑到派出所报告了。第二天晚上，派出所同志在吴德元家中和某旅馆中分别把那两个家伙逮捕了。后来查明，这两个人一个是逃亡地主，一个是国民党的反动军官。他们私刻公章，伪造证明，是企图混进革命阵营内部进行破坏活动。
    就是这样，吴德元在他的平凡的刻字岗位上，用他的勇敢和机智，防止了许许多多反革命分子、不法商人和流氓盗窃分子对国家社会主义建设和人民生活的严重破坏。他在同各类破坏分子进行斗争中，没有被坏分子的花招所蒙蔽，也没有因金钱的引诱或强力的威吓所动摇。他在解放以来的几年中，一共检举了二百八十多个私刻公章的反革命分子和各类刑事罪犯。
    以上这些事实生动地说明：要想彻底干净地肃清一切反革命分子，不仅要依靠领导机关的正确领导，而且还必须有人民群众的高度觉悟和积极参加斗争才能办到。过去几年来我们同反革命分子进行斗争所取得的每一胜利，都直接间接地取得了人民群众的支持和帮助。人民群众提供了大量的线索和可靠的证据，并协助国家公安保卫机关破获了许多难以破获的案件。人民群众的这种自觉行动，使反革命分子没有藏身之地。今后，要在这条战线上取得更大的胜利，直至肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，就必须广泛深入地发动群众。只要群众眼睛擦亮了，斗争积极性发挥了，任何狡猾的反革命分子都难以逃脱，我们一定能把一切暗藏的敌人彻底消灭干净。
