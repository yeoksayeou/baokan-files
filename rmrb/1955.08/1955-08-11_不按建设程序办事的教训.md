Emphasize Comprehensive Economy and Overcome All Waste

Lessons from Disregarding Construction Procedures
    Zhu Li

In industrial capital construction, accelerating the construction speed as much as possible under economic principles and possible conditions is of great significance to the development of the national economy. Because accelerating the construction speed can not only enable fixed assets to be put into use earlier to increase production capacity, but also accelerate the turnover of national investment and avoid long-term accumulation of useful funds in projects that cannot be put into production. At the same time, accelerating the construction speed of projects can also relatively save a lot of expenses. At present, China's coal production is far from catching up with the growth of demand. Therefore, for the coal mine construction of the advanced industry, it is more necessary to take all possible measures that must be based on economic principles to speed up the construction speed to meet the needs of national construction and people's lives. However, some important engineering construction units have insufficient understanding of the arduousness and complexity of basic construction. In the construction process, they do not follow construction procedures, do not carry out systematic preparation work, and do not pay attention to strengthening construction management, but want to create "miracles" of early handover to production. As a result, "haste makes waste," not only delaying the completion date repeatedly, but also causing great waste. The construction situation of the central shaft newly built by the Northeast Coal Mine Administration of the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry in the Xi'an Coal Mine Area of Liaoyuan City, Jilin Province, is an example.

The Xi'an Coal Mine Area looks like a basin, and several pairs of inclined shafts have been opened along the edge of the basin to mine coal. However, to mine the considerable amount of coal buried deep in the basin, it is necessary to build a vertical shaft in the center of the mining area. In November 1950, the Northeast Coal Mine Administration established a vertical shaft engineering team under the Xi'an Mining Bureau and broke ground. After digging the shaft for several months, they sent the data to the Soviet Union for design assistance. In June 1952, the preliminary design arrived, and then the technical design and construction drawings arrived successively. However, a lot of construction had already been carried out, and a series of waste problems were exposed.

Due to construction without a general construction layout plan, the location of many temporary projects was arranged inappropriately, which not only affected the construction, but also caused waste. For example, the freight yard where the construction unit loaded, unloaded, and stored equipment moved three times due to inappropriate location, wasting more than 10,000 yuan in transportation costs alone. Another example is that the temporary winch room of the auxiliary shaft occupied the permanent air heating room and boiler room, and the temporary winch room of the main shaft occupied the permanent fan room. When the permanent air heating room, boiler room, and permanent fan room were under construction, the temporary winch rooms of the auxiliary shaft and the main shaft had to be moved. This not only increased the cost of demolition, relocation, and construction of temporary projects, but also delayed the hoisting of the underground, affecting the progress of the project. What is worse is that the temporary compressor room occupied the permanent machine repair shop and a section of cables and pipelines, seriously affecting the connection of processes and prolonging the construction period.

In the construction of shafts and underground roadways, due to starting construction before the design was completed, and then correcting after the technical design and construction drawings arrived, it caused a lot of waste. For example, a 33-meter-long roadway originally dug in the west wing of the minus 54 level underground had to be abandoned and rerouted because it did not meet the requirements of the technical design. The original roadway excavation adopted the method of opening small sections multiple times, so that no meter of roadway was finished in a year in 1953; then, the small sections were brushed and enlarged to create roadways, which reduced construction efficiency, increased construction costs, and prolonged the construction period.

The leaders of the Xi'an Coal Mine Central Shaft construction unit and construction unit were overwhelmed by past achievements, underestimated the arduousness and complexity of simultaneously carrying out comprehensive construction in civil construction, tunneling construction, and mechanical and electrical installation in 1954, and had no idea about equipment ordering, or even how much engineering work was left. They proposed a plan to hand over the pair of vertical shafts to production in October 1954. The Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Coal Mine Management Bureau even agreed to hand over the central vertical shaft to production on November 7, 1954. However, in the progress plan they arranged, many important projects that must be completed were omitted. They did not even think about the geological problems that might occur.

After mechanical and electrical installation, tunneling construction, and civil construction were carried out simultaneously, there were many problems to be solved. However, the leading staff of the construction unit "divided their forces and did their own things"; some leading staff members also developed arrogance and complacency due to past achievements, did not seriously implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, refused to listen to the opinions of employees, and believed that the instructions of the superior leading organs were not practical, but self-righteously desperately pursued progress, and desperately wanted to create a "miracle" of early handover to production.

However, throughout 1954, the progress plan of the project was not completed every month, especially since the equipment did not arrive at the construction site on schedule, and the installation plan was far behind (the shaft installation plan was originally scheduled to be completed in August 1954, but it was not completed until June 1955). In addition, the problems of encountering faults and the need to increase a large number of roadways underground, their plan to hand over to production in October last year was overturned. Later, after the superior leading organs sent people to inspect and rectify, they had to decide to postpone the handover to production. It was originally planned to postpone it to May of this year, and then changed to July and October. Recently, after carefully arranging the engineering projects, existing forces, equipment arrival, and production preparations, it was decided to strive for formal handover to production in the winter of this year.

The plan to hand over the central shaft to production in October last year, and the various erroneous measures taken by the construction unit and the construction unit that followed it, caused great losses to the state. For example, the construction unit had no idea about the arrival of foreign equipment, but in order to reluctantly meet the need to hand over the vertical shaft to production earlier, it purchased and ordered a large number of substitute equipment domestically. Some substitute equipment was purchased, but foreign equipment also arrived; some foreign equipment arrived long ago, but was placed in the warehouse, but then went to purchase or order substitute equipment; some substitute equipment was unusable because it did not meet the standards. As a result, a lot of substitute equipment was backlogged. Although these backlogged substitute equipment were processed successively, nearly one million yuan of funds were still backlogged by the end of 1954, and more than 300,000 yuan of funds were still backlogged by the end of May this year. For some domestic orders, the construction unit violated the contract and simply did not want them, and the losses suffered by brother factories and mines are not included. By the end of 1954, the materials backlogged by the construction unit due to the incomplete progress plan and blind material preparation were worth 479,000 yuan according to the records. In 1954, the engineering cost exceeded the budget by 814,300 yuan, of which the overspending of basic wages accounted for 75.53% of the total overspending. The reason why the basic wages overspent so much was due to the large increase in workers to rush the work, the labor force was poorly organized, the labor efficiency was very low, the machinery utilization rate was also very low, the stoppage and idling of work were serious, the technicians did miscellaneous work and took technician wages, and the engineering quality was not good, resulting in serious rework. It can be seen how serious the "at any cost" situation in this engineering construction was. In 1954, many personal accidents of varying degrees occurred on the construction site. These are the consequences of being eager for success, blindly pursuing early handover to production, and not taking the necessary technical, organizational, and safety measures.

The construction site failed to complete the plan every month last year, and from January to May this year, it still failed to complete the plan every month. In addition to the fact that the work plan compiled by the construction unit was not in line with the actual situation, and the plan was not based on advanced and reliable foundations, lacking realism and guidance, one of the main reasons was that they blindly caught up with the progress, but did not strengthen the technical leadership work, and neglected the construction preparation work for each project during the construction process.

Taking the cage installation project of the auxiliary shaft in May this year as an example, this project is the key to the hoisting of the auxiliary shaft and is something that the majority of employees are looking forward to completing quickly. Because the cage of the auxiliary shaft was not installed properly, personnel working underground had to go down from the inclined shaft—the second pit of the Fuguo Coal Mine—which was quite far from the vertical shaft, and had to walk 4,500 to 5,000 meters underground to reach the work site. This not only affected the improvement of underground work efficiency, but also affected the supply of materials needed underground and the hoisting of gangue, which also affected the progress of the entire project. Soviet experts repeatedly made suggestions requesting the quick installation of the cage of the auxiliary shaft. Although the installation work area started the construction preparation work for installing the cage in March, it did not organize the installation workers to seriously study the drawings. The leaders of the work area did not clearly tell everyone the Soviet experts' suggestions on installing the cage. It was not accurately calculated how much technical force was needed for this installation project. Just because it was a "key of the key," dozens of technicians were transferred from the other six projects to support it. During the installation of the cage, the technicians who directed the brake steel cable did not follow the experts' suggestions, and a major accident occurred. Because enough winch drivers who could master the cage hoisting were not trained in advance, during the cage installation process, a technically skilled winch driver had to work continuously for seven days and seven nights, and some fitters also worked continuously for three days and three nights. However, the large number of technical workers who came to support could hardly get involved, and many people had to find some odd jobs to do. The cage of the auxiliary shaft, which was originally scheduled to be installed by May 15, was not installed until the end of May. However, because the winch drivers were not enough and some other problems were not solved, the cage of the auxiliary shaft could not be put into operation immediately.

Like the above-mentioned negligence of technical leadership work, construction without sufficient preparation, resulting in rework or idling, happened in almost every major installation project. The drawings and specifications stipulated that concrete must be poured on the base before installing the body of the compressor. However, because the installation workers did not study the drawings and specifications at all, and did not pour concrete on the base, they "installed" the compressor. After the Soviet experts inspected and found that it did not meet the standards, they had to rework it all, thus delaying the construction period by more than ten days. When installing the compressor bearing, it was necessary to use a large straight ruler to level it, but the construction site was not prepared in advance. When it was needed, they sent someone to borrow it from another place, which delayed the construction period by more than twenty days.

In tunneling construction and civil construction, due to the weakness of technical leadership work and the lack of systematic construction preparation work, the roadways were not dug straight, the waistlines and centerlines were misplaced, the arch walls were uneven, there were many honeycomb surfaces, pitting, and cracks, and the newly built factories and buildings leaked rain, and so on, rework accidents occurred constantly.

The construction unit and the construction unit of the Xi'an Coal Mine Central Shaft need to conscientiously implement the spirit of strictly practicing comprehensive economy and overcoming all waste. While stepping up efforts and striving to put this pair of vertical shafts into production this winter, they should seriously examine the mistakes and shortcomings in the construction process of this pair of vertical shafts, summarize the experiences and lessons, so as to improve future work.

    不按建设程序办事的教训
    朱力
    在工业基本建设中，在根据经济原则和可能的条件下，尽量加快建设速度对国民经济的发展是有重大意义的。因为建设速度的加快，不仅能使固定资产提前动用以增加生产能力，而且能使国家投资周转加快，避免把有用资金长期地积压在不能投入生产的工程上。同时，加快工程的建设速度还可以相对地节省很多开支。目前，我国煤炭的生产还远远赶不上需要的增长，因此，对于先行工业的煤矿建设来说，更有必要采取一切可能的但必须是根据经济原则的措施来加快建设速度，以满足国家建设和人民生活的需要。但是，有些重要的工程建设单位对基本建设的艰巨性复杂性认识不足，在建设过程中不按建设程序办事，不进行有系统的准备工作，不注意加强施工管理，却想要创造提早移交生产的“奇迹”，结果是“欲速则不达”，不仅完工日期一再拖延，而且造成很大的浪费。燃料工业部煤矿管理总局东北煤矿管理局在吉林省辽源市西安煤矿区新建的中央竖井的建设情形便是一个例子。
    西安煤矿区好像一个盆地，盆地边沿上早就开有几对斜井采煤。但要把盆地深部的埋藏量相当大的煤采出来，就需要在矿区中央建设竖井。一九五○年十一月，东北煤矿管理局在西安矿务局下面成立了一个竖井工程队，就破土开工了。掘了好几个月井筒，他们才把资料送请苏联帮助设计。一九五二年六月，初步设计才来，随后技术设计和施工图纸才陆续来到，但施工已进行了不少，一系列的浪费问题就暴露出来了。
    由于没有施工总平面布置图就施工，许多临时工程的位置安排得很不适当，不仅施工受到影响，并且造成浪费。例如建设单位在工地装卸和存放设备的货场，因位置放得不适当而搬了三次家，光搬运费就浪费了一万多元。又如副井的临时绞车房占用了永久空气加热室和锅炉房的位置，主井的临时绞车房占用了永久扇风机房的位置，到永久空气加热室、锅炉房和永久扇风机房施工时，副井和主井的临时绞车房也只好搬家。这不仅增加了临时工程的拆除、搬迁和修建费用，而且耽误了井下的提升，影响了工程的进度。更糟的是临时压风机房占用了永久机修库和一段电缆、管道的位置，严重地影响了工序的衔接，并且延长了工期。
    在井筒和井下巷道施工中，由于开工在前，设计在后，等技术设计和施工图纸来后再更正，这就造成了很大的浪费。例如井下负五四水平西翼原来掘成的一条三十三公尺长的巷道，因为不合技术设计的要求，便只好作废而另行改道。原来巷道掘进采取先开凿小断面的多次成巷办法，使得一九五三年掘了一年，却没有一公尺巷道是成品；后来再把小断面刷大作成巷道，这就减低了施工效率，加大了施工费用，还延长了工期。
    西安煤矿中央竖井建设单位和施工单位的领导同志们被过去一些成就冲昏了头脑，对一九五四年要在土木建筑、井巷建设、机电安装等三方面同时全面施工的艰巨性和复杂性估计不足，对设备订货情况心中无数，甚至对究竟还有多少工程量也没有弄清楚，就提出要在一九五四年十月把这对竖井移交生产的计划。而燃料工业部和煤矿管理总局竟然同意他们在一九五四年十一月七日把中央竖井移交生产。可是，在他们安排的进度计划中，把不少必须完成的重要项目都漏掉了。对地质方面可能发生的问题更没有想到。
    机电安装、井巷建设和土木建筑同时进行施工以后，需要解决的问题很多。但施工单位的领导工作人员们，却“分兵把口，各行其是”；有的领导工作人员还因为过去所取得的成就而滋长了骄傲自满情绪，对苏联专家的建议不认真执行，对职工群众的意见不肯倾听，对上级领导机关的指示也认为不合实际，却自以为是地拚命追求进度，一心想创造提早移交生产的“奇迹”。
    但是，一九五四年全年，工程的进度计划月月都完不成，特别是设备没有按期到达工地，安装计划更是差得很远（井筒安装计划原定一九五四年八月完工，实际上拖到一九五五年六月也没有完成）。加上井下发生的遇到断层和需要大量增加巷道等问题，他们要在去年十月移交生产的计划就被推翻了。后来经过上级领导机关派人检查和整顿，只好决定延期移交生产。原来打算延期到今年五月，后来又改为七月，十月。最近根据工程项目、现有力量、设备到货和生产准备等情况仔细排队，才决定争取在今年冬季正式移交生产。
    这个要在去年十月把中央竖井移交生产的计划，以及随它而来的建设单位和施工单位的种种错误措施，给国家造成的损失是很大的。例如，建设单位对国外设备到货情况心中无数，但为了要勉强凑合使竖井提早移交生产，就在国内采购和订制了大批代用设备。有些代用设备采购来了，但国外设备也到了；有些国外设备早就到了，但被放在仓库里，却又去采购或订制了代用设备；有的代用设备因为不合标准，不能用，于是，许多代用设备就被积压下来了。积压的这些代用设备虽然陆续处理，但到一九五四年年底还积压了近百万元的资金，直到今年五月底也还积压了三十多万元的资金。有些国内订货，建设单位违背合同干脆不要，使兄弟厂矿遭受的损失还不计算在内。到一九五四年底，施工单位因进度计划完不成和盲目备料而积压的材料，有账可查的就值四十七万九千元。一九五四年工程成本超支八十一万四千三百元，其中基本工资超支占超支总额的百分之七十五点五三。基本工资之所以超支这么多，是由于大量增加工人来突击赶工，劳动力组织得不好，劳动效率很低，机械运用率也很低，停工、窝工严重，技工做杂工活拿技工工资，以及工程质量不好，返工严重等原因所造成的。可见这个工程建设中的“不惜工本”的情形是如何严重了。一九五四年工地发生很多大小人身事故。这些，就是急于求成，盲目追求提早移交生产，而不采取应有的技术、组织和安全措施所造成的恶果。
    这个工地去年月月完不成计划，今年一月到五月，也还是月月完不成计划。这除了因为施工单位编制的作业计划不切合实际情况，计划不是建立在先进和可靠的基础之上，缺乏现实性和指导性以外，主要原因之一，是他们一味赶进度，却不加强技术领导工作，并且在施工过程中忽视对每一件工程的施工准备工作所致。
    以今年五月份副井罐笼安装工程为例，这件工程是副井提升的关键，是广大职工都盼望迅速完成的事。因为副井的罐笼没安装好，到井下工作的人员得从距竖井相当远的斜井——富国煤矿二坑下去，要在地下走四千五百到五千公尺，才能到达工作地点。这不仅影响井下工作效率的提高，而且影响井下所需材料的供应和矸石的提升，也就是影响整个工程的进度。苏联专家屡次提出建议，要求迅速把副井罐笼安装好。安装工区虽在三月间就着手进行安装罐笼的施工准备工作，却没有组织安装工人认真学习图纸。苏联专家有关安装罐笼的建议，工区领导工作人员也没有清楚地告诉大家。这件安装工程需要多少技术力量也没有精确计算，只因为它是“重点中的重点”，便从其他六项工程上抽调了数十名技术工人来支援它。在安装罐笼的过程中，指导下制动钢丝绳的技术人员不按专家建议办事，发生了重大事故。由于事前没有训练好足够的能掌握罐笼提升的绞车司机，在罐笼安装过程中，有一个技术较熟练的绞车司机不得不连续工作了七天七夜，有的钳工也连续工作了三天三夜。可是，来支援的大批技术工人简直插不上手，许多人只得找些零活干。原订五月十五日必须安装好的副井罐笼，竟拖到五月底才算安装上了。但因为绞车司机不够和其他一些问题没有解决，副井罐笼还不能立即发挥作用。
    像上述的忽视技术领导工作，不作充分准备就施工，因而造成返工或窝工的事，差不多在每一件较大的安装工程中都发生过。图纸说明书上规定在安装压风机的机身以前，必须在机座上浇灌混凝土。但因安装工人们根本没有学习图纸说明书，没有在机座上浇灌混凝土，就把压风机“安装”上了。经苏联专家检查不合标准，于是又全部返工，因而延误工期十多天。在安装压风机轴承时，需要用大平尺来找平，但工地事先没有准备好，要用时才现派人到外地去借，结果延误工期二十多天。
    在井巷建设和土木建筑当中，由于技术领导工作薄弱和不做系统的施工准备工作，巷道掘的不直，腰线、中线放错，碹墙凸凹不匀，蜂窝、麻面和裂缝很多，新盖的厂房和大楼漏雨等等返工事故不断发生。
    西安煤矿中央竖井的建设单位和施工单位，需要认真贯彻厉行全面节约，克服一切浪费的精神，在加紧努力，争取今年冬季使这对竖井投入生产的同时，严肃地检查这对竖井建设过程中的错误，缺点，总结经验教训，以便改进今后工作。
