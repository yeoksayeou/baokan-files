This newspaper regularly reports on all aspects of China's socialist construction.

Recently, a complete set of new printing equipment donated by the Soviet "Pravda" to the "Russian-language Friendship Newspaper" has been shipped to Beijing. With the improvement of printing conditions, it will be able to meet the needs of more readers.

    俄文友好报受到中苏读者欢迎
    由中苏友好协会总会主办、今年四月十五日在北京创刊的“俄文友好报”，受到中国和苏联读者的欢迎。几个月来，它通过各种形式向苏联人民报道了中国人民在政治、经济、文化建设方面的一些成就，向中国人民介绍了苏联人民在共产主义建设中所取得的一些成绩和经验，同时还广泛地宣传了日益发展着的中苏两国人民的友好关系。
    “俄文友好报”是在苏联专家直接协助下编辑的，并尽量地学习和吸取了苏联工作的先进经验。它经常在第一版轮替地刊载“今日中国”、“在苏联各地”和“在五年计划的工地上”或“新中国日常生活的报道”、“和我们的记者谈话”等专栏，报道在中苏两国伟大建设事业中的新动态和新成就。第二版经常发表“在新中国的地图上”、“新中国的人物”、“中国的历史掌故”等专栏和其他介绍中国各方面重要情况的专题文章和讲演稿，以及中苏两国作者关于阐述两国伟大友谊的文章，同时特别注意发表两国先进工人和工程技术人员间互相交流工作经验的来信。这个报纸曾经几次发表了鞍山钢铁公司和苏联德聂泊捷尔仁斯基钢铁工厂、乌拉尔重型机器工厂等许多著名工矿单位的工人之间的热情的通信，也曾发表了中国国营友谊农场和苏联国营日丹诺夫农场工作人员间的通信。
    这个报纸上经常地报道中国社会主义建设中的各个方面的情况。最近这几天的报纸，用很大篇幅介绍了全国人民代表大会第二次会议的情况，并发表了有关第一个五年计划的重要文献。此外，曾系统地刊载了肃清胡风反革命集团的综合报道和专题文章。不少苏联读者说，这个报纸帮助他们知道了关于中国的许多情况；许多中国读者说，这个报纸经常供应了他们学习苏联的新材料。
      “俄文友好报”创刊初期，销售不足两千份，目前国内外发行总数约一万份，其中对外发行数量已经超过五千份，主要是销行于苏联各地。最近，苏联“真理报”赠送给“俄文友好报”的整套新的印刷设备已经运到北京，印刷条件改善后，它将能满足更多读者的需要。
