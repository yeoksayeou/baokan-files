Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, August 28th: The 44th Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union discussed the issue of peaceful coexistence between countries at its meeting on the 27th.

　　The first item discussed was a draft resolution on the legal and moral principles of coexistence. Henri Rolin, Chairman of the Legal Questions Committee and former President of the Belgian Senate, reported on this issue. He stated that the purpose of reviewing legal issues was to reach an agreement on adhering to the principles of international law and respecting signed treaties, as well as on non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. This issue includes defining the concept of aggression.

　　Rolin pointed out that the international situation had eased to some extent. In the speeches of many representatives at this conference, one could hear tones different from those at the last Vienna conference. We should maintain this tone and maintain the "Geneva spirit" in the future.

　　In the last part of his report, Rolin discussed the issue of admitting the People's Republic of China to the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the United Nations. He said: "I believe that although some people in New York refuse to let China enter the United Nations, they do recognize the need to sit at the same table with Chinese representatives to solve some problems. We, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, advocate using our work to consolidate peace. If we do not admit China, which has the right to attend the conference, into our union, are we acting rationally?"

　　Sudanese representative Magoub spoke about the discrimination suffered by people in some countries and the trampling of their rights. He said that not only should the existing problems between East and West be discussed and resolved, but also the problems related to countries still suffering oppression from colonial powers should be discussed and resolved. Magoub suggested adding a clause to the draft resolution calling for the abandonment of colonialism and racial discrimination.

　　Iraqi representative Hordan criticized the actions of the United States, Britain, and France for violating the basic principles of peaceful coexistence stipulated in the Union's resolutions and other international documents. He said that colonialists say in words that they must guarantee rights and freedoms, but in action, they do not do so. The United States and France refuse to give freedom to the Arabs, thus violating the United Nations Charter. He pointed out that Algeria's subordination to France is unnatural, and Algerian residents are being discriminated against. Hordan originally wanted to talk about the suppression taking place in Algeria, but the chairman of the meeting interrupted him.

　　British representative London, on the one hand, advocated peaceful coexistence, but on the other hand, he tried to prove that it seemed that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the policy of "strength" had eased international tensions.

　　Hungarian representative Molnár, on behalf of the Hungarian delegation, expressed agreement with Rolin's report and draft resolution. He also advocated admitting the People's Republic of China to the Inter-Parliamentary Union.

　　Turkish representative Malte said that peaceful coexistence between the two camps is only possible if they are both sincere. He condemned the use of "Cold War" tactics in international relations.

　　Ceylon representative Kotelawala spoke out against colonial rule policies. He asked, why not respect the principle of sovereignty of many countries? Why does the United States interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries and support the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime? He concluded by saying that the People's Republic of China should be admitted to the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union.

　　Soviet representative K.P. Gorshenin emphasized in his speech that the Soviet state, from the first day of its establishment, believed that countries with different social and economic systems could coexist and cooperate peacefully. He said that the Soviet Union's desire for peaceful coexistence was reflected both in formal statements and in the speeches of Soviet state leaders, as well as in the entire foreign policy pursued by the Soviet Union. The Soviet representative stated:

　　1. In our current era, countries with various different social and economic systems can and must coexist based on the basic principles of international law such as "mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence."

　　2. The principles of peaceful coexistence as manifested in international law are also in line with the wishes of all people who desire peace and friendship between all countries.

　　3. The Soviet Union has always and continues to uphold the principles of peaceful coexistence.

　　4. The most important task of national parliaments and the Inter-Parliamentary Union is to use everything they can to promote the principles of peaceful coexistence as the basis for relations between countries and peoples. Broadly absorbing parliamentary representatives of countries that contribute to consolidating world peace (including the People's Republic of China) into the Inter-Parliamentary Union will certainly help to accomplish the above-mentioned tasks.

　　Gorshenin said that the Soviet delegation supports the draft resolution on the legal and moral principles of coexistence submitted to the conference for discussion, but believes that it is necessary to add a point in the preamble, pointing out that the conference satisfactorily affirms the easing of international tensions due to the steps taken by governments in recent times, especially due to the Four-Power Summit held in Geneva.

　　Representatives from Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Lebanon, the Federal Republic of Germany, Finland, Thailand, India, Italy, Syria and other countries also spoke at the meeting.

　　Rolin, who reported on this issue, spoke last, and after his speech, the discussion on the issue of international security and disarmament began. The report on this issue was made by Mr. Amon of France.

　　各国议会联盟大会会议讨论和平共处问题
　　比、匈、锡兰等国代表主张邀我代表团参加
    新华社二十八日讯　据塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：各国议会联盟第四十四届大会二十七日会议讨论了各国和平共处的问题。
    首先讨论的是关于共处的法律和道义原则的决议草案。法律问题委员会主席、比利时上议院前议长安里·罗兰就这个问题作了报告。他说，审查法律问题的目的是：就遵守国际法原则和遵守签订的条约以及就不干涉别国内政取得协议。这个问题包括确定侵略的概念。
    罗兰指出，国际局势已经有了某种程度的缓和。在许多代表在这次大会的发言中都可以听到不同于上次维也纳大会上的声调。我们今后应当保持这种声调，保持“日内瓦精神”。
    罗兰在报告的最后部分谈到了关于接纳中华人民共和国加入各国议会联盟和进入联合国的问题。他说：“我认为，虽然在纽约有些人拒绝让中国进入联合国，但是毕竟承认有必要同中国代表坐在一张桌子旁边来解决一些问题。我们，各国议会联盟，主张用我们的工作来巩固和平。如果我们不接纳有权出席大会的中国加入我们的联盟，那么我们是否在按照理智行事呢？”
    苏丹代表马古布在发言中谈到了一些国家的人民受到歧视和他们的权利遭到蹂躏的情况。他说，不但应该讨论和解决东西方之间现有的问题，而且应该讨论和解决有关至今还遭受殖民国家压迫的国家的问题。马古布建议在决议草案中加入一条要求放弃殖民主义和种族歧视的条款。
    伊拉克代表霍尔丹批评了美国、英国和法国违背联盟决议和其他国际文件规定的和平共处的基本原则的行动。他说，殖民主义者口头说必须保障权利和自由，而在行动中他们却不这么做。美国和法国拒绝给阿拉伯人自由，因而违背了联合国宪章。他指出，阿尔及利亚从属于法国是不自然的，阿尔及利亚居民正在受到歧视待遇。霍尔丹本来想谈一谈正在阿尔及利亚发生的镇压行动，但是会议主席打断了他的话。
    英国代表朗敦一方面主张和平共处，但是另一方面又力图证明，似乎是北大西洋公约组织和“实力地位”政策使得国际紧张局势缓和。
    匈牙利代表莫尔纳尔代表匈牙利代表团表示同意罗兰的报告和决议草案。他同时主张接纳中华人民共和国加入各国议会联盟。
    土耳其代表马尔特说，只有彼此都具有诚意，两个阵营的和平共处才有可能。他谴责在国际关系中使用“冷战”手段。
    锡兰代表科特拉瓦拉在发言中反对殖民统治政策。他发问道，为什么不尊重许多国家的主权原则？为什么美国干涉亚洲国家的内政和支持蒋介石傀儡政权？他最后说，应该让中华人民共和国进入联合国和各国议会联盟。
    苏联代表康·彼·戈尔谢宁在发言中着重指出，苏维埃国家从它成立的第一天起就认为具有不同社会和经济制度的国家是可以和平共处和合作的。他说，苏联希望和平共处的意志无论是在正式的声明中和苏维埃国家领导人的言论中，或者是在苏联执行的整个外交政策方针中都反映了出来。苏联代表声明：
    一、在我们当前的时代，具有各种不同的社会和经济制度的国家能够而且必须根据“互相尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处”这样一些国际法的基本原则实行共处。
    二、表现在国际法上的和平共处的原则也是符合希望和平和各国人民友好的各国人民的愿望的。
    三、苏联过去和现在始终维护和平共处的原则。
    四、各国议会和各国议会联盟的最重要的任务就是用它们所能办到的一切办法来促使各国和平共处的原则成为各个国家和各国人民相互关系的基础。广泛地吸收对巩固世界和平作出贡献的国家
  （包括中华人民共和国）的议会代表加入各国议会联盟，对完成上述任务一定有所帮助。
    戈尔谢宁说，苏联代表团支持提交大会讨论的关于共处的法律和道义原则的决议草案，然而认为必须在序言中补充一点，指出大会满意地肯定由于各国政府在最近时期所采取的一些步骤、特别是由于在日内瓦举行了四国政府首脑会议而取得的国际紧张局势的缓和。
    在会上发言的还有捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫、黎巴嫩、德意志联邦共和国、芬兰、泰国、印度、意大利、叙利亚等国的代表。
    就这一问题作报告的罗兰最后讲了话，在他讲话之后开始讨论关于国际安全和裁军情况的问题。就这一问题做报告的是法国的阿蒙。
