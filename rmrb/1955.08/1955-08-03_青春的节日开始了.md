    The Festival of Youth Begins
    By Our Correspondent Feng Zhidan
    July 31st, as the morning glow slowly rose over the Vistula River, and families on both banks awakened from their sleep, Warsaw immediately burst into activity. Warsaw residents put on their new festival clothes. Whether it was the girl Marusha, the boy Janusz, or their grandmother, they all rushed to the streets leading to Stalin Square. They were waiting to welcome the youth delegations of various skin colors from every corner of the earth. At noon, the Soviet delegation, the Chinese delegation, and other national delegations marched in formation towards Stalin Square, and then the youth delegations of various countries proceeded along Jerusalem Avenue towards the "Tenth Anniversary Stadium." Warsaw residents lined the streets in dense layers, waving to welcome the youth delegations. A young mother even held her newborn baby and threw flowers to the messengers of youth and peace. From the hundreds of windows of the newly built six-story Central Department Store, an immeasurable number of smiling faces peered out, extending an immeasurable number of hands of friendship. However, the crumbling walls riddled with bullet holes of the building diagonally opposite the department store seemed to be accusing the fascist bandits of their crimes to the youth of the world, calling on the youth of the world to unite to defend peace and oppose new wars.
    At about four o'clock, the youth delegations marched to the east gate of the stadium. Passing through an entrance built like a cave was the stadium. The stands, shaped like slopes on all sides, surrounded the green grass, and the word "Peace" was engraved on the stone walls of the stands in various languages. The youth delegations of the world, in the order of the first letter of the country names in Polish, entered the gate of peace, led by a guard of honor composed of Polish athletes carrying the huge emblem of the World Federation of Democratic Youth.
    At exactly four o'clock, bugles sounded, and Polish state leaders Bolesław Bierut, Aleksander Zawadzki, Józef Cyrankiewicz, and Konstanty Rokossowski, among others, ascended the rostrum to take their seats. World Federation of Democratic Youth leaders Bernini, Jacques Denis, and Danes, among others, walked onto the rostrum. The Fifth World Festival of Youth and Students opened amidst thunderous applause.
    After speeches by Bernini, Chairman of the International Festival Committee, and Cyrankiewicz, Chairman of the Polish Council of Ministers, thousands of peace doves flew up from all directions of the stands, soaring in flocks over Warsaw.
    The delegations marched around the stadium. Today, marching here are about 30,000 youth representatives from 108 countries, and the number of countries participating in the festival will reach 114. This is an unprecedentedly grand procession for peace and friendship. Countries such as Japan and Indonesia, which had only a small delegation at previous festivals, sent a delegation of considerable size today. Youth from places like Nyasaland and Senegal are participating in the festival for the first time. Figures from a week ago indicated that more than 300 member organizations of the World Federation of Democratic Youth participated in this festival. Including youth from all parts of Poland and Warsaw, about 100,000 people participated in the opening ceremony of the festival.
    Look, youth delegations with extremely broad representation from different countries, different skin colors, different political and religious beliefs, and different occupations passed the rostrum. We saw the black youth representatives from the African continent, who are fighting for the independence of their nations, marching with their heads held high; we saw the joyous youth delegations from the people's democratic countries marching; we saw the American youth delegation marching, they only numbered twenty-six due to passport difficulties; we saw the youth delegation from Costa Rica marching, they were only two people, but people enthusiastically cheered them, expressing sympathy and support for their people's anti-colonial struggle. ...
    The appearance of the Chinese youth delegation aroused enthusiastic applause from the entire venue. The procession included youth representatives from thirteen ethnic groups wearing different costumes. Dragon lanterns were danced in the procession. As the colorful Chinese youth delegation marched, people in the stands stood up, cheered the Chinese youth, and threw countless flowers.
    When the great and glorious Soviet youth delegation appeared in front of the rostrum, the mood in the venue reached a climax. The road in front of them was blocked by crowds, and the most moving scene unfolded in front of the rostrum. Youth from many countries, including the United States, Bulgaria, Sudan, China... surged forward to hug the Soviet youth. An American youth named George, carrying the American flag, ran to the Soviet youth and hugged and kissed them. Sudanese youth Sudeiman excitedly shouted "Soviet Union!" "Soviet Union!", threw himself forward, and hugged a Soviet youth tightly. The entire venue resounded with cheers of "Long live the Soviet Union!"
    The hosts of the festival, the glorious Polish youth delegation, came last. They marched holding high the red and white flowers symbolizing their national flag. Delegations from various countries enthusiastically cheered the Polish youth.
    At 6:30 in the afternoon, the parade ended, salutes were fired, and parachutes blossomed in the sky, fluttering the national flags of various countries. People paid their respects to every flag. Suddenly, a glider soared across the sky, and ten gliders circled in the air. The dance performance of more than 400 Polish youths began. The beautiful steps of the polonaise and mazurka, and the moving music of Moniuszko touched the hearts of every foreign youth. Dear Poland, how joyful you sing today, how beautifully you dance! The festival of youth has begun.

    青春的节日开始了
    本报记者　冯之丹
    七月三十一日，当朝霞在维斯杜拉河上徐徐升起，两岸的家庭从睡乡里苏醒过来时，华沙立即沸腾起来了。华沙居民都穿上了节日的新装。不论是女孩子玛露霞和男孩子杨努士或是他们的老祖母都赶到通向斯大林广场的各条大街。他们等待着欢迎来自地球各个角落的各种肤色的青年队伍。中午，苏联代表团、中国代表团和其它各国代表团整队向斯大林广场集中，然后各国青年队伍沿着耶路撒冷大街向“十周年运动场”行进。华沙居民在大街两旁密密层层地排列着，向青年队伍招手欢迎，一个年青的妈妈还抱着初生的婴儿，把鲜花投给青年的和平使者。战后新建的六层楼中央百货大厦的数百个窗户上，探出彷佛数不清的欢笑的脸来，伸出数不清的友谊的手来；但是大厦斜对面弹痕累累的楼房的颓壁残瓦，似乎是在向全世界青年控诉法西斯匪徒的罪行，呼吁全世界青年团结起来为保卫和平、反对新战争而斗争。
    四时许，青春的队伍行进至运动场的东门。穿过一个建得像一座山洞一样的入口，就是运动场。四面坡形的看台环绕着绿色的草地，看台石壁上刻着各种文字的“和平”字样。全世界的青年队伍，按波文为首字母的次序，以抬着世界民主青年联盟的巨大盟徽的波兰运动员组成的仪仗队为前导，进入和平大门。
    正四时，号角吹起，波兰的国家领导人贝鲁特、萨瓦茨基、西伦凯维兹和罗科索夫斯基等登上主席台就座，世界民主青年联盟领导人柏尼尼、雅克·德尼及但尼斯等走上主席台，第五届国际青年与学生联欢节在雷动的掌声中开幕了。
    在联欢节国际委员会主席柏尼尼和波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹致辞之后，成千只和平鸽从看台的四面八方飞起，成群地翱翔在华沙的上空。
    队伍环绕运动场行进。今天在这里行进着的是来自一百零八个国家的约三万个青年代表，而参加联欢节的国家将要达到一一四个。这是空前壮阔的争取和平和友谊的队伍。日本、印度尼西亚等国，在历届联欢节上只有一个很小的代表团，而今天派来了一个有相当人数的代表团。尼亚萨兰、塞内加尔等地的青年还是第一次参加联欢节。一个星期以前的数字指明，三百个以上的世界民主青年联盟的会员组织参加了这次联欢节。包括波兰各地和华沙来的青年在内，参加联欢节开幕式的约有十万人。
    你看，不同国家、不同肤色、不同政治和宗教信仰、不同职业的代表性极为广泛的青年队伍通过了主席台。我们看到来自非洲大陆的、正在为自己民族的独立而斗争的黑色青年代表们昂首行进；看到人民民主国家的欢乐的青年队伍在行进；看到美国青年代表在行进，由于护照的困难，他们只有二十六人；看到哥斯达黎加的青年代表在行进，他们是两个人，但是人们对他们热烈地欢呼，表示对他们人民的反殖民主义斗争的同情和支持。……
    中国的青年队伍的出现引起满场热烈的掌声。行列中包括了穿着不同服装的十三个民族的青年代表。队伍中舞起龙灯来了。当多彩的中国青年的队伍行进时，看台上的人们站立起来向中国青年欢呼并投掷了数不清的鲜花。
    当伟大的光荣的苏联青年的队伍出现在主席台前时，场内的情绪发展到了高潮。他们面前的路都被人群堵塞了，主席台前展现了最动人的景象。美、保、苏丹、中国……好多国家的青年都涌过去和苏联青年拥抱。美国青年乔治扛着美国国旗奔向苏联青年拥抱亲吻。苏丹青年苏底曼激动地叫唤着“苏联”“苏联”，身子向前扑去，和一个苏联青年紧紧地抱在一起了。全场响彻着“苏联万岁”的欢呼声。
    联欢节的主人、光荣的波兰青年队伍最后走来了。他们高举着象征他们国旗的红白花朵行进。各国代表团都向波兰青年热情地欢呼。
    下午六时半，游行结束，礼炮齐鸣，朵朵降落伞在空中散开，飘起了世界各国的国旗，人们向每一面国旗致敬。突然，一架滑翔机掠过天空，十架滑翔机在空中盘旋，四百多名波兰青年的舞蹈表演开始，波罗尼兹和玛佐夫卡的美妙的舞步，莫纽斯基动人的音乐打动着每一个外国青年的心灵。亲爱的波兰啊，今天你是唱得多么地欢，你是跳得多么地美啊。青春的节日开始了。
