The China Railway Locomotive Sports Association held the "1955 National Railway Correspondence Sports Meet" from early May to mid-August.

This conference was conducted in a correspondence format, learning from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union. Participating in the conference were 30 units under the Ministry of Railways, including various railway administrations, engineering bureaus, engineering companies, design sub-bureaus, and directly subordinate organizations of the Ministry of Railways, with a total of more than 7,400 male and female athletes. After these units held their sports meets, they reported the athletes' results to the chief referee of the conference—the China Railway Locomotive Sports Association—via correspondence. The chief referee then selected the best-performing athletes in the railway system nationwide to form track and field, cycling, and weightlifting teams in preparation for participating in the First National Workers' Sports Meet.

The Harbin Railway Administration won the first place in total scores for both men's and women's track and field and cycling competitions in this conference. On August 9th, female athlete Shen Bingqing from this unit broke the national record of 10 minutes 48.4 seconds in the 5,000-meter cycling competition with a time of 10 minutes 34.6 seconds. In the 3,000-meter cycling competition, Shen Bingqing's time also reached 6 minutes 20 seconds, approaching the national record of 6 minutes 18 seconds. In the men's and women's track and field and cycling competitions, the scores of six items and 92 people and nine items and 39 people respectively broke the highest records of the national railway system.

While holding the correspondence sports meet, the China Railway Locomotive Sports Association also organized five working groups to tour various units, selecting male and female ball game athletes to participate in the First National Workers' Sports Meet.

According to statistics, before this conference, more than 140,000 employees in the railway system participated in grassroots sports meets.

　  全国铁路通讯运动大会结束
    中国火车头体育协会从五月上旬到八月中旬举办了“一九五五年全国铁路通讯运动大会”。
    这次大会是学习苏联先进经验，采取通讯的方式进行的。参加大会的有铁道部所属的各铁路管理局、工程局、工程公司、设计分局和铁道部直属机关等三十个单位共有男、女运动员七千四百多人。这些单位举行运动会后，就用通讯的方式把运动员的成绩汇报到这次大会的总裁判处——中国火车头体育协会，再由总裁判处评选出铁路系统全国成绩最好的运动员，组成田径、自行车和举重代表队，准备参加全国第一届工人体育运动大会。
    这次大会的男女田径、自行车比赛的总分第一名都由哈尔滨铁路管理局获得。八月九日，这个单位的女运动员沈冰清在五千公尺自行车比赛中，曾以十分三十四秒六的成绩打破了十分四十八秒四的全国最高纪录。在三千公尺自行车比赛中，沈冰清的成绩也达到了六分二十秒，接近了六分十八秒的全国最高纪录。在男女田径和自行车比赛中，还分别有六项九十二人和九项三十九人的成绩打破了全国铁路系统的最高纪录。
    在举行通讯运动大会的同时，中国火车头体育协会还组织了五个工作组巡回到各单位，选拔了参加全国第一届工人体育运动大会的男女球类运动员。
    据统计，在这次大会前，铁路系统约有十四万多名职工参加了基层运动会。
