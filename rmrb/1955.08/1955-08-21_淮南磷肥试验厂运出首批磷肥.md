The state-owned Huainan Phosphate Fertilizer Experimental Plant in Anhui Province has produced a large quantity of phosphate fertilizer since it officially started production on June 1st. On August 10th and 11th, the Anhui Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative used ships and trains to transport the first batch of more than 300 tons of phosphate fertilizer produced by the plant to various parts of the province for agricultural production cooperatives and others to use as autumn fertilizer. The 1,200 tons of phosphate fertilizer ordered from this plant by the Anhui Provincial Department of Agriculture will also be shipped to various parts of the province for use by farms.

The phosphate fertilizer produced by the Huainan Phosphate Fertilizer Experimental Plant has a phosphorus content of 21 to 23 percent and is of good quality. According to the plant director's experiment, tomato plants without phosphate fertilizer produced only six tomatoes each, while two plants with phosphate fertilizer produced a total of thirty-six tomatoes. The phosphate mine reserves within Fengtai County, Anhui Province, are quite abundant. This phosphate fertilizer experimental plant will train personnel and accumulate experience for the phosphate fertilizer plant under construction, and can also promote a batch of phosphate fertilizer in advance.

　　淮南磷肥试验厂运出首批磷肥
    安徽省地方国营淮南磷肥试验厂从六月一日正式投入生产以来，已经生产了大批磷肥。八月十日、十一日两天，安徽省供销合作社用船和火车把这个厂生产的首批三百多吨磷肥运往省内各地，供农业生产合作社等秋季施肥。安徽省农业厅向这个厂订购的一千二百吨磷肥，也将先后运往省内各地供农场使用。
    淮南磷肥试验厂生产的磷肥，含磷量达百分之二十一到二十三，质量良好。据这个厂的厂长试验，没有施磷肥的番茄，一棵只结六只，施磷肥的两棵，共结番茄三十六只。安徽省凤台县境内磷矿蕴藏量相当丰富。这个磷肥试验厂将为正在建设的磷肥厂培养人材和积累经验，并可先推广一批磷肥。
