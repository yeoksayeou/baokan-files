Evidence of Guilt Cannot Be Destroyed
—The Investigation of a Counter-Revolutionary Murder Case in the Suburbs of Shenyang
Xinhua News Agency Reporter Shen Junhai

On the morning of March 1st, the telephone in the Criminal Police Team office of the Shenyang Public Security Bureau rang. Deputy Captain Yu Hongxu answered the phone and quickly led a special investigation task force of more than ten detectives to depart.

The medium-sized jeep carrying the detectives sped along the winding road, quickly traversing the fields and arriving at the scene of the incident, Dayushu Fort Village, more than forty li west of Shenyang City.

The incident occurred on the night of February 28th: Li Jingyun, the financial commissioner of the Dayu Agricultural Production Cooperative, and all eight members of his family were burned to death. Li Jingyun, who had returned home not long after attending a meeting of cooperative members, was also burned to death in the house.

“Was it murder? Or suicide? Was it arson by bad elements? Or a natural fire?” Deputy Captain Yu Hongxu said to the detectives, “This is our first task in the investigation.”

The detectives examined the eight corpses and found no sharp-edged weapon wounds. The corpses were then sent to the forensic doctor for autopsy. During the autopsy of Li Jingyun’s wife, Xia Yazhen, the forensic doctor found dust and smoke marks in her trachea, initially determining the cause of death as gas poisoning.

In order to find the cause of the fire, the detectives rebuilt the burned wooden structure of the house and carefully observed the scene. They discovered that the fire was very severe in the southeastern corner of the east room, where no cooking was ever done; while the fire was lighter in the west room, where cooking was done. Some of the coal piled up in the room had burned, but most of it was still piled up nicely. Connecting these facts, and based on the northwest wind direction at the time of the fire, most of the detectives believed that the fire had started simultaneously in both the east and west rooms, proving that it was arson by bad elements, rather than a natural fire or gas poisoning.

But to reach a final conclusion on whether it was “gas poisoning” or “arson by bad elements,” the detectives decided to conduct in-depth interviews with the farmers.

Three days after the incident, the detectives discovered a clue during the interviews: The farmers said that the rich peasant Xing Dechang had spread rumors after the incident that Li Jingyun had argued with his father and wife after returning home from the meeting. The detectives seized this clue and conducted further investigation.

Youth League Branch Secretary Liu Zhenwei told the detectives, “When the farmers were actively fighting the fire, I noticed Xing Dechang holding bean stalks and placing them next to his chimney. There was no reason for him to do this, as it would only lead the fire to his house.” The detectives immediately observed Xing Dechang’s chimney and found blood spots on it, with more blood spots closer to the ground. When they removed the bean stalks, they found a brick with blood and women's hair next to a pile of purple blood stains. The detectives photographed this evidence and then arranged it as it was.

At the same time, the forensic doctor's final autopsy results on the eight corpses overturned the "gas poisoning" assessment, proving that the heads of the eight people had been fractured due to blunt force trauma. At this point, it was confirmed that this was a homicide case intended to cover up the crime by destroying the evidence.

Who was the murderer? Why did they cruelly kill all eight members of the family? This was the second task that the detectives needed to investigate.

Just as the detectives were planning to conduct an in-depth investigation to identify the case, the farmers reported that the murder scene had been destroyed. After a thorough investigation by the detectives, Xing Dechang, who had destroyed the murder scene, was arrested and interrogated according to law, and the truth of the case was revealed.

The case was as follows: The reactionary rich peasant element Xing Dechang had some surplus land confiscated during the land reform period. Later, this land was distributed to the poor peasant Li Jingyun. At that time, Xing Dechang was very dissatisfied with the government. After Li Jingyun joined the agricultural production cooperative, his life became richer and richer, and he built a new house on the land originally belonging to Xing Dechang. Xing Dechang became even more hateful when he saw this new house, and he attempted to kill Li Jingyun's entire family and set fire to his house.

In 1954, the counter-revolutionary element Xing Dechang actively wooed Zhao Jinggui, who had infiltrated the cooperative and stolen the position of planning committee member by using double-dealing tactics. Zhao Jinggui was a remnant counter-revolutionary element, and he fully supported Xing Dechang's criminal activities. He also brought the reactionary rich peasant element Xing Degui together, planning to take the opportunity to harm and sabotage Li Jingyun and the cooperative.

On the night of February 28th of this year, the three of them took advantage of Li Jingyun's attendance at a cooperative member meeting to lure Li Jingyun's wife, Xia Yazhen, out. The three of them raped Xia Yazhen in turn, and then brutally smashed her to death with a brick next to Xing Dechang's chimney. Then they jumped into the house and beat to death Li Jingyun's parents, niece, son, and two daughters who were already asleep with wooden sticks. Finally, they carried Xia Yazhen's body into the house and threw it on the kang (heated brick bed). When Li Jingyun returned home late at night after the meeting and just walked into the house, the hidden murderers struck him head-on, and killed Li Jingyun as well. The counter-revolutionary elements attempted to escape punishment for their crimes, and finally set fire to the house in an attempt to destroy the bodies and eliminate the evidence.

This case has recently been investigated by the local public security organs, and the state will soon impose severe punishment on these vicious counter-revolutionary elements.

This brutal counter-revolutionary murder case has aroused great hatred among the local people. They have demanded that these heinous counter-revolutionary murderers be severely punished, and are determined to raise their vigilance, keep their eyes open, and thoroughly eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements.

    罪证是毁灭不了的
    ——记沈阳市郊一个反革命凶杀案件的破获经过
    新华社记者　沈俊海
    三月一日早晨，沈阳市公安局刑警队办公室里的电话铃响着，副队长于洪绪接了电话以后，迅速地率领专案侦察突击组十多名侦察员出发了。
    中型吉普车载着侦察员沿着弯曲的小路，飞快地穿过田垅，到达了沈阳市以西四十多华里的出事地点——大榆树堡村。
    事情发生在二月二十八日深夜：大榆农业生产合作社财务委员李景云全家八口人全部被火烧死，开完社员大会回家不久的李景云也被烧死在屋里。
      “是被杀？还是自杀？是坏人纵火？还是自然起火？”副队长于洪绪向侦察员们说：“这是我们第一步的侦察任务。”
    侦察员们对八具尸体进行了检查，没有发现锐器伤痕。随即将尸体送到法医那里解剖去了。法医解剖李景云妻子夏雅珍的气管时，发现有灰尘和烟薰痕迹，初步鉴定为煤气中毒。
    侦察员们为了找出火灾原因，曾把烧毁的房木架起，对现场进行了仔细观察。发现在从来不烧饭的东屋南隅，火势非常严重；而烧饭的西屋，火势较轻。屋里堆着的煤燃烧了一些，但大部分还很好的堆着。把这些事实联系起来，根据起火时的西北风向，大多数侦察员认为：火势是从东、西屋两处同时发生的，这证明是坏分子放火，而不是自然起火或煤气中毒。
    但究竟是“煤气中毒”还是“坏人纵火”，为了作出最后的结论，侦察员们决定向农民进行深入访问。
    案件发生后第三天，侦察员在访问中发现一个线索：农民们说，富农邢德昌在事情发生后曾传说，李景云开会回家后和他父亲、妻子吵过嘴。侦察员抓住这个线索进一步侦察。
    青年团支部书记刘振维向侦察员说：“农民都积极救火的时候，我发现邢德昌抱着豆秸向他家的烟囱旁边放。他这样做是没有道理的，这样只会把火引到他家去。”侦察员马上观察了邢德昌家的烟囱，发现上面有血点，越接近地面血点越多，把豆秸揭开，在一堆紫色血迹旁边，有一块带血和女人头发的砖头。侦察员用照像机拍下这些证据后，又按原样摆布起来。
    在这同时，法医对八具尸体最后解剖的结果，推翻了“煤气中毒”的鉴定，证明八人头部由于钝器敲打而骨折。至此，已经可以肯定这是一个杀人灭迹的凶杀案件。
    凶手是什么人？为什么要残忍地把全家八口人都杀害？这是侦察员们第二步需要侦察的任务。
    当侦察员正计划深入侦察以辨别案情的时候，农民报告杀人现场被人毁掉。经过侦察员的周密侦察，将毁掉杀人现场的邢德昌依法逮捕，加以审讯，这样案情大白了。
    案情是这样的：反动的富农分子邢德昌，在土地改革时期有部分多余土地被征收，后来这些土地被分配给贫农李景云，当时邢德昌对政府非常不满。李景云参加农业生产合作社以后，生活一天天地富裕起来，在分得邢德昌原来的土地上盖起了新房，邢德昌一看见这所新房就更加仇恨，企图杀掉李景云全家，纵火烧毁他的房子。
      一九五四年，反革命分子邢德昌积极拉拢用两面派手法钻进合作社并窃取计划委员职务的赵景贵。赵景贵是残余的反革命分子，他对邢德昌的罪恶活动百般支持，又把反动富农分子邢德贵拉在一起，计划趁机对李景云和合作社进行暗害和破坏活动。
    今年二月二十八日深夜，他们三人趁李景云参加社员大会的机会，把李景云的妻子夏雅珍诱骗出去，三人轮奸了夏雅珍，然后在邢德昌家的烟囱旁边残暴地用砖头将她砸死。然后又跳进屋里用木棒打死已经熟睡的李景云的父母、侄女、儿子和两个女儿，最后把夏雅珍的尸体抬进屋里扔到炕上。当李景云在深夜开完会回家刚走进屋里时，隐避起来的凶手便迎头一棒，又把李景云打死。反革命分子企图逃避罪行，最后放火烧毁房屋，企图焚尸灭迹。
    这个案件已在最近由当地公安机关侦讯完毕，国家即将给予这些凶恶的反革命分子以严厉的惩处。
    这个残暴的反革命凶杀案件激起了当地人民极大的痛恨，他们纷纷要求严厉惩处这些罪大恶极的反革命杀人犯，并决心提高警惕，擦亮眼睛，将一切暗藏的反革命分子彻底肃清干净。
