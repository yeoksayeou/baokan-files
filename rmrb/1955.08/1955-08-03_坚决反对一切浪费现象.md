    Tens of Thousands of Jin of Waste Cotton Buried
    Editor:
    The Jiamusi Textile Factory had accumulated a large amount of waste cotton in the past. In the spring of 1954, they sold some of the waste cotton to the Shenyang Paper Mill. Because there were too many impurities in the waste cotton, the Shenyang Paper Mill later said they didn't want it. From April to October 1954, the Cost Accounting Section of the textile factory successively dug pits and buried the waste cotton. Recently, the factory's Supervision Office discovered this situation and urged the administrative leadership to organize workers to excavate. In the 21 pits that have been excavated, there were more than 16,000 kilograms of cotton waste, card fly, roving ends, and floor sweepings, worth more than 4,800 yuan in Renminbi. In addition, a piece of white tarpaulin, 48 kilograms of bale covering cloth, and more than 500 straw mats were also dug out.
    The Cost Accounting Section also decided in April 1954 to stop collecting floor sweepings from the loom workshop. As a result, the floor sweepings were thrown into trash cans and hauled outside the factory in large carts. Whenever the factory's carts hauled waste cotton to the suburbs, many residents and workers' families would go to pick it up, and there were even fights over picking up the waste cotton. According to statistics from the loom workshop, more than 35,000 kilograms of floor sweepings, worth about 6,000 yuan in Renminbi, were thrown away in the year from last April to this April. According to residents who picked up waste cotton and cart drivers, the waste cotton thrown away also contained toothpicks, water pipes, yarn ends, bale covering cloth and other materials.
    This factory's attitude towards state property is intolerable. Even though there are too many impurities in the waste cotton, it can still be sold after being sorted; however, in order to "save trouble," they adopted the method of burying and throwing it away. It is worth noting that the higher authorities had notified this factory to report the amount of waste cotton so that it could be sold in a unified manner; however, this factory completely ignored the instructions from above. It is said that these things were all decided by the Cost Accounting Section, and the factory leaders were not aware of them. If this is really the case, the bureaucratic work style of the factory leaders is too serious.
    We believe that the relevant higher leading authorities should seriously deal with this matter and give the relevant personnel the punishment they deserve.

    Extravagant and Wasteful Inauguration Ceremony
    Editor:
    The 507 Power Plant of the Southwest Electric Power Administration also held an extravagant and wasteful ceremony when it went into operation. Under the false pretext that "the scale of the inauguration ceremony should be commensurate with the modern and latest equipment," the leading staff of this factory squandered more than 52,000 yuan of state property.
    In this inauguration ceremony, the entertainment expenses alone amounted to more than 10,000 yuan, of which more than 1,500 yuan was wasted due to the blind purchase of food that could not be eaten. Fifty gold commemorative badges, each weighing about half a tael, were customized, but nine of them were left over after they could not be given away. 13,000 bronze commemorative badges were customized, and more than 4,000 were left over after being given away. These two items cost about 12,000 yuan in total. Including photography, making silk banners, etc., the total expenditure was nearly 20,000 yuan, of which the remaining items were worth more than 5,000 yuan. A total of 51 bolts of various colored fabrics and 3,000 meters of insulated wire were used for making decorations. One hundred palace lanterns were customized, but only eight were used. The purchase of these items cost more than 14,000 yuan, of which 5,100 yuan was wasted due to stockpiling. In addition, the factory also took the opportunity of the inauguration ceremony to "grab a handful" and purchased and customized tea trays, teacups, vases, etc., worth more than 4,000 yuan.
    The erroneous practice of the leading staff of the 507 Factory, who were fond of showing off and being ostentatious, was not limited to this inauguration ceremony. This factory also spent more than 140,000 yuan to build a large auditorium that could accommodate twice as many employees as the factory's total number of employees. The factory already had more than 100 sets of khaki work clothes, but they were remade because they disliked the "unattractive" color. There are many similar things.
    It should be pointed out that the Southwest Electric Power Administration has adopted a tolerant attitude towards the waste of the 507 Factory. For example, they first approved an inauguration ceremony fee of 25,000 yuan for the 507 Factory. When the actual expenditure reached 52,000 yuan, they did not check and report it, but prepared to let it go. It was not until the higher authorities discovered it and ordered an inspection that they made a self-criticism. Because the extravagant and wasteful phenomenon of the 507 Factory was not corrected in time, other enterprises under this administration often used the 507 Factory as a comparison when it came to welfare facilities.
    I believe that the Southwest Electric Power Administration should correct the error of adopting a tolerant attitude towards waste and immediately investigate the waste of the 507 Factory.　Song Yusheng

    Blind Procurement Leads to Stockpiling
    Editor:
    In addition to submitting a plan to the Materials Department of the Second Engineering Bureau of the New Railway Construction General Bureau of the Ministry of Railways for the purchase of 100,000 loads of earth baskets, the Eighth Work Section under it also organized a procurement team to purchase on its own initiative in Guangyuan and other areas of Sichuan this year. This unit did not study the actual needs, but was simply afraid that there would not be enough earth baskets, so it blindly ordered a huge purchase number. As a result, when these earth baskets were concentrated at Xiaheba in Guangyuan, the entire river dam was piled up like small hills. According to the figures calculated in June of this year, there were more than 250,000 loads of earth baskets in stock, which, calculated at 2.6 jiao per load, amounted to more than 60,000 yuan in stockpiled funds. Because there are too many stockpiled, if they are not stacked properly, a large number of earth baskets may be scrapped.
    I believe that the leaders of the Eighth Work Section should be responsible for this matter.

    坚决反对一切浪费现象
    成万斤的废棉被埋掉了编辑同志：
    佳木斯纺织厂过去积存了大批废棉。一九五四年春，他们曾把一部分废棉卖给沈阳造纸厂。因为废棉中杂物太多，后来沈阳造纸厂提出不要了，纺织厂成本科在一九五四年四月到十月间竟陆续挖坑把废棉埋掉了。最近这个厂的监察室发现了这个情况，督促行政领导方面组织工人挖掘。在已挖掘的二十一个坑里，就有抄斩花、车肚花、纱头、地脚棉等一万六千多公斤，价值人民币四千八百多元。另外，还挖出白色苫布一块、包皮布四十八公斤、草帘子五百多个。
    成本科还曾在一九五四年四月决定不再收运布机车间的地脚棉。因此，地脚棉都被扔在垃圾箱里，用大车拉到厂外扔掉。每当厂里的大车拉着废棉到郊外时，就有很多居民和工人家属去拣，甚至还曾发生为了抢拣废棉而互相打架的事。根据布机车间统计，从去年四月到今年四月一年中，共扔掉地脚棉三万五千多公斤，约值人民币六千元。据拣废棉的居民和赶大车的工人反映，扔掉的废棉中还混有牙轮、水管、纱头、包皮布等物资。
    这个厂对待国家财产的这种态度是令人不能容忍的。废棉中虽然杂物太多，拣清以后还是可以出售的；但是他们为了“省心”，竟采取了埋掉和扔掉的办法。值得注意的是：当时上级机关曾通知这个厂上报下脚棉的数量，以便统一出售；但是这个厂对上级指示根本置之不理。这些事情据说都是成本科决定的，厂的领导人员并不知道。如果真的这样，这个厂的领导人员官僚主义作风实在太严重了。
    我们认为，有关上级领导机关应该严肃处理这件事情，并给有关人员以应得的处分。

    铺张浪费的开车典礼编辑同志：
    西南电业管理局五○七发电厂在开车时也曾举行了一次铺张浪费的典礼。这个厂的领导工作人员在“开车典礼的规模应该和现代化的最新设备相适应”的错误借口下，挥霍了国家财产五万二千多元。
    在这次开车典礼中，仅招待费一项就开支了一万多元，其中由于盲目购买吃不完而浪费的达一千五百多元。定制了每枚重约半两的金质纪念章五十枚，结果送不完还剩余九枚；定制了铜质纪念章一万三千枚，赠送后剩余四千多枚。这两项共用去约一万二千元。加上摄影、制锦旗等共开支了近二万元，其中剩余物品值五千多元。为了扎彩，共用了各种色布五十一匹和三千公尺绝缘电线。定制了一百只宫灯，结果只用了八个。买这类东西共花了一万四千多元，其中积压浪费达五千一百多元。此外，厂里还利用开车典礼的机会“抓一把”，购买和定制了价值四千多元的茶盘、茶杯、花瓶等。
    五○七厂领导工作人员讲阔气、爱排场的错误做法并不止开车典礼这一次。这个工厂还花十四万多元盖了一座能容纳比该厂职工总人数多一倍的大礼堂。厂里已有一百多套卡琪布的工作服，因为嫌颜色“不好”又重做了。类似的事情还有不少。
    应该指出的是，西南电业管理局对五○七厂的浪费现象，竟采取了容忍的态度。例如，他们先批准五○七厂开车典礼费二万五千元，当实际开支达到五万二千元的时候，他们不加检查和上报，而准备不了了之。等到上级机关发觉后，指令检查，他们才作检讨。由于五○七厂这种铺张浪费现象没有得到及时纠正，这个管理局所属其他企业对待福利设施方面的要求，也就经常拿五○七厂来做比较。
    我认为，西南电业管理局应该纠正对待浪费现象采取容忍态度的错误，并且立即查究五○七厂的浪费行为。　宋余生
    盲目采购造成积压编辑同志：
    铁道部新建铁路工程总局第二工程局所属第八工段在今年年初除了向第二工程局材料处提出了要求代购十万担土箕的计划外，又自行组织了一个采购组到四川广元等地区采购。这个单位并没有研究实际需要，只是深怕土箕不够用，就盲目订出了一个巨大的采购数字。结果当这些土箕集中在广元的下河坝的时候，遍河坝都堆得像小山头一样。据今年六月计算的数字，积压的土箕共有二十五万多担，每担以二角六分计算，共积压资金六万多元。由于积压的数量太多，堆放得不好，可能会有大批土箕要报废。
    我认为第八工段的领导人应该对这件事负责。
