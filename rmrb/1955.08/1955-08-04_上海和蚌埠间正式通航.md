    Formal Navigation Between Shanghai and Bengbu Begins
    The first tugboat departing from Shanghai, towing eight barges fully loaded with supplies, safely arrived in Bengbu on July 25th after more than seven days of navigation. From this point forward, formal navigation between Shanghai and Bengbu has begun.
    This route passes through the Yangtze River, the Grand Canal, the Subei Irrigation Main Canal, and the Huai River, and traverses seven lakes, including Hongze Lake. It passes through 22 major cities and towns, including Shanghai, Wuxi, Suzhou, Jiangyin, Gaoyou, Xuyi, Wuhe, and Bengbu, with a total length of more than 700 kilometers. This waterway can operate year-round, day and night, which will not only greatly improve vessel turnover and reduce transportation costs, but also alleviate the excessive burden on railway transportation between Bengbu and Shanghai.

    上海和蚌埠间正式通航
    从上海开出的第一艘拖轮拖着八只满载物资的驳船，经过七天多的航行，在七月二十五日安全到达蚌埠。从此，上海和蚌埠间正式通航了。
    这条航线经过长江、运河、苏北灌溉总渠、淮河，并横贯洪泽湖等七个湖泊，途经上海、无锡、苏州、江阴、高邮、盱眙、五河、蚌埠等二十二个主要市（城）镇，全长七百多公里。这条航道可以终年开班，日夜航行，不仅能够大大发挥船舶周转率和降低运输成本，同时也减轻了蚌埠到上海间铁路运输的过重负担。（吴访军）
