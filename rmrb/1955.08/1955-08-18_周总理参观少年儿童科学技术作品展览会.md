Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Zhou Enlai, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, admired the scientific, technological, and craft works of the children of New China this evening and met with fifty-four young science and technology enthusiasts from all over the country. Premier Zhou Enlai encouraged these little scientists and little craftsmen, saying that since you can create these scientific, technological, and craft works when you are young, you will surely be able to successfully build socialism and communism as long as you do not become arrogant when you grow up.

　　At 7:30 PM, Premier Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Deng Yingchao, Hu Yaobang, Hu Keshi, and Zhang Ze, visited the National Exhibition of Scientific, Technological, and Craft Works of Children and Adolescents, accompanied by Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council. The fifty-four young scientists and craftsmen wearing red scarves stood at the entrance, excitedly applauding a warm welcome.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai visited the four sections of the exhibition: natural geography, physics, biology, and craft works. Premier Zhou Enlai often smiled happily when he saw the children's various meticulous creations. He spoke kindly and warmly with many young creators about the process of making these works and the uses of the products, and carefully watched the children's various model performances. In front of a telephone model, Premier Zhou Enlai even made a phone call with the children. When visiting the large-grained sunflower seeds harvested by the children of the "Michurin Group" in a primary school in Zhejiang Province, Premier Zhou Enlai said to Chen Qikun, the representative of the group and a small agronomist, "After you go back, you should summarize this experience so that it can be promoted to others."

　　After the visit, a joyful evening party was held.

　　Chen Min, a representative of the children, said at the evening party: Hearing that Premier Zhou was coming, everyone jumped up with joy. "If there were no gravity, we would jump into the sky." She said that in the future, we will definitely work harder to study, exercise, and not be arrogant or complacent, so that we can repay the motherland for its expectations of us.

　　She asked Premier Zhou to forward the children's two letters, red scarves, and a small electric car model to Chairman Mao as gifts. This small electric car model was recently rushed to completion by Hua Binger, a child from Wuxi City, specifically for presentation to Chairman Mao.

　　Premier Zhou then spoke at the meeting. He encouraged the children to listen to Chairman Mao, to be healthy, study well, and work well, and praised the children's achievements. Premier Zhou also said to the children, "It is not possible to build socialism by relying on just a few dozen of you. As long as you rely on all the working people, you will definitely be able to build China's communist society."

　　Afterwards, young artists from the capital performed many programs. Before leaving, Premier Zhou and others also took pictures with the children. (Attached picture)

    周总理参观少年儿童科学技术作品展览会
    新华社十七日讯　中共中央书记处书记、中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来，在今天晚上欣赏了新中国孩子们的科学技术和工艺作品，并和来自全国各地的五十四位少年科学技术爱好者会见。周恩来总理勉励这些小科学家和小工艺家们说，你们小的时候，就能作出这些科学技术和工艺作品来，长大了只要不骄傲，一定能够把社会主义和共产主义建设成功。
    下午七时半，周恩来总理由邓颖超、胡耀邦、胡克实、章泽陪同，到全国少年儿童科学技术和工艺作品展览会参观，同来的还有国务院秘书长习仲勋。五十四位戴着红领巾的小科学家和小工艺家们，都站在门口兴奋地热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    周恩来总理参观了展览会的自然地理、物理、生物和工艺作品等四部分。周恩来总理在看到孩子们各种精心的创作时，常常高兴地笑起来。他慈爱而又亲切地和许多年幼的制作者本人交谈着他们制作这些作品的经过和制品的用途，并仔细地观看孩子们的各种模型表演。在一个电话机模型前，周恩来总理还和孩子们通了电话。在参观浙江省一个小学里“米丘林小组”的孩子们所收获的颗粒肥大的向日葵种籽时，周恩来总理对这个小组的代表、小农艺家陈其坤说：“你回去后要把这个经验总结起来，好向别人推广。”
    参观后，还举行了一个快乐的晚会。
    孩子们的代表陈敏在晚会上讲话说：听说周总理要来，大家都高兴地跳了起来，“如果没有地心吸力，我们会跳上天空。”她说，以后我们一定加倍努力学习，锻炼身体，不骄傲，不自满，这样才能报答祖国对我们的期望。
    她请周总理代为转致孩子们给毛主席的两封信、红领巾和一辆小电车模型等礼物。这个小电车模型是来自无锡市的小朋友华炳尔在最近专为赠送给毛主席而刚刚赶制成的。
    周总理接着在会上讲话。他勉励孩子们听毛主席的话，作到身体好，学习好，工作好，并称赞孩子们的成绩。周总理又对孩子们说，光靠你们几十个人是不能建设社会主义的。你们只要依靠全体劳动人民，一定可以建成中国的共产主义社会。
    随后，首都小艺术家们演出了许多节目。在临别时，周总理等还和孩子们一起照了像。（附图片）
