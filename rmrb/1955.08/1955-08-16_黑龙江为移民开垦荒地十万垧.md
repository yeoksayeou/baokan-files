Heilongjiang Province plans to reclaim 100,000 hectares of wasteland this summer, autumn, and before next year's spring plowing, to provide land for immigrants moving into the province after the autumn harvest. This land reclamation plan mainly relies on agricultural producers' cooperatives and year-round mutual aid teams to complete, with state-owned farms and agricultural machinery stations also undertaking a portion of the task. According to statistics from 24 counties, including Keshan and Hailun, of the more than 50,000 hectares of wasteland to be reclaimed for immigrants this autumn and next spring, agricultural producers' cooperatives and year-round mutual aid teams will reclaim more than 37,000 hectares. Currently, various localities have implemented the land reclamation plan down to the village level.

The province's state-owned farms and agricultural machinery stations have already drawn a large number of manpower, tractors, and agricultural implements to invest in land reclamation work. Tongbei Farm has now reclaimed 300 hectares of wasteland for immigrants. Farms such as Jiusan and Baoquanling have also successively started land reclamation work. In late July, the Keshan Beixing Agricultural Machinery Station dispatched twelve tractors to the vast and flat wasteland of Beixing District and Beilian District in Keshan County to carry out land reclamation day and night. Employees of the Nehe Qinglong Agricultural Machinery Station also launched a labor competition in land reclamation, and by mid-July, they had completed more than 43 percent of the land reclamation plan.

    黑龙江为移民开垦荒地十万垧
    黑龙江省计划在今年夏、秋和明年春耕前开垦荒地十万垧，供给秋后迁入该省的移民耕种。这项开荒计划，主要依靠农业生产合作社和常年互助组来完成，国营农场和农业机器站也负担一部分任务。据克山、海伦等二十四县的统计，今秋明春要为移民开垦的五万余垧荒地，其中由农业生产合作社和常年互助组开垦的有三万七千余垧。目前，各地已将开荒计划贯彻到村。
    全省国营农场和农业机器站已经抽出大批人力和拖拉机、农具投入开荒工作。通北农场现已为移民开出荒地三百垧。九三、宝泉岭等农场也先后开始了开荒工作。克山北兴农业机器站在七月下旬，抽派了十二台拖拉机到克山县北兴区、北联区广阔平坦的荒原上日夜进行开荒。讷河青龙农业机器站的职工在开荒中，还开展了劳动竞赛，到七月中旬就完成开荒计划百分之四十三以上。
