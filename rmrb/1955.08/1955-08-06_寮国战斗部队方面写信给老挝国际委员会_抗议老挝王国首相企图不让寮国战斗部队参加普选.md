Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 5th: According to "Lao News" on July 29th: The head of the political delegation of the Lao Fighting Units wrote a letter to the International Commission of Laos on July 26th, protesting against the statement made by the Prime Minister of the Lao Kingdom, Katay Don Sasorith, attempting to prevent the Lao Fighting Units from participating in the general election.

The protest letter pointed out that Katay Don Sasorith had declared at a rally in Vientiane on July 19th that if the Lao Fighting Units were unwilling to surrender to the Kingdom Government, the Kingdom Government would not allow the Lao Fighting Units to participate in the upcoming general election. On July 22nd, when Katay Don Sasorith visited Thailand, he said in response to reporters' questions: "The Kingdom Government's power cannot be established in the two provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly, but this issue cannot be an obstacle to holding general elections in the ten provinces first. After the Kingdom Government establishes power in the two northern provinces, general elections will be held in these two provinces."

The protest letter pointed out that the above two statements prove that the Lao Kingdom Government is attempting to force the Lao Fighting Units to surrender unconditionally to the Kingdom Government. If they do not, the Kingdom Government will conduct separate general elections in the ten provinces without the participation of the Lao Fighting Units, and will use troops to attack the two provinces where the Lao Fighting Units are concentrated to eliminate the Lao Fighting Units.

The head of the Lao political delegation said in the letter, "We ask the International Commission to pay attention to the Kingdom Government's deliberate violation of the Geneva Accords, failure to resolve fundamental political issues, conspiracy to seize the two provinces assigned to the Lao Fighting Units for regroupment, and adoption of discriminatory and retaliatory measures against former resistance personnel, in order to prevent Lao personnel from participating in national common life. This attempt will only lead to the result that freedom cannot be guaranteed for the Lao people and foreign aggression will be provoked again."

The letter finally requested the International Commission of Laos to take all effective measures to make the Kingdom Government abandon the above-mentioned attempts, sincerely fulfill the Geneva Accords, consult with the Lao side, allow the Lao side to participate in free general elections, abandon all actions, words, and attitudes that may lead to mutual suspicion and misunderstanding, and create a favorable atmosphere for negotiations to achieve good results.

    寮国战斗部队方面写信给老挝国际委员会
    抗议老挝王国首相企图不让寮国战斗部队参加普选
    新华社河内五日讯　据“寮国新闻”七月二十九日讯：寮国战斗部队政治代表团团长在七月二十六日写信给老挝国际委员会，对老挝王国首相克特所发表的企图不让寮国战斗部队参加普选的声明表示抗议。
    抗议信指出，克特曾在七月十九日在万象的一次集会上宣称，如果寮国战斗部队不愿向王国政府投降，王国政府将不准许寮国战斗部队参加即将到来的普选。七月二十二日，克特访问泰国时在答记者问时又说：“王国政府的政权不能在桑怒和丰沙里两省建立，但是，这个问题不能成为在十省先进行普选的阻碍，当王国政府在北部两省建立政权之后，再在这两省进行普选。”
    抗议信指出，以上两个声明证明，老挝王国政府企图迫使寮国战斗部队无条件向王国政府投降，如果不这样，王国政府将在十省单独进行没有寮国战斗部队参加的普选，并且将利用军队向寮国战斗部队集结的两省进攻，来消灭寮国战斗部队。
    寮国政治代表团团长在信中说，我们请国际委员会注意王国政府蓄意违反日内瓦协定，不解决根本政治问题，阴谋侵占划归寮国战斗部队集结的两省，对前抗战人员采取歧视和报复措施，借以不让寮国人员参加国家共同生活。这种企图只会引起这样的结果，即：不能为老挝人民保证自由，再次挑起外国的侵略战争。
    信中最后要求老挝国际委员会采取一切有效措施使王国政府放弃上列企图，真诚地履行日内瓦协定，和寮国方面进行协商，让寮国方面参加自由普选，抛弃一切可能导致互相猜疑和误解的行动、言语和态度，为谈判达成良好结果创造有利气氛。
