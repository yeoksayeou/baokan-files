    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 8th: According to Kyodo News Agency, the Japanese Ministry of Justice decided on the afternoon of the 6th to permit representatives from the Soviet Union, China, and Eastern European People's Democratic countries to enter the country to attend the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. However, the Japanese Ministry of Justice continues to refuse entry to representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to attend the conference. As previously reported, the Korean side had already protested this earlier.

    The Japanese government initially attempted to completely ban representatives from the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries from entering the country, an attempt that aroused widespread protests from the Japanese people. Later, on August 2nd, the Ministry of Justice once again announced that it would only allow a portion (ten) of the representatives from these countries to enter the country, but this measure also failed to ease opposition from all sides. The Japanese government's attitude has been criticized as being contrary to the promise made by Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama to the persons in charge of the preparatory work for the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs as early as July 21st. At that time, Hatoyama said to Tetsu Katayama, Akira Kazami, Ikuo Yasui, and others, "The World Conference is a good thing, and the government will provide assistance."

    As the opening date of the conference approached, the calls for protest became stronger and stronger. Earlier on the 6th, the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, which had just opened in Hiroshima, sent a telegram to the Japanese government demanding that all foreign representatives be allowed to enter the country. Representatives from organizations such as the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan-Soviet Union Friendship Association also met with Justice Minister Shiro Hanamura on the morning of the 6th, requesting early approval for representatives from democratic countries to enter the country. At the same time, Speaker of the House of Representatives Hideji Masutani, the Democratic Party, and various opposition parties also requested approval for these representatives to enter the country. According to Kyodo News Agency, it was under these circumstances that the Ministry of Justice made the new decision.

    在禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会和日本各界的要求和抗议下
    日本政府准许中、苏和东欧人民民主国家代表入境
    新华社八日讯　东京消息：据共同社报道，日本法务省已在六日下午决定准许应邀参加禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会的苏联、中国和东欧人民民主国家代表入境。虽然如此，日本法务省却继续拒绝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表入境参加大会。前已报道，朝鲜方面早先已经对此提出过抗议。
    日本政府最初曾经企图完全禁止苏联和人民民主国家的代表入境，这种企图激起了日本人民广泛的抗议。后来，法务省又一度在八月二日宣布只准许这些国家的一部分（十名）代表入境，但是，这种措施也并没有能够缓和各方面的反对。日本政府的态度被指责为是和日本首相鸠山一郎早在七月二十一日对禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会的筹备工作负责人所作的诺言相违背的。当时，鸠山曾对片山哲、风见章、安井郁等人说，“世界大会是很好的事情，政府要予以协助。”
    随着大会开幕日期的来临，抗议的呼声愈来愈强烈。就在六日的早些时候，刚在广岛开幕的禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会就曾打电报给日本政府要求准许全体外国代表入境。日本工会总评议会、日中友好协会、日苏亲善协会等团体的代表，也曾在六日上午会晤法务相花村四郎，要求及早批准民主国家代表入境。同时，国会众议院议长益谷秀次、民主党和各在野党也都要求批准这些代表入境。据共同社说，是在这种情况下，法务省才作出了新的决定。
