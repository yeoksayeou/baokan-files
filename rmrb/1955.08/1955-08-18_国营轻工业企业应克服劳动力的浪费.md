    State-Owned Light Industry Enterprises Should Overcome Labor Waste
    Tang Gongcai, Deputy Director of the Labor and Wage Department of the Ministry of Light Industry
    In recent years, state-owned light industry enterprises have done some work in rationally using labor. For example, they have divided production areas, clarified departmental responsibilities, and established a relatively normal production order; internal allocation has been implemented for enterprises with surplus or insufficient labor. According to incomplete statistics, in 1954 alone, more than 2,000 workers were transferred between the various specialized bureaus of the Ministry of Light Industry, and even more were transferred within each specialized bureau. Labor allocation between regions has also begun. This work has played a positive role in improving labor efficiency. However, judging from the current state of labor organization in various enterprises, the phenomenon of labor waste and surplus is still quite common and serious. This is mainly manifested in the following aspects:

    First, the growth rate of labor, especially the growth rate of management personnel and non-industrial personnel, exceeds the needs of production development, resulting in bloated organizations, overlapping structures, overstaffing, and low work efficiency. In 1952, management personnel in state-owned light industry accounted for only 8% of production workers, but in 1954, this rose to 10.8%. In some enterprises, such as the Southwest 601 Paper Mill, management personnel accounted for as much as 40% of the total number of production workers in 1954. In 1952, non-industrial personnel in state-owned light industry accounted for only 9.36% of the total number of employees, but in 1954, this increased to 13.97%. The number of non-industrial personnel in the Shiyan Paper Mill and Jinzhou Paper Mill was more than 40% of the number of production workers. Due to the excessive number of management and non-industrial personnel, the overall efficiency of enterprises has been reduced. In 1952, the overall efficiency of state-owned light industry was 72% of labor productivity, which decreased to 68% in 1953, and further decreased to 67% in 1954.

    Among the increase in management personnel, the welfare system has increased the most. Before liberation, bureaucratic capitalists only cared about making money and completely ignored the welfare facilities of employees. Many enterprises did not even have clinics. After liberation, with the development of production, it was entirely necessary to gradually establish some necessary welfare undertakings and increase some management personnel. However, some enterprises are now running businesses that should be run by society, such as bathhouses and restaurants operating outside the factory. This is not right.

    Second, statutory working days and effective working hours are not fully utilized. In the first half of this year, the utilization rate of effective working days in state-owned light industry was only 89.14%. Work stoppages and absenteeism resulted in a loss of more than 1.4 million working days, equivalent to more than 9,000 workers not working for half a year.

    Third, when some enterprises have difficulty completing production tasks, they do not improve labor organization, promote advanced experience, or tap potential capabilities, but simply rely on increasing workers to solve the problem. Some units even have a large number of redundant personnel that have not been dealt with, and then recruit new workers. The labor force in state-owned cigarette industrial enterprises, like equipment, has been surplus since liberation, but at the end of last year, some factories recruited new workers in order to "catch up with tasks." In March of this year, Jilin Paper Mill had 231 redundant personnel that had not been dealt with, and when faced with urgent tasks, it recruited 309 temporary workers.

    Some capital construction units prepare preparatory personnel and production personnel too early, too much, and illegally. For example, the planned construction of several sugar factories in Guangdong was only approved in March 1955, and production will not begin until 1957, but the personnel responsible for preparing for the construction of the factories recruited a group of workers for training in August of last year without the approval of the competent authorities. The expansion plan of Qingdao No. 2 Rubber General Factory has not been determined, but the factory has already recruited 250 students for training. The technology of light industry is not as complex as that of heavy industry, and it is unnecessary to recruit workers for training before the construction plan task is determined. Even if it is necessary, it should be solved through internal allocation, and unauthorized recruitment of workers not only wastes labor but also violates the country's labor law.

    Fourth, some enterprises transfer too many experienced veteran workers to non-technical jobs, preventing them from using their expertise. If too many senior technicians are transferred, a large number of new workers must be used to supplement them, resulting in a decline in the technical level of the enterprise, unstable product quality, increased accidents, and a decline in labor productivity.

    The waste of labor is inseparable from the lack of economic accounting thinking among the leaders and staff at all levels of enterprises. Erroneous arguments such as "more people make things easier," "labor costs account for a small proportion of product costs," and "failure to complete production tasks results in punishment, while failure to complete labor plans results in at most a self-criticism" are still circulating among the leading staff of some enterprises. These comrades should be made to correctly understand the relationship between rationally using labor and reducing costs and expanding capital accumulation, and help them understand the potential of labor. For example, the second workshop of the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Pharmaceutical Factory previously requested an increase in workers whenever tasks were urgent. Later, after the factory helped to determine the utilization of working hours, the workshop leaders realized that if the original labor force was used rationally, not only would there be no need to increase workers during urgent tasks, but the number of workers could also be reduced by one-sixth.

    The lack of standard staffing and quota standards in enterprises is also a cause of labor waste. Because there is no standard staffing, the institutions set up by the same enterprise are different, and the personnel allocation is different. Some enterprises allocate more personnel to departments and offices responsible for production and technical management, while others allocate more personnel to departments such as general affairs, welfare, and transportation. Because there are no quota standards, the number of personnel allocated to the same equipment varies in different enterprises. For example, the staffing of cigarette machines is seven people for three machines in Tianjin Cigarette Factory, five people for two machines in Fuxin Cigarette Factory, and three people for one machine in Qingdao Cigarette Factory (recently unified to five people for two machines). The way to eliminate this chaos is: first, to classify enterprises and establish a unified staffing and management system; second, to formulate or revise accurate working hour quotas and conduct staffing work according to the quotas; third, to stipulate the proportion of various types of personnel according to the characteristics of different enterprises.

    Another important reason for labor waste is poor production management, such as delays in technical supply that cause work stoppages, failure to implement the planned preventive maintenance system that causes many equipment accidents, and poor industrial hygiene environments that cause high employee sickness rates. Because of these reasons, the utilization rate of effective working days is low, and production is unbalanced. In order to meet the needs of "shock tasks," some enterprises reserve so-called "backup personnel" and "mobile personnel" in their labor plans. To change this situation, every enterprise must strengthen internal and external contacts and collaboration, and do a good job in technical supply to ensure normal supply. Enterprises with difficulties in raw material supply should mobilize employees to save raw materials and find substitutes. In addition, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the planned preventive maintenance system for equipment and improve maintenance quality to ensure the normal operation of machines; it is necessary to appropriately improve the industrial environment and hygiene and strengthen mass hygiene work in order to improve attendance rates.

    After doing the above work, many enterprises will have surplus labor. The redundant personnel must be arranged conscientiously and responsibly, such as transferring them to support new factories, transferring those with prospects for cultivation to secondary technical schools, and mobilizing those who have lost their ability to work to retire in accordance with labor protection regulations.

    In the future, due to the different production development situations of various enterprises in various periods, the phenomenon of surplus or insufficient labor will still occur frequently. The way to solve the problem of surplus or insufficient labor is to implement internal allocation. The experience of the past few years has proved that departmentalism is the main obstacle to internal allocation. Some units with surplus labor attempt to "unload burdens," "change ingredients," and "clean up internally" through internal allocation, transferring the old, weak, disabled, and those with other problems to other units. Some units that need to supplement labor inappropriately raise the conditions for receiving workers, such as requiring higher education levels, lower wages, good ingredients, young and strong bodies, and good skills. In fact, this is to reject internal allocation and attempt to recruit separately. Therefore, strengthening the overall concept of leaders and staff at all levels is an important political task for realizing internal allocation, rationally using labor, and ensuring that no new workers are added within a considerable period of time.

    国营轻工业企业应克服劳动力的浪费
    轻工业部劳动工资司副司长  唐恭才
    几年来，国营轻工业企业在合理使用劳动力方面做了一些工作。例如划分生产区域，划清科室职责，建立了比较正常的生产秩序；对劳动力多余或不足的企业，实行了内部调配。据不完全的统计，一九五四年内，轻工业部各专业局之间调配的工人有两千人以上，各专业局内部调配的人数更多。地区间的劳动力调配也已经开始。这些工作，对劳动效率的提高起了良好的作用。但从目前各企业劳动组织的状况来看，劳动力浪费和多余的现象还是相当普遍而严重的。这主要表现在以下几个方面：
    一、劳动力的增长速度，尤其是管理人员和非工业人员的增长速度，超过生产发展的需要，因而造成了机构庞大，组织重叠，人浮于事，工作效率低等现象。一九五二年国营轻工业管理人员只有生产工人的百分之八，一九五四年上升到百分之十点八。在某些企业中，例如西南六○一造纸厂，一九五四年管理人员竟达生产工人总数的百分之四十。一九五二年国营轻工业的非工业人员只占职工总数的百分之九点三六，一九五四年则增加到百分之十三点九七。石砚造纸厂和锦州造纸厂的非工业人员竟为生产工人的百分之四十以上。由于管理人员和非工业人员过多，企业的全员效能就降低了。一九五二年国营轻工业的全员效能为劳动生产率的百分之七十二，一九五三年下降为百分之六十八，一九五四年又下降为百分之六十七。
    在管理人员增长的比例中，又以福利系统增加最多。在解放以前，官僚资本家只顾赚钱，根本忽视职工的福利设施，许多企业连医务室也没有。解放以后，随着生产的发展，逐步举办一些必要的福利事业，增加一些管理人员是完全必要的。但现在有些应由社会上举办的事业，如对厂外经营的澡堂、饭馆等，个别企业也自己办。这是不对的。
    二、法定工日、有效工时没有充分利用。今年上半年，国营轻工业的有效工日利用率只达百分之八十九点一四，停工及缺勤损失共一百四十万多个工日，相当于九千多个工人半年不上班。
    三、有些企业在完成生产任务有困难的时候，不去改善劳动组织，推广先进经验，发掘潜在能力，而一味依靠增加工人来解决问题。有些单位甚至还有大批编余人员未处理，就又招收新工人。国营卷烟工业企业的劳动力，跟设备一样，解放以来都是有多余的，但在去年年终，有的工厂为了“赶任务”，又招收了新工人。吉林造纸厂今年三月有编余人员二百三十一人未处理，遇到任务紧急又招收三百零九名临时工人。
    有些基本建设单位过早、过多而又非法地准备筹备人员和生产人员。例如计划在广东新建的几个糖厂，一九五五年三月计划任务才批准，一九五七年才能开工生产，但是负责筹备建厂的人员未经主管部门批准，就在去年八月招收一批工人进行培训。青岛橡胶二总厂的扩建计划未定，但该厂早已招收二百五十名学生进行培训。轻工业的技术不像重工业那样复杂，建设的计划任务书未定就招收工人培养是不必要的。退一步说，即使有必要，也应从内部调配解决，而擅自招收工人，不仅浪费劳动力，而且违反了国家的劳动法。
    四、有些企业把过多的具有技术经验的老工人调去做非技术性的工作，使他们不能发挥专长。高级技术工人被调得太多，就不能不以大量的新工人来补充，结果是企业的技术等级下降，产品质量不稳定，事故增加，致使劳动生产率下降。
    劳动力的浪费是跟企业的各级领导工作人员缺乏经济核算思想分不开的。“人多好办事”、“人工占产品成本的比重不大”、“完不成生产任务受处分，而完不成劳动计划顶多作个检讨”等错误论调，现在还在一些企业的领导工作人员中间流传。有的人向劳动部门要人时，如劳动部门不给或少给，就以威胁的口吻说：“完不成任务你负责。”应该使这些同志正确认识合理地使用劳动力跟降低成本同扩大资金积累的关系，并帮助他们了解劳动力的潜力所在。例如国营上海药品一厂第二车间，以前每逢任务紧急时，就要求增加工人。后来经过厂里帮助查定工时的利用情况以后，车间领导工作人员才知道，如果合理使用原有劳动力，在任务紧急时，不但用不着增加工人，而且还可以减少六分之一的工人。
    企业里没有标准编制和定员标准，也是劳动力浪费的一个原因。因为没有标准编制，相同的企业所设置的机构不一样，人员配备不一样。有的企业配备给负责生产、技术管理的科、室的人员多一些，有的企业则配备给总务、福利、运输等部门的人员多一些。因为没有定员标准，相同的设备在不同的企业里所配备的人员就有多有少。例如卷烟机的定员，天津烟厂是七人看三台，福新烟厂是五人看两台，青岛烟厂是三人看一台（最近已统一为五人看两台）。消除这种混乱现象的办法，是：一、划分企业等级，建立统一的编制和管理制度；二、制定或修订确实的工时定额，根据定额进行定员工作；三、根据不同企业的特点，规定各类人员的比重。
    劳动力浪费的另一个重要原因是生产管理不善，例如技术供应不及时而造成停工待料，计划预防修理制度没贯彻而造成设备事故多，工业卫生环境不好而造成职工生病率高等等。由于这些原因，有效工日的利用率就低，生产也就不均衡。有些企业为了适应“突击任务”的需要，在劳动计划中，就留有所谓“后备人员”、“机动人员”。要改变这种情况，每一个企业必须加强企业内部同企业外部的联系和协作，做好技术供应工作，以保证正常的供应。原材料供应有困难的企业，应动员职工节约原材料，找代用品。此外，要认真贯彻设备的计划预防修理制度，提高检修质量，以保证机器的正常运转；要适当改善工业环境卫生，加强群众性的卫生工作，以便提高出勤率。
    做了上述各方面的工作以后，许多企业的劳动力就有剩余。对于编余的人员，必须认真地负责地给以安排，如调去支援新建工厂，抽调有培养前途的去中等技术学校学习，根据劳动保护条例动员那些失去劳动能力的职工退休等等。
    今后由于各企业在各个时期的生产发展的情况不同，劳动力的多余或不足的现象，还会经常发生的。解决劳动力多余或不足的办法是实行内部调配。过去几年的经验证明，本位主义是实行内部调配的主要障碍。有些有多余劳动力的单位，企图通过内部调配“卸包袱”、“换成份”、“清洗内部”，把老的、弱的、残废的、以及有其它问题的统统调给别的单位。有些需要补充劳动力的单位，则又不适当地提高接收工人的条件，如要文化程度高的、工资低的、成份好的、年青力壮的、技术好的等等。实际上，这是拒绝内部调配，企图另外招收。所以，加强各级领导工作人员的整体观念，乃是实现内部调配，合理使用劳动力，保证在相当时期内不增加新工人的一项重要政治工作。
