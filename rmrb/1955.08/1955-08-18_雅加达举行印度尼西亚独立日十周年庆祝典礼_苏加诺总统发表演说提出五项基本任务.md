Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 17th: The ceremony celebrating the tenth anniversary of Indonesian Independence Day was held in front of the "Independence Palace" on the morning of the 17th.

Attending the celebration were Indonesian President Sukarno, Vice President Hatta, cabinet ministers, armed forces officers, members of parliament, and foreign diplomats. Chinese Ambassador Huang Zhen, Zheng Zhenduo, head of the Chinese cultural delegation currently visiting Indonesia, and deputy head Zhou Erfu were also invited to attend the celebration.

Tens of thousands of people stood with flags in the square in front of the "Independence Palace."

President Sukarno delivered a speech, and Vice President Hatta read the Declaration of Independence from ten years prior. The national flag, which was raised when independence was declared ten years ago, was slowly raised as the national anthem was played.

The celebration concluded after a military parade by the army, navy, and air force.

In his speech, President Sukarno summarized the achievements Indonesia had made in the arduous struggle of the past ten years. He said that the struggle of the past ten years was "to defend the newly won freedom, to prevent the encroachment of the Dutch imperialists who attempted to restore their control, and to win international recognition for the product of the Indonesian national movement—the Republic of Indonesia."

When discussing the achievements of international activities, the President pointed out that Indonesia had established friendly relations with many countries. He emphasized: "The Republic of Indonesia, through the Asian-African Conference, has contributed to eliminating some international tensions, and now we can continue to pave the way that will lead to world understanding and peace."

When discussing the current situation, Sukarno said: Indonesia "still lives on the garbage heap of past colonial rule, on the ruins of colonial fortresses."

He said: "Colonialism has been defeated; but this does not mean that our society is now completely free from the remnants of colonialism, which has spread for decades, no, for centuries, in the organism of our society. West Irian is still suffering under the shackles of colonialism. The remnants of colonialism and the wounds it has brought are still visible not only in material, financial, and economic aspects; but also morality and personality cannot but be harmed by these parasitic characteristics, which are destroying the Indonesian nation."

Sukarno emphasized that it would still take a long time to clear away the remnants and ruins of colonialism, which still exist in various forms. He pointed out that security issues were also remnants of colonialism, citing the Republic of South Maluku, the "Islamic State Movement," and the situations in Aceh and South Sulawesi as examples. He said: "In fact, if we study it in depth, these riots are also completely remnants of colonialism. This is even clearer after it has been ascertained that Dutch elements who are indeed guilty have also participated in the riots."

After discussing the problems facing Indonesia, Sukarno put forward five basic tasks for the nation: strengthen national unity; suppress elements that may undermine national unity and disrupt public order; redouble efforts to carry out construction; continue to fight for the recovery of West Irian and the elimination of all remnants of imperialism and colonialism; and hold general elections throughout the country without delay.

Sukarno said that as long as vast areas of Asia and Africa are not free, colonialism has not died. He assured that Indonesia would not hesitate to provide moral support to all nations struggling for independence, such as Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Vietnam, and Malaya. Indonesia will do its utmost to fight until West Irian is recovered and the last imperialist and colonialist parasites are eliminated.

Sukarno demanded that the Dutch begin negotiations with Indonesia on the issue of transferring control of West Irian to Indonesia if the Dutch still wished to maintain good relations with Indonesia.

Sukarno spoke in detail about the importance of general elections and asked the people to choose those who are truly loyal to the Indonesian people rather than to foreign interest groups. He said, "Do not delay the election any longer. Do not let anyone sell out the election, or delay the holding of the election, or attempt to obstruct the election, attempt to sabotage the election, to destroy it, to make it fail. Otherwise, he is a traitor to the revolution, a traitor to democracy."

On the eve of Independence Day—the evening of the 16th—the Indonesian Parliament held a special meeting to celebrate the tenth anniversary of independence.

    雅加达举行印度尼西亚独立日十周年庆祝典礼
    苏加诺总统发表演说提出五项基本任务
    新华社雅加达十七日电　印度尼西亚独立日十周年庆祝典礼十七日上午在“独立宫”前面举行。
    出席庆祝典礼的有印度尼西亚总统苏加诺，副总统哈达，内阁各部部长，武装部队军官，国会议员和各国外交使节。中国大使黄镇，正在访问印度尼西亚的中国文化代表团团长郑振铎和副团长周而复也应邀参加了庆祝典礼。
    数万人民举着旗帜站在“独立宫”前面的广场上。
    苏加诺总统发表了演说，哈达副总统宣读了十年前的独立宣言。十年前宣布独立时飘扬的国旗在国歌声中徐徐上升。
    庆祝典礼在陆海空三军军事检阅后结束。
    苏加诺总统在演说中总结了印度尼西亚在过去十年的艰苦斗争中所取得的成就。他说，过去十年的斗争是“为了保卫新取得的自由，不让企图恢复它的控制的荷兰帝国主义侵犯，以及为了争取国际上承认印度尼西亚民族运动的产物——印度尼西亚共和国。”
    总统在谈到国际方面的活动的成就时指出，印度尼西亚已经同许多国家建立了友好关系。他强调指出：“印度尼西亚共和国通过亚非会议对于消除一部分国际紧张局势作出了贡献，现在我们可以继续铺平将导致世界互相谅解和和平的道路。”
    苏加诺在谈到当前的情况时说：印度尼西亚“仍然在过去殖民主义统治的垃圾堆上，在殖民主义堡垒的废墟上生活”。
    他说：“殖民主义已经被击垮；但是这并不是说我们的社会现在已经完全摆脱了殖民主义的残余，它在我们社会的机体里已经蔓延了几十年了，不，有几世纪了。西伊里安仍旧在殖民主义的枷锁下受难。殖民主义的残余和它所带来的创伤不仅在物质、财政和经济各方面仍旧可以看得出来；而且道德和个性也仍旧不能不受到这些寄生性特点的危害，这些寄生性特点正在毁坏着印度尼西亚民族。”
    苏加诺着重指出：要清除殖民主义的残余和废墟还需要走很长一段路，这种残余和废墟仍旧以它们各种各样的表现形式存在着。他指出安全问题也是殖民主义的残余，他举出南摩鹿加共和国、“回教国运动”和亚齐、南苏拉威西的情况作为例子。他说：“事实上，如果我们深入研究一下的话，这些动乱也完全是殖民主义的残余。在确实查明罪恶的荷兰分子也参与了骚乱以后，这一点就更加清楚了。”
    苏加诺在谈了印度尼西亚所面临的问题以后，提出了全国的五项基本任务：加强全国团结；镇压可能会破坏全国团结和扰乱治安的分子；加倍努力进行建设；继续为收回西伊里安和消灭帝国主义和殖民主义的一切残余而斗争；一天也不拖延地在全国举行普选。
    苏加诺说，只要亚洲非洲广大地区还没有自由，殖民主义就还没有死亡。他保证，印度尼西亚将毫不迟疑地给像突尼斯、阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥、越南、马来亚等这些为独立而斗争的一切民族以道义上的支援。印度尼西亚将尽全力进行斗争，直到收复了西伊里安、消灭了最后的帝国主义和殖民主义寄生虫时为止。
    苏加诺要求荷兰人就把西伊里安的控制权移交给印度尼西亚的问题同印度尼西亚开始谈判，如果荷兰人还希望印度尼西亚同荷兰保持良好关系的话。
    苏加诺详细谈到普选的重要性，并且要求人民选择真正忠于印度尼西亚人民而不是忠于外国利益集团的人。他说，“不要再延迟选举了。不要让任何人出卖选举，或拖延选举的举行，或企图阻挠选举，企图捣乱选举，破坏它、使它失败。否则，他就是革命的叛徒、民主的叛徒。”
    在独立纪念日前夕——十六日晚上，印度尼西亚国会举行了庆祝独立十周年的特别会议。
