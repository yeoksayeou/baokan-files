The Soviet Union's Rural Electrification Highly Developed
    In the circular hall of the "Agricultural Mechanization and Electrification Exhibition Hall" of the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition, there is a brightly lit map of the Soviet Union, densely studded with thousands of colored light bulbs, each representing a rural power station. From the map, one can see that large and small rural power stations not only supply electricity to the rural areas of central Soviet Union, but have also illuminated the remote rural areas of Central Asia, Siberia, the Baltic coast, the Far East, and within the Arctic Circle.

    The numbers and facts cited by the narrator are highly persuasive. In Ukraine, all state farms, machine tractor stations, and five thousand collective farms have now been electrified, and the generating capacity of rural hydroelectric power stations distributed throughout the republic has now increased to thirty times that of 1940. In Uzbekistan, more than 420 collective farms have now established their own power stations, and the number of power stations in the Shakhrisyabz district of Kashka-Darya Oblast alone is now equal to the total number of power stations in the entire territory of Uzbekistan before the October Revolution. Compared with 1940, the electricity consumption of collective farms and state farms across the Soviet Union has now increased by more than five times. In terms of the speed of electrification, the Soviet Union ranks first in the world.

    The Soviet Union's agricultural electrification is still developing further.

Soviet Union's First Widescreen Stereophonic Cinema Opens
    The first widescreen stereophonic cinema - the "Art" cinema - opened in Moscow on July 28.

    In ordinary cinemas, people can only see part of the streets, squares, and landscapes on the screen. In this cinema, the screen is as wide as 14 meters, greatly expanding the scope of projection. This screen is made of special plastic, which can make the projection more vivid.

    In addition to the widescreen, the new cinema is also equipped with special equipment that allows the audience to hear sounds coming from the left, right, beside them, and from the distance behind the screen. This is due to the simultaneous recording from four recording tapes, instead of one. The loudspeakers are now not only installed on both sides of the screen, but also behind the screen and in the theater.

    The Soviet Union is renovating and building many cinemas to widely screen widescreen stereophonic films. By next year, there will be fifty widescreen cinemas in the capitals of the various union republics and certain state centers. Twenty such cinemas are currently being planned for construction, each capable of accommodating one thousand to three thousand people. Several documentaries and specially made films for widescreen are currently being produced.

Korean Graduates This Year Exceed Previous Years
    This year, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has 8,800 students graduating from various universities and secondary technical schools, a number exceeding the number of graduates in previous years.

    Of the more than 2,000 students graduating from universities, most will participate in industrial construction and educational work. Of the more than 5,000 graduates from secondary technical schools, 83 percent will work in various industrial sectors, and most of the others will go to rural economic sectors.

    Higher education and secondary technical education in Korea have developed rapidly in the ten years since the "August 15" Liberation. Before liberation, there was not even one regular university in northern Korea, and there were only three technical schools. Now there are 17 universities and 72 technical schools nationwide. Over the past ten years, these schools have trained more than 32,700 construction talents in various fields for the country.

Czechoslovakia Creates Method of Weaving Cloth Directly from Cotton Sheets
    The staff of the Brno Knitting Research Institute in Czechoslovakia recently created a new weaving method that can eliminate the process of spinning warp yarn and weave cloth directly from cotton sheets.

    The working process of this new weaving method is as follows: First, the cotton is made into a cotton roll through an ordinary cotton cleaning machine, and then thoroughly cleaned of impurities by an ordinary carding machine. Then, instead of making it into a cotton sliver to go through the spinning process, its fibers are aligned in parallel to become very fine cotton sheets, which continuously enter a newly designed knitting machine to weave cloth. This knitting machine has two rows of special needles with weft yarn on the top and bottom. After the machine is started, these two rows of needles pass through the cotton sheets up and down, and use cotton yarn to firmly buckle the fibers of the cotton sheets horizontally to weave cloth.

    Because this weaving method completely eliminates the spinning process of warp yarn, it can weave 300 meters of cloth in eight hours, which is 250 meters more than the current ordinary weaving machine in Czechoslovakia. In addition, because it eliminates the spinning of warp yarn and related processes, it can greatly save manpower, machinery, and factory buildings. Therefore, the cost of cloth woven by this method is about 30 percent lower than that woven by ordinary weaving methods.

    Currently, the cloths successfully trial-produced in Czechoslovakia using this method include soft and light cloths for children and thick and strong cloths for making coats and jackets. These cloths are not only strong and soft, but also do not have the problem of becoming longer or shorter, and are very popular among wearers.

Hungary Discovers Many New Mineral Deposits
    Recently, Hungarian geological exploration teams have discovered many new mineral deposits. In the Matra Mountains in the north, lead-zinc mines have been discovered; near the village of Nadiborzsony north of Budapest, various non-metallic and metallic mineral deposits have been discovered; and in Borsod County in the northeast, potassium mines, an important raw material for artificial fertilizers, have been discovered. In addition, various geological exploration teams are further exploring the reserves of coal, iron, oil, bauxite, and natural gas in many areas in order to expand the existing mining base.

    苏联和人民民主国家的建设
    苏联农村电气化高度发展
    苏联农业展览会“农业机械化和电气化展览馆”的圆形大厅中，有一幅明光闪闪的苏联大地图，上面密密麻麻镶嵌着几千个彩色的电灯泡，每个电灯泡代表一个农村电力站。人们从地图上可以看出，大大小小的农村电力站不仅为苏联中部地区的农村供应电流，而且已经照亮了中亚细亚、西伯利亚、波罗的海沿岸、远东地区和北极圈内、偏僻的农村。
    讲解员举出的数字和事实具有巨大的说服力。在乌克兰，现在国营农场、全部机器拖拉机站和五千个集体农庄已经电气化了，分布在共和国各地的农村水电站的发电能力现在已经增加为一九四○年的三十倍。在乌兹别克，现在有四百二十多个集体农庄都建立了自己的电力站，单卡什卡—达里亚州沙赫里西布斯克区现在所有的电力站，就已经等于十月革命前全乌兹别克境内电力站的总数。和一九四○年相比，目前苏联全国集体农庄和国营农场的电力消耗量已经增为五倍以上。就电气化的发展速度说，苏联占世界第一位。
    苏联的农业电气化现在还在进一步发展着。
    苏联第一座宽银幕立体声电影院开幕
    第一座宽银幕立体声电影院——“艺术”电影院七月二十八日在莫斯科开幕。
    在普通电影院中，人们在银幕上只能看见街道、广场和风景等的一部分。在这个电影院中，银幕宽达十四公尺，大大扩大了放映范围。这种银幕是用特种塑胶制成，能使放映更加鲜明。
    除掉宽银幕而外，新电影院里还装置了特种设备，使观众听到声音是从左面、右面、他的身旁和银幕后的远处发出的。这是由于同时由四个录音带录音、而不是由一个录音带录音所致。扩音器现在不是只装在银幕的两旁，还装在银幕后面和剧场里。
    苏联正在改建和新建许多电影院，以便广泛放映宽银幕立体声电影。到明年，各加盟共和国首都和某些州中心将有五十家宽银幕电影院。目前正在筹备建筑二十座这种电影院，每一座可以容纳一千到三千人。若干部供宽银幕采用的纪录片和特制影片正在摄制中。
    朝鲜今年毕业生超过往年
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国今年有八千八百名学生从各高等学校和中等技术专科学校毕业，这个数目超过了过去每年毕业学生的数目。
    从高等学校毕业的二千多名学生中，大部分将参加工业建设工作和教育工作。五千多名中等技术专科学校的毕业生中，有百分之八十三将到各种工业部门工作，其他大部分将到农村经济部门。
    朝鲜高等教育和中等技术专科教育工作，在“八·一五”解放后的十年中有了迅速的发展。解放前，朝鲜北部连一所正规大学也没有，技术专科学校只有三所。现在全国有十七所大学和七十二所专科学校。十年来，这些学校已经为国家培养出三万二千七百多名各方面的建设人才。
    捷创造由棉片直接织布法
    捷克斯洛伐克布尔诺针织研究所的工作人员最近创造了一种新织布法，可以省去经纱纺纱过程，直接由棉片织成布匹。
    这种新织布法的工作过程是，首先使棉花经过普通清棉机做成棉卷，再经普通梳棉机彻底清除杂质。然后，不使它成为棉条去经过纺纱过程，而使它的纤维平行成为很细致的薄棉片，川流不息地直接进入新设计的针织机去织布。这种针织机上有上下两排带有纬纱的特制的针，机器开动后，这两排针就上下穿过棉片，用棉纱把棉片的纤维横着牢牢地扣钻起来，织成布匹。
    这种织布法因完全省去了经纱的纺纱过程，八小时可织三百公尺布，比目前捷克斯洛伐克普通织布机多二百五十公尺。此外，由于取消了经纱纺纱及连带过程，还可以大大节省人力、机器和厂房。因而用这种方法织成的布匹的成本比用普通织布法约减少百分之三十。
    目前捷克斯洛伐克利用这种方法试制成功的布匹有儿童用的轻软布匹和做外衣、夹克用的厚而结实的布匹。这些布匹不仅结实、轻软、而且没有变长和缩短的毛病，很受穿用者的欢迎。
    匈牙利发现许多新矿藏
    匈牙利地质探勘队最近发现许多新矿藏。在北部玛特拉山地区，发现了铅锌矿，在布达佩斯以北纳迪博尔索尼村附近发现了多种非金属和金属矿藏，在东北部包尔绍德州发现了人造肥料的重要原料——钾矿。此外，各个地质探勘队正在许多地区进一步勘察煤、铁、石油、铁矾土、天然瓦斯的蕴藏，以便扩大现有的采矿基地。　（据新华社讯）
