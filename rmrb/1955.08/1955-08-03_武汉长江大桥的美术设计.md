    The Art Design of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge
    Liao Bing
    The art design plan for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge has been selected by the State Council. This design plan illustrates a point: even the most magnificent projects can be both beautiful and practical and economical, and there is no insurmountable contradiction between beauty and practicality and economy.
    The Yangtze River Bridge is one of the great projects of China's socialist construction. The State Council's requirements for the Yangtze River Bridge are: it "should become an outstanding building"; "It should not only solve the country's huge economic problems at the modern technical level, but also mark China's new era with its majestic and magnificent appearance in terms of architectural art." For design staff, this task is arduous and very glorious.
    Last September, the Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau solicited art designs for the bridge from architecture departments of universities and design companies across the country, and received a total of eleven design plans. In March of this year, the Engineering Bureau hired a committee of experts to evaluate the various design plans. At that time, because the State Council had already made a decision on the construction of the waterborne part of the bridge, these plans focused on the design of the onshore part of the building—the bridgehead, the approach bridge, etc.
    Among the eleven design plans, they can be roughly divided into two types.
    One type is the majority of plans represented by the Central Design Institute's Plan No. 09-B. In this type of plan, the designers emphasized that the Yangtze River Bridge is a commemorative building and strived to build the bridgeheads on both sides as high and large as possible with very complex patterns. Originally, the upper-level highway bridge deck was already quite high, but the authors of Plan No. 09-B wanted to build a triumphal arch-style tower fifty meters high on the highway bridge deck of the bridgehead, seventy-five meters wide and forty meters long. There was a glittering golden top on the tower, and two carefully sculpted groups of statues behind the tower. Standing on the tower and looking down at the bridge, the cars became beetles! The approach bridge part designed in Plan No. 09-B requires building retaining walls more than 30 meters high from the fifth hole, so that the train has to pass through a dark artificial "tunnel" to cross the bridge. The high tower designed in Plan No. 09-A by the Central Design Institute is even more exaggerated, with a height of 97 meters; Plan No. 16 designed by the Beijing Design Institute actually arranged huge relief statues more than 20 meters above the ground outside the bridge, in places where people can hardly see them.
    What is the result of the art design represented by Plan No. 09? Only eight characters: difficult construction and expensive cost. The high towers they designed are equivalent to 20-story buildings. Such huge buildings have not yet been built in most parts of the country except Shanghai, so naturally they are not easy to construct. From an economic point of view, the cost of the bridgehead alone is equivalent to the cost of building two Han River Railway Bridges, which is twelve times higher than the cost of Plan No. 25 approved by the State Council. The cost of other similar plans is also about nine times higher than that of Plan No. 25. Are we building a bridge or a bridgehead? Many designers have not understood this issue. Is it true that spending more money means it will be more beautiful? Of course not. Plan No. 09-B made the huge bridgehead block the bridge's path, and the huge body of the high tower made the wide and majestic bridge look narrow and small, as if it wanted to compete with the bridge or suppress the bridge's majesty, destroying the overall style of the bridge, and "the guest overwhelms the host"!
    The other type is the art design represented by Plan No. 25 designed by young engineers Tang Huan-cheng and others from the Yangtze River Bridge Design Office. When designing this design plan, the authors considered the structure of the bridge itself as the main focus, while also considering economic rationality and technical feasibility. The bridgehead he designed is as high as the highway bridge deck; in addition, he built two pavilions with national characteristics on the bridge. These buildings have certain practical uses, such as stairs and elevators for pedestrians to go up and down the bridge are located inside the fort, and the two pavilions on the bridge are also used to cover the exit of the stairs. In order to distinguish the approach bridge from the main bridge in terms of volume and coordinate with each other, he adopted the Chinese national characteristic "pot bottom arch" method to build a high arch bridge type. The materials used are all lightweight, and prefabricated components and standardized designs are used as much as possible. Originally, using high-quality stone for facing can increase the beauty of the building, but this will increase the cost, so he decided to use only a few thin facings in places where pedestrians often come into contact, and use concrete natural color lines for the rest. The result of this design is that construction is relatively easy and the cost is relatively low. In terms of investment, it is only one-thirteenth of Plan No. 09-B. Does spending less money make the bridge unsightly? The opposite is true. The high arch bridge type and arch columns of the approach bridge of this plan echo the rhombic structure of the main bridge through the appropriately sized bridgehead, highlighting the majestic and magnificent appearance of the Yangtze River Bridge and giving people a broad-minded feeling. The designers also designed a bridgehead park for the city's people in the long-term plan, using the scenic spots and natural beauty of Qingchuan Pavilion and Lotus Lake in Hanyang and Snake Mountain in Wuchang to complement the magnificent bridge, creating an extremely beautiful environment.
    In this way, the State Council adopted the No. 25 art design plan. The State Council's selection of this design plan not only saved the country a large amount of funds, but more importantly, it threw a large amount of alum into the sewage pool of formalism in the architectural world, which is an effective measure to clarify various erroneous ideas.
    How to make architectural art serve China's construction is a question that all architectural workers must be concerned about. China is carrying out socialist construction. Because China's economy and technology are still backward, in order to give priority to the development of heavy industry, it is necessary to practice strict economy and concentrate human, financial, and material resources to ensure the victory of industrial construction. Architectural art cannot be separated from this policy. Whoever deviates from this most fundamental construction policy in design will inevitably fall into the quagmire of formalism and will waste a large amount of the country's precious construction funds. This simple principle is not understood by every design agency and every designer. The Yangtze River Bridge Art Design Evaluation Committee is a prominent example of not understanding this principle. During the evaluation in March of this year, many experts on the evaluation committee one-sidedly emphasized art design and believed that although economic issues should be considered, they were not the main ones. They simply emphasized that the bridgehead should be quite tall, and in order to achieve a beautiful outline, they emphasized that there must be a high tower in front of the bridge, but no one made an economic comparison. In this way, they did not consider saving money and listed Plan No. 09-A, which has a 97-meter-high tower, and Plan No. 16, which has huge reliefs that are difficult for people to see, as first-class, and Plan No. 09-B, which is the most expensive, as second-class, while Plan No. 25, which conforms to the principles of economy, practicality, and appropriate beauty, was listed as third-class. More seriously, they even criticized Plan No. 25 as "biased towards functionalism, although it conforms to economic principles, the artistic treatment is not enough." They later designed a comprehensive plan, which also has many flashy decorations such as high towers, corridors, and group statues, and its cost is still ten times that of Plan No. 25. This forced the State Council to reconsider their judgment and decided to adopt Plan No. 25.
    The approval of Plan No. 25 by the State Council gives another lesson to the architectural world: when accepting historical heritage, we should carefully study the original meaning and function of these heritages, otherwise we will blindly copy and imitate them and fall into the abyss of restorationism. As the name suggests, a bridgehead should be a "fortress at the head of a bridge." In ancient times, bridgeheads were defensive buildings. High fortress buildings at the head of the bridge would prevent the enemy from using the bridge over the river to attack themselves. In today's era of advanced science and technology, bridgeheads have almost completely lost their defensive function and only play the role of "dividing" and "connecting" the main bridge and the approach bridge in terms of architectural art. Therefore, modern bridges no longer build high bridgeheads. However, the authors of most of the art design plans for the Yangtze River Bridge did not carefully study the actual function of this building, so they did not critically imitate ancient buildings and blindly emphasized that the bridgehead should be high and large, and even build it into the clouds.
    Of course, Tang Huan-cheng, the author of Plan No. 25, was not very clear about these issues at first. His initial sketches were to build an eave arch between the two pavilions on the highway bridge deck. After seeing it, a Soviet expert said: "We must promote national forms, but we cannot restore the old." At the same time, he told him some important principles about architectural issues. This made him begin to pay attention to critically accepting historical heritage. The collective research of the engineers of the Yangtze River Bridge Design Office further helped him clarify that architecture must have its actual function and must seek beauty on the premise of practicality and economy. Also because this young engineer is modest in learning, loves the construction cause, does not seek to be different, is not nostalgic for the old, dares to create boldly, and adheres to the architectural principles pointed out by the Party and the government, he designed the current Plan No. 25. Now, he is continuing to study how to make the structure simpler and the decoration simpler in order to further reduce costs and save the country funds. (Attached picture)

    武汉长江大桥的美术设计
    廖冰
    武汉长江大桥的美术设计方案已经国务院选定。这个设计方案说明了一个问题：即使是最伟大的工程都可以在适用和经济的基础上作到美观，美观和适用、经济之间是没有不可克服的矛盾的。
    长江大桥是我国社会主义建设的伟大工程之一。国务院对长江大桥的要求是：它“应成为一个卓越的建筑”；“它不但应是现代的技术水平解决国家巨大的经济课题，而且在建筑艺术上能以雄伟壮丽的外观标志出中国的新时代。”对于设计工作人员说来，这个任务是艰巨的，也是十分光荣的。
    去年九月，长江大桥工程局向全国各大学建筑系、和各设计公司征求大桥的美术设计后，共收到十一个设计方案。今年三月，工程局聘请了专家组成委员会对各种设计方案进行评选。当时，由于国务院对大桥水上部分的建筑已经作了决定，所以这些方案都着重在岸上部分的建筑——桥头堡、引桥等的设计上。
    在十一个设计方案中，大约可分为两种类型。
    一种类型是以中央设计院的零九号乙方案为代表的大多数方案。在这类方案中，设计人员强调长江大桥是纪念性的建筑，力求把两岸的桥头堡筑得又高、又大，花式很复杂。本来，大桥上层的公路桥面已经相当高了，但零九号乙方案的作者还要在桥头堡的公路桥面上再建筑五十公尺高的凯旋门式的大塔，宽七十五公尺、长四十公尺。塔上有闪闪发光的辉煌的溜金顶，塔后有两座精心雕塑的群像。站在塔上俯视桥下，汽车都成了甲虫！零九号方案设计的引桥部分，从第五孔起就要筑起三十多公尺高的挡土墙，使火车不得不穿过一段黑黝黝的人工“隧道”才能跨上大桥。中央设计院设计的零九号甲方案所设计的高塔更虚夸，塔高是九十七公尺；北京设计院设计的十六号方案，竟在离地面二十多公尺高的桥外，在人们很难望到的地方布置了巨幅的浮雕像。
    以零九号方案为代表的美术设计的结果是什么呢？只有八个大字：施工困难，造价昂贵。他们设计的高塔相等于二十多层的楼房建筑，这样巨大的建筑除上海外全国各地都还没有过，自然是不容易施工的。从经济方面看，单是桥头堡的造价，即相当于修建两座汉水铁桥的费用，比经国务院批准的二十五号方案的造价高十二倍。其他类似的方案的造价也都比二十五号方案高九倍左右，我们究竟是修桥呢，还是建筑桥头堡呢？许多设计人员未弄明白这个问题。花钱多、是不是就很美观呢，当然不是。零九号乙方案使庞大的桥头堡截住了大桥的去路，高塔庞大的身躯将宽阔雄伟的大桥衬托得又窄又小，好像要同大桥分庭抗礼或要把大桥的威风压下去似的，破坏了大桥的整体风格，而且“喧宾夺主”了！
    另一种类型是以长江大桥设计事务所青年工程师唐寰澄等设计的二十五号方案为代表的美术设计。这个设计方案的作者在进行设计时，考虑到要以桥的本身结构为主，同时考虑到经济上的合理性和技术上的可能性。他所设计的桥头堡，同公路桥面一样高；另外，在桥上建有两个具有民族风格的亭屋。这些建筑都有一定的实际用途，如供行人上下桥梁用的楼梯、电梯都设在堡内，桥上的两个亭屋也是用来遮盖楼梯出口处的。为了使引桥在体量上同正桥有所区别而又互相配合，他采用了中国民族特有的“锅底券”的做法，建筑高连拱的桥式，所用的材料都是轻型的，并且尽量使用预制构件和定型设计。本来，用上等石料作镶面可以增加建筑物的美丽，但这样就要增高造价，他便决定只在行人经常接触的地方使用少数薄的镶面，其余都用混凝土本色画线条。这样设计的结果，施工比较容易、造价比较低廉，在投资方面看，只等于零九号乙方案的十三分之一。花钱比较少，是不是就使大桥不美观了呢？事实恰恰相反。这个方案的引桥的高连拱桥式和连拱立柱，通过体积适当的桥头堡，同正桥的菱格形结构遥相呼应，突出地表现出长江大桥的雄伟壮丽的外观，给人一种胸怀开扩的感觉；设计者还在远景计划中为城市人民设计了桥头公园，利用汉阳晴川阁、莲花湖和武昌蛇山的名胜古迹和自然美景，同雄伟的大桥相衬托，造成了一个极为优美的环境。
    这样，国务院便采用了二十五号美术设计方案。国务院选定了这个设计方案，不仅仅是为国家节省了大批资金，更重要的是向建筑界形式主义思想的污水池中投下了大量的明矾，是澄清各种错误思想的有效的措施。
    如何使建筑艺术为我国建设服务，是建筑界一切工作人员都必须关心的问题。我国正进行社会主义建设。由于我国的经济和技术还很落后，为了优先发展重工业，就必须要厉行节约，集中人力、财力、物力保证工业建设的胜利。建筑艺术是不能离开这个方针的，谁离开了这个最根本的建设方针进行设计，必然会坠入形式主义的泥坑，就会大量浪费国家宝贵的建设资金。这个浅明的道理，并不是每一个设计机关、每一个设计人员都懂得了，长江大桥美术设计评选委员会就是不懂得这个道理的一个突出的例子。在今年三月评选时，这个评选委员会的许多专家片面强调了美术设计，认为虽然要考虑经济问题，但不是主要的。他们单纯强调桥头堡要相当高大，为了轮廓线美，强调桥前一定要有高塔，却没有谁去作经济比较。这样，他们就不考虑节约，把具有九十七公尺高塔的零九号甲方案、具有为人们很难望到的巨幅浮雕的十六号方案列为甲等，把造价最贵的零九号乙方案列为乙等，而把符合经济、适用和适当美观原则的二十五号方案列为丙等；更严重的是竟批评二十五号方案是“偏向功能主义，虽合经济原则，但美术处理不够”。他们后来设计了一个综合方案，也有高塔、长廊、群像等许多浮华的装饰，其造价仍为二十五号方案的十倍。这就使国务院不得不重新考虑他们的评判，并且决定采用了二十五号方案。
    二十五号方案被国务院批准，它给建筑界的另一教训是在接受历史遗产时，应该认真研究这些遗产原来的意义和作用，否则就会盲目抄袭、模仿，陷入复古主义的深渊。顾名思义，桥头堡应是“桥头的堡垒”。在古代，桥头堡是防御性质的建筑。高大的堡垒建筑在桥头上，便可以使敌人不能利用河上的桥梁来攻击自己。在科学技术发达的今天，桥头堡几乎完全失去防御的作用，只在建筑艺术上起着“界分”和“联系”正桥和引桥的作用。因此，现代的桥梁都不再建筑高大的桥头堡了。但是，长江大桥多数美术设计方案的作者没有认真研究这个建筑的实际功用，结果就没有批判地模仿了古代建筑，一味强调桥头堡要高、要大，甚至要把它建立得矗入云霄。
    当然，二十五号方案的作者唐寰澄，最初对这些问题的认识并不是很明确的。他开始设计的草图是要在公路桥面两个亭屋间建立一道挑檐的拱门。苏联专家看了以后说：“要发扬民族形式，但不能复古。”同时告诉了他一些关于建筑问题的重要原则。这就使他开始注意要批判地接受历史遗产。长江大桥设计事务所的工程师们的集体研究，也进一步帮助他明确了建筑必须具有它的实际功用，要在适用和经济的前提下求得美观。还由于这个青年工程师虚心学习，热爱建设事业，不标新立异，对旧的东西不留恋，能大胆创造，坚持党和政府指出的建筑原则，他这才设计出了现时的二十五号方案。现在，他正继续研究怎样使结构简单些，装饰朴实些，以求更进一步降低造价，为国家节约资金。（附图片）
