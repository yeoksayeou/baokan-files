The National Private Commerce and Food Service Census Work Conference was recently held in Beijing under the direct leadership of the Fifth and Eighth Offices of the State Council. The conference was jointly convened by five units: the State Statistical Bureau, the Ministry of Commerce, the Central Administration for Industry and Commerce, the National Supply and Marketing Cooperative of China, and the General Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. Representatives from the aforementioned departments of various provinces, cities, and some prefectural and county-level cities, as well as representatives from relevant central units, attended the meeting.

The main task of the conference was to discuss and formulate a national census plan for private commerce and the food service industry and to make specific arrangements for this work.

The conference first pointed out that, in order to implement the Party and the People's Government's policy of socialist transformation of private commerce and the food service industry, and to provide a reliable basis for party and government leading organs at all levels to formulate specific arrangements, transformation plans, and steps, it is necessary to first understand the basic situation of private commerce and the food service industry clearly. However, the information on private commerce and the food service industry currently held by various regions and departments is far from meeting the needs of the current work. It is necessary to conduct a nationwide survey of the basic situation of private commerce and the food service industry in the second half of this year in order to obtain more complete and accurate data.

The conference believed that conducting such a large-scale census of private commerce and the food service industry involves a wide range of issues, and the work is quite arduous and complex. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the census work, the census items must be simple and clear, and the census methods must also be simple and easy to implement. The conference determined that the content of the census would include five items: the number of households, the number of employees and hired workers, the amount of capital, and the amount of income. The conference also studied the methods of obtaining data. The standard time for the national census was determined to be August 31, 1955. Many important issues directly related to this census were also specifically stipulated after detailed study by the conference.

The conference finally pointed out that this census is not only an arduous survey and statistical work, but also a major political task. Therefore, this work must be carried out jointly by all relevant business departments under the unified leadership of the party committees and people's committees at all levels. In order to ensure the successful completion of the census work, it is necessary to strengthen ideological leadership, do a good job in propaganda and mobilization, and explain the state's policies, the purpose and significance of this census, etc., to the vast number of private commercial and food service operators and shop employees, and eliminate their various ideological concerns. In addition, the staff participating in this census must be well trained. In the process of census and data aggregation, inspection and guidance should be strengthened, and data review and aggregation should be carried out carefully and meticulously. The conference emphasized that in order to ensure that the data of this census is true and reliable, it is necessary to fully mobilize the vast number of shop employees to actively participate.

    全国私营商业和饮食业普查工作会议在京举行
    制定全国私营商业和饮食业普查方案
    本报讯　在国务院第五和第八办公室的直接领导下，国家统计局、商业部、中央工商行政管理局、中华全国供销合作总社和财政部税务总局五单位，于最近在北京联合召开了全国私营商业和饮食业普查工作会议。出席这次会议的有各省、市和部分省辖市与县的上述各部门的代表以及中央各有关单位的代表。
    会议的主要任务是讨论并制定全国私营商业和饮食业普查方案，并具体布置这一工作。
    会议首先指出：为了贯彻党和人民政府对私营商业和饮食业进行社会主义改造的政策，提供各级党政领导机关制定具体安排、改造的计划和步骤的可靠依据，就必须首先将私营商业和饮食业的基本情况了解清楚。但是目前各地区各部门所掌握的私营商业和饮食业的资料，远不能满足当前工作的需要。必须于今年下半年在全国范围内普遍进行一次私营商业和饮食业基本情况的调查，以便取得比较完整和正确的资料。
    会议认为：进行这样大规模的私营商业和饮食业的普查工作，牵连很广，工作相当艰巨复杂，为使普查工作能顺利进行，普查的项目，必须简单明确；普查的方法，也必须简便易行。会议确定普查的内容为户数、从业人员及雇佣职工人数、资本额、收益额等五个项目。对资料取得的方法，会议也作了研究。关于全国普查的标准时间，确定为一九五五年八月三十一日。同这次普查有直接关系的许多重要问题，经过会议详细研究，也都作了具体规定。
    会议最后指出：这次普查不仅是一件繁重的调查统计工作，而且是一项重大的政治任务，因此这一工作必须在各级党委和人民委员会的统一领导下，组织各有关业务部门共同进行。为了保证普查工作胜利完成，必须加强思想领导，做好宣传动员工作，将国家的政策、这次普查的目的、意义等向广大的私营商业、饮食业者和店员职工讲解清楚，消除他们的各种思想顾虑。此外对参加这次普查的工作人员必须进行很好的训练。在普查以及资料汇总过程中，应加强检查、辅导工作，并认真地、仔细地进行资料审核和汇总工作。会议强调指出：为保证这次普查的资料真实可靠，必须充分发动广大店员职工积极参加。
