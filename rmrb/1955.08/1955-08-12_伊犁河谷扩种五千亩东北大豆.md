The Ili River Valley in Xinjiang Province has expanded its planting of Northeast "Man Cang Jin" soybeans by approximately 5,000 mu this year, exceeding the original plan by thirty-five percent. Currently, sowing has been completed. Farmers of all ethnic groups are carrying out irrigation and other field management work, striving for a bumper harvest.

The Ili River Valley in Xinjiang Province has long hours of sunshine, high temperatures, low humidity, and no significant pests and diseases, making it suitable for soybean growth. In 1953, the Ili River Experimental Farm conducted trial planting. In 1954, state-owned farms and some farmers trial-planted 1,200 mu, all of which yielded bumper harvests. After one year of planting, the quality of the soybean seeds has also improved.

    伊犁河谷扩种五千亩东北大豆
    新疆省伊犁河谷今年扩种了东北“满仓金”大豆约五千亩，超过原计划百分之三十五。目前，播种已全部结束。各族农民正在进行水利灌溉和其他田间管理工作，争取丰收。
    新疆省伊犁河谷日照长、气温高、湿度小，无显著病虫害，适合于大豆生长。一九五三年伊犁河试验农场曾进行了试种，一九五四年又有国营农场和部分农民试种了一千二百亩，都获得了丰收。经过种植一年的大豆种子，品质也有了改进。
