A batch of 6,100 graduates from 22 universities and secondary specialized schools in Tianjin have begun to participate in national construction work in batches. Some graduates from Tianjin Nursing School have already departed to work in Xinjiang. More than 170 secondary technical cadres trained by Tianjin Tractor Manufacturing School, the first batch of tractor manufacturing personnel in our country, are about to participate in the construction of the tractor manufacturing plant.

Among the more than 800 undergraduates in 15 majors at Tianjin University this year, 85.3 percent achieved excellent results in their graduation exams. This year, more than 1,000 graduates from Tianjin University and Nankai University also used their professional knowledge for the first time to complete graduation designs or graduation theses. Students majoring in power plant distribution networks and integrated transmission systems in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Tianjin University designed thermal power plants ranging from 12,000 kilowatts to 200,000 kilowatts, as well as 220,000-volt long-distance transmission lines and high-voltage regional networks.
