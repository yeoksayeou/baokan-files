    Don't Turn a Good Thing into a Bad One
    -- The Fushun Mining Bureau's Irresponsibility in the Construction of Self-Built, Publicly-Assisted Housing for Employees Has Led to Negative Consequences
    Editor's Note: Organizing employees to build dormitories through self-construction with public assistance is an effective measure to solve the housing problem for employees under the current conditions. To do this work well, on the one hand, we should strengthen the education of employees and mobilize them to actively use their own strength to solve their own problems; on the other hand, the leaders of industrial and mining enterprises need to conscientiously and responsibly assist in solving some difficulties in design and construction. According to readers' reflections, the Fushun Mining Bureau has adopted an irresponsible attitude towards this work, so that some of the dormitories built with self-construction and public assistance are of poor quality, and some are delayed in completion. Therefore, not only can the housing problem of employees not be solved, but the employees suffer undue losses. This is a noteworthy issue. In addition to the Fushun Mining Bureau quickly changing their wrong attitude and taking effective follow-up measures, other units that are building self-built, publicly-assisted employee housing should also learn from this lesson to prevent similar situations from occurring, so as not to turn good things into bad ones.
To the Editor:
    The construction quality of many "self-built, publicly-assisted employee residences" belonging to various factories and mines under the Fushun Mining Bureau is very poor. For example, at the Longfeng Mine construction site, several houses that were built one day collapsed the next morning; the houses that have not collapsed are also swaying, and people dare not approach them. Employees are worried: how can people live in such houses?
    Why did this happen? The main reason is that the relevant leading departments of the Fushun Mining Bureau lack a conscientious and responsible attitude towards the construction of "self-built, publicly-assisted employee residences." For example, Longfeng Mine blindly made adobe bricks without considering the seasonal conditions. As a result, more than 465,400 adobe bricks, except for a very small number that could be used reluctantly, most of them were soaked into a pile of mud by rain. The quality of adobe bricks in other factories and mines is also problematic: some are because the mud is not mixed evenly, and the middle still contains "soil surface"; some are made of sandy soil, and they break when touched by hand after drying. May I ask: how can you build a house with good quality with such adobe bricks? For example, Longfeng Mine believes that "self-built, publicly-assisted employee residences" are simple earthen bungalows, and there are no technical problems, so they are not carefully studied during design, resulting in errors in the design drawings, such as placing the beam ends on the doors and windows, and there are no top pillars in the middle of the fence wall.
    In addition, the "self-built, publicly-assisted employee residences" in some units cannot be completed on time due to lack of supervision during construction. For example, the Transportation Department rarely intervenes after contracting the "self-built, publicly-assisted employee residence" project to some temporary organized workers for 75 yuan per room, so that the houses that were originally planned to be completed at the end of July and could be lived in in August will now be delayed by at least two months. Therefore, employees have to pay rent for the houses they currently live in, and also have to pay deductions for "self-built, publicly-assisted employee residences."
    The relevant departments of the Fushun Mining Bureau's lack of attention to the construction of "self-built, publicly-assisted employee residences" has already caused bad results. They should quickly correct this wrong attitude and responsibly do a good job in the aftermath.

### 不要把好事办成坏事——抚顺矿务局对自建公助职工住宅修建工作不负责任造成了恶果

    不要把好事办成坏事
    ——抚顺矿务局对自建公助职工住宅修建工作不负责任造成了恶果
    编者按：组织职工用自建公助的办法兴建宿舍，这是在目前条件下解决职工住房问题的一项有效措施。要做好这项工作，一方面应该加强对职工的教育工作，发动他们积极地发挥自己的力量来解决自己的问题；另一方面还需要工矿领导方面认真负责地协助解决设计、施工等方面的一些困难。据读者反映，抚顺矿务局对这项工作采取了不负责任的态度，以致自建公助所修建的宿舍有的质量低劣，有的延期交工，因而不但不能解决职工的住房问题，反使职工受到不应有的损失。这是一个值得注意的问题。除了抚顺矿务局应该迅速改变他们的错误态度并采取有效的善后措施外，其它修建自建公助职工住宅的单位也应该接受这个教训，防止类似情况的出现，以免把好事办成了坏事。编辑同志：
    抚顺矿务局所属各厂矿的不少“自建公助职工住宅”，工程质量十分低劣。如龙凤矿工地上，头一天砌好的房子，第二天早晨就倒了好几座；还没有倒的房子也摇摇晃晃，人们不敢走近它们。职工们都在发愁：这样的房子怎么能够住人呢？
    为什么会出现这样的情况呢？主要是由于抚顺矿务局的有关领导部门对于修建“自建公助职工住宅”缺乏认真负责的态度。例如，龙凤矿不考虑季节情况就盲目做土坯子，结果四十六万五千四百多块土坯子除极少数能凑合使用外，绝大部分都被雨水淋成一堆烂泥。其它厂矿的土坯子质量也有问题：有的因为泥没有合匀，中间还含有“土面子”；有的是用砂土做的，干了以后用手一碰就碎了。试问：用这样的土坯子怎么能够盖出质量不坏的房子来呢？又如龙凤矿认为“自建公助职工住宅”是简易的土造平房，不存在什么技术问题，因而设计时不加慎重研究，结果在设计图纸中闹出了把房梁头放在门、窗口上和栅墙中间没有顶梁柱子的错误。
    另外，有些单位的“自建公助职工住宅”，因为施工中缺乏监督而不能按期完工。例如，运输部把“自建公助职工住宅”工程以七十五元一间包给一些临时组织起来的工人以后就很少过问，以致原计划在七月末交工、八月就可住人的房子，现在至少也得拖延两个月才能完工。因此，职工一面对现在住的房屋要付房租费，一面又得付“自建公助职工住宅”的扣款。
    抚顺矿务局有关部门不重视修建“自建公助职工住宅”的工作，已经造成了不好的结果。他们应该迅速纠正这种错误态度，并且负责地做好善后工作。抚顺矿务局一工人
