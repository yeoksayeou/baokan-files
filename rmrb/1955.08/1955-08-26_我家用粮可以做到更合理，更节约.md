Title: My Family Can Use Grain More Rationally and Economically

The State Council has announced the "Provisional Measures for Rationed Grain Supply in Cities and Towns." Based on my personal experience, I believe that these measures are in line with the actual situation in cities and towns and are correct. Therefore, I firmly support these measures. Where is my basis? It can be proved from the specific facts of my family.

I am a resident of Changsha City. My family has six people, five adults and one child. The family's life is maintained by my second son's stall business. The monthly income is at most 30 yuan. Before Changsha implemented verified grain supply, the family did not have a plan for monthly grain consumption, buying as much as they ate, consuming 190 to 200 catties of grain per month. More than two-thirds of the monthly income had to be spent on purchasing grain, and the family's money was often not enough, and they had to borrow some money from others to make ends meet.

In June of this year, Changsha City implemented verified grain supply. My family made careful calculations and drew up a grain consumption plan, which can save 60 to 70 catties of grain and save 6 to 7 yuan per month, and the family's life is also more comfortable. In the past, it was quite difficult to eat a catty of oil and meat a month, or to make clothes for adults and children. Now, we can eat one or two catties of oil and meat every month, and we can also make a set of new clothes for adults and children. With a plan for monthly grain consumption, life is also easier to arrange, and money is also planned accordingly. My family no longer borrows money from others, and one month's income is enough. From June to August, my family did not borrow a penny from anyone. My second son used to earn money without any idea, but now he has a clear idea. Therefore, I deeply feel that the government's implementation of verified grain supply has many advantages.

When drawing up the grain consumption plan for July, my second daughter-in-law did not understand. She was afraid of not having enough to eat, and thought that the government was grasping the grain so "tightly" because the Dongting Lake area suffered a flood last year and there was not enough grain. She insisted on ordering 175 catties, not a bit less. I am a neighborhood women's committee member. After returning from a report in the district, I understood the principle of verified grain supply. At the family meeting to draw up the grain plan, I said: "The government's implementation of verified grain supply is to save grain and to ensure that we can eat enough. Last year, the Dongting Lake area suffered such a big flood. Thanks to the government's implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain, which controlled sufficient grain, the grain supply in Changsha City has never been insufficient, and the grain price has not risen at all." She said, "Every grain is eaten in the stomach, what is there to waste?" I said, "There is waste. Our rice is cooked too hard. One catty of rice only cooks two catties of rice. If we improve the method of cooking rice and increase the rice yield, we will definitely save grain." She couldn't say anything to object to my words, so she had to say: "Okay! You order as much as you want, it's up to you. Anyway, the government won't let us starve. If we don't have enough to eat, we'll go buy it." Finally, my family set the grain consumption plan for July at 150 catties, and this plan was approved by the police station.

Now that the plan has been made, I want to convince my second daughter-in-law that my words are correct, and I began to study the method of cooking rice. I heard people say that steaming the rice after simmering it not only increases the rice yield, but also is easier to digest. I think this method is very simple, so I tried it. The first day, I weighed four and a half catties of rice to cook, and then weighed it again. On average, each catty of rice yielded three catties and twelve taels of rice. The rice grains were not hard or mushy, and the whole family of six people ate their fill and felt very comfortable in their stomachs. Due to the increased rice yield, my family only ate 136 catties in July, saving 14 catties. When drawing up the plan for August, I thought that we could reduce it by another six catties, so I only ordered 130 catties, saving six catties. My second daughter-in-law saw that the whole family was full, and that we saved six or seven yuan every month, and she was very satisfied. She said: "We should believe in the methods of the Communist Party and the People's Government."

After the implementation of the grain rationed supply method, I believe that my family's grain consumption can be more rational and economical, and we can arrange family life in a more planned way, which is also more conducive to the country's economic construction.

### 我家用粮可以做到更合理，更节约

　　我家用粮可以做到更合理，更节约
　　庄淑仪
    国务院公布了“市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”。根据我的切身经验，我认为这个办法是切合市镇实际情况的，是正确的。因此，我坚决服从这个办法。我的根据在哪儿呢？从我家的具体事实就可以得到证明。
    我是长沙市的居民，我家有六口人，五个大人，一个小孩。一家人的生活，由我二儿子做小摊贩生意来维持。每月的收入最多不过三十元。在长沙市没有实行粮食核实供应前，家里每月用粮没有个计划，吃多少买多少，一个月要吃一百九十斤至两百斤粮食。每月收入的三分之二以上要花在购买粮食上，家里的钱经常不够用，多少要向别人借些钱才能周转得过来。
    今年六月，长沙市实行了粮食核实供应，我家精打细算，订出了用粮计划，每月能节约粮食六、七十斤，少花六、七块钱，家里生活也显得宽裕了。过去一个月要想吃斤把油、肉，或是要想给大人和小孩添制点衣服都相当困难。现在每月能吃上一、二斤油、肉，还可以给大人和小孩制套把新衣。每月用粮有了计划，生活也好安排，用钱也跟着有计划了。我家不再向别人借钱，一个月的收入也就够了。从六月到八月，我家一文钱也没有向人借过。我二儿子过去挣钱，心里总没有个底，现在也心中有数了。因此，我深深感到政府实行粮食核实供应，好处实在是很多。
    订七月份用粮计划时，我的二媳妇思想不通，她怕吃不饱饭，认为政府把粮抓这样“紧”，是不是因为去年洞庭湖地区遭了水灾，粮食不够了。她坚持要订一百七十五斤，一点也不能少。我是街道妇女委员，从区上听报告回来，我懂得粮食核实供应的道理，在订粮食计划的家庭会议上，我说：“政府实行粮食核实供应，是要我们节约粮食，又要我们能吃饱饭。去年洞庭湖地区遭了那样大的水灾，由于政府实行了粮食统购统销，掌握了足够的粮食，长沙市粮食供应始终没有不够，粮价一点也没涨。”她说：“每颗粮食都吃在肚子里去了，有什么浪费的。”我说：“浪费是有的，我们的饭煮得太硬，一斤米才煮两斤饭，如果改进煮饭方法，提高出饭率，一定会节约出粮食来的。”她说不出什么道理来反对我的话，只好说：“那好吧！你订多少算多少，由你的便，反正政府是不会让我们饿饭的，吃不饱了再去买。”最后，我家把七月份用粮计划订为一百五十斤，这个计划被派出所批准了。
    计划订出来了，我要使我的二媳妇相信我的话是正确的，我开始研究煮饭方法。我听到人家说，把米先焖后蒸，不但出饭率高，而且比较容易消化，我想这个方法很简单，试试看。第一天，我用秤称了四斤半米来煮，然后再秤，平均每斤米出了三斤十二两饭，饭粒不硬不烂，全家六口人，吃得饱饱的，胃里感到很舒服。由于提高了出饭率，七月份我家只吃了一百三十六斤，节约下来十四斤。八月份订计划时，我认为还可以减少六斤，只订一百三十斤，节约了六斤。我的二媳妇看到全家人都吃饱了饭，每月又节余出六、七块钱来，她也很满意。她说：“应该相信共产党和人民政府的办法。”
    实行粮食定量供应办法后，我相信我家的用粮可以做到更合理，更节约，并可以更有计划地安排家庭生活，同时更有利于国家的经济建设。
