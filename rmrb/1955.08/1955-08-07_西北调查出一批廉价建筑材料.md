Xinhua News Agency report:

    The Northwest Industrial Building Design Institute recently surveyed over 200 types of building materials that can reduce project costs, and plans to widely adopt them in future building designs.

    In its survey, the Northwest Industrial Building Design Institute discovered a large amount of dry sand near Xi'an, with strength and performance fully meeting technical requirements. Using this dry sand to replace water sand, which was previously dredged from rivers dozens of miles away, can save approximately 60% of the transportation costs per cubic meter of sand. Xi'an also produces natural pebbles, and using these pebbles instead of crushed stone as concrete material can reduce the cost by more than 13,000 yuan per 10,000 square meters of building area. They also discovered many industrial and agricultural by-products that can be used as building materials. For example, bricks made from wood shavings and clay are lightweight, cold-proof, and heat-insulating, and can replace expensive foam concrete for roofing. In the past, hemp fiber plaster was used as the base coat for plastering walls and ceilings. Now, if wheat straw mud is used as the base coat, the cost per 10,000 square meters of building area can be reduced by more than 16,000 yuan, while ensuring a certain level of quality. Cotton stalks, corn stalks, rice stalks, sunflower stalks, and many other agricultural by-products can be used for ceilings, partition walls, etc., according to research.

    西北调查出一批廉价建筑材料
    西北工业建筑设计院最近调查出二百多样能降低工程造价的建筑材料，准备今后在建筑设计中广泛采用。
    西北工业建筑设计院在调查中发现西安市附近有大量旱砂，它的强度和性能完全符合技术要求。用这种旱砂代替过去从几十里外的河内打捞的水砂，每立方砂子可节省运费百分之六十左右。西安市附近还出产天然卵石，用它代替碎石做混凝土材料，每万平方公尺建筑面积的造价，可降低一万三千多元。他们还发现不少工业、农业的副产品，可作建筑材料。如利用木屑和黏土制成的砖，重量很轻，能防寒、隔热，可以代替价钱很贵的泡沫混凝土作屋顶用。过去粉刷墙面和天棚，都是用麻刀灰打底，现在若用麦草泥打底，每万平方公尺建筑面积的造价，可降低一万六千多元，并能保证一定的质量。棉花秆、玉米秆、稻秆、向日葵秆等很多农副业产品，经研究认为都可以作天棚、隔墙等用。
