Soviet Union's Flax Fiber Production Ranks First in the World

    Soviet flax production is developing rapidly, and flax fiber production now ranks first in the world.
    Flax cultivation has a long history in the Soviet Union. However, the rapid development of flax cultivation has occurred only in the last thirty years. During the Soviet era, the area where this important industrial raw material crop is produced has greatly expanded. This year alone, the sown area has increased by approximately 360,000 hectares compared to last year. The unit area yield of Soviet flax is also very high. Last year, many areas harvested 6 to 8 quintals of flax fiber per hectare on large fields, and in some cases, even up to 12 quintals. To improve flax varieties, the Soviet Union has now established 132 breeding stations dedicated to breeding and promoting improved varieties. Last year, about 90 percent of the flax land was sown with superior varieties.
    The degree of mechanization in Soviet flax production is increasing year by year. Now, a large number of flax narrow-row seeders, flax harvesting combines, scutching machines, threshing machines, and many other machines and farm implements are working for collective farms and state farms.

Vietnamese Workers Actively Propose Rationalization Suggestions

    According to the Vietnamese "People's Daily," in the first half of this year, Vietnamese workers and laborers have put forward 4,521 rationalization proposals, saving the state raw materials worth 17,788.8 million Vietnamese dong, while also saving 87,770 working days.
    Although the French troops dismantled and destroyed a large number of machines and appliances when they withdrew from Hanoi, Haiphong, and the Hong Gai mining area, the workers overcame the difficulties caused by the enemy and enabled production to recover rapidly. For example, Du Xuan Yan and Wu Wenqing of the Gia Lam locomotive repair factory manufactured welding materials, Nguyen Duc Van of the An Phu power plant manufactured refractory bricks, and Mei Zhonggang used old materials to make some machine parts. These creations solved the needs of production and saved the country a large amount of foreign exchange.

Poland Produces a Car Every Twelve Minutes

    Poland's automobile manufacturing industry and road transportation have developed greatly during the Six-Year Plan (1950-1955).
    In 1938, Poland had only 11 cars for every 10,000 residents on average. In 1954, there were 77 cars per 10,000 people. Before the implementation of the Six-Year Plan, Poland did not have an automobile industry. With the full assistance of the Soviet Union, People's Poland has built an automobile industry with the latest machinery and technical equipment during the Six-Year Plan. Poland already has two truck manufacturing plants and one light vehicle manufacturing plant. Poland's automobile manufacturing plants are currently able to produce an average of one truck every twelve minutes and one moped every five minutes.
    Now, the number of trucks in Poland has increased more than tenfold compared to 1938, and the proportion of road freight in the total national freight volume has increased from 8.4 percent in 1952 to 16.5 percent.

Romanian Provinces are Intensively Harvesting

    Harvesting is in full swing in the fields of Romania. So far, grain has been harvested on more than 80 percent of the total area.
    This year, although the grain ripening period in Romania was five to seven days later than last year due to climatic conditions, the harvesting work was about three days faster than last year. Many state farms and collective farms harvested an average of more than 4,000 kilograms of barley per hectare (one hectare equals fifteen mu) and an average of 3,000 kilograms of wheat per hectare. Individual farmers also obtained considerable yields.
    In addition to harvesting grain, agricultural workers in various places are also harvesting large quantities of potatoes, early-maturing vegetables, and feed. According to agricultural experts and proficient farmers, Romania's corn, sunflowers, sugar beets, as well as table grapes and wine grapes will have the best harvest in the past twenty years.

Bulgaria's Foreign Trade Continues to Expand

    In 1937, the trade volume between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Albania accounted for only 12 percent of Bulgaria's foreign trade. In 1954, it had reached 74.6 percent.
    Now, the Soviet Union provides Bulgaria annually with a considerable portion of the necessary machinery and equipment, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, petroleum, petroleum products, and other goods. At the same time, Bulgarian goods have also found a reliable and stable market in the Soviet Union. Bulgaria exports industrial and agricultural raw materials and consumer goods to the Soviet Union every year.
    The exchange of goods between Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria occupies an important position in Bulgaria's foreign trade. It supplies Bulgaria with goods such as: electrical equipment, spare parts, tractors and trucks, aniline dyes, pulp, paper, and medicines.
    Trade between Bulgaria and the German Democratic Republic has greatly developed in recent years.
    Bulgaria's trade with the People's Republic of China, Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Albania is also constantly expanding. China exports tin, asbestos, and rubber to Bulgaria, while Bulgaria exports machinery and chemical fertilizers to China.
    Due to Bulgaria's constantly expanding trade links with countries in the democratic camp, Bulgaria's export and import volumes in 1954 increased by 28 and 16 percent respectively compared to 1952.

    苏联和人民民主国家的建设
    苏联亚麻纤维生产占世界第一
    苏联亚麻的生产发展很快，亚麻纤维产量现在已经占世界第一位。
    从很古的时候起，在苏联的土地上就开始种植亚麻。但是，亚麻种植业的迅速发展还是最近三十多年的事。在苏维埃政权的年代中，苏联出产这种重要工业原料作物的地区大大扩大了，单是今年播种面积就比去年约增加了三十六万公顷。苏联亚麻的单位面积产量也很高。去年，许多地方在大片田地上每公顷收获了六公担到八公担的亚麻纤维，最多的甚至达到十二公担。为了改良亚麻品种，苏联现在已经设立了一百三十二个育种站专门进行育种和推广良种的工作。去年，约有百分之九十的亚麻地都是用优良品种播种的。
    在苏联亚麻生产的机械化程度年年都在提高。现在，有大量亚麻窄行播种机、亚麻收割联合机、剥麻机和脱粒机以及许多其他机器和农具为集体农庄和国营农场工作。 
    越南工人积极提出合理化建议
    据越南“人民报”报道，今年上半年，越南工人和劳动人民已经提出四千五百二十一件合理化建议，为国家节省的原材料值一百七十七亿八千八百万元越币，同时还节省了八万七千七百七十个工作日。
    虽然法军在撤出河内、海防和鸿基矿区时，拆走和破坏了大批机器和用具。但是工人们克服了敌人所造成的困难，使生产得以迅速恢复。例如嘉林机车修理厂工人杜春言、武文清制造了电焊材料，安富电厂工人阮德文制造了耐火砖、工人梅忠刚还利用旧材料制成了一部分机器零件，这些创造都解决了生产上的需要，并且为国家节省了大批外汇。
    波兰每十二分钟出产一辆汽车
    波兰汽车制造工业和公路运输在六年计划（一九五○—一九五五年）期间有了很大发展。
    一九三八年，波兰平均每一万居民中只有十一辆汽车，一九五四年每万人中已有七十七辆。六年计划开始实施前，波兰还没有汽车工业。在苏联的全面帮助下，人民波兰在六年计划期间已建设起来了拥有最新机器和技术装备的汽车工业。波兰已经有两个载重汽车制造厂和一个轻便汽车制造厂，波兰的汽车制造厂目前已经能够平均每十二分钟出产一辆载重汽车，每五分钟出产一辆双轮摩托车。
    现在，波兰的载重汽车增为一九三八年的十倍多，公路货运量在国家全部货运量中所占的比重已由一九五二年的百分之八点四增加为百分之十六点五。
    罗马尼亚各州紧张进行夏收
    罗马尼亚的田地上正在紧张地进行夏收。到目前为止，占总面积百分之八十以上的土地上的谷物已经收割完毕。
    今年，罗马尼亚虽然由于气候条件，谷物的成熟期比去年晚了五天到七天，但是收割工作却比去年快三天左右。许多国营农场和集体农庄的每公顷（一公顷合十五市亩）大麦平均收获四千多公斤，每公顷小麦平均收获三千公斤。个体农民也得到了相当高的产量。
    除了收割谷物而外，各地农业劳动者也正在收获大量的马铃薯、早熟蔬菜和饲料。根据农业专家和丰产能手的估计，今年罗马尼亚的玉蜀黍、向日葵、甜菜以及食用葡萄和酿酒葡萄将得到过去二十年来未见过的大丰收。
    保加利亚对外贸易不断扩大
    在一九三七年，保加利亚同苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚和阿尔巴尼亚的贸易数量，总共只占保加利亚对外贸易量的百分之十二，而在一九五四年，已经达到了百分之七十四点六。
    现在，苏联每年都供给保加利亚以相当大部分的必要的机器和设备，黑色金属和有色金属，石油、石油产品，以及其他货品。同时，保加利亚的货品也在苏联获得了一个可靠和稳定的市场，保加利亚每年向苏联输出工业和农业原料以及消费品。
    捷克斯洛伐克同保加利亚的货物交换在保加利亚的对外贸易中占据着一个重要的地位，它供给保加利亚的货物有：电力装备、备件、拖拉机和载重汽车、苯胺颜料、纸浆、纸张和药品等。
    保加利亚同德意志民主共和国的贸易在最近几年中有很大发展。
    保加利亚同中华人民共和国、波兰、匈牙利、罗马尼亚和阿尔巴尼亚的贸易也在不断扩大中。中国向保加利亚输出锡、石棉和橡胶，保加利亚向中国输出机器和化学肥料。
    由于保加利亚同民主阵营各国不断扩大贸易联系，一九五四年保加利亚的输出和输入量，就分别比一九五二年增加了百分之二十八和十六。
