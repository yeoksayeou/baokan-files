Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 24th: Lao sources report that the Lao Kingdom government army has recently continued to attack Lao fighting units in Sam Neua province.

　　On August 17th, the Kingdom government army stationed in Ba Kha, Sam Neua province, launched an attack on Lao fighting units around Ba Kha. Under the fierce resistance of the Lao fighting units, the Kingdom government army suffered significant losses and retreated to Ba Kha.

　　On August 19th, the Kingdom government army again dispatched troops from Ba Thi, attacking the Lao fighting units' residence in Hoi Ya. After an hour of combat, the Kingdom government army had no choice but to retreat due to the unsuccessful attack. On the same day, the Kingdom government army also attacked Phu Xang.

　　Meanwhile, on August 20th, the Kingdom government army launched an attack on Lao fighting units around Hoi Teu, southwest of Sam Neua, attempting to expand its occupied area, but failed to achieve its objective.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 22nd: According to "Lao News," the Lao Kingdom government political delegation wrote to the Lao fighting units' political delegation on August 10th, rejecting the reasonable proposal on general elections put forward by the Lao fighting units' delegation at the political conference.

　　At the political conference in late July, the Lao fighting units' delegation pointed out that many clauses of the election law drafted by the Kingdom government in 1951 were undemocratic and inconsistent with the spirit of the Geneva Accords. The Lao fighting units' delegation also suggested supplementing some clauses of the election law to make it consistent with the spirit of the Geneva Accords and the current situation in Laos. For example, it was suggested to allow women to participate in the general election, reduce the restrictions on candidates' qualifications, and establish joint committees at all levels with representatives from the Kingdom government, the Lao fighting units, and other political parties to be responsible for the organization and supervision of the general election.

　　However, the Kingdom government's response to the above reasonable suggestions was to reject any of them.

　　"Lao News" finally pointed out that the letter of August 10th shows that the intention of the ruling authorities in the Kingdom government is to exclude Lao resistance personnel and all patriotic citizens from the general election to be held in December this year.

　　老挝王国军队继续进攻寮国战斗部队
　　老挝王国政府无理拒绝寮国战斗部队关于普选的建议
    新华社河内二十四日电　老挝消息：老挝王国政府军队近日仍在连续进攻桑怒省的寮国战斗部队。
    八月十七日，驻扎在桑怒省巴卡的王国政府军队向巴卡周围地区的寮国战斗部队发动进攻。在寮国战斗部队猛烈的抵抗下，王国政府军队遭到重大损失后撤回巴卡。
    八月十九日，王国政府军队又从巴梯出动，进攻了寮国战斗部队驻地会雅。战斗达一小时，由于进攻无结果，王国政府军队只好撤回。同一天，王国政府军队还进攻了富赞。
    同时，王国政府军队在八月二十日又向桑怒西南的会头周围地区的寮国战斗部队发动进攻，企图扩展它的占领区，但是没有达到目的。
    新华社河内二十二日电　据“寮国新闻”报道，老挝王国政府政治代表团八月十日写信给寮国战斗部队政治代表团，拒绝了寮国战斗部队代表团在政治会议上提出的有关普选的合理建议。
    在七月下旬的政治会议上，寮国战斗部队代表团曾提出，王国政府一九五一年拟订的选举法有许多条款是不民主和不符合日内瓦协定的精神的。寮国战斗部队代表团并且建议补充选举法的一些条款，使它符合于日内瓦协议的精神和符合于老挝目前的情势。例如，建议准许妇女参加普选，减少限制候选人的条件，成立有王国政府和寮国战斗部队以及其他政党的代表参加的各级联合委员会以负责普选的组织和监察等。
    但是，王国政府对上述合理建议的答复是不采纳其中任何一点。
      “寮国新闻”最后指出，八月十日的信件表明了王国政府中的执政者的意图是要把寮国抗战人员以及一切爱国公民排除在即将在今年十二月举行的普选之外。
