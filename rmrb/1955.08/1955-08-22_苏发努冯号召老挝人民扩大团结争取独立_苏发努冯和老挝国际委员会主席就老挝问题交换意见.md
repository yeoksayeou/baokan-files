Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 21st: Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the Lao Fighting Forces, issued a call to the nation on August 13th.

The call first recalled that five years ago, on August 13th, the Lao people held the People's Congress of Free Laos. At the meeting, the line and policy of the Lao people's struggle were decided, the Lao Free National United Front was established, and the Central Executive Committee of the Lao Resistance Government and the Lao Free National United Front was elected. Since then, the national people's resistance has developed rapidly and continuously achieved victories. The most significant and glorious victory was the signing of the Geneva Accords, which recognized the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia, enabling the cessation of war and the restoration of peace.

The call stated that the Lao Fighting Forces correctly implemented the armistice agreement, completed the concentration of troops, and consistently and sincerely held political conferences with the Royal Government side for the sake of unifying the motherland. The call then pointed out that, on the contrary, the Royal Government side, in accordance with the orders of US imperialism, continuously violated the agreement, sending more troops to continuously attack and occupy the assembly areas of the Lao Fighting Forces. At the same time, they used every method to interrupt the political conferences and conspired to carry out unilateral elections without the participation of the Lao Fighting Forces.

The call continued to point out that, obviously, the policy of the Royal Government side is to negotiate on the one hand and attack on the other. Even more dangerous is that US imperialism and these running dogs are preparing to sign a US-Laos military agreement in order to drag Laos into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, plotting to turn beloved Laos into a colony and war-making base of US imperialism.

The call called on the people of Laos to consolidate and expand national unity, oppose the vicious conspiracies of US imperialism and its running dogs, to consolidate peace, realize democracy, unification, and complete the national independence of Laos.

The call also demanded that the Royal Government conduct sincere negotiations with the Lao Fighting Forces on the principles of equality, mutual understanding, and mutual compromise, guarantee and proclaim the people's democratic and free rights, and conduct free elections throughout the country with the participation of the Lao Fighting Forces and those who had previously participated in the war of resistance.

The call stated: We must strengthen solidarity with the people of the two neighboring countries, Vietnam and Cambodia, with the people of Southeast Asian countries, with the French people, and with the peace-loving people of the world.

The call concluded by saying that, because of the righteousness of the Lao people's struggle, the unity of the national people, and the enthusiastic support of the peace-loving people of the world, the cause of the Lao people's struggle for peace, democracy, unification, and independence, although it is still long-term and arduous, will surely achieve glorious victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 20th: According to "Lao News," the Chairman of the International Commission for Laos, Mr. S. Sain, met with Prince Souphanouvong, the leader of the Lao Fighting Forces, in Sam Neua, the capital of Sam Neua Province, on August 13th. Prince Souphanouvong and Sain exchanged views on the Lao question.

The people and local authorities of the capital of Sam Neua Province and the surrounding areas warmly welcomed the Chairman of the International Commission for Laos and expressed to him their desire for the Royal side to correctly implement the Geneva Accords.

　　苏发努冯号召老挝人民扩大团结争取独立
　　苏发努冯和老挝国际委员会主席就老挝问题交换意见
    新华社河内二十一日电　寮国战斗部队领袖苏发努冯亲王在八月十三日向全国人民发表了号召书。
    号召书首先追述说，五年前的八月十三日这一天，老挝人民举行了自由寮国人民代表大会。会上，决定了老挝人民的斗争路线和政策，成立了寮国自由民族统一战线，并且选出了寮国抗战政府和寮国自由民族统一战线中央执行委员会。从此，全国人民的抗战日益迅速发展和不断取得胜利。最重大、最光荣的胜利就是日内瓦协定的签订，它使老挝和越南、柬埔寨的独立主权和领土完整得到承认，战争得以停止，和平得以恢复。
    号召书说，寮国战斗部队正确执行了停战协定，完成了军队的集结，并且为了统一祖国而一贯真诚地和王国政府方面举行了政治会议。号召书接着指出，相反地，王国政府方面却按照美帝国主义的命令不断违反协定，增派军队连续进攻和侵占寮国战斗部队的集结区。同时，利用一切方法使政治会议中断，并且阴谋进行没有寮国战斗部队参加的片面普选。
    号召书继续指出，显然，王国政府方面的政策就是一面进行协商，一面进行进攻。更加危险的是，美帝国主义和这些走狗们又正在准备签订美国—老挝军事协定，以便将老挝拉入东南亚侵略集团，阴谋将可爱的老挝变为美帝国主义的殖民地和制造战争的基地。
    号召书号召老挝全国人民巩固和扩大全民的团结，反对美帝国主义及其走狗的恶毒阴谋，以巩固和平、实现民主、统一和完成老挝的民族独立。
    号召书还要求王国政府在双方平等、互相谅解、互相让步的原则上同寮国战斗部队进行真诚的谈判，保障和宣布人民的民主自由权利，在全国内进行有寮国战斗部队和以前参加过抗战的人们所参加的自由普选。
    号召书说：我们要与两个邻近国家越南和柬埔寨的人民，与东南亚各国人民，与法国人民和世界爱好和平人民加紧团结。
    号召书最后说，由于老挝人民斗争的正义性、全国人民的团结和全世界爱好和平人民的热烈支持，老挝人民为和平、民主、统一、独立而斗争的事业虽然还是长期、艰苦的，但是一定会获得光辉的胜利。
    新华社河内二十日电　据“寮国新闻”消息，老挝国际委员会主席斯·塞恩在八月十三日到桑怒省省会桑怒和寮国战斗部队的领袖苏发努冯亲王会面。苏发努冯亲王和塞恩就老挝问题交换了意见。
    桑怒省会和周围地区人民以及地方当局热情地欢迎老挝国际委员会主席，并且向他表示了要求王国方面正确地执行日内瓦协定的愿望。
