　　Fixed Survey Completed for Qingshui to Yumen Section of Railway
    The fixed survey work for the 141-kilometer line of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway from Qingshui to the Yumen Oil Mine has been basically completed, creating favorable conditions for opening the line to the Yumen Oil Mine next year.
    The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway from Qingshui to the Yumen Oil Mine needs to cross the more than six-kilometer-wide Hongshui River and large areas of sand dunes, and the terrain and geological conditions are very complex. The surveying and mapping personnel responsible for surveying this section of the line have climbed over the sand dunes several times and conducted on-site investigations along the Hongshui River, surveying three comparison lines, and finally determined a line. This line is located in a place where the Hongshui River is narrower and there are fewer sand dunes, and the terrain is relatively flat, so it can not only shorten the length of the Hongshui River Bridge and reduce the number of protection projects in desert areas, but also save the construction costs of two stations. It is estimated that the project investment required for the preliminary design can be saved by more than four million yuan.

### 清水到玉门段铁路定测完成

　　清水到玉门段铁路定测完成
    兰新铁路从清水到玉门油矿的一百四十一公里线路的定测工作已经基本完成，为明年通车玉门油矿创造了有利的条件。
    兰新铁路从清水到玉门油矿，要跨过六公里多宽的洪水河和大片的沙丘，地形和地质情况都很复杂。担任勘测这段线路的勘测人员，曾几次爬越沙丘，沿着洪水河进行了实地调查，勘测了三条比较线，最后才确定了一条线路。这条线路位置在洪水河较窄和沙丘较少的地方，地势也较平坦，因此不但可以缩短洪水河大桥的长度，减少沙漠地区的防护工程数量，还可以省去两个车站的建筑费，估计可以比初步设计所需的工程投资节省四百万元以上。
