　 Three Cooperatives including Changshan Jointly Establish Livestock Farm

　　The Changshan, Changshui, and Changxin agricultural production cooperatives in Changshi Township, Dading County, Guizhou Province, jointly established a livestock farm on the mountain dam this year. The farm now has more than 490 sheep, including 350 ewes, and 5 Corriedale rams.

　　Changshi Township is a high and cold mountainous area with three large and small mountain dams (wide and flat grasslands on the top of the mountains), covering an area of ​​more than 9,000 mu, all covered with lush pastures and clear springs. The average temperature is about 15 degrees Celsius, which is a very good natural pasture. There are also more than 3,900 mu of arable land on the dam. With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, agricultural production cooperatives have a large number of surplus labor and funds available to develop this natural pasture. This year, the three cooperatives invested a total of 3,000 yuan to buy sheep and build sheepfolds and dormitories. They also plan to reclaim 500 mu of wasteland in the autumn to plant corn, buckwheat and vegetables.

 　 长山等三社联合建立畜牧场
    贵州省大定县长石乡的长山、长水、长新三个农业生产合作社，今年在山坝上联合建立了一个畜牧场。该场现已有绵羊四百九十多只，其中有母羊三百五十只，还有考利黛种公羊五只。
    长石乡是高寒山区，有大小三个山坝（山顶上的宽阔而平坦的草原），面积约有九千多亩，都长着丰盛的牧草，并有清清的泉水，气温平均在摄氏十五度左右，是一个很好的天然牧场。坝上还有三千九百多亩可耕地。随着互助合作运动的发展，农业生产合作社有了大批的剩余劳动力和资金可利用来开发这个天然牧场。今年，这三个社共投资三千元，买了羊，修建了羊圈和宿舍。他们还计划秋后再开垦五百亩荒地，种植玉米、荞麦和蔬菜等。
