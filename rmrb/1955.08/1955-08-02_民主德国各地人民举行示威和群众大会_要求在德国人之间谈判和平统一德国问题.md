Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 30th. According to a report by the German News Agency: Encouraged by the results of the Geneva Four-Power Heads of Government Conference, 60,000 residents of Magdeburg in the German Democratic Republic, led by workers from five heavy machinery manufacturing factories, held demonstrations on the 28th, demanding negotiations between Germans on the peaceful reunification of Germany. Hilde Wand, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, addressed the demonstrating masses. He said: A united Germany is by no means a militaristic and revanchist Germany. The demonstrators adopted a resolution addressed to the People's Chamber, expressing their determination to strive for the reunification of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis.

On the same day, mass meetings were also held in Liessa and Ouffate. A farmer representative at the Liessa meeting called on farmers to complete the grain and oil crop payment quotas ahead of schedule to show their support for the government's efforts to improve people's lives and strive for the reunification of Germany.

    新华社柏林三十日电　据德意志通讯社报道：在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议结果的鼓舞下，德意志民主共和国马格德堡的六万居民以五个重型机器制造工厂的工人为先导，在二十八日举行示威，要求在德国人之间就和平重新统一德国的问题进行谈判。德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员希德万向示威的群众讲了话。他说：一个统一的德国绝不是一个军国主义和复仇主义的德国。示威者通过了致人民议院的决议，表示决心争取在和平和民主的基础上重新统一德国。
    同一天，利埃萨和欧法特也举行了群众大会。一个农民代表在利埃萨的大会上号召农民提前完成谷物和油类作物的缴纳额，以表示支持政府改善人民生活和争取统一德国的努力。
