Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 5th: U.S. President Eisenhower held a press conference on the 4th.

A reporter asked Eisenhower whether the ongoing negotiations between the United States and China might involve the status of Jinmen (Quemoy), Mazu (Matsu), and Taiwan. Eisenhower replied, "The purpose of the current negotiations is to discuss the issue of nationals of one country detained within the territory of another. We acknowledge that the talks may uncover other objectives and problems that can be discussed, but the Secretary of State and I have repeatedly stated that we do not intend to discuss the affairs of our friends in their absence. We consider the Nationalists in Taiwan to be our friends. We do not intend to discuss their future, their fate, or anything about them until they participate."

Another reporter, in posing a different question, mentioned that some people suggested that as a result of the ongoing Geneva talks, further negotiations with China could be planned. The reporter asked Eisenhower whether, after appropriate preparatory meetings, he would favor a top-level conference with all relevant parties to resolve Asian tensions. Eisenhower replied, "I don't think I would favor it at the moment, and I think it is too early to talk about the possibility of holding a top-level conference. Such a conference involves issues that some lower-level meetings do not. I believe the Secretary of State has said that these meetings leading to possible negotiations at the ministerial level are within the realm of possibility, but I don't think there is any implication of anything further..."

In response to a reporter's question about whether the U.S. government might recognize the People's Republic of China, Eisenhower said, "Under the current circumstances, there can be no change in the policy taken by the United States on the issue of recognizing Communist China."

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 5th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles held a press conference on the 2nd, discussing the Sino-American ambassadorial talks, the situation in the Taiwan region, and other issues.

A reporter asked whether there were any obstacles preventing Chinese people in the United States from returning to China. Dulles denied the existence of such obstacles. He said, "There are no restrictions on the return to China of any of these Chinese people here who have expressed a desire to return, especially students; we have been trying to find out which of them are willing to return home." When a reporter asked roughly how many of these students had requested to return to China, Dulles first said "roughly less than fifty," but even he admitted that he did "not have an exact number in mind."

Dulles said that the list presented by the United States in the Geneva Sino-American ambassadorial talks regarding the return of civilians on both sides included about forty American civilians in China, as well as approximately five hundred American soldiers missing in the Korean War. Dulles wanted China to provide information about the whereabouts of these nearly five hundred American soldiers and said that this list of nearly five hundred people would serve as the "basis for Ambassador Johnson's negotiations with Chinese Ambassador Wang Bingnan regarding repatriation." However, even Dulles himself admitted that "this list of nearly five hundred soldiers should not raise any hope that any of them are still alive."

Dulles spent a large portion of the press conference discussing the so-called ceasefire between China and the United States.

When a reporter asked Dulles about the U.S. wanting to discuss a ceasefire with China, mentioning Premier Zhou Enlai's speech on July 30th, in which Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out that the Chinese people do not want to fight with the United States, and therefore there is no issue of a ceasefire between China and the United States, the reporter asked Dulles, "You believe a ceasefire is an issue to be discussed. How do you reconcile these two different opinions?"

Dulles replied, "I think Mr. Zhou Enlai is using the word (referring to "ceasefire") in a rather technical sense, while I am using the word in a broad sense. It is true that there is currently no fighting between the Chinese Communist Party and the American army in that region. On the other hand, there is a very great danger of such fighting occurring." However, Dulles completely avoided mentioning, as Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in his speech, that the tense situation in the Taiwan region is caused by the United States occupying China's territory of Taiwan and interfering in China's liberation of the coastal islands. Dulles instead said, "What I have always hoped to obtain is an assurance that the Chinese Communist Party does not intend to use military force to achieve its ambitions in that region."

Dulles also mentioned that Premier Zhou Enlai quoted some of his words in his speech. He said, "I am very glad to see that Mr. Zhou Enlai apparently quoted with approval some of the words I had said, the general meaning of which was that no matter what differences exist between countries, they should not seek to resolve such differences by force." However, when talking about not resolving differences between countries by force, Dulles avoided mentioning the following passage that Premier Zhou Enlai had said in his speech: In order to prove that Dulles's words were "sincere," "the Chinese people are willing to see the armed forces of the United States withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait." Dulles instead demanded that the Chinese people not exercise sovereignty and "renounce the use of force" to liberate Taiwan.

A reporter asked Dulles, "Is what you are seeking not perhaps a ceasefire between the Nationalists and the Chinese, as most Americans have always imagined, but something much broader, perhaps like a declaration of the United Nations Charter, between the Chinese Communist Party and the United States?" Dulles replied, "That is correct." But he then added, "It must also be remembered that if the Chinese Communist Party there performs military activities aimed at taking Taiwan by force, the defense treaty we have with the Republic of China will come into effect." He also said, "That would almost certainly cause a war whose scope cannot be predicted in advance."

A reporter asked Dulles: "You said that you do not expect the idea of establishing a broader no-shooting arrangement to arise from the current Geneva talks. Are you seeking high-level talks? Or how do you think this matter (referring to the no-shooting arrangement) can be promoted?" Dulles said, "I expect this matter to be realized mainly in the form of a policy statement issued by the leader or ruler of a country, rather than as a topic of a bilateral agreement." Dulles also said that the United States hopes to gradually reach a point where China gives up the use of force to liberate Taiwan. He said, "The United States is unwilling to negotiate with a gun pointed at its head." He also said that many things have "indicated that the gun has been put down," but "this gun should be discarded forever."

Dulles said, "The release of airmen, the release of civilians (if it can be achieved), and the kind of statement issued by Zhou Enlai may mark the beginning of a new stage in the relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and the rest of the world." He said that the Geneva talks may be a step towards broader negotiations between China and the United States. At the same time, he also said that China needs to "commit" to "renouncing the use of force" in order to "pave the way" for broadly negotiating the main issues between China and the United States. Dulles also said that "the status of Taiwan, Jinmen, and Mazu is not negotiable."

Speaking of the resolution of the tense situation in the Taiwan region, Dulles said, "The world must coexist with some outstanding issues for some time." The Taiwan issue "cannot be legally resolved early." He also said that he was unwilling to say that China could achieve control of Taiwan by peaceful means in the foreseeable future. "On the Taiwan issue, the Communists and the rest of the world may have to coexist peacefully for a considerable period of time." "The status of Nationalist territory is a situation that the Chinese Communist Party will have to tolerate."

Dulles also said at the press conference that the United States is absolutely not prepared to abandon the Manila Treaty Organization, just as it is not prepared to abandon the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯谈中美会谈问题
    新华社五日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔四日举行记者招待会。
    有记者问艾森豪威尔，美国同中国正在进行的谈判是否可能牵涉到金门、马祖和台湾的地位。艾森豪威尔回答说：“举行目前的谈判是要讨论一国被扣留在另一国领土内的国民的问题。我们承认，会谈可能发现其他可以加以讨论的目标、问题，但是国务卿和我曾经一再说过，我们不打算在我们的朋友不在场的情况下讨论我们的朋友的事务。我们是把在台湾的国民党人看作我们的朋友的。在他们参加以前，我们不打算讨论他们的前途、他们的命运或关于他们的任何事情。”
    有记者在提出另一个问题时提到，有些人建议，作为目前正在进行的日内瓦会谈的结果，可以筹划同中国的进一步的谈判。这位记者问艾森豪威尔，如果举行了适当的准备会议以后，他是否赞成同一切有关方面举行最高级会议来解决亚洲紧张局势。艾森豪威尔回答说：“我想我在目前是不赞成的，我认为现在来谈论举行最高级会议的可能性为时是过早了。这种会议牵连一些较低级会议并不牵连的问题。我相信国务卿曾经说过，这些会议导致可能在部长一级的谈判，是在可能性的范围以内的，但是我认为并没有暗示进一步的事情……”
    在答复一位记者所提出的关于美国政府是否可能承认中华人民共和国的问题时，艾森豪威尔说：“在目前情况下，美国在承认共产党中国问题上采取的政策不可能有任何改变。”
    新华社五日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯二日举行记者招待会，谈到中美两国大使级会谈、台湾地区局势等问题。
    有记者问到目前是否有任何阻碍妨碍美国境内的中国人返回中国时，杜勒斯否认存在着这种障碍。他说：“对于这里的这些中国人中已经表示希望回去的任何人返回中国，是没有任何限制的，特别是学生，我们一直在设法探明他们中有谁愿意回国。”当记者问到这些学生中大概有多少人要求回到中国时，杜勒斯先说是“大致不到五十人”，但是连他自己也承认他“心中并没有精确的数目”。
    杜勒斯说，美国在日内瓦中美大使级会谈讨论双方平民回国问题中提出的名单里，包括约四十名在中国的美国平民，还包括大约五百名在朝鲜战争中失踪的美国军人。杜勒斯要中国提供关于这近五百名美国军人的下落，并且说，这近五百人的名单将作为美国大使约翰逊同中国大使王炳南“进行关于遣返谈判的基础”。但是，连杜勒斯自己也承认，“这张将近五百名军人的名单不应当引起他们之中有任何人还活着的任何希望。”
    杜勒斯在记者招待会上用很大部分的时间来谈论中国同美国间所谓停火的问题。
    有记者在向杜勒斯提出关于美国要同中国讨论停火的问题时，提到周恩来总理七月三十日的演说，周恩来总理在演说中指出，中国人民并不要同美国打仗，因此在中美之间不发生停火的问题。这位记者问杜勒斯，“你认为停火是一个要讨论的问题。你怎样把这两种不同的意见调和起来？”
    杜勒斯答复说，“我认为周恩来先生是从颇带技术性的意义上用这个字（按指“停火”）的，而我是从广义上用这个字的。不错，目前中国共产党和美国军队在这个地区内的确并没有任何战斗。另外一方面，却有发生这种战斗的非常大的危险。”但是，杜勒斯根本避免谈到，如周恩来总理在演说中指出的，台湾地区的紧张局势是由于美国占据中国的领土台湾和干涉中国解放沿海岛屿而造成的。杜勒斯反而说，“我所一直希望获得的就是中国共产党不打算使用军事力量来达到他们在那个地区的野心的保证。”
    杜勒斯又说到周恩来总理在演说中引用了他的一番话，他说，“我非常高兴看到周恩来先生显然用赞同的口吻援引我所说过的一番话，那番话的总的意思是说不论各国之间有什么分歧，都不应该图谋用武力来解决这种分歧。”然而，杜勒斯在谈到不应该用武力来解决各国之间的分歧时，避而不提周恩来总理在发言中曾说到的如下的一段话：为了证明杜勒斯这句话是“具有诚意的”，“中国人民愿意看到美国的武装力量从台湾和台湾海峡撤走”。杜勒斯却要求中国人民不要行使主权、“放弃使用武力”解放台湾。
    有记者问杜勒斯，是否他“在寻求的并不是或许大多数美国人一直想像中的国民党人和中国人之间的停火，而是中国共产党和美国之间的或许就是联合国宪章宣言之类的广泛得多的某种东西？”杜勒斯回答说：“这是正确的。”但是，他接着又说，“还必须记住，如果中国共产党在那里表演目的在于用武力拿下台湾的军事活动，我们同中华民国缔结的防御条约就要发生作用。”他还说，“那就差不多一定将引起一种无法预先规定其范围的战争”。
    有记者问杜勒斯：“你说过你不指望目前的日内瓦会谈中产生订立较为广泛的不得射击的安排的主意。你是想举行高级会谈吗？或者说，你以为怎样才能促成这事（按指不得射击的安排）？”杜勒斯说，“我期望这事主要是在一个国家的领袖或统治者发表一篇政策声明的方式下实现，而不是作为一个双边协议的题目。”杜勒斯还说，美国希望逐步达到使中国放弃用武力解放台湾。他说，“美国不愿意在手枪对着它的头部的情况下进行谈判。”他又说，已有许多事情“指明手枪已经放下”，但“这种手枪应该永远丢掉”。
    杜勒斯说，“飞行人员的获释，平民的释放（如果能够实现的话），周恩来所发表的那种声明，都可能标志着中国共产党同世界其他部分的关系的新阶段的开端。”他说，日内瓦会谈可能是走向中美最终举行较广泛的谈判的一步。同时，他又说，需要中国“承诺”“放弃使用武力”，才将为广泛地谈判中国与美国间的主要问题“铺平道路”。杜勒斯并且说，“台湾、金门和马祖的地位是不容谈判的”。
    谈到台湾地区紧张局势的解决时，杜勒斯说，“世界在若干时间内还必须同一些悬而未决的问题共处”。台湾问题“不可能早日得到合法的解决”。他并且说，他不愿意说中国能够在看得见的将来用和平方法达到控制台湾。“在台湾问题上共产党人和世界其余部分可能不得不在一个相当长的时期内相安共处”。“国民党领土的地位是中国共产党将不得不容忍的局势”。
    杜勒斯在记者招待会上并且说，美国绝对不准备放弃马尼拉条约组织，正同不准备放弃北大西洋公约组织一样。
