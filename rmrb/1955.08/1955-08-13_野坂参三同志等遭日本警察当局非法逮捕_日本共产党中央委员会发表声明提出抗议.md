　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th August: Japanese police authorities illegally arrested Japanese Communist Party leading cadres Nosaka Sanzō, Shida Shigeo, and Konno Yojiro on the afternoon of the 11th. This new act of persecution has aroused angry protests from the Japanese people.

　　Nosaka Sanzō and the other two were "purged" by the U.S. occupation authorities in Japan on the eve of the U.S. launching its war of aggression against Korea. At that time, they, along with all the Central Committee members of the Japanese Communist Party, were illegally prohibited from engaging in political activities. On the afternoon of August 11th, they attended a rally in Tokyo as members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party to celebrate the Sixth National Congress of the Japanese Communist Party. Their presence greatly excited the 6,000 people attending the rally, triggering stormy applause and cheers throughout the venue.

　　Nosaka Sanzō read out a statement at the meeting, jointly signed by the three of them, addressed to the people and all members of the Japanese Communist Party. The statement said, "When MacArthur launched the Korean War, he ordered the suppression of the Communist Party. In order to continue the struggle for national peace and freedom, we had to carry out underground struggles." The statement pointed out, "The inspection authorities are now attempting to arrest us. This is an anti-democratic act." The statement concluded, "In order to implement the resolutions of the Sixth National Congress as Central Committee members, we have returned to the people."

　　However, after the rally ended, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department arrested Nosaka Sanzō and the other two at the venue. The Metropolitan Police Department's excuse was that they had violated the "Group, etc., Control Ordinance," a law based on occupation regulations that had long expired with the invalidation of those regulations.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th August: Miyamoto Kenji, the person in charge of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, issued a statement on the 12th on behalf of the Central Committee, protesting the illegal arrest by Japanese police authorities of Japanese Communist Party Central Committee members Nosaka Sanzō, Shida Shigeo, and Konno Yojiro.

　　The statement pointed out: Comrades Nosaka Sanzō and the other two leading cadres came forward to openly struggle alongside the people for independence, democracy, and the stability of the people's livelihoods, and to implement the resolutions of the Sixth National Congress. The police authorities' arrest of these comrades has no legal basis; it is based on the extremely violent "Group, etc., Control Ordinance" formulated five years ago at the instigation of a foreign commander.

　　The statement pointed out: This is an act of subordinating Japan to a foreign government and denying Japan's independence.

　　The statement concluded by emphasizing: In order to have the authorities revoke the illegal arrest order, we are determined to work together with all party members and the people of the whole country to rescue the three comrades.

    野坂参三同志等遭日本警察当局非法逮捕
    日本共产党中央委员会发表声明提出抗议
    新华社十二日讯　东京消息：日本警察当局在十一日下午非法逮捕了日本共产党领导干部野坂参三、志田重男、绀野与次郎。这一新的迫害事件已经激起了日本人民的愤怒抗议。
    野坂参三等三个人是在美国发动侵略朝鲜的战争前夕遭到驻日美国占领当局“整肃”的。当时，他们和日本共产党所有的中央委员一起被非法禁止进行政治活动。八月十一日下午，他们以日本共产党中央委员的身份出席了在东京举行的庆祝日本共产党第六次全国代表会议的演讲会。他们的出席使参加演讲会的六千名群众兴奋异常，在全场引起了暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声。
    野坂参三在会上宣读了由他们三个人联名的告全国人民和全体日本共产党员的声明。声明说，“麦克阿瑟在发动朝鲜战争的时候，下令镇压共产党。我们为了继续进行争取民族的和平和自由的斗争，不得不进行不公开的斗争。”声明指出，“检查当局现在还企图逮捕我们。这是反民主的行为。”声明最后宣布，“我们为了以中央委员的身份执行第六次全国代表会议的决议，回到了人民的面前。”
    但是，在演讲会结束以后，东京警视厅就在会场上逮捕了野坂参三等三个人。警视厅的借口是他们违反了“团体等规正令”，而这个以占领法规为根据而颁布的法令早已随占领法规的失效而失效了。
    新华社十二日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会常任干部会负责人宫本显治十二日代表中央委员会发表声明，抗议日本警察当局非法逮捕日本共产党中央委员野坂参三、志田重男和绀野与次郎。
    声明指出：野坂参三等三位领导干部是为了公开地同人民一道进行斗争，争取独立、民主和人民生活安定，为了执行第六次全国代表会议的决议而出面的。警察当局对这些同志的逮捕是没有法律根据的，它所根据的是五年前由外国司令示意而制定的狂暴已极的“团体等规正令”。
    声明指出：这是把日本从属于外国政府、自己否认日本独立的举动。
    声明最后强调说：我们为了使当局撤销非法逮捕的命令，决心同全体党员和全国人民共同努力救出三位同志。
