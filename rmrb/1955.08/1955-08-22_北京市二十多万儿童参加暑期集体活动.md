Over 220,000 children in Beijing have happily participated in organized summer vacation activities.

The "Children's Home" has arranged a rich and varied summer program for the children. Here, children who love art met with the young actors of "Flowers of the Motherland" and "Chicken Feather Letter" and listened to the young actors talk about the interesting process of making movies. Seven hundred young activists in puppet art enjoyed a get-together with the actors of the China Puppet Art Theatre and watched their wonderful performances. Young science and technology enthusiasts entertained their young guests—more than fifty young science and technology enthusiasts from all over the country—exchanged scientific research experiences, and established deep friendships. On the evening of "August 1st," by the blazing bonfire, the children invited soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to tell them the fighting stories of the Chinese revolution. Children who love swimming, football, and singing participated in training classes organized by the "Children's Home."

The "Children's Home" club is a favorite place for children, and more than 36,000 children have already visited. When the Young Pioneers of two squadrons from Jingzhongmiao Primary School came here for a team day, they were immediately attracted by these interesting toys. Nine-year-old Sun Dongjie fell in love with the small square building blocks for arranging words as soon as he arrived. He used the building blocks to spell out the words in his heart with great concentration: "Defend World Peace." In August, the "Children's Home" added a "Youth Shooting Range," and two hundred children come here to shoot targets every day.

In Jingshan Park, 900 children have already participated in the youth summer camp. The children's library in the park is also open, and about 1,500 children read here every day. Members of the Youth Meteorological Station of the Affiliated Middle School of the Normal University held a starry sky evening party during the summer vacation. Young children from Liangjiadian, Shuanghuaishu, and other primary schools participated in field labor in agricultural production cooperatives during their summer vacation. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　北京市二十多万儿童参加暑期集体活动
    北京市有二十二万少年儿童，愉快地参加了有组织的暑期活动。
    “少年之家”为孩子们安排了丰富多采的暑期活动。在这儿，爱好艺术的孩子们和“祖国的花朵”、“鸡毛信”的小演员们见了面，听了小演员们介绍拍摄电影的有趣过程。七百个少年木偶艺术积极分子同中国木偶艺术剧团的演员们联欢，并看了他们的精采演出。少年科学技术爱好者们招待了自己的小客人——五十多个来自祖国各地的少年科学技术爱好者，交换了科学研究经验，并建立了深厚的友谊。“八一”的晚上，在熊熊的篝火旁，孩子们邀请了中国人民解放军战士，为他们讲中国革命的战斗故事。爱好游泳、足球、歌唱的孩子们，参加了“少年之家”举办的训练班。
    “少年之家”的俱乐部是孩子们喜爱的地方，已经有三万六千多个孩子来玩过。精忠庙小学两个中队的少先队员到这儿来过队日时，立刻就被这些有趣的玩艺吸引住了。九岁的孙东杰一来就爱上了摆字的小方块积木，他十分专心地用积木摆出了心头的话：“保卫世界和平”。八月份“少年之家”又增加了一个“少年靶场”，每天都有两百个少年儿童到这儿来打靶。
    在景山公园内，已经有九百个孩子参加了少年夏令营。公园内的儿童图书馆也开放了，每天都有一千五百名左右的孩子在这里阅读。师大附中少年气象站组员，在暑期中举行了星空晚会。亮甲店、双槐树等小学的少年儿童，利用暑假时间参加了农业生产合作社的田间劳动。　（新华社）
