Doing a Good Job in Design Budgeting Is an Important Part of Saving Funds
    The first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy in our country put forward the huge task of constructing and renovating 7,600 large and small units within five years. According to the investment plans of these units, the state allocated a total of 42.744 billion yuan for capital construction funds within five years. This large-scale construction plan, on the one hand, shows that the responsibility of the capital construction department is very glorious, and on the other hand, it puts forward a serious task for each construction unit, that is, how to use state funds rationally and economically and give full play to the effect of investment. In order to achieve this goal, a lot of work needs to be done, and the first thing is to implement the central government's policy of practicing strict economy, and accurately compile the budget for each construction project, which is the design budget. Because the investment stipulated in the Five-Year Plan for each construction unit is only formulated according to general control indicators, the cost of most projects can be greatly reduced in the design and construction process. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct careful calculations based on specific conditions and the manpower and materials required for each item. The quality of this calculation work will ultimately be reflected in the design budget. Whether the design budget is accurate or not not only affects the amount of state appropriations occupied, but also is an important link in improving capital construction work. Especially in the latter three years of the Five-Year Plan, the amount of construction projects is very large and the state invests a lot. To practice strict economy and overcome waste in capital construction, it is an important and urgent task to prepare a good design budget.
    Compiling a design budget is still a new task in my country's capital construction department. Before 1954, due to the lack of experience and conditions for compiling design budgets, many construction units in my country only had design workload but no careful budget. Spending money was done by means of actual reimbursement, and how much was spent was counted. This situation once caused great waste. For example, the Liaoyuan Central Shaft started construction in 1950 and is expected to be handed over to production at the end of 1955, with an investment of 50 million yuan. If the compilation and review of the design budget could have been done before the start of construction, at least 6 million yuan could have been saved. Since the second half of 1954, the design institutions and budget institutions of various departments and some provinces and cities have begun to be established, and the phenomenon of projects without budgets has begun to change, but because the organizational structure for compiling design budgets is still not substantial and the system is not sound, the phenomenon of starting construction without a design budget or without budget approval has not been completely eliminated. As of the end of May this year, among the more than 4,100 units that have started construction, half of them have allocated funds for construction based only on construction documents or even without construction documents. This situation is of course extremely serious and extremely harmful.
    Even in units that already have a design budget, many design budgets are still very inaccurate, and the budgets made by various units are generally too high. In 1954, the Construction Bank reviewed 4,308 budgets and found that the overestimation accounted for 7.8 percent of the total budget value, worth more than 49 million yuan. As of the end of May 1955, among the budgets of 1.17 billion yuan that had been reviewed, the overestimation was found to be more than 87 million yuan. And these budgets have been repeatedly reduced by the State Construction Commission, various ministries, and various provinces and cities before being submitted to the Construction Bank. If you look at the initial estimates of various units, the overestimated figures are even more alarming. Allocating funds according to this inaccurate budget will accumulate a lot of valuable funds and provide great convenience for wasteful behavior, which is not difficult to imagine. Last year, the Eighth Engineering Company of the Electric Power Bureau lost and wasted 2.06 million yuan in contracting the Taiyuan First Power Plant project, but due to the high budget, it was found to have made a profit of 1.07 million yuan at the end of the year. This incident more powerfully illustrates how serious consequences can be brought about if the budget work is not done well!
    Why does this phenomenon occur? First of all, many construction units do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of compiling design budgets, especially compiling accurate design budgets. They do not understand that only an accurate design budget can correctly organize the manpower, materials, and financial resources necessary for construction, and ensure that the investment in capital construction produces the greatest effect; can make construction appropriations and the signing of contracted projects based on a sound basis; can supervise and analyze the economic activities of construction projects, and promote construction units to implement and strengthen economic accounting from all aspects, and improve management work conscientiously. If the budget is not accurately prepared, it will not only waste state funds, but also bring serious consequences to the capital construction cause. Because the design budget is inaccurate, and the labor, materials, and project costs are overestimated, it will cover up and condone backward phenomena such as lax labor discipline and low labor productivity, provide great convenience for extravagance and waste, and make it easy to reduce project costs, thereby making the staff of construction and installation enterprises feel lazy about improving management level. To take a step back, even if the construction enterprise can be meticulous and practice strict economy in the construction process, if the budget is inaccurate and the expenditure is too wide, the excess funds will not be settled until the project is completed, which will also cause the state's useful funds to be accumulated for a long time and cannot be effective. Therefore, preparing a good budget for construction projects is by no means a "financial procedure" for the construction unit, but an extremely important measure to prevent waste and promote economy, and an important system to ensure the economy and rational use of state construction funds.
    Secondly, from the perspective of the organization of budget preparation, there were also many shortcomings in the past. The most important thing is that there is no unified system for preparing budgets. Some construction departments do not hand over the budget to the design department for preparation, but to the construction department that directly uses the money. The construction department feels that "it is easy to get things done with more money" and wants to easily obtain profits, so they often overestimate and demand more. At the same time, the design and budget review institutions at all levels are not sound enough, and some even only review the design but not the budget. There are too few budget staff in various units, and the quality is also low, so they cannot accurately prepare budgets and conduct strict reviews. Sometimes the budget cannot be submitted one quarter or half a year after the design is submitted; sometimes the budget is prepared only when the construction is about to end, and this budget has no practical significance, but is just a financial procedure. Obviously, this situation is unfavorable to the implementation of the policy of economy in the capital construction department, and it should be resolutely changed.
    To do a good job in the preparation of the design budget, the most important thing is to strictly prepare according to the quotas stipulated by the state. The quota is the basis of the budget. Only by relying on scientific and advanced quotas can we prepare an accurate and high-quality budget. For example, in bricklaying, if we set the amount of bricks used per square meter of building too large, far exceeding the actual required number, set the efficiency of bricklaying per worker per day too low, far behind the standards that can actually be achieved, and set the transportation cost and loss rate of bricks higher than the actual cost, then we will inevitably falsely increase the cost of the entire bricklaying project. Such a budget is of course not what we need. In order to control the design budget of construction projects from this basic link, the state has promulgated the 1955 construction project budget quota. This quota is prepared according to the actual situation of construction projects in our country, referring to the experience of the Soviet Union, and applying the principle of average advanced quota. Although these quotas are not complete enough, they can basically be used as the basis and standard for us to prepare and review the budgets of construction projects, and as a weapon to guide and urge the construction departments to strive for greater economic benefits. All capital construction units should conscientiously implement it. Some professional engineering budget quotas have not yet been formulated by the state, and the relevant departments should supplement them to make our budget quotas more complete and expand the guiding and controlling role of the quotas.
    In order to do a good job in preparing design budgets, the budget preparation system should also be appropriately changed. In the future, budget documents should be prepared by the design institutions, and the designers should be responsible for the budget value of the projects they design. This can avoid the problem of intentional overestimation caused by the construction department's preparation, and can also prompt the designers to consider economic effects more when deciding on engineering technical issues. Now, the general designers have begun to pay attention to economic issues in design. By implementing this system, they will further play a role in saving state construction funds.
    To improve the quality of the budget, special attention should be paid to strengthening the review of the budget. The budget of the Wuhan Boiler Factory construction project is not the worst at present, but when the First Ministry of Machinery Industry reviewed the budget of this project this year, it cut off 10.92 percent of the total budget investment. It can be seen that doing a good job in review has a huge effect on saving funds. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly establish and improve the design and budget review institutions at all levels. The personnel responsible for the review work should work harder to study business, learn the country's economic policies, and with a high sense of responsibility for the country's construction cause, conduct a comprehensive and strict review of the budget documents' compilation methods, the amount of work based on them, the quotas adopted, and the size of various expenses.
    After the budget is approved, the finance department should conduct strict supervision of the construction department according to the budget. When the Construction Bank allocates funds, it should gradually implement the payment system according to the project progress, that is, to see how much workload the construction unit has completed, and then decide how much funds to allocate. This strict supervision of the construction department's use of capital construction investment in accordance with the plan and budget can prevent the tendency to arbitrarily misappropriate funds or disperse the funds for use on unimportant projects. In the process of construction, the construction unit should accept the supervision of the Construction Bank and strive to improve the level of operation and management, rectify the construction organization, prepare for construction, give play to the effectiveness of equipment, conduct economic accounting, save labor and materials, and conduct regular financial inspections. According to the analysis and calculation of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, as long as the construction unit can strive to improve its work in accordance with the above requirements, it is entirely possible to further reduce the cost on the basis of the state-stipulated construction project budget quota.
    The design budget work of construction projects is a new work in our country. All relevant departments should give it full attention and support, and strive to fully launch this work and lay the foundation this year, so as to achieve greater results in saving capital construction funds.

### 做好设计预算是节约资金的重要环节

    做好设计预算是节约资金的重要环节
    我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，提出了要在五年内兴建和改建七千六百个大小单位的巨大的基本建设任务，根据这些单位的投资计划，五年内国家拨付的基本建设资金共达四百二十七亿四千万元。这个大规模的建设计划，一方面说明了基本建设部门的责任是十分光荣的，另一方面也向每个建设单位提出了一个严重的任务，这就是如何合理地、经济地使用国家的资金，充分发挥投资的效果。为了达到这个目的，需要进行很多工作，而首先就是要贯彻中央厉行节约的方针，准确地编好每一项建设工程的预算，也就是设计预算。因为五年计划规定的每项建设单位的投资，只是根据一般的控制指标拟定的，在设计和建设过程中，多数工程的造价是可以大大降低的。因此，就必须根据具体条件和每个细目所需用的人力物力进行周密的计算，这种计算工作的好坏，最后都表现在设计预算上。设计预算的准确与否，不仅影响占用国家拨款的多少，而且也是改善基本建设工作的一个重要环节。特别是在五年计划的后三年中，建设工程量很大，国家投资很多，要在基本建设中厉行节约，克服浪费，编好设计预算，更是一项重大的迫切的工作。
    编制设计预算，在我国基本建设部门中还是一项新的工作。一九五四年以前，由于编制设计预算的经验和条件都不具备，我国的很多建设单位只有设计工作量而没有周密的预算，花钱是采用实报实销的办法，用多少算多少。这种情况，曾经造成了很大的浪费，例如辽源中央竖井，于一九五○年动工，预计一九五五年底移交生产，投资达五千万元，如果在开工前能作好设计预算的编审工作，则至少可节约投资六百万元。一九五四年下半年开始，各部门和某些省市的设计机构同预算机构开始建立起来了，工程没有预算的现象开始有了改变，但是由于编制设计预算的组织机构仍不充实，制度还不健全，没有设计预算或预算没有批准就开工的现象仍然没有完全消除。今年到五月底为止，已开工建设的四千一百多个单位中，就有一半是只凭施工文件甚至连施工文件也没有就拨款施工了。这种情况当然是极其严重的和极其有害的。
    就是在已经有了设计预算的单位，很多设计预算也还很不准确，各个单位所做的预算一般都偏高。建设银行一九五四年审查了四千三百零八件预算，发现高估的部分占预算总值百分之七点八，共值四千九百多万元。一九五五年五月底止已审查的十一亿七千多万元的预算中，发现高估的部分就有八千七百多万元。而这些预算在送交建设银行以前，还经过国家建设委员会、各部和各省市一再削减。如果看一看各单位最初的概算，高估的数字更是惊人。按照这种不准确的预算来拨款，将会积压很多宝贵的资金，给浪费行为大开方便之门，这是不难设想的。去年，电业总局第八工程公司在承包太原第一发电站工程中，损失浪费了二百零六万元，但由于预算做得很高，年终结算时发现竟取得了一百零七万元的利润。这件事更有力地说明了，预算工作做得不好，将会带来多么严重的恶果！
    为什么会产生这种现象呢？首先是很多建设单位对编制设计预算，特别是编制准确的设计预算的重要意义认识不足。他们不了解，只有准确的设计预算，才能正确地组织施工所必需的人力、物力、财力，保证基本建设的投资产生最大的效果；才能使建设拨款和签订包工合同有所根据；才能监督和分析建设工程的经济活动，并从各方面促进建设单位实行和加强经济核算制，兢兢业业地改进管理工作。如果预算编得不准确，不仅浪费国家资金，也会给基本建设事业带来严重的后果。因为设计预算编得不准，多算了人工、材料和工程造价，就会掩盖和纵容劳动纪律松弛和劳动生产率低下等落后现象，给铺张浪费行为大开方便之门，就会不用费力地做到降低工程成本，从而使建筑安装企业的工作人员对提高管理水平产生懈怠之心。退一步说，即使建筑企业在施工过程中能精打细算、厉行节约，但是如果预算不准，开支打得过宽，多余的资金要到工程竣工时才能做出结算，也会使国家有用的资金长期积压着不能发挥效果。所以，编好建设工程预算，决不是施工单位的一个“财政手续”，而是防止浪费和推动节约的一个极重要的措施，是保证节约与合理使用国家建设资金的一项重要制度。
    其次，从编制预算的组织工作方面来看，过去也存在不少的缺点。最重要的就是没有统一的编制预算的制度，有些建设部门把预算不交给设计部门去编，而是交给直接用钱的施工部门去编。而施工部门觉得“钱多好办事”，又想容易地取得利润，便常常高估多要。同时，各级设计与预算审核机构也不健全，有的甚至只审查设计不审核预算。各单位的预算工作人员太少，质量也低，不能精确地编制预算和进行严格的审核。有时在设计交出后一季或半年还交不出预算；有时甚至到施工快结束时才把预算编出来，这种预算已经毫无实际意义，只不过是一个财政手续罢了。显然的这种状况对在基本建设部门中贯彻节约方针是不利的，应该坚决加以改变。
    要做好编制设计预算的工作，最重要的是要严格地按照国家规定的定额来编制。定额是预算的基础，只有依据科学的先进的定额，才能编制出准确的、质量良好的预算。譬如砌砖，如果我们把每平方公尺建筑物的用砖量订得过大，远远超过实际需要数，把每工每天砌砖的效率订得过低，远远落后于实际上能够达到的标准，并且把砖的运输费用和损耗率都订得高于实际，那末，我们就必然会虚假地提高了整个砌砖工程的造价。这样的预算当然不是我们所需要的。为了从这个基本环节上来控制建设工程的设计预算，国家已颁布了一九五五年度的建筑工程预算定额。这个定额是根据我国建筑工程的实际情况，参考苏联的经验，应用平均先进定额的原则编制的。这些定额虽然还不够完备，但基本上可以作为我们编制与审核建设工程预算的根据和标准，作为指导和督促施工部门为争取更大的经济效果而斗争的武器。一切基本建设单位都应该认真地加以贯彻。有些专业工程的预算定额目前国家还没有来得及制定，各个有关的部门应该加以补充，以使得我们的预算定额更加完备，使定额的指导和控制作用更加扩大。
    为了做好编制设计预算的工作，预算的编制制度也应作适当变更。今后，预算文件应由设计机构编制，设计人员应该对自己设计的工程的预算价值负责。这样就可以避免由施工部门去编而产生故意编高的毛病，而且可以促使设计人员在决定工程技术问题时更多考虑到经济效果。现在一般的设计人员已开始重视设计中的经济问题，通过贯彻这一制度，他们将进一步发挥对节省国家建设资金的作用。
    要提高预算的质量，特别要注意加强对预算的审核工作。武汉锅炉厂建设工程的预算，在目前并不是最差的，但今年第一机械工业部审核这个工程的预算时，竟削减掉了占总预算的百分之十点九二的投资。由此可见，做好审核工作，对节约资金有着巨大的作用。因此，需要迅速地建立与健全各级设计与预算审核机构。而担负审核工作的人员，应该更加努力钻研业务，学习国家的经济政策，以对国家建设事业的高度责任心，对预算文件的编制方法、所根据的工程量、所采用的定额及各种费用的大小，进行全面的严格的审查。
    预算批准以后，财政部门要根据预算对施工部门进行严格的监督。建设银行拨款时，要逐步作到按工程进度付款制，即是看施工单位已完成多少工作量，然后决定拨给多少款。这样严格地监督施工部门按计划、按预算使用基本建设投资，就可以防止任意挪用资金或把资金分散使用在不重要的工程上的偏向。在施工过程中，施工单位应接受建设银行的监督并努力提高经营管理水平，整顿施工组织，作好施工准备工作，发挥设备效用，进行经济核算，节约人工、材料，经常进行财务方面的检查。据建筑工程部的分析计算，施工单位只要能按上述要求努力改善工作，在国家规定的建筑工程预算定额的水平上再进一步降低造价，是完全可能的。
    建设工程的设计预算工作在我国是一项新的工作，各个有关部门都应该予以充分的重视和支持，争取在今年内把这项工作全面展开和打下基础，从而在节省基本建设资金方面取得更大的成绩。
