Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: Farmers in Sichuan, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and other provinces in the Yangtze River basin are actively rushing to plant late autumn crops after harvesting early-maturing autumn crops to increase total grain production.

　　Sichuan Province initially plans that more than 10 million farming households across the province will increase planting of late autumn crops by an average of 0.3 to 0.5 mu per household, which can produce more than 300 million jin of grain. In Yibin Prefecture, in addition to planting more than 30,000 mu of double-cropping rice, farmers are also cultivating regenerated rice on a large scale after harvesting mid-season rice, and planting autumn corn, autumn sweet potatoes, autumn potatoes, and other crops. Autumn corn, autumn potatoes, and other crops have already been sown in Nanbu County. Twenty-five agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in Duwei Township, Nanchong City, are also planting 14 kinds of late autumn crops such as radishes, autumn potatoes, broad beans, and peas. Hunan Province plans to sow 10 million mu of late autumn crops such as autumn sweet potatoes, autumn potatoes, autumn corn, buckwheat, and beans, an increase of 7.1% over last year. It is estimated that the completion of this plan can produce 785 million jin of grain. At present, farmers in various places are rushing to harvest mid-season rice and other early-maturing autumn crops, while plowing fields and rushing to plant late autumn crops. As of the 15th, Hengyang and Chenxian Prefectures have planted more than 700,000 mu of autumn sweet potatoes, buckwheat, mud beans, and other crops. Farmers in Shaoyang Prefecture, the main trial planting area for autumn potatoes, are currently sowing. Farmers in Anhui Province are also vigorously rushing to plant various late autumn crops. The province plans to plant more than 26 million mu of crops such as late rice, autumn corn, autumn potatoes, buckwheat, and late sesame. If there are no unexpected natural disasters, it can harvest 2.2 billion to 2.5 billion jin of grain. Farmers in the early rice and early corn producing areas of Jiangsu Province have rushed to plant about 2.5 million mu of late autumn crops such as mung beans and buckwheat. Calculated at 100 jin per mu, these late autumn crops can produce 250 million jin of grain. Songjiang Prefecture has sown 480,000 mu of late autumn crops, an increase of 20% over last year. In Nanhui County, more than 174,000 mu of the 2.4 million mu of early rice fields have been rushed to plant late autumn crops, and the planting area has doubled compared with last year. Farmers in Fengxian County are plowing and planting as they harvest wheat, and the 100,000 mu of mung beans are growing vigorously. Farmers in the Lixiahe area of northern Jiangsu have planted many carrots.

　　Sichuan and other provinces have a mild autumn climate and a long frost-free period throughout the year, and natural conditions are relatively superior. In last year's agricultural overproduction movement, these areas proved that under the condition of not affecting land fertility or affecting the planting of winter crops such as winter wheat, it is possible to increase the harvest of land by increasing the planting of a season of late autumn crops in accordance with local conditions. This year, in order to further promote the increase in planting of a season of late autumn crops, various parts of Sichuan Province have summarized the experience of increasing production by increasing planting by one season last year, and the Department of Agriculture has also introduced the cultivation techniques and promotion methods of various late autumn crops in local newspapers. The agricultural departments of various counties in Hunan Province have held various autumn crop technology training courses, training a total of more than 24,000 district and township cadres leading production, key members of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, and labor models. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places are actively organizing the supply of seeds, fertilizers, and agricultural tools to support farmers in expanding autumn planting. The grain departments of Anhui Province have timely supplied a large number of late autumn crops to farmers, and the Department of Agriculture has also specially convened a provincial experience exchange meeting on accumulating fertilizer and applying fertilizer, summarizing and promoting advanced experience in accumulating fertilizer and applying fertilizer.

　　四川湖南等省加种一季晚秋作物
    新华社二十八日讯　长江流域的四川、湖南、安徽、江苏等省农民收获秋季早熟作物后，积极抢种晚秋作物，以增加粮食总产量。
    四川省初步计划全省一千多万农户平均每户将增种三分到五分田的晚秋作物，共可产粮食三亿斤以上。宜宾专区农民除栽插了三万多亩双季稻的晚稻外，还在收获中稻后大量培育再生稻，种植秋玉米、秋红薯、秋马铃薯等作物。南部县秋玉米、秋马铃薯等作物已经下种。南充市都蔚乡二十五个农业生产合作社和互助组也在栽种萝卜、秋马铃薯、蚕豆、豌豆等十四种晚秋作物。湖南省计划播种秋红薯、秋马铃薯、秋玉米、荞麦、豆类等晚秋作物一千万亩，比去年扩大百分之七点一。预计完成这一计划，可产粮食七亿八千五百万斤。现在各地农民正一边抢收中稻和其他秋季早熟作物，一边犁田抢种晚秋作物。衡阳、郴县两专区到十五日止已种上秋红薯、荞麦、泥豆等七十多万亩。秋马铃薯主要试种地区邵阳专区的农民正在进行播种。安徽省农民也大力抢种各种晚秋作物。全省计划种植晚稻、秋玉米、秋马铃薯、荞麦、晚芝麻等作物二千六百多万亩，如无意外的自然灾害，可收粮食二十二亿斤到二十五亿斤。江苏省早稻和早玉米等作物地区的农民抢种了约二百五十万亩绿豆、荞麦等晚秋作物。按每亩收一百斤计算，这些晚秋作物可产二亿五千万斤粮食。松江专区播种晚秋作物四十八万亩，比去年扩大百分之二十。南汇县二百四十万亩早稻田，有十七万四千多亩抢种上了晚秋作物，种植面积比去年扩大一倍左右。奉贤县农民随收麦随耕、随种，现在十万亩绿豆生长旺盛。苏北里下河地区农民种了很多胡萝卜。
    四川等省秋季气候温和，全年无霜期长，自然条件比较优越。这些地区在去年农业超额增产运动中，证明了在不影响土地肥力或不影响种植冬小麦等冬季作物的条件下，可以因地制宜增种一季晚秋作物，来提高土地的收获量。今年为了进一步推广增种一季晚秋作物，四川省各地都总结了去年增种一季的增产经验，农业厅并在当地报纸上介绍了各种晚秋作物的栽培技术和推广办法。湖南省各县农业部门都举办了各项秋季作物技术训练班，共训练了领导生产的区、乡干部和农业生产合作社、互助组骨干以及劳动模范二万四千多人。各地供销合作社正积极组织供应种籽、肥料和农具，支援农民扩大秋种。安徽省粮食部门把大量晚秋作物及时供应农民，农业厅还专门召开全省积肥施肥经验交流会，总结和推广了积肥施肥的先进经验。
