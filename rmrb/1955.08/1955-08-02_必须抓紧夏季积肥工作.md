    It is essential to seize the summer opportunity to accumulate fertilizer

    The amount of fertilizer prepared in rural areas across the country this year is insufficient. In many regions, the planting area of high-yield crops and industrial raw material crops has been expanded, making the fertilizer shortage even more severe. Taking effective measures to change this situation is an important issue in our country's current agricultural production.

    Insufficient application of fertilizer to farmland has been a fairly common phenomenon in agricultural production in our country. According to rough estimates, in 1954, approximately 40% of the sown area nationwide was not fertilized. Farmers called this type of land "sterile land." This year, the fertilizer prepared in various regions is generally less than last year, leading to a fairly widespread phenomenon of reducing the area of fertilized land. According to statistics from 51 counties in Jiangsu Province, the sown area with base fertilizer applied this year only accounts for 62% of the total sown area, which is much less than last year. This year's agricultural production increase targets are higher than last year, but most regions have prepared and applied less fertilizer than last year. This is a major contradiction, one that must be overcome. Summer is the season with the most fertilizer sources. Departments in various regions leading agricultural production should immediately mobilize the masses to seize the time to increase fertilizer accumulation and prepare topdressing fertilizer for late rice in the south and late autumn crops in the north, as well as base fertilizer for autumn and winter crops.

    Many rural workers only expect the state to increase the supply of chemical fertilizers and oilseed cakes to solve the local fertilizer shortage. This is an unrealistic idea. Although the supply of commercial fertilizers in our country is increasing every year, it is far from meeting the needs of agricultural production. Existing commercial fertilizers must be given priority for economic crops such as cotton and hemp; most grain crops cannot use them. On the other hand, the sources of farm manure in our country are extremely wide, and human and animal excrement is abundant and of good quality. With a population of 600 million, more than 80 million large livestock, and nearly 200 million pigs and sheep, the country can produce more than 1 billion tons of manure and stable manure annually. If 70% of this is utilized, applying half a ton per mu of farmland would solve the fertilizer problem for nearly 70% of the sown area nationwide. The quantity would be even greater if poultry manure is added. Under the current conditions, placing the hope of solving the fertilizer problem on this aspect is realistic. According to rough estimates, at least more than half of the human and animal excrement nationwide is not being utilized, which is the greatest waste of fertilizer resources in our country. This wasteful phenomenon must be eliminated. In the southern paddy field areas, there are approximately 200 million mu of cultivated land suitable for planting green manure crops, but very little was planted this year. Farmers in these areas should quickly prepare seeds and restore green manure crops. In the northern dryland areas, there are approximately 60 million mu of summer fallow land with one crop per year, which can be planted with summer crops for green manure and fertilizer accumulation. There are many weeds in the north and south, which are extremely lush every summer. Using these weeds to compost fertilizer is an effective way to solve the fertilizer shortage.

    All regions should immediately conduct an inspection of fertilizer accumulation work, use specific examples to educate cadres and the masses, analyze the severity of fertilizer shortage, find various fertilizer sources, and overcome the erroneous idea of "no fertilizer to accumulate." Farmers in various regions have a lot of experience in fertilizer accumulation. Seriously summarizing and widely promoting this experience locally can further develop fertilizer accumulation work. In areas where there is no habit of using human and animal excrement, the masses should be educated and persuaded to resolutely overcome conservative ideas, actively utilize this valuable resource, and quickly eliminate the phenomenon of no toilets for people and no pens for livestock. In areas where there is already a habit of using human and animal excrement, technical guidance should be further strengthened to improve utilization efficiency. All regions should systematically control urban garbage, excrement, and waste materials from slaughterhouses and fishing grounds, make various mixed fertilizers, and supply them in large quantities to meet the needs of agricultural production. A portion of the surplus labor force and all available labor force in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams should be drawn to participate in perennial fertilizer accumulation work. State bank fertilizer loans and sideline loans must be used to encourage the masses to accumulate fertilizer and support the masses in raising livestock, pigs, and sheep. This will not only open up fertilizer sources but also increase sideline production.

    Agricultural production cooperatives in various regions have a large task of increasing production and should pay more attention to the work of accumulating and creating fertilizer. At present, the economic conditions of most agricultural production cooperatives are not strong. Vigorously promoting fertilizer accumulation and application by each household can reduce production investment and lower production costs. Agricultural production cooperatives should stipulate appropriate fertilizer accumulation quotas and incentive systems to ensure that members are willing to accumulate fertilizer and receive corresponding remuneration. Newly established agricultural cooperatives should fairly and reasonably stipulate the method of discounting the value of fertilizer contributed to the cooperative to encourage members' enthusiasm for fertilizer accumulation.

    In order to fully utilize the effectiveness of fertilizer, attention should be paid to studying fertilization methods and fertilization technology, and improving fertilizer storage methods to avoid sun exposure and rain, which leads to fertilizer loss. Currently, it is the rainy season, and more attention should be paid to fertilizer storage. Agricultural agencies and technology extension stations in various regions should earnestly summarize local fertilizer accumulation experiences, lead the masses in formulating long-term fertilizer accumulation plans, and correct the practice of treating fertilizer accumulation work as a temporary crash task, "starting with a bang and ending with a whimper."

    Bacterial fertilizers and granular fertilizers have a great effect on increasing production and have a low cost. The trial use of these fertilizers in various regions has been effective. This year, many regions have expanded the scope of using these fertilizers, which is a good phenomenon. These regions should summarize the experience of farmers in using these fertilizers, find specific examples of timely use and significant production increases, further publicize the effective role of these fertilizers to farmers, and strive to further promote their use.

    必须抓紧夏季积肥工作
    今年全国各地农村准备的肥料是不充足的，许多地区又扩大了高产作物和工业原料作物的种植面积，因此，肥料不足的情况就更严重了。采取有效措施改变这种情况，是我国当前农业生产中的重要问题。
    农田施肥数量不足，原是我国农业生产中相当普遍的现象。据粗略的估计，一九五四年全国约有百分之四十的播种面积没有施肥，农民把这种耕地称为“斋田”。今年各地准备的肥料，一般比去年还要少，因此，相当普遍地发生了缩小施肥面积的现象。据江苏省五十一个县的统计，今年施用基肥的播种面积只占总播种面积的百分之六十二，比去年少得多。今年农业增产指标比去年高，多数地区准备和施用的肥料却比去年少，这是一个大矛盾，一个必须加以克服的矛盾。夏季正是肥源最多的季节，各地领导农业生产的部门应该立即发动群众，抓紧时间增积肥料，把南方的晚稻、北方的晚秋作物需要的追肥和秋种、冬种作物需要的基肥准备好。
    有许多农村工作人员，只指望国家增加化学肥料和饼肥的供应，来解决当地肥料不足的问题。这是不切实际的想法。目前我国的商品肥料虽然每年都有增加，但远远不能满足农业生产的需要。现有的商品肥料必须优先用于棉、麻等经济作物，多数粮食作物是使用不上的。但另一方面，我国农家肥料来源极为广泛，人畜粪尿更是量多质好。全国六亿人口，八千多万头大牲畜，近两亿只猪羊，每年可出产十亿多吨的粪便和厩肥。如果其中百分之七十获得利用，每亩农田施用半吨，全国近百分之七十的播种面积的肥料问题就可以解决。如果加上家禽的粪便，数量就更大了。在目前条件下，把解决肥料问题的希望放在这一方面，这才是实事求是的。据粗略估计，目前全国至少还有一半以上的人畜粪尿未被利用，这是我国肥料资源的最大浪费。这种浪费现象必须消除。南方水田地区有两亿亩左右的耕地可种绿肥作物，但今年种植的却非常少。这些地区的农民要赶快准备种籽，把绿肥作物恢复起来。北方旱作地区，约有六千万亩一年一作的夏季休闲地，可以种植夏季作物，压青积肥。南北各地有很多杂草，每逢夏季极为茂盛，利用这些杂草沤制肥料，是解决肥料不足问题的有效办法。
    各个地区应该立即对积肥工作进行一次检查，用具体事例教育干部和群众，分析缺乏肥料的严重程度，寻找各种肥料来源，克服“无肥可积”的错误思想。各地农民都有不少积肥经验，认真加以总结，就地普遍推广，很可以使积肥工作进一步开展起来。在没有使用人畜粪尿习惯的地区，应该教育和说服群众，坚决克服保守思想，积极利用这种宝贵的资源，迅速消灭人无厕所、畜无栏圈的现象。在已有使用人畜粪尿习惯的地区，应该进一步加强技术指导，提高利用效率。各地都应该有计划地控制城市垃圾、粪便和屠宰场、渔场的废弃物品，制成各种杂肥，大量供应农业生产的需要。农业生产合作社、互助组的剩余劳动力和一切可以利用的劳动力，应该抽出一部分来参加常年的积肥工作。国家银行的肥料贷款和副业贷款，必须利用来鼓励群众积肥，扶持群众养牧猪羊；这样，既开辟了肥料来源，又增加了副业生产。
    各地农业生产合作社的增产任务很大，更应该重视积肥造肥的工作。目前多数农业生产合作社的经济条件还不强，大量提倡每家积肥和施用肥料，就可以减少生产投资，降低生产成本。农业生产合作社应该规定适当的积肥定额和奖励制度，保证社员愿意积肥并获得相应的报酬。新建立的农业合作社应该公平合理地规定肥料入社折价的办法，以鼓励社员积肥的积极性。
    为了充分发挥肥料的效能，要注意研究施肥方法和施肥技术，并改进肥料储存方法，以免日晒雨淋，肥分流失。目前正是多雨季节，更应注意肥料的保管。各地农业机关和技术推广站应该认真总结当地积肥的经验，领导群众制定长期的积肥计划，纠正把积肥工作当作临时突击任务，“一轰而起、一轰而散”的作法。
    细菌肥料和颗粒肥料的增产效果很大，成本很低，各地试用已著成效。今年许多地区扩大了使用这些肥料的范围，这是很好的现象。这些地区应该总结农民使用这些肥料的经验，找出使用适时、增产显著的具体事例，向农民进一步宣传这种肥料的有效作用，争取进一步推广开来。
