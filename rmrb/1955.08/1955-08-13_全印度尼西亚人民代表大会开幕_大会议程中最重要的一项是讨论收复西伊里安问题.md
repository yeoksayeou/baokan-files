Xinhua News Agency. The All-Indonesia People's Congress opened on the evening of the 10th in the public assembly hall in Jakarta. More than 700 delegates elected from various regions, representatives of various parties and mass organizations, and many prominent social figures attended the conference, including Ali Sastroamidjojo, Zainal Arifin, and other resigned ministers, as well as senior army officers.

Sitting on the rostrum were the Chairman of the Congress, Arudji Kartawinata, and members of the All-Indonesia People's Congress Committee, including Djapari, the Director of the Indonesian West Irian Bureau, Professor Priyono, the recipient of the Stalin International Prize "For Strengthening International Peace," and Aidit, the General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party.

Kartawinata delivered the opening speech, saying that convening the People's Congress, as suggested by President Sukarno in December last year and supported by the people, was the voice of the people nationwide because the Indonesian nation was facing a crisis. He said that the Round Table Conference Agreement, the Dutch occupation of West Irian, and the economic relations between the Netherlands and Indonesia all violated the spirit of national independence.

He said that this congress was a concrete manifestation of the awakening of the Indonesian people. The holding of this congress is for the consolidation of the country. It shows the determination of the Indonesian people to complete their national revolution. He said that the tenth anniversary of Indonesian independence should become the beginning of a new era in Indonesian history.

The most important item on the agenda of the congress is the discussion of the West Irian issue. Delegates pointed out that it is necessary to unite the strength of the people nationwide to fight for the liberation of West Irian and its incorporation into the Republic of Indonesia.

The congress will also discuss foreign policy issues. Many delegates who spoke at the congress on the 10th advocated strengthening the friendship of the people of all countries and realizing the principles announced by the Asian-African Conference.

According to the agenda of the seven-day congress, the issue of striving for the recovery of West Irian will be discussed from the perspectives of culture, economy, diplomacy, and internal strength, with preliminary opinions provided by the resigned ministers Mohammed Yamin, Rusino, Sunarjo, and Colonel Bambang Sugeng, respectively.

    全印度尼西亚人民代表大会开幕
    大会议程中最重要的一项是讨论收复西伊里安问题
    据新华社讯　全印度尼西亚人民代表大会十日晚在雅加达的公众会议厅开幕。参加大会的有七百多名由各地区选举出来的代表，各党派和群众组织的代表，以及许多社会知名人士，其中包括阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约、蔡纳·阿里芬和其他已辞职的部长们以及高级陆军军官。
    坐在主席台上的有大会主席阿鲁齐·卡塔韦纳塔和全印度尼西亚人民代表大会委员会委员们，其中包括印度尼西亚西伊里安局局长迪亚帕里，“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人普里约诺教授，印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地等人。
    卡塔韦纳塔致开幕词说，召开苏加诺总统在去年十二月间所建议的并且获得人民支持的人民代表大会是全国人民的呼声，因为印度尼西亚国家面临着危机。他说，圆桌会议协定、荷兰对西伊里安的占领以及荷兰和印度尼西亚之间的经济关系都是违反民族独立的精神的。
    他说，这次大会是印度尼西亚全国人民的觉醒的具体表现。举行这次大会是为了国家的巩固。它表明印度尼西亚人民决心完成他们的民族革命。他说，印度尼西亚独立十周年纪念日应该成为在印度尼西亚历史上的新纪元的开端。
    大会的议程中最重要的一项是讨论西伊里安问题。代表们指出，必须团结全国人民的力量为解放西伊里安并且使它归并于印度尼西亚共和国而斗争。
    大会也将讨论外交政策问题。在十日大会上发言的许多代表都主张加强各国人民的友谊和实现亚非会议所宣布的原则。
    根据将举行七天的大会的议程，将从文化、经济、外交和内部实力的观点来讨论争取收复西伊里安问题，并且由已辞职的部长穆罕默德·雅明、罗西诺、苏纳约和班邦·苏甘上校分别提供初步意见。
