Xinhua News Agency, Rome dispatch, August 30th: According to TASS reports, the semi-official Ansa News Agency has confirmed the decision by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization military command to transfer US troops stationed in Austria to Italy. Ansa News Agency stated that the deployment of these troops "will be an action taken to implement Article 3 of the North Atlantic Treaty."

The Italian government's agreement to allow the transfer of foreign troops into Italy has been condemned by the Italian people. Communist Party parliamentarian Pajetta, during the debate in the Chamber of Deputies on the 1955-56 Defense Ministry budget, said that the entry of American troops into Italy strengthens and expands foreign military bases on Italian territory. Pajetta said that the entry of foreign troops into Italy is of an extremely serious and disturbing nature, because it is being carried out immediately after the conclusion of the Geneva Conference.

In Livorno, which may become the stationing site for American troops, people have held mass rallies and passed resolutions demanding the removal of this military base. These resolutions have been submitted to the President of the Republic. Protest rallies have also been held in San Severo, Cirignola, Apricena, San Nicandro, Ischitella, and other cities in Foggia province.

The Peace Committee of Ancona province telegraphed the President of the Republic, requesting him to prevent this "serious unconstitutional act" of agreeing to foreign troops being stationed in Italy. The Peace Committee of Bologna province also submitted similar requests to the President and the Speakers of both houses of Parliament.

"l'Unità", "Avanti!", "Il Paese" and other progressive newspapers have protested against the entry of American troops into Italy.

    意人民和舆论抗议驻奥美军调驻意大利
    新华社三十日讯　据塔斯社罗马消息：北大西洋联盟军事司令部决定把驻奥美军调到意大利的消息已经得到半官方安莎通讯社的证实。安莎通讯社说，这些军队的调防“将作为执行北大西洋公约第三条的行动”。
    意大利政府同意把外国军队调入意大利这件事，遭到了意大利人民的谴责。共产党议员巴叶塔在下议院辩论一九五五—五六年国防部预算时说，美国军队调入意大利使意大利领土上的外国军事基地加强和扩大。巴叶塔说，外国军队的调入意大利具有极其严重和使人不安的性质，因为这是在日内瓦会议结束之后立刻进行的。
    在可能成为美军驻地的里窝那，人们纷纷举行群众大会，通过了决议，要求取消这个军事基地。这些决议已送交共和国总统。福查省圣塞维罗、西里诺拉、亚普里塞拉、圣尼坎德罗、伊斯基特拉和其他城市也举行了抗议集会。
    安科纳省和平委员会打电报给共和国总统，要求他阻止同意外国军队驻在意大利这种“严重的违宪行为”。波伦亚省和平委员会也向总统和议会两院议长提出了类似的请求。
    “团结报”、“前进报”、“国家报”及其他进步报纸都对美军调入意大利表示抗议。
