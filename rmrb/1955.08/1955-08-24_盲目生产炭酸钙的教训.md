Lessons from Blind Production of Calcium Carbonate
Li Jun, Deputy Director of the Jilin Provincial Department of Industry

Last year, local state-owned industries in Jilin Province successfully trial-produced a total of 206 new products. At that time, when the production, supply, and sales of local state-owned industries were uncoordinated, this played a role in fully utilizing existing production capacity to develop production and supply market needs. However, because some comrades treated the new product manufacturing work with enthusiasm only, and did not realize the complexity of this work, it caused a lot of losses and mistakes. The failure of the Jilin Provincial Sugar Factory in manufacturing calcium carbonate is a typical example.

Last year, the Jilin Provincial Sugar Factory extended its shutdown time due to insufficient supply of sugar beets. At that time, the enterprise leaders saw that the market demand for calcium carbonate was exceeding supply, so they proposed to use some of the sugar-making equipment to produce calcium carbonate.

The technical personnel conducted experiments based on this opinion, proving that the problem was not significant; only the calcium carbonate drying problem was not fundamentally solved. It was estimated that adding some drying equipment could achieve the ideal goal. Therefore, they proposed a design task to build equipment that could dry 30 tons of calcium carbonate every 24 hours. However, in the middle of the design process, the technical personnel did not humbly listen to the opinions of fraternal factories and felt that the drying technology of calcium carbonate was very simple. They only designed according to general drying theories. As a result, after spending 200,000 yuan in investment to complete the calcium carbonate drying equipment and put it into production, the drying efficiency was far from reaching the originally expected capacity. The original estimated cost of each ton of calcium carbonate was only 138 yuan, but the actual cost was as high as 311 yuan. Thus, not only was the production plan not completed, but there was also a loss of more than 23,600 yuan. In particular, because the actual needs of the market were not clearly understood when the initial decision to produce calcium carbonate was made, only a temporary false phenomenon was used as a basis, and it was believed that the supply was not meeting the demand. It was not until the national balance was made this year that it was known that calcium carbonate was not only not lacking, but was actually overproduced. In this way, although technical improvements could be made to reduce the cost, because it was already an oversupplied product, the state naturally had no need to reinvest in the reconstruction of the equipment. Moreover, according to the characteristics of the technical process of the calcium carbonate product itself, it is also very unreasonable to use complex sugar-making equipment for production. At this point, the production of calcium carbonate had to be stopped because it no longer possessed the conditions to continue production.

There are many more lessons similar to the calcium carbonate incident. For example, the syringes trial-produced by the provincial public-private joint venture glass factory were trial-produced by "drawing a gourd according to its shape" without any basis in the product's technical performance. After being put into production, it was discovered that the quality did not meet the specifications and production was forced to stop. The provincial ceramics factory and the factories in Jilin and Changchun that produced particleboard blindly rebuilt and expanded because they saw a temporary need in the market. As a result, after being put into production, it was discovered that the market did not need it, and the rebuilt and expanded equipment had to be idled. There are also some enterprises that are satisfied with the effectiveness of laboratory trials, but do not consider the complexity of factory production. As a result, although the trial production was successful, it could not be put into production because it did not have the technical conditions for factory production. For example, the provincial public-private joint venture glass factory successfully trial-produced thermometers, so it added workers and equipment to prepare for mass production; but because the safety technology problem of mercury poisoning could not be solved, it was forced to stop production.

The above facts tell us that we must strengthen the unified leadership of the trial production of new products in local industries, and we must fully understand the market needs and the equipment and technical conditions of each enterprise, and organize the trial production of new products in a planned way. In the process of trial production, we must seriously study and research technology and master the characteristics of the technological process of new products. Only by seriously accepting the lessons of the past can we overcome the blindness in deciding to trial-produce new products and in the process of trial-producing new products, and avoid wasting manpower and financial resources.

　　盲目生产炭酸钙的教训
　　吉林省工业厅副厅长　黎浚
    吉林省地方国营工业去年共试制成功了二百零六种新产品，这在当时地方国营工业产供销不协调的情况下，对充分利用现有生产能力以发展生产，供应市场需要，是有作用的。但是，由于有些同志只凭热情去对待新产品制造工作，没有认识到这件工作的复杂性，因此造成了不少的损失和错误。吉林省制糖厂制造炭酸钙失败的事件，就是一个典型的例子。
    去年，吉林省制糖厂由于甜菜供应不足而延长了停工时间，当时企业领导人员看到市场上炭酸钙正供不应求，就提出利用部分制糖设备来生产炭酸钙。
    技术人员根据这个意见进行试验，证明问题不大；只是炭酸钙干燥问题没有根本解决，估计增添一些干燥设备，就可以达到理想的目的，因此便提出了增建每二十四小时能干燥三十吨炭酸钙设备的设计任务。但是，在设计中间，技术人员没有虚心听取兄弟工厂的意见，觉得炭酸钙的干燥技术简单得很，只按照一般的干燥理论进行了设计。结果花费了二十万元的投资，把炭酸钙干燥设备做成，投入生产以后，干燥效能远远达不到原来预计的能力。原预计每吨炭酸钙的成本只要一百三十八元，实际上却高达三百一十一元。这样，不仅完不成生产计划，还亏损了二万三千六百多元。特别是由于最初决定生产炭酸钙时，对市场上的实际需要没有摸清，只是根据一时的虚假现象，就认为是供不应求。到今年国家平衡时，才知道炭酸钙不但不缺少，而且生产得过多了。这样，虽然在技术上加以改进，还可以把成本降低一些，但因为已经是供过于求的产品，国家对这套设备当然没有再投资改建的必要。而且根据炭酸钙本身产品技术工艺的特点，利用复杂的制糖设备进行生产也很不合理。至此，炭酸钙的生产因为已不具备再继续生产的条件，只好被迫停止了。
    类似炭酸钙事件的教训还很多。如省属公私合营玻璃厂试制的注射器就是没有依据产品技术工艺性能而“比葫芦画瓢”试制的，投入生产后才发现质量不合规格而被迫停产。省陶瓷厂和吉林、长春两市生产刨花板的工厂，都是看到市场一时需要就盲目改建扩建，结果投入生产后，发现市场上并不需要，改建扩建的设备只好闲置起来。还有一些企业满足于试验室试制的成效，而没有考虑到工厂化生产的复杂性，结果试制虽然成功了，但因为不具备工厂化生产的技术条件，不能投入生产。如省公私合营玻璃厂试制体温计成功了，于是增添工人，增添设备，准备大量生产；但由于水银中毒安全技术问题解决不了，又被迫停产。
    以上这些事实告诉我们：必须加强对地方工业新产品试制工作的统一领导，必须充分摸清市场需要和各企业的设备技术条件，有计划地组织新产品的试制工作。在试制过程中，要认真学习和研究技术，掌握新产品工艺技术的特点。只有这样认真地接受过去的教训，才能克服在决定试制新产品和在新产品试制过程中的盲目性，避免造成人力财力上的浪费。
