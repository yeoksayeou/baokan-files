    Pioneer of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway: Yin Bushi
    Recently, I visited the surveying and design personnel on the Yingtan-Xiamen railway line. Here, people respectfully praise the surveying and design personnel as "pioneers."
    Every morning, when the mountains are still shrouded in heavy fog, the surveying and design personnel carry their instruments, rulers, and water bottles to work in the field. They spend the whole day traveling between mountains and rivers, often venturing into large forests and traversing dense thickets, their clothes soaked through with sweat. During their lunch breaks, they often take turns eating and rarely stop working. At night, they calculate the day's measurements, regardless of fatigue. When the line group led by Communist Party member Lang Yixiang of the Second Detachment was surveying in a certain valley, they encountered many difficulties. The mountains here are so high they touch the clouds, with many cliffs and steep walls, beneath which flow rapid rivers, and the dense trees block out the sky, making observation and tape measurements nearly impossible. Once, Lang Yixiang led everyone to climb the mountain and cut down the trees obstructing the measurements one by one. Then, Communist Youth League members Wu Xianfu and Li Yingjun tied a strap to a large tree and hung themselves from a cliff thirty meters above the ground to take tape measurements. After repeatedly pulling the tape for half an hour in the high altitude, they accurately measured this observation point.
    One evening, I visited the drilling team. Gu Baoding, the foreman and head of the No. 2 drilling rig crew, introduced their group's situation to me, saying, "Our group has a total of twenty-one people. The highest level of education is upper primary school, and the rest are lower primary school students. Except for me and another comrade, none of the others have operated a machine, or even seen such a new type of drilling rig. Since entering the Yingtan-Xiamen line for drilling, we have encountered many technical difficulties. Later, through teaching, doing, and learning, everyone worked actively and enthusiastically studied, and now four people have learned to operate the feed handle, two have learned to operate the internal combustion engine, two have learned to use water pumps, and we have also trained a recorder and three squad leaders." In these days, the crew led by Gu Baoding, due to frequently holding production research meetings to study and improve technology, prevented accidents and ensured quality, and exceeded the production target ahead of schedule every month. When drilling a certain tunnel, one day, the third shift drilled 3.88 meters into Grade 8 granite in eight hours, exceeding the national quota by more than one and a half times.
    In the office building of the engineering design department, I met Lu Guangyu, a second-class advanced worker, fifty years old. Lu Guangyu is an experienced senior engineer. While in charge of the fixed measurement project for a 40-kilometer section of the Yingtan-Xiamen line, he led other engineers to climb high mountains and cross large rivers many times to conduct surveys and research. He discovered that the topography of the original preliminary survey line was chaotic and complex, so he suggested re-selecting the line. As a result, six tunnels and two large bridges were reduced, and the line was shortened by 4 kilometers and 400 meters, saving the country a large amount of engineering investment.
    I also visited young technician Liu Hui. During the preliminary survey work for a certain section of the Yingtan-Xiamen line, Liu Hui discovered that the geological conditions of a section of about 400 meters of the original line were very poor, and subsidence accidents might occur after the railway was laid, so the line had to be changed. He went to the site again and again to observe the terrain and calculate the length of the line, and he also actively studied relevant books on line selection and design to enrich his knowledge. In order to select a more economical line than the original line, he also consulted local farmers and finally found a line with good geology and low cost in the intricate mountains. This new line also required 350 meters less tunneling and one less bridge than the original line, saving the country construction costs. Liu Hui was therefore rated as a second-class advanced worker.

    鹰厦铁路的开路先锋殷步实
    最近，我访问了鹰（潭）厦（门）铁路线上的勘测设计人员。在这里，人们都怀着尊敬的心情把勘测设计人员称誉为“开路先锋”。
    每天清晨，当大雾还笼罩着山岭的时候，勘测设计人员就扛着仪器、背着标尺、水壶到野外去工作。他们整天奔波在山河之间，常常钻进大森林，穿过深草树丛，衣裳打得透湿。他们在中午休息时，常常是轮流换班吃饭，也很少停止工作。夜晚他们还不顾疲劳地计算当天测量的结果。二分队共产党员郎彝祥所领导的线组在某山谷测量时，碰到了很多困难。这里的山高入云霄，很多悬崖陡壁，下面是急湍的河流，再加上遮天蔽日的树木，简直没有办法进行观察和拉尺。有一次，郎彝祥领导大家爬到山上，把妨碍测量的树木一棵棵砍倒。接着，青年团员吴先福和李英俊把绑带捆在一棵大树上，将自己吊在离地三十多公尺的悬崖上进行拉尺。在高空中经过半小时反复拉尺，才准确地测完这个观察点。
    一天傍晚，我去访问钻探队。领工员兼二号钻探机组长顾宝鼎向我介绍他们小组的情况说：“我们小组共有二十一人，文化水平最高的是高小程度，其余的人是初小学生。除了我和另外一个同志外，其余的人都没有操纵过机器，甚至没有看见过这样新式的钻探机。从进入鹰厦线钻探以来，我们在技术上碰到了许多困难，后来经过边教、边做、边学，大家积极劳动，热心钻研，现在已有四人学会操纵给进把，两人学会开内燃机，两人学会使用水泵，另外还培养出一个记录员和三个班长。”在这些日子里，顾宝鼎所领导的机组，由于经常召开生产研究会研究改进技术，防止了事故，保证了质量，每月都能提前超额完成生产任务。在钻探某隧道时，有一天，三班在八小时钻进了八级花岗岩三点八八公尺，超过国家规定定额一倍半以上。
    在工程设计部门的办公大楼，我会见了二等先进工作者、五十岁的逯光宇。逯光宇是一位具有丰富经验的老工程师。他在担任鹰厦线某段四十公里的定测工程中，曾经带领其他工程师多次登高山、渡大河，进行勘查研究，发现原草测线路地形零乱复杂，就建议把线路重新选定，结果减少隧道六座，减少大桥二座，缩短线路四公里零四百公尺，为国家节约了大量的工程投资。
    我还访问了青年技术员刘会。在鹰厦线某段初测工作中，刘会发现原线约有四百公尺的一段地质条件很不好，铺设铁路后可能产生塌陷事故，必须改线。他便一次又一次翻山越岭到现场观察地形，计算线路的长短，他又积极学习有关选线设计的书籍来充实自己的知识。为了选择一条比原线更经济的线路，他还向当地农民请教，终于在错综复杂的山峦中找到了一条地质好、花钱少的线路。这条新线路还比原线少修三百五十公尺隧道和一座桥梁，为国家节省了工程修建费。刘会因此被评为二等先进工作者。　（新华社）
