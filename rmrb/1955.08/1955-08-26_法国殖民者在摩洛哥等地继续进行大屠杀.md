Xinhua News Agency, August 25th: Casablanca dispatch: French colonialists concentrated thousands of Foreign Legionnaires, Marines, and paratroopers, and continued a large-scale military offensive in central Morocco on the 24th. French troops entered the Middle Atlas Mountains from the Oud Cheme, Khenifra, and Ait-Tamal regions, searching for Moroccan tribes supporting former Sultan Yusuf. They committed mass killings along the way during the search operation.

The Paris newspaper "Le Figaro" reported that French troops killed and wounded 200 residents in Khenifra. In Khouribga, 55 people were killed. According to United Press, in Ait-Tamal, the French troops left nothing alive wherever they went. In addition to killing everyone they encountered, the French troops also killed all the sheep, chickens, rabbits, cats, and dogs they came across.

In Algeria, French colonial troops arrested 110 Algerians in Sidi Mabrouk, near Constantine, in one instance. In an Arab village, because the young men had already left, the French troops killed the remaining 50 elderly people, women, and children.

Throughout North Africa, according to United Press, the French authorities have ordered French troops carrying out military suppression operations to shoot first and then question local residents. Some French troops shot local people who resisted French colonialism after capturing them. French troops also shot arrested Moroccans in concentration camps.

The bloody suppression by the French colonialists has aroused more fierce resistance from the people of North Africa. In eastern Algeria, attacks by the Algerian People's Armed Forces against French troops are constantly occurring. On the 23rd, Algerian People's guerrillas attacked the city of Gastonville. In Morocco, Berber tribal forces bravely resisted French troops. According to United Press, French troops "must be very vigilant" when advancing in rugged mountainous areas to prevent "being ambushed."

Currently, the French government is constantly increasing the number of colonial troops in North Africa to further suppress the resisting local people. The French government announced on the 24th an order to recall 60,000 reservists to be sent to North Africa. On the same day, French Deputy Minister of the Interior Thomas announced that six battalions of troops would be immediately sent to Algeria.
