　　A Growing Dike Production Cooperative
　　In late May, our Ministry of Water Resources survey team set out from Lugou Bridge to survey the dikes along the left bank of the Yongding River. On the dike, everything appeared to be in good order: two rows of neat willows interspersed among larger willows, and rows of purple-flowered pagoda trees (a type of shrub that protects the dike body) planted on the dike top. Every few miles along the dike there was a flood control workshop, and key areas also had stockpiles of grass sacks, reeds, and other flood control materials. Looking from the willow rows towards the riverbank, one could see the sturdy fascine dams and earth-stone dams built in previous years, as well as the permeable dams and stone dams newly built this year. Flood control team members were searching the dike for hidden dangers, and telephone operators were erecting flood control telephone lines along the dike... All of this told people that although the rainy season in North China would not arrive until after mid-July, this section of the dike was already making preparations for flood control.
　　The director of the Water Conservancy Section of Daxing County, who accompanied us on the survey, told us that the people currently active on and below this dike are the members of the growing Dike Production Cooperative of Daxing County, Hebei Province.
　　The Dike Production Cooperative was organized starting in the winter of 1953, and now has 140 members. At that time, this section of the dike was severely damaged by the flood, and needed to be repaired after the flood season. At the same time, because the land inside the dike was washed away by the water, and the land outside the dike was alkalized, the lives of the river workers were also affected. Therefore, with the approval of higher authorities, this Dike Production Cooperative (then called the Dike Construction Cooperative) was organized, directly under the leadership of the County Water Conservancy Section.
　　In the beginning, the members only did dike construction work. In this way, the income from the dike project was not enough to maintain the lives of the members, especially when there was no dike project to do, the lives of the members were even more affected. Therefore, during the winter slack season of 1954, the cooperative was reorganized, absorbing some old river workers from the villages along the dike with experience in flood control, and the surplus labor force in the countryside, and was reorganized into the current “Dike Production Cooperative”. The cooperative had sufficient labor, and there were large areas of barren wetlands, alkaline land, and ponds along the dike slope, which could be developed into paddy fields. Based on these conditions, the cooperative clearly put forward the policy of "serving the dike first, combined with the development of agricultural production" (all agricultural income belongs to the members). In this way, the lives of the members were guaranteed, and their enthusiasm for labor was very high. This year, the members have reclaimed more than 100 mu of paddy fields on the barren land outside the dike (which will be greatly developed next year), planted 300 mu of dry land, and also planted apple trees and willows as sideline production.
　　The Dike Production Cooperative has six sections in total: finance, safety and hygiene, forestry, engineering, agriculture, and storage. During the day, the members work in their respective units, and after returning to the cooperative at night, they report and discuss the work they have done that day, and evaluate their work and calculate points; the settlement is made once a quarter, more work more pay, less work less pay.
　　Because the Dike Production Cooperative inspects and maintains the dike all year round, and repairs the project at any time, the work does not appear particularly tense when the flood season arrives; even when there is an emergency with the water situation and dangerous works occur, it can concentrate manpower and materials to invest in rescue at any time, without being caught off guard. During the winter slack season, the members weave soil baskets, make straw ropes, and tie grass sacks. In this way, the dike management costs and the funds for flood control materials can be gradually reduced, and a group of technical talents for rescue and dike protection can be cultivated and trained.
　　I believe that this kind of Dike Production Cooperative can be tried in places along the river where there is barren land.

### 一个成长中的堤防生产合作社

　　一个成长中的堤防生产合作社
    五月下旬，我们水利部查勘小组从芦沟桥出发，沿着永定河左岸查勘堤防。堤上，一切都显得井井有序：两排整齐的?柳夹杂在大柳中间，堤顶上种着一行行正在开花的紫蕊槐（一种保护堤身的灌木）。大堤上每隔几里地有一个防汛用的工房，重点地带还堆存着草袋、芦苇等防汛物料。由柳行中向河岸看去，可以见到往年修建而现在还很坚固的埽坝、土石坝，和今年新修的透水坝、石坝等。防汛队员们正在堤上寻找着隐患，电话员正在沿堤架设着防汛电话线……。这一切都告诉人们：虽然华北的雨季在七月中旬以后才到来，但当时这一段堤防已在作着防汛的准备工作了。
    陪同我们一道查勘的大兴县水利科长告诉我们，目前活跃在这堤防上和堤防下的人们，就是正在成长着的河北省大兴县堤防生产合作社的社员们。
    堤防生产合作社是由一九五三年冬季开始组织的，现在已有社员一百四十人。当时，这段堤防被大水破坏得很严重，汛后必须重新修整。同时，由于大水以后堤内的地被水冲了，堤外的地也遭碱化，河工的生活也受到了影响。因此，经上级批准，组织了这个堤防生产合作社（当时叫作堤防建设合作社），直接由县水利科领导。
    开始的时候，社员们光做修筑堤防的活。这样，堤防工程费的收入不够维持社员们的生活，尤其在没有堤防工程可做的时候社员生活更要受到影响。因此在一九五四年冬闲时间，合作社进行了整顿，吸收了一些沿堤各村对防汛有经验的老河工和农村中的剩余劳动力，改组成为现在的
  “堤防生产合作社”。社里有了充足的劳动力，沿堤坡下又有大片荒芜着的湿地、碱地和池塘，可以发展水田。根据这些条件，明确提出了“以服务堤防为主，结合发展农业生产”（农业收入，全部归社员所有）的方针。这样，社员们生活有了保障，因而劳动热情很高。今年社员们在堤外荒地上开垦了水田一百多亩（明年将大大发展），种着旱地三百亩，还栽了苹果树和?柳，作为副业生产。
    堤防生产合作社共设财务、安全卫生、林木、工程、农业、保管等六股，社员白天分别在所属的单位进行工作，晚上回社后根据自己当天所做的工作，自报公议，评工计分；每季结算一次，多劳多得，少劳少得。
    由于堤防生产合作社常年巡视养护堤防，随时培修工程，汛期到来的时候，工作并不显得特别紧张；即使遇到水情紧急有险工发生，也能够随时集中人力、物料投入抢险，不致措手不及。冬闲时社员们编织土筐，打草绳，结草袋。这样，就可逐渐减轻堤防管理费用和防汛备料的资金，并可培养训练出一批抢险护堤的技术人材。
    我认为，这种堤防生产合作社在沿河有荒地的地方可以试办。　李纪生
