Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 15th: According to "Laos News," in the battle on August 5th where Lao fighting units repelled the Kingdom government army's attack on Na Kieng, southeast of Muong Phen, they seized the military offensive plan formulated by Major Sang, the military commander of the Kingdom government's armed forces illegally stationed in Sam Neua Province, and Wu Dong, deputy commander of the Kingdom government's First Parachute Battalion, under orders from the Kingdom government.

This plan intends to attack the Lao fighting units in the Na Sui, Ban Chang, Na Xing, Ba Ka, Gu Hai, Na Sa Mong, Hui He and other areas southeast of Muong Phen, and occupy these areas as a springboard for continuing the offensive against the Lao fighting units and expanding the war.

The plan reveals that some units of the Kingdom government army stationed in the border area of Sam Neua have also been ordered to prepare to go to Muong Phen to provide support. At the same time, the Kingdom government army stationed in Ba Ti, Hui Ya and other places has also received orders to go to the west of Sam Neua, actively operate, and attack the Lao fighting units.

In order to realize this plan, the Kingdom government army has launched two offensives against the Lao fighting units on August 5th and 7th. At the same time, in coordination with the above-mentioned military offensive conspiracy, the Kingdom government delegation delayed the two political meetings originally scheduled for August 8th and August 10th, and prepared to resume the meetings on August 12th.

"Laos News" pointed out: This plan exposes the Kingdom government's conspiracy to the Lao people and the people of the world. They are following the orders of imperialism and intend to expand the military offensive against Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces in an attempt to eliminate the Lao fighting units.

    寮国战斗部队在芒奔附近的战斗中
    缴获老挝王国军队进犯计划
    新华社河内十五日电　据“寮国新闻”消息，寮国战斗部队在八月五日击退王国政府军队进攻芒奔东南的那经的战斗中，缴获了非法驻扎在桑怒省的王国政府武装部队的军事指挥官桑少校和王国政府第一伞兵营副指挥吴东奉王国政府之命制定的军事进攻计划。
    这个计划打算进攻芒奔东南的那绥、班敞、那馨、巴卡、古海、那萨蒙、会合等地区的寮国战斗部队，占领这些地区以便作为继续进攻寮国战斗部队和扩大战事的跳板。
    这个计划透露，王国政府军队驻在桑怒边界地区的一些单位也得到命令要准备开到芒奔予以支援。同时驻扎在巴梯、会雅等地的王国政府军队也接到命令要开往桑怒西面，积极活动，并且进攻寮国战斗部队。
    为了实现这个计划，王国政府军队已经在八月五日和七日对寮国战斗部队发动了两次进攻。同时，王国政府代表团为配合上述的军事进攻阴谋，拖延了原定在八月八日和八月十日举行的两次政治会议，准备到八月十二日才重新举行会议。
    “寮国新闻”指出：这个计划向老挝人民和世界人民揭露了王国政府的阴谋，他们正在奉行帝国主义的命令，打算扩大对桑怒和丰沙里两省的军事进攻，企图消灭寮国战斗部队。
