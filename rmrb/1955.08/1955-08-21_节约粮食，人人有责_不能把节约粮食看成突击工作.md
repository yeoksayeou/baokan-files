Saving Food is Everyone's Responsibility
We Cannot Treat Saving Food as a Crash Campaign
To the Editor:
　　It is vitally important that those in charge of each unit personally grasp the unit's grain consumption, which is key to making a sound grain consumption plan. In August, the heads of some units in Beijing relaxed this work, resulting in an overly high grain consumption plan for employees.

　　The average grain consumption for employees of the Beijing State-Owned Milk Station was 39 catties per person in June, with a plan for 40 catties per person in July, but the August plan rose to 52 catties per person. How could such a grain plan be submitted? It turns out that the director of the Milk Station (who is also the party branch secretary) not only failed to review the employee grain consumption plan but also used being busy as an excuse not to educate everyone about the importance of saving grain. The director himself has his formal household registration at home, but he subscribes to the grain consumption plan in the unit's mess hall. When the work team raised this issue with him, he actually said, "Don't make such a fuss!"

　　The Beijing Education Bureau averaged 25.5 catties of grain per person in July, but the August plan increased by an average of 7 catties per person. The reason is that the responsible comrades of the Education Bureau did not review the August grain consumption plan at all but merely relied on self-reporting from everyone and then summarized and reported it.

　　The leading personnel of the Ministry of Fuel Industry's Electric Power Administration Bureau also did not pay enough attention to the work of compiling the grain consumption plan. The food administrator of this administration said, "The leaders are too busy. Currently, there are three major tasks that take precedence over grain work, so they can only sign the grain plan and cannot check it." As a result, the reported grain consumption plan averaged 34 catties and 14 taels per person, while 29 catties would actually be enough.

　　Saving grain is a long-term task, not a crash campaign. Therefore, the heads of each unit must always pay attention to grasping the grain consumption situation of their units and must not simply deal with it temporarily and then ignore it. If this happens, there will be adverse phenomena such as high grain consumption plans and waste of grain. The above examples are worth learning from.

### 节约粮食，人人有责　不能把节约粮食看成突击工作

　　节约粮食，人人有责
　　不能把节约粮食看成突击工作编辑同志：
    各单位负责人亲自掌握本单位的用粮情况，是订好用粮计划的一个重要关键。北京市有些单位的负责人在八月份放松了这一项工作，因而又出现了职工用粮计划偏高的现象。
    北京国营牛奶站职工，在六月份每人平均吃粮三十九斤，七月份计划是每人四十斤，但八月份的计划中却上升为每人五十二斤。这样的粮食计划怎么能够报上来呢？原来牛奶站的主任（兼党支部书记）不但没有审核职工的用粮计划，而且借口工作忙，根本没有向大家宣传节约粮食的意义。这个主任自己的正式户口在家里，却在本单位膳团里订用粮计划。工作组向他提出意见时，他竟说：“不要太麻烦了！”
    北京市教育局七月份每人平均吃粮二十五斤半，八月份计划平均每人却增加了七斤。原因是教育局的负责同志根本没有审核八月份的吃粮计划，仅仅是凭大家自报，然后就汇总上报了。
    燃料工业部电业管理总局，领导人员对编造用粮计划的工作也很不重视。这个管理局的伙食管理员说：“首长太忙，目前有三大工作都在粮食工作之上，所以对粮食计划只能管盖章，不能管检查。”结果上报的用粮计划平均每人是三十四斤十四两，实际上二十九斤也就够了。
    节约粮食是个长期性的工作，而不是一个突击性的运动。因此，各单位的负责人必须经常重视掌握本单位的用粮情况，决不能临时抓一把以后就不过问了。如果这样，就会出现用粮计划偏高和浪费粮食等不良现象。以上几个事例，值得作为教训。
