Title: Design Estimates Should Be Compiled and Reviewed with a Serious Attitude

The First Design Branch of the First Design Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building adopted such an erroneous attitude when cooperating on the design of a certain ball bearing factory. Fortunately, it was discovered and corrected by the leading authorities in time, otherwise, a large amount of state funds would have been wasted and accumulated before the project even started. During the first Five-Year Plan, many projects are being or will be compiled with design estimates. All relevant design units must learn from the lessons of the First Design Branch of the First Design Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building and resolutely prevent a careless and rash attitude towards design estimates.

Independent expenses (also called other expenses) in design estimates should generally only account for 15% or less of the total design estimate, but the First Design Branch actually compiled the independent expenses to account for more than 20% of the total estimate. For example, when compiling the production preparation cost estimate, they even included the cost of materials, labor wages, and power costs for production and trial production of new products, which belonged to the production expenses. When compiling the winter construction cost estimate, they mechanically applied the Soviet data on winter construction costs, without considering that the climate in the Soviet Union is much colder than the factory's location, and the winter construction time is also longer than in our country. As a result, the compiled estimate reached 540,000 yuan. After review and calculation by the higher authorities, it was found that only 104,000 yuan was actually needed.

Some cost estimating personnel of the First Design Branch regarded the work of compiling estimates as a simple statistical and summary task. They did not carefully study the information provided by relevant parties and blindly included it in the estimate. For example, the ball bearing factory once proposed that all workers in the factory should receive two years of training before production, requiring a training cost of 7.69 million yuan. The cost estimating personnel did not further investigate whether all workers in the factory needed to be trained for two years, or how much this cost was higher than the indicators of other factories, and included it all in the estimate. After review, it was found that more than 2.6 million yuan could be reduced.

The leading staff of the First Design Branch and the budget section responsible for this work did not carefully review all the compiled estimates. When they found that the estimate exceeded the state-controlled investment figures by a large margin, they did not carefully study the reasons for the excess and modify it in time, but submitted it to the First Ministry of Machine Building. It was not until after the relevant departments of the First Ministry of Machine Building reviewed it that they discovered the many unreasonable parts listed above. Removing these parts saved a total of more than 18 million yuan compared to the original estimate.

Design estimates are an important basis for the state to control the use of state investment by various construction units. Through design estimates, the state can further supervise various construction units and ensure the rational use of state funds. However, the leading staff of the First Design Branch and some personnel participating in the compilation of design estimates compiled a very wasteful design estimate.

    要以严肃的态度编制和审查设计概算
    曾润
    第一机械工业部设计总局第一设计分局在配合某滚珠轴承厂的设计时竟采取了这样错误的态度，幸而被领导机关及时发现和纠正了，否则将会使工程还没有开工就注定了要浪费、积压国家的大量资金。在第一个五年计划当中，有许多工程正在或将要编制设计概算，各个有关的设计单位要接受第一机械工业部设计总局第一设计分局的教训，切实防止对设计概算采取马虎轻率的态度。
    设计概算中的独立费用（也叫其他费用），一般应该只占总设计概算的百分之十五以下，但第一设计分局竟把独立费用编制得占总概算的百分之二十以上；再如在编制生产准备费概算时，竟把生产和试制新产品的材料费、人工工资和动力费用等属于生产开支费部分也打了进去。他们在编制冬季施工费的概算时，机械地套用苏联冬季施工费的资料，没有考虑到苏联的气候比这个工厂所在地冷得多，冬季施工的时间也比我国长，结果所编制的概算高达五十四万元。经过上级机关审查计算，实际上只需要十万四千元。
    第一设计分局某些编制概算的工作人员，把编制概算工作看成是简单的统计和汇总工作，对有关方面提供的资料，也不认真研究，就盲目地列入概算中。如滚珠轴承厂厂方曾提出全厂所有工人普遍要在生产前训练两年，需要培养费用七百六十九万元。编制概算的工作人员也没有进一步追究全厂所有工人是否都需要培训两年，这项费用与其他厂的指标相比高出多少，就全部列入概算中。经过审查，发现可以削减二百六十多万元。
    第一设计分局领导工作人员和负责这一工作的预算科对编出的全部概算并未认真审查，当发现这个概算超出国家控制的投资数字很多，但没有仔细研究超出的原因及时加以修改，就送交第一机械工业部了。直到经过第一机械工业部有关部门审查后，才发现以上列举的许多不合理部分。把这些部分去掉，较原概算共节省了一千八百多万元。
    设计概算是国家控制各建设单位使用国家投资的重要依据。通过设计概算，国家可以进一步对各建设单位实行监督，保证国家资金的合理使用。但是第一设计分局的领导工作人员和某些参加编制设计概算的工作人员，对编制设计概算编制了一个十分浪费的设计概算。
