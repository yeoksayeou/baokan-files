Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, August 21st: The International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy held its final plenary session on August 20th at the Palais des Nations in Geneva, according to TASS.

　　The conference heard a report by Soviet representative Professor Lavrishchev on Soviet assistance to other countries in the peaceful uses of atomic energy. In his report, he mentioned that the Soviet government is providing scientific, technical, and production assistance to the People's Republic of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary in establishing scientific experimental centers to develop research in nuclear physics and the peaceful uses of atomic energy.

　　Lavrishchev said that the Soviet Union considers assistance to other countries as a comprehensive set of measures that enable each country receiving assistance to develop its own research and investigation work in the peaceful uses of atomic energy in the future without relying on any other country.

　　Lavrishchev continued, according to the already concluded scientific and technical assistance agreements, the Soviet Union will design and build experimental atomic piles with a heat output of two thousand kilowatts and cyclotrons capable of obtaining particles with energy up to twenty-five million electron volts for Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and the German Democratic Republic. The design work for these atomic piles has already begun. The equipment provided by the Soviet Union will be complete, and all necessary tools and devices will be supplied by the Soviet Union for installation. Experts from the countries receiving the above-mentioned equipment will participate in the installation work. Soviet experts will help start up and put the atomic piles and accelerators into production, and will also help manage them.

　　Lavrishchev said that plans are currently being made to establish an experimental atomic reactor with a heat output of 6,500 kilowatts for the People's Republic of China. If necessary, the heat output of this reactor can be increased to 10,000 kilowatts. This reactor is operated with uranium rods containing 2% uranium-235. The deceleration of neutrons and the cooling of heat-releasing units are carried out by heavy water. The People's Republic of China is establishing a cyclotron of the above type.

　　Lavrishchev emphasized that the Soviet Union does not regard assistance in the use of atomic energy as a commercial undertaking. Although the Soviet Union has invested heavily in the development of atomic piles and accelerators, the necessary scientific and technical information and experience provided to other countries are free of charge. The above-mentioned countries only need to pay the actual cost of manufacturing the equipment that will be handed over to these countries in accordance with the agreement. The assistance provided by the Soviet Union to other countries opens up broad possibilities for the development of modern physics in those countries.

　　In his report, Lavrishchev finally reminded the conference that the Soviet government has stated that it is prepared to consider expanding the scope of countries to which the Soviet Union can provide assistance in the peaceful uses of atomic energy. The Soviet Union attaches great importance to expanding international scientific cooperation. Lavrishchev expressed the hope that such conferences should be held regularly in the future.

　　American representative Libby, in his report on international cooperation in atomic energy, emphasized the success of the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy. He expressed the hope that such conferences should also be held in the future to exchange achievements in atomic energy research.

　　The conference then proceeded with discussions, in which the representatives who spoke all expressed satisfaction with the success of the conference and emphasized the great significance of the conference's success for further developing international cooperation and strengthening trust between countries. They also expressed their support for holding such conferences in the future.

　　Yugoslav representative Savic read out a congratulatory telegram from Yugoslav President Tito to the conference. Tito especially pointed out that, due to the international significance of this conference, it has gone beyond the scope of a purely scientific conference and marks a new stage in the development of international cooperation.

　　Conference Chairman Bhabha briefly reviewed the issues discussed at the conference in his closing speech. He read out a congratulatory telegram from Soviet Premier Bulganin. He also informed the conference that the conference had also received congratulatory telegrams from U.S. President Eisenhower and Bulgarian Premier Chervenkov. Bhabha concluded by saying that after the conference, the delegates would return to their work of further using atomic energy for peaceful purposes. They can work with satisfaction because they have contributed to the success of the conference and are convinced that their work will be used to improve the lives of all men and women in all regions of the world.

　　Xinhua News Agency, August 21st: According to TASS, Geneva: The physics and reactor group, the chemistry, metallurgy, and technology group, and the radioactive isotope group of the International Scientific and Technical Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy all held their final meetings on August 20th. Reports on the theory of reactors were discussed at the physics and reactor group meeting. At the chemistry, metallurgy, and technology group meeting, reports on the problem of residual radioactive substances were discussed. Among the reports discussed at the radioactive isotope group meeting, the experimental report on the use of radioactive radiation to sterilize food and medicinal materials, as well as reports on the issue of directly converting radioactive radiation energy into electrical energy, were of particular interest.

　　Xinhua News Agency, August 21st: According to TASS, Geneva: The Soviet delegation attending the International Scientific and Technical Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy issued the following statement on August 20th:

　　"At the conclusion of the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, the Soviet delegation considers it necessary to point out that the conference was conducted in the atmosphere of cooperation and mutual understanding established by the Geneva Four-Power Summit, and this conference is an important step in establishing favorable personal contacts between scientists from various countries.

　　The Soviet delegation hopes that this conference will prove to be a valuable contribution to the development of broad scientific cooperation in using the great scientific discoveries of our time not for war and destruction, but for the benefit of mankind and to promote the development of civilization.

　　The Soviet delegation hopes that such conferences can be held regularly in the future."

　　和平利用原子能国际会议闭幕
　　苏联代表团就会议闭幕发表声明
    新华社二十一日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：八月二十日，和平利用原子能国际会议在日内瓦国联大厦举行最后一次全体会议。
    会议听取了苏联代表拉夫里谢夫教授所作的关于苏联在和平利用原子能方面给予其他国家的帮助的报告。他在报告中谈到在建立科学实验中心以发展核子物理学的研究和和平利用原子能方面，苏联政府正在给予中华人民共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和匈牙利以科学、技术和生产上的援助。
    拉夫里谢夫说，苏联认为，给予其他国家的帮助是一整套的措施，这些措施使接受援助的每一个国家能够在将来不依靠任何其他国家而发展它自己在和平利用原子能方面的研究和调查工作。
    拉夫里谢夫接着说，根据已经缔结的科学技术援助协定，苏联将为波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚和德意志民主共和国设计和建造具有两千瓩发热量的实验性原子堆和能获得高达二千五百万电子伏特的能量的粒子的回旋加速器。这些原子堆的设计工作已经开始。苏联给予的设备将是全套的，并且将由苏联供给全部必要的工具和装置来加以安装。接受上述设备的国家的专家们将参加安装工作。苏联专家将帮助使原子堆和加速器开动和投入生产，并且还将帮助管理它们。
