The harvest of more than 50 million mu of mid-season rice in Sichuan Province is proceeding intensely. Many areas have had another bumper harvest this year. Along the Yangtze River for more than 1,000 kilometers from Wushan in the east to Yibin in the west, the harvesting of medium-ripe rice is nearing completion, and news of good harvests is spreading everywhere. In Xinqiao Township, Bishan County, where the average grain output of the whole township increased by more than 6% compared with last year, five villages have already held harvest celebration evenings. More than 1,000 mu of rice in Tiantang Village, Haichao Township, Luxian County, increased production by nearly 10% compared with last year. The Xuguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Nanchong City and the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiang'an County harvested more than 50 jin of rice per mu this year on the same plot of land compared with last year. Hunan Province is expected to have a bumper harvest of more than 40 million mu of mid-season rice. The mid-season rice harvest on the Dongting Lake Plain, which has already begun, is estimated to increase by about 10% this year compared with the bumper year of 1953. The mid-season rice in the Xiangtan Special Zone in the Xiangjiang River Basin will also increase production compared with last year. In some areas of the Jianghan Plain in Hubei Province, the harvesting of mid-season rice has begun. It is estimated that the average yield of mid-season rice per mu in the province is more than 400 jin, which is about 20% more than in 1953. The mid-season rice in the areas that suffered from severe flooding last year is growing particularly well this year, with a yield of about 500 jin per mu. The mid-season rice in Anhui Province has large ears and plump grains, a scene not seen in more than ten years. It is estimated that the yield per mu will be 500 jin, which is 30% to 40% more than in the bumper year of 1952. The yield of mid-season rice in Jiangxi Province has also generally increased compared with last year.
