Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 11th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles openly expressed the United States' "sympathy" for the Syngman Rhee clique's rampant activities threatening the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission at a press conference in Washington on August 10th.

Referring to "the rising tide of indignation in Korea over the continued presence of Communist members of the inspection teams," Dulles said, "We have been aware of this sentiment for some time... We are sympathetic to this sentiment."

When asked whether the United States and South Korea had consulted on the Syngman Rhee clique's so-called "ultimatum" demanding that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission leave South Korea by a deadline, Dulles replied, "This whole question has been the subject of discussion over the past year or more."

Dulles stated: "Under the terms of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the United Nations Command has an obligation to protect the personnel of these teams. This is an obligation we expect to carry out, and we do not believe that the South Koreans should try to oppose this obligation by force as they now seem inclined to do." However, Dulles then added: "We are inclined to agree with the feeling of the Republic of Korea that this commission is not currently of any great use." Like the Syngman Rhee clique, Dulles groundlessly slandered the work of the Polish and Czechoslovak personnel in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

Dulles also said: "Many of the provisions [of the armistice agreement] seem to be outdated or impractical. However, how to change them is a rather difficult problem, and this is a problem we are considering very seriously." He added that he hoped "the South Koreans will continue to be patient."

Dulles gave a negative answer to the question of whether the United States agreed to the current division of Korea. He added that the division exists, and the United States certainly regrets this division, but "does not believe that the situation of division should be resolved by force." Dulles said that he believed that Korean unification could be achieved without resorting to war.

In answering a question about the Vietnamese general election, Dulles said that the United States supports Ngo Dinh Diem's position that elections for all of Vietnam cannot be held.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 11th: While supporting Syngman Rhee in launching atrocities against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the United States also convened an emergency meeting of representatives of countries participating in the Korean War in Washington on the 10th, asking them to jointly support the U.S. plan to sabotage the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

Sources revealed that at this special meeting, the U.S. authorities presented a "full report" to its "allies" on the atrocities of South Korea against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Just as U.S. Secretary of State Dulles publicly stated on the same day, the U.S. representative also expressed the United States' "sympathy" for the Syngman Rhee clique at the meeting.

According to Reuters, the "main topic of discussion at this sixteen-nation meeting was the same as in February of this year." It is known that the United States convened these countries in February with the aim of unilaterally disbanding the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and attempting to undermine the Korean armistice by means of slandering the Korean and Chinese sides for violating the armistice agreement.

    杜勒斯支持李承晚和吴庭艳的立场
    美国要参加侵朝战争国家支持破坏中立国监察委员会的计划
    新华社十一日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯八月十日在华盛顿记者招待会上公然表示美国“同情”李承晚集团威胁中立国监察委员会的猖狂活动。
    杜勒斯在提到“在韩国，对于视察小组的共产党组员继续留在那里的愤慨浪潮愈来愈高”以后说：“我们已经知道这种情绪有一些时候了。……我们是同情这种情绪的。”
    有人问到，对于李承晚集团发出所谓“最后通牒”要求中立国监察委员会限期离开南朝鲜这件事，美国和南朝鲜之间曾否进行过商量。杜勒斯回答说：“在过去一年或更长的时间里，这整个问题一直是讨论的对象。”
    杜勒斯表示：“根据朝鲜停战协定的条款，联合国军司令部有义务保护这些小组的人员。这是我们期望执行的一种义务，而且我们认为这种义务是南朝鲜人不应当像他们现在想要做的那样设法用武力来加以反对的。”但是，杜勒斯接着又说：“我们倾向于同意大韩民国的感觉，即这个委员会在目前并没有任何很大用处。”杜勒斯和李承晚集团一样对中立国监察委员会中波兰和捷克斯洛伐克人员的工作毫无根据地滥加诬蔑。
    杜勒斯还说：“（停战协定的）许多规定似乎已经过时或不切实际了。但是，怎样改变它们乃是一个相当困难的问题，这个问题我们正在非常认真地加以考虑。”他又说，希望“南朝鲜人将继续忍耐。”
    杜勒斯对美国是否同意目前朝鲜的分裂状态这个问题作了否定的回答。他补充说，分裂是存在的，美国当然对这种分裂表示惋惜，但是“并不认为分裂的局面应当借武力来解决”。杜勒斯说，他相信，可以不诉诸战争而达到朝鲜的统一。
    杜勒斯在回答关于越南普选的问题时说，美国支持吴庭艳的立场，认为全越南的选举不能举行。
    新华社十一日讯　华盛顿消息：美国在支持李承晚发动反对中立国监察委员会的暴行的同时，又在十日召集参加侵略朝鲜战争的各国代表在华盛顿举行紧急会议，要它们共同支持美国破坏中立国监察委员会的计划。
    消息透露，美国当局在这次特别会议上向它的“盟国”提出关于南朝鲜反对中立国监察委员会的暴行的“充分报告”。正像美国国务卿杜勒斯在同一天所公开表示的一样，美国代表也在会上表明美国对李承晚集团的“同情”。
    据路透社说，这次十六国会议“讨论的主要题目和今年二月相同”。大家知道，美国在二月间召集这些国家开会的目的也就是要片面解散中立国监察委员会，并且企图用诬蔑朝中方面违反停战协定的手段来危害朝鲜停战。
