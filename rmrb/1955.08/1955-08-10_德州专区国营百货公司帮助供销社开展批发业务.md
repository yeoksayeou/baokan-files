    State-owned Department Stores in Dezhou Prefecture Help Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Develop Wholesale Business
    Since May, thirteen state-owned department store wholesale units in Pingyuan, Linyi, De County, Wucheng, Shanghe, Xiajin and other areas of Dezhou Prefecture, Shandong Province, have transferred 46 business-savvy salespersons and adopted the method of "dedicated personnel for dedicated cooperatives, with division of labor to cover specific areas" to go deep into rural supply and marketing cooperatives to help them develop their wholesale business. The Qihe County Department Store Business Group sent personnel to help the Seventh District Supply and Marketing Cooperative establish a wholesale sales department, displaying more than 200 kinds of wholesale goods. At the same time, they helped this supply and marketing cooperative understand the ideological situation of small vendors, held a symposium for private merchants, and organized 32 small vendors to purchase goods from the supply and marketing cooperative. In early June, the Pingyuan County Department Store sent three salespersons carrying 108 kinds of goods that the supply and marketing cooperative did not have, to the Third District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, helping them hold a materials exhibition and exchange fair in Sujiaji, featuring 669 kinds of goods. Fifty-one local small vendors visited the fair, and transactions worth 1,932 yuan were concluded at the time. After the fair, the supply and marketing cooperative submitted a requisition plan to the department store for more than 19,300 yuan worth of goods to supply to small vendors.
    After the state-owned department stores helped develop the wholesale business, the wholesale volume of supply and marketing cooperatives in various places increased rapidly. For example, the wholesale volume of the Seventh District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Qihe County increased more than six times in May compared with April, and increased again in June compared with May. The business volume of the Dezhou Department Store system also generally increased, with sales in June increasing by more than 240,000 yuan compared with May. After the wholesale work of the supply and marketing cooperatives was strengthened, it also brought into play the enthusiasm of rural small vendors and better met the needs of farmers.

    德州专区国营百货公司帮助供销社开展批发业务
    山东省德州专区平原、临邑、德县、武城、商河、夏津等地的十三个国营百货公司批发单位，从五月份起抽调了四十六名熟悉业务的营业员，采用“专人专社，分工包片”的办法，深入到农村供销合作社，帮助开展批发业务。齐河县百货经营组派人帮助第七区供销合作社建立了批发门市部，陈列出二百多种批发商品；同时，帮助这个供销合作社了解了小商贩的思想情况，召开了私商座谈会，组织三十二户小商贩到供销合作社进货。平原县百货商店在六月上旬，派出三名营业员，携带一百零八种供销合作社没有的商品，到第三区供销合作社，帮助他们在苏家集举办了一个有六百六十九种商品的物资展览交流会。当地五十一户小商贩到会上参观，当时就成交一千九百三十二元；供销合作社在会后又向百货商店提出一万九千三百多元的要货计划供应小商贩。
    经过国营百货公司帮助开展批发业务，各地供销合作社的批发额都迅速增加。如齐河县第七区供销合作社五月份批发额，比四月份上升六倍以上，六月份又比五月份增加。德州百货公司系统的经营额也普遍增加了，六月份卖钱额比五月份增加二十四万多元；晏城百货经营组六月中旬的卖钱额比上旬增加百分之二百以上。供销合作社批发工作加强以后，也发挥了农村小商贩的积极性，更好地供应了农民的需要。（贾占升）
