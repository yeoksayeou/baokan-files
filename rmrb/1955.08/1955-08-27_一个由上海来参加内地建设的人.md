　　A Person from Shanghai Participating in Inland Construction
　　Wu Siceng　Hu Shixin
    The massive industrial construction in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, is attracting an increasing number of builders. Whether on the construction sites in full swing or in the newly built factories, workers from all over the country can be found everywhere. When these workers first arrived, they were unfamiliar with Xi'an, and many were unwilling to stay for a long time. But now, they have deeply fallen in love with this city. Zhu Genfu, a construction worker and model worker from the Third Engineering Company of the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau, is one of them.
    Zhu Genfu used to work at the East China Third Engineering Company. In early May of last year, the company mobilized workers to participate in industrial construction in the inland. At that time, some people said that life in the Northwest was hard, that they only ate baozi (people in East China call the steamed buns eaten by people in Xi'an "baozi"), and there was no rice to eat; some said that the Northwest was too cold, and their noses would freeze; some said they were afraid of not being acclimatized, and they would bring some mud from their hometown, and drink some mud soup from their hometown if they got sick! When Zhu Genfu heard these words, he also felt a little uneasy. However, when he thought of the instructions and encouragement given to them by the leaders of the Ministry of Construction Engineering at the first meeting of heroes and model representatives of the engineering troops of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering more than two months ago, his mind became clear. He thought, "Key construction projects are the lifeline of the country! I am a model worker, and in order to build the country, even if it is a little hard, I cannot hide behind!" So he applied to the organization: "Resolutely obey the organization's assignment and go to the place where the motherland needs me most."
    After Zhu Genfu was assigned to Xi'an, he was quickly attracted by the new construction scene. He saw that many factories had already been built here, including new-style power plants and cotton textile mills, many good hospitals, and many schools. With his eyes as a worker for more than 20 years, he knew at a glance at the wide cement roads: "These are roads that have only been built for two years!" He also heard comrades in Xi'an say: "The Hu Zongnan bandit gang carried out extremely cruel destruction and exploitation in Xi'an. If there was any construction, it was just the construction of many killing trenches and bunkers!" Zhu Genfu was so excited by what he saw and heard that he said to himself: "I'm late! I'm late! I must catch up."
    How to catch up? Zhu Genfu thought, "We must use advanced tools to speed up the construction progress!" The organization accepted his request and assigned him to work in the advanced tool research group of the timber processing plant.
    At the beginning of the work, it happened that the construction site needed a large number of doors and windows, but the workers were completely relying on hand-held axes to chop the "zengpian" (thin wooden pieces) used for making doors and windows, which not only failed to meet the quota, but also easily cut their hands if they were not careful. Seeing this situation, Zhu Genfu was very anxious and pondered day and night to create an advanced tool for manufacturing "zengpian". After repeated research and humbly exchanging opinions with everyone, he finally created the "zengpian chopping machine." The "zengpian" made by the zengpian chopping machine was neat and smooth, completely in accordance with the specifications, improved production efficiency four times, ensured the supply of doors and windows, and the workers no longer worried about cutting their hands.
      Last winter, the largest metal structure factory in the Northwest was to carry out winter construction. Zhu Genfu and his team were transferred to the metal structure factory construction site to take on the task of making templates for vertical columns and beams. The working environment at the metal structure factory construction site during winter construction was relatively harsh. The workers lived in sheds made of grass. Xi'an had been snowing heavily for many days, and the weather was very cold, and their hands and feet were frozen and numb. Zhu Genfu knew that this factory had the huge task of producing prefabricated steel beams for factory buildings in the entire Xi'an area, and it had to be completed ahead of schedule, and could not be delayed. He forgot the cold and worked enthusiastically, often overfulfilling the production tasks. When this project was completed, he was awarded the title of third-class meritorious worker.
    At the beginning of this year, even larger-scale construction began. Zhu Genfu was transferred to a new construction site to accept the task of manufacturing machines for coal cinder hollow bricks. Zhu Genfu had lived near this construction site last year. At that time, it was still a field, but now it has become a new industrial zone. This made Zhu Genfu feel unspeakably happy.
    Manufacturing coal cinder hollow bricks was a first in Xi'an. Zhu Genfu had never seen the appearance of coal cinder hollow bricks before. The difficulty of manufacturing machines for manufacturing coal cinder hollow bricks can be imagined. Zhu Genfu did not bow his head in the face of difficulties. He was thinking and researching day and night. More than a week passed, and his eyes were red. Others advised him to rest, but he always refused. Especially when he saw that many houses had already started to be built and urgently needed coal cinder hollow bricks, he could not sleep even more. A sense of responsibility urged him, making him forget his fatigue. Finally, he researched a method of making coal cinder hollow brick shell devices with waste wood, which increased the efficiency of manufacturing coal cinder hollow bricks by four times, ensured the progress of the project, and saved a lot of templates for the country.
    The construction of Xi'an inspired Zhu Genfu, and Zhu Genfu also developed a deep affection for Xi'an in his work. In terms of living habits, thanks to proper care, it was not as hard as he had thought and heard before he came, and he did not get sick due to acclimatization, and he was even fatter than when he was in Shanghai. Especially last September, he attended the Second Northwest Regional Conference on Exchange and Promotion of Advanced Experience in Construction Engineering and learned that the Northwest region has rich mineral resources such as oil, coal, iron, and copper, waiting for more people to develop and build; many barren areas will become beautiful and important industrial cities in the future... He was even happier.
    Recently, Zhu Genfu's eldest daughter sent him a letter, saying: "Dad! In half a month, I will graduate from elementary school. Mom asked me to ask you whether to go to school in Shanghai, find a job, or come to Xi'an?" Zhu Genfu thought that Xi'an is building so many factories and schools, and it needs manpower support so much! It is necessary to come here to participate in construction or study. So Zhu Genfu plans to move his family here and live in Xi'an for a long time, so that the whole family can participate in the construction of Xi'an and the Northwest!

　　一个由上海来参加内地建设的人
　　吴嗣澄　扈世鑫
    陕西省西安市规模巨大的工业建设，吸引着越来越多的建设者。无论是在紧张施工的工地上，新建的工厂里，到处都有来自各地的工人。这些工人刚来的时候，对西安很生疏，有很多人还不愿意长期留住。而现在，他们却深深地爱上了这个城市。西北工程管理总局第三工程公司的建筑工人、劳动模范朱根富，就是其中的一个。
    朱根富从前在华东第三工程公司工作。去年五月初，公司动员工人到内地参加工业建设。当时，有人说西北生活苦，光吃包子（华东人把西安人吃的馍叫包子），没有大米吃；有的说西北太冷，鼻子都会冻坏的；有的说怕不服水土，还要带点家乡的烂泥，一有病喝点家乡的烂泥汤就好啦！朱根富听到这些话时，心里也有些七上八下的。但是，当他想到两个多月前在中央建筑工程部工程部队首届功臣模范代表会议上，部首长给他们的指示和鼓励时，思想开朗了。他想：“重点建设，是国家的命根子呀！自己是个劳动模范，为了建设国家，即使苦一些也不能躲在后边！”他于是向组织上申请：“坚决服从组织分配，到祖国最需要的地方去。”
    朱根富被分配到西安以后，很快就被新的建设景象吸引住了。他看到这里已经新建了许多工厂，有新式的发电厂和棉纺织厂，有许多很好的医院，也有许多学校。凭他那作过二十多年工人的眼睛，
  一看那宽阔的水泥马路，就知道：“这是新建才不过两年的路啊！”他又听到西安的同志说：“胡宗南匪帮在西安破坏和剥削得非常残酷，如果有建设，只不过是修了很多杀人的战壕和碉堡！”朱根富耳闻目睹到这些情景，激动得自言自语地说：“来晚了！来晚了！要赶上去。”
    怎样赶上去呢？朱根富心想：“要搞先进工具，加快建设进度！”组织上接受了他的要求，把他分配到了木材加工厂先进工具研究小组工作。
    刚一开始工作，正赶上工地需要大量的门窗，可是工人在做门窗用的“橧片”时完全凭手用斧子砍，不但达不到定额，一不小心还容易把手砍破。朱根富看到这种情况，十分着急，日夜琢磨要创造一个制造“橧片”的先进工具。经过他反复钻研，虚心同大家交换意见，终于把“斩橧机”创造成功了。用斩橧机制出的“橧片”又整齐又光滑，完全合乎规格，提高了生产效率四倍，保证了门窗的供应，工人们再也不担心怕砍破手了。
      去年冬天西北最大的金属结构厂要进行冬季施工。朱根富和他们的小组又被调到金属结构厂工地担任制立柱、过梁的模板的任务。冬季施工的金属结构厂工地上的工作环境比较艰苦。工人住的是用草搭的工棚，西安接连不断地下了许多天大雪，天气很冷，冻得手脚都不灵便。朱根富知道这个工厂负担生产全西安地区厂房预制钢梁的巨大任务，只能提前修好，不能拖后。他忘了寒冷，热情地工作，经常超额完成生产任务。当这项工程完工时，他荣获了三等功臣的称号。
    今年一开春，规模更大的建设展开了。朱根富又被调到一个新的工地工作，接受制造煤屑空心砖机器的任务。朱根富去年曾经在这个工地附近住过，那时，这里还是一片田野，如今这里成了新的工业区。这使朱根富心里有说不出的愉快。
    制造煤屑空心砖，在西安还是第一次。朱根富过去也没见过煤屑空心砖的样子，要制造出制造煤屑空心砖的机器，那种困难是可以想像的。朱根富没有在困难面前低头，他白天黑夜都在思索，研究，一个多星期过去了，他的眼睛都熬红了；别人劝他休息一下，他总是不肯。特别是当他看到很多房子已经开始砌墙，急需煤屑空心砖的时候，他越发睡不着觉了。一种责任心督促他，使他忘记了疲劳，终于研究出用废木料制煤屑空心砖壳子器的办法，使制造煤屑空心砖的效率提高了四倍，保证了工程进度，给国家节约了大量的模板。
    西安的建设鼓舞着朱根富，朱根富在劳动中也对西安发生了深厚的感情，在生活习惯方面，由于得到了适当的照顾，并不像他来之前想到的和听到的那样苦，也并没有因水土不服闹过什么病，而且比在上海时更胖了。特别是去年九月，他出席了西北区第二届建筑工程先进经验交流推广大会，了解到西北地区有石油、煤、铁、铜等丰富的矿藏，等待更多的人来开发、建设；许多荒野的地带，将来将变成美丽的重要的工业城市……他更加高兴了。
    最近，朱根富的大女儿给他来了一封信，信上说：“爸爸！再过半个月，我就要高小毕业了，妈妈叫我问你，是在上海升学还是找工作，还是到西安来？”朱根富想，西安建设这么多的工厂和学校，多么需要人力支援啊！到这里来参加建设或学习都是必要的。朱根富于是打算把家搬来，在西安长久住下去，使全家都参加西安和西北的建设！
