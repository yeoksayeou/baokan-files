Editorial: Guarantee of Building a Strong National Defense

     The Second Session of the First National People's Congress passed the "Military Service Law of thePeople's Republic of China." This military service law concentrates and embodies the firm will of the Chinese people to defend their great motherland, and ensures that our country can build a strong national defense force. According to the provisions of the military service law, our country's military system will undergo a thorough reform. This means changing from the past voluntary military service system to a compulsory military service system: all male citizens who have reached the age of eighteen, regardless of nationality, race, occupation, social origin, religious belief, or education level, will legally fulfill the glorious obligation of serving in the military and defending the motherland as stipulated by our country's constitution.

     The Chinese People's Liberation Army has always implemented a voluntary military service system during the long revolutionary war period in the past. This means that a group of people who were determined to dedicate themselves to the cause of the Chinese people's revolution voluntarily joined the People's Army led by the Chinese Communist Party, serving for a long time, without a fixed term, and without rotation. They only had one goal: to spare no sacrifice in order to win the victory of the revolutionary war. The Chinese Communist Party-led Chinese people's revolution relied on this heroic army, together with the broad masses of the people, to overthrow the bloody rule of imperialism and domestic counter-revolutionary forces through a long period of revolutionary war, and established the great People's Republic of China.

     Now, except for Taiwan, the entire mainland of our country has been completely liberated, and the unified people's democratic dictatorship has been established and consolidated. Since 1953, our country's first five-year plan for developing the national economy has begun to be implemented, and our people are working hard and peacefully to build a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist industrial country. The mission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is, as stipulated in the Constitution, "to defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, and to defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security of the country." Domestically, it must strive to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, actively prepare to liberate Taiwan, the territory of the motherland, and complete the great cause of liberating all of China. Externally, it must at any time defend against imperialist aggression, protect our country's socialist construction, and defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland. In order to accomplish this sacred mission entrusted by the great motherland, the Chinese People's Liberation Army must not only have a strong modernized army, but also a strong modernized air force and navy. This requires the People's Liberation Army not only to have a considerable number of active-duty troops, but also to accumulate a solid reserve of well-trained personnel. This is a major event that concerns the fundamental interests of our people and the security of the country. If the voluntary military service system continues to be implemented at this time, it will not be able to meet this new need, because it does not have a system of regular conscription and retirement, and it cannot accumulate a strong reserve of well-trained personnel. Therefore, a new military service system must now be implemented, namely the compulsory military service system.

     After the implementation of the compulsory military service system, our country will have a group of eligible conscripted youths enlist every year, and a group of soldiers who have completed their active service will retire and be incorporated into the first category of reserves; and a large number of citizens who are of eligible age but have not been conscripted into active service will be incorporated into the second category of reserves. At the same time, a group of officers who have completed their active service will be transferred to the reserve, and reserve officers will be trained from universities, state agencies, and enterprises. With a large number of well-trained reserve personnel and sufficient reserve officers, the state can maintain the military strength necessary for national defense during peacetime, save manpower, materials, and financial resources, and concentrate on socialist construction, laying a solid economic foundation for national industrialization and national defense modernization. If imperialism launches a war of aggression against our country, our country can quickly organize a strong armed force on the basis of a solid reserve force to effectively counterattack the enemy and protect the security of the country. It can be seen that the implementation of the compulsory military service system is the most appropriate, as it is conducive to the construction of the motherland and facilitates the defense against foreign aggression at any time.

     Our country's implementation of the compulsory military service system is entirely for the purpose of consolidating our national defense, preventing imperialist aggression, and completing the liberation of all of our motherland's territory. We do not want to invade others; what we want is peaceful construction, using our peaceful labor to build socialism. Our country's large-scale first five-year plan vividly illustrates our determination to carry out long-term peaceful construction. Contrary to the situation in some imperialist countries, which use more than 70 percent of their budgets to expand armaments and atomic weapons and endlessly expand their armed forces, our country has demobilized more than 4.51 million people from the armed forces in the past few years. This fully demonstrates that our country is gradually taking measures to adapt to the needs of our country's peaceful construction.

     In his speech "The Current International Situation and China's Foreign Policy" at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, Premier Zhou Enlai clearly announced that the Chinese government and the Chinese people firmly pursue the policy of striving for world peace and human progress in international affairs. Premier Zhou Enlai also pointed out that the summit meeting of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France has brought about a certain degree of relaxation in the international situation, but the issue of universal disarmament has not yet been specifically resolved, the threat of war has not yet been eliminated, and the encirclement organized by military bases and military blocs around our country has not yet been removed. Therefore, we must continue to strengthen the necessary national defense forces to cope with possible sudden attacks on our country by others. We want peace, but at the same time, we must protect our national independence and the integrity of our sovereignty, and protect the achievements of the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. This is the reason why the people of our country are enthusiastically demanding the implementation of the compulsory military service system and constantly strengthening their national defense.

     During the discussion of the draft constitution in 1954, the broad masses of the people expressed enthusiastic support for the glorious obligation of serving in the military and defending the motherland. After the promulgation of the Constitution, the people, especially the young people, wrote letters to state organs and newspapers and magazines, requesting that the military service law be formulated and implemented as soon as possible in accordance with the compulsory military service system. After our government decided in November 1954 to conduct a pilot program for conscription and replenishment of troops in 25 provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in accordance with the principles of the compulsory military service system, and at the same time carried out publicity for the compulsory military service system, the broad masses of young people and the people showed even greater enthusiasm and excitement. They believe that this system is completely suitable for both the country and the youth. Many people praised this system as having "four no delays," that is, no delay in national defense, no delay in production, no delay in marriage, and no delay in career. Others praised it by saying: "After serving as a soldier for a few years, one will be both literate and martial." Many old people who did not understand the compulsory military service system at first later also believed that the compulsory military service system was "reasonable and justifiable" and "both loyal and filial." During the pilot conscription and replenishment of troops, many women and parents encouraged their relatives to sign up for conscription. Many old people boasted everywhere because their sons were approved to serve in the military. Many young people who were approved to serve in the military were even more excited. There were many moving stories everywhere of parents sending their sons, wives sending their husbands, and brothers competing to sign up for conscription. The number of people who signed up for conscription nationwide exceeded the number stipulated by the state by more than ten times. The young people who were conscripted into the army actively worked hard to learn skills and made rapid progress. After the draft amendment to the military service law was discussed among the people nationwide in February this year, party and government organs, youth league and trade union organizations, and newspapers and magazines in various provinces and cities received many letters from young people every day requesting to serve in the military. The Ministry of National Defense alone received more than 15,000 letters from young people in various places requesting to serve in the military from February to May. This high patriotic enthusiasm of the people has given extremely strong support to the promotion of the compulsory military service system.

     Now this military service law has been passed by the Second Session of the First National People's Congress and promulgated for implementation by order of Chairman Mao Zedong. The implementation of our country's military service law will undoubtedly greatly strengthen our national defense forces. Precisely because of this, hidden counter-revolutionary elements must intensify their rumors and instigations. During the pilot conscription and replenishment of troops, counter-revolutionary elements fabricated many absurd and unfounded rumors to confuse people's minds. In the future, they will still fabricate various absurd rumors to carry out sabotage. Therefore, party and government organs and military service organs at all levels must pay attention to mobilizing and using various propaganda forces, combining them with regular work, especially the work of resettling demobilized soldiers, to conduct detailed propaganda and explanations to all state organ staff and the people, so that all citizens fully understand the content of the military service law, understand the superiority of the compulsory military service system, and promptly refute the rumors of counter-revolutionary elements with concrete facts, and expose and combat their various sabotage activities. Military service organs at all levels should better summarize and exchange experiences in the work of conscription and replenishment of troops, continuously improve the publicity work on the military service law, and improve the specific organizational work for promoting the compulsory military service system, so that this military service law can play a great role in our sacred cause of defending the motherland and building a socialist society.

    建设强大的国防力量的保证社论
    第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议通过了“中华人民共和国兵役法”。这个兵役法集中地体现了我国人民保卫自己伟大祖国的坚强意志，保证我国能够建设起强大的国防力量。依照兵役法的规定，我们国家的军事制度将实行彻底的改革，这就是从过去的志愿兵制改变为义务兵役制：一切年满十八岁的男性公民，不分民族、种族、职业、社会出身、宗教信仰和教育程度，都将依法履行我国宪法所规定的服兵役、保卫祖国的光荣义务。
    中国人民解放军在过去长期的革命战争时期，一直是实行志愿兵制的。这就是由决心为中国人民革命事业而献身的一部分人民志愿参加中国共产党所领导的人民军队，长期服务，没有期限，也没有轮换，他们只有一个目标，就是不惜一切牺牲来争取革命战争的胜利。中国共产党所领导的中国人民革命就是依靠这支英雄的军队，同广大人民在一起，经过长期的革命战争，才推翻了帝国主义和国内反革命势力的血腥统治，建立了伟大的中华人民共和国。
    现在，我们国家除台湾以外，全部大陆已经完全解放，统一的人民民主专政的政权已经建立并且巩固起来。从一九五三年起，我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划已经开始实施，我国人民正在为把落后的农业国建设成先进的社会主义工业国而进行着奋勇的和平劳动。中国人民解放军的任务，就是宪法中所规定的“保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家的主权、领土完整和安全”。对内，它要努力巩固人民民主专政，积极准备解放祖国领土台湾，完成解放全中国的大业；对外，它要随时防御帝国主义的侵略，保卫我国社会主义建设事业，保卫祖国的主权和领土完整。为了要完成伟大祖国所赋予的这种神圣任务，中国人民解放军不但要有强大的现代化陆军，而且还要有强大的现代化空军和海军。这就要求人民解放军不只要有相当数量的现役部队，而且还要积蓄雄厚的训练有素的预备兵员。这是关系我国人民根本利益和国家安全的大事。这时候如果继续实行志愿兵制，就不能适应这种新的需要了，因为它没有定期征集和退伍的制度，也就不能积蓄训练有素的强大的后备兵员。因此，现在必须实行一种新的兵役制度，即义务兵役制。
    实行义务兵役制以后，我国将每年都有一批适龄的应征青年入伍，也有一批服现役期满的士兵退伍，编入第一类预备役；并且有大量适龄而未征集服现役的公民编入第二类预备役。同时，每年都将有一批服现役期满的军官转入预备役，又有从高等学校、国家机关和企业中培养起来的预备役军官。国家有了大量的训练有素的预备兵员和足够的预备役军官，在平时只要保持国防上必需的兵额，可以节省出人力、物力和财力，集中使用于社会主义的建设，为国家工业化和国防现代化打下强固的经济基础。如果帝国主义一旦向我国发动侵略战争，我们的国家又可以在雄厚的后备力量的基础上迅速组织起强大的武装部队，有力地反击敌人，保卫国家的安全。由此可见，实行义务兵役制乃是最妥善的，它既有利于祖国的建设，又便于随时防御外来的侵略。
    我国实行义务兵役制完全是为了巩固自己的国防，防止帝国主义的侵略，同时完成自己祖国领土的全部解放。我们不要侵略别人，我们要的是和平建设，用自己的和平劳动来建设社会主义。我国规模宏大的第一个五年计划，生动地说明了我们进行长期的和平建设的决心。和某些帝国主义国家用百分之七十以上的预算来扩充军备和原子武器、无限制地扩大武装部队的情形相反，我国几年来已经从部队中复员了四百五十一万多人。这就充分说明了我们的国家正在逐步地采取措施，以适应我国和平建设的需要。
    周恩来总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上所作的“目前国际形势和我国外交政策”的发言中明确地宣布，中国政府和中国人民在国际事务中坚决执行为世界和平和人类进步而努力的方针。周恩来总理并指出，苏、美、英、法四国政府首脑会议已使得国际形势有了一定程度的缓和，但目前普遍裁减军备的问题还没有得到具体解决，战争威胁还没有消除，在我国周围用军事基地和军事集团组织起来的包围圈还没有撤除，因此我们还必须继续增强必要的国防力量，以应付别人对我国可能发动的突然袭击。我们是要和平的，但同时必须保卫我们民族的独立和主权的完整，保卫我国人民革命胜利的成果。我国人民所以热烈要求实行义务兵役制，不断加强自己的国防，原因也就在这里。
    在一九五四年讨论宪法草案的期间，广大人民就对于服兵役、保卫祖国的光荣义务表示热烈拥护。宪法颁布以后，人民群众尤其是广大青年，都纷纷向国家机关和报刊杂志写信，要求按照义务兵役制，早日制定并实行兵役法。一九五四年十一月我国政府决定按照义务兵役制的原则在全国二十五个省和内蒙古自治区试行征集补充兵员，同时进行义务兵役制的宣传以后，广大青年和人民群众更表现出高度的热情和兴奋。他们认为这一制度对于国家和青年都是完全适宜的。许多人称赞这种制度有
  “四不误”，即不误国防，不误生产，不误婚姻，不误职业。还有人称赞说：“当上几年兵，武通文也通。”有不少原先不了解义务兵役制的老年人，后来也认为义务兵役制是“合情合理”，“忠孝双全”。在试行征集补充兵员期间，许多妇女和家长鼓励自己的亲人报名应征。许多老年人因儿子被批准服兵役而到处夸耀。许多被批准服兵役的青年更是兴奋的了不得。各地都有很多父母送子，妻子送丈夫，兄弟争相应征等动人事例。全国报名应征的人数超过国家规定征集人数的十多倍。征集入伍的青年到达部队以后，都积极努力学本领，进步很快。今年二月兵役法修正草案在全国人民中进行讨论以后，各省、市的党政机关、青年团和工会组织以及报刊杂志，每天又都收到许多青年要求服兵役的来信。仅国防部在二月到五月间收到各地青年要求服兵役的信就有一万五千多封。人民群众的这种高涨的爱国热情，对于推行义务兵役制给予了极有力的支持。
    现在这个兵役法已由第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议通过，并经毛泽东主席命令公布实施。我国兵役法的实施无疑地将大大加强我们的国防力量。正因为这样，暗藏的反革命分子就一定要加紧进行造谣挑拨。在试行征集补充兵员期间，反革命分子就曾经制造过许多荒诞无稽的谣言来惑乱人心。今后他们仍然会制造出各种荒诞的谣言来进行破坏。因此，各级党政机关和兵役机关都必须注意动员和利用各种宣传力量，结合经常工作，尤其是安置复员军人的工作，向所有的国家机关工作人员和人民群众进行详细的宣传和讲解，使所有的公民都完全了解兵役法的内容，了解义务兵役制的优越性，及时地用具体事实驳斥反革命分子的谣言，揭露和打击他们的各种破坏活动。各级兵役机关更应该很好地总结和交流征集补充兵员工作的经验，不断地改进关于兵役法的宣传工作，改进推行义务兵役制的具体组织工作，使这个兵役法能够在我们保卫祖国和建设社会主义社会的神圣事业中发挥伟大的作用。
