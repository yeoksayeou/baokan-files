Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, August 8th: According to TASS, the International Conference on the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy will open on the 8th. The Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, Canada, and other countries participating in the conference held exhibitions separately in the League of Nations Building in Geneva on the 7th, illustrating the achievements of each country in the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    The Soviet exhibition aroused great interest among the audience and journalists. The exhibition was divided into several parts, introducing the use of atomic energy in various aspects of the national economy and science. On display were models, diagrams, photographs, industrial equipment, medical equipment, and other exhibits.

    The model of the reactor of the world's first atomic energy industrial power station attracted everyone's attention. The audience was very interested in carefully viewing the materials about the significant effects of using radioactive isotopes to treat certain diseases.

    The diagrams in the exhibition illustrated how atomic energy is applied to instruments that inspect the wear and tear of machine and cutting tool parts, as well as how it is applied in smelting work and physiological research. The exhibition also screened the documentary "The World's First," which introduced the situation of the Soviet atomic energy industrial power station.

    A sentence spoken by the Russian scientist Vernadsky as early as 1922 was translated into several languages and displayed at the exhibition. This sentence said: "The time is not far off when mankind will be able to master atomic energy—the source of power that makes it possible to build their lives according to their own will. Will people be able to use this power to benefit mankind, and not to kill each other? Scientists should not be indifferent to the possible consequences of their scientific work and scientific progress."

    苏联等国分别举办和平利用原子能展览会
    新华社八日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：和平利用原子能国际会议将在八日开幕，参加会议的苏联、美国、英国、法国、加拿大和其他国家等七日在日内瓦国联大厦分别举办了展览会，说明了各国在和平利用原子能方面获得的成就。
    苏联的展览会引起了观众和新闻记者的极大兴趣。展览会分成几个部分，介绍在国民经济和科学各方面使用原子能的情况。在展览会上展出的，有模型、图解、照片、工业装备、医疗器材及其他展览品。
    世界上第一个原子能工业电力站反应堆的模型吸引着大家的注意。观众很感兴趣地细细观看关于利用放射性同位素治疗某些疾病获得显著效果的材料。
    展览会上的图解说明：原子能如何应用于检查机器和切削工具部件磨损情况的仪器中，如何应用在冶炼工作和生理研究等方面。展览会上还放映了介绍苏联原子能工业电力站情况的纪录片“世界上第一个”。
    俄国科学家维尔纳德斯基早在一九二二年讲过的一句话被译成几国文字在展览会上展出，这句话说：“人类能够把原子能——这种使人有可能随自己的意志建设自己的生活的力量泉源——掌握在自己手里的时候已经不远了。人是否能利用这种力量来造福人类，而不用来自相残杀呢？科学家对于他们的科学工作和科学进步的可能后果不应当不闻不问。”
