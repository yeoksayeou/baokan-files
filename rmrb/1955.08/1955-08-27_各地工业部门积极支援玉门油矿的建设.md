Industrial Departments Across the Country Actively Support the Construction of Yumen Oilfield

Industrial departments across the country are actively supporting the construction of the Yumen Oilfield.

Since the beginning of this year, industrial departments and farmers across the country have sent more materials to the Yumen Oilfield. These include various new products from Anshan Iron and Steel, cranes from Dalian Hoisting Machinery Factory, machine parts manufactured by many factories in Shanghai, electric wires from Kunming Wire Factory, steel from Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, and winches from Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory. The supply of machine parts and equipment needed for production and construction from January to July this year was more than 23% higher than that of the entire year of last year.

More than 140 factories across the country are manufacturing machine parts for the Yumen Oilfield. Many factories are doing everything possible to meet the needs of the oilfield.

In the past, a large part of the machinery and equipment needed by the petroleum industry relied on imports from abroad. Now, domestically manufactured ten-ton crawler cranes, important equipment for oil refineries such as hot oil pumps, operating machines for oil extraction, alloy furnace tubes with special specifications and strict technical requirements, U-bends, and some instruments needed for oil extraction and refining, have been used in the production of the Yumen Oilfield. During the trial production of these materials, factory workers across the country overcame many difficulties. For example, the dewaxing machine undertaken by four factories in Shanghai and Wuxi was successfully trial-produced only after more than ten attempts.

Industrial departments across the country pay special attention to the quality of the equipment supporting the Yumen Oilfield. Many factories write to the oilfield to inquire about the use of their products. When the state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Rubber Factory learned from the reply from the drilling department that the mud pumps they made were of poor quality, they immediately tried to improve them and sent the improved samples to inquire whether they were qualified.

　　各地工业部门积极支援玉门油矿的建设
    全国各地工业部门积极支援玉门油矿的建设。
    今年以来，各地工业部门和农民把更多的物资送到玉门油矿。其中有鞍钢的各种新产品，有大连起重机器厂的吊车，上海许多工厂制造的机器配件，昆明电线厂的电线，重庆钢铁公司的钢材，还有贵阳矿山机器厂的卷扬机等。仅生产建设需用的机件器材，今年一到七月份供给的就比去年全年的还多百分之二十三以上。
    全国各地为玉门油矿制造机器配件的工厂就有一百四十多个。很多工厂都尽一切力量来满足油矿的需要。
    石油工业需要的机件、器材，过去有很大一部分依靠国外进口。现在，国内制造的十吨履带式大吊车，炼油厂的重要设备热油泵，采油用的作业机，规格特殊、技术要求严格的合金炉管、工字弯头等以及采油、炼油需用的一些仪器，已经在玉门油矿的生产中使用了。在试制这些器材时，各地工厂职工克服了不少困难。如上海和无锡的四家工厂承做的清腊机，先后试制十多次才获得成功。
    各地工业部门支援玉门油矿的器材特别注意质量。很多工厂给油矿写信，询问他们的产品使用情况。国营天津第一橡胶厂从钻井处的回信中知道他们做的泥浆泵等质量不好时，马上设法改进，并把改进后的样品寄去询问是否合格。
