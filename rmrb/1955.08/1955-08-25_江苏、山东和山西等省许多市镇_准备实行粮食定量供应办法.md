Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 24th: Six cities in Jiangsu Province, including Nanjing, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Nantong, and Xuzhou, have completed preparations for implementing the "Provisional Measures for Grain Rationing in Towns and Cities." Currently, population classification tables for each city have been completed. Residents are in the process of applying for grain purchase certificates. By the end of August, all grain purchase certificates will be distributed to residents.

Each city has established a grain work office, operating under the leadership of the Municipal People's Committee. Each district has established a grain management office, and each street office has established a central supply station to strengthen the management of grain consignment shops. All the above institutions are equipped with full-time staff to ensure timely grain supply to the masses. Each city has also drawn and trained a large number of staff to go deep into the street offices to assist in the work and carry out publicity and education. Prior to this, each city carried out pilot projects for grain rationing to gain experience for promotion throughout the city.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 24th: Ten cities in Shandong Province with a population of more than 50,000, including Jinan, Qingdao, Yantai, Weifang, Zibo, Dezhou, Tai'an, Linqing, Weihai, and Jining, will begin implementing the "Provisional Measures for Grain Rationing in Towns and Cities" from September. At present, the preparatory work in these cities has been basically completed.

In early July, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a special meeting to make specific arrangements for this work. In mid-July, ten cities successively established grain offices to investigate the existing population and formulate various tables, grain coupons, and grain certificates. Various localities also transferred a large number of government employees to study policies in order to carry out propaganda to the broad masses. Four thousand two hundred and forty-six government employees in eight cities including Qingdao, Jinan, Yantai, and Zibo have participated in this work.

From late July to early August, each city selected several districts, residents' committees, and residents' groups as pilot projects for the implementation of the "Provisional Measures for Grain Rationing in Towns and Cities." The staff in each pilot project generally spent three to five days training grassroots staff and widely publicized to the residents, helping residents to make grain consumption plans, etc. After patient education and meticulous work, residents expressed their support for this provisional measure, saying that the "Provisional Measures for Grain Rationing in Towns and Cities" is beneficial to both the country and themselves, and is a win-win situation.

When the above-mentioned ten cities were preparing to implement the "Provisional Measures for Grain Rationing in Towns and Cities," mass organizations such as trade unions and women's federations in various cities actively cooperated. Local public security departments have strengthened the investigation and crackdown on grain smuggling and the outflow of cooked food.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, August 24th: Ninety medium and small towns in Shanxi Province are actively preparing to implement the "Provisional Measures for Grain Rationing in Towns and Cities."

These towns have completed the work of verifying the population. More than 5,000 propaganda workers in Datong City, Yuci City, and various towns in Yuci Special District have reported the new supply measures to the masses more than twice. Now, more than 50 towns under the jurisdiction of Xin County, Yuci, and Changzhi Special Districts are beginning to issue supply certificates according to the verified population. In the process of preparation, Yuci City and Jinan Special District also conducted in-depth investigation and research, and generally understood the actual grain consumption of residents. Yanbei Special District also carried out a pilot project for grain rationing in towns and cities in Shuoxian County.

In the past four months, many towns in Shanxi Province have rectified the unified grain purchase and sales work in towns under the principle of ensuring supply and preventing waste. More than 6,000 collective food units in organs, groups, enterprises, factories, mines, and schools in various medium and small towns have implemented a strict pre-budgeting system for grain supply; residents have also generally formulated grain consumption plans under the principle of careful calculation. These works have laid a good foundation for the implementation of the "Provisional Measures for Grain Rationing in Towns and Cities."

The above-mentioned 90 towns will implement the "Provisional Measures for Grain Rationing in Towns and Cities" from September 1st. Taiyuan City has been trying it out since August 16th.
