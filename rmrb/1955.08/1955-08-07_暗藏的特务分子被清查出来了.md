    Hidden Special Agent Uncovered
    Meng Xiangguo, Vice President of Hunan Medical College

    Not long ago, a hidden counter-revolutionary element was uncovered at Hunan Medical College. His name was He Shoucheng, a special agent sent by the Chiang Kai-shek gang after being trained by their intelligence agency in Hong Kong. On the surface, he posed as a college student, but secretly he engaged in counter-revolutionary sabotage activities such as collecting intelligence.

    The special agent He Shoucheng is twenty-four years old this year, from Nanhai County, Guangdong Province. He was born in Hong Kong and completed middle school there. In the autumn of 1952, he returned to the mainland to participate in the unified entrance examination for higher education institutions and was assigned to the public health specialty class at Hunan Medical College. During the winter vacation that year, he went home, and because he did not want to continue studying in the specialty class, he stayed in Hong Kong. At this time, he often associated with some disreputable "friends." Because he was used to the decadent life of the bourgeoisie, he still felt dissatisfied at home and eventually moved in with a "friend." This "friend" treated him solicitously, giving him two yuan a day for "bread money." This "friend's" mother also showed special care for him and suggested that he find a job. He Shoucheng expressed his hope to continue studying. She immediately agreed to ask a "friend" for help to get him to study in Taiwan. Soon, she introduced He Shoucheng to a "new friend" who he got along with very well and was willing to sponsor his "studies," but told him: "You come from the mainland, so there is a lot of suspicion. I can't guarantee that you can study in Taiwan; I think it's better for you to go back to the mainland. I will be fully responsible for all expenses, but you must undergo some training before returning, and then do some intelligence gathering work." He Shoucheng knew that this was asking him to be a special agent. His cousin was a special agent, and he had interacted with him in the past, so he already knew this kind of thing. However, he envied the fact that being a special agent was a money-making profession, and the next day he readily agreed. In addition to giving him money, these people also warned him: "There is a most powerful means in the organization (special agent organization), that is, if it is discovered that you are not loyal to the 'cause' and have the intention of betraying, you will be exposed to the Communist Party." In this way, He Shoucheng decided to wholeheartedly devote himself to the counter-revolutionary "cause." After more than a month of special agent training, the special agent leader cleverly hid the medicinal powder for secret communication in his suitcase. In October 1954, he returned to Changsha with the re-enrollment permit sent by the school (he joined the special agent organization and later wrote a letter applying for re-enrollment). This Chiang Kai-shek "Second Department of National Defense stationed in Changsha intelligence agent" He Shoucheng was thus lurking in our school.

    After the special agent He Shoucheng sneaked in, he began to carry out counter-revolutionary activities using double-dealing tactics. He often said, "Because I love the motherland, I decided to return to school." Not long after returning to school, the comrades in the personnel department talked to him, and he felt that the school suspected him and that he had to hide himself better. At this time, he remembered the "instructions" of the special agent leader: to maintain an attitude "more ordinary than ordinary," so he tried to find some "masses" to cover himself. Usually, when he went out shopping or watching movies, he always invited some classmates to go with him. Some people who liked to eat, play, and were greedy for petty gains, and who had liberalistic tendencies, quickly became his "good friends" and unknowingly became the special agent's air-raid shelter. He Shoucheng enjoyed the state's grant-in-aid treatment like other students, but his life was different from others. He often had a lot of money to invite classmates to eat and drink outside. Why did he have so much money? And why was he so "generous"? These students never suspected it. The enemy is not without weaknesses, but our people are too politically numb, and some people are even blinded by one or two treats. After being arrested, the special agent He Shoucheng confessed: "Because I had little experience (in being a special agent), I was very afraid at first. Especially when reading the newspaper, I often came across news of special agents being arrested and suppressed, and I couldn't calm down and felt great fear and anxiety; fortunately, the classmates always looked around, and no one looked directly at me." But no one paid attention to him, and over time, the special agent He Shoucheng settled down and actively launched his special agent activities. From the time he was dispatched until his arrest, He Shoucheng sent out a total of eleven pieces of intelligence. He did not let go of any loopholes, and time and time again he used secret communication methods to send the collected intelligence to the Hong Kong intelligence agency. When he and his classmates went to visit a factory, he collected the product quantities on the factory's blackboard newspaper and wrote them into intelligence. He also often went to the mailbox at the entrance of the mailing room to steal letters sent from troops and factories and mines. These suspicious traces did not attract people's attention.

    Not only that, but people also gave him the time and conditions to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. He Shoucheng sometimes pretended to be sick, did not attend classes, did not participate in exercises, did not participate in reading newspapers, and did not go out with his classmates; or he used Saturday evenings and other entertainment activities to conduct secret communication with the Hong Kong intelligence agency. This special agent was obviously no longer "more ordinary than ordinary," but our people were still indifferent and gave him enough time and conditions to engage in special agent activities. Is this not worthy of our vigilance?

    More seriously, He Shoucheng told a "best friend" about his identity as a special agent without any concealment, and even asked him if he wanted to do it. The special agent was very confident that he and that classmate had a deep "friendship" and would not expose him. Sure enough, this "best friend," in order to be loyal to their "friendship," actually covered up He Shoucheng's special agent crime of betraying the interests of the country and the people. Such knowing but not reporting is far from being a problem of numbness, right-leaning, or liberalism; it has developed into a crime of harboring counter-revolutionaries. It is precisely because in our ranks, there are some people with liberalistic problems, people who covet petty favors, and even some criminal elements mixed in who collude with the enemy and act as accomplices, that the special agent He Shoucheng was able to settle down here, and he even made a "long-term" plan to return to Hong Kong again this summer vacation to receive special agent training in Taiwan in order to further endanger the motherland, endanger the people, and commit more and greater counter-revolutionary crimes. Who could have imagined that this "college student" being cultivated by the motherland was engaged in selling out the motherland, and even planned to go to Taiwan for "advanced studies"!

    However, no matter how cleverly the enemy hides, they will eventually escape the net laid by the people. Because we have a strong revolutionary force, and counter-revolutionary elements always have difficulties in carrying out activities. Since they want to be counter-revolutionary, it is impossible to completely conceal their true colors. The hidden counter-revolutionary element He Shoucheng was finally uncovered in this struggle to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements. This fact shows that as long as we are vigilant and take action, any enemy and any enemy conspiracy will be defeated.

    暗藏的特务分子被清查出来了
    湖南医学院副院长  孟献国
    不久以前，在湖南医学院清查出来一个暗藏的反革命分子，他名叫何守诚，是经蒋贼在香港的特务机关训练后被派遣进来的特务分子。他外表上装成一个大学生的样子，暗地里却进行着搜集情报等反革命破坏活动。
    特务分子何守诚今年二十四岁，广东省南海县人，生在香港，在香港念完了中学。一九五二年秋，他回到大陆参加高等学校统一招生考试后，被分配到湖南医学院公共卫生专科班学习。这年寒假他回家去，因不愿继续在专科班学习，便留在香港。这时候，他常同一些不三不四的“朋友”往来。由于他过惯了资产阶级的腐化堕落生活，在家里还感到不满足，后来就索性搬到一个“朋友”那里去住。这个“朋友”殷勤地款待他，每天给他两块钱的“面包费”。这个“朋友”的母亲对他也特别关怀，曾建议他找工作做。何守诚表示希望能继续念书。她立刻答应找“朋友”帮忙，让他到台湾去念书。不久，她给何守诚介绍了一个“新朋友”，一见面就很谈得来，很愿意资助他“念书”，但对他说：“你是从大陆来的，嫌疑很大，到台湾去念书我不敢担保；我看你还是回大陆的好，一切费用我完全负责，只是回去之前要受一种训练，以后做点搜集情报的工作。”何守诚知道这是叫他当特务，他表哥是当特务的，过去有过来往，他早就知道这一套，但是他羡慕当特务是个赚钱的职业，第二天便满口答应了。这些人除了给他钱以外，还警告他：“组织内（特务组织）有一种最厉害手段，就是假若发觉你不忠实于‘事业’，而有叛变的意思，就会把你暴露给共产党。”就这样，何守诚便决定死心塌地效忠于反革命“事业”了。经过一个多月的特务训练，特务头子替他把秘密通讯用的药粉巧妙地藏在皮箱里，一九五四年十月，他凭着学校寄去的复学通行证（他参加特务组织后来信申请复学）返回长沙。这个蒋贼“国防部第二厅驻长沙谍报员”何守诚就这样在我们学校里潜伏下来了。
    特务分子何守诚钻进来以后，就开始以两面派手法进行反革命活动。他口里常说：“因为我热爱祖国，所以才决定回来复学。”回到学校不久，人事科的同志找他谈话，他感到学校里在怀疑他，必须把自己更好地隐蔽起来。这时候，他记起了特务头子的“指示”：要保持“比平常人更平常”的态度，便想办法找一些“群众”来掩护自己，平常出外逛街看电影时，总是找一些同学一起去；有些好吃爱玩爱贪小便宜的人，存在着自由主义的人，很快地便成了他的“好朋友”，不知不觉地做了特务分子的防空洞。何守诚和其他的学生一样享受着国家助学金的待遇，可是生活过得与众不同，经常有很多钱邀同学们一起到外边去吃喝。他为什么这么有钱？又为什么如此“慷慨”？这些学生是从来没有怀疑过的。敌人并不是没有弱点的，只是我们的人政治上太麻痹了，有的人甚至被一两次请客油迷了心窍。特务分子何守诚被捕后供称：“我因为经验（干特务的经验）少，所以起初很害怕，尤其是读报的时候，常常碰到特务被捕获被镇压的消息，我就沉不住气，感到极大的恐惧和不安；幸亏同学们总是东张西望，没有一个人直望着我。”可是谁也没有注意他，久而久之，特务分子何守诚就安下心来，并积极展开了他的特务活动。从被派遣进来以后到被捕前止，何守诚一共发出了十一次情报。他不放松任何一个空子，一次又一次地用秘密通讯的方法把搜集到的情报寄给香港特务机关。当他和同学们一道去参观某工厂时，便把工厂黑板报上的产品数量等汇集起来，写成了情报。他还常到收发室门口的收信栏去偷看从部队和厂矿寄来的信件。这些可疑的形迹，也没有引起人们的注意。
    不仅这样，人们还给了他从事反革命活动的时间和条件。何守诚有时假称有病，不上课，不上操，不参加读报，也不和同学们去玩；或者利用星期六晚上和其他文娱活动的时间，在同香港特务机关进行秘密通讯。这个特务分子显然已不再是“比平常人更平常”的样子了，而我们的人却依然熟视无睹，而且给了他从事特务活动的足够的时间和条件，这难道不值得我们警惕吗？
    更严重的是，何守诚曾毫无隐讳地把自己的特务身份告诉一个“最要好的同学”，并且还问他干不干。这个特务分子很有把握地相信，他和那个同学有深厚的“友情”，不会把他暴露出来。果然，这个“最要好的同学”为了忠于他们的“友情”，竟把何守诚这种出卖国家和人民利益的特务罪行包庇下来了。这样知情不举已经远远不是什么麻痹右倾、自由主义的问题了，这已经发展成为包庇反革命的罪行了。正是因为在我们的队伍中，有一些有自由主义毛病的人，贪图小恩小惠的人，甚至还混杂了某些私通敌人、为虎作伥的犯罪分子，所以特务分子何守诚才能在我们这里安下身来，而且他还订下了一个“长远的”计划，准备今年暑假仍旧回香港，再到台湾去受特务训练，以便更进一步地危害祖国，危害人民，干出更多更大的反革命罪行来。谁能料想到：祖国正在培养着的这个“大学生”，却在从事出卖祖国的勾当，而且还打算到台湾去“深造”！
    然而，无论敌人隐蔽得如何巧妙，最后总逃不脱人民布下的天罗地网。因为我们有强大的革命力量，而反革命分子进行活动总是存在着困难的。他们既要反革命，就不可能将其本来面目隐蔽得十分彻底。暗藏的反革命分子何守诚终于在这次肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子的斗争中被清查出来。这件事实说明我们只要警惕起来，行动起来，任何敌人和敌人的任何阴谋都必将归于失败。
