In the period around the "August 1st" Army Day, Shanghai's districts organized inspection teams to conduct a general inspection of the work of factories and enterprises in resettling demobilized construction soldiers. The inspection results show that nearly 10,000 demobilized construction soldiers in the city have participated in work in various departments such as industry, transportation, and commerce. Many units have managed to assign them jobs according to their abilities and have paid attention to their training. For example, the state-owned Shanghai Broadcasting Equipment Factory absorbed more than a dozen demobilized construction soldiers to participate in production work, and at the same time, enrolled them in amateur radio study classes. Now they have all reached the level of third or fourth grade technicians. Among them, demobilized soldier Qiao Shizhong not only quickly became familiar with the business, but also actively put forward various rationalization proposals for saving national resources, and was rated as an advanced worker of the factory in 1954. The joint state-private Wuzhou Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory is planning to train three demobilized construction soldiers as production workers, biological experimenters, and drug analysts respectively. Demobilized soldier Zhao Dexin, who was originally a technician in this factory, worked very actively. After repeated experiments, he found a way to solve the difficulty of raw materials in the process of manufacturing dysentery drugs, which can save the country 60,000 yuan per year.

In this inspection, as well as in inspections since the first half of this year, it has also been found that some units do not care enough about the demobilized construction soldiers participating in production and work. Individual units refused to employ demobilized construction soldiers on the pretext, improperly resettled them, or delayed in converting the demobilized construction soldiers participating in production or work into permanent workers, and so on. After inspection and criticism, some of these phenomena have been changed, and some are being changed. (Xinhua News Agency)

    上海检查安置复员军人的工作
    “八一”建军节前后，上海市各区分别组织了检查组，对工厂企业安置复员建设军人的工作普遍进行了一次检查。检查结果表明，全市已有近一万名复员建设军人参加了工业、交通运输业、商业等各个部门工作。很多单位对他们的工作做到了量材使用，和注意对他们的培养。如国营上海广播器材厂吸收十几个复员建设军人参加生产工作，同时把他们编入业余的无线电学习班学习，现在他们已全部达到三级或四级技术工人的水平。其中复员军人乔世忠不仅很快熟悉了业务，而且积极提出了各种节约国家资财的合理化建议，被评为这个厂一九五四年先进工作者。公私合营五洲化学制药厂正有计划地把三个复员建设军人分别培养为生产工人、生物试验员和药品分析员。原在这个厂担任技术员的复员建设军人赵德馨工作很积极，他经过反复试验，在制造治痢疾的药品的过程中，设法解决了生产原料的困难，每年可为国家节约六万元。
    在这次以及今年上半年以来的检查中，也发现有些单位对参加生产和工作的复员建设军人不够关心，个别单位借故拒绝录用复员建设军人，对他们安置不妥，或迟迟不把参加生产或工作的复员建设军人转为长期工，等等。经过检查和批评，这些现象有的已经改变，有的正在改变。（新华社）
