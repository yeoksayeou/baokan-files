Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd Dispatch: According to a TASS report: The US agricultural delegation, headed by Lambert, has left Moscow for home on the 21st, after a visit of more than a month to the Soviet Union. Officials from the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and State Farms, and personnel from the US Embassy in the Soviet Union were at the airport to see them off.

On the eve of their departure, the delegation held a press conference in Moscow on the 20th. At the press conference, Lambert said that the delegation was not able to see everything it wanted to see in the Soviet Union, but what it had seen left a good impression on the state of Soviet agriculture. He said, "We were very impressed by the fertile land of Ukraine and Kuban, the agricultural production of Tashkent Oblast and Alma-Ata Oblast, and the reclamation of wasteland. There are still many difficulties in the wasteland, but we believe that you will soon overcome them. The US agricultural delegation received particularly cordial hospitality everywhere in the Soviet Union. The delegates are returning with a good impression of your country and people."

Delegation member Olson pointed out that their deepest impression was that they saw the Soviet people's desire for peace everywhere. Another member, Owen, believed that the Soviet people were completely satisfied with their current situation and looked forward to the future with confidence. The Soviet people have truly created miracles, and they have rebuilt all the cities that were destroyed during the war.

Lambert and Jacobs expressed the opinion of the entire delegation that they hoped to improve relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. They also said that the exchange of agricultural delegations had made a good start for the people of the two countries to achieve better mutual understanding.

　　美国农业代表团访问苏联后离莫斯科回国
　　代表团在行前记者招待会上表示希望改善苏美关系
    新华社二十二日讯　据塔斯社报道：以兰伯特为首的美国农业代表团在苏联进行了一个多月的访问后，已经在二十一日离莫斯科回国。到机场欢送的有苏联农业部和国营农场部的负责人和美国驻苏联大使馆人员。
    在离苏前夕，代表团于二十日在莫斯科举行了记者招待会。在招待会上，兰伯特说，代表团在苏联没有能看到它所想看到的一切，但是它所已看到的东西使人对苏联的农业状况有良好的印象。他说，我们印象很深的是乌克兰和库班的肥沃的土地、塔什干州和阿拉木图州的农业生产以及开垦荒地。在荒地上还存在有许多困难，但是我们认为，你们很快就会克服。美国农业代表团在苏联到处都受到特别殷勤的招待。代表们是带着对你们的国家和人民的良好印象回去的。
    代表团团员奥尔逊指出，他们印象最深的就是他们到处都看到苏联人要求和平的愿望。另一个团员欧恩认为，苏联人对自己现在的处境是完全满意的，他们满怀信心地瞻望着将来。苏联人真正创造了奇迹，他们重建了在战争时期被破坏的一切城市。
    兰伯特和雅各布斯表达全代表团的意见说，他们希望改善苏联同美国之间的关系。他们并且说，互派农业代表团为两国人民达到更好地互相谅解作出了良好的开端。
