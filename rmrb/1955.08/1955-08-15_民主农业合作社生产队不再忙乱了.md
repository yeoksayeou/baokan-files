The Democratic Agricultural Cooperative in Guankou Township, Xishui County, Hubei Province, implemented seasonal contract work in 1954. This year, they further implemented contract work with guaranteed output. After the implementation of contract work with guaranteed output, the mutual suspicion between production teams, fearing losses, completely disappeared. The sense of responsibility of the teams towards the cooperative was strengthened, and the production enthusiasm of the members was further enhanced. However, the chaotic phenomena within each production team still existed. The most prominent problem was the poor arrangement of tasks and labor. The most troubling thing for the production team leaders was assigning work every night. The team leader would assign tasks, and the members would wait for instructions, which would often take up most of the night. Sometimes, due to the inadequate arrangement of tasks and labor, many things were piled up and couldn't be done; at other times, there was nothing to do, and labor was wasted. Once, the entire third team, with more than ten male laborers, concentrated on weeding wheat seedlings, while the women were idle. They should have sent some of the female members to weed the wheat seedlings and some of the male members to top-dress, but due to inadequate planning in advance, the top-dressing work was not arranged. The next day, it rained heavily, and they had to wait for the weather to clear before top-dressing. After the rain, they had to weed again, and it was too late for top-dressing, which affected the normal growth of the wheat seedlings. The members didn't understand or were not familiar with the production arrangements of the entire team. Some people wanted to manage but couldn't, and could only "watch the team leader's chin move," unable to exert their initiative. In the past, when they worked individually, no one could avoid considering their own production; now, it was different. Member Guo Shaofu said, "I enjoy the leisure and freedom." At the same time, because the work was not arranged well, labor was wasted, and the personal activities that members could carry out (such as collecting firewood, making rice, etc.) also had no time to be carried out. Therefore, some members complained, "Joining the cooperative is too 'binding'."

The cooperative committee held a meeting to study these problems and believed that the reasons for these problems were mainly: after the implementation of contract work with guaranteed output, the cooperative relaxed its leadership over the production teams; the responsibility of the production team leaders increased, but they lacked leadership experience, could not plan production work, and were not good at mobilizing the members to jointly complete the guaranteed output tasks. Therefore, the team leader was struggling, the members were "idle," and production was not doing well. The cooperative committee summarized the method of unified arrangement of tasks throughout the cooperative during the busy farming season in 1954 and believed that this method could be implemented in the production teams. The method was: the members of each team would arrange the tasks of their team section by section, implement "labor self-reporting," and the members of the entire team would jointly discuss the work plan and labor allocation plan for each small section of agricultural work. Everyone agreed to do this and decided that the director would first help the third team to implement it on a trial basis.

One evening, the members of the third team held a meeting to set the small section plan.

First, it was necessary to determine how long the work would be arranged for. Everyone felt that: if it was too long, it would not be easy to arrange perfectly; if it was too short, it would be too troublesome to arrange often. This time, they decided to prepare for transplanting rice seedlings during the period from after Qingming to before the Beginning of Summer (about half a month). After joint discussion, it was considered that there were four things to do during this period: accumulating fertilizer, transporting manure, preparing fields, and cultivating seedlings. Through the joint arrangement of production, the members changed their indifferent attitude towards the cooperative's production and became proactive. After arranging the above four things, Guo Ziqiang busily said, "The water chestnut and taro fields also need to be prepared." Everyone was reminded by him and said, "That's right, how dangerous! We forgot two jobs. If we waited until the last minute to do them, it would be chaotic again." Team leader Guo Dingxun said happily, "In the past, when only a few of us arranged the work, we forgot this and missed that; now everyone arranges the work together, there are more people and more ideas, how good!" Some members also suggested, "The edges of the fields that were dug by two people the day before yesterday were not completely cleared of grass and should be re-dug." Everyone unanimously supported it, saying, "That's right, we can't deceive ourselves. If the cooperative's production is not good, it has something to do with every member." With such an arrangement, everyone knew what the entire team should do during this period, and every member could exert initiative.

Second, it was not enough to find out the work; it was also necessary to calculate how much labor was needed. Based on their past experience and the cooperative's contract work standards, they calculated them one by one, totaling 738 work points. It was not enough to calculate how much work needed to be done; it was also necessary to calculate how much work the members of the entire team could do. This depended on the members consciously self-reporting. This time, the result of the self-reporting was that the entire team, excluding those who were away or sick, reported a total of 1,285 work points. Compared with the number of work points needed for this half month, there were 547 work points more.

The members looked at each other. Someone asked, "What should we do if there are too many work points?" The team leader again asked for everyone's opinions: "Can we do some of the work for the second half of the month in advance? So that we won't be too busy with harvesting rapeseed, planting cotton, and transplanting rice seedlings all at once in the next stage." An elderly member considered it for a while and then said, "I think we can plant some cotton in the early wheat fields first. As the saying goes: 'Dig cotton early before the Beginning of Summer'." Some suggested planting peanuts and beans on the edges of the fields in advance. After calculating these tasks, 421 work points were needed, leaving just over 100 work points. Everyone believed that these 100 work points could be used as a reserve for rainy days and temporary tasks.

Sometimes, the work points reported were not enough for the work required. Then, it was necessary to find ways to tap the labor potential or reasonably postpone some of the work. It was difficult for the work points reported and the number of work points needed to match exactly, and there were always more or less contradictions. Solving this problem was one of the most important tasks of the production team leader; solving this problem could avoid the phenomenon of not completing tasks or wasting labor.

After the implementation of the "labor self-reporting system," the members became more concerned about production, and many people proactively considered the production of the entire team. It was late at night, and some members were still carrying torches to take care of the rice seedlings in the nursery to prevent turtles from damaging the seedlings. Everyone was afraid that their reported work points would not be completed and would affect the cooperative's production. The labor attendance rate increased, and labor efficiency also improved.

In this way, not only was the cooperative's production plan turned into the plan of every member, but the personal activities of the members were also reasonably taken care of. As long as the members completed the work they had reported, they could engage in their own production activities if they had extra time. After completing the work he had reported, Guo Ziqiang also reclaimed some new wasteland to grow his own vegetables. He said with satisfaction: "In the past, if I had extra time, I wouldn't dare to do personal things, for fear of being said to be selfish, and I couldn't tell right from wrong, and even pretended to be sick and rested. With this unified arrangement of work and labor, the production of the entire team is planned, and individuals also have a plan, which is truly beneficial to both the public and private sectors."

Team leader Guo Dingxun also felt that now it was not only the cooperative's leaders who were busy, but everyone was concerned about production, and it was easier to lead the team's production. At the same time, with a short arrangement for each stage, the realization of the annual plan was also guaranteed.

After doing this, it was no longer necessary to spend a lot of time every night arranging work and recording points. The phenomena of work backlog, labor waste, and missing agricultural work were greatly reduced, and the leadership of the production team was adapted to the requirements of contract work with guaranteed output. This cooperative already had one year of contract work experience, and it was not very difficult to implement this method. Now, the three production teams of this cooperative have generally implemented this method.

    民主农业合作社生产队不再忙乱了
    李大荒
    湖北省浠水县关口乡民主农业生产合作社，在一九五四年实行了季节包工的基础上，今年又实行了包工包产。包工包产以后，各个生产队之间互相怕吃亏的怀疑根本消除了，队对社的责任心加强了，社员的生产积极性也进一步提高了。但是，各个生产队内部的混乱现象却仍然存在。最突出的问题，是活路和劳动力没有安排好。各生产队队长感到顶苦恼的事就是每晚排工。队长在那里分派，社员听候调动，一弄就是大半夜。有时候，由于活路和劳力安排不周，许多事挤在一堆做不了；有时又闲着没事可做，使劳力白白浪费了。有一次，第三队全队十多个男劳动力集中锄麦苗，妇女闲着无事可做；本来应该让一部分女社员去锄麦苗，让一部分男社员去追肥，可是由于事先考虑不周，没有安排追肥的工作。第二天下起了大雨，只好等到天晴再追肥。雨后又要再锄一次，还迟过了追肥的季节，影响了麦苗的正常生长。社员对全队生产安排不了解不熟悉，有些人想管管不上，只好“看队长的下巴动”，主动性不能发挥。往年单干时，谁也不能不考虑自己的生产；现在，就不同了。社员郭少甫说：“乐得个清闲自在。”同时，由于活路没有安排好，浪费了劳力，社员可以进行的个人活动（如打柴、做米等）也没有时间进行了。因此，有的社员就埋怨：“入了社太‘捆’人。”
    社委会开会研究了这些问题，认为发生这些问题的原因，主要是：包工包产以后社里放松了对生产队的领导；生产队长的责任加重了，可是却缺乏领导经验，不会计划生产工作，不善于发动社员共同完成包产任务。因此，队长吃力，社员“清闲”，生产搞不好。社委会总结了一九五四年大农忙时全社统一安排活路的办法，认为这个办法可以在生产队里实行。办法是：各队社员逐段安排本队的活路，实行“劳动自报”，全队社员共同商议每一小段的农活计划和劳力支配计划。大家都同意这样做，并决定先由社长在第三队帮助试行。
    一天晚上，第三队的社员开会订小段计划。
    首先，要确定安排多长时间内的工作。大家觉得：太长了，不易安排完善；太短了，时常安排又太麻烦。他们这一次确定，从清明后到立夏前一段时间内，作好插秧准备工作。大家共同商议，认为在这一段（约半月）时间内，有四宗事要做：积肥，送粪，盘田，培育秧苗。通过共同安排生产，社员改变了对社里的生产漠不关心的态度，变得积极主动了。在安排了上面四宗事以后，郭自强忙说：“还有荸荠、芋头田也要盘。”大家被他提醒了，说：“对，好险！搞掉了两宗活路。要是临头去做，又要弄得忙乱了。”队长郭定勋高兴地说：“往回光我们少数几个人排工，忘这掉那；现在大家来排工，人多主意多，多好！”有的社员又提出：“前天有两个人挖的地边，草没去尽，应该补挖。”大家一致拥护，说：“对，不能自己哄自己，社里生产不好，同每个社员都有关系。”这样一安排，人人都知道这一段全队应该做些什么事，每个社员都能发挥主动性。
    其次，把活路找出来了还不行，还要计算需要多少工。他们根据以往的经验和社里的包工标准，一宗一宗地计算出来，共需工七百三十八分。光把需要做多少活计算出来了还不行，还要计算全队的社员可能做多少活。这就要靠社员自觉地自报了。这一次自报的结果，全队除出外、害病的以外，自报工分共一千二百八十五分。和这半个月需要的工数相比，多出来五百四十七分。
    社员互相观望。有人问：“多了工，怎么办呢？”队长又征求大家意见：“可不可以把下半个月的活路提前做一些？免得下一段割油菜、种棉花、插秧三头忙，都挤在一堆了，忙不过来。”一个老年社员考虑了一下，接着说：“我看，可以把早小麦地先种一部分棉花。俗话说：‘立夏前，早挖棉’。”有的提出提前种花生和地边的豆子。把这些活路一计算，需要四百二十一分，还多一百来分。大家认为，这一百来分可以作为防天雨和临时机动工用。
    也有时候，自报的工分不够需要的工数，那就要想法挖掘劳动潜力或者合理地往后挪一些活路。自报劳动工分和活路的需工数是很难恰好相合的，总难免有或多或少的矛盾。解决这个问题是生产队长最主要的任务之一；把这问题解决了，就能避免完不成任务或浪费劳动力的现象。
    推行“劳动自报制”以后，社员对生产更加关心了，很多人主动地考虑全队的生产。大半夜了，还有社员打着火把去秧田照看，防止乌龟损害秧苗。人人都恐怕自己报的劳动工分完不成会影响社的生产。劳动出勤率增加了，劳动效率也提高了。
    这样，不仅把社的生产计划变成了每个社员的计划，社员个人的一些活动也得到了合理的照顾。社员只要完成了自报的工作，有多余时间，就可以从事自己的生产活动。郭自强完成了自报的工作后，还新开了一些荒地自己种菜。他满意地说：“往先有多余时间，也不敢做私人生活，怕人说自私自利，弄得皂白不分，甚至装病休息。这样把活路、劳力统一安排好了，全队生产有计划，个人也有个算盘，真是公私两利。”
    队长郭定勋还感到：现在不光是社里的几个领导人在那里忙来忙去，而是人人都关心生产，队的生产好领导了。同时，每一段有个短安排，全年计划的实现也有了保证。
    这样做了以后，不需要每天晚上费很长时间排工记分了，活路积压、劳力浪费、丢掉农活等现象大大减少了，生产队的领导同包工包产的要求相适应了。这个社已经有一年包工的经验，实行这个办法并不很费劲。现在，这个社的三个生产队已经普遍实行了这个办法。
