Comrades, sisters!

Our delegation, entrusted by the mothers and women of all of China, attended the World Mothers' Conference held in Lausanne, Switzerland, from July 7th to 10th, and has returned home in batches in late July. Allow me to convey to you the main situation and achievements of the conference.

(I)

The holding of the World Mothers' Conference and its successful conclusion are major events in international life, a great gathering of mothers and women to defend peace and protect children, and an important milestone in the struggle of mothers and women for lasting world peace.

This conference was proposed by the Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation at its meeting in Berlin in November 1954. In February of this year, the Enlarged Council Meeting of the International Democratic Women's Federation in Geneva unanimously adopted the "Appeal to the Mothers of the World," strongly calling on mothers around the world to actively participate in the World Mothers' Conference to be held in July. After the meeting, an international preparatory committee headed by the distinguished peace fighter Eugénie Cotton was established to broadly unite well-known women's organizations and individuals from various countries to participate in the preparatory work.

The proposal to convene the World Mothers' Conference received warm support and full support from mothers and women all over the world. Preparatory work was widely carried out in most countries around the world. Some countries, such as France, Finland, and Brazil, established preparatory committees with broad representation to carry out the work of preparing for and celebrating the World Mothers' Conference among the vast number of mothers and women. Some countries, such as Poland, West Germany, Japan, Italy, Austria, and Costa Rica, convened national or regional mothers' conferences, uniting women and mothers of various political views, and fully expressing their firm will to oppose war and demand peace. Other countries, such as Korea, India, and Indonesia, held "Mother's Day" or "Mother's Month." Many countries, in conjunction with the "March 8th" International Women's Day, "June 1st" International Children's Day, and the movement to sign the World Peace Council's "Appeal to the People of the World" against atomic warfare, widely carried out the propaganda and preparatory work for the World Mothers' Conference among the masses. This sparked a worldwide upsurge of mothers and women protecting children and defending peace across all continents.

The representatives attending this conference were very broad, totaling 1,060 people from 66 countries, including 964 official representatives, 23 observers, and 73 guests. This also included representatives and observers from 13 international organizations. This was a great meeting inspired by maternal love. Among the representatives, there were 825 mothers, some with 11 or 13 children, and one mother with 15 children. There were young mothers in their twenties, as well as old mothers, grandmothers, and even great-grandmothers over sixty years old. Many mothers have suffered severely from the disasters of war, some are mothers who have experienced the disasters of World War II, some are mothers who have fresh memories of the horrors of war, some are mothers from colonial and semi-colonial countries who have suffered exploitation and suppression, and some are mothers who have suffered hardships in their lives because the government's arms expansion and war preparations have swallowed up huge amounts of funds. They come from countries with different systems, belong to different races, have different skin colors, have different political views and religious beliefs, have different occupations and social status, and represent different organizations. Among them, 653 representatives are participating in international conferences for the first time, and 372 housewives who rarely participate in social and political activities.

The breadth of this conference is also reflected in the enthusiastic support it received from well-known figures and the vast number of mothers and women around the world. Women's organizations and well-known women from 79 countries wrote articles supporting the conference or sending congratulations to the conference, and the conference received more than 2,000 congratulatory telegrams and messages from various countries. Queen Elizabeth of Belgium wrote a moving congratulatory message to the conference: "I welcome the proposal to convene the World Mothers' Conference with great excitement. In warmly agreeing with this idea, I hope that the power of maternal love around the world will overcome evil, hatred, and its most despicable aspect—war, the atomic war that means human destruction." The conference also received congratulatory messages from some famous scholars, including Madame Joliot-Curie, a Nobel Prize winner from France, and Madame Lepeshinskaya, an academician of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences. It also received support articles and congratulatory telegrams from Song Qingling, winner of the Stalin International Peace Prize, an outstanding peace fighter, and Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, the great German writer Anna Seghers, the Indian Minister of Health, Mrs. Kaur, Member of Parliament, Mrs. Uma Nehru, and the chairman of the American "Save Our Sons" Committee, Mrs. Florence Gookill. In addition, there were congratulatory messages from many other groups and individuals. Let us read a letter from a mother in New York! "I don't need to tell you that the sentiment of women, especially mothers, against war and in defense of peace is universal. Nothing else can unite them so broadly. Only mothers can foresee the consequences that war will bring to families and children. Even if not all the mothers in the world attend your conference, their hearts are turned to you, and they all extend their best wishes to the conference. American women will also attend the World Mothers' Conference." Comrade Chen Guangyu, a mother of four children from China, wrote an article in her hospital bed to bless the World Mothers' Conference. She said: "When I heard the news on the radio that the World Mothers' Conference had opened in Lausanne, Switzerland, I could not restrain my inner joy and excitement. You—the outstanding representatives of hundreds of millions of mothers around the world, with lofty maternal dignity, great feelings and a sense of responsibility for your children, have gathered in Lausanne to discuss the common issues that all mothers around the world are most concerned about. In the name of an ordinary Chinese woman, in the name of a mother of four children, I bless you and am determined to fight for the implementation of the conference resolutions." This fully proves that the wishes of mothers in the East and West are the same, and the World Mothers' Conference has received the enthusiastic support of the vast number of mothers in the East and West.

(II)

The purpose of this conference is to call on half of humanity's mothers and women to unite closely and take action to defend children, oppose war, strive for disarmament, and strengthen friendship between the people of all countries. Madame Eugénie Cotton's opening speech clarified this position. In the speeches of 119 representatives from various countries and organizations at the conference, and in the speeches of more representatives in various groups and committees, everyone unanimously supported this position. The representatives attending the meeting all expressed a strong call from their own experiences of the suffering of war: "We don't want war!" No one can ever forget all the pain and misfortune that World War II brought to mothers. "More than 40 million people were killed, more than 30 million were injured and disabled, millions of children were orphaned, and millions died of hunger and poverty. How many towns and villages were destroyed, how many homes were destroyed! How many hopes were shattered, how many talented people were sacrificed, how much happiness was destroyed" (Declaration of the World Mothers' Conference). Let us listen to the accusation of Mrs. Yamaguchi Miyoko, the mother representative from Nagasaki, Japan! On August 6, 1945, three days after American imperialism dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, it detonated another atomic bomb in Nagasaki, instantly massacring 200,000 people. In Urakami Mountain (transliteration), the epicenter of the explosion, there was an unspeakable tragedy. People crawled on the ground with torn flesh and severe bleeding, children screamed for their mothers in pain, and mothers hugged other people's bodies as if they were their own children, crying bitterly. Mrs. Yamaguchi Miyoko herself said that two days after the explosion, carrying her two-and-a-half-month pregnancy, she wandered in a city that had been bombed to the point where not a single blade of grass remained, searching for the bodies of her husband and sister in a hellish, scorched wilderness. In an instant, her relatives died, her house was destroyed, and everything was gone. Mrs. Yamaguchi Miyoko took her first child to live in a cave, and her second child was born on a piece of zinc in the middle of the scorched site. At that time, there was not even a piece of cloth or paper. At the World Mothers' Conference, Mrs. Yamaguchi Miyoko strongly demanded: "All Japanese mothers appeal to you to unite with them to protest the manufacture and use of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs."

Let's take another look at the lives of mothers and children in West Germany, who have suffered from the wounds of war! West German mother representative Ilm-Garde Haus (a doctor from Heidelberg, West Germany) said in her speech at the conference: In West Germany, the health of children has greatly deteriorated. Forty percent of the children in Düsseldorf suffer from mental illness. The number of schoolchildren in Hamburg suffering from gastric ulcers, intestinal ulcers, and indigestion has greatly increased. Then, Mrs. Otti Winterol of West Germany accused the crime of approving the Paris Agreement to mothers and children: In just a few weeks, the land of farmers in western West Germany was plundered to build airports, barracks, and shooting ranges; new laws were also passed to conscript young men and women in West Germany into the army commanded by fascist generals. Recently, a new decree was passed to increase rents by 20 percent from September 1955, and the prices of milk and butter also increased at the same time. In particular, the American atomic cannons stored in West Germany will be used for exercises, and many mothers and children have suffered serious threats from this weapon. West German mothers feel extremely uneasy and deeply worried about all this brought about by the Paris Agreement. Many other mother representatives complained that when two-thirds of the people in the world are starving, the wealth created by the hard work of hundreds of millions of people is spent on armaments and on the production of atomic bombs. All this immediately leads to a decline in family income, an increase in disease, and child mortality. The mothers strongly appealed "We don't want war," we must stop new wars to protect the lives and happiness of our children.

The representatives attending the meeting looked happily at the mothers and children of the countries of the socialist and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union. Because the government pursued a peaceful foreign policy, advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems, and strived to carry out peaceful construction, mothers and children enjoyed a peaceful and happy life. The speech of Mrs. Nina Popova of the Soviet Union greatly encouraged the representatives attending the meeting. She recalled the disasters suffered by Soviet mothers in World War II and said: In the post-war period, the Soviet economy and culture have undergone tremendous development, and the living standards of the people have greatly improved. The Soviet government, like a loving and caring mother, gives everything best to children. In the Soviet Union, large sums of money are allocated every year to build schools, nurseries, children's sanatoriums, and summer camps. Compulsory seven-year education has long been established, and compulsory ten-year education is now being implemented. The number of schools is increasing every year. In the Russian Federal Republic alone, more than 5,000 new schools have been established in the past four years. Now is the hot summer. In the vast territory of the Soviet Union, from the Pacific Ocean to the western border, from the cold Arctic to sunny Armenia, this year, more than 5.5 million children will go to various summer camps for vacation. They are happily traveling in groups to parks and sports fields. Millions of children are in sanatoriums and children's resorts, either hiking or sailing on picturesque waters. In the Soviet Union, women as mothers enjoy a high honor. They receive universal respect and care. Nina Afansyeva, a representative of the Soviet Union at the World Mothers' Conference, is a good example. She is a middle-aged woman of forty-eight. Her husband is an architect. They already have ten children and two grandchildren. As a mother in a large family, Nina Afansyeva has received a large amount of subsidies from the state. Her children can also enter sanatoriums or summer camps for free or with very little fees. Four older children have completed their studies and started working. Two are working and studying at the same time. Three children are still in school, and the youngest daughter is living happily in kindergarten. She was also awarded the honorary title of "Mother Heroine." The Soviet Union also creates all conditions so that mothers can not only happily raise their children, but also enjoy the right to work like men, with equal pay for equal work, and enjoy special protection. Countless warm applause welcomed such a speech full of hope and confidence. Finally, all the representatives stood up and cheered to thank the Soviet women for creating a brilliant example of peace and happiness for women all over the world. At the conference, we also heard the report of Mrs. Krasova. She is the mayor of the village of Lidice in Czechoslovakia, which was razed to the ground during World War II. She said: We mothers of Lidice were imprisoned in the Fensburg concentration camp in the most painful moments and in terrible disasters. For three years, we did not know the life or death of our husbands and children. Ninety of our children died in the gas chambers of the concentration camp, one of whom was my child. But now, we mothers of Lidice are liberated. With the help of the Czechoslovak Republic, we have built a new Lidice next to the ruins of the old Lidice. People from thirty countries sent us 17,000 beautiful roses. Each flower symbolizes the close friendship and peaceful wishes between the people. We use such beautiful flowers to build the "Friendship and Peace" garden. Lidice has changed from a symbol of the disasters and suffering of World War II to a symbol of peace and friendship among the people of all countries.

These true facts made the representatives passionately shout: We love children, we love peace, we "want to protect our children from war and ensure them a peaceful and happy future." (Declaration of the World Mothers' Conference)

(III)

Just as Madame Cotton said in her opening speech: "We must not only rely on our motherly nature, but also understand current affairs." The World Mothers' Conference was held at a historically important moment. Thanks to the unremitting efforts of peace-loving people all over the world, and the concerted cooperation of peace-loving countries, adhering to a peaceful foreign policy, in recent months, new hope has emerged for the cause of peace, but on the road to lasting world peace, there are still many obstacles, and the danger of a new war still seriously threatens mothers and children. Therefore, the World Mothers' Conference issued an appeal to the United Nations, which had just celebrated its tenth anniversary, and a letter to the forthcoming summit of the four major powers, expressing the concerns and wishes of half of humanity's mothers and women. They hope that the United Nations will completely fulfill the tasks it undertook at its creation—protecting the growing generation from war. They hope that the summit of the four major powers will achieve results and be successful. They put forward the following important demands: (1) Stop war preparations. (2) Resolve all international disputes through peaceful negotiations, without resorting to force. (3) Establish a collective security system based on the principles of peaceful coexistence adopted at the Bandung Conference. (4) Gradually reduce armaments under supervision, creating conditions for practical and universal disarmament in all countries. (5) Ban and destroy atomic weapons and all weapons of mass destruction. Broadly develop international cooperation and peacefully utilize atomic energy. (6) Develop international cooperation in economic, social, and cultural fields, and promote friendship and understanding between the people of all countries. (7) Condemn any interference in other countries and respect the right of the people of all countries to control their own destiny.

The World Mothers' Conference issued a declaration, warmly hoping that mothers around the world will take concerted action to oppose war and defend peace. "We don't want war," "We now know that war is not inevitable, war can be avoided, and peace can be achieved." (Declaration of the World Mothers' Conference) This is the great determination and confidence that the World Mothers' Conference has announced to the world. Countless causes of justice and peace in the world are accomplished by the power of the people. Women account for half of humanity and contain a great power that cannot be ignored. We have seen the role played by the mass delegations from various countries who went to Geneva in 1954 to demand an end to the Vietnam War, and we have seen that the demands of the masses played a major role in the ceasefire in Korea. In recent months, also because of the efforts of peace-loving people around the world uniting to promote peace, new hope has emerged for the cause of peace. Therefore, the World Mothers' Conference calls on mothers around the world to demand the prohibition and destruction of atomic weapons, and to demand that atomic energy be used only for peaceful purposes; to demand the realization of disarmament, and to use huge military expenditures to build houses, hospitals, schools, and maternity hospitals; to improve the situation of children; to improve people's living standards. To ask mothers all over the world to educate their children to love peace, cherish the people of all countries, and equally protect all children—yellow, white, and black—without any racial prejudice. The World Mothers' Conference further calls on mothers around the world: "To protect our children from war, to strive for disarmament and friendship between the people of all countries, let us ensure that we maintain unity and expand our contacts. There are thousands upon thousands of us. Let us reach out to each other!" The conference finally decided to establish a permanent international committee of mothers to protect children, chaired by Mrs. Andre Andreen, chairman of the Swedish Left-Wing Women's Federation and vice-chairman of the International Democratic Women's Federation, and vice-chairman of the International Preparatory Committee of the World Mothers' Conference, Mrs. Griesmann of West Germany. Representatives will be selected from various countries to serve as members and work under the leadership of the International Democratic Women's Federation to implement the spirit of the World Mothers' Conference. We firmly believe that the vast number of mothers around the world will warmly respond to the great call of the World Mothers' Conference. The peaceful will of mothers is strong, the power of unity is invincible, and peace can certainly be achieved.

(IV)

The entire members of the Chinese delegation attending this conference expressed the firm will for peace of Chinese mothers and the Chinese people, and the deep friendship to mothers and peoples of all countries, through speeches at the conference, various committees, and various panel discussions, through the extra-curricular gatherings with delegations from 21 countries participating in the conference, and through the ten interviews, inscriptions, speeches, etc. published in several newspapers and radio stations. Due to the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution, the great achievements of China's peaceful construction, and the great increase in China's international status, the speeches of the Chinese delegation at the conference were warmly welcomed by the representatives attending the meeting, and the opinions of the Chinese delegation were respected by the representatives of all countries. All members of our delegation received a profound education in patriotism and internationalism. We love our motherland more, and we understand more deeply the important responsibility in maintaining world peace.

Our Chinese mothers have always loved peace and actively striven for and defended world peace. All the representatives of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China discussed and approved the first Five-Year Plan and the comprehensive plan for the fundamental treatment and development of the Yellow River with great joy and full confidence, doing "great things for the happiness of the people of the whole country and future generations." We firmly believe that the victorious development of China's peaceful construction will further strengthen the power of the world to defend peace; at the same time, only by striving for an international peaceful environment can we smoothly carry out and complete China's peaceful construction plan. Let us, the mothers of the whole country and the people of the whole country, unite more closely under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the State Council of the People's Republic of China, and contribute all our strength to complete and overfulfill China's first Five-Year Plan, thereby creating the most important conditions for further easing international tensions, defending world peace, and protecting children. Let us further join hands closely with mothers from all countries around the world, under the banner of the International Democratic Women's Federation, to contribute greater strength and strive for greater achievements in order to implement the resolutions of the World Mothers' Conference and defend peace and protect children.

Long live world peace!
Long live the great unity of mothers around the world!

    关于洛桑世界母亲大会的情况和成就的报告
    ——一九五五年八月十日在北京市第三届妇女代表大会上
    中国出席世界母亲大会代表团团长　李德全亲爱的同志们，亲爱的姊妹们！
    我们代表团接受全中国母亲和妇女们的委托，出席了七月七日到十日在瑞士洛桑举行的世界母亲大会，在七月下旬已分批回国。请允许我将大会的主要情况及其成就转达给大家。
    （一）
    世界母亲大会的举行及其胜利闭幕，是国际生活中一件大事，是母亲们、妇女们为保卫和平、保卫孩子的伟大集会，是母亲们、妇女们争取世界持久和平斗争中的重要的里程碑。
    这次大会是由一九五四年十一月在柏林举行的国际民主妇女联合会执行委员会会议建议召开的。今年二月国际民主妇女联合会在日内瓦举行的理事会扩大会议上一致通过了“告世界母亲书”，大力号召全世界母亲们积极参加即将在七月举行的世界母亲大会。会后并成立了以卓越的和平战士欧仁妮·戈登夫人为主席的国际筹备委员会，广泛团结各国知名的妇女组织和个人，参与筹备工作。
    召开世界母亲大会的建议，得到了全世界母亲们、妇女们的热烈拥护和全力支持。在全世界大多数国家里，广泛展开了筹备工作。有些国家，如法国、芬兰、巴西等国家成立了有广泛代表性的筹备委员会，在广大母亲和妇女中展开了筹备和庆贺世界母亲大会的工作。有些国家，如波兰、西德、日本、意大利、奥地利、哥斯达黎加等国召开了全国规模的或各个地区的母亲大会，团结了各种不同政治见解的妇女、母亲，充分表达了反对战争、要求和平的坚强的意志。还有些国家，如朝鲜、印度、印度尼西亚等国举行了“母亲日”“母亲月”。很多国家，结合“三八”国际妇女节、“六一”国际儿童节及为反对原子战争而在世界和平理事会“告全世界人民书”上签名的运动，在群众中广泛开展了世界母亲大会的宣传、筹备工作。从而在全世界各洲掀起了母亲们、妇女们保卫孩子、保卫和平的热潮。
    出席这次大会的代表是非常广泛的，共有六十六个国家一千零六十人，其中有正式代表九百六十四名，列席代表二十三名，来宾七十三名。这里还包含十三个国际组织的代表及列席人员。这是在母爱鼓舞下的伟大的会晤，代表中有八百二十五位母亲，有些母亲有十一个、十三个孩子，有一位母亲有十五个孩子。有二十岁的青年母亲，也有六十岁以上的老母亲、老祖母以至曾祖母。许多母亲身受着战争的惨重的灾害，有些是经历过第二次世界大战灾难的母亲们，有些是对于战争惨状记忆犹新的母亲们，有些是受尽了剥削镇压的殖民地半殖民地国家的母亲们，有些是因为政府扩军备战吞没巨额经费，在生活上受尽磨难的母亲们。她们来自不同制度的国家，属于不同的种族，长着不同的肤色，有着不同的政治见解和宗教信仰，有着不同的职业和社会地位，代表着不同的组织，其中有六百五十三位代表是第一次参加国际会议，还有平时很少参加社会、政治活动的三百七十二名家庭主妇。
    这次大会的广泛性还表现在获得了全世界知名人士和广大母亲与妇女的热烈支持，七十九个国家的妇女组织及知名妇女，撰文支持大会或向大会致贺，大会收到来自各国的二千余封贺电贺词。比利时伊丽莎白皇太后为大会撰写了动人的贺词：“我以极其激动的心情欢迎召开世界母亲大会的建议。在热烈赞同这个想法时，我希望全世界母爱的力量将会战胜罪恶、仇恨及其最卑劣的一面——战争，那意味着人类毁灭的原子战争。”大会还收到了一些著名学者们的贺词，其中有法国的诺贝尔奖金的获得者约里奥—居里夫人、苏联医药科学院院士列皮辛斯卡雅夫人。还收到我国“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金获得者、卓越和平战士、全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长宋庆龄，德国伟大作家安娜·西格斯夫人，印度卫生部部长考尔夫人、国会议员乌玛·尼赫鲁夫人，美国“拯救我们的儿子”委员会主席弗洛伦斯·高基尔夫人的支持大会的文章和贺电。此外还有其他很多团体、个人的贺词，让我们读一位纽约母亲的来信吧！“我用不着告诉你们说，妇女、特别是母亲们反对战争、保卫和平的情绪是普遍存在的。没有任何别的东西可以这样广泛地把她们团结起来。只有母亲才能预见战争所带给家庭和孩子的后果。即使并不是世界上所有的母亲都出席了你们的大会，但是她们的心都转向你们，她们都对大会致以最佳的愿望。美国妇女同样也将出席世界母亲大会。”我国一位四个孩子的母亲——陈光玉同志在产床上撰文祝福世界母亲大会，她说：“当我从无线电广播里听到了世界母亲大会在瑞士洛桑开幕的消息，我抑制不住内心的喜悦和激动。你们——全世界亿万母亲的卓越代表，以崇高的母性尊严，对子女伟大的感情和责任感，齐集洛桑商讨全世界所有母亲所最关切的共同问题。我以一个中国普通妇女的名义，以一个四个孩子的母亲名义，向你们祝福，并决心为实现大会决议而斗争。”这充分证明了东、西方母亲的心愿是共同的，世界母亲大会是得到东、西方广大母亲的热烈支持的。
    （二）
    这次大会的目的，是号召人类半数的母亲和妇女紧密地团结起来，行动起来，保卫孩子，反对战争，争取裁减军备和加强各国人民之间的友谊。欧仁妮·戈登夫人的开幕词，阐明了这种主张。在大会发言的一百十九位各国的各种组织的代表，在各小组各委员会中有更多代表的发言，大家一致拥护这种主张。与会的代表都从亲身经历的战争苦难中，发出了坚强的呼声：“我们不要战争！”谁也永远不能忘掉第二次世界大战给母亲们带来了一切痛苦和不幸。“四千多万人被杀害，三千多万人受伤残废，成百万孩子成为孤儿，成百万人死于饥饿和贫困，多少城镇和乡村被毁灭，多少家园被破坏！多少希望破灭了，多少有才能的人牺牲了，多少幸福被破坏了”（世界母亲大会宣言）。让我们听听日本长崎的母亲代表山口美代子夫人的控诉吧！一九四五年八月六日美国帝国主义在广岛投掷原子弹以后三天，又在长崎爆炸了原子弹，瞬息之间屠杀了二十万人，在爆炸中心的浦上山（译音），出现了惨绝人寰的悲剧。人们带着皮肉撕裂和剧烈流血的痛苦在地上爬行，孩子们在疼痛中狂叫妈妈，妈妈们把别人的尸体当作自己孩子，紧抱着痛哭。山口美代子夫人自己说，在爆炸后的两天，她带着两个半月的身孕，徘徊在炸得连一棵草也没有的城市，在地狱式的烧焦了的旷野里，找寻自己的丈夫和妹妹的尸体。一瞬之间亲人死掉了，房屋炸毁了，什么都没有了，山口美代子夫人携带着第一个孩子住在山洞，第二个孩子就诞生在烧焦了场地中间的一块锌板上，当时连一块布一张纸也没有。在世界母亲大会上，山口美代子夫人强烈地要求：“所有日本母亲们向你们呼吁，和她们联合起来抗议制造和使用原子弹、氢弹。”
    我们再看看饱受战争创伤的西德母亲和孩子们的生活吧！西德母亲代表伊尔姆—加尔德·豪斯夫人（西德海得尔堡医生）在大会发言时说：在西德，儿童的健康状况大大恶化了。杜塞尔多夫城百分之四十的儿童患着神经病。汉堡城患胃溃疡、肠溃疡和消化不良症的学童大为增加。接着，西德奥提·温特罗尔夫人控诉了批准巴黎协定带给母亲、儿童的罪行：仅仅几周之内，西德西部的农民的土地被劫夺了，用来建筑飞机场、兵营、射击场；又通过了新的法律，把西德男女青年征集到法西斯将军们所指挥的军队里去。最近又通过了新的法令，从一九五五年九月起，将房租增加百分之二十，牛奶牛油也同时加价。特别是储存在西德的美国原子炮，将被用来演习，多少母亲和儿童已遭受着这种武器的严重威胁。西德母亲们为巴黎协定带来的这一切而感到极端的不安和深重的忧虑。还有许多母亲代表申诉了当世界上三分之二的人们正在挨饿，而亿万人辛勤劳动的财富却耗费在军备上，耗费在原子弹的生产上。这一切立即带来的是家庭收入下降，疾病增涨，儿童死亡。母亲们坚强的呼吁“我们不要战争”，我们必须制止新的战争，来保卫孩子们的生命和幸福。
    到会的代表们以幸福的眼光注视着以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营的各国的母亲、儿童。由于政府奉行了和平外交政策，倡议不同制度的国家和平共处，努力进行和平建设，母亲和儿童享受了和平幸福的生活。苏联尼娜·波波娃夫人的发言，给到会代表极大鼓舞。她追述了苏联母亲在第二次世界大战中遭受的灾难以后说：在战后的时期，苏联的经济、文化已经有了巨大发展，人民的生活水平大大提高。苏联政府正像一位亲爱关切的母亲，把一切最好的东西给予了孩子们。在苏联，每年拨出大笔款项来建设学校、托儿所、儿童疗养院、夏令营。七年制的义务教育早就确立了，现在正在实行十年制的义务教育。学校数目每年增加，单在俄罗斯联邦共和国，最近四年内就新设立了五千多所学校。现在正值酷热的夏季，在苏联辽阔的国土上，从太平洋到西部国境，从寒冷的北极到阳光普照的亚美尼亚，今年，将有五百五十多万儿童到各种夏令营去度假日，他们兴高采烈，成群结队地到公园和运动场去。几百万孩子在疗养院、儿童休养所，他们或者远足旅行，或者在美丽如画的水面上驶船。在苏联，妇女作为母亲享有很高的荣誉，她们受到普遍的尊敬和关怀。苏联出席世界母亲大会的代表尼娜·阿芬斯依娃，就是一个很好的例证。她是一个四十八岁的中年人，丈夫是建筑家，他们已经有十个孩子和两个孙子，尼娜·阿芬斯依娃作为一个大家庭里的母亲，她已得到国家的大量的津贴。她的孩子还可以免费或缴很少费用进疗养院或夏令营，四个大孩子已经完成了学习，走上工作岗位，两个正在一面工作一面学习，三个孩子还在上学，最小的女儿正在幼儿园中活泼地生活着。她又被奖为光荣的“母亲英雄”。苏联还创造一切条件，不仅使母亲们能幸福地抚育自己的子女，而且和男子同样能享受工作权利，同工同酬，并享有特殊的保护。无数次的热烈的掌声，迎接着这样一个充满着希望与信心的发言，最后全体代表用起立欢呼来答谢苏联妇女为全世界妇女创造了和平幸福的光辉榜样。在大会上又听到了克拉索娃夫人的报告。她是在第二次世界大战期间被夷为平地的捷克斯洛伐克的利台斯村的村长。她说：我们利台斯的母亲，曾在最痛苦的时刻，在可怕的灾难中，被关进芬斯布鲁克集中营。我们曾经三年不明丈夫和孩子的生死，我们九十个孩子死在集中营的瓦斯室里，其中就有一个是我的孩子。但是我们现在，利台斯的母亲解放了，有了捷克斯洛伐克共和国，帮助我们在旧利台斯的废墟旁，建成了新的利台斯。三十个国家的人民给我们利台斯村送来了一万七千朵美丽的玫瑰花，每一朵花都象征着人民间亲密的友谊与和平的愿望。我们就用这样美丽的花朵，建设了“友谊与和平”花园。利台斯由从前的第二次世界大战的灾祸与苦难的象征，变为各国人民的和平、友好的象征。
    这些千真万确的事实，使代表们热情奔放地喊出：我们爱孩子，我们爱和平，我们“要保护我们的孩子免遭战争，保证他们有一个和平和幸福的将来。”（世界母亲大会宣言）

    正像戈登夫人在开幕词中所说的：“我们不单要依靠我们母亲的天性，并且也要通晓时事。”世界母亲大会是在历史上极重要的时刻举行的，由于全世界爱好和平的人民不懈的努力，由于爱好和平国家的协力合作，坚持和平外交政策，最近几个月来，和平事业出现了新的希望，但是在争取世界持久和平的道路上，还有着重重的阻碍，新战争的危险依旧严重地威胁着母亲和孩子。所以世界母亲大会向当时刚刚庆祝过十周年纪念的联合国发出了呼吁书，向当时即将举行四大国政府首脑会议发出了信，表达了占人类半数的母亲和妇女的忧虑和愿望，她们希望联合国组织彻底完成它在创立时所承担的任务——保卫正在成长的一代免遭战争。她们希望四大国政府首脑会议获得成果并富有成功。她们提出了下列几项重要的要求，这就是：（一）停止战争准备。（二）以和平谈判方式解决一切国际争端，不诉诸武力。（三）根据万隆会议通过的和平共处的原则，建立集体安全体系。（四）有监督地逐步地裁减军备，为各国切实地普遍地裁军创造条件。（五）禁止和销毁原子武器和各种大规模毁灭性武器。广泛发展国际合作，和平利用原子能。（六）发展在经济、社会、文化方面的国际合作，增进各国人民之间的友好和谅解。（七）谴责对别国的任何干涉，尊重各国人民自己掌握自己命运的权利。
    世界母亲大会发表了宣言，热烈希望全世界的母亲，采取一致行动，反对战争、保卫和平。“我们不要战争”“我们现在知道，战争不是不可避免的，战争是可以避免的，和平是可以获得的。”（世界母亲大会宣言）这就是世界母亲大会向全世界宣布的伟大决心和信心。世界上无数正义与和平事业，都是依靠人民力量来完成的，妇女占人类的半数，蕴藏着不可轻忽的伟大力量。我们看到了一九五四年赴日内瓦要求结束越南战争的各国群众代表团所起的作用，我们看到朝鲜的所以能够停战，群众的要求起了重大的作用。最近几个月来，也由于全世界爱好和平人民团结起来促进和平的努力，和平事业才出现了新的希望，所以世界母亲大会号召全世界的母亲，要求禁止和销毁原子武器，要求把原子能只用于和平用途；要求实现裁减军备，把巨额军费用来建设住宅、医院、学校和产科医院；用来改善孩子们的境遇；用来提高人们的生活水平。要求全世界各国母亲教育孩子热爱和平，珍爱各国人民，平等地保护一切儿童——黄种、白种和黑种的儿童，不要存有种族歧视的偏见。世界母亲大会进一步号召全世界母亲“为了保卫我们的孩子免遭战争，为了争取裁军和各国人民之间的友好，让我们保证保持团结和扩大我们的联系。我们人数有千千万万，让我们互相伸出手来吧！”大会最后并决定成立国际母亲保卫儿童常设委员会。由瑞典左翼妇联主席兼国际民主妇联副主席安德烈·安德琳夫人任主席，世界母亲大会国际筹备委员会书记、西德的格丽斯曼夫人任副主席。并由各国选派代表担任委员，在国际民主妇联领导下，为贯彻世界母亲大会的精神，而进行工作。我们深信，全世界广大母亲们必将热烈响应世界母亲大会的伟大的号召。母亲们的和平意志是坚强的，团结的力量是不可战胜的，和平是一定可以取得的。

    出席这次大会的我国代表团的全体成员，分别通过在大会、各个委员会和各个小组会上的发言，通过了与参加大会二十一个国家代表团的会外的联欢活动，通过了对若干报刊、广播电台发表的十次谈话、题词、演讲等等，表达了中国母亲和中国人民的坚强的和平意志，以及对各国母亲和人民的深厚的友谊。由于我国人民革命的伟大胜利，由于我国和平建设的伟大成就，由于我国的国际地位大大提高，我国代表团在大会的发言，受到了与会代表的热烈欢迎，我国代表团的意见，得到了各国代表的尊重。我们代表团全体成员，受到了一次深刻的爱国主义和国际主义教育，我们更加热爱我们的祖国，我们更加懂得在维护世界和平事业中的重大责任。
    我们中国母亲一贯热爱和平，积极为争取和保卫世界和平而奋斗。中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议的全体代表，怀着极大的喜悦和饱满的信心，讨论并通过了第一个五年计划以及根治和开发黄河的综合规划，做着“为全国人民和后世子孙谋幸福的大事”。我们深信，我国和平建设事业的胜利发展，就能更加强全世界保卫和平的力量；同时也只有争取一个国际和平环境，才能顺利地进行和完成我国的和平建设计划。让我们全国母亲和全国人民一起更加紧密地团结起来，在中国共产党和中华人民共和国国务院领导之下，为完成和超额完成我国第一个五年计划而贡献自己的一切力量，由此来为进一步缓和国际紧张局势，保卫世界和平、保卫孩子创造最重要的条件。让我们更进一步和全世界各国母亲亲密地携起手来，在国际民主妇联的旗帜下，为实现世界母亲大会的决议，为保卫和平、保卫孩子而贡献更大的力量，争取更重大的成就。
    世界和平万岁！
    全世界母亲大团结万岁！
