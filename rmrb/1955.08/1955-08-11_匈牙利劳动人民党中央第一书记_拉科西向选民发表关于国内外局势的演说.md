Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 10th: Budapest dispatch: Mátyás Rákosi, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party and Member of the Hungarian National Assembly, delivered a speech to his constituents in the Csepel district of Budapest on the afternoon of August 8th.

	Rákosi first spoke about the international situation. He said that the resolute and consistent initiative shown by the Soviet Union in easing international tensions and consolidating peace was very important for the success of the Geneva Four-Power Heads of Government Conference. All the Hungarian people welcome the Geneva Conference with joy and are supporting the desire to implement the resolutions of the conference in various ways.

	In his speech, Rákosi attached great importance to relations with Yugoslavia. He said that we all realize that friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia will promote the cause of world peace, which is in the interests of the working people and the international workers' movement. Therefore, the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party and the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic gladly and satisfactorily welcome and support the friendly cooperative relations established between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.

	Rákosi continued, "Now we are all very clear that all the disputes, abnormal states, and accusations that undermined the good relations between Hungary and Yugoslavia after 1948 only benefited the enemies of peace and socialism and harmed the common interests of the two countries. The hostile and provocative activities of Peter Gabor, who was in charge of the Hungarian state security organs, and his gang played an important role in creating this situation, which is the deterioration of relations between Hungary and Yugoslavia. Gabor and his accomplices have been tried by the Hungarian court and punished as they deserved. Today, now that we have seen all this clearly, we will do our best to improve relations between Hungary and Yugoslavia. Both sides have taken several effective steps in this direction, and the beneficial results of these steps can already be felt. But the common interests of our two countries urgently require us to make greater efforts in this regard."

	Rákosi then spoke about the economic situation in Hungary. He said that as a result of the mistakes made by Imre Nagy, industrial production basically did not progress much last year. In the past six months, thanks to the measures taken by the party and the government, the total output of socialist industry has increased by 9.5% compared with the same period in 1954. The industrial enterprises managed by the ministries have completed an average of 104.2% of the plan for these six months.

	When talking about the agricultural situation, Rákosi pointed out that, according to preliminary estimates, the harvest of all grains this year will greatly exceed that of 1954. Various crops will also have a good harvest. This year, the planting area of ​​corn has increased by 150,000 holds compared with last year, and the planting area of ​​rice has increased by 15,000 holds. The good prospects for this year's harvest make it possible to increase the supply of meat, especially pork. At present, the number of pigs has increased to an unprecedented level of more than 7 million.

	Rákosi pointed out that the production cooperation movement has begun to flourish across the country. As of August 1st, more than 30,000 new members have joined agricultural producers' cooperatives this year, while in the past two years, the number of cooperatives and their members had decreased. The reason why the cooperative movement has developed in this way is that this year the harvest of agricultural producers' cooperatives and state-owned farms across the country has almost exceeded the average harvest of individual farmers. Rákosi said that we must support the production cooperation movement in every possible way and strive to make more individual farmers voluntarily embark on the path of collective farming.

	Rákosi continued, if the guiding and leading role of the revolutionary party of the working class—the Hungarian Working People's Party—had not been strengthened as the party pointed out in the decisions of the March Plenary Session, then this economic progress would not have been possible. The discipline of the party has been strengthened, and therefore, the discipline of the working class and all working people has also been strengthened. The leadership of the party has become more consolidated and more united. It is generally believed that we are resolutely and unwaveringly advancing along the road of building socialism. The main condition for improving the work of the party is to carry out bold criticism and self-criticism as the party teaches.

	Rákosi finally said that our task is to continue to work side by side with our liberator, the Soviet Union, the great People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries on the road to socialism. We have achieved success on this road, which is a direct road to victory!

    匈牙利劳动人民党中央第一书记
    拉科西向选民发表关于国内外局势的演说
    新华社布拉格十日电　布达佩斯消息：匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会第一书记、匈牙利国民议会议员马·拉科西八日下午在布达佩斯市蔡佩尔区向他的选民发表了演说。
    拉科西首先谈的是国际局势。他说，苏联在缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平方面所表现的坚决而一贯的主动性，对于日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的成功是非常重要的。全体匈牙利人民都怀着愉快的心情欢迎日内瓦会议，并且正以种种方法支持执行会议的决议的愿望。
    拉科西在他的演说中十分重视同南斯拉夫的关系。他说，我们都认识到，苏南的友好合作将促进世界和平事业，这是符合于劳动人民的利益、国际工人运动的利益的。因此，匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会和匈牙利人民共和国政府欣然、满意地欢迎和支持苏联和南斯拉夫之间建立的友好合作关系。
    拉科西接着说，现在我们大家已很清楚，一九四八年以后破坏匈牙利和南斯拉夫两国之间的良好关系的一切争论、不正常状态和指责，只对和平和社会主义的敌人有利并且损害了两国的共同利益。曾负责匈牙利国家保安机构的彼得·高伯尔以及他的一伙人的敌对和挑拨活动，在造成这种局势，也就是匈牙利和南斯拉夫的关系的恶化方面起了重要的作用。高伯尔和他的同谋者已由匈牙利法庭加以审讯并且处以应得之罪。今天，我们大家既看清楚了这一切，我们将竭尽全力来改善匈牙利和南斯拉夫两国之间的关系。双方已朝着这个方向采取了若干有成效的步骤，这种步骤的有益的结果已经可以感觉到。但是我们两国的共同利益迫切地要求我们在这方面作更大的努力。
    拉科西然后谈到匈牙利的经济情况。他说，由于伊·纳吉犯错误的结果，去年的工业生产基本上没有什么进展。在过去六个月中，由于党和政府所采取的措施，社会主义工业总产量比一九五四年同时期增加了百分之九点五。由各部管理的工业企业平均完成了这六个月的计划的百分之一百零四点二。
    拉科西在谈到农业情况时指出，据初步估计，今年一切谷物的收获量将大大超过一九五四年。各种作物也将会得到很好的收成。今年玉蜀黍的种植面积比去年增加了十五万霍尔德，大米的种植面积增加了一万五千霍尔德。今年收成的良好前景使得有可能增加肉类、特别是猪肉的供应量。目前，猪的头数已空前地增加到七百万头以上。
    拉科西指出，生产合作运动已开始在全国蓬勃展开了。到八月一日为止，今年已经有三万多新社员参加了农业生产合作社，而在去年和前年，合作社的数目和它们的社员数目都曾减少。合作运动所以得到这种发展，是由于今年全国的农业生产合作社和国营农场的收获量几乎都超过了个体农民的平均收获量。拉科西说，我们必须用一切办法来支持生产合作运动，并且争取使更多的个体农民自愿地走上集体耕作的道路。
    拉科西继续说，如果工人阶级的革命政党——匈牙利劳动人民党——的指导和领导作用没有像党在三月全体会议的决定中所指出的那样得到加强，那末，这种经济进展是不可能实现的。党的纪律已经加强了，因此，工人阶级、全体劳动人民的纪律也加强了。党的领导变得更加坚固、更加团结了，人们普遍认为，我们正在坚决地、毫不动摇地沿着建设社会主义的道路前进。改进党的工作的主要条件就是像党所教导的那样展开大胆的批评和自我批评。
    拉科西最后说，我们的任务就是继续同我们的解放者苏联，同伟大的中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家在通往社会主义的道路上并肩努力。我们已经在这条道路上取得了成就，这是一条直接通向胜利的道路！
