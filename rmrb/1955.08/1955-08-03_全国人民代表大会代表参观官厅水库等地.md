Xinhua News Agency report:

    After the conclusion of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, the deputies visited Guanting Reservoir, China's largest artificial lake, the Yongding River Guanting Hydropower Station, the first hydropower station in North China which is under construction, and the Fengtai-Shacheng railway line, which recently officially opened to traffic, on July 31st. At the break of dawn, the deputies boarded two special trains and headed towards Guanting Reservoir along the old Beijing-Baotou railway line. Here, the deputies viewed the reservoir's famous dam, water diversion channels, and spillway projects. Many people stood on the platform of the water intake tower, overlooking the "Guanting Lake" scenery. The rolling yellow water of the Yongding River, known as the "Little Yellow River," flowing into the reservoir, had already turned a greenish hue. Many deputies believed during the visit that soil and water conservation is a very important task for fundamentally controlling water disasters. On the east bank of the reservoir, the deputies visited the Guanting Hydropower Station's intake canal, inlet, and water blocking gate, and then visited the hydropower station's plant. The deputies believed that absorbing the experiences and lessons from the construction of the Guanting Reservoir and Hydropower Station would greatly help in fundamentally controlling and developing the Yellow River and other rivers. In the afternoon, the deputies boarded two special trains again and traveled from Shacheng to Sanjiadian, visiting the most important section of the Fengsha Line. The train passed through Tunnel No. 65 and entered the Yongding River Canyon, crossing the turbulent Yongding River eight times. On this stretch of only 62 kilometers, it passed through 65 tunnels, almost every kilometer requiring passage through 227 meters of tunnel. When the deputies passed through the longest tunnel in China, which was five li long, they couldn't help but cheer. While passing through a tunnel known as the "Heroic Tunnel," the deputies inquired with the train staff about the arduous deeds of the railway workers in building this line. It was during the construction of this tunnel that hidden counter-revolutionary element Dong Diankai carried out serious sabotage activities. The deputies were very angry about this, believing that it was necessary to heighten vigilance and resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary elements.

    全国人民代表大会代表参观官厅水库等地
    据新华社讯　出席第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议的代表们在会议闭幕后，于七月三十一日参观了我国最大的人工湖——官厅水库、正在建设的华北第一个水电站——永定河官厅水电站和最近正式通车的丰（台）沙（城）线的铁路工程。天刚拂晓，代表们就分乘两列专车，沿着京包铁路旧线，前往官厅水库参观。在这里，代表们观看了水库著名的拦河坝、输水道和溢洪道等工程。许多人站在输水道的进口——进水塔的平台上，眺望“官厅湖”景。号称“小黄河”的永定河的滚滚黄水，流入水库，已呈一片青绿之色。许多代表在参观时认为，要根治水害，水土保持是一件非常重要的工作。在水库东岸，代表们参观了官厅水电站进水渠、进水口和堵水闸门，然后参观了水电站的厂房。代表们认为，吸收官厅水库和水电站的建设中经验教训，对根治和开发黄河及其他河流工作有很大帮助。午后，代表们又分乘两列专车，从沙城到三家店，参观丰沙线上的最重要的一段工程。列车穿过六十五号隧道，就进入永定河山峡，它八次跨越了水流湍急的永定河。在这段仅六十二公里的途中，它就穿过了六十五座隧道，差不多每行驶一公里，就要穿过二百二十七公尺的隧道。当代表们穿过长达五华里的、在我国最长的一座隧道时，他们不禁欢呼起来。在通过一座被称为“英雄的隧道”时，代表们纷纷向火车上的工作人员了解了铁路工人如何艰苦地修筑这条线的事迹。就在修筑这个隧道时，暗藏的反革命分子董殿凯曾进行严重的破坏活动。代表们对此非常愤怒，认为必须提高警惕，坚决镇压反革命分子。
