The Guoqian Banner had 328 agricultural production cooperatives implementing a short-term contracting system during the spring plowing preparation period. However, by the early stages of sowing, only 196 cooperatives had maintained the contracting system, and by the time of summer weeding, only 93 cooperatives were able to continue it. Most cooperatives had discontinued it. For example, in the Second District, out of 52 cooperatives, 34 implemented a short-term contracting system during the preparation for spring plowing, but by the summer weeding season, none of them were contracting. Even in key cooperatives led by the banner and district committees, this contracting system was only implemented for a period and not sustained. Many cooperatives still used the methods from the mutual aid group era, temporarily assigning tasks and subjectively evaluating work, and some even failed to execute the "subjective evaluation" well. Labor organization was chaotic, labor calculation was unreasonable, and the phenomena of wasted work and idleness were serious. The enthusiasm of the cooperative members could not be fully mobilized, and production was affected to some extent.

Although the implementation of a short-term contracting system cannot completely solve the problems in labor management, it still has a certain effect in overcoming some of the chaotic phenomena in collective production. In many cooperatives in Guoqian Banner, before the contracting system, tasks were assigned temporarily every day, labor organization was chaotic, work points were evaluated and recorded unreasonably, and the phenomena of wasted work and idleness were serious. In many cooperatives, it was a case of "cooperative members not getting up early, and the director going door to door to find them." After the contracting system, the phenomena of wasted work and idleness were reduced, labor calculation was also more reasonable, and the enthusiasm of the cooperative members was mobilized to a certain extent. This shows that the implementation of short-term contracting has certain benefits. However, these experiences were not summarized and disseminated in a timely manner, and many cooperatives only implemented it for a short time before discontinuing it again.

Why couldn't many agricultural cooperatives in Guoqian Banner persist in implementing a short-term contracting system?

First, the core members of the cooperatives had conservative ideas. They were accustomed to the scattered and individual operating methods and were not good at adopting new operating methods according to the new situation after cooperation. They believed that the contracting system was a "troublesome matter" and an "extra burden." Some said: "We can work with or without contracting, why bother with this extra step?" Some said: "I'm a roughneck, implementing the contracting system requires planning and accounting, it's better to just work one day at a time and not worry about it!" Some people admitted in principle that contracting had benefits, and also felt that labor was more organized after contracting, but when they encountered difficulties and obstacles in the specific implementation, they could not persist. They put forward many reasons why it was impossible to contract: the preparatory work was fragmented and not easy to contract, spring sowing was chaotic and inaccurate and would exhaust the horses, summer weeding had frequent rains and no standard quotas, autumn harvest work was miscellaneous and contracting easily led to disregard for quality, causing losses, seedlings were uneven during droughts and there was no way to contract, weeds and seedlings grew evenly during rains and there was no way to contract... In short, it was difficult to contract and calculate work points in all seasons of the year. In addition, although the cooperative members were not satisfied with the phenomena of wasted work and idleness, they did not understand the benefits of contracting enough, and believed that contracting by team, if your team got more and my team got less, it would be unfair, it was better to just work one day at a time. Some cooperative members who were physically weak and did not work well were even more reluctant to contract, fearing that they could not keep up. Without resolving these ideological obstacles, it was difficult to promote the contracting system.

Second, the district and township staff underestimated the difficulties in promoting the contracting system and did not provide enough specific assistance, and did not often pay attention to solving the difficulties encountered in contracting. They often "threw the baby out with the bathwater," and stopped contracting when they encountered some problems and obstacles. Agricultural production cooperatives had plots of land that were far and near, good and bad, labor forces that were strong and weak, technologies that were high and low, and the agricultural season and climate were complex and variable. In the arrangement and calculation of farm work in contracting, many problems would be encountered. If obstacles could not be broken in a timely manner, it would be difficult to implement and adhere to contracting. For example, when the Fourth Cooperative of Balang Village in the Second District was plowing sorghum land, it was divided into two teams for contracting. Because the stipulated contracting standards had problems, the work done by one team was similar to the work done by the other team, but the work points earned by each person differed by half. The members of this team were extremely dissatisfied, saying, "Contracting has made us lose money." The problem was not resolved in a timely manner, so they stopped contracting. The members of the First Cooperative of Shangtaizi Village could not calculate the contracting accounts clearly until midnight, and the members said dissatisfiedly: "Getting a few extra work points is not enough to compensate for the delay in sleeping, let's not contract, let's just get by!" In this way, the contracting was interrupted. The banner and district staff lacked experience and confidence in the implementation of the contracting system by agricultural cooperatives. For example, a district committee in the Second District said: "The contracting system is something that the district cadres don't know, and the village cadres pretend to understand." Of the 12 district committee members in the entire district, only the district committee secretary knew how to contract, six and a half knew half of it, and five didn't know anything at all. Because they didn't know it themselves, it was difficult for them to help solve the specific problems encountered by the cooperatives in contracting. Sun Fumin, the secretary of the party branch of Beishangtai Village in the Second District, said: "We just shouted about contracting, but we didn't help a single cooperative to make a model, and as a result, none of the six cooperatives contracted well." In addition, the banner and district staff were overbearing and did not pay attention to summarizing and disseminating experiences, teaching the core members of the cooperatives to learn the contracting methods. Often, the contracting would stop as soon as they left. Some cooperative members said: "The cadres came and contracted, the cadres left and it was all for nothing, the core members of the cooperative were confused."

In order to help agricultural production cooperatives persist in implementing the short-term contracting system, the Guoqian Banner Party Committee plans to start by inspecting and analyzing the situation and problems in the implementation of the contracting system in the previous period, summarizing experiences, learning lessons, educating all rural staff, recognizing the role of implementing contracting in leading collective production, overcoming the "fear of trouble" thinking of some staff, and in the process of inspection and summary, helping district and township staff learn how to run cooperatives and how to contract. Second, in the process of promoting the contracting system, it is necessary to learn from the lessons of the previous period, change the practice of only making general appeals without helping to solve specific problems, and deeply and frequently help some agricultural cooperatives solve the problems encountered in contracting. On this basis, gradually accumulate experience, establish banners, and enable the contracting system to be gradually promoted from point to surface, and gradually improved from temporary to long-term.

    郭前旗旗委研究有些农业合作社不能坚持实行包工制的经验教训
    郭农
    在春耕准备时期，郭前旗有三百二十八个农业生产合作社实行了短期包工制。但是到播种初期，只有一百九十六个社的包工坚持下来了，到进入夏锄时，却只有九十三个社能坚持包工，多数社中断了。如二区五十二个社，在备耕时有三十四个社实行了短期包工，到夏锄时就都不包了。就连旗、区委领导的重点社，这种包工制也只实行了一个时期，没有坚持下来。不少社还是采用互助组时的办法，临时派工，死分活评，有些连“活评”也没能很好执行。劳动组织混乱，劳动计算不合理，窝工浪费现象严重，社员劳动积极性不能充分发挥，生产也受到一定影响。
    实行短期包工制，虽然还不能完全解决劳动管理方面的问题，但对于克服集体生产中的某些混乱现象还是有一定作用的。郭前旗有不少社，包工前天天临时派工，劳动组织混乱，评工记分不合理，窝工浪费现象严重。有许多社是“社员不起早，主任挨家找”。包工后窝工浪费现象减少了，劳动计算也比较合理了，社员的积极性也得到了一定发挥，这说明实行短期包工是有一定好处的。但是这些经验并没有及时得到总结和传播，许多社只实行了一时就又中断了。
    郭前旗的许多农业合作社为什么不能坚持实行短期包工呢？
    首先，是社的骨干分子有保守思想。他们习惯于分散的个体的经营方法，不善于按照合作起来以后的新情况采用新的经营方法，认为包工制是“麻烦事”，是“额外负担”。有的说：“包也能干，不包也能干，何必多此一举？”有的说：“我是大老粗，实行包工制又是计划又是算账，不如干一天说一天省心！”有些人虽然道理上承认包工有好处，包了以后也觉得劳动有秩序，但在具体实行中遇到困难和阻碍时，就又不能坚持了。他们提出很多不能包的理由：备耕工作活计零碎不好包，春播地乱包不准、累坏马，夏锄雨勤定额没标准，秋收活杂包工容易不顾质量，造成损失，天旱时苗不齐没法包，天雨时草苗齐长没法包……。总之，一年四季包工计件都有困难。另外，社员对窝工浪费现象虽不满意，可是对包工的好处也了解不够，认为分队包工，你队多啦，我队少啦，反而不公平，不如这样干一天算一天好。有些体力弱劳动不够好的社员，更不乐意包，怕顶不下来。这些思想障碍没有解决，包工制也就很难推行了。
    其次，是区、乡工作人员对推行包工制的困难估计不足，具体帮助不够，不能经常注意解决包工中遇到的困难问题，常常“因噎废食”，遇到一些问题和阻碍就停下不包了。农业生产合作社的地块有远有近，有好有坏，劳力有强有弱，技术有高有低，加以农时气候复杂多变，在包工计件中对农活的安排和计算是会遇到很多问题的，如不能及时打破障碍，包工是很难贯彻和坚持的。如二区八郎村第四社耲高粮地时分两队包工，因为规定的包工标准有问题，一个队做的工作和另一队做的差不多，每人得的工分却相差一半；这个队的社员极为不满，说“包工包赔了”。问题发生后也没及时解决，就中断不包了。上台子村第一社算包工账算到半夜也没算清，社员不满地说：“多得几分不够耽误睡觉钱，不要包啦，对付着干吧！”就这样把包工中断了。旗、区工作人员对农业合作社实行包工制的经验不足，信心不高。如二区一个区委说：“包工制是区干部不会，村干部装懂。”全区十二名区委委员，只有区委书记懂得如何包工，其余有六人半会半不会，五人根本不摸门。他们因为自己不会，临到社遇到包工中的具体问题就很难帮助解决了。二区北上台村支部书记孙富民说：“光是喊叫包工，可是没帮助一个社做出样子来，结果六个社一个也没包好。”另外，旗、区工作人员包办代替，不注意总结传播经验，教社内骨干学会包工办法，往往是他们一走包工就停止了。有的合作社社员说：“干部来到包了工，干部走了一场空，社的骨干摸不着头脑发了蒙。”
    为了帮助农业生产合作社坚持实行短期包工制，郭前旗旗委准备首先从检查分析前一个时期实行包工的情况和问题入手，总结经验，接受教训，教育所有农村工作人员，认识实行包工对于领导集体生产的作用，克服某些工作人员的“怕麻烦”思想，并在检查和总结过程中，帮助区、乡工作人员学会办社，学会包工。其次，在推行包工制的过程中，要接受前一个时期的教训，转变只作一般号召不帮助解决具体问题的作法，要深入地经常地帮助一些农业合作社解决包工中遇到的问题，在这个基础上逐步积累经验，树立旗帜，使包工制能够由点到面地逐步推行，由临时到长期地逐步提高。
