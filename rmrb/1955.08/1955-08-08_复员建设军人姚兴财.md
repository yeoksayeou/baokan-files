In the Engineering Company of the Henan Textile Administration Bureau, demobilized construction soldier Yao Xingcai has been named a model and advanced worker four times.

Two and a half years ago, Yao Xingcai was a soldier in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, a third-class merit recipient. After being demobilized, he worked as a clerk, responsible for distributing office supplies and protective equipment for workers. These tasks, once considered small, ordinary, troublesome, and thankless, have been turned into extraordinary achievements by him.

At first, the work was very difficult. Yao Xingcai didn't even know the names of many things used by the engineering staff. He took time to ask the technicians and gradually became familiar with the names and uses of various tools. Then he wondered why so many things were issued each time. For example, locks are not easily broken, but new ones were frequently added, and some groups with only a few people would receive dozens of pencils. To understand the situation, he went to various units and found that some units had accumulated large quantities of office supplies, almost becoming "small warehouses." Many half-used pencils were left unused, and most locks were discarded simply because the keys were lost. Yao Xingcai seized on these examples, patiently explained, and calculated the costs, explaining that they should save every bit of wealth for the country that they could. Later, everyone paid attention to not over-ordering supplies and even brought waste locks to him to have keys made. Many comrades saw Yao Xingcai collecting empty ink bottles and glue bottles to sell without getting tired, and they voluntarily brought him bottles.

In May 1954, it was a tense construction phase of the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory. The concrete workers' rubber shoes wore out particularly quickly. Sending them to the city for repair was expensive and took a long time to get them back. Yao Xingcai bought a bottle of glue and tried to repair them himself during the lunch break. Under his influence, all the comrades in the administrative group actively participated in repairing rubber shoes, ensuring the needs of the project. Later, the leadership adopted Yao Xingcai's suggestion and found someone to specifically repair rubber shoes on the construction site, repairing them as soon as they were broken. This extended the service life of the rubber shoes, and more than 400 fewer pairs of new rubber shoes were issued in the second half of the year alone. He also suggested that workers wear gloves with worn palms inside out, and only replace them when both sides were worn.

When Yao Xingcai encountered something that he thought could be saved but couldn't solve himself, he discussed it with everyone. He saw piles of sawdust on the construction site and heard the materials team leader say that people in Hankou burned rice husks, so he thought: if rice husks can be burned, sawdust can also be burned. He consulted with Jia Wenkui from the boiler room and tried it on his tea stove. Who knew that the sawdust only produced a few puffs of black smoke and extinguished the original coal fire. He then asked Liu Fengxiang, who knew that the stove for burning rice husks was different from other stoves, but Liu Fengxiang himself didn't know how to build a stove for burning sawdust. Yao Xingcai inquired among the workers and found the bricklayer Wu Shuiqing, who successfully experimented with it. Using sawdust to boil water and steam buns was much faster than using coal. Using this method, more than 60,000 catties of coal have been saved from March to June this year. The company where Yao Xingcai is located is currently promoting this method universally.

    复员建设军人姚兴财

    在河南纺织管理局工程公司里，复员建设军人姚兴财已经四次被评为模范和先进工作者了。
    两年半以前，姚兴财是个中国人民志愿军战士，三等功臣。转业以后一直当事务员，负责领发办公用具和工人操作时用的防护用具。这些曾经被人认为细小、平凡、麻烦、不讨好的工作，他作出了不平凡的成绩。
    一开始工作是很困难的，工程人员用的许多东西，姚兴财连名字也叫不上来。他便抽空去问技术员，逐渐熟悉了各种用具的名称和用途。接着他考虑为什么每次都领发那么多东西，譬如锁并不是容易用坏的，但却经常添新的，有的组只几个人却要领几打铅笔。他为了弄明白情况，就到各单位去看看，发现有些单位积存了大批办公用具，快成“小仓库”了。许多半截铅笔放着不用，绝大多数锁只是因为钥匙掉了就作废了。姚兴财抓住这些实例，耐心地解释，算细账，说明能为国家节省一点财富，就该节省一点。以后大家都注意不多领用具，还把废锁找给他去配钥匙。许多同志看见姚兴财毫不厌烦地收集空墨水瓶和浆糊瓶去卖，就主动地把瓶子送给他。
    一九五四年五月，正是国营郑州第三棉纺织厂施工紧张的阶段。混凝土工人的胶鞋破得特别快，送进城去补费钱多，还不能很快地拿回来。姚兴财就买瓶胶水，抽中午休息时间自己试着补；行政组的全体同志在他的影响下都积极参加补胶鞋，保证了工程的需要。以后，领导上采纳了姚兴财的建议，找个人专门到工地上补胶鞋，随破随补，这样就能延长胶鞋的使用期，仅下半年就少发四百多双新胶鞋。他还建议工人们把手掌磨破了的手套反过来戴，等两面都破了才换新的。
    姚兴财遇到自己认为可以节约但自己不能解决的事，就找大家商量。他看见工地上有堆积成山的锯末，又听材料组长说过汉口有人烧稻糠，就想：稻糠能烧锯末也能烧。他找开水房的贾文魁商量，到他的茶炉上试一试，谁知道锯末倒上去只冒了几股黑烟，把原来的煤火也弄灭了。他又找刘凤翔问，才知道烧稻糠的灶和别的灶不一样，但刘凤翔自己不会砌烧锯末的灶。姚兴财就到工人中去打听，找到泥工吴水清才试验成功，用锯末烧开水、蒸馍比煤火还快得多。运用这个方法，从今年三月到六月已节约煤六万多斤。目前姚兴财所在的公司正在普遍推广这个方法。
