Xinhua News Agency, August 30th. The Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions was held to discuss the tasks of Chinese trade unions in realizing the First Five-Year Plan and several issues in trade union construction arising therefrom.

　　Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a report at the meeting entitled "Strengthen Trade Union Construction, Closely Link Trade Unions with the Masses, and Strive to Successfully Complete the Nation's First Five-Year Plan." All the committee members present had a full discussion of Lai Ruoyu's report.

　　The plenary session believes that the work of trade union organizations, since the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions in 1953, has been, and should continue to be, dedicated to completing the nation's First Five-Year Plan and building China into a great socialist country. This is the fundamental goal of all trade union work. All levels of trade union organizations across the country must extensively and deeply publicize the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the People's Republic of China to all workers and their families, greatly enhance the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of workers, greatly consolidate labor discipline, and fully utilize their labor enthusiasm and creativity to carry out conscious and selfless labor for the complete and over-fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan.

　　The plenary session pointed out that the basic method for the Chinese working class to realize the First Five-Year Plan is to widely carry out labor emulation campaigns. In recent years, trade unions have made progress in organizing labor emulation campaigns. In particular, in 1954, labor emulation campaigns were not only universally launched nationwide but also gradually became regularized, and some useful experiences began to be accumulated. However, the formalism phenomenon in the current labor emulation campaigns is widespread and serious, and has become the main obstacle to pushing the labor emulation campaigns to a new upsurge. This formalism phenomenon is inseparable from the bureaucracy in the leadership style of the trade unions. In order to overcome formalism, in addition to vigorously carrying out propaganda and education on the First Five-Year Plan to the workers, it is particularly necessary to strengthen the specific organizational work of the labor emulation campaigns, take concrete measures to help workers solve problems in production, and help them realize the conditions guaranteed by the competition and achieve various indicators. In the labor emulation campaigns, trade unions should pay special attention to implementing the policy of improving technology, innovating technology, and learning and mastering new technologies, realistically organize the masses to learn from Soviet advanced technology, and promote Soviet and Chinese advanced experiences. At the same time, the role of engineering and technical personnel and staff must be further brought into play. Trade union organizations should pay close attention to the wage and reward work of workers.

　　The plenary session emphasized that, in order to ensure the realization of the First Five-Year Plan, the supervisory role of trade union organizations, that is, the self-initiated, bottom-up supervisory role of the masses, must be brought into play, and the fight against all phenomena of corruption and waste, violation of laws and regulations, and bureaucracy that violate the interests of the state and the working class must be waged. The supervision of trade union organizations can only be fully effective under the leadership of the Party. At the same time, all the work of trade unions must also be placed under the supervision of the masses. Trade union organizations should put forward suggestions for improvement in the work of enterprises at any time.

　　The plenary session believes that, in order to ensure the realization of the task of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan, trade unions must educate and mobilize workers in private enterprises to resolutely support the government's policy of implementing socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Trade union organizations should strengthen the supervision of capitalist enterprises.

　　The meeting also reviewed and approved the report of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on strengthening the work of handicraft trade unions, pointing out that trade unions also bear significant responsibility in the socialist transformation of handicrafts.

　　The plenary session, in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, focused on examining several issues in the leadership style of trade unions. The examination showed that the basic problem existing in the current work of trade unions, which is also the biggest problem hindering the continued progress of trade union work, is the bureaucracy in the leadership style of the trade unions. The plenary session emphasized that improving the leadership style of trade unions is a central link in improving the entire work of trade unions at present. In this regard, the meeting believes that all trade union workers must be constantly reminded: trade union organizations must always care about the lives of the masses and help the masses solve those difficulties that can be solved; at the same time, all the work of trade unions must adopt the methods of attraction and guidance, and all the activities of trade union organizations must be established on the basis of the conscious and voluntary participation of the masses, fully promote democracy, and place all the work under the supervision of the masses. Leading organs at all levels of trade unions must take concrete measures to strengthen the work of industrial trade unions, and in grass-roots trade union organizations, in particular, the work of groups should be strengthened, and broad activists should be attracted and relied upon to participate in various activities of the trade unions. Grass-roots trade union cadres should all understand and learn the basic working methods of trade unions, namely, the methods of persuasion and education, and the methods of attraction and guidance.

　　The plenary session believes that the biggest weakness of the Chinese working class at present is the backwardness of cultural and technical levels, which is one of the biggest difficulties in our country during the construction period. Therefore, in addition to implementing the policy of improving technology, innovating technology, and learning and mastering new technologies in labor emulation campaigns, it is also necessary to systematically improve the cultural and technical levels of the broad masses of workers in the future, and effectively strengthen the leadership of cultural and technical education for the broad masses of workers.

　　The plenary session unanimously endorsed the decision of the Seventh Presidium Meeting of the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to revoke Rao Shushi's qualification as a member of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and expel him from trade union membership, and pointed out that trade union organizations must always pay attention to and strengthen the political and ideological education of the broad masses of workers, constantly improve the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of workers, and at the same time, must educate all workers to constantly improve their political vigilance and strictly guard against the conspiracies and sabotage of all counter-revolutionary elements. The meeting called for carrying out the current struggle to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements to the end, in order to safeguard the smooth progress of our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation.

　　Finally, Lai Ruoyu made a concluding report at the plenary session. All the committee members present unanimously adopted the report made by Lai Ruoyu, "Strengthen Trade Union Construction, Closely Link Trade Unions with the Masses, and Strive to Successfully Complete the Nation's First Five-Year Plan," and unanimously adopted documents such as the "Letter to All Workers from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on Ensuring the Completion and Over-fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" and the "Decision of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on Strengthening the Work of Activists."

　　According to the proposal of the Presidium of the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the plenary session unanimously adopted the supplementary election of Zhang Xiuzhu as a member of the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

　　This meeting was held in Beijing from August 5th to 10th. Fifty-two formal executive committee members and fifteen alternate executive committee members attended this plenary session. The heads of various departments of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the heads of various industrial trade unions and trade union federations of provinces and cities attended the meeting as non-voting delegates.

　　中华全国总工会执行委员会举行全体会议
　　讨论五年计划期间工会的任务
　　通过告全国职工书和关于加强积极分子工作的决定
    新华社三十日讯　中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会举行第三次全体会议，讨论中国工会在实现第一个五年计划中的任务以及由此而产生的工会建设中的若干问题。
    中华全国总工会主席赖若愚在会议上作了题为
  “加强工会建设，密切工会与群众的联系，为胜利地完成国家的第一个五年计划而奋斗”的报告。全体到会委员对赖若愚的报告进行了充分的讨论。
    全体会议认为，工会组织的工作，从一九五三年中国工会第七次全国代表大会以来就一直是、而且在今后更应该是为完成国家的第一个五年计划而努力，为把中国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而努力。这是工会一切工作的根本目标。全国工会各级组织都必须广泛深入地向全体职工及其家属宣传中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，大大地提高全体职工群众的社会主义觉悟，大大地巩固劳动纪律，并充分地发挥他们的劳动积极性和创造精神，为第一个五年计划的全部完成和超额完成而进行自觉的忘我的劳动。
    全体会议指出，我国工人阶级实现第一个五年计划的基本方法，就是广泛地开展劳动竞赛。几年以来，工会在组织劳动竞赛方面是有进步的，特别是一九五四年，劳动竞赛不但在全国范围内普遍地开展起来了，并且逐步地走向经常化，开始积累了一些有益的经验。但是，目前劳动竞赛中的形式主义现象普遍而严重，已成为当前把劳动竞赛推向新的高涨的主要障碍。这种形式主义的现象，是同工会领导作风上的官僚主义分不开的。为要克服形式主义，除了要向职工群众大力进行第一个五年计划的宣传教育以外，特别要加强劳动竞赛的具体组织工作，采取具体的措施帮助工人解决生产中的问题，帮助他们实现竞赛保证条件和达到各项指标。工会在劳动竞赛中应当特别注意贯彻提高技术、改进技术、学习和掌握新技术的方针，实事求是地组织群众学习苏联先进技术，推广苏联的和中国的先进经验。同时，必须更大地发挥工程技术人员和职员的作用。工会组织应当十分重视职工的工资和奖励工作。
    全体会议强调指出，为了保证实现第一个五年计划，必须发挥工会组织的监督作用，即群众的自下而上的监督作用，向一切违反国家利益和工人阶级利益的贪污浪费、违法乱纪、官僚主义等现象进行斗争。工会组织的监督必须在党的领导下才能充分发挥作用。同时，工会的一切工作也必须放在群众的监督之下。工会组织应当随时对企业中的工作提出改进意见。
    全体会议认为，为了保证第一个五年计划有关资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的任务的实现，工会必须教育和动员私营企业中的职工坚决支持政府对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造的政策。工会组织应该加强对资本主义企业的监督工作。
    会议同时审查和批准了中华全国总工会关于加强手工业工会工作的报告，指出工会在对于手工业的社会主义改造当中，也担负着重大的责任。
    全体会议以批评和自我批评的精神，着重检查了工会领导作风上的若干问题。检查中表明，当前工会工作中存在的基本问题，也就是阻碍工会工作继续进步的最大问题，就是工会的领导作风上的官僚主义。全体会议强调指出，改进工会的领导作风是当前改进整个工会工作的一个中心环节。在这方面，会议认为必须时刻提醒所有的工会工作者：工会组织必须时刻关心群众的生活，帮助群众解决那些能够解决的困难；同时，工会的一切工作必须采取吸引和诱导的方法，工会组织的一切活动必须建立在群众自觉自愿的基础上，充分地发扬民主，把全部工作放在群众的监督之下。工会各级领导机关必须采取具体措施加强产业工会的工作，在工会基层组织中，特别应当加强小组工作，吸引和依靠广大的积极分子参加工会的各项活动。工会基层工作干部都应当懂得并学会工会的基本的工作方法，即说服教育的方法，吸引和诱导的方法。
    全体会议认为，目前我国工人阶级最大的弱点是文化技术水平落后，这是我国在建设时期的最大困难之一。因此，除了在劳动竞赛中要贯彻提高技术、改进技术、学习和掌握新技术的方针以外，今后还必须系统地提高职工群众的文化水平和技术水平，并切实加强对职工群众的文化和技术教育的领导。
    全体会议一致拥护中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会主席团第七次会议关于撤销饶漱石的中华全国总工会执行委员的资格和开除其工会会籍的决定，并指出：工会组织必须经常地重视和加强对职工群众的政治思想教育，不断地提高职工群众的社会主义觉悟，同时，必须教育全体职工时刻提高政治警惕性，严防一切反革命分子的阴谋破坏。会议号召把目前肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子的斗争进行到底，以保卫我国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利进行。
    全体会议最后由赖若愚作了总结报告。全体到会委员一致通过了赖若愚所作的“加强工会建设，密切工会与群众的联系，为胜利地完成国家的第一个五年计划而奋斗”的报告，并一致通过了“中华全国总工会为保证完成和超额完成发展国民经济的第一个五年计划告全国职工书”和“中华全国总工会关于加强积极分子工作的决定”等文件。
    根据中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会主席团的提议，全体会议一致通过补选张修竹为中华全国总工会主席团委员和中华全国总工会书记处书记。
    这次会议是在八月五日到十日在北京举行的。出席这次全体会议的有正式执行委员五十二人，候补执行委员十五人。中华全国总工会各部门的负责人和各产业工会、各省市工会联合会的负责人都列席了这次会议。
