Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 6th (TASS dispatch): The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union passed a resolution on the report made by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, on the results of the Geneva Four-Power Summit.

The resolution stated that the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union fully endorsed the work of the Soviet government delegation at the Geneva Conference. The policy of peace and diplomacy consistently pursued by the Soviet government delegation at the Geneva Conference is in line with the vital interests of the Soviet people and the interests of consolidating world peace and security.

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union believes that international tensions have eased somewhat recently due to the effective work of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries. This, coupled with the powerful influence of the people's peace movement on government foreign policy, has created a favorable atmosphere for the Geneva Conference.

The resolution stated that the Geneva Four-Power Conference played a significant role in further easing tensions between countries, especially between the four major powers participating in the meeting. This meeting is of historical significance and marks the beginning of a new stage in improving relations between countries with different political and social systems on the basis of peaceful coexistence and the establishment of trust between countries.

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union noted with satisfaction that the main feature of the Geneva Conference was the spirit of cooperation and mutual understanding necessary for building international trust. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union expressed the hope that the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference to be held in October this year will follow the instructions of the heads of government of the four countries and continue to move forward on the road to resolving outstanding international issues.

The resolution stated that the personal contacts established by the heads of government of the four countries at the Geneva Conference will promote the establishment of an atmosphere of cooperation in international affairs. At the same time, the establishment of direct links between the parliaments of various countries and the exchange of parliamentary delegations at the initiative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union are also positive factors in easing international tensions, and it is hoped that such contacts will be expanded.

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union expressed its belief that the establishment of broader political, economic, and cultural relations between countries with different social and political systems, on the basis of respect for sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs, is in the interests of the people of all countries and will promote the consolidation of peace, friendship, and cooperation between countries.

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union believes that the Geneva Conference and the instructions given to the foreign ministers by the heads of government of the four countries are a new inspiration for the people of all countries, and will prompt them to further strengthen the struggle for the consolidation of world peace. The peace-loving people of all countries will undoubtedly show due vigilance and necessary determination so that the tasks put forward by the heads of government of the four countries in Geneva can become concrete decisions promoting universal peace and the security of the people of all countries.

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union declares: The Soviet Union has pursued and will continue to pursue a policy of peace, international cooperation, and easing international tensions, and will continue to strive to build trust between countries in order to peacefully resolve the most important international issues through consultation. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union hopes to gain the support of parliaments and governments of all countries in this regard.
