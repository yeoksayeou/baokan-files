Every Collective Mess Unit Must Conserve Grain

	How Renmin University of China Conserves Grain
	Zhang Chongshan
	Since Beijing launched the grain conservation campaign in March, Renmin University of China has conducted several inspections of the university's grain consumption. The inspections revealed grain wastage in three areas: eating, cooking, and management. There were many instances of wasting grain during meals. For example, some people casually took steamed buns to their dormitories, and the leftovers were stuffed into drawers, where they would become moldy and deteriorate over time. In some dormitories, six or seven steamed buns were found in drawers at one time. Some people scattered food and dishes everywhere while eating. Some piled up large portions of their favorite dishes, only to waste the leftovers. Some ate the filling of stuffed foods but threw away the crust. Some took a bite of food they didn't like and casually threw it away. Therefore, before the start of the grain conservation campaign, leftover rice and steamed buns were often found in dormitories, dining halls, dirty water buckets, and seepage ditches.

	Grain wastage during cooking manifested itself in: a lack of care when washing rice, causing rice grains to be flushed down the drain; discarded flour scattered on the kneading board; leftover food often fermenting and spoiling due to improper storage, making it inedible; and occasionally, due to the cooks' technical shortcomings, steamed sponge cakes turning sour, rice containing sand, etc. These also caused considerable waste.

	In terms of mess hall management, the main problem was inaccurate headcount, leading to over- or under-cooking. There was also considerable waste in warehouse management. For example, some units stored cornmeal and wheat flour in warehouses for extended periods without ventilation or restacking, causing some of the flour to become moldy and deteriorate. In some warehouses, rats tunneled under and stole entire bags of rice. These phenomena occurred in all units.

	To eliminate grain wastage, the university launched a campaign of publicity and education on grain conservation under the leadership of the Party organization and administration.

	Each mess unit used blackboards to criticize instances of grain wastage. Some blackboards featured vivid and interesting cartoons, while others used poetry, clapper talk, and other forms to promote anti-wastage, which had a great educational effect on the masses.

	The twenty-seven small-scale anti-waste exhibitions held by various units played a significant role in mobilizing everyone to conserve grain. These exhibitions focused on actual examples of grain wastage in each unit. For example, one mess hall serving 600 people collected the noodles that had fallen on the tables after a meal, and it was enough to make a pound of dry noodles. If noodles were eaten once a week, the entire month would waste four pounds of flour, and the entire year would waste forty-eight pounds of flour. This fact made the masses realize: "A trickle can become a river"; small waste is the beginning of big waste, inconspicuous and scattered waste, when accumulated, becomes alarming waste. This type of exhibition, with concrete facts and analysis, had a great educational effect on the masses. People who had engaged in wasteful behavior felt remorse after seeing the exhibits, feeling that they had let down the working people, and were therefore determined to overcome waste.

	After raising everyone's awareness, they consciously fought against waste. Some people secretly dumped leftover food, and when discovered, were severely criticized by everyone. Everyone also forcefully refuted arguments used to justify wasting grain, such as "I bought the food with my own money, so it's none of your business whether I waste it or not," and "Wasting grain is a minor matter of life, don't nitpick," etc.

	The phenomenon of wasting grain during meals has been reduced, but the shortcomings in mess hall management have not been completely corrected. Various mess units still show blindness in purchasing grain, and some managers even consciously make false reports and claims, being generous with their use. In July, the school focused on the key link of verifying grain consumption. In June, two vice-presidents emphasized the issue of grain conservation in their reports at the meetings of staff and students, mobilizing for comprehensive conservation. Starting in July, school leaders carefully reviewed the grain consumption plans of each unit. Renmin University's grain consumers can be divided into two categories: one is collective household registration, personnel who join the mess collectively, about 9,000 people; the other is dispersed household registration, personnel who eat on their own, about 1,000 people. Therefore, the work of verifying grain consumption is also carried out in two aspects.

	When formulating grain consumption plans for collective households, the first step is to educate management personnel about the importance of verifying the plan, requiring them to treat this work with a correct attitude; the second step is to verify the number of people eating in each unit. In the past, due to lax grain purchase system, the number of people eating in each mess was unclear, and anyone could eat as long as they paid, regardless of whether they had formal household registration. The verification of the supply system requires calculation based on formal household registration, so it is necessary to investigate household registration, verify the basic number of people eating, and propose a correct grain consumption plan. After the number of people is verified, the daily grain consumption per person is calculated. The July grain consumption plans for each mess were successively reviewed by the mess hall section, the administrative affairs department, and finally by the vice-president. During the layers of review, the grain consumption plans of fourteen mess halls were found to be inappropriate. For example, some mess halls had excessively high monthly grain consumption plans, lacking the spirit of starting from small things and making careful calculations to save. Some mess halls had accumulated enough grain in stock for a month, but still planned to purchase another month's worth of grain when making their grain purchase plan. During the review, this behavior of purchasing excessive state grain was resolutely stopped. After careful study and precise calculations, the average grain consumption per person in the entire school in July was 29.18 jin, a decrease of 1.43 jin compared to the average consumption per person in June. The entire school reduced grain purchases by more than 13,170 jin in one month. The school leadership plans to strengthen control over the grain consumption plans of various types of canteens in the future, which may further reduce the total grain consumption of the school.

	The school provided great assistance in formulating grain consumption plans for dispersed households. The school organized a working group to cooperate with the people's committees of various districts to go to the homes of faculty and staff scattered throughout the city to carry out publicity and mobilization for their families. With the help of the school's working group, each household formulated a grain consumption plan. Families whose plans were too high automatically lowered them after explanation and persuasion. In this way, most families were able to submit their grain consumption plans on time and relatively realistically, and these plans were quickly approved by the government.

	In terms of mess hall management, Renmin University's practices are: cooking food according to the actual number of people at each meal; assigning fixed seats to diners to facilitate headcount; arranging separate tables for people who need to withdraw from the mess halfway through, so that they are no longer prepared food when they withdraw; and requiring transient personnel to pay with grain coupons to eat, and refusing to provide meals without grain coupons. Management personnel pay attention to the laws of eating, for example, fewer dishes should be prepared when many people go home for holidays or go out; no dishes are prepared when eating stuffed staples; and no savory side dishes are prepared when eating sweet staples. In addition, the conditions of climate and season are also taken into account. According to the general rules, the amount of food is increased when the appetite increases in spring and autumn, and the amount of food is reduced when the appetite decreases in summer. Mastering these rules also avoids a lot of waste.

	Based on the existing experience of the cooks, grain can also be saved in the following aspects. When pouring out rice washing water, place a wire sieve to prevent rice from being washed away. In the past, the rice grains in rice buckets and rice troughs were washed away after brushing, but now they are all brushed down with clean water and eaten next time. When steaming steamed buns or sponge cakes, there is a lot of leftover food stuck on the屉布of the steamer. In the past, it was washed and discarded, but now the cooks brush it down with clean water and eat it with the dough. Shake clean rice bags, sweep clean flour bags. Each empty flour bag can be swept down at least half an ounce of flour. The school consumes about 30,340 bags of flour throughout the year, and sweeping flour bags alone can save more than 940 jin of flour. Educate diners not to take too much rice, and not to fill the container beyond its capacity. When steaming steamed buns or sponge cakes, make them in different sizes for the convenience of the masses to eat according to their quantity. This can reduce leftover food to a minimum. The school requires each mess to keep leftover food below 1% of the actual amount of grain used, and to preserve it well to prevent deterioration, so that it can be eaten at the next meal.

	In terms of warehouse management, each mess is required not to hoard grain, and the grain stored in the warehouse must be ventilated and restacked frequently, eating the old and storing the new, to avoid damage.

	In order to implement the spirit of grain conservation, each unit has established an inspection system, requiring leaders to go to each mess to supervise and inspect frequently, and to organize mutual inspections, mutual supervision, and mutual learning among the mess halls.

### 中国人民大学是怎样节约粮食的

专栏：每个集体伙食单位都要节约粮食

    中国人民大学是怎样节约粮食的
    张崇山
    自从三月间北京市开展节约粮食运动以来，中国人民大学曾对全校用粮情况进行了多次检查。在检查中发现在吃饭、做饭、管理三个方面，都有浪费粮食的现象。吃饭浪费粮食的现象很多。例如有些人随便往宿舍里带馒头，吃剩的馒头塞在抽屉里，日久即发霉变质。有的宿舍在抽屉里一次就捡到六、七个馒头。有的人吃饭时到处抛撒饭菜。有的人每遇到自己喜欢吃的饭食占了一大堆，吃剩后就糟蹋了。有的人吃带馅的食物，只吃馅，扔掉皮。有的人对不可口的食物咬一口就随便扔掉。所以，在节约粮食运动开始前，宿舍、饭厅、脏水桶、渗沟内时常发现有许多剩饭、剩馒头等。
    做饭浪费粮食的现象表现在：淘米时不爱惜粮食，致使大米被冲入下水道内；面案上撒的面都丢掉了；剩下的饭菜常常因保管不善而发酵变质，不能食用；有时因为炊事员技术上有缺点，把丝糕蒸酸了，米饭里有沙子，等等。这些也造成了不少浪费。
    在伙食管理方面，主要是掌握人数不太精确，做饭时只是一般的估计，因而饭做得非多即少。在仓库管理方面也有不少的浪费，如有的单位在仓库里存放的玉米面和小麦面长久未通风倒垛，致使部分面粉发霉变质。有的仓库里存的整包大米被老鼠盗入地下。这些现象各个单位都有。
    为了消除浪费粮食现象，在学校党组织和行政方面的领导下，全校展开了节约粮食的宣传教育工作。
    各伙食单位通过黑板报，对浪费粮食的现象进行了批评。有的黑板报上画了好多生动有趣的讽刺画，有的黑板报用诗歌、快板等形式，宣传反对浪费粮食，对群众起了很大教育作用。
    各单位举办的二十七个小型反浪费展览会，在动员大家节约粮食的斗争中起了很大的作用。这些展览都是以各单位浪费粮食的实际事例为中心内容的。例如，有一个六百人的中灶，吃过一顿面条后，把掉在桌子上的面条收集起来，就够一斤干面做成的那么多面条。如果每周吃面条一次，全月就要浪费面粉四斤，全年就要浪费面粉四十八斤。这个事实使群众认识到：“涓涓之水，可以成河”；小浪费是大浪费的开端，不显著的分散的浪费，集中起来就成了惊人的浪费。这种展览由于有具体事实，又有分析说明，对群众教育作用很大。有浪费行为的人看到展览品后感到痛心，觉得自己对不起劳动人民，因而决心克服浪费。
    大家的觉悟提高以后，便自觉地向浪费现象进行斗争。有的人把吃剩的饭偷偷地倒掉，在被发觉后，就受到了大家严厉的批评。大家对一些为浪费粮食找借口的说法，如“我花自己的钱买来的饭，浪费不浪费同你何干”，“浪费粮食是生活小节，不要吹毛求疵”，等等，也都给了有力的批驳。
    吃饭方面浪费粮食的现象是减少了；但伙食管理工作中的缺点，还没有完全纠正。各伙食单位在购买粮食时还有盲目性，个别的管理人员甚至有意识地虚报冒领，宽打宽用。七月份，学校便抓紧了核实粮食用量这个主要环节。六月间，两位副校长在工作人员和学生的大会上所作的动员全面节约的报告中都曾强调了节约粮食的问题。从七月开始，学校领导人员对各单位用粮食计划都认真地进行审查。人民大学用粮人员可分为两类：一类为集体户口，集体入伙的人员，约有九千多人；一类为分散户口，分散起伙的人员，约有一千多人。因此核实用粮的工作也是分两方面进行的。
    在制定集体户口用粮计划时，首先教育管理人员认识核实计划的重要性，要求他们用正确的态度来对待这件工作；其次是核实各单位入伙人数。过去由于购粮制度不严，各个灶的入伙人数稽查不清，不管有无正式户口，交钱即可吃饭。核实供应制度要求按正式户口计算，因此必须清查户口，核实基本入伙人数，提出正确的用粮计划。人数查清以后，就核算每人每日用粮量。各灶的七月份用粮计划，在校内挨次经过了伙食科、行政事务部的审核，最后又经副校长审查。在层层审查中，发现十四个灶定的用粮计划不恰当。如有的灶全月用粮计划偏高，缺乏从小处着手、精打细算的节约精神。有的灶已往累积下来的存粮已够一个月的食用，但做购粮计划时仍要再购买一个月的用粮。在审查中，坚决制止了这种多购国家粮食的行为。经过仔细研究和精打细算，七月份全校每人平均用粮量为二九·一八斤，比六月份平均每人用量降低了一·四三斤，全校一个月就降低购粮量一万三千一百七十多斤。学校领导方面今后还准备对各种类型的食堂的用粮计划加强控制，这样还有可能进一步降低全校用粮数量。
    对分散户口制定用粮计划的工作，学校给予了很大的帮助。学校曾组织了一个工作组，配合各区人民委员会，深入到分散在城内的教职员工的家里，对他们的家属进行了宣传动员。在学校工作组的帮助下，每户都制定了用粮计划，计划定得偏高的家庭，经过解释说服后，也自动降低了。这样，大部分家属都能按时而且比较切合实际地提出自己的用粮计划，这些计划都很快得到了政府的批准。
    在伙食管理方面，人民大学的做法是：每餐按实有人数做饭菜；吃饭人员固定座位，以便于稽核人数；对中途需要退伙的人员单独编桌，到退伙时即不再给准备饭；流动人员交粮票吃饭，不交粮票不予开饭。管理人员注意掌握用饭的规律，例如假日回家或外出的人员多，应少做菜饭；吃带馅的主食，就不备菜；吃甜的主食，则不做咸味的副食。此外，也考虑到气候和季节的条件，按照一般人的规律，春秋季节食量上升就多做些饭，夏天食量下降就少做些饭。掌握了这些规律，也就避免了许多浪费。
    根据炊事员已有的经验，还可以从下列几方面来节约粮食。倒淘米水时，放一铁丝罗，防止冲走大米。饭桶、饭槽内的饭粒，过去刷后就倒掉了，现在一律用清水刷下，下次食用。蒸馒头或丝糕时，在蒸笼的屉布上黏有好多剩余食物，过去洗后倒掉，现在炊事员都将它用清水刷下，合在发面内吃掉。抖净米袋，扫清面袋。每个空面袋至少可扫下半两面粉，全校全年约吃面粉三万零三百四十多袋，仅扫面袋，即可节约面粉九百四十多斤。教育吃饭的人不要多占饭，盛饭不超过容器。蒸馒头或丝糕时，个头有大有小，便于群众随量食用。这样就可以把剩饭降低到最低限度。学校要求各灶剩饭不超过实用粮数的百分之一，而且要很好保存，不使变质，以便下顿继续食用。
    在仓库管理方面，要求各灶不积压粮食，库中存粮要经常通风倒垛，吃旧存新，以免损坏。
    为贯彻节约粮食的精神，各单位建立了检查制度，要求领导人员经常到各灶督促检查，并组织各灶之间的互相检查，互相督促，互相学习。
