Shandong Province's state-owned commercial departments are taking active measures to strengthen the supply of materials to rural areas in coordination with the summer procurement work. The preliminary material supply plan formulated by the province's state-owned commercial departments shows that the commodity supply will increase by more than 14% compared to the same period in 1954. Purchasing and supplying units in various cities have strengthened and improved material transfer work, resolutely implementing the principle of giving priority to supplying the daily-use industrial products needed by rural areas to rural areas. The proportion of the inventory of five purchasing and supplying stations, including Qingdao, Jinan, and Yantai, at the end of June accounted for the proportion of the province’s total inventory, which has been reduced from 35.68% in May to 32.8%, a decrease of 14.2% compared with the same period in 1954.

Under the unified leadership of the Financial and Economic Committee, state-owned commercial departments in various regions held material supply meetings with supply and marketing cooperatives to connect the plans of both parties and sign supply contracts. For example, the Weixian Branch of the China National Department Store Shandong Provincial Company signed supply contracts with the supply and marketing cooperatives of each county in the Changwei Special District in late June, totaling 2.89 million yuan. The Jinan Branch of the China National Department Store Shandong Provincial Company held an "Industrial Products Tour Exhibition Supply Meeting," and sold more than 20,000 yuan worth of goods in the fifth district of Yutai County alone, of which the value of goods supplied to grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives was more than 18,000 yuan, and the value of goods supplied to vendors was more than 2,000 yuan. In addition, state-owned commercial departments in various regions, together with supply and marketing cooperatives, and with the participation of private merchants, held some small-scale material exchange meetings in markets, grain purchase points, and temple fairs, supplying a large number of industrial products to farmers.

    山东各地国营商业部门配合夏季收购加强物资供应
    山东省各地国营商业部门采取积极措施，配合夏季收购工作加强农村的物资供应。全省国营商业部门已经初步制定的物资供应计划，商品供应量比一九五四年同时期增加百分之十四以上。各城市采购供应单位加强和改进了物资调运工作，坚决贯彻了为农村需要的日用工业品优先供应农村的原则。青岛、济南、烟台等五个采购供应站六月底库存量占全省库存量的比重，已由五月份的百分之三十五点六八压缩为百分之三十二点八，比一九五四年同时期库存量减少百分之十四点二。
    各地国营商业部门在财委的统一领导下同供销合作社举行了物资供应会议，衔接双方计划，签订供应合同。如中国百货公司山东省公司潍县分公司在六月下旬同昌潍专区各县供销合作社签订了第三季度供应合同共二百八十九万元。中国百货公司山东省公司济宁分公司举行“工业品巡回展览供应会”，仅在鱼台县第五区便销售了二万多元的货物，其中供应基层供销合作社的商品值一万八千多元，供应商贩的商品值二千多元。此外，各地国营商业部门还同供销合作社一起，并组织私商参加，利用集市、购粮点、庙会等场合，召开了一些小型物资交流会，供应给农民大量工业品。
