Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 16th: The People's Liberation Army coastal defense forces on the Fujian Front have successively repulsed two groups of Chiang Kai-shek bandits attempting to land and harass areas such as Chongwu and Weitou in Fujian Province.

At 2:00 AM on the 16th, a group of eleven armed bandits from the search team of the Chiang Kai-shek Eighth Army, entrenched on Jinmen Island, attempted to land near Chongwu, Fujian Province, under the cover of two Chiang Kai-shek warships. The People's Liberation Army coastal defense forces, upon discovering them, immediately launched a head-on attack, killing one Chiang Kai-shek soldier, capturing two Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, and seizing a batch of walkie-talkies, guns, and ammunition. The remaining Chiang Kai-shek soldiers fled back to the sea in a panic.

At 23:10 on the 11th, forty armed bandits from the amphibious operations training team of the Chiang Kai-shek Eighth Army, under the cover of two Chiang Kai-shek gunboats, landed on the northeast coast of Weitou, Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, aboard two motorized sailboats and one wooden boat, attempting to harass the area. As soon as the advance troops of this Chiang Kai-shek force climbed onto the mainland, they were immediately met with a fierce attack from the People's Liberation Army coastal defense forces. The Chiang Kai-shek soldiers fled into the sea in a state of confusion. Our army killed one Chiang Kai-shek officer, captured two Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, and seized one pistol, one carbine, and one signal gun.
