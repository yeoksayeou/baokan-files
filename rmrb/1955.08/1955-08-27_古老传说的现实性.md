　　The Reality of Ancient Legends
　　By A. Morozov, Soviet Writer, Stalin Prize Winner

    My concept of Chinese dramatic art was, for a long time, limited to the scope of ancient traditional Chinese drama. Moreover, these concepts were mainly derived from lectures or museums. The performance of the Yue Opera Troupe of the People's Republic of China will be unforgettable to me, not only for the joy of my first encounter with the art circles of our friendly New China but also for the extreme excitement caused by the genuine artistic feelings of everything seen and heard. The performance of the drama reached great and extraordinary skill, making it easy to understand, while the artistic language was unique and expressive.

    The entire Yue Opera Troupe presented us with a new world of ancient Chinese poems—poems of noble emotions, thoughts, and aspirations. The people have always dreamed of a beautiful, noble, and free life, and they have woven their dreams into songs and stories. Beautiful songs and stories call people to move forward and arouse anger against social injustice, evil, and oppression. The poems of the true people always resonate in the hearts of people of all countries who are walking on different paths of historical development.

    It is precisely for this reason that the opera "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai," created on the basis of folk tales, fascinates and moves Soviet audiences.

    The height of the truth of the facts condensed in the unique form of folk art touches us vividly and directly. This long-tempered method of expression, which is unfamiliar to us, not only does not hinder our understanding because of its strangeness but also strengthens the effect of aesthetic impressions. This has nothing in common with "foreign sentiment" or with appreciating unfamiliar art.

    The achievements of artistic regularity revealed and created by another nation show us the unique national and historical characteristics of this nation. Historical reality is inexhaustible, and the forms of its practical reflection are also very rich. Therefore, retaining national characteristics and inheriting ancient artistic traditions, sometimes from the past, are indispensable conditions for true, highly realistic art. It is not a colorless imitation of reality but an expression of it in true, poetic images. The actors of the Yue Opera Troupe are creating this image!

    Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai are the embodiment of the people's bright hope. They broke through the social environment that limited them. The love of knowledge, the respect for books and education, all emphasize the noble humanism of their thoughts and wishes, making them prophets of new ideas for the complete liberation of mankind.

    The story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai is not simply a story of two lovers, nor is it just a poem about love and faithfulness. This couple is a person with great vitality. However, the manifestation of this vitality lies not only in affirming the right to individual freedom and personal happiness, which, of course, is a bold challenge to the feudal social structure. The protagonists of the opera, filled with noble emotions and pain, call for a better future and foreshadow this future. Therefore, their death itself is a triumph and victory, a source of optimism and confidence in a happy future. They enlighten our wisdom and hearts.

    The actress Fan Ruijuan created an excellent image of Liang Shanbo, a gentle, idealistic young man, who is upright and brave, intelligent and naive, and sincere to both people and himself. In the beautiful wit of Zhu Yingtai (played by the actress Fu Quanxiang), there is the tenderness of the first confession of love, and she tries her best to reveal her secret to Liang Shanbo with hints and puns.

    The entire fourth scene, which describes the journey, is full of extraordinary lyrical magic. To embody the eighteen-mile journey on a small stage can be regarded as a high achievement of true dramatic realism. Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai walk in front of the static stage scenery, but the audience really feels that the scenery is changing all the time, that mountains and steep slopes appear on the way they pass, and that the road is winding along the green hills. Then, in front of us, there is a rickety small arch bridge over a gurgling small river. The young man and girl obviously walked across this bridge. Next to the small bridge, Zhu Yingtai told the fable of the annual meeting of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl on the magpie bridge.

    The truth of emotions and acting is always more convincing than any stage props. If a stage set of a small bridge and a small river appeared on the stage, would it add anything to this truth? No matter what artistic style this small bridge is built in, and no matter how light and graceful it is in itself, it may not add anything to the artistic truth of the image. We know that so-called true realism is not simply imitating what is directly seen in life but is to excavate the true and profound content of the entire reality, including the ideological and moral evaluation of reality.

    The poetic legend about Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai reveals to us the unusually true historical reality in the social relations of old China, which was formed on a specific historical basis. The actors of the Yue Opera Troupe extracted the purest and most humane things that could be produced in that era and embodied them in a unique artistic form, thus revealing to us the noble soul of the great Chinese people. We should be very grateful to them for this!

### 古老传说的现实性

　　古老传说的现实性
　　苏联作家、斯大林奖金获得者　阿·莫罗卓夫
    我关于中国戏剧艺术的概念，长时期限于中国古老的传统戏剧的范围。并且，这些概念主要是从讲演中或是博物馆中得到的。中华人民共和国越剧团的演出将使我永志不忘的不仅是我同我们友好的新中国艺术界第一次相识的欢欣，而且是由于一切看到和听到的真正的艺术感受所引起的极度兴奋。戏剧的演出达到了巨大而非凡的技巧，做到了容易了解，同时艺术语言又是独特和富有表现力的。
    越剧团的全体人员给我们展示了中国古老的诗篇——崇高的情感、思想和愿望的诗篇——的新世界。人民永远梦想美好的、崇高的和自由的生活，并且把自己的梦想编成歌曲和故事。优美的歌曲和故事号召人们前进，激起人们对社会的不公道、邪恶和压迫的愤怒。真正人民的诗篇永远在走着不同历史发展道路的各国人民心中得到共鸣。
    正因为这一点，在民间传说基础上创作的歌剧“梁山伯与祝英台”才使苏联的观众入迷和感动。
    凝结在独特的民间艺术形式中的事实的高度真实性，生动地并直接地感动着我们。这种经过长期锤炼成的、对于我们是生疏的表现方法，不仅不因为它的奇异而妨碍我们领会，反而更加强了美感印象的效果。这同“外国情调”，同欣赏不习惯的艺术毫无共同之处。
    由另一个民族所揭示和创造的艺术规律性的成就，给我们展现了这个民族独有的民族的和历史的特征。历史的现实是取之不尽的，而它的实际反映形式也是非常丰富的。因此，保留民族特征，继承有时是来自往昔的古老艺术传统，是真正的、高度的现实主义艺术的不可缺少的条件。对于现实不是毫无声色地摹拟，而是在真实的、诗意的形象中表现它。越剧团的演员们正是创造了这种形象！
    梁山伯和祝英台是人民的光明希望的化身。他们冲破了限制他们的社会环境。对于知识的热爱，对于书籍和教育的尊重，都强调表现出他们的思想和意愿的高尚的人道主义，使他们成为人类完全解放的新思想的预言者。
    梁山伯和祝英台的故事不单纯是两个情人的故事，也不仅是关于爱情和忠实的诗篇。这一对情人是具有伟大生命力的人。但是，这种生命力的表现不仅在于肯定了个人自由和个人幸福的权利，当然，这种肯定本身就是对封建社会结构的一种大胆的挑战。充满着崇高的情感和痛苦的歌剧主角，号召走向更好的未来，并预示着这个未来。因此，他们的死本身就是一种凯旋和胜利，就是一种乐观主义和对未来的幸福充满信心的源泉。他们使我们的智慧和心灵开朗起来。
    女演员范瑞娟创造了梁山伯这样一个温柔的、富于理想的青年的卓越形象，他正直而勇敢，聪明而天真，无论对人对己都是真诚的。在祝英台（女演员傅全香扮演）的美丽的机智里，包含着第一次承认爱情时的温柔，她竭力想用暗示和双关语向梁山伯吐露自己的秘密。
    描述旅途的整个第四景，充满了异乎寻常的抒情的魔力。在一个小小舞台上体现出十八里长的旅途，可以看作是真正的戏剧现实主义的高度成就。梁山伯和祝英台在静止的舞台布景前行走，而观众却当真觉得风景时时在变化着，觉得在他们所经过的途中出现了群山和陡峭的上下坡，觉得道路是在沿着绿色的小丘蜿蜒。于是，我们面前的潺潺的小河上有了一座摇摇欲坠的小拱桥。这个青年和少女显然是走过了这座桥。在小桥旁边，祝英台说了关于牛郎和织女一年一度鹊桥相会的寓言。
    情感和演技的真实性，是永远比任何舞台道具都更有说服力的。如果在舞台上出现了小桥和小河的舞台布景，难道就能在这种真实性上添加些什么吗？这座小桥无论是用怎样的艺术风格建立起来的，也不管它本身是怎样轻巧而优美，它也未必能给形象的艺术真实性添加什么。我们知道，所谓真正的现实主义并不是单纯摹拟生活中所直接看到的东西，而是要发掘全部现实的真正的和深刻的内容，其中包括从思想和道德上对现实所作的评价。
    关于梁山伯和祝英台的富于诗意的传说，给我们揭示了旧中国社会关系中的异常真实的历史现实，这种社会关系是在具体的历史基础上形成的。越剧团的演员们把那个时代所能产生的最纯洁和最富人情的东西抽取出来，并把它们体现在独特的艺术形式中，这样就在我们眼前揭示了伟大的中国人民的崇高的心灵。为了这件事是应当多多感谢他们的！
