　　Reactions to the Newspaper's Criticism
    On July 4th, this newspaper published an article titled "Astonishing Waste," criticizing the extravagant and wasteful behavior of the state-owned Shijiazhuang No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory. Now, Zhang Tianxing, the director of the factory's construction preparation office, has sent a letter of self-criticism. The letter states that they have recently revised the basic construction plan, reducing the unfinished contracted projects from 1954 by 3% according to the plan. In addition, they have cut six projects, totaling 166,000 yuan. For self-managed projects, the total reduction is 1.79 million yuan. They have also organized an inspection team to return all surplus materials to the warehouse for processing, transferring what can be transferred, and selling what cannot be transferred. Surplus furniture is currently being sold. Furthermore, they have improved the property management system and material requisition procedures. Several conservation measures have also been taken in production.
