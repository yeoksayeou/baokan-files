    Anqing City Strengthens Ideological Education in Grain Unified Sales

    Li Wei, Secretary of the Anqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

    Anqing City rectified its grain unified sales work in June on the basis of raising the ideological awareness of cadres and the masses. All units and households have formulated plans for saving grain. Grain sales in June decreased significantly, with residents' grain consumption decreasing by 13.91 percent compared to April; grain consumption by collective catering units such as government agencies, organizations, enterprises, and schools decreased by 32.92 percent. In this rectification of grain unified sales, we deeply realized that the process of rectifying grain unified sales is a process of mobilizing and educating the masses. Only by doing a good job in ideological education can the rectification of grain unified sales achieve the expected results.

    Since the Municipal Party Committee determined that rectifying urban grain unified sales would be the central task for the city in June, municipal-level agencies and organizations immediately dispatched a large number of staff to the districts, cooperating with trained grassroots staff, propagandists, and street activists in the districts. Under the unified leadership of the district committees, they carried out publicity and education work on rectifying grain unified sales among the residents. At the same time, the heads of various agencies and organizations personally made mobilization reports to the staff and led the organization of study discussions to clarify various ideological doubts about the rectification of grain unified sales among the staff, Party members, and Youth League members. The districts also used various propaganda tools such as radio stations, blackboards, cartoons, and slideshows to widely publicize throughout the city, creating an atmosphere of saving grain and opposing waste.

    In the propaganda, we first guided the masses to recall the pain of buying grain in the past, so that they could recognize the correctness and necessity of the grain unified sales policy from their own experiences. Many residents recalled the tragic scene after the massive flood in 1931 before liberation, when grain merchants hoarded and speculated, making it impossible to buy rice, and some people were starved to death; they recalled the tragic events in 1947 when reactionary Kuomintang officials and unscrupulous merchants colluded to hoard rice, causing rice prices to soar wildly and leading to bloodshed during rice grabbing; they also recalled that after the flood in 1949 after liberation, the People's Government transported grain from the north to supply the market and crack down on the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants; especially after suffering from a once-in-a-century flood last year, the government immediately transferred a large amount of grain, organized consignment shops, and delivered grain to homes, ensuring supply and maintaining stable grain prices. These vivid factual comparisons greatly enlightened the masses, and many people expressed their sincere support for the grain unified sales policy. A porter said, "In the past, I had no money to buy rice in the morning, and nowhere to buy rice in the evening. The next day, the price would rise and I couldn't afford to buy it. Without unified purchase and sales of grain, how could there be such benefits!" Resident Grandma Xu said, "During the great flood in 1931, I ate tree bark and grass roots, and my stomach was as swollen as a drum; last year, with such a big flood, I could still eat grain. If it weren't for the Communist Party, I would have starved to death and no one would have cared." After careful calculation, this old lady voluntarily reduced her household grain consumption plan by thirty catties.

    After enlightenment and education, the broad masses deeply realized the benefits of grain unified sales from their actual lives, but some people still did not clearly understand the significance and necessity of rectifying grain unified sales, and had ideological concerns, fearing that the grain supply would not be enough and they would go hungry, etc. In response to these ideological concerns, we identified the serious waste and loopholes existing in the grain supply and used examples to educate, breaking the ideological concerns of some residents. For example, the grain consumption plan set by 51 households on Science Street in Chengzhong District averaged 29.8 catties per person. According to the actual amount of grain purchased from January to May of this year, the average was only 25.15 catties per person, indicating that the rationing was too high, exceeding the actual grain needed by a large amount; at the same time, due to lax management, new phenomena such as reselling grain, trafficking, and speculation occurred in the market. Six restaurants in Chengzhong District privately traded and resold more than 1,000 catties of rice in one month. Zhang Shaohe, a resident of Yingjiang Residents' Committee, specifically borrowed other people's grain purchase certificates to buy rice and resell it, raising the price by three cents per catty. These examples specifically proved that there were still many loopholes in the grain supply. Grain was supplied to those who should not have been supplied, and more grain was supplied to those who should have been supplied less, making the broad masses realize the urgency and necessity of eliminating unreasonable grain supply and eliminating misunderstandings and illusions about the policy of rectifying grain unified sales. On this basis, we then carried out education on supporting national construction and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, inspiring the masses to further expose and criticize various wastes and loopholes in the grain supply, and formulate practical grain saving plans.

    In the publicity and education on saving grain, the broad urban residents all understood that grain is grown by the farmer brothers "facing the loess and with their backs to the sky," and further realized the truth of "every grain is hard-earned." Many families actively tried to improve cooking methods, set grain saving plans, and educated children not to waste a single grain of rice. When training street activists, the Chengxi District Committee cultivated 96 typical figures in saving grain, relying on them to persuade the masses, spread experience, and drive the broad residents to consciously formulate grain saving plans. Facts have proved that this kind of typical demonstration and mass self-education has a very good effect. Now, the city's residents are beginning to understand the importance of strictly implementing the urban grain unified sales system, laying a good ideological foundation for urban grain unified sales work.

    安庆市整顿粮食统销中的思想教育工作
    中共安庆市委书记　李微
    安庆市六月份在提高干部群众思想觉悟的基础上整顿了粮食统销工作。各单位各居民户都制定了节约粮食的计划。六月份粮食销量显著下降，居民用粮较四月份下降了百分之十三点九一；机关、团体、企业、学校等集体伙食单位用粮下降百分之三十二点九二。在这次整顿粮食统销工作中，我们深深体会到整顿粮食统销的过程，就是发动和教育群众的过程，只有作好思想教育工作，粮食统销的整顿才能收到预期的效果。
    自市委确定整顿城市粮食统销为全市六月份的中心工作后，市级各机关、团体立即抽调大批工作人员分配至各区，配合各区经过训练的基层工作人员、宣传员以及街道积极分子，在区委统一领导下，在居民中间进行了整顿粮食统销的宣传教育工作。同时，各机关、团体负责人都亲自向工作人员作了动员报告，并领导组织学习讨论，澄清了工作人员和党员、团员中对整顿粮食统销工作的各种思想疑虑。各区又运用广播台、黑板报、漫画、幻灯等各种宣传工具，在全市范围内广泛宣传，造成了节约粮食、反对浪费的气氛。
    在宣传中，首先引导群众回忆过去买粮食时的痛苦，使群众从切身经验中认识粮食统销政策的正确和必要。不少居民回忆到解放前一九三一年大水后，粮商囤积居奇，买不到米，有的人被活活饿死的凄惨情景；回忆到一九四七年国民党反动官吏和奸商相互勾结囤积大米，使米价疯狂上涨，造成抢米流血的惨剧；又回忆到解放后一九四九年遭水灾后人民政府从北方运来粮食供应市场打击了奸商操纵的事实；特别是去年遭受了百年未有的大水灾后，政府立即调来大批粮食，组织代销店，送粮上门，保证供应，粮价始终平稳。这些鲜明的事实对比，大大启发了群众的觉悟，许多人对粮食统销政策表示衷心拥护。搬运工人说：“过去早上无钱买米，晚上无处买米，第二天涨价买不起米；现在水烧在锅里去买米也不迟。不是粮食统购统销，那有这样好处！”居民徐老奶奶说：“一九三一年发大水，我吃树皮草根，肚子胀得像鼓一样；去年这样大水，我还能吃到粮食，要不是共产党，我饿死也无人问。”这位老奶奶经过仔细计算，自动地把家中用粮计划减去了三十斤。
    经过启发和教育，广大群众从实际生活中深刻体会到粮食统销的好处，但对整顿粮食统销的意义和必要，有些人还认识不清，思想上有顾虑，怕粮食供应不够饿肚子等等。针对这些思想顾虑，找出粮食供应中存在的严重浪费和漏洞，以实例进行教育，打破了某些居民的思想顾虑。如城中区科学街五十一户居民定的用粮计划，平均每人合二十九斤八两，按本年一至五月实际购买粮数计算，每人平均仅二十五斤十五两，说明定量偏高，超过实际需用粮数很多；同时，由于管理不严，市场上发生了新的粮食套购、贩运、投机等现象。城中区六个饭店私自交易和套购囤积的大米，一个月即有一千多斤。迎江居民委员会居民张少和专门借别人购粮证买米，转手卖出，每斤要抬价三分钱。这些实例具体证明了粮食供应中还有很多漏洞，不该供应的供应了，该少供应却多供应了，使广大居民认识到消除粮食不合理供应的迫切和必要，消除了对整顿粮食统销政策的误解和错觉。在这个基础上，接着进行支援国家建设和巩固工农联盟的教育，启发群众进一步揭发和批判粮食供应中的各种浪费和漏洞，订出切合实际的节约粮食计划。
    在节约粮食的宣传教育中，广大城市居民，都了解粮食是农民兄弟“面朝黄土背朝天”种出来的，进一步体会到“粒粒皆辛苦”的道理。不少家庭都积极设法改进做饭方法，定出节约粮食的计划，教育儿童不糟蹋一粒粮食。城西区委在训练街道积极分子时，培养了节约粮食的典型人物九十六人，依靠他们说服群众，传播经验，带动广大居民自觉制定节约用粮计划。事实证明，这种典型示范和群众性的自我教育，效果很好。现在全市居民开始了解到严格执行城市粮食统销制度的重要，为城市粮食统销工作打好了思想基础。
