    Declaration of the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs

    The First World Conference for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, held in Hiroshima – the site of the world's first atomic bombing – for three days starting on August 6, 1955, the anniversary of that bombing, has further strengthened the determination that the demand for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs can and will be realized, that the forces plotting atomic warfare can and will be crushed, and that atomic energy will be harnessed for the happiness and prosperity of mankind.

    We appeal to the people of the world, to the people of all countries, regardless of political party or social system, to further and powerfully advance the movement to prohibit atomic and hydrogen bombs.

    This Conference for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs is being held in response to the global public opinion demanding world peace. The fact that the conference is being held after the Geneva Four-Power Summit has particularly profound significance. The conference appeals to the whole world to develop this force into a tremendous power to ease international tensions and to enable the United Nations Disarmament Committee and the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference to reach an agreement on this issue.

    The transportation of atomic rocket launchers, the storage of atomic weapons, and the expansion of military bases are all linked to the preparation for atomic warfare. We must coordinate the movements against military bases and for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs and carry out the struggle.

    Our movement, starting today, must continue until humanity achieves true peace. The world's hope for peace illuminates the future.

    禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会宣言
    要求禁止原子弹和氢弹的第一次世界大会，从一九五五年八月六日——世界上第一颗原子弹投下的日子起的三天内，在原子弹投下的地方——广岛举行。大会更加坚定了这样的决心：禁止原子弹和氢弹的要求一定能够实现，一定能够粉碎策划原子战争的力量，而使原子能为人类的幸福和繁荣服务。
    我们向全世界的人们号召，世界上一切国家的人们要不问政党派别和社会制度的不同，进一步强有力地推进禁止原子弹和氢弹运动。
    这个禁止原子弹和氢弹大会是根据要求世界和平的舆论而举行的。特别是大会在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议以后举行这一点具有非常深远的意义。大会向全世界呼吁，要使这种力量发展成为缓和国际紧张局势、并且使联合国裁军委员会和四国外交部长会议在这个问题上达成协议的巨大力量。
    运进原子火箭发射器、储藏原子武器和扩大军事基地是同准备原子战争有联系的，我们必须使反对军事基地和禁止原子弹和氢弹的运动互相配合起来，进行斗争。
    我们的运动，今天就是起点，必须开展下去，直到人类获得真正的和平为止。全世界对和平所抱的希望照耀着未来。
