　　The Benefits of the Township Grain Rationing System
    Li Sen

　　The township grain rationing system is about to be implemented. Based on many years of personal experience, people know that the various systems and measures enacted by the People's Government are beneficial to the country and the people; the grain rationing system is naturally no exception. What are the benefits of this system?

　　The most important benefit of this system is that it can more effectively eliminate waste and conserve grain.

　　In order to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, improve farmers' enthusiasm for production, develop agricultural production, and advance the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, the state has decided to implement the measures of "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" for grain; and has determined figures for grain purchases lower than those of the 1954-1955 grain year, which will remain unchanged for three years starting from the 1955-1956 year. The people of the whole country warmly support these measures. People know that the state purchased 86.5 billion jin of grain in 1953-1954, and the amount of grain purchased in 1954-1955 was slightly higher than the previous year. The figures for grain purchased in both of these years are higher than the figures projected for grain purchases in 1955-1956. Now that the state is purchasing less grain than in the past, the amount of grain sold must also be less than in the past. This means that in the next few years, the amount of grain sold must be lower than the level of 1953-1954 in order to ensure that the state's grain supply plan is not breached and to strive to save several billion jin of grain each year as necessary state reserves.

　　However, the current grain sales situation, especially the grain sales situation in the past period, is completely contrary to this requirement. The amount of grain sold in rural areas greatly exceeded the plan this spring, and the amount of grain sold in townships has also seen a very abnormal increase since the second half of last year. According to statistics from 240 large and medium-sized cities, the average monthly grain sales from September to December last year was 10.38 percent higher than the average monthly sales before August last year. The population of Beijing increased by 14 percent in the first quarter of 1955 compared to the first quarter of 1954, but grain sales increased by 35 percent. Taking the average monthly grain sales in Wuhan from January to September 1954 as 100, it increased to 139.19 in December, and further increased to 148.15 in April this year. The city's population increased by 2.1 percent in March this year compared to January, but grain sales increased by 12.87 percent. Some of the extra grain sold in townships was wasted, some was hoarded, and some was transported to the countryside by speculators to seek exorbitant profits. At this time, the state's grain supply plan was threatened, and the peasants were naturally very dissatisfied, and the patriotic and law-abiding township residents also had opinions. Everyone unanimously demanded that the government take effective measures to change this abnormal phenomenon.

　　　Responding to the demands of the broad masses of people, the state began to widely promote grain conservation in townships across the country in March, and then, on the basis of extensive and in-depth ideological education, implemented the method of verifying grain supply by household. This method of verifying supply by household greatly reduced the phenomena of falsely reporting the number of people to obtain extra grain and hoarding and speculating in grain, and effectively compressed the amount of grain sold in townships. According to statistics from 238 cities, grain sales in June decreased by 8 percent compared to May, and continued to decrease in July and August. This method not only compressed the amount of grain sold in townships, but also enabled the state to further grasp the grain supply and demand situation in townships, laying a good foundation for the quantitative supply system.

　　However, the method of verifying supply by household has not completely eliminated the unreasonable phenomena in township grain supply. This is because the method of verifying supply by household does not determine a unified and scientific quantitative standard. Some residents' planned grain purchases are still too high, and the waste of grain cannot be completely avoided. In Beijing, one household made a plan to use 30 jin of grain per month for a three-year-old child and 15 jin of grain per month for a one-year-old infant. Isn't this almost absurd? However, this kind of thing is not isolated. In Shanghai, the supply plans verified by residents, collective mess units, and other parties in July totaled 210 million jin, but the actual amount of grain sold for the entire month was only 201 million jin; even in the grain that was sold, there were still excessive and unreasonable portions. Implementing the system of verifying supply by household requires township residents to formulate grain purchase plans every month, and the competent authorities to approve residents' grain purchase plans every month, which is complicated and requires a lot of work. In order to overcome these shortcomings and strictly conserve grain, it is absolutely necessary to determine and implement a more scientific and more reasonable system on the basis of verifying supply by household. The grain rationing system is such a system. First, the rationing system is "quantitative according to person," and each person can only buy one portion of grain and cannot buy two portions of grain. In this way, the phenomenon of falsely reporting the number of people to repurchase and falsely claim grain is eliminated. Second, each person can not only buy one portion of grain, but also only buy a portion of grain suitable for his or her actual needs according to the difference in labor and age. Residents who do heavy labor and adults need more, so they buy more; residents who do light labor and children need less, so they buy less. In this way, the phenomenon of "over-purchasing for backup" and wasting grain is eliminated. Third, grain used by industry and trades is given an appropriate amount of supply according to their normal and actual needs after going through procedures such as planning and approval. In this way, their phenomena of repurchasing, hoarding, and speculating in grain will be further reduced, and even gradually eliminated. Grain for livestock feed in townships will also be supplied in appropriate amounts after going through similar procedures. Loopholes in this area will also be gradually plugged.

　　After the implementation of the rationing system, it is estimated that the country can save from several billion jin to tens of billions of jin of grain each year. Assuming that the country saves 3.5 billion jin of grain each year, then this batch of grain is enough for 10 million people to eat for a year. What a huge number! Everyone knows that if the state cannot control enough grain, if the grain market cannot be stable for a long time, and if the people in urban and rural areas cannot get an appropriate amount of grain, the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation cannot proceed smoothly. If the state does not have the necessary grain reserves, it will not be able to cope with the two unexpected events that may occur: imperialist wars of aggression and major disasters. From this, it can be seen how much the implementation of the grain rationing system and the strict conservation of grain are in line with the fundamental and long-term interests of the people of the whole country.

　　The grain rationing system is in line with the immediate interests of township residents. This system can help them better formulate life plans, eliminate waste, and save expenses. Some working people who rely on wages often "have plenty of money at the beginning of the month and little money at the end of the month" due to poor life planning, which is very inconvenient. After the implementation of the rationing system, there is a fixed amount of how much grain to buy each month and how much it costs; in this way, they can better and more plannedly allocate their wages, and their lives will not be "sometimes loose and sometimes tight."

　　The rationing system can also promote township residents to pay more attention to saving grain. In the past, township residents often wasted grain, and one of the important reasons was that they could buy it at will. After the implementation of the rationing system, the amount of grain purchased by township residents has been subject to necessary and reasonable restrictions, so they will create various ways to save grain. After Beijing and other townships implemented household-based supply verification, many working people used the savings from grain to improve their non-staple food and improve their living standards. Now that the rationing of grain is being further implemented in various townships, if the residents here can better arrange their lives and save grain, their lives will inevitably be further improved.

　　Will the implementation of grain rationing cause some "inconvenience" to township residents? Yes, there will be. For example, buying grain for travel, relocation, or changes in the nature of work will involve certain procedures, which did not exist in the past, so this can be said to be "inconvenient." However, these "inconveniences" are insignificant compared to the great cause of conserving grain and building socialism, and every patriotic and law-abiding township resident should consciously take on this responsibility and assist the state in smoothly promoting this major measure to improve our country's grain distribution system.

　　After the implementation of grain rationing, will the grain that some people should buy be insufficient to eat? Due to special reasons, the grain that individual people should buy may be slightly insufficient. But there are also some people who should buy slightly more grain than they need. They can solve this by means of mutual adjustment and do not need to worry at all. Of course, those who have surplus grain can only help those who do not have enough grain at a fair and reasonable price. If they use grain for speculation and profit, it is an illegal act and is absolutely not allowed.

　　市镇粮食定量供应制度的好处
    李森
    市镇粮食定量供应制度就要实行了。人们根据多少年来的切身经验，都知道人民政府规定的各种制度，实行的各种措施，都是对国家、对人民有利无害的；粮食定量供应制度自然也不例外。这种制度的好处究竟是什么呢？
    这种制度的好处，最重要的是能够更有效地杜绝浪费，节约粮食。
    国家为了巩固工农联盟，提高农民的生产情绪，发展农业生产，推进国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，决定实行粮食“定产、定购、定销”的措施；并且确定了低于一九五四—一九五五粮食年度征购粮食的数字，这个数字从一九五五—一九五六年度开始，三年不变。全国城乡人民热烈拥护这种措施。人们知道，国家在一九五三—一九五四年度连征带购粮食八六五亿斤，在一九五四—一九五五年度征购粮食的数字略高于上年度，这两年度征购粮食的数字，都高于预计在一九五五—一九五六年度征购粮食的数字。现在国家征购的粮食既然比过去少了，销售的粮食也必须比过去少。这就是说，今后几年，粮食销售量必须低于一九五三—一九五四年度的水平，这才能保证国家的粮食供应计划不被突破，并争取每年节约几十亿斤粮食，作为国家必要的储备。
    但是，目前的粮食销售状况，特别是过去一段时间的粮食销售状况，却同这种要求完全相反。农村粮食销售量，在今年春季曾经大大突破计划，市镇的粮食销售量，也从去年下半年开始了很不正常的上升。据二百四十个大中城市统计，去年九至十二月每月平均粮食销售量比去年八月以前每月平均销售量多百分之十点三八。北京市一九五五年第一季度比一九五四年第一季度增加人口百分之十四，粮食销售量却增加了百分之三十五。武汉市以一九五四年一至九月份每月平均粮食销售量为一○○，十二月份增至一三九点一九，今年四月份更增至一四八点一五。该市今年三月份人口比一月份增加了百分之二点一，粮食销售量却增加了百分之十二点八七。市镇多销售的粮食，有些被浪费了，有些被囤积起来，有些被投机者运到乡下牟取暴利。这时候，国家的粮食供应计划受到威胁，农民固然很不满意，爱国守法的市镇居民也有意见，大家一致要求政府采取有效措施，改变这种不正常的现象。
　　　国家适应广大人民的要求，从三月开始在全国各市镇普遍进行节约粮食的宣传，接着在广泛、深入的思想教育的基础上，实行粮食按户核实供应办法。这种按户核实供应的办法，使虚报人数套购粮食和囤积、私贩粮食的现象大为减少，市镇粮食销售量被有效地压缩下来。据二三八个城市统计，六月份粮食销售量比五月份减少了百分之八，七、八月份续有减少。这种办法不仅压缩了市镇粮食销售量，而且使国家进一步掌握了市镇粮食供需情况，给定量供应制度打下良好的基础。
    但是，按户核实供应办法还未能彻底消除市镇粮食供应中的不合理现象。这是因为按户核实供应办法并没有确定统一的、科学的定量标准，有些居民定的购粮计划还是偏高，不能完全避免粮食的浪费。北京市有一户居民，给三岁的孩子作了每月用粮三十斤的计划，给一周岁的婴儿作了每月用粮十五斤的计划，这不是近于胡闹吗？但是，这种事情却不是个别的。上海市居民、集体伙食单位和其他方面在七月份核实的供应计划为二亿一千万斤，全月实际销售的粮食只有二亿零一百多万斤；已销售的粮食，还有过多的和不合理的部分。实行按户核实供应制度，需要市镇居民月月制定购粮计划，主管机关月月批准居民的购粮计划，手续繁复，工作份量很大。为了克服这些缺点，严格节约粮食，在按户核实供应的基础上，确定和实行一种更加科学和更加合理的制度，是完全必要的。粮食定量供应制度就是这样的制度。第一、定量供应制度是“以人定量”，每个人只能买一份粮食，不能再买两份粮食。这样，虚报人数重购冒领的现象就消除了。第二、每人不仅只能买一份粮食，而且只能按照劳动差别、年龄大小，购买适合他的实际需要的一份粮食。重劳动的居民和成年人需要的多，买的数量就多；轻劳动的居民和儿童需要的少，买的数量就少。这样，“宽打备用”、浪费粮食的现象就消除了。第三、工业和行业用粮，是按照它们正常和实际的需要，经过计划、批准等手续，给以适量的供应。这样，它们套购、囤积、私贩粮食的现象将会进一步的减少，以至逐步消灭。市镇牲畜饲料用粮，也要经过类似的手续，进行适量的供应。这方面的漏洞，也将逐渐被堵塞住。
    实行定量供应制度以后，估计全国每年能节约粮食十几亿斤到几十亿斤。假定全国每年节约粮食三十五亿斤，那末，这批粮食就够一千万人吃一年，多么巨大的数字！谁都知道，国家如果不能掌握足够的粮食，粮食市场如果不能长期稳定，城乡人民如果得不到适量的粮食，国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，是不能顺利进行的。国家如果没有必要的粮食后备，更不能应付可能发生的帝国主义侵略战争和可能发生的大灾荒这两种意外事变。由此可见，实行粮食定量供应制度，严格节约粮食，是多么符合全国人民的根本利益和长远利益。
    粮食定量供应制度是符合市镇居民的切身利益的。这种制度能帮助他们更好地制定生活计划，消灭浪费，节省开支。有些依靠工薪生活的劳动人民，由于生活计划不周到，常常是“月初钱松，月底钱紧”，很不方便。实行定量供应制度以后，每月要购买多少粮食，需要多大的开支，都有了固定的数目；这样，他们就能更好地、更有计划地支配自己的工薪，他们的生活就不会“时松时紧”了。
    定量供应制度还能推动市镇居民更加注意节约粮食。过去市镇居民所以常常浪费粮食，重要原因之一是他们可以随意购买。实行定量供应制度以后，市镇居民购买粮食的数量有了必要的、合理的限制，这样，他们就会创造各种办法来节约粮食。北京市和其他市镇实行按户核实供应以后，都有许多劳动人民，利用从粮食方面节约的开支来改善副食，提高了生活水平。现在各市镇进一步实行粮食定量供应，这里的居民如果能够更好地安排生活，节约粮食，他们的生活必然可以获得进一步的改善。
    实行粮食定量供应，对市镇居民有没有一些“不方便”呢？是有的。例如，因为旅行、迁移、劳动性质变换而购买粮食，都增加了一定的手续，过去没有这些手续，这就可以说是“不方便”。但是，这些“不方便”同节约粮食建设社会主义的大事业相比较，是微不足道的，每一个爱国守法的市镇居民，都应该自觉地把它承担起来，协助国家顺利推行这种改进我国粮食分配制度的重大措施。
    实行粮食定量供应以后，有些人应买的粮食会不会不够吃呢？个别的人由于特殊原因，应买的粮食可能稍感不足。但另外还有些人，应买的粮食可能稍有剩余。他们可用互相调剂的方法加以解决，完全不必发生顾虑。当然，粮食有余的人只能按照公平合理的价格帮助粮食不够用的人，如果利用粮食投机牟利，那是违法的行为，是绝对不能允许的。
