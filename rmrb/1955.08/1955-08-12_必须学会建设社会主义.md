    Must Learn to Build Socialism
    Lin Yushi
    We are building socialism, we are implementing the first Five-Year Plan, which is an extremely glorious and great cause that our predecessors have never undertaken. But it is also an extremely complex and arduous undertaking. Because our country is a large country with a very backward economy, and there are still various economic components in our country during the transition period, coupled with the fact that the unresigned imperialists and domestic and foreign reactionaries are constantly attempting to restore capitalism in China, this makes it inevitable for us to encounter many unimaginable difficulties on our way forward.
    We communists never shy away from difficulties, but we are never afraid of difficulties either. We have come from difficulties and are known for being good at overcoming difficulties. The source of difficulties comes from two aspects: from the enemy of nature, or from the enemy of society. Both in nature and in society, all new forces, by their very nature, are always invincible. And all old forces, no matter how large their number, will always be eliminated. Therefore, as long as we have the knowledge of production struggle and class struggle, are familiar with the objective laws of natural and social development, and do not commit or minimize subjective errors, we will be able to overcome them one by one, no matter what difficulties we encounter. The important thing is to be good at learning.
    Just recalling our past history will make us understand this truth. The difficulties we encountered during the democratic revolution period were unprecedented. But because we were good at learning what we didn't understand, we won the victory. We didn't understand politics, so we learned politics. We didn't understand war, so we learned war. Finally, we moved several mountains that seemed difficult to move from the heads of the Chinese people—imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. At that time, some people ridiculed us for "not being able to solve the China problem" and predicted that we would "be eliminated if we go in a straight line, and collapse internally if we go in a curve," that is, we would inevitably perish. Not long after, the mockers became the objects of ridicule, the "prophets" became dreamers, imperialism was driven away, feudalism was eliminated, and the Chinese people stood up.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our country has embarked on the road of socialism. Since 1953, our country has started the construction period of the first Five-Year Plan in accordance with the goals of socialism. Faced with the new task of economic construction, we have encountered many new difficulties, including the contradiction between the technical personnel and equipment supply in industrial construction and the needs of construction, the difficulty that agriculture lags behind the rapid development of industry, and the difficulty of overall arrangement of various economic components in the process of socialist transformation. We lack experience in large-scale economic construction, and most of our cadres have been transferred from the army and the countryside. Although they have accumulated rich experience in the long-term work in the army and the countryside, they are "new recruits" on the industrial front. They are just as Comrade Mao Zedong described: familiar things are put aside, and unfamiliar things are forcing them to learn. In the past few years, under the guidance of the Party and the people, and with the help of Soviet experts, relying on their hardworking learning spirit and tenacious fighting will, some of them have gradually learned economic work and turned from laymen into experts. Imperialists and reactionaries bullied us for not understanding economic work, and repeatedly claimed that China had no possibility of industrialization, or that the Five-Year Plan had failed. However, the achievements on the economic front in the past two years have shown to the world that we not only have the power to complete the great task of the people's democratic revolution, but also have the power to complete the even greater task of socialist construction and socialist transformation. For us communists, there is nothing we cannot learn. As long as we have the determination to learn, "delve into it, for a few months, a year or two, three or five years, we can always learn it."
    Is it okay if we don't learn economic work? No, it's not. We should not only be able to do politics, military affairs, party affairs, and cultural affairs, but also be able to do economic affairs. If we can do everything, but we are incompetent in economics, then we are a group of useless people, we will be overthrown by the enemy, and we will be doomed to perish. Stalin once said to economic workers during the first Five-Year Plan in the Soviet Union: "Do you want our socialist motherland to be broken and lose its independence? If you don't want to, then you should eliminate its backwardness in the shortest possible time and develop the true Bolshevik speed in its socialist economic construction. There is no other way. That is why Lenin said during the October Revolution: 'Either perish, or catch up with and surpass the advanced capitalist countries.'" This principle is equally applicable to our country today. We must step up industrialization to defend and consolidate our country. We are now in a new historical period, carrying out a socialist revolution in an eastern country with 600 million people. To change the historical direction and national face of this country, the country must be basically industrialized within three five-year plans, and catch up with or surpass the most powerful capitalist countries in the world within four or fifty years. The first Five-Year Plan, which was recently adopted by the National People's Congress, is the first major step towards achieving this goal. However, it is not enough to have good subjective wishes to achieve this goal. In addition to relying on the labor enthusiasm of millions of people, we must also have the ability to build the economy, that is, to have all kinds of economic knowledge and technical knowledge. Especially in industrial construction, many large-scale and technically complex factories and mines, from the formulation of plans, geological exploration, scientific research and experiments, preparation of designs, supply of equipment and materials, construction and installation projects, preparation of production, etc., to the solution of water and electricity and transportation, are all very complex processes. If we lack experience and knowledge in this area, it will not only delay construction time, but also bring incalculable losses to the country. In the past few years, some of our comrades have made achievements in learning economic work, but many comrades have made many mistakes in this area. However, the people of the whole country are expecting us to quickly learn this skill with a forgiving heart. Relying on their own experience, the people believe in our loyalty to the people's cause and believe that we will definitely be able to learn it. We have no reason to fail the people's trust and expectation in us, and we must step up our efforts to learn: on the one hand, learn in production and work, summarize our own experience, and improve our own abilities; on the other hand, absorb all the advanced knowledge and the latest technology in the world, and apply them reasonably to production and work.
    We should learn from all fraternal countries, especially from the Soviet Union, which has rich experience and knowledge in building socialism, and learn from Soviet experts. When our country started its first Five-Year Plan, Comrade Mao Zedong called on us to learn from the Soviet Union: "We are going to carry out great national construction, and the work in front of us is arduous, and our experience is not enough. Therefore, we must earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Whether it is within the Communist Party, outside the Communist Party, old cadres, new cadres, technical personnel, intellectuals, and workers and peasants, we must sincerely learn from the Soviet Union. We must not only learn the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, but also learn the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union. We must set off a high tide of learning from the Soviet Union throughout the country to build our country." With the expansion of the scale of national construction and the deepening of work, our task of learning from the Soviet Union is even more urgent. To be honest, our current construction conditions are much better than those of the Soviet Union in those years. In those years, the Soviet Union carried out construction alone in the encirclement of capitalism, and everything had to be started from scratch. But the Soviet communists, under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, learned very well. They learned economic work in a short period of time and built the Soviet Union into a socialist country. It must be said: Whatever the Soviet communists can do, we can definitely do it too. The important thing is to be as good at learning as they are, and to learn from them seriously. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "Some people in the Soviet Communist Party also didn't know how to do economic work at the beginning, and the imperialists also waited for their failure. But the CPSU won, and under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, they not only knew how to make revolution, but also knew how to build. They have built a great, brilliant socialist country. The CPSU is our best teacher, and we must learn from the CPSU."
    We must not only learn to do economic work, but also learn to do political work. We are in a period of transition. The transition period is a period of intense and complex class struggle. The domestic and foreign enemies who are unwilling to fail and be eliminated and the exploiting classes who are about to be eliminated will inevitably take various forms of struggle and intensify their counter-revolutionary activities to sabotage our socialist construction. They know that the Chinese Communist Party enjoys unlimited prestige among the broad masses of the people, and it is very difficult to openly oppose the Communist Party. Therefore, the counter-revolutionary elements have adopted the most insidious and vicious two-faced and concealed forms to destroy our fortress from the inside. But many of us are not very vigilant against such hidden counter-revolutionary elements. Some people only care about their work and don't ask about politics, and some people even create an absurd theory of "work is politics." They say: "Only by doing a good job in work can we build socialism, so doing a good job in work is actually doing politics." This argument is extremely dangerous. This kind of thinking is most welcomed by counter-revolutionary elements. Where this kind of argument is popular, it creates the most favorable conditions for the intrusion and sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements. These comrades simply forgot that politics is class struggle. Building socialism is an extremely sharp political struggle to eliminate the exploiting classes. Without politics and without class struggle, there would be no socialism. We should greatly improve our political vigilance against hidden enemies from the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and learn to distinguish between good people and bad people. Not only learn to be good at distinguishing between good people and bad people who engage in activities under normal circumstances, but also learn to be good at identifying counter-revolutionary elements who engage in activities under special circumstances. With this skill, we can expose all counter-revolutionary conspiracies and protect the fruits of our construction.
    Marxism-Leninism is the science of the laws of development of nature and society, the science of the revolution of the oppressed and exploited masses, and the science of the victory of socialism in all countries. Therefore, all cadres, especially those who are in charge of leading work, should also earnestly study the theory of Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. We know that the victory of the Chinese democratic revolution and the completion of the socialist cause cannot be imagined without the guidance of Marxist-Leninist thought. If Marxist-Leninist thought had not come to China, and without the May Fourth Movement, the face of the Chinese revolution would not have been renewed. If the Yan'an Rectification Movement in 1942 had not re-established the specific policy of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, then we might have made mistakes in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the National Liberation War. The socialist revolution is a more extensive and profound revolution than the democratic revolution. Since the victory of the democratic revolution cannot be separated from the guidance of Marxist-Leninist thought, can the socialist revolution not need the guidance of Marxist-Leninist thought instead? It can be seen from this that mastering Marxist-Leninist theory, especially the foundation of Marxist-Leninist theory—dialectical materialism and historical materialism, is extremely important to the Chinese revolution. Our enemies, starting from their class instinct, fully understand that Marxist-Leninist theory is a very terrible thing for them. As soon as we criticized Hu Shi's bourgeois idealism, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique felt "contradiction and difficulty." Our enemies extremely hate Marxism-Leninism. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, they tried every means to annihilate Marxism-Leninism. When they found that they could not destroy it by open means, they adopted the "digging heart war" of "Sun Wukong drilling into the belly," as Hu Feng said, hoping to replace Marxism-Leninism with anti-Marxist-Leninist thought. The first article of Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary program was to oppose advocating the study of Marxism-Leninism. However, some of our comrades do not understand the importance of studying Marxism-Leninism and criticizing idealism. They believe that theory does not solve practical problems, and that learning or not learning is the same for doing work, and that criticizing idealism has nothing to do with them. They do not understand that advocating or opposing the study of Marxism-Leninism is a fundamental difference between us and counter-revolutionary elements. What counter-revolutionary elements fear most is that we study Marxism-Leninism. If we want to build socialism, we must study Marxism-Leninism.
    Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "The enemy of learning is one's own satisfaction. To seriously learn something, one must start from not being complacent." Communists are not people who are "born with knowledge." His greatest ability is to be able to "learn tirelessly." Because he is a dialectical materialist, he understands that objective things are constantly developing and changing, and new things are emerging endlessly. Therefore, there is no time to learn enough. In fact, not only is industrial construction unfamiliar to us, but new things are constantly appearing in agricultural production, and we cannot "act like old-timers." In the past few years, whether in cities or in the countryside, we have indeed learned a lot, but we are far behind the needs of construction. However, some communists and staff members of institutions are satisfied with their existing achievements and have become proud and complacent. Some people are unwilling to humbly accept experiences and lessons, and are unwilling to expose and overcome shortcomings and errors in their work. Some people feel that they have learned almost everything after learning a little bit, and stick to the old ways and are unwilling to learn new things anymore. Some intellectuals and technical personnel are still satisfied with their own set of old knowledge and old technologies, and hold a contemptuous or distrustful attitude towards the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. All of the above practices and ideas are wrong. We should follow Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions: if you don't understand, you don't understand, don't pretend to understand. Don't put on official airs. Only by maintaining a humble attitude can we learn something.
    Not only that, to master any science, learners also need to have a strong desire, great patience and strong perseverance. Stalin said when he put forward the task of mastering the science of production to economic workers: "This is certainly not an easy thing, but it is a completely solvable thing. Science, technical experience, knowledge, - all of these can be obtained. If you don’t have it today, you will have it tomorrow. The main point here is to have the Bolshevik’s ardent will to master technology and master production science. As long as there is an ardent will, everything can be done and everything can be solved." The greatest and most sublime thought - the thought of building socialism, inspires all our life, work and struggle. This is the source of our fortitude and courage to overcome any difficulties. Yesterday, the motherland needed us to learn armed struggle, and we learned armed struggle with a strong will. Today, the motherland also needs us to learn construction, and we will learn construction with a strong will. There are difficulties, so patience and perseverance are needed. Many examples can be found in the biographies of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, how they studied with such tenacious and unyielding spirit in order to reach the peak of science; but no difficulties can prevent us from learning construction. As the saying goes: "Nothing is difficult in the world, but those who have a heart." Because we are revolutionary workers, we are "people with a heart", and we have the determination to serve the people wholeheartedly and to "build our country into a great socialist republic." Therefore, as long as we are willing to learn and learn hard, there is no peak that we cannot climb.

    必须学会建设社会主义
    林聿时
    我们正在建设社会主义，我们正在执行第一个五年计划，这是我们前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。但这也是极其复杂、艰巨的事业。由于我们的国家是一个经济上非常落后的大国，我国在过渡时期还有多种经济成份，加上，不甘心失败的帝国主义和国内外反动派时时刻刻都企图在中国复辟，这就使得我们在前进的路上不能不遇到许多难以想像的困难。
    我们共产党人从来不讳言困难，但也从来不害怕困难。我们是从困难中走过来的，是以善于克服困难著名的。困难的来源不外乎两方面：来自自然的敌人方面，或者来自社会的敌人方面。不论在自然界和在社会上，一切新生力量，就其性质来说，从来就是不可战胜的。而一切旧势力，不管它们的数量如何庞大，总是要被消灭的。因此，只要具备生产斗争和阶级斗争的知识，熟悉自然和社会发展的客观规律，不犯或少犯主观主义的错误，不管什么困难，我们就有可能一个一个的战胜它们。重要的问题在善于学习。
    只要回忆一下我们过去的历史就会懂得这个道理。我们在民主革命时期所遇到的困难是史无前例的。但是由于我们善于学会我们不懂的东西，我们就赢得了胜利。我们不懂得政治，学会了政治，我们不懂得战争，学会了战争，终于搬动了几座压在中国人民头上的看起来似乎很难搬动的大山——帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义。当时曾有人嘲笑过我们“解决不了中国问题”，预言过我们“走直线则被消灭，走曲线则内溃”，就是说，非灭亡不可的。曾几何时，嘲笑者变为被嘲笑的对象，“预言家”变为梦呓家，帝国主义被赶走了，封建主义被消灭了，中国人民站立起来了。
    自从中华人民共和国成立以后，我国已经走上了社会主义的道路。从一九五三年起，我国已经按照社会主义的目标，开始了第一个五年计划的建设时期。在经济建设的新任务面前，我们又碰到了许多新的困难，其中包括工业建设中技术人材、设备供应同建设需要的矛盾而发生的困难，农业落后于工业的迅速发展而发生的困难，以及在社会主义改造过程中各种经济成份统筹安排的困难。我们缺乏大规模经济建设的经验，我们的干部大部转业自军队和农村。他们虽然曾经在军队、农村的长期工作中积累了丰富的经验，但是在工业战线上却是“新兵”。他们正如毛泽东同志所形容的：熟悉的东西闲起来了，不熟悉的东西却强迫着他们去学。几年来，在党和人民教导下，在苏联专家的帮助下，凭借着刻苦的学习精神和顽强的斗争意志，他们中间有一部分人已经逐步学会了经济工作，从外行变为内行了。帝国主义和反动派欺负我们不懂得经济工作，曾经一再声称：中国没有可能工业化，或者说，五年计划已经失败。但是，过去两年经济战线上的成就向全世界表明：我们不但有力量完成伟大的人民民主革命的任务，而且有力量完成更伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的任务。对于我们共产党人说来，没有什么学不会的东西。只要有学习的决心，“钻进去，几个月，一年两年，三年五年，总可以学会的。”
    我们不学经济工作行不行？不行。我们不但应该会办政治，会办军事，会办党务，会办文化，我们也应该会办经济。如果我们样样能干，惟独对于经济无能，那我们就是一批无用之人，就要被敌人打倒，就要陷于灭亡。斯大林曾在苏联第一个五年计划期间对经济工作人员说过：“你们愿不愿让我们社会主义祖国被人打破而丧失独立呢？如果你们不愿意，那你们就应当在最短时期内消灭它的落后状况，而开展其社会主义经济建设中的真正的布尔什维克的速度。除此而外，再没有别的办法。正因为如此，所以列宁在十月革命时说过：‘或是灭亡，或是赶上并超过先进资本主义国家’。”这个道理今天对于我国同样是适用的。我们必须加紧进行工业化的建设来保卫和巩固我们的国家。我们现在是处在新的历史时期，在一个六万万人口的东方国家举行社会主义革命。要在这个国家里改变历史方向和国家面貌，就必须在三个五年计划期间内使国家基本上工业化、要在四、五十年内追上或赶过世界上最强大的资本主义国家。最近全国人民代表大会所通过的第一个五年计划，就是实现这个目标的第一个重大步骤。但是，要达到这个目标仅有良好的主观愿望是不够的。除了依靠千百万群众的劳动热情以外，还应该有经济建设的本领，就是说，要有各种各样的经济知识和技术知识。特别是在工业建设方面，许多规模巨大、技术复杂的工厂矿山，从计划的制定、地质勘探、科学研究和试验、设计的编制、设备材料的供应、建筑安装工程的进行、生产的准备工作等，到水电、交通的解决都是一个十分复杂的过程。如果我们缺乏这方面的经验和知识，不但会拖延建设时间，而且会给国家带来不可估量的损失。几年来，我们中有些同志在学习经济工作方面确有成绩，但是也有不少同志在这方面已经发生过不少错误，但是，全国人民都怀着原谅的心情，期待着我们迅速学会这方面的本领。人民凭借着切身的经验，相信我们对人民事业的忠心，相信我们是一定能够学会的。我们没有理由辜负人民对我们的信赖和期待，必须加紧努力学习：一方面在生产和工作中学习，总结自己的经验，提高自己的能力；一方面吸收世界上一切先进的知识，最新的技术，并把它们合理地运用到生产和工作中去。
    我们应该向所有的兄弟国家学习，特别应该向有着丰富的建设社会主义经验和知识的苏联学习，向苏联专家学习。在我国开始第一个五年计划的时候，毛泽东同志就号召过我们要学习苏联：“我们要进行伟大的国家建设，我们面前的工作是艰苦的，我们的经验是不够的，因此，要认真学习苏联的先进经验。无论共产党内、共产党外、老干部、新干部、技术人员、知识分子以及工人群众和农民群众，都必须诚心诚意地向苏联学习。我们不仅要学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，而且要学习苏联先进的科学技术。我们要在全国范围内掀起学习苏联的高潮，来建设我们的国家。”随着国家建设规模的扩大和工作的深入，我们学习苏联的任务是更加迫切了。老实说，我们现在的建设的条件，比起当年苏联的条件来是好得多了。当年苏联是在资本主义包围中，单独进行建设，一切都得从头摸起。但是苏联共产党人在列宁和斯大林领导下，学习得非常出色。他们在短时期内就学会了经济工作，把苏联建设成为社会主义的国家。必须说：凡是苏联共产党人能办到的，我们也一定能办到。重要的是要像他们那样地善于学习，是要认真地向他们学习。毛泽东同志教导过我们：“苏联共产党人开头也有一些人不会办经济，帝国主义者也曾等待过他们的失败。但是联共是胜利了，在列宁和斯大林领导之下，他们不但会革命，也会建设。他们已经建设起来了一个伟大的光辉灿烂的社会主义国家。联共就是我们的最好的先生，我们必须向联共学习。”
    我们不但要学会做经济工作，而且要学会做政治工作。我们正处在过渡时期。过渡时期是一个紧张复杂的阶级斗争时期。不甘失败和被消灭的国内外的敌人和即将被消灭的剥削阶级势必采取各种各样的斗争方式，加紧他们的反革命活动来破坏我们的社会主义建设。他们知道：中国共产党在广大人民群众中享有无限威信，公开反对共产党是很困难的，因此，反革命分子就采取了最阴险毒辣的两面派的、隐蔽的形式，从内部来破坏我们的堡垒。但是我们有很多人，对于这种暗藏的反革命分子的警惕性是很不高的。有些人只顾埋头业务，不问政治，甚至有人制造出一种“业务即政治”的荒谬理论。他们说：“只有搞好业务才能建设社会主义，所以搞业务实际上就是搞政治。”这议论是极端危险的。这种思想最受反革命分子欢迎。那里流行着这种论调，那里就为反革命分子的混入和破坏活动创造了最有利的条件。这些同志简直忘记了：政治就是阶级斗争。建设社会主义乃是消灭剥削阶级的极尖锐的政治斗争，离开了政治，离开了阶级斗争，也就没有了社会主义。我们应该从反对胡风反革命集团的斗争中大大地提高对暗藏敌人的政治警惕，学会辨别好人和坏人。不但学会善于辨别在正常情况下从事活动的好人和坏人，而且要学会善于识别在特殊情况下从事活动的反革命分子。有了这个本领，才能把一切反革命的阴谋揭露出来，才能保卫住我们建设的成果。
    马克思列宁主义是关于自然和社会底发展规律的科学，是关于被压迫和被剥削群众革命的科学，是关于社会主义在一切国家中胜利的科学。因此，一切干部，特别是担负领导工作的干部还应该认真学习马克思列宁主义的理论，学习毛泽东同志的著作。我们知道：中国民主革命的胜利和社会主义事业的完成，离开马克思列宁主义的思想指导都是不能想像的。如果没有马克思列宁主义的思想来到中国，没有五四运动，中国革命的面目就不可能为之一新。如果没有一九四二年的延安整风运动再次确立了马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的具体方针，那末，在抗日战争和全国解放的过程中，我们可能还会犯错误。社会主义革命是比民主革命更广泛，更深刻的革命。既然民主革命的胜利离不开马克思列宁主义的思想指导，难道社会主义革命反而可以不需要马克思列宁主义的思想指导么？由此可见，掌握马克思列宁主义理论，特别是马克思列宁主义理论的基础——辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，对中国革命的极端重要性。我们的敌人从阶级本能出发，完全懂得马克思列宁主义理论对他们是非常可怕的东西。我们一开始批判胡适派资产阶级唯心主义，胡风反革命集团即感到“矛盾和困难”。我们的敌人极端憎恨马克思列宁主义，国民党反动派统治时期就曾千方百计地企图剿灭马克思列宁主义。当他们发现用公开的办法摧毁不了时，就采取如同胡风所说的“孙行者钻进肚皮”的“挖心战”，希图用反马克思列宁主义的思想来代替马克思列宁主义。胡风反革命纲领第一条就是反对提倡学习马克思列宁主义。但是，我们有些同志却不懂得学习马克思列宁主义、批判唯心主义的重要性。他们认为理论不解决实际问题，学不学一样做工作，认为批判唯心主义与自己无关。他们不懂得：提倡或者反对学习马克思列宁主义是我们和反革命分子的一个根本的不同点。反革命分子最害怕的就是我们学习马克思列宁主义。我们要建设社会主义就一定要学习马克思列宁主义。
    毛泽东同志教导我们说：“学习的敌人是自己的满足，要认真学习一点东西，必须从不自满开始。”共产党员不是“生而知之”的人，他最大的本领就是能够“学而不厌”。因为他是辩证唯物主义者，他懂得客观事物是在不断地发展着、变化着，新的东西层出不穷，因此，也就没有学够的时候。事实上，不但工业建设对于我们是生疏的东西，就是农业生产也不断地有新东西出现，我们也不能“摆老资格”。几年来，不论在城市、在农村，我们固然学习了不少东西，但比起建设的需要来却远远落在后头。然而，有些共产党员和机关工作人员满足于已有的成绩，竟骄傲自满起来。有些人不肯虚心地接受经验教训，不愿揭露和克服工作中的缺点和错误。有些人学到了一点点就觉得差不多了，故步自封，不愿再学习新鲜东西。有一部分知识分子和技术人员至今还满足于自己的一套旧知识，旧技术，对苏联的先进经验抱着轻视或者不信任态度。以上这些做法和想法都是错误的。我们应该依照毛泽东同志的指示：不懂就是不懂，不要装懂。不要摆官架子。只有保持谦虚态度，才能学到东西。
    不仅如此，要掌握任何一门科学，学习者还需要具有强烈的愿望、巨大的耐心和坚强的毅力。斯大林在向经济工作人员提出掌握生产科学的任务时说：“这当然不是容易的事情，但这是完全可以解决的事情。科学，技术经验，知识，——凡此种种都是可以求得的东西。今天没有，明天就会有了。这里的主要点就是要有布尔什维克的热烈志愿去精通技术，精通生产学。只要有热烈志愿，那就一切都可办到，一切都可解决了。”最伟大崇高的思想——建设社会主义的思想鼓舞着我们底全部生活、劳动和斗争。这是我们克服任何困难的刚毅、勇敢的泉源。昨天祖国需要我们学会武装斗争，我们怀着强烈的志愿去学习武装斗争。今天祖国还需要我们学会建设，我们就怀着强烈的志愿去学习建设。困难是有的，因此需要耐心和毅力，从马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林传记中就可以找到许多范例，他们为着达到科学的顶峰，曾经以多么顽强和百折不挠的精神进行学习；但是没有什么困难能阻挡我们去学会建设的。俗语说的好：“天下无难事，只怕有心人。”因为我们是革命工作者，是“有心人”，有的是全心全意为人民服务和“将我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义共和国”的决心。因此，只要肯学，肯刻苦地学，就没有什么攀登不上的顶峰。
