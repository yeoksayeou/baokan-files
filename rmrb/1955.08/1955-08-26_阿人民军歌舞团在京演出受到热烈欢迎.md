Xinhua News Agency, August 25th: The Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble gave four excellent song and dance performances to 16,000 audience members in Beijing from August 21st to 25th.

Beijing audiences warmly welcomed the performances of the artists from distant Tirana. Group tickets for the four song and dance evenings were sold out within four hours, and when individual tickets were sold, there were always more than a thousand audience members lining up to buy them.

The spacious Labor Theater has been packed these days. For the two performances on the 24th and 25th, there were hundreds of audience members standing in the back rows of the theater. During the ensemble's performances, every program received enthusiastic applause. After repeated curtain calls, the performers re-performed many singing programs.

The ensemble's chorus left an unforgettable impression on the Beijing audience. The chorus, composed of about 70 singers, sang marches praising the Albanian People's Army and heroes in a loud and magnificent voice, and also performed Albanian lyrical folk songs and songs from Russian classical operas excellently. The Albanian folk song "Is there water in this spring," the Chinese songs "The East is Red" and "People of the World are of One Mind," were repeatedly sung at the request of the audience. The "Glory Chorus" from the opera "Ivan Susanin," sung by the choir, was warmly welcomed by the audience. After each performance, the performers took three or four curtain calls, but the applause and cheers in the venue could not be stopped. After the performers sang the "Glory Chorus" on the evening of the 24th, they also added the Russian folk song "Waves of the Heilongjiang River" for the constantly applauding audience.

The audience warmly welcomed Albanian singers Maria Kraja, Gjoni Athanas, Avni Mula, and Stavri Rafael. Their touching emotions and rich voices aroused bursts of applause and laughter from the audience. Every Chinese folk song they sang was repeatedly performed for the audience at each performance. The duets with strong national flavor performed at the evening party also won warm applause.

The four Albanian folk dances performed by the ensemble showed the Albanian people's enthusiastic, humorous, and unrestrained character, and showed the Albanian people's happy and joyful life. These dances were all warmly welcomed. The performers repeatedly took curtain calls after each performance. On the evening of the 25th, the Albanian artists also performed the "Xinjiang Dance," which they had newly learned after coming to China, and received enthusiastic applause from the audience.

The song and dance evening became a gathering of friendship and unity between the Chinese and Albanian people. At the end of the evening on the 25th, the audience in Beijing applauded enthusiastically under the stage, and was reluctant to leave for a long time. Some audience members flocked to the front of the stage, waving to the ensemble members. The ensemble members on the stage also applauded with the audience and threw bouquets of flowers to the jubilant crowd.

　　阿人民军歌舞团在京演出受到热烈欢迎
    新华社二十五日讯　阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团从二十一日到二十五日之间，为北京的一万六千名观众作了四场精采的歌舞表演。
    北京的观众热烈欢迎来自遥远的地拉那的艺术家们的表演。四场歌舞晚会的团体票在四小时内便订购一空，零售的每场座券出售时，总是有一千以上的观众排队购票。
    宽大的劳动剧场这几天都是满座，二十四日和二十五日的两场，剧场后排还有数以百计的站着的观众。在歌舞团演出时，每一个节目都得到热烈的掌声，表演者在多次谢幕后，又重演了许多歌唱节目。
    歌舞团的大合唱给北京的观众留下了难忘的印象。由约七十位歌唱家组成的合唱队，以宏亮而雄壮的歌声演唱了歌颂阿尔巴尼亚人民军队和英雄的进行曲，又出色地演唱了阿尔巴尼亚的抒情民歌和俄罗斯古典歌剧中的歌曲。大合唱中的阿尔巴尼亚民歌“这里的泉井有没有水”，中国歌曲“东方红”和“全世界人民心一条”，曾在观众的要求下多次重唱。合唱队演唱的歌剧“伊凡·苏萨宁”中的“光荣颂”，受到观众热烈的欢迎。每次演唱后表演者三次四次谢幕，还不能使场内的掌声和欢呼声停下来。在二十四日晚表演者演唱“光荣颂”后，还给不停地鼓掌的观众加唱了俄罗斯民歌“黑龙江的波涛”。
    观众热烈欢迎阿尔巴尼亚歌唱家玛丽亚·克拉娅、久尼·阿达纳斯、阿夫尼·穆利亚和斯塔夫里·拉斐尔。他们的感人的情感、丰富的歌声，引起观众们一阵阵的掌声和欢笑声。他们演唱的每一个中国民歌，每场都为观众重复地演唱了一遍。晚会上表演的有浓厚的民族口味的二重唱，也博得热烈的掌声。
    歌舞团演出的四个阿尔巴尼亚民间舞蹈，表现了阿尔巴尼亚人民热情、幽默、豪放的性格，表现了阿尔巴尼亚人民欢愉幸福的生活。这几个舞蹈都受到热烈的欢迎。表演者每次演出后曾一再谢幕。二十五日晚间，阿尔巴尼亚的艺术家们还表演了来中国后新学会的“新疆舞”，受到观众的热烈欢迎。
    歌舞晚会成为中阿两国人民友好团结的集会。在二十五日晚会结束时，北京的观众在台下热烈鼓掌，久久地不愿离去，有的观众涌向台前，向歌舞团人员招手致意，在舞台上的歌舞团人员也和观众一起鼓掌，并把一束束鲜花投向欢腾的人群。
