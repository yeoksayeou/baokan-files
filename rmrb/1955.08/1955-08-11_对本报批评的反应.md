    Response to Criticism from This Newspaper
    This newspaper published an article on May 20th entitled "Let 'Key' Cooperatives be Freed from Heavy Burdens," criticizing some economic departments in Santai County, Sichuan, for increasing the extra burdens on "key" cooperatives. In late June, Guo Zhenji, Secretary of the Santai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, wrote to say that they have now dealt with this issue. The supply and marketing cooperative sold 2,900 jin of moldy and deteriorated cottonseed cake to the "Zunsheng" agricultural cooperative, and the supply and marketing cooperative compensated for the loss at the original price. The supply and marketing cooperative was responsible for repairing three damaged threshing machines. Regarding the unreasonable behavior of the supply and marketing cooperative, the silk instruction station, and other financial and economic departments toward the "Zunsheng" agricultural cooperative, in addition to ordering the comrades who made mistakes to make written self-criticisms, they also made self-criticisms to the members of the agricultural cooperative. The letter said that the county committee was not aware of these acts that harmed the agricultural cooperative beforehand, which exposed the bureaucratic work style of the county committee; in the future, they will strive to overcome this work style and help the economic departments correct their capitalist business ideology.

    对本报批评的反应
    本报五月二十日刊登了“让‘重点’社从重担下解放出来”一文，批评四川三台县的一些经济工作部门加重了“重点”社的额外负担。六月下旬中共三台县委书记郭振基来信说：现在他们已经处理了这个问题。供销社卖给“尊胜”农业社的棉枯中有二千九百斤霉烂变质，由供销社照价赔偿；坏了的打谷机三部由供销社负责修理。关于供销社、蚕丝指导站及其他财经部门在“尊胜”农业社的不合理行为，除令犯错误的同志作书面检查外，并向农业社的社员作了检讨。信中说：县委事前对这些损害农业社的事是不了解的，这暴露了县委有官僚主义作风；今后要努力克服这种作风，并帮助经济工作部门改正资本主义的经营思想。
