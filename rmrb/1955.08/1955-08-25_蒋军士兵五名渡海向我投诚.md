Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, August 22nd: Five Chiang Kai-shek soldiers crossed the sea and defected to the Chinese People's Liberation Army's Fujian Front troops.

　　On August 18th, Chiang Kai-shek bandit "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army" Second Contingent, Forty-first Detachment, sampan team soldiers Cai Huaiyan, Chen Changli, Zeng Dexiu, and Zhang Zhende drove a wooden boat with weapons to defect to our army. They were returning to their original unit after cooperating with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army's 68th Division "search" troops in conducting harassment and sabotage activities against our Dadeng Island, when they steered to our army's position on Wuyu Island to defect.

　　They brought a wooden boat with two motors, two heavy machine guns, and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition.

　　After arriving at our army's position, they all denounced the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army's crimes of capturing fishermen and sailors at sea to use as cannon fodder. They said, "The four of us were all captured by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army while fishing and transporting goods at sea. We suffered all kinds of torture from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, and today we can finally see the light of day again."

　　On the evening of August 15th, Sergeant Chen Acai from the company headquarters of the first company of the 100th regiment of the 34th division of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army stationed on Dadan Island, floated across the sea with a small bamboo tube to defect to our army on the Xiamen front.

　　These five Chiang Kai-shek soldiers were welcomed by the local army and people after their defection.

　　蒋军士兵五名渡海向我投诚
    新华社福建前线二十二日电　蒋军士兵五名渡海向中国人民解放军福建前线部队投诚。
    八月十八日，盘踞在金门岛上的蒋贼“反共救国军”第二总队四十一支队舢板队的士兵蔡怀炎、陈长力、曾德修、张振德驾驶木船一艘携械向我军投诚。他们是在配合蒋贼军六十八师“搜索”部队向我大嶝岛进行袭扰破坏活动后返回原部队的途中，驾驶到浯屿我军阵地投诚的。
    他们带来装有两个马达的木船一只，重机枪两挺，子弹一千多发。
    他们到达我军阵地后，纷纷控诉蒋贼军在海上捕抓渔民、船员充当其炮灰的罪行。他们说，我们四人都是在海上捕鱼和运货的时候被蒋贼军抓去的。我们受尽蒋贼军的折磨，今天才算重见天日。
    八月十五日晚上，盘踞在大担岛上的蒋贼军三十四师一百团一营一连连部中士陈阿财，抱着小竹筒漂过大海向厦门前线我军投诚。
    这五名蒋军士兵投诚归来后，受到当地军民的欢迎。
