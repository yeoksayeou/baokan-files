Your Excellency, Premier of the People's Republic of China, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends:

    First, please allow me to express my gratitude to all the distinguished guests and gentlemen.

    Tonight's banquet, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the independence of the Republic of Indonesia, is hosted by the Indonesian Embassy on behalf of the Republic of Indonesia to celebrate with our friends from China. Therefore, please allow me to once again express my gratitude to the Premier of the People's Republic of China for attending tonight's banquet.

    Tonight, I do not want to observe in detail the situation in Indonesia since August 17, 1945, when Sukarno and Hatta—the current President and Vice-President—declared independence. I only want to state that on August 17, 1945, when the people demanded independence, we did not have a perfect government or experience. All we had was a strong spirit and two pieces of paper: the Declaration of Independence and the Provisional Constitution of Indonesia. At that time, Indonesia did not have perfect staff or an organized army, but they began their struggle for independence, first fighting the remnants of the Japanese army, and then fighting the British army and the organized and experienced Dutch army in Surabaya. As a result, at the end of December 1949, the Netherlands was forced to recognize the complete independence of the sovereignty of the Indonesian government and people.

    Since the countries of the world began to recognize Indonesia's sovereignty, Indonesia's foreign policy has been based on an active and independent stance. The purpose of this policy is to maintain world peace and friendship with our neighbors in Southeast Asia. Therefore, in April 1950, the Indonesian government recognized the government of the People's Republic of China, just as the government of the People's Republic of China recognized our Indonesian government. In January 1951, the government of the People's Republic of China agreed to Indonesia sending a chargé d'affaires to Beijing, and later, in October 1953, the first Indonesian Ambassador arrived in Beijing. Since then, the Indonesian representatives in the People's Republic of China have worked with the government of the People's Republic of China to forge closer relations between the two countries.

    Please allow me to mention the following results of the significant efforts of both sides, results that have fulfilled the hopes of both sides, and results that have brought the two sides closer together:

    A. On November 30, 1953, the Trade Agreement between the Republic of Indonesia and the People's Republic of China was signed.

    B. On July 21, 1954, the Indonesian Art Troupe came to China with the aim of strengthening cultural ties between the two countries.

    C. On September 1, 1954, the Trade Protocol and Payment Agreement between Indonesia and the People's Republic of China were signed.

    D. On April 22, 1955, Indonesian Foreign Minister Dr. Sunario and His Excellency Zhou Enlai, Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China, signed the Treaty on the Issue of Dual Nationality between Indonesia and the People's Republic of China in Bandung.

    E. In addition, at the end of 1954, many Indonesian delegations came to China for visits. Their visits to China gave them a considerable understanding of China's construction in various fields.

    F. The most important and significant effort for closer relations between the two sides was that after Premier Zhou attended the Asian-African Conference in Bandung in April 1955, he officially visited Indonesia at the invitation of the Indonesian government. The result of this visit was the joint statement by Ali Sastroamidjojo and Premier Zhou on April 28, 1955, the content of which, like the purpose of the Asian-African Conference, was mainly to defend world peace, as well as the well-known ten principles of the Bandung Asian-African Conference. Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Indonesia and Premier Ali Sastroamidjojo's return visit to the People's Republic of China allowed the two premiers to hold talks on important issues of mutual concern. Although the results of the talks were limited, they made a significant contribution to reducing the current tensions in Southeast Asia. Therefore, Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Indonesia and Premier Ali Sastroamidjojo's visit to the People's Republic of China are not only beneficial to our two countries, but also of great significance to the world—reducing international tensions for peace and security.

    I take this opportunity to say that the principle of peaceful coexistence is of great significance to the world. The implementation of this principle has been demonstrated by the friendly relations between Indonesia and the People's Republic of China.

    It is very clear that in the development of international politics, the principle of peaceful coexistence can greatly reduce international tensions and is conducive to world peace.

    G. Finally, I would like to express that, recently, in an effort to strengthen friendly relations between the two countries, the People's Republic of China has sent a cultural delegation to Indonesia. The Chinese cultural delegation is still in our country. According to reports, the Indonesian people warmly welcome your cultural delegation. This visit will definitely have good results for the friendly relations between our two countries.

    Your Excellency, Premier Zhou Enlai, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen: A new government has now been formed in Indonesia. In my opinion, this new government will not abandon the principles of the Ali Sastroamidjojo government's foreign policy, because we already know that the policy of Prime Minister Burhanuddin Harahap's new government is to advocate an active and independent foreign policy, with the aim of world peace, and at the same time, to advocate the development of friendly relations between Asian and African countries.

    Therefore, I firmly believe that the existing friendly relations between our two countries will be maintained by the current Burhanuddin Harahap cabinet.

    Please allow me to propose a toast to the friendly relations between Indonesia and the People's Republic of China and to the health of the Premier of the People's Republic of China who is able to attend tonight's banquet.

    Independence!

### 莫诺努图大使的讲话

专栏：

    莫诺努图大使的讲话中华人民共和国总理阁下：诸位贵宾，诸位先生和诸位朋友们：
    首先请允许我向诸位贵宾和诸位先生们，表示谢意。
    今晚的宴会，为的是庆祝印度尼西亚共和国独立的第十周年，由印度尼西亚大使馆代表印度尼西亚共和国来和中国方面的朋友们共同庆祝。因此，请允许我对于中华人民共和国总理能够参加今晚的宴会，再一次地表示谢意。
    今晚我不想详细地观察一九四五年八月十七日苏加诺和哈达——现在的总统和副总统——宣布独立以来我们印度尼西亚国内的情形，我只要述说：我们在一九四五年八月十七日，人民要求独立的时候，我们是没有完善的政府和经验的，我们所有的资本，就是强有力的精神和两张纸，那就是独立宣言和印度尼西亚的临时宪法。那时候印度尼西亚没有完善的职员，也没有有组织的军队，可是他们开始他们的独立奋斗，首先与日本的残军，并在泗水与英国军队及有组织并有经验的荷兰军队作战。结果在一九四九年十二月底，荷兰被迫承认了印度尼西亚政府和人民的主权完全独立。
    自从世界各国开始承认印度尼西亚的主权以来，印度尼西亚的外交政策是以主动的自由为基础的。政策的目的是维持世界和平，以及和东南亚邻邦的友好。因此在一九五○年四月印度尼西亚政府承认了中华人民共和国政府，正如中华人民共和国政府承认了我们印度尼西亚政府一样。在一九五一年一月中华人民共和国政府同意印度尼西亚派遣一位临时代办驻在北京，后来在一九五三年十月又派了第一任的印度尼西亚大使来到了北京。从那时以来，在中华人民共和国的印度尼西亚代表，和中华人民共和国政府共同为了两国间的密切关系而努力。
    请允许我对于双方的显著的努力的结果，满足双方的希望的结果，使双方关系更加密切的结果，述说如下：
    甲、在一九五三年十一月三十日，签订了印度尼西亚共和国和中华人民共和国两国间的贸易协定。
    乙、在一九五四年七月二十一日，印度尼西亚艺术团来到了中国，它的目的就是要加强两国间的文化联系。
    丙、一九五四年九月一日，签订了印度尼西亚与中华人民共和国两国间的贸易议定书及支付协定。
    丁、一九五五年四月二十二日，印度尼西亚外交部长苏纳约博士和中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来阁下，在万隆签订了印度尼西亚和中华人民共和国两国间的双重国籍问题的条约。
    戊、此外，在一九五四年底，有许多印度尼西亚代表团来到中国访问，他们来中国访问，对中国的各方面建设，有了相当的认识。
    己、对双方密切关系的努力最重要而有意义的是：一九五五年四月周总理到万隆参加了亚非会议以后，应印度尼西亚政府的邀请，正式地访问了印度尼西亚。这个访问的结果，就是阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约和周总理在一九五五年四月二十八日的联合声明，它的内容，正如亚非会议的目的一样，主要的是保卫世界和平，以及人所周知的万隆亚非会议的十项原则。周恩来总理访问了印度尼西亚，后来阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约回拜了中华人民共和国，这两位总理对双方可以说是有关重要的问题，作了会谈。虽然谈话的结果不多，可是对于减少目前在东南亚的紧张局势，有了有意义的贡献，因此，周恩来总理访问印度尼西亚和阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理访问中华人民共和国，不但对我们两国有利益，对全世界也有重大的意义——为和平的安全，减少了国际间的紧张。
    我趁这个机会可以说和平共处的原则，对全世界是有重大意义的。这原则能够实行，已经由印度尼西亚和中华人民共和国的友好关系中证明了出来。
    很显明的，在国际政治的发展中，和平共处的原则，很能减少国际间的紧张，并有利于世界和平。
    庚、最后，我要表示，最近中华人民共和国为了加强两国间友好关系的努力，已经派遣了文化代表团到达了印度尼西亚，现在中国文化代表团仍在我们的国内，根据消息，印度尼西亚人民很热烈欢迎你们的文化代表团。这个访问对于我们两国间的友好关系，定能发生良好的结果。
    周恩来总理阁下，诸位贵宾，诸位先生们：目前在印度尼西亚已组成了一个新的政府，据我看来，这个新政府，是不会放弃阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约政府的外交政策的原则的，因为我们已经知道，伯汉努丁·哈拉哈普总理新政府的政策，是主张主动的自由外交政策，以世界和平为目的，同时，主张亚非各国间的友谊关系的发展。
    因此我很相信，我们两国间的幸存的友好关系，将被现在的伯汉努丁·哈拉哈普内阁所维持。
    请允许我提议：为印度尼西亚和中华人民共和国的友好关系和今晚能够参加宴会的中华人民共和国总理的健康干杯。
    独立！
