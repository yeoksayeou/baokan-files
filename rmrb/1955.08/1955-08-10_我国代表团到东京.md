Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th. A seven-member Chinese delegation, led by its head Liu Ningyi, arrived in Tokyo by plane on the afternoon of the 9th at the invitation of the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.

The Chinese delegation was previously unreasonably obstructed by the Japanese government and stranded in Hong Kong, failing to attend the Hiroshima conference of the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs as scheduled. During its stay in Japan, the delegation will participate in the remaining activities of the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.

    我国代表团到东京
    新华社九日讯　东京消息：应邀请参加禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会的中国代表团一行七人，在团长刘宁一的率领下，于九日下午乘飞机抵达东京。
    中国代表团前因日本政府无理阻挠，滞留香港，未能如期参加禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会的广岛会议。代表团在日本期间，将参加禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会的其余活动。
