Good Ways to Open Up Sources of Mule and Horse Mane and Tail Hair
Huang Diechen

    Mule and horse manes and tails are raw materials for making sieve bottom cloth, woolen garment interlining, brushes, musical instrument strings, bowstrings, etc. They are not only widely used domestically, but also an important export commodity.

    China has a large number of mules and horses. However, farmers and herdsmen do not have the habit of shearing mule and horse manes and tails, because they are afraid that the livestock will not look good, be susceptible to colds, or lack strength after shearing their manes and tails. Therefore, livestock companies often feel that the supply of mule and horse mane and tail hair is insufficient.

    The salesmen of the Jiuquan Branch of the China Animal Products Company often pay attention to opening up the sources of mule and horse mane and tail hair. They saw that at the entrance of the Jiuquan City Grain Company's warehouse, many farmers brought horses and mules to deliver grain, sell grain, buy grain, or collect grain for processing every day. Every day at noon, the livestock gathered together, resembling a livestock market. Therefore, they selected several technicians who knew how to shear manes and tails to explain to the farmers that when mule and horse manes and tails grow to a certain length, they will gradually fall off. If they can be sheared and sold in time, it will not only increase their income, but also provide the country with a lot of useful materials. They also persuaded several young farmers to demonstrate shearing the manes and tails of several mules and horses and sell them to the livestock company.

    When the farmers saw that the sheared mule and horse manes and tails could be sold for money immediately, and that the mules and horses looked better after removing their manes and tails, they dispelled their concerns about not daring to shear the manes and tails. Within three to five days, the livestock company mobilized farmers to shear twelve and a half catties of horse tail and thirteen catties and nine taels of horse mane from thirty-three horses, and purchased them all at reasonable prices. Now, many farmers and herdsmen who raise mules and horses are asking to learn the mane and tail shearing technology and are preparing to shear them themselves. The Gansu Provincial Animal Products Company attaches great importance to this method of organizing supply and is promoting it throughout the province.

    开辟骡马鬃尾货源的好办法
    黄涤尘
    骡马的鬃尾是制造箩筛底布，毛呢料衣服衬料、刷子、乐器用弦、弓弦等的原料。不仅在国内用途很广，而且也是出口的重要物资之一。
    我国养牧骡马的数量很多。但农民牧民都没有剪取骡马鬃尾的习惯，他们害怕剪了鬃尾以后牲畜不好看、容易伤风或没有劲。所以畜产公司经常感到骡马鬃尾货源不足。
    中国畜产公司酒泉支公司业务员们，经常注意开辟骡马鬃尾货源问题。他们看到酒泉市粮食公司仓库的门口每天都有许多农民拉着马和骡子来交粮、卖粮、买粮或领粮加工。每天中午牲口都集到一块，俨然像一个牲口市场。于是他们就抽出几个懂得剪取鬃尾的技术人员，向农民们说明骡马的鬃尾长到一定程度后，就会逐渐脱落，若能及时剪取鬃尾出卖，不但能增加自己的收入，而且能给国家增加不少有用的物资等道理。并且说服了几个年轻的农民，示范剪了几个骡马的鬃尾卖给畜产公司。
    当农民们看到剪下的骡马鬃尾立刻能卖钱，而且骡马去掉鬃尾后更显得好看时，都消除了不敢剪鬃尾的顾虑。三、五天内，畜产公司就动员农民从三十三匹马身上剪下十二斤半马尾、十三斤九两马鬃，并且都用合理的价格收购了。现在，很多养骡马的农民牧民都要求学习剪鬃尾技术，准备自己剪。甘肃省畜产公司很重视这个组织货源的办法，并正在全省范围内推广。
