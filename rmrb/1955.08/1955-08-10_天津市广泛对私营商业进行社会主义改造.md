Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 9th: Over the past year, Tianjin's socialist transformation of private businesses has made significant progress.

Currently, out of the 46 major wholesale industries and more than 4,600 wholesale businesses in Tianjin, a portion of wholesalers in import/export, traditional Chinese medicine, and general merchandise are still undergoing transformation. About 1,000 wholesalers dealing in small items like thread, cords, and hairpins are temporarily allowed to continue operating but are subject to strengthened management. The remaining wholesalers have been largely transformed. Some have transitioned into industry or become secondary wholesalers for state-owned companies. Some industries that are unsuitable for market needs have been eliminated, and more than 7,000 employees have been trained by relevant departments and assigned to state-owned commercial departments in Tianjin, Shanxi, Hebei, and Inner Mongolia. The rest have also been appropriately resettled. Industrial products supplied by Tianjin to many regions of the country are now mainly allocated directly by state-owned commerce. The speculative activities and intermediary exploitation of private wholesalers, as in the past, are no longer possible.

Out of the 36 purely commercial industries and 11,488 private retailers in the city, 27 industries and 7,000 stores have been incorporated into the state capitalist system. Among them, retailers in 14 industries, such as cotton cloth, general merchandise, and grain, have become sales agents, distributors, and temporary sales agents/distributors for state-owned companies. Retailers in 13 industries, such as tobacco, alcohol, porcelain, and chicken/duck eggs, have established wholesale relationships with state-owned companies. The retail sales of these various forms of state capitalist stores account for more than 33 percent of the total social retail sales. In Tianjin, both in the central and peripheral areas, there are stores displaying the signs of state-owned company sales agents/distributors and private stores that purchase goods from state-owned companies and sell them at state-owned company prices. Residents can now conveniently purchase essential daily necessities at fair prices.

During the transformation of capitalist commerce, Tianjin's state-owned commercial departments expanded wholesale organizations and strengthened wholesale operations, increasing the proportion of socialist commerce (including state-owned and cooperative commerce) in wholesale business from 72 percent in 1952 to over 91 percent today. This has created conditions for transforming private wholesalers and retailers. To strengthen leadership and supervision over retailers of a state capitalist nature, state-owned commercial departments have not only expanded commodity supply to them but also established central stores for cotton cloth, general merchandise, grain, and cultural/educational supplies in various districts of the city. These central stores regularly convene business meetings for sales agents/distributors in the district to study market conditions and residents' opinions, and to exchange experiences in improving business management. Some have also helped sales agents/distributors and private business employees establish learning systems. Work is underway to gradually adjust the city's retail commercial network in a planned and step-by-step manner to gradually change the unreasonable distribution of retail stores.

### 天津市广泛对私营商业进行社会主义改造

    天津市广泛对私营商业进行社会主义改造
    新华社天津九日电　一年多以来，天津市私营商业的社会主义改造工作已有很大进展。
    现在，天津全市四十六个主要批发行业、四千六百多户批发商，除一部分进出口、国药、杂货行业的批发商正在改造和一千多户经营线绳、发卡子等零星商品的批发商目前暂时让其继续经营并对其加强管理外，其余批发商都已大体改造完毕。其中，一部分已转入工业或变为国营公司的二级批发；一部分不适合市场需要的行业已被淘汰，从业人员经过有关部门训练，已有七千多人被分配到天津市和山西省、河北省、内蒙古自治区等地国营商业部门工作，其余的也已适当安置。天津市供应全国许多地区的工业品，现在已主要由国营商业直接调拨，私营批发商如过去那样的投机倒把和在生产者、消费者之间进行中间剥削的行为已不可能。
    全市纯商业三十六个行业、私营零售商一万一千四百八十八户，已有二十七个行业、七千户商店分别纳入国家资本主义轨道。其中棉布、百货、粮食等十四个行业的零售商已成为国营公司的代销、经销店和临时代销、经销店；烟、酒、瓷器、鸡鸭卵等十三个行业的零售商和国营公司建立了批购关系。这些不同形式的国家资本主义商店的零售额，已占到社会零售总额的百分之三十三以上。在天津市内，无论是中心区还是边沿区，到处都有挂着国营公司代销、经销牌子的商店和从国营公司批购货物、按照国营公司牌价出售商品的私营商店。市民所需要的主要生活用品都能以公平价钱就近买到了。
    在对资本主义商业进行改造的过程中，天津市国营商业部门扩大了批发机构，加强了批发业务，使社会主义商业（包括国营商业、合作社营商业）在批发业务中所占的比重，由一九五二年的百分之七十二上升到现在的百分之九十一以上。这为改造私营批发商和零售商创造了条件。国营商业部门为了加强对国家资本主义性质的零售商的领导和监督，除对它们扩大商品供应以外，还在市内各区设立棉布、百货、粮食、文教用品等中心店。这些中心店经常召集区内的代销、经销商户举行业务会议，研究市场情况和居民意见，交流改进经营管理的经验。有的还帮助代销、经销店和私商从业人员建立学习制度。为逐渐改变零售商店分布不合理的状况，有计划地逐步地调整全市零售商业网的工作正在进行中。
