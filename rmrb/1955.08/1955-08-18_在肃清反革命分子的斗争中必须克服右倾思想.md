    Right-leaning Thought Must Be Overcome in the Struggle to Purge Counter-Revolutionaries
    Shi Xin
    The struggle to purge the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all hidden counter-revolutionaries is gradually unfolding nationwide. Through this struggle, not only has the revolutionary vigilance and enthusiasm for safeguarding socialist construction of the people been greatly enhanced, but also many of us have learned to distinguish between good people and bad people, especially those bad people who outwardly support the revolution but are actually against it. On this basis, a large number of hidden counter-revolutionaries have been uncovered in various places. However, a considerable number of hidden counter-revolutionaries have not yet been exposed and eliminated. At the same time, our enemies are doing everything possible to resist and sabotage this struggle. They are not only adopting more cunning methods to conceal their true colors, attempting to muddle through, but also creating rumors, writing threatening letters, posting reactionary slogans, and even committing murder, openly undermining this struggle. All this shows that this struggle is long-term, complex, and arduous. We must carry out this struggle more widely and deeply. If we do not purge all counter-revolutionaries, the counter-revolutionaries will harm us.

    However, in the current struggle, some people in our ranks underestimate the enemy's situation and do not pay enough attention or even pay very little attention to this political struggle of great significance. They have varying degrees of right-leaning thought. This right-leaning thought hinders the further development of the struggle, and this should be resolutely overcome.

    Some comrades only care about their professional work and do not care about politics. They use the excuse of "being busy with work and unable to take care of it," do not participate in the struggle to purge counter-revolutionaries, and shirk their leadership responsibility for the struggle to purge counter-revolutionaries. When they cannot shirk their responsibility, although they nominally participate in the leadership of the struggle, they do not actually conduct real leadership. They do not understand the situation, do not study the situation, and are clueless about the problems existing in their units and regions. Comrade Zhang Haomin, Deputy Director of the Institute of Industrial and Mining of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry, once regarded leading this struggle as a "trouble," believing that "these things should not delay other work and meetings." Comrade Gong Shaoying, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the People's Education Publishing House, even proposed at the beginning of the struggle: "If I am asked to lead the compilation of history textbooks, I will desperately try to complete the task; if I am asked to lead this movement, I will lie down." It cannot be denied that the tasks on our various fronts are currently heavy, and the work of many of our leading staff is intense. It also cannot be denied that to carry out this struggle, we need to devote time and effort, which will not have no impact on the current professional work. But anyone who thinks that professional work can be done well without purging hidden counter-revolutionaries is completely wrong. You must know that counter-revolutionaries will not relax their sabotage against us just because we are busy with our professional work. If you don't bother to deal with them, they can bother to deal with you. The counter-revolutionary Sun Yishan seized the position of chief engineer of the Dalian Paint Factory and used his technology and authority to carry out a series of sabotage activities, which resulted in the factory failing to complete the trial production of new products and the national emergency orders for two consecutive years. May I ask, if we do not eliminate hidden counter-revolutionaries, what guarantee do we have to do our professional work well? In order to carry out the struggle to purge counter-revolutionaries well, we should make appropriate arrangements for the current work and struggle, distinguish the priorities of the current work, and postpone or not do the less important professional work. Doing so is precisely for the long-term interests of our professional work and for the greatest interests of the people of the whole country.

    Some comrades always assume: "Counter-revolutionaries exist elsewhere, but not here with us." Of course, we cannot blindly exaggerate the enemy's strength and affirm that every agency and every department has counter-revolutionaries before the investigation is clear. But before the investigation is clear, we cannot be blindly optimistic and affirm that our agency and department has no hidden counter-revolutionaries. Current facts prove that the enemy has indeed infiltrated many agencies and many departments. Before the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was exposed, many people in literary and art circles once thought that literary and art circles were "pen-pushing intellectuals" and there would be no counter-revolutionaries. Facts refuted this statement. After the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was exposed, many people thought that Hu Feng elements existed in literary and art circles, but not elsewhere. Facts also refuted this statement. Now we hear similar statements again. For example, some comrades in public security, military, confidential, and national defense industry departments say: "Our departments are vital departments, and security work is very strict. Counter-revolutionaries cannot infiltrate." But the more vital our departments are, the more counter-revolutionaries will try to infiltrate them; and if a vital department has a counter-revolutionary, his harm will be particularly serious. Since the counter-revolutionary Yang Fan was able to infiltrate the public security department and seize the important position of Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, why can't other counter-revolutionaries infiltrate our other vital departments? In fact, many vital departments have uncovered counter-revolutionaries. Some comrades in some departments say: "Everyone here is a Party member or a League member, and the problem is simple." But are the counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League still few in number? Some key members of the Hu Feng clique, as well as the counter-revolutionary political rogue Li Wanming, once fraudulently obtained the title of Communist Party member, isn't that a fact?

    Some comrades are also restrained in leading this struggle, and dare not let go of mobilizing the masses. Whenever they mention mobilizing the masses, they first think of certain deviations that occurred in the past rectification movement and the "Three-Anti" movement. They either emphasize preventing deviations without relying on and mobilizing the masses, so that the struggle in these units is weak and powerless, the fighting ranks of the masses have not been formed, and the arrogance of counter-revolutionaries is very rampant; or when the masses have just been mobilized, they do not continue to correctly lead the masses to deepen the struggle, but are restrained and pour cold water on the masses. This practice of fearing to mobilize the masses is completely wrong. It should be seen that the past rectification, "Three-Anti" and other movements were able to achieve great results precisely because the masses were fully mobilized. It is unthinkable to achieve the victory of these movements without fully mobilizing the masses. Although individual and temporary deviations have occurred in these movements, this is not because mobilizing the masses was wrong, but because some leading comrades did not correctly implement the central government's policies and guidelines in the movement, and did not correctly lead the masses. In the current struggle, we should learn from the experiences and lessons of past mass movements, and the first thing we should learn is the most valuable experience of fully mobilizing the masses, and at the same time strictly abide by the guidelines instructed by the Party Central Committee to carry out work, and implement correct leadership over the masses. We cannot give up eating because of choking, see individual deviations in past movements, and bind our hands and feet, and not mobilize the masses to fight against hidden counter-revolutionaries. Relying on the masses to fight against counter-revolutionaries is one of the glorious traditions of our Party, and it is also the guarantee for the victory of the struggle. Fighting against hidden enemies requires even more reliance on the masses, and requires millions of eyes to monitor the enemy. As long as the broad masses are vigilant and mobilized, and closely cooperate with the work of specialized organs, any counter-revolutionary will not escape the people's net, and any cunning and hidden enemy will be exposed to the light of day. After studying the materials on the Hu Feng incident, the comrades of the Ministry of Foreign Trade greatly improved their awareness and enthusiasm, and found three spies based on investigation and research. The Shanxi Fujiatan Coal Mine recently conducted a struggle against sabotage accidents. After the masses reported and exposed and the work team investigated and verified, they also found eight hidden counter-revolutionaries and other criminals. These are all good proofs.

    It should also be mentioned that some comrades in this struggle shout slogans of raising vigilance, but in reality they have not raised vigilance. Although these comrades have been "greatly surprised" more than once in the struggle, they have not woken up from the "great surprise." They either did not use the experiences and lessons learned from this study and struggle as weapons to check the past work and find the existing loopholes and problems; or they did not closely link the current study and struggle with improving work, while studying and struggling, they improved their work in time, so that counter-revolutionaries would not have any chance to take advantage of it. One central agency found two cases of counter-revolutionaries cutting off wires to plot murder in the learning process, but they did not immediately use these two cases to educate all staff members in order to improve the vigilance and fighting enthusiasm of the masses. After checking the shortcomings of the lax confidentiality system, this agency still sent confidential documents to general correspondents for delivery. In 1954, the Public Security Bureau of a city in Jiangsu Province had as many as 44 incidents of losing confidential documents, publications, and public security materials, but this unit once again had serious leakage incidents in this struggle to purge hidden counter-revolutionaries, throwing a batch of confidential documents and public security materials into the outside trash can as waste paper. Obviously, such a phenomenon of shouting slogans of raising vigilance but actually remaining numb should be resolutely opposed. We cannot investigate which secrets the enemy stole on the one hand, and send the secrets to the enemy with both hands on the other. We cannot remove hidden counter-revolutionaries from the front door and let counter-revolutionaries sneak in from the back door.

    In the struggle to purge all hidden counter-revolutionaries, various right-leaning thoughts must be overcome. Stalin once said that our people "in this environment where they have achieved huge and important victories in socialist construction, will produce a mood of self-praise, a mood of showing off victories, a mood of underestimating the strength of the enemy, a mood of overestimating their own strength, and because of all this, political blindness will appear." Precisely because our victories and achievements will become greater and greater, we need to check and constantly overcome the right-leaning thought of paralysis and underestimation of the enemy at all times.

    The struggle to purge counter-revolutionaries is very sharp and very complex. We must have a full understanding of the situation of this struggle, must continue to eliminate right-leaning thoughts, further raise vigilance, take out the greatest courage and determination, carry out the struggle to purge counter-revolutionaries more widely and deeply, and resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely purge all counter-revolutionaries!

    在肃清反革命分子的斗争中必须克服右倾思想
    湜辛
    肃清胡风反革命集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子的斗争，正在全国范围内逐步展开。通过这个斗争，不仅大大提高了人民群众的革命警惕性和保卫社会主义建设的积极性，而且使得我们很多的人学会了辨别好人和坏人，特别是辨别那些表面上拥护革命而实际上反对革命的坏人。在这个基础上，各地已经查出了一大批暗藏的反革命分子。但是，还有相当多的暗藏的反革命分子没有被揭露和清除。同时我们的敌人正在千方百计地抵抗和破坏这个斗争。他们不只是采取更加狡猾的办法将自己的真象隐蔽起来，企图蒙混过关；而且制造谣言、写恐吓信、贴反动标语，甚至行凶杀人，公然破坏这个斗争。这些都说明这场斗争是长期的、复杂的、艰巨的。我们必须把这个斗争更广泛、更深入地开展起来。我们不肃清一切反革命分子，反革命分子就要危害我们。
    但是在当前的斗争中，在我们的队伍中还有一部分人对敌情估计不足，对这个具有重大意义的政治斗争不够重视甚至很不重视。他们有着不同程度的右倾思想。这种右倾思想阻碍着斗争的进一步开展，这是应当坚决加以克服的。
    有一些同志只顾业务，不问政治。他们借口“业务忙，顾不上”，不参加肃清反革命分子的斗争，推卸对肃清反革命分子的斗争的领导责任。当无法推卸责任时，他们虽然也在名义上参加了对斗争的领导，实际上并没有进行真正的领导。他们不了解情况、不研究情况，对本单位本地区存在的问题心中无数。山西省工业厅工矿研究所副所长张浩敏同志就曾把领导这个斗争看成“麻烦”，认为“不能因这些事情耽误别的工作和会议”。人民教育出版社副总编辑巩绍英同志在斗争开始时甚至提出：“要我领导搞历史课本，我拚命也要完成任务；若要我领导这个运动，我就要躺倒。”不能否认，目前我们各个战线上的任务是繁重的，我们许多领导工作人员的工作是紧张的。也不能否认，要开展这个斗争就需要拿出时间拿出力量，这对眼前的业务工作也不是丝毫没有影响的。但是谁要是以为不肃清暗藏的反革命分子也可以照样搞好业务，那就完全错了。要知道反革命分子并不因为我们业务忙而放松对我们的破坏。你顾不上去整他，他可顾得上整你。反革命分子孙移山窃踞了大连油漆厂主任工程师的职位，利用技术和职权进行了一连串的暗害勾当，使得这个厂连续两年没有完成新产品试制和国家紧急订货的任务。试问，我们不去清除暗藏的反革命分子，我们要搞好业务究竟有什么保证呢？为了很好地开展肃清反革命分子的斗争，我们应该对当前的工作和斗争加以适当安排，分清当前工作的轻重缓急，把比较次要的业务工作缓办或不办。这样做正是为了我们业务的长远利益，为了全国人民的最大利益。
    有一些同志总是设想：“反革命分子在别处有，在我们这里是没有的。”当然，我们不能盲目地夸大敌人的力量，在没有查清以前就肯定每一个机关每一个部门都有反革命分子。但是在没有查清以前，也不能盲目乐观，就肯定自己这个机关这个部门就没有暗藏的反革命分子。目前若干事实证明，敌人确实已经钻进了很多机关很多部门。在胡风反革命集团被揭露以前，文艺界的许多人曾经认为文艺界是“摇笔杆子的文人”，不会有什么反革命分子。事实反驳了这种说法。在胡风反革命集团被揭露以后，又有许多人认为胡风分子文艺界有，别的地方没有。事实也反驳了这种说法。现在我们又听到诸如此类的说法。例如，有些公安、军事、机要、国防工业部门的同志说：“我们这里是要害部门，保卫工作十分严密，反革命分子钻不进来。”可是越是我们的要害部门，反革命分子就越要想方设法往里面钻；而要害部门有了一个反革命分子，他的危害也就特别严重。既然反革命分子杨帆能够钻进公安部门，而且窃取了上海市公安局长这样的重要职位，别的反革命分子为什么不可能钻进我们的其他要害部门呢？实际上许多要害部门都已查出了反革命分子。有些部门的同志说：“我们这里不是党员就是团员，问题简单。”但是现在混进了共产党和青年团内的反革命分子难道还在少数吗？一些胡风集团的骨干分子，以及反革命政治流氓李万铭，都曾骗取了共产党员的称号，难道不是事实吗？
    也有一些同志在领导这个斗争中束手束脚，不敢放手发动群众。一提到发动群众，他们首先想到的就是过去整风运动和“三反”运动中所产生的某些偏差。他们或者强调防止偏差而不去依靠和动员群众，以致这些单位的斗争软弱无力，群众的战斗队伍没有组成，反革命分子的气焰却很嚣张；或者当群众刚刚发动起来，不去继续正确地领导群众深入斗争，而是束手束脚，给群众泼冷水。这种害怕发动群众的做法是完全错误的。应当看到，过去的整风、“三反”等运动所以能取得伟大的成绩，正是因为充分发动了群众的结果。不充分发动群众，要取得这些运动的胜利是不可设想的。在这些运动中虽然也曾经出现过个别的、暂时的偏差，但这并不是因为发动群众错了，而是因为某些领导同志在运动中没有正确地执行中央的方针政策，没有正确地领导群众。我们在当前的斗争中是要吸取过去群众运动中的经验教训，我们首先应当吸取的就是充分发动群众这条最宝贵的经验，同时要严格遵照党中央所指示的方针去进行工作，对群众实行正确的领导。我们不能因噎废食，看到过去运动中的个别偏差，便把自己的手脚束缚起来，不去发动群众进行对暗藏的反革命分子的斗争。依靠群众同反革命分子作斗争，是我们党的光荣传统之一，也是斗争取得胜利的保证。同暗藏的敌人作斗争，就更加需要依靠群众，需要有千百万双眼睛去监视敌人。只要广大群众警惕起来和动员起来，同专门机关的工作密切配合，任何反革命分子也将逃不出人民的天罗地网，任何狡猾的隐蔽的敌人也将暴露于光天化日之下。对外贸易部的同志，学习了关于胡风事件的材料后，觉悟性和积极性大为提高，在调查研究的基础上就查出了三个特务。山西富家滩煤矿最近进行了一次反破坏事故的斗争，经过广大职工的检举揭发和工作组的调查对证，也查出了八个暗藏的反革命分子及其他犯罪分子。这些都是很好的证明。
    还应当提到有些同志在这个斗争中空喊提高警惕，而实际上并没有提高警惕。这些同志在斗争中虽然不止一次地“大吃一惊”，但是他们并没有从“大吃一惊”中清醒过来。他们或者没有把这次学习和斗争中得到的经验教训当作武器，去检查过去的工作，发现存在的漏洞和问题；或者不把当前的学习和斗争同改进工作密切地联系起来，一面学习和斗争，一面及时地改进工作，不使反革命分子再有任何可乘之隙。有一个中央机关在学习过程中发现了两起反革命分子割断电线阴谋杀人的事件，他们都并没有立即利用这两个事件向全体工作人员进行教育，借以提高群众的警惕性和斗争积极性。这个机关在检查了保密制度不严的缺点之后，仍然将机密文件交由一般的通讯员递送。江苏有一个市公安局在一九五四年曾经发生遗失机密文件、刊物和公安材料等事件四十四起之多，可是这个单位在这次肃清暗藏的反革命分子的斗争中竟然又发生严重的失密事件，将一批机密文件和公安材料当作废纸倒在外面的垃圾箱中。显然，像这样空喊提高警惕，实际上麻痹如故的现象是应当坚决反对的。我们不能一面追查敌人偷窃了哪些机密，一面又用双手把机密送给敌人。我们也不能从前门把暗藏的反革命分子清除出去，又让反革命分子从后门混进来。
    在肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子的斗争中，必须克服各种右倾思想。斯大林曾经说过，我们的人“在社会主义建设方面获得了巨大和重要的胜利的这种环境中，会产生自夸的情绪、炫耀胜利的情绪，会产生对敌人力量估计不足的情绪、过高估计自己力量的情绪，而且由于这一切，就出现了政治上的盲目”。正因为我们的胜利和成绩将越来越大，我们就需要时时检查和不断克服麻痹轻敌的右倾思想。
    肃清反革命分子的斗争是十分尖锐十分复杂的。我们对这个斗争的形势必须有充分的认识，必须继续清除右倾思想，更加提高警觉，拿出最大的勇气和决心，更广泛更深入地开展肃清反革命分子的斗争，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地肃清一切反革命分子！
