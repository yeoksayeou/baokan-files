    Gansu Provincial People's Committee Holds Enlarged Meeting
    Discusses the Struggle to Eliminate All Counter-Revolutionary Elements
    The Gansu Provincial People's Committee held an enlarged administrative meeting on August 3 to discuss the issue of launching a struggle to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements. Liu Lantao, Director of the Public Security Bureau, delivered a report at the meeting. The report stated: A considerable number of counter-revolutionary elements have infiltrated many places and departments in Gansu. After infiltrating the revolutionary ranks, these counter-revolutionary elements seized various opportunities and adopted the most covert and insidious methods to steal state secrets, create rumors, sabotage production, and carry out counter-revolutionary activities such as assassinations and poisoning. On the evening of June 27, the wheat harvested on 59 mu of land in the Fourth Township Agricultural Production Cooperative of Gonghe District, Zhengning County, was burned by counter-revolutionary elements. He Fuan, a reactionary element in Linxia County, resisted the unified purchase and sale policy and hated his family's education of him, and on May 7, he killed his mother, son, and wife. The report pointed out that in order to smoothly carry out this struggle, it is necessary to resolutely oppose and overcome right-leaning ideas of numbness and indifference to the activities of counter-revolutionary elements. Liberalism, individualism, telling lies in politics, spreading rumors, and undermining institutional rules are all breeding grounds for counter-revolutionary elements to carry out activities, and it is also necessary to educate agency staff to overcome them. As long as the vigilance of the vast number of agency staff and the masses is raised, and they cooperate with the leading organs and specialized organs to pay attention to and monitor the enemy's activities, any cunning enemy will be exposed.
    In addition to the members of the Provincial People's Committee, members of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, heads of various work departments of the Provincial People's Committee, and heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations attended the meeting. Many people at the meeting expressed their intention to seriously study relevant documents, explain policies to the masses, and mobilize the masses in order to resolutely, thoroughly, and cleanly eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements.

    甘肃省人民委员会举行扩大会议
    讨论关于肃清一切反革命分子斗争问题
    甘肃省人民委员会于八月三日举行扩大行政会议，讨论关于开展肃清一切暗藏反革命分子斗争的问题。公安厅长刘兰亭在会上作了报告。报告说明：在甘肃很多地方、很多部门都混入了相当数量的反革命分子，这些反革命分子混入革命阵营内部以后，就利用各种机会，采用最隐蔽最阴险的方式，窃取国家机密，制造谣言，破坏生产，以及进行暗杀、放毒等反革命活动。正宁县宫河区四乡农业生产合作社在六月二十七日晚被反革命分子放火烧毁五十九亩地内收获的麦子。临夏县反动分子何福安因抗拒统购统销并仇视家人对他的教育，在五月七日竟杀死其母、子、妻三人。报告指出：为了顺利开展这一斗争，必须坚决反对和克服对反革命分子活动的麻木不仁的右倾思想。自由主义、个人主义、在政治上说假话，小广播、破坏机关制度等都是反革命分子进行活动的温床，也必须教育机关工作人员加以克服。只要广大机关工作人员、群众的警惕性提高，并且配合领导机关和专门机关去注意和监视敌人的活动，任何狡猾的敌人都会被揭发出来。
    出席会议的除省人民委员会委员以外，还有政协甘肃省委员会委员、省人民委员会各工作部门以及各民主党派和人民团体的负责人等。许多人在会上表示要认真学习有关文件，向群众讲解政策，发动群众，以便坚决、彻底、干净地肃清一切反革命分子。
