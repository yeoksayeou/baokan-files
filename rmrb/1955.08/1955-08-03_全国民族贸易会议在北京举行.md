Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd. The Ministry of Commerce and the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China jointly convened the National Ethnic Trade Conference in Beijing from June 27th to July 11th. Representatives from state-owned commercial departments and ethnic affairs departments in thirteen ethnic regions, including Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, and Yunnan, attended the meeting.

During the conference, representatives from various regions reported in detail on the market conditions in ethnic areas, summarized the work experience of the past few years, proposed solutions on how to overcome the generalization of commodity supply in ethnic areas, and put forward specific opinions on how to formulate ethnic trade policies based on the characteristics and needs of different ethnic groups in the future.

Ethnic trade work has developed greatly in recent years. State-owned commercial institutions have been established in ethnic areas, mastering wholesale business and becoming the leading force in the market. According to incomplete statistics from 1954, there were more than 2,300 state-owned commercial institutions and mobile trade groups in ethnic areas across the country, with more than 44,000 trade cadres, including more than 10,000 cadres from ethnic minorities. State-owned commerce has greatly strengthened purchasing and supply operations to meet the growing needs of all ethnic groups. In 1954, the total sales value of state-owned commerce in ethnic areas increased by 4.7 times compared with 1951, and the total purchase value increased by 5.1 times compared with 1951. State-owned commerce also implemented a fair and reasonable price policy, which increased the historically low prices of agricultural, pastoral, and special local products, and reduced the prices of many industrial products. In ethnic areas with relatively backward economies, it also helped to establish and develop some economic centers and primary markets. The representatives pointed out that through trade activities, the economy of the minority areas and the national economy have been linked together, giving full play to the role of mutual support between industry, agriculture and animal husbandry, enabling the minority people to appreciate the party and the government's national policies from the actual economic benefits, and enhance national unity. After studying and discussing the characteristics and needs of ethnic areas, the representatives believed that the situations in ethnic areas across the country are very different. For example, some ethnic areas have completed land reform, and agricultural and pastoral production has reached or exceeded the level before liberation, and socialist commerce has basically occupied the rural and pastoral markets; some ethnic areas have not yet carried out land reform, economic development is relatively backward, the market is underdeveloped, and the foundation of state-owned commerce is weak; and some ethnic areas, such as the Tibetan areas, have even more different situations. Based on these different characteristics and specific circumstances, the national ethnic areas are divided into several different types, and ethnic trade policies are formulated separately in terms of commercial organization and commodity circulation, stipulating the steps forward and working methods. Ethnic trade work is suitable for the specific circumstances of the time and place and the needs of all ethnic groups, so that the progress of socialist transformation can conform to the specific circumstances of all ethnic groups. The representatives pointed out that in order to effectively overcome the generalization in commodity management, the commercial departments in ethnic areas should, according to the needs of the people of all ethnic groups and all classes in the local area, first organize the local or neighboring local industrial and handicraft departments to process and order these commodities; if they cannot be produced in the local or neighboring areas, they should sign contracts with the wholesale stations in major cities for production and supply. For some commodities necessary for the lives of ethnic minorities, it is necessary to meet the needs as much as possible; at the same time, it is necessary to introduce and use commodities that meet the needs of ethnic minorities in a planned way. In terms of procurement, it is necessary to actively expand the procurement of marketable local specialties, improve specifications and quality, and pay attention to discovering new sources of goods and expand the variety of procurements.

    全国民族贸易会议在北京举行
    新华社二日讯　中华人民共和国商业部、民族事务委员会从六月二十七日到七月十一日，在京联合召开全国民族贸易会议。西藏、新疆、内蒙、青海、云南等十三个民族地区的国营商业部门和民族事务部门的代表参加了这个会议。
    会议期间，各地代表详细汇报了民族地区市场情况，总结了几年来的工作经验，对如何克服民族地区商品供应的一般化问题提出了解决的办法，并特别就今后如何根据不同民族的特点和需要分别制定民族贸易政策问题，提出了具体的意见。
    民族贸易工作几年来已有很大的发展。民族地区已普遍建立国营商业机构，掌握了批发业务，成为市场的领导力量。据一九五四年不完全材料统计，全国民族地区已有二千三百多个国营商业机构和流动贸易小组，拥有四万四千多名贸易干部，其中少数民族干部一万多人。国营商业大大加强了收购和供应业务，来满足各族人民日益增长的需要。一九五四年民族地区国营商业销售总值比一九五一年增加了四点七倍，收购总值比一九五一年增加了五点一倍。国营商业并执行公平合理的价格政策，使历史上偏低的农、牧、土特产品价格提高了，许多工业品的价格降低；在经济比较落后的民族地区，还帮助建立和发展了一些经济中心和初级市场。代表们指出，通过贸易活动，少数民族地区经济和全国经济已经联结起来，发挥了工、农、牧业相互支援的作用，使少数民族人民从实际经济利益上体会到党和政府的民族政策，增进了民族团结。各地代表在研究讨论了民族地区的特点和需要后，认为全国民族地区情况很不相同。例如有的民族地区已完成了土地改革，农牧业生产已达到或超过解放前水平，社会主义商业已基本上占领了农村及牧区市场；有的民族地区土地改革尚没有进行，经济发展比较落后，市场不发达，国营商业基础薄弱；还有一些民族地区如藏族地区的情况更有不同。根据这些各不相同的特点和具体情况，将全国民族地区划分为几种不同类型，在商业组织机构和商品流通等方面，分别制定民族贸易政策，规定前进步骤和工作办法。民族贸易工作适合于当时当地的具体情况和各族人民的需要，才能使社会主义改造的进度符合于各民族的具体情况。代表们指出，为了有效地克服商品经营上的一般化，民族地区商业部门应根据当地各民族、各阶层人民的需要，先向当地或邻近地区的地方工业和手工业部门组织对这些商品的加工订货；在当地或邻近地区不能生产时再和各大城市的批发站签订合同，进行生产供应。对于一部分少数民族生活上所必需的商品，要尽可能满足需要；同时对合乎少数民族需要的商品，要有计划地介绍使用。在收购上，要积极扩大有销路的土特产的收购工作，改进规格质量，并注意发现新货源，扩大收购品种。
