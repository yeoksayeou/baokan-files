Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 5th. The People's Republic of China government delegation, headed by Vice Premier He Long, left Warsaw by plane on the 4th to return home after attending the Polish National Day celebrations and visiting various parts of Poland.

Those who saw them off at the airport included Polish Council of Ministers First Vice Chairman Nowak, Vice Chairmen Jozwiak-Witold and Indrikhov, Foreign Minister Skrzeszewski, State Economic Planning Commission Vice Chairman Lesz, Shipping Minister Pobiel, and more than 200 representatives from all walks of life in Warsaw.

The Korean Ambassador to Poland, Heo Kuk-bong, the head of the Chinese youth delegation participating in the festival, Luo Yi, and personnel from the Chinese Embassy in Poland also saw them off at the airport.

Chinese and Polish national flags fluttered at the airport, and the national anthems of the two countries were played.

Before boarding the plane, Vice Premier He Long inspected the guard of honor and made a speech as follows: Dear comrades and friends!

The government delegation of the People's Republic of China is about to leave your beautiful capital - the heroic city of Warsaw. During our stay in Poland, we have been warmly welcomed and cordially received by the Polish government and people. Please allow me to express our heartfelt thanks on behalf of the Chinese delegation.

In celebrating the grand Polish Rebirth Day with the fraternal Polish people, and in visiting various places, we have personally witnessed the glorious achievements made by the Polish people in the cause of socialist construction under the correct leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union over the past eleven years; we have seen the selfless labor enthusiasm of the Polish people and the significant improvement in the material and cultural living standards of the people; we have seen the Polish people's love for their motherland and their strong will to safeguard world peace. All this has left an indelible impression on us and encouraged the Chinese people who are engaged in socialist industrialization. The Chinese people should learn from the Polish people.

Dear comrades and friends! As we bid farewell to you, please allow me to once again express my heartfelt congratulations on your great achievements in construction. I sincerely wish the Polish people new, greater, and more glorious achievements in the cause of building socialism and safeguarding peace.

Long live the Polish People's Republic!

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Polish people!

Long live the powerful socialist camp of peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union!

    我国政府代表团离华沙回国
    新华社华沙五日电　以贺龙副总理为首的中华人民共和国政府代表团，在参加了波兰国庆典礼和到波兰各地参观访问以后，于四日乘飞机离华沙返国。
    到机场送行的有波兰部长会议第一副主席诺瓦克，副主席约兹维亚克—韦托德和英德里霍夫斯基，外交部长斯克热歇夫斯基，国家经济计划委员会副主席莱什，航运部长波比尔等以及华沙各界代表二百多人。
    朝鲜驻波兰大使许国凤，参加联欢节的中国青年代表团团长罗毅和中国驻波大使馆人员也到机场送行。
    机场上飘扬着中波两国国旗，奏着中波两国国歌。
    贺龙副总理在上飞机之前，检阅了仪仗队并发表谈话如下：亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    中华人民共和国政府代表团就要离开你们美丽的首都——英雄的城市华沙了。我们在逗留波兰期间，受到了波兰政府和人民的热烈欢迎和殷勤招待，请允许我代表中国代表团在此表示衷心的谢意。
    在和兄弟的波兰人民一起欢庆盛大的波兰复兴节中，在各地参观访问中，我们亲眼看到了波兰人民十一年来在波兰统一工人党的正确领导下，在苏联无私的援助下，在社会主义建设事业中所获得的光辉成就；看到了波兰人民忘我的劳动热情和人民物质文化生活水平的显著提高；看到了波兰人民对自己祖国的热爱和维护世界和平的坚强意志。这一切都给我们留下了不可磨灭的印象，鼓舞了正在进行社会主义工业化的中国人民。中国人民应该向波兰人民学习。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！在我们向你们告别的时候，请允许我再一次对你们建设的巨大成就表示衷心的祝贺。谨祝波兰人民在建设社会主义和维护和平的事业中取得新的、更伟大、更光辉的成就。
    波兰人民共和国万岁！
    中波两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的强大的和平民主社会主义阵营万岁！
