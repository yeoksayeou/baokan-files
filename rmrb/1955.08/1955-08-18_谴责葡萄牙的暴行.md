    Condemn Portugal's Atrocities

    In the latter half of the twentieth century, the days of colonialists running rampant in Asia should be over. However, not only do the Portuguese colonialists continue to occupy Goa, Indian territory, on land that already belongs to independent and free India, but they have also adopted extremely brutal means of suppressing the Goan people and the Indian people's struggle for the liberation of Goa. On August 15, the Portuguese authorities in Goa even used armed forces against unarmed Indian volunteers entering Goa. According to the preliminary statistics announced by Prime Minister Nehru on August 16, fifteen people died and twenty-eight were injured. This barbaric act by the Portuguese colonialists cannot but arouse great indignation among the Chinese people, the Asian people, and all righteous people in the world.

    Goa is an inseparable part of India. The Indian people cannot tolerate the continued existence of foreign colonies on Indian territory, and the Goan people especially cannot tolerate the rule of foreign colonialists. They demand the liberation of Goa and the merger of Goa with India. This is a struggle of the Indian people and the Goan people to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to safeguard their national rights. This struggle is just. The Indian people, in support of the Goan people's struggle, have sent volunteers to peacefully enter Goa to strive for the liberation of Goa. This action by Indian volunteers has received the support of all the Indian people and all peoples who love independence and freedom throughout the world. They enter Goa wave after wave, regardless of the Portuguese colonialists' brutal suppression. Their heroic and unyielding spirit is admirable.

    The Portuguese colonialists' use of force to massacre peaceful Indian people violates all standards of international behavior. After the Portuguese colonialists massacred Indian volunteers, the Portuguese Ministry of Foreign Affairs brazenly issued a so-called "protest" to the Indian government, insisting that the Indian volunteers had "invaded" Portugal's so-called "sovereignty," and claiming that their massacre of Indian volunteers was an act of "using violence to deal with violence." The Portuguese government's colonialist face of turning black into white and acting arbitrarily and violently is fully exposed here. They should be condemned by all righteous people.

    The Portuguese authorities' brutal acts have aroused widespread anger and protest among the Indian people and people from all walks of life in India. Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech in the People's Chamber of the Indian Parliament on August 16, condemning the Portuguese colonialists' brutal acts. Prime Minister Nehru also said: "This is not the end of the matter. Other things have happened and may happen. This will continue until the goal is achieved."

    The Chinese people fully support the just position and struggle of the Indian government and people. Just struggles are bound to be victorious. Goa must be returned to India.

    谴责葡萄牙的暴行
    在二十世纪下半期的今天，殖民主义者在亚洲横行霸道的日子应该结束了。但是，葡萄牙殖民者不但在已经取得独立、自由的印度的土地上，继续占领着印度的领土果阿，而且对果阿人民和印度人民争取解放果阿的斗争，采取了极其残暴的镇压手段。八月十五日，果阿的葡萄牙当局竟然以武装力量对付进入果阿的手无寸铁的印度志愿人员。根据八月十六日尼赫鲁总理所宣布的初步统计的数字，死亡十五人，受伤二十八人。葡萄牙殖民者的这种野蛮行为，不能不引起中国人民、亚洲人民以及全世界正义人类的重大愤慨。
    果阿是印度的不可分割的一部分。印度人民不能容忍在印度的领土上继续保留着外国殖民地，果阿人民尤其不能忍受外来殖民主义者的统治。他们要求解放果阿，使果阿同印度合并。这是印度人民和果阿人民为了保障国家主权和领土完整、为了保障自己的民族权利的斗争，这个斗争是正义的。印度人民为支援果阿人民的斗争，派遣志愿人员和平进入果阿，以争取果阿的解放。印度志愿人员的这种行动得到全印度人民和全世界爱好独立自由的人民的支持。他们不顾葡萄牙殖民者的残暴镇压，一批跟着一批进入果阿。他们的英勇不屈的精神是令人钦佩的。
    葡萄牙殖民者以武力来残杀和平的印度人民，是违反一切国际行为标准的。葡萄牙政府外交部在葡萄牙殖民者屠杀了印度志愿人员之后，还公然向印度政府提出所谓“抗议”，硬说是印度志愿人员“侵犯”了葡萄牙的所谓“主权”，说他们屠杀印度志愿人员的行为是“用暴力来对付暴力”。葡萄牙政府颠倒黑白、专横暴乱的殖民主义者的面孔，于此暴露无遗。他们应该受到全体正义人类的谴责。
    葡萄牙当局的残暴行为引起了印度人民和印度各阶层人士普遍的愤怒和抗议。印度总理尼赫鲁八月十六日在印度国会人民院发表演说，谴责了葡萄牙殖民者的残暴行为。尼赫鲁总理并说：“这并不是事情的结束。其他的事情已经发生，而且可能要发生。这将一直继续到达到目的为止。”
    中国人民完全支持印度政府和人民的正义立场和斗争。正义斗争是一定要胜利的。果阿必须归还印度。
