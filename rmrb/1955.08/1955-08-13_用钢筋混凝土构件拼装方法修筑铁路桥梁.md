    Using Prefabricated Reinforced Concrete Components to Construct Railway Bridges
    The Second Engineering Team of the Harbin Railway Administration recently expanded a railway bridge by using prefabricated reinforced concrete components, based on the advanced experience of Soviet railway bridge construction. The bridge was completed and opened to traffic on July 25th, with good quality.
    Using large prefabricated reinforced concrete components to assemble railway bridges is a first in China. Its advantages are that it can reduce project costs, shorten the construction period, and avoid high-altitude operations. During construction, except for the abutments and foundations at both ends, which were built on-site, the main components such as piers, crossbeams, and stringers were all prefabricated. Therefore, it reduces concrete consumption by 50% compared to the heavy-duty railway bridges built in China in the past. At the same time, because the weight of the bridge itself is reduced, the pressure on the bridge foundation is also greatly reduced, and a pile driving process can also be eliminated. The overall cost of the bridge is approximately 500,000 yuan less than that of heavy-duty bridges built in the past.

    用钢筋混凝土构件拼装方法修筑铁路桥梁
    哈尔滨铁路管理局第二工程队最近根据苏联铁路筑桥的先进经验，采用钢筋混凝土构件拼装方法，扩建了一座铁路桥梁。这座桥在七月二十五日全部建筑完成通车，质量良好。
    用大型钢筋混凝土构件拼装铁路桥梁，在中国还是第一次。它的好处是能降低工程造价，缩短工期，避免高空作业。修筑时除了两头的桥台和基础是在工地上砌筑外，桥墩、横梁、纵梁等主要构件都是预制的，因此，它比我国过去建造的重型铁路桥梁要减少百分之五十的混凝土消耗量。同时，由于桥的本身体重减轻，对桥基础的压力也大大减少，还可减少一道打桩工序。整个桥梁的工程造价，比过去建造的重型桥梁，约少用了五十多万元。
