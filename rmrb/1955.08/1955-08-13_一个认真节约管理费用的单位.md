A Unit That Earnestly Saves on Management Expenses
By our reporter Gu Weijin

　　In the first quarter of this year, the Wuhan Thermal Power Plant Preparatory Office began construction preparation work. At this time, some leading staff members discovered some wasteful phenomena in the office's administrative management. They once proposed the call to save expenses, but lacked the determination and methods. As a result, administrative management expenses exceeded the budget by 800 yuan in the first quarter. This fact aroused the attention of the leading staff. They considered: the project has not yet started, the workload is not large, and the administrative management expenses have already exceeded the budget by so much. In the future, when entering the construction phase and the workload increases, won't it exceed the budget even more? Furthermore, if administrative management expenses can exceed the budget, will the basic construction costs also exceed the budget? Wouldn't this be even more wasteful? Considering these issues, the leading staff of the office were determined to correct the overspending of administrative management expenses, so as to educate all staff members through this incident, improve their socialist consciousness, and establish a prevailing atmosphere of practicing thrift and opposing waste.

　　When the leading staff of the office mobilized everyone to save management expenses at the meeting of section-level staff, many staff members were ideologically unconvinced. Some people believed that wages account for 60 percent of administrative management expenses, and wages cannot be saved, so what else can be saved! Some people suggested that it is the preparatory period now, and there is a lot of contact with the outside world, so expenses will naturally be higher! Some people unreasonably believed that if the spending is cut too tightly, it may affect the work! Some people said behind their backs: saving is a matter for the administrative and financial departments. We are not directly related to expenses. What can we do to save?

　　According to the above ideas, the leading staff of the preparatory office studied why everyone did not pay attention to saving work, and found that there were great shortcomings in the leadership's working methods: although there was the determination to practice thrift, there was a lack of methods to promote thrift among everyone. They only made general mobilizations at the meeting, without proposing specific facts of waste to arouse everyone's vigilance, and even less proposed saving methods. Naturally, it was impossible to mobilize all the staff. Therefore, the leading staff decided to change their working methods and began to check waste phenomena based on the overspending of administrative management expenses in the first quarter, and to educate everyone with vivid facts of waste. In order to do this work well, they went to various departments to mobilize the masses and expose waste from all aspects. Through individual conversations and various meetings, many facts of waste were discovered. For example, in the first quarter, there were 23 more people than the authorized staffing, resulting in an additional expenditure of more than 3,000 yuan; according to the existing number of staff members, renting one floor of the building as an office would be sufficient, but two floors were rented, wasting 287 yuan in rent per month; due to the use of an additional office, three more telephone sets were added, wasting a total of 319 yuan in telephone charges in half a year; a dormitory was rented, originally planned to accommodate more than ten households, but only two households lived there, wasting 75 yuan in rent per month; a deputy director went to Guangzhou on official business. The matter was not urgent and he could have taken the train, but he took the plane, wasting 80 yuan in travel expenses; a diesel truck was purchased, which was not suitable for use, wasting more than 170 yuan in depreciation costs per month; other wastes included excessive use of long-distance calls and telegrams. After summarizing these waste facts, the leading staff publicized them to the staff, explaining that waste existed and that saving was possible.

　　After practical education, many people began to have heated discussions on the issue of practicing thrift and opposing waste. In the discussion, some staff members continued to expose waste from all aspects, and some staff members calculated detailed accounts based on the waste phenomena found above, realizing that if each item of waste was viewed in isolation, it was not a large amount, but if all the wastes were added together, the waste would be very large. In particular, some waste items, such as offices and dormitories, are year-round expenses. If they are calculated from a monthly or quarterly waste to a one-year or two-year waste, the amount of waste will be even greater. After calculating the detailed accounts, many staff members were greatly surprised. Some staff members said when examining their own thoughts: they used to think that saving should start from the big picture (referring to the basic construction being carried out), and the small picture (referring to administrative management) was nothing great. Now that they have calculated the accounts, they understand that if they don't pay attention to saving in small things, it will cause great waste. In order to conduct in-depth education on practicing thrift among staff members, the leading staff of the preparatory office further guided everyone to examine the causes of waste: First of all, there was insufficient understanding of the importance of practicing thrift. Some people emphasized that the work was special and that life should be more comfortable. They did not understand that carrying forward the hard-working and simple style is our virtue. Using houses is one example. It was unnecessary to use extra offices and dormitories, but some people righteously said: "Basic construction work is hard work, it doesn't matter if the houses are spacious and comfortable!" Secondly, some people regarded all kinds of waste as "small things" to excuse themselves and others, and replaced mutual supervision and inspection with unprincipled mutual forgiveness. The wasteful phenomena such as blindly purchasing diesel trucks and arbitrarily using long-distance telephones and telegrams were produced under this situation; again, it was precisely because many people regarded various waste as "small things" that they lacked planned arrangements for many tasks, resulting in unnecessary waste. In April, the preparatory office sent people to Shanghai to handle a matter. Originally, one person would have been sufficient, but due to insufficient consideration, two people were sent.

　　After examining the causes of waste, the leading staff of the preparatory office further guided everyone to discuss the methods of practicing thrift. According to the spirit of saving expenses, everyone proposed to start from two aspects to save money: on the one hand, correctly use fixed expenses, such as reducing unnecessary management personnel, withdrawing surplus offices and dormitories, reducing some unnecessary telephone sets, and lending unsuitable diesel trucks to units in need to reduce depreciation expenses, etc. On the other hand, vigorously compress non-fixed expenses, such as when traveling on business, it must be carefully considered. If the problem can be solved by letters and telegrams, there is no need to send people to reduce the number of business trips. When using long-distance telephones and telegrams, you should also pay attention. If the problem can be solved by writing letters, try not to use long-distance telephones and telegrams. According to preliminary statistics, by adopting these saving methods, at least 7,000 yuan can be saved in management expenses throughout the year.

　　Since the saving methods were discussed and formulated by all the staff, everyone felt that they had the responsibility to implement them, and naturally they would take active actions. In particular, the Party branch, the administrative director, and the administrative section used to use the entire fourth floor as offices. Now they first moved to the third floor, and some people merged into one room for office work. The area of ​​the office was greatly reduced compared to the past. These examples motivated many staff members to further explore saving potential from all aspects while implementing saving methods. Driver Zhang Gengua used his brains to save gasoline, and the gasoline consumption in May was reduced by 33 percent compared to the past. Clerk Liu Zixi used to often purchase office paper costing 22 yuan per ream for printing. Now, in order to save expenses, he ran around and asked more questions, and bought glazed paper costing 15 yuan per ream. The cost was reduced, and the paper was still as easy to use. Typist Yuan Yexian used to have her typewriter repaired by someone under contract, costing 24 yuan in repair fees every six months. Now she proposed to pay attention to the maintenance of the machine and learn to repair it herself when problems occur, saving the contract repair fee.

　　What is particularly worth mentioning is that the leading staff of the preparatory office are not satisfied with the existing achievements, and they pay attention to consolidating their work. They further mobilized various departments to formulate practical and feasible saving systems, and required the administrative section that directly manages expenses to formulate administrative management expense plans, and the financial section to formulate financial monthly revenue and expenditure plans. These measures have played a great role in controlling expenses, checking and overcoming all wasteful phenomena.

　　Now, the Wuhan Thermal Power Plant Preparatory Office's work on actively saving administrative management expenses has initially achieved results. In the second quarter, they not only stopped the overspending of administrative management expenses, but also saved more than 5,000 yuan in administrative management expenses. It seems that this number is not large, but its significance is very great: it has educated many staff members about saving, improved socialist consciousness, enhanced saving confidence, and established a prevailing atmosphere of "saving is glorious and waste is shameful." It is precisely because of this ideological foundation that the non-productive building design was recently revised smoothly according to the spirit of comprehensive saving. As a result, the cost was reduced to within the new standard, and 760,000 yuan of wealth can be saved for the country this year.

    一个认真节约管理费用的单位
    本报记者　古维进
    今年第一季度，武汉热电厂筹建处开始了施工准备工作。这时有些领导工作人员发现处里的行政管理方面有些浪费现象，曾提出节约开支的号召，却缺乏决心和办法，结果第一季度行政管理费用超支八百元。这一事实引起了领导工作人员的重视。他们考虑：现在工程尚未开工，工作量还不多，行政管理费用竟超支了这样多，将来转入施工阶段，工作量增加，不是更要超支吗？再说，行政管理费用可以超支，将来基本建设的施工费用也同样可以超支，这不是浪费的更多吗？考虑到这些问题，处的领导工作人员决心纠正行政管理费用的超支现象，以便通过这一事件教育所属工作人员，提高他们的社会主义觉悟、树立厉行节约反对浪费的风气。
    当处的领导工作人员在科级工作人员会议上，动员大家节约管理费用时，不少工作人员思想上不通。有的人认为：工资开支占行政管理费用百分之六十，而工资是不能节省的，还能节约什么呢！有的人提出：现在是筹建时期，和外面来往特别多，开支自然要大一些！有人毫无道理地认为：假如在开支方面扣得过紧，可能会影响工作！有的人则背地里说：节约是行政和财务部门的事情，我们又不直接和费用发生关系，要节约，我们能做什么呢！
    筹建处的领导工作人员，根据上述思想研究了大家为什么不重视节约工作，发现在领导工作方法上有很大缺点：虽然有了厉行节约的决心，但缺乏推动大家厉行节约的办法，只是在会议上进行一般的动员，没有提出浪费的具体事实以引起大家的警惕，更没有提出节约的办法，自然不可能把全体工作人员发动起来。于是领导工作人员决定改变工作方法，着手根据第一季度行政管理费用的超支情况，检查浪费现象，用活生生的浪费事实教育大家。为了做好这一工作，他们分头到各科室发动群众，从各方面揭发浪费现象。通过个别谈话和各种会议，发现了很多浪费的事实。例如：第一季度超过编制二十三人，多开支三千多元；根据现有的工作人员数，租一层楼作办公室就成，却租了两层楼，每月浪费租金二百八十七元；由于多用一个办公室，就增加了三部电话机，半年共浪费电话费三百十九元；租了一栋宿舍，原计划住十余户，结果只住了两户，每月浪费租金七十五元；一个副主任因公到广州去，本来事情不急坐火车就行，却坐了飞机，浪费路费八十元；购置了一部柴油大汽车，不适合使用，每月浪费折旧费一百七十多元；其他如过多地使用长途电话、电报，也浪费了一些钱。领导工作人员把这些浪费事实加以总结后，向工作人员作了宣传，说明浪费是存在的，也说明了节约是可能的。
    经过实际教育后，许多人开始对厉行节约反对浪费的问题展开热烈的讨论。在讨论中，有些工作人员继续从各方面揭发浪费现象，有些工作人员根据以上检查出来的浪费现象算细账，认识到如把每一项的浪费孤立起来看并不算多，如果把各项浪费都算在一块，浪费就很大。特别是有些浪费项目，如办公室、宿舍等，是常年要开支的，如果把它们从一月一季的浪费算到一年二年的浪费，浪费的数字就更大了。经过算细账使许多工作人员大吃一惊。有些工作人员检查自己思想时说：以前认为节约应从大处（指正在进行的基本建设）着手，小处（指行政管理方面）没有什么了不起，现在把账一算才明白，小处如果不注意节约就会造成大浪费。为了深入对工作人员进行厉行节约的教育，筹建处的领导工作人员，又引导大家检查出造成浪费的原因：首先，是对厉行节约的重要意义认识不足。有些人强调工作特殊，生活应该过得舒服些，不了解发扬艰苦朴素作风正是我们的美德。使用房子就是一个例子，多用了办公室和宿舍本来是不必要的，但是有些人却理直气壮地说：“基本建设工作艰苦点，房子住得宽敞舒服些没有什么关系！”其次，有些人把各种浪费一律当作是“小事情”，以此来原谅自己，也原谅旁人，用无原则的彼此原谅代替了彼此间的监督和检查。盲目购置柴油大汽车，随便使用长途电话、电报等浪费现象，就是在这情形下产生的；再次，正由于不少人把各种浪费当作是“小事情”，对许多工作却缺乏有计划的安排，以致造成不必要的浪费。四月间，筹建处派人到上海处理一件事情，本来一个人就行，由于考虑不周，就派了两个人去。
    检查了造成浪费的原因之后，筹建处的领导工作人员又进一步引导大家讨论厉行节约的办法。大家根据节约开支的精神，提出从两方面入手进行节约：一方面，正确使用固定开支。如裁减不必要的管理人员，退出多余的办公室和宿舍，减少一些不必要的电话机，把不适用的柴油大汽车借给需用的单位使用以减少折旧费开支等。另一方面是大力压缩非固定开支。如出差时必须经过周密考虑，如能用函电解决的问题就不必派人去以减少出差次数。使用长途电话、电报时，也要注意，如能用写信解决的问题，尽量不使用长途电话和电报。初步统计，采用这些节约办法，全年至少可以节约管理费用七千元。
    由于节约的办法是由全体工作人员讨论、制定出来的，人人都觉得自己有贯彻的责任，自然就会积极行动起来。特别是党支部、行政主任和行政科以前是使用整个四楼作办公室，现在他们首先搬到三楼，有的人合并在一个房子里办公，办公室的面积比过去大大减少了。这些事例推动许多工作人员在贯彻节约办法的同时，又进一步从各方面挖掘节约潜力。司机张耕华开动脑筋节约汽油，五月份使用汽油比过去减少了百分之三十三。事务员刘自西过去经常采购二十二元一令的办公纸来作印刷之用，现在为了节约开支就多跑多问，买了十五元一令的油光纸，费用减少了，纸张还是一样好用。打字员袁业献以前使用的打字机是请人包修，每半年要化二十四元修理费，现在她提出注意保养机子、出了毛病自己学习修理，节省了包修费。
    值得特别提出的是，筹建处的领导工作人员，并不满足于已有的成就，他们注意了巩固工作。他们进一步发动各科室订出了切实可行的节约制度，并要求直接管理费用的行政科订出了行政管理费用计划、财务科订出了财务月度收支计划。这些措施，对于控制开支，检查并克服一切浪费现象起了很大作用。
    现在，武汉热电厂筹建处积极节约行政管理费用的工作已经初步收到成效。在第二季度里，他们不仅停止了行政管理费用的超支现象，还节约了行政管理费用五千多元。看来这个数字是不大的，但是它的意义却很大：它使许多工作人员受到节约教育，提高社会主义觉悟，增强节约信心和树立起“节约光荣、浪费可耻”的风气。正是因为有了这样的思想基础，最近才顺利地根据全面节约精神修改了非生产性建筑设计，结果把造价降低到新标准以内，今年可为国家节约七十六万元的财富。
