　　We Designed Classrooms That Are Both Economical and Practical

    Since the central government put forward the requirement to lower the standards for non-productive construction, a viewpoint has emerged among some construction units and designers: the new standards are set too low, and we won't be able to build multi-story buildings in the future; even if we can build them, they may not be practical... We recently designed a classroom building, which proves that the above statement is completely unfounded.

    This classroom building has two floors. According to the project budget we compiled, the cost per square meter is 44 yuan, 9 jiao, and 6 fen. (This includes a management fee of 16.84%, a profit of 2.5%, a reserve fund of 5%, and a basement of 130 square meters, which has a higher cost.)

    The reason why the cost of this classroom building can be so low is mainly because we paid attention to the layout of the building and adopted advanced design methods.

    In the layout of the classroom building, we strive for simplicity and practicality, making the size and specifications of each room as identical as possible. In this way, we can save building materials and labor. We also used bamboo reinforcement instead of some steel reinforcement to manufacture roof beams, which also greatly reduced costs. The design of the floor slabs adopted the advanced Soviet method of pouring concrete slabs on prefabricated closely spaced small beams, which not only facilitated construction but also saved a lot of props and formwork. In the design of the roof and frame, we re-examined the roof load. For example, previously we calculated the snow load at 50 kilograms, but this time, after collective research and reference to the new snow load calculation standards, we changed it to 20 kilograms, which in our Shandong, can completely guarantee the service life of the house. At the same time, due to the reduced snow load, the wood for the frame can also be reduced accordingly, or the standard of materials can be lowered. We also used bamboo reinforcement instead of wood to make ceilings, changed the thatched mat and asphalt felt roof to reed mat and plaster with tile hanging, eliminated curved handle locks or round handle locks on general doors and installed ordinary padlocks, and used leftover wood instead of iron or copper handles on windows. All of these measures were both practical and inexpensive.

    This classroom building fully meets the learning needs of students. For example, there are ceilings upstairs and downstairs, which can not only insulate heat and cold, but also provide some sound insulation. Although the second floor uses concrete floor slabs, both upstairs and downstairs can avoid mutual interference whether in class or studying on their own. Because we have mastered the correct ratio of indoor area to window area, especially since all doors and windows are symmetrical to each other, air can naturally circulate, and the room can always maintain fresh air and sufficient light.

    With such real-world examples, what reason is there to believe that building construction cannot meet the new standards? Not only is there no reason, but our comrades who are engaged in design work feel that there is still potential to further reduce costs. Our experience is: as long as we strengthen political study, work hard to delve into our profession, break the old design standards of the past, and improve design plans and design methods in a realistic and pragmatic manner, it is entirely possible to make designs that are both economical and practical.

　　我们设计了既经济又适用的教室
　　山东省建筑工程局设计室
    自中央提出了降低非生产性建筑标准的要求后，在一些建设单位和设计人员中间，出现了这样一种论调：新标准定的太低了，今后楼房是盖不成了；即使能盖成，也不一定适用……我们最近设计了一座教室楼，证明上述说法是完全没有根据的。
    这座教室楼一共有两层，根据我们编制的工程预算，每平方公尺的造价是四十四元九角六分。（其中还包括百分之十六点八四的管理费，百分之二点五的利润，百分之五的预留金，以及造价较高的一百三十平方公尺的地下室。）
    这座教室楼的造价所以能够这样低，主要是我们注意了建筑物的平面布置和采用了先进的设计方法。
    在教室楼的平面布置上，我们力求做到简单、适用，使每个房间的大小、规格尽可能相同。这样，就可以节省建筑材料和人工。我们还用竹筋代替部分钢筋来制造屋梁，也大大地减低了造价。楼板的设计，采用了苏联先进的在预制密置小梁上捣制混凝土板的方法，既便利了施工，又可以节省大量撑木和模板。在屋面和房架的设计上，我们重新审查了屋面的荷重。如以前雪荷重我们都按五十公斤计算，这次经过大家集体研究以及参考新的雪荷重计算标准，改按二十公斤计算，这在我们山东来说，是完全可以保证房屋的使用年限的。同时，由于雪荷重减轻，房架的木料也可以相应地减少，或者降低用材标准。我们还用竹筋代替木料做天棚，将笆板油毡屋面改为苇箔灰泥挂瓦，在一般房门上取消弯把锁或圆执手锁而改装普通挂锁，改用下料木材代替窗上的铁拉手或铜拉手，这些都做到了既适用又便宜。
    这个教室楼完全适合学生的学习需要。例如，楼上楼下都有顶棚，不但可以隔热和防寒；而且可以起一些隔音作用，虽然二层楼用的是混凝土楼板，但楼上、楼下不论上课或上自习都可以做到不互相干扰。由于掌握了室内面积同窗户面积的正确比例，特别是所有门窗都是互相对称的，空气可以自然对流，室内经常可以保持新鲜的空气和充足的光线。
    有这样的现实例子，还有什么理由认为盖楼房达不到新的标准呢？不但没有，而且我们做设计工作的同志，都感到还有进一步降低造价的潜力。我们的体会是：只要加强政治学习，努力钻研业务，打破过去陈旧的设计标准，实事求是地改进设计方案和设计方法，要做出既经济又适用的设计，是完全可能的。
