    The permanent Soviet Agricultural Exhibition established in Moscow in accordance with the decision of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union reopened its various exhibition halls in June this year.
    The resolution of the January Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a concrete program for all the workers of the exhibition and a practical guide for their actions. Thousands of employees of the exhibition have strived with all their strength to ensure that every point and every part of the January Plenary Session's resolution can be reflected in the various exhibition stands and exhibits of the exhibition.
    This year's right to participate in the exhibition is determined by the scientifically based indicators stipulated by the new principles for the unit area yield of various crops and the product production rate of animal husbandry, the indicators of the highest economic benefits obtained from each hectare of agricultural land, and the maximum amount of meat, milk, wool, and other products produced per hundred hectares of cultivated land, grassland, and pasture, as well as the indicators for reducing the cost of each unit of agricultural product produced. All these indicators are specified differently according to different regions and agricultural production sectors.
    Soviet industry is the foundation of the entire socialist economic development of the Soviet state. V.I. Lenin wrote: "The only material foundation of socialism is large-scale machine industry that can also transform agriculture."
    The power of Soviet industry and the level of mechanical equipment in agriculture are displayed in the "Agricultural Mechanization and Electrification Exhibition Hall" and twelve open-air squares. Almost all samples of agricultural machines, tools, and machinery are displayed at the exhibition. Here are tractors from "C-80" to "XT3-7", various brands of combine harvesters, including the improved "Stalinets-6" combine harvester from the Rostov Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Factory, and high-efficiency machines and tools for harvesting corn, potatoes, flax, silage crops, and cotton. The entire set of mechanized operations that make up the various agricultural production sectors are displayed in the various halls and open-air squares.
    The exhibition will greatly expand and improve the exhibition of the achievements of socialist agricultural workers based on advanced agronomic science. Now, the exhibition not only introduces individual operating units—collective farms, state farms, livestock farms, machine tractor stations, not only introduces advanced workers and innovators, but also introduces entire border regions, states, and republics that achieved bumper harvests of crops in 1954, achieved high milk yields, and effectively developed animal husbandry. The Altai Border Region, Moscow State, Novosibirsk State, Kurgan State, Akmolinsk State, Semipalatinsk State, Ryazan State, and Chelyabinsk State, the Azerbaijan Republic, and the Tajik Republic have obtained the glorious right to exhibit their products at the exhibition.
    One of the most practical ways to rapidly expand grain production is to reclaim virgin and fallow land. The exhibition pays special attention to this issue. It is sufficient to point out that there are exhibition stands specially set up to introduce the reclamation of wasteland in both the Central Exhibition Hall and the "Russian Federation," "Siberia," "Kazakh Republic," "Grain," "Urals," "Agronomy," "Animal Husbandry," "Volga River Basin," "Agricultural Mechanization and Electrification," "Water Conservancy," and "Forestry" exhibition halls.
    In the "Russian Federation Exhibition Hall," there is material on the general situation of the republic's reclamation of virgin and fallow land, materials on the completion of the 1954 plan, and the experience of advanced border regions, states, and individual farms that have achieved bumper harvests on new land. The "State Farm Exhibition Hall" provides a broad description of the achievements in grain harvest and the organization of new state farms. In the "Grain Exhibition Hall" and "Agronomy Exhibition Hall," the scientific principles of agricultural technology for achieving bumper harvests on virgin land and the principles of implementing a scientific cultivation system on these lands, and the implementation of the Maltsev cultivation method on virgin land are all reflected.
    Comrade Khrushchev paid special attention to the huge potential of millions of hectares of all-fallow land at the meeting of agricultural workers in the states and autonomous republics of the non-black soil zone. The 1955 Soviet Agricultural Exhibition will showcase the experiences of advanced collective farms that have successfully used all-fallow land to achieve bumper harvests of corn and have sown autumn crops after harvesting corn.
    The exhibition pays great attention to corn, the most precious grain and feed crop. Almost ninety exhibition stands are entirely used to illustrate the agronomic technology of growing corn, while one hundred and seventy-five exhibition stands illustrate this agronomic technology together with other crops.
    Collective farms in the Latvian Republic planted corn on a large scale for the first time in 1954. The "Kompdalbība" collective farm in the Gulbene district harvested an average of 840 quintals of corn from each hectare of land. This enabled the farm to feed livestock with 336 tons of green stalks last summer and make 45% of the silage from corn in the fall. In this collective farm, Communists are the initiators of striving for a bumper harvest of corn. Leading their work is the secretary of the Communist Youth League organization, work group leader Ya. Tsitsirovskaya.
    The example of the Non-Black Soil Zone Grain Economic Research Institute and the "New Life Road" collective farm in the Kuntsevo district shows that it is possible to obtain not only bumper harvests of green stalks but also bumper harvests of corn kernels and corn cobs in Moscow State.
    The January Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out the great significance of developing animal husbandry to the national economy. This year, the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition collected a large number of materials for studying and summarizing the experiences of advanced animal husbandry workers.
    In the "Cattle" exhibition hall, the red grassland breed "Moroshka" dairy cow from the "Karaganda" state farm is exhibited. Its milk yield reaches 13,077 kilograms per year.
    The livestock farm section introduces the situation of the livestock farm of the "Nikonovsk" state farm in Moscow State, which raises black and white dairy cows, each of which produces 6,454 kilograms of milk per year; it also introduces the situation of the livestock farm of the "Gorky-II" state farm in Moscow State, where the milk yield of each dairy cow reaches 6,072 kilograms per year.
    In the "Horse Breeding" exhibition hall, twenty-five kinds of horses are exhibited, including the stallion "Zhereby" from the "Forest Virgin Land" horse farm in the Arzamas State. The highest record of this stallion's heavy haulage reaches 16,274 kilograms.
    Ensuring that livestock have a sufficient amount of refined feed, succulent feed, and coarse feed is of decisive significance for the rapid development of animal husbandry. This requires us to thoroughly improve the organization of the feed base.
    In the open space of the sowing and planting exhibition department, the two kinds of feed rotation systems of the collective farms participating in the exhibition will be exhibited in their original form: the nine-district feed rotation of the collective farms of the "Basan" machine tractor station in the Nikolaev State and the eight-district feed vegetable rotation near the livestock farm of the "Vladimir Ilyich" collective farm in the Lenin district of Moscow State.
    The new agricultural planning system is also reflected in the exhibition, which has been implemented in various collective farms and state farms this year.
    The "Hometown of Khrushchev" collective farm in the Khomutov district of Kursk State is such a demonstration farm. This collective farm has a huge multi-sector economy, using 1,778 hectares of land. In 1954, this collective farm obtained a cash income of 3.1 million rubles from its operations. The members of this collective farm decided to double the production of grain this year and complete the task of livestock product production stipulated by the January Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in two to three years. The planned cash income of this farm this year should be 4,655,000 rubles.
    The collective farms outside the exhibition also provided great help in mastering the advanced achievements of agricultural workers.
    Among these farms, the "New Life Road" collective farm in the Kuntsevo district of Moscow State should be noted—this farm has increased the milk yield of each dairy cow to 3,409 kilograms in a short period of time due to the use of corn, the "Ilyich Road" collective farm in the Volokolamsk district that has achieved a bumper harvest of flax fiber, the "Stalin" collective farm in the Lukhovitsy district, and other farms. The Central Experimental Station for Young Natural Scientists will also exhibit outside the exhibition.
    During the opening of the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition in 1955, emphasis will be placed on the propaganda of various methods of achieving bumper harvests of crops and improving the productivity of livestock products, on the widespread promotion of progressive labor methods, and on various issues of practical application of these methods.
    In 1955, millions of people, hundreds of thousands of agricultural workers will visit the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition. They will familiarize themselves here with the experiences of the best advanced workers and the best collective farms, so that after returning to their hometowns, they can adopt these experiences in actual production to quickly complete the tasks put forward by the Communist Party and the Soviet government to agricultural workers.

　　先进经验的学校
　　苏联全苏农业展览会总干事
　　苏联科学院院　士齐津
    根据苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会的决定在莫斯科建立的永久性的苏联农业展览会，今年六月重新开放了它的各个展览馆。
    苏共中央一月全会的决议是展览会全体工作者的具体纲领，是他们的行动的实际指导。展览会的好几千员工们曾以全力来争取使一月全会决议的每一点和每一部分，都能在展览会的各个展览台和展品中体现出来。
    今年参加展览会的权利，决定于各种作物的单位面积产量和畜牧业的产品生产率按照新原则规定的有科学根据的指标，决定于从每公顷农业用地上所取得的最高经济收益的指标，每一百公顷耕地、草地和牧场上所出产的最大量的肉、乳、羊毛和其他产品的指标以及降低所生产的每一单位农产品成本的指标。所有这些指标，都按地区和农业生产部门的不同而作了不同的规定。
    苏联的工业是苏维埃国家整个社会主义经济发展的基础。弗·伊·列宁写道：“社会主义的唯一物质基础，就是同时也能改造农业的大机器工业。”
    在“农业机械化和电气化展览馆”和十二个露天广场上，展示了苏联工业的威力和农业的机械装备水平。在展览会上几乎陈列着一切农业机器、工具和机械的样品。这里有从“C—80”到“XT3—7”的拖拉机，各种牌子的收割联合机，其中包括罗斯托夫农业机器制造工厂出的完善的“斯大林涅茨—6”收割联合机，收获玉蜀黍、马铃薯、亚麻、青贮饲料作物、棉花的高效率的机器和农具。在各个大厅和露天广场上展出了组成各个不同农业生产部门的整套机械化工作的全部机器。
    展览会将大大扩大并改进对社会主义农业劳动者在先进农艺科学基础上所取得的成绩的展出。现在，展览会不仅介绍个别的经营单位——集体农庄、国营农场、饲畜场、机器拖拉机站，不仅介绍先进工作者和革新者，而且也介绍那些在一九五四年中取得农作物丰收，取得高度挤奶量，有成效地发展了畜牧业的整个边疆区、州和共和国。已取得在展览会上展出自己的产品这一光荣权利的有阿尔泰边疆区、莫斯科州、新西伯利亚州、库尔干州、阿克摩林斯克州、塞米巴拉敦斯克州、梁赞州和车里雅宾斯克州，阿塞拜疆共和国和塔吉克共和国。
    迅速扩大谷物生产的最切实可行的办法之一就是开垦生荒地和熟荒地。展览会对这个问题给予特别的注意。只须指出下面这一点就足以说明，即无论在中央展览馆或是在“俄罗斯联邦”、“西伯利亚”、“哈萨克共和国”、“谷物”、“乌拉尔”、“农艺”、“畜牧业”、“伏尔加河流域”、“农业机械化和电气化”、“水利”、“林业”各展览馆，都有专为介绍开垦荒地而设置的展览台。
    在“俄罗斯联邦展览馆”里有关于共和国开垦生荒地和熟荒地的总情况的材料，关于完成一九五四年计划的材料，并介绍了在新地上取得丰收的各先进边疆区、州和个别农场的经验。“国营农场展览馆”对于取得谷物丰收和组织新国营农场作了广泛的说明。在“谷物展览馆”和“农艺展览馆”里，对于在生荒地上取得丰收的农业技术的科学原理，在这些土地上实行合乎科学的耕作制度的原理，在生荒地上实行马尔采夫耕作方法，都作了反映。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在非黑土地带各州和各自治共和国的农业工作者会议上曾特别注意于数百万公顷的全休闲地这一巨大的潜力。一九五五年的苏联农业展览会将展示出那些曾成功地利用全休闲地来取得玉蜀黍丰收，并在收获玉蜀黍后又播种了秋播作物的先进集体农庄的经验。
    展览会对于玉蜀黍这一最珍贵的谷物和饲料作物给予极大的注意。几乎有九十个展览台是整个用来说明种育玉蜀黍的农艺技术的，而在一百七十五个展览台上则是同其他作物一道来对这项农艺技术作了说明。
    拉脱维亚共和国的集体农庄在一九五四年第一次大规模栽种了玉蜀黍。古尔宾区“康普达尔比巴”集体农庄从每公顷土地上平均收了八百四十公担玉蜀黍。这就使该农庄能在去年夏天以三百三十六吨的绿色茎秆来饲养牲畜，并于秋天用玉蜀黍来做成百分之四十五的青贮饲料，在这个农庄里，共产党员是争取玉蜀黍丰收的发起者。领导他们工作的是共青团组织的书记、工作组组长雅·齐齐罗夫斯卡娅。
    非黑土地带谷物经济科学研究所和昆采夫区
  “新生活之路”集体农庄的例子说明，在莫斯科州不仅能够取得绿色茎秆的丰收，而且也能够取得玉米粒和玉米棒的丰收。
    苏共中央一月全会指出了发展畜牧业对国民经济的重大意义。苏联农业展览会今年搜集了为研究和总结畜牧业先进工作者经验的大批材料。
    在“牛”类展览馆中，展出了“卡拉冈达”国营农场的红草原种的“莫罗什加”乳牛。它的挤奶量一年达一万三千零七十七公斤。
    在饲畜场部分介绍了莫斯科州“尼康诺夫斯克”国营农场的饲畜场的情况，这里养着黑花种乳牛，每头乳牛一年产奶达六千四百五十四公斤；也介绍了莫斯科州“高尔克—二”国营农场的饲畜场的情况，这里每头乳牛一年产奶量达到六千零七十二公斤。
    在“养马业”展览馆中展出了二十五种马，其中有阿尔查马斯州“林中垦地”养马场的种马“日列比”。这种种马拖重的最高纪录达一万六千二百七十四公斤。
    保证牲畜有足够数量的精饲料、多汁饲料和粗饲料，对于畜牧业的迅速发展有着决定性的意义。这就要求我们必须彻底来改进饲料基地的组织工作。
    在播种和栽种展览部的露天地段将按原来的样子展出参加展览会的集体农庄的两种饲料轮作制：尼古拉也夫州“巴桑”机器拖拉机站各集体农庄的饲料九区轮作和莫斯科州列宁区“弗拉基米尔·伊里奇”集体农庄饲畜场附近地区的饲料蔬菜八区轮作。
    农业的新计划制度在展览会上也获得反映，这个制度今年已开始在各集体农庄和国营农场实行。
    库尔斯克州霍姆托夫区“赫鲁晓夫故乡”集体农庄就是这样的一个示范农场。这个农庄有着巨大的多部门经济，它使用着一千七百七十八公顷土地。一九五四年这个集体农庄从自己的经营中获得了三百一十万卢布的现金收入。这个集体农庄的庄员们决定在今年一年内把谷物的生产量增加一倍，并在两年到三年中完成苏共中央一月全会所规定的畜产品生产的任务。今年这个农庄所计划的现金收入应当是四百六十五万五千卢布。
    展览会外的各集体农庄对于掌握农业劳动者的先进成就，也给予了巨大帮助。
    在这些农庄中应当指出的有莫斯科州昆采夫区“新生活之路”集体农庄——这个农庄由于采用了玉蜀黍，使每头乳牛的挤奶量在短时期内就提高到三千四百零九公斤，有沃洛克拉姆区取得亚麻纤维丰收的“伊里奇之路”集体农庄，有鲁赫维茨区的“斯大林”集体农庄以及其他农庄。少年自然科学者中央实验站也将在展览会以外展出。
    在苏联农业展览会一九五五年开放期间，将着重注意于取得农作物丰收和提高畜产品生产率的各项方法的宣传，注意于广泛推行进步的劳动方法和实际运用这些方法的各项问题。
    一九五五年内将有数百万人，几十万农业劳动者参观苏联农业展览会。他们将在这里熟悉最优秀的先进工作者的和最优秀的集体农庄的经验，以便在回到家乡后，能在实际生产中采用这些经验来迅速完成共产党和苏联政府向农业工作者提出的任务。
