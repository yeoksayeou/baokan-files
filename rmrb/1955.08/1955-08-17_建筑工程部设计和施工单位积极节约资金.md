The design and construction units under the Construction Engineering Department have achieved preliminary results in saving construction funds. Currently, after criticizing the tendency to pursue so-called "national forms" and revivalism in design, many design unit personnel have stopped designing in the "big roof" style and have generally revised unreasonable designs. After the revisions, the cost of construction has generally been reduced by about 20 to 30 percent. Among them, the Northeast Industrial Architectural Design Institute alone, by modifying thirteen design projects, has initially calculated savings of more than 4.57 million yuan for the state.

After exposing and inspecting waste in construction, the construction units under the Construction Engineering Department have adopted many effective measures to save money. For example, the Luoyang Engineering Bureau gradually eliminated large-scale waste by reducing the cost of temporary projects and strengthening the management of materials and machinery. This bureau saved the state more than 730,000 yuan in investment by using bamboo and wood structures and reducing some unnecessary temporary projects when building auxiliary enterprises. The First Engineering Company of the Northeast Engineering Management Bureau made extensive use of waste materials and substitutes, using more than 6,000 cubic meters of old wood for the project, worth more than 300,000 yuan. After the construction units under the Central South Engineering Administration generally adopted bamboo scaffolding, the cost was reduced by 57 percent compared with using wood scaffolding.

Various design and construction units have also established some saving systems. The Materials Section of the First Engineering Office of the Second Engineering Company of the Northeast, based on the past chaotic material management situation, revised the material approval procedures and established and strengthened the material labeling and quota requisition systems, thereby greatly reducing material losses compared to the past. The 304 Work Zone of the North China Taiyuan Engineering Bureau, based on the situation that most foremen could not calculate the water-cement ratio and caused waste, developed a table for coordinating water and cement, and distributed it to each foreman, which eliminated waste. Many construction units have also established an economic activity analysis system to promptly identify the causes of waste in construction and find ways to overcome them.

Currently, many units have begun to establish a style of strict economy. Purchasing personnel in some units are able to pay attention to purchasing raw materials according to plan and do a good job in investigating sources of supply. An engineer from the Second Engineering Company of the Northeast, after repeated research and comparison when arranging the location of rubble piles, revised the original plan and saved more than 1,600 yuan in transportation costs. The company's employees also put forward more than 580 rationalization proposals, of which the 155 adopted by the Second Engineering Office alone can save the state more than 348,000 yuan.

    建筑工程部设计和施工单位积极节约资金
    建筑工程部所属设计和施工单位节约建设资金得到了初步成绩。目前，许多设计单位的人员，经过批判在设计中追求所谓“民族形式”和复古主义的倾向后，已停止了“大屋顶”式的设计，并普遍修改了不合理的设计。经过修改后的设计，建筑造价一般都降低了百分之二十到三十左右，其中仅东北工业建筑设计院修改的十三个设计项目，据初步计算就为国家节省投资四百五十七万多元。
    建筑工程部所属的各施工单位，在揭发和检查了施工中的浪费现象后，采取了许多有效的节约措施。如洛阳工程局采取降低临时工程造价、加强材料和机具管理等措施后，逐步消除了大宗的浪费现象。这个局在建设附属企业时，采用竹木结构，并核减了一些不必要的临时工程，就为国家节省了七十三万元以上的投资。东北工程管理总局第一工程公司广泛利用废料和代用品，仅利用到工程上的旧木料就有六千多立方公尺，价值三十多万元。中南工程管理局所属施工单位普遍采用竹脚手架后，成本比用木脚手架时降低了百分之五十七。
    各个设计和施工单位，还订出了一些节约的制度。东北第二工程公司第一工程处材料科根据过去材料管理混乱的情况，修订材料审批手续，建立和加强了材料挂牌和限额领料等制度，因而材料的损失比过去大大减少。华北太原工程局三零四工区，根据多数工长不会计算水灰比例而造成浪费的情况，由工区制定了一种配合水灰的表格，发给每个工长，结果消除了浪费现象。不少施工单位还建立了经济活动分析制度，及时发现施工中的浪费原因，找出克服办法。
    目前，许多单位开始树立了厉行节约的风气。有些单位的采购人员，能注意按计划采购原材料，并作好货源的调查工作。东北第二工程公司一位工程师在布置毛石堆放位置时，经过反复研究和比较，修改了原来所作的平面图，节约了搬运费一千六百多元。这个公司的广大职工，还提出了五百八十多件合理化建议，其中仅第二工程处采纳的一百五十五件，就可以为国家节省三十四万八千多元。
