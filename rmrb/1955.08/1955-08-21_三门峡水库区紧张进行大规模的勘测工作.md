In the Sanmenxia Reservoir area of the Yellow River, large-scale surveying and mapping work is being carried out intensively. Participating in this work are the Surveying and Mapping Brigade of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, as well as surveying personnel from the Huai River Conservancy Commission, the Shandong Provincial Water Conservancy Department, the Shanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, and the Yellow River Northwest Engineering Bureau supporting Sanmenxia, totaling more than 1,500 people. In October, they are to complete the field operations for the 1:10,000 topographic survey of the 4,277 square kilometer reservoir area, and by the end of the year, they are to submit the drawings for design purposes. According to statistics up to the end of July: 85 percent of the control point selection for the topographic survey has been completed, the fourth-order leveling has been fully completed, and the key to topographic survey – the detailed mapping – has completed one-third of the entire task.

The surveying team members are working every day, traversing mountains and rivers in the hot summer. A large number of advanced groups and model individuals have emerged among them, and ten groups have already been named "Youth Shock Brigades."

The local farmers are also vigorously supporting the work of the surveying teams. Wherever the surveying teams go, rooms are prepared for them. Many vehicles frequently transport grain and equipment for the surveying teams. The farmers protect every small flag and every marker planted by the surveying teams on the mountain tops as if they were guarding their own crops.

　　三门峡水库区紧张进行大规模的勘测工作
    在黄河三门峡水库区，大规模的测量工作正紧张进行。参加这一工作的有黄河水利委员会测量总队，以及淮河水利委员会、山东省水利厅、山西省水利局、黄河西北工程局支援三门峡的测量人员，共一千五百多人。十月份，他们要完成库区四千二百七十七平方公里的万分之一的地形测量的野外作业，年底要交出图纸进行设计。截至七月底统计：地形测量的图根选点已完成百分之八十五，四等水准已全部完成，地形测量的关键——碎部，已完成整个任务的三分之一。
    测量队员们，在炎热的夏天，翻山涉水，每天都在工作。他们当中出现了大批的先进小组和模范人物，现已有十个组被命名为“青年突击组”。
    当地农民也大力支援测量队的工作。测量队到了那里，那里就准备好了房间。经常有许多车辆为测量队搬运粮食、器材。农民对测量队在山头上插的每一面小旗，每一个标号，都像看守自己的庄稼一样地保护着。
