Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 30th, TASS dispatch: The United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee, as suggested by the heads of government of the four countries at the Geneva Conference, began work on August 29th at the United Nations Building. The Subcommittee will consider the opinions and suggestions made by the heads of government of the four countries in Geneva to discuss the issue of formulating a disarmament program that can be accepted by all.

　　The first meeting of the Subcommittee was chaired by Soviet representative Sobolev.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 29th, TASS dispatch: "Izvestia" published an article by Novikov, commenting on the resumption of the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee in New York on August 29th. The author wrote: The Subcommittee faces a complex and important task. However, the atmosphere of cooperation and the hope of mutual understanding established at the Geneva Conference of the heads of government of the four countries makes it possible to frankly exchange views on some of the most important international issues, including disarmament. To bring countries' views on disarmament closer and reach the necessary agreements, the Soviet government's proposal of May 10 on reducing armaments, banning atomic weapons, and eliminating the threat of a new war can serve as a realistic basis for the Subcommittee to carry out this work. The Soviet proposal took a major step forward in bringing the Soviet Union and Western countries closer on the issue of disarmament. Now the Soviet Union has reason to expect the Western countries to approach the Soviet Union's position on the issue of banning atomic weapons, which is of extreme significance for the solution of the entire disarmament issue. At the same time, the Soviet Union does not refuse to seriously study other proposals that have the desire to seek ways to solve the disarmament problem.

　　In order to seek a unanimously agreed solution, there must be sincerity towards each other during the meetings of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee to seriously discuss constructive proposals, a spirit that has always been lacking in the past. For example, as everyone knows, the aforementioned new proposal submitted by the Soviet Union to the United Nations has not actually been discussed, and the governments of the United States, Britain, and France have not yet expressed their attitudes towards these new proposals.

　　The author concluded by writing that the Geneva Conference strengthened the belief of the people of all countries that the most important international issue of modern times—the issue of reducing armaments and banning atomic weapons—can be resolved in the interests of peace and security.

　　联合国裁军委员会小组委员会开始工作
　　“消息报”载文指出国际合作和谅解气氛将有助于交换意见
    新华社三十日讯　塔斯社纽约讯：根据日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的建议，联合国裁军委员会小组委员会已于八月二十九日在联合国大厦开始工作。小组委员会将考虑四国政府首脑在日内瓦提出的意见和建议，来讨论关于制定一个可以为大家接受的裁军方案的问题。
    小组委员会第一次会议由苏联代表索波列夫担任主席。
    新华社二十九日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科二十八日讯：“消息报”刊载了诺维科夫写的一篇文章，评论联合国裁军委员会小组委员会八月二十九日在纽约复会。作者写道：小组委员会面临着复杂的重大任务。但是，四国政府首脑日内瓦会议建立的合作和希望互相谅解的气氛，使得有可能在一些最重要的国际问题上，包括在裁军问题上，坦率地交换意见。小组委员会要使得各国在裁军问题上的观点接近和达成必要的协议，苏联政府在五月十日提出的关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁的建议可以作为小组委员会进行这种工作的现实的基础。苏联的建议在使苏联同西方国家在裁军问题上的观点接近方面前进了一大步。现在苏联有理由期待西方国家接近苏联在禁止原子武器问题上所持的观点，这一问题对整个裁军问题的解决有着极重大的意义。苏联同时并不拒绝认真研究具有寻求解决裁军问题的途径的愿望的其他建议。
    为了求得一致同意的解决办法，在联合国裁军小组委员会的会议过程中必须相互都有诚意，来认真地讨论建设性的建议，而这种精神正是以前一向所缺乏的。例如，大家知道，苏联向联合国提出的上述新建议实际上还没有被讨论过，美国、英国和法国政府对这些新建议还没有表示态度。
    作者最后写道，日内瓦会议加强了各国人民的这种信念：现代最重要的一个国际问题——裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题是能够按照和平和安全的利益加以解决的。
