The Soviet scientist Academician Gerasimov, a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences delegation, is a scholar with extensive academic knowledge. He is not only an outstanding soil geographer, but also a natural geographer and a Quaternary geologist. During his two-month visit to China, he visited scientific research institutions and universities related to his specialty, and conducted field investigations with Chinese scientists. He provided a lot of assistance to the workers in these scientific departments in terms of work methods, work direction, and various specific issues. In terms of soil science, the suggestions he put forward are of great significance for solving the problems of soil formation and classification in China, for the further development of soil science in China in the future, and for strengthening the cooperation in soil science research between China and the Soviet Union.

He pointed out: "The further development of soil science in China has particularly important practical significance for improving agriculture and applying the latest achievements of agricultural science to agricultural practice." He believes that an important issue in soil science in China at present is to strengthen the theoretical research of soil science, especially the study of soil genesis in various places, and to formulate a complete classification system on the basis of this research; otherwise, the problem of improving soil fertility cannot be fundamentally solved, and it will also affect the large-scale soil resource survey work.

Based on his past understanding and this visit, he pointed out that the soil science research work in China in the past two decades has always been influenced by American eclecticism in soil science; after liberation, it gradually got rid of the American eclectic viewpoint. This situation is fully reflected in the soil maps of China in different periods. He believes that the past soil research work in China has achieved certain achievements, mainly in cultivating a group of cadres with scientific research capabilities through work, and accumulating considerable soil data through their investigation and analysis work. However, there are also many shortcomings, mainly the weak theoretical foundation, especially manifested in the fact that the main genetic soil types in China have not yet been formulated, and its geographical distribution law has not been clarified. The consequence of this shortcoming is that the method of empiricism dominates the soil research work, the sorting of soil data lacks a reliable scientific basis, the naming of soil types is chaotic, and soil science research cannot make good conclusions on agricultural utilization.

We used to think that we did not belong to any school and that we did not have any preconceived ideas about soil research, so we could absorb the achievements of soil research from various countries and develop China's own soil science. But in fact, this is not the case at all. Our soil research work has always been carried out under the control of American eclectic methods and viewpoints. Academician Gerasimov said: "There are two main schools of soil science in the world, one is the advanced Russian school—the Dokuchaev school, and the other is the German school of agricultural geology. American soil science is an attempt to combine the soil genesis principles of the Dokuchaev school with the incorrect principles of the agricultural geology school." This attempt is incorrect and impossible to achieve. We have taken this impassable road in the past; therefore, we have not been able to establish a scientific foundation for soil science so far, and remain in the stage where empiricism dominates.

We have a general understanding of the soil conditions in various places; but because we have not mastered the correct methods and lack a sound organization, we have not been able to make systematic and correct conclusions on the formation process, formation conditions, basic characteristics, and distribution laws of various soil types, and even caused confusion in the naming of soil types, resulting in great difficulties in science education and agricultural utilization. For example, our so-called "brown soil" and "gray-brown soil" in the past are distributed almost all over the country, but their characteristics, formation, and distribution laws have not been definitely clarified. Our research is only based on experience and references to foreign literature, naming and classification, and even mistakenly putting soils with different formation processes together, so of course it is difficult to definitely explain its unified characteristics, let alone clarify its formation and distribution laws.

Another example is the "juvenile soil" in various parts of China, which is the so-called "purple soil," "loess-like soil," and "gray-brown soil" in the past. Their common feature is that they have been strongly affected by human factors such as deforestation, grassland destruction, and land reclamation. However, the soil types of "purple soil" and "loess-like soil" only reflect the characteristics of the parent rock and have no genetic significance; the characteristics of "gray-brown soil" are even more inconsistent, some reflect the characteristics of the parent rock, but also include thin-layer soils under natural vegetation. We have not mastered their basic characteristics and classification principles for these soils. Academician Gerasimov helped us solve this problem. According to the Soviet soil genesis classification principles and the specific conditions of Chinese soil, he suggested changing the "purple soil" in Sichuan to "eroded soil on purple parent rock of yellow soil type," and the "gray-brown soil" rich in stones in the brown soil belt of Qinling Mountains to "coarse-boned thin-layer brown soil." This reflects the zonality and natural development law of the soil, and also shows the soil erosion process under the influence of cultivation and the juvenile stage of soil development under natural vegetation. This is not only in line with the principles of genetic classification, but also illustrates the differences in agricultural utilization.

Through field visits and discussions, especially the compilation of the soil map of China, he solved many problems for us, and introduced many Soviet soil science theories and methods, which gave us great inspiration and help in soil research work.

During the inspection process, he visited the Loess Plateau in the Northwest, the red soil area in the Southwest and South China, and the black calcium soil area in the Northeast. The Northeast black calcium soil area has a large area of wasteland, which is one of our main objects for expanding arable land in the future. During his visit to the Northeast, he proposed that in order to obtain stable agricultural yields, measures should be taken to increase the humus content in the western black calcium soil area, and protective forests should be built and artificial irrigation should be carried out; the central meadow black calcium soil area is suitable for the development of mixed farming and animal husbandry, and drainage measures and pasture cultivation should be carried out in this area; in order to solve the problem of saline-alkali soil in the black calcium soil area, an experimental station for soil genesis improvement research must be established first. These opinions he put forward are of great practical significance for the investigation and planning of rational land utilization in the Northeast black calcium soil area.

The natural environment of the red soil area is superior and suitable for the development of various subtropical and tropical crops, but there are serious problems in the soil. Therefore, the research on soil genesis and improvement has become the main link in the development of red soil. In the past, we have conducted a lot of research work and have achieved certain achievements, but we have not studied enough in the theory of genesis and development. In response to our weaknesses, he suggested that we must strengthen scientific research work, especially strengthen the work of long-term observation and experimental stations, conduct research on the laws of soil development under natural conditions and cultivation conditions, and put forward agricultural measures to improve fertility. Because if we cannot grasp the laws of genesis and development of red soil, it will be difficult to fundamentally solve the problem of its improvement and utilization.

The main problem in the Loess Plateau area in the Northwest is soil erosion, so water and soil conservation is the key issue in the comprehensive development of the Yellow River Basin. In recent years, we have done a lot of work and have achieved certain achievements. After the inspection, Academician Gerasimov criticized that our scientific research work was not enough, and believed that we should strengthen the research on the types, development laws and prevention methods of soil erosion, and should pay special attention to the research on the return of steep slopes to forests and grasslands. In terms of soil science, we should conduct research on the laws of soil development and measures to improve soil fertility. He once emphasized that we should not dogmatically apply the research results of Sobolev and Kozminko in the Soviet Union, because the natural conditions and erosion laws of the black calcium soil area in the Soviet Union are completely different from this region. This opinion of his is very worthy of our attention. We should strengthen the study of Soviet scientific achievements, understand its essence, and conduct creative research in conjunction with specific conditions to solve the problems of national construction.

Soil science plays a very important role in increasing yield per unit area, expanding cultivated land area, and carrying out river basin planning, but soil science research work is currently extremely weak. The current soil science research institutions are mainly in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, agricultural science research institutes in various provinces, and industrial departments. Both the quality and quantity need to be further developed to meet the requirements of socialist construction. After visiting the Institute of Soil Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Academician Gerasimov suggested that we strengthen the strength of soil physics, soil physical chemistry, and soil biology, systematically study the genesis and soil classification of major soil types, and start the compilation of the 1:1,000,000 soil map.

The opinions he put forward are of great help to the further development of the Institute of Soil Science. Although the research work of the Institute of Soil Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has already started, it is necessary to conduct in-depth research and improve the scientific level. At present, due to the limitation of manpower, the work of systematically studying the soil genesis and classification of the whole country and compiling the 1:1,000,000 soil map of China can only be carried out in combination with the current survey and research work in the Loess Plateau, the red soil area in South China, the black calcium soil in the Northeast, and the North China Plain, and then gradually develop and strengthen.

During this visit, he visited relatively few agricultural science research institutes, so he only put forward some general opinions. He believes that the task of soil work in agricultural science research institutes in various places is mainly to study the application of correct soil science theories to agricultural problems, study different agricultural measures on different soils in various regions, and help agricultural experiment stations solve soil problems in agriculture. Because agricultural technical measures and soil improvement must take soil conditions into account, which needs the help of soil scientists to solve. At present, the strength of the soil departments of agricultural science research institutes in various provinces is uneven, some are quite strong, and some are very weak. Generally speaking, they need to be further strengthened to complete these tasks.

He also mentioned that large-scale wasteland exploration, soil exploration in irrigation areas, and the widespread survey and mapping of state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives should be undertaken by industrial departments, and the task of the Academy of Sciences should be limited to helping solve the problems of soil genesis classification and survey and mapping methods. This opinion is very correct, because scientific research institutions cannot and should not increase a large number of personnel to undertake this kind of practical task. However, the strength of the industrial departments is relatively weak at present. Therefore, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Water Resources, and the agricultural and water conservancy organs of various provinces must pay special attention to vigorously developing soil survey and mapping and soil analysis work, otherwise they will not be able to meet the requirements of national construction.

In order to further develop soil science, training cadres is a key issue. The development of soil majors in universities plays an important role in solving this problem. I very much agree with Academician Gerasimov's opinion that in addition to strengthening the soil and agrochemical departments of agricultural colleges, it is urgently needed to establish biological and soil departments in comprehensive universities to train professionals in various disciplines of soil science to meet the needs of research institutions and universities. The training of senior research cadres can be carried out through postgraduates and sending students to study abroad, in addition to training in work. Only by trying to train in many ways can the problem of cadre shortage be quickly solved.

The visit of Academician Gerasimov, a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences delegation, helped us solve many problems in soil science, helped us clarify the direction of further development in the future, and made further progress in the exchange of soil science and technology between China and the Soviet Union. We should strengthen the study of the advanced Soviet soil science theory on the original basis, continue to develop the creative cooperation between the soil science of the two countries, and strive for the socialist construction of our country.

    苏联科学家给我国土壤学者的启示
    中国科学院土壤研究所所长  马溶之
    苏联科学院代表团团员格拉西莫夫院士是一位学术渊博的学者，他不仅是卓越的土壤地理学家，也是自然地理学家和第四纪地质学家。在访问中国的两个月内，他参观了同他的专业有关的科学研究机关和高等学校，并且跟我国科学工作者一同到野外进行了实地考察，在工作方法、工作方向和各种具体问题上，都给了这些科学部门的工作者不少的帮助。在土壤科学方面，他所提出的建议，对中国土壤生成和分类问题的解决，对今后中国土壤科学的进一步发展，对加强中苏两国土壤科学研究的合作，都具有重大的意义。
    他指出：“中国土壤科学的进一步发展，对于提高农业和把农业科学的最新成就应用于农业实践，有特殊重要的实际意义。”他认为中国目前土壤科学的一个重要问题，是加强土壤科学理论的研究，特别是各地土壤发生学的研究，并且在这种研究基础上拟定一套完善的分类制度；否则不能根本解决提高土壤肥力的问题，也会影响到大规模的土壤资源勘查工作。
    根据他过去的了解和这次的访问，他指出中国过去二十几年的土壤科学研究工作，始终是受美国折衷主义的土壤科学的影响；解放以后，才逐渐摆脱了美国折衷主义的观点。在不同时期的中国土壤图上，就充分地反映了这种情况。他认为中国过去的土壤研究工作有一定的成就，主要是在工作中培养了一批具有科学研究能力的干部，通过他们的调查分析工作，积累了相当丰富的土壤资料。但是也有不少的缺点，主要是理论基础薄弱，特别表现在至今还没有拟定出中国主要发生学土类，以及阐明它的地理分布规律。这种缺点的后果，就使经验主义的方法在土壤研究工作中占统治的地位，使土壤资料的整理缺乏可靠的科学基础，使土类的命名混乱，使土壤科学研究不能在农业利用上作出很好的结论。
    我们过去曾经自以为不属于任何学派，对土壤研究工作也说不上有任何成见，这样可以吸取各国土壤研究的成果，发展中国自己的土壤科学。但事实上完全不是这样，我们的土壤研究工作是始终在美国折衷主义的方法和观点支配下进行的。格拉西莫夫院士说：“世界土壤科学主要有两个学派，一是先进的俄国学派——杜库恰耶夫学派，一是德国的农业地质学派。美国的土壤科学是企图把杜库恰耶夫学派的土壤发生学原则和农业地质学派不正确的原则结合起来。”这种企图是不正确而且是不可能实现的。我们过去恰好走了这条不通的路；因此至今尚没有能够建立起土壤学的科学基础来，而停留在以经验主义占统治地位的阶段。
    我们对各地土壤情况，已有一般了解；但由于没有掌握正确的方法，又缺乏健全的组织，所以对各种土类的生成过程，生成条件、基本特性和分布规律，没有能够作出系统的和正确的结论，甚至在土类的命名上造成混乱的现象，以致在科学教育和农业利用上，都发生了很大的困难。例如我们过去所谓的“棕壤”和“灰棕壤”，它的分布范围几乎遍于全国，但是没有肯定阐明它的特性、生成和分布规律。我们的研究仅是凭经验，参考各国文献，定名分类，甚至错误地把生成过程不同的土壤放在一起，这样当然就很难肯定地说明它的统一特性，更不能阐明它的生成和分布规律。
    再如中国各地都有“幼年土”，就是过去所谓“紫色土”“黄土性土”和“灰棕色土”等，它们的共同特点是强烈地受到了砍伐森林、破坏草地和开荒耕垦等人为因素的影响。但是“紫色土”和“黄土性土”这种土类，仅是反映成土母岩的特性，没有发生学的意义；“灰棕色土”的特征更不一致，有的是反映母岩的特性，但是也包括自然植被下的薄层土壤。我们对这些土壤，并没有掌握它们的基本特性和分类原则。格拉西莫夫院士帮助我们解决了这个问题。他根据苏联土壤发生学分类原则，和中国土壤的具体情况，建议把四川的“紫色土”改为“黄壤型紫色母岩上的侵蚀土壤”，秦岭棕壤带内富含石块的“灰棕色土”改称为“粗骨薄层棕壤”。这样就反映出土壤的地带性和自然的发育规律，另一方面也分别表现出在耕种影响下的土壤侵蚀过程和在自然植被下土壤发育的幼年阶段。这不但是合乎发生学分类的原则，同时也说明了农业利用上的区别。
    通过实地考察和座谈，特别是编制中国土壤图，他为我们解决了不少的问题，并且介绍了许多苏联的土壤学理论和方法，在土壤研究工作上给了我们很大的启发和帮助。
    在各地考察的过程中，他曾到过西北的黄土高原区、西南和华南的红壤区和东北的黑钙土区。东北黑钙土区有广大面积的荒地，这是我们今后扩大耕地面积的主要对象之一。他到东北考察时，曾经提出为了获得稳定的农业产量，在西部黑钙土区应当采取增加腐殖质含量的措施，并且需要建造防护林和进行人工灌溉；中央的草甸黑钙土区是宜于发展农牧的混合区，在这个地区内应当采取排水的措施和进行牧草的培育工作；为了解决黑钙土区的盐碱土问题，须首先建立土壤生成改良研究的试验站。他所提出的这些意见，对东北黑钙土区土地合理利用的调查规划，具有极大的实际意义。
    红壤区的自然环境是优越的，适宜于发展各种亚热带和热带作物，但是在土壤上却有严重的问题，因此土壤生成和改良的研究就成为红壤开发的主要环节。过去我们进行了不少的研究工作，也有了一定的成就，但是在生成发育的理论上研究得不够。他针对我们的弱点，建议必须加强科学研究工作，特别是加强长期观察试验站的工作，进行在自然条件下和耕作情况下土壤发育规律的研究，并且提出提高肥力的农业措施。因为若不能掌握红壤的生成发育规律，就很难根本解决对它的改良利用问题。
    西北黄土高原区的主要问题是土壤侵蚀，因此水土保持工作是黄河流域全面开发的关键问题。近几年来我们已经做了不少的工作，也有了一定的成就。格拉西莫夫院士在考察之后，批评我们科学研究工作做得不够，认为应当加强土壤侵蚀的类型、发展规律和防止方法的研究，特别应当注意陡坡退耕的研究，而在土壤科学方面，应当进行土壤发育规律和提高土壤肥力措施的研究。他曾经强调指出：不要教条地运用苏联索保列夫和柯兹敏科等的研究成果，因为苏联黑钙土区的自然条件和侵蚀规律同这个区域完全不同。他这个意见是很值得我们注意的。我们应当加强学习苏联科学成就，领会它的精神实质，结合具体情况，进行创造性的研究，以解决祖国生产建设上的问题。
    土壤科学在提高单位面积产量、扩大耕地面积、进行流域规划等方面，起相当重要的作用，但是土壤科学研究工作目前却是极其薄弱的。目前的土壤科学研究机构主要是在中国科学院、各省农业科学研究所和产业部门，无论是质量和数量，都需要进一步发展才能满足社会主义建设的要求。格拉西莫夫院士参观了中国科学院土壤研究所后，建议我们加强土壤物理学、土壤物理化学和土壤生物学方面的力量，系统地进行主要土类生成和土壤分类的研究，并展开百万分之一土壤图的编制工作。
    他所提的这些意见，对土壤研究所的进一步发展有很大的帮助。中国科学院土壤研究所的研究工作虽然已经展开，但是须要深入研究和提高科学水平。目前因为限于人力，系统地研究全国土壤生成和分类以及编制中国百万分之一土壤图的工作，只有同目前在黄土高原、华南红壤区、东北黑钙土和华北平原的调查研究工作相结合来进行，然后逐步发展和加强。
    在这次访问过程中，他参观的农业科学研究所比较少，因此仅提了一些原则性的意见。他认为各地农业科学研究所的土壤工作任务，主要是研究正确的土壤科学理论在农业问题上的应用，研究各地区不同土壤上的不同农业措施，帮助农业试验站解决农业上的土壤问题。因为农业技术措施和土壤改良等必须要考虑到土壤条件，这是需要土壤科学家帮助解决的。目前各省的农业科学研究所土壤部门的力量是不平衡的，有的相当强，有的就很薄弱，一般地说都须要进一步地加强，才能完成这些任务。
    他也曾提到：大规模的荒地勘查、灌区土壤勘查和普遍地展开国营农场和农业生产合作社的调查制图工作，应当由产业部门担任，科学院的任务应当限于帮助解决土壤生成分类，以及调查制图的方法问题。这个意见是很正确的，因为科学研究机关不可能也不应当大量增加人员来担任这种实践性的任务。但目前产业部门的力量比较薄弱，因此，农业部、水利部和各省农业水利机关，必须特别注意大力发展土壤调查制图和土壤分析工作，否则不能满足国家建设的要求。
    为了进一步发展土壤科学，培养干部是一个关键问题。对于这一问题的解决，高等学校土壤专业的发展，起着重要的作用。我很同意格拉西莫夫院士的意见，除了加强农业学院的土壤农化系外，迫切需要在综合大学内建立生物土壤系，培养土壤学各学科的专业人才，以满足研究机关和高等学校的需要。高级研究干部的培养，除了在工作中培养外，还可以采取研究生和选送留学生等办法。只有从多方面设法培养，才能很快地解决干部缺乏问题。
    这次苏联科学院代表团团员格拉西莫夫院士的访问，帮助我们解决了很多土壤学方面的问题，帮助我们明确了今后进一步发展的方向，对中苏两国土壤科学技术交流上有了进一步的发展。我们应当在原有基础上加强学习苏联的先进土壤科学理论，继续发展两国土壤科学的创造性的合作，为我国的社会主义建设而奋斗。
