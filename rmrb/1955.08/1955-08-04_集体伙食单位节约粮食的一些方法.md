Some Methods for Collective Mess Halls to Save Food

Master Eating Patterns, Improve Management Systems

	△ Shanghai's Fudan University takes note of the number of diners when cooking rice, registering the number of people not eating dinner on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays on campus. Additionally, they consider factors like the weather, the swelling properties of the rice, and the vegetables when determining how much rice to cook per meal. Initial estimates suggest that by simply reducing leftover rice and properly handling it, they can save 400 jin of rice per month.

	△ The canteen of the Hankou Tea Factory implemented a "pre-sale system" to accurately determine the number of diners and the amount of food needed. Every day at 8:00 AM, statistics personnel take meal tickets to the workshops and departments to pre-sell meals for the following day. The canteen cooks based on the pre-sale numbers, essentially eliminating leftover food.

	△ The Mess Hall Committee of Shanghai's private Zhongfu Woolen Fabric Factory implemented a simple meal registration method: When employees will not be eating at the factory, they hang a bamboo tag on their employee number indicating "No Lunch," "No Dinner," or "No Meals Today." Cooks then cook rice based on the actual number of diners per meal. This ensures that the right amount of food is prepared for each meal, greatly reducing waste.

	△ The Tianjin Consumer Cooperative staff canteen serves people from the supply and marketing cooperative, nearby branches, and even rural joint cooperatives, resulting in fluctuating numbers of diners. To manage this, the canteen maintains regular contact with relevant units, finding out in advance when the joint cooperatives will be meeting and preparing more food accordingly. They also prepare more when the consumer cooperative has evening meetings or movie screenings and prepare less on Saturday evenings when many comrades go home. This avoids both leftover food and shortages.

	△ The Tianjin Taxation Bureau has implemented a monthly planned meal registration system since July. It issues full meal cards, half meal cards (for one meal), and breakfast cards to all participants. All diners use these cards, ensuring that they can eat and that grain usage does not exceed the plan. Previously, steamed buns cost three cents each, and rice was available in five-cent and ten-cent portions. Due to the large quantities, some people couldn't finish their portions, leading to waste. Now, steamed buns are available in two-cent and three-cent sizes, and rice is available in two-cent, four-cent, and eight-cent portions, allowing individuals to buy according to their needs. They sometimes mix potatoes into the flour when making pancakes and plan to add potatoes to steamed buns, filled cakes, date cakes, and sesame cakes, or use potatoes instead of red beans for fillings. This is expected to save 230 jin of staple grains per month.

	△ The cooks at Harbin Institute of Technology not only focus on saving grain during their operations but also actively study the eating habits of students and staff. When cooking each day, they first consider the weather (hot or cold) and whether people will eat more or less, then decide how much rice to cook. As a result, for a large canteen serving six to seven hundred people, they have at most one basin of leftover rice per meal, and sometimes no leftovers at all, greatly reducing waste.

	△ The Guangzhou Railway Bureau's staff canteen serves a highly mobile population with fluctuating numbers of diners that cannot be predicted in advance. The cooks came up with a solution: cook according to the usual average consumption and boil a pot of water and prepare rice in reserve. If they find the number of diners increasing, they can immediately cook more. In early March, forty or fifty extra people suddenly came to dinner one evening. Seeing this, the cooks immediately washed rice and put it on to cook. The rice cooked later was ready just as the first batch ran out. On another occasion, the canteen had prepared the rice, but the staff had all gone to a meeting at the Railway Bureau in Dongshan. The canteen director thought, "If the meeting ends late, the staff might think the canteen is closed and won't come back to eat. Wouldn't that waste all the prepared food?" So, he rushed to the meeting place and told everyone that the canteen had prepared food and would serve them even if they were late, hoping they would return to the canteen to eat. Because they usually paid close attention to changes in the number of diners, even though about two thousand people eat there every day, there is very little leftover food.

	△ In Hangzhou, 468 units converted from a fixed meal system to a pay-per-meal system in June and July. The average daily grain consumption per person decreased by 3.5 liang compared to the average consumption in April and May, saving the state a total of 400,000 jin of grain per month. The average daily grain consumption per worker in the Construction Second Team of the Hangzhou Construction Bureau decreased by about 4.5 liang compared to before the implementation of the pay-per-meal system, and the Hangzhou Tea Factory decreased by 6 liang.

Improve Cooking Techniques, Prevent Grain Spillage

	△ The cooks at the Xinhua Dairy Farm of the Beijing Southern Suburb Farm try their best not to have leftover rice. If there are leftovers, they are actively utilized. They grill leftover corn cakes whole or sliced and save them for breakfast the next day, or they soak them in water and mix them into cornmeal for steaming again. They use a ladle to scoop out the rice grains from leftover congee, then mix them into white flour to make steamed buns. If there are many leftover steamed buns or corn cakes, they make less dry food for the next meal and make a pot of hot noodle soup to go with it.

	△ The cooks at the middle canteen of the Xining Public Security Bureau knead leftover rice and scorched rice into the dough for steamed buns; add small pieces of potatoes and vegetables to leftover noodles for flavoring; and use the thick noodle soup left over from making noodles to make a mixed soup with oil and chopped green onions, which tastes good and doesn't waste any grain.

	△ The Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Mill bakes leftover steamed buns dry, crushes them, and uses them instead of breadcrumbs for cooking. The cooks at the Crane Machinery Factory mix crushed leftover steamed buns with fresh flour to steam steamed buns or bake pancakes, and the leftover pancakes are made into braised pancakes, which the workers love to eat.

	△ The Kunming Taxation Bureau soaks the scorched rice from the previous meal in boiling water and mixes it into the next meal to be re-stewed. This makes the cooked rice more delicious and saves firewood.

	△ A certain hospital in Hefei City proposed "five clean" and "four cares," requiring that rice bowls, tables, floors, rice buckets, and flour sacks are clean; and that the sick are asked about often, given seconds of food often, given small portions, and are never given the wrong food; and they also changed large steamed buns into small steamed buns. In this way, the average monthly grain consumption per person has been reduced by more than six jin compared to before.

	△ Cooks in factories such as the Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory installed wire mesh or bamboo screens in the rice washing pools, and the Changzhou Minfeng Yarn Factory installed showerheads on the rice washing tanks to prevent rice grains from being washed away by the water.

	△ To prevent rice grains from being spilled when serving rice, Kunming No. 1 Middle School placed white cloth on the serving table, and the Tianjin Woolen Mill placed white cloth under the rice buckets so that rice grains dropped on the cloth could still be eaten.

	△ The cooks at Tianjin University installed white cloth pockets around the kneading table to prevent flour from spilling on the ground during kneading. The cooks at Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Mill saved more than 100 jin of flour every three months by sweeping the flour sacks clean.

	△ Dalian Institute of Technology launched a "three nos" movement among students, requiring that no grain is dropped on the floor, no grain is dropped on the table, and no food is left in the bowl. Students supervise each other to ensure that no grain is wasted. On some tables, the students on dishwashing duty check for leftover food after each meal. Since the "three nos" movement was launched, the phenomenon of wasting food has been basically eliminated in the entire dining hall.

	△ All personnel at Hefei No. 2 Middle School in Anhui are involved in saving grain. The director of general affairs inspects the kitchen every day and deals with problems found in a timely manner. After each meal, the leftover rice and spilled rice grains are collected and exhibited, and broadcasted to the entire school through the school's broadcasting group. After a period of effort, the entire school of more than 1,200 people saves more than 130 jin of rice every day.

    集体伙食单位节约粮食的一些方法
    掌握用饭规律，改进管理制度
    △上海复旦大学煮饭时注意掌握用饭人数，登记星期六晚餐、星期日和节日不在校吃饭的人数，另外还参照气候、米的涨性、菜蔬等情况考虑每顿要煮多少米。据初步估计：光是减少剩饭和对剩饭作适当处理，一个月就可以少浪费四百斤米。
    △汉口茶厂食堂为了正确掌握吃饭的人数和需要饭菜的数量，实行了“预售制”。每天上午八时，统计人员就把餐票带到车间和各部门预售第二天的饭菜，食堂根据预售的数字做饭，基本上消灭了剩饭剩馍的现象。
    △上海私营中孚呢绒厂伙食委员会实行一种简便的吃饭登记法：职工要不在厂里吃饭时，就在自己的工号上挂一块“中饭不吃”、“夜饭不吃”或“全日不吃”的竹签，炊事员根据每餐实吃的人数来烧饭。这样每餐饭总是不多不少，减少了很多浪费。
    △天津市消费合作社职工食堂吃饭的人有供销社的，有附近各分社的，还有郊区联村社的，人数忽多忽少。食堂为了掌握吃饭人数，采取经常同有关单位联系的办法，预先知道联村社什么时候来开会，就多预备一些饭菜；知道消费合作社晚上要开会或要看电影时，也多预备些；每逢星期六晚上，同志们回家的多，就少预备些。避免了剩饭或不够的现象。
    △天津市税务局从七月份起实行按月计划用饭登记制度，分别发给入伙的人全伙用饭证、半伙用饭证（吃一顿）、早点证，所有入伙的人都凭证用饭，这样就保证入伙的人能吃到饭，用粮又不超过计划。过去馒头是三分钱一个，米饭是五分一碗和一角一碗两种，因为数量多，有的人吃不了，造成浪费；现在馒头改为二分、三分两种，米饭改为二分、四分、八分三种，各人可以根据自己的需要去买。他们有时用马铃薯掺在面粉里做大饼，还准备在馒头、馅糕、枣糕、烧饼中掺马铃薯，或以马铃薯代红小豆做馅，这样预计一个月可以节省主粮二百三十斤。
    △哈尔滨工业大学的炊事员们不仅在自己的操作过程中注意节约粮食，还积极研究学生、职工们的吃饭规律，每天做饭的时候，首先考虑到天气冷热、人们吃得多或少，然后决定煮多少饭。因此，六、七百人吃饭的大灶，每顿饭最多剩下一盆，有时根本不剩饭，糟蹋剩饭的现象减少了。
    △广州铁路局职工食堂吃饭的人流动性很大，时多时少，又不能预先知道。炊事员们就想了一个办法：每天都按平时平均的供应量煮饭，做好饭以后，又烧出一锅开水，准备好米，一发现吃饭的人数增多，马上再煮。三月初有一天开晚饭时，突然新增加四、五十人吃饭，炊事员看到这个情况，马上洗米下锅，先煮的饭卖完时，后煮的刚好接上供应。有一次食堂的饭煮好了，职工们又都到东山的铁路管理局开会了。食堂主任想：会如果散得迟，职工们以为食堂过时没饭吃，不回来吃饭，那准备好的饭菜岂不要糟蹋了吗？于是他就赶到会场，告诉大家：食堂准备了饭菜，过时也供应，希望大家回食堂吃饭。由于他们平时密切注意吃饭人的变动情况，虽然每天约有两千人吃饭，但剩饭很少。
    △杭州市六、七月份有四百六十八个单位将包饭制改为卖饭制，平均每人每天的粮食消费量比四、五两月的平均消费量降低了三两五钱，总计每月可为国家节约四十万斤粮食。杭州市建设局基建第二中队工人平均每人每天的粮食消费量比实行卖饭制前降低了四两半左右，杭州茶厂降低了六两。
  改进炊事技术，防止抛撒粮食
    △北京南郊农场新华奶牛工作站的炊事员做饭时尽量做到不剩饭，万一剩下了，也能积极利用。他们把剩的窝窝头整烤或切片烤好，留着第二天当早点；或是用水泡开，掺到玉米面里再蒸。剩下的稀饭，用笊篱把米粒捞出来，再掺到白面里做馒头。如果馒头、窝窝头剩得比较多，他们下一顿就少做干的，另做一锅热面汤，配搭着吃。
    △西宁市公安局中灶炊事员，把剩下的米饭和锅巴揉到面里蒸馒头；在剩面条里放些小块马铃薯、再加些菜调和；把做面条剩下的稠面汤加些油和葱花做成拌汤，味道又好吃，又不浪费一点粮食。
    △天津市棉纺二厂把剩下的馒头烤干轧碎，代替面包渣做菜。起重机械厂把剩馒头弄碎同新面掺在一起蒸馒头或烙饼，剩下的饼又做烩饼，职工们都很爱吃。
    △昆明市税务局把上一餐饭出的锅巴用开水泡开，拌在下一餐饭中重焖，这样，煮出来的饭又好吃，又节省了烧柴。
    △合肥市某医院提出“五光”“四要”，要求做到饭碗光、桌子光、地上光、饭桶光、面袋米袋光；对病员要多问、要勤添、要少盛、要不送错；同时把大馒头改为小馒头。这样平均每人每月的用粮量就比以前减少了六斤多。
    △天津纺织机械厂等工厂的炊事员在淘米的水池上安装铁丝网或竹筛子，常州民丰纱厂在淘米缸上加装莲蓬头，防止淘米时米粒被水冲走。
    △为了防止盛饭时抛撒饭粒，昆明第一中学在打饭的桌上垫了白布，天津毛织厂在饭桶底下铺了白布，饭粒掉在布上还可以吃。
    △天津大学炊事员在面案周围安装了白布兜，使合面时面粉不致撒落地上。天津棉纺四厂的炊事员三个月扫空面粉袋就节省了一百多斤面粉。
    △大连工学院在学生中开展了“三不”运动，要求做到地下不掉粮食、桌上不掉粮食、碗里不剩饭菜。同学之间互相监督，大家保证不浪费一粒粮食，有的饭桌上每次吃完饭后，都由值班洗碗的同学检查有无剩饭。开展“三不”运动以来，整个饭厅基本上消除了浪费饭菜的现象。
    △安徽合肥市第二中学全校人员都投入了节约粮食工作，总务主任每天都到厨房进行检查，及时处理发现的问题。每次吃过饭都把剩饭和抛撒的米粒、饭粒收集起来展览，并通过校内广播组向全校广播。经过一个时期的努力，全校一千二百多人每天要节约一百三十多斤大米。
