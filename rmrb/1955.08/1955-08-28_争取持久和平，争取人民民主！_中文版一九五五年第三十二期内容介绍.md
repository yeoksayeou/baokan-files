　　"Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!"
　　Introduction to the Contents of the Chinese Version, 1955, No. 32
　　The Chinese version of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" No. 32, 1955, has been published.
　　This issue features an editorial entitled "Strengthening Trust Between Countries, Striving for World Peace and Security," commenting on the Third Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The editorial points out: It is quite natural that people all over the world continue to widely discuss the results of the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference. The Four-Power Summit Conference has had a positive impact on the entire international situation, weakening the position of reactionary forces and strengthening the position of peace fighters. It marks the victory of the spirit of cooperation and mutual understanding, the spirit of negotiation. The editorial details the Soviet Union's efforts during and after the Geneva Conference to strengthen trust between countries and strive for world peace and security. The editorial points out that it is very clear that broad cooperation between countries, especially major powers, will play a significant role in easing international tensions and establishing the necessary trust between countries. The editorial emphasizes that there is no doubt that many difficulties will still be encountered in the future, and we still need to make great efforts to solve many international problems. However, as long as all parties concerned are sincere and maintain the spirit of cooperation prominently displayed at the Geneva Conference, these difficulties can be overcome, and international cooperation will be expanded and further consolidated.
　　Important articles published in this issue include: "Training Cadres is a Major Task of the Italian Communist Party" by Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party; "The German Socialist Unity Party Strives to Further Develop the Agriculture of the German Democratic Republic" by Mückenberger, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party; and "Consolidating the Friendship Between Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia for Peace and Socialism" by Kautsky, Member of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and Editor-in-Chief of "Red Rights Daily."
　　Togliatti's article is an abstract of his speech at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party in July. Togliatti emphatically pointed out that a very important issue in Italy at present is the issue of the Italian Communist Party's cadres and their training. The Italian Communist Party is a party supported by the broad masses of the people, and at the same time, its cadres are sufficient in both quantity and quality to ensure the completion of work. The overall political situation in Italy, especially the policies of the Christian Democratic Party, has undergone certain changes, so we have new working conditions. At present, we urgently need to rapidly train cadres. If we train a large number of new cadres who can truly safeguard the political and economic actions led by the party and the trade union, then we can fundamentally change the situation in Italy. We must know what our enemies are doing, we must study them in depth, and we must also consider developments in all aspects. In order to be able to fight and take the necessary actions, we must do this.

专栏：

　　“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
　　中文版一九五五年第三十二期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五五年第三十二期中文版已经出版。
    这一期以“加强国与国之间的信任，争取世界和平和安全”为题发表社论，评论苏联最高苏维埃第三次会议。社论指出：全世界人士继续广泛讨论日内瓦四大国政府首脑会议的结果，这是十分自然的。四国政府首脑会议对整个国际局势产生了良好的影响，它削弱了反动势力的地位，加强了和平战士的地位。它标志着合作和相互谅解的精神，谈判的精神的胜利。社论详述了苏联在日内瓦会议期间和会后在加强国与国之间的信任和争取世界和平和安全方面的努力。社论指出，非常清楚，国与国之间，特别是大国之间的广泛合作一定会在缓和国际紧张局势和在国与国之间建立必要的信任方面发生重大作用。社论强调说，毫无疑问，今后还会遇到不少的困难，我们还要尽很大的努力来解决许多国际问题。但是，只要有关各方都具有诚意并且保持日内瓦会议上突出地表现出来的合作精神，这些困难是可以克服的，国际合作一定会扩大和更加巩固。
    这一期刊载的重要文章有：意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂的“培养干部是意大利共产党的重大任务”，德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局候补委员穆肯柏格尔的“德国统一社会党为进一步发展德意志民主共和国的农业而奋斗”，捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员、“红色权利报”总编辑考茨基的“为和平与社会主义而巩固捷克斯洛伐克和南斯拉夫之间的友谊”等。
    陶里亚蒂的文章是他七月间在意大利共产党中央全会上的讲话摘要。陶里亚蒂着重指出，意大利当前在国内的一个十分重要的问题是意大利共产党的干部和他们的培养问题。意大利共产党是一个得到广大人民拥护的党，同时它的干部在数量上和质量上都足以保证做好工作。意大利总的政治形势，特别是天主教民主党的政策，已经发生了某些转变，因此我们有了新的工作条件。目前我们迫切地需要迅速地培养干部。如果我们培养出大批真能维护党和工会所领导的政治行动和经济行动的新干部，那么我们就可以使意大利的形势发生根本的变化。我们必须知道我们的敌人在做什么，我们必须深入地研究他们，同时也要考虑到各方面的发展。为了能够进行斗争和采取必要的行动，我们必须这样做。
