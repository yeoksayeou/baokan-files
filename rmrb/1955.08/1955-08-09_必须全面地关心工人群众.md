    We Must Comprehensively Care for the Worker Masses
    Tong Dalin, Li Kan

    Our country's First Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy is a great plan, a program with decisive significance for the Chinese Communist Party leading the people of the whole country to struggle for the realization of the general line of the transition period. In the struggle to realize the Five-Year Plan, it is of paramount importance to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class nationwide.

    In the past few years, following the fundamental policy of "relying on the working class and developing production" stipulated by the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, China's industrial recovery and development have achieved great successes. In the future, we must continue to adhere to this fundamental policy, because only by relying on the working class can we guarantee the victorious completion of this great Five-Year Plan.

    Relying on the working class means relying on the working class's enthusiasm, creativity, and collective heroism in labor. To fundamentally change China's backward economic and technological state and to accomplish the unprecedentedly great historical task of building socialism, it is unimaginable without the conscious and active participation and selfless, heroic labor of the working class and all working people. Therefore, giving warm, comprehensive, and meticulous care to the worker masses in all aspects, from politics and culture and technology, to material interests and daily life, continuously improving the communist consciousness and cultural and technical level of the working class, and giving full play to the production enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers, becomes the main content of relying on the working class. It is also an important principle that our Party must invariably follow in the work of industrial and mining enterprises in the great struggle to build socialism.

    Caring for the improvement of the communist ideological consciousness of the worker masses should be a basic starting point for our Party's work. The working class cannot spontaneously generate socialist consciousness. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly propagate Marxism-Leninism to the worker masses, to constantly educate the worker masses in patriotism and internationalism, and to constantly educate the worker masses with the Party's general line and major policies, so that they gradually overcome the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie and small producers and become conscious and active fighters for building socialism.

    The practical experience of the past few years tells us that the communist ideological education of the worker masses must be closely integrated with the current class struggle. That is to say, if we do not proceed from the actual situation of class struggle in the transition period to improve the political awareness and revolutionary vigilance of the working class, if we do not use the viewpoint of class struggle to educate the worker masses to resolutely eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, if we do not struggle against all bourgeois ideas that invade the worker masses, or if we depart from the practical problems raised by the practice of industrial production and construction, and depart from the struggle between advanced and conservative and backward ideas among the worker masses, then this so-called political and ideological education will become tedious preaching, and will be lifeless and weak.

    Improving the communist ideological consciousness of the worker masses requires adopting the method of patient enlightenment education. Stalin said that the method of persuasion is the basic method of the Party leading its class. This principle must be strictly observed in ideological education work. However, in the past, some comrades, when carrying out political and ideological education for the worker masses, did not patiently enlighten and guide them, but adopted erroneous methods such as "labeling," "mass movements," and simple accusations and punishments. They did not regard the backward ideas and improper behaviors of some workers in their attitude towards labor, public property, and social and family life as the result of the influence of the old society and bourgeois ideas, and did not regard overcoming these backward ideas as an arduous and patient educational process. Instead, they often treated the worker masses with the above shortcomings as objects of struggle and carried out "criticism" by simple and crude methods. Some factories and mines did not conduct concrete analysis and research on the phenomena of lax labor discipline and poor product quality in a down-to-earth manner, and did not first check and self-criticize from the enterprise leadership, from management and ideological style, find out the root causes of shortcomings and errors, and find ways to improve. Instead, they attributed all the faults to the worker masses, made all kinds of accusations against the worker masses, labeled the worker masses with all kinds of "hats," and accused the workers of being incapable of this or that, as if the leadership had little responsibility for the many shortcomings and errors in the work of the factory and mine, but only because of the "ideological backwardness" of the worker masses. It should be pointed out that this is a practice that violates the principle of persuasive education and undermines the political enthusiasm of the workers. It is a manifestation of underestimating the degree of consciousness of the working class and reducing or denying the leading role and educational power of the Party over the working class. In fact, it ignores the infinite ability and noble qualities of the working class, which is the most advanced force in modern society and the only leading class in realizing socialist revolution in our country.

    The experience of the past few years has proved that the Party organizations in enterprises must be good at using the advanced ideas of the working class and the advanced examples of model figures among the worker masses to attract the broad masses of workers to move forward, and to inspire the backward part of the workers to consciously learn from the advanced part. This is a basic and most effective method of educating the worker masses. Unfortunately, this method is often forgotten or seriously ignored by some people.

    Adhering to the Party's principle of persuasive education towards the worker masses does not mean that we should abolish the comradely criticism and self-criticism within the working class. Criticism and self-criticism are always the most powerful ideological weapons within the working class and also the basic method of persuasive education. We know that within the ranks of the working class, there are advanced, intermediate, and backward parts. Especially with the development of industrial construction in our country, new elements are constantly pouring into the ranks of the working class. Some of them inevitably bring some ideological influence of the bourgeoisie and small producers, and the original part of the worker masses also maintains countless ties with the small producers in the society. Therefore, in order to train the working class into a fighting force with a high degree of class consciousness and a high degree of organization and discipline, we must carry out comradely criticism and self-criticism within the working class, and it is entirely necessary to give appropriate administrative punishments to those who have committed serious mistakes and have repeatedly refused to be educated, according to the seriousness of the circumstances. Because this kind of administrative punishment is the coercion of the majority of the working class against a few individuals, and this coercion is also based on persuasive education as the premise and foundation. Some comrades still lack a correct understanding of this issue. They believe that since it is necessary to emphasize the principle of adhering to persuasive education, then no matter who in the workers, and no matter what the situation, there should not be any coercion at all, or they use "mass viewpoint" and fear of making mistakes of "bureaucracy" and "punishment-ism" as excuses, and turn a blind eye to the individual serious violations of labor discipline, damage to state property, and even the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements who have infiltrated the ranks of the working class, and fail to take serious action. This practice is also wrong, because it harms the interests of the working class and the country, and is a manifestation of "tailism." It has nothing in common with the Party's mass viewpoint.

    Caring for the improvement of the cultural and technical level of the worker masses is an important part of the Party's political and ideological work in industrial and mining enterprises. Any view that belittles culture and technology or opposes culture and technology to politics is extremely wrong and harmful.

    There was a time when some industrial and mining enterprises put forward slogans such as "opposing the purely technical viewpoint," and some comrades in individual enterprises even believed that "studying technology is neglecting politics." We should oppose the tendency to neglect politics, but we must not oppose studying technology and delving into technology, and delving into technology does not necessarily mean neglecting politics. The reason why these statements are wrong is that they oppose politics to technology. It should be recognized that without improving the cultural and technical level of the working class and without strengthening our country's technical forces, we cannot guarantee the smooth implementation of the First Five-Year Plan and will hinder the smooth progress of socialist construction. Due to the extreme backwardness of the economy and technology of old China, the politically brave and strong Chinese working class has the weakness of a backward cultural and technical level, which is a great difficulty for us in carrying out socialist construction. The task of the Party is to vigorously promote and value culture and technology to gradually eliminate this weakness, so that the working class becomes not only a construction army with a high degree of communist consciousness, but also able to master modern science and technology.

    The Party should educate the cadres of enterprises and the broad masses of workers to deeply understand the great significance of improving the cultural and technical level for building socialism. Thus, establish the view of valuing culture and technology and respecting scientific and technical talents in the enterprise, inspire the worker masses' consciousness of learning culture and technology, and encourage their enthusiasm for actively mastering new technologies. It is very wrong to think that workers "study technology just to earn more money" and criticize it as "economism." Old technical workers are the backbone of the technical force among the worker masses and have rich experience in production technology. The Party organization and administration must fully respect their practical operating experience and help them summarize and improve this experience, listen to their opinions with an open mind, and value their suggestions. However, some enterprise workers see that some old workers are not very willing to participate in social activities or do not like to speak at meetings, and think that they are "advanced in production and backward in politics," and take a cold or exclusive attitude towards them, which is also very wrong. The Party organization should educate the broad masses of workers to humbly learn scientific and technical knowledge from engineering and technical personnel, especially to sincerely and earnestly study the advanced technical experience of the Soviet Union, and conscientiously implement the suggestions of Soviet experts. At the same time, the Party organization should help engineering and technical personnel continuously improve their political level and professional technical ability, and educate them to go deep into practice, contact the masses, so as to better combine their scientific and technical knowledge with the labor experience of the worker masses; and learn the advanced technology of the Soviet Union. The Party organization should vigorously cultivate the growth of new technical forces among the worker masses, and struggle against all the bad phenomena of belittling science and technology, undermining the enthusiasm of the worker masses to learn culture and technology, and being indifferent to improving the cultural and technical level of workers. The Party organization should support rationalization proposals and useful inventions and creations among the workers and staff.

    Caring for the political and cultural and technical growth of the working class and caring for their material interests are two aspects of one issue.

    We know that the Five-Year Plan, centered on the development of heavy industry, requires a large amount of construction funds to be invested for a long time, and these funds must be obtained through internal accumulation in our country. Therefore, educating the broad masses of workers to consciously implement a strict system of thrift, establish a hard-working and overcoming difficulties ideological style, and eliminate and eliminate all waste phenomena, so as to use the limited funds for the country's construction cause, is of extreme importance for realizing the First Five-Year Plan and building a socialist society. At the same time, we also know that the ultimate goal of the people's revolution and socialist construction is to continuously improve the material and cultural living standards of the people. What is the correct relationship between these two? That is, the improvement of people's lives must be based on the development of production and the improvement of labor productivity. That is to say, the improvement of life must be subordinate to the development of production. Therefore, if we depart from the basis of production development and improvement of labor productivity, and put forward excessively high demands for living welfare, it is putting the cart before the horse. It should be recognized that without today's hard work, there can be no future happy life. Long-term interests and common interests are always higher than immediate interests and individual interests. We must educate the worker masses to unify the two. If we oppose the two, or only demand to satisfy immediate interests and individual interests, it will only seriously harm the interests of the entire working class and harm the cause of socialist construction. Therefore, we must oppose the tendency to depart from the basis of production development and disregard the current possible conditions to put forward excessively high demands for living welfare, as well as the tendency to only emphasize material interests and ignore political and ideological education. At present, in some enterprises, many standard-high or even luxurious employee dormitories, clubs, nurseries, sanatoriums, and other welfare facilities are built prematurely, and a large amount of funds are used to purchase luxurious clothing, props, musical instruments, etc. for employees' amateur cultural and recreational activities, which is a concrete manifestation of this tendency. Some Party organizations and trade union organizations even fail to advocate practicing thrift, hard work, and subordinating to the national plan, but cater to the backward thinking of some workers, and this practice of putting the cart before the horse does not conform to the long-term interests and overall interests of the working class, and therefore, must be opposed.

    However, this does not mean that we can ignore the material interests of the worker masses. On the contrary, we must always pay enough attention to the material interests of the worker masses.

    In the past, some people put forward slogans such as "three million behind the red flag." This kind of practice of using material interests to encourage the masses without regard to politics is certainly wrong and should be criticized and corrected. But if we only talk about political education without regard to material interests, it is equally one-sided. Some of our comrades do not understand that the worker masses' concern for their labor results from their own material interests is an important factor in promoting production development and also one of the management principles of socialist enterprises. Therefore, they hold an erroneous view of the material interests of the worker masses. They believe that as long as the worker masses put forward demands for material interests, it is "economism." Thus, they use the excuse of "opposing economism among the workers" to erase all demands related to material interests among the workers. When the worker masses put forward certain demands for material interests, they question the masses: "Do you want long-term interests or immediate interests?" "Do you want industrialization or welfare?" In the eyes of these comrades, the long-term interests and immediate interests of the workers, industrialization and welfare, are completely opposed. Because of this, some workers are clearly reluctant to raise their opinions, and some grassroots cadres are also reluctant to talk about the material interests of the workers for fear of being said to be "tailism" or "reflecting backward emotions." Thus, an artificial barrier is created between the enterprise leadership and the workers, and the bureaucracy in the enterprise leadership work is often concealed.

    In our country, are the long-term interests and immediate interests of the workers really irreconcilable opposites? Let's see how Stalin answered this question. Stalin said: "There is no and should not be irreconcilable opposition between the individual and the collective, between individual interests and collective interests. There should not be this opposition, because collectivism and socialism do not deny individual interests, but combine individual interests with collective interests. Socialism cannot be separated from individual interests. Only a socialist society can give the fullest satisfaction to this individual interest." (Stalin's conversation with British writer Wells) Comrades who inappropriately emphasize the opposition between current interests and long-term interests, and between industrialization and material welfare, are actually distorting the basic economic laws of socialism and violating Comrade Mao Zedong's important instruction that while implementing the campaign to increase production and practice thrift, we must pay attention to the safety, health, and necessary welfare undertakings of employees. It is wrong if we only pay attention to the former aspect and ignore or slightly ignore the latter aspect.

    At the same time, it must also be seen that among the opinions and demands put forward by the worker masses from their own material interests, although there may be some that are not completely reasonable and cannot be done under the current conditions, many of them are reasonable and completely feasible. For example, some enterprises have egalitarian tendencies in the implementation of wage policies, unreasonable work quotas, poor implementation of labor protection policies, excessive occupation of workers' spare time, poor worker cafeterias, leaky worker housing, etc. The workers are very dissatisfied with these phenomena and demand that they be resolved. Can it be said that these opinions are not correct? Can it be said that this is a reaction to the backward thinking of the workers for their personal interests? We should never use various excuses to block the opinions and voices of the worker masses, and we should never let the correct criticisms and reasonable suggestions of the worker masses be drowned in the quagmire of bureaucracy.

    Not caring for the worker masses or not caring enough for the worker masses is often caused by the lack of close contact between some leading workers and the worker masses. The Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the working class, and the leading cadres of the Party have the obligation to directly contact the workers, to often talk with the worker masses, to listen to their opinions and voices, to understand their ideological and living conditions, and to conscientiously learn from the worker masses. Industrial construction is a new work and an extremely arduous task, so the busyness and tension of the work are completely understandable. But if you are so busy that you don't even have time to meet with the worker masses, so busy that you don't discuss things with the worker masses, so busy that you become alienated from the feelings of the worker masses, and so busy that you turn a deaf ear to the opinions and voices of the worker masses, and are indifferent to the demands of the worker masses, then what is the meaning of this busyness? Some workers have accumulated opinions for a long time, but do not get the opportunity to reflect them. Some workers, when their reasonable suggestions are suppressed and their correct criticisms of the shortcomings of the leadership work are attacked, want to find the responsible comrades to appeal in person, but often cannot find their way in. Should this intolerable situation continue? Our Party has a long tradition of mass work, and this excellent tradition must be carried forward in industrial and mining enterprises. At the same time, it must be pointed out that some of our comrades often regard a working method that is detached from the masses as a correct working method, such as being accustomed to making long and monotonous reports to the worker masses, and using various meetings to encroach on the worker's spare time and deprive them of their rights to study and rest. It should be seen that due to excessive occupation of workers' spare time and too many meetings, the workers' fatigue has been increased, so that some workers cannot concentrate on production, and do not have enough time to study, which affects the workers' normal family life and physical health. This situation should not continue. Our Party's mass work has a valuable experience, which is to be good at doing meticulous ideological education work to individuals, that is, to be good at conducting in-depth and specific individual work according to the different ideological situations of different objects. We must not only do general calls, but more importantly, we must learn to do the work of individual guidance. Only by adopting the working method of treating them differently and conducting individual activities can we maintain the flesh-and-blood connection between our Party and the worker masses.

    Giving warm and comprehensive care to the worker masses, closely linking the Party with the masses, and giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class is an inexhaustible source of strength in the great historical cause of building socialism by successfully realizing the First Five-Year Plan. Our enemies most hope that we will become detached from the masses, and all hostile elements are looking for gaps in our detachment from the masses to survive and develop. Therefore, we must always keep in mind Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction that we should never be separated from the masses.

    必须全面地关心工人群众
    童大林　李侃
    我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，是一个伟大的计划，是中国共产党领导全国人民为实现过渡时期的总路线而奋斗的带有决定意义的纲领。在为实现五年计划的斗争中，高度地发挥全国工人阶级的积极性和创造性，具有头等重要的意义。
    过去几年来，遵循着党的七届二中全会所规定的“依靠工人阶级，发展生产”这条根本方针，我国工业的恢复和发展获得了巨大的成就。今后我们仍然必须坚持这一根本方针，因为只有依靠工人阶级，才能保证这一伟大的五年计划的胜利完成。
    依靠工人阶级，就是要依靠工人阶级在劳动中的积极性、创造性和集体英雄主义。要从根本上改变我国经济技术落后的状态，完成建设社会主义这样空前伟大的历史事业，没有工人阶级和全体劳动人民自觉地积极地参加和进行奋不顾身的英勇劳动，那是不可想像的。因此，首先从政治上和文化技术上，从物质利益和日常生活的各个方面，对工人群众予以热情的、全面的和无微不至的关怀，不断地提高工人阶级的共产主义觉悟和文化技术水平，发挥广大工人群众的生产积极性和创造性，就成为依靠工人阶级的主要内容，也是在建设社会主义的伟大斗争中，我们党在工矿企业工作中毫无例外地必须遵循的一项重要原则。
    关心工人群众的共产主义思想觉悟的提高，应是我们党的工作的一个基本出发点。工人阶级是不能自发产生社会主义意识的，因此就必须经常地向工人群众宣传马克思列宁主义，经常地对工人群众进行爱国主义和国际主义的教育，经常以党的总路线和党的各项重大政策来教育工人群众，使他们逐渐克服资产阶级和小生产者的思想影响，成为自觉的为建设社会主义而奋斗的积极战士。
    几年来的实践经验告诉我们，向工人群众进行共产主义思想教育，必须紧密结合当前的阶级斗争。也就是说：如果不从过渡时期阶级斗争的实际情况出发，去提高工人阶级的政治觉悟和革命警惕性，如果不用阶级斗争的观点去教育工人群众坚决地肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，如果不同一切侵袭到工人群众中的资产阶级思想作斗争，或是离开了工业生产建设的实践所提出的种种实际问题，离开工人群众中的先进思想同保守落后思想的斗争，那末这种所谓政治思想教育，就会变成令人烦厌的说教，就会缺乏生气，软弱无力。
    提高工人群众的共产主义思想觉悟，必须采取耐心的启发教育的方法，斯大林说过，说服方法是党领导本阶级的基本方法。在思想教育工作中更必须严格遵守这一原则。但是，过去一个时期，曾经有些同志，他们在对工人群众进行政治思想教育时，不是耐心地启发和诱导，而是采取“扣帽子”“突击运动”以及单纯的指责处罚等错误的方法。他们不是把部分工人在对待劳动、对待公共财产以及对待社会生活与家庭生活上的某些落后思想和不正当行为，看做是旧社会和资产阶级思想影响的结果，不是把克服这些落后思想看做是一个艰苦的耐心的教育过程，而往往把有上述缺点的工人群众当做斗争对象，用简单粗暴的办法进行“批判”。有些厂矿对劳动纪律松弛，产品质量低劣等现象，不是实事求是地进行具体的分析研究，不是首先从企业领导上，从经营管理及思想作风上去进行检查，进行自我批评，找出产生缺点和错误的根源和改进的办法，而是把一切过错，都归咎于工人群众，对工人群众发出种种责难，给工人群众扣上各色各样的“帽子”，指责工人这也不是，那也不是，仿佛厂矿工作中的许多缺点和过失，领导上没有多大责任，而只是由于工人群众“思想落后”所造成的。应该指出，这是违反说服教育原则、打击工人政治热情的做法，是低估工人阶级的觉悟程度，降低或否认党对工人阶级的领导作用和教育力量的表现。实际上是漠视了作为现代社会最先进的力量和在我国实现社会主义革命的唯一领导阶级——工人阶级的无限能力和崇高品质。
    几年来的经验证明，企业中的党组织，必须善于以工人阶级的先进思想和工人群众中的模范人物的先进事例，来吸引广大工人群众前进，来启发工人中的落后部分自觉地向先进部分学习，这乃是对工人群众进行教育的一种基本的最有效的方法。可惜，这个方法却往往被某些人们所遗忘或严重忽视了。
    坚持党对待工人群众的说服教育的原则，这并不是说要取消在工人阶级内部开展同志式的批评和自我批评，批评和自我批评永远是工人阶级内部最有力的思想武器，也是说服教育的基本方法。我们知道，在工人阶级队伍中，是存在着先进部分、中间部分和落后部分之分的。特别是随着我国工业建设的发展，新的成份不断地涌进工人阶级队伍中来，他们中间的一些人不可避免地要带来一些资产阶级和小生产者的思想影响，而原有的部分工人群众，也同社会上的小生产者保有千丝万缕的联系，因之，为着要把工人阶级锻炼成为具有高度阶级觉悟和高度组织性、纪律性的战斗队伍，就必须在工人阶级内部展开同志式的批评和自我批评，而对那些犯有严重错误又屡教不改的分子，按情节轻重，分别给以适当的行政处分也是完全必要的。因为这种行政处分，是工人阶级的大多数对个别人的强制，并且这种强制也是以说服教育为前提和基础的。有些同志对这个问题也还缺乏正确的认识。他们以为，既然要强调坚持说服教育的原则，那末对工人中的不管什么人，也不管在什么样情况下，都不能有一点强制，或者是以“群众观点”和害怕犯“官僚主义”、“惩办主义”的错误为借口，而对工人中个别的严重破坏劳动纪律，损害国家财产的分子，甚至对混入工人阶级队伍的反革命分子的破坏活动，也听之任之，不做严肃的处理。这种作法也是错误的，因为它损害了工人阶级和国家的利益，是一种“尾巴主义”的表现。它同党的群众观点毫无相同之处。
    关心工人群众文化技术水平的提高，这是工矿企业中党的政治思想工作的一项重要的内容。任何轻视文化技术或把文化技术同政治对立起来的观点都是极端错误的和有害的。
    曾经有过一个时期，有些工矿企业提出过“反对单纯技术观点”这样的口号，个别企业的某些同志甚至认为“学习技术就是忽视政治”。我们应该反对忽视政治倾向，但决不能反对学习技术钻研技术，而且钻研技术也并不一定就会忽视政治。这些提法之所以错误，就是因为它把政治同技术对立起来。应该认识，不提高工人阶级的文化技术水平，不壮大我国的技术力量，就不能保证第一个五年计划的顺利执行，就会阻碍社会主义建设事业的顺利前进。由于旧中国经济技术的极端落后，给政治上勇敢坚强的中国工人阶级带来了文化技术水平落后的弱点，这正是我们从事社会主义建设的一个很大的困难。党的任务就是要大力提倡和重视文化技术，来逐步消除这个弱点，使工人阶级成为不仅是具有高度共产主义觉悟，而且是能够掌握近代科学技术的建设大军。
    党应该教育企业的干部和广大工人群众，深刻认识提高文化技术水平对建设社会主义的重大意义。从而在企业中树立起重视文化技术，尊重科学技术人材的观点，启发工人群众学习文化技术的自觉性，鼓励他们积极掌握新技术的热情。那种认为工人“学习技术就是为了多挣钱”，而当作“经济主义思想”加以批判的做法是非常错误的。老技术工人，是工人群众中技术力量的骨干，有着丰富的生产技术经验，党组织和行政必须十分尊重他们的实际操作经验，并帮助他们总结提高这方面的经验，虚心倾听他们的意见和重视他们的建议。但是有些企业工作者看到有些老工人不大愿意参加社会活动或开会时不爱发言，就认为他们是“生产先进，政治落后”，而对他们采取冷淡或排斥的态度，这也是十分不对的。党组织要教育广大工人群众，虚心地向工程技术人员学习科学技术知识，特别是要诚心诚意地努力学习苏联的先进技术经验，认真执行苏联专家的建议。党组织同时要帮助工程技术人员不断地提高政治水平和业务技术能力，教育他们深入实际，联系群众，以便更好地把自己的科学技术知识和工人群众的劳动经验结合起来；并学习苏联先进技术。党组织应该大力培养工人群众中新生技术力量的成长，向一切轻视科学技术、打击工人群众学习文化技术的积极性和对提高工人文化技术水平漠不关心的恶劣现象作斗争。党组织要支持职工群众中合理化建议和有用的发明创造。
    关心工人阶级在政治上、文化技术上的成长和关心他们的物质利益，这是一个问题的两个方面。
    我们知道，以发展重工业为中心的五年计划，是需要长期地投入大量的建设资金的，而这些资金又是要依靠我国内部积累来取得的。因此，教育广大工人群众，自觉地实行严格的节约制度，树立艰苦奋斗、克服困难的思想作风，消除和杜绝一切浪费现象，以便把有限的资金用在国家的建设事业上，这对实现第一个五年计划和建设社会主义社会有着极端重要的意义。同时我们也还知道，人民革命和社会主义建设的最高目的，就是要不断地提高人民的物质和文化生活水平。这二者之间的正确关系是什么呢？那就是人民生活的提高，必须建立在生产发展和劳动生产率提高的基础上，也就是说，生活的提高必须服从生产的发展。因此，如果离开生产的发展和劳动生产率提高的基础，提出过高的生活福利的要求那就是本末倒置。应该认识，没有今天的艰苦奋斗，就不可能有将来的幸福生活。长远利益和共同利益任何时候都是高于眼前利益和个人利益的。我们必须教育工人群众把两者统一起来。如果把两者对立起来，或者只要求满足眼前利益和个人利益，那就只能严重地损害整个工人阶级的利益，损害社会主义建设的事业。因此，我们就必须反对那种离开生产发展的基础，不顾当前的可能条件，提出过高的生活福利要求的偏向，以及只强调物质利益，而忽视政治思想教育的偏向。目前，有些企业中，过早的修建许多标准过高的甚至是豪华的职工宿舍、俱乐部、托儿所、疗养院以及其他福利设施，用大批款项为职工的业余文娱活动购置奢华的服装、道具、乐器等等，就是这种偏向的具体表现。有些党组织和工会组织甚至不去提倡厉行节约、艰苦奋斗，服从国家计划，而去迁就某些工人的落后思想，这种本末倒置的作法是不符合工人阶级的长远利益和整体利益的，因之，必须受到反对。
    但是，这丝毫也不是说，我们就可以不去关心工人群众的物质利益，恰恰相反，我们必须时时刻刻对工人群众的物质利益予以足够的关心。
    过去曾有人提出“红旗后面三百万”这类口号，这种脱离政治用物质利益去鼓舞群众的作法当然是错误的，应该加以批判和纠正。但是如果撇开了物质利益，只谈政治教育，也同样是片面的。我们有些同志，不懂得工人群众从物质利益上关心自己的劳动成果，是推动生产发展的一个重要因素，也是社会主义企业的管理原则之一，因之他们对工人群众的物质利益抱着一种错误的看法，他们认为工人群众只要提出物质利益的要求，就是“经济主义思想”，于是就借口“反对工人中的经济主义思想”来抹杀工人中一切有关物质利益的要求。当工人群众提出某些物质利益要求时，他们就质问群众：“要长远利益，还是要眼前利益”，“要工业化，还是要福利”。在这些同志看来，工人的长远利益和眼前利益，工业化和福利乃是完全对立的东西。正因为这样，有些工人明明有意见也不愿意再提了，有些基层干部也因为害怕说是“尾巴主义”、“反映落后情绪”而缄口不谈工人的物质利益的要求。于是就在企业领导和工人之间造成一种人为的障壁，企业领导工作中的官僚主义往往被掩盖了。
    在我们国家里，工人的长远利益和眼前利益，真是不可调和的对立吗？请看斯大林是怎样回答这个问题的吧，斯大林说：“个人和集体之间、个人利益和集体利益之间是没有而且也不应当有不可调和的对立的。不应当有这种对立，因为集体主义、社会主义并不否认个人利益，而是把个人利益与集体利益结合起来。社会主义是不能撇开个人利益的。只有社会主义社会才能给这种个人利益以最充分的满足。”（斯大林与英国作家威尔斯的谈话）不恰当地强调目前利益同长远利益、工业化同物质福利对立的同志，实际上是对社会主义基本经济规律的歪曲，是违反了毛泽东同志关于在实施增产节约运动的同时，必须注意职工的安全、健康和必不可少的福利事业，如果只注意前一方面，忽视或稍加忽视后一方面，都是错误的这一重要指示的。
    同时还必须看到，工人群众从他们的切身物质利益出发所提出的意见和要求，其中固然会有一些不尽合理和在目前条件下还做不到的，但其中有不少是合情合理也完全能够办到的。例如某些企业在执行工资政策中有平均主义的倾向，工时定额不合理，劳动保护政策贯彻得不好，占用工人业余时间过多，工人食堂办得很糟，工人住房漏雨等等，工人对这些现象很不满意，要求给以解决。这难道能说这些意见不正确吗？能说这是工人为着个人利益的落后思想的反应吗？绝不应该用各种借口堵塞工人群众的意见和呼声，绝不应该让工人群众的正确批评和合理建议淹没在官僚主义的泥潭中。
    不关心工人群众或是对工人群众关心不够，往往是由于若干领导工作人员没有和工人群众保持密切联系所造成的。中国共产党是工人阶级的先锋队，党的领导干部有义务去同工人直接接触，经常同工人群众进行谈话，听取他们的意见和呼声，了解他们的思想情况和生活情况，并认真地向工人群众学习。工业建设，这是新的工作，是极为繁重的任务，因此工作的繁忙紧张是完全可以理解的。但是如果忙得同工人群众见面的时候也没有、忙得有事不同工人群众商量、忙得对工人群众的感情疏远起来、忙得对工人群众的意见和呼声充耳不闻，对工人群众的要求漠不关心，那末，这种忙又有什么意义呢？有些工人积了长时期的意见，但得不到反映的机会，有些工人当他们的合理建议被压制，对领导工作缺点的正确批评被打击的时候，想找负责同志当面申诉，却往往不得其门而入。难道这种不能容许的情况还应该继续下去吗？我们党有着长时期的群众工作的传统，在工矿企业中必须发扬这种优良的传统。同时，必须指出，我们有些同志常常把一种脱离群众的工作方法当作正确的工作方法，比如，习惯于向工人群众作长篇而又千篇一律的报告，以这样那样的会议来侵占工人的业余时间，剥夺他们的学习和休息的权利等等。应该看到，由于占用工人业余时间过多，会议过多，已经增加了工人的疲劳，使有些工人不能聚精会神地进行生产，也没有充分的时间进行学习，影响了工人正常的家庭生活和身体健康，这种情况是不应该再继续下去了。我们党的群众工作有一条宝贵的经验，就是要善于向个别人做细致的思想教育工作，也就是要善于针对不同对象的不同思想情况进行深入的具体的个别工作。我们不仅要做好一般号召，更重要的要学会做个别指导的工作，只有采取分别对待、个别活动的工作方法，才能保持我们党同工人群众的血肉联系。
    对工人群众予以热情地全面地关怀，密切党同群众的联系，发挥工人阶级的积极性和创造性，乃是胜利地实现第一个五年计划建设社会主义伟大历史事业中取之不竭的力量泉源。我们的敌人就最希望我们脱离群众，一切敌对分子都在寻找我们脱离群众的空隙求得生存和发展。因此，我们必须时刻牢记毛泽东同志谆谆告戒我们的一刻也不脱离群众的指示。
