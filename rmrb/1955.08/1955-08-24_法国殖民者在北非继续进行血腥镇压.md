　　Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd: Casablanca dispatch: The large-scale bloodshed caused by the French colonialists' frantic slaughter of local residents continues in Morocco and Algeria. According to United Press International, these days are "the bloodiest and darkest days since French rule in North Africa."
  
  According to reports, on August 20, French colonial troops killed 1,000 Arabs in Algeria who rose up against French rule. On the same day, clashes resulting from the French army's suppression of large-scale demonstrations by Moroccans demanding national independence resulted in 503 deaths and 223 injuries, the vast majority of whom were Moroccans. In recent days, the number of Moroccans and Algerians slaughtered by French colonialists has continued to increase. Currently, French colonialists are using further repressive actions to deal with the struggle of the Algerian and Moroccan people for national independence. After the Algerian People's Armed Forces attacked the Oued Zenati municipality in Constantine Province on the 20th, the French army arrested 600 people in Oued Zenati that same day. On the 22nd, the French army surrounded nine large villages in Oued Zenati, drove out all the residents, and completely razed the nine villages to the ground with artillery.

　　On the 20th and 21st, Moroccan people had armed conflicts with French colonialists in Oud Cheham and Khenifra, 100 miles southeast of Casablanca. On the 22nd, French authorities dispatched aircraft and tanks to cover the French Foreign Legion's encirclement of Oud Cheham, searching the homes of local residents, some of whom continued to resist inside their homes.

　　Currently, the French government is continuing to airlift troops and military supplies from the country to Morocco and Algeria. On the evening of the 21st, two battalions of French troops were airlifted to Casablanca.

　　The atrocities of the French colonialists have aroused even stronger indignation among the Moroccan and Algerian people. On the 21st, 40,000 Moroccans lined the streets of Casablanca to mourn the 35 compatriots killed by the French army.

　　法国殖民者在北非继续进行血腥镇压
    新华社二十三日讯　卡萨布兰卡消息：由于法国殖民者疯狂屠杀当地居民而造成的大流血仍在摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚继续中。据合众社说：这几天是“法国统治北非以来最血腥和黑暗的日子。”
  据消息说，在八月二十日，法国殖民军队在阿尔及利亚杀死了一千个起来反抗法国统治的阿拉伯人。同一天，由于法国军队镇压摩洛哥人要求民族独立的大示威而造成的冲突中，有五百零三人死亡，二百二十三人受伤，其中绝大多数是摩洛哥人。这几天来，遭法国殖民者屠杀的摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚人的数目还在不断增加。现在，法国殖民者正在以进一步的镇压行动对付对阿尔及利亚和摩洛哥人民要求民族独立的斗争。在阿尔及利亚人民武装部队二十日攻击了君士坦丁省的乌埃泽纳蒂市政厅以后，当天，法国军队就在乌埃泽纳蒂逮捕了六百人。二十二日，法国军队又包围了乌埃泽纳蒂的九个大村庄，把全部居民赶走，用大炮把九个村庄完全轰成平地。
    摩洛哥人民在二十日和二十一日在卡萨布兰卡东南一百英里的欧德柴姆和肯尼弗拉同法国殖民者发生了武装冲突。二十二日，法国当局出动了飞机和坦克，掩护着法国的外籍军团包围了欧德柴姆，对当地居民的房屋进行搜查，有些当地居民继续在房屋内进行抵抗。
    目前，法国政府还在继续从国内空运军队和军事物资到摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚去。二十一日晚间就有两营法国军队被空运到卡萨布兰卡。
    法国殖民者的暴行激起了摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚人民更加强烈的愤慨。二十一日有四万摩洛哥人排列在卡萨布兰卡街头，给被法国军队杀害的三十五个同胞送葬。
