Observer's Commentary

    For several years, the U.S. government has been using crude methods to obstruct Chinese students from returning to their country. It has spared no effort in threatening and persecuting Chinese students, even detaining and interrogating those who wish to return, and imposing fines.

    However, the U.S. State Department has repeatedly claimed that since early April of this year, the U.S. government has "lifted" the restrictions on the departure of some Chinese students who had previously applied to leave the country; Chinese students no longer need to apply and are free to leave. As recently as August 19th, the Associated Press reported that U.S. officials said that although some Chinese students had been restricted at one time, they have been free to leave since April 8th.

    The statements of the U.S. State Department and the reports of the Associated Press irrefutably confirm the fact that the U.S. government did indeed openly "restrict" Chinese students who wanted to return to their country, preventing them from returning to their homeland. However, the U.S. says that since April of this year, this "restriction" no longer exists, and any Chinese student who wishes to return can "freely" return to their country.

    Of course, we welcome the U.S. statement that Chinese students in the U.S. are free to return home. The question is whether this statement is consistent with the actual situation.

    Since April of this year, have Chinese students in the U.S. been able to leave the U.S. “freely” and return to their homeland? If the "freedom" referred to by U.S. officials has the same meaning as freedom generally understood, then the process of returning to China for Chinese students who have been wanting to return for years should be very smooth, and they should have all returned long ago. However, the facts are not like this. From the recent talks given by returning Chinese students from the U.S., people can clearly see that they had to exert all their efforts to break free from the iron grip of the U.S. Immigration Bureau to return to their country. The most typical example is Mr. Xie Jialin. According to these students' statements, there are many other students like them who cannot break free from the iron grip of the U.S. Immigration Bureau and are still unable to leave the United States. The most typical example of this is Mr. Qian Xuesen. From 1950 until now, his family is still waiting for him to return.

    The U.S. officials' statement that Chinese students are free to return home, to say the least, completely lacks a sense of humor; they do not realize how contradictory and ridiculous they have made themselves. Since it is a free return home, then there are no restrictions, as U.S. officials themselves have said. According to a report from Washington by the Associated Press on the 20th, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles even announced that Chinese students are free to leave the United States at any time they wish. If this is the case, then why restrict them to leave within an extremely short period of time when it is impossible to make good preparations for departure? The U.S. Immigration Bureau knows that before Chinese students can leave the country, they must raise travel expenses, complete various departure procedures, and some must also deal with issues such as unfinished studies, unexpired employment contracts, and arrangements for family members and children, all of which require sufficient time to handle. Knowing this, limiting them to leave within two weeks is intentionally increasing the difficulty for Chinese students to return home. More seriously, if they cannot leave as scheduled, they will suffer the torment of the so-called "deportation proceedings," including physical pain, financial losses, and mental oppression such as detention, bail, and interrogation. After Chinese students are placed in such a predicament, the U.S. authorities tell them that if they want to avoid this torment, they should apply for permanent residency or apply for political asylum according to the so-called "U.S. Refugee Relief Act of 1953."

    From this perspective, what freedom do Chinese students in the U.S. actually have to return home?

    To force Chinese students to apply for permanent residency or political asylum to achieve the goal of preventing them from returning to their country, the U.S. government also takes various other measures. After receiving a notice of limited time to leave the country, the U.S. Immigration Bureau often summons students who apply to return home and asks them questions unrelated to the U.S., such as "Why do you want to go back?" and "What do you think of the Communist Party?" forcing them to express their political views. The answers to these questions are recorded, signed by the person, and sworn to be true. The Immigration Bureau and the FBI can at any time accuse Chinese students of "perjury" by claiming that their previous answers are inconsistent. Even on the way back to China, Chinese students are threatened and obstructed from all sides. The recent experience of Xie Jialin, who returned to China, is a representative example. He boarded a ship in San Francisco on July 9th to return to China. When he learned on the way that his relatives in the United States were ill and inquired with the U.S. Immigration Bureau whether he could visit them, the reactionary U.S. newspapers took the opportunity to spread various rumors. When Xie Jialin passed through Yokohama, Manila, and Hong Kong, U.S. embassy personnel and Chiang Kai-shek's clique tried every means to obstruct him. U.S. embassy personnel in Manila even openly stated that if Xie Jialin was willing to abandon his intention to return to his country and was willing to return to the United States, then he could land in Manila or Hong Kong, and they would handle all the procedures. Why was Xie Jialin subjected to all kinds of difficulties when he left the United States, but it would be so simple and convenient if he wanted to return to the United States?

    It can be seen from this that the claim that Chinese students in the U.S. are "free" to leave the U.S. and return home is completely inconsistent with the facts. In fact, since the U.S.'s so-called ban on restricting return to the country was "lifted," Chinese students are not only still being restricted from leaving the United States, but are also being detained in the United States in disguise.

    Mr. Qian Xuesen's experience in the United States can fully prove this. The famous Chinese scientist Qian Xuesen had been preparing to return to China since August 1950, but he was illegally arrested by the U.S. authorities and detained without cause for as long as fifteen days. Since then, he has been in an extremely unreasonable state. The New York Times reported on March 6, 1953: "Dr. Qian Xuesen is under a deportation order, leaving the United States for China; but he has also received an order not to leave the United States." He not only cannot leave the United States, but also cannot leave the boundary of the county where he lives. This situation has not changed because the United States "lifted" the so-called ban on restricting departure. Precisely because of this, on June 15th of this year, two months after the United States "lifted" the ban on restrictions, Qian Xuesen had to write a letter to Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, requesting assistance in returning to his country. In the letter, Qian Xuesen said: "Being detained by the U.S. government for five years now, not a day, not an hour, not a moment do I not think of returning to my country to participate in the great construction upsurge."

    Faced with these facts, people cannot help but draw the conclusion that the U.S. government's restrictions on Chinese students wishing to return home have not actually been lifted; the situation of Chinese students being restricted from returning has not fundamentally changed. If there has been any change in the current situation compared to the past, then the change is only that the U.S. authorities have adopted more covert methods. It believes that this method can both achieve the goal of obstructing Chinese students from returning to their country and also completely shirk the responsibility of the U.S. authorities.

    But this cannot be done. There is a Chinese saying: One hand cannot cover the eyes and ears of everyone in the world. The U.S. government should prove its words with actions.

### 留美学生有什么回国自由

    留美学生有什么回国自由
    几年以来，美国政府一直采取粗暴的手段，阻挠我国留学生返国。它不惜对我国留学生进行种种威胁和迫害，甚至对要求返国的我国留学生加以拘留审讯和课以罚金。
    但是，最近美国国务院一再声称，自今年四月初以来，美国政府已经“取消”了对于一些早就提出过离境申请的中国留学生的离境限制；中国留学生都用不着申请可以自由离境。直到本月十九日，美联社还作了这样的报道：美国官员说，虽然中国留学生中间某些人曾经有一度受到限制，但是从四月八日以后，他们一直是可以自由离开的。
    美国国务院的表示和美联社的报道，都无可辩驳地证实了这样的事实：对于要求回国的我国留学生，美国政府的确曾经公开加以“限制”，不许他们回到自己的祖国。不过美国说，自从今年四月以来，这种“限制”已经不存在了，任何一个要求回国的中国留学生，都可以“自由”地返回自己的祖国了。
    当然，对于美国所作的中国留学生已可自由回国的声明，我们是表示欢迎的。问题是在于这种声明同实际情况是否相符。
    从今年四月以来，中国留美学生是否能够
  “自由”离开美国，回返祖国呢？美国官员所谓的“自由”如果是同一般所了解的自由的含义一样，那末，要求回国有几年之久的我国留美学生离美回国的过程应该是很顺利，他们也应该早已全部回来了。然而事实却并不是这样。从最近回国留美学生发表的谈话中，人们清清楚楚地看到，他们都费尽了九牛二虎之力，才挣脱了美国移民局的铁掌，回到祖国。其中最典型的例子是谢家麟先生。根据这些学生们的谈话，还有许许多多和他们同样的留学生，挣不脱美国移民局的铁掌，至今离不开美国。其中最典型的例子是钱学森先生。从一九五○年起直到现在，他的家人还盼不到他的踪影。
    美国官员说中国学生可以自由回国的说法，从最轻的意义讲，是完全失掉了幽默感的，他们不知道这把他们自己弄得多么自相矛盾，多么可笑。既然是自由回国，那就是没有限制，这也是美国官员们自己讲的。根据美联社二十日来自华盛顿的报道，美国国务卿杜勒斯还宣布过：中国学生有自由在他们所希望的任何时候离开美国。既是这样，那末，为什么又要限制他们在不可能作好离境准备的极短期间离境呢？美国移民局明知我国留学生在离境以前，必须筹集旅费、办好种种离境手续，有些人还因为学业没有结业、职业合同没有期满、家眷孩子需要安排等等原因，都必须有足够的时间来加以处理。明知这样，而限定他们在两星期内离境，这就是有意要增加我国留学生的返国困难。更严重的是，如果他们不能如期离境，就要遭受到所谓“驱逐出境程序”的折磨，包括拘留交保审讯等肉体上的痛苦、金钱上的损失和精神上的压迫。当我国留学生被放到这样的困境中以后，美国当局就告诉他们，若想避免这种折磨，就应该按照所谓“美国一九五三年难民救济法”申请永久居留，或者申请做政治难民。
    从这里看，我国留学生究竟有什么回国自由呢？
    为了逼迫中国留学生申请永久居留或者做政治难民，以达到禁止他们返回祖国的目的，美国政府还采取其他种种办法。申请回国的留学生在接到限期离境的通知后，美国移民局还经常传讯他们，询问一些“为什么要回去？”“对共产党的看法如何？”等等同美国毫不相干的问题，迫使他们表示政治见解。这些问题的答案都被做成记录，由本人签署并宣誓保证真实。移民局和联邦调查局随时可以借故我国留学生历次答复有出入，被控以“伪证罪”。甚至在我国留学生的回国启程途中，还受到来自各方面的威胁和阻挠。最近归国的谢家麟的遭遇，就是一个具有代表性的例子。他在七月九日自旧金山搭船回国，当他在途中得知他的亲属在美国得病，因而向美国移民局询问可否前往探视时，美国反动报刊即乘机散布种种谣言。当谢家麟途经横滨、马尼拉、香港时，美国使馆人员和蒋贼集团人员还千方百计地加以阻挠。美国驻马尼拉使馆人员竟公然表示：假如谢家麟愿意放弃返回祖国的意愿，愿意返回美国，那末可以在马尼拉或者香港登陆，一切手续由他办理。为什么谢家麟离开美国时受到百般刁难，而如果他要返回美国时却又那么简单方便呢？
    由此可见，所谓中国留美学生已可“自由”离美回国的说法，是同事实完全不符的。事实上，自美国的所谓限制回国的禁令“取消”以后，中国学生不但是继续被限制离开美国，而且是被变相地扣留在美国。
    钱学森先生在美国的遭遇可以充分证明这一点。著名的中国科学家钱学森自一九五○年八月起即准备回国，但他竟然遭到美国当局的非法逮捕，被无故拘禁达十五天之久。自此之后，他就处在一种极其不合理的状态中。纽约时报一九五三年三月六日报道说：“钱学森博士正受到驱逐出境的命令，离开美国到中国去；但他同时也接到不许离开美国的命令。”他不但不能离开美国，而且不能离开他所住的县的边界。这种情况是并没有因为美国“取消”了所谓限制离境的禁令而有所改变的。正因为如此，所以在今年六月十五日，即美国“取消”了限制禁令之后两个月，钱学森还不得不写信给全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长陈叔通，请求援助他回返祖国。在信里，钱学森说：“被美政府扣留，今已五年，无一日、一时、一刻不思归国，参加伟大的建设高潮。”
    面对着这些事实，人们不能不得出这样的结论：美国政府对中国留学生要求回国的限制实际并未取消；中国留学生被限制返国的情况并无根本改变。如果说，目前的情况与过去相比有所变化，那末变化仅仅是：美国当局采取了更隐蔽的办法。它以为这种办法既能达到阻挠我国留学生回国的目的，又能把美国当局的责任推卸得干干净净。
    但，这是办不到的。中国有句老话：一只手不能掩尽天下人的耳目。美国政府应该拿行动来证明它的言辞。
