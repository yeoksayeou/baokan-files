Xinhua News Agency, August 20th. Fadil Pachrami, head of the Albanian Cultural Delegation, and Lieutenant Colonel Mekur Chailla, leader and head of the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe, delivered radio addresses on the Central People's Broadcasting Station on the 19th.

　　In his speech, Fadil Pachrami said that after the historical victory of the Chinese revolution, the friendly relations between the Albanian and Chinese people have been strengthened year by year. The friendship between the people of China and Albania is a sincere and brotherly friendship, because the people of China and Albania both live in the big family of free people in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and are inspired by common ideals.

　　Fadil Pachrami introduced the situation in Albania before and after liberation, and he explained the significant achievements Albania has made in socialist construction, in both economic and cultural construction. He said that Albania's industrial products have increased eleven times compared to before the war. Agriculture is also developing rapidly, and farmers have joined agricultural production cooperatives. The illiteracy left over from the past has almost been eliminated. Culture, education, science, and art are developing. The children of workers, farmers, and all working people have the opportunity to receive education. The number of existing schools and students is three times more than before the war. He said that all these achievements are due to the wise leadership of the Central Committee of the Labor Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, and also due to the assistance of the great Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

　　Fadil Pachrami said, "We have come here from the distant Adriatic coast to consolidate the friendship between the Albanian and Chinese people." He said that the Albanian people know a lot about the heroic struggle of the Chinese people and the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people. The Albanian people are watching with great pleasure the tremendous achievements of the People's Republic of China in political, economic, and cultural fields, and congratulate the People's Republic of China on the important role it plays in international politics. The Albanian people support the People's Republic of China's demand to liberate Taiwan and participate in the United Nations. He said that when our first cultural delegation returns to Albania, it will introduce to the Albanian people the major achievements made by New China in various fields.

　　In his speech, Lieutenant Colonel Mekur Chailla said that the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe has been invited to visit and perform in Beijing, the capital of China, and major cities for the first time. This will greatly consolidate the friendship between the people and armies of Albania and China.

　　He also introduced the process of the growth and strengthening of the Albanian People's Army. He said that the Albanian People's Army grew and strengthened in the struggle against German and Italian fascists and traitors to the people. During the Second World War, thanks to the Soviet Union's selfless and brotherly great assistance, and thanks to the correct leadership of the Labor Party, their own political party, they finally defeated the fascist invaders.

　　Mekur Chailla said that today, under the leadership of the Labor Party and the government, the Albanian People's Army educates itself with the glorious traditions of the past national liberation struggle and equips itself with the most advanced military technology of the Soviet Union. They resolutely strive to defend the security of the motherland and the peaceful labor of the Albanian people.

　　Mekur Chailla said that the Warsaw Pact guarantees Albania's permanent independence and autonomy, and the Albanian people believe that the Warsaw Pact has the same great significance as the victory of the people's revolution. The fact that the People's Republic of China has declared its approval and support for the Warsaw Pact greatly encourages the Albanian people's confidence in the victory of socialist construction.

　　帕奇拉米和柴拉发表广播讲话
    新华社二十日讯　阿尔巴尼亚文化代表团团长法迪尔·帕奇拉米和阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团领队兼团长梅库尔·柴拉中校，十九日在中央人民广播电台作了广播讲话。
    法迪尔·帕奇拉米在讲话中说，在中国革命取得历史性胜利之后，阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民之间的友好关系在一年年地巩固着。中阿两国人民之间的友谊是真诚的兄弟般的友谊，因为中阿两国人民都是生活在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的自由人民的大家庭里，并且为共同的思想所鼓舞。
    法迪尔·帕奇拉米介绍了阿尔巴尼亚解放前后的情况，他说明了阿尔巴尼亚在进行社会主义建设中，在经济建设和文化建设方面已经取得的重大成就。他说，阿尔巴尼亚的工业产品已比战前增加了十一倍。农业也在迅速地发展，农民都参加了农业生产合作社。过去遗留下的文盲几乎已经被消灭。文化教育科学和艺术正在发展。工人、农民和全体劳动人民的子弟都有机会受教育。现有的学校和学生都比战前多三倍。他说，所有这些成就，是由于以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的劳动党中央委员会的英明领导。还由于有伟大的苏联和人民民主国家的帮助。
    法迪尔·帕奇拉米说，我们从遥远的亚得里亚海岸来到这里，是为了巩固阿中两国人民之间的友谊。他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民对于中国人民的英勇斗争和中国人民的革命事业知道的很多。阿尔巴尼亚人民以极其愉快的心情注视着中华人民共和国在政治、经济和文化方面的巨大的成就，并且祝贺中华人民共和国在国际政治中所起的重大作用。阿尔巴尼亚人民支持中华人民共和国解放台湾和参加联合国的要求。他说，我们第一个文化代表团回到阿尔巴尼亚的时候，要向阿尔巴尼亚人民介绍新中国所取得的各项重大成就。
    梅库尔·柴拉中校在讲话中说，阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团，应邀第一次来中国首都北京和各大城市进行访问演出。这将会大大地巩固阿、中两国人民和军队之间的友谊。
    他又介绍了阿尔巴尼亚人民军的成长和壮大的过程。他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民军是在反对德国、意大利法西斯和人民叛徒的斗争中成长壮大起来的。在第二次世界大战中，由于苏联的无私的兄弟般的巨大援助，由于阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民自己的政党劳动党的正确领导；他们终于战胜了法西斯侵略者。
    梅库尔·柴拉说，今天，在劳动党和政府领导下的阿尔巴尼亚人民军，以过去民族解放斗争的光荣传统教育自己，由苏联最先进的军事技术装备自己，他们坚决地为保卫祖国安全、保卫阿尔巴尼亚人民的和平劳动而奋斗。
    梅库尔·柴拉说，华沙条约保证了阿尔巴尼亚永久的独立、自主，阿尔巴尼亚人民认为华沙条约和人民革命的胜利有同样的重大意义。中华人民共和国声明赞同和支持华沙条约，这个事实就大大鼓舞了阿尔巴尼亚人民建设社会主义的胜利信心。
