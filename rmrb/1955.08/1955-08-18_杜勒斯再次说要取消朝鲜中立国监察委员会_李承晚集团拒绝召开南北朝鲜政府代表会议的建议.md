Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 17th – Washington News: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, answering questions about the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission at a press conference in Washington on the 16th, reiterated the U.S. policy of undermining the basic provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement regarding the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

In his remarks, Dulles denied that the United States had made any commitment to Syngman Rhee regarding "ending the activities of the Armistice Supervisory Commission." However, he said that he "believes that the provisions of the armistice agreement have become outdated in several respects and are being violated. We believe that some modifications in this regard are appropriate, especially concerning the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission." He once again supported Syngman Rhee's view, slandering the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission as not playing a "useful role" and "possibly playing a bad role."

Dulles said that in order to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the U.S. government "has taken some initiative." The United States has not only held frequent talks with the Swiss and Swedish authorities but has also been in talks with "the other sixteen countries of the United Nations Command." He added that the talks have not yet yielded "positive results."

When asked whether the U.S. plan was to "get this commission out of this country (Korea) or to restrict its activities in some way," Dulles indicated that he hoped to achieve so-called "any progress" in either or both aspects.

When discussing the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea, Dulles avoided directly answering the proposals made again by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the government of the People's Republic of China to convene a Far Eastern conference with broad participation of Asian countries to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, insisting that he "cannot see any very practical way to promote the realization of (Korean) unification." Dulles still insisted on the unreasonable plan that had caused the breakdown of the Korean issue negotiations at the 1954 Geneva Conference—that the United Nations supervise elections in Korea, believing that Korean unification could not be resolved without it.

Dulles said regarding the negotiations between the ambassadors of China and the United States in Geneva that the negotiations had "made no significant progress." He also said that he had not yet received a telegram from the U.S. representative Johnsson, who was participating in the negotiations, on that day.

Dulles also spoke at the meeting about the recent Soviet announcement of disarmament, saying that he welcomed the decision, "If this decision is implemented, such action would be in line with the general atmosphere of the Geneva Conference." However, Dulles also attempted to diminish the significance of the Soviet decision, saying that the "military significance of this decision is not easy to determine."

Xinhua News Agency, 17th – Seoul News: South Korean government spokesman Ko Hong-ki issued an official statement on the 16th, rejecting the proposal by Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, to convene a conference of representatives of the North and South Korean governments to discuss the issue of Korean unification.

In its statement, the South Korean government repeated the platitude of so-called "free elections under the supervision of the United Nations" to "unify" Korea, which had already gone bankrupt at the Geneva Conference last year.

### 杜勒斯再次说要取消朝鲜中立国监察委员会  李承晚集团拒绝召开南北朝鲜政府代表会议的建议

    杜勒斯再次说要取消朝鲜中立国监察委员会
    李承晚集团拒绝召开南北朝鲜政府代表会议的建议
    新华社十七日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯十六日在华盛顿记者招待会上解答有关朝鲜中立国监察委员会的问题时，重申美国的政策是要破坏朝鲜停战协定中关于中立国监察委员会的基本条款。
    杜勒斯在谈话中否认美国在“结束停战监察委员会的活动问题上”对李承晚承担了义务，但是，他说，他“认为停战协定的规定在若干方面已经变得过时了而且正在遭受破坏，我们认为在这方面作某些修改是适当的，特别是关于中立国监察委员会。”他再一次支持李承晚的观点，污蔑中立国监察委员会没有起“有益的作用”，而且“可能在起坏作用”。
    杜勒斯说，为了取消中立国监察委员会，美国政府“曾经采取某种主动”。美国不但经常同瑞士和瑞典当局会谈，而且一直还在同“联合国军司令部的其他十六个国家”进行会谈。他又说，会谈到现在还没有获得“肯定的结果”。
    有人问，美国的计划究竟是要“把这个委员会搞出这个国家（朝鲜）呢，还是以某种方法限制它的活动呢”？杜勒斯表示：他希望在这两方面的任何一方面或同时在两方面取得所谓“任何进展”。
    在谈到朝鲜和平统一的问题时，杜勒斯避免正面答复朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国政府再次提出的关于召开有亚洲国家广泛参加的远东会议来和平解决朝鲜问题的建议，硬说现在还“看不出有任何非常切实可行的办法来促使（朝鲜）统一实现”。杜勒斯仍然坚持曾经使一九五四年日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的谈判破裂的不合理方案——由联合国监督朝鲜选举，认为不这样就不能解决朝鲜统一问题。
    杜勒斯在谈到中美两国大使在日内瓦的谈判时说，谈判“没有重大进展”，他又说，他当天还没有收到参加谈判的美国代表约翰逊的电报。
    杜勒斯在会上还谈到苏联最近宣布的裁军决定，他说，他欢迎这一决定，“这一决定如果实现了，这种行动将会符合日内瓦会议的总的气氛。”但是，杜勒斯又企图贬低苏联这一决定的意义，说什么这一决定的“军事意义是不容易断定的”。
    新华社十七日讯　南朝鲜政府发言人葛弘基十六日发表官方声明，拒绝了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成提出的召开南北朝鲜政府代表会议来讨论统一朝鲜问题的建议。
    南朝鲜政府在它的声明中重复早在去年日内瓦会议上就已破产的所谓“在联合国的监督下举行自由选举”来“统一”朝鲜的滥调。
