Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, 7th. In recent years, many junior and senior primary school graduates in Rehe Province have served as directors, accountants, or technicians of agricultural production cooperatives, as well as concurrently serving as rural civil school teachers. According to statistics from the recent congresses of young socialist construction activists held in eleven counties and banners, among the more than 1,300 young socialist construction activists attending the congresses, more than 570 were junior and senior primary school graduates engaged in agricultural production. Shi Guizhi, a female senior primary school graduate from Yangshuwanzi Village, Jianchang County, not only persuaded her grandfather and father, who had withdrawn from the cooperative three times, to rejoin when she returned home to participate in agricultural production last year, but also helped the cooperative train two bookkeepers because she was literate and numerate. She was soon elected as the deputy director of the cooperative and attended the Jianchang County Congress of Young Socialist Construction Activists. Li Qinghuan, a junior high school graduate and member of an agricultural production cooperative in Yangshudixa Village, Kalaqin Left Banner, applied some of the scientific knowledge he learned at school to improve agricultural production. This spring, he opened up an experimental field to conduct experiments on yield-increasing techniques such as grafting gourds and cucumbers, and cowpeas and cucumbers. As a result, the grafted cucumbers yielded more than ordinary cucumbers and were welcomed by other members.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 7th. In the past two years, tens of thousands of junior and senior primary school graduates who have participated in agricultural production in Hubei Province have mostly become important backbone members and activists in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. In Xishui County, 70% of the more than 1,500 junior and senior primary school graduates who participated in agricultural labor have served as presidents, accountants, mutual aid team leaders, and work recorders of agricultural production cooperatives. Guo Baisong, a senior primary school graduate and vice president of a cooperative, and Cen Fuyin, a mutual aid team leader, have diligently studied advanced agricultural techniques and led the farmers in their cooperative and team to promote these advanced experiences, resulting in higher yields for their cooperatives and mutual aid teams than for ordinary farmers in the area. Chen Zhaokun, a senior primary school graduate, joined the Huaguang Second Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shishan Township, District 6, Echeng County, as an accountant last autumn. Because he was willing to study his work diligently, he managed the cooperative's finances very well, came up with many ways to implement savings and reduce non-productive expenditures, and often helped accountants from eighteen cooperatives throughout the district improve their work through the accounting mutual aid network. He has already been awarded the title of Special Model Accountant of the Echeng County Agricultural Production Cooperative.

    热河湖北许多初中和高小毕业生
    成为农业互助合作组织中的重要骨干
    新华社承德七日电　热河省近几年来有不少初中和高小毕业生担任了农业生产合作社主任、会计或技术员，以及兼任农村民校教师等职务。据十一个县、旗最近召开的青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的统计，出席大会的一千三百多名青年社会主义建设积极分子中有五百七十多名是参加农业生产的初中、高小毕业生。建昌县杨树湾子村女高小毕业生施桂芝，去年回家参加农业生产时不仅说服曾经三度退社的祖父、父亲重新入了社；并且因为她能写会算，还帮助社里培养了两名记账员；不久后被选为社的副主任，出席了建昌县青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。喀喇沁左旗杨树底下村初中毕业生、农业生产合作社社员李庆环，把在学校里学到的一些科学知识，运用到改进农业生产上面去，今春开辟一块试验田，进行窝瓜和黄瓜、豆角和黄瓜嫁接等增产技术试验。结果，这些嫁接的黄瓜比一般黄瓜的产量高，受到其他社员的欢迎。
    新华社武汉七日电　湖北省近两年来先后参加农业生产的几万名初中和高小毕业学生，大部分都成为互助合作组织中的重要骨干和积极分子。浠水县一千五百多个参加农业劳动的初中和高小毕业生，百分之七十担任了农业生产合作社社长、会计、互助组组长和记工员等工作。高小毕业生、合作社副社长郭柏松和互助组组长岑符荫，由于能认真学习先进的农业技术，并带动社、组内的农民推广这些先进经验，使他们领导的合作社和互助组的产量都高于当地一般农户的产量。高小毕业生陈兆坤，去年秋天参加鄂城县六区石山乡华光第二农业生产合作社任会计后，因为肯钻研业务，把社里的财务管理得很好，想出了不少办法来实行节约和减少非生产性开支，并通过会计互助网经常帮助全区十八个合作社的会计改进业务，已获得了鄂城县农业生产合作社特等模范会计的称号。
