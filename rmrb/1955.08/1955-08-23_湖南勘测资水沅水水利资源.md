　　Hunan is conducting intensive surveys of the hydropower resources of the Zi River and Yuan River. In Changde, Shaoyang, Qianyang, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, and other areas within the Zi River and Yuan River basins, hundreds of surveying, prospecting, economic, and geological personnel are traversing mountains and ridges daily, drilling and searching for reservoir sites, or navigating boats through the waves to collect data on flood control, irrigation, and navigation. A batch of data related to topography and geology has already been collected, and geological and topographical maps have been drawn. The reconnaissance team organized by the Central South Hydroelectric Engineering Bureau completed the reconnaissance work in the Zi River basin in June and July. The Yuan River reconnaissance is also about to begin.
