Xinhua News Agency, Casablanca, 24th: Following the August 20th massacre of North African patriots by French colonialists, the French colonial authorities have dispatched large numbers of troops and are launching a frenzied military offensive against the people of Morocco and Algeria. A reign of terror and bloodshed is engulfing these two French colonies. According to Associated Press reporter Hartman, as of the estimated figures on the evening of the 23rd, 2,000 people have been killed in Morocco and Algeria since the 20th. The vast majority of these are local Arabs and Berbers.

On the morning of the 23rd, the French colonial authorities in Morocco dispatched a large number of troops, including armored units, paratroopers, marines, and the Foreign Legion. Led by tanks and armored vehicles, and under the cover of jet fighters, they attacked four Moroccan tribes supporting former Sultan Yusuf along a 100-mile front in the Oud Cheme and Kenifra regions, 100 miles southeast of Casablanca. French newspapers pointed out that this was the largest military operation by French troops in Morocco in the last 30 years. Moroccan tribal people, concealed among the rocks in the mountains, fiercely resisted the attacking French troops.

Currently, the situation in Morocco is very tense. Telephone contact from Casablanca to other parts of Morocco has been cut off, and communications in other areas are also in chaos.

In Algeria, despite continuous military operations by French troops in Constantine, local armed forces are still very active. A French army escort was attacked south of Millas in Constantine province, and another French patrol was ambushed in the same area. On the 23rd, local residents of Philippeville held demonstrations against the French colonialists.

While launching military operations, French military police are also conducting large-scale searches and arrests in various cities, and anyone found with weapons is immediately shot on the spot.

The French authorities are continuing to send troops to North Africa. French Prime Minister Faure announced on the 23rd that he would call up army reservists to strengthen the French forces in North Africa. According to the Associated Press, most of the French front-line troops formerly stationed in West Germany have been successively transported to North Africa to suppress the people's actions.

　　法军对北非人民进行大规模军事进攻
    新华社二十四日讯　卡萨布兰卡消息：继八月二十日法国殖民者对北非爱国者的大屠杀之后，法国殖民当局又调遣了大批军队，正在对摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚人民展开疯狂的军事进攻。腥风血雨笼罩着这两个法国殖民地。据美联社记者哈特曼报道，根据二十三日晚的估计数字，摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚从二十日以来已经有二千人被杀死。其中绝大多数是当地的阿拉伯人和柏伯尔人。
    二十三日清晨，摩洛哥法国殖民当局出动了大批部队，包括装甲部队、伞兵、海军陆战队和外籍军团，以坦克、装甲车为先导，在喷气式飞机掩护下，在卡萨布兰卡东南一百英里的欧德柴姆和肯尼弗拉地区沿一百英里的战线上向支持前苏丹优素福的四个摩洛哥部落进攻。法国报纸指出，这是最近三十年来法国军队在摩洛哥规模最大的一次军事行动。摩洛哥部落人民隐蔽在山上的岩石中间，对进攻的法国军队进行激烈的抵抗。
    目前，摩洛哥局势非常紧张，从卡萨布兰卡通到摩洛哥其他各地的电话联系已经断绝，其他地区的通讯也陷于混乱。
    在阿尔及利亚，尽管法国军队连日在君士坦丁进行军事行动，当地人民武装还是很活跃。一队法军的护卫队在君士坦丁省米利亚以南被袭击，另一队法军巡逻队也在同一地区遭到伏击。二十三日，菲利普维尔当地居民举行了反对法国殖民者的示威。
    与展开军事行动同时，法国军警还在各个城市中进行大规模搜查和逮捕，凡是搜到有武器的人立即被就地枪杀。
    法国当局还在继续调兵到北非去，法国总理富尔二十三日宣布要召集陆军后备人员来加强北非法军的力量。据美联社消息说，大部分曾经驻在西德的法国第一线军队已经陆续运到北非从事镇压人民的行动。
