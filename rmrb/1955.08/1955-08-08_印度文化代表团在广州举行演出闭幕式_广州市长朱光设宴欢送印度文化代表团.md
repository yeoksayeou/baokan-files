Over the past two months, through your visit and performances, the Chinese people have had the great honor of appreciating the richly colorful Indian national art with its strong artistic appeal, thereby evoking our memories of the cultural and artistic exchanges between China and India in ancient times, arousing our sincere admiration for our friendly neighbor, the great Indian people, and enabling us to further understand the Indian people and their simple, wise, brave, and peace-loving character.

As we leave China, we express our gratitude and reluctance to part. The combined population of our two countries accounts for one-third of humanity. The developing and consolidating friendship between India and China has become a huge force in defending world peace. The friendship between India and China has a long history. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China and the independence of India, we have restored our original cultural ties, and in recent years, we have deepened our understanding of each other. I believe that with the passage of time and the improvement of transportation conditions, contact and understanding between our two countries will be more consolidated and developed.
