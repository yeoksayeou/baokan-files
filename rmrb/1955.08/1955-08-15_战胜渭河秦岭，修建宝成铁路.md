To the Editor:

I am a worker participating in the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. Last April, I left technical school and embarked on this great construction site.

At first, I participated in the construction of the Wei River Bridge. It was the summer flood season, and we worked day and night to fight the floods. A dozen water pumps were lined up on the causeway of the Wei River Bridge, pumping water vigorously. The generators and cement mixers roared, harmonizing with the workers' heroic pile-driving chants, creating a symphony of construction. The "Derrick" crane, towering in the sky, constantly turned from east to west, and then from west to east, placing thousands of pounds of cement and steel into the bridge piers. The clamshell bucket I used scooped up sand from the bridge pier caissons, and villagers from dozens of miles away flocked to visit. We did not disappoint the people's expectations, and the bridge was successfully completed.

Then, we entered the Qinling Mountains. The cars climbed to the top of the mountains. Patches of white clouds, like cotton wool, floated under our feet. We plunged into the more arduous and complex struggle of tunneling. The Qinling Tunnel is more than 2,300 meters long, one of the longest tunnels in Guannei. To open the Qinling Tunnel as soon as possible, the project was divided into four sites for simultaneous construction – the south and north entrances were excavated towards the middle, and a "vertical shaft" was opened in the middle, from which excavations were carried out on both sides. Digging a tunnel is not easy! Sometimes we encountered hard rock, and the pneumatic drill just spun, the drill bit sparking, and it couldn't penetrate even a finger's depth in half a day. Sometimes we encountered soft rock, and although drilling was easy, several thousand cubic meters of rock would often collapse suddenly, which could injure people if one wasn't careful. Sometimes, when we were drilling tensely, a stream of spring water would suddenly spurt out, soaking us to the bone; in cold weather, the wet clothes would immediately freeze into an icy "armor." However, we tried everything possible to overcome cave-ins and spring water. Now the tunnel has been dug for more than half its length, and it is expected that by the end of the year, we will "meet" in the long cave.

More than a year of struggle with the Wei River and the Qinling Mountains has made me deeply feel the happiness of being a builder of the motherland. We have conquered the Wei River and are conquering the Qinling Mountains, and we will make the Baoji-Chengdu Railway open to traffic ahead of schedule. The reason why we can have such great strength is because we have received the care of the Party and the support of the people, and because we understand that our hard work today is for the bright future of the people of the whole country. This makes me firmly believe that the Chinese people will overcome all difficulties, complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and build the motherland into a happy and prosperous socialist society.

### 战胜渭河秦岭，修建宝成铁路

    战胜渭河秦岭，修建宝成铁路编辑同志：
    我是参加修建宝成铁路的一个工人。去年四月，我离开技工学校，踏上了这个伟大的建设工地。
    开始时，我参加了修建渭河大桥的工程。那时正逢夏汛，为了同洪水作斗争，日夜施工。十几台抽水机排列在渭河大桥的便道上，一个劲地抽着水。发电机和水泥搅拌机隆隆地转着，同桥工们打桩的雄壮号子声，合奏出一支建设的交响曲。那矗立在高空的“德力克”大吊杆，不断地从东转到西，又从西转到东，把成千斤重的水泥和钢筋放进桥墩。我用的那台抓泥机，一斗一斗地抓着桥墩沉箱里的泥沙，距离工地几十里地的老乡，川流不息地赶来参观。我们没有辜负人民的期望，大桥终于顺利竣工了。
    接着，我们就进入秦岭山区。汽车爬上了山顶。一片片像棉絮似的白云，在我们脚下飘来飘去。我们投入了更艰巨、更复杂的开凿隧道的斗争。秦岭隧道全长二千三百多公尺，这是关内最长的隧道之一。为了早日打通秦岭隧道，工程分四处同时施工——南洞口和北洞口向当中开挖，当中又开个“竖井”，从井底再向两边开挖。挖隧道可不简单呀！有时遇上硬石头，风钻光打空转，钻头刷刷地直冒火光，半天也钻不进一指头深。有时遇上软石，虽然打眼容易，可是经常一下子塌下来好几千方石头，一不小心就会伤人，有时打眼打得正紧张，忽然喷出一股泉水，把人浑身浇湿了；遇上冷天，湿衣服立刻冻成冰的“盔甲”。但是，我们想尽一切办法，战胜塌方，战胜泉水。现在隧道已经打进了一半以上，预计到年底，我们就要在长长的山洞里“会师”。
    一年多来同渭河、秦岭的斗争，使我深深感到作为祖国建设者的幸福。我们已经战胜了渭河，正在征服着秦岭，并且将使宝成铁路提前通车。我们所以能有这样巨大的力量，是由于我们得到了党的关怀和人民的支援，是由于我们懂得我们今天辛勤的劳动是为了全国人民美好的将来。这使我深信，中国人民必将克服一切困难，提前完成第一个五年计划，并把祖国建设成幸福繁荣的社会主义社会。
