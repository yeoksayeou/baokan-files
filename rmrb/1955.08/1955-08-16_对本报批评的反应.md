Responses to Criticism from This Newspaper

　　Since this newspaper exposed and criticized the incident of the CCP Hangxian County Committee forcing farmers to pull out arrowhead seedlings and switch to double-cropping early rice on March 27th, the CCP Zhejiang Provincial Committee immediately conducted an inspection and handled the matter. The inspection results proved that the facts exposed and criticized by this newspaper were completely true. The Provincial Committee gave the Hangxian County Committee a "reprimand" as punishment, gave Comrade Zhang Shusen, the former secretary of the Hangxian County Committee, a public warning, and ordered Comrade Zhang Shusen to make a self-criticism. The Provincial Committee also sent responsible cadres, together with the Hangxian County Committee, to the affected areas to make a public self-criticism to the victimized farmers, providing necessary relief and support to farmers with difficulties in production and life, and leading the general farmers to do a good job in production.
　　The Zhejiang Provincial Committee also conducted self-criticism, stating that the Provincial Committee bore certain responsibility for this incident. While emphasizing increased production, the Provincial Committee did not pay attention to strengthening specific guidance and finding ways to prevent subjectivism and commandism that might arise in the work of lower levels. The General Office of the Provincial Committee had blindly praised the so-called "determination" of the Hangxian County Committee. The Zhejiang Daily also made a public self-criticism because it used front-page news and editorials to promote this erroneous "work experience" of the Hangxian County Committee. The Provincial Committee has instructed other units that should bear certain responsibility for this matter to conduct self-criticism at certain meetings.
　　In order to ensure that the entire province learns from this lesson, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee published this incident in the Zhejiang Daily, and the newspaper also published an editorial.

    对本报批评的反应
    自本报三月二十七日揭露和批判中共杭县县委强迫农民拔掉荸荠苗改种连作早稻的事件后，中共浙江省委即进行检查处理。检查结果，证明本报所揭露批判的事实完全属实，省委即对杭县县委给以“指责”的处分，对原杭县县委书记张树森同志给以当众警告的处分，并令张树森同志作了检讨。省委又派出负责干部会同杭县县委到有关地区向受害农民进行公开检讨，对于生产生活上有困难的农民，给予必要的救济和扶持，对一般农民则领导他们搞好生产。
    浙江省委并进行了自我批评，说明省委对这一事件负有一定责任，省委在强调增产的同时，没有注意加强具体领导和设法防止下级工作中可能产生的主观主义和命令主义作风；省委办公厅曾盲目地表扬杭县县委的所谓“决心”。浙江日报因用过头条新闻和社论来推广杭县县委这种错误的“工作经验”，也作了公开的检讨。对此事应负有一定责任的其他单位，省委已指示必须在一定会议上进行检讨。
    浙江省委为了使全省接受这一教训，在浙江日报上公布了这一事件，报纸并发表了社论。
