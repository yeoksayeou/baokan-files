    All Organizations Should Pay Attention to Saving on Telecommunications Expenses
    By our reporter Gao Changren
    Many organizations in Hubei Province do not pay attention to saving when using telegrams and telephones. In provincial-level organizations, some departments raise the priority of telegrams without restriction. Telegrams that could be sent as "ordinary" or "urgent" are sent as "express" or "special express." Some departments send telegrams for documents that are not time-sensitive and could be mailed, or for documents that have already been published in local newspapers. In December 1954, the Hubei Provincial Statistics Bureau in Wuchang sent a telegram to the Wuhan Municipal Statistics Bureau in Hankou, even though they are only separated by the Yangtze River and telephone communication is very convenient. Some organizations use lengthy wording when sending telegrams. The agricultural department sometimes sends articles as long as 10,000 words by telegram, introducing agricultural production experiences and typical figures in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The waste of using long-distance telephones is also very serious. Some comrades responsible for telephone calls in some organizations often do not prepare before the call, and pick up the phone to talk aimlessly for two or three hours. The phenomenon of repeated calls also occurs frequently. Every year, during the collection of agricultural taxes and unified purchase and sale of grain, the Grain Bureau, the Finance Bureau, and the Finance Committee all call their respective subordinate units in various places for figures. And these units' figures come from the same source. This not only causes a waste of financial resources, but also keeps the staff of subordinate units busy, causing a waste of manpower and time.
    In the organs of the prefectural committee and the commissioner's office, the waste of using telegrams and telephones also exists. Last year, the Jingzhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent flood prevention instructions by telegram to Jingshan County, which had no flood prevention task; and once, it sent instructions on increasing grain production in non-disaster areas by telegram to Honghu County, a severely affected disaster area. The following incident occurred in the office of the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party: A comrade made a long-distance call to the Qianhongshan County Committee, asking the County Committee Office to report on the situation. The call lasted four hours and two minutes, and the comrades in the Prefectural Committee Office only took down a dozen words. Later, probably because the time was too long, the comrade was so tired that he fell asleep next to the telephone!
    The result of unrestricted abuse of telegrams and telephones is that the waste of telecommunications expenses in various departments has reached an alarming level. According to statistics from the Hubei Provincial Department of Finance, the province's telecommunications expenses in 1954 were equivalent to 265 percent of those in 1953. The Jingzhou Prefectural Committee and the Jingzhou Commissioner's Office spent 160,000 yuan on telecommunications expenses in the first quarter of this year, exhausting the annual telecommunications expenses allocated to them by the province, with an overdraft of 20,000 yuan. In addition, the loss caused by abusing telegrams and telephones, occupying lines, and affecting others' telegrams and calls cannot be calculated.
    The main reason for this waste is that departments from leadership to general staff have a supply system mentality. They believe that telecommunications expenses can be reimbursed in full, and when drafting and signing telegrams, they do not consider the urgency, length, or distance of the telegram content and the recipient organization. Some staff members responsible for contacting various places try to quickly understand all the problems in detail through long-distance calls, so they often easily make "express" long-distance calls and talk slowly with the other party. As for excessive call time and overspending, they do not consider it.
    At the end of April this year, the General Office of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party began to expose and criticize the serious waste of telegrams and telephones in various units, and formulated a management system for the use of telephones and telegrams, requiring each unit to limit telecommunications expenses within the approved targets. These regulations have made some units begin to pay attention to saving on the use of telegrams and telephones. For example, recently, when Hubei Province carried out grain collection, purchase, and sales work, the Grain Bureau, the Finance Bureau, and the Provincial People's Committee's Finance and Trade Office, in order to save on the use of telephones, only the Finance and Trade Office communicated with various places to understand the progress and figures of the work, and then copied them to the other two units, overcoming the waste of the past, when three units simultaneously called the lower levels for the same figures.
    However, this is only the beginning of saving on telecommunications expenses. In the future, how to make every staff member establish a concept of thrift and adhere to the savings system still requires all departments to conduct in-depth ideological education on thrift and strengthen inspection and supervision in the system.

### 各机关应该注意节约电讯费用

    各机关应该注意节约电讯费用
    本报记者　高长任
    湖北省有不少机关在使用电报、电话时，是从不注意节省的。在省级机关里，有些机关无限制地提高电报的等级，本来发“平”“急”的电报就可以了，他们却要拍“加急”、“特急”的。有些机关，对于时间性不强、可以邮递的文件，或者所发出的文件在当地报纸上已经公开发表的，他们也往往发了电报。在武昌的湖北省统计局和在汉口的武汉市统计局只一江之隔，电话联系很方便，但在一九五四年十二月份，省统计局竟由武昌向汉口发了一个电报给市统计局。有些机关发电报时，文字冗长。农业部门有时竟将有关农业生产经验及互助合作运动中典型人物介绍等长达一万字的文章用电报发出。使用长途电话的浪费现象也是非常严重的。有些机关负责通话的同志，经常在通话之前无准备，拿起话筒就漫无边际地长谈起来，有时通话达两三个小时。通话重复的现象也经常发生。每年，征收农业税和粮食统购统销的时候，粮食厅、财政厅、财委会都分别打电话给各地所属单位要数字。而这些单位的数字则是一个来源，这不仅造成财力上的浪费，也使所属单位的工作人员忙于应付，造成人力和时间上的浪费。
    在地委和专署机关里，使用电报、电话的浪费现象也同样存在。去年，中共荆州地委曾把防汛指示用电报发到没有防汛任务的京山县；又有一次，把非灾区增产粮食的指示用电报发到重灾区洪湖县。在中共襄阳地委办公室曾发生过这样一件事：有位同志给前洪山县委打长途电话，要县委办公室汇报情况，通话时间长达四小时零二分，地委办公室的同志只记了十几个字，后来大概由于时间太长，这位同志竟疲劳得在话机旁边睡着了！
    无限制地滥用电报、电话的结果，使各部门的电讯费用的浪费达到惊人的程度。据湖北省财政厅统计，一九五四年全省付出的电讯费用，相当于一九五三年的百分之二百六十五。荆州地委和荆州专署机关今年第一季度内就开支了电讯费十六万元，把省里核定给他们的全年的电讯费用光了，还超支两万元。此外，因滥发电报、滥用电话而占用线路，影响别人发报、通话的损失，就无法计算了。
    造成这种浪费的主要原因，是各部门从领导到一般工作人员都有供给制思想。他们认为电讯费可以实报实销，在草拟和签发电报时，不考虑电报内容的缓、急，文字的长、短，受文机关的远、近。有些负责同各地联系的工作人员，企图在长途电话中很快地把什么问题都细致地了解，他们就常常轻易地挂“加急”长途电话，同对方慢慢地谈。至于通话时间过长，话费超支，他们是不考虑的。
    今年四月底，中共湖北省委办公厅开始揭发和批判了各单位使用电报、电话的严重浪费现象，并订出了使用电话电报的管理制度，要求各单位把电讯费用限制在核定的指标之内。这些规定已经使得有些单位开始重视节约使用电报电话。如最近湖北省各地进行粮食的征、购、销工作时，粮食厅、财政厅、省人民委员会财粮贸办公室为了节约使用电话，只由财粮贸办公室同各地通话，了解工作的进度和数字，再抄送其他两个单位，就克服了过去三个单位同时打电话向下面要同样数字的浪费现象。
    不过，这仅是节约电讯费用的开始。今后，如何使每一个工作人员都树立节约观念，坚持节约制度，还是需要各部门深入进行节约的思想教育、并在制度上加强检查和监督的。
