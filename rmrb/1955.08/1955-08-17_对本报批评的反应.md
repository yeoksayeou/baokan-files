    Response to Criticism from This Newspaper
    The People's Daily published an article on May 12 entitled "Why Turn a Blind Eye to the Destructive Activities of Rich Peasants?" criticizing the error of the Zhuoxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province in condoning the destructive behavior of rich peasant elements. After seeing this article, the Zhuoxian County Committee held three meetings to discuss the matter in detail and earnestly, and sent an investigation team to conduct an in-depth investigation into Zhang Rui's class status and destructive activities. The results of the investigation confirmed that Zhang Rui was a consistently reactionary rich peasant who not only cruelly exploited peasants before the land reform but also did not abandon exploitation after the land reform, and engaged in destructive activities during the unified purchase and sale of grain. After investigation, he has been dealt with according to law by the County People's Court. The County Committee believes that this incident greatly enhanced their revolutionary vigilance. They plan to use this fact to conduct in-depth class education among all county staff and the broad masses.

    对本报批评的反应
    本报五月十二日刊登“为什么对富农的破坏活动熟视无睹”一文，批评了中共河北涿县县委纵容富农分子破坏行为的错误。涿县县委看到这篇文章以后，召开三次会议详细而认真地讨论了这件事，并且派了一个调查小组对张瑞的成分和破坏活动进行了深入的调查。调查的结果证实张瑞是一个一贯很反动的富农，不但土地改革以前凶狠地剥削农民，在土地改革以后也没有放弃剥削行为，并且在粮食统购统销中进行破坏活动。经过调查以后，已由县人民法院依法处理。县委认为这件事大大提高了他们的革命警惕性。他们准备运用这一事实在全县工作人员和广大群众中进行一次深入的阶级教育。
