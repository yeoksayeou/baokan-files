In his report, Yasui Kaoru said: The Hiroshima meeting proved that people of all countries in the world, regardless of differences in social systems, political factions, and religious beliefs, can fully agree on the point of prohibiting atomic and hydrogen bombs. He emphasized that representatives from Asian countries all believe that Japanese military bases are not only a problem for Japan but also an important problem for Asia.

Representatives from participating countries spoke at the conference, and their speeches repeatedly drew thunderous applause from the audience. Indian representative Kidwai suggested establishing an international committee to provide relief to atomic bomb victims in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

The head of the Soviet delegation stated that the Soviet delegation fully supported this suggestion.

Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese delegation, said: "The Chinese people feel the pain of the Japanese people who have suffered from atomic bomb disasters as if they had personally experienced it." He then read out at the meeting a joint letter of condolence entrusted to the Chinese delegation to the Japanese Preparatory Committee of the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs by six people's organizations: the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Red Cross Society of China, the China Relief Association, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and the All-China Youth Federation. The letter of condolence stated: "The China Relief Association has successively received letters from the Japan National Relief Association and the Hiroshima Atomic Bomb Victims Association calling for assistance to Japanese atomic bomb victims. The Chinese people express their heartfelt sympathy and deep concern for the unfortunate experiences of Japanese atomic bomb victims.

"We—the six Chinese people's organizations—specially represent the entire Chinese people and entrust the Chinese delegation participating in the Japanese World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs to present your association with 50,000 yuan in Chinese currency as the Chinese people's aid and condolences to the Japanese atomic bomb victims. And please convey the Chinese people's respect for the Japanese people who are fighting to prohibit atomic and hydrogen bombs."

Professor Petrov of the Soviet delegation presented academic documents related to the peaceful use of atomic energy and the treatment of atomic diseases to the Japanese Preparatory Committee at the conference.

At this time, more than 30 atomic bomb victims with scarred faces rushed from Hiroshima and Nagasaki to participate in the conference. The entire audience welcomed and comforted them with warm applause.

Subsequently, in an atmosphere of warm international friendship, the conference presented flowers to representatives of various countries. Representatives from various countries shook hands with atomic bomb victims and extended cordial condolences.
