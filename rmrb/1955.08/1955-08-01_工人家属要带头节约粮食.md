Workers' Family Members Should Take the Lead in Conserving Grain

Ma Peiying

Since the rectification of the grain unified purchase and sales work began, most family members in the East Dormitory of our Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory have understood the importance of conserving grain. However, some people say, "We buy grain with our own money, why would anyone waste it!" Others say, "Factories and hospitals waste much more, a little waste at home doesn't matter!" After listening to the propaganda from the grain work team and carefully calculating the accounts, everyone has become increasingly aware of the waste in their own homes. Take our East Dormitory, for example. Discarded steamed buns and rice are often found in dirt bins and ditches. Some families always have leftovers from their meals, which they then feed to chickens and ducks. There are many children in the East Dormitory, and when they get fussy, adults break off a piece of steamed bun for them, only to have the child throw it away a moment later. The rice at the bottom of my rice bin always sits untouched, and the good rice gets infested with insects and is wasted. Isn't there a lot of waste like this? But in the past, no one paid attention. Furthermore, the phenomenon of grain outflow also occurs frequently in our East Dormitory. Some people come to visit relatives in name, but in reality, they take grain away with them when they leave. Shouldn't these wasteful and speculative phenomena have been eliminated long ago!

Now, family members believe that grain should be conserved in all aspects. Jiang Niang, who lives with me, said, "In the past, I thought I was careful in my daily life and didn't waste anything; but upon reflection, there was waste. For example, when washing rice, I often let the rice grains at the bottom of the basin wash away. Even if it's just a drop or a grain, it adds up for every household, and how much grain would be wasted in a year! From now on, I must be careful and calculate everything precisely, and conserve grain." An old lady named Liang said, "The grain consumption plan is designed to help us conserve grain. During the Japanese occupation, even if we wanted to set a grain consumption plan, where could we buy grain then! At that time, didn't we working people often have nothing to eat!" Some other elderly women also said that they would not only abide by the government's policies in the future, but also monitor those speculative merchants and not let them undermine the grain policy. The family members of the workers all know that the factory needs a large amount of cotton every day, and it all depends on the farmers to produce it. Some family members say, "If we conserve grain, the farmers can free up their strength to grow more cotton, and our textile workers can increase production. Wouldn't conserving grain support national construction!" Many of the family members in the East Dormitory come from the countryside, and they have also seen the benefits of implementing unified grain purchase and sales and conserving grain from their own personal experiences. An old lady named Guan, whose hometown was hit by a disaster, said, "If a disaster had happened in the past, the price of grain would have risen to who knows how much! But now, the price hasn't risen a penny, and everyone has food to eat. Isn't it all because of the government's good regulation!" I myself think the same way: if every household buys grain according to the plan, buying what they need and eating it right away, so that there is more grain in the national warehouses, then industrial construction and people's lives will be more secure. I am a worker's family member, and I will definitely act in accordance with the government's requirements, take the lead in setting a good grain consumption plan, and conserve grain; I will also do a good job of publicity among the family members so that everyone will set a good grain consumption plan.

In order for state personnel and workers to be able to exemplarily comply with the grain ration system, they must first be educated about the state's grain unified purchase and sales policy and grain conservation. This responsibility should be mainly borne by the leading personnel of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League of various organs, organizations, enterprises, and schools. The municipal and district governments and street organizations can only play a coordinating role in this regard. The grain conservation work of various organs, organizations, enterprises, and schools should be planned and inspected to make this work regular. It is necessary to oppose perfunctoriness in grain conservation, and to oppose the erroneous practice of making a mobilization and deployment, and then no longer making inspections. The Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League of organs, organizations, enterprises, and schools should also organize appropriate forces to carry out work among the families of staff and workers.

In order to rectify the urban grain unified purchase and sales work, it is also necessary to change the abnormal increase in the urban population. State personnel and workers should also help the government to do this work well. In the past, a large number of relatives of state personnel and workers poured into the cities, which was one of the important reasons for the abnormal expansion of the urban population. Therefore, state personnel and workers should carry out necessary persuasion and education on their relatives, so that they can work in the countryside with peace of mind and not blindly enter the cities. For relatives who have already entered the city and who can originally engage in labor production in the countryside, they should be mobilized to return to their hometown to engage in production. Doing so can not only reduce the burden of national grain supply, but also reduce the economic burden of those state personnel and workers themselves.

Implementing the state's grain unified purchase and sales policy is not only an important task at present, but also a long-term struggle in the future. State personnel and workers should raise their awareness and use practical actions to lead the vast urban residents to consciously abide by the state's grain ration system, and at the same time, fight against all behaviors that waste grain and undermine the state's grain unified purchase and sales policy.

    工人家属要带头节约粮食
    马佩英
    开始整顿粮食统销工作以后，我们天津棉纺一厂东宿舍大部分家属都懂得了节约粮食的道理。可是也有人说：粮食是自己拿钱买的，谁家肯浪费呀！也有的说：工厂、医院里浪费才多，家庭里浪费一星半点算不了什么！我们听了粮食工作组的同志宣传，又经过算细账，大家对自己家里的浪费现象，才看得越来越清楚了。就说我们东宿舍吧，土箱里、地沟里常常有扔掉的馒头、米饭，有些人家做的饭总有剩余，剩下的就喂了鸡、鸭。东宿舍的小孩子很多，孩子一闹大人就掰块馒头给他，有时一转眼孩子又把馒头扔了。我家的米柜下面一部分米总不动，好好的米生了虫子就糟蹋了。像这样的浪费不是很多吗？可是过去大家都没注意。再说，粮食外流的现象在我们东宿舍也常发生，有的人明着是来串亲，实际上临走时把粮食倒腾走了。这些浪费和投机现象，不是早就应该想办法消灭的吗！
    现在，家属们都认为应该从各方面节约粮食了。和我住在一块儿的蒋娘说：“过去我觉得自己过日子仔细，没有一点浪费；细想一下浪费不是没有，比如淘米的时候常把盆底下的米粒冲跑了。哪怕是一滴一点，家家户户，聚少成多，一年到头得浪费多少粮食啊！以后一定得处处精打细算，节约粮食。”有个梁大娘说：“订用粮计划就是为了让咱们节约粮食，日本鬼子占领的时候，咱们就是要想订个用粮计划，那时到哪里去买粮食啊！那时节，我们这些劳动人民不是常常没有吃的吗！”也有的老大娘说，以后不光自己要遵守政府的政策，还要监视那些投机倒把的奸商，不让他们破坏粮食政策。职工家属们都知道工厂每天需要的大量的棉花，都要靠农民来生产。有的家属就这样说：咱们节约粮食，农民们也就可以腾出力量来多种棉花，咱们纺织工人也就可以增加生产。咱们节约粮食不就支援了国家建设吗！东宿舍的家属有不少是从乡下来的，他们也从自己的亲身体验里看到实行粮食统销和节约粮食的好处。有个关大娘，老家受灾了，她说：“要是过去受了灾，粮食不知涨到多少钱啦！可是现在一个钱也没涨，老百姓都有饭吃。这不都是因为政府调剂的好吗！”我自己也这样想：如果我们家家户户都按计划买粮，现吃现买，让国家仓库里有更多的粮食，那末工业建设和人民生活就更有保障了。我是个工人家属，我一定按照政府的要求办事，带头订好用粮计划，节约粮食；还要向家属们作好宣传工作，让大家都来订好用粮计划。
    为了使国家工作人员和工人能够模范地遵守粮食计划供应制度，首先必须对他们进行关于国家粮食统销政策和节约粮食的教育，这个责任应当主要地由各个机关、团体、企业、学校等单位的党、行政、工会、青年团的领导人员担负起来，市、区政府和街道组织在这方面只能起配合的作用。各个机关、团体企业、学校节约粮食的工作应当有布置、有检查，使这一工作经常化；必须反对在节约粮食方面敷衍塞责，反对那种作过动员、布置，就不再作检查的错误作法。机关、团体、企业、学校等的党、行政、工会、青年团还应当组织适当的力量，在工作人员和工人的家属中进行工作。
    为了整顿城市粮食统销工作，还必须改变城市人口不正常地增加的情况。国家工作人员和工人也应当帮助政府作好这件工作。过去一个时期，许多国家工作人员和工人的亲属大量地涌进城市，是形成城市人口不正常地膨胀的重要原因之一。因此，国家工作人员和工人应当对自己的亲属进行必要的说服教育，使他们在农村安心生产，不要盲目进城。对于已经进城的本来可以在农村从事劳动生产的亲属，应当动员他们回乡生产。这样做，不但可以减轻国家粮食供应的负担，也可以减轻那些国家工作人员和工人本人的经济负担。
    贯彻国家粮食统销政策，不但是当前一项重要工作，也是今后一个长时期的斗争。国家工作人员和工人应当提高觉悟，用实际行动来带动广大城市居民自觉地服从国家的粮食计划供应制度，同时向
  一切浪费粮食和破坏国家粮食统销政策的行为进行斗争。
