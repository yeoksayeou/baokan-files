　　Fujian Province Intensifies Leadership to Guide Farmers in Striving for Increased Autumn Crop Production
　　Shandong Province Expects Bumper Harvest of Over 17 Million Mu of Sweet Potatoes
　　Party and government leading organs at all levels in Fujian Province have dispatched over ten thousand county and district cadres to rural areas to lead farmers in striving to overfulfill the autumn crop production increase plan.
　　Since late July, various localities, in accordance with the directive of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China "Regarding Launching a Movement for Over-Plan Increase in Autumn Production," have successively held meetings to specifically study methods for increasing production.
　　Currently, over two million mu of mid-season rice in the province is about to ripen; over twelve million mu of single-season and double-season late rice has tillered or is tillering, and is generally growing vigorously; sweet potatoes have also begun to tuberize, and late-autumn crops such as autumn soybeans have been successively sown. Various localities are mobilizing farmers to strengthen field management, continue to build water conservancy projects, increase fertilizer accumulation, and prevent and control diseases, insect pests, and animal damage in order to strive for a bumper harvest. The Jianyang Special District has mobilized over 40,000 women and children to carry out an autumn fertilizer accumulation campaign, accumulating 500,000 dan of fertilizer in the past half-month. The Longxi and Jinjiang Special Districts have mobilized 500,000 laborers to start construction on two large-scale water conservancy projects capable of irrigating over 95,000 mu. The Nanping and Fu'an Special Districts have organized a total of over 900 hunting teams to protect crops from damage by wild animals. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various localities, in order to support farmers in carrying out autumn planting in a timely manner, have transported large quantities of fertilizer powder and pest control equipment to rural areas.
　　According to the autumn over-production plans formulated by various localities received by the Fujian Provincial Agricultural Leading Organs, the increase in production figures specified in these plans, in addition to making up for the losses in early rice production due to drought, may also show varying degrees of increase compared to last year.

　　In Shandong Province's Jiaodong Peninsula and the southern Linyi, Tai'an, and other special districts, the spring-planted sweet potatoes are growing plump, and many sweet potato mounds have cracked with deep seams. According to agricultural departments' estimates, if there are no major unexpected disasters, the yield of the province's 17,590,000 mu of sweet potatoes can be converted into over 6 billion jin of grain (four jin of sweet potatoes equals one jin of grain). Shandong Province has a large population and limited land, and the planting area of economic crops is expanding year by year. The large-scale increase in sweet potato planting by farmers has played a significant role in solving the supply of grain and livestock feed.
　　The Communist Party committees and people's governments at all levels in Shandong Province have continuously promoted high-quality sweet potato varieties such as "Victory No. 100" and "Nonglin No. 4" to farmers, as well as experience in preventing and controlling sweet potato black rot, so that the yield per unit area of sweet potatoes has increased year by year. Last year, the sweet potatoes in the Wendeng and Laiyang Special Districts averaged around 1,800 jin per mu. Wang Benshui, a farmer from Xiao Village in the Second District of Wendeng County, planted "Victory No. 100" sweet potatoes and yielded 10,345 jin per mu, more than six times the yield of local varieties.

### 福建省深入领导农民争取秋季作物增产  山东省一千七百多万亩甘薯丰收有望

　　福建省深入领导农民争取秋季作物增产
　　山东省一千七百多万亩甘薯丰收有望
　　福建省各级党政领导机关抽调了一万多名县、区工作人员，深入农村领导农民争取超额完成秋季农作物增产计划。
　　七月下旬以来，各地根据中共福建省委“关于开展秋季超计划增产运动”的指示，先后召开了会议，具体研究了增产办法。
　　目前，全省二百多万亩中稻即将成熟；一千二百多万亩单季晚稻和双季晚稻已经分蘖或正在分蘖，一般生长茁壮；甘薯也开始结块，秋大豆等晚秋作物已陆续播种。各地正在发动农民加强田间管理，继续兴修水利，增积肥料，防治病虫兽害，以争取丰收。建阳专区发动四万多个妇女、儿童开展秋季积肥运动，近半个月来积肥已达五十万担。龙溪、晋江两专区发动五十万民工动工兴建两个可灌溉九万五千多亩的大型水利工程。南平、福安两专区共组织了九百多个打猎队，保护庄稼免受野兽残害。各地供销合作部门为支援农民及时进行秋种，已把大批的肥田粉和治虫药械运往农村。
　　根据福建省农业领导机关收到各地制定的秋季超额增产计划来看，这些计划中规定的增产数字除了能弥补早稻因旱灾而减产的损失以外，还可能比去年有不同程度的增产。  （新华社）
　　山东省胶东半岛和南部临沂、泰安等专区春种的甘薯长得肥大，许多甘薯墩都裂开了很深的缝。据农业部门估计，如果没有大的意外灾害，全省一千七百五十九万亩甘薯的产量，可折合粮食（四斤甘薯折一斤粮食）六十多亿斤。山东省人多地少，经济作物播种面积又在逐年扩大，农民大量增植甘薯对解决粮食和牲畜饲料的供应，起了很大作用。
　　山东省中共各级党委和人民政府，连年向农民推广“胜利百号”、“农林四号”等甘薯良种和防治甘薯黑斑病的经验，使甘薯的单位面积产量逐年提高。去年，文登、莱阳两专区的甘薯，平均每亩产一千八百斤左右。文登县第二区西敖村农民王本水种植的“胜利百号”甘薯，每亩产一万零三百四十五斤，高出当地品种的产量六倍以上。
