    In Iowa
    "Pravda" Special Correspondent Litoshko
    Americans always speak of Iowa with pride. Some call it "America's Granary," and others call it "Land of Abundance." The Indian word "Iowa" means "Beautiful Land."

    Indeed, nature has generously endowed this region of the United States with its wealth. Fertile black soil, ample rainfall, and excellent climate conditions make Iowa worthy of the glory of being the most fertile state in the United States. Its land grows corn, oats, and soybeans. Herds of cattle, pigs, and sheep graze on the prairies. No matter what you talk about with the local residents, it invariably involves corn. Corn is the state's glory and pride, and the source of the welfare of the state's residents.

    One-third of all cultivated land in the state is planted with corn. And Iowa's corn production accounts for one-fifth of the corn produced in the United States.

    Corn is an excellent livestock feed, and in this relatively small and sparsely populated state (two and a half million residents), twenty million pigs and many beef and dairy cattle are raised each year.

    The residents of Iowa say in unison: "We couldn't do this without corn."

    It is not surprising that the glorious idea of exchanging agricultural delegations with the Soviet Union arose in this state, precisely because Americans know of the Soviets' interest in corn.

    The American public showed great interest in the Soviet agricultural delegation. Behind the cars in which the Soviet delegation was traveling during their visit, there were at least sixty cars following, filled with newspaper reporters, photographers, and cinematographers. It is entirely understandable that Americans are so interested in guests from the Soviet Union. In ten years of the "Cold War," many obstacles, through no fault of the Soviet Union, have been created, hindering broad and friendly exchanges between the two great peoples. Over these years, how many fabrications and malicious slanders have American newspapers made about socialist countries and their people! Broad sections of American society see the visit of the Soviet delegation to the United States as a major political event, as it marks the beginning of a new era in the relations between the two countries, opening the way for further strengthening the ties between the American and Soviet peoples. American newspapers unanimously acknowledged that the Soviet agricultural delegation's visit to Iowa had such a character: it truly showed the friendly feelings that the peoples of the United States and the Soviet Union held for each other.

    "Throughout Iowa, there is a missionary-like enthusiasm, with everyone hoping to show the Russians that Iowa wants peace, that Iowa wants to be friendly with the Russian people and only harbors friendly feelings towards them." These words were said by Whitney, an Associated Press reporter who followed the Soviet agricultural delegation in Iowa. Whitney, like many other American reporters, did not hide his surprise at how warmly and happily the Soviets were received everywhere in America. A recent issue of "The New York Times Magazine" pointed out that the Soviet delegation's visit to Iowa "truly demonstrated the good feelings between Russians and Americans." Many American reporters with ill intentions toward the Soviet Union are busy making various speculations, trying to find the reasons for the Soviet delegation's success in the United States. The reason is quite obvious. The American people want peace and hate war. They want to live in peace and friendship with the Soviet people and are very happy to have the opportunity to express their goodwill towards the Soviet Union.

    A large businessman and farmer in Iowa told an Associated Press reporter: "The people here are very tired of the propaganda about war and international tensions, and probably the whole country is like that. We want to make some efforts to end this situation, which is why I think it's a good idea for the Russians to visit here." Another resident of Iowa said: "We want to live in peace with the Russians, and we assume that they also want to live in peace with us."

    The residents of Iowa often call the members of the Soviet agricultural delegation "our Soviet friends" or "envoys of goodwill." From the very beginning of the meetings, there were enthusiastic and friendly conversations about agricultural issues, peace, and the relationship between the peoples of the two great countries. It is indeed difficult to say who asked more questions. Before the Soviet representatives could even jot down the various aspects of agriculture they were interested in, they were constantly bombarded with questions such as: "What is a collective farm?" "What does Stalingrad look like now?" "Is it true that Soviet farmers can receive free medical care and send their children to universities?" "How do the Soviets view the resolutions of the Geneva Conference?"

    How much difficulty and distress occurred when the Soviet representatives sometimes declined to visit some farms or towns because they were too busy and had no free time! Recently, the authorities of Sioux City asked Congress and the Governor to "influence" the Soviet agricultural delegation to make sure the delegation visited their city, even if only for a few hours. The city's hospitable hosts even provided a special plane for the Soviet guests to use, so that they would not be tired from the long journey by car. Although the Soviet delegation's itinerary was far from Sioux City, they still had to agree to the insistent request of the city's residents.

    It is difficult, and probably impossible, to cite all the many examples of the friendship and respect that the residents of Iowa showed to the envoys of the Soviet people.

    In a hotel in Ames where the Soviet delegation was staying, a nine-year-old child walked in. He was holding a children's hat lined with fur. This kind of hat, called a "Davy Crockett hat" in memory of the protagonist of a very popular film, is now worn by millions of children in the United States. The American child smiled shyly and said, "I want to give this hat to a Soviet child."

    Sometimes, enthusiastic residents of Iowa complain that they do not understand Russian. But there is a language that everyone understands. This language is a friendly smile and a firm handshake of friendship. This language does not require translation. It conveys the feelings, thoughts, and emotions of ordinary Americans more eloquently than any vocabulary.

    True, even now, many angry comments can still be found in American newspapers, and the writers of these comments cannot hide their dissatisfaction with the friendly feelings expressed by the Soviets and Americans towards each other. Of course, the guardians of the "Cold War" in the United States have not wavered, but an unfavorable moment has come for them, that is, they have to increasingly take into account the feelings of the American people.

    Some Americans asked the Soviet representatives not long ago: "What do you like most in Iowa?"

    "The people, ordinary Americans, their love of labor, their energy, and their indomitable will to maintain peace and to live in friendship with the Soviet people."

    This answer from the head of the Soviet agricultural delegation won friendly applause and cheers of approval from the Americans.

    在衣阿华州
    “真理报”特派记者　利托希科
    美国人谈起衣阿华州时总是带着骄傲的神色。有人把它称为“美国的谷仓”，也有人称为“天府”。印第安文“衣阿华”这个字的意思是“美丽之乡”。
    的确，大自然慷慨地把自己的财富赋予了美国这个地区。肥沃的黑土、充足的雨水和很好的气候条件使衣阿华不愧于蒙受美国最肥沃的一州的光荣。它的土地上生长玉蜀黍、燕麦、大豆。草原上牧放着牛群、猪群和羊群。不论同当地居民谈起什么，必然涉及玉蜀黍。玉蜀黍是这个州的光荣和骄傲，是州内居民福利的泉源。
    这个州全部耕地的三分之一栽种了玉蜀黍。而衣阿华州所产的玉蜀黍则占美国生产的玉蜀黍的五分之一。
    玉蜀黍是很好的牲畜饲料，在这个面积比较不算大，人口不多（两百五十万居民）的州中，每年饲养二千万头猪和许多肉用及奶用的牲畜。
    衣阿华州的居民异口同声地说：“如果没有玉蜀黍，我们就做不到这一点。”
    正是由于美国人知道了苏联人对玉蜀黍的兴趣，在这个州也就产生了同苏联交换农业代表团的光荣的思想，这一点是没有什么值得惊奇的。
    美国的公众对苏联农业代表团表现了极大的关心。在苏联代表团访问时所乘的汽车后面，至少有六十辆汽车跟随着，里面有报纸记者、摄影师和电影摄影师。美国人对苏联来的客人们这样感兴趣，这是完全可以理解的。在十年“冷战”中产生了许许多多过错不在苏联的障碍，这些障碍妨碍着两国伟大人民的广泛的和友好的往来。这些年来，美国报纸对社会主义国家和它的人民作了多少的捏造和恶意的谩骂！广泛的美国社会人士把苏联代表团的访问美国看成是一个巨大的政治事件，因为它标志着两国互相关系方面的新纪元的开始，它打开了进一步加强美苏两国人民的联系的道路。美国报纸一致承认，苏联农业代表团的访问衣阿华州具有这样一种性质：它真正地显示出美国和苏联两国人民满怀着友好的感情。
    “在整个衣阿华州，到处洋溢着传教士般的热情，大家希望向俄国人表示，衣阿华是想和平的，衣阿华想同俄国人民友好相处并且对他们只抱着友好的感情。”这些话是跟随苏联农业代表团在衣阿华州采访的美联社记者惠特尼说的。惠特尼同美国其他许多记者一样，没有掩盖他对美国人到处这样热烈和愉快地接待苏联来宾这种情况的惊奇。最近一期“纽约时代杂志”指出，苏联代表的访问衣阿华州“真正表现出了俄国人和美国人互相间的善良的感情”。许多对苏联心怀不善的美国记者都忙于作种种臆测，他们企图找出苏联代表团在美国成功的原因。这种原因是十分明显的。美国人民希望和平和仇恨战争。他们希望同苏联人民和平和友好相处，很高兴有机会来表示自己对苏联的善意的态度。
    衣阿华州的一个大企业主兼农场主向美联社记者说：“这个地方的人民对关于战争和国际紧张局势的宣传已十分厌倦了，全国大概也是这样，我们希望尽些努力来结束这种情况，这就是为什么我认为俄国人来这里访问是很好的主张。”衣阿华州的另一个居民说：“我们想同俄国人和平相处，我们推想，他们也是愿意同我们和平相处的。”
    衣阿华州的居民常称苏联农业代表团的团员为“我们的苏联朋友”或者是“善意的使者”。从会见一开始，彼此就对农业问题，对和平和两个伟大国家的人民之间的相互关系，进行热烈和友好的谈话。的确很难说谁向谁问的话比较多。苏联代表对他们所关心的农业各个方面的问题还没有来得及记到笔记本上去，就有人向他们接连不断地提出这样一些问题：“集体农庄是什么东西？”、“斯大林格勒现在什么样子？”、“苏联农民可以免费医疗和送自己的子女进高等学校，这是真的吗？”、“苏联人对日内瓦会议的决议怎样看法？”
    苏联代表有时因为太忙和没有空闲时间而谢绝访问一些农场或者市镇的时候，曾发生了多少的为难和苦恼！最近，苏城的当局要求国会和州长“影响”苏联农业代表团，使代表团一定要访问他们的城市，即使是几小时也好。城市的殷勤的主人甚至给一架专机供苏联客人们使用，以使他们不受乘坐汽车的长途跋涉的劳累。虽然苏联代表团的行程离苏城很远，但还是不得不答应这一个城市的居民的坚决请求。
    很难，恐怕也不可能举出所有的许多表明衣阿华州的居民对苏联人民的使者表示的友情和尊敬的例子。
    在阿密斯城苏联代表团住的一个旅馆里，走进一个九岁的小孩子。他手里拿着一顶镶着毛皮的儿童帽。这种帽子是为纪念一个很受欢迎的影片中的主角而被称为“戴维·克罗凯特帽”的，现在美国千百万儿童都戴这种帽子。这个美国儿童忸怩地笑着说：“我想把这顶帽子送给一个苏联小孩。”
    有时，兴致勃勃的衣阿华州居民抱怨不懂俄文。但是有一种大家都懂得的语言。这种语言就是友好的微笑和紧紧的朋友的握手。这种语言是不须要翻译的。它比任何词汇都能更雄辩地传达出普通美国人的感情、思想和情绪。
    不错，现在在美国报纸上也还可以发现不少气愤的评语，这些评论的执笔者掩盖不住对苏联人和美国人表示互相友好的感情的不满。当然，“冷战”的守护者在美国并没有动摇，但是对他们来说一个不利的时刻来到了，这就是不得不越来越多地考虑到美国人民的情绪。
    一些美国人不久以前问苏联代表们说：“你们在衣阿华州最喜欢什么？”
    “人，普通的美国人，他们的热爱劳动的精神、精力和希望维护和平和同苏联人民友好相处的不屈不挠的意志。”
    苏联农业代表团团长的这一回答博得了美国人的友好的鼓掌欢迎和表示赞成的欢呼。
