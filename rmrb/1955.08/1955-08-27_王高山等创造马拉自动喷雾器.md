Wang Gaoshan and Others Create Horse-Drawn Automatic Sprayer

    Recently, Wang Gaoshan, a soldier from a production unit of the Xinjiang Military Region, and Zhu Guangxi, an intern student from the August 1st Agricultural College, created a horse-drawn automatic sprayer for controlling cotton field pests.

    In the past, when pests occurred in the cotton fields of this unit, they mostly used single-tube sprayers, with one person pumping air and one person spraying, each single-tube sprayer could only spray seven mu per day at most, which wasted labor and could not prevent and control pests in a timely manner. After research, Wang Gaoshan and Zhu Guangxi connected eight single-tube sprayers together, using the power of the wheels moving forward and a special device to make the sprayer automatically pump air. As long as one person leads the horse in front and one person controls the eight spray nozzles in the back, they can spray more than 120 mu of cotton fields a day, saving 14 laborers per day compared to before, greatly improving work efficiency.

    This horse-drawn automatic sprayer has been inspected by Zhang Xuezu, a professor of pest control at the August 1st Agricultural College, and has been proven to have good results.

　　王高山等创造马拉自动喷雾器
    新疆军区生产部队某部战士王高山和八一农学院实习同学朱光玺最近创造了一种防治棉田虫害的马拉自动喷雾器。
    过去，这个部队当棉田发生虫害时，多以一人打气一人喷雾的单管喷雾器进行喷药，每个单管最多一天只能喷药七亩，既浪费劳动力，又不能及时防治虫害。王高山、朱光玺两人在研究后，把八个单管喷雾器并衔在一起，利用轮子前进的动力和一种特别的装置，使喷雾器自动打气，只要前面一人牵马，后面一人掌握八个喷头，一天就能喷洒棉田一百二十多亩，较以前每天节省劳动力十四个，工效大大提高。
    这种马拉自动喷雾器经过八一农学院虫害教授张学祖的检验，证明效果良好。
