A letter from Communist Youth League member Zhang Xiuzhen: In July of last year, she moved from 5th Street, Nankou Town, Changping County, to Zhangjiakou. At that time, the secretary of the 5th Street League branch asked her to inform the League branch of her address after arriving in Zhangjiakou so that her League organizational affiliation could be transferred. However, after arriving in Zhangjiakou, she wrote more than a dozen letters and personally went to Nankou three times to inquire, but the transfer still had not been completed. Later, she went to Nankou again to find the secretary of the 5th Street League branch, only to find out that her affiliation had already been transferred.

After we entrusted the Changping County Committee of the Communist Youth League to investigate, the situation was as follows: When transferring Zhang Xiuzhen's organizational affiliation, it was not sent through proper channels. Instead, it was entrusted to an unfamiliar railway worker to deliver, which resulted in the affiliation not being transferred and its whereabouts becoming unknown.

We believe that the practice of casually handing over a League member's affiliation to a stranger is extremely wrong. This not only risks losing the affiliation but could also allow bad elements to exploit the situation, impersonating League members to carry out sabotage activities. The Changping County Committee of the Communist Youth League should educate its affiliated League organizations to correct this kind of paralyzing thought and irresponsible work style.

### 转关系不应该草率

　　转关系不应该草率
    青年团员张秀贞来信：她在去年七月由昌平县南口镇五街迁移到张家口去。当时五街团支部书记让她到张家口后把住址告诉团支部，以便把她的团的组织关系转去。但是，她到张家口后先后写了十几封信，并且亲自到南口去催问三次，关系还没有转到。后来她又到南口去找五街团支部书记，才知道她的关系早已转去了。
    经我们委托青年团昌平县委会检查，情况原来是这样：由于在转张秀贞的组织关系的时候，没有用正当的方法寄递，却托请一个不相识的铁路工作人员转交，以致关系没有转到，下落不明了。
    我们认为，把团员关系随便交给陌生人的做法，是极其错误的。这不但会丢失关系，而且可能让坏分子钻空子，冒充团员来进行破坏活动。青年团昌平县委会应该教育所属团组织纠正这种麻痹思想和不负责任的作风。
