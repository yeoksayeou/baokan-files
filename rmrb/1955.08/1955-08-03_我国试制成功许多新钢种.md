    China Successfully Trials Many New Steel Grades

    With the help of Soviet experts, China's iron and steel smelters have successfully trialed more than ten types of heat-resistant steel and stainless steel. Among these new steel grades, some are stainless steel for manufacturing steam turbine and turbine blades; some are acid-resistant steel for manufacturing engine exhaust system nozzles and collectors, or for manufacturing advanced welding rods; some are heat-resistant steel that can be used to manufacture engine valve grids, piston rods, and withstand high temperatures and pressures; and another is a special heat-resistant steel.

    The successful trial production of these new products will not only gradually meet the needs of China's industrial construction and save foreign exchange; at the same time, it will also improve the production technology level of China's metal smelting industry and lay a preliminary foundation for the production of advanced alloy steel.

    In order to meet the needs of national industrial construction, China's iron and steel smelting departments must continue to produce more varieties of heat-resistant steel and stainless steel.

    我国试制成功许多新钢种
    我国钢铁冶炼厂在苏联专家帮助下，已试制成功了十多种耐热钢和不锈钢。在这些新钢种里，有几种是制造汽轮机和涡轮机叶片的不锈钢；有几种是制造发动机排气系统的喷管和集合器，或制造高级电焊条的耐酸钢；有几种是能制造发动机气门网、活塞杆和承受高温高压的耐热钢；另外还有一种是特种耐热钢。
    这些新产品试制成功后，不但可以逐步供应我国工业建设的需要，节省了外汇；同时，也使我国金属冶炼工业的生产技术水平提高了一步，为生产高级合金钢奠定了初步基础。
    为了满足国家工业建设的需要，我国的钢铁冶炼部门还要继续生产更多品种的耐热钢和不锈钢。
