Respected Premier, Comrades, Friends:

Today, the Korean people are solemnly celebrating the tenth anniversary of the liberation of Korea. The delegation of the People's Republic of China, entrusted with the mission by the Government of the People's Republic of China, the Central Committee of Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, extends warm congratulations and fraternal greetings to you and, through you, to all the Korean people.

Ten years ago, the heroic Soviet army defeated Japanese militarism. With the help of the Soviet army, the Korean people were freed from the shackles of Japanese colonial rule, thus opening a new era in Korean history.

In the past ten years, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Comrade Kim Il-sung, the Korean people and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, through arduous and complex struggles, have achieved tremendous accomplishments in politics, economy, and culture, building North Korea into a strong democratic base for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and have achieved a great victory in the more than three-year-long just war against aggression.

Since the Korean armistice, the Korean people have been selflessly working to heal the serious wounds of war. The Korean people have completed preparations for the post-war recovery and development of the people's economy and are now striving for the victorious completion of the Three-Year Economic Plan.

This spirit of perseverance and indomitability of the Korean people has set a brilliant example for all peace-loving people in the world, and at the same time, once again demonstrated to the world that the people who have taken the fate of their country into their own hands cannot be conquered by any force.

The friendship between the great Soviet people and the Korean people is a powerful guarantee for the Korean people to overcome all difficulties and move towards victory. The victory of the Korean armistice was achieved with the warm sympathy and support of the great Soviet Union and peace-loving people and countries all over the world. The selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries to the Korean people has accelerated the construction cause of the Korean people.

The Chinese people cherish fraternal love and respect for the Korean people. The Chinese people cherish every victory and achievement of the Korean people as they cherish their own victorious achievements. The Chinese people are proud to have such a heroic fraternal neighbor as Korea.

Comrade Kim Il-sung is absolutely right when he says: "The friendship and unity between the peoples of Korea and China were formed and developed long ago in the struggle against common enemies."

In the three-year just war of the Korean people against foreign aggression, the Chinese people fought side by side with the Korean people, further strengthening the friendship and unity between the two peoples. The victory of the Korean people not only defended the interests of the Korean nation, but also guaranteed China's peaceful construction and security. The great patriotism and internationalism of the Korean people inspire the Chinese people's enthusiasm for building socialism and defending world peace.

The two visits to China by the Korean government delegation headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the respected leader of the Korean people, and the signing of the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement on November 23, 1953, marked a major development in the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Korea.

The Chinese people will, as in the past, continue to provide full support and assistance to the Korean people in their cause of striving for the peaceful reunification of their motherland and restoring and developing the national economy.

Two years ago, the achievement of the Korean armistice eased international tensions to some extent since the Second World War and opened the way for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue.

The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Korean people have consistently worked to consolidate the Korean armistice and strive for the peaceful reunification of Korea. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have consistently abided by and maintained the armistice agreement. At the Geneva Conference in 1954, the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, together with the delegations of the Soviet Union and China, made sincere and great efforts for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, but failed to reach an agreement due to the obstruction of the United States and other participating countries. Since then, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Korean people have repeatedly put forward practical and feasible proposals for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, but have consistently failed to receive a corresponding response. On the contrary, the Syngman Rhee clique in South Korea, manipulated by foreign aggressor forces, has consistently been hostile to the Korean armistice and openly advocated resuming the Korean War. They have been pursuing a policy of keeping the Korean armistice in an unstable state. They have been trying their best to create all kinds of incidents and provocations that violate and undermine the armistice agreement, and obstruct the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission responsible for supervising the Korean armistice. Recently, the Syngman Rhee clique even openly declared its readiness to seize the area north of the military demarcation line and south of the 38th parallel, and demanded that the institutions and personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission withdraw from South Korea within a time limit. In response, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued statements on August 11, respectively, pointing out that this is a serious action attempting to directly undermine the Korean armistice agreement, and if it is not stopped, it will bring extremely serious consequences.

The Korean armistice agreement is related to peace and security in Korea and the Far East. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is an indispensable institution for ensuring the armistice and supervising the strict observance of the armistice terms by both sides of the armistice, and no one should be allowed to undermine them. If the provocateurs want to undermine the Korean armistice agreement and the normal work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, they must bear all the serious consequences caused by their actions. We have every reason to demand that all relevant countries and peace-loving people around the world stand up to stop the Syngman Rhee clique's conspiracy to undermine the armistice agreement and threaten the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. And the United States, which signed the armistice agreement on behalf of the United Nations forces, bears an unshirkable responsibility for this.

Recently, thanks to the initiatives taken by the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries, the international situation has eased to some extent. The summit conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France held in Geneva in July this year has brought positive results for the cause of peace and provided an encouraging prospect for resolving outstanding international issues through consultation. If the countries concerned have the sincerity, understanding, and cooperative spirit to solve various pressing international problems, then the Korean issue should not be ignored, and effective measures should be actively taken to consolidate the Korean armistice and seek the realization of the peaceful reunification of Korea. We believe that it is absolutely necessary for the countries concerned to hold a Far East conference with the broad participation of Asian countries to discuss the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea.

At today's celebration meeting, Premier Kim Il-sung put forward positive proposals on the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea. These proposals fully conform to the strong desire of the Korean people for peaceful reunification and fully conform to the interests of peace in the Far East and the world. The Chinese people fully agree with these proposals and give them full support.

We believe that the entire Korean people, with their united efforts, and with the support of peace-loving people and countries all over the world, will surely overcome all difficulties and victoriously complete the sacred cause of peaceful reunification of their motherland.

Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea! Long live the Korean Workers' Party!

### 朱德副主席的讲话

专栏：

    朱德副主席的讲话敬爱的首相同志，同志们，朋友们：
    今天，朝鲜人民隆重地庆祝朝鲜解放十周年，中华人民共和国代表团受中华人民共和国政府、中国共产党中央委员会和毛泽东主席的委托，代表全体中国人民，向你们并通过你们向全体朝鲜人民致热烈的祝贺和兄弟的敬礼。
    十年前，英勇的苏联军队打垮了日本军国主义。朝鲜人民在苏联军队的帮助下摆脱了日本殖民统治的枷锁，从而开辟了朝鲜历史上的新时代。
    十年来，朝鲜人民和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在朝鲜劳动党和金日成同志的领导下，经过艰苦复杂的斗争，在政治、经济、文化各方面获得了巨大的成就，把朝鲜北部建设成为一个为和平统一自己祖国的坚强的民主阵地，并且在历时三年多的反侵略的正义战争中取得了伟大的胜利。
    朝鲜人民在朝鲜停战以后，又以忘我的劳动医治着沉重的战争创伤。朝鲜人民已经完成了战后恢复和发展人民经济的准备工作，目前正在为三年经济计划的胜利完成而努力奋斗。
    朝鲜人民的这种坚苦卓绝和不屈不挠的精神，已经为世界上一切爱好和平的人民树立了光辉的榜样，同时也再一次向全世界显示：已经把国家的命运掌握在自己手中的人民，是任何力量所不能征服的。
    伟大的苏联人民和朝鲜人民之间的友谊，是朝鲜人民战胜一切困难走向胜利的强有力的保证。朝鲜停战的胜利是在伟大的苏联和全世界爱好和平的人民和国家的热烈同情和支持之下取得的。苏联和各人民民主国家给予朝鲜人民的无私援助，又加速了朝鲜人民的建设事业。
    中国人民对朝鲜人民怀着兄弟般的友爱和敬意。中国人民像珍贵自己的胜利成果一样珍贵朝鲜人民的每一个胜利和成就。中国人民因为有朝鲜这样一个英雄的兄弟邻邦而自豪。
    金日成同志说得完全对：“朝中两国人民的友谊团结是很早以来就在反对共同敌人的斗争中结成和发展的。”
    在朝鲜人民反对外国侵略的三年正义战争中，中国人民和朝鲜人民并肩作战，从而进一步加强了两国人民之间的友谊和团结。朝鲜人民的胜利不仅捍卫了朝鲜民族的利益，同时也保证了中国的和平建设和安全。朝鲜人民伟大的爱国主义和国际主义的精神，鼓舞着中国人民建设社会主义、保卫世界和平的热情。
    以朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成同志为首的朝鲜政府代表团的两次访问中国，以及一九五三年十一月二十三日中朝经济及文化合作协定的签定，标志着中朝两国友好合作关系的重大发展。
    中国人民将像过去一样，继续对朝鲜人民争取祖国和平统一、恢复和发展国民经济的事业给予全力的支持和援助。
    两年前，朝鲜停战的达成，使得第二次世界大战以后的国际紧张局势开始有了和缓，并且为和平解决朝鲜问题开辟了道路。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和朝鲜人民一贯为巩固朝鲜停战和争取朝鲜的和平统一而努力。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军一贯遵守和维护停战协定。在一九五四年日内瓦会议上，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团同苏联和中国的代表团一起为和平解决朝鲜问题作了真诚的巨大努力，但是由于美国和其它与会国家的阻挠而未能达成协议。此后，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和朝鲜人民又一再提出切实可行的和平统一祖国的建议，但是始终没有获得相应的反应。相反的，在外国侵略势力操纵下的南朝鲜李承晚集团却一贯敌视朝鲜停战，公开鼓吹恢复朝鲜战争。他们一直奉行着使朝鲜停战处于不稳定状态的政策。他们竭力制造各式各样的违反和破坏停战协定的事件和挑衅，阻挠负责监督朝鲜停战的中立国监察委员会的工作。最近李承晚集团竟公然宣称准备夺取军事分界线以北、三八线以南的地区，并要求中立国监察委员会的机构和人员限期撤出南朝鲜。对此，中华人民共和国外交部和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省已于八月十一日分别发表声明，指出这是一个企图直接破坏朝鲜停战协定的严重行动，如果不加以制止，必将带来极其严重的后果。
    朝鲜停战协定关系着朝鲜和远东的和平和安全。中立国监察委员会是保证停战、监督停战双方严格遵守停战条款的不可或缺的机构，不能容许任何人对它们加以破坏。挑衅者如果想使朝鲜停战协定和中立国监察委员会的正常工作遭到破坏，他们必须对其行动所引起的严重后果负一切责任。我们完全有理由要求一切有关的国家和全世界爱好和平的人们，起来制止李承晚集团破坏停战协定、威胁中立国监察委员会的阴谋活动。而代表联合国军在停战协定上签字的美国对此更负有不可推卸的责任。
    最近以来，由于苏联和其它爱好和平的国家所采取的主动，国际局势已经有了一定程度的和缓。今年七月在日内瓦举行的苏、美、英、法四国首脑会议为和平事业带来了积极的结果，也为以协商方式解决国际间悬而未决的问题提供了令人鼓舞的前景。如果各有关国家具有诚意，本谅解和合作的精神来解决各项迫切的国际问题，那就不应置朝鲜问题于不顾，而应积极采取有效措施，巩固朝鲜停战并进而谋求朝鲜和平统一的实现。我们认为，有关国家举行一次有亚洲国家广泛参加的远东会议，来讨论和平统一朝鲜问题是十分必要的。
    在今天的庆祝大会上，金日成首相对朝鲜和平统一问题提出了积极的主张。这些主张是完全符合朝鲜人民要求和平统一的强烈愿望的，也是完全符合远东和世界和平的利益的，中国人民完全同意这些主张，并全力给以支持。
    我们相信，全朝鲜人民以自己团结一致的努力，在全世界爱好和平的人民和国家的支持下，一定能够排除万难，胜利地完成和平统一自己祖国的神圣事业。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！朝鲜劳动党万岁！
