Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 6th: As previously reported, the Soviet government sent a note to the government of the Federal Republic of Germany on June 7th, proposing the establishment of direct diplomatic, trade, and cultural relations between the two countries, and inviting the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Adenauer, to visit Moscow to discuss this issue.

The Federal Republic of Germany submitted a reply note on June 30th, expressing agreement to discuss the establishment of diplomatic, trade, and cultural relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, and related issues, according to the Soviet proposal. The reply note stated: Under the current circumstances, the government of the Federal Republic of Germany believes it is best to first decide the issues that should be covered in this discussion and determine the order of reviewing these issues. Therefore, it is suggested that informal talks be held between the embassies of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union in Paris to clarify these issues.

On August 3rd, the Soviet Embassy in France delivered a note from the Soviet government through the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany in Paris. The note stated that the Soviet government is satisfied to note that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany has expressed its agreement to discuss the establishment of diplomatic, trade, and cultural relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, and to study issues related to this.

The Soviet government believes that these negotiations between delegations from the governments of the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany can be held at the end of August or the beginning of September this year, provided that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany agrees to this date.

The following issues can be discussed during the talks:

    On the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany and the exchange of corresponding documents;

    On the establishment of trade relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany and the conclusion of a trade treaty;

    On the establishment and development of cultural ties between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany and the conclusion of corresponding treaties for this purpose.

The Soviet government's starting point is that the issue of establishing diplomatic, trade, and cultural relations between the two countries should naturally not be subject to any preconditions from either side.

The note concludes by stating that it does not object to the exchange of views in advance by the embassies of the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany in Paris on the issues to be discussed and studied in the Moscow negotiations. The Soviet side will be represented by the Soviet Ambassador to France, S.A. Vinogradov, in this exchange of views.

    就苏联同西德建立外交、贸易和文化关系的谈判问题
    苏联政府再次照会德意志联邦共和国政府
    新华社六日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科五日讯：前已报道，苏联政府曾在六月七日照会德意志联邦共和国政府，建议两国建立直接的外交、贸易和文化关系，并且邀请德意志联邦共和国总理阿登纳访问莫斯科，以便就这一问题进行讨论。
    德意志联邦共和国六月三十日提出覆照，表示同意根据苏联建议讨论关于苏联同德意志联邦共和国建立外交、贸易和文化关系以及有关的问题。覆照说：在目前情况之下，德意志联邦共和国政府认为最好首先决定这次讨论所应涉及的问题，并且确定审查这些问题的次序。因此建议由德意志联邦共和国和苏联两国驻巴黎大使馆举行非正式会谈，以便明确这些问题。
    八月三日苏联驻法国大使馆通过德意志联邦共和国驻巴黎大使馆递交苏联政府的照会一份。照会说，苏联政府满意地注意到：德意志联邦共和国政府表示同意讨论关于苏联同德意志联邦共和国建立外交、贸易和文化关系的问题以及研究与此有关的问题。
    苏联政府认为，苏联和德意志联邦共和国两国政府代表团的这一谈判可以在今年八月底、九月初举行，只要德意志联邦共和国政府同意这一日期。
    双方会谈时可以讨论下列问题：
    关于苏联同德意志联邦共和国建立外交关系以及交换相应的文件的问题；
    关于苏联同德意志联邦共和国建立贸易关系以及缔结贸易条约的问题；
    关于苏联同德意志联邦共和国建立和发展文化联系以及为此而缔结相应的条约的问题。
    苏联政府的出发点是，两国建立外交、贸易和文化关系的问题当然不受任何一方的任何先决条件的影响。
    照会最后表示不反对由苏联和德意志联邦共和国驻巴黎的大使馆事先就莫斯科谈判所应讨论和研究的问题交换意见。苏联方面将由苏联驻法国大使斯·阿·维诺格拉多夫参加这次交换意见。
