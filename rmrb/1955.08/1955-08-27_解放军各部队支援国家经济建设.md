　　PLA Units Support National Economic Construction

　　(Our report) The People's Liberation Army units are actively supporting the country's economic construction from all aspects.

　　After completing the construction task of the Li-Zhan Railway ahead of schedule, the Railway Corps immediately participated in the construction project of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway. Now they are concentrating their efforts on carrying out construction along the entire line, striving to complete the task on schedule or ahead of schedule. After completing the full line opening task of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways at the end of last year, some troops continued to carry out the repair work of certain sections of the highway this year, and another part of the troops has begun to build the highway from Yangbajing to Rikaze. The agricultural production units stationed in Xinjiang have expanded the cultivated area this year, planting wheat, cotton, oil crops, and miscellaneous grains on 1.12 million mu of land, and expanding animal husbandry. In July, hundreds of thousands of mu of spring wheat have been harvested, increasing a large amount of grain income for the country.

　　The troops stationed in various places often use various methods to help local people develop production. Many troops constantly spare time to help local farmers cultivate land, deliver manure, sow seeds, and harvest crops while performing heavy training tasks. In June, the troops stationed in Shenyang completed the overhaul of a canal project in the northern part of Shenyang City through voluntary labor days. The commanders and fighters worked hard on the construction site 14 kilometers away from the urban area, in knee-deep mud, using 30,686 workdays to build a canal 2,770 meters long, and the project was fully up to standard. In order to help people of all ethnic groups develop production, the Xinjiang Agricultural Production Corps has successively lent more than 61,000 jin of spring wheat, cotton, corn and other seeds and more than 8,000 pieces of various agricultural tools, and helped farmers plow, sow, irrigate, and reclaim more than 18,000 mu of land; the troops also transferred a large number of cadres and agricultural technicians to various places to help establish agricultural production cooperatives and serve as agricultural technical guidance. The troops stationed in the Kangzang Plateau and the Yunnan border often enthusiastically help fraternal ethnic groups repair canals, build houses, harvest crops, and carry out other daily labor.

　　The PLA units stationed in coastal areas actively assist fishermen in developing production. At the beginning of the fishing season in the coastal areas of Fujian this spring, the troops and the local government's aquatic products departments formulated a fishing protection plan, the coastal artillery increased the duty firepower, and the naval vessels also frequently dispatched patrols and escorted fishing boats. After the liberation of Dachen and other islands in the coastal area of Zhejiang, the PLA soldiers actively helped the robbed people repair houses and repair fishing gear, so that they could resume production as soon as possible.

　　In the production increase campaign of the people in various places, the PLA commanders and fighters actively protect production and prevent sabotage by counter-revolutionaries and natural disasters. The public security troops stationed in industrial and mining areas and along transportation lines strictly implement guard duties, and bravely assist in eliminating serious accidents and disasters in some units. In the rescue, some comrades even sacrificed their lives. When drought occurred in Guangdong this spring, many troops stationed in Guangdong stopped their exercises and mobilized to help farmers dig wells, carry water, and open canals. A certain unit dug 669 wells for the masses and watered more than 2,700 mu of land in twelve days.

　　In order to support the country's economic construction, the PLA units are making great efforts to practice economy in the consumption of grain and other materials and in the expenditure of funds. The troops stationed in the Qinghai area have saved more than 540,000 jin of grain in the past year. After a certain motor vehicle detachment on the Fujian front launched a labor competition for driving safety and saving fuel and materials, it saved a large amount of fuel for the country in half a year, and the number of vehicles for major and medium repairs was also reduced by 76%. The logistics departments of all troops have carried out material inventory, strengthened storage work, and avoided unnecessary losses and waste.

　　解放军各部队支援国家经济建设
    本报讯　人民解放军各部队从各方面积极地支援国家的经济建设事业。
    铁道兵部队提前完成了黎湛铁路的修建任务后，立即又参加了鹰潭到厦门铁路的修建工程。现在他们正集中力量在全线展开施工，争取按期或提前完成任务。修筑康藏、青藏公路的部队在去年底完成全线通车任务后，今年部分部队继续进行公路某些地段的整修工作，另一部分部队已开始修筑羊八井到日喀则的公路。驻新疆的农业生产部队今年扩大了耕种面积，在一百十二万亩土地上种了小麦、棉花、油料、杂粮等作物，并扩展了牧畜事业。七月间，几十万亩的春小麦已经收割完毕，为国家增加了一大批粮食收入。
    驻各地部队经常以各种办法来帮助当地人民发展生产。许多部队在执行繁重的训练任务中还不断抽出时间帮助当地农民耕地、送粪、播种和收割。驻沈阳部队曾在六月间用义务劳动日包修完成了沈阳市北部的一条明渠工程。指战员们在远离市区十四公里的工地上，在没膝的泥水中艰苦劳动，用了三万零六百八十六个工，修成了长达二千七百七十公尺的渠道，工程完全合乎标准。新疆农业生产部队为帮助各族人民发展生产，曾先后借出春麦、棉花、包谷等种籽六万一千多斤和各种农具八千多件，并帮助农民犁地、播种、灌溉、开垦土地一万八千多亩；部队又抽调了大批的干部和农业技术人员到各地帮助建立农业生产合作社，担任农业技术指导工作。驻康藏高原和云南边疆的部队，更经常热心地帮助各兄弟民族修渠、盖房、收割庄稼和进行其他日常劳动。
    驻沿海地区的解放军部队，积极协助渔民发展生产。今年春天福建沿海鱼汛期开始时，部队和当地政府水产部门订立了护渔计划，海岸炮兵增设了值班炮火，舰艇部队也经常出动巡逻和护送渔船。浙江沿海大陈等岛屿解放后，解放军战士们积极帮助被劫人民收拾房屋、修补渔具，使他们尽快地恢复生产。
    在各地人民的增产运动中，解放军指战员们积极保护生产，防止反革命分子的破坏和自然灾害。驻工矿地区和交通沿线的公安部队，严格地执行守卫任务，并奋不顾身地协助消灭了某些单位的严重事故、灾害。在抢救中，有的同志甚至牺牲了自己的生命。今年春天广东旱象发生时，驻广东的许多部队停止了操课，全体动员起来，帮助农民挖井、担水、开渠。某部在十二天中就给群众挖井六百六十九口，车水浇田二千七百多亩。
    为了支援国家的经济建设，解放军各部队在粮食及其它物资的消费上，在经费开支上都在大力实行节约。驻青海地区的部队近一年来节约的粮食就有五十四万多斤。福建前线某汽车分队开展行车安全和节省油料、器材的劳动竞赛后，半年来共为国家节省了大量的油料，大修和中修的车辆也减少了百分之七十六。各部队后勤部门都进行了物资的清理，加强了保管工作，避免了不必要的损耗和浪费。
