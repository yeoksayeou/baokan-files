　　Strengthen trade union construction, closely connect trade unions with the masses, and strive to victoriously complete the country's first five-year plan
　　— Report at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (Approved by the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions)
　　Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
　　The Second Session of the First National People's Congress has officially approved the first Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, which is an extremely important event in our country's history. The completion of the first Five-Year Plan will establish a preliminary foundation for our country's socialist industrialization. With the completion of this plan, the lives of our country's working class and all the people will be further improved, and a good foundation will be laid for a better life in the future. More than two years have passed since the first Five-Year Plan was implemented, and the plan for the past two years has been successfully completed, but the tasks for the next two years are more arduous. The work of our trade unions, since the Seventh National Congress of Trade Unions in 1953, has been, and will continue to be, to strive to complete the country's first Five-Year Plan and to build our country into a great socialist country. Mobilizing and organizing all employees to complete and strive to overfulfill the country's first Five-Year Plan is the fundamental goal of all trade union work.
　　In order to more effectively mobilize and organize all employees to complete and strive to overfulfill the country's first Five-Year Plan, trade union organizations at all levels must widely publicize the first Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy.
　　Our country's first Five-Year Plan is formulated according to the requirements of the Party's general line during the transition period, that is, the country's general task during the transition period. It is a major step in building our country into a great socialist industrial power.
　　Industrial construction is the center of our country's first Five-Year Plan, and the construction of heavy industry occupies the most important position in industrial construction. The 694 above-quota projects, including the 156 projects designed with the sincere and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, are the focus of our first Five-Year Plan. We must make great efforts to complete the construction plan for these key projects.
　　Completing key projects and putting these key projects into production one after another is by no means solely the responsibility of the employees of these projects themselves, but the responsibility of all employees in the country. During the first Five-Year Plan period, 70% of the industrial output value still has to be completed by relying on existing equipment. Therefore, in order to support key construction projects and comprehensively realize the first Five-Year Plan, it is of great significance to maximize the potential of existing enterprises.
　　Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and with the sincere and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, as long as the working people of the whole country unite and work hard, we will definitely be able to successfully realize this great Five-Year Plan. But this does not mean that there are no difficulties on our way forward. No, there are difficulties, and there will be many. Overcoming these difficulties depends especially on the efforts of the working class. All employees must highly develop the glorious tradition of hard work of the working class, follow the instructions of Chairman Mao Zedong, be conscientious and meticulous, overcome difficulties, and strive to increase production and practice strict economy. As long as we work hard in this way, we will definitely be successful.
　　A consolidated worker-peasant alliance is the basic guarantee for realizing the Five-Year Plan and the basic guarantee for the victory of the socialist revolution. All employees and trade union cadres must always pay attention to unity with the peasants and do what they can in the process of constantly consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.
　　Trade union organizations must repeatedly publicize the above-mentioned principles to every employee and his family so that they can be truly understood by every employee and employee's family. Only in this way can all employees be mobilized to strive for the victorious completion of the first Five-Year Plan.
　　Labor emulation is the basic method to fully utilize the enthusiasm and creativity of all employees, continuously improve labor productivity, and complete the state plan. Trade union organizations must strive to push labor emulation to a new upsurge.
　　Trade unions also have a major responsibility for the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts, especially for the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Strengthening trade union work in capitalist industry and commerce is an aspect that trade unions must pay attention to in the process of realizing the Five-Year Plan.
　　During the transition period, the class struggle will inevitably become increasingly acute and complex. Trade union organizations must educate all employees to be vigilant, oppose all conspiracies of domestic and foreign enemies, eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and oppose the various forms of sabotage activities of bourgeois elements against us.

　　I. Push Labor Emulation to a New Upsurge

　　The first Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy states: "More than two-thirds of the output value increased by state-owned industries in 1957 compared with 1952 will come from improving labor productivity. Within five years, every 1% increase in the labor productivity of all state-owned industries is equivalent to approximately 18,282 yuan of output value." It also points out: "Labor emulation is a regular and effective method to improve labor productivity, and should be continuously pushed to a new upsurge." This is completely correct. We must mobilize all employees to actively respond to this call from the government, continuously push labor emulation to a new upsurge, and continuously improve labor productivity to ensure the successful realization of the Five-Year Plan.
　　1954 was a year of relatively active labor emulation. Labor emulation has been widely carried out throughout the country, gradually becoming regularized, and has begun to accumulate some experience.
　　Learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, promoting China's advanced experience, and carrying out rationalization proposals have attracted widespread attention and have achieved considerable results. In terms of rationalization proposals alone, according to national statistics for 1954, the number of employees who made rationalization proposals reached more than 580,000, and the number of rationalization proposals submitted reached more than 848,600, of which more than 463,000 have been adopted and implemented. These figures fully demonstrate the labor enthusiasm and creativity of the masses.
　　Mass production meetings have become a system in many factories and mining enterprises, which have played a great role in exposing and criticizing shortcomings in production and solving problems in production.
　　In 1954, on the basis of labor emulation within factories and mining enterprises, inter-factory emulation achieved new development. Regional and industry-specific inter-factory emulation played a positive role in promoting all aspects of enterprise work. In the first half of 1955, regional inter-factory emulation of the same type of work was also very active, which is important for spreading advanced production experience and improving work efficiency.
　　In the first quarter of 1955, many provinces and cities and certain industries conducted the work of evaluating and selecting labor models for 1954. Judging from the situation in various places, the evaluation and selection of labor models is a mass inspection and a powerful promotion for labor emulation.
　　Collective contracts are an important foundation of trade union work and a concrete manifestation of the combination of national interests and mass interests. Signing and implementing collective contracts can powerfully promote the development and deepening of labor emulation.
　　Collective contracts have achieved new development in 1954, especially in 1955. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 600 units across the country that have signed collective contracts. For these more than 600 units, we should actively help them and pay attention to summarizing their good experiences and promoting them.
　　In the second half of 1954, team economic accounting appeared in a few enterprises. Team economic accounting can promote the masses to establish an "economic accounting" concept of thrift and economy, specifically master economic indicators, and analyze the economic activities of the team, discover problems in production, and thus use the wisdom of the masses to solve these problems. We must attach importance to this experience, earnestly develop this experience, and gradually promote it.
　　In recent years, labor emulation has made great progress and accumulated some experience, but the problems existing in the current labor emulation are still many. The main problem is that formalism is quite common. When some enterprises hold employee representative meetings and mass production meetings to discuss production and financial plans, they do not seriously listen to the opinions of the masses, but leading cadres make lengthy reports. At mass meetings, these plans are only formally passed, rather than seriously discussed, and a clear direction for the emulation is proposed according to the requirements of the plan, guiding the masses to solve the main problems in their work. Many trade union organizations lack in-depth and meticulous ideological work, so they cannot mobilize the masses of employees more widely and give full play to the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses. Many trade union organizations (including the All-China Federation of Trade Unions) lack concrete organizational work for labor emulation: they rarely take measures to help employees overcome specific difficulties in achieving guarantee conditions; they do not pay enough attention to or are not serious enough in summarizing advanced experience; the policy of learning technology, improving technology, and mastering new technologies is not widely implemented, so overtime work is widespread; the phenomenon of neglecting material incentives is quite serious, and there are many problems in wage and bonus work; in inter-factory emulation, some enterprises have relaxed specific guidance on intra-factory emulation. All these problems are the causes of formalism. In labor emulation and in other work, if we do not strengthen concrete organizational work, we can only circle around in form. In order to overcome formalism in labor emulation and push labor emulation to a new upsurge, we must pay attention to the following issues in the future:
　　First, strengthen political and ideological work in labor emulation, and earnestly and systematically publicize the first Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, and educate employees to treat labor and public property with a communist attitude and consolidate labor discipline. Promote the glorious tradition of hard work of the Chinese working class, resist the ideological erosion of the bourgeoisie, and overcome various difficulties in completing the state plan.
　　Second, in labor emulation, we must conscientiously implement the policy of learning technology, improving technology, and mastering new technologies, strive to learn and promote Soviet experience, promote China's effective experience, and carry out rationalization proposals. After the slogan of "technical innovation" was cancelled, many enterprises have relaxed their work on rationalization proposals to some extent. Since the second quarter of 1955, the number of rationalization proposals has decreased significantly, and many units do not recognize the great significance of improving technology, raising technology, and learning and mastering new technologies for the development of production. It must be pointed out once again that the development and improvement of labor emulation is inseparable from the improvement and improvement of production technology. The cancellation of the slogan "technical innovation" is because it cannot accurately and completely summarize the nine proposals made by Comrade Zhang Mingshan and other seven comrades, but it does not mean that it is wrong to improve and improve production technology. On the contrary, improving and improving technology and learning and mastering new technologies are extremely important tasks for the Chinese working class during the entire period of national construction. The main content of the nine proposals made by Comrade Zhang Mingshan and other seven comrades is also about this aspect. Although the slogan "technical innovation" has been cancelled, the nine proposals of Comrade Zhang Mingshan and other seven comrades must be adhered to. The Sixth Meeting of the Presidium of the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions also pointed this out when cancelling the slogan "technical innovation."
　　Third, in labor emulation, we must create various conditions for employees to complete guarantee conditions and help workers overcome specific difficulties in completing guarantee conditions. We must give practical help to backward employees and backward units. Advanced leading backward, and giving comradeship help to the backward, so that they gradually improve to the advanced level, is a fundamental principle and fundamental requirement of labor emulation. At present, the specific work in this area is not done well enough.
　　Fourth, we must attract engineering and technical personnel and staff to participate in labor emulation. In recent years, most trade union organizations have paid attention to the work of engineering and technical personnel and staff, but in labor emulation, they have not given full play to the initiative and enthusiasm of engineering and technical personnel and staff, and many engineering and technical personnel and staff are still standing outside the emulation ranks. The work of mobilizing engineering and technical personnel and staff to help workers complete competition guarantee conditions, put forward rationalization proposals, and summarize advanced experience has not been done well enough. At present, some engineering and technical personnel do not conscientiously implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, and even refuse to implement the suggestions of experts, and do not actively support the rational initiatives of the masses, and even suppress them. These all show that trade union organizations are still weak in uniting and educating engineering and technical personnel and staff. Trade union organizations must patiently conduct ideological education work for engineering and technical personnel and staff, and educate workers to take the initiative to unite them and cooperate well with them.
　　Fifth, we must implement the principle of material incentives. At present, many enterprises do not pay enough attention to wages and bonuses, and there are many unreasonable phenomena in wages and quotas; many enterprises lack necessary material rewards for advanced producers. If this situation is not changed, it will not be possible to give full play to the labor enthusiasm and creative spirit of the masses, and maintain it regularly. It should be pointed out that trade union organizations at all levels have begun to pay attention to these issues in the past six months, and there has been some progress in the wage work of the masses, but the problems in wages and bonuses have not yet been basically resolved, and the problems are still serious. Trade union organizations at all levels must systematically study the issues of wages and bonuses and put forward appropriate suggestions to the relevant government departments and enterprise administrations.
　　Sixth, we must gradually establish a system of honorary awards. The title of labor model is of great significance for commending advanced people, leading backward people, and encouraging employees to actively participate in labor emulation. However, for the awarding of the title of labor model, the education and management of labor models, etc., there has not been a unified regulation and a unified method for several years, and there are some chaotic phenomena. The Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is studying this issue and preparing to submit a proposal to the government.

　　II. Strengthen Trade Union Work in Capitalist Industry and Commerce

　　Comrade Li Fuchun pointed out in the report on the first Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy that "within five years, capitalist industry and commerce will be gradually incorporated into the track of state capitalism through various methods such as joint state-private ownership, processing and ordering, agency sales, and distribution, so as to lay the foundation for the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce." This is an extremely complex and arduous task. It must be pointed out that the various transitional forms adopted for the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce are an economic alliance implemented by the working class and the bourgeoisie under special historical conditions, and also a special form of struggle between the working class and the bourgeoisie during the transition period. In this extremely sharp and complex class struggle, trade union organizations have a major responsibility. In order to ensure the realization of the tasks related to the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in the Five-Year Plan, we must resolutely support and implement the government's policies and decrees on the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.
　　In 1953 and 1954, trade union organizations at all levels assisted the government in successfully completing the state's transformation plan for capitalist industry and commerce.
　　In private industries with processing and ordering tasks, the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee has been generally established, and the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement has been carried out. Through the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, the enterprise management system has been improved, the supervision of the workers has been strengthened, and the necessary conditions have been prepared for joint state-private ownership.
　　In 1954, the number of joint state-private enterprises increased a lot. In the process of joint venture, many trade union organizations deeply mobilized the workers and actively supported the representatives of the public shares. Many trade union organizations helped the representatives of the public shares to understand the situation before the joint venture, promoted the capitalists to apply for joint venture; after the joint venture, they assisted the representatives of the public shares to clear up assets, verify funds, arrange personnel, change systems, and launch competitions, so as to ensure the successful completion of the joint venture plan and production tasks.
　　In the process of carrying out the socialist transformation of capitalist commerce by industry, many trade union organizations convened employee representative meetings by industry, listened to the opinions of the workers, dispelled some of the workers' concerns, and also helped the government solve some specific problems.
　　In 1954, in some capitalist industries and commerce, the activities of bourgeois lawbreakers resisting socialist transformation were even more prominent: the five poisons, strikes, stopping meals, arrears of wages, and releasing sugar-coated bullets, flattering employees, and dividing the unity of the working class were very common. It must be pointed out that with the development of socialist transformation, the class struggle will inevitably become more complex and acute. Therefore, we must educate employees, raise vigilance, and oppose various forms of attacks by the bourgeoisie.
　　In the past two years, in the process of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, trade union work has also accumulated some experience, but there are still many problems. The main problems are as follows:
　　First, some trade union cadres do not have enough understanding of the complexity and acuteness of the class struggle in capitalist industry and commerce and joint state-private enterprises, and do not have enough vigilance against various forms of struggle by bourgeois lawbreakers to sabotage and resist socialist transformation, especially in joint state-private enterprises, they are not vigilant against the bourgeois elements' attempt to seize leadership and sabotage secretly. Many trade union cadres and employees cannot resist the ideological erosion of the bourgeoisie, have been fooled by the capitalists, and even helped the capitalists to do some bad things. The phenomenon of impure trade union organizations in private enterprises is still quite serious.
　　Second, in some processing and ordering factories, the role of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee has not been fully exerted, mass supervision is very weak, so the quality of products is low, waste is serious, overtime is widespread, safety and health conditions are not good, and casualties are generally much more serious than state-owned enterprises.
　　Third, in capitalist commerce, the number of industries with distribution and agency sales is increasing. It is an important responsibility of shop employee trade unions to mobilize shop employees to strictly supervise capitalists to abide by various regulations on distribution and agency sales, improve business management, and balance enterprise income and expenditure. However, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has not paid enough attention to this aspect of work for a long time, so that this aspect of work is very weak, which cannot but have a certain impact on the speed of realizing socialist transformation.
　　The above-mentioned problems must be gradually resolved. The primary problem is to strengthen leadership in this area, strengthen class education for workers, and purify trade union organizations, especially purify the leadership organizations of trade unions.

　　III. Strengthen the Supervisory Role of Trade Unions, Oppose Various Waste Phenomena and Bureaucratic Phenomena

　　At the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, Comrades Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian both emphasized the waste phenomena in factories and mining enterprises and called on the people of the whole country, especially the workers, to fight against these waste phenomena. Therefore, in labor emulation, on the one hand, we must comprehensively pay attention to increasing output, improving quality, successfully trial-producing new products, gradually promoting team economic accounting, strictly saving raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity, paying attention to the maintenance and repair of tools and machines, extending the service life of tools and machines, and striving to reduce product costs, so as to improve labor productivity in all aspects. On the other hand, we must also give play to the supervisory role of trade unions, that is, the mass supervision from bottom to top, and fight against all phenomena of corruption, waste, fraud, violation of laws and regulations, and bureaucracy that violate national interests and the interests of the working class. We must attract the broad masses to participate in enterprise management, improve enterprise management, and ensure the implementation of the Party and state policies and decrees through mass supervision.
　　Trade union organizations should educate the masses and supervise the enterprise administration to correctly implement the state production and financial plan; correctly implement labor protection laws and regulations related to safety technology and industrial hygiene; correctly use state appropriations to improve employees' working conditions; correctly expend wage funds in accordance with the state plan; and correctly implement the wage system and use enterprise bonus funds.
　　For the following phenomena that are quite common at present, we should especially give play to the supervisory role of the masses and assist the enterprise administration to overcome them.
　　First, many enterprises (basic construction units and production units), on the one hand, have a surplus of labor force, and the phenomenon of idleness and work stoppage is serious, and on the other hand, they have a large amount of overtime. The result of a large amount of overtime and rushing to catch up with work damages the health of workers, increases production accidents, affects product quality, overspends the wage fund, and forms a great waste of manpower, material resources, and financial resources.
　　Second, labor discipline must continue to be strengthened, and violations of labor discipline must be overcome. However, in the work of consolidating labor discipline, we must prevent the tendency of punitivism. The strengthening of labor discipline must be based on the consciousness of the masses, and the main method of strengthening labor discipline must be persuasion and education. In 1953, an education to consolidate labor discipline was generally conducted among workers. In July 1954, the Government Affairs Council promulgated the Outline of Labor Rules within State-Owned Enterprises, which played a positive role in consolidating labor discipline. However, around the time this outline was promulgated, especially in the process of implementing this outline, punitivism grew. Some enterprises casually expelled workers, or often used expulsion to threaten workers; individual enterprises (such as Guizhou Tobacco Factory) even confined workers, locking up workers who violated labor discipline in the personnel department to reflect. A few enterprises also held struggle meetings against workers injured on the job, asking workers to confess why they were injured, and only allowed them to talk about subjective reasons, not objective reasons. Many trade union cadres turned a blind eye to these phenomena, did not object to them, and even participated in them.
　　Third, many enterprises have frequent production accidents. Some units have accepted lessons from experience, listened to the opinions of the masses, and taken concrete measures to solve many problems; however, there are also some units that have not taken effective measures to improve in the event of frequent accidents. There are also some units that do not seriously study and analyze the causes of accidents, often simply attributing the causes of accidents to workers, unilaterally punishing workers, and not checking the responsibility of the leadership, or only making self-criticism without improvement.
　　Without the supervision of the masses, the above-mentioned problems cannot be solved well.
　　Regarding the supervision of trade unions, that is, the supervision of the masses, we must clarify it ideologically.
　　First, we must distinguish between the supervision of trade unions in socialist enterprises and the supervision in capitalist enterprises. These two types of supervision are of different natures. In capitalist enterprises, because there are classes, the workers and capitalists belong to two hostile classes, so mass supervision is a way for the working class to fight against the bourgeoisie and a way to carry out socialist transformation of capitalist enterprises. In socialist enterprises, there is no class antagonism. Although mass supervision contains criticism and struggle, in nature, it is a way to attract the masses to participate in enterprise management, a way to rely on the masses to overcome shortcomings and improve work, and a way to improve the initiative and enthusiasm of workers and cultivate construction talents. Therefore, supervision of the enterprise administration is effective assistance to the enterprise administration.
　　Second, trade union supervision (that is, mass supervision) does not replace the supervision of the Party and the state, but helps the Party and the state to supervise those phenomena of corruption, waste, bureaucracy, violation of laws and regulations, and violation of the interests of the working class. Its purpose is to implement the policies and decrees of the Party and the state and protect the interests of the working class. Therefore, the supervision of trade unions can only play a full role under the leadership of the Party.
　　Trade union supervision is by no means passive. Trade unions should not only fight against those phenomena of corruption, waste, bureaucracy, violation of the policies and decrees of the Party and the state, and violation of the interests of the working class, but also put forward positive suggestions for improving work and assist the enterprise administration to improve work.
　　Trade unions must organize mass supervision, and at the same time, all the work of trade unions must be placed under the supervision of the masses. If the trade union itself does not have strict mass supervision, then it cannot effectively organize the masses to help the Party and the state to supervise the enterprise administration.
　　In short, relying on the masses to run enterprises well must be specific, not just empty talk. The so-called relying on the masses is not only relying on the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses to do a good job in production, but also relying on the supervision of the masses to improve work.

　　IV. Systematically Conduct Workers' Spare-Time Cultural and Technical Education

　　Actively carrying out socialist construction and socialist transformation and building our country into a great socialist industrial country is first and foremost the responsibility of the working class. If the working class is to shoulder this great historical task, it must have a high degree of awareness and organization, and it must have a certain level of culture and technology. Without a certain technical level, we cannot master complex modern technology, and we cannot well shoulder the task of building modern industry. But without a certain level of culture, we cannot effectively improve technology. At the same time, improving culture also helps to improve political level. At present, the biggest weakness of the working class in our country is the backward cultural and technical level, which is one of the major difficulties in our country's construction period. Of course, this problem cannot be completely solved in a short period of time. But under the wise leadership of the Party and with the help of the Soviet Union, as long as we work hard, we will definitely be able to gradually make the Chinese working class a class with a high level of culture and technology.
　　In recent years, although we have done a lot of work to improve the cultural and technical level of workers and have achieved some results, this work is not systematic enough and not regular enough. In the past, spare-time cultural education generally focused on eliminating illiteracy, which is of course also necessary. But in addition to eliminating illiteracy, we must systematically improve the cultural and technical level of the workers. In the past, there were very few middle schools and only individual universities in the spare-time schools we ran, and the courses in primary and middle schools were also incomplete. In the future, we must systematically run spare-time primary schools, middle schools, and universities, and the courses in these spare-time schools must be basically the same as those in regular primary schools, middle schools, and universities. This work is a long-term work, and we cannot expect to see great results quickly, but as long as we carry it out actively and tirelessly, the results will be great after more than ten or decades. Although this work is mainly the responsibility of the government education department, trade union organizations also have a great responsibility.
　　Regarding technical education, in addition to mass education (such as master teaching apprentices, mutual teaching and mutual learning, technical seminars, technical lectures, technical performances, technical exhibitions, etc.), we must also assist the enterprise administration to run spare-time secondary technical schools and technical training courses in a planned way.
　　In order to systematically conduct regular spare-time cultural and technical education, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is studying and formulating some specific methods with relevant parties. After these methods are announced, trade union organizations at all levels must take concrete measures to implement them. To do this work well, the most important issue at present is to ensure students' study time. In factories and mining enterprises, those who are willing to study seriously should mainly use their spare time for study. The phenomenon of arbitrarily encroaching on their spare time must be reversed.

　　V. Improve Trade Union Leadership, Improve Trade Union Ideological Style, and Strengthen Trade Union Ties with the Masses

　　The Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions once determined the policy and tasks of trade union organizations during the period of national construction. In the past two years, we have implemented the resolutions of the Seventh National Congress, achieved certain results, and accumulated certain experience. However, this experience is incomplete and unsystematic and cannot meet objective requirements. The problems in our work are still many. In order to ensure the completion of the first Five-Year Plan, we must further improve trade union leadership, improve trade union ideological style, strengthen trade union work in all aspects, and strengthen trade union ties with the masses.
　　Improving trade union ideological style is a current central link in improving the entire trade union work. Many trade union organizations have serious bureaucracy in their ideological style, so generally speaking, the ties between trade union organizations and the masses are not close enough, or in other words, many trade union organizations have the phenomenon of being divorced from the masses. This phenomenon is very serious in a few units. If we do not overcome this phenomenon of being divorced from the masses and strengthen trade union ties with the masses, we cannot mobilize and organize the broad masses of workers to consciously contribute all their strength and wisdom to the completion of the first Five-Year Plan.
　　The bureaucracy of trade union organizations in ideological style is mainly manifested in the treatment of the masses. Many trade union organizations do not care enough about the material and cultural life of the workers. There are many problems in the lives of the masses that should be solved and can be solved, but trade union organizations rarely take active measures to help the masses solve these problems. We have many requirements for the masses, but we provide little help to the masses. This situation is bound to affect the relationship between trade unions and the masses. Of course, since liberation, with the recovery and development of the national economy, the material and cultural life of the masses of workers has been greatly improved. Under the current economic conditions in our country, when our country is concentrating its main strength on economic construction, the living standards of workers cannot and should not be raised very high. In fact, the masses do not have this excessive demand. But there are many problems in the lives of the masses that can be solved. The reason why these problems have not been properly solved is mainly because of the shortcomings in our work and because of the bureaucracy in our work style. In many factories and mining enterprises, on the one hand, state appropriations for workers' welfare are accumulated, and on the other hand, many urgent problems that need to be solved by the masses of workers have not been solved for a long time. Therefore, trade union organizations must supervise the use of state appropriations for improving workers' living conditions and working conditions, so that these appropriations can play their due role. Trade union organizations must also use labor insurance funds and membership hardship subsidies well under the supervision of the masses, and conscientiously run mutual savings associations well. At present, mutual savings associations in many units have not been conscientiously rectified and developed, and "biao hui" and "qing hui" are quite common, which shows that the masses need mutual assistance, and mutual assistance can also solve problems. The problem is that we have not conscientiously carried out this work.
　　Of course, trade union organizations have also run some collective welfare undertakings, and these collective welfare undertakings have also played a certain role. However, many collective welfare undertakings are also divorced from the actual living standards and actual needs of the masses. Many sanatoriums, rest homes, clubs, cultural palaces, nurseries, etc. are built very grandly and decorated very luxuriously, spending a lot of money, but the problems that the masses really need to solve are not solved much. It should be pointed out that it is good to run welfare undertakings, but it is wrong to run these undertakings not according to the needs of the masses and the living standards of the masses, but only according to the subjective ideals of the cadres. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions is responsible for this issue. Trade union organizations at all levels must run these undertakings according to the needs of the masses, strictly abide by the national construction standards for living facilities, and try to set them up at the grassroots level, based on the principles of being applicable, economical, and convenient for the masses.
　　In the treatment of the masses, there is also a tendency of commandism. Many trade union cadres do not treat the masses with a comradely attitude, do not carry out work with the method of persuasion and education, but treat the masses with a superior attitude and carry out work with coercive methods. This tendency is particularly prominent in dealing with so-called backward elements.
　　All trade union workers must be reminded at all times: trade unions are mass organizations voluntarily organized by the masses, they are organizations of the masses themselves, trade union cadres are elected by the masses to do things for the masses, and trade union workers are also members of the masses; trade unions are also a link between the Party and the masses and are faithful executors of the Party's policies. Trade union organizations and trade union workers must, on the one hand, actively publicize the Party's policies and propositions,
　　On the one hand, according to the ideological emotions and requirements of the masses, patiently educate the masses and gradually raise the ideological understanding of the masses to the level of the Party's policies. To achieve this requirement, we must carry out arduous and meticulous work. Only by improving the masses can we closely unite the masses, and the thinking of the masses can never be improved by commandism. All the work of trade unions must adopt the method of attracting and inducing, and must be based on the consciousness and willingness of the masses. If we treat the masses and so-called backward elements with a rude attitude, we will inevitably suffer setbacks and failures.
　　Trade union organizations must give full play to democracy, report work to the masses regularly, report financial income and expenditure, re-elect regularly, carry out criticism from the bottom up, and put all work under the supervision of the masses. Leadership organs at all levels of trade unions must strictly implement the system of collective leadership. This democratic spirit of trade unions must be implemented in all its work and guaranteed organizationally. Trade union organizations must strengthen grassroots work and team work with the greatest strength and rely on the broad activists to carry out various tasks. Only in this way can all the work of trade unions be built on a solid foundation.
　　The team is the cell organization of the trade union. Without sound team work, there will be no sound grassroots work. Trade union team meetings and team production meetings should be distinguished. Team production meetings are necessary. Team production meetings mainly solve specific problems in production. They do not have fixed members. They can absorb relevant employees to participate as needed. However, in addition to team production meetings, trade union life meetings must also be held regularly. It is wrong to replace life meetings with team production meetings. Trade union life meetings should become meetings for publicizing the Party's policies, reflecting the situation of members in production, life, and ideology, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and checking work. This kind of meeting does not have to be held often, but it needs to be held once a month.

　　加强工会建设，密切工会与群众的联系，为胜利地完成国家的第一个五年计划而奋斗
　　——在中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会第三次全体会议上的报告（中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会第三次全体会议通过）
　　中华全国总工会主席　赖若愚
    第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议已经正式通过了发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，这在我国历史上是一件极其重大的事情。第一个五年计划的完成，将给我国的社会主义工业化建立一个初步的基础。随着这个计划的完成，我国工人阶级和全体人民的生活，也将得到进一步改善，并且给将来更美好的生活打下一个良好的基础。第一个五年计划已经过去两年多了，过去两年多的计划已经胜利完成了，但是今后两年多的任务是更加艰巨的。我们工会的工作，从一九五三年工会第七次全国代表大会以来就是，今后仍然是为完成国家的第一个五年计划而努力，为把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而努力。动员和组织全体职工完成并争取超额完成国家的第一个五年计划，这是工会一切工作的根本目标。
    为了更有效地动员和组织全体职工完成并争取超额完成国家的第一个五年计划，工会各级组织必须广泛地宣传发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。
    我国第一个五年计划是根据党在过渡时期的总路线，即国家在过渡时期的总任务的要求而制定的，它是把我国建设成为伟大的社会主义工业国的一个重大步骤。
    工业建设是我国第一个五年计划的中心，在工业建设中重工业的建设占最重要的地位。包括苏联真诚无私地帮助我们设计的一五六项工程在内的六九四项限额以上的工程，就是我们第一个五年计划的重点。我们必须以极大的努力来完成这些重点工程的建设计划。
    完成重点工程，并且把这些重点工程陆续投入生产，这绝不仅仅是这些工程本身的职工的责任，而是全国职工的责任。在第一个五年计划期间，百分之七十的工业产值，还是要依靠现有设备来完成的，因此，为了支援重点建设工程，为了全面地实现第一个五年计划，极大地发挥现有企业的潜力是有重大意义的。
    在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的英明领导下，在苏联真诚无私的帮助下，只要全国劳动人民团结一致，努力奋斗，我们就一定能够胜利地实现这个伟大的五年计划。但是这并不是说，在我们前进的道路上没有困难。不，困难是有的，而且会是很多的。这些困难的克服，特别有赖于工人阶级的努力。全体职工必须高度发扬工人阶级艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，遵照毛泽东主席的指示，兢兢业业，克服困难，努力增产，厉行节约。只要我们努力这样作，我们就一定能够胜利。
    巩固的工农联盟是实现五年计划的基本保证，也是社会主义革命胜利的基本保证。全体职工和工会干部必须时刻注意与农民的团结，在不断地巩固工农联盟的过程中，做到自己所能够做的事情。
    工会组织必须反复地向每一个职工及其家属宣传上述这些道理，使它为每一个职工以及职工家属所真正理解。这样，才能够动员全体职工为胜利地完成第一个五年计划而奋斗。
    劳动竞赛是充分发挥全体职工的积极性和创造 性、不断地提高劳动生产率、完成国家计划的基本方法。工会组织必须努力把劳动竞赛推向新的高涨。
    对于农业、手工业的社会主义改造，特别是对于资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，工会也有重大责任。加强资本主义工商业中的工会工作，是实现五年计划过程中工会必须注意的一个方面。
    在过渡时期，阶级斗争必然要日益尖锐和复杂起来，工会组织必须教育全体职工提高警惕，反对国内外敌人的各种阴谋，清除一切暗藏的反革命分子，反对资产阶级分子对我们的各种形式的破坏活动。
    一、把劳动竞赛推向新的高涨
    发展国民经济的第一个五年计划中提出：“国营工业一九五七年比一九五二年增加的产值中，有三分之二以上是从提高劳动生产率而来的。五年内，全部国营工业劳动生产率每提高百分之一的内容，约等于一八、二八二万元的产值。”又指出：“劳动竞赛是提高劳动生产率经常的有效的方法，应该不断地把劳动竞赛推向新的高涨。”这是完全正确的。我们必须动员全体职工，积极响应政府的这一号召，不断地把劳动竞赛推向新的高涨，不断地提高劳动生产率，保证五年计划的胜利实现。
    一九五四年是劳动竞赛比较活跃的一年，劳动竞赛已经在全国普遍开展起来，逐渐走向经常化，并且开始积累了一些经验。
    学习苏联先进经验，推广我国的先进经验，开展合理化建议，已经引起了普遍的重视，并且取得了不少成绩。单就合理化建议来说，据一九五四年全国的统计，提合理化建议的职工人数达五十八万多人，提出的合理化建议达八十四万八千六百多件，其中已经采纳执行的达四十六万三千多件。这些数字充分表现了群众的劳动热情和创造能力。
    群众生产会议在许多厂矿企业中已经形成了制度，它对于揭发与批评生产中的缺点，解决生产中的问题，都起了很大的作用。
      一九五四年，在厂矿企业内部劳动竞赛的基础上，厂际竞赛有了新的发展。地区性的、同产业的厂际竞赛，对于推动企业各方面的工作，起了积极的作用。一九五五年上半年，地区性的厂际同工种竞赛也很活跃，这对传播先进生产经验和提高工作效率有重要作用。
    在一九五五年第一季度，许多省市和某些产业，都进行了评选一九五四年劳动模范的工作。从各地情形来看，评选劳动模范对于劳动竞赛，是一个群众性的检查，也是一种有力的推动。
    集体合同是工会工作的重要基础，也是国家利益和群众利益结合起来的具体表现。签订和实施集体合同，可以有力地推动劳动竞赛的开展和深入。
  一九五四年特别是一九五五年，集体合同有了新的发展。据不完全的统计，全国已经订立集体合同的单位有六百多个。对于这六百多个单位，应该积极地加以帮助，并且注意总结它们的好的经验，加以推广。
      一九五四年后半年，在少数企业单位中，出现了班组经济核算。班组经济核算可以促使群众树立起“精打细算”的节约观点，具体掌握经济指标，并对本班组经济活动进行分析，发现生产中的问题，从而发挥群众的智慧来解决这些问题。我们必须重视这种经验，把这种经验认真地加以发展并逐步地推广起来。
    几年来，劳动竞赛有很大发展，也积累了一些经验，但是目前劳动竞赛中存在着的问题依然是很多的，主要的问题是形式主义相当普遍。有些企业在召开职工代表会议和群众生产会议讨论生产财务计划的时候，不是认真地听取群众的意见，而是领导干部作冗长的报告。在群众会议上只是形式地通过这些计划，而不是认真地讨论这些计划，根据计划的要求提出明确的竞赛方向，引导群众去解决工作中的主要问题。许多工会组织缺乏深入细微的思想工作，因而不能把职工群众更广泛地发动起来，高度地发挥群众的积极性和主动性。许多工会组织（包括全国总工会在内），对劳动竞赛缺乏具体的组织工作：很少采取措施来帮助职工群众克服实现保证条件的具体困难；对先进经验的总结不够重视、不够认真，学习技术、改进技术、掌握新技术的方针相当普遍地贯彻不够，因而加班加点现象大量存在；忽视物质鼓励的现象相当严重，工资奖励工作中存在着许多问题；有些企业在厂际竞赛中，放松了厂内竞赛的具体指导。所有这些问题，都是形式主义滋长的原因。在劳动竞赛中和在其他工作中一样，如果不加强具体的组织工作，就只能在形式上打圈子。为了克服劳动竞赛中的形式主义，把劳动竞赛推向新的高涨，今后必须注意以下几个问题：
    第一、加强劳动竞赛中的政治思想工作，要切实地、系统地宣传发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，教育职工群众以共产主义态度对待劳动，对待公共财产，巩固劳动纪律。发扬中国工人阶级艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，抵制资产阶级的思想侵蚀，克服完成国家计划中的各种困难。
    第二、劳动竞赛中必须认真贯彻学习技术、改进技术、掌握新技术的方针，努力学习与推广苏联经验，推广我国行之有效的经验，开展合理化建议。在取消了“技术革新”的口号以后，许多企业单位对于合理化建议工作有些放松，一九五五年第二季度以来，合理化建议的数量有显著的减少，许多单位对改进技术、提高技术、学习与掌握新技术对发展生产的重大意义认识不够。必须再一次指出，劳动竞赛的发展和提高是与生产技术的改进和提高不可分离的。“技术革新”这个口号的取消，是因为它不能够确切地、完全地概括张明山等七位同志所提的九条建议，而不是说改进与提高生产技术是不对的。相反的，改进与提高技术，学习与掌握新技术，是中国工人阶级在整个国家建设时期一个极端重要的任务。张明山等七位同志所提的九条建议的主要内容也是关于这方面的。“技术革新”的口号虽然取消了，但是张明山等七位同志的九条建议是必须坚持的。全国总工会第七届执行委员会主席团第六次会议在取消“技术革新”口号的时候，也同时指出了这一点。
    第三、在劳动竞赛中必须为职工群众完成保证条件创造各种条件，帮助工人群众克服完成保证条件的具体困难。对于落后职工和落后单位，更要给予切实的帮助。先进带动落后，对于落后的予以同志般的帮助，使他们逐步地提高到先进的水平，这是劳动竞赛的一个根本原则和根本要求。目前这方面的具体工作，是做得很不够的。
    第四、必须吸引工程技术人员和职员参加劳动竞赛。近年来，多数工会组织对工程技术人员和职员的工作已经引起重视，但在劳动竞赛中，还没有很好地发挥工程技术人员和职员的主动性和积极性，不少工程技术人员和职员仍然站在竞赛行列之外。发动工程技术人员和职员帮助工人完成竞赛保证条件、提出合理化建议、总结先进经验等方面的工作，都做得很不够。目前，还有些工程技术人员不认真执行苏联专家的建议，甚至拒绝执行专家的建议，对群众的合理倡议不予积极支持，甚至加以打击。这些都说明工会组织对工程技术人员和职员的团结、教育工作还是薄弱的。工会组织必须耐心地对工程技术人员和职员进行思想教育工作，并教育工人主动地团结他们，和他们很好地合作。
    第五、必须贯彻物质鼓励的原则。目前许多企业对于工资、奖励工作重视不够，在工资和定额方面存在着很多不合理的现象；许多企业单位对于先进生产者缺乏必要的物质奖励。这种情形如不加以改变，就不能够把群众的劳动热情和创造精神充分地发挥起来，并经常保持下去。应当指出，工会各级组织近半年来对于这些问题已开始重视，群众工资工作也有了一些进步，但是工资、奖励方面的问题，还远未得到基本的解决，问题依然是严重的。工会各级组织对于工资、奖励问题，必须系统地加以研究，向政府有关部门和企业行政方面提出适当的建议。
    第六、必须逐步地建立荣誉奖励制度。劳动模范的称号对于表扬先进、带动落后、鼓励职工积极参加劳动竞赛，是有重大意义的。可是，关于劳动模范称号的授予、劳动模范的教育管理等问题，几年以来还没有一个统一的规定和统一的办法，存在着某些混乱现象。对于这个问题，全国总工会书记处正在研究，准备向政府提出一个建议来。
　　二、加强资本主义工商业中的工会工作
    李富春同志在关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告中提出“五年内资本主义工商业将经过公私合营、加工订货、代销、经销等等方式而被逐步地纳入国家资本主义的轨道，为私营工商业的社会主义改造建立基础。”这是一个极为复杂而艰巨的任务。必须指出，对于资本主义工商业的社会主义改造所采取的各种过渡形式，是工人阶级同资产阶级在特殊历史条件下所实行的一种经济联盟，也是过渡时期工人阶级同资产阶级进行斗争的一种特殊形式。在这个极为尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，工会组织有着重大的责任。为了保证五年计划中有关资本主义工商业的社会主义改造任务的实现，我们必须坚决支持和贯彻政府对资本主义工商业社会主义改造的政策、法令。
    一九五三年和一九五四年，工会各级组织协助政府胜利地完成了国家对资本主义工商业的改造计划。
    在有加工订货任务的私营工业中，已经较普遍地建立了增产节约委员会，开展了增产节约运动。通过增产节约运动，改善了企业管理制度，加强了工人群众的监督，为公私合营准备了或准备着必要的条件。
    一九五四年，公私合营的企业增加很多。在合营过程中，许多工会组织都深入地发动了职工群众，积极地支持了公股代表。许多工会组织，在合营前，帮助公股代表了解情况，推动资本家申请合营；合营以后，协助公股代表清理资产，核定资金，安排人事，改变制度，发动竞赛，从而保证了合营计划和生产任务的胜利完成。
    在按行业对资本主义商业进行社会主义改造的过程中，许多工会组织按行业召开了职工代表会议，听取了职工群众的意见，解除了职工群众的一些顾虑，也帮助政府解决了一些具体问题。
    一九五四年，在部分资本主义工商业中，资产阶级不法分子抗拒社会主义改造的活动是更加突出了：五毒行为、停工、停伙、拖欠工资、施放糖衣炮弹，对职工阿谀逢迎，分化工人阶级团结等现象甚为普遍。必须指出，随着社会主义改造的发展，阶级斗争必将更加复杂尖锐。因此，必须教育职工，提高警惕，反对资产阶级各种形式的进攻。
    两年来，在资本主义工商业的社会主义改造过程中，工会工作虽然也积累了一些经验，但问题还是不少的，主要的问题有下面这些：
    第一、有些工会干部对资本主义工商业和公私合营企业中的阶级斗争的复杂性和尖锐性认识不够，对不法资产阶级分子破坏、抗拒社会主义改造的各种斗争形式没有足够的警惕，特别在公私合营企业中，对于资产阶级分子争夺领导权和暗中破坏的行为警惕性不高。不少工会干部和职工不能抵制资产阶级思想侵蚀，上了资本家的当，甚至帮助资本家做了些坏事。在私营企业中工会组织不纯的现象还是相当严重的。
    第二、在部分加工订货的工厂中，没有充分发挥增产节约委员会的作用，群众监督很薄弱，因而产品质量低，浪费现象严重，加班加点现象大量存在，安全卫生条件不好，伤亡事故一般比国营企业严重得多。
    第三、在资本主义商业中，经销、代销的行业日益增多，发动店员，严格监督资本家遵守经销、代销的各种规章，改进经营管理，平衡企业收支，这是店员工会的重要责任。可是全国总工会对这方面的工作长期重视不够，以致这方面的工作显得异常薄弱，这对实现社会主义改造的速度不能没有一定的影响。
    上述这些问题，必须逐步加以解决，首要的问题是加强这一方面的领导，加强职工群众的阶级教育，纯洁工会组织，特别是纯洁工会的领导组织。
　　三、加强工会的监督作用，反对各种浪费现象和官僚主义现象
    在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上，李富春同志和李先念同志的报告中都强调地指出了目前厂矿企业的浪费现象，并且号召全国人民首先是职工群众，向这些浪费现象进行斗争。因此，在劳动竞赛中，一方面，必须全面地注意增加产量，提高质量，成功地试制新产品，逐步推行班组经济核算，严格地节省原料、材料、燃料、电力，注意工具、机器的维护与修理，延长工具、机器的使用年限，努力降低产品成本，从各个方面来提高劳动生产率。另一方面，还必须发挥工会的监督作用，即群众的自下而上的监督作用，向一切违反国家利益和工人阶级利益的贪污浪费、弄虚做假、违法乱纪、官僚主义等现象进行斗争。必须通过群众监督，来吸引广大群众参加企业管理，改进企业管理工作，保证党和国家政策法令的贯彻。
    工会组织应当教育群众，监督企业行政正确地执行国家生产财务计划；正确地执行有关安全技术、工业卫生等劳动保护法令；正确地使用改善职工劳动条件的国家拨款；正确地按照国家计划开支工资基金；正确地执行工资制度和使用企业奖励基金。
    对于目前相当普遍存在着的以下的几种现象，尤应发挥群众的监督作用，协助企业行政方面加以克服。
    第一、许多企业单位（基本建设单位和生产单位），一方面劳动力有剩余，窝工、停工现象严重，另一方面又大量加班加点。大量加班加点、突击赶工的结果，损害了工人的健康，增加了生产事故，影响了产品质量，超支了工资基金，形成人力、物力、财力的很大浪费。
    第二、劳动纪律必须继续加强，违反劳动纪律的现象必须克服。但是，在巩固劳动纪律的工作中，必须防止惩办主义的倾向。劳动纪律的加强必须以群众的自觉为基础，加强劳动纪律的主要方法必须是说服教育。一九五三年，曾经在职工群众中普遍进行过一次巩固劳动纪律的教育，一九五四年七月，政务院颁布了国营企业内部劳动规则纲要，对巩固劳动纪律起了积极的作用。可是正在这个纲要颁布前后，特别是在执行这个纲要的过程中，滋长了惩办主义。有些企业随便开除工人，或者经常以开除来恐吓工人；个别企业单位（如贵州烟厂）甚至禁闭工人，把违反劳动纪律的工人关在人事科反省。少数企业单位对待因工负伤的工人也开斗争会，要工人坦白自己为什么负伤，并且只准说主观原因，不准说客观原因。不少工会干部都对这些现象不只熟视无睹、不加反对，甚至也参与其事。
    第三、许多企业单位生产事故频繁。有些单位接受了经验教训，听取了群众意见，采取了具体措施，解决了很多问题；可是也有一些单位在事故频频发生的情况下，还没有采取有效措施加以改进。还有些单位对发生事故的原因不认真地进行研究分析，往往把事故发生的原因简单地推到工人身上，片面地处罚工人，而不检查领导方面的责任，或者是只作检讨而不加改进。
    如果没有群众的监督，上述这些问题是不能很好解决的。
    关于工会的监督问题，亦即群众监督问题，必须从思想上把它弄清楚。
    首先，必须区别工会在社会主义企业中的监督和在资本主义企业中的监督。这两种监督是有性质的差别的。在资本主义企业中，因为有阶级存在，职工群众和资本家属于两个敌对的阶级，所以群众监督是工人阶级对资产阶级斗争的一种方式，也是对资本主义企业进行社会主义改造的一种方式。在社会主义企业里是没有阶级对抗的，群众的监督虽然包含着批评与斗争，但是从性质上说，它是吸引群众参加企业管理工作的一种方式，是依靠群众克服缺点、改进工作的一种方式，也是提高职工群众的主动性和积极性、培养建设人才的一种方式。所以对于企业行政方面的监督，也就是对于企业行政方面的有效协助。
    其次，工会监督（即群众监督），并不代替党的监督和国家的监督，而是帮助党和国家对那些贪污浪费、官僚主义、违法乱纪的现象进行监督的，它的目的是贯彻党和国家的政策法令，保护工人阶级的利益。所以工会的监督必须在党的领导之下才能充分发挥作用。
    工会的监督也绝不是消极的，工会不只要对那些贪污浪费、官僚主义、违犯党和国家的政策法令、违反工人阶级利益的现象进行斗争，同时还应当提出积极的改进工作的建议，协助企业行政方面改进工作。
    工会要组织群众的监督，同时工会的一切工作也必须放在群众的监督之下。如果工会本身没有严格的群众监督，那末，它也就不能够有效地组织群众帮助党和国家对企业行政方面进行监督。
    总之，依靠群众办好企业，必须是具体的，而不能是一句空话。所谓依靠群众，不仅是依靠群众的积极性、创造性来搞好生产，还要依靠群众的监督来改进工作。
　　四、系统地进行职工的业余文化、技术教育
    积极地进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造，把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义工业国，这首先是工人阶级的责任。工人阶级要担负起这个伟大的历史任务，就必须有高度的觉悟程度和组织程度，就必须有一定的文化水平和技术水平。没有一定的技术水平，就不能掌握复杂的现代技术，就不能很好地担负起现代工业的建设任务来。可是如果没有一定的文化水平，我们就不能够有效地提高技术。同时，提高文化也有助于政治水平的提高。目前我国工人阶级最大的一个弱点是文化、技术水平落后，这也就是我国在建设时期的重大困难之一。当然，这个问题不是在短时期内所能完全解决的。但是在党的英明领导下，在苏联的帮助下，只要我们努力，我们就一定能够逐步地使中国工人阶级成为有高度文化水平和技术水平的阶级。
    几年以来，我们对提高职工的文化、技术水平虽然做了很多工作，也得到一些效果，但是这些工作是不够系统、不够正规的。过去的业余文化教育，一般着重在扫除文盲，这当然也是需要的。但是除了扫除文盲以外，我们还必须系统地提高职工群众的文化水平和技术水平。过去所办的业余学校，中学很少，大学只是个别的，而且小学和中学的课程也很不完全。今后必须系统地举办业余小学、中学和大学，这些业余学校的课程也必须和正规的小学、中学、大学基本相同。这个工作是一个长期的工作，不能够希望很快就见到很大效果，但是只要积极地不懈怠地进行，经过十几年或几十年之后，成绩一定会是很大的。这件工作虽然主要由政府教育部门负责，可是工会组织也有很大的责任。
    关于技术教育，除了群众性的教育（如师傅带徒弟、互教互学、技术座谈会、技术讲座、技术表演、技术展览等等）以外，还必须有计划地协助企业行政方面开办业余中等技术学校和技术训练班。
    为了系统地进行正规的业余文化、技术教育，全国总工会正在和有关方面研究拟定一些具体办法。这些办法公布以后，工会各级组织必须采取具体措施加以贯彻。要做好这一工作，目前最主要的问题在于保证学生的学习时间。在厂矿企业中，凡是愿意认真学习的，他的业余时间主要应当用在学习方面。随意侵占他们的业余时间的现象必须设法扭转。
　　  五、改善工会的领导，改进工会的思想作风，密切工会与群众的联系
    中国工会第七次全国代表大会曾经确定了工会组织在国家建设时期的方针任务。两年多以来，我们执行了第七次全国代表大会的决议，取得了一定的成绩，也积累了一定的经验。但是这些经验是不完全、不系统的，还不能适应客观的要求。我们工作中存在的问题依然是很多的。为了保证第一个五年计划的完成，必须进一步改善工会的领导，改进工会的思想作风，加强工会各方面的工作，密切工会与群众的联系。
    改进工会的思想作风，是改进整个工会工作的一个当前的中心环节。许多工会组织，在思想作风上存在着严重的官僚主义，所以一般说来，工会组织和群众的联系是不够密切的，或者说，许多工会组织有脱离群众的现象。这种现象在少数单位，甚至是很严重的。如果不克服这种脱离群众的现象，加强工会与群众的联系，我们就不能够动员和组织广大的职工群众，自觉地为完成第一个五年计划而贡献出自己的一切力量和智慧。
    工会组织在思想作风上的官僚主义，主要表现在对待群众的问题上。许多工会组织对于职工群众的物质、文化生活关心不够。群众生活上存在着很多应该解决也能够解决的问题，可是工会组织却很少采取积极的措施来帮助群众解决这些问题。我们对于群众的要求很多，而对群众的帮助却很少。这种情况就势必影响到工会与群众的关系。当然，解放以来，随着国民经济的恢复与发展，全国职工群众的物质、文化生活已经有了很大的改善。在我国目前的经济状况下，在我国正在集中主要力量进行经济建设的时候，职工的生活水平还不可能、也不应该提得很高，实际上群众也没有这种过分的要求。但是群众生活上有许多问题是能够解决的，这些问题没有得到适当解决的原因主要是由于我们工作上有缺点，由于我们工作作风上存在着官僚主义。在许多厂矿企业中，一方面积存着国家用之于职工福利的拨款，而另一方面，职工群众中许多迫切需要解决的问题，长期得不到解决。因此，工会组织必须监督国家有关改善职工生活条件和劳动条件的拨款的使用，使这些拨款发挥应有的作用。工会组织还必须在群众监督之下，用好劳动保险金和会员困难补助费，认真地办好互助储金会。目前许多单位的互助储金会没有认真地整顿与发展，而“标会”、“请会”却相当普遍地存在着，这说明群众是需要互助的，互助也是可以解决问题的，问题是我们没有认真地进行这件工作。
    当然，工会组织也举办了一些集体福利事业，这些集体福利事业也发挥了一定的作用，但是，有许多集体福利事业也是脱离群众的实际生活水平和实际需要的。许多疗养院、休养所、俱乐部、文化宫、托儿所等等，建筑得很堂皇，布置得很阔绰，花了很多钱，但是群众真正需要解决的问题却解决得不多。应该指出，举办福利事业是好的，但是，没有根据群众的需要和群众的生活水平来举办这些事业，而只是根据干部的主观理想来举办这些事业，这却是不对的。关于这个问题，全国总工会是有责任的。工会各级组织必须根据群众的需要来举办这些事业，要严格遵守国家关于生活设施的建筑标准，并且要尽量设在基层，要以适用、经济、群众方便为原则。
    在对待群众的问题上，还存在着命令主义的倾向，许多工会干部不是以同志的态度来对待群众，不是以说服教育的方法来进行工作，而是以上司的态度来对待群众，以强制的方法来进行工作。特别是在对待所谓落后分子的问题上，这种倾向尤其突出。
    必须时刻提醒所有的工会工作者：工会是群众自愿结合的群众性的组织，是群众自己的组织，工会干部是群众选举出来给群众办事的，工会工作者同时也是群众中的一员；工会又是党联系群众的引带，是党的政策的忠实的执行者。工会组织和工会工作者，必须一方面积极地宣传党的政策、主张，
  一方面根据群众的思想情绪和要求，耐心地对群众进行教育，把群众的思想认识逐步提高到党的政策的水平。要达到这个要求，就必须进行艰苦细致的工作。只有提高群众，才能够紧密地团结了群众，而群众的思想绝不是可以用命令主义的方法来提高的。工会的一切工作，必须采取吸引诱导的方法，必须建立在群众自觉自愿的基础上，如果以粗暴的态度来对待群众、对待所谓落后分子，那就必然要遭受挫折和失败。
    工会组织必须充分发扬民主，定期向群众报告工作，报告财务收支，定期改选，开展自下而上的批评，把全部工作放在群众的监督之下。工会各级领导机关，必须严格执行集体领导制度。工会的这种民主精神，必须贯彻到它的一切工作中去，并且从组织上加以保障。工会组织必须以最大的力量加强基层工作，加强小组工作，并依靠广大的积极分子来进行各项工作。只有这样，才能把工会的各项工作都建立在强固的基础之上。
    小组是工会的细胞组织，没有健全的小组工作，就不会有健全的基层工作，工会小组会议与小组生产会议应有所区别。小组生产会议是必要的，小组生产会议主要是解决生产中的具体问题，它没有固定的组成人员，它可以根据需要，吸收有关的职工参加。但是，除了小组生产会议以外，还必须定期召开工会的生活会议。以小组生产会议代替了生活会议的做法是不对的。工会生活会议应该成为宣传党的政策、反映会员在生产、生活和思想方面的情况、开展批评与自我批评、检查工作的会议。这种会议不必常开，但每月开一次是需要的。
    工会基层组织的一切工作，都必须依靠积极分子来进行，因此，工会基层组织必须继续加强积极分子的工作，特别是对积极分子的培养、训练工作。工会每次改选以后，对新选出来的干部和积极分子，都要普遍进行一次短期的业余训练，使他们懂得工会的业务和工会的工作方法，并逐步把这种训练工作形成为制度。
    关于基层干部的配备和工资问题，全总书记处已经拟定了一个方案，望执委同志们提出修正补充的意见。
    为了克服工会工作中的官僚主义作风，还必须进一步改善工会的领导。
    第一、必须经常地进行工作执行情况的检查。近两年来，全国总工会在这方面虽然做了一些工作，但很不够。由于检查工作不够，对各产业、各省市工会组织缺乏具体的指导和帮助，好的经验不能及时地系统地总结起来，工作中的缺点不能及时得到克服。这是全国总工会以至工会各级组织工作上的重大缺点之一。今后必须有计划地根据一定时期工作的要求，认真地组织执行情况的检查。此外，还可以考虑工会基层组织统一在冬季或春季进行改选，结合总结工作，开展自下而上的批评，对工会组织的工作进行全面的检查。
    第二、必须进一步深入工作，有步骤地、具体地解决各项工作中的问题。一九五三年以来，特别是一九五四年，工会各个部门的工作经过了一些整顿，有了一些进步。但是，各方面的经验都还不够完全、不够系统。多数基层的工作委员会和某些省市的部门的经常工作还没有建立起来，工作秩序还有些混乱。全国总工会、各产业工会和各省市工会组织，应当认真地把自己的部门工作切实建立起来，同时帮助基层建立经常工作，建立正常的工作秩序。
    第三、必须采取一些具体措施加强产业工会的工作。几年以来，各产业工会做了许多工作，是有成绩的，随着工会工作转向生产，随着劳动竞赛的发展，随着工作的深入，加强产业工会已经成为工会组织的普遍要求。如果不加强产业工会，我们的工作就很难提高。特别是劳动竞赛、劳动保护、工资工作，都必须按产业特点来进行工作，不加强产业工会，这些工作就很难深入。
    为了加强产业工会，就要求各产业工会根据自己的情况，订出计划，经全国总工会批准，逐步地把自己的工作系统地建立起来。各省市工会联合会，应当帮助各产业工会把他们的工作系统地建立起来。
    加强产业工会并不意味着要削弱地方工会。地方工会在过去起了很大的作用，今后仍然要起很大的作用。因为产业工会的工作需要地方工会的监督和检查，而且还有许多地方同一性的工作需要地方工会来负担。同时，地方国营企业也是大量的、分散的，产业工会也不可能完全管起来。此外，我们还有大量的资本主义企业存在，在对资本主义企业进行社会主义改造的工作中，地方工会应当担负主要的责任。但是，产业工会和地方工会如何分工协作的问题，目前尚未很好解决，需要加以研究。
    第四、必须继续整顿工会各级组织，精减机构，紧缩编制。吸引和依靠广大的积极分子进行工作，不断加强小组工作，这是工会必须遵循的组织原则。我们必须根据这条原则对工会领导机关和基层组织的编制坚决地进行整顿。目前许多工会基层组织设置了过多的脱离生产的干部，甚至有少数基层组织还成立了部、科；工会各级领导机关的编制也一般庞大，这种情况势必削弱工会的群众性，影响工会与群众的联系。所有的工会基层组织在脱产人员的编制方面，要在一九五六年内基本上达到工会法所要求的标准，从一九五六年元月起，工会干部就完全由工会自己供给。凡是有部、科的基层组织，必须撤销这些部、科，成立工作委员会。工会各级领导机关必须在党委领导下，认真精减可有可无的机构，减少层次，紧缩编制，调整干部，提高工作效率。
    总之，思想作风问题是工会目前工作中存在着的一个基本问题，不克服官僚主义作风，贯彻群众路线的作风，我们的工作就不能够前进。
　　六、提高警惕，肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，保卫社会主义建设
    在工人阶级和全国人民为实现我国第一个五年经济建设计划而奋斗的活动中，在整个过渡时期，我们必须教育全体职工时刻提高警惕，严防一切反革命分子的阴谋破坏。在整个过渡时期即社会主义革命时期，阶级斗争是异常尖锐复杂的。帝国主义和帝国主义保护下的蒋介石卖国集团，对我们进行着广泛的破坏活动，已经被消灭了的地主阶级分子在千方百计地进行报复，这是人所共知的。将要被消灭的资产阶级，也必然要日益加强它的抵抗，资产阶级中的某些顽固分子，将会和蒋介石卖国集团、地主阶级分子以及帝国主义勾结起来。这种情况是必须估计到的。
    反对胡风反革命集团的斗争开展以来所揭发的事实证明，反革命分子以各种伪装和欺骗的方式钻进了我们机关、团体、部队、学校、工厂、矿山、交通运输和商业等部门，混进了我们工人阶级队伍中来，进行着破坏和暗害勾当。几年来，在厂矿企业和交通运输企业中不断发现反革命分子造谣生事、破坏生产、制造事故、偷窃技术资料等事件，给国家造成了重大的损失。因此，工会组织和全体工会工作者必须从这些事件中吸取教训，在党的领导下动员全体职工，把目前肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子的斗争进行到底，坚决彻底地肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，纯洁工人阶级的队伍，保卫我们社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业。×　×　×
