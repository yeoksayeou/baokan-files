    Soviet People Unanimously Support the Soviet Union's Peaceful Foreign Policy
    By Our Correspondent in Moscow, Li He
    The Third Session of the Fourth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union opened today in the Grand Kremlin Palace. At the joint session of the Union Council and the Council of Nationalities, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, reported on the results of the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference. Representatives from all over the Soviet Union listened attentively to the report. When Bulganin pointed out the achievements of the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy, the entire hall repeatedly responded with bursts of applause. This vividly expressed the Soviet people's unanimous support for the peaceful foreign policy pursued by the Soviet Party and government, and strongly reflected the Soviet people's desire to ease international tensions and promote trust and cooperation between countries.
    The same sentiment is also expressed in the many letters that Soviet workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals send to the "Pravda" editorial department every day. "Pravda" today published some of these letters on a full page. The editor's note says: The Soviet people are willing to devote all their energy to peaceful construction and want to expand and strengthen the friendship between the people of all countries. The proposals put forward by the Soviet government at the Four-Power Summit Conference are in line with the interests and hopes of all the Soviet people.
    Ryabov, a steelworker at the Moscow "Sickle and Hammer" factory, said: "We Soviet people do not want war. We especially warmly congratulate the good results of the Geneva Conference. We Soviet steelworkers will spare no effort to produce more steel for the country, which is necessary for our agriculture, construction, and industry. We hope that the steel smelted by the United States, Britain, and other countries will also be used for construction instead of destruction. The Soviet Supreme Soviet will discuss the results of the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference. We Soviet people unanimously support the position of the Soviet government delegation in Geneva."
    Gromova, a female worker at the Moscow "Three Mountains" textile factory, sacrificed her son in the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942. She said: "As everyone knows, in the Soviet Union, the government and the people are united. All of us—old and young—support the policies of the government that are as close to us as our own flesh and blood. This is what we think: we must coexist with the people of all countries in the world. We firmly believe that the people of the West will no longer listen to those who like to provoke one nation against another. We workers believe that the time has come to establish normal relations between countries." Gorshkov, director of the Michurinsk Central Institute of Genetics, said: "All the people paid close attention to the work of the Geneva Conference and sincerely welcomed the results of the meeting. It is necessary for the heads of the four major powers to express their willingness to promote the relaxation of international tensions and resolve all disputes through peaceful means. Further progress is still needed in resolving international issues at the future foreign ministers' conference. The cause of peace is in the hands of the people of all countries. The stronger and more resolute the people of all countries express their will, the more the danger of a new war can be pushed away. However, the danger of war has not yet been stopped. Influential aggressive forces still exist in certain countries, and they will try to step up their conspiracies again. We Soviet people, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party, should remain vigilant in safeguarding the cause of peace."

    苏联人民一致拥护苏联和平外交政策
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    第四届苏联最高苏维埃第三次会议今天在大克里姆林宫开幕。在联盟院和民族院的联席会议上，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁报告了日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的结果。来自全苏联各地的代表们聚精会神地听取了报告。当布尔加宁指出苏联和平外交政策的成就时，全场不断报以骤雨般的掌声。在这里集中表露了苏联人民对于苏联党和政府所执行的和平外交政策的一致拥护，强烈反映了苏联人民对于缓和国际紧张局势和促进国与国之间信任合作的愿望。
    同样的情绪也表现在苏联工人、集体农民和知识分子每天寄给“真理报”编辑部的许多信件中。“真理报”今天以整版篇幅刊载了其中一些信件。编辑部按语说：苏联人民愿把全部精力贡献给和平建设，想扩大和加强各国人民之间的友谊。苏联政府在四国政府首脑会议上提出的提案是符合全体苏联人民的利益和希望的。
    莫斯科“镰刀与锤子”工厂炼钢工人里雅波夫说：“我们苏联人不要战争。我们特别热烈地祝贺日内瓦会议的良好结果。我们苏联炼钢工人不惜力量要给国家生产更多的钢铁，那是我们农业、建筑业、工业所必需的。我们希望美国、英国和其他国家炼的钢也用于建设而不是用于毁灭。苏联最高苏维埃会议将讨论日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的结果。我们苏联人一致拥护苏联政府代表团在日内瓦的立场。”
    莫斯科“三山”纺织厂女工格罗莫娃在一九四二年斯大林格勒保卫战中牺牲了自己的儿子。她说：“大家知道，在苏联，政府和人民是一致的。我们全体——老的少的——都拥护同我们骨肉相连的政府的政策。我们这样想：要和世界所有各国人民共处。我们坚信，西方人民再也不想听那些喜欢挑拨一个民族反对另一个民族的人的话了。我们工人们认为已经到了建立各国之间正常关系的时候了。”米丘林斯克中央遗传研究所所长高尔什科夫说：“全体人民密切注意了日内瓦会议的工作并且由衷地欢迎会议的结果。四大国首脑表示了准备促使国际紧张局势的和缓，经过和平途径解决一切争执，这是必要的。还需要在未来的外长会议上在解决国际问题方面再进一步。和平事业掌握在各国人民手中。各国人民越强烈、越坚决表示自己的意志，新战争的危险将越能推远。可是战争的危险还没有制止。某些国家还存在着有影响的侵略势力，它们将会企图重新加紧阴谋活动。我们苏联人，在英明的共产党领导下，在维护和平事业的时候，应当保持警惕。”
