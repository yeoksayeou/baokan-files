Since last year, the Twelfth Health Clinic in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, has organized mobile medical and prevention teams to go deep into the countryside to actively prevent and treat diseases for the farmers, ensuring their health, promoting agricultural production, and carrying out rural health work. This has fundamentally changed the past errors and shortcomings of the health clinic in terms of ideology and working methods.

In the past, the staff of the Twelfth Health Clinic lacked a clear understanding of rural health work serving agricultural production. Health personnel simply stayed in the clinic in the market town, waiting for patients to come for treatment. However, because farmers were busy with farming or the clinic was far away, they were willing to endure illnesses rather than go to the clinic for treatment. As a result, the clinic staff often had nothing to do, and rural health work was left unattended, causing much dissatisfaction among the masses. Since the winter of 1954, the Jiaohe County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Committee have attached great importance to this situation, gradually guiding the health personnel of the health clinic to establish the idea of serving agricultural production, changing the "sitting-and-waiting" work style that was detached from the masses, and correcting the erroneous perception of treating production and health work as opposing each other.

Before the spring plowing and preparatory work began last winter and this spring, the health clinic began to make full preparations ideologically, organizationally, and institutionally for carrying out this work. It studied working methods adapted to the rural cooperative movement and production needs. It divided the original medical areas of Bao'an, Daji, Bei'an, Xin'gu, and other villages and towns according to the characteristics of dispersed areas and the development of the cooperative movement. Except for the town itself, which was designated as an outpatient area under the responsibility of outpatient doctors, Bao'an and other villages were designated as mobile medical areas. A "fixed-point activation" method of mobile roaming with agricultural production cooperatives as "fixed points" was adopted, and five mobile medical and prevention stations were established in Xiangshui, Aihe, and Bao'an. To make it convenient for farmers to see a doctor, the mobile schedule was determined according to the population distribution and medical needs. The original outpatient system that restricted patients was changed, and the weekly holiday system was abolished, so that the mobile team could visit each station twice a month, each time for six or four days. Every month, each medical staff member worked in the countryside for twenty-six days, regularly and punctually carrying commonly used medicines to treat farmers on the spot, and carrying out medical prevention, hygiene and epidemic prevention, and maternal and child health work with agricultural production cooperatives as fixed points. Because the periodic and fixed-point mobile medical method has become a habit for the masses like market days, for general illnesses, the masses wait for the mobile medical team to come to their homes for treatment on a regular basis. This overcomes the shortcomings of the past where doctors could not find patients and patients could not find doctors. The farmers said that they no longer have to worry about getting sick, and the doctor will surely come to their homes. Especially during the busy farming season, when people, livestock, and vehicles are all busy with production, the farmers feel the benefits of mobile medical care more deeply. The "Happiness Road" Agricultural Production Cooperative saved more than 200 labor days by having the mobile medical team examine more than 200 people last year, allowing the cooperative to complete its production three days ahead of schedule. Since this spring, the mobile medical team has examined more than 100 people, allowing more than 100 laborers to be used for spring plowing and production. When the Dong'an Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bei'an Village was sending manure during spring plowing preparation, some members fell ill, and the cooperative director was worried. Just as the mobile medical team arrived, the cooperative director breathed a sigh of relief and said: "We were just about to hitch up the cart to send the patient to the health clinic. Your arrival saved us four workdays." During the spring plowing period, the various medical teams of the health clinic treated a total of more than 550 people, ensuring that rural labor was used for the tense spring plowing production.

The mobile medical team also combined preparation for production with the use of various meeting formats to conduct propaganda on the prevention of seasonal endemic diseases and maternal and child health knowledge, and encouraged everyone to do a good job in the patriotic health campaign. Due to the active propaganda of the mobile medical team, the masses' knowledge of hygiene and science has been improved. Everyone pays attention to personal hygiene, environmental hygiene, prevention and isolation, and rational treatment, so the occurrence and prevalence of various diseases have been gradually controlled. For example, the incidence of infantile measles has decreased by 10% compared with the past. Measles was discovered in Beigou this spring and was quickly extinguished by the mobile medical team.

With the development of the rural cooperative movement, the Twelfth Health Clinic has further focused on agricultural production cooperatives to carry out health work. The health clinic has successively signed medical and health care contracts with 20 agricultural production cooperatives such as "Happiness Road," "Nonglin," and "Yuancheng," so that rural health work is closely combined with agricultural production. Now, all cooperatives can humbly accept relevant suggestions and guidance on carrying out health work, and combine preparation for production and manure delivery to carry out large-scale cleaning campaigns, clear garbage and feces, and improve environmental hygiene. At the same time, due to the establishment of credit accounting relationships between the counties and the health clinic, the medical contract has solved the problem that members have no money to see a doctor when they are sick. Old Qiao, a 59-year-old single member of the "Yuancheng" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bei'an Village, suffered from an old illness during the busy preparation for production. He gasped and could not get out of bed all day long. According to the contract, the mobile medical team quickly cured Old Qiao's illness. He said excitedly: "Who would care about an old man like me in the past when I was sick? Now, I can get treatment at home without money." A female member said: "Now the country is so good, doctors go door-to-door to find patients. How can we not be satisfied!" Now, all agricultural production cooperatives have given the health clinic great trust. For example, the director of the "Common" Agricultural Production Cooperative said to the health clinic on behalf of all the members: "The health of our members depends on your guidance." Due to the change in the direction of the health clinic's work, the relationship between the agricultural production cooperatives and the health clinic is closer, and the feelings are deeper.

In the mobile medical work, the health personnel of the Twelfth Health Clinic carried forward the fine style of not fearing hardship and doing everything for the patients. Under the slogan of "Preventing and treating diseases, ensuring the health of farmers, delivering medicine to the door, and serving agricultural production," they always persisted in regular and fixed-point mobile medical care regardless of wind or rain or fatigue. Therefore, the health personnel have established a high reputation among the farmers.

Not long ago, the Twelfth Health Clinic shortened the interval of mobile medical care according to the needs of production, continued to tap the potential of the clinic, gave fuller play to the strength of traditional Chinese medicine, organized traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to participate in mobile medical teams, and prepared to cultivate health workers and establish grass-roots health organizations centered on agricultural production cooperatives during the slack farming season this year to better serve agricultural production.

    一个积极为农民服务的卫生所
    燕翼
    从去年开始，吉林蛟河县第十二卫生所组织了巡回医疗预防小组，深入农村积极地为农民群众防治疾病，保证了农民的身体健康，推动了农业生产，开展了农村卫生工作，基本上改变了卫生所过去在思想上、工作方法上的错误和缺点。
    过去，第十二卫生所的工作人员对农村卫生工作为农业生产服务的思想是不明确的。卫生人员只是蹲在集镇上的卫生所里，干等着病人来所治病。可是，农民因为农忙或就诊路远，有病愿意硬挺也不愿来所治疗；因此，卫生所的人员常常闲着无事干，而农村卫生工作则呈现一种无人管的状态，群众意见很多。一九五四年冬季以来，中共蛟河县委和县人民委员会非常重视这一情况，逐步引导卫生所的卫生人员树立为农业生产服务的思想，改变了
  “蹲点式”的脱离群众的工作作风，并纠正了把生产跟卫生工作对立起来看待的错误认识。
    去冬今春备耕工作尚未开始时，卫生所开始从思想上、组织上和制度上为开展这项工作作了充分的准备，研究了适应农村合作化运动和生产需要的工作方法，将原有的保安、大吉、北安、新沽等村镇的医疗区域，按地区分散的特点，按合作化运动发展等情况，除本镇划归为门诊区域由门诊医生负责外，将保安及其它村划为巡回医疗区域，采取了以农业生产合作社为“定点”的巡回流动的
  “死点活用”的方法，建立了香水、爱河、保安等五个巡回医疗预防站。为了使农民看病方便，又按人口的分布和医疗的需要，确定了巡回日程，改变了原来约束病人的门诊制度，并取消了星期休假制，使巡回组每月每站能够巡回二次，每次六天或四天。医务人员每人每月在乡下工作二十六天，定期准时地携带常备药品就地为农民治疗，以农业生产合作社为定点地开展医疗预防、卫生防疫、妇幼卫生等工作。由于定期定点的巡回医疗方法已被群众像集日似的习惯了，一般的病，群众便等着巡回医疗小组定期来家治疗，这就克服了过去大夫找不到病人，病人找不到大夫的缺点。农民们说，这回有病再也不用着急了，到时候大夫准会上家跟前来。尤其是在农忙季节，人、畜、车辆都忙于生产的时候，农民们更切身地感到巡回医疗的好处。“幸福之路”农业生产合作社去年经过巡回医疗组看了二百多人次，节省的人力、畜力共计有二百多个劳动日，使社内生产提前三天完成。今年春季以来，又经巡回医疗组看了一百多人次，使一百多个劳动力用于春耕生产。北安村东安农业生产合作社在备耕送粪时，有的社员闹了病，社主任正在发愁，恰巧巡回医疗组去了，社主任才松了一口气，说：我们正准备套车送病人去卫生所，你们一来，我们就省了四个工。在春耕期间，卫生所的各个医疗小组共治疗了五百五十多人次，保证了农村的劳动力用于紧张的春耕生产。
    巡回医疗小组还结合备耕生产，利用各种会议的形式，进行了预防季节性多发病、妇幼卫生知识的宣传，并鼓动大家搞好爱国卫生运动。由于巡回医疗小组的积极宣传，群众的卫生科学知识有了提高，大家注意了个人卫生、环境卫生、预防隔离和合理治疗，因而逐渐控制了各种疾病的发生和流行。如小儿麻疹的发病率，就较过去降低了百分之十。北沟今年春季发现了麻疹，很快就被巡回医疗组扑灭。
    随着农村合作化运动的发展，第十二卫生所进一步以农业生产合作社为重点开展了卫生工作。卫生所先后和“幸福之路”、“农林”、“远程”等二十个农业生产合作社签订了医疗保健合同，使农村卫生工作和农业生产紧密地结合起来。现在各社都能虚心地接受有关开展卫生工作的建议和指导，结合备耕、送粪开展大清扫运动，清除垃圾粪便，改善了环境卫生。同时由于各县同卫生所建立了信用记账关系的医疗合同，解决了社员们有病无钱就诊的困难。北安村“远程”农业生产合作社五十九岁的独身社员老乔头，在备耕工作繁忙时，老病发作，整天喘息不能起炕，巡回医疗小组根据合同，很快就把老乔头的病治好了。他兴奋地说：像我这样一个孤老汉，过去病了谁管呀；如今，没有钱在家里就把病治好了。有个女社员说：“现在国家多好啊，医生挨门挨户找病人，怎么不叫我们心满意足啊！”现在，各农业生产合作社对卫生所给予了莫大的信任。如“共同”农业生产合作社主任代表全体社员向卫生所表示说：“我们社员的健康要依靠你们的指导了。”由于卫生所工作方向的改变，农业生产合作社和卫生所的关系更密切了，感情更深厚了。
    在巡回医疗工作中，第十二卫生所卫生人员发扬了不畏艰苦、一切为了病人的优良作风。他们在“防治疾病、保证农民健康，把医药送上门，为农业生产服务”的口号下，不管刮风下雨，不顾劳累，始终坚持按期定点巡回。因此，卫生人员在农民群众中树立了很高的威信。
    不久以前，第十二卫生所又根据生产的需要，缩短了巡回间隔期，继续发挥所内的潜力，更广泛地发挥中医的力量，组织中医参加流动巡回医疗小组，并准备在今年农闲期内，以农业生产合作社为中心，培养保健员，建立基层卫生组织，更好地为农业生产服务。
