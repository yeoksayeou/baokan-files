△ The Xuzhou Branch of the China Animal Products Company in Jiangsu Province has been experimenting with using chemical agents such as alum and soda to make fur instead of grain. This not only ensures that the quality and specifications of the products meet the requirements, but also makes the leather soft, strong, and durable, without deteriorating even at a high temperature of 60 degrees Celsius. According to the traditional fur-making methods, each sheepskin requires an average of about one jin of grain to be processed into fur, and each operation takes seven to ten days. Switching to chemical agents not only saves grain, but also simplifies the operation, taking only three days each time. Therefore, the processing cost is also reduced by more than 8% compared to the past. If this method is universally adopted, this company can save about 10,000 jin of grain based on this year's planned processing of sheepskins and dog skins.

△ Glucose is generally made from corn or wet flour. In May of this year, the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Chemical Raw Materials Company accepted a suggestion from the masses and trial-produced solid glucose with a 70% composition from the sediment of rice water. The company immediately consulted with the mess halls of two units to collect the first wash of rice water every day in vats, add some alum to allow it to settle, and hand over the sediment to the Jincheng Chemical Industry Cooperative to manufacture glucose. The first batch of glucose made from rice water sediment, after testing, had the same composition and specifications as that made from corn. The production equipment and operating procedures of the manufacturing plant also do not need to be changed. All manufacturers of glucose can use this raw material.

△ Brewing workers in the Yue Dong District of Guangdong Province use the residue filtered out during the local production of brown sugar to brew sugar foam wine. Every 100 jin of residue can brew 14 to 18 jin of 40-proof sugar foam wine. Sugar foam wine can be made into Wu Jiapi wine and green plum wine. In the Jinhua area of Zhejiang Province, using sugar foam to brew wine saved 320,000 jin of grain last year.

△ The State-owned Jinan Alcohol General Factory uses black mold instead of yellow mold for making koji for fermentation, which increases the starch-to-alcohol conversion rate. Koji made with black mold has strong heat resistance and acid resistance. During the fermentation and saccharification process, the same raw materials produce 15% more sugar with black mold koji than with yellow mold koji, resulting in 1.16 jin more alcohol per 100 jin of raw materials. According to this factory's production tasks for the second half of this year, it can save 1.04 million jin of grain in the second half of the year.

△ The Second Vegetable Processing Plant of the Shanghai Suburban Supply and Marketing Cooperative successfully used tomatoes instead of rice to make vinegar, which has low cost and good quality, saving the country a large amount of grain.

△ The Wuxi City Native Produce Company in Jiangsu Province uses green bean pulp water left over from making vermicelli instead of gluten to make white soy sauce and monosodium glutamate, which can save a large amount of flour used for making gluten.

△ Most of the more than 400 public and private soy sauce brewing factories in Beijing have eliminated caramel coloring in the soy sauce production process. If we calculate based on the city's past monthly production of 4 million jin of soy sauce, with 2 jin of caramel coloring added per 100 jin of soy sauce, then 80,000 jin of caramel coloring are now saved each month. Manufacturing this amount of caramel coloring would waste 160,000 jin of grain (2 jin of grain are required to make 1 jin of caramel coloring). Eliminating caramel coloring from soy sauce does not affect its quality (because caramel coloring itself does not increase the umami taste and aroma of soy sauce, and has no nutritional value; and in the past, soy sauce often became astringent and bitter due to excessive caramel coloring, and private merchants could also use caramel coloring to adulterate and deceive customers). The non-caramel-colored soy sauce produced in Beijing sells well and is generally welcomed by users.

△ In the first quarter of this year, eight flour mills in Jinan, Shandong Province, sorted out more than 145,000 jin of wheat and more than 27,000 jin of peas that could be milled into flour from more than 690,000 jin of "by-products."

△ The Shanghai State-owned Shanghai Flour Mill found in its analysis that wheat bran still contained flour. Technicians and workers jointly studied and added a mill and a round sieve to the wheat bran outlet process, which can sieve out more than six taels of flour from every 100 jin of wheat bran.

△ The Shanghai State-owned Fourth Rice Mill, in response to the shortcomings of the rice huller, such as running grain and incomplete winnowing, installed an elbow at the outlet of the rice huller, which reduced the grain content in the rice husk by half compared to the past.

△ In the past, the State-owned Changchun Rice Mill in Changchun had uneven sizes of millet grains. Large grains were crushed, and small grains were not ground, resulting in a low rice yield. Based on this situation, the factory held a technical research meeting and decided to implement separate processing of grains based on size. The workers improved some equipment, changing the original four screens to two-layer screen bottoms. The first layer screens out large grains, and the second layer screens out small grains containing impurities, and grain storage bins were installed so that the selected small grains flow directly into the storage bins. In this way, large and small grains are processed separately, and the rice yield is greatly improved. In the past, the rice yield of second-class millet was 77.82%. After changing to separate processing, the rice yield increased to 78.76%.

    工业生产方面节约粮食的一些方法
    △中国畜产公司江苏省徐州支公司试用白矾、苏打等化学药品代替粮食制裘，不仅产品的质量和规格符合要求，而且皮板柔软、坚韧耐用，在摄氏六十度高热下也不致变质。按照历来相传的制裘方法，每张绵羊皮加工成裘，平均需用粮食一斤左右，每次操作过程要七天到十天。改用化学药品既节约了粮食，又简化了操作过程，每次只要三天就行了，因此加工成本也比过去降低了百分之八以上。这一方法普遍采用后，这个公司按今年计划加工的绵羊皮和狗皮等计算，约可节省一万多斤粮食。
    △制造葡萄糖一般都是用玉米或湿粉。今年五月，中国化工原料公司上海采购供应站接受群众的建议，从淘米水的沉淀物里试制出成分百分之七十的固体葡萄糖。这个公司随即商请两个单位的伙食团把每天淘米的头道水用缸积盛起来，放一些明矾让它沉淀，把沉淀物交给金城化学工业社制造葡萄糖。利用淘米水沉淀物制成的第一批葡萄糖，经过化验，成分和规格同用玉米制成的一样。制造厂的生产设备和操作规程也不需要改变。所有生产葡萄糖的厂家，都能采用这种原料。
    △广东粤东区酿酒工人利用当地制造红糖时过滤出来的渣滓酿造糖泡酒，每百斤渣滓能酿成四十度的糖泡酒十四斤到十八斤。糖泡酒可以制成五加皮酒和青梅酒。浙江金华地区利用糖沫酿酒，去年一年节约粮食三十二万斤。
    △国营济南酒精总厂用黑霉菌代替黄霉菌制曲发酵，使淀粉出酒率提高。用黑霉菌制的曲耐热性和耐酸性很强。在发酵糖化过程中，同样的原料，黑霉菌曲生成的糖比黄霉菌曲多百分之十五，每百斤原料比黄霉菌多出一点一六斤酒精。根据这个厂今年下半年的生产任务计算，下半年可以节省一百零四万斤粮食。
    △上海市郊区供销合作社第二蔬菜加工场试用番茄代替大米制醋成功，成本低，质量好，为国家节约了大批粮食。
    △江苏无锡市土产公司利用制粉丝剩下的绿豆浆水代替面筋，制造白酱油和味精，可以节约大量制面筋的面粉。
    △北京市的四百多家公、私营酱油酿造厂在生产酱油过程中绝大部分都已经取消了酱色。如果以过去全市每月生产四百万斤酱油、每百斤酱油掺用二斤酱色计算，现在每个月就节省八万斤酱色；如果制造这些酱色就要浪费掉十六万斤粮食（做一斤酱色需用二斤粮食）。酱油里取消酱色以后并不影响质量。（因为酱色本身并不能增加酱油的鲜味和香气，也没有什么营养价值；而且过去常常因为酱色掺得过多反而使酱油发涩、发苦，私商还可利用酱色掺假欺骗顾客。）北京市生产的不加酱色的酱油销路很好，普遍受到用户的欢迎。
    △山东济南八家面粉厂，今年第一季度从六十九万多斤“下脚物”中，整理出能磨制面粉的小麦十四万五千多斤，豌豆两万七千多斤。
    △上海国营上海面粉厂化验时发现麦皮中还带有面粉，技术人员和工人共同研究，在麦皮出路过程中增添一部磨子和一个圆筛子，从每百斤麦皮里，可多筛出六两多面粉。
    △上海国营第四米厂针对砻糠跑谷、风筛不净的缺点，在砻谷机的出口处装置一个弯头，使砻糠含谷量比过去减少了一半。
    △长春国营长春制米厂过去由于谷（粟）粒大小不匀，大粒谷子磨碎了，小粒的还磨不着，出米率不高。厂里根据这个情况召开技术研究会，决定实行分粒加工，工人们改进了部分设备，把原来的四个筛子改成两层筛底，第一层筛出大粒谷子，第二层筛出小粒谷子的含杂物，又安设了储粮箱，使选出来的小粒谷子直接流到储粮箱内。这样大粒的和小粒的分别加工，出米率提高了很多。过去二等谷子出米率是百分之七十七点八二，改为分粒加工后，出米率提高到百分之七十八点七六。
