Polish young people send greetings to friends from all countries

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 8th: In Warsaw, anyone coming from all over the world to participate in the festival will not feel lonely or strange. Wherever they go, radiant Polish young people greet them and help them with all their affairs. One day, a West German youth named Grau met a Polish girl in a park by the roadside who greeted him. Before he could answer, he was rushed away by a row of marching singing troops. Unable to find this enthusiastic friend, he wrote a letter to the editor of an evening newspaper, requesting that his letter to this unknown friend be published. In this letter, he said: "I have gained precious friendship in your capital dedicated to peace. Germans have committed crimes in your country in the past... Today, some Germans have not yet learned from the war. But believe me, my unknown friend: We German youth will not allow rearmament and the revival of Hitlerism. ... Friendship knows no borders, and we want to be friends with Poland and the people of all countries forever."

    波兰年轻人向各国友人致意问好
    据新华社华沙八日讯　在华沙，从全世界来参加联欢节的任何人都不会感到孤独和生疏。他们无论走到哪里，都有容光焕发的波兰年轻人向他们致意问好，并且帮助他们办理一切事务。有一天，西德青年格劳在路旁公园中碰到一个波兰女孩子向他问好。他还没有来得及回答，就被一排并肩歌唱前进的队伍冲开了。他没有法子找到这个热情的朋友，就写了一封信送到一家晚报的编辑部，请求把他给这个不知名的朋友的信发表出来。他在这封信里说：“我在你们这个献身于和平的首都得到了珍贵的友情。德国人从前在你们的国家里犯过罪……今天，有些德国人也还没有从战争中得到教训。但是，请相信我，我的不知名的朋友：我们德国青年是不允许重新武装和复活希特勒主义的。……友谊是不分国度的，我们要同波兰和各国人民永远友好相处。”
