Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch from New York: The "Worker's Daily" reports that the U.S. Communist Party held a two-day national conference in early August, attended by 76 representatives from 27 states.

    Communist Party leader Leffert delivered a report to the conference. In his report, he pointed out that the primary goal of the current domestic struggle is to take advantage of the favorable international situation to abolish the McCarran Internal Security Act of 1950 and the Communist Control Act of 1954, and to strive for the reversal of the persecution of Communist Party leaders. Leffert said: In order to realize the resolutions of the Geneva Conference, it is now necessary to launch a national crusade, not only demanding a complete end to the Cold War, but also demanding an end to the violation of civil rights within the United States. Leffert said: This means ending the Smith Act trials, ending the Nazi-like persecution of labor leaders, no longer generally refusing to issue passports, especially no longer refusing to issue Paul Robeson's passport, and no longer conducting congressional hearings and expelling teachers and government employees.

    The conference adopted Leffert's report and called on Communist Party members and all democratically-minded Americans to launch a struggle to implement a bill of rights that guarantees civil rights.

    美国共产党全国会议通过莱弗特的报告
    号召党员和美国人民为保障公民权利而斗争
    新华社十九日讯　纽约消息：“工人日报”报道，美国共产党在八月上旬举行了一次为期两天的全国会议，出席会议的有来自二十七个州的代表七十六人。
    共产党领导人莱弗特向会议作了报告。他在报告中指出，当前国内斗争的首要目标是根据有利的国际局势，争取废除一九五○年的麦卡伦国内安全法和一九五四年的共产党管制法，争取撤销对共产党领袖的迫害。莱弗特说：为了实现日内瓦会议的决议，现在需要发动一个全国十字军运动，不仅要求整个地结束冷战，而且要求结束美国国内对公民权利的侵犯。莱弗特说：这就是说要结束史密斯法的审讯，结束对劳工领袖的纳粹般的迫害，不再一般地拒绝发给出国护照、特别是不再拒绝发给保罗·罗伯逊的出国护照，不再进行国会传讯和开除教员及政府雇员。
    会议通过了莱弗特的报告，并且号召共产党员和一切具有民主思想的美国人为争取实施保障公民权利的权利法而展开斗争。
