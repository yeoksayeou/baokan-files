Xinhua News Agency, August 14th: According to TASS, the Soviet government's decision to reduce its armed forces by 640,000 personnel before December 15, 1955, has attracted widespread attention in Western countries.

    Reuters of Great Britain transmitted the full text of TASS's news about the Soviet government's decision. The news agency's Moscow correspondent, commenting on the news, pointed out that Western observers "believe that the Russians are sincere" and that the purpose of the decision is to further ease international tensions and build trust between countries.

    The news reached London late, and newspapers with later publication deadlines published the news with large headlines. "The Daily Mirror" emphasized that this pleasant news is another friendly gesture from the East since the Geneva Conference.

    The newspapers attached importance to the passage about the Soviet government's decision to reduce the size of its armed forces being based on the desire to further ease international tensions and build trust between countries. In this regard, most newspapers drew readers' attention to the steps previously taken by the Soviet government in this area, especially the Soviet government's proposal of May 10 to the Subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission.

    According to a United Press International report from Washington, most U.S. officials believe that the news of the Soviet troop reduction is "hopeful news" and a "good sign for international disarmament." However, these people also said not to "overestimate" the news about this measure.

    Several Parisian newspapers published brief news about the Soviet government's decision without comment. "L'Humanité" published the TASS communiqué on the front page with large headlines.

    Newspapers in Canada, Austria, and Sweden all published this news in prominent positions.

    苏联关于裁军的决定引起西方国家重视
    新华社十四日讯  据塔斯社消息：苏联政府关于在一九五五年十二月十五日以前裁减武装部队六十四万人的决定，在西方国家引起普遍的重视。
    英国路透社全文转发了塔斯社关于苏联政府这一决定的消息。这家通讯社驻莫斯科记者在评论这一消息时指出，西方观察家们“认为俄国人是诚心诚意的”，并且说，这个决定的目的是进一步缓和国际紧张局势和建立国与国之间的信任。
    伦敦收到消息的时间已经很晚，出刊较迟的报纸以大字标题刊载了这条消息。“每日镜报”强调指出，这一令人愉快的消息是日内瓦会议以来东方的又一友好的姿态。
    各报重视关于苏联政府决定裁减武装部队数量是基于进一步缓和国际紧张局势和建立国与国之间的信任的愿望这一段话。在这方面，大多数报纸提起读者注意苏联政府过去在这方面所采取的步骤，特别是苏联政府五月十日在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会上的建议。
    据合众社驻华盛顿记者报道，大部分美国官方人士认为苏联裁减武装部队人数的消息是“使人产生希望的消息”，并且是“国际裁军的好征兆”。但是这些人同时又说，不要对关于这个措施的消息“估计过高”。
    几家巴黎报纸刊载了关于苏联政府这一决定的简短消息，未加评论。“人道报”在首页以大字标题刊载了塔斯社的公报。
    加拿大、奥地利、瑞典的报纸都以显著地位刊载了这个消息。
