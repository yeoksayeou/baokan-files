Xinhua News Agency, Hiroshima, July 7th: The World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs continued in Hiroshima today. Today, group meetings were held in six different venues. The meetings mainly discussed issues such as strengthening the signature campaign to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, and the disasters caused by atomic weapons.

In addition to representatives from various regions and the people of Hiroshima, participants in today's group meetings included victims and surviving family members of American atomic weapons from Nagasaki (the first city to be bombed by an American atomic bomb ten years ago) and Yaizu (the hometown of the Japanese fishermen who were injured by an American hydrogen bomb explosion last year). At the morning meeting, they recounted their personal tragic experiences and denounced the disasters caused by atomic weapons. Some of them had lost their loved ones to American atomic weapons, and some of them were maimed by American atomic weapons. Their accusations aroused people's hatred for the barbaric acts of using atomic weapons for slaughter. Representatives from various countries who participated in the group meetings expressed their determination to appeal to the people of their respective countries to ban atomic weapons after returning home.

At the afternoon group meeting, fifty representatives from labor unions, women's groups, religious groups, student groups, and other organizations from various parts of Japan reported on the activities of their respective groups in promoting the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs.

In conjunction with the convening of the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, Hiroshima is holding a series of peace-related events these days, including a peace art exhibition, an atomic bomb materials exhibition, a world children's painting exhibition, and peace lectures. This city, which was first devastated by an American atomic bomb ten years ago, is now working to promote the world's people's movement against atomic warfare.

    禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会
    举行分组会议
    新华社七日讯　广岛消息：禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会七日继续在广岛举行。今天举行的是分别在六个会场的分组会议。会议主要讨论了加强推进禁止原子弹和氢弹签名运动、原子武器的灾害等问题。
    今天参加分组会的人，除了各地代表和广岛人民以外，还有来自长崎（十年前第一个遭受美国原子弹轰炸的城市）、烧津（去年遭受美国氢弹爆炸伤害的日本渔民的故乡）的美国原子武器的受害者和遗属。他们在上午的会议上，以亲身的悲惨遭遇，控诉了原子武器所造成的灾难。他们有的人被美国原子武器夺去了亲人，有的人自己被美国原子武器炸成残废。他们的控诉激起人们对使用原子武器进行野蛮屠杀的行为的痛恨。参加了分组会的各国代表，纷纷表示保证在回国以后要向本国人民呼吁禁止原子武器。
    在下午的分组会议上，由日本各地的工会、妇女、宗教、学生等团体的代表五十人，报告了各团体进行禁止原子弹和氢弹运动的情况。
    这两天，广岛市配合着禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会的召开正在举行一系列的有关和平的节目，其中包括和平美术展览会、原子弹资料展览会、世界儿童绘画展览会、和平问题讲座等等。这个十年前首先遭到美国原子弹破坏的城市，今天正在为推进世界人民反对原子战争的运动而努力。
