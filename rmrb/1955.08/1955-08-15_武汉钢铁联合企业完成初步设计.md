    The Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex, a central China iron and steel base to be built during the First Five-Year Plan, has completed its preliminary design after more than three years of preparation, during which abundant resources were identified and a factory site was selected. Currently, preparations are underway for the technical design and the construction of various auxiliary enterprises and dormitories.

    In the factory area of this iron and steel complex, one can see many engineering geologists, drillers, and surveyors from all over the country, who are working intensely on surveying and collecting data for the upcoming technical design. A thermal power plant serving this project has already begun construction. Two newly established weather stations dedicated to this construction project have also started operating.

    According to the national plan, this iron and steel complex will be a complete iron and steel enterprise with various iron and steel smelting departments, as well as mining and ore dressing departments, with a massive production scale. It will be constructed by fully utilizing the latest Soviet technological achievements, and its quota standards, technical specifications, and production equipment will all reach the world's first-class level.

    The preparatory work for the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex officially began in March 1952. For more than three years, the Chinese government has transferred many cadres and technicians from all over the country to prepare for the construction of this new iron and steel base, organizing a strong construction team. Some of these assembled personnel are currently responsible for the current preparatory work, while others are studying in the Soviet Union and Anshan, China. After the preparatory work for this iron and steel complex began, large-scale exploration work was immediately carried out in the Daye Tieshan mining area. At the same time, economic surveys and geological surveys were conducted to select the factory site, and a large amount of data was extensively collected.

    In the preparatory work for the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex, the Soviet government sent a large number of experts to provide assistance. In the spring of 1954, the design experts group from the Soviet Black Metallurgy Design Institute, which helped with the design, surveyed more than twenty factory sites, and finally, after careful research, selected the most ideal one. When exploring the Daye Tieshan mining area, Soviet geological experts repeatedly braved the summer heat and severe cold, climbed peaks, and guided the geological exploration personnel there to carry out their work.

    武汉钢铁联合企业完成初步设计
    将在第一个五年计划中兴建的华中钢铁基地——武汉钢铁联合企业，经过三年多的准备，已经掌握了丰富的资源，选定了厂址，并在最近完成了初步设计。目前，正在为技术设计和各种附属企业、宿舍的施工作准备。
    在这个钢铁联合企业的厂区里，人们可以看到许多来自全国各地的工程地质人员、钻探工人和测量人员，他们正在紧张地进行勘测工作，为就要开始的技术设计搜集资料。一座为这个工程服务的热电站已经着手兴建。两个新设的专为这个建设工程服务的气象台，也已开始工作。
    按照国家计划规定，这个钢铁联合企业将是一个拥有各种钢铁冶炼部门和采矿、选矿等部门的完整的钢铁联合企业，生产规模是巨大的。它将充分利用苏联最新的技术成就来进行建设，它的定额标准、技术规范和生产设备，都将达到世界第一流的水平。
    武汉钢铁联合企业的筹建工作是从一九五二年三月正式开始的。三年多来，我国政府为了筹备建设这一新的钢铁基地，曾经从全国各地调集了许多干部和技术人员，组织了一支强大的建设队伍。这些集结起来的人员，现在有的正担当着目前的准备工作，有的在苏联和我国鞍山等地学习。这个钢铁联合企业筹建工作开始后，曾立即对大冶铁山矿区进行了大规模的勘探工作。同时，为了选择厂址，还进行了经济调查和地质勘测工作，广泛地搜集了大量的资料。
    在武汉钢铁联合企业的筹建工作中，苏联政府派来大批专家给予帮助。一九五四年春天，帮助设计的苏联黑色冶金设计院的设计专家组曾踏勘了二十多个厂址，最后经过缜密研究，选定了最理想的一个。在勘探大冶铁山矿区时，苏联地质专家们多次冒着暑热和严寒，攀登高峰，指导在那里的地质勘探人员进行工作。（新华社）
