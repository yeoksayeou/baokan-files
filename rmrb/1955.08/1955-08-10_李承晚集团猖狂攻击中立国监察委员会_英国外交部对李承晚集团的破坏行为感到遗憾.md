Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 8th: The Syngman Rhee clique's premeditated plan to sabotage the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is being carried out frantically under the protection of the United States.

According to a Reuters report from Seoul on the 7th, the South Korean Foreign Ministry officially confirmed that the Syngman Rhee clique has issued an "ultimatum" to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, demanding that the commission withdraw from South Korea before August 13th. The South Korean "Haptong News Agency" previously revealed that the Syngman Rhee government threatened in the "ultimatum" issued on August 6th: "If they do not withdraw on schedule, we will not be responsible for the consequences."

At the same time, the Syngman Rhee clique has mobilized its plainclothes agents and the lackeys of reactionary groups to hold "demonstrations" and "rallying conferences" in Daegu, Busan, Gunsan, Seoul, Incheon, and other places in recent days, clamoring to "drive out" the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from South Korea.

Since Syngman Rhee clamored on August 1st to "recover" the areas south of the 38th parallel controlled by the Korean-Chinese side and to "drive away" the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the commander of the U.S. Far East Command and "United Nations" Commander-in-Chief, Lemnitzer, and the commander of the U.S. Far East Army and Eighth Army commander, White, rushed from Tokyo to Seoul on the 4th for secret talks with Syngman Rhee. U.S. propaganda agencies spread the word in advance that Lemnitzer and White's trip to Seoul was to "soothe" Syngman Rhee. However, the day after Lemnitzer and White returned to Tokyo from Seoul on the 6th, South Korean Acting Foreign Minister Cho Chung-hwan publicly announced at a press conference that Lemnitzer and Syngman Rhee had agreed "in principle" during their talks that Korea "no longer needs" the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission; they also agreed "in principle" that the area south of the 38th parallel controlled by the Korean-Chinese side is "very important for the defense of Seoul."

It is worth noting that a dispatch from Washington by the International News Service on the 5th revealed that the U.S. and Rhee sides had reached an agreement on a new military aid plan after weeks of negotiations in Washington. Disregarding the prohibition of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the United States has agreed to supply South Korea with jet fighters, heavy ground weapons, and supplies for ten reserve divisions.

Xinhua News Agency, August 9th: The Syngman Rhee clique's organized attacks on the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission at various ports in South Korea have become increasingly rampant.

Since August 7th, a large number of thugs from the Syngman Rhee clique have surrounded Wolmido Island, where the Incheon Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission inspection team is located. They not only blockaded the causeway leading to the inspection team's camp on the island but also openly used motorboats to encircle the area on the sea. They have launched attacks for days, throwing stones and attempting to break into the island.

In Busan, groups of thugs held demonstrations on the 7th and 8th. They frantically attacked the Xia Li camp where the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission personnel were stationed and attempted to cut off the water supply line to the camp.

Among the demonstrators in Gunsan, some were found to be carrying hand grenades. According to the police, the person said he wanted to kill the Polish and Czechoslovak personnel of the inspection team.

Demonstrations against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission have also taken place in Daegu and Gangneung, where Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission inspection teams are stationed.

A message from Washington by the U.S. International News Service on August 8th shows that the Syngman Rhee clique's unbridled atrocities are supported by the United States. The message said: "Washington has not made any effort to restrain the South Korean government from suppressing the agitated feelings demanding the dissolution of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. ... As far as Washington is concerned, it would be very happy if the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission were dissolved and returned home separately. This attitude is exactly the attitude taken by the South Korean government." The International News Service pointed out: Therefore, the United States is "in a sense" "happy" about South Korea's "agitated feelings" against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The message also revealed that "Washington is constantly trying to get the Swiss and Swedish governments to withdraw from the committee."

Xinhua News Agency, August 9th: London dispatch: A British Foreign Office spokesman said on August 8th, "We regret the threats made by the South Korean government to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the demonstrations against them." He said, "We attach great importance to the observance of the armistice agreement."

The British Foreign Office believes that the United Nations Command Headquarters is "certainly responsible for protecting this committee (referring to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission)." The Foreign Office spokesman also pointed out that this time South Korea's opposition to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's exercise of its functions "has a more serious meaning."

    李承晚集团猖狂攻击中立国监察委员会
    英国外交部对李承晚集团的破坏行为感到遗憾
    新华社平壤八日电　李承晚集团处心积虑破坏朝鲜中立国监察委员会的计划正在美国的庇护下疯狂地进行中。
    据路透社七日自汉城报道，南朝鲜外务部正式证实，李承晚集团已经向中立国监察委员会提出一项“最后通牒”，要求委员会在八月十三日以前撤离南朝鲜。南朝鲜合同通讯社在此以前透露，李承晚政府在八月六日发出的“最后通牒”中威胁说：“如不按期撤走，对其后果概不负责”。
    同时，李承晚集团动员它的便衣特务和反动团体的喽罗们连日在大邱、釜山、群山、汉城、仁川等地举行“示威”和“奋起大会”，叫嚣要把中立国监察委员会“赶出”南朝鲜。
    自从李承晚在八月一日叫嚣要“收复”三八线以南的朝中方面控制地区和“赶走”中立国监察委员会以后，美国远东军总司令、“联合国”军总司令兰尼兹尔和美国远东陆军司令兼第八军军长怀特曾在四日从东京赶到汉城，和李承晚举行秘密会谈。美国宣传机关事前散布空气说，兰尼兹尔和怀特的汉城之行是要使李承晚“和缓”下来。但是，就在兰尼兹尔和怀特在六日从汉城返回东京的第二天，南朝鲜代理外务部长官曹正焕就在记者招待会上公开宣布，兰尼兹尔和李承晚在会谈中已经在“原则上”同意，朝鲜已经“用不着”中立国监察委员会了；他们还在“原则上”同意，朝中方面控制下的三八线以南地区“对保卫汉城是非常重要的”。
    值得注意的是，国际新闻社五日从华盛顿发出的消息透露，美李双方在华盛顿经过几个星期的谈判后，已经就新的军事援助计划达成了协议。美国不顾朝鲜停战协定的禁止，已经同意供给南朝鲜喷气式飞机、重型地面武器和十个后备师的供应。
    新华社九日讯　李承晚集团在南朝鲜各口岸组织的攻击中立国监察委员会的暴行越发猖狂了。
    八月七日以来，李承晚集团的大批的暴徒包围了仁川中立国监察委员会视察小组所在的月尾岛。他们不但封锁着通往岛上视察小组营地的堤道，并且公然用机帆船在海面进行包围。他们连日都发动进攻，投掷石块，企图冲入岛内。
    在釜山，成群结队的暴徒七日和八日接连举行示威。他们疯狂地进攻中立国视察小组人员驻地夏里营，并且企图切断通到那里的水的供应线段。
    在群山的示威者中发现有人竟携带有手榴弹。据警察说，这个人说他想炸死视察小组的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克人员。
    在驻有中立国监察委员会视察小组的大邱和江陵也都发生了反对中立国监察委员会的示威游行。
    从美国的国际新闻社八月八日从华盛顿发出的一则消息可以看出李承晚集团这种肆无忌惮的暴行是得到美国方面支持的，这则消息说：“华盛顿并没有作出任何努力使南朝鲜政府制止要求解散中立国监察委员会的激动情绪。……就华盛顿来说，如果中立国监察委员会解散并分头回国，那将是非常高兴的事。这种态度也恰恰是南朝鲜政府采取的态度。”国际新闻社指出：因此，美国在“某种意义”上对于南朝鲜反对中立国监察委员会的“激动情绪”“感到高兴”。这则消息还透露，“华盛顿不时地在设法使瑞士和瑞典政府脱离委员会”。
    新华社九日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交部发言人八日说，“我们对南朝鲜政府向中立国监察委员会发出的威胁以及对它们进行的示威，感到遗憾。”他说，“我们十分重视对停战协定的遵守”。
    英国外交部认为联合国军总司令部是“肯定的有责任保护这个委员会（按指中立国监察委员会）的”。外交部发言人并且指出，南朝鲜这一次反对中立国监察委员会行使职权，“具有更严重的意义”。
