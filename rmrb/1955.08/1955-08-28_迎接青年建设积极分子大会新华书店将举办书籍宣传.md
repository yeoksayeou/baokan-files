    To greet the National Conference of Active Young Builders, the Xinhua Bookstore Main Store has decided to hold book promotion weeks in 145 large and medium-sized cities nationwide.
    The book promotion week will run from September 20th to the 26th. During this period, Xinhua Bookstores in various cities will widely introduce a batch of excellent works suitable for young people to read to young readers. Each store will set up special counters for these types of books.
    Currently, the Xinhua Bookstore Main Store has compiled a recommended book list of relevant books. The recommended book list is divided into three categories: literature and art, news reports, comic strips, and propaganda posters, totaling 127 kinds. Most of these books and paintings introduce young heroes and model workers and advanced young people who have emerged from various fronts in China's socialist construction. This recommended book list will be printed into exquisite color leaflets and distributed in Xinhua Bookstore stores.
    The Xinhua Bookstore Main Store has issued a notice instructing sales stores at all levels to actively prepare and conscientiously do a good job in the related book promotion week work before, during, and after the conference. (Xinhua News Agency)

    迎接青年建设积极分子大会新华书店将举办书籍宣传
    新华书店总店决定在全国一百四十五个大中城市举办书籍宣传周，以迎接全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。
    书籍宣传周是从九月二十日起到二十六日止。在这一期间，各城市的新华书店将广泛地向青年读者介绍一批适合青年阅读的优秀著作。各门市部将设置这类书籍的专柜。
    目前，新华书店总店已就有关书籍编选了一个推荐书目。推荐书目分文艺、通讯报告、连环画和宣传画三类，共一百二十七种；这些书画，绝大部分是介绍在我国社会主义建设事业中从各个战线上涌现出来的青年英雄模范和青年先进人物。这个推荐书目将印制成精致的彩色摺页，在新华书店各门市部分发。
    新华书店总店已发出通知，指示各级销货店积极进行准备，认真地在大会前后及大会期间做好有关书籍宣传周的工作。（新华社）
