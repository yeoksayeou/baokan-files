The Party branch committee of the factory where Song Guoming worked did not adhere to the principles of the Party and fight against Song Guoming's erroneous behavior. The Fengtai District Committee of the Communist Party of China has also instructed them to conduct thorough self-criticism in order to learn from the experience.
