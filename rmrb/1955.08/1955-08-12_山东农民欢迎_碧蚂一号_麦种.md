    Shandong Farmers Welcome "Bima No. 1" Wheat Variety

    The "Bima No. 1" and "Bima No. 4" superior wheat varieties planted in some areas of Shandong Province have generally yielded bumper harvests. In areas such as Linyi, Heze, Laiyang, Tai'an, and Dezhou, the yield is generally more than 20% higher than that of local wheat varieties, and about 15% higher than that of previously promoted varieties such as "Xuzhou 438." The thirteen mu of "Bima No. 4" planted by the Dongfanghong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Heze County yielded an average of 450 jin per mu, with three mu reaching a high yield of 620 jin per mu on average. Farmers in various places unanimously reported that "Bima No. 1" and "Bima No. 4" have high and stable yields, are resistant to disease, and have low grain shattering. They have requested to expand the planting area during this year's autumn planting. In order to meet the urgent needs of the masses, six special districts, including Heze, Jiaozhou, Tai'an, and Wendeng, and Zibo City plan to purchase more than 600,000 jin of "Bima No. 1" and "Bima No. 4" wheat for allocation and promotion. In addition to the more than 150,000 jin reserved within the province, the Provincial Department of Agriculture will also purchase 200,000 jin of "Bima No. 1" from Shaanxi Province and concentrate on breeding and promotion in the Linyi Special District.

    山东农民欢迎“碧蚂一号”麦种
    山东省部分地区种植的“碧蚂一号”和“碧蚂四号”优良品种小麦，普遍丰收。临沂、菏泽、莱阳、泰安、德州等地区一般都比当地品种小麦增产二成以上，比以往推广的“徐州四三八”等品种小麦也多收一成五左右。菏泽县东方红农业生产合作社种植的十三亩“碧蚂四号”，平均每亩产四百五十斤，其中有三亩每亩平均达六百二十斤的高额产量。各地农民一致反映“碧蚂一号”和“碧蚂四号”的产量高而稳定、性耐疸、少落粒。纷纷要求在今年秋种时扩大种植面积。为了满足群众的迫切要求，菏泽、胶州、泰安、文登等六个专区及淄博市计划收购“碧蚂一号”和“碧蚂四号”小麦六十多万斤，以供调剂推广。省农业厅除在省内储备了十五万多斤外，并向陕西省收购“碧蚂一号”二十万斤，在临沂专区集中繁殖推广。（朱京生、张邦屏）
