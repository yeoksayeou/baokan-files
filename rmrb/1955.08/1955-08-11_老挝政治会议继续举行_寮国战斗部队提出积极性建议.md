Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 10th: Lao news: The Lao political conference continued on August 1st, 3rd, and 5th after the meeting held on July 25th.

On the 1st, the Royal Government delegation again proposed solutions to the problem of Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces, insisting on resolving the issue of these two provinces first, before discussing the general election issue. The Lao Fighting Units delegation stated that it could not agree.

At the meeting on the 3rd, the Lao Fighting Units delegation pointed out that the issue of political power in the two provinces and the issue of general elections could not be discussed separately. Based on this premise, the Lao Fighting Units put forward the following positive suggestions: the Lao Fighting Units, in principle, acknowledge the supreme authority of the Royal Government and agree to place the political power of Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces under the supreme authority of the Royal Government. To realize this principle, it is suggested that the Royal Government recognize and receive the entirety of the political power of these two provinces, and entrust the administration of the political power of these two provinces to the Lao Fighting Units.

The Lao Fighting Units delegation explained at the meeting that in these two provinces, which were designated as Lao units' assembly areas by the Geneva Accords, the Lao units had long established administrative organs, armies, and grassroots organizations of political power, and were able to guarantee the people a safe life. However, the Royal Government, losing its composure, said that this suggestion "meant opposition to the Royal Government," and therefore refused to accept this positive suggestion from the Lao Fighting Units.

At the meeting on the 5th, the Royal Government delegation responded to the suggestions made by the Lao Fighting Units delegation at the meetings on July 20th and 25th regarding the issue of general elections. The Royal Government openly stated that there could only be a general election jointly supervised by both sides when the issue of political power in the two provinces was resolved. The Royal Government also stated that it was not prepared to make any modifications to the regulations for the general election. In this way, the Royal Government effectively rejected all the suggestions put forward by the Lao Fighting Units regarding the general election.

The Lao Fighting Units representative pointed out that the Royal Government's statement overturned its own promise made at the meeting on July 25th. At that meeting, the Royal Government believed that the revision of the election regulations would be submitted to the Lao National Assembly for resolution, and had said that issues such as the participation of the International Commission and representatives of various parties in supervising the election organization could be resolved. The Lao Fighting Units representative said that this inconsistent attitude showed that the Royal Government was insincerely engaging in deceptive tactics. However, the Lao Fighting Units still suggested that the Royal Government could carefully consider these issues again based on the wishes of the people, rather than based on the wishes of a minority in the Royal Government, and suggested that the meeting continue on August 8th.

### 老挝政治会议继续举行  寮国战斗部队提出积极性建议

    老挝政治会议继续举行
    寮国战斗部队提出积极性建议
    新华社河内十日电　老挝消息：老挝政治会议在七月二十五日举行会议以后，在八月一日、三日、五日继续进行。
    一日会议上，王国政府代表团又提出解决丰沙里、桑怒两省问题的提案，并且坚持先解决两省问题，然后再讨论普选问题。寮国战斗部队代表团表示不能同意。
    在三日会议上，寮国战斗部队代表团指出，两省的政权问题和普选问题不能分割开来谈。在这个前提下，寮国战斗部队方面提出了下列积极的建议：寮国战斗部队在原则上承认王国政府的最高权力和同意丰沙里、桑怒两省的政权置于王国政府的最高权力之下。为实现这个原则，建议王国政府承认和接收这二省的政权的整体，并且委托寮国战斗部队管理这两省的政权。
    寮国战斗部队代表团在会上说明，在日内瓦协定规定为寮国部队集结区的这两省，寮国部队早就设有行政机构、军队和政权的基层组织，并且能够保证人民过安全的生活。但是，王国政府方面不冷静地说，这个建议“意味着反对王国政府”，因此拒绝接受寮国战斗部队的这个积极性的建议。
    在五日会议上，王国政府代表团就寮国战斗部队代表团在七月二十日、二十五日会议上提出的关于普选问题的建议作了答复。王国政府方面公然说，什么时候解决两省的政权问题，什么时候才能有由双方共同参加监督的普选。王国政府方面也表示不准备对普选的条例加以修改。这样，王国政府就在事实上拒绝了寮国战斗部队所提出的关于普选的全部建议。
    寮国战斗部队代表指出，王国政府方面的发言推翻了它自己在七月二十五日会议上的诺言。在那次会议上，王国政府方面认为选举条例的修改将提交老挝国民议会来解决，并且曾说国际委员会以及各党派代表参加监督选举的组织等问题有可能解决。寮国战斗部队代表说，这种出尔反尔的态度说明王国政府毫无诚意地在玩弄欺骗手段。但是，寮国战斗部队仍旧建议王国政府能根据人民的愿望，而不是根据王国政府里少数人的愿望，再次慎重考虑这些问题，并且建议在八月八日继续开会。
