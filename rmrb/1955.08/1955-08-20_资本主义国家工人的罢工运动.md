Strike Movements of Workers in Capitalist Countries

    **3.4 Million British Workers Demand Wage Increases**

    Currently, nearly 3.4 million workers in Britain have put forward demands for wage increases.

    The Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, uniting approximately three million workers in major mechanical industries in Britain, held a meeting in Blackpool on the 10th, where a resolution was unanimously adopted demanding higher wages.

    On the same day, the leading body of the National Union of Railwaymen, with 370,000 members, decided to demand wage increases. It has instructed the union's negotiating committee to "urgently consider" the demands for wage increases and to seek agreement with the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen and other railway workers' unions to act in unison.

    Four thousand seven hundred barge and tugboat workers in London also put forward a demand on the 8th for a daily wage increase of ten shillings and sixpence.

    **West German Workers Launch Struggle to Increase Wages**

    The scale of the movement for wage increases among West German workers is expanding, and now about three million workers and employees are involved in this movement.

    The West German Civil Servants' Union has announced the termination of wage agreements effective for approximately 800,000 workers and employees throughout West Germany. Other large unions announcing the termination of wage agreements include the Metalworkers' Union of Württemberg-Baden (representing 400,000 workers), the West German Railway Workers' Union (representing approximately 270,000 railway workers throughout West Germany), the Chemical Workers' Union (representing approximately 34,000 employees in Württemberg-Baden), and the Bank and Insurance Company Union (representing 18,000 members in Hesse). Smaller unions such as the Catering Workers' Union, the Paper Workers' Union, and the Textile Workers' Union have also terminated their wage agreements in several states or throughout West Germany.

    The upsurge in the West German workers' movement for wage increases is due to the continuous rise in the cost of living in West Germany over the past year.

    **Nantes Port Workers in France Fight for Higher Wages**

    Nantes Port Dispatch: Workers in Nantes Port, France, who are fighting for wage increases, held a demonstration of several thousand people on the afternoon of the 18th. The French authorities dispatched the "Republican Guard" to attack the workers with batons and tear gas, seriously injuring dozens of people.

    According to newspaper reports, workers at the Brittany and Loire shipbuilding factories, the Southwest National Aircraft Manufacturing Company enterprises, steel factories, and other factories in Nantes Port, under the leadership of various unions affiliated with the General Confederation of Labor (CGT), the French Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC), and the Workers' Force (FO), have put forward a demand for a wage increase of 40 francs per hour. They held a rally of more than 5,000 people on the 17th for this matter and sent representatives to negotiate with the capitalists. The capitalists promised to meet the workers' demands during the negotiations, but later refused to fulfill their promises and decided to close these enterprises. The workers' large demonstration on the 18th was to express their protest.

    **Strike Movements in Chile and Uruguay Increasingly High**

    The Soviet "Labor News" published an article by Tikhonov and Shulyudin on July 30, commenting on the strike situation in Chile and Uruguay in mid-July. The article discussed that the main reason for the strikes was the sharp deterioration of the people's lives caused by the control of American monopoly capitalists and the anti-national policies of certain groups connected with American monopoly capitalists. The authors wrote: The first half of July was characterized by an unprecedented scale of strike struggles by the Chilean working people.

    At the call of the United Workers' Confederation of Chile, which unites 44 trade union federations, 1.2 million employees in industry, transportation, and government agencies stopped working in early July. The strike almost completely paralyzed various activities in Chile. The life of various factories, railways and organs was also stagnant.

    The authors pointed out: In order to support the railway, postal and telecommunications, and bus workers who first started the strike, a general strike was announced nationwide. In terms of strength and scale, this strike was the largest strike in the history of the Chilean working class. It simply swept the whole country. The participants in the strike accounted for more than one-fifth of the entire population of Chile. The strike demonstrated the strength of the working class and its determination to protect its rights. The strike also showed the unity and organizational strength of the working people. It was precisely for this reason that the Chilean government not long ago had to agree to the demands of the transport workers and postal and telecommunications workers for at least a 60 percent increase in wages and the formulation of new conditions for paying pensions.

    The authors continued, echoing the fighting offensive of the Chilean workers was the strike struggle of the working people of Uruguay. The proletariat of the capital of Uruguay held one of the largest strikes in Montevideo in several years on July 22. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

### 资本主义国家工人的罢工运动

    资本主义国家工人的罢工运动
    英国三百四十万工人要求增加工资
    目前，英国有近三百四十万工人提出了增加工资的要求。
    团结了英国主要机械工业部门中约三百万工人的造船工人及机械工业工人工会联合会十日在布拉克浦举行了会议，会上一致通过决议，要求提高工资。
    同日，拥有三十七万会员的全国铁路工人工会的领导机构决定要求增加工资。它已经责成这个工会的谈判委员会“赶紧考虑”关于增加工资的要求，并且设法同机车司机司炉联合会及其他铁路工人的工会组织取得协议，以便一致行动。
    伦敦的四千七百个驳船、拖船工人也已经在八日提出了每天增加工资十先令六便士的要求。
    西德工人展开争取增加工资的斗争
    西德工人要求增加工资运动的规模日益扩大，现在卷入这个运动的已经有约三百万名工人和职员。
    西德公务员工会已经宣布终止对西德全境大约八十万名工人和职员有效的工资协议。宣布终止工资协议的其他大工会还有瓦登堡—巴登州五金工人工会（代表四十万工人）、西德铁路工人工会（代表西德全境约二十七万名铁路工人）、化学工人工会（代表瓦登堡—巴登州的大约三万四千名职工）以及银行和保险公司工会（代表黑森州的一万八千名会员）。伙食工人工会、纸业工会和纺织业工人工会等较小的工会也在若干州内或西德全境终止了它们的工资协议。
    西德工人要求增加工资运动的高涨是由于一年来西德生活费用不断上涨。
    法国南特港工人为提高工资而斗争
    南特港消息：法国南特港正在为增加工资而斗争的工人在十八日下午举行了好几千人的示威。法国当局派出“共和国保安队”用棍棒和催泪弹向工人进攻，使得好几十人受重伤。
    据报纸报道，南特港布列塔尼和罗亚尔造船工厂、西南国家飞机制造公司各企业、炼钢工厂及其他工厂的工人，在隶属法国总工会、天主教劳工联盟和工人力量总工会的各个工会领导之下，提出了要求每小时增加工资四十法郎的要求。他们在十七日为这件事举行了一个五千多人的大会，并且派代表同资方谈判。资方在谈判中答应满足工人的要求，但是事后却拒绝履行诺言，并且决定关闭这些企业。工人十八日的大示威就是为了表示他们的抗议。
    智利和乌拉圭的罢工运动日益高涨
    苏联“劳动报”七月三十日刊载了吉洪诺夫和舒柳金的评述国际工人运动的文章。文章论述了智利和乌拉圭七月中发生的罢工情况。作者指出，罢工的主要原因是由于美国垄断资本家的控制和同美国垄断资本家有联系的某些集团的反民族政策所引起的人民群众生活的急剧恶化。作者写道：七月上半月的特点是智利劳动人民罢工斗争的规模前所未有。
    在团结着四十四个工会联合会的智利工人统一工会的号召下，工业、运输业和机关的一百二十万职工在七月初停止了工作。罢工使得智利的各种活动几乎完全瘫痪了。各个工厂、铁路和机关的生活也都停滞了。
    作者指出：为了支持首先开始罢工的铁路、邮电和公共汽车工人，全国宣布了总罢工。从力量和规模来看，这次罢工是智利工人阶级有史以来的最大一次的罢工。它简直席卷了全国。参加罢工的占智利全部人口的五分之一以上。罢工表明了工人阶级的壮大和它保护自己权利的决心。罢工还显示了劳动人民的团结和组织的力量。正是由于这种缘故，智利政府不久以前才不得不同意运输工人和邮电工人提出的关于至少增加工资百分之六十和制定支付养老金的新条件的要求。
    作者继续说，同智利工人的战斗进攻遥相呼应的是乌拉圭劳动人民的罢工斗争。乌拉圭首都的无产阶级七月二十二日在蒙得维的亚举行了几年以来的最大的罢工之一。　（据新华社讯）
