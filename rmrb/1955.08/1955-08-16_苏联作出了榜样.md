    The Soviet Union Sets an Example

    Since the end of the Four-Power Heads of Government Conference, people of all countries have been eagerly hoping that the spirit of Geneva will be maintained, and especially that the four major powers can take practical actions to promote the resolution of pressing international issues such as disarmament, so as to increase trust among nations and consolidate lasting peace. In this regard, after the Four-Power Conference, the Soviet Union, adhering to its consistent peaceful diplomatic policy, has continued to do a lot of work. In order to strengthen Soviet-British and Soviet-French relations, Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin and Soviet Supreme Soviet Presidium member Nikita Khrushchev have accepted invitations to visit Britain in the spring of next year; at the same time, the Soviet government has invited French Prime Minister Edgar Faure and French Foreign Minister Antoine Pinay to visit the Soviet Union. The grand reception held by Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin on August 7 for diplomatic envoys from various countries has also greatly helped to enhance trust and a friendly atmosphere among nations. In the spirit of the Geneva Conference, the Soviet government also announced on July 31 that it would withdraw all Soviet troops stationed in Austria to Soviet territory before October 1, and reduce the total number of Soviet troops by the number of personnel equivalent to those withdrawn from Austria. Now, in order to further ease international tensions and establish trust between countries, the Soviet government has decided to reduce the size of the Soviet armed forces by 640,000 personnel before December 15, 1955. All these facts, especially the Soviet Union's announcement of a reduction of 640,000 troops this year, clearly illustrate that the profound impact of the Four-Power Conference is being manifested in practical actions. The Soviet Union has set a clear example.
    Universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons are key issues in consolidating lasting peace. The Soviet Union's announcement of this year's troop reduction is a major step in this direction. At the Geneva Conference, the heads of government of Western countries expressed their desire to promote the realization of disarmament. In his speech at the meeting on July 21, US President Dwight Eisenhower said: "The best way to defend peace and ensure the security of the United States is a system that can reduce the level and size of the armed forces of all countries." In their instructions to the foreign ministers, the four heads of state also requested the foreign ministers to explore the possibility of the four governments taking further initiatives in disarmament. Now that the Soviet Union has taken the initiative to announce a reduction in the number of troops, people have every reason to expect Western countries to take corresponding actions to fulfill the promises of their heads of government. There is no doubt that if Western countries can all take such actions, it can lead to the realization of the great goal of universal disarmament.
    Some people are troubled by the Soviet Union's announcement of a reduction in the armed forces, and they are afraid that this matter will increase the pressure to demand troop reductions. Some people try to belittle the significance of this action, saying that it is because they cannot inspect the Soviet army. Some people say that the Soviet Union should disarm, but Western countries should not disarm. Of course, these words are untenable. First, the Soviet Union cannot inspect the armies of Western countries either, but the Soviet Union still wants to reduce its own army. Second, the Soviet Union immediately demobilized its troops after the end of World War II, and Western countries also claimed that they had done so, but everyone knows that Western countries have used all their strength to expand their armies in the past few years. Since this is the case, the Soviet Union is now reducing its army in order to ease the situation, and Western countries have no reason to say that they should not or cannot do so.

### 苏联作出了榜样

    苏联作出了榜样
    四国政府首脑会议结束以来，各国人民热烈地希望日内瓦的精神保持下去，特别希望四大国能够采取实际行动来促进诸如裁减军备之类迫切的国际问题的解决，以增进国际间的信任和巩固持久和平。在这方面，苏联在四国会议之后本着一贯的和平外交政策，已经继续作了很多工作。为了加强苏英、苏法的关系，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫已接受邀请，决定于明年春天访问英国；同时，苏联政府已邀请法国总理富尔和法国外交部长比内访问苏联。苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在八月七日举行的招待各国外交使节的盛大招待会，对于增进各国之间的信任和友好的气氛也有着很大的帮助。本着日内瓦会议的精神，苏联政府还在七月三十一日宣布在十月一日以前把驻在奥地利的苏联军队全部撤回苏联领土，并且在苏联军队的总人数中裁减相等于从奥地利撤出的军队的数目的人员。现在，为了进一步和缓国际紧张局势和确立国与国间的信任，苏联政府又决定在一九五五年十二月十五日以前，把苏联武装部队人数减少六十四万人。这一切事实，特别是苏联宣布今年裁军六十四万人的事实，再清楚不过地说明了四国会议的深远影响正在实际行动中得到表现。苏联已经作出了鲜明的榜样。
    普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器是巩固持久和平的关键问题。苏联宣布今年的裁军数目是朝着这个方向所采取的重大步骤。在日内瓦会议上，西方国家政府首脑曾表示了促进实现裁减军备的愿望。美国总统艾森豪威尔在七月二十一日的会议上的发言中就曾说：“保卫和平和保障美国安全的最好办法就是能够降低各国武装力量水平和缩小它的规模的制度。” 四国首脑在给外长们的指示中，并要求外长们探讨四国政府在裁减军备方面主动采取进一步行动的可能。现在苏联已经首先采取行动，宣布裁减军队人数，人们完全有理由期待西方国家能够采取相应的行动来实践它们政府首脑的诺言。毫无疑问，如果西方国家都能这样采取行动，就能够导致普遍裁减军备这个伟大目标的实现。
    有些人对苏联宣布裁减武装部队感到头痛，他们害怕由于这件事情而增加的要求裁减军队的压力。有些人设法贬低这个行动的意义，说是因为他们不能检查苏联军队。有些人说苏联裁军是应该的，西方国家却不应该裁军。当然这些话都是站不住脚的。第一，苏联也不能检查西方国家的军队，然而苏联却还是要裁减自己的军队。第二，苏联在第二次大战结束之后，立即把它的军队复了员，西方国家也自称它们是这样做了的，但是，人人都知道西方国家在过去几年中用了全力来扩充军队。既是这样，苏联现在为了和缓局势而裁减军队，西方国家也就没有理由说它们不应该或者不能够这样做。
