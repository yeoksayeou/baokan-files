    A Salute to the Korean People
    Yang Shuo
    It has been over a year since I left Korea, but my heart often thinks of Korea. I miss the mountains and rivers of Korea, and even more, I miss the people of Korea. I miss the mountains and rivers of Korea not just because the scenery is beautiful, but because in that scenery, I experienced shared hardships and joys with the Korean people. I miss the Korean people, not just those friends with whom I had close relationships, but each and every one of you from the bottom of my heart.
    To be honest, I love you. Your national character is so profound yet passionate, kind yet brave. You understand your own destiny, understand the path of your struggle, and never lose heart. What I love is this kind of nation with ideals: always facing tomorrow, facing the future.
    I remember during the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, one night, wind and snow raged, before dawn, I found a family to stay with. This family consisted of only a father and daughter, and they didn't live in a house, but a cave dug into an earthen slope. The daughter lit a lamp, made room for me to rest, and was very attentive. Her old father lay still, looking unwell. I thought the father didn't like me disturbing them, but the daughter quickly whispered, "My father's heart hurts, don't mind it. We used to have a house, but it was bombed, and I also had a little brother who was killed." As she spoke, her eyes welled up with tears.
    The old father suddenly sat up and asked, "Is it almost dawn?"
    The daughter said, "Not yet, you sleep."
    The father said, "I can't sleep soundly, I'm just waiting for dawn."
    Before dawn, this old man carried a sack of rice, nodded to me, opened the door, and braved the wind and snow to leave. He was going to deliver military supplies to the Korean People's Army. I knew how much pain the old man was in, but he endured it. He was looking forward to dawn, to a new life tomorrow. He was not waiting for tomorrow; he knew how to fight for tomorrow with action.
    Tomorrow finally arrived, and that was victory, that was peace. That night, the night the US imperialists were forced to sign the armistice at Panmunjom, I knew the joyful mood with which the entire North Korean people welcomed victory. Every household took down the air-raid straw curtains, opened their windows and doors wide, lit lamps, and some even lit bonfires in their yards, with adults and children dancing and singing around the fire.
    This is a nation that is willing to dedicate itself to others. Such people will never be alone. Behind you, there are the Soviet people, the Chinese people, and the people of many other countries supporting you. Under the guidance of the Workers' Party, you finally defeated the Japanese imperialists who had ravaged you for a long time ten years ago, and two years ago, you defeated the US imperialists, breaking through many difficulties to get to where you are today. Today, you can use your full fighting spirit to create your free and peaceful life.
    Chinese brothers are always concerned about you. Whenever we see people from Korea, we always ask, "How is the construction in Korea going?" We believe that you will build well with the help of many international friends. But we still want to hear more and more good news. We want to hear about your harvests, new production records from your factories and mines, and everything you create for life. Last July, when I was still in Pyongyang, I stood on Moranbong Hill and looked at Pyongyang. I saw red flags fluttering everywhere. These were flags planted on Stalin Road, Mao Zedong Square, and Kim Il Sung Square, which were under construction at the time. Under the red flags, countless people were working selflessly. Among them were Korean men, Korean women, and the Chinese People's Volunteers, who are as close to you as brothers. Along Stalin Road, through Mao Zedong Square and Kim Il Sung Square, your cause is advancing, and will advance to a farther and farther tomorrow.
    The starting point of victory should be attributed to "August 15th" ten years ago, the day you defeated the Japanese invaders with the help of the Soviet Red Army. On that day, the Korean people faced a brand-new history and a brand-new era for the first time. It has been ten years from that day to now, which is not a short journey. For ten years, you have protected your cause with your lives and labor, and built your beautiful life. There will still be thorns, stumbling blocks, and all the obstacles created by the enemy on the road ahead. But I believe that you will surely cut through thorns and brambles and open up a greater world. Every inch and every foot of progress between us is beneficial to our common cause. Let me congratulate you on the victories you have already achieved, and wish you even greater victories to come, and may we advance together.

    向朝鲜人民致敬
    杨朔
    我离开朝鲜，已经一年多了，我的心里却常常想念朝鲜。我想念朝鲜的山，朝鲜的水，更想念朝鲜的人民。我想念朝鲜的山水，不只是因为朝鲜的山水好看，而是因为在那片山水中间，我曾经和朝鲜人民经历过共同的艰苦和欢乐。我想念朝鲜人民，也不只是想念那些跟我有过亲密关系的朋友们，我是从心里想念你们每个人。
    说实话吧，我爱你们。你们的民族性格是那么深沉而又热情，善良而又勇敢。你们懂得自己的命运，懂得自己斗争的道路，却从来不懂得灰心丧气。我爱的就是这种富有理想的民族：永远面向着明天，面向着未来。
    还记得抗美援朝战争期间，有一天夜晚，风雪交加，黎明前，我寻到一户人家宿营。这家人只有父女两个，住的也不是什么房子，不过是靠着土坡挖的洞。女儿点起盏灯，给我腾地方休息，满殷勤的。她的老父亲却躺着不动，神气很不好。我以为父亲是不喜欢我来搅扰他们，女儿赶紧悄悄说：“我父亲心痛呢，你别多心。我们早先有房子，叫炸弹炸光了，我还有个小兄弟，也炸死了。”说着，眼泪汪汪的。
    老父亲忽然翻身坐起来问：“天明不明？”
    女儿说：“还不明，你睡你的吧。”
    父亲说：“我睡不稳，就是盼着天明啊。”
    不等天明，这位老人就背起一草袋子米，朝我点点头，打开门，冒着风雪走了。他是去给朝鲜人民军送军粮的。我知道，老人家的心有多么痛苦，但他忍着。他盼着天明，明天将有明天的生活。他并不等待明天，他知道应该怎样用行动去争取明天。
    明天终于到来了，这就是胜利，这就是和平。那一晚上，就是美帝国主义被迫在板门店签字停战的那晚上，我知道，整个北朝鲜的人民是用怎样欢乐的心情来迎接胜利的。家家户户摘下防空的草帘子，大开着窗门，点起灯火，也有在院里燃起堆柴火的，大人孩子围着火跳，围着火唱。
    这是个勇于为旁人献身的民族。这样的人民是永远不会孤独的。在你们背后，有苏联人民，有中国人民，有许许多多国家的人民支持着你们。你们终于在劳动党的指引下面，十年前战胜了长期蹂躏你们的日本帝国主义，两年前又战胜了美帝国主义，突破重重困难，走到今天。今天更可以用饱满的战斗精神，创造你们自由和平的生活了。
    中国兄弟们无时无刻不在殷切地关怀着你们。每逢见到从朝鲜来的人，我们开头总要问：“朝鲜建设的怎样了？”我们相信，你们得到许多国际朋友的帮助，准会建设得很好的。但我们还是愿意听到更多更多的好消息。我们愿意听到你们的丰收，听到你们工厂矿山的生产新纪录，听到你们对生活所创造的一切。去年七月，我还在平壤时，我曾经站在牡丹峰上，望着平壤。我望见四处飘扬着的红旗。这是插在当时正在修建的斯大林路，毛泽东广场，金日成广场上的旗帜。在红旗下面，数不尽的人群正在忘我地劳动着。这里边有朝鲜男子，朝鲜妇女，还有你们亲如手足的中国人民志愿军。就是沿着斯大林路，通过毛泽东广场，金日成广场，你们的事业在前进着，将要前进到更远更远的明天。
    胜利的起点应该归结到十年前的“八·一五”，就是你们在苏联红军的援助下战胜日寇的那天。那一天，朝鲜人民头一次面临着崭新的历史，崭新的时代。从那一天到现在已经十年了，这不是段很短的路程。十年来，你们用生命，用劳动，保卫了你们的事业，建设着你们的美好生活。未来的路上仍然会有荆棘，有绊脚石，有敌人制造的一切障碍。可是我相信，你们一定能够斩荆披棘，开辟出更远大的世界。我们之间每一寸每一尺的前进，都有利于我们共同的事业。让我祝贺你们已经取得的胜利，预祝你们将要取得的更大的胜利，愿我们共同前进。
