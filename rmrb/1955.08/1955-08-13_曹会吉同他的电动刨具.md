    Cao Huiji and His Electric Planer
    Gu Ping
    Recently, a new electric planer appeared in the woodworking shop of the Second Construction Site of the Xianyang Engineering Office of the Northwest Fifth Engineering Company. The planer is simple in construction: a wooden frame about one meter wide and two meters long is equipped with an iron axle. The axle is fitted with various shaped planing knives, driven by a motor to rotate the axle. When wood is fed into it, it can plane out mortises and different styles of door and window moldings. Only a woodworker of the third or fourth grade is needed to operate the electric planer.
    This electric planer was created by Cao Huiji, the leader of the sixth woodworking group at this construction site. In April of this year, the sixth woodworking group accepted the task of making doors and windows. The quota stipulated on the work order was that when making finished products within 0.6 square meters, each worker (average fourth grade worker) should complete 10.5 sashes per day. This woodworking group of thirteen people should complete more than 140 sashes per day. On the first day of making doors and windows, the entire group only completed 40 sashes. The second day, they improved the labor organization, but only completed 109 sashes. On the third day, they used great effort to complete 131 sashes. What should they do if they could not meet the quota? The sixth woodworking group held an emergency meeting. Everyone at the meeting analyzed the reasons for not meeting the quota. On the one hand, the wood being processed this time was thick and hard, and it took a lot of effort to plane off half a centimeter of wood. On the other hand, the people in the group were not skilled in operating the two-person hand-pulled mortise planing tool. The production quota could not be achieved without changing the above situation.
    After the meeting, Cao Huiji was determined to improve the tools in order to increase the production quota. In the past, he had seen hand-pushed wood planers and wanted to improve the manually operated planer based on the principle of the hand-pushed wood planer. The tool he envisioned was relatively simple, requiring only a motor, an axle, and a wooden frame. He told his ideas to veteran technicians Nie Suilai, Fan Julin, Yang Shude, and others, and they all agreed that it could be done. Cao Huiji made the electric planer according to his original plan. On the day of the new planer's test, the construction site leaders also sent electricians to help him. Who knew, this test failed! The wood was beaten loudly and bounced under the planing blade, unable to plane anything at all. Cao Huiji carefully studied the reasons for the failure and found that the planing blade rotated from top to bottom, so the wood could not pass through the planing blade. Of course, it could not plane anything. The problem could be solved by turning the planing blade upside down so that it rotated from bottom to top. After re-installation, the new electric planer was finally successfully tested. The planed material was smooth and flat, and the quality fully met the requirements.
    Now, this new electric production tool has been officially put into production. In addition to not being able to make mortises, other operations such as planing wood, planing tenons, trimming edges, and molding lines can be done. According to preliminary calculations: planing wood of various specifications can increase work efficiency by more than three times, planing tenons at the structure of doors and windows can increase efficiency by more than one time, and planing lines on doors and windows and planing the wood edges for installing door and window glass can increase efficiency by two to three times.
    Cao Huiji is now studying how to make a tool that can make mortises in wood.

    曹会吉同他的电动刨具
    古平
    在西北第五工程公司咸阳工程处第二工地木工工作棚里，最近出现了一台新的电动刨具。这个刨具构造很简单：在一个约一公尺宽、二公尺长的木架上装一根铁轴，轴上装着形状不同的刨刀，由马达带动轮轴旋转，把木料送上去就能刨出木榫以及式样不同的门窗线等。负责操作电动刨具的只要一个三、四级木工就行了。
    这台电动刨具是这个工地木工第六组组长曹会吉创造的。今年四月份，木工第六组接受了制作门窗的任务，工程任务单上规定的定额是做零点六平方公尺以内的成品时，每工（平均四级工）每天应完成十点五扇，这个木工组共十三人，每天应完成一百四十多扇。开始制作门窗的第一天全组仅完成四十扇，第二天改进了劳动组织，也只完成一百零九扇，第三天用了很大的力量才完成一百三十一扇。达不到定额怎么办呢？木工第六小组开了个紧急会议，大家在会上分析达不到定额的原因，一方面是这次加工的木料厚而硬，想把木料刨去半公分就要花费很大力气；另一方面是小组里的人对双人手拉刨榫工具操作不熟练。不改变上述情况就无法达到生产定额。
    会后，曹会吉就下决心要改进工具，以提高生产定额。过去，他看见过手押刨木机，就想根据手押刨木机的原理改进用人工操作的刨具。他所想的这种工具比较简单，只要一部马达、一个轮轴、一个木架就可以了。他把这个想法告诉了老技工聂遂来、范菊林、杨树德等，他们也一致认为能行。曹会吉按照原来的计划把电动刨具做成了。试验新刨具的那天，工地领导上也派来电工帮助他。谁知，这次试验竟失败了！木料在刨刃下面被打得又响又跳，一点也刨不动。曹会吉细心研究了失败的原因，发现刨刃是自上而下地转，这样木料无法穿过刨刃，当然是刨不动了，只要把刨刃倒过来，使它自下而上的转动，问题就解决了。经过重新装置，新的电动刨具终于试验成功了，刨出的料又光又平，质量完全合乎要求。
    现在，这台新的电动生产工具已经正式投入生产，它除了还不能打木眼外，其它如刨木料、刨榫、裁口、起线等工序的操作都可以。据初步计算：刨各种规格的木料可提高工作效率三倍以上，刨门窗结构处的榫可提高效率一倍以上，刨门窗上的线条及刨安装门窗玻璃的木口时可提高效率二至三倍。
    曹会吉现在正在研究制作能在木料上凿眼的工具。
