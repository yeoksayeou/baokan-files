    Arming Natural Science with Dialectical Materialism
    ——Introducing Engels' "Dialectics of Nature"
    Ai Siqi
    I
    On the sixtieth anniversary of Engels' death, we would like to recommend his unfinished great work, "Dialectics of Nature." This has very important practical significance for us: First, this work synthesizes all the important achievements of natural science development before Engels' death, especially the three great discoveries of the nineteenth century—the theory of evolution, cell theory, and the law of conservation and mutual transformation of energy, which laid an unshakable scientific foundation for Marxist philosophy—dialectical materialism. The pragmatist Hu Shih, in slandering Marxism, insisted that Marxist dialectics was an old idea that predated the theory of evolution. "Dialectics of Nature" proves that the weapon used by this bourgeois idealist, who verbally flaunted "respect for facts," is precisely a shameful lie with no factual basis. Second, Engels repeatedly and in detail argues in "Dialectics of Nature" that natural science, in its own development process, is increasingly urgently in need of dialectical materialism as an ideological weapon, and how it needs to oppose the influence of bourgeois idealism and metaphysics. Currently, in China's natural science circles, generally speaking, there is no clear understanding of this point, and we should learn more from "Dialectics of Nature." If we look again at an important aspect of the recently exposed Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group's conspiracy, which is to try every means to ideologically separate literary and art workers and the general intellectual circles from the Marxist worldview, then we can better understand the importance of the principles elaborated by Engels, and we should more seriously study "Dialectics of Nature." Because the counter-revolutionaries' plot of ideological poisoning does not exclude natural science workers but is limited to dealing with literary and art workers.
    In the "Introduction" to "Dialectics of Nature," Engels summarized the entire history of natural science development, pointing out that modern natural science opened up its path of progress in the process of a cruel struggle against the authority of religious theology and in breaking through the many obstacles of idealism and metaphysics. In its early stage of development (sixteenth century), modern natural science "was itself thoroughly revolutionary" ("Dialectics of Nature," Chinese translation, People's Publishing House, page 6), and it had to "fight for its right to exist" under the spiritual oppression of feudal society. In order to "challenge the church's authority in natural matters," "natural science sent its martyrs to the stake and the prisons of the Inquisition" (ibid.). After such a cruel struggle, it then "advanced with giant strides and gained a force that could be said to be proportional to the square of the (temporal) distance from its starting point" (ibid.).
    However, the theological cage for natural science could not be easily shattered by a single assault. Modern natural science entered the metaphysical period as soon as it took its first step in development. Due to the limitations of the metaphysical way of thinking, the natural science community fell into the trap of theological concepts on some fundamental issues. Engels said of the thinking of the natural science community at that time:
    "Science was still deeply imprisoned in theology. Everywhere it sought and found ultimate causes in impulses that could not be explained from nature itself. If the attraction, which Newton exaggeratedly named universal gravitation, was regarded as a fundamental property of matter, then where did the unexplained tangential force that first created the planetary orbits come from? How did the countless categories of plants and animals arise? And how did the first human beings, whose existence was already proven not to be eternal, arise? To such questions, natural science often answered that the Creator of all things was responsible for this. Copernicus wrote a letter of severance to theology at the beginning of this period; while Newton ended this period with the assumption of God's first impulse" (page 8).
    Modern natural science broke through the shackles of church power in its early stage in the sixteenth century, thus opening up a path for its rapid development. By the eighteenth century, Newton's era, it had to break through the shackles of metaphysics and theology, otherwise it would be difficult to move forward.
    If anyone does not believe how necessary it was for natural science at that time to break through the shackles of metaphysics and theology, if they cannot understand how great an obstacle these erroneous ways of thinking and erroneous concepts were to the progress of science, then they should carefully consider the facts pointed out by Engels. In 1755, the philosopher Kant had already written "General Natural History and Theory of the Heavens," explaining the formation process of the solar system with a theory equivalent to the "nebular hypothesis." Regardless of how much the specific content of this theory proved to be inconsistent with the facts in the later development of natural science, regardless of the fact that Kant's own philosophical system, on the whole, was an erroneous dualism and idealism, the basic idea of this early work contained genius and correct elements. It broke with Newton's metaphysical concept of viewing the solar system as moving in the same way forever after receiving God's first impulse, and replaced this "rigid view of nature" (page 9) with the dialectical idea of development. However, although a philosopher had broken a gap in the metaphysical concept, the natural scientists of that time could not break free from their own thinking through this gap, which delayed the progress of natural science for many years. Because, if natural science could have seriously implemented the line of thought initially unfolded in Kant's work at that time, then the great scientific discovery like the theory of evolution would not have had to wait until the mid-nineteenth century to be completed, and many other similar new scientific discoveries could have been made earlier.
    II
    Why must natural science struggle against church power, theology, idealism, and metaphysics in its own development process in order to move forward smoothly? Why can natural science avoid wasting infinite time and labor by groping in endless detours if it grasps the correct philosophical direction? This is because all scientific research, including natural science, not only relies on and starts from experience, but also needs theory to synthesize all experience; it not only needs to collect, correct, and sort out a large amount of positive knowledge materials, but also needs to find its internal connections and internal regularity from these knowledge materials. The main task of science is precisely to reflect the laws of development of objective things in the form of theory through the research process of empirical knowledge. To complete this important task of scientific research, to make a correct theoretical explanation of the object of research, that is, to understand its objective regularity, one must have a correct philosophical viewpoint as an ideological guide. Engels said:
    "Empirical natural science has collected such a vast quantity of positive knowledge materials that the need to systematically sort them out and arrange them according to their internal connections in every field of research has simply become unavoidable. Establishing the correct connections between the various fields of knowledge has also become unavoidable. But natural science has therefore entered the realm of theory, where the method of experience is useless and where one can only turn to theoretical thinking. But theoretical thinking is only an innate ability. This ability must be developed and exercised, and for this exercise, there is no other means than studying past philosophy until now" (page 23).
    The importance of theoretical thinking lies not only in its ability to synthesize existing experience and positive knowledge materials, but also in its ability to make further logical inferences about things based on the conclusions drawn from current experience and knowledge materials. The logical inferences of correct theoretical thinking may suggest new principles that current empirical knowledge has not yet fully proven, but can be expected to be fully proven in the future. Therefore, such inferences become the guidance for further research in science, and thus promote the continuous advancement of science. Many scientific hypotheses have such a role, which is generally understood by natural scientists. However, what natural scientists often fail to understand is that such logical inferences in philosophy often have a broader and more noteworthy significance than hypotheses in natural science. Kant's theory on the formation of the solar system is an example. Engels' "Dialectics of Nature" also cites another important example: As early as the end of the seventeenth century, the German philosopher Descartes had already pointed out that "the amount of motion existing in the world is constant" (page 11), while in natural science, the law of conservation of energy was not finally proven until the nineteenth century. Therefore, Engels said: "Propositions that have been determined in philosophy hundreds of years ago, propositions that have long been abandoned in philosophy, often appear in theoretical natural science as completely new wisdom, and even become fashionable at one time" (page 24). Engels instructs us that we must attach importance to this role of theoretical thinking in promoting and guiding natural science, saying: "In theoretical natural science, we often have to calculate incompletely known quantities, and the consistency of thought should at all times help the still inadequate knowledge to continue to advance. Now, modern natural science must adopt the principle of the imperishability of motion from philosophy; it cannot continue to exist without this principle" (page 18).
    The correct method of theoretical thinking is materialist dialectics. The weapon that natural scientists need to acquire from the study of philosophy in their thinking is the dialectical materialist worldview. Engels' great work "Dialectics of Nature" only aims to prove one thing from beginning to end: the achievements of all natural science show that everything in nature operates dialectically, therefore the only correct way to understand the natural world is materialist dialectics. If natural scientists can consciously grasp the dialectical materialist worldview, they can greatly increase the effectiveness of research and promote the faster progress of science.
    Our natural scientists often have such prejudices: scientific workers do not need to care about philosophy; not learning philosophy, while not understanding dialectical materialism, will not lead to idealism. This view is not in accordance with the facts. Any scientific worker, whether he is willing or not, once engaged in scientific research, cannot but carry out theoretical thinking activities to a certain extent, and once engaged in theoretical thinking activities, he will inevitably apply one or another philosophical way of thinking, even if unconsciously. Either the ideological method of materialism and dialectics, or the ideological method of idealism and metaphysics. And if we cannot apply the ideological method of dialectical materialism, we will inevitably be influenced by idealism and metaphysics. Moreover, for natural scientists who grew up in the old society, the influence of the erroneous worldview of idealism and metaphysics on them is always much stronger, and it is always more difficult to consciously grasp the dialectical materialist worldview. This is because idealism and metaphysics are the ideological weapons of the ruling bourgeois and other exploiting classes in the old society, and people's thinking in the old society has a long-standing and deeply rooted force. Because scientists usually only pay attention to the research of their own specialized business, and cannot identify the poison of these ruling ideas through philosophical research, they will inevitably be ideologically eroded by the ideas and worldview of these exploiting classes. Especially in modern times, the bourgeoisie and reactionary forces, which are increasingly heading towards extinction, are doing everything possible to spread the most decadent subjective idealism influence in various fields of thought, taking this as one of the most important methods of their desperate struggle. At such a time, progressive people, including those in the natural science community, must be more vigilant and strive to consciously grasp the dialectical materialist worldview in the study of philosophy and eliminate the poison of these decadent ideas. Lenin, in his article "On the Significance of Militant Materialism," has this passage, which is worth pondering repeatedly:—
    "One should know that any natural science, any materialism, if it does not put forward powerful philosophical arguments, cannot withstand the attacks of bourgeois ideas, nor can it prevent the restoration of the bourgeois worldview. In order to sustain this struggle, in order to carry this struggle through to complete victory, then the natural scientist must be a modern materialist, a conscious believer in the materialism represented by Marx, that is, must be a dialectical materialist."
    "Without putting forward powerful philosophical arguments," it is impossible to "prevent the restoration of the bourgeois worldview." This is the iron law on the ideological front. This warns us not to weaken the ideological struggle and relax the study of dialectical materialism. This principle becomes more and more important in modern times. Natural scientists, because they did not grasp the ideological method of materialist dialectics and could not synthesize the new achievements of natural science, fell into the trap of idealism. Lenin, in "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism," criticized some scientists for drawing the conclusion that "matter has disappeared" due to the discovery of electrons, which is a good example. Although Lenin refuted this fallacy more than forty years ago, there are still people in the physics community of capitalist countries repeating it, and it still has an impact on the scientific community in China. We have recently heard individual scientists with such erroneous views. This shows that the natural science community in China is very much in need of the ideological method of dialectical materialism.
    Modern bourgeois idealists, in order to oppose Marxism and dialectical materialism, have adopted such a cunning step: first, they distort natural science with the point of view of empiricism, trying to make people believe that scientific research relies solely on empirical methods, so that people engaged in scientific work will relax the exercise of theoretical thinking and weaken the ability of ideological struggle, so that they can be easily guided to the wrong path of bourgeois idealism and even mysticism. Since the nineteenth century, bourgeois idealist philosophies that have been labeled with names such as "positivism," "neo-positivism," "empirio-criticism," and "pragmatism" have all adopted the same deceptive trick. Engels' "Dialectics of Nature" cites some of the most prominent examples, illustrating the destructiveness of empiricism to scientific thought. He pointed out that among scientists "who rely solely on experience, who are very contemptuous of thinking, and who have actually reached the point of extreme lack of thought," one can find "extreme fantasy, blind obedience, and superstition" (page 29). The empiricist Bacon "once longed to use his new empirical induction method to first achieve longevity, a certain degree of rejuvenation, changing one's appearance, changing one's bones, creating new species, and summoning wind and rain." "Newton also buried himself in interpreting the 'Book of Revelation' in his later years." Wallace, "who established the theory of species evolution with natural selection at the same time as Darwin," easily blindly followed the trickery of Hall, a "mediocre quack doctor." It should be pointed out that the empiricism spread by modern bourgeois philosophers is itself idealistic. And this idealistic empiricism is not lacking in people in our Chinese natural science community who are influenced by it. Idealists say: "Man has nothing but experience; man is reaching everything he reaches only through experience" (Lenin: "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism"); some of our natural scientists have similar agnostic arguments: "Natural science only studies experience, and nothing outside of experience can be affirmed." The pragmatist Dewey only regards the sun, mountains, rivers, and the earth as elements of experience, denying that matter is an objective existence outside of experience. Some of our natural scientists also use similar idealistic viewpoints to view matter, saying: "Matter is what I see, what I touch, and what I use for experiments. That is to say, without my senses, my scientific research experience, it cannot be called matter." Therefore, opposing idealism and empiricism, learning dialectical materialism, and improving our ability of theoretical thinking are very necessary for our Chinese intellectual circles, including the natural science community.
    III
    China has now entered an unprecedented period of socialist construction and socialist transformation in its history. Our National People's Congress has recently passed the Five-Year Plan, which is a great scientific plan to transform nature and transform society. In transforming nature, that is, developing industry and agriculture, in addition to the scientific and technological assistance from the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, we also urgently need our country's natural science community to contribute its greatest strength. The number of natural scientists in our country is very small, and they are the country's precious treasures. Our natural scientists once experienced the pain of "having no place to use their talents" in the old society. Now that they have encountered an era in which they can give full play to their abilities, they are naturally very excited and encouraged. However, in order to give full play to the greatest strength of the natural science community, it is necessary to create various conditions that can enable it to give full play, and to remove various obstacles to scientific development. Relying solely on enthusiasm and wishes cannot solve the problem. Here, we should point out that grasping dialectical materialism, this correct idea, is one of the important conditions for helping the natural science community to give full play to its greatest strength, and that bourgeois idealist ideas are obstacles that must be removed.
    Some people in our natural science community may still think that natural science has nothing to do with philosophy, and that bourgeois idealism will not have any harmful effects on natural science. Then, let us now clearly point out the harmful effects once again: First, Engels once pointed out how many years the development of natural science in the past was delayed due to the obstacles of the erroneous worldview. At present, our socialist construction is advancing at an accelerated speed that cannot be compared with the past era, therefore it also requires the development of natural science serving it to adapt to such a speed. If natural science is slow to advance due to the obstacles of ideological conditions, it will cause intolerable great losses to the socialist cause. Second, bourgeois idealist ideas will have a great destructive effect in the specific practice of science and technology. In the surveying, designing, and construction process of basic construction, due to the subjectivism and irresponsibility of engineering and technical personnel, many shocking wastes have been caused to the country. Isn't the harmfulness of Wang Bin's erroneous thinking towards the relationship between Chinese and Western medicine in medical and health work also reached an intolerable point? Third, as a natural scientist, because he cannot grasp the ideological weapon of dialectical materialism, he often unconsciously (for example, in the classroom) becomes an unpaid propagandist of bourgeois idealist philosophy. Is this also an insignificant error? In addition, in our study of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, if we do not understand dialectical materialism, it will be difficult to complete the study task. Isn't this something that many people have personally experienced?
    Some people think that natural science will not be affected by bourgeois idealism, because natural science only studies nature, studies technology, and has nothing to do with class and class struggle, and has nothing to do with politics. This idea is completely wrong! Because, to be detached from politics, to regard the research of natural science as a completely supra-class thing, and not to regard the process of scientific development and the application of industrial and agricultural technology as a serious process of class struggle and ideological struggle, this viewpoint itself is precisely an important manifestation of bourgeois idealism. Of course, the laws of natural science do not depend on people's subjective will, and the laws of nature themselves have no class character. However, the theoretical thinking that guides scientific research, the philosophical worldview that promotes scientific progress in methodology, has a class character; the application of science and technology, the practical activities of transforming nature, must go through class struggle; the scope of scientific development and the direction of application are determined by the needs of a certain class. At present, the process of scientific development and technological application in China must be a sharp and complex process of class struggle for the purpose of building socialism and against the sabotage conspiracies of counter-revolutionary elements and the resistance of the bourgeoisie. Bourgeois idealism attempts to deny these truths, that is, it attempts to obliterate the close relationship between the theory and practice of natural science. Its role is to hinder the natural science community from better serving the people and serving socialist construction, and to hinder scientific progress.
    In order to clarify the above-mentioned incorrect views, we believe that it is very necessary to recommend Engels' "Dialectics of Nature" to our natural science community. It can help us arm natural science with dialectical materialism, smash the extremely harmful bourgeois idealism, and enable the natural science community to give full play to its greatest strength for the socialist cause in accordance with the ardent expectations of the motherland.

    以辩证唯物主义武装自然科学
    ——介绍恩格斯的“自然辩证法”
    艾思奇
    一
    在恩格斯逝世六十周年的今天，我们想推荐一下他的未完成的伟大著作“自然辩证法”。这对于我们有很重要的实际意义：第一，这本著作综合了恩格斯逝世以前自然科学发展的一切重要成就，特别是十九世纪的三大发现——进化论、细胞学说，能量守恒和互相转化的规律，从这一方面给马克思主义哲学——辩证唯物主义奠立了不可动摇的科学基础。实用主义者胡适在诽谤马克思主义的时候，硬说马克思主义的辩证法是进化论出现以前的旧思想。“自然辩证法”证明：这个在口头上标榜“尊重事实”的资产阶级唯心主义者所使用的武器，恰恰就是毫无事实根据的可耻的谎言。第二，恩格斯在“自然辩证法”这本书里反复而详尽地论证了：自然科学在自己的发展过程中，是如何愈来愈更迫切地需要用辩证唯物主义哲学作为思想的武器，如何需要反对资产阶级唯心主义及形而上学的影响。目前中国的自然科学界，一般地说，对于这一点是还没有明确的理解的，应该从“自然辩证法”里来多多学习一下。如果我们再看看：最近揭露了的胡风反革命集团的阴谋活动的一个重要方面，就是要想尽一切办法，使文艺家和一般知识界在思想上离开马克思主义世界观，那我们就更可以了解到恩格斯所阐明的上述原理的重要性，就更应该认真地学习“自然辩证法”。因为反革命派的思想毒化的阴谋，并不是把自然科学工作者除外而只限于对付文艺工作者的。
    恩格斯在“自然辩证法”的“导言”里，把自然科学发展的全部历史作了总结，指出近代自然科学是在与宗教神学的权威进行残酷斗争的过程中，是在突破唯心主义和形而上学的重重障碍的过程中，才开辟了自己的进步发展的道路的。近代自然科学在它发展的初期（十六世纪），“它本身便是彻底革命的”（“自然辩证法”中译本，人民出版社版，六页），它必须在封建社会的精神压迫下“争取自己存在的权利”。为着“向教会在自然事物方面的权威挑战”，“自然科学把它的殉道者送上了火刑场和异端裁判所的牢狱。”（同上）经过这样的残酷斗争，然后它才“大踏步地前进，并且得到了一种力量，这种力量可以说是与从其出发点起的（时间的）距离之平方成正比的。”（同上）
    但是，对于自然科学的神学牢笼，并不是靠一次突击就能轻易粉碎的。近代自然科学的发展才踏出它的第一步，就进入了形而上学的时期。由于形而上学思想方法的限制，自然科学界在一些根本问题上又陷入了神学观念的圈套。恩格斯论到那时自然科学界的思想时说：
    “科学还深深地禁锢在神学之中。它到处从外面寻找和觅得从自然界本身所不能说明的推动力来做最后的原因。如果牛顿所夸张地命名为万有引力的吸力被当作物质的根本的性质，那末首先造成行星轨道的未被说明的切线力是从哪里来的呢？植物和动物的无数的类别是如何产生的呢？而早已确证并非亘古就存在着的人类最初是如何产生的呢？对于这样的问题，自然科学常常以万物创造主对此负责来回答。哥白尼在这一时期的开端给神学写了绝交书；而牛顿却以神的第一推动力的假定结束了这个时期。”（八页）
    近代自然科学在它的十六世纪的初期曾冲决了教会权力的网罗，才为自己开辟了迅速发展的道路。到了十八世纪牛顿的时代，又必须冲决形而上学、神学的网罗，否则就很难前进。
    如果有人不相信当时自然科学冲决形而上学和神学网罗是多么必要，如果他们不能理解这些错误的思想方法和错误观念对于科学的前进是多么大的障碍，那就应该仔细想一想恩格斯所指出来的这些事实。在一七五五年，哲学家康德已经写了“一般自然历史和天体理论”，以相当于“星云说”的理论说明了太阳系的形成过程。不管这个理论的具体内容在后来的自然科学发展上证明有多少是不符合事实的，不管康德自己后来建立起来的哲学体系总的来说是错误的二元论和唯心主义，但他的这部早期著作的基本思想却是包含着天才的、正确的因素，它打破了牛顿的把太阳系看做是自从接受了神的第一次推动力之后就永远不变地照样运动下去的形而上学观念，用辩证法的发展思想来代替这个“僵硬的自然观”（九页）。但是，虽然一个哲学家已把形而上学观念打破了一个缺口，而当时的自然科学家却还不能通过这个缺口把自己的思想解放出来，这就使自然科学的进步推迟了许多年。因为，如果自然科学在当时就能循着康德的著作里初步展开了的思想线索认真贯彻下去，那末，像进化论这样的伟大科学发现就不必等到十九世纪中叶才能完成了，其他许多类似的新的科学发现也可以更提早一些了。
    二
    为什么自然科学在自己的发展过程中必须与教会权力，神学，唯心主义和形而上学进行斗争，才能顺利地向前进步？为什么自然科学如果掌握了哲学上的正确方向，就可以避免因为在无穷的歧途中摸索而浪费无限的时间和劳动？这是因为，一切科学的研究，包括自然科学在内，不仅仅要依靠经验，并从经验开始，而且更需要理论，需要用理论来综合所有的经验；不仅仅需要搜集、校正和整理大量的实证知识材料，而且更需要从这些知识材料中找出它的内部联系和内部规律性。科学的主要任务，正是要通过经验知识的研究过程，以达到在理论的形式上来反映客观事物的发展规律性。要完成科学的研究的这个重要任务，要对于所研究的事物对象作出正确的理论说明即认识它的客观规律性，就必须有正确的哲学观点作为思想上的向导。恩格斯说：
    “经验的自然科学收集了如此庞大数量的实证知识材料，以致在每一个研究领域中有系统地和依据其内在联系把它们加以整理的必要就简直成为无可避免的。建立各个知识领域互相间的正确联系也同样成为无可避免的。但是自然科学因之便走进了理论的领域，而在这里经验的方法就不中用了，在这里只能求助于理论的思惟。但理论的思惟仅仅是一种天赋的能力。这种能力必须加以发展和锻炼，而为了这锻炼，除了学习以往的哲学，直到现在还没有别的手段。”（二十三页）
    理论思惟的重要性，不只是在于它能够综合既有的经验和实证知识材料，而且在于它能够依据由当前的经验和知识材料所作出的结论，来对事物进行进一步的逻辑推断。正确的理论思惟的逻辑推断，有可能提示目前的经验知识虽然还未充分证明，但却可以预期在将来一定能够获得充分证明的新原理。因而这样的推断就成为科学上的进一步研究的引导，并由此推动科学继续前进。许多科学上的假设，都有着这样的作用，这是一般自然科学家都能了解的。但是，自然科学家所常常不能了解到的是，哲学上的这种逻辑推断，往往比自然科学上的假设具有着更为广泛和更值得注意的意义。康德关于太阳系形成的学说就是一个例子。恩格斯的“自然辩证法”里还举了另一个重要的例子：还在十七世纪末年，德国的哲学家笛卡儿就已经指出“世界上存在着的运动的量是不变的”（十一页），而在自然科学上，能量守恒定律是直到十九世纪才得到最后的证明，所以，恩格斯说：“几百年前在哲学中已经确定了的命题，在哲学中早已被废弃了的命题，却常常在理论的自然科学中出现为全新的智慧，并且在一个时候甚至成为时髦的东西。”（二十四页）恩格斯指示我们必须重视理论思惟对于自然科学的这种推动和指导的作用，说：“在理论的自然科学中，我们往往不得不去计算不完全知道的数量，而思想的首尾一贯性在任何时候都应当帮助还不充分的知识继续前进。现在，近代自然科学必须从哲学那里采取运动不灭的原理；它没有这个原理便不能继续存在。”（十八页）
    正确的理论思惟方法，就是唯物辩证法。自然科学家在思想上需要从哲学的学习中取得的武器，就是辩证唯物主义的世界观。恩格斯的“自然辩证法”这部伟大著作，从头到尾就只是要证明一件事：全部自然科学的成就表明自然中的一切都是辩证地运行着的，因此认识自然界的唯一正确的方法就是唯物辩证法。自然科学家如果能自觉地掌握辩证唯物主义世界观，就可以大大地增进研究的成效，就可以推动科学加快地向前进步。
    我们的自然科学家常常有这样的偏见：科学工作者无须乎关心哲学；不学哲学，固然不懂辩证唯物主义，但也不至有唯心主义。这种看法是不符合事实的。任何科学工作者，不管他自己愿意不愿意，只要一旦从事科学研究，就不能不在一定程度上进行理论的思惟活动，而一旦进行理论的思惟活动时，就必然要——那怕是不自觉地应用这一种或那一种哲学的思惟方法。不是唯物论和辩证法的思想方法，就是唯心论和形而上学的思想方法。而如果我们不能应用辩证唯物主义的思想方法，就一定要受到唯心论和形而上学的影响。并且，就旧社会里生长起来的自然科学家来说，唯心主义和形而上学的错误世界观对于他们的影响，总是比较强烈得多，而要自觉地掌握辩证唯物主义世界观，总是更困难得多，这是因为唯心主义和形而上学是旧社会占统治地位的资产阶级及其他剥削阶级的思想武装，在旧社会里人们的思想有着长期造成的根深蒂固的势力。由于科学家平常只注意自己专门业务的研究，不能够通过哲学研究来辨认这些统治思想的毒害，他们就必然要在思想上受到这些剥削阶级的思想和世界观的侵蚀。特别是在现代，日益走向灭亡的资产阶级及反动势力千方百计地在各方面思想领域中散布最腐朽的主观唯心主义影响，把这作为它们拚命挣扎的最重要的方法之一，在这样的时候，进步的人们，包含自然科学界在内，就必须更加提高警惕，努力在哲学的学习中自觉地掌握辩证唯物主义的世界观，清除这些腐朽思想的毒害。列宁在“论战斗的唯物主义的意义”一文里，有这样一段话，值得我们反复吟味：——
    “就应该知道，任何自然科学，任何唯物主义，若不拿出强有力的哲学上的论证，就抵挡不住资产阶级观念底攻击，也阻止不了资产阶级世界观底复辟。为要支持住这个斗争，为要把这个斗争进行到底而获得完全胜利，那末自然科学家就必须做一个现代的唯物主义者，做一个马克思所代表的唯物主义底自觉信徒，即必须做一个辩证唯物主义者。”
    “不拿出强有力的哲学上的论证”，就“阻止不了资产阶级世界观底复辟”。这是思想战线上的铁的规律。这是警告我们：不能减弱思想斗争和放松辩证唯物主义的学习。这个原则，愈到现代，就愈加重要。自然科学家因为没有掌握唯物辩证法的思想方法，不能综合自然科学的新成就，因而滚落到唯心主义陷阱中。列宁在“唯物论与经验批判论”里曾批判某些科学家由于电子的发现而作出“物质消灭了”的结论，就是一个很好的例子。虽然列宁在四十多年前已经驳倒了这种谬论，但资本主义国家的物理学界还有人重复着它，而且对于中国的科学界也还有着影响，我们在最近还听到个别的科学家有这类的错误看法。这就说明中国的自然科学界很需要辩证唯物主义的思想方法。
    现代资产阶级唯心主义者为着反对马克思主义和辩证唯物主义，采取了这样一种狡猾的步骤：首先用经验主义的观点来曲解自然科学，力图使人相信科学研究仅仅是依靠经验方法，使科学工作的人因此放松了理论思惟的锻炼，削弱了思想斗争的能力，这样就可以轻轻巧巧地把他们引导到资产阶级唯心主义以至于神秘主义的歧途上去。从十九世纪以来，以所谓“实证主义”、“新实证主义”、“经验批判论”、“实用主义”等等名目为标榜的资产阶级唯心主义哲学，都是采用了这同一个骗人的手法。恩格斯的“自然辩证法”举了一些最突出的例子，说明了经验主义对于科学思想的破坏性，他指出：在“那种单凭经验、非常蔑视思惟、实际上走到了极端缺乏思想的地步”的科学家中间，可以找到“极端的幻想、盲从和迷信”。（二十九页）经验主义者培根“曾经渴望应用他的新的经验归纳法来首先达到延年益寿，某种程度上的返老还童，改容换貌，脱胎换骨，创造新种，呼风唤雨”。“牛顿在晚年也埋头于解释‘约翰启示录’”“和达尔文同时用自然选择建立物种进化论”（二九页）的华莱士，竟轻易盲从一个“平庸的江湖术士”霍尔的骗术。应该指出，现代资产阶级哲学家所散布的经验主义本身，就是唯心主义的。而这种唯心主义的经验主义在我们中国的自然科学界也不缺乏受它的影响的人。唯心主义者说：“人除了经验以外并没有什么东西；人是达到他仅仅透过经验而达到的一切”（列宁：“唯物论与经验批判论”）；我们的自然科学家中却有与这类似的不可知论的论调：“自然科学只研究经验，经验以外的东西则不能加以肯定”。实用主义者杜威把太阳、山河、大地都仅仅看做是经验的要素，否认物质是经验以外的客观存在。我们的自然科学家也有人用类似的唯心主义观点来看物质，说：“物质就是我看见的，我摸到的和我拿来实验的东西。这就是说，离开我的感觉，我的科学研究经验，就不成其为物质了。”所以，反对唯心主义和经验主义，学习辩证唯物主义，提高我们的理论思惟能力，这对于我们中国的知识界，包括自然科学界，是非常必要的。

    中国现在已进入了自己历史上空前未有的社会主义建设社会主义改造的时期。我们的人民代表大会最近又通过了五年计划，这是改造自然改造社会的伟大科学计划。在改造自然即发展工业和农业方面，除了苏联和各人民民主国家的科学技术帮助外，我们还迫切地需要本国的自然科学界贡献出自己最大的力量。我国的自然科学界人数很少，是国家的珍贵的财宝。我们的自然科学家在旧社会曾经历过“英雄无用武之地”的痛苦，现在逢到了这一个能够尽量施展自己的能力的时代，自然是非常兴奋鼓舞的。然而，要发挥自然科学界的最大力量，就必须要造成能使之发挥出来的种种条件，就要除去科学发展上的各种障碍。单靠热情和愿望是不能解决问题的。在这里，我们应该提出：掌握辩证唯物主义这个正确思想，是帮助自然科学界发挥最大力量的重要条件之一，而资产阶级唯心主义思想，是必须除去的障碍。
    我们的自然科学界中可能还有人认为自然科学与哲学无关，认为资产阶级唯心主义对于自然科学不会有什么危害作用。那末，现在就请让我们把危害作用再一次明确地指出来：第一，恩格斯曾指出过去的自然科学的发展曾经因为错误的世界观的障碍而推迟了多少年。目前我们的社会主义建设是以过去时代不能比拟的加快的速度前进的，因此也要求为它服务的自然科学的发展能适应于这样的速度，如果自然科学由于思想条件的障碍而迟迟不进，那就会使社会主义事业招致不能容忍的巨大损失。第二，资产阶级唯心主义思想在科学技术的具体实践中会发生很大的破坏作用。在基本建设的勘察、设计、施工过程中，由于工程技术人员的主观主义和不负责任，曾经给国家造成许多惊人的浪费。对待中西医关系的错误的王斌思想，在医药卫生工作上的危害性，不是也到了不能容忍的地步了吗？第三，身为自然科学家，由于不能掌握辩证唯物论的思想武器，往往不自觉地（例如在讲堂上）做了资产阶级唯心主义哲学的义务宣传者，这难道也是无关重要的错误吗？此外，在我们学习苏联先进经验的时候，如果不懂辩证唯物主义，就很难完成学习任务，这不是很多人都亲身体验过的吗？
    有些人以为自然科学不会受资产阶级唯心主义的影响，因为自然科学只研究自然，研究技术，和阶级与阶级斗争无关，和政治无关。这种想法是大错特错！因为，脱离政治，把自然科学的研究看做完全超阶级的东西，不把科学的发展过程和工农业技术的应用过程看做严重的阶级斗争和思想斗争的过程，这种观点的本身恰恰是资产阶级唯心主义的重要的表现。固然，自然科学的规律是不依人的主观意志为转移的，自然规律本身是没有阶级性的，但是，指导着科学研究的理论思惟，在方法上推动科学前进的哲学世界观，是有阶级性的；科学技术的运用，改造自然的实际活动，是一定要通过阶级斗争的；科学的发展范围和运用方向，是决定于一定的阶级的需要的。目前中国科学发展和技术应用的过程，就必然是为着建设社会主义而与反革命分子的破坏阴谋及资产阶级的反抗行为进行尖锐而复杂的阶级斗争的过程。资产阶级唯心主义力图否认这些真理，也就是力图抹煞自然科学的理论和实践的密切联系，其作用就是要阻碍自然科学界很好地来为人民服务，为社会主义建设服务，就是要阻碍科学前进。
    为着澄清上述种种不正确的观点，我们认为很有必要向我们的自然科学界推荐恩格斯的“自然辩证法”。它能帮助我们以辩证唯物主义来武装自然科学，粉碎极端有害的资产阶级唯心主义，使自然科学界能按照祖国的殷切期望为社会主义事业发挥它最大的力量。
