Comrade Chairman, respected! Dear comrades and friends!

Today, the Korean people celebrate the 10th anniversary of their liberation from the long yoke of Japanese imperialism by the great Soviet army, the "August 15th" anniversary.

First, please allow me to extend my heartfelt thanks and warm congratulations to the liberator of the Korean people, the sincere helper—the great Soviet Union and its armed forces—the Soviet army.

Since the day of liberation from the colonial rule of Japanese imperialism, a broad road to freedom, independence, and democracy has been opened before the Korean people, and a new page has begun in Korean history.

However, due to the fact that American imperialism, in the southern half of our country, undermined the agreements between the Allied nations during World War II and the decisions of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers, the development of democracy, to this day, has only been realized in the northern half of our homeland.

The leading force of the Korean people—the Korean Workers' Party—organized a democratic united front based on the worker-peasant alliance, and in the northern half of the Republic, utilizing the favorable conditions created by the Soviet army, mobilized all democratic forces to create a strong foundation for the unification of our country—a revolutionary democratic base.

With the active support of the broad masses of the people, the people's government carried out tremendous democratic reforms in the political, economic, and cultural spheres.

Due to the implementation of land reform, the land of Japanese imperialists and landlords was distributed to the broad masses of peasants without compensation, and the peasants became the true owners of the land. The backward rural areas of our country gradually developed economically and culturally, and a solid foundation for the worker-peasant alliance was established.

Also, due to the confiscation of the industries of Japanese imperialists and pro-Japanese national traitors, railways, transportation, postal and telecommunications, banks, etc., became the property of the whole people. The people grasped the economic lifeline, and conditions were prepared for the industrialization of our country.

Democratic labor laws and laws on equal rights for men and women were implemented, guaranteeing the democratic rights of workers, staff, and women, and an agricultural tax-in-kind law was implemented, abolishing the exorbitant taxes and levies on peasants.

Education, culture, and healthcare have also developed by leaps and bounds. In education, a policy of democratization has been implemented, greatly expanding schools and educational institutions at all levels, opening the door to education for the children of the broad working people. Under the deep care of the Korean Workers' Party and the government, our national culture and art have also developed. In February 1948, the Korean people created their own heroic armed forces—the Korean People's Army. This was an epoch-making event in the struggle to build an independent and sovereign state.

However, the southern half of our country has embarked on a completely opposite path. American imperialism, which replaced Japanese imperialism in occupying the southern half, colluded with the enemies of the Korean people—landlords, comprador capitalists, pro-Japanese elements, pro-American elements, national traitors, etc.—and established a cruel fascist police terror system in the southern half.

American imperialists turned the southern half of our country into their colony, engaged in selling goods and plundering raw materials, and in May 1948, they even created the Syngman Rhee puppet regime, directly and openly dividing Korea.

The entire Korean people launched a just struggle for the unification of the motherland and territorial integrity, against the national division policy and territorial division of American imperialism and its running dog, the Syngman Rhee puppet clique, and in September 1948, they established the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea wrote a glorious page in the history of the Korean people's struggle to build an independent and sovereign state.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was established on the united front of all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal classes based on the strong worker-peasant alliance, and broad patriotic and democratic forces were united around it. Thus, in the short period of less than five years after the liberation of the northern half of our country, a strong material foundation for the unification of the motherland—a revolutionary democratic base—was created. The five years of peaceful construction in the northern half of our country were the happiest golden age in Korean history.

However, the solemn peaceful construction of our people was interrupted by the aggressive war launched by the American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique, and the desire of the entire Korean people to realize the peaceful unification of the motherland could not be realized early.

The war was a severe test of the socio-political system of the young Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the material, spiritual, and military strength of our people. Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government, and the beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, our people gloriously withstood this severe test and, after more than three years of brutal war with the American army, which boasted of being the "strongest in the world," and the armies of its vassal states, achieved a brilliant victory.

This victory is a demonstration of the invincible vitality of our people's democratic system, and a demonstration of the noble political and moral qualities, unity, and indomitable will of our people who are unwilling to be slaves of imperialism.

Our victory is inseparable from the internationalist support and assistance of the people of the People's Republic of China and the people's democratic countries, headed by the great Soviet Union, and the peace-loving people of the world.

The great Chinese people, holding high the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea, launched a nationwide movement to aid the Korean people, giving the Korean people tremendous material and spiritual assistance. Especially during the most difficult period of our Fatherland Liberation War, the Chinese People's Volunteers were dispatched to the Korean front to assist us with their blood.

On behalf of the entire Korean people and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the great Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China and its leader Chairman Mao Zedong, who not only assisted us with their blood in the liberation war to defend the freedom and independence of our motherland, but also continue to provide tremendous material and spiritual help after the war.

The Korean people will never forget the sincere assistance of the people of all fraternal countries, and firmly remember that noble proletarian internationalism is the guarantee of our eternal victory.

After the armistice in Korea, the Korean people consolidated the armistice, restored and developed the people's economy that had been brutally destroyed by the war, and embarked on the road to strengthening the material foundation for the unification of the motherland—the revolutionary democratic base.

The Korean people are concentrating their patriotic enthusiasm to restore and build their motherland more beautifully and prosperously, and to achieve its peaceful unification as soon as possible, on the victorious implementation of the three-year plan for the restoration and development of the people's economy after the war. Eliminating the colonial imbalance in our country's industry in the three-year plan is of great significance. Therefore, in the two years since the armistice, more than 60 large and medium-sized industrial enterprises, such as the Heechon Machine Tool Factory, have been newly built and have begun production. At the same time, more than 230 industrial enterprises, such as the Supung Power Plant, have been fully or partially restored and expanded, and have also been put into production one after another.

In the first half of 1955, the total output value of state-owned and cooperative industries reached 250 percent of that in the first half of 1953. The heavy industry sector, the backbone of industry, produced many new products such as new-type lathes.

In order to rapidly improve the living standards of the people who had suffered from the war, the Korean Workers' Party and the government paid special attention to the production of means of livelihood. As a result, taking the production of cotton fabrics in the first half of 1955 as an example, it has reached 200 percent of the total production in the pre-war year of 1949; the output of silk fabrics in the first half of this year reached 400 percent of that in the first half of 1953.

Due to the correct policy adopted by our government towards the countryside, and due to the enthusiasm of the peasant masses, remarkable achievements have also been made in agriculture in the two years since the armistice. In the two years since the armistice, tens of thousands of chongbo of planting area have been restored and expanded; 51 reservoirs, 334 kilometers of dikes, and 570 pumping stations have been newly built and repaired, and the irrigated area has been expanded by 38,000 chongbo.

As of the end of June 1955, the number of agricultural production cooperatives formed according to the voluntary principle of farmers has reached 11,529. These agricultural production cooperatives have included 44 percent of all peasant households and 42 percent of the total planting area.

The planting area in the first half of 1955 has increased by 22,500 chongbo compared with the first half of 1953.

In the two years since the armistice, the people have gained great benefits through four price reductions.

The average monetary wage of workers and staff in the first half of 1955 has increased by 31 percent compared with the first half of 1953, and the actual wage has reached 200 percent.

At present, our country has opened 3,604 elementary schools, 1,250 junior and senior high schools, 72 secondary technical schools, and 16 universities. These schools have more than 1.83 million students. From the 1956 academic year, a comprehensive system of compulsory elementary education will be implemented.

In the two years since the armistice, healthcare facilities have also been further developed. At present, our country has 276 hospitals and 134 clinics. In the past two years, the number of doctors in medical institutions has increased by 49 percent. People's art has also had a rapid recovery and development after the war.

Now our people are striving to complete the three-year plan ahead of schedule and exceed the target.

Looking at the ever-renewing urban and rural development, and believing in a happier tomorrow and a more progressive society, our people are advancing towards new victories.

However, the Korean people are welcoming the 10th anniversary of liberation in a situation where their most urgent wish—the unification of the motherland—has not yet been realized. This situation is caused by the national division policy and territorial division policy of American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique. Obviously, the American politicians and the Syngman Rhee bandits have no sincerity in the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

At the Geneva Conference last year, the delegation of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea put forward a plan for holding general elections for the National Assembly to establish a unified Korean government and for the withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from Korea. However, due to the unreasonable attitude of the delegation of the US government and the representatives of the Syngman Rhee puppet group, the Geneva Conference failed to reach any agreement on the peaceful unification of Korea.

Subsequently, the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea proposed a series of plans related to the peaceful unification of Korea in order to achieve the peaceful unification of Korea, namely, holding a joint conference of political parties, social organizations and the National Assembly of North and South Korea, economic and cultural exchanges between North and South Korea, withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, holding an international conference of countries concerned for the unification of Korea, and reducing the number of troops in North and South Korea to 100,000, respectively, but these legitimate proposals were either obliterated or unreasonably rejected.

Before the American government's signature on the Korean Armistice Agreement was dry, it signed the "Mutual Defense Treaty" and "Military and Economic Assistance Agreement" with the Syngman Rhee bandits. Under their direct command, the number of Syngman Rhee puppet troops is now more than double that during the armistice period, and the Syngman Rhee bandits are almost daily clamoring for "northern unification," repeatedly creating incidents that violate the armistice agreement, and attempting to dissolve the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which is responsible for supervising the Korean armistice.

Due to the Syngman Rhee bandits' policy of preparing for war, the economy of the southern half has become militarized, and the people are wandering in unemployment, poverty, and hunger.

Regarding the so-called "assistance" of the United States to South Korea, although it is highly touted, as a result of the so-called "assistance," South Korea's industrial production is only 20 percent of the pre-liberation level; agriculture in South Korea, the main agricultural area of our country, has also been severely damaged. Taking 1954 as an example, the planting area was reduced by more than 40,000 chongbo compared with 1953. The food shortage in 1953 was 510,000 tons, and in 1954 it was more than 650,000 tons. In addition to bearing 80 percent of the total tax amount of the Syngman Rhee government, South Korean farmers bear as many as 280 kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies. According to the Syngman Rhee government's public data, there are now more than 2 million fully unemployed people in South Korea, more than 1 million wandering peasants and peasants without food, and millions of semi-unemployed people and bankrupt urban petty citizens. The people in the southern half are completely deprived of democratic rights and freedoms and live under a system of terror and slaughter. But they will never give in. Encouraged by the political, economic, and cultural achievements in the northern half of our country, the patriotic struggle for the complete independence and unification of the motherland is rising day by day.

Today, the extremely important task facing the Korean people is to launch a tenacious struggle for the early realization of the peaceful unification of the motherland. In order to realize this task, all the patriotic and democratic forces in Korea are tightly united around our republic government.

The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea continues to make efforts for the peaceful unification of Korea. The Korean people believe that the Korean issue is an issue that belongs to the Korean people themselves, and they are deeply convinced that they can peacefully resolve this issue. This is the indestructible will of all the Korean people. The peaceful settlement of the Korean issue is not only in line with the interests of the Korean people themselves, but also fully in line with the interests of peace in the Far East and world peace.

The Korean people are not isolated in the struggle for the peaceful unification of their motherland, and have strong peace-loving friends all over the world.

The great Soviet Union gives sincere support and solidarity to the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful unification of the motherland. The Soviet Union has consistently supported the legitimate demands of the Korean people on the international stage. This policy of the Soviet Union has been warmly welcomed by the Korean people.

Our struggle for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue has received full support from the People's Republic of China. At the Geneva Conference last year, the delegation of the government of the People's Republic of China made sincere efforts for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and subsequently continued to advocate holding a conference of countries concerned on the Korean issue to support our position.

The fact that the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers has withdrawn thirteen divisions from Korea twice is another contribution to the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

Recently, the international tension has been significantly eased. The achievements of the Asian-African Conference, the talks between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, the signing of the Austrian State Treaty, and the summit conference of the four major powers show that international issues can be resolved peacefully through consultation. This further shows that the outstanding Korean issue can and must be resolved peacefully.

At just such a time, Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, once again emphasized the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China. This is of great significance in the current situation where Asian countries are proposing to hold a Far East conference. This once again proves the Chinese government's sincere efforts for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

The Korean people are very proud to have such powerful and close neighbors as the great Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. The Korean people have always strived to consolidate peace, oppose wars of aggression, and develop friendly cooperation among the people of all countries.

The Korean people are watching with infinite joy the great achievements made by the Chinese people in the political, economic, cultural and other aspects of the People's Republic of China, which is marching bravely toward socialism.

Our people express their active support for the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China have formed an unbreakable unity, and we are convinced that the historical bond of friendship and unity between the people of the two countries will be further consolidated, and the consolidation of the friendship and unity between the people of the two countries will further strengthen the forces of the peace and democracy camp.

Long live the eternal friendship and unity of the people of Korea and China!

Long live our liberator, the strong bulwark of world peace, the great Soviet Union!

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people and the close friend of the Korean people!

Long live world peace!

### 朝鲜驻中国大使崔一的讲话

专栏：

    朝鲜驻中国大使崔一的讲话尊敬的主席同志！亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    朝鲜人民今天庆祝由于伟大的苏联军队从日本帝国主义的长期统治羁绊下，获得解放的“八·一五”十周年纪念。
    首先，请允许我向朝鲜人民的解放者，真诚的援助者——伟大的苏联及其武装力量——苏联军队，致以衷心的感谢和热烈的祝贺。
    自从日本帝国主义殖民地统治羁绊下获得解放的那一天起，在朝鲜人民面前，打开了走向自由独立和民主主义的广阔道路，在朝鲜历史上开始了新的一页。
    但是，由于美帝国主义在我国南半部破坏了第二次世界大战中同盟国之间的协约和莫斯科三外长会议的决定，到今天为止，民主主义的发展，只能在我们祖国的北半部获得实现。
    朝鲜人民的领导力量——朝鲜劳动党，组织了以工农联盟为基础的民主主义统一战线，在共和国北半部利用苏联军队所造成的有利条件，为创建统一我国的强有力的基础——革命民主基地而动员了一切民主力量。
    人民政权在广大人民群众的积极支持下，进行了政治、经济、文化各方面的巨大民主改革。
    由于实行了土地改革，把日本帝国主义者和地主的土地无偿地分配给广大的农民，农民便成为土地的真正主人。落后的我国农村在经济上文化上的逐渐得到发展，建立了工农联盟的巩固基础。
    又由于没收了日本帝国主义和亲日派民族叛徒的产业，使铁路、运输、邮电、银行等成为全民所有，人民掌握了经济命脉，准备了我国工业化的条件。
    实施了民主主义的劳动法令，男女平等权法令，保障了工人、职员、妇女的民主权利，并实施了农业实物税法令，废除了农民的苛捐杂税。
    教育、文化、保健工作也在飞跃地发展着。在教育方面实施了民主化政策，大大地扩大了各级学校和教育机关，给广大劳动人民的子女打开了就学的大门。在朝鲜劳动党和政府的深厚关怀下，我国的民族文化艺术也获得了发展。朝鲜人民并于一九四八年二月创建了自己英勇的武装力量——朝鲜人民军。这在建立自主独立国家的斗争中是一个划时代的事件。
    然而我国的南半部走上了完全相反的道路。代替日本帝国主义侵占南半部的美帝国主义，纠合朝鲜人民的仇敌——地主、买办资本家、亲日派、亲美派、民族叛徒等，在南半部建立了残酷的法西斯警察恐怖制度。
    美帝国主义者把我国的南半部变为它的殖民地，从事推销商品并掠夺原料，并在一九四八年五月竟制造了李承晚傀儡政权，直接和公开地分裂了朝鲜。
    全体朝鲜人民为统一祖国和国土完整，反对美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚傀儡集团的民族分裂政策和国土两断，而掀起了正义斗争，在一九四八年九月创建了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的成立，在朝鲜人民建设独立自主国家的斗争史上写下了灿烂的一页。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国是在以坚强的工农联盟为基础的一切反帝反封建阶层的统一战线上建立起来的，在它的周围团结了广大的爱国的民主力量。这样，在我国的北半部解放后不到五年的短短的时间内，创建了统一祖国的强有力的物质基础——革命的民主基地。在我国北半部进行和平建设的五年，是朝鲜历史上最幸福的黄金时代。
    但是，我国人民庄严的和平建设，由于美帝国主义者和李承晚卖国集团所发动的侵略战争，不得不一时中断，全体朝鲜人民实现和平统一祖国的愿望也不能及早实现了。
    战争是对年青的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的社会政治制度和我们人民的物质、精神以及军事力量的严重考验。我国人民在朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府以及敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的领导下，光荣地经受这一严重的考验，同夸耀为“世界最强”的美国军队及其仆从国家的军队，进行三年多的残酷战争，获得了辉煌的胜利。
    这一胜利就是我国人民民主制度的不可战胜的生活力的示威，也就是不愿作帝国主义奴隶的我国人民的高尚的政治、道德品质、团结力量和不屈的坚强意志的示威。
    我们的这一胜利，是同以伟大的苏联为首的中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家人民以及全世界爱好和平人民的国际主义的支持与援助分不开的。
    伟大的中国人民高举着抗美援朝的旗帜，为援助朝鲜人民展开了全民性的运动，给朝鲜人民以物质上和精神上莫大援助。特别是在祖国解放战争中我们处于最艰苦的时期，派遣了人民志愿军到朝鲜前线以鲜血援助了我们。
    我借此机会以全体朝鲜人民和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的名义，向不仅在保卫我们祖国自由独立的解放战争中以鲜血援助了我们，而且在战后继续不断地从物质上、精神上给予莫大帮助的伟大的中国人民和中华人民共和国政府及其领袖毛泽东主席表示衷心的感谢。
    朝鲜人民永不忘记各兄弟国家人民诚心诚意的援助，并且牢牢地记住高尚的无产阶级国际主义是我们永远胜利的保障。
    在朝鲜实现停战后，朝鲜人民巩固停战，同时恢复发展因战争遭到残酷破坏的人民经济，并走上了为加强统一祖国的物质基础——革命民主基地的道路。
    朝鲜人民将自己的祖国恢复建设得更加美丽，更加富强，并使其早日和平统一的爱国热诚，正集中于胜利地执行战后人民经济恢复发展的三年计划上。三年计划中消除我国工业上殖民地的不平衡性是具有重要意义的。因此，在停战后两年期间，新建了熙川机器制造工厂等六十多个大中工业企业，并开始了生产。同时，水丰发电厂等二百三十多个工业企业已全部或部分地得到恢复和扩大，也先后投入了生产。
    一九五五年上半年，国营及合作社工业的总产值达到一九五三年上半年的百分之二百五十。工业骨干的重工业部门，生产了新型车床等许多新产品。
    朝鲜劳动党和政府，为了迅速提高曾在战争中遭到灾难的人民生活水平，特别注意到生活资料的生产。结果，只以一九五五年上半年棉织品生产量为例，已达到战前——一九四九年全年生产量的百分之二百；丝织品的产量，今年上半年达到一九五三年上半年的百分之四百。
    由于我国政府对农村所采取的正确政策，由于农民群众的热诚，停战后两年期间，在农业方面也收到了显著的成就。停战后两年来，已恢复和扩大了数万町步的播种面积；新建和修建了五十一处水库、三百三十四公里的堤坝、五百七十处扬水场，灌溉面积已扩大了三万八千町步。
    根据农民的自愿原则所组成的农业生产合作社的数目，截至一九五五年六月底为止，已有一万一千五百二十九个。而在这些农业生产合作社里已包括了全部农户的百分之四十四，全部播种面积的百分之四十二。
    一九五五年上半年的播种面积，比一九五三年上半年已增长了二万二千五百町步。
    停战后二年来，经过四次降低物价，人民得到了巨大的利益。
    职工的本均货币工资，一九五五年上半年比一九五三年上半年已增加了百分之三十一，实际工资则达到了百分之二百。
    目前我国已开办了三千六百零四所小学、一千二百五十所初级及高级中学、七十二所中等技术学校、十六所大学。在这些学校里，拥有一百八十三万多个学生。从一九五六年度开始全面地实行初等义务教育制。
    停战后两年来，卫生设施也获得了进一步的发展。目前，在我国已有二百七十六个医院、一百三十四个诊疗所。两年来，医疗机关的医师，增加了百分之四十九。战后人民艺术，也有了迅速的恢复和发展。
    现在我国人民正在为提前和超额完成三年计划而奋斗。
    我国人民，眼看着日益更新的城市和农村的发展面貌，并确信更幸福的明天和更进步的社会，向着新的胜利前进。
    然而，朝鲜人民是在尚未实现自己极迫切的愿望——祖国统一的情况下，迎接解放十周年的。而这种情况是由于美帝国主义者和李承晚卖国集团的民族分裂政策和国土分割政策所造成的。显然，美国的政客和李承晚匪帮们，对朝鲜问题的和平解决是毫无诚意的。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团去年在日内瓦会议上，提出了关于建立朝鲜统一政府的国会总选举和一切外国武装力量撤出朝鲜的方案。但是，由于美国政府代表团和李承晚傀儡集团代表的横暴无理的态度，日内瓦会议对朝鲜的和平统一问题，没有能够达成任何协议。
    随后，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议为了朝鲜的和平统一，提出了有关和平统一朝鲜的一系列方案，即关于召开南北朝鲜的各政党、社会团体及国会的联合会议。关于南北朝鲜间的经济及文化交流、关于一切外国军队撤出朝鲜、关于召开为统一朝鲜的有关国家的国际性会议、关于南北朝鲜军队的数目各减到十万人等问题，但是这些正当的建议，不是被抹煞，就是被横暴地拒绝了。
    美国政府在他们在朝鲜停战协定上签字的笔迹尚未干掉之前，就同李承晚匪帮签订了“共同防御条约”和“军事经济援助协定”。在他们的直接指挥下，现在李承晚傀儡军队的数目比停战时期已增加了一倍以上，李承晚匪帮几乎每天大肆叫嚣“北进统一”，接连制造违反停战协定的事件，并企图解散负责监督朝鲜停战的中立国监察委员会。
    由于李承晚匪帮的备战政策，南半部经济已趋向军事化，人民在失业、贫穷和饥饿中彷徨着。
    关于美国对南朝鲜的所谓“援助”，虽然大吹而特吹，但是由于所谓“援助”的结果，南朝鲜的工业生产额仅有解放前水平的百分之二十；我国主要农产区南朝鲜的农业，也遭到严重破坏。只以一九五四年度为例，播种面积比一九五三年缩减了四万多町步。一九五三年度粮食缺乏达五十一万吨、一九五四年度达六十五万多吨。南朝鲜农民除担负李承晚政府全部税额的百分之八十外，担负的苛捐杂税竟达二百八十种。只根据李承晚政府的公开资料，现在南朝鲜有二百万以上的完全失业者，一百万以上的流浪农民和绝粮的农民，另有数百万的半失业者和破产的城市小市民。南半部人民完全被剥夺了民主权利和自由，并在恐怖、虐杀制度下生活着。但是他们绝不屈服。他们被我国北半部取得的政治、经济、文化上的成就所鼓舞，为祖国完全自主统一独立的爱国斗争在逐日高涨中。
    今天，摆在朝鲜人民面前的极其重要的任务，就是为早日实现祖国的和平统一展开顽强的斗争。为实现此项任务，现在朝鲜的一切爱国民主力量，紧紧地团结在我们共和国政府的周围。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府，为了朝鲜的和平统一继续做出努力。朝鲜人民认为：朝鲜问题是属于朝鲜人民本身的问题，他们深信能够和平解决这一问题。这就是全朝鲜人民不可摧毁的意志。朝鲜问题的和平解决，不仅是符合于朝鲜人民本身的利益，而且也完全符合于远东和平以及世界和平的利益。
    朝鲜人民在为和平统一自己祖国的斗争中并不孤立，有着强有力的全世界爱好和平的朋友。
    伟大的苏联在朝鲜人民为和平统一祖国的斗争中给予诚意的支持和声援。苏联在国际舞台上，始终如一地支持了朝鲜人民的正当要求。苏联的这一政策，受到了朝鲜人民的热烈欢迎。
    我们为和平解决朝鲜问题的斗争，受到了中华人民共和国充分的支持。在去年的日内瓦会议上，中华人民共和国政府代表团为了朝鲜问题的和平解决，作了真挚的努力，随后继续主张召开关于朝鲜问题的有关国家的会议，以支持我们的立场。
    中国人民志愿军司令部，经两次将十三个师从朝鲜撤出这一事实，在和平解决朝鲜问题上又是一个贡献。
    最近国际紧张局势，有了显著的缓和，亚非会议、苏联和南斯拉夫的会谈、奥地利国家条约的签订、四大国政府首脑会议等的成就，显示了国际问题可以用协商方式和平解决。这又说明，悬而未决的朝鲜问题，也可以而且一定要用和平方式解决。
    正当这样一个时期，中华人民共和国国务院总理兼外交部长周恩来同志在中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上，再一次地强调了和平解决朝鲜问题。这在目前亚洲各国正提议召开远东会议的情况下，是具有重大意义的。这在和平解决朝鲜问题上又一次证明了中国政府诚意的努力。
    朝鲜人民以有了伟大的苏联和中华人民共和国这样强大的、亲密的邻邦引为很大的骄傲。朝鲜人民一向努力于巩固和平、反对侵略战争、发展各国人民间的友好合作。
    朝鲜人民以无限的欢欣，注视着向社会主义勇往直前的中国人民在政治、经济、文化等各方面所取得的重大成就。
    我国人民对中国人民为解放台湾的斗争表示积极的支持。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国已形成牢不可破的团结，我们确信：朝中两国人民间所结成的历史性友谊团结的纽带将会更加巩固，两国人民友谊团结的巩固将会进一步加强和平民主阵营的力量。
    朝中两国人民的永恒的友谊团结万岁！
    我们的解放者、世界和平的强有力的堡垒、伟大的苏联万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖、朝鲜人民亲密的朋友毛泽东主席万岁！
    世界和平万岁！　　　　　（新华社）
