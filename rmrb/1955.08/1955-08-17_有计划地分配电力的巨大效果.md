    The Great Effect of Planned Allocation of Electricity
    Peng Zili
    Since the spring of this year, Shanghai has been piloting the planned allocation of electricity. After the first batch of 96 factories began the trial, the unit electricity consumption generally decreased by 3% to 22%, with an average decrease of 6.8%. This can save more than 40 million kilowatt-hours of electricity throughout the year, equivalent to adding an 8,000 kilowatt power generation unit, saving the state 8.8 million yuan in basic construction investment. This electricity can be used to produce 230,000 pieces of 20-count yarn or supply electric furnace steelmaking for more than 57,000 tons.
    The planned allocation of electricity has promoted the improvement of production management in electricity-consuming enterprises. For example, after the electricity plan indicators were issued to the workshops of Printing and Dyeing Factory No. 1, it was found that the night shift used 50 more kilowatt-hours of electricity than the day shift. Later, after understanding and analysis, it turned out that the night shift oilers were sleeping on the job and did not add oil in time, which made the machine run poorly and increased electricity consumption. Since then, not only has the waste of electricity been overcome, but also the maintenance of machinery and labor discipline have been strengthened. After installing a pressure headbox, Jiangnan Paper Mill reduced its unit electricity consumption by 20%. Due to the increased speed of the vehicle, the output per unit time increased by 32%. The unit electricity consumption for electrolytic copper in the Shanghai Smelting Plant had never met the national standard since liberation. After the planned allocation of electricity in May, the target was met for the first time. It is estimated that the first batch of 96 factories and enterprises piloting the electricity plan allocation can pay 3.2 million yuan less in electricity bills throughout the year, which relatively reduces the product cost.
    An important link in the smooth implementation of the electricity plan allocation work is to strengthen the quota management of electricity in factories and enterprises and formulate advanced electricity consumption quotas. In order to reduce the electricity consumption quota of products, the first batch of factories and enterprises in Shanghai that piloted the electricity plan allocation actively mobilized the masses to tap potential, formulate technical measures to save electricity, and established a strict electricity management system.
    The effect of the electricity allocation pilot program in Shanghai proves that the potential for saving electricity is great. In 1954, Shanghai saved 48 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. This year, the first batch of factories and enterprises piloting the electricity allocation saved more than 40 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. After completing the electricity allocation for the second batch of factories and enterprises, it is estimated that more than 20 million kilowatt-hours of electricity can be saved again. If electricity systems across the country can learn from Shanghai's experience, implement regional electricity allocation in a planned manner, and calculate the proportion of electricity savings after Shanghai's electricity plan allocation, the country can save more than 600 million kilowatt-hours of electricity in one year, equivalent to increasing equipment capacity of 100,000 kilowatts, which can save the state a huge amount of basic construction investment.

    有计划地分配电力的巨大效果
    彭自励
    上海市从今年春季开始试行有计划地分配电力，在第一批九十六个工厂试行以后，单位电消耗量普遍降低了百分之三至百分之二十二，平均降低百分之六点八，全年可节约电力四千多万度，相当于增加了一个八千瓩的发电设备，等于给国家节省基本建设投资八百八十万元，用这些电力可生产二十支纱二十三万件或供给电炉炼钢五万七千多吨。
    有计划地分配电力，促进用电企业改善了生产管理。如印染一厂在用电计划指标下达车间后，发现夜班比日班多用五十度电，后来了解分析，原来是夜班加油工人在班上睡觉，没有及时加油，因而使机器旋转不灵，增加了用电量。从此，不仅克服了电力的浪费，而且加强了机器保养和劳动纪律。江南造纸厂安装压力流浆箱后，使单位电消耗量降低了百分之二十，由于加快了车速，单位时间产量提高了百分之三十二。上海冶炼厂电解铜的单位电消耗量，解放后一直没有完成过国家规定的指标，五月份有计划地分配电力以后，第一次完成了指标。据估计，第一批试行电力计划分配的九十六个工厂企业，全年可以少缴电费三百二十万元，这就相对地降低了产品成本。
    顺利实行电力计划分配工作的重要环节是加强工厂企业对电力的定额管理，制定先进的电量消耗定额。上海市第一批试行电力计划分配的工厂企业，为了降低产品的电量消耗定额，纷纷发动群众挖掘潜力，订出节约用电的技术措施，并建立了严格的用电管理制度。
    上海市试行电力分配的效果证明，节约用电的潜力是很大的。一九五四年，全上海市节约用电四千八百万度，今年第一批试行电力分配的工厂企业又节约了四千多万度电，在完成第二批工厂企业的电力分配以后，估计还可以再节约电力二千多万度。如果全国各地电力系统能吸取上海市的经验，有计划地实行地区电力分配，按上海市电力计划分配后节约用电的比例计算，全国一年内可以节约电力六亿多度，相当于增加十万瓩的设备容量，可以为国家节省一笔巨大的基本建设投资。
