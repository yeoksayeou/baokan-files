    Relief Work in Minority Areas Over the Past Two Years
    Miu Hongchang
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have always regarded helping ethnic minorities develop their economies and cultures as an important task. In the past few years, in addition to helping ethnic minorities improve production technology, develop transportation and trade, and strengthen cultural and health work, the state has also attached importance to providing relief to people in ethnic minority areas who have suffered from natural disasters. In 1953 and 1954 alone, the Ministry of Internal Affairs allocated 15.74 million yuan in relief funds to various ethnic minority areas, focusing on areas inhabited by ethnic minorities in the southwest and northwest. This has played a significant role in solving the production and living difficulties of impoverished households and disaster victims in ethnic minority areas.
    1954 was a year with relatively severe natural disasters nationwide. In ethnic minority areas, the more serious natural disasters that occurred that year included the flood in the Nyang Chu River basin in Tibet, the snow disaster in the Xilin Gol League area of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the snow disaster in the Golog area of Qinghai Province. Both the central and local governments devoted great efforts to the relief work for the people affected by these disasters. After the flood occurred in the Gyantse and Shigatse areas of the Nyang Chu River basin in Tibet, the Central People's Government, in addition to allocating relief funds, also instructed the Tibet region and the local government of Tibet to carry out a series of relief efforts. The central government successively allocated more than 1.25 million yuan in relief funds, and the People's Bank also allocated loans to support wool weaving and other handicraft households to restore production. The trade departments also vigorously purchased local specialties from Tibetan people and supplied the disaster-stricken people with the means of production and means of subsistence needed to overcome the famine, and organized disaster victims to participate in the construction of roads as a form of work relief. Through these many efforts, the disaster victims were able to smoothly overcome the famine. In February and March of the same year, after a severe snow and freezing disaster occurred in the Xilin Gol League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Inner Mongolia Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the People's Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region immediately dispatched a large number of cadres to the disaster areas to assist in the work, and mobilized the Chahar League and the Zhaowuda League to provide strong support. Each affected banner established a disaster resistance and livestock protection command to lead the masses to take measures such as breaking snow, feeding, building sheds, moving fields, night watch, and mutual assistance among the masses to protect livestock. In order to solve the problem of livestock feed in a timely manner, in addition to dispatching a large number of vehicles for support, the central government also sent planes to airdrop 18,000 kilograms of grain and feed. The border defense troops of the Chahar League and the Zhaowuda League also allocated 785,000 jin of grain to supply the affected herdsmen. From September to December 1954, the Golog area of Qinghai Province experienced continuous heavy snowfall, which blocked traffic and seriously affected the local people's food and livestock. The central government sent planes to airdrop 100,000 jin of grain, and the Aba area of Sichuan Province used yaks to transport a large amount of grain, which timely solved the problem of food and feed supply in the disaster area. In addition, in the winter of 1953, Guangxi Province allocated 5.14 million pieces of winter clothing and more than 27,000 mosquito nets to impoverished ethnic minority people in mountainous areas. In 1954, Yunnan Province allocated 125,000 sets of winter clothing to impoverished people. Many disaster victims were moved to tears after receiving relief.
    Disaster prevention must come before disaster relief, so all localities also attach great importance to disaster prevention work. In the past few years, ethnic minority areas have made great achievements in water conservancy construction and afforestation. For example, relying on the strength of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, Eshan County repaired a total of 1,303 ponds and dams, 3,220 ditches, opened up 815 water sources, removed sand from 165 places, built 600 water frames, added 258 waterwheels, and added ridges to store water on more than 20,000 mu of land, overcoming the threat of frequent droughts in mountainous areas. Xinjiang Province also carried out locust extermination work by plane with the help of the Soviet government. In 1954, the Soviet government sent 17 planes and locust extermination personnel to Xinjiang to participate in locust extermination, and this year it has sent 8 planes to participate in locust extermination, which has been widely welcomed by people of all ethnic groups. Many areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have learned from the past lessons of snow disasters and have carried out preparations for resisting disasters and protecting livestock. For example, the banners of the Xilin Gol League stored more than 40 million jin of grass last winter, imported more than 2 million jin of various feeds from outside the area, and also made a considerable number of disaster prevention equipment such as pens and felt enclosures, and helped and mobilized herdsmen to move to "Aotuer" (pasture). Therefore, although there were seven or eight blizzards this year, the losses were small.
    In addition to paying attention to the relief of natural disasters in ethnic minority areas, all localities have also distributed a large number of agricultural tools and production subsidies to help ethnic minorities improve production and enhance the disaster resistance capabilities of ethnic minority people. The ethnic minorities, with a population of about 8 million, who live in concentrated or mixed communities in the mountainous areas of the southwestern provinces, mostly engage in "slash-and-burn cultivation," "extensive planting with low yields," and "shifting cultivation." In order to help them change this backward situation and increase grain production, the state distributed various iron agricultural tools worth a total of 7.88 million yuan free of charge in 1953 and 1954, which greatly increased the enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups for production. In Gaoqing Township, Liping County, Guizhou Province, after the free distribution of agricultural tools, the number of households using cattle to plow fields increased from 38 to 95. The Dong and Miao farmers in Huamin Township were very excited after receiving agricultural tools. Some wrote on the rakes: "I love Chairman Mao and will never forget him." After the distribution of agricultural tools in Qibaishi Long Township, Du'an County, Guangxi, 424 mu of wasteland was reclaimed, expanding the cultivated area. In Ashile Village, Hahaha Yi Ethnic Township, Mianning County, Xikang, in the past, few people weeded, accumulated fertilizer, or applied fertilizer in production. Now, they generally weed twice and apply fertilizer three times, so yields have increased year after year. Chihazi, a Yi farmer, harvested eight dou of corn from one dou of land in 1952, one shi and five dou in 1953, and three shi last year. Due to the increase in production, the original impoverished appearance of the whole village has been changed. At the second ethnic minority representative meeting held in the county, at the suggestion of the representative of the village, "Abile Village" (Yi language: meaning dilapidated) was changed to "Ashile Village" (meaning new and good).
    In the past few years, due to the development of production in ethnic minority areas and the vigorous relief and assistance from the government, the ethnic minority people who have suffered from natural disasters have safely overcome the famine. In Fulangpeng Village, Eshan County, the average per capita consumption of rice was 125 jin in 1952 and 183 jin in 1954. The farmers in Yitaide Village, who used to eat ten baskets of "Nian Zhazha" (corn husks) to survive the famine months, now all have enough food. According to a survey in Longse Township, Pingliang County, Guangxi Province, 98 percent of households in the township now have one or several quilts, and 73 percent of households have mosquito nets. People who have received relief are automatically reclaiming wasteland and working hard to produce. They said: "We would be letting Chairman Mao down if we didn't produce well."

    两年来少数民族地区的救济工作
    缪鸿昌
    中华人民共和国成立之后，中国共产党和人民政府一直把帮助少数民族发展经济和文化作为自己的重要任务。几年来，国家除了帮助少数民族改进生产技术，发展交通、贸易事业，加强文化、卫生工作外，还重视了对少数民族地区遭受自然灾害的人民进行救济工作。仅一九五三和一九五四年两年，内务部分配给各少数民族地区的救济款即达一千五百七十四万元，重点用于西南、西北的少数民族聚居地区，这对于解决少数民族地区的贫困户和灾民的生产、生活困难，起了很大的作用。
    一九五四年是全国自然灾害较重的一年。在少数民族地区，这一年比较严重的自然灾害有：西藏年楚河流域的水灾，内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒盟地区的雪灾、青海省果洛地区的雪灾等。对于这些地区受灾人民的救济工作，中央和地方政府都投入极大力量。西藏年楚河流域江孜、日喀则地区发生水灾后，中央人民政府除拨款救济外，并指示西藏地区和西藏地方政府进行一系列的救济工作。中央先后拨出救济款一百二十五万余元，人民银行并拨出贷款扶持织氆等手工业户恢复生产。贸易部门也大力收购藏民的土特产，供应受灾人民在渡荒中所需要的生产资料和生活资料，并组织灾民参加修建公路，以工代赈。通过这许多工作，使灾民顺利地渡过灾荒。同年二、三月间，内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒盟发生严重的雪冻灾害之后，中共中央内蒙古分局和内蒙古自治区人民委员会即派出大批干部到灾区协助工作，并动员察哈尔盟、昭乌达盟大力支援，受灾各旗成立了抗灾保畜指挥部，领导群众采取破雪、喂料、搭棚、移场以及打更下夜、群众互助等办法，保护牲畜。为了及时解决牲畜饲料问题，中央除调派大批车辆支援外，并派飞机空投粮食、饲料一万八千公斤。察哈尔盟、昭乌达盟的边防部队也调拨出七十八万五千斤粮食，供给受灾牧民。青海省果洛地区一九五四年九月至十二月连降大雪，交通被阻，严重地影响了当地的民食、畜用；中央派飞机空投粮食十万斤，并由四川阿坝地区利用毛牛等运进大批粮食，及时地解决了灾区粮食、饲料的供应问题。此外，广西省一九五三年冬曾拨给贫苦山区少数民族人民寒衣五百十四万件，蚊帐二万七千多床。云南省一九五四年曾拨给贫苦人民寒衣十二万五千套。不少灾民在获得救济之后，感动得流下泪来。
    救灾必先防灾，因此各地对于防灾工作也很重视。几年来，少数民族地区在兴修水利、植树造林工作方面，已有很大成绩。如峨山县依靠互助合作组织的力量，一九五四年全县共整修了塘坝一千三百零三座、水沟三千二百二十条，开辟水源八百十五股，淘走沙水一百六十五处，支打水架六百处，添制水车二百五十八张，加埂积水二万多亩，战胜了山区常有的旱灾威胁。新疆省并在苏联政府帮助之下用飞机进行灭蝗工作。一九五四年苏联政府派出十七架飞机和灭蝗人员组成灭蝗团到新疆参加灭蝗，今年又已派出飞机八架参加灭蝗，受到各族人民的普遍欢迎。内蒙古自治区许多地区接受了过去遭受雪灾的教训，进行了抗灾保畜的准备工作。如锡林郭勒盟各旗去冬贮草达四千多万斤，由外区输入各种饲料二百多万斤，另外还做了相当数量的圈棚、围毡等防灾设备，并帮助和动员牧民走“敖特尔”（放牧）。因此今年虽又遭七、八次暴风雪灾，但损失很小。
    各地除注意了对少数民族地区的自然灾害的救济外，还发放了大量的农具和生产补助金，以扶助少数民族提高生产，增强少数民族人民的抗灾力量。聚居或杂居在西南各省山区约有八百万人口的少数民族，生产上多是“刀耕火种”，“广种薄收”，“游垦轮歇”。政府为了帮助他们改变这种落后情况，增加粮食生产，一九五三年和一九五四年两年国家就无偿地发放了各种铁质农具，共值七百八十八万元，大大提高了各族人民的生产积极性。贵州省黎平县高青乡，无偿农具发放后，用牛犁田的由三十八户增加到九十五户。化民乡侗族和苗族农民得到了农具后，都非常兴奋，有的在耙上写着：“我爱毛主席，永不忘记他。”广西都安县七百石砻乡发放农具后开荒四百二十四亩，扩大了耕种面积。西康冕宁县哈哈彝族民族乡阿始乐村，过去在生产中很少有人薅草、积肥和施肥，现在一般都薅两次草，施三次肥，因此产量年年增加。彝民赤哈子家一斗玉米地，一九五二年收八斗，一九五三年收一石五斗，去年收了三石。由于生产的提高，改变了全村原来的贫困面貌。在县里召开的第二届少数民族代表会议上，在该村代表的建议下，把“阿比乐村”（彝语：破破烂烂的意思）改为“阿始乐村”（又新又好的意思）。
    几年来，由于少数民族地区生产的发展和政府的大力救济帮助，遭受自然灾害的少数民族人民都安全渡过灾荒。峨山县富良棚村一九五二年平均每人吃大米一百二十五斤，一九五四年平均每人吃到一百八十三斤，依他得村过去一年要吃十背“年渣渣”渡荒月的农民，今年已全部有了足够的口粮。广西省平梁县龙色乡调查，全乡已有百分之九十八的户有了一床至几床被子，百分之七十三的户有了蚊帐。得到救济的人都自动开荒，努力生产。他们说：不好好生产就对不起毛主席。
