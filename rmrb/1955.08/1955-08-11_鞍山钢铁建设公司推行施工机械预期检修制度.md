    Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company has achieved good results since it began implementing the predictive maintenance system for construction machinery in 1954. Now, every machine has a planned predictive maintenance schedule. These schedules are based on the wear patterns of machine parts, and the vast majority can be maintained and serviced according to the planned predictive maintenance schedule. This has extended the service life of the machinery and reduced the incidence of temporary mechanical failures and accidents during operation. Taking excavators as an example, they now average 3,347 operating hours before requiring a major overhaul. Furthermore, the Anshan Iron and Steel Mechanization Station had 34 mechanical accidents in the first half of this year, a decrease of 117 compared to the same period in 1954. The Anshan Iron and Steel Mechanical Installation Company had no mechanical accidents in the first half of this year. (Feng Shiming)

    鞍山钢铁建设公司推行施工机械预期检修制度
    鞍山钢铁建设公司从一九五四年开始推行施工机械预期检修制度以来，收到了良好效果。现在每台机械都有了预期检修的计划，这些计划都是根据机械零件磨损规律制定的，绝大部分也都能按照预期检修计划进行检修和保养。这样就延长了机械的使用时间，减少了在工作中临时发生的机械故障和事故。以挖土机为例，现在平均使用三千三百四十七台时还不需要大修。又如鞍钢机械化站今年上半年发生机械事故三十四件，比一九五四年同时期减少了一百一十七件，鞍钢机械安装公司今年上半年没有发生过机械事故。　（冯世明）
