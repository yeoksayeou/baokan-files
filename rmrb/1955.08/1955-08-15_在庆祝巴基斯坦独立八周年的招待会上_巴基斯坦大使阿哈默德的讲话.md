Your Excellency, friends:

    I thank you all, not only on behalf of my wife and myself, but also on behalf of the nearly 80 million people of Pakistan, for joining us tonight in celebrating the eighth anniversary of our country's independence. Your presence is a great honor and a heartfelt comfort to us, reminding us of the fact that the love of freedom and independence knows no political or national boundaries; that people from various political and social systems can come together as members of the international family to jointly and joyfully celebrate its anniversary of independence. This not only proves that humanity's love of freedom is universal, but also marks the growth of internationalism and the desire of all peoples to live together in friendship and peaceful cooperation.

    August 14 is a momentous day in the history of our people. Although the name Pakistan is only eight years old, the people in our corner of the world have a very ancient culture that existed almost since prehistoric times. On the eve of liberation, the young Pakistani nation faced an almost impossible task. For example, it was necessary to establish administrative institutions, deal with the aftermath of refugees, build a new capital, and so on, and we had to start empty-handed. In the process of building a brand-new country, the eighth year is worth special mention. It was in that year that the country made rapid progress, and the fruits of previous years' efforts began to be harvested. That year was a remarkable year of transition from a purely agricultural country to a semi-industrialized one. I don't want to bother you with facts and figures, but simply offer this sentence: In these eight years, we have changed from a country that produces raw materials to a country that needs to find markets for industrial finished products.

    In international affairs, this year is equally important. The Pakistani government has strengthened its activities to seek a way of life based on the principles of justice and equality, so that all countries in the world can live in peace. We actively initiated the Asian-African Conference. The long-term impact of this conference can only be vaguely seen at the present stage. One participating country's prime minister aptly and meaningfully described the Asian-African Conference as one of the two most important events of this century, the other being the fusion of nuclear atoms. To concretely express our desire for peace, the Prime Minister of Pakistan put forward seven principles of peace at the Bandung Conference, which were later incorporated into the famous Declaration of Ten Principles.

    This year should also be regarded as a year of frequent exchanges in the history of Sino-Pakistani relations. Not only are Pakistan and China now peacefully bordering each other on the southwestern border without disputes, creating a spirit of good neighborliness between the two peoples, but also there have been constant cultural and commercial exchanges between the ancestors of the Chinese and Pakistani peoples since ancient times. In fact, the rich and ancient civilization of this great country has always been highly respected. For us, China is a country rich in culture and wisdom, and people believe that making a visit to China is equivalent to a religious pilgrimage.

    Pakistan was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with the government of the People's Republic of China, and since then, the development of our relations in political, cultural, and commercial fields has been increasing year by year. The friendship between our two peoples was further strengthened at the Bandung Conference. It was there that the Prime Minister of Pakistan first met the head of the Chinese delegation, His Excellency Premier Zhou Enlai, and held unrestricted, frank talks in an extremely harmonious atmosphere. These meetings will always be seen as the beginning of a new stage of closer cooperation between China and Pakistan.

    Spokespersons within and outside the Pakistani government have firmly advocated that the legitimate status of People's China in the United Nations should be restored.

    In the cultural field, this year is particularly extraordinary. At the invitation of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, a delegation of outstanding women leaders organized by the All Pakistan Women's Association visited China; following this, a Pakistani trade union delegation came to participate in the celebration of the "May Day" International Labor Day. These contacts have strengthened our growing ties of friendship, marking the beginning of a new era of Sino-Pakistani cooperation. As one of the initiators of the Asian-African Conference, Pakistan values the significant role played by the Chinese delegation under the outstanding leadership of Premier Zhou Enlai. The constructive and beneficial attitude adopted by the Chinese delegation made a considerable contribution to the success of the conference, thereby easing the tense situation in the Far East. We further believe that the Chinese government's humanitarian decision to release the American air force personnel is another major measure that helps ease international tensions. We sincerely wish the Chinese government success in its efforts to resolve its problems through friendly consultations.

    We look forward to greater and closer cooperation between our two countries in international affairs, not only for the benefit of our two countries, but also for the greater benefit of all mankind.

    The people of Pakistan have been watching China's gradual prosperity with heartfelt satisfaction and increasing admiration.

    Now, I ask you ladies and gentlemen, to join me in a toast to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China, and to the happiness and prosperity of the great Chinese people.

### 在庆祝巴基斯坦独立八周年的招待会上  巴基斯坦大使阿哈默德的讲话

    在庆祝巴基斯坦独立八周年的招待会上
    巴基斯坦大使阿哈默德的讲话阁下，诸位朋友：
    各位今晚光临和我们一起庆祝我国独立的第八周年，我不仅代表我的夫人和以我个人身份感谢各位，同时还向各位保证，我这衷心的谢意也代表巴基斯坦近八千万人民。各位的光临使我们感到莫大的荣幸和衷心的快慰，使我们想到这样一个事实：对自由和独立的爱好，是没有政治和民族的界限的；来自各种政治和社会制度的人们可以共聚一堂，成为国际大家庭中的一员，一起共同欢乐地庆祝它的独立纪念日。这不仅证明人类的爱好自由是普遍的，也同样标志国际主义和各国人民要在友好和和平合作下相处的愿望的增长。
    在我国人民的历史上，八月十四日是一个重大的日子。虽然巴基斯坦这个名称诞生至今八年，但是在世界上我们这一角的人民却有着几乎是史前就存在的极古老的文化。在解放的前夕，年轻的巴基斯坦国家面临着几乎是无法完成的任务。比如：必须把行政机构建立起来，处理难民的善后工作，建立一个新的都城，等等，而我们不得不赤手空拳地着手。在建立一个崭新的国家的过程中，第八年是值得特别提到的。就是在那一年，国家有了飞快的进展，而往年努力的成果开始得到收获。那一年是把一个完全农业的国家改变成为一个半工业化国家的出色的过渡的一年。我想不用向各位举出事实和数字来打搅诸位，而仅仅提出这样一句话：在这八年中，我们已经从一个生产原料的国家改变为一个要为工业成品寻找市场的国家。
    在国际事务方面，这一年也是同样值得重视的。巴基斯坦政府加强了它为求得一种在正义和平等的原则的基础上生活的办法的活动，以便世界上所有的国家可以和平相处。我们曾积极地发起亚非会议。这个会议对于事件的长远影响，在目前的阶段中，只能朦胧看到。一个参加国的总理曾适当地、意味深长地把亚非会议形容为这一世纪里最重要的两件大事之一，另一件是核子原子的聚变。为了具体地表示我们对和平的愿望，巴基斯坦总理在万隆会议上提出了七项和平原则，后来这七项原则合并在那有名的十项原则宣言里。
    这一年也应当被视为中、巴关系历史上交往频繁的一年，不仅现在巴基斯坦和中国在没有纠纷的西南边界上和平接壤，造成了两国人民间一种善邻友好的精神，而且在中国人民和巴基斯坦人民的祖先间，从极古的时代以来一直就有文化和商业上的不断的交往。事实上，这个伟大国家的丰富的古老文明一直就极受尊敬。对于我们来说，中国是一个富于文化和智慧的国家，人们认为到中国作一次访问等于一次宗教上的朝圣。
    巴基斯坦是最初和中华人民共和国政府建立外交关系的国家之一，从那时起，我们在政治、文化、商业各方面的关系的发展都在与年俱增中。我们两国人民间的友谊在万隆会议上又进一步地加强了。就是在那里，巴基斯坦总理第一次会晤了中国代表团杰出的团长、中国总理周恩来先生阁下，并且在极为融洽的空气中举行了没有拘束的、坦白的会谈。这些晤谈将永远被看作是中、巴间更紧密的合作的新阶段的开始。
    巴基斯坦政府内外的发言人都坚决地主张应当恢复人民中国在联合国的合法地位。
    在文化方面，这一年尤其是不平凡的一年。应中华全国民主妇女联合会的邀请，一个由全巴基斯坦妇女协会所组织的杰出的妇女领袖的代表团访问了中国；继此以后，巴基斯坦工会代表团来参加了“五一”国际劳动节的庆祝。这些接触加强了我们在增长中的友谊联系，标志着中、巴合作的新时代的开始。作为亚非会议发起人之一，巴基斯坦重视周恩来总理的杰出领导下的中国代表团所起的显著作用。中国代表团所采取的有建设性的、有益的态度，对于会议的成就作了可观的贡献，从而缓和了远东的紧张局势。我们更进一步认为中国政府释放美国空军人员的人道决定是有助于缓和国际紧张局势的另一重大措施。我们衷心地祝中国政府在用友好的协商办法解决它的问题的努力中获得成就。
    我们不仅为了我们两国自己的利益，而且也为整个人类的更大利益，期待着我们两国间在国际事务上更大、更紧密的合作。
    巴基斯坦的人民一直怀着衷心的满意和日渐增高的钦佩心情注视着中国的逐步繁荣。
    现在我请诸位女士和先生们，和我一起为中华人民共和国毛泽东主席的健康，为伟大的中国人民的幸福和繁荣而干杯。
