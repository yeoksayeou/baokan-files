Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 24th: According to official gazettes, the Indonesian cabinet decided on the 22nd to establish a special committee to investigate the preparations for the general election and report the results within a week. This committee is chaired by the Minister of the Interior, and its members include the Minister of Justice, the Minister of Information, the Minister of Finance, and the Deputy Minister of Transportation.

According to an Antara News Agency report on the 22nd, Indonesian Prime Minister Burhanuddin Harahap, when talking about the general election issue, emphasized that whether the general election can be held as scheduled depends entirely on the completion of the preparations. He said that an investigation needs to be conducted first.

The previous government of former Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo decided that the election would be held on September 29th. President Sukarno said last week that the first election in Indonesia should not be delayed any longer.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 26th: "Social Messenger" reported on the 25th that Indonesian Interior Minister Sunarjo announced that all preparations for holding the general election have been completed. It is everyone's common responsibility to crush any attempts by any party or faction to postpone the general election.

Sunarjo said that any delay in the date of the general election would not only destabilize the domestic political situation but also cause financial losses to the country. He said that the government has allocated more than 600 million Indonesian rupiahs for the general election. He said that all ballots and candidate lists have been printed and sent to various regions. He also cited the detailed number of ballots and candidate lists sent to various places, as well as the dates on which these ballots and candidate lists were sent out. He said that the argument about possibly postponing the date of the general election is provocative and will reduce people's enthusiasm for the general election.

In other news, according to an Antara News Agency report on the 25th, the chairman of the Indonesian Central Election Committee, Hadikusumo, revealed that the committee held talks with the special committee established by the government to investigate the preparations for the general election on the evening of the 24th. The Central Election Committee pointed out that, in view of the preparations made so far, there is no reason to postpone the general election scheduled for September 29th, although there are still difficulties to be overcome, especially in terms of transportation.

At the same time, according to newspaper reports, some people are carrying out various activities to obstruct the general election. "Indonesian Torch" reported on the 25th that certain political parties are sending representatives to persuade their party branches to demand the postponement of the general election. The newspaper also reported that the boxes containing ballots sent to various parts of West Java were damaged when they arrived, and some items in the boxes were lost.

　　印度尼西亚内政部长宣布普选准备工作完成
　　印度尼西亚一些党派要求如期举行普选
    新华社雅加达二十四日电　据官方公报说，印度尼西亚内阁在二十二日决定成立特别委员会，调查普选的准备情况，并且在一星期内报告结果。这个委员会由内政部长担任主席，委员中包括司法部长、情报部长、财政部长和副交通部长。
    据安塔拉通讯社二十二日报道，印度尼西亚总理伯汉努丁·哈拉哈普在谈到普选问题时强调说，普选是否能按期举行，完全要取决于准备工作的完成情况。他说，首先需要进行调查。
    前总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约政府过去决定选举于九月二十九日举行。苏加诺总统上星期曾说过不要再延迟印度尼西亚的第一次选举。
    新华社雅加达二十六日电　“社会使者报”二十五日报道，印度尼西亚内政部长苏纳里约宣布，举行普选的一切准备工作已经完成。粉碎任何方面或党派推迟普选的任何企图，是大家共同的责任。
    苏纳里约说，普选日期的任何拖延不仅将使国内政局不稳定，并且将使国家遭受财政上的损失。他说，政府已经拨款印度尼西亚币六亿盾以上作为普选的费用。他说，全部选票和候选人名单都已经印好并且送到各地区去了。他还举出送往各地的选票和候选人名单的详细数目，以及送出这些选票和候选人名单的日期。他说，关于可能推迟普选日期的论调是具有挑拨性质的，并且会降低人们对普选的热情。
    又讯　据安塔拉通讯社二十五日报道，印度尼西亚中央选举委员会主席哈迪库苏莫透露，这个委员会在二十四日晚间曾经同政府成立的调查普选准备情况的特别委员会举行会谈。中央选举委员会曾指出，鉴于到现在为止所进行的准备工作，没有理由推迟预定在九月二十九日举行的普选，虽然仍有困难待克服，特别是交通方面的困难。
    同时，据报纸报道，有人正在进行阻挠普选的种种活动。“印度尼西亚火炬报”二十五日说，某些政党正在派遣代表们去劝说它们的党的支部要求推迟普选。这家报纸还报道，运往西爪哇各地的装着选票的箱子在运到时已经破损，并且箱中有些东西遗失了。
