　　These days, in the Longxugou area of Beijing, the residents' conversations often focus on the measures for rationed grain supply. Housewives, in particular, discuss them with great interest. The trial implementation of these measures began here in August.

　　“The method thought up by the People's Government is very good, in my opinion. Supplying rations based on household verification has already given us some benefits, and now supplying rations based on individual classification and quantity will benefit us even more.” When I asked Yu Guirong, a woman living at 11 Moujiajing, about the grain ration supply situation, she affirmed this to me.

　　Yu Guirong's family has a total of three people. Her husband is a worker at the Jingxi Mining Bureau, returning home once or twice a month during his days off. Then there's her father-in-law, a 62-year-old man, who still goes out to haul coal cinders to sell every three to five days. He's healthy and has a considerable appetite. From January to May this year, her family bought an average of 73 jin of grain per month, with a total surplus of about ten jin each month. In June, when grain was supplied based on household verification, her family planned for 62 jin. In July, because her husband was temporarily away for work, the planned verification was 60 jin. Both months, her father-in-law worried about not having enough to eat, but in reality, it was enough. Yu Guirong said: "But whether there was waste or not, in my heart, I was rather muddled." In August, the new measures were announced. According to the standards, she was allocated 28 jin, and her father-in-law was also allocated 28 jin, totaling 56 jin, which is four jin less than in July.

　　“Is it enough to eat?” I asked.

　　Yu Guirong laughed heartily and said, "I am no longer muddled in my heart. I will pay attention to saving where I should save. I have already calculated, and it is enough."

　　“Does your father-in-law have any objections?”

　　"Actually, the old man's old habits are still in his mind." Yu Guirong continued: "In the past, as soon as he had some money, he would tell me to buy grain, always feeling that we should store some. Not long ago, he was still muttering, 'How can we eat all the grain every month!' I told him that there is no need to store grain now. Our People's Government has arranged everything well; there is plenty of grain. We can eat it all every month and then buy more. My husband also explained the reasoning to him. Now, it really is enough to eat, and he has come to understand.”

　　A neighbor, a woman named Niu Sufen, walked over holding a little girl. Hearing that we were talking about rationed grain supply, she joined in the conversation. She told me that she lives at C6 Moujiajing, also a family of three. Her husband works at the Central Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products. With the implementation of rationed grain supply per person, she receives 28 jin, her husband 31 jin, and the child 8 jin, totaling 67 jin. She said: "More than enough to eat." After a pause, she added, "Not only is it enough to eat, but this new method has other benefits."

　　I asked what the benefits of this new method were. Niu Sufen said: "Our monthly income is fixed, and now the amount of grain we eat each month is also fixed, so we can better plan our lives!"

　　"This method teaches us to save grain, no longer wasting it in a muddled way. Saving grain is good for both the country and us individuals." Yu Guirong also interjected, "Now, rationing according to the intensity of work and age is also very reasonable! The People's Government thinks of us working people first."

　　Yu Guirong also said that with the implementation of this new method, the People's Government's planning for grain supply has been further strengthened, which can better guarantee national economic construction and make management more convenient. Niu Sufen continued:

　　"For grain users, it's also easier. In the past, verification was done by household every month, which required a lot of procedures. Now, it's only done once."

　　To understand the situation better, I went to Chen Xiuqing's house at 12 Beitan'gen. Her family is a self-employed shoemaking household with a total of five people. Chen Xiuqing told me that her husband is the main labor force, with a grain ration of 32 jin; she helps her husband with work in addition to housework, receiving 28 jin; her daughter and son in middle school each receive 35 jin; and her son in elementary school receives 28 jin. The five of them total 158 jin. However, during the household-based ration verification in June and July, her family only received 140 jin, so now they have 18 jin more.

　　“What do you do with the extra 18 jin?” I asked.

　　Chen Xiuqing said: "We adjust it to those who have less. We don't need the extra."

　　She went on to explain that if they didn't adjust it to others, it would easily be wasted. Her family had a family meeting about this, and the whole family agreed to give it to others. The children even said that they wanted their mother to cook according to a set plan in the future, not to make too much, and they guaranteed that they would no longer snack on leftovers from each meal. This way, the children could get sick less often, and they could also save.

　　Chen Xiuqing was very busy, so I went to Zhou Wanqing's house at 8 Houchixi Street.

　　Zhou Wanqing's family also has five people. After the household-based ration verification and supply, her family bought 125 jin of grain in June and 120 jin in July. Both months, it was just enough, no more, no less. In August, with rationed supply per person and grade: Zhou Wanqing receives 28 jin; her husband 32 jin; her father-in-law 28 jin; and her two children, a five-year-old daughter receives 14 jin, and a son under three years old receives 8 jin. The total is 110 jin, which is ten jin less than in July.

　　“What do you do about the difference?” I asked Zhou Wanqing.

　　She said, "Jia Yunqing's family adjusted two jin to us, and Luan Shuxian's family also adjusted four jin to us."

　　I asked: “Isn’t there still a difference?”

　　“There’s still a difference of three or four jin. We can get by by 'overcoming' a bit. In the past, we often didn’t plan when cooking, and waste was inevitable. For example, children asked for food whenever they wanted, adults gave it to them at will, and if they couldn't eat it, they would waste it. Now, even if it's a little tight, we can eat more steamed buns and fewer boiled noodles to save flour. Not rubbing the rice when washing it not only preserves the nutrients but also yields more cooked rice. We can also mix in some potatoes or sweet potatoes, which are also very good. With the same amount of grain, whether you save or not, whether it tastes good or not, depends entirely on the cook. As long as you think carefully, there are plenty of ways.” Zhou Wanqing gave me many examples of saving grain while still eating well. She is a housewife who is very good at coming up with ways to save. She also said: "In the past, our earnings were limited, but we didn’t keep track of how much grain we ate. Now the People's Government has come up with this method, and if we save money on grain, we can make more clothes to wear!"

　　拥护市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法
　　粮食定量供应对国家对个人都有好处
　　蔡鉴远
    在北京龙须沟畔，这些日子来居民们谈天的兴趣，经常集中在粮食定量供应办法上，家庭主妇们特别谈得津津有味。他们这里从八月份起就试行了这个办法。
      “人民政府想出的这个办法，我看很好。按户定量核实供应已经给了我们一些好处，现在按人分等定量供应，对我们好处更多。”住在牟家井十一号的妇女于桂荣，当我问起她粮食定量供应的情形时，她肯定地这样对我说。
    于桂荣家共三口人。她丈夫是京西矿务局的工人，每月例假时回家一两次。再就是她公公，一位六十二岁的老人，可是还三天五天地去拉一次煤屑卖，身体好，食量不小。今年一月到五月，她家平均每月买粮食七十三斤，每月总剩余十来斤。六月份粮食按户核实供应时，她家计划是六十二斤。七月份，她丈夫因为工作关系暂时不回家，计划核实六十斤。这两月，她公公都担心不够吃，实际都够吃了。于桂荣说：“可是有没有浪费，心眼里是稀里胡涂的。”八月份公布了新办法，按标准她是二十八斤，她公公也是二十八斤，合计五十六斤，比七月份少了四斤。
      “够不够吃？”我问。
    于桂荣朗爽地笑起来，说：“我心眼里不再稀里胡涂了，该节约的就注意节约。我已经盘算过，够。”
    “你公公有没有意见？”
    “其实，他老人家的老习惯还在心眼里没丢掉。”于桂荣接着说：“过去，一有个钱，他就叫买粮食去，总觉得应该存点粮食。不久以前，他还叨念着‘粮食那能每月吃光呵！’我告诉他，现在不用存粮，咱人民政府安排得好好的，有的是粮食。每月吃光，接着买正好。我丈夫也给他说道理，现在确实够吃了，他也想通了。”
    邻居的妇女牛素芬抱着一个小女孩走来。她听我们谈的是粮食定量供应的事，也就一起谈起来。她告诉我，她家住在牟家井丙六号，也是三口人。她丈夫在中央生物制品检定所工作。实行粮食按人定量供应，她二十八斤，她丈夫三十一斤，孩子八斤，合计六十七斤。她说：“足足够吃了。”停了一下，她又说：“够吃不说，这新办法还有别的好处。”
    我问这新办法到底有什么好处，牛素芬说：“每月收入是一定的，现在每月吃的粮食也一定了，就可以更好地安排生活呵！”
      “这办法教咱节约了粮食，不再稀里胡涂乱蹧蹋。省了粮食对国家对咱个人都好。”于桂荣也插口说：“现在按干活轻重和年龄大小分等定量，也很合理！人民政府最先想到的就是咱劳动人民。”
    于桂荣又说，实行了这新办法，人民政府供应粮食的计划性更加加强了，可以更好地保证国家经济建设，并且管理起来也方便了。牛素芬接着说：
  “就粮食用户说，也省事了。过去按户核实，要每月每月费手续，现在只一次就定了。”
    为了了解更多的情况，我又到了北坛根十二号陈秀清家。她家是做鞋子的个体手工业户，共五口人。陈秀清告诉我，她丈夫是主要劳动力，粮食定量三十二斤；她除了家务以外也帮着丈夫做，二十八斤；读中学的女儿和儿子各三十五斤；还有在小学的儿子二十八斤。五人合计一百五十八斤。可是六、七月份按户定量核实供应时，她家只一百四十斤，现在多了十八斤。
      “多出十八斤怎么处理呢？”我问。
    陈秀清说：“调剂给少的，多了咱没用。”
    她接着解释说，不调剂给别人，就容易浪费掉。她家为此开过家庭会议，全家一致同意给别人。孩子们还说，要妈妈以后做饭也按一定计划，不多做，他们保证不再要每顿多下的熟食来零吃。这样，孩子可以少生病，还可以节约。
    陈秀清很忙，我就又到了后池西街八号周婉青家。
    周婉青家也是五口人。粮食按户定量核实供应以后，六月份她家买粮一百二十五斤，七月份买粮一百二十斤。两个月都不多不少，刚够吃。八月份按人分等定量：周婉青是二十八斤；她丈夫三十二斤；她公公二十八斤；还有两个孩子，五岁的女儿十四斤，不满三岁的儿子八斤。合计一百一十斤，同七月份比，差了十斤。
    “差的怎么办呢？”我问周婉青。
    她说：“贾云青家调剂给我们二斤，栾淑贤家也调剂给我们四斤。”
    我问：“不是还差吗？”
    “还差三、四斤，‘克服’着点可以过得去了。咱以前做饭常常没计划，浪费免不了。比如孩子随便要，大人随便给，吃不了就蹧蹋了。现在就算紧一点吧，多吃顿馒头，少吃顿过水面，不就可以省面？淘米不搓，既营养，又可以多出饭；就掺点土豆、白薯吃吃，也是很好的。同样粮食，省不省，好吃不好吃，全在做饭的人，只要一细想，办法有的是。”周婉青对我举出许多节约粮食而又好吃的办法。她是一位很能开动脑筋找节约办法的家庭主妇。她还说：“过去是挣钱有限，吃粮没数。现在人民政府想出了这个办法，咱在粮食上省了钱，可以多制件衣服穿穿呵！”
