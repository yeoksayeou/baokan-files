Xinhua News Agency, 17th. The U.S. government, in violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement's clauses prohibiting the import of additional combat materials, has decided to continue shipping large quantities of additional war materials to equip the expanding Li Seung-man pseudo-army.

According to Sun Won-il, the South Korean "Minister of National Defense," who participated in the U.S.-Li talks in Washington, the United States will provide South Korea with $450 million in military aid in this fiscal year. According to the U.S. military aid plan for South Korea, the United States will double the firepower of South Korea's ten reserve divisions. The weapons supplied by the United States for this purpose include mortars, rocket launchers, and recoilless rifles.

Under this military aid plan, the United States will also train South Korean jet aircraft pilots. The handover ceremony of the first batch of seven U.S. jet trainers was held at the Suwon Air Base on the 17th. Prior to this, the United States had handed over five jet aircraft to Li Seung-man in June. It is reported that the United States plans to give Li Seung-man one hundred jet aircraft this year to establish a regiment, thirty of which will be handed over in September. After the economic and military negotiations between the United States and the Li Seung-man clique ended, Rannezil, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Far East Command, who had returned to Tokyo from Seoul on the 14th, rushed back to Seoul on the 15th to hold technical discussions with the Li Seung-man clique on military assistance.

    美国运入增援战争物资装备李伪军
    新华社十七日讯　美国政府违反朝鲜停战协定关于禁止运入增援作战物资的条款，决定继续运入大量增援战争物资来装备扩大中的李承晚伪军。
    据参加华盛顿美李会谈的南朝鲜“国防部长官”孙元一透露，美国在本财政年度将给南朝鲜四亿五千万美元的军事援助。根据美国对南朝鲜的军事援助计划，美国将把南朝鲜的十个后备师的火力增加一倍。美国为这个目的供应的武器包括迫击炮、火箭炮和无后座力炮。
    根据这项军事援助计划，美国还将训练南朝鲜的喷气式飞机驾驶员。第一批七架美国喷气式教练机的移交仪式，于十七日在水原空军基地举行。在这以前，美国曾在六月间交给李承晚五架喷气机。有消息说，美国准备在今年给李承晚一百架喷气机以便建立一个联队，其中三十架将在九月间移交。在美国和李承晚集团的经济和军事谈判结束后，已在十四日从汉城回到东京的远东美军总司令兰尼兹尔，又在十五日赶回汉城，准备同李承晚集团举行关于军事援助的技术性的讨论。
