To Discipline the Grain Depot Director Who Wasted Grain
To the Editor:

　　Tao Diangong, the director of the Fourth District Grain Depot in Guyuan County, Hebei Province, has consistently neglected grain storage work. Last year, after the pre-levy, more than 60,000 jin of wheat were stored in a grain pool. Soon after, the southern part of the grain pool collapsed. Workers suggested to Tao Diangong that it be repaired, but Tao Diangong not only did not accept the suggestion, but also said, "There is plenty of grain in the Fourth District, it doesn't matter if some of it goes bad." When the wheat was being turned over last November, it was indeed discovered that the grain was sprouting and moldy. Tao Diangong didn't care at all. In order to cover up his mistakes, he even ordered the workers to dig a pit at night and bury all the sprouted wheat, about 500 jin, and mixed the large batch of heated wheat into the good grain for transfer. I believe that Tao Diangong's malicious attitude towards national grain should be disciplined.

　　要处分糟塌粮食的粮库主任编辑同志：
    河北省沽源县第四区粮库主任陶殿功一贯忽视粮食保管工作。去年预征后，有六万多斤小麦储存在一个粮池里。不久，粮池南部倒塌了。工人们向陶殿功提出修整的意见，陶殿功不但没有接受，反而说：“四区粮食有的是，坏点没有什么。”去年十一月间小麦倒囤的时候，果然发现了粮食有生芽霉烂的现象。陶殿功也毫不在乎。为了隐瞒自己的过失，他竟叫工人在夜间把生芽的小麦约五百多斤全部掘坑埋掉，并将大批发热的小麦混在好粮食中调出去。我认为陶殿功用这种恶劣态度对待国家粮食，应该受到处分。
