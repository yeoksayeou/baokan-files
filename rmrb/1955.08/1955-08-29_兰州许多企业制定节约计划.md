Many state-owned newly built factories, expansion factories, and a construction enterprise in Lanzhou, including Lanzhou Refinery, Gansu Provincial Mining Bureau, and Lanzhou Power Plant, have formulated conservation targets and specific measures for the second half of this year in accordance with the spirit of comprehensive conservation. They will save the state more than 7 million yuan.

In their conservation plans, all units first drastically reduced expenditures on non-productive construction, saving a total of more than 4 million yuan for the state, accounting for more than 64 percent of the total savings. The Lanzhou Refinery changed some planned office buildings and all single-person dormitory buildings to single-story buildings, reducing the unit price from 102 yuan to 64 yuan and 40 yuan respectively. After lowering the construction standards of family dormitory buildings, the unit price was reduced from 102 yuan to 60 yuan. In this way, more than 2.4 million yuan was saved for the state. The Lanzhou Power Plant reduced the construction area of ​​the office building and canteen by 600 square meters, and adopted some conservation measures during construction, saving the state more than 100,000 yuan. In formulating their plans, all units also appropriately reduced the cost of productive construction according to different situations. (Our correspondent in Lanzhou)

　　兰州许多企业制定节约计划
    兰州炼油厂、甘肃省矿务局、兰州电厂等四个国营新建厂、两个扩建厂和一个建筑企业，根据全面节约的精神已经制定出今年下半年的节约指标和具体措施，将为国家节约七百多万元。
    各单位在节约计划中，首先大量削减了非生产性建设的开支，共节约国家资金四百多万元，占节约总数百分之六十四以上。兰州炼油厂把计划修建的一部分办公楼房和全部单人宿舍楼房改为平房，单价分别由一百零二元降低为六十四元和四十元；把家属宿舍楼房的建筑标准降低以后，单价由一百零二元降低到六十元。这样，就为国家节约了二百四十多万元。兰州电厂削减了六百平方公尺的办公楼和食堂的建筑面积，并在施工中采取了一些节约措施，共为国家节约十多万元。各单位在制定计划中，还分别不同情况适当降低了生产性建设的成本。　（本报驻兰州记者）
