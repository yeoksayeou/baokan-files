    Sincere Efforts for a Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Question

    At the Pyongyang mass rally on August 14th celebrating the 10th anniversary of the liberation of Korea, Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, delivered an important report. In the report, Premier Kim Il-sung put forward positive proposals for the peaceful reunification of Korea. These proposals fully demonstrated the Korean people's firm will and significant efforts to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean question and to achieve the reunification of their motherland through peaceful consultation.

    Premier Kim Il-sung pointed out the correct path for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. He said: "The question of Korean reunification must be resolved according to the will of the Korean people themselves. To this end, foreign troops must be withdrawn, and the North and South Korean people must sit down together to discuss the Korean question without foreign interference, establish a unified democratic central government based on the free will of the North and South Korean people, and define the nature of the government by the representatives elected by the people."

    Premier Kim Il-sung believes that to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea, it is first necessary to consolidate the Korean armistice and create conditions for contact between North and South Korea. To this end, he proposed that the countries concerned about the Korean question should undertake obligations to guarantee that no war will occur again in Korea and to guarantee that no actions threatening Korean peace will occur. He proposed that a Far Eastern conference with broad participation of Asian countries be convened by the relevant countries to seek a plan for the peaceful reunification of Korea. Premier Kim Il-sung suggested that the authorities of North and South Korea should declare that they will not use any force against each other, but will only use peaceful methods to resolve all issues related to the reunification of Korea. He suggested reducing the armies of North and South Korea to a minimum. Premier Kim Il-sung also advocated convening a conference of representatives of the North and South Korean governments as soon as possible to discuss the issue of unifying Korea.

    Premier Kim Il-sung's proposals and suggestions are necessary steps to consolidate the Korean armistice and enable the Korean issue to be resolved peacefully. All countries and peoples that are truly concerned about peace and security in the Far East cannot but agree with these proposals. Only those who are determined to maintain the division of Korea and are unwilling to peacefully resolve the Korean question will not consider these practical and feasible proposals. In order to continue to obstruct efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean question, they emphasize that the United Nations, one of the belligerents in the Korean War, should supervise the Korean elections, attempting to block the path to peaceful reunification of Korea. This kind of proposition will inevitably bring about the consequence of intensifying the tense situation.

    Recently, the Syngman Rhee clique openly clamored to seize the area north of the military demarcation line and south of the 38th parallel, and exerted violence against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission that supervises the armistice, attempting to force the commission to withdraw from South Korea. The United States has also openly stated that it wants to undermine the armistice agreement and abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. According to the Associated Press, the U.S. plan is to first "narrow" the "freedom of action" of the commission, that is, to make it unable to function normally, and then force the countries concerned to "agree to completely abolish" the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

    As some people in Washington have admitted, the U.S. request to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is to facilitate "unrestricted arms aid to South Korea" and to strengthen and expand the armaments of the Syngman Rhee clique. Now, the United States has openly announced that it will supply the Syngman Rhee clique with a large number of jet aircraft and training personnel, weapons, ammunition, and materials to equip a reserve force of ten divisions. There are reports that the United States is preparing to transport atomic cannons to South Korea. All this shows that the United States wants to create a fait accompli of destroying the Korean armistice agreement in order to aggravate the tense situation in the Far East.

    The fact is very clear that one of the important steps to ease the situation in the Far East is to stop all acts that undermine the Korean armistice agreement, stabilize the Korean armistice, and actively seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. For the sake of peace in the Far East, the Korean armistice agreement must not be allowed to be undermined, and the peaceful reunification of Korea must be realized. Premier Kim Il-sung's proposal on the peaceful resolution of the Korean question points out a clear path for achieving these two urgent goals.

    The Chinese people have always had deep sympathy for the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on August 11th, reiterating our consistent position that all foreign troops should withdraw from Korea and that the countries concerned should guarantee the peaceful development of Korea so that the Korean people can peacefully resolve the issue of Korean reunification. We also advocate that a Far Eastern conference with the participation of Asian countries should be held to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean question. We fully support the specific proposals for the peaceful resolution of the Korean question put forward by Premier Kim Il-sung. We believe that the proposals put forward by Premier Kim Il-sung should be given serious consideration by all parties concerned and should be realized.

### 和平解决朝鲜问题的真诚努力

    和平解决朝鲜问题的真诚努力
    在八月十四日平壤各界庆祝朝鲜解放十周年大会上，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成作了重要报告。在报告中，金日成首相就和平统一朝鲜问题提出了积极的主张。这些主张充分表现了朝鲜人民为了谋求和平解决朝鲜问题、通过和平协商来实现自己祖国统一的坚决意志和重大努力。
    金日成首相指出了和平解决朝鲜问题的正确途径。他说：“朝鲜的统一问题必须按照朝鲜人自己的意志加以解决。为此，必须撤走外国军队，在没有外国干涉的情况下，南北朝鲜人民坐在一起讨论朝鲜问题，以南北朝鲜人民的自由意志为基础，建立统一的民主的中央政府，由人民选举的代表规定政府的性质。”
    金日成首相认为，要实现朝鲜的和平统一，首先必须巩固朝鲜停战和创造南北朝鲜相互接触的条件。为此，他主张关心朝鲜问题的有关国家应当承担义务，保证在朝鲜不再发生战争，保证不发生威胁朝鲜和平的任何行动。他主张由各有关国家召开有亚洲国家广泛参加的远东会议，来谋求和平统一朝鲜的方案。金日成首相建议由南北朝鲜政权当局宣布不行使任何反对对方的武力，而只以和平方法来解决一切有关统一朝鲜的问题。他建议把南北朝鲜的军队缩减到最低限度。金日成首相并且主张尽速召开南北朝鲜政府代表会议，以讨论统一朝鲜的问题。
    金日成首相的这些建议和主张，是巩固朝鲜停战，并使朝鲜问题得以和平解决的必要步骤。凡是真正关心远东和平和安全的国家和人民都不能不赞成这些主张。只有那些一心要保持朝鲜的分裂状态，不愿意和平解决朝鲜问题的人们，才会不考虑这些切实可行的主张。为了继续阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题的努力，他们强调要使朝鲜战争中的交战一方—联合国来监督朝鲜选举，企图堵死和平统一朝鲜的门径。这种主张必然会带来加剧紧张局势的后果。
    最近，李承晚集团公开叫嚣要夺取军事分界线以北、三八线以南的地区，并且对监督停战的中立国监察委员会施加暴力，企图胁迫委员会撤离南朝鲜。美国方面也公开表示要破坏停战协定，取消中立国监察委员会。据合众社报道，美国的计划是第一步“缩小”委员会的“活动自由”，也就是使它不能正常进行工作，然后迫使有关国家“同意完全撤销”中立国监察委员会。
    如华盛顿的某些人士所承认的，美国要求撤销中立国监察委员会，是为了便于“给予南朝鲜不受限制的武器援助”，加强和扩大李承晚集团的武装。现在，美国已经公开宣布将供给李承晚集团大批喷气式飞机和训练人员、武器、军火以及装备十师后备军的物资。有消息说，美国正准备把原子大炮运到南朝鲜。这一切说明美国想造成破坏朝鲜停战协定的既成事实，以便加剧远东的紧张局势。
    事实很清楚，缓和远东局势的重要步骤之一，是制止一切破坏朝鲜停战协定的行为，稳定朝鲜的停战，并积极谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决。为了远东和平的利益，朝鲜停战协定决不容许破坏，朝鲜的和平统一必须实现。金日成首相的关于和平解决朝鲜问题的建议，正是为实现这两个迫切的目标指出了明确的途径。
    中国人民对于朝鲜人民争取和平统一祖国的斗争一向抱有深切的同情。我国外交部八月十一日发表声明，重申我国一贯主张一切外国军队应该撤出朝鲜，有关国家应该保证朝鲜的和平发展，以便朝鲜人民能够和平解决朝鲜的统一问题。我国并且主张应该举行一次有亚洲国家参加的远东会议，来谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决。我们完全支持金日成首相提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的具体建议。我们认为，金日成首相提出的建议应该得到一切有关方面的郑重考虑，并使之得以实现。
