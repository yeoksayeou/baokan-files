Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 24th. Reconstruction of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant has begun. Currently, more than ten projects are under construction simultaneously. On a large open space next to the Heavy Metalworking Shop, civil construction workers have already laid the concrete foundation for a new factory building. This new factory building will be connected to the old Heavy Metalworking Shop, expanding the original workshop. A new assembly shop will also be built here. In the Medium Metalworking Shop, which was originally just an empty factory building, workers have already installed most of the machine tools. The entire factory's water supply, drainage, and electrical wiring are also being renovated according to a new plan. The boiler room, which supplies steam for the entire factory's production and heating, is also being expanded.

　　The factory director told reporters that in addition to the projects that have already started, some important workshops will also begin reconstruction this year or next year. After the reconstruction, the factory's original equipment capacity will be fully utilized. Among the factory's products such as steel ingots, forgings, castings, and machines, the proportion of machine products will increase from the current 30% to 70%. By the end of the first Five-Year Plan, the factory will be able to use pig iron and steel produced by Anshan Iron and Steel Company to produce various giant crushers, ball mills, blast furnaces for ironmaking, and mechanical equipment for steelmaking open-hearth furnaces, as well as large-scale equipment for mechanical manufacturing and other industries.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, August 24th. The high-voltage transmission line project between Taiyuan, Yuci, and Yangquan officially commenced construction on the 22nd.

　　The Taiyuan-Yuci-Yangquan high-voltage transmission line is an important power industry construction project in the country's first Five-Year Plan. This high-voltage line is more than one hundred kilometers long, passing through more than one hundred villages in three counties. After the completion of this high-voltage transmission line, the strong power from the newly built Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant will be transmitted to Yangquan City to meet the needs of coal mining and the production of more industrial products.

　　The unit responsible for designing this high-voltage transmission line revised the design based on the spirit of comprehensive economization, which can save hundreds of tons of steel and cement compared to the original design.

### 沈阳重型机器厂十几项改建工程开始施工　太原、榆次、阳泉间高压输电线工程动工

　　沈阳重型机器厂十几项改建工程开始施工
　　太原、榆次、阳泉间高压输电线工程动工
    新华社沈阳二十四日电　沈阳重型机器厂的改建已经开始。现在，有十几项工程正在同时施工。在重型金工车间旁边一大片光秃秃的空地上，土木建筑工人已经为新的厂房打下了混凝土基础。这座新厂房将要和旧的重型金工车间厂房贯穿起来，把原有车间加以扩大。新的装配车间也要在这里建设起来。原来只是一座空洞洞厂房的中型金工车间，工人们已把大部分的工作母机安装起来。全厂上下水道、电气线路也正在按新的规划进行修建。担负全厂生产、采暖蒸汽供应的锅炉房也在扩建。
    这个工厂的厂长告诉记者说，除了现在已经动工的工程外，还有些重要车间在今年或明年里也都要开始改建。经过改建以后，这个厂的原有设备能力将得到充分发挥。在全厂生产的钢锭、锻件、铸件、机器等产品中，机器产品将由现在占百分之三十提高到百分之七十。到第一个五年计划完了时，这个厂就可以利用鞍山钢铁公司生产的生铁、钢材生产出冶炼工业用的各种巨型破碎机、球磨机、炼铁高炉和炼钢平炉上的机械设备，以及机械制造等工业用的大型设备。
    新华社太原二十四日电　太（原）、榆（次）、阳（泉）之间的高压输电线工程在二十二日正式动工架设。
    太、榆、阳高压输电线是国家第一个五年计划中的一项重要的电力工业建设工程。这条高压线全长一百多公里，中途经过三个县的一百多个村庄。这条高压输电线建成后，将把新建太原电热厂的强大电力输送到阳泉市，供开采煤炭和生产更多工业产品的需要。
    负责设计这条高压输电线的单位曾根据全面节约精神，修改了设计，比原来的设计可以节约几百吨钢材和水泥。
