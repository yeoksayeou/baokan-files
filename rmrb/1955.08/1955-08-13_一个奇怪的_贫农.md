In early 1950, two strangers, a man and a woman, arrived in the remote Qingju Township, Third Village, Nanchong County, Sichuan Province. The man had thick eyebrows and glaring eyes, wore a Taiwanese straw hat, and was dressed in a woolen coat. The woman wore a red wool sweater, leather shoes, and had a perm.

On their second day in the village, they threw a grand feast, inviting guests. During the feast, the man introduced himself as Yang Dafa from Guang'an County, saying that he had lost both parents at a young age and had followed his uncle out to do cigarette and fruit business in Chengdu and Chongqing for many years. He said that he anticipated that doing business after liberation would have "no future," so he prepared to come here to rent land and farm. Following this, Yang Dafa rented land, settled down, and with his wife, went everywhere to find farmers to become sworn relatives, and to recognize her maiden family. After they recognized farmer Teng Mingqing's wife as her maiden family, they gave gifts like wool sweaters and floral cloth.

Within a few days of arriving in Qingju Township, Third Village, Yang Dafa changed his attire, put on homespun clothes, and "buried himself" in farming. He often went to the fields to work before dawn. On days of heavy rain and snow, when others rested at home, he went to the fields. The weeds in his fields were often cleaned very neatly, he accumulated the most fertilizer, and the land's yield increased year after year. In this way, he deceived people into making him a mutual aid team leader. In the team, he only took on heavy and difficult work, often helped team members with their work, and showed great solicitude towards the farmers.

During rent reduction and deposit refunds and land reform, Yang Dafa "actively" participated in struggles, watched over landlords, was assessed as a "poor peasant," and was even allocated land. He deliberately took out half of the grain he was allocated and donated it to the peasant association. During the unified grain purchase, he not only "enthusiastically" sold grain, but also dried and cleaned the grain, and specially selected blazing hot days to send it to the government warehouse. He also "took the lead" in promoting advanced cultivation techniques advocated by the government, such as close planting of single corn stalks.

Yang Dafa would often go three days without saying two words. When he did speak, he would stammer. He was very "amiable" to people and never argued with anyone. He appeared to be a kind and honest "farmer." Some people said he was honest and hardworking, and he was very pleased with himself.

Despite Yang Dafa's many "good" performances, some farmers in the village suspected him when he first arrived in Qingju Township, Third Village, believing that his background was unclear: if he was from Guang'an, why didn't he return to Guang'an? Why were this couple dressed so lavishly? Why did this person become so close to several Kuomintang elements in the village after he arrived? These questions aroused the farmers' attention. Old farmer Hu Deqing, who was in the same mutual aid team as him and also his neighbor, once discovered this "poor peasant" couple and several Kuomintang elements in a secret conversation in the house. Hu Deqing quietly leaned against the wall to listen to what they were saying; he only heard: "...according to my past temper, I would have killed a few of them already... just wait, the world will still be ours in the future." On another occasion, Hu Deqing was listening to this couple quarrel from next door, and only heard the woman say, "The government wants to catch spies, where are they going to catch them! What are you doing yourself, how dare you confess to the township!" At this point, the man dared not say anything. Hu Deqing thought to himself: Could this guy be a spy?

Another farmer, Teng Mingzhong, who often paid attention to the actions of this "poor peasant," once carried things with Yang Dafa and, while passing a dangerous mountain, heard this "poor peasant" mutter to himself, "If anything unexpected happens in the future, this would be a good place to take refuge." One time, Yang Dafa suddenly wanted to go to the Huaying Mountains to burn incense. Teng Mingzhong wanted to find out what he was going to do, so he volunteered to lead the way. When they reached the foot of the mountain, Yang Dafa insisted that Teng Mingzhong go back, and Yang Dafa went up the mountain alone and stayed there for several days. Teng Mingzhong found this suspicious and reported all these situations to the local public security organs.

Other informants included elementary school teacher Teng Zhiyuan and worker Lei Kaiyun. Teng Zhiyuan's home was in Qingju Township, and he had once participated in the Kuomintang. Yang Dafa had once wooed him, revealing that he had carried a gun in the pseudo-Southwest Military and Political Office and had done important work in the Second Department of the pseudo-Ministry of National Defense. He also spread rumors to Teng Zhiyuan, saying: "The Third World War is about to break out, and the Kuomintang will soon return to the mainland." After ideological reform and study, Teng Zhiyuan wrote a letter to the public security organs to report him. Lei Kaiyun, a hired worker who had helped Yang Dafa's mother-in-law for many years, learned this year that Yang Dafa had hidden his name and gone into hiding in Qingju Township, and immediately reported to the public security organs Yang Dafa's real name and the fact that before liberation, he wore a suit inside, a coat outside, and carried a gun and handcuffs everywhere to arrest people.

More than five years passed quickly. On June 17th of this year, public security personnel suddenly appeared in front of Yang Dafa and arrested him according to law. At first, he still quibbled, saying, "You are arresting spies, aren't you? I am a 'poor peasant,' don't make a mistake." When the public security personnel announced his crimes, pointing out that he was Yang Jinxing, the murderer of General Yang Hucheng, Luo Shiwen, the head of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Che Yaoxian, and many revolutionary workers, in the face of ironclad facts, this heinous murderer finally had to lower his head and confess his guilt, admitting that he was indeed the extremely wicked Yang Jinxing.

    一个奇怪的“贫农”
    新华社
    一九五○年初，四川省偏僻的南充县青居乡三村，来了两个陌生的男女。男的浓眉横眼，头戴台草帽，身穿呢衣；女的穿着红绒线衣、皮鞋，烫了发。
    他们到村上第二天，就大排筵席请客。在席间，男的介绍他叫杨大发，是广安县人，自幼父母双亡，随叔父外出，在成都、重庆做了多年香烟、水果生意；他说，他料想解放后经商“无前途”，所以准备来这里佃田务农。接着，杨大发就佃了田，定居下来，并带着他的妻子到处找农民认干亲，认娘家。他们和农民滕明清的妻子认做娘家后，送了绒线衣、花布等礼物。
    杨大发到青居乡三村不几天就改了装，穿上了土布衣服，“埋头”做庄稼。经常天不亮就下田做活。大雨大雪的日子，别人在家休息，他却下田。他田里的草经常铲得干干净净的，肥料积得最多，田地年年增产。这样，他就骗当了互助组长。在组里，他专找笨重活干，常帮助组员做活，向农民献殷勤。
    杨大发在减租退押和土地改革中，“积极”参加斗争、看管地主，被评为“贫农”，还分得了土地。他把分得的粮食故意拿出一半来捐给农民协会。粮食统购中，他不但“踊跃”售粮，还把粮食晒干风净，专选烈日炎天送到政府仓库里。他还“带头”推广政府号召的包谷单株密植等先进耕作技术。
    杨大发三天不讲两句话，讲时也是结结巴巴的。对人满“和气”，从不同人争执。看起来，他真是个和善、老实的“庄稼人”。有些人说他老实、肯干，他很得意。
    尽管杨大发有这许多“好”表现，可是当他刚来到青居乡三村的时候，村上就有农民怀疑他，认为他来路不明：说是广安人，为什么不回广安？这对夫妻为什么穿得那样阔气？这个人来后为什么就同村上几个国民党分子处得火热？这些问题引起了农民的注意。和他同在一个互助组又是邻居的老农民胡德清，有一次发现这对“贫农”夫妇和几个国民党分子在屋里密谈，胡德清便悄悄地靠壁听他们讲些什么；只听到：“……依我过去脾气，早杀掉他妈几个……等着吧，将来还是我们的天下。”另一次，胡德清在隔壁注意听这一对夫妇吵架，只听女的说道：“政府要捉特务，那里去捉呀！你自己干些啥，敢到乡上坦白！”说到这里，男的不敢吭气。胡德清心想：难道这家伙是特务？
    经常注意这个“贫农”行动的另一农民滕明忠，有一次和杨大发一起挑东西，路过一座险山，听到这个“贫农”小声地自言自语地说：“以后出啥意外，这里倒是个避难的好地方。”有一回，杨大发突然要到华蓥山进香，滕明忠想探听他去干啥，自愿给他带路。行到山麓，杨大发硬要滕明忠回去，而杨大发便独自上山，并在那里住了好几天。滕明忠觉得这事很可疑，便把这些情况一一报告了当地公安机关。
    检举的人还有小学教员滕志远，工人雷开云等。滕志远家在青居乡，曾经参加过国民党。杨大发曾经拉拢过他，向他暴露自己曾在伪西南长官公署背过枪，在伪国防部第二厅干过重要工作。还向滕志远造谣说：“第三次世界大战就要爆发，国民党不久要重回大陆。”滕志远经过思想改造学习后，写信到公安机关检举了他。曾帮这个杨大发丈母干了多年活的雇工雷开云，今年探知杨大发在青居乡隐姓埋名潜伏后，立刻向公安机关报告了杨大发的真名和解放前他内穿西装，外罩便衣，身藏手枪、铁铐，到处捕人等情况。
    五年多的时间匆匆地过去了。今年六月十七日，公安人员突然出现在杨大发面前，依法将他逮捕了。开始他还狡辩说：“你们是捉特务吧，我是个‘贫农’，别弄错了。”当公安人员宣布他的罪状，指明他就是杀害杨虎城将军、杀害中共四川省委负责人罗世文、车耀先及许多革命工作人员的杨进兴时，在铁的事实面前这个万恶滔天的杀人刽子手，终于不得不低头认罪，供认自己确是罪大恶极的杨进兴。
