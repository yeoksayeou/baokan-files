    Our Country Imports a Batch of Mongolian Draft Horses

    A total of 13,000 draft horses imported from the Mongolian People's Republic have arrived at the border in succession from the end of June to the present. The Mongolian Horse Management Office of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives is receiving them and distributing them to the supply and marketing cooperatives in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, and Rehe provinces for use by farmers. At present, various provinces have transported the allocated draft horses back to their provinces.

    This year, our country has ordered a total of 24,000 draft horses from the Mongolian People's Republic. The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives sent a delegation to ten provinces of the Mongolian People's Republic in May to conduct acceptance inspections. All imported horses will be received by the end of August. (Li Deshen)

    我国进口一批蒙古耕马
    由蒙古人民共和国进口的耕马，从六月底到目前已先后到达国境的有一万三千匹。中华全国供销合作总社的蒙马经营处一面接收，一面就将这批耕马分配给河北、河南、山东、山西、热河等省的供销合作社，以便供给农民使用。目前各省已将分配到的耕马赶运回省。
    今年，我国向蒙古人民共和国订购耕马共计两万四千匹，中华全国供销合作总社早在五月间派出代表团到达蒙古人民共和国十个省份进行验收。进口的马将在八月底以前全部接收完毕。（李德深）
