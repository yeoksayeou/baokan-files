Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 3rd: The Indonesian News Agency reports that Sukiman (Masyumi Party), Wilopo (National Party), and Assaat (independent), who were commissioned to form the new Indonesian cabinet, returned their letters of mandate to Vice President Hatta on the 3rd, because they were unable to reach an agreement among themselves. Hatta announced to reporters on the 3rd that he had accepted the returned mandates. Hatta said that Sukiman, one of the cabinet formers, was instructed by the Masyumi Party to jointly return the mandate, so there was no reason for the other two to continue their efforts to form a new cabinet.

In answering the question of why the cabinet formation failed, Hatta said: "The Masyumi Party and the National Party did not reach an agreement on the procedure for implementing the agreement reached by the three cabinet formers, that Hatta would serve as Prime Minister in the cabinet." Sources said that earlier, a stalemate was imminent due to disputes between the Masyumi Party and the National Party over the position of Prime Minister. Later, due to Assaat's proposal, they had agreed to have Vice President Hatta serve as Prime Minister, but ultimately no agreement was reached.

    印度尼西亚苏基曼等组阁失败
    新华社雅加达三日电　据印度尼西亚新闻社报道，受命组织印度尼西亚新内阁的苏基曼（马斯友美党）、韦洛坡（国民党）和阿萨特（无党派）三人在三日把委任书退回给副总统哈达，因为他们未能在他们自己之间达成协议。据哈达三日对记者宣布，他已经接受了退回的委任书。哈达说，组阁人员之一的苏基曼奉马斯友美党的训令，要他联合退回委任书，因此，其他两人就没有理由继续进行组织新阁的努力。
    哈达在回答组阁失败原因的问题时说：“马斯友美党和国民党之间在关于实现三位组阁人员曾经同意的由哈达在内阁中担任总理的协议的程序问题上没有达成协议。”消息说，早些时候，由于马斯友美党和国民党在总理职位上发生争执，僵局已经迫在眉睫。后来，由于阿萨特的建议，他们曾同意由副总统哈达担任总理职位，但最后仍然没有达成协议。
