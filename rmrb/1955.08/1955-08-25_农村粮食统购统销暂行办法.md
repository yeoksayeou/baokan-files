Provisional Measures for the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas

Chapter I General Principles

Article 1: These provisional measures are formulated to implement the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, to institutionalize the unified purchase and sale of grain in rural areas, to further enhance farmers' enthusiasm for production, to increase grain production, to promote grain conservation, and to ensure the needs of the state and the people for grain, in order to facilitate socialist construction.

Article 2: The unified purchase and sale of grain in rural areas shall separately verify the grain yield of each farmer household, separately stipulate the grain consumption standards for various types of farmers and non-grain-producing rural residents, and calculate the grain consumption amount on a household basis. Farmer households that produce grain, after deducting grain consumption and the actual amount of agricultural tax from the verified grain yield, those with surplus grain are surplus grain households, those with neither surplus nor deficiency are self-sufficient households, and those with insufficient grain are grain-deficient households. Non-grain-producing rural residents are also grain-deficient households. The state shall conduct unified purchase of grain from surplus grain households by separately verifying the grain sales tasks and conduct unified sales of grain to grain-deficient households by separately verifying the grain supply amount. Self-sufficient households will not be subject to unified purchase or sale. The verification of grain yield and calculation of grain consumption shall be based on the area of grain fields, the number of permanent residents in the household, and the number of livestock fed with grain.

Article 3: The verification of grain yield of farmer households, the grain sales tasks of surplus grain households, and the grain supply amount of grain-deficient households must be based on the grain production, purchase, and sales figures initially allocated to the township around the spring plowing of 1955, combined with the actual situation. The township people's committee shall fully mobilize the masses, conduct in-depth discussions, divide households into surplus grain households, self-sufficient households, and grain-deficient households, and assess the annual grain yield, sales tasks, and supply amount in one go. After being approved by the township people's congress, a register shall be created and reported to the county-level people's committee or its designated agency for verification.

Article 4: Under normal circumstances, the grain sales tasks of surplus grain households verified by household in 1955 shall remain unchanged for three years from 1955 onwards, with increased production not leading to increased purchase. The grain supply amount for grain-deficient households shall be verified annually. Completing the grain sales tasks verified by the state is a glorious obligation for surplus grain households. Grain-deficient households that produce grain should strive to produce more grain to achieve self-sufficiency and even have a surplus.

Article 5: For grain production, purchase, and sales quotas, individual farmers and mutual aid teams should use the household as a unit; agricultural production cooperatives may use the cooperative as a unit or the household as a unit. For agricultural production cooperatives that conduct grain production, purchase, and sales quotas on a cooperative basis, the specific measures should be stipulated by the people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and directly administered municipality based on the principle of both taking into account the development of agricultural production cooperatives and ensuring the completion of the state's unified grain purchase tasks.

Article 6: Surplus grain remaining after surplus grain households have completed their grain sales tasks, and surplus grain from self-sufficient households due to increased production and conservation, shall have the right to dispose of freely. They can be freely stored, freely used, continue to be sold to the state or cooperatives, traded in the state grain market, or exchanged between farmers without interference. However, no one is allowed to engage in speculation with grain.

Article 7: If farmers sell self-used grain to the state at the unified grain purchase price due to economic turnover or variety adjustment needs, and then want to buy it back later, the state should purchase it and issue a turnover grain certificate, allowing them to buy it back later at the unified grain sales price with the certificate. However, farmers are not encouraged to sell turnover grain. Turnover grain should be statistically separated from unified purchase and sale grain.

Article 8: After the new grain harvest and before the end of the unified grain purchase work, the types of grain purchased under the unified purchase system can only be sold to the state and are not allowed to be sold to private individuals. Non-unified purchase grain varieties are allowed to enter the state grain market for trading at any time without restrictions. After the completion of the grain unified purchase task, the county-level people's committee should formally announce the end of the grain unified purchase work, allowing the types of grain purchased under the unified purchase system to enter the state grain market for trading and developing the state grain market. Both buyers and sellers in the state grain market do not need any certificates, but grain speculators must be strictly suppressed.

Chapter II Setting Production Quotas

Article 9: The grain yield of farmer households shall be calculated according to the average annual yield per unit area of grain fields, allocated to the household. The average annual yield per unit area of grain fields of farmer households shall be assessed based on the figures initially set to the township around the spring plowing of 1955, according to the quality of the land and natural conditions, combined with the management conditions of the farmer households. For grain fields with normal harvests in 1955, the average annual yield per unit area should be assessed according to the actual yield. For grain fields with particularly good or poor harvests in 1955, the average annual yield per unit area should be assessed according to the yield in a normal year. In areas where the unit area yield of grain fields has been assessed in 1954, if the set yield is roughly in line with the actual yield in 1955, the assessed annual yield can be verified by appropriately adjusting the parts that are too high or too low based on the established yield.

Article 10: The average annual yield per unit area of grain fields verified in 1955 shall remain unchanged for three years from 1955 onwards. Grain-deficient households that produce grain should use the verified average annual yield as the base number and add the annual planned production increase target as the current year's yield. In a normal year, if the actual increase in production of grain-deficient households is greater than the planned production increase target, no further calculation will be made. In order to encourage grain-deficient farmers to plant cash crops according to the state plan, their grain fields will not be subject to production increase targets within three years after the unit area average annual yield is verified.

Article 11: Tuber crops should generally be calculated for yield, and tuber crops can be converted into grain at a certain ratio, based on the principle of both appropriately encouraging tuber crop production and not affecting the state's unified grain purchase tasks. The conversion method shall be stipulated by the people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and directly administered municipality.

Article 12: For newly reclaimed wasteland after setting production quotas, yield will not be calculated for three years from the year of the first harvest. Grain produced using field ridges, grounds, and vacant homesteads may not be counted for yield.

Chapter III Setting Purchase Quotas

Article 13: The grain consumption amount of farmer households shall generally include three items: seeds, food grain, and feed grain (feed grain is not included in areas that have never used grain as feed). The standards for each item of grain consumption shall be stipulated by the people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and directly administered municipality according to the following principles: 1. Seed grain standards should be stipulated according to actual needs; 2. Food grain and feed grain standards should be stipulated according to the general consumption level in each region; areas where grain consumption standards have been set in 1954 should adjust the parts that are too high or too low based on the established standards; 3. Grain consumption standards can be stipulated separately for seeds, food grain, and feed grain, or a unified purchase exemption quota can be stipulated per person; 4. In areas that produce tuber crops, an appropriate ratio of tuber crops to food grain and feed grain consumption should be stipulated according to local consumption habits.

Article 14: The state's unified purchase of grain from surplus grain households should generally account for 80% to 90% of the remaining grain amount; the purchase rate should be stipulated as a single ratio and not progressively; the purchase rate for rich peasant surplus grain should be appropriately increased. The specific purchase rate shall be stipulated by the people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and directly administered municipality.

Article 15: The grain produced by state-owned farms and local state-owned farms, in addition to retaining the necessary grain for use according to the prescribed grain consumption standards, all surplus grain should be sold to the state. The grain consumption standards for state-owned farms and local state-owned farms shall be stipulated by the people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and directly administered municipality.

Article 16: Unified grain purchase should be conducted once a year in areas with one harvest a year; in areas with more than one harvest a year, it should be calculated uniformly throughout the year, and the proportion of summer and autumn unified purchase should be determined according to the summer and autumn grain yields, and carried out in two installments. The summer grain unified purchase figures will be settled uniformly at the time of the autumn grain unified purchase. In order to meet the needs of the state, farmers can be mobilized to deliver a portion of grain in advance before the start of the unified purchase. If farmers voluntarily deliver grain in advance, it should also be accepted as long as the quality is qualified, and offset against the grain sales task.

Article 17: The types of grain purchased under the unified purchase system should generally be mainly grains and soybeans, and a portion of minor grains can also be purchased. In areas where tuber crops are converted into grain for yield calculation, a portion of tuber crops can be purchased as appropriate according to supply needs and storage conditions.

Article 18: The quality of grain purchased under the unified purchase system should be based on the principle of facilitating safe storage and ensuring a certain rate of finished products. The people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and directly administered municipality shall stipulate the medium quality standard according to the past years' situation, referring to the degree of dryness, cleanliness, and plumpness of the grain of the current year. The grain sold by farmers to the state should be dried, winnowed, and meet the prescribed standards. Grassroots grain stations should price the grain according to the state price list and prescribed standards, based on quality.

Article 19: The location where farmers sell grain should be stipulated according to the direction of grain circulation and transportation, warehouse conditions, combined with local supply needs, and taking into account the convenience of farmers' sales. Grain needed for local supply should be stored locally.

Chapter IV Setting Sales Quotas

Article 20: The grain consumption standards for various types of grain-deficient households shall be stipulated by the people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and directly administered municipality according to the following principles: 1. Seed grain standards should be stipulated according to actual needs; 2. The food grain and feed grain standards for grain-deficient households in general grain-producing areas should be slightly lower than the grain consumption standards of local surplus grain households; 3. The food grain and feed grain standards for grain-deficient households that plant cash crops according to the state plan should not be lower than the grain consumption standards of local surplus grain households; 4. The food grain and feed grain standards for grain-deficient households in disaster areas should be lower than the grain consumption standards for grain-deficient households in normal years in the local area; 5. The food grain and feed grain standards for non-agricultural residents in rural areas should generally not exceed the grain consumption standards of local surplus grain households.

Article 21: The supply of grain for rural industrial and commercial industries shall be stipulated by the people's committees of each province and autonomous region with reference to the Provisional Measures for Rationed Grain Supply in Towns and Cities.

Article 22: The types of grain supplied to grain-deficient households can be supplied according to the principle of what the state has available in the local area, and a portion of tuber crops can also be supplied. However, the state grain authorities should make every effort to organize adjustments to appropriately take care of the needs of the masses.

Article 23: The grain supply to grain-deficient households should be based on the principle of supplying grain when it is deficient, separately assessing the time when each household starts to be supplied and the monthly supply plan. Grain-deficient households cannot purchase grain in advance, but the state can supply tuber crops in advance.

Article 24: After the grain supply amount and monthly supply plan for grain-deficient households are verified, the state grain authorities shall stipulate the grain purchase location and issue a grain supply certificate for rural grain-deficient households. The supply quantity, time, and location stipulated on the rural grain-deficient household grain supply certificate must be strictly observed by both grain-deficient households buying grain and grain stations supplying grain.

Article 25: When rural residents go out, if they are grain-deficient households, they can collect grain coupons from the designated grain station within the stipulated supply amount with the rural grain-deficient household grain supply certificate; if they are surplus grain households or self-sufficient households, they can bring their own grain or sell the grain to the state grain station or the agent designated by the grain station and exchange it for grain coupons.

Article 26: Rural residents who move to other places should go to the state grain station with their household registration transfer certificate to complete the grain supply transfer procedures. If they are grain-deficient households, they should exchange the rural grain-deficient household grain supply certificate for a grain supply transfer certificate from the state grain station; if they are surplus grain households or self-sufficient households, they can sell the remaining grain to the state grain station and receive a grain supply transfer certificate.

Chapter V Adjustment of Production, Purchase, and Sales Figures

Article 27: When verifying the grain purchase and sales figures for rural residents, appropriate care may be given to widowers, widows, orphans, the childless elderly, demobilized soldiers, and those who need to reduce grain sales tasks or increase grain supply amounts due to other special reasons. The measures for care shall be stipulated by the people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and directly administered municipality.

Article 28: After the grain production, purchase, and sales figures of farmer households are verified, if significant changes occur in natural conditions that significantly affect the harvest, the township people's committee shall adjust the originally set grain sales tasks or grain supply amount according to the degree of crop failure of the households with crop failures. When grain-deficient households have a bumper harvest, the originally set grain supply amount should be appropriately reduced according to their bumper harvest. All the above adjusted figures shall be reported by the township people's committee to the county-level people's committee for approval, and the county-level people's committee shall report to the provincial and autonomous region people's committees for record. When the above adjustment results cannot guarantee the originally set purchase-sales difference within the province or autonomous region, the provincial and autonomous region people's committees may appropriately increase purchases in areas with bumper harvests. If the increased purchases still cannot guarantee the originally set purchase-sales difference, they should submit their opinions to the State Council for decision. When a severe disaster occurs in one province, autonomous region, or several provinces, affecting the state's grain purchase and sales plan and making it impossible to balance, the State Council may designate provinces and autonomous regions with bumper harvests to appropriately increase purchases. When it is necessary to increase grain purchases from areas with bumper harvests due to the adjustment of purchase and sales figures, the increase in purchase figures should not exceed 40% of the increase in production of farmer households due to the bumper harvest.

Article 29: After the grain purchase and sales figures of farmer households are verified, within three years from 1955, the originally set figures will generally not be adjusted due to the birth or death of infants and the increase or decrease of livestock. However, if the originally set grain consumption amount is significantly insufficient or surplus due to population changes such as marriage, death, going out, returning home, and the increase or decrease of grain-fed draft animals, the adjustment can be calculated during the next year's unified purchase.

Article 30: After the grain production, purchase, and sales figures of farmer households are verified, when grain fields are increased, decreased, or transferred, the grain production, purchase, and sales figures of the relevant farmer households shall be adjusted according to the originally set yield of the increased, decreased, or transferred grain fields.

Article 31: After the grain purchase and sales figures of farmer households are verified, if there is an increase or decrease in the actual agricultural tax paid, the originally set grain purchase and sales figures should be increased or decreased by the same amount.

Article 32: After the grain production, purchase, and sales figures are verified, if grain-deficient households and self-sufficient households become surplus grain households, the grain sales tasks should be calculated according to surplus grain households. If surplus grain households and self-sufficient households become grain-deficient households, the grain supply amount should be calculated according to grain-deficient households.

Article 33: After the grain production, purchase, and sales figures are verified, the measures for adjusting the grain production, purchase, and sales figures caused by individual farmers joining agricultural production cooperatives or members of agricultural production cooperatives withdrawing from the cooperative shall be stipulated by the people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and directly administered municipality.

Article 34: Under normal circumstances, if the originally set grain purchase and sales figures of provinces and autonomous regions need to be adjusted, it must be approved by the State Council. However, when the following three conditions are met, the provincial and autonomous region people's committees may make their own adjustments within a limit not exceeding 3% of the originally set total grain revenue plan and report to the State Council for record:

1. Ensure the state's allocation plan, that is, provinces and autonomous regions that transfer grain out will not reduce the transfer-out figures, and provinces and autonomous regions that transfer grain in will not increase the transfer-in figures;
2. Ensure the necessary grain supply for the province or autonomous region;
3. Ensure the state's planned inventory, that is, the decrease in revenue is not greater than the decrease in sales, or the increase in revenue is not less than the increase in sales.

Article 35: The provincial and autonomous region people's committees may reserve a discretionary supply of grain within a limit not exceeding 3% of the verified total grain sales plan.

Chapter VI Appeals and Rewards and Punishments

Article 36: If farmers believe that the verified grain yield, grain sales tasks, and grain supply amount are unfair or involve favoritism and malpractice, they may lodge an appeal to the state authorities. The state authorities accepting the appeal must be responsible for handling it promptly. However, before a new decision is made, farmers should still implement the original decision.

Article 37: In the rural grain purchase and sales work, state personnel who have made significant achievements should be commended or rewarded; those who neglect their duties or violate the law should be dealt with according to law. Farmers who assist in handling the rural grain purchase and sales work and have made outstanding achievements should be commended or rewarded; those who undermine the unified purchase and sale of grain in rural areas should be dealt with according to law.

Chapter VII Supplementary Provisions

Article 38: The rural grain purchase and sales certificates, forms, and their usage and management methods shall be separately determined by the Ministry of Food.

Article 39: Grain purchase and sales for the agricultural population in urban areas shall be subject to these measures. These measures do not apply to areas that have not implemented unified grain purchase and sales. In areas that implement unified grain purchase and sales, special circumstances of ethnic minorities should be taken care of.

Article 40: The people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and directly administered municipality shall formulate detailed rules for implementation based on these measures, issue them for implementation, and report them to the State Council for record.

Article 41: These measures shall be issued and implemented by the State Council; the same applies to their modification.

    农村粮食统购统销暂行办法
    第一章　总　则
    第一条　为贯彻粮食统购统销政策，实现农村粮食统购统销的制度化，进一步提高农民生产积极性，增加粮食生产，提倡粮食节约，保证国家和人民对粮食的需要，以利于社会主义建设，特制定农村粮食统购统销暂行办法。
    第二条　农村粮食统购统销，应分别核定每户农民的粮食产量，分别规定各类农户和不生产粮食的农村居民的用粮标准，按户计算用粮量；凡生产粮食的农户，按照核定的粮食产量，减去用粮量和实缴公粮后，粮食有余的为余粮户，不余不缺的为自足户，不足的为缺粮户，不生产粮食的农村居民也为缺粮户；国家对余粮户分别核定粮食交售任务进行统购，对缺粮户分别核定粮食供应量进行统销，对自足户不进行统购统销。核定粮食产量和计算用粮量，应按粮田面积、常年在家人口和喂粮牲畜头数计算。
    第三条　核定农户的粮食产量、余粮户的粮食交售任务和缺粮户的粮食供应量，必须根据一九五五年春耕前后分配到乡的粮食定产、定购、定销数字，结合实际情况，由乡人民委员会充分发动群众，深入讨论，划分余粮户、自足户、缺粮户，一次评定全年粮食的产量、交售任务和供应量，经乡人民代表大会通过后，造具清册，报县级人民委员会或其指定机关核定。
    第四条　一九五五年分户核定的余粮户粮食交售任务，在正常的情况下，自一九五五年起，三年不变，增产不增购；缺粮户的粮食供应量，每年核定一次。余粮户完成国家核定的粮食交售任务是应尽的光荣义务。生产粮食的缺粮户，应努力生产，争取粮食自足以至有余。
    第五条　粮食的定产、定购、定销，个体农民和互助组应以户为单位；农业生产合作社可以社为单位，也可以户为单位。以社为单位进行粮食定产、定购、定销的农业生产合作社，其具体办法应根据既能照顾农业生产合作社的发展，又能保证完成国家粮食统购任务的原则，由各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会规定。
    第六条　余粮户完成粮食交售任务后剩余的粮食，自足户因增产节约多余的粮食，都有权自由处理；可以自由存贮，可以自由使用，可以继续售给国家或合作社，可以在国家粮食市场进行交易，可以在农户间互通有无，都不加干涉。但禁止任何人以粮食进行投机。
    第七条　农民因经济周转或品种调剂的需要，将自用的粮食按粮食统购价格卖给国家，俟后又要买回的，国家应予收购，并发给周转粮证，准其以后按粮食统销价格凭证买回。但不鼓励农民出售周转粮。周转粮应与统购、统销粮分别统计。
    第八条　在新粮收获后至粮食统购工作结束前，统购的粮食品种只能卖给国家，不准卖给私人；对非统购的粮食品种，允许随时进入国家粮食市场交易，不加限制。粮食统购任务完成后，县级人民委员会应正式宣布粮食统购工作结束，允许统购的粮食品种进入国家粮食市场交易，开展国家粮食市场工作。在国家粮食市场进行粮食交易的买方、卖方都不要任何凭证，但对粮食投机者必须严加取缔。
    第二章　定产
    第九条　农户的粮食产量，应按粮田的单位面积常年产量归户计算。农户粮田的单位面积常年产量，应以一九五五年春耕前后初步定产到乡的数字为基础，根据田地质量和自然条件，结合农户的经营条件评定。凡一九五五年收成正常的粮田，应按实际产量评定其单位面积常年产量；一九五五年特别丰收或歉收的粮田，其单位面积常年产量应按正常年景的产量评定。凡一九五四年已评定粮田单位面积产量的地区，如所定产量与一九五五年实际产量大体相符，可以既定产量为基础，适当调整偏高偏低的部分，核定常年产量。
    第十条　一九五五年核定的粮田单位面积常年产量，自一九五五年起，三年不变。生产粮食的缺粮户，应以核定的常年产量为基数，加每年计划增产指标，作为当年产量。在正常年景，缺粮户实际增产数大于计划增产指标的，不再多计。为鼓励种植技术作物的缺粮农户按国家计划种植技术作物，其粮田在核定单位面积常年产量后，三年内不计增产指标。
    第十一条　薯类作物一般应计算产量，可以根据既能适当鼓励薯类生产又不影响国家粮食统购任务的原则，将薯类产量按一定比率折算粮食。折算办法由各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会规定。
    第十二条　在定产以后，新垦荒地，自开始收获之年起，三年不计产量。利用田埂、场地、宅基空地生产的粮食，可不计算产量。
    第三章　定　购
    第十三条　农户用粮量，一般应包括种子、口粮、饲料三项用粮（向来不以粮食作饲料的地区不包括饲料）。各项用粮标准，由各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会按如下原则规定：一、种子用粮标准，应根据实际需要规定；二、口粮、饲料用粮标准，应根据各地现有的一般消费水平规定；凡一九五四年已定用粮标准的地区，应以既定标准为基础，调整偏高偏低的部分；三、用粮标准可按种子、口粮、饲料分别规定，也可按人规定一个统一的免购额；四、在生产薯类的地区，应根据当地消费习惯，规定薯类占口粮和饲料用粮量的适当比例。
    第十四条　国家向余粮户统购粮食，一般应占其余粮数量的百分之八十至九十；按单一比例规定购率，不累进；对富农余粮的购率应适当提高。具体购率，由各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会规定。
    第十五条　国营农场和地方国营农场生产的粮食，除按规定的用粮标准留下必需的用粮外，所有余粮应全部卖给国家。国营农场和地方国营农场的用粮标准，由各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会规定。
    第十六条　粮食统购，在一年一熟地区，应全年一次进行；在一年多于一熟的地区，应全年统一计算，根据夏秋粮食产量，确定夏秋统购比例，分两次进行，夏季粮食统购数字到秋粮统购时统一结算。为适应国家需要，在统购开始前，可以动员农民提前交售一部分粮食；农民自动提前交售的，只要质量合格，也应照收，抵算粮食交售任务。
    第十七条　统购的粮食品种，一般应以谷物和黄豆为主，也可收购一部分小杂粮。在薯类折粮计产的地区，可以根据供应需要和保管条件，酌购一部分薯类。
    第十八条　统购粮食的质量，应根据利于安全保管并保证一定成品率的原则，由各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会按历年情况，参照当年粮食干、净、饱满程度，规定中等质量标准。农民向国家交售的粮食，应晒干、颺净，符合规定标准。基层粮站应根据国家牌价和规定标准，依质论价。
    第十九条　农民交售粮食的地点，应根据粮食流转方向和交通、仓库条件，结合当地供应需要，并照顾农民交售的方便，加以规定。当地供应所需的粮食，应就地保管。
    第四章　定　销
    第二十条　各类缺粮户用粮标准，由各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会按如下原则规定：一、种子用粮标准，应根据实际需要规定；二、一般粮产区的缺粮户口粮、饲料用粮标准，应稍低于当地余粮户的用粮标准；三、按照国家计划种植技术作物的缺粮户口粮、饲料用粮标准，应不低于当地余粮户的用粮标准；四、灾区的缺粮户口粮、饲料用粮标准，应低于当地正常年景缺粮户的用粮标准；五、农村的非农业人口口粮、饲料用粮标准，一般不应超过当地余粮户的用粮标准。
    第二十一条　农村工商行业用粮的供应，由各省、自治区人民委员会参照市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法自行规定。
    第二十二条　供应缺粮户的粮食品种，可以根据国家在当地有什么供应什么的原则进行供应，并可以供应部分薯类。但国家粮食机关应尽力组织调剂，适当照顾群众需要。
    第二十三条　对缺粮户的粮食供应，应根据何时缺粮何时供应的原则，分别评定各户开始供应的时间和分月供应计划，缺粮户不能提前购买，但国家可以提前供应薯类。
    第二十四条　缺粮户粮食供应量和分月供应计划核定后，由国家粮食机关规定购粮地点，并填发农村缺粮户粮食供应证。农村缺粮户粮食供应证上规定的供应数量、时间、地点，缺粮户买粮和粮站供应粮食都必须严格遵守。
    第二十五条　农村居民外出时，如系缺粮户，可凭农村缺粮户粮食供应证，向指定的粮站在规定的供应量内领取粮票；如系余粮户或自足户，则可自带粮食或将粮食卖给国家粮站或粮站指定的代理人，换取粮票。
    第二十六条农村居民迁居外地的，应凭户口转移证件至国家粮站办理粮食供应的转移手续。如系缺粮户，应凭农村缺粮户粮食供应证向国家粮站换取粮食供应转移证；如系余粮户或自足户，可将剩余粮食卖给国家粮站，领取粮食供应转移证。
    第五章　产、购、销数字的调整
    第二十七条　核定农村居民的粮食购销数字时，对鳏、寡、孤、独、复员军人和由于其它特殊原因需要减少粮食交售任务或增加粮食供应量的，可予适当照顾。照顾办法由各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会规定。
    第二十八条　农户的粮食产、购、销数字核定后，因自然情况发生重大变化而显著影响收成时，乡人民委员会应根据歉收户的歉收情况，调整其原定的粮食交售任务或粮食供应量；缺粮户丰收时，应根据其丰收情况，适当核减其原定的粮食供应量；以上调整数字，都由乡人民委员会报县级人民委员会批准，并由县级人民委员会报省、自治区人民委员会备案。前款调整的结果，在省、自治区范围内不能保证原定收销差额时，省、自治区人民委员会可在丰收地区酌量增购；增购结果如仍不能保证原定收销差额时，应提出意见报国务院决定。在一省、自治区或数省发生严重灾害，影响国家粮食收销计划不能平衡时，国务院可指定丰收的省、自治区酌量增购。因购销数字的调整，必须向丰收地区增购粮食时，增购数字不应超过农户因丰收而增产部分的百分之四十。
    第二十九条　农户的粮食购销数字核定后，自一九五五年起，在三年之内，一般不因婴儿出生、死亡和牲畜的增减，调整原定数字；但因婚嫁、死亡、外出、回家等人口变动和喂粮耕畜的增减，致原定用粮量发生显著不足或有余时，可于次年统购时计算调整。
    第三十条　农户的粮食产、购、销数字核定后，粮田增减转移时，都按增减转移的粮田的原定产量调整有关农户的粮食产、购、销数字。
    第三十一条　农户的粮食购销数字核定后，实缴公粮如有增减，应等量增减原定粮食购销数字。
    第三十二条　因粮食产、购、销数字的调整，缺粮户、自足户变成余粮户时，应按余粮户计算粮食交售任务；余粮户、自足户变成缺粮户时，应按缺粮户计算粮食供应量。
    第三十三条　粮食的产、购、销数字核定后，由于个体农户参加农业生产合作社或农业生产合作社社员退社而引起的粮食产、购、销数字的调整办法，由各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会规定。
    第三十四条　在年景正常的情况下，省、自治区原定的粮食收销数字，如需调整，须经国务院批准；但具备下列三个条件时，省、自治区人民委员会可在不超过原定粮食收入计划总额百分之三的限度内自行调整，并报国务院备案：
    一、保证国家调拨计划，即调出省、自治区不减少调出数字，调入省、自治区不增加调入数字；
    二、保证本省、自治区必需的粮食供应；
    三、保证国家计划库存，即收入减少数不大于销售减少数，或收入增加数不小于销售增加数。
    第三十五条　省、自治区人民委员会可在不超过核定的粮食销售计划总额百分之三的限度内酌留供应机动粮。
