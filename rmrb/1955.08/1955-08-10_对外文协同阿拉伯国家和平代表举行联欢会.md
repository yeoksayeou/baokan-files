After tracing the long-standing friendly and cultural ties between China and various Arab countries, he pointed out that the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China have provided new and favorable conditions for the friendly relations and economic and cultural ties between the Chinese people and the Arab people. Chu Tunan concluded by wishing the continuous development of friendship and cultural exchange between the Chinese people and the people of various Arab countries.
    Iraqi peace representative Munier, on behalf of the Arab countries' representatives, thanked them for their hospitality, saying: Your kindness is inseparable from the Chinese people's love of peace and your commitment to the great construction of the transition to socialism.

We should now restore and develop this old relationship. Munier, after talking about the mutual sympathy and support between the Chinese people and the people of various Arab countries, shouted "Long live world peace," "Long live the friendship of the people of all countries in the world," and "Long live the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of various Arab countries."

    新华社九日讯　中国人民对外文化协会为了欢迎正在中国访问的五个阿拉伯国家的和平使者，在九日举行了联欢晚会。会长楚图南在会上向各国和平代表说：“我们之间的历史悠久的传统友谊已开始进入一个新的阶段”，他祝贺中国人民和阿拉伯各国人民之间的友谊和文化交流将不断发展。
    来自叙利亚、伊拉克、黎巴嫩、约旦、苏丹五个国家的和平代表在新疆和上海访问后，在九日中午才乘飞机回到北京，但他们都兴致勃勃地来参加了这次联欢晚会。代表们同中国的和平工作者、工会工作者、妇女工作者、法学家、农业学家、新闻工作者、宗教界人士分别围桌而坐，进行了亲切的谈话。中国人民外交学会会长张奚若、中国伊斯兰教协会副主任杨静仁并为两位和平代表佩上了北京出产的精巧的白色和平鸽。
    楚图南在联欢晚会开始时致词欢迎阿拉伯各国和平代表，他在追溯了中国和阿拉伯各国之间的悠久的友好和文化联系后指出，中国人民革命的胜利，中华人民共和国的成立，使中国人民和阿拉伯人民之间的友好关系和经济、文化联系获得了新的有利条件。楚图南最后祝中国人民和阿拉伯各国人民之间的友谊和文化交流不断发展。
    伊拉克和平代表穆尼埃代表阿拉伯各国代表感谢对他们的盛情款待，他说：你们的这种盛情厚意和中国人民的热爱和平是分不开的，和你们致力于向社会主义过渡的伟大建设是分不开的。穆尼埃说：中国和阿拉伯国家有着悠久的文化经济关系，但这种关系被帝国主义者割断了，我们现在应该恢复这种旧有的关系并加以发展。穆尼埃在谈到中国人民和阿拉伯各国人民的互相同情和支持以后，高呼“世界和平万岁”，“全世界各国人民的友谊万岁”和“中国和阿拉伯各国人民的友谊万岁”。
    在联欢晚会进行中，首都的国乐家、歌唱家为来宾们演奏了琵琶、二胡和笛子等中国乐器，演唱了几支中国民歌。叙利亚和平代表穆斯塔法·贾拉布也在会上唱了一支阿拉伯古典歌曲。每一个节目都受到热烈欢迎。
