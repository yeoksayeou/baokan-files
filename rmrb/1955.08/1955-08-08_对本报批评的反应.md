    Response to Criticism from This Newspaper
    According to a letter from Zhejiang University: Following the March 21st editorial in this newspaper, "Everyone Must Conserve Food Grain," which criticized Zhejiang University for wasting food grain, the leadership of Zhejiang University conducted an inspection of the university's food consumption situation. They used the facts of food waste discovered during the inspection to educate all students, faculty, and staff. Based on heightened ideological awareness, students, faculty, and staff voluntarily proposed guaranteeing that not a single grain of food would be wasted and formulated a public pledge for conserving food in the dining halls. The staff and workers responsible for managing meals also conducted special research on grain purchasing, warehousing, rice washing, cooking, and serving, and formulated work regulations. Because all students, faculty, and staff have paid attention to conserving food, the amount of food wasted has been greatly reduced in recent months. According to inspections, on April 5th, 2,600 people eating one meal wasted a total of 48 taels of rice; by May 3rd, this had been reduced to 12 taels; and on June 9th, the inspection showed only 1.5 taels. Currently, Zhejiang University's food consumption is still relatively high, and the school leadership is actively studying further improvements to the food management methods in order to strive to conserve more food grain.

    对本报批评的反应
    据浙江大学来信：三月二十一日本报“人人都要节约粮食”的社论内，批评浙江大学浪费粮食后，浙江大学领导方面已对全校用粮情况进行了检查，并用检查发现的浪费粮食的事实向全校学生和教职员工进行了教育。在思想觉悟提高的基础上，学生和教职员工自觉地提出保证不浪费一粒粮食，并制定了膳厅节约粮食的公约。办理伙食的工作人员和工人还特别就购粮、入库、淘米、煮饭、打饭等工作进行了研究，制定了工作制度。由于全校学生和教职员工重视了节约粮食，几个月来浪费粮食的数量已大为减少。根据检查，四月五日二千六百人吃一顿饭共撒饭四十八两，五月三日已减为十二两，六月九日检查，只有一两半了。目前浙江大学粮食消耗量还相当大，学校领导方面正积极研究进一步改进伙食管理办法，争取节约更多的粮食。
