Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions

A letter from the Third Hospital of the Central Direct Organs of the Ministry of Health: The facts stated in the "Reader's Letters" page on July 10 regarding Dr. Jia Mengdong of our hospital concealing his mistakes, which led to the death of Chen Wanling, are accurate. Our hospital is determined to learn from this lesson and has already inspected the medical ethics of our medical personnel and the bureaucratic tendencies of our leadership through this incident.
　　
Jia Mengdong was arrested and prosecuted by the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate on the evening of July 9.
　　
A letter from the Qiqihar Municipal Grain Bureau: The criticism in the "Reader's Letters" page on June 19 regarding the more than 160,000 jin of rice bran that was blown away at our office is correct. We acknowledge our mistake of lacking a sense of responsibility towards state property and have actively improved our supply and processing management, ensuring the timely handling of by-products.
　　
A letter from the General Office of the Jilin Provincial Grain Department: The criticism in the "Reader's Letters" page on July 10 regarding our department's backlog of documents is correct. The main reasons for this backlog were the unsound system of the secretarial department and the lack of responsibility of individual personnel. The personnel involved have now conducted self-criticisms and examinations. The leadership of the Grain Department has also taken measures to improve the work.
　　
A letter from the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China: The People's Daily published a letter of criticism on May 9 titled "The Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China Should Seriously Handle Guo Jie's Mistake of Suppressing Criticism." After our Disciplinary Inspection Committee investigated, it proved that the reader's report was factual. The Tie Dong District Committee of Anshan City decided to give Guo Jie a disciplinary sanction of removal from his post within the Party and recommended that appropriate administrative sanctions be given. We agree with the District Committee's opinion and plan to publish the relevant materials regarding Guo Jie's issue in the "Anshan Worker's Life Daily."
　　
In the past, certain organizations affiliated with the Anshan Municipal Committee took an irresponsible and accommodating approach to handling Guo Jie's issue, which resulted in the problem dragging on for more than eight months without being resolved, and we also failed to urge the relevant units to deal with it promptly. We are determined to earnestly improve our work style.
　　
After the "Reader's Letters" page published a letter of criticism on July 17 entitled "Unnecessary Memorial Pavilion," the Shenyang Municipal Urban Construction Bureau and the Shenyang Municipal Volunteer Labor Steering Committee both sent letters expressing their acceptance of the criticism and decided to cancel the plan to build the memorial pavilion, using the funds instead to repay the Shenyang Municipal Urban Construction Bureau Engineering Company for the tools allocated to them.

A letter from the Luoyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Henan Province: The criticism in the "Reader's Letters" page on July 10 regarding our Commercial Section drawing personnel from state-owned enterprise departments to help with work for a long time is in accordance with the facts. To date, the Commercial Section has drawn a total of eight personnel from various companies. We are prepared to correct this unreasonable practice.

    批评建议的反应
    卫生部中央直属机关第三医院来信：七月十日“读者来信专页”发表的关于我院医生贾孟冬隐瞒错误害死陈万玲的事实是确实的。我院决心接受这个教训，已经通过这个事件检查了医务人员的医疗作风和领导人员的官僚主义。
    贾孟冬已在七月九日晚被北京市人民检察院逮捕法办。
    齐齐哈尔市粮食局来信：六月十九日“读者来信专页”对我处十六万多斤谷糠被风吹走的批评是正确的。我们检讨对国家财产缺乏负责精神的错误，并已积极改进供应和加工管理工作，对副产品做到及时处理。
    吉林省粮食厅办公室来信：七月十日“读者来信专页”对我厅积压文件的批评是正确的。造成这次文件积压的主要原因是秘书部门制度不健全和个别人员工作不负责任。现在有关人员已作了检查和检讨。粮食厅领导方面也已采取了改进工作的措施。
    中共鞍山市委会来信：五月九日人民日报发表了“中共鞍山市委员会应该严肃处理郭杰压制批评的错误”的批评信。经我们责成市委纪律检查委员会检查，证明读者反映的情况是属实的。鞍山市铁东区委决定给郭杰以党内撤销工作处分，并建议行政上给予适当处分。我们同意区委意见，并拟将有关郭杰问题的材料在“鞍山工人生活报”发表。
    鞍山市委所属的某些组织过去对郭杰问题的处理采取了不负责任和迁就的错误态度，致使问题拖了八个多月的时间没有解决，我们也没有抓紧督促有关单位处理。我们决心认真改进工作作风。
    七月十七日本报“读者来信专页”发表了“毫无必要的纪念亭”的批评信后，沈阳市城市建设局和沈阳市义务劳动指导委员会都来信表示接受批评，决定取消修纪念亭的计划，把这笔经费做为偿还沈阳市城市建设局工程公司所拨工具的经费。
    河南省洛阳专署来信：七月十日“读者来信专页”对我署商业科抽调国营企业部门的工作人员长期帮助工作的批评是符合事实的。到目前为止，商业科先后抽用各公司工作人员八人。我们准备纠正这种不合理的作法。
