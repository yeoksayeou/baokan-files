The Unyielding People
—Watching the Korean Film "The Partisan Girl"
　  Screenplay: Feng Ming; Director: Kim Seung-gu; Director: Yoon Ryong-kyu; Produced by the Korean National Film Studio; Translated by Changchun Film Studio
    In Korea, the sound of gunfire has ceased for over two years. The Korean people are rebuilding homes on the ruins, planting trees, and dedicating themselves to peaceful construction. However, they have not forgotten those harsh days spent under fire, nor have they forgotten the heroic and unyielding people in the battles. They want to use the arduous struggles of those days and the shining examples of those heroes to inspire themselves and educate future generations.
    The film "The Partisan Girl," produced by the Korean National Film Studio after its recovery from the ruins, is a eulogy to those sacrificed, unyielding heroes, and a march to inspire people to defend the victories already won and continue to fight for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
    "The Partisan Girl" depicts the struggle during the most difficult period of the Korean people's anti-aggression war. In September 1950, American invaders, with superior forces, landed at Inchon and advanced north. Due to the disparity in strength between the enemy and our forces, the Korean People's Army had to implement a temporary strategic retreat. Large swathes of the young republic's land were soaked in blood by the enemy. People still remember MacArthur's frantic ranting: to reach the Yalu and Tumen Rivers before Christmas. History has long concluded this "Christmas Offensive," but the test faced by the Korean people at that time was incomparably cruel. The film opens by reproducing the scene at that time: enemy planes roar across the sky, the flames of bombs, burning houses. The enemy occupied a small town, and they immediately began a massive search for revolutionaries. They tied the captured people to pillars and poured cold water on the sufferers in the heavy snow; they shot innocent children... They妄想(wangxiang - presumptuously hoped) to use slaughter and torture to intimidate the people, to establish a colonizer's bayonet order in a place where the people had once held power. However, the people answered them with eyes flashing with deep-seated hatred. People firmly believed that the Workers' Party, which had led them to establish a democratic government, would not abandon them, but would come to lead them in the struggle.
    The Party did not abandon the masses. The bridge leading to the front line was destroyed. That huge explosion told people that the Workers' Party-led guerrillas were nearby. Then, the Party sent a young girl from the guerrillas to the enemy-occupied areas to lead the masses in the struggle.
    In this young girl, the female guerrilla fighter Kim Young-sook, we see the heroic image of Korean women who shared all the sufferings and trials of the Korean people. She belongs to the young and happy generation nurtured by the Workers' Party. If the invaders had not launched the war, she, along with millions of others, would have wholeheartedly devoted herself to the construction of a new life under the guidance of the Party. However, the war destroyed the new life they had built, and the enemy's bombs took her mother. Her experience is the common experience of millions of Korean people, and what she says, "We should be stronger in times of sorrow," also represents the will of millions of Korean people.
    The film portrays her activities from many aspects, demonstrating her heroic qualities of bravery, steadfastness, and loyalty. When she sneaks into the town occupied by the enemy alone, when she sees the compatriots suffering bound to wooden stakes, when she sees the children shot, we see the burning hatred in her eyes. When she raises a stone and smashes it at the American robber who snatched the child's scarf, we see the power condensed by this hatred. However, her activities among the enemies are not just a lone battle relying on individual bravery and strength. Her strength is expressed on the basis of the strength of the masses' struggle. She relies on the masses, connects with the masses, inspires their fighting spirit, and organizes them to fight. Through organizing the masses to sabotage and delay the repair of bridges to hinder the enemy's transportation of military supplies, through the touching scenes where she safely escapes under the cover of the masses during the enemy's search, through the depiction of Kim Young-sook's activities, the film profoundly shows the flesh-and-blood connection between the Party, the guerrillas, and the masses. The people, who had once gained democratic rights and built a new life on their own land, understand what true freedom and happiness are. The enemy's brutality can only arouse their resentment and will not make them submit. The unyielding people nurtured unyielding heroic sons and daughters. Millions of brave and unyielding people resisting aggression formed an indestructible iron wall.
    The heroine in the film shares the fate of the masses and is closely related to them. Around Kim Young-sook, we see many images of patriots. From those who risked their lives to protect her, those who helped her put up leaflets and pass messages, those who helped her organize the masses and inspire them to fight, we specifically see the power of the people.
    Choi Wan-soo, the old man who endured the misunderstanding of the masses, seemingly worked for the enemy on the surface, but actually helped the guerrillas with his courage and wit, when his contact with the guerrillas was discovered, and he was taken to the torture chamber to meet Kim Young-sook, that scene is touching. The enemy is cunning and cruel. They wanted him to whip the Kim Young-sook he respected, to prove that he had no connection with the guerrillas. He took the whip and said calmly, "Using this thing, it doesn't hurt even if you hit it, change it!" He grabbed a thick wooden stick and slammed it at the American robber next to him. Gunshots rang out. Choi Wan-soo fell down. However, the power of hatred contained in his action of raising the wooden stick and striking it suddenly left the audience with such a deep impression!
    The film's depiction of Kim Young-sook's dignified and unyielding image after being wounded and captured is also full of power to inspire people. The scenes of her facing the enemy's interrogation are a battle of bravery and brutality, humanity and bestiality. Whips, red-hot branding irons, and even the "scientific" method of passing electricity through the water could not subdue this strong girl. The enemy became anxious and furious in front of her. The robbers would not understand the source of Kim Young-sook's strength, her beliefs, and her love and yearning for a truly happy and free life. They futilely used the lie of "guaranteeing your life and beautiful future" to induce her to surrender. But the answer they got was: "After we wipe you out, we can live a truly happy life!" Yes, the people's true happiness and freedom are incompatible with the aggressors' "guns and whips."
    In the war, many unyielding people sacrificed themselves heroically. But they did not die, they live, they live in the hearts of the people. The shining images of Kim Young-sook, Choi Wan-soo and others created in the film "The Partisan Girl" are the common statues of those unyielding people who gave their lives for the happiness of the people. People remember them. Their heroic example will always inspire and encourage people to fight bravely and work diligently for the beautiful future of mankind.
    We, the Chinese people, who once fought side by side with the Korean people and jointly attacked the aggressors, deeply understand the sacrifices and costs paid by the Korean people in the struggle against imperialist aggression, and also deeply understand the significance of the contributions made by those unyielding people who sacrificed their lives in the battles to the peace of the Far East and the world, and to the security of our country. We are equally proud of those unyielding Korean heroes and heroines depicted in the film. From them, we have also received great inspiration and encouragement.

    坚贞不屈的人们
    ——看朝鲜影片“游击队的姑娘”
　  冯明编剧：金承久　导演：尹龙奎　朝鲜国立电影制片厂出品　长春电影制片厂译制
    在朝鲜，炮声已经停息了两年多。朝鲜人民正在废墟上重建房屋，栽种树木，致力于和平建设。但是，他们并没有忘记在炮火下度过的那些严峻的日子，没有忘记在战斗中英勇不屈的人们。他们要用那些日子里的艰苦斗争和那些英雄们的光辉榜样，来激厉自己和教育后代。
    朝鲜国立电影制片厂从残垣断壁中恢复起来以后所拍制的影片“游击队的姑娘”，就是纪念那些牺牲了的坚贞不屈的英雄们的颂歌，也是激厉人们保卫已经争得的胜利，继续为争取祖国的和平统一而斗争的进行曲。
    “游击队的姑娘”所描写的是朝鲜人民反侵略战争最艰苦时期的斗争。一九五○年九月，美国侵略者以优势兵力，在仁川登陆，向北进犯。由于敌我力量的悬殊，朝鲜人民军不得不实行暂时的战略退却。年青的共和国的大片土地被敌人浸在血泊里。人们都还记得麦克阿瑟的疯狂的叫嚣：圣诞节以前打到鸭绿江边和图们江边。历史早已给这次“圣诞节攻势”作出了结论，但是当时朝鲜人民所面对的考验，却是无比残酷的。影片一开始就再现了当时的情景：敌机轰轰然掠过天空，炸弹的火光，燃烧着的房屋。敌人侵占了一个小城镇，他们马上开始了对革命者的大搜捕。他们把捉来的人绑到柱子上，在大风雪中向受难者身上浇冷水；他们开枪射击天真的孩子……。他们妄想用屠杀和酷刑吓住人民，在这人民曾经掌握过政权的地方建立起殖民者的刺刀秩序。但是，人民回答他们的却是闪露着刻骨仇恨的眼光。人们坚信，曾经领导他们建立起了民主政权的劳动党不会离开他们，会来领导他们进行斗争。
    党是没有离开人民群众的。通往前线的大桥被炸毁了。那一声巨大的爆炸声告诉了人们：劳动党领导的游击队就在他们的近旁。接着，党又从游击队里派了一位年青的姑娘到敌占区去领导群众进行斗争。
    我们在这个年青姑娘、女游击队员金英淑的身上，看到了分担着朝鲜人民一切苦难和考验的朝鲜妇女的英雄形象。她属于劳动党教养出来的年青幸福的一代。如果不是侵略者发动了战争，她将和千百万人一道，在党的指引下，全心全意地投入新生活的建设。然而，战争破坏了他们建设起来的新的生活，敌人的炸弹夺去了她的母亲。她的遭遇，是千百万朝鲜人民的共同遭遇，她所说的“悲痛的时候，更应当坚强”，也是代表了千百万朝鲜人民的意志的。
    影片多方面地描写了她的活动，表现了她的英勇、坚定、忠贞的英雄品质。她只身潜入敌人侵占下的城镇，看到被绑在木桩上受难的同胞，看到被枪杀的孩子的时候，我们从她的眼睛里看到了燃烧着的仇恨。她举起石头砸向那个抢劫孩子的围巾的美国强盗的时候，我们看到了这仇恨所凝成的力量。但是她在敌人中间的活动，却不是光凭个人的英勇和力量的孤军奋战。她的力量是在群众斗争的力量的基础上表现出来的。她依靠群众，联系群众，鼓舞他们的斗志，组织他们起来斗争。通过组织群众破坏和拖延修复桥梁，以阻碍敌人运输军火的那些活动，通过在敌人的搜捕中，在群众的掩护下得以安全脱险的那些感人的场面，通过对于金英淑的这些活动的描写，影片深刻地显示了党、游击队和人民群众的血肉联系。人民，曾经获得民主权利，在自己的土地上建设起新生活的人民，懂得什么是真正的自由和幸福。敌人的残暴，只能激起他们的愤恨，而不会使他们屈服。不屈的人民，养育了不屈的英雄儿女。千百万反抗侵略的英勇不屈的人民结成了不可摧毁的铜墙铁壁。
    影片中的女英雄是和人民群众命运与共、息息相关的，我们在金英淑的周围，看到了许多爱国者的形象。从那些舍命掩护她的人们，那些帮助她贴传单、传消息的人们，那些帮助她组织群众、鼓舞群众斗争的人们身上，我们具体地看到了人民的力量。
    崔万寿，那个忍受着群众的误解、表面上为敌人工作、而实际上却是用他的勇敢和机智帮助游击队活动的老人，当他和游击队的联系被发觉以后，被带到拷问室里和金英淑会面，那个场面是感动人的。敌人狡黠而又残忍。他们要他鞭打他所敬重的金英淑，以证明他和游击队没有联系。他接过了鞭子，平静地说：“用这个东西，打在身上也不疼，换一个吧！”他抄起粗大的木棒，猛然朝旁边的美国强盗砸下去。枪声响了。崔万寿倒下去了。然而他举起木棒猛然一击的动作里所蕴含的憎恨的力量，给了观众多么深刻的印象呵！
    影片所描写的金英淑负伤被捕后的凛然不屈的形象，也是富有激厉人们的力量的。她面对敌人拷问的那些场面，是勇敢和残暴、人性和兽性的搏斗。皮鞭、烧红的烙铁以至在水里通上电流的“科学”方法，都不能使这个坚强的姑娘屈服。敌人在她面前焦躁，暴跳。对于金英淑的坚强不屈的力量的泉源，对于她所怀抱的信念和对真正幸福自由的生活的热爱和向往，强盗们是不会理解的。他们枉费心机地用什么“保证你的生命和美满的将来”的鬼话来诱降。但是他们得到的回答却是：“把你们消灭干净后，我们就能过真正幸福的日子！”是的，人民的真正的幸福和自由，是和侵略者的“枪杆和皮鞭”势不两立的。
    在战争中，许多坚贞不屈的人们英勇地牺牲了。但是他们并没有死，他们活着，活在人民的心里。影片“游击队的姑娘”所创造的金英淑、崔万寿等人的光辉形象，就是那些为人民的幸福献出了生命的坚贞不屈的人们的共同的塑像。人们记着他们。他们的英勇榜样将永远激厉鼓舞人们去为人类美好的未来英勇地斗争，辛勤地劳动。
    我们，曾经和朝鲜人民并肩作战、共同打击侵略者的中国人民，深刻地理解朝鲜人民在反抗帝国主义侵略的斗争中所付出的牺牲和代价，也深刻地理解那些在战斗中献出了生命的坚贞不屈的人们对远东和世界的和平，对我国的安全所作的贡献的意义。对于影片里所描写的那些坚贞不屈的朝鲜的英雄儿女，我们同样引为骄傲。从他们身上，我们同样得到了很大的激厉和鼓舞。
