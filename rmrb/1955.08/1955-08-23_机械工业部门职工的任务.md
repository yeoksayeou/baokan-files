The First National Congress of the Mechanical and Engineering Workers' Union of China has concluded, summarizing the work of the Union from 1950 to the present, discussing and determining the Union's work guidelines and tasks during the First Five-Year Plan, and electing the Union's national leadership.

This congress determined that the Union must closely coordinate with administrative work, strengthen ties with the masses of workers, raise the level of awareness and organization of the workers, organize the workers to master new technologies, extensively and deeply carry out labor competitions, strive to increase production, practice strict economy, to ensure the completion and strive to overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan; and, on the basis of developing production, gradually improve the material and cultural life of the workers, and strive to gradually realize the country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. Based on the situation and characteristics of the mechanical industry, the congress determined the general goal of labor competition, requiring the use of diverse forms of competition to attract more workers, technicians, and staff to participate; and emphasized the need to master new technologies, ensure the trial production of new products, complete product variety plans, ensure product quality, reduce waste, and save metal. The congress also emphasized the need to strengthen the work of trade unions in capitalist mechanical enterprises, to lay the foundation for the socialist transformation of private mechanical industries. This congress has yielded important results.

The basic task of our country's First Five-Year Plan is to lay a preliminary foundation for the complete realization of the general task of our transition period. To this end, we must concentrate our efforts on giving priority to the development of heavy industry. As the core of heavy industry and providing technical equipment to various sectors of the national economy, the mechanical industry bears an important task in the struggle to complete the Five-Year Plan. Although China's mechanical industry has made considerable progress in recent years under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, with the assistance of the Soviet Union and the efforts of all employees, the level of the mechanical industry is still lagging behind the needs of the country due to the development of national construction.

As stated in the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:

"Developing heavy industry and its core—the mechanical industry—is the foundation of the country's socialist industrialization. In recent years, China's mechanical industry has made great progress, and has successfully trial-produced many new products that could not be manufactured in the past. However, it should also be pointed out that many problems still exist in our mechanical industry—poor product quality, unsatisfactory trial production of new products, serious waste, and many new technical equipment that cannot be well mastered, etc. Workers, engineers, technicians, and staff of the national mechanical industry must make further efforts to gradually change this situation to meet the needs of national economic construction." The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China calls on "the congress to further strengthen the ties between the trade union and the masses, further raise the political awareness of the workers and staff, promote the working class's fine tradition of hard work and struggle, practice comprehensive economy, strengthen labor discipline, strive to learn from advanced Soviet experience, master new technologies, promote the effective advanced experience of our country, carry out mass rationalization proposals, give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of all employees in the mechanical industry sector, push the labor competition to a new high tide, and continuously improve labor productivity, and strive to victoriously complete the glorious task of the First Five-Year Plan that you bear."

In order to accomplish this major task, all employees in the mechanical industry sector must strive to overcome the existing shortcomings of the mechanical industry. The main shortcomings of the mechanical industry at present are: poor planning and organization of work, backward technology, and great waste. Whether these three shortcomings can be overcome will be the key to whether the mechanical industry sector can complete the Five-Year Plan.

In 1953, the mechanical industry once strengthened planning management with the work schedule as the center, and in 1954 it carried out the work of planning production technology preparation. These efforts have achieved certain results. However, the improvement of management in various enterprises is extremely uneven. At present, with the exception of a few enterprises that are managed relatively well, most enterprises cannot carry out planning and organization work according to their own characteristics and establish a normal production order. Therefore, the mechanical industry sector must further strengthen planning work, use planning to determine the tasks, progress, and interrelationships of various links in the enterprise, and through the implementation, inspection, and dispatch of the plan, organize the work of each factory in a balanced and comprehensive manner.

During the Five-Year Plan, the mechanical industry sector will build a number of new factories. These factories are equipped with the latest technology, and after they are completed, they will greatly change the face of China's mechanical industry. This is the most important aspect of overcoming the backward state of technology in China's mechanical industry. After the new factories are completed, the key issue is mastering new technologies. Only by mastering new technologies can we manufacture qualified products, give full play to the factory's production capacity, and meet the factory's design requirements. To master new technologies, we must first do a good job of preparing for all aspects before starting work. For factories designed abroad, after various technical materials arrive, they must be quickly organized for translation and conscientious study, and then, based on these materials, complete specific preparations in all aspects before starting work. Secondly, trial production should be carried out to test whether the equipment, tools, and materials meet the requirements, proofread various technical documents, and educate employees to be familiar with and master new equipment, new tools, and new operating methods. In trial production, from parts to finished products, they are required to be made according to the rules (to meet quality standards), and then required to be made quickly (to meet technical quotas), until all processes are mastered, then it is considered that the new production has been completely mastered.

Serious waste in production and capital construction must be resolutely overcome. In terms of production, due to poor planning and organization, the enterprises under the First Ministry of Machine Building suffered a loss of more than 9 million yuan due to idle work in 1954. Some factories, because they could not master the technology and the quality of their products was unstable, resulted in a large amount of rework and scrap. In 1954, the average scrap rate of castings was as high as 12.5 percent. Together with the scrap in processing, the total loss for the year was more than 20 million yuan. In terms of capital construction, due to poor planning, design rework, stockpiling of materials, idle labor, more capital occupation and less completion of workload often occur, which also causes huge waste. These not only waste state funds, but also hinder the improvement of enterprise management level and affect the construction costs of other departments.

We must recognize that economy is one of the most important principles of managing socialist enterprises. Implementing strict economy plays an important role in expanding capital accumulation and accelerating the country's socialist industrialization. Although enterprises under the First Mechanical Department have made considerable achievements in material saving in the past two years, the phenomenon of waste in the use of materials is still very serious; especially the utilization rate of metal is very low, and a large amount of metal materials are cut into waste; many enterprises lack dedicated personnel to manage the recycling of waste products and scrap, the material management system is not sound, large materials are used for small purposes, good materials are used for bad purposes, and the phenomenon of material corrosion and deterioration due to poor material storage and maintenance also occurs continuously. These phenomena must be resolutely overcome.

In order to strive to promote the work of economy to production, the employees of the mechanical industry sector must assist the administrative leadership, strive to improve the quality of planning, rationally reserve materials; rationally use materials; improve the metal utilization coefficient; implement the system of quota material distribution, and strengthen the recycling and collection of waste metal. In order to carry out these tasks, the employees of the mechanical industry sector must further strengthen the work of the trade union, mobilize the masses, put forward rationalization proposals, carry out various forms of labor competition, vigorously promote advanced experience, and combine it with all aspects of the work in the enterprise, especially to combine it with strengthening political and ideological work, and with the struggle to eliminate hidden counter-revolutionaries, so as to ensure the completion of our tasks.

In order to better undertake these tasks, it is undoubtedly necessary to strengthen the ideological and organizational construction of the trade union organization, effectively improve the leadership style, closely contact the masses, so as to give full play to the role of the trade union organization; at the same time, it is necessary to educate the masses to raise their revolutionary vigilance, and in all enterprises in the mechanical industry sector, without exception, resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate all counter-revolutionaries. The resolution passed by the congress on "resolutely eliminating all counter-revolutionaries" is very necessary.

The First National Congress of the Mechanical and Engineering Workers' Union of China has ended, and the question now is how to implement the spirit of this congress and the guidelines and principles it has determined into practical work.

　　机械工业部门职工的任务
    中国第一机械工会第一次全国代表大会总结了一九五零年到现在的中国第一机械工会的工作，讨论和确定了中国第一机械工会在第一个五年计划期间的工作方针和任务，并选出了中国第一机械工会的全国领导机关，现在宣告闭幕了。
    这次大会确定，中国第一机械工会必须密切配合行政的工作，加强和工人群众的联系，提高工人群众的觉悟程度和组织程度，组织工人群众掌握新技术，广泛和深入地开展劳动竞赛，努力增产，厉行节约，以保证完成和力求超额完成第一个五年计划；并在发展生产的基础上，逐步地改善工人群众的物质生活和文化生活，为逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造事业而奋斗。大会根据机械工业的情况和特点，确定了劳动竞赛的总目标，要求运用多种多样的竞赛形式，吸引更多的工人、技术人员和职员参加竞赛；并强调要掌握新技术，保证新产品的试制工作，完成品种计划，保证产品的质量，减少废品和节约金属。大会还强调指出，必须加强资本主义的机械企业中的工会工作，为私营机械工业的社会主义改造建立基础。这次大会是有重要收获的。
    我国第一个五年计划的基本任务，是为完全实现我国过渡时期的总任务打下初步基础。为了这个目的，我们必须集中力量优先发展重工业。作为重工业的核心和向国民经济各个部门提供技术装备的机械工业，在完成五年计划的斗争中担负着重要的任务。我国机械工业几年来在党和政府的正确领导下，由于苏联的援助和全体职工的努力，虽然有了不少进步，但是由于国家建设的发展，目前机械工业的水平还落后于国家的要求。
    正如中国共产党中央委员会的祝词中所说的：
  “发展重工业和它的核心——机械工业是国家的社会主义工业化的基础。几年来，我国机械工业有了很大的进步，试制成功了许多过去不能制造的新产品，但是，也应指出，我们的机械工业还存在着很多问题——产品质量不佳，新产品试制工作还不能令人满意，浪费现象严重，许多新的技术设备还不能很好地掌握等等。全国机械工业的工人、工程技术人员和职员同志们必须作进一步的努力来逐步改变这种状态，以适应国家经济建设的需要。”中国共产党中央委员会号召“大会进一步密切工会与群众的联系，进一步提高职工群众的政治觉悟，发扬工人阶级艰苦奋斗的优良传统，厉行全面节约，加强劳动纪律，努力学习苏联先进经验，掌握新的技术，推广我国行之有效的先进经验，开展群众性的合理化建议，发挥机械工业部门全体职工的积极性和创造性，把劳动竞赛推向新的高涨，不断地提高劳动生产率，为胜利完成你们所担负的第一个五年计划的光荣任务而奋斗。”
    为了完成这个重大的任务，目前机械工业部门的全体职工必须努力克服机械工业现存的缺点。目前机械工业的主要缺点是：工作的计划和组织不好，技术落后，浪费很大。这三个缺点能否克服，将是机械工业部门能否完成五年计划的关键。
  　机械工业在一九五三年曾经以作业计划为中心，加强计划管理工作，一九五四年又进行了生产技术准备计划化的工作。这些工作收到了一定的成效。但各个企业管理工作的改进是极不平衡的。目前除少数企业管理得比较好以外，多数企业还不能按照自己的特点来进行计划和组织工作，把正常的生产秩序建立起来。因此，机械工业部门还必须进一步加强计划工作，通过计划把企业的各个环节的任务、进度和相互关系加以确定，并经过计划的执行、检查和调度，把各个工厂的工作均衡地全面地组织起来。
    在五年计划中，机械工业部门将建设一批新的工厂。这些工厂都是用最新技术装备起来的，它们建成以后，将大大改变我国机械工业的面貌。这是克服我国机械工业技术落后状态的最重要的一个方面。新工厂建成以后，关键问题是掌握新技术问题，掌握了新技术才能制造出合格的产品，发挥工厂的生产能力，达到工厂设计的要求。要掌握新技术，首先在开工前要做好各项准备工作。国外设计的工厂，当各种技术资料到达以后，就必须迅速组织翻译，认真学习，然后以这些资料为根据，在开工前完成各方面的具体准备工作。其次要进行试生产，考验设备、工具、材料等是否符合要求，校对各种技术文件，并教育职工熟悉和掌握新设备、新工具和新操作方法。在试生产中从零件到成品都要求按规矩做成（达到质量标准），然后要求做快（达到技术定额），直到所有过程都掌握好了，才算完全掌握了新的生产。
    在生产中和基本建设中的严重的浪费现象必须坚决克服。在生产方面，由于计划和组织不好，一九五四年第一机械工业部所属企业窝工损失达九百多万元。有些厂因为技术上掌握不住，产品质量不稳定，造成大量的返修和报废，一九五四年铸件废品率平均高达百分之十二点五，连同加工中的废品，全年共损失两千多万元。在基本建设方面，由于计划不周，经常发生设计返工、物资积压、人员窝工、资金占用的多而工作量完成的少等等现象，也造成了巨大浪费。这些不但浪费国家资金，而且妨碍企业管理水平的提高，影响其他部门的建设成本。
    我们必须认识，节约是管理社会主义企业的最重要的原则之一。实行严格的节约，对扩大资金积累，加速国家的社会主义工业化起重大作用。尽管近两年来，第一机械部门所属企业在物资节约方面曾取得了不少成绩；但目前物资使用上的浪费现象仍极严重；特别是金属利用率很低，大量金属材料被切削成废料；不少企业废品废料回收管理工作缺乏专人管理，材料管理制度不健全，大材小用，优材劣用，物资保管和保养不良，材料腐蚀变质现象也不断发生。这些现象必须坚决加以克服。
    为了争取把节约工作推广到生产中去，机械工业部门的职工们必须协助行政领导，努力提高计划质量，合理储备物资；合理地使用物资；提高金属利用系数；实行限额发料的制度，并加强废金属回收及收集工作。而要进行这些工作，就要依靠机械工业部门全体职工进一步加强工会工作，发动群众，提出合理化建议，开展各种形式的劳动竞赛，大力推广先进经验，并且同企业中各方面的工作相结合，特别是要同加强政治思想工作相结合，同肃清暗藏的反革命分子的斗争相结合，才能保证我们任务的完成。
    为了更好地担负起这些任务，无疑地还必须加强工会组织的思想建设和组织建设，切实地改进领导作风，密切联系群众，以充分发挥工会组织的作用；同时要教育群众提高革命警惕性，在机械工业部门的各个企业中，无例外地坚决、彻底、干净、全部地肃清一切反革命分子。大会特别通过了“关于坚决肃清一切反革命分子的决议”是很必要的。
    中国第一机械工会第一次全国代表大会结束了，现在的问题是如何把这次大会的精神和它所确定的方针和原则贯彻到实际工作中去。
