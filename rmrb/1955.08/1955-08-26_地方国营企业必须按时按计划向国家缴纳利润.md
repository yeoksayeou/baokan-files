　　Local State-Owned Enterprises Must Remit Profits to the State on Time and According to Plan
　　Gu Lianxi, Chief of Enterprise Finance Division, Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance
    In order to carry out the great socialist construction, and to victoriously realize our country's First Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to mobilize a large amount of construction funds through the state budget. At present, the main source of construction funds in our country is the internal accumulation of the socialist economy. Judging from Shanghai's local budget, the income of local state-owned enterprises in 1955 will account for 36.43 percent of the total local budget income, second only to various tax revenues. Therefore, how local state-owned enterprises remit profits on time and according to plan is an important issue to ensure the realization of the state budget.
    The state's construction is carried out according to plan, so it is necessary to supply the required funds in all aspects on time and according to plan. This requires that all budget revenues, especially the income of state-owned enterprises, be remitted on time and according to plan. Remitting profits on time and according to plan can also promote enterprises to strive to complete production and sales plans, cost plans, and profit plans, improve the use of funds, and strengthen the enterprise's economic accounting system. Therefore, completing budget payments on time and according to plan is a basic principle of socialist enterprise management.
    Since 1954, local state-owned enterprises in Shanghai have generally been able to make payments on a monthly basis according to plan. According to the 1954 execution results, the vast majority of enterprises over-fulfilled the profit plan and payment plan. The total actual income of enterprises completed 122.4 percent of the budgeted figure, and at the same time, reversed the past phenomenon of loose payments in the first half of the year and tight payments in the second half of the year, ensuring the evenness of budget revenue.
    However, local state-owned enterprises in Shanghai still have serious shortcomings in the implementation of the budget payment plan. Many enterprise units cannot complete the payment plan because they cannot complete the profit plan. In 1954, thirty-two units did not complete the profit remittance plan, most of which were caused by poor management and failure to complete production, sales or cost plans. For example, the underwear knitting factory and the motor hosiery factory under the Textile Industry Bureau have long been affected by low product quality and high costs, which affect the completion of profit and profit remittance plans. Some units have used funds improperly, resulting in a large backlog of raw materials and finished products, which occupied the profits that should be remitted. For example, China Metallurgical Plant, China Centrifuge Casting Plant, and Lumber Factory No. 1 owed 380,000 yuan in profits in 1954, which have not yet been paid. In the first quarter of this year, all local state-owned enterprises completed 100.86 percent of the profit plan, but the payment amount only reached 95 percent of the planned amount. Many enterprise accounting statements cannot be submitted within the prescribed time, which affects the financial authorities' settlement of enterprises' above-plan profits and the implementation of financial supervision.
    The reason for this situation is that the leaders of many enterprises only pay attention to completing the production plan, ignore the completion of the profit plan, ignore the rational use of funds, and ignore the obligation to make payments. They believe that these are just the work of financial personnel, and that it is secondary whether the profit plan and payment plan are completed after the production plan is completed. The financial personnel simply play the role of bookkeeping, without urging the enterprise to fully complete the plan through the implementation of the financial plan, and without taking the supervision of the enterprise to earnestly implement the payment plan as the responsibility of the financial personnel. The competent departments of enterprises are also not concerned enough about the payment situation of their subordinate enterprises and have not strictly supervised them. When individual enterprises have difficulties in completing budget payments, the competent departments do not take active measures to help them overcome the difficulties, but instead hold a laissez-faire attitude; some competent departments even believe that their subordinate local state-owned enterprises are fewer and smaller in scale than joint state-private enterprises, so they do not pay attention to them. The financial authorities also lack strict inspection and supervision of the payment situation of enterprises, and have not conducted serious struggles against violations of financial discipline that illegally occupy payable profits, and the payment system is not sound enough.
    In order to ensure that local state-owned enterprises in Shanghai can complete and over-fulfill the budget payment plan on time, enterprise leaders and financial personnel should first clearly recognize that remitting profits on time and according to plan is an important guarantee for the realization of the state budget, and is the duty that socialist enterprises should fulfill to the state and the financial discipline that must be observed, so as to earnestly implement the budget payment plan. Secondly, all enterprises should actively increase production, try out new products, improve product quality, save raw materials, reduce raw material consumption quotas, reduce management expenses, workshop expenses, and non-productive expenditures, and reduce product costs under the principle of supply, production, and sales balance, to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of the profit plan. At the same time, it is necessary to prevent blind procurement, rationally reduce raw material reserve quotas; prevent blind production and avoid product backlog; actively dispose of stagnant materials; settle accounts in a timely manner and accelerate capital turnover; and promote monthly plans to ensure the planning of capital utilization. The competent business departments should strengthen the leadership of local state-owned enterprises, gradually improve the management level of these enterprises, urge them to complete and over-fulfill production, cost, and financial plans, submit accounting statements in a timely manner, complete budget payments on time and according to plan, and settle above-plan profits in a timely manner. The competent departments also have the right to make adjustments among the subordinate enterprises to ensure the completion of the payment plan of the entire department. The financial authorities should also strengthen the inspection and supervision of enterprises through the competent business departments, and conduct serious struggles against violations of financial discipline that cannot make payments on time and according to plan or arbitrarily occupy budgetary funds that should be paid, so that the wealth created and the funds accumulated by socialist enterprises can quickly serve the country's construction.

### 地方国营企业必须按时按计划向国家缴纳利润

　　地方国营企业必须按时按计划向国家缴纳利润
　　上海市财政局企业财务处处长　顾濂溪
    为了进行伟大的社会主义建设，为了胜利地实现我国第一个五年计划，就必须通过国家预算来动员大量建设资金。目前我国建设资金的主要来源，是社会主义经济的内部积累。从上海市地方预算来看，一九五五年地方国营企业的收入要占地方预算收入总数的百分之三六点四三，仅略次于各项税收数。因此，地方国营企业如何按时按计划缴纳利润，是保证实现国家预算的一个重要问题。
    国家的建设是按计划进行的，因此必须按时按计划供应各方面所需要的资金。这就要求各项预算收入，首先是国营企业收入能按时按计划缴纳。按时按计划缴纳利润，还能促使企业努力完成产销计划、成本计划和利润计划，改善资金运用情况，加强企业的经济核算制度。因此，按时按计划完成预算缴款，是社会主义企业管理的基本原则。
    一九五四年以来，上海市地方国营企业一般都能按月按计划数缴款。一九五四年执行结果，绝大多数企业超额完成了利润计划和缴款计划，企业实际收入总数完成了预算数的百分之一二二点四，同时扭转了过去缴款上半年松下半年紧的现象，保证了预算收入的均匀。
    但上海市地方国营企业执行预算缴款计划时，还有很严重的缺点。不少企业单位因完不成利润计划，也就不能完成缴款计划。一九五四年没有完成利润上缴计划的有三十二个单位，其中多数是由于经营管理不善，没有完成生产、销售或成本计划所造成的。如纺织工业局所属内衣针织厂、电机织袜厂，长期以来因为产品质量低劣，成本高，影响利润和利润上缴计划的完成。有些单位因为资金运用不善，原材料和成品大量积压，占用了应上缴的利润。如中华冶金厂、中国离心机铸厂、木材一厂等三个单位就拖欠了一九五四年利润三十八万元，到今还未缴纳。全部地方国营企业今年第一季完成利润计划百分之一○○点八六，但缴款数只达计划数百分之九五。很多企业会计决算报告不能按规定时间报送，以致影响了财政机关对企业超计划利润的结算和财政监督的进行。
    造成这种情况的原因，主要是不少企业的领导人员只注意完成生产计划，忽视完成利润计划，忽视合理地运用资金，忽视履行缴款的义务。他们认为这些不过是财务人员的工作，认为生产计划完成了，利润计划和缴款计划完成与否是次要的事情。而财务人员则单纯起了记帐的作用，没有通过财务计划的执行，督促企业全面地完成计划，没有把督促企业认真执行缴款计划作为财务人员的职责。企业主管部门对所属企业的缴款情况也不够关心和没有严加督促，个别企业完成预算缴款有困难时，主管部门不采取积极措施来帮助他们克服困难，而是抱着放任自流的态度；有些企业主管部门甚至认为所属地方国营企业比公私合营企业单位少、规模小，因而不加重视。财政机关对企业缴款情况也缺乏严格的检查和监督，对非法占用应缴利润的违反财政纪律现象没有进行严肃的斗争，缴款制度也不够健全。
    为了保证上海市地方国营企业能按时完成和超额完成预算缴款计划，企业领导人员和财务人员首先应该明确认识按时按计划上缴利润是实现国家预算的重要保证，是社会主义企业对国家应尽的义务和必须遵守的财政纪律，从而认真地执行预算缴款计划。其次，各企业应该在供、产、销平衡的原则下，积极增加生产，试制新产品，提高产品质量，节约原材料，降低原材料消耗定额，降低管理费用、车间经费及非生产性支出，降低产品成本，保证完成和超额完成利润计划。同时，要防止盲目采购，合理降低原材料储备定额；防止盲目生产，避免产品积压；积极处理呆滞物资；及时结算，加速资金周转；推行月度计划，保证资金运用计划化。业务主管部门应该加强对地方国营企业的领导，逐步提高这些企业的经营管理水平，督促他们完成和超额完成生产、成本和财务计划，及时报送会计决算报告，按时按计划完成预算缴款，及时结算超计划利润。主管部门并有权在所属企业间进行调剂，以保证整个部门缴款计划的完成。财政机关也应通过业务主管部门，加强对企业的检查和督促，对不能按时按计划缴款或任意占用应缴预算款项的违反财政纪律现象，进行严肃的斗争，使社会主义企业所创造的财富和积累的资金能迅速地为国家建设服务。　（原载解放日报，本报略加删改）
