　　Large-Scale Blasting Conducted at Guanyinshan Station Construction Site

　　On August 10th, at the Guanyinshan Station construction site on the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, a large-scale blasting, unprecedented in scale, was carried out using advanced Soviet experience. This blasting removed four hilltops, totaling 200,000 cubic meters of rock and earth, ensuring the completion of Guanyinshan Station six months ahead of schedule and saving the state 100,000 yuan.

　　At 10:00 a.m. that day, as people watched attentively in the safety zone with excitement, a deafening roar was heard. A large quantity of explosives buried within the four hilltops detonated simultaneously. Instantly, a massive fire and thick smoke blotted out the sky and the sun. The four towering hilltops were leveled in an instant, providing an excellent foundation for building the station.

　　The terrain at the Guanyinshan Station construction site was narrow, with steep cliffs. If manual excavation were used, the terrain limitations would prevent the concentration of a large number of workers, and multi-layered operations would be required. This would not only prolong the construction period but also endanger the safety of the workers. The use of large-scale blasting completely overcame these shortcomings.

　　This large-scale blasting was carried out under the guidance of Soviet expert Comrade Chichikin. Through this blasting, a group of Chinese workers, engineers, and technicians accumulated some experience. In future construction projects of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, large-scale blasting will continue to be used in order to ensure early completion and reduce construction costs. (Li Ximing, et al.)

　　观音山车站工地进行大爆破
    八月十日，宝成铁路北段观音山车站工地，采用苏联先进经验，进行了一次规模空前的大爆破。这次爆破炸掉了四个山头、二十万立方的山石，保证观音山车站能提前六个月完工，为国家节约资金十万元。
    当天上午十时，当人们在安全区怀着兴奋的心情凝神观望的时候，只听轰的一声巨响，埋藏在四个山头内的大量炸药一起爆炸。顿时，巨火浓烟遮蔽天日，四个耸立的山头一下削平了，成了建立车站的很好的基地。
    观音山车站工地地势狭窄，山崖陡峭。如果用人工开挖，因受地形限制，不能集中大量工人，同时需要进行多层作业，这样不但使工期拖长，而且使工人的安全受到威胁。采用大爆破法，完全克服了这些缺点。
    这一次大爆破是在苏联专家契契金同志指导下进行的。经过这次爆破，我国一批工人、工程师和技术人员积累了一些经验。今后在宝成铁路修建工程中，大爆破法还将继续采用，以便保证提前通车和降低工程成本。　（李锡明等）
