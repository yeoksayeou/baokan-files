Comrade Park Chung-hee, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party:

    Our Korean people, with extremely joyful and inspiring feelings, welcome the tenth anniversary of the national holiday – "August 15th" – when we were liberated from the colonial rule of Japanese imperialism thanks to the great Soviet army.
    On this day, when our people celebrate the greatest and most glorious event in their lives, they extend their national gratitude and honor to their great liberator and true helper – the fraternal Soviet people.
    In the course of history, ten years is not a long time. However, in these ten years, historically significant changes have taken place in our country.
    For ten years, our Korean people have achieved brilliant victories in the struggle for the unification, independence, and democratic development of the motherland, and in consolidating our revolutionary base – the democratic base.
    Never in the thousands of years of our history have there been such great changes as in the recent decade. This change was made possible because the great Soviet army opened the path to national rejuvenation for us on August 15th ten years ago.
    August 15th – this is indeed an unforgettable day that opened a new era in Korean history. While celebrating liberation, the Korean people began to embark on the path of creating a new life and a new history.
    However, Korea, liberated from Japanese imperialist colonial rule, was divided into North and South. Due to the implementation of a colonial policy by the American army in the southern half, various difficulties and obstacles were laid in the path of our country's development.
    Under this situation, our party adopted the policy of laying a strong material foundation in the northern half, where the Soviet army was stationed, for the unification of the motherland.
    The correctness of this policy, which has been absolutely supported and approved by the Korean people, has been further proved in practice.
    In the northern half of our country, under the leadership of our party and Comrade Kim Il-sung, a people's government was established, and a democratic national united front uniting the broad patriotic democratic forces based on the worker-peasant alliance was formed.
    The patriotic democratic forces united around the people's government have become an invincible force. The unity of patriotic democratic forces that place national interests above personal interests, and the establishment of a people's government representing all strata of the people, have expanded and strengthened the revolutionary forces and strengthened the unity of the Korean people.
    In a short period of time, the people's government has steadfastly and effectively completed various democratic reforms that our people have long expected. The realization of land reform has forever liberated our peasants from slavery, poverty, and backwardness, promoted the rapid development of the rural economy, and transformed the peasants, who constitute the vast majority of our country's population, into the most reliable allies of the working class.
    We nationalized all factories, enterprises, banks, transportation, and postal and telecommunications organs owned by Japanese imperialism and comprador capitalists, smashing the double shackles that bound the Korean working class.
    The realization of land reform and the nationalization of industry have basically eliminated the exploitation of man by man and guaranteed the rapid development of productive forces. The promulgation of the Labor Law and the Law on Equal Rights for Men and Women, the establishment of a democratic education system, and the establishment of the people's armed forces have put us on the road to creating a new life. As a result, profound and fundamental changes have taken place in the social, political, and economic life of the northern half of the republic. The northern half of the republic has transformed from a colonial and semi-feudal old society into a new society of people's democracy.
    Under the people's democratic system established in the northern half of the republic, the political ideology of patriotism and proletarian internationalism has been formed and strengthened. The northern half of the republic has become a rock-solid revolutionary democratic base for defending the unification and independent autonomy of the motherland. Its rapid development has proved that the people's democratic system has endless vitality.
    However, because the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique launched an aggression against the northern half of the republic, the Korean people had to temporarily suspend peaceful construction.
    The Korean people defended the freedom and independence of the motherland against the armed aggression of the enemy. The three-year Fatherland Liberation War was a serious test for our people, a test of the endless vitality of our people's democratic system, and a test of the unity and solidarity of the people of all strata based on the worker-peasant alliance. The Korean people, who were masters of their own affairs and in control of their own destiny, united as one under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government to participate in the struggle against the aggression of the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique, overcame all difficulties and hardships, and displayed a high degree of patriotism and heroism in the front and the rear, achieving a glorious victory.
    The just struggle of the Korean people was strongly supported and aided by hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world, headed by the great Soviet people and the Chinese people. This noble support became our great source of encouragement and our guarantee of victory.
    The power of great internationalist aid was more fully manifested in the Korean people's struggle against the US aggressors. The call of good people demanding to stop the US aggression resounded throughout the corners of the world.
    When our struggle was at its most difficult time, the great six hundred million Chinese brothers under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, holding high the banner of "Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea," sent a volunteer army composed of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people to the fighting Korean territory. The entry of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army into Korea favorably changed the Korean war situation. The Korean and Chinese peoples, shoulder to shoulder, bravely carried out a bloody struggle against the common enemy – the US aggressors. In the sacred anti-aggression war, the fighting friendship and solidarity between the Korean and Chinese peoples was further consolidated.
    The entry of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army into Korea became a vivid example of the spirit of internationalism, further strengthening our people's will to fight and confidence in victory.
    The great achievements of the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army and the noble spirit of internationalism of the Chinese brothers, which are left in every town and village, every hill and plain, every tree and every stone in Korea, will last together with the heroic Korean people and will forever radiate light in our history.
    The victory achieved by the Korean people in the three-year fierce war not only gloriously defended the freedom and independence of the motherland, but also made a great contribution to the great cause of peace in the Far East and the world.
    The victory of the Korean people is the victory of our people's democratic system based on the worker-peasant alliance, and the victory of the international peace and democracy camp over the forces of war.
    The victorious armistice provided the Korean people with the possibility of carrying out peaceful construction.
    A arduous and urgent task is placed before the Korean people – to turn the armistice into a consolidated peace, and to further strengthen the democratic base of the northern half of the republic politically, economically, and militarily in order to achieve the great cause of the peaceful reunification of the motherland. Our Korean people are unanimously rising up to carry out a solemn struggle to realize this task.
    To rapidly restore and develop the various sectors of the people's economy that were severely damaged by the US armed aggressors in the three-year Fatherland Liberation War is an arduous undertaking that requires huge amounts of capital, equipment, technology, and labor. However, we are effectively carrying out economic construction by utilizing the endless creative power and potential of the people and relying on the huge economic and technical assistance of the countries of the peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp, headed by the great Soviet Union and China.
    The party's task during the period of post-war economic construction, as Comrade Kim Il-sung put it at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Party in 1953, lies in first developing heavy industry, while correspondingly developing light industry and agriculture.
    The direction of post-war restoration and development of the people's economy put forward by Comrade Kim Il-sung is in line with the requirements of our revolutionary development and the interests and aspirations of the Korean people. Therefore, it has been unanimously supported by the entire people, enabling the working masses to give full play to their creative power.
    The implementation of the post-war three-year plan for the restoration and development of the people's economy, which began in 1954, clearly shows the endless creative enthusiasm and great achievements of our people.
    In the two years since the armistice, thanks to the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the huge economic and technical assistance of the people of various brotherly countries headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, the Korean people have overfulfilled many parts of the 1954 plan, and today they are launching a fierce campaign to fulfill and overfulfill the three-year plan ahead of schedule.
    In the industrial sector, in the past two years, 230 factories, mines, coal mines, and shipyards headed by the Supung Hydroelectric Power Plant, the Hwanghae Iron Works, the Kim Chaek Iron Works, and the Hungnam Fertilizer Factory, which were severely damaged during the war, have been completely or partially restored, and these enterprises have now been put into production. In addition, more than 60 large and medium-sized industrial enterprises equipped with advanced technology have been newly built, such as the Heechon Machine Manufacturing Factory, the Pyongyang Textile Joint Factory, the Guseong Textile Factory, and the Pyongyang Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Plant.
    In this way, industrial production has seen significant growth and has made brilliant achievements. In 1954, the production level of state-owned and cooperative industries exceeded the pre-war 1949 production level by 3 percent, and in the first half of 1955, the average monthly production level exceeded the average monthly production level in 1949 by 43 percent.
    With the steady development of heavy industry, the light industry sector has also achieved remarkable results in the task of producing daily necessities. Comparing the first half of 1955 with the first half of 1953, the production of cotton fabrics has increased to twice as much, and the production of silk fabrics has increased to four times as much.
    In the two years since the armistice, the agricultural sector has also made remarkable achievements.
    In order to expand the cultivated area, the agricultural sector has extensively carried out the work of reclaiming wasteland and protecting existing land, as well as the struggle to expand the irrigated area. It has restored and expanded tens of thousands of machobo (one machobo is approximately equal to 15 mu) of farmland, and has built many reservoirs, embankments, and canals.
    In the two years since the armistice, the agricultural economy of the state and agricultural production cooperative sectors has developed rapidly.
    Agricultural production cooperatives have absorbed 44 percent of all farm households and 42 percent of the total farmland area. At the same time, in order to improve technology and reduce farmers' labor, agricultural machinery service stations and cattle and horse service stations have been widely established in the rural economy sector.
    Although the development of the rural economy has made many achievements, we cannot be satisfied with the status quo. Therefore, the November 1954 Plenary Session of the Central Committee of our Party adopted various measures to expand the cultivated area, increase the total grain output, and improve animal husbandry, and at the same time adopted a series of measures to consolidate and develop existing agricultural production cooperatives. Today, our party pays great attention to the rapid development of the rural economy and is actively carrying out the struggle for this purpose.
    During this period, new achievements have also been made in the cultural and health sectors.
    Our country now has 3,604 primary schools, 1,250 junior and senior secondary schools, 72 technical schools and vocational schools, and 16 higher education institutions, with more than 1.83 million students studying in these schools. In the post-war period, 276 hospitals with 15,700 beds and 134 clinics with 248 consulting rooms have also been opened.
    Not only that, thanks to the noble assistance of the people of brotherly countries, our country is magnificently restoring various cities, headed by the capital Pyongyang, and is restoring and building many new houses and cultural facilities.
    With the rapid restoration and development of the people's economy, the people's living standards have also been rapidly improved. Thanks to the care of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government, the prices of hundreds of commodities have been reduced four times in the post-war period. In addition, the monetary wages of workers and staff have also increased. Therefore, their actual wages have more than doubled in the two years since the war.
    All these achievements that our people have made in the past ten years clearly prove the superiority of our people's democratic system and the correctness of the policies of the Korean Workers' Party.
    Strengthening internationalist ties with the people of various brotherly countries headed by the great Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is a valuable guarantee of our victory. This unbreakable friendship will, as in the past, be a solid guarantee of our people's victory.
    The arduous and glorious task facing our party and people is to unify the motherland, which has been divided for ten years, to strengthen the democratic base, and to rapidly develop the post-war people's economy. Our people are effectively carrying out the work of consolidating the socialist foundation in the northern half of the republic. This is a material guarantee for ensuring the peaceful reunification of the motherland, strengthening the democratic base, and rapidly improving the people's living standards.
    However, the task before us is by no means easy. We are deeply aware of the arduousness of this task. The realization of this task requires our persevering and unremitting struggle.
    Because the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique, entrenched in South Korea, not only do not accept the wishes of the Korean people in North and South Korea to contact each other and peacefully reunify the motherland, but are also carrying out dangerous tricks in an attempt to undermine the armistice agreement.
    Our task is to smash the enemy's conspiracy, realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and solidly build the road to building a new life.
    The current situation indicates that it is not the "policy of strength" that is gaining victory, but the desire for peace and consultation. For example, the restoration of normal relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia on the initiative of the Soviet Union, the solution of the Austrian question, the achievements of the Asian-African Conference, the strengthening of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and India, China and India, China and Myanmar, and China and Indonesia, as well as the positive response to the Soviet proposal to establish diplomatic relations with West Germany and the positive achievements of the Four-Power Summit, all illustrate this fact.
    The United States and the Syngman Rhee clique fail to see this trend in the current international situation, disregard the will of our people in demanding North and South Korea to contact each other and peacefully reunify the motherland, and attempt to obstruct its realization, and obstruct the noble cause of guiding the Korean armistice toward further consolidation of peace. If their conspiracy continues, they will be met with greater opposition from peace-loving people, and they will suffer a faster fate of defeat.
    Today, the Korean people are not relaxing in the slightest. They are watching with a hundredfold vigilance the conspiracy to undermine peace and consultation, watching their every move, consolidating the victories they have already achieved, and marching forward with full confidence in victory in their just cause.
    Just as the Korean people have stood firmly in the international democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union and China for the past ten years and have achieved great victories, they will continue to hold high the banner of proletarian internationalism and vigorously carry out the struggle to win the peaceful reunification of the motherland and lay the socialist foundation.
    The wishes of the Korean people will surely be realized.

    朝鲜人民解放十年来的成就
    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长  朴正爱
    我们朝鲜人民以极其欢欣鼓舞的心情，迎接依靠伟大的苏联军队从日本帝国主义殖民统治下获得解放的民族节日——“八·一五”十周年。
    我国人民在庆祝自己的生活中成为最大而光辉的事件的这一天的时候，向自己伟大的解放者和真正的援助者——兄弟般的苏联人民，致以全民的感谢和荣誉。
    在历史发展过程中，十年的时间并不算太长。但是在这十年中，我国却发生了具有历史意义的变化。
    十年来，我们朝鲜人民在争取祖国的统一、独立和民主的发展，巩固我们革命的策源地——民主基地的斗争中，取得了辉煌的胜利。
    在我国历史上几千年来从未有过像最近十年间这样伟大的变化，这种变化之成为可能，是由于十年前的八月十五日，伟大的苏联军队为我们开辟了民族复兴的道路。
    八月十五日——这的确是在朝鲜历史上开辟了新纪元的永远难忘的日子。朝鲜人民在欢庆解放的同时，开始踏上了创造新生活和新历史的道路。
    但是从日本帝国主义殖民统治下获得解放的朝鲜被分割为南北两部，由于美国军队在南半部实行了殖民政策，因而在我国的发展前途上布下了种种困难和障碍。
    在这种形势下，我们党采取了在苏联军队驻守的北半部奠定统一祖国的强有力的物质基础的方针。
    受到朝鲜人民的绝对支持和赞同的这一方针的正确性，在实际生活中更加得到了证明。
    在我国北半部，在我们党和金日成同志的领导下建立了人民政权，结成了以工农联盟为基础的、团结广大的爱国民主力量的民主主义民族统一战线。
    团结在人民政权周围的爱国民主力量，成为一支不可战胜的力量。把民族利益放在个人利益之上的爱国民主力量的团结和代表各阶层的人民政权的建立，扩大并加强了革命力量，也加强了朝鲜人民的统一。
    在短短的时期里，人民政权坚定不渝地、有效地完成了我国人民长期期望的各项民主改革。土地改革的实现，使我国农民从奴隶、贫穷和落后状态中永远获得了解放，促进了农村经济的迅速发展，并使占我国人口绝大多数的农民转变为工人阶级的最可靠同盟者。
    我们把日本帝国主义和买办资本家所有的工厂、企业、银行、运输、邮电机关等都收归国有，粉碎了束缚朝鲜工人阶级的双重枷锁。
    土地改革和产业国有化的实现，基本上肃清了人对人的剥削，保障了生产力的迅速发展。劳动法令和男女平等权法令的颁布、民主教育制度的树立、人民武装力量的建立等，使我们踏上了创造新生活的道路。结果，共和国北半部的社会、政治、经济生活都起了深刻的根本变化。共和国北半部从殖民地半封建的旧社会转变成为人民民主的新社会。
    在共和国北半部所建立的人民民主制度下，爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义的政治思想形成并加强起来了。共和国北半部成了捍卫祖国的统一和独立自主的磐石般巩固的革命民主基地。它的飞跃的发展证实了人民民主制度是具有无穷无尽的活力。
    但是由于美帝国主义和李承晚集团对共和国北半部发动了侵略，朝鲜人民不得不暂时停止和平建设。
    朝鲜人民在敌人的武装侵略下保卫了祖国的自由和独立。三年祖国解放战争是对我国人民的严重考验，是对我国人民民主制度无穷无尽的活力的检验，也是对以工农联盟为基础的各阶层人民的统一和团结力量的检验。当家做主并掌握着自己命运的朝鲜人民，在朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的领导下，万众一心地参加了反对美国和李承晚集团的侵犯的斗争，克服了一切艰难困苦，在前方和后方发挥了高度的爱国主义精神和英雄主义气概，取得了光荣的胜利。
    朝鲜人民的正义斗争，受到了以伟大的苏联人民和中国人民为首的世界亿万爱好和平人民的强大支持和声援。这一高贵的声援，成了我们巨大的鼓舞力量，也成了我们胜利的保证。
    在朝鲜人民反对美国侵略者的斗争中，更加充分地表现了伟大的国际主义援助的威力。善良人们要求制止美国侵略的呼声响彻了世界各个角落。
    当我们的斗争处于最困难的时期，在毛泽东同志和中国共产党领导下的伟大的六亿中国兄弟，高举起“抗美援朝”的旗帜，派遣了以中国人民的优秀子女组成的志愿军部队来到战斗的朝鲜疆土。中国人民志愿军的入朝作战，有利地转变了朝鲜战局。朝中人民并肩携手，英勇地进行了反对共同敌人——美国侵略者的浴血斗争。在神圣的反侵略战争中，朝中人民的战斗友谊和团结更加巩固起来了。
    中国人民志愿军的入朝作战，成了国际主义精神的活生生的榜样，进一步坚定了我们人民的斗争意志和胜利信心。
    在朝鲜的每个城镇和农村里、每个山岗和平原上、每一棵树和每一块石头上所留下的志愿军指挥员和战斗员的伟大功勋和中国兄弟的崇高的国际主义精神，将同英勇的朝鲜人民一起长存，在我国历史上将永远放射光芒。
    朝鲜人民在三年激烈的战争里所取得的胜利，不仅光荣地捍卫了祖国的自由和独立，而且对远东和世界和平的伟大事业作出了巨大的贡献。
    朝鲜人民的胜利，是以工农联盟为基础的我们人民民主制度的胜利，是国际和平民主阵营对战争势力的胜利。
    胜利的停战又给朝鲜人民提供了进行和平建设的可能性。
    摆在朝鲜人民面前的是一个艰巨而迫切的任务——把停战变为巩固的和平，为达成祖国的和平统一的伟大事业而从政治、经济、军事方面进一步加强共和国北半部民主基地。我们朝鲜人民一致奋起为实现这个任务进行着庄严的斗争。
    要迅速恢复并发展在三年的祖国解放战争中遭到美国武装侵略者严重破坏的各部门人民经济，是一桩需要巨大的资金、设备、技术和劳动的艰巨事业。但是我们利用无穷尽的人民创造力量和潜力，依靠以伟大苏联和中国为首的和平民主社会主义阵营各国的巨大的经济和技术援助，正在有效地进行着经济建设。
    党在战后经济建设时期的任务，正如金日成同志在一九五三年党中央委员会第六次全体会议上所提出的：在于首先发展重工业，同时相应地发展轻工业和农业。
    金日成同志所提出的关于战后人民经济恢复发展的方向，是符合我们革命发展的各项要求和朝鲜人民的利益和愿望的。因此，它受到全体人民的一致支持，使劳动群众发挥着创造力量。
    从一九五四年开始实施的战后人民经济恢复发展三年计划的执行过程，明确地显示了我国人民所发挥的无穷尽的创造热忱和巨大成就。
    停战后两年来，由于朝鲜劳动党的正确领导和以苏联、中华人民共和国为首的各兄弟国家人民的巨大的经济和技术援助，朝鲜人民曾超额完成了一九五四年计划的许多部分，今天为提前完成和超额完成三年计划正展开炽烈的增产斗争。
    在工业部门，两年来完全或部分地恢复了在战时惨遭破坏的以水丰发电厂、黄海制铁所、金策制铁所、兴南肥料工厂等为首的二百三十所工厂、矿山、煤矿、造船厂，这些企业现在已投入了生产。此外，还新建了以先进技术装备起来的熙川机器制造工厂、平壤纺织联合工厂、龟城纺织工厂、平壤农业机械制造所等六十多所大中工业企业。
    这样，工业生产有了显著的增长并取得了辉煌的成就。一九五四年国营和合作社工业的生产水平，已超过了战前一九四九年生产水平百分之三，一九五五年上半年每月的平均生产水平超过一九四九年每月的平均生产水平百分之四十三。
    随着重工业的稳步发展，轻工业部门在生产日用品的任务方面，也取得了显著的成果。以一九五五年上半年和一九五三年上半年比较，棉织品生产增加到两倍，丝织品生产增加到四倍。
    停战后两年来，农业部门也取得了显著的成就。
    农业部门为了扩大耕地面积，广泛开展了开垦荒地和保护现有土地的工作以及扩大灌溉面积的斗争，业已恢复并扩张了几万町步（一町步约合十五市亩）的农地，并修筑了许多贮水池、堤坝和水渠。
    停战后两年来，国家和农业生产合作社部门的农业经济有了迅速的发展。
    农业生产合作社吸收了全体农户的百分之四十四和全部农地面积的百分之四十二。与此同时，农村经济部门为了改进技术，为了减轻农民的劳动力，广泛建立了农业机械代耕站和牛马代耕站。
    农村经济的发展虽然有了不少的成就，但我们还不能满足于现状。因此，我党中央委员会一九五四年十一月全体会议采取了扩大耕地面积、增加谷物总产量和改善畜牧业的各项措施，同时采取了巩固并发展已有的农业生产合作社的一连串措施。今天我党对农村经济的迅速发展予以极大的注意，并为此展开积极的斗争。
    在这一时期，文化、保健部门也取得了新的成果。
    我国现在已开设有三千六百零四所小学、一千二百五十所初级和高级中等学校、七十二所技术学校和职业学校、十六所高等学院，有一百八十三万多名学生在这些学校里学习。在战后，也开设了有
  一万五千七百多个病床的二百七十六所医院和有二百四十八个诊室的一百三十四处诊疗所。
    不仅如此，由于兄弟各国人民的高贵援助，我国在战后正雄壮地恢复着以首都平壤市为首的各城市，恢复并新建许多住宅和文化设施。
    随着人民经济的迅速恢复和发展，人民生活也得到了迅速的提高。由于朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的关怀，战后已四次降低了数百种商品的价格。加之工人、职员的货币工资也有增加，因此，他们的实际工资在战后两年来已增为两倍以上。
    过去十年间我们人民所取得的这一切成就，明确地证实了我国的人民民主制度的优越性和朝鲜劳动党政策的正确性。
    同以伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国为首的各兄弟国家人民加强国际主义的联系，是我们胜利的可贵的保证。这种牢不可破的友谊，今后也像过去那样将成为我们人民胜利的巩固保证。
    摆在我党和人民面前的艰巨的、光荣的任务，就是把十年来分裂的祖国统一起来，并加强民主基地，迅速发展战后人民经济。我们人民正在有效地进行着在共和国北半部巩固地奠定社会主义基础的工作。这是保障祖国的和平统一、加强民主基地、迅速提高人民生活的物质保证。
    但是摆在我们面前的任务绝不是容易的。我们深知这一任务的艰巨性。这一任务的实现，需要我们坚忍的、不懈的斗争。
    因为盘踞在南朝鲜的美国和李承晚集团不仅不接受南北朝鲜接触和和平统一祖国的朝鲜人民的愿望，而且进行着企图破坏停战协定的危险的把戏。
    我们的任务就在于粉碎敌人的这种阴谋，实现祖国的和平统一，巩固地筑成建设新生活的道路。
    目前的一切局势指明，正在获得胜利的并不是“实力政策”，而是和平和协商的愿望。如在苏联的倡议下苏联和南斯拉夫恢复了正常关系，奥地利问题的解决，亚非国家会议的成就，苏联和印度、中国和印度、中国和缅甸、中国和印度尼西亚的友谊关系的加强以及对苏联建议同西德建立外交关系的肯定的反映和四国政府首脑会议的肯定的成就，都说明了这一事实。
    美国和李承晚集团看不到目前国际形势的这种趋向，无视我国人民要求南北朝鲜相互接触和和平统一祖国的意志，并企图阻挠它的实现，阻挠将朝鲜停战引向进一步巩固的和平的崇高事业；他们的这种阴谋如果继续下去，他们就会受到爱好和平人民的更大的反对，也就会使自己更快地遭到失败的命运。
    今天，朝鲜人民毫不松懈，他们正百倍警惕地注视着企图破坏和平和协商的阴谋，注视着他们的一举一动，巩固业已取得的胜利，对自己的正当事业满怀胜利信心地向前迈进。
    朝鲜人民像十年来坚强地站在以苏联、中国为首的国际民主阵营中并获得了伟大胜利一样，今后也将高举着无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，大力展开争取祖国的和平统一和奠定社会主义基础的斗争。
    朝鲜人民的愿望是一定会实现的。
