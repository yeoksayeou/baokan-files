The Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" No. 31, 1955, has been published.

This issue devotes considerable space to the report made by Bulganin on August 4th at the Third Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the results of the Geneva Four-Power Heads of Government Conference, and Zhou Enlai's speech at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress on the current international situation and the foreign policy of the People's Republic of China. This issue also reported the news announced by the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party regarding the death of Kyuichi Tokuda, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, and published a dispatch about the Fifth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship.

This issue contains an article by Luigi Longo, Deputy General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, "The Italian Communists Fight for Freedom, Peace, and a Leftward Turn of the Nation," which is an abstract of his report at the plenary session of the Italian Communist Party Central Committee on July 23rd this year. In his article, Longo pointed out that the two major events to which the Central Committee paid close attention were the fall of the Scelba government domestically and the Geneva Conference internationally. The fall of Scelba was not only the fall of a government, but also the bankruptcy of a system and a policy. Scelba's downfall is a boon to Italian democracy. However, we must still struggle to get the new government to adopt new policies. The Geneva Conference showed an intention to build international relations on a new basis, which in itself is a positive factor in easing international tensions and a symbol of the trend towards eliminating differences. In addition to these two important facts, there are still sharp political and social contradictions domestically. In general, the current situation is characterized by more intense political and social struggles, some developments in the domestic and international situation, and the possibility of achieving concrete achievements through political activities. The current task of us Communists is to take action, to influence the turbulent situation through our political activities, to influence those new factors, to make them more robust and stable, and not to allow the government and its friends to do whatever they want, especially to force the government and its friends to change their policies. Our struggle is based on the demand for a leftward turn. Only with this attitude and in this spirit can we further inspire the struggle for freedom in enterprises and the struggle for peace and the easing of international tensions. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    中文版一九五五年第三十一期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五五年第三十一期中文版已经出版。
    这一期以大量篇幅刊登了布尔加宁八月四日在苏联最高苏维埃第三次会议上所作的关于日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的结果的报告和周恩来在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上关于目前国际形势和中华人民共和国外交政策的发言。这一期还报道了日本共产党中央委员会所宣布的日本共产党中央委员会总书记德田球一逝世的消息，并且刊载了关于第五届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的通讯。
    这一期刊载了意大利共产党副总书记路·隆哥的文章“意大利共产党人为自由、和平和国家向左转而斗争”，这篇文章是他今年七月二十三日在意共中央全会上所作报告的摘要。隆哥在文章中指出，这次中央全会密切注意的两件重大的事情是国内方面谢尔巴政府的倒台和国际方面的日内瓦会议。谢尔巴的倒台不但是一个政府的倒台，而且也是一种制度和一种政策的破产。谢尔巴的倒台是意大利民主的幸事。但是，要想新政府采取新的政策，我们还必须进行斗争。日内瓦会议显示出一种想把国际关系建立在新的基础上的意向，单是这一点，就是缓和国际紧张局势的积极因素，是分歧趋向于消除的一种象征。除了这两件重要的事实以外，国内还存在着尖锐的政治和社会矛盾。总的说来，目前情况的特点是政治斗争和社会斗争已更加紧张，国内和国际形势有了某些发展，存在着通过政治活动而获得具体成就的可能性。我们共产党人当前的任务是行动起来，是通过我们的政治活动来影响动荡的局势，影响那些新的因素，使其更加茁壮，更加稳定，不容政府及其朋友们为所欲为，尤其是要迫使政府及其朋友们改变施政方针。我们的斗争是以要求向左转为基础的。我们只有用这种态度和以这种精神才能更加鼓舞争取在企业中的自由斗争，争取和平和缓和国际紧张局势的斗争。（新华社）
