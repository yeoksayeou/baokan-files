	Erroneous Practices of Discriminating Against Demobilized Soldiers Must Be Corrected
	The Shanxi Provincial Labor Bureau actually refuses to solve the employment problem of demobilized soldiers.
	To the Editor:
	Our Shanxi Provincial Transfer and Construction Committee has frequently and proactively contacted the Shanxi Provincial Labor Bureau in order to solve the employment problem of demobilized soldiers; however, the response we receive is always "There is no demand for people" and "They cannot be placed." After our repeated negotiations, and pointing out that the labor department should bear the responsibility for the work of resettling demobilized soldiers, they finally allowed us to send the files of demobilized soldiers for review in order to be placed. However, according to their requirements, we transferred the files of some demobilized soldiers from various parts of the province, registered them in detail, and sent them, and later repeatedly urged them to take action, but they still did not do any work on the employment problem of demobilized soldiers. Because many demobilized soldiers urgently requested to participate in work, I had no choice but to take back most of the materials that had been held in the Provincial Labor Bureau for two months and find other ways to resettle these demobilized soldiers.
	When we contacted the Provincial Labor Bureau, we requested that, in order to enable demobilized soldiers to have priority in employment, the Provincial Labor Bureau should notify us in advance of the employment situation (quantity and conditions) of various units in the future so that we could prepare early. What attitude did the Provincial Labor Bureau take towards this reasonable request? Please see a recent event: The Yangquan Mining Bureau, with the approval of its superiors, recruited 118 new apprentices. Because it could not recruit enough people in Yangquan City, it came to the Provincial Labor Bureau at the end of June with the approval of the Yangquan City Labor Bureau to request assistance. The Provincial Labor Bureau first introduced the Yangquan Mining Bureau to the Provincial Department of Industry for assistance; because the Provincial Department of Industry could not solve this problem, it instructed the Yangquan Mining Bureau to recruit personnel again in Yangquan City. After the Yangquan Mining Bureau reported to the Provincial Labor Bureau on July 7 that all personnel had been recruited, the Provincial Labor Bureau contacted our committee on the afternoon of August 2. At that time, I requested the Provincial Labor Bureau to inform the Yangquan Mining Bureau to absorb some demobilized soldiers, but the chief of the dispatch section of the Provincial Labor Bureau replied: "No, they have already been recruited (without even one demobilized soldier)." We really don't know what the Provincial Labor Bureau's intention is in not notifying us in advance and then contacting us afterwards.
	The Provincial Labor Bureau has consistently not attached importance to the work of resettling demobilized soldiers. Even after the State Council promulgated the "Decision on the Work of Resettling Demobilized Construction Soldiers," the Provincial Labor Bureau's work instructions to the Datong City Labor Bureau did not require serious implementation of the State Council's decision, but only required "referential implementation." We believe that this practice is unacceptable and request the Provincial People's Committee to investigate and deal with this issue.

	Why Doesn't the Zhejiang Provincial Personnel Bureau Approve the Admission of Demobilized Soldiers to Work?
	To the Editor:
	In April of this year, the Zhejiang Provincial Transportation Electrical Equipment Company (hereinafter referred to as Jiaodian Company) requested to add 20 salespersons. After the Provincial Personnel Bureau agreed, the Jiaodian Company, based on the principle of priority employment for demobilized soldiers, contacted the Hangzhou City Transfer and Construction Committee. After examination and physical examination, and after review by the Department of Commerce, it was prepared to employ 14 demobilized soldiers. Then the Department of Commerce reported the examination situation along with the files of the 14 demobilized soldiers to the Personnel Bureau for review and approval.
	More than twenty days passed, and there was still no approval document from the Personnel Bureau. After the Hangzhou City Transfer and Construction Committee inquired twice, a reply was finally received on May 12, saying that the higher authorities had instructed: "Internal transfer, no recruitment of personnel." The files of the 14 people were also returned intact.
	The Jiaodian Company's increase in personnel was clearly approved by the Provincial Personnel Bureau, so why is it not approved when demobilized soldiers are recruited? Comrade Li Ming, an employee of the Hangzhou City Transfer and Construction Committee, went to contact the Personnel Bureau, but Huang Zhenzhong, the person in charge of the Personnel Bureau, refused to meet him. After Li Ming repeatedly requested to see him, a comrade surnamed Zhou came out and said: "You are in charge of demobilized soldiers, and we are in charge of transferred soldiers." In this way, the employment problem of the 14 demobilized soldiers was settled.
	Similar things have happened more than once in the Provincial Personnel Bureau. In February of this year, the Jiaodian Company hired two demobilized soldiers (one of whom is a Communist Party member). Over the past three months, these two comrades have performed very well, working actively and being proficient in their business. The Jiaodian Company has long submitted a request to the Provincial Personnel Bureau to approve these two people to become formal employees. As a result, the Personnel Bureau did not approve it, and the Jiaodian Company had to keep these two people as hired employees for a long time.
	We want to ask the Zhejiang Provincial Personnel Bureau: The State Council has pointed out that properly resettling demobilized construction soldiers is a glorious political task of people's committees at all levels and the broad masses of the people. What reason does the Zhejiang Provincial Personnel Bureau have not to implement the regulations of the State Council?

	The Cadre Department of the Bureau of Building Materials Industry Should Examine Its Attitude Towards Demobilized Soldiers
	To the Editor:
	In early April of this year, the Tangshan Qixin Magnetic Factory (now renamed Tangshan Ceramic Factory) and Qixin Cement Factory, based on the recommendation of the Tangshan City Transfer and Construction Committee and the needs of the factory's production, prepared to recruit 46 demobilized soldiers. However, the cadre department of the superior agency of these two factories—the Bureau of Building Materials Industry of the Ministry of Heavy Industry—refused to approve it. Their reply was: "The introduction of demobilized soldiers to work in various factories is uniformly stipulated and allocated by the central government. We will notify you after the Ministry of Heavy Industry determines the numbers for our bureau…" "Regarding the issue of using demobilized soldiers from the military, those below the rank of platoon leader are generally not allowed to be received, and those above the rank of platoon leader can be appropriately considered according to needs." "Regarding the issue of those who worked in your factory before joining the army and now want to return to work after demobilization, you can consider receiving them, but it is best not to, and let the local government resettle them."
	The above statements are obviously wrong. Although the resolution passed by the State Council on May 31 pointed out that a portion of demobilized soldiers should be organized for collective transfer and resettlement according to the industrial system; this must not become an excuse for various units to refuse to employ other demobilized soldiers. The State Council instructed all departments to give priority to absorbing demobilized soldiers when recruiting workers, and there is no regulation that those below the rank of platoon leader are not allowed to be absorbed; most of the demobilized soldiers are below the rank of platoon leader, and only considering those above the rank of platoon leader is not the same as not absorbing demobilized soldiers? As for refusing to allow demobilized soldiers who joined the army from their original units to return to work, it is an obvious mistake.
	I believe that the cadre department of the Bureau of Building Materials Industry should correct this practice and examine their erroneous attitude towards demobilized soldiers.

	The Anyang Automobile General Station Should Not Unjustifiably Dismiss Demobilized Soldier Zhao Shixing
	To the Editor:
	I am a soldier who was demobilized in March of this year. In April, I was introduced by the Anyang City Transfer and Construction Committee to work as a repairman at the state-owned Anyang Automobile General Station. On June 4, Zhao Binghui, the director of the workshop of the Automobile General Station, suddenly stopped allowing me to continue working. He gave three reasons: first, I should not have made suggestions to the superiors at the meeting, deliberately creating antagonism with the superiors; second, my skills are low; and third, I should not have exceeded my two-day vacation.
	The former "reason" is indeed the real reason for my dismissal. It turned out that the first repair group of the workshop held a meeting on June 3 to examine the reasons for the rework of repairs and the chaos in the group's work. In order to help the leadership improve their work, I pointed out, based on my understanding of the situation, that the reasons for the rework and the chaos in the work were "the superiors do not go deep into the lower levels, the management is not strict, the investigation is not detailed, the handling of problems is not appropriate, and those who should be praised are not praised, and those who should be criticized are not criticized." Who knew that this would offend Director Zhao, and he said that I was deliberately creating antagonism with the superiors and would not allow me to continue working.
	As for the latter two "reasons," they are just excuses. Director Zhao said that my "skills are low," but three days ago (June 1), he once said to me: "The superiors want to cultivate you because you have a high level of political consciousness, you are young, and you are progressing quickly." Aren't these two statements contradictory? The actual situation of my "exceeding my vacation by two days" is: at the end of May, when I got married, the superiors approved a one-day leave, and I applied for a written extension of two days because the wedding was not completed. After returning to the station, I also made a self-criticism to Director Zhao for this matter, and Director Zhao also encouraged me to continue working hard at that time. Unexpectedly, two days later, this became the reason why he did not allow me to work.
	I think it is unreasonable for Director Zhao to treat me like this because I made a suggestion. I hope the superior authorities will properly handle this issue.
		Demobilized Construction Soldier Zhao Shixing, Anyang City, Henan

	Editor's Note: The situation reflected by reader Zhao Shixing has been investigated by the Anyang City Transfer and Construction Committee, which we entrusted, and it has been proven to be true. Zhao Shixing performed well when he worked at the Anyang Automobile General Station. The real reason for his dismissal this time was indeed because he made suggestions to the leadership at the meeting on June 3. His starting point for making suggestions was good, but the manner was relatively rigid. The Anyang City Transfer and Construction Committee has repeatedly negotiated with the Automobile General Station, pointing out that dismissing Zhao Shixing is unreasonable and that he should be allowed to return to work. However, the Automobile General Station has always insisted on its erroneous decision.
	We believe that this practice of the Anyang Automobile General Station violates the spirit of the State Council's "Decision on the Work of Resettling Demobilized Construction Soldiers" and the state's labor force allocation policy, and is very wrong. The Anyang Special Commissioner's Office should seriously handle this issue.

### 必须纠正排斥复员军人的错误做法

    必须纠正排斥复员军人的错误做法
    山西省劳动局竟拒绝解决复员军人的就业问题编辑同志：
    我们山西省转业建设委员会为了解决复员军人的就业问题，曾经常主动地同山西省劳动局联系；但是得到的答复总是用“没地方要人”“安置不下去”。经我们再三交涉，并且指出劳动部门应该对安置复员军人的工作负担应有的责任，他们才让把复员军人的档案材料送去审查，以便安置。但是，我们根据他们的要求把一些复员军人的档案材料从省内各地调来，详细登记后送去了，并且后来又多次催办，他们仍然没有对复员军人的就业问题做任何工作。由于很多复员军人迫切要求参加工作，我会不得不把在省劳动局压了两个月的大部分材料取回来，另外设法安置这些复员军人。
    我们在同省劳动局联系时，曾经提出要求：为了使复员军人能优先就业，请省劳动局将今后各单位的用人情况（数量和条件）预先通知我们，以便早作准备。省劳动局用什么态度来对待这个合理的要求呢？请看最近发生的一件事：阳泉矿务局经上级批准招收一百十八名新徒工，因为在阳泉市不能招足，就在六月底经过阳泉市劳动局批准来省劳动局请求协助。省劳动局先介绍阳泉矿务局请省工业厅协助；由于省工业厅不能解决这个问题，又指示阳泉矿务局在阳泉市再次招收人员。等到阳泉矿务局在七月七日向省劳动局报告人员已经全部招齐以后，省劳动局却在八日下午同我会联系。我会当时要求省劳动局转告阳泉矿务局吸收一部分复员军人，省劳动局调配科长答复说：“不行，那里已经招收妥当了（其中一个复员军人也没有）。”我们真不知道，省劳动局事先不通知我们，事后又同我们联系，用意究竟何在？
    省劳动局对安置复员军人的工作是一贯不重视的，甚至在国务院公布了“关于安置复员建设军人工作的决议”以后，省劳动局给大同市劳动局的工作指示中，对国务院的决议不是要求认真贯彻，只是要求“参考执行”。我们认为，这种做法是不能令人容忍的，要求省人民委员会检查并处理这个问题。　山西省转业建设委员会
    浙江省人事局为什么不批准吸收复员军人参加工作编辑同志：
    今年四月，浙江省交通电工器材公司（以下简称交电公司）要求增加二十名营业员。经省人事局同意后，交电公司根据复员军人优先就业的原则，同杭州市转业建设委员会联系，经过考试和体格检查，并经过商业厅审查，准备录用十四个复员军人。接着商业厅就把考试情况连同十四个复员军人的档案材料转报人事局审核批准。
    二十多天过去了，还不见人事局的批文。经过杭州市转业建设委员会两次催问，五月十二日才算有了答复，说是上级有指示：“内部调配，不吸收人员。”十四个人的档案材料也被原封不动地退了回来。
    交电公司增加人员明明是经过省人事局同意的，为什么招用了复员军人就不批准呢？杭州市转业建设委员会派办事员李明同志去同人事局联系，人事局经办人黄振忠竟拒绝接见。经李明再三求见，才有一位姓周的同志出来说：“你们搞复员军人的，我们搞转业军人的。”这样，十四个复员军人的就业问题就算了结。
    类似的事情在省人事局还不止一件。今年二月交电公司雇用了两个复员军人（其中有一个是共产党员）。三个月来，这两位同志表现很好，工作积极，业务熟练。交电公司早就呈请省人事局要求批准这两个人转为正式工作人员。结果人事局不批准，交电公司只得把这两个人长期作为雇用人员。
    我们要责问浙江省人事局：国务院曾指出妥善安置复员建设军人是各级人民委员会和广大人民群众的一项光荣的政治任务，浙江省人事局有什么理由可以不执行国务院的规定呢？

    建筑材料工业管理局干部处应检查对待复员军人的态度编辑同志：
    今年四月初，唐山市启新磁厂（现改名为唐山陶磁厂）和启新水泥厂，根据唐山市转业建设委员会的建议和厂里生产上的需要，准备招用四十六名复员军人。但是，这两个厂的上级机关——重工业部建筑材料工业管理局的干部处却拒绝批准。他们的答复是：“复员军人介绍到各厂工作，是由中央统一规定分配的，等到重工业部确定我局数字再行通知……。”“关于用部队复员军人问题，排级以下一般不许接收，排级以上根据需要，适当考虑。”“原在你厂工作的，参军后现在复员回来要求复工问题，可以考虑接收，最好是不要，由当地政府安置。”
    以上这些说法，显然都是错误的。国务院在五月三十一日通过的决议中虽然指出应该组织一部分复员军人集体转业，按工业系统来安置工作；但这决不能成为各单位拒绝录用其他复员军人的借口。国务院指示各部门招收工人时优先吸收复员军人，决没有排级以下不许吸收的规定；复员军人大部分是排级以下的，只考虑排级以上的做法，不也就是不吸收复员军人吗？至于拒绝由原单位参军的复员军人复工，更是明显的错误。
    我认为，建筑材料工业管理局干部处应该纠正这种做法，并且检查一下他们对待复员军人的错误态度。	　北京驻军某部复员办公室　李实
    安阳汽车总站不应该无理解雇复员军人赵士兴编辑同志：
    我是今年三月复员的军人，四月间由安阳市转业建设委员会介绍到国营安阳汽车总站做修理工。六月四日，汽车总站车间主任赵炳辉忽然不让我继续工作了。他提出三个理由：第一是我不应该在会上向上级提意见，有意同上级闹对立；第二是我技术低；第三是我不应该超过两天假期。
    前一个“理由”确是解雇我的真实原因。原来六月三日车间第一修理组召开会议，要检查修车返工和组内工作混乱的原因。为了帮助领导改进工作，我就根据我所了解的情况，指出返工和工作混乱的原因是“上级不深入下层，管理不严，调查不详细，处理问题不恰当，该表扬的未表扬，该批评的未批评”。谁知道这竟触犯了赵主任，他就说我是有意和上级闹对立，要不让我继续工作了。
    至于后两个“理由”只不过是借口罢了。赵主任说我“技术低”，但在三天前（六月一日）他还曾经对我说：“上级要培养你，因为你政治觉悟高，年轻，进步快。”这两种说法不是前后矛盾的吗？我“越假两天”的实际情况是：五月底我结婚时上级批准请假一天，因婚事没有办妥我又书面续假两天。回站后，我还为这件事向赵主任作了检讨，当时赵主任也鼓励我继续好好工作。想不到过了两天，这竟成为他不让我工作的理由了。
    我认为赵主任因为我提了个意见就这样对待我是不合理的。希望上级机关正确处理这个问题。河南安阳市复员建设军人　赵士兴
    编者按：读者赵士兴反映的情况，经我们委托安阳市转业建设委员会调查，证明是确实的。赵士兴在安阳汽车总站工作时，表现较好。这次被解雇的真实原因，确实是由于他在六月三日的会上向领导提了意见。他提意见的出发点是好的，只是方式比较生硬。安阳市转业建设委员会曾多次和汽车总站交涉，指出解雇赵士兴是不合理的，应该让他复工。但是汽车总站一直坚持自己的错误决定。
    我们认为，安阳汽车总站这种做法，违反了国务院“关于安置复员建设军人工作的决议”的精神和国家的劳动力调配政策，是十分错误的。安阳专署应该严肃处理这个问题。
