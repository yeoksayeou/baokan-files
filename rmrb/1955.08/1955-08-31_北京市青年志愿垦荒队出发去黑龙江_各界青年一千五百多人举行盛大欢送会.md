Xinhua News Agency, August 30th. The Beijing Youth Volunteer Land Reclamation Team left Beijing by train at 6:00 PM on August 30th to embrace a new life in Luobei County, Heilongjiang Province. Over 170 people went to the station to see off this group of young builders.

When land reclamation team member Pang Shuying left her hometown of Heguozhuang, her elderly mother and neighbors saw her off at the village entrance. Her mother repeatedly urged Pang Shuying, "Child! Go ahead, don't be afraid of hardship. Only through hardship can you find happiness. As long as you don't fall behind, strive for the first harvest, the second harvest... then Mom will be at ease." Before departing, Youth League member Li Shuying's mother meticulously sewed cotton clothes for her to wear through the winter, and her girlfriend Li Shuqin also came to help her sew her luggage. Li Shuqin told Li Shuying, "You go this year, and I will go next year." On the eve of Ai Tengyou's departure, the village's Youth League branch held a farewell party for him. After the meeting, his two older brothers accompanied him on a fifty-mile night walk, arriving at the Central Committee of the Youth League before dawn to report.

The Youth Volunteer Land Reclamation Team had already established its headquarters on the 28th. Leaders of the Communist Party branch and the Youth League branch were elected. Among the land reclamation team, there are sixteen Communist Party members and forty-two Youth League members, including twelve young women.

Xinhua News Agency, August 30th. Over 1,500 young people in the capital held a grand rally on the morning of August 30th to bid farewell to the Beijing Youth Volunteer Land Reclamation Team.

Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, spoke at the meeting. He said, "Our country has 1.5 billion mu of wasteland. Our youth cannot let the wasteland grow weeds; it must grow grain. We cannot let the wasteland sleep; it must serve the socialist construction of the motherland. This year you are going, and next year, the year after, even more young people will go to where you are. The Soviet Union has Komsomolsk; why can't we have a Youth City? The youth of Beijing should go to the borderlands of our great motherland to build a Youth City!" He encouraged the land reclamation team members to advance toward difficulties. He said, "If there are a thousand difficulties, break through a thousand. If there are ten thousand difficulties, break through ten thousand. Under the leadership of the Party, use your hardworking hands to create a happy life. When the National Conference of Active Builders of Socialism convenes on September 20th, we hope you will send representatives to participate in the conference and report on your land reclamation achievements." Then, Hu Yaobang, on behalf of the Central Committee of the League, presented the "Beijing Youth Volunteer Land Reclamation Team" with a red team flag. Hu Yaobang said, "This represents the expectations of 120 million young people across the country for you. We hope you will hold this flag and advance bravely!" At this time, all the members of the land reclamation team walked onto the podium amidst warm applause, and Yang Hua accepted this glorious flag on behalf of the land reclamation team.

Yang Shu, a member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. He encouraged the young volunteer land reclamation team members to overcome all difficulties for the socialist construction of the great motherland, rely on their own hard work, establish their own lives, and set an example for those who come later. Wang Zhaohua, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, reported on the enthusiastic participation of Beijing youth in the land reclamation team and the enthusiastic support of Beijing youth for the land reclamation team. In just two weeks, 564 young people in Beijing applied to join the land reclamation team. Young people from more than 60 units supported the land reclamation team with a total of 69,698 yuan in cash.

Li Youzhi, a worker from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, gave a farewell message to the land reclamation team members on behalf of the youth of Beijing. Ji Jingrong, a representative of the Beijing Young Pioneers, recited a passionate dedication, which said: "Dear older brothers and sisters, we are waiting for your good news. The first tree you plant, the first well you dig, the first seedlings that appear, are all news we crave... We must also learn from your example and be ready at all times..."

After the meeting, the Central Experimental Opera House performed wonderful songs and dances for the land reclamation team, and sang a song specially written for them, "We are Volunteer Land Reclamation Team Members." (Attached picture)

　　北京市青年志愿垦荒队出发去黑龙江
　　各界青年一千五百多人举行盛大欢送会
    新华社三十日讯　北京市青年志愿垦荒队三十日下午六时乘车离开北京，到黑龙江省萝北县去迎接新的生活。有一百七十多人到车站去欢送这批青年建设者。
    垦荒队队员庞淑英在离开自己的家乡——何各庄的时候，她的年老的母亲和街坊邻居将她送到了村头。她妈妈再三叮嘱庞淑英说：“孩子！你去吧，不要怕吃苦，有苦才有幸福，只要你不落人后，争取第一个丰收，第二个丰收……妈妈就放心了。”青年团员李淑英出发前，她的妈妈为她细针密线地缝制过冬的棉衣，她的女朋友李淑琴也来帮助她缝制行装。李淑琴告诉李淑英说：“你今年去，明年我也要去。”艾腾友在临行前的夜晚，村里的青年团支部为他开了欢送会。会后，他的两个哥哥伴送着他步行了五十里的夜路，在天明前赶到青年团中央报到。
    青年志愿垦荒队已在二十八日成立了自己的队部。选出了共产党支部、青年团支部的领导人。垦荒队当中有十六名共产党员、四十二名青年团员，其中有十二名女青年。
    新华社三十日讯　首都一千五百多个青年在三十日上午举行盛大集会，欢送北京市青年志愿垦荒队。
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡耀邦在会上讲话。他说：“我们的国家有十五万万亩荒地，我们青年不能让荒地长野草，一定要它生长出粮食来，我们不能让荒地睡大觉，一定让它为祖国社会主义建设服务。今年你们走了，明年，后年还要有更多的青年到你们那里去。苏联有共青城，我们为什么不能有青年城呢？北京的青年应该到伟大祖国的边疆去建设起一个青年城来。”他鼓舞垦荒队队员们要向困难进军。他说：“有一千条困难就打破一千条，有一万条困难就打破一万条，在党的领导下，用你们劳动的双手，创造出幸福的生活。在九月二十日召开全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的时候，希望你们派代表来参加大会，报告你们的开垦成绩。”接着，胡耀邦代表团中央授予“北京市青年志愿垦荒队”一面红色的队旗。胡耀邦说：“这代表着全国一亿二千万个青年对你们的期望，希望你们举着这面旗帜英勇前进！”这时，全体垦荒队队员在热烈的掌声中走上主席台，杨华代表垦荒队接受了这面光荣的旗帜。
    中国共产党北京市委员会委员杨述到会讲话，他勉励青年志愿垦荒队员为了伟大祖国的社会主义建设事业，克服一切困难，依靠自己的艰苦劳动，建立自己的生活，为后来的人作出榜样。中国新民主主义青年团北京市委员会第二书记王照华在会上报告了北京市青年踊跃参加垦荒队以及北京市青年热烈支援垦荒队的情况。两个星期中仅北京市的青年报名要求参加垦荒队的就有五百六十四人。六十多个单位的青年支援垦荒队的现金共达六万九千六百九十八元。
    石景山钢铁厂工人李友芝代表北京市青年向垦荒队队员作了临别赠言。北京市少年先锋队代表吉敬容朗诵了热情的献词，献词中说：“亲爱的大哥哥大姐姐们，我们等待着你们的捷报，你们种下的第一棵树，打下的第一口井，第一次出现的青苗，都是我们渴望的消息……我们也要学习你们的榜样，时刻准备着……。”
    会后，中央实验歌剧院为垦荒队演出了精采的歌舞，并唱了特地为他们写的歌曲“我们是志愿垦荒队员”。（附图片）
