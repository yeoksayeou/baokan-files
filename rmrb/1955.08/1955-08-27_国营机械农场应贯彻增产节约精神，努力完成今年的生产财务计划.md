    State-owned Mechanical Farms Should Implement the Spirit of Increasing Production and Practicing Economy, and Strive to Fulfill This Year's Production and Financial Plan
　　Guo Nong
      The production tasks of state-owned mechanical farms in 1955 are arduous. The cultivated land area is required to increase from 2.82 million mu last year to 4,334,400 mu, with a sown area of 3 million mu, producing 620 million jin of grain, 3.6 million jin of ginned cotton, and raising 40,000 pigs. Striving to complete these tasks is of great significance to the development of state-owned farms and the completion of the entire agricultural production plan.
    The implementation of the plan by various farms in the first half of the year was not good enough. According to incomplete statistics from 96 farms, the sowing plan was 99 percent complete, which is generally not bad, but the yield plan completion was relatively poor. The winter wheat of most farms generally only completed about 70 percent of the planned yield, with an average reduction of about 30 percent. Only 12 farms completed or exceeded the planned yield. Individual farms, due to natural disasters, extensive planting, and other reasons, completed the plan even worse. For example, Xijiang Farm in Guangxi and Shanjing Farm in Guizhou did not even recover their seeds.
    In terms of pig raising, according to incomplete statistics from 84 farms, the total number of pigs raised by the second quarter had completed 75 percent of the total task, an increase of 57.6 percent compared with the end of 1954. The number of sows also increased by 68.43 percent compared with the end of 1954, and more than 6,500 live pigs have been supplied to the market. However, in a considerable number of farms, there are still phenomena of insufficient feed, lax epidemic prevention systems, and poor feeding management, resulting in pig deaths. To complete this year's pig-raising task, a lot of effort is still needed.
    The reasons for the poor completion of the production and financial plan, in addition to natural disasters such as drought, flood, wind, and insects in individual farms, are mainly problems in business management. Many farms are poorly managed, livestock are not well raised, technical measures are inappropriate, and losses and waste are serious. The plan itself being divorced from reality is also an important reason. Many farm leaders lack the idea of enterprise management, cannot conscientiously implement the principle of increasing production and practicing economy, and some farms that were once profitable have become blindly optimistic and complacent because of small achievements and no longer strive forward; some farms emphasize difficult natural conditions and do not actively find ways to overcome difficulties; some farms believe that the implementation of the plan in the first half of the year was not good enough, and then generate negative thoughts such as "losing money is a foregone conclusion", and no longer think about making up for the losses in the first half of the year, and so on. These various wrong ideas have seriously affected the implementation of the production and financial plan.
    From the perspective of the production season, there is still a period of time that can be used to strive to complete and overfulfill this year's production and financial plan is entirely possible. Farms in the Yangtze River Basin and South China have good climates and more favorable conditions. As long as we earnestly implement the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, mobilize all employees to think of ways, find tricks, tap potential, calculate carefully, find all possible conditions for increasing production, practice strict economy, and reduce waste, there is still a lot that can be done. For example, Lingwu Farm, which has relatively poor conditions, estimates that it can increase production and save more than 70,000 yuan in the second half of the year. Shuangqiao Farm felt strained to complete the original planned profit. After various new measures, it is estimated that it can complete and exceed the original plan. Dongxin Farm in Jiangsu, which suffered a severe drought, originally calculated that it would lose 100,000 yuan. After implementing the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, it can reduce the loss by 80,000 yuan. If it makes another effort, it can strive to achieve a balance of payments. All farms must seize the opportunity, analyze the implementation of the plan in the first half of the year, and then carefully study the farm's natural and economic conditions, mobilize employees to take various effective measures, replant late autumn and short-term crops, strengthen field management, and strive to complete and overfulfill this year's production and financial plan.
    At present, the spring-sown crops in various farms are generally growing well, but to achieve a bumper harvest, unremitting efforts must be made. Do a good job in preventing drought, draining waterlogging, preventing floods, actively cultivating and weeding, processing and applying fertilizer, preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests in a timely manner, turning and pressing green manure at the right time, conducting crop ranking, finding out the reasons for the good or bad growth of different fields, taking effective measures to raise low-yield fields to the level of high-yield fields, and further strengthening field management in high-yield fields to strive for a bumper harvest. All farms where natural conditions are suitable and can plant another season should make full use of the available land, increase the multiple cropping area, and improve the land utilization rate. However, it is also necessary to prevent the wrong practice of planting blindly regardless of the farming season. We must establish a comprehensive viewpoint of increasing production and practicing economy, and unify technical measures with increasing yield and reducing costs. The practice of only focusing on increasing production without considering costs, or unilaterally reducing costs regardless of yield, should be prevented.
    Harvesting is the most complex and important task in farm production. "Timely harvesting is victory." In the past, some farms did not organize the harvesting work well, did not prepare enough tools and materials, did not seize the time tightly, and ignored the quality of harvesting, resulting in great losses. For example, the state-owned Xijiang Farm lost about 200,000 jin of early rice last year, and the "September 3rd" Rongjun, Tongbei, and Hongxing farms lost more than 100 jin per hectare in harvesting. The Chahayang Farm can still pick out more than 200 jin of rice per person per day from the harvested rice fields. Farms in various places must learn from these lessons, organize well, prepare early, strengthen technical guidance, give full play to the effectiveness of machinery, harvest carefully, dry and store in time, and reduce losses during the harvesting and storage process.
    This year, various farms have implemented the spirit of the National State-owned Farm Conference and vigorously developed animal husbandry, especially pig raising, which is very good. However, judging from the livestock breeding situation in various farms in the past six months, many farms have not deeply understood the important significance of combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and have not paid enough attention to animal husbandry business. Taking pig raising as an example, there are few births, many deaths, and slow growth, resulting in serious losses and waste. For example, the mortality rate of the 700 pigs purchased by Caobuhu Farm was as high as 55 percent; the mortality rate of piglets born in Panshan Farm in the first half of the year was as high as 58 percent. The mortality rate of sheep in Lingwu Farm this spring reached about 40 percent. Losses in animal husbandry have brought great difficulties to the completion of this year's production and financial plan. Reducing losses in this area is an urgent task. We must do a good job in group feeding of livestock, make full use of agricultural by-products and waste as feed, make silage, and store winter feed for livestock. Doing a good job in livestock epidemic prevention and paying attention to environmental hygiene are effective measures to reduce livestock diseases and deaths. Animal husbandry should also pay attention to reducing costs and prevent the simple task view of only focusing on developing the number of heads and ignoring costs.
    This year's investment in basic construction of farms still accounts for a considerable proportion, and it is necessary to re-approve the construction plan and basic construction plan in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's strict implementation of comprehensive economy and opposition to waste. At present, many farms lack careful planning, do not proceed from production, do not follow procedures, and blindly construct, so the situation of waste is still very serious. For example, Xijiang Farm blindly built a large-scale starch processing plant, but the raw materials produced by the farm can only supply more than half a month of processing, and the processing capacity cannot be brought into play. Nanpingwan Farm lacked necessary surveys before construction, invested more than 500,000 yuan to build the farm, and only discovered this year that there were problems with water conservancy conditions and it was closed down, resulting in a great loss. In addition, some farms one-sidedly emphasize "a century-old plan" and blindly pursue "modernization" standards, which is also very alarming. For example, the cowsheds and pigsties built by Shuangqiao Farm in 1953 were once called "cow mansions and pig mansions" because of their high standards and too much money; however, when building pig and chicken sheds last year, they repeated the previous mistakes, with asphalt floors, cement partition walls, and arched roofs, costing as much as 46 to 70 yuan per square meter. Another example is that Datonghu Farm built relatively expensive offices and staff dormitories, but the repair shops urgently needed for production were not built. This kind of practice of ignoring production, blindly constructing, and pursuing form is completely wrong. All farms must resolutely implement the principles of "making do with what is available" and "adapting to local conditions", proceed from production needs, re-examine the construction plan in a realistic manner according to the spirit of "economy and applicability", resolutely eliminate unnecessary projects, and appropriately lower the standards that are too high. The projects and construction sites under construction should also be comprehensively inspected, the unreasonable parts of the design should be corrected, management costs should be saved, and construction costs should be reduced as much as possible.
    It should be pointed out that at present, many farms have chaotic financial management, and the phenomenon of losses, waste, and no one being responsible is still very serious. For example, Dongxin Farm had 90,000 yuan of working capital that was accumulated for a whole year in 1954 without any turnover; Zhujiang Farm purchased 185,000 jin of soybean cake in 1954, which was accumulated for half a year, and no one in the finance and marketing departments knew about it. The losses and waste caused by violations of natural laws in production are even more serious. The phenomena of large stalls, too many people, and overstaffing are also problems that should be paid attention to in some farms. All state-owned farm workers must take the attitude of masters, resolutely fight against these losses and waste, save all non-productive expenses, strictly control the financial system, control expenditures, strengthen economic accounting, and eliminate all losses and waste.
    The production and financial plan of state-owned farms is one of the components of the national agricultural development plan. Whether the plan is completed or not is related to the realization of the entire national plan. The leaders and all employees of each farm must carefully check the problems existing in their own farms and strive for the completion and overfulfillment of this year's production and financial plan.

    国营机械农场应贯彻增产节约精神，努力完成今年的生产财务计划
　　郭农
      一九五五年国营机械农场的生产任务是繁重的，耕地面积要求由去年的二百八十二万亩增至四百三十三万四千亩，播种面积三百万亩，生产粮食六亿二千万斤，皮棉三百六十万斤，养猪四万头。争取这些任务的完成，对国营农场事业的发展和整个农业生产计划的完成，都有重大的意义。
    上半年各场计划执行的情况是不够好的。据九十六个农场的不完全统计，播种计划完成了百分之九十九，一般说还不算坏，但产量计划完成则较差。大多数农场的冬小麦，一般只完成计划产量的百分之七十上下，即平均约减产三成。只有十二个农场完成或超额完成计划产量。个别农场由于自然灾害、种植粗放等原因，完成计划更差，如广西西江农场、贵州山京农场，甚至连种子也没有收回来。
    在养猪方面，据八十四个农场不完全统计，到第二季度养猪总头数已完成总任务百分之七十五，比一九五四年年底增加了百分之五十七点六，母猪亦比一九五四年年底增加了百分之六十八点四三，并已供应市场生猪六千五百多口。但是，在相当一部分农场中还有饲料不足、防疫制度不严、饲养管理不善以致造成猪只死亡的现象，要完成今年养猪的任务，还需要作很大的努力。
    生产财务计划完成不好的原因，除个别农场因旱、涝、风、虫等自然灾害外，主要还是经营管理方面的问题。许多农场经营管理不善，牲畜饲养不好，技术措施不适当，损失浪费严重。计划本身脱离实际也是一个重要原因。不少农场的领导人员，缺乏企业化经营思想，不能认真贯彻增产节约的原则，有些曾经生产有利的场，因微小的成就，盲目乐观，骄傲自满，不再努力前进；有些场强调自然条件困难，不主动想办法去克服困难；有些场认为上半年计划执行不够好，就产生“赔钱成定局”等消极思想，不再想法弥补上半年损失等等。这种种错误思想，都严重影响到生产财务计划的贯彻执行。
    从生产季节来看，现在还有一段时间可利用，争取完成和超额完成今年生产财务计划是完全可能的。长江流域和华南地区的农场，气候良好、有利条件更多。只要切实贯彻增产节约的精神，发动全体职工想办法、找窍门、挖潜力、算细账、寻找一切可能增产的条件，厉行节约，减少浪费，也还是大有可为的。如条件较差的灵武农场下半年估计即可增产节约七万多元。双桥农场完成原计划利润感觉吃力，经过种种新措施后，估计可以完成和超过原计划。遭受旱灾较重的江苏东辛农场，原来计算要亏十万元，在贯彻增产节约精神以后，可以少亏八万元，如再努一把力，是可以力争收支平衡的。各场必须抓紧时机，在分析上半年计划执行情况的基础之上，认真研究农场的自然条件和经济条件，动员职工采取各项有效措施，补种晚秋和短期作物，加强田间管理，力争完成和超额完成今年的生产财务计划。
    目前各场春播作物一般生长良好，但取得丰收还必须作不懈的努力。做好防旱排涝防汛，积极中耕除草，加工施肥，及时预防病虫害，适时翻压绿肥，进行作物排队，找出不同田块生长好坏的原因，采取有效措施，把低产田提高到高产田的水平，高产田要进一步加强田间管理，争取丰收。凡是自然条件适宜，还可以多种一季的场子，应把可以利用的土地全部利用起来，增加复种面积，提高土地利用率。但也必须防止不顾农时，盲目种植的错误做法。必须树立全面增产节约观点，把技术措施和提高产量、降低成本统一起来，只顾增产不问成本，或不顾产量片面降低成本的做法，都应该防止。
    收获是农场生产中最复杂最重要的工作。“收获及时就是胜利”。过去有些场收获工作组织不好，工具物资准备不够，时间抓得不紧，忽视收割质量，损失是很大的。如国营西江农场去年收获早稻丢失浪费即达二十万斤左右，“九三”荣军、通北、红星等农场每公顷收割损失都在百斤以上。查哈阳农场从收割后的稻田里每人一天还能拣出稻谷二百多斤。各地农场必须接受这些教训，很好组织，及早准备，加强技术指导，充分发挥机具效能，细收细打，及时晒干储藏，减少收割和储藏过程的损耗。
    今年各场贯彻国营农场会议精神，大力发展了养畜业，特别是养猪，这是很好的。但从各场半年来牲畜饲养情况来看，不少农场对农牧结合的重要意义体会不深，对畜牧业务重视是不够的。以养猪来说，生的少、死的多、长的慢，损失浪费情况严重。如草埠湖农场购进七百口猪，死亡率高达百分之五十五；盘山农场上半年生的小猪死亡率高达百分之五十八。灵武农场今年春天羊子死亡达百分之四十左右。牧畜方面的损失，给今年完成生产财务计划带来极大的困难。畜牧生产本是农场重要收益之一，减少这一方面的损失，是当前刻不容缓的工作。必须做好牲畜分群饲养，尽量利用农业副产品和废品作饲料，制作青贮，为牲畜储备过冬饲料。做好畜疫预防工作，重视环境卫生，是减少家畜疫病和死亡的有效措施。畜牧业同样应注意降低成本，防止只顾发展头数不计成本的单纯任务观点。
    农场今年基本建设的投资，还占相当大的比重，必须根据中央厉行全面节约、反对浪费的精神，重新审批建场计划和基本建设计划。当前不少农场缺乏周密计划，不从生产出发，不按程序办事，盲目建设，因而造成浪费的情况还是十分严重的。如西江农场盲目修建一所规模宏大的淀粉加工厂，而该场生产的原料仅能供应半月多加工之用，加工能力无法发挥。南屏垸农场建场前缺乏必要的勘测，投资五十多万元建场，今年才发现水利条件有问题而停办，造成了很大损失。另外有些场片面强调“百年大计”，盲目追求“现代化”标准，浪费也是很惊人的。如双桥农场一九五三年修建的牛舍、猪舍，曾因标准过高、花钱太多，有“牛公馆、猪公馆”之称；但去年修建猪、鸡舍，又重犯以前错误，猪舍用柏油地、水泥隔墙、拱式房顶，造价每平方公尺高达四十六元到七十元。又如大通湖农场修建了造价较高的办公室和工作人员宿舍，而生产上迫切需要的修理间却没有修建。这种不顾生产，盲目建设，追求形式的作法是完全错误的。各场必须坚决贯彻“因陋就简”、“因地制宜”的原则，从生产需要出发，根据“经济、适用”的精神，实事求是地重新审查建设计划，坚决削除不必要的项目，标准太高的应适当降低。对正在建设中的工程和工地，亦应进行全面检查，纠正设计中的不合理部分，节省管理费用，力求降低造价。
    应该指出，目前许多农场财务管理混乱，损失浪费和无人负责现象还很严重。如东辛农场一九五四年有九万元的流动资金整整积压了一年未作任何周转；珠江农场一九五四年购入豆饼结存十八万五千斤，积压半年，财务、供销两科无人知道。生产上违反自然规律所造成的损失浪费更为严重。摊子大、人员多、人浮于事的现象，也是部分农场中应加注意的问题。所有国营农场职工都要以主人翁态度，坚决同这些损失浪费现象作斗争，节约一切非生产性的费用，严密财务制度，控制开支，加强经济核算，杜绝一切损失浪费。
    国营农场生产财务计划是国家农业发展计划组成部分之一，计划完成与否，关系着国家整个计划的实现，各个农场的领导者和全体职工都必须认真检查自己农场存在的问题，争取今年生产财务计划的完成和超额完成。
