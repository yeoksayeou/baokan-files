Xinhua News Agency, August 24th - According to United States Information Service reports: Indian Ambassador to the United States, Mehta, was unreasonably subjected to racial discrimination in the United States on the 22nd, while en route from Washington to Mexico, at a public cafeteria at the Houston, Texas, airport, where he was treated as a black man and refused service.

When Mehta and his secretary, Jagopalan, stopped at the public cafeteria at the airport to change planes, the cafeteria manager demanded that they leave the cafeteria and go to another hidden small room. According to eyewitnesses at the time, the manager said that if they did not leave, he would "have to send someone to force them to leave. The law is the law." Eyewitnesses said that the manager regarded Mehta and Jagopalan as American blacks. Texas law prohibits serving blacks and whites in the same room.

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles has sent telegrams to the Indian Embassy in the United States and the Indian government, expressing his apologies regarding this matter. Houston Mayor Hofheinz also sent a telegram to Mehta, expressing "apologies and regret."

　　印度驻美国大使梅达　在美国遭到无理的种族歧视
    新华社二十四日讯　据美国新闻处消息：印度驻美国大使梅达二十二日从华盛顿前往墨西哥途中，在得克萨斯州豪斯敦城飞机场的公共食堂里被当作黑人而拒绝予以接待。
    当梅达和他的秘书贾戈帕兰为了换飞机而在这个飞机场的公共食堂停留时，食堂的管理人要求他们离开食堂到另一个隐蔽的小房间里去。据当时的目击者谈，这个管理人说：如果他们不离开，就“将不得不派人强迫他们离开。法律就是法律”。目击者说，这个管理人把梅达和贾戈帕兰看做是美国黑人。得克萨斯州法律禁止在同一个房间里接待黑人和白人。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯已就这件事向印度驻美大使馆和印度政府发出电报，表示道歉。豪斯敦市长霍夫梅也打电报给梅达，表示“道歉和遗憾”。
