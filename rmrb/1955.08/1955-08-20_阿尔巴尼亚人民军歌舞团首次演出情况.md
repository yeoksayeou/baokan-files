The beautiful music, songs, and dance performances brought from distant Tirana by the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble were warmly welcomed at their premiere in Beijing on the evening of the 18th. The grand occasion and the applause and cheers that repeatedly echoed throughout the hall were simultaneously broadcast to the vast audience of the capital by the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station.

The first part of the evening was a grand chorus. The choir, composed of about seventy singers, performed ten songs from Albania, China, and the Soviet Union. These songs included majestic marches, lyrical folk songs, and songs from Russian classical operas. The Albanian singers perfectly expressed the emotions of these songs with their healthy, simple, and bright tones. The choir first sang "First Division March" and then "Song of Hero Asim Zeneli." These two songs praise the People's Army and immortal heroes who made great contributions in the Albanian liberation struggle. They demonstrated the heroic spirit of the Albanian people with majestic harmonies and powerful rhythms. Two Albanian folk songs in the grand chorus, "Speak! Speak!" and "Is there water in this spring?", were filled with joyous and lively atmosphere and strong lyrical flavor. After repeated curtain calls, the performers reprised "Speak! Speak!". The choir also successfully performed the Chinese songs "The East is Red" and "People of the World are of One Heart", winning lasting applause from the audience and reprising a section of "The East is Red" at the audience's request. The grand chorus concluded with the Glory Chorus from the opera "Ivan Susanin," which elicited prolonged applause from the audience, and the performers took repeated curtain calls.

The second part of the song and dance performance began with "South Albanian Suite". A group of girls in beautiful costumes appeared before the audience with gentle steps. They danced together with another group of young people who had healthy and powerful steps. In the "Mogitka Tribe Suite," male and female dancers repeatedly twirled, and finally performed a collective dance, demonstrating the people's brave struggle against the feudal class to maintain their marriage customs. The "Tirana Suite," composed of some lyrical and beautiful Tirana dances, expressed the joyous and happy mood of young people when they get married. This suite has strong national characteristics. The rhythm of the dance changes from light and fast to slow, and finally ends in a joyous beat.

During the evening, the Albanian artists' male solos, female solos, and duets all perfectly expressed the lyrical mood in the songs. The Albanian folk songs and Chinese folk songs sung by female vocalist Maria Kraja were warmly welcomed. Male soloist Avni Mula reprised the Chinese folk song "In That Distant Place" for the audience. Male soloist Stavri Nafaeli also repeated the performance of a selection from the opera "Rigoletto".

The last program of the song and dance performance, the "Zërqan Suite," describes the simple life of the residents of the Zërqan mountainous area in northeastern Albania, with its lofty mountains. The performers expressed the heroic and courageous character of the Albanian people and their love for a happy life with enthusiastic, joyful, and unrestrained dance moves.

The song and dance performance lasted from 8:00 PM to 11:40 PM. Literary and art workers from the land, sea, and air forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and young literary and art workers from Beijing went to the stage to present flower baskets and flowers to the members of the song and dance troupe as thanks. At this time, the entire audience stood up, and sustained applause echoed throughout the hall. The stage and the audience cheered "Mao Zedong!" "Hoxha!" in unison.

During the intermission of tonight's song and dance performance, Vice Premier of the State Council Peng Dehuai and others went backstage to meet with members of the song and dance troupe to express their welcome and regards.
