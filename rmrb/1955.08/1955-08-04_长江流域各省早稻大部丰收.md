    Major Early Rice Harvests in Provinces of the Yangtze River Basin
    Farmers in provinces of the Yangtze River basin are busily harvesting early rice, with most areas showing increased production compared to 1954. Jiangxi Province has experienced a major early rice harvest; in Shangrao Prefecture, with over 2.8 million mu of early rice, the average yield per mu is nearly 20% higher than in 1954, except for areas affected by mountain floods that experienced reduced production.
    On the Dongting Lake Plain in Hunan Province, which was hit by severe floods last year, tens of thousands of farmers are currently harvesting early rice in the polders surrounded by new dikes. From morning till night, the sound of rice threshing reverberates across the fields. The wide dike tops have become temporary threshing grounds, with piles of golden grain lined up one after another. To store the new grain, many agricultural producers' cooperatives members are rushing to build temporary warehouses overnight. Based on the current harvest, production is expected to increase by about 10% compared to the bumper year of 1953. In counties such as Nanxian, Yuanjiang, and Hanshou, the average yield of early rice is over 450 jin per mu, with some reaching as high as 700 jin; in Xiangxiang County in the Xiang River basin, the yield of early rice on over 24,000 mu mostly exceeds 500 jin per mu.
    Hubei Province's early rice production is expected to increase by 10% compared to 1953, with a 20% to 30% increase in the Jingjiang flood diversion area. After successive harvests of wheat and early rice in the disaster-stricken areas of Hubei Province last year, most farmers can now meet their own grain needs, and many even have surpluses. Jianli County, a severely affected area last year, reported that among the 6,400 households in seven townships including Heqiao and Jianghe, over 2,900 households have surplus grain after the summer harvest, in addition to those who are self-sufficient.
    Anhui Province has experienced a widespread early rice harvest. In Hexian County, the average yield of over 6,000 mu of harvested early rice is 450 jin per mu.

    长江流域各省早稻大部丰收
    长江流域各省农民正在紧张收割早稻，大部地区比一九五四年增产。江西省早稻大部丰收；其中上饶专区二百八十多万亩早稻，除部分受山洪冲袭而减产外，平均每亩可比一九五四年增产近两成。
    去年被大水袭击过的湖南省洞庭湖滨平原上，目前在新堤环抱着的垸田里，成千上万的农民正在收割早稻。从早到晚，咚咚的打谷声响彻着田野。宽大的堤顶成了临时的晒谷场，金黄色的谷堆一个接连一个。为了收藏新谷，许多农业生产合作社的社员漏夜赶建临时仓库。根据目前收割的情况来看，比丰收的一九五三年还要增产一成左右。南县、沅江、汉寿等县的早稻，一般每亩产量在四百五十斤以上，最高达七百斤；湘江流域湘乡县二万四千多亩早稻，每亩产量大多可以超过五百斤。
    湖北省早稻可比一九五三年增产一成，荆江分洪区的早稻可增产两成到三成。湖北省去年水灾地区在小麦和早稻相继登场后，大部分农民所需粮食已能自给，许多农民还有积余。监利县是去年的重灾区，据何桥、姜河等七个乡的统计，夏收后六千四百多户农民中，除能自给者外，二千九百多户有了余粮。
    安徽省早稻普遍丰收，和县已收获的六千多亩早稻，平均每亩产四百五十斤。
