A high-voltage power line with high voltage and large capacity is about to be completed in the suburbs of Lanzhou.

Tall iron towers have been installed on the hillsides, across wide river gullies, and at corners. Cement poles and wooden towers have also been erected. The substations at both ends of the line have long been completed. Now workers are stringing wires high in the air. Soon, a powerful current will pass through this line to power large machinery such as tower cranes, winches, and cement mixers on the construction sites.

This is currently the highest voltage high-voltage power line in the Northwest region. It starts from the Lanzhou Power Plant, passes through eight or nine kilometers of hillside, crosses many large river gullies, and leads to the construction sites of several large enterprises under construction. Originally, these construction sites could only use small generators to solve the problem of lighting, and large machinery could not be used due to limited power sources. The completion of this line will help them overcome their current difficulties; after these factories are put into production, this power line will also supply electricity for industrial production.

### 兰州市郊架设一条高压电线

    兰州市郊架设一条高压电线
    在兰州市郊区即将有一条电压高、容量大的高压电线工程完工。
    高大的铁塔已在山头上、跨度很宽的河沟两岸、转角处安装好，水泥杆和木塔也已栽好。线路两端的变电所早已完工。现在工人正在高空挂线。不久，强大的电流就要通过这条线路发动起工地的塔式起重机、卷扬机、水泥搅拌器等大型机械。
    目前这是西北地区压力最高的一条高压电线。它从兰州电厂开始，经过八、九公里的山坡，跨过许多大河沟，通到正在动工修建的几个大型企业的工地。原来这些工地只能使用小型发电机解决照明问题，大型机械则因动力来源受限制不能使用。这条线路建成，将帮助它们克服目前困难；这些工厂投入生产以后，这条电线又将为工业生产供应电力。（本报驻兰州记者）
