After the meeting, the full text of the joint communiqué, agreed upon by both sides, was released as follows:
    “The ambassadors of the People's Republic of China and the United States of America held the first meeting in Geneva on August 1, 1955. After mutual consultation, an agreement was reached on the agenda for the talks as follows:
    1. The issue of civilians returning to their respective countries;
    2. Other practical issues in dispute between the two sides.
    It is agreed that the next meeting will be held at 10:00 AM on August 2nd.”

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, August 2nd: The ambassadorial talks between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America began at 4:00 PM on the 1st in the Palais des Nations here.

The Chinese side attending the talks included Wang Bingnan, the Chinese Ambassador to Poland, assistants Li Huichuan and Lin Ping, and interpreter Qiu Yingjue. The American side attending the talks included U. Alexis Johnson, the US Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, assistant Ralph Clough, and interpreter Lou Echvarl. The formal talks began after the photographers completed their work and left the venue.

Ambassador Wang Bingnan spoke first. He said:

    "Mr. Ambassador:

    Before we begin our discussions, I am instructed to inform you of the following news. The Chinese government, following Chinese legal procedures, decided on July 31 to release ahead of schedule eleven American airmen, including Arnold. They left Beijing on July 31 and are expected to arrive in Hong Kong on August 4. I hope that this measure taken by the Chinese government will have a favorable impact on our talks.

    Our two governments, through consultation, have agreed to hold these ambassadorial talks to help resolve the issue of civilians returning to their respective countries and to further discuss and resolve certain other practical issues currently in dispute between the two sides. I sincerely hope that our talks will contribute to easing the tension between China and the United States, and thereby also contribute to the cause of maintaining world peace and security. I firmly believe that with our joint efforts, our talks can achieve this significant goal.

    Over the past year, our consular representatives have held talks in accordance with our agreement during last year's Geneva Conference, exchanging materials regarding civilians from both sides in each other's countries. Although the results of the year's talks have not been entirely satisfactory, I believe you will agree that we should commend the efforts made by our respective consular representatives. In our current talks, as long as both sides adopt an attitude of consultation and reconciliation, a reasonable solution to the issue of civilians returning to their respective countries should not present any difficulties.

    Our talks should not only discuss the issue of civilians returning to their respective countries but also other issues. Because there are indeed some other issues between China and the United States that urgently need to be discussed and resolved. Therefore, I suggest the following agenda for our talks:

        1. The issue of civilians returning to their respective countries;
        2. Other practical issues in dispute between the two sides.

    We believe that in discussing the second item on the agenda, each party can raise issues that it believes should be discussed and are directly related to China and the United States, so that both sides can freely exchange opinions.

    I would like to hear your views on this agenda that I have proposed."

After Ambassador Wang Bingnan's speech, US Representative Ambassador Johnson made a brief speech. He said he was "pleased and grateful" for the news that Ambassador Wang Bingnan had notified him of.

Based on the Chinese representative's proposal, an agreement was reached on the agenda issue, and the meeting adjourned at 4:50 PM until 10:00 AM on the 2nd.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, August 2nd: The ambassadorial talks between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America held their second meeting at the Palais des Nations on the morning of the 2nd.

A joint communiqué issued after the meeting is as follows:

    "The Ambassador of the People's Republic of China and the Ambassador of the United States of America held their second meeting in Geneva on August 2, 1955.

    They discussed the first item on the agenda (the issue of civilians returning to their respective countries).

    They agreed that the next meeting will be held at 10:00 AM on August 4."

    中美两国大使级会谈开始举行
    双方在共同协商后对会谈议程取得了协议
    新华社日内瓦二日电　中华人民共和国与美利坚合众国两国大使级会谈于一日下午四时在此间国联大厦开始举行。
    会后发表双方一致同意的会议公报全文如下：
    “中华人民共和国与美利坚合众国两国大使于一九五五年八月一日在日内瓦举行了第一次会议，在共同协商后对这次会谈的议程取得了协议如下：
    一、双方平民回国问题；
    二、双方有所争执的其他实际问题。
    兹协议下次会议在八月二日上午十时举行。”
    新华社日内瓦二日电　中华人民共和国与美利坚合众国两国大使级会谈于一日下午四时在此间国联大厦开始举行。
    中国方面出席会谈的有中国驻波兰大使王炳南，助理李汇川、林平和译员邱应觉。美国方面出席会谈的有美国驻捷克斯洛伐克大使亚·约翰逊，助理拉尔夫·克拉夫，译员鲁·埃克瓦尔。在摄影记者工作完毕离开会场后，会谈正式开始。
    王炳南大使首先发言。他说：
    “大使先生：
    在我们开始讨论以前，我奉命通知你下述消息。中国政府在七月三十一日按照中国的法律程序，决定提前释放阿诺德等十一名美国飞行人员。他们已经在七月三十一日离开北京，估计在八月四日可以到达香港。我希望，中国政府所采取的这个措施，将对我们的会谈起有利的影响。
    我们两国政府经过协商，同意举行这次大使级的会谈，以便有助于双方平民回国问题的解决，并有利于进一步讨论和解决双方之间目前有所争执的某些其他实际问题。我诚恳地希望，我们的会谈将对和缓中美之间的紧张局势，从而也对维护世界和平和安全的事业，有所贡献。我深信，在我们共同努力下，我们的会谈是能够实现这一具有重要意义的目标的。
    过去一年中，我们的领事级代表们曾经根据我们去年在日内瓦会议期间的协议，进行了会谈，互相交换了有关双方在对方国家中的平民的材料。虽然一年来会谈的结果并不能完全令人满意，但是我相信，你也一定会同意，我们对于双方领事级代表们所曾作的努力，还是应该表示赞扬的。在我们这次会谈中，只要我们双方都采取协商和和解的态度，双方平民回国问题的合理解决是不应该有任何困难的。
    我们的这次会谈不仅应该讨论双方平民回国问题，同时也应该讨论其他一些问题。因为中美两国之间的确存在着一些其他问题，迫切需要我们加以讨论和寻求解决。因此，我建议我们这次会谈的议程如下：
      一、双方平民回国问题；
    二、双方有所争执的其他实际问题。
    我们认为，在讨论第二项议程时，各方都可以提出它认为应予讨论的直接牵涉到中美双方的问题，以便双方自由地交换意见。
    对于我所提出的这一议程，我愿意听取你的意见。”
    在王炳南大使发言后，美国代表约翰逊大使作简短发言。他说，他对王炳南大使所通知的消息“感到满意和感谢”。
    根据中国代表的建议，会谈在议程问题上达成了协议，并于四时 五十分休会到二日上午十时再开。
    新华社日内瓦二日电　中华人民共和国和美利坚合众国两国大使级会谈二日上午在国联大厦举行了第二次会议。
    会议以后发表的一项联合公报如下：
    “中华人民共和国的大使和美利坚合众国的大使于一九五五年八月二日在日内瓦举行了他们的第二次会议。
    他们讨论了议程上的第一个项目（双方平民回国问题）。
    他们同意下一次会议在八月四日上午十时举行。”
