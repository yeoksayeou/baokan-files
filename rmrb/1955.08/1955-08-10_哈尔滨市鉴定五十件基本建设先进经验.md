    Harbin Identifies Fifty Advanced Experiences in Basic Construction

    The nationally renowned Wang Sunchi's sectional parallel assembly line method and Su Changyou's bricklaying method, among other advanced experiences, have seen new developments in the past year. These experiences, after being assessed by the Harbin Municipal Basic Construction Advanced Experience Promotion Committee, have been further enriched. Su Changyou's three-section continuous bricklaying method has been developed into a sectional continuous bricklaying method, making it applicable even in smaller-scale projects. Wang Sunchi's sectional parallel assembly line method has been enriched with the experience of cross-construction combining carpentry formwork support and bricklaying. Using this new construction method, the construction period for each floor can be shortened from the past ten days to seven days.

    The Harbin Municipal Basic Construction Advanced Experience Promotion Committee recently registered, organized, and assessed fifty pieces of advanced experience in basic construction with universal promotional significance, and plans to vigorously promote them in basic construction sites throughout the city in the second half of this year.

    Through this advanced experience assessment work, many similar advanced experiences in Harbin in the past have been integrated and organized. This allows for the selection of the most efficient for promotion by drawing on strengths and compensating for weaknesses. For example, there used to be twelve types of scribing tools for carpenters. Now it has been decided to promote the scribing machine created by carpenter Liu Cunxin. His scribing machine is six times more efficient than manual scribing, while the least efficient scribing machine can only improve efficiency by 30 percent. Others, such as the water and heating worker Shao Hongyu's prefabrication three-dimensional rapid construction method and the water and heating worker Pan Hongjun's parallel assembly line method, were promoted simultaneously in the past. This time, through consolidation, they have been combined into a complete experience of rapid construction for water and heating workers.

    This assessment also particularly focused on summarizing advanced experiences in the construction of industrial buildings such as factories and metal structures. Advanced experiences such as the anti-deformation method of electric welding and the pre-installation of water and heating equipment will be promoted here.

    In order to promote these experiences, the Harbin Municipal Basic Construction Advanced Experience Promotion Committee plans to hold thirteen on-site exchange and observation meetings on advanced experiences in the second half of the year and establish demonstration construction sites for promoting advanced experiences.

### 哈尔滨市鉴定五十件基本建设先进经验

    哈尔滨市鉴定五十件基本建设先进经验
    全国著名的王孙慈分段平行流水作业法、苏长有砌砖法等先进经验，在近一年来都有了新的发展，他们的经验经过哈尔滨市基本建设推广先进经验工作委员会的鉴定都进一步充实了。苏长有的三段连续砌砖法已发展为分段连续砌砖法，这样在规模较小的工程上也可以运用。王孙慈的分段平行流水作业法中充实了木工支模板和瓦工砌砖相结合的交叉施工经验。运用这个新的施工方法施工，每层楼的施工期可从过去的十天缩短到七天。
    哈尔滨市基本建设推广先进经验工作委员会最近登记、整理和鉴定出五十件基本建设方面的有普遍推广意义的先进经验，准备今年下半年在全市基本建设工地上大力推广。
    通过这次先进经验的鉴定工作，哈尔滨市过去许多相同的先进经验，都得到综合和整理，这样就可以取长补短，选出效率最高的进行推广。如木工的划线工具过去有十二种，现在决定推广木工刘存心创造的划线机。他的划线机比手工划线能提高效率六倍，而效率最低的划线机只能提高效率百分之三十。其他如水暖工邵洪玉创造的水暖预制立体快速施工法和水暖工潘洪钧创造的平行流水作业法，过去都是同时推广的。这次通过整理也结合成为一个完整的水暖工快速施工的经验。
    这次鉴定中还特别着重总结了建设厂房、金属结构等工业建筑的先进经验。在这里准备推广的有电焊反变形法和水暖设备预安装等先进经验。
    为了推广这些经验，哈尔滨市基本建设推广先进经验工作委员会准备在下半年举行十三次先进经验的实地交流观摩会和建立推广先进经验的示范工地。（新华社）
