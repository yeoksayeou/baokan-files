　　Soviet Mixed Football Team Defeats West German World Champion Team Three to Two
    On the 21st, the Soviet mixed football team defeated the 1954 World Football Champion – the mixed football team of the Federal Republic of Germany – with a score of three to two.
    This exciting match held at the "Dynamo" stadium in Moscow aroused widespread interest. Seventy thousand spectators attended the game. Among them were 1,500 Germans who came specifically to watch the game, as well as travelers from many other countries. Diplomats from various countries sat in the boxes. There were also a particularly large number of reporters from various newspapers and radio stations covering the game. Dozens of television cameras, still cameras, and movie cameras were active around the stadium.
    Due to heavy rain, the field was wet when the game started. But the match immediately unfolded with intense scenes. Soviet players launched rapid attacks, especially from both wings. West German players responded calmly with clean and efficient movements. In the fourteenth minute of the game, the Soviet players' attack, due to clever coordination, slipped past the goalkeeper and scored a goal. Subsequently, the Soviet team could have scored again, but it was prevented by the efforts of the German defenders. Then, highly tense moments appeared in front of both goals. In the twenty-seventh minute of the game, the West German captain scored a goal. The score of one to one continued until the end of the first half.
    After the break, at the fifty-second minute, loud applause erupted from the stands, because the West German players kicked a low and hard ball from the side. The score became two to one, with the West German team taking the lead. However, the Soviet team then launched a long period of attack, scoring two goals in the four minutes after the sixty-ninth minute of the game. The Soviet team then maintained the initiative, and their offensive momentum continued until the end.
    After the game, the referee (British) told reporters that the game was very interesting. The score fully matched the characteristics of the game. The Soviet footballers played stronger and better.

　　苏联混合足球队三比二胜西德世界冠军队
    苏联的混合足球队在二十一日以三比二击败了一九五四年的世界足球冠军——德意志联邦共和国的混合足球队。
    这次在莫斯科“狄那莫”运动场举行的精彩比赛引起了广泛的兴趣。到场看比赛的观众有七万人。观众中有专门来看球赛的一千五百个德国人和其他许多国家的旅行者。在包厢里坐着各国的外交使节。来采访球赛的各报社和广播电台的记者也特别多。球场旁有几十架电视摄像机、照像机和电影摄影机在活动。
    由于下了大雨，球赛开始时球场上是湿的。但比赛一开始就展开了激烈的场面。苏联队员特别从两翼发动了迅速的进攻。西德队员以干净利落的动作沉着应战。比赛到十四分钟时，苏联队员的进攻由于配合得巧妙，闪过了守门员，而射进了一球。随后，苏联队本来还可以得分，但是由于德国队后卫的努力，没有得手。接着双方球门口都出现了十分紧张的场面，比赛到二十七分钟时，西德队队长踢进了一球。一对一的比分一直延续到前半场结束。
    休息过后，在五十二分钟的时候，看台上传出了响亮的掌声，原来西德队员从旁边踢进了一个又低又硬的球。比分变成二比一，西德队占先。但是，苏联队接着展开了长时间的进攻，在比赛到六十九分钟后的四分钟内连进了两球。苏联队后来一直掌握了主动，他们的攻势一直保持到结束。
    比赛结束后，裁判（英国人）对记者说，这场比赛十分有趣。比分完全和比赛的特点相符。苏联足球员打得比较强，比较好。
