    A Construction Unit That Continues to Waste
    Sun Jiabin
    The dormitory and canteen projects built by the State-owned Eighth Rubber Factory (hereinafter referred to as Party A) were originally designed with very high costs. The dormitory cost 97 yuan per square meter, and the canteen cost 105 yuan per square meter. After Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on "Practicing Strict Economy and Striving to Complete Socialist Construction" was published, the construction workers of the First Construction Team of the Changchun Second Construction Company (hereinafter referred to as Party B), which was constructing for the factory, put forward many rationalization proposals to reduce items and lower the cost of buildings. As of July 8, the cost of the dormitory project had been reduced by 5.92%, reducing the cost per square meter of the dormitory to just over 92 yuan.
    This indicator is far from meeting the requirements of the state and needs to be further reduced. However, when Party B continued to propose ways to save money, Party A disagreed. For example, Party B suggested promoting the advanced Soviet experience of "hollow walls" on the third floor of the dormitory project, which would reduce the weight of the walls, making them safer and of better quality, saving more than 600 yuan. But Party A refused to promote it. The site director of Party B suggested building four fire walls instead of heating in the canteen, which would save more than 13,000 yuan and be both economical and practical. However, Party A's site representative did not agree with this opinion and emphasized that "the materials have been prepared, and it is impossible to deal with them if they are not built." Party B proposed canceling the decorative parts under the eaves of the house. After repeated discussions, Party A insisted on retaining some of them, resulting in a waste of 64 yuan for nothing. For the sake of "beauty," Wang, the deputy section chief of the Capital Construction Section of Party A, also advocated painting the outer skin of the building red. The site director of Party B initially disagreed, saying, "This is a waste and will be criticized." Deputy Section Chief Wang said: "I am not afraid of being criticized, I am responsible for making mistakes." As a result, the site director of Party B did not adhere to the principle of economy and still painted it.
    In fact, building such high-standard dormitories not only wastes state funds but also deviates from the actual living standards of employees. The dormitories newly built by the factory last year were also of a very high standard. Wang Xuezeng, a worker in the Third Workshop, earns 245 yuan a month. A family of four lives in a house of about 16 square meters. Including water, electricity, and heating costs, the expenditure in December last year was 22 yuan and 91 cents. Because the rent is expensive, many people want to move. However, the leading staff of the factory did not consider these practical difficulties of the employees at all and continued to build such high-standard dormitories this year.

    一个继续浪费的建设单位
    孙加斌
    国营第八橡胶厂（以下简称甲方）修建的宿舍和食堂工程，原设计的造价很高。宿舍每平方公尺九十七元；食堂每平方公尺一百零五元。李富春副总理关于“厉行节约，为完成社会主义建设而奋斗”的报告发表以后，为该厂施工的长春市第二工程公司第一施工队（以下简称乙方）的建筑工人们，提了很多削减项目、降低建筑物造价的合理化建议，截至七月八日止，已使宿舍工程造价降低了百分之五点九二，使宿舍每平方公尺造价降低到九十二元多。
    这指标还远远达不到国家的要求，需要进一步降低造价。可是，当乙方继续提出节约办法时，甲方却不同意。例如乙方曾建议在宿舍工程三楼推广苏联的“空心墙”先进经验，这样可减轻墙的重量，既安全，质量又好，可以节约六百多元。但甲方拒绝推广。乙方工地主任建议在食堂修四个火墙代替暖气，可节省一万三千多元，又经济又适用。但甲方工地代表不赞同这个意见，并强调“料已备齐了，不修没法处理”。乙方提出取消房檐下的装饰部分，经过再三商量，甲方仍坚持要保留一部分，结果白白浪费了六十四元。为了“美观”，甲方基建科王副科长还主张把楼的外皮刷一层红色。乙方工地主任起先不同意，说“这样作是浪费，要受批评。”王副科长说：“受批评我不怕，犯错误我负责。”结果乙方工地主任也没坚持节约原则仍然刷了。
    事实上，修筑这种标准比较高的宿舍，既浪费国家的资金，又脱离了职工的现实生活水平。该厂去年新修的宿舍，标准也很高。三车间工人王学增每月工资二百四十五分，一家四口人住了十六平方公尺左右的房子，加上水、电和暖气等费用，去年十二月份一个月支出二十二元九角一分。因为房租贵，不少人要搬家。但该厂的领导工作人员丝毫没有考虑职工这些实际困难，今年又继续修建了标准这样高的宿舍。（原载吉林日报，本报略加删改）
