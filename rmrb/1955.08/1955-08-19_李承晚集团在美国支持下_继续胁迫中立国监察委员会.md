Xinhua News Agency, August 18th - South Korean Ambassador to the United States, Liang Youtan, reiterated on the 17th during a meeting with a United Press reporter that the United States actively supports the Syngman Rhee group's attitude of opposing the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

Liang Youtan recounted to the United Press reporter his recent talks with senior officials of the US State Department regarding the Korean crisis. He said that US Assistant Secretary of State Robertson "warmly agreed with our attitude towards Korea. He said that the United States is as interested as we are in driving out the Communists." Robertson also told Liang Youtan that the United States would "soon find a solution." Liang Youtan explained that the "solution" Robertson referred to was "the final disbandment of the commission."

It is precisely because the United States has adopted this attitude that the Syngman Rhee's group's atrocities of coercing the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to withdraw have not stopped. Since the 17th, rioters in Incheon have repeatedly attempted to break into the Neutral Nations Inspection Team's residence on Wolmido Island. They violently threw stones and blocked the causeway with trucks. Violence and demonstrations against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission continue to occur in Seoul and other ports.

    李承晚集团在美国支持下
    继续胁迫中立国监察委员会
    新华社十八日讯　南朝鲜驻美国大使梁佑灿十七日在接见合众社记者时再次说明，美国积极支持李承晚集团反对中立国监察委员会的态度。
    梁佑灿向合众社记者追述了他最近就朝鲜危机和美国国务院高级官员举行的会谈。他说，美国助理国务卿罗伯逊“热烈赞同我们朝鲜的态度。他说，美国对赶走共产党人是和我们同样感到兴趣的”。罗伯逊还对梁佑灿说，美国将“很快找出一个解决办法”。梁佑灿说明罗伯逊所指的“解决办法是最后解散这个委员会”。
    正是由于美国采取了这种态度，南朝鲜胁迫中立国监察委员会撤退的暴行一直没有停止。十七日以来，仁川的暴徒一再企图攻入中立国视察小组驻地月尾岛。他们狂暴地投掷石头，并且用卡车封锁堤道。在汉城和其他口岸也在继续发生反对中立国监察委员会的暴行和示威。
