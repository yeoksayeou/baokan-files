Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 22nd: Delhi newspapers report that, according to sources from the Goa Congress Party, since the movement of Indian volunteers entering Goa to support the liberation of Goa began three months ago, a total of 3,646 Indian volunteers have entered Goa. Apart from the volunteers who were killed, 188 volunteers suffered injuries requiring hospitalization for more than a week for treatment. Among them, 25 sustained gunshot wounds. Those arrested were subjected to abuse by the Portuguese in prison. Almost all others suffered injuries from beatings with sticks and rubber batons.

On the evening of August 20th, the latest group of 40 Indian volunteers to enter Portuguese-occupied territory at Dodamarg on the Goa border were also beaten and driven out of Goa by Portuguese police on the morning of August 21st. Another group of 82 volunteers, led by Mr. M. Dandavate, Joint Secretary of the People's Socialist Party, who entered Goa on the evening of August 19th, were also expelled from Goa the following morning. They were all beaten with sticks by the Portuguese.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 22nd: Public opinion in many countries has expressed support and sympathy for the Indian people's movement to recover Goa.

Cairo's "Al-Akhbar" in Egypt wrote in its August 19th editorial:
	“It is certain that India will reclaim Goa and incorporate this part of India into India. It is equally certain that Portuguese imperialism has disappeared from the world and will continue to disappear.” The newspaper believes that Portugal's attempt to continue to occupy Goa is short-sighted, and that Portuguese soldiers firing on unarmed Indian volunteers walking on their own country's land is a violation of the spirit of humanitarianism.

The Canadian "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" wrote in its August 16th editorial that after the end of the Second World War, the fervor for independence swept the world. In modern history, it is impossible to find a reason for Portugal to continue to occupy Goa, Daman, and Diu. The newspaper said: "Portugal will eventually be forced to recognize reality. Why not withdraw before further bloodshed and hatred occur?"

Argentina's "La Democracia" also published a commentary on August 19th, expressing support for India's position that Portugal cannot use the fact that it has usurped Goa for 400 years as a reason for occupying the area.

A report from the Goa correspondent of the British "Observer" pointed out that the people of all walks of life in Goa have shown very clearly that they want to return to India. The reporter wrote: "I could not find a Hindu farmer willing to speak well of Portugal. On the other hand, I found that middle-class people, whether Hindu or Catholic, are also inclined towards India."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 22nd: The Vietnamese "Nhan Dan" published a commentary on August 21st entitled "Goa Must Be Liberated."

The commentary said that the Indian people's struggle to liberate Goa is part of the struggle of the awakened Asian people to end the colonial system. This just struggle of the Indian people has won the sympathy and support of the Asian people and the people of the world.

The commentary said that the Asian people and the people of the world are filled with incomparable anger at the barbaric acts of the Portuguese colonialists. The heroic and indomitable fighting spirit of the patriotic Indian people who went to Goa has been admired by everyone. Any brutal means of the Portuguese colonialists cannot stop the Indian people from liberating Goa.

The commentary concluded by saying that the Vietnamese people warmly support the Indian people's struggle to liberate Goa and firmly believe that the Indian people will surely achieve victory.

　　印度志愿人员三个月来有三千多名进入果阿
　　各国舆论支持和同情印度解放果阿的运动
    新华社新德里二十二日电　德里报纸报道，据果阿国大党的消息，自从三个月前开始了印度志愿人员进入果阿支援解放果阿的运动以来，已经一共有三千六百四十六名印度志愿人员进入过果阿。除了被杀害的志愿人员以外，有一百八十八名志愿人员受的伤需要住院一星期以上来进行治疗。其中有二十五人受到枪伤。被逮捕的人在监狱中受到了葡萄牙人的虐待。差不多所有其他的人都因为受到棍子和橡皮棒殴打而造成伤害。
    八月二十日晚，在果阿边境多达迈进入葡萄牙占领的土地的最近一批四十名印度志愿人员，又被打伤，他们在二十一日早晨被葡萄牙警察赶出果阿。由人民社会党联合书记麦·丹达瓦特率领的在八月十九日晚进入果阿的另一批八十二个志愿人员，也在第二天早晨被逐出果阿。他们都受到葡萄牙人棍棒殴打。
    新华社新德里二十二日电　许多国家的舆论对印度人民收复果阿的运动表示支持和同情。
    埃及开罗“消息报”在十九日的社论中写道：
  “确定无疑地，印度将会收回果阿，把这个属于印度一部分的地方并入印度。同样是确定无疑地：葡萄牙帝国主义已经在世界上消逝，并且将继续消逝。”报纸认为，葡萄牙企图继续占有果阿是短视的，而葡萄牙兵士开枪射击没有武装的、在他们自己国家的土地上行走的印度志愿人员是违反人道主义精神的。
    加拿大“圣路易邮报”在十六日的社论中写道，在第二次世界大战结束以后，要求独立的热潮席卷了全世界。在现代的历史中，不可能找到葡萄牙继续占有果阿和达曼、第乌的理由。这家报纸说：“葡萄牙最后终将被迫承认现实。为什么不在发生进一步的流血和仇恨之前就退出呢？”
    阿根廷“民主报”也在十九日发表评论，表示支持印度的态度，即葡萄牙不能以僭夺果阿四百年这点作为它占有这块地方的理由。
    英国“观察家报”记者从果阿发回的消息指出，果阿各界人民十分明确地显示他们是要重归印度的。这个记者写道：“我不可能找到一个信奉印度教的农民愿意给葡萄牙讲好话。另一面，我发现中等阶层的人，无论是印度教徒或天主教徒，也都是倾向印度的。”
    新华社河内二十二日电　越南“人民报”在二十一日发表了题为“果阿必须得到解放”的评论。
    评论说，印度人民解放果阿的斗争是已经觉醒的亚洲人民结束殖民制度斗争中的一个部分。印度人民这个正义的斗争得到亚洲和世界人民的同情和支持。
    评论说，亚洲人民和世界人民对葡萄牙殖民主义者的野蛮行为感到无比的愤怒。前往果阿的印度爱国人民的英勇不屈的斗争精神已经得到大家的钦佩。葡萄牙殖民主义者的任何残暴手段都不能阻挠印度人民解放果阿。
    评论最后说，越南人民热烈支持印度人民解放果阿的斗争，并且深信印度人民将一定获得胜利。
