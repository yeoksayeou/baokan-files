    Joy and Gratitude
    Ren Hui

    It is already late autumn, and the wind is blowing, but when I think of the great festival of the October Revolution, our hearts feel infinite warmth. Living in the new era opened up by the October Revolution is our happiness, and being able to have the Soviet Union as a friend is our pride.
    The friendship between China and the Soviet Union is an extraordinary "righteous friendship." The "dao" referred to here is the great road of Marxism-Leninism, and the "yi" referred to here is the great righteousness of proletarian internationalism. Because the people of our two countries have always been unwavering and steadfast in their loyalty to this kind of righteousness, the friendship between our two countries has been able to withstand various tests and increasingly demonstrate its strength and brilliance.
    Our generation has come from the abyss of sorrow and suffering to the road of happiness and joy. Never forgetting danger while in peace, it is not easy for us to forget the long days of suffering in the past. As the old saying goes, adversity reveals friends, and time reveals people's hearts. The Chinese people will always, forever, regard the Soviet Union as the most reliable and loyal friend, only because since the founding of the Soviet Union, for forty-one years, whenever the Chinese people have encountered the most difficult and dangerous times, it has stepped forward, regardless of gains or losses, regardless of success or failure, and extended a helping hand. There are many words in the Chinese language to describe friendship, such as old rain and spring breeze, friendship between generations, the steadfastness of gold and stone, the firmness of glue and lacquer, etc. It seems that in the face of the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, these old words have long paled in comparison and are far from enough to express its depth and breadth.
    The Chinese people admire the way of friendship most, so whether in history, novels or operas, our writers always regard those who act bravely for a just cause, help those in need, come to the rescue when injustice is seen, and draw their swords to help as heroes worthy of emulation, and always regard those who are faithless, see profit and forget righteousness, break alliances and sell friends as typical of evil virtues. So, let us look at the history of these forty-one years. After the success of the October Revolution, the Soviet Union was the first country to abolish unequal treaties with China; during our Northern Expedition, the Soviet Union was the only country to aid China's revolutionary war; near the end of the Second World War, the Soviet Union was the first to send troops to help us liberate the Northeast; after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union was the first to recognize our country and signed a treaty of alliance and mutual assistance with our country; when American imperialism created tension in the Taiwan Strait, the Soviet Union resolutely stated that "an invasion of China is equal to an invasion of the Soviet Union." But, on the other hand, after the First World War, it was the United States that colluded with Britain and Japan at the Paris Peace Conference to conspire to divide China; during the Northern Expedition, it was the United States that helped the warlords undermine the Chinese revolution; during the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was the United States that subsidized Japan with munitions and scrap iron; at the end of the Second World War, it was the United States that aided Chiang Kai-shek and supported Japan, creating and launching the Chinese civil war; after the founding of the People's Republic of China, it was the United States that imposed blockades and embargoes, conspired to subvert, launched the Korean War of aggression and occupied Taiwan; ...The above are only the major points. When the Chinese people were in a difficult and dangerous situation, who helped us, who stepped on us, who is a friend, who is an enemy, isn't it very clear?
    It has only been forty-one years since the October Revolution, not even half a century, but today's balance of power has shown that the East wind has prevailed over the West wind, and the life of the imperialists will not be too long. We are joyful, we are grateful, may the great Soviet Union be more prosperous and stronger, may our friendship with the Soviet Union be more consolidated and more developed, and may the light of the great October Socialist Revolution shine farther and brighter!

    欢乐与感激
    任晦
    已经是深秋了，刮着风，但是一想起十月革命节这个伟大的节日，我们的心就感到了无限温暖。生活在十月革命开辟的新的时代，是我们的幸福，能够有苏联这样一个朋友，是我们的骄傲。
    中国和苏联的友谊，是一种不平凡的“道义之交”。这里所说的道，是马克思列宁主义的大道，这里所说的义，是无产阶级国际主义的大义。由于我们两国人民始终不渝、坚如金石地忠实于这种道义，所以我们两国之间的友谊才能够经历各种考验，而愈益显示出她的力量和光辉。
    我们这一辈人，都是从忧患苦难的深渊走向到幸福欢乐的道路上来的。安不忘危，我们就很不容易忘记过去那一段漫长的患难的日子。古话说，患难识朋友，日久见人心。中国人民永远永远地将苏联当作一个最可靠最忠实的朋友，只因为自从苏联建国以来，四十一年，每当中国人民遭遇到最困难、最危险的时候，他就挺身而出、不计利害、不计成败地伸出了援助之手。中国语文中有许多形容友谊的话，如旧雨春风，忘年知己，金石之坚，胶漆之固等等，看来，在中苏两国人民的友谊前面，这些旧的词汇早已经黯然无色，远不足以表达它的深度和宽度了。
    中国人是最崇尚友道的，所以不论在历史、小说或者戏曲中，我们的作家总是把见义勇为、扶危济困、路见不平、拔刀相助的人物当作值得效法的英雄，也总是把背信弃义、见利忘义、破盟卖友的徒辈当作恶德的典型。那么，让我们来看看这四十一年间的历史吧。十月革命成功之后，苏联是第一个废除对中国的不平等条约的国家；在我国北伐战争的时候，苏联是唯一援助中国革命战争的国家；在第二次世界大战快结束的时候，苏联是第一个出兵帮助我们解放东北的国家；在中华人民共和国成立以后，苏联是第一个承认我国、并和我国订立了同盟互助条约的国家；在美帝国主义制造台湾海峡紧张局势的时候，苏联是坚决地表示了“侵犯中国就等于侵犯苏联”的国家。可是，另一面呢，在第一次世界大战之后，在巴黎和会上勾结英日，密谋瓜分中国的是美国；在北伐战争的时候，帮助军阀破坏中国革命的是美国；在抗日战争的时候，把军火和废铁资助日本的是美国；在第二次世界大战结束的时候，助蒋扶日，制造和发动中国内战的是美国；在中华人民共和国成立之后，封锁禁运、阴谋颠覆、发动侵朝战争和霸占台湾的是美国；……以上所举，只不过荦荦大者而已，当中国人民处境艰危的时候，谁帮了我们一手，谁踩了我们一脚，谁是朋友，谁是敌人，这不是非常明白的么？
    十月革命以来才不过四十一年，还不足半个世纪，可是，今天的力量对比已经表明，东风压倒了西风，帝国主义者的寿命已经不会太长久了。我们欢乐，我们感激，愿伟大的苏联更加繁荣、更加强大，愿我们和苏联的友谊更加巩固、更加发展，愿伟大的十月社会主义革命的光芒照得更远、照得更亮！
