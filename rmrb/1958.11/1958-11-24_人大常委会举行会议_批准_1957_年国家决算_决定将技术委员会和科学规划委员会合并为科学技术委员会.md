Xinhua News Agency, 23rd — The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress held its 102nd meeting this afternoon. Based on the "Resolution on the Implementation of the 1957 National Budget and the 1958 National Budget" of the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress, the meeting approved the 1957 national budget presented by the State Council.

The 1957 national budget showed a total income of 31.01 billion yuan, which was 105.5% of the budget, exceeding the budget by 1.62 billion yuan. The total expenditure for the year was 30.42 billion yuan, which was 103.5% of the budget, exceeding the budget by 1.03 billion yuan. The surplus at the end of the year, after offsetting income and expenditure, was 590 million yuan. There are some discrepancies between the finalized income and expenditure figures and the estimated income and expenditure figures for 1957, which were reported to the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress in February of this year. The finalized income figure increased by 310 million yuan compared to the estimated income figure of 30.7 billion yuan. The finalized expenditure figure decreased by 130 million yuan compared to the estimated expenditure figure of 30.55 billion yuan. Therefore, the year-end surplus increased by 440 million yuan compared to the estimated figure of 150 million yuan.

The reason for some discrepancies between the finalized and estimated income and expenditure figures is mainly because the thorough development of the rectification campaign and the further implementation of the increase production and practice economy campaign led to an increase in the total industrial output value compared to the original estimated completion figure, resulting in an increase in fiscal revenue compared to the original estimated figure. At the same time, various central departments and regions conducted necessary control over year-end expenditures while ensuring investment needs, resulting in lower finalized expenditures than estimated expenditures.

Based on the proposal submitted by the State Council, the meeting decided to merge the State Technology Commission and the State Council Science Planning Commission into the Science and Technology Commission.

The meeting also approved a list of appointments and removals.

Xinhua News Agency, 21st — The State Council held its 82nd plenary meeting today. The meeting approved the "1957 National Budget of the People's Republic of China" and submitted it to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for review and approval.

The meeting approved the merger of the State Technology Commission and the State Council Science Planning Commission into the Science and Technology Commission and submitted it to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation and decision.

The plenary meeting approved the "Regulations of the State Council on Procedures for Concluding Treaties," approved in principle the "Decision of the State Council on Establishing a Maritime Arbitration Commission within the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade," and heard the "Report on the Third Plenary Meeting of the Western Pacific Fisheries Research Commission" by Xu Deheng, Minister of Aquatic Products. The meeting also approved decisions on changes to the administrative divisions of counties and cities under the jurisdiction of Shanxi, Jilin, Shaanxi, Gansu, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Inner Mongolia, and Shanghai. Finally, the meeting approved matters relating to appointments and removals.

    人大常委会举行会议
    批准1957年国家决算
    决定将技术委员会和科学规划委员会合并为科学技术委员会
    新华社23日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会今天下午举行第一百零二次会议。会议根据第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议关于1957年国家预算执行情况和1958年国家预算的决议，批准了国务院提出的1957年国家决算。
    1957年国家决算中，本年收入合计三百一十点一亿元，为预算的105.5％，超过预算十六点二亿元；本年支出合计三百零四点二亿元，为预算的103.5％，超过预算十点三亿元；收支相抵年终结余五点九亿元。收支决算数字同今年2月间向第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议报告的1957年预计收支数字比较，是有一些出入的。收入决算数比收入预计数三百零七亿元增加了三点一亿元；支出决算数比支出预计数三百零五点五亿元减少了一点三亿元，因此，年终结余就比预计数一点五亿元增多了四点四亿元。
    收支决算数同预计数有一些出入的原因，主要是由于整风运动的深入开展，增产节约的进一步贯彻，使工业总产值较原来预计完成数有所增加，因而使财政收入比原来预计数亦有增加；同时中央各部门及各地区在保证投资需要的情况下，对年终开支进行了必要的控制，因而决算支出数较预计支出数亦少支了一些。
    会议根据国务院提出的议案，决定将国家技术委员会和国务院科学规划委员会合并为科学技术委员会。
    会议还通过了任免名单。
    新华社21日讯　国务院今日举行第八十二次全体会议。会议通过了中华人民共和国1957年国家决算，并提请全国人民代表大会常务委员会审查批准。
    会议通过将国家技术委员会和国务院科学规划委员会合并为科学技术委员会，并提请全国人民代表大会常务委员会审议决定。
    全体会议通过了“国务院关于缔结条约程序的规定”，原则通过“国务院关于在中国国际贸易促进委员会内设立海事仲裁委员会的决定”，听取了水产部部长许德珩“关于太平洋西部渔业研究委员会第三次全体会议的报告”。会议还通过了关于山西、吉林、陕西、甘肃、江苏、浙江、内蒙古、上海等省、自治区、直辖市所辖县、市行政区划变更的决定。会议最后通过了任免事项。
