    The Search for Mineral Deposits
    In our country, prospecting has become a national undertaking and has been equipped with modern technology. We are using various methods to find underground treasures. What methods are there?
    
    Investigating Geology, Following Clues
    The most basic method is to conduct geological surveys. That is, to clarify the distribution of various rocks on the ground, their formation age, and the positional relationship between the rocks, and use different color symbols to represent them on topographic maps to create geological maps.
    
    Clarifying these situations is very useful for prospecting. "Tigers hide in deep mountains, birds fly to the forest." There are also rules to follow for what kind of rock hides what kind of ore. Because minerals are formed simultaneously in the process of forming rocks, different rocks and minerals are generated under different natural geographic environments, times, and conditions, each with its own characteristics. Therefore, finding a certain type of rock may lead to finding related minerals. For example, non-ferrous metal mines can often be found near igneous rock masses, which are formed after the cooling of high-heat magma. Coal cannot be found here; coal must be found in sedimentary rocks formed in lakes and swamps. It can be seen that after clarifying the geological conditions and creating a geological map, there will be more clues to finding minerals.
    
    Aerial Photography, Seeing a Thousand Miles at a Glance
    To clarify the geological conditions, one has to cross mountains and ridges to observe and record, which takes a lot of time, especially in areas with inconvenient transportation. Now we use airplanes to take aerial photographs, and the ground conditions of vast areas can be captured in a very short time. Different types of rocks have different terrains, color depths, etc., leaving uneven traces on the ground. For example, shale areas are always depressed, while sandstone often protrudes. Different colors of rocks will leave different shades of marks on the photos, and so on. In this way, we can see their distribution from the photos. What if the rocks are covered by plants? Sometimes, the growth of plants is also different in different rock areas, which can help us identify the boundaries of rock distribution. In addition to aerial photography, people can also sit on airplanes to observe directly. This aerial geological surveying method saves a lot of manpower, material resources, and time than walking surveys, although it cannot completely replace ground work, it has become an increasingly important prospecting method.
    
    Searching Along Rivers, Tracing Footprints
    Minerals buried underground often reveal a little bit on the surface, which is called ore outcrop. Seeing it, we know that there is a mineral here. But often the outcrop area is small and not easy to find. However, there are still traces to follow. Some outcrops are exposed to sunlight and rain, and many minerals are dissolved away, forming many cavities and often have various colors, which look very special and can be recognized. Some outcrops are softer or harder than the surrounding rocks, making the terrain concave or convex, which is also a sign. But it is not easy to find them by these alone. However, due to weathering, part of the outcrop breaks down into ore and mineral sand, which are washed away by running water and scattered widely, making them easier to find. We can often find ore and mineral sand in rivers and ditches, and then we can search upstream, following the traces of ore and mineral sand to find their nests. Near the ore body, the debris of ore will become more and more numerous and larger, becoming a signal reminding us to pay attention to finding the ore body.
    
    Underground Hunting, Leaving No Stone Unturned
    We can see ore and mineral sand with the naked eye, which are relatively easy to find. What if we can't see anything at all? There are still ways. In fact, there are many small substances dispersed from the ore body around the ore body that are invisible to the naked eye, and the closer to the ore body, the more there are. For example, the soil, groundwater, and plants near copper mines all contain trace amounts of copper. China produces a kind of copper grass, with flowers like toothbrushes and purplish-red in color, which specifically grows in copper mining areas and becomes a marker for finding copper. However, many times plants absorb certain metals, but it cannot be seen from the outside. At this time, modern physical and chemical analysis methods come to help. Even if the metal content is only one ten-thousandth or even one millionth, it can be found. Therefore, we can find the area with the highest content based on the analysis results of soil, plants, spring water, river water, etc. in various places within a region. Underground treasures are often hidden here, just like hunting, surrounding the mineral and finally hunting it down.
    
    Geophysical Exploration, Above and Below Ground
    By using the changes in the geophysical properties of the earth, minerals can be found even when no trace of the ore body is seen. Because the rocks in the earth's crust have a certain mass, which is reflected in a certain gravity. Rocks also have certain magnetism, conductivity, and elasticity. When there is a mineral deposit underground, because the characteristics of the ore are different from ordinary rocks, it will show abnormal phenomena. By using instruments to measure these abnormal phenomena, we can know that there may be minerals under those places where the abnormalities are very strong. Recently, we have also begun to use the rays emitted by radioactive elements to find minerals, using instruments to record the strength of the rays from the ground. There are often a large number of radioactive minerals in places where it is strong. Different rocks often also have different contents of radioactive elements, emitting rays of different intensities, so this characteristic can also be used to clarify the underground situation.
    
    Quarrying and Opening Mountains, Peeling off the Topsoil
    Although the above methods are good, after all, we have not yet seen the underground situation, especially in areas covered by floating soil with no outcrops. Therefore, we also have to peel off the topsoil to take a look, generally using methods such as digging trenches, digging wells, excavating tunnels, and drilling holes. In this way, whether there are minerals or not? How much mineral deposits are there? There can be definite answers.
    
    Everyone Can Find, Not Mysterious
    With the continuous development of science and technology, there will definitely be more and more methods for prospecting. These methods are not mysterious to use. Currently, many farmers have mastered the technology of using radioactivity to find minerals after short-term training. This shows that everyone can find minerals, and when these modern methods are popularized, there will definitely be a greater underground harvest.

    矿藏的探寻
    在我国，找矿已成为全民的事业，而且得到了近代化的装备，我们正用着各种方法找寻地下宝藏。有哪些方法呢？
    查明地质  按图索骥
    最基本的方法是进行地质测量。也就是说，要弄清地面各种岩石的分布、形成时代以及岩石相互间在位置上的关系，用不同的颜色符号将它们表示在地形图上，制成地质图。
    弄清这些情况对找矿用处很大。“虎藏深山鸟投林”，什么石头藏什么矿也有规律可寻。因为矿产是在形成石头的过程中同时形成的，在不同的自然地理环境、时间和条件下，生成了不同的石头和矿产，各有自己的特点，因而找到了某种石头也就有可能找到相关的矿产。譬如在火成岩体的附近，常可找到有色金属矿，它们都是高热的岩浆冷却后生成的。在这里找不到煤，煤要到湖沼中形成的沉积岩里去找。由此可见，查明了地质情况，作出地质图，找起矿来线索就多了。
    飞机照相  一目千里
    要弄清地质情况就得翻山越岭，观察记录，费的时间不少，特别在交通不便的地区更是缓慢。现在我们利用飞机在空中摄影，广大区域的地面情况可以在极短的时间内被摄制下来。不同种类的岩石所造成的地形、颜色深浅等都有不同，在地面上留下了凸凹不平的痕迹，比如，页岩区总是下凹的，而沙岩则常常凸起，岩石的颜色不同，会在照片上留下深浅不同的标记，等等。这样，我们就可以从照片上看出它们的分布情况。要是岩石被植物复盖了怎么办？有时在不同的岩石区域里，植物的生长情况也不同，可以帮助我们认出岩石分布的界线。除飞机照相以外，人也可以同时坐在飞机上直接观察。这种航空地质测量法比步行调查要省很多人力、物力和时间，虽然还不能完全代替地面的工作，但已成为日益重要的一种找矿方法了。
    沿河搜索  追寻踪迹
    矿在地下埋藏常常会露出一星半点在地面，这叫矿的露头，看见了它我们就知道这里有矿了。但很多时候露头面积小，不易发现。不过，还是有踪迹可寻的。有些露头因为日晒雨淋，许多矿物质被溶走，形成很多空洞，并常有各种颜色，看起来很特殊，可以认出来。有些露头因比周围的岩石软或硬，使地形下凹或上凸，也是一个标志。但光凭这些还不好找，可是，因为风化，露头的一部分崩碎变成矿石矿砂被流水冲走，散布很广，这就比较容易找到了。我们在河沟里常能找到矿石矿砂，这时便可逆流而寻，沿着矿石矿砂的踪迹找到它们的老巢。在靠近矿体的地方，矿石的碎屑会愈来愈多愈大，成为提醒我们注意找寻矿体的信号。
    地下围猎  点滴无遗
    矿石矿砂我们都能用肉眼看见，还比较好找，要是一点也看不见呢？还是有办法的。事实上，在矿体周围还有许多从矿体中分散出来的、肉眼看不见的细小物质存在，愈靠近矿体愈多。譬如在铜矿附近的土壤、地下水、植物中都含有微量的铜，我国出产一种铜草，花像牙刷，颜色紫红，就专门生长在铜矿区，成为找铜的标记。不过，很多时候植物中吸收了某种金属，但从外表上看不出来。这时近代的物理化学分析方法来帮了忙。即使金属的含量只有万分之一，乃至百万分之一都可以找出来。因此我们可以根据在一个地区内各处土壤、植物、泉水、河水等的分析结果，找出那块含量最高的地方。在这里的地下往往隐匿着矿藏，就像围猎一样，将矿包围起来终于把它猎获。
    物理探矿  上天入地
    利用地球物理性质的变化，在一点点矿体的痕迹也未看到的时候，也可以找出矿来。因为地壳中的岩石具有一定的质量，表现为一定的重力，岩石也有一定的磁性、导电性和弹性，当地下某处有了矿藏时，由于矿石的这些性格和普通的石头不一样，便会表现出反常的现象，用仪器测出这些反常现象，便可知道那些反常很厉害的地方下面可能有矿。最近我们还开始利用放射性元素放出的射线来找矿，用仪器记下来自地下的射线的强弱，在那强烈的地方便常常有大量放射性矿物。不同的岩石里往往也有不同含量的放射性元素，放出强度不同的射线，因此也可以根据这个特点去弄清地下的情况。
    凿石开山  剥开地皮
    前面那些方法虽好，但终究我们还未看见地下的情况，特别是那些浮土掩盖没有露头的地区。因此我们还要剥开地皮来看看，一般采用挖槽、掘井、开凿坑道以及钻孔等方法。这样，究竟有矿没矿？矿藏多少？就都可以有肯定的答复了。
    人人能找  并不神秘
    随着科学技术的不断发展，找矿的方法一定愈来愈多。这些方法用起来并不神秘，目前已有不少农民在经过短期训练以后，便掌握了利用放射性来找矿的技术。这说明矿产人人可找，而当这些近代化的方法普及以后，一定会出现更大的地下丰收。
