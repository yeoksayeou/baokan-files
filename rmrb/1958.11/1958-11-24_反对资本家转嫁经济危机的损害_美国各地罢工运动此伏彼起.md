    Opposing Capitalists Shifting the Damage of the Economic Crisis
    Strikes Erupt One After Another Across the United States
    (Comprehensive Report) To oppose capitalists from shifting the losses they suffer in the economic crisis onto the workers, workers in various parts of the United States have recently been holding strikes continuously, demanding higher wages and other benefits.
    Seven thousand mechanics at Trans World Airlines in the United States went on strike on the 21st, demanding wage increases. The strike was held after negotiations between the union and company authorities on the issue of increasing the wages of the mechanics reached a deadlock. This strike forced the company to suspend flights eastward across the Atlantic. Domestic routes were suspended yesterday afternoon.
    On the morning of the 18th, approximately 13,000 workers at the "Bendix Aircraft Corporation" went on strike because negotiations on the signing of a new contract failed to reach an agreement. The strike affected eight factories of this company located in several states.
    More than 1,200 bus drivers and mechanics belonging to a bus company in eastern Massachusetts went on strike on the 17th. The strike cut off transportation in eighty-one towns in eastern Massachusetts. The strike broke out after negotiations on the signing of a new contract broke down. The workers demanded that the hourly wage be increased by $0.25 in the new contract starting in October. A spokesperson for the company believed that the strike was unlikely to end immediately.
    36,500 employees of the American "International Harvester Company" in Chicago began a strike on the 13th. The strike was caused by the company authorities' refusal to meet the workers' demands for increased seniority pay, pensions, and other benefits in the new contract. News reports said that the company's eighteen factories across the country had been affected.
    Fifteen branches of the "International Harvester Company" also experienced strikes on the 13th, with the number of participants reaching 36,000.
    Workers at a factory of the American Motors Corporation in Detroit also held a strike on the 10th. The strike at this factory affected the work of the company's factories in Kenosha and Milwaukee, forcing them to close.
    The strike by 8,000 clerks and engineers at Chrysler Motor Company, which began on the 11th, has ended victoriously. This strike was caused by the capitalists' rejection of the employees' demands for increased wages and enjoyment of various benefits stipulated by the union. The workers' strike forced the company to completely shut down all eight automobile assembly plants across the country. Thus, the capitalists had no choice but to agree to increase the weekly wage of employees by $2.35.
    In the strike struggle, American capitalists even resorted to attacking strike leaders in broad daylight. According to reports, White, the chairman of the "Chester Cable Company" in Chester, New York, shot and killed Dugan, a union leader who was leading the picket line of striking workers, on the 13th. This barbaric murder aroused the anger of the workers.

    反对资本家转嫁经济危机的损害
    美国各地罢工运动此伏彼起
    本报综合报道　为了反对资本家把在经济危机中受到的损失转嫁到工人们身上，美国各地工人最近不断举行罢工，要求提高工资和其它福利待遇。
    在美国环球航空公司的七千名机械人员在21日罢工，要求增加工资。罢工是在工会和公司当局就增加机械人员工资问题举行的谈判陷入僵局以后举行的。这次罢工迫使这家公司停航越过大西洋向东飞行的航线。国内航线在昨天下午停航。
    18日早晨“潘迪克斯飞机公司”大约一万三千名工人由于关于签订新合同的谈判没有达成协议举行了罢工。罢工影响到这家公司分设在几个州里的八个工厂。
    属于马萨诸塞州东部一家公共汽车公司的一千二百多名汽车司机和机械工人在17日举行了罢工。罢工使得这个州东部八十一个城镇的交通断绝。这次罢工是在关于签订新合同的谈判破裂后爆发的。工人们要求在从10月份开始的新合同中，把每小时的工资提高零点二五美元。这家公司的发言人认为，这次罢工不可能立即结束。
    属于芝加哥的美国“国际收割机公司”的三万六千五百职工在13日开始罢工。罢工是由于公司当局拒绝在新的合同中满足工人们提出的增加工龄津贴、养老金和其他的福利要求而引起的。消息说，这家公司在全国的十八个工厂已经受到影响。
    “万国农具公司”的十五个分厂在13日也都发生了罢工，参加罢工的人数达三万六千名。
    底特律美国汽车公司一个工厂的工人在10日也举行了罢工。这个工厂的罢工影响了这家公司在肯诺沙和密尔窝基两地的工厂的工作，使它们不得不关门。
    克莱斯勒汽车公司的八千名职员和工程人员在11日开始举行的罢工，已经胜利结束。这次罢工是由于资本家拒绝职员们关于增加工资和享受工会规定的各种待遇的要求。工人的罢工曾迫使这家公司在全国的八个汽车装配工厂全部被迫停工。这样，资本家不得不同意把职工每周工资提高二·三五美元。
    在罢工斗争中，美国资本家竟然在光天化日之下对罢工领袖下毒手。据报道，纽约州彻斯特城“彻斯特电缆公司”的董事长怀特13日开枪打死了正在领导罢工工人纠察队的工会领袖杜根。这件野蛮的凶杀案引起了工人们的愤怒。
