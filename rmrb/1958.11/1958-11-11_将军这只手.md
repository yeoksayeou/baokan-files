    The General's Hand
    Private Huang Lizi
    ——During Yang Chengwu's time as a soldier in the company, he strictly observed all regulations just like us. When he needed to ask for leave, he would first salute and report to the squad leader.
    Oh, the General's hand, covered in calluses!
    It commanded the Red Army to seize the Luding Bridge,
    It commanded the Anti-Japanese Army to pluck the "flower of fame" from the Japanese,
    It commanded the People's Liberation Army to ascend the last Chiang Kai-shek fortress in North China—the city walls of Taiyuan;
    Oh, the General's hand, covered in calluses! It laid the cornerstone for the People's Republic.
    Today, the General raises this hand to salute the sergeant squad leader to ask for leave.
    General!
    Your raising your hand is like fighting another annihilation battle,
    What is being annihilated is the bourgeois legal rights ideology.

    将军这只手
    列兵　黄力子
    ——杨成武上将在连队当兵期间，和我们一样严格遵守各项制度。有事请假，先向班长敬礼报告。
    将军这只长满了茧的手啊！
    指挥过红军抢渡大渡河，
    指挥过抗日军摘取日本的“名将之花”，
    指挥过解放军登上华北的最后一个蒋军堡垒—太原城头；
    将军这只长满了茧的手啊！为人民共和国安放过基石。
    今天，将军举起这只手，向下士班长敬礼请假。
    将军啊！
    您一举手又打了一次歼灭战，
    被歼灭的是资产阶级的法权思想。
