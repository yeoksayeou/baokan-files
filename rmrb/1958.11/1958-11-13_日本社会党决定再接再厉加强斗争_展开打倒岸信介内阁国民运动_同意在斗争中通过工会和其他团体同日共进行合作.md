Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th Dispatch: The Japanese Socialist Party held a temporary convention in Tokyo today to discuss strengthening the struggle against the Nobusuke Kishi government's "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill," deciding to launch a national movement to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and demand the dissolution of the Diet.

    This temporary convention formulated the Socialist Party's future struggle policy. The convention was conducted under the following slogans: "Crush the Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill!" "Overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet!" "Dissolve the Diet!" "Launch a national movement to safeguard peace and democracy!" The convention also demanded the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China.

    More than 460 people attended this temporary convention, including representatives from the Socialist Party's central and local organizations, Diet members, and representatives from various organizations supporting the Socialist Party.

    Shigezaburo Suzuki, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party, said in his address at the convention that the current political situation in Japan is very serious. The agreement initially made by the Liberal Democratic Party and the Socialist Party regarding not extending the term of the extraordinary Diet session has been unilaterally torn up by the Liberal Democratic Party in bad faith. The Liberal Democratic Party is trying to forcibly revise the "Police Duties Execution Law" to trample on human rights guaranteed by the Constitution. This is not only a crisis of democracy but also a manifestation of the reactionary policies of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, which is attempting to revise the Constitution and preparing for nuclear war.

    Suzuki said that the Socialist Party's struggle has received the support of the vast majority of the people, while the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party have been shaken. The core force of this struggle is the Socialist Party and the masses of people, with workers at the forefront.

    Suzuki pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi group's decision to extend the Diet session is invalid. The Socialist Party must launch a struggle to crush the Nobusuke Kishi government's plot to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, and dissolve the Diet.

    Representatives from various organizations, including Kenzo Nakajima from the cultural sector and Koreya Senda from the arts sector, also spoke at the meeting, expressing their support for the Socialist Party's struggle against the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet.

    Akira Iwai, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, advocated at the meeting the formation of a national front against the Nobusuke Kishi's reactionary policies. He said that it is important to concentrate the democratic front, which is growing among the people, into the National Conference against the Deterioration of the "Police Duties Execution Law."

    Next, Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, reported to the convention on the progress of the struggle against the Nobusuke Kishi government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law." He said that the Socialist Party condemns the tricks used by the ruling party and believes that these tricks are anti-people and anti-democratic. He emphasized that more than 400 progressive organizations in the country have participated in the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law." Asanuma assured the participants that the Socialist Party will continue to wage a tenacious struggle inside and outside the Diet against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law."

    Asanuma Inejiro said that the Japanese Communist Party is also conducting a struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" and has suggested that the Socialist Party take joint action. Asanuma said that, considering the decision of the Socialist Party's previous convention, the Socialist Party will not directly cooperate with the Communist Party but agrees to cooperate with the Communist Party through trade unions and other organizations.

    The temporary convention received a congratulatory letter from the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party. The letter emphasized that the temporary convention convened by the Socialist Party under the current circumstances is of great significance. The letter said that it is urgent to unite all forces to fight for peace, democracy, and independence in order to repel the attacks of the reactionaries.

    Regarding the issue of whether to hold talks with the Liberal Democratic Party and conduct struggles within the Diet, the convention decided that the Socialist Party's executive body should adopt a flexible attitude.

    At the end of the discussion, the temporary convention passed two resolutions: one on opposing the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" and the other on launching a national movement to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, dissolve the House of Representatives, and safeguard democracy. The resolutions stipulate the launching of a nationwide movement against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" and prescribe various measures for carrying out the struggle to safeguard democracy and oppose the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

    The declaration passed by the temporary convention stated that Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi is a war criminal who once drove the Japanese people to participate in the Pacific War. Nobusuke Kishi's action of submitting the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" to the Diet is nothing more than a basic deployment by the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet to establish a new reactionary system with its own hands. This is an act that restricts the basic human rights of the people, undermines the foundation of freedom and democracy, and challenges peace. The Nobusuke Kishi cabinet's action of submitting this amendment bill to the Diet is a political conspiracy in preparation for war. Based on the basic policy of "the struggle against the bad revision of the Police Duties Execution Law is an uncompromising struggle," which was decided by the Central Committee some time ago, we have continued to wage a powerful struggle inside and outside the Diet. In particular, the broad national movement centered on the National Conference against the Bad Revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," which was initiated by the Socialist Party, has shown an unprecedented postwar high tide. Alarmed by this movement, the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party shamelessly disregarded the agreement between the two parties and attempted to forcibly extend the Diet session. However, the resolution made in disregard of all laws and conventions regarding Diet deliberation work and resembling a coup is invalid, which is an obvious fact.

    The declaration said, we, in the name of the Socialist Party's temporary convention, appeal to all the people: 1. The resolution to extend the Diet session is invalid; 2. We do not recognize the Diet sessions after November 8; 3. The Speaker and Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives should resign immediately.

    The declaration stated that the Socialist Party will stand at the forefront of the people and fight together with the people to defend peace and democracy.

    After the temporary convention ended, Socialist Party Chairman Shigezaburo Suzuki told reporters that, in various senses, the people had been watching the progress of the temporary convention with expectations. I believe that the temporary convention greatly threatened the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party, which brought the situation to this point. Because the policy adopted by the leadership has been unanimously decided by the convention as two motions, a new struggle will be launched from November 13 to realize this policy.

    日本社会党决定再接再厉加强斗争
    展开打倒岸信介内阁国民运动
    同意在斗争中通过工会和其他团体同日共进行合作
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天在东京举行临时大会，讨论了加强反对岸信介政府的“警察官职务执行法修正案”的斗争，决定展开打倒岸信介内阁和要求解散国会的国民运动。
    这次临时大会制订了社会党今后的斗争方针。大会是在这样一些口号下进行的：“粉碎警察官职务执行法修正案！”“打倒岸信介内阁！”“解散国会！”“展开维护和平和民主的国民运动！”大会还要求废除日美“安全条约”和恢复日中邦交。
    出席这次临时大会的有社会党的中央和地方组织的代表、国会议员和各地支持社会党的团体的代表等四百六十多人。
    社会党中央执行委员会委员长铃木茂三郎在大会上致词说，日本目前的政治形势非常严重。自由民主党和社会党起初曾经作出的关于不延长临时国会会期的协议，已经被自由民主党背信弃义地单方面加以撕毁。自由民主党正在要强行修改“警察官职务执行法”，以蹂躏宪法所保障的人权。这不仅是民主的危机，也是正在企图修改宪法和准备核战争的岸信介内阁的反动政策的表现。
    铃木说，社会党所进行的斗争得到了绝大多数国民的支持，而岸信介内阁和自由民主党却发生了动摇。这个斗争的核心力量是社会党和以工人为首的人民群众。
    铃木指出，岸信介集团延长国会会期的决议是无效的，社会党要展开斗争，粉碎岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋，打倒岸信介内阁，解散国会。
    文化界代表中岛健藏、艺术界代表千田是也等各团体的代表也在会上发言，表示支持社会党反对岸信介内阁的斗争。
    日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章在会上倡议组成反对岸信介反动政策的国民战线。他说，把正在人民中成长的民主战线，集中到反对恶劣修改“警察官职务执行法”国民会议里来，是很重要的。
    接着，社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎向大会报告了关于进行反对岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”的斗争的经过情况。他说，社会党谴责执政党所采用的那些诡计，并且认为这些诡计是反人民、反民主的。他强调指出，国内有四百多个进步团体参加了反对修改“警察官职务执行法”的斗争。浅沼向与会者保证说，社会党将在国会内外继续进行顽强的斗争，反对修改“警察官职务执行法”。
    浅沼稻次郎说，日本共产党也在进行反对修改“警察官职务执行法”的斗争，并且建议社会党采取联合行动。浅沼说，考虑到社会党上届大会的决定，社会党将不同共产党直接进行合作，但是同意通过工会和其他团体同共产党进行合作。
    临时大会收到了日本共产党中央委员会的贺信。贺信强调指出，社会党在目前情况下召开的临时大会具有重要意义。贺信说，迫切需要团结一切力量为和平、民主和独立而斗争，以便击退反动派的进攻。
    关于是否同自由民主党举行会谈和在国会内进行斗争的问题，大会决定由社会党的执行机构采取灵活的态度办事。
    临时大会在讨论结束时通过了关于反对修改“警察官职务执行法”和关于展开打倒岸信介内阁、解散众议院、维护民主的国民运动等两项决议。决议规定展开全国性的反对修改“警察官职务执行法”的运动，并且规定了展开维护民主和反对修改日美“安全条约”的斗争的各项措施。
    临时大会通过的宣言说，岸信介首相是曾经驱使日本国民参加太平洋战争的战犯。这个岸信介向国会提出“警察官职务执行法修正案”这个行动，不外乎是由岸信介内阁亲手建立新的反动体制的一个基本部署。这是限制国民的基本人权、破坏自由和民主的基础、向和平挑战的行为。岸信介内阁向国会提出这项修正法案这个行动就是它准备战争的政治阴谋。我们根据中央委员会在前些时候所决定的“反对恶劣修改警察官职务执行法的斗争是毫不妥协的斗争”这一基本方针，在国会内外继续进行了强有力的斗争。特别是以社会党倡议成立的反对恶劣修改“警察官职务执行法”国民会议为中心的广泛的国民运动显示出空前未有的战后最大的高潮。对这个运动感到慌张的岸信介政府和自由民主党，曾经恬不知耻地不顾两党之间的协议，企图强行延长国会会期。但是，不顾关于国会审议工作的一切法令和惯例而作出的形同政变的决议是无效的，这是一个明显的事实。
    宣言说，我们用社会党临时大会的名义向全体国民呼吁：一、延长国会会期的决议是无致的；二、不承认11月8日以后的国会会议；三、众议院正副议长应该立刻辞职。
    宣言表示，社会党要站在人民的前列，同人民一道为保卫和平和民主而斗争。
    社会党委员长铃木茂三郎在临时大会结束以后向记者发表谈话说，在各种意义上说来，国民曾经抱着期望注视着临时大会的进展情况。我认为，临时大会大大地威胁了把局面弄到这种地步的岸信介内阁和自由民主党。因为领导机构一向采取的方针已经作为两个议案由大会全体一致地加以决定，所以将从11月13日起展开新的斗争，来实现这个方针。
