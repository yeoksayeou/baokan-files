    Long Articles Should Be Divided into Sections
    There are at least two advantages to dividing long articles into smaller sections: First, long articles mostly discuss several issues. If these are divided into sections according to these issues, with subheadings added, it becomes easy to understand the article's content and avoid forgetting the beginning after reading the end. Second, everyone is very busy now and may not have time to read a long article all at once. If a long article is divided into sections, people can read a few sections in a shorter period and finish the rest later when they have time.

    长篇文章要多分小节
    长篇文章多分些小节，好处至少有两个：一、长篇文章，大都是要说好些问题，如果按照这些问题分成小节，再加上小标题，就很容易使人领会文章的内容，不致读了后面忘了前面；二、现在大家都很忙，不一定有时间把长篇文章一下看完，如果把长篇文章分成小节，人们在较短的时间内可以先看几小节，以后有时间再看完。
