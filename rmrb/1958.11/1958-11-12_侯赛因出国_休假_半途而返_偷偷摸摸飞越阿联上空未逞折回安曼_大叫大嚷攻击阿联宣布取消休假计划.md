Xinhua News Agency report: Hussein, the King of the small Jordanian dynasty, has added another episode to his farcical "vacation" abroad. According to Cairo newspapers, Queen Zein al-Sharaf, in an attempt to save the Jordanian dynasty and the rule of imperialism in Jordan, suggested that Hussein abdicate in favor of his youngest brother, the twelve-year-old Prince Hassan. The British government supports this plan. It is said that Hussein's "vacation" abroad is related to this matter.

Hussein, en route from Amman to Western Europe, automatically turned back to Amman after flying over the airspace of the Syrian region of the United Arab Republic without prior permission. In a radio address in Amman, he insisted that planes of the United Arab Republic had attempted to "force" his plane to land at Damascus airport, and later "attempted to attack" his plane.

The king of this Hashemite dynasty, in a broadcast after convening an emergency meeting of the Jordanian cabinet, also threatened that his government would take "necessary measures to respond to this act of aggression" in order to safeguard the "dignity" of his dynasty.

However, Hussein's speech revealed the fact that his plane had not obtained permission before flying over the airspace of the Syrian region. He admitted that at the time, only the pilot of his plane notified the Damascus authorities of the border crossing request via radio.

Hussein said in his speech that he "has temporarily cancelled his vacation plans."

Saad Afra, Director of the Information Bureau of the United Arab Republic, issued a statement on the evening of the 10th, saying that the accusations made by Amman Radio against the United Arab Republic in its afternoon broadcast on the 10th were "completely absurd and far-fetched."

Amman Radio broadcast that when the plane of Jordanian King Hussein flew over Syrian territory, it became the target of attack by UAE jet planes. The statement said: "This is, in fact, a piece of news with a large element of imagination."

The statement pointed out that the actual situation was that this morning, a Jordanian military plane crossed the Syrian border without prior permission, thereby violating all international regulations regarding aviation rules.

The statement said that the Damascus authorities had asked the Jordanian plane to state its nationality, but it vaguely stated only that it wished to pass over the Syrian region without further explanation. The plane also did not indicate that King Hussein was on board.

The statement said that the Damascus authorities asked the plane to land and obtain the necessary permission to continue flying in accordance with the regulations applicable to planes crossing the border without prior approval. The plane did not do so, but notified the airport authorities that it did not want to land and wanted to fly back to Amman. At this time, a patrol of UAE jet fighters on a routine flight was ordered to escort it to the Jordanian border.

The statement continued, Hussein's communiqué broadcast today admitted that the plane he was on did not contact the authorities in the Syrian region until it had finally crossed the border and flown over the airspace of the region. The communiqué also clearly indicated that the plane did not inform the Damascus airport of its nationality or the specific circumstances of King Hussein being on board.

The headquarters of the First Army of the United Arab Republic also issued a statement tonight regarding this incident.

The statement said that when Hussein's plane flew over the airspace of the Syrian region, the planes of the UAE Air Force patrolling over this region were ordered to follow the Jordanian plane until it flew out of the airspace of the region, in order to carry out instructions regarding defending the security of the region and preventing possible aerial aggression.

The statement said that the Jordanian side's claim that UAE planes attacked the Jordanian plane in order to force it to land is untrue.

The statement said that our planes were fully capable of forcing the plane to land at Damascus airport, and if it refused, we could have shot it down. But the fact is that our planes only followed the plane and did not obstruct its flight until it disappeared in the airspace of this region.

The statement concluded that the responsible authorities of the United Arab Republic had issued passes to Jordanian Royal Air Force planes last week allowing them to cross over the Syrian region. Their planes completed their journey without being interfered with by the UAE's planes.

### 侯赛因出国“休假”半途而返  偷偷摸摸飞越阿联上空未逞折回安曼  大叫大嚷攻击阿联宣布取消休假计划

    侯赛因出国“休假”半途而返
    偷偷摸摸飞越阿联上空未逞折回安曼
    大叫大嚷攻击阿联宣布取消休假计划
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：约旦小王朝国王侯赛因扮演的所谓出国“休假”的滑稽剧又加了一幕插曲。据开罗报纸日前报道，为了设法挽救约旦王朝和帝国主义在约旦的统治，约旦宰恩太后建议侯赛因让位给他的最小的兄弟、十二岁的哈桑王子。而英国政府支持此项计划。据说，侯赛因这次出国“休假”与此事有关。
    侯赛因在从安曼去西欧的途中，由于事先未获准许，擅自飞越阿拉伯联合共和国叙利亚地区领空而自动折回安曼。他在安曼发表广播演说，硬说阿联的飞机曾经企图“强迫”他乘坐的飞机在大马士革机场降落，后来又“企图袭击”他的座机。
    这个哈希姆小王朝的国王在召集约旦内阁紧急会议后发表的广播中还威胁说，他的政府要采取“必要的措施来回答这种侵略行动”，以维护他的王朝的“尊严”。
    但是，侯赛因的演说表明了这样的事实：他的座机在飞越叙利亚地区领空以前并未获得许可。他承认，当时，只是由他的座机的驾驶员通过无线电把越境的要求通知大马士革当局。
    侯赛因在演说中说，他“已经暂时取消去度假的计划”。
    阿拉伯联合共和国新闻局局长萨德·阿弗拉10日晚间发表声明说，安曼电台在10日下午的广播中对阿联进行的指责“完全是荒谬和牵强附会的”。
    安曼电台的广播说当约旦国王侯赛因的座机飞临叙利亚领土上空的时候，它成为阿联的喷气飞机攻击的目标。声明说：“这事实上是想像占很大成分的一则消息。”
    声明指出，实际的情况是，今天上午，一架约旦的军用飞机未经事先准许，越过叙利亚的边境，从而违反了有关航空规则的所有国际条例。
    声明说，大马士革当局曾经要求约旦飞机告知它的国籍，但是它极端含糊地只表示它希望通过叙利亚地区上空而不作进一步的解释来回答。飞机也没有表示机上坐着侯赛因国王。
    声明说，大马士革当局要求飞机着陆，并且根据适用于未经事先获准而越境的飞机的规定，获得继续飞行的必要的许可。这架飞机不这样做，却通知机场当局，它不愿意着陆而要飞回安曼去。在这个时候，进行一次例行飞行的阿联的喷气战斗机巡逻队奉命护送它到约旦边境。
    声明接着说，侯赛因国王今天广播的公报承认，他所乘的飞机直到最后过了边境而飞临叙利亚地区的领空时，才同这个地区的当局接触。公报也同样很清楚地表明飞机没有将它的国籍或者侯赛因国王坐在机上的具体情况告知大马士革机场。
    阿拉伯联合共和国第一军总部今晚也就这一事件发表了声明。
    声明说，当侯赛因的座机飞越叙利亚地区的领空时，正在这个地区上空巡逻的阿联空军的飞机为了执行关于保卫这个地区安全、防止可能的空中侵略的指示，便受命追随这架约旦飞机，直到这架飞机飞出这个地区的上空为止。
    声明说，约旦方面声明说，阿联的飞机为了迫使约旦飞机着陆，曾经对它进行袭击，这种说法是不真实的。
    声明说，我们的飞机完全有能力迫使这架飞机在大马士革机场着陆，如果它表示拒绝，我们也能够把它打下来。但是事实是，我们的飞机只是追随这架飞机，而没有阻碍它的飞行，直到它在这个地区的上空消失为止。
    声明最后说，阿联负责当局在上星期给约旦皇家空军飞机签发了可以越过叙利亚地区上空的通行证。他们的飞机并没有遭到阿联方面的飞机的干预而飞完它们的行程。
