    Red Flag Commune Canteen Strives for the Top
    Ninety Meals Without Repetition
    (Our dispatch) The Red Flag People's Commune in Hengshui Township, Mengjin County, Henan Province, has established more than three hundred public canteens that are praised by everyone. Since September, they have managed to provide ninety meals a month, each different from the last.
    Under the battle cry of "Make all commune members eat their fill, eat well, and be satisfied," all cooks have shown great enthusiasm and creativity. Even coarse foods like wild vegetables and sweet potatoes can be cooked in dozens of ways, so that commune members feel like they are eating "delicacies from land and sea."
    Currently, 279 out of these 307 canteens have implemented a "one hall, three stoves" system for the elderly and weak, with five meals a day, and a "three waters, five flavors" station. "One hall, three stoves" means that in one canteen there are stoves for the young and strong, the elderly and children, and the sick and pregnant women. The elderly, sick, and pregnant women can eat five meals a day. The "three waters, five flavors" station provides washing water, rinsing water, and boiled water in the canteen, and the five flavors station has condiments such as vinegar, soy sauce, chili, salt, and garlic juice for commune members to choose from when eating. All canteens regularly conduct detailed surveys among commune members to understand their dining requirements and tastes, and pay special attention to the dining situation, discussions, and feedback of commune members in the dining hall every day, so as to improve the variety of dishes in a timely manner. Currently, 214 canteens in the commune have managed to provide ninety different meals a month. Commune members can eat steamed buns, noodles with fried sauce, fried cakes, steamed cakes, scallion rolls, fried sweet potato balls, and more. They also eat vegetable pancakes, but they make them delicious. One dish called Five-Spice Paper Roll Pancake, is very similar to "spring rolls," and the masses love to eat it. The method is: chop five kinds of vegetables and wild vegetables such as pumpkin and sweet potato leaves into fine pieces, add oil, salt, star anise, chopped green onion, garlic juice and other seasonings, then spread the white flour as thin as paper, and roll the mixed vegetable filling inside and steam it.
    These canteens were not so well-run and popular with the masses from the very beginning. In the early stages, more than 150 landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and people with serious capitalist ideas mixed into the canteens and made a mess of them. The Party committee mobilized the masses to thoroughly remove these bad guys from the canteen management and cooking work, and immediately transferred 32 Communist Party members, 63 Communist Youth League members, and 85 "active builders of communism" to be cooks and managers. Zhang Jinsheng, the deputy secretary of the commune's Party committee, also went deep into the 17th canteen to personally manage the meals, and together with the canteen staff, created the aforementioned "one hall, three stoves" system and many different dishes. He immediately convened an on-site meeting, and as a result, the work of more than 300 canteens in the entire commune was gradually improved. (Chen Jian)

### 红旗公社食堂争上游  九十顿饭菜不重样

    红旗公社食堂争上游
    九十顿饭菜不重样
    本报讯　河南省孟津县横水乡红旗人民公社办了三百多个人人称赞，个个叫好的公共食堂，从9月份起已经做到一个月九十顿饭菜顿顿不重样。
    在“使所有社员，吃饱、吃好、吃满意”的战斗口号下，全体炊事员发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，即使像野菜和红薯那样的粗食，经过精心烹调，也能做出几十种花样，使社员们如吃“山珍海味”。
    现在，这三百零七个食堂，有二百七十九个食堂实行了“一堂三个灶”老弱五顿餐和三水五味台的制度。一堂三个灶，就是在一个食堂中有青壮年灶、老年小孩灶、病人产妇灶；老年人，病人，产妇每天能吃五顿饭；三水五味台是在食堂内设有洗脸水、漱口水、白开水，五味台上放有醋、酱油、辣椒、盐面、蒜汁等调味品，供社员们吃饭时选用。所有食堂都经常在社员中进行详细的调查，了解他们吃饭的要求和味口；特别注意社员们每天在饭厅吃饭的情况、议论和反映，以便及时改善饭菜的花色品种。现在全社已经有二百一十四个食堂做到一个月九十顿饭菜顿顿不重样。社员可以在这里吃到包子、炸酱面、油饼、蒸糕、葱花卷、炸红薯丸子等等。他们也吃菜馍，但做得好吃。有一种叫五香纸卷馍，很像“春卷”，群众非常爱吃。做法是：把南瓜、红薯叶等五种家菜和野菜切成细小碎沫，加上油盐、大料、葱花、蒜汁和其他作料，把白面赶的像薄纸一样，然后把拌好的菜馅卷在里面蒸熟。
    这些食堂并不是一开始就办得这么好，这么受群众欢迎。开办初期，有一百五十多名地、富、反、坏分子和有严重资本主义思想的人混入食堂，把食堂搞的一塌糊涂。党委会发动群众，把这些坏家伙从食堂管理和炊事工作中彻底清除了出去，立即调配了三十二名共产党员、六十三名共青团员和八十五名“建设共产主义积极分子”当炊事员和管理人员。这个公社的党委副书记张金生还深入第十七食堂，亲自管理伙食，同食堂工作人员一起创造了上述“一堂三灶”以及许多饭菜花样，马上召开现场会议，于是全公社三百多个食堂的工作都陆续得到改进。　　　（陈健）
