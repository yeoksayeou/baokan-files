Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 3rd: The publication of the important document "Chairman Mao on Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers" has greatly inspired the people of Shanghai, who have a glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle and have achieved victory.

The assertion that "American imperialism is a paper tiger," already familiar to people, has again become the focus of conversation these past two days.

Li Peiying, the furnace chief of the No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, a national red banner unit for high production in open hearth furnaces, whose furnace utilization coefficient has been leading the country for two years, said excitedly after reading this document: "American imperialism often uses its steel production to scare people. However, what is the annual increase rate of steel production in the United States, and what is the annual increase rate of our steel production? Our national steel production this year has doubled compared to last year. But what about the United States? Its speed cannot be compared with ours at all."

Zhu Yingru, a retired female worker in her sixties and a participant in the Shanghai workers' third armed uprising in 1927, said after reading Chairman Mao's article: More than thirty years ago, the reactionary forces seemed much stronger than the revolutionary forces on the surface, but we fearlessly surrounded the imperialist patrol rooms, demonstrated and marched in the concessions, and engaged in armed struggle with the reactionaries. Chairman Mao pointed out long ago that "a single spark can start a prairie fire," and that imperialism and its running dogs are all paper tigers. Now the world situation is very different from the past. A single spark has developed into a raging fire. I fully believe that all the imperialists and their running dogs in the world, no matter how they struggle, will eventually be burned to death.

Residents in the lanes of Huaihai Road held a warm discussion meeting yesterday afternoon. Everyone unanimously said that Chairman Mao's words are absolutely true, and that what was predicted twenty years ago is exactly the same as the actual situation today.

    北京上海人民进行座谈讨论
    据新华社上海3日电　“毛泽东同志论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的重要文献的发表，给了具有光荣反帝斗争传统并取得了胜利的上海人民以极大的鼓舞。
    “美帝国主义是只纸老虎”这个早已为人们所熟悉的论断，这两天又成为人们谈话的中心。
    两年来平炉利用系数一直在全国领先的全国平炉高产红旗上钢三厂平炉车间炉长李佩盈看了这篇文献后，兴奋地说：“美帝国主义经常以它的钢铁产量来吓唬人，可是，美国的钢产量每年增加比例是多少，我们的钢产量每年增加比例是多少？我们今年全国钢产量比去年增加了一倍。可是，美国呢？它的速度根本不能跟我们相比。”
    六十多岁的退休女工、1927年上海工人三次武装起义的参加者朱英如读了毛主席的文章后说：三十多年前，反动势力表面上看起来比革命力量强大得多，可是我们毫无畏惧地去包围帝国主义的巡捕房，在租界上示威游行，和反动派进行武装斗争。很早以前毛主席就指出“星星之火，可以燎原”，帝国主义和它的走狗都是纸老虎。现在世界形势已经大大的和过去不同了，星星之火已经发展成熊熊大火，我完全相信，世界上所有的帝国主义和他们的走狗不管怎样挣扎，最后都要被烧死。
    住在淮海坊的里弄居民们昨天下午举行了一次热烈的座谈会。大家一致说毛主席的话句句千真万确，二十年前预料的事和今天的实际情况完全一样。
