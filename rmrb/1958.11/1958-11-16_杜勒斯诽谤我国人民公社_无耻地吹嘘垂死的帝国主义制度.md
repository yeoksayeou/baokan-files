Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 15th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles delivered a speech on the 13th, viciously slandering the great socialist construction of the Chinese people. This speech was delivered at a Chamber of Commerce in Seattle, and its purpose was obviously to provoke the Asian countries participating in the Colombo Plan Ministerial Meeting in Seattle and divert people's attention from the United States' policy of economic plunder.

Dulles's slander against China focused on the people's commune system that has sprung up vigorously in China. He shamelessly and stubbornly described the people's communes, voluntarily created by the Chinese working people, as "imposed on the 650 million (Chinese) mainland people" and as a "backward, large-scale system of servitude." Dulles made no secret of his hatred and fear of China's construction achievements. Like a madman, he said that China's system would "fail," and he "finds it hard to believe that (the Chinese people's) efforts will succeed or last."

In his speech, Dulles also tried his best to embellish the dying imperialist system. Although human rights have been brutally trampled in Western countries, and millions of people are living in indescribable misery under the attack of the economic crisis, Dulles still shamelessly said that the capitalist system has so-called "human dignity, greater political freedom" and so-called "material happiness."

Speaking of the economic development of Southeast Asian countries, Dulles boasted with predatory intentions that these countries' efforts to develop their economies "should be supplemented by economic and technical assistance programs from more developed member countries. And the United States is such a member country." In this regard, he also talked about the United States' intention to expand private investment and foreign trade aimed at controlling the economies of other countries.

### 杜勒斯诽谤我国人民公社  无耻地吹嘘垂死的帝国主义制度

    杜勒斯诽谤我国人民公社
    无耻地吹嘘垂死的帝国主义制度
    新华社15日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯13日发表了一篇恶毒地污蔑中国人民伟大的社会主义建设的演说。这篇演说是在西雅图的商会上发表的，它的目的显然是想挑拨参加在西雅图举行的科伦坡计划国家部长级会议的亚洲国家同中国的关系，转移人们对美国的经济掠夺政策的注意。
    杜勒斯对中国的诽谤集中在风起云涌地在中国建立起来的人民公社制度上。他无耻地硬把中国劳动人民自愿创建的人民公社说成是“强加在六亿五千万（中国）大陆人民身上的”，是一种“落后的大规模奴役制度”。杜勒斯毫不掩饰他对中国建设成就的仇视和恐惧。他像疯子一样说，中国的制度会“失败”，他“很难相信（中国人民）这种努力会成功或者持久。”
    杜勒斯在演说里还竭力粉饰垂死的帝国主义制度。尽管在西方国家里人权已遭到粗暴的蹂躏，千百万人在经济危机的袭击下过着难以形容的悲惨生活，但是杜勒斯还是厚着脸皮说，资本主义制度有所谓“人的尊严、更大的政治自由”以及所谓“物质幸福”。
    谈到东南亚国家的经济发展问题，杜勒斯怀着掠夺的目的而吹嘘说，这些国家发展经济的努力“要由比较发达的成员国的经济和技术援助计划加以补充。而美国就是这样一个成员国”。他在这方面还谈到美国要扩大目的在于控制其他国家经济的私人投资和对外贸易。
