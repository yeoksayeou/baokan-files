Half-Monthly Agricultural Situation

"Cold Dew" (October 9th) – "Frost's Descent" (October 24th)

During this half-month, the rural areas across the country are still intensively engaged in autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting.

During this period, the main crops being harvested are potatoes, cotton, late rice, and some oil crops. In northern regions, the widespread digging of sweet potatoes began after early October. Many areas had completed the harvest before "Frost's Descent," while areas with slower progress will be finished by early November. Many regions have greatly accelerated the harvest speed by using potato-digging plows.

In some areas of the Huai River Basin and the Yangtze River Basin, the digging of sweet potatoes also began in mid-October, with the full-scale digging to be completed around "Start of Winter."

Cotton-growing areas continued to pick cotton during this period. By mid-October, Shaanxi had picked cotton four to five times, with 70% of the cotton already harvested; the Hubei cotton-growing area had generally picked twice, with half having picked four times or more. While picking cotton, many cotton-growing areas also took various measures to promote early maturity of cotton and prevent frost damage.

Most areas in the south generally began reaping and harvesting the single-season late rice, entering the peak of the harvest in late October. Judging from the yields of the late rice already harvested, the slogan of "late rice catching up with early rice" has been realized in many areas. In Ganxian County, Jiangxi, the already harvested more than 100,000 mu of late rice has an average yield of over 1,100 jin per mu, exceeding the average yield of early rice by more than 270 jin. Some early-planted double-cropping late rice in southern regions has also reached harvest time.

After entering October, the three northeastern provinces and Inner Mongolia successively saw a high tide of plowing. The plowing targets in these areas are to complete the plowing of all autumn stubble land that should be plowed before the ground freezes. In these areas, many fast and high-quality plowing "satellites" have also emerged during the plowing campaign.

Many areas in the south are also plowing while harvesting. Counties with heavy autumn plowing tasks have prepared a large number of deep plowing tools. For example, before plowing, Pinghu County, Zhejiang, rushed to manufacture more than 8,000 deep plowing plows and more than 2,200 rope-traction machines.

Autumn sowing in the Yellow River Basin was basically completed before "Frost's Descent." Although there was much rain in the Huai River and Yangtze River Basins in mid-October, wheat sowing continued. In the Huaibei area, the daily sowing progress remained at 600,000 mu despite the cloudy and rainy conditions. Many areas began checking seedlings and replanting in wheat fields after autumn sowing. Many counties in Hebei Province launched a "ten checks" and "ten replanting" campaign in wheat fields, ensuring inspection plot by plot and row by row, replenishing whatever is lacking. Some people's communes in Jiangsu Province have established a responsibility system for wheat field management.

Oilseed rape seedlings that were raised and transplanted in Sichuan, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei and other regions generally have three to five true leaves, and some have begun transplanting to the main fields. Winter oilseed rape in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian will begin sowing in early November. This year, many oilseed rape producing areas have achieved "sowing, managing, and managing well after sowing," carrying out oilseed rape seedling management in advance. Judging from the situation in some areas, the sowing progress of some direct-sown oilseed rape is very slow, and many counties still have about half of the direct-sown oilseed rape to be sown after "Frost's Descent." This is a noteworthy issue in this year's autumn sowing of oilseed rape.

Selecting and reserving good seeds for increased production next year, preventing overwintering pests, and preparing for large-scale construction of farmland water conservancy projects are also some of the agricultural activities in many regions during this stage.

    半月农情
    “寒露”（10月9日）——“霜降”（10月24日）
    在这半个月里，全国农村仍在紧张地进行秋收、秋耕和秋种。
    在这个时期，主要收获的作物是薯类、棉花、晚稻和部分油料等。北方地区自10月上旬以后，进入普遍收刨甘薯阶段。许多地区已在“霜降”前收获完了，进度迟缓的地区将要拖到11月上旬才能结束。不少地区由于采用了刨薯犁，大大加快了收获速度。
    淮河流域、长江流域的一些地区，在10月中也开始收刨甘薯，这里的全面收刨要在“立冬”前后。
    各棉区在这个时期继续收摘棉花。到10月中旬，陕西已摘花四到五次，已有70％的棉花收摘回来；湖北棉区普遍收摘两次，半数摘了四次以上。许多棉区在收摘棉花的同时，还采取了各种措施促进棉花早熟并防止霜害。
    南方大部地区普遍开镰收割一季晚稻，10月下旬进入收割大忙。从已收获的晚稻产量看，许多地区提出“晚稻赶早稻”的口号已经实现。江西赣县已收的十万多亩晚稻，平均亩产一千一百多斤，超出早稻平均产量二百七十多斤。南方地区的部分早插的双季晚稻也到了收割的时候。
    东北三省和内蒙古等地进入10月以后相继出现翻地高潮。这些地区的翻地指标是：在封冻以前翻完应翻的秋茬地。这些地区在翻地运动中，还出现了不少进度快、质量好的翻地“卫星”。
    南方许多地区也在边收边耕。这里的秋耕任务大的县，都准备了大量深翻工具。如浙江平湖县在耕前赶制了深耕犁八千多部、绳索牵引机二千二百多台。
    黄河流域的秋播在“霜降”前已基本结束。淮河、长江流域10月中虽然多雨，但播麦工作仍在继续进行。淮北地区在阴雨情况下，每天播种进度仍保持六十万亩。许多地区都在秋播以后开始了麦田的查苗、补种。河北省许多县开展麦田“十查”、“十补”运动，做到逐块检查，逐垅检查，缺啥补啥。江苏省的一些人民公社，建立了麦田管理责任制。
    四川、浙江、江苏、安徽、湖北等地区育苗移栽的油菜，一般已有三到五个真叶，部分已开始向本田里移植。广东、广西、福建的越冬油菜将在11月上旬开始播种。今年许多油菜产区都做到了“随种，随管，种完，管好”，提前进行了油菜苗期管理。从一些地区的情况看，部分直播油菜的播种进度则很缓慢，不少县还有半数左右的直播油菜有待“霜降”以后播种。这是今年秋播油菜中的一个值得注意的问题。
    为明年增产选留良种、防治越冬害虫和为大规模兴修农田水利作好准备等工作，也是许多地区在这个阶段的部分农事活动。
