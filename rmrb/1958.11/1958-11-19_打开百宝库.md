Opening the Treasure Trove
Liang Yingyong, Vice Minister of Chemical Industry

The use of abundant agricultural products and by-products to produce chemical products on a large scale has broken through the scope of solely relying on minerals in the past, which greatly expands the field of raw material acquisition for the chemical industry. Developing the chemical industry vigorously by using agricultural products and by-products also has many characteristics, the most important of which are: first, generally speaking, the required equipment is simple, the production method is relatively easy, and the construction cost is low. Second, agricultural products and by-products are a kind of raw material that can never be exhausted, because they can grow continuously year after year, harvested and then planted, planted and then harvested, so they will provide us with industrial raw materials cyclically. Third, China's mineral resources are extremely rich, and they are always the main raw materials of the chemical industry, which is beyond doubt. However, the distribution of agricultural products is more common than that of mineral resources, and the possibility of being widely used is even greater.

So, what exactly can agricultural products and by-products be used for in the chemical industry?

From Sweet Potatoes Onward

Sweet potatoes and other tubers (including potatoes, taro, etc.) are one of China's main agricultural products and one of the high-yield crops. How to effectively use so many sweet potatoes is an important issue.

Sweet potatoes are good staple food and feed. They can also be processed into starch for food, and starch can be further processed into non-staple food, snacks, medicinal and edible glucose, lactic acid, humectants, dextrin, syrup, sorbitol, mannitol, and so on. Starch and starch products can be used in one or two hundred industries, and can even be used to make heat-resistant glue and plastics, explosives, etc. Now, let's just talk about the most important uses of sweet potatoes in the chemical industry.

Sweet potatoes can be fermented to produce alcohol, acetone, butanol, glycerol, isoamyl alcohol, and so on. Acetone and butanol are used as organic solvents and plastic plasticizers, and they have extremely wide applications in the chemical industry, with large quantities. Other methods are far less convenient and economical than using sweet potatoes. Alcohol has even wider uses. Alcohol is a good fuel for tractors and automobiles. In addition to being used as antifreeze, it is a great treasure in the chemical industry. Alcohol can be used to make many very valuable chemical products urgently needed by the national economy. The most basic ones include acetaldehyde, acetic acid, polyethylene, vinyl chloride, polystyrene, chloroethanol, ethylene oxide, dichloroethane, ethylene glycol, ethylbenzene, ether, various esters, butadiene, buna rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber, and polysulfide rubber, etc., basic raw materials, intermediate products, and finished products. Now, let's just illustrate the uses of several products.

Polyethylene is a plastic with excellent insulation properties, which can be widely used in the motor and electrical appliance industry, which is of great significance to China's rapidly developing power industry.

Ethylene glycol is a good antifreeze and the main raw material for the synthetic fiber Terylene. Ethylene glycol can be nitrated to make mining explosives. Due to our large-scale and rapid construction, millions of tons of explosives will be needed next year to meet the needs of mining, railway, and hydropower station construction. China's current production of ammonium nitrate is far from meeting this need. Therefore, while increasing the production of ammonium nitrate, we must produce as much ethylene glycol explosive as possible.

Dichloroethane is a good solvent and a good fumigation insecticide. The increase in grain reserves has also increased the need for fumigants, and production should be organized appropriately. Dichloroethane is also the raw material of the important fungicide zineb. Through dichloroethane, polyvinyl chloride plastic and fiber can also be produced. Polyvinyl chloride plastic has a very wide range of uses, but it consumes too much electricity when made with calcium carbide, so its development is greatly limited at present. It is more economical to produce polyvinyl chloride by this method, and it can also be used in conjunction with the calcium carbide method in the future.

Using alcohol, a variety of synthetic rubbers can also be produced, such as Buna, styrene-butadiene, and polysulfide rubber. The rapid development of China's national economy requires extremely large quantities of rubber raw materials. Natural rubber is an important source, but the development of natural rubber, both in terms of time and quantity, is far from meeting the needs, and the quantity of imports is also limited. Therefore, vigorously organizing the production of synthetic rubber has become one of the most important tasks of the chemical industry. According to China's current resource situation, vigorously organizing the production of Buna rubber is the most realistic solution to meet the needs of industry, agriculture, transportation, and people's lives. Of course, with the gradual increase in benzene resources, the output of styrene-butadiene rubber can also be gradually increased.

Ethylene, an important chemical raw material, is extracted from petroleum waste gas in almost all countries in the world. In addition to this source, China can also obtain it in large quantities from alcohol. In this way, our path to obtaining ethylene is very broad.

Are Rice Husks and Buckwheat Hulls Worth Anything?

Are rice husks, buckwheat hulls, oat hulls, cottonseed hulls, corn cobs, bagasse, sunflower seed hulls, and peanut shells worth anything? This question is completely reasonable. In the past, these things were indeed not worth much. At most, they could be burned for fuel or used to feed livestock. Although it cannot be said that they were useless, their uses were only like this. However, in the current era of developed chemical industry, the situation has changed, and these things can no longer be underestimated. They are already materials with high economic value, and their value should be greatly increased. From these things, a large number of chemical products such as furfural, alcohol, acetic acid, methanol, lignin, and activated carbon can be extracted.

Now, let's take furfural, which can be extracted in the largest quantities, as an example. According to experimental research, the furfural content of the following materials is about: oat hulls and corn cobs 19%-20%, cottonseed hulls 17%-18%, bagasse 15%-17%, and rice husks 11%-12%. Of course, according to current technical conditions, it is not possible to extract all of it, but because there are so many of these things, as long as the recovery rate reaches 60%-70%, the quantity is still very considerable, not to mention that it is "waste" utilization! In addition to extracting furfural, alcohol, activated carbon, acetic acid, etc. can also be produced.

What exactly are the uses of furfural? According to the information provided by the Beijing Research Institute of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, a wide variety of chemical products can be manufactured using furfural as a raw material. At present, it can be roughly divided into ten aspects. Those that are technically mature or can be solved through efforts include: 1. Nylon 66, Nylon 6 (i.e., Capron), Nylon 7 (i.e., Enant); 2. Polyester reinforced plastics; 3. Furfuryl alcohol resin plastics; 4. Furfural acetone resin; 5. Vinyl furan resin; 6. Vinyl furan butadiene copolymer synthetic rubber; 7. Artificial serum; 8. Various plasticizers; 9. Industrial solvents; 10. Pesticides, insecticides, preservatives, etc.

Assuming that 100,000 tons of furfural can be made from the above resources in the next two years, using these furfural to make synthetic fibers can meet the needs of about 6.4 million sets of aircraft tires, large tire cord fabrics and cords. The service life of tires equipped with synthetic fibers can be extended by about one time. If 100,000 tons of furfural are all made into polyester resin plastics, the car bodies of 2 million cars can be manufactured. This only illustrates its economic value, and in fact, it is not necessary to do these things completely. This plastic can also be widely used in industry, transportation, and in rural areas. Because this plastic has higher alkali resistance and temperature resistance than phenolic plastics, and it is relatively cheap, it can be used as linings for various reactors and storage tanks, and can be made into various industrial pipe fittings. The wood formation rate in our country is generally low, and a large amount of wood chips and sawdust have not been utilized. If furfural resin is widely used as an adhesive, the utilization rate can be greatly improved. In rural areas, the high tide of large-scale transformation of rural housing and the construction of new houses will soon appear, and the supply of wood will inevitably feel seriously inadequate. Furfuryl alcohol plastic can be used to replace wood in large quantities to manufacture doors and windows, and can equip houses and civil appliances. Made into reinforced plastic, it can also be used as load-bearing house components, beams, pillars, and main parts or accessories for vehicles and farm tools. If this resin is used in combination with other resins, its uses will be even wider. For example, epoxy resin has extremely important uses in industry and national defense, but it is too expensive. If it is used in combination with furfural acetone resin, the cost can be greatly reduced. For example, when combined with ethylene glycol, it can be made into polyester resin, and when bonded with glass cloth, it can be made into fiberglass.

Furfural resin and furfural plastic have extremely wide applications and extremely rich resources, and these resources have always been regarded as waste, which has great development prospects.

Can Oil Be Turned into Cloth?

Oil and cloth are completely different substances. Putting oil and cloth together, you can't see their commonalities at all. However, the chemical industry can turn oil into cloth, and very beautiful cloth, which can be used in industry or for clothing. However, the oil mentioned here does not refer to all oils for the time being, but refers to castor oil. Although castor oil is a high-yield crop, in the past, in addition to a little medicinal use, it was mainly used as lamp oil. Modern science had already gradually broadened its uses, but it was only the chemical industry that really made it stand out. It can be used to make synthetic fibers, turning oil into cloth.

Castor oil can also be made into sebacic acid and other chemical products through not complicated chemical processing. Sebacic acid is the basic raw material of the plastic plasticizer dibutyl sebacate, which is used in large quantities.

Rice Straw Also Has Great Uses

Various crop stalks, such as wheat straw, rice straw, soybean stalks, castor stalks, etc., can be used as raw materials for rayon and paper-making industries. And it can produce extremely cheap lignin plastic. Because it is cheap, when combined with other resins, it can be used in many aspects.

The above are just a few main aspects, far from including everything. In the utilization of agricultural products and by-products, comprehensive utilization has the greatest economic significance, and only in this way can the industry utilizing agricultural products and by-products be widely developed. As long as comprehensive utilization is carried out, almost all agricultural products and by-products can be said without exaggeration to be "full of treasures."

In the chemical industry, not only agricultural products and by-products have broad value, but it should actually be expanded to all plants. In all wild plants, oil, powder, sugar, alcohol, fiber, pesticides, medicines, fertilizers and other products can be obtained separately by chemical methods.

The reason why the road to developing the chemical industry in rural areas is particularly broad and the future is infinitely bright is not only because there are abundant agricultural resources and wild plant resources, but also that all agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries are treasures of the chemical industry.

Can We Open the Treasure Trove?

Do we have the ability to uncover the secrets of this treasure trove and can we serve our country's construction cause and people's welfare? The answer is yes.

For the utilization of agricultural products and by-products, most of the main products have been mastered by us technically. Although some technologies have not been fully mastered at present, they are being gradually resolved. Technically speaking, we have already obtained the key and can organize production.

Agricultural products and by-products as raw materials for the chemical industry are generally suitable for small-scale and decentralized production. Over-concentration and large-scale are not necessarily suitable in most cases. It is precisely because of this reason that it is impossible to widely use agricultural products and by-products to develop the chemical industry in capitalist countries. But in socialist China, it is completely different and can be greatly developed.

The Party's general line for building socialism has inspired the soaring enthusiasm of 600 million people, improved the people's degree of communist awareness, promoted the people's pioneering spirit, and formed a leaping situation in which the whole people are running industries. Practice has proved that the combination of large, medium and small, the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, the connection between centralized and decentralized, and the simultaneous advancement of urban and rural areas have opened up broad roads for realizing the policy of the whole people running industries. Of course, it also opens up roads for maximizing the use of decentralized agricultural products and by-products to develop the chemical industry.

After agricultural cooperatives developed into people's communes, the manpower, material resources, and financial resources have greatly increased compared to the period of agricultural cooperatives, the scope of resource utilization has also been greatly expanded, and the ability to comprehensively manage industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries has been greatly enhanced. Due to the development of production, the demand for chemical products will gradually increase. With objective possibilities and needs, and with correct methods, conditions have been created for comprehensively utilizing agricultural products and by-product resources to develop the chemical industry.

Now, the problem that needs to be solved is that we must take action immediately and work earnestly, then we can open the door to the treasure trove.

    打开百宝库
    化学工业部副部长　梁膺庸
    利用丰富的农产品及农业副产品大量生产化工产品，打破了过去单纯依靠矿物的范围，这就大大扩大了化学工业获得原料的领域。利用农产品及农业副产品大力发展化学工业，还有许多特点，其中最主要的是，第一、一般讲，所需设备简单，生产方法比较容易，建设费用较低。二、农产品及农业副产品，是永远用不尽的一种原料，因为它能年复一年地不断的生长，收了再种，种了再收，因此，它就会周而复始地给我们提供工业原料。三、我国的矿产资源是极丰富的，而且始终是化学工业的主要原料，这是毫无疑问的。但农产品的分布较之矿产资源更为普遍，被普遍利用的可能也就更大一点。
    那么，农产品及农业副产品，在化学工业中究竟可以搞些什么名堂呢？
          从红薯说起
    红薯和其他薯类（还有马铃薯、芋头等），是我国主要农产品之一，也是高产作物之一。如何有效地利用这样多的红薯，是一重要问题。
    红薯是很好的主食品和饲料。还可以加工成淀粉食用，淀粉可进一步加工为副食品、点心、药用和食用葡萄糖、乳酸、湿润剂、糊精、糖浆、山梨醇、甘露醇等等。淀粉和淀粉加工品，可以使用于一二百种工业，甚至可以做抗热胶和塑料、炸药等。现在仅就红薯在化学工业方面的最主要的用途作些说明。
    红薯可用发酵方法制得酒精、丙酮、丁醇、甘油、异戊醇酸等。丙酮、丁醇作有机溶剂，塑料增塑剂，在化学工业方面都有极广泛的用途，用量都较大，用其他方法远不如用红薯来的方便经济。酒精的用途则更为广泛，酒精是拖拉机、汽车很好的燃料，除可以作为防冻剂以外，在化学工业上更是一大宝，用酒精可以做出许多非常宝贵而为国民经济迫切需要的化工产品。其中最基本的有乙醛、醋酸、聚乙烯、氯乙烯、聚苯乙烯、氯乙醇、环氧乙烷、二氯乙烷、乙二醇、乙基苯、乙醚、各种酯类、丁二烯、丁纳橡胶、丁苯橡胶和聚硫橡胶等等基本原料、中间产品和成品。现在只就几种产品说明它们的用途。
    聚乙烯是一种绝缘性能极好的塑料，可以广泛用于电机和电器工业，这对我国迅速发展着的电力工业有重要意义。
    乙二醇是很好的防冻剂，又是合成纤维特丽纶的主要原料。乙二醇硝化后可以做矿山炸药。由于我们的建设规模大，速度快，明年将需要成百万吨的炸药才能满足矿山、铁道和水电站建设的需要。我国目前所生产的硝铵，远不能满足这个需要。因此，必须在增产硝铵的同时，尽可能多地生产乙二醇炸药。
    二氯乙烷，是一种很好的溶剂，又是很好的熏蒸杀虫剂，储备粮食的增加，对熏蒸剂需要也增加了，应适当组织生产。二氯乙烷又是重要杀菌剂代森锌的原料。经过二氯乙烷，又可以生产聚氯乙烯塑料和纤维。聚氯乙烯塑料用途非常广泛，但用电石做，则耗电量过大，所以它的发展在目前受到很大限制，用这种方法生产聚氯乙烯是比较经济的，在将来也可以同电石法并用。
    利用酒精，还可以生产多种合成橡胶，如丁钠、丁苯、聚硫橡胶等。我国国民经济的迅速发展，需要数量极大的橡胶原料。天然胶是重要来源之一，但是天然胶的发展，不论从时间和数量说，都远远不能满足需要，进口数量也有限度。因此，大力组织合成橡胶的生产，成为化学工业极重要的任务之一。根据我国目前资源情况，大力组织丁钠橡胶的生产，对于适应工业、农业、交通运输和人民生活的需要，是最现实的方案。当然随着苯的资源的逐步增多，也可以逐步增加丁苯橡胶的产量。
    乙烯这个重要的化工原料，世界各国差不多都是从石油废气中提取。我国则除了这个来源外，还可以从酒精中大量取得，这样，我们取得乙烯的路子就很宽阔了。
  稻谷壳、荞麦皮能值几文
    稻谷壳、荞麦皮、燕麦皮、棉籽壳、玉米芯、甘蔗渣、葵花籽皮、花生壳这些东西能值几文钱？这问题提得完全有道理。在过去，这些东西确是值不了几文钱，顶多可以烧烧火，喂喂牲口。虽不能说无用，用处也只如此。可是在化学工业发达的现今时代，情况变了，再不能小瞧这些东西了，它们已经是具有很高经济价值的物资，应该大大提高他们的身价。从这些东西当中，可以提出糠醛、酒精、醋酸、甲醇、木质素、活性炭等极多的化工产品。
    现在就以可提取的最大量的糠醛来说，根据实验研究证明，以下各种物资含糠醛量约为：燕麦皮、玉米芯19％—20％，棉籽壳17％—18％，甘蔗渣15％—17％，谷壳11％—12％。当然，按照目前技术条件，还不能全部提出，但是因为这些东西很多，只要回收率达到60％—70％，数量也就极可观的了，何况还是“废物”利用呢！除了提取糠醛以外，还可制得酒精、活性炭、醋酸等等。
    糠醛这个东西，究竟有些什么用处呢？根据化工部北京研究院提供的资料看，以糠醛为原料可以制造出种类很多的化工产品。目前大体可分为十个方面。在技术上比较成熟的，或者经过努力可以解决的有：1、尼龙66、尼龙6（即卡普隆）、尼龙7（即恩南特）；2、聚酯增强塑料；3、糠醇树脂塑料；4、糠醛丙酮树脂；5、乙烯呋喃树脂；6、乙烯呋喃同丁二烯共聚合成橡胶；7、人造血清；8、多种增塑剂；9、工业溶剂；10、农药、杀虫剂、防腐剂等。
    假定今明两年能利用以上各种资源共制得十万吨糠醛，利用这些糠醛做成合成纤维，约可满足六百四十万套飞机轮胎和大型轮胎帘子布和帘线的需要，用合成纤维装配的轮胎，寿命可延长一倍左右。如果用十万吨糠醛全部做成聚酯树脂塑料，可以制造二百万辆小汽车的车身。这只是说明它的经济价值，事实上并没有必要完全来做这些东西。这种塑料还可以广泛运用在工业、交通业，在农村中也大有它的用武之地。由于这种塑料比酚醛塑料具有更高的耐碱、耐温性能，又比较便宜，因此，可以用作各种反应器、贮罐的衬里，可以制成各种工业用管件。我国木材的成材率一般较低，大量的碎木、木屑未能利用，如广泛应用糠醛树脂作粘合剂，则可大大提高利用率。在农村中，大规模改造农村住宅、增建房屋的高潮，不久将要出现，木材的供应必然会感到严重不足。糠醇塑料，则可大量代用木材制造门窗，可以装备住宅及民用用具，制成增强塑料，还可用作承重的房屋构件、梁柱和车辆、农具的主件或配件。如果把这种树脂再和其他树脂配合使用，其用途将更广泛，比如环氧树脂，在工业和国防上都有极重要的用途，但价格太贵，如同糠醛丙酮树脂配合使用，则可大大降低成本。再如同乙二醇配合可制成聚酯树脂，同玻璃布粘合又可制成玻璃钢。
    糠醛树脂和糠醛塑料，既有极广泛的用途，所需资源又极丰富，而这些资源一向被当成废料看待，这就具备了大大发展的前途。
      油能不能变成布
    油和布是完全不同的物质，把油和布放在一块，一点也看不到它们的共同点。可是，化学工业却可以把油变成布匹，而且是非常美丽的布，可以用于工业，也可用于穿用，不过，现在所说的油，暂时还不是指一切油，这里是指蓖麻子油。蓖麻子油虽是高产作物，可是在过去除了医药用一点外，主要用作灯油。近代科学本来已经使它的用途逐渐广泛起来，可是只有化学工业，才使它真正大出风头，用它可以制成合成纤维，把油变成布。
    蓖麻子油经过并不复杂的化学加工，还可制得癸二酸及其他化工产品。癸二酸是塑料增塑剂癸二酸二丁脂的基本原料，用量很大。
      稻草用处也很大
    各种农作物秆茎，如麦秆、稻草、大豆秆、蓖麻子秆等等，都可作为人造丝和造纸工业的原料。并可以生产极廉价的木质素塑料。因为它便宜，同其他树脂配合起来，可使用于许多方面。
    以上只是提出几个主要方面，远不能包括一切。在利用农产品和农业副产品中，综合利用具有最大的经济意义，也只有这样，利用农产品和农业副产品的工业才能广泛发展。只要综合利用，几乎一切农产品及农业副产品，都可以毫不夸大地说“混身都是宝”。
    在化学工业上有广泛的价值的，不止农产品及农业副产品，其实应该扩大到一切植物。在一切野生植物中，用化学方法都可以分别取得油、粉、糖、酒、纤维、农药、药品、肥料等产品。
    在农村中发展化学工业的道路之所以特别广阔，前途之所以无限远大，不只是因为有丰富的农产资源和野生植物资源，而且所有农、林、牧、副、渔都是化学工业的宝库。
      能不能打开百宝库
    我们有没有能力揭开这个宝库的秘密，能不能为我国的建设事业和人民福利服务呢？答案是能。
    对于农产品及农业副产品的利用，其中大多数的主要产品，在技术上已经被我们掌握了，有些技术虽然在目前还未被完全掌握，也正在逐步解决中。从技术上说来，我们已经拿到钥匙，可以组织生产。
    农产品及农业副产品作为化学工业原料，组织工业生产，一般说宜于小规模和分散进行，过分集中、规模过大，在多数情况下是未必相宜的。正因为这种缘故，在资本主义国家中广泛地利用农产品和农业副产品发展化学工业就不大可能。但是在社会主义的我国，则完全不同，可以大大发展。
    党的建设社会主义的总路线，鼓起了六亿人民的冲天干劲，提高了人民的共产主义觉悟程度，发扬了人民的首创精神，形成全民办工业的跃进局面。实践证明，大中小结合，土洋并举，集中与分散相联系，城乡并进等办法，为实现全民办工业的方针开拓了广阔的道路。当然，也为最大限度地利用分散的农产品和农业副产品发展化学工业开拓了道路。
    农业合作社发展成为人民公社之后，人力物力财力比之于农业合作社时期都有很大的增长，利用资源的范围也较前大为扩大，综合经营工农牧副渔等事业的能力大为增强。由于生产的发展，对化工产品的需要，也将逐步增加。客观上有可能和需要，又有正确的办法，就为综合利用农产品和农业副产资源发展化学工业创造了条件。
    现在，所需要解决的问题，就是我们必须立即行动起来，认真进行工作，就可以打开宝库之门。
