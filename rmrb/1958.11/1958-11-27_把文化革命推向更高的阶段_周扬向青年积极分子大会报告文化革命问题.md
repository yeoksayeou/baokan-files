Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave a report on the issue of the Cultural Revolution today at the National Youth Socialist Construction Activist Congress.

	In his report, Zhou Yang first discussed the unprecedented comprehensive Great Leap Forward situation that has emerged across the country this year. He pointed out that the general line for socialist construction put forward by the Party correctly reflects the laws of our country's real development, reflects the aspirations and demands of millions of people, and has therefore greatly inspired the people of the whole country, greatly liberated their minds, and ensured that our country can build and complete socialism at the fastest speed. In the recent short period of several months, a movement for people's communes, a nationwide industrialization movement with steel as the key link, an education revolution combining education and productive labor, and a mass cultural movement have been launched across the country. These magnificent mass movements have greatly accelerated the speed of socialist construction in our country, and will thoroughly change the backward state of our culture and technology, preparing the material and spiritual conditions for our country's future transition to communism.

	Zhou Yang then focused on the important significance of the communist ideological liberation. He said that ideological liberation, daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, has become a prominent feature of the spiritual outlook of the people of our country today, and is also an important reason why our country has been able to achieve such great achievements on all fronts this year.

	Zhou Yang pointed out that the communist ideological liberation movement is the soul of the Cultural Revolution. The people are the creators of history and culture, but for thousands of years, the working people have been deprived of the right to enjoy these achievements. Bourgeois scholars and experts have treated knowledge and science as their own patents. But today, everyone can see that the working people have begun to become the masters of culture, science, and technology. Whether in culture, education, or science, the broad masses are breaking superstitions, liberating their minds, and showing a daring and innovative style. After describing the amazing achievements made by the working people in these areas, Zhou Yang pointed out that a new situation in the Cultural Revolution has already taken shape. The task before us is how, under the guidance of the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, to cooperate with economic development and advance the Cultural Revolution to a higher stage.

	Zhou Yang then talked about several issues in cultural and educational work in the future.

	He first pointed out: Our cultural and educational work must serve proletarian politics and socialist construction. If we deviate from this principle, we will make mistakes. What kind of economic base and political system there is, there is what kind of cultural and educational cause. Cultural and educational undertakings should cooperate with economic development. The material construction of cultural and educational undertakings should not exceed the scope permitted by economic conditions. However, the ideological content of culture must promote the communist spirit, fully reflect the communist elements that appear in people's lives, and express the communist style of advanced figures. In this way, culture can serve politics and exert a huge influence on the development of economy and politics and play a promoting role. Zhou Yang said that the basic task of the Cultural Revolution is mainly to "intellectualize workers and peasants, and proletarianize intellectuals," that is, to transform the old culture, eliminate the cultural backwardness left over from old China, and create a new communist culture.

	Zhou Yang then pointed out that cultural and educational work must adopt the mass line method and achieve a correct combination of popularization and improvement. We must rely on the strength of the masses themselves to mobilize the masses to run education and engage in culture. We must act in accordance with the needs and voluntary principles of the masses, and first meet the most urgent needs of the masses, so that the current needs and long-term needs are appropriately combined. He said: The most pressing task at present is to meet the cultural demands of the broad masses of workers and peasants, so we must first vigorously popularize education and popularize culture, but we must never neglect the work of improvement.

	Zhou Yang said that letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is a principle that we must always implement in cultural, scientific, and artistic work. The ideology and culture of the proletariat can only be truly tempered and healthily developed in the constant struggle with the ideology and culture of the bourgeoisie, and in the mutual competition and debate of various different styles and different opinions. Our pulling out white flags and planting red flags in the cultural field is precisely a huge achievement made by implementing the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. We should not forcibly and artificially eliminate the opposing side on the ideological front, but should not be afraid of establishing the opposing side, so as to make the truth clearer and clearer.

	Zhou Yang said that our young people have made outstanding achievements on all fronts of national construction. In the cultural revolution and the technical revolution, they have become a vibrant and unstoppable force. They have shown a courageous spirit of creation and criticism. This is most precious. He said that we must continue to break superstitions and liberate our minds. On the other hand, we must study diligently and practically. The most important thing is to learn in labor and struggle, but we cannot therefore despise the study of book knowledge and basic theory. We must combine revolutionary enthusiasm with a spirit of seeking truth, and combine the style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do with assiduous study.

	Comrade Zhou Yang finally said that as long as our generation of young people muster their energy, are not arrogant or impetuous, study diligently, and strive to learn, climbing the highest peak of science and culture is just around the corner. In their hands, miracles that predecessors could not have dreamed of will surely be made, and a new China with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture will be built.

    把文化革命推向更高的阶段
    周扬向青年积极分子大会报告文化革命问题
    新华社26日讯　中共中央宣传部副部长周扬，今天在全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上作了关于文化革命问题的报告。
    周扬在报告中首先谈到了今年在全国出现的历史上空前的全面大跃进的形势。他指出，党所提出的建设社会主义的总路线，正确地反映我国现实发展的规律，反映了千百万人民的愿望和要求，因而极大地鼓舞了全国人民，大大地解放了他们的思想，保证我国能以最快的速度来建设和建成社会主义。最近短短几个月的时间内，在全国范围内掀起了人民公社化运动、以钢为纲的全民办工业运动，教育和生产劳动相结合的教育革命和群众文化运动。这些规模壮阔的群众运动大大加快了我国社会主义建设的速度；并且将彻底改变我国文化技术落后的状况，为我国将来过渡到共产主义在物质和精神方面准备条件。
    周扬接着着重谈到了共产主义的思想解放的重要意义。他说，思想解放，敢想、敢说，敢做，已成为我国人民今天的精神面貌的一个显著的特点，也是今年我国各个战线上之所以能够取得这么重大成就的一个重要原因。
    周扬指出，共产主义思想解放运动，是文化革命的灵魂。人民群众是历史和文化的创造者，但是，几千年以来，劳动人民被剥夺了享受这些成果的权利。资产阶级学者专家把知识和科学当做了自己的专利品。而今天，大家可以看到，劳动人民已开始成为文化、科学、技术的主人，不管在文化、教育、科学方面，广大群众都在打破迷信，解放思想，表现出敢作敢为的风格。周扬在叙述了劳动人民在这些方面所取得的惊人成绩后指出，一个文化革命的新形势已经形成。摆在我们面前的任务就是如何在多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的指导下，配合经济的发展，把文化革命推进到一个更高的阶段。
    周扬接着谈到今后在文化教育工作中的几个问题。
    他首先指出：我们文化教育工作必须为无产阶级的政治服务，为社会主义建设服务，离开了这个原则，就要犯错误。有什么样的经济基础和政治制度，就有什么样的文化教育事业。文化教育事业应当配合经济的发展。文教事业的物质建设不应当超越经济条件所许可的范围。文化的思想内容却必须宣传共产主义精神，充分反映人民生活中出现的共产主义因素，表现先进人物的共产主义的风格，这样，文化才能为政治服务，给经济和政治的发展以巨大的影响和起促进的作用。周扬说，文化革命的基本任务，主要就是要使“工农群众知识化，知识分子劳动化”，就是要改造旧的文化，消灭旧中国所遗留下来的文化落后的现象，创造新的共产主义的文化。
    周扬接着指出，文化教育工作一定要采取群众路线的方法，要做到普及和提高正确地结合。必须依靠群众自己的力量，发动群众自己办教育，搞文化。必须按照群众需要和自愿的原则办事，首先必须满足群众最迫切的需要，使当前的需要和长远的需要适当结合起来。他说：当前最迫切的任务是满足广大工农群众的文化要求，因此首先必须大力普及教育和普及文化，但也决不能忽视提高的工作。
    周扬说，百花齐放，百家争鸣，是我们在文化、科学、艺术工作方面必须始终贯彻的方针。无产阶级的思想、文化只有在和资产阶级思想、文化的不断斗争中，在各种不同风格、不同见解的互相竞赛、互相辩论中，才能得到真正的锻炼和健康的发展。我们在文化领域中拔白旗、插红旗，正是实施百花齐放、百家争鸣的政策所取得的巨大成果。我们不要勉强地人为地取消思想战线上的对立面，而应不怕树立对立面，以便使真理愈辩愈明。
    周扬说，我们的青年在建设祖国的各个战线上都作出了出色的成绩，在文化革命、技术革命中，他们已成为一支生气勃勃、锐不可当的生力军。他们表现了勇敢的创造精神和批判精神。这是最值得宝贵的。他说，我们要继续破除迷信，解放思想，另一方面，又要踏踏实实地刻苦学习。最重要的是在劳动中、斗争中学习，但也不能因此轻视书本知识和基础理论的学习。必须把革命热忱与求实精神、把敢想敢说敢做的风格与刻苦钻研结合起来。
    周扬同志最后说，我们这一代青年，只要鼓足干劲，不骄不躁，刻苦钻研，努力学习，攀登科学文化的最高峰是指日可待的。在他们手中，一定会做出前人所梦想不到的奇迹，把一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的新中国建设起来。
