　　Furnaces Everywhere, Songs by Every Furnace:
　　Literary and Art Troops Serve Steel

　　(Our Newspaper) In response to the call from the Ministry of Culture to "seize the opportunity and mobilize all forces to serve steel," cultural departments in various regions have actively organized literary and art troops to go to the steel frontlines to conduct various literary and propaganda activities.

　　Under the slogan of "Wherever steel production goes, cultural activities go; whatever the central task is, that is what we promote," the literary and art troops are simultaneously making steel and carrying out propaganda, launching a high tide of deeply writing about steel, singing about steel, performing about steel, painting steel, and exhibiting steel. In Yu County, Shanxi Province, among the 90,000-strong steel army, a mass cultural and artistic force of over 10,000 people, including backbone members for creation, music, fine arts, and performance, has been organized. They are using exhibitions, performances, singing, slideshows, broadcasting, blackboards, Leap Forward platforms, Pointing-General platforms, red flags, and other forms to carry out activities on steel construction sites. Putian County, Fujian Province, moved 60% of its propaganda tools to the steel base, carrying out a variety of activities. The county's steel base has also universally established Red Flag Platforms (for launching satellites), Leap Forward Platforms (for comparing targets), Skills Competition Platforms (for comparing enthusiasm), and Hero Platforms (for praising advanced figures).

　　In order to better and more regularly carry out propaganda and mobilization work and recreational activities at the steel bases, various cultural and artistic organizations have also been established. For example, Feidong County, Anhui Province, has established 36 cultural centers (stations), over 330 clubs, over 150 performing arts troupes, and 460 mobile library stations (groups) at various steel bases throughout the county. In addition, there are 26 cultural vehicles, with a total of over 31,000 activists and cultural cadres. These organizations use forms that are popular with the masses to carry out propaganda and mobilization work and cultural and entertainment activities.

　　Various regions have organized mass cultural and artistic teams to conduct touring performances and outreach performances to steel construction sites. In Hubei Province, Xishui County organized 20,000 people to conduct performance activities at construction sites. Wan'an County, Jiangxi Province, organized 25 amateur theater troupes to conduct touring performances and outreach performances to steel bases. They performed over 300 shows of programs such as "For Steel," "Be Vigilant," "Absolutely Do Not Slacken," and "Vigorously Develop Steel," with an audience of over 180,000 people. In Xiangqin County, Shanxi Province, ninety-seven blind artists spent three days in the county compiling twenty propaganda pieces on steel, and each person learned to sing or recite one to several pieces, going to construction sites to perform folk art performances.

　　The literary and art troops in various regions have adopted the method of taking materials locally, setting off a creative high tide for serving steel. For example, Yu County, Henan Province, established more than 240 literary creation groups composed of steel fighters on steel construction sites throughout the county. In less than a month, these creative groups created more than 200,000 literary and artistic works in various forms, such as "Father and Son Heroes" and "By the Steel Furnace." At the Lianglukou steel construction site in Macheng County, Hubei Province, a one-poem-per-person movement was launched. In two days and one night, more than 530 steel fighters created 613 poems, with the participants accounting for 93% of all steel fighters. In Ruichang County, Jiangxi Province, over seven hundred workers at the Fan Zheng Steel Plant launched a furnace-front reading, writing, and singing campaign of "fighting for steel and writing poetry for steel" amidst intense labor. They established writing groups by furnace, adopting the method of "everyone writing, collective review, and everyone singing" to carry out activities. Currently, the factory has set off a high tide of "ten thousand articles," presenting a pleasant new atmosphere of "furnaces everywhere, songs by every furnace." (Zhang Xingman)

    漫山遍野是熔炉　处处炉边有歌声
    文艺大军为钢铁服务
    本报讯　为了响应文化部提出的“抓紧时机，动员一切力量为钢铁服务”的号召，各地文化部门都积极地组织文艺大军分赴钢铁前线进行各种文艺宣传活动。
    在“钢铁生产到哪里，文化活动到哪里；中心任务是什么，就宣传什么”的口号下，文艺大军边炼钢铁、边宣传，展开了深入地写钢铁、唱钢铁、演钢铁、画钢铁、展览钢铁的高潮。山西省盂县在九万人的钢铁大军中，组织了一支万人以上的包括创作、音乐、美术、表演等骨干的群众文化艺术队伍。他们在钢铁工地上运用展览、表演、歌唱、幻灯、广播、黑板报、跃进台、点将台、红旗等等形式展开了活动。福建省莆田县把60％的宣传工具搬上钢铁基地，进行了多种多样的活动。该县钢铁基地还普遍建立了红旗台（放卫星）、跃进台（比指标）、比武台（比干劲）、英雄台（表扬先进人物）等。
    各地为了更好地、经常地开展钢铁基地的宣传鼓动工作和文娱活动，还建立了各种文化艺术组织。如安徽省肥东县在全县各个钢铁基地建立了文化馆（站）三十六个、俱乐部三百三十多个、文工团一百五十多个、图书流动站（组）四百六十个，另有文化车二十六台，共有活动分子和文化干部三万一千多人。这些组织运用群众所喜闻乐见的形式，开展宣传鼓动工作和文化娱乐活动。
    各地组织了群众性的文化艺术队伍到钢铁工地进行巡回演出和慰问演出。湖北省浠水县就组织了两万人，到工地进行演出活动。江西省万安县组织了二十五个业余剧团，分赴钢铁基地进行巡回演出和慰问演出。他们演出了“为了钢铁”“警惕”“决不能松劲”“大搞钢铁”等节目三百多场，观众达十八万余人次。山西省襄沁县九十七名盲艺人在县集中三天编写了宣传钢铁的作品二十件，每人学会说唱一至数篇，分赴工地进行曲艺演出。
    各地的文艺大军，采取了就地取材的方法，掀起了为钢铁服务的创作高潮。如河南省禹县就在全县钢铁工地上建立了二百四十多个由钢铁战士组成的文艺创作组。这些创作组不到一个月的时间，就创作出“父子英雄”、“炼钢炉边”和各种形式的文艺作品达二十万件以上。湖北省麻城县两路口钢铁工地还开展了一人一篇诗运动，五百三十多名钢铁战士在两天一夜的工夫，就创作六百一十三篇，参加创作的人占全体钢铁战士的93％。江西省瑞昌县范正钢铁厂七百余名工人，在紧张的劳动中，开展了一个“为钢铁而战，为钢铁而写诗歌”的炉前读书、写作、唱歌运动。他们以炉为单位建立了写作组，采取“人人编、集体审、大家唱”的办法进行活动。目前，该厂已经掀起一个“文章千万篇”的高潮，呈现着“漫山遍野是熔炉，处处炉边有歌声”的愉快的新气象。　（张兴满）
