    The Republican Government's Prestige Swept Away
    Equivalent to the American People Bringing a Vote of No Confidence Against the Government

    The British "Daily Herald" wrote: "The American people are dissatisfied with the widespread lack of leadership in Washington. Just by talking to ordinary people on the street, you can understand that it is all this dissatisfaction that has caused the Eisenhower government's prestige to be swept away." The newspaper believes that if the Constitution did not stipulate that the presidential election would be held in 1960, the Republican Party would have already been ousted from the White House today.

    The Swedish trade union newspaper "Aftonbladet" said in an editorial on the 5th: "There is no doubt that in the past ten years, President Eisenhower's government has greatly lost face not only abroad but also in the eyes of the American people." "Aftonbladet" believes that Nolan's failure in California is "a blow to the pro-China lobby groups."

    Canadian political observers believe that the American election results are a serious failure for the Eisenhower government, the seriousness of which is equivalent to a vote of no confidence against the government.

    共和党政府威信扫地
    无异美国人民对政府提出不信任案
    英国的“每日先驱报”写道：“美国人民不满意华盛顿普遍缺乏领导。只要在大街上和普通老百姓交谈一下就可以了解到，正是这一切不满造成了艾森豪威尔政府的威信扫地”。该报认为，如果不是宪法规定在1960年才举行总统选举，那么共和党今天就已经被逐出白宫了。
    瑞典工会报纸“晚报”5日在社论中说：“毫无疑问，在过去十年中艾森豪威尔总统的政府不仅在国外，而且在美国人眼里大大地丢了脸。”“晚报”认为诺兰在加利福尼亚州的失败是“对院外援华集团的一个打击”。
    加拿大政治观察家认为，美国的选举结果是艾森豪威尔政府的严重失败，其严重程度等于对政府提出不信任案。
