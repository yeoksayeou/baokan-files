Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 28th: The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 27th, rejecting the Soviet proposal in its note to Western countries to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city.

According to Western news agencies, U.S. officials were "surprised" after the Soviet Union issued this note. They feared that the proposal would be "quite attractive to the world," especially in West Germany. The State Department studied the Soviet note throughout the day and issued its statement with Dulles' approval.

The State Department statement said, "The note will, of course, be carefully studied." It said that the U.S. government would also consult with Britain, France, West Germany, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on the note. The statement said that the Soviet Union seemed to be suggesting that the Western three powers "abandon their rights in West Berlin and withdraw from West Berlin" in order to establish a free city.

The statement expressed its inability to accept the Soviet proposal. It emphasized that the United States would not "conclude any agreement" with the Soviet Union to eliminate the occupation status of Berlin. The statement defended this attitude by saying, "There are some fundamental considerations that must be kept firmly in mind when we study the Soviet note," and that "the United States, together with Britain and France, has a solemn obligation to guarantee the security of the Western sectors of Berlin."

The statement disregarded the fact that the Western countries had grossly violated the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement and had forfeited their right to continue occupying West Berlin. The statement threatened that "the United States will not acquiesce in any unilateral abandonment by the Soviet Union of the obligations and responsibilities it formally agreed to with Britain, France, and the United States on the Berlin issue."

    美国国务院无理拒绝苏联建议
    竟说不同苏联缔结任何协议消除柏林占领地位
    新华社28日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院27日发表声明，表示拒绝苏联在给西方国家的照会中提出的关于把西柏林变成非军事的自由城市的建议。
    据西方通讯社报道，在苏联发出这个照会以后，美国官员感到“惊讶”，他们担心这个建议“对世界有相当大的吸引力”、特别是在西德。国务院对苏联的照会进行了一整天的研究，并且在杜勒斯的认可下发表了它的声明。
    国务院声明说，“对于（苏联）这个照会当然要进行仔细研究。”它说，美国政府还将就这一个照会同英国、法国、西德和北大西洋集团组织进行磋商。声明说，看来苏联是建议西方三国“放弃它们在西柏林的权利，从西柏林撤退”，以便建立自由城市。
    声明表示不能接受苏联的建议。它强调，美国不会同苏联“缔结任何协议”来消除柏林的占领地位。声明为这个态度辩护说，“这里有一些根本的考虑，在我们研究苏联的照会时必须牢牢地记住”，“美国同英国和法国一起负有保证柏林西区的安全的庄严义务”。
    声明无视这样一个事实，就是西方国家粗暴地破坏了波茨坦协定的规定，并且丧失了它们继续占领西柏林的权利。声明扬言，“美国将不会默许苏联单方面放弃它同英国，法国和美国一道就柏林问题正式商定的义务和责任。”
