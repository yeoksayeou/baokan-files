    A Large Potash Fertilizer Plant Built on Salt Lake
    (Our dispatch from Xining, November 26th) A large potash fertilizer plant – the Charkhan Potash Fertilizer Plant – has recently been built on the Charkhan Salt Lake in the Qaidam Basin, Qinghai Province. During the production preparation period, this plant trial-produced more than two hundred tons of potash fertilizer, the quality of which was very good, with a potassium content reaching over 55%.
    The Charkhan Salt Lake is located in the center of the Qaidam Basin, covering an area of more than 1,600 square kilometers. Because the lake water contains extremely high salt content, the salt lake has formed a thick and solid salt crust. This factory is built on the salt crust in the lake. Three hundred and eighty mobile houses, various tents, and several houses built of salt blocks are connected into a large area; at night, electric lights shine brightly. Four months ago, this place was still uninhabited; today, it is like a small lakeside city.
    The Charkhan Salt Lake has an inexhaustible supply of raw materials for making potash fertilizer – carnallite ore containing a large amount of potassium salt and some sodium salt and magnesium salt. Workers pry open the salt crust with iron bars, dig out the ore, and agitate it in water. The sodium salt then sinks to the bottom of the water, the magnesium salt dissolves, and the potassium salt is suspended in the water. The water is clarified, the precipitate is taken out, pressed, filtered, and dried, and what remains is potash fertilizer of very good quality. Next year, this plant can produce 200,000 tons of potash fertilizer.

### 盐湖上建成大钾肥厂

    盐湖上建成大钾肥厂
    本报西宁26日电　青海省柴达木盆地的察尔汗盐湖上，最近建成一座大型的钾肥厂——察尔汗钾肥厂。这个厂在生产准备期间，就试制出两百多吨钾肥，质量很好，含钾量达到55％以上。
    察尔汗盐湖在柴达木盆地的中心，面积有一千六百多平方公里。由于湖水含盐分极多，盐湖结成了一层厚而坚实的盐盖。这个工厂就建筑在湖中的盐盖上，三百八十座活动房屋、各式各样的帐蓬和几栋用盐块砌成的房子连成一大片；入夜，电灯照耀通明。四个月以前，这里还荒无人烟，今天，俨然是一座小型湖上城市了。
    察尔汗盐湖有着取之不尽的制造钾肥的原料——包含大量钾盐和一些钠盐、镁盐的光卤石矿。工人们用铁钎把盐盖撬开，挖取矿石，放在水中振荡，钠盐便沉到水底，镁盐溶化，而钾盐悬浮在水中。把水澄清，取出沉淀物压滤、晾干，便是质量很好的钾肥。明年这个厂可生产钾肥二十万吨。
