Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th - The first plenary session of the Third Shanghai Municipal People's Committee was held on the 17th. Mayor Ke Qingshi proposed at the meeting that Shanghai should be built into one of the most advanced cities in the world in terms of production, culture, science, and art, so that the lives of the broad masses of people will become increasingly better and more comfortable.

At the meeting, Ke Qingshi put forward the guiding principles and tasks for Shanghai's future construction and transformation. He said that Shanghai's future industrial construction should develop in the direction of high-level, large-scale, and precision industries, and culture and education, science and art should also develop in a more advanced direction. Although these aspects have achieved many achievements in the past few years, we cannot be complacent. Shanghai's large-scale heavy industry is very insufficient, and many products cannot be produced; although precision industry has some foundation, it is obviously not suitable for future development; although light industry has made progress, it cannot be satisfied; there are still many gaps in the chemical industry. This requires vigorous construction and improvement. On the other hand, due to the development of construction undertakings throughout the country, some general industries in Shanghai must be well reorganized. At the same time, Shanghai is also responsible for supporting the construction of various parts of the country with manpower and material resources in stages and batches; this work must be carried out in a planned manner, and some chaotic situations in which various places recruit personnel in Shanghai should be stopped.

Ke Qingshi pointed out: Every new measure we take to build and transform Shanghai will make the lives of the broad masses of working people better and more comfortable. For example, Shanghai will gradually build new houses and renovate old houses, and completely change the historical situation where many people live in attics and shantytowns. The new houses are not only three- and four-story buildings, but also take into account the living needs of men, women, old and young, and family reunions, and there must be resting places in front of the houses. The whole of Shanghai will be built into a beautiful garden city. Ke Qingshi said: Due to historical reasons, the living standards of Shanghai people vary greatly, and some even differ greatly. The traces left by this unreasonable capitalist distribution system cannot be completely eliminated all at once. Our task is first to gradually improve the lives of the working people based on the development of production, so that the living standards of the entire society will gradually increase and gradually approach.

Regarding the establishment of people's communes in cities, Ke Qingshi said: The establishment of people's communes in cities is definitely going to happen, but cities are different from rural areas, and the situation in Shanghai is more complicated, and specific methods need to be studied. At present, some neighborhood organizations are organizing residents to participate in production and run nurseries and public canteens. This is a pilot project to create conditions for the establishment of urban people's communes, which plays a great role in liberating women's labor force and organizing them to participate in work and production.

Ke Qingshi said: Completing the tasks of construction and transformation in Shanghai is very difficult and will not be accomplished in one or two years; we should take a positive attitude and realize it step by step.

At the meeting, the committee members expressed their opinions one after another, unanimously supporting the principles and tasks for the construction and transformation of Shanghai proposed by Mayor Ke Qingshi, and expressed their intention to implement them in their actual work.

    让人民的生活越来越美好越舒畅
    建设上海成为美丽的花园城市
    柯庆施提出上海市今后建设和改造的方针任务
    新华社上海20日电　上海市第三届人民委员会17日举行第一次全体会议，柯庆施市长在会上提出，上海市今后要在生产、文化、科学、艺术等方面建设成为世界上最先进的城市之一，使广大人民的生活越来越美好、舒畅。
    柯庆施在会上提出了上海市今后建设和改造的方针与任务。他说，上海市今后的工业建设应该向高级的、大型的、精密的方向发展，文化教育、科学艺术也都要向更先进的方向发展。过去几年中这些方面虽然得到不少成就，但还不能自满。上海大型的重工业就很不够，许多产品还不能生产；精密工业虽然有些基础，但从今后发展来看，显然还不能适应；轻工业虽有进步，但也不能满足；化学工业还有许多空白点。这就需要大力进行建设和提高。在另一方面，由于全国各地建设事业的发展，上海某些一般的工业必须很好进行改组。同时，上海还担负着分期、分批以人力物力支援全国各地建设的任务；这项工作必须有计划地进行，现在各地在上海招收人员的某些混乱情况应该停止。
    柯庆施指出：我们为建设和改造上海市采取的每一个新措施，都会使广大劳动人民的生活过得更好、更舒畅。如上海将逐步新建住宅和改建旧住宅，把历史上遗留下来的许多人住搁楼和棚户的状况彻底改变。新住宅不仅是三层、四层楼的房屋，而且要考虑到适合男女老幼、一家团聚的居住需要，宅前还要有休息的场地，整个上海将建设成为一个美丽的花园城市。柯庆施说：由于历史原因造成上海人民生活水平高低不一，有的甚至相差很远，这种资本主义的不合理的分配制度遗留下来的痕迹，不是一下子可以完全消除的。我们的任务首先是根据生产发展的情况，逐步改善劳动人民的生活，使整个社会的生活水平逐步提高，逐步接近。
    对城市建立人民公社问题，柯庆施说：城市人民公社是肯定要建立的，但城市与农村不同，上海的情况也比较复杂，具体作法还要研究。目前有些里弄组织居民参加生产和办托儿所、公共食堂，是试办性质，为建立城市人民公社创造条件，它对解放妇女劳动力，组织她们参加工作、生产，有很大作用。
    柯庆施说：完成上海的建设和改造任务，是很艰巨的，不是一年二年的事；应该采取积极的态度，一步一步去实现。
    会上，委员们纷纷发表意见，一致拥护柯庆施市长提出的建设和改造上海市的方针、任务，并表示要把它贯彻到实际工作中去。
