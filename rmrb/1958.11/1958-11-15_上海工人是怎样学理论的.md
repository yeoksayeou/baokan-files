    Chop Down the Poisonous Weeds, Let the Fresh Flowers Bloom

    The strong desire of the working people of Shanghai to consciously study Marxist-Leninist philosophy has long been evident. The experience of the anti-Rightist struggle made them feel that it was necessary to study theory in order to fight against the enemy. After liberation, people were educated by the Party. This education gave people an enlightenment: to thoroughly understand the truth of the revolution, to continuously improve their consciousness, and to be able to consciously guide the objective situation forward, in addition to actively participating in the actual struggle, it is also necessary to transform and improve their ideological understanding through theoretical study. Moreover, as Comrade Ma Shiting (a non-detached worker), the secretary of the Party branch of the repair workshop of the Qiuxin Factory, and Comrade Lu Shunchang (a metalworker), the propaganda committee member, keenly felt, it is necessary to study theory in order to answer some questions raised by the workers daily. On this truly conscious basis, the five-person philosophy study group in the repair workshop of the Shanghai Qiuxin Factory spontaneously organized in March of this year. They broke through the mysterious notion that "crude people" cannot learn theory, and after a period of exploration, gained experience.

    This first workers' philosophy study group in Shanghai played a significant leading role in the urgent demand of the basic masses of Shanghai to learn theory. Philosophy and theory study groups were successively established in factories throughout the city. Now, these groups have been combined with the movement of everyone studying Chairman Mao's works, vigorously engaging in the cultural revolution, and running spare-time schools, with the establishment of philosophy departments, philosophy classes, and social science lectures in various spare-time schools. The organizational form of the Qiuxin Factory's study group has long developed from a five-person group to a study class of more than 400 people, and now a philosophy research class and a shipbuilding specialized school have been established. The study of shop assistants in Shanghai has developed from the city's No. 1 Department Store to various state-owned stores. Farmers in the suburbs have also begun to study philosophy.

    Learning Theory, Promoting Production

    The recent situation of the basic masses in Shanghai learning theory illustrates the following issues:

    1. With the deepening development of the socialist revolution, the demand of the Party's basic masses for Marxist-Leninist theory has become more urgent. In the early stage of the socialist revolution, the three major transformations were carried out to solve the issue of economic ownership. During this period, the contradictions between the individual and the collective, and the contradiction between the ideology of the bourgeois superstructure and the socialist economic base were not fully exposed. The rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle fully exposed this contradiction. Among them, in addition to the antagonistic contradiction between the Rightists and us, more situations belonged to the contradiction between the individualistic old viewpoints and the new social foundation, that is, the contradiction within the people. Comrade Mao Zedong timely raised the issue of correctly handling the contradictions among the people, educating the people of the whole country. The victory of the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement laid the foundation for the great ideological liberation of the entire people. Evil spirits were swept away, the contradiction between individualistic old viewpoints and the new social foundation was overcome, and under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism, a new situation of the Great Leap Forward in production emerged. All of this prompted the masses' level of consciousness to rise to a new stage: they felt that it was impossible not to study revolutionary theory. Zhu Youdi, the leader of the study group of the Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Mill, said: "We must be more hardworking than ordinary people, and still have meetings and study culture, but theory must also be studied. If there is no time, we will squeeze it out." They consciously formulated a study system and consciously adhered to learning.

    2. Revolutionary theory comes from practice, and in turn, theory guides practice and promotes production. In the process of the working people of Shanghai learning theory, almost every study has proven this truth. The workers' study group of the Shanghai Machine Factory, after understanding that not only is believing in ghosts and gods superstition, but anything that believes in things that do not actually exist is called superstition, then linked it to blindly believing in engineers, technicians, and many things said in foreign books. After breaking down superstition, the pipe that was originally said to be indispensable in the water pump (the factory's main product) was also omitted, and the tools on the boring machine were also innovated. When they discussed objective laws and subjectivism, they examined that: scrapped machine tools can still be used after repair; the leadership's concerns about raising production quotas for fear that the masses would not understand are also subjectivist, because the quotas requested by the masses are even higher than those proposed by the leadership. When the philosophy class of the Dongjiao District Agricultural University learned about the errors of empiricism, the deputy director of the cooperative (non-detached) after examining the old experience of being satisfied with applying 50 piculs of fertilizer per mu and producing 120 piculs per mu of tomatoes, pursued more manure, raised the tomato shed by one layer, and demanded a yield of 300 piculs per mu. When the Qiuxin Factory's study group studied that internal causes are the basis and external causes are the conditions, they compared and studied the Wang Yuanyuan group (production group), which often could not complete its tasks, with the Tang Acai group, which could complete its tasks under the same conditions, and found that the former lacked effective production methods and ideological work and did not give prominence to politics, so they tried to prescribe the right medicine and improve productivity. Such examples are common in the learning process of the working people. It fully proves that: once revolutionary theory is grasped by the workers, it can directly promote production; once revolutionary theory is combined with the practice of the masses, the two become mutually cause and effect, and promote each other.

    The Quality of Learning Does Not Depend on Educational Level

    3. Revolutionary theory can be learned by everyone, but Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong's works have a strong class character, so only those who sincerely want revolution and have practical experience in class struggle and production struggle can learn well and use it correctly. The theory of cultural conditions is wrong. When many people talk about theoretical study, they always first consider the educational level, thinking that only a higher educational level can learn theory. However, the practical experience of the working people of Shanghai in learning theory proves that: to study revolutionary theory, cultural conditions are not the main thing, but practical experience in class struggle and production struggle is indispensable. Among the 11 groups and more than 250 people in the No. 3 Cotton Mill, 62.3% have a primary school education level, 3% are illiterate (before literacy campaigns), and the rest have a secondary school education. According to the experience of the Qiuxin Factory, whether one learns well or not does not depend on the level of education, but on whether one has practical experience in revolution and construction. Among them, there are three secondary technical school graduates, whose education level is higher than that of ordinary workers, but they do not learn as well as other workers. As for whether it is used correctly or not, it is even less determined by the level of education, but mainly determined by whether the standpoint, ideological consciousness, and learning attitude are correct or not. A certain culture is a condition for learning theory, but the lack of it does not mean that one cannot learn. Because the materials they study are "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "On Contradiction," "On Practice," the two "Historical Experiences of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" and "Red Flag," etc.; the way of learning is that those who can read read, and those who cannot read listen to others reading and explaining paragraph by paragraph, and participate in discussions through their own understanding.

    Having Taken a Tortuous Road

    4. A correct learning attitude determines a correct learning method. The working people are different from intellectuals. The working people's learning attitude is honest, modest and realistic. Intellectuals often become arrogant, treat the works and speeches of revolutionary teachers with a dubious attitude, or use a set of dogmatic and rigid formulas to scare and bind people. The five-person group of the Qiuxin Factory once took a tortuous road in the first month or so of the study period. At first, it started with the mechanical materialism of the 17th and 18th centuries. At that time, the masses reflected that philosophy "was like a ten-foot-tall gatekeeper in the City God Temple, unable to figure it out." Later, they became entangled in debates such as whether teacups and teapots were in motion, etc. At that time, the masses reflected that this did not solve any problems and was not very effective. After these two failures, through everyone's discussion, they got rid of the old formulas of dogmatism and found a way to learn from Mao Zedong's philosophical works as the main way to easily connect theory with practice, first learning "two types of contradictions," and then learning "On Contradiction," "On Practice," and the two "Historical Experiences of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat," etc. Therefore, everyone reflected: "What Chairman Mao said is what we do, which makes us feel close and easily guide us to combine with the current practical problems." This is very different from some intellectuals. The former have a "sense of intimacy" with Mao Zedong's works, while the latter believe that Mao Zedong's works are not worth learning as a theory. This is the dividing line between the correct and wrong learning attitudes, and also the dividing line of whether or not the policy of combining theory with practice can be correctly implemented.

    Connecting with Reality, Learning for Application

    One of their learning methods is to hold high the fighting banner of Marxism-Leninism, and simultaneously carry out criticism and self-criticism, promoting work and production through the transformation and improvement of people. When the study group of the Shanghai No. 1 Department Store discussed the issue of contradictions, they linked it to the contradiction between business and mass work, and used a comparison study between an advanced person—a female comrade, with many children, a salesperson and secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, who did well in both business and mass work, and a backward person—a male comrade, with light family burdens, unwilling to engage in mass work, often absent from meetings, and who did poorly in both business and mass work, and launched criticism, encouraged the advanced, and transformed the backward. When the philosophy group of the Qiuxin Factory repair workshop learned about the two worldviews in "On Contradiction," they linked it to the long-standing complaints in the workshop, discussed the issue of comprehensive viewpoints and one-sided viewpoints, and after the chairman of the workshop's trade union and the propaganda committee member of the Party branch took the lead in making self-criticisms, and linked it to the digging up and criticism of the class roots of subjective one-sidedness and the influence of the old society, the face of the workshop was changed. Yang Cheng, the deputy director of the workshop, overcame his bureaucratic style of "being laborious and not pleasing" after learning, and the masses praised him with big-character posters, saying that he now "knows what he is doing, and has learned Marxism-Leninism well." Such examples are everywhere, fully demonstrating the working people's straightforward and selfless excellent qualities, and their enthusiasm for learning revolutionary theory.

    Their second learning method is to accurately connect with the current situation, learn and apply simultaneously, and promote production. They neither drill into a dead end divorced from reality, nor talk glibly and superficially connect with reality. Their requirement is to use the method of accurately connecting with the current situation to understand the spiritual essence of the documents, both learning theory and understanding policies, and applying them to action. In the current situation, their every study has played a role in promoting the leap forward in production. After discussing and criticizing the thinking problems of "more cannot be good, good cannot be fast, and fast cannot be saved," the study group of the shipbuilding workshop of the Jiangnan Shipyard solved the problem of cooperation between work types and made the production capacity play a greater role under the original conditions. The 5,000-ton "Peace No. 28" was launched ahead of schedule. The dockyard cycle was only 83 days, which played a great role in promoting other shipyards as well. After August, under the call of the Municipal Party Committee for a further leap forward in the city, the Qiuxin Shipyard launched a movement to "shorten the shipbuilding cycle." Philosophical study seized the main contradiction at that time, and on the basis of past learning and criticism of subjectivist designs and unreasonable technological processes, through the exposure of clinging to conventions, mechanically copying, and book worship, the key to shortening the shipbuilding cycle was found. After solving the main contradiction problem, that is, the goal of shortening the shipbuilding cycle to 82 days was achieved, some comrades had a slack mood of "almost there." Philosophical study combined this situation and began to study the issue of "is there a bottom to the leap forward" from the perspective of the development of the dialectical materialist worldview in September, in order to ensure the continuous leap forward in production. The advanced nature of the working class determines that the working class's acceptance of Marxist-Leninist theory is much superior to that of bourgeois intellectuals.

    上海工人是怎样学理论的
    ?夫
        毒草锄掉，鲜花怒放
    上海市的劳动人民自觉地要求学习马克思列宁主义哲学理论的强烈愿望，早已有所表现，反右斗争的经验使他们感到为了对敌斗争非学习理论不可。解放后，人们受到了党的教育。这些教育给人以一种启示：要把革命的道理解透，要使自己的觉悟不断提高，而且能自觉地引导客观形势向前发展，除了必须积极参加实际斗争外，还必须通过理论学习改造和提高自己的思想认识。并且，正如求新厂修造车间的党支部书记马仕亭同志（不脱产的工人）和宣传委员陆顺昌同志（冷作工）所痛切感觉到的，为了解答工人同志日常提出的一些问题，也非学习理论不可。在这种真正自觉的基础之上，上海求新厂修造车间哲学学习五人小组就在今年3月自发地组织起来了。他们冲破了“老粗”不能学理论的神秘观念，经过一段时间摸索，取得了经验。
    上海市的这个第一个工人哲学学习小组，对上海市基本群众迫切要求学习理论的带头作用很大。全市各厂相继成立了哲学、理论学习组。现在，这些小组已与人人学习毛主席著作、大闹文化革命、大办业余学校的运动相结合，在各业余学校内设立了哲学系、哲学班和社会科学讲座等。求新厂的学习组织形式早已由五人小组发展到四百多人的学习班，现在已成立了哲学研究班和造船专科学校。上海市店员的学习已由市属第一百货公司发展到了各国营商店。郊区的农民也已开始学哲学。
    学习理论，推动生产
    最近时期上海基本群众学习理论的情况，说明了以下一些问题：
    1、随着社会主义革命的深入发展，党的基本群众对马克思列宁主义理论的需求也就愈为迫切。在社会主义革命的初期，进行三大改造，解决经济上的所有制问题。在这个时期，个人与集体的矛盾，资产阶级上层建筑的意识形态与社会主义的经济基础之间的矛盾，有些还未完全暴露出来。整风和反右斗争，使得这个矛盾得到了充分的暴露。其中除了右派分子与我们之间的敌我矛盾外，更多的情况是属于个人主义旧观点与新社会基础之间的也即人民内部的矛盾。毛泽东同志及时地提出了正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题，教育了全国人民。反右派斗争和整风运动的胜利，给全民思想大解放奠定了基础。邪气被扫除了，个人主义旧观点与新社会基础之间的矛盾得到了克服，以及在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀之下出现了生产大跃进的新形势，这一切都促使群众的觉悟水平提高到了一个新的阶段：自己觉得不学习革命的理论是不行的。上海国棉一厂的学习小组长朱有弟说：“我们一定比一般人辛苦些，照样要开会、学文化，但是理论也一定要学习，没时间，就挤。”她们自觉地订了学习制度，自觉地坚持学习。
    2、革命的理论来自实践，反转过来理论又指导实践，推动生产前进。在上海市劳动人民学习理论的过程中，差不多每一次学习都证明了这个真理。上海机器厂的工人学习小组在懂得了不仅相信鬼神是迷信，而且凡是相信实际不存在的东西都叫作迷信，接着就联系到盲目地迷信工程师、技术员以及外国书本上讲的许多事。在打破迷信后，水泵（该厂的主要产品）中原来说不可省的管子也省掉了，搪床上的工具也革新了。他们在讨论到客观规律与主观主义时，检查出：报废的机床，经过修理，还可以用；领导上对提高生产定额怕群众思想不通等等的顾虑也是主观主义的，因为群众要求的定额比领导上提出的还要高。东郊区农业大学哲学课学习到经验主义的错误时，合作社副主任（不脱产）在检查到番茄每亩上肥五十石亩产一百二十石就满足了的老经验以后，就追上厩肥，使番茄篷加高一层，要求亩产三百石。求新厂的学习组在学习内因是根据外因是条件时，将一个常常不能完成任务的王元元组（生产组）与另一个在同样条件下能完成任务的唐阿才组加以对比研究，找到了前者抓生产不得法及缺乏思想工作没有政治挂帅的内在原因，就设法对症下药提高了生产力。这样的事例在劳动人民的学习过程中是普遍存在的。它完全证明了：革命的理论一被劳动者掌握，就能直接促进生产；革命的理论与群众的实践一经结合，二者就互为因果，相互促进。
    学习的好坏不决定于文化水平
    3、革命的理论人人都可以学，但是，马克思列宁主义理论、毛泽东著作是有强烈的阶级性的，所以只有真诚愿意革命的、有阶级斗争和生产斗争实际经验的人才能学得好、用得对，唯文化条件论是错误的。不少人一谈起理论学习，总是先考虑文化水平，以为只有较高的文化水平才能学习理论。但是，上海市劳动人民学习理论的实践经验证明：学习革命的理论，文化条件不是主要的，实际的阶级斗争和生产斗争经验倒是不可缺少的。国棉三厂十一个小组，二百五十多人中，小学程度的占62.3％，文盲（扫盲前）占3％，其余的才是中学的程度。据求新厂的经验，学得好不好，不在于文化条件的高低，而在于有无革命和建设的实际斗争经验。他们那里有三个中技毕业生，文化程度比一般工人是较高的，但是他们还不如其他工人学得好。至于用得对不对，更不决定于文化水平的高低，而主要决定于立场、思想意识、学习态度的正确与否。一定的文化是学习理论的条件，但是缺乏它也不是不能学。因为他们学习的本子，都是“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”、“矛盾论”、“实践论”、两论“无产阶级专政的历史经验”和“红旗”等等；学习的方式，是能阅读者阅读，不能阅读者就听人家逐段念逐段讲，通过自己的领会，参加讨论。
        走过一段曲折的道路
    4、正确的学习态度决定正确的学习方法。劳动人民与知识分子不同，劳动人民的学习态度是老老实实、虚怀若谷和实事求是的。知识分子则往往自高自大，用疑难的态度对待革命导师的著作言论，或者用一套教条主义的死板公式吓唬人，束缚人。求新厂的五人小组，在开始的一个月左右的学习时间内，曾经走过了一段曲折的道路。起先是从十七、十八世纪的机械唯物论讲解起，那时群众反映：哲学“像城隍庙里守门的丈二金刚那样摸不着头脑”。其后又纠缠于如茶杯、茶壶是否在运动等的争论，那时群众又反映：这样不解决什么问题，收效不大。经过这两段的失败，通过大家议论，才走出了教条主义的旧公式，找到了以学习毛泽东哲学著作为主的便于理论联系实际的道路，先学习“两类矛盾”，再学习“矛盾论”、“实践论”和两论“无产阶级专政的历史经验”等等。于是大家反映：“毛主席讲的就是我们做的，使我们有亲切之感，容易引导我们结合当前的实际问题。”这与某些知识分子是大不相同的，前者对毛泽东著作有“亲切之感”，而后者却认为毛泽东的著作不值得他们当作理论来学习。这是正确的与错误的两种学习态度的分界线，也是能否正确地贯彻理论结合实际这一方针的分界线。
    联系实际，学以致用
    他们的学习方法之一，是高举马克思列宁主义的战斗旗帜，批判与自我批判同时并举，通过人的改造和提高促进工作和生产。上海市第一百货公司的学习小组在讨论矛盾问题时，联系到业务与群众工作的矛盾，用一个先进者——女同志，小孩多，营业员兼团支书，业务工作与群众工作都做得好，和另一个落后者——男同志，家务负担轻，不愿搞群众工作，开会老缺席，业务工作和群众工作都做得差的情形对比研究，展开了批评，鼓励了先进，改造了落后。求新厂修造车间哲学组学习到“矛盾论”中的两种宇宙观时，结合这个车间多年来的埋怨情绪，讨论了全面观点与片面观点问题，经过这个车间的工会主席和党支部宣传委员带头作自我检讨，并联系到主观片面性的阶级根源及旧社会影响的挖根批判，使这个车间的面貌得到改变。车间副主任杨诚经过学习克服了“吃力不讨好”的事务主义作风，群众就用大字报表扬他，说他现在“心中有数，马列主义学得好。”这样的事例到处皆是，充分表现了劳动人民直率无私的优良品质，和他们对学习革命理论的热心。
    他们的学习方法之二，是确切地联系当前的形势、边学边用、推动生产。他们既不脱离实际钻牛角尖，也不夸夸其谈，泛泛地联系实际。他们的要求，是用确切地联系当前形势的办法来体会文件的精神实质，既学到了理论，又领会了政策，并且用之于行动。在目前形势下，他们的每次学习都起到了推动生产跃进的作用。江南造船厂造船车间的学习小组在讨论批判了“多了不能好，好了不能快，快了不能省”的思想问题后，就解决了工种之间的协作问题，在原有的条件之下，使生产能力更多地发挥了作用。五千吨的“和平二十八号”提前下水了。船台周期只八十三天，这件事对其他船厂也起了很大的促进作用。8月以后在市委的全市跃进再跃进的号召之下，求新造船厂掀起了“缩短造船周期”的运动。哲学的学习就抓住当时的这个主要矛盾，在过去学习批判主观主义的设计和不合理的工艺过程的基础上，经过对墨守陈规、照搬照套的经验主义和教条主义的揭发，找到了缩短造船周期的关键。在解决了这个主要矛盾问题、即缩短造船周期到八十二天的指标实现了以后，有些同志又有“差不多”的松劲情绪。哲学学习又结合这种情况，在9月份开始以辩证唯物主义世界观的发展观点研究“跃进有没有底”的问题，以保证生产的不断跃进。工人阶级的先进性，决定了工人学习马克思列宁主义理论的接受程度，比之资产阶级知识分子要优越得多。
