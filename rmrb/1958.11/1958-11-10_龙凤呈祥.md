    Dragon and Phoenix Bring Prosperity
    Huang Fu
    "Dragon and Phoenix Bring Prosperity" is a Chinese auspicious saying. Now, foreigners who have come to China and witnessed the Great Leap Forward are also eagerly using auspicious words like "dragon" and "phoenix" to describe the new China.

    F. Ellis, a British commentator who visited China for three months, published his impressions of China after returning home, saying: "The red dragon of China is constantly leaping forward. It is truly astonishing that a country of farmers has become a country full of engineers and technicians overnight." He also said, "I have personally witnessed an unprecedented industrial revolution developing, and their achievements are very great on any level."

    F.A. Francis, the Labor Party Federal Chairman who just returned to Australia from China, published an article in the "Daily News," praising China's achievements, saying: "China is like a phoenix reborn from the ashes. In Anshan, there are nine modern open-hearth furnaces, and in the many factories in Shenyang, one now produces a most modern machine tool every forty-five minutes. For the first time in its history, the entire Chinese people have obtained sufficient food."

    One says China is a red dragon, and the other says China is a phoenix reborn. They use different metaphors to illustrate one fact: the Chinese people have stood up, are industrialized, and are strong. The era in which China's destiny was manipulated by Western imperialist countries is gone forever.

    The ruling groups in Western countries have a common characteristic in their view of China's Great Leap Forward: they are initially skeptical, then become paranoid. To put it bluntly, it is still fear that is at play. They are afraid that the Chinese people have stood up, and they are even more afraid that China's industry and agriculture are increasing production. Why are they so afraid? On the one hand, in the peaceful competition between two social systems, the senile bourgeoisie has lost the courage to compete. On the other hand, this fear is also a conditioned reflex out of class instinct. Because according to their own experience, increased production means competition for markets, and a strong country means launching aggression. Take two old-brand bourgeois newspapers as examples. The US "New York Post" reported on China on September 18, saying that the fierce rise of the East Wind "is cold and miserable for the West," while the London "Times" on September 6, in its report on China's bumper agricultural harvest, did not abandon its merchant nature, saying that if China and the Soviet Union slightly dumped a little surplus grain, the Western world's grain market would collapse! Their eyes can only see money, only see the market. They will never understand that a strong socialist country will never invade others, and that the increase in industrial and agricultural production in socialist countries is only to improve the lives of the people.

    I still like the saying "Dragon and Phoenix Bring Prosperity." Prosperity means harmony. The rise of the red dragon and the rebirth of the phoenix are both auspicious signs. China's strength indicates that world peace has a greater guarantee.

    龙凤呈祥
    黄复
    龙凤呈祥，是一句中国的吉利话，而现在，到中国来亲眼看到了中国大跃进的外国人，也争着用龙凤这一类吉利话来描绘新中国了。
    在中国访问了三个月的英国评论家F·艾理斯，回国之后发表中国观感说：“中国这条红色的巨龙，正在不断的向前跃进。一个农民的国家，一夜之间变成了一个到处是工程师和技术人员的国家，这实在不能不令人惊叹。”他还说：“我亲眼目睹了一次世界史上空前的工业革命正在向前发展，他们的成就，在任何一种水平上说，都是很伟大的。”
    才从中国回到澳大利亚的工党联邦主席F·A·弗朗西斯在“每日新闻”发表了一篇文章，盛赞中国的成就，他说：“中国像从灰烬里新生的凤凰。在鞍山有九个现代化的平炉，在沈阳的许许多多工厂中，有一家现在每四十五分钟就可以产生出一台最现代化的机床。全中国人民历史上第一次得到了充裕的粮食”。
    一个说中国是红色的龙，一个说中国是新生的凤，他们用不同的比喻说明了一个事实，中国人站起来了，工业化了，强大了，中国的命运一任西方帝国主义国家摆弄的时代，已经一去不复返了。
    西方国家的统治集团对于中国大跃进的看法有一个共同的特点，这就是他们始则将信将疑，继则疑神疑鬼，拆穿了说，还是一个怕字在作怪。中国人站起来，他们怕，中国工农业增产，他们更怕。为什么要这样怕？一方面说，在两种社会制度的和平竞赛中，老耄了的资产阶级已经失去了比一比、赛一赛的勇气，另一方面说，这种怕，也是一种出于阶级本能的条件反射。因为按照他们自己的经验，生产增长了就要争夺市场，国家强大了就要发动侵略。举两家老牌资产阶级报纸为例，美国“纽约邮报”9月18日关于中国的报导中说：东风的猛烈兴起，“对西方来说是寒冷而凄惨的”，而9月6日的伦敦“泰晤士报”则不脱商人本色，在报道了中国农业大丰收之后说，中国和苏联只要稍稍抛出一点余粮，西方世界的粮食市场就要瓦解！他们的眼睛只能看见金钱，只能看到市场，他们永远也不会理解，社会主义的强国绝对不会侵略他人，社会主义国家的工农业增产只是为了提高和改善人民的生活。
    我还是欢喜龙凤呈祥这一句话。祥者和也，赤龙兴起，凤凰再生，这都是祥和之兆，中国强大，这正表示着世界和平有了更大的保障。
