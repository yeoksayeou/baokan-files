Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, November 7th - Soviet aid has played a significant role in Romania's industrial development. Between 1944 and 1958, Romania received equipment from the Soviet Union worth 850 million rubles. In 1957 alone, Romania received equipment from the Soviet Union that could be used to build fifty-six enterprises.

To develop the chemical industry, Romania received a loan of 270 million rubles from the Soviet Union. Romania has also received substantial Soviet assistance in developing heavy industry. Between 1950 and 1958, Romania received 360 types of technical data related to heavy industry from the Soviet Union.

Between 1951 and 1957, 1,400 Romanian engineers and technicians were trained in the Soviet Union. Between 1955 and 1958, a total of 1,000 Romanian students graduated from Soviet universities. In addition, 150 experts received associate doctorates in the Soviet Union.

Romania has also received substantial assistance from the Soviet Union in the supply of raw materials. Between 1950 and 1956, Romania received 2 million tons of coke, 2.8 million tons of iron ore, 1.6 million tons of rolled steel, and 200,000 tons of cotton from the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, November 7th - Bulgaria's largest machine manufacturing plant, the Automobile and Tractor Parts Manufacturing Plant in Kolarovgrad, has been completed two months ahead of schedule. It is estimated that the factory will produce approximately 5,000 tons of automobile and tractor parts annually. Its completion is of great significance for further accelerating the development of Bulgarian agriculture.

The factory was designed, constructed, and installed under the guidance and assistance of Soviet experts. The factory's machinery and equipment were also provided by the Soviet Union. The completion of this factory is another symbol of the unbreakable friendship between the peoples of Bulgaria and the Soviet Union.

R. Damyanov, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, spoke at the ceremony held at the factory on the 5th to celebrate the start of production. He particularly emphasized that the fact that this factory went into production ahead of schedule vividly demonstrates the infinite creativity and enthusiasm of the Bulgarian working people and is a manifestation of the nationwide movement in Bulgaria to complete the Third Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

Currently, Bulgaria's machine manufacturing industry has about twenty-seven factories of various sizes. In addition to meeting domestic needs, Bulgaria also exports many industrial products such as lathes, drilling machines, combine harvesters, diesel engines, and water pumps, fundamentally changing the past situation of only exporting agricultural products.

    苏联帮助罗马尼亚发展工业
    保最大机器制造厂在苏联帮助下建成
    新华社布加勒斯特7日电　苏联的援助对罗马尼亚的工业发展起了很大的作用。在1944年到1958年期间，罗马尼亚就从苏联得到了价值八亿五千万卢布的设备。在1957年一年当中，罗马尼亚从苏联得到了可以建设五十六个企业的设备。
    为了发展化学工业，罗马尼亚从苏联得到了二亿七千万卢布的贷款。在发展重工业方面，罗马尼亚也得到了苏联的大量援助。在1950年到1958年期间，罗马尼亚从苏联得到了三百六十种重工业方面的技术资料。
    在1951年到1957年期间，罗马尼亚有一千四百名工程师和技术员是苏联培养出来的。在1955年到1958年期间，在苏联高等学校毕业的罗马尼亚留学生共有一千名之多。此外，还有一百五十名专家在苏联得到了副博士的学位。
    在供应原材料方面，罗马尼亚也从苏联得到了大量援助。在1950年到1956年期间，罗马尼亚从苏联得到了二百万吨焦炭，二百八十万吨铁矿石，一百六十万吨轧材，二十万吨棉花。
    新华社索非亚7日电　保加利亚全国最大的一个机器制造厂——科拉罗夫格勒市汽车和拖拉机零件制造厂比原计划提前两个月建成。预计，这个工厂每年生产的汽车和拖拉机零件约为五千吨。它的建成对进一步加速保加利亚农业的发展有很大意义。
    这个工厂从设计、施工到安装等都是在苏联专家指导和帮助下进行的。工厂的机器和设备也都是由苏联提供的。这个工厂的建成是标志着保苏两国人民之间牢不可破的友谊的又一象征。
    保共中央政治局委员、部长会议第一副主席拉·达米扬诺夫5日在这个工厂举行的庆祝开工生产的仪式上讲了话。他特别强调指出，这个工厂提前投入生产这一事实，鲜明地表现出保加利亚劳动人民的无穷的创造性和积极性，是保加利亚提前完成第三个五年计划的全民运动中的一个表现。
    目前，保加利亚机器制造业约拥有二十七个左右的大小工厂。除供应本国需要外，保加利亚还输出旋床、钻孔机、联合收割机、柴油机、抽水机等许多工业产品，根本改变了过去的只输出农产品的状况。（附图片）
