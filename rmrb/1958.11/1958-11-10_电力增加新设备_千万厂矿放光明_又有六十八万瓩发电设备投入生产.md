Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: China's power industry has recently added a new vital force: 680,000 kilowatts of large and medium-sized power generation equipment have been put into production in September and October. Coupled with the units installed before August, the nation's newly added power generation capacity this year has reached 1.2 million kilowatts, 80% more than the total newly added power generation equipment last year. In November and December alone, this equipment can generate more than 1.68 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity.

    Power shortage is one of the prominent problems that has emerged since the nationwide industrial production movement, with steel as the key link. To change this situation as soon as possible, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power more than doubled the number of power station construction projects added to this year's leap forward plan compared to the original plan set at the beginning of the year.

    One of the most difficult problems in power station construction this year is the lack of matching power generation equipment. To solve this problem, employees in various regions came up with many effective methods. The original power plants in various regions have also promoted the spirit of communist cooperation, transferring a large number of production standby equipment to support new plants.

    The fact that Party committees in various regions attach great importance to the construction of the power industry while focusing on steel production is also an important factor in accelerating power station construction. For example, in the power-deficient Northeast, most areas are led by provincial and municipal party secretaries who personally mobilize the masses, launching a mass campaign to run electricity. In October alone, the three provinces of Jilin, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang put 170,000 kilowatts of large and medium-sized power generation equipment into production, and also built thousands of small power stations.

### 电力增加新设备  千万厂矿放光明  又有六十八万瓩发电设备投入生产

    电力增加新设备  千万厂矿放光明
    又有六十八万瓩发电设备投入生产
    据新华社9日讯　我国电力工业最近又增加了一支生力军：有六十八万瓩的大中型发电设备在9、10月份先后投入生产。加上8月以前安装的机组，今年全国新增加的发电设备容量已达一百二十万瓩，比去年全年新增加的发电设备总和还多80％。这些设备在11、12两个月内，就可以生产出十六亿八千多度电。
    电力不足，这是全国开展以钢为纲的工业生产运动以后出现的突出问题之一。为了尽快地改变这种局面，水利电力部在安排今年跃进计划的时候，追加的电站建设项目比今年初原订的计划增加了一倍多。
    今年电站建设中最感困难的问题之一，是发电设备不配套。为了解决这一问题，各地职工想出了很多有效的办法。各地原有的发电厂也都发扬了共产主义的协作精神，抽调大批生产备用设备支援新厂。
    各地党委在抓紧钢铁生产的同时很重视电力工业建设，也是加快电站建设的重要因素。例如在缺电严重的东北，大部分地区都由省委和市委书记亲自挂帅发动群众，掀起全民办电高潮。仅10月一个月，吉林、辽宁、黑龙江三省就有十七万瓩的大中型发电设备投入生产，同时还建设了几千个小型电站。
