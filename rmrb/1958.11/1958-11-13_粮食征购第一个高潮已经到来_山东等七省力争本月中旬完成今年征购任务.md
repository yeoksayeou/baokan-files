The first upsurge of grain procurement has arrived.
Seven provinces, including Shandong, strive to complete this year's procurement task by mid-November.

This newspaper reports that the first upsurge of the nationwide grain crash procurement campaign has arrived. According to the Ministry of Food: recently, the amount of grain entering warehouses has risen sharply, with the amount entering warehouses in the first five days of November increasing by more than 50% compared to the same period last year. Henan Province, taking the lead in the first upsurge, had already overfulfilled its annual grain procurement task (excluding tubers) by the 9th, more than a month ahead of schedule. In Hunan, Shandong, Hebei and other provinces, the number of counties and cities that have completed and overfulfilled their grain procurement tasks has also accounted for about half of all counties and cities, with Hunan and Shandong having already completed more than 80% of their annual grain procurement tasks. Many prefectures and counties in Anhui, Heilongjiang, and Hubei provinces have also recently issued "satellites" that broke previous warehouse entry records. According to the arrangements of the above seven provinces already involved in the first upsurge, they will strive to basically complete this year's grain procurement work by mid-November.

Organizing upsurges in a planned, phased manner and launching "satellites" is a major feature of this year's grain procurement work. This year, steel and the "Three Autumns" [autumn harvesting, plowing and sowing] production are busy, and the grain procurement campaign must be carried out within the larger movement. After the rural communes were established, the state shifted from procuring grain from more than 700,000 agricultural cooperatives to more than 20,000 people's communes. The increased concentration and planning of procurement, coupled with the different situations of steel production and agricultural production seasons in various provinces and regions, provide sufficient conditions for organizing procurement and warehousing upsurges in a phased and batch-by-batch manner, seizing every opportunity. At present, the Ministry of Food has made preliminary arrangements based on the different situations of steel production and agricultural production seasons in various provinces, and the work arrangements of various provinces, that the country should have three warehousing upsurges. The first upsurge includes seven provinces, and it is required to generally end the three upsurges by mid-December, and basically end the grain procurement and warehousing work by the end of the year.

The several provinces currently in the midst of the procurement upsurge are mostly operating on a county-wide basis, with large-scale operations, organizing the launch of satellites, preparing for a few days, and making a sudden concentrated transport in one day. After the autumn harvest in Liaocheng Prefecture, Shandong, mostly ended at the end of last month, taking advantage of the labor force's rest, they immediately launched a grain procurement sprint week. In order to launch procurement "satellites," each county first debated whether or not "satellites" could be launched. A total of about one million big-character posters were put up in the district, criticizing the view that "large-scale movements cannot be carried out in conjunction with small-scale movements," and establishing the confidence to "launch satellites in a big way" and "strive for first place in the upsurge." Eighteen counties, including Liaocheng and Tangyi, mobilized more than 2.7 million laborers. Tangyi County alone mobilized more than 40,000 large and small vehicles. Due to sufficient preparation, most of them basically completed or overfulfilled the warehousing work in one or two days; some counties completed the task in at most two or three days, by making two concentrated efforts in one week. Suixian County, Henan Province, completed the procurement and warehousing work within a few hours due to good preparation. In organizing the concentrated warehousing, all localities also paid attention to safety and rest, and set up rest stations, tea stalls, and medical stations along the grain transportation routes.

The large-scale collaboration of financial and trade departments in various places, "grabbing everything when going to the countryside, and then dividing up the work after returning," is an important practice in organizing this year's grain procurement upsurge. Most of the prefectures and counties in Anhui, Hunan, Henan, Shandong, and other provinces have formed agricultural product procurement "teams" composed of financial and trade personnel, and some have even implemented "three unifications" – unified thinking, unified organization, and unified action. After changing the practice of separate procurement and each collecting one item to large-scale collaboration, the procurement progress of grain and other agricultural products has been greatly accelerated. As a result of the "three unifications" in Yanggu County, Shandong Province, thirteen agricultural product procurement and other financial and trade indicators have been completed ahead of schedule.

### 粮食征购第一个高潮已经到来  山东等七省力争本月中旬完成今年征购任务

    粮食征购第一个高潮已经到来
    山东等七省力争本月中旬完成今年征购任务
    本报讯　全国粮食突击征购运动的第一个高潮已经到来。据粮食部了解：最近粮食征购的入仓量急剧上升，11月头五天的入仓量比去年同期增加了50％以上。在第一个高潮中一马领先的河南省，到9日止，已经提前一个多月超额完成了全年粮食征购任务（不包括薯类）。湖南、山东、河北等省完成和超额完成粮食征购任务的县市也已经占到全部县市的一半左右，其中湖南和山东已经完成全年粮食征购任务的80％以上。安徽、黑龙江和湖北等省的许多专、县，最近也都先后发出了打破历年入仓纪录的“卫星”。据已经卷入第一个高潮的上述七省的安排，本月中旬将力争基本上完成今年的粮食征购工作。
    有计划地分期分批组织高潮、发射“卫星”，是今年粮食征购工作的重大特色。今年钢铁、三秋生产繁忙，粮食征购运动必须套在大运动中进行。农村公社化以后，国家由向七十多万个农业社征购粮食，转向两万多个人民公社征购。采购的集中性和计划性的加强，加上各省区钢铁生产情况和农业生产季节先后不同，这就为见缝扎针、分期分批组织征购入仓高潮提供了充分的条件。目前，粮食部已根据各省钢铁生产和农业生产季节先后不同的情况，和各省的工作安排，初步安排全国要有三个入仓高潮，第一个高潮包括七个省，要求在12月中旬大体结束三次高潮，年底基本结束粮食征购入库工作。
    目前正处在征购高潮中的几个省，大都是以县为单位，大兵团作战，组织放卫星，几天准备，一天突击运送。山东聊城专区上月底秋收大部分结束以后，趁劳力休整的机会，立即开展粮食征购突击周。各县为了放征购“卫星”，首先大辩论能不能放“卫星”，全区共贴出大字报约一百万张，批评了“大运动紧不能套小运动”的看法，树立了“大放卫星”，“高潮中争第一”的信心。聊城、堂邑等十八个县共出动二百七十多万劳动力，仅堂邑县出动的大、小车辆就有四万多部，由于准备充分，大都在一、两天内就基本完成或超额完成了入仓工作；有的县在一周内，分两次突击，至多也是两、三天就完成了。河南省睢县由于准备得好，几个小时之内就完成了征购入仓工作。在组织突击入仓中，各地还注意了安全和休息，送粮沿线设有休息站、茶水棚、医疗站等。
    各地财贸部门大协作，“下乡一把抓，回来再分家”，是今年组织粮食征购高潮的重要作法。安徽、湖南、河南、山东等省大部分专县都是把财贸队伍组成农产品采购“班子”，有的还实行“三统”——统一思想、统一组织、统一行动。把分头收购、各收一宗的作法改为大协作以后，粮食和其他农产品的采购进度都大大加快。山东省阳谷县“三统”的结果，十三项农产品收购和其他财贸指标都提前完成了。
