Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, November 23rd: Can silkworms be raised in winter? This question has been resolved in Zhejiang Province. The first batch of 40,000 silkworm egg sheets being raised as winter silkworms by people's communes across Zhejiang province are generally in their fifth instar. They are developing well and growing healthily. Some early winter silkworms have already begun to produce cocoons.

During the rearing process, commune members, with a spirit of daring to think and daring to act, researched many methods to solve the problems of insufficient mulberry leaves and feed, and poor insulation due to the cold weather in winter. Jiaxing, Jinhua, Ningbo and other regions have created a lot of experience in green storage of mulberry leaves, such as large tank storage, wine jar storage, house storage and other methods have been promoted. At the same time, various substitutes are also used to raise winter silkworms in various places. Jiangshan County has successfully tested 15 kinds of substitutes mixed in mulberry leaves, including corn leaves, soybean leaves, loofah leaves, potato leaves, and radish leaves.

    浙江各地试养冬蚕成功
    据新华社杭州23日电　冬季能不能养蚕？这个问题在浙江省已经解决了。现在浙江省各地人民公社第一次饲养的四万张蚕种的冬蚕，一般已处在五龄，发育良好，生长健康，有些早冬蚕已经开始产茧。
    在饲养中，社员们以敢想敢干的精神，研究出许多办法，解决了冬季桑叶少饲料不足和天气寒冷不好保温的问题。嘉兴、金华、宁波等地区都创造了很多青贮桑叶的经验，如大缸贮叶、酒坛贮叶、房屋贮叶等办法都得到推广。同时各地还采用各种代用品养冬蚕，江山县试验成功的掺在桑叶里的代用品就有玉米叶、夹豆叶、丝瓜叶、洋芋叶、萝卜菜叶等十五种。
