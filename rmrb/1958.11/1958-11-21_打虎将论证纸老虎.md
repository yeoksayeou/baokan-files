The Thinking of an Awakened People

    Chairman Mao's view of imperialism and all reactionaries is also the view of all awakened people, and it is not difficult to understand at all. I remember when I first joined the army during the War of Resistance Against Japan, I carried a red-tasseled spear, which was of course much worse than the weapons of the Japanese imperialist invading army, but we were not afraid. In 1941, the Japanese army carried out a major "mopping-up" operation with a very fierce arrogance. When I went home to see my mother, she asked me to go home, and I said to her: We must win, and the Japanese devils must fail. It was this spirit of certainty that encouraged me to go through that difficult period. And this kind of thinking was established for us by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

All Anti-People Guys are Not Scary

    The uprising of ethnic minorities in Ili, Xinjiang, in November 1941 also proved that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. At that time, the masses of all ethnic groups who participated in the uprising did not have much military knowledge, and their only weapons were hoes and wooden sticks, but they defeated the fully armed Kuomintang army and liberated the three districts of Yi (Ili), Ta (Cheng), and A (Altai). Despite the fact that the Kuomintang reactionaries later mobilized 30,000 troops to "encircle and suppress" them, they still suffered a shameful defeat. This shows that all anti-people guys are not scary, and only the power of the people is infinite and invincible.
    Cao Danuofu (Uyghur), Major General, Xinjiang Military Region

Only Through Resolute Struggle Can We Expose the Paper Tiger

    The fundamental way to deal with paper tigers is to struggle resolutely. Only through resolute struggle can we expose the essence of paper tigers and push the revolutionary movement to new victories. Chairman Mao said that reactionaries are stubborn but not solid, which means that the seemingly stubborn imperialism and reactionaries are actually very fragile and will soon turn into death. But this requires certain conditions, which is the struggle of the people. Without struggle, imperialism will not die on its own.
    How to struggle? This is to despise the enemy strategically, to regard the enemy as a paper tiger; but tactically, we must pay attention to the enemy and treat the enemy as an iron tiger. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: Imperialism is a paper tiger, but we must deal with it seriously.

Paper Tigers are Afraid of Tiger-Fighting Generals

    Before competing, the American invading army always thought that they were a tiger, and no one could touch them. But when we clashed with the American "ace" Marine Division 1, which had a long history of military building, at Huangcaoling in Korea, we saw through that it was just a paper tiger. In that battle, the American invading army had planes in the sky, tanks on the ground, and warships in the sea, attacking us for a day and a night, but in the end, they were beaten to a pulp by our rifles and grenades. It is true that paper tigers are afraid of tiger-fighting generals.

Treat Dead Tigers as Live Tigers

    Treat dead tigers as live tigers,
    Treat dead eagles as live eagles,
    Although American imperialism is a paper tiger,
    We cannot relax our guard against it.
    Want to fight?
    Then you have to fight hard!
    Soldier Wang Chuilu

Paper Tiger, Empty Inside

    I am not afraid of American devils,
    Rotten grass and wood are used as supports,
    A layer of paper is pasted on the outside,
    Two eyes are blind.
    Paper tiger, empty inside,
    One poke and there is a big hole.
    Soldier Zhang Yuxi

    打虎将论证纸老虎
    觉悟了的人民的思想
    毛主席对帝国主义和一切反动派的看法，也是一切觉悟了的人民自己的看法，一点也不难理解。记得抗日战争时期我刚刚当兵，扛的是红缨枪，和日本帝国主义侵略军的武器比起来当然很差，可是我们并不怕。1941年日本军进行大“扫荡”，气焰凶得很，我回家看望妈妈时，她叫我回家去，我对妈说：我们一定要胜利，日本鬼子一定要失败。就是这种必胜的思想鼓舞着我，走过了那个艰苦的年代。而这种思想也就是党中央和毛主席给我们树立起来的。

    一切反人民的家伙都不可怕
    1941年11月间，新疆少数民族人民在伊犁的起义，也证明帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。那时参加起义的各族群众没有多少军事常识，唯一的武器是锄头、木棒，但是他们却打败了全副武装的国民党军队，并且解放了伊（犁）、塔（城）、阿（勒泰）三区。尽管后来国民党反动派调集三万人马“围剿”，也仍然遭到可耻的失败。这说明一切反人民的家伙都不可怕，只有人民的力量才是无穷无尽而不可战胜的。
    新疆军区少将　曹达诺夫（维吾尔族）
    坚决斗争，才能戳穿纸老虎
    对待纸老虎的根本办法是坚决斗争。只有坚决地斗争，才能戳穿纸老虎的本质，把革命运动推向新的胜利。毛主席说反动派是顽而不固的，就是指看来颇为顽固的帝国主义和反动派，实际上非常脆弱，而且很快就会转化为死亡。但这要有一定的条件，这就是人民的斗争。不进行斗争，帝国主义是不会自行死亡的。
    如何斗争？这就是战略上藐视敌人，把敌人看成纸老虎；而战役、战术上则又要重视敌人，把敌人当铁老虎打。我们必须牢牢记取毛主席的教诲：帝国主义是纸老虎，但必须认真对付。
  　驻北京部队后勤部　高荣光
    纸老虎就怕打虎将
    在没有较量前，美国侵略军总以为他们自己是一只老虎，谁也摸不得。但是我们在朝鲜的黄草岭和有长期建军历史的美国“王牌”陆战一师一交锋，就看穿了它原来不过是只纸老虎。在那次战斗中，美国侵略军方面天上有飞机，地上有坦克，海里还有军舰，向我们进攻了一天一夜，可是结果却被我们的步枪、手榴弹打得头破血流。纸老虎就怕遇见打虎将，一点不假。
    某部二级战斗英雄一等功臣中尉　褚庆然
    死虎要当活虎打
    死虎要当活虎打，
    死鹰要当活鹰抓，
    美帝虽是纸老虎，
    但也不能放松它。
    要打么？
    就得狠狠地打！
    战士　王垂路
    纸老虎，里面空
    美国鬼子我不怕，
    烂草朽木作支架，
    外面糊上一层纸，
    两个眼睛一对瞎。
    纸老虎，里面空，
    一捅就是一个大窟窿。
    战士　张玉喜
