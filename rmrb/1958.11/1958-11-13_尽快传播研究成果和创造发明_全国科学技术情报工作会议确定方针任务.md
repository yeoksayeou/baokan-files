Xinhua News Agency, 12th. In order to adapt to the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the rapid development of scientific, cultural, and educational undertakings, the State Council’s Science Planning Commission and the State Technology Commission held a National Science and Technology Intelligence Work Conference in Beijing from November 1st to 12th to discuss further strengthening science and technology intelligence work, so that production and construction, scientific education, and other departments can obtain scientific and technical intelligence materials in a timely manner.

The meeting was presided over by Wu Heng, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council’s Science Planning Commission. Participants included responsible persons and representatives from the science work committees and planning committees of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, various central production and construction, cultural and educational departments, scientific institutions, and universities, totaling more than 350 people.

After the meeting concluded on the afternoon of the 12th, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the Science Planning Commission, Nie Rongzhen, received all the participants and gave them important instructions. Vice Premier Nie pointed out that scientific and technical intelligence work is urgently needed and should be launched as soon as possible to play a role in the great leap forward in industry and agriculture. Vice Premier Nie hoped that the participants would bring back the many scientific and technical materials exchanged at the meeting to various regions and make full use of them to maximize their effect. Finally, he encouraged those engaged in scientific and technical intelligence work to strengthen their focus on serving production and scientific research, and to do a good job in the collection, collation, and supply of scientific and technical materials. In their work, they should promote a communist style and strengthen mutual cooperation. In the cooperation between scientific and technical workers and units with inventions and creations, they should neither conceal their research achievements nor exaggerate them.

The meeting determined the tasks and guiding principles of scientific and technical intelligence work. The meeting considered that scientific and technical intelligence work must be based on the Party's general line for socialist construction and in accordance with the Party's technical policies. It must provide scientific and technical intelligence materials targeting the national production plan and scientific research plan, especially the central task of the current great leap forward in production. At the same time, it should pay early attention to inventions and creations and scientific discoveries that, although not urgently needed for current production, can open up new avenues for production; study the development trends of production and science and technology; and accumulate and systematically organize scientific and technical intelligence and materials in a step-by-step and planned manner. The meeting considered that scientific and technical intelligence work must be done extensively, rapidly, and accurately.

The meeting decided to establish a national network of scientific and technical intelligence that is interconnected, implement the mass line under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, organize and coordinate the forces engaged in scientific and technical intelligence work in all aspects, and establish full-time scientific and technical intelligence agencies in the organs in charge of scientific and technical work and production in various regions and in the central professional departments. Part-time or full-time scientific and technical intelligence groups or intelligence officers should be set up in grassroots units, so that inventions, creations, research achievements, and advanced experiences in science and technology at home and abroad can be widely exchanged, promoted, and applied in China's socialist production and construction in a timely manner, and state secrets can be strictly preserved.

The meeting considered that: First, scientific and technical intelligence agencies should be set up in the organs where scientific and technical intelligence is most needed and most easily concentrated; relevant personnel may be designated to concurrently perform this work or special organizations may be established in industrial and mining enterprises, people's communes, research institutions, design institutions, secondary schools and above, and other grassroots units across the country; books, materials, archives, publishing, news, and scientific and technical organizations should all bear part of the scientific and technical intelligence work. Second, scientific and technical intelligence agencies set up in various departments and units are components of the respective departments and units and should carry out their work under the leadership of the Party organizations and administrative leaders of the respective departments and units; the relationship between scientific and technical intelligence agencies is one of professional contact; the scientific and technical intelligence agencies of higher-level organs should provide professional guidance and assistance to the scientific and technical intelligence agencies of lower-level organs, and the central and regional scientific and technical intelligence centers should provide professional guidance and assistance to professional scientific and technical intelligence agencies. Third, the main tasks of scientific and technical intelligence agencies are: to accurately and promptly report on new scientific and technical achievements and scientific and technical development trends at home and abroad; to widely collect and accumulate systematic materials; all industrial and mining enterprises, people's communes, research institutions, design institutions, secondary schools and above, and other grassroots units across the country should immediately notify the scientific and technical intelligence center in their region and the scientific and technical intelligence agency in their department of any inventions, creations, new products, new technologies, scientific research results, and preliminary achievements; the national scientific and technical intelligence center and relevant professional scientific and technical intelligence centers should also be notified of particularly important achievements; the relevant scientific and technical intelligence agencies should be notified promptly of professional meetings, on-site meetings, exhibitions, and other scientific and technical activities held by various regions and departments related to science and technology; scientific and technical journals, materials, documents, etc. printed and published by various regions and departments should be proactively sent to the relevant scientific and technical intelligence agencies.

The holding of this meeting has played a role in promoting the widespread development of scientific and technical intelligence work throughout the country in the future, and it is also a good beginning for the exchange of scientific and technical intelligence materials and the mutual linking of various regions and units throughout the country. At the meeting, participants from various regions and departments brought more than 6,000 scientific and technical materials for extensive exchange, which will play a significant role in promoting new scientific and technical achievements and developing production.
