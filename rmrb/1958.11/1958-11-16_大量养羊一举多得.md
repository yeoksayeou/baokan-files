Raising sheep in large numbers is an important part of developing diversified operations in people's communes. Raising more sheep in people's communes can not only increase income from wool and hides, but also obtain mutton, sheep's milk, and fertilizer needed for agricultural production.

The propagation of sheep and goats is very fast. Among all kinds of livestock, its breeding speed is second only to pigs. Goats in agricultural areas of our country can generally produce two litters a year, and most litters are twins, some even producing three or four or more. The sheep (Hu sheep) in Zhejiang and Jiangsu areas also have a high breeding rate. Generally, every 100 ewes can produce more than 200 lambs a year. For example, in Haining County, Zhejiang Province, from January to September this year, the net propagation rate of sheep in the county has reached more than 76%, and the development is very rapid.

Sheep and goats can use coarse feed to produce large amounts of livestock products. Sheep and goats are ruminants and have a strong ability to utilize coarse feed, so they can make greater use of agricultural by-products and hillside weeds, transforming them into livestock products with high economic value. In addition to producing wool, cashmere, fur, and leather, sheep and goats can also supply people with a large amount of meat. Generally, each sheep or goat can produce 30 to 50 catties of meat. Developing sheep farming in people's communes can increase the local supply of meat, diversify meat foods, and enrich the dishes in public canteens. At the same time, sheep and goats can also be milked, especially goats produce more milk. For example, the Chengdu Ma goat in Sichuan can generally produce three catties of milk per day, and each lactation period lasts for five to eight months. If dairy goats are used for crossbreeding, milk production can be greatly increased. This is very convenient for supplying milk products needed by nurseries and "happiness homes" (homes for the elderly) in people's communes.

Of course, wool, cashmere, and hides are more important livestock products of sheep. Generally, each sheep can produce about one kilogram of wool per year, which can be greatly increased after improvement. Goats in the northern and Guizhou areas can generally produce more than four taels of cashmere per year, and up to ten taels. Wool and cashmere are of high value. Goat cashmere is worth more than three yuan per catty and is an important export commodity.

Sheep and goats can produce good lambskin and leather. For example, the lambskin produced by Hu sheep in Zhejiang, Jining goats in Shandong, and Zhongwei goats in Ningxia are all well-known at home and abroad. Sichuan goat leather is also an important export commodity.

Due to the high economic value of wool, cashmere, and hides, the cost of raising sheep is low, the income is high, and the profit is quick. According to the experience of Chongde County, Zhejiang, buying a small ewe only costs eight to ten yuan, and it can produce two lambs and about two catties of wool in the same year. Together with fertilizer, it can earn a total of 30 to 50 yuan. In 1958, the income from sheep raising in Hushao Township of the county accounted for 21% of the agricultural income. The average income from raising sheep per household in the Sixth Cooperative of this township can reach 167 yuan in 1958. Since 1955, the Wenbu Agricultural Cooperative in Xuwen County, Guangdong Province, has earned more than 15,000 yuan in total and accumulated more than 3,290 carts of sheep manure.

From the above situation, it can be seen that developing sheep farming is an extremely important part of the diversified operations of people's communes in agricultural areas.

Sheep manure has a low water content and its fertilizer effect is generally higher than that of pig manure. Raising more sheep in people's communes can also provide more fertilizer. According to a survey in Chongde County, Zhejiang, one sheep can accumulate 25 to 30 loads of fertilizer a year. In the first half of this year, the county accumulated more than 2 million loads of sheep manure. It can be seen that raising sheep and accumulating fertilizer can also support agricultural production. Xinjiang fine-wool sheep grow well in Jinggangshan, Jiangxi. This is a flock of sheep grazing on the Jinggangshan Farm.

    大量养羊一举多得
    左有礼
    大量饲养绵羊、山羊，是发展人民公社多种经营的一个重要内容。人民公社多养羊只，不但可以从羊毛、皮张上增加收入，同时还可以得到羊肉、羊乳和农业生产所需要的肥料。
    绵羊、山羊的增殖都很快，在各种家畜中，它的繁殖速度仅次于生猪。我国农业区的山羊，一般每年可以生产二胎，每胎大都是双羔，有些甚至一胎能产三、四只以上。浙江、江苏一带的绵羊（湖羊），繁殖率也很高，一般每一百只母羊，一年可以产羔羊二百只以上，例如浙江省海宁县今年1至9月，全县绵羊的净增殖率已达76％以上，发展是很快的。
    绵羊、山羊能利用粗饲料生产大量的畜产品。绵羊、山羊是反刍动物，利用粗饲料的能力很强，因此它能够更多地利用农副产品、山坡野草，转变为经济价值很高的畜产品。绵羊、山羊除了生产羊毛、羊绒、裘皮、板皮以外，还能供应人们大量的肉食。一般绵羊、山羊每头能产肉三十到五十多斤，人民公社发展养羊业就可以就地增加肉类的供应量，可以使肉食品多种多样化，丰富公共食堂的菜肴。同时，绵羊、山羊还可以挤奶，尤其是山羊产奶量较多，像四川的成都麻羊，一般每天能产奶三斤，每个泌乳期长达五到八个月。如果引用奶用山羊和它杂交，产奶量还可大量提高。这对供应人民公社托儿所、幸福院所需的奶品，非常方便。
    当然，羊毛、羊绒和皮张是羊的更重要畜产品。一般的绵羊，每只每年可产毛一公斤左右，经过改良后，还可以大大提高。北方和云贵地区的山羊，一般每年每只可产绒四两以上，多至十两。羊毛、羊绒的价值很高，山羊绒每斤值三元以上，是出口的重要物资。
    绵羊、山羊都能生产良好的羔皮和板皮。如浙江湖羊、山东济宁山羊、宁夏中卫山羊羔，所产的羔皮，都闻名于国内外。四川的山羊板皮也是出口重要物资。
    由于羊毛、羊绒、皮张等的经济价值高，因此，养羊的成本低，收入大，获利快。据浙江崇德县的经验，买进一只小母羊，只要八到十元，当年就能生羔羊二只，剪毛二斤左右，加上肥料，共可收入三十至五十元，该县虎哨乡1958年的养羊收入占到农业收入的21％。这个乡的六社1958年平均每户养羊收入可达一百六十七元。广东省徐闻县文部农业社，自1955年开始养羊以来，三年中共获利一万五千多元，并积羊粪三千二百九十多车。
    从以上的情况可以看到发展养羊是农业区人民公社多种经营的一个极其重要的内容。
    羊粪含水量少，肥效一般高于猪粪，人民公社多养羊只，同样可以多得肥料。据浙江崇德县调查，一只绵羊一年能积肥二十五到三十担，今年上半年全县共积羊肥二百多万担。由此可见，养羊积肥还能支援农业生产。新疆细毛羊在江西井岗山生长良好，这是井岗山农场放牧的羊群。
