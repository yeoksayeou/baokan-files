A daring and capable young steelworker greatly shortened the steelmaking time of one furnace of steel, and from then on, a open hearth furnace that was once called an "old ox furnace" stepped onto the ranks of advanced furnaces.

This young worker is Cui Zhinian, the assistant of No. 5 furnace in the First Steel Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel. On October 17th, he smelted a furnace of steel in only six hours and fifty minutes on this open hearth furnace, shortening the time by three to five hours compared to the previous average level, creating an unprecedented record for this furnace. Immediately afterwards, No. 5 furnace saw a vigorous leap forward situation of "one person leading, everyone chasing," which reduced the smelting time of each furnace of steel by two hours within a week compared to the first half of October.

The shortest smelting time in the history of No. 5 furnace of the First Steel Plant was eight hours and twenty-five minutes, and it was generally ten to twelve hours. This open hearth furnace had been used to smelt steel 328 times without a major overhaul. According to convention, if the furnace reaches the mid-term – having smelted two hundred times without a major repair – it is difficult to increase production. These circumstances made the steelworkers working on this furnace believe that it was impossible to shorten the smelting time to eight hours. However, Cui Zhinian's pioneering new steelmaking record fundamentally reversed the backward state of production of No. 5 furnace, changed people's old ideas, and made people deeply realize that: whoever has a higher communist style, whoever has the courage, whoever can obtain greater output.

This is how it started.

On October 15th – before the start of the high-yield week, the steelworkers of each furnace in the First Steel Plant set new targets for shortening the smelting time, some furnaces set it at seven hours, some at seven hours and ten minutes, only the steelworker Xu Chunmin of No. 5 furnace set the steelmaking time to more than eight hours. Second assistant Tan Yongqing was not satisfied with this target, he said: "The key is whether you dare to do it or not. If you dare to do it, you can break it even in six hours." First assistant Cui Zhinian immediately supported his opinion. However, steelworker Xu Chunmin disagreed. He said: "It's good to have enthusiasm, but you can't be rash! The furnace is old, and smelting a furnace of steel sometimes takes twelve or thirteen hours now, eight hours is advanced enough."

Cui Zhinian was very anxious seeing that his furnace was going to be the "old ox furnace" again during the high-yield week. He wanted to persuade the steelworker: "Master Xu, I think we can break seven hours, and No. 1 furnace is still a big furnace!" Before he could finish, Xu Chunmin interrupted and said: "What! The conditions of No. 1 furnace are different, you can't compare it." The "fear" of the furnace being too old to be fast, the fear of high sulfur content in the molten iron, the fear of inaccurate carbon content at the end of melting, and a series of "fears" tied Xu Chunmin tightly. His final conclusion was "It's easy to talk about, but difficult to do."

In the past, steelmaking has always been operated and directed by the steelworker. No. 5 furnace was no exception, and was controlled by steelworker Xu Chunmin. First assistant Cui Zhinian had always wanted to break the existing backward record. Usually, he carefully observed the furnace body and observed each process, but he couldn't exert his strength for a while. This time, since he verbally failed to convince the steelworker, he couldn't tolerate it, so he decided to do it himself for one furnace. He loudly requested to the steelworker: "Please allow me to smelt a furnace of steel, let's compete!" Cui Zhinian's request immediately won the support of the workers and also the support of the Communist Party branch secretary of the open hearth furnace workshop. He wanted to smelt steel himself.

On the night of the 17th, Cui Zhinian came to the open hearth furnace early with a nervous and excited mood to find the key, observe the furnace condition, blow the furnace roof, and do all the preparatory work. The workers on duty also created conditions for him. In the process of steelmaking, he boldly changed some operating methods, and at the same time paid attention to mobilizing the enthusiasm of every worker on the furnace. As a result, under the condition that the objective factors such as furnace condition and raw material supply were exactly the same as in the past, a furnace of steel was smelted in six hours and fifty minutes.

This achievement greatly inspired and encouraged all the steelworkers of No. 5 furnace. The next shift immediately created a new record of smelting a furnace of steel in six hours and forty minutes, and then each furnace broke through the average level of the past. Now, smelting a furnace of steel in seven hours has become a common occurrence on this furnace. Xu Chunmin also admitted defeat. After humbly learning from Cui Zhinian, his steelmaking time was also greatly shortened. The First Steel Plant was inspired from here, and launched a vigorous mass steelmaking movement throughout the plant.

    一炉钢创出一个新局面
    新华社记者  谭冰洁
   有一位敢想敢干的青年炼钢工人，把一炉钢的炼钢时间大大缩短，从此以后，原来被人称为“老牛炉”的一座平炉，一步登上了先进炉。
    这位青年工人是鞍钢第一炼钢厂五号炉的助手崔志年。10月17日，他在这座平炉上仅用六点五十分钟就炼出一炉钢，比过去一般水平缩短了三到五个钟点，创造了这座炉子的空前纪录。紧接着，五号炉出现了“一人领先，众人追赶”的猛烈跃进局面，在一周内，就使每炉钢的冶炼时间比10月上半月减少了两小时。
    第一炼钢厂五号炉有史以来最短的熔炼时间是八点二十五分钟，一般为十小时到十二小时。这座平炉已经炼了三百二十八次钢没有总检修。按照惯例，炉子到了中期——炼过二百次钢不总修，产量就很难提高。这些情况使得在这个炉子上工作的炼钢工认为把熔炼时间缩短到八小时是不可能的。但是，崔志年首创的炼钢新纪录，却从根本上扭转了五号炉生产的落后状态，改变了人们的老观点，使人们深刻地认识到：谁的共产主义风格高，谁就有胆量，谁就能获得更大的产量。
    事情是这样开始的。
    10月15日——高产周开始前，第一炼钢厂各炉炼钢工人都订出了缩短冶炼时间的新指标，有的炉是七小时，有的炉子是七点十分，唯有五号炉炼钢工徐纯民把炼钢时间订到八点以上。二助手谭永清对这个指标不满意，他说：“关键就看敢干不敢干，敢干六点也能打破。”一助手崔志年当即拥护他的意见。可是炼钢工徐纯民不同意。他说：“有热情是好的，可不能冒进！炉子老了，目前炼一炉钢有时得十二、三个钟头，八点已经够先进了”。
    崔志年眼看着高产周里自己的炉子又要当“老牛炉”，心里很着急，他想说服炼钢工：“徐师傅，我想七点可以打破，人家一号炉还是大炉子呢！”没等他说完，徐纯民就插上去说：“啥！一号炉条件不同，比不得。”怕炉子老不能快，怕铁水硫磺高，怕熔毕炭不准等等一系列的“怕”字，把徐纯民捆得紧紧的，他最后的结论是“讲是容易，做可困难”。
    炼钢，过去一直是炼钢工来操纵指挥，五号炉也不例外，是掌握在炼钢工徐纯民手里。一助手崔志年一直想打破现有的落后纪录。平时，他细心观察炉体，观察各工序，可是一时使不上劲。这次，他既然嘴上说不服炼钢工，却也不能就此容忍，便决心来干他一炉看看。他大声向炼钢工请求：“请允许我来炼一炉钢，咱们来较量较量吧！”崔志年这一要求立即获得工人们的拥护，也得到平炉车间中共党支部书记的支持。他要自己来炼钢了。
    17日夜晚，崔志年怀着紧张、兴奋的心情，提前来到平炉找关键，观察炉况，吹炉顶，把一切准备工作做好，上班工人也为他创造了条件。在炼钢过程中，他大胆地改变了一些操作方法，同时注意调动炉上每个工人的积极性。结果，到底在炉体条件、原料供应等客观因素和过去完全一样的情况下，用六小时五十分钟炼出了一炉钢。
    这一成绩大大启发和鼓舞了五号炉的全体炼钢工人，下一班紧接着就创造了六点四十分钟炼一炉钢的更新纪录，随后一炉炉都突破了往日的一般水平。现在，七点种炼一炉钢在这个炉上已成为平常事了。徐纯民也服输了，他虚心向崔志年学习后，炼钢时间也大大缩短。第一炼钢厂就从这里得到启发，在全厂范围内开展了轰轰烈烈的群众炼钢运动。
