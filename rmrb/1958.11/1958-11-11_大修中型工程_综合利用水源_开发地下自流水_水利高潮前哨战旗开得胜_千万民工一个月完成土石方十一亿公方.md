Xinhua News Agency Report: The preliminary battle for the larger-scale water conservancy high tide this winter and next spring has achieved brilliant results. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, nearly ten million laborers fighting on water conservancy sites for river network development, flood control, drainage, and water and soil conservation across the country have completed over 1.1 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work for the 1959 agricultural water conservancy year (starting October 1 this year) by the end of October. The early start, large scale, and rapid progress of water conservancy projects in various provinces and regions have greatly exceeded those of previous years. The commencement time of key projects was generally one month earlier than last year. In Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, and four other provinces, over two thousand large and medium-sized projects have already commenced. Twenty-two counties and cities in Shandong Province have completed well mechanization. One-sixth of the over ten thousand pond and dam projects started in Hunan Province have been completed, and nearly four hundred larger reservoirs will be completed successively in the near future. Forty key medium-sized river network development projects started in Henan Province have already completed more than half of the earth and stone work.

The water conservancy battle this winter and next spring is China's "Huaihai Campaign" to basically realize water conservancy. According to preliminary plans in various localities, the earth and stone work completed this winter and next spring will increase by one to two times compared to last winter and this spring. The victory of this campaign will enable China to smoothly and basically achieve water conservancy within the next two years. To ensure the victory of this decisive battle, all provinces and regions have resolutely continued to implement the three-main policy of focusing on small-scale projects, focusing on water storage, and focusing on community management. On the basis of summarizing experience, various localities have also selected typical examples and created many "model projects."

In areas where small-scale projects have been popularized, medium-sized projects are being built on a large scale, and river network development is being carried out on a large scale, with large and medium-sized projects as the backbone, to build irrigation systems, under the principle of focusing on small-scale projects. This is a feature of water conservancy construction this winter and next spring. Another feature is that projects are started in accordance with the overall planning of comprehensive utilization of water resources, so that irrigation, power generation, shipping, and aquaculture are closely integrated. Another feature is that various localities not only make extensive use of "sky water" (rainfall), "groundwater," and "external water" (inbound rivers), but also pay special attention to the development of underground artesian water. The recently concluded National Artesian Well Spring Visit and Symposium preliminarily planned to work hard this winter and next spring to develop 5,000 cubic meters per second of local artesian water, which can irrigate nearly 50 million mu of cultivated land.

Due to the unprecedented scale of water conservancy projects this winter and next spring, and the very busy production on the steel and agricultural fronts, with tight labor allocation, many areas have put forward the slogan of "vigorously promoting tool reform, improving technology, and striving for high work efficiency" as soon as winter construction began. According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, Hunan, Shanxi, and six other provinces have reformed more than 20 million tools, and the total average work efficiency in October in Jiangsu, Heilongjiang, and three other provinces was about six cubic meters per person per day, which is two times higher than the national average work efficiency last winter and this spring. This is an important reason why this preliminary battle has been successful.

    大修中型工程　综合利用水源　开发地下自流水
    水利高潮前哨战旗开得胜
    千万民工一个月完成土石方十一亿公方
    据新华社讯　今冬明春更大规模的水利高潮的序幕战役已经取得辉煌战绩。据农业部了解：战斗在全国河网化、防洪治涝、水土保持等水利工地的近千万民工，到10月底止，已经完成1959年农田水利年度（从今年10月1日开始）水利工程土石方十一亿多公方。各省区水利工程开工之早、规模之大、进度之快都大大超过了往年。重点工程的开工时间一般都比去年提前了一个月。江苏、陕西、江西等七省大、中型工程已开工的就达两千多处。山东省有二十二个县市已经完成了机井化。湖南省开工的一万多座塘坝工程已完工六分之一，近四百座较大水库将在最近先后建成。河南省开工的河网化中型重点工程四十处，目前已经完成了土石方一半以上。
    今冬明春的水利战役是我国基本实现水利化的“淮海大战”。据各地初步规划，今冬明春完成的土石方将比去冬今春增加一倍到两倍。这个战役的胜利将使我国在明、后年内顺利地基本上实现水利化。为了确保这个决战的胜利，各省区都坚决继续贯彻了以小型为主、以蓄为主、以社办为主的三主方针。各地在总结经验的基础上，还选择典型，作出了许许多多“样子工程”。
    小型工程已经普及的地区，在贯彻小型为主的方针下，并在已有的基础上大修中型工程，大搞河网化，以大、中型为骨干，建成灌溉系统。这是今冬明春兴修水利的一个特点。另一特点是：一开工就是按照水利资源综合利用的规划，使灌溉、发电、航运、水产等紧密结合。还有一个特点是：各地不仅大量利用“天上水”、“地下水”、“外来水”（入境河流），而且还特别注意开发地下自流水。不久前结束的全国自流井泉参观座谈会议初步规划，要苦干一冬春，开发五千秒公方地方自流水，这些水约可灌溉近五千万亩耕地。
    由于今冬明春水利工程空前浩大，钢铁、农业战线生产又十分繁忙，劳力调配紧张，许多地区冬修一开工就提出了“大搞工具改革，提高技术，力争高工效”的口号。据农业部不完全统计：湖南、山西等八省已改革工具两千多万件，江苏、黑龙江等五省10月份总平均工效每人每日六方左右，比去冬今春全国平均工效高出两倍。这是这个序幕战役所以取得胜利的重要原因。
