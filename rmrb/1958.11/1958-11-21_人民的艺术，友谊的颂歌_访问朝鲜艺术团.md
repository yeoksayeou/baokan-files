The 150 outstanding artists of the Art Troupe of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have brought to their Chinese brothers a magnificent picture of the vigorous development of Korean people's art and a passionate ode to the friendship between the Korean and Chinese people. After our visit with the art troupe's leaders and principal actors following their premiere performance, this impression has become even stronger in our minds.

Whether it is the modern song and dance depicting the magnificent picture of the Korean people striding on the "Chollima" (Thousand-Li Horse) to accelerate socialist construction, or the traditional Korean classical and folk music, ballads, and dances, the entire performance of the art troupe enthusiastically praises the heroic and unyielding fighting will and the great heroic spirit of the Korean people, and demonstrates the creative characteristics and vitality of socialist people's art.

Park Kwang-woo, Deputy Head of the Art Troupe, cited the creative process of the dance "Iron Water Flows" as an example, and told us about the creative path currently taken by Korean artists, pointing out that this path is already a commonly used creative method for them to create and develop Korean people's art.

Deputy Head Park Kwang-woo's conversation brought back to our minds the moving scene from the premiere performance. On the stage appeared a group of steelworkers holding iron rods, engaged in intense labor before the tapping of the furnace. Suddenly, a line of actresses dressed in fiery red costumes and headscarves, stepped onto the stage with light steps, and in front of the steelworkers, a torrent of molten iron instantly appeared. Then, the actresses formed a circle and waved their long, fiery red sleeves towards the sky. Under the intense red light, a moving scene of "Iron Water Flows" appeared on the stage. The audience below the stage all felt the heat of the freshly smelted iron and felt that the spraying sparks could almost splash onto them at any time...

This dance, with a deep foundation in real life and rich imagination, was originally created by a young Korean dancer. He went deep into the life of a steel plant for three months and finally choreographed this moving dance with a very novel expressive method. Deputy Head Park Kwang-woo told us that the leading comrades of the Korean Party and government and many famous dance artists had participated in the creation of this dance. After watching the performance of this dance, Comrade Kim Il-sung once said that just like the rapid development of Korean industrial and agricultural construction, the art industry has also mounted the Chollima.

An Seong-hee, the meritorious actress who perfectly shaped the moving image of Korean women with pearl-like purity on the Beijing stage, also shared her personal experience, narrating how she obtained inexhaustible creative power from the source of people's lives.

On the evening of the 19th, when An Seong-hee first performed the solo dance "Pearl Dancer" for the Beijing audience, the beautiful lighting on the stage took us to a scenic seaside. From a sea clam containing a huge pearl, a graceful pearl beauty emerged, dancing lightly. An Seong-hee's graceful dance and extremely rich emotions profoundly embodied the steadfast will and pure and noble chastity of Korean women.

After the performance, the dance artist, who began learning to dance at the age of six, told us that she only started her real artistic life after returning to North Korea from South Korea in 1946. In these years, under the cultivation and care of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government, she had spent four and a half years studying dance in the Soviet Union, attended the World Youth Festival five times, and more importantly, during the Korean War and the great economic construction after the war, she had repeatedly gone to the front lines with many Korean artists to perform for the soldiers, for the workers and peasants, and lived with them. An Seong-hee said that whenever she performs the newly created "Pearl Dancer" after liberation, this dance that expresses the glorious image of women, the women heroes in Korean history often appear before her eyes, and at the same time, the simple images of those heroic female soldiers and ordinary Korean working women on the Korean battlefield often appear.

The performances by artists from our close and friendly neighboring country not only presented a splendid picture of Korean art before our eyes, but also gave us a vivid lesson in China-Korea friendship. Almost all of their programs were performed alternately with Korean and Chinese songs and dances. The touching scene of "Meeting on the Heights" appearing amidst the heroic sounds of warhorses is a microcosm of the people's armies of the two countries fighting side by side to defeat the American paper tiger. Later we learned that the actors participating in this dance drama were all soldiers who had personally fought the invaders and fought alongside the Chinese People's Volunteers. No wonder they performed so realistically, so vividly, so movingly!

The round and resonant voice of the famous bass singer and meritorious actor Kim Wan-woo still lingers in our minds. On the unforgettable evening of the 19th, listening to Kim Wan-woo's beautiful singing and watching his rich expressions, we seemed to climb to the top of that high mountain, looking around at "My Hometown - Pochonbo"; we seemed to be on the high peaks of Erlang Mountain, witnessing with our own eyes the magnificent picture of the Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers overcoming the natural dangers of Erlang Mountain and building the Kangzang Highway.

"Why did I sing these two songs?" Kim Wan-woo said to us after the performance: "I want to sing the praises of our people, the praises of the friendship between our two peoples."

"Our two peoples have forged a deep friendship with blood in the struggle against imperialism. Today, when we are engaged in the great socialist construction, we will always remember how we fought. I dedicate this song to the Chinese people with this feeling." Kim Wan-woo said to us with infinite deep feelings.

Kim Wan-woo said that he sang the song "Erlang Mountain" with infinite admiration. The news of China's Great Leap Forward that he heard really excited him. Although the current Great Leap Forward of the Chinese people has far exceeded the miracles created by the heroes who conquered Erlang Mountain, he still wants to use the song "Erlang Mountain" to praise China's Great Leap Forward.

We cannot forget the Chinese folk song "High Mount Taizi" sung by the famous tenor singer Choi Chang-eun. His voice was bright, his articulation was clear, his emotion was full, and he expressed the content of the song very completely.

This singer of the Korean people has been performing for the Chinese People's Volunteers every year since 1950. In those days of shared life and death, the flesh-and-blood friendship between the two peoples deeply moved him. He loved the Volunteers so much, just like loving his own compatriots. He said that in the Battle of Shangganling, he personally saw the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting to the death to protect the land of Korea and protect the safety of the two countries. He said that when he sang the Chinese song "High Mount Taizi" on the stage of the Capital Theatre, he felt as if he was standing on Shangganling, singing for China and for the Chinese people with the same feeling as the Volunteer soldiers loved Korea.

After watching the art troupe's performance, we couldn't help but recall what Zhao Lingchu, the head of the troupe, said to us: "We have brought songs from the bottom of the hearts of the Korean people, and these songs express the deep friendship of the Korean people towards the Chinese people!"

Yes, this is the art of the Korean people! It is an ode to China-Korea friendship!

    人民的艺术，友谊的颂歌
    ——访问朝鲜艺术团
    本报记者　于民生　袁木
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国艺术团的一百五十位优秀艺术家，给中国兄弟带来了朝鲜人民艺术蓬勃发展的一幅绚丽图景，带来了朝鲜人民对朝中人民友谊的热情颂歌。经过首次演出之后我们对艺术团负责人和主要演员的访问，这个印象在我们的心目中就更加强烈起来。
    无论是表现朝鲜人民跨上“千里马”加速社会主义建设的雄伟图景的现代歌舞，或者是传统的朝鲜古典和民间的音乐、民谣和舞蹈，艺术团的整个演出都热情地赞颂了朝鲜人民英勇不屈的斗争意志和伟大的英雄气概，表现了社会主义的人民艺术的创作特点和生命力。
    艺术团副团长朴光羽举出舞蹈“铁水奔流”的创作过程为例，向我们叙述了目前朝鲜艺术家的创作道路，并且指出这条道路已经是他们创造和发展朝鲜人民艺术时普遍运用的创作方法。
    朴光羽副团长的谈话又把首次演出时那一幕动人的情景展现在我们的眼前。舞台上出现了一批手执铁棍的炼铁工人，他们正在高炉旁进行出铁前的紧张劳动。忽然之间，一列身穿火红的舞衣和头扎火红纱巾的女演员，踏着轻快的舞步飞也似地走上舞台，在炼铁工人的面前，立刻出现了一条铁水倾泻的洪流。接着，女演员们围成一个圆圈齐向空中挥舞着火红的长舞袖，在强烈的红色灯光照耀下，舞台上顿时出现了一幅“铁水奔流”的动人景象。台下的观众，人人都感到刚出炉的铁水的炙热，感到喷射的火花几乎随时都会溅到自己的身上……。
    这个具有深厚的现实生活基础和丰富想像力的舞蹈，原来是朝鲜的一位青年舞蹈演员创作的。他在一个钢铁厂里深入生活了三个月，最后编出了这个表现方法十分新颖的动人舞蹈。朴光羽副团长告诉我们，朝鲜党和政府的领导同志和许多著名的舞蹈艺术家，曾经参加过这个舞的创作工作。金日成同志看了这个舞蹈的演出以后曾经说过，同朝鲜工农业建设正在飞跃发展一样，艺术事业也跨上了千里马。
    在北京舞台上给观众们完美地塑造了具有珍珠般纯洁性格的朝鲜妇女的动人形象的功勋演员安圣姬，也以她自己的亲身体会，叙述了她如何从人民生活的源泉中得到了取之不尽的创作力量。
    在19日安圣姬第一次给北京观众表演单人舞“珍珠舞姬”的那个晚上，舞台上美妙的灯光把我们带到了一个景色动人的海边，从一颗藏有巨大珍珠的海蚌中，轻盈地走出了一位翩翩起舞的珍珠美女。安圣姬那优美的舞姿，极其丰富的感情，深刻地体现了朝鲜妇女坚贞不屈的意志和纯洁高尚的贞操。
    演出以后，这位从六岁就开始学舞的舞蹈艺术家告诉我们，她从1946年由南朝鲜回到北朝鲜以后，才开始了她的真正的艺术生活。这些年来，她在朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的培养和关怀下，曾经有四年半的时间在苏联学习舞蹈，五次出席过世界青年联欢节，更重要的是，在朝鲜战争期间和战后的伟大经济建设工作中，她曾经同许多朝鲜艺术家一道，多次到战地为战士们演出，为工人和农民演出，同他们生活在一起。安圣姬说，每当她表演解放后新创作的“珍珠舞姬”这个表现妇女的光辉形象的舞蹈时，朝鲜历史上的那些妇女英雄常常在她的眼前浮现出来，同时也常常就会出现那些朝鲜战场上的英雄女战士和普通朝鲜劳动妇女的朴素形象。
    来自我们唇齿相依的友好邻邦的艺术家们的演出，不仅把一幅绚丽的朝鲜艺术图景展现在我们的眼前，而且也给我们上了一堂生动的中朝友谊课。他们的全部节目几乎都是朝鲜歌舞和中国歌舞相间演出的。在英雄的战马声中出现的“高地相逢”的令人感动的场景，是一幅两国的人民军队并肩作战挫败美国纸老虎的缩影。后来我们才知道，参加这个舞剧演出的演员，都是亲手打击过侵略者的战士，同中国人民志愿军并肩作过战。难怪他们表演得那样逼真，那样生动，那样感动人！
    著名男低音歌唱家、功勋演员金完羽那圆润宏亮的歌声依然萦绕在我们的脑海里。在19日这个难忘的夜晚里，听着金完羽那美妙的歌声，看着他那丰富的表情，我们仿佛登上那高山之颠，向四面眺望“我的故乡——普天堡”；我们宛如置身在二郎山的万丈高峰上，亲眼看到了中国人民解放军战士战胜二郎山的天险，修通康藏公路的宏伟图景。
    “我为什么要演唱这两首歌曲呢？”金完羽在演出以后对我们说：“我要歌颂我们的人民，歌颂我们两国人民的友谊。”
    “我们两国人民在反对帝国主义的斗争中用鲜血结成了深厚的友谊，今天我们在进行伟大的社会主义建设的时候，我们也将永远记住我们是怎样战斗过来的。我就是怀着这种心情把这首歌献给中国人民的”。金完羽怀着无限的深情对我们说。
    金完羽说，他是怀着无限敬佩的心情演唱“二郎山”这支歌曲的。他所听到的中国大跃进的消息实在使他振奋，尽管中国人民目前的大跃进已远远超过了征服二郎山的英雄们所创造的奇迹，但他还是要用“二郎山”这支歌来歌颂中国的大跃进。
    我们不能忘记著名男高音歌唱家崔昌殷演唱的那首中国民歌“高高太子山”。他的歌喉嘹亮，咬字清晰，感情充沛，十分完满地表达了歌曲的内容。
    这位朝鲜人民的歌唱家，从1950年起，每年他都有一个时间为中国人民志愿军演出。在那些生死与共的日子里，两国人民血肉相连的友谊深深感动了他，他是那样地热爱志愿军，就像热爱自己的同胞姊妹一样。他说，在上甘岭战斗中，他曾亲眼看到中国人民志愿军战士冒死忘生的保卫朝鲜的土地，保卫两国的安全。他说，当他在首都剧场的舞台上演唱“高高太子山”这首中国歌曲时，他觉得他好像是站在上甘岭，怀着志愿军战士热爱朝鲜那样的心情，为中国而歌唱，为中国人民而歌唱。
    看了艺术团的表演以后，我们不由得想起了赵灵出团长对我们说过的一句话：“我们带来了发自朝鲜人民内心的歌声，这歌声表达了朝鲜人民对中国人民的深厚友情！”
    是的，这是朝鲜人民的艺术！是中朝友谊的颂歌！
