Xinhua News Agency, 14th. Heilongjiang, Jilin, Shandong, Jiangxi, Inner Mongolia, and other provinces and autonomous regions are widely organizing cadres and the masses to study Chairman Mao's important document "On Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers."

    The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice on the 13th to party organizations at all levels regarding the study of this document, requiring all localities to immediately organize cadres and the broad masses for extensive and in-depth study; requiring that through the study and propaganda of this important document, cadres and the people of the province can profoundly understand the spiritual essence of this document, make correct judgments about the current situation of the struggle of the people of all countries in the world against imperialism, especially the aggression and oppression of US imperialism, as well as the current situation of the struggle in the Taiwan Strait region, and further strengthen their confidence and determination. The notice also requires party committees at all levels to strengthen leadership over this work, and leading cadres at and above the county level must first study well, and make this study and propaganda closely integrated with the socialist and communist education movement currently underway. At present, party committees at all levels in Heilongjiang Province are seizing leadership of this study. As of the 10th, according to incomplete statistics from the four special districts of Songjiang, Nenjiang, Hejiang, and Mudanjiang, and Harbin City, more than 2,691,000 people had participated in the study and discussion.

    Party committees at all levels in Jilin Province have successively made arrangements for studying this document. The Changchun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China notified party committees at all levels to conscientiously organize study and conduct discussions in light of ideological realities. At present, more than 300,000 people from factories, enterprises, institutions, and schools in Changchun City have participated in the study. The Political Department of the Jilin Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army immediately convened an emergency telephone conference to arrange the study after the publication of this document. Some units held enlarged meetings of the party committee overnight, and all units generally convened study mobilization meetings the next day. Many units telephoned or wrote letters to officers and soldiers who had gone to the countryside. Representatives attending the enlarged meeting of the military region party committee and cadres of the military region organs listened to two reports successively. Leading cadres at all levels wrote report outlines based on their personal study experience and went to the troops to give reports to the soldiers.

    The Propaganda Department of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice to the propaganda departments of all cities, prefectures, and county committees on November 5, requiring that all levels of cadres be immediately organized to study this document conscientiously, combining production, arranging appropriate time, and adopting a learning method that combines concentration and decentralization, reading and discussion. Workers, members of the people's communes, and students in secondary schools and above should also be organized to conduct reports in conjunction with production and study. Cadres and the masses in Shandong are very fond of this important document and are vying to purchase and read it. Of the 200,000 copies recently reprinted by Shandong People's Publishing House, more than 90,000 copies were distributed in Jinan City alone in the two days of the 10th and 11th.

    The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, chaired by the first secretary Yang Shangkui, held a meeting on the 13th to arrange a propaganda and study campaign for cadres and the broad masses throughout the province. The Provincial Party Committee required party committees at all levels to organize two million people to study Chairman Mao's important document "On Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers." Through this study, the broad masses of cadres and people will correctly understand the essence of revolutionary forces as the rising sun, and imperialism and reactionaries as the setting sun, and recognize the current international and domestic situation. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee meeting pointed out that the study and propaganda of this important political document is an integral part of the comprehensive communist education movement currently underway, and all localities should make appropriate arrangements. Two million people should be organized including cadres, workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants to participate in this study, and through them carry out vigorous propaganda among the broad masses. Organs and steel construction sites must guarantee a certain amount of time for study. District Party Committees and local city and county committees must grasp key areas to carry out learning activities. In addition to reading documents, the learning methods should include the serious organization of symposiums and discussions, in-depth development of airing views, contending, and debating, to truly solve the problems of ideological understanding. The broad masses can learn through forms such as reading newspapers and symposiums.

    The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to systematically study this important document for one month, starting from November 10. The Propaganda Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued a notice requiring all people's communes, industrial and mining enterprises, institutions, organizations, schools, and other units in the region to conscientiously study this important document of Chairman Mao, and to conduct debates in conjunction with the current situation, raise awareness, eliminate various incorrect ideological concepts, boost revolutionary enthusiasm, and improve revolutionary vigilance, to accelerate China's socialist construction. Many cadres, students, and workers from organs at the autonomous region level and Hohhot City have read and held discussions on this political document immediately after it was published in the newspaper. Under the organization of the school party committee, faculty, staff, and students of the Inner Mongolia Medical College have been conducting collective reading of the document and discussions for two days.

    In addition, the broad masses of cadres and people in Shanghai, Henan, Hubei, Xi'an, Chongqing, Chengdu, and other provinces and cities are also widely studying this important document. The Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued a notice requiring that a surge of learning this document be quickly launched throughout the city. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has also decided to organize people from all walks of life to study this document as the current top priority.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th. Cadres at all levels of central state organs are widely studying and discussing Chairman Mao's important document "On Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers" in depth theoretically and practically. This study is being conducted in conjunction with the current communist education movement, which further helps cadres liberate their minds and boost their energy. Many organs have launched mass mobilization through this study movement, preparing to launch a larger-scale leap forward movement to present gifts for the 1959 New Year's Day.

    After the publication of Chairman Mao's document, Comrade Zhou Enlai made an important report to the vast number of cadres on studying this document. In the past few days, through in-depth study and discussion, cadres of all agencies have been invigorated and greatly encouraged ideologically. In the study, the majority of cadres universally analyzed four questions theoretically and in connection with the current situation of the anti-imperialist struggle, namely: why imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers; why strategically we should despise the enemy, but tactically we should value the enemy; analyzing the international situation where the East Wind prevails over the West Wind; and exploring the profound historical and practical significance of Chairman Mao's document.

    Cadres from many organs pointed out that the issue of the decadence of imperialism and the role of the masses in history is a fundamental issue in the contemporary revolutionary movement. The conclusion made by Chairman Mao is full of revolutionary confidence and is the most profound and vivid characterization of the essence of imperialism. The application of this historical materialism point of view in real life actually gives us a sharp spiritual weapon for the anti-imperialist struggle, and the Marxist theory grasped by the masses will generate great power. People believe what Chairman Mao pointed out: "The life of the imperialists will not be very long," and in our generation, we can see the imperialists being finally sent to the grave.

    Many veteran cadres who participated in the First and Second Revolutionary Civil Wars and the War of Resistance Against Japan have profoundly realized from their own experience that the power of the people is infinite. Many cadres said that Chairman Mao saw the dawn of victory when the revolution was extremely difficult. Today, under the unprecedentedly favorable situation in which the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, everyone should have the great spirit and revolutionary optimism of Chairman Mao. If the people have soaring fighting spirit, it will be invincible.

    Many organs combined this study with the communist education movement, liberated the minds of cadres through study, established communist style and communist labor attitude, and launched the 1959 New Year's Day gift-presenting movement. At present, many units have made arrangements for these two kinds of studies, emphasizing the combination of theory and practice, emphasizing the combination of the anti-imperialist struggle and the struggle against nature, and adopting a method of combining the virtual and the real in discussions, so that through study, the ideological awareness of the masses can be further improved, overcoming blindness, giving play to subjective initiative, and promoting greater leaps in work. The Ministry of Culture has decided to immediately launch a mass movement of large-scale satellite launching to present gifts for New Year's Day through study. While studying Chairman Mao's works, the cadres of the Chinese Academy of Sciences required to be able to "have a panoramic view of the world situation, look forward to the future, and study the needs of the country," and they launched a movement to present gifts for New Year's Day. Some scientific research institutes proposed important cutting-edge scientific research projects that exceeded those of capitalist countries. Some units recently held a general meeting of all cadres, explaining the current domestic and international situation while arranging the study and the planning for the New Year's Day gift-presenting. Some units also analyzed the future situation through study and arranged a grand gift-presenting plan for the tenth anniversary of the National Day next year, incorporating several festival gift-presenting movements before the National Day next year into the overall plan.

    中共山东省委宣传部曾于11月5日向各市、地、县委宣传部发出通知，要求立即组织各级干部，结合生产，适当安排时间，采取集中和分散相结合、阅读和讨论相结合的学习方法，对这一文件作认真的学习。对工人、人民公社社员、中等以上学校学生，也要结合生产和学习，组织报告员进行传达报告。山东各地干部群众，对这一重要文献非常热爱，争相购阅，山东人民出版社最近重版的二十万册，仅济南市在10日、11日两天，就发行了九万多册。
    中共江西省委会13日在第一书记杨尚奎主持下，开会布置了全省干部和广大群众的宣传学习运动。省委要求各级党委组织二百万人学习毛主席“论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”这一重要文献，通过这一学习使广大干部和群众正确认识革命力量如旭日东升，帝国主义和反动派已日落西山的本质，认清目前国际国内形势。江西省委会议指出：这一重要政治文献的学习和宣传工作，是目前全面开展的共产主义教育运动的组成部分之一，各地应作妥善安排。要组织广大干部以及工农兵学商二百万人参加这一学习，并通过他们在广大人民群众中开展大张旗鼓的宣传。机关干部和钢铁工地都要保证一定的时间进行学习。区党委、各地市县委都要掌握重点地区开展学习活动。学习方法，除阅读文件外，应认真组织座谈讨论，深入开展鸣放辩论，达到真正解决思想认识问题的目的。广大群众可采取读报和座谈会等形式进行学习。
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会，已确定从11月10日开始，以一个月的时间系统地学习这一重要文献。中共内蒙古自治区委员会宣传部最近发出通知，要求全区所有人民公社、工矿企业、机关团体和学校等单位都要认真学习毛主席这一重要文献，并且结合当前形势开展辩论，提高认识，消除各种不正确思想观念，鼓足革命干劲，提高革命警惕，加速我国社会主义建设。自治区一级和呼和浩特市的很多机关干部、学生、工人等在这一政治文献在报纸上刊出后，即进行了阅读和座谈。内蒙古医学院的教职员和学生，在校党委组织下，已经进行了两天的集体阅读文件和座谈。
    此外，上海、河南、湖北、西安、重庆、成都等省市的广大干部和群众也正在广泛地学习这一重要文献。中共西安市委最近还曾发出通知，要求迅速在全市范围内掀起学习这一文献的热潮。上海市政协也决定把组织各界人士学习这个文献，作为当前的首要任务。
    据新华社15日讯　中央国家机关各级干部正在广泛地从理论上和实践上深入学习讨论毛主席“论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的重要文献。这个学习同当前的共产主义教育运动结合进行，进一步帮助干部解放了思想，鼓起了干劲，许多机关已通过这个学习运动，深入发动群众，准备掀起向1959年元旦献礼的更大规模的跃进运动。
    毛主席的这一文献发表以后，周恩来同志又向广大干部作了关于学习这一文献的重要报告，这几天以来，各机关干部通过深入的学习和讨论，个个人心振奋，思想上受到了很大的鼓舞。广大干部在学习中普遍从理论上以及联系当前反帝国主义斗争的形势，分析了四个问题，即：为什么说帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎；为什么在战略上藐视敌人，在战术上要重视敌人；分析东风压倒西风的国际形势；探讨毛主席这一文献的深刻历史意义和现实意义。
    许多机关的干部指出，帝国主义的腐朽性和人民群众在历史上的作用问题，是当代革命运动中的一个根本性问题。毛主席所作出的论断，充满了革命的信心，是对帝国主义本质最深刻最形象的刻划。这个历史唯物主义观点在现实生活中的运用，实际上是给了我们一个反帝国主义斗争的锐利的精神武器，马克思主义理论为群众所掌握，它将产生伟大的力量。人们相信毛主席所指出的：“帝国主义者的寿命不会很长了”，在我们这一代，可以看到帝国主义者将最终被送入坟墓。
    许多参加过第一次、第二次国内革命战争和抗日战争的老干部，从亲身的经历中深刻体会到人民群众的力量是无穷无尽的。许多干部说，毛主席在革命极其艰难的时候就看到胜利的曙光，在今天东风压倒西风的空前有利的形势下，每一个人都更应该具有毛主席这种伟大的气魄和革命乐观主义精神，人民群众有了冲天的昂扬的斗志，那将是无敌的。
    许多机关把这一学习同共产主义教育运动结合起来进行，通过学习，解放干部的思想，树立共产主义风格和共产主义的劳动态度，掀起1959年元旦献礼运动。现在不少单位对这两种学习作了安排，强调理论联系实际，强调反帝斗争和同自然作斗争结合起来，在讨论中采取虚实并举的方法，以使通过学习来进一步提高群众的思想觉悟，克服盲目性，发挥主观能动性，促进工作更大的跃进。文化部已决定通过学习立即掀起一个元旦献礼大放卫星的群众运动。中国科学院的干部一面学习毛主席的著作，要求能够“总览世界形势，展望前途，研究国家的需要”，一面掀起了向元旦献礼的运动，有的科学研究所提出了超过资本主义国家的重要的尖端科学研究项目。还有的单位最近召开了全体干部大会，一面讲解当前国内外的形势，一面安排学习和元旦献礼的规划。有的单位还通过学习分析了未来的形势，安排了到明年国庆十周年的宏伟的献礼规划，把明年国庆以前的几次节日献礼运动纳入了总的规划之中。
