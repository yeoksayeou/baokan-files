    The nation is now in a period of rapid development, where "one day equals twenty years." Illuminated by the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, our country's industrial and agricultural production has achieved a great victory of overall leap forward, and the technological and cultural revolutions are advancing rapidly. On this basis, the people's commune movement and the nationwide industrialization movement mark a new stage in our country's socialist construction. What is particularly gratifying is that as the material products of society multiply, people's communist spirit is also growing rapidly. This is particularly evident in the younger generation of our country. On all fronts of socialist revolution and socialist construction, the vast numbers of young people, fighting alongside their fathers and brothers, are spirited, high-spirited, and full of energy, demonstrating their active and dynamic strength. Today, the Second National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism, held in our capital, is a great review of the achievements of young people across the country in revolution and construction, and also a mobilization meeting to further mobilize young people across the country to more bravely build socialism rapidly and prepare conditions for the transition to communism. We warmly congratulate the success of this conference.
    The five thousand young people attending this conference are outstanding representatives of young people on all fronts. They collectively reflect the surging communist spirit of young people in our country. This spirit has the following main characteristics: First, it promotes the communist spirit of labor. They do not set conditions for their work, do not calculate rewards for their labor, go wherever the Party directs them, and fight wherever there are difficulties. They have shown through their heroic and exemplary actions that they are indeed a shock force in the construction of the motherland. Second, it promotes the style of daring to think, speak, and act. They dare to break superstitions and boldly innovate and create. In the past year, our country has produced many inventions and creations that have reached the world's advanced level, the vast majority of which were created by ordinary young workers, peasants, and intellectuals. Third, it is moving towards the intellectualization of workers and peasants and the laborization of intellectuals. Young students have launched work-study programs and various degrees of part-work, part-study activities, while young workers and peasants have launched cultural and theoretical studies and literary and artistic creation activities, acting as the main force in the cultural revolution. Fourth, it promotes a high degree of patriotism and collectivism. In implementing "militarized organization, combat-ready action, collectivized living, and democratized management," hundreds of millions of young people have shown the greatest enthusiasm and vitality, consciously strengthened the cultivation of organization, discipline, and democratic spirit, and become the vanguard in rapidly changing backward habits and establishing new customs. The surge of this communist spirit among young people in our country not only promotes the great leap forward in various construction undertakings, but also allows us to further see the rapid growth of communist new people, indicating that the younger generation in our country is promising and capable of shouldering the great mission of building socialism and communism.
    Our Party has always attached great importance to the revolutionary role of youth. Comrade Mao Zedong likened young people to the sun at eight or nine in the morning, believing that they are the most active, energetic, willing to learn, and least conservative force in the entire social force. Therefore, the Party, as the representative of the new force of human society, regards educating the younger generation as one of the Party's most important tasks. The vast numbers of young people have indeed not disappointed the Party's hopes. At every critical moment of the revolution, in the face of every new combat task, young people in our country, especially young activists, have always been the first to respond to the Party's call, dedicating themselves to revolutionary struggle, and constantly transforming themselves and raising their communist consciousness in the course of practical struggle.
    In the great struggle to build socialism and communism, the work of cultivating and educating young people is even more important. People are the decisive factor in building our country. To build socialism and communism, we need "completely new people." According to the descriptions of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, these new people are politically and ideologically pure and noble, and they "work for society without compensation, without considering the differences of each person, without the slightest old views, without conservative psychology, and old habits." These new people are also complete and broad in knowledge and ability, they are "people with comprehensive knowledge and comprehensive training, that is, people who can do everything." Who is most likely to become such a person? Without a doubt, it is the younger generation that has grown up under the direct education of the Party, the younger generation whose communist spirit is constantly rising. After the basic realization of the people's commune system in our country, the remnants of private ownership of the means of production have gradually disappeared, the old and unreasonable patriarchal system is being eliminated, and bourgeois legal ideology has been further criticized. This means that the chains that have historically bound young people are about to be completely shattered, thereby opening up a broad world for the all-round and healthy growth of young people.
    In order to cultivate the younger generation in our country into new communist people faster and better, we must continue to guide young people to actively participate in the actual struggle of the whole people, and constantly strengthen socialist and communist education in the struggle. Currently, in the struggle to continue to develop and consolidate the people's communes, in the struggle to run industry by the whole people with steel as the key link, in the struggle to greatly reform education, and in the struggle to organize the people's livelihood and welfare, we must boldly use the strength of young people, give full play to their enthusiasm and creative spirit, and give full play to their leading and shock role. At the same time, our Party and League organizations at all levels must do their best to ensure that all activities can achieve the effect of cultivating and educating young people, the effect of increasing knowledge, exercising ability, cultivating morality, and enhancing physical fitness in organizing young people to carry out all activities. During the period of "three years of hard work," we should pay attention to cherishing and valuing the enthusiasm of young people, combine labor and learning well, combine hard work and rest well, continue to realize Chairman Mao's call for "good health, good learning, and good work," give full play to the positive role of young people, enable young people to achieve all-round and healthy growth, and cultivate them into a new generation of communists who are red and expert, and comprehensively developed. This is the unified historical task of building a new society and cultivating new people.
    The young people attending this conference have already made certain contributions to the motherland and the people. We congratulate them on their achievements. We hope that they will carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, learn modestly, never be arrogant, continue to advance, and continue to achieve new achievements. We know that activists are the advanced part of the masses, activists are good examples for the masses, and are the backbone force in mass movements, on which our Party relies to lead the masses and carry out mass movements. Activists lead the masses forward, forming mass movements, and mass movements rapidly promote social progress and cultivate more new activists. This is the law of the continuous development of our revolutionary cause. Through this conference, the communist consciousness of young activists will be further enhanced, and the vast numbers of young people across the country will be encouraged to more vigorously learn from the activists. We firmly believe that this conference will be able to complete its mission and play a huge role in promoting the mass movement to build socialism and in the cause of cultivating new communist people.

### 大有希望的青年一代

    大有希望的青年一代
    我们的国家正处在“一天等于二十年”的飞跃时期。在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的照耀下，我国的工农业生产获得了全面跃进的伟大胜利，技术革命和文化革命一日千里地向前推进。在这个基础上兴起的人民公社运动和全民办工业运动，标志着我国的社会主义建设，已经发展到一个新的阶段。特别令人欣喜的是在社会的物质产品成倍增长的同时，人们的共产主义精神也在迅速的成长。这在我国青年一代的身上，是表现得特别显著的。在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的各个战线上，广大青年在和他们的父兄一道作战中，精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发，干劲冲天，显示出了他们的积极活跃的力量。今天在我国首都举行的第二次全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会，是全国青年在革命和建设中各项成就的大检阅，也是进一步动员全国青年更英勇地为迅速建成社会主义和为过渡到共产主义准备条件的进军大会。我们热烈地祝贺这次大会的成功。
    出席这次大会的五千个青年，是各个战线上青年的优秀代表。从他们身上集中地反映了我国青年的共产主义精神的高涨。这种精神具有这样一些主要特征：第一，是发扬了共产主义的劳动精神。他们工作不讲条件，劳动不计报酬，党指向哪里，就奔向哪里，哪里有困难，就战斗在哪里。他们以英勇的模范行动，表现了自己确实是一支祖国建设的突击队。第二，是发扬了敢想敢说敢做的风格。他们勇于破除迷信，大胆地革新创造。一年来，我国产生了许许多多达到世界先进水平的创造发明，其中绝大多数是出自普通的工农青年和知识青年之手。第三，是向着知识分子劳动化和工农分子知识化的方向迈进。青年学生开展了勤工俭学和各种程度的半工半读活动，工农青年展开了文化理论学习和文艺创作活动，充当了文化革命中的主力军。第四，是发扬了高度的爱国主义和集体主义的思想。在实行“组织军事化，行动战斗化，生活集体化，管理民主化”中，亿万青年表现了最大的热情和活力，自觉地加强了组织性、纪律性和民主精神的锻炼，成为迅速改变落后的习惯和树立新的风气的先锋队。我国青年这种共产主义精神的高涨，它的意义不仅在于促进了各项建设事业的大跃进，而且使我们进一步看到共产主义新人的迅速成长，说明了我国青年一代大有希望、大有作为，是能够担负起建设社会主义和共产主义的伟大使命的。
    我们的党，历来就是非常重视青年的革命作用的。毛泽东同志把青年比喻为早晨八九点钟的太阳，认为他们是整个社会力量中的最积极最有生气最肯学习最少保守思想的一部分力量。所以，作为人类社会的新生力量代表者的党，把教育青年一代，作为党的一项最重要的工作。广大青年也确实没有辜负党的希望。在每次革命的紧要关头，在每个新的战斗任务面前，我国青年特别是青年积极分子，总是首先响应了党的号召，奋不顾身地去从事革命斗争，并在从事实际的斗争中，不断地进行自我改造，不断地提高自己的共产主义觉悟。
    在建设社会主义和共产主义的伟大斗争中，培养和教育青年的工作是更加重要了。人是建设我们国家的决定因素。要建成社会主义和共产主义，就需要有“全新的人”。按照马克思、恩格斯和列宁的描绘，这种新人在政治上和思想上是纯洁而高尚的，他“无代价地为社会工作，不考虑每个人的差别，丝毫没有旧的观点，没有守旧心理、旧习气”。这种新人在学识和能力上也是完备的广博的，他是“具有全面知识的，受有全面训练的人，即能够作所有一切事情的人”。是什么人最有希望成为这样的人呢？毫无疑问，正是在党的直接教养下所成长起来的青年一代，正是共产主义精神不断昂扬的青年一代。在我国基本上实现了人民公社化以后，生产资料私有制的残余已经逐渐归于消灭，旧的不合理的家长制度正在被淘汰，资产阶级的法权思想已受到进一步的批判。这就意味着，历史上遗留下来的束缚青年的锁链即将彻底粉碎，从而为青年的全面的健全的生长开拓了广阔的天地。
    为着更快更好地把我国青年一代培养成为共产主义的新人，就必须继续引导青年积极参加全民的实际斗争，并在斗争中不断地加强社会主义和共产主义教育。当前在继续发展和巩固人民公社的斗争中，在以钢为纲的全民办工业的斗争中，在教育大改革的斗争中，在组织人民生活福利的斗争中，都必须放手使用青年的力量，充分发挥他们的积极性和创造精神，充分发挥他们的带头作用和突击作用。同时，我们各级党和团的组织在组织青年进行所有一切活动中，还必须尽心竭力地使各种活动都能收到培养和教育青年的功效，收到增长知识，锻炼能力，培养品德和增强体质的作用。在“苦战三年”的时期中，应当注意爱护和珍惜青年的积极性，把劳动和学习很好地结合起来，把苦战和休整很好地结合起来，继续实现毛主席的“身体好、学习好、工作好”的号召，充分发挥青年的积极作用，使青年获得全面的健康的成长，把他们培养成为红透专深的全面发展的共产主义的新一代。这是建设新社会和培养新人的统一的历史任务。
    出席这次大会的青年，已经为祖国为人民做出了一定的贡献。我们祝贺他们的成就。希望他们发扬不断革命的精神，虚心学习，永不骄傲，不断前进，不断取得新的成就。我们知道，积极分子是群众中的先进部分，积极分子是群众的好榜样，是群众运动中的骨干力量，是我们党领导群众和开展群众运动的依靠。积极分子带动群众前进，形成群众运动，群众运动又迅速地推动着社会前进，并且培养出更多的新的积极分子出来。这就是我们革命事业不断向前发展的规律。通过这次大会，必将进一步提高青年积极分子的共产主义觉悟，鼓舞全国广大青年更加奋发地向积极分子看齐。我们深信，这次大会一定能够完成自己的使命，在建设社会主义的群众运动中和培养共产主义新人的事业中，发生巨大的推动作用。
