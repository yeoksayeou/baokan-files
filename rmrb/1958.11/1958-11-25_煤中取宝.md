In the Shanghai Yangshupu Power Plant, coal is no longer just providing light and heat for people, but is also beginning to provide raw materials for the manufacture of fertilizers, dyes, perfumes, medicines, plastics, and building materials.

The factory's employees and their families, using their own homemade equipment and methods, have extracted coal tar and coal gas from coal dust; extracted alumina and rare metals from coal ash; and used coal ash to make cement, fire mud, refractory bricks, and sand soap.

The Yangshupu Power Plant is currently the largest thermal power plant in the country, and also one of the factories that consumes the most coal. For many years, the plant's production has been: coal enters the plant, and electricity leaves the plant, with no other products coming out. The amount of coal tar burned in the furnaces and the coal ash discarded as waste each year is unknown, but certainly tens of thousands of tons. In order to remove hundreds of tons of coal ash every day, the factory specially dispatched six large barges and a tugboat to undertake this task.

During the Great Leap Forward, someone calculated an account for this factory: as long as one-third of the coal is comprehensively utilized, it can produce 30,000 tons of coal tar, 400-500 tons of benzene, and tens of millions of cubic meters of coal gas every year in addition to generating electricity as usual. The factory's employees are determined not to let these valuable assets run away from the chimneys and furnace bottoms. They organized their families and used the factory's open space, old materials, and old equipment to establish a series of comprehensive utilization equipment such as cement kilns, fire brick kilns, fire mud workshops, and fluidized bed low-temperature carbonization furnaces.

The coal burned in this factory comes from various places, and the content of silicon, aluminum, iron, and volatile oil in the coal is different. The factory's workers conduct different comprehensive utilization based on the different components of the coal burned. For example, the coal from Huainan and Liying and other places has a high volatile oil content, so they use the coal dust of this kind of coal for low-temperature carbonization to extract about 12% of coal tar from the coal; the ash of Kailuan coal after burning contains more than 37% of alumina, so they use this coal ash to extract alumina; the ash of Xinqiu coal contains a high amount of iron, which is suitable for manufacturing high-quality cement, so they concentrate the ash and let the factory's employees and their families process and manufacture cement. Some coal ash is very fine, so they contacted rubber factories to make it a filler for rubber instead of calcium carbonate.

Comprehensive utilization of coal has just begun in this factory, and the equipment processing capacity is relatively small. It can only carbonize 50 tons of coal a day and can only process a small portion of coal ash. Based on the initial achievements, this factory plans to gradually transform itself into a comprehensive factory that can not only supply a large amount of electricity, but also produce a large amount of chemical raw materials and building materials.

Who would have thought that the raw material for these refractory bricks, which are in short supply in the market, would be coal ash? The workers of the Shanghai Yangshupu Power Plant used waste materials to build small brick kilns, each kiln can burn more than 1,300 coal ash refractory bricks, and can produce 13,000 pieces a day.

    煤中取宝
    在上海杨树浦发电厂里，煤已经不仅是为人们发出光和热，而且开始为人们提供制造肥料、染料、香料、药料、塑料和建筑材料的原料。
    这个厂的职工和他们的家属，用自己制造的土设备、土办法，已经从煤粉里抽取出煤焦油和煤气；从煤灰里提炼出氧化铝和稀有金属；用煤灰制成了水泥、火泥、耐火砖、砂肥皂。
    杨树浦发电厂是目前全国最大的火力发电厂，也是一个耗煤最多的工厂。多少年来，这个厂的生产一直是：进厂的是煤，出厂的是电，再没有其他产品出来。每年在炉子里烧掉的煤焦油和当废物倒掉的煤灰，不知有多少万吨。为了每天把成百吨煤灰清除出去，厂里特地派了六条大驳船和一艘拖轮来担负这项工作。
    大跃进中，有人给这个厂算了一笔账：只要有三分之一的煤实行综合利用，每年它除了照常发电以外，还可以生产出三万吨煤焦油，四、五百吨苯，成千万立方公尺煤气。厂里的职工决心不让这些宝贵的财富从烟囱里、炉底下跑掉。他们把家属组织起来，利用厂里的空地、旧料和旧设备，建立了水泥窑、火砖窑、火泥车间和流动床低温干馏炉等一系列的综合利用设备。
    这个厂烧的煤来自各地，煤里含的矽、铝、铁和挥发油等成分各不相同。厂里的工人根据不同成分的燃煤，进行不同的综合利用。如淮南和李郢等地来的煤挥发油含量高，他们就用这种煤的煤粉进行低温干馏，从煤里抽出12％左右的煤焦油来；开滦煤烧过的灰氧化铝成份占37％以上，他们就用这种煤灰提炼氧化铝；新丘煤的灰里含铁量高，适宜于制造优质水泥，他们就把灰集中起来，由职工家属加工制造水泥。有些煤灰很细，他们就与橡胶厂联系，使它代替炭酸钙做了橡胶的填充剂。
    燃煤综合利用在这个厂还刚刚开始，设备加工能力比较小，一天只能干馏五十吨煤，只能处理一小部分煤灰。这个厂打算在取得初步成就的基础上，争取逐步使自己工厂成为既能供应大量电力，又能生产大量化工原料和建筑材料的综合性工厂。（附图片）
    谁也想不到这些市场上供不应求的耐火砖的原料竟是煤灰。上海杨树浦发电厂职工们用废旧料建成小砖窑，每窑可烧一千三百多块煤灰耐火砖，每日可生产一万三千块。　新华社记者　夏道陵摄
