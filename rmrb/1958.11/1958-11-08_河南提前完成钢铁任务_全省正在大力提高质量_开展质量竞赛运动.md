Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 7th: In October, the people of Henan wrote a heroic chapter in China's steel leap forward. In that month, they produced a total of 4.4 million tons of pig iron. Adding this to the pig iron produced before the end of September, the province has produced a total of 4.68 million tons of iron this year. In that month, 300,000 tons of steel were produced. Adding this to the cumulative production from January to September, the province has produced a total of 313,000 tons of steel this year. Thus, Henan has completed its steel production tasks for this year ahead of schedule and exceeding the target. At the end of June, the province only produced a few thousand tons of iron; there was no steel production at all. In mid-July, the mass mobilization was not yet large in scale, and the progress was not fast, with only a few hundred tons of iron produced per day. On September 15th, the first satellite of more than 18,000 tons of pig iron production per day was launched. In the last three days of the month, large-scale bumper harvests were achieved continuously, with more than 130,000 tons of iron produced in three days. Entering October, the depth and breadth of the mass mobilization in the province exceeded any previous period. The various large and small indigenous iron smelting furnaces put into production reached more than 400,000, and the broad masses, through production practice, comprehensively broke through the technical barriers. The leaders also gained a set of experience in organizing production. A comprehensive leap forward with steel as the center has emerged throughout the province.

The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a telephone conference of secretaries of local municipal committees, preliminarily summarized the experience of organizing steel production in October, and arranged the tasks of producing 800,000 tons of iron, 400,000 tons of steel, and 30,000 tons of steel products in November. At present, all localities are further mobilizing the masses to vigorously improve quality on the basis of increasing quantity, launching a quality competition campaign, storing large amounts of ore, fuel and other materials, making full preparations for winter production, accelerating the construction of foreign furnaces and key projects, and advancing towards specialized teams, factory-style mass furnaces, furnace grouping, production base building, and people's communes based on these production areas.

    河南提前完成钢铁任务
    全省正在大力提高质量　开展质量竞赛运动
    据新华社郑州7日电　在10月份里，河南人民为我国钢铁跃进写下了英雄的史篇。他们在这月一共生产出生铁四百四十万吨，如果加上9月底以前生产的生铁，今年全省已经产铁四百六十八万吨；这月产钢三十万吨，加上1至9月份的累计产量，今年全省已经产钢三十一万三千吨。至此，河南今年生产钢铁的任务，都已提前超额完成。6月底，全省只产铁几千吨；钢一吨也没有。7月中旬，群众发动规模还不大，进度也不快，每天只能产铁几百吨。在9月15日首次放出了日产生铁一万八千多吨的卫星，在这月的最后三天又连续取得了大面积丰产，三天产铁十三万多吨。进入10月份，全省群众发动的深度和广度都超过了以往任何时候，投入生产的各种大小土炼铁炉，达到了四十多万座，广大群众并且通过生产实践，全面地突破了技术关，领导也取得了一套组织生产的经验。全省已出现了以钢铁为中心的全面大跃进的局面。
    中共河南省委在最近召开的各地市委书记电话会议上，初步总结了10月份组织钢铁生产的经验，并且布置了11月份产铁八十万吨、产钢四十万吨、钢材三万吨的任务。目前各地正进一步发动群众在提高数量的基础上大力提高质量，开展质量竞赛运动，储存大量的矿石、燃料和其他物资，为冬季生产作好充分的准备，加快洋炉子和重点工程的建设速度，并向着队伍专业化、群炉工厂化、炉子成组化、生产基地化和基地人民公社化前进。
