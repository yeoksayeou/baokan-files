    The Secret of Gems
    Mi Yang
    Gems are not only beautiful ornaments, but also have great uses in industry. Because they are hard and wear-resistant, they can be widely used as bearings in precision instruments, such as in the watches and electric meters we are familiar with.
    Not long ago, a good gem was much more expensive than a diamond! But once people discovered the secret of gems, their value was no longer so high. Now they can be produced almost by the ton in factories. In the past, our country could not manufacture artificial gems. During the Great Leap Forward, comrades at the Institute of Applied Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences successfully trial-produced them in a very short time.
    So-called gems are just transparent crystals of some metal oxides. The most common is aluminum oxide crystals. A very precious one called emerald is a mixed crystal of beryllium oxide and aluminum oxide.
    Ordinary aluminum oxide is in powder form. To turn it into large, transparent crystals, the powder must first be melted and then the melt must be crystallized. The specific method is: blowing extremely fine pure aluminum oxide powder, mixed with hydrogen and oxygen in a certain ratio, into a special furnace and igniting it. At high temperatures above two thousand degrees, the powder quickly turns into a molten mass. At the same time, the focal point of the flame is aimed at a support, on which a small gem is placed in advance as a seed crystal. Then, the melted aluminum oxide gradually crystallizes around this seed crystal and grows larger. Slowly move the support away, and the gem can grow into a rod shape. Slightly changing the equipment can also produce larger gems, shaped like a solid wine glass. The gems made in this way are colorless and transparent.
    It is not difficult to make various colored gems. Just mix a small amount of other compounds evenly into the aluminum oxide. For example, mixing some chromium compounds will produce rubies, mixing some cobalt will produce sapphires, and mixing some vanadium compounds will produce gems that appear yellow and green under sunlight and lamplight.
    If some titanium compounds are mixed into the aluminum oxide, the refractive index of the gem will be greatly enhanced. If pure titanium oxide is used to make gems, they will be even more dazzling than diamonds. This gem is also called rutile.
    The rod-shaped or wine glass-shaped gems obtained above are cut and polished into practical gems.

    宝石的秘密
    米扬
    宝石不但可以作美丽的装饰品，而且在工业上有着很大的用途。因为它坚硬耐磨，能够被广泛地用作精密仪表的轴承。如用在我们所熟知的手表和电表中等。
    不久以前，一颗好的宝石比金刚钻还贵得多哩！可是人们一旦发现了宝石的秘密，它的身价就不再那么高昂了，现在在工厂中几乎能成吨地生产它们。以往我国是不能制造人造宝石的，大跃进中，中国科学院应用物理研究所的同志们以极少的时间就试制成功了。
    所谓宝石，不过是一些金属氧化物的透明结晶体而已。最常见的是氧化铝的结晶。一种极名贵的称为全绿宝石的，则是氧化铍和氧化铝的混合结晶体。
    通常的氧化铝都是粉末状的。要把它变成大块的透明晶体，首先要将粉末熔化，然后使熔块结晶。具体办法是：将极细的纯氧化铝粉末和按一定比例混合的氢气和氧气一起吹到一个特制的炉中，并且把它点燃，在二千度以上的高温下，粉末迅速地变成熔块。同时将火焰的焦点对准在一个支座上，支座上预先放一颗小的宝石作为子晶（晶体的种子），于是被熔化了的氧化铝就围绕着这颗子晶逐渐结晶并长大了。慢慢地移开支座，就可以使宝石长成一根杆的形状。稍为改变一下设备也可以制成更粗大的宝石，形状像个实心的酒杯。这样制成的宝石是无色透明的。
    要制成各种有颜色的宝石也不困难。只要在氧化铝中混匀少许其他化合物就行了。例如混些铬的化合物就制成了红宝石，混些钴就制成蓝宝石，混些钒的化合物后制成的宝石在日光和灯光下呈现黄色和绿色。
    在氧化铝中如果混些钛的化合物，便会使宝石的折光性大为加强，如果用纯的氧化钛来制造宝石，就会比金刚钻还要光彩夺目，这种宝石又叫金红石。
    将以上制得的杆状或酒杯状的宝石加以琢磨就成了实用的宝石了。
