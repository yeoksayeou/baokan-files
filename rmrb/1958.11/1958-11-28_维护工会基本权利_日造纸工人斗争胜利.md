Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 27th: The Prince Paper Manufacturing Company union in Japan has ended its 130-day strike victoriously, shattering the Japanese monopoly capital's conspiracy to destroy union organizations and workers' solidarity.

The company authorities and the union accepted the mediation proposal put forward by the Central Labor Committee on November 22nd and 25th, respectively. This mediation proposal basically recognized the union's advocacy of the union shop system (i.e., the system where workers entering the factory must join the union).

The 4,500 workers of Prince Paper Manufacturing Company, one of Japan's largest paper companies, launched a struggle on February 28th this year to demand higher wages from the management. By May, not only did the management fail to meet the workers' demands for wage increases, but they also demanded that the union revise the labor agreement concluded with the management and insisted on changing the union shop system to an open shop system (i.e., a system where non-union members can also work in the factory). This was an attempt to deprive the workers of their rights and restrict union activities in order to undermine the union's struggle.

Since then, the fundamental nature of the struggle has changed to become a fierce struggle to defend the basic rights of the union. The union then announced an indefinite strike on July 18th.

With the active support of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), the Japan Federation of Pulp Industry Workers' Unions, the Japan Coal Miners' Union, the National Railway Workers' Union, the Hokkaido Trade Union Council, the Aichi Prefecture Trade Union Council, and many unions and workers in various regions, the workers of the Prince Paper Manufacturing Company union waged a resolute and heroic long-term struggle. The frantic suppression and despicable divisive conspiracies of the Kishi Nobusuke government and the monopoly capitalists were unsuccessful. In the united and resolute struggle of the workers, the management lost 1 billion yen and finally had to be forced to accept the mediation proposal. The victory of the Prince Paper Manufacturing Company union's struggle has greatly encouraged the current Japanese workers' movement.

    维护工会基本权利
    日造纸工人斗争胜利
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本王子制纸工业公司工会进行了为期一百三十天的罢工，粉碎了日本垄断资本破坏工会组织和工人团结的阴谋，终于胜利地结束了斗争。
    公司当局和工会分别在11月22日和25日接受了中央劳动委员会提出的调停案。这个调停案基本上承认了工会主张的工会工厂制（即进厂工作的工人必须参加工会的制度）。
    日本最大的造纸公司之一的王子制纸工业公司的四千五百名工人，在今年2月28日为了要求资方提高工资，开始进行了斗争。到了5月，资方不但没有满足工人增加工资的要求，反而要求工会修改同资方缔结的劳动协定，并且硬要把工会工厂制改为开放工厂制（即非工会会员也可以在厂里工作的制度）。企图剥夺工人的权利和限制工会的活动，以便破坏工会的斗争。
    从此，这个斗争的基本性质一变而成为维护工会基本权利的激烈的斗争。工会于是在7月18日宣布举行无限期罢工。
    王子制纸工业公司工会的工人，在日本工会总评议会、全国纸浆产业工会联合会、日本煤矿工会、国营铁道工会和北海道工会协议会、爱知县工会协议会以及各地区的许多工会和工人积极支援下，进行了坚决的、英勇的长期斗争。岸信介政府和垄断资本家的疯狂镇压和卑劣的分裂阴谋都没有得逞，在工人们团结一致的坚决斗争中，资方损失了十亿日元，最后还是不得不被迫接受调停案。王子制纸工业公司工会斗争的胜利，对于目前日本工人运动起了很大的鼓舞作用。
