Singing and Dancing Solidify Friendship
Deputy Head of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Song and Dance Troupe, Liu Ruzhou

    As the curtain rose at the Capital Theater, and the crimson velvet curtains slowly parted, I couldn't contain the excitement in my heart. Because the Korean artists who had just bid us farewell at the Moranbong in Pyongyang were now meeting us, as our honored guests, in our great capital of Beijing. Seeing those familiar faces, those warm smiles, I couldn't help but shout: Welcome, welcome, welcome to our dearest comrades!
    Watching the brilliant performances of the Korean visiting art troupe, just as we had every time we saw their performances in Korea, we were deeply infected by their artistic charm. Our hearts beat with the melodious singing and beautiful dancing, immersed in the joy of Sino-Korean friendship.
    Watching the dance "Encounter on the Heights," which depicts the Chinese and Korean armies fighting side by side, it was as if we had returned to the smoke-filled, war-torn battlefield. During those arduous years of war, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army displayed a high degree of internationalism, cooperating and supporting each other. The soldiers shed their blood together, defeated our common enemy, and won our common victory. When the Korean flag and the red flag of the Volunteer Army were waved alternately on the stage, the hearts of the Chinese and Korean people were also intimately merged. Through the artists' passionate and militant dance movements, we recalled so many simple faces of the Korean People's Army comrades, and so many moving stories of the Korean people supporting our Chinese People's Volunteer Army with their blood!
    When we heard the Korean artists sing in high and clear voices, "We must plant the red flag in Taiwan," our hearts were filled with indescribable gratitude. Yes, Taiwan is our territory, and we must liberate Taiwan! Listening to your singing, we seem to see behind our 600 million people, tens of thousands, billions, and billions of Koreans, Vietnamese, Mongolians, Soviets, everyone in the socialist family, and all peace-loving people around the world supporting our just struggle! Dear Korean comrades, please believe that just as you support us, all the people of China, and all the people of the world, are also supporting your just struggle to complete unification!
    After watching your dances "Iron Water Gushing" and "Celebrating the Harvest," we thought of the many large-scale factories you quickly restored and built after the war, and the well-fed and clothed farms full of happy scenes. In the past eight years, we have deeply known that the heroic Korean people are not only brave and tenacious, able to defeat any powerful enemy and defend the independence and freedom of their motherland, but also how hardworking and kind they are. We have personally witnessed them building their beautiful lives on the ruins of war with their working hands. Now, under the leadership of Comrade Kim Il-sung, they have embarked on the Chollima and are galloping towards a happier tomorrow! Korean artists were the encouragers of the victory in the Fatherland Liberation War in the past, and today they are the encouragers of socialist construction. Comrade Kim Il-sung once praised you: "Like Korea's industrial and agricultural construction, the art cause has also embarked on the Chollima," this is the honor you deserve for your hard work. Your style of serving politics through art, going deep into factories, farms, and closely connecting with the masses has set a brilliant example for us to learn from.
    We deeply know that the Korean people are good at singing and dancing and have a high degree of revolutionary optimism. Korean artists have inherited this glorious national tradition and continue to develop it. Many classical and folk songs and dances, through the hard work of Korean artists, have bloomed with brilliant and luxuriant flowers year after year. The beautiful and nationally characteristic "Fan Dance," "Sword Dance," and the elegant strings of the ancient Gayageum have all enjoyed high international fame. In this performance, we believe that whether politically or artistically, it will bring the greatest satisfaction to the Chinese audience.
    Dear comrades, each of your programs is so highly successful. In the difficult days of the past, you used these programs to tour our Volunteer Army companies and tunnels, encouraging the soldiers to march and fight; today, you have come to our motherland, and through your performances, you will surely add new glory to Sino-Korean cultural exchange and the battle friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, forged in blood!

    轻歌曼舞凝友谊
    志愿军文工团副团长　刘汝舟
    当首都剧场打响了开幕钟，紫红色的丝绒帏幕缓缓地拉开时，我怎么也抑制不住内心的激动。因为，刚刚和我们在平壤牡丹峰下告别的朝鲜艺术家们，今天又作为我们尊贵的客人，在我们伟大的首都北京会见了。看见那些熟悉的面孔，亲切的笑容，我禁不住要高呼：欢迎，欢迎，欢迎我们最亲爱的战友！
    看了朝鲜访华艺术团的精彩演出，像过去在朝鲜每一次看到他们的演出一样，我们深深地被他们的艺术魅力所感染。我们的心随着婉转的歌声、美妙的舞姿在跳动，浸沉在中朝友谊的欢欣里。
    观看以描写中朝军队并肩作战为主题的舞蹈“高地相逢”，我们就像回到了那烟硝弥漫、炮火纷飞的战场。在那艰苦的战争岁月里，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，发挥了高度的国际主义精神，互相配合，互相支援。战士们把鲜血流在一起，打败了我们共同的敌人，争取了我们共同的胜利。当舞台上朝鲜国旗和志愿军的红旗交叉挥舞的时候，中朝人民的心也亲密无间地溶合在一起了。通过艺术家们感情奔放、富有战斗性的舞蹈动作，使我们回忆起多少人民军同志的纯朴的面孔，又使我们回忆起多少朝鲜人民用鲜血支援我们中国人民志愿军的动人故事啊！
    当我们听到朝鲜艺术家们以高吭嘹亮的歌喉，唱出“一定要把红旗插在台湾”的时候，我们内心里充满着难以描述的感激之情。是的，台湾是我国的领土，我们一定要解放台湾！听了你们的歌声，我们仿佛看到在我国六亿人民的背后，有着成千上万，几亿、几十亿的朝鲜人、越南人、蒙古人、苏联人、社会主义大家庭所有的人，全世界爱好和平的人们，都在支持着我们的正义斗争！亲爱的朝鲜战友，请你们相信：也像你们支持我们一样，全中国的人民，全世界的人民也都在支持着你们为完成统一而进行的正义斗争！
    看完你们的“铁水奔流”、“庆丰收”等舞蹈，我们就想起了你们在战后迅速恢复和新建的许多规模宏大的工厂，以及丰衣足食充满着幸福景象的农庄。在过去的八年中，我们深深地知道，英雄的朝鲜人民不但勇敢、顽强，能战胜任何强大的敌人，捍卫自己祖国的独立和自由，而且他们又多么勤劳和善良。我们曾亲眼看到，他们用劳动的双手，在战后的废墟上建立起自己美好的生活。如今又在金日成同志的领导下，跨上了千里马，向着更加幸福的明天奔驰！朝鲜的艺术家们过去是争取卫国战争胜利的鼓舞者，今天又是社会主义建设的鼓舞者，金日成同志曾嘉奖过你们：“像朝鲜的工农业建设一样，艺术事业也跨上了千里马”，这是你们刻苦的劳动所应得的荣誉。你们艺术为政治服务、深入工厂、农庄和群众密切联系的作风，为我们树立了光辉的学习榜样。
    我们深深地知道：朝鲜人民善歌善舞，具有高度革命乐观主义的精神。朝鲜的艺术家们继承了这个光辉的民族传统，并不断地发展了它。许多古典的和民间的歌舞，经过朝鲜艺术家们的辛勤劳动，年复一年地放出了灿烂繁茂的花朵。优美的富有民族特点的“扇舞”、“剑舞”和古老的伽耶琴的清雅的弦声，都曾享有崇高的国际声名。在此次的演出中，我们相信：不论在政治上、还是在艺术上，都会给中国观众带来最大的满足。
    亲爱的战友们，你们的每一个节目，都是那样高度的成功，过去，在艰难的日子里，你们曾以这些节目，到我们志愿军连队、坑道中作巡回演出，鼓舞战士们行军作战；今天，你们来到了我们的祖国，通过你们的表演，也定会在中朝文化交流和中朝人民以鲜血凝成的战斗友谊上，增添新的光辉！（附图片）
