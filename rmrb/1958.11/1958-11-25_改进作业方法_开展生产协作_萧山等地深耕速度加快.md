Improving Operational Methods and Developing Production Collaboration
Xiaoshan and Other Places Speed Up Deep Plowing
(According to Zhejiang Daily) Xiaoshan County's people's communes have broken through township and commune boundaries to carry out large-scale production collaboration, with 20,000 supporting troops rushing to engage in deep plowing and winter planting.

In order to ensure that deep plowing and sowing in rice-growing areas do not miss the season, the Xiaoshan County Party Committee held a telephone conference of party committee secretaries of various communes on October 4, putting forward the call to support rice-growing areas with sandy land, support rural areas with towns, support plains with mountainous areas, and rush to complete the sowing task of 180,000 mu. After the meeting, the people's communes in various cotton and hemp areas, while organizing the rush harvest of cotton and hemp, also arranged labor to support the rice areas. After calculating the labor needs for large and small wheat cultivation, winter water conservancy construction, and fine hemp washing, the Universe Red People's Commune extracted 3,000 laborers, forming two battalions and seven companies. The first batch of 1,500 people, with ten rope-traction machines, iron harrows, and other tillage tools, rushed to the Chengdong and Chengnan communes on the 9th to provide support. The Heshang People's Commune once had 468 laborers and 204 head of cattle to support the Chengbei People's Commune. This time, the Chengbei People's Commune in turn extracted more than 800 laborers to support the Heshang People's Commune in deep plowing paddy fields. Under this kind of collaboration, the deep plowing task of Heshang Commune was quickly completed by 70%. The Linpu Iron and Steel Plant specially established a sand turning workshop, worked hard for four days, and manufactured more than 2,500 deep plowing plows to support the communes in deep plowing the land. Supply and marketing cooperatives sent cadres to help cotton and hemp areas pack cotton and hemp.

At present, there are more than 13,000 laborers in the county who have been put into supporting deep plowing and winter planting. This vigorous atmosphere of collaboration has accelerated the pace of autumn harvest and winter planting. As of the 10th, 410,000 mu of the county's 450,000 mu deep plowed land task had been completed.

(According to Jilin Daily) In the deep plowing work of the Songjiang Management Area of the Hongqi People's Commune in Songjiang Township, Fusong County, Jilin, although the commune members had sufficient enthusiasm, the deep plowing efficiency was not high due to the limitations of the plowing method, which only used shovels and hoes. On November 8, 78 commune members, including 25 female commune members, only dug 7.3 li of land in one day and applied 45 carts of layered fertilizer, reaching only about 2.7 chi deep. At this rate, the task of deep plowing more than three chi in the entire management area could not be completed in another month. Based on this situation, they held a cadre meeting and mobilized the masses to come up with ideas. Finally, they learned a method of combining human and animal power with assembly line operations from other places. This method is: first, people use hoes to break open the frozen soil layer on the ground, then use two oxen to pull a plough to turn the soil. After the first plough is turned, people use shovels to move the turned soil to the side. Then break the second plough soil next to the first plough ditch, and then go over the first plough again. Then move the turned soil with a shovel to the side. Break the third plough soil next to the second plough, then go over the first and second ploughs each once, and move the soil turned over by the second plough to the side. In this way, ploughing three ploughs in a row, the soil layers are not disordered, and the depth reaches more than three chi.

The first team of this management area used this method, using only 25 people (including 6 female commune members), and plowed more than 7.8 li of land in one day, which was more than what 78 people plowed in one day, increasing efficiency by more than two times. In this way, the deep plowing task can be completed in more than ten days. After the General Branch of the Communist Party of China in Songjiang Township discovered this experience, it immediately held an on-site meeting attended by cadres from various management areas and promoted this method of combining human and animal power with assembly line operations. After everyone's appraisal, it was unanimously agreed that this method saves labor, ploughs deeper, and ploughs faster. After the meeting, all localities mobilized the masses overnight and adopted this method to carry out plowing.

    改进作业方法　开展生产协作
    萧山等地深耕速度加快
    据浙江日报消息　萧山县各人民公社突破乡界社界开展生产大协作，二万名支援大军突击投入深耕冬种。
    为了保证水稻地区深耕播种不误季节，萧山县委于10月4日召开了各公社党委书记电话会议，提出了沙地支援水稻地区、城镇支援农村、山区支援平原，突击完成十八万亩播种任务的号召。会后，各棉麻区的人民公社在组织抢收棉麻的同时，也安排出劳力支援稻区。宇宙红人民公社计算了大、小麦培育和冬修水利、精洗络麻等方面的劳力需要账后，抽出三千个劳动力编成两个营、七个连，第一批一千五百人，带着十部绳索牵引机、铁耙等翻耕工具，9日赶到了城东、城南两个公社去支援。河上人民公社曾经有四百六十八个劳力、二百零四头耕牛支援过城北人民公社，这一回，城北人民公社转回头抽了八百多个劳力支援河上人民公社深翻水田了。在这种协作之下，河上公社深翻任务迅速完成70％。临浦炼铁厂专门成立了翻砂车间，苦战四天，制造了二千五百多部深耕犁，支援公社深翻土地。供销社派出干部帮助棉麻区包扎棉麻。
    目前，全县投入支援深耕冬种的有一万三千多个劳动力。这种旺盛的协作风气，加快了秋收冬种的速度。全县四十五万亩深翻土地任务，到10日止，已完成四十一万亩。
    据吉林日报消息　吉林抚松县松江乡红旗人民公社松江管理区，在深翻工作中，虽然社员干劲足，但是由于翻地方法的限制，只用锹挖，镐头刨，深翻效率总是不高。11月8日，七十八名社员，其中女社员二十五名，一天只挖了七分三厘地，分层施肥四十五车，仅达到二尺七寸左右深。按这个速度，全管理区的深翻三尺以上的任务，再有一个月也不能完成。他们根据这种情况，召开了干部会议，发动群众，大家想办法，最后从外地学来了人畜结合流水作业法。这个方法是：先由人把地面冻土层刨开，然后用两头牛拉一付犁杖翻，第一犁翻过后，接着人工用锹把翻的土移到旁边。然后挨着头一犁的沟破第二犁土，接着把第一犁再趟一遍，再把翻的土用锹移到旁边。挨着第二犁破第三犁土，再把一、二犁各趟一犁，第二犁翻过的土移到旁边，这样依次翻下去，连翻三犁，土层不乱，深度达三尺以上。
    这个管理区的第一队用这种办法，只用二十五个人（其中六个女社员），一天就翻地七分八厘多，比七十八个人一天翻的还多，提高效率二倍多。这样，有十多天就能完成深翻任务。中共松江乡总支发现这一经验后，便立即召开有各管理区干部参加的现场会议，推广了这种人畜结合流水作业方法。经过大家的鉴定，一致认为这个办法省工、翻得深、翻得快。散会后，各地连夜发动群众，采用这办法进行翻地。
