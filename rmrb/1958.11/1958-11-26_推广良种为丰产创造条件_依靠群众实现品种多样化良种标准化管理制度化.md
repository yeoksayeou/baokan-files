Promoting Superior Varieties Creates Conditions for High Yields
Relying on the Masses to Achieve Variety Diversification, Superior Variety Standardization, and Management Systematization

    (By Our Staff Reporter) The Seed Management Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture recently studied the great leap forward in seed work in 1958 and the practices of seed work after the people's communes. The Seed Bureau believes that with the great leap forward in agricultural production, this year's seed work has achieved unprecedented development. The national planting area of improved varieties has reached 1.8 billion mu, an increase of more than 500 million mu compared with 1957. Provinces such as Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Jiangsu, and Fujian have basically popularized improved varieties. According to incomplete statistics from seventeen provinces and regions, there are already more than 500 counties and cities with improved varieties, and the national estimate is more than 800. More than 1,200 excellent varieties were promoted in 1958, and more than 200 new varieties have been bred and can be preliminarily promoted. These have fully prepared the conditions for the national improvement of varieties in 1959.

    The Seed Bureau also studied the work of regional variety identification and seed testing. It believes that these tasks, which were previously regarded as highly scientific and technical and could only be done by scientific research institutions or technicians, have also been mastered by the masses this year, and have been done quickly and well. In particular, the work of breeding new varieties has broken through the gates of scientific research institutions this year, forming a mass movement. A large number of farmer breeders have emerged across the country, and they have carried out a large amount of variety hybridization work. The new varieties of rice from distant hybridization have reached four to five hundred grains per ear, and each plant can produce half a catty of grain, creating an unprecedented miracle in history. These achievements have opened up broad avenues for future seed science and technology revolution.

    After the establishment of people's communes, how should seed work be carried out? The Seed Bureau analyzed the conditions of the people's communes, such as large populations, strong forces, concentrated land, and the combination of administration and production, and also analyzed the characteristics of the people's communes' needs for seeds. It believes that the goals of "variety diversification, superior variety standardization, and management systematization" put forward by some regions, and the direction of carrying out mass movements, letting a hundred flowers bloom, and bringing forth new ideas in seed work, are very correct. They should be universally promoted and resolutely implemented nationwide in 1959.

    The Bureau believes that the key to achieving the above indicators lies in the establishment of a comprehensive organization and management system by the people's communes. According to the preliminary experience of various places, the people's commune can establish a seed committee under the agricultural department to be responsible for overall leadership. The seed committee can set up a seed section (station), a specialized agency, and full-time personnel to specifically control the breeding, identification, propagation, selection, retention, inspection, and storage of improved varieties throughout the commune. The commune can also establish an improved variety propagation farm, responsible for conducting variety trials, regional adaptability identification, and propagating original seeds or advanced seeds; each brigade (work area) can also select a production team as a seed professional team, responsible for propagating various crop seeds for the entire brigade and conducting some production trials. The commune can also establish a seed testing laboratory and a dedicated seed warehouse. It can also launch a seed selection and seed contribution movement among the members in each crop harvest season to continuously open up sources of improved varieties.

    The Seed Management Bureau believes that the current seed work should first emphasize the proper storage of this year's autumn harvest seeds. The seeds harvested this autumn are generally diverse in variety and large in quantity, and some areas have high moisture content at harvest time, so they must be carefully dried and stored separately by variety to prevent mixing, mildew, and other losses. The people's commune should promptly formulate a set of storage measures, assign special personnel to be responsible, and contract until the seeds are released for sowing next year. Second, make comprehensive plans. The people's commune should determine the scale and zoning of improved variety propagation farms, professional teams, etc., based on long-term plans, combined with next year's production plans and the commune's land conditions. Third, make specific preparations. The seeds to be used next year should be fully prepared according to the plan, and those that are insufficient should be exchanged and supplemented, and those that are not good should be selected, retained, and exchanged to ensure that every seed sown next year is an improved variety.

### 推广良种为丰产创造条件  依靠群众实现品种多样化良种标准化管理制度化

    推广良种为丰产创造条件
    依靠群众实现品种多样化良种标准化管理制度化
    本报讯　农业部种子管理局最近研究了1958年种子工作大跃进的情况和人民公社化以后的种子工作作法。种子局认为：随着农业生产的大跃进，今年的种子工作获得了空前未有的大发展。全国良种种植面积已达十八亿亩，比1957年增加五亿多亩。黑龙江、辽宁、江苏、福建等省良种已基本普及。良种化的县、市据十七省区不完全统计已有五百多个，全国估计达八百个以上。1958年推广的优良品种有一千二百多种，新育成并且可以初步推广的良种还有二百多种。这些都为1959年全国良种化准备了充分的条件。
    种子局还研究了品种区域鉴定、种子检验等工作。认为这些过去一向看成科学技术性高，只有科学研究机关或技术人员才能做的工作，今年也为群众所掌握了，并且做得很快、很好。特别是培育新品种工作，今年冲破了科学研究机构的大门，形成了群众运动。全国涌现出成批的农民育种家，他们进行了大量的品种杂交工作。远缘杂交的水稻新品种每穗达四、五百粒，每株可产谷半斤，创造了历史上未有的奇迹。这些成就为今后种子科学技术革命开辟了广阔的道路。
    人民公社化以后，种子工作怎样进行呢？种子局分析了人民公社人多、力量大、土地集中、行政生产结合等条件，还分析了人民公社对种子需要的特点。它认为，有些地区提出的“品种多样化、良种标准化、管理制度化”的目标，和种子工作中的大搞群众运动、百花齐放、推陈出新的方向，是十分正确的。1959年应当在全国范围普遍推行坚决贯彻。
    该局认为：实现上述指标的关键，在于人民公社建立一套完善的组织和管理制度。根据目前各地的初步经验：人民公社在农业部门下可成立种子委员会，负责全面领导。种子委员会下可设种子股（站）专门机构和专职人员，具体掌握全公社的良种培育、鉴定、繁殖、选留、检验、保管等工作。公社还可以建立良种繁殖场，负责进行品种试验、区域适应性鉴定，繁育原种或高级种子；每个大队（作业区）还可选择一个生产队为种子专业队，负责繁殖整个大队用的各种作物种子，并进行一些生产试验。公社还可以成立种子检验室和建立专用的种子仓库。还可以在每一作物收获季节，发动社员开展选种、献种运动，不断开辟良种来源。
    种子管理局认为：当前的种子工作，首先应当强调把今年秋收的种子保管好。今年秋收的种子，一般是品种多、数量大，加上有些地区收获时水份高，因此必须认真晒干，并分品种储存，防止混杂、霉烂等损失。人民公社应当及时制订一套保管办法，责成专人负责，包干到明年出仓播种。其次是作出全面规划。人民公社应当根据长远规划、结合明年生产计划和本社土地条件等确定良种繁殖场、专业队等的规模和区划。第三，具体进行准备。明年用的种子应根据计划充分准备，不够的串换补足，不好的选留调换。以保证明年播下的种子，粒粒都是良种。
