Comprehensive Prevention and Control, Combining Native and Foreign Methods, Complete Elimination, Focus on Eradication
Eliminate Eleven Major Pests and Diseases Next Year
730 Counties and Cities Nationwide Eliminate One or Several Pests and Diseases
    (Report from this newspaper) Marching toward the complete annihilation of major crop pests and diseases. The National Plant Protection Work Conference, which concluded on the 20th, discussed, with this goal in mind, launching a comprehensive annihilation campaign nationwide in 1959 with the spirit of eliminating the four pests, thoroughly eradicating the eleven major pests and diseases (as stipulated in the Agricultural Development Program) and major local pests and diseases, and striving to plant red flags of pest and disease-free areas all over the country.

    The National Plant Protection Work Conference was convened by the Ministry of Agriculture. More than 100 representatives from 27 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, as well as relevant central departments, participated in the conference.

    After thorough discussion, the conference determined the guiding principle for plant protection work next year as: "Comprehensive prevention and control, combining native and foreign methods, complete elimination, focus on eradication." According to the requirements of this principle, the plant protection work next year will be based on this year's great victory to comprehensively eliminate the major pest and disease hazards of various crops. It is not only necessary to eliminate pests and diseases in farmland, but also to advance into mountainous and pastoral areas; it is not only necessary to eliminate pests and diseases in grain and cotton, but also to eliminate pests and diseases in fruit trees, vegetables, oil crops, hemp, tobacco, tea, and other crops; it is not only necessary to eliminate pests and diseases, but also to eliminate harmful birds and animals. All kinds of crops must achieve four protections and four guarantees. The four protections are: "Protect from cultivation to sowing, from sowing to green growth, from green growth to ripening, and from ripening to storage." The four guarantees are: guarantee seedlings, guarantee plants, guarantee ears, and guarantee grains.

    The conference stipulated the tasks for next year as: First, to thoroughly eliminate eleven types of pest and disease hazards nationwide, including locusts, rice stem borers, armyworms, corn borers, cotton aphids, cotton red spiders, cotton bollworms, wheat gall midges, wheat smut, wheat nematode disease, sweet potato black rot, and major local crop pests and diseases. Second, each province, city, and autonomous region should eradicate one to several pests and diseases and create more counties completely free from pests and diseases.

    The conference pointed out that it is possible to complete the above tasks in the coming year. The favorable conditions are that the work of preventing and controlling pests and diseases is one of the eight-point "Constitution" for agriculture, which will attract more attention from various regions. At the same time, the completion and consolidation of people's communes, the increasing communist consciousness of the masses, deep plowing of land this winter and next spring, especially the glorious example of about one-third of the counties and cities nationwide having basically eliminated one or several pests and diseases, are all unprecedentedly favorable conditions. The conference also pointed out that the tasks for next year are arduous and that it is necessary to continue to oppose right-leaning conservatism, further boost energy, strengthen leadership, and make comprehensive arrangements in order to fully utilize favorable conditions and overcome all difficulties in the work. According to the successful experience of pest and disease control this year, it is necessary for the secretaries to take action, put politics in command, launch mass movements on a large scale; while grasping ideology, grasping organization, grasping on-site visits to promote progress, and grasping medicines and machinery, it is also necessary to rely on the broad masses to grasp pest information, grasp the laws of pest occurrence and development, seize crucial opportunities, and launch annihilation campaigns in a planned, organized, and step-by-step manner.

    In order to complete the tasks for next year, the conference also required all regions to immediately start producing native pesticides and native machinery on a large scale. The conference emphasized: Eliminating all overwintering pests and diseases is a very important task currently in all regions. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly launch the prevention and control of overwintering pests and diseases and fire the first shot in the complete annihilation of major pests and diseases next year.

    (Report from this newspaper) This year, an unprecedented victory was won on the plant protection front. The area treated for various pests and diseases nationwide was 1.7 times larger than last year; about one-third of the counties and cities have basically eliminated one or several major pests and diseases, playing a significant role in ensuring an unprecedented bumper harvest in agriculture.

    Due to abnormal temperatures in many areas, various crop pests and diseases occurred earlier and covered a wider area this year than last year; wheat rust and oriental armyworm, which occur on a large scale every few years, were much more serious than last year. Under these circumstances, in order to strive for a great leap forward in agricultural production, party and government leading organs in various regions launched mass-scale prevention and control movements by mobilizing the masses to speak out freely and contend, launching continuous struggles against various pests and diseases from spring to autumn, and the results were far greater than in previous years. According to statistics from the National Plant Protection Work Conference convened by the Ministry of Agriculture, this year the total area treated for pests and diseases on cotton, wheat, rice, corn, sorghum, millet, sweet potatoes, and other crops, as well as fruit trees, in various regions nationwide reached more than 1.8 billion mu.

    On the basis of carrying out large-scale prevention and control work, many counties (cities) have emerged nationwide this year that have basically eliminated one or several major pests and diseases. Gansu Province has basically eliminated five types of pests and diseases, including wheat smut, wheat nematode disease, wheat plant bugs, pea weevils, and cotton bollworms, becoming the first province in the country to eliminate the most types of pests and diseases. In addition, 730 counties (cities) nationwide have basically eliminated one or several pests or rodents that were stipulated for elimination in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule.

    This year, "native pesticides" played a huge role in the large-scale pest and disease control campaign. In order to make up for the shortage of chemical pesticides, by the end of August, the masses in various regions nationwide had discovered and created more than 500 kinds of native pesticides, established more than 2.5 million native pesticide factories, and produced more than 16 million tons of medicines. People used these native pesticides in combination with chemical pesticides to severely attack pests and diseases.

    In the movement to prevent and control pests and diseases, the wisdom of the masses solved many problems that scientists at home and abroad have not yet solved, making a major contribution to the great technological revolution. Wang Zhihai, a technician at the Hunan Agricultural Science Institute, found its overwintering host. This year, Yizhang County eliminated rice planthoppers on the host based on Wang Zhihai's discovery and combined it with field control, becoming a county without rice planthoppers. Corn borer is an international pest, but Changzhi Prefecture in Shanxi Province has achieved very successful control, achieving no row holes in leaves, no borer holes in stems, and no wind breakage of tassels on more than 3 million mu of corn land.

    全面防治　土洋结合　全面消灭　重点肃清
    明年消灭十一大病虫害
    全国七百三十个县市消灭了一种或几种病虫害
    本报讯　向全歼农作物的主要病虫害进军。20日结束的全国植物保护工作会议，就这个目标，讨论了1959年在全国范围内用除四害的精神展开全面的歼灭战，彻底消灭十一大病虫害（农业发展纲要规定的）和各地的主要病虫害问题，争取无病虫为害的红旗插遍全国。
    全国植物保护工作会议是农业部召开的。参加会议的有二十七个省、市和自治区以及中央有关部门的代表一百多人。
    会议经过充分讨论，确定明年植物保护工作的方针是：“全面防治，土洋结合，全面消灭，重点肃清”。按照这个方针的要求，明年的植物保护工作，就是要在今年的巨大胜利的基础上，全面消灭各种农作物的主要病虫为害。不仅要消灭农田病虫为害，而且要向山区、牧区进军；不仅要消灭粮、棉病虫为害，而且要消灭果树、蔬菜、油料、麻、烟、茶等作物的病虫害；不仅要消灭病虫害，而且要消灭害鸟害兽。对各种农作物都要做到四护、四保。四护是：“从耕护到种，从种护到青，从青护到黄，从黄护到仓”。四保是：保苗、保株、保穗、保粒。
    会议规定明年的任务是：一、在全国范围内彻底消灭蝗虫、稻螟虫、粘虫、玉米螟虫、棉蚜虫、棉红蜘蛛、棉红铃虫、小麦吸浆虫、麦类黑穗病、小麦线虫病、甘薯黑斑病等十一种病虫为害，以及当地的主要作物的主要病虫害。二、各省、市和自治区要肃清一种至几种病虫和更多地创造全无病虫为害的县。
    会议指出，在明年一年中完成上述任务是有可能的。有利条件是，防治病虫害的工作是农业八条“宪法”之一，将更加引起各地的重视。同时，人民公社化的完成和巩固，人民群众共产主义觉悟的日益提高，今冬明春的深翻土地，特别是全国已有三分之一左右的县市基本消灭一种或几种病虫为害的光辉范例，都是前所未有的有利条件。会议也指出了明年的任务是艰巨的，必须继续反对右倾保守，更加鼓足干劲，加强领导，全面安排，才能充分发挥有利条件和克服工作中的一切困难。根据今年除治病虫害的成功经验，是要书记动手，政治挂帅，大搞群众运动；在抓思想、抓组织、抓现场参观促进、抓药械的同时，要依靠广大群众掌握病虫情报，掌握病虫害发生和发展的规律，抓住关键性的时机，有计划有组织有步骤地展开歼灭战。
    为了完成明年的任务，会议还要求各地立即动手，大制土农药、土器械。会议强调：消灭一切越冬的病虫害，是各地当前的一项十分重要的任务。因此，必须迅速展开越冬病虫害的防治工作，打响明年全歼主要病虫害的第一炮。
    本报讯　今年植物保护战线上打了空前的大胜仗。全国各种病虫害的防治面积比去年扩大了一点七倍；有三分之一左右的县、市已经基本上消灭了一种或几种主要病虫为害，对保障农业空前大丰收起了重大作用。
    由于不少地区气温不够正常，今年各种农作物的病虫害比去年发生的早，面积广；几年一大发生的麦锈病和斜纹夜蛾都比去年严重得多。在这种情况下，为了力争农业生产大跃进，各地党、政领导机关用发动群众大鸣大放的办法掀起了群众性的大面积防治运动，从春到秋向各种病虫害展开了连续的斗争，效果都大大的超过了往年。据农业部召开的全国植物保护工作会议统计，今年全国各地对棉花、小麦、水稻、玉米、高粱、谷子、薯类等作物以及果树等各种病虫害的防治面积共达十八亿多亩。
    在大面积开展防治工作的基础上，今年全国出现了很多基本上消灭了一种或几种主要病虫害的县（市）。甘肃省已经基本上消灭了麦类黑穗病、小麦线虫病、麦椿象、豌豆象和棉花红铃虫等五种病虫害，成了全国第一个消灭病虫害种类最多的省。另外，全国有七百三十个县（市）提前基本上消灭了一种或几种全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定消灭的病虫害或鼠害。
    今年，在大规模的防治病虫害的斗争中，“土农药”发挥了巨大作用。为了弥补化学农药的不足，到8月底，全国各地群众已发现和创造出土农药五百多种，建立土农药厂二百五十多万个，制药一千六百多万吨。人们凭着这些土农药，和化学农药结合起来使用，使病虫害受到了严重的打击。
    在防治病虫害的运动中，群众的智慧解决了很多中外科学家至今还没有解决的问题，对科学技术大革新作出了重大贡献。湖南农业科学研究所的技工王治海却找到了它的越冬寄主。今年宜章县根据王治海的发现消灭了寄主上的稻飞虱并且结合田间防治，成了无稻飞虱的县。玉米螟是国际性大病虫，而山西省长治专区却防治得十分成功，在三百多万亩玉米地上，做到了叶无排孔、茎无蛀洞，雄穗无风折。
