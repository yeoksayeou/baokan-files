　　"Wutong leaves fall, willow colors fly yellow," autumn ends and winter comes. Today is "Start of Winter," which can be said to be the beginning of the winter season. However, China has a vast territory, and the arrival of winter varies from place to place. Winter comes earliest in Xinjiang, Northeast China, and Inner Mongolia, around "Cold Dew." The North China region enters winter between "Frost's Descent" and "Start of Winter." Winter in Central China begins around "Light Snow." In Fujian and Southern Zhejiang (Ou River basin), winter colors are not seen until "Great Cold." Southern Guangdong may not even experience winter throughout the year.

  According to the general method of dividing the four seasons, only when the average temperature per pentad (five days) is below 10 degrees Celsius is it considered winter. Therefore, the length of winter varies in different parts of China. In Yushan and other places north of Wenzhou, there are only two months of winter each year. Yunnan and Guizhou have about two or three months of winter. The middle reaches of the Yangtze River have an average of three and a half months of winter. The lower reaches of the Yangtze River have winter for four months or even a little longer. The North China region has more than five months of winter. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has five and a half to six and a half months of winter. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has five to six months of winter. The Northeast region has the longest winter, about six to seven months, or even up to eight months. This shows that in various parts of China, the more northerly the region, the earlier winter arrives and the longer the winter season; the more southerly the region, the later winter arrives and the shorter the winter season.

  Our ancestors originally lived in the Yellow River basin, and the establishment of the twenty-four solar terms was based on the geographical climate of the Yellow River basin. Therefore, the solar term "Start of Winter" is completely suitable for various parts of North China.　(Jin Qianli)

    节届冬令
    “梧桐落叶，柳色飞黄”，秋尽冬来了。今天是“立冬”节，可以说是冬令的开始。不过我国地域辽阔，冬季到来，迟早不一。新疆、东北、内蒙古各地，冬天来得最早，大概在“寒露”前后；华北地区在“霜降”、“立冬”之间，便行冬令；华中的冬天，大约起自“小雪”；福建、浙南（瓯江流域），须至“大寒”，才见冬色；粤南甚至全年无冬。
  按照一般划分四季的方法，以每候（五天为一候）平均温度在摄氏10度以下的才叫冬季。因此我国各地冬季的长短，也就不一样。温州以北渔山等地，每年只有两个月是冬季；云南、贵州，大约有两三个月的冬季；长江中游平均有三个半月的冬季；长江下游的冬季，就有四个月还多一点；华北地区的冬季，达到五个多月；内蒙古自治区，有五个半月到六个半月的冬季；新疆维吾尔自治区，有五到六个月的冬季；东北地区，冬季最长，约有六至七个月，甚至达八个月的。这里说明在我国各地的冬令，地区越偏北，冬季来到最早，冬季的时日就越长；地区越偏南，冬令来到很迟，冬季的时日就越短。
    我们的祖先，原来聚居在黄河流域，二十四节气的建立，就是以黄河流域的地理气候为基础的。因此“立冬”这一个节气，在华北各地完全适合。　（金千里）
