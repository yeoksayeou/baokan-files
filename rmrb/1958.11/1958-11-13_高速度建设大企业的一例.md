An Example of High-Speed Construction of a Large Enterprise
Huagong

The builders of Anshan Iron and Steel (An'gang) used the world's fastest speed to build a giant blast furnace in China, the largest in scale and the most advanced in technology, setting a precedent for high-speed construction of large enterprises. This is a major event in China's industrial construction.

Adopting the "small-scale, indigenous groups" approach to rapidly develop the iron and steel industry has continuously produced provinces and counties with tens of thousands of tons of output. However, some people still have doubts about whether large enterprises can also be built at high speed. They believe that the construction process of such enterprises is complex and the technical requirements are strict, making high-speed construction difficult. The construction experience of An'gang's No. 10 blast furnace precisely answers this question. The No. 10 blast furnace is a large and foreign-style furnace, larger in volume and more technologically complex than any blast furnace China has ever built. However, after the masses unleashed their overwhelming power, the construction speed was halved. This experience proves that as long as the masses are fully mobilized and thinking is thoroughly liberated, "large" and "foreign" combined with "groups" can advance at a speed beyond general imagination.

The power of the masses is infinite, and there is no limit to the speed of construction. Some people believe that it takes eight months for foreign countries to build a blast furnace, which is already the world's highest record. China's technical level is not as good as that of foreign countries, so how can it be shortened further? However, when the Party organization handed this question over to the masses for discussion, the masses confidently broke this conservative view. Speed is created by people. If everything is done according to old rules, there is no question of developing at high speed. Therefore, the essence of speed is the question of trusting the masses, and the infinite potential of the masses is the source of high speed.

Is the construction of An'gang's No. 10 blast furnace the highest speed for the construction of large blast furnaces? When analyzing and summarizing the experience and lessons learned in each construction process, the builders believe that the speed of four months and twenty-six days is not the limit of blast furnace construction speed, and the masses have even greater potential to tap. If the construction experience of An'gang's No. 10 blast furnace is promoted, it is expected that even higher world records will appear in other steel bases and iron and steel complexes in the near future.

    高速度建设大企业的一例
    华工
    鞍钢建设者用世界上最快的速度建成了一座我国规模最大、技术最新的巨型高炉，开辟了高速度建设大企业的先例。这是我国工业建设中的一件大事。
    采用小土群办法，高速度发展钢铁工业，已经不断出现了万吨省和万吨县。但是，大企业的建设是否也能高速度进行，在有些人的头脑中还有疑问。他们以为这种企业的建设过程复杂，技术要求严格，高速度建设是有困难的。鞍钢十号高炉的建设经验，正好回答了这个疑问。十号高炉是又大又洋的炉子，它的容积比我国曾经建设过的高炉都要大、技术也更复杂，但在群众发挥了排山倒海的力量后，建设速度就缩短了一半。这个经验证明，只要充分发动群众、彻底解放思想，“大”“洋”加上了“群”，就可以以超乎一般想像的高速度前进。
    群众的威力是无穷的，建设速度也就没有到顶的时候。有些人认为外国用八个月时间建成一座高炉，已经是世界最高的纪录了，我国的技术水平不如外国，怎能缩得更短？但是，当党组织把这个问题交给群众讨论的时候，群众就满怀信心地打破了这种保守观点。速度是人创造的，如果一切按老规矩办事，就谈不上什么高速度向前发展。所以速度的本质问题是相信群众的问题，群众的无穷潜力是高速度的源泉。
    鞍钢的十号高炉的建设是不是大高炉建设的最高速度呢？建设者们在分析和总结了每个建设过程中的经验教训时，认为四个月二十六天的速度还不是高炉建设速度的极限，群众还有更大的潜力可挖。如果推广鞍钢十号高炉的建设经验，预计在不久的将来，还会有更高的世界纪录出现在其他钢铁基地和钢铁联合企业。
