    The Long-Range Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the Soviet Union
    Yo. Yo. Kuzmin, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the State Planning Commission of the Soviet Union
    The Soviet people, together with the people of the fraternal socialist countries and friends all over the world, joyfully celebrate the forty-first anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, which proclaimed the collapse of imperialism and the beginning of the construction of a new socialist society.
    The October Revolution saved our country from collapse, freed it from its semi-colonial status, led the Soviet people onto the glorious road of a communist future, and paved the way for the people of other countries to move toward socialism now and in the future.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, following the path indicated by the great Lenin, the Soviet Union has made great achievements in all aspects of economic and cultural construction.
    Our country was economically and technologically backward in the past, and was further impoverished by the World War from 1914 to 1918 and foreign armed intervention, but our country overcame all difficulties and became a powerful industrial country in the world.
    The great leap forward from backwardness to a high level of development in the Soviet Union powerfully proves the absolute superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system.
    The socialist camp, which sprouted in revolutionary Petrograd on November 7, 1917, now includes more than a quarter of the world's land area, stretching from the Pacific Ocean in the east to the Adriatic coast in the west, and has a large population and abundant material resources. In the peaceful competition with capitalism, the economic and political positions of socialism are being consolidated year by year. Capitalism, which is destined to die by the course of historical development, is following the path of decline and decay.
    Since the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet Union has made great progress.
    At present, the Soviet people are preparing to welcome the 21st Congress of their Communist Party in a worthy manner. Workers and peasants of enterprises, construction sites, collective farms, and state farms have universally put forward high labor tasks in order to greet the 21st Congress of the Party. The broad masses of working people have launched a nationwide socialist competition to complete the 1958 plan for the development of the national economy ahead of schedule. The 21st Congress of the CPSU will be of great significance to the Soviet people, as it will review the planned targets for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union over the past seven years. As Comrade Khrushchev pointed out, the seven-year plan is our program, a program for the great construction of communism.
    Now, the construction of communism in our country is no longer a distant future, but a goal that the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party are directly practicing. The prospect of a further and greater upsurge in all sectors of the national economy is becoming clearer and clearer to the working people year by year, and the image of the magnificent communist edifice is becoming more and more distinct.
    Considering that the Soviet Union began to build socialism in poverty and after suffering severe damage, it is understandable that the task of building a new society that lay before the Soviet people after the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution was significant and arduous.
    As everyone knows, the level of economic development in Russia before the revolution was far behind that of capitalist countries. Russia's industry did not guarantee the country's need for essential products. Russia produced almost no high-quality steel, automobiles, or other essential industrial products. About two-thirds of the machinery needed by the country was imported.
    Due to the low level of economic development in Russia, and also due to the fierce class hatred of the bourgeoisie and its politicians and theorists, countless "theories" emerged about the inevitable bankruptcy of the "socialist experiment." Imperialist politicians and theorists unanimously declared that the days of the Soviet regime were numbered. The American commentator Robert Wilton wrote in his book "Russia's Death Struggle," published in 1919, "...From an economic point of view, the continued existence of the Soviet system is impossible, and from a political point of view, it is absurd." The British writer Herbert Wells also expressed this idea, writing in his book "Russia in the Shadows" that if the United States and Western European countries did not help Russia, then Russia "has no other future than the complete destruction of the last remnants of modern civilization..." Similar "predictions" and "prophecies" poisoned the atmosphere, but failed to stop the advance of history.
    In the early days of socialist economic construction, Lenin said that it was impossible to save Russia by a good harvest alone, because that was not enough. In any case, it was necessary to establish a powerful heavy industry as quickly as possible in order to eliminate the economic and technological backwardness of pre-war Russia for generations in the shortest possible time and to ensure socialist construction.
    The Communist Party, guided by Lenin's theory of building socialism, formulated a program for national industrialization. The Party unleashed the creativity of the working people to solve this task. In order to transform our motherland into a country with a first-class socialist industry and a highly mechanized socialist agriculture, the working people of our country consciously endured certain hardships.
    Objective conditions required that our country could only achieve industrialization in the shortest possible period by relying on internal material wealth, because in the face of hostile capitalist encirclement, it was impossible to count on any foreign aid.
    Now, the Soviet Union has become such a country that it produces modern means of production not only to guarantee its own needs, but also to export them. Our country provides fraternal socialist countries with selfless assistance and provides equipment to countries that have freed themselves from colonial oppression and are embarking on the road of independent development.
    The achievements of the Soviet Union in industry are the greatest historical leap forward from the backward and simple technology of old Russia to the first-class machine industry, to the powerful steel, chemical, oil, and gas industries, and to the extensive electrification of all sectors of the national economy.
    In terms of industrial output, the Soviet Union has jumped to first place in Europe and second place in the world.
    The current level of economic development in our country has made it possible to solve the basic economic task of catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product output in the shortest historical period.
    In September 1957, the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union adopted a resolution on formulating a long-range plan for the development of our country's national economy from 1959 to 1965.
    The adoption of this resolution is related to the major changes that have taken place in the economic development of the Soviet Union in recent years.
    In 1957, the Soviet Union carried out a fundamental reorganization of the management of industry and construction. Enterprises and construction projects began to be managed by the National Economic Councils established in various economic administrative regions.
    The new system of industrial and construction management has created enormous conditions for more fully utilizing the rich resources of the Soviet economy, further developing the specialization and cooperation of production, and solving the more complex tasks of industrial upsurge and the comprehensive and integrated development of all economic regions of the country.
    The discovery of iron ore, coal, non-ferrous metals, and non-metallic minerals in the western and eastern Siberia regions by Soviet geologists in recent years is of great significance. The proven oil and gas resources have greatly increased. On the basis of the newly discovered mineral deposits, it is possible to build large enterprises and develop new industrial centers. It is estimated that it will take at least five to seven years to complete these most important national economic tasks.
    In compiling the long-range plan for the development of the national economy, the Soviet planning agencies are guided by the historic resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the various resolutions of the Party and the government, and the program for the economic development of the Soviet Union over the past fifteen years outlined by Comrade Khrushchev in his report to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.
    As Comrade Khrushchev has pointed out, it is estimated that in about fifteen years the annual output of industrial products in the Soviet Union will reach the following levels: iron ore mining - 250 million to 300 million tons, iron - 75 million to 85 million tons, steel - 100 million to 120 million tons, coal - 650 million to 750 million tons, oil - 350 million to 400 million tons, gas extraction and production - 270 billion to 320 billion cubic meters, electricity - 800 billion to 900 billion kilowatt-hours, cement - 90 million to 110 million tons, sugar - 9 million to 10 million tons, wool fabrics - 550 million to 650 million meters, leather shoes - 600 million to 700 million pairs. This means that in the next fifteen years, the Soviet Union will not only be able to catch up with, but also to surpass the current output of important industrial products in the United States. Of course, the US economy will not stand still during this period, but if we take into account that the rate of industrial development in our country is much faster than in the United States, then the task of surpassing the United States in the shortest period of time in peaceful competition is realistic and achievable.
    The Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union have determined the main historical task of the long-range plan. This task is to ensure the further strong upsurge of all sectors of the national economy on the basis of the priority development of the production of means of production and to greatly improve the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people on the basis of the growth of national public wealth.
    To solve this task, it is necessary to vigorously improve labor productivity on the basis of continuous technological progress and the adoption and promotion of advanced scientific and technological achievements in all sectors of production.
    In the next seven years, while realizing socialist expanded reproduction, it is stipulated that there will be profound qualitative changes in the entire economy of the Soviet Union, and there will be significant changes in the most important national economic ratios.
    From 1959 to 1965, the Soviet Union will develop the chemical industry at an unprecedented rate. The plenary session of the Central Committee of the CPSU in May 1958 formulated a grand program for the development of the chemical industry, first of all, vigorously developing the production of plastics, artificial fibers, synthetic rubber, substitutes for food raw materials, and other synthetic materials.
    In order to complete the formulated program for the development of the chemical industry, it is stipulated that more than 100 billion rubles will be invested in this sector, and more than 250 new and renovated enterprises will be built. The development of the chemical industry should ensure the technological progress of the national economy and greatly expand the production of daily necessities.
    From 1959 to 1965, the development of the iron and steel industry, especially the iron ore base, will reach a high level. The plan stipulates that the iron and steel industry should be widely developed in new areas, especially in the eastern part of our country. The technology of the iron and steel industry will be further improved, and powerful and fully modernized equipment and enterprises will be established. The open-hearth and converter workshops to be built in the future will use oxygen blowing. In our iron and steel industry, natural gas will be used on a large scale in open-hearth furnaces for the first time. Continuous casting will be widely promoted. The production of rolled steel, pipes, metal products, and sheet metal, especially cold-rolled sheet, will be widely expanded.
    In the next seven years, the problem of supplying the Soviet national economy with fuel will be solved in principle according to new methods. The Soviet Union has vast oil and natural gas resources, so it is possible to extract oil and gas much faster than coal. The widespread use of the above-mentioned types of fuel can achieve great economic results. It is estimated that tens of billions of rubles can be saved on major expenses alone. The significant increase in the proportion of gas and liquid fuels in the fuel balance will also reduce the cost of fuel consumption.
    While planning the rapid development of the oil industry, it is necessary to strengthen the new forces in oil processing. In order to supply raw materials to oil processing plants and ensure users' needs for oil products, it is necessary to build a large network of oil pipelines and oil product pipelines, which will greatly reduce the burden of rail transportation of oil and oil products.
    In the next seven years, cities that currently have gas will complete gasification, and gas will be supplied to other cities and settlements near gas pipelines. Cities and settlements far from gas pipelines will organize the supply of liquefied gas in tanks.
    The plan stipulates that open-hearth furnaces and blast furnaces should be converted to gas, which is expected to increase the annual output of existing open-hearth furnaces by 2 million to 2.5 million tons of steel.
    Cement plants, glass factories, machine-building factories, and the largest power stations in our country will obtain a large amount of gas. Converting power stations and industrial enterprises to gas will not only achieve great economic results, but also improve the air in cities.
    The development of the gas industry can reduce the number of workers extracting fuel, while expanding the gas pipeline network can greatly reduce the burden of rail transportation of fuel.
    In the next seven years, it is planned to take huge measures to realize Lenin's legacy on national electrification. The plan stipulates that the new electricity of power stations should be greatly increased mainly by building thermal power stations that use economic fuels. This will make it possible to greatly increase the electricity consumption of industry, agriculture, and transportation.
    In the next seven years, major tasks will be solved in the machine-building industry. The Soviet machine-building industry has reached a high level of development, so it is now possible to double the output of the machine-building industry with less investment, improve the technical level of production, and meet the growing needs of the national economy for modern machines and equipment with high production efficiency. Further expanding and strengthening the specialization and cooperation of machine-building production will be of great help in this regard. The high-speed development of the machine-building industry, especially the rapid development of the production of automated and semi-automated machine tools, makes it possible to widely implement full mechanization and automation of production, which creates great conditions for further improving labor productivity.
    Automation is one of the most important directions of technological progress in the next seven years.
    There are also great tasks in further developing the various industrial sectors that produce daily necessities for the people. By the end of the seven-year plan, the production of light industrial and food industrial products will be greatly increased. For example, under the condition of using artificial fibers, the production of textiles in 1965 compared with 1957 will increase as follows: silk fabrics will increase 1.3 times, cotton fabrics will increase 5 times; knitted shirts and blouses made of artificial fibers will increase more than 8 times, shoes made of artificial leather will increase 1.3 times, and the production of porous light-soled shoes will increase to 40 times.
    The quantity of production increase of daily necessities for the people stipulated in the plan can solve the problem of meeting the residents' needs for textiles, clothing, and shoes.
    In recent years, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has done a great deal of work in further developing agriculture. Experienced leading cadres have been sent to collective farms and state farms, the material and technical basis of agriculture has been greatly strengthened, measures have been formulated and taken to improve the material interests of collective farm members and state farm workers, and the agricultural planning system has been changed. These measures have promoted greater initiative among collective farm members in organizing agricultural production and have made it possible to greatly increase the production of agricultural products. In recent years, collective farms have become economically powerful and diversified economic sectors with machinery and the necessary skilled cadres.
    Recently, our Party has taken new and major measures in further developing the collective farm system and improving agricultural production, namely, transferring agricultural machinery to collective farms and reorganizing machine tractor stations.
    The huge work of reclaiming 36 million hectares of wasteland in the eastern regions of our country, based on the initiative of Comrade Khrushchev, is of great significance.
    Due to the reclamation of wasteland, it has become possible to realize the resolution adopted by the 20th Congress of the Party on distributing agricultural sectors economically and appropriately according to the conditions of each region of the country, that is, the resolution on the specialization of agricultural production.
    For example, it is no longer necessary to expand wheat planting in many areas of Ukraine, Moldavia, and the North Caucasus, which were previously considered the main bases for grain production. It has become possible to allow these areas to specialize in the production of sugar beets, various varieties of corn, and hybrid corn seeds to meet the needs of other regions of our country, and also to specialize in the production of livestock products, fruits, and grapes.
    In the republics of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, it is becoming possible to allow collective farms and state farms to specialize in the production of meat and milk. In the Moscow region, in order to ensure the supply of Moscow City, collective farms and state farms are beginning to develop in the direction of specialization in the production of potatoes, vegetables, meat, and milk. The conditions for producing cotton, grapes, fruits, and citrus crops are fully available in the Central Asian and Caucasian republics.
    In recent years, the development speed of publicly owned animal husbandry in collective farms and state farms has been unprecedented. This is due to the extra billions of poods of grain obtained from wasteland, especially due to the greatly expanded planting area of corn, which is the main source of establishing a consolidated feed base for animal husbandry.
    Due to the achievements in animal husbandry, collective farmers have the conditions to propose and successfully implement catching up with and surpassing the United States in the production of milk, oil, and meat per capita.
    In the next seven years, it is expected to greatly expand the mechanization and electrification of agricultural production, and to further equip collective farms and state farms with advanced machinery, which is the decisive condition for completing the tasks of developing various sectors of agriculture. The plan also stipulates greatly increasing the production of mineral fertilizers and chemicals to protect crops from diseases and insect pests.
    In terms of the development of the transportation industry, profound qualitative changes will also occur in the next seven years. As everyone knows, not long ago, the railway transportation in our country was developed on the basis of steam locomotive traction. The 20th Congress of the CPSU determined a new direction for the development of railway transportation. According to the adopted resolution, a grand program for the electrification of railway transportation will be realized from 1959 to 1965. At the same time, the transportation industry will receive a large number of high-horsepower internal combustion locomotives. At present, steam locomotives are no longer produced, and the production of electric locomotives and internal combustion locomotives is being expanded. By the end of the seven-year plan, railway transportation will basically realize traction with electric locomotives and internal combustion locomotives. Air, sea, river, automobile, and pipeline transportation will also be greatly developed.
    In the long-range plan that stipulates the further upsurge of the Soviet socialist industry and agriculture, the concern of the Communist Party and the Soviet government for the happy life of the Soviet people is reflected.
    The high development of the productive forces of the Soviet Union and the accelerated adoption of the latest scientific and technological achievements in all sectors of the national economy will greatly improve the material well-being of our people in the next seven years on the basis of the increase in public wealth and national income. All Soviet people will live better.
    The living standards of the people will be greatly improved by raising the wages of workers and staff, especially those with lower wages, and by allocating large sums of money for welfare benefits, improving medical services, protecting the health of residents, and other social and cultural measures.
    On the basis of the development of agricultural production and the improvement of labor productivity, the income of collective farmers will also be greatly increased.
    From 1959 to 1965, the further development of light industry, the food industry, especially the chemical industry, and agriculture will ensure that the people can obtain sufficient, good, cheap, and beautiful textiles, clothing, shoes, daily necessities, and food.
    In the next seven years, great attention will be paid to improving public catering, commerce, and better organizing daily services for residents.
    In terms of measures to educate young people, the development of a boarding school network and the reorganization of the entire system of secondary and higher education are of great significance. The network of nurseries and kindergartens will also be greatly expanded.
    Housing construction work will be widely carried out to ensure the completion of the decision made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Soviet government - to eliminate the phenomenon of insufficient housing within ten to twelve years.
    According to the resolution of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the seven-hour or six-hour working day for workers and staff has been partially implemented in the Soviet Union, and will be fully realized in the next few years.
    Measures to improve the working conditions of workers will also be implemented in these seven years, and the latest scientific and technological achievements will be adopted in terms of production hygiene and technical safety.
    There is no doubt that the Soviet people will use selfless labor to further improve the development of productive forces and obtain more fruitful results from their enthusiastic labor year by year.

          *　*　*
    When formulating the long-range plan from 1959 to 1965, the planning agencies of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have tried their best to more fully consider the superiority of the division of labor among socialist countries. The international socialist division of labor can promote the growth of social labor productivity, thereby improving the speed of national economic development in socialist countries.
    At the meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries, it was unanimously pointed out that the socialist economic system guarantees the development of productive forces at a high speed that capitalism cannot match, and on this basis, improves the material well-being and cultural living standards of the working people of socialist countries.
    The cooperation and fraternal mutual assistance of socialist countries are of extreme importance to the economic development of these countries. This cooperation is formed by the commonality of the state system and social system of these countries, the principles of proletarian internationalism, and the consistency of goals.
    Almost a hundred years ago, Marx wrote: "...If insufficient attention is paid to the fraternal union that should exist between the workers of all countries and can arouse them to support each other in the struggle for liberation, their dispersed efforts will be punished by common failure."
    No matter how the enemies of socialism try to split the unity of the socialist camp, and no matter how they fantasize about alienating socialist countries and making them advance toward socialism separately and independently, these fantasies and attempts are doomed to failure.
    The unity of all countries that are building socialism and firmly standing on the position of Marxism-Leninism cannot be shaken by anyone.
    The fraternal socialist countries constantly develop their forms of cooperation and make them increasingly perfect. The relations between them are built on the principle of complete equality. The socialist nature of this cooperation makes it possible to arrange their economic relations more rationally.
    On November 6, 1957, Comrade Mao Zedong correctly said at the celebration meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union that since the beginning of history, the relations between any countries could not be as closely related as those between socialist countries, so mutually respecting and trusting, so mutually assisting and encouraging.
    The fraternal ties between the countries of the socialist camp are becoming stronger day by day, and there is no doubt that the result will be to consolidate and strengthen the unity and strength of the entire socialist camp, and to make the economic development of each socialist country faster and the living standards of the people improve faster. As a Chinese proverb says, "With three people having one mind, yellow soil can be turned into gold."
    The great Chinese people, who are moving forward along the road of socialist construction with full confidence, have made inestimable contributions to the cause of consolidating the socialist camp.
    The tremendous achievements of the People's Republic of China in developing the economy, culture, and science in the past nine years have made the people of the entire socialist camp rejoice. The ninth anniversary of the People's Republic of China is not only a great festival for the Chinese people, but also a common festival for all socialist countries.
    The great achievements made by the countries of the socialist camp in economic development clearly confirm the great power of the invincible thought of Marxism-Leninism. (Attached pictures)

    苏联发展国民经济的远景计划
    苏联部长会议副主席苏联国家计划委员会主席  约·约·库兹明
    苏联人民同社会主义阵营各兄弟国家的人民以及全世界的朋友们一道，欢欣鼓舞地庆祝宣告了帝国主义崩溃和新的社会主义社会建设开始的伟大十月社会主义革命四十一周年。
    十月革命拯救了我国免遭崩溃，使我国摆脱了半殖民地的地位，把苏联人民引上了光辉的共产主义未来的道路，并且为其他国家人民现在和将来走向社会主义开辟康庄大道。
    苏联在共产党的领导下，遵循着伟大的列宁指示的道路，在经济和文化建设各个方面都取得了巨大成就。
    我国过去经济技术落后，经过1914至1918年的世界大战和外国武装干涉更加贫困不堪，但是我们的国家克服了一切困难，成为世界上强大的工业国。
    苏联由落后向高度发展水平的大跃进，有力地证明了社会主义制度对资本主义制度的绝对优越性。
    1917年11月7日在革命的彼得堡萌芽的社会主义阵营，现在已包括东起太平洋，西至亚得里亚海岸的全世界四分之一以上的土地，而且人口众多，物质资源丰富。在同资本主义的和平竞赛中，社会主义的经济和政治阵地一年比一年巩固。由历史发展进程注定死亡的资本主义，正走着衰退、没落的道路。
    从伟大的十月社会主义革命以来，苏联已经大大向前发展了。
    目前，苏联人民正在准备无愧地迎接自己的共产党的第二十一次代表大会。各企业、建筑工地、集体农庄和国营农场的职工和农民，为了迎接党的第二十一次代表大会，普遍提出了很高的劳动任务。广大的劳动人民群众掀起了为提前完成1958年发展国民经济计划的全民社会主义竞赛的浪潮。苏共第二十一次代表大会对于苏联人民将具有重大意义，大会将审查苏联最近七年发展国民经济的规定数字。正像赫鲁晓夫同志所指出的，七年计划是我们的纲领，是伟大的共产主义建设的纲领。
    现在，在我国建成共产主义已经不是遥远的未来，而是在共产党领导下的苏联人民直接实践的目标了。国民经济各部门进一步巨大高涨的远景，一年比一年更加清楚的展现在劳动人民的眼前，光辉的共产主义大厦的形象越来越鲜明了。
    如果考虑到苏联是在贫困和遭到严重破坏的情况下开始建设社会主义的，那末，在伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利以后，摆在苏联人民面前的建成新社会的任务重大和艰巨，是很可以理解的。
    大家知道，革命前俄国的经济发展水平大大落后于资本主义国家。俄国的工业没有保证国家对必需产品的需要。俄国几乎完全没有生产过优质钢、汽车和其他最重要的工业产品。国家所需的机器，约有三分之二依靠进口。
    由于俄国经济发展的水平低，同时由于资产阶级及其政客和理论家的凶恶的阶级仇恨，便出现了无数关于“社会主义实验”必遭破产的“理论”。帝国主义的政客和理论家异口同声宣称，苏维埃政权存在的日子已经屈指可数了。美国的政论家罗伯特·威尔顿在1919年出版的“俄国的垂死挣扎”一书中写道，“……从经济观点看，苏维埃制度的继续存在是不可能的，从政治观点看，也是荒谬绝伦的”。英国作家赫伯特·威尔斯也表达了这种思想，他在“黑暗中的俄国”一书中写道，如果美国和西欧国家不去帮助俄国，那末，俄国“除了彻底毁灭现代文明的最后残余以外，没有任何其他前途……。”类似的“预测”和“预言”虽然毒化了空气，但是没有能够制止历史的前进。
    在社会主义经济建设的初期，列宁曾说道，拯救俄国不可能只靠丰收，因为这还不够。不管怎样，必需用最快的速度建立起强大的重工业，以便在最短期内消灭战前俄国世世代代的经济技术落后状态，保证社会主义建设。
    以列宁关于建设社会主义的学说为指南的共产党，制定了国家工业化的纲领。党发挥了劳动人民的创造力去解决这项任务。为了使我们祖国变成为一个拥有头等社会主义工业和高度机械化的社会主义农业的国家，我国劳动人民自觉地忍受一定的艰难困苦。
    客观条件要求我国只能靠内部的物质财富在最短期间内实现工业化，因为在敌对的资本主义包围的情况下，指望任何的外援都是不可能的。
    现在，苏联已经变成了这样的国家，它生产现代化的生产资料不仅为了保证自己的需要，而且还向外输出。我国给予社会主义阵营各兄弟国家无私的援助，并且向摆脱了殖民主义压迫、走向独立发展道路的国家提供设备。
    苏联在工业方面的成就，是由旧俄落后的、简陋的技术，向头等的机器工业，向强大的钢铁、化学、石油和煤气工业，向国民经济各个部门的广泛电气化的最伟大的具有历史意义的跃进。
    按照工业品的产量计算，苏联已跃居欧洲第一位和世界第二位。
    目前我国经济的发展水平，已能够在最短的历史时期内解决这样的基本经济任务，即在按人口计算的产品生产水平方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    1957年9月，苏共中央和苏联部长会议通过了关于制定1959年至1965年发展我国国民经济远景计划的决议。
    通过这项决议，是同最近几年苏联经济发展中发生的重大变化有关。
    在1957年，苏联进行了工业和建筑业管理的根本改组。企业和建筑工程开始通过各经济行政区成立的国民经济委员会进行管理。
    工业和建筑业管理的新制度，为更充分地利用苏联经济的丰富资源和进一步发展生产的专业化和协作，为解决工业高涨和全国各经济区全面、综合发展的较复杂的任务，创造了巨大的条件。
    最近几年，苏联地质工作者在西部和东西伯利亚地区发现的铁矿、煤、有色金属和非金属矿物等产地具有重要的意义。正勘探的石油和煤气资源大大地增加了。在新发现的矿产地的基础上，可以建设大企业和发展新的工业中心。据估计，要完成这些最重要的国民经济任务至少需要五年到七年。
    苏联计划机关在编制发展国民经济远景计划的工作中，是以苏共第二十次代表大会的历史性决议，以党和政府的各项决议和赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联最高苏维埃庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的会上所作的报告中显示的最近十五年苏联经济发展的纲领为指南的。
    正如赫鲁晓夫同志已经指出的，预计在十五年左右苏联工业品年产量将达到下列水平：铁矿开采量——二亿五千万到三亿吨，铁——七千五百万到八千五百万吨，钢——一亿到一亿二千万吨，煤——六亿五千万到七亿五千万吨，石油——三亿五千万到四亿吨，煤气的开采和生产量——二千七百亿到三千二百亿立方公尺，电力——八千亿到九千亿度，水泥——九千万到一亿一千万吨，糖——九百万到一千万吨，毛织品——五亿五千万到六亿五千万公尺，皮鞋——六亿到七亿双。这就是说，在最近十五年内苏联不仅能够赶上，而且能够超过美国重要工业品的目前产量。当然，在这个期间美国经济不会原地不动，但是如果估计到我国工业发展的速度比美国快得多，那末，在和平竞赛中，在最短的时期内超过美国的任务是现实的和能够完成的。
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议确定了远景计划的主要历史任务。这个任务就是，在优先发展生产资料生产的基础上，保证国民经济各部门进一步的强大高涨和在全国公共财富增长的基础上，大大提高苏联人民的物质和文化生活水平。
    要解决这项任务，必须在技术不断进步和在各生产部门采用和推广先进的科学和技术成就的基础上，大力提高劳动生产率。
    在未来的七年中，在实现社会主义扩大再生产的同时，规定在苏联整个经济中要有深刻的质的变革，在最重要的国民经济比例中将有重大的改变。
    1959至1965年间，苏联将以空前速度发展化学工业。苏共中央1958年5月全会拟定了发展化学工业的宏伟纲领，首先是大力发展塑料、人造纤维、人造橡胶、粮食原料的代替品和其他合成材料的生产。
    为了完成制定的发展化学工业的纲领，规定在这个部门投资一千多亿卢布，新建和改建二百五十多个企业。化学工业的发展应当保证国民经济的技术进步和大大扩大日用品生产。
    1959到1965年间，钢铁工业，特别是铁矿基地的发展将达到高度的水平。计划规定，在新的地区，特别是在我国东部要广泛发展钢铁工业。钢铁工业的技术将得到进一步改进，将建立起强大的、完全现代化的设备和企业。将来建设的平炉和转炉车间，将采用氧气鼓风。在我们的钢铁工业，规定首次在高炉车间大规模地利用天然煤气。将广泛推广不断浇铸法。将广泛生产轧材、管子、金属制品、板轧材、特别是冷轧薄板。
    在未来的七年中，将原则上按照新的方法解决供应苏联国民经济的燃料问题。苏联拥有庞大的石油和天然煤气资源，因此，开采石油和煤气有可能比开采煤快得多。广泛采用上述类型的燃料，能够收到很大的经济效果。据估计，仅在主要的费用上就能节省几百亿卢布。在燃料平衡结构中，煤气和液体燃料成分大大提高，同样会使消耗燃料的成本降低。
    在计划迅速发展石油工业的同时，必须加强石油加工方面的新力量。为了供应石油加工工厂原料和保证用户对石油制品的需要，必须建设大的输油管和输送石油制品管干线网，这样就有可能大大减轻铁路运输石油和石油制品的负担。
    在未来的七年中，目前有煤气的城市将完成煤气化，并且向煤气管干线附近的其他城市和居民点供应煤气。距离煤气管干线远的城市和居民点将组织供应装在罐内的液化煤气。
    计划规定，平炉和高炉要改用煤气，这样，预计现有的平炉每年可以增产二百万至二百五十万吨钢。
    水泥厂、玻璃工厂、机器制造厂，以及我国最大的发电站都将获得大量煤气。发电站和工业企业改用煤气，不仅会收到很大的经济效果，而且还能改善城市的空气。
    发展煤气工业可以减少开采燃料的工人，而扩大煤气管网又可以大大减少铁路运输燃料的负担。
    在未来的七年中，计划采取巨大措施，实现列宁关于国家电气化的遗训。计划规定，主要靠建设利用经济燃料的火电站来大量增加发电站的新电力。这样将有可能大大增加工业、农业和运输业的用电量。
    在未来的七年中，在机器制造业方面将要解决重大的任务。苏联的机器制造业已经达到高度发展水平，因此现在有可能投入较少的资金而使机器制造业的产品增加一倍，并提高生产的技术水平，满足国民经济对具有高度生产效能的现代化机器和设备的日益增长的需要。进一步扩大和加强机器制造业的专业化和生产的协作，对这方面将有很大的帮助。机器制造业的高速度发展，特别是自动化和半自动化机床生产的迅速发展，就有可能广泛地实行生产全盘机械化和自动化，这样就为进一步提高劳动生产率创造了很大的条件。
    在未来的七年中间，自动化是技术进步的一个最重要的方向。
    在进一步发展生产人民生活必需品的各工业部门方面，也有很大的任务。七年计划末期，轻工业和食品工业产品生产量将大大增加。例如，在利用人造纤维的条件下，1965年同1957年比较，纺织品生产增长的情况如下：丝织品增长一点三倍，棉织品增长五倍；用人造纤维针织的上衣和衬衣将增加八倍多，用人造皮作的鞋增加一点三倍，多孔轻底鞋的生产将增加到四十倍。
    计划规定的人民生活必需品生产增长的数量，可以解决满足居民对纺织品、服装和鞋的需要问题。
    最近几年，苏联共产党在进一步发展农业方面作了巨大的工作。把有经验的领导干部派到了集体农庄和国营农场，农业的物质技术基础大大地加强了，制定并采取了提高集体农庄庄员和国营农场工作人员的物质利益的措施，农业计划制度改变了。这些措施促使集体农庄庄员在组织农业生产方面发挥了更大的积极性，并且使农产品生产有可能大大的提高。最近几年，集体农庄已经成为经济力量雄厚、拥有机器和必需的熟练干部的多种经济部门。
    最近期间，我们的党在进一步发展集体农庄制度和提高农业生产方面，采取了新的重大措施，即把农业机器转交给集体农庄和改组机器拖拉机站。
      我们的党和苏联人民根据赫鲁晓夫同志的倡议，在我国东部地区开垦三千六百万公顷荒地的巨大工作，具有很大的意义。
      由于开垦荒地，才有了可能实现党第二十次代表大会通过的关于根据全国各区情况在经济上因地制宜地分布农业各部门的决议，即关于农业生产专业化的决议。
    例如，已经没有必要在过去认为是谷物生产主要基地的乌克兰、摩尔达维亚和北高加索的很多地区扩大小麦播种了。已经有可能让这些地区专门生产甜菜、各种玉蜀黍品种和杂交玉蜀黍种子来满足我国其他地区的需要，此外还可以专门生产畜牧业产品、水果和葡萄。
    在立陶宛、拉脱维亚和爱沙尼亚等加盟共和国，开始能够让集体农庄和国营农场专门生产肉类和奶类。在莫斯科州，为了保证莫斯科市的供应，集体农庄和国营农场开始向生产土豆、蔬菜、肉类、奶类的专业化方向发展。在中亚细亚和高加索各共和国生产棉花、葡萄、水果和柑橘作物的条件已经充分具备。
    最近几年，集体农庄和国营农场公营畜牧业的发展速度是空前的。这是由于从荒地上额外获得了几十亿普特谷物，特别是由于玉黍蜀的播种面积大大扩大，而玉黍蜀正是建立畜牧业巩固的饲料基地的主要源泉。
    由于在畜牧业方面获得了成就，集体农民就有条件提出和顺利实现在按人口平均计算的奶类、油类和肉类的生产方面赶上和超过美国。
    在未来的七年内，预计要大大扩大农业生产的机械化和电气化，要进一步用先进机器装备集体农庄和国营农场，这是完成发展农业各个部门的任务的决定性条件。计划同样规定大大提高矿物肥料和防护农作物不受病虫害的化学品的生产。
    在运输业的发展方面，未来的七年间也将发生深刻的质的变化。大家知道，在不久以前，我国的铁路运输是在蒸气机车牵引的基础上发展的。苏共第二十次代表大会确定了发展铁路运输的新方向。根据通过的决议，在1959年至1965年间，将实现铁路运输电气化的宏伟纲领。与此同时，运输业将得到大量大马力的内燃机车。目前，已经不再生产蒸气机车，而扩大电气机车和内燃机车的生产。在七年计划末期，铁路运输将基本实现用电气机车和内燃机车牵引。航空、海运、河运、汽车和管道等运输事业也将大大发展。
    在规定使苏联的社会主义工业和农业获得进一步高涨的远景计划中，反映出共产党和苏联政府对苏联人民幸福生活的关怀。
    苏联生产力的高度发展和在国民经济各部门中加快采用科学和技术的最新成就，在未来的七年中，将在公共财富和国民收入增加的基础上大大提高我国人民的物质福利。所有的苏联人会生活得更好。
    通过提高工人和职员，首先是工资较低的人的工资，通过拨出大批款项做为优抚金、改善医疗服务、保护居民健康和其他社会文化措施之用，人民的生活水平将大为提高。
    在农业生产发展和提高劳动生产率的基础上，集体农民的收入也要大大增加。
    在1959到1965年，轻工业、食品工业、特别是化学工业以及农业的进一步发展，保证人民可以得到充足的又好、又便宜的美丽纺织品、服装、鞋子、日常用品和食品。
  在未来的七年中，对于改善公共饮食业、商业以及更好地组织对居民的日常服务方面，将寄予巨大的注意。
    在教育少年的措施方面，发展寄宿学校网和改组中等教育和高等教育的整个制度，具有非常重要的意义。托儿所和幼儿园网也要大大扩大。
    要广泛展开住宅建筑工作，以保证完成共产党中央委员会和苏联政府做出的决定——在十年到十二年的时间内消灭住宅不够的现象。
    根据苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议，苏联已经部分地实行了工人和职员的七小时或六小时工作日，并在最近几年将全部实现。
    在这七年中也要实行改善工人劳动条件的措施，在生产卫生和技术安全方面采用最新的科学技术成就。
    毫无疑问，苏联人将以忘我的劳动使生产力的发展达到进一步的提高，并且一年比一年获得自己热情劳动的更加丰硕的成果。

    在制订1959到1965年的远景计划时，苏联的计划机关以及其他社会主义国家的计划机关，都尽力更加充分地考虑到社会主义国家间劳动分工的优越性。国际上社会主义的劳动分工可以促进社会劳动生产率的增长，从而提高社会主义阵营各国国民经济发展的速度。
    在社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表举行的会议上，一致指出社会主义经济制度保证生产力以资本主义望尘莫及的高速度发展，并在此基础上提高社会主义各国劳动人民的物质福利和文化生活水平。
    社会主义国家的合作和兄弟般的互助，对于这些国家的经济发展具有极重要的意义。这种合作是由这些国家的国家制度和社会制度的共同性、无产阶级国际主义原则和目标的一致而形成的。
    差不多在一百年以前，马克思曾经写道：“……对于各国工人之间应当存在的、并可在争取解放的斗争中唤起他们互相支持的兄弟般联合，如果采取不够注意的态度，他们的分散的努力则会得到共同失败的惩罚。”
    社会主义的敌人无论怎样企图分裂社会主义阵营的团结，也无论他们怎样幻想离间社会主义各国，使这些国家分别单独地向社会主义前进，这些幻想和企图都是注定要失败的。
    正在建设社会主义和坚定地站在马克思列宁主义立场的各国的团结一致，是任何人都动摇不了的。
    各社会主义兄弟国家，经常发展它们的合作形式，并使之日益完善。它们之间的关系是建筑在完全平等的原则上的。这种合作的社会主义性质，可以使之更合理地安排它们之间的经济关系。
    1957年11月6日，毛泽东同志在苏联最高苏维埃的庆祝会议上曾正确地说道，自从有历史以来，任何国家间的关系，都不可能像社会主义国家间这样休戚与共，这样互相尊重和互相信任，这样互相援助和互相鼓舞。
    社会主义阵营各国间的兄弟般联系一天天更加巩固，毫无疑问，其结果会使整个社会主义阵营的团结和力量更加巩固壮大，使每个社会主义国家的经济发展速度更快，人民生活水平提高得也更快。正像一句中国的谚语所说，“三人一条心，黄土变成金。”
    满怀信心沿社会主义建设道路前进的伟大的中国人民，对巩固社会主义阵营的事业做出了无可估计的贡献。
    中华人民共和国九年来在发展经济、文化和科学方面的巨大成就，使整个社会主义阵营的人民欢欣鼓舞。中华人民共和国九周年的节日，不仅是中国人民的伟大节日，而且也成为了所有社会主义国家的共同节日。
    社会主义阵营各国在经济发展中所获得的巨大成就，明显地证实了马克思列宁主义战无不胜的思想的伟大力量。（附图片）
