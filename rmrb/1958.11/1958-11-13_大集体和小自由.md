Large Collective and Small Freedom
　　Cheng Pu

　　Public canteens have already become widespread in the countryside. For the past small family-based cooking units, public canteens are a large collective in people's lives. In the work of public canteens, there is a problem of how to appropriately consider the individual needs of commune members under the premise that they obey the collective.

　　There is no doubt that the establishment of public canteens is primarily to solve major problems that were not solved in the past: on the one hand, to provide more favorable conditions for organizing collective production; on the other hand, it also brings great benefits to every family, because it frees countless housewives from the status of "prisoners of housework" (Lenin's words) and obtains the actual conditions to participate in social labor equally with men. These can be said to be the great convenience and great freedom that public canteens provide to people. Then, in addition to this, can we provide commune members with some small conveniences and small freedoms? For example, in the past, almost every farmer's family had to make some pickles, pickled vegetables, broad bean sauce, chili sauce, fermented bean curd, and other side dishes. Farmers regarded using these kinds of side dishes with meals as a hobby and enjoyment. Now that public canteens have been established, is it still necessary to take care of the masses' habits and hobbies? In fact, many canteens have already done so. For example, some canteens prepare some side dishes for commune members in addition to the main dishes; some public canteens allow commune members to make their own side dishes at home and provide them with some assistance in this regard as much as possible. More than 500 canteens under the Wan Chun People's Commune in Wenjiang County, Sichuan Province, are doing this. These canteens also try their best to provide convenience to commune members in some other small matters: such as preparing boiling water and hot water, so that commune members can take hot water home to drink when they return from work, and also have hot water to wash their feet; sending tea and water to commune members working in the fields; allowing commune members to take meals home to eat, or allowing the whole family to dine together at the canteen, and so on. It seems that these are all minor details, but they make more people feel convenient and comfortable. These practices not only do not detract from the large collective of the public canteen, but also can enhance the connection between the public canteen and the masses. It can be seen that the large collective and small freedoms are not mutually exclusive.

　　Here, the key issue is whether we care about the commune members and whether we pay attention to the different needs of each commune member. With the establishment of public canteens and the implementation of the grain supply system or food supply system, everyone's eating problem is guaranteed. This is a remarkable thing. However, this is not enough. People's needs and hobbies will never be completely the same. As the organizer of the masses' lives, the people's commune should satisfy people's different needs as much as possible and take care of people's different hobbies in a thoughtful manner, so that the broad masses feel that the collective organization is always caring for them and providing them with all kinds of conveniences. The purpose of our building socialism and communism is not to make people's lives monotonous, but to make people's lives more and more rich and colorful. To think that the collectivization of life is simply averaging and uniformity, and thus can sweep aside the differences in people's needs and hobbies, is a misunderstanding of socialism and communism. Collective life under the socialist and communist systems should not only have commonality, but also individuality. In the socialist and communist collective organizations, the organization and discipline of life should be harmoniously unified with the diversity and vitality of life, and this can only be achieved in socialist and communist society.

    大集体和小自由
    程浦
    公共食堂已经在农村里普遍开办起来，对于过去的一家一户的小伙食单位来说，公共食堂是人们生活上的一个大集体。在公共食堂工作中有一个问题，就是如何在社员服从集体的前提下，适当照顾社员的个人要求。
    没有疑问，成立公共食堂，首先是为了解决过去没有解决的大问题：一方面，给组织集体生产提供更有利的条件；另方面，也给每个家庭带来了巨大的福利，因为它使无数家庭妇女摆脱了“家务事的俘虏”（列宁语）的地位，获得了与男子平等地参加社会劳动的实际条件。这些可以说是公共食堂给人们提供的大方便大自由。那末除此之外，能不能再给社员个人提供一些小方便小自由呢？比如过去差不多每个农家都要做点咸菜、泡菜、豆瓣酱、辣椒酱、糟豆腐之类的小菜，农民们把用这类小菜伴餐，看做是一种爱好和享受。成立了公共食堂，是不是还需要照顾群众这种习惯和爱好呢？事实上许多食堂已经这样做了。例如有些食堂在做主菜之外，还给社员们准备了一些小菜；有些公共食堂允许社员自己在家里做小菜，并且尽可能在这方面给社员一些帮助。四川省温江县万春人民公社所属五百多个食堂就是这样做的。这些食堂在别的一些小事情上也尽量给社员以方便：像准备开水、热水，让社员劳动回来可以打开水回家喝，也有热水洗脚；给在田间劳动的社员送茶送水；允许社员把饭菜打回家去吃，也可以让全家在食堂里同桌共餐，等等。看来这都是些细枝末节，但却使更多的人感到方便，舒服。这些做法不但无损于公共食堂这个大集体，而且可以增进公共食堂同群众的联系。可见大集体和小自由并不是水火不相容的。
    这里，问题的关键在于是不是关心社员，是不是注意到每个社员有着不同的需要。办起了公共食堂，实行了粮食供给制或伙食供给制，每个人的吃饭问题都有了保证。这是了不起的事情。然而这还不够。人们的需要和爱好任何时候都不会完全相同的，作为群众生活的组织者的人民公社，应当尽可能多方面地满足人们的不同需要，周到地照顾人们的不同爱好，使广大群众感到集体组织时刻在关怀着他们，在给他们以种种方便。我们建设社会主义和共产主义的目的，不是使人们的生活单调起来，而是使人们的生活越来越丰富多彩。以为生活集体化，就是简单的平均和划一，因而可以一笔抹杀人们的需要上、爱好上的差异，那是对于社会主义和共产主义的误解。社会主义和共产主义制度下的集体生活，不仅应当有共性，也应当有个性。在社会主义和共产主义的集体组织中，生活的组织性、纪律性和生活的多样性、活泼性应当得到和谐的统一，而且也只有在社会主义和共产主义社会才能做到这点。
