Conquering Old Dragon Pool, Diverting Water to Irrigate Guanshan
By our reporter Ma Yuping

In Jingyuan County, in the Liupan Mountains of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, there is a place called Old Dragon Pool, which is the source of the Jing River. The Jing River roars and rushes out from a precipitous gorge over a hundred meters high, forming a huge waterfall that flows into the unfathomable Old Dragon Pool. In the past, a legend was spread among the local Hui people: Old Dragon Pool was where Wei Zheng of the Tang Dynasty beheaded the old Dragon King of the Jing River. One year, a performance of "Wei Zheng Beheading the Old Dragon King" was staged in a village near Old Dragon Pool, angering the Old Dragon King, who sent down a hailstorm that destroyed the crops. Anyone who went to Old Dragon Pool and fell into the water would drown. From then on, no one dared to go to Old Dragon Pool again. What is written below is the story of how the Hui people, during the construction of water conservancy projects this year, broke through superstitious ideas, battled Old Dragon Pool, and diverted water to irrigate Guanshan.

Jingyuan County is home to over 40,000 Hui people. Before 1956, there was not a single mu of irrigated land, and the crops were often hit by drought every year. Last winter, during the large-scale construction of water conservancy projects, the Hui people boldly envisioned diverting water from Old Dragon Pool to irrigate over 40,000 mu of dry land on Guanshan. However, some people brought up the superstitious legends of Old Dragon Pool, believing that water conservancy projects should not be built there. But could Old Dragon Pool be conquered? Could the Jing River water reach Guanshan? This was the decisive key to realizing water conservancy in Jingyuan. Ma Sizhi, the Secretary of the Jingyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, and many other cadres went to Old Dragon Pool many times to inspect the cliffs and precipices. Finally, they proposed the action slogan "Jing River water to Guanshan, 220,000 mu (the entire county's cultivated land) of dry land to become irrigated land, five mu of irrigated land per person" to the people of the county. Some Hui people who previously did not believe that water conservancy projects could be built on Old Dragon Pool also broke through their superstitious ideas after discussion. Thus, the project to conquer Old Dragon Pool began in March of this year.

To divert water from the gorge of Old Dragon Pool up the mountain, where the cliffs rise into the clouds, making it impossible to divert water directly, it was decided to open a canal upstream of Old Dragon Pool, drill a 200-meter-long tunnel through the Dragon King Bian on the side of Old Dragon Pool, and then follow the cliffs, passing through dangerous places such as Tiger's Mouth, Green Stone Bian, Stone Water Cliff, and Great Sand Flow, to reach the mountain. This was called diverting Old Dragon Pool water through the "Five Passes." Diverting Dragon Pool water through the "Five Passes" was a bold plan. After the plan was finalized, young water conservancy technicians Zhang Bingjin and Chen Naiyu climbed the cliffs to take measurements. In some places, there was simply no place to put the instruments, and the wild trees on the mountainside often blocked their view. They used their bodies to press down the treetops to take measurements. On the cliffs, one person would go up first, put down the instrument, and then drag the other person up. In some places, they used ropes tied around their waists, using people to hang and insert the measuring rod on the cliffs.

When the water conservancy army composed of Hui people gathered at Old Dragon Pool, more than 20 Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members first faced the cliffs and swore, "If water does not come out of Dragon Pool, we will not leave the stone mountain." Yu Jinxiang, the director of the Longtan Agricultural Cooperative, was the first to climb the cliff, digging out footholds for the people behind him. Some people tied ropes around their waists and hung in mid-air to cut stones and blast. Even the 60-year-old Hui elder, Ye Huichuan, wanted to go up the mountain to dig stones. The stones in these places were too hard to move, and canals could not be built on the sand flows. People used artillery to blast the hard stones and build canals, but they would be filled in one night by stones and sand flows. People digging canals below also risked being killed by stones. Therefore, at the start of construction, special personnel were stationed on the side to keep watch. When they saw large stones about to roll down the mountain, they would immediately shout to warn the canal diggers to quickly build stone walls to block the sand and lay stones to prevent leaks. Where the canal passed through the Great Sand Flow, the entire area from the root of the mountain to the top was filled with loose sand and large stones. When there was a strong wind or rain, large stones would roll down from the gully, and people would dodge them and continue to work. In this way, one pass after another was conquered by the heroes.

At the construction site, one could often see Liu Zhenjiang, the deputy director of the County Agricultural Construction Bureau and a Communist Party member. He often waded through the waist-deep Jing River in the dark of night and climbed hundreds of meters of steep mountain peaks to lead the construction. To ensure that the laborers had their meals on time, he once carried food on his back for them from more than ten li away in the pouring rain. Digging a 200-meter-long tunnel in the Dragon King Bian was the most arduous pass in the entire project. Dozens of stonemasons were transferred from the county, but they had only ever ground millstones and made millstones before. They had never even seen a stone mountain tunnel. What to do? Liu Zhenjiang personally led everyone to explore how to drill blast holes and load explosives, enabling the laborers to quickly master blasting techniques. After several months of hard work, the Dragon King Bian was opened, and the treacherous Old Dragon Pool was conquered. Soon, the entire canal will be completed, and the Jing River water will, according to the will of the people, irrigate the dry land of Guanshan.

    征服老龙潭  引水上关山
    本报记者　马玉平
    在宁夏回族自治区六盘山区的泾源县，有个老龙潭，它是泾河的发源地。泾水从一百多公尺高的峭壁峡谷中咆哮奔流而出，汇成巨大的瀑布，流入深度莫测的老龙潭中。以前，当地回族人民中流传着这样一段神话：老龙潭是唐朝魏征斩泾河老龙王的地方。有一年，老龙潭附近村镇上唱了一出“魏征斩老龙王”的戏，触怒了老龙王，下了一场冰雹，把庄稼都打光了。有人到老龙潭去，掉到水里淹死了。从此便再也没有人敢到老龙潭去了。下面要写的，就是回族人民在今年兴修水利的时候，大破迷信思想，大战老龙潭，引水上关山的经过。
    泾源县聚居着四万多回族人民，1956年前还没一亩水浇地，每年的庄稼常遭旱灾。去年冬天，大修水利的时候，回族人民就大胆设想，引老龙潭水灌溉关山上四万多亩旱地。但是有的人又提起老龙潭的迷信传说，认为不能在那里修水利。可是老龙潭能不能被征服？泾水能不能上关山？这是泾源实现水利化的决定关键。中共泾源县委书记马思执和许多干部曾多次到老龙潭，在悬崖绝壁上察看，最后向全县人民提出“泾水上关山，二十二万亩
  （全县耕地）旱地变水地，每人五亩水浇地”的行动口号。过去不相信能在老龙潭上修水利的一些回族人民，经过讨论后也破除了迷信思想。这样，征服老龙潭的工程就在今年3月开始了。
    要从老龙潭峡谷中引水上山，而峡谷壁峰高插入云，无法引水上山，因此决定从老龙潭上游开渠口，从老龙潭侧面龙王砭钻一条二百公尺长的山洞，然后再顺着悬崖，经过老虎嘴、青石砭、石水崖、大砂流等险要的地方上山。这就叫引老龙潭的水过“五关”。引龙潭水过“五关”，是一个大胆设想的方案。方案确定以后，青年水利技术员张秉金和陈乃渝便攀上悬崖进行测量，有的地方简直连仪器都无处放，山腰里的野树常常把视线挡住，他们就用身子把树梢压住测量。在悬崖上他们先一个人上去，把仪器放下，再把另一个人拖上去。有的地方他们用绳子挂在腰里，用人吊着把标杆插在悬崖上。
    回族人民组成的水利大军在老龙潭集结的时候，二十多名共产党员、共青团员首先面对悬崖宣誓说：“水不出龙潭，人不下石山”。龙潭农业社主任于金祥第一个爬上悬崖，给后边的人挖出脚窝。有的人腰里系上绳子，吊在半空中开石方和爆破。连六十多岁的回族老汉冶惠川也要上山挖石方。这些地方石头硬得开不动，砂流又修不成渠。人们用炮击坚石，修好了渠，一个晚上就会被石头和砂流填平。人们在下面挖渠，也有被石头炸死的危险。因此开工的时候，设置专人在一边放哨，发现山上有大石头快滚下来时，就马上?喝，让挖渠的人赶紧砌石阻砂，铺石抵漏。渠道经过大砂流的地方，从山根到山顶全是虚砂和大石头，遇到大风或下雨，大块的石头就从山坳滚下来，人们躲开它又干。就这样，一个个关口都被英雄们征服了。
    工地上，经常可以看到县农建局副局长、共产党员刘振江，他常常在漆黑的夜里涉过齐腰深的泾河和攀登过几百公尺长的陡峭山峰，领导施工。他为了民工们及时吃上饭，曾经在倾盆大雨中从十几里路以外给民工们背面。在龙王砭开凿二百多公尺长的石洞，是整个工程中最艰巨的一关，从全县调来的几十个石匠，以前只会打磨子、做碾子，石山打洞，连见都没有见过。怎么办呢？刘振江就亲自带领大家摸索打炮眼、装炸药，使民工们很快掌握了爆破技术。经过几个月的苦战，龙王砭打通了，险恶的老龙潭征服了。不久，这个渠道就可全部修成，泾河水将随着人们的意志，浇灌关山的旱地。
