Leaping Forward Flowers
    Pressed and Rolled Cement Makes Thin Boards Quickly and Well Ceramic Molded Castings are Cheap and Good

    (Our Report) The Building Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Building Engineering, in collaboration with Tianjin University and Tongji University, has recently successfully trial-produced twelve different types, different materials, and different proportions of reinforced concrete pressed and rolled boards after more than twenty days of research.

    This kind of thin-walled reinforced concrete component made by the vibration pressing and rolling method can be used as wall panels, roof coverings, floor slabs, etc. in industrial and civil and other construction projects. This component has a high degree of efficiency in structure and can be used to build buildings of more than five stories. This component is accurate in size, light in weight, and is three-fifths lighter than the most economical brick wall buildings, which facilitates simplified installation on site.

    The main advantages of using the pressing and rolling method to manufacture concrete components are that the products are thin, strong, and fast to produce. As long as the poured concrete is vibrated and rolled, and then heat-treated at a temperature of about 100°C for two hours, the required 70% design strength can be obtained, and it can be immediately transported to the construction site for installation. This eliminates the need for a lot of maintenance equipment and can greatly shorten the maintenance time. Therefore, using this method can not only greatly improve the mechanization and factory production rate of assembled reinforced concrete products, but also opens up broad prospects for rapid construction.

    In the trial production process, in order to save boilers and steam pipes, the trial production unit adopted a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to create a simple earth pit curing kiln that does not require steel and has a low cost. It can maintain a temperature above 100°C and is very stable, and the heating effect is very good. It can be self-made on general construction sites and is easy to promote. Therefore, further development and creation of conditions to promote the rapid and widespread application of pressed and rolled components in construction is of great national economic significance.
    Xinhua News Agency (讯) The Foundry Research Institute of the Mechanical Manufacturing and Process Science Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machinery Industry, in the absence of data and test equipment, after nine days and nights of hard work and more than one hundred tests, has successfully completed the "ceramic mold" test. The success of this ceramic mold test has created favorable conditions for China's foundry technology to fully catch up with the world's advanced level in the future.

    Casting with ceramic molds is an advanced technology in current casting technology. Its characteristics are: convenient forming, high strength, high temperature resistance, small expansion coefficient, short production period, cheap raw materials, can be cast multiple times, and low casting cost.

    Casting with ceramic molds has a smooth surface and is suitable for precision casting of high melting point alloy castings. It can also solve the precision casting of large castings weighing several hundred kilograms that cannot be solved by general paraffin casting and thin-shell casting.

    跃进之花
    压轧水泥做薄板既快又好  陶瓷型模造铸件价廉物美
    本报讯　建筑工程部建筑科学研究院与天津大学、同济大学共同协作，经过二十多天的研究，在最近试制成功十二种不同类型、不同材料、不同配比的钢筋混凝土压轧板。
    这种以振动压轧法制成的钢筋混凝土薄壁构件，可用于工业和民用以及其他建筑工程中作为墙板、屋盖、楼板等。这种构件，在结构上具有高度的效能，完全可以用来建造五层以上的建筑物。这种构件尺寸准确，质轻比一般最经济的砖墙建筑物要轻五分之三，便于工地简化安装。
    采用压轧方法制造混凝土构件的主要优点是，制品薄，强度大，生产速度快。只要把浇好的混凝土振轧以后，经过二小时100℃左右温度下进行热处理，就能获得所需的70％设计强度，可以立即运到工地上去安装。这就不需要大量的养护设备，可以大大缩短养护时间。因此用这种方法，不仅可以大大提高装式钢筋混凝土制品的机械化工厂化的生产率，而且还为快速施工开辟了广阔的前途。
    试制单位在试制过程中，为了省去锅炉和蒸汽管道，采取土洋结合办法，自创火坑养护窖构造简单不用钢铁，成本低廉，能维持100℃以上温度，并很稳定，加热效果很好，一般工地上都能自制，易于推广。因此进一步发展和创造条件促使压轧构件迅速地广泛地应用于建筑中，是具有很大的国民经济意义的。
    新华社讯　第一机械工业部机械制造与工艺科学研究院铸造研究所在缺乏资料和试验设备的情况下，经过九昼夜的苦战和一百多次试验，已将“陶瓷型模”试验成功。这项陶瓷型模的试验成功，对我国今后铸造工艺全面赶上世界先进水平，创造了有利条件。
    用陶瓷型模进行铸造是现在铸造工艺上一项先进技术，它的特点是：成型方便、强度高、能耐高温、膨胀系数小，并且生产用期短，原料便宜，能实行多次浇铸，和铸造成本低廉。
    用陶瓷型模进行铸造，表面光洁，适于精密铸造高熔点合金铸件，还可以解决一般石腊铸造及薄壳铸造不能解决的几百公斤重的大型铸件的精密铸造。
