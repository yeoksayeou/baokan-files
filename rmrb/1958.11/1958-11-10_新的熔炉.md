    The merger of Nanjing No. 33 Middle School and Nanjing Telecommunications Instrument Factory into a single entity, combining factory and school with a half-work, half-study system, is a good model for integrating education and productive labor. It resolves the difficulties students face in finding suitable arrangements for work-study programs in factories, and addresses the challenges small factories face with limited staff and workers lacking opportunities for learning. Last semester, No. 33 Middle School organized nine production groups within the school, including electrical work, sewing, and chemical production, and also partnered with fourteen external production units for work-study programs. Teachers were busy with coordination and management, unable to participate in labor themselves, and unable to strengthen education and guidance for students. Factories, unable to provide meticulous and appropriate arrangements based on students' age, physical strength, knowledge, and experience, often produced defective products and encountered accidents. Workers in production were eager to learn but lacked the means. They also lacked confidence in carrying out technological revolutions. Now, with the factory-school merger, the difficulties of both the factory and the school are readily solved. It can be said that the factory-school merger is a necessity for both the factory and the school, and also a requirement for the development of production.

    To ensure that junior high school students in the half-work, half-study system do not affect their learning of basic courses, curriculum reforms have been implemented. Content similar to that taught in elementary and high school has been removed from the curriculum, the teaching time for minor subjects has been appropriately reduced, and the teaching time for major subjects has been increased. New courses related to production have been added. In assessments, students' answers exceeded the scope of the teacher's explanations and showed development, and the speed of their intellectual growth surprised the teachers. This means that although the time children spend in education is halved in the half-work, half-study system, they learn as much, and often more.

    Some people also say that after the factory-school merger, one party will inevitably be "swallowed up." As it stands, workers urgently need cultural and theoretical guidance in production, which will inevitably lead to a gradual increase in workers' study time. Students, under the guidance of the Party's educational policy, have demonstrated the unparalleled superiority of combining education with productive labor, and will certainly not return to the old path of only studying and not working. This means that neither production nor learning will "swallow up" the other. The issue lies in arranging labor time and study time appropriately. In the future, workers will be students, and students will also be workers, and everyone will become new people of the communist society.

    In the new furnace of the factory-school merger, we can anticipate that it will forge new types of communist builders who are both literate and martial, and both red and expert.

    新的熔炉

    南京市第三十三中学与南京电讯仪表厂实行厂校合并，厂校一家，半工半读，是目前教育和生产劳动相结合中的一种好形式，解决了学生在工厂勤工俭学中得不到适当安排和小厂人少力薄工人得不到学习等困难。三十三中上学期搞勤工俭学，校内组织了电工、缝纫、化工等九个生产组，校外又与十四个生产单位挂勾。教师忙于联系管理，自己也不能参加劳动，也不能加强对学生的教育和指导。工厂又不能按照学生的年龄、体力、知识、经验等给以细致妥善的安排、常常出废品和事故。在生产中工人迫切要求学习，但无力解决。搞技术革命也缺乏信心。现在厂校合并，工厂、学校的困难，迎刃而解。可以这样说，厂校合并，是工厂和学校本身的需要，也是生产发展的需要。
    为了使初中学生在半工半读中不影响基础课程的学习，结合教学改革，把课程中同小学和高中类同的部分删除，适量减少了副课教学时间，增加了主课教学时间，添设了联系生产的新课。在考核中，学生的解答，超出了教师讲解的范围而有所发挥，智慧增长的速度，令教师吃惊。这就是说，儿童在半工半读中虽然教育的时间少了一半，但学的东西一样多，而且往往更多。
    也有人说，厂校合并后，总有一方会被“吃掉”。就目前说，工人在生产中，迫切需要文化、理论指导，势必逐步增加工人学习时间。学生呢，在贯彻党的教育方针下，教育与生产劳动相结合，已展示了无比优越性，今后当然不会再回到老路上去光学习，不劳动。这就是说，生产学习谁也不会“吃掉”谁。问题在于把劳动时间、学习时间安排得当。将来工人是学生，学生也是工人，大家都将成为共产主义社会的新人。
    在厂校合并的新熔炉中，我们可以预期，它将会为我们冶炼出能文能武，又红又专的新型的共产主义建设者。
