Xinhua News Agency, 16th - The Ministry of Communications recently wrote to the Ministry of National Defense, expressing gratitude for the achievements made by the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the steel transportation lines over the past two months.

　　Since mid-September, various branches of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the slogan of "Exhausting All Means to Support the State in Producing More Steel, Producing Steel Quickly, and Producing Good Steel," have deployed thousands of troops to the transportation lines to transport supplies for the "Steel Commander." According to statistics, more than 8,850 vehicles have been allocated for local use, with over 300 sorties by aircraft and dozens of ships, and large numbers of horse-drawn carts, handcarts, and other transportation teams have been organized according to the needs of local Party committees, rushing day and night to carry out crash transport missions. The goal was to dispatch every available vehicle and every available person.

　　In supporting steel transportation, many units demonstrated selfless labor, altruism, and a communist spirit of considering the overall situation.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th - To gather grass and store grain for the "Steel Commander," the Chinese People's Liberation Army has achieved fruitful results in collecting scrap iron and steel. According to incomplete statistics, more than 60,000 tons have been collected by November 15th, with 60% of that being collected in the last two months.

　　Since mid-September, on the basis of supporting industry's "drought relief," various units have launched a massive upsurge in collecting scrap iron and steel. Regardless of day or night, rain or shine, as long as there was a spare moment, the vast numbers of officers and soldiers would search in groups everywhere. Soldiers of the guard company of an air force unit dug out 25 steel rails, 53 steel plates, and some broken oil tanks and scrap iron from more than a meter deep in the soil. Troops in the Shenyang area also organized a group of "reconnaissance teams," "shock teams," and "expedition teams" to collect in places dozens or hundreds of miles away, and sent diving teams to dive into the sea and the heart of the river to salvage steel. An engineering unit stationed in Andong salvaged 640 tons of steel rails and bridges from the Yalu River. Under the slogan of "Not letting go of a single piece of iron or a single needle," troops in the Nanjing area collected more than 4,100 tons of scrap iron and steel in the last forty days. Soldiers stationed in the Xiamen area on the Fujian front even used the intervals between battles to pick up a large number of enemy shell fragments and other scrap iron and steel, and recently delivered 96 tons to local industrial departments in one go.

　　Currently, various units are advancing victoriously, organizing a "second campaign," determined to work hard for forty days, striving to double the amount, and collecting 100,000 tons of scrap iron and steel by the end of the year, truly achieving "not leaving a single inch of iron behind, and collecting every ounce of steel."

    钢铁战线上解放军立大功
    千军万马支援钢铁运输  千方百计搜集废铁废钢
    据新华社16日讯　交通部最近写信给国防部，感谢两个月来中国人民解放军在钢铁运输线上建立的功勋。
    从9月中旬起，中国人民解放军各兵种部队在“千方百计支援国家多出钢，快出钢，出好钢”的口号下，千军万马开上了运输线，为“钢帅”运送粮草。据统计，调给地方使用的汽车有八千八百五十多台，出动飞机三百多架次，舰艇数十只，并且根据地方党委的需要，组织了大批的马车队，架子车队和其它运输队，星夜兼程，突击运输。作到了有一车出一车，有一人出一人。
    在支援钢铁运输当中，许多部队表现了忘我劳动，舍己为人，照顾整体的共产主义风格。
    据新华社16日讯　为“钢帅”聚草囤粮，中国人民解放军搜集废钢铁获得丰硕战果。据不完全统计，到11月15日，已搜集了六万多吨，其中60％是最近两个月搜集的。
    从9月中旬以来，各部队在支援工业“抗旱”的基础上，掀起了一个声势浩大的搜集废钢铁热潮。广大官兵不论白天夜晚，不管刮风下雨，只要一有空隙，就成群结队地四处寻找，空军某部警卫连的战士，在一丈多深的土里，挖出钢轨二十五根，钢板五十三块和一些破油箱、废钢铁。沈阳地区部队还组织一批“侦察队”、“突击队”、“远征队”，到几十里，几百里外的地方去搜集，并派出了潜水队潜入海底和江心打捞钢铁。驻安东的工程兵某部在鸭绿江里捞起钢轨、桥梁等六百四十吨。南京地区部队在“不放过一块铁片一根针”的口号下，最近四十多天，搜集的废钢铁四千一百多吨。福建前线驻厦门地区的战士，还利用战斗间隙，拣了大批敌人的炮弹片和其它废钢铁，最近一次就送缴给地方工业部门九十六吨。
    目前，各部队正在乘胜直前，组织“第二个战役”，决心大干四十天，力争翻一番，到年底搜集废钢铁十万吨，真正做到“寸铁不留，分钢必收”。
