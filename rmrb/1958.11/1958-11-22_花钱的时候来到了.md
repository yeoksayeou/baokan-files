    "The Time to Spend Money Has Arrived..."
    By Our Correspondent Su Lan
    On London's main streets, people are staring at the advertisements in shop windows. They tell customers: "It's easier to buy things now. Come on in! Pick out your favorite goods!" Many people are pushed through the doors of the shops by this kind of advertising. As a result, the British newspapers boast: "There are more customers in the shops now than ever before," "Business seems to be showing an optimistic outlook!"
    A wave of encouraging people to buy goods on credit in large quantities has swept through Britain.
    For the ordinary British people, due to low wages and high prices, they have to buy some necessities by installment payments. 1,227 installment companies are located throughout Britain, specializing in this line of business. The volume of transactions is quite amazing. When you see the endless stream of cars on the British roads, you wouldn't think that one million car owners owe the car company an average of 237 pounds each. An average Briton earning 15 pounds a week has to spend at least one pound and a few shillings a week to repay debts to furniture stores or radio companies. Thus, by mid-June of this year, the British people's debt to shop owners had reached a record high of 503 million pounds, an increase of 10% over last year.
    Recently, the British government announced the lifting of all restrictions on installment purchases of goods. This means that in the past, when people bought things by installment, they needed to pay a deposit of 10% to 50% in advance, and the remaining amount owed was repaid weekly or monthly within one or two years. Now, these regulations have all been abolished. You can buy goods on credit with little or no deposit, and the repayment time for the remaining amount owed has also been greatly extended.
    The British government's lifting of restrictions on installment payments to "prosper" the economy with purchasing power that exceeds people's ability to buy is a case of killing the chicken to get the eggs. Everyone knows that Britain's current economic situation is very bad, and the number of unemployed people is increasing sharply, which is causing the British authorities a great deal of worry. In the face of such a bleak scene, the British government has to take many measures to rob Peter to pay Paul. Since May, bank interest rates have been lowered several times. Investment in certain sectors has also been reduced repeatedly. And the recent lifting of restrictions on installment payments is considered "the fastest way to see results."
    No matter how the British newspapers promote and advocate the government's "benevolent policy," in a capitalist society where everything is for profit, these measures that benefit the monopoly capitalist groups can only be based on sacrificing the interests of the working people. Of course, it cannot stop the development of the British economic crisis.
    For a long time, the installment system has been one of the tools to exploit and shackle the British people. But the capitalists have made huge profits from it, because when you buy an item, you have to pay at least 10% interest per year. For example, if an item is worth 100 pounds, if you buy it by installment, plus handling fees and interest, then the final amount you pay is not 100 pounds, but nearly 140 pounds. The current reduction of the deposit and the extension of the payment time will make you pay more interest. It can be seen from this that the abolition of installment payment restrictions actually raises commodity prices, thereby strengthening the exploitation of people with lower purchasing power. An even greater threat is that, for whatever reason, once the purchaser stops repaying the debt, the store has the right to take away the goods you purchased. Of course, you cannot use these things for nothing. At this time, you must pay a very large rental fee for the goods. This fee is sometimes as high as more than half the price of the goods themselves, and some people end up losing both money and goods.
    The British installment companies use this method to extract 15% to 20% interest from each customer. Of course, the seven major companies benefit the most. As early as September, when installment payment restrictions were relaxed, some British newspapers predicted that the amount of people's debt would increase by another 50 million pounds by next year. Now the installment payment restrictions have been completely abolished. So the time has come for the British people to "spend more money."
    At this time, the major British banks have entered the installment payment market and launched a battle for customers with the installment companies. The five major British banks have successively adopted some special measures. For example, Midland Bank has combined with the seven major companies to squeeze out all other small and medium-sized installment companies. The British government, which has close ties with the big banks, has recently adopted a policy of easing credit, and bank interest rates have fallen from 7% to 4.5%. The newspapers representing the financial oligarchs are helping from the sidelines: "Use loans to defeat installment payments," "Midland Bank helps you buy a car, repair your house..."
    The banks' participation in the installment business is due to two reasons. One is that the installment companies are extracting a lot of profit from the people, which makes the banking industry covetous. They claim that the installment business is very profitable and should not be left to these companies to handle alone. More importantly, the development of the British economic crisis has greatly reduced the demand for the development of industrial capital. In order to keep their capital circulating and maintain their profits, the major banks have decided to "lend" their money to British consumers. Due to the reduction of interest rates on private loans, the British people can now get loans from banks to directly buy goods on credit. In this way, it is said that the interest paid is less than the interest paid for buying goods on credit by installment. But it should be pointed out that it is difficult for some Britons without guaranteed income to get bank loans. The British government wants to empty the people's wallets and consume all of the people's purchasing power in the next few years now. They think that by using this method of expanding people's debts, they can create a "prosperity" in the market, thereby stopping the development of the economic crisis. However, this will not improve Britain's current economic situation, it only proves the British authorities' serious worries about the British economic crisis. The "Financial Times" once said pessimistically: "The measure of abolishing installment payment restrictions will not affect the unemployment problem," "Undoubtedly, the most worrying thing is the growth of unemployment." The Governor of the Bank of England also expressed doubts about the so-called current optimistic economic basis. He said: "Today's optimism may be tomorrow's inflation." (Attached picture)

### “花钱的时候来到了……”

    “花钱的时候来到了……”
    本报记者　苏蓝
    在伦敦的主要街道上，人们凝视着商店橱窗里的广告。它告诉顾客：“现在买东西更容易了。请进来吧！挑选你最喜爱的货物！”许多人被这种宣传推进了商店的大门。于是，英国的报纸鼓吹说：“现在商店中的顾客比以往任何时候都多”，“商业似乎出现了乐观的景象！”
    一个号召人们大量以分期付款赊购货物的浪潮已席卷英国。
    对英国普通人民来说，由于工资的低微和物价的昂贵，他们不得不以分期付款的办法来购买一些必需品，一千二百二十七个赊购公司遍于全英各地，专干这行买卖。其交易额之大，颇为惊人。当你看到英国马路上川流不息的汽车时，你不会想到，其中有一百万辆汽车的主人，每人平均还欠汽车公司二百三十七英镑。而一个平均每周收入十五镑的英国人，他每周至少要拿出一镑几先令去偿还家具店或无线电公司的债务。就这样，到今年6月中旬，英国人民欠商店老板的债务，已达五亿零三百万镑的最高纪录，比去年增加了10％。
    最近，英国政府宣布取消对分期付款购买货物的一切限制。这就是说，过去人民以分期付款来买东西时，需要事先付10％到50％的押金，其余欠额则按周或按月在一、二年内还清。现在，这种规定一概取消了。你可以少付或不付押金来赊购商品，其余欠款的偿还时间也大大延长了。
    英国政府取消对分期付款的限制，以超过人们购买能力的购买力来“繁荣”经济，这是杀鸡取蛋的办法。谁都知道，英国目前的经济情况非常不妙，失业人数不断猛烈增加，使英国当局大伤脑筋。在这样一副惨淡的景象面前，英国政府不得不采取许多挖肉补疮的措施。从5月份以来，银行的利率数度降低。对某些部门的投资也一再减少。而最近取消对分期付款的限制，则被认为是“可以最快见效的措施”。
    不管英国报纸对政府这一“德政”，如何进行宣传、鼓吹。在一切为了利润的资本主义社会中，这些有利于垄断资本集团的措施，只能以牺牲劳动人民的利益为前提。当然，它也不能制止英国经济危机的发展。
    长期以来，分期付款制度就是剥削和束缚英国人民的工具之一。而资本家却从中赚取了高额利润，因为，当你买进一种物品时，每年却要付出至少10％的利息。比方说，一件价值一百镑的商品，如果以分期付款来购买，加上手续费和利息，那末你最后付出的已不是一百镑，而是将近一百四十镑。目前押金的降低和付款时间的延长，就将使你付出更多的利息。由此可以看出，取消分期付款的限制，实际上是提高了商品价格，从而对购买力较低的人加强了剥削。更大的威胁还在于：不管为了什么原因，购买者一旦中断偿还欠款，商店就有权力把你所购买的货物拿走。当然，你不能白白地使用这些东西，这时，你必须付出一笔非常大的货物出租费用。这种费用有时高达货物本身价格的一半以上，有些人就这样落得财物两空。
    英国的赊购公司，就是以这种手段，从每一个顾客身上，榨取15％到20％的利息。当然，得利最多的要算其中的七大公司。还在今年9月分期付款限制放宽的时候，英国的一些报纸就预测人民负债的数字到明年将再增加五千万镑。现在分期付款的限制已完全取消了。于是英国人民“花更多的钱的时候来临了”。
    就在这时，英国的各大银行纷纷投入分期付款市场，和赊购公司展开了争夺战。英国五大银行相继采取一些特别措施。例如密德兰银行已和七大公司结合起来，排挤所有的其它中小赊购公司。与大银行有密切联系的英国政府，最近则采取了放宽信贷的政策，银行利率从7％已下降到4.5％。代表金融寡头的报纸则从中助威：“以贷款来击败分期付款”，“密德兰银行帮助你买汽车、修理房子……”。
    银行参加了赊购业务，是由于两种原因促成的。一是各赊购公司从人民身上捞去大量油水，这使银行界垂涎三尺。他们宣称：分期付款的买卖大有利可图，不能单单让给这些公司来包办。而更重要的原因是，英国经济危机的发展，使发展工业资本的需求大大减少了。各大银行为了使他们的资本流通起来，以保持其利润，便决定把他们的钱“借”给英国消费者。由于对私人贷款利息的降低，英国人民现在可以从银行得到贷款，来直接赊买贷物。这样，据说付出的利息要比以分期付款赊购货物付出的利息少一些。但应该指出，一些收入没有保证的英国人，是很难得到银行的贷款的。英国政府要掏光人民腰包中的钞票，要把人民几年以后的购买力在目前都消耗净尽。他们以为用这种扩大人民债务的办法，就能造成市场的“繁荣”，从而制止经济危机的发展。但是，这并不能改善英国目前的经济状况，它只是证明了英国当局对英国经济危机严重的忧虑。“金融时报”就曾悲观地说：“分期付款限制取消的措施，并不能影响失业问题，”“无疑最使人忧虑的是失业的增长”。英格兰银行经理也对所谓目前经济乐观的基础表示怀疑。他说：“今天的乐观可能是明天的通货膨胀”。（附图片）
