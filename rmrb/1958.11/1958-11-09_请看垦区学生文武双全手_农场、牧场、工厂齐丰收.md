Urumqi, 8th—The children's schools in the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps' reclamation areas have established approximately fifty small farms, pastures, and factories, closely integrating the children's learning with labor. The small farms and pastures cultivate various crops, vegetables, and raise various poultry and livestock. The farmers and herdsmen of these small farms and pastures are all children. The farm directors, chief agronomists, and accountants of the small farms and pastures are also elected by the children, with counselors serving as advisors.

Since the children are all offspring of the farm soldiers, their participation in labor is encouraged and supported by their parents. With the help of the farm uncles and elders, they have reclaimed wasteland and established about fifty small farms, pastures, and small factories within the larger farms. Small farms typically cultivate dozens of mu of land, with the largest cultivating 150 mu, planting vegetables, corn, cotton, and melons. They also raise pigs, chickens, ducks, and rabbits. Some small factories produce chalk, while others produce chemical fertilizers.

The products produced by the small farms, pastures, and factories belong to the collective and are used to build schools, subsidize school cafeterias, and help students with financial difficulties. These small farms and pastures have already achieved great success in production. The Young Pioneers' horticultural farm in the Qianjin Farm, after a year of labor by the children, has achieved a bumper harvest. They harvested more than 110,000 jin of wheat and more than 20,000 heads of garlic, which solved the school's various expenses. The nine small farms in the Usu Reclamation Area, in addition to planting hundreds of mu of corn, sorghum, and vegetables, also raised 400 pigs, more than 300 chickens and ducks, and 50 rabbits. The students are now self-sufficient in vegetables and meat, and are also supplying vegetables to farm families.

In the collective labor of the small farms, the children have developed excellent qualities of love for labor. The phenomenon of children running around and making noise after school is no longer seen. The small farms have become their happy gardens in life. After participating in labor, not only have the children's academic achievements not declined, but on the contrary, they have generally improved compared to before. They have also learned many production skills, and some children have even been named young labor models.

    农场、牧场、工厂齐丰收
    乌鲁木齐8日电　新疆生产建设兵团各垦区的子女学校，已经建立起约五十个小农场、牧场和工厂，把孩子们学习和劳动紧密地结合起来了。小农场和小牧场经营着各种庄稼、蔬菜和各种家禽、牲畜，小农场和小牧场的农工和牧工，都由孩子们担任；小农场和小牧场的场长、总农艺师和会计，也都是由孩子们选举产生的，辅导员担任顾问。
    由于孩子们都是农场战士的子女，所以孩子们参加劳动受到父母们的鼓励和支持。他们在农场叔叔、伯伯们的帮助下，进行了开荒造田，在大农场中建立起约五十个小农场、小牧场和小工厂。小农场一般都种了几十亩地，最大的有种一百五十亩地的，种植着蔬菜、玉米、棉花和瓜果；饲养有猪、鸡、鸭和兔子；小工厂有的制粉笔，有的制化肥。
    小农场、牧场和工厂生产出来的产品，归集体所有，用来建设学校，补贴学校食堂和帮助经济困难同学。现在这些小农场和小牧场在生产方面已取得很大成绩。前进农场的红领巾园艺场种植的作物，经过孩子们一年劳动，获得了丰收。他们共收获了十一万多斤小麦和二万多头大蒜，解决了学校的各项费用。乌苏垦区九个小农场除种植了几百亩玉米、高粱和蔬菜，还养了四百口猪、三百多只鸡鸭和五十只兔子，学生的蔬菜、肉类都已自给，并向农场家属供应蔬菜。
    孩子们在小农场的集体劳动中，养成了热爱劳动的优良品质。过去孩子们放学后乱跑乱闹的现象再看不到了，小农场成了他们生活中的快乐园地。孩子们参加劳动后，不但学习成绩没有下降，相反地普遍比以前好了，而且还学会了很多的生产本领，有些孩子还被评为少年劳动模范。
