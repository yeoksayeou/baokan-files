Xinhua News Agency, London, 20th - The most right-wing Conservative newspaper, the "Daily Telegraph," has published three consecutive articles in the past three days describing how Americans are disliked and hated in Western Europe.

These articles were written by the newspaper's reporter, Anthony Mann, after his recent visit to nine Western European countries including Greece, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Austria, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany. The articles listed a series of anti-American incidents in the capitalist world in recent years: more than a dozen anti-American demonstrations in Paris; the bombing of the American library in Athens; the beating of U.S. Vice President Nixon in South America, and the breaking of windows in U.S. Information Service offices in many places, etc. The articles believe that these facts show that former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, George Kennan’s statement that the United States is the most scolded and hated object in the world is well-founded.

The author of the article said that in the eyes of the United States' allies, the United States acts unilaterally and disregards their interests.

The author pointed out that many Europeans are particularly strongly opposed to the U.S. foreign policy implemented by Dulles; he said: "In the nine countries I visited, not a single country voiced support for Dulles, and even professional American diplomats visibly shuddered when Dulles's name was mentioned." The author pointed out that, in general, Dulles is resented as a symbol of American foreign policy. However, he himself is also extremely unpopular. In Athens, people call him a "hypocritical liar" and a "sanctimonious hypocrite," etc.

The author said: "Dulles's rigid and even dangerously unrealistic attitude toward the Soviet Union, China, and the issue of co-existence, combined with his complete disregard for the interests of his NATO allies in all regions outside Europe, makes Europeans (referring to Western Europeans) feel terrified."

The author said that most Arabs not only regard Americans as "politically naive, but also as the most dangerous of all imperialists."

The author continued, after the Soviet satellite went into space, a mixture of surprise and schadenfreude swept across Western Europe. As a professor in Amsterdam said, it is generally believed that it is not a bad thing that the United States' scientific boasting has been deflated.

The author said that when Western Europeans watch this fleeting Secretary of State and his colleagues at work, they generally feel very worried, as if they are being carried across a bottomless abyss by Americans who are far from reliable tightrope walkers.

The author pointed out that the facts show that the 500,000 U.S. troops stationed in Western Europe find that they are far from welcome, and their country is far from popular. To the French, American troops are "barbarians." They bring American dollars, which stimulate the rise of French rents. They have ostentatious cars, and they are always boasting about how good things are across the Atlantic. But their cultural level is only that of pharmacies (Editor's note: American pharmacies sell low-level books and periodicals), yellow comic books, and jukeboxes.

In Greece, Americans think everything is dirty. Official American pamphlets warn Americans to boil all water; don't drink milk; don't touch this or that food that might be dirty. An Athenian complained that Americans even import salt and pepper from their own country. In cities such as Athens and Salonika, seeing American soldiers' uniforms is often a source of irritation.

Because the United States has failed to support Greece against Britain and Turkey on the Cyprus issue, Greeks have become convinced that the United States is disloyal.

Since the establishment of the West German government, the United States' credibility in West Germany fell to its lowest point in 1956, because American soldiers committed many crimes such as robbery, assault, and murdering prostitutes.

The main trouble the United States has encountered in Spain has been the forced requisition of land to build large airports. The Spanish people also sharply criticized the United States, saying that Franco was able to continue to rule only because of American support.

The author said that, in addition to foreign policy, there are two other things in modern American history that have been strongly condemned by all the countries I have visited: McCarthyism and the racial riots in Alabama. It seems that these two things are completely contrary to the freedom that the United States claims to respect.

### 美国是全世界最受人憎恨的国家

专栏：

    美国是全世界最受人憎恨的国家
    英国“每日电讯报”谈西欧各国的反美情绪
    作为美国外交政策象征的杜勒斯
    在西欧一些人看来是虚伪的骗子
    新华社伦敦20日电　最右翼的保守党报纸“每日电讯报”在过去三天中连续刊载了三篇文章，描写美国人如何在西欧受人讨厌和痛恨。
    这些文章是该报记者安东尼·曼最近访问了希腊、意大利、西班牙、瑞士、奥地利、法国、比利时、荷兰和西德等九个西欧国家之后写成的。文章列举了近年来资本主义世界中一连串反美事件：巴黎爆发的十多次反美示威；雅典美国图书馆被炸；美国副总统尼克松在南美挨揍，以及不少地方的美国新闻处办事处的窗玻璃被打破等等。文章认为这些事实表明，前美国驻苏大使凯南关于美国是全世界最受人责骂和憎恨的对象的说法是有根据的。
    文章的作者说，在美国的盟国看来，美国一意孤行，丝毫不顾及它们的利益。
    作者指出，许多欧洲人特别激烈反对杜勒斯所执行的美国外交政策；他说：“在我所访问的九个国家里，没有一个国家发出赞成杜勒斯的声音，甚至美国的职业外交家在提到杜勒斯的名字时也显然打寒噤”。作者指出，总的说来，杜勒斯是作为美国外交政策的象征而受人憎厌的。但是，他本人也极不得人心。在雅典，人们称他为“虚伪的骗子”和“道貌岸然的伪君子”等等。
    作者说：“杜勒斯在对待苏联、中国和共处问题上所采取的那种僵硬甚至危险地脱离实际的态度，和他在欧洲以外所有地区丝毫不顾他的北大西洋公约组织盟国的利益，合在一起使欧洲人（指西欧人）感到毛骨悚然。”
    作者说，大多数阿拉伯人不仅把美国人看成“在政治上是幼稚的，而且是一切帝国主义者中间最危险的”。
    作者接着说，在苏联卫星上天以后，在整个西欧出现了一种大吃一惊和幸灾乐祸交织在一起的情绪。正像阿姆斯特丹某教授所说的那样，人们普遍认为美国在科学方面的吹牛泄了气，倒并不是一件坏事。
    作者说，当西欧人注视着这个来去匆匆的国务卿和他的同僚在工作时，他们普遍产生了一种非常担心的感觉，就仿佛他们是被美国人抱着跨过无底深渊，而这些美国人却远不是可靠的走高空钢索的演员。
    作者指出，事实表明，美国驻在西欧的五十万军队发现他们远不是受欢迎的人，而他们的国家也远不是得人心的。对法国人来说，美国军队是“野蛮人”。他们把美金带来，刺激法国房租上涨。他们有神气活现的汽车，他们老是自我吹嘘和夸耀大西洋彼岸的东西如何如何好。但是他们的文化水平却只是药房（编者按：美国的药房附带出卖低级的书刊）、黄色连环画册和自动留声机的文化水平。
    在希腊，美国人认为希腊人的每样东西都是脏的。在美国官方印发的小册子中警告美国人必须把所有的水都煮过；不要喝牛奶；不要碰这种或那种可能是脏的食物。一个雅典人抱怨说：美国人甚至连盐和胡椒都从国内运来。在雅典和萨罗尼加等城市里，看到美国军人的制服经常是惹人生气的根由。
    由于美国在塞浦路斯问题上没有能够支持希腊对付英国和土耳其，已经使希腊人相信美国是不忠实的。
    自从西德政府成立以来，美国在西德的信誉在1956年降到了最低点，因为当时美国军人犯了许多抢窃、殴打和谋杀妓女等罪行。
    美国在西班牙遇到的主要麻烦一直是强迫征用土地来建造大飞机场的问题。西班牙人民也尖锐地抨击美国，他们说，佛朗哥只是由于美国的支持才得以继续执政的。
    作者说：除了外交政策以外，在近代美国历史上还有两样东西受到我所访问过的所有国家的强烈谴责，那就是：麦卡锡主义和亚拉巴马州的种族主义骚乱。看来这两样东西同那些美国自称尊重的自由是完全相反的。
