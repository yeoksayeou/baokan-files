Urumqi, November 8th (electric dispatch) – The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is organizing a large-scale effort to conquer the desert. A plan for conquering the desert has been formulated. By the end of next year, the Autonomous Region will build a green great wall covering approximately 15 million mu along the 1,200-plus li wind and sand line on the southern edge of the Junggar Basin. Currently, the first step in conquering the desert, the collection of tree seeds, is being intensified. Since late October, most of the twelve counties along the line, from Mulei Kazakh Autonomous County in Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture in the east to Wenquan County in Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture in the west, have dispatched farmer expeditions totaling approximately 5,000 people to collect desert tree seeds, mainly Haloxylon, in the vast desert. The Autonomous Region Forestry Department has also dispatched five working groups to teach seed collection techniques to farmers of all ethnic groups. This year, the plan is to collect more than 10 million jin of desert tree seeds, requiring more than 3 million labor days. Farmer expeditions from various places have generally set up tents or built cellars, bringing provisions, and preparing to fight hard for a month to complete the arduous seed collection task. Recently, more than 900 farmers in Changji County have been collecting 20,000 jin of seeds every day.

The desert area in Xinjiang accounts for half of the country's desert area, approximately 370,000 square kilometers. For thousands of years, the desert has been the deadly enemy of people of all ethnic groups. It has devoured many prosperous ancient towns and fertile fields. "Declaring war on the desert" has been a dream of people of all ethnic groups, but one that could not be realized in the past. In order to carry out an organized attack on the desert, this spring the Xinjiang Academy of Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Sciences conducted a survey and research on direct seeding of desert tree species and desert plants in Jinghe County on the edge of the desert. They found 97 kinds of plants in 192 square kilometers of desert and gained experience in direct seeding of Haloxylon. After July, the Autonomous Region held forestry collaboration meetings in Urumqi and Yining in northern Xinjiang, and Kashgar in southern Xinjiang, respectively, to determine the afforestation tasks. Before collecting seeds, the Forestry Department and other relevant units also dispatched reconnaissance teams to investigate the distribution of desert plant germplasm resources and suitable afforestation areas in the Junggar Basin, and found that the available Haloxylon seeds reached 29.16 million jin.

The project of building a desert forest in the Junggar Basin is very arduous. Because the desert is vast and it is very difficult to walk, the Autonomous Region decided to mainly use airplanes to sow seeds, supplemented by horses and camels to sow seeds, with the sky and land attacking the desert simultaneously. This organized attack on the desert is the first time in Xinjiang's history. It can not only change the arid climate in northern Xinjiang, prevent the desert from moving south, protect the farmland in Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, the granary of the Autonomous Region, the cotton fields on both sides of the Manas River, the construction of the Karamay Oilfield, and the safe operation of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway in the future, but also provide a large amount of wood for fuel and open up new agricultural and pastoral bases. Calculated at two livestock raised per mu of sandy wasteland forest, 15 million mu of land can raise 30 million livestock.

    新疆采集树种营造防沙绿长城
    将到来的场面：“飞机骏马齐出动，空中陆地两夹攻”
    乌鲁木齐8日电　新疆维吾尔自治区正在组织规模巨大的征服沙漠的工作。征服沙漠的规划已经制定出来，到明年底，自治区将在准噶尔盆地南缘一千二百多华里的风沙线上，营造一条占地约一千五百万亩的绿色长城。目前，征服沙漠的第一步的采集树种工作正在加紧进行。10月下旬，东自昌吉回族自治州的木垒哈萨克族自治县，西止博尔塔拉蒙古族自治州的温泉县，沿线十二个县大部分已派遣农民远征队共约五千多人进入黄沙莽莽的沙漠中采集以梭梭为主的沙漠树种。自治区林业厅也派遣了五个工作组向各族农民传授采种技术。今年计划采集沙漠树种一千多万市斤，共需要三百多万劳动工日。各地农民远征采种队已普遍支撑起了帐篷或修筑了地窖，带着给养，准备苦战1月，完成繁重的采种任务。昌吉县九百多个农民最近每天已采种两万斤。
    新疆沙漠面积占全国沙漠的一半，约有三十七万平方公里。千百年来沙漠一直是各民族人民的死敌。它曾经吞食了古代许多繁荣的城镇和肥沃的田园。“向沙漠宣战”，这是各族人民过去一直梦想着但却无法实现的事情。为了对沙漠开展有组织的进攻，今年春天新疆农牧科学研究所在沙漠边缘的精河县进行了直播沙漠树种和沙漠植物的调查研究工作。他们在一百九十二平方公里的沙漠上就找到各地植物九十七种，并且取得了直播梭梭的经验。7月以后，自治区分别在北疆的乌鲁木齐，伊宁以及南疆的喀什，召开了林业协作会议，确定了造林任务。林业厅等有关单位在采种前还派遣侦察组侦察了准噶尔盆地沙漠植物种原分布状况和宜林地带的调查，发现可采的梭梭种籽，就达两千九百一十六万市斤。
    在准噶尔盆地营造荒沙林工程非常艰巨。因为黄沙莽莽，行走非常困难，自治区决定以飞机撒种为主，骑马和骑骆驼撒种为附，天空和陆地同时向沙漠进攻。这样有组织地向沙漠进攻，在新疆的历史上还是第一次。它不仅可以改变新疆北部的干旱的气候，防止沙漠南迁，保护自治区的粮仓昌吉回族自治州的农田，玛纳斯河两岸的棉田，克拉玛依油田的建设，以及将来兰新铁路的安全行车，而且还可以提供大量用作薪炭的木材和开辟新的农牧业基地。以每亩沙荒林饲养两头牲畜计算，一千五百万亩地就可饲养三千万头牲畜。
