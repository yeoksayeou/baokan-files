Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: Tokyo - Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, while inspecting the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" on the 1st, clamored that "Japan's military strength must be strengthened." He said that Japan needs a stronger force to "deal with direct and indirect aggression."

The 1st was the eighth anniversary of the establishment of the Japanese army. Nobusuke Kishi, who is full of imperialist ambitions and is stepping up the restoration of Japanese militarism, inspected the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" at the Meiji Jingu Gaien in Tokyo. Approximately 4,300 Japanese army, navy, and air force troops participated in the review. Military equipment appearing in the review included howitzers, anti-aircraft guns, and heavy tanks. Japanese Air Force planes, including American-made Sabre jets, flew past in formation.

The "Self-Defense Forces" have now become a regular, modern force in Japan. The army alone has 170,000 infantry troops. If you add the 130,000 militarily trained police, Japan now has more than 300,000 trained soldiers capable of combat.

At the same time, the Japanese Navy already has more than 100 warships, including destroyers, minesweepers, and submarines.

The Kishi Nobusuke government is currently trying its best to expand Japan's military power. The military expenditure in Japan's draft budget for the next fiscal year will reach 149.583 billion yen, an increase of 30% over this year. According to the outline of the expansion plan announced by the Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force headquarters in June this year, Japan will increase the army to 180,000 people in fiscal year 1959, increase the navy's strength to more than 124,000 tons, and increase the air force's aircraft to 1,300.

The arms expansion plan formulated by the Kishi Nobusuke government in coordination with the United States' strategic deployment and plans in the Far East pays special attention to arming the "Self-Defense Forces" with the latest rocket weapons. The Kishi Nobusuke government has already purchased "Oerlikon" missile samples in Switzerland and is preparing to manufacture missiles in Japan. In addition, Japan has also purchased "Sidewinder" missiles from the United States.

    配合美国战争部署　加紧准备侵略炮灰
    岸信介叫嚣加强军事力量
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介1日在检阅日本“自卫队”时，叫嚷“必须加强日本的军事力量”。他说，日本需要更强大的部队，来“对付直接的和间接的侵略”。
    1日是日本军队成立八周年。满怀帝国主义野心而在加紧恢复日本军国主义的岸信介，在东京明治神宫外苑检阅了日本“自卫队”。大约有四千三百名日本陆、海、空军部队参加了检阅。在检阅中出现的军事装备包括有榴弹炮、高射炮和重型坦克。包括美制佩刀式飞机在内的日本空军的飞机列队飞过。
    “自卫队”目前已经成为日本的正规的现代化部队。这支军队光是步兵就有十七万人。如果加上十三万受军事训练的警察，日本现在已经有三十多万经过训练的可以作战的士兵。
    与此同时，日本海军已经拥有一百多艘军舰，其中包括驱逐舰、扫雷舰、潜水艇等。
    岸信介政府目前还在极力扩充日本的军事力量。日本在下一财政年度预算草案中的军费开支达一千四百九十五亿八千三百万日元，即比本年度增加30％。根据日本陆、海、空军总部在今年6月发表的扩军计划大纲，日本在1959年度将把陆军增加到十八万人，使海军实力超过十二万四千吨，并且使空军的飞机增加到一千三百架。
    岸信介政府配合美国在远东的战略部署和计划而制定的扩军计划，特别注意用最新式的火箭武器来武装“自卫队”。岸信介政府已经在瑞士购买了“厄利康式”导弹样品，准备由日本自己制造导弹。此外，日本还向美国购买了“响尾蛇”式导弹。
