Editor's Note: After the bankruptcy of the United States' policy of strength and brinkmanship toward China, the United States, under pressure, changed its policy toward China. This change began with Dulles' remarks to reporters on September 30. Below are excerpts from that conversation, in which Dulles discussed several related issues.

Rehashing the Old Tune of "Both Sides Abandoning the Use of Force"
Attempting to Continue Obstructing China's Liberation of Taiwan

Question: Mr. Secretary, regarding policy, you have stated on many occasions that if the Chinese Communists were willing to declare the abandonment of the use of force in the Formosa area, it would have a very beneficial effect on negotiations. Logically, does this mean that we ourselves must also issue a similar statement, stating that we will not support any armed action by the Chiang Kai-shek government against mainland China?

Answer: We clearly believe that if there is a declaration to abandon the use of force, it should be a mutual declaration. We cannot hope for a unilateral abandonment of the use of force. This should be based on the principle and condition of reciprocity.

Question: Mr. Secretary, you said twice at the beginning of this morning that U.S. policy has not changed. However, in the course of the press conference, you seem to have clarified at least two major issues, which, to my knowledge, the State Department has not publicly clarified before: the reciprocal aspect of abandoning the use of force, and the fact that the United States considers it foolish to strengthen military forces on the coastal islands, and that in some cases, they should withdraw. If these two points are as significant and important as they appear, why were they not publicly stated before?

Answer: Oh, our attitude toward either of these points is not new. I think if you—for example—study the records of our previous negotiations with the Chinese Communists, you will know that we believe that the abandonment of the use of force should be mutual, if there is to be a declaration of abandoning the use of force; it is quite impractical and quite wrong to ask the Chinese Communists to abandon the use of force when they are attacked by the Chinese Nationalists. I can say that when we talk about abandoning the use of force, it always refers to abandoning the use of force for purposes other than self-defense. Perhaps I have not stated this before. Therefore, if someone is attacked, the abandonment of the use of force naturally does not apply.

Question: Mr. Secretary, you just said that the declaration of abandoning the use of force, if realized, should be mutual. Would you consider that under this mutual agreement, Chiang Kai-shek would declare non-interference in a Hungarian-style rebellion, or would you say that once a revolution occurs in China, the mutual agreement to abandon the use of force would immediately cease?

Answer: Ah, you know, in Hungary, at least at one point, there was a government that requested outside assistance and demanded the withdrawal of the Soviet Union. If there were a recognized Chinese government requesting assistance, I would not consider that to involve armed intervention in China.

Repeatedly Criticizing Chiang Kai-shek for Maintaining Large Numbers of Troops in Kinmen and Matsu
Exerting Efforts to Promote the So-Called Conspiracy to Achieve a "Ceasefire"

Question: Mr. Secretary, a few minutes ago you mentioned the letters you exchanged with Foreign Minister Ye in December 1954. In that exchange of letters, both parties agreed that military forces—the product of the joint efforts of the two countries—should not be removed from the treaty area without the mutual consent of both parties. Do we agree with President Chiang's statement yesterday that the fortifications and strength of the coastal islands should be strengthened?

Answer: The United States does not believe it is right to undertake the obligation to use force on a large scale in these areas as the Chinese government hopes. However, given the Republic of China's firm attitude, we tacitly agreed to this view. We did not try to oppose this view. The result is—I may say—that the United States expressed tacit consent, but not approval. We did not try to oppose it after persuasive work.

Question: Mr. Secretary, since you said you do not think it is right for the Nationalist Chinese to strengthen their troops on Kinmen and Matsu, I would like to ask you if you now think it is right to formulate some arrangement to withdraw these troops from these two islands?

Answer: It all depends on the circumstances under which they withdraw. I don't think withdrawing as a retreat under attack is a wise step, because it would probably affect the morale of the people of other countries, other countries, and indeed Formosa itself.

Question: Sir, would you be willing to talk about under what circumstances you think a withdrawal could be achieved?

Answer: If there is a ceasefire in that area that looks reasonably reliable, I think it would be foolish to keep this substantial number of troops on these islands. We have previously believed that it is quite foolish to put these troops there, and as I just said, if there is a ceasefire, our judgment, even military judgment, is that it is not wise or prudent to keep these troops stationed there.

Question: Mr. Secretary, you seem to be emphasizing the need for a reliable ceasefire. You are unwilling to accept the promises of the Communists. Can you tell us how you can achieve a reliable ceasefire with the Communists?

Answer: This is certainly a very good question, and a very difficult question to answer. I think the promises of the Communists, simply because they are promises, are never reliable. Promises are only reliable when the Communists face unpleasant consequences for breaking them. And I think that we can create circumstances that make the Communists feel that the consequences of breaking such promises are so unpleasant that we can assume that they will probably abide by their promises, not because of the sanctity of promises—they do not believe in the sanctity of promises—but out of expediency.

Question: Mr. Secretary, must the ceasefire be written or unwritten? Can it be a de facto ceasefire achieved merely by ceasing fire, without anything in writing?

Answer: I think it can be de facto.

Question: Mr. Secretary, some senators seem to believe that the government is expanding the area of the security treaty with the Republic of China. They recall that you said in February to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that if you had any intention of expanding this area, you would go back to the Senate. Do you think this interpretation of our activities there is correct?

Answer: No, I don't think it's correct. The situation is that we have no legal obligation to defend the coastal islands. We do not want to undertake any such obligation. Today, we do not have this obligation. The basis for our actions is the power granted by the Joint Resolution, which is also the law of the land. This resolution says that if the President believes that defending these coastal islands is necessary or appropriate for defending the treaty area, he can use American troops for this purpose. This is how people understand it, and this is what we hope for. Today I want to say that if the United States believes that abandoning these islands would not have any adverse effect on the possible work of defending Formosa and the treaty area, we would not consider using troops there. It is precisely because under the current conditions—mainly the conditions created by the Communists—there is this relationship, there is this collateral relationship there.

Some say that the purpose of this action is not only to drive the Chinese Nationalists out of Kinmen and Matsu, but also to drive the United States out of Formosa. When the tip of a wedge, the leading tip, is driven in, and they say that they will not stop when they encounter an obstacle, but will continue to drive in, then you must judge whether letting the wedge continue to drive in one go will strengthen or weaken the defenses of the area you have guaranteed to defend. This is what we have to consider.

Question: Mr. Secretary, you just said that you think you can create circumstances so that the Communists will encounter unpleasant things if they break the ceasefire guarantee. What are you referring to? Are you saying that the allies propose some kind of joint guarantee on Formosa itself, or something else?

Answer: What I am thinking of is sanctions that may be implemented by other countries besides the United States. For example, there may be trade sanctions and so on.

Admitting that Chiang Kai-shek's Counterattack Against the Mainland is a Dream
But Again Indulging in the Delusion of Subverting Our Government

Question: Mr. Secretary: Regarding the aforementioned issue of abandoning the use of force, is the attitude of the U.S. government that the United States hopes that the Nationalist Chinese government will one day return to the Chinese mainland by force or some other means, or supports this idea?

Answer: This is a question with a lot of assumptions. I think it depends entirely on what happens on the mainland. I don't think they will return there by their own strength alone. If there is some kind of unrest and rebellion on the mainland, such as the events that broke out in Hungary, then a free China with considerable strength a few miles away could become a very important factor in the situation. I think we would all feel that if there had been a free Hungarian government less than a few miles away from Hungary when the Hungarian rebellion broke out, the development of the situation might have been different from what actually happened.

So, I am unwilling to rule out any such possibility: that some kind of situation may occur in mainland China or some areas of mainland China that may promote some kind of reunification of mainland China or that area of mainland China with the free government of China, i.e., the Republic of China now on Formosa. I do not rule out this possibility.

Question: Is this entirely based on the strength of the Formosan government, or has the United States made any explicit or implicit guarantees to provide assistance in the situation you described?

Answer: No, no guarantees have been made to provide assistance in this regard. I think you know that the only guarantee in this regard is the agreement included in the letters exchanged between the Chinese Foreign Minister and myself, which says that force should not be used from the treaty area except with an agreement between us. Therefore, neither of our two countries can use force against the mainland from the treaty area casually, unless—I think it says so—there is an urgent need for self-defense. But this exception would not include the kind of situation you are talking about.

Question: Mr. Secretary, if there is a rebellion or riot in China, do you expect its leaders to—if they are willing—hand over the leadership to Chiang Kai-shek?

Answer: I really don't think this is a question I can answer very well. It depends entirely—it depends on the nature of the revolution. I think it will probably be a revolution mainly under local auspices and local leadership. Although external cooperation and assistance may be sought, as to whether Chiang Kai-shek will be asked to return as the leader of the government, this is a hypothetical and unpredictable question. I do not rule out this possibility. On the other hand, this situation is currently hypothetical, and I think it is almost unwise to speculate on this situation.

Question: Mr. Secretary, can it be said that U.S. policy has not changed so far, and that if the Chinese Communist side makes some concessions, some major changes may be made?

Answer: Yes, I would say that. Our policies in these areas are flexible and adaptive to the situations we must deal with. If the situation we must deal with changes, our policies will also change accordingly.

### 美国制造“两个中国”阴谋又一供状——杜勒斯9月30日对记者发表谈话的摘要

    美国制造“两个中国”阴谋又一供状
    ——杜勒斯9月30日对记者发表谈话的摘要
    编者按：美国对中国的实力政策和战争边缘政策破产以后，美国迫于形势，改变对华政策。这一改变，在杜勒斯9月30日对记者发表的谈话里，就已经开始了。下面是我们从那次谈话中，摘录的杜勒斯谈到的几个有关问题。
    重弹“双方放弃武力”老调
    企图继续阻挠我国解放台湾
    问：国务卿先生，谈到政策问题，过去你曾经在许多场合谈到，如果中国共产党人愿意宣布在福摩萨地区放弃使用武力，那对谈判可能会有非常有益的影响。那末，照逻辑推下去，这是不是要我们自己也必须发表类似的声明，说明我们不会支持蒋介石政府对中国大陆采取的任何武装行动呢？
    答：我们显然认为，如果宣布放弃使用武力，那就应该是双方宣布放弃。我们不能希望有单方面的放弃使用武力。这应该以相互的原则作为基础和条件。
    问：国务卿先生，你在今天上午开始时曾两次说过美国政策并没有改变。可是在记者招待会的过程中你似乎至少澄清了两个主要问题，据我所知，国务院在以前并没有公开澄清这些问题，那就是：放弃使用武力的相互方面和这样一个事实：美国认为加强在沿海岛屿上的军事力量是愚蠢的，在某些情况下，他们应该撤退。如果这两点像它们看来的那样是重大的和重要的，为什么在以前不公开表明呢？
    答：哦，我们对于这两点中的任何一点的态度都不是新的。我认为，如果你——比方说——研究一下我们以前同中国共产党人进行的谈判的记录，你就会知道，我们认为：放弃使用武力应该是相互的，如果要宣布放弃使用武力的话；如果要求中国共产党人在受到中国国民党人的攻击时放弃使用武力，那显然是十分不实际的，而且是十分错误的。我可以说，在我们谈到放弃使用武力时，这一向是指除了自卫目的以外放弃使用武力。或许我以前没有表明这一点。因此，如果有人受到攻击，放弃使用武力这一点自然是不适用的。
    问：国务卿先生，你刚才说，宣布放弃使用武力，如果实现的话，应当是相互的。你是否会认为根据这个相互的协议，蒋介石会宣布不干预匈牙利式的叛乱，或者你是否会说一旦中国发生革命，宣布放弃使用武力的相互协议就会立即停止？
    答：啊，你知道，在匈牙利至少有一个时候曾经有一个政府要求外界给予援助，并且要求苏联撤退。如果有一个得到承认的中国政府要求援助的话，我不会认为那牵涉到对中国的武装干涉。
    再骂蒋介石在金马保持大量军队
    竭力推销所谓实现“停火”阴谋
    问：国务卿先生，几分钟以前你曾经谈到你在1954年12月同叶外长交换的信件。在那次交换信件的过程中双方一致同意，非经双方一致同意，不得把军事力量——这是两国的共同努力的产物——从条约地区移开。我们是否同意，像蒋总统昨天所说的那样加强沿海岛屿的防御工事和这些岛屿的力量？
    答：美国并不认为像中国政府希望的那样承担在这些地区大规模地使用武力的义务是正确的。但是鉴于中华民国态度很坚决，我们默然同意了这种意见。我们没有试图反对这种意见。结果是——我也许可以说——美国表示默然同意，但不是表示赞同。我们在进行过说服工作以后，也没有试图反对它。
    问：国务卿先生，由于你说你并不认为国民党中国人加强他们在金门和马祖的部队是正确的，我希望问你，你现在是否认为拟定使这些部队从这两个岛屿撤退的某种安排是正确的？
    答：这全要看他们是在什么情况下撤退而定。我认为，作为在攻击下的退却而撤退不是一个明智的步骤，因为这大概会对其他国家人民、其他国家而且事实上对福摩萨本身的民心产生影响。
    问：先生，你愿意谈谈你认为在什么样的情况下可以实现撤退吗？
    答：如果在那个地区有了看起来相当可靠的停火，我认为，在这些岛屿上保持这批为数不少的部队就是愚蠢的。我们以前就认为，把这些部队放在那里是相当愚蠢的，而且像我刚才所说的，如果有了停火，我们的判断，甚至是军事上的判断，就是，使这些部队继续驻扎在那里不是明智的，也不是谨慎的。
    问：国务卿先生，你似乎是强调需要有可靠的停火。你是不愿意接受共产党人的诺言的，你能不能对我们谈谈，你怎么能够同共产党人实现可靠的停火呢？
    答：这肯定是一个提得很好的问题，也是一个很难回答的问题。我认为，共产党人的诺言，仅仅因为是诺言，所以永远是不可靠的。只有当共产党人破坏这种诺言就会遇到不愉快的后果的时候，这种诺言才是可靠的。而且我认为，可以造成环境，来使共产党人觉得破坏这种诺言的后果是如此不愉快，以至我们可以假定他们大概会遵守他们的诺言，不是因为诺言的神圣性——他们是不相信诺言的神圣性的——而是出于权宜之计。
    问：国务卿先生，停火必须是书面的还是非书面的？它可以是仅仅由于停止射击、并没有任何书面东西而实现的事实上的停火吗？
    答：我认为，它可以是事实上的。
    问：国务卿先生，有一些参议员似乎认为，政府正在扩大同中华民国缔结的安全条约的地区，他们追述说，你曾在2月间在参议院外交委员会说，如果你有扩大这个地区的任何意图，你将再到参议院去。你认为对于我们在那里的活动所作的这种解释是否正确？
    答：不，我不认为是正确的。情况是，我们没有保卫沿海岛屿的任何法律义务。我们不想承担任何这种义务。今天，我们并没有这种义务。我们所采取的行动的根据是联合决议所授予的权力，这个决议同样也是国家的法律，这个决议说，如果总统认为保卫这些沿海岛屿对于保卫条约地区是必要的或者适当的，他就可以把美国部队用于这个目的。这就是人们对它的理解，这也就是我们所希望的。今天我要说，如果美国认为放弃这些岛屿不会对可能的保卫福摩萨和条约地区的工作产生任何不利的影响，我们就不会考虑在那里使用部队。正是由于在目前的条件下——主要是共产党所造成的条件——存在着这种关系，那里才有了这种联带的关系。
    有人说，这种行动的目的不仅是要把中国国民党人赶出金门和马祖，而且要把美国赶出福摩萨。当一个楔子的尖端，前面的尖端，打进来的时候，而且他们说，他们不会一遇到障碍就停止，而要一直打进去，那时你就必须判断，让楔子一股劲继续打进去，是会加强还是会削弱你所保证要保卫的那个地区的防务。这就是我们必须考虑的问题。
    问：国务卿先生，你刚才说，你认为可以创造环境来使共产党人如果破坏停火保证就会遇到不愉快的事情，你所指的是什么？你是说由盟国提出某种关于福摩萨本身的联合保证，还是别的东西？
    答：我所想的是除了美国之外或许还可以由其他国家实施的制裁。例如，可能进行贸易制裁等等。
    承认蒋介石反攻大陆是梦想
    但自己又做颠覆我政府迷梦
    问：国务卿先生：关于前面提到的放弃武力的问题，美国政府的态度是不是：美国希望国民党中国政府有朝一日会靠武力或者某种别的办法回到中国大陆上去，或者说支持这种想法？
    答：这是一个假设成分很大的问题。我想，这完全取决于大陆上发生什么事情。我认为，只靠他们自己的力量，他们是不会回到那里去的。如果大陆上发生某种动乱和叛乱，譬如说像匈牙利爆发的那种事件，那么，在几英里之外有一个拥有相当大力量的自由中国，就可能成为局势中的一个非常重要的因素。我想，我们大家都会觉得，如果匈牙利叛乱发生的时候，在离开匈牙利不到几英里的地方有一个自由匈牙利政府存在，局势的发展可能会同实际发生的情况有所不同。
    所以，我不愿意排除任何这样的可能性：在中国大陆或者中国大陆的一些地区发生某种也许会促使中国大陆或者中国大陆的那一地区同中国的自由政府，即现在福摩萨的中华民国实现某种重新统一的局势。我不排除这种可能性。
    问：这是要完全根据福摩萨政府的力量呢，还是美国作出了任何明确的和含蓄的保证，在你所叙述的那种情况中给予援助？
    答：没有，没有作出在这方面给予援助的任何保证。我想你们知道，在这方面的唯一保证就是在中国外交部长和我本人之间交换的信件中所包括的协议，这个协议说，除了在我们之间达成协议以外，不得从条约地区使用武力。因此，我们两国都不能随便从条约地区对大陆使用武力，除非——我想它是这样说的——发生了自卫的紧急需要。但是这种例外情况并不会包括你所谈到的那种情况。
    问：国务卿先生，如果在中国发生叛乱或暴乱，你是否预料它的领袖们会——如果他们愿意的话——交由蒋介石领导？
    答：我的确不认为这是一个我能很好地加以答复的问题。它完全——它取决于革命的性质。我认为它大概会主要是在地方的主持和地方的领导之下的革命。虽然可能寻求外界的合作和援助，至于是不是会要蒋介石回去作为政府的领袖，这是假设性的和无法预见的问题。我并不排斥这种可能性。另一方面，这个情况在目前是假设性的，我认为要对这种情况进行猜测差不多是不明智的。
    问：国务卿先生，是否可以这样说：美国政策到现在为止还没有改变，如果中国共产党方面作出某些让步，那就有可能作出一些重大的改变？
    答：是的，我要这样说。我们在这些方面的政策是灵活的，是适应于我们必须应付的局势的。如果我们必须应付的局势改变了，我们的政策也会随之改变。
