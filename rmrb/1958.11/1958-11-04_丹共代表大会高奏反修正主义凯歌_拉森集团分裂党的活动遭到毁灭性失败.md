Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 3rd: Copenhagen dispatch: The 20th Congress of the Danish Communist Party, lasting three days, concluded on the evening of the 2nd.

    The conference passed a resolution condemning revisionism and on the party's future tasks, and elected a new Central Committee that firmly stood on the Marxist-Leninist position. The newly elected Central Committee consisted of thirty-seven members, including eleven new members. In addition, twelve alternate Central Committee members and a five-member Supervisory Committee were elected. The new Central Committee did not include former party chairman Larsen and the very few other revisionists who followed him. Thus, the activities of the small number of revisionists headed by Larsen, who attempted to split the party, have suffered a devastating failure.

    After the congress, the newly elected Central Committee of the Danish Communist Party held its first plenary session, at which Knud Jespersen was unanimously elected Chairman of the Danish Communist Party.

    When the Central Committee's report was adopted, only twelve of the two hundred and seventeen delegates present at the congress voted against it, including former chairman Larsen. Throughout the discussion of the Central Committee's report, Larsen's revisionist views were strongly and resolutely refuted by the vast majority of delegates.

    Similarly, only those twelve people voted against the congress resolution.

    The resolution adopted by the congress resolutely condemned the revisionist program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The resolution stated: "Modern revisionism has emerged in recent years as an international trend, attempting to spread doubt and confusion among the working classes of various countries. Our party declares that it rejects the Yugoslav program, which was put forward to confront the Moscow Declaration and is incorrect and anti-Marxist on some fundamental points."

    The resolution pointed out that in our era, a transition from capitalism to socialism is underway. The hallmark of world development is primarily the competition between the two social systems of socialism and capitalism. The working class's struggle against the rule of monopoly capital plays a decisive role in Denmark's domestic development. If the struggle of the working class and the people is not led by a clear party that proceeds from the general laws of leading class struggle and building socialism, this struggle cannot be victorious. The resolution said that the Danish Communist Party must stand on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and be guided by these laws, in order to creatively apply the general principles of socialism according to Denmark's specific circumstances and conditions.

    The resolution pointed out that maintaining peace is the decisive prerequisite for guaranteeing the vital interests of mankind and the future of the Danish people. Therefore, the struggle to maintain peace is the party's most important task. The resolution said that the core of the peace movement must be international solidarity and the unity of the Communist Parties of all countries.

    The resolution also emphasized that the Danish Communist Party supports international solidarity with the Communist Parties of other countries, saying that this unity is the most important guarantee of Danish national independence. The resolution resolutely refuted all slanders that so-called internationalism would make the Danish Communist Party a "non-Danish or non-independent party." The resolution emphasized that the unity among the Communist Parties of various countries is based on common views and the common Marxist-Leninist theory. The party opposes all attempts to undermine the unity and strength of the world communist movement.

    Before the Central Committee's report was adopted, Danish Communist Party Central Secretary Thomsen made an important speech on several issues raised by some delegates in the discussion.

    At the meeting on the 2nd, representatives of many fraternal parties delivered congratulatory messages.

    The congress also passed (with one vote against) a "Letter to All Party Members," as well as a draft of the new party constitution and a political declaration.

    丹共代表大会高奏反修正主义凯歌
    拉森集团分裂党的活动遭到毁灭性失败
    新华社柏林3日电　哥本哈根消息：历时三天的丹麦共产党第二十次代表大会，已经在2日晚闭幕。
    会议通过了一项谴责修正主义和关于党的今后任务的决议，并选举了一个坚定地站在马克思列宁主义立场上的新的中央委员会。新选的中央委员会由三十七人组成。其中，有十一名新的委员。此外，还选出了十二名候补中央委员以及由五人组成的监察委员会。新的中央委员会没有党的前主席拉森和为数极少的追随他的其他修正主义者。至此，以拉森为首的少数修正主义分子企图分裂党的活动已遭到了毁灭性的失败。
    代表大会结束后，新选出来的丹共中央委员会举行了第一次全体会议，会上一致选举克努德·耶斯佩森为丹麦共产党主席。
    在通过中央委员会的报告时，在出席大会的二百一十七名代表中只有十二人投反对票，其中包括前主席拉森。在就中央委员会报告进行讨论的整个过程中，拉森的修正主义观点遭到了绝大多数代表的强有力的坚决驳斥。
    在表决大会决议时，也同样只有那十二个人投了反对票。
    大会所通过的决议，坚决斥责了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的修正主义纲领。决议说：“现代修正主义是在最近几年内作为一种国际潮流而出现的，它企图在各国工人阶级当中散布怀疑和混乱。我们的党表明，它摒弃南斯拉夫的纲领，这个纲领是为对抗莫斯科宣言而提出来的，它在一些根本点上是不正确的和反马克思主义的。”
    决议指出，在我们的时代中正在进行着从资本主义向社会主义的过渡。世界发展的标志首先是社会主义和资本主义两种社会体系之间的竞赛。工人阶级反对垄断资本统治的斗争对于丹麦国内的发展起着决定性的作用。如果工人阶级和人民的斗争不是由一个鲜明的、从领导阶级斗争和建设社会主义的普遍规律性出发的党来领导的话，这种斗争就不能取得胜利。决议说，丹麦共产党必须站在马克思列宁主义的基础上，并受这些规律性的指导，以便于根据丹麦的具体情况和条件来创造性地运用社会主义的一般原则。
    决议指出，维护和平是保障人类的切身利益和丹麦人民的未来的决定性的前提。因此，维护和平的斗争就是党的最重要的任务。决议说，保卫和平运动的核心必须是国际团结和各国共产党的团结一致。
    决议还强调指出，丹麦共产党拥护同其他各国共产党的国际团结，决议说，这种团结是丹麦民族独立的最重要的保证。决议坚决驳斥了一切所谓国际主义将使丹共成为“非丹麦的或不独立的党”的诬蔑。决议强调指出，各国共产党之间的团结是基于共同的观点和共同的马克思列宁主义理论的基础。党反对一切要破坏世界共产主义的团结和壮大的企图。
    在通过中央委员会报告之前，丹共中央书记托姆森就一些代表在讨论中提出的若干问题作了重要发言。
    在2日的会议上许多兄弟党的代表致了祝词。
    大会还通过了（一票反对）“告全体党员书”以及新的党章草案和一项政治宣言。
