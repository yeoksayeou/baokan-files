The textile mill releases colorful clouds, illuminating thousands of homes in the entire city, making the peacocks fold their screens, and the girls smile radiantly.

The colorful clouds rush to the sky, causing the Weaver Girl in heaven to feel uneasy. Hearing about the Great Leap Forward in the human world, could there be another new trick?

With gentle steps, she descends the steps, walks to the edge of the Milky Way, and quietly parts the clouds to look, both surprised and delighted.

The looms rumble non-stop, the red flags flutter incessantly, with ten thousand rays of colorful clouds and light, each layer is a new product.

Turning back to look at her loom, it is quiet, cold and slow. Even if she weaves a thousand kinds of brocade, how can it compare to the myriad spring scenes in the human world!

There is only one loom in heaven, but there are thousands of looms in the human world; there is only one Weaver Girl in heaven, but countless Weaver Girls in the human world.

The Weaver Girls in the human world are highly skilled, weaving fabrics more beautiful than flowers. The Weaver Girl in heaven has fallen behind and wants to beg for skills from the human world.

The Weaver Girl secretly ponders in the clouds, it's better to just return to her hometown, find her sisters in the textile mill, and release the colorful clouds in ten thousand zhang!

    天上织女回人间
    袁鹰纺织厂里放彩霞，照亮全城千万家，照得孔雀收了屏，照得姑娘笑开花。彩霞冲到云霄上，惹得织女心里慌，听说人间大跃进，莫非又有新花样？盈盈轻步下台阶，走到银河边上来，悄悄拨开云头看，又惊又喜满心怀。织机滚滚滚不歇，红旗飘飘飘不停，万道彩霞万道光，层层都是新产品。回头再把机杼看，清清冷冷慢吞吞，纵然织得千样锦，怎及人间万家春！天上机杼只一个，人间织机千万座；天上织女只一人，人间织女数不清。人间织女本领高，织出花布比花娇，天上织女落了后，要向人间去乞巧。织女云头暗思量，不如就此回家乡，纺织厂里找姊妹，再把彩霞放万丈！
