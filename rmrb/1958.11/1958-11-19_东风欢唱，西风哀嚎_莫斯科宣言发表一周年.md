    The East Wind Sings Joyfully, the West Wind Howls
    — The First Anniversary of the Moscow Declaration
    Jin Zhonghua

    From October to November, people's thoughts are constantly stirred by the surging historical torrent and the magnificent scenes before them. The People's Republic of China is nine years old, the great October Revolution is forty-one years old, and it has been a year since the Soviet artificial satellite, marking the beginning of mankind's conquest of the universe, went into space. Now, the publication of the two major revolutionary declarations of the Moscow Conference has also reached its first anniversary.

    Whenever there is a major turning point in history, advanced people, standing at the forefront of the times, issue calls to the broad masses of the people. Such historically significant documents become epoch-making milestones and guiding beacons in the progress of mankind. The "Communist Manifesto" of one hundred and ten years ago and the proclamations of the October Revolution forty-one years ago were both radiant and illuminated the path of human progress. The Moscow Declaration of a year ago is a historical document of equally great significance.

    The characteristic of the current era is that socialism has developed from one country, the Soviet Union, into a world system, including more than a dozen countries and nearly one billion people; the national independence movement is surging in Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world, expanding day by day; imperialism, especially American imperialism, is becoming increasingly isolated; and the forces of peace of the people of all countries are growing stronger. A year ago, representatives of sixty-four Communist and Workers' parties gathered in Moscow, marking the unprecedented unity of socialist countries and the world working class, and a new upsurge in the international communist movement. The two great revolutionary declarations announced to the people of the world that the world situation had changed, that the socialist forces were already greater than the imperialist forces, and that the forces of peace were able to restrain the blind recklessness of the forces of war.

    It was during those unforgettable days that Chairman Mao said in Moscow: "It is not the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind, but the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind." This meaningful Chinese saying vividly and powerfully depicted the world situation at the new historical turning point, and it immediately spread like lightning throughout the world.

    Another year has passed. Over the past year, history has progressed at an even faster pace. Everything has proven the direction pointed out in the two major Moscow declarations. Great leaps forward have appeared everywhere in socialist countries. The Soviet Union's third artificial satellite—as Comrade Khrushchev said, a large satellite a hundred times larger than the orange-sized American satellite—has been orbiting in outer space for more than half a year. It tells the people of the world with unparalleled truth that socialist Soviet Union has far surpassed the United States, which represents the declining and decaying capitalist world, in science and technology. The productive forces liberated by the 650 million Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party have created records of high yields of grain and cotton, and are also creating records of large-scale iron and steel smelting. Even people in the capitalist world cannot help but admit that this is a "miracle." We are accelerating the process of sending those outdated and backward laws that bourgeois experts have stubbornly clung to for hundreds of years to the museum of history.

    What about the United States? What about other capitalist countries? Over the past year, cold currents have been blowing, and they have all been shrouded in the threat of economic crisis. The United States, which claims to produce 120 million tons of steel annually, had a steel industry operating rate of less than half this summer, and an average operating rate of only about 70% this year; in Detroit, the "Motor City," one in eight workers is unemployed; according to official statistics, there are more than five million unemployed people in the United States. From one leaf, one knows autumn. Capitalism is suffering from hundreds of diseases, and inflation is taking away some of the meager savings of ordinary people. The epidemic of crisis is spreading. The British "Financial Times" said sadly: "British industry will face the most serious recession in twenty years this autumn." West Germany, which ranks third in the world in steel production, also fell to its lowest level since February 1956 last month.

    The East Wind blowing strongly, the West Wind bleak: this is the most authentic portrayal of world development over the past year.

    Over the past year, socialist countries have repeatedly taken major steps to ease tensions and strive for world peace. The Soviet Union took the initiative to announce a halt to nuclear testing, and the Chinese People's Volunteers completely withdrew from Korea and returned home. What about the imperialists? They admit that they are in a passive position, but continue to shamelessly act like rascals, struggling desperately. As pointed out in the "Peace Manifesto" of the sixty-four Communist and Workers' parties, the forces of peace can prevent war and maintain peace, but all people in the world must be reminded that the danger of war has not passed. The Moscow Declaration called on the people of the world to remain vigilant at all times and to wage unremitting struggles against the forces of war; at the same time, it sternly warned the imperialists that we advocate peaceful coexistence, but we are never afraid of war, and if the imperialists dare to recklessly provoke war, it will only accelerate their own demise.

    The development of international struggles over the past year has been very rich in content and has also provided people with profound lessons. The true face of the imperialists has been completely exposed before the people of the world. The people of all countries in the world have strengthened their unity and increased their confidence in the struggle. The United States imperialism secretly engaged in subversion in Indonesia, but it completely failed. The American and British imperialists, with the naked posture of pirates, invaded Lebanon and Jordan, threatening revolutionary Iraq, and as a result, were met with the angry opposition of the people of the world, and finally had to roll out of the Middle Eastern beaches in a sorry state. What was the result of the American aggressors stirring up trouble in the Taiwan Strait, and carrying out frenzied military provocations and threats of war against our people? Not only was it severely打击 by the Chinese people, but it has also fallen into unprecedented isolation throughout the world.

    Over the past year, the East Wind has blown fiercely, completely puncturing the paper tiger of American imperialism. It can no longer scare people, nor can it deceive people. People saw that when Nixon pretended to go to Latin America to peddle the outdated "dollar diplomacy," all he earned was a face full of spit and a body covered in rotten tomatoes and rotten egg juice. People also saw that Dulles hurriedly ran around like a stray dog, howling everywhere, and all he got was the curses of the whole world. The Associated Press commented on him: This is the most universally attacked Secretary of State in American history. People have also seen more clearly the ugly face of Eisenhower: this character who is accustomed to making empty threats and wielding a golf club as a big stick can no longer scare people, and even the votes he cheated from the American people are about to be lost.

    This is the most vivid change in the world situation over the past year. Chairman Mao said: Bad things can be turned into good things, and imperialism can act as a "negative teacher" to educate the people of the world. This is the result of the frantic struggle of the imperialists over the past year. In the midst of all these changes, there is also the Tito group in Yugoslavia, which has always hung the signboard of Marxism-Leninism, but has always helped the American imperialists from the sidelines. Now it has been exposed as a thorough revisionist. This has also given people a very important lesson!

    The general situation in the world today is that the East Wind is further prevailing over the West Wind. We see that the East Wind is singing joyfully, and the West Wind is howling. The people of the world are playing triumphant songs and moving forward. The imperialists, who have put their own necks in the noose, will not have a long life!

    东风欢唱，西风哀嚎
    ——莫斯科宣言发表一周年
    金仲华
    从10月到11月，人们的思潮不断地被汹涌前进的历史巨流和出现在眼前的壮阔景象所激动。人民新中国九周岁了，伟大的十月革命四十一周年了，标志着人类征服宇宙的开端的苏联人造卫星上天已有一年了。现在，莫斯科会议两大革命宣言的发表也已到一周年了。
    每当历史的重大转折点，先进的人们，站在时代的前面，向广大人民发出号召。这种具有历史意义的文件，就成了划时代的界石，人类前进中的指路碑。一百一十年前的“共产党宣言”，四十一年前十月革命的文告，都是光芒万丈，照亮了人类前进的道路。一年前的莫斯科宣言是有着同样重大意义的历史文件。
    当前时代的特征是：社会主义已从苏联一国发展成为一个世界体系，包括十几个国家和近十亿人民；民族独立运动在亚非和世界其他地区风起云涌，日益扩大；帝国主义特别是美帝国主义，越来越陷于孤立；世界各国人民保卫和平的力量，越来越发展壮大了。一年前，六十四个共产党、工人党代表云集莫斯科，标志着社会主义国家和世界工人阶级空前团结，国际共产主义运动的新的高涨。两个伟大的革命宣言，向世界人民昭告：世界形势变了，社会主义力量已经大过于帝国主义力量，和平力量已经能够制止战争势力的盲目蠢动了。
    就在那使人不能忘记的日子里，毛主席在莫斯科说：“现在不是西风压倒东风，而是东风压倒西风”。这句意味深长的中国语言，生动有力地刻划出新的历史转折点的世界形势，它立即像闪电一样传遍了全世界。
    又是一年过去了。一年来历史以更快的步子前进。一切都证明了莫斯科两大宣言中所指出的方向。社会主义国家到处出现了大跃进。苏联的第三个人造卫星——正像赫鲁晓夫同志所说的，比之美国的橘子一样的小卫星要大上一百倍的大卫星，遨游在宇宙太空也已经半年多了。它以无比的真实性告诉全世界人民，社会主义的苏联在科学技术方面，已经把代表没落腐朽的资本主义世界的美国远远抛在后面了。六亿五千万中国人民在共产党领导下所解放出来的生产力，已经创造了粮食、棉花高产的纪录，还正在创造大规模冶炼钢铁的纪录。连资本主义世界的人们都不能不承认这是“奇迹”。我们正在加速把资产阶级专家们死抱住了上百年的那些陈旧落后的规律送进历史博物馆去。
    美国呢？其他资本主义国家呢？一年来，寒流阵阵，它们都被罩在经济危机暗影的威胁下。号称年产一亿二千万吨钢的美国，今夏钢铁业的开工率不到一半，今年平均开工率也不过70％左右；在“汽车大王”的底特律城，八个工人中有一个失业；美国全国失业人数，照官方的统计也有五百多万人。一叶知秋，资本主义正在百病并发，通货膨胀在夺取普通人民一些仅有的余蓄。危机的流行病在蔓延。英国的“金融时报”悲哀地说：“英国工业将在今年秋季面临二十年来最严重的衰退。”占世界钢铁产量第三位的西德，在前月也已下降到1956年2月以来最低的水平了。
    东风劲吹，西风萧瑟：这是一年来世界发展的最真实的写照。
    一年来，社会主义国家一再主动地采取了重大步骤，来缓和紧张局势，争取世界和平。苏联主动地宣布停止核试验，中国人民志愿军全部从朝鲜撤退回国。帝国主义者怎么样呢？它们承认处于被动，但是继续在无耻撒赖，拼命挣扎。正如六十四个共产党、工人党代表会议的“和平宣言”中所指出的，和平力量能够阻止战争，维护和平，但是必须提醒世界的一切人们，战争的危险并没有过去。莫斯科宣言号召世界人民经常保持警惕，坚持不懈地对战争势力进行斗争；同时严厉警告帝国主义者，我们主张和平共处，但是决不害怕战争，如果帝国主义者敢于冒险挑起战争，那只会加速它本身的灭亡。
    一年来国际斗争的发展，有着非常丰富的内容，也给人们提供了深刻的教训。帝国主义者的嘴脸，在世界人民面前完全拆穿了。世界各国人民在斗争中加强了团结，提高了信心。美帝国主义对印度尼西亚暗中搞颠覆，结果完全失败了。美、英帝国主义者以赤裸裸的海盗的姿态，侵入黎巴嫩和约旦，威胁革命成功了的伊拉克，结果遭到了全世界人民的愤怒反对，最后不能不从中东海滩上狼狈地滚出去了。美国侵略者在台湾海峡兴风作浪，对我国人民进行疯狂的军事挑衅和战争威胁，结果又怎么样呢？它不仅遭到了中国人民的狠狠打击，而且在全世界也已陷于空前的孤立。
  　一年来东风猛吹，把美帝国主义这只纸老虎完全戳穿了。它再也吓不了人，也骗不了人了。人们看到，当尼克松装模作样，去拉丁美洲推销过了时的“金元外交”的时候，他赚回来的只是满脸的唾沫和一身的烂番茄和臭鸡蛋汁。人们也看到，杜勒斯急忙忙像丧家之犬那样东奔西走，到处嚎叫，他得到的也只是全世界的唾骂。美联社给他的评语说：这是美国有史以来遭到最普遍攻击的国务卿。人们也更加看清了艾森豪威尔的丑恶嘴脸：这个惯于虚声恫吓，拿着高尔夫球棒挥动当大棒的角色，不但再也吓唬不了人，连他从美国人民手中骗到的选票也快要输光了。
    这就是一年来世界局势最生动的变化。毛主席说：坏事可以变成好事，帝国主义可以充当“反面教员”来教育世界人民。一年来帝国主义者疯狂挣扎所产生的结果，就是这样。在这一切变化中间，还有一个南斯拉夫的铁托集团，一向挂着马克思列宁主义者的招牌，却老是从旁给美帝国主义帮腔，现在它已经被揭穿了，原来是彻头彻尾的修正主义者。这也给人们上了很重要的一课吧！
    当前世界的总形势是东风进一步压倒西风。我们看到，东风在欢唱，西风在哀嚎。全世界人民正在高奏凯歌，迈步前进。自己把脖子套在绞索中的帝国主义者，它的寿命不会太长了！
