State farms throughout the national agricultural reclamation system achieved unprecedented double harvests in land reclamation and agricultural production in 1958, with significant development in industry and sideline production.

	The total reclaimed area of the 1,400 state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms in the agricultural reclamation system this year is estimated to be between 18.28 million and 20 million mu, exceeding the reclaimed area in 1957 by 3.5 times.

	The total sown area of all farms this year is 19.46 million mu, and the total grain output will reach 4.71 billion jin, an increase of nearly threefold compared with 1957. The unit area yield of grain crops is 437 jin, an increase of 159% over last year; among them, the unit area yield of rice is 892 jin, an increase of 234% over last year; and potatoes 1,881 jin, an increase of 505%. According to incomplete statistics, more than a dozen farms, including Lutai in Hebei, Huangfan District in Henan, and Lianhu in Jiangsu, have an average yield of over 1,000 jin per mu for grain crops this year.

	This year, state farms have seen a number of large-scale high-yield satellites. The average yield of rice in state farms in Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi and other provinces and regions is over 1,000 jin per mu; the average yield of wheat in state farms in Qinghai, Gansu, and Beijing is 300 to 400 jin per mu. A mu of spring wheat satellite field in Qinghai's Saishike Farm averaged 8,585.4 jin per mu, setting the highest national record for wheat production. The average yield of potatoes (converted to grain) in state farms in Guangdong Province is 6,842 jin per mu.

	The soybean and cotton crops of various farms also achieved bumper harvests this year. The total soybean output this year is estimated to be 350 million jin, an increase of 1.5 times over last year, and the unit area yield increased by 1 times over last year. The total output of cotton in state farms this year is expected to increase to 1.6 million dan of ginned cotton, which is 3.6 times more than last year. This year, the unit area yield of cotton will jump to 121 jin of ginned cotton, an increase of 1.26 times over last year. Large-scale bumper harvests include 560,000 mu of cotton fields in state farms in Hubei Province, with an average yield of 150 jin of ginned cotton per mu; more than 10,000 mu of cotton fields in state farms in Henan Province, with an average yield of 194 jin of ginned cotton per mu, with 6,500 mu yielding 272 jin of ginned cotton per mu. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps has 100,000 mu of cotton fields with a yield of 150 jin of ginned cotton per mu, of which 1,150 mu yields 330 jin per mu.

	The development of livestock production in various state farms this year is also significant. The number of pigs at the end of 1958 is expected to reach 1,342,000, which is 355% of 1957. The number of cattle, dairy cows, horses, and sheep has also increased.

	In 1958, state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms engaged in far more industrial and mining sideline businesses than in previous years. In addition to processing agricultural and livestock products, they also vigorously engaged in iron smelting, steelmaking, and mining. According to incomplete statistics from the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, Hejiang Reclamation Bureau, Panjin Reclamation Bureau, Breeding Farm Administration, Liaoning, Guangxi, Guangdong, Yunnan, Shanghai and other units, the number of various industrial and mining sideline factories and mines is expected to reach 2,139 by the end of 1958, doubling the number of various industrial and mining sideline businesses established by these units last year. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, Mishan Reclamation Bureau, and Hejiang Reclamation Bureau have built a large number of factories and processing plants and mines this year, and it is expected that there will be 1,494 by the end of the year, which can smelt 50,000 to 100,000 tons of iron, 10,000 to 20,000 tons of steel, 500 tons of copper, mine 400,000 tons of coal, generate 1,000 kilowatts of hydroelectric power, produce 100,000 tons of native chemical fertilizers, 30,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer, 915 tons of bacterial fertilizer, and process beet sugar, flour, cottonseed oil, starch, milk powder, and wine.

	Under the impetus of the Great Leap Forward in production, the water conservancy construction of various agricultural and pastoral farms has also developed accordingly. According to statistics from 16 provinces (regions) and cities and reclamation areas, the irrigated area is expected to reach more than half of the existing cultivated land by the end of this year, with 156 new reservoirs and 707 weirs built. The largest water conservancy project is the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, which now has more than 3,000 kilometers of main, branch, and secondary canals. Last winter and this spring, ten large and small reservoirs were newly built, with 27 million cubic meters of earthwork, irrigating an area of 5 million mu. Water conservancy construction will continue this winter and next spring, further increasing the irrigated area by 8 million to 10 million mu. The Mishan Reclamation Bureau has completed nine reservoirs this year, with a total storage capacity of 330 million cubic meters, 75 main and branch canals, with a total length of 675 kilometers. The Hejiang Reclamation Bureau is building two large reservoirs, which will be completed and put into production next spring.

	Through the leap forward and further leap forward in the production of state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms throughout the year, greater accumulation has also been achieved. With the exception of a very few farms that suffered losses due to natural disasters, almost all state-owned farms are operating profitably. The situation of operating losses in state farms will end with the great leap forward in land reclamation and production this year. (Attached photos)

    国营农场开荒生产双丰收
    开荒总面积比去年增长三倍半
    粮食和棉花总产量增长三倍
    本报讯　全国农垦系统各场1958年开荒和农业生产获得了空前双丰收，工、副业生产的发展也很显著。
    今年农垦系统的一千四百个国营农牧场开荒面积预计为一千八百二十八万到二千万亩，超过1957年开荒面积三点五倍。
    今年各场总播种面积为一千九百四十六万亩，粮食总产量将达到四十七亿一千万斤，比1957年增长将近三倍。粮食作物单位面积产量为四百三十七斤，比去年增长159％；其中水稻单位面积产量为八百九十二斤，比去年增长234％；薯类一千八百八十一斤，增长505％。据不完全统计，今年粮食作物平均亩产千斤以上的有河北芦台、河南黄泛区、江苏练湖等十几个场。
    今年国营农场出现了不少大面积丰产和高产卫星。河北、河南、湖北、湖南、浙江、福建、广东、广西等省、区国营农场的水稻平均亩产千斤以上；青海、甘肃、北京国营农场的小麦平均亩产三百到四百斤。青海赛什克农场一亩多春小麦卫星田，平均亩产八千五百八十五点四斤，创全国小麦丰产最高纪录。广东省国营农场薯类平均亩产六千八百四十二斤（折粮）。
    各场的大豆、棉花今年也获得大丰收。今年大豆总产量预计为三亿五千万斤，比去年增长一倍半，单位面积产量比去年增长一倍。今年国营农场棉花的总产量预计将提高到一百六十万担皮棉，即比去年增长三点六倍。今年棉花的单位面积产量将跃为皮棉一百二十一斤，即比去年增长一点二六倍。大面积丰收的有湖北省国营农场棉田五十六万亩，平均亩产皮棉一百五十斤；河南省国营农场棉田一万多亩，平均亩产皮棉一百九十四斤，有六千五百亩亩产皮棉二百七十二斤。新疆生产建设兵团有十万亩棉田，亩产皮棉一百五十斤，其中一千一百五十亩亩产三百三十斤。
    各国营农场今年畜牧生产的发展也是很大的。1958年年终猪头数预计达到一百三十四万二千头，为1957年的355％。牛、奶牛、马、羊的头数也都有增长。
    1958年国营农牧场经营各种工矿副业比往年多了很多，除农畜产品加工外，还大搞炼铁、炼钢和开矿等。根据新疆生产建设兵团、合江农垦局、盘锦农垦局、种畜场管理局、辽宁、广西、广东、云南、上海等单位不完全统计，到1958年底各项工矿副业厂矿预计达到二千一百三十九个，比这些单位去年建立的各种工矿副业翻了一番。新疆生产建设兵团、密山农垦局和合江农垦局今年大量兴修工厂和加工生产厂矿，预计年底有一千四百九十四个，可以炼铁五万吨到十万吨，炼钢一万到二万吨，炼铜五百吨，采煤四十万吨，水力发电一千瓩，制土化肥十万吨，磷肥三万吨，细菌肥料九百一十五吨，和加工甜菜糖、面粉、棉籽油、淀粉、奶粉、酒等。
    在生产大跃进的推动下，各农牧场的水利建设也有相应的发展，根据十六个省（区）市、垦区的统计，今年年底预计灌溉面积可达到现有耕地的一半以上，新建水库一百五十六个，平塘七百零七个。水利工程规模最大的为新疆生产建设兵团，现已有总、干、支渠道达三千多公里，去冬今春新建了大小水库十座，土方达二千七百多万方，灌溉面积五百万亩。今冬明春将继续兴修水利，再增加灌溉面积八百到一千万亩。密山农垦局今年已建成九个水库，总库容量达三点三亿公方，干、支渠道七十五条，总长度达六百七十五公里。合江农垦局正在兴建大型水库两座，将于明春完工投入生产。
    通过全年国营农牧场生产跃进再跃进，也取得了较大的积累。全国除极个别农场因受自然灾害亏损外，几乎全部国营农场都经营有利。国营农场经营亏损的局面，将随今年开荒生产的大跃进而结束了。（附图片）
