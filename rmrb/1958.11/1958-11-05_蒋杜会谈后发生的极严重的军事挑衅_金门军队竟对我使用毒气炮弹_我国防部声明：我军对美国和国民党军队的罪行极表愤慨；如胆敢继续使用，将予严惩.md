Xinhua News Agency, 4th. On the afternoon of November 3rd, at 3:00 PM, during the artillery battle between the enemy and our side on the Fujian front, the Kinmen troops actually used poison gas shells to attack our army. It has been verified that the agent was a persistent poison, and fourteen of our soldiers were poisoned.

It must be pointed out that this new military provocation by the Kuomintang troops occurred after the Chiang-Dulles talks and the United States supplied the Kuomintang troops with a large amount of military materials. Therefore, this is an extremely serious event. The spokesperson of our Ministry of National Defense was ordered to solemnly declare: The Chinese People's Liberation Army expresses great indignation at this crime of the United States and Kuomintang troops. If the Kuomintang troops dare to continue firing poison gas shells, our army will inflict severe punishment.

    我国防部声明：我军对美国和国民党军队的罪行极表愤慨；如胆敢继续使用，将予严惩
    新华社4日讯　11月3日下午三时在福建前线敌我双方炮战中，金门军队竟然使用了毒气炮弹向我军攻击。据查明系持久性的毒剂，我军中毒十四人。
    必须指出，国民党军队这一新的军事挑衅，是在蒋杜会谈和美国把大量军火物资供给国民党军队以后发生的。因此，这是一次极其严重的事件。我国防部发言人奉命郑重声明：中国人民解放军对美国和国民党军队的这种罪行，表示极大的愤慨。如果国民党军队胆敢继续施放毒气炮弹，我军将给予严重的惩罚。
