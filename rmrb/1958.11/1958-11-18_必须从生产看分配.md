Distribution, in essence, is a matter of how to divide the products of labor. The critique of any distribution method should primarily rely on economic principles. Engels said: "Appeals to morality and justice do not help us forward scientifically in the slightest; however justifiable such moral indignation may be, economically it cannot be taken as proof of anything, but only as a symptom." (Quoted from Anti-Dühring, 1956 edition, p. 153).
	Distribution is about the allocation of the products of production. The most fundamental yardstick for measuring the rationality of a distribution method is to see whether it is beneficial to production and the development of productive forces.
	Recently, many articles have heatedly discussed various issues concerning the wage system and the supply system, but most of them talk about distribution in isolation, comparing the merits and demerits of the two distribution methods. However, distribution is about the allocation of the products of production, and thus, it is closely related to production. Engels pointed out: "The way in which products are distributed depends, however, firstly on the quantity of products to be distributed, and this, of course, varies with the character of the production and social organisation; and secondly it depends also on how production is organised" (Quoted from Anti-Dühring, p. 151). That is to say, the production method of common labor in primitive communes determined the equal distribution method of primitive communes, the production method of forced labor in slavery determined the unequal distribution method of slave ownership, the production method of serf labor in feudalism determined the unequal distribution method of feudal extra-economic exploitation, the production method of wage labor in capitalism determined the unequal distribution method of exploiting surplus value, the production method of common labor in the early stage of socialism determined the distribution method of remuneration according to labor without exploitation, and the production method of communism determined the truly equal distribution method of distribution according to need. Of course, the distribution method is not only passively determined by the production method and the exchange method, but also actively influences production and exchange in return. In short, distribution and production are closely related, and therefore, it is impossible to talk about distribution methods in isolation.
	The most fundamental yardstick for measuring the rationality of a distribution method is to see whether it is beneficial to production and the development of productive forces. Of course, the principles of equality and fair distribution are also yardsticks, but these yardsticks are governed by the principle of whether they are suitable for the development of productive forces. During the land reform in the old liberated areas ten years ago, there was agricultural socialist thought. Chairman Mao pointed out in his speech at the meeting of cadres in Jin Sui that "the nature of this thought is reactionary, backward, and regressive. We must criticize this thought." Agricultural socialism is superficially more "equal" than remuneration according to labor, but because it hinders the development of productive forces, it is reactionary.
	Under the leadership of the proletariat and guided by Marxism-Leninism, the transformation of the distribution method will not be blind, but will appropriately and better promote the development of productive forces.
	In the past, we did not criticize the bourgeois right form of remuneration according to labor because it only promoted and did not affect the development of social productive forces. It was a powerful weapon against exploitation and for transforming exploiters.
	The essence of remuneration according to labor is to treat labor as privately owned value, which can be exchanged for wages as remuneration. This is still treating individual labor as a commodity to be exchanged with society, and this is where the capitalist law of value comes into play. Because labor cannot be absolutely equal, and the specific living conditions of laborers cannot be absolutely equal, remuneration according to labor is superficially equal, but in reality, it is not equal. Therefore, Marx pointed out: "In principle, it is still bourgeois right."
	The nature of this "bourgeois right" of remuneration according to labor is objectively existing. Why didn't we criticize it earlier? Because this distribution method at that time only had the effect of promoting the development of social productive forces, and did not affect the development of socialist productive forces.
	When a society still has the ownership of the exploiting class, the biggest inequality and the biggest obstacle to the development of productive forces at this time is class exploitation, is getting something for nothing, not remuneration according to labor. On the contrary, remuneration according to labor at this time is a red flag, a weapon for the struggle against the exploiting class and for transforming exploiters.
	When a society still has a large number of unemployed people, it is necessary to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to work. The main inequality at this time is not remuneration according to labor, but that some people have no work and no pay. For example, in China from 1949 to the end of 1956, about 13 million people's unemployment problems were solved in seven years. This is a great contribution made by the Party and the government to the people of the whole country.
	Do not solidify the principle of remuneration according to labor, but gradually weaken it when conditions are ripe. However, it should be affirmed that remuneration according to labor is still the main measure for the distribution of products in the entire society.
	Only when all the people in the whole society become laborers, there are no people who exploit the labor of others, and there are no people who cannot work because they have no jobs, the productive forces are greatly developed, and people's ideological awareness is also greatly improved, the inequality caused by equivalent exchange based on the entire value measure of labor in equal labor becomes prominent. At the same time, due to the great leap forward in production, products are gradually enriched, especially the great leap forward in agricultural production. A large country with a population of more than 600 million can have an average of 1,000 jin of grain per person, which provides a material basis for changing the distribution method and implementing a partial semi-supply system that is not measured by labor but by needs. Therefore, in order to accelerate the pace of building socialism, it has become necessary and possible to implement partial reforms in the distribution system. For example, piece-rate wages that hinder the development of production have been abolished in some factories, and a grain supply system has been implemented in many rural areas. However, it should be understood that remuneration according to labor still plays a very important role in the current distribution system. It is still the main measure for the distribution of products in the entire society, and it will still play a positive role in a considerable period of socialist construction. If we do not gradually weaken its role based on the specific situation of the development of productive forces and the abundance of products, and the specific situation of the improvement of the masses' ideological awareness, but try to greatly weaken it immediately, or even abandon this principle immediately, it is obviously completely wrong. Because this will not only not promote the development of production, but will hinder the development of production. The reason why we want to point out that remuneration according to labor is a bourgeois right is also to make people understand that the highest principle we pursue in the distribution system is "distribution according to need" rather than "remuneration according to labor." Therefore, we cannot make "remuneration according to labor" sacred. Therefore, when conditions are ripe and in places where conditions are ripe, we must gradually restrict and weaken its role in order to gradually transition to "distribution according to need."
	From this, it can be seen that it is incorrect to criticize remuneration according to labor without considering whether it is beneficial to the development of productive forces. For example, to say that the remuneration according to labor in the socialist distribution method is capitalist exploitation and inequality, or even feudal hierarchy—extra-economic exploitation and inequality, would lead the truth to an absurd extreme. This inequality of remuneration according to labor is not only feared by the feudal class, but also by the bourgeoisie. It is the kind of "bourgeois right" that the bourgeoisie opposes. Only with the viewpoint of developing productive forces and the viewpoint of continuous revolution can we discover that it is the inequality within the working people of socialist society. This inequality should be eliminated, but it cannot be eliminated immediately, but only gradually eliminated. Because the main root cause of this inequality is that material production has not yet been enriched to the degree of "distribution according to need." In this case, if we want to forcibly eliminate this "inequality," we will inevitably commit the error of absolute equalitarianism. This is also not good for the development of production.
	The revolutionary spirit of the era of military communism should basically be attributed to the leadership of the Party and the awareness of revolutionaries. The supply system only plays some auxiliary roles.
	According to the view that the distribution method is closely related to the production method, and according to the view that the rationality of the distribution method should be measured by whether it is beneficial to production and the development of productive forces, the supply system issue is also relatively clear.
	The supply system of military communism played a significant role in the Chinese revolution. However, the supply system of military communism does not have a specific internal connection with social production. It can be implemented on any social production basis. The supply system of military communism implemented during China's new democratic revolution was built on the basis of the political and ideological leadership, organizational principles, and ideological awareness of the Chinese Communist Party. In order to lead the Chinese people to defeat imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capitalism, in order to liberate the semi-colonial and semi-feudal productive forces, and in order to complete China's new type of bourgeois democratic revolution, the Chinese Communist Party united the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, reduced material enjoyment to the lowest limit with a spirit of self-sacrifice, and did everything for the victory of the revolution. The revolutionary spirit of the era of military communism is indeed a red flag. Selfless work, self-sacrifice, hard struggle, mutual assistance and equality, etc., these should basically be attributed to the leadership of the Party and the awareness of revolutionaries. The supply system of military communism only has some auxiliary roles.
	The supply system of military communism and the supply system with the nature of distribution according to need currently implemented in rural areas have the same name, but are different in substance. Comrade Liu Shaoqi instructed during his inspection in Henan: The supply system currently implemented by many people's communes should be gradually increased. The current implementation of the supply system is different from the anti-Japanese war period. At that time, it was implemented when materials were scarce. Now it is implemented when materials are relatively abundant. There is a big difference. It is good to do half supply and half wages. Individuals should have some flexibility.
	The "big difference" mentioned by Comrade Shaoqi mainly refers to the difference in "materials" of the distribution objects. This essentially distinguishes these two supply systems by the relationship between the distribution method and the products of production.
	The supply system of military communism is not a natural product of social production, but only out of the need to defeat the enemy. Therefore, this equal distribution does not affect the development of social productive forces.
	The supply system of military communism implemented in the liberated areas during China's new democratic revolution was not a necessary product of social production, but out of the need to defeat the enemy. At that time, the new democratic production method in the rural areas of the old liberated areas could not produce the communist distribution method of distribution according to need. Because the supply system of military communism had no intrinsic connection with social production, this equal distribution did not directly affect the development of productive forces, but only guaranteed the material supply of the revolutionary team. At that time, the level of productive forces in the old liberated areas was basically low, coupled with the enemy's blockade and destruction, so materials were scarce. Even if it is said that productive forces have been developed to some extent, it is mainly the result of carrying out the new democratic social revolution and developing the large-scale production movement, not the result of the influence of the military communist distribution method.
	If we want to explore the distribution method issue in Chinese society from 1928 to 1949, not only is there no production basis for any communist distribution method in the Kuomintang-ruled areas and the Japanese-occupied areas, but also there is no production basis for any communist distribution method in the new and old liberated areas of the revolutionary base areas. At that time, outside the liberated areas, the distribution methods were adapted to the colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal production, such as land rent, high interest, low wages, and various extra-economic exploitations. Within the liberated areas, the distribution methods were adapted to the new democratic production, such as low rent, low interest, and increased wages.
	The partial supply system (semi-supply system) currently implemented by the communes is a distribution method that is related to the leap-forward development of socialist productive forces and gradually transitions to communism.
	Therefore, I believe that the distribution of the military communist supply system is not a necessary result of social production, and its implementation does not directly affect the development of social productive forces. The supply system currently implemented by the communes is the result of the development of socialist production, and at the same time, it will greatly affect the development of production. It is not a simple equal distribution, but a distribution method that is adapted to the socialist production method.
	The system of combining "partial supply" and "partial wages" is a distribution method that is adapted to the development of socialist production and productive forces.
	Of course, the revolutionary spirit of the military communist period and the supply system currently implemented by the communes have many things in common. For example, self-sacrifice and one for all, selfless work and unpaid labor, dedication to the revolution and breaking private ownership, equal distribution of daily necessities and equal distribution of the products of labor, and so on. This is the main reason why the supply system in this form has gained new content under new historical conditions. This supply system creatively solves the distribution form issue of the transition from socialism to communism. This is a new contribution to the Leninist issue of the transition from socialism to communism. The essence of this new contribution lies in: pointing out that the wage system of remuneration according to labor is a bourgeois right, but it is not to be abolished immediately, but to be gradually weakened; abandoning the supply system of military communism, absorbing its beneficial factors suitable for the development of socialist productive forces, and at the same time changing the shortcomings of the military communist supply system and the lack of intrinsic connection with social production, making the new supply system a distribution method that is adapted to the development of socialist production.
	Whether the military communist supply system in the old liberated areas should be changed to the socialist wage system of remuneration according to labor also depends on whether the change is more conducive to the development of production or not. At that time, in government agencies and some state-owned enterprises, there were still supply system treatment methods coexisting with the wage system. This method played a significant role during the revolutionary war period, but it was contradictory to the principle of remuneration according to labor and the economic accounting system, so it had to be changed. If we unilaterally emphasize the benefits of not changing today, it may not be suitable for the situation at that time.
	In short, gradually breaking the bourgeois right of remuneration according to labor is to gradually eliminate the inequality within the socialist working people. Implementing a partial supply system of distribution according to need is to gradually realize the true equality between laborers. Both of these are closely centered on the development of socialist productive forces. Changing the distribution method is to serve the development of production, and changing the relations of production between laborers (from unequal to equal) is also to serve the development of production. Viewing the change of distribution methods and relations of production from the perspective of the development of production methods and productive forces will be more suitable for the viewpoints of historical materialism and dialectics.

    必须从生产看分配
    方名
    按劳取酬问题是个分配方式问题。对于分配方式的批判，主要要采用经济规律的原则。恩格斯说：对于分配的不平等，采用“对于道德和正义的申诉，在科学上并没有丝毫令我们前进，无论道德上的义愤如何入情入理，经济科学总不能把它看作是证据，而只能看作是象征”（引自反杜林论1956年版153页）。
    分配就是对生产品的分配，衡量分配方式的合理与否，最根本的尺度是要看它是否有益于生产和生产力的发展
    近来许多文章热烈讨论了工资制和供给制的许多问题，但大都是就分配谈分配，比较两种分配方式的优劣。可是分配就是对生产品的分配，因而它和生产有密切联系。恩格斯指出：“生产品的分配方式和方法，同样取决于一定的社会的生产方式与方法、交换方式与方法，取决于这一社会的历史前提”（引自反杜林论151页）。那就是说，原始公社共同劳动的生产方式决定了原始公社平等的分配方式，奴隶制强制劳动的生产方式决定了奴隶占有制的不平等分配方式，封建制农奴劳动的生产方式决定了封建的超经济剥削的不平等分配方式，资本主义雇佣劳动的生产方式决定了剥削剩余价值的不平等的分配方式，社会主义初期的共同劳动的生产方式决定了没有剥削的按劳取酬的分配方式，共产主义的生产方式，决定着各取所需的真正平等的分配方式。当然，分配方式不只是消极地被生产方式和交换方式所决定，同时也反过来积极影响生产和交换。总之，分配和生产有着密切联系，因而不可悬空地就分配方式谈分配方式。
    衡量分配分式的合理与否，最根本的尺度是要看它是否有益于生产和生产力的发展。当然，平等原则，公平分配是一个尺度。但这个尺度受着是否适合生产力的发展的原则所支配。十年前老解放区土地改革过程中，曾经发生过农业社会主义思想，毛主席在晋绥干部会议的讲话中指出，“这种思想的性质是反动的，落后的，倒退的。我们必须批判这种思想”。农业社会主义在表面上比较按劳取酬还要“平等”，但由于它阻碍了生产力的发展，所以是反动的。
    分配方式的变革，在无产阶级领导之下用马克思列宁主义作指导思想的社会里，它不会是盲目的，而是恰当地更好地推动生产力的发展。
    过去我们所以不批判按劳取酬的资产阶级法权形式，是因为它只能促进并不影响社会生产力的发展，它是反对剥削改造剥削者的有力武器
    按劳取酬的本质是把劳动当成私人占有的价值，可以支出劳动换取工资作为酬劳。这还是把个人劳动作为商品向社会进行交换，这就是资本主义的价值法则在这儿起作用。由于劳动不可能绝对平等，劳动者的具体生活条件不可能绝对平等，因而按劳取酬，表面上平等，实际并不平等。所以，马克思指出：“在原则上仍然是资产阶级法权”。
    按劳取酬这种“资产阶级法权”的性质本来是客观存在的。为什么我们不早早加以批判呢？因为这种分配方式在当时只有促进社会生产力发展的作用，而没有影响社会主义生产力发展的作用。
    当一个社会还存在着剥削阶级的所有制的时候，这时最大的不平等、生产力发展的最大阻碍是阶级剥削，是不劳而获，而不是按劳取酬。刚好相反，按劳取酬这时是一面红旗，是对剥削阶级斗争和改造剥削者的武器。
    当一个社会还存在着较多的失业人口的时候，必须使人们都有劳动机会，这时的主要的不平等也还不是按劳取酬，而是有人无劳无酬。例如我国1949—1956年末，七年中间解决了大约一千三百万人的失业问题，这是党与政府对全国人民作出的伟大贡献。
    不要把按劳取酬的原则凝固化，要在条件成熟的时候逐步削弱它，但是，应该肯定，按劳取酬仍然是目前整个社会分配产品的主要尺度
    只有全社会的人都成了劳动者，剥削别人劳动的没有了，没有工作没法劳动的也没有了，生产力大大发展了，人们的思想觉悟也大大提高了，在平等劳动中基于全部用劳动作价值尺度进行等价交换所造成的不平等，就显得突出起来。同时，由于生产的大跃进，生产品逐渐丰富，特别是农业生产的大跃进，六亿多人口的大国可以平均每人有一千斤粮食，这又为改变分配方式，实行部分的不以劳动为尺度，而以需要为尺度的半供给制提供了物质基础。因而为了加快建设社会主义的步伐，在分配制度上实行部分的改革就成为必要的和可能的了，比如，在部分工厂取消了妨碍着生产发展的计件工资制，在不少农村，实行了粮食供给制等等。但是应该懂得，按劳取酬在目前的分配制度中还起着很重要的作用，它仍然是整个社会分配产品的主要尺度，而且，它在社会主义建设的一个相当时期内还会起积极作用，如果不根据生产力发展产品丰富的具体状况，不根据群众思想觉悟提高的具体状况，逐步削弱它的作用，而企图马上大大削弱，甚至立即抛弃这个原则，显然是完全错误的。因为，这样不但不会促进生产的发展，相反，还会阻碍生产的发展。我们所以要指出按劳取酬是资产阶级式的法权，其目的也是要人们懂得：我们在分配制度方面追求的最高原则，是“各取所需”而不是“按劳取酬”，因此，就不能把“按劳取酬”神圣化，因此，在条件成熟的时候和条件成熟的地方，就要逐步限制和削弱它的作用，以便逐步向“各取所需”过渡。
    由此可见，一切不从对生产力发展是否有利来批判按劳取酬是不正确的。例如，把社会主义分配方式的按劳取酬说成是资本主义剥削的不平等，甚至是封建等级制—超经济剥削的不平等，这就使真理走到荒谬绝伦方面去了。按劳取酬这种不平等，不但封建阶级害怕它，资产阶级也害怕它，它是资产阶级都反对的那种“资产阶级法权”。只有用发展生产力的观点，只有用不断革命的观点，才能发觉出它是社会主义社会劳动人民内部的不平等，这种不平等应该消除，但也不能马上消除，只能逐步消除。因为造成这种不平等的主要根源，是物质生产还没有丰富到“各取所需”的程度，在这种情况下，就想硬要消灭这种“不平等”，必然要犯绝对平均主义的错误。这对生产的发展同样是没有好处的。
    军事共产主义时代的革命精神，基本上应归功于党的领导和革命者的觉悟，供给制只有一些辅助作用
    根据分配方式和生产方式密切联系的观点，根据衡量分配方式的合理与否要用是否有益于生产和生产力的发展的观点，那么，供给制问题也比较明白了。
    军事共产主义的供给制在中国革命中曾经起过重大的作用，但是，军事共产主义的供给制和社会生产没有特定的内部联系，它是在任何社会生产基础上都可实行。中国新民主主义革命所实行的军事共产主义的供给制是建筑在中国共产党的政治思想领导、组织原则和革命者的思想觉悟的基础上。中国共产党为了领导中国人民战胜帝国主义、封建势力和官僚资本主义，为了解放半殖民地半封建的生产力，为了完成中国的新型的资产阶级民主革命，团结了中华民族的优秀儿女，用自我牺牲的精神，降低物质享受到了最低限度，一切为了革命胜利。军事共产主义时代的革命精神的确是一面红旗，忘我工作，自我牺牲，艰苦奋斗，互助平等，等等，这些基本上应归功于党的领导和革命者的觉悟，军事共产主义的供给制只有若干的辅助作用。
    军事共产主义的供给制，和目前农村实行的带有各取所需性质的供给制，名称虽然相同，实质却有不同。刘少奇同志在河南视察时指示道：目前许多人民公社实行的供给制要由低到高。现在实行供给制和抗日战争时期不一样，那时是在物资缺乏的时候实行的，现在是在物资比较丰富的时候实行的，有很大不同。一半供给，一半工资的做法是好的，个人应当有一些机动。
    少奇同志所说的“很大不同”主要是就分配对象的“物资”的区别而言的。这儿实质上是就分配方式和生产品的联系来区别这两种供给制的。
    军事共产主义的供给制并非社会生产的天然产物，只是出于战胜敌人的需要，因而这种平等分配并不影响社会生产力的发展
    中国新民主主义革命时期在解放区所实行的军事共产主义的供给制并不是社会生产的必然产物，而是出于战胜敌人的需要。当时老解放区农村中的新民主主义的生产方式，它不能产生共产主义各取所需的分配方式。由于军事共产主义的供给制分配方式和社会生产没有内在联系，因而这种平等分配并不直接影响生产力的发展，只是保证革命队伍的物质供给。当时老解放区生产力的水平基本是低的，加上敌人封锁破坏，所以物资缺乏。即令说生产力得到某些发展，那主要是因为进行新民主主义的社会革命和开展大生产运动的结果，并不是军事共产主义分配方式影响的结果。
    假如要探讨1928—1949年中国社会的分配方式问题，不仅在国民党统治区、日寇沦陷区谈不到任何产生共产主义分配方式的生产基础，就是在革命根据地的各新老解放区也没有任何产生共产主义分配方式的生产基础。当时在解放区之外是和殖民地、半殖民地、半封建的生产相适应的分配方式，例如地租、高利、低工资，以及各种超经济剥削。在解放区之内，是和新民主主义的生产相适应的分配方式，例如低租、低利、增长的工资等等。
    目前公社实行的部分供给制（半供给制），这是和社会主义生产力飞跃发展有联系的向共产主义逐渐过渡的分配方式。
    因此，我认为：军事共产主义供给制的分配，不是社会生产的必然结果，实行之后，也不直接影响社会生产力的发展；现在公社实行的供给制是社会主义生产发展的结果，同时又将大大影响生产的发展，它不是单纯的平等分配，而是和社会生产方式相适应的分配方式。
    “部分供给”“部分工资”相结合的制度，是适应社会主义生产和生产力发展的分配方式
    当然，军事共产主义时期的革命精神和现在公社实行的供给制有许多是相通的。例如，自我牺牲和一人为众人，忘我工作和无偿劳动，献身革命和破除私有，平等分配生活必需品和平等分配劳动果实的生产品，如此等等。这就是供给制这个形式在新的历史条件下获得新的内容的主要原因。这种供给制创造性地解决了向共产主义过渡的分配形式问题，这是对列宁主义的社会主义向共产主义过渡问题的新贡献。这种新贡献的精辟之点在于：指出了按劳取酬的工资制，是资产阶级式的法权，但并不是立即取消它而是逐步削弱它；扬弃了军事共产主义的供给制，吸收其适合社会主义生产力发展的有益因素，同时改变了军事共产主义供给制和社会生产没有内在联系的缺点，使新供给制成为和社会主义生产发展相适应的分配方式。
    老解放区这种军事共产主义的供给制应不应该改为按劳取酬的社会主义的工资制，这也要看改了于生产发展更有利还是不改于生产发展更有利。当时在政府机关和某些国营企业中，同工资制并存的还有供给制的待遇办法，这种办法在革命战争时期曾经起过重大的作用，但是它同按劳付酬原则和经济核算制是矛盾的，因而必须进行改变，今天如果片面强调不改的好处，未必适合当时的情况。
    总而言之，逐步破除按劳取酬的资产阶级法权是为了逐步消灭社会主义劳动人民内部的不平等；实行部分的各取所需的供给制，是为了逐步实现劳动者之间的真正平等。这二者都紧紧围绕发展社会主义生产力。改变分配方式是为发展生产服务，改变劳动者之间的生产关系（由不平等而平等）也是为发展生产服务。从生产方式、生产力的发展看分配方式和生产关系的改变，将更适合于历史唯物主义和辩证法的观点。
