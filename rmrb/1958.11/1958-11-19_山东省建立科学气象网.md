Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 17th - A meteorological science network has been formed throughout Shandong Province. Up to now, the province has built eleven meteorological observatories and one hundred and twenty-eight meteorological stations, achieving an observatory in each special district and city, a station in each county, two stations in some counties, and three stations in individual counties. At the same time, agricultural meteorological observation posts have been established in every commune, and all 64,830 production teams in the province have set up "weather watching" groups, forming a meteorological army of 284,250 people.
	Weather forecasts are generally transmitted using signal flags by the observatories, stations, posts, and groups everywhere. On average, there is more than one signal flag per square kilometer in the province, which can promptly transmit weather forecasts to every production team and every steel construction site, reaching every household and making them known to everyone. At present, more than 80% of the people in the province can understand weather forecast broadcasts, and more than 90% can recognize weather forecast signal flags.

    山东省建立科学气象网
    新华社济南17日电　气象科学网已在山东全境形成。到现在为止，全省已建起气象台十一个，气象站一百二十八个，达到专区、市有台，县县有站，部分县有两个站，个别县有三个站。同时，社社建立了农业气象观测哨，全省六万四千八百三十个生产队都设立了“观天”小组，组成了一支二十八万四千二百五十人的气象大军。
    各地台、站、哨、组普遍地用信号旗传递天气预报，全省平均每一平方公里多就有一面信号旗，能够及时地把天气预报传到每一个生产队和每一个钢铁工地，达到家喻户晓，人人皆知。目前，全省已有80％以上的人能够听懂天气预报广播，有90％以上的人能够识别天气预报信号旗。
