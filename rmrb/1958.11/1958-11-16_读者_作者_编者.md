    Recognizing the Relationship Between Labor and Rest
    The People's Daily on November 9th dedicated its front page to promoting the principle of "Good work leads to a good life, and a good life leads to better work." It vividly reported on the practices of counties like Liuyang in Hunan and Huangyuan in Qinghai in properly arranging farmers' labor and rest. It also published news that the Hebei Provincial Party Committee proposed to plant red flags everywhere in terms of caring for the masses' lives, and the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee proposed to ensure eight hours of sleep for the labor force. The editorial, "Attention Must Be Paid to Ensuring Farmers' Rest," theoretically clarified this issue. The editorial and reports gave us profound enlightenment and introduced valuable experiences. They also provided a strong rebuttal to the incorrect view that proper rest would delay production. This kind of reporting is welcome.

    Gratitude and Excitement
    I was working in the fields when I saw the People's Daily editorial "Good Food and Good Dishes." My heart was filled with gratitude and excitement. The Party, like a loving mother, cares for the people's lives meticulously, including our clothing, food, housing, and transportation, giving us warmth and strength. We must respond to the Party's concern with redoubled efforts.

    A Good Sketch Reflecting the Frontline Battle
    We are eager to understand the battles on the Fujian front, and we also yearn to see the noble spirit and heroic deeds of our soldiers through literary and artistic works reflecting frontline life. The supplement on November 8th published Comrade Liu Baiyu's sketch "Ten Thousand Cannons Shake Jinmen," which satisfied our demands. This article made people feel as if they were on the scene, experiencing the power of our army's artillery fire and the noble humanitarian spirit of our army. It also made us realize how closely related the front and the rear, combat and production, are. This is a good sketch.

    An Error in the Propaganda Poster
    The propaganda poster celebrating the October Revolution, published on the People's Daily, November 7th, page 8, is a good propaganda poster. However, there is an error in the Russian translation of "Long Live the Great October Socialist Revolution." The second word in the translation is printed as ЗДРАСТВУЕТЕ, it should be ЗДРАВСТВУЕТ.

    Introducing the Experience of Diversified Operations
    The People's Daily reports on the great leap forward in industry and agriculture are very prominent, and many readers at the county, district, and commune levels like to read them. However, there is not enough introduction of experience in diversified operations and mountain production. After the establishment of people's communes, we need to understand the experience of forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline business management even more. In addition, mountainous areas account for a large proportion of the country, and we hope to report on diversified operation methods in mountain production that are fast to produce and generate high income (such as oil tea, tung oil, tea, etc.).

    Easy-to-Understand Explanatory Articles
    We are studying Chairman Mao's thesis "Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers." Reading Sun Dingguo's article "Greatly Enhance the People's Morale, Greatly Diminish the Enemy's Prestige" in the People's Daily on November 8th, I felt it was very helpful. This article explained the thesis from a philosophical point of view and used current examples to illustrate the principles. For example, when discussing the universal significance and practical significance of strategically despising the enemy and tactically valuing the enemy, the article cited our efforts to eliminate the four pests, refine steel, counter the rightists, and capture scientific fortresses one by one, which was very clear and easy to understand.

    认清了劳动和休息的关系
    人民日报11月9日第一版集中宣传“劳动好了生活也好，生活好了劳动更好”的道理，对湖南浏阳、青海湟源等县妥善安排农民劳动和休息的作法，进行了生动的报道，还刊登了河北省委提出要在关心群众生活方面遍地插红旗、山西省委提出要保证劳动大军睡眠八小时的消息。社论“要注意保证农民的休息”，从理论上阐明了这个问题。社论和报道给我们深刻的启发，并且介绍了值得学习的经验，对那些以为适当休息会耽误生产的不正确看法，也作了有力的批驳。这类的报道是受人欢迎的。

    感激和兴奋
    我正在地里劳动，看到了人民日报社论“饭好菜也好”，内心充满感激和兴奋。党像慈母般亲切地无微不至地关心着人民的生活，包括我们的衣食住行，给我们温暖，也给我们力量。我们要以加倍的干劲来回答党的关怀。

    反映前线战斗的好速写
    我们迫切地希望了解福建前线的战斗，我们还渴望通过反映前线生活的文艺作品，一睹我军战士高尚的精神面貌和英勇事迹。副刊11月8日发表刘白羽同志所写的“万炮震金门”这篇速写，满足了我们的要求。这篇文章使人如身临其境地感到我军炮火的强大和我军高尚的人道主义精神，也使我们体会到前线和后方、战斗和生产是多么紧密的关联着。这是一篇好速写。

    宣传画中有一处错误
    人民日报11月7日第八版刊登的庆祝十月革命节的宣传画，是一张好宣传画。但是其中“伟大的十月社会主义革命万岁”的俄文译文中有错误。译文中第二个字印成ЗДРАСТВУЕТЕ，应该是ЗДРАВСТВУЕТ。

    介绍多种经营的经验
    人民日报报道工农业大跃进很突出，许多县、区、社基层读者都很喜欢看。但是对多种经营和山区生产等方面的经验介绍得还不多。建立人民公社后，关于林业、畜牧和副业经营管理的经验，更是我们需要了解的。另外全国山区占很大比重，希望报道山区生产中出产快、收入多（如油茶、桐、茶叶等）的多种经营方法。

    明白易懂的解说文章
    我们正学习毛主席论“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的文献。读到11月8日人民日报上孙定国写的“大长人民志气，大灭敌人威风”一文，觉得很有帮助。这篇文章从哲学的角度对文献作了解说，并且运用眼前的实例说明道理。比如在谈到战略上藐视敌人和战术上重视敌人的普遍意义和实践意义时，文章举出我们除四害、炼钢铁、反右派、攻取科学堡垒都是一个个着手解决，就很明白易懂。
