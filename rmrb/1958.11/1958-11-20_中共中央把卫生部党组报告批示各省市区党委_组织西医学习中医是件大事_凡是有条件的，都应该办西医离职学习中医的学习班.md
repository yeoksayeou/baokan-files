    Reported by our newspaper: The CPC Central Committee has issued instructions regarding the Ministry of Health Party Group's summary report on organizing off-the-job training classes for Western doctors to study Traditional Chinese Medicine, stating that this method of organizing Western doctors to study Chinese medicine is very good. Party committees of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, wherever conditions permit, should run such training classes.
    The Ministry of Health began to organize six key off-the-job training classes for Western doctors to study Traditional Chinese Medicine in December 1955. One of these classes, first established by the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, has already graduated in June of this year. The Western doctors who participated in this training class generally mastered a set of diagnostic and treatment rules of Traditional Chinese Medicine, including theory, methods, prescriptions, and medicines. They are basically able to use both Traditional Chinese and Western medical techniques for clinical practice, teaching, and research. The Ministry of Health Party Group's summary report was based on the teaching process and work experience of this training class (the report is on page six).
    The full text of the CPC Central Committee's instructions is as follows:
    CPC Central Committee's Instructions Regarding the Ministry of Health Party Group's Summary Report on Organizing Off-the-Job Training Classes for Western Doctors to Study Traditional Chinese Medicine: To the Shanghai Bureau, Party Committees of all Provinces, Municipalities, and Autonomous Regions:
    The opinions of the Ministry of Health Party Group regarding the experience of Western doctors studying Traditional Chinese Medicine off-the-job are very good. They are now forwarded to you. Please study and implement them.
    Chinese medicine is a summary of the experiences of our people in fighting diseases for thousands of years. It contains the rich experience and theoretical knowledge of the Chinese people in fighting diseases. It is a great treasure house that must be continuously explored and improved. We must organize forces to study, research, and整理 it seriously. According to the Central Committee's policy, the Ministry of Health has held a small number of off-the-job training classes for Western doctors to study Chinese medicine. Experience has proven that this method is very good. Party committees of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, wherever conditions permit, should run an off-the-job training class for Western doctors to study Traditional Chinese Medicine with seventy to eighty students, with a duration of two years. Students should have a university graduate level and two to three years of clinical experience, and preferably a Chinese language proficiency to read Chinese medicine books. In this way, by the winter of 1960 or the spring of 1961, the country could have about two thousand high-level doctors combining Chinese and Western medicine, among whom some brilliant theorists may emerge. This is a major event and should not be taken lightly. Please actively handle it.

    中共中央把卫生部党组报告批示各省市区党委
    组织西医学习中医是件大事
    凡是有条件的，都应该办西医离职学习中医的学习班
    本报讯　中共中央对卫生部党组关于组织西医离职学习中医班的总结报告作出批示，认为这种组织西医离职学习中国医药学的办法很好，各省、市、自治区党委，凡是有条件的，都应该办这种学习班。
    卫生部于1955年12月开始有重点地组织西医离职学习中医的六个学习班，其中由中医研究院首先创办的一个班，已经在今年6月间毕业。参加这个学习班的西医，一般都能掌握中医的理、法、方、药一套治病规律，基本上能运用中、西医两套技术进行临症、教学和研究工作。卫生部党组的总结报告就是根据这个学习班的教学过程和工作经验作出的（报告见第六版）。
    中共中央批示全文如下：
    中共中央对卫生部党组关于组织西医离职学习中医班总结报告的批示上海局、各省、市、自治区党委：
    中央卫生部党组关于西医离职学习中医的经验的意见很好。现在转发给你们。请你们研究执行。
    中国医药学是我国人民几千年来同疾病作斗争的经验总结。它包含着中国人民同疾病作斗争的丰富经验和理论知识，它是一个伟大的宝库，必须继续努力发掘，并加以提高。我们必须组织力量认真地学习、研究，加以整理。根据中央的方针，卫生部曾经举办了少数西医离职学习中国医药学的学习班，经验证明这种办法很好。各省、市、自治区党委，凡是有条件的，都应该办一个七十人到八十人的西医离职学习中医的学习班，以两年为期。学生的条件，应该有大学毕业水平和二三年的临床经验，最好能有看中医书籍的中文水平。这样，在1960年冬或1961年春，全国大约就可以有二千名中西结合的高级医生，其中可能出几个高明的理论家。这是一件大事，不可等闲视之。请你们积极办理。
