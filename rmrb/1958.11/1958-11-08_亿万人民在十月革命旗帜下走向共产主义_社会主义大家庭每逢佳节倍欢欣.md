    The meeting was attended by party and government leaders headed by Kim Il-sung, the Premier of the Cabinet of North Korea, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries to North Korea. Soviet Ambassador to North Korea, Puzanov, spoke at the meeting.
    Kim Chang-man, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, said at the conference that the declaration issued by the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries in Moscow last November demonstrated the unity of the socialist camp and played a significant role in strengthening the power of the socialist camp.

    When discussing the great historical significance of the October Revolution and the tremendous achievements made by the Soviet Union in politics, economy, and culture, Ton Duc Thang said that in order to commemorate the 41st anniversary of the Great October Revolution, the Vietnamese people should further strengthen their unity with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries led by the Soviet Union, and work hard to learn from the Soviet Union.

    Ulaanbaatar held a rally on the evening of the 6th, celebrating the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution. Luvsanravdan, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, spoke at the celebration. He said that in the forty-one years since the victory of the October Revolution, the international communist and workers' movement has continued to rise. The socialist camp is growing stronger and becoming a reliable guarantee of world peace.
    Soviet Ambassador to Mongolia, Molotov, then spoke. He talked about the great achievements the Soviet Union has made in various fields and the Soviet people's active labor in welcoming the 21st Congress of the CPSU.
    Mongolian party and government leaders Damba, Tsedenbal, Sambu, and others, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries to Mongolia, attended the celebration.
    German Democratic Republic
    Walter Ulbricht, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, said at a rally celebrating the 41st anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution on the 5th that developments in the international situation over the past year have proven that the analysis of the international situation made by the Moscow Conference of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries is correct. The forces of socialism and peace-loving forces are stronger than the forces of imperialism, and war can be stopped. Socialist countries will soon surpass capitalist countries in all aspects.
    In his speech, Ulbricht recalled last year's Moscow Conference and said that the common laws of socialist revolution and socialist construction put forward by the Moscow Conference have been further proven to be correct through a year of practice. He accused the League of Communists of Yugoslavia of opposing the Moscow Conference Declaration and undermining the unity of the socialist camp. He emphasized: "We are resolutely fighting against modern revisionism represented by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia."
    In his speech, Ulbricht emphasized the unity of the socialist camp and the importance of being led by the Soviet Union, pointing out that this unity of socialist countries guarantees the victory of the socialist camp in all aspects. He repeatedly mentioned the Soviet Union's assistance to the German Democratic Republic and expressed his gratitude for it.
    Ulbricht also talked about the great achievements made by the Soviet Union in various aspects of construction over the past year. He also talked about the construction achievements of other socialist countries and spent a considerable amount of time introducing the situation of the Great Leap Forward in Chinese industry and agriculture. When he talked about the situation of the Chinese people's commune movement, it aroused great interest among the attendees. Ulbricht said that the German people regard the achievements of the Chinese people as the achievements of the entire socialist camp, so the German people firmly support the Chinese people's just struggle against the armed provocations of US imperialism.
    The rally on the 5th was jointly organized by the SED Central Committee, the GDR Council of Ministers and the National Council of the National Front to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the Soviet October Socialist Revolution. More than 1,000 representatives from all walks of life in Greater Berlin attended the conference. Party and government leaders of the German Democratic Republic, Soviet Ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, Pervukhin, and envoys from various countries to the German Democratic Republic attended this grand rally.
    Czechoslovakia
    A grand mass rally was held in Prague on the afternoon of the 6th to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution.
    About 200,000 workers from various factories and other workplaces in Prague participated in the conference. Czechoslovak Communist Party and state leaders Novotny, Široký, and others also attended the conference.
    Prime Minister Široký spoke at the conference. When talking about the close connection between the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the Soviet Communist Party, he said, "We regard the Soviet Communist Party as an inexhaustible source of knowledge and experience." He also praised the great achievements of the Soviet Union in science and technology.
    Široký said that the proletarian internationalist ties between socialist countries have been greatly strengthened. "Hundreds of millions of working people in the socialist camp are united under the banner of Marxism-Leninism into a mighty torrent, and they are moving together towards socialism and communism."
    Poland
    On the evening of the 6th, people from all walks of life in Warsaw held a rally in the conference hall of the Palace of Culture and Science to solemnly celebrate the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution.

    When talking about Polish-Soviet friendship, he said that under the new historical conditions, the idea of Polish-Soviet friendship and cooperation has become the basic principle of our national policy. Those who attempt to undermine our friendship have suffered a shameful defeat.
    Zambrowski added that the basic principle of Poland's international relations policy is to strengthen the unity of the socialist countries' camp.
    Romania
    People from all walks of life in Bucharest held a conference at the National Opera House on the evening of the 6th to solemnly celebrate the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution.
    Romanian party and government leaders Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Chivu Stoica, and others attended the conference. Soviet Ambassador to Romania, Yepishev, and other foreign envoys to Romania were also invited to attend the conference.
    Maurer, Chairman of the Presidium of the Romanian Grand National Assembly, made a report at the conference. He said that the October Revolution opened a new era in human history of transition from capitalism to socialism. In these forty-one years, the Soviet Union has gone through a glorious road. Today, communism is no longer a distant prospect for the Soviet Union, but a specific task at hand.
    Bulgaria
    Tsola Dragoycheva, member of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and President of the Bulgarian-Soviet Friendship Association, said in a report at the celebration of the 41st anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution held in Sofia on the 6th that the forty-one years since the October Revolution have been a period of victory for the immortal Marxist-Leninist ideology. No force in the world can stop mankind's unstoppable transition from capitalism to socialism. All the fighting vanguards loyal to the working people in the world—the Marxist-Leninist parties—are the guarantee for the continued victory of the cause of the October Revolution and the cause of communism.
    When talking about the great significance of the conference of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries held in Moscow a year ago, Dragoycheva pointed out that in the year since the Moscow Conference, the ideological and organizational unity of the fraternal Communist Parties has been further strengthened. The vibrant socialist ideology is increasingly grasping the intellects of hundreds of millions of people in the world and becoming an invincible material force. Then Dragoycheva condemned modern revisionism represented by the Programme of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. She said that the treacherous role of revisionism and the essence of serving the interests of the bourgeoisie are particularly obvious and systematically reflected in the anti-Marxist-Leninist program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.
    The celebration was attended by Zhivkov, Yugov, Raiko Damyanov and other Bulgarian party and government leaders and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Bulgaria.
    Hungary
    The Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, and the National Council of the Patriotic People's Front jointly held an evening party on the 6th to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution.
    More than 1,000 people attended the evening party. Hungarian party and government leaders Kádár, Dobi, Münnich, and others, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries to Hungary, attended the evening party.
    Kish, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, spoke at the meeting.
    Kish said that now everyone can see very clearly that all the conspiracies of imperialism are doomed to failure, war is not inevitable, and world peace can be defended. (Attached picture)
