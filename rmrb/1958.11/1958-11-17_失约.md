Broken Appointment
Bi Dongzhao
Yongyao Electric Company, Ningbo, Zhejiang

    On the weekend, Xiao Zhang, a lineman from the power supply work zone, bought two theater tickets and excitedly called Xiao Fang from the cotton textile factory, inviting her to see the Yue Opera performance specially for workers at the Workers' Club tonight at six o'clock.

    In the afternoon, Xiao Zhang and his colleagues were to erect an 800-meter-long transmission line and install a transformer for the new steel factory to ensure that the steel factory's No. 1 blast furnace would be put into production tonight and the No. 4 blast furnace would begin construction.

    Under the command of foreman Jin Gen, everyone cooperated and worked hard. Immediately, three golden, shining copper wires were strung into the sky.

    By the time the entire installation was complete, and after the squad leader carefully checked and ordered the power to be switched on, it was already seven o'clock in the evening. Amidst the roaring of motors, Xiao Zhang suddenly pulled out the theater ticket and, looking at it in the light, exclaimed, "Oh no! The ticket clearly says the performance starts at 6:40. What am I going to do…?"

    Xiao Zhang didn't even bother to eat. He ran to meet Xiao Fang. Just as he rushed out of the factory gate, he bumped into a girl. He quickly took a closer look and said, "Hey! Why are you here too?"

    "Oh my, you clumsy oaf, you bumped me so hard!" Xiao Fang said hurriedly, pointing to a large group of people over there, "To support the steel marshal, our factory's Youth League branch mobilized everyone to come for voluntary labor. Knowing you were here, we specifically came to find you…".

    While Xiao Zhang and Xiao Fang were explaining the reason for the broken appointment, the cultural and educational committee member ran over and shouted, "Xiao Zhang, the trade union just contacted the club, and because you finished work late, they specially changed the date of the theater performance to tomorrow afternoon."

    失约
    浙江宁波永耀电力公司　毕东钊
    周末，供电工区的线路工人小张，买了两张戏票，喜冲冲地给棉纺织厂的小芳打了一个电话，约她今晚六点钟到工人俱乐部去看专门给工人演出的越剧。
    下午小张他们要为新建的钢铁厂架设一条八百公尺长的输电线路，安装变压器。以保证钢铁厂一号高炉今夜投入生产和四号高炉的动工兴建。
    大伙儿在领班金根师傅的指挥下，分工协作，猛干起来，立刻三根金光闪闪的紫铜线被架上了天空。
    等到整个安装工程全部完毕，经过班长仔细检查，命令合闸送电的时候，已经是晚上七点钟了。在一片??的马达吼叫声中，小张猛然摸出戏票借着灯光一瞧，“糟糕，票子上明明写着六点四十分开演，这如何是好……？”
    小张也顾不得吃饭了，就跑去会小芳。刚奔出厂门口，不料与一位姑娘撞了个满怀，他连忙定眼一瞧说：“咦！你怎么也到这儿来了？”
    “啊呀，你这个冒失鬼，把人家撞得好痛。”小芳一面急急地说，一面用手指了一下那边的一大队人马说：“为了支援钢铁元帅，咱厂团支部发动大家来义务劳动啦。知道你们也在这儿，特地赶来寻你……”。
    小张和小芳正在相互解释失约原因的时候，文教委员跑来喊道：“小张，刚才工会跟俱乐部联系了一下，因为你们工作做得晚了，特地把看戏日期改到明天下午。”
