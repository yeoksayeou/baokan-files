    Check for Full Seedling Emergence, Check for Blank Spaces, Check for Complacency
    Xiangyang Special District Combines Inspection with Rectification to Ensure Winter Planting Quality

    (Our report) After the basic completion of winter planting in various counties of Xiangyang Special District, Hubei Province, a mass movement to comprehensively inspect the quality of winter planting was immediately launched, checking for full seedling emergence, checking for blank spaces, checking for complacency and relaxation, and checking on the completion of the plan.

    The progress of winter planting in Xiangyang Special District was very fast, and the quality was better than last year, so some cadres believed that "this year's planting is good, there is no problem." In order to overcome this sense of complacency and relaxation, and to ensure the quality of sowing, the District Committee decided, after the end of winter planting, to adopt the method of combining inspection with rectification, and to rework and remedy all land that did not meet the quality requirements. Gu Cheng, Zao Yang, and Fang County organized winter planting inspection groups with thousands of county, township, and team cadres participating, divided into more than a thousand inspection teams to conduct inspections, appraisals, and acceptance. Problems were solved on the spot during the inspection. In Xinsheng Team of Changsheng People's Commune in Fang County, more than 300 mu of wheat only had more than 700 dan of base fertilizer applied per mu, and more than 140,000 dan of various fertilizers were still not delivered to the fields. After inspection, more than 200 people were organized to rush the delivery for three days, increasing the fertilizer application by more than 200 dan per mu. Before the end of winter planting, Yun County organized 300 acceptance teams, with a total of more than 1,100 county, commune, and brigade cadres participating in the acceptance. After a comprehensive inspection, it was discovered that there were more than 50,000 mu of land with problems such as low sowing quantity, failure to plant field edges and corners, rough sowing, and serious broken ridges and missing seedlings. The county organized more than 15,000 people to rework and replant all these lands. (Li Jinkai)

    查全苗　查空白地　查自满
    襄阳专区边检查边整风保证冬播质量
    本报讯　湖北省襄阳专区各县基本结束冬播以后，立即开展了一个查全苗、查空白地、查自满松劲、查完成规划情况的全面检查冬播质量的群众运动。
    襄阳专区冬播进度很快，质量也都比去年种的好，因而有些干部就认为“今年种的好，没有什么问题。”为了克服这种松劲自满情绪，保证播种质量，地委在冬播结束后，便决定采取边检查边整风的办法，把不合质量要求的地全部加以返工补救。谷城、枣阳、房县三个县组织了有几千名县、乡、队干部参加的冬播检查团，划分为一千多个检查组进行检查，鉴定验收。在检查中，发现问题，就地解决。房县长胜人民公社新生队三百多亩小麦，每亩只上底肥七百多担，家里还有十四万多担各种肥没送到地，检查后，组织了二百多人抢送了三天，使每亩增加施肥二百多担。郧县在冬播还没结束的时候，即组织了三百个验收组，参加验收的县、社和大队干部共一千一百多人。经过全面大检查，发现播种量少、田边地角未种到、播种粗糙以及严重断垄缺苗等，有五万多亩地情况后，全县组织了一万五千多人把这些地全部返工、补种了。　（李金锴）
