Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 16th: Sichuan Province convened a provincial-level Great Leap Forward conference on science and technology work from November 5th to 13th. Technical innovation experts and "native" experts from the industrial and agricultural fronts showed their skills at the meeting.

According to incomplete statistics, more than 210 technical innovation experts and "native" experts from industry and agriculture participated in this conference, accounting for about one-fifth of the total number of attendees. Their reports on various creations and inventions were extremely moving. Since the beginning of this year, Sichuan Province has had more than five million technical achievements in the industrial field alone. Most of the research results of important value were created by ordinary working people. Yang Changshi, a construction worker in Chongqing City, and some students jointly created an electric bricklaying machine that can lay more than 20,000 bricks per day, and the quality has also improved. Chen Xinzhi, an electrician on the Sichuan River, and others solved three key problems in the electrification of navigation marks and made automatic speed-regulating hydro-electric navigation marks, completing the electrification of the 18-kilometer navigation channel of the Sichuan River for the first time. Jiang Wanyong, an ordinary farmer who graduated from a primary school in Suining County, used grafting methods to grow cotton bolls on mulberry trees, and one tree yielded nearly half a kilogram of ginned cotton. Zhang Deyuan, a slaughterhouse worker in Chengdu, created a pigskin peeling machine that replaced manual operation. The time to peel a pigskin was reduced from fifteen minutes for two people to ten seconds for one person. He is also preparing to create an internal organ analysis machine.

The vast number of creations and inventions by the workers and peasants under the leadership of the Party greatly shocked many scientific workers and "foreign" experts. Many people consciously examined their various erroneous ideas, such as blindly believing in foreign countries, blindly believing in books, and thinking that the Party committees did not understand science and technology. They expressed that they should honestly learn from the technical innovation experts and "native" experts of the workers and peasants, combine with the workers and peasants, and strive to contribute to the technological revolution in the future.

After summarizing the basic experience gained by Sichuan Province in the Great Leap Forward in science and technology work, the conference discussed the direction for future development of science and technology work. Everyone unanimously agreed that it is necessary to resolutely implement the Party's leadership over science and technology work, proceed from promoting production development in scientific work, continue to eliminate various superstitions, liberate thinking, thoroughly smash the bourgeois expert line, vigorously carry out mass movements, achieve a combination of large and small, a combination of "native" and "foreign", and a combination of experts and the masses, and meet the needs of current production practice as much as possible; at the same time, it is also necessary to carry out some important and cutting-edge scientific and technological research work. The conference also discussed and formulated the Sichuan Province science and technology development plan, and proposed measures such as actively establishing a scientific research network throughout the province, improving research working conditions, and vigorously training scientific and technological cadres.

At the meeting, the Sichuan Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences announced its official establishment. The branch has established and is establishing sixteen research institutes, including mining, metallurgy, mechanical power, agricultural biology, hydraulic and electric power, petroleum, electronics, semiconductors, and traditional Chinese medicine. It will become the scientific research center of Sichuan Province. The conference also elected Ma Shitu, Huang Rongchang, and other 85 people as members of the first Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Association, and the Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Association was established.

    技术革新能手和土专家大显身手
    四川省总结科学技术工作大跃进的成就
    新华社成都16日电　四川省在11月5日到13日召开了全省科学技术工作跃进大会。来自工、农业战线上的技术革新能手和“土”专家在会上大显身手。
    据不完全统计，参加这次大会的工、农技术革新能手和“土”专家共有二百一十多人，占到会人数五分之一左右。他们在会上报告的各种创造发明，极为动人。今年以来，四川省仅工业方面的技术成果就有五百万件以上。大部分有重要价值的研究成果，都是普通劳动人民创造的。重庆市建筑工人杨长诗和一些学生共同创造成功电动砌砖机，每天能砌二万多块砖，质量还有提高。川江上的电工陈新之等解决了航标电气化中的三个关键问题，制成自动调速水力发电航标，第一次完成川江十八公里航道的标灯电气化。遂宁县初小毕业的普通农民蒋万用，用嫁接方法，使桑树上长出棉桃，一株树收了皮棉近一斤。成都市屠宰工人张德元创造的剥猪皮机，代替了手工操作。从两个人十五分钟剥一张猪皮，提高为一个人十多秒钟剥一张。他还准备创造一部内脏分析机。
    工、农群众在党的领导下浩如烟海的创造发明，使许多科学工作者和“洋”专家大为震动。不少人自觉地检查了迷信外国、迷信书本、认为党委不懂科学技术等种种错误思想。他们表示，在工农技术革新能手和“土”专家面前，自己要老老实实学习，与工、农结合，争取今后在技术革命中贡献力量。
    这次大会总结了四川省科学技术工作在大跃进以来取得的基本经验后，讨论了今后发展科学技术工作的方向。大家一致认为，必须坚决贯彻党对科学技术工作的领导，在科学工作中从促进生产发展出发，继续破除各种迷信，解放思想，彻底粉碎资产阶级的专家路线，大搞群众运动，作到大、小并举，“土”、“洋”并举，专家与群众结合，尽可能多地满足当前生产实践的需要；同时还要开展一些重要的、尖端的科学技术研究工作。大会还讨论制订了四川省科学事业发展规划，提出了积极在全省建立科学研究网、改进研究工作条件、大力培养科学技术干部等措施。
    会上，中国科学院四川分院宣布正式成立。这个分院已经建立和正在建立的有采矿、冶金、机械动力、农业生物、水工电力、石油、电子学、半导体、中医中药等十六个研究所。它将成为四川省的科学研究中心。大会还选举了马识途、黄荣昌等八十五人为四川省第一届科学技术协会委员，成立了四川省科学技术协会。
