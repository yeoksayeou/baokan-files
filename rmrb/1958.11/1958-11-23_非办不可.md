    Must Be Done
    Huang Peiran, Deputy Director of Shangzhuang People's Commune
    Two months ago, looking south from our commune's location, Shangzhuang, was still a field of green radishes. Now, a comprehensive chemical plant has been erected.
    The reason we are building a chemical plant while vigorously developing steel and rushing to harvest and plant autumn crops is not because we had the idea of developing the chemical industry early on. In fact, we were initially unfamiliar with it. It was said that chemistry was all about formulas, foreign words, and so on. Not to mention going to the factory ourselves, just mentioning the word "chemistry" was a bit scary. We thought it was something for big experts and intellectuals to do. People without specialized knowledge might cause some danger if they run a chemical plant.
    However, the objective situation forces us to develop the chemical industry.
    First of all, we still don't have a fundamental solution to eliminating pests and diseases. In the past, when pests occurred, we would ask the county for pesticides. If we couldn't get enough, we had to use manual methods, which cost a lot of labor. Our commune has many things to do, and labor is very tight. Therefore, we must find a way to produce pesticides ourselves. Secondly, to further increase the yield per unit area of ​​grain, relying solely on farm manure is not enough. If we can produce chemical fertilizers and plant stimulants ourselves, we can not only meet our large needs for fertilizers, but also save a lot of labor for accumulating, transporting, and applying fertilizers, which is a win-win situation. Thirdly, our commune has had an unprecedented bumper harvest this year, especially the sweet potato yield has increased even more. With a population of more than 56,000, each person can average more than 8,000 catties. So many sweet potatoes can't be eaten no matter what. In the past, our grain was always relatively tight, so we were of course very happy about the bumper grain harvest, but we didn't consider the problem of what to do with the surplus grain. On August 4th, Chairman Mao came to Xushui and raised the question of what to do with the increased grain, which aroused our attention. At first, everyone was worried about the excessive increase in sweet potato production. Later, we were overjoyed to hear that the chemical industry could process a large number of sweet potatoes.
    Just at this time, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Provincial Department of Chemical Industry, and the Xushui County Committee of the Communist Party of China organized a working group to assist us in developing the chemical industry with indigenous methods. The party and government leaders of our commune immediately decided to draw out a strong team to vigorously build a chemical plant, and repeatedly explained the relationship between chemical industry and agricultural production and the lives of the people in the commune at cadre meetings and mass meetings. Cadres and the masses all said that they must make a big effort. Everyone is most interested in rubber products, because rubber tires are a big problem in our commune. Most of the large carts we currently have are iron-wheeled carts. Iron-wheeled carts carry less weight, have low transportation efficiency, and easily damage roads. People urgently need rubber tires.
    After more than two months of hard work, our commune's chemical plant is now taking shape. The people of the entire commune love this factory and are determined to build and manage it well. (Attached photo)

    非办不可
    商庄人民公社副社长　黄沛然
    在两个月以前，从我们的社址——商庄向南看去，还是一片绿油油的萝卜地，现在已竖起一座综合性的化工厂。
    我们所以在大搞钢铁和突击秋收秋种的同时搞化工厂，倒不是因为我们早就有办化学工业的想法。其实，最初我们对它是陌生的，据说化学尽是什么分子式、外国字等等，不用说亲自去搞工厂，提到“化学”二字都有点吓人呢，认为这是大专家、大知识分子做的事，没有专门知识的人搞化工厂，不一定会出什么危险呢。
    但是，客观形势迫使我们非去办化学工业不可。
    首先，我们现在对消灭病虫害还没有根本办法。过去发生虫害时，就向县里要农药；不能得到满足，就只好用人工捕打，花费很多劳动力。我们社要办的事很多，劳动力很紧张，因此，必须自己设法生产农药。其次，要进一步提高粮食的单位面积产量，光依靠农家肥料也是不够的。如果能够自己生产化学肥料和植物刺激素，那么，不但可以满足我们对于肥料的大量需要，而且可以节省出积肥、送肥和施肥的大量劳动力，正是一举两得。第三，今年我们社的庄稼空前大丰收，尤其是红薯的产量增加更多，全社五万六千多人，每人平均可达八千多斤。这么多的红薯，是无论如何也吃不完的。过去我们粮食总是比较紧张，对于粮食丰收当然非常高兴，但对多余粮食的出路问题却没有考虑到。8月4日毛主席来到徐水，给大家提出粮食多了怎么办的问题，这才引起我们的重视。开始大家为红薯的增产过猛而发愁，以后听说办化学工业可以处理大量的红薯，不禁喜出望外。
    正好在这时，化学工业部、省化工局和中共徐水县委组织了工作组到我社协助我们用土办法来搞化学工业。我们社的党政领导立即决定抽出强有力的队伍来大办化工厂，在干部会议和群众大会上，反复说明搞化学工业对农业生产及全社人民生活的关系。干部和群众都表示，一定要大搞一场。大家对橡胶制品最感兴趣，因为橡胶轮胎是我们社里的大问题。我们社现仅有的大车大部分都是铁轮车。铁轮车载重少，运输效率低，还容易压坏道路。人们迫切需要橡胶轮胎。
    经过两个多月的苦战，现在我们公社的化工厂已初具规模了。全社人民都热爱这个工厂，都下决心一定要把这个厂建好，管好。（附图片）
