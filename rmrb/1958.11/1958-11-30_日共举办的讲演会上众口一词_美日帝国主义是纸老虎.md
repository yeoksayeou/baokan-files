Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 27th: The Central Committee and the Tokyo Metropolitan Committee of the Japanese Communist Party jointly held a lecture on the "Japan-U.S. Security Treaty Issue" in Tokyo on the 24th and 25th. One hundred and fifty Japanese Communist Party members and trade union activists participated in the lecture.

Toki Tsuyoshi, an alternate member of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, and others delivered detailed lectures on the essence of the negotiations between Japan and the United States regarding the revision of the "Security Treaty," the conspiracies contained in these negotiations, and how to launch a struggle to abolish the treaty. The participants also held enthusiastic discussions.

Speakers at the meeting pointed out that the American and Japanese reactionaries are vigorously promoting the idea of revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" into an equal treaty, which is completely deceptive. To establish truly equal relations between Japan and the United States, the U.S. military must first withdraw from Japan.

The speakers thoroughly exposed the conspiracy of American and Japanese imperialism to launch aggression jointly in Asia. However, they emphasized that American and Japanese imperialism appear powerful, but they are actually just two paper tigers.

After enthusiastic discussion, all participants unanimously agreed that, after the Kishi Nobusuke group was forced to temporarily shelve the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment," it is necessary to deepen the understanding of the dangers contained in the Japan-U.S. negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty" among the broad masses of the Japanese people. They also expressed their determination to work hard for this purpose.

    日共举办的讲演会上众口一词
    美日帝国主义是纸老虎
    据新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会和东京都委员会24日和25日在东京联合举行关于“日美安全条约问题”的讲演会。日本共产党党员和工会积极分子一百五十人参加了讲演会。
    日本共产党中央委员会候补委员土岐强等在会上就日美关于修改“安全条约”的谈判的本质和这次谈判包藏的阴谋、怎样展开废除这项条约的斗争等问题发表了详尽的讲演，与会者还进行了热烈的讨论。
    在会上发表讲演的人指出，美日反动派正在极力宣传要把日美“安全条约”修改为平等的条约，这完全是欺骗。要在日美两国间建立真正平等的关系，只有先使美军从日本撤出。
    讲演者彻底揭穿了美日帝国主义梦想联合在亚洲发动侵略的阴谋。但是，他们强调指出，美日帝国主义貌似强大，其实不过是两只纸老虎。
    全体与会者经过热烈讨论后一致认为，在岸信介集团被迫暂时搁置“警察官职务执行法修正案”以后，要使日本广大人民加深认识日美关于修改“安全条约”的谈判所包含的危险。他们同时表示要坚决为此而努力。
