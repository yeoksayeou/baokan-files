Xinhua News Agency, 9th November: Korean Ambassador to China, Li Yonghao, held a reception in Beijing this evening to welcome the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation, led by Commander Yang Yong and Political Commissar Wang Ping. The hosts and guests repeatedly and warmly congratulated each other at the banquet, wishing that the China-North Korea friendship, cemented with blood, would blossom everywhere and shine forever.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and Chairman of the China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, Guo Moruo, proposed toasts at the banquet, expressing their heartfelt regards to the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic's government, and the entire Korean people, led by Premier Kim Il-sung. They thanked the heroic Korean people for their tremendous internationalist assistance to the Chinese people and for their kind guidance and care for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

The banquet was filled with a friendly and joyful atmosphere from beginning to end. Also present at the banquet were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan, Vice Mayors of Beijing Wan Li and Wu Han, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Yang Chengwu, Air Force General Liu Yalou, General Li Jukui, Vice Chairman of the China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Beijing Branch of the China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea Zhang Xiruo, and Vice President of the China-Korea Friendship Association Lao She, among others.

Ambassador Li Yonghao delivered a speech at the beginning of the banquet. He said that when the people of our country were in the most difficult period due to the aggression of American imperialism, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, together with the Korean People's Army, carried out a heroic struggle and achieved victory. After the armistice, the Volunteer Army actively helped the people of our country in their reconstruction work with their own labor. Our people infinitely respect and love you from the bottom of our hearts, and we will further consolidate the friendship and unity between the people of North Korea and China so that this friendship will develop and blossom everywhere.

Ambassador Li Yonghao also said enthusiastically that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is the closest friend of the Korean people and the most beloved people of the Chinese people. Through your activities, you will shine forever as a symbol of North Korea-China friendship.

Ambassador Li Yonghao said that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's voluntary withdrawal from North Korea put American imperialism in a passive and chaotic position, creating favorable conditions for a peaceful solution to the Korean problem. Ambassador Li Yonghao continued that today, American imperialism has forgotten the bitter lessons of the Korean War and continues to carry out aggressive activities against the people of North Korea and China in South Korea and China's Taiwan. American imperialism attempts to turn South Korea into its colony and atomic war base, and is now playing the trick of creating "two Chinas" in an attempt to permanently occupy Taiwan.

Ambassador Li Yonghao emphasized that if American imperialism brazenly disregards the unanimous opposition of the people of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union and the people of the world, and dares to continue its aggressive activities against the people of North Korea and China, then without a doubt, it will suffer an even more tragic defeat.

Commander Yang Yong, filled with friendly passion, extended the warmest and best wishes to the fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters of North Korea. Yang Yong said that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army lived with the heroic Korean people in North Korea for eight years. During this period, the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic's government, and the Korean people, led by Premier Kim Il-sung, gave us meticulous care and assistance, making us feel as close as a family, whether during wartime or after the armistice. During our withdrawal, we were also given a grand farewell by the entire Korean people. This is the most precious friendship of the Korean people towards the Chinese people. This friendship will forever be remembered in our hearts and will always be a source of strength to encourage us to move forward.

Yang Yong said that after the Volunteer Army returned to the motherland, it reported to the people of our motherland and conveyed the deep friendship of the Korean people towards the Chinese people. The people of our motherland, with immense gratitude and admiration, expressed their gratitude to the heroic Korean people, and cherished and cherished this mountain-high and sea-deep friendship cemented by the blood of our two peoples. When the people of our motherland heard about the great achievements made by the Korean people in building socialism, especially the scene of leaping forward at full speed towards socialism on the Chollima since this year, they were as happy as if their own motherland had achieved achievements.

Commander Yang Yong finally said that although our Volunteer Army has left North Korea, we are still concerned about the socialist construction of the Korean people, just as we were in North Korea, and we care about the fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters of North Korea with whom we have spent eight years. We sincerely wish the fraternal Korean people greater achievements in socialist construction; we believe that the heroic Korean people will surely achieve victory in the struggle to unify their own country.

    李永镐大使设宴招待志愿军代表团
    愿朝中友谊永放光彩
    周总理陈毅副总理郭沫若主席感谢朝鲜人民对志愿军的关怀
    新华社9日讯　朝鲜驻中国大使李永镐今天晚间在北京举行宴会，招待以杨勇司令员和王平政治委员为首的中国人民志愿军代表团。宾主们在宴会上互相一再热烈祝贺，祝愿用鲜血凝结成的山高海深的中朝友谊遍地开花，永放光彩。
    周恩来总理、陈毅副总理和中国人民抗美援朝总会主席郭沫若在宴会上祝酒时，他们衷心地向以金日成首相为首的朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民致意，感谢英雄的朝鲜人民对中国人民的国际主义的巨大帮助，感谢他们对中国人民志愿军的亲切教导和关怀。
    宴会自始至终充满了友好和欢乐的气氛。出席宴会的还有外交部副部长曾涌泉，北京市副市长万里、吴晗，中国人民解放军高级将领杨成武上将、刘亚楼空军上将、李聚奎上将、中国人民抗美援朝总会副主席廖承志，北京市抗美援朝分会主席张奚若和中国朝鲜友好协会副会长老舍等。
    李永镐大使在宴会开始时首先致词。他说，当我国人民由于美帝国主义的侵略而处在最艰苦的时期，中国人民志愿军同朝鲜人民军一道，进行了英勇的斗争，取得了胜利。停战以后，志愿军又用自己的劳动，积极帮助了我国人民的恢复建设工作。我国人民从心坎里无限尊敬和热爱你们，并且还要进一步巩固朝中两国人民的友谊和团结，使这种友谊日益发展，遍地开花。
    李永镐大使还热情地说，中国人民志愿军是朝鲜人民最亲密的朋友，是中国人民最可爱的人。通过你们的活动，你们将作为朝中友谊的象征而永放光彩。
    李永镐大使说，中国人民志愿军主动撤出朝鲜，使得美帝国主义处于被动、陷于混乱，为和平解决朝鲜问题创造了有利的条件。李永镐大使继续说，今天，美帝国主义竟然忘了在朝鲜战争中的惨败教训，继续在朝鲜南部和中国的台湾进行反对朝中人民的侵略活动。美帝国主义企图把南朝鲜变成它的殖民地和原子战争基地，现在又玩弄制造“两个中国”的阴谋，企图永远霸占台湾。
    李永镐大使强调说，如果美帝国主义悍然不顾以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民和全世界人民的一致反对，胆敢继续它的反对朝中人民的侵略活动，那末毫无疑问，它一定会遭到更加悲惨的失败。
    杨勇司令员满怀友谊的激情，向朝鲜的父老兄弟姊妹们致以最热烈最美好的祝愿。杨勇说，中国人民志愿军在朝鲜，和英雄的朝鲜人民一起生活了八年。在这期间，以金日成首相为首的朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和朝鲜人民给予了我们无微不至的关怀和帮助，无论战时或停战以后，使我们都感到像一家人一样地亲切。在我们撤军期间，又受到了朝鲜人民全民性的隆重的欢送。这是朝鲜人民对中国人民的最珍贵的友谊。这种友谊将永远记忆在我们的心间，永远是鼓舞我们前进的力量的源泉。
    杨勇说，志愿军回到祖国以后，向我们祖国人民作了汇报，转达了朝鲜人民对中国人民的深情厚谊。我们祖国人民，都怀着万分感激和敬佩的心情，向英雄的朝鲜人民表示感谢，并且十分珍视和爱护我们两国人民用鲜血凝成的这种山高海深般的友谊。当我们祖国人民在听到我们传达朝鲜人民在建设社会主义中获得的巨大成就，特别是今年以来，跨上千里马向社会主义飞快跃进的情景，都像我们自己祖国获得成就一样高兴。
    杨勇司令员最后说，我们志愿军虽然已经离开了朝鲜，但是，我们仍然像在朝鲜一样，关心着朝鲜人民社会主义建设，关心着我们相处过八年的朝鲜父老兄弟姊妹们。我们衷心地预祝兄弟般的朝鲜人民，在社会主义建设中获得更大的成就；我们相信，英雄的朝鲜人民，在统一自己祖国的斗争中，一定会取得胜利。（附图片）
