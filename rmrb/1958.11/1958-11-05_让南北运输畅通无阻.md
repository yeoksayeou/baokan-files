    Let North-South Transportation Flow Smoothly
    Commentator of this Newspaper
    Currently, transportation across the country remains very strained, falling far short of meeting the needs of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, and the most strained is north-to-south transportation. Due to the imbalanced economic development of various regions in China, coal production is mostly concentrated in North and Northeast China. Since the beginning of this year, the southern provinces have been vigorously developing iron and steel, requiring a large amount of coal, mostly relying on supply from North and Northeast China. This has made the north-to-south transportation task unprecedentedly heavy. However, from north to south, land transportation mainly relies on the Jinpu and Jingguang railways, while the Jinpu Railway and the Jingguang Railway south of Zhengzhou are still single-track. There is no bridge in the Nanjing Pukou area, and vehicles mainly rely on ferries to cross the river. Maritime transport is also limited by the shortage of ships and narrow port terminals, making it impossible to transport more. Thus, the north-south transport line has become the most prominent bottleneck in the national great leap forward, seriously affecting the north-to-south coal transport and north-south material exchange.
    How to solve the tense situation of north-south transportation?
    First, it is necessary to prioritize the transportation of various materials according to the principle of ensuring key points and taking care of general needs. Iron and steel production is the party's and the people's primary task, and the transportation of iron and steel materials remains the top priority. However, while first ensuring iron and steel production, it is also necessary to appropriately take care of general needs, especially for urgently needed materials related to people's livelihood, such as cotton, salt, and so on, as much as possible. That is to say, while ensuring the "food and use" transportation of the iron and steel marshal, it is also necessary to take care of the "clothing and food" transportation of the people. In short, in the daily transportation process, we should make proper arrangements for the transportation of various materials in a timely manner according to the specific situation and according to the degree of importance and urgency.
    Second, we must concentrate our efforts to rapidly complete the double-tracking of the two north-south railway trunk lines, and strive to complete all or most of the double-track laying project of the Jingguang Railway north of Zhuzhou and the Jinpu Railway before the end of the year. In particular, the double-track project from Zhengzhou to Hankou and from Bengbu to Pukou, which are currently under particularly heavy transport pressure, should be completed as soon as possible, the sooner the better.
    Although the task of completing the double-track project of the Jingguang Line and the Jinpu Line before the end of the year is very heavy, as long as we implement the policy of the whole party and the whole people running the railway, with the central and local governments dividing the work and cooperating, with local governments contracting all the earth and stone works and small bridges and culverts, and the railway department concentrating on the construction of large and medium-sized bridges and track laying, we can strive to complete the project on time by working simultaneously. Henan Province has unified the task of railway double-track project and the tasks of industry and agriculture, material procurement, etc., into the plans of local organizations at all levels. Railway construction headquarters have been established from the province, prefectures to cities and counties, giving play to the enthusiasm of the people's communes. The double-track project is progressing rapidly, and the earthwork project will be basically completed by the end of November. We hope that the provincial and municipal party committees along these two railways, like Henan, will strengthen the leadership and supervision of the double-track project and provide the greatest support in terms of manpower and materials.
    Third, the transportation departments should further strengthen the transportation organization work, tap the transportation potential, and strive to transport more. It is particularly important to prevent congestion at stations, lines, and ports, so that north-south transportation is always smooth. For bulk materials with short transportation distances and fixed departure and arrival stations, special trains can be organized to accelerate vehicle turnover. At present, the situation of ships accumulated in various coastal and Yangtze River ports and vehicles accumulated in various factories and mines along the railway lines is still very serious, and this situation must be rapidly improved. The work of water-land combined transport should be further strengthened.
    We believe that by taking the above measures, the north-south transportation situation can be improved.

    让南北运输畅通无阻
    本报评论员
    目前，全国各地运输仍然十分紧张，远远不能满足工农业大跃进的需要，而最紧张的是从北到南的运输。由于我国各个地区的经济发展不平衡，煤炭生产大都集中在华北和东北，今年以来南方各省大搞钢铁，所需大量煤炭，大都仰赖华北和东北供应，这样从北到南的运输任务就空前繁重起来。可是，从北到南，陆上主要依靠津浦、京广两条铁路，而津浦路和京广路郑州以南的线路还是单线，南京浦口地区还没有大桥，过江车辆主要是靠轮渡，海上也受船舶少和港口码头窄小的限制，不能多运，因而南北运输线成为全国大跃进中最突出的狭窄地带，严重影响了北煤南运和南北物资交流。
    怎样解决南北运输的紧张状况呢？
    首先，要根据确保重点和照顾一般的原则对各项物资的运输进行排队。钢铁生产是全党全民的首要任务，有关钢铁物资的运输仍然是第一位。但是在首先保证钢铁生产的前提下，还要适当的照顾一般，特别是对人民生活有关的急需物资如棉、盐等等要尽可能照顾。这就是说，在保证钢铁元帅“吃用”运输的同时，还要照顾人民“吃穿”的运输。总之，在日常运输过程中，应当根据具体情况分轻重缓急，对各种物资的运输及时作妥善的安排。
    其次，要集中力量迅速完成南北两条铁路干线的复线工程，力争京广路株洲以北一段和津沪路的复线铺轨工程在年底以前全部或大部完成，特别是目前运输特别紧张的郑州到汉口和蚌埠到浦口一段的复线工程要早日完成，愈快愈好。
    在年底以前突击完成京广线和津沪线的复线工程，任务虽然很繁重，但是只要贯彻全党全民办铁路的方针，中央和地方分工协作，路基的土石方和小桥、涵洞工程全部由地方包下来，铁道部门集中力量专门搞大中桥梁的施工和铺轨工作，齐头并进，是可以争取按时完成的。河南省把铁路复线工程的任务和工农业、物资采购等任务统一安排在地方各级组织的计划内，从省、专署到市县都成立铁路建设指挥部，发挥人民公社的积极性，复线工程进展很快，土石方工程11月底就基本完成。我们希望这两条铁路沿线的省、市委都像河南一样，加强对复线工程的领导和监督，在人力、物力上给予最大的支援。
    第三，交通运输部门还要进一步加强运输组织工作，挖掘运输潜力，争取多运。特别重要的是防止车站、线路和港口的堵塞，使南北运输经常畅通。对运输距离短、到发站固定的大宗物资，可以组织专门列车，以加速车辆周转。目前，沿海和长江各个港口船舶和铁路沿线各厂矿车辆积压的情况仍然很严重，这种情况要迅速加以改善。水陆联运的工作还要进一步加强。
    我们相信采取以上这些措施，南北运输的情况一定可以得到改善。
