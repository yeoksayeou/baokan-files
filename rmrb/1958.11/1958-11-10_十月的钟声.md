    The Chimes of October
    Yuan Shuipai
    Every time I come to Moscow, spend colorful days, and sleep in the "Leningrad" or "Ukraine" Hotel on the tenth or twenty-seventh floor, I love listening to the chimes of the Spasskaya Tower of the Kremlin the most. Before striking the hour, it slowly plays the first phrase of the "Song of the Motherland" – "We – Our Motherland – How – Vast – and Great" – these ten notes.
    Living in a high-rise building creates a feeling as if you have risen above this great city, close to the top of the tower with the giant clock, overlooking the brightly lit Gorky Street, like a faint silver river on the ground. The stars in the sky cannot compare to the brilliance of the red stars on the rooftops near and far. At this time, when the night is deep and quiet, that line of poetry, struck out by the chimes, is clearly transmitted to my bedside. It is so calm and yet uplifting, steady and yet far-reaching, it evokes my boundless reverie, it gives people an extremely broad and magnificent realm.
    The chimes only play the first phrase of this song. However, it is so familiar to us that as long as it starts, we can fill in the rest ourselves, so that the whole song will ripple in our hearts for a long time. Following the first phrase, the next is: "... it has countless fields and forests," and then: "From Moscow to the distant borders, from southern Russia to the Arctic Ocean, people can walk freely, as if they are the masters of their own country..." What pride-filled language this is! The chimes carrying these words are transmitted from the Kremlin to the entire city of Moscow, and then from this heart of the Soviet Union across the country, and even with the help of radio waves, spread throughout the world, every moment singing the first piece of pure land on earth created by the October Revolution!
    The chimes are immutable, and the written lyrics are even harder to change, but the greater and more brilliant achievements created by the great Soviet people in socialist-communist construction year after year have endowed the phrases played by the Spasskaya Tower with newer and richer meanings as time goes on. What the 200 million Soviet people are proud of is not, as the lyrics emphasize, merely the establishment of the proletarian regime, where the working people "can breathe freely" and "be the masters of their own country," but that the people under such a regime have already left many capitalist countries behind in terms of the output of industrial and agricultural products, and will catch up with the United States completely in the near future; and in terms of science and technology and culture and art, they have achieved tremendous achievements that the old world cannot hope to match.
    I seem to hear the chimes of the Kremlin singing of the launch of three artificial satellites into space, singing of the unprecedented strength of the Soviet Union, which is already forty-one years old since the October Revolution, singing of the significant contributions made by the Soviet Union in safeguarding world peace, singing of the bright future of mankind!
    In the peaceful and quiet night of Moscow, the beautiful chimes sing: "Have never seen another country, that can breathe so freely!" Poet who wrote the lyrics! At that time, you could not have imagined, although you must have hoped so, that the world would change so quickly, and not many years after you wrote the poem, there would be more than one country where people could breathe freely, and they would appear one after another! The Soviet Union is no longer fighting alone, and eleven brothers have grown up around the big brother. In pre-liberation China, the people under reactionary rule could not sing the "Song of the Motherland" to their heart's content, but every time we hummed "Have never seen another country, that can..." we felt a strong sense of envy and longing in our hearts. One day, we too would be able to be so proud. And that day has arrived! However, when we can sing happily, we can no longer say "Have never seen another country." We are very happy that we cannot do this, we have many partners. We sincerely thank our pioneers, they have opened up the road to liberation for us, and set an outstanding example for us. The light of October fills our eyes with light! The Chinese people are striding forward towards the great goal of communism with leaps and bounds!
    The chimes ringing in the sky over Moscow are boundless, they cross the Mediterranean and the pyramids, and reach the African tropical savannah on the Tropic of Capricorn; they fly over the Pacific Ocean and the Caroline Islands, and reach the forests of the Andes Mountains. Whether it is Iraqis or Algerians; whether it is Guineans or Kenyans; whether it is Guatemalans or Venezuelans; they will all hear it. No matter what skin color the people are, the beating of their hearts resonates with it. The victory of the October Revolution, the victory of Marxism-Leninism, and the victory of the Soviet people have inspired the socialist revolution in many countries, and have also influenced many nations still bound by the shackles of colonialism, making their fighting will and revolutionary confidence rise a hundredfold.
    Let the chimes of the Kremlin—the chimes of October—ring even louder!

    十月的钟声
    袁水拍
    每次当我来到莫斯科，度过彩色缤纷的白天，夜晚睡在“列宁格勒”或者“乌克兰”旅馆的第十层或者第二十七层的房间里的时候，我最爱听的是克里姆林宫斯巴斯克塔的钟声。在报时之前，它徐缓地奏出了“祖国进行曲”的第一句——“我们—祖国—多么—辽阔—广大”这十个音。
    住在高层建筑中，会产生一种感觉，仿佛已经升到了这伟大城市的上空，靠近了挂着巨钟的塔顶，俯视灯火辉煌的高尔基大街，好像一条淡淡的地上银河。天上的星斗及不上远近屋顶上的红星灿烂。这时候，夜深人静，那句以钟声敲出的诗，便清晰地传到了我的枕边。它是那样的沉着而又昂扬，稳重而又悠远，它引起我的无边遐想，它给予人们一个极其广阔和壮美的境界。
    钟声仅仅奏出这支歌的第一句。但是，它是那样的为我们所熟悉，只要开个头，其余的便都可以由我们自己来补足了，以致整首歌会在我们心中荡漾，久久不已。紧接着第一句，下面是：“……它有无数田野和森林”，再下面：“打从莫斯科走到遥远的边地，打从南俄走到北冰洋，人们可以自由走来走去，好像自己祖国的主人……”。这是多么充满自豪感的语言啊！载着这些语言的钟声，从克里姆林传到莫斯科全城，再从这苏联的心脏传遍全国，甚至还借助于电波，传遍世界，每时每刻地歌颂这十月革命所开创的人间第一片乐土！
  钟声是不变的，已经写成的歌词更不好改，但是伟大苏联人民年复一年在社会主义—共产主义建设中所创造的更大更辉煌的成就，使斯巴斯克塔所奏出的乐句，随着时间的进展，而赋有更新更丰富的含意。苏联两亿人民所引以自豪的，远不是像歌词中所着重指出的，仅仅是建立起无产阶级的政权，劳动人民“可以自由呼吸”“做自己国家的主人”，而是这样一个政权下的人民，已经在工农业产品的产量方面，把许多资本主义国家抛到了后面，就要在最近的年代里全部赶上美国；在科学技术和文化艺术方面，更是获得了旧世界所不能望其项背的巨大成就。
    我仿佛听见克里姆林的钟声是在歌颂三颗人造卫星的上天，是在歌颂自从十月革命以来，已满四十一岁的苏联的空前强大，是在歌颂苏联在维护世界和平事业中所不断作出的重大贡献，是在歌颂人类的光明的未来！
    和平宁静的莫斯科之夜，优美的钟声在歌唱：“没有见过别的国家，可以这样自由呼吸！”作词的诗人啊！当时你怎么也不会想到，虽则你一定是这样盼望的，世界是变得这样快，在你写诗后没有多少年，人民可以自由呼吸的国家已经不止一个，已经纷纷地出现！苏联再也不是孤军作战，在老大哥的周围，成长起来了十一个兄弟。在解放前的中国，反动统治下的人民是不能称心如意地唱“祖国进行曲”的，但是每一次当我们低吟到“没有见过别的国家，可以……”的时候，我们心里便油然产生了强烈的羡慕和向往的心情。总有一天，我们也能够这样自豪。而这一天已经到来！不过当我们能够畅快歌唱的时候，我们再也不能说“没有见过别的国家”了。我们万分地高兴我们不能这样做，我们有了许多同行的伙伴。我们衷心地感激我们的先行者，他们为我们开辟了解放的道路，为我们树立起卓越的榜样。十月的光辉使我们满眼光明！中国人民正以跃进的步伐向着共产主义的远大目标迈进！
    在莫斯科的上空鸣响着的钟声，是无远弗届的，它越过地中海和金字塔，传到南回归线上的非洲热带草原；它飞过太平洋和加罗林群岛，传到安第斯山脉的森林。不论是伊拉克人，还是阿尔及利亚人；不论是几内亚人，还是怯尼亚人；不论是危地马拉人，还是委内瑞拉人；他们都会听到它。无论是哪一种肤色的人民，他们心脏的搏动是和它共鸣的。十月革命的胜利、马克思列宁主义的胜利、苏联人民的胜利，鼓舞了许多国家的社会主义革命，也影响了许多还束缚在殖民主义枷锁下的民族，使他们斗争的意志、革命的信心百倍地高涨。
    让克里姆林的钟声——十月的钟声，敲得更响吧！
