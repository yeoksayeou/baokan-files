Comprehensive report from our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency: On November 4th, Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki issued a statement at a press conference, announcing that he was prepared to consider implementing the plan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe in two phases.

According to this new plan, in the first phase, the production of nuclear weapons would be prohibited on the territories of Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and the Federal Republic of Germany. At the same time, appropriate supervision measures would be taken. This would freeze nuclear armament in the proposed region.

In the second phase, the conventional forces in the above-mentioned areas would be appropriately reduced, and the complete denuclearization of the area would be implemented simultaneously. In addition, appropriate supervision measures would also be taken.

The proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe was first put forward by the Polish government at the beginning of this year, mainly to eliminate the dangerous situation created in Europe by the United States and the West German government stepping up West German nuclear armament. At that time, this proposal received widespread attention and welcome from world opinion, especially in Europe. However, Western countries, especially the United States government, tried their best to oppose this proposal. They used various unreasonable excuses to refuse to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. One of the main excuses was that prohibiting the production and possession of nuclear weapons in Central Europe would put the Western countries' armies at a disadvantage in terms of conventional armaments compared to the Warsaw Pact armies.

The new plan proposed by Foreign Minister Rapacki links the denuclearization of Central Europe with the reduction of other armaments, which removes the above-mentioned main excuse of Western countries for opposing the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe.

The new plan of Rapacki has aroused great attention within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

However, when commenting on Rapacki's new plan on the 10th, US State Department spokesman Lipp reaffirmed the US opposition to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. He also said that the plan "does not appear to have accepted (Western) fundamental objections to the proposal." His so-called "fundamental objections" refer to the opinions mentioned in a US note in May this year. At that time, the note also rejected the Polish plan outright, citing that the proposal could not solve the problem of German reunification and that the scope was too narrow. This is actually an attempt to entangle the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe with some problems that are difficult to solve for the time being, thereby stifling the plan.

### 波外长提出中欧无原子区新计划  主张分阶段禁止核武器和裁军  美国理屈词穷仍然顽固拒绝

    波外长提出中欧无原子区新计划
    主张分阶段禁止核武器和裁军
    美国理屈词穷仍然顽固拒绝
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：11月4日，波兰外交部长腊帕茨基在记者招待会上发表声明，宣布准备考虑分两个阶段来实行建立中欧无原子武器地区的计划。
    按照这个新计划，在第一阶段中，禁止在波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国领土上生产核武器。同时，采取适当的监督措施。这样就可以冻结建议中的地区里的核军备。
    在第二阶段中，适当地裁减上述地区的常规军队并同时实行这个地区的完全非原子化。另外还要采取适当的监督措施。
    建立中欧无原子武器地区的建议是波兰政府在今年年初首先提出来的，主要是为了消除由于美国和西德政府加紧进行西德原子武装而在欧洲造成的危险局面。当时这个建议受到了全世界、特别是欧洲舆论的广泛注意和欢迎。但是西方国家，特别是美国政府竭力反对这个建议。他们利用各种无理的借口拒绝在中欧建立无原子武器地区。其中一个主要的借口就是所谓：在中欧禁止生产和占有核武器，就会使西方国家军队面临华沙条约军队在常规军备方面的优势。
    腊帕茨基外长提出的新计划把中欧的非原子化同裁减其他军备联系起来，这就解除了西方国家反对在中欧建立无原子地区的上述的主要借口。
    腊帕茨基的新计划提出之后在北大西洋集团国家内部已引起很大注意。
    但是美国国务院发言人里普在10日评论腊帕茨基的新计划时重申美国反对建立中欧无原子武器区的立场。他还说这个计划“看来并没有接受（西方）对于这个方案提出的一些根本性的反对意见。”他的所谓“根本性反对意见”就是指今年5月美国一份照会中所提到的意见。当时这个照会还以该建议不能解决德国统一问题以及范围太窄等等而一口拒绝了波兰的计划。这实际上是要把建立中欧无原子地区的建议跟一些一时还难于解决的问题纠缠一起，从而来扼杀这个计划。
