    Ode to the East Wind
  Two camps are not the same; a boat relies on its rudder, an arrow relies on its bow, and the dispersal of dark clouds relies on the East Wind. The East Wind blows stronger and stronger, and the power of peace is immense.
    (Jiang Zonghua, Navy Unit) The red sun rises in the East, two camps are not the same. China and the Soviet Union have great leaps in production, while British and American workers are on strike.
    (Liu Chunxiang, Jieyang, Guangdong) The red satellite passes through the sky, seen with his own eyes by old man Wang Shen. The East Wind prevails over the West Wind, making him feel as happy as if he tasted sugar.
    (Old City District, Luoyang, Henan)
  The hearts of the Chinese and Soviet people are linked together. Red flowers bloom all over the mountains, the Chinese and Soviet people are one family. Daffodils bloom with interconnected roots, the hearts of the Chinese and Soviet people are linked together. Flocks of white doves fly all over the sky, the unity of China and the Soviet Union will protect peace.
        (Inner Mongolia Climbing Song)
  Red Satellite hums Red Satellite hums, flying West then flying East, flying to bring great changes in the climate, the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. Red Satellite hums, flying West then flying East, Chang'e in the moon sees it, and wants to return to China to be a worker. Red Satellite hums, flying West then flying East, Soviet science has great achievements, making the American imperialists' heads ache. Red Satellite hums, flying West then flying East, humanity wants to go to the planets, and the song of peace resounds in the high sky.
        (Beibei, Chongqing, Sichuan) There has never been a door to heaven, except for the immortal Lü Dongbin, but it's wonderful that the Soviets have a great invention, and artificial satellites are making havoc in the Heavenly Palace.
    (Yu Genhua, Xinchang, Zhejiang) Riding a horse is not as good as watching a satellite, ten thousand miles seem like a blink of an eye. Unveiling the secrets of the universe, orbiting the Earth non-stop.
  (Lin Baotian, Zhangjiakou Railway Works Section)

    东风颂
  两个阵营不相同船靠舵，箭靠弓，乌云吹散靠东风，东风越吹越强盛，和平力量大无穷。
    （海军某部　姜宗华）太阳升起东方红，两个阵营不相同，中苏生产大跃进，英美工人大罢工。
    （广东揭阳　刘春香）红色卫星天空过，王申老汉亲眼见，东风胜来西风败，心里高兴如糖甜。
    （河南洛阳老城区）
  中苏人民心连心满山坡坡开红花，中苏人民是一家。水仙花开根连根，中苏人民心连心。一阵阵白鸽漫天天飞，中苏团结把和平来保卫。
        （内蒙古爬山调）
  红色卫星嗡嗡嗡红色卫星嗡嗡嗡，飞到西来飞到东，飞得气候大变化，东风压倒西风。红色卫星嗡嗡嗡，飞到西来飞到东，月里嫦娥看见了，想回中国当女工。红色卫星嗡嗡嗡，飞到西来飞到东，苏联科学成就大，气得美帝脑壳痛。红色卫星嗡嗡嗡，飞到西来飞到东，人类要到星球去，和平歌声响高空。
        （四川重庆北碚）上天从来没有门，除非神仙吕洞宾，可喜苏联好发明，人造卫星闹天宫。
    （浙江新昌俞　艮华）骑马不如望卫星，万里好像眨眼睛。揭破宇宙的秘密，围绕地球飞不停。
  （张家口铁路工务段蔺宝田）
