Xinhua News Agency, November 8th, Taipei Dispatch: According to an announcement today by the U.S. Taiwan Defense Command, the U.S. "Military Aid Program Inspection Group" will fly from Japan to Taipei tomorrow. They are scheduled to stay in Taiwan for three days, inspecting U.S. military bases and Chiang Kai-shek's military facilities, and will hold meetings with responsible officials of the U.S. Taiwan Defense Command and Chiang's military. This inspection group is led by Shaf, Assistant Secretary of Defense of the United States.

At the same time, Bauke, the deputy head of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan, clamored while inspecting Chiang's troops in Fengshan, Kaohsiung yesterday, saying that the United States has recently shipped many "new types of weapons" to Taiwan in order to make Chiang Kai-shek's army a "modernized force." Bauke implied that there would be "more of the latest weapons" continuously shipped to Taiwan. It is worth noting that Bauke's admission that the United States has handed over "new weapons" to Chiang's army was made after Chiang's army on Kinmen committed the crime of using poison gas shells on November 3 with "U.S.-aid" weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, November 8th, Washington Dispatch: U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy once again issued a clamor to interfere in China's internal affairs at a dinner in San Antonio, Texas, on the 7th. He said that the United States will "not allow" China to liberate the coastal islands "by force or threat of force."

At this dinner, McElroy shamelessly declared to a group of capitalists that the United States' "will" to "aid" Chiang Kai-shek in "defending" the coastal islands has clearly shown that it will not allow one of its "allies" to "be driven out of its own territory by force."

McElroy recently returned to the United States after completing his so-called "world tour." During this "tour," he also carried out a series of activities in Taiwan.

    美国继续运送武器给台湾
    麦克耳罗伊叫嚣坚持要干涉我内政
    新华社8日讯　台北消息：据侵台美军司令部今天宣布，美国“军援计划考察团”将在明天由日本飞到台北，他们预定在台湾逗留三天，视察美军基地和蒋军的设施，并将同侵台美军和蒋军的负责官员举行会议。这个考察团由美国国防部助理部长帮办夏夫率领。
    同时，美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团副团长鲍凯昨天在高雄凤山视察蒋军的时候叫嚷说，美国最近已经把许多“新式武器”运到台湾，以便使蒋介石陆军成为一支“现代化的部队。”鲍凯暗示还有“更多最新式武器”将源源运到台湾。值得注意的是，鲍凯这番承认美国已经把“新式武器”交给蒋军的谈话，是在金门蒋军在11月3日利用“美援”武器犯下了使用毒气炮弹的罪行后发表的。
    新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊7日在得克萨斯州圣安多尼城的一次晚餐会上又一次发出干涉中国内政的叫嚣，他说，美国将“不允许”中国“使用武力或武力威胁”解放沿海岛屿。
    麦克耳罗伊在这次晚餐会上对一群资本家们无耻地宣称，美国“援助”蒋介石“保卫”沿海岛屿的“意志”已经清楚地表明它将不允许它的“盟国”之一“被武力威胁赶出它自己的领土”。
    麦克耳罗伊不久前刚刚结束了他所谓的“世界旅行”回到美国。在这次“旅行”中他也曾在台湾进行了一系列的活动。
