Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 15th: In a 4.73 mu cotton field in the Changchongkou Commune, Mianyang County, Hubei Province, as of November 5th, 39,908 jin of dry seed cotton had been picked, averaging 8,437 jin of seed cotton per mu. There are still more than ten cotton bolls per plant.

In recent days, crowds of people who have heard the news and come to visit this high-yield cotton field that has created an amazing record have been coming in an endless stream. According to several measurements by the acceptance team organized by the Jingzhou Prefectural Committee and the Mianyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, this cotton field has an average of 7,148 plants per mu, with an average plant height of four to five feet. Each plant has twenty-six fruiting branches, bearing an average of one hundred and five cotton bolls, each full and plump, the largest being the size of an egg. Usually, about one hundred cotton bolls are needed to produce one jin of seed cotton, but in this field, only seventy cotton bolls or so are needed to produce one jin of seed cotton. On average, only a little over fifty early bolls are needed.

This cotton field is an experimental plot of Xiong Jicai, the former head of Huangtan Township, Yang Muzhen, the secretary of the Huangyi Brigade branch, Liu Changsheng, the director of the Women's Federation, and Zhou Tiancheng, the head of the technology section. Last year, this land was also planted with cotton, but the cotton plants were only a foot tall, with an average yield of forty jin of ginned cotton per mu. Why was there such a leap in production this year? The reporter interviewed the owners of the experimental field about this. According to them, the main reason is that they listened to the Party, emancipated their minds, and broke superstitions. They visited Macheng and other advanced cotton-producing areas in the county as many as nine times, and revised the plan three times. The original target was 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu, then it was changed to 2,000 jin, and finally increased to 10,000 jin. Each time the target was changed, measures were taken to firmly implement effective measures for cotton production increase in terms of water, soil, fertilizer, density, early planting, tidiness, preservation, and prevention, so that there were no pests, no weeds, no drought or waterlogging, no soil compaction, and no fertilizer deficiency.

Because this cotton field was particularly outstanding, it was harvested and weighed separately from the beginning. In addition to the acceptance team organized by the prefecture and county committees, Xia Fuqing and Chen Wenjun, the secretaries of the county committee, and Yu Chuanbin, associate researcher of the Central China Agricultural Science Institute, and more than twenty other people, rushed to the site to conduct field investigations and repeatedly measured the area.

    棉花产量创造惊人纪录
    长埫口公社一块棉田亩产八千多斤
    据新华社武汉15日电　在湖北省沔阳县长埫口公社一块四点七三亩的棉田，到11月5日止，已经拣回干籽棉三万九千九百零八斤，平均亩产籽棉八千四百三十七斤。现在每株还有十多个棉桃。
    最近几天，闻讯前往这块创造惊人纪录的丰产棉田参观的人群，络绎不绝。根据中共荆州地委、沔阳县委组织的验收组数次测算，这块棉田平均每亩有七千一百四十八株，一般株高四尺到五尺。每株有二十六个果枝，平均结有一百零五个棉桃，个个饱满，最大的有鸡蛋那样大。通常一百个左右棉桃才有一斤籽棉，这块地七十来个棉桃就有一斤籽棉了，伏桃平均只需要五十多个。
    这块棉地是原黄潭乡乡长熊继才、黄益中队支部书记杨木珍、妇联主任刘长生和技术股长周天成等人的试验田。去年这块地也是种的棉花，但是棉株只有尺把高，平均亩产皮棉四十斤。为什么今年能飞跃增产呢？记者为此访问了试验田的主人。根据他们谈：主要是听了党的话，解放了思想，破除了迷信的结果。他们曾到麻城和本县棉花先进地区参观学习达九次之多，并且先后修改三次规划。原来的指标是亩产籽棉一千斤，后来改为二千斤，最后增加到一万斤。每改一次指标跟着就狠狠地抓措施，对棉花增产有效的水、土、肥、密、早、整、保、防等措施都执行得比较彻底，做到了无虫、无草、无旱涝、无板结、无脱肥。
    由于这片棉花特别出众，因此一开始就采取了单收、单秤。参加验收的，除地、县委组织的验收组外，县委书记夏甫庆、陈文均，华中农业科学研究所副研究员余传斌二十多人，都曾赶到现场，作了田间调查、并且反复丈量了面积。
