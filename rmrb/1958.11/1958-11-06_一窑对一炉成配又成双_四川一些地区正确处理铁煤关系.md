One Kiln for One Furnace, Forming Pairs
Some Areas in Sichuan Correctly Handle the Relationship Between Iron and Coal
    (Our newspaper's Chongqing dispatch) In Sichuan's Fuling, Wanxian, Daxian, Luzhou, and other regions, they have adopted the method of one kiln following one furnace, or several furnaces to one kiln, to ensure that the fuel needed by the furnace groups is fully supplied.
    Regarding the handling of the relationship between iron and coal, layout, and other issues, the cadres and masses in many special districts and counties in Sichuan have gone through some twists and turns. At the beginning, everyone only paid attention to the construction of indigenous blast furnaces, and did not pay enough attention to how to keep up with coal mining, coking, and other work accordingly. When a large number of indigenous blast furnaces were ignited and put into production, they realized that the fuel supply was insufficient, and only then did they feel the problem was serious. For example, in the first few days of the high-yield week from October 17th to 20th, more than 120,000 indigenous furnaces were built throughout the province. The cadres and the masses basically passed the barrier of mastering ironmaking technology, and their confidence was very high, but because the fuel could not keep up, only more than 40,000 furnaces were put into production, and the output was slow to increase. Later, the special districts and counties were determined to seize coal, which reversed this passive situation. This fact seriously educated everyone that coal and iron production must be comprehensively arranged. The cadres and masses in Fuling, Wanxian, and many other special districts originally proposed the goal of one kiln following one furnace or two furnaces to one kiln. Now they have a deeper understanding that it is a good way to ensure the normal production of blast furnaces to establish fixed coal bases centered on small iron and steel bases and normally producing furnace groups, and to plan how much coal to mine according to how much iron is produced.
    Gulin County, which first won the banner of Sichuan's thousand-ton county, has put more than 500 furnaces into production. Thanks to the support of more than 600 small coal kilns, there are more than one-to-one, so the percentage of furnaces that normally produce iron reaches 88.92%. The Fuling Special District has built large coal kiln groups around the blast furnace groups. At present, it has realized two furnaces and one kiln. These coal kilns are all near the blast furnaces. Coal and iron production are closely integrated, forming a set of management organizations, which is convenient for unified arrangement of production and gradually forming small iron and steel bases. It can also greatly save manpower and material resources and facilitate strengthening the Party's leadership and unified management. Now, many regions have established mining area Party committees and management committees centered on blast furnace groups, iron mines, and coal mines, dividing manpower into several fronts such as smelting, mining, and coal mining, transportation, etc., contracting work, contracting production, and assigning special personnel to be responsible. In this way, the mining area uses coal by itself and considers and arranges mining by itself, which is of great benefit to giving play to the enthusiasm of local cadres and the masses.

### 一窑对一炉成配又成双  四川一些地区正确处理铁煤关系

    一窑对一炉成配又成双
    四川一些地区正确处理铁煤关系
    本报重庆电　四川涪陵、万县、达县、泸州等专区采取一窑跟一炉，或者数炉对一窑的办法，保证炉群所需的燃料得到充分供应。
    在处理铁与煤的关系、布局等问题上，四川许多专、县的干部、群众经过了一番曲折。开始，大家只注意到抓土高炉的建设，对于把采煤、炼焦等工作如何相应地跟上去却注意不够。等到大批土高炉点火投入生产，发现燃料供应不足，才感到问题严重。例如，10月17日到20日高产周的头几天，全省建成的土炉子十二万个以上，干部、群众基本上过了掌握炼铁技术这一关，信心很大，就是因为燃料跟不上，投入生产的炉子只有四万多个，产量迟迟跃不上去。后来各专县下定决心抓煤，才扭转了这个被动局面。这个事实，严肃地教育大家，煤铁生产必须全面安排。涪陵、万县等许多专区的干部、群众原来就提出一窑跟一炉或两炉对一窑的奋斗目标，现在他们更深刻地体会到以小钢铁基地、生产正常的炉群为中心，建立固定的煤炭基地作配合，按产铁多少来计划采煤多少，是保证高炉正常生产的好办法。
    首夺四川千吨县帅旗的古蔺县，投入生产的炉子五百多个，由于有六百多座小煤窑的支持，一对一还有多，因此正常出铁的炉子达到88.92％。涪陵专区围绕高炉群大建煤窑群，目前已实现二炉一窑，这些煤窑都在高炉附近，煤、铁生产密切结合，搞成一套管理机构，既便于统一安排生产、逐步形成小型钢铁基地，又可大量节省人力、物力，便于加强党的领导和统一管理。现在许多地区都以高炉群、铁矿、煤矿为中心，成立矿区党委和管理委员会，把人力分成冶炼、采矿、采煤、运输等几条战线，包工、包产，专人负责。这样，矿区自己用煤，自己来考虑、安排开采，对发挥当地干部、群众积极性有很大好处。
