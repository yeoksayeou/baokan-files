　　Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 13th: In a speech delivered at a mass rally held in Minya, Upper Egypt, on the evening of the 13th, President Nasser of the United Arab Republic condemned imperialism for adopting new means to deal with the Arab people after its actions of suppressing the Arab people by force had failed. He emphasized that the united Arab people will defeat the new conspiracies of imperialism. He said, "The imperialists are now using money to buy people over, and plotting conspiracies and deceptions to sow discord. They have also brought out their frequently used weapons—imperialist agents." He pointed out, however, "These agents are no longer able to betray the people, because the people of every Arab country are now able to detect imperialism and its agents."

　　He said, "The imperialists are strengthening the old agents and creating new agents, but they will be defeated."

　　He continued, imperialism has launched a war against the Arab nation: a war of broadcasting, a psychological war, a war of conspiracies, slander, threats, and rumors, because imperialism feels that the implementation of Arab nationalism means that the people of Arab countries will refuse to participate in conventions, refuse to accept dependence policies, and will adhere to independent policies, and will not be appendages of imperialism.

　　He said that the enemies of the Arab people want to sow seeds of discord among the Arab people, which cannot succeed. "The Arab people, who united on the day the Suez Canal incident occurred, will continue to unite in the future, and will be firmly united."

　　President Nasser said that the Arab people used the weapon of unity to defeat the armed aggression of imperialism in the last crisis. They will use the same weapon to overcome any new crises that may occur.

　　When explaining Arab nationalism, President Nasser said, "Arab nationalism is not the leadership of an individual; it is not to merge one Arab country with another; it is not to unite it with another Arab country without the consent of an Arab country."

　　He also said that Arab nationalism means unity, alliance, and solidarity, but all of this must be built on truth and for the benefit of the Arabs, not for the benefit of imperialism. He said that the Arab world and every Arab country should be independent.

　　He also said that the victory of the Iraqi people and "Baghdad is the victory of every Arab in every Arab country."

　　When talking about the Soviet loan to the United Arab Republic to build the High Dam, President Nasser said, "Our will has triumphed, and this victory has greatly surprised the imperialists and also surprised the agents of imperialism."

　　He refuted the rumors spread by the imperialists that the Soviet Union had once refused to provide loans to Egypt to finance the construction of the High Dam. President Nasser said that it was the imperialists themselves who refused to provide loans. He said, "They refused to give help in an embarrassing way. We nationalized the Suez Canal so that imperialism would realize that although we are a small country, and we do not have atomic bombs, nor do we have a large number of aircraft, we can maintain our independence and our dignity."

　　Speaking of the economic pressure of imperialism, President Nasser said, "Imperialism has tried to impose an economic blockade on us and has tried to make us feel that our independence will bring us disastrous consequences. But we have fought and endured all kinds of sacrifices, and today, our markets are full of our own products."

　　Vice President of the United Arab Republic, Marshal Amir, presided over the mass rally. In his speech, he expressed his gratitude for the support given by the people of Arab countries to the United Arab Republic. He also mentioned the blow that the Iraqi revolution gave to imperialism.

　　Vice President Haurani and some ministers of the central and regional governments of the United Arab Republic also delivered speeches at the rally.

    纳赛尔总统谴责帝国主义在阿拉伯人中散播纠纷阿
    拉伯人决心粉碎敌人新阴谋
    没有原子弹和大量飞机的小国能够维护自己独立
    新华社开罗13日电　阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔13日晚间在上埃及米尼亚地方举行的群众大会上发表演说时，谴责帝国主义在用武力镇压阿拉伯人民的行动失败以后，正在采取新的手段来对付阿拉伯人民。他强调指出，团结一致的阿拉伯人民将打败帝国主义的新阴谋。他说，“帝国主义者现在正在利用金钱收买和策划阴谋和欺骗的办法来散播纠纷。他们还拿出了他们经常使用的武器——帝国主义代理人。”他指出，但是，“这些代理人现在已不再能够出卖人民，因为每一个阿拉伯国家的人民已经能够发现帝国主义和它的代理人。”
    他说，“帝国主义者正在加强老的代理人，并且创造新的代理人，但是他们将被击败。”
    他接着说，帝国主义已经对阿拉伯民族发动了一场战争：广播战争、心理战争、阴谋、污蔑、威胁和谣言的战争，因为帝国主义感到，贯彻阿拉伯民族主义意味着阿拉伯各国人民将拒绝参加公约，不接受依附政策，而要坚持独立的政策，不作帝国主义的附庸。
    他说，阿拉伯人民的敌人想在阿拉伯人民当中散播不和的种子，这是不可能成功的。“在塞得港事件发生的那一天已经团结起来的阿拉伯人民将来还会团结下去，而且将牢固地团结在一起。”
    纳赛尔总统说，阿拉伯人民使用团结的武器在上一次危机中打败了帝国主义的武装侵略。他们将使用同样的武器来克服可能发生的新危机。
    纳赛尔总统在解释阿拉伯民族主义的时候说，“阿拉伯民族主义不是一个个人的领导；不是要把一个阿拉伯国家同另一个阿拉伯国家合并起来；不是在没有得到一个阿拉伯国家的同意以前把它同另一个阿拉伯国家联合起来。”
    他还说，阿拉伯民族主义意味着联合、联盟和团结，但是所有这一切都必须建立在真理上面，是为了阿拉伯人的利益而不是为了帝国主义的利益。他说，阿拉伯世界和每个阿拉伯国家都应该是独立的。
    他还说，伊拉克人民和“巴格达的胜利是每一个阿拉伯国家中每一个阿拉伯人的胜利”。
    纳赛尔总统在谈到苏联贷款给阿拉伯联合共和国修建高水坝问题时说，“我们的意志胜利了，这一胜利使帝国主义感到大为惊讶，也使帝国主义的代理人感到大为惊讶”。
    他驳斥了帝国主义者散布的谣言，它说，苏联曾经一度拒绝向埃及提供资助高水坝建设费用的贷款。纳赛尔总统说，拒绝提供贷款的恰恰是帝国主义者自己。他说，“他们用使人难堪的方式拒绝给予帮助。我们就把苏伊士运河收归国有，以便让帝国主义认识到，虽然我们是小国，而且也没有原子弹，也没有大量飞机，但是我们能够维护我们的独立和我们的尊严。”
    谈到帝国主义的经济压力时，纳赛尔总统说，“帝国主义曾经试图把经济封锁强加在我们身上，并且试图使我们感到我们的独立会为我们带来灾难性的后果。但是我们进行了斗争，并且忍受了各种各样的牺牲，今天，在我们的市场里充满了我们自己的产品。”
    阿拉伯联合共和国副总统阿密尔元帅主持了这次群众大会。他在讲话时对阿拉伯各国人民给予阿联的支持表示谢意。他还提到伊拉克革命给予帝国主义的打击。
    副总统胡拉尼以及阿联中央和地区政府的一些部长也在大会上发表了讲话。
