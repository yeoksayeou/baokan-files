    Splitting Mountains to Build Water Conservancy, Irrigating Farmlands Everywhere
    (Reported by this newspaper) The water conservancy project to irrigate 100,000 "町步" of dry land in North Pyongan Province using the water of the Yalu River between China and North Korea, as instructed by Premier Kim Il-sung, has made great progress since the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea.

    After the completion of this project, the water of the Yalu River drawn from Ryongchon and Uiju will flow into hundreds of reservoirs, irrigating more than 40,000 "町步" of dry land, 25,000 "町步" of paddy fields, and saline-alkali land in more than ten counties in North Pyongan Province.

    Currently, this project is being carried out in four stages. The first stage of the project started in early September this year and will be completed by the spring of next year.

    At present, more than 7,800 people are working selflessly on the construction site, most of whom are farmers from Uiju County.

    The entire project will be completed in the last year of the first Five-Year Plan (1957-1961).

    In addition, irrigation projects are also being widely constructed in other areas, such as the Giyang irrigation project with an irrigation area of 50,000 "町步" and the Uyon-dong irrigation project with an irrigation area of 30,000 "町步"; as well as irrigation projects of various sizes in South Hwanghae Province, South Pyongan Province, Kangwon Province, and South Hamgyong Province. In South Hamgyong Province and Kangwon Province, projects to split mountains and control water are also being vigorously carried out.

    In the next two or three years, 1.12 million to 1.4 million "町步" of paddy and dry fields (700,000 "町步" each) in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will be completely free from drought and flood disasters and will become perennially abundant fields with sufficient water sources. It is expected that a beautiful scene of an annual output of 7 million tons of grain will appear in the near future. (Attached picture)

### 劈山修水利　灌溉遍农田

    劈山修水利　灌溉遍农田
    本报讯　根据金日成首相指示兴建的、利用中朝鸭绿江水在平安北道灌溉十万町步旱地的水利工程，在朝鲜劳动党中央委员会9月全会以后，有了飞跃的进展。
    这个工程完成以后，从龙川和义州引上来的鸭绿江水，将流入数百个水库，使平安北道十多个郡内的四万多町步旱田、两万五千多町步水田和盐碱地得到灌溉。
    目前，这个工程分为四个阶段进行。第一阶段的工程已从今年9月上旬开始动工，到明年春季就可完成。
    现在，在工地上有七千八百多人正在进行着忘我的劳动，其中大部分是义州郡的农民。
    整个工程，到第一个五年计划（1957—1961年）的最末一年，将全部完工。
    此外，其他各地，也都在广泛地修建灌溉工程，如拥有五万町步灌溉面积的歧阳灌溉工程和三万町步灌溉面积的于延屯灌溉工程；以及在黄海南道、平安南道、江原道、咸镜南道等地区的大小不同的灌溉工程。在咸镜南道和江原道，也正在大力进行着劈山治水的工程。
    在今后二、三年内，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国一百十二万至一百四十万町步的水旱田（各有七十万町步）将完全根除水旱灾，并将成为水源充足的万年丰收田。预计在不久的将来，就可出现年产七百万吨谷物的美景。（附图片）
