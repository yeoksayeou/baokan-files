　　He concluded by shouting, "Long live the unbreakable friendship and solidarity between the Korean and Vietnamese peoples!" "Long live the invincible unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!"

　　In his speech, Premier Kim Il-sung first emphasized that Korea and Vietnam are both in a state of national division due to the interference of U.S. imperialism. The peoples of the two countries face similar situations and share the same goals, and have always worked together and shared weal and woe in the struggle against a common enemy.

　　Premier Kim Il-sung said: The Vietnamese people defeated the armed aggression of French imperialism, not only defending their freedom and independence, but also staunchly safeguarding the outpost of the socialist camp in Southeast Asia.

　　Premier Kim Il-sung sternly condemned the barbaric acts of U.S. imperialism in controlling South Vietnam and forcibly occupying South Korea. He said that today, U.S. imperialism still wants to realize its dirty aggressive ambitions. However, imperialism, which is heading towards death, is gravely mistaken. The era in which imperialists could act as masters in the East has forever passed. Today, the people of the East have become the masters of their own destiny.

　　Premier Kim Il-sung said: The peoples of our two countries, Korea and Vietnam, have defeated imperialist armed aggression in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. This clearly shows that no imperialist aggressor can stop our advance on the road to struggle for the unification and independence of our motherland.

　　Premier Kim Il-sung's inspiring speech repeatedly won warm applause and cheers from the audience.

　　In his speech, President Ho Chi Minh thanked Premier Kim Il-sung for his enthusiastic speech on behalf of the Vietnamese people, and called on the Vietnamese people to advance shoulder to shoulder with the Korean people in the cause of socialist construction.

    上午十一时，插着朝越国旗的银白色专机降落在阳光灿烂的嘉林机场上，金日成首相出现在飞机门口，他举手向近三千的欢呼的群众致意，然后步下飞机。在他后边的是代表团团员：朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱、内阁副首相兼外务相南日、民族保卫相金光侠和教育文化相李一卿等，代表团团员、朝鲜驻越南大使金昌哲也同机前来。
    越南民主共和国总理范文同迎上前去，同金日成首相等热烈握手。同范总理一起上前迎接的有：副总理长征、潘继遂、武元甲，外交部副部长雍文谦等。
    乐队奏起了雄壮的朝越两国国歌。范文同总理陪同金日成首相检阅了仪仗队。
    金日成首相同欢迎群众见面时，雷动的掌声和欢呼声响彻云霄。一把把鲜花递向了越南人民所敬爱的金日成首相。
    范文同总理在机场致词，向金日成和代表团全体人员致敬。他说：“以金日成首相为首的朝鲜政府代表团到越南来访问，一定会进一步加强两国人民之间的友谊和互助合作。我们两国人民经常肩并肩地决心为在北方建设新的生活和统一我们的祖国而奋斗，同时，也为保卫世界和平贡献出一分力量。”
    金日成首相接着讲话，他向越南政府和人民的热诚欢迎表示感谢。
    他说：“朝鲜人民对越南人民原有深厚的友谊，在反对共同的敌人的艰苦斗争中，我们两国人民曾经不断地互相支援。”
    他说：“在反对帝国主义侵略者的激烈的斗争中，我们两国人民都取得了辉煌的胜利，坚决地保卫了自己的祖国的自由和独立。”
    他最后高呼：“朝越两国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊和团结万岁！”“以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的不可战胜的团结一致万岁！”
    金日成首相讲话以后，范文同总理陪同他登上敞篷汽车，在乐队的演奏和群众的欢呼声中离开机场，前往河内市区。
    河内市今天到处红旗飘扬。在从机场通往主席府的十公里长的路上，挂满了巨幅的欢迎标语，三万多群众夹道欢迎金日成首相和朝鲜政府代表团，男女老幼把鲜花、纸花伴着火热的情意撒向敬爱的朝鲜贵宾。金日成首相和范文同总理不断地向沸腾的人群挥手致意。
