Xinhua News Agency, November 13th: In order to seize the opportunity to complete this year's basic construction plan quickly, well, and economically, and to create favorable conditions for larger-scale basic construction work next year, the collaboration zones held basic construction work conferences in Tianjin, Harbin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Xi'an, Chongqing, and Guangzhou respectively from late September to mid-October. Participants included directors and deputy directors of the collaboration zones, Party secretaries, governors, and deputy governors of provinces (cities) and autonomous regions, ministers and vice-ministers of relevant central departments, deputy directors of the State Capital Construction Commission, and heads of relevant departments and bureaus of provinces (cities) and autonomous regions, and central ministries and commissions. Chen Yun, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the State Capital Construction Commission, participated in the basic construction conferences of the North China, Northeast, and Northwest Collaboration Zones successively, and gave important instructions on basic construction work.

At the basic construction work conferences held in each collaboration zone, the completion of this year's basic construction plan was reviewed, problems existing in the current basic construction work were studied, and the new situation of basic construction, project alignment, industrial layout, design work, rapid construction, manufacturing of supporting equipment, construction preparations for this winter and next spring, strengthening Party leadership in basic construction work, and launching mass movements were emphatically discussed.

Judging from the situation reflected at the meetings, the achievements in basic construction this year are enormous. The basic construction investment completed from January to September increased by more than double compared to the same period last year, accounting for more than 60% of the national annual plan. Some key projects have been completed and put into production on schedule or ahead of schedule. However, the completion situation in various regions is uneven. Some provinces, cities, and autonomous regions are far from completing their annual plans, and the construction tasks for the fourth quarter are still very heavy. It is necessary to mobilize the masses to work hard to successfully complete this year's basic construction plan.

Based on the new situation of the whole Party and the whole people running industry in a big way and the various targets for the great leap forward in industry and agriculture next year, the scale of basic construction in China in 1959 will increase several times compared to this year. The meeting believes that basic construction work must be completed as a major task of the whole Party.

Projects Must Be Strictly Aligned

Regarding the order of construction of basic construction projects. In view of the fact that this year and next year there are more urgently needed construction projects than the supply of materials, and the supply of materials and equipment also has priorities, the meeting believes that the order of basic construction projects must be aligned to ensure key construction and strive for a batch of the most urgently needed projects to be put into production as soon as possible, and to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results in construction. Generally speaking, the order of alignment should be first "marshal" and "pioneer" projects, followed by general productive enterprises, and third by non-productive construction. However, provinces, cities, and autonomous regions can have different priorities according to the different situations in each region. At the same time, in the middle of the alignment, it should be seen that there are minor points in the key points, and there are also key points in the minor points. For "missing link" projects of national significance and construction projects with special political tasks, care should be taken during alignment, and attention should be paid to completing the finishing projects to ensure that newly built enterprises are put into production in a timely manner. In particular, basic construction projects such as indigenous and small blast furnaces, coal, and transportation needed for 10.7 million tons of steel must be given priority in alignment in order to gradually arm the small and indigenous blast furnaces and ensure their normal production.

The information provided at the meeting shows that in order to conduct serious and strict alignment of construction projects, two tasks must be done well: first, ideological work for cadres, and second, building materials and construction forces should be centrally controlled by the Party committees of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and used in a unified manner.

Rapid Construction Should Become a Normal Construction Method

Regarding rapid construction. "Batch assault, rapid construction" is a revolution in construction and installation enterprises, which can shorten the construction period and reduce construction costs. Various places have gained some experience in rapid construction. The meeting believes that this construction method should become a normal construction method in China's basic construction. The current tasks are: (1) To convene on-site meetings to summarize experience and promote it in a planned manner; (2) To gradually reform the past inappropriate labor organization, wage system, and construction management system to suit the needs of rapid construction; (3) Especially important is to turn this method into a broad mass movement and combine it with the current technical innovation movement in construction and installation work.

Combination of Large, Medium, and Small, with Medium and Small as the Main Focus

Regarding industrial layout. Due to the new situation of rural people's communes and mass movements in industrial construction, it is required that industry and agriculture be combined, with medium and small-sized enterprises as the main focus, and distributed in a decentralized manner. Judging from the current industrial layout in several provinces and cities, more enterprises have been arranged in some old large and medium-sized cities, and some enterprises have become larger in scale, resulting in the rapid expansion of the cities. The meeting believes that to rationally solve the problem of industrial layout, the following three issues should be noted at present: (1) We must adhere to the central government's policy of "combining large, medium, and small-sized enterprises, with medium and small-sized enterprises as the main focus." Of course, large factories are the backbone of industry. From a national perspective, it is necessary to build some large factories, but small and medium-sized factories should be the main ones and account for the majority in terms of product quantity.

(2) The meeting believes that it is necessary to continue to criticize the idea of excessive concentration of industrial enterprises. The layout of construction projects should be as decentralized as possible to avoid excessive concentration. In order to speed up the construction speed, it is necessary to carry out some expansions or new constructions in the original factories in large cities, but they should not be over-concentrated. More factories should be built in small and medium-sized cities, which is not only of great significance at present, but also of greater significance in the long run. For the realization of the combination of industry and agriculture, the elimination of urban-rural differences, and the transition to communism, decentralized construction can achieve great speed and great savings.

(3) The meeting believes that the establishment of a national and regional industrial system should be carried out step by step. First, the whole country, and then a relatively complete industrial system should be established in each collaboration zone. If each province and autonomous region tries to build an industrial system at present, as a result, materials and equipment will be scattered, which will inevitably affect the construction progress of the whole country and the collaboration zones. With a national industrial system, the industrial construction of the collaboration zones will be guaranteed. With the establishment of the industrial system in the collaboration zones, the industrial construction of each province will be guaranteed. Therefore, in the establishment of the industrial system, it is necessary to overcome the tendency of each region not distinguishing between priorities, urgency, and construction sequence, and wanting to build everything.

"Indigenous and Foreign Combination" Design Methods Need to Be Universally Promoted

Regarding design work. The meeting believes that design work is a key issue in whether construction can be carried out more, faster, better, and more economically. In recent years, the achievements in design work have been great. The situation where design could not keep up with construction has been basically resolved, and the technical level of design has also been greatly improved. However, according to the needs of the situation, the progress of design work is still not enough, and the progress of various design departments is uneven. This is mainly manifested in the implementation of the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results. Civil engineering design has made more significant progress than technological design. The "indigenous and foreign combination" method has not been seriously and universally promoted in design. The meeting believes that "indigenous and foreign combination" should become a design method that is widely and universally adopted in China's basic construction. Otherwise, it will not be possible to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. Of course, the latest technology still needs to be adopted in cutting-edge industrial sectors and a few factories. Otherwise, China's technical level cannot be improved. Since most of the major projects of the Second Five-Year Plan will be launched in the next six months, the design problem is a decisive issue in the next six months. Whether the design of these projects conforms to the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results, it will be too late to review them after they are launched. It is necessary to organize forces to conduct a review of existing designs. Provinces (cities) and autonomous regions and relevant departments of the central government should seriously grasp design work.

Manufacturing of Supporting Equipment Mainly Relies on Self-Reliance

Regarding the manufacturing of supporting equipment. Since the national demand for mechanical supporting equipment will be very large next year, and the tasks of the national machinery manufacturing industry next year are very heavy, there is a problem with the supply of supporting equipment. The meeting believes that this is an extremely important issue and must be arranged in a unified manner as soon as possible. Since there are many types of mechanical equipment, and each type of mechanical equipment is composed of many parts and components, how to organize the supporting production of various equipment is a very complex and arduous task. Under the circumstances that the tasks of the national machinery manufacturing industry are very heavy, supporting manufacturing should mainly rely on self-reliance and cooperation to solve. Provinces and cities should organize supporting companies, and under the leadership of the Party and government, organize supporting work. The First Ministry of Machine Building Industry should also vigorously lead this work. Various places must also squeeze out a part of the production force and uniformly arrange the manufacturing tasks of supporting equipment.

About one-third of the work of basic construction in 1958 needs to be completed in the next two months. At the same time, large-scale basic construction next year must be prepared for construction next spring this winter. The meeting believes that while carrying out winter construction, local building materials such as bricks, tiles, sand, and stones needed for construction next year must be prepared for production in advance. The labor force and transportation capacity required to produce these materials should be arranged in a unified manner with agricultural production, steelmaking, ironmaking, and other needs. In areas where the construction and installation force is insufficient, in addition to drawing some forces from provinces and cities with relatively strong construction forces to support areas with weaker forces, each region should cultivate them through self-reliance as needed.

Strengthen Party Leadership and Thoroughly Follow the Mass Line

The completion of the above tasks requires strengthening the leadership of the local Party committees and carrying out extensive mass movements. Whether it is project alignment, rational industrial layout, or reviewing designs, promoting rapid construction, etc., if there is no leadership from the Party committee and the masses are not mobilized, they will not be done well. Many major issues in basic construction can only be achieved with more, faster, better, and more economical results under the leadership of the Party, fully mobilizing the masses, truly achieving ideological exchange, and overcoming conservative ideas. Therefore, the meeting believes that strengthening Party leadership and carrying out mass movements are the basic guarantees for completing the huge tasks of basic construction next year. It is recommended that Party secretaries of provinces (cities) and autonomous regions lead basic construction work like grasping industrial production. In areas where the tasks of basic construction are greater than the tasks of industrial production, they should lead basic construction work with more energy, and in basic construction work, they should boldly mobilize the masses and thoroughly follow the mass line, explaining the tasks, reasons, and methods to the masses clearly, launching debates among the masses, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses, and striving for brilliant victories on the basic construction front.

    各协作区先后召开基本建设工作会议
    排好队布好局加快建设新企业
    前三季度完成的建设投资比去年同期增加一倍多  各地区的进度很不平衡第四季度的任务还很繁重
    新华社13日讯　为了抓紧时机多快好省地完成今年基本建设计划，并为明年更大规模的基本建设工作创造有利条件，各协作区于9月下旬至10月中旬，先后在天津、哈尔滨、上海、武汉、西安、重庆、广州分别召开了基本建设工作会议，参加会议的有各协作区主任、副主任，各省（市）自治区党委书记、省长、副省长，中央各有关部部长、副部长、国家基本建设委员会副主任和各省（市）自治区、中央各部、委有关厅局的负责人等。国务院副总理兼国家基本建设委员会主任陈云，先后参加了华北、东北、西北协作区的基本建设会议，并对基本建设工作作了重要指示。
    在各协作区召开的基本建设工作会议上，检查了今年基本建设计划的完成情况，研究了当前基本建设工作中存在的问题，在会议中着重讨论了基本建设的新形势、建设项目排队、工业布局、设计工作、快速施工、配套设备的制造、今冬明春的施工准备工作和加强基本建设工作中党的领导、大搞群众运动等问题。
    从会议上反映的情况看，今年基本建设工作的成绩是巨大的，1至9月完成的基本建设投资比去年同期增长一倍多，为国家年度计划的60％以上，有一些重点工程已按期或提前建成投入生产，但是各地区完成的情况是不平衡的，有些省市自治区距完成年度计划还差的很远，第四季度的建设任务仍然很繁重。必须发动群众努力工作以胜利完成今年的基本建设计划。
    根据最近全党全民大办工业的新形势和明年工农业大跃进的各项指标来看，1959年我国基本建设的规模比今年将要有成倍的增长，会议认为必须把基本建设工作当作全党的重大任务来完成。
    建设项目必须进行严格的排队
    关于基本建设项目施工先后的排队问题。鉴于今年与明年急需建设项目多于材料的供应，并且材料设备供应也有先有后，会议认为基本建设项目建设的先后必须进行排队，以保证重点建设和争取一批最急需的项目早日投入生产，实现建设中的多快好省。排队的次序，一般的说应该是先“元帅”、“先行”项目，其次是一般生产性企业，第三是非生产性的建设。但是各省、市、自治区可以根据各地区的不同情况有不同的重点，同时在排队中间，应该看到重点中有轻点，轻点中也有重点；对于具有全国意义的“缺门”项目和具有特殊政治任务的建设项目，排队时应加以照顾，注意把收尾工程作好，保证新建企业及时投入生产。特别是为一千零七十万吨钢所需要的土高炉、小高炉以及煤炭、交通运输等基建项目，排队时必须列为重点，以便逐步地把小高炉和土高炉武装起来，保证其正常生产。
    从会议中提供的情况看出，建设项目要认真的进行严格的排队，必须做好两件工作：一是干部思想工作，二是建筑材料、施工力量由省市自治区党委集中掌握，统一调配使用。
    快速施工应成为正常施工方法
    关于快速施工问题。“分批突击、快速施工”是建筑安装企业中的一项革命，可以缩短工期，降低建筑成本。各地在快速施工方面已取得一些经验，会议认为：这种施工方法应成为我国基本建设中的正常施工方法。目前的任务是：（一）召开现场会议总结经验，作到有计划的推广；（二）逐步改革过去制定的不合适的劳动组织、工资制度、施工管理制度，以适合快速施工的需要；（三）特别重要的是要把这种方法变成广泛的群众运动，与当前建筑安装工作中的技术革新运动结合起来。
    大中小型相结合以中小型为主
    关于工业布局。由于当前农村人民公社化和工业建设大搞群众运动的新形势，要求工农业结合，以中小型为主，分散布置。从目前若干省市的工业布局情况来看，在某些旧有大中城市安排的企业多了一些，有些企业规模大了一些，结果使城市的规模迅速扩大起来。会议认为，合理解决工业布局问题，当前应注意如下三个问题：（一）必须坚持贯彻中央提出的“大中小型相结合，以中小型为主”的方针。当然，大工厂是工业中的骨干，从全国来说，建设一些大工厂是必需的，但中小工厂应该是主要的，并在产品数量上占多数。
      （二）会议认为要继续批判工业企业过于集中的思想。建设项目的布置，应力求分散，避免过分集中。为了加快建设速度，大城市原有工厂作某些扩建或新建是必要的，但不应过分集中。应该把更多的工厂放到中小城市去建设，这不仅在目前有其重要意义，从长远来说，意义更为重大，对于实现工农业结合，消灭城乡差别，过渡到共产主义，分散建设可以作到大快、大省。
      （三）会议认为，建立全国和地区的工业体系要有步骤，首先是全国，其次是在各个协作区建立比较完整的工业体系，如果目前每个省、自治区都要搞一个工业体系，结果，材料设备都分散了，势必影响全国和协作区的建设进度。有了全国的工业体系，对协作区的工业建设就有了保证，建立了协作区的工业体系，各省的工业建设就有了保证。所以，在建立工业体系问题上，必须注意克服各地区不分轻重缓急，不分建设先后和什么都要建设的倾向。
    “土洋结合”的设计  方法需要普遍推行
    关于设计工作问题。会议认为：设计工作是建设中能否多快好省的一个关键问题。几年来设计工作的成绩是很大的，设计赶不上施工的局面已经基本上解决，设计技术水平也有很大的提高，但是按形势的需要，设计工作的进步还是不够的，而且各设计部门的进步是不平衡的。这主要表现在执行多快好省的方针上土建设计比工艺设计的进步显著；“土洋结合”的办法，在设计中还未能得到认真的、普遍的推行。会议认为，“土洋结合”应当成为我国基本建设中大量地普遍地采用的设计方法，不如此，就不能多快好省。当然，在尖端工业部门和少数工厂还需要采用最新的技术；不然，我国的技术水平就不能提高。由于第二个五年计划的主要项目在最近半年内将要大部分上马，因此设计问题是近半年内带有决定性的问题，这些项目的设计是否符合多快好省的方针，上马后再审查就来不及了。必须组织力量对现有设计进行一次审查，各省（市）自治区和中央各有关部门都应认真地把设计工作抓一下。
    配套设备的制造  主要靠自力更生
    关于配套设备的制造问题。由于明年全国机械配套设备的需要量很大，而明年全国机械制造工业的任务又都很重，因此，配套设备的供应就发生了问题，会议认为，这是一项极关重要的问题，必须及早进行统一安排。由于机械设备的种类繁多，而且每一种机械设备又是由很多部件和零件组合起来的，如何组织各种设备的配套生产，是一项十分复杂和繁重的任务。在全国机械制造工业任务十分繁重的情况下，配套制造应该主要靠自力更生和通过协作来解决。各省市都应当组织配套公司，在党政领导下，组织配套工作。第一机械工业部也要大力领导这一工作。各地还必须挤出一部分生产力量，统一安排配套的制造任务。
    1958年的基本建设工作，约有三分之一左右的工作量要在今后两个月内完成，同时明年大规模的基本建设也必须在今年冬天作好明春的施工准备，会议认为各地在进行冬季施工的同时，对于明年施工需要的地方建筑材料如砖、瓦、砂、石等，一定要提早进行生产准备，生产这些材料需要的劳动力和运输力，应该与农业生产、炼钢、炼铁以及其他方面的需要进行统一安排。建筑安装力量不足的地区，根据需要除了原有施工力量比较强的省市，抽调一部分力量支援力量较薄弱的地区外；各地区都应以自力更生的办法进行培养。
    加强党的领导  彻底走群众路线
    上述各项工作的完成，都需要加强当地党委的领导，进行广泛的群众运动才能办到。无论是项目排队，工业合理布局，或是审查设计，推广快速施工等，如果没有党委的领导，不去发动群众，都是搞不好的。基本建设中许多重大问题，只有在党的领导下，充分发动群众，真正作到思想交锋，克服保守思想，才能达到多快好省的目的。因此，会议认为加强党的领导和开展群众运动是完成明年基本建设巨大任务的基本保证。建议各省（市）自治区党委书记像抓工业生产一样领导基本建设工作，在基本建设任务大于工业生产任务的地区，要以更多的精力领导基本建设工作，并且在基本建设工作中要放手发动群众，彻底走群众路线，把任务、理由和方法向群众讲得清清楚楚，在群众中展开辩论，发动广大群众的积极性，为在基本建设战线上争取辉煌的胜利而奋斗。（附图片）
