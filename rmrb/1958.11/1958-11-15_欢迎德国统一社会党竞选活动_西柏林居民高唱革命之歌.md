Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 14th. Albert Norden, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, said in West Berlin on the evening of the 13th that Khrushchev's proposal, Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, once again expressed the wishes of the German people. The abnormal situation in Berlin is mainly caused by the spy organizations fostered by the US dollar, which create division between the people of Berlin and between the people of Germany.

Norden made these remarks when he delivered a speech on the normalization of relations in Berlin at an election rally in West Berlin. The conference was convened by the Greater Berlin District Committee, and was attended by approximately 8,400 people.

West Berlin will hold municipal council elections on December 6th. The Christian Democratic Union organization here has been sabotaging the election campaign of the German Socialist Unity Party. They hired people to tear down the election slogans and posters of the German Socialist Unity Party in West Berlin. At the election rally on the evening of the 13th, a small group of hooligans attempted to disrupt the meeting, but the workers who attended the meeting unanimously booed them on the spot. This small group of hooligans had no choice but to quietly withdraw from the venue under the united action of the masses. Later, West German police surrounded the venue, but the election rally hosted by the German Socialist Unity Party continued in an orderly manner. Some Western reporters spread rumors that the participants in this mass rally were residents of the Berlin Democratic District. However, at the request of the chairman, the audience raised their ID cards to prove that they were all residents of West Berlin.

Norden said to the masses participating in the election rally: In 1933, Thälmann spoke to the workers in this stadium. Ten years later, Goebbels, one of the fascist leaders, demanded total war here. Now the German Socialist Unity Party is proposing comprehensive peace here. His words won warm applause from the workers present.

At the meeting, the workers sang the "Liebknecht-Luxemburg Song" of 1918. This was the first time in twenty-five years that West Berlin residents sang revolutionary songs at a mass rally.

    欢迎德国统一社会党竞选活动
    西柏林居民高唱革命之歌
    新华社柏林14日电　德国统一社会党中央政治局委员、中央书记阿伯特·诺登13日晚在西柏林说：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫的建议再次表达了德国人民的愿望。柏林不正常的局势主要是受美元豢养的特务组织在柏林人民之间、在德国人民之间制造出来的。
    诺登是在西柏林的竞选大会上发表关于柏林关系正常化的演说时说这番话的。大会由大柏林专区委员会召开，出席的约有八千四百人。
    西柏林将在12月6日举行市议会选举。这里的基督教民主联盟组织对德国统一社会党的竞选一直加以破坏。它们雇人撕毁了德国统一社会党在西柏林的竞选标语和招贴画。13日晚的竞选大会上又有一小撮流氓分子企图破坏会场秩序，但参加集会的工人当场一致对他们发出嘘声。这一小撮流氓分子只好在群众的一致行动下悄悄地退出会场。后来，西德警察包围了会场，德国统一社会党主持的竞选大会仍然秩序井然地进行。有西方记者造谣说：参加这次群众集会的都是柏林民主区的居民。但是到会的听众在主席要求下，举起身份证来证明他们都是西柏林的居民。
    诺登对参加竞选大会的群众说：1933年台尔曼曾经在这个体育馆对工人讲过话。十年以后法西斯头子之一戈培尔在这里要求总体战。现在德国统一社会党又在这里提出全面和平。他的话赢得了到会工人的热烈掌声。
    会上，工人们唱起了1918年的“李卜克内西——卢森堡之歌”。西柏林居民二十五年来在群众集会上唱革命歌曲，这还是第一次。
