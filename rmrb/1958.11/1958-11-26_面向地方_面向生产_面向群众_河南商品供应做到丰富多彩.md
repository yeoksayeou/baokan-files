Facing the Locality, Facing Production, Facing the Masses
Henan's Commodity Supply Achieves Rich Variety
(Our Report) In the commercial departments of various parts of Henan Province, there are two different approaches to how to meet the needs of farmers for means of production and livelihood after they sell their products, and how to organize procurement: one approach is the "reaching-out faction" with eyes looking upwards and hands reaching outwards, who simply wait for allocation from higher authorities and support from other provinces; the other approach is to face the locality, face production, and face the masses, taking two legs.
Under the guidance of the policy of "facing the locality, facing production, and facing the masses," commercial departments in Henan Province not only sign processing and ordering contracts with people's communes, but also jointly run factories or run their own factories with people's communes; the goods produced include not only various equipment needed for iron and steel bases and water conservancy construction, but also various agricultural machinery, ball bearings, and department stores such as clothing, shoes, socks, and cultural supplies. Basically, they have achieved the requirement of "rich and varied, with everything that should be there." For example, with the help of commercial departments, people's communes in many counties of Kaifeng Prefecture have established local pesticide and local fertilizer factories. According to incomplete statistics, the entire prefecture has built 1,415 local pesticide factories and 9,301 local fertilizer factories. In order to solve the shortage of oil supply, commercial departments in Xinyang Prefecture produce a large amount of alcohol to replace oil as fuel for machines. In the fourth quarter of this year, they will be able to produce 5,120 tons of alcohol, achieving self-sufficiency in alcohol for the entire prefecture. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient supply of goods, the Tanghe County Commercial Bureau, in accordance with business needs and adhering to the principle of simplicity and combining indigenous and foreign methods, with the approval of the Party committee, established 612 factories. As of the end of August, the total value of various commodities produced reached 910,000 yuan.
From the current situation, the Henan Province commercial departments' adoption of the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, walking on two legs, facing the locality, facing production, facing the masses, and relying on self-reliance in organizing sources of goods has achieved the following results: (1) Making up for the insufficient commodity production of large factories and large cities, reducing the burden of allocating goods from higher-level commercial institutions, and easing the tense supply and demand situation; (2) More suitable for the needs of local people in terms of variety; (3) More timely in terms of time, without the difficulties of long-distance allocation and transportation, and costs are also reduced; (4) Further promote the development of local industry and accelerate rural industrialization.

### 面向地方　面向生产　面向群众  河南商品供应做到丰富多彩

    面向地方　面向生产　面向群众
    河南商品供应做到丰富多彩
    本报讯　在河南省各地商业部门中间，在如何满足农民出售产品后对生产、生活资料的需要，组织进货方面有两种不同的作法：一种作法是两眼向上、两手向外的“伸手派”，他们单纯坐等上级调拨和外省支援；一种作法是面向地方、面向生产、面向群众，用两条腿走路。
    在“面向地方、面向生产、面向群众”的方针指导下，河南省各商业部门不仅和人民公社签订加工订货合同，还和人民公社合办工厂或自办工厂；生产的商品不仅有钢铁基地和水利建设需要的各种器材，而且还有各种农业机械、滚珠轴承以及服装、鞋袜等百货、文化用品。基本上达到“丰富多彩，应有尽有”的要求。例如在商业部门帮助下，开封专区有许多县的人民公社建立了土农药和土化肥厂。据不完全统计，全专区已建成土农药厂一千四百一十五个，土化肥厂九千三百零一个。为解决石油供应不足，信阳专区商业部门大量制造酒精来代替石油作机器的燃料。今年第四季度即可生产酒精五千一百二十吨，做到全专区的酒精自给自足。唐河县商业局为解决货源不足的困难，根据业务需要，本着因陋就简、土洋并举的方针，经党委同意后，自办工厂六百一十二个。截至8月底，生产各种商品总值达九十一万元。
    从当前情况看来，河南省商业部门在组织货源方面采用土洋结合、两条腿走路，面向地方、面向生产、面向群众自力更生的方针已经收到以下几点效果：（1）弥补大工厂大城市商品生产不足，减轻上级商业机构调拨货物的负担，缓和了供求紧张的局面；（2）在花色品种方面更能适合当地群众的需要；（3）在时间上更为及时，没有远途调拨运输的困难，成本也随着降低；（4）进一步促进地方工业的发展，加速了农村工业化。
