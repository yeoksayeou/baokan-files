The Most Insatiable Thing on Earth
Peruvian Magazine "1958" Condemns US Investment as Economic Aggression

(Reported by this newspaper) The Peruvian magazine "1958" recently published an article condemning the brutal plunder of colonial and semi-colonial countries by US monopoly capital. The magazine stated, "US imperialism is the most insatiable thing on earth."

The magazine exposed the essence of US "aid" and investment in Latin America as nothing more than aggression. The magazine wrote that US investment in Chile "humiliates the country," and "aid to Peru is a noose strangling Peruvian producers." For every dollar the US gives us, "we have to repay two dollars."

The magazine quoted figures on US investment from a booklet issued by the US Embassy in Peru: 76% of foreign long-term investment and 93% of short-term investment in Peru belong to the United States. "Oil belongs to Americans, and copper mines and most textile factories are also controlled by Americans. The US has a monopoly on buying and selling cotton and a monopoly on exporting coffee, zinc, and lead. The US controls air transport, imports of machinery, and so on."

The "1958" magazine also published an article on October 20 sharply criticizing the conspiracies of the US "International Petroleum Company" in Peru. The article revealed that the leaders of this US oil trust's "Standard Oil of New Jersey" subsidiary "create unstable situations in Peru, lay off large numbers of workers, and do not produce the petroleum products needed by the people." According to magazine materials, the company laid off 1,500 workers and staff. The magazine further wrote that "International Petroleum Corporation" has consistently cruelly exploited the working people. Workers who have worked honestly for the company for thirty years are only entitled to a severance payment of one hundred and twenty soles (Peruvian currency, approximately five US dollars). "This kind of severance payment is really going to starve the workers to death." The article emphasized that the violence of feudal financial oligarchs and foreign capital "has turned Peru into a colony of the United States."

    地球上最贪得无厌的东西
    秘鲁“1958年”杂志谴责美国投资实为经济侵略
    本报讯　秘鲁“1958年”杂志在最近发表文章，谴责美国垄断资本对殖民地半殖民地国家的残酷掠夺。这家杂志说：“美帝国主义是地球上最贪得无厌的东西”。
    杂志揭穿美国对拉丁美洲“援助”和投资的实质不外是侵略。杂志写道，美国对智利的投资“使这个国家屈膝受辱”，“对秘鲁的援助是勒死秘鲁生产者的绞索”。美国给我们一个美元，“我们就得偿付两个美元”。
    杂志摘引了美国驻秘鲁大使馆一本小册子所列举的美国投资数字：在秘鲁的76％的外国长期投资和93％的短期投资属于美国。“石油属于美国人，铜矿和大部分纺织厂也操纵在美国人手里。美国有购买和出售棉花的垄断权，有输出咖啡、锌和铅的垄断权。美国控制着空运、输入机器等等”。
    “1958年”杂志在10月20日的一期中还刊登了一篇尖锐抨击美国“国际石油股份有限公司”在秘鲁阴谋活动的文章。文章揭露了这家美国石油托辣斯“新泽西美孚油公司”的女儿公司的领导人“在秘鲁制造不稳定的局势，大量解雇工人，不生产人民所必需的石油产品”。根据杂志材料，这家公司解雇了一千五百名工人和职员。杂志进一步写道，“国际石油股份有限公司”一贯残酷地剥削劳动人民。在公司老老实实地工作了三十年的工人，规定只能领到一百二十索尔（秘币，约合五美元）的优抚金。“这种优抚金真是要使工人饿死。”文章着重指出，封建金融寡头和外国资本的暴力“已使秘鲁变成了美国的殖民地”。
