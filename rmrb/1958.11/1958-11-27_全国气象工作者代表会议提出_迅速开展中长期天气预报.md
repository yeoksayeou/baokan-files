National Meteorological Workers' Representative Conference Proposes Rapid Development of Medium and Long-Range Weather Forecasting

(Our Dispatch) The Central Meteorological Bureau recently convened a National Meteorological Workers' Representative Conference in Lanzhou. The conference focused on discussing how to rapidly and widely develop medium and long-range weather forecasting and studied the analysis methods for the plateau region.

This conference exposed and criticized various erroneous ideologies in meteorological work, such as blindly believing in foreign countries and experts, valuing foreign methods while slighting local methods, and advocating special cases. For example, some people believed that since medium and long-range weather forecasting had not been well resolved in other countries, China could not possibly produce any results either. Some people believed that the urgent need for medium and long-range weather forecasting in current industrial, agricultural production, and national defense was an unsolvable contradiction in meteorological service work. After criticizing the above erroneous ideas and initially breaking down superstitions, everyone agreed that just as short-term weather forecasts (within 48 hours) can be done well, medium-term (three to five days) and long-term weather forecasts (ten days to over a month) can also be done well. The conference discussed 56 summary research reports on medium and long-range weather forecasting and plateau weather analysis methods. Among the 35 summary research reports on medium and long-range weather forecasting methods, some used indigenous methods, some used foreign methods, and some combined indigenous and foreign methods. Some reports studied forecasting using weather maps combined with the experience of the working people. Some research reports were written by people who had never received meteorological training in three or four months; some reports were written by weather observers who were previously considered incapable of making weather forecasts. Both of these reports had certain practical value and were praised by the participating representatives and experts. Regarding the analysis and forecasting of plateau weather, many practical methods were also proposed at the conference, initially revealing the secrets of plateau weather. These research reports greatly inspired the attending representatives, who unanimously stated that medium and long-range weather forecasting is not unattainable, and the key lies in putting politics in command, liberating thinking, and breaking down superstitions.

At the conference, the Southwest and Northwest cooperation zones decided to work together to vigorously tackle plateau weather. The Shanghai Central Meteorological Observatory proposed to solve the medium and long-range forecasting of Pacific typhoons and subtropical high pressure systems. Representatives from Yunnan Province stated that they would complete 900 summary research reports before the Spring Festival and rapidly carry out medium and long-range weather forecasting service work throughout the province using the "small indigenous groups" approach.

Lu Yu, Deputy Director of the Central Meteorological Bureau, spoke at the meeting, saying that to develop medium and long-range weather forecasting, it is first necessary to put politics in command, liberate thinking, break down superstitions, and continuously carry out the struggle between two roads in the field of meteorological science; second, it is necessary to combine indigenous and foreign methods, combine short, medium, and long-term forecasting, combine large, medium, and small-scale efforts, and do everything possible to provide good service, constantly creating new methods in practice; and finally, it is necessary to start from the needs of production, plan comprehensively, cooperate with each other, and rely on the masses to vigorously carry out technical revolution.

    全国气象工作者代表会议提出
    迅速开展中长期天气预报
    本报讯　中央气象局最近在兰州召开了全国气象工作者代表会议。会议着重讨论了如何迅速广泛开展中长期天气预报，研究了高原分析方法问题。
    这次会议揭发和批判了在气象工作中迷信外国、迷信专家、重洋轻土、特殊论等形形色色的错误思想。如有人认为：中长期天气预报在世界各国还没有很好解决，因此中国也就不可能研究出什么结果。有些人认为当前工农业生产和国防等方面迫切需要中长期天气预报，是气象服务工作中难以解决的矛盾。在批判了以上各种错误思想，初步破除迷信的基础上，大家认为短期天气预报（四十八小时内）能做好，中长期天气预报（三至五天）和长期天气预报（十天到一月以上）也能做好。会上讨论了有关中长期天气预报和高原天气分析方法的总结研究报告五十六篇。在三十五篇中长期天气预报方法的总结研究报告中，有土法，有洋法，有土洋结合，有的报告研究了利用天气图结合劳动人民的经验进行预报。有的研究报告是从来没有受过气象训练的人在三、四个月中写出来的；有的报告是由过去被认为不能做天气预报的天气观测员写的。这两篇报告都具有一定的实用价值，受到与会代表和专家的赞扬。关于高原天气的分析和预报，会上也提出了许多实用的方法，初步揭开了高原天气的秘密。这些研究报告使到会代表受到很大的启发，一致表示中长期天气预报不是高不可攀的，关键在于政治挂帅，解放思想，破除迷信。
    会上西南、西北两协作区决定通力合作，猛攻高原天气。上海中心气象台提出要解决太平洋台风和副热带高压的中长期预报。云南省代表表示在春节前完成总结研究报告九百篇，以“小土群”的方针迅速在全省普遍开展中长期天气预报服务工作。
    中央气象局副局长卢鋈在会上讲了话，他说，开展中长期天气预报，首先要政治挂帅，解放思想，破除迷信，不断地开展气象科学领域里两条道路的斗争；其次必须土洋结合，短中长期结合，大中小结合，千方百计做好服务工作，在实践中不断创造新的方法；最后要从生产需要出发，全面规划，互相协作，依靠群众大闹技术革命。
