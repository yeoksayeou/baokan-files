Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 7th: The Nobusuke Kishi government's "Defense Agency" held a summit meeting in Tokyo on the afternoon of the 6th to discuss the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty." According to a Kyodo News report, the heads of the "Defense Agency" incredibly believed that "Even if the (US-Japan) joint defense area (i.e., the area to which the treaty applies) includes Okinawa and Ogasawara, the Self-Defense Forces' dispatch (to the aforementioned areas) would not violate the constitution." They also stated that the ongoing negotiations regarding the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" will proceed according to this "interpretation" from now on.

Those who participated in the meeting included Hisashi Imai, Administrative Vice-Minister of the "Defense Agency," Muneo Nagato, Director-General of the Secretariat, Yoji Kato, Director-General of the "Defense Bureau," and Keizo Hayashi, Chairman of the Joint Staff Council. They argued that Japan has "latent sovereignty" over Okinawa and Ogasawara, which are under US occupation, and therefore including these areas in the so-called "joint defense area" does not violate the constitution. They also believe that Japan "conceptually" possesses "inherent rights of self-defense" over these areas, and even if the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" were "hypothetically" dispatched to these areas, it would not be considered sending troops abroad. The Nobusuke Kishi government's eagerness to participate in the US's military aggression plans in the Far East, in order to accelerate the realization of Japanese militarism's expansionist ambitions, has been further exposed.

According to Kyodo News, the "Defense Agency" expressed its attitude on the "joint defense area" issue because there was an impression that "the Defense Agency is taking a passive attitude towards this issue." Because the Japanese people resolutely oppose the Nobusuke Kishi government's policy of leading Japan onto the path of war, the Nobusuke Kishi government, while actually supporting the expansion of the US-Japan "joint defense area" to the Western Pacific, has always been afraid to explicitly admit this to the Japanese people. Now that the negotiations on revising the US-Japan "Security Treaty" have reached a stage where it is necessary to lift the veil, officials from the "Defense Agency" have publicly revealed the Nobusuke Kishi government's true intentions in order to please the United States.

### 岸信介政府侵略野心毕露  要把冲绳小笠原划入日美“共同防御地区”

    岸信介政府侵略野心毕露
    要把冲绳小笠原划入日美“共同防御地区”
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：岸信介政府“防卫厅”6日下午在东京举行了首脑会议，讨论修改日美“安全条约”问题。据共同社报道，“防卫厅”的首脑们竟然认为：“即使（日美）共同防御地区（即适用条约地区）包括冲绳和小笠原，自卫队出动（到上述地区去），也不违反宪法。”他们并且表示，正在进行中的关于修改日美“安全条约”的谈判，今后将按照这一“解释”来进行。
    参加这次会议的有“防卫厅”事务次官今井久、官房长门叶宗雄、“防卫局”局长加藤阳二和幕僚长联席会议议长林敬三等。他们借口日本对在美国占领下的冲绳和小笠原拥有“潜在主权”，因此把这些地区划进所谓“共同防御地区”并不违反宪法。他们还认为，在“概念上”日本对这些地区拥有“固有的自卫权”，即使“假定”日本“自卫队”出动到这些地区去，也不算是派兵出国。岸信介政府急于参加美国在远东的军事侵略计划，以便加紧实现日本军国主义的侵略野心，至此进一步暴露出来。
    据共同社透露，“防卫厅”这一次所以要对“共同防御地区”问题表示态度，是因为有人有这样的印象：“防卫厅对这个问题采取消极的态度”。由于日本人民坚决反对岸信介政府所奉行的把日本推上战争的道路的政策，岸信介政府虽然实际上赞成把美日“共同防御地区”扩大到西太平洋，但是，他始终不敢向日本人民明确承认这一点。现在，修改日美“安全条约”的谈判已经到了非揭开遮羞布不可的阶段了，于是由“防卫厅”的官员们来公开透露岸信介政府的真实意图，以取得美国的欢心。
