Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 2nd November: The wave of protests from Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots against American imperialism's occupation of Taiwan has spread to all levels of society. According to incomplete statistics, at least 300,000 Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots have participated in protest rallies, accusation meetings, symposiums, issuing joint statements, and signing petitions to denounce the American imperialists' crimes of aggression.

From the beginning of September to the present, Hong Kong and Kowloon workers, farmers, teachers, students, industrialists, businessmen, film workers, publishing circles, and religious figures have held thousands of meetings and symposiums, expressing their full support for the motherland's struggle to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu. Over the past two months, letters from all walks of life protesting against American aggression have flooded into newspaper editorial offices. Workers and students have also extensively launched signature campaigns against American aggression in Taiwan.

The anti-American grand performance held by Hong Kong and Kowloon workers in mid-October sparked an anti-American patriotic upsurge among workers in all industries. Influenced and driven by the workers, Hong Kong writers, artists, and many teachers and students have taken up their pens and published more than 200 literary works in newspapers over the past month, opposing American aggression and the atrocities committed by Americans in Hong Kong. These works, including essays, novels, poems, plays, operas, and cartoons, all reflect the Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots' hatred of American imperialists.

    港九同胞反美爱国情绪激昂
    纷纷采取行动声讨美国侵略者
    新华社香港2日电　港九同胞反对美帝国主义侵占台湾的抗议声浪，已遍及各个阶层。据不完全的统计，港九同胞最少有三十万人参加了抗议集会、控诉会、座谈会，发表联合声明和签名等，声讨美帝国主义的侵略罪行。
    从9月初到现在，港九工人、农民、教师、学生、工商业者、电影工作者、出版界和宗教界人士，举行了数以千计的集会和座谈会，表示全力支持祖国解放台、澎、金、马的斗争。各阶层抗议美国侵略罪行的信件，两个月来不断涌到报馆的编辑部。工人和学生更广泛地开展反对美国侵略台湾的签名运动。
    港九工人在10月中旬举行的反美大会演，在各业工人中掀起了一个反美爱国的高潮。在工人们的影响带动下，香港的作家、艺术工作者和许多教师、学生都拿起笔杆，一个多月来在报纸上发表了二百多篇以反对美国侵略和美国人在香港制造暴行的文艺作品。这些作品包括杂文、小说、诗歌、剧本、曲艺、漫画等，都反映了港九同胞对美帝国主义者的憎恨。
