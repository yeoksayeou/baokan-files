Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 16th. The National Academic Conference on Parasitic Diseases held by the Chinese Medical Association in Shanghai concluded on the 15th. After three days of preparatory meetings focusing on ideological understanding, and five days of conference for reading papers and discussions, the conference further clarified the understanding that medical science must be led by politics, scientific research must follow the mass line, and determined the direction and planning of future prevention and research work. The conference also adopted the fighting goal of "Going all out, aiming high, achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and dedicating to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the country by basically eliminating schistosomiasis, malaria, filariasis, kala-azar, and hookworm disease."

In the past nine years, under the leadership of the Party, China's parasitic disease prevention and control work has implemented the policy of combining the masses and technical personnel, and has achieved great achievements. To date, schistosomiasis, which has been prevalent in twelve provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions for nearly a hundred years, has been basically eliminated in more than half of the epidemic areas. The number of malaria cases, which was estimated to be about 30 million people per year before liberation, has now been reduced to 2.6% of that estimate. Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, located in the subtropics, has always been known as the "malarial region" and is a famous "ultra-high malaria epidemic area" both in China and abroad, but malaria has now been basically eliminated. The number of people treated for filariasis in various places has reached 700,000, of which the number of treatments in 1958 is equal to sixteen times the total number of treatments in the past eight years. Kala-azar, which mainly prevailed in 98 counties and cities in five provinces north of the Yangtze River, has been basically eliminated and will be completely eliminated next year. In addition, 23 counties and cities including Shanghai have basically eliminated hookworm disease. The tragic situation of "villages deserted, people dying, and ghosts singing in every household" before liberation has been changed.

At the preparatory meeting, representatives from 27 provinces (regions) and cities also severely criticized the ideological style of some bourgeois experts who did not believe in the leadership of the Party, were divorced from practice in prevention and control work, and neglected the masses and pursued personal fame and gain; and summarized and exchanged the important experiences of various places in basically eliminating parasitic diseases. The representatives unanimously believed that academic research must be politically led, and the direction of future investigation and research should start from the health of 600 million people, from promoting socialist construction, closely integrate with production, and serve production; to realize the elimination of the five major parasitic diseases, it is necessary to give full play to the spirit of communist cooperation and accelerate the resolution of key and cutting-edge problems. In schistosomiasis prevention and control, how to eliminate Oncomelania snails in lake and swamp areas, traditional Chinese medicine prevention and treatment methods, rapid elimination of schistosome eggs in feces, and how to treat schistosomiasis in draught cattle are considered as cutting-edge research topics. In the treatment of malaria, filariasis, and kala-azar, the radical cure of tertian malaria, the treatment of late filariasis, and the treatment of kala-azar patients resistant to antimony were identified as key research topics. The meeting also emphasized that in the treatment and research of the five major parasitic diseases, it is necessary to carry forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine and explore the valuable experience of traditional Chinese medicine to find more thorough and effective treatment methods. The meeting also discussed and formulated more practical assessment standards for the basic elimination of the five major parasitic diseases.

The conference invited delegations of parasitology experts from the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Vietnam, and North Korea to participate. Experts from various countries delivered rich and colorful academic papers at the conference and exchanged experiences with the representatives attending the meeting.

    全国寄生虫病学术会议提出
    明年基本消灭五大寄生虫病
    新华社上海16日电　中华医学会在上海举行的全国寄生虫病学术会议15日结束。这次会议经过三天的预备会议务虚，五天的会议宣读论文和讨论，进一步明确认识了医学科学必须以政治为统帅，科学研究必须走群众路线，并且确定了今后防治研究工作的方针和规划。会议还通过了“鼓足干劲、全面跃进，为基本消灭血吸虫病、疟疾、丝虫病、黑热病、钩虫病等寄生虫病，向建国十周年献礼”的奋斗目标。
    九年来，我国的寄生虫病防治工作在党的领导下，实行群众和技术人员相结合的方针，已取得很大成就，到目前止，全国十二个省市、自治区流行近百年的血吸虫病，已在半数以上的流行区基本消灭。解放前估计每年发病人数达三千万人左右的疟疾病，现在已降低到这个估计数目的2，6％。处在亚热带的云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州，历来被称为“瘴疟地区”，是中外著名的“超高疟疾流行区”，现已基本消灭疟疾。各地丝虫病治疗人数已达七十万人，其中1958年的治疗数字等于过去八年治疗总数的十六倍。主要流行在长江以北五省九十八个县市的黑热病已基本消灭，明年就能把它完全消灭。此外，上海等二十三个县市已基本消灭了钩虫病。解放以前的“千村薜苈人遗矢，万户萧疏鬼唱歌”的悲惨局面已经改变。
    来自二十七省（区）市的代表们在预备会上，还对一些资产阶级专家不相信党的领导，在防治工作上脱离实践，轻视群众，追求个人名利的思想作风作了严格的批判；总结和交流了各地基本消灭寄生虫病的重要经验。代表们一致认为学术研究必须政治挂帅，今后调查研究的方向，应从六亿人民的健康，从促进社会主义建设出发，密切结合生产，为生产服务；实现消灭五大寄生虫病必须发挥共产主义大协作的精神，加速解决关键性与尖端性的问题。在血吸虫病防治方面，以如何消灭湖沼地区钉螺、中医中药防治方法、快速消灭粪便中血吸虫卵与如何治疗耕牛血吸虫病等为尖端性研究课题。在疟疾、丝虫病、黑热病的治疗方面，分别以间日疟的根治、晚期丝虫病的治疗，以及黑热病抗锑病人的治疗为关键性研究课题。会议并且强调指出，在五大寄生虫病的治疗研究上必须发扬祖国医学遗产，发掘中医中药的宝贵经验，找出更彻底有效的治疗方法。会议还讨论制定了较为切合实际的基本消灭五大寄生虫病的考核标准。
    这次会议邀请了苏联、德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、越南、朝鲜等国家的寄生虫病学专家代表团参加。各国的专家都在大会上宣读了丰富多采的学术论文，并和出席会议的代表们交流了经验。
