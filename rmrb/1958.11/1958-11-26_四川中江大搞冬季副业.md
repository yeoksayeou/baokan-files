Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, November 24th: Zhongjiang County, Sichuan Province, is developing diversified economic activities and has identified 77 business projects in just over twenty days.

In order to increase the income of commune members in many ways, the Zhongjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the requirement to develop diversified economic activities to the people's communes in early November, which was warmly supported by the masses. However, some people felt that there were few methods and that the income was sporadic, which would not solve the problem much. There were also some other ideological concerns. To this end, the County Committee put forward the slogan of "Do it in the house, find it in the mountains, dig it underground, and fish it in the water; everyone finds a way, and everyone digs for treasure." The communes also held meetings to mobilize everyone to debate and offer suggestions. In this way, not only were ideological concerns quickly eliminated, but the masses also put forward many new projects in light of local conditions, from raising cattle and pigs to brewing wine, making bricks, tiles, and cement, from vegetables to medicinal materials, fruits, and fishing and transportation, etc., the content is very rich.

From the county to the commune, Party committees at all levels now have special personnel in charge of diversified economic activities. According to the needs and the specialties of the commune members, various professional teams have been generally established in each commune, first focusing on the management of some projects that can take effect immediately. In November, various sideline businesses in the county's communes can generate a total income of more than 600,000 yuan. Many communes have therefore been able to pay wages to their members in a timely manner.

    四川中江大搞冬季副业
    新华社成都24日电　四川省中江县发展多种经济，在二十多天内找到了七十七项经营项目。
    为了多方增加社员收入，中共中江县委在11月初向全县人民公社提出发展多种经济的要求，受到群众热烈拥护。但有些人感到办法少，收入零星，解决问题不大。另外也还有其他一些思想顾虑。为此，县委提出了“屋里做，山上找，地下挖，水里捞；个个找门路，人人挖财宝”的口号，各公社也召开会议，发动大家辩论和献计。这样，不但迅速消除了思想顾虑，而且群众因地制宜，提出了许多新的项目，从养牛、养猪到酿酒、制砖瓦、水泥，从蔬菜到药材、水果以及捕鱼、运输等等，内容十分丰富。
    从县到公社，现在各级党委都有专人负责搞多种经济。根据需要和社员特长，各公社普遍建立各种专业队，首先抓紧马上能见效的一些项目经营。11月份，全县各公社各种副业，共可收入六十多万元。许多公社都因此及时向社员发放了工资。
