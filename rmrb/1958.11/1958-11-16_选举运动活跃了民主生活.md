    Election Campaign Activates Democratic Life
    By Our Correspondent Yang Xiaoqi
    Hungary will hold elections for the National Assembly and local councils on November 16. For more than a month, workers, peasants, and intellectuals across the country have been actively and enthusiastically preparing to welcome this general election. From factories to rural areas, from cities to remote regions, a lively and jubilant political atmosphere prevails everywhere. Many people have volunteered to participate in election propaganda work. In Bács-Kiskun County alone, more than 30 people have gone into households to conduct visits and propaganda. Of the 318,000 propagandists nationwide, 40% are non-Party members.

    The propaganda machine of the Western bourgeoisie has tried every means to belittle the significance of this election in Hungary, constantly spreading rumors and slanders that Hungary has no democracy, and trying to instigate the Hungarian people to adopt a passive attitude in the election campaign. But the fact is, just as the Hungarian people resolutely chose the socialist road in the October counter-revolutionary incident, in this election campaign the Hungarian people have given them another resounding slap in the face. Not only Party members, workers, and peasants, but also intellectuals have actively participated in the election campaign. Some primary school teachers in rural areas, who had a negative attitude towards the people's democratic system after the counter-revolutionary incident, are now actively involved. They are helping the election committees to carry out propaganda and mobilization and taking the lead in participating in various meetings. From October 2 to 22, 3.5 million people across the country participated in more than 100,000 large and small meetings to deliberate and discuss the nomination of candidates. Such broad mass support for the election is unprecedented in Hungarian history.

    Taking the socialist road is the desire of every Hungarian, so every citizen is trying to elect the person who is most loyal to the socialist system, best represents the interests of the Hungarian people, and is most respected as their representative. This has been fully demonstrated at the candidate nomination meetings. At the candidate nomination meetings, 15,000 people spoke in Budapest alone. In Bács-Kiskun County, 2,000 people spoke. In many meetings, voters spent hours determining whether someone could be their candidate. Everyone cherished their democratic rights and actively expressed their opinions, forming a mass movement to examine candidates. All candidates are recommended by the Patriotic People's Front, and the vast majority of them are supported by the masses. However, there were also individual cases of inappropriate nominations that were rejected by the masses. For example, in the eighth district of the capital, during the discussion of candidates for the district council, some individuals who had not performed well in the counter-revolutionary incident or whose personal moral character was poor were exposed by the masses and rejected.

    Kádár and his comrades Münnich, Marosán, Apró, and other Party and government leaders, as well as President Dobi, who has been cooperating with the Party and firmly following the socialist road, have all been nominated as candidates for the National Assembly. This is quite natural; every Hungarian knows them. It was they who stood up in the Hungarian counter-revolutionary incident, at a time when the country was in danger, united all patriots, extinguished the flames of counter-revolution with the assistance of the Soviet army, organized the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, reorganized the Party, consolidated the people's democratic regime, restored socialist order, restored the damaged economy, and resolutely suppressed the treasonous criminals headed by Imre Nagy. The Hungarian people understand this truth: if the counter-revolution had succeeded, the entire socialist system would have been overthrown, and Cardinal Mindszenty and the old officers, big capitalists, and big landlords of the Horthy era who had fled abroad would have once again ridden on the backs of the people.

    The nomination of the leaders of the Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government as candidates for the National Assembly also shows that the policies implemented by the Party and the government in the past two years are correct and represent the interests of the people. Therefore, the people support the Party and the government.

    In the past two years, Hungary has achieved great success in restoring and developing the national economy. In the first year after the October incident, the national economy achieved initial recovery. On this basis, the three-year plan has begun this year. According to the plan, socialist industrial production will increase by 22% in three years, agricultural production will increase by 12%-13% in the absence of special disasters, and national income will increase by 13%. This year is the first year of the three-year plan, and in the first three quarters, state-owned industries overfulfilled the plan by 3%, with an average daily output increase of 18% compared with the same period last year.

    Agricultural collectivization is also developing. In the first three quarters, a total of 284 cooperatives were added, with 181,288 hectares of land and 20,698 members. At the same time, 30 production cooperative groups were converted into cooperatives, and another 1,509 production groups and specialized teams were established. By this point, there are 3,633 cooperatives nationwide, with 173,000 members and 1,194,000 hectares of cultivated land, accounting for 12.8% of the country's cultivated land area. In the summer harvest, production cooperatives harvested an average of 180 kilograms more wheat per hectare than individual farmers. This year, although the national summer grain harvest was slightly lower than last year due to climatic influences, livestock production increased significantly compared with last year. Trade has also achieved a surplus. In nine months, the state built 8,100 houses. The people's living standards have improved compared to before the counter-revolutionary incident. Compared with 1956, national income has increased by 28.5% this year. In the past two years, people have deeply felt that the characteristics of the Party's policy are "say what you have, do what you say, be consistent in word and deed." Therefore, the people completely trust the leaders of the Party and the government.

    The composition of the candidates also fully embodies democracy. Among the 338 candidates for the National Assembly and 171 alternate representatives, 225 are workers, peasants, and leading cadres of worker and peasant origin. The others are scientists, engineers, writers, educators, and priests who stand with the people. They represent all strata and the entire Hungarian people. Now, let's look back at Hungarian history. Taking the composition of the so-called representatives of the National Assembly during the Horthy rule in 1931 as an example, it is a stark contrast. What was the so-called democracy at that time? At that time, among the 245 representatives of the National Assembly, there were 84 landlords, 19 counts, 46 judges and lawyers, 20 bankers and capitalists, 14 senior military officers, and 12 priests.

    In the past month, Party and government leaders, candidates for the National Assembly and local councils have met closely with 4 million voters. During the meetings, the leaders explained the Party's policies and the current situation of the country to the voters, frankly explained the difficulties that still exist, and listened to the voters' opinions to jointly explore solutions. During this period, people's political enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high. What they cared most about was no longer their personal current living interests, but the development of the country, the state, and the region. They also put forward many suggestions.

    The election campaign has also mobilized the production enthusiasm of the people across the country. Many factories organized "revolutionary classes" during this period and launched labor competitions. Farmers are actively doing a good job in autumn harvesting and planting to greet the general election with practical actions.

    选举运动活跃了民主生活
    本报记者　杨嚣基
    匈牙利在11月16日要进行国会和地方议会的选举。一个多月来，全国工人、农民和知识分子都在积极热情地准备迎接这次大选，从工厂到农村，从城市到边远地区，到处呈现出活跃欢腾的政治气氛。许多人自愿参加了选举宣传工作，仅巴契—基什孔州即有三十多人深入各家各户去进行访问和宣传。在全国三十一万八千名宣传员中，有40％是非党人士。
    西方资产阶级的宣传机器想尽一切方法贬低匈牙利这次选举的意义，不断放出谰言诬蔑说匈牙利没有民主，力图煽动匈牙利人民在选举运动中采取消极的态度。但事实正像在十月反革命事件中匈牙利人民坚决选择了社会主义道路一样，在这次选举运动中匈牙利人民又给了他们一记响亮的耳光。不但党员、工人、农民，就是知识分子也积极地参加了选举运动。有的乡村小学教员，在反革命事件后曾对人民民主制度抱有消极态度，现在也积极活跃起来了，他们帮助选举委员会进行宣传鼓动，带头参加各种会议。从10月2日至22日，全国有三百五十万人参加了酝酿讨论提候选人的大小会议十万多次，这样广泛的群众支持选举，就是在匈牙利历史中也是没有的。
    走社会主义的道路，这是每个匈牙利人的愿望，因此每个公民都极力想选出最忠实于社会主义制度、最能代表匈牙利人民利益的和自己所最敬爱的人当代表。这一点在提候选人的会议上已充分地表现出来了。在提候选人的会议上，仅在首都布达佩斯就有一万五千人发了言。在巴契—基什孔州有二千人发了言。在不少会议上选民们曾用数小时来确定某人是否可当他们的候选人，每人都十分珍视自己的民主权利，积极表示自己的意见，形成了一次群众性的审查候选人运动。所有的候选人都由爱国人民阵线推荐的，他们绝大多数是群众心里所拥护的，但也有个别提得不适当而被群众否决了。如首都第八区在讨论区议会候选人中，对个别在反革命事件中表现得不大好的或个人道德品质不良的，经群众揭发后否决了。
    卡达尔和他的战友明尼赫、马罗山、奥普罗等党政领导人以及一直与党合作坚决走社会主义道路的道比主席都被提为国会代表候选人。这是十分自然的，每个匈牙利人都了解他们。正是他们在匈牙利反革命事件中，在国家临于危难的关头挺身而出，团结了一切爱国者在苏军援助下扑灭了反革命的火焰，组织了工农革命政府和重新组织了党，巩固了人民民主政权，恢复了社会主义秩序，恢复了被破坏的经济，并坚决镇压了以纳吉·伊姆雷为首的叛国罪犯。匈牙利人民都了解这个道理：如果反革命胜利了，整个社会主义制度将会覆灭，红衣主教明曾蒂和流亡国外的霍尔蒂时代的旧军官、大资本家和大地主将重新骑在人民头上。
    社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的领导人被提名为国会候选人，这也说明了党和政府这两年来所执行的政策是正确的，是代表人民利益的，因此人民拥护党和政府。
    两年来，匈牙利在恢复和发展国民经济方面已获得了巨大的成就。在十月事件后第一年匈国民经济就获得了初步恢复，在这基础上今年又开始了三年计划，按照计划社会主义工业生产在三年内将增长22％，农业生产在无特殊灾害情况下将提高12％—13％，国民收入将增长13％。今年是执行三年计划第一年，前三季度国营工业超额完成计划3％，平均日产量比去年同期增长了18％。
    农业合作化也在发展着，在前三季共增加了二百八十四个合作社，它们有土地十八万一千二百八十八霍尔特，社员达二万零六百九十八人。同时，有三十个生产合作组改成了合作社，另建立了一千五百零九个合作组和专业小组。至此全国共有合作社三千六百三十三个社，社员十七万三千人，耕地一百一十九万四千霍尔特，占全国耕地面积的12.8％。生产合作社在夏收中，平均每霍尔特小麦比个体农民多收一百八十公斤。今年全国夏收粮食由于气候影响，虽比去年稍减，但在畜产方面却比去年增加了许多。贸易也已获得了顺差。九个月中国家建造了住宅八千一百座。人民的生活水平比反革命事件前提高了。与1956年比，今年国民收入提高了28.5％。两年来，人们深深地体会到党的政策的特点是“有什么，说什么，说到做到，言行一致”。因此，人民完全信任党和政府的领导人。
    在候选人的成分中，也充分体现了民主。在三百三十八名国会代表和一百七十一名候补代表候选人中有二百二十五名是工人、农民及工农出身的领导干部，其他则是科学家、工程师、作家、教育工作者和与人民站在一起的神父。他们代表了各阶层，同时代表了全体匈牙利人民。现在翻看一下匈牙利的历史吧，如以1931年霍尔蒂统治时代的所谓国会代表成分为例，恰是鲜明的对比，那时的所谓民主又是怎样的呢？那时在二百四十五名国会代表中有地主八十四人，伯爵十九人，法官和律师四十六人，银行家和资本家二十人，高级军官十四人，神父十二人。
    一个月来，党政领导人、国会和地方议会候选人曾与四百万选民亲密无间的会见。在会见中领导人向选民阐明了党的政策和国家当前的情况，对还存在的困难也坦率地说清楚，并倾听选民的意见，共同探讨解决的途径。在这期间，人们的政治热情空前高，他们所最关怀的已不再是个人的目前生活利益，而是国家和本州的、本区的发展，他们还提出了许多建议。
    选举运动还调动了全国人民的生产积极性，许多工厂在这期间组织了“革命班”，开展了劳动竞赛，农民们在积极地做好秋收秋耕工作，以实际行动来迎接大选。
