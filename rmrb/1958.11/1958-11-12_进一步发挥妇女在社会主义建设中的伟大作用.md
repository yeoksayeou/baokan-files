Further Bring into Play the Great Role of Women in Socialist Construction

Chen Zhengren

The broad masses of working women in our country have always possessed a tradition of diligence and bravery. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, they have continuously demonstrated their great strength and great role, whether in the long revolutionary struggle or in the current socialist construction. Facts have proven that without the full mobilization of this great force of women, who account for half of the population, the victory of our country's revolutionary struggle and the victory of socialist construction would be impossible. Thanks to the victory of the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, the masses of women in our country, like all the people, have achieved complete social liberation. They have gained equal rights with men in politics, economics, and culture. Their socialist consciousness is constantly improving, and their role in social production is constantly growing. Especially in the past year or so, under the situation of the great leap forward in socialist construction, the socialist enthusiasm of the masses of women has been unprecedentedly enhanced, and they have demonstrated their endless creative talents in all aspects. It is sufficient to estimate and value the great role of the masses of women in social production, and seriously put the women's labor force in an important position on the industrial and agricultural production fronts, which will greatly accelerate the victory of our country's socialist construction, and this is also an extremely important condition to ensure the smooth transition to communism in our society in the future.

Bring into play the Main Force Role of Women in Production

However, there are still inconsistencies in the understanding of the great role of the masses of women in socialist construction. Some people still have some wrong understandings. These wrong understandings can be summarized as: women can only undertake auxiliary labor, not main labor; can only undertake light labor, not competent for heavy labor; can only engage in simple agricultural labor, not industrial labor, especially not complex or heavy industrial labor. Some people even adopt a indifferent or passive attitude towards giving greater play to the role of women on the production front. Of course, women have certain physiological characteristics compared with men, and it is wrong to ignore these characteristics. It is absolutely necessary to give them appropriate care in production and life. However, if this characteristic is excessively exaggerated, it would be wrong. What is the actual situation? The broad masses of working women in our country have always been a huge force in production. In many areas, such as parts of Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and other regions, they have always played a part of the main role in production. After liberation, especially after agricultural cooperativization, the role of women in production has become greater day by day. In many areas where they did not directly participate in the main agricultural production labor in the past, they gradually participated. On the industrial and transportation fronts, the number of women participating in labor is also constantly increasing. Especially in the past year or so, due to the encouragement of the great leap forward situation in socialist construction, the socialist consciousness and labor enthusiasm of the masses of women have been enhanced, and the part of the main force role they have played on the production front has become increasingly prominent. In the recent magnificent iron and steel smelting movement, the masses of women are advancing shoulder to shoulder with men, and they are constantly creating miracles on the iron and steel smelting front. In Sichuan, the "March 8th" Women's Iron and Steel Camp and many "Women's Furnaces" groups appeared. The masses of women in Hunan issued such a heroic statement: "Women hold up half the sky, strive to be the first in everything." 600,000 women in the province directly participated in iron and steel smelting production. On the agricultural front, because 50 million main labor forces (including some women's labor) across the country have recently invested in the iron and steel smelting movement, many of the main labor in agricultural production have to fall on women. As the women of Yizhang County, Hunan Province, put it forward: "Men vigorously smelt iron and steel, women take over agriculture." More than 40,000 young and middle-aged women in the county set off a learning upsurge of "everyone learning technology, everyone being skilled," and 80% of the women in the county have learned basic agricultural work such as plowing and land preparation. Many women have become all-rounders, and more than 9,000 women have been rated as production experts in rice, sweet potatoes, and pig raising. According to statistics from Hunan Province at the end of September, 10.15 million women in the province worked every day, accounting for 64% of the total rural women population, more than double the number of workers in the same period in the past. Among them, 8 million participated in agricultural production, accounting for 80% of the current number of agricultural workers. It can be seen that women in Hunan Province have become the main force on the agricultural production front. In this case, although the province transferred 40% of the male labor force to engage in iron and steel, the winter plowing and sowing work is progressing at a rate of nearly one million mu per day, which is faster than in any previous year. The fact is that we can now see everywhere in the vast areas that the masses of women are increasingly playing a main role together with men, whether in deep plowing or autumn harvesting and planting, in water conservancy construction, or in transportation. These facts fully prove that the masses of women, like men, are increasingly becoming the main force in our country's socialist construction. Chairman Mao emphasized the extreme importance of mobilizing the masses of women to participate in socialist construction several times in his remarks on the book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside." He said: "In order to build a great socialist society, it is of great significance to mobilize the broad masses of women to participate in production activities." He also said: "Chinese women are a great human resource. This resource must be explored and strive to build a great socialist country." In another place, he pointed out: "All female labor should be allowed to participate in the labor front under the principle of equal pay for equal work. This requirement should be realized in the shortest possible time." According to Chairman Mao's profound instructions, giving full play to the great role of women in socialist construction is an extremely important task for our party organizations, the Communist Youth League, and the Women's Federation at present.

At present, our country is in a new situation of accelerating socialist construction and actively preparing conditions for the future transition to communism. Under the wise leadership of the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao, thanks to the victory of the national rectification and the anti-Rightist struggle since last year, thanks to the gradual mastery of our party's general line for socialist construction by the whole party and the people of the whole country, thanks to the improvement of the socialist consciousness of the people of our country and the great ideological liberation of the whole party and the whole people, an unprecedented great leap forward situation has emerged in our country's socialist construction. Under the new situation of such a great leap forward, it has also caused a huge change in the relations of production in our country, which is the new upsurge of people's communes that has appeared in the country in recent months. After more than a month, our country's rural areas have been fully people's communized. The people's commune not only made another great improvement and development in our country's relations of production, but also brought about huge changes in the way of life and ideological outlook of our society. One of the major changes is the implementation of collectivized life together with organizational militarization and action combatization. Due to the needs of collectivized life, rural public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, sewing groups, laundry groups, etc., have gradually and universally developed. According to preliminary incomplete statistics from nine provinces and cities in North and Northeast China, 1,074,400 public canteens, 1.7 million nurseries and kindergartens, and more than 47,500 homes for the elderly have been established in rural areas. The collectivization of life and socialization of housework that have emerged on the basis of communization are not only a major change in lifestyle, but also create extremely favorable new conditions for further liberating women's labor, and women are now able to completely get rid of the shackles of trivial housework. A new era of fully and fully exploiting the labor and creative talents of women has begun. This is another great victory of historical significance in our country's socialist transformation.

How to Mobilize Women's Labor Enthusiasm

Next year is a year of decisive significance for completing three years of hard work to change the face of most parts of our country. In order to accelerate the victory of our country's socialist construction, to ensure the needs of a greater leap forward in industry and agriculture, and to effectively solve the current labor shortage in urban and rural areas, it is necessary to further mobilize the labor enthusiasm of the people of the whole country, and further mobilize the labor enthusiasm of women and further giving play to their main force role on the production front is of greater significance.

How can we further bring into play the role of women as part of the main force in production and construction?

1. Correct erroneous perceptions. The primary obstacle to bringing into play the main force role of women in production is that some people, even some leading cadres, still underestimate the great role of women. They ignore the fundamental changes in the relations of production and lifestyles caused by the victory of the socialist revolution, and the huge impact of this change on the liberation of women, or excessively exaggerate the limitations of women's physiological characteristics. They do not understand that due to changes in historical conditions, due to the elimination of the exploitation system, and due to the abolition of the feudal and capitalist social systems, some of the phenomena that have long made women lag behind men in the old society can be quickly overcome. With the continuous victory of the cultural revolution and the technological revolution, the conditions of production technology are constantly changing, and the limitations of women's physiological characteristics will gradually decrease. Can't we now see everywhere that many women are becoming pilots and tractor drivers, and are becoming skilled workers operating various machines?! We should use the large number of facts about the main force role played by women on the production front to persuade those who have wrong perceptions. We should carry out a big airing of views and a big debate on this issue among cadres and the masses, and make full use of big-character posters for debate and criticism. Through debate and criticism, we should achieve the goal of correcting erroneous perceptions, unifying thinking, correcting the attitude of contempt for women, opposing discrimination against women on the production front, and completely eliminating the old concept of favoring men over women, which is an important task that cannot be ignored in order to completely complete the socialist transformation.

2. Women greatly improve their socialist and communist consciousness and improve their cultural level and production technology. That is to say, in order to further bring into play the main force role of women on the production front, we must first implement the principle of putting politics in command in women's work, guide the broad masses of women to strengthen political study, and gradually study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works. The method of study must be combined with the current actual life and the current ideological status of the masses to carry out self-education. In order to effectively assume the main force role in production, women must also constantly improve their production technology and constantly improve their cultural level. We must plan to enable most young and middle-aged women to have a certain level of culture, such as equivalent to the level of senior primary school or junior high school, in the next few years. And they must also have a certain technical level, that is, to enable every young and middle-aged woman to undertake a major labor operation in industrial and agricultural production, and on the basis of cultural and technical popularization, cultivate a large number of women experts in science and technology. It can be affirmed that as long as we strengthen the leadership of the Party and are good at constantly enlightening and improving the socialist and communist consciousness of the broad masses of women, the above goals can be quickly achieved.

3. Further improve the living welfare undertakings of the people's communes. The most important thing here is to run public canteens and nurseries and kindergartens well. According to recent statistics from nine provinces and cities in North and Northeast China, more than 24 million women's labor forces have been liberated due to the establishment of public canteens and welfare undertakings such as nurseries. From the perspective of some provinces and regions separately: Henan is 6.9 million people, Shandong is 7 million people, and the attendance rate of women in Shaanxi has increased from 60% in the past to 80%. Due to the canteenization in Heze Prefecture, Shandong, more than 700,000 women's labor forces can be saved every day. In some counties, such as Juye County, the attendance rate of women has jumped from 30% to 95%, and labor efficiency has also increased by 50%. It can be seen from this that the collectivization of life has had such a huge effect on liberating women's labor. However, until now, the development of collectivized life is not balanced enough across the country, and the work of public canteens and nurseries needs to be further greatly improved and strengthened. In order to further consolidate the collectivization of life, further liberate women's labor, and further consolidate the people's communes, the county and township party committees and women's federations need to vigorously strengthen the leadership of public canteens and nurseries, kindergartens, and homes for the elderly, and select some capable, politically strong cadres who care about the lives and interests of the masses to directly lead the canteen work and children's education work. We must ensure that these living welfare undertakings are run well. The standard for running them well is to make the canteen not only economical but also eat well and eat enough, to be clean and hygienic, and to satisfy everyone. Nurseries and kindergartens must ensure that children are physically and mentally healthy, can receive good socialist and collectivist education, and ensure that they do not transmit diseases, grow well, are healthy and lively, and that parents are at ease.

4. Actively cultivate and boldly promote women activists who are both red and expert to take on various leadership positions in county and township people's communes. In the socialist transformation and the great leap forward in production, a large number of young and middle-aged women activists have emerged in both rural and urban areas, and in various production departments. For these activists, especially young activists, we must strengthen education in a planned way and cultivate them carefully, so that they can gradually become both red and expert. In order to more effectively strengthen the leadership of the people's communes and to more widely and timely reflect the opinions of the masses of women, it is necessary to introduce and promote a large number of women cadres in the various levels and departments of the people's communes, and to make these women cadres assume various leadership responsibilities that they can assume, just like men. This is also a key to more smoothly giving play to the main force role of women in production.

5. Rationally use women's labor. On the one hand, we must gradually bring into play the main force role of women in production. It is completely wrong to adopt a negative attitude in this regard. This negative attitude is actually hindering the accelerated victory of socialist construction. But on the other hand, it is absolutely necessary to give appropriate care to the physiological characteristics of women in production labor. It is not permissible to ignore this necessary care. The correct method is to implement rational use of women's labor. Women should be fully mobilized to do the production labor that is suitable for women. In all possible and necessary production departments, men and women should cooperate with each other and work together. If some production labor women cannot fully be competent today, they should gradually cultivate their labor ability in this area, or gradually improve production conditions to make them suitable for women's labor. In short, fully mobilizing the high enthusiasm of women in socialist construction and further conscientiously giving play to the main force role of women, especially young and middle-aged women, in production and construction, is not only an urgent task to solve the current labor shortage, but also a major and fundamental task to accelerate the building of socialism and prepare conditions for the transition to communism.

    进一步发挥妇女在社会主义建设中的伟大作用
    陈正人
    我国广大的妇女劳动群众历来都富有勤劳勇敢的传统。在中国共产党的领导下，不论在长期的革命斗争中或者在当前的社会主义建设中，都曾经不断地显示出她们的巨大力量和巨大作用。事实已经证明，如果占人口一半的妇女群众这个伟大力量不能充分地发动起来，我国革命斗争的胜利和社会主义建设的胜利就是不可能的。我国妇女群众由于民主革命和社会主义革命的胜利，她们和全体人民一样，已经获得了彻底的社会解放。在政治上、经济上、文化上已经获得了和男子平等的权利。她们的社会主义觉悟正在不断提高，在社会生产中的作用正在不断增长。特别在近一年多来社会主义建设大跃进的形势下，妇女群众的社会主义积极性空前提高，并且在各个方面表现了她们无穷无尽的创造才能。足够估计和重视妇女群众在社会生产中的巨大作用，认真地把妇女劳力在工农业生产战线上提到重要的地位，就一定会大大加速我国社会主义建设的胜利，这也是保证我国社会将来顺利地向共产主义过渡极为重要的一个条件。
    发挥妇女在生产上的主力作用
    但是，对于妇女群众在社会主义建设中的巨大作用，在认识上还是不一致的。一部分人还存在着一些错误的认识。这些错误认识，概括起来是：妇女只能担负辅助劳动，不能担负主要劳动；只能担负轻劳动，不能胜任重劳动；只能搞简单的农业劳动，不能搞工业劳动，尤其是不能搞复杂的或重工业劳动。甚至有些人对于发挥妇女在生产战线上的更大作用，采取漠视的或消极的态度。当然妇女和男子比较起来有其一定的生理特点，忽视这个特点是不对的，在生产上和生活上对她们适当地加以照顾是完全必要的。但是，如果过分地夸大这个特点，那就是错误的了。实际情况究竟是怎样呢？我国广大的妇女劳动群众，一向就是在生产中的一个巨大力量。在不少地区，比如在广东、广西、江西、湖南、四川、云南、贵州等地一部分地区和其他地区，她们从来就起着生产中一部分主力作用。在解放以后，特别是在农业合作化以后，妇女在生产中的作用更是一天一天地大起来了。许多地区过去不直接参加农业生产主要劳动的，逐渐都参加了。在工业交通战线上，妇女参加劳动的也在不断地增加。特别是在最近一年多来，由于社会主义建设大跃进形势的鼓舞，妇女群众的社会主义觉悟和劳动积极性的提高，她们在生产战线上，已经起到的一部分主力作用，就日益显得突出。在最近波澜壮阔的炼铁炼钢运动中，妇女群众正在和男子一样并肩前进，她们在炼铁炼钢战线上正在不断创造奇迹。在四川出现了钢铁“三八”妇女营和许多的“妇女炉”群。湖南的妇女群众发出了这样的豪迈壮语：“妇女半边天，事事要争先”。该省有六十万妇女大军直接参加了炼铁炼钢生产。在农业战线上，由于全国最近有五千万个主要劳力（其中包括部分妇女劳力）投入了炼铁炼钢运动，因此，农业生产上的许多主要劳动就不能不落在妇女的身上来了。正如湖南省宜章县的妇女所提出的：“男子大力炼钢铁，妇女接班搞农业”。该县四万多名青壮年妇女掀起了“人人学技术，个个当能手”的学习高潮，全县已有80％的妇女学会了犁田、整地等基本农业活，有许多妇女成为多面手，并有九千多名妇女被评为水稻、红薯、养猪等生产能手。又据湖南省9月底统计，全省每天出工的妇女有一千零十五万人，占农村妇女总人口的64％，较之过去同时期出工人数增加一倍以上，其中参加农业生产的有八百万人，占目前农业出工人数的80％。由此可以看出，在湖南省妇女已经成为农业生产战线上的主力军了。在这种情况下，该省虽然抽调了40％的男劳力搞钢铁，但冬耕播种工作都以每天完成近一百万亩的速度跃进，比以往任何一年都快。事实就是这样，现在我们到处可以看到广大地区的妇女群众不论在深翻地或秋收、秋种上，在兴修水利上，在交通运输上，她们越来越多地同男子一起起着主力的作用。这些事实就充分证明，妇女群众和男子一样日益成为我国社会主义建设上的主力军。毛主席在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”一书的批语中，曾几次强调发动妇女群众参加社会主义建设的极端重要性。他说：“为了建设伟大的社会主义社会，发动广大的妇女群众参加生产活动，具有极大的意义。”又说：“中国的妇女是一种伟大的人力资源。必须发掘这种资源，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。”在另一个地方又指出：要“使全部妇女劳动力，在同工同酬的原则下，一律参加到劳动战线上去，这个要求，应当在尽可能短的时间内，予以实现”。按照毛主席这些深刻的指示，充分发挥妇女在社会主义建设上的伟大作用，这就是我们党组织、共青团和妇联在当前一项极为重大的任务。
    目前我国正处在加速建设社会主义并为着将来向共产主义过渡积极准备条件的新形势前面。在中共中央和毛主席的英明领导下，由于去年以来全民整风和反右派斗争的胜利，由于我们党的社会主义建设总路线为全党和全国人民所逐渐掌握，由于我国人民社会主义觉悟的提高和全党全民思想的大解放，我国的社会主义建设出现了空前大跃进局面。在这样大跃进的新形势下，又引起了我国社会生产关系的巨大变化，这就是最近几月来出现在全国范围内的人民公社的新高潮。经过最近一个多月的时间，我国农村已经全面地人民公社化了。人民公社化不仅使我国的生产关系获得了又一次的巨大改进和发展，而且使得我国社会的生活方式和思想面貌产生了巨大的变化。其中一个重大的变化，就是和组织军事化、行动战斗化一起实行了生活集体化。由于生活集体化的需要，农村的公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、幸福院、缝纫组、洗衣组等等逐渐地普遍地发展起来了。根据华北、东北九个省市初步的不完全统计，在农村已经组成了公共食堂一百零七万四千个，托儿所、幼儿园一百七十万个，幸福院四万七千五百多个。在公社化的基础上所出现的生活集体化和家务劳动的社会化，不仅是生活方式上的重大变革，而且为进一步解放妇女劳力，创造了极为有利的新条件，妇女从此有可能彻底地摆脱繁琐的家务束缚。全面地充分地发挥妇女的劳动创造才能的新时期已经开始到来了。这是我国社会主义改造又一次有历史意义的伟大胜利。
    怎样调动妇女劳动积极性
    明年是完成苦战三年改变我国大部分地区面貌有决定意义的一年。为了加速我国社会主义建设的胜利，保证工农业更大跃进的需要，为了有效地解决目前城乡劳力的紧张情况，必须进一步调动全国人民的劳动积极性，而进一步调动妇女的劳动积极性，进一步发挥她们在生产战线上的主力作用，更有其重大意义。
    要怎样才能进一步发挥妇女在生产建设上的一部分主力的作用呢？
    一、纠正错误认识。发挥妇女在生产中主力作用的首要障碍，就是一部分人甚至一部分领导干部直到现在还是对妇女的巨大作用估计不足。他们忽视了由于社会主义革命胜利所引起的生产关系和生活方式的根本变化，以及这个变化对于解放妇女的巨大影响，或者过分夸大妇女在生理特点上的限制。他们不了解由于历史条件的变化，由于剥削制度的消灭，由于封建主义和资本主义社会制度的被废除，妇女在旧社会长期所造成的某些落后于男子的现象是可以迅速被克服的。由于文化革命和技术革命不断胜利，生产技术条件正在不断变化，妇女在生理特点上的限制，也将会逐渐减少。我们现在不是到处都可以看到有许多妇女正在成为飞行员、拖拉机手，正在成为操纵各种机器的熟练的劳动者吗！？我们应该利用妇女在生产战线上所起到的主力作用的大量事实，去说服那些具有错误认识的人们。应该在干部中和群众中就这个问题进行大鸣大放，充分利用大字报进行大辩论，经过辩论批判，达到纠正错误认识，统一思想，纠正对于妇女的轻视态度，反对在生产战线上歧视妇女，彻底消灭重男轻女的旧观念，正是彻底完成社会主义改造必不可忽视的一项重大任务。
    二、妇女群众大大提高社会主义和共产主义觉悟，提高文化水平和生产技术。这就是说要进一步发挥妇女在生产战线上的主力作用，首先就要在妇女工作方面实行政治挂帅，要引导广大妇女群众加强政治学习，并且要逐步地学习马列主义，学习毛泽东著作。学习的方法，必须是结合当前的实际生活，结合群众思想现状，进行自我教育。为了切实地担负起生产中的主力作用，妇女群众还必须不断地提高生产技术，不断地提高文化水平。要有计划地在最近几年内使大多数青壮年妇女都具有一定的文化水平，比如相等于高小或初中的水平。并且还必须具有一定的技术水平，就是使每一个青壮年妇女，都能担负起工农业生产中某一项主要的劳动操作，并且要在文化、技术普及的基础上，培养科学技术上大批的妇女专家。可以肯定，只要我们加强党的领导，善于不断地启发和提高广大妇女的社会主义和共产主义觉悟，上述目的是完全可以迅速达到的。
    三、要进一步搞好人民公社的生活福利事业。这里最主要的是要办好公共食堂和托儿所、幼儿园。根据最近华北、东北等九省市的统计，由于举办了公共食堂和托儿所等生活福利事业，解放出来的妇女劳力达到二千四百多万人。从一些省区分别来看：河南是六百九十万人，山东是七百万人，陕西妇女的出勤率由过去的60％提高到80％。山东菏泽专区由于食堂化，每天能节约妇女劳力七十万个以上。有些县份如巨野县，妇女出勤率由30％跃增到95％，劳动效率还提高了50％。由此可以看到，生活集体化对于解放妇女劳力发生了何等的巨大作用。但是，直到现在生活集体化在全国发展还是不够平衡，公共食堂和托儿所的工作，还有待于进一步大力改善和加强。为了进一步巩固生活集体化，进一步解放妇女劳力，并且为了进一步巩固人民公社，县、乡两级党委和妇联组织有必要大力加强对公共食堂和托儿所、幼儿园、幸福院的领导，要选派一些得力的、政治上坚强的、关心群众生活利益的干部直接领导食堂工作和儿童教养工作。必须把这些生活福利事业保证办好。办好的标准就是要使食堂做到既能节约又能吃得好、吃得饱，做到清洁卫生，大家满意。托儿所、幼儿园必须做到使儿童身心健康，既能受到良好的社会主义、集体主义教育，又能保证不传染疾病，长得好，健康活泼，父母放心。
    四、要积极培养、大胆提拔又红又专的妇女积极分子，担任县、乡人民公社的各项领导工作。在社会主义改造和生产大跃进中，不论在农村或城市，也不论在各种不同的生产部门中都不断涌现出大批的青壮年妇女积极分子。对于这些积极分子，特别是青年积极分子，必须有计划地加强教育，认真培养，使他们逐渐做到又红又专。为了能够更有效地加强人民公社领导，能够更广泛地及时地反映妇女群众的意见，必须在人民公社的各级机构和各个部门中大量引进和提拔妇女干部，并要使这些妇女干部和男子一样担负她们可能担负的各种领导责任。这也是为了更顺利地发挥妇女在生产上的主力作用的一个关键。
    五、合理地使用妇女劳力。我们一方面要逐步发挥妇女在生产上的一部分主力作用，在这方面采取消极态度是完全错误的，这种消极态度实际上就是在阻碍社会主义建设的加速胜利。但是另一方面在生产劳动上对于妇女的生理特点加以适当照顾，也是完全必要的，忽视这种必要的照顾是不许可的。正确的办法，就是对妇女劳力要实行合理使用，凡是适合于妇女的生产劳动应该充分地发动妇女来做，在一切可能和需要的生产部门，要实行男女互相协作，共同劳动。有些生产劳动妇女今天还不能完全胜任的，就要逐步培养她们这方面的劳动能力，或者要逐步改善生产条件，使之适合于妇女劳动。总之，充分发动妇女在社会主义建设上的高度积极性，进一步认真地发挥妇女特别是青壮年妇女在生产建设上的主力作用，不但对于解决目前劳力紧张的情况，实属刻不容缓，对于加速建成社会主义为过渡到共产主义准备条件，也是一项重大的根本任务。
