Tempering Oneself in Communist Labor
Wu Chuanqi

During the high tide of the whole people undertaking steelmaking, we came to Wuhan from Beijing. On both sides of the railway for over a thousand kilometers, we saw fiery dragons and seas of fire, a truly bustling and vigorous scene. By extension, along other railways, highways, rivers, and especially in mines and factories, countless people were happily laboring for the ascension of the Iron Marshal.

"Refining steel and iron also refines people; molten iron boils, and people also turn red." This is the slogan of the people of Wuhan in undertaking steelmaking on a large scale. People's thoughts are indeed boiling along with the molten iron. Upon entering Wuhan, along the roadsides, sidewalks, basements, and alley entrances, we saw piles of iron sand, coke, and kaolin, and groups of people laboring, men, women, old, and young, all "doing their best" to pound iron sand, make crucibles, transport materials, and watch the furnace fire; the scale, the depth of mobilization, and especially the communist labor spirit of the masses, were truly inspiring.

Like other cities, students from Wuhan's universities, middle schools, and upper grades of elementary schools all participated in the steelmaking campaign. One student asked the teacher when they would return to the classroom to study, and the teacher replied: This is the classroom, this is studying. A very good answer! This is indeed the best lesson, the great lesson of communist labor. Their participation in this labor is voluntary, not for wages or rewards, but simply to bring about the early ascension of the Iron Marshal, accelerate the construction of socialism, and transition to communism ahead of schedule.

Today, throughout the country, on all fronts, this great communist labor, which is developing day by day, is of course unimaginable to the bourgeoisie. They always use their own ideas, the so-called "man is a selfish animal," "man dies for wealth, and birds die for food," to measure people. Therefore, they cannot help but think that people's labor cannot have a nobler purpose other than "selfishness and self-interest."

The bourgeoisie once further developed this view to defend the capitalist system. They said that if capitalist private ownership is eliminated, people will become lazy. The "Communist Manifesto" pointed out: "It has been objected that upon the abolition of private property, all work will cease, and universal laziness will overtake us." The "Manifesto" powerfully refuted this by saying: "According to this, bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone to the dogs through sheer idleness; for those of its members who work, acquire nothing, and those who acquire anything, do not work. All objections urged against the Communistic mode of producing and appropriating material products, have, in the same way, been urged against the Communistic modes of producing and appropriating intellectual products. Just as, to the bourgeois, the disappearance of class property is the disappearance of production itself, so the disappearance of class culture is to him identical with the disappearance of all culture." It should be said that in capitalist society, a group of lazy people are destined to emerge, namely those who get rich by occupying the means of production, those who "gain without labor."

Under the socialist system, "labor for oneself" replaces "wage labor," "namely, replacing enslaved labor with planned and organized labor on a vast national (and to a considerable extent, international, global) scale" (Lenin, "How to Organize Competition?").

However, for a certain period, due to insufficient development of production and the masses' insufficient level of awareness, it is necessary to temporarily implement the principle of "to each according to his work" in the distribution relationship. And those who are accustomed to viewing problems from a bourgeois perspective absolutize this principle. They believe that if this principle is shaken, and if we move towards a higher principle when conditions are ripe, such as implementing a supply system, "universal laziness will overtake us." This view still sees people only as "selfish animals" and has not broken away from the bourgeois view that labor is only for the individual.

Our view is completely opposite. We believe that "universal laziness" can only be the product of the bourgeoisie's unearned income, selfishness, self-interest, and love of ease and aversion to work. As for gradually breaking through the boundaries of "to each according to his work" when conditions are ripe, it can only promote the communist spirit and cultivate a communist attitude towards labor. Does not the communist voluntary labor that we are universally carrying out today precisely illustrate this point?

Selfishness is a product of thousands of years of private society. The victory of the socialist revolution has realized the public ownership of the means of production in the economic field, but to achieve a fundamental change in the ideological realm is a very profound process. However, in our society today, this ideological change has already begun among the broad masses of the people. This change is first manifested in people's communist attitude towards labor.

Therefore, the great significance of the broad masses of the people participating in voluntary labor and undertaking steelmaking on a large scale lies in the fact that this will not only create the material basis for the transition to communism; but also refine the ideological basis of communism, refine the communist attitude towards labor, and refine new communist people. Lenin pointed out: "We must strive to abolish the accursed rule: 'Everyone for himself, God for all', the habit of regarding labor merely as a duty, and of considering rightful only labor that is paid for at a definite rate. We must strive to introduce into the public mind, make it a habit, and bring into the day-by-day life of the masses, the rule: 'Everyone for all, and all for everyone', and gradually get the people accustomed to the observance of this rule; we must consistently and unswervingly work for the introduction of communist discipline and communist labor." We are steadfastly moving in the direction pointed out by Lenin. Actual life has been constantly breaking through the narrow boundaries of bourgeois legal rights, communist labor has been growing stronger day by day, and is becoming the "habit" and "daily life" of the working people. I advise those who have an incorrect understanding of the principle of "to each according to his work," as well as those who "pay for labor" and "labor for pay," to come to the laboring masses to participate in the actual tempering of communist labor, and learn from the workers' drive and their great communist style.

    共产主义劳动中锻炼自己
    吴传启
    在全民大办钢铁的高潮中，我们从北京来到了武汉。在这一千多公里的铁路两侧，只见一条条的火龙，一片片的火海，真是热火朝天，轰轰烈烈。推而广之，在其他铁路两侧、公路两旁、江河两岸，特别是矿山工厂，真不知有多少万人为钢铁元帅升帐而愉快地劳动着。
    “炼钢炼铁又炼人，铁水沸腾人也红”。这是武汉市人民大办钢铁的口号。人们的思想也的确同铁水一道沸腾着。一进武汉市，在马路两旁、人行道、地下室、里弄口，只见一堆堆的铁砂、焦炭和观音土，一群群的劳动着的人们，男女老少，都“各尽所能”地捶铁砂，做坩埚，运材料，看炉火；规模之大，动员之深，特别是群众的共产主义劳动精神，真是令人振奋。
    同其他城市一样，武汉的大中学校的学生和小学的高年级学生，都参加了炼钢运动。有一个学生问老师什么时候回课堂上课，老师回答说：这就是课堂，这就是上课。回答的很好！这确实是最好的一课，是伟大的共产主义劳动之课。他们参加这种劳动是义务劳动，不是为了工资和报酬，只是为了叫钢铁元帅早些升帐，加速建设社会主义，提前向共产主义过渡。
    今天在全国范围内，在各个战线上，日益开展着的这种伟大的共产主义劳动，在资产阶级看来，当然是不可想像的。他们总是用他们自己的思想、所谓“人是自私的动物”、“人为财死，鸟为食亡”来衡量人，于是他们就不能不认为人们的劳动除了“自私自利”的目的以外，就不能有更高尚的目的。
    资产阶级曾经进一步发挥他们这个观点，来替资本主义制度辩护。他们说，如果消灭了资本主义私有制，人们就会变成懒汉。“共产党宣言”就指出过：“有人反驳说，私有制一旦消灭，一切活动都会停止，懒惰之风就会代之而兴。”“宣言”有力地驳斥说：“这样说来，资产阶级社会应该是早早就因为懒惰而灭亡了，因为在这个社会里是劳者不获，获者不劳的。所有这一切顾虑，都归结为这样一句同义反复语：一旦没有了资本，也就不会再有雇佣劳动了。”应该说，在资本主义社会里，倒注定要出一批懒汉，这就是那些借着占有生产资料而发财致富的“不劳而获”的人们。
    在社会主义制度下，“自为的劳动”代替了“雇佣劳动”，“即用在全国的（在相当程度上也是在国际的，在世界的）巨大范围内有计划有组织的劳动来代替奴役劳动”　（列宁：“怎样组织比赛？”）。
    但是在一定时期内，由于生产不够发展，群众的觉悟程度还不高，在分配关系上也就不得不暂时实行“按劳取酬”的原则。而那些惯于按资产阶级观点看问题的人们，却把这个原则绝对化。他们认为，如果动摇了这个原则，在条件具备的时候走向更高的原则，比如说要实行供给制的话，“懒惰之风就会代之而兴”。这种看法，仍然是把人只看成是“自私的动物”，而没有摆脱劳动只是为了个人的资产阶级观点。
    我们的看法则完全相反。我们认为“懒惰之风”，只能是资产阶级的不劳而获、自私自利和好逸恶劳的产物。至于在条件具备的时候逐步冲破“按劳取酬”的界线，则只能兴共产主义之风，培植共产主义的劳动态度。今天我们所普遍开展的共产主义的义务劳动，不正好说明了这个问题吗？
    自私观念是人类几千年来的私有社会的产物。社会主义革命的胜利，在经济领域内实现了生产资料的公有制，但是要实现观念形态上的根本变革，却是一个极深刻的过程。然而在我们今天的社会里，这种思想变革已经在广大人民群众中开始了。这种变化首先就表现在人们的共产主义式的劳动态度上。
    因此，广大人民群众参加义务劳动、大炼钢铁的伟大意义就在于：这不仅会创造向共产主义过渡的物质基础；而且会炼出共产主义的思想基础，炼出共产主义的劳动态度和共产主义的新人。列宁指出过：“我们要努力消灭‘人人为自己，上帝为大家’这个可诅咒的常规，克服那种认为劳动只是一种负担，而凡是劳动都应当付给一定报酬的习惯。我们要努力把‘人人为我，我为人人’和‘各尽所能，各取所需’的原则灌输到群众的思想中去，变成他们的习惯，变成他们的生活常规，我们要逐步地坚持不懈地实行共产主义纪律，推行共产主义劳动。”我们正在坚定地朝着列宁所指出的方向前进。实际生活已经不断冲破着资产阶级法权思想的狭隘界线，共产主义的劳动已经一天天地发扬光大，正在变成劳动人民的“习惯”和“生活常规”。奉劝那些对“按劳取酬”原则有不正确认识的人们，以及那些“按酬付劳”和“为酬而劳”的人们，最好到劳动群众中来参加共产主义劳动的实际锻炼，学习劳动者的干劲和他们的伟大的共产主义风格。
