Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, November 1st - Hong Kong's "Sing Tao Daily" published an editorial today entitled "'Peace Talks' and 'Two Chinas'," believing that the result of the U.S. creating "two Chinas" "is likely to force peace talks" and "force a single China." It said, "Some people in the United States advocate engaging in 'two Chinas', 'divide and conquer', which both the National Government (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) and the CCP oppose. If the U.S. forces people too much, it may force 'peace talks'."

The newspaper, which has ties to Taiwan, quoted in its editorial the full text of the Xinhua News Agency's October 30th reprint of the "Wall Street Journal's" October 20th article "Clarifying China Policy." In this article, the "Wall Street Journal" commentator said that the U.S. government's current policy is to create "two Chinas" under the guise of "peace." In promoting this scheme, the United States does not take Chiang Kai-shek into account, but instead wants to gradually abandon Chiang Kai-shek.

After quoting this American newspaper article, the "Sing Tao Daily" said angrily, "It is very dangerous for a newspaper representing the American Wall Street financial groups to say this. If the United States engages in 'two Chinas', the result will inevitably 'force' a single China." The newspaper believes that the U.S.'s "two Chinas" conspiracy is creating an opportunity for "peace talks."

This pro-Kuomintang newspaper finally warned the United States that the relationship between the United States and the Taiwan authorities "has reached an unprecedentedly serious stage. If the United States does not act cautiously, it will regret it too late," and that the United States "if it does so, is truly putting a death noose around its own neck."

Hong Kong's pro-Chiang "Free Man" biweekly published an article on October 29, also admitting that the United States is engaged in a "two Chinas" conspiracy. The article, sent from New Jersey by a Taiwanese Kuomintang member, stated that the United States has a plan to "place Taiwan and Penghu under UN trusteeship, temporarily entrusting them to 'General Chiang Kai-shek' for governance," and then hold a "referendum" in the future to "choose independence." The article said that in recent years, the idea of "two Chinas" has been "rampant" in the United States. The US proposal for "ceasefire" and "reliance on political means" is "not out of naivety or 'Amitabha Buddha'-like prayer that the two brothers would not fight to the point of bloodshed, but out of fear that this wildfire would burn their sleeves and eyebrows." The article pointed out that "the United States does not have any special affection for Taiwan (referring to the Kuomintang authorities)," it is only "for its rights and interests and influence in the Far East. This is consistent in the foreign policy of both the Republican and Democratic parties."

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, October 31st - Hong Kong's "Hong Kong Commercial Daily" published an article on the 30th saying that the Chiang-Dulles talks communique was a "humiliating" document of the Taiwan authorities "succumbing to American pressure" and was "the most serious blow" the Americans gave to the Taiwan authorities.

The Kuomintang newspaper article began by saying, "We accept this painful failure of the Sino-American talks with a heavy heart. We believe that this failure is the most serious blow suffered by the government (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) since its withdrawal from the mainland. The reaction to this blow will be grief and indignation, pessimism and disappointment." The article also said, "This is a fact that we should have the courage to admit, a fact that the government authorities (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) do not need to hide or deceive themselves with."

The article wrote: "If we pay a little attention to the history of Sino-American relations (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) over the past thirteen years, we will know that what is shown in today's Sino-American joint communiqué (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) is nothing strange. From Marshall's mission to China to Dulles' visit to China (referring to Taiwan) this time, the principles of the United States' policy toward China (referring to the Chiang group) have not changed at all. The first unchanging thing is fear of the Communists and contempt for the government of the Republic of China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group). The second unchanging thing is to take a great power's dominating attitude, only caring about its own interests and not caring about the interests of the Republic of China (referring to the Taiwan authorities)."

The newspaper listed a series of facts to show that the United States has been bullying the Chiang Kai-shek group. It said indignantly, "To put it bluntly, the United States' policy is 100% base-ism. Under this doctrine, the government of the Republic of China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) will be frozen, Taiwan will be isolated, and Taiwan will be determined as their military base. The officials and soldiers of the Republic of China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) are in fact helping them watch the base. Of course, the United States is the main body of everything in Taiwan. … What is proposed in today's Sino-American joint communiqué (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) is only to concretize and superficialize these practices to determine Taiwan as a US military base."

The newspaper said that the Chiang Kai-shek group "overly trusts the United States, overly trusts the friendship of the Republican Party, but missed many major events and sacrificed many sovereign rights." It asked, after nine years of wandering and hardship, "Will the Taiwan authorities be planning to grow old in Taiwan? Or are they reveling in the dream of 'overseas Fuyu' and living peacefully in a 'small country with few people', the dilapidated and remnants of a 'small court'?"

    香港亲蒋报纸埋怨美国欺压台湾当局
    认为美国搞“两个中国”就是自套绞索
    新华社香港1日电　香港“星岛日报”今天发表了题为“‘和谈’与‘两个中国’”的社论，认为美国制造“两个中国”的结果，“很可能迫出和谈来”，“迫成一个中国”。它说，“美国若干人主张搞‘两个中国’，‘分而治之’，这是国民政府（指蒋介石集团）与中共都反对的。如果美迫人太过，很可迫出‘和谈’来。”
    这家与台湾有关系的报纸在社论中，引用了新华社在10月30日转发的“华尔街日报”10月20日刊登的“澄清对华政策”的文章摘要的电讯全文。“华尔街日报”评论员在这篇文章中说，美国政府现在的政策是在“和平”幌子下制造“两个中国”。在推行这一诡计时，美国并不把蒋介石放在眼内，而是要逐步抛弃蒋介石。
      “星岛日报”在引用这篇美国报纸的文章后愤愤地说，“代表美国华尔街财阀的报纸，如此说法，是非常之危险。美国如果搞‘两个中国’，结果必‘迫成’一个中国”。这家报纸认为，美国搞“两个中国”的阴谋，就是在制造“和谈”的机会。
    这家亲国民党报纸最后向美国警告说，美国和台湾当局的关系“已临空前严重的阶段。美国如果不谨慎从事，将后悔莫及”，而美国“如果这样做，真是把绝命绞索套在自己的颈上”。
    香港亲蒋的“自由人”半周刊在10月29日登载了一篇文章，也承认美国正在搞“两个中国”的阴谋。这篇由台湾国民党人士从美国新泽西州寄来的文章中说，美国有把台湾、澎湖“交联合国托管，由联合国再暂交‘蒋介石将军’管治”，将来再举行“公民投票”、“选择独立”的计划。文章说，近年来“两个中国”之说在美国“甚嚣尘上”。而美国提出所谓“停火”、“凭借政治”等等，“亦并非天真或‘阿弥陀佛’般祝祷两家兄弟不要再打到头破血流，而只是恐惧这种野火会烧到他们的衣袖和发眉”。文章指出，“美国尤非有特殊厚爱于台湾（指国民党当局）”，它只不过是“为了它在远东的权益和势力。而这是共和及民主两党在外交政策上都是一致的”。
    新华社香港31日电　香港“工商日报”30日发表了一篇文章说，蒋杜会谈公报是台湾当局“屈服于美国压力之下”的“耻辱”的文件，是美国人给台湾当局的“最严重的一次打击”。
    这家国民党报纸的文章开首就说，“我们以沉痛的心情接受这一次中（蒋）美会谈的惨痛失败。我们认为，这一次失败是政府（指蒋介石集团）退出大陆以后遭到的最严重的一次打击。反应在这一打击者，将是悲愤，将是悲观与失望。”文章又说，“这是一个我们应该有勇气承认的事实，一个政府当局（指蒋介石集团）不必隐讳，不必饰词自欺的事实。”
    文章写道：“如果稍为留心这十三年来的中（指蒋介石集团）美关系史，就知道今日中（蒋）美联合公报所显示的，并不是什么奇怪之事。由马歇尔使华，到此次杜勒斯访华（指台湾），美国对华（指蒋集团）政策，其原则根本没有变。第一个不变是怕共，瞧不起中华民国政府（指蒋介石集团），第二个不变是以大国支配的态度，只顾自己的利益，不顾中华民国（指台湾当局）的利益”。
    这家报纸列举了一系列的事实，说明美国一直都在欺压蒋介石集团。它愤慨地说，“明白点说，美国的政策，百分之百，就是基地主义，在这主义之下，将是冻结中华民国政府（指蒋介石集团），孤立台湾，使台湾确定为他们的军事基地，而中华民国（指蒋介石集团）的官员士兵，事实是做他们看守基地的旁助力。当然，台湾的一切是由他们充当主体的。……今天中（蒋）美联合公报所提出的，不过是把这些使台湾确定为美国的军事基地的做法具体化、表面化而已”。
    这家报纸说，蒋介石集团“过信美国，过信美国共和党的友谊，却误了不少大事，牺牲了不少主权”。它问道，台湾当局经过九年来的流浪艰苦岁月，“竟会作着终老台湾的打算吗？抑或陶醉着‘海外扶余’之梦，与安心过着‘小国寡民’、‘小朝廷’的破落残余生活吗？”
