A Brilliant Example of a Communist Fighter
Introducing "Biography of Sverdlov"
Zhu Wushan

Ya. M. Sverdlov was an outstanding Soviet party and state activist, one of Lenin's closest comrades and assistants. In 1957, the Soviet Young Guard Publishing House published "Biography of Sverdlov," written by Sverdlov's wife and comrade, K. T. Sverdlova. This book was very popular among readers in Soviet society. Now, the Chinese translation of this book will be published by People's Publishing House. It will surely be warmly welcomed by our readers as well. Sverdlov's life was a life of fighting for communism. Our readers, especially our young readers, will surely be deeply educated by this book.

The first five chapters of this book elaborate on Sverdlov's childhood and youth, as well as his underground revolutionary activities before 1917. Sverdlov was not yet sixteen years old when he participated in underground revolutionary work. On December 20, 1901, Lenin's "Iskra" reported: "Former middle school student Sverdlov was arrested on December 3 on suspicion of participating in the November 7 demonstration." This young revolutionary first became known in the Bolshevik ranks. Shortly after being released from prison, he was arrested again for participating in the "May Day" demonstration in 1902, which was famous in Russia as a political demonstration movement. On May 15, Gorky wrote from Arzamas in a mocking tone about this incident: "An amazing event happened in Nizhny! What a strange thing! The wicked criminal, political agitator, and revolutionary sculptor Sverdlov's two sons were arrested and thrown into prison... It's thorough enough! Now order is restored, and Russia is saved!..." This young revolutionary, from the moment he entered the struggle, was full of energy and great ability, and was noticed by the local police and gendarmes. By 1903, he had been arrested five times. However, it was these persecutions that tempered this young revolutionary, making him more courageous and experienced, and turning him into an outstanding Bolshevik.

Sverdlov devoted himself to the revolution from his youth. In his short life (he was not yet thirty-four years old when he passed away), he was arrested fourteen times and spent twelve years in prison and exile. The author vividly reflects the glorious struggle experience of this Bolshevik underground worker in this book. Sverdlov first met his future wife (the author of this book) in 1905 in Yekaterinburg. The then-only twenty-year-old representative of the Party Central Committee was sent there because the Party wanted to strengthen the work of the Party in the Ural region. This was the beginning of Sverdlov's formal leadership of Party work. Soon after he arrived, the activities of the Party's underground organization greatly increased. Readers will read in this book about Sverdlov's active activities in secret workers' groups in Nizhny Novgorod, Yaroslavl, Kazan, Chistopol, Perm, and Yekaterinburg, and in the Bolshevik underground organization. The author quoted many old Bolsheviks in this book, recalling that in the revolutionary organization in the Urals at that time, everyone talked about the new representative sent by the Central Committee. Everyone regarded him as a great organizer, a lively speaker, and an outstanding propagandist. Sverdlov's main principle in doing Party work was to follow the mass line. He was able to deeply understand the feelings and needs of the masses, and he was good at implementing the Party's line among the masses, mobilizing the strength and wisdom inside and outside the Party, and jointly fighting for the overall goal of overthrowing the Tsar. Therefore, the police and secret agents were driven mad by him and desperately tried to arrest him, but they were always unable to catch this outstanding underground worker for a long time.

From 1901 to 1910, this young revolutionary lived in prison life intermittently. On December 3, 1909, only three months after he came out of prison, he was arrested again at a meeting of the Moscow Provincial Party Committee. At this time, he was only twenty-five years old, and it was already the seventh time he had been arrested. In March 1910, Sverdlov was exiled to the Narym region, which was the first time he had lived in exile. Readers will see in this book that Sverdlov was never isolated from the outside world, whether in prison or in exile. In prison, he not only issued instructions to the Bolsheviks in Perm, but also organized study groups for revolutionary political prisoners. He also constantly strived for self-study, deeply studied the classic works of Marxism-Leninism, and learned German and French... No matter what the occasion, he often debated with Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, refuting them speechless. All of this shows that this great young revolutionary, although he had been in painful prisons and desolate exile areas for a long time, his revolutionary spirit could not be destroyed in any way. On the contrary, he could use every minute to carry out undertakings beneficial to the revolution. He wrote: "I will never waste my energy on emotional outbursts, my energy will have another most rational use."

The last three chapters of this book vividly and meticulously describe the activities of this energetic revolutionary on the eve of the October Revolution, demonstrating his unwavering adherence to the correct line of the Party and Lenin and his belief in the power of the people. When the October Revolution began, he was still in exile in Turukhansk. As soon as he was released, he immediately came to Petrograd and plunged into the struggle. After the July Days, Lenin had to temporarily hide, and Sverdlov, in a very difficult environment, together with Lenin's other comrades-in-arms, adhered to Lenin's line, united the Party and the working class, and strived to implement Lenin's instructions quickly and accurately.

In many chapters, we can see that Sverdlov treated comrades and workers with care and kindness in his work, while he was relentless and uncompromising towards the enemies of the Party and the people. We can also see his noble character of hard work and simplicity. Sverdlov worked hard all his life, striving for the people and the socialist revolution at all costs. Until the eve of his death, he was still engaged in intense work.

The tempering of a long and arduous struggle has endowed Sverdlov with all the excellent qualities of a great revolutionary. At the emergency meeting of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee on March 8, 1919, Lenin said: "Comrade Ya. M. Sverdlov is an eternal symbol of a revolutionary's loyalty to his cause, an example of calm and skillful handling of practical work, close contact with the masses, and good at leading the masses, and a guarantee that more and more proletarian masses will emulate this example, constantly move forward, and achieve the complete victory of the world communist revolution." Sverdlov has set a brilliant example of a communist fighter for us.

    共产主义战士的光辉榜样
    介绍“斯维尔德洛夫传”
    朱务善
    雅·米·斯维尔德洛夫是一位杰出的苏联党和国家的活动家，列宁的最亲近的战友和助手之一。1957年苏联青年近卫军出版社出版了“斯维尔德洛夫传”一书，这本书是斯维尔德洛夫的妻子和战友克·集·斯维尔德洛娃写的。它在苏联社会上很受读者欢迎。现在，这本书的中译本将由人民出版社出版。它也必将得到我国读者的热烈欢迎。斯维尔德洛夫的一生，正是为争取共产主义而战斗的一生。我国读者，特别是我国青年读者必将从这本书中受到深刻的教育。
    这本书的前五章阐述了斯维尔德洛夫的童年和青年时代的生活，以及他在1917年以前的地下革命工作活动。斯维尔德洛夫在参加地下革命工作时还不满十六岁。1901年12月20日列宁的“火星报”报道：“前中学生斯维尔德洛夫因参加11月7日示威游行的嫌疑在12月3日被捕。”这位少年革命家首次在布尔什维克队伍中知名。出狱后不久，他又因参加1902年在俄国以政治示威运动而著名的“五一”示威而被捕入狱。高尔基就这件事在5月15日以嘲笑的口吻曾从阿尔扎马斯写信说：“尼日尼发生了惊人事件！咄咄怪事！把万恶的罪犯，政治鼓动家，革命党人雕刻家斯维尔德洛夫两个儿子都抓起来，投入监狱……真够彻底！现在秩序井然，俄罗斯得救了！……”这位少年革命家一开始投入斗争，干劲十足，本领很大，为当地警察宪兵所注目。到1903年，他已经被捕过五次了。但是，正是这些迫害，锻炼了这位青年革命家，使他更有勇气更有经验地成为一个卓越的布尔什维克。
    斯维尔德洛夫自少年投入革命，在短短的一生中（他逝世时还不满三十四岁），被捕十四次，有十二年过着监狱和流放的艰苦生活。作者在这本书中鲜明地反映出这位布尔什维克的地下工作者的光荣斗争经历。斯维尔德洛夫第一次和他未来的妻子（即本书作者）见面，是1905年在伊卡特伦堡地方的事情。这位当时只有二十岁的党中央代表，是因为当时党要加强乌拉尔区党的工作派到那里的，这是斯维尔德洛夫正式领导党工作的开始。他到这里不久，党的地下组织的活动就大大地活跃起来。读者在这本书里将读到斯维尔德洛夫在尼日尼弗哥罗德、雅罗斯拉夫、喀山、祁斯特罗姆、皮尔姆、伊卡特伦堡的秘密工人小组，在布尔什维克地下组织中的积极活动。作者在这本书中引用了不少老布尔什维克的回忆道，当时在乌拉尔的革命组织里，一谈就谈到中央新派来的这位代表。大家都把他当作一位大组织家，生动的演说家，杰出的宣传家。斯维尔德洛夫作党的工作的主要原则，就是走群众路线。他能深深地体会群众的感情和需要，又善于把党的路线贯彻到群众中去，发动党内外的力量和智慧，为打倒沙皇的总目标共同斗争。因此，警察和暗探因他气得发狂，拚命进行追捕，但是，他们总是长期抓不住这个出色的地下工作者。
    自1901年到1910年，这位青年革命家或断或续地过着监狱生活。在1909年12月3日当他从监狱里出来仅仅三个月时间，他又在莫斯科省党委会议上被捕了。这时他正是二十五岁，被捕已经是第七次。1910年3月，斯维尔德洛夫被流放到纳雷姆边区，这是他过流放生活的第一次。读者将在这本书中看到，斯维尔德洛夫无论是在监狱里，还是在流放的地区，总是没有和外界隔绝。在监狱里，他不仅给皮尔姆的布尔什维克颁发指示，而且给革命政治犯组织学习小组。他还不断地努力进行自学，深刻地研究了马克思列宁主义的经典名著，并学会了德文法文……。无论是在什么场合，他同孟什维克和社会革命党人常常展开争论，把他们驳得哑口无言。所有这些都说明了这位伟大的青年革命家，虽然长期处在苦恼的监狱里和荒凉的流放区，但是他的革命精神是怎么也摧毁不了的。相反地，他能利用每一分钟时间，进行着对革命有益的事业。他写道：“我决不把精力浪费在闹情绪上面，我的精力会有另外一种最合理的用途。”
    这本书后面的三章生动而细致地描写了这位精力充沛的革命家在十月革命前夕的活动，表明了他能坚持不渝地执行党和列宁的正确路线以及相信人民的力量。当十月革命开始的时候，他还在土鲁汗斯克流放地。刚一被释放，他马上就来到了彼得堡投入斗争。七月事变后，列宁不得不暂时隐藏，斯维尔德洛夫在十分恶劣的环境里，和列宁的其他战友一道坚持列宁的路线，团结党和工人阶级队伍，力求迅速而准确地执行列宁的指示。
    我们在许多章节里，可以看到斯维尔德洛夫在工作中对待同志、对待劳动者既关心又亲切，而对待党和人民的敌人则毫不留情、毫不妥协。我们还可以看到他艰苦朴素的高尚品格。斯维尔德洛夫一生艰苦奋斗，不顾一切地为人民为社会主义革命而努力。直到他逝世的前夕，他还进行着紧张的工作。
    长期而艰苦斗争的锻炼使斯维尔德洛夫具有大革命家的一切优秀品质。列宁在1919年3月8日全俄中央执行委员会紧急会议上说：“雅·米·斯维尔德洛夫同志是革命者忠于自己事业的永恒象征，是冷静而熟练的处理实际工作、密切联系群众、善于领导群众的典范，是愈来愈多的无产者群众仿效这种范例、不断前进、达到世界共产主义革命彻底胜利的保证。”斯维尔德洛夫为我们树立了一个光辉的共产主义战士的榜样。
