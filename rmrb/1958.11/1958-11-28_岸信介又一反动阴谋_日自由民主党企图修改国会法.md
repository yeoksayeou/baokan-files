Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 27th: News from Tokyo: The Liberal Democratic Party's "National Diet Normalization" Countermeasures Committee, the ruling party of Japan, decided at its first meeting held on the 26th that the Liberal Democratic Party would study the revision of the "National Diet Law" and other issues in the future. This is another new conspiracy by the Kishi Nobusuke group to pave the way for the restoration of police terror rule and the march towards militarism.

In order to forcibly pass its "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill," the Kishi Nobusuke government disregarded the relevant provisions of the "National Diet Law" and the customs of the Diet. On November 4th, it used illegal means to extend the session of the extraordinary session of the Diet. This act of sabotage against Japanese parliamentary politics was resolutely opposed by the Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Japanese people inside and outside the Diet, which finally bankrupted its original conspiracy to pass the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" at the extraordinary session of the Diet. However, the Kishi Nobusuke group has not given up and is still attempting to submit the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" and the proposal on revising the Japan-US "Security Treaty" again at the ordinary session of the Diet. They are worried that this approach will inevitably be met with more intense opposition from the opposition parties and the Japanese people inside and outside the Diet.

Therefore, they are attempting to revise the "National Diet Law" under the pretext of "enabling the Diet to function normally." They are妄图 [wang tu - scheming] to restrict and deprive the legitimate rights granted to Diet members by the Japanese Constitution, making the Diet a tool entirely controlled by the Liberal Democratic Party and the Kishi Nobusuke government to approve their reactionary policies and anti-democratic bills.

The committee also decided to study measures to increase the authority of the Speaker and formulate specific plans to "eliminate violence inside and outside the Diet" in order to make it easier for the Kishi Nobusuke group's speaker to manipulate the deliberations of the Diet, and also to make it easier to use force to suppress the struggle of opposition party members and the Japanese people against the Kishi Nobusuke group.

    岸信介又一反动阴谋
    日自由民主党企图修改国会法
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本执政党自由民主党的“国会正常化”对策委员会在26日举行的第一次会议上决定，自由民主党今后要研究修改“国会法”等问题。这是岸信介集团为恢复警察恐怖统治和走向军国主义铺平道路的又一个新的阴谋。
    岸信介政府为了强行通过它的“警察官职务执行法修正案”，曾经不顾“国会法”的有关规定和国会惯例，在11月4日使用非法手段延长国会临时会议的会期。它的这一破坏日本议会政治的暴行，遭到了日本共产党、社会党和日本人民在国会内外的坚决反对，使它原来打算在国会临时会议上通过“警职法修正案”的阴谋终于破产。但是岸信介集团还没有死心，还企图在国会平时会议上再次提出“警职法修正案”和关于修改日美“安全条约”的提案，它们耽心这种做法必将在国会内外遭反对党和日本人民更加激烈的反对。
    因此，它们企图以“使国会正常地进行工作”为口实，修改“国会法”。妄图限制和剥夺日本宪法赋予国会议员的正当权利，使国会完全成为自由民主党和岸信介政府批准它们的反动政策和反民主法案的御用机关。
    这个委员会还决定：要研究提高议长职权的措施和拟订“排除国会内外的暴力”的具体方案，以便使岸信介集团的议长更易于操纵国会的审议工作，同时也更便于使用武力镇压反对党议员和日本人民反对岸信介集团的斗争。
