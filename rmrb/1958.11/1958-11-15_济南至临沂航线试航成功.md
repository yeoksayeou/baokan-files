    Jinan-Linyi Air Route Successfully Completes Trial Flight
  　(Reported by this newspaper) Shandong Province's first domestic civil aviation route, the Jinan-Linyi line, has successfully completed its trial flight.
    Due to the obstruction of mountains, transportation in the Linyi area is very inconvenient. The fastest trip from Linyi to Jinan takes more than a dozen hours, and the slowest takes two days. In winter and summer, traffic is often interrupted due to continuous rain and snow, preventing timely transport of goods such as grain, coal, local specialties, and medicinal materials. Now that the Jinan-Linyi line is open, flying from Linyi to Jinan only takes 1 hour and 20 minutes, greatly shortening the distance between the two places.

    济南至临沂航线试航成功
  　本报讯　山东省内第一条民用航空线——济（南）临（沂）线，试航成功。
    由于群山阻隔，临沂地区的交通很不方便。从临沂到济南，最快得十几个钟头，慢则两天，在冬夏两季常因雨雪连绵，交通中断，使这里的粮食、煤炭、土特产和药材等物资不能及时运出。如今，济（南）临（沂）线通航以后，在临沂乘飞机到济南，只需1小时20分钟，大大缩短了两地的距离。
