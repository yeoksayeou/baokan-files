The revolutionary base area of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region during the Anti-Japanese War—Danan Mountain in Lingqiu County, Yanbei region, has shown remarkable achievements in agricultural production this year, becoming the first "Thousand-Jin Mountain" for grain production per mu on the ancient Great Wall frontier.

This mountain stretches sixty li from north to south and eighty li from east to west, accounting for half of the total area of Lingqiu County, with a total of one hundred and ninety-six villages. The famous Battle of Pingxingguan took place here. After eight years of arduous resistance against the Japanese invaders, during which the enemy burned, killed, and plundered, this place was almost reduced to scorched earth. In addition, the land here is barren, with steep slopes and deep gullies. During the First Five-Year Plan, it suffered from disasters for four consecutive years. Although the Party and the People's Government repeatedly supported the development of production, progress was still very slow. For more than ten years, the output had not recovered to the pre-war level. In 1956, the annual income per person was still less than twenty yuan. Therefore, a situation of "annual grain shortage and yearly reliance on relief" had long been formed here.

However, the heroic people of the old revolutionary base area were not conquered by these unimaginable difficult conditions. Chairman Mao's inscription to them, "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," is always engraved in their hearts. In the first year of the Great Leap Forward, they used their hands, which had once made the enemy tremble with fear, to march and fight against nature. In just one year, they built more than 14,000 mu of terraced fields on the slopes near mountains and valleys, newly added more than 14,000 mu of irrigated land, and carried out many projects for flood prevention, drainage, and water and soil conservation. In implementing the "basic farmland" system, they shifted from planting multiple crops to fewer crops and from extensive farming to intensive farming, and unswervingly implemented the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture: water, fertilizer, soil, seed, close planting, pest control, management, and tools.

Recently, the remarkable achievements in the battle against nature have been announced here: 17,894 mu of grain fields produced more than 20 million jin of grain, equivalent to 2.73 times last year's yield, with an average yield of 1,187 jin per mu. People who have been worried about food and drink for generations have written a new page in the thousands of years of grain shortage history this year.

    雁北塞上千斤山
    抗日战争时期晋察冀边区革命根据地——雁北地区灵丘县大南山，今年农业生产上放出异彩，成为长城古塞上的第一座亩产粮食“千斤山”。
    这座山南北绵延六十里，东西长达八十里，占灵丘县总面积的一半，共有一百九十六个村庄。著名的平型关大战就发生在这里。八年的艰苦抗战，在敌寇烧杀摧残下，这里几乎成为一片焦土。加上这里土地瘠薄、坡陡沟深，第一个五年建设计划期间，连续四年遭灾，虽然党和人民政府一再扶持发展生产，但是发展仍然很慢，过去十多年产量一直没有恢复到战前水平，1956年每人全年收入还不到二十元。因此这里长期以来形成了“年年缺口粮、岁岁吃救济”的局面。
    但是，英雄的老区人民没有被这些难以想像的困难条件征服。毛主席赠他们的“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的题词，时刻铭在心头。大跃进第一年中，他们用自己曾使敌人心胆俱碎的双手，向大自然进军搏斗。仅仅一年时间他们在靠山傍沟的偏坡上，修好了一万四千多亩梯田，新增加一万四千多亩水地，并作了不少防涝排涝、保持水土工程。在贯彻“基本农田”制度中，多种变少种、粗作变精作，坚定不移地执行了水、肥、土、种、密、害、管、工八字“宪法”。
    最近，这里公布了向自然战斗取得的赫赫战果：一万七千八百九十四亩粮田，共产粮食二千多万斤，等于去年的二点七三倍，每亩平均产到一千一百八十七斤。祖祖辈辈愁吃愁喝的人们，今年在几千年的缺粮史册上写下了新的一页。
