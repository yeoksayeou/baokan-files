    "Civil and Military Officials" Should Enter the Account Now
  After the "Marshal" of Grain has taken command, the next step is how to ensure the comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production, including grain and various cash crops, and how to ensure the comprehensive leap forward in diverse economies, including agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. This is a new issue raised for future agricultural production by the great bumper harvest of grain.

    Facing the new situation in which the grain problem has been basically solved, many localities, when planning agricultural production for next year, have already paid attention to taking corresponding measures to expand the planting area of other cash crops and develop diverse economies, on the premise of ensuring a greater leap forward in grain. For example, Sichuan Province has already put the development of cash crops and diverse economies on the important agenda of leading agricultural production.

    One of the advantages of the People's Commune is the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. In the period when single agricultural production cooperatives existed, we also advocated the development of diverse economies, and diverse economies did indeed have some development. However, due to the relatively small scale and limited resources of agricultural cooperatives, and due to the existence of certain contradictions between the collective operation of cooperatives and the individual operation of cooperative members' families, the development of diverse economies could not but be restricted to some extent. Now the situation is different. The two major characteristics of the People's Commune, being large in scale and publicly owned, are precisely the greatest favorable conditions for accelerating the development of diverse economies. The People's Commune has more manpower, equipment, funds, and richer natural resources than agricultural cooperatives. The People's Commune can cultivate a large number of specialized talents needed for the development of diverse economies. Therefore, as long as the Party and government leading organs at all levels conscientiously implement the principle of "overall planning, strengthening leadership" put forward by Chairman Mao in the past, the superior system of the People's Commune will certainly exert great power in the development of diverse economies.

    Socialist and communist life is not only about making people full and warm, but also about eating well and dressing beautifully. To eat well and dress beautifully, it is not enough to have only grain and cotton. It is necessary to develop cash crops and diverse economies on the basis of greatly increasing grain production, and to achieve comprehensive development in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, cotton, hemp, silk, tea, oil, etc., and to develop them at the same high speed as grain production. If only the grain problem is solved, and the problem of cash crops and diverse economies is not solved, people can only eat their fill and keep warm, but cannot further improve and beautify their lives, and cannot fully demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system. Of course, a beautiful life cannot be achieved in the short term, but can only be gradually realized, but it must be put on the agenda.

    After the "Marshals" of steel and machinery have taken command, what follows will inevitably be the rapid development of light industry. To develop light industry, a large and sufficient supply of raw materials is needed. Where do the raw materials come from? They come from the rural development of cash crops and diverse economies. At the same time, many of the products of cash crop sideline production are export goods. Therefore, the development of cash crops and diverse economies can ensure the exchange of a large amount of foreign exchange and construction materials.

    Developing cash crops and diverse economies while developing grain production may be a bit difficult for some comrades who are accustomed to working in a single manner to adapt to or feel. Therefore, it is necessary for leaders at all levels to repeatedly explain the reasons and significance of doing so to the vast number of cadres, and to help them make arrangements in terms of production planning, labor, and technology.

    If grain, as a "Marshal," has already taken command, then it is now time for cotton, oil crops, sugar crops, tobacco, hemp, silk, tea, and other "civil and military officials" to enter the account.

### “文官武将”应该入帐了

    “文官武将”应该入帐了
  在粮食“元帅”升帐以后，下一步如何保证包括粮食和各种经济作物在内的农业生产的全面跃进，如何保证包括农业、林业、畜牧业、副业、渔业的多种经济的全面跃进，这是粮食大丰收给今后的农业生产提出的新课题。
    面对着粮食问题已经基本解决的新形势，许多地方在规划明年的农业生产时，已注意到采取相应的措施，在保证粮食更大跃进的前提下，相应地扩大其他经济作物种植面积，发展多种经济。如四川省就已经把发展经济作物和多种经济，提到领导农业生产的重要议事日程上来。
    人民公社的优越性之一，就是农、林、牧、副、渔业全面发展。在单一的农业生产合作社存在的时期，我们也曾提倡过发展多种经济，多种经济也确实有过某些发展。但是，由于农业合作社的规模比较狭小，资源有限，又由于合作社的集体经营跟社员家庭的个体经营之间存在着一定的矛盾，多种经济的发展不能不受到某种限制。现在情况不同了，人民公社的大和公的两大特点，恰恰正是加速发展多种经济的最大有利条件。人民公社比农业合作社拥有更多的人力、设备、资金和更丰富的自然资源，人民公社可以大量培养发展多种经济所需要的专门人材。因此，只要各级党政领导机关认真贯彻毛主席过去所提出的“全面规划，加强领导”的原则，人民公社这一优越的制度，一定会在发展多种经济方面发挥巨大的威力。
    社会主义和共产主义的生活不仅是使人吃饱穿暖，而且要吃得好穿得美。要做到吃得好穿得美，单有粮食、棉花是不行的，必须在大量增产粮食的基础上发展经济作物和多种经济，做到农、林、牧、副、渔、棉、麻、丝、茶、油等全面发展，而且要和粮食生产同样的高速度发展。如果只解决了粮食问题，而不解决经济作物和多种经济的问题，人们只能吃饱穿暖而不能更进一步改善生活、美化生活，就不能充分显示社会主义制度的优越性。当然，美好的生活不是短期就能达到的，只能逐步实现，但必须把它提到议事日程上来。
    在钢铁、机械两大“元帅”升帐以后，随之而来的必然是轻工业的飞跃发展。要发展轻工业，就需要大量的、充足的原料。原料从何而来？就要农村发展经济作物和多种经济。同时，在经济作物副业生产的产品中，有不少是出口物资，因此，发展经济作物和多种经济以后，可以保证换回大量外汇和建设物资。
    在发展粮食生产的同时发展经济作物和多种经济，在某些习惯于单打一工作的同志来说，也许一时还转不过弯来，或者是还感到有些困难。因此需要各级领导在广大干部中，反复讲明这样作的道理和意义，并且帮助他们在生产规划上、劳力上、技术上做好安排。
    如果说，作为“元帅”的粮食已经升帐，那么，现在已是使棉花、油料、糖料、烟、麻、丝、茶等“文官武将”入帐的时候了。
