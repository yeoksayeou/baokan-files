    Twenty Thousand People Smelt Copper on Zhongtiao Mountain
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Masses from six counties in Shanxi Province, including Xiyang, Jieyu, Yongji, Linyi, Mengxian, and Wutai, are vigorously engaged in indigenous copper smelting.

    In the Zhongtiao Mountain area, the more than 20,000-strong copper smelting army jointly formed by the three counties of Jieyu, Linyi, and Yongji created a record of producing 40,000 jin of crude copper per day on the 5th. At present, in addition to ensuring the normal production of the original 125 indigenous blast furnaces, they are rushing to build a batch of new furnaces. In the Taihang Mountain area, the copper smelting armies formed by members of the People's Communes of Mengxian and Xiyang counties have adopted the method of simultaneous prospecting, furnace construction, and smelting. In Xiyang County, a thousand-person mining army has opened more than seventy mines in just a few days, some of which have already been put into production. After a month of hard work, the staff and workers of the Mengxian Copper Factory have built a copper smelting plant with a daily output of two tons, which has been officially put into production.

    中条山上两万人炼铜
    新华社讯　山西省昔阳、解虞、永济、临猗、盂县、五台等六个县的群众，正在大搞土法炼铜。
    在中条山区里，解虞、临猗、永济三个县联合组成的两万多名炼铜大军，5日创造了日产粗铜四万斤的纪录。目前除保证使原有的一百二十五座土高炉正常生产外，正在突击修建一批新炉。在太行山区，盂县、昔阳两县各人民公社社员组成的炼铜大军，采取了边勘探、边建炉、边冶炼的方法。昔阳县一支千人采矿大军在短短的几天中，就开成七十多个矿井，部分已投入生产。盂县铜厂的职工经过一个月的苦战，已建成一座日产铜两吨的炼铜厂正式投入了生产。
