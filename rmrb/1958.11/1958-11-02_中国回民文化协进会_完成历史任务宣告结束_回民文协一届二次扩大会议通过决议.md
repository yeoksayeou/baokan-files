Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, 31st -- The China Islamic Cultural Association held its Second Enlarged Plenary Session of the First Committee from October 26th to 29th in Yinchuan, the capital of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. The meeting summarized the work of the past five and a half years and, after discussion, passed a resolution on the successful conclusion of the organization and work of the China Islamic Cultural Association.

The meeting was opened by Bai Shouyi, Vice Chairman of the China Islamic Cultural Association. Li Weidong, also a Vice Chairman, delivered a work report on the China Islamic Cultural Association's activities over the past five and a half years.

After discussion, the committee members and delegates unanimously agreed that when the China Islamic Cultural Association was established in May 1953, the economy and culture of the Hui people were relatively backward, the Hui people were scattered, and conditions were not yet in place to establish a provincial-level Hui autonomous region. Therefore, the Party's proposal to establish the China Islamic Cultural Association to assist the government in strengthening its work among the Hui people was timely and entirely correct. Over the past five years, under the leadership of the Party and with the direct assistance of the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission, the Islamic Cultural Association has publicized the Party's ethnic policies to the broad masses of Hui people, conducted patriotic and socialist ideological education among them, criticized local nationalism among the Hui people, enhanced unity within the ethnic group and among different ethnic groups, and assisted in resolving some ethnic and religious issues among the Hui people. This work has played a very positive role in uniting and educating the Hui people and promoting the development of their political, economic, and cultural endeavors.

The meeting concluded that ethnic regional autonomy policies have been implemented in all Hui-populated areas nationwide. Four Hui autonomous prefectures, nine Hui autonomous counties, and one joint Hui-other ethnic autonomous county have been established successively. Now, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has been established. This not only fully guarantees the Hui people's right to manage their internal affairs and be masters of their own affairs but also greatly inspires the Hui people's political enthusiasm to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. The new relationship of unity and fraternity established between the Hui people and all ethnic groups is being consolidated and continuously enhanced. After the successful completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production in urban and rural areas, the economic outlook of the Hui people has fundamentally improved. All of these circumstances indicate that the historical mission undertaken by the China Islamic Cultural Association has been completed.

The committee members and delegates unanimously supported the conclusion of the Islamic Cultural Association's organization and work.

    中国回民文化协进会
    完成历史任务宣告结束
    回民文协一届二次扩大会议通过决议
    据新华社银川31日电　中国回民文化协进会自10月26日到29日在宁夏回族自治区首府银川市召开第二届第二次（扩大）会议，总结了五年半来的工作，经过讨论，最后通过了关于胜利结束中国回民文化协进会组织和工作的决议。
    会议由中国回民文化协进会副主任白寿衣致开幕词，副主任李微冬作了中国回民文化协进会五年半来的工作报告。
    与会委员和代表经过讨论，一致认为1953年5月中国回民文化协进会成立的时候，当时回民的经济、文化比较落后，回族人民居住又很分散，并且建立省一级的回族自治区还没有条件，因此党提出成立中国回民文化协进会，协助政府加强回族工作，是非常适时和完全正确的。五年多来，回协在党的领导和中央民族事务委员会的直接帮助下，向广大回民群众宣传了党的民族政策，在回民中进行了爱国主义和社会主义的思想教育，批判了回民中的地方民族主义思想，增强了本民族内部和民族之间的团结；协助解决了回民中的一些民族、宗教问题等。这些工作对团结和教育回民，促进回民政治、经济和文化事业的发展，都起了很好的作用。
    会议认为：全国各个回民聚居地区，都已推行了民族区域自治政策，先后建立四个回族自治州、九个回族自治县、一个回族与其他民族联合的自治县，现在又成立了宁夏回族自治区。这不但充分保障了回民在管理本民族内部事务上当家作主的权利，而且大大激发了回族人民参加祖国社会主义建设的政治热情；回族人民和各民族间建立起来的团结友爱的新关系，正日益巩固和不断增进。城乡回民在胜利完成生产资料所有制的社会主义改造以后，经济面貌从根本上改善了，所有这些情况表明，中国回民文化协进会所担负的历史任务已经完成。
    与会委员和代表一致拥护结束回协的组织和工作。
