Khrushchev Laughs With Us
Yuan Shuipai

Hall of white marble brilliantly lit by ten thousand lamps [Note],
Walls ablaze with the names of ancient heroes in gold,
In a blaze of light, leaders come peacefully,
Faces familiar to people from all five continents.

Born a shepherd, worked as a fitter, handled a lathe,
Now, he firmly shoulders the burden of defending peace,
Smiling sincerely, like an old worker,
A warm wave of his hand, everyone rushes to his side.

Pushing aside the mountains and seas that separate us,
Asia, Africa, and the Soviet Union, arms linked, shoulders touching.
Oppressed people have found an unshakable pillar,
Black and yellow hands raise glasses in gratitude.

How well said! We will engrave it in our hearts:
"The highest praise is the hatred of the enemy."
"Human reason will surely conquer darkness."
These words contain the heart of fifteen hundred million people.

The divine land of China is blessed with the beauty of spring,
"Dark Africa" will soon dawn,
Flags of independence flutter everywhere,
A collapsed dam cannot stop the leaping tide!

Look! Mother October Revolution has children and grandchildren everywhere,
On the broad road of freedom and liberation, songs surge,
Hundreds of millions of people are filled with fighting spirit,
To send imperialism to its funeral!

[Note]: On October 22nd, Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders received Asian and African writers in the St. George Hall of the Kremlin. The walls of St. George's Hall have many marble plaques with the names of ancient Russian meritorious generals cast in gold.

    赫鲁晓夫和我们一起欢笑
    袁水拍万灯朗照白大理石的殿堂〔注〕，满墙交辉古代英雄的金榜，一片光明中领导人们安详地来到，五大洲人民早已熟悉的脸庞。牧童出身，当过钳工把过车床，如今，捍卫和平的担子稳挑肩上，真诚地微笑，就像个老工人模样，亲切的招手使大家一齐拥向他的身旁。把隔离我们的高山和大海都推开，亚洲、非洲和苏联臂儿相挽肩儿相挨。被压迫人民找到了永不动摇的支柱，黑色的、黄色的手举起了感谢的酒杯。说得多么好啊！我们将铭刻在心：“最高的褒奖是敌人的仇恨。”“人类的理性一定能把黑暗战胜。”这句话里有着十五亿人民的心声。神州大地春光好，“黑暗非洲”天将晓，独立的旗帜处处飘，塌堤难挡跃进潮！看！母亲十月革命子孙满堂，自由解放的大道上歌声浩荡，亿万人民斗志昂，要送帝国主义的丧！
   〔注〕：10月22日赫老和其他苏联领导人在克里姆林宫乔治堂接见亚非作家。乔治堂内四壁有许多大理石牌，上面铸有金的俄国古代立功将士的名字。    〔上海人民美术出版社供稿〕（附图片）
