Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, November 4th: According to Taiwan newspapers, the Legislative Yuan of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan is currently holding a meeting. After the release of the Chiang-Dulles talks communique, many legislators proposed inviting Huang Shao-gu, the "Foreign Minister" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and Ye Gongchao, the "Ambassador" to the United States, to attend the secret meeting of the "Legislative Yuan" to report on the recent diplomatic situation of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and answer the legislators' questions about their diplomatic policies. However, both Huang Shao-gu and Ye Gongchao avoided attending.

    Taipei's "Zhengxin News" reported that Taiwan legislator Wang Bao-xuan submitted a written inquiry on the "diplomatic policy" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique at the Legislative Yuan meeting on October 28th. He fiercely criticized the United States for treating the Taiwan authorities with methods such as "sacrificing allies," demanding that the Taiwan authorities not be subdued by the United States. Wang Bao-xuan expressed great dissatisfaction with Dulles' sacrifice of the Chiang Kai-shek clique for the benefit of the Republican Party, saying that the United States was "using the entire life-and-death issue of another ally as a tool for political struggle." Wang Bao-xuan said that the Chiang-Dulles talks communique fully demonstrated that the United States "disregarded the life and death of its allies" "at the most critical moment." He also called on the "diplomatic authorities" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique to "do their best to persuade the United States and not let the United States persuade them."

    "Zhengxin News" said that Wang Bao-xuan's speech, which was full of indignant emotions towards the United States, "seems to represent the voice of the majority" of Taiwan legislators. Its "analysis of the US-Chiang 'friendship'" "clearly has something to offer for deep thought."

    According to a Taipei dispatch published by the pro-Chiang "Hong Kong Commercial Daily" on the 2nd, after the release of the Chiang-Dulles talks communique, Taiwan's "colleagues in the press are all shaking their heads privately, but what is seen in (newspaper) commentary is still very subtle and reserved." Because "everyone understands the difficult situation of the government (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek clique)" and "cannot bear to expose this sad and indignant fact nakedly in front of readers," "so as not to discourage people too much." Therefore, if you look at the Taipei newspapers regarding the Taiwan authorities' "response to this matter, it is difficult to figure out the situation." But "everyone knows it in their hearts."

    不满美国把蒋介石集团当牺牲
    台湾立法委员大发怨言
    新华社香港4日电　据台湾报纸消息，台湾蒋介石集团立法院目前正在举行会议。蒋杜会谈公报发表后，许多立法委员都提出邀请蒋介石集团的“外交部长”黄少谷和驻美“大使”叶公超列席“立法院”的秘密会议，报告蒋介石集团的外交近情，并且答复立法委员们对他们进行的外交政策质询。但是，黄少谷和叶公超都避不参加。
    台北市“征信新闻”说，台湾的立法委员汪宝瑄在10月28日的立法院会议上，对蒋介石集团的“外交政策”提出了书面质询。他猛烈抨击美国以“牺牲盟友”等手段来对待台湾当局的做法，要求台湾当局不可被美国压服。汪宝瑄对杜勒斯为了共和党的利益而牺牲蒋介石集团表示十分不满，他说，美国是在“把另外一个盟友的整个生死关头的问题，拿来做政治斗争的工具”。汪宝瑄说，蒋杜会谈公报充分说明美国“在最紧要关头”的时候“不顾盟友的死活”。他还呼吁蒋介石集团的“外交当局”“必须全力说服美国，不可让美国说服”。
      “征信新闻”说，汪宝瑄这个对美国充满了愤慨情绪的发言，在台湾立法委员中“似能代表大多数人的心声”。它对美蒋“友谊的剖析”，“显有足资发人深省处”。
    另据香港亲蒋的“工商日报”2日发表的台北通讯说，蒋杜会谈公报发表后，台湾的“新闻界的同业们，无不在私下里大摇其头，但见诸（报纸）言论的，却仍然十分含蓄而且保留”。因为“大家明了政府（指蒋介石集团）处境的艰苦”，并且“不忍将这一令人悲愤的事实赤裸裸的放在读者们眼前”，“以免人心太沮丧”。所以，如果从台北报纸上看台湾当局“对此事的反应，是不大能摸得清行情的”。但是“大家的心里有数”。
