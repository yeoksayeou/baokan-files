    Conscientiously Learn from the Masses and Humbly Remold Oneself
    Teachers and Students of Two Departments of Jilin Normal University Gain Profound Enlightenment Through Labor Training

    (Our newspaper Changchun, 28th) Over six hundred students and teachers from the departments of Political Education and Education at Jilin Normal University have, since June of this year, gone down to over twenty cities and counties within Jilin Province for labor training and to participate in the local cultural revolution. Over the past five months, through practice, they have launched a revolution against bourgeois ideology and bourgeois educational theories.

    When they first went to the countryside, some teachers and students believed that the cultural revolution was a revolution by the working people to eliminate "ignorance," and therefore intellectuals were helping the masses in this struggle. Upon arriving in various locations, they prepared to give reports to local primary and secondary school teachers, advocating for the organization of lecture groups to travel around and spread culture. Some students called their organized club the "Cultural Seed Sowers Club," seemingly regarding themselves as intellectual enlighteners and bestowers of culture and education. However, in practice, the revolutionary drive and wisdom of the masses made them realize that they were the ones who truly needed to be enlightened and educated. In production labor, they witnessed a large number of creations and inventions by farmers in various places, as well as tool reforms, which deeply educated and moved them. During the drought resistance effort, farmers in Jiutai County created over a thousand poems in one night, making professors and university students realize that their knowledge and abilities were far less abundant than those of the working people. One professor said that he could not eat without meat, but before going to the countryside, he did not even know what feed was used to raise pigs. After students from the Education Department helped the Hejiang Township eliminate illiteracy, they established a spare-time school to organize continued learning for those who had become literate. When they asked Jin Fading, the secretary of the township Party committee, for a school name, the secretary said that "Red and Expert School" sounded brighter; the new people cultivated in the future would be both red and expert, capable in both literary and military skills, which would truly mean liberation. He repeatedly urged the university students that this was a matter of line. Township Party Secretary Jin Fa, who came from a hired peasant background and had only recently become literate, could use a few sentences to concisely and incisively point out the Party's educational policy, goals, and the nature of the cultural revolution. However, for several years, the teachers at Jilin Normal University had remained vague on these fundamental issues.

    In the practice of the cultural revolution, the teachers and students of the two departments criticized bourgeois academic thought. A psychology professor said in his ideological summary that after going to the countryside, he felt most ashamed that all the knowledge he taught his students for four hours a week in one academic year had not had any positive effect in the actual cultural revolution work they participated in, but instead had produced a lot of negative effects. A teacher who taught child psychology once described the psychological characteristics of the transition from adolescence to youth in class, saying: "It seems like something is missing, yet nothing is missing; emptiness, restlessness, a kind of indescribable need." But the facts were quite the opposite. In the practice of the cultural revolution, he saw that thousands upon thousands of young people and adolescents of the new China in Jiutai County participated in almost every central task, with high aspirations, daring to think and act, and moving forward courageously. In comparison, it was they themselves who felt empty, restless, and felt something was missing but could not say what it was. Practice has proven that in the past, psychology teaching not only failed to correctly explain the psychological essence of people in many places but also distorted the psychological essence of people, hindering students' correct analysis and understanding of people's psychological activities.

    In order to thoroughly eliminate the influence of bourgeois educational thought, all teachers and students of the Education Department recently concentrated on criticizing the bad influence of bourgeois psychology education within the department, remolding psychological science, and preparing to repeatedly observe the intense and colorful psychological changes of the people of the new China in political life and production labor in the future practice, summarize them, and find out scientific laws to make them closely serve production construction and class struggle, rather than observing the amount of saliva secreted by animals in dark rooms, and using the laws of dog's nerve activity to replace the laws of human psychological activity.

    认真学习群众　虚心改造自己
    吉林师范大学两系师生通过劳动锻炼得到深刻启示
    本报长春28日电　吉林师范大学政治教育和教育系的六百多名学生和教师，从今年6月先后下放到吉林省内二十多个市县进行劳动锻炼，并参加当地的文化革命工作。五个月来，他们通过实践，掀起一场对资产阶级思想和资产阶级教育学说的革命。
    初下乡时，有的师生认为文化革命是劳动人民革“无知”的命，因此知识分子在这个斗争中是帮助群众革命的。他们到达各地就准备给当地的中小学教师作报告，主张组织讲演团巡回讲学，传播文化。有的学生把自己组织起来的俱乐部叫做“文化播种人俱乐部”，俨然以思想启蒙者和文化教育赐与者自居。但是在实践中，群众的革命干劲和智慧，使他们领悟到自己才是真正需要被启蒙和被教育的。生产劳动中，他们看到各地农民大量的创造发明，改革工具，深受教育和感动。抗旱中，九台县农民一个晚上就创作一千多首诗歌，使教授和大学生们认识到他们的知识和才能，远不如劳动人民丰富。有个教授说，他没有肉吃不下饭，可是下乡之前，连猪是用什么食料喂养的也不知道。教育系学生协助加工河乡扫除文盲以后，为组织脱盲学员继续学习，建立了一所业余学校；当他们请示乡党委书记金发定校名时，书记说还是“红专学校”亮堂，将来培养出来的新人又红又专，能文能武，这才是真正翻身呢。他再三叮嘱大学生们说这是路线问题。乡党委书记金发是雇农出身，脱盲不久，能用几句话，简练、精辟地把党的教育方针、目的和文化革命性质一一点破。而吉林师范大学教师们，几年来对这些基本问题却一直是模糊的。
    两系师生在文化革命实践中，针对资产阶级的学术思想进行了批判。有一心理学教授在他的思想总结里说，下乡之后，使他感到最惭愧的是，他在一个学年里用每周四小时的时间教给学生们的全部知识，竟然在他们所参加的文化革命实际工作中，不能发生丝毫积极作用，反产生不少消极作用。一个教儿童心理学的教师曾在课堂上描绘过少年期向青年期过渡时的心理特征时说：“好像缺了点什么，又不缺少什么，空虚、烦躁，有一种说不出来的要求”。可是事实也恰恰相反。他在文化革命实践中，看到九台县全县成千上万的新中国青年、少年和青少年，几乎毫无例外地参加每项中心工作，志气昂扬，敢想敢做，勇往直前。相形之下，感到空虚、烦躁、缺少点什么又说不出来的是他们自己。在实践中证实，过去的心理学教学中，在很多地方不但没有正确地阐明人的心理本质，而且还歪曲了人们的心理本质，阻碍了学生们对人们心理活动的正确分析和认识。
    为了彻底清除资产阶级教育思想影响，教育系全体师生在最近集中批判了系内资产阶级心理学教育的坏影响，改造心理科学，准备在今后实践中，反复观察新中国人民在政治生活中和生产劳动中激烈、丰富多彩的心理变化，概括起来，寻出科学规律，使之密切地为生产建设和阶级斗争服务，不再是观察动物在暗室里唾液分泌的多寡，用狗的神经活动规律来代替人的心理活动规律。　　　　（王文琏）
