Comprehensively Arrange Labor Force to Vigorously Develop Diversified Operations
Liuyang, Hunan, Grasps Sideline Production, Working Less During Busy Farming Seasons and More During Slack Seasons

(Our Dispatch) The Party organizations at all levels in Liuyang County, Hunan Province, have fully utilized the superiority of the People's Communes, using methods of comprehensively arranging the labor force and organizing specialized teams to vigorously develop diversified operations. In October, with the overfulfillment of industrial and agricultural production tasks, sideline production also generated 16,070,000 yuan in cash. Each of the county's seventeen communes earned an average of 30,000 yuan per day, enough to pay three to five months' wages. In the first ten days of November, the total income from sideline production reached 6,100,000 yuan. This not only satisfied the need to improve the lives of commune members, but also laid the foundation for the great leap forward in industry and agriculture next year.

Liuyang County is famous for producing firecrackers, ramie cloth, and paper, and has a good foundation in sideline production. For several years, sideline production has accounted for about 50% of the total value of agricultural and sideline production. Since spring and summer this year, diversified operations have also been carried out well. However, for nearly a month from mid-September to early October, there was a stagnation in sideline production. Some factories stopped work, and no one engaged in some sideline occupations. The fundamental reason for this phenomenon was that many cadres believed that it was impossible to engage in sideline production under the tense conditions of industrial and agricultural production. Therefore, there was a period of laissez-faire, with no one leading sideline production.

In order to reverse this situation, the Liuyang County Party Committee took timely and effective measures. First, it launched a forum and debate among more than 700 county and commune leaders to deeply criticize the erroneous thinking of not valuing sideline production and believing that sideline production and industry and agriculture were contradictory. In order to prove with facts that as long as labor organization is well arranged, industry, agriculture, and sideline occupations can leap forward simultaneously, the county committee organized this group of cadres to visit the Global One People's Commune while holding the debate. The Global One Commune has 23,100 laborers, of whom they arranged 40% to engage in industry and 60% to engage in agriculture (10% of whom engaged in sideline production). In twenty days, the number of local iron smelting furnaces increased from one to fourteen, and the daily output of these furnaces also increased from 2,100 catties to seven or eight tons. In addition, they established eight larger factories such as chemical fertilizer and cement plants. They also achieved great results on the agricultural front, such as leading the county in fertilizer accumulation. At the same time, the commune also extracted 4,150 people to form professional teams for sideline production and diversified operations, with cash income reaching 125,000 yuan. Through the great debate and on-site visits, the cadres attending the meeting realized the relationship between industrial and agricultural production and sideline occupations, and realized that as long as the superiority of the People's Commune is fully utilized, labor can be rationally arranged and organized, and vigorous development of sideline production will not only not affect industry, but also strongly support industrial and agricultural production.

After the county solved the ideological problems of the cadres, the county committee immediately established a diversified operations committee, and determined that the deputy secretary of the county committee and the minister of finance and trade would be responsible for leadership. In addition to instructing each commune, brigade, and production team to strengthen the leadership of sideline occupations and diversified operations, it also drew 521 cadres from relevant departments to assist in organizing and researching sideline occupations and diversified operations production. Now, from the county to the production team, organizations for leading sideline occupations and diversified operations have been established separately. In the county's seventeen communes, thirty-four secretaries and ministers and one hundred and ninety-four deputy secretaries or deputy captains of general branches have been designated to specifically manage sideline production.

In order to solve the difficulties of labor and raw materials, the Party committees of each commune paid special attention to fully utilizing the favorable conditions of the People's Commune to further improve "three-izations" and carry out large-scale cooperation. Native paper and firecrackers are the county's most important sideline items, but in the past, there were great differences in the possession of raw materials between regions. Now, the problem of raw materials has been solved by carrying out large-scale cooperation between communes. For example, the three communes of Shangyou, Dongfeng, etc. in the eastern district have 276 paper mills, which are the main paper production areas in the county. However, the three communes of Hongqi, Qunli, etc. in the southern township make firecrackers in every household, but they have no paper, and disputes often arise over this matter in the past. However, the southern township produces coal, which can supply the eastern township with household and industrial coal. Now, through large-scale cooperation, the difficulties of each commune in the eastern and southern townships have been solved.

Now, a high tide of vigorously developing sideline occupations and diversified operations has formed throughout the county. The firecracker factories, native paper vats, native niter factories, and wineries that were once shut down have now all resumed production, and daily income can be increased by more than 20,000 yuan. Under the leadership of the Party committee, many new avenues for sideline occupations have now been discovered. Because the Dongfanghong Commune has found six major categories and one hundred and six sideline avenues, the total value of purchases and sales inside and outside the commune has now reached 1 million yuan, and the products sold to the state account for 480,000 yuan. There are already ten major categories and 584 kinds of sideline production avenues in the county. Recently, the county organized a team of nearly 10,000 people to go deep into the mountains and dense forests and found more than 700 kinds of useful wild plants. In order to adapt to the new situation after communization, the Liuyang County Party Committee is summarizing the basic experience of carrying out diversified operations under the new circumstances. This experience is: adopting the form of a large-scale regiment assault operation combined with a long-term fixed professional team to achieve less work during busy farming seasons, more work during slack seasons, and fierce work during seasons with strong seasonal characteristics. For example, when oil tea matures, the county will organize more than 50,000 people to pick all the oil tea seeds; at the same time, more than 3,000 people will be dispatched to rush to harvest ramie. For regular sideline production such as native paper and firecrackers, a long-term, fixed, trickle-down method is used to form more than 1,700 professional teams to engage in production.

Now, while formulating next year's industrial and agricultural leap forward plan, the county is also making a plan for sideline occupations and diversified operations. According to the plan, sideline occupations and diversified operations will increase by 1.75 times next year, accounting for 66% of the total value of agricultural and sideline production.

    全面安排劳力大搞多种经营
    湖南浏阳抓紧副业生产农忙小干农闲大干
    本报讯　湖南省浏阳县各级党组织充分发挥人民公社的优越性，用全面安排劳动力和组织专业队的办法，大搞多种经营。10月份，在工农业生产超额完成任务的情况下，副业生产也收入现金一千六百零七万元，全县十七个公社每个公社每天平均收入三万元，足够发三到五个月的工资。11月上旬，全县副业总收入又达到六百一十万元。这样，不仅满足了改善社员生活的需要，也为明年的工农业大跃进打下了基础。
    浏阳县素以出产鞭炮、夏布和纸张著名，副业生产很有基础。几年以来，在农副业总产值中，副业都占到50％左右。今年春夏以来，多种经营还开展得很好。但到9月中旬至10月上旬将近一个月时间内，曾经发生副业生产停滞的现象，有些工厂停工，有些副业没人搞。造成这种现象的根本原因，是很多干部认为在工农业生产紧张的情况下，没有办法再搞副业生产。因此，一度出现副业生产无人领导的放任自流现象。
    中共浏阳县委为了扭转这种局面，及时采取了有力的措施。首先在七百多名县、公社主要干部中开展鸣放辩论，深刻批判不重视副业生产和认为副业和工农业有矛盾的错误思想。为了用事实证明只要劳动组织安排好，工、农、副业可以同时跃进，在辩论的同时，县委就组织这批干部到全球一人民公社去参观。全球一公社有二万三千一百个劳力，他们安排了40％的人搞工业，60％的人搞农业（其中10％搞副业），在二十天的时间内，由一座土炼铁炉发展到十四座，这些土炉日产量也由二千一百斤提高到七、八吨。此外还办了化肥、水泥等八个较大的工厂。他们在农业战线上也取得了很大的战绩，比如积肥在全县领先。同时，这个社还抽出四千一百五十人组成了副业和多种经营专业队，现金收入达十二万五千元。通过大辩论和现场参观，到会干部都认识了工农业生产与副业的关系，认识了只要充分发挥人民公社的优越性，合理安排和组织劳力，大搞副业生产，不但不影响工业，也不影响农业，反而有力的支援工农业生产。
    这个县在解决干部思想问题后，县委会立即成立了多种经营委员会，确定了县委副书记和财贸部长负责领导。除指示各公社、大队、生产队加强对副业和多种经营的领导外，又从各有关部门抽调了五百二十一名干部协助组织和研究副业和多种经营生产。现在，从县到生产队都分别建立了领导副业和多种经营的机构。全县十七个公社，已确定三十四个书记、部长和一百九十四个总支副书记或副队长专管副业生产。
    为了解决劳力和原料的困难，各个公社的党委会都特别注意了充分发挥人民公社的有利条件，进一步搞好“三化”和开展大协作。土纸和鞭炮是这个县最主要的副业项目，但过去在地区之间原料占有的差别很大，现在公社与公社之间开展大协作，原料的问题就解决了。如东区的上游、东风等三个公社有二百七十六个纸厂，是全县的主要产纸区，可是，南乡的红旗、群力等三个社家家户户做鞭炮，却没有纸，过去经常为这件事闹纠纷。但南乡又出煤，可供给东乡家庭和工业用煤。现在，通过大协作，东乡和南乡各公社的困难都解决了。
    现在，全县已形成了大搞副业和多种经营的高潮。前一段一度停工的鞭炮厂、土纸槽、土硝厂、酿酒厂，现在都已全部恢复生产，每天可增加收入二万多元。在党委领导下，现在又发现很多新的副业门路，东方红公社由于找出了六大类、一百零六项副业门路，现在社内外购销总值达一百万元，卖给国家产品占四十八万元。全县已有十大类、五百八十四种副业生产门路。最近全县组织了近万人的队伍，深入深山密林，找到了有用的野生植物七百多种。为了适应公社化后的新形势，中共浏阳县委正在总结在新情况下开展多种经营的基本经验。这经验就是：采取了大兵团突击作战和专业队长期固定相结合的形式，达到农忙小干，农闲大干，季节性强烈的猛干。比如，在油茶成熟的时候，全县便组织了五万多人把油茶子全部采摘回来；同时还出动了三千多人突击收割黄麻。对土纸、鞭炮等经常性的副业生产就用长期固定、细水长流的方法，组成了一千七百多个专业队，从事生产。
    现在，全县在制订明年工农业跃进规划的同时，也作出了副业和多种经营的规划，按照规划，明年副业和多种经营将增加一点七五倍，占农副业总产值66％。
