Everything for the Diversion
By Our Correspondent Zhang Lijun

    November 20th marked the moment when the Three Gate Gorge project began to cut off the Yellow River.

    The diversion started with cutting off the Yellow River's main stream – the Shenmen River. A 120-meter-long and 15-meter-wide road, opened up on the right side of Guidao (Ghost Island), stretched directly to the Shenmen River; this was where the direct struggle with the Shenmen River took place.

    Guidao, with its peaks already shaved off, would be the main operational base for attacking the Shenmen River. Hundreds of fifteen-ton prefabricated concrete components were arranged here in dense layers. The diversion command post was set up on Guidao, facing the Shenmen River.

    Diversion is forcing the Yellow River to give way. After the diversion, what will appear before our eyes will no longer be the roaring Yellow River, but the helpless Yellow River, its neck pinched under our feet.

    In order to create conditions for the diversion, workers, starting from pouring the concrete cofferdam in late February this year, rushed to build a strong 427-meter-long waterproof line by the end of June. This line connected the Shendao (God Island) in the center of the torrent with the Zhanggongdao (Zhang Gong Island) downstream, splitting the Three Gate Gorge in half. This was the first time the Yellow River was forced to give way to half of the river valley according to people's will, ensuring the safe construction of the left bank foundation pit during this year's flood season. The main project of the left bank foundation pit – the comb teeth project of the spillway dam – is to arrange a new artificial path for the Yellow River.

    Many people building the Three Gate Gorge forgot to rest. What they considered was how to complete the task and conquer the Yellow River. The youth commando team led by Wang Jinxian, a wind drill operator and Communist Party member, was like this. Wherever the task was the most arduous, they went there. The more arduous the task, the more glorious they felt.

    The excavation of the foundation project of the pick-up dam, facing the Shenmen River, had its foundation in the quicksand of the shallows. During construction, the high water level outside pressured the quicksand to seep into the foundation pit. There were many holes, the size of teacups, through which sand poured in. The wind drill operators scooped the mud and sand out, but the seven-meter-deep foundation pit was always filled with silt. For a full half month, the Yellow River did not give in at all. The excavation project of the pick-up dam foundation remained unfinished.

    Wang Jinxian understood what it meant to fail to complete the task. This Zhanggongdao pick-up dam, downstream of the Shenmen River, may look like a small tail, but it controls the direction of the Yellow River water flow that will soon pour out from the comb teeth bottom holes, directly protecting the safety of the concrete manufacturing plant on the right bank and the steel bridge, an important transportation artery downstream. Therefore, whether the pick-up dam can be completed on schedule is related to the overall situation of the diversion. "Exposing the rock is victory," the wind drill operators launched a fierce battle against the silt.

    At the most critical moment, the youth commando team led by Wang Jinxian fought continuously for twenty-four hours without leaving the battlefield. At that time, the responsibility of the branch secretary was no longer how to boost morale for the battle, but to order everyone to rest. On the way back to the dormitory by car, everyone smiled at each other, because everyone, except for their two bright eyes, was covered in mud from head to toe.

    Everything was for the diversion, and also to create conditions for the comprehensive construction of the pouring project spanning the river next year. Everyone strived to do something for the diversion, and everyone asked to join the commando team and stand on the front line of conquering the Yellow River. Some said that if the front line wasn't possible, even washing clothes for the diversion fighters would be good.

    一切为了截流
    本报记者　张丽君
    11月20日，是三门峡工程开始切断黄河的时刻。
    截流是从切断黄河的主流——神门河开始的。一条在鬼岛右侧开辟出来的长一百二十公尺、宽十五公尺的公路一直伸展到神门河下，这里是和神门河直接搏斗的所在。
    已经削去山峰的鬼门岛将是进攻神门河的主要作战据点。成百个十五吨重的混凝土预制件在这里排列得密密层层。截流指挥台就设在鬼门岛上，面临着神门河。
    截流就是逼令黄河让路。截流以后，出现在我们眼前的将不再是咆哮的黄河，而是在我们跨下被人掐住脖子的无可奈何的黄河了。
    为了给截流创造条件，工人们从今年2月下旬浇筑混凝土围堰开始，到6月底就抢筑起一道四百二十七公尺长的强大的防水线，联结着激流中心的神岛和下游的张公岛，把三门峡劈成两半，第一次逼令黄河按照人们的意志让出半个河谷，保证了左岸基坑在今年汛期安全施工。左岸基坑的主要工程——溢流坝的梳齿工程，就是为黄河安排一条人为的新的道路。
    许许多多建设三门峡的人忘记了休息，他们所考虑的就是怎样完成任务，征服黄河。风钻手、共产党员王进先领导的青年突击队就是这样，哪里任务最艰巨，他们就到哪里去。任务越艰巨，他们感到越光荣。
    挑水坝基础工程的开挖，面临神门河，基础就是浅滩上的流砂。施工中，外面的高水位压迫着流砂向基坑渗透。茶杯大的口子向里灌砂的有好多个。风钻手们向外掏泥砂，可是七公尺左右深的基坑里，淤砂总是灌得满满的。整整半个月，黄河丝毫不让步。挑水坝基础的开挖工程始终未完成。
    王进先懂得完不成任务意味着什么。这个在神门河下游的张公岛挑水坝，看来像条小小的尾巴，它却控制着即将从梳齿底孔倾泻下来的黄河水流的方向，直接保护着右岸混凝土制造厂和下游的交通要道——钢桥的安全。所以，挑水坝能否按期完成，关系着截流大局。“要露出岩石来才是胜利”，风钻手们展开了一场和淤泥斗争的恶战。
    王进先领导的青年突击队在最紧张的关头连续战斗了二十四小时不下战场。当时支部书记的责任已经不是如何鼓足士气进行战斗，而是下命令要大家休息。在坐车回宿舍的路上，大家都相对笑开了，因为每个人除了两只亮晶晶的眼睛以外，从头到脚都成泥人了。
    一切为了截流，也为了明年横跨大河的浇筑工程创造全面施工的条件，谁都争取要为截流做点事情，大家都要求参加突击队，站在征服黄河的第一线。有的说，第一线不成，那怕为截流战士洗洗衣服都是好的。
