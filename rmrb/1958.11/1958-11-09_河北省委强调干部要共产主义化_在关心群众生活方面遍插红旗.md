According to the Hebei Daily, in the recent Great Leap Forward in production, Hebei Province has proposed ensuring that everyone eats well, sleeps well, rests well, and that children are well cared for, in order to truly combine work and rest and improve labor productivity. This issue was raised by the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China at a telephone conference held on November 5.

This telephone conference was presided over by Comrade Yan Dakai, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee.

He said at the meeting: All localities must earnestly grasp the three major life issues of the masses: rest, meals, and childcare. Regarding the issue of rest, it is necessary to ensure that the masses have eight hours of sleep a day, and four hours for meals, walking, and noon breaks. With good rest, labor efficiency can be greatly improved. Regarding the issue of meals, it is essential to run public canteens well, making the food varied, delicious, and without waste. From the county party committee down to the party branch of the team, the canteen issue should be discussed once a week to ensure it is run well. The main criteria for running a good public canteen should be that with the same amount of grain, oil, and vegetables, it feeds people more fully and better than if the commune members cooked separately, saving grain and coal, emphasizing hygiene, and making the commune members feel convenient and satisfied. Public canteens should give appropriate consideration to elderly commune members, children, the sick, postpartum women, and breastfeeding mothers in terms of diet, and can also establish separate canteens if necessary. Public canteens should have their own vegetable bases and should raise their own pigs, sheep, poultry, and grind their own tofu, etc., to continuously improve the food. Where possible, meals should be a mix of coarse and refined grains, with both porridge and dry food, and the dishes should be diverse, with both vegetables and soup, and the food should be improved regularly. Small shops can also be set up to prepare better dishes that commune members can buy with their own money. Hygiene in the canteens must be maintained. After the establishment of public canteens, township and commune cadres should no longer have their own canteens, but should participate in the commune-run canteens together with the commune members. Organizational leadership over the canteens should be strengthened. Cooks and staff should be appointed from among those who are politically progressive, healthy, thrifty and diligent, and enthusiastic about canteen work. Regarding childcare work, Comrade Yan Dakai pointed out that the standards for running nurseries and kindergartens are: to raise and educate children better than they would be at home, to ensure they are healthy, and to satisfy their parents. The establishment of nurseries and kindergartens should proceed from the convenience of commune members and the benefit of production, and one person should not look after too many children. Women's federations at all levels should earnestly take up this work.

Comrade Yan Dakai finally emphasized: To improve collective life, it is necessary to advocate that cadres go deep among the masses, care for the masses, share weal and woe with the masses, promote a democratic style of work, and that cadres should be communist-ized. Such outstanding cadres should be greatly commended. Red flags should be planted everywhere in improving the lives of the masses and improving the style of work of cadres.

    河北省委强调干部要共产主义化
    在关心群众生活方面遍插红旗
    据河北日报消息　河北省最近在生产大跃进中，为了真正做到劳逸结合，提高劳动生产率，提出要保证人人吃好、睡好、休息好、儿童教养好的问题。这个问题是中共河北省委在11月5日召开的电话会议上提出的。
    这次电话会议是由省委书记阎达开同志主持的。
    他在会议上说：群众的休息、吃饭、带孩子等三大生活问题，各地都要切实抓紧。关于休息问题，要保证群众一天有八小时的睡觉时间，吃饭、走路、中午休息共用四小时。休息好了，劳动效率更可大大提高。关于吃饭问题，一定要办好公共食堂，作到饭菜花样多，吃的好，不浪费。从县委直到队的党支部，要一周讨论一次食堂问题，保证办好。办好公共食堂的主要标准，应当是用同样多的粮、油、蔬菜，比社员分散做饭吃得饱，吃得好，节省粮食和煤炭，讲究卫生，使社员感到方便、满意。公共食堂对年老社员、儿童、病员、产妇、哺乳期的母亲，在饮食上应当适当照顾，必要时也可单独建立食堂。公共食堂要有自己的蔬菜基地，要自己养猪、养羊、养家禽、磨豆腐等，以不断改进伙食。在可能条件下，饭要粗细搭配，有稀有干，菜要多种多样，有菜有汤，定期改善伙食。还可设小卖部，准备较好的菜，社员自己出钱买。要搞好食堂的卫生。公共食堂建立后，乡社干部不应再有自己的食堂，要和社员一起参加社办的食堂。对食堂要加强组织领导。炊事员和工作人员应由政治进步、身体健康、克勤克俭、并热心于食堂工作的人担任。关于儿童福利工作，阎达开同志指出，办好托儿所、幼儿园的标准是：使儿童比在家里养得好，教得好，身体健康，父母满意。托儿所、幼儿园的建立要从便利社员、有利生产出发，不能由一人看过多的孩子。各级妇联应把这一工作切实抓起来。
    阎达开同志最后强调指出：要把集体生活搞好，就要提倡干部深入群众，关心群众，同群众共甘苦，发扬民主作风，干部要共产主义化。对于这样的优秀干部，应当大大表扬。在搞好群众生活方面和改进干部作风方面，都应当大插红旗。
