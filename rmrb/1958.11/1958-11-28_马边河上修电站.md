    Building a Power Station on the Mabian River
    The relatively large Xiaoshizi hydroelectric power station in Leshan Prefecture, Sichuan Province, is relying on indigenous methods to start full-scale construction ahead of schedule. The Xiaoshizi power station is on the Mabian River, only thirteen kilometers from its confluence with the Minjiang River.
    At present, the open channel project has been completed and is passing water, and the main structure is under full-scale construction. One-fifth of the work on the dam foundation of the barrage has been completed. According to calculations by engineering technicians, the concrete pouring task can be completed before the first flood season in March next year, and the entire dam line can reach the required height before the highest flood season in June next year. The open channel will be blocked during the river water recession phase in September, and the Mabian River's water power will be used to generate electricity.

    马边河上修电站
    四川省乐山专区规模较大的小什字水力发电站，正在依靠土法提前全面施工。小什字电站在马边河上，距离流入岷江的河口只有十三公里。
    现在，明渠工程已经完成和过水，主体工程已经全面施工，拦河坝坝基的工作量已完成五分之一。根据工程技术人员的计算，在明年3月第一个洪水期到来之前，便可完成混凝土灌浇任务，明年6月最高洪水期到来之前，大坝全线就能达到应有的高度，利用9月份河水下落阶段将明渠堵塞，马边河水力就要用来发电了。
