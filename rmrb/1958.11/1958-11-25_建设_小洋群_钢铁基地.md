　　Xinhua News Agency, Kunming. Yunnan Province's iron smelting industry is developing towards "small foreign clusters." The original temporary iron smelting sites will be developed into iron smelting plants and small-scale iron smelting bases.

　　Yunnan Province is rich in coal and iron resources, and most of them are relatively concentrated, which is convenient for large-scale mining and smelting. Therefore, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to arm the more than 10,000 small native furnace groups established in the province during the great leap in steel production with more advanced technology to build small-scale iron smelting bases. Based on the province's mineral resources, transportation, electricity, and technical strength, the Provincial Party Committee determined that the focus of construction should first be placed on Kunming, Gejiu, Rongfeng, Fuyuan, and Luoping, followed by the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture. Dali, Lijiang, Zhaotong, and other regions will also establish one to several small foreign furnace clusters as pilot projects. Next year, the province's pig iron production tasks will be mainly completed by small foreign furnace clusters.

　　At present, the largest "small foreign cluster" basic construction work has been launched in various places. More than 30 small foreign furnace clusters have been established in Kunming, Gejiu, Qujing, and Chuxiong, with a total blast furnace volume of 1,200 cubic meters. Mechanical workers throughout the province are working day and night to increase technical equipment for small foreign furnace clusters. More than 200 various types of blowers specially produced for small blast furnaces below 13 cubic meters have been shipped from the factory. Mechanical workers have also produced more than 100 gas generators and 750 kW steam turbines for areas lacking electricity, and are manufacturing 1,500 kW generators and 160 kW water turbines.

　　The small foreign furnace clusters that have been established produce iron of very good quality, all of which can be used for steelmaking, and about half of which can also be used for casting. These small foreign furnace production technologies are relatively easy to master, require less labor, and have a longer furnace life.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanning. Under the assistance of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry of the Central Government, Luzhai County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is building a small-scale iron and steel complex combining indigenous and foreign methods, with iron smelting, steelmaking, and steel rolling equipment. This is the precursor to Guangxi's steel industry moving from "small, indigenous, and mass" to "small, foreign, and mass."

　　This iron and steel complex is being built in the Hero People's Commune in the Yingshan area of ​​Luzhai County. The commune currently has 48 native blast furnaces, producing more than 20 tons of pig iron per day. According to the plan, the commune will add 15 blast furnaces with a volume of 6 to 8 cubic meters, and two have already been built. In terms of steelmaking, 8 to 10 puddling furnaces will be built first, and 7 have already been built, and then small converters will be used instead. In terms of steel rolling, factory buildings are currently under construction. A 180 mm steel rolling mill with an annual output of 2,000 tons and a wire drawing machine with an annual output of 250 tons can be installed by the end of November.

　　Yingshan Shanwan has a wide site and is close to raw material and fuel production areas. There are abundant iron ore and hydropower resources for power generation within three kilometers. The highways here extend in all directions and are close to the Xianggui Railway, making transportation very convenient.

　　After the iron and steel complex is completed, it can produce a large number of small round steel, square steel, flat steel, and shovel plates, steel wire ropes, etc.

　　Our newspaper, Tianjin, 24th. The No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant in Zhuoxian County is moving from a "small indigenous cluster" to a "small foreign cluster." Now, 16 small blast furnaces in the factory have achieved mechanical and semi-mechanical operation. The efficiency of workers has been greatly improved. From the 8th to the 18th, in ten days, the number of iron smelting workers decreased by six-sevenths compared with the same period last month, and the daily output of pig iron increased by more than four times, and the quality has also been significantly improved.

　　This iron and steel plant was established on the basis of scattered "small indigenous clusters" of office cadres, workers, people's communes, and schools. Although the factory implemented a factory management system after five determinations (determining the location, furnace type, personnel, group, and leadership) during the construction process, it consumed a lot of labor due to the lack of mechanical equipment. In response to this situation, the Zhuoxian County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed: rely on our own efforts to make mechanical equipment to arm ourselves and move from "small indigenous clusters" to mechanized production. After mass deliberation and discussion, a tool reform movement centered on mechanical operation was quickly launched. Workers adopted methods such as imitation and creation, and used self-made indigenous machines, hand files, and other tools to manufacture 2.8 kW electric motors, 100 kVA high-voltage transformers, ore crushers, blowers, hand-cranked and electric winches, and automatic feeding machines for small blast furnaces. This enabled the 16 small blast furnaces with volumes of 6.5 cubic meters and 13 cubic meters to operate mechanically or semi-mechanically in production processes from ore crushing to feeding. Most of the sand casting type indigenous iron smelting furnaces were changed to electric blower production. From the 8th to the 18th, the number of iron smelting workers in this factory decreased by more than 19,000 compared with the same period in October, and the average daily output of iron reached 203 tons, an increase of more than three times, all of which were first- and second-class good pig iron. At present, the employees of the factory's motor factory have also proposed to produce 500 kVA transformers and 75-horsepower generators to gradually move small blast furnace production towards "electrified" production.

    建设“小洋群”钢铁基地
    云南用先进技术武装小土炉
    鹿寨建设小型钢铁联合企业
    涿县实行机械化产量增四倍
    新华社昆明电　云南省的炼铁工业正在向“小洋群”发展，原来临时性的炼铁现场将发展成为炼铁厂和小型炼铁基地。
    云南省煤铁资源丰富，而且大部分比较集中，便于大规模地开采和冶炼。因此，中共云南省委决定将全省在大办钢铁中建立的一万多个小土炉群，用比较先进的技术武装起来，建成小型炼铁基地。省委根据全省矿产、交通、电力和技术力量等情况，确定先将建设重点摆在昆明、个旧、榕峰、富源和罗平等市县，其次是楚雄彝族自治州。大理、丽江、昭通等地区也都建立一个到几个小洋炉群作为试点。明年全省生铁的生产任务就将主要由小洋炉群来完成。
    目前，规模最大的“小洋群”基本建设工作已在各地展开。昆明、个旧、曲靖和楚雄已有三十多个小洋炉群建立起来，高炉容积共达一千二百立方公尺。全省机械工人正在为小洋炉群增加技术装备日夜奋战。专为十三立方公尺以下的小高炉生产的二百多台各种型号的鼓风机，已经出厂。机械工人还为缺乏电力的地区生产了一百多台煤气机和七百五十瓩的汽轮机，正在制造的有一千五百瓩的发电机和一百六十瓩的水轮机等。
    已经建立起来的小洋炉群，所产生铁质量很好，都能炼钢，其中一半左右还能铸造。这些小洋炉生产技术比较容易掌握，所需劳力少，炉龄也比较长。
    新华社南宁电　广西僮族自治区鹿寨县在中央冶金工业部协助下，正在建设一个拥有炼铁、炼钢、轧钢设备的土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业。这是广西钢铁工业由“小、土、群”向“小、洋、群”迈进的先声。
    这个钢铁联合企业建设在鹿寨县英山地方的英雄人民公社。这个公社现有土高炉四十八座，日产生铁二十多吨。按照计划，公社要增建六到八立方公尺的高炉十五座，现已建成两座；炼钢方面将先建立八到十座炒钢炉，现已建成七座，以后再换用小转炉；在轧钢方面，目前正在建造厂房，年产二千吨的一百八十公厘轧钢机和年产二百五十吨的拉丝机，在11月底就可以安装完毕。
    英山山湾场地宽阔，接近原料、燃料产地。在三公里以外的地方，就有丰富的铁矿和可供发电的水力资源。这里公路四通八达，又临近湘桂铁路，交通也很方便。
    这个钢铁联合企业建成以后，可以大量生产小型圆钢、方钢、扁钢和铁锹板，钢丝绳等。
    本报天津24日电　涿县第一钢铁厂正在由“小土群”向“小洋群”迈进。现在，这个厂已有十六座小高炉实现了机械和半机械操作；工人生产效率大大提高，从8日到18日十天中，炼铁人数比上月同期减少了七分之六，生铁日产量提高了四倍多，质量也有显著提高。
    这个钢铁厂是在机关干部、工人、人民公社、学校等分散的“小土群”基础上建立起来的。在建厂过程中，虽然经过五定（定点、定炉型、定员、定组、定领导），推行了工厂化管理制度。但是由于缺乏机械设备，花费劳动力很大。中共涿县县委针对这一情况，提出：自力更生制机械设备武装自己，从“小土群”走向机械化生产。经过群众酝酿和讨论，一个以操作机械化为中心的工具改革运动很快就开展起来了。工人们采取模仿、创造等方法，用自己制造的土机器、手锉等工具，制造出二点八瓩电动机、一百千伏安高压变压器、矿石破碎机、鼓风机、手摇和电动卷扬机和小高炉自动上料等机械。使十六座容积六点五公尺、十三公尺的小高炉，从矿石破碎到上料等生产过程操作机械或半机械化。大部分翻砂炉式的土炼铁炉改为电动鼓风机生产。从8日到18日，这个厂炼铁工人比10月同期减少了一万九千多人，铁的平均日产量达到二百零三吨，提高了三倍多，全部都是一、二类好生铁。目前，这个厂的电机厂职工又提出生产五百千伏安变压器和七十五马力的发电机，使小高炉生产逐渐走向“电气化”生产。
