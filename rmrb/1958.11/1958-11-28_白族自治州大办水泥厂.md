    Bai Autonomous Prefecture Vigorously Develops Cement Plants
    The Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province has built twenty-three cement plants, manufacturing cement using indigenous methods. Since September, they have produced over 1,100 tons of cement, including a portion of high-grade cement above grade 400.
    The Xiaguan Cement Plant utilized a modified lime kiln to produce grade 400 cement and also developed a set of indigenous methods for testing cement quality. The Wutai Township Cement Plant in Dali County and the Xiangyun County Cement Plant, staffed by only a few workers experienced in firing bricks, tiles, and lime, also overcame numerous difficulties and produced cement above grade 400 using indigenous methods. The Wutai Township Cement Plant has grown from a small factory established with 180 yuan to a factory producing ten tons of grade 400 cement per day. Various counties, key engineering project townships, people's communes, and commercial departments have also successively established cement plants.

    白族自治州大办水泥厂
    云南省大理白族自治州建起了二十三个水泥厂，用土法制造水泥。9月份以来已经生产了一千一百多吨水泥，其中包括一部分四百号以上的高标号水泥。
    下关水泥厂利用改装了的石灰窑烧出了四百号水泥，并且创造出一套土法鉴定水泥质量的经验。大理县五台乡水泥厂和祥云县水泥厂，只有几个会烧砖瓦石灰的工人，他们也战胜了重重困难，用土法造出了四百号以上的水泥。五台乡水泥厂已经由一个花了一百八十元建立起来的小厂，发展到日产十吨四百号水泥的工厂。各县和重点工程的乡、人民公社、商业部门也都陆续开办了水泥厂。
