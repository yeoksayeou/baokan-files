(Dispatch from this newspaper) According to the Bulgarian "Workers' Affairs Newspaper" on November 2nd: Todor Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, recently, in answering questions raised by Pécz Ferenc, a reporter from the Hungarian "People's Freedom Newspaper," elaborated on Bulgaria's mass movement to complete the Third Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and the issue of anti-revisionism.

Zhivkov said that the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party held in June of this year marked the beginning of a new stage in Bulgaria's development. In this stage, the Bulgarian people will strive to fully build a socialist society and create the necessary material, technical, economic, and ideological conditions for the transition to communism.

He said that under the leadership of the Party, the Bulgarian people have displayed great creativity and vigor in striving to realize the construction program adopted by the Party Congress. The production plan has now been greatly overfulfilled. Based on the enthusiasm and aspirations of the people throughout the country, the Party Central Committee, at its October plenary session, put forward the slogan of accelerating the pace of economic development and completing the economic tasks set by the Party's Seventh Congress ahead of schedule. The people of the country responded to the Party's call and launched a national movement to strive to complete the Third Five-Year Plan in three to four years. Its purpose is to: fully unleash the potential in industry and agriculture, redefine production speed, targets, norms, and methods, innovate technology, further save raw materials and power, merge agricultural production cooperatives and make the most rational use of land, greatly expand soil improvement projects, increase industrial and agricultural output, reduce costs, and improve quality.

Zhivkov said that under the leadership of the Communist Party, this national movement to strive to complete economic tasks ahead of schedule is growing larger and larger. He said, we are deeply convinced that the people of our country, united as one around the Communist Party and the People's Government, relying on comprehensive cooperation and fraternal mutual assistance with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries, will certainly be able to victoriously complete this great task and make more contributions to strengthening the common cause of the socialist camp.

When talking about the issue of opposing revisionism, Zhivkov said that the Bulgarian Communist Party is one of the historical and revolutionary Marxist parties. From the first few years of its establishment, it has waged an irreconcilable struggle against manifestations of revisionism and attempts to revise Marxism-Leninism. The Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party approved the timely and resolute measures taken by the Party Central Committee to oppose petty-bourgeois laxity and certain attempts to revise our policy based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. The Party Congress, proceeding from a highly principled Marxist-Leninist standpoint, unanimously condemned the revisionism of the current Yugoslav leaders.

Zhivkov pointed out that now, the increasingly fierce class struggle is unfolding on the international stage. This situation requires communists to be ideologically and politically firm, confident, and unwavering, to resolutely defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and to more forcefully strengthen international unity. We believe that raising the Marxist-Leninist level of all our party cadres and all party members is one of the main conditions for victoriously conducting the struggle against revisionist fallacies. Therefore, our Party is strengthening the work of improving the ideological training and Marxist-Leninist cultivation of Bulgarian communists.

He said: "Our Party is strengthening ideological work in the spirit of the declaration of the Moscow meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties in November 1957 and the spirit of the resolutions of the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party. At the center of our ideological work is: correctly clarifying international issues, and educating the people in the spirit of unshakable Bulgarian-Soviet friendship, in the spirit of unlimited loyalty to the socialist camp, and loyalty to the cause of peace and socialism."

Zhivkov pointed out that today, the Party's entire propaganda and agitation work is striving to integrate with the people's lives, socialist construction, the international workers' movement, and the communist movement. The Bulgarian Communist Party has more favorable international and domestic conditions for carrying out a more active offensive against bourgeois political ideology on the entire ideological front.

    日夫科夫谈保加利亚经济发展
    展开全民运动　加快建设速度
    保共加强思想工作坚决反对修正主义
    本报讯　据保加利亚“工人事业报”11月2日报道：保加利亚共产党中央委员会第一书记日夫科夫最近在答匈牙利“人民自由报”记者佩茨·费伦茨所提的问题时，阐述了保加利亚开展提前完成第三个五年计划的群众运动和反修正主义问题。
    日夫科夫说，今年6月举行的保共第七次代表大会标志着保加利亚发展的新阶段的开端。在这个阶段中，保加利亚人民要为完全建成社会主义社会并创造向共产主义过渡的必要的物质、技术、经济和思想条件而努力。
    他说，保加利亚人民在党的领导下，发挥了极大的创造性和干劲为实现党代表大会通过的建设纲领而奋斗。生产计划现已大大超额完成了。党中央根据全国人民的积极性和愿望，在10月全会上提出了加快经济发展的速度、提前完成党第七次代表大会所提出的经济任务的口号。全国人民响应了党的号召，掀起了争取在三、四年内完成第三个五年计划的全民运动。它的目的是：充分发挥工农业中的潜力，重新确定生产的速度、指标、定额和方法，革新技术，进一步节约原料和动力，合并农业生产合作社和最合理地使用土地，大大地扩大土壤改良工程，增加工农业产量，降低成本，改进质量。
    日夫科夫说，在共产党的领导下，这个争取提前完成经济任务的全民运动规模越来越大。他说，我们深信，一致团结在共产党和人民政府周围的我国人民，依靠同苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家的全面合作和兄弟般的互助，一定能够胜利的完成这个伟大的任务，为加强社会主义阵营的共同事业作出更多的贡献。
    在谈到反对修正主义的问题时，日夫科夫说，保加利亚共产党是历史悠久的、革命的马克思主义政党之一。从它成立的头几年起，它就同修正主义的表现、同修正马克思列宁主义的企图作了不调和的斗争。保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会赞同了党中央委员会为反对小资产阶级的散漫性、反对某些修正我们以马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则为基础的政策的企图，所及时采取的坚决措施。党的代表大会从具有高度原则性的马克思列宁主义立场出发，一致谴责了目前南斯拉夫领导人的修正主义。
    日夫科夫指出，现在，在国际舞台上展开了日益剧烈的阶级斗争，这种情况要求共产党人在思想上、政治上要坚定，要有信心和毫不动摇，要求他们坚决地捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，更加有力地加强国际团结。我们认为，提高我们全党干部和全体党员的马克思列宁主义修养，是胜利进行反对修正主义谬论的斗争的主要条件之一。因此，我们的党正在加强提高保加利亚共产党员思想锻炼和马克思列宁主义修养方面的工作。
    他说：“我们党正根据1957年11月共产党和工人党莫斯科代表会议宣言的精神和保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会的决议的精神来加强思想工作。在我们的思想工作中占中心地位的是：正确地阐明国际问题，以不可动摇的保苏友谊的精神、以无限忠于社会主义阵营、忠于和平和社会主义事业的精神教育人民。”
    日夫科夫指出，今天，党的整个宣传鼓动工作正努力与人民生活、社会主义建设、国际工人运动和共产主义运动结合起来。保加利亚共产党在整个思想战线上对资产阶级政治思想进行更积极的进攻，这已具备了有利的国际和国内条件。
