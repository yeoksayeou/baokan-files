    Commune's Rest Day
    By our reporters Yang Yi, Wu Zanting

    On the morning of the 4th, braving the drizzle, we went to the Yuejin People's Commune in the southern suburbs of Taiyuan. The fields were quiet everywhere, but the scene was completely different when we entered the village. Loud songs came from the loudspeakers, red lanterns hung high at the entrance of the commune, and the cooks in the canteen were busy washing lotus roots and cutting meat, as if they were celebrating a happy event. The commune members told us: "After several days of hard work, the whole commune will have a complete rest today." So, we also spent a holiday with them.

    On this day, every household lit their stoves, cleaned their toilets, washed clothes, and went to bathhouses and barbershops specially set up for them to take baths and get haircuts. Household chores that had been neglected for a long time were taken care of today. The homes of the commune members we visited were all clean and tidy, and the whole family gathered together, full of joy. Zhang Sanhe, a commune member who maintained the title of model in previous assessments, and another commune member created a record of digging more than two mu of paddy fields in one day a few days ago. Today, during the holiday, he automatically dug lotus roots for the commune and hauled five loads of manure after returning home, working for half a day. In another household, we saw the commune members who had worked hard last night sleeping soundly. In order to let the commune members enjoy the holiday, the commune also gave each commune member who participated in the labor some pocket money today.

    When it was time for dinner, the loudspeakers made a loud sound, constantly calling people from all directions. As soon as the broadcast ended, the canteen became lively. The children ran in the front, followed by male and female commune members pouring into the canteen from all directions. The spacious dining hall was suddenly full of seats, filled with joy. Those who liked to drink and those who wanted to eat found their own partners, eight people at a table. There were large bowls of dishes, including the local specialty of snow-white and crisp cold lotus root slices, savory and fragrant diced meat mixed with green beans, vermicelli stewed with pork with both vegetables and soup, etc. Bowl after bowl of dishes, pot after pot of wine, guessing fingers and giving orders, talking and laughing, many people drank until their faces turned red, and only when hot meat dumplings were served did people's interest shift from drinking. Old commune member Zhang Guoxian told reporters: "The commune stipulates that there will be small improvements in food every ten days and major improvements every month; usually everyone sleeps for eight hours, and there will be three days of public holiday every month. Such a life, I could never have dreamed of in the past!"

    Today, the club was also very lively. The deputy director of the club cleaned the library early in the morning to prepare for the commune members to read. Elderly people who love chess remained around the table. Young "poker" enthusiasts were competing, class after class, which was considered enough to satisfy their "addiction." The singing team was teaching songs; the writing group, which loves writing, also started activities. Commune members near Fenhe Dongzhuang also joined together to fish in the river. In the evening, the "Satellite" basketball team and the "May Fourth" basketball team played a friendly basketball match. As soon as it got dark, a screen was hung on the ancient stage to show movies for the commune members.

    It was late at night, and the commune members were already resting. At this time, the cadres of the commune headquarters were summarizing the results of the previous few days and formulating plans for the next stage of hard work. So far, all the more than 8,500 mu of rice in the commune have been brought to the threshing ground, and a field army of more than 1,000 people has deeply plowed more than 2,700 mu of paddy fields in three days, releasing a high-yield satellite of plowing 2,000 mu per day yesterday. In this battle, more than 100 advanced individuals who worked selflessly emerged. After the red flags were planted for them, the commune cadres rearranged the forces for digging the land, delivering fertilizer, and threshing in the second half of the month.

    公社的休息日
    本报记者　杨义　武赞庭
    4日早晨，冒着毛毛细雨，我们去到太原市南郊跃进人民公社。田地里到处是静悄悄的，但走进村子，景象完全不同。喇叭筒里传出嘹亮的歌声，公社大门红灯高挂，食堂里炊事员正忙着洗藕、切肉，好像是在办喜事。社员们告诉我们说：“连续苦战了几天，今天全社大歇工。”这样，我们也就和他们一起欢度了一个假日。
    这一天，家家户户盘火炉，掏厕所，洗衣服，并到专为他们设置的澡塘、理发馆洗澡理发。长期以来无暇处理的家务事，今天得到了安排。我们访问过的社员家庭，都收拾得一干二净，全家大小欢聚，喜气融融。历次评比中保持模范称号的社员张三和，前几天和另一个社员创造了一天挖二亩多稻地的纪录，今天，在假日里还自动给社里挖藕，回家又掏了五担粪，劳动了半晌。在另一家，我们看到昨夜苦战的社员们正睡的很香。公社为了让社员愉快地过假日，今天还给每个参加劳动的社员发了一些零花钱。
    到开饭的时候，喇叭筒发出宏亮的声音，不断招呼各处的人。广播声刚一落，食堂就热闹起来了。孩子们跑在最前面，接着男女社员们从四面八方涌向食堂。宽敞的饭厅里顿时满座，喜气洋洋。好喝酒的，愿吃饭的，自找对象，八个人一桌。大碗菜有当地名产雪白清脆的凉拌藕片，色美味香的肉丁拌青豆，有菜有汤的粉条烩猪肉等等，菜一碗顶一碗，酒一壶接一壶，猜拳行令，有说有笑，许多人喝得涨红了脸，直到端上热呼呼的肉馅饺子才转移了人们的酒兴。老社员张国贤告诉记者说：“社里规定，伙食十天小改善，一月大改善；平常大家睡八小时，一个月还要放三天公假。这样的生活，过去真是做梦也梦不到！”
    今天俱乐部也十分热闹。俱乐部副主任一清早就把图书室打扫干净，准备社员阅览。爱好象棋的老年人一直围桌不散。青年“扑克”迷在比赛，一班接着一班，可算过足了“瘾”。歌唱队教着歌；爱好写作的创作组也展开了活动。靠近汾河东庄的社员们，还结合起来到河里捕鱼。傍晚，“卫星”篮球队和“五四”篮球队作了一场篮球友谊赛。天一黑，在古老的戏台上挂起银幕，为社员们放起了电影。
    夜深了，社员们已经休息了。这时公社指挥部干部正汇总前几天的战果和制定下一步的苦干计划。到目前为止，全社八千五百多亩稻谷已全部上了场，一千多人的野战团三天深翻稻田二千七百多亩，昨日放出了日翻二千亩的高产卫星。在这场战斗中，涌现了一百多个忘我劳动的先进人物。给他们插了红旗以后，社干部又重新布置了下旬挖地、送肥、打场的力量。
