Xinhua News Agency, 23rd Dispatch: In mid-November, China's steel production took another significant step towards the goal of 10.7 million tons. By the 20th, national steel production had reached 8,925,035 tons, accounting for 83.4% of the annual production plan. Currently, tens of millions of iron and steel workers are continuing to vigorously tackle quality issues, rolling the produced steel into more high-quality steel products to meet the needs of national construction. Eighteen key enterprises have already begun to transition to a stage of simultaneously focusing on steel and steel products, output and quality. The "small indigenous groups" smelting steel movement in various provinces and regions is also making every effort to improve the quality of pig iron, transferring good iron to support the production of key enterprises.

In this ten-day period, the national daily steel production level continued to steadily increase. From November 11th to 20th, the average daily steel production was 91,800 tons, an increase of more than 16% compared to the first ten days of November.

In this ten-day period, the output of both steel and steel products increased in various key enterprises compared to the past. Steel increased by 12.5% compared to the first ten days of the month, and steel products increased by 5.7%. Many enterprises are fighting against pig iron with high sulfur content. The simple iron-melting furnace recently created by Shanghai steelworkers can reduce the sulfur content of pig iron from over 1.2% to below 0.3%, which greatly helps to improve the quality of steel. After joint efforts by technicians and workers of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, with the personal participation of the Party Secretary in experiments, they have basically mastered the rules of using indigenous iron to make steel. Due to the large-scale use of indigenous iron from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces, the output in mid-November increased by 19% compared to the first ten days of the month in various steel plants.

In terms of steel product production, various enterprises are actively taking measures to launch a mass technological innovation movement, striving to leap forward in the rolling production level in a short period of time. The installation projects of some new rolling mills, which had been relaxed in the previous period due to concentrating efforts on steel production, now have dedicated personnel responsible for rapid installation and are preparing to be put into production successively soon.

In order to support the production of key enterprises, the high tide of producing good iron and transferring good iron launched in various places is continuing to develop. Since the beginning of November, a transportation network for rushing pig iron has been formed throughout the country. On the large and small roads leading to railways and highways, vehicles are bustling and endless. In Hunan Province alone, 537,000 ox carts, horse carts, and automobiles were mobilized to rush pig iron. The staff on various transportation lines also put forward the slogan "Let iron go first," transporting the pig iron scattered in various places to Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing, and other places day and night. According to statistics from twelve provinces and regions including Henan, Anhui, and Hunan, as of the 20th, more than 270,000 tons of pig iron had been shipped out this month. In many provinces, Party secretaries at all levels are personally responsible for deploying and inspecting the task of outward transfer, and have established acceptance stations where unqualified pig iron is not allowed to be transferred out. In order to ensure that all the pig iron transferred out is good iron, Guangxi, Shandong, and other provinces and regions would rather smelt less steel themselves, or re-smelt the inferior iron, and therefore have won the praise of workers in steel plants in Shanghai and other places.

    今年生产1070万吨钢的计划已完成83.4％
    全国钢产量接近九百万吨
    十八个重点企业同时抓钢和钢材、抓产量和质量
    各地“小土群”冶炼运动全力提高质量和外调好铁
    新华社23日讯　11月中旬，我国钢铁生产又向一千零七十万吨钢迈进了一大步。到20日，全国钢产量已经达到八百九十二万五千零三十五吨，占全年生产计划83.4％。目前，几千万钢铁大军正在继续猛攻质量关，把生产的钢铁轧制成更多的优质钢材供应国家建设的需要。十八个重点企业已经开始转入一手抓钢、一手抓钢材，一手抓产量、一手抓质量的阶段。各省区的“小土群”冶炼钢铁运动，也正在全力提高生铁质量，把好铁调运出来支援重点企业生产。
    在这一旬中，全国钢的日产水平还在继续稳步提高。从11日到20日，平均每天生产钢九万一千八百吨，比11月上旬增长了16％以上。
    在这一旬中各个重点企业不论钢和钢材的产量都比过去有所增长。钢比上旬增长12.5％，钢材增长5.7％。很多企业正在向含硫较高的生铁进行斗争。上海钢铁工人在最近创造的构造简单的化铁炉，可以使生铁的含硫量从1.2％以上降到0.3％以下，因而大大有助于提高钢的质量。重庆钢铁公司经技术人员和工人一起努力，党委书记亲自参加试验以后，已经基本上掌握了土铁炼钢的规律。各钢厂由于大量使用来自四川、贵州两省的土铁，11月中旬产量比上旬增长了19％。
    在钢材生产方面，各企业正在积极采取措施，准备开展一个群众性的技术革新运动，争取在短时期内把轧钢的生产水平跃进上去。前一时期由于集中力量抓钢铁生产而放松的一些新轧钢机的安装工程，现在都已有专人负责快速安装，准备最近就要陆续投入生产。
    为了支援重点企业的生产，各地掀起的生产好铁，调运好铁的高潮正在继续发展。从11月上旬开始，一个抢运生铁的运输网已在全国形成。在许多通往铁路和公路沿线的大小道路上，到处都是车水马龙，络绎不绝。光是湖南一省，就调动了五十三万七千辆牛车、马车和汽车抢运生铁。各运输线上的职工，也都提出“让铁先行”的口号，把分散在各地的生铁日夜运往上海、北京、重庆等地。据河南、安徽、湖南等十二个省区统计，截至20日，本月已运出的生铁27万多吨。很多省都由各级党委书记亲自负责，布置和检查外调任务，并成立了验收站，不合格的生铁不准外调。广西、山东等省区为了使外调生铁全部是好铁，宁愿自己少炼钢，或是把次铁重新回炉重炼，因而得到了上海等地各钢厂工人的赞扬。
