Major Reform of the Soviet Education System

    A Red Line Through Education Reform

    Since the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has carried out a series of reforms in its education system. A red line that runs through the entire reform is strengthening the connection between education and life.

    In the more than forty years since the establishment of the Soviet regime, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the government have achieved significant accomplishments in developing secondary education, higher education, and vocational education. Currently, in the Soviet Union, on average, one in every four people is studying at school. This new academic year, the number of university students in the Soviet Union reaches 2.15 million, which is three times more than the total number of university students in the four countries of Britain, France, West Germany, and Italy combined, whose total population equals that of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's brilliant achievements in education are acknowledged even by capitalist countries. For example, the head of the American delegation that visited the Soviet Union, the Director of the U.S. Office of Education, Derthick, said: "We simply cannot imagine how much effort the Soviet Union, as a country, has made on education as a means of national progress... Ten American educators, upon returning home, were awakened by what they saw and heard."

    However, the Soviet Union is not satisfied with the achievements it has already made. In recent years, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Soviet educators have constantly pointed out that there are still some shortcomings in the rapid development of Soviet education. The main shortcoming is that there is a disconnect between education and life. In the past, secondary school graduates often lacked labor experience and were afraid to participate in industrial and agricultural production. On the other hand, secondary school graduates who went to work in factories also found the work very difficult due to a lack of training. With the popularization of secondary education, the vast majority of secondary school graduates have to enter production, so this contradiction has become increasingly prominent.

    Lenin once said, "Without the combination of the younger generation's education and productive labor, the ideal of future society is unimaginable." The tasks of the new stage of Soviet communist construction increasingly urgently require the complete elimination of the disconnect between education and life and production.

    In order to overcome the phenomenon of education being disconnected from life, the 20th Congress of the CPSU proposed the task of universally implementing polytechnic education in primary and secondary schools. At the 13th Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League held in April this year, Comrade Khrushchev further put forward the direction of vigorously reforming the education system, clearly pointing out that the main task of Soviet secondary schools is not to prepare forces for universities as in the past, but to cultivate young people to go into life and participate in communist construction. Recently, the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee approved Comrade Khrushchev's opinion on strengthening the connection between schools and life and further developing the Soviet national education system. At present, the issue of reforming the education system has been placed on the agenda of the Soviet Union's current important work.

    Polytechnic Education in Primary and Secondary Schools

    In recent years, Soviet schools have done a lot of work in combining education with productive labor. Polytechnic education has been universally implemented in primary and secondary schools in various places, that is, labor classes are set up from the lower grades. Students in grades four to seven work for two hours a week in the school's small factory, and students in grades eight to ten, in addition to two hours of production practice per week, also go directly to factories or rural areas to work for sixty to eighty hours each year. The implementation of this measure has given students a certain amount of labor production experience and enhanced their labor perspective. In recent years, many places in the Soviet Union have created good experiences in connecting education and productive labor. Among them, the experiences of the Stavropol Territory, Ryazan Oblast, the Ukrainian Republic, and the Russian Federation Republic have received universal attention throughout the Soviet Union.

    The Stavropol Territory has created advanced experience in combining schools with agricultural production. So far, the region has organized a total of 314 student production teams, with 25,000 senior middle school students participating in the production teams. Collective farms allocate certain land to the student production teams and stipulate that they complete certain production tasks. Students participating in the production teams usually go to the fields to work at certain times. During the summer vacation, these students work in the fields all day. This year, student production teams planted a total of 34,000 hectares of corn, generally achieving a bumper harvest. The academic performance of these students in general courses not only did not decrease due to labor, but actually increased by an average of 2%. Students have greatly promoted the communist spirit, strengthened discipline, and their sense of responsibility for work in collective labor. Comrade Khrushchev highly valued this experience of the Stavropol Territory. This experience has now been promoted throughout the Soviet Union.

    The advanced experience of Ryazan Oblast, which has received national attention, is that schools run farms. Now every middle school in the state has 20 to 70 hectares of teaching experimental farms. Last year alone, senior middle school students in Ryazan Oblast worked three million workdays, supplying the state with tens of thousands of tons of grain and 93,000 tons of silage. Many states in the Soviet Union are now studying and adopting this experience.

    Four years ago, vocational and technical education was piloted in some secondary schools in Ukraine, that is, students mastered a technical skill while receiving general secondary education. In these four years, these schools have trained more than 17,000 graduates who have mastered professional skills such as lathe workers, fitters, and agricultural machinery. Last academic year, 3,500 secondary schools in Ukraine adopted this method, where students mastered 44 different professional skills. Next year, the number of such secondary school graduates will increase to more than 80,000.

    In the Russian Federation Republic, this semi-work and semi-study system was piloted in 50 secondary schools last academic year. The entire study period for students is 11 years. In the first eight years, general education and polytechnic education are conducted, and in the last three years, students spend about half of their time each week participating in labor in economic sectors such as factories and farms. The effect of this system pilot was very good, so about 200 secondary schools in the Russian Federation Republic adopted this new system this academic year.

    Two Stages of Secondary Education

    However, the universal implementation of polytechnic education in schools at present is far from solving the task of connecting education with productive labor. Recently, Comrade Khrushchev suggested that secondary education be divided into two stages. The first stage includes the compulsory education of seven or eight-year schools with polytechnic education. The second stage focuses on vocational education. The forms of this stage can be diverse, and the advanced experience of various places in the Soviet Union is of great reference value here. Comrade Khrushchev suggested that students who graduate from seven or eight-year schools should participate in production without exception. He believes that the most suitable way for the second stage is for young people to participate in night school and correspondence school studies without leaving their jobs. Young people who study in production positions can get two or three days of study time per week.

    Recently, in the discussion of Comrade Khrushchev's proposal throughout the Soviet Union, everyone expressed great approval of Comrade Khrushchev's suggestion to divide secondary education into two stages. It is stipulated in Khrushchev's report outline on the control figures of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan that by 1965, the transition from universal compulsory seven-year education to universal compulsory eight-year education will be realized, and the night school form and correspondence higher and secondary specialized education will be vigorously promoted. The famous Soviet educator Kairov recently said in an article published in the Soviet "Communist" magazine that after the education reform, 15- and 16-year-old young people can participate in productive labor, so "the role of education in solving the fundamental tasks of communist construction such as eliminating the difference between mental and physical labor is increasingly enhanced." He believes that the labor engaged in by students should be the basis for improving the quality of teaching and ideological education.

    Reform of Higher Education

    In recent years, the Soviet Union has also carried out some reforms in higher education, and these reforms have achieved certain results in connecting higher education with reality and production. This is first reflected in the changes in the enrollment system of universities. The teaching experience of Soviet universities proves that a college student from a production position is much stronger than a college student who comes directly from middle school in terms of attitude towards learning and learning effect. Therefore, the Soviet Union has determined that universities should mainly enroll young people with two years of work experience during enrollment. In 1957, young people with two years of work experience and those who had served in the army accounted for 27% of the freshmen in Soviet universities. This year, this proportion has risen to 80%. The distribution of universities has also undergone great changes. Four or five years ago, Soviet universities were mainly concentrated in large cities such as Moscow and Leningrad, which were out of touch with production realities. The situation has changed in recent years. For example, in recent years, with the development of the Soviet East, the higher education network there is constantly expanding. There are now more than 200 universities in the Soviet East, with more than 500,000 students, accounting for about a quarter of the total number of university students in the Soviet Union. In order to closely integrate education with production, the Soviet Union has greatly expanded the night school and correspondence education network in recent years. In the 1957-1958 academic year, 880,000 of the 2.15 million university students in the Soviet Union were studying in night schools and correspondence schools. This academic year, the number of university students studying in night schools and correspondence schools will reach 950,000.

    Vigorously running night schools and correspondence schools is the future development direction of Soviet higher education. The night school and correspondence school method is a good way to closely combine education and productive labor. At the same time, according to the principle of all-round development of people required by communism, running more night schools and correspondence schools can enable people in production positions to have more opportunities to study art, music, humanities, etc. according to their wishes.

    Recently, Comrade Khrushchev pointed out in his opinion on reforming the education system that the actual training of many university graduates is very poor, so he suggested reorganizing higher education. He believes that in most schools, students' first two or three years of study should be part-time. Starting from the third grade, students should participate in production for two or three days a week, and only in the last two years can they study full-time, except for the necessary time for production practice. In Comrade Khrushchev's opinion and the opinions of Soviet educators on reforming the education system, it is recommended that factories and farms run universities, and it is also advocated that universities run enterprises.

    Now Comrade Khrushchev's proposal is being hotly discussed throughout the Soviet Union. In three to five years, Soviet schools will be reorganized. The reform of the Soviet education system will undoubtedly accelerate the pace of the Soviet Union's advance towards communism.

    苏联教育制度的重大改革

    教育改革中的一根红线
    自从苏联共产党第二十次代表大会以后，苏联在教育制度上进行了一系列的改革。贯穿在整个改革中的一条红线，就是加强教育同生活的联系。
    苏维埃政权成立四十多年以来，苏联共产党和政府无论在发展中等教育、高等教育或专业教育方面，都取得了重大的成就。目前在苏联，平均每四个人当中就有一个人在学校学习。现在这个新学年，苏联的大学生达到二百一十五万人，这比人口总和与苏联相等的英、法、西德和意大利四国的大学生总数还多三倍。苏联在教育方面取得的辉煌成就，连资本主义国家也不得不承认。例如，率领美国代表团访问过苏联的美国教育司司长德锡克说：“我们简直不能设想：苏联作为一个国家对作为国民进步手段的教育作了怎样大的努力……十个美国教育家回国的时候，由于他们的所见所闻而清醒过来了”。
    但是，苏联并没有满足于已得的成就。近几年来，苏联共产党和苏联教育工作者不断指出，苏联教育在迅速发展中还存在一些缺点，主要的缺点是，教育同生活存在着脱节的现象。过去，中学毕业生往往由于缺乏劳动锻炼，对参加工农业生产有畏惧情绪。另一方面，到工厂工作的中学毕业生，也由于锻炼少而感到工作很吃力。随着中等教育的普及，绝大多数的中学毕业生都要投入生产，因此，这个矛盾日益更加突出了。
    列宁曾经说过，“没有年轻一代的教育和生产劳动的结合，未来社会的理想是不能想像的”。苏联共产主义建设新阶段的任务日益迫切地要求，彻底消除教育同生活和生产脱节的现象。
    为了克服教育同生活脱节的现象，苏共第二十次代表大会提出了在中小学校普遍推行综合技术教育的任务。在今年4月召开的苏联列宁共产主义青年团第十三次代表大会上，赫鲁晓夫同志进一步提出了大力改革教育制度的方向，明确指出，苏联中学的主要任务，不是过去那样为高等学校准备力量，而是培养青年走向生活，参加共产主义建设。最近，苏共中央主席团批准了赫鲁晓夫同志关于加强学校同生活的联系和进一步发展苏联国民教育制度的意见书。目前，改革教育制度问题已提到苏联当前重要工作的日程上来了。
    中小学的综合技术教育
    最近几年，苏联的学校在使教育和生产劳动相结合方面作了很多工作。各地中小学普遍推行了综合技术教育，即从低级班起就设立劳动课，四至七年级的学生每周在学校的小工厂里劳动两小时，八至十年级的学生除了每周两小时的生产实习以外，每年还要直接到工厂或农村去劳动六十至八十小时。这个措施的实行，使学生受到了一定的劳动生产的锻炼，增强了学生的劳动观点。这几年，苏联有很多地方创造了教育和生产劳动相联系的好经验。其中，斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区、梁赞州、乌克兰共和国和俄罗斯联邦共和国的经验，受到了苏联全国普遍的重视。
    斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区创造了学校同农业生产相结合的先进经验，到目前为止，这个地区一共组织了三百一十四个学生生产队，参加生产队的有二万五千名中学高年级的学生。集体农庄分配给学生生产队负责一定的土地，规定他们完成一定的生产任务。平时参加生产队的学生们按一定的时间到田里去劳动，暑假期间，这些学生整日都在地里劳动。今年，学生生产队一共播种了三万四千公顷玉蜀黍，普遍获得了丰收。而这些学生的一般课程的学习成绩，不但没因劳动而降低，反而平均提高了2％。学生们在集体劳动中大大发扬了共产主义精神，加强了纪律性和对工作的责任感。赫鲁晓夫同志对斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区的这个经验估价很高。这个经验现已在全苏各地推广。
    受到全国重视的梁赞州的先进经验是，学校办农场。现在这个州的每一所中学都有二十至七十公顷的教学实验农场。去年一年，梁赞州中学高年级的学生作了三百万个劳动日，供给国家几万吨粮食和九万三千吨青贮饲料。苏联有很多州，现在正在研究和采用这个经验。
    四年以前，在乌克兰的一部分中学里试行了专业技术教育，即学生在接受一般中等教育的同时，还掌握一门技术。在这四年中间，这些学校培养出了一万七千多名掌握了旋工、钳工、农业机械等专业技术的毕业生。上个学年，在乌克兰已有三千五百个中学采用了这个办法，那里的学生分别掌握四十四种不同的专业技术。明年，这样的中学毕业生将增加到八万多名。
    在俄罗斯联邦共和国，上个学年在五十个中学试行这样半工半读的制度：学生的整个学习期限为十一年，前八年进行一般的教育和综合技术教育，后三年学生每周约有一半的时间在工厂、农庄等经济部门参加劳动。这个制度试行的效果很好，所以这个学年在俄罗斯联邦共和国约有二百个中学采用了这个新制度。
    中等教育的两个阶段
    但是目前学校普遍推行的综合技术教育，还远不能解决教育同生产劳动相联系的任务。最近，赫鲁晓夫同志建议，把中等教育分成两个阶段。第一个阶段，包括综合技术教育的七年或八年制学校的义务教育。第二个阶段着重于专业教育。这个阶段的方式可以是多种多样的，苏联各地的先进经验在这里有很大的参考价值。赫鲁晓夫同志建议，七年或八年制学校毕业的学生，无例外地都要参加生产。他认为第二个阶段最适宜的方式是，青年不脱产参加夜校和函授学校学习。在生产岗位上学习的青年，每周可以得到两三天的学习时间。
    最近，全苏各地在讨论赫鲁晓夫同志的建议中，大家表示非常赞成赫鲁晓夫同志关于把中等教育分成两个阶段的建议。在赫鲁晓夫关于苏联七年计划控制数字的报告提纲里规定，到1965年将实现从七年制普及义务教育向八年制普及义务教育的过渡，并且要大力推广夜校形式的和函授的高等和中等专科教育。著名的苏联教育学家凯洛夫最近在苏联“共产党人”杂志上发表的文章中说，教育改革以后，十五、六岁的青年就可以参加生产劳动，这样一来，“在解决像消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别这样的共产主义建设的根本任务中，教育的作用日益提高”。他认为，学生从事的劳动应是提高教学和思想教育质量的基础。
    高等教育的改革
    这几年，苏联在高等教育方面也进行了一些改革，这些改革在使高等教育同实际、同生产的联系上取得了一定的成绩。这首先表现在高等学校招生制度的改变上。苏联高等学校的教学经验证明，一个从生产岗位上来的大学生同一个直接从中学来的大学生比较，前者在对待学习的态度和学习效果上都比后者强得多。因此，苏联就确定了高等学校招生时，主要招收有两年工作经验的青年。1957年，苏联高等学校一年级新生里，具有两年工龄和在军队中服过役的青年占总数的27％，今年这个比重已上升到80％。高等学校的分布情况也有了很大的变化。四、五年以前，苏联高等学校主要集中在莫斯科、列宁格勒等大城市里，同生产实际脱节。这几年情况变了。例如，近年来随着苏联东部的开发，那里的高等教育网正在不断扩大。现在苏联东部已有二百多所高等学校，拥有五十多万名大学生，约占苏联大学生总数的四分之一。为了使教育密切结合生产，近年来苏联大大扩展了夜校和函授教育网。1957至1958学年中，苏联的二百一十五万大学生里有八十八万名是在夜校和函授学校学习的。这个学年，在夜大学和函授学校学习的大学生要达到九十五万人。
    大力兴办夜校和函授学校是苏联高等教育今后发展的方向。夜校和函授学校的方式是教育和生产劳动密切结合的好办法。同时，根据共产主义要求人全面发展的原则，多办夜校和函授学校，就可以使生产岗位上的人有更多的机会按照自己的愿望去学习艺术、音乐、人文科学等。
    最近，赫鲁晓夫同志在关于改革教育制度的意见书中指出，现在许多大学毕业生的实际锻炼很差，因此他建议改组高等教育。他认为，在大多数的学校里，学生头二、三年的学习应是不脱产的。从三年级开始，学生每周应有二、三天参加生产，只有到了最后两年，除了生产实习必需的时间外，才可以完全脱产学习。在赫鲁晓夫同志的意见书里和苏联教育工作者关于改革教育制度的意见中，都建议工厂、农场办大学，并且也提倡大学办企业。
    现在苏联各地正在热烈讨论赫鲁晓夫同志的建议。三至五年以后，苏联的学校将改组完毕。苏联教育制度的改革，无疑地将加速苏联向共产主义前进的步伐。
