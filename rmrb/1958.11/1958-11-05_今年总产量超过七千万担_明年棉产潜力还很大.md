Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 4th: The National On-the-Spot Conference on Leaping Forward in Cotton Production, which closed here, proposed to further emancipate the mind, exert full effort, and make next year's cotton output achieve another leap forward like this year. During the conference, representatives from various places visited Siyang in Jiangsu Province, Xinxiang and Huojia in Henan Province, Macheng, Tianmen, and Jingshan in Hubei Province, etc., to visit and hold meetings simultaneously, which played a significant role in continuing to emancipate the mind and learn advanced technologies.

According to statistics from various places at the meeting, this year's total cotton output in the country will exceed seventy million dan, with an average yield of about ninety jin per mu (lint cotton, same below). Large-scale high yield is the biggest feature of this year's cotton production. Last year, no province in the country achieved a yield of one hundred jin of lint cotton per mu, while this year, ten provinces (regions) and cities, including Zhejiang, Shanxi, Hubei, Shandong, Hebei, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Xinjiang, Gansu, and Shanghai, have reached a yield of one hundred jin of lint cotton per mu. There are a total of three hundred and thirty-six counties and cities with a yield of one hundred jin of lint cotton per mu, accounting for one-third of the cotton-producing counties in the country. Among them, there are sixty-four counties and cities with a yield of two hundred jin of lint cotton per mu or more. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently more than seventy high-yield "satellites" with a yield of over one thousand jin of lint cotton per mu, totaling more than one thousand one hundred mu. This further reveals the secret of the enormous potential of cotton production.

Another feature of this year's bumper cotton harvest is that both old and new cotton-growing areas, as well as previously low-yielding areas, have achieved unprecedented bumper harvests. In particular, the formerly low-yielding northern Hubei, southern Henan, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu Xuhuai regions have seen their cotton production soar, increasing several times over, with some areas even surpassing high-yield cotton regions. For example, the Xiangyang Special Zone in northern Hubei, with nearly two million mu of cotton, achieved a yield of one hundred and sixty-six jin per mu this year, an increase of more than four times over last year. The increase in Siyang County in the Xuhuai area of Jiangsu Province this year is even more astonishing. This new cotton-growing area previously had a yield of only about ten jin per mu, but this year it has surged to two hundred and fifty jin.

The meeting believed that this year's national cotton bumper harvest is the result of emancipating the mind and breaking superstitions. Through the nationwide rectification movement, the anti-rightist struggle, and the rural socialist education movement, especially under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, various conservative ideas have been overcome in various places. Party committee secretaries at all levels personally took command, vigorously engaged in experimental fields, and strengthened leadership over cotton production. At the same time, various localities also held on-site meetings, carried out large-scale comparisons and inspections, and extensively carried out communist large-scale cooperation, which played a significant role in achieving large-scale yield increases.

The meeting pointed out that although the national cotton production has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, the increase in production is uneven. According to preliminary statistics, there are still four hundred and seventy-five counties in the country with an average yield of less than sixty jin per mu (these counties are cotton-growing areas with relatively scattered cotton fields). In areas with higher yields per mu, there are also many loopholes in production. This shows that the potential for cotton yield increase is still very large. Therefore, the meeting believes that all localities must further emancipate their minds, exert full effort, continue to criticize conservative ideas, conscientiously implement yield-increasing measures such as water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, density, prevention and control of pests and diseases, improvement of tools, and strengthening field management, give full play to the wisdom of the masses, and strive to create various methods to reduce bud and boll abscission, and strive for another leap forward in cotton production like this year.

The meeting was convened by the Ministry of Agriculture and was held from October 11th to 29th. (Attached picture)

### 今年总产量超过七千万担  明年棉产潜力还很大

    今年总产量超过七千万担
    明年棉产潜力还很大
    据新华社武汉4日电　在这里闭幕的全国棉花生产跃进现场会议，提出了进一步解放思想，鼓足干劲，使明年棉花产量还要来一个同今年一样的飞跃。会议期间，各地代表先后到江苏省泗阳，河南省新乡、获嘉，湖北省麻城、天门和京山等县，边参观，边开会，这对继续解放思想，学习先进技术，作用很大。
    会上据各地材料统计，今年全国棉花总产量将超过七千万担，平均亩产量在九十斤左右（皮棉，下同）。大面积丰产是今年棉花生产的最大特点。去年全国没有一个百斤皮棉省，而今年已有浙江、山西、湖北、山东、河北、陕西、江苏、新疆、甘肃、上海等十个省（区）市达到亩产皮棉百斤。百斤皮棉县、市共有三百三十六个，它们占到全国产棉县的三分之一。其中亩产皮棉二百斤以上的有六十四个县、市。亩产千斤皮棉以上的高产
  “卫星”，据不完全统计，目前已有七十多处共一千一百多亩。这就进一步揭开了棉花生产巨大潜力的秘密。
    今年棉花丰产的另一个特点是，不论老棉区、新棉区或原来的低产区都空前大丰收。特别是过去低产的鄂北、豫南、皖北和苏北徐淮地区，今年棉花产量都扶摇直上，翻了几番，有些地区甚至超过了高产棉区。例如，鄂北襄阳专区近二百万亩棉花，今年亩产量达到一百六十六斤，比去年增产四倍还多。江苏省徐淮地区的泗阳县，今年增产的幅度更为惊人。这个新棉区过去亩产一般只有十斤左右，今年却激增到二百五十斤。
    会议认为，今年全国棉花大丰收是由于解放了思想，破除了迷信的结果。各地通过全民整风运动、反右派斗争和农村社会主义教育运动，特别是在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，战胜了各种各样的保守思想。各级党委书记都亲自挂帅，大搞试验田，加强对棉花生产的领导。同时，各地还召开现场会，大评比、大检查，广泛地开展共产主义大协作，这对实现大面积增产，作用显著。
    会议指出，全国棉花生产虽获得了空前大丰收，但是增产是不平衡的。据初步统计，全国还有四百七十五个县平均亩产量不到六十斤（这些县都是棉田比较分散的棉区）。在亩产量较高的地区，生产上也存在着不少漏洞。这说明棉花增产潜力还大得很。因此会议认为，各地必须进一步解放思想，鼓足干劲，继续批判保守思想，认真贯彻水、肥、土、种、密、防治病虫害、改良工具、加强田间管理等增产措施，充分发挥群众智慧，千方百计地创造各种方法，减少蕾铃脱落，力争棉花产量还要来一个同今年一样的飞跃。
    会议是由农业部召开的，在10月11日到29日举行。（附图片）
