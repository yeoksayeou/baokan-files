Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 30th. Under the stimulation of American Bill Haley's jitterbug "band" playing vulgar American songs, about 20,000 West German young men and women in the cities of West Berlin, Hamburg, and Essen engaged in brawls on the 26th, 27th, and 28th, destroying the performance halls, causing huge losses, and leaving many seriously injured. These events fully demonstrate the bestial effect of jitterbug music.

When this American jitterbug "band" gave its first performance at the large sports stadium in West Berlin on the evening of the 26th, about 7,000 young men and women went to listen. As soon as the screaming performance began, the venue was immediately in turmoil. Hysterical youths swarmed onto the stage in groups, performing madman-like jitterbug dances. Then they started making trouble. In an instant, all the seats in the stadium were smashed, and it eventually turned into a fierce brawl. More than 50 people were injured in the brawl, some of them seriously.

The Bill Haley band went to perform at the Grugahalle in Essen on the 28th. In addition to destroying all the equipment in the hall, 6,000 crazed West German young men and women ganged up and fought with the police in the streets. The police finally brought fire trucks and used water cannons to disperse them. (Attached picture)

    阿飞舞音乐激起阿飞兽性
    西德连续发生青年大殴斗
    新华社柏林30日电　西柏林、汉堡和埃森三个城市的两万名西德男女青年，在美国的毕尔·哈莱阿飞舞“乐队”演奏美国下流歌曲的刺激下，在26日、27日和28日连续发生殴斗，捣毁了演奏大厅，造成了巨大损失，许多人受重伤。这些事件充分显示了阿飞舞音乐的兽性作用。
    当这个美国阿飞舞“乐队”26日晚上在西柏林的大体育馆首次演出时，前往听演奏的青年男女约有七千人。那种狂叫的演奏刚一开始，场内立刻就骚动起来，歇斯底里的青年们成群地拥上舞台，作狂人般的阿飞舞。接着就开始肇事，刹那间体育馆内的全部座椅被捣毁，最后演变为剧烈的殴斗。在殴斗中受伤者达五十多人，其中一部分受重伤。
    毕尔·哈莱乐队28日又到埃森的格罗加大厅去演奏，疯狂的六千名西德青年男女除了破坏了大厅里的全部设备外，还在大街上成帮结伙地和警察打架，警察最后开来了消防车，用水龙才驱散了他们。（附图片）
