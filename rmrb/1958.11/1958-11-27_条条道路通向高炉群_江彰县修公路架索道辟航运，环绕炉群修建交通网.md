Chengdu, November 26th (Reported by our reporters Ji Xichen and Sun Yuedong): Jiangzhang County, Sichuan Province, is building a transportation network extending in all directions with earth-made blast furnaces as the center, ensuring the normal production of the furnace group and liberating a large number of laborers from carrying burdens on their shoulders.

Jiangzhang County has abundant mountains and rich mineral resources, and is one of Sichuan Province's future iron and steel bases. Currently, laborers from six counties, including Santai and Luojiang, have established eight furnace groups here, comprising three thousand earth-made blast furnaces. Although the county has railways, highways, and waterways, there are few roads leading to the mining areas and furnace groups, and some even have none. In the mass steelmaking movement, 40% to 60% of the iron and steel army's manpower was invested in the transportation of ore, fuel, and living materials. The transportation lines in the steep and narrow mining areas were extremely congested, and transportation efficiency was very low.

In order to ensure the supply of the furnace group and transport the produced steel out in a timely manner, the county party committee mobilized the masses to adopt the "small earth group" method to reform transportation, requiring the close connection of mining areas and furnace groups, furnace groups and furnace groups, and furnace groups and transportation trunk lines such as railways, highways, and waterways. In addition to the already built Zhongyan Highway serving as a trunk line, assisting the Baoji-Chengdu Railway for short-distance transportation, it is planned to build more than twenty simple highway branch lines to connect the furnace groups and mining areas scattered throughout the area, and then build a trunk line to directly connect the eight furnace groups on one line. The eighty-plus kilometer waterway of the Fujiang River and the Rangshui River, which run through the main mining areas, will also be opened and dredged, and a large number of wooden boats will be newly built. Nine overhead cart tracks, 29 kilometers in length, will be built from the mining area to the docks, stations and other transfer points, and overhead carts, handcarts, etc. will be used to concentrate the ore to the transfer points for cart tracks and boat transport.

The transportation tools and methods in the high mountain mining areas are also being vigorously reformed. In the past, ore could only be transported down the mountain by manual carrying between cliffs and precipices. Now, we are beginning to build wooden rail earth train tracks, aerial cableways, slides, winches, chutes, etc., adapting to local conditions, and using improved tools to transport the ore down the mountain. This will not only save labor, but also improve efficiency. The chutes built in Hejiashan mining area according to the steep slope terrain can transport ore to the Rangshui River in a timely manner, transporting more than 3,000 tons of ore a day, eliminating manual carrying, saving 4,000 laborers, and increasing efficiency by 200 times.

Currently, in addition to a trunk highway connecting the furnace group and the mining area, which is under surveying, the remaining simple highways have been started, and some have already been opened to traffic. Many earth train tracks, cableways, and chutes in the mining area have been erected.

The Sichuan Provincial Department of Transportation recently held an on-site meeting to promote Jiangzhang County's experience throughout the province. (Picture attached)

    条条道路通向高炉群
    江彰县修公路架索道辟航运，环绕炉群修建交通网
    本报成都26日电　记者纪希晨、孙跃冬报道：四川省江彰县以土高炉为中心修建四通八达的运输网，保证炉群正常生产，把大批劳动力从肩挑人背下解放出来。
    江彰县境内多山，矿藏丰富，是将来四川省的钢铁基地之一。现在，来自三台、罗江等六个县的民工，在这里建立了包括三千座土高炉的八处炉群。这个县境内虽然有铁路、公路和航道，但是通往矿区和炉群的道路却很少，有的甚至没有。全民炼钢炼铁运动中，占钢铁大军40％到60％的人力投入了矿石、燃料和生活资料的运输工作。山陡路窄的矿区运输线上，拥挤不堪，运输效率很低。
    为了保证炉群的供应，并且及时把生产出来的钢铁运送出去，县委发动群众采用“小土群”的办法，改革交通运输，要求把矿区和炉群、炉群和炉群，以及炉群和铁路、公路、航道等交通干线密切联系起来。除已修的中雁公路作为干线，辅助宝成铁路作短途运输外，计划再经过二十多条简易公路支线，把分散在各地的炉群和矿区连接起来，然后再修一条干线，把八处炉群直接连在一条线上。纵贯主要矿区的涪江和让水河，八十多公里的航道也将加以开辟整治，并要新修大批木船。从矿区到码头、车站等转运点之间，要修筑九条二十九公里长的架架车道，用架架车、手推车等把矿石集中到车道、船运的转运点。
    高山矿区内的运输工具和运输方法，也在大力改革。在悬崖峭壁间，过去只能靠人力背挑来运输矿石下山；现在，开始因地制宜地建设木轨土火车道、空中索道、滑道、绞车、溜槽等，采用改良工具把矿石运下山来。这样，既能节省劳力，又能提高工效。何家山矿区依陡坡地势修建的溜槽，能把矿石及时运到让水河边，一天可以运三千多吨矿石，消灭了肩挑人背，节省劳力四千个，提高工效二百倍。
    目前，除一条连接炉群和矿区的干线公路正在勘测外，其余简易公路都已开工修建，有的已经通车。矿区的许多土火车道、索道、溜槽，已经架设起来。
