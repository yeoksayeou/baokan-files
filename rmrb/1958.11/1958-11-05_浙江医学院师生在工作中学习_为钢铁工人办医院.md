Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 4th. Students from the fourth and fifth grades of Zhejiang Medical College have established a new type of worker's hospital – the Banshan Worker's Hospital – at the Banshan Steel Plant in the suburbs of Hangzhou. Since its opening on September 1, the hospital has treated more than 10,000 patients and admitted more than 100. Under the students' careful diagnosis and treatment, the cure and improvement rate of patients has reached 100%, with no liability or technical accidents, and no deaths.

All the students participating in running the hospital take turns working as physicians, nurses, pharmacists, registration clerks, and workers. They have learned how to prescribe for common illnesses and how to care for patients, and they are familiar with drug dosages and properties. In the past, many students studied at medical school for four years without learning how to give injections, only going around in circles with theory. Now, most students have learned to write prescriptions independently for common illnesses. In the past, students thought acupuncture was mysterious and difficult, but now, under the guidance of acupuncture teachers, they can independently give patients acupuncture after only three hours of practice, and the effect is very good. The students' classes and case discussions in the hospital are also conducted in conjunction with practical issues in diagnosis and treatment.

Because they live among the workers regularly, the students have come to appreciate the noble qualities of the working class. In the outpatient department, they see some older workers who are unwilling to rest even when they are sick, and some inpatients repeatedly request to be discharged before they are fully recovered, unable to put down production. This selfless dedication to work greatly encourages the students' enthusiasm. Students now generally work and study for more than ten hours a day, some working for sixteen hours a day, and still take time to wash clothes for patients. When one worker had a poor appetite, the students patiently prepared five different types of liquid diets for him. After working the night shift, student Wu Deren heard that the ingredients for the liquid diet had run out, and immediately rushed to the city, spending the whole day buying everything that was needed. The workers posted big-character posters to thank the students, saying, "The current doctors are so good, following us to the furnace platform, seeing us for medical problems, and caring about our health. We must produce well and launch the satellite of the blast furnace."

In order to further reduce the incidence of illness among workers, the students have recently implemented a system of workshop physician responsibility, with students assigned to take charge of the medical and preventive work of a workshop. They adopt the method of delivering medicine with the shift, sending medicine to the workshop and dormitory, urging workers to take medicine on time, and observing the effects of the medicine. They compile statistics on the incidence of illness among workers in the workshop and help improve working conditions.

When the students of Zhejiang Medical College began to plan to run the hospital under the leadership of the Party Committee, some people disagreed. They believed that running such a hospital with poor equipment and a limited variety of diseases could only solve the problem of being "red" but not the problem of being "expert," and expressed doubts about whether it could improve the quality of teaching. The facts now prove that students going to factories and rural areas to run hospitals, putting politics in command, and learning and applying at the same time, closely integrating theory with practice, has significant results in improving both the quality of teaching and the political awareness of students. It is a good way to both popularize medical work and cultivate medical cadres who are both "red" and "expert."

Recently, the students of this medical college also opened a branch hospital in Kangqiao, near the steel plant, to facilitate medical treatment for nearby farmers.

### 浙江医学院师生在工作中学习  为钢铁工人办医院

    浙江医学院师生在工作中学习
    为钢铁工人办医院
    新华社杭州4日电　浙江医学院四、五年级部分学生，在杭州市郊半山钢铁厂办起了一所新型的工人医院——半山工人医院。这个医院从9月1日开诊到现在，共治疗了一万多人次，住院病人有一百多人。在学生们的细心诊治下，病人的治愈好转率达到百分之百，没有发生过责任事故和技术事故，更没有死亡的病例。
    参加办医院的全体学生轮流担任医师、护士、药剂师、挂号、工友等工作。他们学会了一般病例的处方和怎样护理病人，也熟悉了药物的剂量和性状。过去很多学生在医学院学了四年还不会打针，光会在理论上打打圈子。现在大部分学生都学会了一般病例的单独处方。过去学生们认为针灸既神秘又困难，现在他们在针灸教师指导下，只作了三小时实习，就都能独立给病人针灸，而且效果很好。学生们在医院里上课和举行病例讨论会，也都是结合诊断治疗上的实际问题进行的。
    由于经常生活在工人中，学生们已经体会到工人阶级的高贵品质。在门诊中，他们看到一些老工人生了病还不肯休息，有的住院病人病还没有全好就一再要求出院，丢不下生产。这种忘我劳动的品质大大鼓舞了学生们的工作热情。学生们现在工作学习一般都在十小时以上，有的一天工作十六小时，还抽空来为病人洗衣服。有个工人胃口不好，学生们不厌其烦地为他作了五次不同花样的流汁饮食。学生吴德仁在当了夜班以后，听说流汁饮食的原料已用完，顾不得休息就立即赶到城里，跑了一整天，才把需要的东西都买回来了。工人们贴大字报感谢这些学生说：“现在的医师真好，跟着我们一道到炉台，为我们看病，关心我们工人的健康。我们一定要好好生产，把高炉的卫星放出去。”
    为了进一步减少工人的发病率，最近学生们进一步实行车间医师负责制，由学生们分组包干一个车间的医疗和预防工作。他们采取跟班发药的办法，把药送到车间、宿舍，督促工人按时吃药，观察吃药效果。他们统计车间工人的发病情况和帮助改善劳动条件。
    浙江医学院学生在党委领导下开始酝酿办医院时，曾经有一些人不同意，他们认为办这样的医院，设备差，病种不多，只能解决红的问题，不能解决专的问题，对能否提高教学质量表示怀疑。现在的事实证明，学生到工厂、农村办医院，政治挂帅，边学边用，使理论密切联系实际，不论在提高教学质量或提高学生政治觉悟方面都有显著成效，既有利于普及医务工作，又能培养又红又专的医务干部，是一个好办法。
    最近这个医学院的学生又在钢铁厂附近的康桥开办了一个分院，以便利附近的农民看病。
