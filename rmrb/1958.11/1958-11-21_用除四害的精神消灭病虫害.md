    Eliminate Pests and Diseases with the Spirit of Eliminating the Four Pests

    This year's victory on the food front not only brought an unprecedented bumper harvest to China's grain production but also allowed us to find the eight-character charter for developing agricultural production: water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, close planting, protection, tools, and management. As long as we adhere to and fully implement these eight characters, we can achieve an even greater leap forward in China's agricultural production.

    Now is the winter plowing season, the best season to eliminate crop pests. We would like to express some opinions on the issue of plant protection and the elimination of crop pests and diseases.

    In agricultural production, pests and diseases seriously threaten the normal growth and harvest of crops. According to estimates from past normal years, grain crops suffer an average annual yield reduction of more than one-tenth due to pests and diseases, cotton an average annual reduction of more than two-tenths, and various orchards an average annual reduction of more than four-tenths. In recent years, due to the rapid development of China's industrial construction and agricultural science, and due to the victory of agricultural cooperation, a broad prospect has been opened up for the prevention and control of pests and diseases. In the past few years, the Party and the government have led farmers in one pest and disease prevention and control campaign after another, and have achieved remarkable results. Especially this year, with the great leap forward in agricultural production, the achievements in preventing and controlling pests and diseases have been even greater. The area of pest and disease control nationwide reached 1.84 billion mu, and 730 pest-free counties emerged (eliminating one or more types). Taking Shaanxi Province as an example, the province's pest and disease control area is about 44 million mu, equivalent to the total area of autumn crops. The province has basically eliminated wheat midges, cotton aphids, red spiders, blind bugs, and other pests, and it is estimated that the province will protect more than 1 billion jin of grain and more than 1.25 million dan of cotton. Thirty-five counties have emerged with no single pest or disease affecting a single crop. However, judging from the national situation, the progress of pest and disease control work is very uneven. Many areas are still affected by pests and diseases, and some areas even have quite serious pest and disease problems. According to a survey in Shaanxi Province, the province lost more than 200 million jin of grain due to rice stem borers, rice planthoppers, and potato late blight alone. If all these pests and diseases could be eliminated, this year's grain output could be greatly increased.

    Next year, agricultural production will take an even greater leap forward, and yields per unit area will increase rapidly. In order to ensure the realization of a greater harvest next year, in addition to implementing various yield-increasing measures such as water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, and close planting, the thorough elimination of pests and diseases is also a very important measure. All localities should, with the spirit of eliminating the four pests, launch several large-scale pest and disease elimination campaigns nationwide at appropriate times, so that various crops do not suffer yield reductions due to pests and diseases.

    There is no doubt that the broad masses will make their utmost efforts to achieve this task, and they will also be opposed and doubted by people with various conservative and backward ideas. They believe that China's agricultural science is not developed, and the production of pesticides and machinery for pest and disease control is still very backward. Therefore, pest and disease control can only be done slowly, and the targets cannot be set too high. They say: "Gradually reducing pests and diseases is possible, but completely eliminating them is impossible." Therefore, before launching a large-scale pest and disease elimination campaign, it is very necessary to conduct a debate on the thorough elimination of pests and diseases among cadres and the masses as an ideological preparation for the movement. The great victories in pest and disease control in recent years, especially this year, can completely defeat all conservative ideas, and the realization of communization throughout the country provides us with very favorable conditions for completely eliminating pests.

    The key to completely eliminating pests and diseases lies in strengthening the Party's leadership, putting politics in command, and launching a mass movement for pest and disease control on a large scale. Party committees at all levels should establish pest and disease control headquarters at each level, formulate pest and disease control plans, and organize unified pest and disease control campaigns. In particular, people's communes and production teams, in addition to establishing leadership organizations for pest and disease control, should also train a large number of technical personnel to widely impart pest and disease control techniques to farmers. Establish professional pest and disease control teams and pest monitoring and forecasting stations (groups), and formulate specific pest and disease control plans in order to accurately and thoroughly eliminate various pests and diseases.

    To carry out a mass pest and disease elimination campaign, it is necessary to promote the spirit of communist collaboration, organize joint prevention and control between provinces and provinces, counties and counties, and communes and communes, formulate joint prevention covenants, and cooperate in combat. Most pests and diseases are not a problem for one region, often involving dozens of counties and several provinces. It is necessary to cooperate with each other and carry out comprehensive prevention and control, otherwise, pests and diseases cannot be completely eliminated. Agricultural science, pesticide machinery production, and commercial departments should actively cooperate with the pest and disease control movement. In particular, each province should start production and preparation of effective local pesticides as soon as possible after experiments.

    At present, some areas have already launched winter pest and disease control work. This is the prelude to striving for the victory of completely eliminating major pests and diseases next year. Winter pest and disease control has many benefits. Eliminating one insect in winter can reduce hundreds or even thousands of insects next year; controlling one mu this year may ensure that thousands of mu of crops are not harmed next year; pests and diseases are easy to eliminate during hibernation; and winter control work can be combined with winter plowing, sowing (such as soil treatment, seed dressing, collecting firewood, and threshing stubble), and other work. All localities should universally launch a winter pest and disease control campaign and not let pests overwinter. This is a decisive battle. If this battle is won, most pests and diseases can be prevented from occurring or occurring less next year.

    The task of completely eliminating pests and diseases is very arduous, but as long as we earnestly strengthen the Party's leadership, boldly mobilize the masses, break superstitions, and liberate our minds, we can completely eliminate all major agricultural pests and diseases.

### 用除四害的精神消灭病虫害

    用除四害的精神消灭病虫害
    今年粮食战线上的胜利，不仅使我国的粮食产量获得了空前的大丰收，还使我们找到了发展农业生产的水、肥、土、种、密、保、工、管八条宪法，只要我们坚持并全面贯彻这八条宪法，就能够使我国的农业生产获得更大的跃进。
    现在正是冬耕季节，是消灭农作物虫害最好的季节，我们仅就植物保护消灭作物病虫害问题发表一点意见。
    农业生产中病虫害严重地威胁着农作物正常生长和收成。根据过去正常年景推算，粮食作物由于病虫害每年平均减产十分之一以上，棉花平均每年减产十分之二以上，各种果园每年平均减产十分之四以上。最近几年来，由于我国工业建设和农业科学飞快的发展，由于农业合作化的胜利，给防治病虫害工作开拓了一个广阔的前途。几年来，党和政府领导农民开展了一次又一次的防治病虫害的运动，并且取得显著的成绩。尤其是今年，随着农业生产大跃进，防治病虫害的成绩更加巨大。全国防治病虫害的面积达十八亿四千万亩，并出现了七百三十个无病虫害县（消灭一种或多种）。以陕西省为例，全省防治病虫害面积约有四千四百多万亩，相当秋季作物的总面积，全省基本上消灭了小麦吸浆虫、棉蚜、红蜘蛛、盲椿象等虫害，预计全省共保产粮食十亿多斤，保产棉花一百二十五万多担；出现了三十五个单项作物无单项病虫害县。但是，从全国情况看来，防治病虫害工作进展得很不平衡，受病虫害的地区还很多，甚至有些地区的病虫害还相当严重。据陕西省调查，仅稻螟虫、稻飞虱和马铃薯晚疫病为害，全省就损失粮食二亿多斤，如果能够把这些病虫害全部消灭掉，今年粮食产量还可以大大地提高。
    明年，农业生产将要更大的跃进，单位面积产量将飞速的提高。为了保证实现明年更大的丰收，除了贯彻水、肥、土、种、密等各种增产措施以外，彻底消灭病虫害也是一项十分重要的措施。各地应该以除四害的精神，在全国范围内于适当时期开展几次消灭病虫害的大规模的运动，做到各种农作物不因病虫害而减产。
    毫无疑问，广大群众一定会鼓足最大的干劲为实现这个任务而努力，也一定会受到具有各种保守落后思想的人的反对和怀疑。他们认为我国农业科学不发达，防治病虫害的药、械生产还很落后，因此，防治病虫害的事情只能慢慢来，指标不能提得太高。他们说：“逐年减少病虫害是可以的，彻底消灭病虫害是不可能的”。因此，在大搞消灭病虫害运动之前，在干部和群众中开展一次关于彻底消灭病虫害的辩论，作为运动的思想准备工作就成为十分必要的了。几年来尤其是今年来防治病虫害的伟大胜利，完全可以击败一切保守思想，特别是全国实现公社化，更给我们彻底消灭虫害提供了十分有利的条件。
    彻底消灭病虫害的关键，在于加强党的领导，实行政治挂帅，掀起大规模的防治病虫害的群众运动。各级党委应层层建立防治病虫害的指挥部，制订出防治病虫害的规划，统一组织防治病虫害的战役。尤其是各人民公社和生产队，除了建立防治病虫害的领导组织外，还要训练大批的技术人员，在农民中广泛地传授防治病虫害的技术。建立防治病虫害的专业队伍和虫情预测预报站（组），制订具体的防治病虫害的计划，以便准确而彻底地消灭各种病虫害。
    开展群众性的消灭病虫害运动，必须发扬共产主义协作的精神，组织省与省、县与县、公社与公社之间的联防联治，制订联防公约，配合作战。大多数的病虫害不是一个地区的问题，往往涉及几十个县几个省的范围，必须互相协作全面进行防治，不然就不能彻底消灭病虫害。农业科学、药械生产和商业部门，应该积极地配合防治病虫害运动。特别是经过实验有效的土农药各省更应及早进行生产和准备。
    目前，有些地区已经展开了冬季防治病虫害的工作。这是争取明年彻底消灭主要病虫害胜利的先声。冬季防治病虫害有很多好处，冬季消灭一个虫，明年就能减少几百个甚至几万个虫；今年防治一亩，明年就可能保证千百亩农作物不受害；病虫害在冬眠期容易消灭；而且冬季防治工作可以和冬耕、播种（如土壤处理、药剂拌种、拾烧柴、打谷茬）等，工作结合进行。各地应该普遍地开展一个冬季防治病虫害运动，不让害虫过冬。这是一个决定性的战役，这一战役打胜了，明年就可以使绝大部分病虫害不发生或少发生。
    彻底消灭病虫害的任务是非常艰巨的，但是只要认真加强党的领导，放手发动群众，大破迷信，解放思想，我们完全可以把农业上的一切主要病虫害消灭干净。
