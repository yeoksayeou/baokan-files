　　A year ago, there were two red moons rotating,
　　And at the same time, two great declarations appeared on earth.
　　A conference of sixty-four Communist and Workers' Parties,
　　Including delegations from socialist countries,
　　Was held in the Kremlin Palace in Moscow,
　　Summarizing decades of Marxist-Leninist experience.
　　The whole world was filled with songs of peace,
　　Everyone recognized the unparalleled superiority of socialism.
　　The forty-year-old Soviet Union will soon surpass the United States in all aspects,
　　The mere eight-year-old China will soon surpass England in all aspects,
　　Socialist countries are leaping forward at breakneck speed.
　　The socialist system is maintaining its wonderful youth,
　　The capitalist system has long reached the age of decrepitude.
　　Universal truth has grasped the inevitability of human development,
　　The dictatorship of the proletariat is the engine flying towards freedom,
　　The East wind has prevailed over the West wind, who would dare not believe it?
　　The facts of the past year have provided further proof,
　　The Iraqi revolution punctured the Baghdad Pact,
　　American imperialism has withdrawn its troops from Lebanon.
　　Paper tigers are nothing but paper tigers,
　　Hasn't its true form been further revealed in the Taiwan Strait?
　　The dense clouds of economic crisis are spreading across the West,
　　The United States has five million unemployed lacking food and clothing.
　　The American rulers suffered a disastrous defeat in the election,
　　Yet the hangman's noose is still tightly around their necks,
　　Like a ball rolling down a slope, it won't stop until it reaches the bottom.
　　We are a rising force, the enemy is dying;
　　Our contempt for the enemy is not arbitrary underestimation.
　　We are advancing with the momentum of "one day equals twenty years,"
　　We must achieve "if one man can do a hundred, I will do ten thousand; if one man can do a thousand, I will do a billion," (note)
　　Stir up our energy, change the balance of power between the enemy and us.
　　Look, isn't our steel about to exceed ten million tons?
　　Hasn't our grain reached a thousand jin per person?
　　Aren't the people's communes boiling like ocean waves,
　　Blooming everywhere, everywhere are songs of the Great Leap Forward?
　　Haven't the six hundred and fifty million people become of one heart?
　　Listen, isn't the third red moon calling?
　　"I was sent into outer space by a long-range rocket,
　　The distance I am from the Guanghan Palace is not so far.
　　That long-range rocket that sent me into outer space,
　　Can accurately deliver warheads to any location!"
　　The peaceful East wind is prevailing over the West wind, fanning day and night,
　　Making those who execute the Cold War policy into rapidly collapsing icebergs.
　　Yet there are shameless Judases betraying the working people,
　　Pitifully, they only betrayed themselves, their worth only thirty yuan;
　　This will make modern revisionists infamous for ten thousand years!
　　Paper tigers are nothing but paper tigers,
　　If anyone is terrified in front of them,
　　Then they may follow the path Judas took.
　　The working people hold the authority to reverse heaven and earth,
　　To make the entire universe dance in our palms.

　　(Note): In ancient times, there was a saying, "If one man can do one thing, I will do a hundred; if one man can do ten things, I will do a thousand." Here, the numbers are expanded according to that ratio.

    掌握着旋乾转坤的权柄
    ——纪念莫斯科宣言一周年
    郭沫若
    一年前有两个红色月亮在旋转，
    而同时地上出现了两篇伟大的宣言。
    六十四个共产党和工人党会议，
    其中包含着社会主义国家的代表团，
    举行在莫斯科的克里姆林宫殿，
    总结了几十年来马列主义的经验。
    全世界都充满着和平的歌颂声，
    谁都认出了社会主义的无比优越性。
    四十岁的苏联很快就要全面超美，
    仅仅八岁的中国很快就要全面超英，
    社会主义国家都在以飞快的速度跃进。
    社会主义制度正葆其美妙的青春，
    资本主义制度早到了风烛的残龄。
    普遍真理掌握了人类发展的必然性，
    无产阶级专政是飞向自由的引擎，
    东风已经压倒西风，谁肯不信？
    一年来的事实又有了不少的证明，
    伊拉克革命戳破了巴格达条约，
    美帝国主义已经从黎巴嫩撤兵。
    纸老虎不是别的，就只是纸老虎，
    在台湾海峡不是进一步现了原形？
    经济危机的稠云正弥漫着西方，
    美国有五百万失业者缺乏衣粮。
    美国统治者在选举中遭到惨败，
    然而绞刑索依然紧紧套在颈上，
    犹如斜坡滚丸，不到底没有下场。
    我们是方生力量，敌人是方死；
    我们藐视敌人并非任意轻敌。
    我们正以“一天等于二十年”的气势，
    我们要做到“人百己万，人千己亿”，（注）
    鼓足干劲，改变敌我力量的对比。
    请看，我们的钢不是快要超过一千万吨？
    我们的粮食不是已达到人各一千斤？
    人民公社不是就像海浪一样沸腾，
    遍地开花，遍地都是大跃进的歌声？
    六亿五千万人民不是已成一条心？
    请听，第三个红色月亮不是在呼唤？
    “我是被远程火箭送进了外层空间，
    我离开广寒宫已相差得不那么远。
    把我送到外层空间的那远程火箭，
    可以把弹头准确地送到任何地点！”
    和平的东风压倒着西风，在日夜荡扇，
    使冷战政策执行者已成快倒的冰山。
    然而竟有出卖劳动人民的无耻犹大，
    可怜只出卖了他自己，身价只三十元；
    这就使现代的修正主义者遗臭万年！
    纸老虎不是别的，就只是纸老虎，
    谁如果在它的面前要发生恐怖，
    那就有可能走上犹大所走的道路。
    劳动人民掌握着旋乾转坤的权柄，
    要使整个宇宙在我们的掌中飞舞。
    （注）：古有“人一能之，己百之；人十能之，己千之”的话，这儿按着那个比例把数字扩大了。
