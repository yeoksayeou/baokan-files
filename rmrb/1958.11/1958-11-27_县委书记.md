    County Party Secretary
    Duan Bin of Yunnan Dengchuan Jiaoshi Steel Plant
    County Party Secretary Li Zirong,
    Everyone calls him Shennong.
    This year, he charges forward to conquer new ground,
    Each shot aimed at steel and copper.
    A strong wind blows, uprooting trees,
    Heavy rain obscures the sky,
    Amidst the wind and rain, voices shout,
    One furnace tilts halfway over.
    The dragon twists and raises its head fiercely,
    The secretary strides forward to rescue it,
    Just as he reaches the furnace's edge,
    A stone falls and hits his head.
    Blood stains and rainwater soak his battle robe,
    The hero's will remains unshaken,
    He rebuilds the furnace with a smile,
    Surpassing Lu Ban building a celestial bridge.
    He doesn't bow before difficulties,
    He won't rest until he sees molten iron,
    His enthusiasm is even hotter than the furnace fire,
    Burning so that molten iron flows from every furnace.

    县委书记
    云南邓川焦石钢铁厂　段斌
    县委书记李自荣，
    大伙称他是神农。
    今年拍马攻新阵，
    枪枪挑的钢铁铜。
    大风吹得树根翻，
    猛雨迷烟不见天，
    风雨之中人声叫，
    一座炉子歪半边。
    蛟龙翻身猛抬头，
    书记大步去挽救，
    刚刚跑到炉子边，
    石块掉下砸着头。
    血斑雨水湿战袍，
    英雄意志不动摇，
    手砌炉子脸带笑，
    赛过鲁班造仙桥。
    困难面前不低头，
    不见铁水不甘休，
    热心更比炉火旺，
    烧得炉炉铁水流。
