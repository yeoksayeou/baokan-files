Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: The Third Enlarged Meeting of the Sixth Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party was held in Beijing from the 8th to the 20th.

This meeting summarized the achievements and experiences of the China Zhi Gong Party's anti-rightist struggle and general rectification movement over the past year and more, and summarized the work achievements and shortcomings of the Zhi Gong Party in the people's democratic united front under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party over the past few years. Through this summary, the delegates present at the meeting further realized that although the Zhi Gong Party has achieved some victories on the political and ideological fronts through the anti-rightist struggle and general rectification, it is still a bourgeois political party. Most of its members are still in an intermediate state politically, wavering between the two roads of capitalism and socialism. Therefore, the most urgent and serious task for the Zhi Gong Party at present is to accelerate the fundamental transformation of its members and organization, thoroughly break with the capitalist stance, establish a socialist stance, and rapidly transform the Zhi Gong Party from a bourgeois political party into a political party that truly accepts the leadership of the Communist Party and serves socialism. The meeting also unanimously adopted a plan for the fundamental transformation of the organization and its members, calling on all members to draw up more specific and feasible personal transformation plans to spur themselves according to this plan.

During the meeting, all the delegates carefully studied Chairman Mao's documents on imperialism and all reactionaries being paper tigers, and Premier Zhou Enlai's report on "The Current Situation of the Struggle in the Taiwan Strait Area and the Anti-Imperialist Tasks of the Chinese People." They also discussed some issues related to the people's communes. During the discussion, the delegates felt very indignant about the crimes of aggression committed by American imperialism against our country, and further recognized the essence of imperialism, which looks powerful but is actually weak. They unanimously expressed their determination to accelerate their transformation and serve socialism well under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    致公党六届中央委员会三次扩大会议提出
    加紧改造为社会主义服务
    新华社22日讯　中国致公党第六届中央委员会第三次扩大会议8日到20日在北京举行。
    这次会议总结了一年多来中国致公党反右派斗争和一般整风运动的成绩和经验，总结了致公党几年来在中国共产党领导的人民民主统一战线中的工作成绩和缺点。到会的代表通过这一次总结，进一步认识到致公党虽然经过了反右派斗争和一般整风，在政治战线和思想战线上都取得了一些胜利，但仍然是一个资产阶级性的政党，大多数成员在政治上仍然处于中间状态，摇摆于资本主义与社会主义两条道路之间，因此，致公党当前最迫切最严重的任务，就是加紧进行成员和组织的根本改造，彻底破资本主义立场，立社会主义立场，使致公党迅速从一个资产阶级性的政党改变成为一个真正接受共产党领导的为社会主义服务的政党。会议还一致通过了对组织和成员进行根本改造的规划，号召全体成员根据这个规划，订出更具体的切实可行的个人改造规划来鞭策自己。
    会议期间，全体代表认真学习了毛主席的论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的文献和周恩来总理“目前台湾海峡地区的斗争形势和中国人民的反帝任务”的报告，还讨论了有关人民公社的一些问题。代表们在讨论中对美国帝国主义对我国的侵略罪行感到十分愤慨，并且更进一步认清了貌似强大实则虚弱的帝国主义的本质。他们一致表示决心在共产党和毛主席的领导下，加速改造自己，好好为社会主义服务。
