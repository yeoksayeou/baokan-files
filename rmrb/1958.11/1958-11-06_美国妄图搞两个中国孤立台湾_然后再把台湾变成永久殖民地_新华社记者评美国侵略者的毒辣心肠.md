The American imperialists, who persist in armed aggression and war provocations against China, have played a new card: attempting to create "two Chinas." In the Taipei Communiqué, US Secretary of State Dulles openly designated the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek Group as a tiny "Free China" to stand in opposition to the "Communist China" that Dulles admitted "does indeed exist." There are further moves planned after this one. "Two Chinas" is just the first step in the American conspiracy. The United States wants to first use "two Chinas" to completely isolate Taiwan. If this step succeeds, the next move will be to eliminate this "Free China" as well, with the United States, under the guise of a United Nations trusteeship, turning Taiwan into a colony and war base under the complete control of the United States.

Some leaders of the US government are already openly advocating the creation of "two Chinas," as seen in the recent series of talks and speeches by Eisenhower, Nixon, and Dulles. However, regarding the next step in the American conspiracy, these people generally remain tight-lipped and avoid discussing it. Those who serve US monopoly capital naturally understand a set of fraudulent business practices; they know that revealing too many cards will make it even more difficult to peddle this vicious scheme of the United States.

However, since the plan is in their hearts, it is impossible to hide it. Recently, discussions about the trusteeship of Taiwan within the American ruling group have increased. The Democratic Advisory Committee, composed of senior Democrats such as Stevenson and Truman, issued a statement last month saying that "the United States should, in consultation with other governments, request the United Nations to make recommendations" to "consolidate and stabilize the entire Formosa (Taiwan) region." Ten Democratic congressmen, including Eugene McCarthy, also jointly issued a statement at the beginning of last month saying that the United States "should strive to have the United Nations administer Formosa," which would enable the United States "together with certain allies" to "guarantee Formosa." Republican Senator Cooper, who has close ties with the Eisenhower administration, advocated in a radio speech in early September that Taiwan be "placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations," and he explained that "the issue is not what Chiang Kai-shek's interests are," but that the United States "must be guided by our (American) national interests."

In the American bourgeois press, such discussions are even more prevalent. The famous American columnist Lippmann said that the United States should "go to the United Nations and suggest that Formosa become an autonomous territory, neutralized and demilitarized under international supervision." The "New York Post" said that the answer lies in "placing the entire Formosa under the protection of a United Nations trusteeship." The "Washington Post" said that the United States should "seek independent international guarantees for Formosa to defend Formosa." Such statements vary in form but are the same in essence: to keep Taiwan in American hands. The "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" expressed the intentions of the American aggressors quite clearly, saying that the US Far East policy currently "needs a nail even more powerful than the one attached to Chiang Kai-shek."

In fact, the US imperialists' plan to place Taiwan under trusteeship is not recent. As early as 1947, when US special envoy Wedemeyer came to China and saw that the Chiang Kai-shek Group, supported by US money and weapons, was suffering crushing defeats in the anti-people civil war, he suggested in a secret report to the US government that Taiwan be placed under "American protection and United Nations trusteeship." In 1949, when the Chinese people drove the Chiang Kai-shek Group and the American forces behind it out of mainland China, the US government publicly published Wedemeyer's report in the White Paper on Sino-American Relations. According to a report in the "New York Post" on September 12 this year, Dulles was also "one of the first people to propose UN trusteeship of Formosa," and in 1949 he "believed that a UN-trusteed government of Formosa was the most effective way to keep the island from falling into the hands of Communist China."

Now, the United States is making the long-planned conspiracy of "two Chinas" a public matter, with the intention of permanently occupying Taiwan. Since the US military occupation of Taiwan in 1950, US officials have unashamedly referred to Taiwan as its "unsinkable aircraft carrier" and "forward military base" in the Western Pacific. The US policy of creating "two Chinas" and then placing Taiwan under trusteeship, in terms of its goals, is certainly not limited to occupying Taiwan, but rather to use Taiwan as a base for preparing for war for a long time, waiting for an opportunity to attack mainland China and further expand its aggression against China.

The US calculation is to put a cloak of "international legitimacy" on the US act of brutally occupying Chinese territory through a United Nations or other form of trusteeship, and to drag other countries to commit to the "obligation" to "defend" Taiwan. It is very clear that the United States wants to use force to divide Chinese territory, and whether it is "two Chinas" or trusteeship of Taiwan, it is continuing to carry out war provocations against China. The US authorities, which are currently very isolated internationally, are precisely trying to use new tricks such as "two Chinas," "trusteeship," and "international guarantees" to lure other countries into the water and share the serious consequences of US armed aggression against China. This is a dangerous trap that the United States is setting up.

For the Taiwan authorities, the US trusteeship plan is to turn Taiwan into a permanent US colony, leaving them with no place to live. Recently, haven't American bourgeois newspapers been lashing out at Chiang Kai-shek as "a debt that the United States cannot afford to bear" ("The Nation" magazine), and as the "biggest burden on America's prestige in Asia" ("The New Republic" magazine)? Some American newspapers have also outlined the vicious intentions of the United States. American columnist Lippmann wrote in the "Washington Post" on October 2 that the United States should "stand firm" in Taiwan and "prepare for the disappearance of the Chiang Kai-shek regime." An issue of "The Nation" magazine on September 13 put it more bluntly: "Neutralization under UN trusteeship" is to make Taiwan "the pre-mortem tomb of Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang."

The Chinese people have long firmly declared that they will never allow the United States' conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and permanently occupy Taiwan to succeed. Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory, and the United States' attempt to turn it into a US trusteeship or colony is absolutely impossible. The Taiwan authorities are also expressing opposition to this point.

All patriotic Chinese people should unite and work together to defeat the US conspiracy. Nine years ago, the Chinese people had already shattered the American imperialists' wild dream of turning the entire China into its colony. Now, the Chinese people are even more powerful and confident to complete the great cause of national reunification and shatter the new wild dream of the United States to place Taiwan under trusteeship.

    美国妄图搞两个中国孤立台湾
    然后再把台湾变成永久殖民地
    新华社记者评美国侵略者的毒辣心肠
    坚持对中国进行武装侵略和战争挑衅的美帝国主义者，摆出了一着新棋子，就是企图制造“两个中国”。美国国务卿杜勒斯在台北会谈公报里，公开把台湾蒋介石集团封为小小的“自由中国”，来同杜勒斯承认“确实存在”的“共产党中国”相对峙。棋后还有棋，“两个中国”不过是美国阴谋里的第一步。美国想先用“两个中国”来把台湾完全孤立起来，若是此步得逞，下一着便要把这个“自由中国”也取消掉，由美国假借联合国托管台湾，把台湾变成美国一手控制的殖民地和战争基地。
    美国政府一些领导人已经在公开鼓吹制造“两个中国”，这见诸艾森豪威尔、尼克松和杜勒斯最近发表的一连串谈话、演说中。但是，对于美国阴谋的下一步，这些人目前一般还是讳莫如深，避而不谈。为美国垄断资本服务的人物，自然是深懂得一套欺诈生意经的，他们知道，如果多露底牌，就会更难于兜售美国的这种毒辣计谋。
    然而，既然有计在心，想是藏不住的。最近以来，美国统治集团里关于托管台湾的谈论，已越来越多。由史蒂文森、杜鲁门等民主党高级人士组成的民主党谘询委员会在上月发表声明说，“美国应在同其他政府磋商的情况下，要求联合国提出建议”，来“巩固和稳定整个福摩萨（台湾）地区”。尤金·麦卡锡等十个民主党众议员在上月初也联署声明说，美国“应当努力使联合国管理福摩萨”，这种行动可以使美国“跟某些盟国一起”来“保障福摩萨”。同艾森豪威尔政府有密切联系的共和党参议员库柏，在9月初的广播演说里主张把台湾“交给联合国托管”，他并且解释说，“问题不在于蒋介石的利益是什么”，美国“必须以我们（美国）的国家利益为指针”。
    在美国资产阶级报刊上，这种议论更比比皆是。美国有名的专栏作家李普曼说，美国应“前往联合国，建议使福摩萨成为一个自治的领土，在国际监督下中立化和非军事化”。“纽约邮报”说，答案在于“把整个福摩萨置于联合国托管的保护之下”。“华盛顿邮报”说，美国要“谋求对于福摩萨的独立的国际保证来保卫福摩萨”。诸如这般的说法是形形色色，实质则一，就是要把台湾抓在美国手里。“圣路易邮报”把美国侵略者的意向表达得颇为清楚，它说，美国的远东政策目前“需要一个比附在蒋介石身上更加强有力的钉子”。
    实际上，美帝国主义者托管台湾的打算，也并不是到最近才有。早在1947年，美国特使魏德迈来中国，看到美国出钱出枪支撑的蒋介石集团在反人民的内战里兵败如山倒，他就在给美国政府的秘密报告里，建议把台湾放在“美国的保护和联合国的托管”下。到1949年，中国人民把蒋介石集团及其背后的美国势力逐出中国大陆之际，美国政府在中美关系白皮书里公开发表了魏德迈的报告。据“纽约邮报”今年9月12日报道，杜勒斯也“是最先提出由联合国托管福摩萨的主张的人们之一”，他在1949年便“认为联合国托管福摩萨的政府是不让这个岛屿落入共产党中国的手中的最有效的办法”。
    现在，美国把幕后策划已久的“两个中国”的阴谋表面化起来，就是企图永久霸占台湾。从1950年美国武力侵占台湾以来，美国官方人士毫不掩饰地把台湾称作是它在西太平洋“不沉的航空母舰”、“前进军事基地”。美国制造“两个中国”进而托管台湾的政策，就其目标说来，当然也绝不仅仅止于侵占台湾，而是要长期以台湾为准备战争的基地，伺机进攻中国大陆，进一步扩大对中国的侵略。
    美国的盘算是，通过联合国或其他名义托管台湾，给美国粗暴侵占中国领土的行径披上一件“国际合法的外衣”，并且拉上其他一些国家来承诺“保卫”台湾的“义务”。事情很明白，美国要用武力来割裂中国领土，无论是“两个中国”还是托管台湾，都是继续在向中国进行战争挑衅。目前在国际上处境十分孤立的美国当局，正是想用“两个中国”、“托管”、“国际保证”之类的新花样，来诱迫别的国家下水，分担美国向中国进行武装侵略的严重后果。这是美国正在布置着的一个危险的圈套。
    对于台湾当局来说，美国托管之计就是要变台湾为美国永久的殖民地，使他们存身无地。近来，美国资产阶级报刊不是已经在大肆辱骂蒋介石是美国“一笔没有力量担负的债务”（“民族”周刊），是美国“在亚洲的威信的最大累赘”（“新共和”杂志）吗？美国的一付毒辣心肠，美国一些报刊也勾划出来了。美国专栏作家李普曼在10月2日的“华盛顿邮报”上写道，美国应该在台湾“站住”，“应该对蒋介石政权的消失作好准备”。“民族”周刊9月13日的一期说得更干脆：“在联合国托管下中立化”是要使台湾成为“蒋介石和国民党的生前的陵墓”。
    中国人民早已坚定地宣布，绝对不容许美国制造“两个中国”、永久霸占台湾的阴谋实现。台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，美国想要把它变成美国的托管地、殖民地，是绝对办不到的。台湾当局现在也是表示反对这一点的。
    一切爱国的中国人民都应该团结起来，一致对外、粉碎美国的阴谋。在九年以前，中国人民就已经击破了美帝国主义要把整个中国变为它的殖民地的狂想。现在，中国人民更加有力量有信心来完成祖国统一大业，击破美国托管台湾的新狂想。　　　　　　（新华社5日讯）
