Xinhua News Agency, October 31st: The "Exhibition on the Integration of Education and Productive Labor," jointly organized by the Ministry of Education and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, opened in Beijing on November 1st. This exhibition marks the brilliant victory of the Chinese Communist Party's policy of "education serving the political interests of the proletariat and integrating education with productive labor," and signifies that the Party's educational policy has blossomed and borne fruit throughout the country. This is a great revolution in China's education.

    Since the beginning of this year, schools at all levels across the country, under the leadership of the Party, have universally implemented the principle of combining work-study programs. By May and June, this had further developed into the large-scale establishment of factories and farms. This movement led by the Party has fundamentally changed the face of China's education, integrating education with productive labor, thereby improving the quality of teaching, promoting scientific research, accelerating the ideological transformation of teachers and students, and the laborization of intellectuals, paving the way for the cultivation of comprehensively developed new people for communism. Visitors can see from the exhibition the amazing achievements that teachers and students have achieved in just a few short months since participating in productive labor. As soon as you step into the entrance of the exhibition hall, you can see airplanes, cars, tractors, seeders, and towering drilling rigs gleaming with silver light displayed in the square. When you step into the first exhibition hall – the comprehensive hall – a scene of abundant variety immediately appears before you. Here are a large number of products belonging to the cutting edge of world science, including atomic reactors (models), electronic computers, semiconductors, and various scientific instruments. These products were designed and manufactured by young teachers and students in a very short period of time, ranging from a few days to a few weeks. Here are models of furnaces for the Great Leap Forward in Steel and various steel products. In order to realize the Party's task of producing 10.7 million tons of steel this year, more than 30,000 students from secondary schools and above were sent to the steel front. Schools across the country have established 72,000 iron-smelting furnaces and 14,400 steel-making furnaces, which can produce 1.586 million tons of steel and iron for the country by the end of this year. Also on display are program-controlled machine tools controlled by magnetic tape and photoelectric tubes. This advanced, highly automated machine tool can automatically process complex workpieces, such as airplane propellers and cams for automatic lathes. With just one worker sitting at the console, the entire process can be supervised. The comprehensive hall also features a large number of products from the machinery industry, power industry, chemical industry, as well as high-yield crops, melons, fruits, and vegetables. According to statistics from the exhibition covering 21,122 secondary schools and above, a total of 151,608 factories have been established. Furthermore, incomplete statistics from schools in twenty provinces and cities show that a total of 10,319 farms have been established, cultivating an area of more than 2.5 million mu. The products of these factories and farms involve almost all sectors of the national economy. What aroused great interest was that elementary school students, like middle school and university students, participated in various types of labor suitable for their age and created excellent achievements. On display were the "Young Pioneer Steel" they smelted, and the small lathes and scientific instruments they manufactured. All of this convincingly demonstrates what kind of miracles the Party's educational policy has created in promoting industrial and agricultural production, teaching, and scientific research! Next to many pictures and objects in the exhibition are striking characters: "Smelting Steel and Iron to Forge New People," "Tanned Skin and Red Hearts." These slogans vividly portray the image of today's new generation of students and at the same time delineate that the "laborers with socialist consciousness and culture" that the Party and the people expect are rapidly growing in schools across the country.

    With the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the Party led the people of the whole country to launch a mass upsurge in running schools. This is a major step by the Party in implementing the mass line in education, which has transformed the education undertaking from walking on one leg to walking on two legs. This upsurge, led by agricultural middle schools and the literacy movement, spread like wildfire. From the materials on display, we can see that in just half a year, 100 million illiterate and semi-illiterate people across the country have emerged from illiteracy, nearly 2,030 counties and cities have popularized elementary education, and the number of middle school and university students has increased from 7,524,000 to 15,790,000.

    It is worth noting that the masses in various places have launched a surging mass movement to establish Red and Expert Schools, amateur cultural and technical schools, and half-work, half-study schools, which have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Among them, there are more than 830,000 Red and Expert Schools and amateur middle and primary schools, with 45 million students. The people's communes in various places have established 577,000 middle and primary schools, with 35.8 million students. In this way, a situation of schools dotted across the country has emerged.

    Implementing work-study programs, establishing factories on a large scale, and establishing farms on a large scale, along with the magnificent mass school-running movement, are two torrents that have emerged in the education revolution led by the Party. These two torrents interact with each other and promote each other, sweeping away the unreasonable phenomenon of the separation of mental and physical labor and the lack of culture among workers and peasants, which have been left over for thousands of years. At present, tens of millions of teachers and students have joined the ranks of workers and peasants in participating in the labor of producing social wealth, and are advancing towards the road of being both Red and Expert. At the same time, tens of millions of workers and peasants have entered schools, moving towards the road of rapid intellectualization. The exhibition shows many exhilarating examples of the intellectualization of workers and peasants. A new generation of poets, writers, painters, scientists, and industrial and agricultural experts have emerged from the ranks of workers and peasants, and the poems created by the workers and peasants that are on display are truly as they themselves say: "They scared Li Bai so much that he was stunned."

    Today, the education undertaking, along with industry and agriculture, has entered an era where "one day equals twenty years." This has been achieved under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Since the beginning of this year, Party committees at all levels have regarded the Great Leap Forward in education as an integral part of the overall Great Leap Forward centered on industrial and agricultural production, and have made unified plans, unified arrangements, and unified leadership. Many provincial Party committees have transferred a large number of cadres, including members of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee, to strengthen leadership over the education front. The secretaries and members of the grassroots Party committees in various places serve concurrently as principals and lecturers of political classes in most of the Red and Expert Schools and agricultural middle schools. Party committees in various places have held many on-site meetings, organized inspections and evaluations, and summarized and promoted the school-running experiences of the masses. From the Party Central Committee to the grassroots Party committees in various places, they have closely grasped education work, thus quickly forming a vigorous mass movement to run education on a large scale throughout the country. The exhibition shows photos of Comrades Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Deng Xiaoping, Lu Dingyi, Kang Sheng, and others from the Party Central Committee inspecting school education in various places. They went deep into classrooms, fields, and workshops, talked with teachers and students, and gave them guidance. Comrade Lu Dingyi discovered that the masses in Jiangsu Province had established two agricultural middle schools, and immediately wrote to Ouyang Huilin, the Minister of Propaganda of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, to actively support the mass initiative, and personally presided over the agricultural middle school conference held in the province. In this way, under the care and guidance of the responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, Jiangsu Province quickly launched a mass upsurge in running agricultural middle schools. Agricultural middle schools developed from two to more than 6,000 within a month, with 340,000 students. The upsurge of running agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu Province quickly spread to the whole country and drove the popularization of elementary education and the development of the literacy movement.

    However, the brilliant achievements that the Party has achieved in the education undertaking cannot be obtained smoothly and without any struggle. The Party's educational policy has been resisted by bourgeois rightist teachers and has constantly encountered the resistance of bourgeois educational thinking. They opposed the masses running schools, opposed schools running factories and farms, and opposed launching mass movements in teaching and scientific research. They said that this would destroy the "normal order" of the school and lower the level of teaching and scientific research. This fallacy of the bourgeoisie was exposed in the mass debates on educational policy conducted in schools across the country and was shattered by living facts. The two electric motors exhibited at the Hefei University of Technology are a clear example of the stark contrast. The students participated in productive labor and produced a 40-kilowatt motor with good performance, while the bourgeois teacher who opposed students participating in productive labor produced a 7-kilowatt motor that could not rotate. There are many similar contrasts in the exhibition.

    In order to adapt to the new situation after schools ran factories and farms on a large scale, the Party led the masses to launch a new teaching reform movement. The exhibits introduce how various schools, after exposing and criticizing various bourgeois ideas and bourgeois academic viewpoints on the education front, included productive labor in the teaching process, and how they formed a vigorous mass movement in teaching and scientific research. To realize the integration of education and productive labor, it is necessary to go through struggle, and there will be a long-term struggle. The preface to the teaching reform section of the exhibition says: The struggle is still continuing in depth, and the process of destroying the old and establishing the new must continue. It is necessary to go through continuous struggle to thoroughly implement the Party's educational policy in order to advance towards the goal of communist schools.

    Now, the education revolution led by the Party has pushed China's education undertaking to a new stage. The situation of rapid progress in education is already before us. From the charts on display, we can see that some large industrial enterprises have established complete educational systems including everything from nurseries to universities, and some schools have merged with factories to form people's communes, with workers and students implementing half-work, half-study programs at the same time. The Tianjin Photographic Equipment Factory was built at the same time as the school was built, and it recruited apprentices who were also students. The factory director grasped production with one hand and education with the other. Using this half-work, half-study method, young people can produce wealth for the country, and they do not cost the country a penny, nor do they rely on their families, and they can continue to study until they graduate from university. The schematic diagram of the popularization of higher education in Xushui People's Commune, Hebei Province, from 1958 to 1963, points out that this commune has popularized primary and secondary education this year, and will universally establish ten-year schools in each residential area next year. In 1963, graduates of the ten-year schools will enter universities. By 1963, all social youth and adults who have undergone spare-time study and half-work, half-study programs will also enter universities. By 1963, this commune will have 50 universities, 100 ten-year schools, as well as normal schools and secondary technical schools, which are evenly distributed throughout the commune. This commune has contracted for all levels of education this year and has fully implemented the half-work, half-study system. The school is the commune's educational institution and also the commune's production unit. The school has its own factory and cultivated area, all students live in dormitories, and a supply system has been implemented.

    All of this points out to us that the magnificent prospect of popularizing higher education in our country, realizing that everyone labors and everyone learns, being both laborers and intellectuals, and eliminating the difference between physical and mental labor in the whole society—this communist future is not far away.

    为无产阶级的政治服务　与生产劳动相结合
    教育大革命　济济出新人
    “教育与生产劳动相结合展览会”显示党的方针的辉煌胜利
    新华社31日讯　教育部和共青团中央联合举办的“教育与生产劳动相结合展览会”，11月1日在北京开幕。这个展览会标志着中国共产党提出的“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动结合”方针已经取得了辉煌的胜利，标志着党的教育方针已经在全国各地开花结果。这是中国教育事业的一个大革命。
    今年年初以来，全国各级学校在党的领导下普遍实行勤工俭学，到5、6月，进而发展到大办工厂、大办农场。党领导的这个运动从根本上改变了我国教育事业的面貌，使教育与生产劳动结合起来，从而提高了教学质量，推动了科学研究，加速了广大师生的思想改造和知识分子劳动化的过程，为培养共产主义的全面发展的新人铺平了道路。观众从展览会上可以看到各地师生参加生产劳动以来的短短的几个月中获得了多么惊人的成绩。你一跨进展览会的大门，便可以看到陈列在广场上的闪烁着银色光芒的飞机和汽车、拖拉机、播种机、高大的钻机。当你跨进第一个展览馆——综合一馆，那种百物俱陈、气象万千的景象马上呈现在你面前。这里有属于世界科学尖端的大量产品，其中包括原子反应堆（模型）、电子计算机、半导体和各种科学仪器。这些产品都是由青年师生在十几天、几十天的极短的时间内设计和制造出的。这里有大炼钢铁的炉子模型和各种钢铁产品。为了实现党提出的今年生产一千零七十万吨钢的任务，全国仅中等以上学校就有三万多人开赴钢铁前线。全国各地学校已经建立七万二千座炼铁炉，一万四千四百座炼钢炉，到今年年底可以为国家生产出钢、铁一百五十八点六万吨。这里还展出有用磁带和光电管控制的程序控制机床。这种先进的高度自动化的机床，能把形状复杂的工件，例如飞机上的螺旋桨、自动车床用的凸轮等自动加工出来。只要有一个工人坐在操纵台上，便可以监督整个工序的进行。在综合一馆展出的还有机械工业、电力工业、化学工业等方面的大量产品，以及高产的农作物和瓜、果、蔬菜等。据展览会就二万一千一百二十二所中等以上学校统计，共办工厂十五万一千六百零八座，另就二十个省市的学校的不完全统计，共办农场一万零三百一十九个，耕种面积二百五十万余亩。这些工厂和农场的产品几乎涉及国民经济所有部门。引起人们浓厚兴趣的是各地小学生们和中学生、大学生一样，参加适合于他们年龄的各种劳动，创造出了优异的成绩。会上陈列了他们炼出的“少先钢”，制造的小车床和科学仪器等。所有这些，都令人信服地表明了党的教育方针在推动工农业生产、教学和科学研究上出现了怎样的奇迹！展览会的许多图片和实物旁边写着醒目的大字：“炼钢炼铁炼新人”、“晒黑了皮肤晒红了心”。这些警句有力地描绘了今天新型的莘莘学子的形象，同时点画出党和人民所期待的“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”，正在各地各校迅速成长。
    随着工农业生产的大跃进，党领导全国人民掀起了群众性的办学高潮。这是党在教育工作中贯彻群众路线的一个重大步骤，它使教育事业由一条腿走路，变为两条腿走路。这个高潮以农业中学和扫盲运动为先导，势如燎原。从展出的材料中，我们可以看到在短短半年中，全国有文盲半文盲一亿人脱离文盲状态，有近二千零三十个县、市普及了小学教育，中学生和大学生的人数由七百五十二点四万人增加到一千五百七十九万人。
    值得注意的是：各地群众风起云涌大量举办红专学校、业余文化技术学校、半工半读学校，它们一时如雨后春笋，遍地开花。其中仅红专学校和业余中、小学就有八十三万多所，就学的有四千五百万人。由各地人民公社办的中、小学有五十七万七千所，学生人数达三千五百八十万人。这样，在全国就出现了一个学校星罗棋布的局面。
    实行勤工俭学，大办工厂，大办农场，和波澜壮阔的群众性办学运动，是党领导的教育大革命中涌现出的两股洪流。这两股洪流相互影响，相互推动，以排山倒海之势横扫数千年遗留下来的劳心与劳力分离和工农缺乏文化的不合理现象。目前，数以千万计的学校师生，已经和工人、农民一起参加到生产社会财富的劳动者的行列中去，朝着又红又专的道路前进。同时，数以千万计的工农劳动群众已经进入学校，朝着迅速知识化的道路前进。会上展出了工农群众知识化的许多令人心花怒放的事例。一批新型的诗人、作家、画家、科学家和工业、农业方面的专家，已经从工农队伍中涌现出来，展出的工农群众创作的那些气盖山河的诗篇，真如他们自己所说：“吓得李白也发呆”。
    今天，教育事业和工业、农业一起进入了“一天等于二十年”的时代。这是在中国共产党领导下实现的。今年年初以来，各级党委都把教育事业的大跃进，作为以工农业生产为中心的全面大跃进的一个组成部分，来统一规划，统一布置，统一领导。许多省委抽调了包括省委常委在内的大量干部，加强对教育阵线的领导。各地红专学校、农业中学，绝大部分是由基层党委的书记、委员兼任校长和讲授政治课。各地党委召开了许多现场会议，组织检查、评比；总结和推广群众的办学经验。从党中央直到各地基层党委都紧紧地抓教育工作，这样迅速地在全国范围内形成了大办教育的轰轰烈烈的群众运动。会上展出了党中央毛主席、刘少奇、周恩来、朱德、邓小平、陆定一、康生等同志在各地视察学校教育的照片。他们深入课堂、田间、车间，和教师、学生攀谈，给他们指导。陆定一同志发现江苏省群众举办了两所农业中学，立即写信给江苏省委宣传部长欧阳惠林，积极支持群众的这个创举，并且亲自主持了这个省召开的农业中学会议。这样，江苏省在党中央负责同志和省委的关怀指导下，很快地掀起了群众性的举办农业中学的高潮，农业中学在一个月内由两所发展到六千多所，入学的有三十四万人。江苏省举办农业中学的高潮，又迅速地扩展到全国，并且带动了小学教育的普及和扫盲运动的开展。
    但是，党在教育事业上所取得的这些辉煌成果，不是一帆风顺、不经过任何的斗争，就能得到的。党的教育方针曾遭到资产阶级右派教师的对抗，也曾不断碰到资产阶级教育思想的抵触。他们反对群众办学，反对学校办工厂、办农场，反对在教学和科学研究中大搞群众运动。他们说：这样把学校的“正常秩序”破坏了，这样降低了教学和科学研究的水平。资产阶级的这种谬论，在各地学校进行的关于教育方针的群众性大辩论中被揭穿了，并且被活生生的事实所粉碎。会上展出的合肥工业大学的两台电动机，就是一场界垒分明的对台戏。学生参加生产劳动制出了四十瓩的电动机，性能很好，而反对学生参加生产劳动的资产阶级教师自己制出的七瓩的电动机，却不能转动。像这类对台戏，展览会上还很多。
    为了适应学校大办工厂、大办农场以后的新形势，党领导群众展开了新的教学改革运动。展品中介绍了各类学校在揭露和批判了教育阵地上形形色色的资产阶级思想和资产阶级学术观点后，如何把生产劳动列入了教学过程，以及如何在教学和科学研究中形成了轰轰烈烈的群众运动。实现教育与生产劳动结合，必须经过斗争，而且将会有长期的斗争。展览会教学改革部分的序言说：斗争还在继续深入，破旧立新的过程还要继续进行，必须经过不断的斗争来彻底实现党的教育方针，才能向共产主义学校的目标前进。
    现在，党领导的教育大革命已经把我国教育事业推进到一个新的阶段。教育事业一日千里的形势已经呈现在我们面前。从展出的图表可以看到：有些大型工业企业已经建立了包括从托儿所到大学的完整的教育体系，有的学校已经和工厂合并，成立人民公社，工人和学生同时实行半工半读。天津摄影器材厂建厂和建校同时进行，招收的是徒工也是学生，厂长一手抓生产，一手抓教育。用这种半工半读的方法，青年人可以给国家生产财富，并且不花国家一文钱，也不依靠家庭，一直读到大学毕业。展出的河北省徐水人民公社1958—1963年普及高等教育示意图指出：这个公社今年已普及中、小学教育，明年将在各居民点普遍建立十年一贯制学校，1963年十年制学校毕业生升入高等学校。1963年，经过业余学习和半工半读的全部社会青壮年也将进入高等学校。到1963年，这个公社有五十所高等学校，一百所十年制学校，还有师范和中等技术学校，它们均衡地分布在公社各地。这个公社今年已把各级教育事业承包下来，全部实行半工半读。学校是公社的教育场所，也是公社的生产单位。学校有自己的工厂和耕作区，学生全部寄宿，并实行了供给制。
    所有这些，给我们指出了在我国普及高等教育，实现人人劳动、人人学习，既是劳动者，又是知识分子，整个社会消灭了体力劳动与脑力劳动的差别——这样一个共产主义的壮丽的前景已不在远了。（附图片）
