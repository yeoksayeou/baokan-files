Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, November 14th: Many areas in Zhejiang Province are adopting the method of "sending culture to mining and industrial areas," vigorously establishing steel schools at steel construction sites. Lin'an County has already established 11 steel spare-time middle school classes and 29 spare-time elementary school classes, with more than 2,000 iron smelting workers participating in learning. FenShui County has established 18 steel spare-time middle schools and 4 Red and Expert schools, with nearly 3,800 workers participating in learning, including those studying in spare-time elementary schools, with an enrollment rate as high as 97%. Currently, steel schools are blossoming everywhere, and a situation of both steelmaking and learning is emerging in many places.

The establishment of steel schools involved ideological struggles among cadres and the masses. Some were afraid of affecting production, some advocated taking it slowly, and some held temporary views on steel production, and therefore did not pay attention to spare-time learning. After overcoming these ideological obstacles, steel schools developed rapidly. Because steel production implemented militarized organization and collectivized life, spare-time learning was easy to arrange uniformly. Moreover, the personnel transferred to the steel front from various places were mostly young and middle-aged, with many Party members, Youth League members, demobilized soldiers, and rural backbones, who had high political awareness and many of whom had just escaped illiteracy and had an urgent need for learning. Therefore, as long as the Party organization adheres to putting politics in command and mobilizes the masses to conduct debates, after the ideological understanding is improved, the workers and masses will throw themselves into the learning movement with a fighting posture.

The steel schools in various places are mostly consistent with the production organization. In FenShui County, the principals of the steel spare-time middle and elementary schools are led by the Party Committee Secretary of the construction site, and the vice principals are concurrently held by the factory director or deputy factory director. A school affairs committee is established through mass election, and some also set up teaching and research groups for each subject. In this way, it is easy to grasp learning and production together, with unified planning, unified deployment, and unified inspection. Teaching also takes various forms according to the production situation, including classroom teaching, furnace-side groups, and contracting teaching and learning, and it advocates "carry textbooks with you, study whenever you have time," and "red flowers bloom on the walls, blackboards hang everywhere, serving as both propaganda stations and literacy boards." Collective learning time is uniformly arranged. Some deliver lunch to the construction site, and study for several tens of minutes on the spot after the meal; some study for one to two hours every night, except for days of crash night work. The principle of teaching equipment is "simple and crude, as long as it can be learned."

The curriculum of steel schools generally includes three subjects: politics, technology, and culture, and the teaching content also reflects the characteristics of serving steel production. Politics is taught by leading cadres of the Party committee, who give lectures on the situation, plans, and the general line of socialist construction. Technical courses are grouped according to operating trades, and technicians lecture on technical principles such as building furnaces, manufacturing refractory materials, and smelting iron and steel, or advanced producers introduce production experience. The cultural course focuses on language, and teachers are resolved by "taking materials locally and taking the able as teachers." The textbooks generally use loose-leaf anthologies and mobilize the masses to compile their own, with rich and colorful content. For example, the article "Steel Dragon": "The sun rises red in the east, blast furnaces form a dragon. The back dragon catches up with the front dragon, and each dragon shows its power. The dragon's mouth spews sparks, each big and red. The dragon's body sways, and the world is turned upside down. With the steel dragon, China will never be poor." This is a portrayal of actual production. After the workers learn it, everyone can recite it and everyone can dictate it, greatly encouraging production enthusiasm.

### 在钢铁工地　学钢铁知识  浙江不少地区把文化送到工矿区去

    在钢铁工地　学钢铁知识
    浙江不少地区把文化送到工矿区去
    新华社杭州14日电　浙江不少地区采取“把文化送到工矿区去”的办法，在钢铁工地大办钢铁学校。临安县已办钢铁业余中学十一班，业余高小二十九班，有二千多炼铁工人参加学习。分水县已办钢铁业余中学十八所，红专学校四所，连同在业余高小学习的，有将近三千八百个工人参加学习，入学率高达97％。目前钢铁学校正在遍地开花，许多地方出现了又炼钢又搞学习的局面。
    创办钢铁学校，在干部和群众中是有思想斗争的，有人怕影响生产，有人主张慢慢来，也有人对钢铁生产抱临时观点，因而对业余学习也就不予重视。克服了这些思想障碍后，钢铁学校发展很快，由于钢铁生产实行组织军事化、生活集体化，业余学习便于统一安排；各地抽调来转入钢铁战线的又都是青壮年，党团员多，复员军人多，农村骨干多，政治觉悟较高，其中有不少是才摆脱文盲状态的，对学习有迫切的要求。因此，只要党组织坚持政治挂帅，发动群众进行辩论，在思想认识提高之后，工人群众就以战斗的姿态投入学习运动。
    各地钢铁学校大都是与生产组织一致的。分水县的钢铁业余中学、小学，校长由工地党委书记挂帅，副校长由厂长或副厂长兼任，并经过群众推选成立校务委员会，有的还设立了各科教研组。这样，便于把学习和生产一起抓，统一规划、统一布置、统一检查。教学也根据生产情况，采取多种多样的形式，有班级上课、炉边小组，包教保学等，并提倡“课本随身带，有空就学习”，“墙头开红花，黑板到处挂，又是鼓动站，又是识字牌”。集体学习的时间都有统一安排，有的把午饭送到工地，饭后就地学习几十分钟；有的除突击开夜工的日子外，每天晚上学习一到二小时。教学设备的原则是“因陋就简，能学就行”。
    钢铁学校课程的设置一般的有政治、技术、文化三门，教学内容也都体现着为钢铁生产服务的特色。政治由党委领导干部上大课，讲形势，讲规划，讲社会主义建设总路线。技术课按操作工种分组，由技术人员讲建炉、制造耐火材料、炼铁炼钢等技术原理，或由先进生产者介绍生产经验。文化课以语文为主，教师则采取“就地取材，能者为师”的办法解决。教材一般都采用活页文选，并发动群众自己编写，内容丰富多彩。如“钢铁龙”一文：“日出东方红，高炉排成龙。后龙赶前龙，龙龙显威风。龙口吐火花，朵朵大又红。龙身一摆动，天翻地也动。有了钢铁龙，中国永不穷。”这是生产实际的写照，工人们学了后，个个会背诵，人人能默写，大大鼓舞了生产热情。
