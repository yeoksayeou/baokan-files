Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Electric Dispatch: Hebei Province convened a steel production technology conference to study fighting high sulfur simultaneously from three aspects: iron smelting, steelmaking, and steel rolling, to rapidly improve the quality of iron and steel, and ensure that iron can become steel and steel can become useful material.

In the past two months or so, Hebei Province's pig iron production has shown a new situation of a double leap forward in quantity and quality. Sintered ore has been reduced compared to the past, but there is still the problem of excessive sulfur content in the quality of the iron, which brings great difficulties to steelmaking and steel rolling. The meeting pointed out that the key to solving the quality problem of iron and steel lies in putting politics in command and mobilizing the masses to overcome ideological barriers. Many facts show that as long as the ideological barrier is overcome first, the technical barrier will be easier to overcome. When visiting the rolling mill, the representatives personally saw that some steel ingots could not be rolled into useful material because of excessive sulfur content, which was deeply enlightening. Everyone unanimously expressed their determination to fight resolutely against high sulfur.

In order to overcome the technical barriers, the meeting put forward specific technical and organizational measures. In terms of iron smelting, the specific measures to reduce sulfur content are: 1. External desulfurization. Coal and ore with high sulfur content are washed and roasted to reduce the sulfur content. 2. In-furnace desulfurization. On the one hand, good slag should be made to increase the alkalinity of the slag; on the other hand, the temperature in the furnace should be increased to accelerate the reaction of lime desulfurization. 3. Establish testing institutions and quickly train testing personnel. In terms of steelmaking, 1. Strengthen raw material management. The used pig iron should be classified and stacked, and special technicians should be assigned to take samples and mix materials. 2. Use alkaline hot-air iron-melting furnaces for desulfurization. 3. Desulfurization in the converter. 4. Use lime powder and charcoal powder for desulfurization in the steel ladle. 5. Add ferromanganese for smelting to reduce the harmfulness of sulfur. In terms of steel rolling, formulate a new heating system and steel rolling process regulations suitable for rolling high-sulfur steel to increase the finished product rate.

### 让铁成钢　让钢成材  河北从各方面向高硫作斗争

    让铁成钢　让钢成材
    河北从各方面向高硫作斗争
    据新华社天津电　河北省召开钢铁生产技术会议，研究从炼铁、炼钢、轧钢三方面同时向高硫作斗争，以迅速提高钢铁质量，保证铁能成钢，钢能成材。
    最近两个多月来，河北省生铁生产出现了数量、质量双跃进的新局面。全省烧结铁已经比过去减少，但是在铁的质量上还存在着含硫过高的问题，给炼钢、轧钢带来很大困难。会议指出，解决钢铁质量问题的关键在于政治挂帅，发动群众过好思想关。许多事实说明，只要首先过好思想关，技术关也就好过了。在参观轧钢厂时，代表们亲自看到有的钢锭因为含硫过高轧不成材，深受启发。大家一致表示决心与高硫作坚决斗争。
    为了过好技术关，会议提出了具体技术组织措施。在炼铁方面，降低含硫量的具体措施是：一、炉外去硫。对含硫高的煤和矿石采用水洗和焙烧，使含硫量降低。二、炉内去硫。一方面是造好渣，提高炉渣的碱度；一方面是提高炉内温度，加速石灰去硫的反应。三、建立化验机构，迅速培养化验人员。在炼钢方面，一、加强原料管理。将使用的生铁分类堆放，指派专门技术人员取样配料。二、采用碱性热风化铁炉脱硫。三、转炉内脱硫。四、在盛钢桶内用石灰粉、木炭粉去硫。五、加锰铁冶炼，以减少硫的危害性。在轧钢方面，制定一套适应于轧制高硫钢的新的加热制度及轧钢工艺规程，以提高轧制成品率。
