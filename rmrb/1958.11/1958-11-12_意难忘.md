    Unforgettable Feelings
    Li Jishen
    In commemoration of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's 92nd birthday; and written to the military and civilian compatriots in Taiwan.
    His achievements stand tall and majestic.
    Sweeping away the thousand-year-old imperial system,
    Creating the Republic.
    His foresight advocated alliance with the Communists,
    His prescience determined to learn from Russia.
    For the public good,
    Forever indelible.
    Having experienced so much frustration,
    Despite fulfilling his ambition and lifelong grand aspirations,
    Today surpasses that many times over.
    The glorious festival has just passed.
    As we mark his 92nd birthday,
    We should commemorate it with song.
    The peace camp is strong,
    Awe-inspiring to the demon of war.
    Striving for unification,
    Transforming hostility into peace.
    Patriotism admits no other belief.
    Hoping to seize the advantage of the east wind,
    To complete our mountains and rivers!

    意难忘
    李济深
    孙中山先生九二诞辰纪念；并告台湾军民同胞而作。
    功业嵯峨。
    扫千年帝制，
    缔造共和。
    远见倡联共，
    先觉定师俄。
    公天下，
    永不磨。
    历几许蹉跎，
    纵赉志、身前宏愿，
    今胜多多。
    光辉节日才过。
    值诞辰九二，
    纪念当歌。
    和平阵营壮，
    慑伏战争魔。
    谋统一，
    化干戈。
    爱国信无它。
    冀相趁、东风优势，
    完整山河！
