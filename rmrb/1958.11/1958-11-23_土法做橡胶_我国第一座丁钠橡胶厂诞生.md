    Indigenous Method for Making Rubber
    -- Birth of China's First Butadiene-Sodium Rubber Factory
    (By Our Own Correspondent) The Beijing Institute of Chemical Design, in collaboration with the Beijing Chemical Plant, has achieved preliminary success in experimenting with synthesizing butadiene-sodium rubber from alcohol. The factory built for this purpose has already commenced production.
    This factory was built using indigenous methods, referring to the basic principles of modern large-scale production in the Soviet Union, while taking into account China's current circumstances. The factory's production equipment and system are very simple. A modern synthetic rubber factory generally requires the installation of two to three hundred fairly complex pieces of equipment, while this factory has only about twenty pieces of equipment. Apart from some old iron cylinders, iron pipes, a blower with less than three horsepower, and ten or so simple instruments, there are no other "foreign devices." Apart from the blower for the furnace, which requires electricity, there is no other electrical equipment. Moreover, in places without electricity, a portable steam engine can be used as a power source. For the pressurization process, which is very important in production, modern factories need to install special electric compressors, but this factory has found a way to use a simplified device as a substitute. The furnace for producing butadiene originally required gas, but they have successfully experimented with an indigenous furnace that uses coal instead of gas.
    Due to the simple equipment and simplified production system, a factory with an annual output of twenty tons can be built in just one month, with an investment of no more than 20,000 yuan. Therefore, such factories are extremely easy to promote in the vast rural areas and towns.
    The successful trial production of butadiene-sodium rubber has opened up a new path for the comprehensive utilization of China's abundant agricultural products. This is because the raw material it uses is alcohol, and under the conditions of unprecedented bumper harvests of food crops in China, there is an abundance of alcohol raw materials everywhere.

    土法做橡胶
    ——我国第一座丁钠橡胶厂诞生
    本报讯　北京化工设计院协同北京化工厂用酒精合成丁钠橡胶的试验初步成功，所建的工厂已投入生产。
    这个厂是参照苏联现代化大生产的基本原理，根据我国目前情况采用土厂土法建成的。全厂生产设备和生产系统都很简单。一座近代化的合成橡胶厂，一般需要装设二、三百件相当复杂的设备，而这个厂只有二十来件设备，除了一些旧铁缸、输导铁管，一架不到三马力的鼓风机和十来个简单的仪表以外，再没有其他的“洋设备”了。除了烧炉用的鼓风机需要电力带动以外，再也没有第二个电动设备，而且在没有电的地方，还可用锅驼机作动力。在生产中很重要的加压工序，现代化工厂要装置特殊的电动压缩机，这个厂却设法利用简化了的装置来代替。生产丁二烯的炉子本来要用煤气，但他们试验成功一种土炉子，用烧煤代替了烧煤气。
    由于设备简易，生产系统简化，一个年产二十吨的厂，一个月就可建成，投资不过二万元。因此，这样的厂极便于在广大农村、城镇推广。
    丁钠橡胶的试制成功，给我国丰富的农产品的综合利用找到了一条新的道路。因为它所用的原料是酒精，在我国粮食作物空前丰产的条件下，到处都有丰富的酒精原料。
