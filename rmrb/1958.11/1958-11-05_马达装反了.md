    The Motor Was Installed Backwards
    Yang Ying
    A group of young students from a famous industrial university in Shanghai used scrap materials to install a small cupola furnace and a small converter furnace on the school's open ground, preparing to throw themselves into the battle of steelmaking. At midnight, the molten iron was ready, and the students were all in high spirits. Dozens of eyes were fixed on the tapping spout, but the molten iron refused to flow out at first. Later, it simply solidified into lumps in the furnace. The students couldn't figure out what the problem was. Finally, they invited the metallurgy professor who had guided the furnace installation. The professor looked and looked, touched and touched, but couldn't say what the problem was that the furnace temperature was not high enough. He walked around the furnace for almost a month, and finally found that the blower's air volume was too small. According to the professor, a cupola furnace that produces 1.5 tons of molten iron per hour would never be enough with a five-horsepower power supply, at least ten to fifteen horsepower would be needed. That is to say, another larger motor must be replaced, otherwise it will be difficult to produce iron and steel.
    This judgment did not discourage the young men. The students went to the factory and invited an old worker. The old worker looked at the furnace and immediately found that the blower motor was installed backwards, and the blades that generated the wind were rotating in the opposite direction, so the wind force was naturally small. Once the direction was corrected, the blower's wind force suddenly increased, the furnace roared, and the temperature immediately rose. The professor standing next to him immediately felt a burst of heat on his face, which turned red all the way to his ears. He stomped his feet and repeatedly cursed himself: "Damn it! Damn it!"
    I am telling this true story not to completely negate this professor. But, in fact, there are still quite a few such professors now. They are superstitious about book knowledge, despise manual labor, and think that the combination of education and productive labor will reduce the quality of teaching, and so on. They, like that blower, installed the motor backwards, resulting in nothing. This professor has a lot of theoretical knowledge, but why couldn't he even discover such a common-sense problem as the motor being installed backwards? Obviously, because he only has theoretical knowledge learned from books, very little practical knowledge, and is unwilling to practice. Therefore, when he talks, he is very knowledgeable and can also gesticulate from the sidelines, but when he does it, he makes a lot of jokes. People say that the furnace refines steel, and the furnace refines people. I hope that this kind of "high-level intellectual" without knowledge can learn the first lesson by the furnace.

    马达装反了
    杨瑛
    上海某著名工业大学一群青年学生，用废旧料在学校空地上安装了一座小化铁炉和一座小转炉，准备投入钢铁的战斗。到了夜半，铁水化好了，学生们个个精神抖擞，几十双眼睛注视着出铁口，可是铁水先是不肯流出来。后来干脆在炉里结成瘤子。学生们都摸不清毛病出在那里。最后，终于请来了指导安装炉子的冶金学教授。教授看了又看，摸了又摸，一时也说不出炉温不高的症结所在。他在炉子边转呀转的快个把月了，总算发现是鼓风机的风量太小，据教授说，按照常规，每小时出一点五吨铁水的化铁炉，五马力的动力设备是无论如何不够的，起码要十匹到十五匹。就是说，要另换一只大一点的马达，否则出铁炼钢就很难办到。
    这个判决并没有使小伙子们泄气。学生们又到工厂请来了一位老工人。那位老工人到炉子上看，马上发现是鼓风机的马达装反了，发生风力的叶片正向着反方向旋转，风力自然就小了。方向一端正，鼓风机的风力突然增大，炉子里呼呼作响，温度马上提高了。站在旁边的教授，顿时脸上一阵火热，面孔一直红到耳朵根。一面跺脚，一面连声骂自己：“混蛋！混蛋！”
    我叙述这个真实的故事，丝毫也不想把这位教授完全否定。但是，事实上，这样的教授现在也还不算太少。他们迷信书本知识，鄙视体力劳动，认为教育与生产劳动相结合会降低教学质量等等，不一而足。他们也像那个鼓风机一样，把马达装反了，结果一无所成。这位教授有不少理论知识，但是为什么连马达装反了这样的常识问题都发现不了呢？很显然，因为他只有从书本上学来的理论知识，实践的知识少得可怜，而又不愿意去实践。因此，讲起来头头是道，也能在旁边指手划脚，做起来，却笑话百出。人们说，炉里炼钢，炉旁炼人，但愿这种没有知识的“高级知识分子”在炉旁能炼了第一课。
