Look at the Today's Daur, Oroqen, and Evenk Nationalities
	Daur: Average of 2431 Jin of Grain per Person
	Oroqen: Establishing Iron and Steel Industry
	Evenk: Self-Made Ball Bearings
The Daur, Oroqen, and Evenk ethnic minorities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have made great strides in the Great Leap Forward, crossing several centuries. Industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production is developing at a high speed.

	Daur Nationality
The Daur nationality lives on the west bank of the Nenjiang River and the southeast foot of the Greater Khingan Mountains, with a current population of more than 40,000, an increase of 41% in eight years. In the past, cultivation was extensive and yields were low, and grain could not be self-sufficient. This year, farmers have invested in a large-scale upsurge of farmland water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and agricultural technology reform. The irrigated area of ​​farmland in the Daur Autonomous Banner has increased five times compared with last year, and full fertilization has been achieved in mountainous areas that have never had the habit of fertilization. A historically largest harvest finally appeared: the average harvest per person in the entire Daur Autonomous Banner was 2,431 jin. Now, the entire banner has rapidly realized the people's commune system and all-people militarization.
	Before liberation, this banner had only three handicraft factories, and this year 1,400 factories have emerged, and more than 300 ethnic professional workers have been trained.
	This year, the total number of livestock in the banner has increased by 25% compared with last year. Primary school education has been popularized in ethnic minority settlements, and the number of middle school students has greatly increased. Every commune and village has set up radio stations, clubs, libraries, hospitals, maternity stations, and health clinics.

	Oroqen Nationality
The Oroqen nationality, who have lived in the forests of the Greater Khingan Mountains for generations and lived by hunting, have seen fewer and fewer wild animals in the forests. Recently, the Oroqen Autonomous Banner Party Committee and government decided to vigorously develop deer breeding and prepare to establish artificial breeding farms for precious wild animals. At the same time, in addition to hunting wild animals, some hunters have begun to engage in agricultural, animal husbandry, and sideline businesses. This year, the entire banner planted 3,750 mu of grain and vegetables, and has already achieved a bumper harvest.
	There has never been a factory here. Now, hunters are cooperating with local ethnic workers and residents to run 40 factories. In recent days, they have also organized iron and steel companies to establish an iron and steel industry.
	The Oroqen people have always lived by hunting, and this year they have realized cooperation and settled hunting. They abandoned the primitive "Xianrenzhu" (a simple dwelling built with birch bark or roe deer skin) and moved into newly built houses. In the comfortable new settlement villages, adult hunters are learning culture, and all school-age children have entered school. Hospitals, health teams, cultural centers, and film projection teams have been established. Tetanus, puerperal fever, measles, and other infectious diseases, which were the most harmful in the past, have been basically eliminated or controlled. Eight years ago, there were only more than 900 Oroqen people, and now the population has increased to more than 2,200.

	Evenk Nationality
The Evenk nationality is also a nomadic hunting people, with a total of 6,200 people. Here, there was no industry in the past, but recently 200 factories have emerged. The newly built Red Flag Iron and Wood Factory has begun to repair and manufacture various vehicles and grass mowers for herdsmen. The ball bearing factory has produced ball bearings for grassland lele carts. After popularization, it can greatly reduce the number of draught animals and increase transportation capacity. A woolen mill called "Leap Forward" produces various woolen products for herdsmen. Now, the first batch of Evenk, Mongolian, and Daur workers have been born in the Evenk Autonomous Banner.
	In recent years, the total number of livestock in the Evenk Autonomous Banner has increased to more than 140,000, a net increase of 78% to 100% compared with 1949. The construction of feed bases and settlements on the grasslands is also developing rapidly. The commercial network has spread to every sumu (district), and postal and telecommunications are available in the central points of the banner. 85% of the herdsmen's children in the banner have entered schools, and most of the original young and middle-aged illiterates have become cultured people. Evenk, Mongolian, and other ethnic women often take advantage of their rest time to hold books and study happily. This year, the average purchasing power of the autonomous banner is 173 yuan per person, nearly seven times higher than five years ago.

    请看今日的达斡尔、鄂伦春、鄂温克民族
    达斡尔：每人平均粮食2431斤
    鄂伦春：建立钢铁工业
    鄂温克：自制滚珠轴承
    内蒙古自治区内的达斡尔、鄂伦春、鄂温克三个少数民族，在大跃进中，跨过几个世纪，阔步前进。工、农、牧业生产高速度向前发展。
    达斡尔族
    达斡尔族居住在嫩江西岸、大兴安岭东南麓，现有四万多人口，八年中增加了41％。过去耕作粗放，广种薄收，粮食不能自给自足。今年农民们投入了大规模兴修农田水利、积肥、农业技术改革高潮。达斡尔自治旗农田灌溉面积比去年增加了五倍，从来没有施肥习惯的山区都实现了满粪化。一个历史上最大的丰收，终于出现了：全达斡尔族自治旗平均每人收获量是二千四百三十一斤。现在，全旗已迅速地实现了人民公社化和全民军事化。
    这个旗在解放前只有三个手工业工厂，今年涌现了一千四百座工厂。并培养出三百多名民族专业工人。
    全旗今年各种牲畜比去年增加了25％。各民族聚居区普及了小学教育，中学生人数大大增加。每个公社和村庄都办起了广播站、俱乐部、图书室、医院、接生站和保健室。
    鄂伦春族
    祖祖辈辈生活在大兴安岭森林里的鄂伦春民族，狩猎为生，森林中野兽越打越少，最近鄂伦春自治旗党委和政府决定大办养鹿业，准备建立珍贵野生动物人工饲养场。同时，猎民们除猎捕野兽外，一部分人开始经营农牧副业。今年全旗种植三千七百五十亩粮食、蔬菜，已经获得丰收。
    这里从来没有出现过一个工厂。现在猎人们同当地各民族职工居民合作，办起了四十个工厂。最近几天来他们还组织了钢铁连，要建立钢铁工业。
    鄂伦春人从来以游猎为生，今年实现了合作化和定居游猎。他们撇下原始的“仙人柱”（一种用桦树皮或狍皮搭盖起来的简陋住屋），搬进了新建的房舍。在安适的定居新村里，成年的猎人学习着文化，所有的学龄儿童都进了学校。医院、卫生队、文化馆、电影队建立起来了，过去为害最严重的破伤风、产褥热、麻疹等传染病已经基本消灭或被控制。八年前，鄂伦春只有九百多人，目前已增长到两千两百多人。
    鄂温克族
    鄂温克族也是个游猎民族，共有六千二百人。这里，过去没有工业，新近出现了二百座工厂。新建的红旗铁木工厂，已开始给牧民修理和制造各种车辆和打草机。滚珠轴承厂制成了草原勒勒车用的滚珠轴承，推广后可大量减少役用牲畜，提高运输力。一座名叫“跃进”的毛织厂，为牧民生产着各种毛织品。现在，第一批鄂温克、蒙古、达斡尔族工人已在鄂温克族自治旗诞生。
    几年来鄂温克自治旗牲畜总头数增加到十四万多头，与1949年比较，纯增78％到100％。草原上的饲料基地和定居建设也在迅速发展中。商业网已遍及每个苏木（区），邮电通全旗中心点。全旗85％的牧民子弟进了学校，原来的青壮年文盲绝大部分变成了有文化的人。鄂温克、蒙古等族妇女，常常利用休息时间，捧着书本，愉快地学习着。今年自治旗平均每人购买力是一百七十三元，比五年前提高近七倍。
