The Chinese People's Delegation, carrying the love and friendship of the Chinese people for the Korean people, went to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the grand "Sino-Korean Friendship Month" activities. From September 29th to October 26th, the duration was twenty-eight days. We participated in large-scale activities such as the opening ceremony of "Sino-Korean Friendship Month", the founding assembly of the "Sino-Korean Friendship Association" and the farewell rally for the returning Chinese People's Volunteers. We visited many heroic cities, including Kaesong, Huichon, Wonsan, Hamhung, Hungnam, Nampo, and Supung, in addition to the capital, Pyongyang; we visited factories, enterprises, agricultural production cooperatives, aquatic product enterprises, and cultural and educational institutions; we participated in many cultural and artistic evenings. We also visited heroic People's Army units and representatives of families of martyrs and military personnel. We also visited Panmunjom and other scenic spots and historical sites. During the delegation's twenty-eight days in Korea, we received meticulous care and enthusiastic welcome from the Korean Labor Party, the Republic's government, and all brotherly Korean people, led by Premier Kim Il-sung. The national flags of China and Korea were intertwined everywhere, and "Long Live Sino-Korean Friendship" was cheered everywhere. Countless moving scenes moved us deeply.

We were very pleased to see the Korean people, united around the Korean Labor Party, the Republic's government, and Premier Kim Il-sung, demonstrating a high degree of patriotic labor enthusiasm, and achieving very great achievements in the post-war economic recovery and socialist construction. The three-year war brought extremely serious destruction and losses to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The heroic Korean people did not bow their heads in the face of difficulties. They healed the wounds of war and rebuilt their motherland and homes at the fastest speed. We personally saw all the Korean cities and rural areas, which had been razed to the ground by the American invaders, rebuilt with a new look. Factory chimneys in the industrial zones stood tall like bamboo shoots after a rain! The scenic, fertile, and resource-rich northern Korea is even more beautiful than before the war. Only five years after the armistice, almost no traces of the war could be seen in all the places we visited.

After successfully completing the post-war three-year plan, the Korean people are indeed riding the Chollima, striving to complete the first five-year plan more than a year and a half ahead of schedule. The Pyongyang Textile Factory, Huichon Underground Machinery Factory, Precision Machinery Factory, Supung Hydroelectric Power Station, Hwanghae Iron Works, Nampo Smelting Plant, Wonsan Railway Factory, Hungnam Fertilizer Factory, and Taean Electric Factory, which we visited successively, were either newly restored or completely newly built. They are large in scale, modern in equipment, and have greatly improved labor productivity. The workers in various factories are all working with soaring enthusiasm, repeatedly overfulfilling and completing production tasks ahead of schedule. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has abundant natural resources and sufficient electric and water power. Many industries have achieved electrification. Many industrial finished products are exported to our country and other brotherly countries. From here, we can not only see the heroic spirit of the Korean people, but also see the high degree of development of the spirit of mutual assistance between socialist brotherly countries. Premier Kim Il-sung said at the Korean National Day celebration: "This year, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will produce 8.6 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 400,000 tons of steel, more than 450,000 tons of chemical fertilizers, 1.2 million tons of cement, and 120 million meters of fabric. Korea's original most backward machinery industry has also developed to 29 times that of 1946." In terms of population ratio, these figures are already quite astonishing. But they are not satisfied with these figures. Taking steel as an example, they plan to reach an annual output of one million tons soon, and within a few years, they want to reach an annual output of three million tons. Premier Kim Il-sung told us: "The industrial products of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea this year will be 4.7 times more than ten years ago. By the time the first five-year plan is completed, the output of Korea's main industrial products, in terms of population ratio, will definitely exceed that of Japan." We cannot but congratulate our Korean brothers on their achievements in industrial production.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has also achieved great victories in agricultural collectivization. This year, their grain output will exceed the target of the last year of the first five-year plan three years ahead of schedule. In 1956 and 1957, Korea's agricultural products achieved bumper harvests. This year's grain output can reach 3.8 million tons, an increase of 600,000 tons over last year and more than one million tons over ten years ago. All grain can be self-sufficient. The Sampong-ri Agricultural Cooperative in Pyongwon County and the "Sino-Korean Friendship" Agricultural Cooperative in Kimchon County, which has twice won the title of Republic Model Agricultural Cooperative, gave us a very deep impression. There, we saw lush crops and abundant apples everywhere, filled with songs and laughter. The chairman of the "Sino-Korean Friendship" Agricultural Cooperative told us: "This year, each household can receive 3,000 kilograms of grain and 25,000 Korean won. A life of ample food and clothing has begun to be realized. We are full of confidence and are striving for a more beautiful and happy life!" We cannot but congratulate our Korean brothers on their achievements in agricultural production.

With the recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production, the people's living standards in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have greatly improved, and scenes of ample food and clothing can be seen everywhere. As a result, culture and education have been highly developed. Middle schools have implemented compulsory education. Since the war, the excellent tradition of combining education and labor has been maintained and developed. Folk art activities are very common. Everywhere we go, there is dancing and singing. This situation forms a strong contrast with southern Korea under the occupation of the American aggressor troops. We once stood on the military demarcation line in Panmunjom and saw that in the north, which is close to the military demarcation line, the golden rice fields were like undulating waves, and the farmers were happily carrying out the autumn harvest; while in the south under the occupation of the American aggressor troops, it was desolate and lifeless. Separated by only a line, one side is a bright world, and the other side is a dark and dismal world; one side is a thriving scene of peace, and the other side is a lifeless and uninhabited area. Anyone who comes here can personally see the criminal acts committed by the American aggressors on Korean soil; they can personally see the great contributions made by the heroic Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Labor Party, in promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. This is the most vivid teaching material. It declares to the world: the unparalleled superiority and vitality of the socialist system, and the inevitable trend of the capitalist system towards decline and death. It declares to the world: peace will surely defeat war. Victory will surely belong to the Korean people who are unremittingly fighting for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

During the "Sino-Korean Friendship Month" activities, the delegation also visited the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers and, on behalf of the people of the whole country, visited and welcomed our most beloved people who were about to return home. We can tell everyone that the Chinese People's Volunteers are worthy of being the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people. During the three years of arduous war and the five years of equally arduous recovery and construction, they irrigated the beautiful land of Korea with blood and hot sweat, and successfully completed the sacred historical mission entrusted to them by the people of the motherland: "Resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country." They resolutely implemented the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao: "Cherish every mountain, every river, every tree, and every blade of grass in Korea." During and after the war, they selflessly assisted the brotherly Korean people in rebuilding their homes and promoting socialist construction. Even before the final withdrawal from Korea, every comrade was still under the slogan of "Do more for the Korean people," "Dig one more shovel of soil," and "Carry one more basket of firewood," building dikes and dams for the Korean people, building reservoirs, repairing highways, building bridges, repairing houses, building schools, and helping farmers with autumn harvesting, weeding, and planting trees.... Therefore, they were sincerely loved by all the Korean people and won high international honors. Lee Ok-seon, the wife of Park Jae-geun, a great internationalist fighter of Korea, said to the comrades of our delegation: "The kindness of the Chinese People's Volunteers to the Korean people can never be fully expressed. Even if we weave our hair into shoes for the Volunteer comrades to wear, it is difficult to express our love for the Volunteers." We deeply thank the Korean Labor Party, the Republic's government, and all the Korean people for spending eight months, with unprecedented enthusiasm, sending off batches of Volunteers back to their country. Many Korean old men and old women gave their family heirlooms, passed down for generations, and their beloved items, which they had tried their best to rescue from the flames of war and had been treasured by their side, to the Volunteer soldiers. Countless heroic Korean people shed tears of farewell. We personally witnessed the situation on October 25 when the leading comrades of the Volunteer Headquarters and the last batch of Volunteer comrades left Pyongyang. Three hundred thousand people lined the streets to see them off, flowers and ribbons flew all over the sky, and the cheers of "Long live" soared into the clouds. This made us deeply realize that the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, cemented with blood, is indeed a brilliant example of great internationalism. This brotherly friendship between the people, constantly developing under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, is forever invincible.

The Chinese People's Delegation went to Korea with the gratitude and love of the Chinese people for the heroic Korean people, and now returns to the motherland with the deep friendship of the Korean people for our people. Everything we saw during our visit to Korea makes us firmly believe that the Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Labor Party and the Republic's government, headed by Premier Kim Il-sung, will surely be able to successfully complete the cause of building socialism, and the three thousand miles of beautiful rivers and mountains will surely achieve peaceful reunification. In particular, through the "Sino-Korean Friendship Month" activities, the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, cemented with blood, has been further strengthened. Our Chinese and Korean people have common enemies and common tasks. We thank the Korean people for their full support for our sacred task of liberating Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, and we will always support the Korean people's just cause of peacefully reunifying their motherland. The Chinese People's Volunteers have all withdrawn to China, and the American aggressor troops cannot赖在朝鲜南部不走 [this is a very strong term and is difficult to translate directly, but it suggests clinging on or refusing to leave] in southern Korea. Our two countries, China and Korea, have ample experience and strength to defeat American imperialism. We will always help each other, encourage each other, learn from each other, jointly defend peace in Asia and the world, and advance victoriously along the broad road of socialism!

Long live the unbreakable fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, cemented with blood!
Long live the consolidated unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
Long live world peace!

    难忘的访问　永恒的友谊
    中国人民代表团赴朝参加“朝中友好月”活动工作报告
    中国人民代表团团长　郭沫若
    中国人民代表团带着全国人民对朝鲜人民的热爱和友情，到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国去参加了盛大的“朝中友好月”的活动。从9月29日起至10月26日止，为时共二十八天。我们参加了“朝中友好月”开幕大会、“朝中友好协会”成立大会和欢送志愿军回国大会等规模宏大的活动。我们访问了许多英雄城市，除首都平壤之外，我们到过开城、熙川、元山、咸兴、兴南、南浦、水丰等地；参观了好些工厂、企业、农业生产合作社、水产事业所和文化教育机关；参加了不少次的文艺晚会。我们还访问了英雄的人民军部队和烈、军家属的代表。我们也参观了板门店和其他名胜古迹。代表团在朝鲜的二十八天中，每天都受到以金日成首相为首的朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和全体兄弟般的朝鲜人民无微不至的关怀和热情欢迎。到处都交插着中朝两国的国旗，到处都在欢呼“朝中友谊万岁”。无数动人的场面，使我们十分感动。
    我们非常高兴地看到了团结在朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和金日成首相周围的朝鲜人民，发扬了爱国主义的高度的劳动热情，在战后恢复经济、建设社会主义的过程中取得了非常伟大的成就。三年的战争，给朝鲜民主主义人民共和国带来了极其严重的破坏和损失。英雄的朝鲜人民在困难的面前并没有低头。他们以最快的速度医治了战争创伤，重建了自己的祖国和家园。我们亲眼看到被美国侵略者夷为废墟的所有的朝鲜城市和农村，都以崭新的面貌重新建设起来了。工厂地带的烟囱像雨后春笋般地耸立起来了！山明水秀、鱼米富饶的朝鲜北部，比战前更加美丽了。停战仅仅五年，凡我们所到过的地方差不多已经看不到战争的痕迹了。
    朝鲜人民在胜利地完成了战后三年计划之后，目前的确是跨上了千里马，正在努力争取提前一年半以上完成第一个五年计划。我们先后参观访问了的平壤纺织厂、熙川地下机械厂、精密机械厂、水丰发电站、黄海制铁所、南浦冶炼所、元山铁路工厂、兴南化肥厂、大安电气厂等等，都是从新恢复或者完全是新建起来的。规模宏大，设备新式，劳动生产率都有很大的提高。各个工厂的工人同志们，都在以冲天干劲，一再超额和提前完成生产任务。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的自然资源丰富，电力水力充足，很多工业都已实现了电气化。工业成品有不少的产量是向我国和其他兄弟国家输出的。我们从这里不仅可以看到朝鲜人民的英雄气概，并可以看到社会主义兄弟国家之间的互助精神的高度发扬。金日成首相在朝鲜国庆庆祝会上说：“今年朝鲜民主主义人民共和国将生产八十六亿瓩时电力、四十万吨钢、四十五万吨以上的化学肥料、一百二十万吨水泥和一亿二千万公尺的布匹。朝鲜原来最落后的机械工业也已经发展到1946年的二十九倍”。按人口比例来看，这些数字已经是相当惊人的了。但是他们并不以这些数字为满足。即以钢为例，他们准备很快达到年产一百万吨，并在几年之内，要达到年产三百万吨。金日成首相告诉我们说：“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国今年的工业产品，将比十年前多四点七倍，到第一个五年计划完成的时候，朝鲜的工业主要产品的产量，按人口比例一定能够超过日本”。我们不能不为朝鲜兄弟在工业生产上的成就表示庆贺。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在农业合作化方面，同样获得了伟大的胜利。他们今年的粮食产量就将提前三年超过第一个五年计划最后一年的指标。1956年和1957年朝鲜的农产品都获得了丰收，今年的粮食产量可达到三百八十万吨，比去年增产了六十万吨，比十年前增加了一百万吨以上。全部粮食可以自给自足了。我们参观过的平元郡三峰里农业合作社和曾经两次荣获共和国模范农社称号的金川郡的“朝中友谊”农业合作社，给了我们很深刻的印象。在那里，我们看到了到处都是茂盛的庄稼、累累的苹果，充满着歌声和欢笑声。“朝中友谊”农业合作社的委员长告诉我们：“今年每户就可以分得三千公斤粮食和两万五千元朝币，丰衣足食的生活已经开始实现。正充满信心地为更加美满幸福的生活前景而奋斗！”我们不能不为朝鲜兄弟在农业生产上的成就表示庆贺。
    随着工农业生产的恢复和发展，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的人民生活有了很大的改善，丰衣足食的景象到处可以看到。因而文化教育有了高度的发展。中学已经实施了义务教育，从战争时期以来，教育和劳动结合的优良传统一直被保留而且有了发展。民间的艺术活动是十分普遍的，我们所到的地方，四处都是跳舞和歌声。这种情况和在美国侵略军占领下的朝鲜南部形成了强烈的对照。我们曾经站在板门店军事分界线上看过，在紧接军事分界线的北部，金黄的稻谷犹如起伏的海浪，农民们愉快地进行着秋收；而在美国侵略军占领下的南部，则是一片荒芜，死气沉沉。仅隔一条线，一边是光明的世界，一边是暗无天日的世界；一边是欣欣向荣的和平景象，一边是死气沉沉的无人地区。无论是谁来到这里，都可以亲眼看到美国侵略者在朝鲜土地上所犯的罪恶行为；都可以亲眼看到在朝鲜劳动党领导下的英雄的朝鲜人民在促进祖国的和平统一、维护亚洲和世界和平方面所作的巨大贡献。这是最鲜明的形象教材。它向全世界宣告着：社会主义制度的无比的优越性和生命力，资本主义制度的必然趋向于没落和死亡。它向全世界宣告着：和平一定能够战胜战争。胜利一定属于为和平统一祖国而奋斗不懈的朝鲜人民。
    代表团在参加“朝中友好月”活动期间，也访问了中国人民志愿军总部，代表全国人民看望了并迎接了即将全部回国的我们最可爱的人。我们可以告慰大家的是：中国人民志愿军不愧是中国人民最优秀的儿女。在三年艰苦的战争岁月里和五年同样艰苦的恢复建设岁月里，他们用鲜血和热汗灌溉了美丽的朝鲜的土地，圆满地完成了祖国人民所交予他们的“抗美援朝，保家卫国”的神圣的历史使命。他们坚决执行了伟大领袖毛主席“爱护朝鲜的一山一水、一草一木”的指示，在战中和战后，都以忘我的劳动协助了兄弟的朝鲜人民重建家园，推进社会主义建设。即使在最后撤离朝鲜之前，每个同志都还在“多为朝鲜人民做点事”、“多挖一锹土”、“多背一筐柴”的口号下，为朝鲜人民修堤筑坝、建设水库，修公路、筑桥梁、修房屋、盖校舍，帮助农民秋收、除草、植树……。因而，受到了全体朝鲜人民衷心的爱戴。获得了崇高的国际荣誉。朝鲜伟大的国际主义战士朴在根烈士的妻子李玉善对我们代表团的同志们说：“中国人民志愿军对朝鲜人民的恩情，是永远也说不完的，我们就是把头发编成鞋子给志愿军同志穿，也难以表达我们热爱志愿军的心意。”我们深深感谢朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民，费了八个月的工夫，以空前未有的热诚，欢送了一批又一批的志愿军回国。许多朝鲜老大爷、老大娘把自己祖传几代的传家宝，和在战火中千方百计抢救出来、一直珍藏在身边的心爱物品赠送给了志愿军战士。无数英雄的朝鲜人民都纷纷流出了惜别的热泪。10月25日志愿军司令部的领导同志们和最后一批志愿军同志们离开平壤的情况，我们是亲眼看见的。有三十万群众夹道欢送，鲜花彩带满天飞舞，万岁的欢呼声高入云霄。这使我们深深体验到：中朝两国人民以鲜血凝结成的战斗友谊确实是伟大的国际主义的光辉典范，这种在马克思列宁主义旗帜下不断发展着的兄弟般的人民友谊，是永远不可战胜的。
    中国人民代表团带着中国人民对英雄的朝鲜人民的感谢和热爱去到朝鲜，现在又带着朝鲜人民对我国人民的深情厚谊回到祖国来了。我们在朝鲜进行访问中所看到的一切，使我们深信，朝鲜人民在以金日成首相为首的朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府的领导下，一定能够顺利地完成建设社会主义的事业，三千里锦绣江山必将获得和平统一。特别是通过“朝中友好月”的活动，中朝两国人民以鲜血凝成的战斗友谊，是更进一步加强了。我们中朝两国人民有着共同的敌人和共同的任务。我们感谢朝鲜人民对于我们解放台、澎、金、马的神圣任务的全力支持，我们也始终支持朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的正义事业。中国人民志愿军已经全部撤回中国了，美国的侵略军队不能赖在朝鲜南部不走。我们中朝两国有着打败美帝国主义的充足的经验和力量，我们将永远互相帮助、互相勉励、互相学习，共同保卫亚洲和世界的和平，沿着社会主义的康庄大道胜利前进！
    中朝两国人民以鲜血凝结成的牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营巩固的团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
