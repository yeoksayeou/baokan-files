Xinhua News Agency, November 27th – The Ministry of Public Security convened a National Capital Construction Site Fire Prevention Work On-site Meeting in Beijing from the 17th to the 27th. The meeting believes that with the large-scale capital construction currently unfolding across the country and the substantial increase in winter construction tasks, fire prevention work at construction sites must keep pace.

This on-site meeting mainly involved visiting and learning from Beijing's experience in fire prevention work at capital construction sites. This year, Beijing's capital construction tasks have doubled compared to last year, but the number of fires at capital construction sites has decreased by 35.3% compared to last year, and the losses caused by fires have decreased by 87.8%. Many fire-free units have emerged throughout the city, including the Beijing Fourth Construction Engineering Company, which has not had a fire for six years. While the fire prevention awareness of the broad masses has greatly improved, the city has basically established a professional and voluntary fire fighting force capable of fulfilling its responsibilities. The fundamental key to Beijing's achievements is relying on the leadership of the Party, implementing the mass line, and establishing the viewpoint of serving production. In concrete practice, special attention is paid to close cooperation between public security departments and construction departments, twisting production, construction, and fire safety into one rope, and putting forward the slogan of "Production must be safe, and safety is for production." Secondly, the policy of "all people running fire prevention" has been conscientiously implemented. Mass fire prevention discussions, debates, appraisals, and publicity activities are frequently carried out at various construction sites, forming a situation of "everyone preventing fires, always preventing fires, and everywhere preventing fires."

During the meeting, Luo Ruiqing, Minister of Public Security, attended and spoke. The meeting was concluded by Yang Qiqing, Deputy Minister of Public Security. He said that with the widespread development of industry, steel production, and the communization of the people's communes, fire prevention work must be taken seriously. Winter and spring are seasons with relatively severe fires, and all of this determines that fire prevention work this winter and next spring must be greatly strengthened. He requested that everyone, under the unified leadership and arrangements of Party committees and people's committees at all levels, combine with the central work, revolve around production, and launch a mass fire prevention movement as an important part of the safety movement.

    人人防火时时防火处处防火
    公安部召开全国基建消防工作现场会议
    据新华社27日讯　公安部17日到27日在北京召开了全国基本建设工地消防工作现场会议。会议认为：在目前全国到处展开大规模的基本建设和冬季施工任务大量增加的情况下，工地的消防工作必须跟上去。
    这一次现场会议主要是参观和学习北京市基本建设工地消防工作的经验。北京市今年基本建设任务比去年增加一倍，但基本建设工地上的火灾次数却比去年减少35.3％，火灾造成的损失减少了87.8％。全市出现了许多个没有火灾的单位，其中北京市第四建筑工程公司已有六年没有发生火灾。在广大群众防火警惕性大大提高的同时，全市已经基本上建立起一支能够胜任的专职和义务相结合的消防队伍。北京市取得成绩的基本关键是依靠党的领导、贯彻执行群众路线和树立为生产服务的观点，而在具体实践中又特别注意做到公安部门和建筑部门密切协作，把生产、施工和消防安全扭成一股绳，提出了
  “生产必须安全，安全为了生产”的口号。其次是切实贯彻执行了“全民办消防”的方针，各个工地经常开展群众性的防火鸣放辩论、评比、宣传、形成了“人人防火、时时防火、处处防火”的局面。
    在会议期间，公安部部长罗瑞卿到会讲了话。会议最后由公安部副部长杨奇清作了总结。他说，随着工业遍地开花，钢铁生产和人民公社化的发展，必须重视防火工作。而冬春季节又是火灾比较严重的季节，所有这些决定了今冬明春的防火工作必须大大加强。他要求大家在各级党委和人民委员会的统一领导和安排下，结合中心工作，围绕生产，掀起一个群众性的防火运动，作为安全运动的重要内容。
