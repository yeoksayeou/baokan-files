Xinhua News Agency News: The entire medical staff of the Nanjing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated Hospital actively promoted the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine and recently collectively compiled China's first book on traditional Chinese medicine nursing, comprising more than 300,000 words, and TCM nursing routines for more than 30 kinds of diseases.

According to traditional Chinese medicine and the traditional characteristics of the integration of medicine and nursing, the entire medical staff of the Nanjing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated Hospital summarized the clinical experience of many veteran doctors over decades and the data accumulated by the hospital over the past four years, widely collected folk nursing knowledge and ancient literature records, and systematically wrote the TCM nursing science, which had never existed in China throughout the past dynasties.

TCM nursing is divided into general principles and specific discussions. The general principles describe the basic theories of traditional Chinese medicine, general nursing methods of traditional Chinese medicine, such as mental nursing, dietary dos and don'ts, condition observation, and 13 kinds of therapies and operations such as acupuncture, cupping, massage, and qigong therapy. The specific discussions also describe the clinical knowledge and nursing techniques of 128 kinds of diseases in various departments, and include the properties, dosages, and prescriptions of commonly used Chinese medicines.

The content of TCM nursing is rich and the text is easy to understand, making it suitable as a textbook for TCM nursing schools and also a good reference book for Western medicine doctors and nurses to learn TCM nursing. It has now been published by People's Publishing House.
