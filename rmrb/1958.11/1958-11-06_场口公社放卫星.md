Changkou Commune Launches a Satellite

(Reported by this newspaper) In Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, the Changkou People's Commune has launched a vigorous mass movement to smelt copper using indigenous methods. Tens of thousands of people are working day and night. So far, the commune has more than 180 indigenous furnaces flowing with molten copper. From 5:00 AM on October 21st to 5:00 AM on October 22nd, they launched a high-yield "satellite" with a daily output of 1.88 tons. This day's output was more than six times the previous average daily output. The commune is now vigorously mining copper ore, preparing to launch a "satellite" with a daily output of ten tons by the end of the month, with a planned copper production of 300 tons by the end of the year. The CPC Jiande Prefectural Committee is holding an on-site copper smelting meeting in Fuyang County to summarize and promote the experience of the Changkou People's Commune in developing mass copper smelting using indigenous methods.

    本报讯　浙江省富阳县场口人民公社掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的全民土法炼铜运动。万人炼铜大军日夜奋战。这个社到目前止，有一百八十多只土炉铜水畅流。10月21日上午五时到22日上午五时还放出了日产一点八八吨的高产卫星，这一天的产量比以前的平均日产量猛增六倍多。这个社现在正在大力开采铜矿，准备在月底放出日产十吨的高产卫星，到年底计划产铜三百吨。中共建德地委正在富阳县召开炼铜现场会，总结和推广场口人民公社发展全民搞土法炼铜的经验。（附图片）
