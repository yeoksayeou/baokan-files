Xinhua News Agency, November 17th: On the basis of the great leap forward in forestry production this year, the speed of afforestation and the amount of timber production nationwide will be accelerated and increased next year to ensure the needs of the high-speed development of socialist construction.

The national winter conference of forestry bureau directors, convened by the Ministry of Forestry in Beijing, concluded on the 13th. The conference summarized the achievements of this year's great leap forward in forestry production and discussed the national forestry tasks for next year. During the conference, Vice Chairman Zhu De attended and gave important instructions. Chen Zhengren, Deputy Director of the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting.

The conference pointed out that this year on the forestry production front, there are many different characteristics compared to previous years: afforestation and planting trees around houses and along roads and rivers are more numerous, faster, and of better quality; many tools have been reformed in harvesting and transportation; harvesting and forest management have been combined; particularly noteworthy is the emergence of examples of large-scale rapid and high-yield forest production. To date, more than 450 million mu of land have been afforested nationwide; 20 billion trees have been planted around houses and along roads and rivers; the timber production task has been completed 85% for the year; and more than 500 million jin of seeds have been collected. The conference emphasized the need to vigorously develop the timber processing industry; establish bases for woody oil plants; and forestry departments at all levels should help people's communes incorporate forestry production into the overall production plan of the commune. While focusing on timber production, it is imperative to focus on capital construction. Regeneration in large forest areas must keep up with harvesting, to prevent the phenomenon of losing forest as we harvest.

Landscaping is a major event of great concern to the people nationwide. Preliminary opinions on the content, principles, and planning of landscaping were put forward at this conference. The meeting believes that the realization of landscaping in urban and rural areas nationwide is the direction of forestry work in the future.

In order to ensure the realization of various leap forward targets for forestry production next year, the conference believes that forestry departments at all levels must, under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, grasp the characteristics of forestry work, carry out mass movements, use large movements to drive small movements, and combine regular and concentrated efforts. In the situation of comprehensive and rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, forestry work must keep up and squeeze in, otherwise it will hold back progress. The conference requested that forestry workers at all levels must strengthen communist education. Facts have proved that where there is more communist thought, there will be more miracles.

    林业生产要纳入人民公社规划
    全国林业厅局长会议提出努力目标
    据新华社17日讯　在今年林业生产大跃进的基础上，明年全国绿化速度和木材生产数量将加快加大，以保证社会主义建设高速度发展的需要。
    林业部在北京召开的全国林业厅局长冬季会议已于13日结束。会议总结了今年林业生产大跃进的成绩，讨论了明年全国的林业任务。会议期间，朱德副主席到会作了重要指示。中共中央农村工作部副部长陈正人在会上讲了话。
    会议指示今年在林业生产战线上，有许多与往年不同的特点：造林和四旁植树又多又快，质量较好；采伐和运输方面改革了不少工具；采伐与营林结合起来了；特别值得注意的是出现了大面积的林木快速丰产与高额丰产的范例。到目前为止，全国已造林四亿五千多万亩；四旁植树二百亿株；木材生产任务已完成全年的85％；采种已达五亿多斤。会议强调要大力发展木材加工业；建立木本油料基地；各级林业工作部门要帮助人民公社把林业生产纳入公社的全面生产规划中去。在抓木材生产的同时，一定要抓紧基本建设。大林区中的更新要紧跟上采伐，防止采一片，少一片的现象。
    园林化是全国人民非常关心的一件大事。这次会议上对园林化的内容、原则和规划提出了初步意见。会议认为，全国城乡实现园林化是今后林业工作的方向。
    为了保证实现明年林业生产的各项跃进指标，会议认为，各级林业工作部门必须在各级党委统一领导下抓住林业工作的特点，开展群众运动，以大运动套小运动，经常与突击相结合的办法，在工农业生产全面飞速发展的形势下，林业工作必须跟上去，挤进去，不然就会拖后腿。会议要求各级林业工作人员必须加强共产主义教育，事实证明，哪里共产主义思想多一点，哪里就会出现奇迹。
