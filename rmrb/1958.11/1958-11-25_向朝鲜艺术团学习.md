Learning from the Korean Art Troupe
    Qian Junrui

    The diligent, brave, and talented Korean people are now striding forward on the "Chollima," leaping ahead on the road of socialist construction. Their tremendous achievements in economic and cultural construction are receiving warm applause and praise from the Chinese people. The spirit of hard struggle displayed by our brotherly Korean people on all fronts is worthy of our earnest study. Their efforts and achievements in culture and art are, of course, no exception.

    The visit and performance of the Art Troupe from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to our country this time is a major event in the cultural exchange between China and Korea and in our cultural life. Their excellent performances will undoubtedly further develop and consolidate the lofty friendship between the Chinese and Korean people forged in blood, and at the same time provide a good example for Chinese artists.

    The most prominent feature of the Korean Art Troupe's performance is their ability to reflect real-life struggles and life promptly and effectively. Their male chorus "Soldiers' Song" and the dance "Meeting on the Heights" successfully depict the revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism of the people's soldiers, and powerfully express the militant friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. The female chorus "Song of the Weaving Women" and the kayagum singing "Spinning Wheel Song" use very beautiful notes to praise the labor and life of textile workers. It is particularly worth mentioning the exhilarating dance "Iron Water Flows" and "Celebrating the Harvest." The former is a beautiful combination of a group of strong male dancers and another group of fairy-like female dancers, symbolizing the magnificent scene of a torrent of molten iron flowing and iron flowers splashing. The latter uses a light and gentle pace to express the joy of Korean farmers over the high and abundant harvest of various agricultural products. The ability of Korean artists to reflect so quickly and effectively the leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, thereby promoting a greater leap forward in production, is particularly worthy of serious study by Chinese artists.

    The comrades of the Art Troupe of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea skillfully used national forms to express the new life of the people, and were able to bring forth the new from the old. What a fresh and beautiful feeling the dance "Fan Dance" gives people! The kayagum singing, with its light songs and clear tones, brings people into a realm of tranquility, purity, and nobility.

    With their deep friendship and love for the Chinese people, the Korean brothers and sisters, like family members, warmly sang Chinese songs and performed Chinese dances. With the same hatred for American imperialism and the firm belief that the Chinese people will surely achieve victory, they sang "We must plant the flag of victory on Taiwan." They sang "Three Sets of Yellow Cattle and One Set of Horses" and "Erlang Mountain" as if they were working and living with Chinese workers and peasants. They also performed folk songs and dances of many of China's minority nationalities with unlimited praise for the new China's realization of a united and friendly national family. This high degree of internationalism and sincere friendship of the Korean Art Troupe towards the Chinese people will leave a very deep impression in the hearts of the Chinese people, thereby further deepening the great militant friendship between our two peoples.

    Let us learn well from the Korean comrades, learn from their valuable experience, to accelerate our socialist construction; and at the same time, further promote our proletarian internationalist spirit, further strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, and strengthen this strong fortress defending peace in the Far East and world peace.

    向朝鲜艺术团学习
    钱俊瑞
    勤劳、勇敢和富有才智的朝鲜人民，现在正跨上千里马，在建设社会主义的大道上飞跃前进。他们在经济和文化建设方面的巨大成就，受到中国人民热烈的欢呼和赞扬。兄弟般的朝鲜人民在各条战线上艰苦奋斗的精神都值得我们中国人民认真学习。他们在文化艺术方面的努力和成就当然也不例外。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国艺术团这次来到我国访问演出，是中朝两国文化交流和我国文化生活中的一件大事。他们优秀的演出，显然将使中朝两国人民以鲜血凝成的崇高友谊得到进一步的发展和巩固，同时又为中国的文艺工作者提供了很好的榜样。
    朝鲜艺术团演出最突出的一点，就是他们能够及时和有效地反映现实斗争和生活。他们的男声小合唱“士兵之歌”，舞蹈“在高地上相逢”，非常成功地刻划出人民战士的革命英雄主义和革命乐观主义，有力地表达了中朝两国人民的战斗友谊。女声小合唱“织布工之歌”和伽耶琴弹唱“纺车谣”，用十分优美的音节歌颂了纺织工人的劳动和生活。特别应该提出的，是令人欢欣鼓舞的舞蹈“铁水奔流”和“庆丰收”。前者是由一组矫健的男子舞蹈队，和另一组仙女般的女子舞蹈队美妙地组合起来，象征着一股铁水滚滚奔流和铁花飞溅的壮丽场景。后者是用轻快柔和的步调，表达朝鲜农民对多种农产高额丰收的欢庆心情。朝鲜艺术家们能够这样迅速和有效地反映工农业生产的跃进，从而推动生产的更大跃进，特别值得我国文艺工作者认真学习。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国艺术团的同志们娴熟地运用了民族形式表现人民的新生活，并且做到推陈出新。舞蹈“扇舞”给人们多么清新优美的感觉！伽耶琴的弹唱，轻歌清音，把人们引入一种恬静、纯洁和高尚的境界。
    朝鲜兄弟们用他们对于中国人民的深厚友情和热爱，像家人一般，亲切地演唱着中国的歌曲和舞蹈。他们怀着对美帝国主义同样的敌忾和对中国人民一定能够取得胜利的坚定信心，歌唱着“一定要把胜利的旗帜插到台湾”。他们如同和中国工农兄弟一起劳动、一起生活，欢唱着“三套黄牛一套马”和“二郎山”。他们又以对于新中国实现了团结友爱的民族大家庭的无限赞美的心情，表演了我国许多少数民族的民歌和舞蹈。朝鲜艺术团这种高度的国际主义精神和对中国人民的真挚友谊，将在我国人民心中留下十分深刻的印象，从而更加加深我们两国人民之间的伟大的战斗友谊。
    让我们好好地向朝鲜同志们学习，学习他们的宝贵经验，来加速我国的社会主义建设；同时更加发扬我们的无产阶级的国际主义精神，进一步加强中朝两国人民的友谊，加强这个保卫远东和平和世界和平的强大堡垒。
