    Taking the "Small Indigenous Groups" Path to Massively Produce Machinery and Equipment
    By Our Staff Commentator

    This spring, a massive agricultural tool reform movement unfolded in the vast countryside, followed by a national mass movement for vehicle transformation and the application of ball bearings. This was, in essence, a good start for the machine industry to embark on the path of "small indigenous groups." In recent months, the situation has seen new developments, with many regions further forming a mass movement to vigorously build indigenous machine tools and establish machinery manufacturing and repair plants, achieving significant results in just a few months.

    For example, the Fuyang area of Anhui Province was originally a region with inconvenient transportation and far from industrial centers. In 1957, the entire area had only five iron factories and some scattered iron cooperatives, with a total of only ninety-two dilapidated lathes. This year's great leap forward in agricultural production and the ball-bearing application movement, as well as the mass steelmaking movement, have placed new tasks on improving tools and manufacturing equipment, but mechanical equipment could not be bought. Therefore, the local Party committee put forward the slogan "Indigenous methods, self-reliance, self-made equipment," and set the goal of establishing a machinery manufacturing and repair network throughout the area in 1958, mobilizing the masses extensively. Within ten days of the movement's launch, the ten counties in the area manufactured more than five hundred pieces of various equipment. From May to October this year, the entire area manufactured more than one thousand five hundred indigenous machine tools and more than four thousand small iron-wood structure simple machine tools. Now, each commune in the area has an average of more than forty iron-wood structure machine tools, and a rural machinery repair network has been initially formed.

    Tianjin area of Hebei Province is another good example. The original level of mechanical industry in this area can be summarized by the twelve characters "weak foundation, low technology, poor conditions, and few equipment." The entire area had about three hundred dilapidated machine tools, scattered in thirty counties, most of which were four-foot and six-foot belt lathes. At the beginning of this year, the area sent a large number of cadres to run around the country to order equipment, but the results were minimal. Therefore, under the leadership of the local Party committee, they resolutely took the path of "small indigenous groups," mustered the enthusiasm of the masses, and started working, manufacturing four thousand one hundred indigenous machine tools in just three months, arming the one hundred and sixty-five iron factories and repair shops (stations) in the area, counties, and communes (townships).

    These two areas, starting from scratch and mobilizing the masses to vigorously develop the indigenous machine tool movement, have many common characteristics. First of all, in terms of leadership, the secretaries of Party committees at all levels took personal command. Secondly, the most basic point is that the masses were mobilized widely and deeply, even mobilizing street women and children. When the masses had concerns about manufacturing machine tools and were afraid of not being able to make them, they seized typical examples, organized large-scale debates, and adopted the method of "debating if not understood, looking if not believed, doing if understood, and debating again if not understood" to break the mysterious view of machine tool manufacturing. If there were no raw materials, they mobilized everyone to pick up scrap iron. For example, Tianjin area picked up more than one hundred thousand catties in one day. If there was not enough steel, they used wood instead. If there was no large gantry planer, they used stone mills to grind out the lathe bed. If there were no master craftsmen, they organized the "craftsmen" from the countryside, such as carpenters, soldering iron workers, and blacksmiths. They adopted the method of "sending out, inviting in" to solve the problem of technical guidance; they exchanged and disseminated technical experience through establishing typical examples, on-site meetings, and exhibitions and competitions. They ran short-term training classes to train technicians. Because the masses were mobilized deeply and thoroughly, enthusiastic slogans such as "seeing on the first day, touching on the second day, and producing results on the third day" appeared among the masses.

    Some people may doubt whether the indigenous machine tools made by indigenous methods, indigenous materials, and by indigenous technicians and peasants in the countryside can undertake machine manufacturing and repair tasks. This question is also answered affirmatively by the facts from the Fuyang and Tianjin areas. Fuyang area used these indigenous equipment to complete the production tasks of three hundred and thirty sets of eight-cubic-meter blast furnaces, one thousand blowers, and nearly five million sets of ball bearings, and manufactured one-and-a-half-ton cars, diesel engines, gas engines, electric motors, transformers and other power, transportation, and electrical equipment. Guanxiang Township in Dacheng County, Tianjin area, used its own indigenous machine tools to repair various power equipment totaling seventy horsepower that had not been repaired for many years. Wangchuangtuo Township in Wuqing County used its own indigenous machine tools to manufacture three 3.5-horsepower gas engines. Now, the entire area is advancing towards the goal of producing 100,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage power machinery and two thousand machine tools within the year.

    In the movement of vigorously developing indigenous equipment, there may be some phenomena of inefficient and inaccurate equipment. But this is, after all, only one finger out of ten. In the mass technical revolution movement, the quality of equipment will inevitably be rapidly improved. On the other hand, in terms of the objects served by machines, there are originally coarse and fine, high and low. The method of "using a sledgehammer to crack a nut," using precision equipment for coarse work and high-end equipment for low-end work, can only cause unnecessary waste to the country.

    In the process of the whole people running machinery, on the basis of the construction of thousands of small machinery manufacturing plants everywhere, there will inevitably be a situation of mass construction of various indigenous equipment, so that the "small indigenous groups" of the machinery industry will be integrated with the "small indigenous groups" of other economic sectors. On the other hand, because the mechanical equipment needed in many places can be manufactured and repaired locally, the unreasonable long-distance transportation of raw materials and finished products is fundamentally solved.

    The "small indigenous groups" movement in the machinery industry not only conforms to the general guideline of "more, faster, better, and more economical," and can accelerate the mechanization of agriculture and rural electrification in our country; but also, because a large number of indigenous equipment and small factories are designed by the masses, selected by the masses, manufactured by the masses, used by the masses, and managed by the masses, it can also rapidly popularize the knowledge of machinery manufacturing, cultivate a vast technical force, and create favorable conditions for accelerating the elimination of urban-rural differences and the differences between manual and mental labor.

    In order to launch the "small indigenous groups" movement of the machinery industry nationwide, the machinery manufacturing management departments at all levels must further conduct in-depth investigations and understand the development of the movement in various regions, grasp both ends and bring along the middle, and hold on-site meetings and skills competitions in separate areas to push the movement to a higher climax wave after wave; it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses and make them the masters of the machines; it is necessary to find ways to create more favorable conditions for the masses, such as organizing large factories to help small factories to train personnel, cooperate in production, and provide technical guidance, and select several points in different regions to centrally manufacture and supply key parts such as gears and lead screws that everyone generally finds difficult. The relevant machinery manufacturing scientific research institutions must quickly organize forces to go deep into various places to conduct investigations on the design, manufacture, and use of indigenous machines, summarize, analyze, and improve them, and collect and summarize the wisdom of the masses for exchange and promotion.

    Let us launch a movement to manufacture machinery and equipment using the "small indigenous groups" approach, let us hold high the banner of the machinery industry, and strive for a large-scale harvest in the machinery industry.

    走“小土群”的道路大造机器设备
    本报评论员
    今年春天，广大农村中展开了声势浩大的农具改革运动，随后又掀起了全国规模的车子化和滚珠轴承化的群众运动，这实质上已是机械工业走上“小土群”道路的良好开端。最近几个月来，形势又有了新的发展，许多地区已进一步形成了大搞土机床，大办机械制造及修理厂的群众运动，在三几个月里取得了显著的效果。
    例如，安徽省阜阳专区原来是一个交通不便、离工业中心较远的地区，1957年全区只有五个铁工厂和一些分散的铁业社，一共只有九十二台破旧车床。今年农业生产大跃进和轴承化运动以及全民炼钢的运动，对改良工具、制造设备提出了新的任务，但是机械设备买不到。于是地委就提出“土法上马，自力更生，自造设备”的号召，并提出在1958年内在全专区建立起机械制造修配网的奋斗目标，把群众广泛地动员起来。在运动开展后的十天内，全区十个县就制造五百多台各种设备。从今年5月到10月份的五个月期间，全专区一共制造了一千五百多台土机床和四千多台小型铁木结构的简易机床。现在全区平均每个公社已拥有铁木结构机床四十多部，农村中机械修配网已初步形成。
    河北省天津专区是另一个好的典型。这个区原有的机械工业水平，可以用“基础弱、技术低、条件差、设备少”十二个字来概括，全专区共有三百来台破旧机床，分散在三十个县里，绝大多数是四呎和六呎皮带车床。今年年初这个区曾派出大批干部跑遍全国订购设备，得来的结果却微乎其微。因而他们在地委的领导下，坚决走“小土群”的道路，鼓足群众的干劲，大家动手，在短短三个月内，制成了四千一百台土机床，把专区、县、社（乡）的一百六十五个铁工厂、修配厂（站）都武装了起来。
    这两个专区白手起家、发动群众大搞土机床运动，有许多共同的特点。首先，在领导上是各级党委书记亲自挂帅。其次，最基本的一条，是群众发动得广发动得深，连街道妇女和小孩都发动起来。当群众对制造机床有顾虑，怕作不出来的时候，他们就抓住典型，组织大争大辩，采取了“不通就辩，不信就看，通了就干，不通再辩”的办法，来打破对机床制造的神秘观点。没有原材料，他们就发动大家拣废铁。例如天津专区一天就拣了十几万斤。钢铁不够就用木料代替。没有大龙门刨床，就用石磨来磨出车床床面。没有老师傅，就把乡下的木匠、焊锡匠、打铁匠等“手艺人”组织起来。他们采用“派出去，请进来”的办法解决技术指导问题；通过树立典型、现场会议、展览评比等方式来交流传播技术经验。他们开办为期很短的训练班来训练技工。由于群众发动得又深又透，所以在群众中就出现了“头天看，二天摸，三天出成活”等豪迈的口号。
    有人可能会怀疑，用土办法、土材料由农村中的土技师和农民制造出来的土机床，究竟能不能承担机器制造和修配任务？这个问题同样从阜阳和天津两个专区的事实得到肯定的回答。阜阳专区用这些土设备完成了三百三十套八立方公尺的高炉，一千台鼓风机和将近五百万套滚珠轴承的生产任务，并且制成了一吨半小汽车和柴油机、煤气机、电动机、变压器等动力、交通运输和电力设备。天津专区大城县关乡用自己生产的土机床，修复了多年来无法修理的共七十马力的各种动力设备。武清县王床坨乡用自己生产的土机床制造出三点五马力的煤气机三台，现在全专区正向年内生产十万马力排灌动力机械和两千台机床的目标前进。
    在大搞土设备的运动中，可能出现某些设备效率不高、精度不够的现象。但这毕竟是十个指头中的一个指头，在群众性的技术革命运动中，设备的质量必然会迅速地得到提高。另一方面，就机器服务的对象来说，本来就有粗有精，有高有低。以精制粗，以高制低的“牛刀杀鸡”的办法，只能给国家造成不应有的浪费。
    在全民办机械的过程中，在成千上万的小型机械制造厂遍地兴建的基础上，必将出现群众性的大搞各种土设备的形势，从而使机械工业的“小土群”与其他经济部门的“小土群”结成一体。另一方面，由于许多地方上需要的机械设备可以就地制造和修配，就从根本上解决了原材料和成品不合理的远途运输的问题。
    机械工业的“小土群”运动，不但符合“多、快、好、省”的总方针，可以加速我国农业的机械化与农村电气化；而且由于大量的土设备和小工厂都是群众设计、群众选料、群众制造、群众使用、群众管理，因此还可以迅速地普及机械制造的知识，培养广大的技术力量，为加速消灭城乡差异以及体力劳动与脑力劳动的差异创造了有利的条件。
    为了使机械工业的“小土群”运动在全国范围内展开，各级机械制造管理部门必须进一步深入调查了解各地区运动发展的情况，抓两头带中间，分片召开现场会、比武会，把运动一浪接一浪，一浪高一浪地推向更高的高潮；必须把群众充分发动起来，使群众成为机器的主人；必须设法为群众创造更有利的条件，比如组织大厂帮助小厂进行培养人员、生产协作、技术指导，分地区选择若干个点，集中制造和供应大家普遍感到困难的齿轮、丝杠等关键零件。各有关的机械制造科学研究机关，必须迅速地组织力量深入各地，进行有关土机器的设计、制造、使用等方面的调查，加以总结、分析和提高，把群众的智慧收集汇总起来，进行交流与推广。
    让我们掀起一个用“小土群”的方针制造机器设备的运动，让我们把机械工业的帅旗高高举起，力争机械工业的大面积丰收。
