Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, November 27th: China's first 10,000-ton ocean-going freighter, built by Dalian Shipyard, was launched today. The Ministry of Communications has named this ocean-going freighter "Yuejin" (Leap Forward).

    At 10:00 AM, Dalian Shipyard held a grand launching ceremony. More than 20,000 people attending the launching ceremony stood on both sides of the giant ship. At 10:20 AM, the beautiful hull slid off the slipway and into the bay amidst military music, firecrackers, and cheers. At the launching ceremony meeting, representatives from the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Ministry of Communications, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Lüda Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Soviet experts warmly congratulated the completion of the hull of China's first 10,000-ton giant ship. Xie Zhongfeng, the representative of the Ministry of Communications, pointed out in his speech: The launching of China's first 10,000-ton ocean-going freighter marks a new leap in China's shipbuilding industry and a new stage in China's ocean shipping事业.

    This huge hull of the 10,000-ton giant ship designed by the Soviet Union was officially laid on the slipway and started construction before National Day this year. It only took fifty-eight days to complete and launch on November 27th. This speed is very fast. According to known materials: Britain, with more than 100 years of shipbuilding history, currently has a slipway cycle of six months for building 10,000-ton freighters; Japan, which currently has the world's leading shipbuilding speed, requires an average shortest slipway cycle of three months to build 10,000-ton freighters.

    This ocean-going freighter is equipped with the latest technology. It is 169.9 meters long, has a cargo capacity of 13,400 tons, and a displacement of 22,100 tons. It can break ice in frozen areas. The ship is equipped with a full set of mechanized and automated equipment, and its speed is extremely fast. Departing from Shanghai Port, it can directly reach major ports around the world without stopping to replenish fuel. The construction of this giant ship is the result of the rapid progress of China's metallurgy, power machinery, radio, and many other industries, as well as shipbuilding technology. Dalian Shipyard overcame the many difficulties in manufacturing by launching a mass movement, especially mobilizing the workers to engage in technical innovations. This factory built 4,500-ton tankers and 5,000-ton freighters last year and this year, and its shipbuilding technology has greatly improved. However, building a 10,000-ton ocean-going freighter is much more technically complex. Therefore, before construction began, some engineering and technical personnel believed that it would be good enough for China to be able to build a 10,000-ton freighter today, and that the shipbuilding speed could not compete with Britain and Japan. They suggested that it would take one year to build the hull of a 10,000-ton freighter. Another group of cadres and technical personnel proposed a "two-step" plan: using a slipway cycle of six months to build the first 10,000-ton freighter to catch up with Britain; and then using a slipway cycle of three months to catch up with Japan when building the second one. However, the factory Party committee boldly proposed the call to "Surpass Britain and catch up with Japan."

    To shorten the slipway cycle, a major revolution must be carried out in shipbuilding technology, discarding the old "tower" shipbuilding method and adopting the "three-island" fast shipbuilding method. The Party committee decided to implement this plan through a large-scale mass movement. The Party committee first adopted the method of giving bottom-line information, disclosing all the technical difficulties of the "three-island" fast shipbuilding method to the workers. Then, the workers launched a great debate, determined to create a world-class level in shipbuilding speed. They formed "technical revolution cooperatives" and "Zhuge Liang Associations" in succession, combining with technical personnel and working together to overcome all the technical difficulties. The successful experiment of this shipbuilding method provides rich experience for China's future rapid shipbuilding and increased ship production.

    After being launched, this giant ship will enter the stage of internal installation and fitting-out engineering. Finally, a sea trial will be conducted to withstand the rigorous test of waves and storms in the ocean before it can officially sail to the vast ocean. (Photo attached)

### 造船工业新飞跃  远洋航运新起点  第一艘万吨巨轮下水  大连造船厂举行隆重典礼，两万多人庆祝巨轮的船体建成

    造船工业新飞跃  远洋航运新起点
    第一艘万吨巨轮下水
    大连造船厂举行隆重典礼，两万多人庆祝巨轮的船体建成
    新华社旅大27日电　大连造船厂建造的我国第一艘万吨远洋货轮今天下水了。交通部将这艘远洋货轮命名为“跃进号”。
    上午十时，大连造船厂举行了隆重的下水典礼。前来参加下水典礼的两万多人，站在巨轮的两侧。十时二十分，漂亮的船体在军乐声、鞭炮声和万众欢腾声中滑下造船台，进入海湾。在下水典礼大会上，第一机械工业部、交通部、中共辽宁省委、中共旅大市委的代表与苏联专家代表，热烈祝贺我国第一艘万吨巨轮船体建成。交通部代表谢中峰在讲话中指出：我国第一艘万吨级远洋货轮下水，标志着我国造船工业新的飞跃，标志着我国的远洋航运事业迈进了一个新的阶段。
    这一艘由苏联设计的万吨巨轮的庞大船体，是在今年国庆节前夕正式铺上船台开工建造的，到11月27日建成下水只用了五十八天时间。这样的速度是很快的。据已知的材料：已有一百多年造船历史的英国，目前建造万吨级货轮的船台周期是六个月；目前造船速度居世界最前列的日本，建造万吨级货轮平均最短的船台周期也需要三个月。
    这艘远洋货轮是用最新的技术装备起来的。它全长一百六十九点九公尺，载货量达一万三千四百吨，排水量为二万二千一百吨，能在封冻的区域破冰航行。船上装备全套机械化、自动化的设备，航速极快，它从上海港出发，可以中途不靠岸补充燃料直接驶抵世界各主要港口。这艘巨轮的建造，是我国冶金、动力机械、无线电等许多工业和造船技术飞速进步的结晶。大连造船厂用大搞群众运动，特别是发动工人群众大闹技术革新的办法，冲破了制造中的重重困难。这个厂去年和今年曾建造过四千五百吨油轮和五千吨货轮，造船技术有很大提高，但是建造万吨级远洋货轮，技术却复杂得多，因此在开工以前，曾有个别工程技术人员认为中国今天能建造万吨级货轮就不错了，造船速度还无法和英国、日本较量，他们提出建造万吨级货轮的船体需要一年时间。另一部分干部和技术人员提出了一个“两步走”的方案：建造第一艘万吨级货轮用六个月的船台周期，赶上英国；建造第二艘时再用三个月的船台周期赶上日本，可是工厂党委却大胆提出了“超英国赶日本”的号召。
    缩短船台周期，必须在造船技术上来个大革命，抛弃旧的“塔式”造船法，采用“三岛式”快速造船法。党委决定通过大搞群众运动来实现这个计划。党委首先采取交底的办法，把“三岛式”快速造船法全部技术难题向工人交底，接着工人们掀起大鸣大放大辩论，决心在造船速度上闯出一个世界水平。他们纷纷组成“技术革命合作社”、“诸葛亮会”，和技术人员相结合，通力合作，全部攻克了技术难关。这个造船法的试验成功，为今后我国快速造船、提高船舶产量，提供了丰富经验。
    这艘巨轮下水后，将进入船体内部安装和舣装工程阶段。最后进行试航，在大洋里经得住波涛骇浪的严格考验，才能正式驶向辽阔的海洋。（附图片）
