    Mongolian People's Folk Art
    Lei Guiyuan
    After seeing the folk art exhibition of the Mongolian People's Republic, we all have an indescribable feeling stirring within us, feeling especially close. This is not only an artistic resonance, but also because the common language of political ideology connects the feelings of two great nations thousands of miles apart.
    We feel "familiar" with all the exhibits, as if a relative has come to our home. Indeed, our two peoples have always supported each other, sharing joys and sorrows, whether in the hard years of fighting against the reactionary ruling class, or in the joyous days of selflessly working to build socialism. Moreover, our two countries have been peace-loving nations since ancient times, and also nations that never succumb to humiliation, skilled at fighting against nature and even more skilled at fighting against enemies. This spirit of diligence, courage, and perseverance is bound to be reflected in art. Through outstanding means of beautifying life, these folk patterns shine brightly in the East, becoming a brilliant gemstone flower in the treasure house of world art.
    I think it is no exaggeration to describe the folk patterns of our two countries in this way. To say nothing else, just looking at the colors of folk patterns, the colors of our two countries' folk patterns, just like folk music singing, are good at choosing the most difficult to reconcile contrasting strong tones, using high wisdom to unify them, so that a pattern allows the audience to feel the pleasure of elegance and liveliness at any distance and any light, achieve a clear effect, and always be able to find fresh and pleasant feelings in it after any number of years. This is not only a technical success but a strong manifestation of the people's ardent desire for a happy life, freely creating life, unwilling to be slaves of nature, but to be masters of the world.
    The works displayed in the folk art exhibition of the Mongolian People's Republic, on the one hand, make people feel close, and on the other hand, make people feel fresh. Because although the folk patterns of China and Mongolia have their common points, they also have their own special styles, so it is felt that there are many things worth learning from us. Precisely because of this, we cherish this exhibition. And believe that it will further promote cultural exchanges between China and Mongolia.
    After seeing the exhibition, I felt as if I had listened to a Mongolian folk song and watched a Mongolian dance, not only with color but also with sound, and even saw diverse rhythms from all the pattern compositions. Every rhythm deeply touches the heart. Recalling it now, the lingering sound still lingers in the ears. I sincerely cheer for the victory of all the outstanding pattern designers of the Mongolian People's Republic.

    蒙古人民的民间艺术
    雷圭元
    我们看了蒙古人民共和国民间图案展览会之后，都有说不出来的一种感情在激荡，特别觉得亲切。这不仅是艺术上的共鸣，而且是因为政治思想上的共同语言把远隔千里的两个伟大民族的感情联系在一起了。
    我们对所有展品，都感到“似曾相识”，就好像是一位亲戚来到家中。确实，我们两国人民不论在对反动统治阶级进行斗争的艰苦岁月里，或是在忘我地劳动建设社会主义的欢腾的日子里，总是互相支援、苦乐相共的。不但如此，我们两国自古以来就是热爱和平的民族，也是永不屈辱的民族，既善于向自然斗争，更善于向敌人斗争的民族。这种勤劳勇敢、坚韧不拔的精神品质就必然反映到艺术上来。通过对于生活上美化的杰出的手段，在东方，这些民间图案放出了异彩，成为世界艺术宝库中一枝灿烂的宝石花。
    我想我这样来形容我们两国的民间图案，决非过甚其辞。不要说别的，单拿民间图案的色彩来看，我们两国民间图案的色彩，正像民间音乐歌唱一样，善于选择最不容易调和的对比的强音，用高度的智慧把它们统一起来，使一幅图案让观众在任何距离、任何光度之下，都能感受到优丽活泼的快感，达到明朗的效果，并且在任何年代之后，都经常能发现其中新鲜的愉快的感情。这不仅是技术上的成功而是人民热烈地要求生活幸福、自由地在创造着生活，不甘心做自然的奴隶，要做世界的主人的一种强烈的意志表现。
    蒙古人民共和国民间图案展览会中陈列的作品，一方面使人感到亲切，另方面也使人感到新鲜。因为中蒙两国的民间图案虽然有它的共同点，但是也有其各自特殊的风格，因此就感觉到有许多值得我们学习的地方。正因为这样，所以我们才珍视这个展览。并相信一定会进一步促进中蒙两国文化的交流。
    我看完展览会后，仿佛听了一次蒙古民歌，看了一次蒙古舞蹈，不但有色而且有声，更从所有的图案构成上看到多样的节奏，每一种节奏都深深扣人心弦，现在回忆起来，还是余音绕梁、不绝于耳。我诚挚地为蒙古人民共和国所有杰出的图案家的胜利而欢呼。
