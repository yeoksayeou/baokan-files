Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 4th: Japanese Communist Party Central Committee Chairman, Nozaka Sanzo, announced at a press conference today that the Japanese Communist Party demands the dissolution of the Diet and will fight to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet.

Nozaka strongly condemned the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's conspiracy to use violence to extend the session of the extraordinary Diet session and its attempt to intensify the suppression of the struggle of Japanese workers and people against the revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law."

Nozaka emphasized that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's conspiracy must not succeed. He said that the Japanese people have already understood that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's insane behavior can only lead the Japanese nation to destruction. Kishi Nobusuke's remarks to Brown, a reporter for NBC, confirmed this fact.

Nozaka pointed out that the current tension in Japan was created by the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, and it should bear full responsibility.

Nozaka resolutely stated that the Japanese Communist Party will do its utmost to fight to the end in order to realize the unanimous demand of eighty million Japanese people—immediate dissolution of the Diet and overthrow of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet. At the same time, the Japanese Communist Party will strive to establish a united front of democratic forces and organize joint actions. Nozaka emphasized that only in this way can the current chaos in Japan be resolved; at the same time, this is the only way to bring peace, true independence, democracy, and prosperity to Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 4th: The Japan Literary Artists Association today passed a statement at an extraordinary general meeting in Tokyo opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law." The statement pointed out that the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment" has the danger of threatening the freedom of speech, assembly, and citizens' lives, therefore, they strongly demanded that the Kishi government revoke this bill.

More than 140 members, including Association Chairman Aono Suekichi, attended today's extraordinary meeting. Japanese writers and critics such as Nakajima Kenzo, Takami Jun, Niwa Fumio, and Nakano Yoshio spoke at the meeting, demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government immediately revoke this reactionary bill.

Meeting Chairman Niwa Fumio announced that the Literary Artists Association solicited opinions on the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment" from more than 650 members, of which all but four expressed opposition to the bill, with the exception of four who said "unavoidable."

This afternoon, more than 500 people from various cultural organizations, including the Japan Literary Artists Association, the Performing Arts, Film and Broadcasting People's Roundtable, the National Culture Conference, the Cultural Figures Roundtable, and the Japan PEN Club, held a demonstration march on the streets of Tokyo against the revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law." This first demonstration by cultural figures held after the war, in which many famous scholars, actors, and writers participated, deeply moved the Japanese people.

    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会主席野坂参三今天在记者招待会上宣布，日本共产党要求解散国会，并且将为打倒岸信介内阁而奋斗。
    野坂强烈谴责岸信介内阁想用暴力来延长国会临时会议的会期，以及企图加紧镇压日本工人和人民反对修改“警察官职务执行法”的斗争的阴谋。
    野坂强调指出，岸信介内阁的这种阴谋决不能得逞。他说，日本人民已经懂得，岸信介内阁这种疯人般的做法只能把日本民族导向灭亡。岸信介对美国全国广播公司记者布朗发表的谈话就证实了这个事实。
    野坂指出，日本目前的紧张状态是由岸信介内阁制造出来的，它应该负完全责任。
    野坂坚决表示，日共为了实现八千万日本人民一致的要求——立即解散国会和打倒岸信介内阁，将尽力奋斗到底。同时，日共将努力建立民主力量的统一战线和组织共同行动。野坂强调说，这样才能收拾日本国内目前的混乱情况；同时，这也是给日本带来和平、真正独立、民主与繁荣的唯一途径。
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本文艺家协会今天在东京举行的临时全体会议通过了一项反对岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”的声明。声明指出，“警察官职务执行法修正案”有威胁言论、集会和市民生活的自由的危险，因此，他们强烈要求岸政府取消这项法案。
    协会会长青野季吉等一百四十多名会员出席了今天的临时会议。中岛健藏、高见顺、丹羽文雄、中野好夫等日本作家和评论家纷纷在会上发言，要求岸信介政府立即取消这项反动法案。
    会议主席丹羽文雄宣布，文艺家协会向六百五十多名会员征求他们对“警察官职务执行法修正案”的意见，其中除四人表示“不得已”以外，其他都表示反对这项法案。
    今天下午，属于日本文艺家协会、演剧电影广播人士恳谈会、国民文化会议、文化人恳谈会和日本笔会等各种文化团体的人士五百多人，在东京大街上举行了反对修改“警察官职务执行法”的示威游行。这次有许多著名学者、演员和作家参加的文化界人士在战后举行的第一次示威游行，使日本人民深受感动。
