Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 24th: The Guanshan Agricultural Cooperative, now the 301st Regiment of the Chenghai Commune in Chenghai County, Guangdong Province, which is famous for leveling land this spring, has created a new experience in comprehensively reorganizing cultivated land.

Their experience emerged under the new situation of agricultural production, based on the comprehensive leveling of land and the comprehensive survey and identification of soil this year. In order to adapt to the current development of production, the Party organization of the 301st Regiment proposed launching a winter farmland capital construction movement centered on deep plowing and soil improvement this winter and spring. Specific tasks include: first, deep plowing and soil improvement; second, continuing large-scale land leveling; third, continuing to build water conservancy projects to further improve the drainage and irrigation system and realize the division of labor in drainage and irrigation; and fourth, further realizing vehicle and boat transportation, and vigorously building bridges and roads. Through unified planning and comprehensive reorganization, the regiment fully embodies all measures, resolves contradictions between them, and enables the measures to interact with each other. First, 72 mu of harvested paddy fields were selected as the focus, and a professional company of 300 people was organized, divided into professional platoons and squads for deep plowing and soil improvement, winter planting, water conservancy construction, road construction, and fertilizer delivery, with division of labor and close cooperation, proceeding simultaneously. The appearance of this previously barren, shallow, and curved field hill has completely changed after five days and nights of hard work by the commune members. After deep plowing and stratified fertilization, the cultivated layer became deep, fertile, and soft, the roots of the crops grow deep, ensuring a bumper harvest of winter crops. Dividing the fields into plots for planting solves the mutual contradictions in management measures caused by different crop growth conditions. For example, broad beans need moisture from beginning to end, while peas do not need irrigation; separate and concentrated plots allow each crop to get what it needs, which is very beneficial to crop growth. The deepening of the cultivated layer provides room for crop roots to grow, creating conditions for intercropping; in addition, after the original curved ditches were straightened and deepened, cabbages were planted along the ditches, thus invisibly increasing the planting area by about 10% on the 52 mu of winter-planted land.

    适应当前生产需要
    澄海公社综合整理耕地
    据新华社广州24日电　广东省今春以平整耕地著名的澄海县冠山农业社、现在的澄海公社三○一团，又创造了综合整理耕地的经验。
    他们的这一经验，是在农业生产的新形势下，在今年全面大平整土地和全面勘查、鉴定土壤的基础上出现的。为了适应当前生产的发展，三○一团的党组织提出今冬明春开展一个以深翻改土为中心的冬季农田基本建设运动。具体工作一是深翻改土，二是继续进行土地大平整。三是继续兴修水利，进一步改善排灌系统，实现排灌分工。四是进一步实现车船化，大力修桥筑路。这个团通过统一规划，综合整理，把各项措施全面地体现出来，解决了相互间的矛盾，使各项措施互为作用。首先选择已经收割的七十二亩稻田作为重点，组织了三百人的专业连，分成深翻改土、冬种、修水利、修道路、送肥等专业排、班，分工合作，紧密配合，同时并进。这片原来贫瘠、浅薄、弯曲的田丘，经过社员五昼夜的奋战，面貌完全改变。经过深翻和分层施肥，耕作层达到深、肥、软，作物的根群长得深，可保证冬种作物特大丰收。分片划分田丘种植，解决了因作物生长条件不同所引起的管理措施的互相矛盾。例如蚕豆自始至终需要湿润，豌豆却不需要灌溉，分片集中，各得其所，对作物生长非常有利。耕作层加深，作物根群有生长余地，给间种提供了条件；加上原来弯曲的水沟改直加深后，沟边种了包菜，这样在五十二亩冬种地上无形中就增加了约一成的种植面积。
