Balanced Work and Rest, Increased Work Efficiency
    Xindeng Commune's Shimen Brigade Achieves High Quality and Early Completion of Autumn Harvest and Winter Planting

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Shimen Brigade of Xindeng People's Commune in Zhejiang Province has made proper arrangements for the production and life of its members, ensuring that work is done in spurts, with regular rest periods. As a result, the members are more motivated and their work efficiency is higher.

    The Shimen Brigade is located at the foot of Tianmu Mountain. Its fields, land, and mountains all yield produce, and it also has industries such as charcoal burning and papermaking. During the Great Leap Forward, the brigade's more than two thousand laborers unleashed their soaring enthusiasm and worked selflessly, leading to rapid progress in production. In grain production alone, this year they completely reversed the past situation of relying on supplies from other areas. They have achieved free meals in the public canteens, with everyone eating their fill; enough seeds have been retained for next year; and over 700,000 catties of grain have been handed over to the state throughout the year. During the nationwide campaign to produce steel, in addition to building furnaces to smelt iron, they also built charcoal kilns throughout the thirty-mile-long mountains to burn charcoal in support of steel production. These outstanding achievements have further encouraged the members' enthusiasm for production, and they have plunged into intensive harvesting and planting, as well as a variety of winter production activities.

    At this time, the General Party Branch of the Shimen Brigade, in order to cherish the socialist enthusiasm of the masses and better arrange their lives, decided to prioritize their well-being. The brigade adopted the following measures: First, it stipulated production and rest times. During the busy farming season, sleep should not be less than eight hours per night, production should be twelve hours, and there should be half an hour of rest after breakfast and lunch, as well as forty-five minutes of rest during production each day. Second, the brigade organically combined concentrated work periods with rest and recuperation, seizing the time for concentrated efforts and providing timely rest afterward. For example, after ten days of intense harvesting and planting, the work was basically completed. At this time, the entire brigade celebrated Patriotism Day, summarizing the autumn harvest and winter planting work, rewarding the two hundred and sixty-one outstanding producers who emerged during this stage, and planning the work for the next stage. According to the brigade's regulations, this type of Patriotism Day is held twice a month: once for the entire brigade and once by each team, choosing the date based on their production situation. Third, it stipulated monthly rest days. Fourth, it improved living conditions and improved the canteens. Members can eat two dishes at each meal, with hot food and hot dishes every time. The canteen slaughters pigs twice a month, and sometimes provides evening meals as needed. The cooks deliver water and food to the fields and mountains, which greatly satisfies the members. The staff of the brigade's twenty-four nurseries also promptly deliver the nursing infants to their mothers who are working, reducing the mothers' travel fatigue. Fifth, the brigade vigorously carries out recreational activities, while also conducting field recreational activities.

    At the same time, the brigade mobilized its members to create new tools with greater enthusiasm, improve work efficiency, and ensure that tasks are completed on time, in quantity, and with quality. In addition, it strengthened the planning of production, with specific production plans for each production stage and each day; vigorously carried out tool reforms, promoting overhead cable transport, rapid harvesters, etc.; and organized the combination of various farm jobs to reduce and avoid the waste of labor.

    In this way, with a balance of work and rest, the members' enthusiasm has become increasingly high, and efficiency has significantly improved. This year's autumn harvest and winter planting were completed about half a month earlier than last year, and the quality is also very good, with most of the land being deeply plowed to about one foot, and more than twice as much fertilizer accumulated as in the same period last year. In various production activities, many new things have emerged, displaying high work efficiency and communist moral qualities. Member Yu Chunlei planted fifty-two catties of broad bean seeds in one day, with two seeds in each hole, all planted well. Female members Qiu Jinxian and Zhang Guihua reaped more than eight mu of rice in one day, and female member Dai Baihua threshed all eight mu of rice in one day. In the past, each person could only reap about one mu of rice per day.

    劳逸有节　工效提高
    新登公社石门大队秋收冬种质量好结束早
    本报讯　浙江省新登人民公社石门大队妥善安排社员的生产和生活，使突击分段，休息有时，因而社员们干劲更足，工效更高。
    石门大队在天目山麓，田里、地里、山上都有产品，又有烧木炭、造纸等工业。在大跃进中，这个大队两千多个劳动力发挥了冲天干劲，忘我劳动，生产上突飞猛进。仅粮食生产一项，今年就彻底扭转了过去一贯依靠其他地区供应的状况，做到了公共食堂吃饭不要钱，人人放开肚皮吃饱饭；明年的种子也留足了，而且全年上交粮食七十多万斤。在全民大办钢铁中，这里除建炉炼铁外，还在三十里大山中遍建木炭窑，烧木炭支援钢铁生产。这些出色的成绩，更加鼓舞了社员们的生产干劲，投入紧张的抢收抢种和多种多样的冬季生产。
    在这时候，中共石门大队总支为了珍惜群众社会主义热情更好地安排生活，决定把生活抓起来。全大队采取了如下措施：第一，规定生产和休息时间。农忙期间，晚上睡眠不少于八小时、生产十二小时，在早饭和中饭以后又各休息半小时，生产中每天还有四十五分钟的休息时间。第二，突击与休整有机结合，抓住时间进行突击，突击后及时休整。例如秋收冬种紧张地突击了十天，这个工作基本结束。这时，全大队过爱国日，总结了秋收冬种工作，奖励了这一阶段中出现的二百六十一个优秀生产者，并安排下一阶段的工作。按大队规定，这种爱国日每月二次：一次全大队举行，一次由各个小队按生产情况自行选择日期举行。第三，规定每月的休息日。第四，搞好生活，搞好食堂。社员们每餐能吃到两个菜，餐餐热饭热菜。食堂每月杀猪两次，有时根据需要供应夜餐，炊事员们送水送饭到田间山上，社员们极为满意。全大队二十四所托儿所的工作人员，也及时把喂奶的小孩送到他们正在生产的母亲旁边，减少母亲往返劳累。第五，大搞文娱活动，同时开展田间文娱活动。
    与此同时，大队发动社员们以更大干劲创造新的工具，提高工作效率，保证及时按质按量完成任务。同时，加强了生产的计划性，每个生产阶段、每天都有具体生产计划；大搞工具改革，推行天线运输、快速收割机等；又组织各种农活的结合，减少和避免劳动力的浪费。
    这样，有劳有逸，社员们劲头越来越足，效率显著提高。今年的秋收冬种的完成要比去年提早半月左右，质量也很好，绝大部分深耕一尺左右，积肥也比去年同期多了一倍多。在各种各样的生产活动中，出现了许多显示高工效和共产主义道德品质的新事物。社员喻春雷在一天内播种了五十二斤蚕豆种子，每孔两颗，孔孔种得好。女社员裘金娴、章桂花两人一天割稻八亩多，女社员戴百花一天就把这八亩多稻子全部打下来，而在过去，每人每天只能割稻一亩左右。
