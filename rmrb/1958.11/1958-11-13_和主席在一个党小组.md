　　In March 1944, I worked at the Yan'an Wood Factory.

　　Chairman Mao’s cook, Master Lin, got sick and had to go to the hospital. The administrator looked everywhere for someone, but couldn’t find a suitable person. As soon as I heard this news, I volunteered to take on the job of cook.

　　As soon as I got to my job, Chairman Mao started chatting with me, asking my name, where I was from, when I joined the revolution... very warmly, like parents telling stories to their children. From then on, Chairman Mao always called me "Little He" with a smile.

　　I am a Communist Party member. Our party group included comrades Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Ke Qingshi, Li Fuchun, and others. At the first party group meeting, Chairman Mao suggested that I be elected as the group leader, and other comrades agreed. I felt embarrassed and declined repeatedly. Chairman Mao said, "The organizational principle of the Party is that the minority submits to the majority. Since everyone agrees that you should be the group leader, then give it a try. If you encounter difficulties, everyone will find a way to solve them." From this group meeting, I became the party group leader.

　　"Little He," Chairman Mao called me to his office one day and said, "Group leader, I haven't reported yet..."

　　"You are the Chairman, so you don't need to report," I said cautiously.

　　"No, there is no high or low in the Party, we are all Party members. You are the group leader, which means you are my leader," Chairman Mao said very seriously. It was the first time I had seen him so serious.

　　I was speechless. After a moment, Chairman Mao continued:

　　"In the future, if I forget to report, you come to me and criticize me."

　　Hearing Chairman Mao's words, I felt a warmth in my heart. Even today, it is still fresh in my memory, vividly present in my mind.

　　Time flew, and it was June in the blink of an eye. Master Lin recovered and was discharged from the hospital, returning to Chairman Mao's side. I also had to return to my original job. Before parting, Chairman Mao had a conversation with me.

　　"Little He, you have worked very well these past two months, you have worked really hard."

　　"No, Chairman, there are still many shortcomings in my work..."

　　"In these two months, do you have any opinions? Be bold and offer them, don't worry about being polite!" Chairman Mao asked for opinions with a smile and great sincerity.

　　I paused, and said hesitatingly, "No, I just don't want to leave Chairman."

　　"Little He, we must look at problems from a comprehensive perspective!" Chairman Mao paused slightly and then continued, "We will soon launch a counter-offensive, and the Japanese devils will be finished. You can fight battles, and you can also run factories. The troops need you, and the factories also need you. If you were to cook for me for a long time, it would be a waste of our talent... Go, go to the job where you are needed."

　　Hearing Chairman Mao's words, the dissatisfaction in my heart immediately vanished. I happily packed my bags, saluted Chairman Mao, and returned to the wood factory.

    和主席在一个党小组
    何德全
    1944年3月，我在延安木工厂工作。
    毛主席的炊事员林师傅得了病，要去住医院，管理员四处找人，就是找不到合适的人。我一听到这消息，就自报奋勇去担任了炊事员工作。
    我一到工作岗位，毛主席就给我摆起家常来，问我叫啥名字，那里的人，多会参加革命的……非常亲热，就像父母给孩子们讲故事一样。从那时候起，主席总是笑眯眯地叫我“小何”。
    我是共产党员。我们那个党小组里有毛泽东、刘少奇、朱德、柯庆施、李富春等同志。开第一次党小组会，主席提议选我当组长，其他同志都表示赞成。我怪不好意思的，再三推让。主席说：“党的组织原则是少数服从多数。大家都同意你当组长，你就试试看吧。遇到困难大家想办法解决。”从这次小组会，我就当了党的小组长。
    “小何，”主席有一天把我喊到他的办公室说：“小组长，我还没有汇报呢……”
    “你是主席，就不汇报了吧。”我很拘束地说。
    “不，党内没有高低之分，都是党员。你是小组长，就是我的领导。”主席很严肃，像这样的认真我还是第一次看到呢。
    我无言对答，停了片刻，主席又说：
    “今后如果我忘了汇报，你就找我，批评我。”
    听了主席的话，心里觉得甜丝丝的。直到今天还记忆犹新，活现在我脑海里。
      转眼到了6月。林师傅病好出院了，又回到毛主席的身旁。我也要回到原来的工作岗位。临别时，主席给我谈了一次话。
    “小何，两个多月来，你工作得很好，实在辛苦了。”
    “不，主席，我工作中还有不少缺点……”
    “在这两个多月里，你有什么意见吗？要大胆地提，打破情面哪！”主席微笑着，很虚心地征求意见。
    我停了停，吞吞吐吐地说：“没有，就是不愿意离开主席。”
    “小何，看问题要从全面出发呀！”主席稍停后又继续说：“我们很快就要反攻了，小日本就要完蛋了。你能打仗，也会办工厂，部队需要你，工厂也需要你。如果你要长期给我做饭，就浪费了我们的人材……去吧，还是到需要的工作岗位上去吧。”
    听了主席这一席话，满肚子的不愉快顿时烟消云散，我高高兴兴地打起背包，给主席敬了个礼，又回到了木工厂。
