    A Woman Teacher Borrows a Cart
    A female comrade rushed into the gate of our school and said to the administrator, "Comrade, could you please lend us your handcart for hauling vegetables?" The administrator said with some difficulty, "We need the cart ourselves, we can't lend it."
      "We only need it for one trip, to haul yellow earth, just for an hour." "Once the cart is out, who knows when it will be back?" Indeed, the cart had gone out to haul coal, but from his tone, it was clear that the administrator wasn't keen on lending it – it was a brand new cart!
    "It's almost lunchtime, the cart should be back soon, I've already inquired and know that the cart will be idle for an hour after lunch. If you don't lend it, I won't leave. Our students said that if you don't lend it, we'll赖 (lai - act shamelessly). If we meet Uncle Liberation Army soldiers, we'll 赖 even more fiercely." Saying this, she sat down opposite the administrator.
    This female comrade is our neighbor, a teacher at the elementary school. The school wants to build two earthen blast furnaces to smelt iron, and they need to transport ore, fuel, etc., but they lack transportation. So they've mobilized many people, running all over half the city, borrowing carts everywhere. They are especially busy in the afternoon and at night. She and many students have already stayed up for two nights, and tomorrow they will produce their first batch of iron.
    At this moment, the lunch bell rang. The cart also returned. As soon as the woman teacher saw the cart, she stood up quickly, her eyes fixed on the administrator. The administrator lowered his head and said, "Alright! Write a borrowing slip, but don't damage the cart."
    The woman teacher agreed and happily pushed the cart out. The administrator hesitated for a moment, then ran out after her, calling out, "I'll go with you, and push a load too!"

    女教员借车
    一位女同志闯进了我们学校的大门，冲着管理员说，“同志，请你把你们拉菜的手推车借给我们好不好？”管理员为难地说：“车子我们自己要用，不能借。”
      “我们只用一趟，拉黄土，只要一小时。”“车子出去了，还不知道什么时候回来呢？”的确，车子出去拉煤了，可是从口气里可以听得出，管理员不大想借，那是一辆崭新的车子呀！
    “要吃午饭了，车子就要回来了，我早已打听清楚，午饭后，车子要闲一个钟头。不借，我不走。我们的学生说，不借我们会赖。碰到解放军叔叔，我们赖得更凶。”说着，她在管理员的对面坐了下来。
    这位女同志是我们的近邻，小学里的老师。学校里要砌两个土高炉炼铁，运矿砂、燃料等等，缺乏运输工具，她们就出动了许多人，跑遍了半个城，到处借车子。午后、夜里，她们就格外忙碌了。她和许多学生已经熬了两个通宵，明天就要出第一炉铁了。
    这时候，午饭号响了。车子也回来了。女教师一见车子，连忙站起来，两眼直瞧着管理员，管理员低着头说：“好吧！打个借条，可不要把车子碰坏了。”
    女教师一面答应，一面高高兴兴地推着车子往外走。管理员犹豫了一下，就跟着跑出去，叫道：“我跟你们去，也推一趟！”
