    Using Despicable Means to Push Forward Reactionary Policies
    Japan's Liberal Democratic Party Forcibly Extends Diet Session
    (Dispatch from our correspondent in Tokyo) On November 4th, the Japanese government of Nobusuke Kishi and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, harboring ulterior motives, used extremely crude methods violating Diet procedure to forcibly pass a resolution in the House of Representatives plenary session to extend the extraordinary Diet session by thirty days (until December 7th), staging a shameful farce.
    The current extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet was scheduled to end on November 7th. The Nobusuke Kishi government originally intended to pass reactionary bills such as the amendment to the "Police Duties Execution Law" during this session, but this attempt failed due to the strong opposition of the Japanese people. Therefore, the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party attempted to forcibly extend the extraordinary Diet session in order to pass these reactionary bills.
    After the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet meeting decided on the policy of extending the session at around 9:00 AM on the 4th, Chief Cabinet Secretary Akagi and Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Matsumoto met with House of Representatives Speaker Hoshijima of the Liberal Democratic Party at 3:05 PM and proposed extending the extraordinary Diet session. At 4:48 PM, a large group of Liberal Democratic Party members, surrounding House of Representatives Vice-Speaker Shiikuma Saburo, suddenly rushed into the House of Representatives hall and convened a meeting. Without even sitting down, the Vice-Speaker hastily grabbed the microphone arranged for speakers from the Liberal Democratic Party seats and announced the meeting, also announcing the decision to extend the extraordinary Diet session by thirty days, asking everyone to vote. The entire hall immediately erupted in an uproar. Ruling party and opposition party members pushed and shoved each other, and the hall was thrown into chaos, with members standing up. Some members stood up to express their opposition, but amidst the chaos, Shiikuma announced that those standing had exceeded half the total, and the decision was "unanimously passed," and then adjourned the meeting. From the announcement of the meeting to the adjournment, it took only three or four minutes. Moreover, it was later discovered that there were no minutes of the meeting.
    The farce staged by Nobusuke Kishi during the extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet has aroused immense indignation among Japanese public opinion. The Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the same day, severely condemning the illegal activities of the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party in unilaterally extending the Diet session. The Japan Socialist Party also issued a statement, stating that the Nobusuke Kishi government's approach was a "violent act akin to a coup d'état, disregarding Diet conventions and relevant laws," and stated that it would completely not recognize Diet meetings after November 8th and would resolutely fight with all its strength to smash the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment." The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan also clearly stated that the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party's forced passage of the extension of the Diet session was illegal. The All Japan Trade Union Conference and the "National Conference Against Revision of the Police Duties Execution Law" stated that they would strengthen the struggle against the Nobusuke Kishi government's reactionary policies.
    Kazuo Ogawa of NHK revealed in "The Press Says" that the Nobusuke Kishi government's extension of the Diet session for such a long time clearly meant that it was determined to pass the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" during this extraordinary Diet session. When Mainichi Broadcasting reported on this farce, it believed that the Nobusuke Kishi government's approach would only strengthen the opposition of Japanese public opinion. Yoshitake, a commentator for the "Asahi Shimbun," said: This was a carefully planned action by the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party. What kind of parliamentary politics is this if such despicable means are used to throw the Diet into chaos?!
    House of Representatives Speaker Hoshijima and Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi did not attend this parliamentary session. It is said that Hoshijima was being held under house arrest by the Liberal Democratic Party, while Nobusuke Kishi slipped away before the meeting under some pretext.

### 用卑鄙手段推行反动政策  日本自由民主党强行延长国会会期

    用卑鄙手段推行反动政策
    日本自由民主党强行延长国会会期
    本报讯　东京消息：11月4日，日本岸信介政府和执政的自由民主党，怀着不可告人的目的，以违反国会议事程序的极端粗暴的手段，在众议院全体会议上，强行通过把国会临时会议延长三十天（到12月7日止）的决议，演出了一场可耻的丑剧。
    日本的这一次国会临时会议，应当在11月7日结束。岸信介政府原打算在这次会期中通过修改“警察官职务执行法”等反动法案，但是由于日本人民的强烈反对，这个企图没有能够实现。于是岸信介政府和自由民主党就想强制延长国会临时会议期限，以便通过这些反动法案。
    4日晨九时许岸信介内阁会议确定了延长会期的方针后，午后三时零五分内阁官房长官赤城和副长官松本，会见自由民主党的众议院议长星岛，提出了延长国会临时会议期限的要求。到下午四时四十八分，一大群自由民主党议员就拥着众议院副议长椎熊三郎，突然闯进了众院会场，召集开会。这个副议长连坐也不坐一下，就急急忙忙抓起场内自由民主党席位上的安排发言的麦克风宣布开会，并且宣布了延长国会临时会议三十天的决定，要大家表决。全场登时哗然，执政党和在野党的议员一时你推我撞，扭作一团，会场陷于混乱状态，议员们都站起来了。这些议员有的是表示反对才站起来的，可是椎熊在一片混乱之中竟宣布说全场起立者已超过半数，决定已“一致通过”，宣布休会。从宣布开会到宣布休会，也不过三几分钟的样子。而且事后发现连会议的纪录也没有了。
    岸信介在日本国会临时会议搞的这场闹剧，引起了日本公众舆论的无比愤慨。日本共产党于当天发表声明，严厉谴责岸信介政府和自由民主党片面延长国会会期的非法活动。日本社会党也发表声明，认为岸信介政府这种作法是“不顾国会惯例和有关法令的形同政变的粗暴行为”，并且表示完全不承认11月8日以后的国会会议，坚决以全力为粉碎“警察官职务执行法修正案”而斗争。日本工会总评议会也明确表示，岸信介政府和自由民主党强行通过延长国会会期是非法的。全日本工会会议和“反对修改警察官职务执行法国民会议”，表示要加强反对岸信介政府反动政策的斗争。
    日本广播协会的小川和夫在“新闻界说”中揭露说：岸信介政府把国会会期延长这么久，显然是一定要在这次国会临时会议上通过“警察官职务执行法修正案”。每日广播电台在报道这幕丑剧时，认为岸信介政府的这种作法只会加强日本舆论界的反对。“朝日新闻”吉武论说委员说：这是岸信介政府和自由民主党经过周密策划的行动，采取这种卑劣的手段把国会弄得乌烟瘴气，那还成了什么议会政治呢？！
    日本众议院议长星岛和日本首相岸信介都没有出席这次议会会议。据说星岛是被自由民主党软禁起来了，而岸信介则借故在开会前溜走了。
