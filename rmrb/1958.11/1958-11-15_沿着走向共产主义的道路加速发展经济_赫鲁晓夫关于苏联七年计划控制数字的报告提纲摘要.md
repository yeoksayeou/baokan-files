Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 14th (TASS): The report outline made by Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, titled "Control Figures for the Development of the Soviet National Economy from 1959 to 1965," has been published here to allow the entire nation to conduct broad discussions on this plan before the convening of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

The report outline points out that the Soviet people have realized extremely significant reforms, making it possible for the Soviet Union to enter a new and most important period of development—the period of carrying out the construction of a communist society. The main task of this period will be to comprehensively establish the material and technical foundation of communism, further strengthen the Soviet Union's economic and defense capabilities, and at the same time, to more fully satisfy the material and spiritual needs of the Soviet people.

This will be a decisive stage in the contest with the capitalist world, in which a historical task will be practically completed—catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in terms of total output value calculated per capita.

The outline states that the control figures for the development of the national economy from 1959 to 1965 are an integral part of the long-term plan for the next fifteen years. This long-term plan is the Soviet Union's economic program for building communism.

The outline points out that in the next fifteen years, the Soviet Union will rank first in the world not only in terms of total output value, but also in terms of output value calculated per capita.

The prospect of developing the Soviet national economy in the next fifteen years stipulates that during this period, industrial sectors of decisive significance will increase their products by one to two times. There will be further huge upsurges in all agricultural sectors.

The fundamental issue for the recent seven years (1959-1965) is the issue of accelerating the development of the national economy along the road to communism, and maximizing the time gained in the peaceful economic competition between socialism and capitalism.

Glorious Achievements of Soviet Construction

The outline also discusses the glorious achievements made by the Soviet Union in economic and cultural construction since the establishment of the Soviet regime. The outline points out that since the establishment of the Soviet regime, the Soviet Union's national income calculated per capita has increased fourteenfold. The growth of national income reflects the overall upsurge of the national economy and the improvement of the people's living standards. The outline emphasizes that in the forty-one years of the Soviet regime's existence, the Soviet people have only been able to engage in peaceful labor for a little more than half of the time, because the periods of war and post-war recovery of the damaged economy occupied almost twenty years.

For example, the magnificent scale of industrial production can be seen from the following: In 1958, the Soviet Union's steel output will reach about 55 million tons, and oil extraction will reach 113 million tons, which means that the current monthly output of steel and oil extraction is more than the entire annual output in 1913. In 1958, electricity generation will reach 233 billion kilowatt-hours. The current electricity generation in the Soviet Union every three days is equal to the entire year's electricity generation in Tsarist Russia. In the old Russian era, there was virtually no chemical industry, but currently, the output value of the Soviet chemical industry ranks second in the world.

The outline emphasizes that in 1958, the Soviet Union surpassed countries such as Britain, West Germany, and France in terms of the absolute production level of pig iron, steel, coal, electricity, cement, timber, sawn timber, and cotton fabrics. The distance between the Soviet Union and the United States in terms of the production of ferrous metals, the mining of iron ore and coal, and the production of many machines and instruments has been greatly shortened. In recent years, the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States not only in terms of growth rate, but also in terms of the annual absolute increase in many products, such as iron ore, pig iron, steel, oil, coal, cement, etc.

The outline emphasizes that due to the achievements made by countries that have embarked on the road of socialist development in recent times, the socialist world system is increasingly fully demonstrating its indisputable superiority over the capitalist system.

According to preliminary statistics, the industrial output value of socialist countries in 1958 will increase by 3.9 times compared to the output value in 1937. If we consider that in 1937 there was only the Soviet Union as the only socialist country, then the industrial output value of the socialist economic system increased by 8.5 times from 1937 to 1958. In the same period, the industrial output value of capitalist countries increased by less than one time, and recently, the output value of capitalist countries (the United States and some other countries) has been continuously decreasing.

Main Tasks of the Seven-Year Plan

The outline states that the main tasks of the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy from 1959 to 1965 are to further vigorously develop all economic sectors on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, and to vigorously strengthen the country's economic potential, so as to ensure the continuous improvement of the people's living standards.

The outline states that the characteristics of the Soviet Union's development in the next seven years are: the further upsurge of socialist culture, the further growth of the spiritual wealth of Soviet society, and the further improvement of the level of consciousness of the working people, who are active builders of communism.

The outline states that the starting point of the national economic development perspective plan is: it is necessary to win time in the peaceful economic competition with the most developed capitalist countries, and to develop the economy, especially production sectors of decisive significance, at the fastest speed.

The control figures for 1959-1965 stipulate: to develop the national economy at a high speed, while carrying out the necessary balance; to greatly increase the output of ferrous metals and non-ferrous metals; to accelerate the development of the chemical industry; to change the structure of fuel production by prioritizing the development of oil and gas extraction and production; to rapidly develop the electrification of all national economic sectors mainly by building large-scale thermal power plants; to carry out the technical transformation of railway transportation on the basis of electrification and widespread use of internal combustion locomotives; to further develop all agricultural sectors; and to rapidly develop residential construction.

The outline states that this Seven-Year Plan pays special attention to further developing the rich resources of the eastern regions of the Soviet Union. To this end, it stipulates: to build a powerful third metallurgical base in Siberia and Kazakhstan; to vigorously develop non-ferrous metallurgy in Kazakhstan, Central Asia, the Urals, and areas east of Lake Baikal; to develop the power industry in Siberia using cheap coal; to rapidly develop the oil and gas industry in the area between the Volga River and the Urals and the gas industry in Uzbekistan; and to accelerate the development of the chemical industry in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union.

At the same time, all possibilities will be used to accelerate the development of the productive forces in the European part of the country.

The outline points out that the characteristics of this Seven-Year Plan will be: technological progress in all sectors of the national economy, and in particular, the scope of peaceful use of atomic energy will continue to expand.

The outline states that the main direction of the Seven-Year Plan for the development of the Soviet national economy is peaceful economic development and improvement of the people's welfare, and the completion of this plan will also further strengthen the Soviet Union's defense capabilities, making it more fully prepared to defend the achievements of socialism from any conspiracy by imperialist aggressors.

Industrial Development

The outline points out that in 1965, the Soviet Union's total industrial output value will increase by about 80% compared to 1958, of which the production of means of production will increase by 85% to 88%, and the production of consumer goods will increase by 62% to 65%. The average annual increase in industrial output value in the seven years is about 135 billion rubles, while it was 90 billion rubles in the past seven years.

The control figure plan stipulates accelerating the development of the ferrous metallurgical industry, especially its iron ore base.

In 1965, the output of pig iron will reach 65 million to 70 million tons, which is an increase of 65% to 77% compared to 1958. Steel production will reach 86 million to 91 million tons, an increase of 56% to 65%, and steel products will be 65 million to 70 million tons, an increase of 52% to 64%. In order to ensure the iron ore needed for the development of the ferrous metallurgical industry, it is planned to develop new iron mines, mainly open-pit mining, and to build a number of large-scale ore dressing complexes. It is planned to mine 150 million to 160 million tons of commercial iron ore (230 million to 245 million tons of raw iron ore).

The new production capacity to be built and put into production in 1959-1965 is: ironmaking capacity of 24 million to 30 million tons, steelmaking capacity of 28 million to 36 million tons, and rolling capacity of 23 million to 29 million tons.

In terms of developing the non-ferrous metallurgical industry, it is stipulated that aluminum production should increase by about 1.8 times compared to 1958, refined copper should increase by 90%, and the production of nickel, magnesium, titanium, germanium, silicon, and other non-ferrous metals, especially rare metals, should also be greatly increased.

It is stipulated to establish a powerful aluminum industry in the Krasnoyarsk Territory of Siberia, which has abundant nepheline syenite reserves and can conveniently obtain cheap cement and various soda products.

In 1965, the Soviet Union's diamond production will increase by about 13 times compared to 1958.

The control figures for 1959-1965 stipulate accelerating the development of the chemical industry, and the total output value of the chemical industry should increase by about two times. The large-scale production of new synthetic materials (for example, synthetic fibers should increase by 11 to 13 times) makes it possible to drastically expand the production of inexpensive and high-quality consumer goods.

The amount of mineral fertilizer will double in seven years. More than 140 large-scale chemical enterprises will be newly built and more than 130 enterprises will be renovated in the seven years.

In terms of the fuel industry, the proportion of oil and gas in the total fuel production will increase from the current 31% to 51% in 1965, while the proportion of coal will decrease from 59% to 43%.

It is planned to extract 230 million to 240 million tons of oil in 1965, which is more than double the amount in 1958. It is stipulated that the extraction and production of gas should increase to 150 billion cubic meters in 1965, while it was 30 billion cubic meters in 1958. About 26,000 kilometers of main gas pipelines and branch pipelines to cities will be built in seven years.

The outline states that the next seven years are the decisive stage for realizing Lenin's idea of complete electrification of the Soviet Union.

Electricity production will increase to 500 billion to 520 billion kilowatt-hours in 1965, which is an increase of one to 1.2 times compared to 1958. The designed power generation capacity of each power station will more than double.

Prioritizing the construction of thermal power plants makes it possible to increase the total power generation capacity of the country's power stations by about 10 million kilowatts in seven years by reducing investment in hydropower construction.

In addition to putting powerful thermal power plants into production, it is also stipulated to complete the construction of the Stalingrad Hydropower Station, the Bratsk Hydropower Station, the Kremenchug Hydropower Station, the Votkinsk Hydropower Station, the Bukhtarma Hydropower Station, and other hydropower stations.

During the seven years, a unified power system will be established in the European part of the Soviet Union and Central Siberia, as well as joint power systems in the Northwest, West, South Caucasus, Kazakhstan, and Central Asia. It is stipulated that the length of circuit networks with voltages of 35 to 500 kilovolts will increase by about one and a half to two times.

During the seven years, huge measures for the peaceful use of atomic energy will be implemented. A series of atomic energy power stations with various types of reactors will be put into production.

It is expected that the output of the machinery manufacturing and metal processing industries will almost double.

During the period of 1959-1965, the machinery manufacturing industry will ensure: the manufacture of the latest equipment for all sectors of the national economy; the creation and manufacture of machines based on the latest achievements and discoveries in science and technology, especially on the basis of using radio electronics, superconducting states, ultrasonic waves, radioactive isotopes, semiconductors, and nuclear energy; the further development of specialization and collaboration of enterprises, etc. It is stipulated that at least 1,300 automatic production lines will be put into production.

It is expected that the output of metal-cutting machine tools will increase by about half, automatic and semi-automatic production lines will increase by 90% to 110%, turbines will increase by 1.8 to 2 times, and automobiles will increase by 70%.

The total output of light industry will increase by about half in seven years. By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the total output of textiles, clothing, and shoes in the Soviet Union and the output per capita will be close to the level of the United States.

It is expected to build about 156 new large-scale light industry enterprises, and to complete 114 enterprises that began construction before 1959.

Agricultural Development

During the seven years, the Soviet Union will catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in the output of a series of important foods calculated per capita in a series of important grains.

The output of daily necessities will double.

While formulating plans for further development of agriculture, it is necessary to improve socialist production relations so that the two types of socialist ownership—collective farm ownership and ownership by the whole people—gradually merge into one. With the development of collective farm production, the material and welfare needs of collective farmers will be increasingly met by the public economy, so their individual sideline occupations will gradually lose their role.

The outline states that by the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the Soviet Union's annual grain output will reach 10 billion to 11 billion poods, seed cotton output will reach 5.7 million to 6.1 million tons, and sugar beets will reach 70 million to 78 million tons. The output of major agricultural products per 100 hectares of agricultural land will exceed the current output of these agricultural products per 100 hectares of agricultural land in the United States. Striving to expand the mechanization and electrification of production and further equipping collective farms and state farms with advanced technology and equipment is one of the decisive conditions for completing the agricultural development plan for 1959-1965.

More than 1 million tractors, nearly 400,000 grain combines, and a large number of other machines will be manufactured for agriculture in seven years. Agricultural electricity consumption will increase by about three times.

In terms of the development of transportation and postal and telecommunications services, the outline stipulates that the freight turnover of railway transportation will increase by 40% to 45% in seven years. The length of railways using electric locomotives and internal combustion locomotives will reach about 100,000 kilometers. The Soviet Union's electrified railway network will increase by about two times.

The freight turnover of sea transportation will increase by about two times in seven years, while the freight turnover of river transportation will increase by about 60%.

Due to the adoption of fast, high-capacity turbojet aircraft and turboprop aircraft, air transportation will become one of the main modes of passenger transportation. Air transport volume will increase by about five times in seven years. It is planned to renovate and build more than 90 airports.

The outline states that in 1959-1965, the amount of state capital construction investment will increase by 80% compared to the previous seven years, almost equal to the total amount of capital construction investment in the national economy over the years since the establishment of the Soviet regime.

The amount of industrial investment in this period will almost double compared to the past seven years.

The tasks stipulated by the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan guarantee the further specialization and comprehensive development of the economies of the various republics and major economic regions, such as the Urals, Siberia, Central Asia, and the South Caucasus. The main changes in the deployment of productive forces lie primarily in accelerating the development of the economies of the eastern regions of the country (including the Urals, Siberia, the Far East, Kazakhstan, and Central Asia). For example, the development of the coal industry in Siberia and Kazakhstan will exceed that of other regions. It is planned to improve the distribution of the oil industry and gas industry, and to prioritize the development of the oil industry and gas industry in the European region of the Soviet Union and Central Asia. The outline elaborates in detail on the distribution of productive forces and economic development in the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, and all other Soviet republics.

Improvement of the People's Material Welfare and Cultural Level

The control figures of the Seven-Year Plan stipulate greatly improving the material welfare and cultural level of the Soviet people. The national income in 1965 will increase by 62% to 65% compared to 1958. The funds used for consumption will increase by 60% to 63% in seven years. The number of employees in all sectors of the national economy will increase by about 11.5 million, an increase of 21%, and the total number of employees will reach 66 million. The real wages of employees will increase by an average of 40%, and the increase in the real income of collective farmers will also be no less than 40%. The preferential treatment system will also be further improved.

The outline points out that for most employees, it is more convenient to implement a six-day work week with five or six hours of work per day than to implement a seven-hour work day with one day off per week. Based on this situation, it is recommended to implement a five-day work week, that is, stipulating two days off per week. It is planned to transition to shortened work days and reduced weekly working days without reducing wages. In this way, the Soviet Union's work day and work week will be the shortest in the world.

With the improvement of industrial and agricultural production and the increase in residents' income, the retail sales of state-owned trade and cooperative trade should increase by 57% to 62% in seven years (calculated at comparable prices). The policy of reducing prices will continue to be implemented in the future.

A plan has been drawn up to further improve residents' health care. Investment in this area is 25.4 billion rubles, an increase of 80% compared to the investment amount in 1952-1958.

The outline extensively discusses issues such as communist education, national education, and the development of science and culture. The outline stipulates vigorously developing general secondary education in urban and rural areas and promoting higher and secondary specialized education in the form of night schools and correspondence courses. By 1965, the number of students should increase to 38 million to 40 million, while it was 30 million in 1958. The transition from seven-year universal compulsory education to eight-year universal compulsory education will be realized. During the period from 1959 to 1965, the number of graduates from higher education institutions will reach 2.3 million, while the number of graduates from higher education institutions in the past seven years was 1.7 million.

In science, a broad plan for scientific research work will be implemented, concentrating the human and material resources of the scientific community to engage in the most important research work that is both theoretically significant and practically meaningful. The outline states that Soviet scientists who have revealed the mysteries of atomic and thermonuclear reactions and manufactured artificial earth satellites should enrich science with greater inventions and achievements. For example, Soviet physicists will focus their efforts on studying cosmic rays, atomic nuclear reactions, and semiconductors.

Film, newspapers, radio, and television will all have extensive development in the next seven years. About 100 new television centers and television stations will be built. In 1965, the number of books published will increase to 1.6 billion copies, the circulation of magazines will double, and the annual circulation of newspapers will increase by half.

Great Significance of Implementing the Seven-Year Plan

The report outline emphasizes that the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan will be a new and important stage in the peaceful economic competition between the two systems—the socialist system and the capitalist system. The main point of the Seven-Year Plan is to ensure the further development of the national economy and the improvement of the people's living standards, thereby winning the victory over capitalist countries in peaceful competition. The results of the Seven-Year Plan will enable the Soviet Union to surpass the most developed capitalist countries in Europe—Britain and West Germany—in terms of industrial output per capita, and rank first in Europe. By 1965, the Soviet Union will surpass the current level of industrial production in the United States in terms of the absolute production of certain of the most important products. And for other products, it will approach the current level of production in the United States. In terms of the total output of the most important agricultural products and the output calculated per capita, the Soviet Union will surpass the current level of the United States.

The outline states that the Soviet Union's superiority in terms of production growth rate will create a realistic basis for the Soviet Union to catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of production level calculated per capita in about another five years after 1965. By that time, or perhaps even earlier, the Soviet Union will rank first in the world in terms of both the absolute quantity of production and the output calculated per capita, thus guaranteeing residents the highest living standards in the world. This will be a victory of world-historical significance for socialism in peaceful competition with capitalism.

The outline points out that the international significance of the Seven-Year Plan lies in the fact that the completion of this plan means the further strengthening of the power of the world socialist system. The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that the Soviet Union will comprehensively develop economic cooperation with all socialist countries.

The outline states that in 1965, when the Seven-Year Plan is completed, the total industrial output value of socialist countries will account for more than half of the world's industrial output value. Currently, it accounts for about one-third. In this short period, the socialist world system will have an absolute advantage over the capitalist system in the field of material production—the decisive field of human activity.

In 1965, the Soviet Union's foreign trade volume with socialist countries will increase by more than 50% compared to 1958. The Soviet Union's peaceful construction economic plan has opened up broad prospects for the development of the Soviet Union's foreign trade. The Soviet Union is able and willing to develop economic ties and trade with all countries.

The outline states that the development and prosperity of the Soviet Union and the socialist world system will help the working class and all working people in capitalist countries to fight for their own vital interests, for peace, democracy, and socialism.

Khrushchev's report outline points out that the achievements of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries not only do not threaten anyone, but are a guarantee for maintaining peace and the security of all peoples. The Seven-Year Plan is a concrete proposal made by the Soviet Union to the capitalist world to conduct peaceful economic competition, because the Soviet Union opposes the arms race carried out by the imperialist groups of Western countries.

The outline emphasizes that the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan will further strengthen the economic power, defense power, and unity of the socialist world system, will greatly strengthen the position of peace-loving forces throughout the world, will set new insurmountable obstacles on the path of war provocateurs, and will once again prove the correctness of the Marxist-Leninist principle proposed by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that it is possible to prevent war in the current era.

The report outline emphasizes that the Communist Party is the leading and organizing force of the Soviet people in the struggle for the victory of communism. The great tasks put forward in the Seven-Year Plan require the broad masses of working people to further improve their communist consciousness. The outline states that the Party is creatively developing Marxism-Leninism, and is carrying out resolute struggles against those who stick to conventions, against those who are conservatives, and against those who oppose implementing the Party's general line of Leninism. The outline states that the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union exposed and smashed the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov, who participated in their gang. This anti-Party group once opposed the Party's Leninist general line, opposed the political direction adopted by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, opposed the Party's leadership role, and embarked on the path of sectarian separatist activities.

The outline states that after the Communist Party of the Soviet Union eliminated the anti-Party group, it further strengthened the Leninist unity of its ranks, making them more closely united under the great banner of Marxism-Leninism.

Khrushchev's report outline emphasizes that due to the victory of socialism, the Soviet Union has entered a new historical period of gradual transition from socialism to communism.

The Soviet Union's fifteen-year long-term plan will create the necessary conditions for completing the transition to communism. The implementation of the Seven Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet National Economy for 1959 to 1965 will be a decisive stage in building the material and technical base of communism.

The outline states that now, the main task of the Communist Party and its Central Committee is to ensure the unconditional completion of the state's Seven Year Plan for National Economic Development, thereby further strengthening the might of the Soviet Union, and improving the material and cultural living standards of the people.

    沿着走向共产主义的道路加速发展经济
    赫鲁晓夫关于苏联七年计划控制数字的报告提纲摘要
    新华社14日讯　塔斯社莫斯科14日讯：这里发表了苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫将在苏共第二十一次代表大会上作的题为“1959—1965年发展苏联国民经济的控制数字”的报告提纲，以便在代表大会召开之前让全国对这个计划进行广泛的讨论。
    报告提纲指出，苏联人民实现了非常巨大的改革，使得苏联有可能进入一个新的最重要的发展时期——开展共产主义社会建设的时期。这个时期的主要任务将是全面地建立共产主义的物质技术基础、进一步加强苏联的经济和国防力量，同时更加充分地满足苏联人民的物质和精神需要。
    这将是同资本主义世界竞赛的决定性阶段，这个竞赛中将实际完成一项历史任务——在按人口计算的总产值方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    提纲说，1959—1965年发展国民经济控制数字是今后十五年远景计划的组成部分。这个远景计划是苏联建设共产主义的经济纲领。
    提纲指出，在今后的十五年内，苏联不仅在总产值方面，而且在按人口计算的产值方面都将居世界第一位。
    今后十五年发展苏联国民经济的前景中规定，在这个时期中，具有决定意义的工业部门将使自己的产品增加一倍到二倍。在农业各部门都将有进一步巨大的高涨。
    最近七年（1959—1965年）的根本问题是沿着走向共产主义的道路加速发展国民经济的问题，是在社会主义同资本主义和平经济竞赛中最大限度地赢得时间的问题。
      苏联建设的辉煌成就
    提纲还谈到了自苏维埃政权建立以来苏联在经济和文化建设方面取得的辉煌成就。提纲指出，自从苏维埃政权建立以来，苏联按人口平均计算的国民收入已经增加了十四倍。国民收入的增长反映了国民经济总的高涨和人民生活水平的提高。提纲强调说，在苏维埃政权存在的四十一年中，苏联人民不过只有一半多的时间能从事和平劳动，因为战争和战后恢复被破坏的经济的时期占去了差不多二十年。
    例如，从下面的情况可以看出工业生产的宏伟规模：1958年苏联钢产量将达到五千五百万吨左右，石油开采量将达到一亿一千三百万吨，这意味着目前每月的钢产量和石油开采量比1913年全年的产量还要多。1958年发电量将达到二千三百三十亿度，目前苏联每三天的发电量就等于沙皇俄国的全年发电量。旧俄时代实际上没有化学工业，而目前苏联化学工业的产值已占世界第二位。
    提纲中强调指出，苏联在1958年在生铁、钢、煤、电力、水泥、成材、锯材、棉织品的绝对生产水平方面超过了英国、西德、法国这样一些国家。在黑色金属生产量、铁矿和煤的开采量以及很多机器和仪器的产量方面苏联同美国之间的距离大大缩短了。近年来苏联不仅在增长的速度方面，而且在很多产品，如铁矿砂、生铁、钢、石油、煤、水泥等的每年绝对增产量方面也超过了美国。
    提纲中着重指出，由于最近时期走上了社会主义发展道路的各国取得的成就，社会主义世界体系日益充分地显示出它对资本主义体系的不可争辩的优越性。
    据初步统计，1958年社会主义国家的工业产值将比1937年的产值增加三点九倍。如果考虑一下，1937年只有苏联这个唯一的社会主义国家，那么1937年到1958年社会主义经济体系的工业产值就增加了八点五倍。在同一时期，资本主义国家的工业产值增加了不到一倍，而最近，资本主义国家（美国和一些其他国家）的产值却在不断减少中。
        七年计划的主要任务
    提纲中说，苏联1959—1965年发展国民经济七年计划的主要任务是，在优先发展重工业基础上进一步大力发展所有经济部门，大力加强国家的经济潜力，以保证人民生活水平的不断提高。
    提纲中说，苏联今后七年发展的特点是：社会主义文化的进一步高涨，苏联社会精神财富的进一步增长，共产主义的积极建设者——劳动人民觉悟水平的进一步提高。
    提纲中说，国民经济发展前景计划的出发点是：必须在同最发达的资本主义国家进行的和平经济竞赛中赢得时间，以最快的速度发展经济，特别是具有决定意义的生产部门。
    1959—1965年的控制数字规定：以高速度发展国民经济，同时进行必要的平衡；大量增加黑色金属和有色金属的产量；加速发展化学工业；通过优先发展石油和煤气开采量和生产量的办法来改变燃料生产的结构；主要依靠建设大型火力发电站的办法迅速发展所有国民经济部门的电气化；在电气化和广泛采用内燃机车的基础上进行铁路运输的技术改革；进一步发展所有农业部门；迅速发展住宅建筑。
    提纲说，这个七年计划特别注意进一步开发苏联东部地区的富源。为此规定：在西伯利亚和哈萨克建设力量雄厚的第三个冶金基地；在哈萨克、中亚细亚、乌拉尔、贝加尔湖以东等地区大力发展有色冶金业；在西伯利亚利用廉价的煤发展动力工业；高速发展伏尔加河同乌拉尔之间地区的石油和煤气工业和乌兹别克的煤气工业；加速发展苏联东部地区的化学工业。
    与此同时，将利用一切可能来加速发展国家欧洲部分的生产力。
    提纲指出，这个七年计划的特点将是：国民经济一切部门的技术进步，特别是，和平利用原子能的范围将继续扩大。
    提纲说，发展苏联国民经济七年计划的主要方向是和平发展经济和提高人民的福利，而这个计划的完成同时也将进一步加强苏联的国防力量，使它有更充足的准备，来保卫社会主义的成果不受帝国主义侵略者任何阴谋的侵害。
            工业的发展
    提纲指出，1965年苏联的工业总产值大约将比1958年增加80％，其中生产资料的生产增加85％到88％，消费资料的生产增加62％到65％。七年中工业每年平均增产值约为一千三百五十亿卢布，而过去的七年则为九百亿卢布。
    控制数字方案规定加速发展黑色冶金工业，特别是它的铁矿基地。
    1965年生铁的产量将达到六千五百万到七千万吨，即比1958年增加65％到77％，钢产量将达到八千六百万到九千一百万吨，即增加56％到65％，钢材六千五百万到七千万吨，即增加52％到64％。为了保证黑色冶金工业发展所需要的铁矿石，计划开发新的铁矿，主要是露天开采，还要建设许多大型的选矿联合企业。计划开采一亿五千万到一亿六千万吨商品铁矿（二亿三千万—二亿四千五百万吨原铁矿）。
    在1959—1965年计划建成和投入生产的新生产能力为：炼铁能力二千四百万吨到三千万吨，炼钢能力二千八百万到三千六百万吨，轧材生产能力二千三百万到二千九百万吨。
    在发展有色冶金工业方面，规定铝的生产要比1958年大约增加一点八倍，精铜增加90％，镍、镁、钛、锗、矽以及其他有色金属、特别是稀有金属的生产也要大大增加。
    规定在西伯利亚的克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区建立强大的制铝工业，这个基地的霞石岩储量丰富，并且可以顺便获得廉价的水泥和各种苏打产品。
    1965年苏联金刚石的生产大约要比1958年增加十三倍。
    1959—1965年控制数字规定加速发展化学工业，化学工业生产总值大约要增加两倍。新的合成材料（例如，合成纤维要增加十一倍到十三倍）的大规模生产，使得有可能急剧扩大价廉物美的消费品的生产。
    矿物肥料在七年中要增加两倍。在七年中要新建成一百四十多个大型化学企业，改建一百三十多个企业。
    在燃料工业方面，石油和煤气在燃料生产总量中所占的比重要从目前的31％增加到1965年的51％，而煤所占的比重要从59％降低到43％。
    计划在1965年开采石油二亿三千万吨到二亿四千万吨，即比1958年增加一倍多。规定1965年煤气的开采和生产要增加到一千五百亿立方公尺，而1958年为三百亿立方公尺。在七年中大约要建筑二万六千公里的主要煤气管和通往城市的支管。
    提纲中说，今后七年是实现列宁关于苏联全盘电气化思想的决定阶段。
    1965年电力的生产将增加到五千亿度到五千二百亿度，即比1958年增加一倍至一点二倍。各电站的设计发电能力将增加一倍多。
    优先建筑火电站，使得在七年中可以依靠削减对水电建筑的投资来使全国电力站的总发电能力大约可以增加一千万瓩。
    除了强大的火力发电站投入生产外，还规定完成斯大林格勒水电站、布拉次克水电站、克里门楚格水电站、沃特金斯克水电站、布赫塔马水电站和其他水电站的建设。
    在七年期间将建立苏联欧洲部分和中西伯利亚的统一电力系统，以及西北部、西部、南高加索、哈萨克和中亚细亚地区的联合电力系统。规定电压三十五到五百千伏的电路网长度大约增加一倍半到两倍。
    在七年期间将实现和平利用原子能的巨大措施。将有一系列带有各种类型反应堆的原子能发电站投入生产。
    预计机器制造业和金属加工业的产量增加将近一倍。
    在1959—1965年期间，机器制造业将保证：为国民经济各部门制造最新设备；在利用科学技术最新成就和发现的基础上，特别是在利用无线电电子学、超导状态、超声波、放射性同位素、半导体、核能的基础上创造和制造机器；进一步发展各企业的专业分工和协作等等。规定至少有一千三百条自动作业线投入生产。
    预计金属切削机床的产量将增加大约一半，自动和半自动作业线增加90％到110％，涡轮机增加一点八倍到二倍，汽车增加70％。
    七年间轻工业的总产量将增加大约半倍。在七年计划结束时，苏联的纺织品，衣服和鞋类的总产量和按人口平均的产量将接近美国的水平。
    预计建设大约一百五十六个轻工业的新的大型企业，并且将完成1959年以前开始建设的一百一十四个企业。
            农业的发展
    在七年当中苏联将在一系列重要粮食按人口平均计算的一系列重要食品的产量将赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。
      日常生活必需品的产量将增加一倍。
    在制定进一步发展农业计划的同时要改善社会主义的生产关系，使两种社会主义所有制——集体农庄所有制和全民所有制逐步合而为一。随着集体农庄生产的发展，集体农民的物质和福利需要将越来越多地依靠公有经济得到满足，因此他们的个人副业将逐渐失去它的作用。
    提纲说，到七年计划结束时，苏联谷物的年产量将达到一百亿到一百一十亿普特，籽棉产量将达到五百七十万吨到六百一十万吨，甜菜将达到七千万到七千八百万吨。在每一百公顷农业用地上的主要农产品产量将超过美国每一百公顷农业用地上的这些农产品的目前产量。竭力扩大生产的机械化和电气化、进一步用先进技术设备装备集体农庄和国营农场是完成1959—1965年农业发展计划的决定性条件之一。
    在七年内将为农业制造一百多万台拖拉机、将近四十万台谷物联合收割机和大量其他机器。农业电力消耗量将增加三倍左右。
    在交通运输和邮电发展方面，提纲规定七年内铁路运输货物周转量将增加40％到45％。使用电气机车和内燃机车的铁路长度将达到十万公里左右。苏联电气化铁路网将增加两倍左右。
    七年内海运货物周转量将增加一倍左右，而河运货物周转量将增加60％左右。
    由于采用速度快、座位多的涡轮喷气飞机和涡轮螺旋桨飞机，空运将成为客运的主要方式之一。七年内空运量将增加五倍左右。计划改建和兴建九十多个飞机场。
    提纲说，在1959—1965年间，国家基本建设投资额将比以前的七年增加80％，几乎等于苏维埃政权建立以来历年国民经济基本建设投资额的总和。
    这一时期工业投资额将比过去七年增加一倍左右。
    七年计划控制数字规定的任务保证各加盟共和国和大的经济地区，如：乌拉尔、西伯利亚、中亚细亚、南高加索的经济进一步专业化和综合发展。生产力部署方面的主要变化首先在于加速发展国家东部地区（包括乌拉尔、西伯利亚、远东、哈萨克和中亚细亚）的经济。例如西伯利亚和哈萨克地区煤炭工业的发展将超过其他地区。计划改进石油工业和煤气工业的分布状况，将优先发展苏联欧洲地区和中亚细亚地区的石油工业和煤气工业。提纲中详细阐述了俄罗斯联邦、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、乌兹别克和苏联所有其他加盟共和国生产力分布和经济发展的情况。人民物质福利和文化水平的提高
    七年计划的控制数字规定大力提高苏联人民的物质福利和文化水平。1965年的国民收入将比1958年增加62％到65％。在七年内用于消费的资金将增加60％到63％。国民经济各部门中的职工人数将大约增加一千一百五十万，即增加21％，职工总数将共达六千六百万人。职工的实际工资平均将增加40％，集体农民实际收入的增加额也将不少于40％。优抚金制度也将进一步改善。
    提纲中指出，对大多数职工来说比较方便的不是实行五、六小时工作日的六天工作周制度，而是实行每周有两个休息天的六、七小时工作日的制度，根据这一情况建议实行五天工作周制，即每周规定有两个休息天。计划在不降低工资的情况下过渡到缩短工作日和减少每周工作日数。这样一来，苏联的工作日和工作周都将是世界上最短的。
    随着工农业生产的提高和居民收入的增加，国营贸易和合作社贸易的零售额在七年内要提高57％到62％（按比较价格计算）。以后将继续实行降低物价的方针。
    拟定了进一步改进居民的保健工作的计划。对这方面的投资为二百五十四亿卢布，即比1952—1958年的投资额增加80％。
    提纲中广泛地谈到了共产主义教育、国民教育、科学文化的发展等方面的问题。提纲规定在城市和乡村地区大力发展普通中等教育和推广夜校形式的和函授的高等和中等专科教育。到1965年，学生人数要增加到三千八百万至四千万人，而1958年是三千万人。将实现从七年制普及义务教育向八年制普及义务教育的过渡。在1959年到1965年期间内，高等学校的毕业生将达二百三十万人，而过去七年的高等学校毕业生人数是一百七十万人。
    在科学方面，要实现广泛的科学研究工作计划，集中科学界的人力和物力来从事既有理论意义又有实践意义的最重要的研究工作。提纲中说，揭示了原子和热核反应奥秘的、制造了人造地球卫星的苏联科学家要以更大的发明和成就来丰富科学。譬如说，苏联的物理学家们将集中力量研究宇宙线、原子核反应和半导体等问题。
    电影、报刊、广播、电视在今后七年内都要有广泛的发展。将建造一百个左右的新电视中心和电视台。1965年，书籍发行量要增加到十六亿册，杂志发行量增加一倍，报纸的年发行量增加一半。
    实现七年计划的伟大意义
    报告提纲强调指出，实现七年计划将是两个体系——社会主义体系和资本主义体系和平经济竞赛的新的重要阶段。七年计划中的主要之点在于：保证国家经济的进一步发展和人民生活水平的提高，从而在和平竞赛中赢得对于资本主义国家的胜利。七年计划执行结果将使苏联按人口平均计算的工业产量超过目前欧洲最发达的资本主义国家——英国和西德，而占欧洲的第一位。到1965年，苏联在某些种最重要的产品的绝对生产量方面将超过美国现在的工业生产水平。而另一些产品则接近美国现在的生产水平。在最重要的农产品的总产量和按人口平均计算的产量方面，苏联将超过美国现在的水平。
    提纲说，苏联在生产增长速度方面的优越性将造成现实的基础，使苏联在1965年以后大约再用五年的时间使按人口平均计算的生产水平赶上和超过美国。到那时候，也可能还早一些，苏联无论在生产的绝对数量方面，或者在按人口平均计算的产量方面，都将居于世界第一位，这样就将保证居民具有世界上最高的生活水平。这将是社会主义在同资本主义和平竞赛方面的具有世界历史意义的胜利。
    提纲中指出，七年计划的国际意义在于：完成这个计划意味着世界社会主义体系的威力进一步加强。七年计划规定苏联同所有的社会主义国家全面地发展经济合作。
    提纲说，在1965年七年计划完成的时候，社会主义国家的工业生产总值将占全世界工业产值的一半以上。而目前约占三分之一。这样一来，在这个短短的时期内，在物质生产——人类活动具有决定意义的领域内，社会主义世界体系将对资本主义体系占绝对优势。
    1965年，苏联同社会主义国家的对外贸易额将比1958年增加50％以上。苏联的和平建设经济计划为发展苏联的对外贸易开辟了广阔的前景。苏联可能而且愿意同所有国家发展经济联系和贸易。
    提纲中说，苏联和社会主义世界体系的发展和繁荣有助于资本主义国家的工人阶级和全体劳动人民为自己的切身利益、为和平、民主和社会主义而进行斗争。
    赫鲁晓夫的报告提纲中指出，苏联和其他社会主义国家的成就不仅不威胁任何人，而且是维护和平和各国人民安全的保证。七年计划是苏联向资本主义世界提出的进行和平经济竞赛的具体建议，因为苏联反对西方国家帝国主义集团所进行的军备竞赛。
    提纲强调说：七年计划的实现将进一步加强社会主义世界体系的经济威力、国防威力和团结一致，将大大加强全世界爱好和平力量的阵地，将在战争挑拨者的道路上设下新的不可克服的障碍，将再一次证明苏联共产党第二十次代表大会提出的关于现时代有可能制止战争这一马克思列宁主义原理的正确性。
    报告提纲强调指出，共产党是苏联人民为共产主义胜利而斗争的领导力量和组织力量。七年计划中提出的伟大任务要求广大的劳动人民群众进一步提高共产主义觉悟。提纲说，党创造性地发展着马克思列宁主义，同那些墨守陈规的人，同那些保守主义者和反对贯彻党的列宁主义总路线的人进行坚决的斗争。提纲说，苏联共产党中央委员会六月全会揭露和粉碎了马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和参与他们一伙的谢皮洛夫反党集团，这个反党集团曾经反对党的列宁主义总路线，反对苏共第二十次代表大会采取的政治方针，反对党的领导作用，并且走上了宗派分裂活动的道路。
    提纲说，苏联共产党把反党集团铲除以后，就更加加强了自己队伍的列宁主义团结一致，使他们更加紧密地团结在马克思列宁主义的伟大旗帜下。
    赫鲁晓夫的报告提纲中强调指出，由于社会主义的胜利，苏联已进入由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的新的历史时期。
    苏联十五年远景计划将为完成向共产主义过渡创造必要的条件。实现1959到1965年苏联国民经济发展七年计划将是建立共产主义物质技术基础的决定性阶段。
    提纲中说，现在，共产党、它的中央委员会的主要任务是保证无条件地完成国家的国民经济发展七年计划，从而更加加强苏联的威力，更加提高人民的物质和文化生活水平。（附图片）	苏联　弗米切夫
