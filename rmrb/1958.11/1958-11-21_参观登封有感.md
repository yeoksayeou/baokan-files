    Impressions of Visiting Dengfeng
    Chen Huangmei
    I.
    Thousands of blast furnaces tower like forests,
    The iron and steel army spreads across the mountains,
    To sweep away the Funiu Mountains,
    Heroes vie to seize the commander's banner.
    The sound of war drums urges the sun to set,
    The furnace fire illuminates the Ying River,
    Thick smoke locks Mount Song,
    The iron flow surges, shaking the Central岳.

    II.
    Arriving in Dengfeng County,
    One immediately feels a broader perspective,
    Looking up at Mount Song,
    White clouds entwine its waist.
    Double leap forward in production and culture,
    Ambitions are even higher than Mount Song.
    Who says poverty and ignorance cannot be swept away?
    We will have white sand in the reservoir,
    The Ying River flowing in its channel,
    Mount Song and the Funiu Mountains both offering treasures!
    Regardless of men, women, old, or young,
    Everyone has poetic inspiration.
    Look at the small blast furnaces,
    Poetry-reciting platforms towering everywhere,
    How many heroes are there!
    We will make steel, grain, and satellites fly in swarms,
    Flying over the Central岳,
    Breaking through the clouds.

    参观登封有感
    陈荒煤
    一
    高炉万千耸如林，
    钢铁大军遍山坡，
    要把伏牛一扫平，
    英雄竞将帅旗夺。
    战鼓声声催日落，
    炉火万丈照颍河，
    浓烟如云锁嵩山，
    铁流奔腾震中岳。
    二
    来到登封县，
    顿觉眼界高，
    抬头望嵩山，
    白云缠住腰。
    生产文化双跃进，
    雄心还比嵩山高。
    谁说一穷二白不能横扫？
    要白沙入库，
    颍河归槽，
    嵩山伏牛齐献宝！
    不分男女老少，
    个个诗兴豪。
    看小高炉、
    诵诗台到处高耸入云，
    英雄知多少！
    管叫钢铁粮食卫星成群抛，
    飞过中岳，
    冲破云霄。
