    Eradicating Drought in Hexi, Transforming Deserts into Fertile Land:
    Gansu's Ten-Thousand-Li "Green Great Wall" to be Completed This Year
    (Our newspaper's Lanzhou dispatch) A great project, a "Green Great Wall" comparable to the actual Great Wall, will be successfully completed across the entire western part of Gansu Province within this year. This is a communist construction project where the people of Gansu, with their fearless heroic spirit, are subduing the desert.
    This "Green Great Wall" starts from the shores of Hala Lake in Dunhuang County, at the westernmost end of Gansu, and extends eastward along the northern edge of the Hexi Corridor, along the ancient Great Wall and the edge of the Tengger Desert, passing through sixteen counties and cities, to Gulang County in the east, where it connects with the northern shelterbelt of Dingxi Prefecture. The main forest belt is over three thousand two hundred li long, with an average width of three li. Added to this are the lengths of over a hundred branch and secondary forest belts, stretching over ten thousand li in length and breadth. The total area of the forest belt is four million eight hundred thousand mu, equivalent to half of the existing cultivated land area of Zhangye Prefecture. It is estimated that in a few years, when the forest belt is all green and shady, it can expand the cultivated land area of Hexi by ten million mu; increase the annual rainfall by one hundred millimeters; and produce twelve thousand cubic meters of timber annually. This will not only change the arid climate of the Hexi Corridor, but also establish a base for transforming the desert and Gobi.
    The construction of this ten-thousand-li forest belt is not only a manifestation of the strong will of the people of Gansu to conquer nature, but also marks a new development in China's afforestation cause. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the counties had already built over one million mu of small forest belts. In 1957, with the assistance of the Ministry of Forestry, the survey and design for building the "Green Great Wall" was completed. This spring, under the leadership of the local Party and government organizations, a million-strong army was mobilized, and after a "spring offensive," two million mu of trees were planted in the desert, completing 67% of the "Green Great Wall" afforestation plan. Now, the people's communes living at the forefront of the wind and sand are launching an even larger-scale autumn afforestation assault campaign. They are determined to complete the planting tasks originally scheduled for next spring in one fell swoop within this year. At the same time, Zhangye Prefecture recently reorganized a survey of the entire forest belt, and put forward a comprehensive overall plan for the "Green Great Wall": (1) ensure that all planting is done and all survive; (2) make the forest belt water-conserving; (3) establish and improve maintenance organizations and systems in each county along the forest belt. This new plan guarantees realization within next year.
    The desert and Gobi area of the Hexi Corridor is approximately close to two hundred million mu, accounting for one-eighth of China's total desert area, and wind and sand have become an important source of various natural disasters here. In the old society, people regarded wind and sand as an irresistible "god." Seven years ago, the people of Minqin County, surrounded by wind and sand on three sides, under the guidance of the Party, abandoned the superstition of praying to the "Sand God," and first raised the red flag of greening the desert. After building a 1.42 million mu sand control forest belt, the people's minds were liberated, and the road to large-scale greening of the desert was opened up. Subsequently, the "Greening the Desert" movement spread widely in various counties.
    Now, many places have connected points into belts, and belts into nets. Places where "you could hear people but not see them, and had to light an oil lamp indoors during the day" in the past, now present a prosperous scene of "green trees providing shade and flowers filling the courtyard, wheat waves rolling and cotton bolls big." For example, Minqin County has reclaimed 420,000 mu from the sand, and this year's grain yield per mu is as high as 660 jin, more than six times higher than before liberation, with an average of more than 2,500 jin of grain per person.
    The achievement of these achievements fully demonstrates the communist heroic qualities of the awakened masses, who dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, and creatively display endless wisdom and strength. According to the different types of mobile dunes, fixed dunes, isolated dunes, and windward sand ridges, they adopt comprehensive measures such as afforestation, planting grass, covering sand dunes with soil, inserting wind walls, building wind barriers, mechanical afforestation, and aerial seeding to prevent and fix sand. In order to bury a sand dune, it is often necessary to flatten it, dig trenches and excavate soil from a distance, and laboriously carry the soil to the high sand dune; when the soil and seedlings are blown away by the wind, they are replaced with another layer. This year, tens of thousands of people climbed the Qilian Mountains and stayed overnight in the Gobi, collecting 12 million jin of tree seeds for the "Green Great Wall." In order to prevent the seedlings from being scorched to death by the scorching sun and increase the survival rate, the heroes also used their hands to split the Gobi and line the channels with pebbles to introduce water into the desert. In this vast forest belt, they have built 2,257 large and small channels, with a total length of 551 li, and dug 5,661 wells. Recently, the people's communes along the forest belt have also established more than 420 specialized forestry farms, providing a guarantee for comprehensive construction and maintenance of the "Green Great Wall" in a fast, good, economical, and all-round way.

### 根治河西干旱变沙漠为良田  甘肃万里“绿色长城”年内完工

    根治河西干旱变沙漠为良田
    甘肃万里“绿色长城”年内完工
    本报兰州讯　一条可与万里长城媲美的“绿色长城”的伟大工程，年内将在甘肃西部全线营造成功。这是甘肃人民以大无畏的英雄气概，降服沙漠的一项共产主义建设。
    这条“绿色长城”，从甘肃最西端敦煌县境的哈拉湖畔，沿河西走廊北部古长城和腾格里大沙漠的边缘，向东延伸，经过十六个县市，东至古浪县，与定西专区北部防护林带衔接。基干林带全长三千二百余里，平均宽度为三里。再加上百余条支干林带和副林带的长度，纵横长达一万余里。林带总面积为四百八十万亩，相当于张掖专区现有耕地面积的一半。据估计，几年以后林带全部显绿成荫，可以使河西扩大耕地面积一千万亩；每年降雨量增加一百公厘；年产木材十二万立方公尺。这不仅可以改变河西走廊干旱的气候，而且为改造沙漠戈壁建立了根据地。
    营造这条万里林带，不仅是甘肃人民征服自然坚强意志的表现，而且标志着我国造林事业的新发展。在第一个五年计划期间，各县已营造小型林带一百余万亩。1957年，在中央林业部的协助下，完成了营造“绿色长城”的调查设计，今春在当地党政组织领导下，出动百万雄师，经过一个“春季攻势”，即在沙漠上造林两百万亩，至此“绿色长城”的造林计划已完成67％。现在，居住在风沙前沿阵地的各人民公社，正在开展一个更大规模的秋季造林突击战役，他们决心将原定明春完成的播种植树任务，提前在年内一举建成。同时，张掖专区最近重新对整个林带组织了一次调查，提出一个“绿色长城”的全面综合规划：（一）保证做到全种全活；（二）林带水利化；（三）沿林带各县建立和健全养护组织和制度。这一新的规划保证在明年内实现。
    河西走廊的沙漠戈壁面积约近两亿亩，占我国沙漠总面积的八分之一，风沙成为这里各种自然灾害的重要根源。在旧社会，人们把风沙奉为不可抗拒的“神灵”。七年以前，处在风沙三面包围的民勤县人民，在党的教导下，抛弃了祈祭“沙神”的迷信，首先举起绿化沙漠的红旗，营造起一百四十二万亩防沙林带以后，解放了人们的思想，开辟了大规模绿化沙漠的道路。接着，“绿化沙漠”运动即在各县广泛形成。
    现在许多地方已经连点成带，连带成网。过去“对面闻声不见人，白天屋内点油灯”的地方，如今有许多地方呈现“绿树成荫满庭花，麦浪滚滚棉桃大”的繁荣景象。例如民勤县已与沙争地四十二万亩，今年的粮食单位产量高达六百六十斤，比解放前增长六倍多，平均每人有粮二千五百余斤。
    这些成就的取得，充分显示出觉悟了的群众所具有的敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义的英雄本色，创造性地发挥了无穷的智慧和力量。他们根据流动沙丘、固定沙丘、孤立沙丘和迎风沙梁的不同类型，采取造林种草、土压沙丘、插风墙、打风障和机械造林，飞机播种等综合性措施防风固沙。为了埋压一座沙丘，往往要把它削平，从很远的地方劈壕刨土，艰难地把土挑上高大的沙丘；泥土和苗种被风吹跑了，又去补上一层。今年有几万人披星戴月，攀登祁连，夜宿戈壁，为“绿色长城”采集了一千二百万斤的树籽。英雄们为使幼苗不被烈日晒死，提高成活率，还用双手劈开戈壁，用卵石衬砌渠道，把水引进沙漠。在这片辽阔的林带内，他们已修筑起大小渠道二千二百五十七条，共长五百五十一里，打井五千六百六十一眼。最近，沿林带各人民公社又按队建起四百二十多个社办专业林场，为多快好省地全面综合建设和护理“绿色长城”的工作提供了保证。　（翟其寅）
