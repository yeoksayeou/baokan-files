Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 18th: According to a Kyodo News Agency correspondent in Washington, Washington's "Far East experts" are very concerned about the future of the Nobusuke Kishi government. They are worried that the "turmoil" in the Diet caused by the Nobusuke Kishi government's proposal to amend the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law," even if it does not lead to the collapse of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, will cause the cabinet to lose prestige at home and abroad. Moreover, it may inflict irreparable political damage on the future of Japanese conservative forces.

These American "experts" pointed out that Nobusuke Kishi had "negligence" and said that he had forcibly submitted the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment," which would remind people of the pre-war Special Higher Police, to the Diet without obtaining the consent of the people.

The American "experts" are very opposed to the Socialist Party of Japan's refusal to attend the Diet and the struggle of Japanese trade unions and the general public to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi government, believing that this contains "very dangerous factors for democratic politics." These "experts" believe that Nobusuke Kishi's "democratic politics" is currently facing its greatest test since the war. They are very concerned about how Nobusuke Kishi will overcome this crisis.

According to Kyodo News, the struggle of the Socialist Party and the Japanese people against the Nobusuke Kishi government's pursuit of the United States' war policy will "undermine the foundation of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet's diplomatic policy—the policy of cooperation with the United States, which makes the US government, especially officials in the State Department related to Japanese issues, feel worried."

    奴才遭反对　主子怀忧心
    华盛顿人士对岸信介前途惴惴不安
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：据共同社驻华盛顿记者报道，华盛顿的“远东问题专家”对岸信介政府的前途非常耽心。他们耽心岸信介政府提出“警察官职务执行法修正案”所引起的国会的“骚动”，即使不至于使岸信介内阁垮台，也会使这个内阁在国内外丧失威信，不仅如此，而且可能给日本保守势力的前途以无法补偿的政治性的打击。
    这些美国“专家”指出岸信介有“疏忽的地方”，说他在没有取得国民同意的情况下，硬向国会提出了会使人联想起战前特高警察的“警察官职务执行法修正案”。
    美国“专家”们对日本社会党拒绝出席国会，以及对日本工会和一般人民大众所进行的打倒岸信介政府的斗争很反感，认为这样做包含着“对民主政治说来是非常危险的因素”。这些“专家”认为，岸信介的“民主政治”目前已经碰到战后最大的一次考验。他们非常关心岸信介怎样去克服这个危机。
    据共同社透露，社会党和日本人民所进行的反对岸信介政府追随美国的战争政策的斗争，会“破坏岸信介内阁的外交政策的基础——对美合作政策，这一点使美国政府，特别使国务院里面同日本问题有关的官员感到忧虑。”
