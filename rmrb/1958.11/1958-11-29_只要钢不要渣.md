In the iron and steel smelting site of an institution, I saw a moving cartoon: People were operating spiritedly by the steelmaking furnace, while red-hot, surging molten steel was being poured out on one side, and filthy slag labeled "Individualism," "Bourgeois Ideology," etc., was being removed on the other. At the top of the picture were six eye-catching characters: "Only Want Steel, Not Slag!"

This picture is so vivid, profound, and powerful. Originally, the entire people are fighting for steel, which is not only smelting iron and steel, but also tempering people and their thoughts. Countless people have changed their mental outlook and their consciousness has become healthier in the Great Leap Forward in iron and steel production. They have truly achieved a double leap forward and double harvest in steel and thought, killing two birds with one stone. However, those short-sighted "loss theory" advocates cannot see this and cannot understand it.

Each steelmaking furnace is a great furnace for tempering people. The booming and blazing steel fire truly burns away many things in people's consciousness that hinder socialist construction. Everyone is fighting tensely, working selflessly, and in contrast, whoever engages in individualism appears particularly dull and spiritless, and their spiritual world appears small, dark, and out of step with the Great Leap Forward. Many people consciously and automatically bury individualism, greatly broadening their ideological horizons, standing higher, and looking further, tightly uniting individuals and collectives into a torrent of socialist construction.

Countless people have established a noble communist labor attitude in the Great Leap Forward in iron and steel production. Fighting for steel, regardless of day or night, regardless of hours, regardless of remuneration, forgetting sleep and meals, and going all out. When encountering heavy work, difficult work, or hard work, they all rush to be the first, picking the "fat" and discarding the "lean," avoiding the easy and choosing the difficult. Every furnace has a red flame, there are no idle people on the construction site, everyone is full of enthusiasm, and everyone is full of energy. Offering suggestions when seeing a crucible, promoting production when watching a furnace, people are digging their minds and looking for tricks by the furnace construction site, racking their brains, and the atmosphere is enthusiastic. Lofty ideals and honest labor are perfectly combined in the mass steelmaking campaign.

Especially commendable is that the equal relationship among people in labor is fully reflected in the mass steelmaking movement. Everyone is using their hands to smash iron ore, grind refractory mud, or operate and serve by the furnace. Many leading cadres diligently go deep into the front lines, deep into the construction sites, eating, living, and working with the masses, using their hands and brains together to solve problems. In the tense and enthusiastic labor, the estrangement that existed in some places in the past has been broken, and the smiles on the faces of superiors and subordinates and comrades appear particularly familiar. They are in sync with each other in mutual cooperation and mutual support, understanding each other more deeply, and establishing a kind of close and warm relationship. All this helps people cultivate collectivist habits and develop communist thoughts and feelings. Peasants participating in steelmaking, cadres and intellectuals participating in steelmaking, at the same time, helps to eliminate the differences between workers and peasants, and between mental and physical labor. In this extraordinary great battle, the inherent iron-like unity among people has obviously been further strengthened.

All of the above is an inestimable and huge gain in the mass steelmaking movement.

In the great furnace of mass steelmaking, everyone should actively and voluntarily temper themselves painstakingly for a long time, truly forging a body of steel and iron bones, so as to reach the point of "mastery," in order to make more contributions to the magnificent socialist cause.

    只要钢不要渣

    在一个机关的炼铁炼钢工地上，看到一幅动人的漫画：人们精神抖擞地在炼钢炉边操作，一边正在倾泻通红奔腾的钢水，一边正在排除标着“个人主义”“资产阶级思想”等等字样乌七八糟的渣滓。画的上端写着醒目的六个大字：“只要钢，不要渣！”
    这一幅画，多么鲜明，深刻，有力。本来吗，全民为钢而战，既是炼铁炼钢，又是炼人炼思想。无数的人在大炼钢铁中，精神面貌改观，意识益趋健康。真正做到了钢铁、思想双跃进，双丰收，一举两得。而那些短视的“赔本论”者，对此则是看不见，也不能理解的。
    一座座炼钢炉，就是一座座炼人的大洪炉。轰轰烈烈、熊熊的钢火，确实地烧掉了人们意识中许多有碍社会主义建设的东西。人人都在紧张战斗，忘我劳动，相形之下，谁闹个人主义，格外显得灰溜溜，显得精神世界渺小、阴暗，与大跃进步伐不合拍。不少人自觉自动地埋葬起个人主义，使自己思想领域大大开阔起来，站得更高，望得更远，把个人与集体，紧紧地汇成一股建设社会主义的洪流。
    无数的人在大炼钢铁中，树立起了风格高尚的共产主义劳动态度。为钢而战，不分昼夜，不计小时，不讲报酬，废寝忘食，全力以赴。遇到重活、难活、苦活，都是抢先恐后，拣“肥”丢“瘦”，避轻就重。炉炉火苗红，工地无闲人，个个情绪饱满，人人精力充沛。见埚献计，看炉促进，人们在炉边工地挖心思，找窍门，绞尽脑汁，气氛热烈。远大的理想，诚实的劳动在大办钢铁运动中完美地结合了起来。
    尤其难能可贵的，人们在劳动中的平等关系，在全民炼钢运动中充分体现出来。大家都用双手在砸铁矿石，碾耐火泥，或在炉边操作、侍候。许多领导干部辛勤地深入现场，深入工地，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，一齐动手动脑筋，解决问题。在紧张热烈的劳动中，打破了过去有些地方存在的隔阂，上下级间、同志间彼此的笑容音貌，显得格外熟悉，在相互协作、相互支援中心心相印，了解更深，建立起一种亲亲热热的良好关系。这一切，有助于人们培养集体主义习惯，生长共产主义的思想感情。农民参加炼钢，干部、知识分子参加炼钢，同时有助于消灭工农之间、脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的差别。在这一场不平凡的大战中，人们之间固有的钢铁般的团结，显然是进一步地加强了。
    凡此种种，在全民炼钢运动中是无可估量的一笔巨大收获。
    在全民炼钢的大洪炉中每个人应该积极主动地使自己苦炼久炼，真正炼成一副钢筋铁骨，做到“炉火纯青”地步，以便对壮丽的社会主义事业作出更多的贡献。
