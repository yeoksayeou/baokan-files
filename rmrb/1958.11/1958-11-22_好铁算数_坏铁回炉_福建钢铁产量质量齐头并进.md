    In Fujian Province, amidst the nationwide surge in steel production, not only has steel output risen in a straight line, but its quality has also been excellent, receiving consistent praise from user units both inside and outside the province. Currently, some machinery manufacturing plants are directly using high-quality locally produced iron from Fujian to replace foreign iron in casting various machine parts. The local iron transported to Shanghai is not only of good quality but, in some cases, is also in neat blocks, eliminating the need for manual crushing and allowing it to be directly fed into the steel furnace.

    Fujian Province's achievement of simultaneous progress in steel production quantity and quality, despite limited equipment and technical resources, is primarily due to the adoption of methods such as "pre-furnace debate meetings," "battlefield meetings," "Zhuge Liang meetings," and "evaluation meetings." These methods have helped the masses recognize the great significance of large-scale steel production and understand that the purpose of smelting iron and steel is to transform it into steel products and manufacture agricultural machinery. Consequently, they have consciously focused on both quantity and quality. Thus, from coastal areas at the forefront of national defense to remote mountainous regions, battle slogans like "Fight a beautiful battle, strive for both quantity and quality" and "Good iron counts, bad iron goes back to the furnace" have emerged everywhere. Many areas lacking testing equipment go to great lengths, sending people or samples to Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other places for inspection until the products meet the required standards. The masses in many places have also created many indigenous methods for checking quality, such as listening to the sound, observing the iron mouth, and checking sparks, to ensure that the quality of steel meets the standards.

### 好铁算数　坏铁回炉  福建钢铁产量质量齐头并进

    好铁算数　坏铁回炉
    福建钢铁产量质量齐头并进
    据新华社福州电　福建省在全民大搞钢铁生产中，不但钢铁产量直线上升，而且质量良好，受到省内外各使用单位的一致赞扬。目前，有些机械制造厂已直接用福建生产的优质土铁代替洋铁铸造各种机械部件。调运到上海的土铁，不但质量很好，而且有一部分还由于块状整齐，不必再用人工敲碎，就可以直接进炉炼钢。
    福建省在设备、技术力量都很薄弱的情况下，所以出现钢铁产量和质量齐头并进的局面，主要是采取了“炉前辩论会”、“战地会“、“诸葛亮会”、“评比会”等，使群众认识到大搞钢铁生产的伟大意义，看到炼出钢铁是为了变成钢材、制造机器农具，自觉地既抓数量，又抓质量。这样，从海防前哨的沿海地区到偏僻山区，就到处出现“大打漂亮仗，多、好要双全”、“好铁算数、坏铁回炉”等战斗口号。许多没有化验设备的地区，都不辞长途跋涉，派人或把样品寄到福州、厦门等地进行检验，直到产品合格为止。许多地方群众还创造了听声音、看铁口、打火花等许多检查质量的土办法，保证钢铁质量合乎标准。
