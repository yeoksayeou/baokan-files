    The De Lingha Farm is surrounded by hundreds of households of Mongolian, Tibetan, Han, Hui and other ethnic groups. They mainly engage in animal husbandry, cultivating only a small portion of land. Before the establishment of the farm, the masses faced four major difficulties in their lives: no doctors for illnesses, making treatment difficult; no canals, making farming difficult; too few water mills (only one small water mill in the entire area), making it difficult to grind flour; and inconvenient transportation, making it difficult to transport goods.

    After the establishment of the farm, it followed the Party's ethnic policies, implemented the principle of not competing with the people for profits, and helped local residents in various ways. In recent years, it has reclaimed more than 5,500 mu of wasteland and cultivated fields for the masses, built 60 kilometers of canals, cultivated 1,670 mu of land on behalf of the people, harvested more than 2,500 mu of crops, solved the problem of more than 3.34 million jin of feed, repaired more than 1,000 pieces of farm tools, built more than 5,400 houses free of charge, treated more than 16,200 people, and handed over part of the materials to the masses for transportation, increasing the income of the masses by 330,000 yuan. In addition, it also provided convenience to the masses in terms of trade and food.

    The masses are very satisfied with the farm. They generally reflected that the farm has brought us five major benefits: "Increased production, more sideline occupations, timely medical treatment, convenient transportation, and convenient buying and selling." They actively help and support the farm. In the spring planting of 1956, the farm lacked draft animals, so the masses supported 234 head of oxen to help the farm sow seeds.

    群众夸农场
    在德令哈农场周围，居住着数百户蒙、藏、汉、回等民族居民。他们以经营畜牧业为主，耕种着很少一部分土地。在农场未建立前，群众生活方面有四大困难：疾病无医，治疗困难；没有水渠，种地困难；水磨太少（全区只有一个小水磨），吃面困难；交通不便，运输困难。
    农场建立后，遵循党的民族政策，贯彻了不与民争利的原则，并且从各方面帮助当地居民。几年来为群众开荒造田五千五百多亩，修渠六十公里，代耕土地一千六百七十亩，收割庄稼二千五百多亩，解决饲草三百三十四万多斤，修理农具一千多件，无偿修建房屋五千四百多间，治病一万六千二百多人次，并把部分物资交群众运输，增加群众收入三十三万元。此外，在贸易、吃粮等方面，也都处处给群众以便利。
    群众对农场很满意。他们普遍反映：农场给我们带来了五大好处：“生产提高，副业增多，医疗及时，交通便利，买卖方便”。他们主动帮助和支援农场。1956年春播时，农场耕畜缺乏，群众就支援耕牛二百三十四头，帮助农场播种。
