Getting to the Bottom of the Soil
    Cheng Pu
    In agricultural production, if we want to obtain high yields, on the one hand, we need to plant various crops on the land that best suits them according to the principle of "planting according to local conditions"; on the other hand, we need to actively improve the soil and continuously increase soil fertility in order to obtain higher and higher crop yields. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out in its instructions on deep plowing and soil improvement: The core of yield-increasing measures such as water, fertilizer, soil, seed, and density is soil. Because irrigation, fertilization, close planting, and the promotion of improved varieties all require different approaches depending on the nature of the soil. In order to rationally utilize and improve the soil, and to formulate correct agricultural development plans, it is necessary to get to the bottom of the soil. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out soil survey work.
    Some people will say that the vast number of farmers, in their long-term production practice, are already familiar with the local soil conditions, and have accumulated a lot of experience in the rational use of land. Therefore, even without soil surveys, production can still be increased. Indeed, every village has some experienced old farmers who are familiar with the temperaments of the local soil and know which crops should be planted on which land. These experiences of farmers are worth paying attention to, but it cannot be denied that these experiences are still fragmented and unsystematic, and the role they play is not significant. This year, in Nanbu County, Sichuan, many experimental fields with heavily fertilized and carefully cultivated crops did not produce high yields, or the crops lodged extensively, or did not achieve the expected yield increase. This is because of a lack of research on soil and fertilizer, and a lack of sufficient knowledge and methods for rational fertilization according to the needs of the land and crops. There have been similar incidents in other places as well. This requires a systematic scientific investigation of the soil. Of course, in soil surveys, it is necessary to carefully study and absorb the experience of old farmers.
    From the perspective of improving leadership style, soil surveys are even more important. With a thorough understanding of the local soil conditions, it is easier to avoid subjectivism in formulating plans and guiding production.
    Soil survey is a specialized scientific work. Is it possible for ordinary farmers and rural cadres to do soil analysis and testing? The experience of many regions proves that it is entirely possible. Here, we must first break the superstition of soil science. The vast number of farmers and rural work cadres deal with soil all year round. Although they may not have studied soil science, they know a lot about the perceptual knowledge of soil. If they are taught some basic knowledge of soil science and taught how to use several simple soil testing instruments, they will be able to take on the work of soil surveys. Of course, in this work, the assistance of scientific institutions, universities and colleges is also needed. Nanbu County in Sichuan Province, Qin'an County in Gansu Province, and Shibing County in Guizhou Province, etc., have adopted short-term training methods this year to cultivate a large number of soil survey personnel, and successfully completed soil survey work. On this basis, they have drawn up soil improvement plans. Through soil surveys, many cadres have cultivated an interest in studying soil science. As long as they continue to carry forward this spirit of drilling, and combine learning with application, they will surely become a group of soil science experts who integrate theory with practice.
    At present, various regions and people's communes are formulating land use plans and agricultural production plans for next year. This winter and next spring, all localities will vigorously carry out soil improvement, water conservancy construction, afforestation, and fertilizer accumulation and production. All these tasks require research on soil-related data. Therefore, it is necessary to combine these tasks as much as possible and organize forces to widely carry out soil survey work.

    摸清土壤的底
    程浦
    在农业生产中，要想获得高额的产量，一方面需要根据“因地种植”的原则，把各种农作物种植在最适合它们的土地上；另方面又需要积极地改良土壤，不断地提高土壤的肥力，以便获得越来越高的农作物产量。中共中央关于深耕和改良土壤的指示中指出：水肥土种密等增产措施的中心是土。因为灌溉、施肥、密植、推广良种，都需要根据土壤性质的不同而采取不同的做法。为了合理地利用土壤和改良土壤，为了制订正确的农业发展规划，必须摸清土壤的底。因此，开展土壤调查工作就很必要了。
    有人会说，广大农民在长期的生产实践中，已经熟悉了本地的土壤情况，在合理利用土地方面也已经积累了许多经验，因此不调查土壤，一样地可以增产。的确，每个村庄都有一些有经验的老农，熟悉本地土壤的脾气，也懂得哪块地该种什么庄稼。农民的这些经验是值得重视的，但是，不能否认这些经验还零碎不系统，所起的作用还不大。今年四川南部县就有不少大量施肥加工培植的试验田作物产量不高，或者作物大量倒伏，或者并未达到预期的增产效果。这就因为对土壤和肥料缺乏研究，对按土地、按作物需要合理施肥缺乏足够的知识和办法。其他地方也有这样的事情。这就要求对于土壤进行有系统的科学的调查。当然，在土壤调查中，需要认真研究和吸取老农的经验。
    从改善领导作风的角度看，土壤调查更有其重要意义。对本地的土壤情况有深入的了解，在制订计划和指导生产当中，就容易避免主观主义的毛病。
    土壤调查是一项专门的科学工作，要一些普通的农民和农村干部来做土壤的分析化验，这能够办到吗？不少地区的经验证明：完全可能。这里首先必须破除对土壤科学的迷信。广大农民和农村工作干部一年到头同土壤打交道，他们虽然不一定读过土壤学，但是对于土壤的感性知识是知道很多的。如果再对他们讲授一些土壤学的基本知识，传授几种简单的土壤测验仪器的使用方法，他们就能够把土壤调查的工作担负起来。当然，在这项工作中，也需要科学机关、大中学校的协助。四川省南部县、甘肃省秦安县、贵州省施秉县等地，今年采取短期训练的办法，培养出一大批土壤调查人材，胜利地完成了土壤调查工作，在这个基础上拟出了改良土壤方案。经过土壤调查，许多干部培养起研究土壤科学的兴趣。只要他们坚持发扬这种钻劲，把学与用结合起来，他们一定能够成为一批理论联系实际的土壤学专家。
    目前各个地区和人民公社正在制订土地利用规划和明年农业生产计划，今冬明春各地都将大力进行改良土壤、水利建设、植树造林、积肥造肥等工作。所有这些工作都需要研究土壤方面的资料。因此，尽可能结合上述这些工作，组织力量广泛开展土壤调查工作。
