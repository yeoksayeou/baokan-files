More than 70 Chinese scientists in Beijing also attended the reception.

Also invited to attend the reception was Totmakov, Science Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China.

Guo Moruo said at the reception: "On the eve of the 41st anniversary of the Great October Revolution, we hold this reception to express our warm congratulations, congratulating the great Soviet people on their brilliant achievements in communist construction under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and government, especially the great achievements of Soviet scientists in science; Our Chinese scientific undertaking, like the entire socialist construction, has received great assistance from the Soviet Union. Today, we take this opportunity to express our heartfelt thanks to the Soviet Party, government, people, the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Soviet scientists, and especially to the Soviet experts and Czech and Polish experts present today."
