Treasures Abound in Sedimentary Rocks
    Shí Gōng

Sediment is constantly accumulating in the oceans, never ceasing. When you grab a handful of sand on the beach, do you ever think that this will be stone billions of years from now? What happens billions of years later cannot be seen, but the stones formed billions of years ago can be found. These stones are collectively called sedimentary rocks, and common ones include limestone, shale, sandstone, and conglomerate. Limestone is formed from the accumulation of seashells in the ocean; shale is mainly composed of clay; sandstone contains a large number of quartz sand grains; and conglomerate clearly shows many pebbles. Although these stones are different from each other, they have a common feature, which is that they are layered. Layered textures can also be seen inside the stones, especially shale, which can even be peeled off layer by layer by hand.

In our work of searching for minerals, we often have to deal with sedimentary rocks. Although sedimentary rocks only account for 5% of the total weight of the earth's crust, they are widely distributed, covering 75% of the earth's surface. Many times we are in sedimentary rock areas, that is, searching for minerals in ancient seabeds and lakebeds.

What minerals can be found in sedimentary rocks? The accumulation of sediments in today's oceans and lakes tells us a lot.

Some time ago, many lake muds that could be used as fuel were excavated from West Lake in China. Why can lake mud be used as fuel? Because over the years, a large number of dead branches, fallen leaves, aquatic plants, and the remains of many other organisms have accumulated at the bottom of the lake. Due to the cover of water and sediment, they did not decay rapidly, but were destroyed by bacteria, releasing oxygen and hydrogen from the remains, leaving carbon behind. The longer the sedimentation time, the greater the proportion of carbon. The days of lake mud accumulation are not too long, and the carbon content is less, so it does not burn very strongly. But it can be imagined that this is the predecessor of coal. Therefore, to find coal, one must go to ancient lakes and marshes. Of course, this also requires that the plants at that time were unusually lush, and lush plants require abundant rainfall and a warm climate. These characteristics are often reflected in the rocks. If a certain characteristic is recognized, we get one more clue to find coal. Petroleum is also created from the remains of organisms, but the environment in which it is generated is different, mostly in bays. To find petroleum, we must go to areas that show this characteristic.

The table salt in the large salt lake in the Qaidam Basin of China is enough for the country's 600 million people (at 10 catties per person per year) to eat for more than 8,000 years. Where does the salt in the salt lake come from? Originally, stones and soil on the earth contain salt. Running water dissolves them and carries them into lakes and seas. If the water in the lake and sea has no outlet, and the climate is very hot and dry, a large amount of lake and sea water evaporates, and the salt has only inflow but no outflow, becoming more and more, and finally when it reaches the point where it can no longer be concentrated, it precipitates on the bottom of the water and accumulates in layers. These accumulations can contain not only a large amount of table salt, but also many other salt substances such as gypsum, borax, mirabilite, etc.

What we see today is the salt lake on the ground. If it is covered by rocks made of mud and sand in the future, it will become an underground mineral deposit. According to this reasoning, if we find ancient inland lakes or bays with hot and dry climates, we have the hope of finding these minerals.

Under other circumstances, it is also possible to create other minerals. Minerals that are not easily worn, such as diamonds, gold, and cassiterite, can accumulate in low-lying areas such as the foothills, estuaries, and bends of riverbeds; some minerals that are soluble in water can also be deposited in suitable environments. For example, a large part of manganese ore and iron ore are formed by sedimentation.

    沉积岩中宝藏多
    石工
    泥沙不断在海洋里堆积，一刻也没有停止过。当你在海滨抓起一把沙子的时候，你想到过这就是亿万年以后的石头没有？亿万年后的事还看不到，但是亿万年前造成的石头却可以找到。这些石头总称沉积岩，常见的有石灰岩、页岩、砂岩、砾岩。石灰岩是海洋中的贝壳堆积而成；页岩的主要成分是粘土；砂岩含有大量的石英砂粒；而砾岩中可以清楚地看出有许多鹅卵石。这些石头尽管各有不同，但却有一个共同的特征，那就是层层相叠。在石头的内部也可以看出成层的纹理，特别是页岩，甚至能用手一层层剥开。
    在我们找寻矿产的工作中，很多时候要和沉积岩打交道。因为沉积岩虽然只占地壳总重量的5％，但是分布很广，覆盖了地面的75％，很多时候我们是在沉积岩区域中，也就是在远古的海底和湖底找矿。
    在沉积岩中能找到什么矿呢？今天的海洋湖沼中沉积物的堆积情况，告诉了我们不少事情。
    前些时候，我国西湖挖出了许多可以作燃料的湖泥。为什么湖泥能作燃料呢？因为多年来在湖底堆积了大量的枯枝、落叶、水草以及其他许多生物的遗体，由于水和泥沙的掩盖，它们没有迅速腐败，而是受着细菌的破坏，将遗体中的氧气、氢气放了出去，碳素留了下来。沉积的时间愈久，碳素所占的比重愈大。湖泥堆积的日子还不太久，含的碳素少些，所以烧起来火力还不太旺。但是可以设想，这正是煤的前身。因此找煤要到古代的湖沼中去找。当然，这还需要那时候的植物是异常繁茂，而繁茂的植物又需要充沛的雨水和温暖的气候。这种种特征，在石头上往往有所反映，如果认出来某种特征了，就多得到一条找煤的线索。石油也是生物遗体造成的，不过生成的环境不同，多在海湾，找石油就要多到表现这种特点的地区中去。
    我国柴达木盆地的大盐池中的食盐，足够全国六亿人口（按每人每年十斤）吃八千多年。盐池里的盐从哪里来的呢？原来地球上的石头、土壤中都含有盐分，流水溶解了它们并将它们带进湖里海里。如果湖里和海里的水没有出口，气候又非常炎热干燥，湖水海水大量蒸发，盐分则有进无出，愈来愈多，终于到了浓得不能再浓的时候，便沉淀在水底，层层堆积。这些堆积物不仅可以有大量的食盐，还有石膏、硼砂、芒硝……等许多其他的盐类物质。
    我们今天看见的是地面的盐池，如果以后被泥沙造成的岩石盖住，就成了地下矿藏，按这个道理推上去，我们找到了古代的气候炎热干燥的内陆湖泊或是海湾，也就有找到这些矿的希望。
    在其他的情况下，也有可能造成其他的矿产，像金刚石、黄金、锡石等不易磨损的矿物，可以在山麓、河口、河床拐弯处等低洼的地方聚集起来；一些能溶于水的矿物也可以在适当的环境中沉积下来，如锰矿、铁矿都有很大一部是沉积而成的。
