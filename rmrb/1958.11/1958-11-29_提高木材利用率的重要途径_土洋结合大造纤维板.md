Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch: Rapidly developing the production of fiberboard is one of the important ways to solve the surging demand for wood. The Ministry of Forestry held a fiberboard on-site meeting here from the 21st to the 24th.

    The meeting analyzed the situation of the rapid growth in demand for wood from all sectors since the Great Leap Forward in production. The meeting believed that in order to guarantee socialist construction, on the one hand, it is necessary to increase the amount of timber felling, but more importantly, how to improve wood utilization. At present, the wood utilization rate of the timber processing department is generally only about 60%, and the remaining 40% or so of the wood is turned into shavings, sawdust, and scraps in the processing process, most of which is burned as fuel. This is a great waste. Developing fiberboard production can make full use of wood waste, increase wood utilization from about 60% to more than 90%, and expand the scope of forest resource utilization, such as bark, tree tops, and tree roots can be used to manufacture fiberboard. In addition, rice straw, wheat straw, cotton stalks, bagasse, bamboo, reeds, water bamboo shells, etc., are also raw materials for manufacturing fiberboard. According to the Ministry of Forestry, the remaining material from felling on the mountains and the remaining material from wood processing account for 30% of the felling volume; and the small materials and shrubs from forest tending and pruning each year are even more. If these wastes are made into fiberboard, it can increase the timber product by more than one-third, and the product cost is only one-half of that of general plates. The quality of fiberboard is also superior to natural wood. Fiberboard that is three millimeters thick has a strength greater than that of natural board that is twelve millimeters thick. Fiberboard eliminates the unavoidable defects in natural wood such as knots, discoloration, bark pockets, and wormholes, and it is not easy to expand, contract, warp, or crack. Fiberboard has a wide range of applications, with more than 300 uses. In terms of use value, each cubic meter of hard fiberboard can replace 5.7 cubic meters of logs.

    The Shanghai No. 1 Lumber Factory introduced its experience in manufacturing fiberboard at the meeting. In the past, China had not produced fiberboard. Many people believed that the production of fiberboard required a complete set of foreign equipment. In October of this year, under the leadership of the Party, this factory launched a mass movement. The workers emancipated their minds, broke superstitions, and most of the equipment was built by using old and substitute equipment from this factory and other factories, doing it themselves, learning, experimenting, building, and producing at the same time. A workshop with an annual output of 600 cubic meters of fiberboard was built within a month. The completion of this workshop combining indigenous and foreign methods has provided a model for the widespread development of fiberboard production. (Photo attached)

    提高木材利用率的重要途径
    土洋结合大造纤维板
    据新华社上海电　迅速发展纤维板的生产，是解决木材需要量激增的重要途径之一。林业部21日到24日在这里召开了纤维板现场会议。
    会议分析了生产大跃进以来，各方面对木材需要量迅速增长的形势。会议认为，为了保证社会主义建设，一方面要增加木材采伐量，但更重要的是如何提高木材利用率。现在木材加工部门的木材利用率，一般只能达到60％左右，其余40％左右的木材，在加工过程中变成了刨花、锯末和碎料，其中大部分作为燃料烧掉，这是一项很大的浪费。发展纤维板生产，可以充分利用木材废料，把木材利用率从60％左右提高到90％以上，并且可以扩大森林资源的利用范围，如树皮、树梢、树根都可用来制造纤维板。此外，稻草、麦秆、棉秆、蔗渣、毛竹、芦苇、茭白壳等，也都是制造纤维板的原料。据林业部计算，仅按山上采伐剩余物和木材加工剩余物，即占采伐量的30％；而林区每年抚育、打枝的小材以及灌木则更多，这些废料如做成纤维板，即可增加三分之一以上的木材产品，产品成本只及一般板材的二分之一。纤维板的质量也较天然木材优越，三公厘厚的纤维板强度比十二公厘厚的天然板还大。纤维板消灭了天然木材中不可避免的节疤、变色、夹皮、虫眼等缺点，并且不容易膨胀、收缩、翘曲、开裂。纤维板的应用范围很广，具有三百多种用途。在使用价值上，每立方公尺的硬质纤维板可顶五点七立方公尺的原木使用。
    上海木材一厂在会上介绍了制造纤维板的经验。我国过去未生产过纤维板。许多人都认为生产纤维板需要一套洋设备。今年10月，这个厂在党的领导下大搞群众运动，职工们解放了思想，破除了迷信，绝大部分设备都是利用本厂和外厂的旧设备和代用设备，自己动手，边学习、边试验、边建设、边生产，一个月内就建成了一个年产六百立方公尺纤维板的车间。这个土洋结合的车间的建成，为普遍发展纤维板生产提供了榜样。（附图片）
