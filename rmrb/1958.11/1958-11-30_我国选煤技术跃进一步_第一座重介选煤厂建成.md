Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang News – China's first heavy medium coal washing plant, marking a leap forward in China's coal washing technology, was recently completed in Beipiao, Liaoning Province. After industrial testing, the clean coal and middlings it washes have reached the current international level of heavy medium coal washing. Once this coal washing plant is officially put into production, its annual output can reach 400,000 tons.

Heavy medium coal washing involves placing the mined raw coal into a mixture of a certain material and water with a specific gravity, and using the difference in specific gravity between them to separate clean coal and gangue.

Currently, most coal washing plants in China use jigging machines to wash clean coal. Due to the low mechanical efficiency and low clean coal recovery rate of jigging machines, millions of tons of clean coal that could have been used for coking are abandoned every year because they cannot be washed out. Heavy medium coal washing can solve the problem of washing difficult-to-wash coal in China. The clean coal recovery rate of heavy medium coal washing is more than 20% higher than that of jigging machines; the coal washing capacity per unit area is 3.5 times higher than that of jigging machines.

    我国选煤技术跃进一步
    第一座重介选煤厂建成
    据新华社沈阳讯　标志我国选煤技术飞跃发展的我国第一座重介选煤厂，最近在辽宁省的北票建成。经过工业性试验，它所洗选出的精煤和中煤，已经达到目前国际上重介选煤的水平。这座选煤厂正式投入生产以后，年产量可达四十万吨。
    重介选煤是将开采出来的原煤放入某种物料与水混合成一定比重的混合液中，利用它们之间比重不同的关系，将精煤及矸子分离开来。
    目前，我国各地选煤厂大多数是用跳汰机洗选精煤。由于跳汰机的机械效率低，精煤回收率小，所以每年要有成百万吨本来能够用以炼焦的精煤，因为洗选不出来而废弃。重介选煤可以解决我国难选煤的洗选问题。重介选煤的精煤回收率比跳汰机高20％以上；每单位面积的选煤能力比跳汰机高三点五倍。
