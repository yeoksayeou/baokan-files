Xinhua News Agency, Sanmenxia, November 26th. The Sanmenxia Cutoff Project Headquarters announced yesterday: After seven days, twenty-one hours, and forty-five minutes of intense battle, the Sanmenxia cutoff project was basically completed at 6:45 AM on the 25th. Now, the spillway between Shenmen River and Shenmen Island has been completely blocked, and the gate of Guimen River has been installed long ago, so it can be closed for cutoff at any time in the future. From now on, the rolling Yellow River water flowing through this canyon will change its fierce and unruly character from ancient times and obediently follow people's will, rushing down from the twelve comb-tooth holes in the overflowing part on the left bank and the Guimen River on the right bank. The builders of Sanmenxia will smoothly build cofferdams, excavate the dam foundation on the right bank, and pour the dam.

The progress of the Sanmenxia cutoff project was very rapid. Although the river flow has far exceeded the design flow since the cutoff project began to be practiced on the 17th, the Shenmen River water was cut off ahead of schedule at 10:00 PM on the 22nd. Immediately afterwards, the construction workers carried out a raising project on the completed cofferdam, making it more than five meters above the water surface. Starting on the 23rd, they launched a cutoff battle on the spillway in the middle of Shenmen Island, which ended victoriously at 6:45 AM on the 25th. According to the original plan of the cutoff headquarters, the cutoff project would not be completed until December 6th.

At dawn on the 25th, when driver Zhang Zhirong drove a 25-ton truck and threw a 15-ton concrete block into the last gap in the Shenmen River spillway, tightly connecting one end of Shenmen Island with the spur dike (a small dike built with stone), cheers, applause, and firecrackers resounded throughout the Sanmenxia Valley. The Soviet experts who had been waiting all night on Shenmen Island were the first to jump onto the spur dike and shake hands with Chinese engineers and workers to celebrate.

That afternoon, the various armies participating in the cutoff, with the joy of victors, held a celebration meeting together with relevant departments of the Central Government, visiting groups from dozens of water conservancy projects in more than a dozen provinces and cities, and Soviet experts participating in the construction of Sanmenxia. Xing Zhaotang, Deputy Governor of Henan Province, led a delegation to express condolences on behalf of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Henan Provincial People's Committee. Xing Zhaotang read a letter of condolence at the meeting, saying: The victorious completion of the cutoff project marks a new stage in the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub project. This is a great achievement in overcoming the Yellow River water disaster that has been impossible to control in history, accelerating socialist construction, and improving the welfare of the people. Hao Zhizhai, Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, said at the meeting: The achievement of the Sanmenxia cutoff project has further liberated people's minds and once again proved that with the leadership of the Party and close reliance on the masses, we will surely be invincible. Konenkov, the leader of the design representative group of the Leningrad Hydropower Design Branch of the Soviet Union stationed in Sanmenxia, congratulated the victory of the Sanmenxia cutoff on behalf of the Soviet experts and the Soviet people working in Sanmenxia. He said that the construction of Sanmenxia has recorded a glorious page in the history of world water conservancy projects. He wished the builders of Sanmenxia greater achievements in accelerating the second phase of cofferdam construction, foundation pit dewatering, and early flood control and power generation. Lin Yishan, Director of the Yangtze River Basin Planning Commission, Zhang Haifeng, First Secretary of the CPC Sanmenxia Municipal Committee and Secretary of the Engineering Bureau Party Committee, and Li Hao, Second Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, all congratulated the victory of the Sanmenxia cutoff project at the meeting.

    三门峡截流工程神速告成
    战斗八天斩断黄河
    新华社三门峡26日电　黄河三门峡工程截流指挥部昨天宣布：经过七天又二十一时四十五分钟的紧张战斗，三门峡截流工程在25日六时四十五分基本结束。现在神门河和神门岛中间的泄水道已全部堵塞，鬼门河的闸门早已安装好，今后随时可以落闸截流。从此，流经这峡谷的滚滚黄河水，一改自古以来凶猛顽劣的性格，驯服地顺从人们的意志，从左岸溢流部分的十二个梳齿孔和右岸的鬼门河向下奔泄。三门峡的建设者们将顺利地堆筑围堰、开挖右岸大坝基坑和浇筑拦河大坝。
    三门峡截流工程进展非常神速，尽管截流工程从17日开始演习以来，河水流量一直远远超过设计流量，但是神门河河水却提前在22日二十二时被截断了。紧接着，建设工人们对已经筑成的围堰进行了加高工程，使它高出水面五公尺多；从23日开始，又对神门岛中间的泄水道展开截流战斗，到25日六时四十五分就胜利结束。按照截流指挥部原订计划，截流工程要在12月6日才能完成。
    25日清晨，当司机张治荣驾驶着载重二十五吨的汽车，把一块十五吨重的混凝土块投进神门河泄水道的最后一个缺口，将神门岛的一端和戗堤（石料堆筑的一道小堤）紧联在一起的时候，顿时欢呼声、鼓掌声和鞭炮声响彻三门峡谷，通宵守候在神门岛上的苏联专家们，首先跳上戗堤，同中国工程师和工人们握手庆贺。
    这天下午，参加截流的各路大军怀着胜利者万分欢欣的心情，同中央有关部门、十多个省市的几十个水利工程的参观团和参加三门峡建设的苏联专家们，一起举行了庆祝大会。河南省副省长邢肇棠率领一个慰问团，代表中共河南省委和河南省人民委员会前来慰问。邢肇棠在会上宣读慰问信说：截流工程的胜利完成，使三门峡水利枢纽工程进入一个新的阶段，这是战胜历史上无法制服的黄河水患、加速社会主义建设和增进人民福利的伟大成就。水利电力部部长助理郝执斋在会上说：三门峡截流工程的成就，进一步解放了人们的思想，再一次证明有了党的领导，紧紧依靠群众，必定是攻无不克，战无不胜。苏联列宁格勒水电设计分院驻三门峡设计代表组组长康年柯夫，代表在三门峡工作的苏联专家和苏联人民祝贺三门峡的截流胜利。他说三门峡的建设在世界水利工程的史篇上记载下光辉的一页。他预祝三门峡的建设者们，在加速第二期围堰堆筑、基坑抽水工程和提前拦洪、发电中，将取得更大的成就。长江流域规划委员会主任林一山、中共三门峡市委第一书记、工程局党委书记张海峰、市委第二书记李浩，都在会上祝贺三门峡截流工程的胜利。（附图片）
