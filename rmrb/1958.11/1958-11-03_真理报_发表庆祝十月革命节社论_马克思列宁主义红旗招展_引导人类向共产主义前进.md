Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 1st (TASS) - "Pravda" today published an editorial entitled "Marxism-Leninism is the Victorious Banner of the Great October Revolution," stating that the Soviet people, the working people of all socialist countries, and all progressive mankind are preparing to solemnly celebrate the forty-first anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The Great October Revolution was accomplished under the banner of invincible Marxism-Leninism.

The editorial stated that the Communist Party, armed with the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, remained loyal to this scientific ideological banner and took an uncompromising attitude towards any opportunism and revisionism in the workers' movement. The Communist Party mobilized millions of workers and peasants, all working people in our country to realize the great cause of building a new world.

The editorial said that when the Russian workers and peasants seized power and set about establishing the world's first socialist state, many thinkers and politicians of bourgeois society skeptically asserted that the people would not even be able to hold power for a few months. How pitiful and ridiculous all these predictions now seem! The Soviet socialist state, established and managed by the people themselves, has stood as firm as a rock, unshakably for forty-one years. During this period, our country has achieved victories of world historical significance, built socialism and defended its victorious achievements in a fierce struggle against various enemies, ensured the vigorous development of productive forces, science and technology, and improved the material and cultural living standards of millions of people.

The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the establishment of socialism in the Soviet Union are a brilliant victory for Marxism-Leninism. The victory of the socialist revolution in China and a series of other European and Asian countries, and the formation of the world socialist system, have brought new and great victories to this great doctrine. The ideas of socialism and communism, the great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, are generating an increasingly revolutionary influence in the hearts of the working people all over the world, and are promoting the working class in capitalist countries and the people of colonial countries to fight against imperialism, for freedom, national independence and socialism.

The editorial said that Marxism-Leninism expresses the aspirations, hopes and fundamental interests of the working class and all working people, and therefore arouses the crazy hatred of international reactionaries. The imperialist bourgeoisie and its thinkers are trying to find all possible ways to stop the growth of communism and weaken the influence of Marxist-Leninist ideas on the masses.

In the struggle against Marxism-Leninism, international reactionaries have found a group of diligent lackeys - right-wing social democrats and modern revisionists, who shout that the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism is "outdated" and must be revised and modernized so that this doctrine can be accepted by the bourgeoisie. However, their malicious ideas have aroused nothing but contempt and protest in the international communist movement and the workers' movement.

The imperialist bourgeoisie and their lackeys spare no effort in the struggle to penetrate people's minds and hearts. They pay close attention to all kinds of traitors in the socialist camp countries, who are useful to them in slandering Marxism-Leninism and distorting the ideas and practice of communism, so they spare no money for these people and praise them greatly. Those who cut themselves off from the people and society, run counter to patriotism and the sense of responsibility to the motherland, extreme individualists who are obsessed with decadent old ideas, graphomaniacs and madmen, usually accept the temptation of the bourgeoisie. These self-proclaimed judges of history have no healthy roots in life and no common language with the people; their words are like fruit shells blown by the wind.

Marxism-Leninism cannot be overthrown or污(defiled).

The editorial said that Marxism-Leninism is the great truth of life, it reflects the fundamental interests of the working people who make up the majority of the world's population, it answers the most pressing questions raised by the development of modern society, and points out the correct path to the bright world of communism.

Our era is an era of the victory of Marxist-Leninist ideas. This great, ever-vigorous and practical doctrine is being creatively developed by the fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties on the basis of summarizing the facts of contemporary practical life, summarizing the experience of building communism and socialism in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the experience of the international workers' movement and the national liberation movement, and the experience of the people of all countries in striving for world peace.

The editorial concluded by saying that as the Soviet people welcome the forty-first anniversary of the October Revolution, which was victorious under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, they proudly look back on the road they have traveled. The upcoming 21st Congress of the CPSU will study the control figures for the development of the Soviet national economy in 1959-1965, and this congress will unfold a new prospect of moving towards communism before the Soviet people.

    “真理报”发表庆祝十月革命节社论
    马克思列宁主义红旗招展
    引导人类向共产主义前进
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”今天以“马克思列宁主义是伟大十月革命的胜利旗帜”为题发表社论说，苏联人民、一切社会主义国家的劳动人民、全体进步人类正在准备隆重庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十一周年。伟大的十月革命是在战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的旗帜下完成的。
    社论说，共产党用马克思列宁主义学说武装起来，忠于这一科学学说的思想旗帜，对工人运动中的任何机会主义、修正主义采取不调和态度。共产党在我国发动了千千万万工农群众、全体劳动者来实现建设一个新世界的伟大事业。
    社论说，当俄国工人和农民掌握了政权并着手建立世界上第一个社会主义国家的时候，资产阶级社会的许多思想家和政治家用怀疑的口吻断定，人民甚至于不能够把政权保持住几个月。所有这些预言现在看起来该是多么可怜、多么可笑！人民自己建立和管理的苏维埃社会主义国家，坚如磐石一样已经不可动摇地牢固地存在了四十一年。在这个时期内，我国获得了具有世界历史意义的胜利，建成了社会主义并在同各种敌人的残酷斗争中捍卫了自己的胜利果实，保证了生产力、科学和技术的蓬勃发展和千百万人民物质和文化生活水平的提高。
    伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利和社会主义在苏联的建成，是马克思列宁主义的光辉胜利。中国和其他一系列欧洲和亚洲国家社会主义革命的胜利和社会主义的世界体系的建成，给这个伟大学说带来了新的巨大的胜利。社会主义和共产主义的思想，伟大的马克思列宁主义学说正在全世界劳动人民的心目中产生越来越大的革命的影响，推动资本主义国家的工人阶级和殖民地各国人民去进行反对帝国主义、争取自由、民族独立和社会主义的斗争。
    社论说，马克思列宁主义表达了工人阶级和一切劳动者的心愿、希望和根本利益，因而就引起了国际反动派的疯狂仇恨。帝国主义资产阶级及其思想家竭力寻找一切可能的方法来制止共产主义的成长，削弱马克思列宁主义思想对人民群众的影响。
    国际反动派在反对马克思列宁主义的斗争中找到了一群殷勤的走狗——右派社会党人和现代修正主义者，这些人高喊马克思列宁主义学说已经“过时”，必须加以修改，使之现代化，以便这个学说能够为资产阶级所接受。但是，他们恶毒的思想在国际共产主义运动和工人运动中除了引起蔑视和抗议以外，引不起任何其他的反应。
    帝国主义资产阶级和他们的走狗在打入人的思想和心灵的斗争中是不惜任何手段的。他们密切地注意着社会主义阵营国家中形形色色的叛徒，这些人在诬蔑马克思列宁主义、歪曲共产主义的思想和实践方面对他们是有用处的，所以他们对这些人就不惜花费大量的金钱，对他们大加吹捧。那些自绝于人民和社会的人、同爱国主义和对祖国的责任感背道而驰、迷恋于腐朽的旧观念的极端个人主义者、写作狂和疯子们，通常会接受资产阶级的诱惑。这些自封为历史审判者的人，在生活中没有任何健康的根基，同人民没有共同语言，他们的话好似随风刮的果壳。
    马克思列宁主义是推翻不了的，也是沾污不了的。
    社论说，马克思列宁主义是生活的伟大真理，它反映了占世界大多数人口的劳动人民的根本利益，它回答了现代社会发展所提出的最迫切的问题，指出了通向共产主义光辉世界的正确道路。
    我们的时代是马克思列宁主义思想胜利的时代。这个伟大的、永远富有生命力和有现实作用的学说正由各兄弟共产党和工人党在总结当代实际生活的事实、总结苏联和其他社会主义国家建设共产主义和社会主义的经验、国际工人运动和民族解放运动的经验、各国人民争取世界和平的经验的基础上创造性地发展着。
    社论最后说，苏联人民迎接在马克思列宁主义旗帜下获得胜利的十月革命四十一周年的时候，骄傲地回顾他们所经历过的道路。即将举行的苏共第二十一次代表大会将研究1959—1965年苏联国民经济发展的控制数字，这次代表大会将在苏联人民面前展开一个向共产主义迈进的新的前景。
