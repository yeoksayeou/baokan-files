Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, November 18th: Encouraged by the Party's attention and care for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), TCM practitioners in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region are showing great enthusiasm, actively offering advice and treasures. Recently, they contributed over 700 single prescriptions, effective remedies, and family-inherited secret formulas for treating various diseases.

Doctor Zhu Rufan contributed an effective remedy for hyperemesis gravidarum. Women generally experience symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, loss of appetite, and vomiting during the first 40 days to three months of pregnancy. The remedy offered by Doctor Zhu Rufan can treat this condition, with mild cases requiring only one dose and severe cases requiring three doses, allowing the symptoms to disappear within a week. It has no side effects, and the efficacy rate is above 80%.

Guo Songshan, a famous acupuncture physician in Yinchuan City, contributed acupuncture treatment methods for infantile paralysis. Many children develop paralysis of the limbs or the whole body after a high fever. Western medicine is generally helpless for this condition. However, Doctor Guo Songshan has cured many such cases with acupuncture. Guo Songshan also provided a method for treating carbon monoxide poisoning. As long as there is still a breath left after poisoning, acupuncture treatment can still have miraculous effects.

In the general impression, appendicitis requires surgery. However, TCM can treat appendicitis without surgery. TCM practitioners have contributed several effective remedies in this regard. On the afternoon of October 6th this year, a patient with acute appendicitis was sent to Yinchuan People's Hospital. Doctor Zhu Rufan mainly treated the patient with TCM, with a small amount of penicillin used as auxiliary treatment by Western medicine. The patient's temperature decreased and abdominal pain lessened that evening; after another two days, the patient's temperature returned to normal, the abdominal pain disappeared, and the inflammation also subsided.

Huang Zhemin, a TCM practitioner in Zhongwei County, contributed an effective remedy for asthma. A patient who had suffered from asthma for thirteen years stopped wheezing after taking one dose of TCM prescribed by Huang Zhemin and was completely cured after ten doses, without recurrence. Another patient who had been plagued by asthma for seventeen years also responded effectively after only three doses of medication.

Xu Dianjun, a TCM practitioner in Yongning County, dedicated a book containing fifteen years of clinical experience and effective remedies. This handwritten book of remedies introduces forty prescriptions for treating twenty-three kinds of diseases, including the preparation and administration methods of drugs, reactions, case studies, and analysis of drug properties.

TCM practitioners also expressed their willingness to cultivate a large number of TCM talents through apprenticeship.

The Yinchuan City TCM Hospital in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has also been officially established recently.

    让祖国医学广泛为患者服务
    宁夏中医纷纷献计献宝
    新华社银川18日电　在党对祖国医学的重视和关怀的鼓舞下，宁夏回族自治区的中医，人人热情高涨，纷纷献计献宝，最近共献出了治疗各种病症的单方、验方和祖传秘方七百多件。
    朱汝藩大夫献出了妊娠恶阻症的治疗验方。妇女在怀孕四十天至三个月期间，一般都有头晕疲乏、食欲不振和呕吐等症状，用朱汝藩大夫献出的验方治这种病，轻者一剂，重者三剂，就可以使病症在一星期内消失。没有副作用，疗效在80％以上。
    银川市著名的针灸医师郭松山献出了小儿瘫痪的针灸治疗方法。有很多小孩在发高烧之后，会发生四肢或全身瘫痪现象。西医对这种病症一般是束手无策。郭松山医师却用针灸治愈了很多这种病例。郭松山还提供了治疗煤气中毒的办法，中毒后只要还有一口气，用针灸治疗仍有奇效。
    在一般人的印象里，患了阑尾炎，一定要开刀。但是中医治阑尾炎可以不用开刀。中医们在这方面献出了好几个验方。今年10月6日下午，一个急性阑尾炎患者被送到银川市人民医院，由朱汝藩大夫用中药主治，并由西医用少量青霉素作为辅助治疗。当天晚上患者体温下降，腹疼减轻；又经过两天，病人体温恢复正常，腹部不痛了，炎症也消失了。
    中卫县中医黄哲民献出了治疗哮喘症的验方。一个患哮喘十三年的病人，经黄哲民用中药治疗，一剂就停止气喘，十剂全愈，并未复发。另一个被哮喘纠缠了十七年的患者，只服药三剂也即奏效。
    永宁县中医徐殿君把十五年的临床验方写成一本书献出来。这本手抄验方里，介绍了治疗二十三种疾病的四十个处方，其中还包括药物的制法、服法、反应以及病例调查和药物性能的分析等。
    中医们还表示愿意用带徒弟的办法大量培养中医人才。
    宁夏回族自治区银川市中医医院最近也已正式成立。
