    More Reports on the Experience of Collective Boarding in Elementary Schools
    Your newspaper's November 1st news report and short commentary on the implementation of a full supply system for food and lodging in Fan County, Shandong elementary schools explicitly emphasized the importance of social education for children. The experience of Fan County is excellent. The capital and other regions must also be actively preparing to implement collective food and lodging for elementary school students. We hope you will continue to report on the experiences and advantages in this regard to promote the early implementation of this system everywhere.

    多报道小学集体食宿的经验
    11月1日你报关于山东范县小学食宿全部实行供给制的新闻和短评，明确提出对小孩子要强调社会教育，范县的经验好得很。首都和各地一定也在积极准备实行小学生集体食宿，希望你们继续报道这方面的经验和优点，推动各地早日实行。
