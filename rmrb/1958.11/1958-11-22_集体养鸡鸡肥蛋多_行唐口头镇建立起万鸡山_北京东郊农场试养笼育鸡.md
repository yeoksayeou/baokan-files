Collective Chicken Raising Leads to Fat Chickens and More Eggs
    Hsing-tang's K'ou-t'ou Township Establishes a "Ten Thousand Chicken Mountain"
    Beijing Eastern Suburbs Farm Trials Cage-Raising Chickens
    (By Our Staff Reporter) Hsing-tang County, Hopeh Province. K'ou-t'ou Township implemented collective chicken raising and achieved great results. As of the end of July, the township had built six "Ten Thousand Chicken Mountains." The total number of chickens raised reached 146,000, an average of 5.6 chickens per person in the township, a sevenfold increase compared to the end of last year.
    After the K'ou-t'ou Township Party Committee initially issued a call to greatly develop chicken raising, many people had misgivings. They believed that raising chickens would damage vegetable gardens and trample crops. The K'ou-t'ou Supply and Marketing Cooperative proposed building a chicken farm on Ao-yü Mountain. Some people did not believe it, saying, "Ao-yü Mountain is barren and wild animals often appear there. How can we raise chickens in large numbers?" However, under the correct leadership of the Party, after in-depth publicity and mobilization, and after analyzing the favorable conditions and benefits of collective raising on the mountain for the masses, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative first built a "Ten Thousand Chicken Mountain." This broke the superstition that chickens could not be raised on barren mountains and boosted the confidence of the masses in collective chicken raising. Immediately afterward, nearby agricultural cooperatives such as Chicken Skin Village, Ts'ai Village, and Divine Tree also quickly established "Ten Thousand Chicken Mountains." Currently, collective raising chickens on the mountains has become a trend in this area, and the number of chickens raised is constantly and rapidly increasing.
    In order to prevent chicken plague, the breeders also created a relatively complete set of hygiene, epidemic prevention, and feeding management experiences based on "one sufficiency," "two isolations," "three diligences," "four maintenances," and "five cleanlinesses." "One sufficiency" means sufficient feed nutrition; "two isolations" means separating sick chickens from healthy chickens, and large chickens from small chickens; "three diligences" means diligently removing manure, diligently changing water, and diligently turning over the exercise yard; "four maintenances" means maintaining sufficient sunlight, maintaining dry chicken coops, maintaining clean drinking water, and maintaining fresh feed; "five cleanlinesses" means clean chicken coop floors, clean chicken nests and chicken frames, clean chicken troughs, clean waterers, and clean tools.
    Also, Beijing Eastern Suburbs Farm workers learned from the Soviet Union's "cage-raising" method of raising chickens, and now have successfully trialed it. They began raising chickens in March this year and have now developed to more than 20,000 chickens, and some of the chickens have begun to lay eggs. The successful trial of "cage-raised chickens" has opened up broad avenues for the large-scale development of collective chicken raising in our country.
    "Cage-raised chickens" involves raising chicks and meat-egg dual-purpose adult chickens in cages, according to their growth stages. The feeding process is divided into three stages: the first is the chick cage-raising stage. Chicks are raised in bamboo or wooden cages that are 80 cm long, 50 cm wide, and 30 cm high. Each cage holds an average of 24 chicks. The bottom of the cage is mesh, so that the chicks' feces can fall down at any time. On one side of the chicken cage, there are several squares where the chickens can stick their heads out. Feed troughs are placed outside the cage so that the chickens can stick their heads out to eat. The brooding stage lasts for 60 days. The second stage is the free-range feeding stage. As long as the feeding is normal, egg production can begin after the free-range period ends. By the third stage, these chickens have grown into adult chickens. Each adult chicken can lay 180 eggs a year, and when the chickens stop laying eggs and are molting, they can be sold as meat chickens.
    "Cage-raised chickens" have many benefits: they can be hatched and raised year-round, making it easier to solve the supply of poultry and eggs in a planned way; they can greatly increase the utilization rate of chicken coops and increase the management quota of breeders; and they can reduce the incidence of disease in chicks and avoid trampling crops and pecking at seedlings.

    集体养鸡鸡肥蛋多
    行唐口头镇建立起万鸡山
    北京东郊农场试养笼育鸡
    本报讯　河北省行唐县口头镇实行集体养鸡，获得了很大的成绩。截至7月底全镇已建成了六个“万鸡山”，养鸡总数已经达到十四万六千只，全镇每人平均养五点六只，比去年底全镇养鸡数量增加了七倍。
    口头镇党委开始提出大量发展养鸡的号召以后，不少群众思想是有顾虑的。认为养鸡会糟踏菜园、践踏庄稼。口头供销社提出要在鳌鱼山上修建养鸡场。有的群众不相信说：“鳌鱼山是荒山，经常有野兽出没，怎能大量养鸡？”但在党的正确领导下，经过深入宣传动员，向群众分析了山上集体饲养的有利条件与好处以后，供销社首先建成了一个“万鸡山”，这样才打破了荒山不能养鸡的迷信，提高了群众集体养鸡的信心。紧跟着附近的鸡皮寨、蔡庄、神树等农业社也迅速建立了“万鸡山”，目前这一带上山集体养鸡已成风气，养鸡数量正不断迅速上升。
    为了预防鸡瘟，饲养人员还创造了“一足”“二隔离”“三勤”“四保持”“五干净”的一套比较完整的卫生防疫和饲养管理的经验。“一足”即饲料营养足；“二隔离”即有病和无病的分开，大鸡和小鸡分开；“三勤”即勤除粪便，勤换水，勤翻运动场；“四保持”即保持阳光充足，保持鸡舍干燥，保持饮水清洁，保持饲料新鲜；“五干净”即鸡舍地干净，鸡窝鸡架干净，鸡食槽干净，饮水器干净，使用工具干净。
    又讯　北京市东郊农场职工学习苏联用“笼育”方法养鸡，现在已经试养成功。从今年3月开始养鸡，目前已经发展到两万多只，并且有一部分鸡开始生蛋。“笼育鸡”试养的成功为我国大量发展集体养鸡事业开辟了广阔的途径。
    “笼育鸡”是根据鸡的生长情况，把雏鸡和肉蛋兼用的成鸡放笼内饲养。饲养过程分为三个阶段：第一是雏鸡笼育阶段。把雏鸡放在长八十公分，宽五十公分，高三十公分的竹笼或木笼内饲养。每笼平均容纳二十四只。笼底为网状，以便雏鸡的粪便随时漏下。鸡笼的一侧有若干个可以伸出鸡头的方格，笼外放饲料槽，使鸡伸出头吃食。育雏阶段为六十天。第二阶段是放牧饲养阶段，只要饲养正常，放牧结束即可产蛋。到第三个阶段，这些鸡就长成为成鸡了。每只成鸡一年可产蛋一百八十个，当鸡停蛋换毛季节，就可以作为肉鸡出售。
    “笼育鸡”的好处很多：可以常年孵化，常年饲养，更加便于有计划地解决禽、蛋供应问题；可以大大提高鸡舍利用率，提高饲养员的管理定额；可以降低雏鸡发病率和避免践踏庄稼，啄食幼苗。（附图片）
