    Soviet Pakhtakor Football Team's First Match in Beijing
    A 1-1 Draw with Our August 1st Team

    (Our Newspaper) News: The Soviet Tashkent Pakhtakor football team, currently visiting our country, played its first match in China yesterday against our "August 1st" team at the Beijing Xian Nong Tan Stadium. The result was a 1-1 draw.

    In this match, the two sides were evenly matched. The first half ended with no goals, finishing 0-0. In the fourth minute of the second half, "August 1st" team's right inside forward, Ha Zengguang, received a pass from Ren Bin, dribbled past the opponent's defender, and went one-on-one with the goalkeeper. The visiting team's goalkeeper, Shemen, came out to save, but Ha Zengguang pushed the ball into the empty net. To recover from the setback, the visiting team strengthened its attack. In the 34th minute, their left inside forward took a long shot from the edge of the penalty area towards the "August 1st" team's goal. The "August 1st" goalkeeper, Huang Zhaowen, was caught off guard, and although he jumped, the ball still went over his head and into the goal. The visiting team leveled the score. This score remained until the end of the match.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi watched the game. Also in attendance were Soviet Embassy in China Counselor Sudarikov and Velishagin. During the match break, Vice Premier Chen Yi met with the leader of the Pakhtakor football team, Muhammadov, and the leader of the Uzbek weightlifting team, Ukhtan Bek-Jimirnov, who was visiting Beijing to watch the game.

    Before the start of the match, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Football Association, Zhang Zhihuai, and the leader of the Tashkent Pakhtakor team, Muhammadov, both spoke. Zhang Zhihuai said that the visit of the Tashkent Pakhtakor team will play a positive role in strengthening the friendship between the people and athletes of China and the Soviet Union, and in improving the level of football in China. Muhammadov wished Chinese football and sports to reach the world's advanced level in a short period of time.

    苏棉农足球队在京首次比赛
    一比一同我八一队踢平
    本报讯　来我国访问的苏联塔什干棉农足球队，昨天在北京先农坛体育场同我国“八一”队作来华首场比赛，结果一比一握手言和。
    这场比赛，双方势均力敌。前半时都无建树，以零比零结束。下半场四分钟时，“八一”队右内锋哈增光接得任彬传球，晃过对方后卫，单刀直入，客队守门员舍门出救，哈增光将球拨入空门。客队为挽回败局，也加强了攻势，直到第三十四分钟时，左内锋在禁区处一支冷箭，射向“八一”队球门。“八一”守门员黄肇文猝不及防，虽然跃起，球还是从他头上落入球门。客队扳成一平。这个比数一直维持到终场。
    陈毅副总理观看了这场球赛。前来观看球赛的还有苏联驻华大使馆参赞苏达利柯夫和维利夏金。陈毅副总理在比赛休息时接见了棉农足球队领队穆哈默德夫和正在北京访问并观看球赛的乌兹别克举重队领队乌克坦·别克吉米尔诺夫。
    在比赛开始以前，中国足球协会副主席张之槐和塔什干棉农队领队穆哈默德夫都讲了话。张之槐说，塔什干棉农队来访，对加强中苏两国人民和运动员之间的友谊和提高中国足球运动水平将起积极作用。穆哈默德夫祝中国足球运动和体育运动在短期内跃居世界先进水平。
