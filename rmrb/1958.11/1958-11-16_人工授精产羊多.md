Artificial Insemination Produces More Lambs

    (Our report) In 1957, a single ram could generally inseminate only 200 ewes using artificial insemination. The highest number was 1,701 ewes, and only four rams nationwide could inseminate more than 1,000 ewes. In 1958, thanks to the masses breaking superstitions, daring to think and act, and advancing towards science and technology, the technical level of artificial insemination greatly improved, and high-yield "satellites" emerged in sheep artificial insemination as well. At the Liunv Artificial Insemination Station in Weichang County, Hebei Province, one ram inseminated 4,120 ewes; in Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County, Gansu Province, one ram inseminated 5,327 ewes. Particularly outstanding is the artificial insemination station led by Li Shumei, a young woman in Zhangbei County, Hebei Province. By November 6th, they had used a single Merino ram imported from the Soviet Union to inseminate 10,320 ewes, a twenty-fold increase compared to last year. Such a high-yield record is rare in the world.

    人工授精产羊多
    本报讯　一只种公羊用人工授精方法交配母羊的头数，1957年一般只有二百只，最高的是一千七百零一只，全国配到一千只以上的只有四只种公羊。1958年由于广大群众破除迷信，敢想敢做，向科学技术进军，人工授精技术水平大大提高，在羊的人工授精上也出现高产“卫星”。河北省围场县六女人工授精站一只种公羊配母羊四千一百二十只；甘肃省天祝藏族自治县一只种公羊，配母羊五千三百二十七只。特别突出的是：河北省张北县女青年李淑梅领导的人工授精站，到11月6日用一只由苏联引进的美利奴种羊，交配母羊达到一万零三百二十只，比去年提高了二十倍。这样的高产纪录，在世界上是少有的。
