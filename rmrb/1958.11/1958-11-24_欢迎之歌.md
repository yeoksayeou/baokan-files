    Song of Welcome
    Xiao San
    The General rides a thousand-mile horse
    Coming to visit the New China
    Six hundred million people are overjoyed
    Singing and dancing to welcome him
    The General's great name is Kim Il-sung
    Known all over the world
    He led the Korean People's Army
    And defeated the evil American soldiers
    Protecting the three thousand miles of rivers and mountains
    Extinguishing the flames of war in the Far East
    Exposing the American imperialists as paper tigers
    The Korean people have performed a great service
    China and Korea have been good neighbors since ancient times
    The Changbai Mountains and Yalu River are closely related
    Resisting America and aiding Korea to protect our homes and country
    Giving rise to the most beloved people
    The Volunteer Army and the People's Army
    Koreans and Chinese
    Are intimately close without any gaps
    Living together like one family
    Blood cements a solid friendship
    An evergreen song of unity
    For the day of returning in peace
    People cried, unable to part
    This scene and this emotion are deeply moving
    A message to our sisters and brothers
    You and I will forever hold hands
    You and I will forever be heart to heart
    Deep friendship becomes poetry
    Art magnificently reappears
    The clear songs and beautiful dances are extremely captivating
    Please take a close look at "Meeting on the High Ground" (note)
    Welcome, welcome General Kim
    Welcome, welcome all distinguished guests
    Welcome you to ride the thousand-mile horse
    Welcome you to see our drive
    We and you—
    Are heading towards a common goal
    We and you—
    Are standing in a great camp
    The paper tiger is still baring its fangs and brandishing its claws
    We must eliminate the common enemy
    We deeply know
    We firmly believe
    Chinese—Koreans
    Are of one heart for thousands of generations

    (Note) "Meeting on the High Ground" is a program performed by the Korean Art Troupe this time, depicting the scene of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers meeting to resist America together.

    戳穿了美帝纸老虎
    朝鲜人民立下一大功
    中朝自古称善邻
    白山绿水长相亲
    抗美援朝保家国
    出现最可爱的人
    志愿军和人民军
    朝鲜人和中国人
    亲亲密密无间隙
    相处如同一家人
    鲜血凝结友谊固
    万古常青同心曲
    为了和平归来日
    难舍难分人尽哭
    此景此情感人深
    寄语姐妹与弟兄
    我你永远手携手    
    我你永远心连心
    深情厚谊成诗篇
    艺术壮丽得再现
    清歌妙舞迷人甚
    “高地相逢”请细看（注）
    欢迎，欢迎金将军
    欢迎，欢迎众贵宾
    欢迎你们骑上千里马
    欢迎你们看看咱干劲
    我们和你们——
    奔赴一个共同的目的
    我们和你们——
    站在一个伟大的阵营
    纸老虎还在张牙又舞爪
    我们要消灭共同的敌人
    我们深知
    我们深信
    中国人——朝鲜人
    千秋万代一条心
    （注）“在高地相逢”是此次朝鲜艺术团演出的一个节目，表现朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军会合共同抗美情景。
