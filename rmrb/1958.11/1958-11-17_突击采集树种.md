Intensive Collection of Tree Seeds

To carry out a large-scale afforestation movement, the first problem to solve is the seed issue. This winter and next year, the country will afforest over 800 million mu, requiring more than 1.8 billion jin of seeds. Therefore, collecting enough seeds is the first condition to ensure the smooth development of the afforestation movement this winter and next year.

Collecting more than 1.8 billion jin of seeds in a relatively short period is an arduous task; however, we have ample conditions to ensure its completion. Since Chairman Mao put forward the call to realize the "gardenization" of the whole country, the people have been inspired by this beautiful communist ideal, and their enthusiasm for planting trees and afforestation has become even higher. Collecting more seeds, planting more trees, and planting good trees have become universal demands; and China's forest seed resources are very rich, and this year is a fruitful harvest year for most forest trees. Therefore, as long as the masses are mobilized to launch one or several nationwide intensive seed collection campaigns, the needs can be met. The Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture in Guizhou Province has launched a mass seed collection campaign. Since the end of October, about 160,000 people have participated every day. In just a few days, more than 7.5 million jin of seeds have been collected, accounting for 74.8% of the planned amount.

However, judging from the seed collection situation in various places, the current progress is still very slow. In many areas, seed collection work has not yet formed a mass movement. As of November 6, statistics show that only more than 400 million jin of seeds have been collected nationwide, accounting for 22% of the seed collection plan. If this situation is not changed immediately, and the seed collection season is missed, the seed collection plan cannot be completed, and the afforestation task for next year will be in danger of not being completed. In the afforestation movement in the first half of this year, some areas, although the masses were very enthusiastic about afforestation, failed to complete the afforestation plan due to insufficient preparation of seeds and seedlings. Therefore, grasping the seed collection work firmly has become an urgent task for party and government leaders in various places.

The main reason why the seed collection work has not made much progress at present is that in the case of tight rural labor, the seed collection work has been squeezed out, or has not been put on the agenda at all. So, is it impossible to complete the seed collection task due to tight labor? No. Experience in various places has proved that collecting tree seeds does not require full-time labor, and seed collection work can be combined with various productions. Therefore, as long as the leadership makes arrangements, the seed collection task can not only be completed but can also be overfulfilled. After criticizing the right-leaning conservative thinking of "there is no time to collect seeds due to tight labor" and "greening is almost done," Zhenyuan County in Guizhou Province adopted the method of "three moves" and "four combinations": moving labor to the mountains, moving schools to the mountains, and moving the forestry department's offices to the mountains; combining logging, mining, autumn harvesting, and militia training, a climax of everyone collecting seeds was launched. In this way, they not only ensured the ascendance of steel and grain marshals, but also collected more than 1.88 million jin of seeds in half a month, exceeding the original plan by more than two times. The experience of Zhenyuan County is worth learning from in various places.

In recent years, the masses have created many simple and advanced tools for collecting and processing seeds. Jilin's seed stripping device, Jiangxi's four-toothed cone picking device, Hunan's Song picking knife, Guangdong Maoming's pine cone scraper, Hunan Lingling's simple artificial cone drying room, etc. are all relatively successful new tools. Forestry departments in various places should organize forces to study them, select several with promotional value, and immediately organize promotion.

Now, various forest tree seeds have matured, and some have begun to fall. We must seize the opportunity to carry out an intensive campaign, and the plan to collect tree seeds can be completed.

### 突击采集树种

    突击采集树种
    开展大规模的造林运动，首先要解决种子问题。今冬和明年全国要造林八亿多亩，需要十八亿多斤种子。因此，采集足够种子是保证今冬和明年造林运动顺利开展的第一个条件。
    在一个较短的时间内采集十八亿多斤种子，这是一个艰巨的任务；但是我们有充分的条件可以保证完成。自从毛主席提出实现全国“园林化”的号召以后，人民群众为这个美丽的共产主义的理想所鼓舞，植树造林的积极性更加高涨，多采种、多种树、种好树已成为普遍要求；而我国的林木种子资源十分丰富，今年又是大多数林木结实丰收年，因此，只要把群众发动起来，开展一次或几次全民性的突击采种运动，就可以满足需要。贵州省黔东南苗族、侗族自治州开展了群众性的采种运动，自10月底开始，每天约有十六万人参加，不过几天功夫，已采种七百五十多万斤，为计划数的74.8％。
    可是，从各地采种的情况看来，目前进度还很迟缓。不少地区采种工作还没有形成群众性的运动。截至11月6日统计，全国只采到种子四亿多斤，为采种计划的22％。这种情况如果不立即改变，错过了采种季节，采种计划不能完成，明年的造林任务也就有完不成的危险。在今年上半年的造林运动中，就是由于种子、树苗准备不足，有些地区群众造林积极性虽然很高，但没有完成造林计划。因此，狠狠地抓一抓采种工作，已成为各地党政领导一项当前的急务。
    目前采种工作所以进展不大，主要原因是在农村劳动力紧张的情况下，采种工作被挤掉了，或根本没有提到议事日程上来。那么，劳动力紧张是不是就不可能完成采种任务了呢？不是的。各地经验证明，采集树种不需要整劳动力，而且采种工作可以结合各种生产进行。因此只要领导上加以安排，采种任务不仅可以完成，而且可以超额完成。贵州省镇远县在批判了“劳动力紧张顾不上采种”、“绿化已经差不多了”的右倾保守思想以后，采取“三搬”“四结合”的办法：将劳动力搬上山，学校搬上山，林业部门办公室搬上山；结合采伐木材、挖矿、秋收、民兵训练，掀起了一个人人采种运动的高潮。这样，他们不但保证了钢铁、粮食元帅升帐，而且在半个月的时间内，采种一百八十八万多斤，超过原计划二倍多。镇远县的经验值得各地学习。
    几年来，群众已创造了许多简易的先进的采集和处理种子的工具。吉林的撸种器，江西的四齿球果采摘器，湖南的宋摘刀，广东茂名的松果刨，湖南零陵的简易人工球果干燥烘房等都是比较成功的新工具，各地林业部门应该组织力量加以研究，评选几种有推广价值的，立即组织推广。
    现在，各种林木种子都已成熟，有的已经开始脱落。我们必须抓紧时机进行突击，采集树种的计划是可以完成的。
