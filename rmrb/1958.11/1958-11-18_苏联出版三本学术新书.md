Three New Academic Books Published in the Soviet Union

"Fundamentals of Marxist Philosophy"

    "Fundamentals of Marxist Philosophy," collectively written by the Institute of Philosophy of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and edited by Konstantinov, was published by the Soviet State Political Literature Publishing House in August of this year. The book is divided into three parts and nineteen chapters, totaling approximately 600,000 words. The Chinese translation will be published by the People's Publishing House.

    This book has several notable features. The authors use an introduction, dialectical materialism, and historical materialism to discuss Marxist philosophy as a whole. In the introduction, the authors begin by discussing the object of philosophy, then the fundamental question of philosophy, the relationship between philosophy and other sciences, the struggle between materialism and idealism in the history of philosophy, and the emergence and development of Marxist philosophy. In addition, the authors also discuss the revolutionary role of Marxist philosophy and the significance of the struggle against revisionism.

    In the dialectical materialism section, the authors do not proceed by discussing the four characteristics of dialectics and the three characteristics of materialism, but begin by discussing matter and its forms of existence, then the relationship between matter and consciousness, and the connections between phenomena in reality. The authors further discuss the basic laws of dialectics and point out that the negation of the negation is one of the three basic laws of dialectics. In addition, the authors also discuss the dialectics of the cognitive process.

    The historical materialism section accounts for half of the book. In this section, the authors cite newer materials and examples, and critically introduce several major schools of modern bourgeois philosophy and sociology in a dedicated chapter.

"Concise Dictionary of Economics"

    The Soviet State Political Literature Publishing House published a "Concise Dictionary of Economics" in June of this year, edited by Kozlov and Pilshchulin. The Chinese translation will be published by the People's Publishing House within the year.

    This dictionary offers new explanations for many terms. For example, the dictionary's explanation of "productive forces" is: "Productive forces are the means of labor and people with productive experience, labor skills, and the ability to use these materials to produce material goods." The dictionary does not have an entry for "basic economic law of modern capitalism," but it mentions in the entry for "basic economic law of capitalism" that in the era of imperialism, the law of surplus value has been further developed. In the entry on "the interrelationship between relations of production and productive forces," it does not mention "relations of production must conform to the nature of productive forces," but mentions "relations of production conform to the nature of productive forces."

"Political Dictionary"

    The "Political Dictionary" (second edition), edited by Ponomarev, has been published by the Soviet State Political Literature Publishing House. The book contains approximately two thousand entries of political terms and terminology, and an index of major entries is attached to the end of the book. The index is divided into ten categories: the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, countries and territories around the world, the international workers' and democratic movements, international relations, political economy and national economy, philosophy, religion and atheistic propaganda, law, and world history.

    The editing of this dictionary was completed in January of this year, and therefore, some major events that occurred later, such as the establishment of the United Arab Republic and the Iraqi Revolution, were not included. However, due to its rich materials and detailed explanations, it is still a valuable reference book.

### 苏联出版三本学术新书

    苏联出版三本学术新书
    “马克思主义哲学基础”
    苏联科学院哲学研究所集体编写、康斯坦丁诺夫主编的“马克思主义哲学基础”一书，已由苏联国家政治书籍出版局在今年8月出版。全书共分三部分、十九章，约六十万字。中文译本将由人民出版社出版。
    这本书具有不少的特点。作者用导言、辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义三个部分，把马克思主义哲学作为一个整体加以论述。在导言部分中，作者从论述哲学的对象问题开始，然后论述了哲学根本问题、哲学同其他科学的关系、哲学史上唯物主义同唯心主义的斗争以及马克思主义哲学的产生和发展。此外，作者还对马克思主义哲学的革命作用以及反对修正主义斗争的意义作了论述。
    在辩证唯物主义部分中，作者不是按照论述辩证法的四个特征和唯物主义的三个特征的次序进行论述，而是从论述物质及其存在的形式开始，然后论述了物质同意识的关系以及现实中现象之间的联系问题。作者进一步地论述了辩证法的基本规律，并且指出了否定的否定是辩证法的三个基本规律之一。此外，作者还论述了认识过程的辩证法。
    历史唯物主义部分占这本书的一半篇幅。在这一部分中，作者引用了较新的材料和实例，并且用一个专章批判地介绍了现代资产阶级哲学和社会学的几个主要派别。
    “简明经济学辞典”
    苏联国家政治书籍出版局在今年6月出版了一部“简明经济学辞典”，主编者是科兹洛夫和彼尔叔申。中文译本将由人民出版社在年内出版。
    这部辞典对许多名词作了新的解释。例如，辞典里对“生产力”的解释是：“生产力是劳动资料和具有生产经验、劳动技能、运用这些资料来生产物质资料的人。”辞典里没有“现代资本主义基本经济规律”这一条，但是，在“资本主义基本经济规律”这一条里提到：在帝国主义时代，剩余价值律获得了进一步的发展。在关于“生产关系和生产力的相互关系”的条目中，不提“生产关系一定要适合生产力的性质”，而提“生产关系适合生产力的性质”。
    “政治辞典”
    波诺玛列夫主编的“政治辞典”（第二版），已由苏联国家政治书籍出版局出版。全书约有两千条政治名词和术语的条目，书末还附有主要条目的分类索引。索引分十类，计为：苏联共产党，世界各国和疆域，国际工人运动和民主运动，国际关系，政治经济学和国民经济，哲学，宗教和无神论宣传，法律，世界通史。
    这部辞典的编辑工作系于今年1月完成，因此，后来发生的一些重大事件，如阿拉伯联合共和国的成立、伊拉克革命等，未及列入。但由于取材丰富，解释详细，它仍不失为一本有价值的工具书。
