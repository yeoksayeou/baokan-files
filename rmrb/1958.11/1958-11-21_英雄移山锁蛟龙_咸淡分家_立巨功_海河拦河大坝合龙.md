Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 19th. The Haihe River dam successfully closed on the morning of the 18th; the fishing boat lock, one of the Haihe River gate hub projects, opened and released water on the same day, and the concrete pouring project of the control gate was also completed.

The closure of the dam marks that the Haihe River, the largest river in North China, has obediently entered a new historical period. This dam cuts off the natural connection between the Haihe River and the Bohai Sea, preventing the fresh water injected into the Haihe River from the five inland rivers of North China from flowing into the sea, and preventing the salt-containing seawater from flowing upstream into the river, achieving the goal of "separating salt and fresh water" in the Haihe River. In this way, the Haihe River has become a large river reservoir, which can better serve industrial and agricultural production according to people's wishes.

The dam is one of the main projects of the Haihe River gate construction. The dam is 300 meters long, 13 meters high, 260 meters wide at the bottom, and 10 meters wide at the top. It requires more than 6,000 piles of firewood and stones and more than 90,000 cubic meters of earth filling. The scale and difficulty of the construction are rare in the history of Tianjin's construction projects. The construction of such a dam generally takes about half a year, but the tens of thousands of laborers fighting on the Haihe River construction site showed the soaring enthusiasm to make the mountains bow their heads and the rivers give way, and successfully completed the task in only forty-four days and nights.

At 10:30 a.m. on the 18th, when the dam closed, the two red flags on the dam head were inserted together, with the words "Heroes Meet, Lock the Dragon, Transform the Haihe River, and Make Great Contributions" written on the flags. At this time, the boiling cheers, thunderous firecrackers, and the songs from the artists in the loudspeakers converged into a symphony of victory on the construction site. In the afternoon of the same day, the laborers of the Haihe River gate construction site held a victory celebration meeting in Xingang to celebrate the closure of the dam, the release of water from the fishing boat lock, and the completion of the concrete pouring project of the control gate. Li Gengtao, Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of Tianjin, said at the meeting: What we are doing now to transform the Haihe River is a major event that should be written in history. This not only brings happiness to the people of the city today, but also creates happiness for future generations. He pointed out that although the entire project has achieved great success, it has not been fully completed. There is still much work to be done in front of us. He hoped that all laborers must guard against arrogance and impetuosity, overcome the difficulties of the final stage without slackening, and strive for the complete victory of the entire project.

### 英雄移山锁蛟龙  “咸淡分家”立巨功  海河拦河大坝合龙

    英雄移山锁蛟龙  “咸淡分家”立巨功
    海河拦河大坝合龙
    新华社天津19日电　海河拦河大坝18日上午胜利合龙；海河建闸枢纽工程之一的渔船闸，在同日开闸放水，节制闸的混凝土浇筑工程也全部完工。
    拦河大坝的合龙，标志着华北最大的河流——海河，驯服地进入了一个新的历史时期。这条大坝切断了海河同渤海之间的天然联系，使华北五条内河注入海河的淡水不再流入大海，并且使含有盐分的海水不再上溯河内，实现了海河河水“咸淡分家”的目的。这样海河便成了大型的河道水库，更能按照人们的意愿为工农业生产服务。
    拦河大坝是海河建闸主体工程之一，坝长三百公尺、高十三公尺，底宽二百六十多公尺、顶宽十公尺，需要抛柴石枕六千多个，填土九万多立方；其规模之大、施工之艰巨，是天津市建筑工程史上少有的。修建这样的拦河坝，一般要半年左右的时间，但是战斗在海河工地上的数万名劳动大军，拿出了让高山低头、河水让路的冲天干劲，仅仅用了四十四个昼夜的时间就胜利地完成了任务。
    18日上午十时三十分拦河坝合龙的时候，坝头上的两面红旗插到一起，旗上写着“英雄会师，锁住蛟龙，改造海河，立下巨功”。这时，沸腾的欢呼声，雷鸣般的鞭炮声，艺术家们在扩音器里传出的歌声，在工地上汇成了胜利的交响曲。当天下午，海河建闸工地的劳动者在新港举行祝捷大会，庆祝拦河坝合龙、渔船闸放水、节制闸混凝土浇筑工程完工。中共天津市委书记、天津市市长李耕涛在会上说：我们现在做的改造海河的事情是一件应该写在历史上的大事情。这不仅为今天的全市人民带来了幸福，而且给子孙万代创造了幸福。他指出，整个工程虽然取得了很大成绩，但是还没有全部完工。在我们的面前还有许多工作要做。他希望全体劳动者必须戒骄戒躁，毫不松劲地克服最后阶段的困难，力争整个工程全胜。
