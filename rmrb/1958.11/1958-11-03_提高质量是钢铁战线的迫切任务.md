    Improving Quality is an Urgent Task for the Steel Front

    In October, the steel front achieved an even greater victory than in the previous two months, with steel production reaching 1,877,700 tons, an increase of 91.7% compared to September, and iron production reaching 8,716,600 tons, exceeding September's output by 457%. This achievement once again proclaimed the victory of launching mass movements in industry, especially the victory of implementing the "small indigenous groups" approach in the steel industry. If, in the previous two months, some people had doubts about completing the task of producing 10.7 million tons of steel, now these people cannot doubt the soaring growth of steel production. It is now entirely possible to achieve the goal of doubling steel production this year ahead of schedule. If, in the previous two months, some people held a skeptical attitude towards the policy of launching mass movements in industrial departments and the "small indigenous groups" approach, now these people cannot help but be convinced by the power displayed by mass movements and the "small indigenous groups" approach. Now, everyone can clearly see that launching mass movements and walking on two legs—large modern groups and small indigenous groups—indeed produces a high speed that is difficult for people to anticipate.

    So, are there no problems on the steel front? Can we rest easy by maintaining the status quo? Of course not. The quantity of steel has been basically resolved, but the quality issue has not been completely resolved, especially the quality of indigenous iron. Currently, there are some other problems on the steel front, but the quality issue is relatively prominent and needs to be addressed urgently. During this period, much of the pig iron smelted by various provinces still has a high phosphorus and sulfur content, which poses certain difficulties for supplying modern steel furnaces. Some of it is sintered iron, which cannot be directly used for steelmaking or casting. At present, the pig iron smelted by our modern blast furnaces is far from meeting the needs of steelmaking, and about three-quarters or more of the steel must be smelted from indigenous iron. Therefore, improving the quality of indigenous iron, striving to increase the proportion of first-class iron, reducing the proportion of second-class iron, and striving to eliminate sintered iron have become extremely urgent issues. If the quality of indigenous iron is not improved, it will affect the growth of steel production. If we only pursue quantity and ignore quality, the result will hinder the completion of the steel production task. Therefore, any idea that underestimates the seriousness of the quality problem is very harmful and must be criticized and corrected.

    However, it is also unnecessary to be alarmed or even pessimistic about the poor quality of pig iron. It is not surprising that the pig iron produced by some indigenous blast furnaces is of poor quality during this period. Because tens of thousands of small blast furnaces have been set up mostly within the last two months, and the people who built these small blast furnaces are almost all farmers who have never smelted iron before. Therefore, it is completely understandable that some technical problems cannot be solved or are not solved well in time, which affects the quality of some pig iron. It would be strange if there were no difficulties or problems at all when the masses started making steel.

    Now, some people have been rendered speechless by the power of the "small indigenous groups" approach in terms of quantity and speed. However, they are not completely convinced of the "small indigenous groups" approach. They say that the poor quality of indigenous iron, which cannot be used for steelmaking, is an inherent defect of the "small indigenous groups" and cannot be changed. Our view is completely opposite to these skeptics. We believe that it is difficult to avoid relatively low quality at the beginning when the masses are making steel on a large scale; however, it is wrong to think that the quality of "small indigenous groups" must be poor and cannot be improved. Quantity and quality are dialectical relationships; without quantity, there is no quality, and with quantity, there can be quality. The quality of any development gradually rises from low to high, and steel production is certainly no exception. When the Party Central Committee proposed the task of producing 10.7 million tons of steel this year, the national steel production from January to August was only over 4 million tons, still short of over 6 million tons, and only four months were left. At that time, the main contradiction was the insufficient quantity of pig iron, and the whole Party and the whole people had to first concentrate their efforts to solve this main contradiction. Now that the quantity problem of pig iron has been basically solved, at this time, we can and must concentrate our efforts to solve the new main contradiction—the problem of improving the quality of pig iron. In fact, the development of the objective situation is precisely like this, and the masses are doing exactly this. Now, many places have solved the quality problem immediately after solving the quantity problem. For example, the indigenous iron produced in more than 40 counties in Sichuan can be used for steelmaking in the same way as modern iron. The masses have proven with facts that "small indigenous groups" can not only solve the quantity problem but also completely solve the quality problem. The skeptics' "quality cannot be changed" theory is destined to go bankrupt completely.

    Of course, saying that the quality problem of indigenous iron can be solved does not mean that it does not require subjective efforts and will be solved naturally. It is still necessary to give full play to people's subjective initiative and to advance the "small indigenous groups" in the steel industry from the stage of popularization to the stage of improvement. In the previous period, various indigenous furnaces and various smelting methods flourished everywhere. Now, after a period of time, it has become clear which furnace types are superior or inferior, which smelting methods are good or bad, and which resource conditions are good or bad. At this time, we should do the work of stabilizing achievements and further improving, and we need to promptly promote the experience of implementing the "small indigenous groups" approach in the steel industry to other departments. Now, all localities, especially abundant areas, should start to consciously select some key furnace groups in places with relatively abundant iron ore and coal resources. In these "key groups," select good furnace types, establish small iron mines and small coal mines near them, and combine them with the transportation of the "small indigenous groups," organize fixed professional teams for mining, transportation, and smelting, formulate good smelting methods and operating methods into operating procedures, establish necessary management systems, mobilize the masses to improve technology, improve tools and equipment, improve labor efficiency, and, where possible, gradually improve its technical equipment and mechanization level, establish small steel rolling mills and small chemical plants that comprehensively utilize coal, so that these "key groups" gradually develop towards small, indigenous-modern combined steel joint bases. In this way, not only can the quality of pig iron be gradually improved and stabilized, and the output of indigenous iron and indigenous steel can be gradually improved and stabilized, but also the current "small indigenous groups" steel industry can be promoted to a larger scope and a higher level, laying the foundation for the widespread establishment of small heavy industry bases in the vast rural areas.

    From focusing on quantity to focusing on improving quality on the basis of continuing to increase quantity, from trial implementation and popularization of "small indigenous groups" to consolidation and improvement of "small indigenous groups," from exploring the experience of implementing "small indigenous groups" in the steel industry to promoting this experience in more industrial departments, this is the new situation that has emerged after the great victory on the steel front in October and the new tasks that have been put forward to us. We must accomplish this task. And we will definitely be able to accomplish this task.

### 提高质量是钢铁战线的迫切任务

    提高质量是钢铁战线的迫切任务
    10月份，钢铁战线获得了一个比前两个月更大的胜利，钢产量达到一百八十七万七千吨，比9月份增加了91.7％，铁产量达到八百七十一万六千吨，超过9月份产量的457％。这个战绩再一次宣告了在工业中大搞群众运动的胜利，尤其是在钢铁工业中贯彻小土群方针的胜利。如果说，前两个月还有人对完成一千零七十万吨钢的任务没有信心，那么，现在这些人也不能怀疑钢产量的飞跃增长了，提前实现今年钢产量翻一番的目标，现在是完全可能的了。如果说，前两个月还有人对在工业部门中大搞群众运动的方针，对小土群的方针，抱着怀疑的态度，那么，现在这些人也不能不为群众运动、为小土群的方针所显示的威力所说服了。现在，每一个人都可以清楚地看到，大搞群众运动，用大洋群和小土群两条腿走路，果然会产生人所难以预料的高速度。
    那么，是不是在钢铁战线上就没有问题了呢？是不是保持现状就可以高枕无忧了呢？当然不是。现在钢铁的数量问题基本上解决了，但是质量的问题还没有完全解决，特别是土铁的质量问题还没有完全解决。目前，钢铁战线上还存在一些其他的问题，但是质量问题则是比较突出的、需要立即解决的当务之急。这一时期，各省炼出来的生铁，许多还是含磷含硫较高，供给洋炉子炼钢，有一定的困难；还有一些则是烧结铁，不能直接用于炼钢，也不能直接用于铸造。目前我们的现代化高炉炼出来的生铁，远远不能满足炼钢的需要，约有四分之三以上的钢必须用土铁来炼。因此，提高土铁质量，努力提高一类铁的比重，减低二类铁的比重，努力消灭烧结铁，已经成为十分迫切的问题。如果土铁的质量不提高，就将影响到钢产量的增长。如果只追求数量，忽视质量，其结果就会妨害钢的生产任务的完成。因此，任何对质量问题的严重性估计不足的思想，都是十分有害的，都必须批判和纠正。
    但是，对生铁质量不好表示大惊小怪，甚至悲观失望，也是不必要的。这一时期有些土高炉炼出来的生铁质量不好，并不奇怪。因为数以万计的小高炉，绝大部分是在最近两个月内办起来的，建设这些小高炉的人，差不多都是从来没有炼过铁的农民，因而一些技术上的问题一时不能解决或者解决得不好，以致影响到一部分生铁的质量，是完全可以理解的。如果说群众办钢铁在开始的时候没有一点困难，不存在任何问题，那倒是一件奇怪的事情了。
    现在有一些人，对小土群方针在数量上、在速度上所发挥的威力，已经哑口无言了。但是，他们对小土群的方针还没有完全信服。他们说，土铁质量不好，不能炼钢，是小土群的先天性的缺陷，是无法改变的。我们的看法和这些怀疑派完全相反。我们认为，群众大办钢铁，开始一个时期质量比较低，是难以避免的；但是如果认为小土群质量就一定不好，一定不能提高，则是错误的。数量和质量是辩证的关系，没有数量就没有质量，有了数量才能有质量。任何事物的发展，其质量都是由低到高，逐步上升的，钢铁生产当然也不例外。在党中央提出今年生产一千零七十万吨钢这一任务的时候，全国1至8月份的钢产量只有四百多万吨，还差六百多万吨，而时间只剩下了四个月。当时的主要矛盾是生铁的数量不足，全党全民必须首先集中力量来突击解决这个主要矛盾。现在生铁的数量问题基本上解决了，这时候，就可以而且必须集中力量来解决新的主要矛盾——提高生铁质量的问题了。事实上，客观形势的发展正是这样，群众正是这样做的。现在已经有不少地方在解决了数量问题之后，紧跟着也解决了质量问题。例如四川就有四十多县生产的土铁可以和洋铁同样地用来炼钢。群众用事实证明：小土群不仅可以解决数量问题，也完全可以解决质量问题。怀疑派的“质量不可改变”论，注定是要彻底破产的。
    当然，说土铁的质量问题可以解决，并不是说不需要主观的努力，自然而然地就会得到解决。这是还需要发挥人的主观能动性，需要把钢铁工业中的小土群从普及的阶段推进到提高的阶段。在前一时期，各种土炉子，各种冶炼方法，是遍地开花，争芳斗妍。现在，经过了一段时间以后，各种炉型孰优孰劣，冶炼方法孰高孰低，资源条件孰好孰坏，已经看得分明了。在这个时候，就应该做稳定成绩和进一步提高的工作了，而且需要把钢铁工业中实行小土群方针的经验，及时地推广到其它部门中去。现在，各个地方特别是丰产的地区，都应当着手在铁矿和煤炭资源比较充足的地方，有意识地选择一些重点炉群，在这些“重点群”里，选择好的炉型，在它的附近，建立小铁矿、小煤窑，并和小土群的交通运输结合起来，组织固定的采矿、运输、冶炼等专业队伍，把好的冶炼方法、操作方法制订成操作规程，建立必要的管理制度，发动群众改良技术、改良工具和设备，提高劳动效率，并且在可能的条件下，逐步提高它的技术装备和机械化程度，建立小型的轧钢厂和综合利用煤炭的小型化工厂，使这些“重点群”逐步地向着小型的、土洋结合的钢铁联合基地的方向发展。这样，不仅生铁的质量可以逐步提高和稳定，土铁和土钢的产量可以逐步提高和稳定，而且把目前的小土群的钢铁工业推广到更大的范围，提到更高的水平，为在广大农村普遍建立小型的重工业基地打下基础。
    从以突击数量为主进到在继续增加数量的基础上以提高质量为主，从试办和普及小土群进到巩固和提高小土群，从在钢铁工业中摸索实行小土群的经验进到在更多的工业部门中推广这个经验，这就是10月份钢铁战线大捷后出现的新形势和向我们提出的新任务。我们一定要完成这个任务。我们也一定能够完成这个任务。
