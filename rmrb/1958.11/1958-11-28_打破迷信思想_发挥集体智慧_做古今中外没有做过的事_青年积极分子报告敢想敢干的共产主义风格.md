Xinhua News Agency, November 27th: At today's National Congress of Young Socialist Construction Activists, young activists from the industrial and agricultural fronts used their personal experiences to prove the immense correctness of the Party and Chairman Mao's call to break down superstition and liberate thought, and praised the glorious victory of the Communist style of daring to think, speak, and act.

A common 23-year-old railway maintenance worker successfully created a new type of railway turnout that no country in the world has ever had, greatly improving transportation efficiency. This young man who dares to think and act is Wang Yushu, a maintenance worker from the Fengtai Engineering Section of the Beijing Railway Bureau. Today, he reported his deeds to everyone at the meeting in a very encouraging tone.

Wang Yushu, during the Great Leap Forward this year, saw that industrial and agricultural production were developing rapidly, but the efficiency of railway transportation was still very low, especially the turnout problem, which was the biggest obstacle. Whenever trains passed through turnouts, they had to reduce their speed by more than half. He was very anxious about this and was determined to find a way to improve the turnout. During the experiment, he received encouragement and support from the Party branch secretary and finally successfully tested this new type of turnout. This turnout can increase train speed. For example, on the trip from Beijing to Shanghai, each train can shorten travel time by one hour, and the country can increase its wealth by about 60,000 yuan every day. Because this turnout is simple to manufacture and inexpensive, it can also save a lot of steel rails. If all the stations in the country are replaced with this type of turnout, the saved steel rails can be used to lay 500 kilometers of railway, saving 18 million yuan.

To conquer the fortresses of advanced technology, in addition to breaking down superstition, it is also necessary to cooperate with each other and give full play to collective wisdom. Wang Zhongli, a technician at the Xi'an Geophysical Instrument Repair Factory, used the facts of their factory to illustrate this point in his speech.

Wang Zhongli said that after the youth in their factory broke down superstition under the guidance of the Party and generally marched towards advanced technology, an abnormal emotion emerged—going it alone. There are two situations here: a few people are motivated by individual heroism, wanting to show off and unwilling to cooperate with others; more people are afraid of failure and criticism and dare not speak up. He himself had this idea at the time. He started experimenting with radioactive logging instruments last year, but never dared to say it. Some people failed several times without saying a word, and were still doing it quietly alone. This seriously affected the effect of the research. At this time, the leading comrades of the Party committee taught them: "One person's wisdom is ultimately limited, and the role of collective wisdom is greater." At the same time, they criticized those who stood aside and pointed fingers. In this way, the young people's concerns were eliminated, and their confidence was enhanced; many young people immediately changed their single-handed approach, took the initiative to cooperate with others, and worked together to attack advanced technology. As a result of doing so, they invented and created many new products, of which 16 products reached domestic and international advanced levels, and none of them were not the result of giving full play to collective wisdom.

"The working people are the masters of the struggle of production practice, and practice is the foundation of science. Science cannot be monopolized by a few scientists and experts. The ironclad facts prove that those bourgeois experts who despise practice and are divorced from practice are not smart. The working people are a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand times smarter than them. What they can do, we can definitely do; what they cannot do, we can also do." This is a brilliant assertion in the speech of Zhou Hanhua, a young farmer and breeder from Xinhui County, Guangdong Province.

This young farmer has conducted 32 rice variety hybridization experiments in the past three years. Among them, he hybridized rice with sorghum and successfully cultivated six new high-yield varieties. They all have the characteristics of coarse japonica, developed root system, disease resistance, strong lodging resistance, long ears, many grains, and heavy grains. The best ear length is more than nine inches, with an average of more than 300 grains per ear, strong and hard stalks, and they still do not fall over when hit by an 8-grade typhoon during heading, and they are also resistant to rice blast. This year, he also conducted hybridization experiments using sorghum as the female parent and rice as the male parent, and also conducted hybridization experiments with vanilla and rice to cultivate a fragrant variety. These experiments have all been initially successful.

Also speaking at the meeting today were Xu Hengzhun, a representative from the artillery troops on the Fujian front line, and He Danian, a representative from the Xiamen City Front Line Young Pioneer Support Activity Brigade. Xu Hengzhun reported on the victorious battle record of their company in the shelling of Jinmen, entitled "Don't Allow Enemy Artillery to 'Speak'." In the battle, they managed to strike the enemy accurately, ruthlessly, and economically. In less than a month, in addition to fighting alongside fraternal troops, they independently bombed 37 enemy targets 91 times, destroying two enemy combat defense guns, one car, one command post, one observation post, one combat defense gun fortification, and one shelter, completing the tasks assigned to them by their superiors. When Xu Hengzhun said in a firm and powerful voice: "As long as we are here, the enemy artillery will have no 'right to speak'!" "We are ready to fight for the liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu at any time!" The entire audience responded with warm, stormy applause.

This afternoon, the youth representatives of the Army, Navy, and Air Force stationed in Beijing presented gifts to the conference. When more than 500 young soldiers carried and held up large character slogan boards with "Defend the Motherland" and "We Will Surely Liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu" and marched into the conference hall with majestic and orderly steps, all the young activists stood up and applauded warmly to express their gratitude to the strong defenders of socialist construction. The young soldiers who presented the gifts today brought the wreckage of a Chiang Kai-shek military plane shot down by the air force soldiers on the Fujian front line, models of airplanes, artillery, and warships designed and manufactured by themselves, as well as charts, models, and physical objects showing their great achievements in building a modern national defense army and supporting steel and agricultural production, and presented them to the conference. In their congratulatory message to the conference, the youth representatives of the three armed forces expressed their determination to learn from the example of young activists and make greater contributions in defending and building the socialist motherland.

The conference today was filled with youthful joy. Some young activists could not restrain their inner joy and excitement when they spoke, and they all excitedly opened their throats and sang. The famous textile worker Huang Baomei, at the end of reading the joint speech of her and 13 other textile workers, sang a poem praising the Great Leap Forward of textile workers in the Yue opera tune. Gao Xinfu, the "Living Wu Song" from Jingyanggang, inserted two sections of Shandong's unique "Wu Lao Er" fast talk in his speech, praising the great harvest of their Shouzhang County Jingyanggang "Wu Song" production team. The last speaker was Yin Guanglan, a female peasant singer from Anhui Province who had lived a painful life as a child bride for 20 years. She sang loudly in her speech, saying: I will sing so that everyone strives to be upstream, and sing so that red flags flutter everywhere. These songs symbolizing light and happiness lingered in the entire venue for a long time.

A total of 21 people spoke at the conference today, including Du Jimin, a young engineer from Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant in Shanxi, Hong Bangjun (joint speech), a young representative from Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant, Boiler Plant, and Turbine Plant, Li Xiaoquan, furnace chief of the rocket copper smelting furnace at Xintang Mine in Dongchuan, Yunnan, Zhang Yupu, representative of Youth High Furnace No. 1 of Benxi Iron and Steel Plant, Chen Yuman, director of "May Fourth" Iron and Steel Plant in Macheng County, Hubei, Yang Caixia, worker of Northwest State Cotton Factory No. 5, Hu Baoyu, secretary of the Communist Youth League Shiliu County Committee in Shanxi Province, Tian Jiayi, secretary of the Communist Youth League Guzhang County Committee in Hunan Province, Gao Lianying, representative of the Communist Youth League Jianhu County Committee in Jiangsu Province, Zhang Zixin, representative of Dongfeng People's Commune in Anguo County, Hebei Province, Peng Zongshun, a young farmer from Beichuan County, Sichuan Province, Li Huanxue, a young worker from Taiyuan Textile Factory (written speech), and Zhu Lihua, a young worker from Jinan Renfeng Yarn Factory (written speech).

Hui Zhongquan, Deputy Minister of Forestry, gave a report on forestry construction issues at the meeting this afternoon.

The conference will continue tomorrow.

    打破迷信思想　发挥集体智慧
    做古今中外没有做过的事
    青年积极分子报告敢想敢干的共产主义风格
    据新华社27日讯　在全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会今天的发言中，来自工业战线和农业战线上的青年积极分子，用他们亲身的经历，证明了党和毛主席提出的破除迷信、解放思想这一号召的无比正确，歌颂了敢想、敢说、敢干这种共产主义风格的光辉的胜利。
    一个普通的二十三岁的青年养路工，创造成功了一种世界各国还没有的新型铁路道岔，大大提高了运输效率。这个敢想敢干的青年就是北京铁路局丰台工务段的养路工王玉书。他今天在会上以非常鼓舞人心的语调向大家报告了自己的事迹。
    王玉书在今年大跃进中，看到工农业生产都在飞跃发展，而铁路运输效率还很低，特别是道岔问题是最大的障碍，每当列车通过道岔时必须降低速度一半以上。他为此很着急，就下决心要设法改进道岔。在试验过程中，他得到党总支书记的鼓励和支持，终于试验成功了这种新型道岔。这种道岔可以提高行车速度，例如在从北京到上海，每趟列车就可以缩短行车时间一个小时，每天可以为国家增加约六万元的财富。由于这种道岔制造简单，成本低廉，还可以节省大量钢轨。如果全国车站全部换成这种道岔，节省下来的钢轨，就可以铺设五百公里的铁路，能节省一千八百万元。
    攻克尖端技术堡垒，除了需要破除迷信思想以外，还必须相互协作发挥集体智慧。西安地球物理仪器修造厂技术员王忠礼在发言中，用他们厂里的事实说明了这个道理。
    王忠礼说，他们厂青年在党的教导下破除了迷信思想，普遍向尖端技术进军以后，又出现了一种不正常的情绪——独自闯关。这里面有两种情况：个别人出自个人英雄主义，想露一手，不愿同人合作，更多的人则是由于怕搞不成，遇到非难，不敢声张。他自己当时就有这种思想。他在去年就开始试验放射性测井仪，但一直没敢说出来。有的人几次失败也不吭声，仍是一个人悄悄地干着。这就严重影响了研究的效果。这时党委领导同志教导他们说：“一个人的智慧终究是有限的，发挥集体智慧，作用就大了。”同时又对那些站在旁边指手划脚的人进行了批评。这样，就消除了青年们的顾虑，增强了他们的信心；许多青年立即改变了单枪匹马的做法，主动和其他人合作，群策群力猛攻尖端技术。这样做的结果。他们发明创造了许多新产品，其中十六种达到国内和国际先进水平的产品，没有一件不是发挥集体智慧的结果。
    “劳动人民是生产实践斗争的主人，而实践是科学之本，科学不是少数科学家、专家所能垄断的，铁的事实证明，那些轻视实践、脱离实践的资产阶级专家并不聪明，劳动人民比他们聪明百倍、千倍、万倍。他们能够做到的，我们一定能够做到；他们不能做到的，我们也能做到。”这是来自广东省新会县的青年农民育种家周汉华的发言中一段精辟的论断。
    这个年轻的农民，三年来曾经进行过三十二个水稻品种杂交试验，其中用水稻与高粱杂交，培育成功了六个高额丰产的新品种，它们都具有粗粳、根系发达、抗病害、抗倒伏力强、穗长、粒多、粒重的特点。最好的出穗长达九寸多，平均每穗三百多粒，秆壮硬，抽穗时受到八级台风的袭击仍不倒伏，还可以抗稻热病。今年他又进行了以高粱作母本、水稻作父本的杂交试验，同时还用香草与水稻杂交试验，要培育出一种气味芬芳的品种。这些试验都已初步成功。
    今天在大会上发言的还有来自福建前线炮兵部队的代表徐恒准和厦门市前线少年支前活动大队的代表何大年。徐恒准以“不许敌炮‘发言’”为题，报告了他们一个连在炮击金门的战斗中所取得的胜利战绩。他们在战斗中做到了又狠、又准、又省地打击敌人，在不到一个月的时间里，除了与兄弟部队一同作战外，单独对敌人三十七个目标进行了九十一次轰击，共击毁敌战防炮两门，汽车一辆、指挥所、观察所、战防炮工事和掩护部各一所，完成了上级交给他们的任务。当徐恒准以坚强有力的声音说到：“只要我们在这里，就没有敌人炮兵的‘发言权’”！“我们随时为解放台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖而战斗！”的时候，全场报以热烈的暴风雨般的掌声。
    今天下午，驻京部队陆、海、空三军青年代表向大会献礼。当五百多个青年战士分别抬着和高举着“保卫祖国”，“一定解放台澎金马”的大字标语牌，迈着威武整齐的步伐走进大会会场时，全体青年积极分子都站起来热烈鼓掌，向社会主义建设的坚强保卫者们表示感谢。献礼的青年战士们今天把福建前线空军战士击落的蒋军飞机的残骸，把他们自己设计和制造的飞机、大炮、军舰的模型，以及标明他们在建设现代化国防军方面，在支援钢铁，农业生产等方面取得巨大成就的图表、模型和实物，献给了大会。三军青年代表在向大会献词中，表示决心学习青年积极分子的榜样，在保卫和建设社会主义祖国中做出更大的贡献。
    今天的大会上，洋溢着青春的欢乐情绪。一些青年积极分子在发言时遏止不住内心的喜悦和激动，都兴奋地拉开嗓子唱了起来。著名的纺织工人黄宝妹在朗读她和其他十三名纺织工人的联名发言的最后，用越剧的曲调唱了一首欢呼纺织工人大跃进的诗。来自景阳岗的“活武松”——高心孚在发言中插了两段山东特有的“武老二”快板，歌颂他们寿张县景阳岗“武松”生产队大闹丰产的情况。最后发言的是一位来自安徽省的过了二十年童养媳的痛苦生活的女农民歌手殷光兰，她在发言时更是大唱特唱，她说：我要唱得人人争上游，唱得红旗到处飘。这些象征着光明和幸福的歌声久久地荡漾在整个会场上。
    今天在大会上发言的共二十一人，他们之中还有山西太原矿山机器厂青年工程师杜济民，哈尔滨电机厂、锅炉厂、汽轮机厂青年代表洪邦俊（联合发言），云南东川新塘矿火箭炼铜炉炉长李小全，本溪第一钢铁厂一号青年高炉代表张玉璞，湖北麻城县“五四”炼铁厂厂长陈玉满，西北国棉五厂工人杨彩霞，共青团山西省石楼县委书记胡宝玉，共青团湖南省古丈县委书记田家义，共青团江苏省建湖县委代表高联英，河北省安国县东风人民公社代表张自新，四川省北川县青年农民彭宗顺，太原纺织厂青年工人李焕雪（书面发言），济南仁丰纱厂青年工人朱丽华（书面发言）。
    林业部副部长惠中权今天下午在会上作了关于林业建设问题的报告。
    大会明天将继续进行。
