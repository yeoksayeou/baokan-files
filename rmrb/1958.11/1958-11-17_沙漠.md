    Desert
    The total desert area in China is approximately 1.63 billion mu, accounting for 11% of the country's total land area, and is mostly distributed in the six provinces (regions) of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai. Deserts can be classified according to their degree of vegetation cover: fixed sandy land, mobile sandy land, and semi-mobile sandy land. Fixed sandy land has a vegetation cover of over 60% and can be used as pasture. Semi-mobile sandy land has a vegetation cover between 30% and 50%, with some shifting sand still moving. If measures such as enclosing the sand for vegetation cultivation or rational utilization are not implemented, it can easily become mobile sandy land. Mobile sandy land has no vegetation or very little vegetation, moves with the wind, and causes the greatest harm. Among the aforementioned six provinces (regions), mobile sandy land accounts for approximately 400 million mu; semi-mobile sandy land accounts for approximately 410 million mu.
    The formation of deserts is mainly due to the weathering of rocks, the sedimentation of ancient rivers and lakes, the alluvial deposits of modern rivers, and the accumulation of wind. In addition, some of the sources of shifting sand are also affected by human activities, such as overgrazing, excessive logging, or indiscriminate reclamation, which cause previously fixed sandy land to become bare again, leading to the formation of shifting sand under the action of wind. The speed of shifting sand movement is generally around two to five meters per year, and in some cases, it can reach fifteen to twenty meters. The direction of shifting sand movement varies depending on the prevailing and secondary wind directions in different regions and at different times.

    沙漠
    我国沙漠总面积约十六亿三千多万亩，占全国土地面积的11％，绝大部分分布在新疆、内蒙古、宁夏、陕西、甘肃、青海六个省（区）。沙漠按其植物覆盖程度可分为：固定沙地、流动沙地和半流动沙地。固定沙地植物覆盖度在60％以上，可作为牧场。半流动沙地植物覆盖度在30％—50％之间，其中仍有流沙在移动，如不实行封沙育草或利用不当时，极易变为流动沙地。流动沙地没有植被或植被极少，随风移动，危害最大。在上述六省（区）中，流动沙地约四亿亩；半流动沙地约四亿一千万亩。
    沙漠的形成，主要是由于岩石的风化、古代河流湖泊的沉积、现代河流的冲积以及风力的堆积。此外，也有一部分流沙的来源是受人为影响，如过度的放牧、樵采或滥垦，使原已固定的沙地重新裸露，在风的作用下形成流沙。流沙移动速度一般每年在二至五公尺左右，有的可达到十五至二十公尺。流沙的移动方向是随各地、各时主风、次风方向而变化。
