　　(Reported by this newspaper) The "brilliant light of African independence" has cast an "even darker" "shadow" on the West. This is the conclusion that United Press International reporter John MacNaught had to admit in a report commenting on the African national independence movement.

　　John MacNaught said: Since the end of World War II, the "fire of independence" in Africa has "burned brighter and brighter," and this fire of independence will be like "the rising sun, radiating light." He listed the facts, saying that before World War II, only Egypt and Ethiopia had gained independence. After the war, Ghana, Liberia, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, and Sudan all became countries. Now Guinea has decided to break away from France and become independent. Four countries, French Togoland, Cameroon, Nigeria, and Somaliland, are scheduled to be born in 1960.

　　MacNaught was uneasy about the development of the African national independence movement. He said that the number of independent African countries is increasing every year, which "brings new trouble to the West in terms of voting" in the United Nations. The West is finding it "more difficult year by year to control a strong majority on controversial issues." In the final vote on the restoration of the People's Republic of China's seat at this year's UN General Assembly, "of the eight-nation African group, Ghana, Sudan, Morocco, and the United Arab Republic voted against the West. Libya and Tunisia abstained." He said this was "proof" that the United States could no longer easily control the voting machine.

### 非洲独立之火越烧越旺  美国记者惊呼西方面临“新麻烦”

    非洲独立之火越烧越旺
    美国记者惊呼西方面临“新麻烦”
    本报讯　“非洲独立的灿烂的光辉”已经在西方投下了“更为阴暗”的“阴影”。这是美国合众国际社记者约翰·麦克纳特在一篇评述非洲民族独立运动的报道中所不得不承认的结论。
    约翰·麦克纳特说：自从第二次世界大战结束以来，非洲的“独立的火光就燃烧得越来越旺”，这种独立的火光将要像“旭日东升，光芒四射”。他列举事实说，在第二次世界大战以前，只有埃及和埃塞俄比亚获得独立，战后加纳、利比里亚、利比亚、摩洛哥、突尼斯和苏丹都建成了国家。现在几内亚又决定脱离法国而独立。法属多哥、喀麦隆、尼日利亚和索马里兰四个国家预定要在1960年诞生了。
    麦克纳特对非洲民族独立运动的发展感到不安。他说，独立的非洲国家每年都有增加，使得联合国内“在表决方面为西方带来了新的麻烦。西方发现在引起争论的问题上掌握强大的多数是一年比一年更困难了”。在今年联合国大会关于恢复中华人民共和国席位的最后一次表决中，“由八国组成的非洲集团中，加纳、苏丹、摩洛哥和阿拉伯联合共和国四个国家投票反对西方。利比亚和突尼斯弃权”。他说，这是美国再难以掌握表决机器的“一个证明”。
