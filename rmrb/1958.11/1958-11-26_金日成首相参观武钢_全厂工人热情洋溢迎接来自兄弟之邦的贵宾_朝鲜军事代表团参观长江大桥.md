Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 25th: Premier Kim Il-sung, leading the Korean government delegation, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and Hubei Province Governor Zhang Tixue, visited the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex, one of China's three major iron and steel bases, tonight. The distinguished guests received a warm welcome from the workers during their visit to Wuhan Iron and Steel.

The Wuhan Iron and Steel construction site was festively decorated today, especially in the factory front area, the No. 1 blast furnace building, and the coking plant area, where red flags fluttered and people thronged, creating a festive atmosphere everywhere. All the workers on the construction site welcomed the distinguished guests from the fraternal country with unparalleled excitement.

Premier Kim Il-sung and his party arrived at Wuhan Iron and Steel at 6:30 p.m. The factory front area was just beginning to light up, and the construction site was brightly illuminated. As the distinguished guests alighted from their vehicles, Yang Dezong and Jiao Chunhai, renowned labor models from Wuhan Iron and Steel, immediately rushed forward to present them with flowers. Subsequently, Premier Kim Il-sung, accompanied by Premier Zhou and others, slowly walked through the welcoming crowd. At this moment, thunderous applause and cheers resounded from the crowd, with people enthusiastically shouting, "Welcome the Korean government delegation headed by Premier Kim Il-sung," "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people," and "Long live world peace." The applause and cheers lasted for a long time.

Premier Kim Il-sung and others listened to Li Yiqing, General Manager of Wuhan Iron and Steel, introduce the construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel in the reception room of the factory front area, and accepted gifts such as models and pictures of Wuhan Iron and Steel presented by Li Yiqing. They then drove to visit the No. 1 blast furnace, which had already started production. During the visit to the No. 1 blast furnace, Premier Kim Il-sung carefully inquired about the construction and production of the blast furnace. Li Yiqing, General Manager of Wuhan Iron and Steel, and Xie Jian, Director of the Ironmaking Plant, who accompanied the visit, answered one by one. Beside the magnificent blast furnace, Xie Jian told the Premier that the maximum daily iron output of this furnace had greatly exceeded the original design level. Premier Kim Il-sung praised the steel plant for being well-built. Xie Jian replied: "This is a symbol of the friendly solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The No. 1 blast furnace and the entire complex are being built with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union." The Premier smiled and said in Chinese: "This shows that the power of the working class is great, and the power of socialist unity is great!" During the visit to the machine room next to the blast furnace, Premier Kim Il-sung and Premier Zhou Enlai, while visiting, had a cordial conversation with the famous labor model Li Feng'en. The Premier highly praised the workers in this machine room for quickly training a large number of new workers—each shift of six workers brought fourteen apprentices. After leaving the No. 1 blast furnace, the distinguished guests visited the coking plant and the machine repair plant, and were warmly welcomed by the workers.

The Korean military delegation, which arrived in Wuhan today at the same time as the Korean government delegation, visited the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge in the afternoon, accompanied by Lieutenant General Li Chengfang, head of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Wuhan.

    全厂工人热情洋溢迎接来自兄弟之邦的贵宾
    朝鲜军事代表团参观长江大桥
    新华社武汉25日电　金日成首相率领的朝鲜政府代表团，今夜由周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和湖北省省长张体学陪同，参观了我国三大钢铁基地之一的武汉钢铁联合企业。贵宾在武钢参观时，受到了职工们的热烈欢迎。
    武钢建设工地今天张灯结彩，特别是在厂前区、一号高炉厂房和焦化厂一带更是红旗飘扬，人如潮涌，到处是一片节日景象。整个工地的职工都怀着无比振奋的心情来迎接来自兄弟之邦的贵宾。
    金日成首相等在晚上六点半钟到达武钢，厂前区这时正是华灯初上的时候，建设工地上更是灯火辉煌。贵宾们下车后，武钢的著名劳动模范杨德重和焦春海等立即跑上前去向他们献花。随后，金日成首相由周总理等陪同缓步穿过夹道欢迎的人群。这时，人群中响起了春雷般的掌声和欢呼声，人们热烈地高呼：“欢迎以金日成首相为首的朝鲜政府代表团”，“中朝人民的友谊万岁”，“世界和平万岁”，掌声和欢呼声经久不息。
    金日成首相等在厂前区接待室听取了武钢总经理李一清介绍武钢的建设情况，并接受了李一清赠送的武钢模型和图片等礼品，随即驱车前往已经开始生产的一号高炉参观。在参观一号高炉时，金日成首相仔细地询问了这座高炉的建设和开工生产后的情况，陪同参观的武钢总经理李一清和炼铁厂厂长谢健等一一作了回答。谢健在这座雄伟的高炉旁告诉首相说，这个炉子的最高日产铁量已经大大超过原来的设计水平。金日成首相夸奖这个钢铁厂建设得很好。谢健回答说：“这是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营友好团结的象征，一号高炉和整个联合企业都是在苏联的无私援助下进行建设的”。首相笑着用中国话说：“这说明工人阶级的力量大，社会主义团结的力量大！”在高炉旁边的机器室参观时，金日成首相和周总理一起，一面参观，一面和著名的劳动模范李凤恩亲切地谈话。首相很赞许这个机器室的工人们，用快速的方法大量培养新工人——每班六个工人又带了十四个徒弟的做法。贵宾们离开一号高炉后又先后参观了焦化厂和机修厂等单位，并且受到职工们的热烈欢迎。
    今天和朝鲜政府代表团同时到达武汉的朝鲜军事代表团，下午在解放军驻武汉部队首长李成芳中将陪同下参观了武汉长江大桥。
