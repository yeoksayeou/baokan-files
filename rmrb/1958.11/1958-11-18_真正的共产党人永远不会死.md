    True Communists Never Die
    Ge De

    On the afternoon of October 23rd, a Communist Party member, Li Changzu, died at the Shuikouzi coal mine entrance of the Gaoyuqi Coal Mine in Qidong County, Hunan Province. According to newspaper reports: "Suddenly, the entire factory shed tilted into an 80-degree slope and continued to slope downward. Communist Party member Liu Jinghua hurriedly used his shoulder to support the main pillar of the factory shed, but still couldn't stop the shed from sloping. Seeing that the factory shed was about to collapse, Li Changzu, in a critical moment, ran from outside the shed into the shed to save the seventeen workers inside. He shouted for everyone to get out of the way, and then ran to Liu Jinghua, pushing him out of the shed. He used all his strength to support the main pillar of the shed with his shoulder, allowing the shed to collapse more slowly so that the workers could escape. The workers heard the sound and quickly moved away, and Liu Jinghua also got half of his body out of the shed. Then, the shed collapsed with a "whoosh," and a horizontal beam struck Li Changzu's chest. The factory shed, weighing over 10,000 jin, fell on Li Changzu. He gloriously sacrificed himself for the cause of the Party and to save others."

    As I read this, I couldn't help but feel tears welling up and a sense of solemn respect. A person fell, but I immediately saw a great image of boundless radiance erected. He was smiling, yet with an awe-inspiring strength, using all his life's energy to shoulder the 10,000-jin heavy shed. That shed seemed no longer to be a tilting, dilapidated structure, but suddenly transformed into a majestic socialist edifice, with the communist red flag fluttering above. The sound of the crashing collapse also transformed into thunder. The founder of that glittering socialist edifice, standing eternally, for thousands of generations without end.

    I recalled, where had I seen this kind of image before? Was it on the Peking Opera stage? The Song Dynasty tiger general, Gao Chong, once single-handedly challenged the Jin army's thirteen iron sledges, finally falling from his horse and dying. No! Facing this ancient hero, I had never seen this glittering light, this majestic edifice, this fluttering red flag. Was it in the story of "Tales of Sui and Tang"? The hero of that time, Xiong Kuohai, once single-handedly shouldered the thousand-jin gate of Yangzhou City, letting all the trapped people escape, and he also finally fell from his horse and died. No! While reading, I had admired his strength and character, but I had never seen this glittering light, this majestic edifice, this fluttering red flag. Ah! I remember, it was on the stage of "Red Storm," when Comrade Lin Xiangqian bravely gave his life, the statue-like heroic body surrounded by thousands of red lights, that had something in common with the great image before me. Communists are like this, whether in the enemy's court or at their construction posts, in the face of collective interests, they never consider personal life or death. They are not born with the strength of Gao Chong or Xiong Kuohai, but they dare to calmly face even more powerful and ferocious enemies and shoulder burdens ten times as heavy. This is precisely what makes a Communist Party member "special," "made of special materials."

    The great Mr. Lu Xun once said that he was willing to shoulder the gate of darkness, to let others go into the light. The struggle against the forces of darkness, in the spiritual realm, created a great hero like Lu Xun. But in the booming and lively construction, even more such heroes were created. Comrade Li Changzu used all his strength to shoulder the 10,000-jin heavy shed, allowing seventeen workers to be reborn, didn't he?

    The great Comrade Li Changzu sacrificed himself! But he taught us what attitude and method to use to treat the revolutionary cause and comrade relations. True Communists never die. One Li Changzu falls, but thousands or even tens of thousands of Li Changzus will learn from him and grow up. After Comrade Luo Shengjiao sacrificed himself, didn't we see living Luo Shengjiaos in the Volunteer Army again? An image of boundless radiance like that of Comrade Li Changzu will stand forever and ever. That great communist thought, that great communist's attitude and method of dealing with things and treating people, will also be passed down forever and ever.

    真正的共产党人永远不会死
    葛德
    10月23日下午，在湖南省祁东县高鱼岐煤矿水口子煤窿口上，有一个共产党员牺牲了，他的名字叫李长足。据报纸的记载：“忽然间，整个厂棚架倾斜成八十度的坡形，并且继续下斜。共产党员刘景华忙用肩去扛住厂棚正柱，还是阻止不了厂棚下斜，眼看厂棚架就要倒下。在这千钧一发的时候，李长足为了要救出厂棚下的十七个工人，连忙从厂棚外跑向棚内，一面高喊大家快躲开；一面跑到刘景华身边，把他推出厂棚外，自己用尽平生之力以肩扛住厂棚正柱，让厂棚慢点倒，好使工人脱险。工人闻声后连忙躲开，刘景华也跑出半个身子在厂棚外，厂棚便“哗”的一声塌下来，一根横梁打中李长足的胸部，一万多斤重的厂棚压到李长足的身上，他为党的事业，为拯救别人而光荣牺牲了。”
    读着读着，我不禁热泪盈眶、肃然起敬。一个人倒下了，但我立刻看到了一个光芒万丈的伟大形象树立起来，他微笑着，但又凛凛然用尽平生之力，肩扛着万斤重的棚架。那棚架似乎不再是倾斜的破旧的棚子，忽而化作了巍峨的社会主义大厦，上面飘扬着共产主义的红旗。哗然的倒塌声也化作了雷鸣。那金光闪闪的社会主义大厦的奠基者，永远地永远地矗立着，千秋万代而不息。
    我追忆着，在哪里见到过这种形象？是在京剧舞台上吗？那宋朝的虎将高宠，曾经单枪力挑金兵的十三辆铁滑车，终于马倒人亡。不是的！面对着这位古代的英雄，我未曾看到过这闪闪金光，这巍峨的大厦，这飘扬的红旗。是在“说隋唐”的故事里面吗？那时的好汉雄阔海，曾经只身肩住了扬州城的千斤闸门，放所有被困的人脱围，而他也终于马倒人亡。不是的！读时我曾赞叹过他的雄壮和为人，但也未曾看到这闪闪的金光，这巍峨的大厦，这飘扬的红旗。啊！记起来了，是在“红色风暴”的舞台上，当林祥谦同志英勇就义时，那被万道红光环绕着的塑像般的英雄躯体，才与我眼前这伟大形象有共同之处。共产党人就是这样的人，无论在敌人的法庭上，还是在建设的岗位上，在集体的利益前面，他们从不计较个人的生死。他们并不生有高宠、雄阔海般的膂力，但他们却敢坦然地面对更加强大凶暴的敌人和肩扛十倍重量的重担。这正是共产党员之所以被称为“用特殊材料制成”的“特殊”处。
    伟大的鲁迅先生曾经说过，他愿肩住黑暗的闸门，放别人到光明中去。同黑暗势力的搏斗，在精神领域里，造就了鲁迅这样伟大的英雄。但是在轰轰烈烈地建设中，造就了更多的这样的英雄，李长足同志不就是用尽平生之力，肩住万斤重的棚架，使十七个工人得到了重生吗？
    伟大的李长足同志牺牲了！可是他教会了我们用什么态度和方法去对待革命事业和同志关系。真正的共产党人是永远不死的。一个李长足倒下了，千万个甚至万万个李长足会学习他而生长起来。在罗盛教同志牺牲之后，我们不是又在志愿军里看到活的罗盛教吗？像李长足同志这样的光芒万丈的形象，将永远永远地矗立着。那伟大的共产主义思想，那伟大共产主义者的处事和为人的态度和方法，也将永远永远地流传着。
