Reform of Kitchen Utensils Saves Labor, Coal and Time

    Yaojiazhuang Township's Many Canteens Innovate Tools
    Vegetable Cutters and Blowers are Universally Used
    (Our newspaper reports) After rectification and consolidation, the one hundred and thirty-five canteens in Yaojiazhuang Township, Wuxiang County, Shanxi, have improved their management systems and meals, achieving diversification of food and dishes. The township party committee further studied the issue of reforming cooking utensils. Comrade Wang Guoging, the party committee secretary, personally went deep into the canteens to establish experimental plots. He participated in kitchen labor, helping cooks carry water and stoke the fire; at the same time, he learned about the situation and listened to the opinions of the cooks. He saw that the cooks worked hard for more than ten hours a day, yet could not finish their work. The cooks also reflected, "Chopping vegetables, operating the bellows, kneading steamed buns, mixing dough, and grinding flour, we can never finish. When we are busy with one thing, we can't take care of another." Comrade Wang Guoging discussed with the cooks how to avoid the chaos. After everyone studied it, they believed that the only way was to reform cooking utensils. Comrade Wang Guoging encouraged everyone to use their brains and think of solutions; at the same time, he organized more than ten carpenters from the woodworking cooperative to help reform cooking utensils. After five days and nights of hard work, they finally created two blowers, two vegetable cutters, one thimble mill, and one each of noodle pellet and steamed bun making machine, all of which were ten times more efficient than manual labor. The most efficient was the thimble mill, which could grind 1,120 jin of flour per person per day, twenty-three times more than the previous mill. After the experiment was successful, the township party committee immediately held an on-site meeting in this canteen to promote it to all canteens in the township. In less than a month, 106 pieces of equipment, including blowers, vegetable cutters, thimble mills, and steamed bun machines, were promoted in all canteens in the township, and ten canteens had fully realized semi-mechanization of cooking.

    姚家庄乡许多食堂革新工具
    普遍使用切菜机吹风机
    本报讯　山西武乡县姚家庄乡的一百三十五个食堂，经过整顿巩固以后，都健全了管理制度，并改善了伙食，做到饭菜多样化。乡党委又进一步研究改革炊事用具问题。党委书记王国庆同志，亲自深入食堂搞试验田，他一面参加厨房劳动，帮助炊事员担水、煽火；一面了解情况，听取炊事员的意见。他看到炊事员们一天辛辛苦苦地干了十几个钟头，活还是干不完。炊事员也反映说：“切菜、拉风箱、捏馍馍、和面、磨面，老是干不完，忙上这一桩，顾不上那一桩。”王国庆同志便和炊事员们研究，如何避免忙乱。经大伙一研究，认为唯一办法只有改革炊事用具。王国庆同志一面发动大家动脑筋，想办法；一面又组织木业社十多个木工来帮助改革炊事用具。经过大伙五天五夜的苦钻，终于创制出吹风机二个，切菜机二个，顶针磨一盘，捏疙瘩、馍馍机各一个，效能都比手工提高十倍以上。效能最高的顶针磨，一人一天能磨面一千一百二十斤，比以前的磨提高二十三倍。试验成功后，乡党委就马上在这个食堂召开现场会议，向全乡食堂推广。不到一个月，在全乡食堂内就推广了吹风机、切菜机、顶针磨、捏馍机等一百零六件，并有十个食堂全部实现了炊事半机械化。
