Handing Production Tasks Directly to the Masses
Jiangyou, Sichuan Holds Representatives Meeting of Steel Warriors

(By our reporter) Sichuan Province's Jiangyou County has launched a mass movement by convening a representative meeting of steel production warriors, pushing production to a new high. Experience proves that this type of representative meeting is the best way to rely on the masses in steel production, deeply mobilize the masses, closely link leadership with the masses, exchange experiences, organize high yields, and ensure quality.

Jiangyou County has eight groups of native blast furnaces. These steel warriors are all farmers who have just left the countryside. Although they are full of enthusiasm, they have encountered many problems in production and life, resulting in low yields. Faced with this situation, the various work areas held representative meetings in late October. At the meetings, the idea of doubting the small native furnaces was criticized in full and frank discussions, and the fundamental question of for whom the steel was being produced was resolved.

Through the representative meetings, the past practice of only assigning tasks to cadres, with little discussion among the masses, was changed. Based on in-depth ideological mobilization, the current steel production tasks, targets, measures, and methods were directly handed over to the masses and transformed into conscious actions through mass discussion. Many people revised production targets, implemented a contract responsibility system for furnaces and output, and formulated labor quotas and collective agreements according to the type of work. As a result, the production outlook of the work areas underwent a complete transformation. Within eight days, more than two thousand new iron-smelting kilns were built, 80,000 tons of ore were mined, and 200,000 tons of fuel were rushed to the furnaces. Daily pig iron production jumped from dozens of tons before the representative meetings to more than three thousand tons of good iron within a week.

Through the representative meetings, the ties between leaders and the masses were further strengthened, and unity was enhanced. What was previously said only in private was now spoken out at the meetings. Based on the opinions put forward by the masses, many leading cadres not only actively involved workers in production management and suggested rational improvements, but also strengthened their concern for the lives of the workers.

### 把生产任务直接交给群众  四川江油开钢铁战士代表会

    把生产任务直接交给群众
    四川江油开钢铁战士代表会
    本报讯　四川省江油县通过召开钢铁生产战士代表会议，大搞群众运动，把生产推向新的高潮。经验证明，这种代表会议是钢铁生产中依靠群众、深入发动群众、密切领导与群众联系、交流经验、组织高产、保证质量的一种最好形式。
    江油县境有八处土高炉群，这些钢铁战士都是刚离开农村的农民，他们虽然干劲冲天，但在生产、生活上都出现不少问题，以致产量较低。面对这种情况，10月下旬各工区分别召开了工区代表会议。会议在大鸣大放中批判了怀疑小土群的论点，解决了为谁炼钢铁的根本问题。
    通过代表会议，改变了过去只把任务交给干部，而很少让广大群众讨论的情况，在深入思想发动的基础上，把当前钢铁生产的任务、指标、措施和方法，直接交给群众，通过群众讨论，变为群众自觉的行动。许多人重新修订了生产指标，推行包炉包产制，按照工种制订劳动定额和集体公约，因而工区生产面貌焕然一新。八天内，新修了两千多个炼铁大窑，采矿石八万吨，抢运燃料二十万吨，生铁日产量由代表会议前的数十吨，在一周内一跃而产三千多吨好铁。
    通过代表会议，进一步密切了领导和群众的联系，增强了团结。过去只在下边讲、背后说的话，都在会上讲出来了。许多领导干部根据群众提出的意见，不仅积极吸收工人参加生产管理、提合理化建议，而且还特别加强了对工人生活的关怀。
