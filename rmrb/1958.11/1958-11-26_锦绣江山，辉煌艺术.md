    Splendid Rivers and Mountains, Brilliant Art
    Xiang Yu
    Korea has a long history and a splendid culture. The Korean people proudly call their land "three thousand miles of embroidered rivers and mountains." The Korean people have repeatedly sent their artistic envoys to visit and perform in our country, leaving a deep impression on our people. This performance by the Art Troupe of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea allows us to happily see that Korean artists have made new progress on the road of building socialist literature and art.
    After watching the art troupe's performance, the most profound impression left on us is that their programs clearly demonstrate that Korean literary and art workers have firmly embarked on the road of socialist realism, which is to develop their national, socialist new literature and art. The characteristics of Korean new art are: close integration with the real life of the working people, fighting heroism and internationalism, creative development of national artistic heritage, and excellent application of modern art forms.
    The art troupe's performance began with the majestic mixed chorus "Forward Following the Banner of the Workers' Party" and ended with the jubilant and enthusiastic large-scale dance "Celebrating the Harvest" and "Chollima." This illustrates that the comrades of the art troupe have grasped the two most important themes of contemporary art creation: the leadership of the Party is the most fundamental guarantee of all victories and achievements, and the people's greatest desire is first and foremost the Chollima-like high-speed leap forward in construction. In addition, songs such as the female chorus "Song of the Weavers," the dance "Iron and Steel Flow," and the Gayageum singing "Girl Picking Camellias" are all themes related to production and construction, which all show that the works of Korean artists are closely integrated with the real life of the working people.
    The heroism of the Korean people is deeply reflected in the art troupe's programs. Among them, the ancient dance "Warrior Dance," which has been rearranged and processed, shows the Korean people's fighting tradition of resisting oppression and defending against foreign insults. The male chorus "Song of the Heroic Automobile Driver" praises the heroic spirit of the Korean People's Army in despising the American paper tiger in the war against aggression. What makes us particularly feel close is that the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean People's Armies is vividly reproduced in the dance "Meeting on the Highland." The heroic image of the Korean people performed by the art troupe greatly inspires the Chinese people who are fighting against the aggression of American imperialism. We also sincerely thank the art troupe for performing the work "Plant the Victory Banner on Taiwan" by our Chinese composer Xiao He with a high degree of internationalism, which is a strong support for the just struggle of our people.
    Distinct national characteristics are one of the important reasons for the success of the art troupe's performance. The "Sword Dance" and "Fan Dance" in the dance are undeniably unique Korean national dances, but in artistic processing, they do not show any traces of being mixed with foreign art forms. National musical instruments such as the Gayageum and flute have been given new life by the actors of the art troupe. The singing sound or even the reciting intonation blown by the flute is extremely moving. In the accompaniment orchestra, not only have national musical instruments been fully utilized, but also the unique rhythm and distinctive style of Korean national music are clearly discernible, which gives our musicians great inspiration.
    The audience affirmed the high artistic achievements of the Korean artists with satisfaction and warm applause. The dance of the meritorious actor An Shengji left a deep impression on us. Her "Pearl Fairy Dance" created on the basis of folk dance (which reminds us of the Chinese Clam Dance) has amazing charm and portrays the beautiful image of Korean women. In the "Gypsy" dance, she accurately depicts the passionate and indomitable character of the Gypsy people, which is impossible to do without a high level of artistic accomplishment. The choir is composed of well-trained actors, and under the direction of Park Kwang-woo, it demonstrates a high degree of professional skill: the sound is harmonious and balanced, with profound expressiveness, and has both strength and timbre changes; their performance of "Spring Song" is very colorful. The author of the dance "Iron and Steel Flow" used rich imagination to use a group of red-dressed girls to perform the molten iron bursting out of the furnace, which is full of romanticism.
    The art troupe's programs include a considerable number of Chinese works. Their respect and love for our art, as well as the hard work they put in to prepare these programs, deeply moved us. For example, the performance of the dance "Flowers and Teenagers" and many songs such as "High on Prince Mountain" make it really hard to believe that they are performing works from another country. The soprano Kim Jeom-soon's performance of the Chinese folk song "Mayila" has her own creation in the treatment. The efforts of Korean artists in this area particularly illustrate their sincere desire to develop cultural exchanges between China and Korea.
    I wish the friends of the Korean Art Troupe greater success in their performances in China! May the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people last forever!

    锦绣江山，辉煌艺术
    向隅
    朝鲜有着悠久的历史和灿烂的文化，朝鲜人民自豪地称他们的国土为“三千里锦绣江山”。朝鲜人民曾多次派出他们的艺术使者来我国访问演出，给我国人民留下了深刻的印象。这次朝鲜民主主义人民共和国艺术团的演出，使我们欣喜地看到朝鲜艺术家们在建设社会主义文艺的道路上又有了新的进展。
    看了艺术团的演出，留给我们最深刻的印象是他们的节目鲜明地显示出朝鲜的文艺工作者坚定地走上了社会主义现实主义的道路，也就是发展他们民族的、社会主义新文艺的道路。构成朝鲜新艺术特点的有这样几个方面：与劳动人民的现实生活紧密相结合，战斗的英雄主义与国际主义，民族艺术遗产的创造性的发展，近代艺术形式的卓越的运用。
    艺术团的演出以雄伟的混声合唱“跟随着劳动党的旗帜前进”开始，而以欢腾热烈的大型舞蹈“庆丰收”、“千里马”结束。这是说明了艺术团的同志们抓住了当代艺术创作的两个最重要的主题：党的领导是一切胜利和成就的最根本的保证，而人民的最大愿望首先是建设事业的千里马一般的高速度的跃进。此外像女声小合唱“织布工之歌”，舞蹈“铁水奔流”，伽耶琴弹唱
  “摘山茶的姑娘”等都是生产建设方面的题材，这些都说明朝鲜艺术家的作品是和劳动人民的现实生活紧密结合的。
    朝鲜人民的英雄主义在艺术团的节目中有着深刻的反映。其中，经过整理加工的古代舞蹈“武士舞”，表现了朝鲜人民反抗压迫和抵御外侮的战斗传统。“英雄的汽车司机之歌”这首男声小合唱歌颂了朝鲜人民军在反侵略战争中藐视美国纸老虎的英雄气概。特别使我们感到亲切的是中朝人民军队的战斗友谊在“相逢在高地上”这个舞蹈中生动地再现出来。艺术团表演的朝鲜人民的英雄形象给正在和美帝国主义的侵略进行斗争的中国人民以极大的鼓舞。我们也衷心感谢艺术团以高度的国际主义精神表演了我国作曲家晓河的作品“把胜利的旗帜插到台湾”，这是对我国人民正义斗争的有力支援。
    鲜明的民族色彩是艺术团的演出获得成功的重要原因之一。舞蹈中的“剑舞”和“扇舞”，无可争辩地是朝鲜所特有的民族舞蹈，而在艺术加工上却并不显出有与外来艺术形式混杂的痕迹。像伽耶琴和笛子这样的民族乐器，都被艺术团的演员们赋予了新的生命。笛子吹出的歌唱般的声音甚至是朗诵的语调，是极其动人的。在伴奏乐队中，不仅民族乐器得到了充分的发挥，而且朝鲜民族音乐特有的节奏和别具风格的音调也是鲜明可辨的，这些都给我国音乐工作者以极大的启发。
    观众以满意的心情和热烈的掌声肯定了朝鲜艺术家们的高度艺术成就。功勋演员安圣姬的舞蹈给了我们很深的印象。她以民间舞蹈为基础创作的“珍珠姬舞”（这使我们想起了中国的蚌舞）有惊人的魅力，刻划了朝鲜妇女的美丽形象。在“吉普赛”舞中，她准确地描绘出吉普赛人的热情奔放而又坚忍倔强的性格，如果不是有高度的艺术素养是不可能做到的。合唱队是由训练有素的演员组成的，在朴光羽的指挥下表现了高度的专业技巧：声音和谐而均衡，富有表情的深刻性，兼有力度和音色的变化；他们表演的“春之歌”是很有色彩的。舞蹈“铁水奔流”的作者运用丰富的想像，用一群全身红装的少女来表演从熔炉中夺口而出的铁水，富有浪漫主义色彩。
    艺术团的节目里面包括相当数量的中国作品。他们对我国艺术的尊重和热爱，以及为了准备这些节目所付出的艰苦劳动，使我们深深感动。如舞蹈“花儿与少年”及“高高太子山”等许多歌曲的表演，确实很难使人相信他们是在表演另一个国家的作品。女高音歌唱家金点顺演唱的中国民歌“玛依拉”，在处理上是有她自己的创造的。朝鲜艺术家们在这个方面的努力，格外说明了他们在发展中朝文化交流上的真诚愿望。
    祝朝鲜艺术团的朋友们在中国的演出获得更大的成功！愿中朝两国人民战斗的友谊万古长青！
