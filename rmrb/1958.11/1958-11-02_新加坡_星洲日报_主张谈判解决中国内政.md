Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, November 1st. Singapore's "Sin Chew Jit Poh" published an editorial on the Taiwan issue on October 24th, advocating resolving the internal affairs of the Chinese people themselves between the mainland and Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu through peaceful negotiations. It stated, "Negotiation is not only a possible idea but will also be the only reasonable conclusion." The editorial said, "If both sides are sincere, then the path of negotiation is a convenient way to achieve the goal of peaceful liberation." This overseas Chinese newspaper said, however, "Judging from the current situation, the above speculation is undoubtedly overly optimistic."

    新加坡“星洲日报”
    主张谈判解决中国内政
    新华社香港1日电　新加坡“星洲日报”在10月24日发表的评论台湾问题的社论中，赞成通过和平谈判的道路，解决大陆和台、澎、金、马之间中国人自己的内政。它说，“谈判不特是意想中的可能，并将是唯一合理的结论”。社论说，“如果互相出于真诚，则谈判的门路，又是达成和平解放目标的顺便道路”。这家华侨报纸说，可是，“照目前情形说，上述推想，无疑陷于过度乐观”。
