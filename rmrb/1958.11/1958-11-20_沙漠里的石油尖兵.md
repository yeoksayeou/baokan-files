    Petroleum Pioneers in the Desert
    By Our Correspondent Han Wenhui
    This year, a petroleum prospecting team in Xinjiang entered the Tarim Desert three times, a place that many people in history had wanted to enter but failed to do so. They surveyed 150,000 square kilometers, planted the red flag of geological prospecting in the heart of the desert, an area that had always been a blank spot on geological maps, and wrote a glorious page in the history of petroleum exploration.
        The Myth of Taklamakan
    The Taklamakan Desert is located in the center of the Tarim Basin and covers an area of 400,000 square kilometers, making it one of the largest deserts in the world. In the Uyghur language, "Taklamakan" means "enter and never come out." Farmers on the edge of the desert circulate many myths about the desert. They say that this desert was once a flat land, but a great black wind blew in some unknown era, turning the flat land into a desert. Inside, there is also an ancient city with a lot of gold. Many years ago, three long-distance travelers drove donkeys to this ancient city to find gold. After they pushed open the city gate, the city was piled with gold. When they took the gold and went out, the city gate immediately closed. When they put down the gold, the city gate opened again. In the history of old China, the Swedish explorer Sven Hedin entered from the southern part of the desert and lost seven camels and three servants along the way. Sven Hedin himself finally crawled to Hotan in only a pair of pants, where he was rescued by local herders. For many years, the Taklamakan Desert has given people the impression of being terrifying and magical. Although two geological teams have visited the western part of the desert since liberation, the eastern half of the desert is still a blank spot.
          We Must Go In
    On April 5th this year, a petroleum exploration vanguard team composed of 104 people, including geologists, surveyors, telegraph operators, doctors, and Uyghur farmers—the 505 Prospecting Team—accepted the glorious task assigned to them by the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration and the Party Committee to understand the geological structure of the desert. They took more than 300 camels, carrying large amounts of drinking water and food, and divided into three groups, starting their battle with the great desert from the borders of Hotan and Yutian counties.
    The entire Taklamakan Desert, except for the areas where the Hotan River and Yutian River pass through, has no surface water in its 400,000 square kilometers. Water in the desert is called pearls. The reason why people failed in the past was because they ran out of water. The prospecting team filled more than 100 large wooden barrels with water on the edge of the desert, which were carried by camels specifically for living water. The team members each drank only two jin of water per day, and did not wash their faces or brush their teeth. The water used to wash rice was used to wash the pot. The water used to wash the pot the previous night was used to wash the pot again the next morning, and then used to water the camels. Everyone tried their best to save water to ensure the people's living water. Camels relied on the team members digging groundwater in the desert to supply them with water. The camel, known as the ship of the desert, its ability to resist thirst cannot exceed three days at most. If groundwater cannot be dug, the ship of the desert and the exploration team members will be in desperate situation.
    The exploration team members all understood that the camel's water problem was related to the success or failure of entering the desert and everyone's lives. From the first day of entering the desert, they measured guide wires and geological points during the day, and after work in the evening, everyone surrounded a sandy area to dig groundwater. The second and third groups both dug water within three or four days of entering the desert, but the first group's water digging work was not going well. Four days passed, the camels' drinking water period had passed, and no groundwater had been dug. According to experience, groundwater can be dug wherever there are reeds and wild hemp outcrops, but the deeper you go into the desert, the harder it is to encounter wild plants. All that could be seen were yellow sand dunes. The team headquarters sent telegrams every day to inquire about the water digging situation, and they had to answer that there were no results. By the sixth day, dozens of camels were so thirsty that it was difficult to move. At night, everyone dug a well four meters wide and four meters deep, but the bottom of the well was still dry. The team members stood beside the well in silence. At this time, the camel driver said that the grass for the camels was also gone. This very dangerous situation alarmed many people in the group.
    The desert is five hundred kilometers wide, and only a little over a hundred kilometers have been walked. What should we do? After dinner, Zhao Hongquan, the Communist Party member and group leader, immediately convened an emergency meeting of the entire group. He said at the meeting: In the past, foreigners withdrew from the desert under such circumstances. Are we going to declare failure halfway like them? After discussion, everyone finally came up with a way to move forward. They decided to reduce people's living water to save the camels. They took out all the wheat straw that was padded in the camel saddles to feed the camels, and then cut off the camel hair and padded it in the saddle bags. The next day they continued to move forward. On the eighth day, after entering 130 kilometers, they finally dug out water.
      We Must Work Hard for Oil, No Matter How Hard It Is
    In the desert, the exploration team members faced unpredictable climate disasters every day. Sometimes the sky was blue and the desert was dry and sultry; sometimes a dark cloud appeared overhead, and a gust of wind rolled up a black sandstorm and pounced on people. The desert suddenly became dim, and only the rustling of fine sand rolling underfoot could be heard, and the face felt like someone was constantly hitting it with sand. The exploration team members encountered such sandstorms several times a day. When eating, everyone often had to cover their heads and bowls with clothes to avoid eating sand. After a day of work, ears, noses, and clothes pockets were filled with sand.
    When the sandstorm filled the earth and the surveyors could not see the range pole, they shortened the distance and measured it little by little. The sand hit the surveyors' eyes, and they wiped it off and looked at the instrument again; if the range pole was not upright, the workers tried their best to hold it up. Once the sandstorm passed, the sun was like a ball of fire, shining on the desert, and the temperature in the wilderness suddenly rose to 45 degrees Celsius. Everyone's lips were cracked, some people had nosebleeds, and some people fainted in the desert while walking. However, none of the exploration team members said a word of "bitterness," and no one asked to increase the water supply. Everyone used the water in their water bottles to rescue the fainted comrades and continued to move forward. In this way, they increased the daily measurement speed from the initial ten kilometers to eighteen kilometers.
    One day, the surveyor Yuan Xiurong was working with a range pole when a gale suddenly rose and the sandstorm filled the area where they were working, and no one could see anyone else. Yuan Xiurong hugged the range pole and ran back. She ran over several sand mountains in one breath, but she couldn't see anyone in the group. She ran forward while blowing her whistle and waving the red flag on the range pole to make contact. But no one responded. At this time, she realized that she was lost and was so tired that her lips were dry, her tongue was parched and her legs were weak. But this innocent and lovely seventeen-year-old girl didn't cry or feel scared. She thought that the comrades in the group would definitely find her. She checked her water bottle, and there was still a little more than half a bottle of water. She inserted the range pole on the top of the sand dune, covered her head with clothes, and slept under the range pole. When the comrades in the group found her in the afternoon, everyone thought she would cry a lot. But she laughed and told her comrades about her experience of getting lost.
          Interesting Desert Life
    In the arduous desert life, the exploration team members were full of optimism. Whenever the morning and evening glow came to the desert, it was the time for the team members to go to work and finish work. Everyone carried range poles and instruments, led a group of camels, stepped on the golden desert, and sang loudly to welcome and end their day's work. After camping in the evening, white tents, wisps of smoke, and camel herds appeared in the open desert. In this picturesque nature, the exploration team members sat comfortably on the soft sand and began their daily one-and-a-half-hour political study. They studied the twelve lectures on youth self-cultivation chapter by chapter and discussed the life goals of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Although they lived in the vast and desolate desert world, their thoughts were beating together with the pulse of the motherland's Great Leap Forward.
    The strange desert often brought many unexpected interesting things to their lives. Sometimes a lost little bird suddenly fell beside them, and sometimes a fly of unknown origin appeared on their bodies. Everyone launched a siege on this rare thing, thinking that this was a harbinger of the appearance of trees and people. But the result was just an empty joy. In the desert, because there was no water to wash their faces, the place where sweat flowed was stuck with a layer of sand and soil, and everyone's face was black and white. Everyone looked at each other and laughed. One night, everyone was sleeping soundly on the beach when an unexpected heavy rain suddenly struck. After the team members were awakened, they jumped out of their beds and shouted, "It's raining, wash your face quickly!" The rare desert nectar caused a burst of excitement.
    The exploration team members were even happier about geological discoveries than finding groundwater. One afternoon, as the second group of team members was about to finish work, they suddenly discovered a dark hill standing alone in the desert. The geologists immediately shouted, "Comrades, cheer up! There may be an outcrop ahead." When everyone heard that it was an outcrop, they cheered and ran forward one after another. When they got closer, it was indeed an outcrop of the Tertiary strata. This discovery, which was of great value for explaining the geological structure and oil-bearing prospects of the desert, made the team members feel more honored for their work. Everyone happily collected mineral samples, sent telegrams, and reported good news to the team headquarters. Although they ate dry food and drank cold water to satisfy their hunger that night, they were in high spirits and speculated on the underground secrets of the great desert.

    沙漠里的石油尖兵
    本报记者　韩文慧
    今年，新疆一支石油普查队的队员们，曾经三次进入了历史上许多人曾经想进去但没有实现的塔里木大沙漠，普查了十五万平方公里，把地质普查的红旗插在地质史上一直是个空白点的沙漠腹地，在石油勘探史上写下了光辉的一页。
        塔克拉玛干的神话
    塔克拉玛干大沙漠位于塔里木盆地中央，它的面积达四十万平方公里，是世界上最大的沙漠之一。“塔克拉玛干”在维吾尔语中是“进去出不来”的意思。沙漠边缘的农民中间流传着许多关于沙漠的神话。他们说这片沙漠很早是一片平地，不知什么年代刮了一次大黑风，平地变成了沙漠，里面还有一座古城，城里有很多金子。多少年以前，有三个远途的跋涉者赶着毛驴到这座古城去找金子。他们推开城门以后，城里堆满了金子，当他们拿上金子往外走的时候，城门立即紧闭，放下金子，城门又开了。在旧中国的历史上，瑞典探险家斯文赫定从沙漠南部进去后，中途死掉七峰骆驼、三个仆人，斯文赫定本人最后只穿了一条裤子狼狈不堪地爬到和阗，被当地牧民救活了性命。多少年来，塔克拉玛干大沙漠给人的印象是恐怖而又神奇。解放后虽然有两个地质队先后到过沙漠西部，但沙漠东边大半部还是个空白点。
          我们一定要进去
    今年4月5日，一支有地质、测量、电报员、医生和维吾尔族农民等一百零四人组成的石油勘探尖兵——五零五普查队，接受了新疆石油管理局和党委交给他们了解沙漠地质结构的光荣任务，带了三百多峰骆驼，驮着大量饮水和粮草，分成三个小组，分别从和阗、于阗县境踏上了与大沙漠战斗的征途。
    整个塔克拉玛干大沙漠，除在和阗河与于阗河经过的地方有水外，这四十多万平方公里的面积上，全是茫茫无际的黄色沙丘，没有一滴地面水。沙漠里的水被人唤作珍珠，历史上进沙漠的人所以中途失败，就是因为断了水。普查队在沙漠边缘用一百多个大木桶装满水，由骆驼驮上专门供作生活用水。队员们每天每人只喝二斤水，一律不洗脸、不刷牙。淘了米的水洗锅，先一天晚上洗完锅的水，第二天早晨再洗锅，然后去饮骆驼。大家想尽一切办法节约用水，来保证人的生活用水。骆驼饮水全靠队员们在沙漠挖地下水来供应。被称为沙漠之舟的骆驼，它的抗渴能力最多不能超过三天，如果挖不到地下水，这个沙漠之舟和勘探队员都会陷入绝境。
    勘探队员们都懂得骆驼吃水问题关系着进沙漠的成败和大家的生命，他们从进入沙漠的第一天起，白天测量导线和地质点，黄昏收工后大家围着一块沙地挖地下水。第二组和第三组在进入沙漠三四天内，都挖出一次水，唯有第一组挖水工作很不顺利。四天过去了，骆驼饮水期限已过，还没挖出地下水。根据经验，凡是有芦苇和野麻露头的地方，都能挖出地下水来，但越深入沙漠越难遇见野生植物。眼前全是黄澄澄的沙丘。队部每天来电报查问挖水情况，他们只好回答没有结果。到第六天，几十峰骆驼已渴得很难移动；晚上大家挖了一口四公尺宽、四公尺深的井，井下还是干的，队员们站在井旁都默默不语。就在这时候，骆驼夫说骆驼吃的草也完了，这种十分危险的情况，使组里许多人都惊慌起来。
    五百公里宽的沙漠，只走了百余公里，怎么办哩！晚饭后，共产党员小组长赵洪铨立即召开了全组紧急会议。他在会上说：过去外国人就是在这种情况下退出沙漠的，难道我们像他们一样，也中途宣告失败吗？经过讨论，大家终于想出了前进的办法。他们决定减少人的生活用水急救骆驼。把骆驼鞍夹中垫的麦草全部掏出来喂骆驼，然后把骆驼毛剪下来，垫在鞍夹当中。第二天他们又继续前进。到第八天，进入一百三十公里的地方，终于挖出了水。
      为了石油再苦也要干
    勘探队员们在沙漠里，每天要遭到变幻无常的气候灾难。有时天空湛蓝湛蓝，沙漠又干燥、又闷热；有时头顶出现一团乌云，狂风便卷起一片黑沉沉的黄沙向人扑来，沙漠顿时一片昏暗，只听见脚下细沙刷刷的滚动，脸上像有人不断的用沙子扑打。这样的风沙，勘探队员每天要遭遇好几次。吃饭的时候，大家经常要用衣服把头和碗蒙起来才能不吃到沙子。工作上一天，耳朵、鼻子和衣服口袋，到处塞着沙子。
    当风沙弥漫大地，测量员看不见花杆时，他们就缩短距离，一点一点测，沙子扑进测量员的眼睛，擦掉再看仪器；花杆扶不正，工人用两手使劲去扶。风沙一过，太阳又像团火，投射在沙漠上，旷野温度霎时又上升到摄氏四十五度。队员们个个嘴唇裂了，有的人流鼻血，有的人正走着就昏倒在沙漠里。但勘探队员们没有一个人说出一个“苦”字，也没有人要求增加供水量。大家用自己水壶里的水救醒昏倒的同志，又继续前进。就这样，他们把每天测量速度从最初十公里提高到十八公里。
    有一天，测量队员袁秀蓉正拿着花杆工作，狂风骤起，风沙顿时弥漫了他们工作的地区，谁也看不见谁。袁秀蓉便抱着花杆往回跑。她一口气翻了几个沙山，却看不见组里一个人，她又一面向前跑，一面吹哨子，挥动花杆上的红旗联络。但还没有人应声。这时，她才意识到自己迷失了方向，而且累得唇干舌燥，两腿发软，但这个天真无邪的十七岁小姑娘，她没有哭，也没有感到可怕，她心想，组里同志一定会找着她的。她检查了水壶，还有少半壶水，就把花杆插在沙丘顶上，用衣服把头一蒙在花杆下睡觉。到下午黄昏时候，组里同志找到她的时候，大家想她一定要大哭一场。但她却又说又笑地向同志们讲她迷失方向的经过。
          有趣的沙漠生活
    在艰苦的沙漠生活中，勘探队员们充满了乐观主义的情绪。每当朝霞和晚霞来到沙漠的时候，正是队员们出工和收工的时节。大家扛着花杆和仪器，带着一群骆驼，踏着金光灿灿的沙漠，引吭高歌，迎接和结束他们一天的工作。晚间宿营后，空旷的沙漠出现了白色的帐篷，袅袅的炊烟和骆驼群。在这图画般的大自然里，勘探队员们舒坦地坐在松软的沙地上，开始他们每天一个半小时的政治学习。他们逐章学习了青年修养十二讲，讨论资产阶级和无产阶级的生活目的。虽然他们生活在浩瀚荒凉的沙漠世界，他们的思想则和祖国大跃进的脉搏一起跳动。
    奇异的沙漠，常给他们的生活带来许多预料不到的趣事。有时他们身边突然落下一只迷途的小鸟，有时身上又出现了一只不知从何而来的蝇子。大家对这种稀罕之物便展开一场围攻，都以为这是将要出现树林和人家的预兆。但结果只是一场空欢喜。在沙漠里由于没有水洗脸，汗水流过的地方，便粘上一道沙土，每个人的脸都黑一道白一道。大家对面相视，都乐得哈哈大笑。有一天夜里，大家正在沙滩酣睡，突然袭来人们意想不到的一阵大雨。队员们被惊醒之后，从被窝里跳出来喊着：“下雨了，快洗脸！”稀罕的沙漠甘霖，引起了一阵热闹。
    勘探队员们在地质上的发现，比找到地下水还要高兴得多。第二组的队员们在一天下午快要收工时，突然发现前面一座黑沉沉的小山孤零零地耸立在沙漠上。地质队员立即喊着：“同志们加油！前面可能是露头。”大家一听是露头，一个跟一个欢呼着向前跑。到了跟前，果然是一片第三纪的地层露头，这个对解释大沙漠地质结构和含油远景有很大价值的发现，使队员们对自己的工作更加感到光荣，大家欢欣鼓舞地到处采矿样，打电报，给队部报喜。当天晚上这片戈壁上找不到柴做饭，他们虽然吃干馍，喝凉水充饥，但却兴致勃勃地推论大沙漠的地下秘密。
