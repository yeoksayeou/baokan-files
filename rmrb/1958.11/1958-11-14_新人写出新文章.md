Post-Editing Notes

    Newcomers Write New Articles
    In our country, newcomers are constantly emerging. They not only have touching deeds, but also know how to write articles to promote them to others. Their articles present facts specifically, explain principles clearly, and speak in a simple and vivid way. The article by Liu Shuzhen, a female commune member of the People's Commune, is such an example. Articles like this are full in the minds of even those who are illiterate. They just need to talk about it and ask someone to help write it down, and it becomes an article. This article was originally published in the China Youth Daily. We made some minor revisions when we published it. The purpose of publishing it is not only to let readers receive her new ideas, but also to let people learn from her writing style. At the same time, we invite many people like Liu Shuzhen to write such short articles for the newspaper supplement, so that the supplement can become a garden for the people to conduct self-education.

### 新人写出新文章

    新人写出新文章
    在我们国家里，新人不断涌现，他们不仅事迹感人，而且会写文章向人宣传。他们的文章事实摆得具体，道理讲得明白，话说得又朴素又生动。人民公社女社员刘淑珍的文章，就是这样一个例子。像这样的文章，就是不识字的人，也装了满满一肚子，只要说说，请别人帮助记下来就是一篇。这篇文章，原发表在中国青年报上，我们发表时又稍稍作了点修改。发表的意思，除了使读者领受她的新思想以外，还想使人们学一学她的文风，同时请像刘淑珍一样的许多人，都给报纸副刊写这样的短文来。使副刊成为一个人民进行自我教育的园地。
