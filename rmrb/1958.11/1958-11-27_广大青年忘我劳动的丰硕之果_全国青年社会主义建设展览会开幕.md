Xinhua News Agency, November 26th. The National Youth Socialist Construction Exhibition opened in Beijing this afternoon.

This exhibition is part of the Second National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Congress. The more than 5,000 exhibits, displayed in the five pavilions of industry, agriculture, culture and education, children, and the military, are mostly the labor achievements of the youth activists and advanced collectives participating in this congress. From this exhibition, people can see the enormous contributions made by youth on all fronts under the leadership of the Party, resolutely implementing the general line of socialist construction; they can see the noble qualities of selflessness and dedication to the public interest, and the daring communist spirit of the vast youth who are growing up under the Party's guidance.

The exhibition prominently shows that youth are loyal executors of the Party's policies, going wherever the Party points. In the industry pavilion, people can see how young workers actively responded to the Party's call, launching a large-scale iron and steel campaign under the Party's policy of combining the large, medium, and small, and the indigenous and foreign. Of the 60 million people nationwide engaged in large-scale iron and steel production, 36 million were youth. The production competition between young steelworkers in Benxi, Taiyuan, and other places, the high-yield steel records achieved by young people in Henan, Shanxi, and other places, and the various steelmaking and ironmaking equipment such as indigenous blast furnaces and hot blast stoves created and improved by young people in various places are all displayed to people through charts, models, and other means. The industry pavilion also used charts, models, and real objects to show how young people in machinery, electricity, transportation, and coal overcame various difficulties and vigorously supported the steel and machinery, and grain marshals. The models and real objects exhibited in the agriculture pavilion show that young people resolutely implemented the "Eight-Point Charter" for agricultural production and made great contributions in water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, soil improvement, and agricultural tool reform, thereby creating amazing high-yield achievements. Chen Yanli, a Party member, and Feng Fuyao, a League member, from the Heping People's Commune in Xiping County, Henan Province, achieved a high yield of 7,320 catties of wheat per mu. In the water conservancy construction section, there is a model of the Jiudian Gorge Communist Youth League Engineering Section, which shows that its canal line is built on the Jiudian Mountain, 2,300 meters above sea level, and is the most arduous section of the 引洮 [Diversion of the Tao River] project in Gansu Province. After accepting the task of building this section of the project, more than 2,000 young people in Jingyuan County, many of them tied with ropes, hung on cliffs to drill holes and blast huge rocks into the Tao River.

The exhibition also prominently reflects the daring communist spirit of the youth. The achievements of young metallurgical workers in Yunnan Province in refining rare metals, exhibited in the industry pavilion, are one example. Before the rectification campaign, this work was monopolized by a few "experts," who not only did not actively conduct refining experiments, but instead used books to scare young metallurgical workers, saying that rare metal ore bodies were scattered and difficult to refine, and could not be refined without advanced equipment and specialized technicians. However, in less than a year, young metallurgical workers refined many kinds of rare metals.

The exhibition embodies the communist spirit of selflessness and dedication to the public interest of the youth with many real objects. In the industry pavilion, people can see a "Bonus Notice," written to Meng Fanling, a young worker at the Dalian Oil and Fat Chemical Plant. Meng Fanling created water glass detergent, which can save the country more than 200,000 yuan every year. The leadership issued him a bonus of 2,136 yuan in accordance with regulations, but he refused to accept it, saying, "This is what I should do, use the bonus for national construction!" The exhibition also used photos and real objects under the theme of "Ten thousand people teach, the whole nation learns" to show the youth's diligent study and hard work to advance towards culture and science.

Under the Party's cordial care and the specific leadership of the Communist Youth League, China's children also actively participated in socialist construction. In the children's pavilion, the steel and machinery produced by children from all over the country and the exquisite handicrafts made from various waste materials are exhibited; the high-yield achievements they created in their experimental fields; the various ingenious tools they created in eliminating the "four pests"; and the poems, scripts, etc. they created. A series of support-the-front activities by children on the Fujian front lines, such as acting as little nurses and sentries for the Liberation Army uncles, were also displayed through comic strips.

Many pictures and real objects exhibited in the military pavilion show the great achievements made by the youth of the troops under the leadership of the Party in protecting and building the socialist motherland in the past few years. There are models of airplanes, ships, tanks, etc. designed by the youth of the various services and arms of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; and the heroic deeds of the youth activists and advanced collectives of the troops who have made combat achievements in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and on the Fujian coastal defense front. There are also the achievements of young people all over the country actively participating in the militia, holding a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other to realize the combination of labor and military affairs.

This afternoon, Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council, heads of various departments of the Central Government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation, and the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, accompanied by Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, visited the exhibition. Also visiting the exhibition today were some of the youth activists attending the Second National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Congress, and more than 500 youth workers from Beijing.

    广大青年忘我劳动的丰硕之果
    全国青年社会主义建设展览会开幕
    新华社26日讯　全国青年社会主义建设展览会今天下午在北京开幕。
    这个展览会是第二次全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的一个组成部分。分别在工业、农业、文教、少年儿童和军队等五个馆里展出的五千多件展品，绝大部分是参加这次大会的青年积极分子和先进集体的劳动成就。从这个展览会上，人们可以看到全国各个战线上的青年在党的领导下，坚决贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线所作出的巨大贡献；可以看到广大青年们在党的教导下，日益成长起来的大公无私、舍己为公的高贵品质和敢想敢干的共产主义风格。
    展览会突出地显示了青年是党的方针政策的忠实执行者，党指向那里，他们就奔向那里。在工业馆里，人们可以看到青年工人积极响应党的号召，在党的大中小结合、土洋结合的方针下掀起大搞钢铁运动的情况。全国六千万人大搞钢铁，其中青年就有三千六百万。本溪、太原等地青年炼钢工人你追我赶的生产竞赛情况，河南、山西等地青年获得的钢铁高产纪录，以及各地青年创造和改进的土高炉、热风炉等各种炼钢炼铁设备，都被用图表、模型等展现在人们的眼前。工业馆还用图表、模型、实物等向人们展示了机械、电力、交通、煤炭等方面青年如何克服各种困难，大力支援钢、机械、粮食元帅升帐的情况。农业馆里展出的模型和实物，显示了青年们坚决执行农业生产中的“八字宪法”，在水利建设、积肥、改良土壤、改革农具等方面作出了巨大贡献，并因此创造了惊人的丰产成绩。河南省西平县和平人民公社党员陈颜理、团员冯富耀等人就创造了亩产七千三百二十斤小麦的丰产成绩。在水利建设部分，有一个九甸峡共青团工程段模型，这个模型向人们显示出：它的渠线修在拔海二千三百公尺高的九甸山上，是甘肃省引洮工程中最艰险的一段工程。靖远县的二千多名青壮年在接受修建这段工程的任务以后，许多人身系绳索，吊在悬崖上打炮眼，把巨石炸入洮河。
    展览会还突出地反映了青年们敢想敢干的共产主义风格。工业馆里展出的云南省青年冶金人员在提炼稀有金属方面的成就，就是其中的一个例证。整风前，这些工作只有少数“专家”包办，他们不仅不积极进行提炼试验，相反地拿书本吓唬青年冶金人员，说什么稀有金属矿体分散，不易提炼，没有高级设备和专门技术人员根本提炼不出来。可是，不到一年，青年冶金人员们就提炼出了很多种稀有金属。
    青年们大公无私、舍己为公的共产主义精神，这个展览会用许多实物体现了出来。在工业馆，人们可以看到一张“奖金通知单”，是写给大连油脂化学厂青年工人孟范令的。孟范令创造了水玻璃?液，每年可为国家节约二十多万元，领导上按照规定发给他二千一百三十六元奖金，他拒绝接受，他说：“这是我应该做的，把奖金用到国家建设中去吧！”展览会还以“万人教，全民学”为题，通过照片、实物表现了青年们勤学苦练、努力向文化科学进军的情况。
    在党的亲切关怀和共青团的具体带领下，我国少年儿童也积极参加了社会主义建设。在少年儿童馆里，展出了各地少年儿童生产出来的钢铁、机器和用各种废料制成的精美的手工艺品；他们在自己的试验田里创造的丰产成绩；在除“四害”中创造出来的各种灵巧的工具；以及他们创作的诗歌、剧本等。福建前线的少年儿童们给解放军叔叔充当小护士、站岗放哨等一系列的支前活动，也通过连环画等显示了出来。
    军队馆中展出的许多图片和实物，显示了部队青年几年来在党的领导下，在保卫和建设社会主义祖国中取得的巨大成就。这里有中国人民解放军各军种、各兵种的部队青年自己设计的飞机，舰艇、坦克等的模型；有在抗美援朝战争中和在福建海防前线立了战功的部队青年积极分子和先进集体的战斗事迹。还有全国各地青年积极参加民兵，一手拿锄、一手拿枪实现劳武结合的成绩。
    今天下午，国务院秘书长习仲勋，中央各部和中华全国总工会、全国妇女联合会以及人民解放军总政治部的负责人，在共青团中央书记处第一书记胡耀邦等陪同下，参观了这个展览会。今天参观这个展览会的还有出席第二次全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的一部分青年积极分子，和北京市的五百多名青年工作者。
