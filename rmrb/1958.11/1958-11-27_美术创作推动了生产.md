    Art Creation Promotes Production
    Gao Maohai, Farmer of Xiyang, Shanxi
    I joined the Eighth Route Army at the age of thirteen and was wounded nine times. In 1949, I returned home as a second-class disabled veteran. What did I want to do? The Party nurtured me to this extent, and I should serve the people more. I loved drawing since I was a child and drew some in the army, but without guidance, I just drew on my own. So after returning to the village, I drew some pictures in the village to support propaganda. Later, I even made my own slide projector, combining it with local conditions, drawing and performing at the same time, which was very popular among the masses.
    This spring, the township Party committee proposed to beautify the new socialist countryside and asked our art group to paint murals, to be completed in ten days. As a result, the masses helped us whitewash the walls, make colors, and provide lighting. We painted at night without taking up labor time, and completed it in three days. After the murals were finished, we mobilized paper cutting, and every family put paper-cut window decorations on their windows. The masses were very enthusiastic and composed a quick-clapper rhyme saying: Cut well, cut carefully, paper cutting is also for production, cut out tractors to plow the fields well, cut out reservoirs to irrigate the crops, cut out models to set an example, cut out hens to lay eggs well. Even when sleeping on the kang, you are educated.
    After the Great Leap Forward, in conjunction with the new situation, we started using small easels in the fields. We made many paper blackboards and drew pictures on the spot for propaganda. In May and June, during the construction of the reservoir, a comrade named Li Chengyuan was very active, carrying a lot and running fast. During the break, our art group drew pictures to praise him, and suddenly many small field newspapers were placed around him. His enthusiasm became even greater, and he proposed to compete with the young men, which motivated everyone.
   A comrade pretended to be sick and did not go to work. I discussed with Li Xifan of the art group and drew a "fake patient" and put it in front of his door. When he came out and saw it, he turned around, picked up his hoe, and went to the field, saying: The small newspaper cured my illness. The masses said in a rhyme: Small newspaper, really good, can handle anything, serves as both doctor and leader.
    The commune arranged production tasks every ten days. Originally, a meeting was required, but I thought that meetings wasted a lot of time, so I thought of using paintings to replace them. I consulted with the leaders and drew a large table at the entrance of the village, writing the date, location, and drawing labor images such as carrying fertilizer and hoeing the fields. This way, the production tasks were announced, and the masses called it "Knowing the Next Ten Days Early," saying "Look at 'Knowing the Next Ten Days Early,' production is not confused, save meeting time, and add an extra hour to production."
    When running the public canteen, many households shouted that there was a shortage of food, saying that there was no stored grain to give to the canteen. I drew a picture of "Many People Adding Fuel to the Fire" to promote the ten major benefits of the public canteen. Li Guanri, who originally shouted that there was a shortage of food, saw it and took out the stored grain, saying: Actually, nothing is lacking, what is lacking is socialist ideological education. We immediately drew "What is Lacking is Socialist Ideological Education," which resulted in food-short households taking out their grain one after another. In one night, there were more than 30,000 catties. We also drew congratulatory messages for them, congratulating them on the emergence of their socialist ideology.

    美术创作推动了生产
    山西昔阳农民　高毛孩
    我十三岁参加八路军，前后负过九次伤，1949年以二等乙级残废复员回家，我想干点啥呢？党培养我到这大，总要为人民多服点务。我从小就爱画画，在部队也画过一些，没人指导就自己画，所以回村后我就在村里画些画来配合宣传。后来我还自己制造幻灯机，结合当地情况，随画随演，很受群众欢迎。
    今春，乡党委提出美化社会主义新农村，要我们美术组画墙画，十天完成。结果群众帮我们粉墙做颜色点灯，我们不占劳动时间连夜画，三天就完成。墙画完了，我们又发动剪纸，每家窗纸上都贴上了窗花，群众兴致很高，编快板说：好好剪，细细剪，剪纸也是为生产，剪下拖拉机好耕地，剪下水库浇庄田，剪下模范立榜样，剪下母鸡好下蛋。睡在炕上也受教育。
    大跃进以后，结合新形势，我们弄起了地头小画板。做许多纸黑板，在地头随时画画宣传。5、6月间修水库，有个同志叫李成元，十分积极，担得多跑得快。在休息时我们美术组一齐画画表扬他，一下子好多块地头小画报都插在他周围，他的干劲更大了，提出要和小伙子竞赛，带动了大家。
  有个同志装病不出工，我和美术组李喜范商量，画了个“假病人”插到他门口去，他出来一看，回身便扛锄下地，说：小画报给我把病治好了。群众顺口溜说道：小画报，真正好，任甚事情能办了，又顶医生，又当领导。
    社里每十天安排一次生产任务，原来要开会，我看开会很费时间，就想法用画来代替。和领导商量，在村头画一个大表格，写明日期、地点，画上担肥、锄地等劳动形象，这样来公布生产任务，群众起名叫“十天早知道”，说“看看十天早知道，生产不迷窍，省下开会工，生产加点钟”。
    办公共食堂时，有好多户大喊缺粮，说没有存粮可给食堂，我画了一张“大家拾柴火焰高”宣传公共食堂十大好处，原来喊缺粮的李观日看了，便把存粮拿了出来，说：其实什么都不缺，缺的是社会主义思想教育。我们又马上画了“缺的是社会主义思想教育”，结果使缺粮户都纷纷拿出粮食来，一夜共有三万多斤。我们又给他们画喜报，祝贺他们的社会主义思想出现。
