Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd: Premier Zhou Enlai held a grand banquet tonight, warmly welcoming the Korean government delegation headed by Premier Kim Il-sung. Tonight's banquet once again demonstrated that the internationalist friendship forged between the two peoples with blood is forever invincible, and that the two peoples will always be close comrades-in-arms fighting side by side in the common struggle against imperialism.

Premier Zhou Enlai and Premier Kim Il-sung spoke at the banquet one after another, unanimously expressing mutual support for the sacred cause of the reunification and territorial integrity of their respective countries, and jointly opposing the aggressive conspiracies of U.S. imperialism, reflecting the firm will of the two peoples to work together to tighten the noose around the neck of U.S. imperialism.

All members of the Korean military delegation and the Korean art troupe attended the banquet.

On the rostrum of the banquet hall were hung the national flags of China and Korea, and below the flags was a huge banner with golden characters: "Long Live Sino-Korean Friendship." Twenty-six huge red silk banners, each several feet long, decorated the carved beams and painted rafters of the hall, hanging from the roof all the way to the ground. In the banquet hall, filled with flowers and evergreen palm trees, more than six hundred Chinese and foreign guests were all smiles, frequently raising their glasses to congratulate the everlasting Sino-Korean friendship.

In his speech, Premier Zhou Enlai warmly said that the visit of Premier Kim Il-sung and all the distinguished Korean guests was a great encouragement to the Chinese people. He excitedly praised the friendship forged by the blood of the Chinese and Korean peoples as the most sublime friendship based on Marxism-Leninism, and pointed out that the power generated by this friendship is invincible!

On behalf of the Chinese people, Premier Zhou sincerely thanked the Korean Workers' Party, the government, and the entire Korean people, headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, for their strong support and meticulous care for the Chinese People's Volunteers over the past eight years, and thanked the Korean people for their noble internationalist spirit.

In his speech, he also warmly praised the heroic spirit of the Korean people in accelerating socialist construction by leaping on the Chollima horse. He said, "The Chinese people cheer for the great achievements already made by the fraternal Korean people, and wish them even greater achievements."

After pointing out that the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea had opened up a new path for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, Premier Zhou severely condemned the U.S. imperialists for consistently refusing to withdraw their invading troops from Korea and obstructing the Korean people from peacefully reunifying their country. He pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' "practice of antagonizing the entire Korean people can only result in tightening the noose around their own necks."

Premier Zhou finally emphasized: "Now, the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops are not only entrenched in southern Korea, but also refuse to leave Taiwan. It attempts to continue to occupy Japan and, using Japan as a base, continues to threaten the Chinese and Korean peoples from southern Korea and Taiwan and Penghu. This is a war plan to enslave Japan, split Korea, and create two Chinas. This plan of the U.S. imperialists, which looks very arrogant, is actually self-defeating, throwing itself into the net of heaven and earth where the people of Eastern countries extinguish imperialist aggressors. There is no doubt that China's Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu must be liberated, and the three thousand miles of magnificent rivers and mountains of Korea must be unified. The American paper tiger, which has been exposed by the heroic Korean and Chinese people, cannot scare anyone."

The entire audience welcomed Premier Kim Il-sung's speech at the banquet with thunderous applause. Premier Kim Il-sung excitedly said: "The friendship between our two peoples has a long history and is forged with blood." "In the big family of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, our two peoples are closely united on the basis of proletarian internationalism, supporting and helping each other. This friendship is an invincible force."

Premier Kim Il-sung said: "The Chinese People's Volunteers' initiative to withdraw from Korea has opened up a new situation for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and for easing the tension in the Far East." The Premier emphasized: "The U.S. military must immediately withdraw from Korea. Only when the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops withdraw from South Korea can the peaceful reunification of Korea be realized, the peace of Korea be consolidated, and the Korean issue must be resolved peacefully by the Korean people themselves on a democratic basis without any foreign interference."

The Premier severely condemned the new provocative activities of the U.S. imperialists in the Taiwan Strait against the Chinese people.

He warned the U.S. imperialists: "The Korean people believe that any act of aggression against the Chinese people is a threat to the Korean people; the Korean people resolutely condemn the war-mongering conspiracies of U.S. imperialism." "In the struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and in defense of peace, the Korean people will always stand firmly with the Chinese people."

Premier Kim Il-sung said: "The people of Korea and China will always be brothers cooperating with each other and comrades-in-arms sharing the same destiny on the road to achieving the same goals of peace and socialism." "We will do our utmost to consolidate the fighting friendship with the Chinese people."

Premier Kim Il-sung finally warmly congratulated the fraternal Chinese people on achieving even greater success in the future cause of building socialism.

After the speeches by the Premier and the Prime Minister, the band played the national anthems of Korea and China. Their speeches, full of friendly affection, aroused bursts of warm applause in the joyful banquet hall. All Chinese and foreign guests unanimously stood up and raised their glasses to congratulate the friendly cooperation between China and Korea, to congratulate the unity of the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to congratulate world peace.

Tonight, Vice Premiers Peng Dehuai, He Long, Chen Yi, and Nie Rongzhen, Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, and Cheng Qian, Vice Chairman Zhang Zhizhong of the National Defense Council, Vice Chairman Li Siguang of the CPPCC, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wentian, President Li Dequan of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association, Generals Yang Yong and Wang Ping, Chinese Ambassador to Korea Qiao Xiaoguang and others attended the banquet.

At the banquet, the Volunteers' Cultural Troupe and male and female actors from the capital performed many Korean songs and dances and Chinese song, dance, and acrobatics programs for the distinguished Korean guests. Famous Peking Opera actors Tan Fuying and Qiu Shengrong performed Peking Opera excerpts.

Before the banquet began, a grand reception was held. At the reception, Premier Zhou Enlai introduced Premier Kim Il-sung and all the distinguished Korean guests to the heads of various departments of our national organs, various people's organizations, and various democratic parties, to the senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and to people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life, including workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants. At the same time, he also met the envoys of various countries stationed in China. The scene was very moving. For a full half hour, the reception hall resounded with rhythmic applause of welcome. Premier Kim Il-sung shook hands with the welcomers with a smile and had cordial conversations with people from all walks of life in China in Chinese. Some representatives attending the National Congress of Activists in Socialist Construction of Youth presented the medals they had won in their work to Premier Kim Il-sung.

The grand reception and banquet continued for a full four hours in an atmosphere full of joy. (Attached picture)

    人人欢笑　频频举杯  祝贺万古长青的中朝友谊
    周总理盛宴欢迎朝鲜贵宾
    周恩来总理和金日成首相表示互相支持两国人民的祖国统一和领土完整，同心协力拉紧套在美帝国主义脖子上的绞索
    新华社22日讯  周恩来总理今晚举行盛大宴会，热烈欢迎以金日成首相为首的朝鲜政府代表团。今晚的宴会再次显示出两国人民用鲜血结成的国际主义友谊是永远不可战胜的，两国人民在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中永远是并肩作战的亲密战友。
    周恩来总理和金日成首相在宴会上先后讲话，他们一致表示互相支持两国人民自己的祖国统一和领土完整的神圣事业，共同反对美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，反映了两国人民同心协力拉紧套在美帝国主义脖子上的绞索的坚决意志。
    朝鲜军事代表团和朝鲜艺术团全体人员都出席了宴会。
    宴会大厅的主席台上高悬着中朝两国国旗，国旗下面是巨大的横幅金字标语：“中朝友谊万岁”。二十六面几丈长的巨幅红绸装饰在大厅里的雕梁画栋上，从屋顶一直垂到地面。在满布鲜花和常青棕榈的宴会大厅里，六百多位中外来宾人人欢笑，频频举杯，祝贺万古长青的中朝友谊。
    周恩来总理在讲话中热情地说，金日成首相和全体朝鲜贵宾的访问是对中国人民的一个莫大的鼓舞，他兴奋地赞颂中朝人民用鲜血凝成的友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义基础上的最崇高的友谊，并指出这种友谊所产生的力量是不可战胜的！
    周总理代表中国人民衷心地感谢以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党、政府和全体朝鲜人民在过去八年中对中国人民志愿军的大力支援和无微不至的关怀，感谢朝鲜人民高贵的国际主义精神。
    他在讲话中还热烈地赞扬了朝鲜人民跨上千里马加速社会主义建设的豪迈气概。他说：“中国人民为兄弟的朝鲜人民已经取得的巨大成就而欢呼，并且预祝他们取得更大的成就。”
    周总理在指出中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜为和平解决朝鲜问题开辟了新的道路以后，严厉地谴责了美帝国主义始终拒绝从朝鲜撤出侵略军队，并且阻挠朝鲜人民和平统一自己的国家的侵略行为。他指出美帝国主义“不惜同全体朝鲜人民为敌的做法，其结果只能是把绞索更紧地套在自己的脖子上”。
    周总理最后强调指出：“现在，美帝国主义的侵略部队不仅盘据着朝鲜南部，而且还赖在台湾不走。它企图继续占领日本，并且以日本为基地，从朝鲜南部和台湾澎湖继续威胁中朝两国人民，这是一个奴役日本，分裂朝鲜、制造两个中国的战争计划。美帝国主义这套计划，看起来好像是很狂妄、其实是自投罗网，自己投身到东方各国人民扑灭帝国主义侵略者的天罗地网里。没有任何疑问，中国的台、澎、金、马一定要解放，朝鲜的三千里壮丽河山一定要统一。已经被英勇的朝中人民戳穿了的美国纸老虎，是吓不倒任何人的。”
    全场以雷鸣般的掌声欢迎金日成首相在宴会上讲话。金日成首相兴奋地说：“我们两国人民之间的友谊有着悠久的历史，并且是由鲜血凝结而成的。”“我们两国人民在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大家庭里，在无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上，紧紧地团结在一起，互相支持和互相援助。这种友谊是战无不胜的力量。”
    金日成首相说：“中国人民志愿军主动撤出朝鲜，为朝鲜问题的和平解决，为缓和远东的紧张局势，打开了新的局面。”首相强调指出：“美军必须立即撤出朝鲜，只有美帝国主义侵略军队撤出南朝鲜，朝鲜的和平统一才能得到实现，朝鲜的和平才能得到巩固，朝鲜问题，必须在没有任何外国干涉的条件下，在民主基础上，由朝鲜人民自己和平解决。”
    首相严厉地谴责美帝国主义者在台湾海峡进行的反对中国人民的新的挑衅活动。
    他警告美帝国主义者：“朝鲜人民认为，任何反对中国人民的侵略行为，都是对朝鲜人民的威胁；朝鲜人民坚决谴责美帝国主义的战争挑拨阴谋。”“在反对美帝国主义的侵略和维护和平的斗争中，朝鲜人民将永远同中国人民坚定地站在一起。”
    金日成首相说：“朝中两国人民，在实现和平和社会主义的同一目的的道路上，永远是互相合作的兄弟，永远是共命运的战友。”“我们为了巩固同中国人民的战斗友谊，将竭尽自己的全部力量。”
    金日成首相最后热烈地祝贺兄弟般的中国人民在建设社会主义的今后事业中取得更大的成就。
    总理和首相讲话以后，乐队高奏朝中两国国歌。他们充满友谊深情的讲话，在欢乐的宴会大厅中激起了一阵又一阵的热烈掌声，全体中外来宾一致起立举杯，祝贺中朝两国的友好合作，祝贺以苏联为首的伟大社会主义阵营的团结，祝贺世界和平。
    今晚，彭德怀、贺龙、陈毅、聂荣臻副总理，李济深、沈钧儒、郭沫若、程潜副委员长，国防委员会张治中副主席，政协李四光副主席，外交部张闻天副部长，中朝友好协会李德全会长，杨勇上将、王平上将，中国驻朝鲜大使乔晓光等都出席了宴会。
    宴会上，志愿军文工团和首都的男女演员们为朝鲜贵宾表演了许多朝鲜歌舞和中国的歌舞杂技节目。著名京剧演员谭富英和裘盛戎表演了京剧清唱。
    宴会开始以前，举行了盛大的酒会。在酒会上，周恩来总理介绍金日成首相和全体朝鲜贵宾会见了我国国家机关各部门、各人民团体、各民主党派的负责人，会见了中国人民解放军的高级将领和工农兵学商各族各界人士，同时还会见了各国驻中国的使节。会见的时候，情景非常动人，在整整半个小时的时间内，酒会大厅里一直响彻着有节奏的欢迎掌声。金日成首相含笑同欢迎者握手，并用中国话同中国各方面的人士进行亲切交谈。出席全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的一些代表，把自己在劳动中获得的奖章献给了金日成首相。
    盛大的酒会和宴会一直在充满欢乐的气氛中进行了整整四个小时。（附图片）
