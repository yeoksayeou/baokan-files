Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 18th: During the mass steelmaking movement, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other places have successively contributed many effective prescriptions for treating scalds, burns, heatstroke and other injuries and illnesses. These prescriptions have played a significant role in treating injuries and illnesses caused by high temperatures, and have been praised by patients and relevant leading organizations.

    Chen Qizhou, the director of the Acupuncture Research Department of the Fujian Provincial Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, recently contributed a proven prescription for treating burns that has successfully treated more than 100 patients with burns covering 10% to 40% of their bodies. The prescriptions for treating heatstroke from high-temperature operations, such as the "Seven Flavor Elixir" and "Eye-drop Pellet" contributed by Chen Huanzhang, an old traditional Chinese medicine practitioner in Xiamen, have also achieved a cure rate of over 90%. The proven prescriptions for treating scalds, such as "Golden Yellow Ointment" and "Barley Ointment" contributed by Lin Xiaode and Chen Tinghuang, physicians at Xiamen Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, can shorten the treatment period by half compared to Western medicine for the same scalds.
