Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 28th: The Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Health, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions convened the Steel Production Labor Protection Work Conference and the Factory Dust Prevention and Cooling On-site Experience Exchange Conference in Shanghai from the 15th to the 25th.

More than 600 representatives from labor, health, and industrial departments, trade union organizations, factories and mines, scientific research units, and universities from various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions attended the meeting.

Since the whole Party and all the people started running the iron and steel industry on a large scale, millions of steel production teams across the country have been scattered in the mountains, villages, and cities, and they have created unprecedented miracles with soaring enthusiasm. In the face of this vigorous mass movement, labor protection work must also adopt the method of mass movement to quickly keep up with the development of the situation. This meeting focused on exchanging experiences in this area. Many local Party committees took the lead, leading cadres took the initiative, and conscientiously implemented the principle of "managing production and managing safety, everyone managing production, everyone managing safety," and carried out mass labor protection work. Some areas selected one or two safety officers from each production team to conduct pre-shift inspections and post-shift summaries, achieving mass mutual supervision. Some areas organized roving technical guidance groups and safety and hygiene inspection guidance groups combining native and foreign experts. Some opened short-term labor protection training courses and formulated simple and clear safety production technical operating procedures to strengthen workers' education in safety production knowledge. Many medical personnel also went down to the countryside and mountains, camping in the construction sites, and launched patriotic health campaigns on the construction sites, ensuring that wherever there were steel workers, there were medical personnel.

The meeting believes that to do a good job in the current labor protection work, it is also necessary to implement the principle of "small-scale, indigenous groups," mobilize the masses, ask everyone to come up with ideas, and vigorously carry out technical innovation. The experience exchanged at this meeting shows that the masses are most familiar with production and can also propose practical labor protection methods.

The meeting also requested that various localities compile and publish some concise and easy-to-understand safety production information and other reading materials in order to more widely carry out the propaganda and education of safety production ideology and safety technical knowledge to the steel army.

This newspaper reports that in the process of the great victory of the steel production movement, the Party committees in many places have achieved "the greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more they care about the safety and health of the masses." Shandong, Henan, Zhejiang, Jilin, Shanxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Shanghai, Beijing and other provinces and cities have taken many safety production measures in the steel production movement, and formulated and issued safety and health information and regulations for steelmaking, ironmaking, and small coal mine mining. In its instructions on strengthening medical and health work in people's communes and steel construction sites, Hunan Province specifically proposed that attention must be paid to labor protection for women. Baotou City also formulated measures for distributing protective equipment. Some areas also held on-site experience exchange meetings on safety and health to promote various effective labor protection methods.

Various places have created many valuable experiences in safety production. Workers in the Xinyang Special District of Henan who crushed ore came up with many indigenous methods, such as using grass ropes to weave circles with handles, installing small rakes made of iron wire on them, hitting on the front side and raking on the reverse side, which not only did not hurt their hands, but also prevented flying stones, and was fast and did not hurt people. Many small coal mines do not have gas detectors, so workers bring a few canaries into the pits, and from the canaries' expressions, they can measure the amount of gas. The Technical Revolution Youth Shock Brigade of the Nanjing Puzhen Locomotive Factory created a trapezoidal electric or hand-cranked charging device for indigenous blast furnaces, used waste materials to make crushers and ore washing machines, and used electric drills to make mixers. The crusher alone not only reduced labor intensity and saved labor, but also increased labor efficiency by 20% to 30%. The Nanjing Qinhuai Ironmaking Plant mobilized the masses, liberated their minds, and created an indigenous blast furnace pole-carrying charging machine, which solved the problem of manual charging "three dragons" (three rows of people carrying ore, coke, and limestone), which not only prevented carbon monoxide poisoning accidents, but also greatly saved labor, reducing the number of people per furnace from 150 to eight. The Henan Red Flag Ironmaking Plant vigorously carried out technical revolution and created 78 kinds of indigenous safety production methods such as the aerial runway-style stone transportation method and the hand-cranked drop hammer stone crusher. In order to prevent burns, the Party Committee Secretary of the Qingdao Tool Factory personally presided over the creation of the safety education form of pre-furnace meetings. Some areas have created sloganized and poeticized safety production teaching materials.

These facts prove that many safety production methods created by workers not only avoid accidents and ensure the health and safety of the steel army, but also improve operating methods and increase labor efficiency, which has played a positive and important role in the development of the steel production movement.

    保护钢铁大军安全生产
    劳动保护工作会议号召“人人管生产人人管安全”
    各地创造的许多“土办法”既保证安全又提高效率
    据新华社上海28日电　劳动部、卫生部、全国总工会从15日到25日在上海召开了钢铁生产劳动保护工作会议和工厂防尘降温现场经验交流会议。
    出席这次会议的有各省、市、自治区劳动、卫生、工业部门，工会组织，厂矿企业，科学研究单位以及大专学校等代表六百多人。
    全党全民大办钢铁工业以来，全国千百万钢铁生产队伍散布在山区、乡村和城市的各个角落，他们干劲冲天，已经创造了史无前例的奇迹。在这轰轰烈烈的群众运动面前，劳动保护工作也必须采取群众运动的方法，迅速跟上形势的发展。这次会议着重交流了这方面的经验。许多地区党委挂帅，领导干部亲自动手，认真地贯彻了“管生产管安全，人人管生产，人人管安全”的原则，开展了群众性的劳动保护工作。有的地区在各生产班组中，挑选一人到二人做安全员，班前检查，班后总结，做到了群众性互相监督。有的地区组织了土洋专家结合的巡回技术指导小组和安全卫生检查指导小组。有的开办了劳动保护短期训练班，制订了简单明确的安全生产技术操作规程，对工人加强安全生产知识的教育。许多医务人员也都下乡上山，到工地安营下寨，开展工地爱国卫生运动，做到了哪儿有炼钢工人，哪儿就有医务人员。
    会议认为，要做好当前的劳动保护工作，也必须贯彻“小土群”的方针，发动群众，大家想办法，大闹技术革新。这次会上交流的经验表明，群众最熟悉生产，也最能提出切实可行的劳动保护办法。
    这次会议还要求各地编辑出版一些简明易懂的安全生产须知等读物，以便更普遍地向钢铁大军进行安全生产思想和安全技术知识的宣传教育工作。
    本报讯　在钢铁生产运动取得伟大胜利的过程中，许多地方的党委做到了“群众干劲越大，越关心群众的安全和健康。”山东、河南、浙江、吉林、山西、广东、广西、上海、北京等省市均在钢铁生产运动中采取了不少安全生产的措施，制订和颁发了炼钢炼铁、开采小煤窑等安全卫生须知和规定。湖南省在关于加强人民公社和钢铁工地医疗卫生工作的指示中，还特别提出必须注意对妇女的劳动保护。包头市还制订了发放防护用品的办法。有的地区还召开了安全卫生的现场经验交流会议，推广各种行之有效的劳动保护办法。
    各地在安全生产方面已创造了很多宝贵经验。河南信阳专区破碎矿石的工人想了许多土办法，如用草绳编成带把的圆圈，上边装上用铁丝制的小耙，正面打，反面耙，既不磨手，也防止了飞石，又快又不伤人。许多小煤窑没有瓦斯测定器，工人就带几只黄雀到坑井里去，从黄雀的神态中，便可测定瓦斯的多少。南京浦镇机车厂的技术革命青年突击队创造了土高炉梯形电动或手摇的加料装置，利用废料制成破碎机、洗矿石机，并利用电钻制成了搅拌机。只破碎机一项，不仅减轻了劳动强度，节省了劳动力，而且提高了劳动效率20％—30％。南京秦淮炼铁厂发动群众，解放思想，创造了土高炉运杆加料机，解决了人工加料“三条龙”（三排人搬矿石、焦炭和石灰石）的问题，不仅防止了一氧化炭中毒事故，而且大大节省了劳动力，由原来每座炉一百五十人减少到八个人。河南红旗炼铁厂大闹技术革命，创造了空中跑道式运石法、手摇吊锤破石器等七十八种安全生产的土办法。青岛工具制造厂为了防止烫伤事故，党委书记亲自主持创造了炉前会的安全教育形式。有的地区创造了口号化、诗歌化的安全生产教材。
    这些事实证明，工人中间创造的许多安全生产的土办法，不仅避免了发生事故，保证钢铁大军的健康和安全，还改进了操作方法，提高了劳动效率，对钢铁生产运动的开展起了积极的重要的作用。
