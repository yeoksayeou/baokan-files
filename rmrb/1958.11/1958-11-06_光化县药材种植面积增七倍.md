Guanghua County, Hubei Province, is a county mainly engaged in grain and cotton production. Historically, it only produced a few wild medicinal materials such as whole scorpions, earthworms, and pinellia, and no one had ever cultivated domestic medicinal materials.

In 1957, Guanghua County began trial planting of medicinal materials. Within one year, it cultivated twelve kinds of plant medicinal materials, including rehmannia, safflower, angelica, two ugly, white beans, ophiopogon japonicus, atractylodes macrocephala, chrysanthemum, yam, achyranthes bidentata, and eucommia ulmoides, covering an area of ​​150 mu. At the beginning of this year, the planting area of ​​medicinal materials had increased to 1,231 mu. The yield per unit area of ​​medicinal materials reached the general level, and the quality also reached the standard of "authentic" goods.

At the beginning of the introduction, the county first adopted demonstrative trial planting. After one production period, the seventeen mu of rehmannia planted in the county yielded more than 40,000 jin, with an average yield of more than 2,000 jin per mu, generating an income of 30,000 yuan. This fact greatly enlightened the farmers. It shows that Guanghua County's soil, climate, and natural conditions are entirely suitable for the production of medicinal materials, and the yield and quality are not lower than those of the main producing areas in the past.

Practice has proven that as long as we resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party and government, follow the mass line, break superstitions, and grain and cotton producing areas can also develop medicinal material production.

    光化县药材种植面积增七倍
    湖北省光化县是以粮棉生产为主的县份，历来在药材方面只出产全虫、土元、半夏等几种野生药材，家生药材从没有人培植过。
    1957年光化县开始试种药材，一年内共栽培了生地、红花、白芷、二丑、白豆、麦冬、白术、菊花、山药、牛夕、杜仲等十二种植物药材，占耕地面积一百五十亩，今年年初药材的种植面积已增至一千二百三十一亩，药材单位面积达到一般水平，质量也达到了“道地”货标准。
    开始引种时，该县先采取示范性的试种。经过一个生产期后，全县试种的十七亩生地，产量竟达四万多斤，亩产平均超过两千斤，收入三万元。这一事实对农民启发很大，它说明光化县的土质、气候和自然条件完全适合药材生产，产量和质量不低于过去主要产区。
    实践证明：只要坚决依靠党政领导，走群众路线，破除迷信，棉粮产区同样能发展药材生产。
