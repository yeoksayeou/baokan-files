    The implementation of a supply system in all primary schools in Fan County ensures that every school-age child, regardless of their family's economic situation, has the opportunity to receive primary education. This approach will greatly facilitate the universalization of primary education. The children of the working people will no longer be excluded from the school gates, and the difference between mental and physical labor will be eliminated at a higher speed.

    The implementation of a boarding system in all primary schools in Fan County, achieving collectivized food and lodging, allows young children to live a collective and equal life of learning and labor from an early age, accelerating the growth of communist ideology in young children. This is worth promoting. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out during his inspection of the Henan People's Commune in September that primary schools should develop towards student boarding. Social education should be emphasized for children, and the focus should not be on family education. Fan County's approach is an important step in shifting the focus to social education. On this basis, if the school's teachers, on the one hand, lead by example, and on the other hand, pay attention to guidance, seize specific activities, and conduct communist education for young children, then this generation of young children will be cultivated into healthy communist new people.

    The collectivization of school food and lodging, with the school bearing the main responsibility for educating children, makes it more convenient for students' parents to engage in labor. At present, industrial and agricultural production is extremely tense, and factories and rural areas have achieved combat-oriented production, collectivized life, and militarized action. After young children enter nurseries, what parents worry about are the underage primary school students. They urgently need the care and education of adults. When parents go out to work, study, or drill intensively, the children at home may not rest on time, quarrel, play with fire... This makes their parents' minds preoccupied with two things, and they cannot concentrate on participating in production labor, cultural learning, and military training. The collectivization of school food and lodging, taking on the main responsibility for educating children, will enable the commune's production and other aspects to achieve greater leaps forward.

    The practice of Fan County in Shandong is a progressive measure for the activities of our country's communes and education. In this change, the school's faculty and staff must, with a high sense of responsibility, care for the students like parents, from their studies to their games, from their thoughts to their health. Any thought of fearing trouble and simplistic management will bring losses to the students, parents, and the commune. At this time, the commune's Party committee must grasp the leadership of the school's work, appropriately arrange necessary staff for the school, summarize the work in a timely manner, and disseminate experience, so that the practice of collectivizing school food and lodging can be continuously improved.

### 小学住校供给制好得很

    小学住校供给制好得很
    范县全县小学实行供给制，让每个学龄儿童，不问家庭经济条件，都有受小学教育的机会。这种作法，将大大有利于普及小学教育。劳动人民的子女，再也不会被摈弃在学校大门之外，脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别，将在更高的速度下被消灭。
    范县全县小学还实行了住校制，做到了食宿集体化，使少年儿童在幼年时代就过着集体的平等的学习和劳动的生活，加速少年儿童共产主义思想的成长。这是值得提倡的。刘少奇同志在9月间视察河南人民公社时指出：小学要向学生住校方面发展。对小孩子要强调社会教育，不能把重点放在家庭教育上。范县的办法，正是把重点转向社会教育的重要的一步。在这个基础上，如果学校的教师一面以身作则，一面注意引导，抓住具体活动，向少年儿童们进行共产主义教育，那么这一代少年儿童将被培养成健康的共产主义新人。
    学校食宿集体化，把教育儿童的主要责任由学校负担起来，这就更便利于学生家长从事于劳动。目前，工农业生产极为紧张，工厂、农村已生产战斗化、生活集体化、行动军事化。幼儿进入托儿所以后，父母亲所担心的就是未成年的小学生，他们极需要成年人的关怀和教育，家长出门去紧张地劳动、学习或操练，孩子们在家有可能不按时休息、吵架、玩火……。这就使他们的父母一心挂两头，不能专心一意地参加生产劳动、文化学习和军事操练。学校食宿集体化，担负起教育儿童的主要责任，将使公社的生产等方面得到更大的跃进。
    山东范县的作法是我国公社活动和教育事业的进步措施。在这一变革中，学校的教职员，必须以高度的责任心，像父母一样，从学生的学习到游戏，从学生的思想到健康，要无微不至的关怀他们。任何怕麻烦的思想、简单化的管理都将给学生、给家长、给公社带来损失。在这个时候，公社党委必须抓紧对学校工作的领导，适当地给学校安排必要的工作人员，及时总结工作，传播经验，要使学校食宿集体化的作法得到不断的改进。
