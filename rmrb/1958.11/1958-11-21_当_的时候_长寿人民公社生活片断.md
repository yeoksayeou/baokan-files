When…

Fragments of Life in Changshou People's Commune

The People's Commune is truly good, its benefits are countless;
The elderly enter the Houses of Happiness, where food, clothing, housing, and transportation are well taken care of;
Children go to kindergartens, where they sing and dance with laughter;
Women about to give birth to babies receive excellent care in the maternity hospitals;
Young people reach their marriageable age, and grand ceremonies are held;
When one has sores or falls ill, the rural hospital provides treatment;
When relatives and friends come to visit, the canteen offers warm hospitality;
Everyone enjoys abundant food and clothing, the People's Commune is truly good.

This is a doggerel sung by members of the Changshou People's Commune in Pingjiang County, Hunan, praising their good life. Indeed, although this commune was established not long ago, it has already set up Houses of Happiness, kindergartens, maternity hospitals, and clinics at the brigade level. There is also a rural hospital within the commune. The members feel convenient and satisfied everywhere.

When Getting Married

On the evening of October 19th, the moon hung diagonally in the sky. The hall of the Third Brigade was exceptionally brightly lit. Newly pasted portraits of Chairman Mao adorned the walls, flanked by bright red national flags. A couplet was posted at the entrance: "Run the People's Commune Well, Build Happy Families."

It turned out that Liu Lanxiang and Hu Tinong, and Li Yuanhui and Hong Guisheng, two pairs of young men and women, were holding their wedding ceremony. Men, women, old, and young, all walked here one after another. This was the first wedding held since the establishment of the commune. The four young people stood on the stage, and everyone's eyes were on them. At this moment, a member suggested, "Let them talk about how they fell in love." This was immediately supported by all the members. The first one to be pushed to the center was the female hero, platoon leader Liu Lanxiang. She said, "We built our feelings through labor..." As soon as she finished speaking, the laughter and applause of the members, mixed with the sound of gongs and drums, made the whole room boil. Immediately, recreational activities began, including dances by elementary school students, songs by militiamen... It was very lively.

Standing next to her, the young woman Zhou Laixiang glanced at her fiancé, implying, "When we get married next year, it will be even more lively!"

More than a dozen elderly people from the Houses of Happiness also attended the wedding, each smiling from ear to ear. Among them, 63-year-old Bi Ganniang said with great emotion, "Now getting married is both lively and saves money, it's really great. In the past, as a bride, one had to be well-behaved, not showing one's teeth when smiling, not speaking loudly, and walking with small embroidered steps. Being a bride for a day was really torture." Before she could finish speaking, Aunt Wu Fang interjected, "If I had been born thirty years later, wouldn't I also be able to talk about how I fell in love, sing a song..." This sentence made everyone around laugh heartily.

When Visitors Arrive

On October 19th, Zhou Yongsheng's mother-in-law, Wu Xiangan, along with more than a dozen women, came to Changshou Commune to visit the women's fertilizer factory. Wu Xiangan took the opportunity to visit her son-in-law and daughter, whom she had not seen for three years. When she arrived at Zhou Yongsheng's house, they were not there. Just as she was about to leave, she happened to meet the canteen manager, who invited her to the canteen, offering tea and washing water, treating her very attentively. When the commune members returned for lunch, Zhou Yongsheng and his wife were overjoyed to see her. But it was time for the canteen to serve meals, and there was no time to add dishes. What to do? Just as they were in a dilemma, the canteen manager came over and invited them to eat, and four dishes were placed on the table. The manager said kindly, "The commune Party committee studied this last night. In order to take care of the commune members' visitors, the canteen will prepare some meat dishes every day, so it is convenient to add dishes. We also have guest rooms prepared, so guests can stay overnight." The mother-in-law, Wu Xiangan, said, "The Party does things by seeing through people's hearts, always thinking of the masses." Zhou Yongsheng and his wife said gratefully, "The People's Commune is truly too good."

When Sick

The rain was heavy, and the cold wind did not stop. On the night of the 19th, Zhou Zhuangqiu, a member of the Fifth Team of the Fourth Brigade, suddenly developed a high fever in the middle of the night, becoming delirious, and his condition was very serious. The five commune members who slept with him were all around Zhou Zhuangqiu, at a loss. One member ran to tell the general branch secretary, and Comrade Wu Guowen, the general branch secretary, immediately ran to the clinic, but there was no medicine to treat this kind of disease there. What to do? It was so dark, the rain was so heavy, the illness was so serious, and the rural hospital was more than ten li away, and the phone was not working. "Saving a life is like putting out a fire," there was no time to delay! He braved the rain and rushed to the rural hospital, invited a doctor, gave injections, administered medicine, and took care of him all night. The next morning, Zhou Zhuangqiu's fever subsided, he became conscious, and the public canteen sent porridge. Zhou Zhuangqiu got up and shook the hand of the general branch secretary, saying, "Mother is good, father is good, but the cadres cultivated by the Communist Party are the best, the commune is good."

In order to enhance the health of the commune members, the commune launched a movement of "Everyone loves hygiene, everyone is healthy." Spittoons were placed in public places, lids were added to toilets, which were disinfected once a day, all utensils in the public canteen were covered with sand covers, all ditches were cleaned up, and houses were whitewashed. Because environmental hygiene has improved, the number of people with headaches and fevers has also decreased. According to recent statistics from the rural hospital in the past ten days, the number of people seeking treatment has decreased by 60% compared to the previous ten days.

    当…………的时候
    长寿人民公社生活片断
    人民公社真正好，好处千万数不了；
    老年走进幸福院，衣食住行照顾好；
    儿童到了幼儿园，会唱会舞哈哈笑；
    妇女要生小毛毛，妇产院内接生好；
    青年到了结婚期，举行仪式热闹闹；
    身体生疮或害病，农村医院把病疗；
    亲戚朋友来访问，食堂招待真周到；
    丰衣足食人人乐，人民公社真正好。
    这是湖南平江县长寿人民公社社员们歌颂美好生活的一首顺口溜。真的，这个公社虽然建立不久，就以大队为单位设立了幸福院、幼儿园、妇产院、医疗所，社内还有农村医院。社员们感到处处方便，处处满意。
          当结婚的时候
    10月19日晚，月亮斜挂天空，三大队的厅室内，灯光比平常格外光亮，墙壁上新贴了毛主席像，两旁挂了鲜红的国旗，大门口贴了一副对联：“办好人民公社，建设幸福家庭”。
    原来是刘兰香和胡提农、李元辉和洪桂生两对青年男女举行结婚典礼。男的、女的、老的、少的都陆续向这里走来，这是公社建立后第一次举行婚礼。四个青年都站在台上，人们的眼睛都望着他们。这时，一个社员提议：“要他们讲讲恋爱经过。”随即得到了全体社员拥护。第一个被拥到当中的，就是女英雄排长刘兰香。她说：“我们是从劳动中建立感情的……”一句话刚落音，社员们的笑声、鼓掌声，夹杂着锣鼓声，整个屋子沸腾起来了。随即，文娱活动开始了，有小学生的跳舞，民兵的歌唱，……热闹得很。
    站在旁边的周来香姑娘，斜着眼睛正望着他的未婚夫，表示着：“到明年我们结婚的时候，将更热闹啊！”
    参加婚礼的，还有幸福院的十多个老人，他们一个个都笑得合不拢嘴。其中六十三岁的碧干娘很感慨地说：“现在结婚又热闹，又省钱，真是太好了。过去做新娘子的，要循规蹈矩，笑不露齿，话不高声，走路要走绣花路，做一天新娘子，真是活受罪。”他的话还未说完，吴访大嫂插嘴说：“我迟生三十年，不是也能讲讲恋爱经过，唱个歌……”这句话，引得周围的人哈哈大笑起来。
                当来客的时候
    周永生的岳母吴显干娘，在10月19日随同十多名妇女来长寿公社参观妇女肥料厂。吴显干娘顺路来看看她三年没有见的女婿和女儿。到了周永生家，他们都不在。正打算回去，恰巧碰到了食堂的管理员，便邀她到食堂去，茶呀、洗脸水呀，招待得很周到。社员们中午回来吃饭时，周永生夫妇看见了她，真是高兴得了不得；但食堂开饭了，加菜又来不及，怎么办？正在为难的时候，食堂管理员走来，邀他们去吃饭，桌上摆了四个菜。管理员和蔼地说：“公社党委会昨天晚上研究了，为了照顾社员的来客，食堂每天都要准备一点荤菜，这样加菜就方便了。同时还准备了客房，客人可以住宿。”岳母吴显干娘说：“党做事就是看透了人的心，处处为群众着想。”周永生夫妇很感激地说：“人民公社真是太好了。”
                当病了的时候
    雨下得很大，寒风也没有停止。在19日的晚上，四大队五中队社员周壮秋在半夜里突然发高烧，人迷迷糊糊的，病势很严重。同睡在一起的五个社员，都围在周壮秋旁边，束手无策。一个社员跑去告诉了总支书，总支书吴国文同志马上跑到医疗站，可是那里也没有治这种病的药。怎样办？天这么黑，雨这么大，病这么严重，农村医院又相隔十来里，电话又打不通。“救命如救火”，一刻也不能停留！他便冒雨赶到了农村医院，请来了医师，打针、服药，照顾了一整夜。第二天清早，周壮秋的烧退了，人清醒了，公共食堂送来了稀饭。周壮秋爬起来握着总支书的手说：“娘好，爹好，还是共产党培养出来的干部好，公社好。”
    为了增强社员的身体健康，公社开展了“人人爱卫生、个个身体壮”的运动。公共场所都安置了痰盂，厕所都加上了封盖，每天消毒一次，公共食堂的一切用具都用沙罩遮盖起来，沟坑全部进行了清理，房屋实行了白屋化。由于环境卫生改善了，头痛发烧的人也减少了。据最近十天农村医院统计，治病的人较前十天降低了60％。
