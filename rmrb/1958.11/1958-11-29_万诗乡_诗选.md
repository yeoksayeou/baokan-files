"Myriad Poetry Village" Poetry Selection

Editor's Note: In early September of this year, Dongtianzhuang Township in Fengrun County, Hebei Province, launched a mass poetry writing movement. Those who could write did so, and those who couldn't spoke, truly making everyone a poet and everyone singing. In less than half a month, the township was transformed into a "Myriad Poetry Village." Here are a few selected poems.

	Accumulating Manure is Like Accumulating Gold
	Accumulating manure is like accumulating gold,
	Making fertilizer is like creating gold,
	Fertilizer applied to the land,
	The land becomes a treasure bowl.
		(Zhang Baogui)

	Striving for the Top
	In ancient times, writing poetry emphasized romance,
	Today, writing poetry emphasizes a bountiful harvest,
	Technological innovation, studying culture,
	Liberating thought, striving for the top.
		(Zhang Yunxiang)

	Paradise
	Built a biogas station,
	Gas lamps installed in every home,
	Stars moved to the earth,
	Paradise has come to the human world.
		(Zheng Hongshu, Zhang Fusheng)

	Fast Mill
	The stone mill is ball-bearingized,
	No need to pull with livestock,
	Foot pedal spins like flying,
	Millstone drops snowflakes.
		(Old Man Cui)

	Sending in Public Grain
	Plump wheat stored in the granary,
	Full sacks loaded onto the cart,
	Crimson horse harnessed to the cart,
	Driving the cart to send in public grain.
		(Zhang Fusheng)

	Still the First Time
	Peasants running universities,
	Women and children all writing poetry,
	Five thousand years of history,
	Still the first time.
		(Li Zhiguo)

	Ode to Women
	Yesterday busy at home,
	Today busy in the fields,
	Tomorrow busy where?
	Want to compare heights with men.
	Weeding is a champion,
	Accumulating manure is a general,
	Fetching water is what general?
	Want to compete with men.
			(Xin)

    “万诗乡”诗选
    编者按：河北省丰润县东田庄乡在今年9月初掀起了一个群众性的写诗运动，会写的动手，不会写的动口，真是人人作诗个个歌唱，不到半月，就把这个乡变成了“万诗乡”。这里选登了几首。
    积肥如积金
    积肥如积金，
    造肥如造金，
    肥料上到地，
    地变聚宝盆。
        （张宝贵）
    争上游
    古时作诗讲风流，
    今朝作诗讲丰收，
    技术革新学文化，
    解放思想争上游。
        （张云祥）
    天堂
    修起沼气站，
    汽灯家家安，
    群星移地上，
    天堂到人间。（郑洪树、张复生）
    快速磨
    石磨滚珠化，
    不用牲口拉，
    脚踏转如飞，
    磨盘落雪花。
        （大老崔）
    送公粮
    胖胖麦儿库里藏，
    满满袋儿车上装，
    枣红马儿车上套，
    赶着车儿送公粮。
        （张复生）
    还是第一次
    农民办大学，
    妇孺皆作诗，
    历史五千年，
    还是第一次。
        （李志国）
    颂妇女
    昨天忙在家里，
    今天忙在地里，
    明天忙在哪里？
    要跟男子汉比比高低。
    薅草是健将，
    积肥是大将，
    打水是啥将？
    要跟男子汉较量较量。
            （新）
