In the past, wild herbs were gathered in the deep mountains; today, new seedlings are planted on the spot.
Anhui vigorously develops the production of Chinese medicinal materials.

(Our dispatch) Under the leadership of local Party committees and with the cooperation of all parties, the pharmaceutical departments in Anhui Province have mobilized the masses and adopted various effective measures to vigorously restore and develop the production of Chinese medicinal materials. At present, the total area of medicinal materials cultivated in the province has reached more than 100,000 mu. The number of domesticated animal and plant medicinal materials has expanded from 25 in 1953 to 75. A mass upsurge in the production of medicinal materials has begun to take shape throughout the province.

Anhui Province is one of the major Chinese medicinal material producing areas in China. The province produces more than 700 kinds of animal and plant Chinese medicinal materials. Among them, Dendrobium, musk, Gastrodia elata, honeysuckle, Moutan bark, deer antler, Gong chrysanthemum, Cornus officinalis, Chinese quince, Coptis chinensis, pangolin, Qi atractylodes, Qi snake, Chuzhou chrysanthemum, and Bozhou chrysanthemum are 15 kinds of famous and precious Chinese medicines sold throughout the country.

In the work of developing Chinese medicinal materials, Anhui Province has implemented the policy put forward by the Central Government of "changing wild plants to domestic cultivation and domestication, and promoting the production of authentic medicinal materials alongside production in general areas, to gradually realize local production and local supply." In the past year, it has vigorously mobilized the masses to rely on themselves to cultivate medicinal materials, and has achieved remarkable results. The province has successively established 21 large-scale medicinal material cultivation farms, with a total planting area of 53,500 mu. The varieties that have been put into production include ginseng, Moutan bark, white peony, and 26 other varieties. Animal medicinal materials include deer, pangolins, Qi snakes, bees, and roe deer. On the basis of a bumper harvest in grain production, people's communes in various parts of the province have expanded the scope of medicinal material production, rationally arranged labor, organized professional teams, and adopted the method of simultaneous organized harvesting and planned cultivation to expand medicinal material production. At present, the area of medicinal materials specially cultivated by people's communes in various places has reached 55,000 mu. Some people's communes in Lujiang, Qianshan, and Zongyang counties have also established medicinal material experimental farms. Various localities have also universally mobilized organs, schools, farms, and parks to cultivate flower and woody medicinal materials in conjunction with greening.

In order to widely survey medicinal materials and carry out large-scale multi-variety production, Anhui Province has also run two sessions of Chinese medicine training classes, specializing in training personnel to go to the mountains to collect medicinal material specimens and survey medicinal resources. In the past year alone, 16 kinds of new and precious Chinese medicines, such as Lygodium japonicum and Dysosma versipellis, have been discovered, greatly expanding the source of medicinal materials. In addition, a medicinal material technical school and four training courses have been established in five large-scale cultivation farms in Hefei, Fanchang, Shexian, Chuzhou, and Xiaoxian to study and produce on the spot, and train medicinal material technicians, laying a technical foundation for the development of medicinal material production.

### 昔日深山采野药　今天就地种新苗  安徽大力发展中药材生产

    昔日深山采野药　今天就地种新苗
    安徽大力发展中药材生产
    本报讯　安徽省药材部门在各地党委的领导下，和各方协作，发动群众，采取多种有效措施，大力恢复和发展中药材生产。目前全省培植的药材总面积已达十万亩以上，家养家种的动植物药材由1953年的二十五种扩大到七十五种，一个群众性的药材生产高潮已在全省开始形成。
    安徽省是我国主要中药材产区之一，全省出产的各种动植物中药材共有七百多种，其中石斛、麝香、天麻、银花、丹皮、鹿茸、贡菊、萸肉、木瓜、黄连、穿山甲、祁术、祁蛇、滁菊、亳菊等十五种，是行销全国的名贵中药。
    安徽省在发展中药材工作中，贯彻了中央提出的“改野生为家种家养，地道药材与一般地区生产并举，以逐步实行就地生产就地供应”的方针，近一年来，大力发动群众，依靠群众培植药材，已获得显著效果。全省陆续建立的各种大型药材培植场已达二十一个，种植面积共五万三千五百多亩。目前已投入生产的有园参、丹皮、白芍等二十六个品种；饲养动物药材有鹿、穿山甲、祁蛇、蜜蜂、獐子等。全省各地人民公社在粮食生产大丰收的基础上，都扩大了药材生产的范围，并合理安排了劳力，组织专业队，采取有组织采挖和有计划培植同时并举的办法，来扩大药材生产。现在各地人民公社专门培植的药材种植面积已有五万五千亩，庐江、潜山、枞阳等县部分人民公社还办了药材试验场。各地还普遍发动机关、学校、农场、公园，结合绿化培植花类和木本药材。
    为广泛地勘察药材，大规模开展多品种生产，安徽省还开办了两期中药训练班，专门训练人员上山采集药材标本和勘察药源，仅去年和今年就发现新品种海金沙、八角连等名贵中药十六种，大大扩大了药材来源。此外还在合肥、繁昌、歙县、滁县、萧县等五个大型培植场，办了一所药材技术学校和四个训练班，就地学习，就地生产，培养药材技术人员，为开展药材生产奠定技术基础。
