Xinhua News Agency report: The East China Working Group of the State Bureau of Metrology, the Changzhou Institute of Metrology and Verification, and other units recently successfully tested a set of simple instruments—a flow meter, a pressure gauge, and a thermometer—on the indigenous blast furnaces of the Changzhou United Steel Plant No. 3. These instruments can reflect the production situation inside the furnace at any time, ensuring the normal production of the indigenous furnaces.

This set of instruments consists of two curved glass tubes, a glass thermometer, and a Pitot tube. Previously, the Pitot tube had to be made of copper, and the pressure gauge had to use mercury. Now, the experiment has successfully used glass tubes to replace copper Pitot tubes and water to replace mercury, which not only saves money but also solves the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. The effectiveness of this indigenous instrument is the same as that of foreign instruments, and it is even more convenient to use than foreign ones. At the same time, it is inexpensive to manufacture and easy to obtain materials, so it can be mass-produced everywhere.

After the indigenous blast furnaces were equipped with these instruments, it was as if they had been fitted with "telescopes." Workers can actively control the furnace's production situation based on the rise and fall of the water column inside the glass tube. If they find any "problems," they can promptly "prescribe the right medicine" for treatment and rescue. The workers of Changzhou United Steel Plant No. 3 unanimously praised the instruments after using them, saying that the instruments are eyes and doctors, extending the life of the furnace and producing more iron.

### 土高炉戴上了“望远镜”

    土高炉戴上了“望远镜”
    新华社讯　国家计量局华东工作组和常州计量检定所等单位，最近在常州市联钢三厂的土高炉上试验成功一套简单仪表——风量计、压力计和温度计。这些仪表能够随时反映出炉内生产情况，保证土炉正常生产。
    这套仪表是由两个弯玻璃管、一个玻璃温度计和一个毕托管组成的。以前，毕托管要用紫铜做，压力计里要用水银；现在试验成功用玻璃管代替紫铜做的毕托管、用水代替水银，既省钱又能解决原材料不足的困难。这种土制仪表的效用同洋的一样，而且使用起来比洋的更简便；同时，它的造价低廉，取材容易，各地都能大量生产。
    土高炉装上这种仪表以后，真像戴了“望远镜”一样，工人们可以根据玻璃管内水柱的升降，主动控制炉子生产情况；如果发现“毛病”，可以及时“对症下药”治疗抢救。常州市联钢三厂的工人使用这种仪表以后一致称赞说，仪表就是眼睛，就是医生，使炉子寿命延长，多出铁。
