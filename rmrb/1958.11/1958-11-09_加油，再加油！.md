　　Add Oil, Add More Oil!

　　The petroleum industry is one of the pioneers in the Great Leap Forward. When the steel marshal is advancing triumphantly, it not only requires the pioneer represented by railways (including highway and waterway transportation) to catch up quickly, but also requires the pioneer represented by electricity (including coal and petroleum) to catch up quickly.

　　Can it catch up? Can it shoulder the task of a pioneer? Some experts who consider themselves "masters of the oil fields" are doubtful. They say that the speed of drilling is limited, the supply of oil extraction and refining equipment is difficult, and the exploitation of shallow oil layers has no economic value. How can we catch up quickly? The workers on the petroleum front do not see it this way. They believe that whether or not we can catch up depends on whether we dare to boldly mobilize the masses to do it. The fact is that when people's minds are bound by the theories of certain expert authorities, they will be constrained and accomplish nothing, and even if they achieve something, they will inevitably do some stupid things. However, once we break down superstitions, liberate our minds, and trust the masses, all kinds of indigenous methods combined with our country's specific conditions and methods combining indigenous and foreign techniques will be created. This year's drilling speed is three times that of last year, and shallow oil layers, which were once considered to have no exploitation value, have now been found to have cost-effective exploitation methods.

　　Combining China's specific conditions to find a Chinese-style development path should not be seen as a technical problem, but as a matter of policy. In political struggle and class struggle, many comrades, under the leadership of the Party, have mastered the truth of combining universal laws with China's reality and achieved victory in the struggle. As for how to apply this principle to industrial construction, many comrades have not yet fully grasped it in their thinking. They only look up to large oil fields, but despise shallow oil layers. They only want to engage in large and foreign projects, but are unwilling to engage in small and indigenous projects. In fact, the "combination of indigenous and foreign" is the combination of universal truth with China's reality. If we want to develop the petroleum industry at high speed, it is not feasible to wait specifically for foreign designs and large equipment. Therefore, starting from China's specific conditions and adhering to the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods and vigorously launching mass movements is a shortcut to high-speed development of petroleum.

　　In the past year, China's petroleum industry has come up with many methods in drilling, design, construction, and production, opening up a new situation. In the future, it is necessary to vigorously promote existing experiences, push the petroleum industry to a new upsurge, add wings to the marshal, and add fuel to the leap forward.

### 加油，再加油！

    加油，再加油！
    石油工业是大跃进中先行官之一。当钢铁元帅高歌猛进的时候，不仅需要以铁路为代表的（包括公路、水路运输）先行官赶快赶上去，而且要求以电力为代表的（包括煤炭、石油）先行官也很快赶上去。
    能不能赶上去？能不能担负先行官的任务？在某些以“油田主人”自居的专家看来，是怀疑的。他们说，钻井的速度是有限的，采油和炼油设备供应又很困难，浅油层的开采又没有什么经济价值，怎么能快速赶上去呢？石油战线上的工人却不是这样看：他们认为能不能赶上去，问题在于敢不敢大胆放手让群众去干。事实正是这样：当人们的思想受着某些专家权威理论束缚的时候，就会束手束脚，一事无成，即使有所作为也难免做出一些蠢事来。然而，一旦破除迷信，解放思想，信赖群众，各种各样的结合我国具体情况的土办法和土洋结合的办法都创造出来了。今年的钻井速度等于去年的三倍，一向被认为没有开采价值的浅油层，现在也找到了多快好省的开采方法。
    结合中国具体情况找出中国式的开采道路，这不应该作为技术问题来看，而是作为方针来看。在政治斗争阶级斗争上，许多同志在党的领导下，掌握了普遍规律同中国实际相结合的真理，取得了斗争的胜利。至于如何把这个道理运用到工业建设上去，许多同志在思想领受上还不是那么深切。他们只看得起大油田，却看不起浅油层，他们只愿搞大的洋的，不愿搞小的土的，其实，“土洋结合”就是普遍真理与中国实际相结合。我们要高速度发展石油工业，要是专门等待洋设计，大设备，这是不行的。所以从中国具体情况出发，坚持土洋结合大搞群众运动的方针，是高速度发展石油的一条捷径。
    一年来，我国石油工业在钻探、设计、施工、生产等方面想了很多办法，打开了新的局面。今后，需要大力推广已有的经验，把石油工业推向一个更新的高潮，为元帅添翼，为跃进加油。
