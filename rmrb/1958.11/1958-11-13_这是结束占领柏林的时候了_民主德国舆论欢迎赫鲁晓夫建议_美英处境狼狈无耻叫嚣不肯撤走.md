Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 11th: All national newspapers in the German Democratic Republic published in Berlin today featured Khrushchev's speech on the German question and the status of Berlin at the mass rally in Moscow welcoming the delegation of the Polish People's Republic on the 10th, prominently on the front page.

    "Neues Deutschland" published the full text of this part of Khrushchev's speech under the title "Western Countries Have Destroyed the Legal Basis for Their Stay in Berlin." The newspaper wrote: Due to West Germany's reconstruction of militarism and atomic armament, all the key points of the Potsdam Agreement have been undermined, and the past Berlin Agreement has therefore become obsolete. "Berliner Zeitung" said that Khrushchev's proposal on the German question and the status of Berlin is a serious warning to the Bonn revanchists.

    West Berlin newspapers also published news of Khrushchev's speech prominently on the front page.

Xinhua News Agency, November 12th: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev's proposal on the 10th to end the occupation status of Berlin and withdraw foreign troops from Berlin has left Western countries in a very difficult situation. The U.S. and British governments issued statements on the evening of the same day, unreasonably rejecting the Soviet proposal and attempting to justify their own conspiracy to occupy West Berlin for a long time.

    U.S. State Department spokesman White brazenly stated at a press conference in Washington on the evening of the 10th that the United States does not intend to withdraw from West Berlin. He specifically cited U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's clamor to continue occupying Berlin, Dulles said on November 7: "We have given extremely solemn assurances to defend West Berlin, resorting to force if necessary."

    The British Foreign Office also issued a similar statement, insisting that the Western countries' position in Berlin was not stipulated by the Potsdam Agreement, but was "the right of occupation obtained due to Germany's unconditional surrender," attempting to continue to stay in Berlin under such a pretext.

    The French government did not immediately express its opinion. However, it can be seen from Agence France-Presse reports that the French ruling group felt very uneasy. The news agency quoted "well-informed sources in Paris" in an attempt to make people think that the reasons listed by Khrushchev in the statement did not conform to "the actual situation." These people insisted that the French army's stay in Berlin was not based on the Potsdam Agreement but on "many agreements that continue to be valid."

    According to a report by the Bonn correspondent of the British "Daily Telegraph," Khrushchev's proposal was equivalent to "a bomb that exploded" for the West German capital.

    West German Chargé d'Affaires in London Ritter specifically discussed this matter with British Foreign Office Permanent Under-Secretary Hoyer-Millar on the 11th. The Associated Press pointed out in its report on the meeting: "It is believed that West Germany wants the Western countries to issue a new statement reaffirming their attitude towards Berlin."

    这是结束占领柏林的时候了
    民主德国舆论欢迎赫鲁晓夫建议
    美英处境狼狈无耻叫嚣不肯撤走
    新华社柏林11日电　在柏林出版的所有民主德国全国性报纸今天都在第一版头条地位刊登了赫鲁晓夫10日在莫斯科欢迎波兰人民共和国代表团的群众大会上关于德国问题和柏林地位问题的讲话。
    “新德意志报”以“西方国家毁坏了它们留驻柏林的法律基础”为题登了赫鲁晓夫这部分讲话的全文。这家报纸写道：由于西德重建军国主义和进行原子武装，使得波茨坦协定所有的要点都遭到破坏，过去的柏林协议由此也成为过时的了。“柏林日报”说，赫鲁晓夫关于德国问题和柏林地位问题的主张是对波恩复仇主义者的严重警告。
    西柏林的报纸也在头版显著地位刊登了赫鲁晓夫讲话的消息。
    新华社12日讯　苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫10日关于结束柏林的占领状态和从柏林撤退外国驻军的建议使西方国家非常狼狈。美英两国政府当天晚上分别发表声明，无理拒绝苏联的建议，并且替它们自己企图长期侵占西柏林的阴谋进行狡辩。
    美国国务院发言人怀特10日晚上在华盛顿的记者招待会上悍然表示，美国不打算撤出西柏林。他特别引用了美国国务卿杜勒斯坚持要继续占领柏林的叫嚣，杜勒斯在11月7日曾说：“我们已经极其郑重地保证守住西柏林，必要时要诉诸武力。”
    英国外交部也发表了一项类似的声明，硬说西方国家在柏林的地位不是由波茨坦协定规定的，而是“由于德国无条件投降而得到的占领权利”，企图在这样的借口下继续赖在柏林。
    法国政府没有立刻表示意见。但是，从法新社的消息中可以看出，法国统治集团感到非常不安。这家通讯社引“巴黎消息灵通人士”的话，企图使人认为赫鲁晓夫在声明中所列举的理由是不符合“实际情况”的。这些人士硬说，法军留驻柏林不是以波茨坦协定而是以“继续有效的许多协议”为依据的。
    据英国“每日电讯报”驻波恩记者报道，赫鲁晓夫的建议对西德首都来说，等于“一枚爆炸了的炸弹”。
    西德驻伦敦代办里特11日特地就这件事同英国外交部常务次官霍耶—米勒进行了商谈。美联社在报道这次会谈时指出：“人们认为，西德想让西方国家发表一项新的声明，重申它们对柏林的态度”。
