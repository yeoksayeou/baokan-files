Xinhua News Agency News: China's first group of "Sino-Western integrated" doctors has been trained by the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Class organized by the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

This research class was established by the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine at the end of 1955. The students were Western medicine doctors sent from various regions, including lecturers, attending physicians, and resident physicians. During the two and a half years, they studied the Party's policies on traditional Chinese medicine, dialectical materialism, and essential knowledge of the "Inner Canon," "Treatise on Febrile Diseases," "Shen Nong's Herbal Classic," and other traditional Chinese medicine theories. Combining theoretical study, the students also undertook a year and three months of clinical practice, interning with experienced veteran traditional Chinese medicine doctors in Beijing, Nanjing, Suzhou, and other places. Some students went to rural areas to treat the masses during their internships. At the end of their studies, each student wrote a thesis. Some theses summarized the treatment experiences of veteran traditional Chinese medicine doctors over many years, while others were theoretical explorations. Theses such as "A Unique Link in Traditional Chinese Medicine - Regulating the Spleen and Stomach" by student Lü Weibai and "The Pattern of Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment for Chronic Hepatosplenomegaly" by Zhang Shuncheng were praised by veteran traditional Chinese medicine doctors. Among the seventy-six students who graduated this time, twenty-five students received first, second, and third-class medals and certificates from the Ministry of Health.

After theoretical study and clinical practice, the students basically mastered the theory of traditional Chinese medicine and were able to use both traditional Chinese and Western medical techniques for clinical diagnosis, teaching, and research work. From practice, they have begun to open the treasure trove of traditional Chinese medicine, applying the comprehensive and dialectical treatment principles of traditional Chinese medicine to cure many diseases that Western medicine previously considered untreatable. Western medicine surgeon Li Zumo, under the guidance of veteran traditional Chinese medicine doctors, treated a patient suffering from "thromboangiitis obliterans." At that time, the patient's leg skin was already purplish-black, and his toes were rotting. Some hospitals suggested amputation. Based on Li Zumo's past experience, surgery was the only option, but this time, when he participated in the diagnosis and treatment of this surgical disease, he did not need to perform surgery. He only used prescriptions such as "Shi Quan Da Bu Tang" (Ten-Ingredient Decoction for Great Tonification), "Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang" (Ginseng Nutritive Decoction), and Chinese herbal medicines such as Astragalus and Scrophularia, and the patient recovered after three months. Western medicine internist Lü Weibai used to hear that traditional Chinese medicine and herbal medicine had high efficacy for "organic lesions" and felt it was mysterious. Now, he has begun to master this "mysterious" medical technology. A patient who had suffered from kidney inflammation for three years had very poor kidney function and was ineffective after Western medicine treatment. After he treated the patient with traditional Chinese medicine and herbal medicine, the patient's kidney function completely returned to normal, and this person has joined the reclamation of the Great Northern Wilderness. Students Lin Pingqing, Lu Tianxin, Wang Ronghe, and others often encountered so-called "unnamed diseases" in Western medicine: such as patients feeling unwell, chest tightness, etc., but no disease could be found after Western medicine laboratory tests. Now, using the principles and methods of traditional Chinese medicine for diagnosis and treatment, they have cured many such patients. They have also used traditional Chinese medicine and herbal medicine to treat aplastic anemia, cirrhosis, hypertension, optic nerve atrophy, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease, and other diseases with previously low efficacy in Western medicine, with very high efficacy. These situations have made them further realize that traditional Chinese medicine is a great treasure trove, and that learning traditional Chinese medicine well should become the direction of efforts to develop medicine.

Their learning experience proves that to learn traditional Chinese medicine, Western medicine practitioners must first correct their attitude towards traditional Chinese medicine and correct the slavish ideology of valuing foreign things over Chinese ones. They realized in their studies that past erroneous views, such as "there is nothing to learn from traditional Chinese medicine," "it has neither theory nor science," and that traditional Chinese medicine is "Cai Lun's papermaking," only of historical significance, are groundless. Some students initially held a skeptical attitude towards traditional Chinese medicine, but after studying and practicing, they developed a strong interest in traditional Chinese medicine and expressed their determination to inherit and promote the medical traditions of the motherland.

    开始打开祖国医学的伟大宝库
    首批“中西合璧”医生诞生
    新华社讯　我国第一批“中西合璧”的医生，已由中医研究院举办的中医研究班培养出来。
    这个研究班是中医研究院在1955年底举办的。学员都是各地派来的西医，有讲师、主治医师和住院医师。在两年半的期间内，他们学习了党的中医政策、辩证唯物主义和内经知要、伤寒论、神农本草经等中医、医药理论。结合理论学习，学员们还进行了一年零三个月的临床实习，分别到北京、南京、苏州等地，跟有经验的老中医实习。部分学员在实习时到农村为群众治病。学习结束时，每个学员都写了论文。有的论文总结了中医老先生多年治疗的经验，也有的论文是理论性的探讨。学员吕维柏写的“祖国医学独特的一环——调理脾胃”和张舜丞写的“慢性肝脾肿大病中医治疗的规律”等论文都受到老中医的赞扬。这次毕业的七十六名学员中，有二十五名学员分别获得卫生部一、二、三等奖章和奖状。
    学员们经过理论学习和临床实践后，基本上掌握了中医的理论，能运用中、西医两套医学技术进行临床诊断、教学和研究工作。他们从实践中已开始打开祖国医学的宝库，运用全面、辩证施治的中医治疗原则，治好了不少过去西医认为无法治疗的疾病。外科西医李祖谟在老中医指导下治疗一个患“血拴闭塞性脉管炎”的病人，当时病人腿部皮肤已经呈紫黑色，指头也烂了，有的医院提出要给他截肢。根据李祖谟过去的经验，也只有开刀，但是这次他参加诊断治疗这种外科病时，却不用动手术，只用“十全大补汤”、“人参养荣汤”和黄蓍、元参等中药处方，三个月后病人就好了。内科西医吕维柏过去听说中医中药对“器质性病变”疗效很高，感到奇妙。现在，他已开始能掌握这种“奇妙”的医疗技术了。一个曾患三年肾脏炎的病人，肾脏功能很坏，经西医治疗无效。经他用中医中药治疗，肾功能完全恢复正常，这个人已参加了北大荒的开荒。学员林平青、陆天鑫、王荣和等过去常常遇到西医所谓“无名病”：如病人感到全身不适、胸闷等，经过西医化验检查都找不出是什么病。现在，用中医的原则方法诊断治疗，却治好了许多这样的病人。他们还用中医中药治疗再生不良性贫血、肝硬变、高血压、视神经萎缩、慢性盆腔炎等过去西医疗效很低的疾病，都有很高的疗效。这些情况使他们进一步认识到祖国医学是个伟大的宝库，西医学好中医应成为发展医学的努力方向。
    他们的学习经验证明，西医学中医首先要端正对待中医的态度，纠正重外轻中的奴化思想。他们在学习中体会到过去认为中医“没有什么可学的”、“既没有理论又不科学”、中医是“蔡伦造纸”，只有历史意义等错误看法，是毫无根据的。有的学员开始学习时对中医还是抱半信半疑的态度，经过学习、实践后，他们对中医产生了浓厚的兴趣，表示要努力继承祖国的医学传统并且发扬它。
