Xinhua News Agency, Xining, November 10th: The "July 13th" People's Commune in Xining City, Qinghai Province, has launched activities to respect the labor of the "Four Workers" (cooks, childcare workers, midwives, and animal caretakers) and love their work, which has greatly improved the commune's public welfare undertakings and animal husbandry work.

This commune has a population of 48,000. It has established 284 canteens, 67 nurseries, 7 maternity hospitals, and all of its more than 20,000 livestock have been raised collectively. 92% of the commune members eat in public canteens. Some time ago, the commune did not pay enough attention to the work of canteens, nurseries, maternity hospitals, and livestock farms. Many of the "Four Workers" were not content with their own work, feeling that they were "serving people" and not as valued as industrial and agricultural production. Some commune members also thought that the work of the "Four Workers" was simple and effortless, and looked down on them.

In response to the above situation, the commune Party committee used spare time to organize commune members to debate "Is the work of the 'Four Workers' important and glorious?" and "What is the relationship between the work of the 'Four Workers' and industrial and agricultural production?" During the debate, many big-character posters were put up with relevant criticisms, praises, and self-criticisms. The Third Team also held a meeting attended by 250 people to respect the glorious labor of the "Four Workers." Commune member Wang Guotai praised Han Shunlong, a cook who could endure hardship and loved cooking. Wu Yuzhen, a female commune member who had previously been rude to the cooks, made a self-criticism at the meeting. In this way, the cooks and childcare workers were greatly encouraged. Many people took the initiative to examine their shortcomings in cooking and being impatient with children, and promised to do a better job.

Through mass debates and self-education, the socialist and communist consciousness of all commune members and the "Four Workers" was generally improved. All canteens generally studied and formulated measures and specific methods to ensure that commune members were well-fed. These methods and measures have begun to be implemented, and the commune members have composed a quick-rhyme to praise them: "The cooks are energetic, and they have ways to save coal and rice. The food is hot and the dishes are good, and the commune members eat and laugh."

The childcare workers in the nurseries also tidied up the interior overnight, whitewashed the rooms themselves, renovated and expanded the nurseries, and increased the number of children admitted. The nannies in the nursery of the First Team also sewed more than 40 floral cotton quilts for the children, made more than 100 wooden toys, and stipulated that two nannies should take turns on duty every night to take care of the children. They also raised three dairy cows. After the commune members realized the importance of the work of the "Four Workers," they also automatically squeezed out their evening rest time to help the nurseries build heated brick beds, repair doors and windows, and level the ground, so that the nurseries were brand new. Many female commune members were very satisfied after visiting the nurseries. Pregnant woman Ma Yumei was moved to tears when she visited the nursery. She said, "For generations in my family, no child has ever been cared for so well."

After the staff working in maternity hospitals and livestock farms were respected by the broad masses of commune members, their enthusiasm for labor soared. All twenty-one babies delivered in the Houzihe Maternity Hospital in October were safe and sound. Recently, the midwives also took the initiative to conduct two or three prenatal examinations for the thirteen pregnant women in their district who were about to give birth. The animal caretakers at the livestock farms no longer said that their work was the "dirtiest" and "smelliest," and their labor was even more active. They got up in the middle of the night to add feed to the livestock and made feed for the pigs in the moonlight. They cleaned the pigsties and stables, whitewashed the walls, and ensured that the large livestock were prosperous, strong, and fat.

The development of public welfare undertakings has further inspired the soaring enthusiasm of the commune members. The whole commune is busy day and night, with lights everywhere. At present, 85% of the autumn harvest threshing and deep plowing for winter irrigation has been completed, and all the public grain has been put into storage.

    侍候人是光荣的事
    七一三公社开展尊重“四员”运动
    据新华社西宁10日电　青海西宁市“七一三”人民公社开展尊重“四员”（炊事员、保育员、接生员、饲养员）劳动，热爱“四员”劳动的活动，使公社公共福利事业和畜牧工作搞得很好。
    这个公社拥有四万八千人口，已办起二百八十四个食堂、六十七个托儿所、七个妇产院，两万多头牲口也都已全部集中饲养。全社92％的人都在公共食堂用饭。前些时候，这个公社对食堂、托儿所、妇产院、牲畜场等工作注意得不够。不少“四员”不安心本身的工作，认为自己是“侍候人”的，不如工农业生产那样受人重视。有些社员也认为“四员”工作简单，不花力气，看不起他们。
    公社党委对上述情况，利用空隙时间，组织社员辩论“四员工作究竟重要不重要，光荣不光荣？”“四员工作和工农业生产的关系？”辩论中，张贴出很多有关的批评、表扬和自我检查的大字报。三队还开了个有二百五十人参加的尊重“四员”光荣劳动的大会。社员王国泰在会上表扬了能吃苦耐劳、热爱炊事工作的炊事员韩顺龙；曾经对炊事员耍过态度的女社员吴玉珍，在会上作了检讨。这样，炊事员、保育员们受到了很大的鼓舞，许多人主动检讨自己饭菜做得不好、对孩子不耐心的缺点，保证把工作做得更好。
    通过大辩论和群众性的自我教育，全社社员和“四员”的社会主义、共产主义觉悟普遍提高。各食堂普遍研究和订出了如何保证社员吃饱吃好的措施和具体办法。这些办法和措施都已开始实行，社员们编了快板来歌颂：“炊事员，干劲大，节省煤米有办法，饭既热来菜又好，社员吃得笑哈哈”。
    托儿所的保育员们也连夜整理内部，自己粉刷屋子，改修和扩大托儿所，增加托儿数量。一队托儿所的阿姨还给孩子们缝了四十多床花棉被，做了一百多件木质玩具；规定每晚有两个阿姨轮流值班照护孩子；还喂养了三头奶牛。社员们认识到“四员”工作的重要性以后，也都自动地挤出晚上休息时间帮助托儿所盘炕、修理门窗和平整地面，使托儿所焕然一新。许多女社员到托儿所参观后，十分满意。孕妇马玉梅到托儿所参观时，竟感动得流了泪，她说，“我家几辈子，那个娃娃也没这样好的照护过。”
    在妇产院和畜牧场工作的人员受到广大社员尊重后，劳动热情空前高涨。后子河妇产院10月份接生的二十一个婴儿，个个平安。最近，接生员还主动地到所在区的十三个即将分娩的孕妇家里进行两三次产前检查。畜牧场的饲养员们也不讲他们是最“脏”最“臭”的工作了，劳动更加积极。半夜起来为牲口加料，在月光底下给猪弄饲料。他们把猪圈马厩打扫得干干净净，墙壁刷得粉白，保证大畜兴旺，体壮膘肥。
    公共福利事业的开展，进一步鼓起了社员们的冲天干劲，全社不分白天黑夜到处车水马龙，灯火连天。目前，秋收碾场、深翻冬灌已完成85％，公粮已全部入库。
