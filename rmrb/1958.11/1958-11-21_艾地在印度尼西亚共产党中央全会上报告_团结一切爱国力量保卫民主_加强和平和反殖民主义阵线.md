Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 20th - The Seventh Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party opened in Jakarta on the 19th.

　　Party General Secretary Aidit delivered a political report at the meeting on behalf of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee, entitled "Unite and Take the Road of Guided Democracy to Realize President Sukarno's Program." In his report, Aidit called for the establishment of broad people's unity, taking the road of guided democracy, in order to realize President Sukarno's program 100%, continue to defend the people's democracy and political rights, and constantly strengthen the international front against war and colonialism.

　　Aidit said that the task of the Indonesian Communist Party is to further strengthen cooperation with all patriotic forces in order to promote the government to more actively support the international front against colonialism and war.

　　Speaking of the domestic situation, Aidit pointed out that Indonesia's domestic situation is gradually improving. Thanks to the resolute attitude adopted by President Sukarno, the government, various democratic parties, the armed forces, and the people, the rebel groups have been basically suppressed.

　　Aidit said, but this does not mean that the forces of imperialism have fundamentally failed. Imperialists are still hindering the Indonesian people from moving forward and threatening Indonesia's independence and sovereignty. Aidit went on to say that imperialists are carrying out specific activities. For example, the United States is trying to influence certain groups to make them willing to organize a military government, which means overthrowing the Djuanda Cabinet. Aidit said that recently, according to the decision of the Southeast Asia Section of the U.S. State Department, some leaders of the Masyumi Party are actively carrying out activities in an attempt to dissolve the Djuanda Cabinet. They are attempting to organize a cabinet with their participation in order to continue to support the activities of the "Revolutionary Government" and the "Overall Struggle Charter" rebel groups.

　　Aidit continued that British imperialism has not remained silent either. Whenever possible, they will also try to profit from Indonesia's internal contradictions.

　　Aidit said that imperialists and domestic reactionaries are trying to confuse the contradiction between the people and imperialism with the contradictions within the people by using newspapers, conspiracies, and slanders. They are creating contradictions between nationalists and patriotic religious believers. They are also creating contradictions between these two groups and the Communist Party; between the working people and the army. They are even trying to create contradictions between Sukarno and the leaders of the army and patriotic forces.

　　Aidit said that the current situation is that the system of liberal democracy has become unpopular, but the conditions for realizing a system of people's democracy have not yet been met; fascists are planning dictatorial plans, but the people are resolutely defending their political power.

　　Aidit said that President Sukarno's proposal to implement guided democracy is very important because its content is basically opposed to liberalism, military dictatorship, or personal dictatorship.

　　He pointed out that guided democracy will make it possible to solve some of the pressing problems of the Indonesian people, namely: national unity and a certain degree of economic construction and improvement of the people's lives.

　　Aidit pointed out that the implementation of guided democracy must have the following two conditions: First, the purpose of guided democracy must be to ensure the broad unity of the people, and President Sukarno's program must be realized 100%, the primary task of which is to establish a cooperative cabinet based on proportional representation; at the same time, the national economy must emphasize thrift, thereby promoting national economic development and eliminating the influence of foreign monopoly capital. Second, the realization of guided democracy must be led by President Sukarno. Therefore, President Sukarno must be given special privileges to allow those patriots who have won the trust of the people to fill certain parliamentary seats.

　　Speaking of the Djuanda Cabinet, Aidit said that at present, the Indonesian Communist Party has no reason to change its attitude towards the Djuanda Cabinet. The support of the Indonesian Communist Party is sincere and critical, that is, the Communist Party wholeheartedly supports its progressive policies, criticizes its hesitant policies to promote its progress, and opposes its policies that are detrimental to the people. As long as the Djuanda Cabinet does not hinder the movement for national independence and democracy, the Indonesian Communist Party will continue to fully support it.

　　Aidit severely criticized attempts to replace the system of liberal democracy with fascism, military dictatorship, or personal dictatorship. Aidit pointed out that this group of people shamelessly talked about Indonesia's "backwardness" because France's De Gaulle, Pakistan's Ayub Khan, and Thailand's Nai Sarit had taken the lead in this regard. This group of people is trying to "overcome" the incompetence of liberal democracy with fascism, but in fact fascism is even more incompetent. These people often want to obtain temporary satisfaction regardless of life and death.

　　In his report, Aidit pointed out that the socialist camp is becoming increasingly consolidated, the independent and peaceful movement is becoming increasingly powerful, while the imperialist, colonialist, and war camp is becoming increasingly weakened and is collapsing. He gave high praise to the economic cooperation between socialist countries, the joint communiqué of Khrushchev and Mao Zedong, the Soviet Union's seven-year economic plan, and China's Great Leap Forward.

　　Aidit then condemned the United States for its provocations against China and condemned the United States for creating the conspiracy of "two Chinas."

    艾地在印度尼西亚共产党中央全会上报告
    团结一切爱国力量保卫民主  加强和平和反殖民主义阵线
    据新华社雅加达20日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会第七次全体会议（扩大）19日在雅加达开幕。
    党的总书记艾地代表党中央委员会政治局在会上作了题为“团结起来，走有领导的民主的道路以实现苏加诺总统的方案”的政治报告。艾地在报告中号召建立广泛的人民团结，走上有领导的民主的道路，以便百分之百地实现苏加诺总统的方案，继续保卫人民的民主和政治权利，不断加强反对战争和反对殖民主义的国际阵线。
    艾地说，印度尼西亚共产党的任务是：进一步加强同一切爱国力量的合作，以便推动政府更积极地支持反对殖民主义和战争的国际阵线。
    艾地在谈到国内形势时指出，印度尼西亚的国内形势正在逐渐好转。由于苏加诺总统、政府、各民主党派、武装部队和人民采取了坚决的态度，叛乱集团已经基本上被镇压下去。
    艾地说，但是这并不是说，帝国主义的力量已经根本失败了。帝国主义者仍然在阻挠印度尼西亚人民前进，并且威胁印度尼西亚的独立和主权。艾地接着说，帝国主义者在进行具体的活动，例如美国正在企图影响某些集团，以便使它们愿意组织军政府，这就是说要推翻朱安达内阁。艾地说，最近根据美国国务院东南亚科的决定，马斯友美党的一些领袖正在积极进行活动，企图解散朱安达内阁。他们企图组织一个有他们参加的内阁，以便继续支持“革命政府”和“全面斗争约章”叛乱集团的活动。
    艾地接着说，英帝国主义也并没有保持沉默。只要有可能，他们也会试图从印度尼西亚的国内矛盾中捞一把。
    艾地说，帝国主义和国内反动派企图用报纸、阴谋和毁谤来把人民和帝国主义之间的矛盾同人民内部的矛盾混淆起来。他们在民族主义者和爱国的宗教信徒之间制造矛盾。他们还在这两个集团和共产党之之间制造矛盾；在劳动人民和军队间制造矛盾。他们甚至竭力设法在苏加诺同军队和爱国力量的领导之间制造矛盾。
    艾地说，目前的局势是，自由民主制度已经不得人心，但是还没有实现人民民主制度的条件；法西斯分子正在策划独裁计划，但是人民正在坚决地保卫他们的政治权力。
    艾地说，苏加诺总统倡议的实行有领导的民主的主张是非常重要的，因为它的内容基本上是反对自由主义、军事独裁或个人独裁的。
    他指出，有领导的民主将有可能解决印度尼西亚人民的某些迫切的问题，这就是：国家统一以及某种程度的经济建设和人民生活的改善。
    艾地指出，实行有领导的民主必须具备下列两个条件：第一，有领导的民主的目的必须是保证人民的广泛团结，而且必须百分之百地实现苏加诺总统的方案，其中首要的是建立以比例代表制为基础的合作内阁；同时，国家经济必须强调节约，从而促进全国经济发展和消除外国垄断资本的影响。第二，实现有领导的民主一定要由苏加诺总统领导。因此，必须给予苏加诺总统特权，使那些获得人民信任的爱国人士填补某些议员的席位。
    谈到朱安达内阁，艾地说，目前印度尼西亚共产党没有理由改变它对朱安达内阁的态度。印度尼西亚共产党的支持是真诚的和批判性的，那就是，共产党毫无保留地支持它的进步政策，批评它迟迟不前的政策，以促使它进步，同时反对它的不利于人民的政策。只要朱安达内阁不阻挠争取民族独立和民主的运动，印度尼西亚共产党将继续全力支持它。
    艾地严厉地批评有人企图以法西斯主义、军事独裁或者个人独裁来代替自由民主制度。艾地指出，这批人因为法国的戴高乐、巴基斯坦的阿尤布汗和泰国的乃沙立在这方面走先了一步，无耻地大谈印度尼西亚的“落后”。这批人试图以法西斯主义来“克服”自由民主制度的无能，事实上法西斯主义更为无能。这些人往往想得到暂时的满足而不顾死活。
    艾地在报告中谈到国际问题时指出，社会主义阵营日益巩固，独立和和平运动日益强大，而帝国主义、殖民主义和战争阵营则越来越削弱，并且在垮台中。他对于社会主义国家之间的经济合作、赫鲁晓夫和毛泽东的联合公报、苏联的七年经济计划和中国的大跃进给予很高的评价。
    艾地接着谴责美国对中国的挑衅，并谴责美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
