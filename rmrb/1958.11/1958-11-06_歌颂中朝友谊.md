    Ode to Sino-Korean Friendship
    Guo Moruo
    Passing over Moguili and arriving at Moguili, the road has entered Mount Kumgang. Jade corn hangs under the eaves, and artemisia and cherry blossoms smile by the roadside. The mountains are drunk with autumn, and the sun is haloed by swirling clouds. Standing before the martyrs' monument, fresh flowers offer their fragrance.
  Passing over Wenjing Ridge:
    Mountains line my shoulders, and a waterfall hangs beyond the clouds. The mountain path twists thirty thousand times, and Wenjing is nine layers of heaven. The sea color comes to the sky's edge, and the clear light shines on the vast universe. I have seen much in my life, but I marvel at the scenery beyond compare.
  On the Road to Kumgang Mountain
    Crossing over Wenjing Ridge, the mountain scenery is completely different. Strange peaks add to their gauntness, and red leaves pale beside the verdant pines. Majesty sheds its arrogance, and solemnity reveals its grace. A Song Dynasty poet understood my feelings, wishing to be a Goryeo subject.
    (Note) A Song Dynasty poem says: "I wish to be born in the Goryeo kingdom, to see Mount Kumgang once." This is cherished by Korean comrades. Mount Kumgang is on the east coast, and there is even a Haegeumgang in the sea. With its strange peaks and beautiful scenery, it truly deserves its reputation.
  Touring Manmulsang
    Mountains are adorned with flowered robes, and cold rosy clouds cascade down Jade Stream. Surveying Manmulsang, ranks of immortals stand side by side. Ghost Face Cliff invites dancing thoughts, and Washing Basin awaits inscription. Unable to ascend the perilous heights, I am lost in the mist and rain.
    (Note) "Manmulsang" is one area of Mount Kumgang, with scenic spots such as Three Immortal Peaks, Solitary Immortal Peak, Celestial Maiden Peak, Ghost Face Cliff, Celestial Maiden Washing Basin, and Heavenly Peril Terrace. It rained during the visit, and I heard that ascending Heavenly Peril Terrace requires rappelling down the cliff, so I gave up.
  At Hanxia Village
    After the rain, the pines are even greener, and the peaks line up like painted screens. The warm spring melts warm jade, and the bright stones sparkle like cold stars. A new moon emerges from the heart of heaven, and clear clouds stretch across the mountain peaks. Not because my ears are sharp, but all sounds are truly silent.
  (Note) There is a hot spring near the inn for guests to bathe in, and the water is very warm.
  Thanking the Guarding Soldiers
    A pair of birds flies far away, and the star flag is high on the pole. The division labors to guard us, and we freely tour the battlefield. Friendship is solidified with fresh blood, and we hope to sweep away all foreign stench. Let us ride fine horses together and gallop across the Han River.
  Three Poems on Samilpo
    I
    Clear light shines on Samilpo, a mirror reflecting two worlds. The sea Kumgang is vast, and the cliff head is stained with the blood of martyrs. Thirty-six hibiscus flowers and myriad Maitreya Buddhas. Poems are inscribed on the cave walls, proving that Penglai exists.
    (Note) Samilpo is also a scenic spot within the Mount Kumgang area, a freshwater lake adjacent to the sea. The lake and its surroundings are filled with strange cliffs, like hidden Arhats. You can see Haegeumgang from afar, but it is too close to the military demarcation line, so you can only look but not reach it. During the war, many martyrs were shot and killed here by the American bandits. In a cave, Yang Penglai inscribed: "Thirty-six hibiscus flowers in the mirror, twelve thousand clouds over snail-shell buns (referring to the twelve thousand peaks of Mount Kumgang), a piece of Cangzhou stone in the middle, sleeping together with seafarers." Yang Penglai was a Korean poet during the Ming Dynasty's Jiajing era.
    II
    Everyone praises the Hwarangdo, but where can one find peace and quiet? They can sing, shoot arrows, and ride horses, with both beauty and literary talent. Loyalty and love are held for the home and the country, and gentleness surpasses strength. Three days is too short; I wish to share the earth and heaven forever.
    (Note) During the Tang Dynasty, Korea was divided into three kingdoms: Goguryeo was the strongest, Baekje was second, and Silla was the weakest. Silla promoted the Hwarangdo, initially with women and later with men. They were beautiful and talented, vowing loyalty to the ruler and love for the country, thereby boosting morale. With the help of the Tang Dynasty, Silla destroyed its powerful enemies. Notable Hwarang include Yeongrang, Seulrang, Anxiang, and Namseok. According to legend, the Hwarang once visited this bay, originally planning only a one-day trip, but they lingered for three days due to the beautiful scenery, hence the name Samilpo (Three-Day Bay).
    III
    Fishing by the Immortal Pavilion, I caught a two-inch-long fish.
    Fishing is not for gain, but to coexist without harming things.
    Looking at the sea, I remember the heroes; in the breeze, I recall Yeongrang.
    Releasing the fish into the bay, it departs joyfully.

    Farewell to Mount Kumgang:
    Traveling by car, following the East Sea north to Wonsan, I wrote down what I heard and saw, seven poems.
    I
    Detained for three days, I bid farewell to Hanxia Bridge. The sea and sky are connected, and the mountains rise as high as the sun. White clouds turn into blue birds, and red leaves become stationery. I tell the mountain spirits: My return will not be far off.
    II
    Seeing the vast ocean, a piece of blue glass. A sacred and peaceful realm, sometimes sullied by the atrocities of the American jackals. A person who does not love their country is worse than a beast wearing skin. The bright sun shines only on the brave; fortunately, the heroic spirits come to protect us.
    III
    The azure sky is the same everywhere, and the vastness ripples with gentle waves. Villages rise to celebrate ten thousand years, and three harvests are reaped along the sea. Broken bridges remain as war relics, and farmers sing songs of harvest. Slogans are posted everywhere: Friendship will never be erased.
    IV
    The long journey requires guarding, mobilized by an entire division. Traffic is blocked, and flags line the road. Voices shout "Ten Thousand Years" in unison, and hands are raised thousands of times. Such true friendship, brothers in hardship.
    V
    Driving through Heupgok, I suddenly see Sijung Lake. The lake light connects to the sea color, like a blue jade disc linked to green jade. The land is separated by a narrow strip, and the water is divided into two regions. Alas, the enemy is near, and the beautiful scenery is wasted on hesitation.
    VI
    There is also a Dongting Lake here, with Mount Jun towering in the middle. The pines are green, the sandbars are white, the water is thick, and the sea and sky are wide. Separated by only a few feet from the sea, the fish produced are very colorful. The vacationers can rest comfortably here at the treatment center.
    VII
    The journey grows late, and mountains enter the fog curtains. Village cows rest from their labor, and farm women return carrying baskets. Lights shine through the distant city, and water reflects the remaining glow. Arriving again at Wonsan Station, cheers erupt like thunder.
  Returning to Changsu Garden
    Verdant Changsu Garden, surrounded by pine mountains. A pool reflects like a mirror, and several boats startle on the shore. Fishing yields no fish, and bees hum while collecting honey. Only human warmth, keeping me from feeling the cold late into the night.
    (Note) Changsu Garden is in the suburbs of Pyongyang, where the delegation is staying. There is a reservoir surrounded by mountains, where you can fish and boat, a very quiet place.
    Farewell at Sinuiju
    Farewell today, with a full heart of respect and admiration.
    The country rides the Chollima horse, and the people possess ten thousand pieces of gold.
    The Yalu River flows green, and Mount Paektu sings in harmony.
    After peaceful reunification, we will be together like Shanghai and Yuntai.
                  [End]

    歌颂中朝友谊
    郭沫若
    过末辉里人来末辉里，道已入金刚。玉黍悬檐下，蒿樱笑路旁。秋酣群岳醉，日晕众云狂。烈士碑前立，鲜花当瓣香。
  过温井岭群岳并吾肩，飞泉云外悬。山途三万转，温井九重天。海色来空际，晴光照大千。平生多阅历，景物叹超前。金　刚　山　道　中越过温井岭，山光逈不同。奇峰添瘦骨，红叶逊苍松。雄浑谢骄气，庄严吐秀容。宋人得我意，愿作高丽氓。
    （注）宋人有诗句云：“愿生高丽国，一见金刚山”为朝鲜同志所乐道。金刚山在东海岸上，海中尚有海金刚，奇峰秀色，佳景万千，确实名不虚传。
  游万物相群岳着花衣，寒霞泻玉溪。环观万物相，骈列众仙姿。鬼面崖思舞，洗头盆待题。未能上天险，烟雨望中迷。
    （注）“万物相”为金刚山中之一区域，有三仙峰、独仙峰、天女峰、鬼面崖、天女洗头盆、天险台等胜迹。游时遇雨，闻登天险台须缒崖而上，作罢。
  在寒霞里雨后松增翠，群峰列画屏。温汤融暖玉，皓石灿寒星。新月天心吐，晴云峰顶横。匪缘双听远，万籁实无声。
  （注）旅邸附近有温泉供客浴，水甚温暖。
  谢警卫战士有鸟双飞逈，星旗柱上高。师团劳警卫，战地恣游遨。友谊凝鲜血，心期扫异臊。相将策骏马，驰骋汉江?。
  游三日浦三首
    一晴辉三日浦，镜里二乾坤。海上金刚渺，崖头碧血熏。芙蓉卅六朵，弥勒万千尊。洞壁题诗在，蓬莱信有文。
    （注）三日浦亦金刚山区域内一胜境，乃一淡水湖，与海为邻。湖中与四周多奇崖，如躲体罗汉。可遥望海金刚，但因离军事分界线过近，可望而不可及。战时，烈士多在此被美寇枪杀。一岩洞中有杨蓬莱题壁云“镜里芙蓉三十六，云过螺髻万二千（案指金刚山万二千峰），中间一片沧州石，合着同来海客眠”。杨蓬莱乃明嘉靖时朝鲜诗人。
    二艳说花郎道，何处觅安详？能歌能射御，有貌有文章。忠爱持家国，柔弱胜刚强。三日殊嫌短，愿共地天长。
    （注）唐时朝鲜分为三国，高句丽最强，百济次之，新罗最弱。新罗奖励花郎道，初以女姓为花郎，后以男姓为之。美貌多才，矢志忠君爱国，以此鼓舞士气。新罗得唐助，竟灭亡其强敌。花郎有名可考者为永郎、述郎、安详、南石等四人。据传说。花郎曾游此浦，原只作一日游，因风景优美，竟流连三日，故有三日浦之名。
    三
    垂钓仙亭畔，得鱼二寸长。
    钓鱼非有为，与物在无伤。
    望海怀英烈，临风忆永郎。
    释鱼入浦水，其逝乐洋洋。告别金刚山，乘汽车遵东海而北，赴元山市，途中书所闻所见，七首。
    一羁留亘三日，告别寒霞桥。海与天相接，山同日共高。白云化青鸟，红叶作笺条。寄语山灵道：再来谅匪遥。
    二汪洋见大海，一片碧琉璃。圣洁和平境，时污虎伥蹄。人而不爱国，兽也竟蒙皮。白日昭昭只，英灵幸来仪。
    三苍天无二色，溟涬漾微波。万岁逢村起，三时遵海过。断桥遗战迹，滞穗起农歌。到处题标语：友情永不磨。四长途劳警卫，发动一师团。车辆交通断，旌旗夹道看。同声呼万岁，举手累千番。如此真情谊，弟兄又二难。五驱车过歙谷，忽见侍中湖。湖光接海色，苍璧联青玞。土隔一衣带，水分两具区。惜哉寇在迩，美景费踌蹰。六亦有洞庭在，湖中耸君山。松青沙渚白，水厚海天宽。隔海仅寻丈，产鱼甚斑斓。行兴疗养院，劳者好盘桓。七行道日将晚，山山入雾帷。村牛息驾待，农妇戴盆归。灯光透远市，水色映余辉。又到元山站，欢呼腾万雷。
  回长寿园苍苍长寿园，四望尽松山。一水塘中镜，数艘岸畔惊。钓鱼鱼不至，采蜜蜜蜂喧。只为人情暖，宵深不觉寒。
    （注）长寿园在平壤郊外，代表团住宿于此。有一水库为众山环绕，可钓鱼弄舟，地甚清静。
    在新义州告别
    告别在今日，钦迟意满怀。
    国骑千里马，人具万金财。
    鸭绿江流碧，白头山颂谐。
    和平统一后，同上海云台。
                  〔完〕
