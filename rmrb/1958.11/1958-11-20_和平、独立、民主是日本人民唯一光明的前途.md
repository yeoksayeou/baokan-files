Since the beginning of October, the Japanese government of Nobusuke Kishi and the U.S. government have begun negotiations in Tokyo on the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." Although both sides have been tight-lipped about the content of these negotiations, news from sources close to both governments confirms that the purpose of this negotiation is to exploit the Japanese people's desire for independence under the guise of revising the treaty, in order to conclude a bilateral U.S.-Japan military alliance. U.S. imperialism is attempting to use the so-called "common defense" rope to bind Japan more tightly to its war chariot, making Japan a tool for U.S. aggression in Asia, in order to realize its conspiracy of using Asians to fight Asians. The Kishi Nobusuke government, on the other hand, attempts to revive Japanese militarism through further military collusion with the United States, suppress the peace and democracy forces in Japan, and realize the ambition of Japanese monopoly capital to meddle in Taiwan and expand into Southeast Asia. If this conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries succeeds, not only will Japan be dragged onto the path of war and aggression, but also the security of our country and the peace of Asia will be seriously threatened. The Chinese people cannot but express deep concern about this and issue solemn warnings. We fully support the statement made by our Foreign Minister Chen Yi regarding the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." We believe that this statement not only accurately reflects the position of the Chinese people, but also expresses the Chinese people's deep desire for the Japanese people to embark on a bright future.

After World War II, the Chinese people, who had suffered deeply from imperialist aggression and oppression, hoped that their neighbor, Japan, would become a peaceful, independent, and democratic country. Moreover, the Chinese people have always believed that a peaceful and democratic Japan must first be an independent Japan. As early as October 1954, the joint declaration issued by the Chinese and Soviet governments pointed out that "after the end of the Second World War, according to the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement, Japan should obtain complete national independence, establish its own democratic system, and develop its own independent peaceful economy and national culture." The attitude towards Japan expressed in the Sino-Soviet joint declaration is based on the principle that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully, and it fully conforms to the expectations of the people of all countries who have suffered from the scourge of Japanese imperialism.

However, post-war Japan has remained under the semi-occupation of U.S. imperialism. The United States has used various unequal treaties, primarily the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," to implement comprehensive military, economic, and political control over Japan, seriously undermining Japan's sovereignty and independence. U.S. troops have been stationed in Japan for a long time, and the United States has established military bases everywhere in mainland Japan and Okinawa and Ogasawara. It is very clear to everyone that whether it was during the U.S. launch of the war of aggression against Korea in 1950 or during the recent war provocations launched by the United States against our country in the Taiwan Strait, Japan has been a base for U.S. military operations and supplies. Japan has been increasingly drawn closer to the brink of war created by the United States.

The peace-loving Japanese people have waged a series of struggles to break free from U.S. control and strive for national independence. The Japanese people demand the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the withdrawal of all U.S. military bases and all U.S. armed forces from Japanese territory, including Okinawa and Ogasawara. This call has been growing louder recently. The Chinese people fully sympathize with and support these legitimate demands of the Japanese people and sincerely hope that these demands of the Japanese people can be realized through the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" or on the premise that the United States withdraws all bases and all armed forces from Japanese territory, and sign a truly equal U.S.-Japan treaty. However, the treaty revision negotiations now underway between the United States and the Kishi Nobusuke government are a completely different matter. According to the U.S. plan, the revised U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is by no means an equal treaty, but a treaty that will make Japan lose its independence and be more subservient to the U.S. war policy. The United States will not only not withdraw its military bases from Japan and its armed forces, but also demands that Japan help defend U.S. military bases, and when necessary, requires Japan to send troops to any part of the Western Pacific to act as cannon fodder for U.S. aggression, to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the United States. It is clear that a Japan that has lost its independence and is subservient to the United States can never achieve peace; on the contrary, it will be dragged step by step by the United States into a nuclear war, and ultimately become a victim of U.S. aggression.

Similarly, a democratic Japan must first be an independent Japan. U.S. imperialism, in order to permanently control Japan and drag Japan onto the old path of war and aggression, will never allow the Japanese people to embark on the path of peace and democracy. On the contrary, the United States has been supporting the most reactionary forces in Japan to carry out activities to revive militarism. Hasn't Japan's militaristic forces been regaining ground in recent years? And recent developments have become particularly obvious. In order to suppress domestic peace and democracy forces and clear obstacles to the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the Kishi Nobusuke government is recklessly attempting to forcibly pass the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment," making Japan a militaristic police state once again. A Kishi Nobusuke who acts according to the will of the United States will never lead Japan on the path of democracy, but only on the path of Fascism. And a Fascist Japan can never take the path of peace, but only the path of war. Isn't the lesson taught to the Japanese people by the long rule of Japan by militarists before the war painful enough?

Now, the reactionary face of Kishi Nobusuke has been completely exposed, and his latent imperialist policies have become overt and public. Kishi Nobusuke is leading Japan down a path that is completely contrary to the will of the Japanese people, which is to further rely on the United States and retrace the old path of militarism and imperialism. Kishi Nobusuke is willing to gamble with the interests of the Japanese people and the Japanese nation to further engage in military collusion with the United States. Kishi Nobusuke believes that in this way, he can exchange for U.S. assistance to the Japanese reactionaries' plan to rebuild the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," and he can solve the increasingly deepening Japanese economic crisis, and regain dominance in Asia. In fact, this is simply wishful thinking. What the Japanese reactionaries face today is a new China that is unprecedentedly united and strong, and no longer the old China of twenty years ago that was divided and weak; it is a group of emerging socialist and nationalist countries in Asia, and no longer the colonies and semi-colonies that could be slaughtered by others twenty years ago. We must solemnly warn the likes of Kishi Nobusuke that you cannot touch the great China, nor can you bully the people of the awakened Southeast Asian countries. Kishi Nobusuke may think that things will be different by getting on the U.S. ship. In fact, in the angry tide of the Chinese people and the people of the world opposing U.S. aggression, the U.S. ship is sinking. Can there be a way out by getting on this ship? The U.S. paper tiger is not worth mentioning, what can the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries added together amount to? The lifespan of your master, U.S. imperialism, is not long, and the result of you helping the United States as an accomplice will only make you fail faster, and there will be no better end.

For Japan, the only bright path is to establish equal and mutually beneficial economic relations with all countries in the world, especially Asian countries, and to develop together, prosper together, and coexist peacefully as an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral country. However, to realize this path, the Japanese people must first break free from U.S. control, abolish unequal treaties between the U.S. and Japan, end the U.S. occupation of Japan, and maintain an equal relationship between the U.S. and Japan as two independent countries. Only a truly independent Japan can practice democracy internally and peace and neutrality externally.

The Chinese people sincerely hope to establish long-term friendly relations with an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral Japan. The Chinese people not only hope that Japan can coexist peacefully and be friendly with China and other Asian countries, but also never oppose Japan's peaceful coexistence and friendship with the United States on an equal basis.

At the same time, the Chinese people never oppose an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral Japan having self-defense armed forces. And we believe that such self-defense armed forces will contribute to safeguarding Japan's independence.

The Chinese people have always advocated that an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral Japan should establish equal and mutually beneficial economic relations with China and other Asian countries. Japan is an Asian country that industrialized relatively early and is also a country with relatively developed foreign trade. Japan's main market is not and cannot be in the United States. The result of Japan's economic dependence on the United States after the war has not brought any benefits to Japan; on the contrary, the United States has used Japan's economic weaknesses to make Japan suffer a great loss. If Japan truly embarks on the path of peace, independence, and democracy, and abandons its ambition for economic expansion, Japan can fully seek common economic development with other Asian countries within the scope of the Asian family, in accordance with the principles of equality, mutual benefit, mutual exchange, and friendly cooperation. Japan can also find a reasonable way out economically.

In order to strive for Japan's peace, independence, and democracy, and to oppose Kishi Nobusuke's reliance on the United States to drag Japan onto the old path of militarism and imperialism, the Japanese people have launched a magnificent struggle. The scale, participation of various classes, and momentum of this struggle are unprecedented in post-war Japanese history. Now, not only the vast Japanese working people, intellectuals, and middle and small bourgeoisie are enthusiastically participating in this struggle, but even some insightful people within the Liberal Democratic Party have stood up to criticize Kishi Nobusuke's reactionary policies. The Japanese reactionaries have fallen into an unprecedentedly isolated and embarrassed situation under the blows of the Japanese people. This fully shows how weak the Japanese reactionaries, headed by Kishi Nobusuke, are. Their perverse actions and temporary arrogance cannot save their doom, but will only arouse the Japanese people's more resolute struggle against them. The Chinese people warmly support the just struggle of the Japanese people. We believe that the Japanese nation with its tradition of independence will never allow the United States to ride on its head forever. Although there will be many difficulties on the road ahead, the hardworking, brave, and wise Japanese people will surely be able to overcome all the attacks of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and embark on their bright future of peace, independence, and democracy.

### 和平、独立、民主是日本人民唯一光明的前途

    和平、独立、民主是日本人民唯一光明的前途
    从10月初旬起，日本岸信介政府和美国政府，在东京就修改日美“安全条约”问题，开始了谈判。尽管双方对这一谈判的内容都讳莫如深，但是，接近双方政府的人士透露出来的消息，已经可以证实，这次谈判的目的，是企图利用日本人民渴望独立的心情，借修改条约为名，缔结双边的日美军事同盟。美帝国主义企图利用所谓“共同防御”的绳索，把日本更紧地绑在自己的战车上，使日本成为美国在亚洲进行侵略的工具，以便实现它利用亚洲人打亚洲人的阴谋。而岸信介政府则企图利用同美国进一步的军事勾结，复活日本军国主义，镇压日本的和平民主力量，实现日本垄断资本染指台湾和向东南亚扩张的野心。如果美日反动派的这一阴谋得逞，不仅日本将被拖上战争和侵略的道路，同时我国的安全和亚洲的和平也将受到严重的威胁。中国人民不能不对此表示深刻的关切和提出严正的警告。我们完全拥护我国外交部长陈毅关于日美修改“安全条约”的声明。我们认为这个声明不仅确切地反映了中国人民的立场，而且也表达了中国人民期待日本人民走上光明前途的深切愿望。
    在二次大战以后，深受帝国主义侵略和压迫之苦的中国人民，希望自己的近邻日本将会成为一个和平、独立、民主的国家。而且中国人民一贯认为，一个和平、民主的日本首先必须是一个独立的日本。早在1954年10月，中苏两国政府发表的联合宣言就已经指出：“第二次世界大战结束后，根据波茨坦协定的规定，日本应当得到完全的民族独立，建立自己的民主制度，发展自己独立的和平经济和民族文化。”中苏联合宣言所表明的对日本的态度，是从不同社会制度的国家可以和平共处的原则出发的，是完全符合受日本帝国主义祸害的各国人民对日本的期望的。
    但是，战后的日本却一直处在美帝国主义的半占领状态之下。美国用各种不平等条约首先是日美“安全条约”，对日本实施军事、经济、政治的全面控制，严重地损害了日本的主权和独立。美国的军队长期驻扎在日本，美国在日本本土和冲绳、小笠原到处设立军事基地。谁都看得很清楚，不管是1950年美国发动侵朝战争期间也好，或者是这次美国在台湾海峡地区向我国发动战争挑衅期间也好，日本都是美军的作战和供应基地。日本已经越来越被美国带近它所制造的战争边缘。
    爱好和平的日本人民，为了摆脱美国控制，争取民族独立，曾经进行了一系列的斗争。日本人民要求废除日美“安全条约”，要求从日本领土上，包括冲绳和小笠原在内，撤消美国的一切军事基地和撤退美国的一切武装力量。这种呼声最近是越来越高了。中国人民完全同情和支持日本人民的这些正当要求，并且衷心地希望日本人民的这些要求，能够通过废除日美“安全条约”或者在美国从日本领土上撤消一切基地和撤退一切武装力量的前提下，签订一个真正平等的日美条约而得到实现。但是，这次美国和岸信介政府所进行的修改条约的谈判却完全是另外一回事。按照美国的打算，修改后的日美“安全条约”，绝不是一个什么平等的条约，而是一个使日本更加丧失独立和更加屈从于美国的战争政策的条约。美国不仅不会从日本撤消它的军事基地，撤退它的武装力量，而且还要求日本帮助防守美国的军事基地，并且在必要的时候，要求日本派军队到西太平洋的任何地方，充当美国侵略的炮灰，为美国火中取栗。由此可见，一个丧失独立、屈从美国的日本，绝不可能得到和平；相反的，只会一步一步地被美国牵着鼻子拖进一场核武器的战争，最后成为美国侵略战争的牺牲品。
    同样的，一个民主的日本也首先必须是一个独立的日本。美帝国主义为了永远控制日本和把日本拖上战争和侵略的老路，是决不容许日本人民走上和平、民主的道路的。相反的，美国一直在支持日本最反动的势力，进行复活军国主义的活动。近几年来，日本的军国主义势力不是正在重新得势吗？而最近的事情发展得格外明显。岸信介政府为了镇压国内的和平、民主力量，扫清修改日美“安全条约”的障碍，正在不顾一切地企图强行通过“警察官职务执行法修正案”，使日本重新成为一个军国主义的警察国家。一个秉承美国意志办事的岸信介绝不会把日本引上民主的道路，只会把日本引上法西斯化的道路。而一个法西斯化的日本绝不可能走和平的道路，只会走战争的道路。难道战前日本军国主义分子长期统治日本所给予日本人民的教训还不够惨痛吗？
    现在，岸信介的反动面目已经彻底暴露了，他的潜在的帝国主义政策已经表面化，公开化了。岸信介正在把日本引上一条和日本人民的意志完全相反的道路，这就是进一步投靠美国，重走军国主义和帝国主义的老路。岸信介不惜以日本人民和日本民族的利益做赌注，进一步同美国实行军事勾结。岸信介自以为这样，就可以换取美国对日本反动派重建“大东亚共荣圈”的侵略计划的协助，就可以解救越陷越深的日本经济危机，就可以重霸亚洲。其实这简直是痴人说梦。今天日本反动派所面临的是一个空前团结和强大的新中国，而不再是二十年前那个分裂和孱弱的旧中国；是一批亚洲新兴的社会主义国家和民族主义国家，而不再是二十年前那些可以任人宰割的殖民地和半殖民地。我们必须严正地警告岸信介之流，你们不仅碰不动伟大的中国，而且也欺负不了觉醒了的东南亚各国的人民。岸信介也许认为搭上美国这条船，情况就会不同。其实，在中国人民和世界人民反对美国侵略的怒涛中，美国这条船正在往下沉，搭上这条船能够有出路吗？美国这只纸老虎都不在话下，美日反动派加在一起，又算得了什么？你们的主子美帝国主义的寿命已经不长了，你们替美国帮凶的结果，除了使你们失败得更快以外，绝不会有什么更好的下场。
    对日本来说，唯一光明的道路，是作为一个独立的、民主的、和平中立的国家，同世界各国首先是亚洲各国，建立平等互利的经济关系，共同发展，共同繁荣，和平相处。但是，要实现这条道路，日本人民就必须首先摆脱美国的控制，废除美日间的不平等条约，结束美国对日本的占领状态，使日美之间保持两个独立国家之间的平等关系。只有一个真正独立的日本，才有可能对内实行民主，对外实行和平中立。
    中国人民衷心地期望，同一个独立的、民主的、和平中立的日本，建立长期的友好关系。中国人民不仅希望日本能够同中国和亚洲各国和平共处，相互友好，而且从来也不反对日本同美国在平等的基础上和平共处，相互友好。
    同时，中国人民从来不反对一个独立的、民主的、和平中立的日本拥有自卫武装。而且我们相信，这种自卫武装将会对保卫日本的独立做出贡献。
    中国人民一向主张，一个独立的、民主的、和平中立的日本应该同中国和亚洲各国建立平等互利的经济关系。日本是一个亚洲工业化较早的国家，同时又是一个对外贸易相当发达的国家。日本的主要市场并不是，也不可能在美国。战后日本在经济上依附美国的结果，并没有给日本带来什么好处；相反的，美国却利用了日本经济的弱点，使日本吃了很大的亏。如果，日本真正走上和平、独立、民主的道路，放弃经济扩张的野心，日本就完全可以在亚洲大家庭的范围内，按照平等互利、互通有无和友好合作的原则，同亚洲各国一起，求得经济上的共同发展。日本在经济上也就可能找到合理的出路。
    为了争取日本的和平、独立、民主，为了反对岸信介投靠美国把日本拖上军国主义和帝国主义的老路，日本人民已经展开了波澜壮阔的斗争，这个斗争规模之大、参加的阶层之广和声势之壮，在战后日本历史上都是空前的。现在不仅广大的日本劳动人民、知识分子和中、小资产阶级踊跃地参加了这个斗争，就连自由民主党内部的某些有识之士也起来指责岸信介的反动政策。日本反动派已经在日本人民的打击下陷于空前孤立和狼狈的境地。这就充分说明，以岸信介为首的日本反动派是多么的虚弱，他们的倒行逆施和一时的猖獗，绝不能挽救他们的厄运，而只会激起日本人民对他们更坚决的斗争。中国人民热烈支持日本人民的正义斗争，我们相信，具有独立传统的日本民族，决不会容许美国永远骑在它的头上。尽管在前进的道路上还会遇到很多困难，但是勤劳、勇敢、智慧的日本人民，一定能够战胜美日反动派的一切进攻，走上他们和平、独立、民主的光明前途。
