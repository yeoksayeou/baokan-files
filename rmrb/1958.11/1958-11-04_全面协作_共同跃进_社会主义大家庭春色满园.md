Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd. Our correspondent reports: As the working people of socialist countries welcome the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution, they face a scene of great development and continuous leaps in the economy. At present, the proportion of the socialist camp's industrial output in the world's total industrial output has increased from about 33% last year to 38% to 40% this year. The socialist camp accounts for 38% of the world's coal production, more than 25% of steel and iron smelting, 33% of cotton, and 20% of electricity and cement.

The socialist camp is vast and rich in natural resources, with coal reserves accounting for more than 60% of the world, iron ore accounting for 50%, potash minerals accounting for 75%, and even richer water resources.

In the economic competition between the two camps, the most characteristic and significant fact of the socialist camp's economic growth is that the speed of increasing production levels has greatly surpassed that of capitalist countries. Recently, the Soviet press published the following statistics, which best illustrate the problem: If 1937 is taken as the base year, the industrial production of the socialist camp has increased three and a half times in the past twenty years, while the capitalist countries have only increased one time. During these twenty years, a considerable part of the time of the socialist camp countries was spent in war, revolutionary struggles, and economic recovery. The difference in the growth rate of industrial output between the two camps is getting bigger year by year.

Recently, countries in the socialist camp have been using the spirit of great development and have been riding on fast horses one after another. The Soviet Union is striving to catch up with and surpass the United States, China is also catching up with the United Kingdom, and East Germany wants to overwhelm West Germany. In the first three quarters of this year, other people's democratic countries in Europe and Asia have successfully completed their economic construction plans.

This year, many countries in the socialist camp have successively formulated brilliant plans for further great development. The Soviet Union's seven-year perspective plan for the development of the national economy is about to be announced, which is a plan to bring the Soviet Union's production capacity very close to that of the United States. Czechoslovakia's second five-year plan stipulates that industrial production in 1960 will increase by more than half compared with 1955. Poland's seven-year plan from 1959 to 1965 stipulates that industrial products will increase by 80% and agricultural products will increase by 30% within seven years compared with 1958. The Bulgarian people are striving to complete the third five-year plan (1958-1962) one or two years ahead of schedule.

Socialist camp countries have fully developed the internationalist spirit of mutual cooperation and coordination in economic construction. Soviet loans to various people's democratic countries in the post-war years amounted to more than 28 billion rubles. The Soviet Union has helped various people's democratic countries build 500 large industrial enterprises. These enterprises can produce 23 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 15 million tons of steel, more than 4 million tons of oil and other products every year. Trade and scientific, technological and cultural cooperation among socialist camp countries are strengthening every year. The socialist camp strives to advance side by side with the spirit of full cooperation and collective strength. (Attached pictures)

### 全面协作　共同跃进  社会主义大家庭春色满园

    全面协作　共同跃进
    社会主义大家庭春色满园
    新华社莫斯科2日电　本社记者报道：在社会主义阵营各国劳动人民迎接十月革命四十一周年的时候面临着的景象是：大家都在大发展，经济不断飞跃上升。目前，社会主义阵营工业产量在世界工业总产量中的比重已由去年的33％左右提高到今年的38％到40％。社会主义阵营的煤产量占世界的38％，炼钢、炼铁占25％还多，棉花占33％，电力和水泥占20％。
    社会主义阵营地大物博，自然资源非常丰富，煤储量占世界的60％多，铁矿占50％，钾盐类矿物占75％，水力资源更加丰富。
    在两个阵营经济竞赛中，社会主义阵营经济成长的最富有特征、最有重要意义的事实是生产水平提高的速度大大压倒了资本主义国家。最近，苏联报刊发表了下面最能说明问题的统计材料：如果以1937年为基数，二十年来社会主义阵营的工业生产增加了三倍半，而资本主义国家只增加了一倍。在这二十年中，社会主义阵营国家相当大的一部分时间是在战争、革命斗争、经济恢复当中度过的。两个阵营工业产量增长的速度上的差别一年比一年大。
    最近以来，社会主义阵营各国都用大发展的精神，一个接着一个跨上了千里马。苏联向着赶上和超过美国的目标奋勇直进，中国也在追赶英国，民主德国要压倒西德。今年头三个季度，欧、亚两洲其他人民民主国家都顺利地完成了经济建设计划。
    今年社会主义阵营许多国家都陆续在制订更进一步大发展的辉煌计划。苏联的发展国民经济七年远景计划即将公布，这是一个使苏联生产能力十分接近美国的规划。捷克斯洛伐克的第二个五年计划规定1960年的工业生产将比1955年增加一半以上。波兰的1959年到1965年的七年计划规定在七年内工业产品将比1958年增加80％，农业产品增加30％。保加利亚人民正在争取提前一、两年完成第三个五年计划（1958—1962年）。
    社会主义阵营国家在经济建设中充分发挥了互相合作、彼此配合的国际主义精神。苏联在战后年代援助各人民民主国家的贷款在二百八十亿卢布以上。苏联帮助各人民民主国家建设的大工业企业有五百个。这些企业每年能生产二百三十亿度电、一千五百万吨钢、四百多万吨石油及其他产品。社会主义阵营各国间的贸易和科学技术文化合作，每年都在加强。社会主义阵营用充分协作的精神和集体力量奋力齐头并进。（附图片）
