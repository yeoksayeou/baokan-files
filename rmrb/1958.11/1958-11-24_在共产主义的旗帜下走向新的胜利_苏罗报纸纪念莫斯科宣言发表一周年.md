Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 22nd: Moscow newspapers today published editorials and articles commemorating the first anniversary of the declarations adopted at the Moscow Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties.

    “Pravda” published an editorial today entitled "Under the Great Banner of Marxism-Leninism." The editorial stated that the Moscow Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties held a year ago "was the most representative and extensive meeting in the history of the international communist movement. This meeting convincingly demonstrated the unity of the socialist camp and the entire international communist movement on the basis of Marxism-Leninism."

    The editorial said that the Declaration passed by the representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries and the Peace Manifesto passed by the representatives of sixty-four Communist and Workers' Parties are two documents with tremendous mobilizing and organizing power. These two documents creatively summarized the collective experience of the Communist and Workers' Parties from a Marxist-Leninist standpoint and pointed out the tasks of the communist movement at the current stage in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

    The editorial pointed out that in the year since the Moscow Meeting, the international communist movement has become more united, the people of the socialist camp have continuously achieved new and brilliant victories, and the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism throughout the world have grown stronger. The past year has been a year of further unity among the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, and a year of their ideological and organizational unity under the banner of Marxism-Leninism.

    The editorial then said that the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries have consistently implemented the principles of the Declaration, and as a result, their cooperation has become closer and their actions in strengthening the socialist camp have become more unified, which has had a huge impact on the entire course of world events.

    In our era, the development of the world depends on the progress and outcome of the competition between two opposing social systems. The vibrant socialist system is booming, showing incomparable superiority over the decadent and moribund capitalist system. Under the leadership of the Communist and Workers' Parties, the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries in Europe and Asia are constantly achieving new successes in economic and cultural development and in improving the material welfare of the working people. In this regard, the mutual exchange of experience, the adoption of unified actions, the sending of party and government delegations to fraternal countries for visits, and the sending of party delegations to attend the congresses of Communist and Workers' Parties in other countries are of great significance.

    The editorial said: "The people of socialist countries and all progressive mankind welcome with great satisfaction the communiqué of the meeting between Comrade Khrushchev and Comrade Mao Zedong in Beijing in July and August 1958, because they believe that the unity and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are not only a guarantee for these two countries to leap forward on the road of socialism and communism, but also a guarantee for strengthening the power of the entire socialist camp."

    The editorial pointed out that the extensive economic and cultural cooperation established between the socialist countries is based on complete equality and comradely mutual assistance. The meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance held in May 1958 opened a new and higher stage of economic cooperation among the socialist countries. This stage is to further strengthen the international division of labor among socialist countries, coordinate the development plans of relevant departments, and strengthen cooperation and specialization in industrial production.

    The editorial said that the two declarations adopted at the Moscow Meeting play a huge role in the development and strengthening of the entire international communist and workers' movement. They armed all Marxist-Leninist working-class parties with a clear program for striving for peace, for the living rights of the working people, for democracy, national independence, and socialism.

    The editorial emphasized that the Communist Parties of all countries have demonstrated their loyalty to the banner of Marxism-Leninism and their high ideological and political maturity in the irreconcilable and principled struggle against revisionism. Modern revisionism attempts to discredit the great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism and to erode its revolutionary spirit. This revisionism is most fully reflected in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and in the statements of the leaders of this League. All revolutionary parties of the working class consider the LCY program to be a revisionist program and severely condemn the destructive and divisive activities of the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

    Referring to the Peace Manifesto, the editorial said that this manifesto, in enthusiastic language, convinces the people of all countries that war can be avoided and encourages them to fight for the maintenance and consolidation of peace. It has been warmly received by all good people around the world. Recently, the imperialists have repeatedly attempted to launch wars in various countries around the world, but have been stopped by the forces of the socialist countries and all peace-loving countries and people. Now everyone sees that the imperialist policy of brinkmanship and arms race, hated by the people of all countries, is being completely defeated.

    Kusinen, member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee, published an article in "Pravda" saying: "In the past year, the international communist movement as a whole has undeniably been consolidated." He said that contrary to the wishes of the revisionists, in this year, the socialist countries have further strengthened their rock-solid unity, the ties between fraternal parties have been further expanded, and the conspiracies of international reactionaries to alienate socialist countries have all failed.

    When talking about the great significance of the Moscow Declaration of the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries, Kusinen said: "The greatest achievement of this Declaration lies in: it opposes the distortion of revisionism, defends the internationalist principles of communism, and establishes the correct relationship between the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the specific national and historical conditions of various countries."

    An article in "Izvestia" entitled "Socialism is the Rising World System" said: "In the year since the Moscow Meeting, the power of the world socialist system has been growing, while the imperialist system has continued to decline and decay." The characteristic of socialist development at the present stage is that a series of people's democratic countries have entered the period of completion of socialist construction. The unity of the socialist countries and the development of comprehensive fraternal cooperation between them guarantee the universal upsurge of the socialist economy. The article then said that the characteristic of the international communist movement at the present stage is first of all the unity of this movement and the growth of the strength, prestige, and influence of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries. The united action of the Communist Parties of all countries in the struggle against modern revisionism is a shining proof of the unity of the international communist movement.

    In addition, "Trud" and "Krasnaya Zvezda" also published commemorative articles today.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, November 22nd: Romanian newspapers "Scinteia," "Romania Libera," "Munca," and "Scinteia Tineretului" today published articles commemorating the first anniversary of the publication of the two declarations of the Moscow Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties.

    The article in "Scinteia" said: "The Moscow Meeting and the documents adopted at the meeting mark the victory of the principles of proletarian internationalism, demonstrate the ideological unity of the Communist Parties of all countries, and indicate that the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the unity of the international communist movement have entered a new stage of development."

    "Scinteia" said that the discussion of the Moscow Meeting documents by the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries promoted the improvement of ideological work, promoted the development of creative Marxist-Leninist thought, and improved the fighting will of communists in the struggle against bourgeois ideology and its influence, in the struggle against opportunist trends in the workers' movement, and in the struggle to defend the purity of Marxist-Leninist doctrine. The actual situation shows that the view that the Communist and Workers' Party representatives attending the meeting believed that the main danger that the workers' movement should pay attention to and be vigilant against is revisionism is correct. The article said that the arguments of modern revisionism are concentrated in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. Only international reactionaries would welcome such arguments. And the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries fundamentally disagree with such arguments.

    "Scinteia" finally said that the documents of the Moscow Meeting are a strong support for the international communist movement in solving the problems of building a new society—a socialist society—and a strong support for defending peace. No force can stop mankind from advancing towards socialism. The Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries are constantly strengthening their fraternal unity under the banner of proletarian internationalism, and they are leading hundreds of millions of people to strive for world peace and the victory of socialism.

    在共产主义的旗帜下走向新的胜利
    苏罗报纸纪念莫斯科宣言发表一周年
    据新华社莫斯科22日电　莫斯科各报今天发表社论和文章，纪念各国共产党和工人党代表莫斯科会议所通过的两个宣言发表一周年。
    “真理报”今天发表了题为“在马克思列宁主义的伟大旗帜下”的社论。社论说，一年前在莫斯科举行的各国共产党和工人党代表会议，“是国际共产主义运动历史上最有代表性的、最广泛的一次会议。这次会议令人信服地显示出社会主义阵营和整个国际共产主义运动在马克思列宁主义基础上的团结”。
    社论说，社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议通过的宣言和六十四个共产党和工人党代表会议通过的和平宣言，是两个具有巨大动员力量和组织力量的文件。这两个文件以马克思列宁主义的立场创造性地总结了共产党和工人党的集体经验，指出了共产主义运动现阶段在争取和平、民主和社会主义斗争中的任务。
    社论指出，莫斯科会议召开以后的一年来，国际共产主义运动更加团结了，社会主义阵营各国人民不断取得新的辉煌的胜利，全世界的和平、民主和社会主义力量在发展壮大。过去的一年是各国共产党和工人党进一步团结的一年，是它们的队伍在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下在思想上和组织上团结的一年。
    社论接着说，社会主义国家共产党和工人党始终不渝地贯彻宣言的原则，因而它们的合作更加密切了，它们在加强社会主义阵营方面的行动更加一致了，这对世界事态的整个进程有着巨大的影响。
    在我们的时代，世界的发展取决于两个对立的社会制度的竞赛的进程和结果。充满生命力的社会主义体系正处在蓬勃发展之中，它显示出对腐朽的日暮途穷的资本主义体系具有无比的优越性。苏联、中国以及欧亚两洲其他社会主义国家的人民在共产党和工人党的领导下，在经济和文化发展方面，在增进劳动人民物质福利方面不断地取得新的成就。在这方面，各国共产党相互交流经验，采取一致行动，派遣党和政府代表团到兄弟国家去访问和派遣党的代表团参加其他国家共产党和工人党的代表大会，具有重大的意义。
    社论说：“社会主义各国人民和全体进步人类怀着十分满意的心情欢迎赫鲁晓夫同志和毛泽东同志1958年7、8月间在北京举行会谈的公报，因为他们认为，苏联和中华人民共和国的团结和合作不仅是这两个国家沿着社会主义和共产主义道路飞跃前进的保证，而且也是加强整个社会主义阵营威力的保证。”
    社论指出，社会主义阵营各国之间建立的广泛的经济和文化合作，是以完全平等和同志式的互助为基础的。1958年5月举行的经济互助委员会参加国共产党和工人党代表会议，开辟了社会主义阵营各国经济合作的新的更高的阶段。这个阶段就是进一步加强社会主义国家之间的劳动的国际分工，使有关部门的发展计划相互配合，加强工业生产中的协作和专业分工。
    社论说，莫斯科会议所通过的两个宣言在发展和加强整个国际共产主义运动和工人运动方面起着巨大的作用。它们用争取和平、争取劳动人民的生活权利、争取民主、民族独立和社会主义的明确纲领武装了所有马克思列宁主义的工人阶级政党。
    社论强调说，各国共产党在反对修正主义的不调和的、原则性的斗争中表现了对马克思列宁主义旗帜的忠诚，表现了高度的思想性和政治上的成熟。现代修正主义企图诋毁马克思列宁主义的伟大学说，企图腐蚀这个学说的革命精神，这种修正主义在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领和这个联盟领导人的言论中得到了最全面的反映。一切工人阶级的革命政党都认为南共纲领是修正主义的纲领，并且严厉地谴责南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导人的破坏和分裂活动。
    社论谈到和平宣言时说，这个宣言以热情的语言使各国人民相信战争是可以避免的，鼓舞他们为维护和巩固和平而斗争，它得到全世界一切善良人们最热烈的响应。最近以来，帝国主义者一再企图在世界各国发动战争，但是都被社会主义国家、一切爱好和平的国家和人民的力量制止住了。现在大家都看到，各国人民所憎恨的帝国主义的战争边缘政策、军备竞赛政策正在遭到彻底的失败。
    苏共中央主席团委员库西宁在“真理报”上发表文章说：“在过去一年中，国际共产主义运动整个来说是无可争辩地巩固了。”他说，和修正主义者的愿望相反，在这一年中，社会主义国家进一步加强了磐石般的团结，各兄弟党之间的联系进一步扩大了，国际反动派想离间社会主义国家的阴谋都落空了。
    在谈到社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表莫斯科会议宣言的伟大意义时，库西宁说：“这个宣言的最大功绩在于：它反对了修正主义的歪曲，保卫了共产主义的国际主义原则，确立了马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同各国具体的民族和历史条件之间的正确关系。”
    “消息报”发表题为“社会主义是上升的世界体系”的文章说：“在莫斯科会议召开以来的一年中，世界社会主义体系的威力一直在增长，而帝国主义体系则在继续没落和衰退。”社会主义发展在现阶段的特点是：一系列的人民民主国家已进入了社会主义建设完成的时期。社会主义国家的团结一致，它们之间的全面的兄弟合作的发展，保证了社会主义经济普遍高涨。文章接着说，国际共产主义运动现阶段的特点首先是，这个运动的团结和各国共产党和工人党的力量、威信和影响的增长。各国共产党在反对现代修正主义的斗争中的统一行动，是国际共产主义运动团结的光辉证明。
    此外，“劳动报”和“红星报”在今天也分别发表了纪念文章。
    新华社布加勒斯特22日电　罗马尼亚“火花报”、“自由罗马尼亚报”、“劳动报”、“青年火花报”今天都发表文章，纪念各国共产党和工人党代表莫斯科会议两个宣言发表一周年。
    “火花报”的文章说：“莫斯科会议和会议所通过的文件标志着无产阶级国际主义原则的胜利，证明了各国共产党意识形态上的一致，表明了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和国际共产主义运动团结进入新的发展阶段。”
    “火花报”说，各国共产党和工人党对莫斯科会议文件的讨论促进了思想工作的提高，推动了创造性的马克思列宁主义思想的发展，提高了共产党员在反对资产阶级思想及其影响的斗争中，在反对工人运动中的机会主义潮流的斗争中，在捍卫马克思列宁主义学说纯洁性的斗争中的战斗意志。实际情况表明，出席会议的共产党和工人党代表认为工人运动应该注意和警惕的主要危险是修正主义的这种看法是正确的。文章说，现代修正主义的论点集中地表现在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领中。只有国际反动势力才会欢迎这种论点。而各国共产党和工人党根本不同意这种论点。
    “火花报”最后说，莫斯科会议的文件是对国际共产主义运动在解决建设新的社会——社会主义社会问题上的有力支持，是对保卫和平的有力支持。没有任何力量能够阻挡人类向社会主义前进。各国共产党和工人党在无产阶级国际主义旗帜下不断加强兄弟的团结，它们领导着亿万人民争取世界和平和社会主义的胜利。
