    The First Revolution of the German Working Class and Its Lessons
    —Dedicated to the 40th Anniversary of the November Revolution of 1918
    Germany　Dr. H. Kolbe
    Under the influence of the great October Socialist Revolution and on the basis of the complete military collapse of the monarchical imperialist regime, a surging revolutionary situation emerged in Germany in the autumn of 1918. The working people were unwilling to live as before, and the ruling classes were no longer able to rule as before.

    The German monopoly bourgeoisie and Junker landowners attempted to curb the surging revolutionary movement by announcing constitutional reforms and preparing for armistice negotiations. In this situation of impending storm, the Social Democratic leaders were willing to serve to save the monarchy and the imperialist class rule. They provided two state secretaries, Scheidemann and Bauer, to the outgoing imperial government, with the aim of "winning over the masses" (Scheidemann's words).

    The Spartacus League gave a pointed assessment of the role of the opportunists as "doctors at the bedside of capitalism": "State socialism is now participating in the government, becoming the savior of capitalism and hindering the coming proletarian revolution."

    The Left was the only group in Germany that, spurred by the revolutionary crisis, formulated a revolutionary program. On October 7, 1918, the Spartacus League held a historic national conference in Berlin, in which representatives from the Bremen Left also participated.

    In its resolution on the world political situation, the national conference made the following statement on the revolutionary situation in Germany in the autumn of 1918: "The collapse of German imperialism has profoundly shaken the German constitution and the German economy, and created a revolutionary situation that has re-raised all the issues that the German bourgeoisie failed to resolve in the revolution of 1848." In addition, the conference passed an appeal to the people, calling on the working masses to fight for democratic rights and freedoms and to eliminate the material foundations of imperialism and militarism. The appeal included the following demands:

        Immediately release all political prisoners, immediately lift martial law, and confiscate all bank capital, mines, steel mills, and large estates.

    At the same time, it was emphasized that: "Proletarians, achieving these goals does not mean that your aims have been achieved; they are only a touchstone to test whether the democratization that the ruling classes and their agents flaunt to you is genuine. The struggle for genuine democratization is not aimed at parliament, suffrage, or ministers being members of parliament and other deceptions; it is aimed at the real foundation of all enemies of the people: the possession of land and capital, and the control of armed forces and the judiciary." This program of the national conference was the result of a profound analysis of the political situation at the time. It took into account Lenin's theory of the two stages of revolution. It pointed out the struggle to immediately end the imperialist war and overthrow the imperialist monarchy. This program demanded the removal of the material foundations of imperialism and militarism, and the resolute completion of the bourgeois democratic revolution, as a prerequisite for the transition to the socialist revolution. In this way, the Spartacus League and the Bremen Radical Left pointed out the goals and directions for the November Revolution. They pointed out the only correct way out that could bring about a just peace and bring democracy and a good life to the working people. The October Revolution in early November 1918 began with the mutiny of the sailors in Kiel against the government authorities' continued prosecution of the losing war. From there, the revolution spread throughout Germany. Workers and soldiers, under the leadership of the Spartacus League and following the example of the October Revolution, established committees as their fighting organs, eradicated the monarchy and the imperial government, and implemented a series of democratic rights and freedoms.

    Although the old regime machinery was severely shaken, the revolutionary forces of the working class were unable to cleanse the old state machinery and completely crush the power of the bourgeoisie and Junker landowners in the continuation of the revolution. The majority of the working class and workers' and soldiers' committees demanded socialism and approved of the means and methods to achieve socialism. Most people believed that they could gain power by relying on votes. The Social Democratic leaders took advantage of the working class and soldiers' lack of revolutionary experience and illusions about bourgeois parliamentarism, and mixed into the mass movement with pseudo-socialist rhetoric. Under the enticing slogan of "all socialists unite," they, together with the leaders of the German Independent Social Democratic Party, formed a new government in the name of the "Council of People's Deputies," which had a decisive influence on the workers' and soldiers' committees. The likes of Ebert and Haase, as confidants of the imperialists and militarists, ascended to the leadership of the bourgeois state in order to strangle the revolutionary movement and save the power status of the reactionary exploiting classes.

    The November Revolution clearly shows "how huge a misfortune and a huge danger" it is if the workers' movement is not led by a Marxist party, but opportunistic leaders exert the main influence on the masses.

    The Spartacus League and the Bremen Radical Left fought heroically, leading the revolutionary workers in any case. Only they called on the workers to rise up and fight to seize power from the imperialists and militarists. But their heroism could not replace the missing revolutionary fighting party.

    The German November Revolution showed that in the era of imperialism, without a Marxist-Leninist party, the main issue of the revolution, namely the issue of political power, cannot be resolved, and even the bourgeois democratic revolution cannot be carried through to the end. This fact was clearly demonstrated at the All-German Congress of Councils, which was held in Berlin from December 16 to 21, 1918. The congress passed the following resolution: "The All-German Congress of Workers' and Soldiers' Councils, representing national power, transfers legislative and executive power to the Council of People's Deputies until the National Assembly makes another decision."

    This resolution of the All-German Congress of Councils made a decision on the issue of political power that was favorable to the forces of imperialism and militarism. It did not help to solve the basic task of the November Revolution, which was to smash the foundations of German imperialism, thereby creating conditions for democracy and socialism.

    The counter-revolution immediately began to openly attack after the All-German Congress of Councils, in order to militarily defeat the revolutionary forces before the National Assembly elections. In early January 1919, the counter-revolution defeated the revolutionary vanguard of the proletariat after bloody battles, and under the protection of heavily armed Freikorps, cobbled together a bourgeois majority in the parliamentary elections on January 19.

    The German working class's revolutionary struggle to seize power from the imperialists and militarists was thus defeated. The German November Revolution did not go beyond the scope of the bourgeois democratic revolution. In nature, the November Revolution was a bourgeois democratic revolution carried out to some extent by proletarian means and methods. Despite its failure, the November Revolution wrote a glorious chapter in the history of the German working class's revolutionary struggle. It was the largest revolutionary mass movement since the German Peasants' War, and the first revolution of the German working class against imperialism and militarism.

    The Communist Party of Germany was born in the flames of the November Revolution, which was a major result of the mass revolutionary struggle. The founders of this party were leaders who were tested and loyal to the working class, such as Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Franz Mehring, Clara Zetkin, Leo Jogiches, and Wilhelm Pieck. Due to the establishment of the Communist Party of Germany, the German working class obtained the revolutionary fighting organization needed to victoriously carry out the struggle to seize power. The Communist Party of Germany developed into a Marxist-Leninist mass party during the years of the Weimar Republic. It tirelessly struggled in the homeland of scientific socialism to restore the unity of the German working class. It constituted the decisive condition for the establishment of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the working class has been able to fully realize the will of the revolutionary fighters of the November Revolution in the German Democratic Republic, and finally destroy the political and economic foundations of imperialism and militarism.

    德国工人阶级的第一次革命及其教训
    ——为一九一八年十一月革命四十周年而作
    德国　赫·科尔贝博士
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命的影响之下，在君主政体帝国主义政权军事上完全崩溃的基础上，1918年秋季德国出现了高涨的革命形势。劳动人民不愿再照老样子生活下去，统治阶级已无法再照老样子统治下去。
    德国垄断资产阶级和容克地主，企图用宣布宪法改革和准备停战谈判的办法来遏制汹涌澎湃的革命运动。在这种山雨欲来风满楼的形势下，社会民主党领袖甘愿为拯救君主政体和帝国主义阶级统治效劳，他们向末届帝国政府提供了两个国务秘书谢德曼和鲍爱尔，目的是“争取群众”（谢德曼语）。
    斯巴达克联盟对机会主义者所起的“资本主义病床旁边的医生”的作用，给了一针见血的评价：“国家社会主义现在参加政府，成为资本主义的救星而阻碍正在到来的无产阶级革命。”
    左派是德国唯一在革命危机的促使下制订革命纲领的人。1918年10月7日，斯巴达克联盟在柏林举行了具有历史意义的全国代表会议，不来梅左派（注）也派代表参加了这次会议。
    全国代表会议在关于世界政治局势的决议中，就1918年秋德国革命形势发表声明如下：“德国帝国主义的崩溃深深地震动了德国宪法和德国经济，并制造了一种革命形势，重新提出了德国资产阶级在1848年革命中未能解决的所有问题。”此外，会议还通过了一个告人民书，号召劳动群众为民主权利和自由以及为消灭帝国主义和军国主义的物质基础而斗争。告人民书包括这样一些要求：
        立即释放一切政治犯，立即取消戒严，没收全部银行资本、矿山、冶炼厂和大农庄。
    同时还强调指出：“无产者，达到这些目的并不意味你们的目的已经达到，它们只是一块试金石，可以考验统治阶级及其代理人向你们炫耀的民主化是否是真正的。争取真正民主化的斗争目的，不在于议会、选举权或议员当部长和其他欺骗行为；它针对一切人民公敌的现实基础：对土地和资本的占有，对武装力量和司法的控制。”全国代表会议的这个纲领是对当时政治局势的深刻分析的结果。它考虑到列宁关于革命的两个阶段的学说。它指出争取立即结束帝国主义战争的斗争和推翻帝国主义君主统治。这个纲领要求清除帝国主义和军国主义的物质基础，把资产阶级民主革命坚决进行到底，当作过渡到社会主义革命的先决条件。这样，斯巴达克联盟和不来梅激进左派就给十一月革命指出了目标和方向。他们指出了能促成公正和平并给劳动人民带来民主和美好生活的唯一正确出路。1918年11月初的十月革命是以基尔的水兵为反对政府当局继续进行吃败仗的战争而举行的起义开始的。革命从这儿扩展到整个德国。工人和士兵在斯巴达克联盟的领导下，以十月革命为榜样，成立了委员会作为他们的战斗机关，铲除了君主政体及帝制政府，实行了一系列民主权利和自由。
    虽然旧的政权机器严重动摇了，但是要清洗旧的国家机器和在革命的继续过程中完全粉碎资产阶级和容克地主的势力，工人阶级的革命力量还做不到。工人阶级和工人士兵委员会多数是要求社会主义的，并赞成实现社会主义的手段和方法。多数人相信能够依靠选票来取得政权。社会民主党领袖们利用了工人和士兵群众革命经验不足和对资产阶级议会存在幻想，用冒牌社会主义的言论混入了群众运动。他们在“一切社会主义者团结起来”这一笼络人心的口号下，同德国独立社会民主党领袖们一起，在“人民全权代表委员会”名义下组成了新政府，它对工人士兵委员会起了决定性的影响。艾伯特和哈赛之流，作为帝国主义者和军国主义者的心腹，登上了资产阶级国家的领导地位，以便扼杀革命运动，拯救反动剥削阶级的势力地位。
    十一月革命十分清楚地说明，如果没有一个马克思主义政党领导工人运动，而是机会主义领袖对群众发生主要影响，这是“多么巨大的不幸和巨大的危险”。
    斯巴达克联盟和不来梅左派激进分子进行了英勇的斗争，在任何情况下都领导着革命工人。只有他们号召工人起来斗争，争取剥夺帝国主义者和军国主义者的权力。但是他们的英雄气概并不能代替所缺少的革命的战斗政党。
    德国十一月革命表明：在帝国主义时期，如果没有一个马克思列宁主义的政党，革命的主要问题即政权问题是不可能解决的，就连资产阶级民主革命也不可能坚持进行到底。这个事实在全德委员会代表大会上表现得十分明显。这次大会是1918年12月16日至21日在柏林举行的。大会作出了下列决议：“代表全国政权的德国工人士兵委员会全国代表大会，在国民议会另作决定以前把立法权和执行权移交人民全权代表委员会。”
    全德委员会代表大会的这项决议，对政权问题作出了有利于帝国主义和军国主义势力的决定。它无助于解决十一月革命的基本任务，这个基本任务在于粉碎德国帝国主义的基础，从而为民主和社会主义创造条件。
    反革命在全德委员会代表大会结束后立即开始公开进攻，以便在国民议会选举之前从军事上打垮革命力量。1919年1月初，反革命经过流血战斗打败了无产阶级的革命先锋队，并在配备重型武装的义勇军的护卫下，在1月19日的议会选举中凑成了资产阶级多数。
    德国工人阶级争取剥夺帝国主义和军国主义权力的革命斗争从而遭到了失败。德国十一月革命并没有超越资产阶级民主革命的范围。按其性质来说，十一月革命是在某种程度上以无产阶级的手段和方法来进行的资产阶级民主革命。尽管遭到了失败，十一月革命在德国工人阶级革命斗争史上写下了光荣的一章。它是那时继德国农民战争之后的最大的革命群众运动，是德国工人阶级反对帝国主义和军国主义的第一次革命。
    德国共产党在十一月革命的火焰中诞生了，这是群众革命斗争的重大结果。这个政党的创始人是像卡尔·李卜克内西、罗莎·卢森堡、弗朗茨·梅林、克拉拉·蔡特金、列奥·约吉歇斯和威廉·皮克这样久经考验和忠于工人阶级的领袖。由于德国共产党的成立，德国工人阶级获得了为胜利地进行夺取政权的斗争所需要的革命战斗组织。德国共产党在魏玛共和国的年代里发展成为马克思列宁主义的群众政党。它在科学社会主义的祖国为恢复德国工人阶级的统一而孜孜不倦地进行斗争。它构成了德国统一社会党成立的决定性条件。在德国统一社会党的领导下，工人阶级已经能够在德意志民主共和国完全实现了十一月革命的革命战士的遗嘱，终于摧毁了帝国主义和军国主义的政治和经济基础。
