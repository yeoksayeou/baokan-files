    The "Worker-Peasant-Soldier Painting Exhibition," jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Culture and the Chinese Artists Association, is scheduled to open in Beijing today. All exhibits are displayed simultaneously at the Shuai Fu Yuan Art Exhibition Hall and the Hua Fang Zhai in Beihai Park. Workers, peasants, and soldiers have created brilliant miracles in labor and combat, and have also demonstrated outstanding wisdom in the cultural revolution. Since the Great Leap Forward this year, a mass art creation movement has been launched in factories, rural areas, and troops across the country. During the movement, many vivid examples of workers painting workers, peasants painting peasants, and soldiers painting soldiers have emerged, and countless excellent works have been produced. The more than 800 works exhibited this time are carefully selected from more than 2,000 pieces collected from various places. They include various forms such as traditional Chinese painting, murals, oil paintings, comic strips, cartoons, propaganda paintings, sculptures, and paper-cuts, and are rich and colorful. These works vividly reflect the encouraging and inspiring scenes of our country's Great Leap Forward in all aspects, and have become a powerful tool to cooperate with the propaganda of various movements and promote production and combat.

    本报讯　由文化部和中国美术家协会联合主办的“工农兵画展”定今日在京开幕。全部展品分在帅府园美术展览馆和北海公园画舫斋同时展出。工农兵在劳动和战斗中创造辉煌的奇迹，在文化革命中也显示了出众的智慧。今年大跃进以来，全国广大的工厂、农村和部队都掀起了群众性的美术创作运动，在运动中涌现出了许多工画工、农画农、兵画兵的生动事例，产生了无数优秀的作品。这次展出的八百多件作品，就是从各地搜集来的二千多件中精选出来的。包括有国画、壁画、油画、连环画、漫画、宣传画、雕塑和剪纸等各种形式，丰富多彩。这些作品极其生动地反映了我国在大跃进中各方面振奋人心、令人鼓舞的图景，成为配合宣传各项运动、推动生产和战斗的有力工具。
