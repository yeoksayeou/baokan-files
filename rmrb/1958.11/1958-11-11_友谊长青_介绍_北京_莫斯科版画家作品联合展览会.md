Everlasting Friendship
——Introducing the "Beijing-Moscow Joint Exhibition of Printmakers' Works"
    Lǐ Huá

    Last year, during the grand celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution, we held a "Chinese Modern Prints Exhibition" in Moscow. To consolidate this profound and pure friendship, in a meeting, Chinese and Soviet printmakers decided to hold joint exhibitions of works by printmakers from the two capitals in Moscow and Beijing respectively on the national days of the two countries in 1958. One year later, the "Beijing-Moscow Joint Exhibition of Printmakers' Works" has indeed become a gift for the national days of the two countries, appearing in Moscow on October 1st, and opening today in Beijing on the forty-first anniversary of the October Revolution.

    It is the first time that the works of artists from the two countries are jointly exhibited; however, Soviet prints, with their excellent tradition and high achievements, have long been a model for our country's printmakers to learn from, thanks to Mr. Lu Xun's introduction twenty-eight years ago. The friendship between Chinese and Soviet printmakers has been intimate and seamless over the long years.

    The works of Soviet printmakers exhibited this time include the carefully crafted masterpieces of renowned older generation printmakers such as Favorsky, as well as the talented younger generation printmakers who have just graduated from art academies. The themes broadly include the following aspects: the great revolutionary history; the friendship of all ethnic groups; the enthusiastic labor of young people in reclamation areas; the socialist labor competition in factory workshops; portraits of modern people; the daily life of the Soviet people; the beautiful architecture of ancient Russia and the achievements of socialist construction; poetic Russian landscapes and flowers; and illustrations of ancient and modern literary works. The forms are even more colorful and splendid: there are exquisitely detailed "wood engraving" with hairlike lines; bold and simple linoleum prints; colorful and unrestrained lithographs; and densely carved copperplate prints with rich tones. As for the styles, they are even more distinct and rich: there are woodcuts that maintain the old traditions of Russian art, calm and simple, full of strength, represented by the older generation woodcut artist Favorsky. The exhibit "Propaganda Poster for the Stockholm World Peace Council" is representative of his work. There are genre paintings that are colorful and calm, depicting daily life and approachable, such as Gelman's "Successor," Gening's "On the Highway Near Moscow," and Rodel's "On the Threshing Floor." There are historical paintings full of revolutionary thought, passionate and solemn, such as Ivanov's "Chapayev," Rodel's "The First Cavalry," and D.D. Pavlovich's "Ready to Go." There are travel sketches full of poetry and lively and fresh techniques, such as Ponomarev's "Vietnamese Girl," Kokorin's "Indian Suite," and Beresky's "Helsinki Fish Market." There are flower paintings with bright and simple colors, such as Alimova's "Wild Cherry" and Arenstadt's "Butterfly Flower." There are lyrical paintings that create a fairytale world in the Russian style with innocent emotions and flexible brushstrokes, such as Ukhanova's "Swan Myth." There are illustrations with exquisite knife skills that carve out decorative small wood engravings, such as Lina Kravchenko's "The Immortal Wang Xiaohé" and Goncharov's illustrations of many classical literary works.

    In these diverse styles, we see a common standard of effort, that is: Soviet printmakers adhere to the socialist realism creation path, making their works full of advanced ideas, profoundly and widely expressing all aspects of the life and thoughts and feelings of the Soviet people; pursuing beautiful forms that match the content; and demanding further improvement in the generalization of works, more precise and delicate depiction of characters and all images, and strengthening efforts to enrich the works with abundant emotions to greatly improve the artistry of the works. On the other hand, the Soviet printmakers' deep friendship towards us is also expressed in their creation of portraits of Chinese figures, such as Vera Fedayevskaya's "Portrait of Lu Xun," Zhukov's "Portrait of Painter Jiang Zhaohe," and Brelenin's "Portrait of Writer Lao She," which fully demonstrates how extensive and profound the friendship between our two countries' literary and art workers is.

    The works of Chinese printmakers also have their own characteristics, showing new achievements in both content and form. Through our works, we can see the new face of China in building socialism, and we can see the enthusiasm of the Chinese working people for selfless labor in building communism, although compared with the reality of the great leap forward in all aspects, the expression is still far from enough! No matter how different the printmaking arts of China and the Soviet Union are from a traditional point of view, the thoughts and feelings contained in each work are so consistent! This fact powerfully illustrates that the brotherly countries united in China and the Soviet Union, their art follows the leading ideology of Marxism-Leninism, has a common goal, and walks on a common road. We eagerly expect the printmaking art of China and the Soviet Union to develop even more, and the friendship between the printmakers of the two countries to last forever!

    友谊长青
    ——介绍“北京——莫斯科版画家作品联合展览会”
    李桦
    去年隆重地庆祝十月革命四十周年的时候，我们在莫斯科举办了一个“中国现代版画展览会”。为了巩固这种深厚纯真的友谊，在一次会晤中，中苏版画家们决定了在1958年两国的国庆日，在莫斯科和北京分别举行两国首都版画家作品的联合展览会。事隔一年，“北京——莫斯科版画家作品联合展览会”果然成为两国国庆日的献礼，在10月1日出现于莫斯科，而在今天十月革命四十一周年在北京开幕了。
    两国艺术家的作品联合举行展览会，这还是第一次；但是，苏联版画具有优良的传统和高度的成就，在二十八年前由于鲁迅先生的介绍早就成为我国版画家学习的榜样，中苏版画家的友谊在悠久的岁月里已经是亲密无间的了。
    这次展出的苏联版画家们的作品，包括着享有盛名的老一辈的版画家如法沃尔斯基等，以至刚从美术学院毕业的有才能的年青一代的版画家们的精心杰构。题材则广泛地包括着下列各个方面：伟大的革命历史；各族人民的友谊；垦荒地区青年们的热情劳动；工厂车间的社会主义劳动竞赛；现代人的肖像；苏联人民的日常生活；古代俄罗斯的优美建筑和社会主义建筑的成就；富有诗意的俄罗斯风景和花卉；以及古代和现代文艺作品的插图。形式更是多彩而灿烂：有精巧细致刻线如发的“木口木刻”；有豪放质朴的麻胶版画；有色彩富丽，潇洒脱俗的石版画；有绵密刻划，色调丰润的铜版画。至于风格方面则更为鲜明而丰富了：有保持俄罗斯艺术老传统，沉着朴素，充满力量以老一辈的木刻家法沃尔斯基为代表的木刻。这次展出品“斯德哥尔摩世界和平理事会宣传画”是其代表。有色彩富丽而沉着，描写日常生活，平易近人如格尔曼的“接班”，格宁的“在莫斯科近郊的大道上”，罗捷尔的“在打谷场上”的风俗画。有充满革命思想，热情而严肃如伊万诺夫的“夏伯阳”，罗捷尔的“第一骑兵队”，德·德·巴夫洛维奇的“整装待发”的历史画。有富有诗意、手法活泼清新如波诺马列夫的“越南姑娘”，科科林的“印度之行组画”，别列斯基的“赫尔辛基的鱼市”等旅行写生版画。有阿利莫娃的“野生樱桃”，阿仁什特达特的“蝴蝶花”那种色彩鲜艳而单纯的花卉画。有以天真的情感，灵活的笔调创造出俄罗斯风格的童话世界如乌汉诺娃的“天鹅神话”等的抒情画。有以精致的刀法刻出富于装饰性的小幅木口木刻如丽娜·克拉甫钦珂的“不死的王孝和”和冈察洛夫的许多古典文艺作品等的插图画。
    我们在这些多彩的风格中，看到一个共通的努力标准，那就是：苏联的版画家们坚持着社会主义现实主义的创作道路，使作品充满了先进的思想，深刻而广泛地表现了苏联人民各方面的生活和思想感情；追求着吻合内容的美好的形式；而且要求在进一步提高作品的概括力，更精确而细腻地刻画人物和一切形象，以充沛的感情来充实作品等方面加强努力，使作品的艺术性大大的提高。另一方面，苏联版画家们对于我们深厚的友谊也表现于以我国人物从事肖像画的创作这一点上，如维拉·费佳耶夫斯卡雅的“鲁迅像”，茹可夫的“画家蒋兆和像”，勃列纳仁的“作家老舍像”等，这更充分表明我们两国的文学艺术家的友谊是如何广泛而深长的了。
    中国版画家们的作品也具有特色，不论在内容上以至形式上都表现出有新的成就。通过我们的作品可以看出中国目前在建设社会主义中的新面貌，可以看出中国劳动人民为建设共产主义而进行忘我劳动的热情，虽然与各方面大跃进的现实情况比，还嫌表现得很不够！中苏两国的版画艺术从传统方面说来不论是怎样的不同，而每件作品所含蓄着的思想和感情却是多么的一致啊！这事实是紧密有力地说明了中苏两国团结着的兄弟国家，它们的艺术遵循着马克思列宁主义的主导思想，有着共同的奋斗目标，走着共同的大道。我们以热烈心情预期中苏两国的版画艺术更加发展，两国版画家们的友谊长青不老！
