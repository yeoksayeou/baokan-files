Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, November 14th. Hong Kong’s "Ta Kung Pao" published an article today analyzing the development of contradictions between the Chiang Kai-shek group and the United States in recent times. The article believes that the development of US-Chiang contradictions from September 30th to the present can be divided into three stages. The overall characteristic of these three stages is that the Dulles clique has openly promoted the "Two Chinas" plot and exposed the fact that the United States will eventually abandon the Taiwan authorities one day.

The article stated that the first stage of US-Chiang contradictions was from Dulles openly scolding Chiang Kai-shek as "stupid" until before Dulles' visit to Taipei. Dulles, in front of reporters from various countries, scolded Chiang Kai-shek for stationing heavy troops in Kinmen as "stupid," and said that he "should not dream of returning to the mainland with his own military force." In response, Taipei newspapers reflected the Taiwan authorities' dissatisfaction, angrily scolding Dulles for betraying trust and righteousness. Huang Shao-gu, the "Foreign Minister" of the Chiang Kai-shek group, also accused Dulles of being a "selfish" and "cowardly" "international politician," saying that such a person was both "pathetic" and "weak." It can be described as tit-for-tat. Thus, US-Chiang relations experienced an unprecedentedly bad situation.

The article believes that the second stage of US-Chiang contradictions was from the Chiang-Dulles talks until Dulles's return to the United States to report. Chiang Kai-shek and Dulles's three days of talks were filled with serious differences, and ended with a joint communiqué that paid lip service to unity but could not hide the divisions. Although Dulles gained some advantages in the communiqué, he was far from getting his wish. Dulles's blatant promotion of the "Two Chinas" approach caused great vigilance on the Taiwan side. Taiwan and Hong Kong's pro-Chiang newspapers all expressed "heavy hearts," and some newspapers even suggested that precautions should be taken against the United States kicking away its "ally" and sacrificing the Taiwan authorities one day after bullying them. Therefore, they demanded that the Chiang Kai-shek group not be "controlled by others" but should "seek its own way out."

The article said that the third stage of US-Chiang contradictions was from Ye Gongchao's statement that they "did not abandon the use of force" until the present. On October 28th, Ye Gongchao, the Chiang Kai-shek group's "ambassador" to the United States, stated when leaving Taipei to go to the United States that the Chiang Kai-shek group had not promised to completely abandon the use of force. White, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, immediately refuted it. Later, Chen Cheng, the "Vice President" of the Chiang Kai-shek group, and Robertson, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, also joined the battle. Robertson and others insisted that if the Chiang Kai-shek group wanted to use force, it must first obtain U.S. consent. Chen Cheng insisted that it was not necessary to obtain U.S. consent, and even yesterday deliberately clamored for "counterattacking the mainland" in order to engage in a war of words with the U.S. This issue is still being debated today.

The article stated that the surfacing of US-Chiang contradictions has increased the Chiang Kai-shek group's understanding that the United States cannot be relied upon. They have realized that the Americans have many tricks, from isolating Taiwan to trusteeship of Taiwan.

### 由埋怨而猜疑而争吵  美蒋矛盾步步发展  香港“大公报”发表文章加以分析

    由埋怨而猜疑而争吵
    美蒋矛盾步步发展
    香港“大公报”发表文章加以分析
    新华社香港14日电　香港“大公报”今天发表了一篇文章，分析蒋介石集团和美国之间最近时期矛盾的发展情况。文章认为，从9月30日到现在，美蒋矛盾的发展可分为三个阶段。而三个阶段总的特点，就是杜勒斯之流已经公开推行“两个中国”的阴谋，并且暴露了美国有朝一日终要把台湾当局抛弃。
    文章说，美蒋矛盾的第一阶段是从杜勒斯公开骂蒋介石“愚蠢”直到杜勒斯到台北活动前。杜勒斯当着各国记者的面，大骂蒋介石在金门驻扎重兵为“愚蠢”，而且说他“休想凭自己的武力回到大陆”。为此，台北的报纸反映了台湾当局的不满，痛骂杜勒斯背弃信义。蒋介石集团“外交部长”黄少谷，也指责杜勒斯为“自私自利”的“国际政客”，说这种人既“可悲”又“懦弱”。可谓针锋相对。这样，美蒋关系出现了前所未有的恶劣局面。
    文章认为，美蒋矛盾的第二阶段是从蒋杜会谈直到杜勒斯返美报告的时期。蒋介石和杜勒斯三天的会谈充满了严重歧见，而以一纸空谈团结但掩饰不了分歧的会谈公报而告终。杜勒斯在公报上虽然占了一些便宜，却远没有如愿以偿。杜勒斯公然推行“两个中国”的做法，在台湾方面引起了很大的戒心。台湾和香港各亲蒋报纸，莫不表示“心情沉重”，有些报纸还进而提出，要慎防美国在欺压之后，有朝一日会一脚踢开“盟友”，牺牲台湾当局。因此要求蒋介石集团不要“受制于人”，而应“自寻出路”。
    文章说，美蒋矛盾的第三阶段从叶公超声明“并非放弃使用武力”直到目前。10月28日，蒋介石集团驻美国“大使”叶公超在离开台北去美国的时候，声称蒋介石集团并没有承诺完全放弃武力。美国国务院发言人怀特立刻加以驳斥。后来，蒋介石集团“副总统”陈诚和美国助理国务卿罗伯逊等也加入了战团。罗伯逊等坚持，蒋介石集团如想用武，必须先得美国同意。陈诚则坚持不一定要得到美国同意，直到昨天还故意叫嚷“反攻大陆”，以便与美方舌战。这个问题直到目前仍在各执一词。
  文章说，美蒋矛盾的表面化使蒋介石集团增加了一点认识：美国是靠不住的。他们已经体会到，美国人从孤立台湾到托管台湾，花样还多着呢。
