    Education Combined with Labor, a Myriad of Flowers in Full Bloom
    ——On the "Exhibition of the Combination of Education and Productive Labor"
    Jilin: Fruitful Achievements in Work-Study Programs
    Beneath a giant, beautiful painting of Changbai Mountain, are displayed over seventy types of medicinal herbs and Jilin specialties – mountain grapes and other mountain fruits – cultivated and collected by the young masters of the mountainous regions, the Young Pioneers of elementary schools. Even the cultivation of ginseng, known as one of the three treasures of Northeast China, has been mastered by the young horticulturalists. On display are nine ginseng roots weighing over one and a half taels each, a rarity for ginseng.
    Here are exhibited the fruitful results of middle school students' work-study programs. On the glittering steel marshal stand, there are fifteen grades of carbon steel, aluminum-iron alloy steel, and over a hundred kinds of iron parts, as well as nine types of machinery and fifteen types of machine parts. In the electrical section, twenty-one exhibits are displayed, including an electronic thermometer made by middle school students, and a six-lamp, six-use telephone conference machine and wireless transceiver made by the young inventors of the Jilin Normal University Affiliated Middle School. Science is no longer mysterious to middle school students. With only an ordinary level of cultural knowledge, middle school students have produced germanium intermediate – germanium dioxide. Displayed alongside these exhibits are thirty-three kinds of chemical industrial products, such as elm bark gelatin, which used to be imported, and twenty kinds of pesticides, such as wolfsbane insecticide. As for universities, there is an endless array of extraordinary achievements. In just a few months, Jilin University alone produced 153 products as gifts for the "July 1st" and "October 1st" celebrations, including nine world firsts, ten reaching or surpassing international standards, and sixty-six new products in China. In the field of semiconductor research, the exhibits include semiconductor triodes, solar cells, phototubes, and other components and equipment, as well as over ten exhibits such as semiconductor radios and thermometers.
    Ningxia: All Universities and Schools Implement Work-Study Programs
    Entering the Ningxia pavilion, people can see the new changes in the educational landscape of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region during the Great Leap Forward. All secondary schools and universities in the region have implemented work-study programs. Many schools' teachers and students are producing outstanding products in their own factories and farms.
    The universal tractor manufactured by the Yinchuan Agricultural Mechanization School can not only drive a double-share plow to cultivate land but also carry goods with a trailer. The "Central Nervous System Conduction Electrical Display Pathway Model" made by teachers and students of the Yinchuan Health School can demonstrate the transmission of the human nervous system to the audience. Artificial cotton made by Wuzhong Normal School and Helan Middle School, Wuzhong Girls' Middle School, and other schools has already been put into production. Wuzhong Girls' Middle School has also established a textile factory with an annual output of three thousand bolts of white cloth. The exhibition features their high-quality "Work-Study Brand" white cloth.
    Among the many agricultural products displayed in the exhibition hall, we can see the fifty-plus-pound giant pumpkin cultivated by the Wuzhong Middle School farm, and the six-and-a-half-pound giant eggplant bred by the Young Pioneers of Yongning Yanghe Elementary School after hybridizing the pollen of pumpkins and water chestnuts with the pollen of eggplants!
    Sichuan: Science Comes from Practice
    An ordinary earthenware sputum container and a small bottle of semiconductor silicon are displayed side by side in the Sichuan Pavilion. It is hard to imagine that this bottle of precious silicon was extracted from stones using an electric arc furnace made from this earthenware sputum container. The creators of this miracle are several third-year students from the Department of Metallurgy at Chongqing University. Lacking the necessary data and materials, they relied on collective research, using foamed sandstone and clay to make earthen refractory mud, and using salt water instead of resistors. In a very short time, they turned a broken sputum container into an earthen electric arc furnace and extracted silicon from the stones. The teachers of this department, although having many years of teaching experience, lacked practical operational knowledge. Now, they have refined a total of 124 types of alloy steel and carbon steel, built a new small-scale iron and steel joint enterprise with an annual output of 50,000 tons, and designed blueprints for blast furnaces ranging from three cubic meters to one hundred cubic meters, which have been supplied to hundreds of units.
    In the Sichuan Pavilion, a total of 280 sets and 1,600 pieces of exhibits are displayed. Here are displayed over 200 kinds of wild fibers made by teachers and students from wild tree bark, vines, and grass. There is a bed of cotton wool made from rice straw fiber, as white and soft as real cotton wool, making it difficult to distinguish. There are over 140 kinds of liquid and powdered pesticides, shimmering with various colors, which are effective in preventing and controlling rice blast, rice stem borers, cotton pests, and other crop diseases and insect pests. These are all made by teachers and students of Southwest Agricultural College, Sichuan Agricultural College, Jianyang Fourth Junior High School, and other schools, who learned from farmers' experiences and collected various wild plants and medicinal herbs from fields and forests with the spirit of Shennong tasting hundreds of herbs. The production methods are simple, and the costs are also low.
    Shanxi: Planting Experimental Fields and Running Factories
    All levels of schools in Shanxi are carrying out work-study programs, both planting experimental fields and running factories. The Shanxi Pavilion displays exhibits from the tens of thousands of teachers and students in the province engaged in the great battle of steel production. The 251 middle schools in the Changzhi region alone produce about 40,000 tons of iron per day, and Yangcheng County No. 2 Middle School launched a satellite with a daily steel output of 115 tons. Now, every class in universities and middle schools and every school in elementary schools in the province has a factory, producing all kinds of products. A large number of teachers and students from universities and middle schools in the province have also gone to the countryside, factories, and mountains. According to statistics up to the end of August, 1.42 million people in the province have participated in industrial and agricultural production and public welfare labor. Teachers and students from the Taiyuan Water Conservancy School spent five months in the countryside, traveling to 84 counties, and formulated treatment plans for 36 river systems and river basins for 1,651 townships, measuring 120,000 canals, with an irrigation area of 35.56 million mu.
    Scientific research in various schools is also very active. Over 400 teachers and students from Taiyuan Institute of Technology completed over 70 of the 202 projects in ten days of hard work, including electronic analog computers, ball rolling machines, plastic oil felts, and precision lathes. The Shanxi Medical College completed 825 technical innovations in August and September.
    Here are also displayed the achievements of the "Eighteen Young Innovators and Creators." One group is the Young Pioneers, led by Shang Machao, from Xiangtou Elementary School in Jieyu County. They used grafting to cultivate several kinds of "two-story" plants. The "upstairs" (stem) of one plant is a tomato, while the "downstairs" (root) grows potatoes. The "upstairs" of another plant is a sunflower, while the "downstairs" is a Jerusalem artichoke. They also grafted sunflowers and cotton, hoping to harvest black cotton; they hybridized the pollen of more than a dozen plants with cotton, hoping to cultivate red, yellow, and other colored cotton.
    Liaoning: Everywhere is Steel and Machinery
    Liaoning is the heart of China's heavy industry. Entering the Liaoning Pavilion immediately gives a prominent impression: everywhere is steel and machinery.
    The more than 5,000 factories run by universities and middle schools across the province have emitted brilliant light in supporting the country's industrial construction. Look, the small coal-fired steelmaking open-hearth furnace at the Northeast Institute of Technology is a pioneering innovation in world steelmaking technology. This type of small open-hearth furnace can be widely promoted in counties and townships. Dalian No. 6 Middle School used oil drums to refine high-quality steel, and Kaiyuan Korean Middle School used earthen blast furnaces to refine a large amount of iron, all illustrating that the steel industry has blossomed in schools throughout Liaoning Province.
    The mechanical industry has also shone brightly in schools. The world's first steam engine bridge control, manufactured by Dalian Maritime College, is one of the many cutting-edge products in the exhibition. With the application of bridge control, the driver can directly operate the ship's engine on the bridge, which will greatly improve the maneuverability and accuracy of operation and management, reduce the heavy physical labor of the marine engineers, reduce the number of marine engineering management personnel, and eliminate the marine casualties that should not have occurred in the past.
    Universities and middle schools in Liaoning Province have also achieved many successes in electricity, chemicals, and medicine through work-study programs. Under the slogan of "where there is a need for electricity, there is electricity," universities and middle schools have established power plants in a big way. A large chart tells the audience that in less than two months, 13 ordinary middle schools in Shenyang City alone have established power plants, with a power generation capacity of more than 160,000 kilowatts. The "gold steel sand" necessary for mechanical processing, researched and trial-produced by teachers and students of Shenyang First Chemical School, has reached a quality of 5000 grit, exceeding the 3500 grit German product. The "mobile X-ray diagnostic machine," researched and trial-produced by teachers and students of Shenyang Medical College, has reached the international level. There is no need for a darkroom for fluoroscopy and photography. It is small in size and can be moved at will, making it easy to promote in towns and villages. Among the more than 100 topics completed by teachers and students of Shenyang Pharmaceutical College in combination with production labor, 33 have reached the international or domestic advanced level. Among them, the "gelatin sponge," a must-have for surgical hemostasis, has a water absorption capacity of 1:68, exceeding the United States' 1:50, and even more exceeding the United Kingdom's 1:30.
    Heilongjiang: The First Province Without Illiteracy
    Heilongjiang is the first province in the country without illiteracy. At present, the province has popularized preschool education, elementary education, and junior high school education. Secondary vocational schools and colleges and universities are also spread throughout the province, and it has been proposed to popularize secondary education to all people within five years and higher education to all people within ten years.
    The Party's policy of combining education with productive labor has already shone brightly in Heilongjiang. At present, every department and subject in middle schools, elementary schools, and universities in the province has established factories and farms. Schools in various places are engaged in steel, machinery, and food production, and have already produced a large number of new products. Among the 1,322 new products produced by Harbin Institute of Technology, 480 have reached the international and domestic advanced level. Among them is China's first dynamic model of the power system, marking that China's research work on the power system has entered the forefront of world science. The school has also made five electronic analog computers, one of which is a universal combination electronic analog computer, which can be used for various simulation tests for the design of missiles, boilers, turbines, and water turbines. The high-efficiency insecticide E605, manufactured by Northeast Agricultural College, has special effects on crop pests. Many middle schools in Heilongjiang have also produced products that climb to the peak of science. The metal-ceramic knife manufactured by Harbin No. 6 Middle School has surpassed the technical level of the United States. The semiconductor element germanium made by Harbin No. 16 Middle School, the electronic timer made by Mudanjiang Korean Middle School, and the four-use wireless motor for radio reception, broadcasting, calling, and conferences created by Hailun No. 1 Middle School are also of good quality.

    教育结合劳动  百花万紫千红
    ——在“教育与生产劳动相结合展览会”上
    吉林：勤工俭学硕果累累
    在巨幅美丽长白山的画图下，陈列着山区小主人、小学红领巾们培植、采集的七十余种药材和吉林特产——山葡萄等山果。号称东北三宝之一——人参的培植，也被小园艺家所掌握，这里展出了重量达一两半的人参九只，是人参中所罕见的。
    这里展出了中学生勤工俭学的硕果。金光闪闪的钢铁元帅台上，有十五号碳钢、铝铁合金钢和百余种铁制零件，还有九种机械和十五种机械零件。在电气部分展出了中学生制的电子温度计等二十一种展品，有吉林师大附中小发明家制造的六灯六用电话会议机、无线收发讯机等。在中学生面前，科学也不神秘了，仅有普通文化水平的中学生，制成了锗的中间体——二氧化锗，和这种展品陈列在一起的还有过去靠进口的榆皮烤胶等三十三种化学工业产品，以及狼毒杀虫剂等二十种农药。至于大学，更是奇花异果，看不胜看，在短短的几个月里仅吉林大学在“七一”“十一”两次献礼的产品就有一百五十三项，其中有世界首创九项，达到和超过国际水平十项，属于国内新产品六十六项。在半导体的研究的成果中，展品有半导体三级管、光电池、光电管等元件和器材，以及半导体收音机、温度计等十余项展品。
    宁夏：大中学校全部实行勤工俭学
    走进宁夏馆，人们可以看到大跃进中宁夏回族自治区教育面貌的新变化。全区所有的中等学校和高等学校都实行了勤工俭学，不少学校的师生都在自己举办的工厂和农场中，生产出出色的产品来。
    银川农业机械化学校制造的万能拖拉机，不但可以带动双铧犁耕地，还可以带拖斗载运货物。银川卫生学校师生制造的“中枢神经传导电示通路模型”，可以给观众表演人的神经系统传导的情况。吴忠师范和贺兰中学、吴忠女中等校制成的人造棉已经投入生产。吴忠女中还建立了一个年产三千匹白布的纺织厂，展览会上陈列着她们生产的质量很好的“勤工牌”白布。
    展览馆里陈列的许多农产品中，我们可以看到吴忠中学农场培植的五十多斤重的大南瓜，和永宁养和完全小学少先队员将南瓜和茭瓜的花粉与茄子的花粉杂交后，培育出的六斤半重的大茄子！
    四川：科学来自实践
    一个普通的土磁痰盂和一小瓶半导体硅，并排陈列在四川馆里。人们很难想像，这瓶珍贵的硅，竟是用这土磁痰盂制成的电弧炉从石头中提炼出来的。创造这个奇迹的是重庆大学冶金系三年级的几个学生。他们没有必要的资料和材料，但是靠着集体的钻研，用泡砂石和粘土制成土耐火泥，用盐水代替电阻器，很短时间居然把破痰盂做成土电弧炉，从石头中提炼出硅来。这个系的教师虽然有多年教学经验，但是却缺乏实际操作知识，现在，他们已炼出合金钢及碳钢等共达一百二十四种，新建了一个年产五万吨的小型钢铁联合企业，并设计了从三立方公尺到一百立方公尺的高炉的图纸，供给了数以百计的单位使用。
    在四川馆里，展出的共有二百八十多套、一千六百多件展品。这里陈列着各地师生用野生树皮、藤、草制出的二百多种野生纤维。有一床用稻草纤维制成的棉絮，像真正的棉絮一样洁白、柔软，很难让人分辨出来。这里有一百四十多种液体和粉剂的农药，泛着各种颜色的光泽，它们对防治稻瘟病、螟虫、棉花各期害虫以及其他作物病虫害，有着良好效用。这些都是西南农学院、四川农学院、简阳第四初中等校师生学习农民经验，以神农尝百草精神，在田野山林采集各种野生植物和药材制成的。制作方法简便，成本也很低廉。
    山西：种试验田也办工厂
    山西各级学校都在开展勤工俭学，既种试验田，也办工厂。在山西馆陈列着全省大中小学几十万人大战钢铁的展品，单是长治专区二百五十一所中学即日产铁四万吨左右，阳城县第二中学放出日产钢一百一十五吨的卫星。现在，全省大中学校班班有厂，小学校校有厂，生产着各式各样的产品。全省中等以上学校的师生还大批下乡下厂上山，根据到8月底的统计，全省参加工农业生产和公益劳动的达一百四十二万人次。太原水利学校的师生下乡五个月，走遍八十四个县，为一千六百五十一个乡订了三十六条河系河域的治理规划，测量渠道十二万条，灌溉面积达三千五百六十万亩。
    各学校的科学研究也很活跃。太原工学院四百多师生苦战十天即完成二百零二项题目中的七十多项，有电子模拟计算机、轧球机、塑料油毡以及精密车床等；山西医学院在8、9两个月完成技术革新八百二十五项。
    这里还展出了有关“十八个小革新家和创造家”的成就。其中一组是介绍解虞县乡头小学以尚马朝为首的一群红领巾，他们用嫁接法培植成几种“两层楼”植物，一株植物“楼上”（茎秆）是蕃茄，“楼下”（根部）却长了马铃薯；另一株植物“楼上”是向日葵，“楼下”是洋姜。他们又用向日葵和棉花嫁接，要收黑色的棉花；用十多种植物的花粉和棉花杂交，希望培育出红、黄等有色棉花。
    辽宁：到处是钢铁机械
    辽宁是祖国重工业的心脏。走进辽宁馆，立刻给人一种突出的印象，这里到处是钢铁和机械。
    全省高等和中等学校开办的五千多个工厂，在支援祖国的工业建设上放出了灿烂的光芒。你看，那东北工学院用煤炼钢的小平炉，是世界炼钢工业技术上的一个创举。这种小平炉可以在县乡普遍推广。大连六中利用油桶炼出优质钢，开原朝鲜中学用土高炉炼出大量的铁，都说明了钢铁工业已经在辽宁全省学校里开了花。
    机械工业在学校里也放出了光彩。大连海运学院制造的世界上第一个蒸汽机船桥控制，是展览会中许多尖端产品中的一件。有了船桥控制的应用，驾驶员可以在船桥上直接操纵船机，将会大大提高运转上和管理上的机动性和准确性，减轻轮机员的繁重体力劳动，减少轮机管理人员，消灭过去航行上不应有的海损事故。
    辽宁省各大中学校在勤工俭学中在电力、化工、医药等方面也获得了许多成就。在“哪里需要电，哪里就办电”的口号下，各大中学校大办发电厂。一幅大图表告诉观众，不到两个月，仅沈阳市普通中学就有十三个学校建立了发电厂，发电量是十六万多瓩。沈阳第一化工学校师生研究试制成功的机械加工必需的“金钢砂”，质量达到5000号，超过了3500号的西德产品。沈阳医学院师生研究试制成了达到国际水平的“移动式爱克司光诊疗机”，透视、照相都不用暗室，体积小、能随意移动，便于城镇、农村推广使用。沈阳药学院师生结合生产劳动进行并完成的一百多项课题中有三十三项达到了国际或国内先进水平。其中外科止血必用的“明胶海绵”，吸水力是1∶68，超过了美国的1∶50，更超过了英国的1∶30。
    黑龙江：第一个无文盲省
    黑龙江是全国第一个无文盲省，目前全省已经普及了幼儿教育、小学教育和初中教育，中等专业学校和大专学校也遍布全省各地，并且提出要在五年内全民普及中等教育，在十年内全民普及高等教育。
    党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，已经在黑龙江大放光彩。目前，全省的中小学和大专学校的每个系、科都建立了工厂和农场。各地学校大搞钢铁、机械、粮食生产，并且已经生产了大批新产品。哈尔滨工业大学生产的一千三百二十二项新产品中，就有四百八十项达到国际国内先进水平，其中有我国第一台电力系统的动态模型，标志着我国电力系统的研究工作已经跨入世界科学的最前列。该校还制成了五台电子模拟计算机，其中有一台万用组合电子模拟计算机，可以为导弹、锅炉、汽轮机、水轮机的设计进行各种模拟试验。东北农学院制造的高效杀虫剂E605，对农作物害虫具有特效功能。黑龙江许多中等学校也出现了攀登科学高峰的产品。哈尔滨六中制造的金属陶瓷刀已经超过美国技术水平。哈尔滨十六中制成的半导体元素锗，牡丹江朝鲜中学制造的电子限时器和海伦一中创造的收音、转播、通话、会议使用的四用无线电机，质量也很好。
