Today's Baotou
By our reporter Lin Tian

Every day, just as the sun rises, the glass windows of factories and buildings in front of the Daqing Mountains and the Wula Mountains reflect a red glow, and the chimneys and cooling towers that pierce the clear sky spew out plumes of black smoke and white heat. Whistles echo everywhere, and the wide roads are bustling with men and women going to and from work. Outside the city, on new construction sites, countless fire-like red flags flutter, and amid the dense forest of buildings and scaffolding are people working selflessly. In the evening, from the foot of the Daqing and Wula Mountains to the Yellow River, a sea of lights shines like stars. The flames of small blast furnace clusters illuminate the sky, and the earthen coke oven clusters resemble clusters of bonfires. Welders emit "lightning" at construction sites everywhere.

This is Baotou. It is the largest emerging industrial city in Inner Mongolia and one of the three major steel bases in the motherland.

On the eve of liberation, Baotou had only four dilapidated small factories, and the entire city had only seventeen dim streetlights. After liberation, the Communist Party led the people of all ethnic groups in economic recovery and reconstruction.

The national construction industry representatives who recently attended an on-site conference in Baotou said: Baotou is one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. Indeed, in just five or six years, Baotou has developed from a commercial city with a population of over 100,000 to an industrial city with a population of 650,000. The city's newly added industrial and civil construction area has reached more than 3 million square meters, which is more than four times the total construction area in 1952.

The new industries and the new urban areas have all started from scratch.

Let's take a look at Baotou Steel first!

Last spring, when I first went to Baotou, I took a car from the old city through a road stretching across the grassland, traveled more than 20 kilometers, and arrived at the Baotou Steel worker residential area, which was under construction. I saw many workers building houses on the sandy land. A secretary of the Baotou Steel General Company led us to the factory area. He pointed enthusiastically and said: From the foot of the mountain to the south, there are our ore dressing and sintering plants, coking plants, iron-smelting plants, steel-smelting plants, primary rolling plants, large rolling mills, and rail and beam rolling mills... In fact, at that time, what we saw before us was a vast expanse of sand dunes. But what about now? The majestic furnace body and hot blast stove of the nation's largest No. 1 blast furnace in the iron-smelting plant have been erected! The 70-meter-high giant tower crane raises its giant arm, lifting the last few massive furnace rings one by one into the sky. The large red-letter slogans on the furnace body read: "Work hard and fight fiercely, catch up with Shijiazhuang Steel, surpass Wuhan; work hard for thirty-five (days), strive for twenty-six, and create the highest record for blast furnace shell installation!" These installation workers and welders were not exaggerating. The original plan was to install twenty-two rings of the furnace shell in two and a half months, but they installed seventeen rings in twenty days. According to conventional procedures, it would take forty-five days to install a hot blast stove, but they installed two in seven days and sixteen hours. Each stove is more than forty meters high, and the steel plate welds alone are twelve li long. Within a radius of more than ten li in the factory area, there are construction complexes everywhere, and everywhere there is a constant flow of vehicles and the sounds of machines. In the first half of the year, their central slogan was to produce iron by "October 1st" next year, but now it has been changed to: produce steel by "October 1st" next year.

Paralleling the steel area is a burgeoning mechanical industrial area. A few days ago, we watched construction workers launch rapid construction satellites in this area. The workers were to build a plant with a construction area of 18,000 square meters in twenty-three days. Several cranes were installing beams and frames. We saw a female driver operating a large crane, placing a large concrete truss on the high column top every few minutes. The bricklayers stood on mobile scaffolding, pulling the pulley chain every now and then, and the scaffolding would rise upwards. This factory building was visibly growing taller. This is a highly organized battle. A worker's quick-rhyme poem reads: The construction team is militarized, the ideology is communized, the tools in hand are guns, going to work is like going to the battlefield, every inch of time is an inch of steel, not a second can be wasted.

What Baotou Steel has driven is not only a batch of large enterprises, but also a situation where large enterprises lead medium-sized ones, and medium-sized ones lead small ones, resulting in a blooming of large, medium, and small industries. At present, the city has 140 industrial and mining enterprises under the city and districts, and 659 privately-run factories. The satellite factories of the major factories are not included. Before the Great Leap Forward, Baotou's local industry mainly served the construction of large industries and the people's lives in the city. At that time, people thought that Baotou would have a direct impact on the economic development of the autonomous region after the industrial base was basically completed. But now, the situation has greatly changed. Baotou is already able to manufacture automobiles and tractors, and can produce complete sets of small blast furnace equipment ranging from 13 cubic meters to 80 cubic meters in batches. It can also manufacture steelmaking equipment such as open-hearth furnaces below 20 tons and converters below 6 tons. In the third quarter alone, the local industrial system produced 42 sets of small blast furnace equipment above 13 cubic meters for various parts of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In addition, it also produced many small and medium-sized smelting equipment, mining equipment, electrical equipment, cement manufacturing equipment, sugar manufacturing equipment, and hundreds of boiler-locomotives. After the nationwide steelmaking movement was launched, small blast furnaces and earthen blast furnaces sprang up like forests throughout the city. Four steelmaking converters and one electric furnace have been put into production. By the end of the year, the city will produce 100,000 tons of iron and 85,000 tons of steel. Baotou has taken on the task of equipping the autonomous region's industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry ahead of schedule.

Baotou will not only provide the country with large-sized steel products, heavy steel rails, steel beams, and other products, provide equipment for the technological revolution in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, but also provide talent for the autonomous region, especially to cultivate a modern workforce for the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia. At present, Baotou has 130,000 employees, a considerable part of whom are technical workers from large cities such as Anshan, Shenyang, Shanghai, and Beijing. People respectfully call them the "mother machine" of Inner Mongolia's technical strength. The Baotou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Party Committees of large enterprises such as Baotou Steel attach special importance to the training of Mongolian and other ethnic minority employees in the region. At present, there are more than 5,000 employees of Mongolian, Hui, Daur, and other ethnic groups in the city. Among them, the number of Mongolian employees has increased more than tenfold compared to 1952, and some of them hold leadership positions in Baotou Steel General Company and various factories and mines. A few days ago, we met several Mongolian young men on a large electric shovel that had just arrived on the Baiyunebo iron ore mountain. They had all just been demobilized from the cavalry unit, studied culture at the Baotou Steel Technical School, and then came to learn to be electric shovel operators. One of the round-faced, rosy-cheeked young man, Sejilahu, enthusiastically told us about the performance and structure of this large electric shovel: it can shovel four cubic meters of ore in one scoop, which is equivalent to ten tons... I asked him: "Can you operate it?" He said: "With the guidance of Han Chinese master workers, I can do it. We used to herd cattle when we were young, and then we joined the army and rode horses. I never thought that I could operate this big guy today." He smiled happily as he spoke.

    今日包头
    本报记者　林田
    每天，太阳刚刚升起的时候，大青山和乌拉山前一排排的工厂和楼房的玻璃窗上便反射出一片红霞，突入晴空的烟囱和冷却塔，吐出团团黑烟和白色的热气。汽笛四处呼应，宽阔的马路两旁，上下班的男女职工熙熙攘攘。街市以外新的建设工地上，飘着无数面火似的红旗，密林似的建筑物和脚手架上面和四周是忘我劳动的人们。一到晚间，从大青山和乌拉山脚到黄河边，一片灯光如同繁星。四处的小高炉群的火焰映红了天空，土焦炉群像一丛丛篝火，电焊工们在各处工地上放出“闪电”。
    这里，就是包头。就是内蒙古最大的新兴工业城市，祖国三大钢铁基地之一。
    解放前夕，包头只有四个破烂的小工厂，全市只有十七盏半明不灭的路灯。解放以后，共产党领导各族人民进行了经济恢复和改造工作。
    最近在包头开现场会议的全国建筑业代表参观以后说：包头是全国发展得最快的城市之一。的确，在短短的五、六年里，包头从一个十多万人口的商业城市发展成了六十五万人的工业城市。全市新增的工业和民用建筑面积达三百多万平方公尺，等于1952年所有建筑面积的四倍多。
    新的工业，新的市区，都是平地起家。
    让我们先看看包钢吧！
    去年春天，我第一次到包头，从旧市区坐汽车通过一条伸展在草原上的马路，走了二十多公里，来到了正兴工的包钢职工居住区，看见许多工人在沙地上盖房子。包钢总公司一位秘书领我们到了厂区。他手指一伸兴致勃勃地讲道：从山根向南，是我们的选矿烧结厂、焦化厂、炼铁厂、炼钢厂、初轧厂、大型轧钢厂、轨梁轧厂……。实际上，当时，我们眼前却是一片沙丘旷野。可是现在呢？炼铁厂里全国最大的一号高炉雄伟的炉体和热风炉站起来啦！七十多公尺高的大塔式吊车，抬起巨臂，把最后几圈庞大的炉圈一个个举向高空。炉体上的大红字标语写着：“苦干恶战，赶石钢，超武汉；大干三十五（天），争取二十六，创造高炉外壳安装最高纪录！”这些安装工和电焊工们不是说大话，原计划两个半月安装好二十二圈炉体外壳，他们二十天就安好了十七圈。按常规，要四十五天安装一座热风炉，他们七天十六小时安了两座，每座高四十多公尺，光是钢板焊接缝合起来就有十二里路长。在厂区方圆十几里之内，到处是建筑群，到处是车水马龙机器叫。上半年他们的中心口号还是明年“十一”出铁，现在又改为：明年“十一”出钢。
    和钢铁区比翼的，是一个新兴的机械工业区。前几天，我们在这个区看过建筑工人们放快速施工卫星。工人们要用二十三天时间建成一座建筑面积一万八千平方公尺的厂房，几部吊车正安装梁架。我们看到一个女驾驶员操纵着一个大吊车，每隔几分钟就把一根大混凝土桁架放在高高的柱顶上。砌墙的人站在活动脚手架上，隔一会拉一拉滑车链子，脚手架就向上升起。这厂房眼看向上长。这是一种有高度组织性的战斗。工人的快板诗写道：建筑队伍军事化，思想共产主义化，手中工具就是枪，上班就是上战场，一寸光阴一寸钢，一秒时间不能让。
    包钢带动起来的，不仅是一批大企业，而且大的带中的，中的带小的，出现了一个大、中、小工业之花齐放的局面。目前全市已有市和区所属工矿一百四十个，民办工厂六百五十九个。各大厂矿的卫星厂还不包括在内。大跃进以前，包头的地方工业主要是为大工业建设和本市人民生活服务的。那时人们设想，包头市要对自治区的经济发展直接起到作用，还要待这个工业基地基本建成以后。但是，现在，情况大变了。包头市已经能够制造汽车、拖拉机，能够成批生产十三立方公尺到八十立方公尺小高炉整套设备，能制造二十吨以下平炉和六吨以下转炉等炼钢设备。第三季度，光是地方工业系统就为内蒙古自治区各地生产了四十二套十三立方公尺以上小高炉设备，此外还生产了许多中小型的冶炼设备、矿山开采设备、电气设备、水泥制造设备、制糖设备和数百部锅驼机等。全民办钢铁的运动掀起以后，全市的小高炉、土高炉已林立成群，四座炼钢转炉和一座电炉已投入生产，到年底，全市要生产十万吨铁，八万五千吨钢。包头市提前担负起了装备自治区工、农、牧业的任务。
    包头，不仅将要为全国提供大型钢材、重型钢轨钢梁等产品，为内蒙古自治区的技术革命提供装备，而且要为自治区提供人材，特别要为内蒙古各族人民培养一支现代工人队伍。现在，包头市已有十三万名职工，其中有相当部分是来自鞍山、沈阳、上海、北京等大城市的技术工人，人们以尊敬的心情把他们称作内蒙古技术力量的“母机”。中共包头市委和包钢等大企业的党委，都特别重视培养蒙古族和区内少数民族职工，现在全市有蒙古、回、达斡尔等民族职工五千多人。其中蒙古族职工比1952年增加了十多倍，他们有的担负着包钢总公司副经理和各厂矿的领导职务。前几天，我们在白云鄂博铁矿山一台刚上山的大电铲上遇到了几个蒙古族小伙子。他们都是刚从骑兵部队复员，在包钢技工学校学了文化，又来学当电铲手的。有一个圆胖红脸的小伙子色吉拉胡热情地向我们讲这个大电铲的性能构造：它一铲能铲四立方矿石，合十来吨，……我问他：“你能开动吗？”他说：“有汉族老师傅指点着能行。我们从小放牛，大了就当兵骑马，没想到今天能开这个大家伙。”说着幸福地笑了。
