Xinhua News Agency, November 1st. More than 20,000 people from all walks of life in the capital held a garden party in Zhongshan Park tonight to welcome the triumphant return of the volunteer heroes and thank them for their great achievements in defending the motherland.

At 7 o'clock, firecrackers and drums were deafening in front of the park gate. General Yang Yong and General Wang Ping led the heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation into the park, accompanied by Peng Zhen, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Secretaries Liu Ren and Chen Kehan, and Vice Mayors of Beijing Wan Li and Cheng Hongyi. From the gate to the Altar of Land and Grain in the center of the park, the cheers and applause of the welcoming crowd erupted like a surging tide. In this peaceful and happy night, wherever the heroes who defended the motherland went, the jubilation reached a climax.

In front of the Altar of Land and Grain, the heroes, accompanied by Peng Zhen, Guo Moruo, Li Jishen, Liao Chengzhi and others, watched the wonderful skills performances by the China Acrobatic Troupe. The Cultural Work Troupe of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army also performed the sixth scene "Battle" from the large-scale living report dance drama "Volunteer Army War Song" for the visiting relatives. While watching the performance, Wu Zuo, a female youth of the Yi nationality, a student of the Central University for Nationalities, could not restrain her inner passion and enthusiastically put big red flowers on the chests of the generals.

In the cypress forest illuminated by thousands of lights, the female militia of the capital's militia division sang the "Chinese People's Volunteer Army War Song" in a majestic manner to pay tribute to the heroes.

In the woods to the west, strings of palace lanterns reflected a scene of joy and happiness. When the heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation arrived, the music suddenly started, and bursts of cheers erupted from the crowd. At this time, Li Yanning, a student from Beijing No. 9 Girls' Middle School, rushed forward and tied a red scarf around the neck of Han Chengwan, a third-class meritorious person. In front of Zhongshan Hall, the mercury lights shone brightly, and students from Peking University were performing a newly arranged program "Heroic Praise Medley," singing praises to the immortal feats of the Volunteer Army heroes. After the performance, countless red flowers and colored paper pieces were thrown at the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers who were watching the program.

Near the northwest side of the Peace Preservation Memorial Archway, bursts of warm applause came. The Volunteer Army representatives were performing Korean folk dances at the enthusiastic request of the welcomers, and then danced with everyone. The dance music has been repeated more than ten times, and people's dancing spirit is getting stronger and stronger. (Attached picture)

    欢迎抗美的英雄　欢迎卫国的功臣
    首都各界举行游园大会
    新华社1日讯　首都各界人民两万多人今晚在中山公园举行游园大会，欢迎凯旋归来的志愿军英雄们，感谢他们为保卫祖国立下的丰功伟绩。
    七时，公园门前，鞭炮齐鸣，锣鼓震天，杨勇上将和王平上将率领的志愿军代表团的英雄们，在中共北京市委第一书记彭真、书记刘仁、陈克寒和北京市副市长万里、程宏毅等陪同下，进入园内。从大门到园中心的社稷坛，夹道欢迎的人们，爆发出的欢呼声和掌声，像海涛一样澎湃。在这和平幸福的夜晚，保卫祖国的英雄们走到那里，那里的欢腾就形成了高潮。
    在社稷坛前，英雄们在彭真、郭沫若、李济深、廖承志等陪同下，观看了中国杂技团演出的精彩的技艺节目。中国人民志愿军政治部文艺工作团也为游园的亲人们演出了大型活报舞剧“志愿军战歌”中的第六场“战斗”等节目。在观看演出时，中央民族学院学生、彝族女青年乌佐等遏制不住内心的激情，热情地把大红花挂在将军们的胸前。
    在万盏灯火辉映的柏树林里，首都民兵师的女民兵们雄壮地唱起“中国人民志愿军战歌”，向英雄们致敬。
    西边树林里，成串的宫灯映照出一片喜气盈盈的景象。当志愿军代表团的英雄们来到时，乐声骤起，人丛中迸发出阵阵欢呼声。这时，北京市第九女中学生李延宁涌上前去，把红领巾系在三等功臣韩承万的脖上。在中山堂前，水银灯照得通亮，北京大学的学生正在表演新排出来的节目“英雄赞大联唱”，歌赞志愿军英雄们的不朽功勋。表演完毕，无数朵红花和彩色纸片投向正在观看节目的志愿军官兵们。
    在保卫和平纪念牌坊西北边，传来一阵阵热烈的掌声。志愿军代表正在应欢迎者热情的要求，表演朝鲜集体舞，接着又和大家一起跳舞。舞曲已经重奏了十多遍，人们的舞兴愈跳愈浓。（附图片）
