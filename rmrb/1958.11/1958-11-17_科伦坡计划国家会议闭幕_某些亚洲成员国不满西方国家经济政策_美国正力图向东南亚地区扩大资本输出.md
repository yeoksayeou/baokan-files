Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 14th: The Colombo Plan Ministerial Conference, which opened in Seattle on November 10th, closed on the evening of the 13th. According to the conference communique, the conference reviewed the economic progress of Southeast Asian countries participating in the plan over the past year and discussed future tasks. The conference adopted an annual report. The communique emphasized the importance of "private investment," especially foreign private investment.

Although the communique emphasized how the "assistance" provided by Western member countries of the Colombo Plan to Asian member countries promoted "economic cooperation," sources revealed that some Asian member countries felt extremely dissatisfied with the damage caused to them by the policies of Western countries.

The chief representative of Pakistan, Pakistani Ambassador to the United States, Ali, stated at the meeting on the evening of the 12th that the increasing price scissors between the export prices of raw materials and the import prices of equipment from underdeveloped countries is harming the economic development of Asian countries with strained economies.

The speech by the chief representative of Indonesia, Foreign Minister Subandrio, also indicated that the lowering of raw material prices by Western countries has caused great damage to economically underdeveloped countries. He pointed out in Seattle that for every penny the price of rubber drops, Indonesia loses 15 million US dollars a year.

According to Western news agencies, the characteristic of this Colombo Plan Ministerial Conference was that the host country, the United States, proposed a "five-point plan for international economic assistance." This "plan" proposed by Eisenhower vigorously advocated that underdeveloped countries in Southeast Asia "absorb" the largest amount of American private investment.

News indicates that the United States attaches great importance to this conference opening up avenues for American private capital to be exported to Southeast Asian countries, and the United States is using its financial resources to seize leadership of this plan.

    科伦坡计划国家会议闭幕
    某些亚洲成员国不满西方国家经济政策
    美国正力图向东南亚地区扩大资本输出
    据新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：11月10日在西雅图召开的科伦坡计划部长级会议已经在13日晚上闭幕。据会议公报说，会议审查了参加这个计划的东南亚国家在过去一年的经济进展，并且讨论了今后的任务。会议通过了一个年度报告。公报强调“私人投资”的重要性，特别是外国私人投资的重要性。
    尽管公报强调了科伦坡计划成员国中的西方成员国给予亚洲成员国的“援助”怎样促进了“经济合作”，但是，据消息透露，某些亚洲成员国对于西方国家的政策所给予它们的损害感到极大的不满。
    巴基斯坦首席代表、巴基斯坦驻美大使阿里12日晚上在会上发言指出，不发达国家的出口原料价格和进口装备价格的越来越大的剪刀差，正在伤害亚洲经济拮据的国家的经济发展。
    印度尼西亚的首席代表、外交部长苏班德里约的发言也表明了西方国家压低原料价格给予经济不发达的国家以很大的损害。他在西雅图指出，橡胶价格每下降一分钱，印度尼西亚一年就损失一千五百万美元。
    据西方通讯社报道，这次科伦坡计划部长级会议的特点是：作为东道国的美国提出了一项“国际经济援助的五点计划”。这项由艾森豪威尔提出的“计划”极力鼓吹东南亚不发达的国家“最大量地吸收”美国的私人投资。
    消息表明，美国十分重视这次会议为美国的私人资本输往东南亚国家开辟道路，并且美国正在以它的财力来夺取这个计划的领导权。
