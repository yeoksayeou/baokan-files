 How can new enterprises be put into production faster?
 The speed of capital construction this year is unprecedented. By the end of September, the employees of the capital construction department had already overfulfilled the annual investment plan of 14.5 billion yuan. The work done in the first three quarters of this year greatly exceeded the entire year of 1957, and also greatly exceeded the entire year of the Great Leap Forward in 1956. Many key projects, such as the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's No. 1 Blast Furnace, the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, and the Lanzhou Refinery, have been put into production several months or even more than a year ahead of schedule.
 However, under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, such a speed cannot satisfy us. After July this year, various provinces and cities added many capital construction projects. Some of these projects were added to complete this year's production leap forward plan. More projects are to prepare for a greater leap forward next year. Judging from this leap forward capital construction plan, the construction tasks in the fourth quarter of this year are still very heavy.
 Industrial production requires rapid growth in construction. Is it possible to complete the construction and put into production a large number of enterprises within a short period of one or two months within the year?
 To answer this question, it is necessary to review the work of the first three quarters. In the past two months, various collaborative regions have successively held capital construction conferences to conduct an analysis and reached the conclusion that under the leadership of the local party committees and the conscientious implementation of the Party's policies, accelerating the construction speed and putting a large number of new enterprises into production at the fastest speed is entirely possible.
 In the first three quarters, the completion of capital construction plans in various provinces and cities was very uneven, some were fast and some were slow. Analyzing the reasons, three policy-oriented problems were found. Solving these three problems can greatly accelerate the speed of capital construction in the fourth quarter and even next year.
 The first question is: In implementing the policy of combining large, medium, and small enterprises, should the focus be on large enterprises? Or on small and medium-sized enterprises? This question was the most common and obvious in the capital construction work of the first three quarters of this year. All those who adopted the approach of focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises completed more projects earlier. Conversely, in places where small projects were not grasped or not grasped tightly, the capital construction plan was not completed well. Some comrades still do not understand that for us at present, the most important thing is speed. And what is the fastest? Only the construction of small and medium-sized enterprises is the fastest. Because medium and small enterprises have less dependence, they can design their own machines, use less materials, and have lower costs. This naturally goes up quickly. Facts have proved that it is not large and few projects, but small and many projects that are more suitable for our current needs. Large enterprises are highly efficient and are indispensable backbones in the national economy, but they are slower to build. Although small enterprises are less efficient, a large number of them can be built in a few months. Moreover, even when building large factories, it is faster to build small factories in stages. So don't be afraid of being small at the beginning, it is easier to develop from small to large. China's characteristic is that it is a large country with a large population. If small enterprises are widely distributed throughout the country, adding more everywhere, it will definitely be much faster than only building a few large enterprises. In order to win time, win initiative, and create conditions for accelerating the construction of large enterprises, a batch of urgently needed small and medium-sized enterprises and reconstruction and expansion projects should be selected at present and built as soon as possible to achieve production results as early as possible.
 The second question is: Should we lengthen the battle line, swarm up, and advance simultaneously? Or should we shorten the battle line, grasp the key points, start in batches, launch assaults in batches, complete a batch, and then start another batch? Practice in various places has proved that adopting the former approach subjectively wants to be fast, but the actual progress is slow; adopting the latter approach seems slow, but the actual progress is accelerated. Taking Beijing as an example, before July, they adopted the former approach, and by July, the construction area reached three million square meters. However, because of dividing the forces and dispersing the use of forces, the material supply was very tight, and one million square meters of projects were in a state of shutdown or semi-shutdown. The progress of many started projects was very slow, and some newly determined key projects could not be started early. By the end of July, a total of only 1.2 million square meters of tasks had been completed. In August, they accepted this lesson, re-ranked all the projects, shortened the battle line, concentrated superior forces to attack key points, and fought annihilation battles. As a result, they completed 1.91 million square meters of tasks in August, September, and October, exceeding the sum of the past seven months. Moreover, many of them were key projects. The completion of these projects not only directly increased production capacity, but also created conditions for more projects to start.
 Some places were relatively slow to adapt capital construction to the situation of the Great Leap Forward, and they were late in grasping the work of ranking; or they were forced to rank in the situation of tight materials, and did not raise the ranking to the policy of capital construction. As a result, although they ranked, they were not determined and ranked incompletely, and finally they were washed away by the objective situation and had to rank again and again, delaying the opportunity. They do not understand that everything is about what not to do, and then can do something. There must be those who go first, and then there must be those who lag behind; there must be key points, and then there must be light points; there must be fast and then there must be slow. Dividing the forces and setting up defenses everywhere, with weak forces everywhere, is a way of fighting a war of attrition. It seems that there are many things going up, but the result is slow progress. Some comrades always want to arrange the capital construction projects of all walks of life in one quarter. These comrades only saw the interconnectedness of the various sectors of the national economy, but did not see that there are priorities, major contradictions and minor contradictions. The experience of running iron and steel in a big way for more than two months has proved that in a certain period, only one outstanding link can be grasped to drive others. There is no absolute balance in the development of the national economy. The so-called corresponding development of various departments can only be corresponding in the main aspects, but not corresponding in every detail. There are also some comrades who always consider taking care of emotions and relationships, giving a little here and a little there. But, what exactly should be taken care of? Is it the speed of socialist construction? Or is it taking care of emotions and relationships? They have not figured this out.
 The third question is: Should we fully mobilize the masses and strive for self-reliance? Or should we rely mainly on central and external assistance? The practice in many places this year has proved that adopting the latter approach is slow, and adopting the former approach is fast. For example, building materials and machinery and equipment are the two things in the tightest supply in this year's capital construction. Some places do not mobilize the masses to solve them, and rely solely on central allocation and external support. As a result, many construction projects fell through. Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui and other provinces mobilized the masses to build indigenous cement in a big way, which solved a big problem. Henan Province also manufactured 25 sets of small rolling mills by itself. They are now being put into production one after another, and it is planned to roll 30,000 tons of steel to meet the needs of local construction this winter. Sichuan, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have done equally well in solving equipment problems. They mobilized the masses to manufacture equipment in a big way with small machines and indigenous methods. In Chongqing, all factories with expansion tasks this year have manufactured all their own equipment. Currently, the largest equipment in the country, such as a 12-meter-long gantry planer and a 5-meter-diameter vertical lathe, have been made with indigenous methods and small machines. Some provinces and cities are no worse than Chongqing in terms of conditions, but the factory buildings built at the same time are still empty and waiting for equipment. In Chongqing, however, machine tools have long been installed and production has begun.
 The experience of running iron and steel in a big way for more than two months has proved that any work can be done more, faster, better, and more economically by adopting the method of mass movement; without mass movement, it will be done less, slower, worse, and more expensive. Capital construction is of course no exception. However, some comrades have not truly understood this truth. They do not deeply understand that equipment is dead, people are alive, and conditions are created by people. They do not believe in the power of the masses, and do not believe that after mobilizing the masses, backward areas can also create miracles, and latecomers can also surpass. Since they do not believe in the masses, what do they rely on to complete the task? Therefore, they have to wait for foreign aid. This is the logic of these comrades. Recently, due to the lessons of facts, many places have begun to mobilize the masses to make self-reliance plans, which is a welcome phenomenon.
 The above three questions are all policy-oriented questions in capital construction. Solving these problems will inevitably go through a period of ideological struggle. Therefore, in order to thoroughly solve these three problems and make cadres and workers consciously accept and implement the correct construction policy, party organizations at all levels must directly grasp this matter, and the secretaries must personally take command and conscientiously do ideological work. After the ideological problem is solved, a broad mass movement should be launched immediately to implement it in action. All links such as design, equipment manufacturing, building material production, construction, and transportation must be moved together and speed up in a coordinated manner. All designers and all employees of construction units should be mobilized to review the design and study which parts are the light points of the key points and can be built slowly; which parts can be transformed from large to small, or small first and then large, and built in stages. All employees of the machine manufacturing department should be mobilized to build equipment on their own. The masses should be widely mobilized to make their own building materials, participate in transportation work and auxiliary labor on construction sites. With the correct policy, plus such a broad mass movement, we can victoriously complete this year's capital construction leap forward plan and be fully prepared to welcome a greater leap forward next year.

### 怎样才能使新建企业更快地投入生产？

    怎样才能使新建企业更快地投入生产？
    今年基本建设的速度是空前的。到9月底，基本建设部门的职工就已超额完成了一百四十五亿元的全年投资计划。今年前三个季度所做的工作，大大超过了1957年全年，也大大超过了跃进的1956年全年。许多重点工程，像武钢一号高炉、武汉重型机床厂、兰州炼油厂等等，都提前几个月甚至一年以上投入了生产。
    但是，在大跃进的形势下，这样的速度已不能使我们满足。今年7月以后，各省市都追加了许多基本建设项目。这些项目，有一些是为了完成今年生产跃进计划而增加的。更多的项目则是为了准备迎接明年更大的跃进。从这个跃进的基本建设计划来看，今年第四季度的建设任务还是很繁重的。
    工业生产要求建设快速度的增长，要使大批的企业在年内短短的一两个月中建设完成投入生产，这能不能实现呢？
    为了回答这个问题，需要对前三个季度的工作做一番回顾。最近两个月各协作地区先后召开了基本建设会议，进行了一番分析，得出了结论：在各地党委领导下，认真贯彻党的方针，加快建设速度，使大批新建企业以最快的速度投入生产，是完全可以实现的。
    前三个季度，各省市基本建设计划完成的情况很不平衡，有的快，有的慢。分析其原因，找到了三个带有方针性的问题。解决这三个问题，第四季度以至明年的基本建设速度就可以大大加快。
    第一个问题是：在贯彻大中小企业相结合的方针中，是以大企业为主呢？还是以中小企业为主？在今年前三个季度的基本建设工作中，这个问题表现得最为普遍，也最为明显。凡是采取以中小为主的地方，完成的项目就多就早。相反，对于小项目没有去抓或没有抓紧的地方，基本建设计划就完成得不好。有些同志至今还不了解，目前对我们来说，最主要的是速度。而什么最快呢？只有中小型的企业建设起来最快。因为中的小的依赖性小，可以自己设计，自己造机器，材料用得少，成本也低。这样就自然上去得快。事实证明，不是项目大而少、而是项目小而多，更适合我们目前的需要。大企业效率高，是国民经济中必不可少的骨干，但是建设起来比较慢些。而小企业效率虽然低一些，但几个月就可以建成一大批。而且，即使搞大厂，也以先建小厂分期建设来得快。所以开始不要怕小，从小发展到大，就比较容易了。我国的特点是国大人多，如果把小的企业广泛分布在全国各地，到处加番，肯定地比只搞少数大的企业速度要快得多。为了赢得时间，赢得主动，为了给加快大企业的建设创造条件，在目前尤应选一批急需的中小型企业和改建、扩建项目，尽先地进行建设，以便及早发挥生产成效。
    第二个问题是：把战线拉长，一拥而上，齐头并进呢？还是缩短战线，抓住重点，分批上马，分批突击，完成一批，再上一批？各地的实践证明，采取前一种做法是主观上想快，而实际进度却慢了；采取后一种做法好像慢了，实际进度反而加快了。以北京市为例，7月份以前，他们采取前一种做法，到7月份，开工面积达到了三百万平方公尺。但是，因为分兵把口，分散使用力量，材料供应十分紧张，有一百万平方公尺的工程陷于停工半停工状态。许多已开工的工程进度十分缓慢，新确定的一些重点工程也不能及早开工。到7月底，一共只完成了一百二十万平方公尺的任务。8月份，他们接受了这一教训，对所有的工程重新排了队，缩短战线，集中优势兵力突击重点，打歼灭战。结果，8、9、10三个月完成了一百九十一万平方公尺的任务，超过了过去七个月的总和。而且，其中许多是重点工程，这些工程完成以后，不仅直接增加了生产能力，而且为更多的工程上马创造了条件。
    有些地方，对于如何使基本建设适应大跃进的形势，转得比较迟，对排队的工作抓得晚了一些；或者是在材料紧张的形势下被迫排队，而没有把排队提高到基本建设的方针上来认识，结果虽然排了队，但决心不大，排得不彻底，终于又被客观形势冲垮，不得不一排再排，贻误时机。他们不了解，凡事都是有所不为，然后才可以有所为。有先行，就得有后进；有重点，就得有轻点；有快就得有慢。分兵把口，处处设防，处处力量薄弱，这是一种打消耗战的做法，看来上去的多，但结果前进得慢。有些同志总想在一个季度里把各行各业的基本建设项目都排上去。这些同志只看到了国民经济各部门相互联系的一面，而没有看到其中有轻有重，有主要矛盾、次要矛盾的这一面。两个多月来大办钢铁的经验证明，在一定的时期，只能抓一个突出的环节来带动其他。在国民经济的发展中，绝对的平衡是没有的。所谓各部门要相应地发展，也只能是主要方面相应，而不是分毫不差地相应。还有一些同志，总是考虑要照顾情绪和关系，给这里搞一点，也给那里搞一点。但是，到底应该照顾什么？是照顾社会主义建设的速度呢？还是照顾情绪和关系？对于这，他们却没有弄清。　
    第三个问题是：充分发动群众，力求自力更生呢？还是以依赖中央和外地援助为主？今年许多地方的实践证明，采取后一种做法就慢，采取前一种做法就快。例如，建筑材料和机器设备，是今年基本建设中供应最紧张的两样东西。有些地方不发动群众来解决，一味依靠中央调拨，外地支援，结果许多建设项目落了空。而河南江苏安徽等省发动群众大搞土水泥，解决了很大的问题。河南省还自己动手制造二十五套小轧钢机，现在正陆续投入生产，计划轧制三万吨钢材，以满足今冬地方建设的需要。四川、安徽、江苏等省在解决设备问题上，做得同样出色。他们发动群众用小机器、土办法大造设备。在重庆，今年所有有扩建任务的工厂，全部设备都是自己制造的。目前在全国要算是最大型的设备，如十二公尺长的龙门刨、五公尺直径的立车，他们都用土办法和小机器做出来了。有些省市，条件并不比重庆差，但是同时建设起来的厂房，至今还在空空荡荡地等待设备。而在重庆，却早已安上机床，开始生产了。
    两个多月来大办钢铁的经验证明，任何工作，采取群众运动的办法，就做得多快好省；不搞群众运动，就做得少慢差费。基本建设工作当然也不例外。但是，有些同志没有真正领会这个道理。他们没有深切了解，设备是死的，人是活的，条件是人创造的。他们不相信群众的力量，不相信把群众发动起来以后，落后的地区也可以创造奇迹，后来者也可以居上。既然不相信群众，那么，依靠什么来完成任务呢？于是，只好等待外援。这就是这些同志的逻辑。最近，由于事实的教训，有许多地方已经开始发动群众作自力更生的打算，这是值得欢迎的现象。
    上面这三个问题，都是基本建设中带有方针性的问题。解决这些问题，不可免地要经过一番思想斗争。因此，要透彻地解决这三个问题，使干部和职工自觉地接受和执行正确的建设方针，就必须各级党组织直接来掌握这件事情，书记要亲自挂帅，认真做好思想工作。而在思想问题解决之后，就要立即发动一个广泛的群众运动来在行动上加以贯彻。要使得设计、设备制造、建筑材料生产、施工、运输等各个环节都一齐动作起来，协调一致地加快速度。要发动所有的设计人员和施工单位的全体职工来审查设计，研究哪些部分是重点中的轻点，可以缓建；哪些可以化大为小，或先小后大，分期建设。要发动机器制造部门的全体职工，自力更生大造设备。要广泛发动群众自制建筑材料、参加交通运输工作和施工现场的辅助劳动。有了正确的方针，再加上一个这样广泛的群众运动，我们就可以胜利地完成今年的基本建设跃进计划，并且充分做好准备，迎接明年更大的跃进。
