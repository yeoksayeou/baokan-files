The Fourth Branch Party of the Star Arrow Commune
Has Good Methods for Managing the Canteen
Commune Members Eat Their Fill Every Meal and Eat Well
Cooks and Breeders Work Happily
Mothers with Children Are Especially Worry-Free

(According to this newspaper) This newspaper reports that the Chinese Communist Party branch of the Fourth Company of the Star Arrow People's Commune in Nantong County, Jiangsu Province, cares about the collective life of commune members and has created relatively successful management experience.

The collective life of the commune members in this company has the following characteristics:

The first characteristic is that all five canteens in the company have newly opened vegetable gardens next to them and built pig farms; the canteen, vegetable garden, and pig farm are linked together. This company established two canteens before communization. At that time, the canteen did not rely on the vegetable garden, and the vegetable garden did not rely on the pig farm. The cooks ran to faraway places to pick vegetables, wasting manpower and time; the vegetables in the vegetable garden did not grow well because of insufficient fertilizer sources. After learning this lesson, the company and platoon cadres, under the leadership of the Party branch, created the good experience of linking the canteen, vegetable garden, and pig farm together. Now, every canteen, as soon as you walk out of the door, you see a green vegetable field. When all five canteens in the company were first established, vegetables had to be bought in towns. Now, with strengthened management, they have achieved complete self-sufficiency. In early October, two or three people shared a bowl of vegetables. Now, everyone can eat one or two bowls of fresh vegetables. The taste is very good, and the commune members are satisfied. Because the pig farm is close to the vegetable garden and the canteen, the source of green feed and concentrated feed for the pigs is abundant, and the pigs are raised in large numbers and well. In the past month, commune members have eaten eight pigs for free. The Party branch, considering the convenience of management, has decided to unify the cooks, breeders, and vegetable garden managers under the leadership of the canteen director.

The second characteristic is that the locations of the kindergartens and nurseries are close to the canteen, meeting the needs of women. Mothers with babies can conveniently breastfeed while eating, and it is also convenient for the children to drink tea with their meals. Initially, the company and platoon cadres had no experience and put the nurseries and kindergartens wherever there were empty houses. As a result, the locations were relatively far from the public canteens. Women with breastfeeding children had to take their meals to the nurseries and eat while breastfeeding, running more every day and affecting their working hours. After the company's Party branch discovered this situation in early October, it immediately discussed with the masses and vacated houses next to the canteen for the kindergartens and nurseries to live in. Now, all five kindergartens and nurseries in the company are close neighbors to the public canteen. One hundred percent of the women are eating their meals in the canteen with peace of mind, and more children are being sent to nurseries than before.

The third characteristic is that the canteen is set up by platoon, so the platoon leader's office is also next to the canteen. If there are any production activities, the canteen director and cooks will know immediately, which can better arrange the canteen work and meet the needs of production. (Liang Guangjing)

### 星箭公社第四连党支部  管理食堂办法好

    星箭公社第四连党支部
    管理食堂办法好
    社员顿顿吃得饱吃得好
    炊事员饲养员干得高兴
    有孩子的妈妈特别省心
    本报讯　江苏南通县星箭人民公社第四连的中共党支部，关心社员集体生活，创造了比较成功的管理经验。
    这个连的社员集体生活有以下几个特色：
    第一个特色，全连五个食堂，每个食堂旁边都新开辟了菜园，建了养猪场；食堂、菜园、养猪场三条线联在一起。这个连在公社化之前就办起两个食堂。当时食堂不靠菜园，菜园不靠猪场，炊事员跑到很远地方挑菜，浪费人力，浪费时间；菜园因为肥源不足，菜也长得不好。连排干部接受这一教训，在党支部领导下，就创造了食堂、菜园、养猪场三条线联在一起的好经验。现在，每个食堂一走出大门，就看到一片绿色的菜地。全连五个食堂，在才办的时候，蔬菜要到市镇上去买。现在加强了经营管理，达到全部自给。10月初，还是两三个人合吃一碗菜，现在每人可吃一碗到两碗新鲜菜，味口很好，社员吃得满意。由于养猪场靠近菜园和食堂，猪子的青饲料和精饲料的来源丰富，猪子养得多养得好，最近一个月社员不花钱吃了八头猪。党支部想到管理上的便利，已决定将炊事员、饲养员和管理菜园的人统一受食堂主任领导。
    第二个特色是幼儿园和托儿所的地点都紧靠食堂，满足妇女们的要求。有婴儿的母亲，在吃饭的时候可以顺便喂奶，幼儿们吃饭用茶水也很便利。最初，连排干部没有经验，看到哪里有空屋，就把托儿所和幼儿园放在哪里，结果，地点离开公共食堂都比较远，有孩子吃奶的妇女，只好把饭菜领到托儿所去吃，一边吃饭，一边给孩子吃奶，每天多跑路，影响了劳动时间。10月初，连的党支部发现这一情况以后，立即和群众商量，在食堂旁边腾出房子，让幼儿园和托儿所住。现在全连五个幼儿园和托儿所都与公共食堂成为亲密的邻居。妇女们百分之百的安心地坐在食堂内吃饭了，送托的孩子也比以前多了。
    第三个特色是食堂是以排为单位设立，所以排长办公室也在食堂旁边，生产上有什么活动，食堂主任和炊事员马上就知道了，可以更好地安排食堂工作，满足生产上的需要。　　（梁光景）
