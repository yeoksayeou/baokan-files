Adapting to the Popularization of Culture, Improving the Level of Teachers
Kunshan Xuyong Township, Township-Commune-Brigade-Run Teachers' Colleges

    This newspaper reports that Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, is running teachers' colleges at the commune and brigade level. The entire county has established one teachers' college, seventeen spare-time teachers' universities, and forty-seven spare-time junior normal schools, totaling one hundred and ninety-seven classes with over five thousand students, the majority of whom are currently employed primary and secondary school teachers and cultural and technical school instructors.

    Before liberation, more than two-thirds of school-age children in this county could not attend school, and on average, only one in two hundred people was a middle school student. Now, primary, secondary, and early childhood education have been popularized. There are a total of seven hundred and sixty schools, including agricultural universities, "red and expert" universities, various secondary specialized schools, regular middle schools, agricultural middle schools, primary schools, and kindergartens. There are also fifty various mass cultural and technical schools.

    The rapid development of education has made the contradiction of insufficient teachers in this county prominent, and the political and cultural levels of existing teachers cannot meet the actual needs. In response to this situation, the Kunshan County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China adopted the method of relying on the masses and self-reliance, and launched a movement to run teachers' colleges on a large scale throughout the county. This movement was supported by the broad masses and most teachers from the very beginning, but a small number of people held skeptical attitudes. They said that these schools were not "formal teachers' colleges" and were "just radish stir-frying radish (referring to teachers teaching teachers)." The Party committees of each township and commune launched a "voicing opinions and debating" discussion among all primary and secondary school teachers on "whether or not to run teachers' colleges, whether or not it is possible to run teachers' colleges, and how to run teachers' colleges," criticizing various forms of "formalism" and "conditionalism." In July, Zhouxu Township established a spare-time teachers' university and eighteen spare-time junior normal schools without spending a penny of state money. Less than half a month later, all townships and communes in the county had established teachers' colleges. These teachers' colleges adopted the method of running, debating, and improving simultaneously, and classes started as soon as the framework was set up.

    In the movement to run teachers' colleges on a large scale, Kunshan County did not have teachers, so it implemented "those who are capable should be teachers." Political classes were taught by the heads of the Party committees, and production course teachers were hired from local high-yield field creators and commune and brigade cadres. Textbooks were compiled in conjunction with current production such as deep plowing, autumn planting, and iron smelting. Business classes mainly focused on exchanging experiences and solving problems encountered in current teaching practice, with teachers taking turns to teach.

    This newspaper reports that Sichuan Province's Xuyong County broke superstitions and universally established spare-time teachers' colleges in various townships to address the contradiction that the quality of teachers could not keep up with objective needs in the further development of farmers' spare-time education after the basic elimination of illiteracy. Currently, the county's thirty-nine townships have established forty-one spare-time teachers' colleges, enrolling more than eight hundred and seventy students.

    Xuyong County basically eliminated illiteracy in August of this year. More than 90% of the county's young and middle-aged people have escaped illiteracy. In order to meet the requirements of de-literate students to further study culture and technology, the townships and agricultural communes have established more than four hundred "red and expert" schools. However, the teachers in these "red and expert" schools are still the literacy teachers. These teachers generally only have primary school education. The cultural and educational departments of Xuyong County have adopted revolutionary methods to universally establish spare-time teachers' colleges to improve the cultural level and teaching ability of these teachers.

    At the beginning of establishing the spare-time teachers' colleges, some people expressed doubts about this measure, citing the lack of teachers and teaching materials as reasons. However, after mobilizing the masses and emancipating their minds, these difficulties were smoothly resolved. The principals of these spare-time teachers' colleges are the secretaries of the township Party general branches, with the principals of complete primary schools serving as the teaching directors, and excellent local primary school teachers, agricultural middle school teachers, and transferred cadres serving as part-time teachers. School buildings are also completely utilized from primary school classrooms or old temples. In this way, without spending a penny of state money, the county established forty-one spare-time teachers' colleges in just a few days, basically enrolling all the teachers of the county's "red and expert" schools.

    According to the teaching needs of the "red and expert" schools, the spare-time teachers' colleges generally offer courses in politics, agricultural technology, teaching methodology, language, and mathematics. Some schools also offer music and physical education courses. The politics course is taught by the secretary of the township Party general branch, while agricultural technology is taught by agricultural technicians or the director of the agricultural commune. There are no ready-made teaching materials for any of the courses. They adopt the method of "teaching what is needed and learning what is needed," closely integrating with the actual teaching of the "red and expert" schools, referring to junior high school textbooks, and compiling them by the teachers in charge of the courses, compiling and teaching simultaneously. In terms of teaching methods, the schools also implemented the spirit of mutual teaching and learning of the mass line. For example, in the teaching methodology course, teachers first assign a scope, allowing students to self-study and delve into the teaching materials they use in the "red and expert" schools, raise difficult questions about the content and teaching methods of the teaching materials, organize collective discussions, and then the teachers provide guidance. The teachers also identify some key tutoring objects among the students, frequently understand their learning and teaching situation in the "red and expert" schools, discover problems, and improve their teaching.

    Although Xuyong County has only been running spare-time teachers' colleges for a short time, the broad masses have summarized several benefits: First, it has improved the level of farmer teachers, guaranteed the teaching quality of "red and expert" schools, and made these schools more solid; Second, it has cultivated a group of backbone members with more cultural and scientific knowledge for the mountainous areas; Third, teaching what is needed and learning what is needed, closely integrating with the teaching needs of "red and expert" schools, is conducive to applying what is learned; Fourth, the establishment of schools is simple and economical, without spending a penny of state money, which meets the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical.

### 适应文化普及形势　提高广大教师水平  昆山叙永乡乡社社办师范

    适应文化普及形势　提高广大教师水平
    昆山叙永乡乡社社办师范
    本报讯　江苏省昆山县社社队队办师范，全县共办起了师范专科学校一所，业余师范大学十七所，业余初级师范学校四十七所，总共一百九十七个班，学生已有五千多名，其中绝大部分是在职的中、小学教师和群众文化技术学校教员。
    这个县在解放前有三分之二以上的学龄儿童不能入学，平均二百人中只有一个中学生，现在已普及了中、小学教育和幼儿教育，设有农业大学、红专大学、各种中等专业学校、普通中学、农业中学、小学以及幼儿园等共七百六十所。还有各种群众文化技术学校五十所。
    教育事业的飞跃发展，使得这个县师资不足的矛盾显得突出起来了，现有教师的政治、文化水平也不能适应实际需要。针对这一情况，中共昆山县委采取依靠群众，自力更生的办法，在全县掀起了大办师范学校的运动。这一运动一开始就得到广大群众和大部分教师的拥护，但也有一小部分人抱着怀疑态度。他们说这些学校“这叫什么师范都不正规，还不是萝卜炒萝卜（指教师教教师）”。各乡社党委在全体中小学教师中开展了一次“要不要办师范，能不能办师范，怎样办师范”的鸣放辩论，批判了各种形形色色的“正规论”和“条件论”。7月间，周墅乡不花国家一文钱，办起了一所业余师范大学和十八所业余初级师范学校。之后不到半个月，全县乡乡社社都办起了师范。这些师范学校采取边办边辩论边改进的方法，架子刚一搭起就上课。
    昆山县在大办师范运动中没有教师，就“能者为师”，政治课由党委负责人担任，生产课教师聘请当地高产田创造者和社队干部担任，并结合当前生产如深翻、秋种、炼铁等编写教材。业务课主要是交流经验，解决当前教学实践中遇到的问题，教师是轮流担任的。

    本报讯　四川省叙永县打破迷信，在各乡普遍举办业余师范学校，解决在基本扫盲后进一步发展农民业余教育中师资质量赶不上客观需要的矛盾。现在，全县三十九个乡已开办业余师范学校四十一所，吸收了八百七十多名学员参加学习。
    叙永县是在今年8月基本扫除文盲的。全县青、壮年中，摆脱文盲状态的已达90％以上。为了适应脱盲学员进一步学习文化、技术的要求，各乡和农业社开办了四百多所红专学校。但是，红专学校教师仍然由扫盲教师担任。这些教师一般只有小学文化水平。叙永县文教部门用革命的办法，普遍开办业余师范学校，提高这些教师的文化水平和教学能力。
    在开办业余师范之初，有人以缺乏师资、教材作理由，对这一措施表示怀疑。但在发动群众、解放思想后，这些困难都顺利地解决了。这些业余师范学校的校长，是由各乡党总支书记担任，完全小学校长担任教导主任，由当地优秀的小学教师、农业中学教师和下放干部兼职教师。校舍也完全利用小学课堂或旧庙。这样，没有花国家一个钱，只用几天时间，全县就办起了四十一所业余师范，把全县各红专学校教师基本上全部吸收入学。
    根据红专学校教学的需要，各业余师范一般开设了政治、农业技术、教材教法、语文、数学等课程，部分学校还开设了音乐和体育等课。政治课由乡党总支书记讲授，农业技术则请农业技术干部或农业社主任担任。一切课程都没有现成教材，他们采取“教什么、学什么”的办法，紧密结合红专学校教学实际，参考初中课本，由任课教师编写，边编边讲。在教学方法上，各校也贯彻了群众路线的互教互学精神。比如教材教法这一课程，就是先由教师指定范围，让学员自学和钻研他们在红专学校所用的教材，提出教材内容和教学方法上的疑难问题，组织集体讨论，然后才由教师作指导性讲解。教师们还在学员中确定一些重点辅导对象，经常了解他们学习和在红专学校教学的情况，从中发现问题，改进自己的教学。
    叙永县开办业余师范学校时间虽然很短，但广大群众已总结出几条好处：一、提高了农民教师水平，保证红专学校教学质量，使这些学校更加巩固；二、为山区培养了一批具有更多文化科学知识的骨干分子；三、教什么，学什么，紧密结合红专学校教学需要，便于学以致用；四、学校的创办因陋就简，没花国家一个钱，符合多、快、好、省的要求。
