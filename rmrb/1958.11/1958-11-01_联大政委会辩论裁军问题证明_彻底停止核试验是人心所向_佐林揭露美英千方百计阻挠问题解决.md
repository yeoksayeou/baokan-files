    Xinhua News Agency, 30th, New York dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee concluded its general debate on the disarmament issue on the 28th.

    Soviet delegation head Zorin, in his speech at the meeting on the 28th, summarized the discussions of the past two weeks. He said that the results of the Political Committee's discussion on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing first proved that the Soviet position is correct. No matter how the US representative and their partners tried to drown the discussion of this issue in the general debate on disarmament, no matter how they tried to belittle the significance of this issue, the Committee's discussions irrefutably showed that the issue of an immediate and universal cessation of nuclear weapons testing occupies a primary position among disarmament measures. The vast majority of representatives who spoke at the meeting consistently talked about the urgency of this issue and emphasized the need to solve this problem first. More than thirty countries' representatives supported a complete and thorough cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

    Among the speakers, in addition to the representatives of the socialist countries, the representatives of some Asian and African countries, such as India, Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon, the United Arab Republic, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Ghana, Ethiopia, some neutral countries, such as Sweden, Finland, Austria, and some Latin American countries, such as Mexico, Venezuela, also advocated a complete cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

    Zorin pointed out that many other countries' representatives, for certain reasons, were not able to directly support this demand, which runs counter to US policy, but they also called for a solution to this problem as soon as possible in their speeches, because they considered that the people of the world eagerly hope for the cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

    Zorin then said that the discussion also showed that the United States and Britain, regardless of the demands of the people of the world, including the people of the United States and Britain, opposed a definitive solution to the issue of a complete cessation of nuclear weapons testing. The speeches of the US and British representatives showed that they considered their main task to be to prevent the General Assembly from passing a resolution to stop nuclear testing. Their primary concern was to find various excuses to enable them to escape solving this problem.

    Zorin pointed out that the United States and Britain even put forward reservations on a temporary cessation of nuclear weapons testing, and these reservations prove that they do not want to genuinely and completely stop these tests at all.

    The Soviet representative said that if the General Assembly reflects the opinions of the majority of the United Nations member states, it should finally put forward strong proposals to support the cessation of nuclear explosions.

    When talking about the Soviet proposal to reduce the military budgets of the four major powers, Zorin pointed out that the representatives of the Western countries were silent on this proposal.

    Zorin finally said that if the United Nations does not want to inherit the tragic fate of the "League of Nations", it should finally abandon endless debates and take practical disarmament measures. He said that in order to clear the way for solving the entire disarmament issue, it is extremely important to take some preliminary measures in this regard now. And the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union are in line with this task.

    联大政委会辩论裁军问题证明
    彻底停止核试验是人心所向
    佐林揭露美英千方百计阻挠问题解决
    据新华社30日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会在28日结束了关于裁军问题的一般辩论。
    苏联代表团团长佐林在28日的会议上的发言，归纳了两个多星期来的讨论情况。他说，政治委员会关于停止核武器试验讨论的结果首先证明苏联立场是正确的。不管美国代表和他们的伙伴如何企图把这个问题的讨论淹没在裁军的泛泛辩论之中，不管他们如何企图贬低这个问题的意义，委员会的讨论无可辩驳地表明，立即普遍停止试验核武器的问题在裁军的措施中占首要地位。在会议上发言的绝大多数代表自始至终都谈到这个问题的迫切性，并且强调指出必须首先解决这个问题。三十多个国家的代表都赞成全面地、彻底地停止核武器试验。
    在发言者中，除了各社会主义国家的代表外，主张完全停止核武器试验的还有亚非一些国家的代表，如印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰、阿拉伯联合共和国、伊拉克、沙特阿拉伯、加纳、埃塞俄比亚，一些中立国家，如瑞典、芬兰、奥地利，还有一些拉丁美洲国家，如墨西哥、委内瑞拉。
    佐林指出，许多其他国家的代表由于某些原因没能够直接支持这一同美国政策背道而驰的要求，但是，它们在发言中也呼吁尽快地解决这个问题，因为它们考虑到全世界人民都热望停止核武器试验。
    佐林接着说，讨论同时也表明，美国和英国不顾包括美英两国人民在内的世界各国人民的要求，反对肯定地解决完全停止核武器试验的问题。美英代表的发言表明，他们认为自己的主要任务是阻止大会通过停止核试验的决议。他们首先关心的是寻找各种借口，来使他们得以逃脱解决这个问题。
    佐林指出，美国和英国甚至对暂时停止试验核武器也提出了保留条件，这种保留证明它们根本不想真正地完全停止这些试验。
    苏联代表说，大会如果反映联合国绝大多数会员国的意见，那就应当最后提出有力的主张来支持停止核爆炸。
    在谈到缩减四大国军事预算的苏联建议时，佐林指出，西方国家代表对这个建议都不吭声。
    佐林最后说，如果联合国不想继承“国际联盟”的悲惨的命运，它就应当最后抛开无休止的辩论，而采取实际裁军措施。他说，为了给解决整个裁军问题扫清道路，现在在这方面即使是采取一些初步措施也是极端重要的。而苏联提出的建议就是符合这个任务的。
