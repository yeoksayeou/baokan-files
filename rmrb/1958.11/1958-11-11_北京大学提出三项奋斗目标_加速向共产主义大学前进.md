Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Peking University, having achieved great success in implementing the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics, and education combined with productive labor," is about to launch communist ideological education throughout the university, thoroughly reform teaching, and build a joint base combining teaching, production, and scientific research, in the spirit of continuous revolution, accelerating its pace to build Peking University into a communist university. On the afternoon of the 4th, Lu Ping, First Secretary of the Peking University Party Committee, gave a mobilization report to all teachers, students, and staff.

In his report, Lu Ping said that a communist Peking University should have three main hallmarks, and this reform will be carried out according to these three hallmarks. First, firmly establish the leadership of the Party, and bring the production, teaching, and scientific research of the school, departments, and classes all under the leadership of the school Party committee, general branch, and branch, and ensure that all are carried out under the guidance of communist ideology. Second, the internal structure of the school must be a joint base of teaching, production, and scientific research. The teachers and cadres working here should be laborers, and the students studying here are students, workers, and researchers. Third, the scientific level should reach the international advanced level.

Since the beginning of this year, Peking University, on the basis of the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, has launched movements such as "double anti," the great debate on teaching, work-study programs, and the great leap forward in scientific research, and has carried out a series of struggles against the bourgeois education policy. Now, this struggle has achieved a decisive victory: the Party's education policy has been accepted by the majority of teachers and students not only in action but also in thought, and the Party has established overall leadership in the school. The school has now established thirty-five factories. After production practice, the students compiled 184 teaching syllabuses and 111 teaching materials, and completed 4,139 scientific research projects, more than 200 of which reached the international level. At present, more than one-third of the students in the school are working and studying in factories, mines, and rural areas. However, this struggle has not yet been fully won, and the remnants of bourgeois school-running methods and teaching systems still hinder the in-depth implementation of the Party's education policy and the progress of the school in many aspects. This is prominently manifested in the internal structure of the school, which has not yet been well established as a joint base of teaching, production, and scientific research. Although great reforms have been made in teaching, production, and scientific research, they have not been organically combined. Although labor has been included in the teaching plan as a compulsory course for every student, some teachers and students, especially older teachers, still have many wrong views on labor in their minds. At present, the labor sites in the school are far from meeting the needs of everyone's labor. There are also many situations in the setting of majors and the development direction of majors that are not in line with the needs of national construction. For example, in radio electronics, the central nervous system of this cutting-edge technology science, Peking University only set up a specialization in the physics department, and the direction of development is not clear. Although the various courses in social sciences have eliminated some contents that obviously promoted bourgeois ideology and bourgeois culture after the reform in the previous stage, and criticized the emphasis on the past and neglect of the present, they still reflect very little on the actual situation of socialist construction in our country. After the start of school, many teachers and students in the school felt these situations. The Party committee organized several national situation education sessions, and the masses put forward the demand for continuing the revolution.

The Party Committee of Peking University has determined that this reform movement should be led by communist ideological education, further eliminate bourgeois school-running ideas, school-running methods, and teaching systems, and comprehensively build a communist university. The steps are to first carry out domestic situation and communist education among all teachers and students, then formulate plans centered on the development direction of each major, vigorously engage in cutting-edge scientific research, and reform teaching, combine this with communist labor attitude education, further run factories, arrange for everyone to participate in labor, and make the three lines of teaching, production, and scientific research twist into one rope, and reform the old rules and regulations in the school, and appropriately strengthen basic theory courses in the reform. Each step of the above reform is carried out through great airing of views, great contending, and great debates.

    北京大学提出三项奋斗目标
    加速向共产主义大学前进
    新华社10日讯　北京大学在贯彻党的“教育为无产阶级的政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”方针取得巨大成绩的基础上，根据不断革命的精神，即将在全校开展共产主义思想教育，彻底改革教学，建设教学、生产、科学研究相结合的联合基地，加速步伐把北大建成共产主义的大学。4日下午，中共北京大学党委第一书记陆平向全体教师学生职工作了动员报告。
    陆平在报告中说，共产主义的北京大学应有三个主要标帜，这次改革就按照这三个标帜来进行。第一，巩固地树立党的领导，把校、系、班级的生产、教学和科学研究全部纳入学校党委、总支和支部的领导下，并都要做到在共产主义思想指导下进行。第二，学校内部结构必须是教学、生产、科学研究的联合基地，在这里工作的教师、干部应该劳动化，在这里学习的学生，是学生也是工人，也是研究员。第三，科学水平达到国际先进水平。
    北京大学今年以来在反右斗争胜利的基础上，开展了双反、教学大辩论、勤工俭学、科学研究大跃进等运动，和资产阶级的教育方针展开了一系列的斗争，现在这个斗争已经取得了决定性的胜利：党的教育方针，不但在行动中，而且在思想上为多数师生所接受，党在学校内树立了全面领导。全校现已建立三十五个工厂。经过生产实践后，学生们共编写教学大纲一百八十四份，教材一百一十一份；完成科学研究四千一百三十九项，其中有二百多项达到国际水平。现在，全校还有三分之一以上的学生在工厂、矿山、农村边劳动边学习。但这个斗争还没有全胜，资产阶级办学方式、教学制度的残余还在不少方面阻碍着党的教育方针的深入贯彻和学校的进步。突出地表现在学校的内部机构上，目前还没有很好地建立成教学、生产、科学研究的联合基地。教学、生产、科学研究三方面工作虽然作了很大的改革，但还没有有机地结合起来。虽然劳动已列入了教学计划，作为每个学生的必修课，但有些师生、特别是老教师的思想上对劳动还存在着不少错误的看法。目前，校内的劳动场所也远不能适应全校人人劳动的需要。专业设置和专业的发展方向上，也存在着许多和国家建设需要不相适应的情况。像无线电电子学这门尖端技术科学的大脑神经中枢，北京大学只在物理系里设了一个专门化，发展方向也不明确。社会科学各个课程，经过前一阶段的改革虽然取消了一些显然是宣扬资产阶级思想和资产阶级文化的内容，对厚古薄今作了批判，但对我国的社会主义建设实际还反映得很少。对这些情况校内的不少师生在开学后，就已经感到，党委又组织了几次全国的形势教育，于是群众纷纷提出了继续革命的要求。
    中共北京大学党委会确定这次的改革运动以共产主义思想教育挂帅，进一步地破除资产阶级办学思想、办学方式和教学制度，全面地建设共产主义大学。步骤是先在全体师生中进行国内形势和共产主义的教育，然后制定以各专业发展方向为中心的和大搞尖端科学研究、教学改革的方案，结合进行共产主义劳动态度教育，进一步地举办工厂，安排人人参加劳动，使教学、生产、科学研究三条线拧成一根绳，并对学校中陈旧的规章制度进行改革，在改革中适当地加强基础理论课。以上改革的每一步都通过大鸣大放大辩论来进行。
