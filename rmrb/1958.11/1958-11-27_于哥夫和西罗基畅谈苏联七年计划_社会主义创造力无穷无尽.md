Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, November 25th: A mass meeting was held on the 24th at the Dimitrov Shipyard in Varna, Bulgaria, to welcome the Czechoslovakian Party and government delegation visiting the factory. Bulgarian Chairman of the Council of Ministers Yugov and Czechoslovakian Premier Široký spoke at the meeting. They spoke with great excitement about the recently published draft of the Soviet Union's directives for the Seven-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy.
    Yugov said: "Lenin once said that the characteristic of communists is that they have ideals and can have foresight. Indeed, what is happening in our socialist world at present is truly remarkable, and even dreaming about it is unthinkable for some people. Take a look at the figures listed in the draft of the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, they depict a glorious prospect of unprecedented leap-forward development in the Soviet Union in the next seven years. Even with the richest imagination, it is difficult to imagine the tremendous leap-forward that the Soviet Union will make in the next seven years."
    Široký said: "This document once again eloquently confirms the correctness and endless creative power of the vigorous Marxist-Leninist ideology.
    "The completion of the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan will not only enhance the power of the Soviet Union, but also further strengthen the power of the world socialist system. This will inevitably strengthen the position of peace and socialism throughout the world and greatly change the entire international situation."
    Široký also said that the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan proves that the power of socialism is developing irresistibly, and that socialism will inevitably win in the competition with the capitalist world.

    于哥夫和西罗基畅谈苏联七年计划
    社会主义创造力无穷无尽
    新华社索非亚25日电　保加利亚瓦尔纳市季米特洛夫轮船修造厂24日举行群众大会，欢迎到这个工厂参观的捷克斯洛伐克党政代表团。保加利亚部长会议主席于哥夫和捷克斯洛伐克总理西罗基在会上讲了话，他们十分兴奋地谈到了最近发表的苏联发展国民经济七年计划指示草案。
    于哥夫说：“列宁曾经说过，共产党人的特点就是有理想，能高瞻远瞩。的确，我们社会主义世界目前发生的事情确实是了不起的，而这对某些人说来，就连做梦也是想不到的。请看一看苏联发展国民经济七年计划草案中所列举的数字吧，它们描绘出了苏联在未来的七年中空前的飞跃发展的光辉前景。就是用最丰富的想象力也很难设想出苏联在今后七年中的巨大飞跃”。
    西罗基说：“这个文件再一次雄辩地证实了生气勃勃的马克思列宁主义思想的正确性和无穷无尽的创造力。
    “苏联发展国民经济七年计划的完成不仅将增强苏联的威力，而且将进一步加强世界社会主义体系的威力。这必然会加强和平和社会主义在全世界的阵地，并大大改变整个国际局势。”
    西罗基还说，苏联的七年计划证明，社会主义的力量正在不可遏止地发展，在同资本主义世界的竞赛中，社会主义必然取得胜利。
