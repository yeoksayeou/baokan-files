Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch from Tokyo: Approximately 28,000 workers, students, cultural figures, and others from Tokyo held a massive central general mobilization rally this afternoon at Hibiya Open-Air Music Hall, demanding the cancellation of the "Police Duties Law Amendment," the overthrow of the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet, and the dissolution of the Diet.

Prior to the rally, the participating masses had divided into five groups and held demonstrations.

The rally unanimously passed a resolution on crushing the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to revise the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law" (referred to as the "Police Duties Law"). The resolution pointed out that although the Kishi Nobusuke government was forced to agree to treat the "Police Duties Law" as a bill under deliberation, it has not abandoned its ambition to revive militarism and a police state. The resolution firmly stated its intention to strengthen the struggle system and fight to the end to crush the Kishi Nobusuke government's reactionary conspiracy and illegal suppression. The rally passed a resolution to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government. The resolution called on the Japanese people to further expand the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Law" into a struggle to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, in order to strive for the establishment of a peaceful and democratic government.

The rally passed a resolution demanding the dissolution of the Diet. The resolution condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's high-handed action of unilaterally extending the Diet session, and demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet dissolve the Diet and await the people's judgment on its reactionary stance on the issues of Sino-Japanese relations and the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty."

The rally also unanimously passed a resolution opposing the conclusion of the US-Japan "Joint Defense Treaty" and demanding the cancellation of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and administrative agreements. The resolution accused the Kishi Nobusuke government of attempting to revise the US-Japan "Security Treaty" into a US-Japan "Joint Defense Treaty" in order to establish the legal status of US military bases in Japan and turn Japan into a base for nuclear weapons war.

The rally unanimously passed a declaration. The declaration stated that although the united action of the Japanese people forced the Kishi Nobusuke government to treat the "Police Duties Law" as a bill under deliberation and achieved a partial and temporary victory, it is necessary to expand future united actions and, with the goals of abolishing the US-Japan "Security Treaty," opposing the "Anti-Espionage Law," realizing the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, and establishing a minimum wage system, to launch the fifth and sixth united actions, and to strive to establish a united front composed of people from all strata.

Representatives of the Japanese Socialist Party, Kato Kanju, and the Communist Party, Kameta Satomi, delivered speeches at the rally. They unanimously pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government being forced to treat the "Police Duties Law" as a bill under deliberation was only a preliminary victory for the Japanese people, and that the future struggle remains important. They called on all the Japanese people to further strengthen unity and fight to the end. (Attached image)

    要求取消“警职法修正案”  打倒岸内阁
    东京举行盛大示威
    决定争取建立由各阶层人民组成的统一战线
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：东京的工人、学生和文化界人士等约二万八千人今天下午在日比谷野外音乐堂举行声势浩大的“要求取消警职法修正案、打倒岸信介内阁、解散国会”中央总奋起大会。
    参加大会的群众在开会之前曾经分成五路举行了示威游行。
    大会一致通过关于粉碎岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”（简称“警职法”）的阴谋的决议。决议指出，岸信介政府虽然被迫答应把“警职法”做为审议未了的法案，但是它并没有放弃复活军国主义和警察国家的野心。决议坚决表示要加强斗争体制，为粉碎岸信介政府的反动阴谋和非法镇压而斗争到底。大会通过了打倒岸信介政府的决议。决议号召日本人民把反对修改“警职法”的斗争进一步扩展成为打倒岸信介内阁的争斗，以便争取建立和平的民主政府。
    大会通过要求解散国会的决议。决议谴责岸信介政府和执政的自由民主党单方面延长国会会期的横暴行动，同时要求岸信介内阁解散国会，等待人民就它在日中关系问题和修改日美“安全条约”问题上采取的反动立场进行审判。
    大会还一致通过反对缔结日美“共同防御条约”、要求取消日美“安全条约”和行政协定的决议。决议指责岸信介政府企图通过把日美“安全条约”修改成为日美“共同防御条约”，来确定在日本境内的美军基地的合法地位，使日本变成核武器战争的基地。
    大会一致通过了大会宣言。宣言表示，虽然日本全国人民的统一行动迫使岸信介政府把“警职法”作为审议未了的法案而取得部分和暂时的胜利，但是必须扩大今后的统一行动，并且以争取废除日美“安全条约”、反对“防谍法”、实现恢复日中帮交和确立最低工资制等为目标，来展开第五次、第六次的统一行动，并且争取建立由各阶层人民组成的统一战线。
    日本社会党代表加藤勘十和共产党代表裤田里见分别在大会上致词。他们一致指出，岸信介政府被迫把“警职法”作为审议未了的法案，仅仅是日本人民所取得的初步胜利，今后的斗争仍然是重要的。他们号召日本全体人民进一步加强团结，斗争到底。（附图片）
