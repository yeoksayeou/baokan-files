    Many Materials for Making Ropes
    Recently, readers have written to reflect that the supply of ropes (mainly steel cables and hemp ropes) for rope traction machines is insufficient, which affects the promotion and use of rope traction machines. We would like to introduce some substitutes for rope making and simple manufacturing methods for your reference:
    1. Bamboo Splint Rope: Split bamboo into thin bamboo splints, soak them in lime water for two or three days or boil them for three or four hours to soften them. Then, twist sixteen or seventeen bamboo splints into one strand, and combine three strands to make a rope. Bamboo splint ropes are not easy to turn into small bends, so a few feet of hemp rope should be connected at the connection of the traction plow hook. Before using it for the first time, it is best to soak it in salt water first, and keep it moist during use to extend the service life.
    2. Rice Straw Rope: It is best to use glutinous rice straw. After pounding the glutinous rice straw that has not been exposed to rain and mildew, sprinkle a little water on it, and after the water vapor penetrates into the straw, twist it into a rope. This kind of rope has poor fastness, but there are many raw materials and the cost is low. In some places in Jiangsu, pounded reed stalks and bamboo splints are mixed with rice straw to twist, and the fastness is strengthened.
    3. Banana Rhizome Stem Rope: Fresh banana rhizome stems can be peeled, dried, and twisted into ropes, which have strong tensile strength.
    4. Cotton Stalk Skin Rope: Add alkali to fresh cotton stalk skin and boil for one or two hours, take it out, wash away impurities, and dry it to make rope.
    5. Bark Rope: Mulberry bark, poplar bark, willow bark, mangrove bark, vitex bark, paulownia bark, etc. can be used to make ropes. Bark ropes are easy to rot after being soaked in water. According to farmers' experience, soaking the rope in raw pig blood first can prevent corrosion.
    6. Wild Vine Rope: Ruian in Zhejiang and Laiyang in Shandong have found several kinds of wild vines that can be used to make ropes, and the strength is also very good.
    In addition, some places use local materials such as cattails, bamboo shoots, and corn husks to make ropes, and the effect is not bad.

### 制绳索原料多

    制绳索原料多
    最近有读者来信反映绳索牵引机上的绳索（主要是钢索和麻绳）供不应求，影响到绳索牵引机的推广和使用，要求介绍一些代用品。现在选择几种制绳索的代用品和简单制法，介绍如下，供各地参考：
    1．竹篾绳：把竹子劈成薄竹篾，放在石灰水里浸二、三天或煮三、四小时，使它软熟，然后用十六、七根竹篾绞成一股，三股合绞成一根绳。竹篾绳不容易转小弯，因此在牵引犁挂钩的连接处要接上几尺麻绳。第一次使用前最好先放在盐水里浸一浸，使用时经常保持湿润，以延长使用时间。
    2．稻草绳：最好是用糯稻草。用未遭雨淋霉烂的糯稻草捶熟后稍洒一点水，待水气浸入稻草后搓成绳。这种绳牢度比较差，但原料多，成本低。江苏有的地方用捶熟的芦柴、竹篾放在稻草里混绞，牢度就加强了。
    3．蕉藕茎绳：鲜蕉藕茎剥下皮晒干即可搓绳，拉力很强。
    4．棉秆皮绳：鲜棉秆皮加碱煮一、二小时，取出洗去杂质，晒干即可制绳。
    5．树皮绳：桑树皮、杨树皮、柳树皮、红树皮、荆条皮、梧桐树皮等都可制绳索。树皮绳浸水后容易烂，据农民的经验是把绳子先放在生猪血里浸一浸，可以防腐。
    6．野藤绳：浙江瑞安和山东莱阳都找到好几种野藤可以制绳，强度也很好。
    此外，还有些地方就地取材用蒲草、笋壳、玉米皮等打绳，效果也不坏。
