This newspaper, Taiyuan, 19th. In the first year of the Great Leap Forward, farmers in various parts of Shanxi Province have fully utilized local conditions to develop diversified economic production, enriching rural products, increasing income, and improving their lives. At present, in the large-scale purchase and sale campaigns being carried out in various places, in addition to using a variety of products for self-sufficiency to improve their lives, farmers are constantly transporting abundant agricultural and sideline products to various places day and night.

This year, while Shanxi Province achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of food crops, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery production also achieved unprecedented bumper harvests. Up to now, the number of pigs raised in the province has reached more than 3.9 million, more than double the number of pigs at the beginning of this year; the number of sheep has increased to more than 7 million, and more than 80% are improved fine-wool sheep; the production of chickens, ducks, and poultry, which has been developing slowly in recent years, has rapidly risen to more than 11 million this year; the province has raised 200,000 rabbits, an increase of nine times compared with last year. Through the concentrated and contiguous development of economic forests in various places, many "Flower and Fruit Mountains" and "Fruit Valleys" have appeared in the Taihang, Taiyue, and Lüliang Mountains.

The long-standing monotonous production situation in many areas has been greatly changed. This year, with the great development of water conservancy construction in the Yanbei area, more than 2 million fish and more than 300,000 ducks are being raised in 386 reservoirs. Now some fish have grown to half a catty, and ducks generally grow to five or six catties. In many areas, a new scene has emerged where there are reservoirs in large ditches, ponds in small ditches, fruit trees planted along the ditches, and fish ponds in the ditches. Farmers happily say: The desolate frontier is better than the scenery of Jiangnan. The 110,000 mu of sugar beets planted in saline-alkali land in the province for the first year also achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with an average yield of more than 3,000 catties per mu, more than double that of last year. This not only created new wealth from abandoned cultivated land, but also promoted industrial production. This year, the province will build 500 earthen sugar factories. Shanxi Province, which has never produced sugar, will produce about 3 million catties of sugar this year. At the same time, the production of dried and fresh fruits, pepper, medicinal materials, vegetables, beekeeping, and silkworm breeding in the province has also achieved new development. Due to the great development of diversified economy, the income of the masses of farmers has also greatly increased. This year, the Huaguo People's Commune in Lingqiu County has an income of more than 65,000 yuan from fruit trees alone, with an average income of 22 yuan per commune member.

There are many mountainous areas in Shanxi Province, and the potential for developing a diversified economy is great. The leadership departments at all levels have respectively made preliminary plans for the development of a diversified economy. The number of pigs raised in the province should reach 14 million to 16 million, the number of chickens should reach 160 million, the total output of fruit should reach more than 670 million catties, and there are specific plans for other aspects as well.

At present, the people's communes in various places have shown great superiority in preparing for and developing a diversified economy. Recently, after the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee issued a mobilization order for planting walnuts, a total of more than 800,000 people were mobilized throughout the province, and 350 million walnut trees were sown in one day and night, completing nearly 90% of the province's sowing plan. The commune members happily said: "Distant mountains and deep mountains are pastoral farms, with herds of cattle and sheep filling the mountains; nearby mountains and shallow mountains are flower and fruit mountains; the plains are a boundless expanse of rice and grain; diversified economy is greatly developed, and people's lives are greatly improved."

This newspaper reports that Sichuan Province, while engaging in a large-scale movement for high yields of large-area food crops, is vigorously developing commodity production and comprehensively planning agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery and other diversified economies. The province's planting area for various economic crops next year will increase from only 8% of the cultivated land area this year to about 40% of the cultivated land area. The income from diversified economy is required to account for about 6% of the total output value of agricultural and sideline industries, and the average total output value per person will double compared with this year.

This year, Sichuan Province's agricultural production has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, and the food problem has been basically solved. The new situation puts forward a new task for agricultural production next year, which is to vigorously develop a diversified economy.

Developing a diversified economy is a revolutionary measure in the development of agricultural economy. In order to ensure the completion of the plan to vigorously develop a diversified economy, relevant departments in Sichuan Province instructed all localities to eliminate various ideological obstacles, mobilize the masses to offer suggestions and ideas, come up with ideas, and find ways to develop a diversified economy in accordance with local conditions through free airing of views and debates.

In order to strengthen the leadership of diversified management, in addition to establishing specialized leading organizations at all levels, in accordance with the principle of centralized management and regionalization of planting, professional production teams should be established in each commune to rationally arrange and use labor, so as to ensure that everything is arranged and everyone is in charge.

    抓多种经济　抓商品生产
    山西四川全面发展农林牧副渔改善人民生活
    本报太原19日电　山西省各地农民在大跃进的第一年中，充分利用当地条件发展多种经济生产，丰富了农村产品，增加了收益，并改善了生活。目前，在各地开展的大购大销运动中，农民们除了把多种产品自给改善生活外，正日夜不断地把丰硕的农副产品源源运往各地。
    今年，山西省在粮食作物空前大丰收的同时，林、牧、副、渔业等生产也都取得了空前大丰收。到目前为止，全省养猪数量已达到了三百九十多万只，超过今年年初实有猪数的一倍多；羊增加到七百多万只，而且80％以上是细毛羊改良优种；近几年来发展较慢的鸡鸭家禽生产，今年很快上升到一千一百多万只；全省养兔二十万只，比去年增加了九倍。经过各地集中连片的发展经济林，太行、太岳、吕梁等山区出现了不少“花果山”、“水果沟”。
    许多地区长期以来生产单一化的面貌大大改观。雁北地区今年随着水利建设大发展，在三百八十六个水库里，养鱼二百多万尾，养鸭三十多万只。现在有的鱼已长到半斤重，鸭子一般也长到五、六斤重。许多地区出现了大沟有水库，小沟有池塘，沟边栽果木，沟里有鱼池的新景象。农民们高兴地说：荒凉的塞上，赛过了江南风光。全省头一年在盐碱地上种植的十一万亩甜菜，也获得空前丰收，平均亩产三千斤以上，比去年提高了一倍多。这样不仅使废弃的耕地创造出了新的财富，而且也推动了工业生产。今年全省将建立五百座土糖厂，从来不出产糖的山西省，今年将产糖三百万斤左右。与此同时，全省干鲜果、花椒、药材、蔬菜、养蜂、养蚕等生产也都有了新的发展。由于多种经济的大大发展，农民群众的收入也大大增加。灵丘县花果人民公社今年全社仅果木树的收入，就达六万五千多元，每个社员平均收入二十二元。
    山西省山区较多，发展多种经济的潜力很大。各级领导部门已分别作出了发展多种经济的初步规划。全省养猪要达到一千四百万到一千六百万头，鸡达到一亿六千万只，果品生产总产量要达到六亿七千多万斤，其他方面也都有具体计划。
    目前，各地人民公社在准备和着手发展多种经济中，已显示了巨大的优越性。最近，中共山西省委、省人民委员会发出种核桃动员令后，全省总共出动了八十余万人，一昼夜即播种核桃树三亿五千万株，完成了全省播种计划的近90％。社员们高兴的说：“远山深山林牧场，牛羊成群满山岗，近山浅山花果山，平川一望米粮川，多种经济大发展，人民生活大改善”。

    本报讯　四川省在大搞大面积粮食作物高产运动的同时，大力发展商品生产，全面规划农林牧副渔等多种经济。全省明年各项经济作物栽培面积将由今年只占耕地面积8％增加到占耕地面积的40％左右。多种经济的收入要求占农副业总产值6％左右，平均每人总产值将比今年翻一番。
    今年四川省农业生产获得空前大丰收，粮食问题基本得到了解决。新的情况给明年农业生产提出必须大力发展多种经济新任务。
    发展多种经济是农业经济发展上革命性的措施，为了保证完成大力发展多种经济的计划，四川省有关部门指示各地必须通过鸣放辩论，扫除各种思想障碍，发动群众献计献策，提项目，出主意，想办法、定计划，千方百计因地制宜地发展多种经济。
    为加强多种经营的领导，各级除建立专门领导机构外，根据集中经营实行种植区域化的原则，各公社中建立专业生产队，合理安排和使用劳动力，作到件件有安排，事事有人管。
