Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 10th: Hong Kong pro-Chiang newspapers today all adopted a critical attitude towards the hypocritical "guarantees" proposed by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Parsons in his reply to some groups in Taiwan, believing that the U.S. does not act in accordance with its words and cannot be trusted.

The "Hong Kong Commercial Daily" editorial wrote that since the publication of the Chiang-Dulles talks communiqué, the relationship between the U.S. and Chiang had obviously "developed a terrible shadow." The Kuomintang newspaper indignantly said that the U.S. was "secretly carrying out 'two Chinas' activities, vaguely issuing arguments for recognizing the Chinese Communists, and colluding with the so-called 'third force' in China." The newspaper believed that with these "erroneous behaviors, it is impossible to rectify the relationship between China (Chiang) and the United States."

The "Sing Tao Daily" published an editorial entitled "The Interests of the Republic of China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) Have Been Damaged Enough," saying that Parsons' letter "repeatedly stated that it would not make any arrangements that would harm the interests of the Republic of China (Chiang Kai-shek group), which is of no help. Because in fact, the United States has caused the Republic of China (Chiang Kai-shek group) to suffer enormous and irreparable losses." The editorial said, "Repeated U.S. guarantees are useless. Unless the United States can use facts to remedy the situation and announce the cancellation of the 'China (Chiang)-U.S. Joint Statement'... If the United States cannot do this, more words are useless. Empty words are of no help, and saying more is wrong, only making the tragedy even more tragic!"

The pro-Chiang newspaper said that the blow of the Chiang-Dulles talks statement was "greater than dropping ten million atomic bombs" on the Taiwan authorities. However, in Dulles' mind, he still thought that "it is harmless to the Republic of China (Chiang Kai-shek group) and beneficial to the United States. As such, the Republic of China (Chiang Kai-shek group) has suffered losses, and the United States seems to be unaware of it, which is a terrible thing!" It said, "The United States often causes its allies to suffer great losses, and they seem indifferent." The U.S.'s "attitude often leads to irreparable mistakes, and they are still unaware of it, which is really frustrating!" The editorial said that the Chiang Kai-shek group "has been maintaining the hearts of the people for nine years with 'military counterattack against the mainland.' Abandoning this goal is undoubtedly signing one's own death warrant," "which is equivalent to suicide." Now the United States is forcing its "ally" to do this, so that the "losses suffered by the Chiang Kai-shek group are incalculable."

A "Hong Kong Commercial Daily" editorial stated that the letter "was obviously issued to eliminate Taipei's doubts about the United States, so as to prevent the relationship between China (Chiang Kai-shek group) and the United States from being eroded by these doubts." It said, "It is undeniable that the government (Chiang Kai-shek group) has already made concessions to the pressure from the United States. It can be said that it is doing its best to accommodate the United States, or it can be said that it has been subdued by the United States. Therefore, there have been very unpleasant incidents between Taipei and Washington, and this bad relationship has not yet been completely changed." The editorial believes that "what worries Taipei the most is whether the United States wants to create the 'two Chinas' issue. Ike's remarks at the press conference last week were not without suspicious points. And the gradual erosion of this kind of doubt will probably shatter the close relationship between China (Chiang) and the United States." It said, "The attitude of the United States is very contradictory," therefore, the "new guarantee" made by the United States yesterday "still needs to be tested by time."

The "Tian Wen Tai" bi-daily published a commentary today entitled "Being at the Mercy of Others is Not the Solution," saying that if the Taiwan authorities fantasize that the U.S. policy will not change, it is "excessively naive and childish." It said, "May I ask what kindness does the United States have for us? Diplomatic relations, aid, everything is based on the premise of the United States' own interests." The pro-Chiang newspaper said that the Chiang-Dulles talks communiqué had already caused the hearts of the Kuomintang people in Taiwan to "suffer a serious blow," but the "supplementary explanations" of the communiqué by the U.S. and Chiang sides "are getting worse and worse." The pro-Chiang newspaper was dissatisfied that the United States wanted the Taiwan authorities to obtain U.S. consent in everything. It said angrily, "The United States is really too concerned about its allies! It really holds too much power!"

Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Taipei News: Just as the relationship between the U.S. and Chiang is tense, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Parsons, in a letter to a group controlled by the Taiwan authorities, reassured them, saying that the U.S. "will never participate in any arrangement that would harm the rights of our ally, the Republic of China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group)." Parsons completely avoided mentioning the U.S.'s conspiracy to create "two Chinas," which it is already openly promoting.

Thirty-six groups controlled by the Taiwan authorities wrote a letter to Eisenhower on October 9, trying their best to express their "vow to oppose" "any suggestion to reduce the garrison (of Jinmen and Mazu) and 'neutralize' or 'demilitarize' them," emphasizing that this suggestion is "damaging the sovereignty of the Republic of China (Chiang Kai-shek group)." The letter from these groups also requested the United States to "end the harmful and useless Warsaw talks." This letter was shelved for a month before Parsons replied on behalf of Eisenhower. In his reply to these groups, he did not answer their specific requests mentioned above.

Parsons' letter also reiterated the statement in Eisenhower's speech on September 11 that the United States "will not retreat in the face of armed aggression." Then, Parsons added, "In the same speech, the President pointed out that an alternative way to resolve these differences is through negotiation."

### 帕森斯一封信缓和不了美蒋矛盾  香港亲蒋报纸认定美国靠不住  指出美国一切所为都是从基地主义出发

    帕森斯一封信缓和不了美蒋矛盾
    香港亲蒋报纸认定美国靠不住
    指出美国一切所为都是从基地主义出发
    新华社香港10日电　香港亲蒋报纸今天都对美国助理国务卿帮办帕森斯答复台湾一些团体的信中提出的虚伪“保证”采取批评态度，认为美国言行不符，不可信任。
    “工商日报”社论写道，自从蒋杜会谈公报发表以后，美蒋间的关系显然已“起了可怕阴影”，这家国民党报纸愤慨地说，美国“暗里做着‘两个中国’的活动，隐约地发出承认中共的论调，并做着对中国所谓‘第三势力’的勾结。”这家报纸认为，美国有了这些“错误的行为，无法使得中（蒋）美关系正确化起来”。
    “星岛日报”发表题为“中华民国（指蒋介石集团）权益已被损害够了”的社论说，帕森斯的信“一再声言不会作出任何有损于中华民国（蒋介石集团）权益的安排，极无补于事。因为事实上，美国已令中华民国（蒋介石集团）遭受庞大无比无可补偿的损失”。社论说，“美国再三提出保证已属无用。除非美国能用事实去补救，宣布取消‘中（蒋）美联合声明’。……美国如果不能做到，多说是无用的。空言无补，说多错多，徒然使悲剧变成更悲惨！”
    这家亲蒋报纸说，蒋杜会谈一纸声明的打击，比向台湾当局“投下千万颗原子弹更大”。可是，在杜勒斯心目中，还以为“对中华民国（蒋介石集团）无损，而对美国有利。似此所为，使中华民国（蒋介石集团）损了权益，美国也好像不知道，是多么可怕的事！”它说，“美国往往使盟友损失很大，而他们好像若无其事。”美国“这样的态度，往往铸成千古大错，仍懵然不知，真是令人气结！”社论说，蒋介石集团“九年来就是以‘武力反攻大陆’来维系人心的。放弃了这目标，无疑自己签写了自己的死亡书”，“就等于自杀”。今美国压迫其“盟友”出此，使蒋介石集团“所遭受的损失是无法估计的”。
    香港“成报”社论说，这封信“显然是为了消除台北对美国的疑虑而发的，以免中（蒋介石集团）美间的双方关系被这些疑虑所侵蚀”。它说，“无可讳言的，国府（蒋介石集团）对于美国的压力已有了让步了。说是对美国极力迁就也可，说是被美国所屈服，亦无不可。因此，台北与华府之间，曾引起了极不愉快，而此种恶劣关系，迄今未能完全改变”。社论认为“最令台北不安的，就是美国是否要制造‘两个中国’这一问题。上星期艾克对记者招待会所作的谈话，不无令人可疑之处。而此种疑虑之日渐侵蚀，恐将使中（蒋）美之密切关系变成粉碎了”。它说，“美国的态度，表现得非常矛盾”，因此，美国昨日再提的“新保证”，“还要受时间的考验”。
    “天文台”双日刊今天以“俯仰由人不是办法”为标题发表评论说，如果台湾当局幻想美国的政策不会改变，是“过分失之于天真幼稚”，它说，“试问美国有何厚爱于我？邦交、援助一切都是以美国利益的基地主义为前提的”。这家亲蒋报纸说，蒋杜会谈公报已使台湾国民党的人心“受了一次严重的打击”，可是，美蒋双方对这个公报的“补充说明，却愈说愈糟”。这家亲蒋报纸不满美国要台湾当局事事都得取得美国的同意。它愤愤地说，“美国对于其盟友真太关心了！真握有太多的权力了！”
    新华社10日讯　台北消息：正当美蒋关系紧张之际，美国助理国务卿帮办帕森斯在给台湾当局控制的团体的一封信里，进行安抚说，美国“决不参加会损害我们的盟国中华民国（指蒋介石集团）的权利的任何安排”。帕森斯在信里完全避而不谈美国已经在公开推行的制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    台湾当局控制的三十六个团体曾经在10月9日写信给艾森豪威尔，竭力表示“誓必反对”“任何撤减（金马）驻军以及将其‘中立化’或‘非武装化　的建议”，强调这种建议是“损害中华民国（蒋介石集团）的主权”。这些团体的信里并且要求美国“终止有害无益的华沙谈判”。这封信被搁置了一个月之久，才由帕森斯代表艾森豪威尔作答。在给这些团体的回信里，他也没有答复它们的上述具体要求。
    帕森斯的信里还重述艾森豪威尔9月11日演说里的说法，美国“决不在武装侵略面前退却”。接着，帕森斯又说，“在同一篇演说中，总统指出，解决这些分歧的替代办法就是通过谈判”。
