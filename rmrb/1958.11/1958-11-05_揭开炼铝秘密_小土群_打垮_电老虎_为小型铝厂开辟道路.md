Xinhua News Agency, 4th. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently held a National Small Aluminum Plant Construction Promotion Conference in Beijing, revealing the secrets of aluminum smelting and pointing out that the development of the aluminum industry can also fully adopt the "small, indigenous, and mass" approach.

    Aluminum production is directly related to the production of iron and steel, machinery, and the power industry. Next year, the state requires that aluminum production increase several times compared to this year. This requires the aluminum industry to catch up quickly to meet the needs of the entire industrial development. China's aluminum smelting industry is an emerging industry with a weak foundation. The meeting believes that under the current circumstances of insufficient raw materials, equipment, and technical resources in the aluminum industry, developing small-scale aluminum plants as quickly as possible is the most economical and effective way to rapidly increase the production of industrial aluminum.

    Participants at the meeting expressed great interest in the production process and construction experience of the Beijing Small Aluminum Plant during the exchange of experiences and on-site visits. The Beijing Small Aluminum Plant adopted revolutionary measures in its construction, boldly using bricks instead of steel for electrolytic cells, using earthen and wooden structures for the factory buildings, and simplifying the operating procedures, providing experience for the development of the aluminum industry towards small cities and rural areas. In the past, aluminum plants used steel for electrolytic cells, which required a lot of steel. The Beijing Small Aluminum Plant completely switched to brick cells, saving a large amount of steel, and the quality of the electrolytic cells was not affected. The plant has been operating normally for more than a month since it went into production. The use of brick and wood structures for the factory buildings also saved a large amount of reinforced concrete for building frames and energy-intensive ventilation equipment.

    The meeting believes that the biggest advantage of small-scale aluminum plants is that they solve the two most difficult problems of tight electricity and equipment supply. Aluminum plants are "electricity tigers," consuming a lot of electricity, requiring 18,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity to refine one ton of aluminum. Large aluminum plants use centralized power, and electricity is not easy to solve. Small aluminum plants can make full use of decentralized power. Generally, small aluminum plants with an annual output of 100 to 300 tons can be supplied with electricity by rural small power stations or hydroelectric power stations. The equipment for small aluminum plants does not require a large amount of steel or cement. As long as they are close to places with minerals and electricity, adapting to local conditions and using local materials, they can quickly start construction and put into production.

    The meeting also exchanged methods of producing alumina using indigenous methods created by the masses in various places.

    After finding a way for the masses to run the aluminum industry, the attendees were very excited. Many people had already planned their factory construction plans during the meeting. According to preliminary statistics, dozens of small aluminum plants across the country will be put into production by the end of the year.

    揭开炼铝秘密
    “小土群”打垮“电老虎”为小型铝厂开辟道路
    新华社4日讯　冶金工业部最近在北京举行全国小铝厂建设促进会，揭开炼铝的秘密，指出铝工业的发展也完全可以采用“小、土、群”的方法。
    铝的生产直接关系着钢铁、机械、电力工业的生产。明年国家
  要求铝的产量比今年增加数倍。这就需要铝工业迅速赶上去，以适应整个工业发展的需要。我国炼铝工业是个新兴的工业，基础薄弱。会议认为，在当前铝工业原材料、设备不足，技术力量不足的情况下，尽速发展小型铝厂，是迅速增产工业用铝的最经济最有效的办法。
    到会人员在交流经验和现场参观时，对北京小铝厂的生产过程和建设经验感到极大兴趣。北京小铝厂在建厂中采取了革命的措施，大胆地以砖代钢作电解槽，厂房土木化，简化操作流程，为铝工业向小城市和农村发展提供了经验。过去铝厂都是用钢做电解槽，这要用很多钢材。北京小铝厂全部改用砖槽，节省了大量钢材，电解槽的质量并未受到影响。这个厂投入生产一个多月以来，运转一直正常。厂房改用砖木结构，也节省了大量的钢筋水泥房架和费电很大的通风设备。
    会议认为，小型铝厂最大的好处是解决了电力、设备供应紧张两个最困难的问题。铝厂是个“电老虎”，耗电很大，炼一吨铝需用电一万八千度。大型铝厂集中用电，电力不容易解决。而小铝厂可以充分利用分散的电力，一般年产一百吨到三百吨的小铝厂，农村的小电站或水电站就可以供应电力。小铝厂的设备不需要大量的钢材、水泥，只要在靠近有矿有电的地方，因地制宜，就地取材，就很快可以开工兴建并投入生产。
    会议还交流了各地群众创造的土法生产氧化铝的方法。
    找到了群众办铝工业的方法以后，到会人员都很兴奋。许多人在会议期间就把建厂计划筹划好了。根据初步统计，到年底全国就将有几十个小铝厂投入生产。
