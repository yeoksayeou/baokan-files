    Imperialism is Begged For
    Chun Cheng
    Chairman Mao's articles consistently expounding that "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers" are of great educational significance to all oppressed people. It is a sharp weapon for all oppressed people to oppose imperialism and all reactionaries, and also a weapon for them to fight against those who have been frightened by imperialism and reactionaries.
    They frighten themselves and also use a set of principles to confuse others. They indiscriminately oppose all wars. Wars of aggression by imperialists against other countries should of course be opposed. But what about the people who are invaded rising up to resist imperialism? Just because they raised the sword of self-defense, can it be said that they are "warmongering" and "using violence"? Those who are frightened are saying exactly that. They say, "For many centuries, mankind has tried to solve their problems through violent means, and ultimately found it ineffective. Big and small wars only lead to more wars… All wars must be opposed.” Big and small wars of aggression should be opposed, but wars of self-defense and revolutionary wars must never be opposed. If people oppose any war in general, then they can only let the imperialists put their knives on their necks and wait to be beheaded. Readers will say, isn't this advocating a surrenderist policy of enduring humiliation? If you examine these people's remarks, you will confirm that such guesses are correct. They even advise people to "welcome pain", to "change our thinking habits", "don't struggle", but to "pray" to imperialism and reactionaries!
    It seems too harsh to say that they are speaking for imperialism and reactionaries, and some of them even claim to be defenders of peace. However, from the actual effect and essence, their remarks will only benefit the enemy, and are absolutely unfavorable to the people, and also unfavorable to peace. What is peace? Is it that the imperialists have developed kindness, repented of their sins, and started to eat vegetarian food? Peace is just that the imperialists have suffered defeats and dare not act rashly for a while. Only when the people unite to oppose imperialist aggression and oppression can war be stopped and peace consolidated. Fearing imperialism, showing weakness to imperialism, fearing trouble, and seeking only a peaceful life at any cost will only arouse the appetite of imperialism, making it feel that it doesn't matter to disrupt peace, and it's okay to launch aggression. In that case, where is peace?
    Furthermore, it is certainly wrong to oppose all wars regardless of whether they are just or not. Can it work to have peace no matter what the content is? Enduring the oppression of imperialism, without making a sound, without resisting, taking whatever is given, being a lamb to be slaughtered, is also a kind of peace; resolutely rising up to fight, so that the imperialists dare not talk nonsense and act rashly, is also a kind of peace. The former is just a humiliating temporary peace, while the latter is true peace. We love peace, but we do not give up on this point: if anyone offends us, we will offend them.
    But those who are frightened are precisely advising everyone to restrain themselves first, to remove "violent thoughts" "from within themselves", and to try their best not to provoke imperialism in order to avoid stimulation. To these people, Chairman Mao's words are a good remedy: "...It is impossible to hope to persuade the imperialists and Chinese reactionaries to have kindness and turn back from their evil ways. The only way is to organize forces and fight them, such as our People's Liberation War, land revolution, exposing imperialism, 'stimulating' them, overthrowing them, and sanctioning their illegal acts, 'only allowing them to behave properly, not allowing them to talk nonsense and act rashly'. Then, there is hope to deal with foreign imperialist countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit."
    These words have been proven in practice to be in accordance with objective truth. The experience of the Chinese people and the people of many countries in struggle is: imperialism is begged for; moreover, for the sake of peace, imperialism must be begged for, and imperialism must be opposed!

    帝国主义是惹得的
    春城
    毛主席历来阐述“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的文章对一切被压迫的人民都有很大教育意义。它是一切被压迫的人民反对帝国主义和一切反动派的犀利武器，也是他们向那种被帝国主义和反动派吓散了魂的人作斗争的武器。
    自己吓散了魂，还要用一套道理来迷别人的魂。他们不分青红皂白地反对一切战争。帝国主义者侵略别的国家的战争当然应该反对。但是，被侵略的人民起来抵抗帝国主义呢？难道因为他们举起了自卫的剑，就能说他们“好战”“运用暴力”吗？吓散了魂的人正是这样说的。他们说，“许多世纪以来人类企图用暴力的手段来解决他们的问题，终究发现无效。大大小小的战争只是引起了更多的战争。……必须反对一切战争。”大大小小的侵略战争是应该反对的，自卫的，革命的战争却决不能反对，人们真要是笼统地反对任何战争，那只有让帝国主义者把刀子架在自己脖子上，等待砍下来。读者要说，这不是提倡逆来顺受的投降主义吗？如果把这些人的言论检看一番，便会证实这样的猜测是不错的。他们甚至还劝人要“迎接痛苦”，要“改变我们的思想习惯”“不要斗争”，而要向帝国主义和反动派“祈求”！
    说他们是在为帝国主义和反动派说话，似乎太难听，他们有些人还自命为和平的保卫者呢。然而从实际效果和本质来看，他们的言论只会有利于敌人，是绝对不利于人民的，而且也不利于和平。和平是什么？是帝国主义发了善心，悔过知罪，吃起长斋来了吗？和平不过是帝国主义者吃了败仗，一时不敢轻举妄动而已。只有人民团结起来反对帝国主义的侵略和压迫，才能制止战争，巩固和平。害怕帝国主义，向帝国主义示弱，怕惹事，不计任何代价只图过太平日子，只会引起帝国主义食欲，使它觉得破坏和平也无所谓，发动侵略也无不可。这样，哪里还有什么和平？
    还有一层，不问是否正义，反对一切战争固然错误，不管是什么样的内容，只要和平就是，难道能行吗？忍受着帝国主义的压迫，不作声，不抵抗，予取予求，羔羊待宰，这也是一种和平；坚决起来斗争，使帝国主义者不敢乱说乱动，这也是一种和平。前者只是一种屈辱的苟安，后者才是真正的和平。我们是爱好和平的，但是我们不放弃这一条，人若犯我，我必犯人。
    但吓散了魂的人却正是劝大家首先约束自己，要“从自己内心中”除去“暴力的念头”，竭力不要惹帝国主义，借以避免刺激。对这种人，毛主席的话是一帖良药：“……希望劝说帝国主义者和中国反动派发出善心，回头是岸，是不可能的。唯一的办法是组织力量和他们斗争，例如我们的人民解放战争，土地革命，揭露帝国主义，‘刺激’他们，把他们打倒，制裁他们的犯法行为，‘只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动’。然后，才有希望在平等和互利的条件下和外国帝国主义国家打交道。”
    这些话已经在实践中证明，是符合客观的真理，中国人民和许多国家人民的斗争经验是：帝国主义是惹得的；而且，为了和平，必须惹帝国主义，必须反对帝国主义！
