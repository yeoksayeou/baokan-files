    Where Does Victory Come From
    ——Reading "Battling North and South"
    Zeng Tianjia
    Now we live in a happy socialist society. Everyone is working with incomparable joy and pleasure, united in striving to build a better and happier life. But how was victory achieved? What twists, turns, and arduous paths did it go through? Many people, especially those of us who are younger, may not understand it so clearly or experience it so deeply. As the saying goes, "Look at the present, think of the past." The past is indeed worth thinking about. Comrade Li Li's revolutionary memoir, "Battling North and South," provides us with extremely valuable material. Although he wrote only a small fragment of our revolutionary history, it vividly and concretely demonstrates the heroic and fearless revolutionary spirit of our Party and our revolutionary troops, enabling us to learn many things and understand many truths.

    "Battling North and South" describes how the 359th Brigade, led by General Wang Zhen, crossed the Yellow River and the Yangtze River to carry out activities deep behind enemy lines in the South in order to severely strike the Japanese invaders. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, they broke through the heavy encirclement of ten armies and more than a dozen security regiments of the Kuomintang army and returned to the Central Plains Liberated Area and the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an. This heroic unit fought north and south for two years, traversing 25,000 li of the motherland's mountains and rivers – this was another great "Long March."

    Fighting the many with the few, fighting the superior with the inferior, why could we achieve victory? This is a question people want to ask. We are now studying Chairman Mao's document "All reactionaries are paper tigers." This document has long answered this question, and "Battling North and South" proves these truths with concrete and vivid examples—the main factor determining the victory or defeat of a war is people, the support of the people, not weapons. Let's see what kind of people our troops are and what their relationship with the masses is like.

    On the way south, the 359th Brigade, whenever passing through a village, had thirty to fifty people automatically gather to help the troops lead the way. If a unit needed a few people, there would be that many people. And when comrades in the army were in danger, the masses risked their lives and overcame all difficulties to protect and help them. Zhang Yuting, a wounded and hospitalized soldier, was captured by the Kuomintang army. He escaped from prison and hid in the home of farmer He Yongshan. The He family had four members and could not even eat enough themselves. He Yongshan's mother, in order to prevent Zhang Yuting from going hungry, went out to beg for some food to feed Zhang Yuting. When the reactionaries came to search, they hid Zhang Yuting. When Zhang Yuting wanted to find his troops, the He family sold a load of green seedlings, and the old mother also sold two jin of cotton yarn she had spun herself to give Zhang Yuting money for the road, and sent her son to escort him all the way. There are many such touching examples in the book. This shows how much the masses loved our troops. They regarded them as protectors of the people's interests, as saviors and hope.

    The facts are indeed so. The book also has many touching descriptions of the troops' love for the masses and concern for their sufferings. When the masses had no salt to eat, the troops gave them salt. When the masses were robbed by the enemy, the troops immediately protected them. When the troops crossed the river twenty li west of Changsha, a platoon in charge of guarding was unable to cross the river and stayed on the river bank. The masses came to report that the enemy had robbed all the plowing cattle and quilts in the village, and hoped that the Eighth Route Army, the benefactors who saved their lives, would go quickly. This platoon, far away from the main force, in order to protect the people's lives and property, fought with the masses and drove away the enemy, recovering all the things the enemy had robbed.

    "The army loves the people, the people support the army, the army and the people are of one heart," such a force is invincible!

    The book also gives a thorough and deeply moving description of our troops' revolutionary optimism, the fine style of equality and intimacy between officers and soldiers, sharing weal and woe, and the soldiers' heroic and tenacious will, unafraid of all difficulties. The soldiers and commanders affectionately called their commander, General Wang Zhen, "Old Beard Wang," trusting and caring for him, while Comrade Wang Zhen and other leading comrades also cared for the soldiers with utmost concern. Once, Comrade Wang Zhen was ill, and seeing Comrade Gao Tie lying on the road severely ill, he climbed off the stretcher and wanted Comrade Gao Tie to sit on it. Comrade Gao Tie saw that Comrade Wang Zhen was also very ill and refused to sit on it no matter what. The two argued.

    "You sit on it, my illness is not serious."

    "How can that be, you are the commander!"

    "What if I'm the commander? Whoever is seriously ill should sit."

    Comrade Wang Zhen did not argue with him any further, got up and ran forward. Only then did Comrade Gao Tie sit on the stretcher. What a touching scene!

    In addition, the book also introduces us to many heroic figures, all of whom are worthy of our learning. There is the reconnaissance hero Dou Hu, the company commander Zhu Xinyang who powerfully beheaded eight Japanese soldiers, the "Li Kui" Yan Longbin of the Ninth Brigade, and Comrade Yin Guangfu, Comrade Wang Zhen's guard. In a battle in June 1945, a hand grenade landed next to Comrade Wang Zhen. Yin Guangfu, who was closely following him, stepped forward in one stride, pushed Comrade Wang Zhen to the ground with both hands, and lay on Comrade Wang Zhen's back with his own body, so that Comrade Wang Zhen was spared from danger and continued to command the battle, while he himself gloriously sacrificed.

    "Battling North and South" is a vivid revolutionary textbook. It makes us more clearly understand the hardship of the revolution, more deeply appreciate the greatness of the Party and the people's army, and at the same time, it encourages us to continue to move forward. May more such good books appear.

    胜利从何而来
    ——读“转战南北”
    曾田家
    现在我们生活在幸福的社会主义社会里，大家正以无比的欢欣和愉快在工作，万众一心为建设更加美好幸福的生活而奋斗。但是，胜利是如何取得的？它经过了一些什么曲折、艰苦的道路？许多人，尤其是我们这些年岁轻一些的人，未必了解得那么清楚，体会得那么深刻。俗话说：“看现在，想过去”。过去确是值得想一想的。李立同志写的革命回忆录“转战南北”，给我们提供了极为宝贵的材料，虽然他写的只是我们革命历史中的一个小的片段，但是它却生动而具体地表现了我们的党，我们的革命部队的英勇无畏的革命精神，使我们学到了许多东西，明白了许多道理。
    “转战南北”写的是：王震将军率领的三五九旅，为了给日寇严重打击，渡黄河，跨长江，深入南方敌后活动。日寇投降后，他们又突破国民党军队十个军和十几个保安团的重重包围，回到中原解放区和革命圣地延安。这支英雄部队转战南北，历时二年，跋涉祖国山河达两万五千里——这是又一次伟大的“万里长征”。
    以寡敌众，以劣势对优势，为什么能取得胜利？这是人们要问的问题。现在我们正在学习毛主席“论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的文件，这个问题文件早已解答，而“转战南北”则以具体生动的事例证明了这些道理——决定战争胜负的主要因素是人，是人心的向背，而不是武器。看看我们的部队是些什么样的人，他们和群众的关系是怎样的吧。
    三五九旅在南下途中，每经过一个村庄，都有三五十个群众自动集中起来帮助部队带路，一个单位需要几个人就有几个人。而在部队同志有危险的时候，群众则冒着生命危险和一切困难，予以保护和帮助。受伤住院的战士张玉庭被国民党军队抓去了，他从监狱里逃了出来，躲在农民贺永善家里，贺家有四口人，自己饭都吃不饱，贺永善的妈妈为了不让张玉庭饿着，出去向人家讨来一些食物，给张玉庭充饥。反动派来搜查的时候，他们就把张玉庭隐藏起来。当张玉庭要去找部队的时候，贺家卖了一担青苗，老妈妈并把自己亲手纺成的二斤棉纱也卖了，给张玉庭做路费，又派儿子一路送他。书中像这样动人的事例还不少。这说明群众是如何热爱我们的部队。他们把他看做人民利益的保护者，看做救星和希望。
    事实的确是如此。书中对部队爱护群众，关心群众疾苦，也有不少动人的描写。群众没盐吃，部队把盐送给他们；群众受到敌人抢劫，部队马上加以保护。部队在长沙以西二十里渡江时，担任警戒的一个排没来得及渡江，留在江岸这边。群众来报告说敌人在村里把耕牛、被子都抢光了，希望救命恩人八路军快去。这个排在远离主力部队的情况下，为了保护人民生命财产，和群众一起把敌人打跑了，把敌人抢去的东西全部夺回来了。
    “军爱民，民拥军，军民本是一条心”，这样的部队是不可战胜的！
    书中对我们部队的革命乐观主义精神，官兵平等亲密无间、患难与共的优良作风，以及战士们英勇顽强、不怕一切困难的意志，都有淋漓尽致的描写，感人至深。战士们，指挥员们亲热地把他们的司令员王震将军称为王胡子，对他信任、关心，而王震同志和其他领导同志也对战士们备极关怀。一次，王震同志病了，看见高铁同志病得厉害躺在路上，他就从担架上爬下来，要高铁同志坐上，高铁同志看见王震同志的病也很重，无论如何也不愿坐。两人争论起来了。
    “你坐上嘛，我的病不打紧。”
    “那怎么行，你是司令员呀！”
    “司令员又怎么样，谁病重就该谁坐。”
    王震同志不跟他多争了，爬起来就向前奔。高铁同志这才坐上担架，这是多么动人的场面！
    此外，书中还给我们介绍了不少的英雄人物，他们都是值得我们学习的榜样。这里有侦察英雄窦虎，有力斩鬼子八人的连长朱新阳，有九旅的“李逵”颜龙斌，有王震同志的警卫员尹光甫同志。在1945年6月的一次战斗中，一颗手榴弹落在王震同志的身旁，紧跟在他后面的尹光甫一个箭步跨上去，两手将王震同志推倒地下，用他自己的身体躺在王震同志的背上，使王震同志得免于难，继续指挥战斗，而他自己却光荣的牺牲了。
    “转战南北”是一本生动的革命教科书，它使我们更加清楚地了解革命的艰辛，更加深刻地体会到党和人民军队的伟大，同时它鼓舞我们继续前进。愿这样的好书更多的出现。
