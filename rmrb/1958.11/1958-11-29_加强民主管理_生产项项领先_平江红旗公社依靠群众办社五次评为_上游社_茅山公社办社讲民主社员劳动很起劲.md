Strengthen Democratic Management, Achieve Leading Production in Every Aspect
    Pingjiang Red Flag Commune Relies on the Masses to Run the Commune and is Awarded "Advanced Commune" Five Times
    Maoshan Commune Emphasizes Democracy in Running the Commune, and Commune Members are Very Enthusiastic in Labor
    According to a report from the New Hunan Daily, after realizing organizational militarization, action combatization, and living collectivization, the Red Flag People's Commune in Pingjiang County greatly strengthened democratic management, leading to rapid progress in production. During the winter production campaign, because it led in every aspect of production, it was awarded the county's "Advanced Commune" five times.
    After implementing the "Three-izations," the broad masses greatly strengthened their organizational discipline and greatly increased their enthusiasm for production. However, because this was a new undertaking, cadres lacked experience, and a few cadres engaged in simplistic work methods and purely adopted administrative orders.
    After discovering this problem, the commune Party committee, on the one hand, explained the purpose of the "Three-izations" and the relationship of democratic management to the commune and brigade cadres throughout the commune. On the other hand, it focused on educating them about the two different approaches and their consequences with facts. Some cadres in the Banshan Brigade, in implementing militarization, did not fully promote democracy and adopted simple administrative orders, which led to great dissatisfaction among the commune members and low production morale. This resulted in the brigade taking twenty-one days to complete the originally scheduled task of deep plowing two hundred mu within half a month, and the quality did not meet the standards, resulting in it being rated as a "Black Flag Brigade" twice. The Beiyuan Brigade, in deep plowing, adopted a method that combined centralization and democracy. It fully consulted with the masses beforehand and improved the deep plowing plow, so that the masses were well-informed. Therefore, the team completed the deep plowing task of six hundred mu, which was scheduled to be completed in half a month, five days ahead of schedule, and generally deep plowed to more than one foot and two inches, and was rated as a "Red Flag Brigade." Through the comparison of these facts, the cadres realized that they must mobilize the masses and rely on the masses in order to do everything well. At the same time, they actively carried out movements such as comparing labor, comparing compliance with discipline, and comparing democratic work styles among the cadres. On the other hand, they fully listened to the opinions of the masses in all aspects of production, life, economy, and finance, and realized democratic management. In order to fully promote democracy, the commune elected one representative from every hundred people to form a commune member representative assembly, which convened regular meetings to discuss and decide on major issues of the commune. The representative assembly had various democratic management institutions: a living welfare management committee for living matters; a technical research group for production matters in the brigade and production team; and a supervisory committee for financial matters. Each institution democratically formulated management methods, disciplines, and covenants by the masses.
    The regular visiting system is one of the commune's democratic management methods. The regular visiting system stipulates that each cadre should conduct a comprehensive visit to the commune members at the end of the month in conjunction with production to understand the four aspects of work, production, life, and thought. They should achieve "six visits," visiting the fields, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, hospitals, canteens, and commune members' homes, which has achieved very good results. For example, when visiting the second battalion of the Jiangcheng Brigade, the commune members suggested that the public canteen should store vegetables and firewood as early as possible to prepare for winter. The battalion headquarters accepted this suggestion and immediately took action, drying five kinds of dried vegetables within four days.
    Writing big-character posters and conducting free airing of views, debates has become a conscious habit of the commune members. After the Jiashan Brigade rushed to harvest oil tea seeds day and night, Li Gengyu, a member of the ninth team, re-examined ten trees and found twelve fruits. He wrote a big-character poster: "Failure to harvest carefully after a bumper harvest means throwing money away; ten oil tea trees, twelve missing fruits; it is recommended to quickly re-harvest the oil tea." The Party branch accepted his opinion and launched a re-harvesting campaign in which each tree and each plot was inspected. The re-harvested tea seeds can be used to extract more than 40,000 catties of oil.
    Because of the implementation of the combination of the "Three-izations" and "Democratic Management-ization," the work style of the cadres has greatly changed, the collective consciousness of the commune members has been greatly enhanced, and their enthusiasm for production has been high.
    According to this newspaper, after implementing the "Three-izations," the Maoshan People's Commune in Jurong County, Jiangsu Province, insisted on doing a good job in political and ideological work, promoted democracy, promoted the work style of the mass line, and further consolidated the "Three-izations" system.
    When deciding on major issues in the commune, the Maoshan People's Commune Party Committee insisted on consulting with the masses, and constantly mobilized the masses to discuss, revise, and supplement the execution, with good results. During the autumn planting, the commune initially organized large-scale operations with the battalion as the unit, with more than 1,200 people in each battalion. The number of people was too large, the team was too large, the command was not flexible, and some specific life problems were also more difficult to solve. As a result, the work efficiency was very low, and each battalion only harvested 150 mu of medium rice and cultivated 350 mu per day. In order to speed up the autumn harvest and autumn planting, the commune members suggested reducing the size of the battalion. The commune Party committee accepted the opinions of the masses and reorganized the original fourteen battalions into fifty-six battalions, with about 300 people in each battalion. As expected, the work efficiency was more than doubled, and the autumn harvest and autumn planting tasks were completed in a timely manner.
    When formulating the sideline production plan, the commune management committee initially proposed to collectively raise 12,000 pigs this winter and next spring. After handing it over to the commune members for discussion, the commune members believed that in addition to collectively raising pigs, they could also implement pig raising in canteens to improve their lives. The commune management committee revised the plan based on this opinion. Now all 59 public canteens in the commune raise pigs. When discussing life problems, the commune members suggested that in order to adapt to the needs of the temperature in each season, the canteen should supply warm water for washing faces every morning, boiling water at noon, and warm water for washing feet in the evening. The commune Party committee promptly implemented the water supply system according to the opinions of the masses, and the masses were deeply satisfied.
    After the Maoshan People's Commune Party Committee made practical decisions after collective discussion on some major issues, when some commune members had ideological resistance, they adopted the method of persuasion and education and insisted on implementing them. When implementing wheat production increase measures, the commune Party committee required that the amount of sowing per mu be 40 catties. At that time, some people could not figure it out and were unwilling to implement it. More than 1,000 mu of Sanmai sown in the Xicheng Production Brigade had a sowing amount of only more than 20 catties per mu. After this situation was discovered, the secretary of the commune Party committee in charge of agriculture immediately went to the brigade to mobilize the masses to find ways to remedy it, and persuaded the masses with specific examples of this year's dense planting and increased production of rice and low yield of sparse planting by the local people. The next day, the whole team dispatched more than 200 people, and in one and a half days, all the wheat seeds were replenished, and the amount of sowing per mu reached the standard of 40 catties.
    Because the Maoshan People's Commune promoted democracy, mobilized the masses to participate in democratic management, and implemented the working method of the mass line, it formed a new situation in which there was both a high degree of centralization and a lively and lively democratic life, and there was both strict labor discipline and individual happy mood, making the "Three-izations" system built on the basis of the masses' consciousness and become the conscious action of the masses. More than 250 commune members of the Changcheng Production Brigade lived scattered on the barren mountaintops outside the village. In order to adapt to the needs of the Three-izations and collective production, the commune members actively negotiated with each other and lived together. In less than two days, these more than 250 commune members happily moved into the village to live. The commune members proudly praised their "Three-izations" system as: "Both democratic and disciplined, unbreakable, and indestructible." (Gu Ping, Jiang Weicai)

    加强民主管理　生产项项领先
    平江红旗公社依靠群众办社五次评为“上游社”
    茅山公社办社讲民主社员劳动很起劲
    据新湖南报消息　平江县红旗人民公社在实现组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化后，又大大加强了民主管理，生产突飞猛进，冬季生产运动中，因为生产项项领先，曾五次被评为全县的“上游社”。
    这个社在实行“三化”以后，广大群众组织纪律性大大加强，生产热情大大高涨。但由于它是一件新事情，干部缺乏经验，少数干部在工作中有简单行事，单纯采取行政命令的现象。
    社党委发现这个问题后，一方面在全社社、队干部中从道理上讲清“三化”目的和民主管理化的关系外，着重以事实进行两种作法、两种结果的教育。半山中队有些干部在实行军事化中，由于没有充分发扬民主，采取了简单的行政命令办法，社员意见很大，生产情绪不高，使原定半月之内完成二百亩的深耕任务，二十一天才完成，质量也没有达到标准，两次被评为“黑旗队”；北源中队在深耕中，采取了集中与民主相结合的办法，事前充分和群众商量，改进了深耕犁，使群众心中有数，因此该队按规定应在半个月完成六百亩田的深耕任务，提前了五天完成，并普遍深耕到一尺二寸以上，被评为“红旗队”。通过这些事实对比，使干部认识必须发动群众，依靠群众，才能办好一切事情。同时在干部中积极地开展了比劳动、比遵守纪律、比民主作风等运动。另一方面，在生产、生活、经济、财务等各方面，充分倾听群众意见，实现民主管理化。为了充分发扬民主，全社每百人中选出了一个代表，成立社员代表大会，定期召开会议，讨论和决定全社重大事项。代表大会下设有各种民主管理机构：在生活上，成立了生活福利管理委员会；生产上，在大队、生产队都成立了技术研究组；财务上有监委会。各机构都由群众民主制定管理办法和纪律、公约。
    定期访问制是该社民主管理方法之一。定期访问制规定每个干部在月底结合生产全面访问一次社员，了解工作、生产、生活、思想四方面情况。做到“六到”，到田间、到幼儿园、幸福院、医院、食堂和社员家里访问，收到了很好的效果。如在访问江城大队二营时，社员对公共食堂提出及早储菜、储柴，准备过冬的意见，营部接受了这个意见，立即行动，四天内晒了五种干菜。
    写大字报开展鸣放辩论，已成为公社社员们一种自觉的习惯。甲山大队日夜抢收油茶籽后，九中队社员李更玉复查十株树，有十二个球。他写了一张大字报：“丰收不细收，现钱门外丢，十株油茶树，漏球十二个，建议对油茶，快快搞复收”。党总支接受了他的意见，开展了逐树逐块验收的复收运动。复收的茶籽，能榨四万多斤油。
    由于贯彻了“三化”与“管理民主化”相结合，干部作风有了很大的改变，社员集体主义思想大大增强，生产情绪高涨。
    本报讯　江苏省句容县茅山人民公社在实行“三化”以后，坚持做好政治思想工作，发扬民主，发扬群众路线的作风，进一步巩固了“三化”制度。
    茅山人民公社党委在决定公社内的重大问题时，坚持和群众商量，执行中又不断发动群众讨论修正和补充，效果很好。在秋种时，起初公社以营为单位组织大兵团作战，每个兵团有一千二百多人。人数过多，队伍过大，指挥不灵活，有些具体的生活问题也比较难解决。结果工效很低，每个兵团每天只收割中稻一百五十亩，耕种三百五十亩。社员们为了加快秋收秋种速度，建议把兵团划小。公社党委接受群众意见，将原来十四个兵团，改组成五十六个兵团，每个兵团三百人左右。果然提高了工效一倍以上，及时完成了秋收秋种任务。
    在制定副业生产规划时，公社管理委员会起先提出今冬明春集体养猪一万二千头。交给社员讨论后，社员认为除了集体养猪外，还可以实行食堂养猪，以改善生活。公社管理委员会根据这个意见修订了规划。现在全公社五十九个公共食堂都养了猪。在讨论生活问题时，社员们提出为了适应各季气温的需要，食堂每天早上应当供应温水洗脸，中午供应开水，晚上供应温水洗脚。公社党委及时地按照群众的意见，实行了供水制度，群众深为满意。
    茅山人民公社党委对一些重大问题经过集体讨论作出切合实际的决定后，遇到某些社员的思想抵触时，采取说服教育的方法，坚持贯彻下去。在贯彻小麦增产措施时，公社党委要求每亩播种量为四十斤，当时部分群众想不通，不愿执行。西城生产大队播种的一千多亩三麦，每亩播种量只有二十多斤。这个情况被发现后，公社党委管农业的书记马上去该队发动群众设法补救，用本地群众今年水稻密植增产和稀植产量不高的具体事例说服了群众。第二天全队出动二百多人，一天半全部补上了麦种，每亩播种量都达到四十斤的标准。
    茅山人民公社由于发扬民主，发动群众参加民主管理，贯彻了群众路线的工作方法，形成了一种既有高度的集中，又有生动活泼的民主生活，既有严格的劳动纪律，又有个人心情舒畅的新的局面，使“三化”制度建筑在群众自觉的基础上，成为群众自觉的行动。长城生产大队有二百五十多户社员分散居住在村外的荒山顶上。社员们为了适应三化和集体生产的需要，主动地互相协商并居，不到两天功夫，这二百五十多户社员都欢天喜地的迁进村内居住。这个公社的社员自豪地赞颂他们的“三化”制度是：“既有民主，又有纪律，铁打不开，棒打不散。”　　　（古平、姜韦才）
