According to a report from the Hubei Daily: From the 17th to the 23rd, the Jianli County Party Committee and government at all levels conducted a major inspection centered on rectifying and consolidating the people's communes. They comprehensively arranged for the county's members to have housing, cotton clothing, cotton quilts, and heating fuel to spend the winter, ensuring that the 670,000 people in the county could spend the winter warmly. The issue of overwintering for the county's draught cattle has also been resolved. The Hubei Provincial Party Committee recently called on all parts of the province at a telephone conference of prefectural party committee secretaries to learn from and promote Jianli County's experience, conduct thorough inspections, effectively solve problems, and consolidate people's communes.

    In this inspection, Jianli County's party committees at all levels personally took action, with secretaries taking the lead in organizing forces to conduct inspections by production brigade in each people's commune, promptly identifying and resolving problems. For example, in terms of housing, more than 9,000 buildings were found to need repair to ensure warmth during the winter. At the time, the members were immediately mobilized to repair more than 7,000 buildings, and the rest are being rushed. The shortage of cotton clothing and quilts for some people was also basically resolved by the people's communes throughout the county through measures such as speeding up cash distribution, advance payment of wages, and subsidizing households in need with public welfare funds. Currently, 84,090 people have made new cotton clothes, and 46,220 people have added new cotton quilts. The problem of some members not having prepared heating fuel for the cold winter was also basically solved through inspections, organizing the masses to dig up tree stumps and cut reeds.

    After the problem of overwintering was solved, the enthusiasm of the people throughout the county for labor became even higher. Members of the Central Camp of the Chi Ba People's Commune are launching a winter field management competition. The Lianhua Brigade of the Liuguan People's Commune has a total of 669 laborers, and all but three sick people are now working.

    In the general inspection of overwintering for draught cattle, Jianli County found that more than 9,000 of the county's 40,000 draught cattle had not been prepared for the winter. Many cattle pens were not sheltered from the wind, and the cattle's feed was not sufficiently prepared. In conjunction with the inspection, various localities launched a major debate among cadres and members on "Is it important to ensure the safe overwintering of draught cattle? Can we achieve a greater leap forward next year without draught cattle?" which raised ideological awareness and rapidly adopted various specific measures. The Longwan Brigade of the Zhubei Commune mobilized the masses to work hard for two days and nights to renovate 55 old cattle pens and build 95 new cattle pens. In addition to reserving enough rice straw as feed for draught cattle over the winter, the Bairuo Commune also arranges more than 500 auxiliary laborers to cut green grass on the island and collect artemisia in the lake every day to increase the nutrition of draught cattle. All communes have designated special personnel to feed the cattle and implement a "three-fixed, four-guarantee" responsibility system, namely, fixed fodder, fixed time to change and add bedding, and fixed feeding remuneration; guarantee weight gain, guarantee eating enough and eating well and drinking well, guarantee good rest and sleep, and guarantee no illness. Leadership is also strengthened, and regular evaluations are carried out. At present, more than 90% of the county's draught cattle have sufficient feed, the cattle pens have been basically completed, and teams have fixed special personnel to feed the cattle and established a regular evaluation and inspection system.

    时时刻刻关怀　细细致致照顾
    监利保证人民暖暖和和过严冬
    湖北省委号召学习监利经验，深入检查，切实解决问题，巩固人民公社
    据湖北日报消息　湖北省监利县各级党委和政府从17日到23日以整顿巩固人民公社为中心，开展了一次大检查，对全县社员过冬的房屋、棉衣、棉被、烤火燃料等进行了全面安排，使全县六十七万人基本上可以暖暖和和地渡过冬天。全县耕牛过冬问题也解决了。中共湖北省委最近在地委书记电话会议上，要求全省各地学习和推广监利县的经验，深入进行检查，切实解决问题，巩固人民公社。
    监利县这次由各级党委亲自动手，书记挂帅，组织力量，以各人民公社生产大队为单位进行检查，及时发现问题，及时解决。例如在房屋方面，发现有九千多栋需要修理，才能保暖过冬。当时立即发动社员修理了七千多栋，其余的正在赶修。一部分人缺少棉衣、棉被，全县各人民公社即采取抓紧现金分配、预支工资和用公益金补助困难户等办法，也基本上解决了。现在，已有八万四千零九十人做好了新棉衣，有四万六千二百二十人添了新棉被。一部分社员没有备好严冬取暖燃料，也通过检查，组织群众挖树兜，砍芦柴，基本解决。
    全县人民在过冬问题解决以后，劳动积极性更高了。尺八人民公社中心营的社员们，正在展开冬季田间管理竞赛。柳关人民公社联华大队共有劳力六百六十九人，除了三个病人没出工外，现在全部都出勤。
    监利县在耕牛过冬大检查中发现：全县四万多头耕牛中有九千多头没有作好过冬准备。有好些牛栏不避风，耕牛的饲料也没有充分准备好。各地结合检查，在干部和社员中开展了“确保耕牛安全过冬重不重要？实现明年更大跃进没有耕牛行不行？”的大辩论，提高了思想认识，迅速采取了各项具体措施。朱北公社龙塆大队发动群众两天两夜突击整好旧牛栏五十五个，新建牛栏九十五个。白螺公社除了留够稻草作耕牛过冬饲料外，每天还安排五百多个辅助劳力上洲割青草、下湖打蒿筒等精料，以增加耕牛营养。各公社都确定专人喂养，实行“三定”“四保”责任制度，即定草料、定期换铺加铺、定喂养报酬；保膘、保吃饱吃好喝好、保住好睡好、保不生病。并加强领导，定期开展评比。目前，全县90％以上耕牛备足了饲料，牛栏已基本修建完善，队队都固定了专人喂养，建立了定期评比检查制度。
