Sweep Away the Remnants of the Bourgeois Hierarchy
    Lin Wei
    The discussion on the issue of bourgeois right is underway. One of the main tasks of this discussion is to sweep away the remnants of unequal relations between people and the hierarchical concepts in people's minds.
    Some say that the characteristic of bourgeois right is not the hierarchy, but freedom and equality, only that this freedom and equality are hypocritical. This statement may be valid. However, since freedom and equality are hypocritical, unfreedom and inequality should be real. In bourgeois law, the words freedom and equality were written for the first time in history, unlike in feudal times when people were openly divided into noble and humble ranks. But the freedom and equality in the bourgeois code are not worth much, because there is a more important fact: bourgeois law stipulates that private property is sacred and inviolable. This does not eliminate but consolidate the division of people into noble and humble. Those with money are actually the noble, enjoying all kinds of privileges. Those without money are actually the humble, often unable to enjoy even the most basic human rights (food and clothing).
    In bourgeois society, the most common relationship between people is the employment relationship. Is there equality between the employee and the employer? Of course not. The employer's instructions and orders, no matter how harmful they are to society and the people, the employee can only obey, not disobey. The same inequality also exists between superiors and subordinates. The different "identities" of mental and manual laborers in the feudal era are actually completely preserved. Manual laborers are still regarded as inferior.
    In our society, land, factories, enterprises, and all means of production belong to the state and the collective. Classes have been eliminated, and the fundamental inequality between people and the distinction between noble and humble, employer and employee have also been eliminated. However, the imprint of the unequal relations of the exploitative society left in people's minds cannot be immediately wiped away. Leadership and being led, superiors and subordinates, are originally just differences in division of labor and positions, but some people mistakenly believe that they are still inequalities between people. This situation hinders the establishment of the close and intimate comradeship that should exceed any emotion in the world between communists and revolutionary comrades.
    In the relationship between cadres and the masses, there are similar situations. Cadres are originally only serving the people; but some cadres regard themselves as superiors of the people. They order the masses to do this and that, but are unwilling to listen to the opinions of the masses, let alone allow the masses to criticize their own shortcomings and errors. Some individual cadres even engage in behavior that insults the personality of the masses.
    The remnants of the unequal relations of the old society left in people's minds, or simply called hierarchical concepts, have also produced some unreasonable rules and regulations: everything emphasizes formality, everything is divided into grades, and wage treatment emphasizes lengthening the distance as much as possible, instead of trying to shorten this distance. It is said that this is not enough to stimulate people's motivation. Writing a script or a novel often pays thousands or tens of thousands of yuan, making the remuneration of mental and manual labor more and more disparate.
    Unreasonable rules and regulations, in turn, stimulate the development of hierarchical concepts. Some staff members, whose thinking was not very good, with very few communist elements and many individualist elements, became even more concerned about grades and treatment. In the grading of 1956 and several previous times, some staff members argued red-faced over their grades, feeling extremely sad, and making some agencies smoky and out of shape. The individualism and position concepts that were often criticized in the past were, in fact, legalized during the grading period.
    During the same period, hierarchical concepts and the pursuit of fame and gain also developed among the masses of society. The most obvious is the increase in the phenomenon of young students pursuing degrees and fame. The surging revolutionary enthusiasm of the early days of liberation was squeezed out by many cold and calculating personal interests. Some young people openly put forward the individualist program of being expert but not red, and being expert before being red. The same revolutionary work was divided into glorious and unglamorous, promising and unpromising, and so on. Strange and bizarre things were endless.
    During the same period, many cadres, intellectuals, and young students regarded productive labor as a daunting task. Even the laborers themselves felt that labor was a lowly and inferior thing without prospects. As long as they could get rid of production and become cadres, large or small, they felt superior and were unwilling to return to productive labor. For a time, a bad trend was formed where one could only rise but not fall, could only go up but not down, could only enter the city but not go to the countryside, and could only get rid of production but not return to production.
    In some hospitals and medical schools that have not been thoroughly reformed, nurses who have the most contact with patients have no say in medical measures. The vast majority of people are not qualified to do research work. Similar situations also exist in universities.
    The great rectification movement advocated by the Party Central Committee, especially the production and construction upsurge and the Great Leap Forward movement that followed closely after the later stage of the rectification, fiercely impacted the ideological influence of these bourgeois rights and unreasonable rules and regulations. The reason is that these things hinder the Great Leap Forward. The remaining unequal relations between people—the remnants of the hierarchy—are the biggest obstacle for leaders to approach the masses and understand their opinions. If they cannot approach the masses and listen to their opinions, of course, it is impossible to organize the masses into the movement and implement the Party's policies and the state's plans. For those who are led and the broad masses, the remaining unequal relations and hierarchical concepts will hinder them from exerting their sense of responsibility and initiative and creativity as masters. When encountering unreasonable things, they dare not or are unwilling to directly raise and insist on improving opinions, and cannot bravely fight against incorrect opinions. They will hold a passive attitude of "I will do whatever you tell me to do."
    For the sake of the Great Leap Forward, for the sake of communism, we need state functionaries, intellectuals, and young students to participate in productive labor as much as possible, to understand production in production, to lead production; to use their acquired scientific knowledge in production, and also to develop this scientific knowledge. The combination of education, science, and productive labor is the road to the development of education and science, and also the road to the development of production. Conversely, none of the three can be rapidly developed. These principles are easy to understand. However, the decadent bourgeois right ideology, hierarchical concepts, contempt for manual labor, and bureaucratic airs hinder people from participating in productive labor.
    It is obvious that without sweeping away bourgeois right ideology and unreasonable rules and regulations, the Great Leap Forward is impossible. After the great rectification movement made people see this principle clearly, many cadres automatically threw themselves into the ranks of peasants and workers, and they began to eat and live with the workers and peasants, participating in productive labor like ordinary laborers. Immediately afterwards, the ranks of intellectuals and students also embarked on this path. School teaching and scientific research work also began to be combined with industrial and agricultural production labor. Many factory workers voluntarily abolished piece-rate wages and overtime pay, and cancelled some unreasonable bonuses. Some unnecessary differences and disparities in living treatment between superiors and subordinates, cadres and the masses, were also automatically abolished in some places. People feel that only in this way can they unite more closely, accelerate the development of industrial and agricultural production and all aspects of work, accelerate the construction of socialism and transition to communism. At the same time, students also began to participate in the work of teachers and the research work of cutting-edge science that they did not dare to touch in the past, and achieved brilliant results.
    The Party Central Committee regarded the disappearance of the remnants of bourgeois right reflecting the differences between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, and mental and manual labor as one of the conditions for realizing communism and formally put it forward in documents, which greatly increased the conscious nature of the movement. The main purpose of unfolding the discussion on the issue of bourgeois right now should be to further promote the development of the movement and accelerate the elimination of the above-mentioned bourgeois right ideology and the reform of unreasonable rules and regulations.
    Through the movement, we must communize all cadres and intellectuals and become new people of communism. They can be officials or civilians, can be in the city or in the countryside, can go up or down, can get rid of production or return to production, can do mental labor or manual labor. They can make great contributions that officials and intellectuals in the old society could absolutely not make, but they are just ordinary people and ordinary laborers, do not require any privileges and special treatment, do not have any airs of bureaucrats and officials, can get along with the workers and peasants completely equally, and be good friends of the workers and peasants. This is a new type of advanced human being who has completely broken away from the primitive state and the animal state in all aspects, and they will become the backbone of building communism.
    Through the movement, we must further improve the communist consciousness of the working people and become highly conscious masters of the state and society. They have no sense of inferiority and do not allow anyone to disrespect themselves and their labor. Their labor is not for making a living or earning money, but for the happiness of the entire society and all mankind. They do not care about the gains and losses of the moment, and can selflessly help others and teach their skills and experience to others. They do not believe in any dogmas of bourgeois society and dare to engage in any in-depth research and experimental work done by experts and scholars. They dare to criticize the shortcomings and errors of leading cadres at any time and anywhere to urge them to correct them.
    Through the movement, we should thoroughly discredit things like bureaucratic airs, intellectual airs, and gentlemanly airs, thoroughly sweep away the remnants of the bourgeois hierarchy and unequal relations between people, and make all people (except for the targets of dictatorship) equal partners and close friends. This brand-new relationship between people will become the social driving force for the high-speed development of productivity. The tremendous development of productivity will finally bury the manifestation of the remnants of bourgeois right in the distribution system, so that human society will enter the communist era where each gives according to his ability and receives according to his needs, and enter the era of the true history of human society as Marx said.

    扫除资产阶级等级制的残迹
    林韦
    关于资产阶级法权问题的讨论正在进行。这个讨论的主要任务之一，是扫除人与人之间不平等关系的残迹和人们头脑中的等级观念。
    有人说资产阶级法权的特征并不是等级制，而是自由平等，只是这种自由平等有虚伪性而已。这种说法也许是可以成立的。不过，既然自由平等是虚伪的，不自由不平等就应当是真实的。在资产阶级的法律中，的确历史上第一次写了自由平等的字样，而不像封建时代那样公然把人分出尊卑贵贱的等级。但是资产阶级法典上的自由平等是值不了几文的，因为有一个更重要的事实：资产阶级法律把私有财产规定成为神圣不可侵犯的东西。这就不是消除了而是巩固了人的尊卑贵贱之分。有钱者实际上就是高贵者，享有种种特权。没钱者实际上就是卑贱者，往往连最起码的人权（温饱）也享受不到。
    在资产阶级社会里，人们相互间最普遍的一种关系是雇佣关系。在雇员和雇主之间有没有平等呢？当然没有。雇主的指示和命令，不管对社会对人民有多大的危害，雇员都只能服从，不能违抗。同样的不平等，也存在于上司和下属之间。封建时代劳心者和劳力者的不同“身份”，实际上也完全保留了下来。体力劳动者仍然被当做下等人。
    在我们的社会里，土地、工厂、企业以至所有的生产资料，都归了国家和集体。阶级消灭了，人与人之间根本上的不平等和尊卑贵贱雇主雇员的区别也随着消灭了。但是，剥削者社会的不平等关系留在人们思想意识里的烙印，还不能马上扫除干净。领导和被领导，上级和下级，本来只是分工和职务上的不同，而有些人却误认为仍然是人和人的不平等。这种情形妨碍着共产党员之间和革命同志之间建立亲密无间的应当超过人世间任何感情的那种同志的感情。
    在干部和群众的关系中，也有类似的情形。干部本来只是为人民服务的；但有一些干部却把自己看作人民的上司。他们命令群众做这做那，却不肯倾听群众的意见，更不允许群众批评自己的缺点和错误。个别的干部甚至有侮辱群众人格的行为。
    旧社会不平等关系留在人们思想意识上的残迹，或者简单地叫做等级观念，还产生了一些不合理的规章制度：处处讲正规，事事分等级，工资待遇强调要拉长距离，拉得越长越好，而不尽力去缩短这种距离。据说不如此便不足以刺激人们的上进心。写一个剧本，写一本小说，动辄付酬数千元，数万元，把脑力劳动和体力劳动的报酬弄得越来越悬殊。
    不合理的规章制度，又反转来刺激了等级观念的发展。有一些工作人员本来思想就不算好，共产主义成份很少，个人主义成份很多，这一来就更加斤斤计较等级，计较待遇。1956年和以前几次评级中，都有一些工作人员为自己的等级争得面红耳赤，伤感备至，把一部分机关闹得乌烟瘴气，不成样子。从前经常被批判的个人主义、地位观念，评级时期事实上合法化了。
    同一时期，等级观念和名利思想在社会群众中也有所发展。最明显的是青年学生追求学位、追求名利的现象增多了。解放初期汹涌澎湃的革命热情，被阴冷的个人利害的打算挤掉许多。有的青年公开提出专而不红、先专后红的个人主义纲领。同是革命工作，却被分成光荣的和不光荣的，有前途的和没前途的等等。光怪陆离，无奇不有。
    同一时期，许多的干部、知识分子、青年学生，都把生产劳动视为畏途。连劳动者本身也觉得劳动是没出息的低人一等的事情。只要能够脱离生产，大大小小当个干部，就觉得高人一等，再也不愿回到生产劳动中去。一时形成能升不能降，能上不能下，能进城不能下乡，能脱离生产不能回到生产的一股坏风气。
    有一些未经彻底改造的医院和医学院中，接触病人最多的护士对医疗措施没有发言权。研究工作则绝大多数人都没有资格做。高等学校中也有类似情形。
    党中央所倡导的伟大的整风运动，尤其是紧接着整风后期所出现的生产建设高潮和大跃进运动，猛烈地冲击了资产阶级法权的这些思想影响和不合理的规章制度。原因是这些东西妨害着大跃进。人与人之间残存的不平等关系——等级制的残余，对领导者说来，是接近群众、了解群众意见的最大障碍。不能接近群众，听取群众意见，当然也就不可能把群众组织到运动中来，实现党的政策和国家的计划。对被领导者和广大群众说来，残存的不平等关系和等级观念会妨碍他们发挥主人公的责任感和积极性、创造性。遇到不合理的事情，不敢或不肯直截了当地提出和坚持改善的意见，不能勇敢地同不正确的意见进行斗争。他们会抱着“你叫我怎办我就怎办”的被动态度。
    为着大跃进，为着共产主义，我们需要国家工作人员、知识分子和青年学生都尽可能参加生产劳动，在生产中了解生产，领导生产；在生产中运用自己学得的科学知识，同时也发展这些科学知识。教育、科学和生产劳动的结合，是教育和科学发展的道路，也是生产发展的道路。反之，三者都不可能得到迅速的发展。这些道理是很容易明白的。然而，腐朽的资产阶级法权思想，等级观念和对于体力劳动的轻视，官架子，妨碍着人们参加生产劳动。
    很明显，不扫除资产阶级法权思想和不合理的规章制度，大跃进是不可能的。伟大的整风运动使人们看清了这个道理以后，许多干部就自动投入农民和工人群众的队伍中去了，他们开始与工农群众同吃同住，像一个普通劳动者一样参加生产劳动。紧接着，知识分子和学生的队伍也纷纷走上了这条道路。学校教学和科学研究工作也都开始同工农业生产劳动结合成一体。许多工厂的工人自动起来废除了计件工资和加班费，取消了某些不合理的奖金。上级和下级、干部和群众之间生活待遇上的某些不必要的差别和悬殊现象，在若干地方也被自动废除了。人们觉得只有这样，才能更紧密地团结一致，加速发展工农业生产和各方面的事业，加速建设社会主义并向共产主义过渡。与此同时，学生们也开始参与教师的工作和以往不敢问津的尖端科学的研究工作，并且取得了辉煌的战绩。
    党中央把反映工农差别、城乡差别、脑力劳动和体力劳动差别的资产阶级法权残余的消失，当成实现共产主义的条件之一并正式在文件上提出来，大大地增加了运动的自觉性质。现在展开讨论资产阶级法权的问题，主要的目的应当就是进一步促进运动的发展，加快上述资产阶级法权思想的消灭和不合理的规章制度的改革。
    经过运动，我们要使干部和知识分子统统共产主义化，成为共产主义的新人。他们能官能民，能城能乡，能上能下，能脱离生产也能回到生产，能做脑力劳动也能做体力劳动。他们能做出旧社会的官员和知识分子所绝对做不出的伟大贡献，但又只是一个普通人和普通的劳动者，不要求任何特权和特殊待遇，没有一点老爷派头和官架子，能与工农群众完全平等地相处，做工农群众的好朋友。这是一种在一切方面都完全脱离了原始状态和动物状态的新型的高级的人类，他们将成为建设共产主义的骨干。
    经过运动，要使劳动人民的共产主义觉悟更进一步提高，成为国家和社会的高度自觉的主人。他们没有自卑感，不允许任何人不尊重自己和自己的劳动。他们的劳动不是为着糊口或挣钱，而是为着整个社会和全体人类的幸福。他们不计较一时一事的利害得失，能够无私地帮助别人，把自己的技术和经验教给别人。他们不迷信任何资产阶级社会的教条，敢于从事任何专家和学者们所做的高深的研究试验工作。对于领导干部的缺点和错误，敢于随时随地提出批评促其纠正。
    经过运动，应当把官架子、知识架子、绅士派头之类的东西彻底搞臭，把资产阶级等级制和人与人之间不平等关系的残迹彻底扫掉，使一切的人（专政对象除外）都成为平等的伙伴和亲密的朋友。这种全新的人与人之间的关系，将成为生产力高速度发展的社会动力。生产力的巨大发展，则将最后地埋葬资产阶级法权残余在分配制度方面的表现，使人类社会进入各尽所能各取所需的共产主义时代，进入马克思所说的真正人类社会的正史时代。
