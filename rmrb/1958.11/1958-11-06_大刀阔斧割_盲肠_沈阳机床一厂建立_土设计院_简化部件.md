Boldly Cutting Away "Appendixes"
Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant Establishes "Native Design Institute" to Simplify Components

(Our report) The Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant has established "Native Design Institutes" in each workshop, adopting a method combining workers, technical personnel, and leading cadres to carry out mass technical revolution, boldly cutting away the "appendixes" on machine tools, simplifying components, and doubling the output of machine tools compared to last year. This year's total output will reach 8,000 units.

After simplifying the designs of three major machine tools – the C620-1 lathe, the C630 lathe, and the C650 lathe – the plant eliminated more than 500 types and over 1,200 pieces of various components. As a result, each lathe saves at least 100 kilograms of steel and over 200 kilograms of castings, and also saves over 60 work hours, a 5% reduction from the original planned total work hours.

To support the nationwide "Marshal of Machinery" campaign, the plant's workers took the approach of "big blooming, big contending, big debating" to tap existing production potential. They discovered that simplifying machine tool structures was the best way to increase machine tool output. This is because many machine tools are designed to overemphasize versatility, with many components having limited or no use, resulting in a bloated waste. For example, the entire oil pan and coolant rod system of the three types of lathes are useless during rapid cutting and only suitable for drilling, but in actual use, even drilling is not frequent. The spindle speed of the C620-1 lathe is divorced from practical needs, so more than 30 gears are actually redundant. This type of machine tool is equipped with a structure for processing three types of threads, but besides metric threads, the module thread has very little use. A survey of 106 lathes showed that only seven were occasionally used, and the inch thread was only used in repair shops and tool workshops. In terms of工艺 (gong yi - craftsmanship, technology), there were also impractical phenomena. For example, when processing handwheel handles, purely for aesthetic purposes, a lot of work hours were wasted on electroplating and polishing. Among the 50 types of parts processed in one section alone, it was found that 31 types of parts had excessively high工艺 (gong yi - craftsmanship, technology) requirements.

Through the blooming and debating of the workers, the plant leadership affirmed that simplifying the components of工艺 (gong yi - craftsmanship, technology) machine tools was a shortcut to increasing machine tool production, and promptly put forward the slogan of "cutting away the appendixes of machine tools." They mobilized workers, technical personnel, and leading cadres to closely integrate, established workshop design institutes, and launched a machine tool revolution. Because workers personally participated in the design and extensively investigated the use of products, they were able to carry out large-scale modifications and simplifications based on actual needs. In just over a month, they completed major transformations of the structures of the three types of lathes. (Attached picture)

A six-five heavy-duty lathe, dubbed a "young master" by workers, had its spindle speed changed from twelve levels to six levels through the creation of technical personnel and workers, and used one lead screw for both thread picking and feeding, saving 22% of the parts. This lathe was simplified on the basis of unchanged performance, simple manufacturing, economical and practical. The workers and technical personnel participating in the design are conducting cutting tests, which prove to be effective and ready for mass production.

### 大刀阔斧割“盲肠”  沈阳机床一厂建立“土设计院”简化部件

    大刀阔斧割“盲肠”
    沈阳机床一厂建立“土设计院”简化部件
    本报讯　沈阳第一机床厂在各车间建立“土设计院”，采取工人、技术人员和领导干部三结合的办法，开展群众性的技术革命，大胆割除机床上的“盲肠”，简化部件，使机床的产量比去年翻了一番，今年的总产量将达到八千台。
    这个厂对三种主要车床——C620——一车床、C630车床、C650车床进行简化设计以后，共淘汰各种部件五百多种、一千二百多件。因此，每台车床最低节约一百多公斤钢材、二百多公斤铸件，并且节省了六十多个工时，这比原订总工时计划降低5％。
    为支援全国机械元帅升帐，这个厂职工群众采取大鸣大放大辩论的方法，对现有生产潜力进行了挖掘，发现简化机床结构，是提高机床产量的一条最好的途径。这是因为很多机床在设计上过于强调万能性，有不少部件用途不广或使用不上，造成肥头大耳的浪费现象。如三种车床的整个油盘、冷却棒系统，在进行快速切削时并无用处，只可用于钻孔，但在实际使用中，却连钻孔也不多。C620——一车床的转数脱离实际需要，因此有三十多个齿轮实际上是多余的。这种机床安装了加工三种螺纹的结构，但除公制螺纹外，模数螺纹用途很小，在一百零六台车床的调查中证明只有七台偶尔使用一下，英制螺纹也只是在修理车间和工具车间里才用得上。在工艺方面，也有着华而不实的现象，如加工手轮柄时，单纯为了美观，竟耗费掉许多工时进行电镀抛光。仅在一个工段加工的五十种零件中，就发现有三十一种零件工艺要求过高。
    通过职工们的鸣放辩论，厂的领导上肯定了简化工艺机床的部件是增产机床的捷径，并且及时提出“给机床割盲肠”的口号，发动工人、技术人员和领导干部密切结合，建立了车间设计院，大闹机床革命。由于工人亲自参加了设计，并且广泛调查了产品使用情况，便能根据实际需要，进行了大刀阔斧的修改、简化，在短短的一个多月内，就完成了三种车床结构的重大改造。（附图片）
    被工人称为“阔少爷”的一台六五重型车床，经过技术人员和工人的创造，把主轴转数由十二级改为六级，用一根丝杠挑扣和走刀，有22％的另件节省了。这台车床是在性能不变、制造简单、经济适用的基础上进行简化的。这是参加设计的工人和技术人员们正在进行切削试验，试验证明效果良好，准备大批生产。
