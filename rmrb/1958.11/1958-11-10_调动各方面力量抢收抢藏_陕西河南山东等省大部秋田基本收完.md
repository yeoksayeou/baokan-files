From Xi'an, November 9th: Currently, Shaanxi Province has basically completed its autumn harvest work. Among them, more than 40 million mu of autumn grain crops have been harvested more than 92%, and cotton has been harvested 80%. It is expected that all cotton can be picked up by the 10th of this month.

To accelerate the progress of the autumn harvest and improve the quality of the autumn harvest work, people's communes in various places have adopted the method of "three checks" and "three lineups" to make overall plans and preparations for the autumn harvest work. The "three checks" are to check the order of maturity of crops, to check the reform of various tools, and to check the new construction and repair of large and small roads to facilitate the passage of vehicles transporting crops. The "three lineups" are the labor lineup, dividing professional teams according to labor strength; the time lineup, stipulating tasks and setting deadlines for completion; and the lineup according to the order of maturity of autumn crops, so as to harvest as soon as a piece is ripe. In this way, the autumn harvest work is carried out quickly and well.

During this year's autumn harvest period, there were continuous autumn rains in various parts of Shaanxi Province, and it was difficult to have a sunny day. Therefore, the phenomenon of autumn grain and cotton falling on the ground occurred. At the same time, there are many novices participating in the autumn harvest this year, and most of them are surprise attacks at night. Therefore, the phenomenon of losing grain occurred in the autumn harvest in various places. In order to achieve careful harvesting and ensure that every grain returns home, various places have organized autumn harvest inspection teams and acceptance groups to inspect the harvested autumn fields. In addition, people's communes in various places have also organized grain picking teams composed of women, children, and the elderly to specifically "clean up the battlefield" following the autumn harvest army.

At present, Shaanxi Province has not yet achieved complete victory in the autumn harvest work. A lot of autumn grain is placed on the fields without being threshed, and about 20% of the cotton has not been harvested. In addition, in the deep mountainous areas of the Qinling Mountains and the mountainous areas of southern Shaanxi, some autumn grain has not yet been harvested due to the warm climate. Therefore, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to immediately launch a second autumn harvest assault movement throughout the province, carry out the autumn harvest work to the end, pick all the cotton home, and store all the autumn grain better. (Zhu Bo)

From our newspaper: Henan Province has more than 12 million laborers engaged in the intense autumn harvest. They are currently advancing at a rate of more than 880,000 mu of sweet potatoes dug up, more than 15,000 mu of peanuts, and about 50 million jin of seed cotton picked every day. As of the 6th, more than 73% of the province's sweet potatoes and peanuts have been harvested, cotton picking accounted for more than 60% of the estimated output, and tobacco leaves have been basically harvested. According to the instructions of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the autumn harvest should be completed within the recent week to achieve "fields cleared and ground clean."

Recently, various places have generally expanded their autumn harvest teams. After launching steel satellites in October, the work of mining, transportation, and smelting in many areas has been normalized, and it is possible to withdraw some labor force to switch to autumn harvesting; in agriculture, the vast majority of manpower that previously deep-plowed land and sowed wheat is now also invested in autumn harvesting due to the completion of the work. The counties also carried out a "fifteen digging" campaign, finding a large number of laborers from teachers, students, staff, family members, nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, sewing factories, processing factories, pig farms, feeders, accountants, and urban residents.

Henan's autumn harvest work is currently mainly concentrated in two aspects: cotton and sweet potatoes, with the harvest of sweet potatoes occupying the most labor. This is not only because it has increased by four to five times compared to last year, but also because the work of harvesting, processing, transporting, and storing needs to be done at the same time. Many areas have built sheds in the fields, digging sweet potatoes during the day and slicing them at night, and drying them on the spot to speed up the process. Six hundred and five slicing machines in Jixian County have been moved to the fields, with the elderly working during the day and the strong men and women working at night, slicing at night. In order to prevent weather changes, Xuchang Prefecture has adopted the method of digging cellars to store sweet potatoes on the spot. The existing cellars in the fields can store more than one-third of all sweet potatoes. Various places have universally carried out the technical innovation movement. Sixty-seven thousand slicing machines in Xinyang Prefecture have been installed with ball bearings. Xiangcheng County modified 4,000 sweet potato plows, each pulled by two livestock, which can plow 25 mu of sweet potatoes a day. In terms of cotton picking, the cotton picking teams in various places have increased many times. Except for some late cotton, most areas will start pulling cotton stalks after the 10th.

The special districts, counties, and townships jointly organized inspection teams to go deep into various places to check the quality of the autumn harvest, ensuring that "every ounce is contested, and every grain returns home." The Gongxian County inspection team brought rulers, scales, abacuses, pens, paper, and red and white flags when going to the fields. If rough harvesting was found, they would conduct on-the-spot debates, calculations, and insert white flags.

From our newspaper: People's communes in various parts of Shandong Province have launched a major autumn harvest assault, and the autumn harvest tasks centered on sweet potatoes and peanuts are about to be fully completed. By the 6th, more than 75% of the nearly 80 million mu of sweet potatoes and peanuts in the province had been harvested, and they will be completely harvested within two or three days.

Before the 20th of last month, the harvest progress in the province was slow and the quality was poor. In response to this situation, most places have launched a large-scale debate on the field with the content of whether increasing production requires careful harvesting, whether the fruits of the harvest should be discarded, and whether it is possible to harvest quickly and well with more farm work and less labor, further raising awareness. The leadership then made unified arrangements for the labor force, organizing a large army of rush harvesting including the elderly, women, and children, so that a new scene appeared in the autumn harvest work. Linyi Prefecture invested 640,000 troops in the autumn harvest, and professional teams were organized for different farm work. The young and middle-aged harvested, dug, and transported, and the semi-laborers picked up the second time, day and night, so that a new situation of harvesting, threshing, drying, and storing, as well as clean fields, clean roads, and clean fields appeared. Now the autumn crops of 9.5 million mu in the district have been basically harvested. Junan County adopted the method of large-scale operations and continuous day and night operations to completely harvest 886,000 mu of late autumn in the county.

In order to solve the shortage of labor and ensure that every grain returns home, the on-site harvesting, on-site processing, and on-site drying (including on-site threshing) created in Linyi, Laiyang and other places have played a significant role in reducing transportation labor and promoting autumn harvesting.

From the perspective of the province as a whole, the autumn harvest task has been basically completed, but some places have harvested slowly and roughly. Therefore, the relevant leading departments of the province require all localities to rationally organize the labor force, come to a three- or four-day major assault, harvest the autumn crops, and ensure that no grain is lost, no pieces are dropped, and all grains return to the barn. (Cao Xuepu)

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu: Sichuan's "Four Autumns" assault month, under the day and night struggle of more than 30 million laborers, has achieved great results. Now more than 13 million mu of late rice and more than 5.1 million mu of cotton in the province have been basically rushed to harvest, and nearly 30 million mu of sweet potatoes (ie sweet potatoes) have been mostly harvested. The province's grain purchased and stored has reached more than 60% of the plan. More than 36 million mu of land has been deeply plowed, and most of it has reached more than one foot. Rapeseed and broad beans have been basically sown.

In order to achieve fast and careful harvesting, the province universally promoted threshers, sweet potato plows, and ropeway pulley transportation. After Nanchong Prefecture improved the tools for digging and transporting sweet potatoes, it not only saved more than 50 million man-hours, but also completed the digging of more than 2.9 million mu ahead of schedule. A simple pulley created by the masses in Xichong County can slide sweet potatoes down from the top of the mountain dozens of feet high. Township organs, schools, and residents in Longchang, Jianyang, Guanghan and other places also adopted the method of digging, transporting, eating, and managing themselves, bringing their own tools to the ground in groups to dig sweet potatoes. In order to reduce the amount of littering, many places also specially organized a second echelon to clean up the battlefield to conduct a general survey of the fields that have been harvested.

While harvesting in the autumn, various places have mobilized the masses to vigorously do a good job in autumn storage. People's communes in Neijiang, Jianyang, Suining and other places have generally organized sweet potato management committees, with canteens as units, while digging, eating, and storing. The output of late rice and sweet potatoes in Banqiao Commune, Fushun County, increased 27 times compared with last year. At the beginning, the autumn storage work only relied on a few cadres and grain keepers, the progress was slow, and there was a lot of mold and rot. Later, the commune changed its methods and vigorously mobilized the masses, everyone contributed, and everyone contributed ideas. Within two days, more than 1,700 new kang stoves, sweet potato cellars, etc. were built, more than 5,000 houses were vacated, a large number of drying mats were concentrated, and 140,000 jin of firewood were donated. Methods such as drying, drying, kang, and cellaring were used to process more than 80 million jin of late rice and sweet potatoes, which were stored quickly and well. (Attached picture)

    调动各方面力量抢收抢藏
    陕西河南山东等省大部秋田基本收完
    本报西安9日电　目前，陕西省秋收工作已经基本完成。其中，四千多万亩秋粮作物，已收回92％以上，棉花已收回80％，预计在本月10日即可以把全部棉花拾完。
    各地人民公社为了加快秋收进度，提高秋收工作的质量，采用“三查”“三排队”的办法，对秋收工作做了统盘的计划和准备。“三查”是查作物的成熟期的先后，查各种工具的改革，查大小道路的新修和补修，以利运庄稼的车辆通行。“三排队”是劳力排队，按劳力强弱，划分专业队；时间排队，规定任务，限期完成；根据秋季作物成熟期先后排队，作到熟一块收一块。这样以来，使秋收工作进行的又快又好。
    今年秋收时期，陕西省各地秋雨连绵，很难有个晴天，因此，发生秋粮、棉花落地现象。同时，今年参加秋收的新手多，而且多是夜间突击，因此，各地秋收中发生丢失粮食的现象。为了做到细收细打，颗粒还家，各地组织了秋收检查团和验收组，对收过的秋田进行验收。另外，各地人民公社还组织了妇女、儿童和老人参加的拣粮队，专门随着秋收大军“打扫战场”。
    现在，陕西省的秋收工作还没有取得全部的胜利，有很多秋粮放在场上未打，还有20％左右的棉花未收到家。另外在秦岭深山区和陕南山区，由于气候温暖，有些秋粮还未收获。因此，中共陕西省委已经决定全省立即展开一个第二次秋收突击运动。把秋收工作进行到底，把棉花全部摘回家，把全部秋粮更好地存放起来。　（朱波）
    本报讯　河南省有一千二百多万劳动大军投入紧张的秋收。每天正以收刨红薯八十八万多亩、花生一万五千多亩、采摘籽棉五千万斤左右的速度前进。到6日止，全省的红薯、花生已经收刨了73％多，棉花采摘占到预计产量的60％以上，烟叶已基本上收完。根据中共河南省委的指示，最近一星期内就要达到“场光地净”，结束秋收。
    最近各地普遍扩大了秋收队伍。在10月份放过钢铁卫星后，不少地区开矿、运输、冶炼工作已经正常化，有可能抽回一部分劳力转入秋收；在农业方面，过去深翻土地、播种小麦的绝大多数人力，现在也因工作结束纷纷投入秋收。各县还开展了一个“十五挖”运动，从教师、学生、职工、家属、托儿所、幼儿园、幸福院、缝纫厂、加工厂、养猪场、饲养员、会计员、城镇居民等方面找到大批劳力。
    河南秋收工作，当前主要集中在棉花红薯两个方面，而以收红薯占用的劳力最多。这不仅由于它比去年增产了四至五倍，还因收刨、加工、运输、储存等项工作需要在同时突击做完。许多地区都在地头搭起工棚，白天刨薯，夜晚切片，就地晒干以加快速度。汲县六百零五台切片机都搬到田间，白天年老人干，晚上男女壮劳力干，昼夜突击切片。许昌专区为了防止天气变化，采取就地挖窖储薯。现有地头窖共计可以储存全部红薯的三分之一强。各地普遍开展了技术革新运动。信阳专区有六万七千部切片机安上了滚珠轴承。襄城县改制刨红薯犁四千部，每部用两个牲口拉，一天可以刨红薯二十五亩。在棉花采摘方面，各地摘棉队伍都有成倍增加，除一部分晚棉外，到10日以后大部地区便要拔花柴。
    各专区、县和乡联合组织了检查队，深入各地检查秋收质量，保证“斤两必争、颗粒还家”。巩县检查队下田时带尺、带秤、带算盘、带笔纸、带红白旗。发现收获粗糙的，就地辩论、算账、插白旗。
    本报讯　山东省各地人民公社展开秋收大突击，以地瓜、花生为中心的秋收任务即将全面告捷。到
  6日，全省近八千万亩地瓜、花生已收获75％以上，两、三天内即将全部收完。
    上月20日前，全省收获进度慢而且质量差。针对这种情况，各地大都展开了以增产要不要细收，丰收果实应不应该丢掉，农活多劳力少能不能收快收好等为内容的田头大争大辩，进一步提高了觉悟。领导上紧接着就对劳力作了统一安排，组织了包括老人、妇女、儿童参加的抢收大军，使秋收工作出现了新景象。临沂专区投入秋收六十四万大军，都分别不同农活组织了专业队。青壮年收刨、搬运，半劳力拣收二遍，日夜突击，因而出现了随收、随打、随晒、随藏和地里净、路上净、场里净的新局面。现全区九百五十万亩的秋作物已基本收完。莒南县采取大兵团作战，流水作业的日夜连战的方法，全县八十八万六千亩晚秋已全部收完。
    为了解决劳力不足，做到颗粒还家，临沂、莱阳等地创造的就地收、就地加工、就地晒（包括就地打），对减少搬运劳力和促进秋收都发挥了显著作用。
    从全省情况看，秋收任务基本完成，但有些地方收得慢，收得粗。因此省的有关领导部门要求各地合理组织劳力，来个三几天的大突击，把秋作物收完，做到一粒不丢，块块不掉，颗粒归仓。　（曹学璞）
    据新华社成都电　四川开展的  “四秋”突击月，在三千多万劳动大军的日夜奋战下，已经取得巨大成绩。现在全省一千三百多万亩晚稻和五百一十多万亩棉花已经基本抢收完毕，近三千万亩红苕（即甘薯）已大部收回。全省收购入库的粮食已达计划的60％以上。深耕土地三千六百多万亩，绝大部分达到一尺以上。油菜葫豆已基本播完。
    为了做到收快收细，全省普遍推广了打谷机、挖苕犁和索道滑车运输。南充专区改良挖运红苕的工具后，不仅节约五千多万人工，还提前挖完二百九十多万亩。西充县群众创造的一种简易滑车，能把红苕从几十丈高的山顶上滑下来。隆昌、简阳、广汉等地城镇机关、学校、居民，也采取自挖、自运、自吃、自保管的办法，成群结队自带工具下地挖苕。为了减少抛撒，许多地方还专门组织打扫战场的第二梯队，对收割过了的田野进行普查。
    在秋收的同时，各地发动群众大力搞好秋藏工作。内江、简阳、遂宁等地人民公社普遍组织红苕保管委员会，以食堂为单位边挖、边吃、边藏。富顺县版桥公社晚稻和红苕比去年增产二十七倍，开始时秋藏工作仅仅依靠少数干部和粮食保管员，进度迟缓，霉烂很多，后来公社改变方法，大力发动群众，人人出力，个个献计，两天内新修炕灶、苕窖等一千七百多处，腾出五千多间房屋，集中大批晒垫，献出十四万斤柴火，分别用晒、晾、炕、窖等办法处理了八千多万斤晚稻和红苕，藏得又快又好。（附图片）
