    Autumn winds do not blow on Great and Small Deng,
    The islands are verdant green all around;
    Red flowers bloom on the green trees,
    Pick the red flowers and send them to the heroes.

    During my days on Great and Small Deng, such verses echoed in my heart every day. Some say that Great and Small Deng suffered the most shelling, destroying many villages. But on these two islands, I heard more heroic stories than I saw shell craters.

    On Great and Small Deng, you can't tell where the front line is and where the rear is, you can't distinguish between soldiers and civilians, because everywhere is a position, everyone lives in dugouts, and everyone is participating in the war. When the shelling is intense, if you go to the artillery positions, you will find among the artillerymen many militiamen in civilian clothes and women in colorful clothes. They are not just carrying stretchers to rescue the wounded, but also moving shells, wiping shells, setting fuses, loading, and even firing the guns. These many "artillerymen" without uniforms have learned all the artillery techniques except for aiming. On Great and Small Deng Islands, who among the people, except for a few-year-old children, has not heard more artillery fire than the soldiers? Many children were born amidst the booming cannons, and many young people grew up under the artillery fire.

    When this round of artillery battle began, the people of Great and Small Deng put forward the slogan "The troops shall have whatever they need." To build fortifications for the artillery, they dismantled houses, courtyards, pigsties, toilets, and stone threshing floors, and offered wood and stone. Zhang Anzhen from Yangtang Village donated all the wood he had prepared for nine years to build a new house. He said, "When Kinmen and Taiwan are recovered, what kind of houses won't we have?" Zheng Dang, an old lady in her sixties from Shuanglu Village, donated a stone mill, saying, "I am old, my grandson is young, and my daughter-in-law's eyes are going blind, so we can't participate in supporting the front. Let this stone mill do something for us!"

    Every night, you see, the islands are like boiling pots, with thousands of male and female laborers busy moving shells, transporting wood and stone, digging trenches, and building fortifications. ... Old Granny Wang Li, in her fifties, worked all night with the young people to build fortifications, and eight-year-old Xu Lulian also used his small hands to carry wood. Li Aihua from Dadeng Township organized an Ironclad Assault Team, which worked even harder than the men. One night, Li Aihua fell into a water pit while carrying a stone, and her clothes and hair were all wet. Others advised her to go home, but she said, "It doesn't matter if we suffer a little to eliminate the enemy." She persisted until dawn.

    Zhang Jiucai, the female township head of Dadeng Township, organized a laundry team of two hundred and seventy-two women, who braved the artillery fire every day to collect dirty clothes from the various positions to wash. Once, she saw on the gun emplacements that the artillerymen's shell-wiping cloths were too greasy, and the soldiers were tearing off their own clothes to wipe them. She immediately called on everyone to wash the gun cloths. When the grease was too thick to wash off, she thought of using a large pot for cooking oysters and adding alkali to boil them, washing a large pile of gun cloths clean.

    Hong Xiucong, the female township head of Xiaodeng Township, led the women several times to jump into the sea, which was up to their chests, to rescue wood that had drifted away and to transport shells from the mainland. During the battle, she even ran to the gun emplacements and fired two shots at Greater Kinmen.

    The men of Great and Small Deng are mostly fishermen and boatmen, and they shoulder the important task of wartime transportation. Some formed stretcher teams and labor teams. They rescued the wounded in the artillery fire and transported ammunition to the artillerymen. Forty-four militiamen even directly participated in the artillery battle. The militiamen of Xiaodeng also came up with many ingenious methods to carry out political offensives against the Chiang troops. They released more than two hundred kites, carrying more than forty thousand leaflets and safety passes, scattering them on the Chiang troops' positions. Not long ago, they used small boats to send large wooden placards with propaganda to the waters off Greater Kinmen. Each placard had a large character written on it, reading "Oppose American Imperialism's Occupation of Taiwan." This kind of large slogan, erected on the sea opposite the enemy's position, is more powerful than twenty eight-inch guns. It has a powerful force, and it is also like a mother's hand, calling the son who has fallen into the mud pit to return. (Late October in Xiamen)

    在大小登岛
    白双
    秋风不吹大小登，
    海岛遍地绿葱葱；
    绿树上面开红花，
    红花摘来送英雄。
    在大小登的日子，我心中天天跳动着这样的诗句。有人说，大小登落下的炮弹最多，打毁了不少村庄。可是我在这两个岛上，听见的英雄故事，比看到的弹坑还多。
    在大小登，你看不出哪是前线哪是后方，你分不清谁是战士谁是老百姓，因为到处都是阵地，住的都是地洞，人人都在参战。在炮火激烈的时候，假如你到炮阵地，你会发现炮兵当中，有许多穿便衣的民兵和穿花衣裳的妇女，他们不只在抬担架救护伤员，而且在搬送炮弹，擦炮弹，上信管，装填，以至开炮。这许多不穿军服的男女“炮兵”，除了不会瞄准以外，炮兵的技术统通学会了。在大小登岛上，除了几岁的孩子以外，哪个人听的炮声不比战士们多啊？许多儿童是在炮声隆隆中诞生的，许多青年是在炮火下面长大的。
    这回炮战开始，大小登人民，提出“部队要什么有什么”的口号。他们为了给炮兵修工事，拆掉房屋、院墙、猪圈、厕所和石埕，献出木料和石料。阳塘村有个张安镇，他把准备九年要盖新房的木料都献出来了。他说：“金门台湾收复了，要盖什么房子没有啊？”双泸村六十多岁的老太太郑当，献出一个石磨说：“我老了，孙儿年幼，媳妇眼睛要瞎，都不能参加支前，就让这个石磨，替我们出点力吧！”
    每天夜里，你看吧，海岛上像开了锅一样，成千的男女民工，忙着搬炮弹、运木石、挖战壕、修工事。……五十多岁的王立老大娘，整夜和年青人一起修工事，八岁的孩子许路廉，也用小手去抬木头。大登乡李爱花组织个铁甲突击队，比男人们干的还欢。有天夜里，李爱花扛石头跌进水坑，衣服头发全湿了，别人劝她回家，她说：“为了消灭敌人，苦一点不算什么。”一直坚持到天亮。
    大登乡的女乡长张韭菜，组织了两百七十二个妇女的洗衣队，每天冒着炮火，到各阵地上收脏衣服来洗。有次她在炮床上，看见炮兵们的擦炮弹布太油了，战士们撕掉自己的衣服去擦。她马上号召大家洗炮布，油腻太厚洗不掉，她想法子用煮蠔的大锅加上碱去煮，把一大堆炮布，洗的干干净净。
    小登乡的女乡长洪秀丛，几次带动妇女们，跳下没到胸前的海中，抢救被海水漂出去的木料，搬运从大陆来的炮弹。在战斗中，她还跑到炮床里，朝大金门开了两炮。
    大小登的男人们，多半是渔民和船工，他们担负着战时交通运输的重要任务。有一部分组成担架队和民工队。他们在炮火中抢救伤员，为炮兵们输送弹药，有四十四个民兵，还直接的参加炮战。小登的民兵们，还想出许多妙法，向蒋军进行政治攻势，他们一共放出二百多个风筝，带着四万多份宣传品和安全证，散到蒋军的阵地上。前不久，他们用小船把宣传的大木牌，送到大金门的海面。每个木牌一个大字，写着“反对美帝霸占台湾”。这种大标语，竖立在敌人阵地对面的海上，比二十门八英寸的大炮还有力，它有一股强大的力量，它也像母亲的手，在召唤陷入泥坑的儿子归来。　（10月底于厦门）
