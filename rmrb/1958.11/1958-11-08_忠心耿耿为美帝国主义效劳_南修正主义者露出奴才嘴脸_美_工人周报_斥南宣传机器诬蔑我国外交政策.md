Xinhua News Agency, November 7th: The American "Worker's Weekly" published an article on November 2nd entitled "Yugoslav Revisionism and the Far East Crisis," denouncing the Yugoslav revisionists' slander of China's foreign policy and their service to American imperialism.

The article exposed the shameful role played by the Yugoslav revisionists at a time when American imperialists were intensifying the creation of tension in the Far East. The "Worker's Weekly" cited an article published in the Belgrade "International Politics" magazine on September 16, slandering China's foreign policy, to illustrate how the Yugoslav revisionists serve American imperialists.

The author of the "International Politics" magazine article was Teslic, an international affairs commentator for the Yugoslav "Combat News." In an article entitled "China's Foreign Policy," he shamelessly slandered and viciously attacked the People's Republic of China for "abandoning" the Bandung Principles and choosing a policy of "bloc alliance." The "Worker's Weekly" article stated: Teslic used 99% of the space in his twenty-two paragraph article to attack the People's Republic of China.

The "Worker's Weekly" said: "This statement is consistent with the program announced at the Seventh Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party, which rejected the Marxist-Leninist concept that imperialism is the trend of war and the root of danger, and adopted the concept that danger comes equally from two major blocs, one capitalist and the other socialist." The "Worker's Weekly" pointed out, however, that in fact, the Yugoslav Communist Party program "directs its main force of accusation against the Soviet Union."

The "Worker's Weekly" said that although Teslic reiterated the "two blocs" line in his article, it can be seen very clearly that he attempted to push the responsibility for this crisis onto the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

The "Worker's Weekly" article concluded that this is the true color of revisionism: "At a time when the danger is very serious—when the whole world is standing on the most dangerous edge of all of Dulles' edges—this so-called pure, realistic, and modern socialist stands to the right of the British Labour Party, to the right of former Member of Parliament Lehman, and to the right of former (American) Secretary of State Acheson."

### 忠心耿耿为美帝国主义效劳  南修正主义者露出奴才嘴脸  美“工人周报”斥南宣传机器诬蔑我国外交政策

    忠心耿耿为美帝国主义效劳
    南修正主义者露出奴才嘴脸
    美“工人周报”斥南宣传机器诬蔑我国外交政策
    新华社7日讯　美国“工人周报”11月2日刊载了一篇题为“南斯拉夫修正主义和远东危机”的文章，斥责南斯拉夫修正主义者对中国外交政策的诬蔑和为美帝国主义效劳。
    这篇文章揭露了南斯拉夫修正主义者在美帝国主义者正在加紧制造远东紧张局势的时候所扮演的可耻角色。“工人周报”举出贝尔格莱德9月16日出版的“国际政治”杂志的一篇污蔑中国外交政策的文章，来说明南斯拉夫修正主义者如何为美帝国主义者效劳。
    “国际政治”杂志的文章作者是南斯拉夫“战斗报”的国际问题评论员特斯利奇。他在一篇题为“中国的外交政策”的文章中极为无耻诬蔑和恶毒地攻击中华人民共和国“放弃”万隆原则，选择了“集团联盟”政策。“工人周报”的文章说：特斯利奇在长达二十二段的文章中用99％的篇幅来攻击中华人民共和国。
    “工人周报”说：“这个说法是同南共第七次代表大会所宣布的纲领一致的，这个纲领拒绝了关于帝国主义是战争趋势和危险根源这一马克思列宁主义的概念，而采纳了这样的概念，即认为危险同样来自两个大国集团，这两个集团一个是资本主义集团，另一个是社会主义集团。”“工人周报”指出，但是事实上，南共纲领把它的“控告的主要力量针对着苏联”。
    “工人周报”说，特斯利奇在他的文章里虽然重申了“两个集团”的路线，但是可以十分清楚地看出，他企图把这次危机的责任推到苏联和中华人民共和国身上。
    “工人周报”的文章最后说，这就是修正主义的本色，“在危险很严重的时候——当全世界站在杜勒斯的所有边缘中最危险的边缘上的时候，这位所谓纯粹的、现实的、现代的社会主义者却站在英国工党的右边，站在前议员莱曼和前（美国）国务卿艾奇逊的右边”。
