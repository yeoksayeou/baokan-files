The "Five Flowers" Girls Create a Miracle: One Ram Inseminates 20,000 Sheep

(Reported by this newspaper) The Five Flowers Insemination Station of the Xiaohaizi People's Commune in Shangdu County, Hebei Province, composed of five young girls with an average age of less than seventeen, used one Soviet Caucasian stud ram and artificial insemination to breed 21,254 ewes in 125 days, with a conception rate of 99.2%, exceeding last year's world record for the highest number of ewes inseminated by one stud ram by 25%.

This insemination station was established in June of this year. All five staff members—Li Junhua, Li Cuihua, Li Xiuhua, Li Guihua, and Ma Chahua—were named the "Five Flowers" Insemination Station because their names all end with the character "flower." The oldest of the five is eighteen years old, and the youngest is fifteen; two of them have completed higher primary school education, and the rest only have lower primary school education.

Under the care and education of the Party, they overcame the heavy obstacles of feudal ideology in a short period of time and strengthened their determination to do a good job in insemination. In their work, they studied diligently, boldly innovated technology, strictly paid attention to strengthening the feeding and management of stud rams, continuously improved semen collection and insemination techniques, increased semen dilution multiples, and adopted methods such as artificial estrus induction to accelerate the insemination speed and improve the utilization rate of stud rams.

They not only worked hard to complete the insemination tasks of their own commune but also frequently climbed mountains and crossed ridges to help eight people's communes throughout the county complete the insemination tasks of 15,600 ewes.

    “五花”姑娘创奇迹  一头公羊配种两万只
    本报讯　由五名平均年龄还不到十七岁的年轻姑娘组成的河北省商都县小海子人民公社五花配种站，用一头苏联高加索种公羊，采用人工授精的办法，在一百二十五天中配了两万一千二百五十四只母羊，受胎率达到了99.2％，超过去年世界一头种公羊配种最高纪录的25％。
    这个配种站是今年6月建立的。全站五名工作人员——李俊花、李翠花、李秀花、李桂花、马茶花，因为她们的名字末尾都是花字，所以命名为“五花”配种站。她们五人中最大的十八岁，最小的十五岁；其中两人是高小文化程度，其余的只有初小文化程度。
    她们在党的关怀和教育下，在短短的时间里，冲破了封建思想的重重阻碍，坚定了做好配种工作的决心。在工作中勤学苦钻，大胆革新技术，严格注意加强对种公羊的饲养管理，不断提高采精、输精技术，增加精液稀释倍数，以及采取人工催情等办法，加快配种速度，提高种公羊的利用率。
    她们不仅努力完成本社的配种任务，还经常爬山越岭，去帮助全县八个人民公社完成了一万五千六百头母羊的配种任务。
