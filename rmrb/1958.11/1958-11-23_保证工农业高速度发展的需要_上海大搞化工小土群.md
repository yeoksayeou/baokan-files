To Guarantee the Needs of High-Speed Development of Industry and Agriculture
Shanghai Vigorously Develops Small-Scale, Indigenous Chemical Industries

(Our Newspaper Shanghai, November 22nd Dispatch) Under the impetus and influence of the mass movement for iron and steel and the machinery industry, Shanghai's chemical industry department has recently launched a mass movement to produce various chemical raw materials using indigenous methods, demanding that, under the guidance of the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" and integrating large, medium, and small enterprises, they strive to ensure that the production of chemical raw materials next year keeps up with the needs of the iron and steel and machinery industries' continued leap forward.

The great leap forward in iron and steel, the machinery industry, and agriculture has placed many new demands on Shanghai's chemical industry. The supply of many chemicals, especially eight chemical raw materials needed for the development of the iron and steel industry, such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, soda ash, and ammonium nitrate, is very tight in the market, and production is far from meeting the needs. After discussion and research, the Municipal Chemical Industry Bureau believes that without the cooperation of small-scale, indigenous groups, it will be difficult for chemical products to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production development this year and next year, based on the equipment capacity of existing enterprises and the new equipment capacity put into production this year and next year. To this end, it is proposed to establish 600 sets of small-scale, indigenous chemical equipment before the end of the year to vigorously increase the production of fourteen important chemical raw materials such as sulfuric acid and soda ash. After this task was deployed at the factory director meeting held in early September, the factory workers immediately launched a movement to build indigenous equipment on a large scale.

The first difficulty encountered in building small-scale, indigenous chemical plants is the problem of equipment materials. For example, to build 150 sets of indigenous sulfuric acid production equipment, it is necessary to build more than 1,000 acid-resistant towers, which require tens of thousands of acid-resistant ceramic jars and millions of ceramic rings to be filled in the towers. It is difficult to solve these materials for a while, so the workers are looking for substitutes everywhere to complete this task.

So far, the factories under the Shanghai Municipal Chemical Industry Bureau have built 150 sets of indigenous equipment for the production of sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, soda ash, caustic soda, and other chemicals, and 192 sets are under construction. Among the indigenous equipment that has been built or is under construction, there are 61 sets of equipment for manufacturing sulfuric acid, which can increase the production of nearly 10,000 tons of sulfuric acid annually after all are put into production.

### 保证工农业高速度发展的需要  上海大搞化工小土群

    保证工农业高速度发展的需要
    上海大搞化工小土群
    本报上海22日电　在钢铁和机械工业大搞群众运动的推动和影响下，上海化学工业部门最近也展开了一个用土法生产各种化工原料的群众运动，要求在“土洋并举”、大中小相结合的方针指导下，力争明年化工原料的生产赶上钢铁、机械工业再跃进的需要。
    钢铁、机械工业和农业大跃进，对上海化学工业提出了许多新的要求。许多化学品特别是钢铁工业发展需要的硫酸、硝酸、纯碱、硝铵等八种化工原料，市上供应十分紧张，生产远远赶不上需要。市化学工业局经过讨论研究后，认为根据现有企业的设备能力以及今年和明年投入生产的新设备能力，没有小土群的配合，今年和明年化学品都难以满足工农业生产发展需要。为此提出在年底前建立六百套小型土法化工设备，大力增产硫酸、纯碱等十四种重要的化工原料。这个任务在9月初召开的厂长会议上布置以后，各厂职工就立即开展了一个大造土设备的运动。
    建设小型土化工厂，首先碰到的困难是设备材料问题。例如搞一百五十套土法生产硫酸设备，就需要建立一千多座耐酸塔，这些塔要上万只耐酸陶缸和上百万只填在塔内的瓷环。这些材料一时很难解决，职工们就各处去寻找代用品来完成这项工作。
    到目前为止，上海市化学工业局所属各厂已经建成一百五十套生产硫酸、硝酸、盐酸、纯碱、烧碱和其他化学品的土设备，正在建设的还有一百九十二套。已建成或正在建设的土设备中，制造硫酸的设备有六十一套，全部投入生产后每年就能增产硫酸近万吨。
