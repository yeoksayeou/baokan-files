    Mourning Chairman Georgi Damyanov
    Comrade Georgi Damyanov, a prominent leader of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the People's Republic of Bulgaria, a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and Chairman of the Presidium of the National Assembly of Bulgaria, unfortunately passed away the day before yesterday due to a prolonged serious illness. The Chinese people are immensely saddened by this news. With extremely heavy hearts, we extend our deepest condolences to the fraternal Bulgarian people!
    Comrade G. Damyanov was a veteran fighter of the Bulgarian Communist Party, a loyal student and comrade-in-arms of Dimitrov, and an active participant in the international workers' movement and the communist movement. He gloriously dedicated his life to the cause of Bulgaria's independence, freedom, and socialism, and to the cause of the working class in all countries striving for liberation. Comrade G. Damyanov joined the Bulgarian Communist Party early in his life. As an outstanding communist, he waged tireless struggles for the revolutionary cause of his motherland. He was one of the leaders of the famous September Uprising of 1923 by the Bulgarian people against the fascist government. Before the liberation of Bulgaria, he also led the Party's underground activities with remarkable success and participated in the work of the Communist International. After the liberation of Bulgaria in 1944, he devoted all his energy to the construction of the People's Republic and its armed forces, and to the unity of the people throughout the country. Comrade G. Damyanov, with his lifelong loyalty to serving the Party and the people, and his lofty spirit of striving for peace, democracy, and socialism, won the love of the Bulgarian people and the respect of peace-loving people of all countries. The passing of Comrade G. Damyanov is not only a great loss for the Bulgarian people, but also a common loss for peace-loving people of all countries.
    Currently, Bulgaria is in an era of vigorous development. In the fourteen years since liberation, the Bulgarian people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have transformed a backward agricultural country into a developed socialist country with both industry and agriculture. Bulgaria's industrial production has exceeded seven times that of 1939; the socialist transformation of agriculture is also nearing completion; and the people's living standards are constantly improving. At present, the Bulgarian people are responding to the Party's call and striving to complete the Third Five-Year Plan (1958-1962) three or four years ahead of schedule. The brilliant achievements made by the Bulgarian people in socialist construction are the result of the wise leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the hard work of the entire Bulgarian people, and are also inseparable from Comrade G. Damyanov's dedication to the revolutionary and socialist cause of the motherland.
    Now, Comrade G. Damyanov has bid farewell to us forever! But his spirit of courageous struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism will forever inspire us to move forward. We must commemorate Comrade G. Damyanov, a close friend of the Chinese people, by continuously strengthening the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian peoples, and by continuously strengthening the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    哀悼格·达米扬诺夫主席
    保加利亚共产党和保加利亚人民共和国的著名领导人——保共中央政治局委员、保加利亚国民议会主席团主席格奥尔基·达米扬诺夫同志，由于长期重病，不幸于前日逝世。消息传来，中国人民无比悲痛。我们以极其沉重的心情，谨向兄弟般的保加利亚人民表示深切的哀悼！
    格·达米扬诺夫同志是保加利亚共产党久经考验的老战士，是季米特洛夫的忠实学生和战友，是国际工人运动和共产主义运动的积极活动家。他为保加利亚的独立、自由和社会主义事业，为各国工人阶级争取解放的事业，光荣地贡献了自己的一生。格·达米扬诺夫同志早年即参加了保加利亚共产党，作为一个优秀的共产党员，他为祖国的革命事业进行了不懈的斗争。他是1923年保加利亚人民反对法西斯政府的著名的九月起义的领导者之一。在保加利亚解放以前，他还卓著成效地领导了党的秘密活动和参加了共产国际的工作。1944年保加利亚解放以后，他又为人民共和国及其武装部队的建设，为全国人民的团结，贡献了自己的全部精力。格·达米扬诺夫同志以其一生忠诚地为党为人民服务，为和平、民主和社会主义事业奋斗的崇高精神，获得了保加利亚人民的热爱，获得了爱好和平的各国人民的崇敬。格·达米扬诺夫同志的逝世，不仅是保加利亚人民的重大损失，而且也是爱好和平的各国人民的共同损失。
    目前，保加利亚正处在一个蓬勃发展的时代。解放后的十四年间，保加利亚人民在共产党的领导下，已经把一个落后的农业国家建设成为一个工农业发达的社会主义国家了。保加利亚的工业生产已超过1939年的七倍以上；农业社会主义改造也即将全部完成；人民生活不断提高。目前，保加利亚人民正在响应党的号召，争取在三、四年内提前完成第三个五年计划（1958—1962年）。保加利亚人民在社会主义建设中所取得的辉煌成就，是保加利亚共产党英明领导和保加利亚全体人民努力奋斗的结果，也是同格·达米扬诺夫同志为祖国革命和社会主义事业献身分不开的。
    现在，格·达米扬诺夫同志同我们永别了！可是他为和平、民主和社会主义事业英勇奋斗的精神将永远鼓舞着我们前进。我们要以不断加强中保两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊，以不断加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结，来纪念中国人民亲密的朋友格·达米扬诺夫同志。
