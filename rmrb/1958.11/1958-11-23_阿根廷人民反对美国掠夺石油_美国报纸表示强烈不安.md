Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 22nd: An article published yesterday in "U.S. News & World Report" indicates that the United States is very uneasy about the strong opposition of the Argentine people to allowing the U.S. to control Argentina's oil resources.

The article is titled: "Turmoil in Argentina, New Disputes Upset the U.S. at Home." The article states, "What is involved in Argentina's recent crisis is very important. The future of U.S. billion-dollar investments is in question."

Not long ago, the Frondizi government signed contracts with U.S. oil monopoly capital, allowing U.S. companies to invest one billion dollars in Argentina's oil industry. It is reported that due to opposition from Argentine oil workers and the people nationwide, the Argentine government has announced a temporary halt to the official signing of the contracts.

In order to further promote the policy of economic plunder in Argentina, this article blatantly attempts to instruct the Argentine government to suppress the Communist Party and the labor movement. The article avoids mentioning the negative consequences of U.S. plunder on the Argentine economy, but insists that workers' strikes have affected Argentine industry and commerce. The article also falsely accuses, "Some of these strikes are instigated by Communists. They have been creating disputes... They are particularly active in inciting public opposition to Frondizi's oil development plan."

    阿根廷人民反对美国掠夺石油
    美国报纸表示强烈不安
    新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：“美国新闻与世界报道”昨天发表的一篇文章表明，美国对于阿根廷人民强烈反对让美国控制阿根廷石油资源的作法感到非常不安。
    这篇文章的标题是：“阿根廷局势动荡，新的纠纷使美国国内感到不安。”文章说，“在阿根廷最近的危机中牵涉到的东西是很重要的。美国的十亿美元的投资的前途发生了问题。”
    不久前，弗朗迪西政府同美国石油垄断资本签订了合同，允许美国公司在阿根廷石油工业中投资十亿美元。据报道，由于遭到阿根廷石油工人和全国人民的反对，阿根廷政府已经宣布暂时停止在合同上正式签字。
    为了进一步在阿根廷推行经济掠夺政策，这篇文章公然企图指使阿根廷政府对共产党和工人运动进行镇压，文章避而不谈美国的掠夺给阿根廷经济带来的恶果，却硬说工人的罢工使得阿根廷工商业受到影响。文章还诬蔑说，“这些罢工中有一些是共产党人唆使的。他们一直在制造纠纷……他们在鼓动公众反对弗朗迪西的石油开发计划方面特别活跃。”
