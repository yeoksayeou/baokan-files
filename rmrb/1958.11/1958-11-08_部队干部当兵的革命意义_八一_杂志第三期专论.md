The Revolutionary Significance of Military Cadres Serving as Soldiers
Special commentary in the third issue of "August 1st" Magazine
Officer-Soldier Equality is a Consistent Tradition of Our Army
The relationship between officers and soldiers in the Chinese People's Liberation Army is one of equality among ordinary laborers. This equal relationship is a reflection of the communist spirit and a glorious tradition inherent in the Chinese People's Liberation Army. As early as the initial founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chairman Mao established officer-soldier unity as one of the principles of army building. For decades, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has consistently followed Chairman Mao's teachings, using the principle of officer-soldier unity and the idea of officer-soldier equality as the fundamental principles for handling internal military relations. Under the guidance of this principle, officers are leaders, yet they live among the soldiers and appear as ordinary soldiers, subject to the supervision of the masses; soldiers are led, yet have the right to participate in management, and officers and soldiers are politically equal. This equal relationship is an extremely important factor in ensuring that the army defeats enemies far stronger than ourselves.

"Regularization" Once Affected Officer-Soldier Equality
However, there has been struggle in the history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army regarding whether to adhere to the principle of officer-soldier unity. In the past few years, under the slogan of "regularization," a countercurrent of bourgeois privilege thinking emerged in the military. Some people opposed our excellent tradition of officer-soldier unity and officer-soldier equality, calling it a "rural style," "guerrilla habits," "not in line with the requirements of regularization," and so on. As a result, our original fine tradition of officers and soldiers mingling together and treating each other equally was weakened, many officers became more bureaucratic, contact with soldiers decreased, and the relationship between officers and soldiers became "regularized," but the emotional bond became distant. What does all this illustrate? It shows that the so-called "regularization" reflected in the officer-soldier relationship is precisely the "bureaucratization" that we resolutely oppose, and the so-called "rural style" and "guerrilla habits" are precisely the genuine Marxist style and the communist spirit that we must greatly promote.

Cadres Serving as Soldiers is Key to Officer-Soldier Equality
The most important aspect of establishing an equal relationship between officers and soldiers lies in breaking down the bourgeois privilege thinking in the minds of cadres, establishing the communist concept of equality, and thoroughly eliminating bureaucracy. Some of our cadres, influenced by the privilege thinking of the exploiting classes, regard the officer-soldier relationship as merely one of "I order you, and you obey me," treating the certain powers given by the people to carry out work as personal privileges, and so on. These views are completely incompatible with Marxist views. We believe that officers and soldiers are both members of the revolutionary ranks and ordinary laborers. The different positions held by officers and soldiers are merely necessary divisions of labor for revolutionary work. Because officers hold leadership positions and the power to lead work, this often easily obscures their original identity as ordinary laborers. If we fail to see the essence beneath this surface phenomenon and make ourselves special among the masses, there is a danger of developing bureaucracy and becoming detached from the masses. We advocate that cadres go to the company to serve as soldiers, to experience the life of soldiers, be managed by squad and platoon leaders, so that they can truly understand the thoughts and feelings of the soldiers and experience the life of the company. This is absolutely essential to eliminate bureaucracy among cadres, establish a truly equal relationship between officers and soldiers, and cultivate the communist character of cadres.

Promoting the Growth of Soldiers' Egalitarian Concepts
Cadres going down to the company to serve as soldiers not only changes the mental outlook of the cadres themselves, but also promotes the growth of soldiers' communist egalitarian concepts. Unequal concepts exist not only in some cadres, but also in the minds of some soldiers. Some of them always think that officers must be more special than soldiers and cannot be the same as soldiers. The reasons for this unequal thinking mainly come from three aspects: first, the influence of old bourgeois legal rights thinking; second, the influence of "bureaucracy" on the part of some cadres; and third, insufficient contact and understanding of cadres. The influence of this old legal rights concept in the minds of soldiers needs to be addressed through education, but more importantly, cadres must put down their airs, serve as soldiers like them, mingle with them everywhere, and use facts to influence them, so that they feel that there is no difference between cadres and soldiers, thereby changing their unequal views of officers. The experience of Commander Yang Dezhi serving as a soldier in the company proves this point. Before seeing Commander Yang, soldiers always thought that senior commanders must be different from soldiers. However, after Commander Yang went to the company to serve as a soldier, he was like an ordinary soldier in every aspect, eating, living, operating, and working with the soldiers, rushing to do errands and chores, and exemplarily observing various living systems. In this way, in contact with Commander Yang, the soldiers did not feel any estrangement at all, but a completely equal comrade relationship. After this spirit of equality is established in the minds of the soldiers, they will in turn use this spirit to demand that cadres treat them equally. This situation has already appeared in the military: soldiers say to some bureaucratic cadres: "The leaders can treat us equally, why can't you!" This creates pressure on some cadres, which will greatly help to overcome the "bureaucracy" of cadres.

Preparing Conditions for Transition to Communism
Cadres serving as soldiers has even more far-reaching significance, which is to prepare conditions for the transition to a communist society. Our country is currently in a great era where one day equals twenty years. With the rapid advancement of industry and agriculture, and with the rapid development of the national people's commune movement, accelerating the construction of socialism and preparing conditions for communism has become a very urgent issue before us. In our army itself, gradually narrowing the difference in mental and physical labor reflected in the labor methods of officers and soldiers, and greatly improving communist consciousness, so as to embody the communist equality between officers and soldiers on a higher basis, has become a very important task. Cadres serving as soldiers is one of the measures to gradually narrow this gap between physical and mental labor.

Cadres serving as soldiers has now become a upsurge throughout the military. It is entirely believable that by continuing to implement this revolutionary measure, our glorious tradition of officer-soldier equality will definitely be greatly promoted on a new basis, thereby making the construction of our army shine with extraordinary brilliance!

    部队干部当兵的革命意义
    “八一”杂志第三期专论
    官兵平等是我军的一贯传统
    中国人民解放军的官兵关系，也就是普通劳动者之间的平等关系。这种平等的关系，是共产主义精神的体现，是中国人民解放军固有的光荣传统。早在中国人民解放军的初创时期，毛主席就把官兵一致，确定为解放军建军的原则之一。几十年来，中国人民解放军始终遵循着毛主席的教导，以官兵一致的原则，官兵平等的思想，作为处理军队内部关系的根本原则。在这一原则的指导下，军官是领导者，又生活在士兵群众之中，以普通军人姿态出现，受群众的监督；士兵是被领导者，又有权参加管理，官兵政治平等。这种平等关系是保证军队打败那些比我们强大得多的敌人的一个极其重要的因素。
      正规化一度影响了官兵平等
    但是，中国人民解放军在历史上对于要不要坚持官兵一致的原则并不是没有斗争的。前几年，在“正规化”的口号下，部队中就曾出现过一股资产阶级特权思想的逆流。有人曾把我们官兵一致、官兵平等的优良传统，说成是“农村作风”“游击习气”“不合乎正规化的要求”等等，加以反对。结果，我们原有的官兵打成一片、平等相处的优良传统被削弱了，不少军官的官气增加了，同士兵的联系减少了，官兵之间的关系“正规”了，感情却疏远了。这一切说明了什么呢？说明了表现在官兵关系方面的所谓“正规化”，正是我们所坚决反对的“官僚化”，所谓“农村作风”“游击习气”，正是地地道道的马克思主义的作风，正是我们所要大大发扬的共产主义精神。
      干部当兵是官兵平等的关键
    官兵之间平等关系的建立，最重要的在于在干部思想中破资产阶级的特权思想，立共产主义的平等观念，彻底打掉官气。我们有些干部，受了剥削阶级特权思想的影响，把官兵关系，看成只是我命令你，你服从我的关系，把人民给予的实施工作的一定权力，视为个人特权等等。这些观点同马克思主义的观点是毫不相容的。我们认为，官兵同是革命队伍中的一员，同是普通劳动者，官兵担负的职务不同只是革命工作必要的分工。由于军官担负领导职务，领导工作的职权，常常容易掩盖了他本来的普通劳动者的身份，如果看不到这种表面现象下的本质，使自己在群众中特殊起来，那就有发展官气，脱离群众的危险。我们提倡干部下连队当兵，就是要使干部下到连队去，过一过士兵生活，让班、排长管一管，使他们真正能够熟悉士兵的思想感情，体验连队的生活。这对打掉干部的官气，建立官兵之间真正平等的关系和培养干部的共产主义品德是绝不可少的。
      促使士兵平等观念的成长
    干部下连当兵不仅改变着干部本身的精神面貌，而且促使了士兵的共产主义平等观念的成长。不平等的观念不仅在一些干部中存在，在一些士兵头脑中也存在。他们有的总认为官总要比士兵特殊些，不能和士兵一样。产生这种不平等观念的原因主要是来自三个方面：一是来自旧的资产阶级法权思想的影响，二是来自部分干部“官气”的影响，三是对干部接触较少，了解不够。战士们头脑中的这种旧的法权观念的影响，一方面要靠教育，但更重要地要靠干部放下架子，同他们一样当兵，处处和他们打成一片，用事实影响他们，使他们觉得干部和士兵并没有什么两样，从而改变他们对军官的一些不平等的看法。杨得志司令员下连当兵的情况就证明了这一点。士兵在见到杨司令员之前，脑子里总是想高级司令员一定和士兵不一样。可是，杨司令员下连当兵之后，各方面都像普通士兵一样，和战士同吃、同住、同操作、同劳动，公差勤务抢着干，各种生活制度都模范地遵守。这样士兵们在同杨司令员的接触中，根本感不到有什么隔阂，完全是平等的战友关系。这种平等精神在战士头脑中树立起来之后，反回来他们就会以这种精神要求干部与他们平等相处。现在部队中已出现这种情况：士兵们对某些有官气的干部说：“首长们都能和我们平等相处，你们为什么不能！”这就形成了对某些干部的压力，这种压力会大大有利于克服干部的“官气”。
      为过渡到共产主义准备条件
    干部下连当兵还有更深远的意义，就是为过渡到共产主义社会准备条件。目前我们的国家正处在一天等于二十年的伟大时代，随着工农业一日千里的飞跃前进，随着全国人民公社运动的飞速发展，加速建成社会主义，并为共产主义准备条件，就做为一个非常迫切的问题摆在我们面前了。在我们军队本身来说，逐步缩小反映在军官和士兵劳动方式上的脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别，大大地提高共产主义觉悟，以便在更高的基础上体现军官和士兵之间的共产主义平等关系，就成为一个十分重要的课题。干部下连当兵，正是逐步缩小这种体力劳动与脑力劳动差别的措施之一。
    干部下连当兵，目前已在全军中形成了一个热潮。完全可以相信，把这一革命措施继续贯彻下去，我们官兵平等的光荣传统，一定会在新的基础上大大发扬起来，从而使我军的建设发出奇光异彩！
