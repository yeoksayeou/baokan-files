    Utilizing Cotton Stalks to Vigorously Heat Up Kang Beds
    (Our dispatch) Since the Beginning of Winter, Anyang County, Henan Province, has experienced continuous rain and a sharp drop in temperature. The Party Committee of the Anfeng People's Commune in the county held a meeting overnight to comprehensively arrange the commune members' winter lives, ensuring that the broad masses of commune members are warm in body, warm in their homes, and even warmer in their hearts, fully demonstrating the Party's meticulous care for the masses and the immense superiority of the People's Commune.
    The Anfeng People's Commune is a cotton-producing area with relatively affluent economic conditions, and the problem of winter cotton clothing and bedding is not significant. Generally, the "Five Guarantees" households, single men, and needy households lacking cotton clothing and bedding are all resolved by the commune. The commune has already distributed cotton to the sewing factory, and the cotton clothing and bedding will be distributed to the commune members in need within three to five days.
    The current issue that the commune needs to address urgently is heating. This area is close to the Hebei Plain, and the masses have a habit of burning coal for heating. In the past, the state mostly supplied coal. This year, coal is primarily supplied to the iron and steel front, and the commune must solve the heating fuel problem itself. The Party Committee first decided to promote earthen heating and vigorously heat up kang beds. At the same time, it mobilized commune members to collect cotton stalks, firewood, tree stumps, sawdust, and other materials as winter heating fuel. In the case of cotton stalks alone, the commune's cotton fields can yield more than 60 million jin of peeled cotton stalks, averaging nearly 2,000 jin per person.
    In terms of fuel supply, priority is given to children, the elderly, and women in confinement. All sixteen maternity hospitals have now been supplied with coal, and the forty-seven nurseries and twenty-two homes for the elderly have begun to renovate kang beds for heating. Nurseries have found warm houses to disperse the feeding of infants. Secondly, half of the workers in the iron and steel corps originally lived in shacks, but they have now all been moved to residential houses, and like ordinary commune members, they all burn heated kang beds for warmth.
    The commune has built fifty-seven simple canteens and vacated more than one hundred rooms as dining halls to ensure that commune members can eat hot meals indoors.
    To ensure that commune members get good rest and production proceeds rhythmically, the Party Committee of the Commune has formulated a sleeping "constitution," stipulating that commune members sleep eight hours a day, work normally for twenty days a month, engage in shock labor for seven days, and spend the remaining three days studying culture and politics and engaging in recreational activities. Female laborers can also reduce their working hours by two days to handle housework. Continuous shock overtime work should not exceed two days, and even during shock work, six hours of rest must be guaranteed.
    The broad masses of commune members were deeply moved by this regulation. Dong Di, a woman from Zhangjia Village, simply said, "Chairman Mao is so thoughtful, concerned about national affairs, and also concerned about the lives of us commune members, even thinking about our eating, clothing, and sleeping! We would be letting Chairman Mao down if we didn't work hard." She picked eighty jin of cotton in one morning, compared to only forty jin in the past. Yan Zhiduan, a commune member from Fengle Town, said, "Eating well, dressing warmly, and sleeping well make our production enthusiasm increase day by day, and one day is better than twenty years!" The town's cotton picking has increased from eighty jin per person per day to more than two hundred jin.

### 利用棉秆　大烧暖炕

    利用棉秆　大烧暖炕
    本报讯　河南安阳县在立冬过后，连天阴雨，气温骤降。这县安丰人民公社党委会连夜开会，全面安排社员的过冬生活，保证广大社员身上暖，屋里暖，心里更暖，充分体现出党对群众无微不至的关怀，以及人民公社的巨大优越性。
    安丰人民公社是产棉区，经济条件较富裕，过冬棉衣棉被问题不大。一般五保户，单身汉及困难户缺棉衣棉被的，全由公社解决。公社已将棉花发给缝纫厂，三五天内即可将棉衣棉被发给短缺的社员。
    当前公社要突击解决的是取暖问题。这里地近河北平原，群众有烧煤火习惯，过去多由国家供应煤炭。今年煤炭主要供给钢铁战线，取暖燃料须公社自己解决。党委会首先决定推广土暖气，大量烧暖炕。与此同时，发动社员把棉秆、木柴、树疙瘩、锯末等收集起来作冬季取暖燃料。仅棉秆一项，全社棉田可收剥过皮的棉秆六千万多斤，平均每人可分配近二千斤。
    在燃料供应上，首先照顾小孩、老人及产妇。十六所妇产院现已供应煤火，四十七所幼儿院二十二所幸福院，已开始改建暖炕，托儿所已找暖和房子分散喂哺。其次，钢铁兵团工人原有一半住工棚，现已全部移住民房，与一般社员一样都烧暖炕取暖。
    公社已建简易饭厅五十七个，腾房一百多间作为饭堂，保证社员能在室内吃到热饭。
    为了使社员休息好，生产有节奏地进行，公社党委会制定了睡觉“宪法”，规定社员每天睡觉八小时，每月正常劳动二十天，突击劳动七天，下余三天学习文化政治及进行娱乐活动。女劳力还可减少二天劳动时间，以便处理家务。连续突击加班，不超过二天，突击时也要保证六小时休息。
    广大社员对这个规定十分感动，张家庄妇女董弟只说，毛主席想的真周到，关心国家大事，还关心俺社员生活，连吃饭穿衣睡觉都想到了；不好好干对不起毛主席。她一上午就摘棉花八十斤，过去只摘四十斤。丰乐镇社员阎志端说，吃饱、穿暖、睡得好，生产干劲日日高，一天胜过二十年。全镇摘棉花由每人一天八十斤增加到二百多斤。
