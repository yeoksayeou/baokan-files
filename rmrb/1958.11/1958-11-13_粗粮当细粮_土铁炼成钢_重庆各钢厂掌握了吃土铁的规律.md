Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, November 12th: Since October, small open-hearth furnaces in Chongqing steel plants have begun to use large quantities of native iron for steelmaking and have now basically mastered the laws of using native iron for steelmaking. To date, steel plants have used native iron from dozens of counties in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces.

This native iron contains many harmful impurities such as sulfur and phosphorus; the silicon and manganese content is sometimes very high and sometimes very low. High impurity content makes it difficult to digest during steelmaking, prolongs smelting time, and easily damages the furnace body. Therefore, workers call using native iron for steelmaking eating "coarse grains." At the same time, the source of native iron is very complex, and the composition is not standardized, which brings a series of new problems to smelting technology.

When the employees of the small open-hearth furnace of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company first used native iron for steelmaking, they mixed 20% to 30% of native iron with very high sulfur content with pig iron from large factories for smelting. This prolonged the smelting time of each furnace of steel by one to two hours, and often burned the furnace roof and walls. Later, the workshop organized cadres, engineers, technicians, and workers to conduct experiments together, and the company's party committee secretary and technical leading cadres personally participated. First, in the early stage of steelmaking, they tried to remove as much acidic slag as possible to remove some of the sulfur and phosphorus dissolved in the steel slag. Then, in the refining process, they added more lime, dolomite, and other slag-making agents, and used more iron oxide scale to reduce the melting point of lime, so that the steel slag was active and the molten steel boiled well. The impurities then produced oxidation with lime and dolomite. After a few more rakes of the steel slag, these impurities were largely removed from the furnace. At the same time, the workshop also used a mixed desulfurizer of lime, dolomite, and soda ash to desulfurize in the pig iron furnace. In this way, after using large quantities of native iron for steelmaking, not only was the impact on smelting time greatly reduced, but the furnace body was also guaranteed against erosion or burning. By November 9, when the furnace was shut down for repairs, the furnace age of the two open-hearth furnaces in the workshop had reached 305 heats. The quality of the steel also fully met the national requirements.

The experience of the small open-hearth furnace of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has been successfully applied after it was passed on to the Chongqing Third Steel Plant. The proportion of native iron used in steelmaking raw materials in this plant has recently reached 80%. In addition to adopting the steps of mixed desulfurizer, pig iron furnace desulfurization, and open-hearth desulfurization and phosphorus removal, they also aimed at the erosion of the slag line and the furnace bottom in the furnace by harmful impurities in the steel slag, and used more alkaline materials such as lime, magnesia, and dolomite when patching the furnace, and patched it once for each heat of steel. Now the smelting time of each furnace of steel in this plant is only 45 minutes to 1 hour longer than in the past; the two open-hearth furnaces have each smelted 107 and 113 heats respectively from the middle of October to now after repairs, and the smelting situation is still very normal. The refined steel was rolled into batches of railway sleepers and steel.

In order to solve the problem of complex composition and inconsistent specifications of native iron, various factories have also adopted the method of more testing and more analysis to strictly control the different components of various native irons. When batching, high and low impurity components are used together, so that there will not be too many difficulties in steelmaking. In the past month or so, native iron from all over Sichuan and Guizhou has been used in steelmaking.

### 粗粮当细粮　土铁炼成钢  重庆各钢厂掌握了吃土铁的规律

    粗粮当细粮　土铁炼成钢
    重庆各钢厂掌握了吃土铁的规律
    据新华社重庆12日电　重庆各钢铁厂小型平炉从10月份起，开始大量用土铁炼钢，现在已经基本上掌握了土铁炼钢的规律。到目前为止，各钢铁厂已经使用了四川、贵州两省几十个县的土铁。
    这些土铁含硫、磷等有害杂质多；含矽、锰成分有的很高，有的很低。含杂质成分高，炼钢时就不容易消化，冶炼时间长，容易损坏炉体，因此工人们都把用土铁炼钢称为吃“粗粮”。同时土铁来源很复杂，成分没有一定规格，因此给冶炼技术上带来了一系列的新问题。
    重庆钢铁公司小平炉职工最先用土铁炼钢时，他们用20％到30％含硫量很高的土铁与大厂生铁掺合冶炼，曾使每炉钢的冶炼时间拉长一、二小时，还常常把炉顶和炉墙烧坏。后来车间里组织干部、工程技术人员和工人一起，公司党委书记和技术领导干部亲自参加试验，首先在炼钢的溶化初期就尽量多扒去酸性渣子，把熔解在钢渣中的硫、磷排除一部分；然后在精炼过程中，又多加石灰、白云石等作造渣剂，并且多用氧化铁皮降低石灰熔点，使钢渣活跃，钢水沸腾很好，杂质就和石灰、白云石产生氧化作用，多扒几次钢渣就把这些杂质大量扒出炉外。同时，这个车间还用石灰、白云石、苏打混合脱硫剂在化铁炉进行脱硫。这样，在大量使用土铁炼钢后，不仅在冶炼时间上受的影响大大减少，并且保证了炉体不受侵蚀或烧坏。到11月9日停炉中修为止，这个车间两座平炉炉龄已达三百零五炉。钢的质量也全部达到了国家要求。
    重庆钢铁公司小平炉的经验传到重庆第三钢铁厂以后，也得到了成功的运用。这个厂最近炼钢原料掺用土铁的比例已达80％。他们除了采用混合脱硫剂、化铁炉脱硫和平炉脱硫、磷的步骤以外，还针对钢渣中有害杂质对炉内渣线和炉底的侵蚀，在补炉时多用石灰、镁砂和白云石等碱性物质，并且每炼一炉钢就补一次。现在这个厂每炉钢的冶炼时间只比过去延长四十五分钟到一小时；两座平炉从10月中旬中修后到现在，已分别炼了一百零七炉和一百一十三炉，冶炼情况仍然很正常。炼出来的钢轧成了成批的铁路垫板和钢材。
    为了解决土铁成分复杂、规格不一的问题，各厂还采取了多化验、多分析的办法，严格掌握各种土铁的不同成分。在配料时，将杂质成分高低兼搭使用，就不至于在炼钢时造成过多困难。一个多月来，来自四川、贵州各地的土铁已全部用到炼钢上去。
