    Strive to Promote the Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine
    Two Famous Western Doctors Request to Study Traditional Chinese Medicine
    (Reported by our newspaper) Wu Yingkai and Zhu Guiqing, two Western medicine doctors from the China Academy of Medical Sciences' Fuchengmenwai Hospital, recently submitted reports to the hospital's Party committee requesting to resign from their positions to study traditional Chinese medicine.
    Wu Yingkai is a famous expert in thoracic surgery and a member of the Soviet Surgical Society, currently serving as the president of Fuchengmenwai Hospital. Zhu Guiqing is a famous expert in pulmonary tuberculosis and currently the director of the Department of Tuberculosis. In his report, Wu Yingkai said that in the past he believed that "surgery is still better with Western medicine." However, recent facts have shown that many problems that Western medicine cannot solve or can only solve at a great cost can be solved quickly, economically, and effectively with traditional Chinese medicine and herbs. These facts have made him realize the correctness of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine and the absolute necessity for Western doctors to study traditional Chinese medicine. In his report, Zhu Guiqing also mentioned that he used to be ignorant and prejudiced towards traditional Chinese medicine. He is willing to dedicate the rest of his life to promoting the development of traditional Chinese medicine.

    为发扬祖国医学而努力
    两位名西医要求学中医
    本报讯　中国医学科学院阜成门外医院吴英恺和朱贵卿两位西医，最近向这个医院的党委提出报告，要求离职学习中医。
    吴英恺是胸科外科名专家、苏联外科学会会员，现任阜成门外医院院长；朱贵卿是肺结核名专家，现为结核科主任。吴英恺在报告中说，过去他认为“外科还是西医好”，但是，最近许多事实说明，许多西医不能解决或是要付出很大代价才能解决的问题，中医中药都有多快好省的办法，这些事实使他认识了党的中医政策的正确性和西医学习中医的绝对必要性。朱贵卿在报告中也谈到，他过去对祖国医学是无知的，有偏见的。他愿意在他的后半生中，为发扬祖国医学而努力。
