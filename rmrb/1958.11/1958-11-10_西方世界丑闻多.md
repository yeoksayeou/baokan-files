    Scandals Abound in the Western World

    U.S. Troops Beat People with Impunity, Residents Resist and Are Sentenced
    It seems to be a self-evident truth to the West German judicial authorities that only U.S. troops are allowed to beat people, and residents are not allowed to resist. If you don't believe it, here is the evidence:
    In May of this year, eight U.S. soldiers stationed in Friedberg got drunk. On their way back to the barracks from a tavern, they beat up a group of West German youths for no reason. After gaining this "victory," the U.S. soldiers became even more unscrupulous, beating and cursing anyone they met, not even sparing pregnant women or drivers. The residents of Bruchenbrucken in Friedberg could no longer endure it and fought back with sticks. They struck two U.S. soldiers a few times.
    This caused trouble. Recently, the West German Friedberg County Court authorities tried seventeen innocent residents of Bruchenbrucken for this incident and sentenced seven of the youths to imprisonment and detention on the so-called charge of "disrupting rural peace." As for the U.S. soldiers who committed the assault, they walked out of the courtroom freely after "testifying."

    Cannons Burst Their Bellies, Students Starve
    What is the situation of higher education in France? The answer of "Le Figaro" is: "Higher education destined to perish" is already in a state of "utter poverty."
    According to Paris newspapers, the funds allocated by the French authorities for education are very meager, and teachers, schools, dormitories, and teaching materials are insufficient. This year, higher education needs at least 220 billion francs, but the French government has only allocated 160 billion francs.
    The situation of university students is also not pleasant. Only about 20% of university students will be able to live in school dormitories this academic year. Due to rising prices, students' lives are getting worse and worse. "Le Figaro" admitted: "In addition to the lack of housing, diet is the primary problem for university students." "Le Parisien" also pointed out that "the average living standard of students has decreased by 25% this year."
    Everyone knows that the French government spends hundreds of billions of francs on the war in Algeria without any stinginess. But it is so stingy on education expenditures. It's really: cannons are lucky enough to burst their bellies, but students are not fortunate enough to starve.

    Prostitution Rife in Britain, House of Commons Can't Keep Silent
    The dignified British House of Commons actually has to discuss how to deal with the problem of obscenity. This is not a joke, but a fact.
    The prevalence of prostitution and the corruption of social morals have become extremely serious in Britain, causing strong public anxiety. Hugh Cross, a well-known British jurist, recently pointed out at the annual meeting of the "Association for Social and Moral Questions" that the level of social morality in Britain is low. The unprecedented prevalence of prostitution is constantly eroding many urban residents, especially young people. Cross said that prostitution in London "has become a widely organized industry." This industry brings large incomes to its bosses.
    In addition, base and vulgar performances are everywhere in London at night. Many bookstores in London and many other British cities are filled with obscene "literature." Pornographic films are rampant in cinemas.
    Under the pressure of public opinion, the British House of Commons has to express concern about this issue. However, what kind of society, what kind of customs. Will a battle of words in the British House of Commons change anything?

    西方世界丑闻多
    美军打人无罪　居民反抗判刑
    只许美军打人，不许居民反抗，这在西德司法机关看来，似乎是天经地义的道理。如若不信，有事实为证：
    今年5月，有八个驻扎在弗里德堡的美国兵喝醉了酒。他们在从酒馆回到营盘去的路上，把一群西德青年人无缘无故地痛打了一顿。美国兵在获得这一“胜利”之后，更加肆无忌惮起来，遇见人就连打带骂，连怀孕的妇女和正在开汽车的司机也没有幸免。弗里德堡布鲁亨布吕肯地方的居民忍无可忍，拿起棒棍进行反抗。他们把两名美国兵打了几棒。
    这一下，就惹出祸事来了。最近西德弗里德堡县法院当局为这一事件开庭审讯了布鲁亨布吕肯的十七名无辜居民，并且以所谓“破坏了农村的和平”的罪名把其中的七名青年判处了徒刑和禁闭。至于打人行凶的美国兵，却在出庭“作证”后，逍遥自在地走出了法庭。
    大炮胀破肚　学生饿断肠
    法国高等教育的情况怎样呢？“费加罗报”的回答是：“注定灭亡的高等学校”已经陷于“赤贫状态”。
    据巴黎报纸报道，法国当局拨作教育的经费非常微薄，教师、学校、宿舍和教材都不足。今年高等学校至少需要二千二百亿法郎，而法国政府只拨出了一千六百亿法郎。
    大学生的处境也不美妙。仅仅有20％左右的大学生在这个学年能够住进学校的宿舍里。由于物价上涨，学生们的生活已经越来越恶化。“费加罗报”承认：“除了缺少住的地方以外，饮食是大学生的首要问题。”“巴黎日报”也指出，“今年学生的平均生活水平已经降低了25％。”
    谁都知道，法国政府对打阿尔及利亚战争是一掷几千亿法郎而毫无吝色的。但是在教育开支上却是如此克扣。这真是：大炮有幸胀破肚，学生无福饿断肠。
    英国卖淫风盛　下院也难噤声
    堂堂英国下院，居然要讨论怎样对付淫秽风气问题。这并不是什么笑话，而是千真万确的事。
    卖淫现象盛行和社会风气败坏，在英国已经极其严重，因而引起公众的强烈不安。英国著名法学家休克罗斯最近在“社会道德问题协会”年会上指出，英国社会道德水平低落。空前盛行的卖淫风气不断腐蚀着许多城市居民，特别是腐蚀着青年。休克罗斯说，伦敦的卖淫“已经成了有广泛组织的行业”。这种行业给它的老板带来了大笔收入。
    此外，现在伦敦夜晚到处都是卑鄙下流的演出。伦敦和英国其他许多城市的许多书店都摆满了淫秽“文学”的书籍。色情影片在电影院中泛滥。
    在舆论的压力下，英国下院对这个问题不得不表示关心。但是，有什么样的社会，就有什么样的风气。英国下院唇枪舌箭地争吵一场，难道会使事情有什么改变吗？
