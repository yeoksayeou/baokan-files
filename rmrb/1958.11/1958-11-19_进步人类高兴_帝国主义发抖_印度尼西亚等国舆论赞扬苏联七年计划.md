Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Soviet Union's seven-year plan for developing the national economy continues to be praised and valued by public opinion in various countries. Jakarta's "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 18th hailing the draft of the Soviet seven-year plan. The editorial said that the completion of this plan will greatly strengthen the Soviet Union, the entire socialist camp, and the forces of the world peace camp.

The editorial pointed out that this plan is certain to be realized. It said that if anyone does not believe that these figures can become a reality, he is only replaying the kind of stupidity shown by those capitalists when the Soviet Union announced its first five-year plan.

The editorial pointed out that some people are attempting to obliterate the significance of this amazing plan by despicable means, and attempting to divert the aspirations of working people around the world for socialism. The newspaper said that their actions will ultimately be in vain.

India's "Freedom Daily" pointed out in its editorial on the 17th that the Soviet Union's seven-year plan "can only be a daydream for the capitalist world."

The editorial said that the capitalist world is sinking deeper and deeper into the vortex of crisis, and it cannot find any other way out except to prepare for war and destruction. The ambitious plan for peaceful construction put forward by the Soviet Union once again affirms that socialism is a superior and lofty system compared to capitalism; moreover, it is only possible to do so when political power is in the hands of the working class under the leadership of the Communist Party. This also proves that the Soviet Union sincerely desires world peace.

The newspaper emphasized that "the success of this plan is not only beneficial to socialist countries, but also to Asian and African countries that have recently gained independence and are fighting for freedom." It pointed out that, therefore, it is necessary for India and other countries to make greater efforts to further strengthen the struggle to defend peace for the benefit of their own countries.

Damascus's "Al-Nour" newspaper published an editorial on the 17th saying, "The Soviet Union's seven-year plan is indeed a program to support peace and human progress. If the imperialists are trembling with fear at the progress of the Soviet Union, we Arabs are happy with the progress of this socialist country, because this great socialist country is the first and strongest friend in our struggle."

The editorial pointed out that the Soviet Union supports the Arab people's struggle to safeguard national independence and sovereignty. The progress and development of the Soviet Union is conducive to the construction and industrialization progress of the Arab people.

The editorial praised the Soviet Union for putting forward an open call for peaceful economic competition between the two camps. It said that this call on the one hand shows the strength and burgeoning prospects of the socialist system to the people of all countries, as well as its infinite capacity for progress and prosperity; on the other hand, it illustrates the weakness of the imperialist system, because it fears this call and attempts to avoid its demise by means of aggression, war and conspiracies against the people.

    进步人类高兴　帝国主义发抖
    印度尼西亚等国舆论赞扬苏联七年计划
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：苏联发展国民经济的七年计划，继续受到各国舆论的赞扬和重视。雅加达“人民日报”18日发表社论欢呼苏联的七年计划草案。社论说，这项计划的完成，将大大加强苏联和整个社会主义阵营的力量以及世界和平阵营的力量。
    社论指出，这项计划是一定会实现的。它说，如果有谁不相信这些数字能够变成现实的话，他只有再度表现当苏联宣布第一个五年计划时那些资本家们所表现的那种愚蠢。
    社论指出，有人企图用卑劣的手段来抹煞这一惊人的计划的意义，企图转移全世界劳动人民争取社会主义的愿望。这家报纸说，他们这种做法最后只能是白费心机。
    印度“自由报”在17日发表的社论中指出，苏联的七年计划“对资本主义世界来说，只能是白日梦”。
    社论说，资本主义世界愈来愈深地陷入危机的漩涡中，它除了进行战争准备和破坏以外，不能找到别的出路。苏联提出的这项雄心很大的和平建设计划，再一次肯定地证明，社会主义是比资本主义优越和崇高的制度；而且，只有在政权掌握在共产党领导下的工人阶级的手中的时候，才有可能这样做。这件事还证明，苏联是衷心渴望世界和平的。
    报纸强调说，“这项计划的成功不但有利于社会主义国家，而且有利于最近获得独立的和正在为争取自由而斗争的亚非国家。”它指出，因此印度和其他国家为了本国的利益，有必要作更大的努力来进一步加强保卫和平的斗争。
    大马士革“光明报”17日发表社论说，“苏联的七年计划确实是支持和平和人类进步的纲领。如果帝国主义者对苏联的进步害怕得发抖的话，我们阿拉伯人却对这个社会主义国家的进展感到高兴，因为这个伟大的社会主义国家是我们斗争中的第一个和最强大的朋友。”
    社论指出，苏联支持阿拉伯人民维护民族独立和主权的斗争。苏联的进步和发展有利于阿拉伯人民的建设和工业化的进展。
    社论称赞苏联提出两个阵营之间进行和平的经济竞赛的公开呼吁。它说，这个呼吁一方面向各国人民表明了社会主义制度的力量和蒸蒸日上的景象以及它进步和繁荣的无限能力；另一方面说明了帝国主义制度的弱点，因为它害怕这个呼吁，并且企图用侵略、战争和阴谋反对人民等手段来使它免于灭亡。
