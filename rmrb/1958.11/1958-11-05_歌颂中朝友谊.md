    In Praise of Sino-Korean Friendship
    Guo Moruo
  Titled Good Bamboo Bridge, Han City vaguely in sight, Triangle Mountain like a fence. There is a bridge named Good Bamboo, with inscriptions commemorating loyal souls. Tear stains remain on the base of the monument, bloodstains visible at the bridge's end. More than a century after the fall of the Ming, it still commemorates the Chongzhen era.
    (Note) Good Bamboo Bridge is near Kaesong, the site where Zheng Yinpu, a loyal subject of the Goryeo Dynasty, died. The Yi Dynasty erected two steles praising him, one inscribed by King Yeongjo, stating "113 years after the Chongzhen Era," and the other erected by King Gojong, stating "245 years after the Chongzhen Era."
  Visiting Pakyon Falls After the rain, the mountain air is still, the waterfall hanging down like ten thousand white threads. Dense trees make one doubt there is a path, strangely shaped rocks reveal a unique realm. The sound of a flute emerges from the depths of the pool, frost-colored flames burn at the mountain peak. Countless Jin Niang are there, whistling and singing atop Tianma Peak.
    (Note) Pakyon Falls is not far from Kaesong. Legend says a young man named Park sat on a giant rock by the pool, playing the flute, moving the dragon maiden in the pool, and was lured into the water. On the rock are fourteen characters in Huang Jin-i's cursive script: "Flying straight down three thousand feet, it is suspected the Silver River falls from the nine heavens" (from a poem by Li Bai), the brushstrokes vigorous.
    Huang Jin-i is said to be a Korean female poet from four hundred years ago, beautiful and skilled in singing and dancing, generally known as Huang Jin Niang. The high ridge where the waterfall is located is called Tianma Peak, with frost-covered leaves everywhere, as red as fire.
  Passing Through Iron Pass Iron Pass towers with strange peaks, spiraling up into the azure sky. Springs tumble along the stream, white with foam, frost dyes the mountains red. Three years of war to defend the country, a hundred generations of merit to save the world. The villagers' clothes are clean, as if in a painting.
    (Note) Iron Pass is on the way to Mount Kumgang, the road extremely dangerous, and the only transportation route supporting the front lines during the war.
    Visiting Nine Dragon Pool Falls Eight Poems 1. White stones scatter in the stream, the Silver River descends to the nine provinces. Guanyin has just emerged from her bath, Jade Maiden has finished combing her hair. Tree shadows calm the heart, the sound of the spring pierces the ears with its serenity. A floating bridge is cabled with iron chains, like a dream.
    (Note) Nine Dragon Pool Falls is one of the famous scenic spots in Mount Kumgang. Guanyin and Jade Maiden are both peak names, the stream is named Cold Dew, and there are eight iron-chained bridges above it. The mountain path winds upwards, sometimes on this bank, sometimes on that, leading directly to the bottom of the waterfall. 2. The groves of trees are lush and green, the phoenix soars atop the mountain. Human voices harmonize with the sound of the stream, the mountain colors purify the fragrance of the sky. Are there no roots in Southern paintings? The Eastern neighbor truly has light. The intermingling of green and red is dazzling, the sky lowered.
    (Note) There is a peak with a rock at its top shaped like a flying bird, hence the name Flying Phoenix Rock; there is also a waterfall named Flying Phoenix Waterfall. 3. The red leaves are just right, good to take up a brush and write poetry. Poetry reaches the beauty of Mount Kumgang, people come and Jade Maiden lowers herself. Feet ascend the spine of the Flying Phoenix, palms caress the eyebrows of the World Honored One. There is water clearer than jade, no peak where the trees are not wondrous.
    (Note) Kumgang is the general name for the mountains, Jade Maiden, Flying Phoenix, World Honored One, etc., are all peak names. 4. The more one climbs, the stranger and more magnificent it becomes, the scenery unfolds as if in a mirror. A turtle lies prostrate atop the mountain, a fish comes from the sea. Who cleaved the dangerous cliffs with an axe? The strange trees seem like potted plants. Roots can live without soil, growing independently.
    (Note) There is a mountain like a fortress, with a giant rock lying prostrate on top, shaped like a turtle. Legend also says: a large snapping turtle fish swam upstream from the sea, directly to the Jade Stream Cave, etc. 5. The flat rock is like a table, heavenly flowers scattered across the nine realms. Silver beads connect the nostrils of the mirror, iron chains lock the red cheeks. Dragons dance at the bottom of the gorge, phoenixes come flying to the mountaintop. Two or three painters are there, wasting their efforts in vain.
    (Note) There is the Jade Stream Cave along the way, the stone in the stream is larger than a giant dining table. Two or three foreign guests were painting on the rock. Heavenly Flowers is also a peak name. 6. Arriving at the bottom of the Dragon's Saliva, one feels the mountains are lower. A thousand fathoms of white silk hang down, ten thousand turns descend the cloud ladder. The cliffs stand towering to the sky, the abyss is deep and penetrating. Raise a glass to invite the Jade Maiden, for you are too precipitous.
    (Note) Nine Dragon Pool Falls is spewed out from the mountain gully! Behind it is Jade Maiden Peak. The waterfall cascades down the rocks, forming a sharp bend in the lower reaches before leaping down again. Opposite the waterfall, there is a place for tourists to rest, where we had lunch. I once raised my glass to toast Jade Maiden Peak. 7. Passing under the Kumgang Gate, people say to lower your head. Piled stones lead to the heavenly palace, layered rocks look out on the sea. Clothes are stained with greasy drizzle, hats are removed as sweat pours down. Returning steps are as swift as flight, ten thousand peaks are taken in at a glance.
    (Note) Along the way, there are huge rocks naturally piled into a natural gate, called Kumgang Gate. There are also cliffs formed in layers, resembling high-rise buildings. 8. The poem drafts were lost on the way back, a sigh that this trip was in vain. Like a plantain deer dream, reluctantly entrusted to King Chu's bow. Suddenly, news came that the mud swallow had returned, making it difficult to restrain the soaring thoughts. Protecting people and art, thanks should be twofold.
    (Note) The first six poems about the visit to Nine Dragon Pool were hastily written during the climb. On the way down the mountain, they were put in the pocket of a coat and lost by a follower. However, they were picked up and returned by a People's Army soldier. During the visit to Mount Kumgang, the Korean government mobilized a large number of People's Army soldiers to guard the route, so twofold thanks should be given.

    歌颂中朝友谊
    郭沫若
  题善竹桥汉城遥在望，三角山如藩。有桥名善竹，刻石表忠魂。碑跗留啼迹，桥端见血痕。明亡逾百载，犹纪崇祯元。
    （注）善竹桥在开城附近，乃高丽王朝忠臣郑隐圃死难处。李氏王朝立丰碑二通称颂之，一为英宗所口，其为“崇祯纪元后一百一十三年”，又一为高宗所立，其为“崇祯纪元后二百四十五年”。
  游朴渊瀑布雨余山气静，瀑白万丝悬。树密疑无路，岩奇别有天。笛声渊底出，霜色岭头燃。无数真娘在，啸歌天马巅。
    （注）朴渊瀑布离开城不远。相传有朴姓少年，坐渊畔巨石上吹笛、感动渊中龙女、被诱入渊水中。巨石上有黄真伊草书“飞流直下三千丈，疑是银河落九天”（李白诗句）十四字，笔势矫健。
    黄真伊据云乃四百年前朝鲜女诗人，貌美，善歌舞，一般称为黄真娘。瀑布所在高岭名天马峰，霜叶处处，鲜红如火。
  过铁岭铁岭耸奇峰，盘旋上碧空。泉翻沿涧白，霜染遍山红。卫国三年战，回天百代功。乡人衣带洁，如在画图中。
    （注）铁岭在赴金刚山途中，道甚险峻，为战时支援前线唯一交通要道。
    游九龙渊瀑布八首一白石乱溪流，银河下九州。观音新出浴，玉女罢梳头。树影偕心定，泉声彻耳幽。浮桥铁索缆，仿佛梦中游。
    （注）九龙渊瀑布乃金刚山中名胜之一。观音、玉女均峰名，溪名寒露，上有铁索桥八道。山途迂回而上，时在此岸，时在彼岸，直达瀑布下。二群树郁苍苍，山头飞凤皇。人声和溪响，峰色净天香。南画宁无本？东邻信有光。青红纷烂缦，天宇为低昂。
    （注）有一峰，峰头有岩，其形类飞鸟，因名飞凤岩；有瀑布即名飞凤瀑布。三红叶正当时，把笔好题诗。诗到金刚美，人来玉女低。脚登飞凤脊，掌抚世尊眉。有水清于玉，无峰树不奇。
    （注）金刚乃群山总名，玉女、飞凤、世尊等，均峰名。四登临愈奇绝，胜境镜中开。龟在山头伏，鱼从海上来。危岩谁斧劈？奇树似盆栽。无土根能活，生生自主裁。
    （注）有山如城砦，其上伏一巨石，形似龟。又传说：有大蚂蛤鱼由海溯溪而上，直达玉流洞云云。五磐石平如案，天花散九垓。银珠联镜鼻，铁索锁红腮。峡底游龙舞，山头飞凤来。画人三两在，枉自费安排。
    （注）途中有玉流洞，石在溪中，大逾巨大餐桌。有两三外宾在石上作油画。天花亦峰名。六来到龙涎底，群山已觉低。千寻垂白练，万转下云梯。崖峭摩天立，渊深彻地?。举杯邀玉女，为汝太嵚崎。
    （注）九龙渊瀑布由山?中吐出！其后为玉女峰。瀑布垂岩倾泻，在低处呈磬折形，再飞跃而下。与瀑布相对，有供游人止息处，在此用午餐。余曾举杯向玉女峰干杯。七金刚门下过，人道要低头。垒石通天阙，层岩望海楼。沾衣酥雨腻，脱帽汗珠流。归步如飞速，万峰一目收。
    （注）途中有巨大岩石，自然垒成天然门阙，号金刚门。亦有崖成层，颇似高层建筑。八诗稿归途失，此行叹落空。浑如蕉鹿梦，勉付楚王弓。忽报泥鸿返，难禁意马翀。护人兼护艺，感谢应双重。
    （注）游九龙渊诗前六首乃登山途中所速写。下山时揣入大衣口袋中为从者遗失。但却为人民军战士所拾得，归还。游金刚山时朝鲜政府曾动员大批人民军沿途警卫，故应致双重感谢。
