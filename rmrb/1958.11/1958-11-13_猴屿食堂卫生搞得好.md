    The Hygiene of the Houyu Cafeteria is Well Done
    Anyone who has been to Houyu will praise their cafeteria for being well-run.
    Houyu was originally a hometown of overseas Chinese in northern Changle County, Fujian Province, and is now the Tenth Brigade of the Dongfeng People's Commune. Three canteens were set up on a trial basis in August, and in less than a month and a half, they leaped to become advanced canteens in the entire commune.
    The hygiene work of these three canteens is particularly good. They have already achieved: 1. The dining hall is swept three times a day and thoroughly cleaned once a week; 2. The shelves for bowls and plates, the large tables for distributing dishes, and the water tanks and chopstick holders are all covered with gauze curtains, gauze tents, or lids; 3. Kitchen utensils and dining hall tables and chairs are wiped clean every day and thoroughly cleaned once a week. Bowls, chopsticks, and cleaning cloths are frequently boiled for disinfection; 4. Cooks wear masks and aprons when working, wash their hands before and after work and after defecating and urinating, and do not use their hands to distribute dishes or rice; 5. Drinking water is managed, the cafeteria's well is used exclusively, and is managed by a dedicated person, who covers and locks it after use to maintain cleanliness and prevent sabotage by bad elements.
    In addition, the cooks also try every means to improve the health of the commune members. They select fresh vegetables and pay attention to preserving nutrients and palatable taste when cooking; meals are served on time to prevent commune members from being over-hungry or over-full. Ample boiled water is provided to prevent commune members from drinking raw water. Special, easily digestible foods are made for the elderly and children. Some cooks have also become hygiene propagandists, frequently promoting the benefits of hygiene to commune members. (Xu Wencai)

    猴屿食堂卫生搞得好
    到过猴屿的人，总要夸奖一声他们的食堂办得好。
    猴屿原来是福建省长乐县北部的一个侨乡，现在是东风人民公社的第十大队。8月间试办起三个食堂，在不到一个半月的时间内，就跃进为全公社的先进食堂。
    这三个食堂卫生工作做得特别好。他们已经做到：一、膳厅日扫三次，每周大扫除一次；二、放碗盘的橱架、分菜放菜的大桌以及水缸、筷筒等都分别罩上纱帘、纱帐或加盖；三、厨具和膳厅的桌椅等每日揩拭洁净，每周大清洗一次，碗、筷、揩布经常煮沸消毒；四、炊事员工作时戴口罩，穿围裙，工作前后和大、小便之后洗手，不用手分菜、分饭；五、饮水进行管理、食堂水井专用，由专人管理，用完加盖加锁，既保持清洁，又可防止坏分子破坏。
    此外，炊事员们还想方设法来增进社员的健康。他们选用新鲜的菜蔬，做饭时注意保存营养成分和味道适口；开饭定时，不使社员们过饥失饱。充分供应开水，不让社员喝生水。对老人和小孩就单做一些容易消化的食物。有的炊事员还成了卫生宣传员，经常向社员宣传讲卫生的好处。　（徐文彩）
