    Concentrating Manpower and Resources to Achieve Large-Scale High Yields
    Shunde County, Guangdong Province, Decides to Reduce Cultivated Land by More Than 100,000 Mu
    (Our Newspaper News) After initially combating the new right-leaning conservative thought on the labor force issue, the Shunde County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Guangdong Province has approved a plan to quadruple the yield of various crops next year by reducing the area of cultivated land.
    The Shunde County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held continuous meetings from the 16th to the 21st to study this year's production experience and formulate next year's production plan. The meeting was convened under the direct guidance of Zhao Ziyang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Qu Mengjue, Alternate Secretary Yin Linping, Secretary of the Discipline Inspection Commission Li Jianzhen and other comrades.
    Judging from the fact that this year's various cash crops and rice in Shunde County have leaped forward by one to three times, especially the large-scale high-yield fields and high-yield satellite fields, everyone believes that the potential of the land is still very great. However, some comrades believe that the labor problem cannot be solved if high production on a large scale is to be achieved. Because more than 400,000 laborers are needed for various crops, and the county has only 150,000 agricultural laborers, a difference of more than one time the current labour force. They believe that there is no way to find these laborers, so they lack confidence in the plan to build large-scale satellites.
    The meeting criticized this argument of "excessive labor shortage," pointing out that this year, merely due to the lack of experience in labor organization and command, the labor wasted on rework accounted for about 50% of the total labor, which shows that the labor potential is still very large. In particular, it should be seen that next year will be a year of large-scale production on the basis of communization, which is the most favorable condition for solving the problem of labor shortage.
    After criticism, those people's thinking became enlightened, and they had enough confidence in a greater leap forward next year. On this basis, a production plan for next year was formulated, requiring that 540,000 mu of the best cultivated land out of the total 710,000 mu of cultivated land be used to grow grain and cash crops, and the remaining land should be used to grow green manure and feed crops, implementing crop rotation, in order to concentrate manpower and material resources to increase the yield per unit area. The plan also made specific arrangements for increasing the production of various crops. (Yang Wenquan)

### 集中人力物力搞大面积丰产  广东顺德县决定缩小十多万亩耕地

    集中人力物力搞大面积丰产
    广东顺德县决定缩小十多万亩耕地
    本报讯　中共广东省顺德县委在初步反掉了对待劳动力问题上的新的右倾保守思想以后，通过了明年以缩小耕地面积，使各种农作物的产量翻几番的计划。
    中共顺德县委，从16日到21日连续集会，研究今年生产经验，制定明年生产规划。会议是在中共广东省委书记处书记赵紫阳、区梦觉，候补书记尹林平，监委书记李坚贞等同志的直接指导下召开的。
    从今年顺德县各种经济作物和水稻都跃进一倍到三倍的事实，特别是大面积丰产田和高产卫星田的事实看，大家认为土地的潜力还大得很。但是，有些同志认为要实现这样规模的大面积的高额丰产，劳动力问题没法解决。因为各种农作物共需要四十多万个劳动力，而全县只有十五万个农业劳动力，尚差一倍多。他们认为没有办法再找到这些劳动力，因而对搞大面积卫星的计划缺乏信心。
    会议批判了这种劳动力“过份紧张”的论调，指出今年仅仅由于劳动组织指挥无经验，而窝工返工所费的劳动力即占全部劳动量的50％左右，这说明劳动潜力还大得很。特别应该看到，明年是在公社化的基础上去进行大生产的，这是解决劳动力不足问题的最有利条件。
    经过批判，那些人的思想开朗了，对明年更大的跃进信心也足了。在此基础上，制定了明年的生产规划，要求明年在全部七十一万亩耕地中，以五十四万亩最好的耕地种植粮食和经济作物，其余的土地都用来种植绿肥和饲料作物，实行轮作，以便集中人力物力提高单位面积产量。规划还对各种作物的增产措施作了具体安排。　（杨文全）
