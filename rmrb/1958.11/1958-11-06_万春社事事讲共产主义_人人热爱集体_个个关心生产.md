    This newspaper reports: The Wanchun People's Commune in Wenjiang County, Sichuan Province, employs a variety of lively and effective forms to continuously conduct communist education for its members. As a result, the masses love the collective, care about production, and communist thought is continuously consolidated and promoted.
    After the establishment of the Wanchun Commune, with the universal implementation of organizational militarization, action combatization, and collectivized life, fundamental changes occurred in the relations of production and interpersonal relationships. These changes were actively supported by the vast majority of commune members. However, a few members felt less happy and accustomed to it. For example, after the canteens were set up, there was a shortage of vegetables, firewood, pots, and bowls, and some specific difficulties needed to be resolved urgently. However, some commune members were unwilling to invest their own firewood, vegetables, pots, and bowls in the commune.
    The commune party committee believed that only by firmly grasping the key of communist education can the communist thought of commune members be gradually promoted and consolidated, and can we effectively promote work, promote production, and consolidate the commune. Therefore, they first conducted comparative education on private ownership and public ownership through the commune's long-term plan. As a result, everyone realized that exploitation, poverty, and backwardness were all produced by private ownership, and private ownership was the source of all evil. At the same time, they also realized the benefits of public ownership, and that only by implementing public ownership can we move towards the happy road of common prosperity. After commune member Tian Hanqing recounted the suffering of private ownership, he saw that the public canteen had no firewood to cook rice, so he sent more than 2,000 catties of firewood from his own home to the canteen. He said, "If the commune is good, everyone is good. What does my little private property matter?" Secondly, communist education is permeated into daily production and life activities. For example, when implementing the half-supply and half-wage system, communist education was also carried out through the evaluation of grades, which greatly improved the consciousness of the masses and promoted production. Because the evaluation of wage grades is based on each person's labor intensity, technical level, communist consciousness and other conditions. The leadership firmly grasped this link, carried out mass criticism and self-criticism, which not only assessed the level, but was also equivalent to a ideological appraisal, so that each commune member once again received a profound communist education, and communist thought was greatly promoted. Commune member Li Guangfu of the Third Brigade, his labor and skills were the same as those of commune member Wang Qingyuan, but when the grades were assessed, Wang Qingyuan was rated as the highest grade - eight, because Wang Qingyuan had always been selfless and spared no effort in his work. Li Guangfu had more selfish thoughts in his work, and was only rated as seven. He happily accepted the opinions of the masses and immediately lent his family's five drying mats and a mixing bucket to the commune for use.
    Through the commune's continuous education in daily production and life activities, the commune members' love for the collective and the commune has greatly increased. The number of canteens in the whole commune quickly increased from more than 400 to more than 500, and the work of converting the whole commune's private pigs into shares at a fixed price was completed in just a few days. The enthusiasm of the commune members for production is also increasing. More than 40 old and weak commune members in the Fourteenth Production Brigade, who had not participated in labor in the past, resolutely demanded to participate in appropriate farm work. In half a month, the whole commune deep-plowed more than 30,000 mu of land, which was more than four times higher than last month, and the efficiency of harvesting late rice was more than doubled compared with the past.

### 万春社事事讲共产主义  人人热爱集体　个个关心生产

    万春社事事讲共产主义
    人人热爱集体　个个关心生产
    本报讯　四川温江县万春人民公社采用多种生动活泼的有效形式，对社员不断进行共产主义教育，因而，群众中人人热爱集体，个个关心生产，共产主义思想得到不断的巩固和发扬。
    万春公社建立后，随着组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化的普遍推行，在生产关系和人与人的关系上起了根本的变化。这种变化得到绝大多数社员的积极拥护，但是，也有少数社员感到不是那么愉快和习惯。如食堂办起后，没菜没柴，没锅没碗，一些具体困难亟需解决，可是有些社员就不愿意把自家的柴、菜、锅、碗投资到社。
    社党委认为，只有紧紧抓住共产主义教育这条纲，才能使社员的共产主义思想逐步发扬和巩固，才能有力地推动工作、促进生产和巩固公社。于是他们首先通过社的远景规划，进行私有制与公有制的对比教育。这样做的结果，人人认识到剥削、贫困、落后都是私有制产生的，私有制是万恶之源；同时也认识到公有制的好处，只有实行公有制才能走向共同富裕的幸福大道。社员田汉清在诉了私有制的苦以后，看到公共食堂没有柴火煮饭，就把自家的两千多斤柴送到食堂里，他说：“社好大家好，我这点私有财产又算得了什么。”其次，把共产主义教育渗透在日常生产和生活的活动中去。如在实行半供给制半工资制时，又通过评定级别进行共产主义教育，大大提高了群众的觉悟，推动了生产。因为工资级别的评定是根据每一个人的劳动强弱、技术高低、共产主义觉悟等条件进行的。领导上便紧紧抓住这一环，开展了群众性的批评与自我批评，既评了级别，也等于作了一次思想鉴定，使每个社员又一次地受到了深刻的共产主义教育，共产主义思想随之大大发扬。三大队社员李光福，论他的劳动力和技术都和社员王清元一样，可是评级时就是因为王清元一向大公无私、干活不遗余力，被评为最高级——八级，李光福做活私心较重，只被评为七级。他愉快地接受了群众意见，马上把自家的五床晒垫，一张拌桶借给社里使用。
    经过公社不断在日常的生产和生活活动中进行教育，社员热爱集体、热爱公社之风大大增长。全社食堂迅速由四百多个增加到五百多个，全社私猪折价入社工作几天就完成了。社员们的生产干劲也愈来愈大，十四生产大队就有四十多个过去不参加劳动的老弱社员坚决要求参加了适当农活。半月全社深翻地三万多亩，比上个月高四倍多，抢收晚稻效率比过去高一倍多。
