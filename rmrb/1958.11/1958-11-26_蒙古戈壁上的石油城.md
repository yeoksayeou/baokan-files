    Oil City on the Mongolian Gobi Desert
    By Our Correspondent Peng Fengye
    On the international train from Ulan Bator to Beijing, we shared a compartment with two Soviet comrades. One of them would be getting off at the same place as us – Sainshand, the capital of Dornogovi Province.
    When we got off at the brightly lit Sainshand station, it was still dark, and the Dornogovi provincial capital was still asleep.
    Leaving the train station, the car drove through the quiet streets, over a small hill, and soon onto the Gobi highway. The Gobi roadbed was smooth and solid, and the car drove quickly. The morning breeze was refreshing.
    In the distance, a cluster of firelight suddenly appeared, gradually approaching us. That was the East Bayan Oil Mine. The firelight was from the methane gas of the oil mine, which is said to burn year-round.
    We arrived at East Bayan ("Bayan" is Mongolian for abundance). The oil city in the Gobi Desert shone brightly in the morning light. The early shift workers were starting work, replacing the late shift workers. Children with schoolbags walked along the road towards the school.
    Oil Mine Director Barjiniyam received us in his office. When introducing the growth of the oil mine, he expressed his deep gratitude to the Soviet people for their help. He said that the Soviet people had established an oil mine for Mongolia in the harsh Gobi, and also helped to train technical personnel. Last year, according to the agreement between the Mongolian and Soviet governments, after the oil mine was handed over to Mongolia, the newly grown Mongolian oil workers, under the guidance of a few Soviet experts, managed the mine. The production tasks for the second half of last year were already overfulfilled, and the production tasks for the first three quarters of this year were also completed on schedule at 104%. Now the workers are engaged in a production competition, and are putting forward conditions to overfulfill the November targets.
    The car drove more than ten miles on the Gobi Desert. We came to the oil extraction plant construction site. On a vast expanse of land, there were hundreds of oil wells, each with a pumping unit working non-stop. The crude oil was pumped into storage tanks and then transported to the refinery through pipelines. The director of the oil extraction plant, Lobsang Tseren, told us that the pipelines are installed underground, like countless veins, connected together, hundreds of kilometers long. The average depth of the oil wells is 800 meters. If there is a malfunction, it can be repaired by machines.
    The first well installed in 1949 is also here. When Comrade Zengdedao led us to visit, he pointed to the sand under his feet and said that this area was the most desolate place in the Gobi Desert, never growing grass, and few camels used to come here. Now, it has truly become a "source of wealth" in the Gobi Desert.
    The underground oil deposit was discovered in 1937. At that time, crude oil seeped out of the ground, and the herdsmen used it as fuel. Later, after scientific analysis and research, it was determined to be an oil mine.
    In 1947, Soviet experts came here, set up tents in the Gobi Desert, and began drilling. In the spring, the strong wind stirred up flying sand, and people could not be seen across from you. In the rainy season, the ground was slippery and movement was very inconvenient. These difficulties did not scare people away. Finally, oil was extracted and refined here.
    This year, four new wells have been drilled. We visited a new well that was being installed with machinery. The iron tower was towering, and Mongolian workers, Soviet experts, and overseas Chinese workers were operating together.
    The director said that the two overseas Chinese workers, Bao Jinxi and Sodbu (Mongolian), who worked here are advanced workers in the oil extraction plant. Their advanced deeds have been put on the honor roll.
    There is a power plant and three oil refining workshops here. The power generation of the power plant not only meets the needs of the mine's production, but also supplies the electricity for the daily life of the East Bayan employees.
    The refinery processes crude oil into gasoline, diesel, and coke, with gasoline accounting for the largest proportion. According to the Three-Year Plan until 1960, the oil production of this mine will supply 50% of Mongolia's oil consumption. Now, not far from East Bayan, a petroleum exploration team from the Mongolian Ministry of Geology and Mining is conducting exploration work.
    The refinery was roaring with motors, and white smoke was constantly coming out of the chimneys. We saw the newly grown Mongolian oil workers skillfully managing the machines in the machine room.
    When we returned to the living and welfare area of ​​East Bayan, it was already late. The family members of the employees were going in and out of the shops, buying daily necessities. In front of the stationery counter in the store, we saw Chinese-made "Hero Gold Pens". Some time ago, a batch of Hero pens came to the Mongolian capital, but they were quickly sold out. These are newly arrived.
    The oil mine also equipped the employees with hospitals, schools, clubs, and nurseries. The children can live and study well, and the family members can devote themselves to production without any worries.
    Ten years ago, the site of this oil city was empty except for the Gobi Desert. Now, not only are there mines and welfare facilities, but also residences with an area of ​​more than 20,000 square meters. These buildings with modern facilities such as heating and water and electricity have formed several neat streets. People cheered for the rebirth and growth of the Gobi oil city, and a Gobi city with a population of several thousand has been added to the map of Mongolia.
    In a two-story building in the oil city, we visited the home of oil worker Burya. Burya was a herdsman when he was a child. Later, he worked in a coal mine. Now he is an advanced worker in the refinery.
    Burya's home is a two-room suite. His wife works in a nursery, and his youngest son is reviewing his homework in the outer room. The room was tidy and clean. Two white iron beds were covered with plush blankets. On the wooden cabinet opposite, there was a tablecloth and many daily necessities. A large mirror was placed on the top of the cabinet. He treated us with candy, apples, and also drank black tea.
    When talking about his family situation, he showed us a photo of his eldest daughter, a beautiful young girl, who is fifteen years old this year. After graduating from the seventh grade, she was sent to the Soviet Union to study handicraft technology. The photo was sent from Leningrad.
    He said that their couple's income is more than 1,000 tugriks (Mongolian currency), and the children's schooling is also at public expense, so their lives are very prosperous.
    We talked very harmoniously. He said that he had seen in the newspaper some time ago the news that the United States was provoking the Chinese people and that the Chinese people were fighting to liberate their territory of Taiwan. He and his comrades in the factory all expressed their support for the just struggle of the Chinese people. He said, "The cause of the Chinese people is our own cause."
    The host treated us warmly. After a while, he filled Mongolian white wine again, and asked us to toast together for the friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian people. More than an hour of conversation was full of the sincerity of the working class and overflowing with the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian people.
    "East Bayan", a new city in the Gobi Desert, may you prosper day by day! (Attached picture)

    蒙古戈壁上的石油城
    本报记者　彭逢烨
    在从乌兰巴托到北京的国际列车上，我们和两位苏联同志坐在车厢的一个房间里，其中的一位，将和我们在同一个地方——东戈壁省的省会赛音三达下车。
    当我们在电灯光照耀着的赛音三达车站下车的时候，天还没亮，东戈壁省会还在睡梦中。
    离开火车站，汽车穿过静寂的街道，翻过一个小丘，不久就开上戈壁大道了。戈壁的路基平稳、结实，汽车开得很快，晨风吹来，清新极了。
    远处，忽然出现了一团火光，逐渐地向我们靠近，那就是东白音石油矿。火光是石油矿的沼气，据说，沼气终年都在燃烧着。
    来到了东白音（“白音”是蒙语，富足的意思）。戈壁滩上的石油城在晨曦照耀下闪闪发光。早班工人开始上班了，他们去替换晚班工人。孩子们背着书包，沿着马路向学校走去。
    石油矿长巴尔吉尼雅木在他的办公室里接见了我们。他在向我们介绍石油矿的成长经过时，表示十分感谢苏联人民的帮助。他说，苏联人民在艰苦的戈壁上为蒙古建立了石油矿，又帮助培养了技术人才。去年，根据蒙、苏两国政府协定，把石油矿移交给蒙古后，在少数苏联专家的指导下，新成长的蒙古石油工人，把这个矿厂管理起来了。去年下半年的生产任务已经超额完成，今年头三个季度的生产任务，也按期完成了104％。现在工人们展开了生产竞赛，纷纷提出条件，要超额完成11月份的指标。
    汽车在戈壁上走了十多里，我们来到采油厂工地，一片广漠的土地上，分布着几百口油井，每个井上的抽油机不停地抽动着。原油被抽进贮油器里，再通过管道输向炼油厂去。采油厂的厂长罗布桑泽仁告诉我们，管道安装在地下，像无数条脉络，连接起来，有几百公里长。油井深度平均达八百公尺，如果出了故障，可以用机器检修。
    1949年安装的第一口井也在这里。曾德道同志领我们参观的时候，指着脚下的沙粒说，这一带，是戈壁上最荒凉的地方，从来不长草，以前连骆驼也很少到这里来。现在，它却名副其实的成为戈壁上的“富源”了。
    地下的石油矿是在1937年发现的。那时原油从地下浸透出来，牧民们曾把它拿去作燃料，以后，经过科学分析研究确定它是石油矿。
    1947年，苏联专家们来到这里，在戈壁上搭起帐篷，开始钻探。春天，大风卷起飞沙，对面看不见人影。雨季，地上泥滑，行动非常不便。这些困难，并没有把人吓倒，终究在这里采油、炼油了。
    今年，又新打了四个井。我们参观了一口新井，正在安装机器。铁塔高耸，蒙古工人、苏联专家和华侨工人们在一块操作着。
    厂长说，在这里工作的两名华侨工人包金喜和索德布（蒙古族），是采油厂的先进工人，他们的先进事迹已经上了光荣榜。
    这里有一个发电厂和三个炼油车间。电厂的发电量不仅满足了矿厂生产的需要，同时还供应东白音职工生活上的用电。
    炼油厂把原油加工成汽油、柴油和焦炭，其中，汽油的比重最大。根据到1960年的三年计划，这个矿的油产量将供应蒙古全国50％的用油量。现在，距离东白音不远，蒙古地质矿业部的一个石油勘探队，正在进行勘探工作。
    炼油厂里马达轰鸣，烟筒上经常冒着白烟。我们看到新成长起来的蒙古石油工人们，在机器房里很熟练地管理着机器。
    我们回到东白音的生活福利区时，已经向晚了。职工家属们在商店里进进出出，购买生活用品。我们在商店的文具柜前，看到了中国制的“英雄金笔”。前些时候，蒙古首都来过一批英雄笔，但很快就销售光了，这里的，是新来的。
    石油矿还为职工们设备了医院、学校、俱乐部和托儿所，小孩们都能很好生活和学习，家属们可以没有任何牵挂的投到生产中去。
    十年前，这个石油城的所在地，除了戈壁，便空无所有。现在，不仅已经有了矿厂、福利设备，还有二万多平方公尺面积的住宅。这些有暖气、水电等现代设备的建筑物，形成了几条整齐的大街。人们欢呼戈壁石油城的新生和成长，蒙古的地图上增加了一个有几千人口的戈壁城市。
    在石油城的一座两层楼房里，我们到石油工人布尔亚家里做客。布尔亚小时候是个牧民，以后曾到煤矿做工，现在是炼油厂的先进工人。
    布尔亚的家是一套两间，他的爱人在托儿所工作，小儿子在外屋温习功课。屋子里整齐、清洁，两张白铁床上铺着绒毯，对面的木柜上摆着台布和许多日用品，一面大镜放在柜台上端。他招待我们吃糖果、苹果，还喝了红茶。
    谈到他家庭的情况时，他把大女儿的照片拿给我们看，是一个漂亮的年青姑娘，今年十五岁，七年级毕业后便送到苏联学习手工业技术去了，像片是从列宁格勒寄来的。
    他说，他们夫妇两人收入一千多图格里克（蒙币），孩子们上学又是公费，生活很富裕。
    我们谈得很融洽。他说，前些天从报上看到了美国对中国人民进行挑衅和中国人民为解放领土台湾进行斗争的消息，他和厂里的工人同志们，都表示支持中国人民的正义斗争。他说，“中国人民的事业，就是我们自己的事业。”
    主人殷勤地招待我们，一会儿，又满斟蒙古白酒，要我们一同为中蒙人民的友谊干杯。一个多小时的谈话，充满了工人阶级的诚朴，洋溢着中蒙人民的兄弟情谊。
    “东白音”，戈壁上的新城，祝福你日益繁荣！（附图片）
