    Mobilizing the Masses to Educate Themselves
    Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department Deploys Communist Education Movement Work
    According to the Zhejiang Daily: The Propaganda Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a telephone conference on the 12th to summarize the experiences of the province's previous period of carrying out socialist and communist education movements, and to deploy further socialist and communist education movements.
    The meeting believed that since the end of August, the province's socialist and communist education movement has yielded great results. Through the education movement, the vast number of cadres and the masses have recognized the communist prospects, clarified the direction of their struggles, improved their communist consciousness, promoted the communist style and communist spirit of cooperation, and criticized capitalist, individualist, and departmentalist thoughts, which has powerfully promoted the people's commune movement, the current upsurge in industrial and agricultural production, and the development of various tasks.
    The main experiences of the previous period of the communist education movement are: First, it is necessary to strengthen the education of cadres and party members, so that they clearly recognize the current situation and tasks, clarify the future direction, consciously carry out self-education, improve communist consciousness, establish a firm communist worldview, and improve their awareness of carrying out communist education movements. Second, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, the entire Party should take action, the propaganda department should provide specific guidance, organize and train a powerful propaganda army, and use all propaganda tools and propaganda forms to carry out a massive propaganda movement to reach every household and deeply root in people's hearts. Third, the communist education movement must be closely integrated with the people's commune movement and the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and become a huge political driving force for promoting current production and various tasks. According to the experiences of Jiaxing, Jinhua, and other places, in terms of educational content, it is best to combine communist principles with the current work reality and ideological reality, and to link the great discussion of communist principles with the three-year plan to change the face of the region and unit, firmly establishing the idea of continuous revolution, continued hard work, and striving for high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production, and criticizing "tension theory," "conditionalism," and "skepticism." In terms of working methods, we must make all kinds of meetings for mobilizing and deploying industrial and agricultural production also meetings for conducting communist education; do what, debate what, produce while debating; and organize propaganda forces to go deep into the fields, stovesides, and construction sites. Fourth, the communist education movement is another profound ideological revolution, a more in-depth struggle on the political and ideological front to promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie. To this end, we must closely rely on the masses, mobilize the masses to educate themselves, and use the mass line method of great airing of views, great debates, big character posters, fully expose contradictions, organize debates, thoroughly destroy individualism, departmentalism, and capitalist ideas, and vigorously establish communist and collectivist ideas. Fifth, in the communist education movement, it is also necessary to pay attention to implementing the class line and conduct education in a targeted manner according to different objects and different characteristics. We must resolutely and promptly strike at the sabotage activities of class enemies.
    The main shortcomings and problems of the previous period of the socialist and communist education movement are: The development of the movement is not balanced enough, and some areas are not deep or thorough enough. In some places, not only were reports not organized among the masses and no airing of views and debates were carried out, but even general propaganda was insufficient. Some areas also had some one-sidedness in propaganda, for example, more propaganda was given to communist life, and less propaganda was given to accelerating socialist construction and establishing a communist labor attitude.
    The meeting believed that in order to further carry out the socialist and communist education movement in the future, the following issues must be grasped: First, the communist education movement must be closely combined with the current industrial and agricultural production and the ideological reality of cadres and the masses. In a period, we should grasp a central point, adopt the method of doing what and debating what, and solve the current prominent ideological problems and practical work problems. Second, an effective method for carrying out communist education for cadres and the masses is to seriously and specifically discuss and formulate a three-year plan for a county, a commune, or a unit to work hard and change its appearance, and establish the idea of continuous revolution, continued hard work, simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, comprehensive leap forward, self-reliance, and full cooperation. After the plan is formulated, it should be checked regularly, and the methods of comparing heights and lows, learning from the advanced, and finding reasons should be adopted to conduct vivid and concrete communist education. Third, adhere to the mass line method. This method is to fully utilize the methods of great airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters. In the debate, do not simplify, but present the facts and reason, and persuade, not suppress. Fourth, in order to make communist education regular and systematic, all localities must establish political work institutions and political work systems, and establish and improve various propaganda and education organizations (such as Party schools, Red and Expert schools, clubs, exhibition halls, etc.). At the same time, it is also necessary to study methods to combine education organizations with production organizations. Fifth, all localities should combine with the upcoming selection of socialist construction activists to launch a vigorous education movement among the masses to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced.
    The meeting was presided over by Sheng Hua, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee, and attended by the propaganda ministers of various cities and municipalities.

    发动群众自己教育自己
    浙江省委宣传部部署共产主义教育运动的工作
    据浙江日报消息：中共浙江省委宣传部在12日召开电话会议，总结前一时期全省开展社会主义和共产主义教育运动的经验，部署进一步开展社会主义和共产主义教育运动。
    会议认为，从8月下旬以来，全省社会主义和共产主义教育运动收获很大。通过教育运动，广大干部和群众认清了共产主义前景，明确了奋斗方向，提高了共产主义觉悟，发扬了共产主义风格和共产主义协作精神，批判了资本主义、个人主义、本位主义思想，有力地推动了人民公社化运动、当前工农业生产和各项工作的发展。
    前一时期共产主义教育运动的主要经验是：首先必须加强对干部、党员的教育，使他们明确认识目前形势和任务，明确前途方向，自觉地进行自我教育，提高共产主义觉悟，树立牢固的共产主义世界观，提高对开展共产主义教育运动的自觉性。第二，在党委统一领导下，全党动手，宣传部门具体指导，组织和训练强大的宣传大军，运用一切宣传工具和宣传形式，开展一个千军万马、声势浩大的宣传运动，达到家喻户晓，深入人心。第三，共产主义教育运动必须与人民公社化运动、工农业生产大跃进紧密结合起来，成为推动当前生产和各项工作的巨大的政治动力。根据嘉兴、金华等地经验，在教育内容上，最好把共产主义原理和当前工作实际、思想实际结合起来，把大讲共产主义原理与本地区、本单位苦战三年、改变面貌的规划联系起来，牢固地树立起不断革命、继续苦战、力争高速度地发展工农业生产的思想，批判“紧张论”“唯条件论”和“怀疑论”。在工作方法上，要使动员布置工农业生产的各种会议同时成为进行共产主义教育的会议；做什么、辩什么，边生产、边辩论；组织宣传力量深入到田间、炉边、工地。第四，共产主义教育运动是又一次深刻的思想革命，是一场政治、思想战线上更深入的兴无灭资的斗争。为此，必须紧紧地依靠群众，发动群众自己教育自己，运用大鸣、大放、大争、大辩、大字报的群众路线的方法，充分地暴露矛盾，组织辩论，大破个人主义、本位主义和资本主义思想，大立共产主义、集体主义思想。第五，在共产主义教育运动中，还必须注意贯彻阶级路线，根据不同对象、不同特点，有的放矢地进行教育。对于阶级敌人的破坏活动，一定要坚决地、及时地予以打击。
    前一时期的社会主义和共产主义教育运动的主要缺点和问题是：运动发展还不够平衡，部分地区存在不深、不透的情况。也有的地方不仅没有在群众中组织报告和开展鸣放辩论，就是一般的宣传也不够。有些地区在宣传中还存在一些片面性，例如对共产主义生活宣传得多，对于加速社会主义建设、树立共产主义的劳动态度等宣传得少。
    会议认为，今后进一步开展社会主义和共产主义教育运动，必须掌握以下问题：第一，共产主义教育运动必须密切结合当前工农业生产和干部、群众的思想实际进行。在一个时期应该抓住一个中心，采取做什么、辩什么的方法，解决当前突出的思想问题和实际工作问题。第二，对干部、群众进行共产主义教育的一种有效方法，是认真地、具体地讨论和制订一个县、一个公社、一个单位的苦战三年、改变面貌的规划，树立起不断革命、继续苦战、工农并举、全面跃进、自力更生、充分协作的思想。在规划制订以后，要定期检查，并采取比高低、学先进、找原因的方法，进行生动、具体的共产主义教育。第三，坚持群众路线的方法。这个方法就是充分运用大鸣大放、大争大辩、大字报的方法。在辩论中，不要简单化，要摆事实、讲道理，要说服，不要压服。第四，为了使共产主义教育经常化、系统化，各地必须把政治工作机构和政治工作制度建立起来，把各种宣传教育的组织（如党校、红专学校、俱乐部、展览馆等）建立和健全起来。同时，还必须研究使教育组织和生产组织结合起来的方法。第五，各地要结合即将开始的社会主义建设积极分子的评选工作，在群众中掀起一个轰轰烈烈地学先进、赶先进、超先进的教育运动。
    会议由中共浙江省委宣传部盛华副部长主持，参加会议的有各地市委宣传部长。
