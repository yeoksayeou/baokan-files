Running Schools by the Whole People, Flowers Blooming in the Garden
	-- A Visit to the "Exhibition of Combining Education with Productive Labor"

	Running Schools in the Style of Communism
	On a sign showing the development of education in the country, the number in front of the 1958 arrow is several times larger than the development numbers of previous years. The astonishing development of education this year is entirely a victory for the Party's mass line in education. Among the educational undertakings developed this year, the number of schools run by factories, agricultural cooperatives—people's communes alone exceeds the total number developed in the previous nine years. The Party's approach of "walking on two legs" in running education has achieved brilliant success.

	From many exhibits, it can be seen that the mass education movement under the leadership of the Party began with a communist style. The broad masses of people do not blindly believe in any "conditions." If they say they will run a school, the schools pop up like stars in the sky. In less than half a year, schools are everywhere in the country, and the sound of reading can be heard everywhere. From the introductions of the twenty-seven local pavilions, it can be seen that the speed of educational development this year is astonishing, whether in the mountains, on the plains, or even in the coastal areas threatened by the US-Chiang war. Many areas have not only popularized preschool, primary, and secondary education, but also established many universities. In the Jiangxi Pavilion, there is a map of Jiangxi Province, and the red stars representing Communist Labor Universities are truly scattered all over. These universities all implement a part-work, part-study system to cultivate new communist people who are both ideologically and physically red. In June of this year, Wencun Township in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, popularized university education. In addition to running Marxist-Leninist colleges, Iron and Steel Universities, Scientific and Technological Research Institutes, Communist Universities, and twelve universities of industry, agriculture, water conservancy, forestry, and medicine with various academic systems, the township also established many universal amateur Red and Expert universities. Exhibits from various regions prove that industrial and mining enterprises and agricultural cooperatives can run universities, and street neighborhoods, pastoral areas, and boat people can also run universities. According to the introduction in the national long-term plan, higher education will be popularized in this vast land of China in fifteen years, but in many regions of many provinces, this time has been greatly shortened. Seeing these exhibits, people feel delighted, and running universities and receiving university education are no longer mysterious things in our country today. The situation in which higher education is exclusively occupied by a few people will never return. The members of the Zhaoyuan People's Commune in Heilongjiang Province happily sang: "Clap our hands and laugh, take off the illiterate hat; teams run Red and Expert schools, everyone enters school. Primary schools do not leave the village, and young children are all educated; secondary schools are like stars in the sky, and universities are popularized. Communes run education, a complete set."

	The Whole People Run Schools, the Whole People Teach, the Whole People Learn
	Since this spring, the educational undertakings vigorously carried out by the mass movement under the leadership of the Party have formed a massive revolutionary movement of "the whole people run schools, the whole people teach, and the whole people learn." The schools run by various places include nurseries, primary schools, and various kinds of middle schools and universities. Some areas have also established integrated schools of various years, that is, studying from primary school or kindergarten all the way to university. The large-scale establishment of these schools enables the youth of our country to quickly enter school. Students who graduate from schools while studying and working are not only people with socialist consciousness and culture, but also laborers with productive skills. At the same time, the large-scale establishment of workers' spare-time schools and Red and Expert schools has made learning places available to almost all adults.

	After the basic realization of people's communes in rural areas across the country, some people's communes and some large factories have established complete education systems. A set of exhibits from the Xushui County People's Commune in Hebei Province introduces that the whole commune provides free full-time care for children, free enrollment and accommodation for primary schools, part-work and part-study for secondary and higher education, and implements "fourizations" and "four supplies." The fourizations are: organization militarization, action combatization, life collectivization, and thought communization. The four supplies are: full supply of clothing, food, housing, and learning expenses. This year, in addition to popularizing primary and secondary education, all literacy students in the county have entered spare-time Red and Expert schools for study. This year, the average person in the commune has more than 3,000 jin of grain, and industrial production has also developed rapidly. On this basis, they plan to turn all spare-time Red and Expert schools into part-work and part-study schools in the next two years, and popularize university education in 1963.

	In the factory-run school section of the Comprehensive Pavilion, it is introduced that many factories and enterprises across the country have established complete education systems. Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company in Shanxi Province has three lines—part-work and part-study, spare-time education, and general education—leading to higher education. They plan to have everyone in the company be a worker and a university student within five years. Now, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company has developed from four schools last year to fifty-four. These exhibits tell people that our factories and people's communes are cultivating new people who are both cultured and have labor skills while producing material products such as steel, machines, and grain.

	The masses in various places run schools in the spirit of making the best of simple conditions and pooling the wisdom and efforts of the masses. In the exhibition hall, there are many photos of men, women, old and young, in groups carrying tables, benches, leading cattle, and holding piglets. "What are these teams?" After reading the explanations next to the pictures, it is clear that they are "gift-giving teams," giving various supplies to private schools. Many private schools start from scratch, and the classrooms of these schools are very broad. Some places use workshops as classrooms and machine tools as desks; or hold classes in the fields, using crops as teaching materials; or use grasslands as classrooms and pastures as classrooms. There are also many schools that use production sites, ancestral halls, and temples as school buildings. Students of the Communist Labor University of Jiangxi Province cut down trees on barren mountains to make roof frames and pick up bamboo to use as tiles to build new-style school buildings. They find teachers without blindly believing in any "qualifications." Most schools take those who are capable as teachers. Those who serve as teachers in private schools include secretaries of Party committees at all levels, local experts and old workers and old peasants from all walks of life, as well as some professional and technical cadres, and many cadres sent to lower levels and cultural teachers.

	Cultivating New People Who Are "Both Ideologically and Physically Red"
	The schools run by the working people who are marching towards communism are closely combined with productive labor. Students in these schools study theory while engaging in practice. Most of these schools set up factories, farms, or pastures while building the schools. People who study here are students and also workers. The mining middle school run by Shanwang Township in Feidong County, Anhui Province, is completely combined with production such as learning and mining, iron smelting, farming, afforestation, and animal husbandry. In eighty days, it mined more than 8,000 tons of ore and smelted 65 tons of coke. The masses praised this school and said: Red flowers bloom in Shanwang Township, the mining middle school is established, the mining middle school cultivates all-rounders, good talents who are both workers and farmers.

	At the exhibition, people can see that many schools have undergone a complete change due to the resolute implementation of the Party's education policy. In the past, the Nanhua Motor Factory in Hengyang City, Hunan Province, ran technical schools that mainly focused on lectures. Generally, students could not operate after studying for two years. The part-work and part-study technical school established this year only takes half a year of study for 70% of the students to reach the level of a second-grade technician.

	The textbooks of private schools also have a unique style. The broad masses of working people compile textbooks, not blindly clinging to dogma by following in the footsteps of others, but teaching what is needed according to objective circumstances. Generally, agricultural technology courses in agricultural middle schools are taught according to the local production tasks and in seasonal order, so that students can use what they learn immediately. The masses are satisfied and say: "The season has not arrived, but agricultural knowledge is taught first." In the early stage of establishment, the textbooks of most schools combined politics, technology, and culture. Now, many places have added many courses based on the situation of people's communes running factories on a large scale. Generally, textbooks are compiled jointly by Party committees, local and foreign experts, and teachers. Most professional disciplines teach what is produced. The civic schools in Shangqiu City, Henan Province, are run jointly by schools and factories. In order to enable citizens to quickly carry out technical operations, they combine technical operations with language teaching. Such textbooks cannot be compiled while sitting in a college. It is the crystallization of the labor of productive laborers. In the exhibition hall, many such exhibits are displayed. Shanghai workers alone have compiled more than 1,000 sets of textbooks. Many of these textbooks are mimeographed, and even handwritten, but the content is simple and vivid, and can be directly used in actual production.

	The rapid development of cultural and educational undertakings has greatly promoted industrial and agricultural production and promoted technological innovation. In the Comprehensive Pavilion, there are crops cultivated by students of many Red and Expert schools in agricultural technology innovation, which are taller than the roof. Here, there are soybeans that are fifteen feet tall and yield 2,800 jin per mu, smoke trees that are fifteen feet tall and have 120 leaves per plant, and huge multi-spike sorghum that cannot lift their heads in the exhibition hall. They have to tilt their necks and look down at the audience on the roof. Here, there are also 1,000 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and 27,000 jin of millet per mu.... There are countless examples of workers promoting technological innovation and promoting production after learning culture. Every machine model and physical object exhibited in the exhibition hall contains the touching stories of workers' hard work and diligent study. Among the exhibits from Heilongjiang Province, a native machine tool unfolds such a vivid story in front of people: Liu Changrong, a fitter at the Heping Machine Manufacturing Factory in Qiqihar City, originally used manual operation to make diesel engine oil inlet drums. His hands were often bitten by pliers, and he could only make two a day, far behind the needs of production. Later, he participated in spare-time study. After wiping out illiteracy, he worked hard for twenty days and finally made his ideal native-made machine tool from waste materials. This machine tool can make an oil inlet drum in one second, and one day of production is equal to his past forty years of manual operation. Wang Haide, a worker at the Mudanjiang Rubber Factory, improved 60 machines in succession after learning culture, realizing full automation in the entire workshop.

	Walking into the exhibition room of the working people's intellectualization immediately gives people a sense of pride. Here are displayed poems created by workers and peasants. After reading these exhibits, there is a trend of "Li Bai becomes the past, and poetry heroes count today." Here, we also introduce writers, poets, scientists, philosophers, innovators, and inventors who have just become literate. Although there are not too many of them now, more people like them are growing rapidly. Before long, they will be the main members of the "family" ranks.

    全民办学　满园花开
    ——“教育与生产劳动相结合展览会”参观记
    本报记者　徐文
      以共产主义的风格办学
    在一块显示全国教育事业发展的牌子上，在1958年的箭头前面的数字比历年发展数要大好几倍。今年教育事业的惊人发展，完全是党在教育事业中的群众路线的胜利。在今年发展的教育事业中，单是工厂、农业社——人民公社办的学校，就超过前九年发展的总数。党用“两条腿走路”兴办教育事业，已经取得了辉煌的成就。
    从许多展品中看出，在党领导下的群众办学运动，一开始就是以共产主义的风格出现的。广大群众不迷信什么“条件”，说办，办的学校就像满天星。前后不到半年，全国到处都是学校，到处都是朗朗读书声。从二十七个地方馆的介绍看，无论是高山，是平原，甚至遭受美蒋战争威胁的沿海地区，今年教育事业发展的速度都很惊人。许多地区不仅普及了幼儿、小学和中学教育，还办了许多大学。在江西馆，有一块江西省的平面图，代表共产主义劳动大学的红星真是星罗棋布。这些大学都实行半工半读，培养思想劳动两头红的共产主义新人。河南登封县文村乡在今年6月间就普及了大学教育，全乡除办了各种学制的马克思列宁主义学院、钢铁大学、科学技术研究院、共产主义大学和工、农、水、林、医等十二个大学外，还办了许多全民性的业余红专大学。各个地区的展品证明：工矿、农业社能办大学，街道里弄、牧区、船民也都能办大学。在全国远景规划中介绍，在中国这个辽阔的土地上，十五年后要普及高等教育，但在许多省的许多地区，又把这个时间大大地缩短了。看了这些展品，令人心花怒放，办大学和受大学教育，在我们今天的国家里，再也不是什么神秘的事情了。高等教育为少数人独占的情况，将一去不复返了。黑龙江省肇源人民公社的社员高兴地唱道：“拍手哈哈笑，摘掉文盲帽；队队办红专，人人进学校。小学不出村，幼儿都受教；中学满天星，大学普及了。公社办教育，完整一大套。”
    全民办　全民教　全民学
    今春以来，在党领导下大搞群众运动兴办的教育事业，形成一个声势浩大的“全民办、全民教、全民学”的革命运动。各地办的学校，有托儿所、小学和各种各样的中学、大学，有的地区还办了各种年别的一贯制学校，即从小学或者幼儿一直读到大学。这些学校的大量兴办，使我国的青少年迅速地进入学校。在一边学习一边劳动的学校毕业的学生，既是一个有社会主义觉悟有文化的人，也是一位有生产本领的劳动者。同时，职工业余学校和红专学校的大量兴办，几乎使所有的成人都有了学习的场所。
    在全国农村基本实现人民公社化以后，有些人民公社和一些大厂，都建立了完整的教育体系。河北省徐水县人民公社的一套展品，介绍他们全社幼儿免费全托，小学免费入学住宿，中等以上的学校半工半读，并实行“四化”、“四供给”。四化是：组织军事化，行动战斗化，生活集体化，思想共产主义化。四供给是：衣、食、住和学习费用全供给。这个县今年除普及了中、小学教育外，扫除文盲的学员全部进了业余红专学校学习。今年，全社每人平均有粮食三千多斤，工业生产也迅速发展，在这基础上，他们计划在今后两年内，把业余红专学校全部转为半工半读，并在1963年普及大学教育。
    在综合馆的工厂办学部分，介绍全国许多工厂企业都建立了完整的教育体系。山西省太原钢铁公司分半工半读、业余教育和普通教育三根线，通向高等教育。他们计划五年内全公司人人是工人，人人是大学生。现在太原钢铁公司已从去年的四所学校，发展到五十四所。这些展品告诉人们，我们的工厂、人民公社在生产钢铁、机器、粮食等物质产品的同时，还在培养着有文化又有劳动本领的新人。
    各地群众办学，都是本着因陋就简的精神和群策群力办起来的。在展览馆，有很多照片拍着男女老少成群结队地搬桌子、掮板凳、牵耕牛、抱小猪等场面，“这是些什么队伍”？看了图旁的说明，才知道他们是“送礼队”，他们在给民办学校送各种用物。许多民办学校都是白手起家，这些学校的课堂非常广阔。有的地方把车间当课堂，机床做课桌；或在田头上课，以农作物作教材；或以草原为课堂，牧场作教室。还有许多学校以生产现场、祠堂庙宇做校舍。江西省共产主义劳动大学的学生们在荒山上，砍树做屋架，拾竹子当瓦片，盖成新型的校舍。他们物色教师，不迷信什么“资格”，多数学校以能者为师。担任民办学校教师的，有各级党委书记，有各行各业的土专家和老工人、老农民，以及一些专业技术干部，还有许多下放干部和文化教员等。
  培养“思想劳动两头红”的新人
    向共产主义迈进的劳动人民办的学校，是密切和生产劳动相结合的。这些学校的学生，一边学理论，一边进行实践。这些学校，多数在建校的同时就办起工厂，农场或者牧场。在这里学习的人是学生，也是劳动者。安徽省肥东县山王乡办的矿山中学，学习和开矿、炼铁、种田、造林、牧畜等生产完全结合起来，八十天就开采矿石八千多吨，炼焦六十五吨。群众赞扬这所学校说：山王乡里红花开，矿山中学办起来，矿中培养多面手，又工又农好人才。
    在展览会上，人们可以看到，许多学校由于坚决贯彻了党的教育方针，面貌焕然一新。湖南衡阳市南华电机厂过去开办以讲课为主的技术学校，一般学员学了两年还不能操作，今年办的半工半读的技工学校，才学半年，就有70％的学员达到二级技工水平。
    民办学校的教材，也是别具风格的。广大劳动群众编教材，不是踏着别人的脚印去死啃教条，而是根据客观情况，需要什么教什么。一般农业中学的农业技术课，都根据当地的生产任务，按季节顺序讲课，使学生学了马上能用。群众满意地说：“季节未到，农业知识先教。”创办初期，多数学校的教材都是政治、技术、文化三结合，现在许多地方根据人民公社大办工厂的情况，又增加了许多课程。教材一般是党委、土洋专家和教员共同合计编写。一些专业学科，多半是生产什么教什么。河南商丘市的市民学校，是学校和工厂一起办的，为了使市民很快能够进行技术操作，他们把技术操作和语文教学结合起来。这样的课本，坐在学院里是编不出来的，它是生产劳动者劳动的结晶。在展览馆，陈列着许多这样的展品，单上海市工人自编的教材，就有一千多套。这些教材，许多都是油印的，甚至还有手抄本，但其中的内容是朴素而生动的，能够直接用于生产实际。
    文化教育事业的飞跃发展，大大促进了工农生产和推动技术革新。在综合馆，有许多红专学校的学员，在农业技术革新中培植的作物，高接屋顶。这里，有一丈五尺高，亩产二千八百斤的大豆，有一丈五尺高，每棵一百二十个叶子的烟树，巨大的多穗高粱，在陈列室里抬不起头来，它们只好歪着脖颈在房顶上俯瞰观众。这里，还有亩产一千斤的皮棉，亩产二万七千斤的谷子……。工人学了文化，对推动技术革新和促进生产的事例，数不胜数，陈列室里展出的每件机器模型和实物，都包含了工人苦学苦钻的感人事迹。黑龙江省的展品中，有一架土机床在人们面前展开了这样一段生动的故事：齐齐哈尔市和平机器制造厂钳工刘长荣，原用手工操作做柴油机的进油桶，他的两只手经常被钳具咬破，一天只能做两只，远远赶不上生产的需要。以后，他就参加业余学习，扫除文盲以后，他苦战了二十天，终于用废料制成他所理想的土造机床。这台机床，一秒钟就能做一个进油桶，一天生产等于他过去手工操作四十年的工作量。牡丹江市橡胶一厂工人王海德，学了文化以后，连续改进了六十种机器，实现了全车间自动化。
    走进劳动人民知识化的陈列室，立刻给人一种扬眉吐气的感觉。这里展出了工农群众创作的诗歌，看了这些展品，大有“李白成过去，诗豪数今天”之势。这里，还介绍了脱盲不久的文学家、诗人、科学家、哲学家、革新者和发明家，他们现在的人数虽然还不太多，但是，更多的类似他们的人正在飞速地成长着，不要很久，他们就会是各“家”行列里的主要成员。
