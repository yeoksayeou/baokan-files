Xinhua News Agency report: Sideline production has developed rapidly in the Jiande, Ningbo, and Jinhua special districts of Zhejiang Province, greatly increasing the income of the communes.

	In the Jiande Special District, located in the Tianmu Mountains, more than 150,000 laborers are currently engaged in various sideline productions, with a daily sideline income of more than 500,000 yuan. The commune members are very happy, saying: After the establishment of the commune, industry, agriculture, and sideline production all achieved bumper harvests, it is "three stars shining brightly" and "triple happiness arriving at the door." In the Ningbo Special District, various sideline production professional teams consisting of 200,000 people are working day and night in the mountains and on the tidelands, engaging in various sideline productions. More than 1,000 types of sideline production are now active throughout the special district, and commune members are striving to increase the average income per household by 100 yuan before the Spring Festival. In the Jinhua Special District, the number of commune members engaged in sideline production in the Shanghua Commune of Lanxi County has increased from the original 200 to more than 1,000, with an increase in income of 120,000 yuan in one month. The commune has already taken out less than half of this cash income to pay the commune members one month's wages.

	The sideline production in the three special districts of Jiande, Ningbo, and Jinhua has been further developed after the Party Committee strengthened its leadership. The autumn harvest work in these three special districts has basically ended, and Party committees at all levels have taken measures to promptly develop sideline production. Jiande and Ningbo Special Districts and various counties have established sideline production offices. Most of the prefectural and county Party committees have a member specifically in charge of this work, and the People's Communes also have a deputy secretary of the Party committee or a deputy director of the commune specifically responsible for sideline production. After properly arranging labor, the People's Communes established permanent fixed professional teams, temporary professional teams, and shock teams for sideline production. At the same time, relevant financial and enterprise departments also vigorously supported the development of sideline production. The commercial departments in Ningbo Special District have added more than 80 purchasing points in the communes to facilitate the sale of products by commune members; the transportation departments have allocated more than 200 cargo ships and 6 trucks to transport products day and night; and the handicraft industry departments have also organized forces to provide on-site guidance. As a result, the development of sideline production has been greatly promoted.

    发展副业
    据新华社讯　浙江省建德、宁波、金华等专区副业生产发展很快，公社收入大大增加。
    在天目山区的建德专区，目前每天有十五万多劳动力投入各种副业生产，每天副业收入有五十多万元。社员们十分高兴，他们说：办公社以后工业、农业、副业三丰收，是“三星高照”、“三喜临门”。宁波专区由二十万人参加的各种副业生产专业队，正日夜在山上、海涂田里经营各种副业。全专区已有一千多种副业生产活跃起来，社员们争取在春节前按户计算每户平均增加收入一百元。金华专区的兰溪县上华公社从事副业生产的社员从原来的二百人增加到一千多人，一个月中增加收入十二万元，公社已拿出其中不到一半的现金收入给社员们发了一个月的工资。
    建德、宁波、金华三个专区的副业生产是在党委加强领导以后进一步开展起来的。这三个专区的秋收工作已经基本结束，各级党委都为及时开展副业生产采取了措施。建德、宁波专区和各县都成立了副业生产办公室，地委、县委大多有一个委员专管这一工作，人民公社也有一个党委副书记或副社长专门负责副业生产。各人民公社妥善安排劳力后，建立了副业生产的常年固定专业队，临时专业队和突击队等组织。同时有关的财经、企业部门也大力支援发展副业生产。宁波专区商业部门在公社增设了八十多个收购点，便利社员出售产品；交通部门调拨了二百多只货船和六辆汽车，日夜运送产品；手工业部门也组织力量巡回指导。因而大大促进了副业生产的发展。
