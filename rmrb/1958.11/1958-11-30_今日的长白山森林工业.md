Today's Changbai Mountain Forest Industry

    In the majestic Changbai Mountains, the primitive forest area is churning with leaping progress.

    On the Changbai Mountain forest logging sites, workers brave the severe cold and heavy snow, using chainsaws to intensely cut down trees in the continuous, thousand-mile-long forest. The chainsaws vibrate through the vast sea of trees, and tractors, cars, and forest trains travel day and night in the mountains and forests.

    The Changbai Mountain forest is a famous forest area in our country, containing a large amount of high-quality timber, including precious trees such as red pine, larch, yellow cork, ash, linden, and oak, which are unique to high-altitude mountain areas. In the past, Changbai Mountain forest logging relied on heavy manual labor, resulting in very low production efficiency. Loggers lived for many years in the long, sunless forests, living a very hard life. After liberation, thanks to the Party and the People's Government's attention to the forest industry and their concern for the labor and life of loggers, labor and living conditions have changed. Since the gradual implementation of mechanized forest logging in 1955, not only has production efficiency significantly improved, but the labor and living conditions of loggers have also been greatly improved. During this year's Great Leap Forward, all Changbai Mountain forest logging operation areas have formulated leap-forward production plans. Now, from felling, gathering, manufacturing, and transporting timber to loading vehicles, everything has been fully mechanized. In the logging operation areas, beautiful new forest villages have been built one after another. (Attached image)

    今日的长白山森林工业
    在巍峨壮丽的长白山，原始森林区在翻滚着跃进的浪涛。
    长白山森林采伐工地上，工人们冒着严寒大雪，在连绵千里的大森林里，用电锯紧张地在伐木，电锯震荡着茫茫的树海，拖拉机、汽车和森林火车日夜奔驰出没在山林间。
    长白山森林，是我国著名森林区，这里蕴藏着大量优质木材，有高寒山地特产的红松、落叶松、黄菠萝、水曲柳、椴、柞等珍贵树木。在过去的年代里，长白山的森林采伐，都是靠着笨重的体力劳动，生产效率很低，伐木工人长年生活在遮蔽天日的漫长的大森林里，生活很苦。解放后，由于党和人民政府对森林工业的重视，和对伐木工人劳动生活的关怀，劳动生活条件才有了改变。1955年森林采伐逐步实行机械化作业以后，不但生产效率显著提高，伐木工人的劳动生活条件也得到很大的改善。在今年大跃进中，长白山各个森林采伐作业区，都订出了跃进的生产计划。现在，从伐木、集材、造材、运材到装车，已全部机械化了。采伐作业区里，新建起了一座座美丽的新林村。（附图片）
