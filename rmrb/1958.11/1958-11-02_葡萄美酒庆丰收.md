Grape Wine Celebrates the Harvest
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Fruit Tree Research Institute, Li Yiyuan

I am not specifically here to encourage people to drink, but because the good news of grape harvests has been frequently reported recently, I can't help but think of grape wine. Did you know that the recent grape harvest record has reached more than 28,000 jin per mu? In previous years, the grape yield per mu was only over 1,000 jin. This year it has increased twenty-fold, and it cannot be said to be superfluous to drink to that alone!

Grapes are a fruit with high nutritional value, suitable for fresh consumption, and also suitable for processing into grape juice, raisins, candied fruit, and alcoholic beverages (wine, brandy, champagne, etc.). The nutritional value of wine is far higher than that of grain wine, and it is also commonly used in medicine as an aid to digestion and a treatment for anemia. Worldwide, the consumption of grapes is higher than that of citrus fruits and apples.

Wild grapes are native to Northwest, North, and Northeast China, and were used for food and ornamental purposes in ancient times, as recorded in ancient books such as the Zhouli and the Book of Songs. However, the cultivated grapes we have now were introduced by Zhang Qian from Dayuan (near present-day Tashkent, USSR) in the Western Regions during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. The "Qi Min Yao Shu" also states, "Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty sent Zhang Qian to Dayuan to obtain grape fruits and plant them all beside the detached palaces." Zhang Qian introduced the seeds, and after more than two thousand years of cultivation by the Chinese people, unique varieties such as Longan, Milk, and Chicken Heart have been formed in our country. The common characteristics of these varieties are strong tree growth, huge fruit spikes, and suitability for fresh consumption. Among them, Longan grapes are a high-yielding variety and are planted in the widest area.

Now, the Fruit Tree Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Sciences have also cultivated new grape varieties with high sugar content that can resist winter low temperatures and severe cold, which greatly saves labor for soil covering and cold protection in winter, which is of great significance in production. Secondly, in order to adapt to the large-scale development of grapes and accelerate the propagation of grape seedlings, the Fruit Tree Research Institute and the Shandong Grape Experimental Station have successfully experimented with propagation methods using single-bud or double-bud cuttings, which greatly improves the survival rate of grapes.

Grape wine making was also introduced after Zhang Qian's mission to the Western Regions. By the Tang Dynasty, the winemaking industry was very prosperous, and many poets wrote poems about wine, the most famous being Wang Han's "Liangzhou Ballad": "Grape wine in a luminous cup at night, I want to drink, but the pipa urges me on the horse..." However, we do not have many grape varieties. Thanks to the help of fraternal countries, the Hungarian people sent many grape varieties several years ago, and Soviet fruit tree experts also introduced some varieties suitable for cultivation in our country after visiting China; Romania and Bulgaria also sent us many varieties. Our country has introduced more than 100 grape varieties from the above-mentioned fraternal countries, and is now conducting trial plantings. In the near future, we will be able to taste more varieties of grapes and more varieties of fine wine.

### 葡萄美酒庆丰收

    葡萄美酒庆丰收
    中国农业科学院果树研究所　李翊远
    我不是特意来劝人喝酒的，只是因为近来葡萄丰收的捷报频传，不由得我不想到葡萄美酒这件事上去了。你可知道，近来葡萄的丰收纪录，已到二万八千多斤了。往年，葡萄亩产不过一千多斤。今年二十倍地增长了，单单为此来干它一杯，也不能说是多余的事啊！
    葡萄是营养价值较高的一种果品，适于生食，也适于加工制成葡萄汁、葡萄干、糖饯水果以及酒类（葡萄酒、白兰地、香槟酒等）。葡萄酒类的营养价值远高于粮食酒，而且在医疗上还常用作帮助消化和治疗贫血的辅助剂。在全世界，葡萄的消费量比柑橘，苹果还要多。
    我国西北、华北和东北原产野生葡萄，古时候供食用和观赏用，这在古书周礼和诗经上都有记载。但我国现在栽培种的葡萄却是汉武帝时候的张骞从西域的大宛国（今苏联的塔什干附近地区）引来的。“齐民要术”上也说，“汉武帝使张骞至大宛取葡萄实于离宫别馆旁尽种之”。张骞引进的是种子，经过我国人民两千多年的栽培，形成了我国特有的龙眼、牛奶、鸡心等品种。这些品种共同的特性是树的生长势很强、果穗巨大、大都适于生食等等。其中龙眼葡萄是一个丰产品种，种植地区最广。
    现在，中国农业科学院果树研究所和中国科学院也都已经培育出含糖量高的能抗冬季低温和严寒的葡萄新品种，这大大节约了冬季复土防寒的劳力，在生产上有很大意义。其次为了适应葡萄大面积的发展，加速葡萄苗木的繁殖，果树研究所和山东葡萄试验站试验成功了用单芽或双芽扦插的繁殖方法，使葡萄的成活率大大提高。
    葡萄酿酒也是从张骞通西域以后传入的，到唐朝时候酿酒业已很兴盛，许多诗人有咏葡萄酒的诗，著名的如王翰的凉州曲：“葡萄美酒夜光杯，欲饮琵琶马上催……。”但是，我们的葡萄品种还不多。感谢兄弟国家的帮助，匈牙利人民在好几年前就送来了不少葡萄品种，苏联果树专家来我国考察后也引来了某些适于我国栽培的品种；罗马尼亚和保加利亚也送给我国很多品种。我国已从上述几个兄弟国家引入了一百多个葡萄品种，现在正在进行试种。不久以后，我们就能尝到更多种类的葡萄，更多种类的美酒了。
