Editorial Notes:

    Industry Also Has a “Constitution”
    Agriculture has a “constitution,” and industry also has a “constitution.”

    The industrial “constitution” is a summary of experience in leading industrial production, and also a summary of mass movements in enterprises. “Two participations and one reform” in enterprises is an important part of this experience. As the movement deepens, this experience becomes richer and richer. Some people summarize this experience into seven characters: "Party, Handover, Big, Participation, Combination, Reform, Learn". "Party" means that all enterprises must carry out work under the leadership of the Party; "Handover" means handing over tasks and measures to the broad masses of workers and staff, pointing out difficulties, and proposing ways to overcome difficulties, so that everyone knows what's going on; "Big" means big airing of views, big contending, big-character posters, and big debates; "Participation" means cadres participating in production and workers participating in management; "Combination" means the three-way combination of workers, cadres, and technical personnel; "Reform" means paying attention to improving working methods and leadership style at any time and in any place; "Learn" means learning from advanced experiences and promoting advanced experiences. These seven characters summarize the important experiences of the enterprise production movement.

    The Qinghua and other factories have developed "two participations," which is a good thing worth advocating. The reason why it is good is that the practice of this factory is in line with the industrial "constitution."

### 工业也有“宪法”

    工业也有“宪法”
    农业有“宪法”，工业也有“宪法”。
    工业“宪法”是领导工业生产经验的总结，也是企业中群众运动的总结。企业中的“两参一改”就是经验的重要部分。随着运动的深入，这个经验愈来愈丰富，有人把这个经验归结为七个字：“党、交、大、参、结、改、学”。“党”，就是说，所有企业一定要在党的领导下进行工作；“交”，就是向广大职工交任务、交措施，并指出困难，提出克服困难的办法，让大家心中有数；“大”，就是大鸣大放大字报大辩论；“参”，就是干部参加生产，工人参加管理；“结”，就是工人、干部、技术人员三结合；“改”，就是要随时随地注意改进工作方法，改进领导作风；“学”，就是学习先进经验，推广先进经验。这七个字概括了企业生产运动的重要经验。
    庆华等厂发展了“两参”，是值得提倡的好事情。它之所以好，就在于这个厂的做法，是符合于工业“宪法”的。
