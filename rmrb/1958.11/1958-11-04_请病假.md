    Sick Leave
    Ren Shaosheng
    Xu Gang woke up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat. In the morning, he felt dizzy and his vision was blurred. His wife, Qi Xiaoying, a nurse at the Maternal and Child Health Hospital, touched his hot forehead and skillfully took his temperature.
    “Look at you, 38.6 degrees,” she said, looking at the thermometer, “Take a day off.”
    “What’s a little sickness like this?” Xu Gang patted his prominent chest and jumped out of bed as if nothing had happened.
    “But you have a fever. When you're sick, you should take leave.”
    “But I’m making steel, and we can’t be short one person at the open hearth furnace,” Xu Gang insisted.
    Qi Xiaoying naturally understood his feelings. This character, who used to work at the Tianjin Zhongxing Chemical Supplies Company before being sent down to the countryside, lazing around in the office all day, now had his heart turned red by molten steel. She had always been filled with joy at her husband's transformation. But today, with a nurse’s sense of responsibility to her patient, she wanted him to take a sick day.
    The young couple argued for a while, and Qi Xiaoying finally prevailed.
    The company's small steel plant had only been established for three months, and a telephone hadn't been installed yet. Coincidentally, today was Qi Xiaoying's day off from her shift at the hospital, so she decided to ride her bike to request the leave for him.
    Xu Gang paced around the room like a small ox-drawn waterwheel. At first, he was worried about whether the steel tapping would go smoothly today. Later, his entire mind shifted to waiting for Xiaoying to return.
    That's how it is when waiting for someone; the more you wait, the more anxious you become. Three hours passed, and Qi Xiaoying was still nowhere to be seen. Xu Gang waited anxiously, beginning to show signs of restlessness, staring blankly at the window one moment, and tapping the table with his fingers the next.
    “Why isn’t she back yet?” he sat down and said to himself.
    He waited until 3:00 PM, when he couldn't hold it in any longer. So, enduring his headache, he rode his bicycle and sped towards the steel plant.
    On both sides of the open hearth furnace hung two banners with white characters on red: one side read "Heroes Gather Before the Furnace," and the other read "Go All Out, No Hesitation." Seven or eight faces, red and black from the heat, were focused intently on the furnace. A short comrade was shoveling coking coal into the furnace with all his might.
    “What’s this? There's a new person today, but they're so thin and small, their physique isn't up to it,” Xu Gang thought to himself as he glanced over.
    He was just about to ask if Xiaoying had been there. Suddenly, the big guy, Xiao Liu, made a face at him. Xu Gang's mind raced, and he looked closely at the short comrade again. Ha! Wasn't this Xiaoying? She was wearing a set of black work clothes. The overly large willow hat covered all of her sideburns. Her eyes were hidden behind black glasses, and she was staring at the furnace opening with an air of importance, just like a veteran steelworker. Clearly, she didn't know he was standing behind her. Xu Gang was about to call her when suddenly, Xiao Liu roared at the top of his lungs: "Tapping the steel!" The glowing red molten steel surged out, making Xiaoying's face shine brightly, and beads of sweat dripped down her temples.
    Night fell, and Qi Xiaoying rode her bicycle with a relaxed expression. Xu Gang's bicycle followed closely behind her.
    "How is it, are you better?" Qi Xiaoying asked softly.
    "Hey, I got better while waiting," Xu Gang replied, sounding both happy and unhappy. "You went to ask for leave, how did you end up making steel?"
    "Didn't you say it yourself, we can't be short one person at the open hearth furnace?" she said with a smile.
    "Oh, so you were prepared," he said, his tone a little angry. After a pause, he added, "Why didn't you tell me? You made me worry for nothing. Would I have stopped you?"
    "I didn't really intend to make steel," Xiaoying said. "It was your good friend Xiao Liu. When he saw me, he shouted: 'What's up! Are you here to work for Xiao Xu?' I thought, that's right, didn't the Party Central Committee call on everyone to make steel? If you're sick, I can step up. So I said: 'Yes, Xiao Xu is sick today, I'm here.'"
    "Look at you, where did you get this energy?" Xu Gang interjected with a laugh.
    "Hey, they were thrilled when they heard that. Xiao Liu threw a set of worn-out work clothes in front of me, and I really got to work." Qi Xiaoying finished speaking, then licked her red lips with the tip of her tongue.
    "How is it, thirsty?" Xu Gang asked with concern.
    Walking into the bedroom, he immediately poured a glass of water for Xiaoying, but Xiaoying took out a pen.
    "What's up, are you still writing your reflections?"
    "That's right, I'm going to write a poem too," Xiaoying said as she wrote.
    Xu Gang snatched it to take a look. Ha, it really was a poem. The graceful handwriting wrote: Healthy human bodies, vigorous blood, Prosperous motherland, steel like the sea; I will use sweat to exchange for molten steel, To add a drop of red blood to the motherland.
    "You really can't leave your profession for even a moment, even your poem has the tone of a nurse," Xu Gang said with a laugh.
    He felt that Xiaoying's face was radiating an excited brilliance. He was also very happy, especially because she respected his beloved career. (Attached image)

    请病假
    任绍声
    徐岗半夜里出了一身冷汗，早晨觉得头晕眼花，他的爱人齐小影是个妇幼保健院的护士，摸摸他发烫的额角，娴熟地给他量了一下体温。
      “看你，三十八度六”她瞧着体温计说：“休息一天吧。”
      “这么一点小病算得了什么。”徐岗拍拍自己突出的前胸，若无其事地跳下了床。
      “可是你在发烧，生病嘛，总得请假。”
      “可是我在炼钢，平炉跟前是不能少一个人的。”徐岗坚持着。
    齐小影自然了解他底心情，这个下放前在天津中兴化学用品公司工作，整天在办公室里闲得吊儿郎当的角色，现在钢水已经把他的一颗心浸红了。对丈夫的转变，她的心灵深处一直充溢着喜悦。可是今天，她以一种护士对患者的责任感，要他请假休息。
    小夫妻俩咕噜一回，齐小影终于占了上风。
    公司的小钢厂才办起三个月，电话还没有装上。今天，碰巧是齐小影在医院里轮班休息的日子，她决定骑车去代他请假。
    徐岗在房间里像小牛车水似的团团转着，开始的时候，他惦念着今天出钢是否顺利，后来，他的全部精神都转移在等待小影回来了。
    等人就是这样，愈等心愈急；三个小时过去了，齐小影竟一去杳无影踪，徐岗焦急地等着，开始显出心神不定的样子，一回儿朝着窗口呆望，一回儿又用手指弹着桌子。
    “怎么还不回来呢？”他坐下，自言自语地说。
    一直等到下午三点钟，他实在憋不住了，于是他熬住了头痛骑上自行车，飞快地向钢厂蹬去。
    小平炉两边挂着二幅白纱红字大标语：一边是“英雄好汉集炉前”，另一边写着“鼓足干劲不含糊”。七、八张红里透黑的脸孔正全神贯注着平炉，一个矮小的同志使劲地向炉里送进一铲焦煤。
    “怎么，今天新来了一个人，可是又瘦又小，体格不行。”徐岗扫过一眼，心里这样想着。
    他正准备询问一下，小影是否来过。忽然大个子小刘朝他扮了个鬼脸，徐岗的脑筋一阵急转弯，再向这个矮小的伙伴定睛一瞧，哈！这不是小影吗？她穿着一身黑溜溜的工作服，过份宽大的柳条帽，把她所有的鬓发都罩住了，眼睛藏在黑色的镜片里面，正像一个老炼钢工人似的，煞有介事地注视着炉口。显然，她还不知道自己站在她的身后呢，徐岗正想叫她，突然，小刘壮着喉咙，大吼一声：“出钢了！”通红的钢水沸奔着，把小影的脸映得闪亮透光，汗珠顺着她的鬓际滴下来。
    夜色降临了，齐小影蹬着自行车，神态悠闲。徐岗的自行车紧跟着她。
      “怎么，你好了吗？”齐小影小声地问：
    “嗨，等也等好了。”徐岗回答道，像高兴又像不高兴的样子：“你去请假，怎么炼起钢来了。”
    “不是你自己说的吗，平炉跟前是不能少一个人。”她笑嘻嘻地说。
    “噢，那你是早有准备了”，听口气，他有点生气了，顿了一顿又说：“干吗不同我说一声，害我干着急，难道我会拦住你吗？”
    “我也不是诚心去炼钢的”。小影说：“是你那个好朋友小刘，他见着我就嚷：怎么啦！你是代小徐来上班的吗？我一想，对啊，党中央不是号召全民炼钢吗？你病了，我可以上阵，我就说：对，小徐今天有病，我来。”
    “看你，哪儿来的这股劲。”徐岗笑着插口道：
    “嗨，他们一听可乐啦，小刘把一套破工作服朝我前面一丢，我这就真的干起来啦。”齐小影说完，用舌尖吮了一下自己红红的嘴唇。
    “怎么样口渴了吧？”徐岗关心地问：
    走进卧房，他立刻给小影倒了一杯开水，但是小影却拿出了钢笔。
      “怎么啦，还写什么心得吗？”
    “对啦，还要做诗呢”小影一面说，一面写着。
    徐岗抢来一瞧，哈，真是诗呢，秀丽的笔迹这样写着：健康的人体血液旺盛，富强的祖国钢水似海；我要用汗珠换来钢水，给祖国增加一滴通红的血液。
      “真是三句不离本行，做诗也带着护士口气呢”，徐岗笑着说。
    他觉得小影的脸上正放射着兴奋的异彩，他也很高兴，特别使他高兴的是因为她尊重自己心爱的事业。（附图片）
