Xinhua News Agency, New York: According to TASS, on the 18th, the head of the Soviet delegation, Zorin, elaborated on the Soviet delegation's proposal on the peaceful use of outer space at the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly. Zorin's speech aroused great interest among UN personnel because many representatives believed that the Soviet Union's new proposal opened the way to achieving a mutually acceptable solution.

In his speech, Zorin pointed out that the United States is unwilling to discuss the military aspects of the use of outer space for two main reasons: First, US military bases in other countries are currently not only an important part of the US's entire military policy, but also an important tool for its political domination in many countries on various continents. The United States currently has 1,400 military bases established in other countries, and has invested heavily in the construction, equipment, and maintenance of these bases. The US government does not intend to abandon these bases. Second, the United States currently does not want to conclude an international agreement on prohibiting the use of outer space for military purposes and establishing international supervision of rockets, because the United States is now using its main strength to accelerate the manufacture of intercontinental ballistic missiles.

Zorin once again emphasized that the Soviet Union believes that it is extremely important to resolve the main issues concerning the prohibition of the use of outer space for military purposes and the abolition of foreign military bases on the territory of other countries, and the Soviet Union's proposals on this issue remain valid. However, the Soviet delegation must regretfully point out that the United States does not want to discuss and reach an agreement on this issue at this time.

Zorin said that in view of this situation, in order to bring the positions of the two sides closer and make it easier to reach an agreement, the Soviet delegation declared that it is willing to discuss and reach an agreement on even a smaller-scope issue concerning the peaceful use of outer space. However, on this issue, the United States has not gone any further than proposing a purely procedural proposal to establish a special committee.

The Soviet representative emphasized that the adoption of the Soviet proposal will ensure the establishment of a solid foundation for a permanent international organization for the study of the peaceful use of outer space.

Zorin finally expressed his hope that the drafters of the "Twenty-Nation" proposal could also show a flexible attitude like the Soviet delegation, put forward their revised proposals, and thereby reach an agreement with each other and formulate a unanimously agreed resolution on this issue.

After Zorin's speech, the representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom stated that they would carefully study the Soviet proposal and respond later.

    佐林在联大政委会上阐述苏联新提案
    斥美国阻挠和平利用宇宙空间
    苏联为使双方立场接近愿达成范围较小的协定
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：苏联代表团团长佐林18日在联合国大会政治委员会上阐述了苏联代表团提出的关于和平利用宇宙空间问题的提案。佐林的发言在联合国人士中引起了很大的兴趣，因为许多代表认为，苏联的新提案为取得互相能够接受的解决办法开辟了道路。
    佐林在发言中指出，美国不愿意讨论利用宇宙空间的军事方面，主要有两个原因：第一，美国在其他国家的军事基地目前不仅是美国全部军事政策的重要环节，而且也是它在各洲的许多国家中进行政治统治的重要工具。目前美国在其他国家建立了一千四百个军事基地，并且在这些基地的建设、装备和维护方面投下了大笔钱。美国政府不打算放弃这些基地。第二，目前美国根本不希望缔结关于禁止在军事方面利用宇宙空间和建立关于火箭的国际监督的国际协定，因为美国现在正把主要的力量用来加速制造洲际弹道导弹。
    佐林再一次强调说，苏联认为解决有关禁止利用宇宙空间于军事目的和取消在别国领土上的外国军事基地的主要问题，是极为重要的，苏联就这个问题提出的建议仍然有效。但是苏联代表团不得不遗憾地指出，美国现在不想就这个问题进行讨论和达成协议。
    佐林说，鉴于这种情况，苏联代表团为了使双方的立场能够接近和比较容易达成协议，声明自己愿意讨论和达成即使是范围比较窄小的、有关和平利用宇宙空间的问题的协议。但是在这个问题上，美国除了提出建立特别委员会这样一种纯粹是程序性的建议以外，没有再进一步。
    苏联代表强调说，通过苏联的提案将保证给研究和平利用宇宙空间的常设国际机构建立巩固的基础。
    佐林最后表示希望“二十国”提案起草人也能像苏联代表团那样表现出灵活的态度，提出自己修改后的提案，从而彼此达成协议，就这个问题制定出一项一致同意的决议。
    佐林发言后美英代表表示将对苏联的建议仔细研究后作出答复。
