Xinhua News Agency Report:

    The spring breeze sweeps across the grasslands, and people's communes are blossoming. Herdsmen in Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, and Gansu are happily establishing communes.

    This newspaper reports that in the vast pastoral areas of Qinghai Province, the Mongol, Tibetan, and other ethnic herdsmen, having just established pastoral cooperatives, immediately launched a high tide of establishing people's communes. From late August to the present, out of the twenty-five pastoral counties in the six autonomous prefectures of the pastoral areas, eighteen counties have already realized people's communization. The Haixi Mongol-Tibetan-Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture and the three Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures of Hainan, Haibei, and Huangnan have all realized people's communization; the herdsmen in the counties that have not yet realized communization are also actively brewing and discussing the matter.

    When the news of establishing people's communes reached the grasslands, the broad masses of herdsmen rejoiced and immediately wrote big-character posters and applications requesting to join the communes. At the time of the establishment of the people's communes, the herdsmen put on new clothes and hats, held high red flags, and joyfully beat drums and gongs, singing and dancing as they rushed to the meeting places to celebrate. They happily said: Pastoral cooperatives are like riding a骏马 (Junma - fine horse), and people's communes are like riding in a car, which will take us to communist society.

    The established people's communes have an average of four hundred and dozens of households of herdsmen and forty to sixty thousand head of livestock per commune. After realizing people's communization, the broad masses of herdsmen immediately implemented settled grazing, ending the nomadic life of moving with the water and grass for thousands of years. In the settlements surrounded by hundreds of tents, they established public canteens, nurseries, homes for the elderly, schools, medical rooms, supply and marketing stations, and other cultural, educational, and welfare facilities; at the same time, they established militia organizations, realizing the militarization of organization and the collectivization of life. Some people's communes have also implemented a semi-supply system of basic living materials, so that the tragic life of the herdsmen who had worried about food and clothing for many years has disappeared forever. Old herdsmen living in homes for the elderly have special people to deliver tea and meals, asking them about their well-being. Some elderly people take the initiative to talk to cadres, sincerely thanking Chairman Mao and the Communist Party for bringing them a happy old age.

    The establishment of people's communes in the pastoral areas has greatly promoted the leap forward in industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry in the pastoral areas. The eleven people's communes in Zeku County, unified the deployment of labor, and in a very short period of time, reclaimed more than 14,000 mu of wasteland, cut and stored more than 15 million jin of green and dry grass, built more than 1,400 sheds and pens, and repaired 23 canals, which can irrigate more than 1 million mu of grassland. After the establishment of the people's communes, Haixi has already established more than 500 large and small factories and mines.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, more than 300,000 herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, are advancing triumphantly along the road of people's communization. At present, ninety-three people's communes have been established on the vast grasslands, with more than 39,000 households joining the communes, accounting for 46.6% of the total number of herding households in the region. These communes are all integrated 苏木 (Sumu - township), commune, industry, agriculture (pastoral), commerce, education, and military. Another one hundred and seventy-two large pastoral cooperatives have already been set up and are preparing to establish communes.

    The emergence of the people's communization movement in the livestock areas of Inner Mongolia is the result of the great development of animal husbandry in the autonomous region under the leadership of the Party and the increasing socialist and communist ideology of herdsmen of all ethnic groups. From 1952, the herdsmen of the autonomous region began to try out pastoral cooperatives. After the great development in 1956 and the comprehensive consolidation last year, the livestock of the pastoral cooperatives grew several times faster than that of individual herding households every year. In July this year, the entire region realized pastoral cooperation, and the face of production and construction on the grasslands was completely new. Of the more than 1.7 million breeding female livestock of the right age in the region this year, more than 84% are now pregnant, which has never happened in history. The whole region has cut 6.2 billion jin of grass, more than double that of last year. More than 1.3 million improved sheep have been bred, and by the end of the year, it will be able to reach 3 million, which will be more than twenty times more than last year. This not only laid a material foundation for the high-speed development of animal husbandry, but also once again made the herdsmen of all ethnic groups appreciate the superiority of cooperation. In order to adapt to the needs of the great leap forward in production, the herdsmen on the grasslands are now going full speed ahead, enthusiastically demanding the establishment of people's communes in the pastoral areas.

    The first batch of people's communes in the livestock areas have now brought a scene of prosperity to the grasslands. Eighty-four communes have smelted iron for the first time on the grasslands. The twenty people's communes on the grasslands of Zhenglan Banner in Xilin Gol League have built more than 1,000 small factories for milk powder, fur, iron, and wood, and have established fourteen red and expert universities combining politics, culture, and technology on the basis of eliminating illiteracy. The vast majority of communes have established their own milk powder factories, sewing factories, veterinary stations, health clinics, and primary schools and nurseries. Some communes have also established scientific research offices (institutes), broadcasting stations, libraries, film projection teams, equestrian teams, song and dance troupes, clubs, and canteens.

    According to Gansu Daily, Sunan, Subei, Aksai, and Tianzhu, the four counties mainly engaged in animal husbandry production, realized people's communization at the end of October and the beginning of this month, respectively. So far, the red flags of people's communes have been planted throughout the vast pastoral areas of the province.

    With the establishment of people's communes, the living habits of the people in the pastoral areas have begun to undergo great changes. Public canteens have been generally established in Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County, and all meals have been implemented on a supply system. More than 160 public canteens have been established in Sunan Yugu Autonomous County. Most of the herdsmen who used to live scattered in the mountain valleys have gone to the canteens to eat, completely changing the backwardness of cooking with "three stones and a pot." Nurseries and clubs have been generally established on the grasslands, and the broad masses of women have also been liberated from the tedious housework.

    The establishment of people's communes has pushed livestock production and various tasks in the pastoral areas to a new climax. After the realization of people's communization in Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, there is a new atmosphere everywhere. More than 60,000 new local factories, mines, and workshops have been built in the prefecture, including more than 4,000 backbone factories and mines. Schools and nurseries have been universally established. A high tide of eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene has also emerged. Aksai Kazakh Autonomous County proposed to ensure that livestock safely pass through the winter and spring, without losing a single head of livestock, and that breeding female livestock reach full mating and full pregnancy, and achieve self-sufficiency in feed and fodder next year. In addition, they also organized a field professional team to ensure that 500,000 jin of meat are hunted within the year. This county originally had no iron smelting task, but after realizing people's communization, it automatically proposed to smelt 50 tons of iron within this year. Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County has greatly strengthened ethnic unity through the establishment of people's communes. More than 340,000 mu of crops in the county were all transported to the threshing ground within five days, and it was proposed to thresh, store, and hand in public grain quickly, changing the habit of harvesting in September and threshing in December in previous years. On the day when the county realized communization (5th), the county's coal production released a satellite of 80,000 tons per day. After the people's communization, Subei Mongol Autonomous County organized a labor army of 160 people and a transportation team of 200 camels to engage in iron and steel production, deep plowing, receiving winter lambs, and protecting livestock through the winter.

    春风吹遍草原　人民公社花开
    青海、内蒙古、甘肃牧民欢欢喜喜办公社
    本报讯　青海省广大牧业区的蒙、藏等族牧民群众，在刚成立牧业合作社不久，紧接着又掀起了一个大办人民公社的高潮。从8月下旬开始到现在，牧业区六个自治州的二十五个牧业县，已经有十八个县实现了人民公社化。海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州和海南、海北、黄南三个藏族自治州全部实现了人民公社化；还没有实现公社化的县，牧民群众也正在积极地酝酿讨论。
    当举办人民公社的消息传到草原以后，广大牧民欢欣鼓舞，立刻写大字报、申请书要求加入公社。在人民公社成立的时候，牧民们穿戴上新衣新帽，高举红旗，敲锣打鼓，载歌载舞地赶到会场去庆祝。他们高兴地说：牧业社好比骑上骏马，人民公社好像坐上了汽车，它会把我们带到共产主义社会。
    已经建立起来的人民公社，平均每社有四百几十户牧民和四万到六万头牲畜。广大牧民群众在实现人民公社化以后，立即实行定居放牧，结束了几千年来逐水草而居的游牧生活。他们在成百顶帐房围拢起来的定居点上，举办了公共食堂、托儿所、幸福院、学校、医疗室、供销站等文化教育和生活福利设施；同时建立起民兵组织，实现了组织军事化、生活集体化。有的人民公社还实行了基本生活资料半供给制，使牧民群众多少年来愁吃愁穿的悲惨生活一去不返。生活在幸福院里的老牧民们，专门有人送茶送饭，问寒问暖。有些老人主动找干部谈话，衷心感谢毛主席和共产党给他们带来的幸福晚年。
    牧业区人民公社的建立，大大促进了牧业区工、农、牧业生产的跃进。泽库县的十一个人民公社，统一调配了劳力，在很短的时间内开荒一万四千多亩，割贮青干草一千五百多万斤，修棚搭圈一千四百多个，修水渠二十三条，可灌溉草原一百多万亩。海西在成立人民公社以后，已经举办起大小厂矿五百多个。
    据新华社讯　内蒙古自治区三十多万各民族牧民，在党的社会主义建设总路线光辉照耀下，正沿着人民公社化的道路高歌猛进。目前，在广阔的草原上已经建立起九十三个人民公社，加入公社的有三万九千多户，占全区总牧户的46.6％，这些公社都是苏木（区）、社合一，工农（牧）商学兵五位一体的。还有一百七十二个大牧业社已经搭架，准备建立公社。
    内蒙古畜牧区人民公社化运动的出现，是在党的领导下，自治区牧业大发展，各族牧民社会主义和共产主义思想日益高涨的结果。从1952年，自治区牧民就开始试办牧业社，经过1956年的大发展和去年的全面巩固，牧业社的牲畜每年都比个体牧户增长一倍到几倍。今年7月间全区实现了牧业合作化，草原上的生产建设面貌焕然一新。今年全区的一百七十多万头适龄大母畜中，现在84％以上都受胎怀孕，这是历史上从来没有过的；全区已打草六十二亿斤，比去年增长一倍多；改良绵羊一百三十多万只，到年底能够达到三百万只，将比去年增加二十多倍。这不仅给畜牧业的高速度发展奠定了物质基础，而且又一次使各民族牧民体会到合作化的优越性。为了适应生产大跃进的需要，草原上的牧民现在又快马加鞭，热烈要求在牧区建立人民公社。
    畜牧区的第一批人民公社，现在已经给草原上带来了一片繁荣景象。有八十四个公社在草原上第一次炼出了铁。锡林郭勒盟正蓝旗草原上的二十个人民公社，已经兴建起一千多座乳粉、皮毛、铁木等小型工厂，并且在扫除文盲的基础上建立了政治、文化、技术三结合的红专大学十四所。绝大部分公社都建立了自己的乳粉厂、缝纫厂、兽医站、卫生所和小学、托儿所。部分公社还成立了科学研究室（所）、广播站、图书室、电影放映队、马技队、歌舞剧团、俱乐部和食堂。
    据甘肃日报消息　肃南、肃北、阿克塞、天祝等四个以畜牧业生产为主的县，分别于10月底和本月初实现了人民公社化。至此，全省广大牧区，插遍了人民公社的红旗。
    随着人民公社的建立，牧区人民的生活习惯开始起了很大的变化。天祝藏族自治县已经普遍建立了公共食堂，并且吃饭已全部实行供给制。肃南裕固族自治县已建立公共食堂一百六十多个，一向分散居住在山沟里的牧民，大都到食堂里吃饭，彻底改变了做饭“三石一顶锅”的落后面貌。托儿所、俱乐部在草原上普遍建立起来了，广大的妇女也从繁琐的家务劳动中解放了出来。
    人民公社的建立，把牧区的畜牧业生产及各项工作推向一个新的高潮。甘南藏族自治州在实现人民公社化后，到处是一片新气象。全州新建地方厂矿作坊六万多个，其中骨干厂矿四千多个。学校、托儿所已普遍办起来；除四害、讲卫生也出现了高潮。阿克塞哈萨克族自治县提出保证牧畜安全渡过冬春，不损失一头牧畜，适龄母畜达到全配全怀，明年做到饲料饲草自给。另外，他们还组织了一个野外专业队，保证年内打猎肉五十万斤。这个县本来没有炼铁任务，在实现人民公社化后，自动提出要在今年内炼铁五十吨。天祝藏族自治县通过建立人民公社，大大加强了民族团结，全县三十四万多亩庄稼，在五天内就全部运上场，并且提出要快打、快藏、快交公粮，改变了往年9月收秋腊月打场的习惯。在全县实现公社化的这一天（5日），全县的煤炭生产放出了日产八万吨的卫星。肃北蒙古族自治县在人民公社化后，组织了一百六十人的劳动大军和二百峰骆驼的运输大队，从事钢铁生产、深翻地、接冬羔、保畜过冬等各项工作。（附图片）
