Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 10th—The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently convened an on-site conference in Yunnan on indigenous copper smelting. The conference determined that a large-scale mass movement of indigenous copper smelting must be launched immediately across the country to meet the urgent need for copper in the country's high-speed industrial construction.

The conference believed that with the rapid development of socialist industry and agriculture, the insufficient production of copper has become the most prominent problem in the current national construction. If this problem is not resolved well, it will inevitably affect the speed of our country's socialist construction. The conference pointed out that in recent months, the copper smelting industry in many provinces and autonomous regions has developed, and copper production has achieved rapid growth. More and more people across the country have realized the importance of increasing copper production. However, at present, many regions have not yet truly formed a mass movement of the whole Party and the whole people to engage in the copper smelting industry, and copper production is still far from meeting the urgent needs of the current national construction.

Based on the above situation, the representatives attending the meeting focused on studying how to launch a mass movement of indigenous copper smelting by the whole Party and the whole people in the future, and how to implement the "small, indigenous, and mass" policy in the copper smelting industry. At the meeting, Ma Jikong, Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee, the CPC Chuxiong Prefectural Committee, the Huize County Committee, and the Mouding Copper Mine Party Committee, respectively introduced their experiences on how to achieve political command, have the secretaries take action, implement the "small, indigenous, and mass" policy in the copper smelting industry, and launch a mass movement of indigenous copper smelting. More than two hundred representatives from twenty-eight provinces and cities attending the meeting expressed great interest in Yunnan Province's experience in copper smelting by the whole people. In August this year, the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee resolutely implemented the central government's instructions, organized 100,000 people to go to the mountains to mine and smelt copper, and elevated copper to the position of "deputy commander." Subsequently, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council and the spirit of the Beidaihe Central Political Bureau meeting, it further proposed the policy of "simultaneous steel and copper production" and made a resolution at the provincial Party Congress to develop the copper smelting industry. At the same time, through extensive and in-depth political and ideological work and propaganda and mobilization work, the political and economic significance of the great battle for steel and copper was made known to every household. By October, the province's copper smelting team had reached more than one million people, releasing the first high-yield satellite with a daily output of 318 tons of crude copper, and many copper smelting enterprises with more than 10,000 people started from scratch. At the meeting, the representatives criticized the erroneous view of attaching importance to foreign methods and slighting indigenous methods in the copper smelting industry, the so-called "inability to work without machinery." The representatives unanimously believed that the focus in the future should be from small to large, from indigenous to foreign, and first of all, indigenous methods should be adopted to launch a large-scale on-site training movement, concentrate the wisdom of the masses, launch a technological innovation movement, and break through technological barriers, so as to create a new situation in which the majority of people smelt copper and the copper smelting industry blossoms everywhere. Some large and medium-sized copper mines that are under basic construction must also adopt the method of combining basic construction with organizing indigenous production, so as to achieve both basic construction and production.

The conference finally pointed out that in order to achieve a greater leap forward in copper production next year, all localities must start early and do everything possible to strive to complete this year's production tasks, and strive to break through technological barriers this year, so as to prepare ideological, organizational, and technical work for welcoming a nationwide copper smelting upsurge with ten thousand horses galloping forward.

    满足高速度发展工业建设的迫切需要
    掀起群众性土法炼铜运动
    二十八个省市代表在云南举行现场会议
    新华社昆明10日电　冶金工业部最近在云南召开了土法炼铜现场会议。会议确定，必须立即在全国范围内掀起大规模的群众性土法炼铜运动，以满足国家高速度工业建设对铜的迫切需要。
    会议认为，随着社会主义工农业突飞猛进的发展，铜的生产的不足已经成为当前国家建设中一个最突出的问题。如果这个问题不很好解决，必将影响我国社会主义建设的发展速度。会议指出，最近几个月来，不少省、自治区的炼铜工业有了发展，铜的生产获得了迅速的增长，全国已经有越来越多的人认识到增加铜的生产的重要意义。但是，目前许多地区还没有真正形成全党全民大搞炼铜工业的群众运动，铜的生产同当前国家建设的迫切需要，仍然脱离很远。
    到会代表们根据上述情况，对今后如何掀起全党全民的群众性土法炼铜运动，以及在炼铜工业中贯彻“小、土、群”的方针问题着重进行了研究。会上，中共云南省委书记马继孔、中共楚雄地委、会泽县委和牟定铜矿党委，分别就怎样做到政治挂帅、书记动手，在炼铜工业中贯彻“小、土、群”方针，掀起群众性土法炼铜运动的经验，作了介绍。到会的二十八个省市的二百多个代表，对云南省全民炼铜的经验感到极大的兴趣。今年8月份，中共云南省委就坚决贯彻中央的指示，组织十万人上山开矿炼铜，把铜举为“副帅”。接着，又根据党中央、国务院的指示和北戴河中央政治局会议决议的精神，进一步提出了“钢铜并举”的方针，在省党代表大会上作出了发展炼铜工业的决议。同时，通过广泛深入的政治思想工作和宣传鼓动工作，使大战钢铁铜的政治经济意义作到家喻户晓。到10月份，全省的炼铜队伍已经达到一百多万人，放出了日产粗铜三百一十八吨的第一颗高产卫星，出现了许多白手起家，万人以上的炼铜企业。会上，代表们批判了在炼铜工业中重洋轻土的所谓“离开机械不能干”的错误看法。代表们一致认为，今后的重点应当是由小到大，由土到洋，首先应当土法上马，展开大规模的现场炼兵运动，集中群众的智慧，展开技术革新运动，突破技术关，以造成一个多数人炼铜、炼铜工业遍地开花的新形势。某些正在进行基本建设的大、中型铜矿，也必须采取边基建边组织土法生产的办法，做到土洋并举，争取基建生产双丰收。
    会议最后指出，为了实现明年铜的生产更大的跃进，各地必须及早动手，千方百计地争取完成今年的生产任务，力争今年突破技术关，为迎接一个万马奔腾的全民炼铜高潮，做好思想、组织和技术准备工作。
