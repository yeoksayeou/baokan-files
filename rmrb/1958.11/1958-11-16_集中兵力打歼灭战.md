Concentrate Forces to Fight Annihilation Warfare
Dong Wenxing, Director of Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau

Under the direct leadership of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, Beijing's construction enterprises, with rapid construction as the guiding principle, launched a massive mass movement. In the forty days from August 20th to September 30th, they launched more than sixty large and small "satellite" projects of rapid construction. The completed area reached 1.89 million square meters, equivalent to the total amount completed from January to July this year, and 2.7 times higher than the same period last year. Such a rapid construction speed is unprecedented in the history of Beijing's construction.

The primary reason we were able to achieve such great results in this rapid construction effort was the serious work we put into ranking the engineering projects. In the ranking process, there were two opposing approaches and two different methods. One method was to divide forces and spread them out, advancing on all fronts, fighting a war of attrition, and scattering limited manpower and materials like "pepper flakes." The result would inevitably be that old projects could not be completed, and new projects could not be started. In particular, projects with political significance and "vanguard" projects were in danger of being squeezed out. The other method was to concentrate forces, shorten the battle lines, focus on key projects, fight battles of annihilation and quick decisions, and use limited manpower and materials in the most important and effective areas. We would complete one project, then move on to the next, complete one batch, then move on to the next. Only in this way could key projects be rapidly advanced, which in turn would create conditions for other projects. This is a method of "one horse leading the way, ten thousand horses galloping," which fully complies with the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Our specific arrangement method was: first, to focus on industrial construction and important political buildings, while also taking into account other urgent needs. Among the key projects, we first arranged the main buildings. Second, in combination with concentrated efforts, we strived to shorten the battle lines. For those projects that were mostly completed, regardless of their importance or size, we tried to complete them as soon as possible and put them into production or use, increasing the finished product rate. Third, instead of determining output based on materials, we consciously arranged more projects to bring in all positive factors and potential, striving to complete more construction area. Fourth, for general projects that had already completed the foundation and were entering the structure phase, the vast majority continued construction; a small number of less important projects that consumed too much steel and cement were generally suspended until the supply of steel and cement was obtained before continuing construction. Fifth, in conjunction with the Housing Management Bureau, we tried to find ways to solve the housing difficulties of units whose projects had been reduced, postponed, or suspended.

The overall arrangement of construction tasks was the result of ideological struggle. Here, there was a struggle between the overall view and the partial view; a struggle between the spirit of communist cooperation and departmentalism; and also a struggle between averaging the use of forces based on taking care of emotions and relationships and focusing on the speed of socialist construction and concentrating efforts. Because under the direct leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, cadres were clearly presented with the following views: only by not doing some things can we do other things; where there is a vanguard, there must be a rearguard; where there are key points, there must be less important points; where there is speed, there must be slowness. After these views were clarified, various difficulties were eliminated, and the ranking work could proceed smoothly. Such ranking is active and completely different from the previous simple determination of output based on materials. In the Great Leap Forward, we deeply realized that it created extremely favorable conditions for organizing rapid construction, enabling us to initially break away from the original passive and chaotic situation.

The reason why this rapid construction was able to far exceed previous production campaigns, in addition to the necessary technical measures we adopted, the most important and fundamental reason was to put politics in command, making rapid construction a large-scale mass movement. Rapid construction must fully mobilize the masses and rely on the masses. The most basic methods are to fully air views, contend, debate, and write big-character posters. Whether it was formulating plans, studying construction technical measures, studying operating methods, or even fighting against right-leaning conservative ideas, we solved problems everywhere through the masses and relying on the masses. For example, when the leap forward plan to complete more than 1.8 million square meters in forty days was first proposed, some leading comrades lacked confidence and were not sure. But once the masses discussed it, it was the opposite. They were full of fighting spirit and soaring enthusiasm, proposing: "Turn stars into moons, turn moons into suns, and do not leave the battlefield until the task is completed." This changed the understanding of some leading cadres.

Because the masses were fully mobilized and rapid construction was carried out on a large scale, productivity was greatly developed, which caused profound changes within the construction enterprise. In terms of the organization and management of the enterprise, many outdated rules and regulations were broken, negated, and abolished, and new management methods that were in line with the development of productive forces grew. In construction preparation, the one-sided emphasis on "three no-starts" (no start without a contract budget, no start without complete drawings, no start without complete construction preparation) was negated, and it was changed to the "three-simultaneous" method of simultaneous design, simultaneous construction, and simultaneous material preparation according to objective requirements. In planning work, it was no longer a matter of closing the door and letting technicians compile it alone; instead, the leadership first put forward the overall planning requirements, handed them over to the masses for discussion and supplementation, affirmed the construction technical measures, and then turned them into specific construction plans, which were implemented among the masses. The issuance and discussion of plans also took the form of mass movements, holding on-site skill competitions, writing big-character posters, and posting guarantees, turning abstract plans into concrete actions of determination by the masses. In addition, technical management systems, statistical work, and financial budget work have also been greatly simplified. In financial work, the method of using tables instead of accounts was universally implemented, and methods such as "rapid budget," "rapid cost," and "rapid settlement" were created.

Under rapid construction, leaders must go deep into the front lines, work shifts, share weal and woe with the masses, understand the masses, be familiar with production, and learn from the masses, and then in turn lead the masses and direct production. In this way, the three bad work styles and five airs can be effectively overcome.

Now, the mass movement in our bureau with rapid construction as the guiding principle is further developing. The current central issue is to make rapid construction a normal construction method for construction enterprises in the future based on the initial experience gained. This requires the universal promotion of the various basic measures of rapid construction so that the majority of workers can skillfully master and continue to develop them. At the same time, it is also necessary to carry out systematic reforms in organization, systems, etc., as soon as possible to adapt to rapid construction and large-scale mass movements.

    集中兵力打歼灭战
    北京市建筑工程局局长　董文兴
    北京市建筑企业，在市委的直接领导下，以快速施工为纲，大搞群众运动，从8月20日到9月30日的四十天中，放出快速施工的大、小卫星六十多颗。竣工面积达一百八十九万平方公尺，等于今年1至7月完成计划的总和，比去年同期提高了二·七倍。这样快的施工速度，在北京市建筑史上是史无前例的。
    我们这次搞快速施工能够取得这样大的成绩，首先是认真地进行了工程排队的工作。在排队中，曾经有过两条对立的方针、两种不同的做法。一种方法是分兵把口，齐头并进，打消耗战，把有限的人力、材料撒了“胡椒面”。其结果必然会造成老工程完不了，新工程上不去，特别是具有政治意义的工程和“元帅”、“先行”工程有被挤掉的危险。另一种方法是集中兵力，缩短战线，重点突击，打歼灭战和速决战，把有限的人力、材料用在最重要、最有效的方面，搞完一个，再搞一个，搞完一批，再搞一批。只有这样，才能够使重点工程迅速上去，从而反过来又为其他工程创造条件。这是一马当先、万马奔腾的方法，完全符合多快好省的建设方针。
    我们安排的具体方法是：第一，以工业建设和重要的政治性建筑为主，兼顾其它方面的紧迫需要。在重点工程中又首先安排其中的主要建筑物。第二，与重点突击相结合，力求缩短战线。对于那些目前已经大部建成的项目，不论重要不重要，不论工程大小，都尽量争取早日建成，投入生产或交付使用，提高成品率。第三，不是以料定产，而是有意识地多安排一些，把各方面的积极因素和潜力打进去，力争多完成一些建筑面积。第四，对于已做基础，正进入结构的一般工程，绝大多数继续施工；少数不太重要而且耗用钢材、水泥过多的工程，一般暂停施工，待钢材、水泥获得供应后再继续施工。第五，与房产管理局结合，对那些被削减、推迟、暂停了项目的单位，尽可能从别的方面设法解决他们用房的困难。
    对于建筑任务的统筹安排，是经过一番思想斗争的。在这里有全局观点与局部观点的斗争；有共产主义大协作精神与本位主义的斗争；也有从照顾情绪和关系出发，平均使用力量与照顾社会主义建设速度，重点突击之间的不同观点的斗争。由于在市委直接领导下，对干部明确地提出了这样几个观点：有所不为，然后才可以有所为；有先行，就得有后进；有重点，就得有轻点；有快，就得有慢。在这些观点明确之后，排除了各项困难，使排队工作得以顺利进行。这样的排队是积极的，与以往单纯的以料定产完全不同。我们在大跃进中，深刻地体会到，它给组织快速施工创造了极为有利的条件，使我们初步摆脱了原来的被动、混乱局面。
    这次快速施工所以能够远远地超过过去历次的生产运动，除去我们采取了必要的技术措施以外，最重要和最基本的原因，是政治挂帅，使快速施工形成了大规模的群众运动。快速施工，必须充分发动群众，依靠群众。最基本的办法就是大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报。无论是制定计划、研究施工技术措施，研究操作方法，以至于与右倾保守思想进行斗争，我们处处都是通过群众、依靠群众来解决的。如开始提出跃进计划要在四十天内完成一百八十多万平方公尺的任务时，有些领导同志信心不足，把握不大。但一经群众讨论，正好相反，他们斗志昂扬，干劲冲天，提出：“把星星变月亮，把月亮变太阳，不完成任务不下战场”。这就改变了某些领导干部的认识。
    由于充分发动群众，大搞快速施工，生产力获得飞跃的发展，在建筑企业内部引起了深刻的变化。在企业的组织管理方面，许多陈旧规章被冲破了，否定了，废除了，新的符合于生产力发展的管理办法成长了。在施工准备上，片面强调“三不开工”（没有合同预算不开工、图纸不全不开工、施工准备不齐不开工）被否定，改为根据客观要求实行边设计、边施工、边备料的“三边”方法。在计划工作上，不再关起门来，单纯由技术人员编；而是先由领导上提出总的规划要求，交给群众讨论、补充，肯定施工技术措施，然后再变成具体的施工计划，贯彻到群众中去。计划的下达与讨论，也是采取群众运动的方式，召开现场比武大会，写大字报，贴保证书，把抽象的计划，变成群众具体行动的决心书。此外，技术管理制度、统计工作、财务预算工作，也都大大简化了。财务工作上普遍实行了以表代账的办法，创造了“快速预算”“快速成本”和“快速结算”等办法。
    在快速施工的情况下，领导必须深入现场，跟班劳动，与群众同甘共苦，了解群众、熟悉生产，向群众学习，然后反过来领导群众，指挥生产。这样，就可以有效地克服三风五气。
    现在，我局以快速施工为纲的群众运动正在进一步向前发展，当前的中心问题是要在已取得初步经验的基础上，使快速施工成为今后建筑企业正常的施工方法。这就需要把快速施工的各项基本措施普遍地推广，使广大职工能够熟练的掌握并继续加以发展。同时，还要尽快的在组织、制度等方面进行系统的改革，使之与快速施工和大规模的群众运动相适应。
