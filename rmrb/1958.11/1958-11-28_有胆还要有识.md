Not Only Courage, But Also Knowledge
Tian Ma

Whenever I talk about daring to think and act, I can't help but think of Zhao Yun in "Romance of the Three Kingdoms." Let's look at the Battle of Hanshui. The veteran general Huang Zhong was besieged by Cao Cao's troops, and Zhao Yun led troops to meet him. Before leaving, he told his general Zhang Yi to tightly guard the camp and set up more crossbows on both sides as preparation. When he rescued Huang Zhong and returned, Cao Cao's troops came after them. Zhang Yi suggested closing the camp gates and defending from the enemy towers. Zhao Yun refused. On one hand, he deployed crossbowmen to ambush in the trenches outside the camp, and on the other hand, he turned all the flags and spears in the camp upside down, silenced the drums, and stood alone with his horse and spear outside the camp gate. Cao Cao's troops chased after him, and when they saw this situation, they were baffled and turned back. Zhao Yun waved his spear, and the crossbows in the trenches fired together. It was getting dark, and they didn't know how many Shu soldiers there were. As a result, Cao Cao's troops trampled on each other and fled in defeat...

No wonder people praised: "Changshan Zhao Zilong, all courage!" But is Zhao Yun only showing "courage" here? He dared to stand alone with his horse and spear outside the camp gate without fear, which is indeed "courage;" but silencing the flags and drums, secretly setting up an ambush, and taking advantage of the favorable conditions of the dark sky, where the enemy could not see the details, to defeat the enemy and turn defeat into victory, this is not only courage, but also "knowledge," and also methods. Only with "courage" and "knowledge," and having methods when things happen, can one be a true hero who is invincible. In the high tide of our socialist Great Leap Forward, the masses put forward the slogan "Youths' vigor surpasses Zhao Yun," and did not choose Xu Chu, who "fought naked against Ma Chao," as their learning and competition opponent, which is not without reason. Like Xu Chu, once he got into a killing mood, he would risk his life and disregard everything, even fighting shirtless. This spirit is commendable, but the method is really not worth imitating.

Many facts since the Great Leap Forward have proved that the masses' understanding of the spirit of daring to think and do is comprehensive. They are not blindly daydreaming, like the myths describe, stepping on a flying cloud scarf to soar into the sky, or wearing wave-breaking shoes to cross the ocean. What they think and do are things that are possible to achieve today through effort, given the conditions. It is not fantasy, but having courage and knowledge, and having various measures as guarantees. The so-called "courage" is daring to think and do, daring to break superstitions, and giving full play to human subjective initiative; the so-called "knowledge" is proceeding from reality, seeking truth from facts, studying and mastering the laws of things themselves, and adopting corresponding measures to create miracles. They also pay attention to studying objective conditions, but they are fundamentally different from "condition theorists." "Condition theorists" see things but not people. When observing things and considering problems, they only see the difficult side, while turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to the favorable conditions. They think that many things that could have been done with effort, although difficult, cannot be done, and they do not put in that effort. There is a Sichuan folk song that says: "Difficulty is like a scale, see if you are tough, if you are tough, it will be soft, if you are soft, it will be tough." "Condition theorists" are very soft in the face of difficulties, so difficulties become hard for them. Therefore, they can only sigh helplessly: "Difficulty, ah, difficulty!" Therefore, everyone else is in the Great Leap Forward, but they can hardly move a step.

For those who dare to think and do, they do not ignore difficulties, but they seriously study them, which difficulties can be overcome with effort, and which difficulties cannot be overcome under current conditions. They do not go beyond the conditions permitted by objective circumstances to force themselves to do absurd things that violate the laws. And once they discover those difficulties that can be overcome, they will not hesitate to eliminate them like Zhao Zilong cutting down five generals. Because they are tough, difficulties soften in front of them. Therefore, they can move forward by riding the wind and waves.

The "condition theorists" may ask, haven't the masses now summarized an experience called "How brave people are, how much the land produces"? Isn't this a bit unrealistic? I think this way of understanding the problem is a bit too simplistic. The "courage" in the saying "How brave people are" includes practical measures. These two sentences mean that the more effort you put in, the more harvest you will get, not that you can produce 10 million catties per mu just by thinking about it. For example, engaging in high-yield experimental fields has corresponding measures as guarantees, such as seed selection, the depth of plowing, the amount of fertilizer, planting density, and the guarantee of water conservancy and ventilation, etc.

In short, daring to think and do is linked to seeking truth from facts and should not be separated. To be Zhao Yun, not Xu Chu, this is exactly what many laborers who have achieved amazing accomplishments have told us.

    有胆还要有识
    天马
    一谈到敢想敢干，我就不免联想起“三国演义”里的赵云来。且看汉水之战那一回。老将黄忠被曹兵围困，赵云领兵前去接应，临走前他叫部将张翼紧守营寨，两壁厢多设弓弩，以为准备。当他救了黄忠回来时，曹兵赶来，张翼建议闭上寨门，上敌楼防护。赵云不从，一面拨弓弩手于寨外壕中埋伏，一面却将营内旗枪尽皆倒偃，金鼓不鸣，自己匹马单枪，立于营门之外。曹兵追来，看见这种情况莫名其妙，翻身便回。赵云把枪一招，壕中弓弩齐发，时值天色昏黑，正不知蜀兵有多少。因而曹兵自相践踏，大败而逃。……
    如此这般，难怪人们大赞：“常山赵子龙，一身皆是胆”了。但是赵云在这里表现的只是“胆”吗？他敢匹马单枪立于营门之外而丝毫不惧，的确是“胆”；但偃旗息鼓，暗设埋伏，利用天色昏黑，敌人看不清底细的有利条件，而大败敌军反败为胜。这就不仅有胆，而且有“识”，而且有办法。有“胆”有“识”，遇事有办法，才能是战无不胜的真英雄。在我们社会主义大跃进的高潮中，群众提出了“青年干劲赛赵云”的口号，而不选“裸衣战马超”的许褚，作为自己心目中学习和比赛的对手，不是没有道理的。像许褚那样，一旦杀得性起的时候，便拼出性命来，什么也不顾了，竟至打仗也赤膊上阵，这种精神固然可嘉，办法却实在不值得效法。
    大跃进以来的许多事实证明，群众对敢想敢做的精神的理解是全面的，他们并非不着边际地胡思乱想，像神话小说里所描写的那样，踏上飞云帕就能腾云上天，穿上破浪鞋就能飘洋过海。他们所想和所做的，是今天有条件，经过努力可能做到的事情。不是空想，而是有胆有识，有种种的措施作保证。所谓“胆”，就是敢想敢做，敢于破除迷信，发挥人的主观能动性；所谓“识”，就是从实际出发，实事求是，研究和掌握事物本身的规律，采用相应的措施去创造奇迹。他们也注意研究客观条件，但和“条件论”者有根本不同的地方。“条件论”者见物不见人，观察事物、考虑问题时，只看见困难的一面，而对有利的条件则视而不见，听而不闻。对许许多多虽有困难但经过努力本来可以做到的事，他们却认为做不到，不去努这一把力。有首四川民歌说：“困难像杆秤，看你硬不硬，你硬它就软，你软它就硬”。“条件论”者在困难面前软得很，所以困难对他们就硬起来了。因而他们就只好无可奈何的唉声叹气：“困难啊，困难啊！”因此人人都在大跃进，他们却寸步难行。
    对于敢想敢做的人来说，他们并不无视困难，但他们却认真地去研究，哪些困难是经过努力可以克服的，哪些困难在目前还没有条件去克服，他们并不超越客观情况所许可的条件，去硬做那些不合规律的荒唐事。而当他们一旦发现那些可以克服的困难，他们就毫不犹豫地像赵子龙力斩五将那样把它消除。因为他们硬，困难就在他们面前软下来了。因而他们就能乘风破浪地前进。
    “条件论”者也许要问了，群众现在不是总结了一条经验叫做“人有多大胆，地有多大产”么？这难道不是有些不着边际？我看这样理解问题，未免头脑太简单了一些。所谓有“多大胆”的“胆”字，包括了实际措施在内，这两句话是说你花了多大的心血，就能获得多大的收成，不是说你想亩产一千万斤就能亩产一千万斤。比如搞丰产试验田，就有相应的措施作保证，如种子的选择，地翻的深浅，肥料的多少，栽植的密度以及水利、通风的保证等等。
    总之，敢想敢做是和实事求是联系在一起的，不应该加以割裂。要作赵云，不要作许褚，这正是许多获得惊人成就的劳动者，所告诉我们的。
