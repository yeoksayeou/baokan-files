    Damascus "Light" Newspaper
    Publishes Chairman Mao's Thesis on Paper Tigers
    Abidin Praises Chairman Mao's Brilliant Judgment
    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 6th. The Damascus "Light" newspaper published on the 5th the first part of the document "Comrade Mao Zedong on Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers," compiled by the editorial department of the Beijing "People's Daily," and published a photograph of Chairman Mao.

    The Grand Mufti of the Syrian Region of the United Arab Republic, Abidin, praised Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment of regarding American imperialism as a paper tiger when he received Xinhua News Agency reporters on the evening of the 4th.

    Abidin and the other five members of the Syrian Muslim delegation had just returned here after concluding a visit to China. He said that any small country, if it is vigilant and awake, imperialism will not dare to touch it. Therefore, imperialism would not dare to touch the People's Republic of China, which has achieved achievements in nine years that the most powerful countries in the world have not achieved.

    Abidin also said that imperialism can only offend those countries that succumb to "mysterious" fate, and cannot gain anything from awakened countries that have already stood up. These countries are trying to build their honor with their own hands.

    Speaking of the Chinese people's friendly feelings towards the Arabs, Abidin said, "We felt that when we were there, we were among our own nation, among our brothers, and in our own country.

    大马士革“光明报”
    刊载毛主席论纸老虎
    阿比丁赞扬毛主席的英明论断
    新华社大马士革6日电　大马士革“光明报”在5日发表了北京“人民日报”刊登该报编辑部辑录的“毛泽东同志论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的文献的第一部分，并且刊登了毛主席的照片。
    阿拉伯联合共和国叙利亚地区的大穆弗蒂·阿比丁在4日晚上接见新华社记者时，赞扬毛主席把美国帝国主义看作是纸老虎这一英明的论断。
    阿比丁同叙利亚穆斯林代表团的另外五个团员刚结束了对中国的访问回到了这里。他说，任何小国，如果它是警惕的和觉醒的话帝国主义就不敢碰它。所以，帝国主义更不敢碰在九年内取得了世界上最强大的国家所没有取得的成就的中华人民共和国。
    阿比丁又说，帝国主义只能触犯那些向“神秘”的命运屈服的国家，而不能从觉醒的、已经站起来的国家中得到任何东西。这些国家设法用它们自己的双手来建立它们的荣誉。
    阿比丁在谈到中国人对阿拉伯人的友好感情时说，“我们感到，当我们在那里的时候，我们是处在我们的民族当中，处在我们的兄弟中间，处在我们自己的国家内。
