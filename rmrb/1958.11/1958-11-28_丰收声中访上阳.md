Visiting Shangyang Amidst the Sounds of Harvest
By Our Correspondent Wang Yuzhang

In early November, I revisited the Shangyang Agricultural Cooperative in Sunan County, South Pyongan Province, Korea, which Premier Zhou Enlai visited this February. Only nine months have passed, but Shangyang Village has changed so much that I almost couldn't recognize it.

Just inside the village entrance is a low earthen platform, where Premier Zhou Enlai spoke to the farmers. Now, many of the old houses that used to be next to the platform are gone, replaced by thirty newly built rural residences with red tiles and white walls, lined up along the newly built road in front of the village. On the hill across the road, a club that can accommodate seven hundred people is under construction. The farmers said they want to build the club to celebrate the New Year.

Even more exciting is the harvest at Shangyang Cooperative. On the hillside next to the new houses, girls are spreading snow-like cotton on the cotton-drying field to be exposed to the sun. On the other side of the hill is the threshing ground, where farmers are busy threshing rice grains on dozens of electric threshing machines. Piles of golden rice are stacked up like small mountains. This year, the average rice yield of the Shangyang Agricultural Cooperative reached 4.5 tons per chongbo (one chongbo is approximately 15 mu), with the highest reaching nine tons; the yield of seed cotton was 3.5 tons per chongbo, with the highest reaching twelve tons. The average rice yield per chongbo increased by one ton compared to last year, and this was achieved in the face of a particularly severe drought this year. Before liberation, the rice yield in this area of Shangyang Village was only about one ton per chongbo.

However, when compared to the Shangyang Cooperative's increased production targets for next year, this year's harvest seems ordinary. Next year, the Shangyang Cooperative aims to achieve a rice yield of 30 tons per chongbo, 24 tons of cotton, 27 tons of corn, and 40 tons of apples per chongbo in the apple orchard. Like every agricultural cooperative in Korea, this cooperative will also run large-scale experimental fields next year. They plan to harvest 300 tons of rice, 120 tons of cotton, and 180 tons of corn per chongbo in the experimental fields.

Although the autumn harvest is not completely over, the members have already thrown themselves into the battle to win an even greater harvest next year. Cooperative Chairman Li Zongchun said that the first task of the agricultural cooperative is to accumulate fertilizer. Walking out of Shangyang Village and looking around, the fields are full of people accumulating fertilizer, with 60% of the cooperative's workforce dedicated to it.

Li Zongchun said that the members are responding to the call of the Workers' Party and will fully realize water conservancy this winter.

The Shangyang Cooperative originally had more than 400 households, but now it has merged with three other small cooperatives into one large cooperative. Cooperative Chairman Li Zongchun said that there are many benefits to merging the cooperatives. First, without the merger, it would be difficult to mobilize 30,000 workers to build water conservancy facilities this winter, and the task of water conservancy would not be completed. Second, in the past, the cooperatives were small and scattered, and some cooperatives planted cotton in low-lying areas that were not suitable for cotton cultivation; now that the cooperative is much larger, it can adjust according to local conditions, and the increase in cotton production is more guaranteed. In addition, with a larger cooperative, the economic strength is greater, and next year the cooperative will buy six cars and seven tractors, and the realization of mechanization will be faster.

The Shangyang Cooperative's dining hall has also been established, and more than 2,000 of the 3,300 people in the cooperative are already eating in the dining hall. Once the dining hall's equipment is further expanded, full communal dining will be realized. Before establishing the dining hall at the end of October this year, all members of the Shangyang Cooperative had three discussions. They warmly welcomed communal dining and calculated a detailed account. Establishing a dining hall can free every able-bodied woman from the stove, allowing them to work three more hours a day, make two fewer trips to the market a month, and collect firewood fewer times. In this way, the cooperative can produce 150,000 more workdays a year, greatly solving the labor shortage problem caused by the expansion of production next year. In addition, the cooperative has also established sewing groups, nurseries, kindergartens, and other public facilities.

Shangyang Village is a beautiful place with green mountains and clear waters. In the spring, the apple blossoms on the hills bloom in patches of white. The shallow water and green grass by the stream make it the best grazing land. It produces grain, cotton, fruits, livestock, silkworm cocoons, and honey. But before liberation, it was a famous poor place. Five landlords occupied almost all the land, and the farmers had to give the landlords 50%-70% of their harvest after a year of cultivation. Cooperative Chairman Li Zongchun told a joke: At that time, farmers were often forced to borrow debts and grain from landlords all year round. Often, after threshing in the autumn and paying rent and debts to the landlords, they were left with only a broom and a dustpan. Farmer Pu Qingzhi even had his broom and dustpan confiscated by the landlord once.

But today, 63-year-old Pu Qingzhi got married in the year he joined the cooperative—at the age of 60—moved into a new house, and even had a son this year. This year, each farmer in the cooperative can receive 3,500 kilograms of grain and 140,000 North Korean won. This year, due to the bumper cotton harvest, the farmers' cash income has reached ten times that of last year. Now the living standards of the members have generally reached the level of middle peasants or above. By next year, each household will raise three pigs and four chickens, and each person can eat 420 eggs and 53 kilograms of pork. Next year, 150 new houses will be built.

Shangyang Village has a deep connection with the Chinese people. In the winter of 1952, American planes bombed Shangyang Village, destroying more than 100 houses. At that time, the Volunteer Army stationed here rescued residents amidst the smoke and flames. In the spring of 1953, the American bandits bombed Jianlong Reservoir near Shangyang Village again, and the flood inundated Shangyang Village and its land. The Volunteer Army and the People's Army braved the bombing and strafing of enemy planes and worked side by side to repair the reservoir dam, enabling the farmers of Shangyang Village to plant their land that year. In February this year, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and others visited Shangyang Village, giving the people of Shangyang Village great encouragement. Now Shangyang Village is changing rapidly. Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the members of the Shangyang Cooperative are marching forward on the socialist road with their heads held high. (Attached picture)

### 丰收声中访上阳

    丰收声中访上阳
    本报记者　王玉章
    11月上旬，记者再一次访问了周恩来总理今年2月曾经访问过的朝鲜平安南道顺安郡上阳农业社。时间前后只隔了九个月，可是上阳村已经变得使我几乎认不出了。
    一进村口有一座不高的土台，周恩来总理就在这里向农民们讲过话。现在土台旁边的原来的许多旧房子都不见了，新建成的三十幢红瓦白墙的农村住宅，沿着村前新修的大路一字儿排开。对面的山岗上一幢可容七百人的俱乐部正在兴建起来。农民们说，要盖起俱乐部来欢庆新年。
    更使人兴奋的是上阳社的丰收。就在新房子旁边的山坡上，姑娘们正把雪团似的棉花摊在晒棉场上曝晒。山坡的另一边是打谷场，农民们正忙着在数十部电动脱谷机上脱稻粒，金黄色稻谷一堆堆地堆得像小山一样。今年上阳农业社水稻产量平均每町步（每町步约合十五市亩）达到四点五吨，最高的九吨；棉花每町步收籽棉三点五吨，最高的十二吨。水稻每町步的平均产量比去年增加了一吨，但这是在今年特大旱灾的情况下取得的。上阳村这一带在解放前每町步的水稻产量只有一吨左右。
    但是，如果同明年上阳社的增产指标相比的话，今年的丰收就显得平常了。明年上阳社要使水稻每町步的产量达到三十吨，棉花二十四吨，玉蜀黍二十七吨，苹果园每町步收苹果四十吨。像朝鲜的每个农业社一样，这个社明年也大办试验田，他们计划在每町步的试验田里收三百吨稻谷、一百二十吨棉花和一百八十吨玉蜀黍。
    现在秋收虽然还没有完全结束，可是社员们早已投入了争取明年更大丰收的战斗。社长李宗淳说，当前农业社的第一项任务是积肥。走出上阳村四处望去，田野里到处是积肥的人群，全社60％的人马都投进去了。
    李宗淳说，社员们响应劳动党的号召，要在今冬就全部实现水利化。
    上阳社原来有四百多户，现在同另外三个小社并成了一个大社。社长李宗淳说，并社好处多得很。首先，如不并社，今冬就很难抽出三万个工修水利，水利化的任务也就完不成。其次，过去社小分散，有的社在不宜种棉的洼地上种棉；现在社大得多了，可以因地制宜地调整，棉花的丰产更有了保证。另外，社大了，经济力量就更大，明年这个社要买六部汽车、七部拖拉机，实现机械化也更快了。
    上阳社的食堂也建立起来了，社内三千三百人已有二千多人在食堂吃饭。等食堂的设备进一步扩大后，就要实现全部食堂化。在今年10月底建立食堂以前，上阳社的全体社员曾进行了三次讨论，他们热烈欢迎食堂化，他们算了一笔细账，建立食堂可以使每个能劳动的妇女离开锅台，每天可多做三小时的工，一个月可少赶二趟集，可以少打几次柴，这样全社一年就可以多出十五万个工，大大地解决了明年由于扩大生产而劳力不足的问题。另外，这个社还建立了缝纫组、托儿所、幼儿园等公共设施。
    上阳村是个美丽的地方，山青水绿，春天山岗上的苹果花开得一片一片白。小溪边水浅草青，是最好的放牧地。这里出产粮、棉、水果、家畜、蚕茧、蜂蜜。可是在解放前这里是个著名的穷地方。五个地主霸占着几乎是全部的土地，农民们耕种一年被地主拿去收获的50％—70％。社长李宗淳讲了一个笑话，那时农民们常年被迫向地主借债、借粮，经常秋天打完了场向地主交租还债以后，只剩下一把扫帚和一个簸箕。农民朴庆植有一次竟连扫帚和簸箕也被地主扣下了。
    可是今天，六十三岁的朴庆植在他入社的那一年——六十岁的时候，结了婚，住上了新住宅，今年还抱了一个儿子。今年全社每户农民可以分得三千五百公斤粮和十四万元朝币，今年由于棉花的丰收，农民的现款收入达到去年的十倍。现在社员们的生活水平已经普遍达到中农以上的水平。到明年每户要养三头猪、四只鸡，每人可吃到四百二十个鸡蛋，五十三公斤猪肉。明年还要建设一百五十幢新住宅。
    上阳村和中国人民有着深厚因缘。1952年冬天，美机轰炸上阳村，炸毁了一百多户房屋，当时驻在这里的志愿军冒着硝烟烈火抢救居民。1953年春，美国强盗又炸毁了上阳村附近的见龙水库，大水淹了上阳村和上阳村的土地。志愿军和人民军冒着敌机的轰炸扫射并肩抢修起水库大坝，使上阳村的农民当年种上了地。今年2月周恩来总理、陈毅副总理等访问上阳村，给了上阳村的人以很大的鼓舞。现在上阳村正在迅速地变化着。在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，上阳社的社员们正昂首阔步地在社会主义大道上前进。（附图片）
