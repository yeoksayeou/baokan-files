Xinhua News Agency, 14th Dispatch: The data on the development of the national economy in October provided by the State Statistical Bureau shows that under the guidance of the policy of "taking steel as the key link" and the whole people running industry, the steel front achieved a great victory in October, and the national economy also leaped forward at a faster speed.

	I. Industrial Production and Capital Construction
	The total industrial output value of the country in October (excluding the output value of handicrafts and industries run by people's communes, same below) reached 11.9 billion yuan, an increase of 12% over the previous month and 119% over the same period last year; the cumulative total output value from January to October was 76.5 billion yuan, an increase of 67% over the same period last year, completing 80% of the annual leap forward plan.
	The total amount of capital construction investment completed in October was 3.1 billion yuan, an increase of 147% over the same period last year; the cumulative investment amount from January to October was 18.4 billion yuan, an increase of 1.3 times over the same period last year, completing 83% of the annual leap forward plan. This month, steel construction was even more rapid, with a newly added iron smelting capacity of 10.97 million tons and a steelmaking capacity of more than 9 million tons. As of the end of October, the country's newly added annual iron smelting capacity reached 32.08 million tons, and the annual steelmaking capacity reached 18.55 million tons.
	In October, the daily output of steel and coal showed a great leap forward with a multiple increase: the daily output of steel increased by 86% compared with September, iron increased by 4.4 times, and coal increased by 1.9 times. This month, the national average daily output of steel was 60,500 tons, the daily output of iron was 280,000 tons, and the daily output of coal was 2.26 million tons. The total steel output for the month reached 1.88 million tons; pig iron was 8.72 million tons; coal was 70.21 million tons.
	The rapid development of steel and raw coal production fully demonstrates the importance of carrying out mass movements on a large scale. The steel output of the 18 key steel enterprises in the country increased by only 15% and 16% in October compared with September, while the steel output of local "small native groups" increased by 5.5 times and 7.8 times compared with September. The proportion of "small native groups" in the national steel output increased from 14% and 58% in September to 49% and 91% in October. In October, coal production in large coal mines increased by 24% compared with September, while coal production in local small coal kilns increased by 4.9 times. In September, the output of large coal mines was 1.7 times that of small coal kilns, and in October, the output of small coal kilns leaped to 2.8 times the output of large coal mines.
	The utilization coefficients of blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and electric furnaces in the 18 key steel enterprises across the country have also been improved. In October, the blast furnace utilization coefficient increased by 2.1% compared with September, the open-hearth furnace utilization coefficient increased by 8.1%, and the electric furnace utilization coefficient increased by 11.4%. The Shanghai Steel Company No. 3 Plant set a new record in October with an open-hearth furnace utilization coefficient of 17.05 tons of steel per square meter, and the Benxi Iron and Steel Company No. 1 Ironmaking Plant set a new record with a blast furnace utilization coefficient of 2.245 tons of iron per cubic meter.
	Although the steel output of the 18 key steel enterprises increased by more than 15% compared with September, most enterprises failed to complete the monthly leap forward plan. Moreover, the steel produced by the "small, native, and mass" methods still has a problem of poor quality, which needs to be further resolved.
	Driven by the steel marshal, the production of other major industrial products also greatly improved in October. Except for rolling mills, steam turbines, and transported timber, which did not complete the leap forward plan, other major products completed and overfulfilled the monthly leap forward plan.

	II. Agricultural Production and the Rural Communitization Movement
	As of the end of October, the national autumn and winter sowing area has reached 423.84 million mu, of which winter wheat sowing is 291.19 million mu, completing 77% of the sowing plan. The wheat-growing areas in the Yellow River Basin and its north have basically been completed, and the areas in the Yangtze River Basin and its south are currently undergoing intense work.
	Rapeseed has been sown on 32.02 million mu, completing 52.9% of the sowing plan.
	With the development of autumn and winter sowing, the deep plowing and manure accumulation movement has entered a climax. By the end of October, the national deep plowing area has reached 579.11 million mu, an increase of 1.8 times compared with September. Among them, according to statistics from 17 provinces, cities, and districts including Shanxi and Liaoning, the area with deep plowing of more than two feet is 60.32 million mu, accounting for 13.2% of the deep plowing area in these regions.
	After the rural areas across the country realized people's communes at the end of September, individual regions with slower commune establishment continued to develop rapidly. As of October 20, there were 26,578 people's communes across the country, with 127 million households participating in the people's communes (including some non-agricultural households).

	III. Transportation
	Driven by the steel marshal, a mass movement of the whole people engaging in transportation has been launched across the country. On the railway transportation trunk lines, an average of 36,000 vehicles were loaded per day for a continuous week; the rate of motor vehicle transportation trains reached an average of one trailer for every two freight vehicles nationwide by the end of this month, and freight vehicles implementing multi-shift systems also accounted for 29% of the total; this month also mobilized 42% of the freight vehicles from state organs and enterprises, and more than 3.2 million rural vehicles and 90,000 rural wooden sailboats participated in social transportation. Therefore, the volume of freight transported by various means of transportation nationwide this month increased by one times compared with the same period last year, of which railway transportation increased by 59%, water transportation increased by 73%, and highway transportation increased by 137%.
	However, due to the surge in freight volume and insufficient transportation capacity, the phenomenon of material backlog is still very serious. This month, the national coal output was 70.21 million tons, but only more than 36 million tons were actually transported, of which the coal storage of 35 major coal mines reached 9 million tons, accounting for half of the output of these mines this month. This month, the output of local iron smelting furnaces in various regions was 7.95 million tons, but only more than 4 million tons were actually transported.

	IV. Commerce
	Since the second half of this year, the social commodity retail sales have been rising month by month. The market was more active in October, with social commodity retail sales of 5.2 billion yuan, an increase of 5.3% compared with September and about 33% compared with the same period last year. Among them, 32 large and medium-sized cities increased by 30.9% compared with the same period last year; 62 key counties increased by 46.4% compared with the same period last year.
	The purchase of agricultural products has begun to accelerate since mid-October.
	The sales volume of consumer industrial products has surged. In particular, the sales volume of seasonal goods has increased even faster. In October, 660 million meters of cotton cloth were sold, an increase of 66.7% compared with the same period last year, and sanitary shirts and trousers increased by nearly one times compared with the same period last year. Due to the participation of the vast number of women in work, the sales of finished products have greatly increased.
	Prices were stable and slightly lower this month. The general retail price index in eight major cities decreased by 0.2% compared with the previous month and the same period last year.

    以钢为纲方针获得辉煌胜利
    今年已新增炼钢能力1855万吨
    十月份钢铁战线空前大捷，促使整个国民经济更快跃进
    秋冬播种面积已达四亿多亩，深翻地和积肥已进入高潮
    新华社14日讯　国家统计局提供的10月份国民经济发展情况的资料表明，在“以钢为纲”全民办工业的方针指导下，10月份钢铁战线获得很大的胜利，国民经济也以更快的速度向前跃进。
        一、工业生产和基本建设
    10月份全国工业总产值（不包括手工业及人民公社办工业产值，下同）达一百一十九亿元，比上月增长12％，比去年同期增长119％；1—10月累计的总产值为七百六十五亿元，比去年同期增长67％，完成全年跃进计划的80％。
    10月份基建投资总额完成三十一亿元，比去年同期增长147％；1—10月累计投资额一百八十四亿元，比去年同期增长一点三倍，完成年跃进计划的83％。本月份钢铁建设更加迅速，新增炼铁能力为一千零九十七万吨，炼钢能力为九百多万吨，截至10月底止，全国新增年炼铁能力达三千二百零八万吨，年炼钢能力达一千八百五十五万吨。
    10月份钢铁和煤的日产量出现了成倍增长的大跃进局面：钢日产量比9月份增长86％，铁增长四点四倍，煤增长一点九倍。这个月全国平均日产钢六点○五万吨，日产铁二十八万吨，日产煤二百二十六万吨。全月的钢产量达一百八十八万吨；生铁八百七十二万吨；煤七千○二十一万吨。
    钢铁和原煤生产的飞跃发展，充分表明了大规模搞群众运动的重要性。全国十八个重点钢铁企业10月份钢铁产量比9月份只增长了15％和16％，地方“小土群”钢铁产量比9月份增长了五点五倍和七点八倍，“小土群”在全国钢铁产量中的比重已由9月份的14％和58％，上升到10月份的49％和91％。10月份大煤矿产煤比9月份增长24％，地方小煤窑产煤则增长了四点九倍，9月份大煤矿产量为小煤窑产量的一点七倍，10月份小煤窑产量已跃升到大煤矿产量的二点八倍。
  　全国十八个重点钢铁企业的高炉、平炉、电炉利用系数也都有提高，10月份高炉利用系数比9月份提高2.1％，平炉利用系数提高8.1％，电炉利用系数提高11.4％。上海钢铁公司三厂10月份平炉利用系数再创每平方公尺产钢一七点○五吨的新纪录，本溪钢铁公司第一炼铁厂再创高炉利用系数每立方公尺产铁二点二四五吨的新纪录。
    虽然，十八个钢铁重点企业钢铁产量比9月份提高15％以上，但大部分企业均未完成月跃进计划。而“小、土、群”所生产的钢铁还有一个质量差的问题，须进一步加以解决。
    在钢铁元帅带动下，10月份其他主要工业产品的生产也有很大提高，除轧钢机、汽轮机和运出木材未完成跃进计划外，其他主要产品都完成和超额完成月跃进计划。
      二、农业生产和农村公社化运动
    截至10月底止，全国秋冬播种面积已达四万二千三百八十四万亩，其中冬小麦播种二万九千一百一十九万亩，完成播种计划的77％。黄河流域及其以北种麦地区已基本完成，长江流域及其以南地区目前正在紧张进行。
    油菜籽已播种三千二百零二万亩，完成播种计划的52.9％。
    随着秋冬播种的开展，深翻地和积肥运动已进入高潮，到10月底全国深翻地面积已达五万七千九百一十一万亩，较9月份增加了一点八倍。其中深翻二尺以上的，据山西、辽宁等十七个省、市、区统计共六千零三十二万亩，占这些地区深翻地面积的13.2％。
    全国农村于9月底实现人民公社化以后，个别建立公社较慢的地区继续迅速发展。至10月20日，全国共有人民公社二万六千五百七十八个，参加人民公社的户数达一万二千七百万户（包括一部分非农业户）。
    三、交通运输
    在钢铁元帅的带动下，全国各地掀起了全民搞运输的群众运动的高潮。在铁路运输干线上，连续一周平均每天装车三点六万辆；汽车运输列车化到本月底全国平均每二辆货运汽车有一辆挂车，实行多班制的货运汽车也占总数的29％；本月并调动了42％的国家机关、企业单位的货运汽车，三百二十多万辆农村车辆和九万艘农村木帆船参加社会运输。因此，这个月全国各种运输工具货运量比去年同期增长一倍，其中铁路运输增长59％，水运增长73％，公路运输增长137％。
    但是，由于运量激增，运输能力不足，物资积压现象仍很严重。本月份全国煤产量为七千零二十一万吨，实际运出的只有三千六百多万吨，其中三十五个主要煤矿存煤量达九百万吨，占这些矿本月产量的一半。本月份各地炼铁土炉生产量为七百九十五万吨，但实际运出只有四百多万吨。
    四、商业
    今年下半年以来，社会商品零售额逐月上升，10月份市场更加活跃，社会商品零售额为五十二亿元，比9月份上升5.3％，比去年同期上升33％左右。其中三十二个大中城市比去年同期上升30.9％；六十二个重点县比去年同期上升46.4％。
    农产品收购工作，从10月中旬以来，已开始加快。
    消费性的工业品销售量激增。特别是换季商品的销售量增长更快。10月份棉布销售六点六亿公尺，比去年同期增加66.7％，卫生衫裤比去年同期增长近一倍。由于广大妇女参加工作之后，制成品的商品销售大大增加。
    本月物价平稳并稍有下落，八大城市零售物价总指数比上月和比去年同期均下降0.2％。
