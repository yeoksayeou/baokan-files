Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 1st. Since the beginning of this year, the Anshan Iron and Steel Seamless Steel Tube Factory has adopted the mass movement method to carry out large-scale technical innovations on modern equipment, and has tapped amazing production potential. According to the current daily production level, the output of seamless steel tubes this year can increase to 2.4 times the designed capacity; next year it will increase to 5 times the designed capacity. On October 11th, the entire factory had already completed this year's national planned output eighty-one days ahead of schedule, and by the end of the year, it can increase steel tube production by 50,000 tons compared to the national plan.

The Anshan Iron and Steel Seamless Steel Tube Factory was put into production in October 1953, a factory with highly mechanized and automated equipment. In the past few years, due to some people, especially some technical cadres, holding a mysterious view of the factory's design, equipment, and technical regulations, they did not dare to boldly implement technical innovations, so production did not develop quickly. Since the beginning of this year, in order to meet the urgent needs of national construction, the factory has successively organized four great leaps in production. They adopted the methods of great airing of views, great blooming, great debate, and big-character posters to mobilize the masses to severely criticize various right-leaning conservative thoughts and dogmatism, and initially broke the superstition of the original design standards and modern equipment, and boldly implemented innovations. So far, more than half of the technical regulations and design standards of the entire factory have been revised, and almost all equipment has undergone major or minor innovations. There are more than 30 major innovation projects carried out on the main steel rolling equipment, such as piercing machines, rolling mills, and straightening machines, which have greatly increased the efficiency of the machines compared to the original design. The original design stipulated that the equipment maintenance cycle for the entire factory was one inspection per week, for 24 hours each time. Now, according to the workers' conscious maintenance of equipment and skilled operation, it has been changed to one inspection every two weeks, for 12 hours each time, and in reality, it only takes 8 hours each time. This item alone has increased the output by about 7% compared to the original design. The original design, in order to ensure product quality, required that only steel tubes below 76 mm could be produced by reducing the diameter of large tube billets. Now, according to the improvement of workers' technical level, steel tubes with diameters of 76 to 127 mm also adopt the method of reducing the diameter of large tube billets. This has increased the output by more than 40% compared to the past. While innovating equipment, design standards, and technical regulations, the factory's employees also made four sets of small steel rolling equipment themselves, which played a great role in increasing steel tube production.

The achievements obtained by mass technical innovation have given a vivid lesson to those who originally opposed innovation. It not only proves that new factories with complex technology and advanced design have infinite potential, and also need and can implement innovation; but also fully demonstrates that design, equipment, and regulations are all dead, and only people are the most active and dynamic factors in production. In the past, some conservatives believed that launching a mass technical innovation campaign in a modern factory with advanced design and complex technology like the seamless steel tube factory would not only fail to produce any "results," but also cause "trouble" and accidents. After several debates, especially after the practice of innovation, they began to realize that with the development of science and technology and the improvement of workers' technical level in recent years, many of the original designs and technical regulations could no longer adapt to the new situation, and launching a mass innovation campaign would not cause any "trouble." For example, the original design of the straightening machine's roll inclination angle was 6.5 degrees, and some workers suggested changing it to 7.5 degrees, which could speed up the rolling speed. However, some technicians believed that changing it would reduce the quality. This issue was debated among the leaders for a long time, and it was not resolved. Finally, the Party organization mobilized the workers to debate with the technicians and organized the workers to conduct experiments, proving that changing it to 7.5 degrees did not reduce the quality. Now the inclination angle of the straightening machine's rolls has been changed to 8 degrees, and the efficiency of rolling each steel tube has increased by more than 10%.

Judging from the current situation, this factory still has great production potential. The entire factory is continuing to carry out great airing of views, great blooming, great debate, and is preparing to further innovate equipment and technical regulations in this debate.

    现代化工厂怎样充分挖掘生产潜力？
    无缝钢管厂发动群众大搞技术革新
    不迷信设备  要信赖群众
    新华社鞍山1日电　鞍钢无缝钢管厂今年以来采用群众运动的方法在现代化设备上大搞技术革新，已经挖掘出惊人的生产潜力。按照现在达到的日产水平，今年无缝钢管的产量可增长为设计能力的二点四倍；明年将增长为设计能力的五倍。10月11日，全厂已经提前八十一天完成了今年国家计划产量，到年底可以比国家计划增产钢管五万吨。
    鞍钢无缝钢管厂是在1953年10月投入生产的，拥有高度机械化自动化设备的工厂。几年来由于一部分人，特别是一部分技术干部，对这个厂的设计、设备、技术规程抱着神秘观点，不敢大胆地实行技术革新，因此生产发展并不很快。今年以来，这个厂为了满足国家建设的急需，曾先后组织了四次生产大跃进。他们采用大鸣大放大辩论大字报的办法，发动群众狠狠地批判了形形色色的右倾保守思想和教条主义，初步破除了对原有设计标准、现代化设备的迷信，大胆地实行革新。到目前为止，全厂已经修改的技术规程和设计标准，已占原有的一半以上，差不多所有的设备都进行了或大或小的革新。单是在轧管的主要设备穿孔机、轧管机和均整机等方面进行的重要革新项目就有三十多项，从而使机器的效率比原设计大大提高。原设计规定全厂设备小修周期为每星期检修一次，一次二十四小时，现在根据工人自觉地维护设备和操作熟练的情况，改为每两个星期检修一次，一次十二小时，而实际一次只用八小时。这一项就使产量比原设计提高7％左右。原设计为了保证产品质量，要求七十六公厘以下的钢管才能实行大管坯减径生产，现在根据工人技术水平的提高，直径七十六到一百二十七公厘的钢管也采取大管坯减径生产的方法。这样就使产量比过去提高40％以上。全厂职工在革新设备、设计标准和技术规程的同时，还自己动手制成了四套小型轧管设备，对增加钢管产量起了很大作用。
    群众性的技术革新所获得的成果，给原来反对革新的人上了生动的一课。它不但证明了技术复杂、设计先进的新厂有着无穷尽的潜力，同样需要并且可能实行革新；而且也充分说明了设计、设备、规程都是死的，只有人才是生产中最积极最活动的因素。过去有些保守派认为，无缝钢管厂这样设计先进、技术复杂的现代化工厂，发动群众大搞技术革新，不但搞不出“名堂”，还会搞出“乱子”，造成事故。经过几次辩论，特别是经过革新的实践，他们开始认识到：几年来随着科学技术的发展，工人技术水平的提高，原来的设计、技术规程有许多已不能适应新情况，发动群众大搞革新，并不会出什么“乱子”。例如均整机轧辊倾斜角原设计为六点五度，有的工人提议改为七点五度，这样可以加快轧制速度。但是有的技术人员却认为改变后要降低质量。这个问题在领导干部中间争论了许久，也没有解决。最后党组织发动工人同技术人员一起辩论，并且组织工人进行试验，证明改为七点五度并没有降低质量。现在均整机轧辊的倾斜角度已改为八度，轧制每根钢管的效率提高了10％以上。
    就目前情况看，这个厂还有着很大的生产潜力。全厂正在继续开展大鸣大放大辩论，准备在这次辩论中，进一步革新设备和技术规程。
