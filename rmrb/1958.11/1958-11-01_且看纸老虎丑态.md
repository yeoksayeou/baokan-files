Look at the Ugly State of the Paper Tiger
Volunteer Army Combat Hero Lu Changrong

Just as our Volunteer Army delegation was reporting to the central leaders and our dear people in the capital about the completion of the tasks assigned to us by the people of our motherland, we read with excitement and warmth the important document of our beloved leader Chairman Mao on the imperialists and all reactionaries being paper tigers. This profound thesis armed our minds, educated and encouraged us to defeat the enemy—American imperialism; in our struggle to defeat American imperialism, we personally experienced the correctness of Chairman Mao's thesis.

Everyone who has fought against the American imperialists in Korea knows that American imperialism is a veritable paper tiger. Yes, they have so many weapons such as airplanes, artillery, tanks, etc., and they are superior in number, but they were defeated by our inferior forces, and even their commander Clark admitted defeat. That's not all, the invading troops also put on many farces for us to watch while being defeated! For example, our comrades could capture four prisoners with a single stone; American soldiers surrendered by kneeling on the ground, raising their hands trembling; their machine gun firing could be done by tying a rope to the bolt, ... If you are interested, you can see them perform all kinds of ugly poses.

I still remember some scenes from July 6, 1953, when we attacked a secondary peak of Stone Hyun-dong North Mountain. The enemy defending the secondary peak was the U.S. 7th Division. That night it was so dark that we couldn't see anything, and it was raining, and the road was slippery and muddy. Our soldiers were carrying heavy things, and the attack was certainly difficult. But under the cover of our artillery fire, everyone rushed forward like tigers pouncing on food. In just over ten minutes, we captured the enemy's position. After attacking, I searched in a hidden bunker. I saw an American devil’s “corpse.” The second time I went, there were two. I knew they would play dead, so I found one to test his pulse. Just as I was testing, the other guy took out a grenade. I discovered it and shouted. The two guys obediently raised their hands. After we occupied the position, the enemy was not reconciled and launched continuous counterattacks, trying to take the position back. When these guys counterattacked, they didn't dare to walk fast, they all walked slowly, looking left and right, afraid of being shot first if they ran in front. But someone was supervising from behind, so they had to move forward. When they approached us, we gave them a fierce beating. These guys rolled, crawled, and desperately ran downwards. In this way, the enemy launched eleven consecutive counterattacks, suffering more than 400 casualties. Our position, however, remained unshaken.

    且看纸老虎丑态
    志愿军战斗英雄　陆昌荣
    正当我们志愿军代表团，向中央首长和首都亲人们，汇报我们祖国人民交给我们的任务完成情况的时候，我们怀着兴奋而亲切的心情读了我们敬爱的领袖毛主席论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的重要文献。这个深刻的论断，曾经武装了我们的头脑，教育和鼓舞了我们战胜敌人——美帝国主义；在我们打败美帝国主义的斗争中，亲身体会到毛主席这个论断的正确。
    每一个在朝鲜同美帝国主义者交过手的人，都会知道，美帝国主义是一个道道地地的纸老虎。是的，他们有空军、大炮、坦克等等那么多的武器，而且在数量上也占优势，可是恰恰就是被我们这个劣势打败了，连他们的总司令克拉克都认输了。这还不算，侵略军们在吃败仗中，还表演了许多丑剧给我们看哩！比如我们的同志，可以用一块石头捉四个俘虏；美国兵缴枪是跪在地上，双手颤抖地举起；他们机枪的射击，可以用绳子拴在枪栓上射击，……你如果有兴趣的话，可以看到他们表演的各式各样的丑态。
    我还记得在1953年7月6日，我们攻打石岘洞北山次峰的一些情景。守次峰的敌人是美军第七师。那天晚上天黑得看不到东西，下着雨，路上又滑又泥泞。我们战士们带的东西很重，攻击当然很困难。可是在我们炮火掩护下，个个争先，像猛虎扑食。仅仅十多分钟就攻下了敌人的阵地。攻上去后，我到一个暗堡里搜索。看到一个美国鬼子
  “尸首”，第二次去的时候，变成了两个啦。我知道他们会耍死狗，便找一个试试脉搏，正在我试的时候，另一个家伙就掏榴弹，被我发觉，我大喊一声，这两个家伙就乖乖地举起了手。我们占领阵地后，敌人不甘心，就连续向我反扑，想把阵地夺回去。这些家伙反扑时，不敢走快，都是一个个地慢慢走，左顾右盼，恐怕跑在前面先被打死。但是后面有人督战，又不能不走。当走近我们时，我们就一阵狠打，这些家伙就连滚带爬、拉着拖着拼命向下跑。就这样，敌人连续反扑了十一次。伤亡四百多人。我们的阵地，却一直是屹然未动。
