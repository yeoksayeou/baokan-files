To manage early and well, and resolutely prevent three types of seedlings from overwintering is the key to ensuring a bigger wheat harvest next year. Guided by this thought, many areas in the Yellow River, Huai River, and Yangtze River basins immediately grasped field management after sowing wheat; some places that were slow to act are criticizing the idea that “this year’s wheat is rich from the womb, and a bumper harvest can be guaranteed without management,” and are actively launching a field management campaign.

According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture on the 12th, as of the beginning of this month, more than 320 million mu of winter wheat had been sown across the country. The provinces in the Yellow River basin, the main wheat-producing area, have basically finished sowing; the provinces in the Yangtze River basin have also sown more than half; and the southern regions are actively rushing to sow. In order to ensure full seedlings, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi and other provinces generally conducted seedling inspection and replanting while inspecting wheat fields or organizing large-scale inspections and comparisons after the wheat sowing was basically completed. Anhui Province carried out "processing and remedial lessons" for wheat fields that did not meet the requirements for dense planting and more fertilizer.

With the end of sowing, seedling inspection and replanting, many areas in the Yellow River, Huai River, and Yangtze River basins immediately launched a winter field management campaign centered on winter irrigation, topdressing fertilizer, and the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests. The slogan everywhere is "The general will not dismount, the soldiers will not be disarmed, advance victoriously, grasp management greatly, and resolutely prevent the three types of seedlings from overwintering." In order to achieve this goal, many people's communes have organized professional teams to manage wheat fields. In Tianjin Prefecture, Hebei Province, more than 480,000 commune members participated in wheat field management teams, and they are watering and topdressing fertilizer for wheat fields. Many people's communes in Shaanxi Province classify and rank wheat fields, designate special personnel for management, and set a time limit to eliminate the three types of seedlings. In Changge County, Henan Province, more than 2,000 wheat field management professional teams composed of 100,000 commune members are watering and topdressing fertilizer, striving to turn all wheat fields into first-class seedlings by the end of November. Wheat field management professional teams in Yangzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province and Dangshan and Huaiyuan Counties in Anhui Province have also gone to the fields.

Managing large areas of high-yield "satellite" fields is the focus of wheat field management in various places. In order to ensure that large areas of high-yield "satellites" are launched, many people's communes have established special management committees for high-yield fields, formulated management measures, and handed them over to professional teams for implementation. High-yield fields in Yanshi, Changge, and Hua Counties, Henan Province, have achieved indicators for every mu, measures for every plot, and management personnel for every area. In addition to having indicators, measures, and professional teams in every area of high-yield fields in Cheng'an, Wuqing, and Changli Counties in Hebei Province, there is also a responsible cadre to specifically lead the management work. The 28,000 professional teams in Fuyang Prefecture, Anhui Province, that manage large areas of high-yield fields have also signed contracts with the communes, formulated technical operating procedures, and managed them from beginning to end until the harvest next year.

According to what is understood by various localities: the development of the winter wheat field management campaign is still uneven, and some places have not yet taken action. One of the important reasons for the slow action in these places is that some cadres and peasants believe that this year the wheat fields are deeply plowed, heavily fertilized, have good soil moisture, and are densely planted, and the wheat seedlings are "rich from the womb" and can be harvested without processing and management, so they have relaxed wheat field management. This situation has attracted the attention of the leading organs in various places, and some counties are launching cadres and commune members to carry out great debates to criticize this slack mood. Anguo County, Hebei Province, calculated an account in the airing of views and debates: if the wheat fields are processed and managed as early as possible, and the effective tillers are increased by 100,000 plants per mu, the wheat output can be increased by 400 jin. This account moved the hearts of the commune members, and some communes that were slow to act organized professional teams and launched a field management campaign.

### 抓住明年小麦更大丰收的关键  坚决不让三类苗过冬  黄河、淮河和长江流域产麦区展开冬季麦田管理运动

    抓住明年小麦更大丰收的关键
    坚决不让三类苗过冬
    黄河、淮河和长江流域产麦区展开冬季麦田管理运动
    本报讯　早管、管好，坚决不让三类苗过冬是保证明年小麦获得更大丰收的关键。在这一思想指导下，黄河、淮河和长江流域很多地区在种完小麦以后立即抓紧了田间管理；部分行动迟缓的地方，正在批判“今年麦子胎里富，不管也能保丰收”的思想，积极开展田间管理运动。
    据农业部12日统计，到本月上旬全国各地已经播种冬小麦三亿二千多万亩。主要产麦区黄河流域各省已经基本种完；长江流域各省也种了一半以上；南方各地正在积极抢种。为了保证全苗，河南、河北、山东、山西、陕西等省在麦播基本结束以后，一般都在验收麦田或组织大规模检查评比的同时，发动公社社员进行了查苗补种。安徽省对没有达到密植、多肥要求的麦田，进行了“加工补课”。
    随着播种和查苗补苗的结束，黄河、淮河和长江流域各省很多地区立即掀起了以冬灌、追肥和防治病虫害为中心的冬季田间管理运动。各地的口号是“将不下马，兵不解甲，乘胜前进，大抓管理，坚决不让三类苗过冬”。为了达到这个目标，很多地区的人民公社都组织了专业队专管麦田。河北省天津专区参加麦田管理专业队的社员有四十八万多人，正给麦田浇水和追肥。陕西省很多人民公社对麦田分类排队，指定专人管理，限期消灭三类苗。河南省长葛县由十万名社员组成的两千多个麦田管理专业队，正在浇水追肥，力争全部麦田到11月底都成一类苗。江苏省扬州专区和安徽省砀山、怀远等县的麦田管理专业队也已上田。
    管好大面积高额丰产“卫星”田是各地麦田管理的重点。为了保证大面积高产“卫星”上天，很多人民公社建立了高额丰产田的专门管理委员会，制定了管理措施，交给专业队执行。河南省偃师、长葛、滑县等县的高额丰产田都做到了亩亩有指标，块块有措施，片片有人管。河北省成安、武清、昌黎等六县的高额丰产田，除方方都有指标、措施和专业队外，还都有一个负责干部专门领导管理工作。安徽省阜阳专区管理大面积高额丰产田的二万八千多个专业队，还和公社签订了合同，订出技术操作规程，一管到底，直到明年丰收为止。
    据各地了解：小麦冬季田间管理运动开展得尚不平衡，有些地方还没行动起来。这些地方行动迟缓的重要原因之一，是有些干部和农民认为今年麦地翻的深、施肥多、墒情好、种的密，麦苗都是“胎里富”，不用加工管理也能丰收，因此，放松了麦田管理。对于这种情况，已经引起各地领导机关的重视，有些县正在发动干部、社员大鸣大放大辩论，批判这种松劲情绪。河北省安国县在鸣放辩论中算了一个账：如果及早对麦田进行加工管理，以每亩增加有效分蘖十万株计，就可增产麦子四百斤。这笔账打动了社员们的心，一些行动迟缓的社都纷纷组织专业队，开展了田间管理运动。
