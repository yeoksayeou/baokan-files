Sichuan Builds 1600 New Copper Smelting Furnaces

    (By our reporter) After Sichuan vigorously implemented the policy of "small, indigenous, and mass" in the copper smelting industry, a new situation of "copper furnaces forming forests, copper flowing like rivers" has emerged. By mid-October, more than 1,600 new copper furnaces had been built, and the output of crude copper had increased threefold compared to last year.
    According to the new situation, the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committees at all levels grasped industry with one hand and agriculture with the other, mobilizing the masses to launch an indigenous copper smelting campaign. They quickly found more than 1,000 copper mines throughout the province and organized more than 80,000 people to go to the mountains to smelt copper. In order to promote the mass copper smelting movement, the local Party committees have further strengthened their leadership in recent months, assigning secretaries or ministers to take charge of copper smelting, and transferring a large number of capable cadres to copper mines and copper plants to assist in the work. Combining this with strengthening ideological education and carrying out airing views and debates, they promptly solved many new problems encountered in implementing the policy of "small, indigenous, and mass". The copper ore in Huili County was of low grade, and the smelting technology was not easy to master, often resulting in copper-iron alloys. The County Party Secretary personally led people to the mountains to summarize advanced experiences, and promptly promoted the method of first selecting the ore, then smelting the low-grade ore into copper matte, and then refining the copper matte into crude copper, thus dividing the copper smelting into several steps. This enhanced the confidence of the masses, and in a short period of time, more than 100 copper furnaces were built.

    四川新建炼铜炉1600座
    本报讯　四川各地在炼铜工业中大力贯彻小、土、群的方针以后，出现了“铜炉成林，铜水成川”的新局面。到10月中旬，新建的铜炉达到一千六百多座，粗铜的产量比去年增加三百倍。
    中共四川省各级党委根据新形势，一手抓工业、一手抓农业，发动群众掀起了土法的炼铜运动，迅速在全省找到一千多处铜矿，并组织了八万多人上山炼铜。各地党委为了推进群众性的炼铜运动，在最近几个月又进一步加强领导，纷纷确定了书记或部长分管炼铜，抽调大批得力干部到铜矿和铜厂协助工作，结合加强思想教育、开展鸣放辩论，及时解决贯彻小、土、群方针遇到的许多新问题。会理县铜矿的品位低，冶炼技术不易掌握，常常炼成铜铁合金。县委书记便亲自带人上山总结先进经验，及时推广了先选择矿石，再把低品位矿石炼成冰铜，然后由冰铜炼制粗铜的办法，使炼铜分成几步走，这样群众的信心增强了，在短期内，又建成一百多座铜炉。
