Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 22nd. East German Deputy Foreign Minister Wenzel said today that because Western countries have openly violated the Potsdam Agreement and the detailed provisions in the agreement, other signatory countries not only have every reason but also have the right to be free from outdated regulations.

Wenzel made these remarks when answering questions raised by the editorial department of "Neues Deutschland." He refuted the absurd arguments in the West German government's statement on the Berlin status issue. The West German government's statement insisted that the Soviet Union "unilaterally abandoned international agreements" and that Berlin's status was not based on the Potsdam Agreement, but on "international treaties concluded earlier." Wenzel said that this is a trick by Bonn and Washington to deceive the people by using international law.

He said that the Soviet Union has strictly abided by and fully implemented the Potsdam Agreement. On the contrary, it is the Western countries that have unilaterally abandoned their international obligations and the principles of demilitarization and denazification in the Potsdam Agreement, and undermined the principle that Germany will become a unified, peace-loving country with Berlin as its capital. They even used the occupation regulations imposed on West Berlin to create and cover up crimes that violate the principled provisions of the Potsdam Agreement.

Wenzel pointed out that the "international treaties concluded earlier" mentioned by the Bonn government should be a protocol and an oral agreement of the 1944 "European Advisory Commission." However, the "European Advisory Commission" has been dissolved due to the Potsdam Conference. He said that issues such as the division of occupation zones, the exercise of Germany's supreme power, and the management of Greater Berlin only obtained basic processing principles due to the Potsdam Agreement. Therefore, the principled provisions of the Potsdam Agreement are of decisive significance.

### 民主德国副外长文策尔指出  柏林地位以波茨坦协定为根据  西德政府的声明是骗人的鬼把戏

    民主德国副外长文策尔指出
    柏林地位以波茨坦协定为根据
    西德政府的声明是骗人的鬼把戏
    新华社柏林22日电　德意志民主共和国外交部副部长文策尔今天说，由于西方国家公开地破坏了波茨坦协定和协定中的细节规定，因此，其他的缔约国就不仅有一切理由、而且也有权不受陈旧的规定的约束。
    文策尔是在回答“新德意志报”编辑部所提出的问题时说这番话的。他驳斥了西德政府关于柏林地位问题声明中的荒谬论点。西德政府的这篇声明硬说苏联“片面地抛弃国际协议”，柏林的地位不是根据波茨坦协定，而是根据“更早时期缔结的国际条约”。文策尔说，这是波恩和华盛顿企图利用国际公法来欺骗人民的鬼把戏。
    他说，苏联严格地遵守和完全执行了波茨坦协定，而相反地，正是西方国家片面地抛弃了它们的国际义务和波茨坦协定中有关非军事化和非纳粹化的原则，破坏了德国将成为一个统一的、爱好和平的、以柏林为首都的国家的原则。它们甚至利用强加在西柏林头上的占领法规来制造和掩护违反波茨坦协定的原则条款的罪行。
    文策尔指出，波恩政府所说的“更早时期缔结的国际条约”，应当是1944年“欧洲协商委员会”的一项议定书和一项口头约定。但是“欧洲协商委员会”已经由于波茨坦会议而解散了。他说，关于划分占领区、行使德国最高权力和管理大柏林等项问题，只是由于波茨坦协定才获得了基本处理原则。因此，具有决定性意义的是波茨坦协定的原则条款。
