Can the Past Be Forgotten?
    Lin Sheng
    Recently, following some collusion between the British and West German governments, "The Times" published news of West German Defense Minister Strauss and the Chiefs of Staff of the West German Army, Navy, and Air Force, Hausinger, singing in unison. The former openly clamored for the establishment of a Prussian-style officer academy, which should combine the "old selfless spirit of service, honor, and courage with modern technology," and that German soldiers should not be ashamed of past traditions; the latter praised "Hitler's army achieved great success, most of which was due to good leadership." "The Times" then reported that the talks by these two militarists, "good subordinates who loyally served Hitler," were to enhance the prestige of West German officers in the army, because supposedly "some young soldiers refuse to serve in the new army when they hear that Hitler was a war criminal," and the young generation of Germans "are ashamed of the actions of their elders."
    It seems "The Times" has done a very diligent and rather strenuous public relations job for West German militarists. This approach by "The Times" obviously fits well with the hymn recently sung by Macmillan, who loudly proclaimed that the UK and West Germany should "forget the deep and tragic conflicts of the past and jointly envision the future." The Prime Minister wants to "forget the past," while the West German militarists in power are trying to relive the old dream of the "past." This seems contradictory, but in fact, it has something in common, because what Macmillan hopes to "forget" is not the revival of German militarism pursued by the likes of Strauss.
    However, mentioning the "Prussian" "spirit" and "tradition," not to mention the "successes" of "Hitler's soldiers," will not make it easy for the British to "forget" the deep and tragic conflicts between Britain and Germany in the past.
    Prussia was the predecessor of the German Empire (which was unified by Prussia and some small states of the German Confederation). It was a country that grew up in constant wars of plunder. In the 18th century, it was said that war was Prussia's national profession. Because the German Empire was unified relatively late, the world's colonies had already been divided up by imperialist countries such as Britain and France. In order to seize colonies from others, the German Empire particularly emphasized a policy of military plunder. The Prussian militarist tradition finally launched World War I. This war caused significant losses to the people of the world, including 875,000 British deaths and over 2 million injuries. After World War I, British rulers, in order to encourage Germany to attack the Soviet Union, also deliberately "forgot the past and envisioned the future." At the same time as the Munich Agreement was signed, then British Prime Minister Chamberlain loudly proclaimed that the Munich Agreement and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement "symbolize that our two peoples no longer intend to fight each other." Subsequently, some in Britain began to sing the praises of a "powerful Germany and Britain that could 'coexist and prosper.'"
    However, Hitler at the time promoted the "past" Prussian tradition, combining the Prussian spirit with then-modern airplanes, tanks, and mechanized units into "blitzkrieg," launching World War II, and first launching an offensive against Britain and France. When Hitler attacked the British Isles, he concentrated 4,000 aircraft, often dispatching 800 aircraft a day to indiscriminately bomb cities such as London, Coventry, and Portsmouth. This time, "Hitler's soldiers" brought unprecedented disaster to the people of the world, and Britain again sacrificed approximately 700,000 lives in this disaster, with countless injuries and property losses.
    This is a painful historical lesson. For the British people, who have suffered deeply from German militarism in the past and are today facing the threat of its revival, these painful historical lessons must be firmly remembered. If Macmillan is once again trying to play the trick that Chamberlain played in lifting the stone that was Hitler to strike the feet of the Soviet people, then hasn't he thought about the possibility that this stone will also strike the feet of the British rulers themselves, just as it did in the past? The revanchist clamoring of the West German Defense Minister and the Chiefs of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as published in "The Times," is precisely revealing a hint of this.

    能够忘记过去吗？
    林生
    最近期间，在英国和西德政府进行了一些勾搭之后，“泰晤士报”刊载了西德国防部长施特劳斯和西德陆、海、空三军参谋长豪辛格一唱一和消息，前者公开叫嚷要建立一个普鲁士式的军官学院，这个军官学院应该把过去“老的无私的服务精神、荣誉和勇敢跟现代化的技术结合起来”，他要德国士兵不必为过去的传统感到羞耻；后者则颂扬“希特勒的军队取得了极大的成功，这种成功极大部分得归功于好的领导。”“泰晤士报”的消息接着说，这两个军国主义分子、“忠诚为希特勒服务的好部下”的谈话，是为了增强西德军官在军队中的威信。因为据说“一些年青的兵士听到说希特勒是一个战犯时就拒绝在新军中服役”，同时德国的年青一代“为他们的老一辈的行为感到羞耻”。
    看来，“泰晤士报”替西德军国主义者做了一次很殷勤而又颇为吃力的义务宣传。“泰晤士报”这种做法，显然很合乎麦克米伦不久前高唱要同西德“忘掉过去那些深重和惨烈的冲突，共同展视未来”的赞歌的口胃。首相要“忘掉过去”，而当权的西德军国主义者却力图重温“过去”的旧梦。这看来不无矛盾，实则有共同之处，这是因为麦克米伦希望“忘记”的、并不是斯特劳斯之流追求的德国军国主义的复活。
    不过，提到“普鲁士式”的“精神”和“传统”，更不必说是“希特勒的军人”的“成功”，都不能使英国人容易“忘记”英国和德国过去那些深重和惨烈的冲突”。
    普鲁士是德意志帝国的前身（德意志帝国是由普鲁士及一些德意志同盟的小邦国统一而成的）。它是一个在不断的掠夺战争中成长起来的国家。在十八世纪时就有人说过，战争是普鲁士的国家职业。由于德意志帝国统一得比较晚，当时世界的殖民地给英、法等帝国主义国家分割完了。为了从别人手里争夺殖民地，德意志帝国就特别着重于武力掠夺的政策。普鲁士军国主义传统终于发动了第一次世界大战。这场战争使世界人民受到了重大的损失，其中英国人死亡了八十七万五千人，负伤二百万人以上。第一次大战之后，英国的统治者为了要促使德国向苏联进攻，也曾故意地“忘掉过去，展视未来”。当时英国首相张伯伦在慕尼黑协定签订的同时，曾经高声叫嚷什么慕尼黑协定以及英、德海军协定，是“象征着我们两国人民从今彼此不再有作战的意思”。随着英国也有人唱起所谓“强大的德国和英国大可‘并存共荣’”的颂歌来。
    但是，当时的希特勒发扬“过去”的普鲁士传统，把普鲁士精神跟当时的飞机、坦克、机械化部队结合成了“闪电战”，发动了第二次世界大战，并且首先向英、法发动了进攻。当希特勒进攻英伦三岛时，曾经集中了四千架飞机，时常每天出动了八百架飞机向伦敦、考文垂、朴茨茅斯等城市滥施轰炸。这回“希特勒的军人”给世界人民带来了前所未有的灾难，而英国在这次灾难中又牺牲了约七十万人，受伤的人和财产损失更不计其数。
    这就是惨痛的历史教训。对于过去深受德国军国主义灾害的，并且今天又面临德国军国主义复活威胁的英国人民来说，这些惨痛的历史教训怎可不牢牢记住。如果说麦克米伦又想玩弄当年张伯伦搬起希特勒这块石头，去打苏联人民的脚的手法的话，那末，有没有想一下这块石头也会像过去一样打到英国统治者自己的脚上的可能性呢？“泰晤士报”所刊载的西德国防部长和陆、海、空三军参谋长的复仇主义叫嚣，在这方面不正是露了端倪么。
