Qingyang County is an old liberated area, half mountainous and half plain, in Longdong, Gansu Province. In May, the county party committee called on all people in the county to write if they could write, sing if they could sing, paint if they could paint, and sculpt if they could sculpt, to vigorously carry out mass cultural activities. To decorate the countryside richly and beautify the countryside, a mass movement of sculpture and carving was launched. By October, a total of 4,290 pieces had been completed.

The sculpture at the bus station is "The People's Commune is Good," the sculpture in front of Qingyang Normal School is "The Worker-Peasant Alliance," the sculptures on construction sites are heroic and model figures, and the sculptures in the countryside celebrate the bumper harvest. These beautiful reliefs have become places for the masses to appreciate.

Why can relief activities be launched among the masses? On the one hand, sculpture itself is a beautiful work of art. After the realization of communization, the relations of production have undergone new changes. The masses have not only improved in material life, but also demanded improvement in spiritual life. For example, the workers of the North Canal reflected: we must not only have water conservancy, but also afforestation, beautification, and fragrance. Therefore, relief has become the most ideal, most loved, and most appreciated thing for them. Moreover, sculpture has a long tradition in Gansu. In the past, people used it to beautify villages and rooms, and to create reliefs or sculptures of "tigers" and "lions" at their doorsteps to decorate their environment. This tradition is now being used to reflect the real life and romantic spirit of the people. On the other hand, there are also favorable conditions: First, the Dongzhi Plateau is known as the Loess Plateau, and the soil is firm, fine, and easy to carve, which can withstand wind and rain and last for a long time; second, the carving tools are simple, mostly hoes, iron shovels, iron knives, and iron spades, which are commonly used farm tools by farmers; third, it does not take up the whole day, and can be done during breaks; fourth, it is combined with reality, using local materials, and carving whatever is available, without being bound by any rules and regulations.

Although sculpture has a long history and favorable conditions, it is still far from serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving politics, and serving production. During the construction of the North Canal, a worker named Wang Yuzhong used the fine soil and easy excavation to carve a relief during his rest. Thus, one person told ten, and ten told a hundred, and a carving and sculpture activity was formed on the canal with tens of thousands of workers. This greatly improved work efficiency. This attracted the attention of the leadership. At the county cultural conference in August, specific discussions were held, and a plan was made to complete 6,000 reliefs and 1,200 sculptures this year. The communes also made arrangements. Xu Tiantang, a 70-year-old from Dongzhi Commune, carved four reliefs in fifteen days. Zhang Xuemin, a twelve-year-old, sculpted a complete set of reliefs of "Little Jinggang Mountain." Commune members said: sculptures used to be things in the homes of landlords and rich peasants, but now we have them ourselves. If Chairman Mao hadn't led us, there wouldn't be such a thing.

The emergence and development of new things is never smooth sailing. There are many obstacles in work and thought. For example, some people say: "We are so busy with production, where can we find the time to do it?" "How can farmers who are unsophisticated do sculpture?" Later, after discussions, we struggled against various erroneous ideas. Under the leadership of the Party, the sculpture activity was still carried out and was loved by the masses.

Commune members produce during the day and sculpt at night. In order to further popularize it, the method of masters teaching apprentices was adopted. The old artist Xu Tiantang took three apprentices. We combine the professional and the amateur, the urban and the rural, and the school and the commune, and adhere to the principle of doing whatever we do and doing it wherever we go. Now, there are three hundred people who can basically do it themselves. The Xifeng Commune plans three steps: The first step is to organize everyone to study basic knowledge, discuss and research, and invite old artists to explain the basic methods of operation; the second step is to experience creation by ourselves, first making small models for everyone to study and modify; the third step is to copy according to the models, learning and creating at the same time.

Carving and sculpture are powerful weapons for implementing the policy of serving politics and serving production. Many excellent works have already emerged in the Qingyang County sculpture creation movement.

    庆阳县群众的雕塑艺术
    庆阳县文教局局长　白纪才
    庆阳县是甘肃省陇东一个半山半塬的老解放区，5月间县委号召全县人民：能写的写，能唱的唱，能画的画，能刻的刻，大力开展群众文艺活动。为了把农村装饰的丰富多彩，美化农村，掀起了雕塑、雕刻、浮雕群众运动，至10月统计已搞成四千二百九十座。
    在汽车站上的雕塑是“人民公社好”，在庆阳师范门前的雕塑是
  “工农联盟”，在工地上的雕塑是英雄模范人物，在农村的雕塑是庆丰收。这些美丽的浮雕就变成了群众欣赏的场所。
    为什么在群众中能够搞起浮雕活动？一方面雕塑本身就是美观的艺术品。实现了公社化后，生产关系又起了新的变化，群众不仅在物质生活方面提高，而且在精神生活上也要求提高。如北干渠民工反映：不仅要水利化，还要绿化、美化、香化。因此，浮雕就成了他们最理想最喜爱最欣赏的东西了。而且雕塑在甘肃有悠久的传统。过去人们利用它美化村庄，美化房间，在自己门口搞浮雕或雕塑“虎”、“狮”装饰自己的环境。这种传统今天被利用来反映人民群众的现实生活和浪漫主义气概。另一方面也有有利条件：一、董志塬号称黄土高塬，土质坚硬精细，雕刻能够经得起风吹雨淋，经久耐时；二、刻用工具简便，多用镢头、铁锨、铁刀、铁铲，都是农民常用的农具；三、可以不占用整天时间，借休息就可进行；四、结合实际，就地取材，有啥刻啥，不受任何清规戒律的拘束。
    雕塑虽有悠久的历史和优越的条件，但对面向工农兵服务，为政治服务，为生产服务还是很不够的。修筑北干渠道中，在休息时民工王毓忠借用土质细，出土方便就刻了一幅浮雕。于是一传十，十传百，在万人民工的渠道上就形成了雕刻雕塑活动。大大的提高了工效。这样就引起了领导上的注意。8月县文化会议上又进行具体讨论，计划今年搞浮雕六千个，雕塑一千二百座的指标。各公社又作了安排，董志公社七十岁徐天堂十五天中就雕刻了四座浮雕。十二岁张学敏塑成“小?岗山”的全套浮雕。社员们说：雕塑是过去地主、富农家中的东西，现在我们自己也有了，不是毛主席来领导那有这么一回事。
    新的事物出现，发展起来总不是一帆风顺的，有好多工作上和思想上的阻力。如有人说：“生产这么忙，那有时间搞它”、“农民土里土气怎能搞雕塑”。后来经过了讨论，对着各种错误思想进行了斗争。在党的领导下，雕塑活动仍然得到了开展，受到了群众的喜爱。
    社员白天生产，利用夜晚雕塑。为了更大的普及，就采用师傅带徒弟的办法，徐天堂老艺人带了三个徒弟。做到三结合，即专业和业余相结合，城镇和乡村相结合，学校和公社相结合，坚持做什么搞什么，到那里搞在那里的原则。现在有三百人基本能够自己搞了。西峰公社计划三个步骤：首一步是组织大家学习基本知识，讨论研究，请老艺人讲操作基本方法；二步是由自己体验创作，先做成小样子，大家研究修改；三步按照样子临摹，边学习边创作。
    雕刻、雕塑都是贯彻为政治服务，为生产服务的有力武器。在庆阳县的雕塑创作运动中已经出现了不少优秀的作品。
