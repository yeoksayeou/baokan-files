A Quarrel Caused by "Poor Relatives"
Xi Linsheng

    Recently, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, praised by Dulles as conducting "close cooperation," has stirred up another major quarrel because of a letter from French Prime Minister de Gaulle. In this letter to the heads of the US and British governments, de Gaulle requested that the US-British leadership core within the North Atlantic group be expanded into a "three-headed core" of the US, Britain, and France. In other words, things should not be decided solely by the US and Britain; France should also have a voice and decision-making power, and play a leadership role.

    De Gaulle's action is, of course, eye-catching. One who was considered a poor relative of the North Atlantic group, who has always relied on American aid, now actually wants to sit on an equal footing with the American boss and issue orders to other countries. This has angered its "allies." For a time, governments and newspapers of various countries rose up to oppose de Gaulle's request. Some said politely that they had "not much enthusiasm" or "expressed indifference." Some were "firmly opposed." And West Germany, with the greatest anger, expressed a "cold reservation" and "blunt disapproval."

    In reality, although France has nominally remained one of the three major Western powers in recent years, its status is quite pitiful. Within the North Atlantic nations, some have long been saying: the outdated concept of the "three major powers" should die. In fact, some countries simply do not take France seriously. Last year, the US and Britain sent weapons to Tunisia without consulting France, undermining France's interests. This year, when the US and Britain carried out armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, not only did they not consult with France, but when France sent warships to Lebanon to try to intervene after the fact, they were driven back by the US. If such a humiliating thing had happened to previous French governments, they would have had to swallow their anger. But now it is de Gaulle who is in power. De Gaulle's rise to power is actually a desperate struggle by French monopoly capital to revive its domestic and international status, and he has considerable ambitions in terms of external expansion. Moreover, the trump card that de Gaulle is playing domestically is his so-called "national diplomacy" policy. The US and Britain's lack of respect for France naturally aroused de Gaulle's dissatisfaction. Therefore, since he came to power, de Gaulle has fired three cannons in diplomacy: the first was in July this year on the issue of convening a summit of heads of government, where France disagreed with the US and Britain's proposal to hold a meeting within the United Nations, insisting that the summit be held "in Europe," and it also actively campaigned in Western European countries, wanting to act as the "spokesman for Western European countries" at the summit; the second was that France, regardless of the opposition of its "allies," decided to build atomic bombs, wanting to squeeze into the "nuclear club" and become one of the atomic powers; the third is the request made in de Gaulle's letter now.

    Of course, de Gaulle is also aware of his own limitations. He knows that his foundation is weak, and he lacks the capital to achieve the above-mentioned goals. But he has accurately identified one point, which is that other Western European "allies" of the North Atlantic group, especially West Germany and Italy, are also dissatisfied with the US and Britain monopolizing the leadership of the North Atlantic organization, which he can use. For example, at the North Atlantic group summit at the end of last year, Western European countries were greatly angered by the US allowing Britain to play the leader of Western Europe and monopolizing the manufacture of core weapons of the North Atlantic group together with Britain. At the meeting, West Germany and other Western European countries formed a "continental front" to confront the "US-British alliance," and proposed strengthening "mutual consultation" among the countries in the North Atlantic group. At the same time, in order to deal with the US-British attempt to monopolize nuclear weapons, West Germany even established a "three-nation arms alliance" with France and Italy, preparing to manufacture nuclear weapons. And in July this year, the US and Britain launched an armed invasion of Lebanon and Jordan without consulting their "allies" beforehand, which aroused the complaints of West Germany, France, and Italy. Therefore, de Gaulle believes that he can use this contradiction and the old relationship between France, West Germany, and Italy to form a "continental front" led by him to confront the "US-British alliance," thereby achieving the goal of reviving France's international prestige.

    However, de Gaulle's calculation is obviously wrong. Forming a Western European "continental front" to confront the "US-British alliance" and opposing Britain and the US from jointly controlling the leadership of the North Atlantic group was originally a play directed by West Germany. Although West Germany has tried its best to woo and collude with France, it only wants France to play a supporting role, in order to give Adenauer more capital to act as the leader of Western Europe. But now de Gaulle wants to grab the lead role, which will naturally make West Germany, which is stronger than France, very dissatisfied. Therefore, de Gaulle's plan has never received much support from West Germany, and it has aroused much more criticism and opposition from West Germany. West Germany initially said: the proposition of making Europe a third force led by France is not attractive, and then it severely criticized France's attempt to enter the "nuclear club." Even Adenauer deliberately postponed his meeting with de Gaulle because of this matter. And now de Gaulle's "three-headed core" plan has made West Germany even more angry.

    However, it must be said that the West German government still has some discretion in dealing with de Gaulle. On the one hand, because the West German government sees through that this poor relative has no great ability, just like the donkey in Aesop's fables that wears a lion's skin, it looks fierce, but in fact it is just a donkey. France has to rely on West Germany in many places to realize its ambitious plans. In the recent meeting between de Gaulle and Adenauer, France leaned closer to West Germany again.

    On the other hand, West Germany's main opponent is still Britain, and competing with Britain for the second chair is still the true thinking of West German monopoly capital, and in this struggle, West Germany still has a place where de Gaulle can be used. Moreover, France's opposition to the US and Britain's monopoly of power and its call for the US and Britain to strengthen consultation with other "allies" is also very much to West Germany's liking. Therefore, although West German newspapers have fiercely opposed de Gaulle's proposal, the West German government has adopted a subtle attitude. It seems that it has used a double-sided approach, being both "sympathetic" and opposed to de Gaulle's proposal. For example, what Adenauer and West German Foreign Minister Brentano have said recently are so-called "expressions of approval" and "feeling happy," etc. Because the West German government also believes that the "political consultations" between the members of the group should be strengthened, they feel that the current "political consultation" procedures are "inadequate and inappropriate." This so-called "expression of approval" and "feeling happy" is obviously exerting pressure on the US and Britain, especially on Britain, to take out a portion of the leadership power. West Germany is confident that because of its relationship with the US and its economic strength, it will inevitably have a share of this leadership power. This is one aspect. But de Gaulle's proposal is ultimately a step in France's expansion of power, and letting it succeed is detrimental to West Germany. What should be done? The West German government used a "borrowed knife to kill" plan. The West German government knew that if de Gaulle's letter was made public, it would be besieged by other North Atlantic group countries, thus making de Gaulle's plan a failure. Sure enough, the West German "Afternoon News," which has a close relationship with the West German Foreign Ministry, first "deliberately" revealed the contents of de Gaulle's letter. Then West German government spokesman Eckart "confirmed" it at a press conference, and with the West German newspapers stirring up trouble, the public opinion of European countries in the North Atlantic group rose up to attack France. Now the governments of Italy and Norway have also publicly opposed France's plan. The West German government has achieved the benefit of killing two birds with one stone here.

    The British government played a role in threading the needle in this quarrel. According to the French "L'Aurore" newspaper, de Gaulle's writing to the heads of the US and Britain was "told to (West German Foreign Minister) Brentano by Lloyd during President House's visit to London." It seems that Britain deliberately revealed it to the West German government. People know that West Germany has long been Britain's strong rival, and the contradictions between Britain and Germany run through many aspects of politics and economy. West Germany's organization of the European Common Market poses a greater threat to Britain. Britain wants to use the method of establishing a European Free Trade Area to protect its position. But in order to obtain West Germany's support for this plan, it must temporarily ease its tense relationship with West Germany and try to win over West Germany. Macmillan's visit to Bonn not long ago, singing high praises for forgetting past conflicts and showing the future, and the recent visit of West German President House to Britain are manifestations of this. On the other hand, the emergence of a Franco-German alliance on the Western European continent that opposes Britain also makes Britain extremely chilling. For Britain, which has always played the "balance of power policy," it is trying to alienate this alliance. Revealing the matter of de Gaulle's letter to West Germany can both please the West German government and provoke the relationship between France and Germany. Why not do it!

    The US government, of course, will not be happy with de Gaulle's memorandum. Because this will affect its "monopoly of supreme rule" in the North Atlantic group. But its current situation is very embarrassing. The dissatisfaction of its "allies" caused by its arbitrary actions in the Middle East has just subsided, and its unilateral decision to create tension in the Taiwan Strait has been met with even more severe criticism from its Western European "allies." The US position in the North Atlantic group is already precarious. What's worse is that the call to oppose the US's monopoly of leadership in the North Atlantic group is not just from de Gaulle alone; in fact, many "allies" are also complaining. If it publicly opposes France, it will inevitably arouse the dissatisfaction of other countries, making the current US situation even more isolated. Therefore, the US is currently silent on the one hand, and secretly using West Germany and other Western European countries to oppose France on the other.

    The infighting among the countries of the North Atlantic group caused by de Gaulle's letter is still continuing, and it seems that it will be difficult to resolve for a while. However, regardless of its outcome, it can only make the contradictions between imperialism increasingly sharp in the situation where the east wind prevails over the west wind, along with the decline of capitalism.

    “穷亲戚”惹起的一场争吵
    席林生
    最近，被杜勒斯称为了不起的“密切地进行合作”的北大西洋公约组织，为了法国总理戴高乐的一封信又惹起了一场大争吵。戴高乐在这封给美英两国首脑的信中要求把北大西洋集团中的美英领导核心扩大为美英法“三巨头核心”。也就是说不要什么事情光由美英两国决定，应该让法国也有发言权和决定权，也起些领导作用。
    戴高乐的这个行动当然惹人注目。一个被视为北大西洋集团的穷亲戚，一向靠了美国的接济过日子，现在居然想跟美国老板平起平坐，向其他国家发号施令起来。这可惹恼了它的“盟国”。一时各国政府和报纸都群起而反对戴高乐的这个要求。有的客气一点的说对之“劲头不大”或“表示冷淡”。有的是“坚决反对”。而火气最大的西德则表示了“冰冷的保留态度”和“露骨的不赞成”。
    说实在的，近年来法国在名义上虽然还是西方三大国之一，但是它的地位已是十分可怜了。在北大西洋国家中早已有人在叫：这个陈旧的“三大国”的概念应该死亡了。而事实上一些国家也根本不把法国放在眼里。去年美英两国没跟法国打个招呼就把武器送给了突尼斯，挖了法国的墙脚。今年美英武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦时，非但没有跟法国商量，而且在事情发生后法国派军舰到黎巴嫩想插上一手，竟也给美国撵了回来。这种丢面子的事如果发生在前几届法国政府身上那也只得忍气吞声。可是现在碰上的是戴高乐。戴高乐的上台实际上是法国垄断资本拼命力图重振它在国内外地位的一次挣扎，在对外扩张方面有着不小的野心。何况戴高乐在国内打的一张王牌又是标榜他的所谓“民族外交”政策。美英如此不重视法国，当然引起戴高乐不满。因此自他上台之后，戴高乐在外交方面一连放了三炮：第一炮是今年7月关于召开各国政府首脑会议问题上，法国跟美英要在联合国内举行会议的主张不同，坚持要首脑会议“在欧洲”召开，并且它还在西欧大陆各国积极活动，想在首脑会议上充当“西欧国家代言人”；第二炮是法国不顾它的“盟国”的反对，决定要制造原子弹，想以此挤入“核子俱乐部”，成为原子大国之一；第三炮就是现在戴高乐这封信中提出的要求。
    当然戴高乐也有自知之明。他知道自己底子虚弱，要想达到上述目的还缺乏本钱。但是他看准一点，就是北大西洋集团的其他西欧“盟国”，特别是西德和意大利对美国和英国垄断北大西洋组织的领导权也心怀不满，正可供他利用。譬如去年年底北大西洋集团首脑会议时，西欧大陆国家对于美国让英国扮演西欧的领袖，并和英国一起垄断北大西洋集团内核武器的制造权曾经大为愤怒。会上，西德曾和其他西欧国家组成“大陆阵线”来对抗“美英联盟”，提出加强北大西洋集团内各国间的“互相磋商”的要求。同时为了对付美英垄断核武器的企图，西德甚至和法国、意大利建立了“三国军备同盟”，准备制造核武器。而今年7月由于美英事前未跟它的“盟国”商量，就出动兵力武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，又引起西德、法国和意大利的满腹牢骚。于是戴高乐认为可以利用这种矛盾以及法国和西德、意大利的老关系来组成一个由他统领的“大陆阵线”来对抗“美英联盟”，从而达到重振法国的国际威望的目的。
    但是戴高乐的算盘显然是打错了。组成西欧的“大陆阵线”对抗“美英联盟”，反对让英国和美国一起把持北大西洋集团领导权原本是由西德主演的一出戏。虽然西德曾竭力拉拢和勾结法国，也不过是要法国当个配角，为的是让阿登纳有更多的资本来充当西欧的领袖。但是现在戴高乐却要抢着扮主角，这自然会使实力要比法国雄厚的西德大不满意。因此戴高乐的这一套计划始终未得到西德的多少支持，而惹起西德的批评和反对却要多得多。西德初则说：使欧洲成为一个由法国领导的第三种力量的主张并没有吸引力，继之又对法国想打入
  “核子俱乐部”的做法大加抨击。甚至阿登纳为了这件事还曾故意推迟同戴高乐的会谈。而现在戴高乐的“三巨头核心”计划更使西德愤怒。
    不过话要说回来，西德政府对待戴高乐还是有些分寸的。这一方面因为西德政府看透这个穷亲戚没多大能耐，就像是伊索寓言里所说的披上狮子皮的一只驴子，样子看来很凶事实上却只不过是一匹驴子。法国要实现它的野心计划许多地方还得要求助于西德。不久前戴高乐和阿登纳的会谈中，法国又向西德靠拢了一些。
    另一方面，西德最主要的对手还是英国，跟英国争夺第二把交椅还是西德垄断资本的真心思，而在这场斗争中，西德还有用得着戴高乐的地方。何况现在法国反对美英独揽大权，要美英加强同其他“盟国”商量这一点也很配西德的胃口。因此，对待戴高乐的主张西德的报纸虽然反对得相当凶，可是西德政府却采取了一个微妙的态度。看来它使用了两面手法，对戴高乐的主张是既“同情”又反对。例如最近从阿登纳和西德外长勃伦塔诺口里说出来的都是所谓“表示赞成”，“感到高兴”等等。因为西德官方也认为应该加强集团各成员国之间的“政治磋商”，他们觉得目前的“政治磋商”程序“不充分，不恰当”。这种所谓“表示赞成”“感到高兴”显然是对美英，特别是针对英国施加压力，要他们拿出一部分领导权来。西德自信由于它同美国的关系以及它的经济实力，这种领导权总少不了它一份。这是一方面。但是戴高乐的主张终究是法国扩张势力的一个步骤，让它得逞对西德不利。怎么办呢？西德政府就用了个“借刀杀人”之计。西德政府知道，如果把戴高乐的信公之于众一定会受到其他北大西洋集团国家的围攻，从而使戴高乐的计划流于破产。果然不久同西德外交部关系颇密切的西德“午报”首先把戴高乐的信的内容“故意”透露了出来。接着西德政府发言人埃卡特又在记者招待会上加以“证实”，再加上西德报纸一煽动，北大西洋集团的欧洲各国舆论也就对法国群起而攻了。现在意大利和挪威的政府也公开反对法国的计划。西德政府在这里是收到了一箭双雕之利。
    英国政府在这场争吵中起了穿针引线的作用。据法国“震旦报”说，戴高乐给美英首脑写信这件事是“劳埃德在豪斯总统访问伦敦期间告诉（西德外长）勃伦塔诺的”。看来英国是故意透露给西德政府知道的。人们知道，长期来西德一直是英国的劲敌，英德的矛盾贯穿在政治、经济许多方面。西德组织欧洲共同市场对英国的威胁更大了。英国就想用建立欧洲自由贸易区的办法来保护它的阵地。但是为了取得西德对这个计划的支持，必须暂时缓和一下它和西德的紧张关系，要设法拉拢西德。不久前麦克米伦到波恩访问时高唱要忘掉过去的冲突和展视未来的赞美诗，以及最近西德总统豪斯的访英就是这方面的表现。而另一方面，在西欧大陆上出现一个反对英国的法德同盟也使英国极为寒心。对于一贯玩弄“均势政策”的英国来说，就竭力企图离间这个同盟。把戴高乐的写信的事透露给西德，既可讨好西德政府，又能挑拨法德的关系。这何乐而不为呢！
    美国政府对戴高乐的备忘录当然不会感到高兴。因为这将影响它在北大西洋集团中“最高统治权的垄断地位”。但是目前它的处境很狼狈。由于在中东的独断行动引起它“盟国”的不满情绪刚平息，而在台湾海峡制造紧张局势的一意孤行又遭到它西欧“盟国”的更严厉的批评。美国在北大西洋集团中的处境正自不妙。更糟的是，反对美国独霸北大西洋集团领导权的呼声不仅是戴高乐一个人，实际上好多“盟国”也在抱怨。如果公开反对法国，那末势必会引起其他国家的不满，使目前美国的处境更加孤立。因此，美国目前一方面表示沉默，一方面又暗中利用西德和其他西欧国家来反对法国。
    现在围绕着戴高乐的信件而引起的北大西洋集团各国的内哄还在继续，看来一时还难以解决。不过无论其结局如何，它只能使帝国主义在东风压倒西风的形势下，随着资本主义的没落，它们之间的矛盾也越来越尖锐了。
