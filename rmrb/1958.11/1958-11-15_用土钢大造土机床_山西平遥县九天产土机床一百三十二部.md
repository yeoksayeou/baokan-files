Shanxi Pingyao County Produces 132 Indigenous Machine Tools in Nine Days

Taiyuan, November 13th (report from our newspaper) - In the midst of the vigorous "Four Indigenous" movement, Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, produced 132 indigenous machine tools in nine days, providing all seven people's communes with complete sets of working machine tools such as lathes, drills, planers, and milling machines. The masses happily composed a jingle to praise this achievement: "Indigenous methods and indigenous iron to refine indigenous steel, indigenous methods to manufacture indigenous machine tools, one hundred and thirty-two produced in nine days, seven factories built in one day."

In late June, the Pingyao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in response to the urgent need for labor force and the ball bearingization of machinery and transportation tools, decided to equip the rural communes, focusing on existing factories and communes, and adopting the method of "the hen lays eggs" – self-made machine tools. However, after the issue was raised, conservatives strongly opposed it, saying, "Making machine tools is not simple; only large factories can do it. Our technology is low, and our equipment is poor. What kind of machine tools can we make?" In response to this argument, the county committee decided to carry out a major debate in these units about where the world's first machine tool came from. Ideologically, they broke the superstitious idea that "only large machinery factories can make machine tools." Thus, in July, they equipped one township – Dapu Township. Five days after the factory was built in this township, ball bearingization was achieved. This fact shattered the conservatives' arguments. As a result, various townships and communes successively transferred personnel to the county to learn machine tool operation techniques, creating conditions for the comprehensive realization of machine toolization. At the end of October, the county overfulfilled the iron smelting plan, creating conditions for carrying out the "Four Indigenous" program. The county committee then decided, based on the provincial committee's instructions on carrying out the "Four Indigenous" movement, to mobilize the entire party and all the people to let the machinery marshal quickly take command. They first vigorously developed indigenous machine tools, and then ensured the realization of indigenous motors, indigenous machinery, and indigenous railways (the "Three-izations"). From November 1st to 9th, a mass movement to manufacture indigenous machine tools on a large scale was launched, and all the county's mechanical repair and manufacturing forces were thrown into this battle.

Once the movement unfolded, it was as vigorous as the battle to produce steel. The broad masses were enthusiastic, painstakingly researched, and repeatedly experimented. Party and government leading cadres personally participated. In the absence of raw materials, workers used waste materials and wood for the bed surfaces and legs. A single indigenous lathe saved more than 200 kilograms of pig iron. Everyone came up with ideas, and everyone engaged in creation, which became the norm. The broad masses not only imitated milling, planing, and drilling machines, electric welding machines, and plate rolling machines, but also creatively manufactured a four-purpose indigenous machine tool. This machine tool can both grind rice and mill flour, and can also be used as a grinding wheel machine, and can also turn planes. It is suitable for both industry and agriculture, and the masses named it the "Worker-Peasant Joint Machine Tool."

On November 9th, the county completed the task of manufacturing one hundred and thirty-two machine tools ahead of schedule. On the same day, the manufacturing personnel were divided into three groups and sent to the county's seven communes for installation. After installation, they were immediately put into production. Some communes used indigenous lathes to build factories and immediately produced indigenous lathes. (Photo attached)

    用土钢大造土机床
    山西平遥县九天产土机床一百三十二部
    本报太原13日电　山西省平遥县在大搞（四土化）运动中，九天之间制造出一百三十二部土机床，使七个人民公社都有了车、钻、刨、铣等全套的工作母机。群众高兴的编了一首顺口溜来赞颂：“土法土铁炼土钢，土法制造土机床，九天产了一百三，一天建起七个厂”。
    中共平遥县委在6月下旬，就针对劳动力紧张和机械及运输工具滚珠轴承化的迫切需要，决定以现有厂、社为主，采取母鸡下蛋、自造机床的办法来武装乡社。但问题提出后，保守派却极力反对，他们说：“造机床不简单，大厂子才能干得了，咱们技术低，设备差，还能造什么机床？”针对这种论调，县委决定在这些单位开展了世界上第一台机床从哪儿来的大辩论。从思想上打破了“只有大机械厂才能造机床”的迷信思想。于是，在7月份，便武装起了一个乡——达蒲乡。这个乡建厂后五天，就实现了滚珠轴承化。用事实粉碎了保守派的论点。于是各乡社纷纷抽调人员到县里，学习操作机床技术，为全面实现机床化创造条件。10月底全县超额完成了炼铁计划，为开展“四土化”创造了条件，县委便根据省委关于开展“四土化”运动的指示，决定全党全民动手，让机械元帅迅速升帐。并首先大搞土机床，然后保证土电机、土机械、土铁路等（三化）的实现。从11月1日到9日，开展了大规模制造土机床的群众运动，全县所有机械修造力量，都投入了这个战斗。
    运动一展开，就像大战钢铁一样轰轰烈烈，广大群众热情洋溢，苦心钻研，反复试验，党政领导干部亲自参加。在没有原料情况下，职工们用废料、木料作床面、床腿、仅一台土元车就节省灰生铁二百多公斤。人人想办法，个个搞创造，已成风气。广大群众不仅仿造成铣、刨、钻床，电焊机，卷板机，而且创造性地制造了四用土机床，这部机床既能碾米、磨面，又能代砂轮机，同时可以车平面。既适用于工业，又适用于农业，群众命名为“工农联合机床”。
    11月9日，全县提前完成了一百三十二台机床任务。当天，制造人员分三批到全县的七个公社进行安装，安装后立即投入了生产。有些公社用土车床建起工厂后，马上就又生产出了土车床。（附图片）
