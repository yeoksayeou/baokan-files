Xinhua News Agency, November 26th, Tokyo dispatch: Leading cadres of the Japan Socialist Party, including Chairman Mosaburo Suzuki, Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma, and Chairman of the Control Committee Kozo Inomata, held a meeting in Tottori City today to decide on the current struggle policy.

    In this struggle policy, the Socialist Party exposed that the Nobusuke Kishi government, under pressure from public opinion, recently stated that it was "not prepared to expand the defense area" when revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." This is to deceive public opinion and is not its true intention. The Socialist Party believes that the Nobusuke Kishi government's conspiracy to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is in line with its aggressive conspiracy to send troops abroad and implement a comprehensive war policy. The Socialist Party demands an immediate halt to negotiations on revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and firmly advocates the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." It stated that if the Nobusuke Kishi government submits a bill to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" to the ordinary session of the Diet, the Socialist Party will launch a national movement with even greater momentum than the struggle against the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill."

    The Nobusuke Kishi government has already decided to accelerate negotiations on revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in order to submit a bill to revise the treaty at the ordinary session of the Diet.

    Regarding the issue of prohibiting the transportation of nuclear weapons into Japan, this policy stipulates that the Socialist Party will cooperate with the National Federation to Protect the Constitution to submit a proposal to the ordinary session of the Diet to prohibit the transportation of nuclear weapons.

    The current struggle policy also states that the Socialist Party must be vigilant against the Nobusuke Kishi group's activities to re-submit the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" and must resolutely struggle to completely shatter the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill." In the Socialist Party's struggle to smash the Nobusuke Kishi government's conspiracy to revise the "Police Duties Execution Law," overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, and demand the dissolution of the Diet, the first priority is to successfully prevent the Nobusuke Kishi government's attempt to re-revise the "Police Duties Execution Law."

    In its current struggle policy, the Socialist Party pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi government's "Anti-Monopoly Law Amendment Bill" also became an unfinished bill for deliberation at the extraordinary session of the Diet and stated that it would resolutely oppose the Nobusuke Kishi government from re-submitting this bill to the Diet, which aims to suppress agriculture and small and medium-sized enterprises and safeguard the interests of monopoly capital.

    The Socialist Party also stated that it would hold the Nobusuke Kishi government accountable for deepening Japan's economic crisis at the ordinary session of the Diet. It will also resolutely oppose the Nobusuke Kishi government's conspiracy to revise the system of electing prefectural governors and attempt to appoint prefectural governors.

    Xinhua News Agency, November 26th, Tokyo dispatch: Chairman Mosaburo Suzuki of the Japan Socialist Party said on the 25th that the current situation in Japan is still at an important stage. He pointed out that if the Nobusuke Kishi government insists on revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," it will encounter more intense opposition than the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law."

    Suzuki made this statement to reporters upon arriving at Osaka Itami Airport. He was heading to Tottori Prefecture to support the Socialist Party candidate running for governor of Tottori Prefecture.

    In his remarks, Suzuki pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi government "once attempted to submit a series of reactionary laws, such as the 'Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill' and the 'Anti-Espionage Law,' to have them passed and lay a foundation where the people could not oppose, and then forcibly revise the (U.S.-Japan) 'Security Treaty.'"

    He mentioned that although the Nobusuke Kishi government was forced to temporarily shelve the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill," the crisis facing democratic politics due to the Nobusuke Kishi government's attempts to take measures such as revising the Constitution, and the crisis facing parliamentary politics due to the one-party dictatorship of the Liberal Democratic Party, have not been completely eliminated. In this regard, a prerequisite is that the Liberal Democratic Party change its usual attitude.

    Suzuki also accused the Liberal Democratic Party of "attempting to take actions such as revising the Diet Law to handle matters by law."

    On the 25th, Soji Okada, Director of the International Bureau of the Socialist Party, met with Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama and Chief Cabinet Secretary Munenori Akagi to submit the Socialist Party's written request to immediately stop negotiations on revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." This was proposed based on the decision of the Central Executive Committee meeting of the Socialist Party held on the 24th.

    日本社会党领导人决定当前斗争方针
    坚决反对岸信介修改日美“安全条约”
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎、书记长浅沼稻次郎、统制委员会委员长猪俣浩三等最高领导干部今天在鸟取市举行会议决定了当前斗争方针。
    社会党在这项斗争的方针中揭穿了岸信介政府由于受到舆论的压力，最近表示在修改日美“安全条约”的时候“不准备扩大防御地区”，这是为了欺骗舆论，并不是它的真意。社会党认为，岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋，是同它要派兵出国和推行全面战争政策的侵略阴谋一脉相通的，社会党要求立即停止关于修改日美“安全条约”的谈判，坚决主张废除日美“安全条约”。它表示，如果岸信介政府在国会平时会议上提出修改日美“安全条约”的议案，社会党就要展开比反对“警职法修正案”的斗争声势更加浩大的国民运动。
    岸信介政府已经决定要加紧进行修改日美“安全条约”的谈判，以便在国会平时会议上提出修改条约的法案。
    关于禁止把核武器运进日本的问题，这项方针规定，社会党将同拥护宪法国民联合会合作，向国会平时会议提出关于禁止运进核武器的提案。
    当前斗争的方针还表示，社会党要对岸信介集团所进行的再次提出“警职法修正案”的活动提高警惕，并且要坚决为彻底粉碎“警职法修正案”而斗争。并且在社会党所进行的粉碎岸信介政府修改“警职法”的阴谋、打倒岸信介内阁和要求解散国会的斗争中，首先要成功地阻止岸信介政府企图再次进行修改“警职法”的活动。
    社会党在它的当前斗争的方针中指出，岸信介政府的“禁止垄断法修正案”在国会临时会议上也成了审议未了的法案，并且表示要坚决反对岸信介政府再次向国会提出这个目的在于压迫农业和中小企业、维护垄断资本利益的法案。
    社会党还表示要在国会平时会议上追究岸信介政府加深日本经济危机的责任。并且坚决反对岸信介政府企图修改府、县知事选举的制度，企图由它来任命府、县知事的阴谋。
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎25日说，日本的目前形势仍处在重要阶段。他指出，如果岸信介政府硬要修改日美“安全条约”，将会遭到比修改“警职法”更加猛烈的反对。
    铃木在到达大阪伊丹机场时对新闻记者发表了这番谈话。他是前往鸟取县去支援社会党候选人竞选鸟取县知事的。
    铃木在谈话中指出，岸信介政府“曾经企图提出‘警察官职务执行法修正案’和‘防谍法’等一连串的反动法律，使它们获得通过，打好国民不能够加以反对的基础以后，强行修改（日美）‘安全条约’”。
    他谈到，虽然岸信介政府被迫暂时搁置“警职法修正案”，但是由于岸信介政府企图采取修改宪法等措施而使民主政治面临的危机，以及由于自由民主党一党独裁而使议会政治面临的危机都并没有完全消除，在这方面，先决条件是自由民主党改变一向采取的态度。
    铃木还指责自由民主党“企图采取修改国会法等行动来靠法律办事”。
    社会党国际局局长冈田宗司25日会见外务相藤山爱一郎和官房长官赤城宗德，提交社会党要求立即停止修改日美“安全条约”谈判的要求书。这是根据24日召开的社会党中央执行委员会会议的决定提出的。
