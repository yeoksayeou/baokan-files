    Bumper Harvest Scene in Altai Territory
    S. Shevchenko, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Soviet of the Altai Territory
    In February 1958, the "Resolution on Further Development of the Collective Farm System and Reorganization of Machine Tractor Stations" passed by the Central Plenary Session of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union won great support from the members of the collective farms in the Altai Territory. In that first month alone, Altai collective farms purchased 10,600 tractors, 12,000 grain combine harvesters, 14,900 seeders, 9,700 tractor plows, and many other agricultural machines from the machine tractor stations. In addition, the machine tractor stations transferred many specialized machine operator cadres to the collective farms.
    In the Altai Territory, seventy-seven technical repair stations were established to replace the machine tractor stations. These are state-owned enterprises that carry out large-scale repairs of various agricultural machines for collective farms. The technical repair stations have the obligation to promote new technologies to collective farms and supply spare parts, petroleum products, fertilizers, chemical poisons, etc. In addition to the above tasks, they also perform some specialized work according to the requirements of the collective farms.
  The Party and the government's new regulations on the reorganization of machine tractor stations and the procurement of agricultural products, namely increasing the procurement prices of agricultural products and a series of other important measures, have opened up broader possibilities for the further upsurge of Soviet agriculture. This year's achievements in this regard are better than any previous year.
    The Altai Territory has also achieved higher yields in the cultivation and harvesting of grain and other crops than in previous years. This year, the collective farms and state farms in the Kulunda Steppe—the main wheat-growing area of the territory—harvested two to three times more grain than last year. Many farms harvested an average of 20 to 25 quintals or more of grain per hectare. It should be pointed out that under the natural climatic conditions of Altai, it would have been considered excellent if a hectare could yield seven to eight quintals in the past.
    This year's harvesting work was carried out under very complex climatic conditions. During the most intense period of harvesting in September, the Altai Mountains were continuously hit by torrential rains. People had to sleep in the fields waiting for every moment suitable for harvesting. Everyone who could harvest participated in this work, including technicians and the wives of farm leaders, office workers, livestock breeders, industrial enterprise workers, Party workers, and university students. Senior students picked up the cut grain stalks that had been bent to the ground by the rain and scattered by the wind, and wiped clean the dirty parts of the combine harvesters. They did everything to reduce the workload of tractor drivers and combine harvester operators.
    Everyone spared no effort and worked with great enthusiasm. Here are a few examples:
    In the Kalinin Collective Farm in the Biysk District, a combine harvester operator named Nikonov fell ill during the most intense period of harvesting. His wife, Lidia Petrovna, who also knew about machines, put aside her housework and drove the combine harvester in the field, and she worked very well. When her husband recovered and returned to work on the combine harvester, Lidia Petrovna was transferred to another machine, and she worked on this throughout the summer. Her two daughters also helped with the harvesting work.
    In the Kuruginsky District, there were the Knyazev brothers, who were among the first to start picking up grain stalks at night. Later, many people followed their example. As a result, the work of picking up grain in the fields was completed twice as fast as originally planned. Vasilychenko, a combine harvester operator from the Don region who came to help the farmers in the Altai region, worked very carefully with his unit. Vasilychenko and his three comrades, thanks to good labor organization, harvested the amount of grain each day that used to require twelve people to complete. A well-known nationwide group of mechanics, including Socialist Labor Hero Semyon Pitnitsa and Socialist Labor Hero Maria Lopanova, as well as others, exceeded their quotas by one or two times.
    The technical repair stations provided great assistance in the work of the farms. They supplied spare parts and gasoline to the tractor teams and helped transport grain. Substations were set up in the farms furthest from the technical repair stations, where ready-made components and parts for welding engines, tractors, combine harvesters, and other machines were stocked. The so-called mobile machine repair teams carried out the repair of agricultural machines directly in the fields day and night, regardless of the weather.
    Thanks to the nationwide reforms in agriculture and the heroic labor of the mechanical workers, all farm members, and state farm workers, the state has obtained a large amount of agricultural products.
    The bountiful harvest obtained by the working people of the Altai Mountains will not only make it possible to increase the labor-day remuneration paid to farm members in agricultural products and currency, but also greatly increase the fund amount. In many farms, in order to be able to expand appropriations to develop public management, farm members refused to receive high labor-day remuneration. The rapid increase in funds has made it possible for farms to develop mechanical manufacturing plants, mechanized threshing grounds, and livestock farm construction. The farms themselves also build large-scale, well-equipped schools, hospitals, and childcare facilities. Now, radio is being installed more and more widely in rural areas, and expenditure on other cultural life needs is also constantly increasing.
    Farms are also paying more and more attention to developing orchards and livestock husbandry, these business sectors. In the Altai Mountains, there are now about five thousand hectares of orchards, while decades ago, farmers in the Altai Mountains did not know what it was like to plant apples in their own gardens. This year, fruit trees have been planted extensively in almost all areas of the Altai Territory. The new high-yield hybrid and cold-resistant fruit tree and fruit plant seeds cultivated by the Altai Fruit and Vegetable Nursery are being widely adopted.
    The working people of the Altai Territory, like all the people of the Soviet Union, are preparing for how to better welcome the forty-first anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. We are very happy to report to the motherland the situation of the working people completing the plan, their high labor enthusiasm, and initiative. At the same time, we are also very concerned about the prosperous new life of fraternal China and are proud of every labor achievement of our Chinese friends. We are delighted with the unprecedented high yields achieved by the hardworking Chinese farmers this year. On this occasion, we extend our warmest congratulations to our Chinese brothers through the "People's Daily" and wish them further achievements in the struggle for socialist construction, in this noble cause.

    阿尔泰边区的丰收图景
    阿尔泰边区苏维埃执行委员会主席  斯·谢夫钦科
    1958年2月，在苏联共产党中央全会上通过的“关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站”的决议，在阿尔泰边区的各集体农庄的庄员中赢得了极大的拥护和支持。阿尔泰集体农庄就在头一月中，从机器拖拉机站购买了一万零六百台拖拉机，一万二千台谷物联合收割机，一万四千九百台播种机，九千七百个拖拉机的犁和其他许多的农业机器。此外，机器拖拉机站调给集体农庄的，还有许多专门的机器操作干部。
    在阿尔泰边区，成立了七十七所技术修理站来代替机器拖拉机站。这是给集体农庄的各种农业机器进行大规模修理的国营企业。技术修理站有义务向集体农庄推广新的技术，供应零件、石油品、肥料、化学毒药等。除了上述任务以外，它还按照集体农庄的要求进行一些专门性的工作。
  党和政府关于改组机器拖拉机站和采购农产品的新条例、即提高农产品的采购价格及其他一系列重要措施，给苏联农业的进一步高涨打开了更加广阔的可能。今年在这一方面的成绩比过去任何一年都要好。
    阿尔泰边区在粮食及其他作物的栽培和收获方面，也获得了比往年更高的收成。今年，库隆达草原——这一边区的主要小麦耕作区——的集体农庄和国营农场丰收的粮食，比去年多二至三倍。许多农场在每公顷地里收割了平均二十至二十五公担或者更多的粮食。应当指出的是，在阿尔泰的自然气候条件下，从前由一公顷地里，假如能够收割七至八公担的话，那就是再好没有的了。
    今年的收割工作是在非常复杂的气候条件下进行的。在9月份收割最紧张的时期，阿尔泰山区不停地下着倾盆大雨。人们不得不睡在田间等候每一刻适宜收割的机会。凡是能进行收割的人都参加了这一工作。有技术人员和农场领导人的爱人，有办公室的工作人员、家畜饲养者、工业企业的工作人员、党的工作人员和大学生们。高年级的学生把那些被雨打弯在地上和被风吹散开来的割好的谷物秆都拣起来，又把联合收割机上的肮脏地方都擦干净，他们一切都为了减轻拖拉机手和联合收割机手的工作。
    大家都毫不吝惜自己的力量，干劲十足地进行劳动。下面就是几个例子。
    在比斯基区加里宁集体农庄有一位联合收割机师尼高诺夫在收割最紧张的时候病倒了，他的爱人丽基亚·彼得洛芙娜也懂得机器，这次她就放下了自己的家务事，在田里驾驶着联合收割机，并且工作得很好。当她丈夫病好后，仍回到联合收割机上工作时，丽基亚·彼得洛芙娜就调到另外的机器上，整个夏天她就从事这个工作。她的两个女儿也帮助了收割工作。
    在库鲁金斯基区有克尼亚捷夫三兄弟，他们是第一批开始在夜间进行拾拣谷物秆的工作。后来就有很多人效仿他们的榜样。结果在田里拾谷物的工作要比原计划所规定的快一倍。从顿河区来帮助阿尔泰区农民工作的联合收割机师华西里钦柯的联动机工作得非常妥贴。华西里钦柯和他的三个同志由于劳动组织得好，因此他们每天所收割的谷物量，在过去却需要十二个人才能完成。全国闻名的一个机械师小组，其中有社会主义劳动英雄谢苗·彼特尼扎和社会主义劳动英雄玛丽亚·洛帕诺娃以及其他一些人，他们的工作都超过了定额一、二倍。
    在农庄的工作中，技术修理站给予了很大的帮助。他们把备用零件和汽油供给拖拉机小组，还帮助运输粮食。在离开技术修理站最远的农庄中都设立了分站，那里备有锻接联动机、拖拉机、康拜因机及其他机器上的现成机件和零件。所谓机器巡回小组都直接在田里日夜地不管什么天气都进行农业机器的修理工作。
    由于在农业方面进行了全国性的改革和机械工人、全体庄员及国营农场工作人员的英勇劳动，国家获得了大量的农产品。
    阿尔泰山区人民劳动所获得的丰收不仅将有可能提高以农产品和货币支付给庄员的劳动日报酬，并且还可以大大地增加基金额。在许多农庄中，为了能扩大拨款来发展公共经营，庄员都拒绝接收高额的劳动日报酬。基金的急剧增长就使农庄有可能发展机械制造厂、机械化脱谷场、畜牧场的建设。农庄自己还建造大规模的、设备完善的学校、医院和托儿机构。现在，农村中愈来愈广泛地装设无线电，在其他文化生活需要方面的费用也不断地在增加。
    农庄也愈来愈注意发展果园业和畜牧业这些经营部门。在阿尔泰山区现在有五千公顷左右的果园，而在几十年以前阿尔泰山区的农民根本就不知道种植在自己花园中的苹果是什么东西。今年几乎在阿尔泰边区的所有区域中都大量地种植果树。广泛地采用阿尔泰果实蔬菜苗圃培植出来的新的高产杂交和耐寒的果树及水果植物的种子。
    阿尔泰边区的劳动人民和全苏人民一样在准备如何更好地迎接伟大的十月社会主义革命四十一周年。我们非常高兴地向祖国汇报劳动人民完成计划的情况、他们高度的劳动热情和积极性。同时，我们也十分关切地注视着兄弟中国繁盛的新生活，为中国朋友们每一个劳动成就而骄傲。我们对勤劳的中国农民在今年所达到的空前高产而感到欢喜。借此机会，我们通过“人民日报”向中国兄弟们致以最热烈的祝贺并祝他们在为社会主义建设的斗争中，在这崇高的事业中获得进一步的成就。
