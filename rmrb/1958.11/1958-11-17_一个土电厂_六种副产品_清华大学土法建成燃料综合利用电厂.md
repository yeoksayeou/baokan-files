Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch: The 2,000-kilowatt fuel integrated utilization experimental power plant built by teachers and students of Tsinghua University using indigenous methods has been successfully completed. A celebration meeting was held on the afternoon of the 16th.

Zhang Guojian, Deputy Director of the State Economic Commission, Wang Guangwei, Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission, Liu Aifeng, Vice Minister of Education, and Liu Lanbo, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, attended the meeting and delivered speeches. They congratulated the successful completion of the fuel integrated utilization indigenous power plant, and pointed out that its promotion throughout the country could not only alleviate the current power shortage, but also promote the development of the industrial and agricultural economy.

This power plant has five characteristics: First, it has many products. In addition to the power generation section, the power plant also has a chemical workshop and a cement workshop. Besides generating electricity, this power plant can also produce six kinds of by-products, including kerosene, light diesel, phenol, gas, tar, and cement. Second, the construction speed is fast. It took only eighty days from design to completion, while a foreign power plant with the same power generation capacity would take at least about a year. Third, the investment is small, totaling more than 680,000 yuan, with an investment of 300 yuan per kilowatt, which is half the price of a foreign power plant with the same power generation capacity. Fourth, it saves valuable materials, and the equipment is simple. This power plant utilizes an old village temple, and the boiler room is just a shed. Many structures of the boiler part are made of brick and stone instead of steel. The instruments and equipment in the power distribution and transmission sections, except for the motors and transformers, are all indigenized. Iron wire is used instead of copper wire, and wood, bamboo, and earthenware are used instead of steel. For example, the most complex high-voltage oil switch only uses water tanks, wooden boards, and treated soybean oil, but its performance is even better than foreign ones. Fifth, the cost is low, about 3.01 to 3.02 cents per kilowatt-hour, while the cost of the Qinghe Experimental Power Station with the same power generation capacity is 3.4 to 3.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Due to the low investment and many products, the entire investment of this plant can be recovered within nine months after it is put into production. Therefore, this fuel integrated utilization power plant provides a shortcut for rural people's communes to realize electrification, chemicalization, agricultural mechanization, and urban construction.

This fuel integrated utilization power plant was completed by Tsinghua University under the entrustment of the State Economic Commission, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and with the assistance of fifteen units including the Beijing Repair and Manufacturing Plant of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, and the Beijing Power Supply Engineering Office.

### 一个土电厂　六种副产品  清华大学土法建成燃料综合利用电厂

    一个土电厂　六种副产品
    清华大学土法建成燃料综合利用电厂
    据新华社16日讯　清华大学师生用土法建成的二千瓩燃料综合利用试验电厂胜利地完工了。在16日下午举行了庆祝会。
    国家经济委员会副主任张国坚，国家计划委员会副主任王光伟，教育部副部长刘皑风，水利电力部副部长刘澜波都到会讲了话。他们祝贺燃料综合利用土电厂的胜利建成；指出在全国推广不仅可以缓和目前电力紧张的状况，而且有利于推动工农业经济的发展。
    这个电厂具有五个特点：第一、产品多，这个电厂除了发电部分外，还有化工车间、水泥车间。这个电厂除了发电以外，还可以生产煤油、轻柴油、酚、煤气、焦油、水泥等六种副产品。第二、建设速度快，从设计到施工完成一共只用了八十天时间，而同样发电量的洋电厂至少得一年左右。第三、投资小，一共用了六十八万多元，每瓩投资量为三百元，比发电量相同的洋电厂便宜一半。第四、节约贵重材料，设备简陋。这个电厂利用一座旧土地庙，锅炉房只搭了一个棚子，锅炉部分许多结构都以砖石代替钢材，配电、输电部分的仪器设备除电机、变压器外也都全部土化了，以铁线代替铜线，以木、竹、缸瓦等材料代替钢铁，用牛皮纸代替绝缘纸。像最复杂的高压油开关，这里只用了水缸、木板和经过处理的豆油，可是它的性能比洋的还强。第五、成本低，每度电大约只有三点零一分到三点二分钱，而同样发电量的清河试验电站每度电的成本为三点四分到三点八分。由于投资省，产品多，这个厂的全部投资在投入生产后九个月内就可收回。因此，这个燃料综合利用电厂为农村人民公社实行电气化、化学化、农业机械化、建筑城市化提供了一条捷径。
    这座燃料综合利用电厂是清华大学接受国家经济委员会、水利电力部、中共北京市委的委托，并在水利电力部北京修造厂、北京供电工程处等十五个单位的协助下完成的。
