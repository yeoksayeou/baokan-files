Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch from New York: The Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly held a press conference yesterday. The head of the delegation, Zorin, issued a statement on the outcome of the General Assembly's discussion on disarmament.

Zorin said that the discussions in the Political Committee and the United Nations General Assembly have irrefutably proved that the immediate and universal cessation of nuclear weapons testing is the primary issue among all disarmament issues. The vast majority of representatives pointed out in their speeches that this issue should be resolved without delay. In addition to the representatives of socialist countries, the representatives of Asian and African countries such as India, Indonesia, the United Arab Republic, Iraq, Ghana, Morocco, and Saudi Arabia also advocated the unconditional and comprehensive cessation of nuclear weapons testing. Some European neutral countries and some Latin American countries also advocated the cessation of nuclear weapons testing. Even some member states of the military bloc led by the United States, such as Greece and New Zealand, had to express opinions in favor of the immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

At the same time, the discussion also showed that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France are unwilling to take any practical measures in disarmament, unwilling to stop nuclear weapons testing, and unwilling to reduce military budgets.

Zorin said that, however, the results of the voting on various proposals showed that the United States' policy did not receive the support of the UN member states that do not belong to the Western military bloc. The United States and Britain suffered a miserable moral defeat, and "on a most important international issue, the United States, Britain, and France are increasingly isolated from the countries of Asia, Africa, and Europe."

Zorin continued, although the United Nations General Assembly, due to the opposition of the United States and its allies, did not make a positive contribution to the solution of the basic issues of disarmament, it did pass a constructive decision to establish a disarmament committee with the participation of all UN member states. As everyone knows, this proposal was put forward by the Soviet delegation at the previous session of the United Nations General Assembly, but it was opposed by the delegations of the United States and other Western countries. Now that the General Assembly has unanimously adopted this decision, which can serve as the basis for effective cooperation in disarmament among all members of the United Nations, this is undoubtedly a positive step.

Zorin said that the primary lesson of the General Assembly's discussion on disarmament is that, under the current circumstances, all peace-loving countries and people of all countries should redouble their efforts and more firmly carry the struggle through to the end, strive to stop the arms race, especially the nuclear arms race, strive to stop atomic and hydrogen weapons tests, and strive to take other measures in disarmament to eliminate the danger of a new devastating war.

Zorin finally stated that the Soviet Union will do everything possible to strive for a positive solution to the disarmament issue that is conducive to peace and the security of all peoples.

    佐林谈联大讨论裁军问题结果
    停止核试验是全世界共同要求
    美英在道义上已遭惨败日益陷于孤立
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：苏联出席联合国大会代表团昨天举行记者招待会，团长佐林就大会讨论裁军问题的结果发表声明。
    佐林说，政治委员会和联合国大会的讨论，无可辩驳地证明了立即普遍停止核武器试验是所有裁军问题中首要的问题。绝大部分代表在发言时都指出，应刻不容缓地解决这个问题。除了社会主义国家的代表以外，主张无条件全面停止核武器试验的有印度、印度尼西亚、阿拉伯联合共和国、伊拉克、加纳、摩洛哥、沙特阿拉伯等亚非国家的代表。还有一些欧洲中立国家和一些拉丁美洲国家的代表也主张停止核武器试验。甚至美国领导的军事集团的某些成员国如希腊、新西兰等，也不得不发表了有利于立即停止核武器试验的意见。
    同时，讨论也表明：美国、英国和法国政府不愿意在裁军方面采取任何实际措施，不愿意停止核武器试验，也不愿意削减军事预算。
    佐林说，然而，各项提案表决的结果表明：美国的这种政策并没有得到不加入西方国家军事集团的联合国成员国的支持。美国和英国遭到了道义上的惨败，而且“在一个最重要的国际问题上，美国、英国和法国脱离了亚洲、非洲和欧洲的国家而日益陷于孤立”。
    佐林接着说，尽管联合国大会由于美国和它的盟国的反对而没有对裁军基本问题的解决作出积极的贡献，但是，它通过了一项关于建立所有联合国成员国参加的裁军委员会的建设性的决定。大家知道，这个建议苏联代表团曾经在联合国大会上届会议上提出过，但是遭到了美国和其它西方国家的代表团的反对。而现在大会已经一致通过了可以作为联合国所有成员国在裁军方面实行有效合作的基础的这项决定，这无疑是一个积极的步骤。
    佐林说，大会对裁军问题的讨论的首要教训是：在目前的情况下，所有爱好和平的国家和各国人民都应当加倍努力，加倍坚决地把斗争进行到底，争取停止军备竞赛，特别是停止核军备竞赛，争取停止原子武器和氢武器试验，争取在裁军方面采取其它措施来消除新的毁灭性战争的危险。
    佐林最后表示，苏联将尽一切力量争取裁军问题得到有利于和平和各国人民安全的积极解决。
