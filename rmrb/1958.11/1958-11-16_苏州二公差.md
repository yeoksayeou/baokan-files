Audience Comments:

　　The Shanghai opera "The Second Official of Suzhou" is adapted from the Min opera "Refining the Seal." I feel that in some scenes, it is richer than the original play. The satire and exposure of corrupt officials in the feudal era have been further developed through the form of a Shanghai opera. "The Second Official of Suzhou" adds some details, some of which are just amusing jokes, but some are exaggerations based on real life. It can be said to be a creative adaptation. There are also some parts that I feel are redundant, such as the opening scene, where too many wronged people appear, and the clues are too complicated, making it seem unfocused. Some lines in the play appropriately selected folk proverbs, such as "If you are reasonable, you can sue even your great-grandfather" and "Even the tigers in the Western Hills eat people," which is commendable. I believe this is a better traditional play organized by the Shanghai Dagong Shanghai Opera Troupe, although there are still shortcomings. (Chun)

### “苏州二公差”

    “苏州二公差”
    滑稽戏“苏州二公差”是根据闽剧“炼印”改编的。我觉得在某些场次，比原剧要丰富一些。对封建时代贪官污吏的讽刺和暴露，通过滑稽戏的形式，有了进一步的发展。“苏州二公差”则加添了一些细节，有些只是引人发笑的笑料，但有些是有生活根据的夸张。可说是具有创造性的改编。也有一些部分，觉得是多余的，比如开头一场，受冤的老百姓出场太多，头绪纷繁，反而显得不集中。剧中有些台词恰当地选择了民间谚语，像“有理可以打太公”“西山老虎也要吃人”等，是值得赞扬的。我以为这是上海大公滑稽剧团所整理的一个较好的传统剧目，虽则还有缺点。（春）
