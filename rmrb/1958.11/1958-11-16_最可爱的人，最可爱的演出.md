The Most Beloved People, The Most Beloved Performance

In the capital's theaters these past few days, a new brilliance has shone forth. The literary and artistic soldiers standing on the front lines of our struggle – the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Political Department Art Troupe – have brought to the people of the capital their newest and most beautiful music, dance, and drama, woven with blood and sweat.

I have heard thousands of beautiful songs sung, and seen countless wonderful dances performed, but never have I been as moved as when I saw their performance this time. They sing the paean of triumph of the brotherly peoples of two socialist countries fighting shoulder to shoulder against American imperialism, they dance the deep affection of two nationalities linked by flesh and blood. Especially the nine-scene song and dance newsreel "Volunteer Army Battle Song" is a vivid and profound lesson in patriotism and internationalism for every audience member.

Similarly, the drama "Friendship" is also performed with simplicity and vitality, without the slightest affectation, vividly expressing the great friendship of the Chinese and Korean peoples, connected by flesh and blood and sharing weal and woe. Moving scenes unfold one after another on the stage: volunteer medical personnel rescuing a Korean woman in difficult childbirth, soldiers vying to give her blood transfusions, making clothes and toys for the baby; a Korean old woman sheltering a wounded volunteer platoon leader, showing no fear even when the enemy threatens to kill her grandson if she doesn't kill the platoon leader; a Korean woman risking her life to guide the volunteer army, rescuing the volunteer platoon leader. ... The audience was deeply attracted by these admirable characters and moving plots, everyone holding their breath, moved to tears.

Thank you to the comrades of the Volunteer Army Art Troupe for giving us such a wonderful gift, which has given us a profound internationalist education, and allowed us to see the most beloved people, and the most beloved performance.

    最可爱的人，最可爱的演出
    首都的舞台上，这几天又放射出新的光彩，站在我们斗争最前线的文艺战士——中国人民志愿军政治部文艺工作团，给首都人民带来了他们用血和汗编织成的最新最美的音乐舞蹈和话剧。
    我曾听过千百首优美歌曲的演唱，也曾看见过无数美妙舞蹈的表演，但是，没有一次能像这一回我看到他们演出时那么激动。他们歌唱的是两个社会主义国家兄弟般人民并肩打击美帝国主义的凯歌，他们舞蹈的是两个民族血肉相连的深情。特别是九场歌舞活报“志愿军战歌”，对每一个观众都是一堂生动而又深刻的爱国主义和国际主义课程。
    同样，话剧“友谊”也是演得朴实、生动，没有丝毫做作，把中朝人民血肉相连、患难与共的伟大友谊活灵活现地表达出来了。舞台上动人的场面一个接着一个：志愿军医务人员抢救难产的朝鲜妇女，战士争着为她输血，为婴儿制衣服、做玩具；朝鲜老大娘掩护志愿军受伤的排长，在敌人拿着手枪威胁要她打死她的孙子的时候，丝毫也不畏惧；朝鲜妇女冒着生命的危险为志愿军带路，营救志愿军排长。……观众被这些可敬的人物和感人的剧情深深地吸引住了，大家屏息着呼吸，感动得流下眼泪。
    感谢志愿军文工团的同志们给我们这样好的礼物，使我们受到了一次深刻的国际主义教育，看到了最可爱的人，最可爱的演出。
