    Building the Stairway to People's Communes
    Pastoral Areas Launch a Massive Merger and Association Movement
    (Our dispatch) In order to prepare conditions for the transition to people's communes, the pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, covering more than 900,000 square kilometers, are launching a massive merger and association movement. Of the original 2,280-plus small pastoral production cooperatives in the region, 1,358 have already merged into over 90 large cooperatives that combine townships and cooperatives into one, integrating industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, while retaining a partial private ownership system. The merger work of the remaining 900-plus small cooperatives will also be completed in the near future.
    The scale of the large cooperatives is generally between 100 and 300 households, with the largest having more than 800 households, and some with a single Sumu (district) being a single cooperative. The number of livestock entering the cooperatives has generally reached more than 90% of the total number of livestock. Compared with the past, when only 10% to 30% of the total number of livestock entered the cooperatives, this has greatly expanded the proportion of collective ownership, which has further consolidated the socialist system in the pastoral livestock economy.
    At present, the newly built large cooperatives (or associated cooperatives) have all established social welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, homes for the elderly, and veterinary and health teams (stations). Some have implemented the "three-izations"—organizational militarization, action combatization, and life collectivization. A large number of women have been liberated from labor, fundamentally overcoming the contradiction of "small cooperatives, weak strength" that could not adapt to the situation of the Great Leap Forward. This year, the livestock in pastoral areas have generally reached 80% to 90% fatness and have achieved full pregnancies of female animals. The amount of hay harvested is also twice as much as last year. More than 300,000 new sheds and enclosures have been built. In the pastoral areas of Zhaowuda League, 335 processing plants for dairy products, fur, grain, timber, and bricks have been established, making the grassland economy appear prosperous. After the merger, many cooperatives immediately invested in developing feed bases, selecting settlement points, building permanent housing, and running schools.
    The herdsmen are very enthusiastic about merging cooperatives, and many pastoral cooperatives have automatically united to carry out production. Party committees at all levels in the autonomous region have adopted the principle of "warmly welcoming and actively leading" and have strengthened specific leadership.

    搭起通向人民公社的阶梯
    牧区展开声势浩大的并社联社运动
    本报讯　为过渡到人民公社准备条件，内蒙古自治区九十多万平方公里的草原牧区，正在开展声势浩大的并社、联社运动。全区原来二千二百八十多个小牧业生产合作社中，已有一千三百五十八个社合并成为乡社合一、工农商学兵五位一体、保留部分私有制度的大社九十多个。其余九百多个小社的并社工作，也将在最近期间内完成。
    大社规模一般是一百户到三百户，最大的有八百多户，有的一个苏木（区）就是一个社。入社牲畜一般已达到总牲畜头数的90％以上。这和以前入社牲畜只占总头数的10％到30％相比较，大大扩大了集体所有制的比例，这就更巩固了牧区畜牧业经济中的社会主义制度。
    现在，新建的大社（或联社）都办起了公共食堂、托儿所、幸福院和兽医卫生组（所）等社会福利事业，有些已实行了三化——组织军事化、行动战斗化和生活集体化。解放出大批妇女劳动力，从根本上克服了过去“社小、力量薄”，不能适应大跃进形势的矛盾。今年牧区畜膘均达到了八至九成，并实现了母畜满怀。打草也比去年多一倍。新修棚圈已达三十多万个。昭乌达盟牧区现在已办起乳品、皮毛、粮米、铁木和砖瓦等加工厂三百三十五个，使草原经济呈现一片繁荣景象。还有许多社合并后，立即投入了开垦饲料基地，选择定居点，修建定居房屋和兴办学校等工作。
    牧民在并社中，情绪十分高涨，许多牧业社自动联合起来进行生产。自治区各级党委采取“热诚欢迎，积极领导”的方针，加强了具体领导。
