Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson, in a talk with CBS on the 3rd, once again emphasized that the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique would not take "offensive action" against the Chinese mainland without U.S. consent. He said: "I believe any offensive action would be taken in accordance with the terms stipulated in the letters we (the U.S. and Chiang) exchanged in 1955." This exchange stipulated that the use of force against the Chinese mainland, unless for "self-defense," must be done after "mutual agreement." Robertson also said that so-called "offensive action" included sending troops to "aid anti-communist rebellions on the mainland."

The day before Robertson's talk, Chen Cheng, "Vice President" of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique, told Agence France-Presse in Taipei that if the Chinese people were to liberate the coastal islands, the Chiang Kai-shek clique would "bomb the mainland," and "eight or nine times out of ten, there will be no time to consult with our American allies." Prior to this, officials of the Taipei Chiang Kai-shek clique had repeatedly argued against the declarations in the Dulles-Chiang Kai-shek talks communiqué, saying that the Chiang Kai-shek clique "had not unconditionally renounced the use of force against the mainland."

In his broadcast talk, Robertson also attempted to conceal the U.S. plot to create "two Chinas" by using the excuse of not giving China "diplomatic recognition." He said that the U.S.'s practice of "maintaining the independence of the Taiwan Nationalist government" did not mean adopting a "two Chinas" policy. However, he also said that the U.S.'s attitude toward China was the same as its attitude towards the two governments in divided Germany and Korea, recognizing only one of them (i.e., West Germany and South Korea). Robertson then boasted that "diplomatic recognition of a country by the United States is a privilege, not a right," and that since "Communist China simply does not meet the requirements of the United States," the U.S. government would never recognize the People's Republic of China. Robertson hysterically cursed that "China's communist regime will inevitably be overthrown in the end," and added, "this may take a very long time."

### “不使用武力”的把戏演成闹剧  美蒋各执一词争吵不休

    “不使用武力”的把戏演成闹剧
    美蒋各执一词争吵不休
    新华社4日讯　美国助理国务卿罗伯逊3日对哥伦比亚广播公司发表谈话，再次强调台湾蒋介石集团如果没有得到美国同意不会对中国大陆采取“攻势行动”。他说：“我认为任何攻势行动都会根据我们（美蒋之间在1955年）交换信件中规定的条款来采取。”这项信件规定除非为了“自卫”必须经“共同协议”后才能对中国大陆使用武力。罗伯逊并且说，所谓“攻势行动”包括出兵“援助大陆上的反共叛乱”在内。
    在罗伯逊发表谈话的前一天，台湾蒋介石集团“副总统”陈诚在台北对法新社记者说，如果中国人民着手解放沿海岛屿，蒋介石集团就要“轰炸大陆”，而且“十之八九将没有时间同我们的美国盟友商量”。在这以前，台北蒋介石集团官员针对着杜勒斯蒋介石会谈公报中的宣告已经一再辩解说，蒋介石集团“并没有无条件放弃对大陆使用武力”。
    罗伯逊在广播谈话里还企图以不给中国以“外交承认”为理由，来掩盖美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋，他说，美国“保持台湾国民党政权的独立”的做法并不意味着采取“两个中国”的政策。但是，他又说，美国对中国的态度跟它在分裂的德国和朝鲜的两个政府中只承认其中一个（即西德和南朝鲜）的态度一样。罗伯逊接着吹嘘“美国在外交上承认一个国家是一个特权，而不是权利”，而且由于“共产党中国根本不符合美国的要求”，美国政府决不承认中华人民共和国。罗伯逊歇斯底里地咒骂“中国的共产党政权最后一定会被推翻”，又说，“这可能要花很长时间”。
