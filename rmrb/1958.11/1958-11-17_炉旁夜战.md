    Night Battle by the Furnace
    By our reporter Ma Guofan
    In the deep autumn night, the Guguan Steel Plant in the Taihang Mountains is as radiant as the morning glow in spring. The thunderous large electric motors drive the blowers, injecting air through underground pipes into rows of iron-smelting furnaces and small steel-making furnaces. Instantly, the furnace fire blazes, and molten steel splashes, illuminating the thirty-acre construction site as if it were daytime. Here, thousands of steelworkers, who have been fighting fiercely for twenty days and nights, have a few beads of sweat rolling down their faces illuminated by the red light, but there is no sign of fatigue.
    Another fierce night battle has begun. This scene, which people call "steel flowers splashing like stars in the sky, molten iron flowing like gold on the ground," is set against the dark night sky, making it even more magnificent and spectacular.
    We arrived at the steel-making construction site of the motor vehicle workshop, where a red flag emblazoned with "High Quota, High Yield" was planted. Next to a small converter furnace spewing sparks, we saw Liu Yu, the secretary of the workshop's Party branch, helping workers improve the air ducts. Liu Yu pointed to the workers in front of the furnace and told us that they are multi-skilled workers who work as fitters, riveters, and ironworkers during the day, and automatically come to work as steelworkers at night. Liu Yu led us to a refining furnace with particularly vigorous flames. This is the furnace that has held the factory's "Big Satellite" flag for more than twenty days. Zhao Shubao, a Communist Party member and fitter, gripped the iron bar, panting and saying that tonight they would launch a high-yield "satellite" producing 400 jin per heat, and would compete with the "cadre furnace." Not long ago, the cadre furnace enlarged its hearth, and the yield per heat increased sharply from fifty or sixty jin to two hundred and seventy jin. Zhao Shutang's group immediately sent people to learn their method of modifying the furnace, and also narrowed the furnace mouth, eliminating the problem of air leakage, and the yield exceeded that of their competitors. Now the yield is often maintained at around three hundred and fifty jin. A person with a bandage wrapped around his neck and his right hand supported by a wooden board was loudly directing a group of people to transport and charge materials. It turned out that he was Hao Jinzhong, who was injured but refused to leave the front line. Hao Jinzhong, a member of the Communist Youth League, is a handyman who just came from the countryside. He and the cook built a refining furnace together. He volunteered to do all kinds of work such as 校铁 (checking iron), and 打铁 (iron work). Once, he took a molten and deformed iron bar from the furnace and cooled it in water. When he went to dig out the slag, the cold water entered the furnace, and the steel flowers exploded in the furnace, burning his face and right arm. The workers carried him to the hospital for treatment and asked him to rest. Unexpectedly, he returned to the furnace the next morning.
    The new steel-making furnace construction site urgently needed to connect to a high-voltage power line for blowing air and lighting. However, the factory did not have special insulation equipment, and connecting the high-voltage line required a complete power outage of the factory. Zhang Genqing, a Communist Party member and veteran electrician, thought: connecting this high-voltage line would take at least twenty minutes of power outage. This time is not short! How can the steel-making and iron-smelting furnaces of the whole factory be stopped to connect the power line? Zhang Genqing immediately put on a pair of ordinary insulated shoes, put on rubber gloves, and climbed the utility pole to erect the high-voltage power line. Some people dissuaded him from this action. He always felt that he had not fulfilled his responsibility if he did not connect this line.
    He politely and earnestly declined the dissuasion of the people, and finally safely connected the power line. When the task was urgent, he often stayed at the construction site day and night, and even did not want to leave the utility pole to rest. He carried a broken mat with him, and when he was so tired that he could not hold on, he would lie down on the broken mat to rest for a while before continuing to work. Not long ago, the secretary of the workshop's Party branch saw that his eyes were red and swollen and ordered him to go home to rest. He went home at twelve o'clock in the evening and came to the construction site early the next morning. He said to others: "Such a mass steel-making upsurge, what does it matter if you don't sleep for a few nights; it's better to 'suffer' a little now, so that it will be 'sweet' in the future."
    On the west side of the construction site, next to the steel-making furnace emitting blazing flames, there are two flags fluttering in the wind above a mat shed: one is the Red Cross flag, and the other is a peach-red flag with white characters "Steel Vanguard." The origin of this award flag aroused our interest. A female comrade wearing a white hat, who was sorting out first-aid kits for external injuries in the mat shed, told us: This award flag was given to them by the construction site headquarters. They came here from the first day of the construction of the steel-making furnace, shouldering the dual task of steel-making and first-aid treatment. At first, they tried hard, but they could not make any steel at all. Difficulties did not scare them, on the contrary, their will became stronger. They put forward heroic slogans to encourage each other: "The construction site is like Shangganling, we are like the Volunteer Army, in order for the steel commander to raise his tent early, we are willing to die on the battlefield." One night, Liu Chungui, the principal of the worker's children's school, was suddenly burned on the head by the ejected molten steel, and his hair and eyebrows were also burned. At this time, Liu Xiaoceng, a surgeon and Communist Party member who was making steel, put down the steel bar in his hand, escorted Liu Chungui to the hospital, personally applied medicine, bandaged, gave injections, and arranged for him to rest. After that, he rushed back to the steel-making site. Female nurses Zhang Ping, Wu Zhenyun and registrar Cao Yun, with the help of male comrades, also built a "March 8th" small indigenous open-hearth furnace, which produced 700 kilograms of steel a day. Now, the number of steel-making furnaces for medical staff has increased from the initial two to six. (Attached picture)

    炉旁夜战
    本报记者　马郭范
    深秋夜晚，太行山区的故县钢铁厂恰似春日朝霞，光彩万丈。轰鸣震耳的大型电动机带动鼓风机，通过地下的管道，注入一排排熔铁炉和小型炼钢炉。霎时，炉火熊熊，钢花飞溅、把三十亩工地照得如同白昼。在这里，已经酣战了二十昼夜的几千炼钢工人，在红光映照的脸上滚出几粒汗珠，却看不出一点倦意。
    一场激烈的夜战又开始了。这种被人们称为“钢花飞溅满天星，铁水奔流遍地金”的景色，衬托在漆黑的夜空里，显得更加雄伟、壮丽。
    我们来到插着“高额丰产”红旗的机动车间炼钢工地。在一座火花飞腾的小转炉旁边，看到了车间党支部书记刘瑜正在帮助工人改进风道。刘瑜指着炉前工人向我们说，他们是多面手的工人，白天当钳工、铆工、铁工，晚上又自动跑来当炼钢工人。刘瑜领着我们走到一座火苗特别旺盛的炒钢炉前。这是保持了二十多天全厂“大卫星”旗的炉子。共产党员、钳工赵树宝紧握着铁杆气喘吁吁地说，我们今天晚上要放每炉产四百斤的高产“卫星”，要和“干部炉”比比高低。不久前，干部炉改大了炉膛，每炉产量由五、六十斤猛增到二百七十斤。赵树堂小组立即派人学习了他们改装炉子的办法，又缩小了炉口，根除了风量向外扩散的弊病，产量超过了竞赛对手。现在产量经常保持着三百五十斤左右。一个脖子上包扎绷带、右手架在木板上的人，高声指挥着一群人运料、下料。原来他就是负伤不下火线的郝金忠。共青团员郝金忠，是刚从农村来的杂工。他和炊事员一起建了一座炒钢炉。挍铁、打铁各种活，他都抢着干。一次，他从炉子里拿出熔化得变了形的铁钎放在水里冷却，再去挖钢碴的时候，冷水带进了炉子，炉内炸出钢花，烫伤了他的脸部和右臂。工友们把他架到医院医疗，并让他休养。不料，第二天清早他又回到炉前来了。
    新建炼钢炉工地为了鼓风、照明，急需接通高压输电线。可是，这个厂没有特殊的绝缘设备，接高压线必须全厂停电才能进行。共产党员、老电工张根庆在想：接这条高压线至少得停电二十分钟。这时间可不短啊！怎能让全厂的炼钢、炼铁炉停下来接电线呢？张根庆当即穿了一双普通的绝缘鞋，带了胶皮手套攀上架设高压线的电线杆上。有人劝阻他的这种行动。他总觉不接通这条线路好像没有尽到自己的责任。
    他婉言恳挚地谢绝了人们的劝阻，终于安全地接上了电线。在任务紧迫的时候，他常常日夜不离工地，甚至连休息也不愿离开电线杆。他随带着一张破席子，困乏得支持不住了，便躺在破席上休息一阵再干。不久以前，车间党支部书记看到他的两眼红肿了，命令他回家休息。他晚上十二点回家，第二天一早又来到工地来了。他对别人说：“像这样群众性的炼钢热潮，有几个夜晚不睡觉算不了什么；现在‘苦’些，还不是为了将来‘甜’些。”
    工地的西边，在冒着熊熊炉火的炼钢炉旁，有两面旗帜在一个席棚的上空，迎风招展：一面是红十字旗，一面是写着“钢铁尖兵”的白色字、桃红色底的奖旗。这面奖旗的来历，引起了我们的兴趣。头戴白帽、正在席棚里整理外伤急救包的女同志告诉我们：这面奖旗是工地指挥部赠给她们的。她（他）们从建设炼钢炉的第一天起，就来到这里，担负起一边炼钢、一边急救治疗的双重任务。开始，她（他）们费了很大的力气，一点钢也炼不出来。困难并没有把她们吓倒，相反她们的意志更加坚强了。她（他）们提出了豪迈的口号相互鼓励：“工地好比上甘岭，我们好像志愿军，为了钢帅早升帐，宁死战场也甘心。”有一天晚上，工人子弟学校校长刘春贵，突然被喷射出的钢水烧伤了头部，头发、眉毛也被烫了。这时，正在炼钢的外科医生、共产党员刘效曾，放下手里拿的钢钎，护送刘春贵到医院，亲自给上药、包扎、打针，安置休息以后，他又赶忙返回工地炼钢。女护士张萍、武珍云和挂号员曹运，在男同志帮助下，还建成了一座“三八”小土平炉，一天炼出七百公斤钢。现在，医务人员的炼钢炉，已经由最初的两个增至六个。（附图片）
