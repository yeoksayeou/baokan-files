Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, November 15th: The "Al Shaab" newspaper here today revealed that the United States is conducting bacteriological warfare experiments in Turkey.

The newspaper published a report from its Beirut correspondent stating that an American soldier at the Adana US military base in Turkey, after arriving in Beirut on the 14th, said that the US military authorities were "doing things wrong" in their bacteriological warfare experiments in Adana, causing infectious diseases to break out in the Meersin area near Adana.

He said that the US military authorities fear that the Turkish people will learn the cause of these infectious disease outbreaks and are trying to prevent news of the US engaging in bacteriological warfare from leaking out.

    美在土耳其试验细菌战
    新华社大马士革15日电　此间“群众报”今天揭露美国正在土耳其进行细菌战试验。
    这家报纸刊登它的驻贝鲁特特派记者的一篇报道说，一个美国军人14日在土耳其的亚达那美国军事基地来到贝鲁特之后说，美国军事当局在亚达那进行细菌战试验工作中“做法有毛病”，因此使亚达那附近的美尔星地方发生传染病。
    他说，美国军事当局害怕土耳其人民得知这些传染病流行的原因，正在竭力防止美国搞细菌战的消息走漏。
