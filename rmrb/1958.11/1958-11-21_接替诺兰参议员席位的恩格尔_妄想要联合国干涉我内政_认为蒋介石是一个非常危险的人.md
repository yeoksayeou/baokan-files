Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 19th: Clare Engel, a Democrat who will replace Nolan as a Senator from California, said on the 18th that he hated Chiang Kai-shek.

At a press conference, he said that Chiang Kai-shek "is a very dangerous person," and that he "would implicate our country (the United States) and the whole world in a third world war simply to try to return to the mainland."

Engel complained that those in charge of the US government should have prevented Chiang Kai-shek from stationing large numbers of troops on the coastal islands. However, Engel advocated interference in China's internal affairs through the United Nations. He said he would ask the United States to seek a solution to the "Quemoy and Matsu dispute" in the United Nations. He hoped that the United Nations would appoint an "Asian Committee" to "discuss ways to get out of a very bad situation (for the United States)."

    接替诺兰参议员席位的恩格尔
    妄想要联合国干涉我内政
    认为蒋介石是一个非常危险的人
    新华社19日讯　华盛顿消息：即将接替诺兰而担任加利福尼亚州参议员的民主党人克莱尔·恩格尔18日表示讨厌蒋介石。
    他在记者招待会上说，蒋介石“是一个非常危险的人”，他“仅仅为了设法回到大陆上去，就会把我国（美国）和全世界牵累到第三次世界大战中去”。
    恩格尔埋怨美国政府负责人说，他们本来应该阻止蒋介石把大批军队驻在沿海岛屿的。但是，恩格尔鼓吹通过联合国来干涉中国内政。他说，他将要求美国谋求在联合国中解决“金门、马祖争端”。他希望联合国指定一个“亚洲人委员会”来“商谈摆脱一种（对美国说来）十分恶劣处境的办法”。
