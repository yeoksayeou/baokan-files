Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, November 17th: Heilongjiang Province has decided to first break through the "soil, water, fertilizer, seed, and tool" five barriers before the spring sowing to ensure a thorough transformation of agricultural production next year. The province has already completed the deep plowing of 75 million mu of cultivated land. Currently, farmers in various regions are once again deeply plowing two, three, and even five chi or more on large-scale high-yield satellite fields and are starting to vigorously develop water conservancy. The province has a total of six million laborers and semi-laborers in rural areas who can be mobilized, and they are currently working hard in the fields.

The Party organizations and the vast number of farmers in Heilongjiang Province have full confidence in the thorough transformation of agriculture throughout the province. They analyze that while agricultural production here has the disadvantage of a lack of labor, it also has more favorable conditions, namely, fertile soil, sufficient water, long sunshine hours, and strong people, horses, and many machines. In terms of soil quality and fertilizer, most of the cultivated land in Heilongjiang Province is fertile black soil, which is even more fertile than soil manure in many parts of the south. Peat rich in humus is everywhere, and the masses will be mobilized to vigorously develop peat fertilizer this winter and next spring. In terms of water conservancy, the province has a network of rivers with a runoff volume of 93.6 billion cubic meters. Such good water conservancy conditions are rare in the country. Large-scale construction of water conservancy projects will reach a climax after the ground freezes and plowing can no longer continue. This winter, projects involving 3 billion cubic meters of earthwork will be completed, with a large number of blasting methods adopted to speed up the process. Next year, water conservancy will be basically realized on most of the cultivated land, ensuring stable yields despite drought or flood. As for the work of cultivating improved varieties, Heilongjiang Province started several years ago and has a good foundation in this area. This year, improved seed bases have been established in various regions. More seeds should be selected this winter and next spring, and good seeds should be selected. Next year, not only will close planting be realized, but also basic improved seeds will be used. This winter and next spring, the province will vigorously carry out tool reform to adapt to the needs of close planting. In agricultural production in Heilongjiang Province, mechanization and semi-mechanization have already reached more than 50%. Before next year's spring plowing and sowing, farmers throughout the province will add 2 million horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery, retrofit a complete set of plowing and sowing tools suitable for close planting, complete ball bearing conversion, and complete the reform of transportation tools, greatly improving labor efficiency. This will greatly help solve the problem of labor shortage.

In this great debate to strive for a thorough transformation of agriculture in Heilongjiang Province, cadres and farmers deeply realized that this year, the water, fertilizer, soil, seed, close planting, pest control, tool, and management of the agricultural "constitution" have not been fully implemented, and production has already increased by 52%. Starting from passing the "five barriers" this winter and next spring, fully and conscientiously implementing the agricultural "constitution," a great transformation of agriculture throughout the province next year is entirely possible.

### 明年农业大翻身　冬春首先过“五关”  黑龙江大攻土水肥种工

    明年农业大翻身　冬春首先过“五关”
    黑龙江大攻土水肥种工
    据新华社哈尔滨17日电　黑龙江省决定在春播前首先闯过“土、水、肥、种、工”五关，保证明年农业生产彻底翻身。全省已经完成七千五百万亩耕地的深翻任务，目前各地农民正在大面积高产卫星田上再一次深翻二尺、三尺以至五尺以上，并且着手大搞水利。全省农村中一切能够上阵的劳动力和半劳动力共有六百万人，目前正在田间苦战。
    黑龙江省党的组织和广大农民对全省农业彻底大翻身有着充分的信心。他们分析这里的农业生产虽然有劳动力缺乏的不利条件，但是也有更有利的条件，就是土肥，水足，日照长，人强马壮机器多。在土质和肥料方面，黑龙江省耕地绝大部分是肥沃的黑土，比南方很多地方的土粪还肥。到处都有充满腐植质的草炭，今冬明春将发动群众大搞草炭肥。在水利方面，全省河流纵横，径流量九百三十六亿公方，这样好的水利条件，在全国也是不多的。大规模兴修水利工程，将在结冻后不能继续翻地的时候形成高潮。今年冬天要完成三十亿土方的工程，将大量采取爆破办法，加快速度。明年将在绝大部分耕地上基本实现水利化，做到旱涝保收。至于培育良种的工作，黑龙江省已经在几年前开始，这方面有较好的基础，今年又在各地建立了良种基地。今冬明春要多选种，选好种，明年不但实现密植，而且做到基本良种化。今冬明春，全省将适应密植需要大搞工具改革。在黑龙江省农业生产上，机械化和半机械化已经达到50％以上。到明年春耕播种前，全省农民将增加二百万马力的排灌机械，改装全套适应密植需要的耕播工具，完成滚珠轴承化，完成运输工具的改革，使劳动效率大大提高。这将大大有助于劳动力缺乏问题的解决。
    黑龙江省在这次争取农业彻底大翻身的大辩论中，干部和农民深深体会到，今年对水、肥、土、种、密、害、工、管农业“宪法”执行得还不全面，就已经增产了52％，从今冬明春过“五关”起，全面认真执行农业“宪法”，明年全省农业大翻身是完全可以做到的。
