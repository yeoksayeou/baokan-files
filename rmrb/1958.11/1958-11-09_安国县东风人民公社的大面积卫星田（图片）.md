    Large-Area Satellite Fields of Dongfeng People's Commune, Anguo County
    Plowed thrice and harrowed four times, smoothed five times over,
    The land is as smooth as a mirror, the ridges like lines;
    A thousand years of land have undergone a great transformation,
    Water dragons roll and irrigate the fields.

    The land has become like a garden,
    Grain is abundant, piled up like mountains;
    Communism will be realized soon,
    A happy life for ten thousand years!

    安国县东风人民公社的大面积卫星田
    耕三耙四平五遍，平地如镜埂似线；千年土地大翻身，水龙滚滚灌田园。
    土地达到园田化，粮食丰产堆成山；共产主义早实现，幸福生活万万年。
