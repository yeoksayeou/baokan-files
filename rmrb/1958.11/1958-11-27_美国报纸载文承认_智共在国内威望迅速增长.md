Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Boston dispatch: An article recently published in the American "Christian Science Monitor" admits that the prestige of the Chilean Communist Party is rapidly growing domestically since it regained legal status in August this year.

The newspaper published a dispatch from its correspondent in Santiago stating that in the trade union elections held after the Chilean Communist Party gained legal status, it "has shown that the strength of the Communist Party is quite strong." The dispatch said that in these elections, "Communists have been elected as trade union leaders in several factories." The Chilean Communist Party has gained "control of trade unions" in important enterprises including the Chilean (American-owned) Electricity Company, as well as Chile's important steel, metallurgy, and coal mining companies.

The dispatch also said that the Chilean Communist Party's organ, "El Siglo," has a wide circulation, so much so that "long-established newspapers are watching their circulation being taken away by it."

    美国报纸载文承认
    智共在国内威望迅速增长
    新华社26日讯　波士顿消息：美国“基督教科学箴言报”不久以前刊载的一篇文章承认，智利共产党自今年8月恢复合法地位以来，它在国内的威望正在迅速增长。
    这家报纸刊载它的记者从圣地亚哥发出的一篇通讯说，在智利共产党取得合法地位后所举行的工会选举中，“已经表明共产党的力量相当强大”。这篇通讯说，在这些选举中，“共产党人已经在好几个工厂中当选为工会领袖”。智利共产党已经取得了包括智利（美商）电力公司以及智利重要的钢铁、冶金及煤矿公司等重要企业的“工会的控制权”。
    这篇通讯还说，智利共产党机关报“世纪报”的销路很广，以致“老牌报纸眼看着销数被它夺走”。
