Hearts Linked Above and Below, Visiting to Ask About Warmth and Hardship
Hubei County Over a Thousand Cadres Deeply Investigate Communes to Solve the People's Livelihood Problems
Aoshan Commune Masses Rest Well and Labor Even Better

Taiyuan Electric News from our newspaper—Hubei County, Shanxi Province, recently organized a large number of leading cadres from the county, townships, and people's communes to conduct in-depth visits to grassroots units of people's communes and commune members' families. This large-scale visiting activity was organized by the Hubei County Party Committee. The County Party Committee also decided to institutionalize and regularize this activity of caring for the masses and visiting commune members. Hubei County's activity was determined based on the spirit of organizing a great leap forward in production and caring for the masses' lives. For the past three months, Hubei County farmers, in the great leap forward in production, organized steel armies to mine and smelt iron, and launched shock autumn harvesting and autumn plowing. They "fought the sun during the day and the moon at night," working day and night, braving the severe cold, wind, and snow, disregarding time, and selflessly laboring without regard to remuneration. In order to promote the peasants' labor enthusiasm, and ensure that all people's communes truly provide good food, take good care of children, and provide good rest, comprehensively care for commune members' lives, produce rhythmically, and prepare for a greater leap forward next year, the County Party Committee required all leading cadres to go deep among the masses, live and labor with the masses, personally feel the suffering of the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, and solve problems immediately upon discovery.

Currently, the visiting delegation, composed of more than 1,700 county-level agency and people's commune leading cadres, led personally by the County Party Committee Secretary and members, has gone deep into various steel construction sites, deep plowing fields, collective canteens, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, and remote mountain villages to conduct widespread visiting activities. In more than ten days, they have visited more than 1,100 collective canteens, 740 kindergartens, and homes for the elderly. The visiting delegation cadres also visited many commune member families door-to-door.

The visiting delegation adopted the method of working while visiting, checking, and solving problems. During the visits, the County Party Committee discovered that after all female labor was put into industrial and agricultural production, winter clothing was generally insufficient; grain processing could not keep up with consumption; and commune member families lacked fuel for the winter. It immediately held a telephone conference for emergency deployment. People's communes throughout the county took advantage of the snowy days to mobilize more than 70,000 women to help each other dismantle, wash, and make winter clothing. More than 390 sewing factories in the county's communes contracted for single men and commune members lacking sewing ability. Within a few days, they rushed to make 1.2 million pieces of clothing, shoes, and socks, so that everyone had cotton clothes, about half of the commune members had small coats, and each person had an average of two pairs of shoes and socks. Winter clothing for protection against the cold was perfectly resolved. Various communes also transferred a portion of the labor force to rush to mill rice and grind flour, and generally prepared three to four months of food. Currently, the county-wide fuel preparation activity is underway, and 80% of commune member families have prepared three to four months of fuel, ensuring the need for heating and warming beds at home. Some places, after the visiting delegation mobilized the masses to adjust existing vacant houses, build simple straw sheds, and let commune members take food home to eat, solved the problem of eating in the winter. The County Party Committee Secretary saw that some collective canteens did not pay attention to vegetable nutrition, so he adjusted the meal schedule with the canteen management personnel and increased the variety of staple and non-staple foods. Commune members happily reflected: "The visiting cadres are really good, they look for problems all the time, they personally handle problems, and they don't leave if they can't solve them."

The visiting of commune members by leaders at all levels, and their concern for commune members' clothing, food, housing, and transportation, has had a great inspirational and educational effect on the broad masses. The task of harvesting the last 60,000 to 70,000 mu of autumn crops in half a month was completed in only five days, achieving clean land and clean threshing floors and completing the task ahead of schedule. (Yang Yi)

According to Xin Hunan Bao News: The Party Committee of Aoshan People's Commune in Xiang County, Hunan, in order to further improve the lives of the masses, adjusted the rhythm of production, and the enthusiasm of the masses has become even higher. The commune first conducted an investigation in the Paishan Team. This team has a total of 110 male and female full and semi-laborers. In addition to those participating in steel production, sideline occupations, and service work, only 26 people regularly engage in agricultural labor. These people also have to support iron smelting and mining sand. At that time, 24 mu of late rice and more than 10 mu of summer sweet potatoes had not been harvested. Through group discussions, everyone unanimously pointed out: as long as we can go to bed earlier, we can guarantee getting up earlier the next day, and we can complete two days' tasks in one day. As a result of the trial, the 24 mu of late rice was completely harvested the next morning, and in the afternoon they participated in picking and digging sand with great energy.

This matter was a great inspiration to the commune cadres, who realized that the great leap forward is not simply about the length of labor time, but mainly about the improvement of work efficiency and the quality of work. Therefore, it was decided to promote this experience in the commune. At the beginning, some team cadres still had some concerns, worrying about affecting the completion of the task. In response to these ideas, the Party Committee organized all commune and team cadres to debate, and improved cadres' understanding from three aspects. First, by summarizing the work, everyone realized the necessity of appropriate rest. For example, when transplanting late rice this year, as a result of continuous day and night assaults, work efficiency became lower and lower, and one person could only transplant a little more than one point of land per day. Later, after resting for two nights, the work efficiency immediately increased significantly, and generally one person transplanted five points of land per day. Second, carry out the education of the mass viewpoint, so that everyone realizes that as a cadre, one must not only care about the masses' production, but also care about the masses' lives. Third, through the cadres' own personal experience, clarify the benefits of good rest for production and work.

After repeated and in-depth debate, ideas were unified, and everyone agreed that: although working hard day and night is a conscious action of the masses, cadres should actively care for the masses and let everyone eat well and sleep well, so that production can definitely be done even better. Therefore, it was decided: to ensure the masses eight hours of sleep; to rest for an hour and a half at noon every day, as the time for the masses' cultural and recreational activities; if night work is started during the busy farming season, to rest one night every three days, to stop work at six o'clock, and not arrange other activities. The iron factory, which used to be a two-shift system, was also changed to a three-shift system. At the same time, strengthen canteen management so that everyone eats well.

The implementation of this measure has been warmly supported by the broad masses. The entire commune has more than 3,000 mu of sweet potatoes. In the past, only more than 1,000 mu were dug in half a month. This time, in just six days, all were harvested. The entire commune rushed to harvest the late rice in three days, and completed more than 700 mu of oilseed rape planting in one day.

    上下心连心　登门问寒暖
    壶关一千多干部深入公社解决群众生活问题
    坳上公社群众休息得好劳动得更好
    本报太原电　山西省壶关县最近组织县、乡、人民公社的大批领导干部到人民公社的基层单位和社员家庭，展开深入的访问活动。这次大规模的访问活动，是由中共壶关县委组织的。县委并且决定要把开展这项关心群众、访问社员的活动制度化、经常化。壶关县这项活动是根据组织生产大跃进和关心群众生活的精神确定的。壶关县农民最近三个月以来，在生产大跃进运动中，组织钢铁大军采矿炼铁，突击秋收、秋耕工作，他们“白天战太阳、晚上战月亮”，夜以继日地不避严寒风雪，不计时间、不讲报酬的忘我劳动着。县委为了发扬农民这种劳动热情，使各个人民公社确实做到吃好、带好孩子、休息好，全面关心社员生活，有节奏地生产，为实现明年更大的跃进作好准备，要求所有领导干部深入到群众中去，和群众一同生活一同劳动，亲身感受群众疾苦，听取群众意见，发现问题立即解决。
    目前，由全县一千七百多个县级机关和人民公社领导干部组成的访问团，在县委书记、委员的亲自率领下，深入到各个钢铁工地、深翻地现场集体食堂、幼儿院、敬老院和偏僻的山庄窝铺普遍展开访问活动。十多天中，已访问了一千一百多个集体食堂、七百四十个幼儿院和敬老院。访问团干部还登门到户访问了许多社员家庭。
    访问团采取边访问、边检查和边解决问题的办法进行工作。在访问中，县委发现在妇女劳力全部投入工、农业生产以后，冬装普遍准备不足；粮食加工赶不上食用；社员家庭过冬燃料缺乏。就马上召开电话会议作了紧急布置。全县人民公社利用下雪天，发动七万多个妇女，互相帮忙拆洗和制作冬装，全县公社的三百九十多个缝纫厂包干了单身汉和缺乏缝纫能力的社员户。几天内就赶制出衣服、鞋袜一百二十万件，人人有了棉衣，半数左右的社员有了小外衣，每个人平均有了两双鞋袜。御寒冬装得到完满解决。各个公社还抽调了一部分劳力突击碾米磨面，普遍准备好三、四个月的食粮。目前全县准备燃料活动正在紧张进行，80％的社员户已备妥三、四个月的燃料，保证了家庭烧炕取暖的需用。有些地方经过访问团发动群众调剂现有空房、搭简易秸秆饭棚和让社员打饭回家吃等，解决了冬天吃饭的问题。县委书记看到有些集体食堂不注意蔬菜营养，就同食堂管理人员调整饭表、增多了主食和副食花样。社员们高兴地反映：“访问干部实在好，时时刻刻把问题找，有了问题亲下手，解决不了就不走。”
    各级领导干部访问社员，关心社员衣食住行，对广大群众鼓舞和教育作用很大。半个月收完最后六、七万亩秋禾的任务，仅在五天内就作到地净场光、提前完成任务。　（杨义）
    据新湖南报消息　湖南郴县坳上人民公社党委会，为进一步改善群众生活，调整了生产节奏，群众积极性更加高涨。该社先在排山中队作了一次考察。这个队共有男女全半劳动力一百一十人，除参加钢铁生产和副业、服务性工作的人外，经常从事农业劳动的仅二十六人，这些人还要支援炼铁挖矿砂。当时有二十四亩晚稻和十多亩夏红薯全部未收回来。通过小组会座谈，大家一致指出：只要能够早些睡觉，第二天保证早些起来，一天可以完成两天的任务。试行的结果，第二天一个上午，就将二十四亩晚稻全部收割完毕，下午又劲头十足地参加挑挖矿砂去了。
    这件事情对公社干部是一个很大的启发，认识到大跃进不单纯看劳动时间的长短，主要的是工效的提高和质量的好坏。因此，决定将这一经验在公社推广。开始时，有的队干部还有一些顾虑，担心影响任务的完成。针对这些思想，党委会组织了全体社队干部进行辩论，从三方面来提高干部的认识，一是通过总结工作，使大家认识到适当休整的必要性。如今年插晚稻时，由于连续日夜突击的结果，工效越来越低，一人一天只插得一分多田。后来休息了两晚，工效立即显著上升，一般一人一天插到了五分田。二是进行群众观点的教育，使大家认识到作为一个干部，不仅要关心群众生产，更要关心群众生活。三是通过干部自己的切身体会，明确休息得好，对生产和工作的好处。
    经过反复深入地辩论，统一了思想，大家一致认为：日夜苦干，虽然是群众自觉的行动，但是干部应该主动地关心群众，让大家吃好睡好，这样就一定可以把生产搞得更好。因此决定：保证群众八小时的睡眠；每天中午休息一个半钟头，作为群众文化娱乐活动的时间；如果农忙突击时开夜工，每三天休息一个晚上，六点钟收工，不安排其他活动。铁厂过去是两班制，也改为三班制。同时，加强食堂管理，使大家吃得好。
    这一措施的实行，受到了广大群众的热烈拥护。全公社有三千多亩红薯，以前半个月时间，只挖了一千来亩，这次仅六天工夫，就全部收完了。全社三天时间突击收完了晚稻，一天完成了七百多亩的种油菜任务。
