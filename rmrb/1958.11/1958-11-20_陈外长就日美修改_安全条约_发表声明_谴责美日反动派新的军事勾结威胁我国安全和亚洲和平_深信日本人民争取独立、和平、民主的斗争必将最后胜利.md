Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Foreign Minister Chen Yi of the People's Republic of China issued the following statement regarding the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty":

            November 19, 1958

    The Kishi Nobusuke government of Japan is currently negotiating with the U.S. government on revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The United States, harboring malicious intentions, is eager to drag Japan into the water, making it a tool for aggression in Asia. The Kishi Nobusuke government of Japan is also willing to rely on the United States, tying Japan more tightly to the U.S. war chariot, in order to realize its policy of continuing to antagonize China and expand into Southeast Asia.

    The Chinese people are suffering from American aggression. The Chinese people also have fresh memories of the aggressive crimes of Japanese militarism. The Chinese government and the Chinese people cannot but express serious concern and great indignation at the conspiracy of the Kishi Nobusuke government of Japan to collude with the United States and antagonize the Chinese people.

    The U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is a one-sided, unequal treaty by which U.S. imperialism enslaves the Japanese nation. This treaty has increasingly brought Japan closer to the brink of war manufactured by the United States. For several years, in order to get rid of American control and strive for national independence, the Japanese people have constantly demanded the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the removal of all U.S. military bases and the withdrawal of all U.S. armed forces from Japanese territory, including Okinawa and Ogasawara. The Chinese people fully sympathize with and support these legitimate aspirations of the Japanese people, and are willing to see these aspirations realized through the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" or the signing of a truly equal U.S.-Japan treaty.

    However, the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" that the United States and Kishi Nobusuke are preparing to make at present completely runs counter to the wishes of the Japanese people. The United States attempts to take advantage of the Japanese people's desire for independence and autonomy, using the tactic of substituting one thing for another, to revise this treaty into an even more unequal treaty for Japan. According to the information that has been revealed, the United States may this time exchange some concessions in form for greater sacrifices from Japan. The U.S. calculation is very clear, namely: first, in the name of common defense, Japan must bear the obligation of defending U.S. military bases; second, the common defense area should be expanded to the Western Pacific; third, in the event of an emergency, Japan will be dragged into a nuclear war to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the United States. In this way, the Americans can permanently use Japan as a military base, rely on Japan and refuse to leave, and ride on the heads of the Japanese people, commanding them to do this and that, so that Japan will forever lose its independent status.

    The Chinese people have never opposed an independent, peaceful, and democratic Japan possessing armed forces for self-defense to protect its independence. However, according to the U.S. plan, Japan's armed forces are not used for self-defense, but to guard bases for the United States and serve as cannon fodder for U.S. aggression. The United States can, in the name of "common defense," send Japanese troops to our country's Taiwan or even any region in the Western Pacific at a time when the United States deems it necessary, to serve as accomplices in U.S. military aggression.

    The U.S. agreement to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" at the present time is by no means accidental. After the United States recently took the field itself in the Middle East, especially in the Taiwan Strait region, and suffered successive defeats, it is urgently looking for a capable helper in the Far East to take the lead for it, in order to realize its conspiracy of using Asians to fight Asians. And it is not surprising that Kishi Nobusuke is willing to go into the water with the United States. The Kishi Nobusuke government, which represents the potential imperialism of Japan, believes that further collusion with the United States can revive Japanese militarism, suppress the dissatisfaction and resistance of the Japanese people, solve Japan's increasingly serious economic crisis, and realize the ambition of Japanese monopoly capital to meddle in Taiwan and expand into Southeast Asia. However, Kishi Nobusuke's calculation is completely wrong. Today's world is by no means the world of twenty years ago. The powerful Soviet Union and China cannot be touched. Japanese monopoly capital's attempt to use further military collusion with the United States to carry out economic, political, and military expansion into Southeast Asia will certainly run into a wall. The awakened people of Southeast Asian countries will never be willing to be the object of Japanese plunder. Japan's expansion can only arouse the resolute opposition of the people of these countries and end in failure, and there can be no other result. If Kishi Nobusuke is obsessed and determined to act as an accomplice to U.S. aggression against China and Asia, the result can only be to lift a rock to drop it on his own feet.

    Japan is a nation with an independent tradition. The Japanese people are hardworking, intelligent, and courageous people. The Japanese people cannot allow the United States to ride on their heads for a long time. They resolutely demand an end to the U.S. occupation of Japan, the abolition of the unequal treaties signed between the United States and Japan, and the maintenance of an equal relationship between the United States and Japan as two independent countries. The Chinese people have always supported the Japanese people's struggle for independence, peace, and democracy, and sincerely hope that Japan will become a peaceful and neutral country. An independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral Japan, establishing equal and mutually beneficial economic relations with all countries in the world, especially Asian countries, developing together, prospering together, and living in peace, is the only bright future for the Japanese people.

    Kishi Nobusuke's policy of leading the Japanese people to a dead end has aroused increasingly strong resistance from all walks of life in Japan. In order to deprive the Japanese people of their democratic freedoms and pave the way for the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the Kishi Nobusuke government is attempting to forcibly pass the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment." In order to oppose this bill, to oppose the new military collusion between the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, and to oppose Kishi Nobusuke's policy of antagonizing China, the Japanese people have launched an unprecedented and mighty mass movement. Knowledgeable people within the Liberal Democratic Party have also expressed increasing dissatisfaction with Kishi Nobusuke's reactionary policies. The Chinese people wholeheartedly sympathize with and support the Japanese people's just struggle for independence and defense of democracy. Although the struggle is long-term and the road is tortuous, the U.S. imperialism and its accomplices will definitely fail in the end, and the Japanese people will definitely win in the end.

    陈外长就日美修改“安全条约”发表声明
    谴责美日反动派新的军事勾结威胁我国安全和亚洲和平  深信日本人民争取独立、和平、民主的斗争必将最后胜利
    新华社19日讯　中华人民共和国外交部长陈毅关于日美修改“安全条约”的声明
            1958年11月19日
    日本岸信介政府正在同美国政府就修改日美“安全条约”进行谈判。美国不怀好意，急于拖日本下水，使日本成为它在亚洲进行侵略的工具。日本岸信介政府也甘愿投靠美国，把日本更紧地绑在美国的战车上，以便实现它继续敌视中国和向东南亚扩张的政策。
    中国人民正在遭受着美国的侵略。中国人民对于日本军国主义的侵略罪行也记忆犹新。对于日本岸信介政府勾结美国、敌视中国人民的阴谋，中国政府和中国人民不能不表示严重的关切和极大的愤慨。
    日美“安全条约”是美帝国主义奴役日本民族的片面的、不平等的条约。这个条约使日本越来越被美国带近它所制造的战争边缘。几年来，日本人民为了摆脱美国的控制和争取民族的独立，曾经不断地要求废除日美“安全条约”，要求从日本的领土上，包括冲绳和小笠原在内，撤销美国的一切军事基地和撤退美国的一切武装力量。中国人民完全同情和支持日本人民的这些正当愿望，并且愿意看到日本人民的这些愿望能够通过废除日美“安全条约”或者签订一个真正平等的日美条约而得到实现。
    但是，目前美国和岸信介准备对日美“安全条约”所作的修改，却完全同日本人民的愿望背道而驰。美国企图利用日本人民要求独立自主的愿望，用偷梁换柱的手法，把这个条约修改成为对日本更不平等的条约。根据已经透露出来的消息，美国这次可能用某些形式上的让步，换取日本对美国做出更大的牺牲。美国的打算是很明显的，那就是：第一步，借共同防御之名，要日本承担保卫美国军事基地的义务；第二步，把共同防御地区扩大到西太平洋；第三步，一旦有事，把日本拖进一场核武器的战争，替美国火中取栗。这样一来，美国人就可以永远把日本作为军事基地，赖在日本不走，并且骑在日本人的头上，指挥日本人做这样，做那样，使日本永远丧失独立的地位。
    中国人民从来不反对独立、和平、民主的日本拥有自卫的武装，来保卫自己的独立。但是，按照美国的打算，日本的武装力量并不是用来自卫，而是用来替美国看守基地，充当美国侵略的炮灰。美国可以在“共同防御”的名义下，在美国认为需要的时候，把日本军队派到我国的台湾以至西太平洋的任何地区，充当美国军事侵略的帮凶。
    美国在目前的时机同意修改日美“安全条约”，这绝不是偶然的。美国最近在中近东特别是在台湾海峡地区亲自上阵，连续遭到失败以后，正急于在远东物色一个得力的帮手，来替他顶头阵，以便实现它利用亚洲人打亚洲人的阴谋。而岸信介甘愿跟美国下水，也是毫不奇怪的。集中代表日本潜在的帝国主义的岸信介政府，自以为进一步同美国勾结，就可以复活日本军国主义，镇压日本人民的不满和反抗，解救日本日益严重的经济危机，实现日本垄断资本染指台湾和向东南亚扩张的野心。但是，岸信介的算盘是完全打错了。今天的世界绝不是二十年前的世界。强大的苏联和中国是碰不动的。日本垄断资本想利用同美国的进一步军事勾结，向东南亚进行经济的、政治的和军事的扩张，也肯定是要碰壁的。觉醒了的东南亚各国人民决不甘心做日本掠夺的对象。日本的扩张只能激起这些国家的人民的坚决反对而以失败告终，不可能有任何其他结果。岸信介如果执迷不悟，决心充当美国侵略中国和亚洲的帮凶，其结果只能是搬起石头打自己的脚。
    日本是一个具有独立传统的民族。日本人民是勤劳的、智慧的、勇敢的人民。日本人民不可能容许美国长期骑在自己的头上。他们坚决要求结束美国对日本的占领状态，要求废除美国和日本签订的不平等条约，要求日美之间保持两个独立国家之间的平等关系。中国人民一向支持日本人民争取独立、和平、民主的斗争，并且衷心地期望日本成为一个和平中立的国家。一个独立的、民主的、和平中立的日本，同世界各国首先是亚洲各国建立平等互利的经济关系，共同发展，共同繁荣，和平相处，这是日本人民唯一光明的前途。
    岸信介把日本人民带上绝路的政策，已经引起日本各阶层人民越来越强烈的反抗。岸信介政府为了剥夺日本人民的民主自由，替修改日美“安全条约”铺平道路，正在企图强行通过“警察官职务执行法修正案”。为了反对这个法案，为了反对美日反动派的新的军事勾结，为了反对岸信介敌视中国的政策，日本人民已经掀起了一个规模空前、声势浩大的群众运动。自由民主党内的有识之士也对岸信介的反动政策表示越来越大的不满。中国人民衷心地同情和支持日本人民争取独立和保卫民主的正义斗争。尽管斗争是长期的，道路是崎岖的，但是最后失败的一定是美帝国主义和它的帮凶，最后胜利的一定是日本人民。
