    Thoughts Inspired by the Tremendous Changes in My Hometown
    My hometown is in Pingshan, Hebei, a famous Taihang guerrilla area during the Anti-Japanese War and also the place where the Party Central Committee resided during the Liberation War. I joined the army in 1954, and recently, after reading a letter from home, I am truly amazed by the enormous changes in my mountain village. The Hutuo River Reservoir and power station have been built. In the past, double-wheeled horse carts could not reach Pingshan County, but now railways and highways have been built. The masses are carrying forward the glorious revolutionary traditions of the old base area, summoning soaring enthusiasm, and creating a happy new life under the leadership of the Party. Therefore, I hope you can report on the brand-new face of the old revolutionary base areas. I also hope that the newspaper will open a special column to systematically introduce the heroic posture of rapid advancement in certain counties across the country.

    从故乡的巨大变化想起的
    我的故乡在河北平山，是抗日战争时期有名的太行游击区，也是解放战争时期党中央住过的地方。我1954年参军出来，最近读到家中来信，真是山乡巨变。修起了滹沱河水库、电站。过去双轮马车到不了平山县城，现在修建了铁路、公路。群众发扬老根据地光荣革命传统，鼓起冲天干劲，在党的领导下创造幸福的新生活。因而，我希望你们能够报道老根据地的全新面貌。并且希望报纸辟一个专栏，有计划地介绍全国某些县份飞跃前进的雄姿。
