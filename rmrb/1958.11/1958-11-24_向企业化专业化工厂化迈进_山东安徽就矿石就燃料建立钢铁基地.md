    Moving Towards Enterprise-Oriented, Specialized, and Factory-Based Production
    Shandong and Anhui Establish Steel Bases Based on Ore and Fuel

    (Our report) Shandong Province is accelerating the construction of key steel bases to ensure a greater leap forward in the steel industry.

    In the mass campaign of the whole Party and the whole people to produce steel, various parts of Shandong have vigorously developed "small-scale native groups." As of mid-November, the province already had more than 60,000 small blast furnaces, Shaoyang furnaces, etc., and more than 600 converters and electric furnaces; in addition, there were more than 500,000 crucibles and large kilns. These groups of iron and steel smelting furnaces, scattered throughout the province, have played a significant role in the short-term intensive steel production. However, there were also shortcomings such as being too dispersed and some furnace groups being too far from ore and coal producing areas.

    In order to accelerate the development of the steel industry, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to accelerate the construction of six steel bases in Jinan, Laiwu, Yixian, Linyi, Zibo, and Weifang, based on the principle of proximity to ore and coal and reasonable industrial layout. It has been preliminarily determined that four larger steel plants and six medium-sized steel plants will be gradually built in these six bases, with many small steel plants distributed around the large and medium-sized plants. After the completion of only the four large plants, they will be able to produce 5.5 million tons of pig iron, 3.9 million tons of steel, and 3.15 million tons of steel products annually, according to their designed capacity.

    These steel bases are all being built in areas extremely rich in iron ore, coal, limestone, and various refractory materials, and have relatively convenient transportation. While developing the steel industry, these bases can also achieve comprehensive utilization of mineral products and drive the comprehensive development of coal mining, cement, refractory materials, machinery, oil refining and other industries.

    At present, on the basis of the native furnace groups, the six steel bases are intensifying production, consolidating, rectifying and improving, so that they gradually become iron and steel joint enterprises, and further develop towards enterprise-oriented, specialized, and factory-based production. In order to strengthen the leadership of the bases, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has transferred a large number of leading cadres to enrich the bases. The Zibo base has concentrated the original 25 furnace groups into 25 steel plants, building more than 500 large and small iron smelting furnaces. Now, the factory directors and party secretaries of all 25 factories have been appointed, and simple work rooms and heating rooms have been mostly built. The Weifang base has also established a steel company with four branch factories, and has also established three ore bases in Yidu Hutou Mountain, Pingdu Yubu, and Changyi Zuoshan.

    The construction of these steel bases also adopts the method of communist large-scale collaboration. Those who have people contribute people, and those who have machines contribute machines. The machinery manufacturing industry in Laiwu, Zhangqiu, Linyi and other bases is very weak, so Jinan and Qingdao moved their machinery factories there to provide machine manufacturing and repair services for the local steel plants. The Yixian Steel Base is contracted for construction by Shanghai. The first batch of personnel from Shanghai arrived at the base at the beginning of this month to carry out their work.

    While concentrating its efforts on building six steel bases, Shandong Province will also build a number of medium-sized and small steel plants in Qingdao, Yantai, Jining, Liaocheng and other places, so that large, medium-sized and small steel plants are distributed like stars in the sky, and both foreign and native furnaces bloom everywhere, forming a large, medium, and small steel base network combining native and foreign methods throughout the province.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 23rd — Many small blast furnace groups combining native and foreign methods, with small blast furnaces as the backbone, are gradually forming many steel bases in Anhui Province.

    From the beginning of the mass steel production campaign, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China adopted the principle of combining native and foreign methods, with small blast furnaces as the backbone, and emphasizing both quantity and quality in furnace construction. On the one hand, in order to rapidly increase iron production, it advocated starting with native methods and establishing tens of thousands of small blast furnaces; on the other hand, it used great effort to build small blast furnaces with a volume of 8 cubic meters or more. After several months of efforts by the people of the province, more than 1,100 small blast furnaces with a volume of 8 cubic meters or more have now been built and put into production or are under construction. Because the party committees at all levels have paid close attention to this batch of small blast furnaces and started early, it is estimated that all of them can be completed and put into production by early December.

    At the beginning of the mass steel production campaign, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also particularly emphasized the issue of rational layout, and proposed the "four proximities" principle for furnace construction. These are: proximity to fuel, proximity to ore, proximity to transportation, and proximity to power. Furnaces should only be built in large numbers if at least two of the "four proximities" conditions are met. According to this principle, in the past few months, from Bengbu on the banks of the Huai River in the north to Yuxikou on the banks of the Yangtze River in the south, along the 400-mile-long Huainan Railway, and on both sides of the Yangtze River from Anqing in the west to Ma'anshan in the east, many towns have seen dense clusters of small blast furnaces, and have gradually formed bases. For example, Ma'anshan, Huaian, Huainan, Hefei, Wuhu, Tongling, Bengbu, and Anqing are all larger steel bases formed on these two water and land transportation lines. These steel bases have the convenience of water and land transportation, a coal supply from the Huainan Coal Mine and small kilns in southern Anhui, an ore supply from Ma'anshan and Fanchang, and a sufficient power supply. In addition to these bases, the Provincial Party Committee also mobilized hundreds of thousands of people to go to the mountains to carry out native iron smelting, based on the centuries of experience of native iron smelting and the abundant iron sand conditions in the Dabie Mountains. The quality of the iron smelted also meets the standards stipulated by the state.

    The person in charge of the Provincial Metallurgical Command said: The Provincial Party Committee's policy of building small blast furnace groups and the four-proximities principle of rational layout proposed several months ago are of great significance to the great development of steel production in the province in the future. He said that the main benefits of doing so can be summarized into the following four points: First, the equipment for native blast furnaces can be manufactured in the province, and various furnace building materials can basically be solved in the province, so furnace construction is fast; second, small blast furnaces have higher output, better quality, and more stable production than small native furnaces; third, they can use local materials and fully utilize local resources, reducing long-distance transportation and saving a large amount of labor; fourth, because the layout of the small blast furnace groups meets the "four proximities" conditions, it also prepares conditions for future development into iron and steel joint enterprises.

    向企业化专业化工厂化迈进
    山东安徽就矿石就燃料建立钢铁基地
    本报讯　山东省正在加速重点钢铁基地的建设，以确保钢铁工业更大的跃进。
    在全党全民大办钢铁的运动中，山东各地大搞“小土群”。到11月中旬为止，全省已经拥有小高炉、邵阳炉等六万多座，转炉和电炉六百多座；此外，还有五十多万个坩埚和大窑炉等。这些遍布各地的炼铁炼钢炉群，在短期突击炼钢铁当中曾经起了很大作用。但也存在着过于分散和有些炉群距矿石、煤炭产地太远等缺点。
    中共山东省委为了加速发展钢铁工业，根据就矿就煤的原则和合理的工业布局，决定加速建设济南、莱芜、峄县、临沂、淄博、潍坊六个钢铁基地，初步确定，在这六个基地内逐步建设较大的钢铁厂四个，中型钢铁厂六个，另有很多小型钢铁厂分布在大、中型厂子的周围。仅四个大型厂建成以后，按照设计能力每年就能生产生铁五百五十万吨，钢三百九十万吨，钢材三百一十五万吨。
    这些钢铁基地都建设在铁矿石、煤炭、石灰石和各种耐火材料极为丰富的地区，而且交通比较便利。这些基地在发展钢铁工业的同时，还能做到矿产品综合利用和带动煤矿、水泥、耐火材料、机械、炼油等工业的全面发展。
    现在，六个钢铁基地在土炉群的基础上，一面加紧生产，一面整顿、巩固、提高，使它们逐步成为钢铁联合企业，进一步向企业化、专业化、工厂化发展。为了加强基地的领导，中共山东省委抽调了大批领导干部充实到各基地去。淄博基地已将原来的二十五个炉群集中建成二十五个钢铁厂，共建大小炼铁炉五百多座。现在二十五个厂的厂长，党委书记都已配齐，厂内简易的工作房和暖风房等已大部建起。潍坊基地还成立了钢铁公司，下设四个分厂，同时建立了益都虎头山、平度于埠、昌邑岞山三个矿石基地。
    这些钢铁基地的建设，还采取了共产主义大协作的办法。有人的出人，有机器的出机器。莱芜、章丘、临沂等基地机械制造工业很薄弱，济南、青岛两市就把机械厂迁去，为当地钢铁厂的机器制造和修理服务。峄县钢铁基地由上海包干建设。从上海来的第一批人员，已经在本月初到达基地进行工作。
    山东省在集中力量建设六个钢铁基地的同时，还要在青岛、烟台、济宁、聊城等地建设一批中型和小型钢铁厂，使大、中、小型钢铁厂星罗棋布，洋炉、土炉遍地开花，在全省范围内建成一个大、中、小和土、洋相结合的钢铁基地网。
    新华社合肥23日电　安徽省许多土洋结合、以小高炉为骨干的高炉群，正在逐渐形成为许多钢铁基地。
    中共安徽省委从全民大办钢铁开始，在建炉上便采取了土洋结合、以小高炉为骨干和质量并重的方针。一方面为了迅速提高铁的产量，提倡土法上马，建立起几万个小高炉；另一方面用很大力量抓紧兴建八立方公尺以上的小高炉。经过全省人民几个月的努力，现在建成投入生产和正在兴建的八立方公尺以上的小高炉已经有一千一百多个。这批小高炉，由于各级党委抓得紧，动手早，到12月上旬估计就可以全部建成投入生产。
    中共安徽省委在全民大办钢铁开始的时候，还特别强调了合理布局的问题，提出了建炉的“四就”原则。这就是：就燃料、就矿石、就交通、就动力。在“四就”中至少具有两就条件的，才大批建炉。根据这一原则，几个月来，北从淮河边的蚌埠开始，南到长江岸的裕溪口，长达四百多里的淮南铁路沿线，和西起安庆东到马鞍山的长江两岸，许多城镇都出现了密集的小高炉群，并且逐步形成为基地。如马鞍山、淮安、淮南、合肥、芜湖、铜陵、蚌埠和安庆，就都是在这两条水陆交通线上形成较大的钢铁基地。这些钢铁基地，具有水陆交通的方便条件，有淮南煤矿和皖南小窑煤的煤炭供应，有马鞍山和繁昌等地的矿石供应，还有充足的电源。除了这些基地以外，省委还根据大别山区有几百年土法炼铁经验和丰富的铁砂条件，动员了成百万人上山进行土法炼铁，炼出铁的质量也都合乎国家规定的标准。
    省冶金指挥部的负责人说：省委早在几个月以前提出的大建小高炉群的方针和合理布局的四就原则，对今后全省钢铁生产的大发展具有重大意义。他说，这样做的主要好处可以归纳成以下四点：一、土高炉的设备本省可以制造，各种建炉材料本省可以基本解决，因此建炉快；二、小高炉比小土炉的产量高，质量好，生产稳定；三、能就地取材，充分利用当地资源，减少长途运输，可以节省大批劳动力；四、因为小高炉群的布局符合“四就”条件，所以它也就为今后向钢铁联合企业发展准备条件。
