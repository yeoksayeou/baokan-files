    Flourishing Sino-North Korean Economic Cooperation
    —Written in Celebration of the Fifth Anniversary of the Signing of the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement
    Ming Ke
    The Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed by the governments of China and North Korea on November 23, 1953, has reached its full five years today. The rapid development of economic cooperation between the two countries during this period fully demonstrates the socialist brotherhood between China and North Korea, forged with blood.

    China and North Korea have a long tradition of friendship and close economic ties. Since the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China, the economic relations between the two countries have developed more rapidly and extensively with the increase of friendship between the two peoples. In particular, after the US imperialist war of aggression against Korea was forced to stop under the joint resistance of the Korean and Chinese people, the economic cooperation between the two countries has seen new development. First of all, in terms of trade between the two countries, the trade volume between China and North Korea in 1958 increased tenfold compared with the trade volume between the two countries in 1954. The variety of goods exchanged between the two sides has also gradually expanded. At present, Korea supplies China with various mineral products, non-ferrous metals, steel, chemical raw materials, fertilizers, seafood, medicinal materials, rice seeds, and local specialties. China supplies Korea with coal, grain, cotton, cloth, steel, various machines, vehicles, rubber, paper, and daily necessities. The mutual exchange of these goods plays a positive role in meeting the needs of socialist construction in both countries, promoting the common upsurge of the economy, and continuously improving the material and cultural lives of the people of both countries.

    In order to further strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries and ensure the planned development of trade between the two countries, a long-term trade agreement from 1959 to 1962 was also signed in September this year. The signing of this agreement marks a new stage in the development of trade between China and North Korea.

    In recent years, our two governments and peoples have unswervingly adhered to the principles of mutual assistance, mutual support, and cooperation with each other, and have carried out close cooperation in economic and technical aspects, making many contributions to the common development of socialist and communist construction in the two countries. The RMB 800 million of gratuitous assistance provided by China to Korea in accordance with the provisions of the joint communiqué of the two governments on November 23, 1953, was successfully completed in 1957. Not long ago, during the visit of the Korean government delegation headed by Vice Premier of the Cabinet of Korea, Li Zhouyuan, to China, they held talks with the Chinese government on the issue of future economic cooperation between China and North Korea, and based on the results of the talks, the two governments signed an agreement on China providing two loans to the Korean government. One loan was provided by China to Korea for the investment costs shared by the Korean side in the joint Sino-Korean investment in the Yunfeng Hydropower Station; the other was for Korea to purchase machinery and equipment needed for a textile factory and two cement paper bag factories from China. At the same time, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade also signed a protocol with the Korean Ministry of Domestic and Foreign Trade on China's supply of machinery and equipment to Korea. According to the provisions of this protocol, China will supply Korea with projects such as bearing ball factories, silk textile factories, flour mills, and sugar refineries. The signing of these documents greatly strengthened the economic cooperation between the two countries. The Chinese people have always believed that helping the fraternal Korean people is our lofty internationalist obligation, and it is also helping ourselves.

    In recent years, Sino-North Korean cooperation in scientific and technological cooperation and mutual exchange of production experience has also become increasingly close and frequent. This plays an important role in the socialist construction of the two countries. Since 1953, China has dispatched railway engineering technicians and workers to help Korea repair the damaged railways, and has planned to dispatch technicians in shipbuilding, cement manufacturing, ceramics, daily necessities, and silk weaving to Korea for technical assistance. These personnel have actively completed their tasks and imparted production technology and experience to the Korean brothers without reservation, and at the same time learned a lot of production experience and knowledge from the Korean comrades. In addition, during this period, Korea also dispatched personnel to China in batches to study steelmaking, casting, coal mining, machine manufacturing, railway construction, textile, silk reeling, printing, leather making, wood processing, and canned food manufacturing technologies. In December 1957, the governments of China and North Korea also signed a scientific and technological cooperation agreement. According to the provisions of this document, the two countries exchanged a lot of scientific and technological information. At the same time, the relevant departments of the two countries also dispatched various experts or professional inspection groups to visit each other in order to exchange advanced production experience and scientific research results. In recent years, China has sent experts and delegations to Korea to inspect forestry, agriculture, and the chemical industry. These delegations have learned many things in Korea that are beneficial to China's economic construction.

    In order to effectively utilize the hydropower resources of the Yalu River and meet the growing needs of the two countries for electricity in economic construction, China and North Korea decided in September this year to jointly invest in the construction of the Yunfeng Hydropower Station. According to the agreement of the relevant departments of the two countries, the power station will be completed in 1962. After the completion of this hydropower station, it will bring unlimited light and happiness to the Chinese and Korean people on both sides of the Yalu River.

    In China's economic cooperation with North Korea, there is an incomparably profound spirit of proletarian internationalism, with meticulous and enthusiastic support and assistance being given to each other. In the spring of this year, due to the great leap forward in agricultural production in China, many areas in Jilin, Hebei, and other provinces converted dry land into paddy fields, and there was an urgent need for rice seeds suitable for the northern climate. Under the tight schedule and transportation constraints, the Korean comrades overcame various difficulties and selected more than 4,000 tons of various high-quality rice seeds from many places to supply China. Korea urgently needed to carry out large-scale irrigation of summer crops to increase grain production. Although various water conservancy projects and irrigation machinery and equipment were complete, they could not work due to the lack of a large number of integrated starters. Similarly, under the tight schedule, the employees of Xiangtan Electric Machinery Factory, with the cooperation of many brother factories, worked day and night to rush to produce, and produced an extra 130 units outside the plan to supply Korea. There are many more vivid examples like this in our two countries' economic cooperation.

    The flourishing development of Sino-North Korean economic cooperation in the past five years fully proves that the economic relations between our two countries are based on mutual assistance and mutual support in Marxism-Leninism and a high degree of proletarian internationalism. The development of this cooperation not only brings common prosperity and upsurge to the economies of the two countries, but also strengthens the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. At present, the Chinese people in the Great Leap Forward and the Korean people riding the Chollima are fighting with soaring enthusiasm to accelerate their socialist construction. We firmly believe that with the continuous consolidation and development of the friendship between the two peoples, the development prospects of economic cooperation between the two countries are infinitely bright and splendid.

    中朝经济合作蓬勃发展
    ——为庆祝中朝经济及文化合作协定签订五周年而作
    明克
    中朝两国政府1953年11月23日签订的经济及文化合作协定，到今天已整整五年了。这一时期，两国经济合作事业的飞跃发展，充分表明了中朝两国间用鲜血凝结成的亲如手足的社会主义兄弟关系。
    中朝两国有着悠久的传统的友谊和密切的经济联系，自从朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国成立以后，两国的经济关系，随着两国人民友谊的增进而获得了更加迅速广泛的发展。特别是美帝国主义侵朝战争在朝中人民共同抗击下被迫停止以后，两国的经济合作又有了新的发展。首先，就两国的贸易来说，1958年中朝两国的贸易额，即比1954年两国的贸易额增长了十倍。双方相互交换货物的品种也逐渐扩大。目前朝鲜供应我国的货物有各种矿产品、有色金属、钢材、化工原料、肥料、海产品、药材、稻种和土特产等。而我国供应朝鲜的有煤炭、粮食、棉花、布匹、钢材、各种机器、车辆、橡胶、纸张、日用百货等。通过这些货物的相互交换，对满足两国社会主义建设的需要和促进经济的共同高涨及不断地改善两国人民的物质和文化生活都起着积极的作用。
    中朝两国为进一步加强两国的经济合作，保证两国贸易有计划地发展，在今年9月还签订了1959年到1962年的长期贸易协定。这个协定的签订，标志着中朝两国贸易的发展进入了一个新的阶段。
    几年来，我们两国政府和人民坚持不渝地遵循着相互帮助，相互支持，彼此合作的原则，进行经济、技术各方面的密切合作，为两国社会主义和共产主义建设事业的共同发展，作出了不少的贡献。我国根据1953年11月23日两国政府谈判公报的规定向朝鲜所提供的人民币八亿元的无偿援助，已于1957年顺利执行完毕。在不久以前，以朝鲜内阁副首相李周渊为首的朝鲜政府代表团访问我国期间，曾同我国政府就今后中朝两国经济合作的问题进行了商谈，并根据商谈的结果，两国政府签订了我国向朝鲜政府提供两项贷款的协定。一项由我国贷款给朝鲜，用作中朝两国共同投资建设的云峰水力发电厂朝鲜方面所分担的投资费用；另一项则是供朝鲜用以从我国购买一个纺织厂和两个水泥纸袋厂所需的机器设备。与此同时，中国对外贸易部还同朝鲜对内外商业省签订了关于中国供应朝鲜机器设备的议定书，根据这个议定书的规定，中国将供应朝鲜轴承滚珠厂、绢纺织厂、面粉厂和制糖厂等项目。这些文件的签订，大大地加强了两国的经济合作。我国人民一直认为，帮助兄弟朝鲜人民是我们崇高的国际主义义务，也是帮助了我们自己。
    中朝两国在科学技术合作和生产经验的相互交流方面，近年来也日益密切和频繁。这对两国的社会主义建设起着重要的作用。从1953年以后，我国曾派遣了铁路工程技术人员和工人帮助朝鲜抢修被破坏的铁路，并有计划地派遣了造船、制造水泥、陶瓷、日用品及织绸等技术人员，前往朝鲜进行技术援助。这些人员都积极地完成了任务，并把生产技术和经验无保留地传授给朝鲜兄弟，同时也从朝鲜同志那里学到许多生产经验和知识。另外，在此期间朝鲜还分批派遣人员到中国来，学习炼钢、铸造、采煤、机器制造、修筑铁路、纺织、缫丝、印刷、制革、木材加工、制造罐头等技术。1957年12月中朝两国政府还签订了科学技术合作协定，根据这个文件的规定，两国相互交换了许多科学技术资料。同时，两国的有关部门为了相互交流先进的生产经验和科学的研究成果，还相互派遣了各种专家或专业性的考察团进行参观访问。几年来，我国派往朝鲜的有考察林业、农业、化学工业的专家及代表团，这些代表团在朝鲜学习了许多对我国经济建设有益的东西。
    中朝两国政府为了有效地利用鸭绿江的水力资源，满足两国在经济建设中对电力的日益增长的需要，今年9月决定共同投资兴建云峰水力发电厂，根据两国有关部门的协议，该电站将在1962年建成。这个水电厂建成后，将为鸭绿江两岸的中朝人民带来无限的光明和幸福。
    在我国同朝鲜的经济合作中，渗透着无比深刻的无产阶级国际主义精神，相互进行着无微不至的热情的支持和帮助。今年春天，由于我国农业生产的大跃进，我吉林、河北等省的许多地区的旱地改为水田，急需适宜于北方气候的稻种。在时间紧迫、运输又紧张的情况下，朝鲜同志克服了种种困难，从许多地方挑选出各种优良稻种四千多吨供应我国。朝鲜为增产粮食急需对夏季作物进行大规模的灌溉，各项水利工程及灌溉用的机器设备虽都已齐全，但由于缺少大批的综合启动器而不能进行工作，同样在时间紧迫的情况下，我湘潭电机厂职工，在很多兄弟厂的协作下，昼夜赶制，在计划外还多生产了一百三十台，供应了朝鲜。在我们两国的经济合作中，像这样生动的事例还有很多。
    五年来中朝经济合作的蓬勃发展，充分证明了我们两国间的经济关系是建立在马列主义和高度的无产阶级国际主义的互相帮助、互相支持的基础之上的。这种合作的发展不仅给两国的经济带来共同的繁荣和高涨，而且增强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量。目前大跃进的中国人民和跨上千里马的朝鲜人民正以冲天的干劲为加速其社会主义建设而奋斗，我们深信：随着两国人民友谊的不断巩固和发展，两国经济合作的发展远景是无限光辉灿烂的。
