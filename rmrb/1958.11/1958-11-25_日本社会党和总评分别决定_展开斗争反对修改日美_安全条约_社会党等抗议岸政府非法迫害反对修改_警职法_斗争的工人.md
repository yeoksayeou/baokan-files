Xinhua News Agency, November 24th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese Socialist Party, at its chairman and bureau chief meeting held in Tokyo today, decided to focus its future struggle on opposing the Kishida Nobusuke government's revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," overthrowing the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet, and demanding the dissolution of the Diet.

The Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party made the same decision at its meeting today. The Socialist Party's metropolitan, Hokkaido, prefectural, and county federations will hold activist meetings from December 1st to 9th to discuss specific struggle guidelines.

The Secretary-General of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, Masajiro Kawashima, revealed again at a press conference held in Tokyo today the Kishida Nobusuke group's conspiracy to submit the bill to revise the "Police Duties Execution Law" to the Diet as it is or in a disguised form. He said that the policy of submitting the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" once again has not changed. He said that whether it will be submitted as a separate bill, how it will be revised, and the timing of its submission will be studied in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, November 24th, Tokyo Dispatch: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan held an emergency meeting of its executive committee in Tokyo today and decided to launch a sixth joint struggle centered on the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" around December 10th.

The meeting also discussed how to conduct the fifth joint struggle against the Kishida Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," which was originally scheduled for November 26th, and decided that on that day after 3:00 p.m., local trade union councils and regional trade unions should hold 30-minute workplace rallies during working hours. The goal of the struggle is to demand that the relevant departments of the Kishida Nobusuke government withdraw the decisions to illegally arrest and punish workers, etc.

Xinhua News Agency, November 24th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Central Executive Committee of the Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement today protesting against the Kishida Nobusuke government's illegal persecution of workers participating in the joint struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" (referred to as the "Police Duties Law") and demanding that the Kishida Nobusuke government immediately stop this illegal suppression and release the arrested.

The National Conference Against the Bad Revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" also issued a statement today, demanding that the Kishida Nobusuke government rescind the unreasonable punishments against personnel participating in the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Law." At today's representative meeting, the National Conference also decided to pay close attention to the Kishida Nobusuke government's conspiracy to resubmit the bill to revise the "Police Duties Law" to the Diet's ordinary session, and decided to launch a struggle to demand the dissolution of the Diet and oppose the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The All-Japan Federation of Agricultural and Forestry Ministry Employees' Unions held a workplace rally in front of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Tokyo this afternoon for about an hour, protesting against the Kishida Nobusuke government's arrest of sixteen leading cadres of the union. Approximately three hundred people participated in the rally. The rally issued a statement pointing out that Kishida Nobusuke's arrest was an illegal suppression of the union. The rally also decided to send a protest group to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the National Police Agency, and the Metropolitan Police Department to protest and demand the immediate release of the arrested.

The Kishida Nobusuke government, disregarding the strong protests from all sectors of Japan, continues to persecute trade union cadres participating in the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Law."

The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department arrested Fujiwara Akira, chairman of the Tokyo Local Headquarters Executive Committee of the National Railway Workers' Union, and Kurata, a member of the Executive Committee of the Akabane Branch of the union, this morning.

The Oita Railway Administration announced today that it would give 383 union members who participated in the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Law" on the 5th reductions in pay or warnings. The union has decided to return all punishment notices and decided to hold protest rallies at various workplaces from noon tomorrow.

The Kumamoto Post Office also announced today that it would give 577 union members who participated in the workplace rally against the revision of the "Police Duties Law" on the 5th reductions in pay, warnings, and severe warnings. The Kyushu Regional Headquarters of the All-Japan Communications Workers' Union has instructed local union organizations in Kumamoto to immediately return the punishment notices. (Attached picture)
November 9th, representatives of the residents of Yamaguchi and Hiroshima prefectures and more than 3,000 citizens of Iwakuni held a rally and demonstration in Iwakuni City, demanding that the U.S. military immediately withdraw aircraft carrying nuclear weapons from Iwakuni Base.
