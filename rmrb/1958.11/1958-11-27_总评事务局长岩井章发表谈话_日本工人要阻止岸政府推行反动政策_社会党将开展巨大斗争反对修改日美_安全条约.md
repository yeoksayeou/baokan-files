Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 26th: Akira Iwai, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), stated regarding the fifth joint struggle held by Japanese workers today that we must strengthen the people's power, which has already forced the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" into unfinished deliberation, and further develop it into a force to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in order to prevent the Kishi Nobusuke government from implementing its series of reactionary policies. This is the central task of the Japanese workers' struggle in the future.

Iwai continued: In addition, in the joint struggle, we must also oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's re-introduction of a disguised "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill"; demand that the Kishi Nobusuke government authorities withdraw the decision to arrest and punish workers participating in the struggle; demand the dissolution of the Diet; oppose the implementation of the "Performance Evaluation" system; demand the promotion of the ratification of International Labor Organization treaties; demand full employment for workers and higher wages.

Iwai pointed out that the struggle to demand that the Kishi Nobusuke government withdraw illegal punishments is not only for rescuing the punished workers, but also plays a very important role in thoroughly preventing the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" and safeguarding workers' rights. Iwai pointed out that the recently successfully concluded struggle of the Oji Paper Manufacturing Company's union has achieved the first victory in the weakest aspect of the Japanese labor movement, the struggle for the protection of rights, which will play a significant role in the development of future struggles for the protection of workers' rights.

When talking about the year-end struggle, Iwai pointed out that the Japan Coal Miners' Union will launch a struggle to prevent layoffs starting from the 27th. Coal miners will be at the forefront of the struggle against capitalist "rationalization" from the end of the year to next spring. The main purpose of their struggle is to open up new paths for the labor movement in the context of the current economic crisis in Japan.

Iwai pointed out that, in short, in the future struggles of the Japanese working class, it is necessary to closely combine the safeguarding of workers' rights and economic struggles with the struggle against the revision and demand for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and to develop this struggle into a national struggle that includes farmers and small and medium-sized enterprises.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 25th: Japan Socialist Party Chairman Mosaburo Suzuki stated in Osaka today that the Socialist Party will launch a struggle movement with even greater momentum than the opposition to the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" to oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's plot to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The Socialist Party has always demanded the abolition of this unequal treaty imposed on the Japanese people.

Suzuki stated that the Socialist Party will pursue the responsibility of the Kishi Nobusuke government for illegally punishing leading cadres of the Japan Teachers' Union during the regular session of the Diet. The Kishi Nobusuke government has taken retaliatory measures against many cadres of the Japan Teachers' Union because of their resolute struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's forced implementation of the "Performance Evaluation" system.

    总评事务局长岩井章发表谈话
    日本工人要阻止岸政府推行反动政策
    社会党将开展巨大斗争反对修改日美“安全条约”
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章就日本工人今天举行的第五次联合斗争发表谈话说，目前我们要加强已经迫使“警察官职务执行法修正案”成为审议未了的法案的人民的力量，使它进一步成长为打倒岸信介内阁和废除日美“安全条约”的力量，以阻止岸信介政府推行它的一系列反动政策。这是今后日本工人斗争的中心课题。
    岩井接着说：此外，在联合斗争中我们还要反对岸信介政府再次提出变相的“警职法修正案”；要求岸信介政府有关当局撤回逮捕和处分参加斗争的工人的决定；要求解散国会；反对推行“勤务评定”制度；要求促进批准国际劳工组织条约；要求完全雇用工人和提高工资。
    岩井指出，要求岸信介政府撤回非法处分的斗争，不仅是为了援救被处分的工人，而且在彻底阻止修改“警职法”和维护工人权利的斗争中也占有很重要的地位。岩井指出，最近胜利结束的王子制纸工业公司工会的斗争，在日本工人运动中最弱的维护权利的斗争方面首次取得了胜利，这将对今后的维护工人权利的斗争的发展起很大作用。
    岩井在谈到年终斗争的问题时指出，日本煤矿工会将从27日起展开阻止解雇的斗争，煤矿工人将站在从年底到明年春季展开的反对资方的“合理化”斗争的最前列，他们进行斗争的主要目的是要为在目前日本发生经济危机的情况下开展的工人运动开辟新的道路。
    岩井指出，总之，在日本工人阶级今后开展的斗争中，必须把维护工人权利和经济斗争同反对修改和要求废除日美“安全条约”的斗争紧紧结合起来，并且使这个斗争发展成为包括农民、中小企业者的全民性的斗争。
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎今天在大阪发表谈话说，社会党将要展开比反对岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”的声势更加浩大的斗争运动，来反对岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋。社会党一直要求废除这一强加在日本人民头上的不平等条约。
    铃木表示，社会党将在国会平时会议上追究岸信介政府非法处分日本教职员工会领导干部的责任。日本教职员工会由于进行了反对岸信介政府强制推行“勤务评定”制度的坚决斗争，岸信介政府对这个工会的许多干部进行了报复性的处分。
