    Viewing the Distribution System from a Communist Perspective
    Discussions on Bourgeois Rights in Various Regions
    "More Work, More Pay" is Not Fair
    Shanghai Philosophical and Social Sciences Circles
    The Shanghai Federation of Philosophy and Social Sciences held a symposium on October 26th, launching a heated discussion based on several arguments in Zhang Chunqiao's article "Breaking with Bourgeois Rights Ideology." During the discussion, comrades expressed their views on issues such as the change from the supply system to the wage system, the principle of remuneration according to labor, the manifestations of bourgeois rights and bourgeois rights ideology, and the implementation of the supply system.
    Regarding the issue of changing from the supply system to the wage system, many people believe that Zhang Chunqiao's article did not better point out the historical conditions at the time. Some people believe that if the entire population had implemented the supply system at the beginning of liberation, there would have been neither a material basis nor an ideological basis. At that time, the supply system could be preserved in the army and among cadres, and the scope of implementation gradually expanded. However, some people disagree with this view. They believe that if two distribution systems coexisted at that time, it would inevitably cause much confusion. Therefore, changing to the wage system was an inevitable trend.
    Regarding the issue of remuneration according to labor, many people believe that this distribution system is more equal compared to the distribution system in the old society, but it is still unequal in socialist society. For example, do skilled workers work more than unskilled workers? Do university graduates work more than elementary school graduates? Society makes different arrangements and cultivates them differently. Therefore, if it is believed that they work more and should get more, that is seemingly fair but actually unfair.
    Some people believe that a distinction should be made between the remnants of bourgeois rights and bourgeois rights ideology. Concessions have to be made to the former because they still need to be utilized, but there can be no compromise with the latter.
    The Supply System is Closer to Communism
    People's Liberation Army Daily
    The People's Liberation Army Daily recently launched a heated discussion on "Is the Supply System Better or the Salary System?" A few letters praised the wage system, but most letters opposed this view. Some letters believe that the only standard for a communist revolutionary soldier to distinguish between good and bad is to see which system is more in line with the communist spirit. Without this, there is no way to argue about right and wrong. The reason for saying that the supply system is good is that it is closer to communism, more conducive to breaking with the remnants of bourgeois rights, and more conducive to promoting the transition of society to communism. Some letters said: The reason why some comrades do not welcome the supply system, apart from other reasons, is that they lack the idea of continuous revolution, as if the revolution can stop at socialism, and "it would be nice to live like this"; the essence of this idea is individualism, which runs counter to communist ideology.
    Many comrades pointed out in the discussion that the attitude towards the supply system and the salary system also reflects how a communist treats labor and remuneration. There are two attitudes towards labor and remuneration: one is the attitude of employment, and the other is the communist attitude. Communist labor is unpaid labor, and communists should be unpaid laborers. What revolutionaries should be concerned about first is not personal material interests, but the common prosperity of the entire society. Achieving communism, so that all the people can obtain the greatest and most material benefits, is the greatest and best reward for revolutionaries.
    The Tradition of the Supply System Should Not Be Interrupted
    Anhui Daily
    Anhui Daily reprinted Zhang Chunqiao's "Breaking with Bourgeois Rights Ideology" on October 23rd, and proposed to launch a discussion on this issue in the editor's note. On the 24th, it published Ke Bo's article "Is the Supply System Better or the Wage System?" which raised different views on several arguments in Zhang's article.
    The author believes that the supply system is superior to the wage system. The reasons are: first, it can block people's pursuit of high-level enjoyment; second, it can prevent people from pursuing high salaries and grades; third, it can reduce certain inequalities in people's labor remuneration. However, the author believes that we should not obliterate the positive role that the wage system has played since liberation. Zhang's article made a one-sided error in this regard. At the same time, the author also disagrees with the view that the implementation of the wage system after liberation was "inevitable." He said that what was inevitable was not the wage system, but the principle of remuneration according to labor. At present, because the productive forces are not yet developed enough, we can only adopt the principle of remuneration according to labor. The author believes that at that time we could have inherited the excellent tradition of the supply system, and appropriately adjusted its content according to the new situation, so that the nature of military communism would gradually decrease, the principle of remuneration according to labor could be appropriately reflected, and in particular, the communist elements of distribution according to need could be gradually increased. This would be more conducive to socialist construction.
    The Driving Force is Politics, Not Material
    Shanxi Daily
    Shanxi Daily's theoretical page has launched a discussion on "Is it good to implement the supply system?" since October 14th, and three issues of the discussion have been published. These three issues of discussion focused on the question of whether "material interests" are the driving force to promote people's enthusiasm for production. Li Shan's article was published in the October 14th issue. He believes that although the supply system has its advantages, it also has the side effects of making people unmotivated and not actively working, producing the idea of "doing the same whether you work or not." He said that it is too "leftist" to think that people's consciousness is much higher than in the past, and that there will be no such side effects from implementing the supply system. Therefore, he believes that the time is not yet ripe for the universal implementation of the supply system. In the discussion articles published in the second and third issues, the vast majority of comrades disagreed with Li Shan's opinion. Many comrades used concrete examples to illustrate that the current high enthusiasm for production among the Chinese people is not the result of material stimulation, but of putting politics in command and the result of communist education. Selfless labor for communism has become the mainstream today.
    In the issue of October 29th, a letter from reader Bai Qishan was published. Bai Qishan's thoughts can be summarized in two points: first, he believes that the implementation of the supply system will disadvantage single men, and they will not be able to work hard; second, he wanted to save money to buy a bicycle, but heard that the supply system was going to be implemented, so he didn't buy it, fearing that it would be nationalized. The editorial department hopes that everyone will discuss Bai Qishan's thoughts.

    用共产主义观点看分配制度
    各地讨论资产阶级法权问题
    多劳多得并不公道
    上海哲学社会科学界
    上海哲学社会科学联合会在10月26日召开座谈会，根据张春桥的“破除资产阶级的法权思想”一文中的若干论点，展开了热烈的讨论。发言的同志在讨论中就供给制改为工资制，按劳取酬的原则，资产阶级法权和资产阶级法权思想的表现，以及改行供给制等问题，提出自己的看法。
    关于供给制改为工资制的问题，许多人认为张春桥的文章没有更好地指出当时的历史条件。有些人认为，解放初期如果全民实行供给制，那是既没有物质基础，也没有思想基础的。当时，可以在部队和干部中保存供给制，并且逐渐扩大实行供给制的范围。但是，有些人不同意这个看法。他们认为，当时如果两种分配制度并存，那就必会引起许多紊乱，因此，改工资制是必然趋势。
    关于按劳取酬的问题，许多人认为这个分配制度同旧社会的分配制度比较是平等的，但是，在社会主义社会里，还是不平等的。比如，熟练劳动者比不熟练劳动者是否多劳呢？大学毕业生是否比小学毕业生多劳呢？他们都是社会对他们作了不同的安排和培养，因此，如果认为他们就是多劳，从而应该多得，那就是貌似公道实不公道的。
    有些人认为，要把资产阶级法权残余同资产阶级法权思想加以区别。对前者不得不有所让步，因为还要利用它，但是，对后者不能有丝毫妥协。
    供给制更接近共产主义
    解放军报
    解放军报最近展开了“供给制好还是薪金制好？”的热烈讨论。少数来信在为工资制叫好，但是，多数来信反对这种观点。有的来信认为，做为一个共产主义的革命战士，区别事情好坏的唯一标准，是看哪个制度更符合共产主义精神。离开了这一点，就争论不出什么是非来。说供给制好，是因为它更接近共产主义，更有利于破除资产阶级法权的残余，更有利于推动社会向共产主义过渡。有的来信说：有些同志之所以对供给制不欢迎，除了其它方面的原因以外，还有一个重要原因，就是缺乏不断革命的思想，似乎革命革到社会主义就可以了，“照这样生活下去也就不错了”；这种思想的实质，正是与共产主义思想背道而驰的个人主义。
    讨论中很多同志指出：对供给制和薪金制问题的态度，实质上也反映了一个共产主义者如何对待劳动和报酬的问题。有两种对待劳动和报酬的态度：一种是雇佣的态度，另一种是共产主义的态度，共产主义的劳动是无偿的劳动，共产主义者应当是无偿劳动者。革命者首先关心的不应该是个人的物质利益，而是整个社会的共同富裕。实现共产主义，使全体人民获得最大最多的物质利益，也就是对革命者最大最好的报酬。
    不该中断供给制的传统
    安徽日报
    安徽日报在10月23日转载了张春桥的“破除资产阶级的法权思想”一文，并在按语中提出了开展关于这个问题的讨论。24日刊载了柯柏的“供给制好还是工资制好？”一文，对张文的若干论点提出了不同的看法。
    作者认为供给制是比工资制优越的。其理由是：一，它可以堵塞人们追求高级享受的可能性；二，它可以防止人们追求高额工资等级的想法和做法；三，它能减少人们在劳动报酬上的某些不平等现象。但是，作者认为，我们也不应把解放后工资制所曾起过的积极作用一笔抹煞，张文正是在这方面犯了片面性的错误。同时，作者又不同意那种认为解放后实行工资制是“势在必行”的观点。他说，势在必行的不是工资制，而是按劳取酬制度。目前，由于生产力还不够发展，我们还只能采取按劳取酬的原则。作者认为，当时我们可以把供给制的优良传统继承下来，并根据新的情况适当调整一下它的内容，使军事共产主义的性质逐渐减少，按劳取酬的原则能够恰如其分地得到体现，特别是要使各取所需的共产主义因素逐渐增加。这会更有利于社会主义建设。
    动力是政治不是物质
    山西日报
    山西日报学理论专页从10月14日起，开展了“实行供给制好不好？”的讨论，讨论已发表了三期。这三期的讨论集中在“物质利益”是不是推动人们生产积极性的动力的问题。10月14日这一期上发表了李山的文章。他认为供给制虽然有它的优越性，但是它也有使人不求上进、不积极劳动的副作用，产生“干不干二斤半”的思想。他说，认为现在人们的觉悟比过去大大提高了，实行供给制不会有那些副作用，这是过“左”的。因此，他认为普遍实行供给制还不到时候。第二、三期发表的讨论文章中，绝大多数同志不同意李山的意见。许多同志用具体事例说明：当前我国人民生产积极性高涨不是物质的刺激，而是政治挂帅，是共产主义的教育的结果。为共产主义而忘我地劳动已成为今天的主流。
    在10月29日的一期上，又发表了读者白岐山的来信。白岐山的思想情况归结起来有两点：一、他认为实行供给制会使单身汉吃亏，工作使不上劲；二、他想积钱买辆自行车，听说要实行供给制，不买了，怕归公。编辑部希望大家对白岐山的思想进行讨论。
