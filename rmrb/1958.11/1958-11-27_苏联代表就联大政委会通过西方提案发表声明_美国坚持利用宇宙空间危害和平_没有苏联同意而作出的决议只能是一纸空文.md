Xinhua News Agency, November 26th Dispatch from New York (TASS): The head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, Zorin, held a press conference today to issue a statement regarding the United States' forceful passage of its proposal on the peaceful use of outer space through the UN General Assembly's Political Committee.

The statement pointed out that during the discussion of the peaceful use of outer space, the U.S. representative repeatedly avoided discussing the issue of prohibiting the use of outer space for military purposes and refused to discuss the issue of abolishing U.S. military bases on other countries' territories, which is closely related to this. This situation proves that the U.S. government is unwilling to abandon its aggressive policy of establishing and expanding military bases in many countries, and is unwilling to stop its practice of using outer space to conduct rocket and nuclear weapons race that endangers peace.

After describing the Soviet Union's persistent efforts to resolve this issue and the U.S.'s repeated acts of sabotage and obstruction, the statement pointed out that the Political Committee's meeting on November 24th fully confirmed that the U.S. delegation refused to engage in any negotiations to reach mutually acceptable agreements. All the words and deeds of the U.S. delegation show that the U.S. government is not interested in reaching an agreement. Because of this, the U.S. delegation openly sabotaged the work of establishing an international organization for the peaceful research and utilization of outer space.

The statement of the Soviet delegation emphasized that the Soviet delegation, like many other national delegations, believes that it is necessary to have the voluntary agreement of the member states of the United Nations, especially those mainly concerned in this regard, namely the Soviet Union and the United States, which are now engaged in major work in the field of research and mastery of outer space, in order to establish an international committee within the framework of the United Nations to carry out cooperation in the peaceful research and utilization of outer space. Therefore, any decision made by the committee or the United Nations General Assembly without the consent of the countries concerned, especially the Soviet Union and the United States, will have no practical significance and will only be a worthless piece of paper. The U.S.'s attempt to impose its will on others in this regard will not yield any good results. The Soviet Union cannot participate in such a U.S.-controlled committee, nor is it willing to accept this unilateral resolution.

The statement concluded by pointing out that the Political Committee's adoption of this unilateral decision is undoubtedly a wrong step, which undermines the foundation for any effective cooperation in this important field of mankind. The committee established in this way cannot become an institution for cooperation in the peaceful use of outer space, and it is bound to be doomed to ineffectiveness, just like many other committees established in the United Nations under the pressure of the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, November 26th Dispatch from New York: After twelve days of discussions in the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee on the issue of the peaceful use of outer space, the United States finally disregarded all the efforts made by the Soviet delegation to reach an agreement and rejected the Soviet proposals. Under its manipulation, the Political Committee passed the twenty-nation proposal of the Western bloc on the 24th by a vote of fifty-four to nine, with eighteen abstentions. This once again exposed that the United States fundamentally does not want to truly reach an agreement that is conducive to ensuring the security of all countries and implementing international cooperation in the peaceful use of outer space.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Zorin, pointed out that the U.S. position shows that it is unwilling to negotiate, but wants to impose its will on the United Nations. It is responsible for undermining international cooperation in the peaceful use of outer space. Zorin also pointed out that a resolution passed without Soviet agreement will be a worthless piece of paper.

Apart from the Western bloc countries headed by the United States, anyone who recognizes the outstanding contribution made by the Soviet Union in launching the first artificial satellite, thereby opening up mankind's path to the universe, has expressed that international cooperation in the peaceful use of outer space cannot have satisfactory results without the participation of the Soviet Union.

Originally, the Soviet delegation submitted proposals to the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee on prohibiting the use of outer space for military purposes, removing military bases of various countries in other countries' territories, and on international cooperation in the study of outer space. This is the fundamental way to resolve the peaceful use of outer space. However, the United States is unwilling to abandon its military bases around the world, and fundamentally does not want to conclude an agreement on prohibiting the use of outer space for military purposes. Therefore, it tried its best to obstruct the Soviet proposals and insisted on establishing a special committee to study the control of outer space.

In order to enable the meeting to achieve some results as much as possible, the Soviet delegation submitted new proposals to the Political Committee on the 18th. It proposed the establishment of an international cooperation committee within the United Nations to study the peaceful use of outer space, and the establishment of a preparatory group to draft the program and charter of this international committee. The Soviet Union suggested that this international committee be composed of countries such as the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, India, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, the United Arab Republic, Sweden, and Argentina. This proposal fully expressed the Soviet Union's sincerity in hoping to reach an agreement. The composition of the committee it proposed provided the possibility for truly effective international cooperation.

However, the United States adopted a completely opposite attitude. Not only did it not take a step forward, but it also made a fuss about the membership of the committee. It insisted on reducing the number of socialist countries in the list proposed by the Soviet Union, and increasing Canada, Italy, Belgium, Iran, Mexico, Japan, Australia, and Brazil, which support the U.S. position on the vast majority of issues. Among the eighteen countries proposed by the United States to form this committee, twelve countries have formed various groups with the United States, which guarantees that the United States has an absolute majority in this organization, which is conducive to U.S. manipulation.

During the discussion, apart from those Western bloc countries that followed the United States step by step, all countries that hoped to carry out effective international cooperation in the peaceful use of outer space and eliminate the threat of war welcomed and supported the Soviet proposals, and were worried that the United States would use outer space for aggressive purposes. For example, representatives from Indonesia, the United Arab Republic, India, and Burma expressed such opinions and wishes.

    苏联代表就联大政委会通过西方提案发表声明
    美国坚持利用宇宙空间危害和平
    没有苏联同意而作出的决议只能是一纸空文
    据新华社26日讯　据塔斯社纽约25日讯：苏联出席联合国大会代表团团长佐林今天在记者招待会上就美国强使联合国大会政治委员会通过美国所提出的关于和平利用宇宙空间的提案一事发表声明。
    声明指出，在讨论和平利用宇宙空间问题的过程中，美国代表一再回避讨论关于禁止利用宇宙空间达到军事目的的问题，并且拒绝讨论与此有密切关系的取消美国在别国领土上的军事基地问题。这种情况证明了美国政府不愿意放弃它在许多国家境内建立和扩大军事基地的侵略政策，不愿意停止利用宇宙空间进行危害和平的火箭和原子武器竞赛的做法。
    声明在叙述了苏联为解决这个问题而进行的坚持努力和美国一再施行的破坏阻挠策略以后指出，政治委员会11月24日的会议完全证实了，美国代表团拒绝为了达成互相能够接受的协议而进行任何谈判。美国代表团的全部言行表明，美国政府对达成协议不感兴趣。正因为如此，美国代表团就公开破坏了设立和平研究和利用宇宙空间的国际机构的工作。
    苏联代表团的声明强调说，苏联代表团同其他许多国家代表团一样，认为必须有联合国成员国、首先是在这方面主要有关的国家，即现在研究和掌握宇宙空间方面进行主要工作的苏联和美国的自愿的同意，才有可能在联合国范围内建立一个在和平研究和利用宇宙空间方面实行合作的国际委员会。因此，委员会或联合国大会不经有关国家同意、首先是苏联和美国的同意而作出的任何决定都不会有任何现实意义只能是一纸空文。美国想在这方面把它的意志强加于人的企图不会得到任何良好的结果。苏联不能参加这种受美国控制的委员会，也不愿意接受这个单方面的决议。
    声明最后指出，政治委员会通过这种单方面的决定无疑是一个错误的步骤，这个步骤破坏了在人类这个重要领域中进行任何有成效的合作的基础。通过这种方式所建立的委员会不可能成为在和平利用宇宙空间方面进行合作的机构，它必然同由于美国的压力下在联合国中建立的很多其他委员会一样，注定是不能有所作为的。
    据新华社26日讯　纽约消息：在联合国大会政治委员会就和平利用宇宙空间问题讨论了十二天之后，美国终于不顾苏联代表团为达成协议而作的种种努力，而拒绝了苏联的建议。在它的操纵下，政治委员会在24日以五十四票对九票、十八票弃权，通过了西方集团的二十国提案。这就再次暴露了美国根本不希望真正达成有利于保障所有国家的安全和在和平利用宇宙空间方面实行国际合作的协议。
    苏联代表团团长佐林指出，美国的立场表明了它不愿意进行谈判。而是要把它的意志强加在联合国身上。它要对破坏和平利用宇宙空间的国际合作负责。佐林还指出，没有苏联同意而通过的决议，将是一纸空文。
    除以美国为首的西方集团国家外，凡是认识到苏联在发射第一个人造卫星从而开辟了人类通向宇宙的道路作出卓越贡献的人都表示，在和平利用宇宙空间方面的国际合作如果没有苏联参加，就不可能有完满的结果。
    本来，苏联代表团向联合国大会政治委员会提出了禁止利用宇宙空间来达到军事目的、撤除各国在别国境内的军事基地和关于研究宇宙空间方面进行国际合作的建议。这是根本解决和平利用宇宙空间的道路。但是，美国不愿意放弃它遍布世界各地的军事基地，也根本不希望缔结关于禁止在军事方面利用宇宙空间的协定，因此，它竭力阻挠苏联的建议，而坚持主张成立一个专门委员会来研究对宇宙空间的控制。
    为了使会议尽可能取得一些成果，苏联代表团在18日向政治委员会提出了新的建议。它建议在联合国范围内成立研究和平利用宇宙空间的国际合作委员会，并且成立一个筹备小组来起草这个国际委员会的纲领和章程。苏联建议，这个国际委员会由苏、美、英、法、印度、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、罗马尼亚、阿拉伯联合共和国、瑞典和阿根廷等国组成。这个建议充分表示了苏联希望达成协议的诚意。它所建议的委员会的组成，提供了真正有效的国际合作的可能性。
    但是，美国竟采取了完全相反的态度，它不但没有前进一步，反而在委员会的成员问题上大作文章。它坚持减少苏联所提名单中的社会主义国家，而增加在绝大多数问题上都支持美国立场的加拿大、意大利、比利时、伊朗、墨西哥、日本、澳大利亚和巴西。在美国所提出的组成这个委员会的十八个国家中，有十二国同美国结成各种集团，这就保证美国在这个组织中拥有绝对多数，以利于美国的操纵。
    在讨论过程中，除了那些对美国亦步亦趋的西方集团国家外，凡是希望在和平利用宇宙空间方面进行有效的国际合作和消除战争威胁的国家，都欢迎和支持苏联的建议，并且担心美国利用宇宙空间达到侵略的目的。例如，印度尼西亚、阿拉伯联合共和国、印度、缅甸等国的代表，都表示了这种意见和愿望。
