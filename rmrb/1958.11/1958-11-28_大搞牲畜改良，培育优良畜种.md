Vigorously Promote Livestock Improvement and Cultivate Superior Breeds
By People's Daily Commentator

This year, the propagation of various livestock in our country has seen a flying leap in development, and the speed of improving livestock breeds has also accelerated accordingly. As of now, the number of ewes crossbred with improved breeds has reached 7.14 million; the number of mares crossbred with improved breeds has also developed to 270,000, and the number of yellow cattle improved with dairy bulls totals 380,000. The livestock after improvement have shown significant improvements in production performance. According to typical surveys, the draft power of first-generation hybrid horses generally increases by 50%; the milk production of first-generation hybrid cattle generally increases by more than 100%; and the size of first-generation hybrid sheep increases, and wool production increases by more than 100%. These hybrid livestock are universally loved by the masses.

However, it should also be seen that the speed of livestock improvement is far from meeting the needs of developing animal husbandry production. Especially after the nationwide realization of people's communes and the comprehensive development of industry, agriculture, forestry, fishery, and sideline occupations, there is a greater need for strong draft animals; after the universal establishment of nurseries, kindergartens, "happiness homes," and maternity hospitals, the demand for livestock products such as milk, meat, and eggs has also greatly increased. Therefore, developing improved livestock breeds and increasing livestock physique and product yield have become extremely important tasks at present.

The main problem in the current work of developing improved livestock breeds is that many areas do not have enough breeding sires, and therefore, there has been a phenomenon of competitive purchasing. This phenomenon reflects, on the one hand, that in this year's great leap forward in animal husbandry production, the work on breeding livestock has also leaped forward, and the enthusiasm of the masses in various places to develop animal husbandry production is very high; on the other hand, it also shows that the work on breeding livestock is still very backward and must be greatly strengthened.

Can the problem of insufficient breeding sires be solved? It can be solved completely. Our country is not a country lacking in improved breeds, but a country with many improved breeds. For example, the well-known Sanhe horse, Yili horse, Qin Chuan cattle, Nanyang cattle, Binzhou dairy cattle, Xinjiang fine-wool sheep, Zhongwei goats, New Jinhua pigs, Jin Hua pigs, New Langshan chickens, Beijing ducks, Lionhead geese, etc., are all good breeds with different excellent characteristics painstakingly cultivated by the working people of our country. The reason why we felt that there were not enough breeding livestock in the past is that some comrades were superstitious about foreign improved breeds, underestimated domestic improved breeds, and were only willing to use foreign improved breeds for improvement, and were unwilling to use domestic improved breeds for improvement. Many foreign improved breeds are indeed very good and should be actively adopted, but we cannot limit the scope of our selection of breeding livestock to this small circle. Especially in the case of insufficient improved breeds imported from abroad, we must use domestic improved breeds and vigorously explore local improved breeds. If we also adopt the approach of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" in improving livestock breeds, the situation of insufficient breeding sires can be greatly alleviated.

The distribution of breeding livestock in our country is not balanced enough, with some places having more and some places having less. It is also difficult to achieve balance in a short period of time. Therefore, another way to solve the shortage of breeding livestock is to mobilize various places to support and adjust each other in terms of breeding livestock. Now that this method is proposed, the masses in various places can accept it.

This year, the country has mutually supported and adjusted various breeding sires, totaling more than 23,000 heads. It has played a great role in promoting the work of livestock improvement. We must continue to carry forward this spirit of communist cooperation.

The third way to solve the shortage of breeding sires is to promote artificial insemination and give full play to the role of existing breeding sires. At present, many areas still use natural mating methods, and a breeding sire only mates with dozens or even only a few females each year. Therefore, in the future, it is necessary to promote artificial insemination and expand the number of females mated by each breeding sire. Many areas that have adopted artificial insemination methods have achieved relatively large results in this regard. The "Wuhua" breeding station in Shangdu County, Hebei Province, inseminated 21,254 ewes with one breeding ram; the Nong'an Stud Farm in Jilin Province inseminated 1,200 mares with one breeding stallion; and the Xichong County in Sichuan Province inseminated 8,199 cows with two breeding bulls. These facts also show that the general public has changed the past erroneous views on artificial insemination and can quickly master this technology.

Strengthening the feeding and management of livestock is also a noteworthy issue. In the development of livestock improvement and the cultivation of superior breeds, the feeding and management work must be done well. For example, building reasonable livestock sheds, producing sufficient feed, allocating sufficient high-quality feed for improved livestock and improved offspring, doing a good job in cleaning and hygiene, strengthening the prevention and control of animal diseases, and ensuring the healthy development of improved livestock, etc. The Daxing Work Area of the Hero People's Commune in Changtu County, Liaoning Province, selected forty-two excellent hybrid foals and transferred model breeders to carefully feed them. In addition to feeding the foals sufficient grass and feed, they also added succulent feed and mineral feed. As a result, the foals developed well. This feeding and management method is also worth referring to and learning from by other people's communes.

Solving the current shortage of breeding livestock and realizing the breeding of livestock with improved breeds is an arduous task. We must strengthen leadership, mobilize the masses, conduct timely inspections, and summarize and promote experience in a timely manner in order to push the work of cultivating improved breeds to a new climax.

    大搞牲畜改良，培育优良畜种
    本报评论员
    今年我国各种牲畜的增殖有着飞跃的发展，改良畜种的速度，也就随着加快。截至目前为止，用良种杂交配种的母羊已经达到七百一十四万头；用良种杂交的母马也发展到二十七万匹，用奶公牛改良的黄牛共有三十八万头。经过改良的牲畜，生产性能都有显著的提高。根据典型调查证明：一代杂种马挽力一般提高50％；一代杂种牛的产奶量一般提高一倍以上；一代杂种羊体格增大，产毛量提高一倍以上。这些杂种牲畜普遍受到群众的喜爱。
    但是也应该看到，改良牲畜的速度还远远不能满足发展畜牧生产的需要。特别在全国实现人民公社化，工业、农业、林业、渔业和副业全面发展以后，需要体强力壮的耕畜更多；在普遍成立托儿所、幼儿园、幸福院、妇产院以后，奶、肉、蛋等畜产品的需要量也大大增加。因此发展改良牲畜，提高牲畜体质和产品率，就成为当前极为重要的一项工作。
    当前发展改良畜种工作中的主要问题是，不少地区种公畜不够用，并且因此发生了争购的现象。这种现象一方面反映了今年畜牧生产大跃进中种畜工作也随着大跃进，各地群众发展畜牧生产的干劲很大，另一方面也说明了种畜工作还很落后，必须大大加强。
    种畜不足的问题是不是可以解决呢？完全可以解决。我国不是缺乏良种的国家，而是拥有许多良种的国家。例如大家所熟知的三河马、伊犁马、秦川牛、南阳牛、滨洲奶牛、新疆细毛羊、中卫山羊、新金猪、金华猪、新狼山鸡、北京鸭、狮头鹅等，都是我国劳动人民辛勤培养出来的具有不同优良特性的好品种。过去所以感到种畜不足，是有些同志迷信国外良种，轻视国产良种，只愿意引用国外良种进行改良，不愿意运用国产良种进行改良。许多国外良种的确很好，应该积极采用，但是不能把我们选用种畜的范围局限在这小圈子里。特别是在国外引进的良种不足的情况下，就必须引用国内的良种和大力发掘本地的良种。如果我们在改良畜种上也采用“土洋并举”的做法，种公畜不足的局面就可以大大缓和。
    我国种畜分布是不够平衡的，有的地方多，有的地方少。在短时间内，也很难求得平衡。因此，解决种畜不足的另一个办法，就是发动各地在种畜上互相支援互相调剂。现在提出这个办法，各地群众是可以接受的。
    今年，全国互相支援互相调剂各种种公畜共达二万三千多头。对于种畜改良工作起了很大的推动作用。还要继续发扬这种共产主义协作精神。
    解决种公畜不足的第三个办法，是提倡人工授精，充分发挥现有种公畜的作用。现在许多地区还采取自然交配的方法，一头良种公畜每年只配种几十头，甚至只配几头。因此，今后必须提倡人工授精，扩大每头种公畜的配种头数。不少采用人工授精方法的地区，在这方面已经取得了比较大的成绩。河北省商都县“五花”配种站一头种公羊输精配种母羊二万一千二百五十四只；吉林省农安种马场一匹种公马输精配种母马一千二百匹；四川省西充县两头种公牛输精配种母牛八千一百九十九头。这些事实也说明，一般群众已经转变了过去那种对人工授精工作的错误的看法，并且可以很快掌握人工授精这种技术。
    加强牲畜的饲养管理，也是值得注意的一个问题。在发展牲畜改良、培育优良种畜工作中，必须做好饲养管理工作。例如建筑合理的畜舍，生产足够的饲料，对于良种牲畜和改良的后代应该拨出足够的、质量好的饲料，做好清洁卫生，加强兽疫防治，保证良种牲畜发育健壮等等。辽宁省昌图县英雄人民公社大兴作业区，选择了优良杂种马驹四十二头，抽调了模范饲养员精心喂养。他们除了给马驹喂足草料外，还加喂多汁饲料和矿物饲料，因之，马驹发育良好，这种饲养管理方法，也是值得其他人民公社参考学习的。
    解决当前种畜不足和实现牲畜良种化，是一项艰巨的工作，必须加强领导，发动群众，及时检查，及时总结和推广经验，才能把培育良种工作推向新的高潮。
