Shi Dong Elementary School Summarizes: Cultivating Collectivism Spirit, Close Integration of Teaching and Labor, Closer Teacher-Student Relationship, Cultivating Children's Independent Living Ability, Reducing Parents' Burden and Liberating Rural Labor Force.

(Reported by our correspondents Liu Zongtang and Fan Sui from Chengdu) Shi Dong Elementary School in Shunjiang People's Commune, Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, has shown great superiority since implementing student boarding. The commune, teachers, students, and parents are all very satisfied. The Neijiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that this is a major measure to strengthen children's social education and cultivate communist new people, and it is now being promoted throughout the county with emphasis. Student boarding at Shi Dong Elementary School began at the end of September, and the effect has been very good for more than a month. According to the school's summary, there are five major advantages to student boarding.

	First, it can better conduct communist education for children and cultivate students' collectivist thinking. After students board, their life, work, and study are all together, and the school becomes a big family. Shi Dong Elementary School also organizes them according to "military action, combat learning, and collective life," so that students receive collectivist education not only in the classroom, but also anytime and anywhere. A prominent change since students boarded is that they care for the collective everywhere and are united and friendly with each other. Some students who did not abide by discipline and did not care about the collective in the past have undergone significant changes.

	Second, it promotes students' labor education to a new stage, makes teaching and production arrangements more appropriate, integrates them more closely, and greatly improves production and teaching quality. After students board, the entire school's teachers and students form a unified labor force, with teachers as production team leaders and students as members; teaching while producing, production and learning are organically combined, and students do not have to run home for eating and sleeping. This increases labor time without reducing teaching time.

	Third, after students board, teachers and students eat, live, work, and study together, and the teacher-student relationship undergoes profound changes. Teachers care for students like parents, not only teaching knowledge, but also teaching people, and they take care of students' learning and life. Students also respect and love teachers more than ever.

	Fourth, cultivate children's independent living ability. After students boarded, Shi Dong Elementary School immediately led students to establish organizations, and all life is managed by the students themselves, and launched mutual assistance and care, older students take care of younger students, and senior grades take care of lower grades. All cooking, washing, growing vegetables, and environmental sanitation are done by the students themselves. In the past, some students were spoiled by their families and were already old, but they still needed others to wash their faces, bathe, and tidy up their beds. Now even first-grade elementary school students can take care of themselves.

	Fifth, reduce the burden on parents and liberate rural labor. Parents with many children can concentrate on production without worries. When Shi Dong Elementary School began to implement student boarding, it encountered some conservative opposition. They believed that elementary school students were too young to board, and that eating, living, and other issues would not be easy to solve. Facts have proved that as long as we rely closely on the Party committee, rely on the commune, and fully mobilize teachers, students, and parents, all difficulties can be overcome. Shi Dong Elementary School only took three days to solve all the problems of eating, living, and transportation. For more than a month, students have been living well. Many parents came to see their children and were very happy. They repeatedly expressed their gratitude to the school, believing that they were being taken care of even more thoughtfully than at home.

    小学生住校五大好
    史东小学总结：培养集体主义精神  教学劳动密切结合　师生关系更加亲密  培养儿童独立生活能力　减轻家长负担和解放农村劳动力。
    本报成都电　记者刘宗棠、范眭报道：四川省内江县顺江人民公社史东小学实行学生住校后，显示了极大的优越性，公社、教师、学生、家长四方面都很满意。中共内江县委认为这是加强儿童社会教育，培养共产主义新人的一项重大措施，现已在全县重点推广。史东小学学生住校是在9月底开始的，一个多月来，效果很好。据该校总结，学生住校有五大优点。
    一、能更好地向儿童进行共产主义教育，培养学生的集体主义思想。学生住校后，生活、劳动、学习都在一起，学校成了一个大家庭。史东小学又根据“行动军事化、学习战斗化、生活集体化”把他们组织起来，这样，学生不仅在课堂，而是随时随地都受到集体主义教育。学生住校以来，一个突出的变化是处处关心集体，相互团结友爱。一些过去不遵守纪律，不关心集体的学生，已有显著的转变。
    二、把学生劳动教育推向一个新的阶段，使教学和生产安排得更恰当，结合得更密切，生产和教学质量都有很大提高。学生住校后，全校师生统一成立了一支劳动大军，老师当生产队长，学生是队员；一边生产，一边教书，生产和学习有机地结合在一起，学生不必跑路回家吃睡。使劳动时间增多，教学时间却没有减少。
    三、学生住校后，教师和学生同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习，师生关系发生了深刻的变化。老师像父母一样爱护学生，不仅教书，而且教人，对学生的学习、生活都要过问。学生对老师也比任何时候更加尊敬和热爱。
    四、培养儿童独立生活能力。史东小学在学生住校后，立即领导学生建立组织，一切生活都由学生自己管理，并发动相互帮助照顾，大同学照顾小同学，高年级照顾低年级。所有煮饭、洗衣、种菜、环境卫生等都由学生自己去做。过去有些学生由于家庭溺爱，年龄已经大了，但洗脸、洗澡和整理床铺都还要别人代做。现在一年级的小学生也能自己照顾自己。
    五、减轻家长负担，解放农村劳动力，子女多的家长，能安心生产，无后顾之虑。史东小学在开始实行学生住校时，曾遇到一些保守主义的反对。他们认为小学生年龄小，不适宜住校，有关吃、住等问题也不好解决。事实证明，只要紧密依靠党委、依靠公社，充分发动师生和家长，一切困难都容易克服。史东小学只用了三天时间，就把吃、住、行等问题都全部解决。一个多月来，学生生活很好，许多家长来看望自己子女后，非常高兴，一再向学校表示感谢，认为比在家里照顾得还周到。
