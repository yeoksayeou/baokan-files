    Fighting on Arctic Ice Floe Station
    By Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Nan
    Severe winter has already descended on the Arctic. The long polar night envelops the perpetually frozen ice floes. However, no matter how harsh the natural conditions, they cannot suppress the heroic Soviet people's will to conquer nature. The Soviet "North Pole 7" ice floe station is conducting scientific research normally and uninterruptedly under conditions of complete darkness and severe cold. This left a very deep impression on the reporter who had just set foot on the central Arctic ice floe.
    The reporter arrived in the central Arctic region. After arriving here, I met the brave people who were wintering at this high-latitude scientific station.
    Our plane took off from Dixon on the 20th and arrived at the intermediate station on Franz Josef Land that day. The weather here was very bad, with strong winds, heavy clouds, and a genuine polar blizzard. We were forced to stay here for four days. On the 24th, as soon as the blizzard stopped, we immediately took off and flew towards the last few degrees of latitude north. We flew over the Arctic Ocean ice all the way. Four hours passed quickly. The navigator informed us that the ice floe station was under the wings. Soon, the plane landed at the airport opened on the Arctic ice floe.
    This is the central Arctic region, known as the "Top of the World." Not long ago, reaching this inaccessible area was considered a remarkable achievement, but now we flew here in a few hours. It is the first time that a large group of foreign reporters has visited the Arctic. The flight situation shows that the Soviet polar flying team is an excellent flying team.
    The scenery here is indescribably beautiful. The North Star is twinkling overhead, and the stars appear particularly bright in the dark sky. The moon hangs timidly in the sky. Looking around, there is an endless expanse of ice and snow everywhere. In the distance, icebergs can be faintly seen, standing there like walls. However, the wind is very strong and the weather is extremely cold.
    The polar staff warmly and kindly received us at the station. Looking ahead, we saw a complete village in front of us. A red banner was hung over the gate, which read: "North Pole 7" welcomes you. A red national flag fluttered on the radio tower. Helicopters, tractors and off-road vehicles were parked nearby. There is a tent in the center of many houses. We walked into the tent, which was as warm as spring. We also visited the radio center, power station, bathroom and conference room. The ice floe station is well-equipped, and the houses and tents are not only warm but also bright. Four or five people live in one tent and work together. The staff at the station maintains normal contact with the mainland, and planes often deliver newspapers and letters.
    This station was established in April 1957. Since May 21, 1937, when the Soviet Union established the world's first Arctic central scientific station, "North Pole 1," in the Arctic, a total of seven ice floe stations have appeared here. Now "North Pole 7" has begun to experience its second winter. The ice floe station is about two thousand kilometers away from the mainland coast, and its current position is 86 degrees 38 minutes north latitude and 29 degrees 6 minutes 36 seconds west longitude. There are a total of twenty-eight people at the station. Since the establishment of the station, the staff has been conducting systematic observations every day. They measure the depth of the ocean, take soil samples from the ocean floor, determine the flow velocity of the polar ocean, study the ice floe layer, and comprehensively study the Arctic weather and various meteorological phenomena, as well as the magnetic field strength and other geophysical phenomena.
    The residents of the ice floe station have not seen the sun for two months. It is currently the long Arctic night, and daylight will not appear until March next year. The staff of the ice floe station live in severe cold, darkness, and rapid ice floe drift. In winter, the Arctic uses its most powerful weapons to fight against mankind. This does bring many difficulties to the people at the station. But in the fierce battle with nature, the Soviet people have won. The scientific work at the station has not been interrupted for a day, not even for a minute. Upper-air meteorologists routinely launch radiosonde balloons, oceanographers measure the depth and velocity of the ocean, and meteorologists continuously observe the weather. Their work is even busier in winter.
    It is truly gratifying to see the Soviet people developing the Arctic mile by mile, degree by degree, and to see the cold and the polar night being overcome. We are indeed sincerely happy. We unanimously express our gratitude to the Soviet people, the Party, and the Soviet government for providing journalists from our people's democratic countries and other countries with the opportunity to understand the tenacious struggle launched by the heroic Soviet people here to conquer nature and benefit mankind.

    战斗在北极浮冰站上
    新华社记者　李楠
    严冬已经在北极降临。极地的漫漫长夜笼罩着终年不化的浮冰层。但是，无论多么严酷的自然条件，都抑制不住英雄的苏维埃人征服大自然的意志。苏联“北极七号”浮冰站在一片漆黑和严寒的气候条件下，正常而不间断地进行着科学研究工作。这一点给刚刚踏上北极中心浮冰的记者留下了极深刻的印象。
    记者到达了北极的中心地区。到这里以后会见了在这个高纬度科学站上过冬的勇敢的人们。
    我们的飞机于20日由迪克森起飞，当天到达佛兰兹约瑟夫岛上的中间站。这里的天气很坏，狂风大作，阴云密布，还来了一场地地道道的极地暴风雪。我们被迫在这里呆了四天。24日，暴风雪刚一停止，我们立即起飞，向着北纬的最后几度飞行。我们一路上一直在北冰洋冰层的上空飞行。四小时很快地消逝了。领航员通知我们，机翼下就是浮冰站。不久，飞机就在北极浮冰上开辟出来的飞机场降落。
    这里就是号称“世界之顶”的北极中心地区。还在不久以前，到达这个难以到达的地区还被认为是一件了不起的事情，现在我们几个小时就飞到了这里。一大批外国记者访问北极，这还是第一次。飞行的情况表明，苏联的极地飞行队是十分出色的飞行队。
    这里的风景有说不出的优美。北极星就在头顶上闪烁着，星星在黝黑的天空中显得分外明亮。月亮寒怯怯地挂在天空。举目四望，到处是一望无际的冰雪。远方隐约地可以看到垒垒冰山，像一堵堵墙壁竖在那里。但是，风刮得很厉害，天气十分严寒。
    极地的工作人员在站上热情而亲切地接待了我们。举目一望，在我们的前面是一座完整的村落。在大门上挂着一条红色的横幅，上面写着：“北极七号”欢迎你们。在无线电塔上飘扬着红色的国旗。左近停放着直升飞机、拖拉机和越野车。在很多房子的中心有一个帐篷。我们走进了帐篷，里面温暖如春。我们还参观了无线电中心、发电站、浴室和大会议室。浮冰站的设备精良，房子和帐篷里不仅温暖，而且明亮。四、五个人住一个帐篷，一块进行工作。站上的人员同大陆保持着正常的联系，经常有飞机送来报纸和信件。
    这个站是在1957年4月建立的。从1937年5月21日苏联在北极建立世界第一座北极中心科学站——“北极一号”起，这里一共出现了七个浮冰站。现在“北极七号”已经开始经历第二个冬天。浮冰站距离大陆海岸约二千公里远，现在的位置是北纬八十六度三十八分和西经二十九度六分三十六秒。站上一共有二十八人。从建站以来，工作人员每天都在进行有系统的观测。他们测量大洋的深度，从洋底取出土样，测定极地海洋的流速，研究浮冰层，全面地研究北极的天气和各种气象现象，以及磁场强度和其他地球物理现象。
    浮冰站的居民已经两个月不见太阳了。目前正是北极漫长的寒夜的时候，要到明年3月才会有白天出现。浮冰站的人员在严寒、漆黑和浮冰漂流迅速的情况下过日子。北极在冬天动用了它同人类作斗争的最有力武器。这的确给站上的人带来不少困难。但是在同大自然进行的激烈搏斗中，苏联人获得了胜利。站上的科学工作一天也没有间断，一分钟也没有间断。高空气象学家照常放起无线电探空气球，海洋学家测量大洋的深度和流速，气象学家不断地观察天气。冬季他们的工作更加繁忙。
    看到苏联人一浬又一浬地、一度又一度地开发着北极，看到寒冷被战胜，极地的长夜被战胜，真是令人高兴。我们的确是从心里感到高兴。我们同声一致地对苏联人民、党和苏联政府表示感谢，感谢他们对我们人民民主国家和其他国家的记者提供机会，以了解英雄的苏维埃人为征服自然、造福人类在这里展开的顽强斗争。（附图片）
