Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 19th. According to Hong Kong pro-Chiang newspapers, the morale of Taiwan's military and political personnel is very depressed due to the publication of the Chiang-Dulles talks communique and the crushing defeat of the US Republican Party in the mid-term elections.

Hong Kong's "Kung Sheung Daily News" recently published a dispatch from its Taiwan correspondent stating, "In Taipei, a brief contact with political figures reveals a difficult-to-describe somber atmosphere. The current political situation can be described as a long drought hoping for rain, but the heavens are only covered with dense clouds."

This pro-Chiang newspaper stated that the Chiang-Dulles talks communique, issued under Dulles' pressure, has clearly placed the Taiwan authorities "at a low ebb in political prestige." Moreover, the "new policies" of the Chiang-Dulles talks communique "have not gained unanimous support from anti-communist figures at home and abroad, and voices of criticism are coming one after another. Obviously, many people still do not quite understand why the government (referring to the Taiwan authorities) suddenly made such a large concession to the United States."

The dispatch said, "Unfortunately, in the US elections, the Democratic Party won a great victory, and the Republican Party suffered a defeat that would make anyone cry out in misery." This event caused Taiwan Kuomintang figures to "feel some pain. In particular, the defeat of Senator Knowland, who has been the most ardent advocate for China (Chiang) in the US Congress for more than a decade, in his bid for Governor of California, made every person in Free China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) sigh with regret." The dispatch said that this "series of facts has created a low political pressure in (Taiwan), making people feel depressed."

Hong Kong's other pro-Chiang newspaper, "Astronomical Observatory" bi-weekly, stated, "Recently, Taiwan political figures generally have depressed expressions, and it is difficult to see them smile." The newspaper said that the reason for the depression is that the publication of the Chiang-Dulles talks communique caused the Taiwan authorities to "suffer a great blow." Another reason is the Republican Party's crushing defeat in the US mid-term elections. "Taiwan political figures are stimulated by these unsatisfactory events, so their melancholy cannot but overflow from their faces." This pro-Chiang newspaper advised the Taiwan authorities to regard the current adverse situation after the publication of the Chiang-Dulles communique as a good opportunity for "enlightenment and exploration." It said that the Taiwan authorities "must have their own solutions" in order to "seek more blessings for themselves."

    遭受蒋杜会谈和美国选举两度打击
    台湾政治气压低沉
    香港亲蒋报纸劝台湾当局“自求多福”
    新华社广州19日电　据香港亲蒋报纸报道，由于蒋杜会谈公报发表和美国共和党在中期选举中大遭惨败，台湾军政人员的情绪十分忧郁。
    香港“工商日报”最近发表它驻台湾记者的通讯说，“在台北，与政坛人物稍一接触，会察觉到一种难以描述的沉闷气氛。当前的政局，可以说是久旱望雨，但老天却是密云不雨。”
    这家亲蒋报纸说，在杜勒斯压迫下发表的蒋杜会谈公报，显然已经使台湾当局“在政治的威望上正处于一个低潮”。而蒋杜会谈公报的“新政策并不曾取得海内外反共人士的一致支持，抨击的声音纷至沓来。显然，今天还有许多人不甚明了政府（指台湾当局）忽然对美国作此大让步的原因”。
    这篇通讯说，“十分不凑巧，在美国的选举中，民主党大获全胜，共和党败得使任何人也会叫声好惨。”这事使台湾国民党人士“感受到一些创痛。尤其是十数年来一直为美国国会中倡援华（蒋）之议最力的诺兰参议员竞选加州州长败北，更使每一个自由中国（指蒋介石集团）的人为之扼腕”。通讯说，这“一连串的事实，造成了（台湾）政治上的一股低气压，令人感到沉闷”。
    香港另一家亲蒋报纸“天文台”双日刊说，“近来台湾政界人士一般都表情忧郁，人们很难看到他们的笑脸。”这家报纸说，造成忧郁的原因是蒋杜会谈公报发表后，使台湾当局“受到极大的打击”。另一原因是美国中期选举共和党的惨败。“台湾政界人士由于这些不如意事的刺激，故其忧郁之情，便无法不溢于眉宇”。这家亲蒋报纸劝告台湾当局把目前蒋杜公报发表后的恶劣局势视作“愤启、悱发”的良机。它说，台湾当局“必须自己本身有办法”，才能“自求多福”。
