The Great Cause of Socialism and Communism Will Surely Triumph
Bainqen Erdini

On the occasion of the forty-first anniversary of the October Revolution, with confidence in the victory of the socialist revolution and with joy and gratitude, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and all the people who are heroically fighting to defend world peace and the cause of socialism and communism.

For forty-one years, under the wise leadership of the great revolutionary teacher Lenin and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people have established the first socialist country in human history, overcome numerous difficulties and hardships, and built the Soviet Union into a great socialist power, opening up the road to liberation for the proletariat and working people of the world and setting a brilliant example. Now, the Soviet people have overfulfilled five five-year plans for developing the national economy, and the sixth five-year plan is about to be successfully completed. The Soviet Union has achieved leap-forward development and great achievements in economic, cultural, and other fields. The 21st Congress of the CPSU, which will be held early next year, will adopt the program for the development of the economy in the next seven years of communist construction in the Soviet Union. This magnificent construction program will lead and inspire the Soviet people to even greater leaps forward. We believe that in a relatively short period of time, the Soviet Union's industrial and agricultural production will surely catch up with and surpass the United States in an all-round way and victoriously transition to a communist society.

Last year, when we solemnly celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, the world situation witnessed a new turning point favorable to peace and the cause of human progress, thanks to the Soviet Union's first successful launching of artificial earth satellites and the meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of various countries held in Moscow, which further strengthened the unity of the working class around the world. As Chairman Mao pointed out, this is a clear sign that the East wind is prevailing over the West wind, and the socialist camp is prevailing over the imperialist camp. Over the past year, the Soviet Union, our country, and socialist countries have been advancing by leaps and bounds. The economic crisis in the capitalist world, starting with the United States, is spreading. Over the past year, the imperialists' war provocations and acts of aggression in various parts of the world, especially in the Middle East, have been repeatedly defeated. The people of the world have more clearly recognized the hideous face of imperialism and the truth about the paper tiger, which has fallen into unprecedented isolation. It is tightening the noose around its own neck, increasingly approaching the fate of death. In short, the socialist East is prospering and becoming stronger, while the capitalist West is declining and dying. The East wind is rapidly and increasingly prevailing over the West wind.

The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is the decisive force in defending world peace. The great alliance between China and the Soviet Union, their mutual support and unbreakable unity, have become a strong fortress for maintaining world peace. In the struggle against the US imperialists' armed provocations in the Taiwan Strait region of our country, the Soviet government and people have given us firm support. In his letter to Eisenhower on September 19, Chairman Khrushchev said, "An infringement upon the People's Republic of China is an infringement upon the Soviet Union." This fully demonstrates the determination of the people of China and the Soviet Union to share a common hatred of the enemy and defend peace; it also shows the close unity of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union. If the US imperialists dare to ignite the flames of war, they will surely bring about their own destruction.

The great achievements of our country's revolution and construction have always been inseparable from the support and assistance of the Soviet Union and revolutionary forces around the world. The selfless assistance given to our country by the Soviet people in the spirit of great internationalism has played a huge role in accelerating our country's socialist construction. Therefore, the people of all nationalities in our country express their heartfelt gratitude to the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the government, and the people with indescribable gratitude.

The Chinese revolution is a continuation of the great October Revolution and has also achieved a great victory. Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the people of our country are advancing by leaps and bounds at a high speed of "one day equals twenty years" on the road opened up by the October Revolution. In fifteen years or even less, our country will catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products. The people of the whole country are learning from the advanced Soviet people, following the road of the October Revolution, and advancing victoriously on the socialist road under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. In order to resolutely take the socialist road, we must thoroughly implement the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, strengthen the unity between the Han and Tibetan peoples, continue to expand the anti-imperialist patriotic united front, resolutely smash the conspiracies and subversive activities of imperialist elements and counter-revolutionary elements, and build a prosperous and happy new Tibet.

    社会主义、共产主义的伟大事业必定胜利
    班禅额尔德尼
    欣逢十月革命四十一周年的时候，我怀着对社会主义革命胜利的信心，怀着愉快而感激的心情，谨向为保卫世界和平和社会主义、共产主义事业而英勇奋斗的苏联共产党和全体人民致以衷心的祝贺。
    四十一年来，苏联人民在伟大的革命导师列宁和苏联共产党的英明领导下，建立了人类历史上第一个社会主义国家，战胜了重重的艰难困苦，把苏联建成为伟大的社会主义强国，给全世界无产阶级和劳动人民开辟了解放的道路，树立了光辉的榜样。现在，苏联人民已经超额完成了五个发展国民经济的五年计划，第六个五年计划又将胜利完成。苏联不论在经济文化等方面，都获得了飞跃的发展和巨大的成就。明年初即将召开的苏共第二十一次代表大会，将通过苏联在今后七年共产主义建设中发展经济的纲领。这个宏伟的建设纲领，将领导和鼓舞苏联人民更大的跃进。我们相信，在较短的年代中，苏联的工农业生产一定能够全面的赶上和超过美国，并胜利地过渡到共产主义社会。
    去年，在我们隆重地庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候，由于苏联第一次成功地放射了人造地球卫星，由于在莫斯科举行的各国共产党和工人党代表会议，进一步加强了全世界工人阶级的团结，世界形势出现了有利于和平和人类进步事业的新的转折点。正如毛主席所指出的，这是东风压倒西风，社会主义阵营压倒帝国主义阵营的明显标志。一年来，苏联、我国和社会主义各国都在乘风跃进。而从美国开始的资本主义世界的经济危机却正在蔓延。一年来，帝国主义的战争挑衅、侵略行为，在世界各地，特别是在西亚地区，已经不断地遭到失败。全世界人民更清楚地认识到了帝国主义的狰狞面目，和纸老虎的真相，它已经陷入空前孤立的境地。它正在使套在自己脖子上的绞索愈拉愈紧，日益逼近死亡的命运。总之，社会主义的东方正在繁荣强大，资本主义的西方正在没落、死亡，东风正在迅速地更加压倒西风。
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营是保卫世界和平的决定力量。中苏两国的伟大同盟，它们的相互支持和牢不可破的团结，成为维护世界和平的坚强堡垒。我们在坚决反对美帝国主义在我国台湾海峡地区进行武装挑衅的斗争中，苏联政府和人民，给予了我们坚决的支持。赫鲁晓夫主席9月19日给艾森豪威尔的信中说：“对中华人民共和国的侵犯，就是对苏联的侵犯”。这充分显示了中苏两国人民同仇敌忾，保卫和平的决心；同时也显示着以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的亲密团结。如果美帝国主义胆敢燃起战火，必将自取灭亡。
    我国的革命和建设事业的伟大成就，从来就是同苏联以及全世界革命力量的支持和援助分不开的。苏联人民本着伟大的国际主义精神，所给予我国无私的援助，对加速我国的社会主义建设事业有着巨大的作用。因此，我们全国各民族人民都以无可言喻的感激心情，对伟大的苏联共产党、政府和人民表示衷心的感谢。
    中国革命是伟大十月革命的继续，并同样的取得了伟大的胜利。现在，我国人民正在中国共产党的领导下，在十月革命开辟的道路上，以“一天等于二十年”的高速度飞跃前进。在十五年或者在更短的时间内，我国就将在主要的工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国。全国人民正向先进的苏联人民学习，沿着十月革命的道路，在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，在社会主义道路上胜利前进。为了坚决走社会主义道路，我们必须彻底执行和平解放西藏办法的协议，加强汉、藏族人民之间的团结，继续扩大反帝爱国统一战线，坚决粉碎帝国主义分子和反革命分子的阴谋破坏和颠覆活动，建设祖国繁荣幸福的新西藏。　（新华社拉萨6日电）
