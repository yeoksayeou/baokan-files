    Conduct More Problem Discussions
    Recently, many newspapers and periodicals have launched various problem discussions. For example, "China Women" semi-monthly discussed whether working in the service industry is inferior, "Beijing Daily" discussed how to prepare ideologically for the transition to communism, "Wenhui Daily" discussed whether college students should be ordinary laborers, "Southern Daily" discussed how to be a good apprentice, and so on. The People's Daily has also recently been discussing the issue of bourgeois right. I suggest that you organize more problem discussions in the future to raise everyone's awareness and criticize various erroneous ideas.

    多开展问题讨论
    不少报刊近来开展了各种问题讨论。如中国妇女半月刊讨论在服务性行业中工作是否低人一等，北京日报讨论怎样做好向共产主义过渡的思想准备，文汇报讨论大学生要不要做普通劳动者，南方日报讨论怎样当好一个学徒，等等。人民日报最近也在讨论资产阶级法权问题。我建议你们今后多组织问题讨论，以提高大家的认识，批判各种错误思想。
