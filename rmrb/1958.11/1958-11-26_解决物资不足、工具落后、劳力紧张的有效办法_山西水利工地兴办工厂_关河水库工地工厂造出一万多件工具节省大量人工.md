Effective Methods to Solve Shortages of Materials, Backward Tools, and Labor Shortages
    Shanxi Water Conservancy Construction Sites Establish Factories
    Guanhe Reservoir Construction Site Factory Produces Over 10,000 Tools, Saving a Significant Amount of Labor

    (Our newspaper, Taiyuan, November 25th) A mass campaign of establishing factories at large and medium-sized water conservancy construction sites in the Jinnan region of Shanxi Province has become widespread. Throughout the region, 48 cement plants, 32 explosives factories, and a number of tool repair and manufacturing factories have been built at water conservancy construction sites to serve the construction. After the Jin Southeast Special District (formerly Changzhi Special District) organized relevant personnel to visit and exchange experiences regarding the Guanhe Reservoir in Wuxiang County establishing factories to ensure the needs of the engineering construction, various localities are rapidly promoting this approach. Jinbei region is also preparing to hold an on-site meeting at the Guanshang Reservoir construction site in Guoxian County to inspect the problems in winter water conservancy construction in various localities, summarize the experience of the reservoir factory, and exchange and promote it. The responsible comrade of the Shanxi Provincial Agricultural Construction Department stated that the campaign of establishing factories at large and medium-sized water conservancy projects throughout the province will enter a climax in early December.

    Shanxi Province will build a number of large and medium-sized projects in this winter's water conservancy construction, requiring a large number of shovels, hoes, high-altitude soil transportation lines, soil tracks, small flat cars, as well as explosives, simple power equipment, and lifting equipment for blasting earth and stone. Key projects such as the Guanhe Reservoir in Wuxiang County adopted the method of "relying on the masses, self-reliance, making the best of simple conditions, using local materials, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and multi-party cooperation" to establish factories on the construction sites and produce according to needs. As a result, many scarce raw materials and tools were met, ensuring the progress of the project. The Shanxi Provincial leading departments summarized this experience, believing that this provides a new way to solve the current problems of shortages of materials, tools, and labor for newly built large and medium-sized water conservancy projects, and organized various localities to quickly promote it.

    Water conservancy construction sites that have established factories have already shown great results in engineering construction. Originally, the large and medium-sized water conservancy projects in the Jinnan region required 300,000 tons of cement and more than 20,000 tons of explosives, and many of these needs could not be met. After the establishment of 80 cement and explosives factories, 1,800 tons of cement and nearly 40 tons of explosives have been produced, and a batch of detonators and fuses have also been produced. After more than 300 cement and explosives factories are built throughout the region by the beginning of December, they will not only be self-sufficient but also able to support others. The five large reservoir construction sites newly built along the five major tributaries of the Songxi River in Xiyang County have established 14 tool factories, realizing high-line soil transportation, vehicle transportation, and roller compaction. From all aspects, tools are constantly reformed, accelerating project progress, saving labor, and cultivating talent. At the same time, heavy work is replaced by tools, greatly reducing labor intensity.

    (Our newspaper, Taiyuan, November 25th) The Guanhe Reservoir construction site in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, has provided a new way to solve the contradictions of material shortages, backward tools, and labor shortages in the current construction of large and medium-sized water conservancy projects by establishing factories.

    The Guanhe Reservoir is located on the Zhang River in the Taihang Mountains and is one of the three major reservoir projects on the Zhang River. The reservoir has a storage capacity of over 100 million cubic meters, and after completion, it can turn more than 100,000 mu of dry land in the vicinity into irrigated land and 40,000 mu of sandy riverbeds into fertile fields. After building two hydroelectric power stations on the reservoir, it can supply lighting electricity to 400 households, as well as mechanical electricity for local industries and people's communes. The reservoir can also be used to vigorously develop aquaculture and fish farming. This project plays a major role in transforming the harmful river into a beneficial river and changing the appearance of the local mountainous area early.

    When the project started this spring, it encountered a series of difficulties. The cement and explosives needed for the project were often not supplied, and a large amount of mechanical and electrical equipment and lighting equipment were also needed. The existing tools were also very backward, such as only a very small number of a few hundred small flat cars for transporting soil. The reservoir leadership boldly mobilized the masses to think of ways and offer ideas. More than 8,000 big-character posters were written throughout the construction site, and more than 12,000 rationalization proposals were put forward. Many proposals suggested not relying on the state and solving the difficulties by self-reliantly establishing factories. The construction site Party committee accepted these opinions and decided to establish factories on the construction site. The slogan at the time was: "Ask factories for tools, ask tools for labor, do not rely on the state, self-reliance, build ten factories." However, in the face of this new thing, everyone's views were not yet consistent. Some people were skeptical about establishing factories on the construction site, saying: "Workers have no funds, no technology, no materials, how can they do it?" In response to these ideas, the Party committee decided to launch a great airing of views, a great debate in the spirit of rectification. After a ideological debate, everyone had a more unified understanding that politics takes command and relying on the masses can accomplish it.

    In the process of establishing factories, the Party committee closely relied on the masses, so that many unexpected difficulties were solved easily. When building the tool factory, there was a shortage of materials. After the county held a cooperation meeting of 14 people's communes, each commune took out the wood that had been stored for a long time and had not been used to support it. After the cement factory was built, there was a lack of raw materials and it could not be produced. The Red Flag People's Commune automatically organized a brigade to send 20,000 catties of gypsum, ensuring normal production. When solving the technical force, the Party committee adopted the method of doing whatever they could do. Among the more than 5,000 construction workers, nearly 100 workers of twelve types such as carpenters, blacksmiths, weavers, railways, electricity, cement, etc. were found, and 400 people were assigned to them as apprentices. In this way, on a construction site with nothing, reed sheds were built as workshops, and earthen cave dwellings were used as dormitories. In less than ten days, ten factories including cement, explosives, tools, ball bearings, power generation, gypsum, weaving, and steel were established.

    Each construction site factory adopted the method of building and producing at the same time. While building the factory, it created more than 100 new products to meet the needs of the reservoir. In recent months, more than 10,000 tools have been manufactured, enabling the water conservancy construction site to realize soil blasting with earth cannons, high-line soil transportation, railway transportation for long-distance leveling, vehicle transportation for short-distance gentle slopes, automatic wooden rail transportation for steep slopes, high-line transportation for soil transportation across ditches, and ball bearing automation for vehicle wheels, and automatic soil loading and unloading, which greatly reduced the labor intensity of the construction workers and shortened the project time. The original plan was to use 10,000 people to build the reservoir, which would be completed in nine months. As a result, it was completed in just over four months, saving more than one million man-days.

    解决物资不足、工具落后、劳力紧张的有效办法
    山西水利工地兴办工厂
    关河水库工地工厂造出一万多件工具节省大量人工
    本报太原25日电　山西省晋南地区大中型水利建设工地大办工厂活动已经普遍展开。全区已在水利工地上建成了为施工服务的四十八个水泥厂、三十二个炸药厂和一批工具修配厂。晋东南专区（原长治专区）组织有关人员参观交流了武乡县关河水库办工厂、保证工程建设需要的经验后，各地正迅速推广。晋北地区最近也准备在崞县观上水库工地举行现场会议，检查各地冬季水利建设中的问题，一面总结这个水库办工厂的经验，并交流推广。山西省农业建设厅负责同志说，全省大中型水利工程办工厂活动到12月初即将进入高潮。
    山西省在今冬水利建设中将要兴修若干大型和中型工程，需要大量的铁锹、镢头、高空运土线、土轨道、小平车以及供爆破土石方的炸药、简易动力设备、起重设备。武乡县关河水库等重点工程采取“依靠群众，自力更生、因陋就简、就地取材、土洋结合、多方协作”的办法，在工地上办工厂，根据需要生产，结果使许多难得的原料和工具得到了满足，保证了工程进度。山西省领导部门总结了这一经验，认为这为解决当前新建大中型水利工程的物资、工具和劳力紧张问题找到了一个新途径，组织各地迅速加以推广。
    目前已办起工厂的水利工地，在工程建设中已显示出巨大成效。晋南地区原来大中型水利工程需要的水泥三十万吨、炸药二万多吨，很多得不到解决，建立起八十个水泥、炸药厂以后，目前已生产一千八百吨水泥和近四十吨炸药，还生产一批雷管和导火线。到12月初全区建成三百多座水泥厂炸药厂以后，不仅可以自给，还可支援别人。昔阳县沿松溪河五大支流新建的五个大水库工地，由于建起十四座工具厂，实现了高线运土化、车子化、碾压磙子化，从各方面不断改革工具，加速了工程进度，节省了劳力，培养了人材，同时笨重活为工具代替，大大减轻了劳动强度。
    本报太原25日电　山西省武乡县关河水库工地办工厂，为解决目前兴办大中型水利工程中物资缺乏、工具落后、劳力紧张等矛盾提供了一条新途径。
    关河水库地处太行山区漳河上，是漳河三大水库工程之一。这个水库蓄水量一亿多公方，峻工后可使附近的十万多亩旱地变成水地，四万亩沙川变成良田。在水库上建成两座水力发电站后，能供给四百户人家照明用电，以及当地工业和人民公社机械用电，利用水库还能大力发展水产养鱼事业。这项工程对改变害河为利河、提早改变当地山区面貌有很大作用。
    今年春天工程开始时曾遇到一系列困难。工程需要的水泥和炸药，很多得不到供应，还需要大量机电、照明设备。现有工具也很落后，如运土工具只有为数极少的几百辆小平车。水库领导机构大胆发动群众，想办法，出主意，全工地共写出大字报八千多张，提出合理化建议一万二千多件。许多建议都提出不依靠国家，用自力更生办工厂的办法解决困难。工地党委会接受这些意见，决定在工地上办工厂。当时的行动口号是：“向工厂要工具，向工具要劳力，不靠国家，自力更生，兴建十个工厂”。可是在这一新事物面前，大家的看法还不一致。有的人对工地办工厂半信半疑说：“工人没资金，没技术，没材料如何办”。针对这些思想，党委会决定用整风的精神展开大鸣大放大辩论，经过一场思想论战，大家有了比较一致的认识，认为政治挂帅依靠群众就能办成。
    在办工厂过程中，党委会紧紧依靠群众，使许多意料以外的困难问题都迎刃而解。建工具厂时，材料不足，全县召开十四个人民公社协作会议以后，各公社就把久存未用的木材拿出来支援。水泥厂建成后，原料缺乏，不能生产。红旗人民公社自动组织了一个大队送来两万斤石膏，保证了正常生产。在解决技术力量时，党委会采取会啥干啥的办法，在五千多个施工人员中物色到了木匠、铁匠、编织、铁路、电力、水泥等十二种工人近百名，又指派了四百人给他们作学徒。就这样一无所有的工地上，苇子搭成工房、土窑洞用作宿舍，不到十天就建立了水泥、炸药、工具、滚珠、发电、石膏、编织、钢铁等十座工厂。
    各个工地工厂采取了边建、边生产的方法，在建厂的同时，就源源地创造出一百多种新产品，满足水库上的需要。几个月来造出了一万多件工具，使水利工地实现了土炮爆破、高线运土，和远路平地土铁路化、近路缓坡车子化、陡坡木轨自动化、隔沟运土高线化、车子滚珠轴承化、装土倒土自动化，大大减轻了施工人员的劳动强度，缩短了工程时间。原来计划用一万人修建水库，九个月竣工，结果只用四个多月就完工了，节省人工一百多万个。
