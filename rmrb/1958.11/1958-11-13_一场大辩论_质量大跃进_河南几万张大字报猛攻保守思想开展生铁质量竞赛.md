Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 12th: The six million strong iron and steel army of Henan Province is vigorously improving the quality of iron smelting, and launching a campaign to smelt high-quality iron.

In mobilizing the masses to improve the quality of iron, various localities first broke down ideological obstacles such as the belief that "you can't have both quantity and quality" and "native methods cannot produce good iron," and organized the masses to carry out a large-scale airing of views and debate on "Why should we produce high-quality iron?", "Can we produce high-quality iron?" and "How can we produce high-quality iron?". In Anyang County alone, the iron and steel army posted more than 31,000 big-character posters, fiercely attacking various conservative ideas, and submitted more than 11,000 letters of determination to ensure improved quality. At the same time, factories and furnaces also put forward conditions and launched quality competitions.

Now, the province's iron and steel army is focusing on improving quality and launching a hot and lively movement to offer suggestions and ideas. They have put forward tens of thousands of rationalization proposals. In order to improve the quality of iron, many people are working tirelessly to improve furnace types, equipment, and operating techniques, and are generally thickening furnace walls and changing cold air to hot air. In Xinxiang and Luoyang prefectures alone, more than 11,000 hot air furnaces have recently been converted, greatly increasing both output and quality. The First Secretary of the CPC Yancheng County Committee and the Party Secretaries of various townships worked alongside the workers in front of the furnace, and after improving the furnace type and smelting, batching, repairing furnaces, and adding materials techniques in response to furnace problems, all the normally producing indigenous blast furnaces in the county were able to produce gray pig iron with an iron content of 93% to 97%. Lushan County's "August 1st" Iron and Steel Plant adopted the method of one master teaching multiple apprentices and launched competitions. Nearly two-thirds of the workers in the plant have mastered the complete set of techniques, and pig iron production has achieved normalization, high yield, and high quality, and has eliminated sintered iron.

Many places have discovered and promoted the excellent furnace types with high output and good quality created by the masses through mass inspections and evaluations, and abandoned the bad large iron smelting kilns and large earthwork furnaces. The iron and steel army in various places is currently rushing to build small blast furnaces with smooth molten iron flow. The CPC Luoyang Prefectural Committee requested that more than 33,000 such small blast furnaces be built in the entire area in November. In Linru County, more than 18,000 furnace building workers have recently completed more than 4,900 new indigenous blast furnaces.

### 一场大辩论　质量大跃进  河南几万张大字报猛攻保守思想开展生铁质量竞赛

    一场大辩论　质量大跃进
    河南几万张大字报猛攻保守思想开展生铁质量竞赛
    新华社郑州12日电　河南省六百万钢铁大军正在大力提高炼铁质量，开展炼优质铁的运动。
    各地在发动群众提高铁的质量的时候，首先打破那种认为“要多就不能好”、“土法不能出好铁”等各种思想障碍，组织群众开展“为什么要生产优质铁”、“能不能生产优质铁”和“怎样才能生产优质铁”的大鸣大放大辩论。仅安阳县钢铁大军就贴出三万一千多张大字报，猛攻了各种保守思想，并且提出保证提高质量的决心书一万一千多份；同时，厂与厂、炉与炉之间还提出条件，展开质量竞赛。
    现在全省的钢铁大军正以提高质量为中心，掀起热火朝天的献策献计运动。他们提出数以万计的合理化建议。很多人为了提高铁的质量，废寝忘食地在那里改进炉型、设备和操作技术，并且普遍地在加厚炉壁、改冷风为热风，仅新乡、洛阳两专区最近改成的热风炉就有一万一千多座，使产量、质量都有很大提高。中共郾城县委第一书记和各乡党委书记同工人一道在炉前操作，针对炉子毛病改进炉型和冶炼、配料、修炉、添料等技术以后，使全县正常生产的土高炉全部炼出了灰生铁、含铁量达到93％到97％。鲁山县“八一”钢铁厂由于采取一师带多徒的办法，并且开展竞赛，全厂将近三分之二的工人已能掌握全套技术，生铁生产已达到正常化、高产化、优质化，并且消灭了烧结铁。
    不少地方通过群众性的检查评比，及时发现和推广群众创造的产量高、质量好的优秀炉型，废弃那种不好的大炼铁窑和大土方炉。各地钢铁大军目前都在赶建铁水畅流的小高炉。中共洛阳地委要求11月份在全区建设这种小高炉三万三千多座。临汝县一万八千多名建炉大军，最近建成的新土高炉已有四千九百多个。
