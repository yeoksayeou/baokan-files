Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, October 31st. After setting a record of 1,340 tons of steel produced daily on October 20th, Xishui County in the northern mountainous region of Guizhou Province set an even higher record of 5,421 tons of steel produced daily on October 25th.

The main reason for the rapid development of their steelmaking industry is their reliance on the masses. The people of the entire county began building furnaces on October 18th, and by the 19th, 1,185 indigenous furnaces and crucibles were put into production. After setting the first high-yield record on October 20th, they immediately summarized their experience and modified and reorganized the substandard indigenous steelmaking furnaces; many areas also learned from the example of the iron and steel joint enterprises, building the indigenous steelmaking furnaces next to the indigenous iron smelting blast furnaces, which greatly shortened the steel smelting time and saved a lot of fuel.

    贵州鰼水日产钢逾五千吨
    新华社贵阳31日电　贵州北部山区鰼水县在10月20日创造日产钢一千三百四十吨的纪录以后，25日又创造了日产钢五千四百二十一吨的更高纪录。
    他们的炼钢工业所以能迅速发展起来，主要原因是依靠了群众。全县人民从10月18日起开始建炉，到19日就有一千一百八十五个土炉、坩锅等投入生产。他们在20日第一次创造高产纪录后，立即总结经验，把不合规格的土炼钢炉加以修改和整理；许多地区还学习钢铁联合企业的样子，把土炼钢炉建立在土炼铁高炉旁边，使钢的冶炼时间大大缩短，并且节省了许多燃料。
