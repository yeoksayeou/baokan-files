What Do the U.S. Election Results Show?
Excerpts from an Editorial in the American "Worker's Weekly"

Editor's Note: In the U.S. congressional and local elections on November 4, the Republican Party suffered a crushing defeat. Public opinion in various countries believes that the Republican Party's failure reflects the unpopularity of the Eisenhower administration's brink-of-war policy and its reactionary domestic policies. The American "Worker's Weekly" published an editorial on November 9 entitled "A Glimpse at the Elections," which discusses the results and significance of the election. Excerpts are translated and published below:

The results of the November 4 election are of extremely broad and far-reaching significance. Therefore, writing this article on the morning after the vote, we can only talk about some of the major developments, lessons, and their significance...

It must also be remembered that the people's sentiment expressed through elections is greatly distorted under the American election system. The people do not have a party that truly represents their interests. Therefore, they must use what they know best to express their wishes through two capitalist parties...

In a large part of the country dominated by the Southern racist election machine, the vast majority of Black people and a large number of white people are not even qualified or allowed to exercise their right to vote. Thus, there is no free expression and testing of will in the South on the very important and urgent issue of current desegregation.

Nevertheless, certain conclusions are strikingly obvious...

I. The Eisenhower administration's foreign policy and its efforts to make that policy "bipartisan" were rejected. The prominent events that attracted people's attention during the election months were the military intervention in Lebanon and Dulles-Eisenhower's brink-of-war actions in the Taiwan Strait. Americans have clearly seen that spreading American bases and troops to every part of the globe means that this country is destined to forever teeter on the brink of war. There is no doubt that the vast majority of voters were influenced by this issue. If Democrats had generally criticized government policies, as former Senator Herbert Lehman, Senator Morse, and some others did, then the results of the November 4 election would have been even more striking.

II. The election results are a protest against the government's pro-big-business economic policies, and also a protest against the government's hands-off attitude in the face of the most serious economic crisis since the war, the second crisis under Eisenhower's administration. False economic analysis and exaggerated "recovery" statistics cannot deceive voters, especially the millions who remain unemployed. Democratic candidates made a big deal out of this issue.

III. Voters emphatically rejected the Republican Party's number one campaign issue—their calls for "labor racketeering," demands for more restrictions on the labor movement, and their targeting of Walter Reuther as their main target...

IV. The Eisenhower administration's appeasement tactics on civil rights issues did not fundamentally change Black voting patterns in industrial areas.

Based on what is already clear, Black people are most interested in facts. The fact that the President did not lead or take effective steps to implement the Supreme Court's ruling on desegregation had the greatest impact on them.

V. The President's calls against "extremism" within the Democratic Party; the important Republicans who, in alliance with Southern Democrats, launched a movement to pass legislation to abolish or undermine Supreme Court rulings affecting the Smith Act, civil rights, and discrimination against Black people—voters emphatically rejected these actions.

Those candidates who were most prominently labeled as "extremists" were all elected by huge majorities. Not only were every incumbent "extremist" who was thought to be on the verge of defeat re-elected, but many new figures, such as Chester Bowles, who have long been the main targets of the far-right, will also appear in the new Congress.

...The overall sentiment of the voters is against extreme reactionaries.

VI. The election clearly shows that the Eisenhower myth is over. His "modern Republicanism" has lost its luster. Underneath it, as Eisenhower's campaign speeches made perfectly clear, there is nothing but the familiar reactionary, rusty big-business capitalism. People have clearly learned a lot since Eisenhower's coattails brought the "Cadillac Cabinet" into Washington.

But while the Eisenhower myth has faded, the same forces have had some success in creating a new myth, the Rockefeller myth. This is the most important result in the New York election, which is a major area where the Republican Party achieved victory.

Perhaps the most important of Rockefeller's tactics is his "independence" from the Republican Party's national leadership and his feigned liberalism. His avoidance of public appearances with Vice President Nixon, and the absence of Republican national leaders from his campaign were widely publicized in the newspapers, in order to give people the impression that Rockefeller was in some sense "opposed" to the Eisenhower-Nixon regime.

Therefore, people's election of him is by no means an indication that people want him to implement the true policies of his Republican supporters, but rather that people want him to fulfill the many promises he has made, and people must insist that he fulfill those promises.

Rockefeller's cunning purpose in posing in this way is also to attract the strength of the large middle class that is constantly breaking away from the Republican Party across the country.

One of the important reasons for Rockefeller's victory is the poor role of labor in the election. The New York State labor movement has more than two and a half million members, and nowhere in the state has it shown the strength and activity that it was originally expected to show. In many parts of our country, labor political activity has played a lively and active role, whereas in New York State, the opposite is true, despite the active activities of the garment workers' union, the hotel workers' union, and some other unions, which have set some prominent examples.

Finally, the division of the New York State people's movement was further aggravated by the emergence of the newly formed Independent Socialist Party, which divided a large part of the left wing and influenced many people to break away from the entire labor-liberal movement.

The Independent Socialist Party's submission of a full list of candidates for election, joining with the Trotskyists, and narrowing the election campaign to a "socialist" basis, has greatly reduced the role of the left wing. If the election had been limited to a candidate who advocated peace, such as Corliss Lamont, the left wing would have had a greater chance of influencing the election on some issues—especially peace. The weakness of the Independent Socialist Party's candidate lineup, and the considerable number of votes that Lamont did receive, is at least partial evidence that what was originally possible could have happened.

The lessons of the election require serious study and reconsideration within the people and labor movement, and the immediate adoption of some action.

This election once again powerfully shows that the cold-war, Nolan-style foreign policy advocated by the top labor leaders is self-defeating, contrary to the will of the people, and harmful to labor.

The opposition of agricultural workers—the Republican Party's defeats in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa once again strikingly illustrate this opposition—once again powerfully illustrates the need for active unity between workers and peasants.

The election results also give some special lessons to Communists and militant leftists.

Communists can feel proud in many areas; in those areas, their members and supporters actively participated in the election campaign, especially against the right-to-work amendment. Their contribution exceeded the scope of their members' work. This contribution encouraged labor, people of all ethnic groups, and the Black movement in these areas to more actively oppose the main enemies of the people.

The absence of Communist candidate lists in most parts of the country is a serious weakness for the Party and for the entire working class. It is the Communists who most often reveal problems and initiate activities to expose and eliminate the false issues and confusion raised by the electioneers of the old parties, and to make the real issues stand out.

Wherever Communists have candidates (for example, the Harlem district with Benjamin Davis as a candidate), or where they find a way to influence the election issues, the quality of the general election campaign is generally higher.

The election results should be a stimulus to the Communist Party and the entire left wing. The people are clearly opposed to reactionary forces and are striving for peace. They clearly hope to take new steps forward.

### 美国选举结果说明什么？  美国“工人周报”社论摘要

    美国选举结果说明什么？
    美国“工人周报”社论摘要
    编者按　在11月4日的美国国会和地方选举中，美国共和党遭到了惨重的失败。各国舆论认为，共和党的失败，反映了艾森豪威尔政府的战争边缘政策及其国内的反动政策十分不得人心。美国“工人周报”11月9日刊载了一篇题为“选举一瞥”的社论，对这次选举的结果及其意义有所论述，特摘译刊载如下：
    11月4日选举结果是具有极其广泛的重大意义的，所以，在投票以后第二天上午写这篇文章的时候，我们只能谈到某些主要发展、教训和它们的意义……
    还必须记住，通过选举表现出来的人民的情绪，在美国的选举方式下遭到了很大的歪曲。人民没有一个真正代表他们利益的党。因此，他们就要通过两个资本主义政党运用他们所知道的最好的方式来表达他们的愿望……
    在南方种族主义选举机器支配下的这个国家很大一部分地方，绝大部分的黑人和数目很大的白种人甚至于没有资格或不得行使他们的选举权。这样，在南方关于当前取消种族隔离的非常重要的迫切问题上没有意志的自由表现和测验。
    尽管这样，某些结论是极其明显地突出的……
    一、艾森豪威尔政府的外交政策以及它使这种政策具有“两党”性质的努力遭到了拒绝。在进行竞选的几个月中吸引人们注意力的突出事件就是对黎巴嫩进行的军事干涉，以及杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔在台湾海峡采取的战争边缘的行动。美国人已经清楚地看到，把美国基地和军队散布到地球的每一部分去的作法意味着，这个国家注定要永远在战争边缘上摇摇摆摆。毫无疑问，绝大多数选民都受到了这个问题的影响。如果民主党人普遍对政府政策提出批评，像前参议员赫伯特·利曼、参议员莫尔斯和某些别的人所提出的批评一样，那末11月4日选举的结果甚至就会更突出。
    二、选举结果是对政府的亲大企业经济政策的一个抗议，也是对政府在战后最严重的经济危机、艾森豪威尔当政下第二次危机面前采取袖手旁观的态度的一个抗议。虚假的经济分析和夸大的“复苏”统计数字骗不了选民，特别是那些数以百万计的仍然失业的人们。民主党候选人曾在这个问题上大做文章。
    三、选民着重地拒绝了共和党人提出的第一号竞选问题——他们叫嚷“劳工舞弊案”，提出对劳工运动实行更多的限制的要求，并且以华尔特·路德作为他们的主要目标……
    四、艾森豪威尔政府在公民权利问题上所采取的笼络人心的策略，并没有使工业地区黑人的投票情况发生基本变动。
    根据已经很明显的情况，黑种人民最感兴趣的是事实。总统并没有领导或采取有效的步骤执行最高法院关于取消种族隔离的裁决，这一事实对他们产生了最大的影响。
    五、总统叫嚷反对民主党中的“过激主义”；重要的共和党人在同南方民主党人联盟下发动了运动要求通过立法，废除或破坏最高法院作出的影响到史密斯法以及公民权利和歧视黑人的行动的裁决，选民对这些行动着重地予以拒绝。
    那些最突出地被称为“过激分子”的候选人都以巨大的多数票当选。不仅是每一个被认为要失败的在任的“过激分子”都重新当选，而且还有许多像切斯特·鲍尔斯这样一些长期来是极右分子主要攻击对象的新人物也将在新国会中出现。
    ……选民的总的情绪是反对极端反动派。
    六、选举清楚地表明，艾森豪威尔神话已经结束。他的“现代共和主义”已经失去了光泽，在它下面，正如艾森豪威尔竞选演说十分清楚地显示的那样，除了人们熟知的反动生锈的大企业资本主义以外什么也没有。自从艾森豪威尔的衣摆把“卡迪拉克内阁”带进华盛顿以来，人们显然已经学到了许多东西。
    但是，虽然艾森豪威尔神话消逝了，但是同样的势力已经在制造新的神话方面取得了一些成功，这就是洛克菲勒神话。这是纽约选举中最重要的结果，纽约是共和党取得胜利的一个重要地区。
    洛克菲勒的策略中也许最重要的是他对于共和党全国领导的“独立性”以及他假装的自由主义。他避免同副总统尼克松一起公开露面，以及他的竞选运动中没有共和党全国领袖都被报纸大肆宣传，为的是要使人们得到这么个印象：洛克菲勒在某种意义上是“反对”艾森豪威尔—尼克松式的政权的。
    因此，人们选他决不是表明人们要求他实行他的共和党支持者的真正政策，而是表明人们要他履行他许下的许多诺言，而且人们一定坚持要他履行这些诺言。
    洛克菲勒装出这种姿态的狡猾目的也是要吸引全国的不断在脱离共和党的大批中产阶级的力量。
    洛克菲勒胜利的重要原因之一是劳工在选举中作用很差。纽约州劳工运动有二百五十多万名会员，在这个州，无论何处都没有显示出接近原来期望它显示的力量和活动。在我国的许多地方，劳工政治活动都起了生气蓬勃的、积极的作用，而在纽约州，情况正相反，尽管派货工会、旅馆业工会和其他一些工会的积极活动树立了一些突出的榜样。
    最后，纽约州人民运动的分裂，由于新成立的独立社会党的出现而更加恶化，独立社会党分去了很大一部分左派，并且影响许多人脱离了整个的劳工自由运动。
    独立社会党提出参加竞选的全部候选人名单，联合托派，并且把竞选运动缩小到“社会主义”的基础上，这就使得左派的作用大大减少了。如果当时参加竞选的限于一个拥护和平的候选人，如柯利斯·拉蒙特，左派本会在一些问题上——尤其是和平——有更大的可能性影响选举的。独立社会党的候选人名单阵容之弱，以及拉蒙特的确得到的颇多的票数，至少是部分的证据，证明原来有可能出现的情况。
    选举的教训要求在人民和劳工运动内部进行认真的研究和重新考虑以及立即采取某种行动。
    这次选举又一次有力地表明，劳工的最高领导遵循的主张冷战的诺兰式的外交政策是自取灭亡的，是违背人民的意愿并且对劳工有害的。
    农业工人的反对——共和党人在明尼苏达、威斯康星和衣阿华的挫败再次引人注目地说明了这种反对——再次有力地说明工人和农民有必要进行积极的联合。
    选举结果也给了共产党人和富有战斗性的左派一些特殊的教训。
    共产党人能够在许多地区感到自豪；在那些地区，他们的成员和支持者积极参加了竞选运动，特别是反对工作权利修正案。他们的贡献超过了他们的成员的工作的范围。这种贡献鼓舞了这些地区的劳工、各族人民和黑人运动，使他们更积极地反对人民的主要敌人。
    全国大多数地方都没有共产党候选人名单，这对于党、对于整个工人阶级来说是一个严重的弱点。正是共产党人最经常地揭示问题和发起活动来揭穿和消除老党派竞选人员提出的虚伪问题和混乱，使真正的问题变得突出起来。
    凡是共产党人有候选人的地方（例如提出本杰明·戴维斯作候选人的哈莱姆区）或者他们找到影响竞选问题的办法的地方，一般竞选活动的质量就高一些。
    竞选结果应当是对共产党和整个左派的一种刺激力量。人民显然在反对反动势力和争取和平。他们显然希望采取新的步骤向前迈进。
