Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 25th: According to a report by the Japanese shortwave radio on the 24th, the Kishida Nobusuke government, in the Japan-U.S. negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty," has secretly agreed to include clauses in the "Japan-U.S. Joint Defense Treaty" it will sign with the United States that would drag Japan into the U.S.'s aggressive wars in the Far East.

The radio station, citing sources from the Kishida Nobusuke government, said: "Regarding the central issue in the Japan-U.S. (revision of the 'Security Treaty') negotiations—the area of operation of U.S. forces stationed in Japan—Japan and the U.S. seem to have reached a consensus that it will include the Far East region, including the Japanese mainland, Okinawa, Ogasawara, South Korea, and Taiwan."

According to a recent disclosure in the "Japan Economic News," the draft text of the proposed "Japan-U.S. Joint Defense Treaty" also stipulated that "Japan and the United States declare that (both countries) consider an armed attack on Japan proper and its territories, as well as on the United States responsible for defending Japan, as an action endangering the peace and security of their own countries, and will take action to deal with the common danger in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the constitution." Thus, the essence of the Kishida Nobusuke government's agreement that U.S. forces stationed in Japan can take action in the above-mentioned vast Far East region is already clear: In addition to explicitly affirming that the U.S. can use Japan as a base for launching aggressive wars in the vast Far East region, the Kishida Nobusuke government also agrees that Japan will participate in the U.S.'s military adventures against China and other Far Eastern countries.

The radio station also revealed that although Kishida Nobusuke has secretly promised to hitch Japan to the American war chariot, he is doing his utmost to conceal his betrayal of Japanese national interests and to undertake dangerous obligations to the United States in a roundabout way at home, simply out of concern for the strong opposition of the Japanese people. The radio station said: "The United States initially seemed to accept the intention of the U.S. Congress and intended to stipulate the area in which U.S. troops would take action as the Western Pacific, as in the U.S.-Chiang treaty. However, the Japanese side believes that if it accepts the U.S. request intact, it may give the Japanese people the impression that the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' has been revised for the worse. Therefore, Kishida Nobusuke declared in the Diet that the Western Pacific will not be regarded as the applicable area of the Security Treaty."

According to Kyodo News, the Kishida Nobusuke government held a cabinet meeting today to discuss the issue of revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" again. At this cabinet meeting, Foreign Minister Fujiyama Aiichiro of the Kishida Nobusuke government, worried that the Japanese people had already seen through the inside story of the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," said: "It seems that some people feel that due to the revision of the treaty, (Japan) may assume more obligations than under the current treaty." He said: "There is also a saying that revising the Security Treaty will increase the danger of (Japan) being dragged into war." Awed by the powerful strength shown by the Japanese people in the recent struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," Fujiyama tried his best to cover up the conspiracy of the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet, saying that he did not want to do so. On the 23rd, Fujiyama also made a similar deceptive propaganda to reporters in Kyoto, saying that he wanted to "revise" the current Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," not to "revise it for the worse."

Even Takeo Miki, the Director-General of the Economic Planning Agency of the Kishida Nobusuke government, has doubts about Kishida Nobusuke's attempt to participate in the U.S.'s aggressive plans in the Far East as soon as possible by concluding the "Japan-U.S. Joint Defense Treaty," regardless of everything. Miki asked to speak on the issue of revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" at today's cabinet meeting. He believes that "the defense area can be the current scope." He said: "The current Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' should not be revised to strengthen military cooperation between Japan and the United States, nor should the defense area be expanded; the incomplete parts of the current treaty and the parts that do not conform to national sentiment should be clarified." Kyodo News said that people believe that Miki's speech "contains the idea that it is not good to include Okinawa and Ogasawara in the joint defense area."

No matter how clever the Kishida Nobusuke group's sleight of hand in revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is, it will definitely not escape the opposition of the Japanese people. Asahi Broadcasting Corporation pointed out in a commentary on the 24th: "For the Liberal Democratic Party, the issue of revising the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty will be a bigger political issue than the revision of the 'Police Duties Execution Law.'"

    岸政府死要当美国侵略帮凶
    在谈判中已偷偷同意把日本拴上美国战车
    但是在国内竭力掩饰事实真相以欺骗人民
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：据日本短波电台24日透露，岸信介政府在日美关于修改“安全条约”的谈判中，已经偷偷摸摸地同意在它将同美国签订的“日美共同防御条约”中规定把日本拖进美国在远东发动的侵略战争的条款。
    这家电台援引岸信介政府方面透露的消息说：“关于日美（修改‘安全条约’的）谈判的中心问题——驻日美军的行动区域，日美双方似已取得一致的意见，它将是包括日本本土、冲绳、小笠原、南朝鲜和台湾在内的远东地区。”
    据“日本经济新闻”最近透露，拟议中的这项“日美共同防御条约”的草约本文还曾经规定，“日美两国宣布，（两国）认为对日本本部及其领域以及对负责保卫着日本的美国进行的武装进攻，都是危及本国的和平和安全的行动，并且将根据宪法规定的程序，为了对付共同的危险而采取行动。”这样，岸信介政府同意驻日美军可以在上述广大的远东地区采取行动的做法的实质已经昭然若揭：岸信介政府除了明确肯定美国可以把日本作为它在远东广大地区发动侵略战争的基地以外，还同意日本将参与美国对中国和其它远东国家的军事冒险。
    这家电台还透露，岸信介虽然已经在暗地里承诺把日本拴在美国的战车上，而在国内却极力掩盖他的出卖日本民族利益的勾当和采取拐弯抹角的方式向美国承担危险的义务，只是出于担心日本人民的强烈反对。电台说：“美国方面在最初似乎接受了美国国会的意图，打算同美蒋条约一样，把美国军队采取行动的区域规定为西太平洋。但是，日本方面认为，如果原封不动地接受美国的要求，恐怕给日本国民一种日美‘安全条约’被改坏了的印象。因此，岸信介在国会上宣称，不把西太平洋作为安全条约的适用区域。”
    据共同社报道，岸信介政府今天举行了内阁会议，再次讨论了关于修改日美“安全条约”的问题。在这次内阁会议上，岸信介政府的外务相藤山爱一郎担心日本人民已经看穿了修改日美“安全条约”的内幕，他说：“好像有一部分人觉得，由于修改条约，（日本）可能会承担比现行条约更多的义务。”他说：“还有一种说法是，修改安全条约将会增大（日本）被卷入战争的危险。”慑于日本人民在最近反对修改“警察官职务执行法”的斗争中所表现出的强大力量，藤山竭力为岸信介内阁的阴谋打掩护，说他不想这样做。藤山在23日还在京都对记者们作了一通类似的欺骗宣传，说他是要“修正”现行的日美“安全条约”，而不是要“改坏”它。
    对于岸信介不顾一切地企图通过缔结“日美共同防御条约”，以便尽快参与美国在远东的侵略计划的做法，甚至岸信介政府的经济企划厅长官三木武夫也有疑虑。三木在今天的内阁会议上要求就修改日美“安全条约”的问题发言。他认为，“防御地区照现在的范围就可以了。”他说：“修改现行的日美‘安全条约’，既不要加强日本同美国的军事合作，也不要扩大防御地区；应该弄清现行条约中的不完备的地方和不符合国民感情的地方”。共同社说，人们认为，三木的发言“包含有这样一种想法：把冲绳和小笠原包括到共同防御地区中去是不好的。”
    岸信介集团在修改日美“安全条约”中玩弄的偷天换日的手法不管多么巧妙，肯定逃不过日本人民的反对。朝日广播电台24日在评论中曾经指出：“对于自由民主党来说，修改日美安全条约的问题，将是比修改‘警察官职务执行法’还要大的政治问题。”
