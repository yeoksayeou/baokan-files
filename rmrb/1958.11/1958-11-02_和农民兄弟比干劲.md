Competing with Farmer Brothers in Enthusiasm
Shanghai State-owned Cotton No. 2 Factory, Yi Shijuan Group

    When Chairman Mao inspected the rural areas of Anhui, he instructed: "Since meals can be free, clothing can also be free in the future." Free meals depend on the farmer brothers' increased grain production; in the future, the realization of free clothing will depend not only on the increased production of cotton, wool, hemp, and silk by the farmers and herdsmen, but also on our textile workers spinning and weaving more and faster. This is the glorious task of our textile workers. This year, farmer brothers produced more than 70 million dan of cotton, double that of last year. In the future, it will depend on how we textile workers "digest" this cotton.
    At present, a good way for our textile factories to increase production is to promote high speed, high yield, high quality, and high technology. Under the leadership of the Party, our group has achieved some success in this regard. The speed of the roving frame rollers of 32-count yarn spinning machines has increased from 220 revolutions per minute at the beginning of this year to 285 revolutions per minute. The unit output (i.e., the output per thousand spindles per hour) has increased from 17 kilograms to 20.5 kilograms to 21 kilograms; the speed of 21-count yarn has increased from 282 revolutions to over 400 revolutions, and the unit output has increased by 9 kilograms.
    The speed of our factory's machines has always been relatively high. Since 1950, we have been continuously increasing the speed and increasing production. This year's unprecedented bumper cotton harvest has led to a greater increase in machine speed in our factory than in any previous year, and we have encountered the most difficulties. The biggest difficulty is that after the speed was suddenly increased, the end breakage jumped from 40-50 ends per thousand spindles per hour to 400-500 ends. Sometimes the entire machine would break. The workshop was filled with flying cotton, the spindle bases were hot, the bobbins were jumping… Production efficiency was very low, and the order was chaotic. At this time, some cadres and workers in the workshop wavered in their confidence. Some engineers believed that the factory's speed had always been very high, and further acceleration would be too much to handle; others believed that although the speed was faster, the efficiency had not increased, and this did not conform to the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical. Many people proposed slowing down the speed and then accelerating after finding a solution, which was actually rejecting high speed.
    After discussion, our group believed that the rural areas are in a great leap forward, and the farmers have grown more than 70 million dan of cotton. If it is not spun into yarn and woven into cloth, will it be left to rot in the warehouse? We were determined to compete with the farmer brothers in enthusiasm; no matter how much cotton the farmers send, we will "eat" it all. Everyone also recalled that in the winter of 1954, when the speed was increased from 170 revolutions to 270 revolutions, there were also 600-700 end breakages, but they were gradually reduced to 40-50 ends. Wasn't that what we did? It can be seen that it is up to people. As long as we muster our energy and try our best to overcome difficulties, we will definitely win the battle. Therefore, our group was the first to post a big-character poster in the workshop: "Only acceleration is allowed, no deceleration is allowed. Whoever retreats, we will fight him!"
    At that time, our group members went to the workshop three quarters of an hour to an hour early every day to do cleaning work in advance, so that the doffers had more time to catch the broken ends. As soon as the doffers finished doffing, they went to the machines to help the spinners. As soon as the auxiliary workers were free, they poured tea and water for the spinners and cleaned the machine surfaces and the floor. Everyone was united, regardless of each other, and helped wherever the work was difficult. Comrades from the roving frame workshop also came to support us continuously. Our entire group dealt with the end breakage like a fire brigade fighting a fire.
    However, after working for a few days, many people had sore backs and aching legs. Some people were so tired after work that they lay in bed and couldn't get up. Everyone felt that it was not enough to rely on enthusiasm alone; it was necessary to innovate technology and change operating methods. How to innovate? Where do the methods come from? Some people suggested asking the leaders for solutions. Most people disagreed. They said: Hao Jianxiu is also a young female worker, and she was able to create the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method." Why can't we? Didn't we also study and improve seven items in the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in the previous two months? Therefore, everyone decided: everyone should take action and work hard for two days to summarize a set of work methods suitable for high-speed production. On those two nights, the group members were busy producing on the machines while conducting various operational experiments. Ni Yuzhen and Zhou Huifang were the first to find the trick to avoid catching empty spindles. Some comrades also changed the way they did cleaning work in the past, following the routine, which also greatly reduced the end breakage. Some comrades also went to work early and went to other shifts to observe the operations. After work in the morning, although everyone was tired, they were reluctant to go home, and then they held two or three hours of meetings to summarize operating experience. In this way, after two days, a new work method was produced, and our technical level was also improved. Later, the factory summarized a more complete set of fast operation methods based on our summary. More than a week later, the end breakage was reduced from 400-500 ends to more than 100 ends, and the chaotic phenomenon basically stopped.
    The next difficulty encountered was that although the end breakage was reduced, the production efficiency was not improved, and the output could not rise as much as the speed. One or twenty spindles on a machine often malfunctioned and were idling there, and the doffers were anxious, but the assistant foreman couldn't repair them in time. The workshop Party branch and the assistant foreman Yi Shijuan proposed that everyone should learn to repair the machines and improve the operating efficiency. Some female workers were still a little superstitious at first, saying: We fine yarn female workers have always only known how to catch the ends, not how to repair machines. Now there are so many end breakages, and we are so busy catching the ends, where do we have time to learn how to repair machines? However, everyone found that Ni Yuzhen's machines had very few empty spindles. It turned out that she had learned to repair the small problems on the machines herself. "If Ni Yuzhen can repair them, why can't we?" So, everyone decided: work hard for a week, everyone should learn how to repair machines, and strive to be multi-skilled. At the beginning, everyone didn't know how to repair them, so they studied each other and asked the assistant foreman and the maintenance master for advice. If they couldn't repair it once, they would repair it again. Now, everyone in our group can repair small problems on the machines.
    In early September, the factory launched a red flag competition of "learning from skilled workers, catching up with skilled workers, and surpassing skilled workers." In the competition, everyone compared: who has the highest technology? Whose end breakage is less? Whose output is higher? Whose empty spindles and white waste are less? Those with good results had red flags inserted on their machines. After the efforts of the previous stage, all the machines in our group were gloriously flagged, and the entire work area was the first in the factory to release a high-yield "satellite."
    Of course, our achievements are still not great, and there is still a distance from the requirement to "digest" all 70 million dan of cotton. Especially after the people's commune, the farmers are so enthusiastic, 70 million dan this year, and it may be 100 million dan next year. Our textile workers must compete with the farmer brothers in enthusiasm, support each other, compete with each other, leap forward again and again, and let the happy days of "free meals and free clothing" pointed out to us by Chairman Mao arrive soon!

    和农民兄弟比干劲
    上海国棉二厂　裔式娟小组
    毛主席视察安徽农村的时候指示说：“既然吃饭可以不要钱，将来穿衣服也就可以不要钱了。”吃饭不要钱，靠农民兄弟增产粮食；将来实行穿衣不要钱，除了靠农、牧民兄弟增产棉、毛、麻、丝以外，就要靠我们纺织工人多纺快织了。这是我们纺织工人的光荣任务。今年，农民兄弟生产了七千多万担棉花，比去年翻了一番。今后，就看我们纺织工人如何“消化”这些棉花了。
    当前，我们纺织厂增产的好办法，是推行高速度，高产量，高质量，高技术。我们小组在党的领导下，在这方面取得了一些成绩。三十二支纱细纱机的罗拉每分钟速度从今年年初的二百二十转提高到二百八十五转，单位产量（即每千只锭子一小时的产量）从十七公斤提高到二十点五公斤到二十一公斤；二十一支纱的速度从二百八十二转提高到四百转以上，单位产量提高了九公斤。
    我们厂的车速向来是比较高的，从1950年开始，就不断地提高车速，增加生产。今年的棉花空前丰收，我们厂提高车速的幅度比以往任何一年都大，遇到的困难也最多。最大的困难是车速骤然加快以后，断头一下子从每千锭一小时内断四、五十根跳到四、五百根。有的时候整台车子全部断光。车间里飞花扑面，锭脚发热，筒管跳动……生产效率很低，秩序很乱。这时候，车间里有些干部和工人信心动摇了。有的工程师认为：厂里车速历来已经很高，再加快车子会吃不消；有的人认为：速度虽然快了，但是效率没有提高，这样做不符合多快好省的方针。很多人提出要放慢车速，想出办法以后再加快，实际上是不要高速度。
    我们小组讨论以后认为：农村大跃进，农民种出了七千多万担棉花，不纺成纱、织成布，难道让它堆在仓库里烂掉？我们下了决心，要和农民兄弟比干劲；农民送来多少棉花，我们就“吃”掉多少。大家还回忆起1954年冬天，车速从一百七十转加到二百七十转的时候，断头也有六、七百根，后来终于逐步减少到四、五十根，这不是我们干出来的吗？可见，事在人为，只要我们鼓足干劲，千方百计克服困难，就一定能打胜仗。因此，我们小组在车间里第一个贴出了大字报：“只准加速，不准退速，谁要后退，就跟他斗争！”
    当时，我们小组的同志们每天都提前三刻钟到一小时进车间，事先做好清洁工作，让挡车工有更多的时间抢接头。落纱工一落完纱就上车帮助挡车工。辅助工一有空就给挡车工倒茶送水，把车面地面打扫清爽。大家团结一致，不分彼此，哪里工作难做，就去哪里帮忙。前纺车间的同志也不断前来支援我们。我们整个小组像救火队救火那样，来对付断头。
    可是，干了几天以后，很多人腰酸背痛，有的人下了班就疲倦得躺在床上起不来。大家感到光凭干劲还不行，必须要革新技术，改变操作方法。如何革新？办法哪里来？有人提出要领导想办法。大多数人都不同意。她们说：郝建秀也是一个年轻的女工，她能够创造出“郝建秀工作法”，我们为什么不能？我们前两个月不是也研究改进了郝建秀工作法中的七个项目吗？因此，大家决定：全体动手，苦干两天，总结出一套适合高速生产的工作方法。那两天夜里，小组同志们一面在车上紧张生产，一面进行各种操作试验。倪玉珍和周惠芳最先找到了不接空头的窍门。有的同志改变过去按部就班做清洁工作的方式，也使断头大大减少。有的同志还提早上班，到别班车上去观摩操作。早上放工以后，大家虽然累，也都不肯回家，接着还开两三小时的会，总结操作经验。就这样，两天以后，新的工作法产生了，我们的技术水平也提高了。以后，厂里又在我们总结的基础上，总结出一套比较完整的快速操作法。一个多星期以后，断头从四、五百根减少到一百多根，混乱的现象基本停止了。
    接着遇到的另一个困难，是断头减少了，生产效率却提不高，产量还不能和速度一样往上升。一台车子经常有一、二十只锭子出毛病，在那里空运转，挡车工干着急，副工长来不及修理。车间党支部和副工长裔式娟就提出来：大家学会修车子，提高运转效率。有的女工开始还有些迷信，说：我们细纱女工，从来是只会接头，不会修机。现在断头这么多，接头这样忙，哪有时间学修机器？可是，大家发现倪玉珍挡的车子空锭很少。原来她已经学会自己修理车上的小毛病了。“倪玉珍能修，我们为什么不能？”于是，大家决定：苦干一星期，人人学会修机器，争取做多面手。开始时，大家不会修，就互相研究，向副工长、保全老师傅请教。一次修不好，再修一次。现在，我们小组每个人都会修机器上的小毛病了。
    9月初，厂里开展了“学能手，赶能手，超能手”的红旗竞赛。在竞赛中，大家比：谁的技术高？谁的断头少？谁的产量高？谁的空锭、白花少？成绩好的就在她车上插上红旗。我们小组经过前一阶段的努力，全部车子都光荣地插上了红旗，全工区在厂里第一个放出了高产“卫星”。
    当然啦，我们的成绩还不大，离开把七千万担棉花都“消化”掉的要求还有一段距离。特别是人民公社化以后，农民的干劲那么大，今年七千万担，明年就可能上亿担。我们纺织工人一定要和农民兄弟比干劲，互相支援，互相竞赛，跃进再跃进，让毛主席指给我们的“吃饭不要钱，穿衣不要钱”的幸福日子早日到来！
