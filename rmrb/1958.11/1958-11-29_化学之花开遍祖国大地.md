Chemical Flowers Bloom All Over the Motherland
By Our Correspondent Meng Fan

"Magician"

Chemical industry is like magic; it can turn sea salt and coal into beautiful clothing, turn sweet potatoes and corn cobs into tough rubber and plastic, combine stones, coal, water, and air into chemical fertilizers, and even turn things people consider useless garbage into various useful things....

No! Our people have long understood the secrets of the chemical industry. From the chemical industry pavilion of the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition, we know that as early as the Qin and Han dynasties more than two thousand years ago, people understood the principle of "metal displacement," as it is called in modern chemistry, and this principle was already put into practice by the Tang Dynasty and the Five Dynasties. Today, China's chemical industry technology is developing rapidly. It not only produces large quantities of fertilizers, acids, alkalis, medicines, paints, and dyes, but also begins to master new technological achievements such as synthetic rubber, plastics, and synthetic fibers.

Grain and Fertilizer

Entering the chemical industry pavilion, a tall bouquet-shaped display stand appears before us. The bottom layer of the display stand is filled with various white granular fertilizers, and the upper layer is covered with plump rice grains, corn, and vegetables. The saying "Grain prospers with fertilizer, a family's prosperity depends on food." hanging on both sides of the display stand reveals its meaning: fertilizer is the magic weapon for increasing grain production. One kilogram of nitrogen fertilizer can increase grain production by 3.6 kilograms or cotton by about 1 kilogram; one kilogram of phosphate fertilizer can increase rice production by 1.5 kilograms or cotton by 0.5 kilograms. Compared with natural fertilizers, the fertilizer effect of one kilogram of nitrogen fertilizer can be equivalent to three kilograms of bean cake and thirty to forty kilograms of human manure.

Near the display stand, various chemical fertilizer samples are on display. Among them are ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, and calcium phosphate produced by modern large-scale enterprises, as well as native fluorine fertilizer and native phosphate fertilizer produced by small county and township factories. On a painting showing rows of factory buildings and mountains of fertilizer piled up, a rapidly rising red line tells us that in 1949, China could only produce more than 20,000 tons of chemical fertilizer, but by 1957, it could produce more than 800,000 tons. During the First Five-Year Plan period, if all the chemical fertilizer produced nationwide was used for grain fields, it could increase grain production by 17.6 billion kilograms, and if used for cotton fields, it could increase cotton production by 50.7 million dan.

We stood in front of an electric map and saw red lights marking fertilizer resources all over the country. The boundless phosphate mines, the extremely rich reserves of coking coal and anthracite coal, and the large amount of natural gas are all waiting for people to develop and utilize. Even more encouraging are the models showing farmers in various places breaking superstitions and running small-scale native fertilizer plants on a large scale. Their common characteristics are that they use local materials, have simple methods, and bloom everywhere. According to incomplete statistics from fifteen provinces and cities including Hebei and Zhejiang, nearly two million native fertilizer plants have been built, producing more than 40 million tons of native fertilizer. Fish, shellfish, algae, and seawater from the sea, weathered rock, potassium feldspar, and apatite from the mountains, peat and alkaline soil from the plains, and slag from industrial and mining areas are all good raw materials for manufacturing fertilizer. The models exhibited in the chemical industry pavilion have all been tried out in various places and have achieved remarkable results. The ammonium sulfate factory run by the masses in Fengjie County, Sichuan Province, only needs a few wooden buckets and iron pots to extract 35 kilograms of ammonium sulfate from 100 kilograms of sulfur residue. A person who does not understand technology at all can learn to operate it in six or seven days.

Compared with the world's developed countries in the chemical industry, China's current fertilizer production is relatively low, but seeing everything in the chemical industry pavilion, people believe that it will not be long before China's fertilizer production will be at the forefront of the world.

Plastic World

Saves steel, rivals hardware;
Good insulation, light and ingenious;
Not afraid of acid, not afraid of alkali, strong and durable;
Crushed wood becomes material, good quality and low price.

This is a visitor's praise for plastic. He is not exaggerating at all. Plastics do have these excellent properties.

The plastic products for agriculture, industry, transportation, and light industry displayed in the chemical industry pavilion bring us into a moving plastic world. The first thing that catches our eye is a model of a greenhouse. Its surroundings and roof are all made of transparent film. The narrator tells us that this film can transmit ultraviolet rays, is warmer than a glass shed, and is more suitable for vegetable growth. Because plastic is wear-resistant and does not burn, it is especially suitable for the mining industry. Various bearings and silent gears, automobile steering wheels, etc., made of plastic have the characteristics of being light, wear-resistant, and rust-free compared to metal. A plastic room carefully arranged by the staff of the pavilion makes people indulge in the enjoyment of beauty. The floor, bed frame, chair frame, and chair surface of this room are all made of polyvinyl chloride. The curtains and tablecloths are made of film. The cabinets made of wooden blocks are the work of amino resin. The hair combs, cosmetic boxes, toys, table lamps, telephone sets, and radio shells displayed on the cabinet, and the photo frames and mirror frames hanging on the wall are almost all celluloid products.

Plastic is an industry that is both ancient and young. Our ancestors used clay to make various ceramic utensils thousands of years ago, and clay is a plastic material. Similarly, glass is also a plastic material. After being melted at high temperature, it can be made into various utensils by blow molding. However, the plastics that people are talking about now specifically refer to organic materials synthesized by chemical methods. Its development has been in the last twenty years, especially after World War II. In 1939, the total output of plastic in the world was only 350,000 tons. After World War II, it doubled every few years. A chart in the chemical industry pavilion clearly reveals the reasons for the rapid development of plastics. One ton of phenolic cloth can replace five tons of bronze, one ton of polyvinyl chloride hard pipe can replace three tons of iron pipe, one ton of artificial leather can replace two hundred pieces of cowhide... Before liberation, China's plastic industry was almost blank. Now, phenolic plastics, ethylene plastics, organic glass, etc. have been produced; polyethylene, organic silicon, epoxy resin, ion exchange resin, and polytetrafluoroethylene, which is known as the king of plastics, have been successfully tested, and some have begun to be put into intermediate test production.

Elastic Substance

Before people knew that adding sulfur to rubber could change its properties, the application of rubber products was greatly limited. When the weather was slightly cold, it became very hard and easy to break; when the weather was hot, it became soft and sticky. In the 1840s, people discovered that adding sulfur to rubber eliminated these shortcomings and turned it into a soft, elastic, airtight, and waterproof substance, making it a good raw material for manufacturing tires. Therefore, until now, the output and production technology of tires are still a measure of the level of the rubber industry.

China's rubber industry has a history of 39 years, starting with the establishment of the first small factory in Guangzhou in 1919. In old China, the rubber industry developed very slowly, and most rubber products were foreign goods. Since liberation, the rubber industry has developed rapidly. Taking tire production as an example, it increased 33 times in 1957 compared with 1949, and is expected to increase 63 times in 1958 compared with 1949.

The dozens of different specifications of tires exhibited in the chemical industry pavilion show that China can not only manufacture aircraft, automobile, and tractor tires, but also that its manufacturing technology has advanced to the world's advanced level. A large tire with a diameter of 1.7 meters is used on trucks with a load of 20 tons, and each tire has a load capacity of 8 tons. Two or three years ago, people had only heard of the name of tubeless tires, but now China has manufactured them in large quantities. Steel cord tires, cordless tires, and latex tires, which are known as the latest technological achievements in tires, have also been manufactured by Chinese workers in this year's Great Leap Forward. The increase in the mileage of various tires is also very significant. Now, general truck tires can reach more than 30,000 kilometers, urban bus tires can reach 40,000 kilometers, and the highest can reach 180,000 kilometers.

    化学之花开遍祖国大地
    本报记者　孟帆
    “魔术家”
    化学工业像魔术一样，它能把海盐、煤炭变成美丽的衣料，把红薯、玉米芯变成坚韧的橡胶和塑料，使石头、煤、水和空气结合成为化学肥料，连人们认为无用的垃圾，在它手下都可以重新做成各种有用的东西……。
    不！我国人民群众早已洞悉了化学工业的秘密。从全国工业交通展览会的化工馆，我们知道远在两千多年前的秦汉时代，就认识了近代化学所说的“金属换置作用”的原理，到唐朝和五代这原理已经实践了。今天，我国化学工业技术更是突飞猛进，不仅大量制造了化肥、酸碱、医药、油漆和染料，而且开始掌握了合成橡胶、塑料、合成纤维等新的技术成就。
    粮食和化肥
    进入化工馆，一个高大的花束形陈列台呈现在我们眼前。陈列台的底层放置着各种洁白的颗粒肥料，上层布满了肥硕的稻粒、玉米和蔬菜。悬挂在陈列台两侧的“粮食一枝花、全靠肥当家”一语，道破了它的含义：肥料是增产粮食的法宝。一斤氮肥可以增产粮食三点六斤或棉花一斤左右；一斤磷肥可以增产稻谷一斤半或棉花半斤。同天然肥料比较，一斤氮肥的肥效可以抵上三斤豆饼和三十斤到四十斤人粪尿。
    陈列台附近，展出了各种各样的化学肥料样品。其中有现代化大型企业生产的硫酸铵、硝酸铵和磷酸钙，有县乡小工厂生产的土氟肥和土磷肥。在一幅厂房栉比相连、化肥堆积似山的画版上，一支急剧上升的红线告诉我们：1949年我国只能生产化肥二万多吨，到1957年已经能生产八十多万吨。在第一个五年计划期间，全国生产的化肥如全部用于粮田，可增产粮食一百七十六亿斤，用于棉田，可增产棉花五千零七十万担。
    我们伫立在一张电动地图前，看到标明化肥资源的红灯遍及祖国各地。那漫无边际的磷矿，蕴藏量极为丰富的炼焦煤和无烟煤，大量的天然气体，都有待于人们去开发、利用。更加令人振奋的是那些表明各地农民破除迷信，大办小型土化肥厂的模型。它们的共同特点是就地取材、办法简单、遍地开花。据河北、浙江等十五个省市的不完全统计，已经建成的土化肥厂近二百万个，生产出四千多万吨土化肥。海里的鱼、贝、藻和海水，山上的风化石、钾长石和磷灰石，平原的泥炭和碱土以及工矿区的矿渣，都是制造化肥的好原料。化工馆展出的模型，都是经过各地试办、成效卓著的。四川省奉节县群众办的硫酸铵工厂，只需要几个木桶和铁锅，就能从一百斤硫磺脚渣中提取三十五斤硫酸铵。一个根本不懂技术的人在六、七天内就可以学会操作。
    同世界上化学工业发达的国家比较，我国目前化肥的产量是比较低的，可是看到化工馆内的一切，人们相信：用不了多久，我国化肥的生产就会走上世界各国的前列。
    塑料世界
    省钢材，赛五金；
    绝缘好，轻又巧；
    不怕酸，不怕碱，坚固耐用；
    碎木成材，物美价廉。
    这是一位参观者对塑料的歌颂。他丝毫也没有夸张，塑料确有这些优异的性能。
    化工馆陈列的农业、工业、交通运输和轻工业等塑料制品，把我们带进了一个动人的塑料世界。最先映入眼帘的是一个温室的模型。它的四周围和顶棚，都是用透明的薄膜制成的。讲解员告诉我们：这种薄膜可以透过紫外线，比玻璃棚还暖和，更适宜于蔬菜的生长。由于塑料耐磨，又不会燃烧，特别适用于采矿工业。用塑料制造的各种轴承和无声齿轮，汽车的方向盘等，比金属具有体轻、耐磨、不生锈等特性。馆内工作人员精心布置的一个塑料房间，更使人们沉湎在美的享受中。这个房间的地板、床架、椅架和椅面都是用聚氯乙烯制成的。窗帘和桌布的原料是薄膜。木块拼成的柜橱是氨基树脂的功劳。柜上陈列的发梳、化妆品盒、玩具、台灯、电话机和收音机壳，墙上挂着的照片框、镜框，几乎都是赛璐珞制品。
    塑料是又古老、又年轻的工业。我们的祖先早在几千年前就用粘土制造各种陶瓷器皿了，而粘土就是可塑性的塑料。同样，玻璃也是一种塑料，它经过高温溶化，可用吹塑的办法制成各种用具。但是，现在人们所说的塑料，是专指用化学方法合成的有机材料。它的发展是近二十年，特别是第二次世界大战以后的事情。1939年全世界塑料的总产量只有三十五万吨。第二次世界大战后每隔几年就增加一倍。化工馆内一张图表清楚地揭示了塑料迅速发展的原因。一吨酚醛布可以代替五吨青铜，一吨聚氯乙烯硬管可以代替三吨铁管，一吨人造革可以代替二百张牛皮……解放前我国塑料工业几乎是空白，现在酚醛塑料、乙烯塑料、有机玻璃等都已经生产；聚乙烯、有机硅、环氧树脂、离子交换树脂以及被称为塑料之王的聚四氧乙烯等，有的已经试验成功，有的开始投入中间试验生产了。
    弹性物质
    当人们还不懂得给胶加硫，可以改变它的性质之前，橡胶制品的应用受到很大限制。天气稍冷，它变得很硬，容易折断；天气一热，它又变得又软又粘。十九世纪四十年代，人们发现在橡胶里加进硫磺，就摆脱了这些缺点，变成柔软、有弹性，不透气、不透水的物质，成为制造轮胎的好原料。因此，直到现在，轮胎的产量和生产技术，还是衡量橡胶工业水平的标志。
    从1919年在广州建立第一个小型工厂开始，我国橡胶工业已有三十九年的历史。旧中国时代，橡胶工业发展很慢，大部分橡胶制品是外国货。解放以来，橡胶工业发展很快。以轮胎产量为例，1957年比1949年增加了三十三倍，1958年预计比1949年增加六十三倍。
    化工馆内展出的大小几十种规格的轮胎，表明我国不仅能制造飞机、汽车、拖拉机轮胎，而且制造技术已跃进世界先进水平。一个直径一点七公尺的大轮胎，是载重二十吨的卡车上使用的，每个轮胎的载重量就达到八吨。两三年前，人们才听说无内胎轮胎的名字，现在我国已经大量制造了。被称为轮胎最新技术成就的钢丝帘布轮胎、无帘线轮胎和胶乳轮胎等，在今年的大跃进中，我国职工也全部制造出来。各种轮胎行驶里程的增加也十分显著。现在一般载重汽车轮胎可以达到三万公里以上，城市公共汽车轮胎达到四万公里，最高到十八万公里。
