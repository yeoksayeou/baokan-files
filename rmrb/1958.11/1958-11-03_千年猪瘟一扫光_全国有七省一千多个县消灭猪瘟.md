Wipe Out Thousand-Year-Old Swine Fever
Seven Provinces and Over a Thousand Counties Across the Country Eliminate Swine Fever

    (Report from our newspaper) Amidst the overall great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, China's work in preventing and controlling swine fever also achieved unprecedented success in 1958. After more than half a year of arduous struggle, the large-scale epidemic of swine fever has been controlled nationwide. According to incomplete statistics from the National On-Site Conference on Preventing Animal Diseases held by the Ministry of Agriculture in Xingyang County, Henan Province, one thousand one hundred and forty-eight counties and cities across the country have basically eliminated swine fever, and seven provinces, including Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Gansu, Hebei, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, have emerged as basically free of swine fever.
    Due to the significant reduction in the prevalence of swine fever, the number of pig deaths has decreased significantly in various regions this year. In the first half of last year, pig deaths in Liaoning and Heilongjiang accounted for 4.6% and 3.7% of the total number of live pigs at the time, respectively, while in the first half of this year, pig deaths were less than 0.6%, and there have been no deaths since June. In Yishui County, Shandong Province, where swine fever has been prevalent for years, 15,000 pigs died in 1956, and 10,000 pigs died in the first half of 1957, but not a single pig has died this year.
    The great leap forward in the prevention and control of swine fever has powerfully promoted the development of pig production. The total number of pigs nationwide increased from over 140 million at the end of 1957 to over 200.1 million in August 1958, an increase of 38%. The increase in pigs is even faster in areas that have eliminated swine fever. At the end of 1957, Henan Province had 7.31 million pigs, which has now increased to 16 million, an increase of 119%. Xingyang County in this province, due to the elimination of swine fever, has reached 3.5 pigs per household, exceeding the target set by the National Agricultural Development Program for 1967 ahead of schedule.
    In this year's work on preventing and controlling swine fever, various regions have taken many effective measures. First, a large number of epidemic prevention personnel were trained. In the first half of the year, the ranks of epidemic prevention personnel in agricultural cooperatives and people's communes across the country had grown to one million. Second, large-scale preventive inoculations were carried out. According to incomplete statistics, the number of preventive inoculations for live pigs nationwide reached more than 95 million in the first half of the year, which is 35 million more than the number of preventive inoculations nationwide in 1957, equivalent to 84% of the total number of preventive inoculations during the first Five-Year Plan period. Third, environmental sanitation for live pigs was greatly improved in conjunction with the patriotic health campaign. Many agricultural cooperatives and people's communes have established veterinary hygiene systems with regular inoculations, regular disinfection, regular quarantine, and regular inspections, achieving the regularization and institutionalization of epidemic prevention work.

    千年猪瘟一扫光
    全国有七省一千多个县消灭猪瘟
    本报讯　在工农业生产全面大跃进的同时，1958年我国防治猪瘟的工作也取得空前巨大的成绩。经过半年多的苦战，在全国范围内已经控制了猪瘟的大面积流行。据农业部最近在河南荥阳县召开的全国防治兽疫现场会议上不完全统计，全国已经有一千一百四十八个县、市基本消灭了猪瘟，出现了黑龙江、辽宁、甘肃、河北、河南、安徽，江苏等七个基本无猪瘟的省。
    由于猪瘟流行范围的大大缩小，今年各地死猪头数显著减少。辽宁、黑龙江去年上半年死猪各占当时生猪总头数的4.6％和3.7％，而今年上半年死猪头数不到0.6％，6月以后，已没有死亡了。山东省沂水县连年猪瘟流行，1956年死猪一万五千头，1957年上半年死猪一万头，今年一头也没有死。
    防治猪瘟工作的大跃进，有力地促进了生猪生产的发展，全国生猪头数1958年8月已由1957年底的一亿四千多万头发展到二亿零一百多万头，增加了38％。消灭了猪瘟的地区生猪增长更快。河南省1957年底有猪七百三十一万头，目前已发展到一千六百万头，增加了119％。这个省荥阳县由于消灭了猪瘟，生猪头数已经达到每户三头半，提前超额实现了全国农业发展纲要规定的1967年的指标。
    在今年防治猪瘟工作上，各地都采取了许多有力的措施。首先训练了大批的防疫员，上半年全国农业社、人民公社的防疫员队伍已发展到一百万人。其次，开展了大规模的预防注射。据不完全统计，上半年全国生猪预防注射头数达到九千五百多万头次，比1957年全国预防注射头数多三千五百万头次，相当于第一个五年计划期间预防注射总头数的84％。再次，结合爱国卫生运动大力地改善了生猪的环境卫生。许多农业社、人民公社建立了定期注射、定期消毒、定期检疫、定期检查的兽医卫生制度，达到了防疫工作的经常化和制度化。
