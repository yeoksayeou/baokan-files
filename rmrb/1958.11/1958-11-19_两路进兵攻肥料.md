    Two-pronged Attack on Fertilizer
    Zhao Qi
    Many regions have already begun to march towards fertilizer production, and a national winter fertilizer accumulation campaign is about to unfold.
    Henan and Hunan provinces, after completing the autumn harvest and planting, are seizing the opportunity to manufacture indigenous chemical fertilizers on a large scale. This is a very timely thing and deserves great promotion. Doing so can not only meet the current needs of winter topdressing with quick-acting fertilizers for crops such as wheat and rapeseed but also prepare fertilizer reserves for next year. Therefore, large-scale production of indigenous chemical fertilizers is an important aspect of the march towards fertilizer production.
    The other aspect of the march towards fertilizer production should be the large-scale accumulation of farm manure. Winter is a great season for accumulating farm manure: river mud deposited in streams and ponds needs to be cleaned up in winter; cattle, horses, and other livestock mostly stay in sheds during winter; and farmers in northern regions generally burn kangs for heating; ... These situations indicate that farm manure sources are also very broad in winter. At the same time, agricultural activities are generally less frequent in winter than in spring, summer, and autumn, with more gaps, which makes it easier to widely mobilize the masses to accumulate more fertilizer.
    Some say that indigenous chemical fertilizer is the "refined grain" of crops, and farm manure is the "coarse grain" of crops. Indigenous chemical fertilizer has high and rapid efficacy and can be used in smaller quantities to meet the crop's urgent need for a certain fertilizer element, which should be greatly developed in the future. However, for crops, "refined grains" cannot replace "coarse grains." Countless experiences have proven that indigenous chemical fertilizers must be used in conjunction with farm manure to exert greater fertilizer efficiency. Because indigenous chemical fertilizer is inorganic fertilizer and farm manure is organic fertilizer, farm manure, in addition to containing various fertilizer elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, can also enhance soil fertility and facilitate the full play of inorganic fertilizer. This unique aspect of "coarse grain" is not available in any "refined grain."
    Many tasks require walking on two legs. In fertilizer accumulation work, it is also necessary to advance on two fronts—grasp indigenous chemical fertilizer and also grasp farm manure. Only in this way can we achieve a complete victory on the fertilizer accumulation front and prepare conditions for a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year.

    两路进兵攻肥料
    赵起
    不少地区已经开始向肥料进军了，一个全国规模的冬季积肥运动即将展开。
    河南和湖南等地，在完成秋收秋种以后，抓紧时机，大规模制造土化肥，这是一件很合时宜的事情，值得大大提倡。这样做，不仅能够满足当前小麦、油菜等作物冬前追施速效肥料的需要，还可以为明年作好肥料储备工作。因此，大造土化肥是向肥料进军的一个重要方面。
    向肥料进军的另一方面，应该是大积农家肥料。冬季是积聚农家肥料的大好季节：沉积在小溪、池塘里的河泥，有待冬季清理；牛、马等大小家畜在冬季多留在棚栏里面；北方地区的广大农户一般要烧炕取暖；……这些情况说明，在冬季农家肥源也非常广阔。同时，冬季的农事活动一般比春、夏、秋三季较少，空隙较多，这就便于广泛发动群众，多多积肥。
    有人说土化肥是农作物的“细粮”，农家肥料是农作物的“粗粮”。土化肥的肥效高，肥效快，可以用较少的数量来满足农作物对某种肥分的急需，今后要大大发展。但是，对作物来说，“细粮”并不能代替“粗粮”。无数的经验已经证明：土化肥必须同农家肥料配合使用，才能发挥出更大的肥效。因为土化肥是无机肥，农家肥料是有机肥，农家肥料除了具有氮、磷、钾等多种肥分以外，还可以增强土壤的肥力，有利于无机肥料肥分的充分发挥。“粗粮”的这种独特之处，是任何“细粮”所没有的。
    很多工作都需要用两条腿走路。在积肥工作上，也需要分两路进兵——抓土化肥，也抓农家肥。只有这样，才能在积肥战线上取得全胜，也才能为明年农业生产争取更大跃进准备好条件。
