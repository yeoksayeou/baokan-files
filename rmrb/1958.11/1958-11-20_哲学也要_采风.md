Philosophy Also Needs "Folksong Collecting"
Guan Feng

The great development of mass poetry is one of the amazing miracles since the Great Leap Forward. Currently, under the leadership of the Party, a large-scale folksong collecting movement is underway. What about philosophy? Does it need "folksong collecting"? Is there any "folk song" to collect? I believe that philosophy also has "folk songs" to collect, and not only does it have them, but they are extremely rich; large-scale "folksong collecting" is also very necessary for philosophy, which is very necessary for the development of philosophy.

The whole people studying philosophy has already begun, and the whole people running philosophy has also begun. Of course, the broad masses have not followed the so-called "conventional" approach, sitting down and studying philosophy in the study, perhaps they are not very clear about philosophical concepts such as "matter is primary, consciousness is secondary"; however, in order to solve practical problems, they have burst out with philosophical wisdom. Practice produces philosophy, and the Great Leap Forward in practice will inevitably lead to the Great Leap Forward in philosophy. Practice requires people to "engage in the abstract" -- "engaging in the abstract" is running philosophy. The broad masses, under the leadership of the Party, based on the practice of the Great Leap Forward, greatly "engage in the abstract," and will inevitably "engage" in the philosophy of the Great Leap Forward.

Since the Great Leap Forward, the philosophical wisdom of the masses has emerged in an endless stream. The philosophical wisdom of the masses is mostly not spoken in the usual philosophical terms, perhaps they are not aware that it is philosophy; however, they have spoken the truth and expressed the philosophical spirit of the times in simple language and simple forms. Pay attention to life and the philosophy of life, and you can see that the philosophical spirit of the times has been largely expressed in some new folk songs, new proverbs, new stories, big-character posters, slogans...

Here are a few examples.

There is such a familiar new folk song:
　　"There is no Jade Emperor in heaven, no Dragon King on earth;
　　I am the Jade Emperor, I am the Dragon King,
　　Order the Three Mountains and Five Ridges to open the way: I am coming!"
There is also a new folk song titled "Seizing Power from Heaven":
　　"Heavenly Grandpa, old thief official! Dictatorship for thousands of years;
　　You set the yield of crops every year, we suffer hunger and cold for generations.
　　Now we want to revolt against your life, large-scale development of water conservancy.
　　We will set the yield of crops, from now on you will always hand over the power."
Don't these two folk songs sing out the truth, the sign of the new era, that in our country's actual life, the leap from the "realm of necessity" to the "realm of freedom" has begun? Yes, our era is an era of "seizing power from heaven," an era of "I (the great revolutionary collective) am the Jade Emperor, I am the Dragon King," an era of "ordering the Three Mountains and Five Ridges to open the way." These vivid languages ​​speak of a great truth of life: in our country, the relationship between man and nature has reached a great historical turning point from passive to active, from defense to offense, from being a slave to being a master. Engels said that mankind's entry into socialist society from class society is "the leap from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom." This principle has become "dead" in the hands of some philosophical workers, and they even rack their brains to explain it to students; however, the masses have sung it "alive" and announced to people: we have begun the leap from the "realm of necessity" to the "realm of freedom."

Comrades! Tell me, is there any philosophy in this?

Right-leaning conservatives stubbornly do not believe in the plan for experimental fields to produce thousands of kilograms per mu. When the yield of thousands of kilograms per mu is realized, they have to "admit defeat" in the face of the facts, but they still do not believe in the plan for experimental fields to produce tens of thousands of kilograms per mu; and when the yield of tens of thousands of kilograms per mu is realized, they have to "admit defeat" in the face of the facts once again, but they still do not believe in the plan for experimental fields to produce hundreds of thousands of kilograms per mu... They are thus marching in place according to the pace of "one, two, one."

Listen to what the masses say!

There is a new folk song called "Happiness River": A township opened a new river, and everyone named the river. "The minds of the migrant workers are moving, and everyone is thinking carefully." Some said, let's call it "Thousand Kilogram River": "Opening this river will ensure a good harvest, and the three words 'Thousand Kilogram River' are really good." No! The masses think it is too conservative, too "metaphysical." Then, what about calling it "Ten Thousand Kilogram River" or "One Hundred Thousand Kilogram River"? No! That is still "metaphysics"; numbers cannot express the spirit of our era. The masses sang: "It should be called 'Happiness River', and future generations will have more happiness."

Comrades! Tell me, does this folk song have philosophy? Is it the right-leaning conservatives' in-place marching "one, two, one" that has Marxist-Leninist philosophy, or does this folk song have Marxist-Leninist philosophy?

Workers at the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory overcame great difficulties and successfully trial-produced a large-scale indigenous machine tool. Electrician Ren Genfu wrote a poem of praise:
　　"Indigenous produces foreign, foreign produces indigenous, indigenous and foreign flowers bloom everywhere;
　　Machine produces egg, egg produces machine, countless machines will come in the future."

Comrades! Tell me, doesn't this poem sing out the dialectic of "indigenous" and "foreign"? Some people only recognize "foreign" and do not recognize "indigenous"; some people only recognize "indigenous" and do not recognize "foreign," and do not recognize the transition from "indigenous" to "foreign" -- if they ponder this poem carefully, can't they gain enlightenment in their way of thinking?

Under the leadership of the Party, the masses have highly demonstrated the courage to create. They are practitioners who create material resources, and their courage is not a fantasy divorced from reality, but a courage in actual combat. The masses said: "Discovering shortcomings is discovering potential"! What a clear revolutionary stand, what a clear revolutionary dialectic! There are such people who, when they discover shortcomings in their work, "attack one point without considering the rest," and treat the shortcomings as clubs, picking them up to attack the mass movement. Some people shake their heads and sigh when they discover shortcomings; or, they feel that it is at least an ominous thing. But the masses say: "Discovering shortcomings is discovering potential." Yes, acknowledging people's subjective initiative, the revolutionary transformation, isn't discovering shortcomings discovering the goal of tapping potential?

"Discovering shortcomings is discovering potential" -- Comrades! Think about it, who can say that it is not living dialectics?

The ocean of philosophical wisdom in life is so vast! How can my clumsy pen describe it! Please allow me, this clumsy author, to give one more example:

Xingli Commune in Lushan County, Henan Province, is vigorously developing experimental fields this year. There are commune-level experimental fields, team-level experimental fields, women's experimental fields, and children's experimental fields. They also have an important feature: the commune-level experimental fields are called "satellite command fields," that is, they command the cultivation of large fields; the masses said: "People should follow the Communist Party, and crops should follow the command fields."

Comrades! Look, isn't their leadership method a dialectical leadership method? Isn't it further developing the experience of "experimental fields"?

Comrades! Think, isn't the concept of "satellite command fields," the phrase "people should follow the Communist Party, and crops should follow the command fields" a simple, preliminary, but essential philosophical summary of their work experience?

In the eyes of scholastic philosophers, none of the above has anything to do with philosophy; their only reason is: they did not discuss questions like "how many angels can stand on the head of a pin." Life will correct them -- if they are finally unwilling to go to see God with granite heads. Here, there is no need to argue with scholastic philosophers and disturb the readers!

Of course, I don't want to arbitrarily exaggerate the philosophy in new folk songs, new proverbs, new stories, as well as big-character posters and slogans... It still needs to be summarized, refined, sublimated, developed and systematized..., simply put, it needs to be improved. It also requires philosophical workers to popularize Marxist-Leninist philosophy to the masses. However, it is the fresh breeze of the philosophy of the times, a rich philosophical mineral deposit. If we avoid it, and do not let this fresh breeze blow our minds, and stubbornly stick to a few books, doing "philosophy research" like making "congee without rice" in a room, what kind of "improved" philosophy will be produced? To popularize it, what kind of philosophy will be popularized to the masses?

Chairman Mao said: "There are literary and artistic raw materials in the life of the people, which are natural and crude, but also the most vivid, richest, and most basic; in this respect, they dwarf all literature and art, and they are the inexhaustible and only source of all literature and art." He also said: "China's revolutionary writers and artists, promising writers and artists, must go to the masses, must unconditionally and wholeheartedly go to the worker-peasant-soldier masses for a long time, go to the fiery struggle, go to the only broadest and richest source, observe, experience, study, and analyze all people, all classes, all masses, all vivid forms of life and forms of struggle, all the original materials of literature and art, and then it is possible to enter the creative process." ("Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art")

These words are also completely applicable to philosophy and philosophical workers.

It is the Marxist line for the creation of literature and art.

Similarly, it is also the Marxist line for philosophical research work.

Today, in an era when the philosophical wisdom of the masses that has emerged with the Great Leap Forward in practice is particularly vigorous, it is particularly urgent to go to the masses and absorb philosophical wisdom.

This year, many philosophical workers have gone to factories and villages. Some people are actually doing "folksong collecting" in philosophy. However, not all of them are conscious; in particular, it has not formed a large-scale philosophical "folksong collecting" movement like folksong collecting in poetry. Therefore, I suggest that along with philosophical workers going to the countryside and factories, the whole people studying philosophy, and the whole people running philosophy, a large-scale philosophical "folksong collecting" work should be carried out, and the philosophical wisdom that has emerged in life should be collected first, and then systematically sorted out in a preliminary way. Newspapers or magazines (such as "Philosophical Research") can set up a special column called "Philosophical Folksong Collecting Record"; send out a batch of "Philosophical Folksong Collecting" paper, and ask everyone to write down a few of the new folk songs (not afraid of repeating with the "Folksong Collection"), new proverbs, new stories, new surprising sentences, new arguments, etc. that have philosophical meaning and send them in; if possible, it would be better to add a concise editor's note or explanation. The editorial department will select, collect, and continuously publish these materials. Then, we can also make more detailed selections, add more refined editor's notes or explanations, and publish "Philosophical 'Folksong Collecting' Collection".

I believe that carrying out the philosophical "folksong collecting" work is of great significance for promoting the Great Leap Forward in philosophy.

### 哲学也要“采风”

    哲学也要“采风”
    关锋
    群众诗歌的大发展，是大跃进以来的惊人奇迹之一。目前在党的领导下，正开展着一个大规模的采风运动。哲学呢，要不要“采风”？有没有“风”可采？我以为：哲学同样有“风”可采，不但有，而且是极为丰富；哲学也要大规模的“采风”，这对于发展哲学是很必要的。
    全民学哲学已经开始，而且也已经开始了全民办哲学。当然，广大群众并没有按照所谓“常规”，坐下来，到书斋里去研究哲学，也许他们对“物质第一性、意识第二性”这些哲学概念还不大了然；但是，他们为了解决实践中的问题，却迸发出了哲学的智慧。实践出哲学，实践的大跃进也必然引出哲学的大跃进。实践，要求人们“务虚”——“务虚”就是办哲学。广大群众，在党的领导下在大跃进的实践基础上大“务虚”，也就必然“务”出大跃进的哲学。
    大跃进以来，群众的哲学智慧，源源不绝地涌现了出来。群众的哲学智慧，大都不是用通常的哲学术语说出来的，也许他们没有意识到那就是哲学；但是，他们却是以朴素的语言、简单的形式说出了真理，表现了时代的哲学精神。留心一下生活和生活的哲学，就可以看出：时代的哲学精神，已经大量地在若干新民歌、新谚语、新故事、大字报、标语牌……中表现出来了。
    这里举几个例子。
    有这样一首大家熟悉的新民歌：
    “天上没有玉皇，地上没有龙王；
    我就是玉皇，我就是龙王，
    喝令三山五岭开道：我来了！”还有一首题为“向天夺权”的新民歌：
    “天爷爷，老贼官！独裁专制几千年；
     庄稼年年你定产，我们代代受饥寒。
     如今要革你的命，水利建设大发展。
     庄稼产量我们定，从今你永远交大权。”这两首民歌，不是唱出了在我国实际生活中已经开始了从“必然王国”向“自由王国”飞跃这个真理、这个新时代的标志吗？是的，我们的时代是“向天夺权”的时代，是“我（伟大的革命集体）就是玉皇，我就是龙王”的时代，是“喝令三山五岭开道”的时代。这些生动的语言，说出了一个伟大的生活真理：在我国，人对自然的关系，已经达到了由被动到主动、由防御到进攻，由作奴隶到作主人这样一个伟大的历史转折点。恩格斯说过，人类由阶级社会进入社会主义社会是“从必然的王国进于自由王国的飞跃”。这个原理在某些哲学工作者手上变“死”了，甚至绞尽脑汁也给学生讲不明白；但是，群众把它唱“活”了，并且向人们宣告：我们已经开始了从“必然王国”向“自由王国”的飞跃。
    同志！你说，这其中有没有哲学？
    右倾保守主义者，硬是不相信试验田亩产几千斤的计划，待到亩产几千斤实现了，他们不得不在事实面前“服输”，但是他们对试验田亩产几万斤的计划还是不相信；而亩产几万斤实现了，他们又不得不在事实面前“服输”一次，但是他们还是不相信试验田亩产十几万斤的计划……。他们就这样按照“一、二、一”的步伐在原地踏步。
    请听听群众怎么说吧！
    有一首新民歌叫作“幸福河”：一个乡开了一条新河，大家给这条河取名字，“民工同志脑筋动，个个心里细琢磨”，有的说，取名叫“千斤河”吧：“开了此河保丰收，‘千斤河’三字真不错。”不！群众嫌它太保守了，嫌它太“形而上学”了。那末，取名叫“万斤河”、“十万斤河”怎样？不！那也还是“形而上学”；数字并不能表现我们的时代的精神。群众唱道：“应该叫它‘幸福河’，后代子孙幸福多。”
    同志！你说，这首民歌有没有哲学？是右倾保守主义者的原地踏步的“一、二、一”有马列主义哲学，还是这首民歌有马列主义哲学？
    上海电机厂工人，克服了巨大困难，试制成功了大型土机床。电工任根福写了一首赞美诗唱道：
    “土生洋，洋生土，土洋花朵处处开；
    机生蛋，蛋生机，来日机器万万千。”
    同志！你说，这首诗不是唱出了“土”和“洋”的辩证法吗？有人只承认“洋”、不承认“土”；有人只承认“土”、不承认“洋”、不承认由“土”到“洋”——他们对这首诗细细琢磨一番，不是可以在思想方法上获得教益吗？
    群众在党的领导下，高度发挥了创造的胆量。他们是创造物质资料的实践者，他们的胆量不是脱离现实的幻想，而是实战的胆量。群众说：“发现了缺点，就是发现了潜力”！多么鲜明的革命立场，多么鲜明的革命辩证法啊！有这样一种人，他们发现了工作中的缺点，就“攻其一点，不及其余”，把缺点当作棍棒，拿起来去打击群众运动。有些人发现了缺点就摇头叹息；或者，觉得至少是不妙的事情。而群众却说：“发现了缺点就是发现了潜力”。是的，承认人的主观能动性，革命的改造作用，发现了缺点不就是发现了挖潜力的目标吗？
    “发现了缺点就是发现了潜力”——同志！你想，谁能说，它不是活生生的辩证法呢？
    生活的哲学智慧海洋，是多么辽阔啊！我这支秃笔怎能把它描写出来呢！请允许我这个笨拙的作者，再举一个例子吧：
    河南鲁山县幸丽社，今年大搞试验田，有社里的试验田，有队里的试验田，有妇女试验田，有儿童试验田。他们那里还有一个重要特点：社里的试验田，叫作“卫星指挥田”，即指挥大田的耕作；群众说：“人要跟着共产党走，庄稼要跟着指挥田走”。
    同志！你看，他们的领导方法不是辩证法的领导方法吗？不是更向前发展了“试验田”的经验吗？
    同志！你想，“卫星指挥田”这个概念，“人要跟着共产党走，庄稼要跟着指挥田走”这句话，不是对他们的工作经验作出了简单的、初步的、但是抓住了本质的哲学式的总结吗？
    在经院哲学家看来，上述这一些根本和哲学不沾边；他们的理由只有一条：没有讨论“一个针尖上站几个天使”之类的问题。生活会纠正他们的——如果他们终于不愿意带着花岗岩的脑袋去见上帝的话。这里，不必和经院哲学家争论，来打扰读者吧！
    当然，我也并不想把新民歌、新谚语、新故事以及大字报、标语牌……中的哲学，任意夸大。它还需要再总结、提炼、升华、发挥和系统化……，简单地说，需要提高。也需要哲学工作者向群众普及马克思列宁主义哲学。但是，它是时代哲学的清新之风，是丰富的哲学矿藏。如果避开它，不让这股清新之风吹吹脑筋，而死守着几本书，关在房子里做“无米粥”式的“哲学研究”，那会做出何种“提高”的哲学啊？要去普及，那会向群众普及了什么哲学啊？
    毛主席说：“人民生活中本来存在着文学艺术原料的矿藏，这是自然形态的东西，是粗糙的东西，但也是最生动、最丰富、最基本的东西；在这点上说，它们使一切文学艺术相形见绌，它们是一切文学艺术的取之不尽、用之不竭的唯一的源泉。”他又说：“中国的革命的文学家艺术家，有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去，观察、体验、研究、分析一切人，一切阶级，一切群众，一切生动的生活形式和斗争形式，一切文学和艺术的原始材料，然后才有可能进入创作过程。”（“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”）
    这些话对于哲学和哲学工作者，也是完全适用的。
    它是文学艺术的创作的马克思主义路线。
    同样，它也是哲学研究工作的马克思主义路线。
    在今天，随着实践大跃进而出现的群众哲学智慧特别昂扬的时代里，到群众中去，吸收哲学智慧，也就特别迫切了。
    今年有许多哲学工作者下厂下乡。哲学的“采风”，实际上也有些人在做了。但是，并不是都是自觉的；特别是远没有像诗歌采风那样形成一个大规模的哲学“采风”运动。因此，我建议与哲学工作者下乡下厂、全民学哲学、全民办哲学的同时，开展一个大规模的哲学“采风”工作，先把生活中涌现出来的哲学智慧，搜集起来，初步地加以系统的整理。报纸或者杂志（例如“哲学研究”）可以设一个“哲学采风录”专栏；发出一批“哲学采风”纸，请大家把有哲学意味的新民歌（不怕与“民歌集”重复）、新谚语、新故事、新惊句、新议论等等，写几条寄来；如果可能的话，加上简明的按语或说明就更好。编辑部对这些材料加以选择、集纳、连续发表。然后，还可以更细致的选择，加上更精炼的按语或说明，出版“哲学
  ‘采风’集”。
    我以为：开展哲学“采风”工作，对于推动哲学大跃进，是很有意义的。
