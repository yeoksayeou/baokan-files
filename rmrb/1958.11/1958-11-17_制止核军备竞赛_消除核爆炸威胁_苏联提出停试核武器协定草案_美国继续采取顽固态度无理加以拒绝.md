Xinhua News Agency, November 16th, TASS Moscow, November 15th: The Soviet Union has submitted a draft agreement on the cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests to the Geneva conference on the discontinuance of nuclear weapon tests.

The draft agreement stipulates:

    I. The Governments of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States solemnly undertake that, from the date of the signing of this Agreement, they shall not carry out any type of atomic or hydrogen weapon test.

    II. The three Governments undertake to promote the obligation of all other Governments in the world not to conduct any type of atomic or hydrogen weapon test.

    III. In order to supervise the implementation of the obligations contained in Article I of the Agreement, the three countries shall establish a supervisory body. The aforementioned supervisory body shall have a network of observation posts established in accordance with the recommendations of the Geneva Experts Conference.

    IV. The three Governments agree to establish an agreed number of observation posts on their own territories, and, in the case of the United States and the United Kingdom, on their territories or trust territories.

    V. The Agreement shall enter into force immediately upon signature.

The preamble to the draft agreement states that in order to curb the nuclear arms race, to prevent further improvements and the manufacture of new types of more destructive weapons of mass destruction, to take a practical step towards the “urgent goal of prohibiting atomic weapons and eliminating such weapons from national armaments,” as pointed out by the United Nations, and to eliminate forever the danger to the lives and health of the people of all countries in the world resulting from experimental nuclear weapon explosions, it has been decided to conclude this agreement for this purpose.

Xinhua News Agency, November 16th, Washington Dispatch: Following the submission by the Soviet Union of a draft agreement on the cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests for study by the Geneva conference on the discontinuance of nuclear weapon tests, the U.S. State Department immediately issued a statement on November 15th, saying that this draft agreement "is unacceptable to the United States and has been so notified to the Soviet representative during the conference."

This statement by the United States indicates that the U.S. government, in order to exacerbate international tensions, stubbornly refuses to permanently cease nuclear weapon tests. To justify this position, the State Department's statement once again resorted to the old trick of deliberately emphasizing the so-called "supervisory system necessary to fulfill the guarantees on paper," although the Soviet draft agreement has already made clear and reasonable provisions on this issue.

The statement also said that the United States believes that an agreement on the suspension of nuclear weapon tests should not only have "effective international supervision," but also stipulate the "details" of the supervisory system. This once again exposes that the United States is actually trying to create obstacles in the various tedious details of the supervisory issue to obstruct the reaching of an agreement on the permanent cessation of nuclear weapon tests.

    制止核军备竞赛　消除核爆炸威胁
    苏联提出停试核武器协定草案
    美国继续采取顽固态度无理加以拒绝
    新华社16日讯　塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：苏联向日内瓦不继续试验核武器会议提出了一个关于不继续原子武器和氢武器试验协定草案。
    这个协定草案规定：
    一、苏联、英国和美国三国政府庄严保证，自签订协定之日起，它们将不进行任何类型的原子武器和氢武器试验。
    二、三国政府保证促使世界其他各国政府也承担义务不进行任何类型的原子武器和氢武器试验。
    三、为了监督协定第一条所包含的义务的履行，三国建立监督机构。上述监督机构将拥有根据日内瓦专家会议的建议而设立的监督岗网。
    四、三国政府同意在本国领土上，以及对美国和英国而言在它们的领地或托管地上设立商定数目的监督岗。
    五、协定在签订后立即生效。
    协定草案的序言说，为了制止核军备竞赛、制止进一步改进和制造新类型的破坏性更大的大规模毁灭性武器，为了在联合国组织指出的“禁止原子武器并从各国军备中取缔这种武器这一迫切目标”方面迈出实际的一步，为了永远消除由于核武器试验性爆炸，而产生的对世界各国居民的生命和健康的危险，决定为此目的缔结这一协定。
    新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：苏联提交日内瓦不继续试验核武器会议研究的关于不继续原子武器和氢武器试验协定草案发表以后，美国国务院15日立即发表声明说，这个协定草案“是美国所不能接受的，已经在会议过程中这样通知了苏联代表”。
    美国的这一声明表明，美国政府为了加剧国际紧张局势，顽固地不愿永久停止核武器试验。为了替这个立场辩护，国务院的声明再次玩弄老一套的手法，故意强调要有所谓“履行纸上的保证所必需的监督制度”，虽然苏联的协定草案对这个问题已经作出了明确而合理的规定。
    声明还说，美国认为关于中止核武器试验的协定不但要有“有效的国际监督”，而且要规定监督制度的“细节”，这就再一次暴露了美国其实是要在监督问题的各种繁琐的细节上制造障碍，阻挠就永久停止核武器试验达成协议。
