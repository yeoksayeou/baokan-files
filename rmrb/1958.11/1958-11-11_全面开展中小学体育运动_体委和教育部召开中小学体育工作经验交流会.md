Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The State Physical Culture and Sports Commission and the Ministry of Education recently jointly held a national experience exchange meeting on physical education work in primary and secondary schools in Xuzhou. More than 470 representatives from sports commissions and education departments of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, as well as some primary and secondary school principals and physical education teachers, attended the meeting.

The meeting demanded that all regions resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instruction that the militia division "is a military organization, a labor organization, an educational organization, and a sports organization." Taking advantage of the current favorable situation of large-scale steelmaking and mass mobilization of the entire population for military training, before the end of this year, all primary and secondary schools should achieve "Four Reds" (100% of students, except for the sick and disabled, reach the four standards of the first and second grades of the Labor and Defense System, graded athletes, and ordinary shooters) and "Double Reds" (100% of students, except for the sick and disabled, reach the standards of the Labor and Defense System's junior level and junior athletes); and through the "Four Reds" and "Double Reds" movements, promote propaganda and education, teaching reform, sports technology revolution, and ideological transformation of physical education teachers.

During the meeting, Xuzhou City, Andong City, and Dunhua Korean Middle School in Jilin introduced their experiences in combining physical education with productive labor, combining physical education with mass military training, and achieving "Four Reds" and "Double Reds." The representatives also visited some primary and secondary schools such as Xuzhou No. 3 Middle School, where physical education work has been carried out well. Wei Que, Deputy Minister of Education, made a concluding speech at the end of the meeting.

The representatives unanimously agreed that in order to better implement the Party Central Committee's instruction that physical education work should "meet the needs of the broad masses of working people for strengthening their physique in the great leap forward in production, vigorously develop mass sports activities, and improve technical levels and continuously create new records on the basis of the widespread development of sports activities," and to realize the educational policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor," it is necessary to further comprehensively and rapidly develop physical education in primary and secondary schools. In carrying out physical education work in primary and secondary schools, it is necessary to ensure the absolute leadership of the Party, implement political leadership, implement the mass line, and vigorously promote mass movements.

The meeting focused on summarizing the experiences of the "Four Reds" and "Double Reds" movements, which are vigorously developing in primary and secondary schools across the country. It was unanimously agreed that this is a good way to further accelerate the popularization of physical education in primary and secondary schools, improve technical levels, and create new records, and it is also a powerful measure for physical education to implement the proletarian education policy. Experience in various regions has proven that after vigorously promoting the "Four Reds" and "Double Reds" movements in primary and secondary schools, the Party's leadership over physical education work has been universally strengthened, ensuring the rapid and healthy development of sports activities; the past erroneous tendencies of "sports for sports' sake" and "only talking about technology and not politics" have been thoroughly eliminated, as well as the myths that physical education work can only be "led by experts" and "formalized," so that the broad masses of teachers and students have received profound education in sports, recognized the struggle of the two lines in physical education work and its political significance, thereby loving physical exercise more and changing the past situation where only a few people participated in a cold and deserted manner into the current active situation where the broad masses are enthusiastically involved.

    全面开展中小学体育运动
    体委和教育部召开中小学体育工作经验交流会
    据新华社10日讯　体育运动委员会和教育部最近联合在徐州市召开了全国中小学体育工作经验交流会。出席这次会议的有全国各省、市、自治区体委和教育部门的代表，以及部分中小学校长、体育教师共四百七十多人。
    会议要求各地坚决贯彻毛主席关于民兵师“是军事组织，又是劳动组织，又是教育组织，又是体育组织”的指示，抓紧当前大炼钢铁、大搞全民武装的有利形势，今年年底以前，在中小学中全部分别实现“四红”（除病残外百分之百的学生达到劳卫制一级、二级、等级运动员和普通射手等四个标准）和“双红”（除病残外百分之百的学生达到劳卫制少年级和少年级运动员的标准）；并通过“四红”和“双红”运动作为宣传教育、教学改革、运动技术革命和体育教师的思想改造等工作。
    会议期间，徐州市、安东市以及吉林敦化朝鲜中学等单位介绍了体育与生产劳动相结合、体育与全民武装相结合和实现“四红”、“双红”等等经验。到会代表还曾到体育工作开展得较好的徐州三中等中小学参观。会议最后由教育部副部长韦悫作了总结。
    到会代表一致认为，为了更好地贯彻党中央关于体育工作要“适应生产大跃进中广大劳动人民对增强体质的要求，大力开展群众性体育运动，在体育运动广泛开展的基础上，提高技术水平，不断地创造新纪录”的指示，和实现“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”的教育工作方针，必须进一步全面迅速地开展中小学体育运动。在开展中小学体育工作中，必须保证党的绝对领导，实行政治挂帅，贯彻群众路线，大搞群众运动。
    会议着重总结了当前在全国中小学中蓬勃开展着的“四红”和“双红”运动的经验。一致认为，这是进一步加速普及中小学体育运动，提高技术水平，创造新纪录的一种良好形式，也是体育贯彻无产阶级教育方针的一项有力措施。各地经验证明：在中小学中大搞“四红”和“双红”运动后，普遍加强了党对体育工作的领导，保证了体育运动迅速健康的发展；彻底清除了过去“为体育而体育”、“只讲技术不讲政治”的错误倾向，和体育工作只能“由专家领导”和“正规化”的迷信，使广大师生在运动中受到了深刻的教育，认清了体育工作中两条路线的斗争及其政治意义，从而更加热爱体育锻炼，把过去只有少数人冷冷清清参加改变为目前广大群众轰轰烈烈的活跃局面。
