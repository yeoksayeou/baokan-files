Sand, Gravel, and Mud Shine

——An Introduction to the Glass Industry at the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition's Construction Industry Pavilion
By our reporter Zhao Chunlie

Who would have thought that sand, gravel, and mud could be used to draw silk, weave cloth, and manufacture ships, cars, and machines? However, the Construction Industry Pavilion has provided an excellent answer to this question.

Anyone who comes here will be attracted by these novel products. The glass fiber on display here is finer than silk, but its tensile strength is twice that of steel wire. According to theoretical calculations, if it were made into a rope the thickness of a little finger, it could lift a large car full of people, or even heavier objects. Glass fiber also has excellent electrical insulation properties. Using glass fiber instead of cotton yarn as insulation material for motors can reduce the motor's size by one-third. As for cloth woven from glass fiber, its uses are even greater.

Glass wool is the best heat-insulating and heat-preserving material, with a thermal conductivity that is two-thirds to four-fifths smaller than asbestos. Under the same insulation conditions, its weight is only one-thirtieth to one-fiftieth of asbestos. Because it can withstand high temperatures, it can be used not only in airplanes, cars, and ships, but also as the best heat-insulating material for rockets and missiles.

Fiberglass is lighter than aluminum and stronger than steel. It can not only replace steel and wood, but also has more wonderful advantages: it does not require welding and can be directly pressed into various complex large objects. In early September, the Nanjing Automobile Factory produced China's first fiberglass car.

The technology for making such useful things from sand, gravel, and mud is not out of reach. There is a diagram here that introduces the production process. First, sand, limestone, dolomite, and Suzhou white clay are melted in a kiln to make small glass balls. Then, they are placed in a crucible, heated and melted in an electric furnace. Then, a drawing machine can be used to draw glass fiber, or high-pressure steam can be used to blow glass wool. Adding about 30% plastic to the glass fiber or glass wool allows it to be pressed into fiberglass. I saw a demonstration of glass fiber drawing at the exhibition, which was truly wonderful. The glass balls flowed down the iron trough into the crucible in the electric furnace, and immediately turned into more than a hundred glass fibers. Another motor pulled the glass fibers down from countless small holes in the bottom of the crucible. The crowd of visitors seethed with excitement all day long, and everyone considered watching the glass fiber drawing performance their greatest wish.

China's glass industry, starting with the earliest Yaohua Glass Factory in Qinhuangdao, has a history of thirty-six years. Before liberation, it could only produce flat glass for construction, and many types of glass had to be imported. Since liberation, especially during the Great Leap Forward, the people in China engaged in glass research and production have created unprecedented miracles. During the first Five-Year Plan, two types of safety glass, tempered and laminated, appeared. This year, China's glass industry has successfully trial-produced and put into production twelve new varieties, many of which are world-leading technologies, such as the low-alkali, boron-free, heat-resistant, thick-walled glass tubes exhibited here. Currently, only the Soviet Union and China produce them using a non-crucible vertical suction method. It can withstand dozens of atmospheres of pressure and can replace various metal pipes, and is widely used in industrial and agricultural production. Using glass tubes is more than three-quarters cheaper than using copper, lead, cast iron, or seamless steel pipes. In front of the glass tube exhibits, there is also something that looks like iron: this is the iron brick made of bauxite that can withstand a high temperature of 1300 degrees Celsius, an indispensable refractory material for glass melting furnaces. In the past, only four countries, the Soviet Union, the United States, Japan, and France, could produce it, and the iron bricks used in China had to be imported. This year, China has started production at the Shenyang Glass Factory.

This year, China's glass industry has also trial-produced glass fertilizers containing various trace elements such as copper, manganese, zinc, and cobalt for agriculture. Here are bottles of glass fertilizers of different colors. From the introducer's explanation, people learned that this fertilizer, after being applied to the soil, can be slowly absorbed by crops year after year, reducing crop diseases and increasing yields by more than 20%.

From ancient times to the present, sand, gravel, and mud, which have always been regarded as worthless and ubiquitous, can now replace various materials, be made into more products, and be more widely used in people's production and life.

    砂石泥巴大放光彩
    ——全国工业交通展览会建筑工业馆玻璃工业介绍

    有谁能想到用砂石、泥巴也能拉丝、织布、制造船舶、汽车和机器呢？但是，建筑工业馆已对这个问题作了很好的回答。
    不论谁一来到这里，都会被这些新奇的产品吸引住。这里陈列的玻璃丝比蚕丝还要细，但它的拉力强度却比钢丝高一倍，按照理论来计算，如果并成小手指粗的绳，就能吊起一辆乘满人的大汽车，或者更重的东西。玻璃丝还有很好的电绝缘性，用玻璃丝代替棉纱作电动机的绝缘材料，可使电动机体积减小三分之一。至于用玻璃丝织成的布，它的用场就更大了。
    玻璃棉是最好的隔热、保温材料，导热系数比石棉小三分之二到五分之四，在同样隔热的情况下，重量仅为石棉的三十分之一到五十分之一。由于它能耐高温，不仅可用于飞机、汽车、轮船，而且也是火箭、导弹的最好隔热材料。
    玻璃钢比铝轻，比钢强度大，不但可代替钢铁、木材，而且具有更妙的优点，不用焊接，可以直接压成各种复杂的大型物体。南京汽车制造厂在9月初已经用玻璃钢制出我国第一辆玻璃钢小汽车。
    用砂石、泥巴制出这样有用的东西，技术并不是高不可攀的。这里有一块图板向人们介绍了它们的生产过程。先把砂石、石灰石、苦灰石、苏州白土放在窑内熔化，制成一粒粒小玻璃球，再放在坩锅里用电炉加热熔化后，就可用拉丝机拉成玻璃丝，或用高压蒸气吹成玻璃棉。把玻璃丝或玻璃棉加入30％左右的塑料，就可压成玻璃钢。我在展览会上看到拉制玻璃丝的表演，真是精彩极了。玻璃球从上面顺着铁槽流入电炉中的坩锅里，立即变成一百多条的玻璃丝，另一部电动机就从坩锅下面的无数小孔中把玻璃丝拉下来。这里成天沸腾着参观的人群，每个人都以观看拉玻璃丝的表演为最大愿望。
    我国玻璃工业从生产最早的秦皇岛耀华玻璃厂算起，到现在有三十六年历史。解放前，只能生产建筑用的平板玻璃，多种玻璃还要进口。解放以来，特别是在大跃进中，我国从事玻璃研究和生产的人们，已经创造出史无前例的奇迹。第一个五年计划时期出现了钢化和夹层两种安全玻璃，今年我国玻璃工业试制成功和投入生产的又有十二种新品种，其中不少是世界尖端技术，如在这里展出的低碱无硼耐热厚壁玻璃管，目前世界上只有苏联和我国用无?垂直吸上方法生产。它能耐几十个大气压力，可以代替各种金属管，广泛用到工农业生产中去。使用玻璃管要比铜管、铅管、铸铁管、无缝钢管便宜四分之三以上。在玻璃管展品的前面，还有一种形色如铁的东西，这就是能耐一千三百度高温，用矾土制成的铁砖，玻璃熔窑不可少的耐火材料。过去只有苏、美、日、法等四个国家能够生产，我国所用的铁砖都要由国外进口，今年我国在沈阳玻璃厂已经开始生产。
    我国玻璃工业今年还为农业试制出含有铜、锰、锌、钴等各种微量元素的玻璃肥料。这里摆着一瓶瓶颜色不同的玻璃肥料。从讲解员的介绍，人们才知道这种肥料，施在土壤中后，可以一年年被农作物慢慢吸收，能使农作物减少病害，提高产量两成以上。
    从古至今，一直被人视为半文不值，遍地皆是的砂石、泥巴，现在能够代替各种材料，制成更多的产品，更加广泛地被利用到人们的生产、生活领域中来。
