    Studying Theory Creates a Production Upsurge
    Deng Xuan
    Wearing a tattered hat with a hole in the top,
    Clothed in a worn-out robe, hot in summer and cold in winter,
    At night, lodging in temples, keeping company with gods,
    In the daytime, relying on the gate tower, wailing constantly.
    This is a true depiction of the suffering of the peasant masses of Dengfeng County, where the mountains are high, the rocks are thick, and the soil is thin, before liberation. At that time, the poor and blank Dengfeng County had only a few "literate" people, all of whom were living devils serving the landlord class, while the vast number of peasants were illiterate.

    Nationwide Enrollment in Universities, Everyone Studies Philosophy
    After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the broad masses of working people have turned over politically, economically, and culturally. Through the nationwide rectification movement, a vigorous all-round great leap forward situation has emerged. On March 5, 1958, Dengfeng achieved the status of a "county without illiteracy," followed by the popularization of primary and secondary education and the establishment of Red and Expert Schools for cadres and Red and Expert Universities for all.

    After the launch of the Marxist education movement throughout the county, 191 Marxist colleges and 191 philosophy research offices were quickly established. Adhering to the principles of putting politics in command and respecting the able as teachers, they hired more than 1,100 philosophy teachers, basically achieving one philosophy teacher for each production team. More than 190,000 people participated in philosophy studies, accounting for more than 93% of the county's total population over the age of fourteen, forming a high tide of nationwide enrollment in universities, everyone studying philosophy, and ten thousand people teaching everyone to study. In the past six months, they have successively studied "Basic Knowledge of Philosophy," "On Contradiction," "On Practice," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "Resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party," and other relevant sections, as well as important Party policies. Through study, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people throughout the county has been greatly boosted, and the people's communes have been consolidated.

    At the beginning of the nationwide philosophy study movement, some people had serious doubts about whether peasants could study philosophy and whether township cadres could teach philosophy. Some people believed that philosophy was a university course, and how could the "semi-literate" understand it? Philosophy teachers are university professors and students who have studied abroad, and how could we have such people in the countryside? In response to this ideological situation, the Party committees of various townships, under the direct leadership of the county Party committee, launched a nationwide special debate. Through debate, various superstitions about studying philosophy were broken, and the people's minds were liberated. It was unanimously agreed that philosophy comes from the masses and from the struggle for production; it is their own philosophy, and of course they can understand it; township cadres are practitioners of Marxist philosophy and can certainly teach philosophy. Thus, the nationwide philosophy study movement was launched.

    They also broke the idea of ​​superstition in textbook knowledge in terms of teaching materials. The Party committees of various townships compiled philosophy lectures based on the principles of philosophy and combined with local realities. For example, the Party committee of the Dongfeng People's Commune used easy-to-understand facts to compile a preliminary draft of a twenty-lesson "Peasant Philosophy Textbook" for each principle of philosophy, which was very suitable for the tastes of the masses, and the masses also loved to learn it. The examination system also broke with superstition. The examination of the achievements of farmers studying philosophy was not answering papers or memorizing articles, but examining practical ability. After each lesson, large-character posters were used to examine thinking and actual work.

      Everything is Teaching Material, Everywhere is a Classroom
    Starting from reality, everything is teaching material, and everywhere is a classroom. This is the characteristic and effective experience of Dengfeng County's nationwide philosophy study. Although district and township cadres who have been working in rural areas for a long time are practitioners and creators of philosophy, they have not taught philosophy in the past, so they inevitably encountered some difficulties in teaching. At the beginning, they followed the "Basic Knowledge of Philosophy" textbook and read the scriptures verbatim, but the masses did not understand. Many people said that it was like listening to heavenly scriptures, and some even asked to stop studying philosophy. Later, they boldly broke the shackles of books, started from reality, and carried out teaching according to the method of linking theory with practice. They used stories most familiar to the masses, linked them to the current revolutionary struggle, production practice, and the thoughts of students, combined them with philosophical principles to analyze and explain, and finally summarized and rose to theory to guide the struggle for production. This way, the road opened up. For example, when the Ma Lie College of the Sanguanmiao Red and Expert University taught about the primacy of matter and the secondarity of knowledge, they moved a stone to the desk. At the beginning of the lecture, the teacher asked the masses, "What is this?" The masses answered, "That is a stone." The teacher went on to say, "If there were no stone in the world at all, how could we know that there is a stone?" At this time, the teacher began to tell the masses, "Stone is matter. We only knew about stone because there was stone in the world. This relationship of precedence is called the primacy of matter and the secondarity of spirit. After we understand the characteristics of stone, we use it to repair reservoirs and build houses. This is the subjective initiative of people. The primacy of matter, the secondarity of spirit, and the subjective initiative are philosophy." After this lesson, everyone's interest in learning increased. From then on, no one complained that philosophy was difficult to learn.

    The county's philosophy study did not have fixed teaching times and locations. Wherever there were masses, they taught there. Production sites, rest times, meeting places, and meal places were all good places for the masses to study philosophy. All kinds of work and everything were philosophical teaching materials, and the all-round great leap forward had rich philosophical content. For example, the philosophy teachers of the Sanguanmiao Ma Lie College lectured workers on epistemology at the reservoir construction site; they used the story of the layered cake, which the masses were most familiar with, to tell the masses that the development of things is not isolated at the dining place; and they had a practical debate face-to-face with religious believers, defeated theism, and eliminated religious superstitious thoughts among the masses.

    Combining Production, Promoting Production
    When the Sanguanmiao Production Brigade of the Dongfeng People's Commune studied the dialectics of "On Contradiction," they explained the universality of contradiction by linking it to examples collected in their township. In 1955, two young men from the production team signed up to join the army, but later they were unwilling to go because their families were holding them back. A cadre went to mobilize the wife of the first young man, cleared her mind, and the contradiction was resolved. The cadre thought that the second young man's wife was also holding him back, so he went to mobilize the second young man's wife in the same way. But as soon as he opened his mouth, the young man's wife said, "Please help me to clear his mother's mind, okay?" It turned out that the one who was holding him back was the young man's mother. The teacher said: Both young men who joined the army were held back, but the people who were holding them back were different. This is the particularity of contradiction. If you don't understand the particularity of contradiction in your work and copy mechanically, you will inevitably make subjectivist mistakes. When Fan Fugui, the secretary of the Dongfeng People's Commune, arranged work this summer, he also explained the universality and particularity of contradiction to the masses in the fields in conjunction with summer planting. He said: All crops must go through the five stages of deep plowing and careful cultivation, fine varieties, sufficient fertilizer application, timely watering, and strengthened management to achieve a bumper harvest. This is the universality of contradiction, but different crops have different requirements. For example, a bumper harvest of corn depends on early sowing, and a bumper harvest of sweet potatoes depends on shallow planting. This is the particularity of contradiction.

    Because philosophy study starts from production and work, the level of understanding of cadres and the masses has been improved, working methods have been improved, and the production leap forward and technological revolution have been greatly promoted. After cadres learned philosophy, three new atmospheres appeared in the countryside: there was less subjectivism, more investigation and research, and a stronger mass viewpoint. For example, Fan Yukun, a farmer from the October Cultural Team, conducted more than 40 kinds of agricultural experiments and succeeded in more than 20 kinds. The masses all over the county sang everywhere: "Studying philosophy is good, studying philosophy is good, studying philosophy can improve thinking. Studying philosophy is good, studying philosophy is good, studying philosophy makes working methods correct. No subjectivism, no dogmatism, empiricism, and one-sided viewpoints are overcome. Go all out and strive for the top, and it won't be wrong to do things according to the truth. Studying philosophy is good, studying philosophy is good, studying philosophy makes everyone smarter. Engage in inventions and creations, and the subjective initiative of people is brought into play. Dare to think, dare to do, dare to realize, and welcome the early arrival of communism!"

    In Dengfeng County, Marxist philosophical theory has become the key and source of strength to enlighten the wisdom of the working masses, break superstition, liberate thought, and create miracles. The nationwide philosophy study movement in Dengfeng County prominently proves what Marx said: "Theory, as soon as it grasps the masses, immediately produces a material force."

    学理论高潮带来了生产高潮
    登宣
    头戴一顶开花帽窟窿朝天，
    身穿着八卦衣夏热冬寒，
    夜晚间宿庙内与神作伴，
    白日里靠门楼哭叫连天。
    这就是解放前山高石厚土薄的登封县农民群众痛苦生活的写照。那时候，既穷且白的登封县，仅有的几个“知书达理”的人，尽是为地主阶级服务的活阎王，广大农民则是目不识丁。
    全民上大学　人人学哲学
    解放后，广大劳动群众在共产党领导下，在政治上、经济上、文化上都翻了身。通过全民整风运动，更出现了蓬蓬勃勃全面大跃进的形势。1958年3月5日登封实现了“无文盲县”，接着又普及了中小学教育，开办了干部红专学校、全民红专大学。
    全县开展马克思主义教育运动后，很快就建立了马克思主义学院一百九十一处，哲学研究室一百九十一个。他们按照政治挂帅、能者为师的原则，聘请一千一百余名哲学教师，基本上达到每一个生产专业队都有一个哲学教师。参加哲学学习的达十九万余人，占十四岁以上的全县总人口的93％以上，形成了全民上大学，人人学哲学，万人教全民学的高潮。半年来先后学习了“哲学常识”、“矛盾论”、“实践论”、“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”、“中共中央八届二次会议决议”等有关部分，和党的重要政策。通过学习，大大鼓舞了全县人民的革命情绪，巩固了人民公社。
    在开展全民学哲学的运动开始时，关于农民能不能学哲学、乡干部能不能教哲学，曾经有人发生过重重怀疑。有人认为哲学是大学的课程，老粗“识三个字”怎能学得通？教哲学的是大学教授、留洋生，咱农村那有这样的人？等等。针对这种思想情况，各乡党委在县委直接领导下，开展了全民性的专题辩论。通过辩论破除了对学哲学的各种迷信，群众的思想解放了。一致认为哲学来自群众，来自生产斗争，自己的哲学，自己当然学得通；乡干部是马克思主义哲学的实践者，当然能教哲学。于是全民学哲学的运动，开展起来了。
    他们也打破了在教材方面迷信书本知识的思想，各乡党委都按照哲学的原理，结合当地实际，编写了哲学讲义，如东风人民公社党委会把哲学上的各个原理都运用通俗易懂的事实编写了二十课“农民哲学课本”初稿，很适合群众口味，群众也非常爱学。在考试制度上也打破了迷信，农民学哲学的成绩的考查不是答卷子，又不是背条文，而是考查实际能力，在每学完一课后都要用大字报来检验思想和实际工作。
      万物皆教材　随处是课堂
    从实际出发，万物皆教材，遍地是课堂，是登封县全民学哲学的特点和行之有效的好经验。长期在农村工作的区乡干部虽然是哲学的实践者，创造者，但因为他们过去没有教过哲学，所以在教学中也就不可避免地要遇到一些困难。开始时按照“哲学常识”课本，照本念经，群众不懂。不少人说这像听天书一样，还有人要求停止哲学学习。后来，他们大胆的打破了书本的束缚，从实际出发，按照理论联系实际的方法，进行教学，以群众最熟悉的故事，联系当前的革命斗争、生产实践、学员思想，结合哲学原理进行分析讲解，最后归纳上升为理论，指导生产斗争。这样路就走通了。如三官庙红专大学马列主义学院在教物质第一性，认识第二性时，搬了一块石头放到课桌上，讲课开始时，教员问群众说“这是什么？”群众回答说：“那是石头”。教员接着说：“如果世界上根本就没有石头，那我们咋能知道有石头呢？”这时教员开始给群众讲：“石头就是物质，世界上有了石头，我们才认识了石头。这种先后关系就叫做物质第一性，精神第二性。我们认识了石头的特性以后，就运用它修水库，盖房屋，这就是人的主观能动作用。物质第一性，精神第二性，主观能动作用等就是哲学。”上了这一课大家的学习兴趣提高了。从此再没人反映哲学难学了。
    这个县的哲学学习并没有固定的教学时间和地点。哪里有群众，就到哪里教，生产工地、休息时、会场、饭场都是群众学哲学的好场所。各种工作一切事物都是哲学教材，全面大跃进就有丰富的哲学内容。如三官庙马列学院的哲学教员在水库工地上给工人讲认识论；在饭场上以群众最熟悉的千层糕的故事给群众讲事物的发展不是孤立的道理；和宗教迷信者面对面地进行了切实的大辩论，打败了有神论，扫除了群众中的宗教迷信思想。
    结合生产　推动生产
    东风人民公社三官庙生产大队，学习“矛盾论”的辩证法时联系本乡征集的事例讲解了矛盾的普遍性。1955年该生产队有两个青年报名参军，后来因为家中有人拉腿，却不愿去了。一位干部去动员了第一个青年的爱人，打通了思想，矛盾解决了。这个干部满以为第二个青年也是爱人拉腿，便照样去动员第二个青年的爱人。可是他一开口，这个青年的爱人就说：“请你帮助我去打通他娘的思想好不好？”原来拉腿的是这位青年的母亲。教师就说：两个青年参军都有拉后腿的，但是拉后腿的人不同，这是矛盾的特殊性；在工作中如果不懂矛盾的特殊性，死搬硬套，势必犯主观主义的错误。东风人民公社秘书范富贵今年夏季安排工作时，在田间也结合夏种给群众讲了矛盾的普遍性和特殊性。他说：所有庄稼要取得丰收都必须经过深耕细作，优良品种，施足肥料，适时浇水，加强管理五道关，这是矛盾的普遍性，而各种庄稼又有不同的要求，如玉米丰收在早播，红芋丰收在浅栽，这是矛盾的特殊性。
    哲学学习由于从生产出发，工作出发，干部和群众的认识水平提高了，工作方法改进了，大大推动了生产跃进和技术革命。干部学了哲学后，农村出现了三大新气象：主观主义少了，调查研究多了，群众观念强了。如十月文化队的农民范玉坤，进行了四十多种农业试验，成功了二十多种。全县群众到处歌唱着：“学习哲学好，学习哲学好，学习哲学能把思想来提高。学习哲学好，学习哲学好，学了哲学工作方法正确了。不主观不教条，经验主义、片面观点克服了。鼓足干劲争上游，按着真理办事错不了。学习哲学好，学习哲学好，学了哲学人人变得聪明了。搞发明搞创造，人的主观能动作用发挥了。敢想、敢干、敢实现，迎接共产主义早来到！”
    在登封县，马克思主义的哲学理论，已成为启发劳动群众智慧，破除迷信，解放思想，创造奇迹的钥匙和力量源泉。登封县的全民学哲学运动突出的证明了马克思所说的：“理论只要一掌握群众，就立刻产生出物质的力量。”
