    Not Harvested Cleanly - Another Round
    Many Regions Launch "Second Autumn Harvest" Campaign
    (Our newspaper reports) Many regions that have completed or are about to complete the harvest have launched a second autumn harvest campaign to thoroughly clean up the autumn harvest battlefield and collect all the remaining grains, cotton, and oil crops.
    The results of the "Second Autumn Harvest" are significant. In the first phase, Changzhi, Yanbei, Yuci, and other areas in Shanxi Province recovered more than 121.1 million catties of grain. In Zunhua County, Hebei Province, during the re-inspection of the autumn harvest in late October, more than 3 million catties of sweet potatoes were recovered in five days. As of November 5th, Yi County, Heishan, Chaoyang, and other counties in Liaoning had recovered more than 2 million catties of grain. Many areas in the south also recovered a lot of oil tea fruit and rice grains by re-harvesting oil tea and re-threshing rice straw.
    In carrying out the second autumn harvest, all regions used the method of presenting the facts and carefully calculating accounts to mobilize the enthusiasm of commune members for careful harvesting and meticulous threshing. The Party Committee of the "Satellite" People's Commune in Huarong County, Hunan, found that the rice straw in the Yaoshi Brigade was not threshed cleanly during the re-inspection. It immediately convened a meeting of key personnel above the level of production team leader in the commune at the site, launched a field debate, and quickly mobilized more than 8,900 laborers to advance in two groups, one to re-thresh the rice straw and the other to pick up ears of grain in the fields, recovering a total of 450,000 catties of rice in four days. After realizing the harm of scattering through accounting, the members of the Wusi People's Commune in Ganyu County, Jiangsu, re-plowed the harvested sweet potato and peanut fields.
    Many people's communes have put forward specific requirements in the re-harvesting and re-threshing to ensure the quality of the re-harvesting and re-threshing. The Hongqi People's Commune in Liuyang, Hunan, proposed that sweet potatoes should be "three clean," which means: picking up all the potato stalks, turning over all the potato soil, and digging out all the sloping land; rice should be "four checked," which means: checking the threshing ground, checking the rice straw, checking the rice husks, and checking the pile of shriveled grains; and for picking oil tea seeds, it also proposed "eight clean," such as: picking all the high branches, picking all the small tea seeds, and picking all the scattered branches. During the grain and cotton picking blitz week in the Jinzhou area of Liaoning, everyone was required to: go to the field without empty hands, "two clean" (pick up all the grain and cotton), and "one bare" (the ground is bare).
    The elderly, children, and some women are a large army in the re-harvesting and grain picking. In Kang County, Jiangxi, more than 18,000 elderly and children participated in grain picking for more than half a month, picking a total of more than 75,000 catties of grain. During the autumn harvest, Nanxiong County in Guangdong organized more than 6,000 children to regularly pick up ears of grain in the fields. The Friendship, Dagong, and Dawa Communes in Changtu County, Liaoning Province, have all organized grain picking teams of the elderly and children.

### 没有收净  再来一次  许多地区开展“二次秋收”运动

    没有收净  再来一次
    许多地区开展“二次秋收”运动
    本报讯　许多已经收获完或将要收获完的地区，纷纷开展了复收复打的二次收秋运动，彻底打扫秋收战场，把遗漏的粮食、棉花、油料全部收清拾净。
    “二次秋收”的成绩很大。山西省的长治、雁北、榆次等地区，在开始的第一阶段就拣回粮食一亿二千一百多万斤。河北省遵化县在10月下旬的复查秋收中，五天里拾回甘薯三百多万斤。辽宁义县、黑山、朝阳等县到11月5日，已拣回粮食二百多万斤。南方许多地区也在复收油茶和复打稻草中捞回很多油茶果和稻谷。
    各地在进行二次秋收中，都运用了摆事实、算细账的方法，调动起社员精收细打的积极性。湖南华容县宁乡“卫星”人民公社党委在复查中发现腰市大队稻草打得不净，立即在现场召开了全社生产队长以上的骨干会议，开展田头辩论，很快动员了八千九百多个劳动力分两路进兵，一路复打稻草，一路到田间拾穗，在四天里共收回稻谷四十五万斤。江苏赣榆县五四人民公社的社员通过算账，认识到抛撒的损害以后，在已收过的甘薯、花生田里重刨了一遍。
    不少人民公社在复收复打中都提出了具体要求，保证了复收复打的质量。湖南浏阳红旗人民公社提出红薯要“三光”，就是：薯蔸拣光、薯土翻光、坡地挖光；稻谷要“四查”，就是：查晒禾场、查稻草、查禾衣子、查秕谷堆；对摘油茶子也提出：高枝摘净、小茶子摘净、零星枝摘净等“八净”。辽宁锦州地区在拣粮拣棉突击周中，要求每个人都做到：人人下地不空手，“两净”（粮、棉拣净）、“一光”（地里光）。
    老人、儿童和部分妇女是复收拣粮中的一支大军。江西南康县在半个多月里有一万八千多个老人、小孩参加拣谷，共拣谷七万五千多斤。广东南雄县在秋收期间组织了六千多个儿童，经常在田间拾禾串。辽宁省昌图县友谊、大公、大洼公社都组织了老人、儿童拣粮队。
