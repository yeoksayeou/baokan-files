    "News Front" Publishes Chairman Mao's Instructions on Newspaper Work
    (Our dispatch) The thirteenth issue of "News Front," published on November 24th, carries a letter from Comrade Mao Zedong on newspaper work to Comrades Liu Jianxun, First Secretary of the CPC Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee, and Wei Guoqing, Secretary of the Secretariat. This letter was written in Nanning in January of this year. Chairman Mao pointed out in the letter: "The issue of provincial newspapers is an extremely important one, worthy of serious study, together with the editors of the Guangxi Daily, including the layout, news, editorials, theory, literature, and art, etc. Delve into it, think again and again, analyze and analyze again, compare and compare with the newspapers of other provinces, and a path can be found in a few months." Chairman Mao emphasized in the letter: "Carefully writing editorials is an extremely important task. You yourselves, the Minister of Propaganda, the Secretary-General, and the Editor-in-Chief of the newspaper, should study together. It is necessary for the First Secretary to take the lead and personally revise some of the most important editorials." Chairman Mao finally pointed out in the letter: "A provincial newspaper has a great organizational, encouraging, stimulating, critical, and promoting effect on the work of the entire province and the entire people."
    In the same issue of "News Front," an article by Comrade Liu Jianxun was also published, entitled: "Conscientiously Implement Chairman Mao's Instructions on Newspaper Work." The article focuses on explaining the improvements that Guangxi Daily has achieved under the assistance of all comrades in the Party in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, and the main practices of the Autonomous Region Party Committee in leading the newspaper in the past year.

    毛主席说办好省报十分重要
    新闻战线刊载毛主席对报纸工作的指示
    本报讯　11月24日出版的第十三期“新闻战线”，刊载了毛泽东同志就报纸工作问题写给中共广西僮族自治区委员会第一书记刘建勋、书记处书记韦国清二同志的信。这封信是今年1月间在南宁写的。毛主席在信中指出：“省报问题是一个极重要问题，值得认真研究，同广西日报的编辑们一道，包括版面、新闻、社论、理论、文艺等项。钻进去，想了又想，分析又分析，同各省报纸比较又比较，几个月时间就可以找出一条道路来的。”毛主席在信中着重指出：“精心写作社论是一项极重要任务，你们自己、宣传部长、秘书长、报社总编辑，要共同研究。第一书记挂帅，动手修改一些最重要的社论，是必要的。”毛主席在信中最后指出：“一张省报，对于全省工作，全体人民，有极大的组织、鼓舞、激励、批判、推动的作用。”
    在同一期的“新闻战线”上，还登载了刘建勋同志的文章，题目是：“认真执行毛主席关于报纸工作的指示”。文章着重说明了遵照毛主席的指示，在全党同志协助之下，广西日报已经取得的改进，和将近一年以来，自治区党委对报纸领导的主要做法。
