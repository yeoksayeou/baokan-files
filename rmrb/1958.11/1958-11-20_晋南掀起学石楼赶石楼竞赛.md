Jin Nan Launches a Competition to Learn From and Catch Up With Shilou

(Our report) The low-yielding and impoverished Shilou County in the Lvliang Mountain area of Shanxi Province has seen a great leap forward in agricultural production this year. The total grain output has increased more than fivefold compared to last year, with an average yield of 1,004 catties per mu, an increase of 19.5 times compared to last year. The average grain per person reached more than 2,500 catties. Recently, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee awarded the county a banner of "The First Thousand-Catty County in the Lvliang Mountains." Following this, leading cadres from 28 counties in the Jinnan Special Zone held an on-site meeting here to visit and summarize the county's experience in changing its low-yield and impoverished situation, launching a competition to learn from Shilou and catch up with Shilou throughout the region.

Shilou is the county with the smallest population and the largest area in the Jinnan Special Zone. The terrain is high, 1,200 meters above sea level, with crisscrossing ravines and thin soil. Nearly 90% of the 380,000 mu of cultivated land are steep slopes of about 50 degrees, making cultivation very difficult. It is often said: "A harvest of 50% is considered a good harvest, and a yield of more than one dou per mu is a good year." This year, in addition to using the original 40,000 mu of gully flatland as "basic farmland," concentrating efforts to increase fertilizer application and cultivate carefully, revolutionary measures were also taken to build dams in the gullies to flood the land, stop cultivating sloping land and return it to grass and forest, and newly flooded 50,000 mu of gully land. Through building dams, masonry soil to cushion the gullies, and sowing seeds simultaneously, more than 40 million catties of autumn grain were harvested from 30,000 mu of new gully land in the same year. 140,000 mu of forest have been planted on the stopped slope land, and 20,000 mu of pasture have been planted. The desolate natural landscape has changed this year.

Recently, the County Party Committee put forward the grand ambition of conquering nature, deciding to achieve a county with a wheat yield of 5,000 catties per mu and an autumn grain yield of 10,000 catties per mu next year, and to plant the red flag of a great leap forward in agricultural production even higher.

    晋南掀起学石楼赶石楼竞赛
    本报讯　山西省吕梁山区低产贫瘠的石楼县今年农业生产大放光彩，粮食总产量比去年增加了五倍多，平均亩产一千零四斤，比去年提高了十九倍半，每人平均粮食达到二千五百多斤。最近中共山西省委和省人民委员会把一面“吕梁山上第一个千斤县”的锦旗，奖给了这个县，接着，晋南专区二十八个县的领导干部在这里举行现场会议，参观、总结了这个县改变低产贫瘠面貌的经验，在全区掀起了学石楼、赶石楼的竞赛运动。
    石楼是晋南专区人口最少面积最大的一个县。地势高亢，拔海一千二百公尺，沟壑纵横交错，土质菲薄。三十八万亩耕地近90％是五十度左右的陡坡地，耕作条件十分困难。常是：“收获五成算丰收，亩产过斗好年成”。今年除了把原有四万亩沟坪地作为“基本农田”，集中力量增施肥料精耕细作外，并采取革命措施，在沟中打坝漫地，沟上停耕坡地还草还林，新漫了沟地五万亩。通过边打坝、边砌土垫沟、边播种，有三万亩新沟地当年就收获秋粮四千余万斤。在停耕的坡地上已造林十四万亩，种牧草二万亩，长期以来荒凉的大自然面貌今年发生了变化。
    最近中共县委又提出了征服自然的宏愿，决定明年达到亩产小麦五千斤、亩产秋粮万斤县，把农业生产大跃进的红旗插的更高。
