    Education Combined with Labor, a Myriad of Vibrant Colors
    ——On the "Exhibition of the Combination of Education and Productive Labor"
    Jiangsu: Rich and Colorful New Products and Handicrafts
    Schools in Jiangsu Province are vigorously engaged in industrial and agricultural production, turning schools into factories and farms, and students into workers and farmers. According to statistics from 763 schools by the end of August, over 97% of students participated in work-study programs, accumulating more than 37,450,000 workdays in over half a year. Schools reclaimed wasteland and established 334 farms, cultivating 64,670 mu of land; they also established 6,278 factories. They also established fixed connections with 1,619 agricultural cooperatives, 1,289 factories, and 393 handicraft cooperatives.
    Through work-study programs and part-work part-study, students' minds have been liberated, and various high-yield experimental fields and new products have emerged. The dairy cows at Jurong Agricultural School produce 140.25 jin of milk per day; the chicken and goose breeding at Shiyang Middle School are both creative products. Among the 2,606 scientific research new products, the analog computer from Nanjing Institute of Technology and two other schools, the "Maksutov" telescope from Nanjing University, and the telephone secretary from Nanjing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications have all reached higher domestic levels. Nanjing Aeronautical Institute used all-domestic materials to make an aerial target drone in two months. Gu Xitu and three other students from Wuxi No. 3 Middle School worked hard for three months, failing over a hundred times, and finally trial-produced a wool fiber separator, which can increase work efficiency by 150 times.
    According to local conditions and students' age characteristics, schools in Jiangsu have produced many very exquisite handicrafts with local characteristics. In the exhibition hall, you can see Wuxi's enamel and clay figurines, Yixing's pottery, Suzhou's textiles and embroidery, Yangzhou's velvet flowers, Changzhou's combs, Yizheng's rush mats, and Gaochun's goose feather fans. In addition, there are fishing nets, bamboo wares, nylon gloves, and doll toys, which are truly rich and colorful, a feast for the eyes. You can also see Wang Xiawen, a student from Guangfu Junior Middle School in Wuxian County, Gu Xiubao, a student from Jiangsu Silk School, Shi Yilan and Zhou Xiuying, students from Yizheng Rush Mat Middle School, and Yu Chengque, a student from Suzhou High School, demonstrating embroidery, silk weaving, mat weaving, and straw rope making on the spot.
    Guangdong: Products with Subtropical Characteristics
    Guangdong is located in the subtropical zone, so the work-study products of various types of schools at all levels have subtropical characteristics. As soon as you enter the exhibition room of industrial and agricultural products in the Guangdong Pavilion, you can see many rubber products, including high-quality transparent rubber tubes, biogas rubber tubes, universal tractor tires, anti-odor rubber shoes, and various rubber gloves. The comprehensive utilization of sweet potatoes, sugarcane, and fruits is also eye-catching. Once sweet potatoes are comprehensively utilized, potato residue can be used to make starch, juice to make sugar, vines to make cotton, and leaves to make fertilizer, producing a total of fourteen products including anhydrous alcohol, dextrin, and sweet potato juice syrup. Sugarcane can be used to make thirty-two products, including 100% sugarcane bagasse cement bags, cellulose, and plastic powder. The peels of fruits such as bananas and pineapples can also be utilized to produce pineapple enzymes and pectin that exceed international standards. Students also personally cultivate various subtropical fruits, as well as citronella, oil palm, coffee, and other subtropical crops, seedless tomatoes, and the internationally renowned Shipai black tea. Students from the Sericulture Department of South China Agricultural College worked day and night, taking turns caring for silkworm eggs, and as a result, they cultivated the improved silkworm variety "South China Agricultural No. 7" and researched maple tree sericulture, allowing northern silkworms to move south.
    In the scientific research product exhibition room of the Guangdong Pavilion, there are analog computers, semiconductor microammeters, radio frequency bridges, frequency meters, aluminum wire butt welding, "E605" pesticide that exceeds the German level, and 99.99% purity tungsten refined by indigenous methods that reaches the international level. Among them, aluminum wire butt welding with a diameter of 0.8 mm is an unresolved problem internationally, but students from the Physics Department of Zhongshan University, with the help of factory workers, broke superstitions and finally succeeded in welding. The materials for preventing and controlling termites researched by the nationally famous "native expert" Li Shimei are also on display here.
    Anhui: Serving the Three Marshals
    Schools in various parts of Anhui actively serve the three marshals. Hefei University of Technology (formerly Hefei Mining Institute) runs a joint iron and steel enterprise with an annual output of 100,000 tons of steel. Secondary schools and above throughout the province, including some primary schools, have universally carried out iron and steel production. They used indigenous blast furnaces, indigenous furnaces, and small crucibles to produce manganese steel, silicon steel, high carbon steel, and white pig iron.
    In order to prepare "food and fodder" for the steel marshal, teachers and students of universities and colleges actively engaged in the production of coke, refractory bricks, and cement. Taiping Road No. 3 Primary School in Bengbu City built a coke oven with a monthly output of 200 tons, producing high-quality first-class coke.
    In terms of agricultural production, secondary schools in Anqing Prefecture planted 296.6 mu of early rice, achieving an average yield of 1,969.96 jin per mu over a large area. Huangkou Middle School in Xiaoxian County successfully trial-planted rice in sandy and saline-alkali land that had never been able to grow rice, and obtained yields of over a thousand jin.
    Teachers and students of major universities and middle schools in Anhui are determined to plant the red flag on the scientific frontier. The Geology Department of Hefei University of Technology successfully trial-produced vertical rock castings. They also made new-style instruments such as heavy liquid elevators, automatic gas alarms, and coal conveyors that directly serve production, some of which are domestically pioneered and some of which have approached or exceeded international levels. The germanium ingots trial-produced by Hefei University of Technology have reached seven "9s," and they have also trial-produced a silicon transistor. The quality of metallic lithium and anhydrous aluminum trichloride trial-produced by Anhui Normal College has exceeded that of the United Kingdom.
    Shandong: Marching Towards the Ocean
    Shandong is located on the coast, and in terms of scientific research, marching towards the ocean is an important local characteristic. The Shandong Pavilion exhibits Shandong University's kelp cultivation. This research solves the problem of kelp preservation and increases production by a hundred times. The comprehensive utilization of kelp, such as mannitol, iodine, xenylon, and kelp battery lamps, is valuable. In the field of hydroacoustics, there are ultrasonic transmitters made of barium titanate, which can be used to detect ships, fish schools, etc. at sea; there are piezoelectric crystals; in addition, standard seawater and reversing water samplers have reached international levels.
    Almost all major universities and middle schools in Shandong have established factories, and rural schools generally have established farms. Here, Zibo No. 5 Middle School is exhibiting its record of producing 152 tons of iron per day; Zibo No. 6 Middle School has established a joint iron and steel enterprise, including mining, coking, ironmaking, and steelmaking, and has created indigenous crucible steelmaking methods; Qingdao Architectural Engineering School has researched and produced No. 477 slag-free cement; Qingdao Rubber School produces thermosetting rubber in fifteen minutes; there is Shandong Institute of Technology's branch calculation table, analog computer, automatic alignment instrument, etc.
    Zhejiang: Schools Vigorously Run Factories and Farms
    Various types of schools at all levels in Zhejiang run 27,760 factories. The products exhibited in the Zhejiang Pavilion include iron and steel, machinery, electrical machinery, civil engineering, chemical industry, silk, and handicrafts.
    Here are Zhejiang University's three-phase asynchronous motor, nickel-free magnetic steel, permanent magnet iron sand separator, etc. supporting the steel industry. Slag-free cement and flat glass mirrors have reached or exceeded international levels. Two kinds of silk fabrics from Hangzhou Textile College have reached international levels and are sold to more than 50 countries.
    Schools run 46,550 mu of farms. Yongjia Middle School has been persisting in work-study activities for several years, and more than 80% of the students have mastered field operations, 15% of the students have become production experts, and their average weight has increased by 11%. The Michurin group of Jiaokou Primary School in Yuqian County grew sunflower seeds as big as broad beans and was praised by Premier Zhou. In the past four years, young scientists have cultivated 25 new varieties.
    From the exhibition, people can see the situation of factories and people's communes in Zhejiang running schools on a large scale. Now, all factories have established spare-time schools or vocational schools. Under the leadership of the Party committee, Hangzhou General Machinery Factory established a spare-time university in a few days, which greatly encouraged the learning enthusiasm of the workers. Mao Zhixun, a former illiterate and today's university student, used the scientific knowledge he learned to improve many tools, including improving a thread rolling machine, increasing work efficiency by 70 times.
    Qinghai: Education Soars to the Sky
    Qinghai is a multi-ethnic region, and the education cause was extremely backward. When it was liberated in the autumn of 1949, there were only eight secondary schools with 1,388 students, and only 717 primary schools with 40,540 students, on this cold land of 820,000 square kilometers; there were no institutions of higher learning at all.
    In the past few years since liberation, the education cause has developed greatly. 1958 was a year of great leap forward. By the beginning of September, the number of institutions of higher learning had grown from two established in 1956 with 165 students to seven with 3,402 students, and 390 spare-time universities with 31,470 students had been established. This summer, the first batch of college students graduated from Qinghai Province. The number of secondary schools has soared to 1,557. The number of primary schools has increased more than threefold compared to 1949, the number of students has increased 6.5 times, and the enrollment rate of school-age children has reached 92.9%. 63.4% of the young and middle-aged illiterate people in the province have been eliminated from illiteracy, and eight counties and cities have basically eliminated illiteracy. Kindergartens have jumped from two with 320 children in 1949 to 8,236, with 121,805 children enrolled.
    Before liberation, the minority people in the Qinghai area had no opportunity to receive education at all. There was not a single school for the Mongolian, Tibetan, Kazakh, and other ethnic groups. The Qinghai Pavilion shows that after liberation, the national education of Qinghai has rapidly leaped forward at an unprecedented speed. At present, a total of 13 middle schools, 7 normal schools, and 798 primary schools have been established, with an enrollment rate of 76.5% for school-age children. Qinghai Nationalities University has also been established. The educational backwardness caused by the minority nationalities in history will never return.
    The vast number of teachers and students in Qinghai Province have gone to the countryside and mountains to participate in labor training, plant experimental fields, and vigorously run factories and farms. Productive labor has been officially included in the education plan and has become a compulsory course for students. For example, teachers and students of Xining Industrial School went to the mountains to mine copper in April this year. By the end of August, they had mined a total of 6,000 tons of copper, completing 500% of the annual plan, and had refined 3,800 jin of crude copper. They also opened a lead-zinc mine. Teachers and students of Qinghai Water Conservancy School participated in the construction of water conservancy projects with 3,719 kilometers of canals and 130 reservoirs, which can irrigate 1,638,299 mu of land. At the beginning of September, schools invested in the iron and steel front. Qinghai Normal College alone built 14 indigenous blast furnaces.
    Gansu: Adding Fuel and Water to Socialism
    Gansu is the earliest oil producing area in the motherland. In the Gansu Pavilion, it can be seen that the Yumen Petroleum Workers Technical School organized drilling teams and oil production teams and established a small indigenous oil refinery in carrying out work-study activities. It has already refined a total of 4,103 kilograms of gasoline, kerosene, and diesel oil, and will produce 25,000 tons of oil annually in the future to support national construction. In terms of scientific research, 48 products from various colleges and universities have reached or exceeded international levels. Rare earth element compounds such as thorium nitrate, lithium carbonate, and beryllium oxide from Lanzhou University are important raw materials for the atomic energy industry; the rare earth element selenium is a semiconductor raw material; magnetic materials such as manganese bismuth alloy and copper zinc ferrite have reached international levels or exceeded British and American levels. Lu Keyuan, a school doctor at Lintao Agricultural School, made "Eagle Eye Tissue Fluid," which has enabled several patients who had been blind for one to three years to regain their sight.
    The Introduction to Tao River Project is a large-scale project, and all major colleges and universities in the province have invested their strength. Teachers and students of the Geography Department of Northwest Normal College completed the survey project of the Tenth Trunk Canal; Gansu Water Conservancy School took the construction site as the school and the project as the teaching material, and participated in surveying, construction and some simple design work. The total trunk canals, canals, route alignments, highways, and railways measured were more than 880 kilometers, including the most difficult section of the Introduction to Tao River Project, from Xiadawo to Jiudianxia, ​​32 kilometers long.
    Here is also a special introduction to the banner of work-study – Jiuquan Middle School.

    教育结合劳动  百花万紫千红
    ——在“教育与生产劳动相结合展览会”上
    江　苏：丰富多采的新产品和手工艺品
    江苏省各学校大搞工农业生产，使学校变成了工厂、农场，学生变成了工人、农民。据七百六十三所学校于8月底统计，97％以上的学生参加了勤工俭学，半年多来已做劳动日三千七百四十五万个。各校开荒辟野，大办农场三百三十四个，耕地六万四千六百七十亩；大办工厂六千二百七十八个。他们还同一千六百一十九个农业社、一千二百八十九个工厂和三百九十三个手工业社建立了固定联系。
    通过勤工俭学与半工半读，学生们的思想得到解放，出现了各种高产试验田和新产品。句容农业学校的乳牛一天产乳一四零点二五斤；时阳中学的鸡鹅配种，都是创造性的产品。在二千六百零六种科学研究新产品中，有南京工学院等三校的模拟式电子计算机，南京大学的“马克苏托夫”式望远镜，南京邮电学院的电话秘书等都达到国内较高水平。南京航空学院全部用国产材料在两个月里制成了航空靶机。无锡市三中学生顾锡土等四人苦干三个月，失败过百余次，最后试制成了羊毛纤维分离机，可以提高工效一百五十倍。
    江苏各学校根据当地情况和学生年龄特点，制出了富有地方特色的非常精致的许多手工艺品。在展览馆可以看到无锡的搪瓷、泥人，宜兴的陶器，苏州的纺织、刺绣，扬州的绒花，常州的篦子，仪征的扑席，高淳的鹅毛扇。此外还有鱼网、竹器、尼龙手套、娃娃玩具等，真是丰富多采，琳琅满目。还可以看到吴县光福初中学生王霞文、江苏丝绸学校学生顾秀宝、仪征扑席中学学生施贻兰和周秀英、苏州高中学生俞承悫的刺绣、织绸、织席、打草绳等现场操作。
    广东：产品带有亚热带特点
    广东处于亚热带，因此，各级各类学校勤工俭学的产品带有亚热带的特点。一走进广东馆工农业产品的展览室，就可以看到很多橡胶制品，水平很高的透明胶管、沼气胶管、万能拖拉机轮胎、防臭胶鞋和各种胶手套等。甘薯、甘蔗、水果等的综合利用，也是引人注目的。甘薯一经综合利用，薯渣可制淀粉，汁制糖，藤制棉，叶又做肥料，一共制出无水酒精、糊精、薯汁糖浆等十四种产品；甘蔗可制出三十二种产品，其中有100％甘蔗渣水泥袋纸、纤维素、塑料粉等；香蕉、菠萝等水果的果皮也可加以利用，并制出超国际水平的菠萝酵素、果胶等。学生还亲手培植各种亚热带水果，以及香茅草、油棕、咖啡等亚热带作物、无核西红柿和享有国际声誉的石牌红茶。华南农学院蚕桑系学生日夜苦战，轮班照顾蚕种，结果培养出了良种蚕“南农七号”，并且研究出枫树养蚕，让北蚕南移。
    在广东馆科学研究成品展览室，陈列了模拟式电子计算机、半导体微电流计、射频电桥、频率计、铝线对焊焊接、超德国水平的“E605”农药和达到国际水平的土法炼出的纯度99.99％的钨等。其中直径在零点八毫米的铝线对焊焊接是国际上未解决的问题，但是中山大学物理系学生在工厂工人帮助下，破除迷信，终于焊接成功。全国著名的“土专家”李始美研究防治白蚁的材料也在这里展览出来。
    安徽：为三大元帅服务
    安徽各地学校积极为三大元帅服务。合肥工业大学（原合肥矿业学院）举办了年产十万吨钢的钢铁联合企业。全省中等以上学校包括有些小学都普遍进行了钢铁生产，他们采用土高炉、土炉子、小坩锅，炼出了锰钢、釸钢、高碳钢、白口铁。
    为了给钢帅准备“粮草”，高等学校师生还积极进行焦炭、耐火砖和水泥的生产。蚌埠市太平路第三小学建成了月产二百吨的炼焦炉，炼出了质量优良的一等焦。
    在农业生产方面，安庆专区中等学校种了二百九十六点六亩早稻，获得平均亩产一千九百六十九点九六斤的大面积丰收。肖县黄口中学在一向不能种水稻的砂地和盐碱地里试种水稻成功，并获得千斤以上的产量。
    安徽各大、中学校师生决心把红旗插上科学尖端。合肥工业大学地质系试制立式岩铸件成功，他们还制成重液提升、自动瓦斯警报器、输煤器等直接为生产服务的新式器械，有些是国内首创，有些已接近或超过国际水平。合肥工业大学试制的锗锭已达到七个“9”，他们还试制了一种硅晶体管；安徽师范学院试制的金属锂、无水三氯化铝质量都已超过英国。
    山东：向海洋进军
    山东地处海岸，在科学研究方面，向海洋进军是一个重要的地方特色。在山东馆展出了山东大学的海带养殖，这项研究解决了海带防腐问题，并提高产量一百倍；海带的综合利用，如甘露醇、碘、赛尼龙、海带电池灯等，都有价值。在水声学方面，有用钛酸钡制成的超声波发射头，可以用来在海上探测舰只、鱼群等；有压电性晶体；另外标准海水、颠倒采水器等都达到了国际水平。
    山东各大中学校几乎都办起了工厂，农村的学校一般都办起了农场。在这里，展出淄博五中创造日产铁一百五十二吨的纪录；淄博六中办起了钢铁联合企业，包括开矿、炼焦、炼铁、炼钢，并且创造了土法坩锅炼钢；青岛建筑工程学校研究出四百七十七标号的石灰矿渣无熟料水泥；青岛橡胶学校以十五分钟制出热素炼胶；有山东工学院的支流计算台、模拟电子计算机、自动整步仪等。
    浙江：学校大办工厂农场
    浙江各级各类学校办工厂二万七千七百六十所。在浙江馆展出的产品，有钢铁、机械、电机、土木、化工、丝绸和手工业工艺品等。
    这里有浙江大学支援钢铁工业的三相异步电动机、无镍磁钢、永磁式铁砂分离器等。矿渣无熟料水泥和玻璃平镜都达到或超过国际水平。杭州纺织专科学校有两种绸缎已达到国际水平，外销五十多国。
    各学校办农场四万六千五百五十亩。永嘉中学几年来一直坚持勤工俭学活动，已有80％以上的学生掌握了田间操作，15％的学生成了生产能手，体重平均增长11％。于潜县交口小学的米丘林小组，种出了像蚕豆一样大的葵花子，曾受到周总理的赞扬。四年多来，少年科学家们已培育出二十五种新品种。
    从展览会上，人们可以看到浙江各工厂、人民公社大办学校的情况。现在，各工厂都办起了业余学校或职业学校。杭州通用机器厂在党委的领导下，几天内办起了一所业余大学，大大鼓舞了职工的学习情绪。解放前的文盲，今天的大学生——茅志勋，运用学到的科学知识改进了不少工具，其中改进了一台搓丝机，提高工作效率七十倍。
    青海：教育事业一飞冲天
    青海是一个多民族的地方，原来教育事业极端落后。1949年秋解放时，在这块八十二万平方公里的高寒土地上，仅有八所中等学校，学生一千三百八十八名；小学只有七百一十七所，学生四万零五百四十名；高等学校根本没有。
    解放几年来，教育事业有了很大的发展。1958年是大跃进的一年，到9月初，高等学校已经由1956年建立的两所、学生一百六十五人，发展到七所、学生三千四百零二人，并建立了业余大学三百九十所、学生三万一千四百七十人。今年夏天青海省高等学校第一批大学生毕业了。中等学校猛增到一千五百五十七所。小学校数比1949年增加三倍多，学生增加六点五倍，学龄儿童入学率达92.9％。全省已有63.4％的青壮年文盲脱盲，有八个县市基本上扫除了文盲。幼儿园由1949年的两所、儿童三百二十名，一跃而为八千二百三十六所，入托儿童已达一十二万一千八百零五人。
    青海地区的少数民族人民，解放前根本没有受教育的机会，蒙、藏、哈萨克等民族一所学校也没有。青海馆表明，解放后，青海的民族教育以空前的速度飞快跃进。目前共办起中学十三所，师范七所，小学七百九十八所，学龄儿童入学率达76.5％，还办起了青海民族学院。少数民族在历史上造成的教育落后状态，将一去不复返了。
    青海省广大师生纷纷下乡上山参加劳动锻炼，种试验田，大办工厂农场，生产劳动已正式列入教育计划，成为学生的必修课。如西宁市工业学校师生今年4月到深山中采矿炼铜，到8月底共开采铜六千吨，完成年计划的500％，并已炼出粗铜三千八百斤，另外还开了一个铅锌矿。青海水利学校师生参加了三千七百一十九公里的水渠和一百三十个水库可灌田一百六十三万八千二百九十九亩的水利修建工程。9月初各校投入钢铁战线，仅青海师范学院一校即建起土高炉十四座。
    甘肃：为社会主义加油引水
    甘肃是祖国最早的石油产地。在甘肃馆可以看到，玉门石油工人技术学校在开展勤工俭学活动中，组织了钻井队和采油队，建立了小型土法炼油厂，已经炼出汽油、煤油、柴油共四千一百零三公斤，今后每年生产二万五千吨石油，支援国家建设。在科学研究方面，目前各院校已有四十八项产品达到或超过国际水平。兰州大学的稀有元素化合物硝酸钍、碳酸锂、氧化铍等都是原子能工业的重要原料；稀有元素硒是半导体原料；锰铋合金、铜锌铁氧体等磁性材料都达到国际水平或超过英美水平。临洮农校校医逯克元制成的“鹰眼组织液”已经使几个失明一年到三年的患者重见光明。
    引洮工程是一项规模宏大的工程，全省各大、专学校都投入了力量。西北师范学院地理系的师生们完成了第十干渠的勘测工程；甘肃水利学校以工地为学校，以工程为教材，参加了测量、施工和一些简单的设计工作，测量的总干渠、干渠、定线、公路、铁路等有八百八十多公里，其中有引洮工程中最艰险的下达窝至九奠峡一段三十二公里。
    这里还专门介绍了勤工俭学的一面旗帜——酒泉中学。
