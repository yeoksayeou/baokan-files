The Iron Girls Battle the Barren Sands
Zhao Fengling, Jiahe Hongfeng Brigade, Shou Zhang People's Commune, Shandong

There are five of us: Zhao Jirong, Lu Huanling, Cheng Fengyun, Zhao Yumei, and me. Everyone calls us the "Iron Girls." Zhao Jirong is 16 years old, and the four of us are 17 years old, all from poor peasant families. How did the name "Iron Girls" come about? It's because we five fought the sandy wasteland for three years, finally achieving victory, turning over more than a hundred mu of land, and creating high-yield satellites on the sandy wasteland.

In the past, Jiahe was a sandy wasteland area. "Without wind, three feet of dust; with wind, half the sky; in windy weather, you can't see anyone; it's hard to open your eyes when you go out; the doors are closed when the wind blows, and dirt comes in through the cracks; you eat with a pot over your food, swallowing dirt and rice together." What good crops can grow in this kind of land? Even in a good year, each mu would yield no more than forty or fifty jin of grain. After collectivization, the Party called on everyone to "change the face of the sandy wasteland and turn the land over," mobilizing all commune members to launch an attack on the sandy wasteland. The branch secretary, at the Party and Youth League meeting, called on Party and Youth League members to take the lead. At that time, only Jirong and I were Youth League members. We were determined to be at the forefront, persuaded our families to overcome their objections, and mobilized Huanling, Fengyun, and Yumei, who we had been close to since childhood. With the permission of the team committee, we five formed the "Five-Person Land Reclamation Shock Team" and stepped onto the battlefield of the great battle against the sandy wasteland.

In Jiahe, it is necessary to turn over two meters of drifting sand and dig out good soil before crops can grow. A strong young man, working from dawn to dusk, can only turn over three li of land a day. We five planned to turn over eleven mu in the first winter. In the first few days, because the ditches were deep, we were small, and we worked hard, we inevitably suffered from back pain, leg soreness, and our arms could not lift the shovels, and the blisters on our hands formed strings. We were not afraid of any of this. Thinking of the Party's teachings, we felt full of energy. When we couldn't throw the soil up, we created the method of "people linked to people, shovels linked to shovels, one bend after another" to turn the soil up. When we got blisters on our hands, we wrapped the shovel handles with handkerchiefs and continued to work. To avoid our families' objections, we always kept our hands in our sleeves when we got home, so our elders wouldn't see the blood on our hands. We didn't go home except for meals, working day after day, without rest, and no one felt tired. Every day, as soon as it was light, we went to the construction site, and the commune members called us "Morning Crows." At night, we worked overtime to turn the land. Without a watch, we didn't go home until the late stars fell.

One night, it snowed heavily, the snow was knee-deep, and the ground was frozen solid. The commune members didn't want to go to the fields. At this time, we five, carrying shovels and brooms, first cleared a small path from the village entrance to the construction site. When the ground was hard to turn, we used steel chisels to break through the hard layer and continue to turn the land. The north wind chapped our hands, and the hammers caused them to bleed, but no one made a sound. We even made up a rhyme: "Little wind, little snow, no rest; big wind, big snow, take a week off; not afraid of cold weather or frozen ground; steel chisel and hammer break it down." As a result, the commune members who didn't want to go to the fields also went.

In the three years of battling the sandy wasteland, we also encountered many dangers. One time, on October 19th last year, we and the male youth shock team from our team launched a competition. We wanted to surpass them in quality, and we were so busy digging that we didn't look around. Unexpectedly, with a "boom," the ditch collapsed again, and Fengyun and Jirong were buried in the ditch. After they were pulled out, Fengyun took a puff of a cigarette to catch her breath; Jirong's arm was broken. The three of us cried. But Jirong didn't even groan. Instead, she said, "I'll be fine. What are you crying for? Go back to turning the land." Jirong's father is the Party branch secretary, and she was usually influenced by him. Although she was seriously injured, her determination to conquer the sandy wasteland did not waver. Even though she was injured and couldn't go to the fields, she was still worried about turning the land all day long. She even talked about turning the land in her sleep. We four were greatly influenced by her spirit. We also worked with her until our legs ached without complaining of fatigue, were not afraid of the cold in the freezing weather, did not stop working when it snowed, did not groan when bones broke, and did not cry when we bled. Therefore, the masses began to call us the five Iron Girls. For three years, we five have turned over more than 100 mu of land and have not bowed our heads in the face of the "difficulty" paper tiger, forcibly turning the sandy wasteland into fertile land.

"Iron Girls have firm aspirations, working hard to create high yields; girls' hearts, tiger's courage, manage crops like tending a garden, sitting and watching the seedlings grow, to send satellites into the sky; today's heroes surpass hundreds of generations, winning the champion in Tiananmen Square." This is our slogan and determination for achieving high yields. In this year's Great Leap Forward, we began to plan for a yield of 200,000 jin per mu for big sweet potatoes and 10,000 jin for big corn. At that time, not only did the masses not believe it, but even our deputy team leader, Lu Huiqing, did not support us. He said, "You few can't do it. You have no experience. Don't do it." An old man named Xue, stroking his beard, said, "You few yellow-haired girls are simply trying to reach the sky. If one mu of land can yield 10,000 jin, I'll tear off my head and let you play ball with it!" Someone said, "Anyway, it doesn't cost anything to talk big...."

The deputy team leader didn't support us, and the backward masses ridiculed us. Our five thoughts were not very unified. Zhao Yumei once said, "We are too bold! Let's do less this year and more next year!" But Zhao Jirong was very determined. She said to us, "We must run ahead of the Party's call. No one believes in anything new. No one has ever harvested 10,000 jin per mu. We must do it...." So, we went to the Party branch secretary! The Party branch secretary educated and strengthened our confidence and supported us in achieving high yields. He also sent Deputy Team Leader Liu Kaizhong as our technical advisor, and he also criticized Deputy Team Leader Lu Huiqing. In May, it hadn't rained for forty days, and the sweet potatoes were withered and yellow. Because the water source was not sufficient at that time after conquering the sandy wasteland, we were worried. At this time, Wang Anzhong, the secretary of the management district's Youth League Committee, personally educated us on overcoming difficulties and helped us think of ways. Therefore, Jirong led us to carry water from nearby water pits and wells for three days and two nights, finally watering six mu of sweet potatoes and spring corn and soybeans. Although our shoulders were swollen, no one cried out in pain. When we were really tired, we sang a song.

As soon as the drought was suppressed, the corn and sweet potatoes were infested with insects. We didn't eat for a day, and we killed all the insects. The canteen cook found out that we hadn't eaten and brought the food to the field. We ate and treated the insects at the same time. Our determination is: to share the same breath and destiny with the crops! Before the crops were harvested, the observers and calculators were convinced when they saw the corn cobs as thick as arms. Especially the old man Xue, he blushed when he saw us. When the spring corn, peanuts, and soybeans were harvested, it was so lively! Comrades from the prefectural and county committees and commune members participated in the acceptance. Old man Xue Shouye also participated. Finally, it was verified that the yield of spring corn was more than 12,000 jin per mu. Old man Xue's neck was as red as a piece of red cloth, and he muttered, "I lost this game. I have eyes but couldn't see Mount Tai. I'm convinced this time."

You see, aren't all difficulties paper tigers? If you are soft, it will be hard. If you are hard, it will be soft. That's just the way it is.

    铁姑娘大战荒砂
    山东寿张人民公社夹河洪峰大队　赵凤岭
    我们五个人：赵继荣、卢焕岭、程凤云、赵玉梅和我，大家管我们叫“铁姑娘”。赵继荣16岁，我们四人都是17岁，都是贫农出身的女孩子。“铁姑娘”这名称是怎么叫起来的呢？是因为我们五人和沙荒打了三年的交手仗，终于取得了胜利，使百余亩土地来了个大翻身，并且在沙荒地上创造了高产卫星。
    过去夹河是一个沙荒地区。无风三尺土，有风半个天，风天不见人，出门难睁眼，刮风关着门，土从门缝钻，吃饭盖着锅，土饭一齐咽。这种土地长得出什么好庄稼？收成好，一年每亩也不过收四、五十斤粮食。合作化后，党号召大家“让沙荒改貌，叫土地翻身”，动员全体社员向沙荒展开攻击。支部书记在党、团员大会上，号召党、团员必须起到带头作用。当时只有我和继荣是团员，我们俩下定了决心，一定冲锋在前，说服了家庭的阻拦，动员了我们从小要好的焕岭、凤云、玉梅出来，经队委会允许，我们五个成立了“五人翻地突击组”，走上了大战沙荒的战场。
    夹河的地，必须翻二公尺多厚的飞沙，挖出好土来，才能长庄稼，干这样的活，一个挺棒的小伙子起早贪晚，一天不过翻三厘多地，俺五人头一冬计划翻十一亩。开始的几天，因壕子深，个子小，加上干的猛，总是免不了腰疼、腿酸，胳膊举不起锨，手上磨的水泡连成了串。这些我们都没怕，想起党的教导，浑身就长了劲。扔不上土来，俺就创造了“人连人，锨连锨，一弯倒一弯”的办法，将土翻上来，手上磨了泡，就用手绢缠上锨把继续干，为了避免家庭的阻挡，到家总是袖着手，不叫老人看见手上流血。每天除吃饭外，也不回家，一天天的干，一会不休息，谁也不觉累。每天，天刚发亮，就到工地，社员都叫俺“打明鸡”；晚上加班翻地，没有表，等荒忙星落了才回家。
    一天夜里，下了大雪，雪深膝盖，地冻的当当响，社员都不想下地了。这时，俺五个扛锨的扛锨，拿扫帚的拿扫帚，先打扫了一条从村口通向工地的小道。地翻不动，就用钢镢砸，突破硬层，继续翻地，手被北风吹的裂了口子，油锤一震，流出了鲜血，可是谁也不哼声，自己还编了个顺口溜：“小风小雪不休息，大风大雪过星期，天冷地冻都不怕，钢镢油锤砸下去。”这样一来，不想下地的社员也下地了。
    我们在大战沙荒的三年中，也遭受过不少危险。有一次是去年10月19日，俺们和本队的男青年突击队开展了竞赛，想从质量上超过他们，光顾的挖未顾看，不料“轰”的一声壕子又塌了，凤云和继荣给砸到壕子里了。扒出后，凤云抽袋烟的工夫才缓过气来；继荣胳膊砸断了，我们三个哇的一气哭了，可是继荣连哼也没哼一声，反说：“我会好的，你们哭什么，还不翻地去。”继荣的父亲是党支书，平常受了他的影响，虽然受了重伤，一点也没动摇战胜沙荒的决心。她受了伤不能下地，还成天惦记着翻地，夜间说梦话，也在翻地。我们四人，看到她这种骨气，受到了很大影响，我们也和她一起作到了腿酸不嫌累，冰天不嫌冷，下雪不停工，骨断不哼声，流血不叫疼。因此群众就开始管我们叫五个铁姑娘了。三年以来，我们五个人翻了一百多亩地，没有在“困难”这个纸老虎面前低头，硬叫沙荒变成了良田。
    “铁姑娘志气坚，苦干苦钻创高产；姑娘心，老虎胆，管理庄稼如种园，坐阵看着苗子长，要把卫星送上天；今朝英雄胜百代，天安门上夺状元。”这是我们搞高产的口号和决心。在今年大跃进里，我们开始计划搞亩产二十万斤的大地瓜和万斤的大玉米，当时别说群众不相信，就连俺的副队长卢会青也不支持，他说：“您几个不行，没经验别搞了。”有一位薛老大爷吹着胡子说：“你们这几个黄毛丫头，简直想上天，要是一亩地能收一万斤，我就揪下头来，叫您当球玩！”有人说：“反正是说大话不纳税……。”
    副队长不支持，落后的群众讽刺，我们五个的思想也不很统一，赵玉梅曾说：“咱的胆太大啦！今年少搞点，明年再多搞吧！”可是赵继荣的决心很大，她对俺几个说：“党的号召咱就得跑到前头，啥新事落后人也不相信，过去一亩地没收过一万斤，咱就非干不可……。”这样，俺几个就找党支部书记去啦！党支书一面教育坚定了我们的信心，一面支持我们搞高产，还派了副队长刘开忠当我们的技术顾问，他还批评了副队长卢会青。到了5月里，四十天未下一场透雨，地瓜旱的黄巴巴的，因战胜沙荒后，当时水源还不很足，我们几人也发了愁，这时管理区团委书记王安忠同志亲自对我们进行了克服困难的教育，还帮助我们想了办法，因此，继荣领我们在周围较近的水坑、水井里挑水一气干了三天两夜，终于把六亩地瓜和春玉米、大豆浇了一遍。虽然肩膀磨肿了，但谁也不叫疼，实在累了，就唱个歌。
    旱象刚压下去，玉米、地瓜又生了虫子，我们一天没吃饭，一气把虫子打光了，食堂炊事员发现我们没吃饭，把饭送到地里，我们就边吃边治虫。我们的决心是：和庄稼同呼吸共命运！庄稼没到收割，观潮派、算账派，看到跟胳膊一样粗的玉米棒，就服输了。特别是薛老大爷，看见我们就脸红。春玉米、花生、大豆收割时，可热闹啦！参加验收的有地委、县委的同志，也有社员，薛守业老汉也参加了，最后核定春玉米亩产一万二千多斤，薛老大爷连脖子都和大红布一样，喃喃地说：“我这盘棋输了，我有眼不识泰山，这回可服气了。”
    您瞧，什么困难不全是纸老虎吗？你软它就硬，你硬它就软，反正就是那么一回事。
