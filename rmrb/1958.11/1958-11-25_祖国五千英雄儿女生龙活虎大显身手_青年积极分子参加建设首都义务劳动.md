Xinhua News Agency, 24th - Nearly five thousand young people attending the National Congress of Young Activists demonstrated their great skills on four construction sites in the capital today, gloriously participating in voluntary labor to build the capital with soaring energy like dragons and tigers.

Liu Xiyuan, Luo Yi, Hu Keshi, and other secretaries of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, labored alongside the young activists.

This morning, the temperature in the capital was around zero degrees Celsius, but these young men and women, filled with fiery enthusiasm for labor, completely forgot that it was early winter. Many people took off their cotton clothes and even shoes and socks as soon as they entered the construction site, standing in the mud and water to work. Everyone was in high spirits, full of energy, carrying earth and transporting sand, moving quickly. After a period of intense labor, some people were sweating profusely, their hair covered in ice.

On each construction site, young activists formed shock brigades or combat teams named after heroes such as "Huang Jiguang," "Liu Hulan," "Zhao Yiman," and "Ding Youjun." They appeared as shock troops in this labor army, becoming the most active collectives on the construction site. On the Tiananmen Square construction site, young people from sixteen ethnic groups formed a "National Unity" shock brigade, led by Li Laoda, a Communist Party member and twenty-year-old Hani youth. His left arm was blown off in an accident this spring when he was working as a blaster in water conservancy projects. Today, this "one-armed hero" was wearing only a single layer of clothing, carrying earth back and forth quickly. Hong Shunli, a militia hero from the Fujian coastal defense front, Cai Yushuang, a model of supporting the front, and He Danian, a "little Eighth Route Army soldier," and fifteen others formed a militia shock brigade. Their shovels moved non-stop, their carts ran like flying, and they completed ninety cubic meters of earth in three hours, averaging more than two cubic meters per person per hour. Among the young activists from Sichuan, there was an "Eleven Sisters Shock Brigade," all girls around twenty years old, who worked like tigers. In less than two hours, they transported more than one hundred loads of earth over a distance of more than one hundred and fifty meters.

Many young activists regarded the construction site as a competition arena, and they launched enthusiastic labor competitions with each other. Among the young activists from Heilongjiang Province, a "Mu Guiying" platoon organized by fourteen young women, and a "Wu Song" shock brigade organized by twenty-eight young men, launched a four-hour competition. Young activists from the People's Liberation Army, like dragons and tigers, launched a labor competition with the workers on the construction site today. Xu Hengzhun, the representative of the Second Class Merit Company of a certain artillery unit, led a brick-carrying shock group, averaging 1,200 bricks per person per hour, exceeding the previous brick-carrying record on this construction site by three times. The workers were not to be outdone. Young workers Meng Fanxiang and Han Shuanglin also led shock groups to chase after them. When the carrying poles broke, they replaced them, and soon caught up with Xu Hengzhun's group.

In the labor competition, the communist spirit of cooperation among the young activists shone brightly. They not only had the ambition to surpass their competitors, but also took the initiative to support other collectives. Zhang Youdao, who had won the title of Model for Harnessing the Huai River eighteen times, led the "Rocket" shock brigade, and Ma Yulan, who improved work efficiency by twenty-seven times a day on the Zilu Lake construction site in Anhui by reforming earth transportation methods, led the "Hua Mulan" shock brigade, launched a competition for work efficiency. The results of this competition were similar, and both completed their tasks in two and a half hours. They immediately took the initiative to support other shock brigades. The Zhoushan team and the Hangzhou team of the Zhejiang delegation launched a friendly competition. The Zhoushan team completed its task one and a half hours ahead of schedule, and then immediately took the initiative to help their competitor, the Hangzhou team, working even more joyfully than before.

Today, the construction sites were filled with the sounds of gongs and drums, and loud singing. The good news teams of the construction workers appeared on the construction sites again and again, and the enthusiasm of the young people was rising higher and higher. Singers from many delegations ran to the broadcasting station to sing the most beautiful folk songs of various ethnic groups and local operas. Chao Lu, a fifteen-year-old shepherd, sang a song "Beautiful Prairie." Last winter, in order to protect more than 500 sheep on the Inner Mongolia grassland, he followed the flock for two days and nights in a blizzard, without drinking a drop of water or eating a bite of food. His face was frostbitten and two of his fingers were frostbitten and broken. Chao Lu was visiting Beijing for the first time. He had been herding sheep all his life, and today was the first time he had used a shovel to move earth. When he stepped onto the broadcasting station, his singing was full of unparalleled excitement.

Good news was constantly coming from the broadcasting stations on each construction site. In addition to spreading the results of victories and model deeds, there were also many reports of young activists carrying out technical innovations on the construction sites to improve labor efficiency. Teng Jianhua, an expert in tool reform, and Ren Wenxue, a labor model who created a rapid steel annealing method to improve work efficiency, immediately convened a "Zhuge Liang" on-site meeting as soon as they arrived at the construction site, using local materials to immediately create earth tracks, crude iron wire sliding lines, and suspended wooden frames to deliver earth, increasing work efficiency by more than twenty times. Such things happened on every construction site, and this spirit of daring to think, dare to do, and dare to create showed the true colors of young activists. (Attached picture)

    祖国五千英雄儿女生龙活虎大显身手
    青年积极分子参加建设首都义务劳动
    新华社24日讯　出席全国青年积极分子大会的近五千名青年，今天在首都的四处工地上大显身手，他们用生龙活虎般的冲天干劲，光荣地参加了建设首都的义务劳动。
    中国共产主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记刘西元、罗毅、胡克实等和青年积极分子们在一起劳动。
    今天上午，首都的气温在零度左右，但是，这些充满着烈火般劳动热情的青年男女，都根本忘记现在已进入初冬。许多人一进入工地，便脱去了棉衣甚至鞋袜，站在泥水里干了起来。他们个个精神抖擞，混身是劲，挑土运沙，快步如飞。在一阵紧张的劳动过后，有些人满头冒着热汗，头发上结满了冰花。
    在各个工地上，青年积极分子们纷纷组成了以“黄继光”、“刘胡兰”、“赵一曼”、“丁佑君”等英雄人物命名的突击队或战斗小组，他们以突击手的姿态在这支劳动大军里出现，成为工地上最活跃的集体。在天安门前工地上，十六个民族的青年组成了一支“民族团结”突击队，他们的队长是共产党员李老大，他是二十岁的哈尼族青年。他的左臂在今年春天兴修水利工程中担任爆破手时由于发生事故被炸掉了。这个“独臂英雄”今天身上只穿着一件单衣，来回飞快地运土。来自福建海防前线的民兵英雄洪顺利、支前模范蔡玉霜、“小八路”何大年等十五个人，组成了一个民兵突击队。他们的铲子飞舞不停，车子奔跑如飞，在三个小时内就完成了九十立方土，平均每人每小时完成两立方多。在四川的青年积极分子队伍中，有一个“十一姊妹突击队”，她们都是二十岁左右的姑娘，干起活来赛似猛虎，不到两个小时，在一百五十多公尺的距离内，就运土一百多担。
    许多青年积极分子把工地当作比武台，他们互相展开了热烈的劳动竞赛。在黑龙江省的青年积极分子中，一个由十四名女青年组织的“穆桂英”排，和另一支由二十八名男青年组织的“武松”突击队，展开了四个小时的大比武，如龙似虎的中国人民解放军青年积极分子们今天同工地上的工人们展开了劳动竞赛。炮兵某部二等战斗功臣连代表徐恒准带领的运砖突击小组，平均每人每小时运砖一千二百块，超过这个工地上过去运砖纪录的三倍。工人们更不甘落后，青年工人孟繁祥、韩双林也带着突击组猛追，扁担断了，再换一支，结果很快赶上了徐恒准小组。
    在劳动竞赛中，青年积极分子们的共产主义的协作精神大放光辉，他们既有雄心超过竞赛对方，又能主动地去支援别的集体。连获十八次治淮模范称号的张友道带领的“火箭”突击队和在安徽紫芦湖工地因改革运土方法而一天提高工效二十七倍的马玉兰带领的“花木兰”突击队，展开了一场比工效的争夺战，这场竞赛的战果都不相上下，结果在两个半小时内都完成了自己的任务，他们立即主动去支援别的突击队。浙江代表团的舟山队和杭州队展开了友谊竞赛，舟山队一个半小时就提前完成了自己的任务，他们接着又立即主动去帮助竞赛对象杭州队，干得比原来更欢。
    今天，四处工地的锣鼓喧天，歌声嘹亮。工地工人们的报喜队，一次又一次地出现在工地上，青年们的干劲越鼓越高。许多代表团的歌手跑到广播台上，唱出最优美的各族民歌和各地戏曲。十五岁的牧羊员超鲁，唱了一曲“美丽的草原”。去年冬天，他在内蒙古草原上为了保护五百多只羊，在大风雪中追随羊群走了两个昼夜，没有喝一口水，没有吃一口饭，他的脸都冻破了，两个手指冻断了。超鲁是第一次到北京，过去一直放羊，今天是他第一次用铁锨铲土，当他走上广播台的时候，他的歌声充满了无比激动的热情。
    从各个工地的广播台上不断地传出捷报，其中除了传播胜利战果和模范事迹外，还有许多是报道青年积极分子们在工地上大搞技术革新、提高劳动效率的新闻。工具改革能手滕建华和创造钢材快速退火法因而提高工效的劳动模范任文学，一到工地就召集大家开“诸葛亮”现场会议，就地取材，立即创造出土轨道、粗铁丝滑运线和悬空木架送土等工具，提高工效二十多倍。这样的事情在各个工地上都有，这种敢想敢干敢于创造的精神，显示出青年积极分子的本色。（附图片）
