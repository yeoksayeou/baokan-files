Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's people of all ethnic groups, under the leadership of the Party, are determined to strive hard this winter and next spring to achieve basic water conservancy; and continue to work hard for another year to achieve comprehensive irrigation of basic farmland by 1960, achieving the goals of guaranteed irrigation without rain, no waterlogging in heavy rain, no danger from centennial floods, no major disasters from millennial floods, full utilization of water power and water surface, and guaranteed harvests in drought and flood years.

Currently, west of Hohhot and east of Sanshenggong, south of the Langshan Mountains, Wula Mountains, and Daqing Mountains, tens of thousands of people of all ethnic groups and water conservancy engineering technicians are working enthusiastically to build irrigation canals fifty to over one hundred meters wide and two to seven meters deep. This is the Yellow River Inner Mongolia Main Canal, which is scheduled to be completed before 1960, with a total length of more than six hundred li. After the completion of this project, it can irrigate more than 13.8 million mu of surrounding irrigated land, generate more than 70,000 kilowatts of electricity, and solve the residential and industrial water use of Baotou City.

The Hongshan Reservoir in Zhaowuda League, which started construction in October this year, is a key project for controlling the flood of the Xiliao River. In addition to power generation, it can tame the floods of nine rivers, including the Laoha River, Yin River, and Xibo River, freeing 2.7 million mu of farmland in the Xiliao River basin from the threat of floods and droughts.

At the same time, large, medium and small-sized reservoirs, hydropower stations, and pastoral water supply projects in the Nen River, Ergun River and other basins and pastoral areas within the autonomous region have also been successively started.

    内蒙古综合治理主要河流
    内蒙古自治区各族人民，在党的领导下，决心从今冬开始，苦战一冬一春，实现基本水利化；并继续大干一年，到1960年实现基本农田全面水利化，达到无雨保灌溉，雨大无涝灾，百年洪水不出险，千年洪水无大灾，水力水面充分利用，旱年涝载确保丰收的目标。
    目前，自呼和浩特以西，三盛公以东，顺狼山、乌拉山、大青山以南，有数万名各族民工和水利工程技术人员，正在热火朝天地修建宽五十到一百多公尺、深二到七公尺的灌溉大渠。这是准备在1960年以前竣工的黄河内蒙古总干渠，全长六百多里。这项工程完成以后，可以灌溉周围一千三百八十多万亩水浇地，可以发出七万多瓩电力，还可以解决包头市居民和工业用水。
    今年10月开工的昭乌达盟红山水库，是根治西辽河水患的关键性工程。它除了发电以外，可以驯服老哈河、阴河、锡伯河等九条河流的洪水，使西辽河流域二百七十多万亩农田免除水旱灾害的威胁。
    与此同时，自治区境内嫩江、额尔古纳河等流域及各牧区的大中小型水库、水力发电站、牧业供水工程等，也都已陆续开工。
