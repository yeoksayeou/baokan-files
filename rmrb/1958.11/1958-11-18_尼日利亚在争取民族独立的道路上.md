    Nigeria on the Road to National Independence
    Xiang Zao
      Britain's Largest Colony at Present
    At the end of October, the British authorities were forced to agree at a constitutional conference in London that Nigeria would gain complete independence on October 1, 1960. This is a significant advancement in the Nigerian people's movement for national independence.
    Nigeria is currently Britain's most extensive colony. Its land area is 877,000 square kilometers, more than three times that of the British mainland; its population is 33 million, making it the most populous country in Africa.
    Nigeria has extremely abundant natural resources. Discovered mineral deposits include tin, coal, tungsten, manganese, silver, and niobium, with niobium production ranking first in the world. Oil has also been recently discovered, with production reaching 800,000 barrels in the first half of this year. Uranium deposits have also been found. Peanut production is substantial, ranking fourth in the world in exports; cocoa exports rank third in the world; and palm oil and palm kernel exports also rank among the top in the world.
    Despite Nigeria's rich resources and production, the economy is very backward and the people live in extreme poverty due to the British colonialists' cruel exploitation and plunder.
    Nigeria has no smelting industry. Minerals are shipped abroad without processing, with 70% going to Britain and the rest mainly to the United States. Foreign trade generates a surplus every year, and the accumulated huge foreign exchange reserves are transferred to frozen accounts in British banks, which Nigeria cannot freely use. British monopoly capitalists extract huge profits from Nigeria every year. The wage income of Nigerian workers is only one-tenth of that of British workers, and the annual income of farmers is less than half the weekly wage of British workers.
            Divide and Rule
    Britain occupied Lagos, the current capital of Nigeria, in 1861, and declared Lagos and the area west of it as its colony and protectorate. By the time Nigeria gains complete independence in 1960, Britain will have carried out a full century of colonial rule here.
    "Divide and rule" is Britain's main tactic in governing Nigeria. In 1900, Britain divided Nigeria into two "protectorates," north and south. In 1914, the two protectorates were merged into the "Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria." After the Second World War, the Nigerian people's struggle against the British colonialists' cruel exploitation and colonial rule developed. In June 1945, Nigerian workers held a 45-day general strike to demand higher wages and improved living conditions, the first major demonstration of the working class's power.
    The British colonialists were extremely alarmed by the awakening of the Nigerian people. In order to ease the Nigerian people's struggle against colonial rule, the British government promulgated a "constitution" in 1947, named after the British Governor-General Richards. This constitution stipulated that Nigeria be divided into three administrative regions: North, East, and West. Each region established an advisory council, but power remained in the hands of officials appointed by the British monarch. The British colonialists constantly provoked discord among these regions and ethnic groups, hindering their unity and joint struggle for national independence.
    The Nigerian people responded to the British colonialists' divide-and-rule conspiracy with practical action. From 1949 to 1951, Nigerian workers repeatedly held powerful strike struggles. In 1949 alone, there were 36 strikes involving 47,000 participants. The colonial authorities carried out bloody repression of the workers. For example, in November 1949, police shot striking miners in Enugu, causing more than 50 casualties. This massacre sparked angry protests. Residents in several cities clashed with police. The situation was very serious. The British authorities were forced to revise the constitution and promised to increase the number of Nigerians in the legislature. This was the so-called "Macpherson Constitution." However, this constitution did not give Nigerians actual rights but strengthened the division of the country.
    In October 1953, people in various parts of Nigeria held demonstrations and strikes, demanding that Britain allow Nigeria to become autonomous in 1956. The British authorities once again formulated a constitution that came into effect on October 1, 1954, expanding the number of parliamentary representatives and expanding the powers of local legislatures, which had the right to enact laws independently. Thus, Nigeria became a federation.
    In April 1957, the premiers of the three regional governments of Nigeria held a meeting and decided to unite and fight for independence in 1959. However, this request was rejected by the British authorities at the constitutional conference held in May. The British Colonial Secretary, Lennox-Boyd, stated that the British government could not determine the date of independence.
    However, this did not thwart the Nigerian people's will to fight. Under the united struggle of the Nigerian people, Britain was finally forced to agree that October 1, 1960, would be the date of Nigeria's complete independence.
          Three Major Political Parties
    The "National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons" is the most powerful nationalist party in Nigeria. It was established in 1944. Initially, it was a federation of political, trade union, women's, and youth organizations. In 1951, the party in principle became a party with individuals as members. The leader of the party is Azikiwe, who served as the editor-in-chief of the "African Morning Post" in Accra, Ghana. After 1937, he returned to Nigeria to edit the "West African Pilot" newspaper.
    The program of the "National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons" is to fight for national independence, a democratic constitution, and national unity. The party unconditionally supported the Great Strike of June 1945, and thus gained high prestige among the masses. In 1947, the party sent a delegation to London to protest the promulgation of the "Richards Constitution" to the British government. Because the party actively fought against the British colonial authorities, it received the majority of votes in the Eastern and Western regions in the first federal election in 1954. Azikiwe served as the Premier of the Eastern government.
    The expansion of the "National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons'" influence made the British colonial authorities extremely uneasy. In 1956, the British Colonial Secretary, Lennox-Boyd, fabricated "corruption" charges and established a "special court" to investigate Azikiwe. However, Azikiwe still won the election in March 1957 and continued to serve as Premier. Azikiwe served as the head of the delegation when negotiating with Britain on the issue of independence.
    The other two major parties—the Action Group in the West and the Northern People's Congress in the North—were both established in 1951. The Premier of the Western government, Obafemi Awolowo, and the Premier of the Northern government, Alhaji Ahmadu, are the leaders of these two parties, respectively. The main program of the Action Group is to fight for autonomy in the West. The Northern People's Congress advocates for autonomy within the federal framework.
      Britain Continues to Sabotage
    Although Britain was forced to verbally agree that Nigeria would gain independence on October 1, 1960, it is still actively working in many ways to sabotage this.
    "Divide and rule" remains Britain's main tactic. At last year's London conference, Britain used the pretext of resolving the issue of minority autonomy to refuse to clearly stipulate the date of independence. Before the start of the London conference at the end of October this year, the majority of the Nigerian delegation formulated a policy of allowing Nigerians to resolve the "minority" issue on their own after independence. This removed Britain's excuse for obstructing Nigeria's early realization of complete independence.
    The Premier of the Western government, Awolowo, at the London conference at the end of October this year, tried his best to advocate for resolving the "minority" issue before achieving complete independence. After the meeting, he still hopes to win the 1959 federal election so as to establish three new states before October 1, 1960.
    Nigerian leaders have been alerted to Britain's conspiracy. They pointed out that in India and Ireland, Britain used partition to weaken independence. Currently, there are still two years before Nigeria's scheduled independence date. Therefore, it is necessary to be vigilant against Britain's divisive conspiracies at all times. (Attached picture)

    尼日利亚在争取民族独立的道路上
    湘藻
      英国目前的最大殖民地
    10月底，英国当局被迫在伦敦的宪法会议上同意尼日利亚在1960年10月1日得到完全独立。这是尼日利亚人民争取民族独立运动的一个重大进展。
    尼日利亚是目前英国幅员最广阔的殖民地。土地面积有八十七万七千平方公里，等于英国本土的三倍多；人口为三千三百万人，是人口最多的非洲国家。
    尼日利亚有极为丰富的自然资源，已发现的矿藏有锡、煤、钨、锰、银、钶，其中钶的产量占世界第一位；最近还发现了石油，今年前半年已生产石油八十万桶。铀矿也有发现。花生产量很大，出口占世界第四位；可可出口占世界第三位；棕榈油、棕榈仁的出口量也名列世界前茅。
    尼日利亚的资源和出产虽然如此丰富，但是由于英国殖民者的残酷剥削和掠夺，经济十分落后，人民生活极端贫困。
    尼日利亚国内没有冶炼工业，矿藏不经加工即运往国外，其中70％运往英国，其余部分主要运往美国。对外贸易每年出超，累积起来的巨额外汇，都被转记在英国银行的冻结账目上，尼日利亚不能随便动用。英国垄断资本家每年从尼日利亚榨取了巨额的利润。而尼日利亚工人的工资收入却只有英国工人工资的十分之一，农民一年的收入不及英国工人一周工资的一半。
            分而治之
    英国在1861年占领了尼日利亚的目前首都拉各斯，并宣布拉各斯及其以西地区为它的殖民地和保护地。到1960年尼日利亚取得完全独立的时候，英国在这里整整进行了一百年的殖民统治。
    “分而治之”是英国统治尼日利亚的主要手法。1900年，英国把尼日利亚分为南北两个“保护国”。1914年，两个保护国合并为“尼日利亚殖民地保护国”。第二次世界大战以后，尼日利亚人民反对英国殖民者的残酷剥削和殖民统治的斗争有了发展。1945年6月，尼日利亚工人为要求提高工资、改善生活，举行了长达四十五天的总罢工，这是工人阶级力量的第一次大示威。
    英国殖民者对于尼日利亚人民的觉醒感到十分恐慌，为了缓和尼日利亚人民反对殖民统治的斗争，英国政府1947年公布了一部以英国总督里查兹命名的钦定“宪法”。这部宪法规定把尼日利亚分为三个行政区：北部东部和西部。每区设立一个咨询会议，而大权则仍然操在英王任命的官员手中。英国殖民主义者不断在这几个地区之间和民族之间进行挑拨离间，阻挠他们团结一致，为争取民族独立而进行共同的斗争。
    尼日利亚人民以实际行动回击了英国殖民者的分而治之的阴谋。从1949年到1951年，尼日利亚工人多次举行了强大的罢工斗争。仅在1949年，就发生三十六次罢工，参加者四万七千人。殖民当局对工人进行了血腥的镇压。例如在1949年11月，警察枪击努恩古的罢工矿工，造成了五十多人的伤亡。这次屠杀引起了愤怒的抗议。好几个城市的居民同警察发生冲突。局势十分严重。英国当局被迫重新订定宪法，答应增加尼日利亚人在立法机构中的名额。这就是所谓“麦克弗森宪法”。但是，这部宪法并没有给尼日利亚人以实际权利，而是加强了国家的分裂。
    1953年10月间，尼日利亚各地人民举行示威游行和罢工，要求英国允许尼日利亚在1956年自治。英国当局又一次制定了一部从1954年10月1日生效的宪法，扩大议会代表名额，扩大地方议会权限，有权单独制订法律。于是尼日利亚变成了联邦。
    1957年4月，尼日利亚三个地区政府总理举行会议，决定联合一致为争取在1959年取得独立而进行斗争。但是，这个要求在5月间举行的立宪会议上又遭到了英国当局的拒绝。英国殖民大臣伦诺克斯·波伊德表示：英国政府不能确定独立日期。
    但是，这并没有能够挫败尼日利亚人民的斗争意志。在尼日利亚人民团结一致的斗争下，英国终于被迫同意1960年10月1日是尼日利亚取得完全独立的日期。
          三个主要政党
    “尼日利亚和喀麦隆民族委员会”是尼日利亚最强大的民族主义政党。它建立于1944年。开始时是一个政治、工会、妇女、青年组织的联合会。1951年，该党原则上变成了以个人作为成员的政党。党的领袖是阿齐克韦，曾在加纳的阿克拉市担任“非洲晨邮报”的总编辑。1937年后，他回到尼日利亚编辑“西非向导”报。
    “尼日利亚和喀麦隆民族委员会”的纲领是：为争取民族独立、争取民主宪法和国家统一而斗争。该党无保留地支持了1945年6月的大罢工，因而在人民群众中得到很高的威信。1947年，该党曾派出代表团去伦敦，向英国政府抗议“里查兹宪法”的颁布。由于该党积极和英国殖民当局进行斗争，在1954年的第一次联邦选举中得到了东部和西部地区的大多数选票。阿齐克韦担任了东部政府的总理。
    “尼日利亚和喀麦隆民族委员会”影响的扩大，使英国殖民当局极为不安。1956年，英国殖民大臣伦诺克斯·波伊德竟然捏造“贪污”罪名，成立“特别法庭”对阿齐克韦进行审查。但是，阿齐克韦仍在1957年3月的选举中得到胜利，并且继续担任总理职务。在和英国谈判独立问题时，阿齐克韦担任了代表团团长。
    另外两个主要政党——西部的行动派和北部的北方人民大会党，都是在1951年成立的。西部政府总理奥巴费米·阿沃卢瓦和北部政府总理哈吉·艾哈迈德分别是这两个政党的领袖。行动派的主要纲领是为争取西部自治而斗争。北方人民大会党的主张是争取在联邦范围内的自治。
      英国继续进行破坏
    英国虽然被迫在口头上同意尼日利亚在1960年10月1日取得独立，但仍然多方活动，进行破坏。
    “分而治之”仍然是英国的主要手法。去年的伦敦会议上，英国即曾借口所谓解决少数民族自治问题，拒绝明确规定独立日期。今年10月底伦敦会议开始以前，尼日利亚代表团的大多数成员即制订了“少数民族”问题由尼日利亚人在独立以后自行解决的方针。这就解除了英国阻挠尼日利亚早日实现完全独立的借口。
    西部政府总理阿沃卢瓦在今年10月底的伦敦会议上曾竭力主张在取得完全独立以前，先解决“少数民族”问题。会议以后，他仍希望在1959年联邦选举中得到胜利，以便在1960年10月1日以前建立三个新邦。
    尼日利亚的领袖们已经对英国的阴谋加以警惕。他们指出，在印度和爱尔兰，英国都曾用分治的办法来削弱独立。目前，离尼日利亚预定的独立日期还有两年。因此，必须时刻警惕英国的分裂阴谋。（附图片）
