Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, October 31st: Under the impetus of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958, the cultural work also experienced an unprecedented great leap forward. The National Cultural Work Administrative Conference held in Zhengzhou, Henan from October 10th to 27th analyzed the situation of the great leap forward in culture over the past year, and based on summarizing experience, studied the guidelines, tasks and main measures of cultural work for next year and the second five-year plan period. This conference also focused on discussing how to launch "satellites" in culture and art to greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day.

The meeting believes that in the past year, inspired by the great leap forward in production, the broad masses of workers, peasants and soldiers, on the basis of literacy, have launched a magnificent upsurge of creation. At the same time, in this year, professional artists, on the basis of the victory of the rectification and anti-rightist struggle, resolutely implemented the Party's policy of literature and art serving politics and production, went to the countryside, factories, and companies, participated in labor training, implemented the method of combining experts with the masses, and combining professional and amateur, prospering creative activities, cultivating literary and artistic teams, and a large number of new-type literary and artistic backbones continued to emerge from the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers. These mark that the situation of the great popularization of culture and art has begun to take shape, which constitutes a part of the cultural revolution that is beginning to reach a climax in our country, and powerfully cooperates with the various struggles of our people, and correspondingly promotes the development of industrial and agricultural production and the entire socialist construction. The meeting believes that during the second five-year plan period, cultural work should, in accordance with the general line of socialist construction, continue to implement the policy of serving proletarian politics and developing production, and combine it with productive labor, continue to correctly implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," vigorously realize the great popularization of culture and art combining popularization and improvement, basically build a strong working-class cultural army, and create a new national culture with a high degree of ideological and artistic socialist and communist nature, and completely change the cultural outlook of our country. According to the above guidelines and tasks, the meeting believes that in 1959, cultural and artistic work should conduct in-depth socialist and communist ideological education among the people of the whole country through various art forms and publishing, distribution, and exhibition work; closely cooperate with the greater leap forward in industry, agriculture, transportation—especially steel and agriculture—to carry out propaganda, education, and mobilization work, and improve the labor enthusiasm of the people; assist relevant departments in carrying out patriotic and internationalist education for frontline soldiers and the broad masses of militiamen; continue to complete the construction of the mass cultural network, and basically complete the establishment of the cultural network of counties and communes (of which the film projection network will be completed by 1960); continue to transform and improve the thinking of existing artists, vigorously cultivate new cultural and artistic forces among workers, peasants and soldiers, and strengthen and improve the cultural and artistic teams. What is particularly important is to launch "satellites" in culture and art in terms of creation, performance, and theoretical research to greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day.

The meeting also pointed out that in the current great leap forward in cultural work, there are still phenomena of uneven development between regions and departments, and the quality of various tasks is generally not high. The political and ideological level and professional level of the cultural and artistic team cannot yet adapt to the objective requirements, especially the objective requirements of educating the masses with communist ideas and the great popularization of culture. The leadership of the cultural and artistic departments is also lagging behind the development of the situation. According to these situations and the development of the objective situation, the meeting believes that in the next few years, the leadership of the cultural work departments must vigorously improve the leadership methods, pay attention to grasping ideas, grasping creation, grasping teams, and grasping equipment. Special attention should be paid to grasping ideas. This winter and next spring, the cultural work teams in various places should, in accordance with the principle that educators must first be educated themselves, combine the socialist and communist education movement carried out in rural areas to conduct a universal socialist and communist education, which is an extremely important measure.

The meeting was summarized by Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture. Wu Zhipu, First Secretary of the Henan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave a report on the comprehensive great leap forward in Henan Province at the meeting.

The meeting was attended by heads of cultural bureaus, film bureaus, and publishing bureaus of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and heads of literary and art groups such as the Chinese Artists Association, the Chinese Dramatists Association, and the Chinese Musicians Association.

    创造共产主义的民族新文化
    全国文化工作行政会议提出宏伟奋斗目标
    据新华社郑州31日电　1958年的文化工作，在工农业生产大跃进的带动下，也出现了史无前例的大跃进局面。10月10日至27日在河南郑州举行的全国文化工作行政会议，分析了这一年来文化大跃进的形势，并在总结经验的基础上，研究了明年以及第二个五年计划期间文化工作的方针、任务和主要措施。这次会议还着重讨论了如何在文化艺术方面大放“卫星”迎接国庆十周年的问题。
    会议认为，一年来，广大工农兵群众在生产大跃进的鼓舞下，在扫盲的基础上，掀起了波澜壮阔的创作热潮。同时，这一年中，专业文艺工作者在整风、反右斗争胜利的基础上，坚决执行党的文艺为政治、为生产服务的方针，下乡、下厂、下连队，参加劳动锻炼，实行专家与群众结合，专业与业余结合的方法，繁荣了创作活动，培养了文艺队伍，大批新型的文艺工作骨干不断从工农兵群众中涌现出来。这些，标志文化艺术大普及的形势已开始形成，它构成了我国开始进入高潮的文化革命的一部分，并有力地配合了我国人民的各项斗争，也相应地促进了工农业生产和整个社会主义建设的发展。会议认为：在第二个五年计划期间，文化工作应根据社会主义建设总路线，继续贯彻为无产阶级政治、为发展生产服务的方针，并与生产劳动相结合，继续正确执行“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策，大力实现普及与提高相结合的文化艺术大普及，基本上建成一支强大的工人阶级文化大军，创造出具有高度思想性、艺术性的社会主义、共产主义的民族的新文化，彻底改变我国的文化面貌。根据上述方针、任务，会议认为1959年文化艺术工作应通过各种艺术形式和出版、发行展览等工作，在全国人民中，深入地进行社会主义、共产主义思想教育；密切配合工农业、交通运输——特别是钢铁、农业的更大跃进，进行宣传、教育和鼓动工作，提高人民群众的劳动热忱；协助有关部门对前线战士和广大民兵进行爱国主义和国际主义教育；继续完成群众文化网的建设，基本上完成县和公社的文化网的设置（其中电影放映网到1960年完成）；继续改造、提高现有文艺工作者的思想，大力培养工农兵群众中文化艺术新生力量，壮大和提高文化艺术队伍。特别重要的是，大放文化艺术在创作、表演、理论研究等方面的“卫星”，迎接国庆十周年。
    这次会议还指出，当前文化工作大跃进中，仍然存在着地区与地区、部门与部门之间发展不平衡的现象，各项工作的质量一般说还不高。文化艺术队伍的政治思想水平和业务水平还不能适应客观的要求，特别是还不能适应以共产主义思想教育群众，以及文化大普及的客观要求。文化艺术部门的领导也还落在形势发展的后面。根据这些情况和客观形势的发展，会议认为：今后几年中文化工作部门的领导上必须大力改进领导方法，注意抓思想，抓创作，抓队伍，抓设备。特别要注意抓思想。今冬明春，各地文化工作队伍应该根据教育者必先自己受教育的原则，结合农村中进行的社会主义共产主义教育运动，普遍地进行一次社会主义共产主义教育，这是一项极其重要的措施。
    会议由文化部副部长钱俊瑞作总结报告。中共河南省委第一书记吴芝圃在会上作了关于河南省全面大跃进的报告。
    参加这次会议的有各省、市、自治区文化局、电影局、出版局等单位负责人，中国美术家协会、中国戏剧家协会、中国音乐家协会等文艺团体负责人。
