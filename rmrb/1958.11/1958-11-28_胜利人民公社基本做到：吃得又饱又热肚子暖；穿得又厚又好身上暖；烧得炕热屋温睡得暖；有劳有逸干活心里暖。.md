    Victory People's Commune has Basically Achieved:
    Eating Full and Hot with a Warm Stomach; Wearing Thick and Good Clothes for a Warm Body; Burning the Kang Hot for a Warm Sleep; Working with Labor and Leisure for a Warm Heart.
    According to a report in the Jilin Daily, the Party Committee of the Victory People's Commune in Lishu County adopted a working method of grasping production with one hand and grasping life with the other. After less than half a month, it basically achieved making all commune members eat their fill, dress warmly, and have warm kangs and houses, which further boosted the labor enthusiasm of the commune members.
    Half a month ago, the commune did some work in running public canteens and also allocated some funds to the commune members to buy winter clothes; however, because the First Secretary of the Party Committee was busy day and night leading the commune members to make rush deep plowing and deliver grain for state purchase, without specifically grasping life, there were still many problems that needed to be solved urgently. For example: the canteens in the fourteen management areas of the commune were not run well; although most of the able-bodied commune members wore cotton clothes, a considerable number of elderly people and children did not wear cotton clothes; especially the commune members were busy day and night with production, without time to collect firewood, and some commune members worked all day and slept on cold kangs at night, and could not get adequate rest. At the beginning of November, the Party Committee of the commune promptly convened a meeting of the Party General Branch Secretaries of each management area, discussed this issue in detail, and finally decided that a Party Committee Secretary and a Deputy Director should be specifically responsible for leading this work, and each management area should also be led by a Secretary and a Director, and determined to run the canteens well within five days. At the same time, 130,000 yuan was drawn from the commune's grain sales proceeds to buy cloth for the commune members to add winter clothes, so that the commune members could wear warmly. In order to ensure that the commune members lived on hot kangs, from mid-November, three bundles of sorghum stalks were temporarily allocated to each kang every day, and the masses were further mobilized to solve the problem.
    By November 16, most of the 293 public canteens in the entire commune had changed their appearance. In the Luming Management Area's public canteen, there was originally very little food and few dishes. Now, not only were there pickles and soy sauce dishes every day, but also one stir-fried dish and one soup were made for both lunch and dinner. Most canteens also had cooked dishes in the morning. The Shunchangbao Management Area, which runs the best canteen, ensured that the food did not repeat for seven days. Small stoves were also set up for the elderly and children's canteens for children; in order to ensure the convenience of commune members' guests, the canteen stipulated that whenever commune members had guests, whatever dishes were needed would be made. The elderly and patients were also taken care of separately.
    After the commune allocated funds for making winter clothes, each management area organized all the sewing machines to rush to make winter clothes overnight. At present, most of the commune members have basically put on cotton clothes.
    The sorghum stalks that have been distributed are burned so that the kangs are hot and the houses are warm. Most of the households with opposite kangs feel that not only is it enough to burn now, but it will be enough even if it gets colder. The Party Committee of the commune estimates that the few households with only one kang may be colder in the severe winter season, and are considering appropriately increasing firewood or mobilizing the commune members to further find ways to solve the problem to ensure that they live in warm houses.
    Due to the good arrangements of the Party Committee of the commune, the commune members in the entire commune have basically achieved: eating full and hot with a warm stomach, wearing thick and good clothes for a warm body, burning the kang hot for a warm sleep. In addition, each management area has rationally arranged labor and rest time, and Wang Jiwu, a commune member of the Quanyanling Management Area, added another warmth, saying: "Now that we eat our fill, wear warmly, and sleep on heated kangs, we are really energetic in working, and our hearts are always warm. How can we be worthy of Chairman Mao if we don't work hard!" Zhang Fengyan, a commune member of the Dongjiawobao Management Area, said: "Now, even if we are more tired, we are satisfied." Therefore, a new upsurge of labor and leisure and soaring enthusiasm has emerged in the entire commune.

    胜利人民公社基本做到：
    吃得又饱又热肚子暖；穿得又厚又好身上暖；烧得炕热屋温睡得暖；有劳有逸干活心里暖。
    据吉林日报消息　梨树县胜利人民公社党委，采取了一手抓生产，一手抓生活的工作方法，经过不到半个月的时间，就基本上做到了使所有的社员吃得饱、穿得暖、炕热屋暖，进一步鼓舞了社员的劳动积极性。
    半月以前，公社在办公共食堂上做了些工作，也曾拨出一部分款给社员添置了冬衣；但是由于党委第一书记昼夜忙于领导社员突击深翻和送征购粮工作，没有具体抓生活，所以还存在不少急待解决的问题。例如：社的十四个管理区的食堂都办得不好；虽然大部分能劳动的社员穿上了棉衣，有相当一些老年人、儿童没有穿上棉衣；特别是社员日夜忙于生产，没有时间打柴禾，有的社员白天干一天活，晚上睡凉炕，不能适当休息。公社党委于11月初，及时召开了各管理区党总支书记会议，详尽地讨论了这个问题，最后确定由一名党委书记、一名副主任专门负责领导这项工作，各管理区也由一名书记、一名主任领导这一工作，并确定五天内就搞好食堂。同时从公社卖粮款中，抽出十三万元钱给社员买布添置了冬衣，让社员穿的暖和。为了保证社员住上热炕，从11月中旬起，每铺炕每天暂时拨给三捆秫秸，并进一步发动群众进行解决。
    到11月16日，全公社二百九十三个公共食堂，绝大多数变了样。路明管理区的公共食堂，原先吃饭很少有菜，现在不仅每天都有了咸菜、酱碟，午、晚两顿饭还做到了有一个炒菜一个汤，多数食堂早晨也有熟菜。食堂办得最好的顺城堡管理区，做到吃饭七天不重样。还给老年人设上了小灶，小孩设上儿童食堂；为了保证社员来客的方便，食堂规定社员家什么时候来客，需要什么菜就给做什么菜。对老年人、病人也都分别加以照顾。
    社里拨出做冬衣的款项之后，各管理区把所有的缝纫机组织起来，连夜突击赶制冬衣，到目前大部社员基本上都穿上了棉衣。
    已经发下去的秫秸，烧得炕热屋子暖，占多数的对面炕的户，都感到不仅现在够烧，再冷些也够用的。对少数一铺炕的户，社党委估计可能到严寒季节要冷一些，正考虑将适当地增加柴禾，或发动社员进一步想办法解决，以保证他们住上温暖的屋子。
    由于社党委安排的好，现在全公社社员基本上达到了：吃得又饱又热肚子暖，穿得又厚又好身上暖，烧得炕热屋温睡得暖。再加上各管理区都合理地安排了劳动和休息时间，泉眼岭管理区的社员王吉武又给加上了一暖，他说：“现在咱们吃的饱，穿的暖，睡加热炕头，干活真有劲，心里总是热乎乎的，再不好好干，怎么能对起毛主席！”董家窝堡管理区社员张凤彦说：“现在就是再累些，也心满意足了。”因此，在全公社出现了一个有劳有逸干劲冲天的新高潮。
