Manufacturing Large Equipment Requires Walking on Two Legs

The fully-fledged, steel-centered industrial construction requires the machinery industry sector to rapidly provide a large number of complex large-scale equipment. Next year, the supply task of large equipment will increase exponentially, even tenfold or more. How to manufacture large equipment in a more, faster, better and more economical way has become one of the most important tasks at present.

The task is so arduous and urgent, how to solve it? Like other industries, manufacturing large equipment must also implement the mass line and learn to walk on two legs. One is "large, foreign, mass", and the other is "small, indigenous, mass".

Generally speaking, manufacturing large machines requires large casting and forging equipment to produce large blanks; large machine tools to cut large parts; large cranes to lift heavy objects; and tall workshops to engage in the production activities of the above-mentioned large parts. Obviously, large factories with such conditions are manufacturing large equipment that is commensurate with them, which is no problem. So, can small factories that do not have such conditions manufacture large equipment? Regarding this question, during this period, many factories in various places have provided preliminary answers to varying degrees and in different aspects through their own practices. The Harbin Jiulian Machinery Factory is an outstanding example and a bright red banner for manufacturing large equipment using small, indigenous, and mass methods.

The Harbin Jiulian Machinery Factory is a small factory with no large workshops, no large machine tools and cranes, no steel casting equipment, and no engineers. But it is also a large factory that has manufactured various large equipment such as ball mills with a diameter of four meters, washing machines with a height of four meters two, and cement dryers weighing fifty tons. They "take the sky as the roof and the ground as the bed", all self-made machine tools are processed in the open space, and all the large equipment manufactured is assembled in the open space. They "use light to control weight", using several chain pulleys instead of large cranes. And the most outstanding method is to cleverly use discarded old machine tools and old gear transmission boxes from cars and tanks, as well as several angle steels and I-beams, to piece together various mobile machine tools, like children's building blocks, to be assembled and used at any time, and disassembled after use. They mobilize dead machines to become ever-changing, so that people truly become the masters of machines, rather than being controlled by machines.

People may think: using this piecemeal method for production is only a temporary expedient, and the efficiency is not as high as large, foreign, "regular" machine tools. Of course, when the production task is fixed, large, foreign, "regular" machine tools are efficient. However, when the production task is not fixed, this judgment is incorrect. In this case, because mobile machine tools have greater adaptability, their utilization rate is higher than that of foreign machine tools; and unlike foreign machine tools, they sometimes have to "use a sledgehammer to crack a nut", but instead can make the most of small materials and achieve the effect of "using a chicken knife to kill a cow." The production practice of the Jiulian Factory strongly proves this point. Using this method, the country has not invested a penny in the past three years, but the output value has increased twentyfold.

People may ask: What does a "four-nothing" small factory rely on to be so powerful and have so many wonderful ideas? Their answer is two words: "Fearlessness!" They are not like some people who are intimidated and at a loss when they see a big job. They say, "Don't be afraid of big jobs, just be afraid of fear." They are not like some people who sigh and frown when they hear about big tasks, and try to refuse. Their attitude is: "Take on the task first, then think of a solution." Under the leadership of the Party, with politics in command, they have broken superstitions and strived for self-reliance in everything. This is the source of their wisdom and strength.

The Jiulian Machinery Factory is a small factory in a district of Harbin. There are many machinery factories of this scale in large and small cities across the country, and even many county-level machinery factories are no less in scale than this. It seems that wherever there is a need to manufacture large equipment locally or nearby, the experience of this factory should be promoted, and the method of "small, indigenous, and mass" should be learned to manufacture large equipment. It is necessary to launch a truly widespread mass movement to manufacture large equipment.

How small factories rely on the masses to manufacture large equipment, that is, how to learn to walk on the "small, indigenous, and mass" leg in manufacturing large equipment, this question has been answered by the experience created by many small factories in many regions, especially the Harbin Jiulian Machinery Factory. Then, has the question of how large factories with modern large equipment rely on the masses to build large equipment been answered as well? That is, has walking on the "large, foreign, and mass" leg been fully learned? Judging from the current situation, I am afraid that we cannot fully say this. It is true that our existing large equipment manufacturing plants are the backbone and the main force in providing the country with large and important equipment. The comrades in these plants are working hard and making leaps and bounds in production, and many plants have achieved remarkable results in relying on the masses. However, there are also many such large plants, precisely because they have these modern large equipment as backing, they have not fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses and fully utilized the wisdom of the masses. Therefore, there are not many methods in these plants, and "indigenous" methods appear and are used even less. Some people even look down on "indigenous" methods and blindly believe in "regularity." Therefore, the potential in these plants has not been fully tapped.

Then, how can large equipment manufacturing plants with modern equipment turn industrial production into a mass movement, and how can they learn to walk on the "large, foreign, and mass" leg? The answer is that, like all industrial and mining enterprises, it is necessary to thoroughly follow the mass line by using the four major tools (speaking out freely, airing views fully, writing big-character posters, and holding great debates) and the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" method. Judging from the experience of some factories, modern mechanical factories must grasp two points to implement this policy. One is to hand over the tasks and the products to be made to the masses without reservation, from management to manufacturing, from design to technology. The Changchun Automobile Factory seized this point, and the output of cars per shift increased from 100 to 250; and by concentrating the advantages of various cars, they designed and trial-produced a new type of car with a light body and heavy load; and in one month, they designed and trial-produced a new type of luxury car. The other is to hand over the manufacturing and reform of production tools to the masses, so that the masses dare to reform foreign machine tools and dare to manufacture "indigenous machine tools" according to the requirements of production, and compete with foreign machine tools. In this way, indigenous elements can emerge from foreign elements, foreign elements can emerge from indigenous elements, and the combination of indigenous and foreign elements can create unique machine tools. The Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory created assembled vertical lathes, large lathes, and various large indigenous boring machines when the processing capacity and skills of large foreign machine tools were insufficient, which is a good example of daring to despise foreign machine tools and self-manufacture indigenous machine tools. They are also continuing to manufacture various assembled machine tools to arm themselves and are exploring and creating new directions for large machine tools. It seems that for modern large equipment manufacturing plants, handing over the products to the masses for analysis and handing over the power to reform production tools to the masses is an important aspect of following the mass line.

The experiences created by the Harbin Jiulian Machinery Factory, the Changchun Automobile Factory, the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory, and other factories in many provinces and cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, and Chengdu, can be summarized as: using small to control large, and using the method of ants gnawing at bones to solve the problem of metal cutting; using the method of "using light to control weight" and "using multiple to control weight" to lift heavy objects, in order to alleviate the tension of insufficient crane supply and avoid the waste of crane load capacity; reducing the large into small, and piecing together small into large, in order to solve and alleviate the insufficient capacity of large casting and forging equipment; using iron instead of steel, using casting instead of forging, and using non-metallic materials to replace metallic materials, in order to solve the shortage of materials and casting and forging equipment and to rationally utilize existing materials and casting and forging equipment.

If we adopt these methods under the premise of putting politics in command, breaking superstitions, implementing the four major tools and the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" policy, and thoroughly following the mass line, it is entirely possible to change the situation where the manufacturing of large equipment cannot keep up with demand.

If we further promote these experiences to capital construction, and try to use converters or simple open-hearth furnaces instead of large open-hearth furnaces and large electric furnaces, then the expansion and new construction projects of large equipment manufacturing plants will also be reduced from large to small, from high to low, and from heavy to light, thereby greatly reducing construction investment, shortening construction time, and accelerating the development of the entire large equipment manufacturing industry.

Learning to walk on two legs in manufacturing large equipment has now produced some examples and found some clues. We must vigorously promote these experiences and continue to enrich these experiences. All large and small mechanical factories and repair shops across the country, as long as there is a need to manufacture large equipment locally, should participate in this movement. In this way, we can confidently and victoriously complete the task of large equipment needed for the steel-centered industrial construction.

Let us boldly and vigorously open up a new era in manufacturing large equipment.

    制造大型设备必须学会两条腿走路
    正在全面跃进的以钢为纲的工业建设，需要机械工业部门迅速提供大量的结构复杂的大型设备。明年大设备的供应任务更将成倍地以至十几倍地增长。如何多快好省地制造大型设备，已成为当前最重要的任务之一。
    任务如此艰巨急迫，怎样解决呢？和其他工业一样，制造大型设备，也必须贯彻群众路线，学会用两条腿走路。一条是“大、洋、群”，另一条是“小、土、群”。
    通常说来，制造大型机器，要有大的铸锻设备，以生产大型毛胚；要有大型机床，以切削大件；要有大的吊车，以起吊重活；要有高大的厂房，以便从事上述大件的生产活动。显然，具有这样条件的大厂，制造与之相适应的大型设备，是名实相符，没有问题的。那末，不具备这样条件的小厂，能否制造大型设备呢？对于这个问题，这一时期各地有不少的工厂都用自己的实践不同程度地、在不同的方面作了初步解答。而哈尔滨机联机械厂则是用小、土、群的方法，制造大型设备的一个突出的典型，一面鲜明的红旗。
    哈尔滨机联机械厂是一个一无大厂房，二无大机床大吊车，三无铸钢设备，四无工程师的小厂。但它又是一个制造过直径四公尺的球磨机，高达四公尺二的洗涤机，重达五十吨的水泥烘干机等好多种大型设备的大厂。他们“把天当作房盖，把地当作床身”，所有自制的机床都是在空地上加工，所制造的大设备都在空地上装配。他们“以轻制重”，用几个链条滑车代替了大型吊车。而最出色的办法是巧妙地利用废弃的旧机床和汽车、坦克上的旧齿轮传动箱，以及几根角钢、工字钢，拼凑成各种活动机床，像儿童玩的积木一样，随装随用，随用随拆。他们把死机器调动得千变万化，使人真正做了机器的主宰，而不是让机器制住了活的人。
    人们可能会想：用这种拼凑的办法从事生产，不过是一时的权宜之计，效率总不如大的、洋的、“正规的”机床高。当然，在生产任务固定不变的情况下，大的、洋的、“正规的”机床，效率是高的。但是，在生产任务不固定的情况下，这种判断就不对了。在这种情况下，因为活动机床的适应性大，利用率反而比洋机床高；而且不会像洋机床那样，有时不得不“杀鸡用牛刀”，反而可以小材大用，收“杀牛用鸡刀”之效。机联厂的生产实践有力地证实了这一点。他们用这个办法，三年来国家没有投资一文钱，产值却增长了二十倍。
    人们可能会问：一个“四无”小厂，凭借什么能够这样神通广大，妙计多端呢？他们的答复是两个字：“不怕！”他们不像有些人那样，一见活大就望而生畏，一筹莫展。他们说：“不怕活大，就怕害怕。”他们不像有些人那样，一听见任务大，就唉声叹气，愁眉苦脸，设法拒绝。他们的态度是：“先拿下任务，再想办法。”他们在党的领导下，政治挂了帅，破除了迷信，样样事情都力求自力更生。这就是他们的智慧和力量的源泉。
    机联机械厂是哈尔滨市一个区属的小厂。像这样规模的机械厂，全国各地大小城市大有所在，甚至不少县属的机械厂，其规模亦不亚于此。看来，凡是有就地或就近制造大型设备需要的地方，都应当推广这个厂的经验，学会用“小土群”的方法制造大型设备，都有必要开展一个真正广泛的制造大型设备的群众运动。
    小厂如何依靠群众制造大型设备，也就是说，在制造大型设备方面如何学会用“小土群”这条腿走路，这个问题已经为很多地区的不少小厂，特别是哈尔滨机联机械厂所创造的经验解答了。那么，拥有现代大设备的大厂，如何依靠群众来大造大型设备的问题，是否也都得到了解答呢？也就是说，用“大洋群”这条腿走路，是否都已经学会了呢？就目前情况看来，恐怕还不能完全这样说。不错，我们现有的大型设备制造厂是骨干，是为国家提供大型设备和重要设备的主力军，这些厂的同志们努力奋发，生产也是一跃再跃，并且已经有不少的厂在依靠群众方面取得了显著的成绩。但是，另外有许多这样的大厂，正因为有这些现代的大设备作靠山，就还没有充分调动群众的积极性，充分发挥群众的智慧，因而在这些厂里，办法也就不多，“土”办法出现和使用得就更少。甚至有人还看不起“土”办法，一味迷信“正规”。因而在这些厂里，潜力就发掘得很不充分。
    那么，拥有现代设备的大型设备制造厂，究竟怎样才能把办工业搞成群众运动，怎样才能学会用“大洋群”的腿走路呢？回答是，像所有的工矿企业一样，必须用四大（大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论）和两参一改三结合的办法，彻底走群众路线。从一些工厂的经验看来，现代化的机械工厂贯彻这一方针，必须抓住两条。一条是把任务和要做的产品放手交给群众，从管理到制造，从设计到工艺，都毫无保留地交给群众。长春汽车厂抓住了这一条，就由班产汽车一百台提高到了二百五十台；并且集中各种汽车的长处，设计和试制出了一种车身轻、载货量重的新型汽车；用一个月的时间，设计和试制出了一种新型的高级轿车。另一条是把生产工具的制造和改革放手交给群众，使群众根据生产的要求敢于改革洋机床，敢于制造“土机床”，与洋机床比武较量。这样，洋中出土，土中出洋，土洋结合，就能创造出独具风格的机床来。沈阳重型机械厂在大洋机床加工能力不足和本领不行的情况下，创造出了装配式的大立车、大车床以及各种大土镗床，就是敢于蔑视洋机床、自制土机床的一个很好的范例。他们还继续在制造各种装配式的机床来武装自己，在探寻和创造着大机床的新方向。看来，现代化的大型设备制造厂，把产品交给群众去解剖，把改革生产工具的权力交给群众去掌握，是走群众路线的重要关节。
    哈尔滨机联机械厂、长春汽车厂、沈阳重型机械厂，以及上海、天津、武汉、成都等许多省市的其他工厂所创造的经验，归纳起来，就是：以小制大、用蚂蚁啃骨头的方法来解决金属切削的问题；用“以轻制重”、“以多制重”的办法起吊重活，以缓和吊车供应不足的紧张局面和避免吊车荷重能力的浪费；化大为小，拼小成大，以解决和缓和大型铸锻设备能力之不足；以铁代钢，以铸代锻，用非金属材料代替金属材料，以解决材料和铸锻设备的不足和合理利用现有的材料和铸锻设备。
    如果我们在政治挂帅，破除迷信，贯彻四大和两参一改、三结合的方针，彻底走群众路线的前提下，采用这些办法，大型设备的制造赶不上需要的情况就完全有可能改变。
    如果我们进一步把这些经验推广到基本建设中去，而且尽量采用转炉或者简易平炉来代替大平炉和大电炉，那么，大型设备制造厂的扩建和新建项目也将会化大为小、化高为低，化重为轻，从而大大降低建设投资，缩短建设时间，加快整个大型设备制造工业的发展。
    制造大型设备学会用两条腿走路，现在已经有了一些榜样，摸到了一些门路。我们要大力推广这些经验，继续充实这些经验。全国各地大大小小的机械工厂和修理车间，只要有就地制造大型设备的需要，就都应当参加到这个运动中来。这样，我们就可以满怀信心地胜利完成以钢为纲的工业建设所需要的大型设备的任务。
    放开胆量，抖擞精神，让我们来开辟制造大型设备的新纪元。
