Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Telegram, October 29th: Eighty-one train cars from Changsha Railway Station, loaded with approximately three thousand tons of rice, are being shipped to industrial cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Anshan. As of this point, Hunan Province has transferred out 248.8 million jin of rice in October, exceeding this month's transfer quota by 3 million jin. The amount of rice transferred out this month is 51% higher than the same period last year. Currently, piles of grain at many port docks are continuously being transported to industrial cities.

This year, Hunan Province has seen an unprecedented bumper harvest of grain crops, with total grain output more than doubling compared to last year. The amount of rice transferred out this year will increase by approximately 300 million jin compared to last year. The current situation is: there is plenty of grain at the grassroots level, but due to a shortage of rural labor and transportation tools, the grain transfer plans for the past three months have not been completed well. After the provincial grain bureau chiefs' meeting in mid-October, Party committees in various regions paid attention to this work. In overcoming the current difficulties of insufficient labor and transportation tools, the successful experiences they have explored are: First, various regions have fully utilized the superiority of the people's communes, seized production gaps, and, led by the Party committee secretaries, adopted a "battle group" approach to carry out a blitz for centralized transportation. Dong'an County conducted four grain transportation blitzes, and in October, the county completed 110% of its grain transfer task. Second, various regions have improved grain purchasing work in accordance with local conditions, combining purchasing with grain transportation. In the Dongting Lake area, the main grain-producing area of the province, farmers have promoted the method of "inspection and quality checks on the boat, warehousing on the boat, and transfer on the boat," achieving collection, transportation, and concentration at the same time, avoiding loading, unloading, and transferring of ships midway, and accelerating the centralized transportation of grain. Third, mutual cooperation and coordination between departments and counties, adopting methods such as connecting vehicles and ships, direct transportation, and cross-border grain delivery, shortening transportation distances, and fully utilizing the effectiveness of transportation tools, have played a significant role in ensuring grain transfer work. Youxian County, one of the province's iron smelting bases, fully utilized the empty return trips of trucks transporting iron to transport grain, saving 7,196 yuan in transportation costs. In addition, by adopting methods such as cross-county grain delivery and shortening transportation distances, they saved nearly 70,000 labor days. In October, this county exceeded its transfer quota by more than 860,000 jin.

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The national grain purchase campaign, characterized by large movements driving small movements, ants moving mountains, and short-term blitzes, has been rapidly launched. On the current busy steel and autumn harvest transportation lines, everywhere is filled with vehicles and ships transporting grain, rushing to transport grain into warehouses. According to reports from the national grain telephone conference held by the Ministry of Grain on October 25th and 26th: Henan, Hebei, Anhui, Hunan, and Shandong provinces have already seen over sixty "Red Flag Counties" that have completed or exceeded their grain purchase tasks. The phenomenon of slow progress in grain purchase work across the country has been somewhat changed, and the speed of warehousing in many regions has doubled or even several times faster than in the same period in previous years.

The emergency instructions of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council on blitzing the completion of agricultural product purchase and transfer tasks are a driving force in reversing the slow progress of grain purchase work. After the instructions were issued, all provinces and regions convened meetings to review and deploy grain purchase work. Most provinces also sent inspection teams and work teams to go deep into the communes to inspect the purchase work and help with the warehousing blitz.

In the high tide of the warehousing purchase blitz, tens of millions of return vehicles and ships transporting steel, millions of handcarts and bicycles in Henan, Hebei, and other provinces, sheepskin rafts on the Yellow River, bamboo and wood rafts in the South, and all available tools were utilized and unified arranged by the communes to transport grain. Hubei, Shandong, Henan, and other provinces, without affecting steel and three-autumn production, widely mobilized idle urban labor and rural labor to form millions of various professional purchase and warehousing armies. They adopted a large-scale collaboration, assembly-line operation method, which did not delay production and greatly accelerated the warehousing progress.

The people's commune members in various regions widely participated in the purchase and warehousing work. Many communes have generally established grain quality inspection, drying, weighing, evaluation, and accounting groups. The grain is mostly inspected, evaluated, accounted for, and transferred on-site at the commune, and the warehousing speed is very fast.

### 抓住生产间隙　突击调运粮食  湖南超额完成外调任务  河南河北等五省出现六十多个完成粮食征购任务的“红旗县”

    抓住生产间隙　突击调运粮食
    湖南超额完成外调任务
    河南河北等五省出现六十多个完成粮食征购任务的“红旗县”
    据新华社长沙电　10月29日，长沙火车站八十一个车皮，满载着约三千吨大米运往北京、上海、天津、鞍山等工业城市。至此，湖南省10月份已外调大米二亿四千八百万斤，超额完成这个月外调任务三百万斤。这个月全省完成外调大米数量较去年同期多51％。现在，许多港口码头上成堆的粮食，仍源源不断地运向工业城市。
    今年湖南省粮食作物空前丰收，粮食总产量比去年翻一番以上。今年外调大米约较去年增加三亿斤。当前的状况是：下面粮食多，但由于农村劳力紧张，运输工具不足，在过去三个月，粮食外调计划都完成得不够好。10月中旬，全省粮食局长会议后，各地党委都注意了这一工作。他们在突破当前劳力、运输工具不足的困难中，摸索出的成功经验是：首先，各地充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，抓住生产间隙，由党委书记挂帅，采取兵团作战的方式，进行突击集运。东安县进行了四次突击运粮，10月份全县完成外调粮食任务110％。其次，各地因地制宜地改进了粮食收购工作，使收购与粮运结合起来。在全省粮食主要产区的洞庭湖滨农民都推行“就船入库，就社验质，就船调运”的办法，做到随收随运到集中地点，避免了船只中途装卸、转运，加速了粮食的集运。第三，各部门、各县间互相协作配合，采取车船衔接，直线运输和跨界交粮等办法，缩短运距，充分发挥运输工具效能，对保证粮食调运工作，起了很大作用。全省炼铁基地之一的攸县，充分利用运铁汽车回空时运粮，节约运费七千一百九十六元，加上采取跨县交粮，缩短运距等办法，共节约近七万个劳动日。这个县10月份超额完成外调任务八十六万多斤。
    据新华社讯　以大运动套小运动、蚂蚁搬泰山、短期突击完成为特点的全国粮食征购运动已经迅速展开。在当前繁忙的钢铁、秋收运输线上，到处都夹有送粮的车船，突击赶运粮食入库。据粮食部10月25、26两日召开的全国粮食电话会议汇报：河南、河北、安徽、湖南和山东五省已经出现了六十多个完成或超额完成粮食征购任务的“红旗县”。全国各地征购工作进展迟缓的现象已有所改变，许多地区入库速度比往年同期加快了一倍到数倍。
    中共中央、国务院关于突击完成农产品收购调运任务的紧急指示，是扭转粮食征购工作进展迟缓的一个动力。指示下达后，各省、区都召集会议对粮食征购工作作了检查和布置。大部分省还派出检查组、工作队，深入公社检查征购工作，帮助突击入库。
    在突击征购入库高潮中，几千万运送钢铁的回空车船，河南、河北等省数以百万计的手推车、自行车，黄河的羊皮筏，南方的竹木排，一切可以利用的工具，都由公社统一安排利用起来运粮。湖北、山东、河南等省在不影响钢铁和三秋生产的前提下，广泛发动城市闲散劳动力和农村劳动力，组成上百万的各种征购入库专业大军。他们采用大协作、流水作业的操作办法，不误生产，还大大加快了入库进度。
    各地人民公社社员广泛参加了征购入库工作。许多地区的公社里普遍建立了粮食验质、翻晒、过磅、评价、记账小组。粮食大都是就社验质、就社评价、就社过账、就社转运，入库速度很快。
