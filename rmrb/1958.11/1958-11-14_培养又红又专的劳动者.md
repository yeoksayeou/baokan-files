Cultivating Laborers Who Are Both Red and Expert
Zhang Ke

Since the Changzhi Special District launched the "Skillful Girl" movement, more than 170,000 "skillful girls," "skillful daughters-in-law," and "female local experts" have emerged. This has suddenly added a large number of versatile or specialized "experts" to the countryside. With these people, barren land can be turned into fertile fields, and unnoticed dried apricots and plums can be made into delicious green plums, apricot jam, and apricot cakes. Rural areas that have never had cars now have self-made indigenous automobiles. More importantly, with these people, the technological innovation movement in industrial and agricultural production will be carried out more widely and deeply.

In the past, there were indeed many things that women could not do. But that was not due to women's innate clumsiness, but rather because the old society set up many obstacles, preventing them from having the same learning opportunities as men, and thus generally lagging behind men in culture and technology. Since liberation, the old rules that bound women have been gradually swept away; since the Great Leap Forward, the communist style of women daring to think and act has been universally established; especially after the collectivization of life, women have freed themselves from heavy housework and have gone out of their homes to participate in various activities and labor production just like men. Precisely because women have been subjected to long-term constraints, once they are completely liberated, they will burst out with soaring energy and unparalleled political enthusiasm, daring to fight against all difficulties and daring to try new things they have never done before. The leaders of Changzhi Special District understood this point. After discovering the typical examples of Song Chou’er, Wang Leping, and Li Chunhua, three "skillful girls" in Gaoping County, they immediately launched the "Skillful Girl" movement throughout the special district.

Of course, carrying out the "Skillful Girl" movement will encounter obstacles from various views left over from the old society that look down on women, such as saying: "If men can't do it well, how can women do it well," "No matter how skillful you are, learning a skill will always take three or four years." In particular, some people believe that carrying out the "Skillful Girl" movement will turn "skillful" into "clumsy," which means that carrying out this movement will divert strength and affect the basic work. Not only do people with conservative ideas have this question, but also some women whose minds are not completely liberated and who have feelings of inferiority also have this concern.

Will it affect the basic work? No. On the contrary, precisely because of learning and mastering multiple skills, one can improve one's labor efficiency more quickly. People who farm will plant the fields better after having a little knowledge of soil and fertilizer. People who repair reservoirs, after learning the skills of a carpenter, can better use the tools when using them, and can repair or build their own tools when necessary.

After the establishment of the People's Commune, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishing developed simultaneously, and industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs were integrated. Therefore, it is even more necessary for every member to be both a farmer and a worker, and to learn several skills, to be both an agricultural researcher and an engineering technician. In order to fully utilize the role of people in production, male members need this, and female members also need this. Carrying out the "Skillful Girl" movement can realize the above requirements.

Carrying out the "Skillful Girl" movement, like carrying out the "all-rounder" and "universalist" movement, is actually not limited to improving labor productivity, but is to cultivate a group of laborers who are both red and expert from practice.

    培养又红又专的劳动者
    张克
    长治专区开展“巧姑娘”运动以来，已涌现出“巧姑娘”“巧媳妇”和“女土专家”十七万多人，这给农村突然增加了一大批多才多艺或者是精通某一项专业知识的“能手”或“土专家”。有了这批人，瘠薄的土地可以变为良田，不被人注意的杏干、李子制成了味美可口的青梅、杏酱、杏糕，从来没有汽车的农村有了自造的土汽车。更重要的，有了这批人，工农业生产方面的技术革新运动将更加广泛深入地展开。
    在过去，的确有很多事情妇女是干不了的。但那并不是由于妇女天生的笨拙，而是旧社会设下重重障碍，使得她们不能得到和男子同样学习的机会，因而在文化和技术上一般落后于男子。解放以后，束缚妇女的陈规已被逐渐扫除；大跃进以来，妇女们敢想敢干的共产主义风格普遍树立；特别是生活集体化以后，妇女们摆脱了繁重的家务劳动，已经走出家门和男人们一样地参加各种活动和劳动生产。正由于妇女们经受着长期的束缚，一旦彻底解脱，便会爆发出冲天干劲和无比的政治热情，敢于向一切困难作斗争，敢于尝试没有做过的新事。长治专区领导上正是懂得了这点，在发现高平县宋丑儿、王乐平、李春花三个“巧姑娘”典型以后，立即在全专区开展了“巧姑娘”运动。
    开展“巧姑娘”运动，当然会遇到旧社会遗留下来的各种轻视妇女观点的阻碍，如说：“男人还干不好，妇女怎能干好”，“不管你怎么巧，学一门手艺，总得三四年”。特别是有些人认为开展“巧姑娘”运动，会弄“巧”成“拙”，这也就是说会因开展这个运动而分散力量，影响本分工作。不单是有保守思想的人有此疑问，就是在一些思想没有完全解放、怀有自卑感的妇女中也存在这种顾虑。
    会不会影响本分工作呢？不会。相反的，正因为学习和学会了多种技术，能够更快地提高自己的劳动效率。种田的人，在有了稍许土壤、肥料知识以后，会把田种得更好。修水库的人，学会了木匠的本领以后，使用工具的时候，可以更好地发挥工具的作用，必要时可以自己修理工具或自造工具。
    人民公社成立后，农、林、牧、副、渔同时发展，工、农、商、学、兵互相结合。因此，更要求每个社员人人都是农民又都是工人，学会好几种本领，是农业研究员又是工程技术员。为了充分发挥人在生产中的作用。男社员需要这样，女社员也需要这样。开展“巧姑娘”运动，正可以实现上述的要求。
    开展“巧姑娘”运动和开展“多面手”、“万能手”运动一样，其意义实际上不限于提高劳动生产率，而是从实践中培养出一批又红又专的劳动者。
