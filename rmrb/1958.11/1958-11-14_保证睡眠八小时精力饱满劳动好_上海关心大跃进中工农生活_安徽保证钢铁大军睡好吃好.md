    Ensuring Eight Hours of Sleep for Energetic Labor
    Shanghai Cares for the Livelihood of Workers and Peasants During the Great Leap Forward; Anhui Guarantees the Iron and Steel Army Sleeps Well and Eats Well
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 13th—The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and party organizations at all levels have recently adopted various measures to ensure that workers and peasants working selflessly on all fronts sleep well, eat well, rest well, and live well, so that they are full of energy and can carry out production more persistently and rhythmically.
    Since the Great Leap Forward in production, especially the launch of the nationwide steelmaking campaign and the concentrated efforts in autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting, the labor army on all fronts of industry, agriculture, transportation, and capital construction in the city, in order to realize the Leap Forward plan and accelerate socialist construction, often disregards time, disregards remuneration, works day and night, and works selflessly. It has become very difficult for party organizations and leading cadres at all levels to persuade workers and peasants to rest on time. Many workers eat in the workshops and sleep in the workshops. Although the leaders repeatedly advise them to rest, they refuse. Sometimes they are "sent" out the front door, but run back in through the back door.
    On November 8, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party specially convened a meeting of the first secretaries of district committees and passed a "Decision on Ensuring Workers and Peasants Get Enough Sleep and Rest." The decision instructed party organizations at all levels to lead workers and peasants to properly arrange production and rest time, and in general, ensure eight hours of sleep. For young people, pregnant women, and the elderly and infirm, they should be proactively cared for and taken care of. The decision also pointed out that the tasks on all fronts are currently very heavy, and the main method to solve this problem is to fully mobilize the masses and vigorously carry out technological revolution, rather than working overtime. The Municipal Committee requires leading cadres at all levels in factories, enterprises, and people's communes in each county to formulate specific measures to ensure the rest time of workers and peasants based on their own actual conditions.
    Many factories in Shanghai, especially steel factories and machinery factories, have recently regarded caring for the lives and rest of workers as an important political task. Since August, the workers in the open-hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 have not had a weekly holiday. They guard the furnaces day and night, eating and sleeping with the furnaces. Those who are physically weak refuse to go home to rest. When they are really tired, they hide aside to doze off for a while and then throw themselves back into the battle. The general party branch of the workshop recently required all party members and members of the Communist Youth League to be responsible for checking on time every day, putting the workers on the transportation vehicles, and letting them go home to rest. At the same time, they persuade workers with poor health not to work overtime on Sundays. Factories such as Shanghai Machine Repair General Factory, Shipbuilding and Repair Factory, Boiler Factory, and Dalong Machine Factory have recently cleared out houses in the factories or let workers who live far from the factory live in collective dormitories in the factory to ensure that workers have more time to sleep.
    Making sure workers eat their fill, eat well, and stay healthy is also a matter of special concern to various factories. Chengfu Iron Factory designated the doctor from the clinic to lead the cafeteria to improve the nutrition of the dishes, and required the cafeteria to provide hot meals and hot food 24 hours a day.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 13th—All parts of Anhui Province are actively taking measures to ensure that the iron and steel army eats well, sleeps well, rests well, and labors well.
    The Provincial Party Committee Steel Plant, with more than 2,700 permanent workers, has formulated many specific methods to care for the lives of workers according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, ensuring that every worker can eat hot meals and hot food, and in general, ensuring that employees sleep for eight hours and have houses to live in. The Yuexi County Steel Second Division organized a transportation team of 3,000 people to transport living materials from the rear, so that the migrant workers who burn charcoal in the deep mountains can live in tents and eat well. More than 500 furnaces and more than 6,000 sandboxes that have been built by the entire division have been erected with wind and rain sheds, so that workers can carry out production regardless of wind and rain. They also transferred five sewing machines from the rear to prepare cotton clothes and distribute them to migrant workers in need. The First Battalion of the Second Regiment of Steel in Tongcheng County, in order to improve the lives of migrant workers, raised 51 pigs on the construction site, installed 14 tofu mills, and planted more than three mu of radishes and cabbage. Now the migrant workers have tofu and green vegetables to eat every day, meat once a week, and eat their fill for three meals a day without eating cold food. Because the life is well arranged, everyone in the entire battalion is full of energy. In the past month, the average amount of iron sand mined by each person in the entire battalion exceeded the quota by 129%.

    保证睡眠八小时精力饱满劳动好
    上海关心大跃进中工农生活　安徽保证钢铁大军睡好吃好
    据新华社上海13日电　中共上海市委和各级党组织最近采取多种措施，保证在各条战线上进行忘我劳动的工人、农民睡好、吃好、休息好、生活好，使他们精神饱满，能更持久地、有节奏地进行生产。
    生产大跃进，特别是展开了全民炼钢运动和突击进行秋收秋耕秋种以来，全市的工业、农业、交通运输和基本建设各条战线上的劳动大军，为了实现跃进计划，加速建设社会主义，经常不计时间、不计报酬、夜以继日、奋不顾身地忘我劳动，各级党组织和领导干部试图劝说工人、农民按时休息，也成为非常困难的事情。很多工人吃在车间、睡在车间，虽然领导再三劝他们休息，他们却不答应，有时前门“送”出，后门又跑了进来。
    中共上海市委在11月8日特地召开区委第一书记会议，通过了“关于保证工人、农民睡足歇好的决定”。决定指示各级党组织应当领导工人、农民妥善安排生产和休息时间，在一般情况下应该保证有八小时的睡眠时间。对青少年、孕妇及年老体弱的，更要主动关怀和照顾。决定还指出：目前各条战线的任务都很繁重，解决这个问题的主要方法是充分发动群众，大搞技术革命，而不是加班加点。市委要求各工厂、企业和各县人民公社各级领导干部，根据各自的实际情况，订出保证工人、农民休息时间的具体措施。
    上海许多工厂，特别是钢铁厂、机械厂，最近都把关心工人的生活和休息当做一项重要的政治任务来看待。上钢三厂平炉车间的工人从8月份起，没有过过星期例假，他们日夜守炉餐、伴炉眠，身体弱的也不肯回家休息，实在倦了就躲在一边打一会儿盹又投入战斗。车间党总支最近要求全体党团员负责每天按时检查，把工人送上交通车，让他们回家休息。同时劝阻身体差的工人不要在星期天加班。上海机修总厂、船舶修造厂、锅炉厂和大隆机器厂等厂，最近都在厂里腾出房屋，或是让住家离厂远的工人住进厂内集体宿舍，以保证工人有更多的时间睡眠。
    让工人吃饱、吃好、身体好也是各厂特别重视的问题。诚孚铁工厂指定由医务室的医生领导食堂改善菜肴营养，并且要求食堂做到日夜二十四小时都有热菜热饭供应。
    新华社合肥13日电　安徽省各地正在积极采取措施，保证钢铁大军吃好、睡好、休息好、劳动好。
    有二千七百多名固定工人的省委钢铁厂，根据省委指示，已经订出了许多关心工人生活的具体办法，做到每个工人能吃热饭热菜，一般情况下，保证职工睡八小时，有房子住。岳西县钢铁第二师组织了三千人的运输大队，专门从后方运输生活资料，使在深山里烧炭的民工都能住上帐篷，吃好饭。全师已建的五百多个炉子和六千多个砂箱，都已搭起风雨篷，使工人可以风雨无阻地进行生产。他们还从后方调来五部缝纫机，准备缝制棉衣，发给有困难的民工。桐城县钢铁二团一营，为了改善民工的生活，在工地上养了五十一口猪，安了十四个豆腐磨，种了三亩多萝卜、白菜。现在民工们每天都有豆腐、青菜吃，一周吃一次肉，每天三餐吃得饱，不吃冷饭。因为生活安排的好，全营人人干劲足，一个月来，全营平均每人淘铁砂量超过了定额129％。
