Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th: More and more materials confirm that the so-called negotiations between the United States and the Nobusuke Kishi government behind the scenes to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" are actually a major conspiracy to turn Japan into an accomplice in the U.S. aggression in the Western Pacific region.

According to a recent report in the "Nihon Keizai Shimbun," the Nobusuke Kishi government said that U.S. Ambassador to Japan Douglas MacArthur II, when holding the second meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama on amending the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" on October 22, put forward the U.S. draft treaty. He said that this draft, entitled "U.S.-Japan Mutual Defense Treaty," "expands the treaty area to the Western Pacific, in line with the mutual defense treaties signed by the United States with the Philippines, Taiwan, and South Korea." He revealed that the U.S. and Japan conducted negotiations on this draft as a basis at that time.

The "Nihon Keizai Shimbun" reported the main contents of this draft treaty. Although the clauses are full of words like "peace" and "security," they cannot hide the treaty's aggressive nature. The "preamble" of the draft treaty stipulates that the United States and Japan should actively strengthen their military alliance in the Western Pacific region. According to the clauses, they should "strengthen the 'peace mechanism' in the Western Pacific region" and "strengthen (U.S.-Japan) efforts in collective defense."

The "main text" of the draft treaty stipulates that "the territory and area mentioned in this treaty refers to the mainland of Japan and its affiliated islands under Japanese jurisdiction, as well as Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands, which Japan is considered to have potential sovereignty over; on the U.S. side, it refers to the islands in the Western Pacific that it actually governs and owns."

The "main text" of the draft treaty also stipulates that "both countries declare that (both countries) consider armed attacks on the mainland of Japan and its territories, as well as on the United States responsible for defending Japan, to be actions endangering their own peace and security; and will take action to deal with common dangers in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Constitution."

These provisions, which are exactly the same as the U.S.-Chiang and U.S.-Syngman Rhee military treaties, show that Japan must participate in the aggressive wars launched by U.S. imperialism in the Far East, and illustrate the true purpose of Nobusuke Kishi's eagerness to amend the Japanese Constitution, especially to abolish the clause on renouncing war in the Constitution.

The draft treaty reaffirmed Japan's status as a U.S. war base. It stipulates that "in order to contribute to the cause of defending the Japanese region and maintaining peace and security in the Western Pacific region, Japan allows the deployment of U.S. military forces deemed necessary in and around Japan, and has the right to use bases for this purpose; the United States will accept this."

In order to deceive the Japanese people who resolutely oppose the United States using Japanese bases to wage war, the draft treaty used the meaningless rhetoric often used by Nobusuke Kishi, that is, the use and deployment of U.S. troops must be "consulted in advance."

The unanimous wish of the Japanese people to oppose the United States from transporting nuclear weapons into Japan was not mentioned in the draft treaty at all.

### 使日本充当侵略走卒  把日本永作军事基地  美国提出修改日美“安全条约”草案

    使日本充当侵略走卒  把日本永作军事基地
    美国提出修改日美“安全条约”草案
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：愈来愈多的材料证实，美国和岸信介政府在幕后进行的所谓修改日美“安全条约”的谈判，实际上是一个要使日本充当美国侵略西太平洋地区的走卒的大阴谋。
    据“日本经济新闻”最近报道，据岸信介政府的人士说，美国驻日本大使麦克阿瑟第二在10月22日同日本外务相藤山爱一郎就关于修改日美“安全条约”举行第二次会谈时，提出了美国方面的条约草案。他说，这个名为“日美共同防御条约”的草案“把适用条约地区扩大到西太平洋，向美国同菲律宾、台湾、韩国所签订的共同防御条约看齐”。他透露，当时日美双方以这个草约为基础进行了谈判。
    “日本经济新闻”报道了这个条约草案的主要内容。尽管条文中充满了“和平”和“安全”的字眼，但是，它们并不能掩饰条约的侵略实质。条约草案的“前文”就规定美日双方要积极在西太平洋地区加强军事同盟，按照条文的说法是：“加强西太平洋地区的‘和平机构’”；要“加强（日美）两国在集体防御方面的努力”。
    草约“本文”规定，“本条约所提到的领土、领域，在日本方面是指日本本部和在日本管辖下的附属各岛以及日本被认为有潜在主权的冲绳、小笠原各岛；在美国方面是指实际上在它管辖下的它领有的西太平洋各岛。”
    草约“本文”还规定，“两国宣布，（两国）认为对日本本部及其领域以及对负责保卫着日本的美国进行的武装进攻，都是危及本国的和平和安全的行动；并且将根据宪法规定的程序，为了对付共同的危险而采取行动。”
    这些与美蒋、美李军事条约如出一辙的规定表明，日本必须参加美帝国主义在远东发动的侵略战争，并且说明了岸信介急于修改日本宪法，特别是急于废除宪法中关于放弃战争的条款的真正目的。
    草约再次肯定了日本作为美国战争基地的地位。它规定，“为了对保卫日本地区和维护西太平洋地区的和平和安全的事业有所贡献，日本允许被认为是必需的美军兵力部署在日本国内及其周围，并且有权为此而利用基地；美国将予以接受。”
    为了欺骗坚决反对美国利用日本基地进行战争的日本人民，草约中沿用了岸信介所常用的毫无实际意义说法，即：美军的使用和部署要“事先协商”。
    日本人民反对美国把核武器运进日本的一致愿望，草约中一个字也没有提到。
