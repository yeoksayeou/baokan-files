(Dispatch from our newspaper in Shenyang on the 14th) The workers in the machinery factories of Liaoning Province have greatly broken with old conventions, launched a crash program for more than two months, and have basically completed the manufacturing task of rolling mill equipment for this year. At present, all thirty-two sets of rolling mill equipment that the province is rushing to manufacture for various parts of the country, except for nine sets of medium-sized rolling mills that have not yet been manufactured, have been completed and delivered ahead of schedule and shipped to various places. Once all of this batch of rolling mill equipment is completed, it can increase the country's steel rolling capacity by 4 million tons per year.

According to the state's plan, the manufacturing task of rolling mill equipment undertaken by Liaoning Province should be completed by the end of this year or the beginning of next year; but now it can be completed ahead of schedule in November. This is mainly because: Party organizations at all levels have adopted revolutionary measures, launched a mass movement in a big way, broken with conventions and regulations, and overcome various difficulties such as small equipment, lack of experience, and insufficient supply of raw materials.

In the process of manufacturing this batch of rolling mill equipment, the biggest problem encountered was how to manufacture large machines with small equipment. This batch of rolling mill equipment is bulky and heavy, and the parts are very large, and they have not been manufactured before. Some steel castings weigh more than ten tons; while the electric furnaces in various factories are small and can only melt a few tons of molten steel at a time, making it impossible to produce steel castings weighing more than ten tons. In order to solve this contradiction, the workers launched a great debate to refute the superstitious idea that small equipment cannot do big jobs. The workers in the steel casting workshop of the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory, through a great debate, proposed the revolutionary method of "using a teapot to cook a pig's head" to make large parts of the rolling mill with small and simple casting equipment. The experience of this factory was immediately spread throughout the province, enabling many factories to double the production capacity of casting equipment and solve the difficulty of small electric furnaces not being able to smelt enough molten steel. Some factories also adopted electroslag welding methods to transform large into small and small into large to make large castings and large forgings. When processing large parts, all factories mobilized the masses to use the method of "ants gnawing at bones" to make their own indigenous machine tools and special equipment. Some small factories in Shenyang City, which only had some belt-driven lathes, also made their own indigenous equipment to manufacture large parts of the rolling mill.

In order to rush to manufacture rolling mill equipment, the province also broke the old method of supplying raw materials and solved the difficulty of insufficient steel supply. As the amount of steel allocated by the state was small and could only meet 60% of the needs, especially in terms of variety and time, it was difficult to meet the requirements. Therefore, all localities relied on the masses, relied on their own efforts, opened warehouses, and launched an "anti-drought" movement. The province has excavated 500,000 tons of scrap steel, which has solved part of the difficulty of insufficient steel supply. At present, various localities are also adopting cooperative methods of mutual support and mutual exchange to make up for the lack of certain material specifications and varieties.

(Dispatch from our newspaper in Shanghai on the 14th) After Shanghai's machinery manufacturing industry rushed to complete a large number of iron and steel smelting equipment, in order to quickly turn steel into usable material, it is now concentrating its efforts on rushing to manufacture a batch of rolling mill equipment with an annual steel production capacity of 4,310,000 tons. These rolling mill equipment include blooming mills, medium plate mills, thin plate mills, seamless steel pipe mills, silicon steel sheet mills, and rolling mills for rolling various medium and small steel products, a total of forty sets, which are urgently needed by steel plants in Shanghai, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan and other places. The entire plan will be completed this winter and next spring. Up to now, six sets of rolling mills, including medium plate, thin plate, and seamless steel pipe, have been basically completed, and another twenty-five sets are being processed and rushed to manufacture.

Manufacturing complete sets of rolling mill equipment involves a large workload and complex technology. A set of medium-sized steel plate rolling mill with an annual output of 200,000 tons has more than 20 mechanical items, with a total weight of 2,000 tons, requiring 200,000 man-hours of processing. Some of the large parts and gears alone weigh more than ten to dozens of tons each. In order to complete such an arduous task in a short period of time, more than 400 machinery manufacturing factories have been organized around more than 20 large factories to cooperate in production. At the same time, all factories have also launched a vigorous mass movement, carried out technical revolutions in a big way, used various indigenous methods, and created a large number of special indigenous machine tools and indigenous equipment to overcome difficulties in processing and manufacturing.

In casting large parts such as rolling mill gear housings and gearboxes weighing dozens of tons, many factories do not have such large lifting and molding equipment. The workers adopted various methods of transforming large into small and small into large. When casting a 50-ton herringbone gear housing, the Shanghai Foundry improved the design structure, divided the gear housing into two pieces for molding, and then tightened them with screws, with very good quality. All factories have also universally adopted the method of "ants gnawing at bones" to process large parts.

The most difficult part of manufacturing this batch of rolling mills is the processing of various large herringbone gears and coupling gears. Because of the lack of suitable machine tools to use, many factories have modified old gantry milling machines and crankshaft lathes. The Jiangnan Shipyard modified a gear hobbing machine with a load capacity of only six to eight tons and used it to process large herringbone gears weighing 14 tons and with a diameter of 3 meters, increasing efficiency by six times. A large gantry milling machine in the Jingye Machinery Factory was modified to cut gears with five tools simultaneously, increasing efficiency by twelve times. The herringbone coupling gear weighs more than ten tons and is as long as three meters, making processing even more difficult. However, the workers of the Shanghai Gear Factory have already designed and manufactured a simple horizontal indigenous hobbing machine, which is very efficient in processing.

In order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient equipment capacity, a huge movement to manufacture indigenous machine tools is also vigorously developing. The mechanical factories have proposed that they will make 3,500 indigenous machine tools this winter and next spring, including large machine tools such as a 15-meter gantry planer and a 6.5-meter vertical lathe.

    赶制轧钢设备　迅速使钢成材
    辽宁已有二十三套轧钢设备提前制成运往全国各地
    上海四百多工厂组织协作战胜加工制造的各种困难
    本报沈阳14日电　辽宁省机械工厂职工大破陈规，突击两个多月，已经基本上完成今年轧钢设备的制造任务。现在全省为全国各地赶制的三十二套轧钢设备，除了九套中型轧钢机尚未制成外，都已经成套地提前交活，运往各地。这批轧钢设备全部制成以后，可以为国家增加年产四百万吨钢材的轧钢能力。
    根据国家的计划，辽宁省担负的轧钢设备的制造任务，应该在今年年底或者明年年初完成；但是现在可以提前在11月完成。这主要是因为：各级党组织采取革命措施，大搞群众运动，破除清规戒律，战胜了设备小，经验缺乏和原材料供应不上等种种困难。
    在制造这批轧钢设备的过程中，遇到的最大问题是怎样以小设备制造大机器。这批轧钢设备体积较重，部件很大，过去都没有制造过。有些铸钢件重达十几吨；而各厂的电炉小，一次只能熔炼几吨钢水，搞不成十几吨重的铸钢件。职工们为了解决这个矛盾，展开大辩论，驳倒小设备不能干大活的迷信观点。沈阳矿山机器厂铸钢车间工人通过大辩论，提出以“茶壶煮猪头”的革命方法，用小型的简陋的铸造设备，制成轧钢机上的大部件。这个厂的经验立刻传遍全省，使得许多工厂成倍地提高铸造设备的生产能力，解决了小电炉不能多炼钢水的困难。有些厂还采用电渣焊方法，化大为小，以小并大，制成大铸件，大锻件。在加工大部件的时候，各厂都发动群众利用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法，自制土机床，专用设备。沈阳市有些小型工厂，只有一些皮带车床，也自搞土设备制成轧钢机上的大部件。
    全省为了赶制轧钢设备，还打破了老一套的原材料供应方法，解决钢材供应不足的困难。由于国家调拨的钢材数量少，只能满足60％的需要，尤其是在品种上时间上很难满足要求，因此各地都依靠群众，自力更生，打开仓库，开展“抗旱”运动。全省已挖掘出五十万吨废钢铁，解决了一部分钢材供应不足的困难。目前各地还在采取互相支援、互通有无的协作方式，补足某些材料规格品种不全的缺陷。
    本报上海14日电　上海市机械制造工业在突击完成大批炼铁炼钢设备之后，为了迅速使钢成材，目前正集中力量赶制一批年产钢材能力达四百三十一万吨的轧钢设备。这些轧钢设备包括开坯机、中板机、薄板机、无缝钢管机、矽钢片机和轧制各种中小型钢材的轧钢机共四十套，都是上海、山东、江苏、浙江、安徽、江西、福建、湖南等地钢铁厂迫切需要的。全部计划将在今冬明春完成。到目前止，已基本完成的轧钢机有中板、薄板、无缝钢管等六套，另有二十五套正在加工赶制。
    制造成套的轧钢设备工作量大，技术复杂。一套年产二十万吨中型钢板的轧钢机共有二十多项机械，总重量达两千吨，加工要二十万工时，单是其中一些大的零件和齿轮，每件就有十多吨到几十吨重。为了要在短时期内完成这样艰巨的任务，已经有四百多家机械制造厂以二十多个大厂为中心组织起来，协作生产。同时，各厂还开展了轰轰烈烈的群众运动，大搞技术革命，运用各种各样的土办法，创造了大批专用的土机床、土设备，克服加工制造中的困难。
    铸造几十吨重的轧钢机齿轮架、齿轮箱等大型零件，许多厂都没有那么大的起重和翻砂设备，工人们就采取了各种以大化小、以小并大的办法。上海铸造厂在浇铸五十吨重的人字齿轮架时，改进了设计结构，把齿轮架分成两片翻砂，然后用螺丝旋紧，质量很好。各厂还普遍采用了“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法加工大零件。
    制造这批轧钢机中最困难的部分是加工各种大型的人字齿轮和连轴齿轮。因为缺少适当的机床可以使用，许多厂就用旧的龙门铣床、曲轴车床加以改装。江南造船厂将一台负荷能力只有六吨到八吨的滚齿机床改装后，用来加工重十四吨、直径三公尺的大人字齿轮，效率提高六倍，精业机器厂的一台大龙门铣床改成用五把刀同时切削齿轮，效率提高十二倍。人字连轴齿轮重十多吨，长达三公尺，加工更加困难。但是，上海齿轮厂职工已经由自己设计制造了一台简易的卧式土滚床，加工的效率很高。
    为了克服设备力量不足的困难，一个规模巨大的制造土机床运动还在蓬勃开展。各机械厂已提出今冬明春要自造三千五百台土机床，其中有十五公尺大龙门刨和六公尺半大立车等大型机床。
