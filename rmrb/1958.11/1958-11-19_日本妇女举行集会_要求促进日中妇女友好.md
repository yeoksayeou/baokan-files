Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 18th: The Japan-China Women's Exchange Association and the "Welcome Executive Committee for the Chinese Women's Delegation" jointly held a lecture meeting in Tokyo last night to promote Japan-China women's friendship. More than 800 women who attended the lecture listened to speeches by Kenzo Nakajima, Yoshitaro Hirano, Yuko Mochizuki, and others.

Nakajima strongly condemned Kishi Nobusuke's policy of hostility towards China in his speech, and pointed out that this was a policy of selling out Japan, which would bring disaster to the Japanese nation. Nakajima said that today's China is no longer the China of the past. If the United States and Japan dare to launch a war of aggression against China, they will inevitably be completely crushed by the powerful Chinese people.

Nakajima called on the Japanese people to further unite and strive to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations. Nakajima said that this would help Japan move towards a path of peace, independence, and prosperity.

Yoshitaro Hirano emphasized in his speech the importance of the joint statement issued not long ago by the Japan-China Friendship Association delegation and the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations delegation that visited China with relevant Chinese organizations, and explained in detail the great leap forward in various aspects of China and the development of people's communes.

Yuko Mochizuki emphasized the importance of the friendship between the peoples of Japan and China in her speech. Wonderful programs such as Chinese folk dances were also performed at the meeting.

    要求促进日中妇女友好
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：日中妇女交流会和“中国妇女代表团欢迎实行委员会”昨天晚间在东京联合举行促进日中妇女友好讲演会。参加讲演会的八百多名妇女听取了中岛健藏、平野义太郎、望月优子等人的讲演。
    中岛在讲演中强烈谴责岸信介敌视中国的政策，并且指出这是出卖日本的政策，它将为日本民族招致灾难。中岛说，今天的中国已经不是从前的中国，如果美国和日本胆敢对中国发动侵略战争，势必被强大的中国人民彻底粉碎。
    中岛号召日本人民进一步团结起来，努力打开日中关系的僵局。中岛说，这样会有助于使日本走向和平、独立、繁荣的道路。
    平野义太郎在讲演中强调了不久以前访问中国的日中友协代表团和恢复日中邦交国民会议代表团同中国有关团体发表的共同声明的重要意义，并且详细说明了中国各方面大跃进和人民公社的发展情况。
    望月优子在讲演中强调日中两国人民的友谊的重要性。会上还表演了中国民间舞蹈等精采节目。
