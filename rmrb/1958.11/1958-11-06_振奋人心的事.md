    An Inspiring Thing
    Think about it, what an inspiring thing this is! The film "Huang Baomei," performed by our own workers, was still in its immature stages of gestation four months ago, and today, this film with a novel style has already met us. Our workers are also very enthusiastic about making movies.
    When the workers of our State-owned No. 17 Cotton Mill see the film "Huang Baomei," their feelings of pride and happiness are doubled. Huang Baomei is from our factory, and her deeds and her person appear on the screen, while also bringing the leap forward spirit of our State-owned No. 17 Cotton Mill to the audience.
    "Huang Baomei" makes us once again excitedly recall the battle on March 13th of this year. In that overnight hard fight, our No. 17 Cotton Mill workers created more than fifty miracles overnight. The Huang Baomei group only used four and a half hours to eliminate the white spots in the fine yarn splicing, gloriously fulfilling their guarantee. Huang Baomei, this fine yarn female worker who grew up under the cultivation of the Party, had just returned from the trade union to her original production post not long ago, and she and her group erected a red flag! The film "Huang Baomei" records this battle, and it is very real.
    After watching "Huang Baomei," I once had a thought: in the entire film, Huang Baomei as a person does not seem prominent enough. But later, the words of another comrade enlightened me: everything about Huang Baomei, including her advanced thoughts and advanced deeds, is inseparable from her collective!

    振奋人心的事
    想想看，这是件多么振奋人心的事！由我们工人自己演的影片“黄宝妹”，在四个月前，还在不成熟的酝酿中，今天，这部风格新颖的影片已经跟我们见面了。我们工人在拍电影这件事上的干劲，也是很足的。
    我们国棉十七厂工人看到“黄宝妹”这部电影，骄傲和幸福的感情是双倍的。黄宝妹是我们厂里的，她的事迹和她本人出现在银幕上，也同时把我们国棉十七厂的跃进风貌带给观众了。
    “黄宝妹”使我们又一次激动地想起今年3月13日那一场战斗。在那一次通宵苦战里，我们十七厂工人一夜间创造了五十多个奇迹，黄宝妹小组只用了四小时半时间，就消灭了细纱接头白点，光辉地实现了她们的保证。黄宝妹，这个在党培养下成长起来的细纱女工，刚刚从工会里回到原来的生产岗位上不久，就和她的小组竖起了一面红旗！电影“黄宝妹”记录了这场战斗，是非常真实的。
    看了“黄宝妹”以后，我曾经转过一个念头：在整个电影里，黄宝妹这个人似乎不够突出。但是后来，另一位同志的话使我受到启发：黄宝妹这个人身上的一切，包括她的先进思想和先进事迹，都是和她的集体分不开的啊！
