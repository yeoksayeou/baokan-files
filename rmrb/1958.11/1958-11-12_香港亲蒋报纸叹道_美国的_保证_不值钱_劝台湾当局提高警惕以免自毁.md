Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, November 11th. Hong Kong's pro-Chiang newspapers continued to attack US Assistant Secretary of State Parsons' reply to the Taiwan groups today.

"Natural Daily" said that the current US-Chiang relations are in a "shaky" situation. This pro-Chiang newspaper believes that "the United States may have the intention of selling out Free China (Chiang Kai-shek's group)." It advises the Taiwan authorities to "heighten vigilance", otherwise, they will "stage a self-destructive tragedy of the 1960s."

"Sing Tao Daily" 's editorial today expressed resentment against the United States for bullying the Taiwan authorities, believing that the Taiwan authorities always "fail" when dealing with the United States. It said that taking recent examples, the Chiang-Dulles talks communiqué was a "major diplomatic failure" for the Taiwan authorities. "Because we were forced by our American allies to give up the armed counterattack against the mainland. Isn't this the biggest failure?" The editorial said that the Kuomintang authorities' "diplomacy with the United States has not been successful in the past twenty years... Thinking about this, it is truly chilling!"

"Universal Daily" said, "To understand the true value of Eisenhower's guarantee, one must investigate the recent credit of the bounced checks he has repeatedly issued." It then listed some facts about US-Chiang relations, explaining that the "guarantee" made by the United States to Chiang Kai-shek's group was just a "dishonored check."

"Nanyang Daily" expressed "gratitude" for the hypocritical "guarantee" made by the US President. But it then said that the United States has "made many arrangements that harm others without benefiting itself" in recent years, criticizing the United States' "compromising" attitude, which "implicitly made arrangements that damage the interests of the Republic of China (Chiang Kai-shek's group)."

    香港亲蒋报纸叹道
    美国的“保证”不值钱
    劝台湾当局提高警惕以免自毁
    新华社香港11日电　香港亲蒋报纸今天继续抨击美国助理国务卿帮办帕森斯给台湾团体的复信。
    “自然日报”说，目前美蒋关系。正陷于“摇曳”的处境。这家亲蒋报纸认为“美国可能会有出卖自由中国（蒋介石集团）的意图”。它劝告台湾当局“提高警惕”，否则，将会“演出二十世纪六十年代自我毁灭大悲剧。”
    “星岛日报”今天的社论对美国欺压台湾当局表示愤愤不平，认为台湾当局同美国打交道总是“失败”的。它说，拿最近的事例来说，蒋杜会谈公报就是台湾当局“外交上一大失败。因为我们被美国盟友所迫，要放弃武力反攻大陆。这不是最大失败而何？社论说，国民党当局的“对美外交，二十年来，未曾搞好过。……言念及此，真是令人不寒而栗！”
    “环球报”说，“要了解艾森豪威尔这种保证的真实价值如何，就必须追研他一再所开出的口头支票最近信用”。它接着列举了一些美蒋关系的事实，说明美国对蒋介石集团所作的“保证”只不过是一纸“不兑现的支票”。
    “南洋日报”对美国总统所作的虚伪“保证”表示“感激”。但它接着就说，美国这几年来“许多回作出了损人而不利己之安排”，它批评美国的“妥协”态度，“无形中便作出了损害中华民国（蒋介石集团）权益之安排”。
