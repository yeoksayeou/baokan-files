Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 17th: By the night of the 15th, farmers in Heilongjiang Province, with a rural population of only nine million, had delivered 9.32 billion jin (excluding potatoes) of procured grain, exceeding this year's grain procurement task more than two months ahead of schedule. The vast majority of the delivered grain is of superior quality. Except for a small portion of increased production and increased procurement reserved by various special districts and counties, all of it has been sent to the state granaries.

The speed of Heilongjiang Province's grain procurement and storage work is unprecedented. At the end of October, only 12.6% of the province's grain procurement task had been completed. A concentrated effort began in early November. In the first ten days of the month, the average daily grain storage increased from 40 million jin in late October to 205 million jin. In the final five-day decisive battle from November 11th to 15th, 1.28 billion jin of grain was stored in the first two days; then 1.83 billion jin was reached in the next two days; and on the last day, the grain stored leaped to 2.47 billion jin.

The Provincial Party Committee, based on the principle of "let, aid, squeeze," made comprehensive arrangements for production work and grain work. In the first stage of the grain procurement work before November, the Provincial Party Committee proposed taking deep plowing as the center of rural work, ensuring both plowing and grain procurement. The financial and trade departments made way for deep plowing work, supporting deep plowing with timber, steel, and manpower to vigorously support various regions in manufacturing rope-drawn plows, while also seizing the time to purchase grain. The financial and trade departments vigorously supported deep plowing in order to prepare for the concentrated grain delivery, and the concentrated grain delivery in turn strived for more time for the upsurge in water conservancy construction. Starting in November, most counties had basically completed their deep plowing tasks, and were in a condition to spare manpower and animal power for threshing and delivering grain, and the first upsurge in grain delivery began to take shape. On October 22nd, the Bajiazi People's Commune in Wuchang County completed its deep plowing and grain delivery tasks. The Provincial Party Committee immediately summarized this experience, and the Provincial People's Committee issued a circular commending it and awarding it a banner, calling on rural areas throughout the province to learn from this commune. Immediately afterwards, Wuchang County challenged all counties in the province, with the condition of ensuring the completion of deep plowing and grain procurement tasks before November 10th. This both accelerated the progress of grain delivery and promoted deep plowing. When deep plowing had been completed throughout the province, with only a small number of high-yield satellite fields needing further deep plowing, and large-scale water conservancy construction was preparing equipment and designs, the Provincial Party Committee seized this gap and launched a massive grain delivery upsurge throughout the province. The small movement became a large movement. Only a small, capable force was left to make up for the deep plowing and prepare for water conservancy projects, while the rest of the vast army threw themselves into the threshing and grain delivery movement. In the grain delivery, communist cooperation was carried out between cities and rural areas, and between communes. Cities supported rural areas, communes with abundant labor and animal power supported those with less, nearby communes supported distant ones, and those that had completed their tasks supported those that had not. The state granaries receiving grain also cooperated closely with the masses delivering grain. They handed over the work of weighing and inspecting the quality of the procured grain to peasant inspectors trained by the grain depots. This meant that although there were many people delivering grain this year, it was possible to ensure that people did not wait and horses did not stop.

Now, in addition to continuing to do a good job in grain work, Heilongjiang Province is taking a three-day break to recuperate and prepare to launch a comprehensive upsurge in water conservancy construction and other winter production, to prepare for next year's production. (Attached chart)

### “让、援、挤”——生产、粮食工作巧安排  黑龙江征购粮全部入库

    “让、援、挤”——生产、粮食工作巧安排
    黑龙江征购粮全部入库
    据新华社哈尔滨17日电　到15日夜间，只有九百万农村人口的黑龙江省的农民已经送交了九十三亿二千万斤（不包括薯类）征购粮，比往年提前两个多月超额完成了今年征购粮任务。送交的粮食绝大部分都是上等粮。其中除少数增产增购的部分由各专区、县储备以外，全部都已送进国家粮库。
    黑龙江省粮食征购入库工作速度之快，是空前的。10月末，全省征购粮任务才完成12.6％。11月初开始突击，上旬十天平均日入库粮由10月下旬的四千万斤增加到两亿零五百万斤。11月11日到15日最后五天决战，前两天，入库粮食十二亿八千万斤；接着两天达到十八亿三千万斤；最后一天入库粮食竟飞跃到二十四亿七千万斤。
    省委根据“让、援、挤”的方针，对生产工作和粮食工作做了全面安排。在11月前征购粮工作的第一阶段，省委提出以深翻地为农村工作中心，翻地、征购粮两不误。财贸工作部门给翻地工作让路，支援翻地工作，以木材、钢铁、人力大力支援各地制造绳索牵引犁，同时抓紧收购粮食。财贸部门大力支援深翻地，就是为了给突击送粮做准备，突击送粮又是给兴修水利高潮争取更多的时间。11月开始，大部分县深翻地任务基本成完，有条件抽出人畜力打场送粮，第一个送粮高潮就开始形成。五常县八家子人民公社10月22日完成了深翻、送粮任务，省委立即进行总结，省人民委员会通令嘉奖，并授予奖旗，号召全省农村向这个公社看齐。紧接着五常县以保证11月10日前完成深翻地和征购粮任务为条件，向全省各县挑战。这样既加快了送粮进度，又推动了深翻地。当全省深翻地已经结束，只有部分高产卫星田需要加深补翻，大规模水利建设正在准备器材和设计的时候，省委便抓住这个空隙，发动全省声势浩大的送粮高潮，小运动变成了大运动，翻地补课和准备水利工程只留下小部分精干的人马，其余千军万马一齐投入打场送粮运动。在送粮中，城市与农村、各公社之间都展开了共产主义协作。城市支援农村、劳畜力多的公社支援劳畜力少的，近距离的公社支援远距离的，已经完成任务的支援没有完成任务的。接收粮食的国家粮库也与送粮食的群众进行密切的合作。他们将征购粮时的过秤、检验质量的工作，全部交给由粮栈培训的农民检验员。这就使今年送粮人马虽然很多，却能做到人不等待，马不停蹄。
    现在，黑龙江省除了继续做好粮食工作以外，正休兵三天，养精蓄锐，准备发动全面的水利建设高潮以及其他冬季生产，为明年生产作好准备。（附图表）
