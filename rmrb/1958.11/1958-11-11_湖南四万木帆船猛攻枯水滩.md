Xinhua News Agency report: In Hunan Province, where rivers are like a net, a fleet of sailboats capable of carrying more than 370,000 tons had completed over 9.57 million tons of transportation by mid-October, exceeding the total for the entire previous year by more than 320,000 tons. Now, the dry season has arrived. Various localities are vigorously carrying out projects such as dredging beaches, building dams, and guiding floods, and are also adopting measures such as mechanizing winch operations on beaches and organizing "small boats to climb mountains" to vigorously attack the critical juncture of dry riverbeds and dangerous shoals, striving to complete the annual water transport plan ahead of schedule and exceed the target.

The total length of sailboat waterways in Hunan Province is more than 10,000 kilometers. The province has nearly 40,000 sailboats, and these sailboats undertake approximately 70% of the province's total transportation tasks each year.

    湖南四万木帆船猛攻枯水滩
    据新华社讯　在河流如网的湖南省，一支能载重三十七万多吨的帆船队伍，到10月中旬止，已完成九百五十七万多吨运输量，比去年全年还多三十二万多吨。现在，枯水位季节到了。各地正在大力进行疏滩、筑坝、导洪工程，并且采取上滩绞车化、组织“小船上山”等措施，猛攻水枯滩险关，力争提前超额完成全年水运计划。
    湖南省帆船航道全长一万多公里。全省拥有近四万只帆船，这些帆船每年担负的运输任务，占全省运输总量的70％左右。
