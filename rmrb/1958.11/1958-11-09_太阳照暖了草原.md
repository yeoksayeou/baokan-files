    The sun warms the grassland. The sun warms the grassland and illuminates our hearts. Horses are rejoicing, sheep are singing, our people are prosperous and livestock are thriving. Ah! Beloved leader Chairman Mao, you are the sun in our hearts. Even if we forget everything we have eaten in our lives, we will never forget our mother's milk. Even if we forget everything we have heard in our lives, we will never forget Chairman Mao's kindness.
          ——Tajik Folk Song

    太阳照暖了草原太阳照暖了草原，也照亮了我们的心。马儿在欢腾，羊儿在歌唱，我们人旺畜也旺。啊！敬爱的领袖毛主席，你就是我们心上的太阳。把一生吃过的东西都忘了，也忘不了母亲的奶汁，把一生听过的话全忘了，也忘不了毛主席的恩情。
          ——塔吉克民歌
