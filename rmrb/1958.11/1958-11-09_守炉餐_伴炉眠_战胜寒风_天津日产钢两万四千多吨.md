    Guarding the Furnace, Dining by the Furnace, Sleeping by the Furnace, Conquering the Bitter Cold
    Tianjin's Daily Steel Production Reaches Over 24,000 Tons
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 7th. To celebrate the October Revolution, the people of Tianjin mobilized a steel army of over 1.2 million people. From 12:00 on the 6th to 12:00 on the 7th, they produced a total of 24,828 tons of steel in 24 hours, of which 22,536 tons were produced by indigenous methods.
    The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Party organizations at all levels made full preparations for this high-yield day. All units held meetings of steelmakers to exchange experiences. Each furnace group organized professional teams and groups to study and improve techniques, strengthen cooperation between furnace groups, and improve production organization and on-site management. To solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, all districts also launched a large-scale campaign to collect scrap steel, collecting 35,537 tons from the 1st to the present.
    The masses participating in the steel-grabbing battle were in high spirits. Although a biting northwest wind of force six or seven invaded Tianjin from noon on the 6th, the steelmaking army and logistics troops still guarded the furnace, dined by the furnace, and slept by the furnace, conquering the bitter cold with strong will. In the process of steelmaking, the broad masses continuously improved their techniques, and a large number of new records for increasing steel output, reducing coal consumption, and extending furnace life appeared. The workers of the Red Flag Chemical Plant's "Long-Life Furnace," which had continuously produced steel 234 times, produced steel 85 times in a row during the high-yield period. They are preparing to achieve the goal of producing steel 500 times without repairing the furnace.

    守炉餐　伴炉眠　战胜寒风
    天津日产钢两万四千多吨
    新华社天津7日电　天津市人民为庆祝十月革命节，从6日十二时到7日十二时，出动了一百二十多万人的钢铁大军，二十四小时中共炼钢达二万四千八百二十八吨，其中土钢为二万二千五百三十六吨。
    中共天津市委员会和各级党组织为了组织这次高产日，事先作了充分的准备工作。各单位都召开了炼钢人员的会议，交流了经验，各炉群组织了专业队、组，研究改进技术，加强炉群之间的协作，改善了生产组织工作和现场的管理。为了解决原材料不足的困难，各区还展开了大规模的收集废钢铁运动，从1日到现在已收集了三万五千五百三十七吨。
    参加夺钢战斗的群众情绪高涨，虽然从6日中午起，寒冷逼人的六、七级西北风侵入天津市，但是炼钢大军和后勤部队，依然守炉餐，伴炉眠，以坚强意志，战胜了寒风。广大群众在炼钢中不断改进技术，提高出钢率、降低煤耗和延长炉龄的新纪录大量出现。连续出钢二百三十四次的红旗化工厂“长寿炉”的职工们，在高产期间又连续出钢八十五次。他们准备达到出钢五百次不修炉的目标。
