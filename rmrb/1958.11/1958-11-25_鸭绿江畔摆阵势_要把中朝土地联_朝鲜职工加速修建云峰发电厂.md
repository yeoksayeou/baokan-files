Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd: This reporter reports: During a recent visit to the Yunfeng Power Plant construction site, a joint project between China and North Korea on the Yalu River, I saw Korean workers engaged in a fervent labor campaign to complete their assigned task of building the power plant's dam one year ahead of schedule, by September 1961.

Near Yunfeng-ri in North Korea, the Yalu River flows through steep mountains, forming a large "Z" shape. The labor force of the First Construction Company of the Korean Ministry of Electricity will build a dam 845 meters long and 112 meters high at the last stroke of this "Z" to form an artificial lake more than 120 kilometers long upstream of the Yalu River. This will create a drop of 115 meters near the power plant, allowing an average of 1,000 cubic meters of water per second from the Yalu River to flow into a mountain cave carved on the north bank of the Yalu River. This will drive six generators with a total generating capacity of 600,000 kilowatts, which are being built by the Chinese side, before flowing back into the river.

The dam being built by the Korean workers requires 3.04 million cubic meters of concrete, which is more than the famous Supung Dam. The labor force of the Korean construction company, which is now undertaking this arduous project, has set up battle formations on both banks of the Yalu River and is actively carrying out preparations before the formal construction begins.

At the foot of the mountain on the south bank of the river, 24 collective dormitories that can accommodate more than 1,400 people have been built. This winter and spring, they will build housing for 4,000 households, as well as public buildings such as shops, hotels, and canteens, transforming Yunfeng-ri, which originally had only 150 households, into a city for construction workers. Air compressors and crawler excavators needed for the construction have been installed. The factory buildings have not yet been built, but machines such as electric saws and lathes have already started operating on the open space on the south bank of the river. Carpenters and lathe operators have begun working against the biting cold wind blowing from the river. In mid-November, ice floes were already drifting on the Yalu River, and wooden boats were carrying Korean workers to the north bank. They are building a large concrete mixing plant capable of mixing 8,000 cubic meters of concrete per day and an aggregate sorting plant on Chinese soil. They are determined to complete preparations for formal construction by April next year.

Kim Tae-ho, the chief engineer of the construction company, told reporters that the company's employees feel greatly honored to participate in the construction of the Yunfeng Power Plant together with their Chinese worker brothers. After receiving the task, they held extensive discussions and decided to mechanize more than 98% of the concrete pouring operations and use hydraulic excavation methods for the 1.96 million cubic meters of earth and rock excavation work that needs to be done before the dam is built. They designed their own machine similar to a water cannon used for hydraulic coal mining, using water from the Yalu River to excavate the soil. This can increase efficiency tenfold compared to ordinary machines. With this, the workers have a hundredfold confidence to complete the dam construction project one year ahead of schedule.

Kim Tae-ho said that the dam of this power plant, which we are building together with our Chinese brothers, will connect the lands of the two countries. The power grid of the power plant will be distributed to the lands of both countries, and the electricity generated will be exchanged like blood in the blood vessels. We will definitely work well with our Chinese brothers to complete this construction project and show the world the power of the unity of our socialist camp.

    鸭绿江畔摆阵势　要把中朝土地联
    朝鲜职工加速修建云峰发电厂
    新华社平壤22日电　本社记者报道：记者最近在访问鸭绿江上中朝合建的云峰发电厂工地时，看到朝鲜职工们为了提前一年在1961年9月完成他们分工担负的发电厂拦河大坝工程而展开了热火朝天的劳动。
    在朝鲜的云峰里附近，鸭绿江穿流过陡峭的高山，形成一个大“之”字形，朝鲜电气省第一建设公司的劳动大军就要在这个“之”字的最后一捺的地方修起一座长八百四十五公尺高一百一十二公尺的拦河大坝，以便在鸭绿江上游形成一个一百二十多公里长的人工湖，在发电厂附近造成一百一十五公尺高的落差，使鸭绿江平均每秒一千立方公尺的流水，流入在鸭绿江北岸山上开凿的山洞，带动中国方面负责建设的总发电能力为六十万瓩的六台发电机，然后再流入江中。
    朝鲜职工修建的这座大坝需要浇灌的混凝土达三百零四万立方，比著名的水丰发电厂的大坝还要多。现在担负这个艰巨的工程的朝鲜建设公司的劳动大军，已在鸭绿江两岸摆开了阵势，积极进行着正式施工前的准备工作。
    在江南岸的山脚下，可容一千四百多人的二十四幢集体宿舍已经修建起来。在今冬明春，他们要在这里建设成供四千户居住的住宅和商店、旅馆、食堂等公共建筑物，把原来只有一百五十户的云峰里变成一个建设者之城。施工所需要的空气压缩机、履带式挖土机已经安装起来。厂房还没有修起，但电锯、车床等机器已在江南岸的空地上开始转动。木工、旋工们已经迎着江上吹来的刺骨寒风开始工作。11月中旬，鸭绿江上已经在漂流着浮冰，一只只的木船把朝鲜工人送到江北岸去。他们正在中国的土地上兴建一座每天能够搅拌八千立方混凝土的大混凝土搅拌场和一座骨材拣选厂。他们决心要在明年4月完成正式施工的准备工作。
    建设公司的总工程师金泰皥对记者说，公司的职工们同中国工人兄弟们一起参加云峰发电厂的建设感到莫大的光荣。他们在接受了任务以后，展开了广泛的讨论，决心把混凝土浇灌作业98％以上机械化，把修大坝以前要进行的一百九十六万立方土石挖掘工程，采用水力挖掘法进行。他们自己设计了类似水力采煤用的水枪一样的机器，利用鸭绿江水来挖土。这样可比一般机器的效率提高十倍。这样一来，工人们有百倍的信心，提前一年完成大坝修建工程。
    金泰皥说，我们同中国兄弟们共同修建的这个发电厂的大坝将把两国的土地联挂在一起，发电厂的电力网将分布到两国的土地上，发出的电力将像血管里的血液一样互相交流。我们一定同中国兄弟们很好地完成这个建设工程，向全世界显示我们社会主义阵营团结的威力。
