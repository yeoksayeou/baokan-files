    Whips and Nooses
    Chi Beiou
    The United States recently sent the Jordanian army a large number of nylon whips. These whips hurt more than ordinary whips when used on people, but the marks left on the body are not very visible.
    The fire of resistance from the people of Jordan is everywhere,
    The small court of Hussein cannot maintain its rule.
    The lackeys are worried,
    The masters are anxious.
    Washington hurriedly sent a batch of whips,
    Newly styled, specially made of nylon,
    To severely lash those rebellious people,
    Until they kneel.
    How pleasant they think it is!
    But bad things can turn into good things,
    The Jordanian people will be spurred to be stronger,
    Recognizing that American imperialism is their mortal enemy.
    These "gifts" will eventually fall into the hands of the people,
    And they will use them to make sturdy nooses,
    To strangle the manufacturers of the whips,
    Without leaving a trace on their necks.

    鞭子和绞索
    池北偶
    美国最近送给约旦军队一大批尼龙制的鞭子，用这些鞭子打在人身上比普通鞭子要痛，而在身体上留下的伤痕则看不大出来。
    约旦人民反抗的怒火遍地，
    侯赛因小朝廷保不住他的统治。
    当奴才的担心，
    作主人的焦急。
    华盛顿赶忙送来一批鞭子，
    式样崭新，尼龙特制，
    好狠狠地抽打那些反叛的人们，
    直到他们屈膝。
    想得多么惬意呵！
    但是坏事也会变成好事，
    约旦人民将被鞭策得更坚强，
    认清美帝国主义是他们的死敌。
    这些“礼物”终会落到人民的手里，
    他们就要拿来作成结实的绞索，
    把鞭子的制造者勒死，
    而脖子上看不出一点痕迹。
