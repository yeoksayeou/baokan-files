　　“Little Telephone Soldiers” on the Front Line

　　One day in late August, on the front lines of Xiamen, after a fierce artillery battle, the line between the artillery unit's command post and a certain location was down. Before the telephone soldiers could repair it, the line suddenly came back on, with unusually clear sound.

　　It turned out that the "Little Telephone Soldiers" on the front line were repairing the wires again.

　　These "Little Telephone Soldiers" are students from the He厝 Central Primary School in the Xiamen forward area. This school organized a "Front Line Young Pioneers Support the Front" activity team of more than 100 people in the struggle against the enemy. In 1957, PLA telephone soldiers lived near their school. Team members He Danian and four others learned how to connect telephone wires from the PLA uncles. The tension created by American imperialism in the Taiwan Strait region aroused the anger of the children, and they resolved to do one thing for the PLA uncles every day. On this day, after the artillery battle began, they acted separately. He Danian's group discovered that the telephone line was broken near a certain village, and they skillfully connected the line according to the method taught by the PLA uncles. He Azhu found two places where the telephone line was broken, but without pliers, he quickly reported to the troops. In this way, in two days, they connected several broken lines and patrolled several miles of lines.

    火线上的“小电话兵”
    8月下旬的一天，厦门前线阵地上，一阵激烈的炮战过后，炮兵某部指挥所向某地通话的线路不通了。还没有等到电话兵去修理，突然，线路通了，声音异常清晰。
    原来，火线上的“小电话兵”又在接修电线了。
    这些“小电话兵”是厦门前沿河厝中心小学的学生，这个学校在对敌斗争中组织了一个一百多人的“前线少年支前活动队”，1957年，在他们的学校附近曾住过解放军的电话兵，队员何大年等五人向电话兵叔叔学到了接电线的本领。美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势激起了孩子们的心头怒火，他们决心每天为解放军叔叔做一件事。这天炮战开始后，他们分头活动，何大年这个小组在某村附近发现电话线断了，他们熟练地按着解放军叔叔教给他们的方法接好了线。何阿猪发现两处电话线断了，但没有钳子，就迅速向部队报告。就这样，在两天中，他们接了好几处断线，巡视了好几里长的线路。
