　　The Anshan Iron and Steel Works' No. 10 blast furnace has been built at an astonishing speed! What was once a patch of weeds four months ago is now a majestic blast furnace, the largest in China. This is an unprecedented speed in the history of blast furnace construction worldwide.

　　Striving for the highest speed was the constant goal of the workers building the No. 10 blast furnace. When the project started on June 15 this year, the construction site party committee bravely proposed to have the blast furnace rise from the ground in six and a half months and produce the first heat of molten iron on New Year's Day of 1959. This bold decision shocked some people at the time. They believed that the fastest speed in the world for building a large blast furnace was generally eight months, and breaking this record was impossible. Now, the facts prove that not only was eight months not used, but the scheduled six and a half months was also greatly surpassed.

　　The concrete pouring for the foundation of the No. 10 blast furnace was the first difficult project encountered by the builders, and it was also their first test in striving for high speed. At that time, the builders of the blast furnace faced two very high records: Wuhan Iron and Steel Works' No. 1 blast furnace foundation concrete was 1,790 cubic meters, poured in 27 hours; Baotou Iron and Steel Works' No. 1 blast furnace foundation concrete was 1,740 cubic meters, poured in 22 and a half hours. The foundation of the No. 10 blast furnace required pouring 3,200 cubic meters of concrete, but the builders were determined to pour it in 22 hours. This was a very difficult task. To achieve this unprecedented high speed, more than 140 cubic meters of massive concrete needed to be poured into the foundation pit every hour at lightning speed. But the workers did not flinch. They came up with various ways to improve efficiency, and finally completed the foundation project of the No. 10 blast furnace in 22 hours, creating a new record for rapid concrete construction in China.

　　During the pouring of the blast furnace and blower furnace foundations, countless moving stories emerged. Wang Zhiwei, the engineering team leader of the First Mining Construction Company, threw himself into the pouring of the hot blast furnace foundation with the workers. He was so nervous, directing the workers to repair the roads while planning the reinforcement binding, formwork support, and other preparatory work. It was late at night, and it was raining. Wang Zhiwei, who had worked hard all day, had just picked up his lunch box and sat down when he immediately remembered the scene this morning: When he just stepped out of the door, his wife, Lu Suzhen, chased after him with her big belly and said, "It's going to be these one or two days... remember to come back early tonight." His wife was about to give birth. Wang Zhiwei wanted to go home and see her so much, but when he looked back at the brightly lit construction site in the rainy night, people were engaged in a battle to seize steel from time. He decided: he couldn't leave the battlefield. His wife had enthusiastic neighbors and midwives by her side, and she could do without her husband's care, but the blast furnace could not do without him, the engineering team leader.

　　Wang Zhiwei worked with the workers for five days and nights to pour the foundation of the hot blast furnace before rushing home overnight. The house was quiet, and there was already a little baby beside his wife. The next day, when Wang Zhiwei returned to the construction site, everyone unanimously agreed to give the name "Surpassing England" to the blast furnace, after the child born on the night of the fierce battle.

　　The bricklaying of the blast furnace began. When Anshan Iron and Steel built the No. 9 blast furnace in the past, the bricklaying time was nearly 27 days. Now, the bricklaying workload of the No. 10 blast furnace is more than one-half greater than that of the No. 9 blast furnace, but the construction time is required to be greatly shortened. In order to complete the bricklaying task as soon as possible, the furnace builders quickly created a new "three-person connected trapezoidal bricklaying method," which continuously improved the bricklaying efficiency.

　　There were not enough people on the construction site, so the wives of the furnace builders automatically came to the construction site to help transport bricks. The furnace builders who built the bottom of the blast furnace and the female workers who transported bricks launched a competition. Zhang Honglin, the foreman of the bricklaying team, poked his head out of the furnace and shouted, "Comrades, you have to refuel, we are about to stop work because we are waiting for materials!" "Don't worry, we will supply as much as you lay, we are only afraid that you lack two hands." The female worker who answered him was Zhang Chunfeng.

　　Zhang Honglin and Zhang Chunfeng are husband and wife, but here they have become competitors. Encouraged by them, the bricklayers and female workers became even more energetic. On this day, the female workers had to send an average of 40 refractory bricks and enough mortar into the furnace every minute, and Zhang Honglin led his team members to complete a layer of the furnace bottom in only three hours and fifty minutes, which was more than half shorter than the original plan. In this way, the bricklaying project of the No. 10 blast furnace was completed in only sixteen and a half days, ten and a half days shorter than the No. 9 blast furnace.

　　Throughout the entire blast furnace construction period, in the one hundred and dozens of days and nights, the blast furnace builders contributed everything they had. Now, they have finally created a miracle that they never dared to think of in the past.

　　Recalling when Anshan Iron and Steel was just liberated, the Japanese once viciously said, "Now that you have blast furnaces, take them and plant sorghum!" How long ago was that? Now we have not only built Anshan into the largest steel base in China, but also built a new giant blast furnace with our own hands at the world's highest speed. Let those gentlemen who are hostile to us come and see our "sorghum"!

    世界第一流的速度

    鞍钢十号高炉以惊人速度建成了！四个多月前还是一片野草丛生的地方，今天已经巍然峙立着一座我国目前最大的高炉。这是世界高炉建设史上从未有过的惊人速度。
    力争最高速度，是建设十号高炉职工自始至终的奋斗目标。这项工程在今年6月15日开工的时候，工地党委就勇敢地提出要用六个半月的时间，使高炉平地崛起，在1959年的元旦流出第一炉铁水。这一大胆的决定，当时曾使一些人感到震惊。他们认为目前世界上建造大型高炉最快的速度一般也是八个月，打破这个纪录是不可能的事情。现在，事实证明，不仅没有用上八个月，就是六个半月的预定期也被大大地突破了。
    十号高炉基础混凝土浇灌是建设者们首先碰上的困难工程，也是他们争取高速度的第一个考验。当时，摆在高炉建设者面前有两个很高的纪录：武钢一号高炉基础混凝土一千七百九十立方公尺，二十七小时浇完；包钢一号高炉基础混凝土一千七百四十立方公尺，二十二个半小时浇完。十号高炉基础需要浇灌混凝土三千二百立方公尺，建设者们却决心用二十二个小时浇灌好它。这是一件很困难的事。要达到这个空前的高速度，每小时就需要把一百四十多立方公尺的巨量混凝土，飞快地倾倒在基础坑内。可是职工们没有退缩，他们想出了各种提高效率的办法，终于使十号高炉基础工程在二十二个小时内浇灌完毕，创造了我国混凝土快速施工的新纪录。
    在浇灌高炉和鼓风炉基础的时候，出现了不知多少动人的故事。第一矿山建筑公司工程队长王志伟与工人们一起投入了浇灌热风炉基础，他是那样地紧张，一面指挥工人抢修道路，一面计划着绑钢筋、支木模等各项准备工作。夜已深了，天下着雨，辛劳了一天的王志伟刚刚拿起饭盒坐下，立刻记起了今天早晨的情景：当他刚跨出门口，妻子陆素珍就挺着大肚子追上来对他说：“就在这一、两天了……千万记着晚上早点回来。”他的妻子就要生产了。王志伟多么想回家看看，但是当他回头望望窗外，雨夜的工地上灯火通明，人们正在进行着一场与时间争钢铁的斗争。他决定了：不能离开战场，妻子的身旁有热心的邻居和助产士，可以没有丈夫的照料，但高炉却不能没有他这个工程队长。
    王志伟同工人一起忙碌了五个昼夜浇灌完了热风炉的基础，才匆匆忙忙地连夜赶回家。家里安安静静地，在妻子身旁早已多了一个小娃娃。第二天，王志伟再回工地的时候，大家一致同意将“超英”号高炉的名字送给这个诞生在激战之夜的孩子。
    高炉砌砖工程开始了。鞍钢过去建设九号高炉时，砌砖时间是将近二十七天。现在，十号高炉砌砖工程量大于九号高炉二分之一以上，施工时间却要求大大缩短。为了尽快完成砌砖任务，筑炉工人们很快就创造了一种新的“三人连结梯形砌砖法”，使砌砖效率不断提高。
    工地人不够，筑炉工人的妻子就自动到工地上来帮助运砖。砌筑高炉炉底的筑炉工人和运砖的女工开展了竞赛。瓦工小组长张洪林从炉内探出头来喊着：“女同志要加油咯，咱们快停工待料啦！”“放心吧，你们砌多少咱们供应多少，就怕你们少长两只手。”回答他的女工是张春凤。
    张洪林与张春凤是夫妻，但在这里却变成了竞赛的对手。在他们的鼓舞下，瓦工和女工们的劲头更大了。这一天，女工们平均每一分钟就要向炉内送去四十块耐火砖和足够的灰浆，而张洪林带着他的组员们仅用三点五十分的时间就砌完了一层炉底，时间比原计划缩短了一半以上。十号高炉的砌砖工程就这样只用了十六天半，就全部完成了，比九号高炉缩短了十天半。
    在整个高炉建设期间，在一百几十个日日夜夜里，高炉建设者就是这样贡献出了他们的一切。现在，他们终于创造了过去连想都不敢想的奇迹。
    回想在鞍钢刚刚解放的时候，日本人曾经恶毒地说“现在你们有了高炉，拿去种高粱吧”！曾几何时，现在我们不但已把鞍山建设成为我国最大的钢铁基地，而且又用自己的双手以世界最高速度建成了新的巨型高炉。让那些敌视我们的先生们来看看我们的“高粱”吧！
