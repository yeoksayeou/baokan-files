    A Bite of Sweet Peach
    In the evening, I came back from rushing to make "refined grain" for the steel marshal. I picked up the October 16th People's Daily and saw the miscellany collection "Worn-out Shoes and Others" on page eight, which I thought was excellent. I spent three minutes reading seven short essays from it. Although it only occupied a corner of the newspaper, it revealed many truths and important matters. The worker comrades, having the communist ideological consciousness, said, "Piece-rate wages are like worn-out shoes, it's time to change them for a new pair." "Swinging" criticized the "conditionalism" people, and explained the role of subjective initiative. "Difficulty, Method, Experience," "Walking," and "Four Gáns" each only had two or three sentences, but fully expressed the worker comrades' spirit of not fearing difficulties, striving for advancement, and selflessly serving the collective. In short, the flower of communist thought has blossomed!
    "A humble room needs no largeness, fragrant flowers need not be many." It is hoped that newspapers in various places will abandon articles like "A Basket of Rotten Apricots" and select more "A Bite of Sweet Peach" – short, concise, and incisive articles by worker and peasant comrades!

    甜桃一口
    晚上，我给钢铁元帅赶制“细粮”回来，拿起10月16日的人民日报，看到八版上的杂感集“穿破了的鞋及其他”，觉得很好。我用了三分钟看了其中七节短文。它虽只占了一个报角，但是道破了好多真理和重大事情。工人同志们有了共产主义思想觉悟，说“计件工资好像穿破了的鞋，该换一双了”。“打秋千”批判了“条件论”者，并说明了主观能动性的作用。“困难、办法、经验”、“走路”、“四干”都只三两句话，说尽了工人同志们的不怕困难、力争上游和舍己为群的干劲。总之，共产主义思想之花开放了！
    “室雅何须大，花香不在多”。希望各地报纸对“烂杏一框”的文章要抛弃，多选“甜桃一口”——工农同志短小精悍的文章！
