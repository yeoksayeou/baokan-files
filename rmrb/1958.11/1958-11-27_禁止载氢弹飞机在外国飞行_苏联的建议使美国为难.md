Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, November 25th. The Eastern and Western conferences discussing the cessation of nuclear weapon testing and the prevention of surprise attacks are still proceeding here separately without an agenda. The reason the meetings have not been able to establish an agenda so far is that Western representatives are unwilling to reach an agreement on this matter.

The conference on preventing surprise attacks today discussed the Soviet proposal, entitled "Draft Proposal on Governments Undertaking Obligations Not to Allow Their Aircraft Carrying Atomic and Nuclear Weapons to Fly Over the Territory of Other Countries and Over the High Seas."

The Soviet proposal correctly reflects an extremely urgent desire of the people of all countries. It would save the people of all countries from the constant and deadly danger posed by American planes carrying hydrogen bombs flying over their heads, from the danger of accidents that could spread terrible death, and from the danger of war caused by American generals or American pilots who enjoy playing with fire due to misreading radar screens.

Even the Western press cannot ignore the anxieties of people in various countries about the disasters that may be caused by American aircraft carrying nuclear and atomic weapons flying over their heads. The recent crash in the United States of an American plane carrying nuclear weapons caused public panic.

Despite these facts and dangers, according to conference sources, U.S. representative Foster was still unwilling at today's meeting to stop American planes carrying hydrogen bombs from flying over other countries.

This issue is so difficult for the United States that, according to the "New York Times," the U.S. delegation requested a brief recess at the meeting to discuss the Soviet proposal with Western representatives, including discussions on "whether to try not to include the Soviet proposal in the communique."

The conference also discussed documents submitted by the West. These documents are all about the so-called "technical aspects" of surprise attacks. They have nothing to do with the causes of and preventive measures against surprise attacks.

At today's meeting discussing the cessation of nuclear weapon testing, the British delegation submitted a document on certain aspects not included in the conclusions of the expert meeting this summer. It is about a monitoring system, not about a permanent cessation of nuclear testing.

Because the West refuses to reach an agreement on the agenda, the two meetings are now proceeding under the American suggestion of having no agenda. Observers here point out that without a mutually agreed agenda, it is impossible to have any real discussion of substantive issues.

### 禁止载氢弹飞机在外国飞行  苏联的建议使美国为难

    禁止载氢弹飞机在外国飞行
    苏联的建议使美国为难
    新华社日内瓦25日电　东西方讨论停止核武器试验和停止突然袭击问题的会议仍然在没有议程的情况下在这里分别进行着。会议迄今所以没有能够制定议程，是因为西方代表不愿意在这方面达成协议。
    关于防止突然袭击问题的会议今天讨论了苏联的建议，这个建议称做“关于各国政府承担义务不让它们的载有原子武器和核武器的飞机在其它国家领土上空和公海上空飞行的建议草案”。
    苏联的建议正确地反映了各国人民的一个极为迫切的愿望。它将使各国人民免遭由于载着氢弹的美国飞机在他们上空飞行而形成的经常的和致命的危险，免遭能够散布可怕死亡的事故的危险，免遭以玩火为乐事的美国将军们或者美国的飞行员由于看错雷达的萤光屏而引起战争的危险。
    甚至于西方报纸也不能无视各国人民对于载着核武器和原子武器的美国飞机在他们上空飞行可能引起的灾难的忧虑，最近在美国发生的一架载着核武器的美国飞机的失事就引起了公众的惊慌。
    尽管有着这些事实和危险，据会议人士说，美国代表福斯特在今天的会议上仍然不想停止载着氢弹的美国飞机在其他国家上空飞行。
    这个问题对于美国是如此的难办，据“纽约时报”说，美国代表团在会议上要求短暂的休会同西方代表讨论苏联提出的建议，其中讨论了“是否应该设法不把苏联的建议列入公报”。
    会议还讨论了西方提出的文件。这些文件全都是关于突袭的所谓“技术方面”的。它们同突袭的原因和预防措施没有关系。
    在今天讨论停止核武器试验的会议上，英国代表团提出了一个关于在今年夏天专家会议的结论中没有包括的某些方面的文件。它是关于监察制度，而不是关于永久停止核试验的。
    由于西方拒绝就议程达成协议，这两个会议现在在按着美国不要议程的建议下进行。这里的观察家指出，在没有一个大家同意的议程的情况下，不可能对实质问题进行任何真正的讨论。
