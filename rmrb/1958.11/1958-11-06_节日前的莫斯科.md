    Moscow Before the Festival
    By our reporter Cui Yongchang
    Moscow on the eve of the October Revolution appears particularly solemn and beautiful. High-rise buildings in various districts are festooned with red decorations, and red flags flutter along the winding Moscow River. The portraits of Lenin hanging on various buildings are lifelike, as if looking kindly at the pedestrians on the street. The night scene on the eve of the festival is even more charming. The streets and alleys are brightly lit, and the red star of the Kremlin shines in the night sky.
    The State Department Store across from the Kremlin is very lively. Bright fluorescent lights illuminate people's joyous faces. In the food section, young female salespersons hand baskets of holiday gifts to customers. Zakharova, who is responsible for accepting orders, told reporters that they received a large number of orders on the eve of the festival, including orders for factory workers' gatherings, as well as orders from housewives who were too busy with household affairs to shop themselves. The most interesting were telegram orders. A man named Ivanov telegraphed from the Arctic exploration area, asking the department store to send 150 rubles worth of gifts to his wife and son who remained in Moscow on the eve of the festival. There are dozens of such telegrams every day.
    In order to allow citizens to have a good festival, the Moscow City Soviet Commercial Bureau has specially strengthened the supply of goods. Now Moscow sells more than 620 tons of meat, more than 430 tons of sausages, and more than 180 tons of sweets every day. Flour, macaroni, etc. can be guaranteed as much as needed. The trade volume during the festival increased by 20% to 30% compared with weekdays.
    Moscow welcomes the great festival with a new look. This year, Moscow has added more than 1.5 million square meters of new housing, which not only brings a happy life to Moscow residents, but also decorates the city more beautifully. A beautiful double-layered bridge has appeared on the Moscow River. In the two years since the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Moscow has built 69 new factories, 69 new schools, 32 new hotels, and 17 new cinemas. A subway line more than two kilometers long from Kiev Station to the suburbs will be open to traffic before the festival.
    Moscow workers are welcoming their festival with new labor. In the workshop of the "Red Proletarian" factory, a brand-new automated production line has been put into production. Here, mental labor has replaced physical labor. In order to welcome the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution, the workers of this factory not only completed the October production plan ahead of schedule, but also overproduced 225 new lathes, 20 of which were made by young workers using scrap steel they picked up. At the end of September, they also completed orders for China three months ahead of schedule. (Attached picture)

    节日前的莫斯科
    本报记者　崔永昌
    十月革命前夕的莫斯科显得格外庄严美丽。矗立各区的高楼大厦上披红结彩，蜿蜒的莫斯科河畔红旗飘扬。各处建筑物上悬挂的列宁画像栩栩如生，仿佛在慈祥地望着街上的行人。节日前夕的夜景更加迷人。大街小巷灯光辉煌，克里姆林宫的红星在夜空中射着光芒。
    克里姆林宫对门的国营大百货公司十分热闹。明亮的日光灯照耀着人们喜悦的面孔。在食品部里，年青的女售货员把一篮篮的节日礼品交给顾客。负责接受定货的扎哈洛娃告诉记者，在节日前夕他们接到了大批订货单，其中有工厂工人聚餐的订货，也有家庭主妇因为家事繁忙不能分身而提出的购货单。最有意思的是电报购货，一位名叫伊万诺夫的从北极探险区打来电报，请百货公司在节日前夕给自己留在莫斯科的爱人和儿子送去一百五十卢布的礼物。这样的电报每天总有几十封。
    为了让市民很好地过节，莫斯科市苏维埃商业局特别加强了商品供应工作，现在莫斯科每天出售六百二十多吨肉，四百三十多吨腊肠，一百八十多吨糖果。面粉、通心粉等可以保证要多少有多少。节日中的贸易额比平日增长了20％到30％。
    莫斯科以新的面貌来迎接伟大的节日。今年莫斯科又增加了一百五十多万平方公尺新住宅，这不仅给莫斯科居民带来了幸福的生活，而且把这个城市装点得更加美丽。莫斯科河上出现了一座美丽的双层桥。在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会以后两年来，莫斯科已经新建了六十九个工厂、六十九座新学校、三十二个新旅馆、十七家新电影院。一条从基辅车站通向郊区的长约两公里多的地下铁道，将在节日前通车。
    莫斯科的工人正在以新的劳动来迎接自己的节日。在“红色无产者”工厂的车间里，一套崭新的自动化工作线已经投入生产。在这里脑力劳动已经代替了体力劳动。这个工厂的工人们为了迎接十月革命四十一周年不但提前完成了10月份生产计划，并且超额生产了二百二十五台新车床，其中有二十台是青年工人用自己拾到的废钢铁制成的。在9月底他们还提前三个月完成对中国的订货。（附图片）
