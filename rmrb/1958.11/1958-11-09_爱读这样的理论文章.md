    I Love to Read Theoretical Articles Like This
    In the People's Daily on October 17th, on page seven, was an article entitled "Looking at the Relationship Between Knowledge and Practice from Wheat Abundance." This was a lecture manuscript by Comrade Li Zhe for the Agricultural University of the Ruhe Commune in Xiangcheng County, Henan, lively and suitable for the tastes of workers, peasants, and soldiers. I enjoyed reading it very much. The article clearly and specifically explained that knowledge originates from practice, and that practice is not only the source of knowledge, but also the criterion for judging truth.
    The entire article is just over a thousand words, but it explains this theoretical issue very clearly. I sincerely hope that theoretical workers will write more such popular and easy-to-understand articles, and that newspapers and periodicals will also pay attention to selecting and publishing them, in order to meet the theoretical requirements of us workers, peasants, soldiers, and students.

    爱读这样的理论文章
    人民日报10月17日第七版上刊载了一篇题为“从小麦丰产看认识和实践的关系”的文章。这是李哲同志给河南襄城县汝河社农业大学讲哲学的一篇讲稿，生动活泼，适合工农兵的口味，我很喜欢读。文章鲜明具体地阐明了认识来源于实践，实践不仅是认识的来源，而且是判断真理的标准。
    全篇文章不过一千多字，把这个理论问题，说得很清楚。我竭诚地希望理论工作者们，多写些这样的通俗易懂的文章，报刊也注意选登，以适应我们工农兵学理论的要求。
