Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 20th - Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government Prime Minister Ferenc Münnich, on the results of the recent National Assembly and local council elections, said: The fact that the Hungarian people voted for the candidates of the Patriotic People's Front proves that the Hungarian people agree with and support the policies of the Socialist Workers' Party and the government.

"People's Free Press" published Münnich's remarks on the 20th.

Münnich said: "The leadership of the country has won the trust of the people. The people voted for the consolidation of the people's power and socialism. This election is the first general election after the counter-revolutionary events, and therefore it has special political significance."

Münnich also pointed out that the victory of the election dealt a powerful blow to the enemies of the Hungarian people. If the United Nations, under the pressure of the United States, raises the so-called "Hungarian question" again today, it will only discredit itself further. The vast majority of the people voted to trust the government. On what basis can the Hungarian government be accused of being illegitimate?

Münnich finally emphasized: "After the Hungarian counter-revolutionary events, Hungary achieved national unity. The decisive victory won by the Patriotic People's Front, led by the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party in the election, signifies a serious defeat for the forces of imperialism."

    明尼赫总理谈匈大选结果
    匈人民投了社会主义的票
    帝国主义和反动派遭到沉重打击
    新华社布达佩斯20日电　匈牙利工农革命政府总理明尼赫就此次国民议会和地方会议的选举结果，发表谈话说：匈牙利人民投了爱国人民阵线候选人的票证明，匈牙利人民赞同并支持社会主义工人党和政府的政策。
    “人民自由报”20日刊登了明尼赫的谈话。
    明尼赫说：“国家的领导获得了人民的信任，人民投了巩固人民政权和社会主义的票，这次选举是反革命事件后第一次大选，因此它有着特别的政治意义。”
    明尼赫还指出，选举的胜利给了匈牙利人民的敌人以有力的打击。今天如果联合国再在美国的压力下提出所谓“匈牙利问题”，那么这只能使它更加威信扫地。绝大多数人民都投了信任政府的票，有什么根据指控匈牙利政府是不合法的呢？
    明尼赫最后强调说：“在匈牙利反革命事件后，匈牙利实现了全民族的团结，匈牙利社会主义工人党所领导的爱国人民阵线在选举中获得的决定性胜利，意味着帝国主义力量的严重失败。”
