    Welcoming Marshal Kim Il-sung
    Tian Han

    In 1951, during the first visit to Korea for慰问 (comforting/expressing sympathy), I visited Premier Kim Il-sung with Comrade Liao Chengzhi in a small village in Pyongyang at night. I recently heard that the General is visiting Beijing, and I am delighted to compose three poems in the律诗(Lüshi) style.

    One
    Through wind and rain, China and Korea are inseparable,
    In a remote village on a cold night, we called on the General.
    The fire of war scorched the sky, red as blood,
    Annihilating the enemy with heroic fervor, abundant as clouds.
    The Yalu flows leisurely, carrying friendship,
    Mount Kumgang stands tall, recording extraordinary achievements.
    Taiwan again reports extending its demonic claws,
    Acheson's stubbornness will only lead to his own destruction.

    Two
    Fresh blood congeals into flowers of friendship,
    Eight years of living together, as close as family.
    Across thousands of miles of frozen land, we carried the wounded and sick,
    Amidst the constant artillery fire, we delivered food and tea.
    Young girls came at night to fill embroidered pillows,
    Kind old men today tidy his black gauze hat.
    How can we bear to part, even singing the farewell song?
    Ten thousand tears, like a tide, wet the battle vehicle.

    Three
    Last month, I made a trip to Xiamen,
    Waves surged and roared with ten thousand cannons.
    We will not allow the west wind to blow across the Asian continent,
    We will certainly teach the Star-Spangled Banner to sway in Penghu.
    The will of the Party can move mountains and overturn seas,
    The comradely sentiments of battle, with disheveled hair and helmet cords.
    If the General calls upon me one day,
    Do not forget this militiaman on the mainland.

    迎金日成元帅
    田汉
    一九五一年第一届赴朝慰问，曾与廖承志同志等夜访金日成首相于平壤一小村。顷闻将军来访问北京，喜成三律。
    一
    风雨中朝不可分，
    孤村寒夜谒将军。
    烧天战火红如血，
    歼敌豪情盛似云。
    鸭绿悠悠流友谊，
    金刚屹屹纪殊勋。
    台湾又报伸魔爪，
    艾杜冥顽只自焚。
    二
    鲜血凝成友谊花，
    八年相处已如家。
    冰封千里抬伤病，
    炮火连天送饭茶。
    少女宵来填绣枕，
    怜翁今日整乌纱。
    骊歌纵唱何能别？
    万泪如潮湿战车。
    三
    月来曾作厦门行，
    浪涌波翻万炮鸣。
    不许西风吹亚陆，
    定教星帜舞台澎。
    移山倒海党人志，
    披发缨冠战友情。
    他日将军如号唤，
    莫忘大陆一民兵。
