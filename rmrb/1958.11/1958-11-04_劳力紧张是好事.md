    Labor Shortage is a Good Thing
    By our reporters Feng Jianwei and Yan Jilie
    Wangjiazhuang in Pingyao is located on the Jinzhong Plain, with vast land and a chronic shortage of labor. This year, due to the unprecedented bumper harvest of autumn crops, harvesting, transporting, and threshing are particularly labor-intensive. The winter wheat planting area is not only twice as large as last year, but also requires deeper plowing, finer sowing, and more fertilizer. Therefore, since the end of August, the villagers have been extremely busy with autumn harvesting and wheat planting. However, during this tense period, young and middle-aged laborers were transferred out like flowing water. The first batch of four hundred, selected from the best, went to support steel production. The second batch of eighty was added, each also excellent. The third and fourth batches went to support wheat planting in neighboring villages, and strong women and older men also followed. Needless to say, the leading cadres of the commune and teams also had to lead the teams to the front. Calculated in this way, out of more than 840 male and female full and half laborers in the village, two-thirds were transferred out, leaving less than 200 people, each not even worth half a worker. This situation was very worrying, and many commune members and cadres believed that the "Three Autumns" (autumn harvesting, plowing, and sowing) work would definitely not be completed. Even Deputy Director Liu Jinzao, Zhi Chunnian, and Deputy Secretary Hou Guiying did not know what to do for a while!

    However, Liu Jinzao and Zhi Chunnian did not remain confused in the face of difficulties for long. They quickly found the correct path – relying on the masses, tapping into labor potential, and resolutely completing the autumn harvest and autumn planting tasks. They decided to find solutions where there were contradictions, using the labor shortage as a driving force to promote work. Therefore, in the dining hall and in the fields, they repeatedly publicized the labor shortage to the commune members and launched debates: Should we support steel production? Should we support wheat planting in neighboring villages? What should we do about the labor shortage? They also told the commune members that the labor shortage was a good thing because production was developing rapidly. This year, after hard work, the average yield per mu was more than 2,000 jin, and the grain ration per person increased from 340 jin last year to 500 jin. Everyone can eat their fill. With another year of hard work next year, we can harvest more wheat and eat well. After three years of hard work, we can eat well, dress well, live well, and build the country well. Sure enough, the commune members understood these principles, and their enthusiasm for labor quickly increased. Everyone worked day and night. Except for eight hours for eating and sleeping, all the time was spent on labor, without distinguishing between night and day, sometimes working all night long. Even when cadres urged the commune members to rest, they were reluctant to go home. The village's rubber-wheeled carts and human-powered flat carts went up the mountains with the steel army. When there were not enough transport vehicles, the commune members automatically used bicycles to deliver manure and crops, and the transportation efficiency increased fourfold. Originally, it was planned to harvest 100 mu of autumn crops per day, but actually more than 300 mu were harvested, and the speed of wheat planting was also much faster.

    Following the idea of finding solutions wherever there were contradictions, Liu Jinzao and Zhi Chunnian, after a large number of laborers were transferred out, mobilized the commune members to do a good job of supporting the steel front. Before National Day, Zhi Chunnian was sent to the Pudong mountainous area, hundreds of miles away, to慰问 (express sympathy and solicitude to) the steel army, carrying moon cakes, vermicelli, pork, and liquor. During the visit, it was found that there was a shortage of tools for carrying ore, shoes were wearing out quickly, and tents were not warm enough. After returning to the village, they immediately raised sacks, reed mats, oilcloth, as well as barbering and shoe-nailing tools. The commune members also cared that life on the front line was hard and decided to send all 1,600 jin of rice supplied from other places to the front line. This greatly stimulated the fighting spirit of the steel army. They swore to fight hard on the construction site, and by the end of the month, they were elected as a model company, and sent the good news to the rear. When the villagers received the merit report, everyone smiled and said: "People are suffering so much outside, and they still strive for a model title. We live well at home. If we don't work hard, we will be sorry for our relatives on the front line." The front line and the rear, the steel army and the autumn harvesting and wheat planting army, were as united as the army and civilians during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, caring for and encouraging each other, which played an inestimable role in tapping into labor potential and improving labor productivity.

    What Liu Jinzao and Zhi Chunnian thought of, they led the masses to accomplish. What they did not think of, the commune members took the initiative to supplement. The people who were transferred to support steel production did not bring cotton clothes, and immediately eleven women in the village sewed and mended clothes and socks for them overnight. More than 30 households who went out as a whole family were initially worried that pigs, sheep, chickens, and rabbits would starve to death after they left, and they were uneasy. The unified fighting will quickly increased the communist style of "one for all, all for one." People who did not usually interact came to help when the steel army set off. This one took away a sheep, that one drove away two pigs, and Wang Runlian, the mother of five children, undertook to feed eleven pigs from her neighbors alone, and even her young children went out to pull grass and dig vegetables to ensure that the rabbits had enough to eat.

    The characteristics of Liu Jinzao and Zhi Chunnian's leadership in autumn harvesting and wheat planting were not only to seize the labor shortage situation and mobilize the masses ideologically, but also to take very effective organizational measures step by step with the development of this tense situation. When a large number of laborers were transferred out and the number of middle-level leaders was reduced, and the original fourteen production teams were in a scattered state, they immediately adopted militarization and combatization. The entire village was organized into three companies and a battalion command. The company commanders and battalion commanders went to the companies every day and carried out shock labor with the commune members, only meeting at noon and dinner time to study and arrange work. After the labor organization was rectified, some companies found that the discipline and arrangements were chaotic, so they seized the time to make labor plans and skillfully arranged and used labor. The village had more than 3,500 mu of autumn fields, with thirteen kinds of crops maturing at different times, and more than 2,300 mu of wheat had a tight planting time. The village also had sideline businesses, vegetable gardens, and supply and marketing, credit, health care, and other departments that needed people to work in. Liu Jinzao and Zhi Chunnian decided to first focus on wheat planting and autumn harvesting. The supply and marketing cooperative was asked to bring goods to the fields, the cooks delivered food to the fields, and the health center, accountants, and work recorders worked in the fields. The labor force of the three companies in the village was also divided into four echelons. The first batch of strong laborers rushed to harvest the autumn crops to free up the land, the second batch specialized in delivering fertilizer, the third batch with technology cultivated and sowed, and the fourth batch of weaker laborers threshed, harvested cotton, and picked beans. Some companies divided the work more meticulously and rationally, with strong laborers working in distant fields, weak laborers and women working in nearby fields, blind and lame people rocking windmills and cutting grain ears on the threshing ground, and five-year-old children picking cotton with their mothers. All the people who went to the fields took bags with them when they went and carried corn on their backs when they returned. The autumn crops in front of and behind the houses did not require any carts or horses for transportation, and were all taken care of by the people who went to the fields to work.

    After more than a month of intense labor, Wangjiazhuang not only completed the autumn harvest and wheat planting quickly and well, and gained experience in highly tapping into labor potential, but more importantly, educated the cadres and commune members. The people of the whole village have developed a selfless spirit of cooperation. Whenever the country's steel production or neighboring villages needed it, they enthusiastically participated, and came at a call. Everyone took pride in helping others, and had a high degree of awareness and organizational discipline in cooperation. After this exercise, the whole village has become a new socialist countryside where every household has no idle people and everyone loves labor. The village's customs and habits have undergone profound changes.

    Liu Jinzao and Zhi Chunnian have also been greatly improved in this tense battle. Recently, a visiting delegation from other provinces asked them what leadership experience they had. Liu Jinzao said with a smile: "In the past, we were afraid of difficulties and avoided contradictions in our work. As a result, the more we were afraid of difficulties, the more they increased, and the more we avoided contradictions, the more they followed us, and we could not complete the work tasks. Now, leading the autumn harvest and wheat planting, we have reversed the situation, turning to actively looking for difficulties and contradictions, and finding solutions from difficulties and contradictions. As a result, the difficulties have been overcome, the contradictions have been resolved, and the work tasks have been completed." Zhi Chunnian also cited many facts to prove Liu Jinzao's point of view. He said: "We were very worried when the first batch of laborers was transferred out, but we were not worried when the second batch was transferred out, because we found a trick. Every time a batch leaves, we can dig out a batch of potential, and it will never end!"

    劳力紧张是好事
    本报记者　冯建伟　阎继烈
    平遥王家庄在晋中平原，土地宽广，从来就缺乏劳力。今年，由于秋作物空前大丰收，收割运打都特别费工，冬小麦播种面积不仅要比去年扩大两倍，而且要耕的深，播的细，多施肥；因此，从8月末开始秋收种麦，村里人就忙的不行。可是，正在这紧张时节，青壮年劳动力像流水样哗哗地向外调，头一批支援钢铁走了四百，是从好的里头挑的。第二批又补充八十，也是个顶个的好。第三批、第四批支援邻村种麦，壮年妇女和有岁数的男人，也跟着走了；社和队的领导骨干，不用说也得带队出征。这样计算下来，全村八百四十多个男女全半劳力，前后走了三分之二，留下不满二百人，一个不顶半个使唤。这种情况，很使人发愁，许多社员和干部都认为三秋工作肯定完不成了，连副主任刘锦藻、支春年和副支书侯桂英一时也不知该怎么办才好！
    可是，刘锦藻和支春年并没有在困难面前迷糊多久，他们很快找到了正确的道路——依靠群众，发挥劳动潜力，坚决完成秋收秋种任务。他们决定哪里有矛盾向哪里找办法，利用劳力紧张的形势作推动工作的动力。于是，他们在饭堂和田间，反复向社员宣传劳力紧张的状况，发动社员鸣放辩论：该不该支援钢铁生产？该不该支援邻村种麦？劳力紧张怎么办？他们还告诉社员，劳动力紧张是因为生产发展的快，是好事。今年紧张苦战，全村平均亩产两千多斤，每人口粮由去年三百四十斤增加到五百斤，大家可以放开肚子吃饱饭。明年苦战一年，多收小麦，就能吃好；苦战三年就能吃好、穿好、住好，还能把国家建设好。果然，社员们理解了这些道理，劳动干劲很快提高了。大家不分昼夜地干，每天除吃饭睡觉用八小时外，全是劳动时间，根本不分黑夜白日，有时直干通宵。干部劝说社员休息，还迟迟不肯回家。村里的胶轮大车、人拉平车都随着钢铁大军上山走了，运输车辆不够用，社员们自动用脚踏车送粪、送庄稼，运输效率一下提高四倍，原来计划每天收秋一百亩，实际收三百多亩，种麦速度也快了很多。
    按着哪里有矛盾向哪里找解决办法的想法，刘锦藻和支春年在劳动大军外调以后，就发动社员作好支援钢铁战线的工作。国庆节前夕，还派支春年携带月饼、粉条、猪肉、烧酒，远涉百里到普洞山区慰问钢铁大军。慰问时，发现那里缺少扛矿石的器具，鞋子破的快，帐篷也不够温暖。回村后，立即筹集麻袋、苇席、油布，还有理发和钉鞋工具；社员们还体贴前线生活苦，决定把外地供应的一千六百多斤大米，一齐送到前线。这一来，大大激发了钢铁大军们的斗志。他们在工地上宣誓奋战，到月底就当选模范连，并且把喜报送到后方。村里人接到立功喜报时，个个喜笑颜开，纷纷说：人家在外边那么苦，还争得个模范称号，我们在家生活好，不好好干，对不起前方的亲人。前线和后方，钢铁大军和秋收种麦大军，就像抗日战争和解放战争时期军民那样团结，互相关怀，互相鼓励，对于发挥劳动潜在力，提高劳动生产率，起了无可估量的作用。
    刘锦藻和支春年想到的，都领导群众作到了。没有想到的，社员们主动补上了。外调支援钢铁生产的人们没有带棉衣，村里马上有十一个妇女，连夜给他们缝补衣袜。有三十多户全家外出的人，他们开始很担心走了以后，猪、羊、鸡、兔会饿死，心情不安。统一的战斗意志，使人们很快地增长了“我为人人，人人为我”的共产主义风格，平常不相往来的人，在钢铁大军出发时，也跑来帮忙。这个拉走一只羊，那个赶走两口猪，五个孩子的妈妈王润莲，一个人就承担喂养邻家的十一口猪，连她的小孩子也出外拔草、挖菜，保证小兔不缺吃的。
    刘锦藻和支春年领导秋收种麦的特点，不仅是抓住劳力紧张形势，从思想上发动群众，还随着这种紧张形势的发展，一步一步的采取了很有效的组织措施。当大批劳力外调，中层领导骨干减少，原来的十四个生产队处于散乱状态时，马上就搞军事化、战斗化。全村组成三个连，一个营指挥部。连长、营长每天到连队，和社员一起进行突击劳动，只是每天中午和晚饭时候，才碰头研究安排工作。劳动组织整顿就绪以后，少数连队发现纪律和安排较乱现象，又抓紧作劳动规划，巧妙安排和使用劳力。全村三千五百多亩秋田，有十三种作物成熟期参差不齐，两千三百多亩小麦播种时间很紧，村里还有副业、菜园和供销、信贷、保健等部门工作，样样都要有人干。刘锦藻和支春年决定，首先抓种麦和秋收。要供销社带货上地，炊事员送饭到田，保健院、会计员、计工员到地办公。全村三个连的劳力，也分为四个梯队。第一批强壮的突击秋收腾地，第二批专门送肥，第三批有技术的耕作播种，第四批较弱的打场、收摘棉花和豆角。有的连队分工更细致合理，强劳力到远地干活，弱劳力和妇女在近地干活，瞎子拐子在打谷场上摇风车、剪谷穗，五岁小孩跟妈妈摘棉花。所有上地的人，去时拿口袋，回时背玉米，家前屋后的秋作物，根本没有派一车一马运输，都是上地干活的人捎带就办了。
    经过一个多月的紧张劳动，王家庄不仅又快又好地完成秋收种麦工作，取得了高度发挥劳动潜在力的经验，更重要的是教育了干部和社员群众。全村人民都养成一种大公无私的协作精神。凡是国家钢铁生产，或是邻村需要的，他们都踊跃参加，一唤就到，人人都以帮助别人为荣，而且在协作中有高度的自觉性和组织纪律性。经过这次锻炼，全村变成了户户无闲人，个人爱劳动的新农村，村里的风尚和习俗面貌，都发生了深刻的变化。
    刘锦藻和支春年在这场紧张战斗中，也得到很大的提高。最近，外省参观团问到他们有什么领导体会。刘锦藻笑着说：“以前我们作工作怕困难，躲矛盾，结果，困难越怕越多，矛盾越躲越跟上走，工作任务也完不成。现今领导秋收种麦，打了个颠倒，变成主动找困难，找矛盾，从困难和矛盾中找解决办法，结果，困难克服了，矛盾解决了，工作任务完成了。”支春年也列举了很多事实证明刘锦藻的论点。他说：“我们在头一批外调劳动力时，很发愁，第二批外调时，就不发愁了，因为我们找到一个窍门，走一批我们能挖出一批潜在力，永远没个完！”
