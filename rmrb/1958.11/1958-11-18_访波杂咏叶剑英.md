    Miscellaneous Poems Written During a Visit to Poland
    Ye Jianying

    Remembering Chopin in Warsaw Park (Bodhisattva Barbarian)
    Golden autumn colors are good in Warsaw, Chopin composed in old Paris,
    Wind and willows sweep the setting sun, scratching my head thinking of home.
    In spring, flowers compete to bloom, posthumous works people compete to play,
    Don't lament few kindred spirits, Boya regretted breaking his zither.

    On the Vistula River Bridge in Warsaw
    Bullet marks and shell gaps are unforgettable, Warsaw was reborn from the bitter battlefield,
    Now gazing on the banks of the Vistula, red buildings and green grass adorn the fair city.

    To Krakow City
    Krakow was built as an ancient capital, the church trumpet still calls,
    The Polish people listen once each noon, the Tartars shot me back then.

    En Route to Katowice
    Vast wilderness, green and flat, seventeen acres given to each farmer,
    Hearing that solar energy is lacking, even now food and clothing still need to be imported.

    Visiting the Auschwitz Concentration Camp
    Four hundred and fifty thousand poisoned corpses, Himmler was truly a wild and savage beast.
    Auschwitz has been turned into a lesson, teaching people to unite, teaching people to be strong.

    Girls in Opole Offer Flowers
    So many green leaves, so much good fortune, one red flower, a piece of heart.
    Hearing the children offering flower blessings, it stirs poetic inspiration into delicate chanting.

    Farewell Poland
    Golden autumn colors woven into a picture, brocade mountains and rivers taken in at a glance.
    What makes people most nostalgic, is the friendship that is twice as fresh upon departure.

    访波杂咏
    叶剑英
    华沙公园怀萧邦（菩萨蛮）金黄秋色华沙好，肖邦作曲巴黎老，
    风柳扫残阳，搔头念故乡。
    春来花竞秀，遗曲人争奏，
    莫叹少知音，伯牙悔碎琴。
    在华沙维斯拉河桥上
    弹痕炮隙对难忘，华沙重苏苦战场，
    今到维斯拉畔望，楼红草绿靘时妆。
    到克拉可夫城
    克拉可夫建古都，教堂喇叭至今呼，
    波人一午一听省，鞑靼当年射杀吾。
    赴卡多维兹道中
    茫茫原野绿平芜，十七华亩授一夫，
    闻道太阳能量少，至今衣食尚将输。
    参观奥斯维辛集中营
    毒尸四百五十万，希姆莱真野兽狂。
    奥斯维辛翻作教，教人团结教人强。
    奥波莱女孩们献花
    几多绿叶几多福，一朵红花一片心。
    听得儿娃献花祝，引人诗兴入微吟。
    别波兰
    金黄秋色缀成图，锦绣山河一览收。
    最足使人留念处，临行友谊倍来初。
