    World's First "Underwater Laboratory"
    Soviet Scientific Submarine to Set Sail Next Month
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 25th: According to TASS, the world's first underwater laboratory, a Soviet-built submarine capable of conducting comprehensive scientific investigations in the deep ocean, is nearing completion and will begin its first scientific research voyage in December.
    This submarine has many observation windows, some of which are equipped with oceanographic photography equipment, film and television equipment. Because the ship is equipped with powerful lights, deep-sea exploration can also be carried out at night. In addition, this underwater laboratory also carries various new instruments, which will study a series of questions in fisheries and oceanography that cannot yet be answered definitively. Its work has great economic significance.

    世界第一个“水下实验室”
    苏联科学潜艇下月远征
    新华社25日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科消息：世界上第一个水下实验室、苏联建造的可在海洋深处从事综合科学考察的潜水艇即将全部建成，并在12月份开始第一次科学研究的远洋航行。
    这艘潜水艇上有许多了望窗，在一些窗口上装有海洋摄影器械，电影及电视等设备。由于船上装有强力的照明灯，所以夜间也可以进行海洋深处的考察工作。此外，这个水下实验室还带有各种新式的仪器，它将研究一系列在渔业、海洋学方面至今还不能确切回答的问题。它的工作具有巨大经济意义。
