Before the revolution, Russia had only a few handicraft-style factories producing soda, chemical fertilizers, and dyes, with raw materials mainly imported from abroad. There was no chemical industry to speak of. The Soviet chemical industry is a newly built industrial sector after the revolution, and its output value has already leaped to second place in the world.

The Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan stipulates that the chemical industry should be accelerated in order to reach the world's top position in a short period. By 1965, the total output value of the chemical industry should increase by three times compared to 1958.

    Rich Chemical Industrial Raw Materials

The Soviet Union's oil and natural gas reserves rank first in the world. These two substances are the most valuable raw materials for the chemical industry. It is estimated that one ton of oil can refine 400 kilograms of synthetic substances. In addition, for every ton of oil extracted from the ground, 50 cubic meters of gas can be obtained at the same time. Calculated in this way, the Soviet Union's oil-producing areas can provide more than 9 billion cubic meters of gas in 1958 alone. If these gases are not burned off in vain and are all used as raw materials for manufacturing synthetic substances, then these raw materials will be three times more than the total output of the United Kingdom and West Germany, and half more than the output of the United States last year.

    Inexpensive and High-Quality Daily Necessities

The plan stipulates that the production of chemical fibers should increase by 2.8 to 3 times in seven years, of which synthetic fibers should increase by 11 to 13 times, and plastics and synthetic resins should increase by 5.7 times. The rapid development of the above-mentioned industrial sectors will greatly increase the production of inexpensive and high-quality daily necessities, which will promote the realization of the following tasks proposed in the Seven-Year Plan: "By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the total output of textiles, clothing, and footwear in the Soviet Union and the average output per capita will approach the level of the United States."

The production of chemical fertilizers also occupies an important position in the development of the chemical industry. The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that by 1965, the output of chemical fertilizers should be expanded three times. This will play a significant role in improving the yield per unit area of agriculture.

    Building a Large Number of Chemical Plants

In order to complete such a huge production task, the plan stipulates that chemical industrial enterprises should be vigorously built. More than 140 new and more than 130 renovated large-scale chemical industrial enterprises will be built in seven years, with a total investment of more than 100 billion rubles. The new large-scale chemical plants are mainly built in areas rich in oil and natural gas, paying special attention to the construction in the eastern and Central Asian republics. After seven years, the chemical industry will become one of the leading sectors of the national economy in these regions. In the Bashkir Autonomous Republic, which is rich in oil, billions of rubles will be allocated to develop the chemical industry in seven years. It is estimated that in seven or eight years, the chemical industrial production of this autonomous republic alone will exceed the level of the United Kingdom in 1957.

In the Volga River Basin, where oil production is abundant and cheap electricity is available, many chemical industrial enterprises have also begun construction. In the city of Stavropol, not far from the world's largest Kuibyshev Hydropower Station, a very large synthetic rubber factory is being built, and the entire complex production process of this factory will be automated.

### 化学工业就要跃居世界第一

    化学工业就要跃居世界第一
    在革命前的俄国，只有少数半手工业式的制造苏打、化学肥料和染料的工厂，原料也主要是靠从外国进口，根本谈不上什么化学工业。苏联的化学工业是革命后新建起来的工业部门，它的产值已跃居世界第二位。
    苏联的七年计划规定，化学工业要加速发展，以便在短期内登上世界首位。到1965年，化学工业总产值要比1958年增加两倍。丰富的化学工业原料
    苏联的石油和天然气的储藏量，都占世界第一位。而这两种物质正是化学工业最可贵的原料。据计算，一吨石油就可以提炼四百公斤人造物质。此外，从地下开采一吨石油，同时可以获得五十立方公尺气体，这样计算起来，仅在1958年一年，苏联的石油产地就可以提供九十多亿立方公尺气体。如果这些气体不被白白烧掉，全部用来做为制造合成物质的原料，那么这些原料比英国和西德的总产量要多三倍，比美国去年的产量多半倍。
    价廉物美的日用品
    计划规定，七年内化学纤维的生产要增加二点八倍至三倍，其中合成纤维要增加十一倍至十三倍，塑料和合成树脂增加五点七倍。上述工业部门这种飞跃的发展，将大大增加价廉物美的日用品的产量，这将促进七年计划所提出的下述任务的实现：“在七年计划结束时，苏联的纺织品、衣服和鞋类的总产量和按人口平均的产量，将接近美国的水平。”
    化学肥料的生产也在化学工业发展中占有重要的地位。七年计划规定，到1965年，化肥的产量要扩大到三倍。这对提高农业的单位面积产量，将起不小的作用。
    兴建大批化学工厂
    为了完成这样巨大的生产任务，计划规定要大力兴建化学工业企业。七年中要新建一百四十多项、改建一百三十多项巨大的化学工业企业，总投资额达到一千亿卢布以上。新的大型的化工厂主要建在盛产石油和天然气的地区，特别注意在东部和中亚各共和国兴建，七年后要使化学工业成为这些地区国民经济的主导部门之一。仅在盛产石油的巴什基尔自治共和国，在七年之间即要拨出几十亿卢布来发展化学工业，预计在七、八年后，单是这一个自治共和国的化学工业生产就将超过英国1957年的水平。
    在伏尔加河流域这个石油产量丰富又有廉价电力供应的地方，许多化学工业企业也已开始动工兴建。在距世界上最大的古比雪夫水电站不远的斯塔韦罗波里市，正在建设一个非常巨大的合成橡胶工厂，这个工厂的全部复杂的生产过程都将是自动化的。（附图片）
