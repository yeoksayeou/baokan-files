Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 13th. The Great Leap Forward has fundamentally changed the face of the Yunnan border region. At the recent First Session of the Second Yunnan Provincial People's Congress, the heads of various autonomous prefectures excitedly spoke about the changes in their prefectures.

    Dao Jingban, the head of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, said: "In Tengchong County of our prefecture, there is a new folk song that goes like this: 'Ancestors labored for thousands of years, each person had only two fen of land; now laboring for dozens of days surpasses ancestors' thousands of years.' In fact, this is the case for our entire prefecture. This year, the prefecture's total grain output has more than doubled compared to last year, with an average of 1,500 jin of grain per person. Last winter and this spring, the prefecture successively constructed irrigation projects covering more than 1.6 million mu, equivalent to the total irrigation area of the entire prefecture before liberation. Now we have 2,622 factories and mines, and the total annual industrial output value can reach more than 300 million yuan, an increase of twelve times compared to 1957. Just two years ago, most people in the autonomous prefecture had rarely even heard the words 'industry' or 'factory.' A few years ago, you could walk through several villages in a row and not find a single literate person, but now, when you walk through those villages again, you might not find a single illiterate young or middle-aged person. After a year of effort, we have eliminated illiteracy among all young and middle-aged people in the prefecture, popularized primary school education, and today, most townships have established agricultural middle schools and agricultural technical schools, and the autonomous prefecture has established agricultural colleges, medical colleges, and teachers' colleges. In our area, which was historically a world-renowned hyper-endemic malaria zone, today there are not only very few malaria patients, but even rats, sparrows, mosquitoes, flies, fleas, lice, and bedbugs are hard to find. We are nationally famous for eliminating the seven pests."

    Dao Jingban is not only proud of the achievements of the Great Leap Forward in the motherland's border region but also full of confidence in the future border region construction. For more than a month, he has been busy participating in the Border Region Socialist Planning Conference held in Kunming. (Attached photo)

    祖宗劳动几千年每人只有二分田  现在劳动几十天胜过祖宗几千年
    刀京版谈德宏傣族景颇族自治州的变化
    新华社昆明13日电　大跃进已使云南边疆的面貌根本改观，在最近召开的云南省第二届人民代表大会第一次会议上，边疆各自治州州长兴奋地讲述了他们州的变化。
    德宏傣族景颇族自治州州长刀京版说：我们州腾冲县有一首新民歌是这样唱的：“祖宗劳动几千年，每人只有二分田，现在劳动几十天，胜过祖宗几千年。”其实我们全州也是这样，今年全州粮食产量比去年翻一番多，粮食平均每人已达一千五百斤。去冬今春，全州先后兴修了灌溉一百六十多万亩的水利工程，等于解放前全州灌溉面积的总和。现在我们已有厂矿二千六百二十二个，全年工业产值可达三亿多元，比1957年增加十二倍。仅仅在两年以前，自治州里绝大部分人甚至连“工业”“工厂”这些字眼，都还很少听见过。几年前，你可能连续走过几个村子，找不到一个识字的人，但是现在，你再走过那些村子时，可能找不到一个不识字的青壮年了。我们经过一年的努力，就在全州扫除了全部青壮年文盲，普及了小学教育，今天，大部分乡开办了农业中学、农业技术学校，自治州开办了农学院、医学院和师范学院。我们那里，历史上是全世界有名的超高度疟疾区，但是，今天不但很少有疟疾病人，就是连老鼠、麻雀、蚊子、苍蝇、跳蚤、虱子、臭虫也很难找到了。我们在除七害方面，是全国有名的。
    刀京版不仅对祖国边疆大跃进的成绩感到骄傲，而且对未来的边疆建设充满信心。一个多月来，他一直忙着参加在昆明举行的边疆社会主义规划会议。（附图片）
