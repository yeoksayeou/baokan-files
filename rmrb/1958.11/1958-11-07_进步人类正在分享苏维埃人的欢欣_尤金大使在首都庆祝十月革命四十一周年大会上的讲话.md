Comrade Chairman, Dear Comrades and Friends:

The people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union are celebrating the 41st anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution with immense excitement and inspiration. The people of all nationalities of the People's Republic of China, the working people of all socialist countries, and all progressive mankind are sharing the joy of the Soviets.

Forty-one years ago, the Communist Party, headed by the great Lenin, mobilized millions of workers, peasants, and all laborers in our country to undertake the great construction of a new world. It ignited their hearts with the fire of creative enthusiasm, pointed out clear goals for them, and instilled in them a deep belief in their own powerful creativity and the victorious future of communism. The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the construction of socialism in the Soviet Union are the glorious triumphs of Marxism-Leninism.

The construction of a socialist society is a contribution of world-historical significance by the Soviet people. A new path for the development of human history has thus been opened up. Now, countries in Europe and Asia with a population of 900 million are following this path. However, socialism is only the initial stage of a new social system—communism.

In the Soviet Union, the productive forces of socialist society have reached such a level that socialism has begun to gradually transform into communism. In our country, communism is no longer a distant future; its vivid outlines can be clearly seen today in the creative labor of workers, peasants, and intellectuals. In every factory, collective farm, and state farm, in schools and scientific research institutions—everywhere the Soviet people labor—they are fighting for communism.

During the years of Soviet power, not only have material living conditions fundamentally changed, but also a new moral and spiritual outlook of the Soviet people has been created. The Communist Party has cultivated new people—ardent patriots of the socialist motherland; for them, the primary thing in life is labor. The Soviet people know that it is precisely their creative energy, their labor, that is bringing us closer to the sacred goal of communism. Comrade Khrushchev said: "The labor that creates all material and cultural wealth, the labor that ennobles people and beautifies our land, the labor that makes our country increasingly prosperous—this labor has already begun to become the most essential life need for millions of Soviet people, a source of their true human happiness."

In terms of economic development, our country has already surpassed some developed countries such as Britain, West Germany, and France in the absolute production level of pig iron, steel, coal, electricity, cement, cotton cloth, and certain other industrial products. For certain important industrial and agricultural products, such as the production of woolen fabrics, the production of animal fats, and the harvest of wheat, sugar beets, and potatoes, the Soviet Union has already surpassed the level of the United States. In recent years, the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States not only in the speed of growth but also in the annual absolute increase in many kinds of products, especially iron ore, pig iron, steel, oil, coal, and cement.

The Soviet Union is building industrial sectors based on atomic technology. The world's first atomic power station has been working since 1954. This year, the first 100,000 kilowatt part of the world's largest atomic power station with a generating capacity of 600,000 kilowatts has been put into production. The construction of the "Lenin" atomic icebreaker is nearing completion, and the production of intercontinental ballistic rockets has been successfully organized.

The Soviet people are greeting the great festival with new achievements in all aspects of peaceful construction. What our country has accomplished and is accomplishing is a convincing proof of the superiority of the socialist system. The great Lenin foresaw that the socialist revolution would open the way for an unprecedentedly rapid development of productive forces, and this has been realized and become a fact. Here are some figures:

Comparing 1957 with 1913, the total industrial output of the United States increased 4.1 times, Britain—1.8 times, France—2 times, and the Soviet Union—33 times. During the same period, the output of machinery manufacturing and metal processing industries in the United States increased 17 times, Britain—5.1 times, France—2.6 times, and the Soviet Union—more than 200 times; the steel output of the United States increased 3.2 times, Britain—2.8 times, France—2 times, and the Soviet Union—12.1 times, and so on.

Before the 1917 revolution, Russia had no automobile industry of its own. Now, the Soviet Union's automobile industry produces almost 500,000 vehicles a year—one vehicle per minute.

In pre-revolutionary agriculture, mechanical power was less than 1%. In 1958, almost all laborious farm work—plowing, sowing of grain and technical crops, and harvesting of grain—was completely mechanized. In 1958, the state has received more commodity grain than the record harvest of 1956, and almost twice as much as in 1953. The achievements in Soviet agriculture in recent years can boldly be called historically significant. In this regard, the reclamation of virgin and fallow lands played a huge role. In the reclamation of virgin lands, the Soviet people demonstrated mass heroism. Reclaiming 36 million hectares of virgin land in three years could only be done by a people who not only possessed powerful technology but also had absolute confidence in their cause and were full of revolutionary determination and strong will.

In pre-revolutionary Russia, 76% of the population was illiterate (from the age of nine), and 88% of women were illiterate. Now our country has universally implemented seven-year universal education and is extensively implementing secondary and higher education. In the 1957-58 academic year, more than 50 million people in the Soviet Union participated in various types of study. One out of every four people is studying.

In August 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world's first ultra-long-range intercontinental ballistic missile. Using this rocket, any region on earth could be reached without relying on aviation equipment. The Soviet Union's third artificial Earth satellite, launched on May 15, 1958, weighed approximately the same as a large truck (1,327 kilograms), and the scientific instruments it carried alone weighed about one ton. It has been orbiting the earth for almost six months, and the whole world is amazed by this crystallization of human wisdom. The Soviet Union is preparing for flights to other planets.

The Communist Party and the Soviet government are extremely concerned about improving the material welfare of the working people. The materials on the per capita production of products are the most eloquent proof of this. From 1913 to 1957, the total industrial output per capita increased 23 times. The Soviet people are successfully solving the task of completely solving the housing problem in the next ten to twelve years. As early as 1957, the average number of homes built in the Soviet Union was 10.6 per 1,000 residents, while the United States was 6.7 and Britain was 5.9.

The resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU will outline grand and moving prospects. The control figures for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union in 1959-65, which will be studied by the Congress, will be a concrete program for communist construction, a new and great leap forward in the development of socialist society and its gradual transition to communism.

The Soviet Union has formulated an overall plan for the development of the national economy and culture in the next fifteen years. Our country is entering a period of large-scale communist construction. The main task of this period is to comprehensively establish the material and technical basis of communist society. This will be a decisive stage in the competition with the capitalist world. During this period, the historical task of catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product output should be practically solved.

The fifteen-year plan stipulates that, as stated at the 40th Anniversary Commemoration of the October Revolution, the output of all decisive industrial sectors in the Soviet Union will be increased two to three times during this period. The mining of iron ore will be increased three to five times, oil—four times, gas thirteen to fifteen times, pig iron and steel—2.3 times, electricity—4.3 times, and so on. The seven-year plan for 1959-1965 is the basic part of the fifteen-year plan, and the majority of the fifteen-year plan program will be completed during these seven years.

Speaking of our achievements, we are naturally proud of our Soviet people. However, there is neither boasting nor arrogance here. We know that the people of other countries are also creating great miracles in the development of industry, science, and culture. We just want to emphasize the indisputable fact that our country, in a very short historical period, has completed a revolutionary leap from backwardness to progress and has become one of the advanced countries in the world.

How can we not rejoice that our country has 765 institutions of higher learning, 3,500 secondary technical schools, and other secondary specialized schools, in which 4.5 million people are studying. There are 7.5 million experts with higher and secondary specialized education working in the national economy, which is almost 40 times more than before the revolution. The Soviet Union graduates three times as many engineers from its higher education institutions each year as the United States.

How can we not be proud that the Soviet Union has 270,000 scientific workers, a whole army of scientific workers, for whom all conditions for creative work have been created. Soviet scholars have made great contributions to all sectors of world science, and have achieved outstanding achievements, especially in mathematics, physics, mechanics, chemistry, electronics, automation technology, biology and other disciplines. These scientific achievements have enabled a series of important problems in the national economy to be successfully resolved. Our era is the era of the victory of the ideas of the October Revolution, the era of the victory of the ideas of Marxism-Leninism. The great Chinese people and the working people of a series of countries in Europe and Asia are advancing along the road opened up by the October Revolution. The experience of the Chinese revolution, as well as the experience of all countries in the world socialist camp in the struggle for socialism, once again confirms the great Lenin's words: "We are on the right track, because sooner or later other countries are bound to take this road." (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian edition, Volume 33, page 136).

The Chinese Communist Party and its Central Committee, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, guided by the theory of Marxism-Leninism, are confidently leading the great Chinese people along the road of building socialism in China. The Chinese Communist Party creatively applies the experience of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in building socialism, develops this experience forward, starts from the national characteristics of its own country, and adopts new forms and methods of building socialism, thereby making a huge contribution to the development of Marxism-Leninism on the theory and practice of building socialism. Lenin was precisely aware of this when, in his article "On Our Revolution" in 1923, he said: "Our European philistines never even dreamed that in the countries of the East, with a much larger population and infinitely more special social conditions, the future revolution would undoubtedly show them even more special circumstances than the Russian revolution." (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian edition, Volume 33, page 439).

The Soviet people are watching with great joy the amazing achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction. The achievements China has made in the development of industry, agriculture, and culture during the years of people's power show that the People's Republic of China has surpassed most countries in Asia by an entire historical era in terms of political, economic, and cultural development, which, like China, were also in a colonial and semi-colonial position in the past.

This once again proves that only the socialist revolution can liberate all the creativity of the people and guarantee unprecedented development of social productive forces.

On this joyous festival, the Soviet people extend fraternal greetings to the great friends and brothers—the Chinese people—and wish them new and outstanding achievements in their creative labor of building socialism.

There is an unbreakable bond of fraternal friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples. This friendship is solid and unbreakable because it is illuminated by the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism and the unity of purpose and aspirations of our two peoples. The stronger our friendship, the more secure the cause of peace and progress, and the closer the bright future of all mankind—communism. The Soviet people and the Chinese people have been and will always be marching forward shoulder to shoulder, like faithful friends.

The historic meeting between Comrade Khrushchev and Comrade Mao Zedong in August of this year was a great contribution to consolidating our friendship. The whole world has once again seen that Soviet-Chinese friendship is a strong fortress against war.

The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries firmly defend world peace. The timely and stern warnings from our countries, supported by peace-loving people all over the world, shattered the aggressive attempts of the United States and Britain in the Near East and Middle East this summer.

Now the United States is carrying out armed provocations in the coastal area of ​​China's Taiwan region. The Chinese people liberating their own territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands since ancient times is China's internal affair, and no one has the right to interfere. The Soviet people believe that the Chinese people will solve their internal problems themselves, the Chinese people's just cause will surely triumph, and Taiwan and the coastal islands will be reunited with other parts of China. If the American imperialists interfere in this purely internal Chinese issue and impose war on the Chinese people, then, as Comrade Khrushchev has declared, the Soviet people will regard the aggression against China and all its consequences as an aggression against the Soviet Union. In this case, our country, faithful to its alliance obligations, will do everything possible to defend the security of the two countries together with the Chinese people, and defend the interests of peace in the Far East and the world.

Facts show that the enemies of socialism are always trying to divert the strength of the socialist camp countries from peaceful development, creating conflicts and tensions from time to time, and threatening war. The imperialists' policy of "positions of strength" or "brinkmanship" pursues the arrogant goal of eliminating socialism or at least hindering the victorious development of socialism. At the same time, this policy also seeks to stifle the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and restore colonialism. But the illusions of our enemies are just pitiful pipe dreams. The balance of power on the world stage has changed forever and irrevocably in favor of peace and socialism. It is impossible to reverse history. The achievements of socialist countries in economy, technology, and science have also enhanced their military and political power. Let our enemies not forget this. Socialist countries, supported by all peace-loving countries and people, will never allow imperialist powers to recklessly plunge the world into the abyss of a new world war.

Today, the People's Republic of China is a powerful, independent, and peace-loving country. Its role in the cause of consolidating peace and friendship among all peoples is immense. Without the participation of the People's Republic of China, it is impossible to solve major international issues worldwide, especially in Asia. The People's Republic of China has a huge positive impact on the development of Asian and African countries and on the upsurge of the national liberation movement in colonial and semi-colonial countries. It is an outstanding example of what Asian peoples who have embarked on the road of independent development can achieve.

The People's Republic of China has great significance in enhancing the strength of the socialist camp, strengthening the solidarity and unity of the socialist camp countries, and fighting against the enemies of socialism—all kinds of revisionists.

The People's Republic of China's peace-loving foreign policy is winning more and more friends to its side and isolating its enemies.

On the 41st anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet people congratulate the Chinese people on achieving even greater achievements in realizing their peace-loving foreign policy and in the struggle for peace and human progress.

Long live Marxism-Leninism—the victorious banner of the Great October Socialist Revolution!

Long live the 41st anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution!

Long live the unbreakable friendship and cooperation between the Soviet and Chinese peoples—a powerful factor for world peace!

    进步人类正在分享苏维埃人的欢欣
    尤金大使在首都庆祝十月革命四十一周年大会上的讲话主席同志：亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    苏联各族人民正以极其兴奋鼓舞的心情庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十一周年。中华人民共和国各族人民、所有社会主义国家的劳动人民和全体进步人类正在分享苏维埃人的欢欣。
    四十一年前，以伟大列宁为首的共产党，在我们国家发动了千百万的工农群众和所有劳动者进行新世界的伟大建设。它以创造热忱之火点燃了他们的心，向他们指出了明确的目标，树立他们对自己的强大创造力和共产主义未来胜利的深厚信念。伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利和社会主义在苏联的建成是马克思列宁主义的光辉凯旋。
    社会主义社会的建成是苏联人民的具有全世界历史意义的功勋。人类历史发展的新道路从而开辟出来了。现在有九亿人口的欧洲、亚洲各个国家走着这条道路。但是，社会主义只是新的社会制度——共产主义的初级阶段。
    在苏联，社会主义社会的生产力已经达到这样的水平，社会主义已经开始逐步地转变为共产主义。在我国，共产主义已经不是遥远的未来；它的活生生的轮廓，今天在工人、农民、知识分子的创造劳动中，可以明显地看到。在每一个工厂、集体农庄和国营农场，在学校和科学研究机关——在苏维埃人劳动的每一个地方，都在为共产主义而斗争。
    在苏维埃政权年代中，不但物质生活条件已经根本改变，而且创造了苏维埃人的新的道德面貌和精神面貌。共产党培养了新的人——社会主义祖国的热烈的爱国者；对于他们，生活中首要的东西是劳动。苏维埃人知道，正是他们的创造的精力、他们的劳动，使我们正在接近共产主义的神圣目标。赫鲁晓夫同志说过：“创造一切物质和文化财富的劳动，使人高尚和美化我们的大地的劳动，使我们国家愈来愈富强的劳动——这种劳动已经开始成为千百万苏维埃人的最紧要的生活必需，成为他们真正的人的幸福的源泉。”
    我们国家在经济发展上，已经在生铁、钢、煤、电力、水泥、棉布及其他某些种工业产品的绝对生产水平方面，超过了像英国、西德、法国这样一些发达的国家。某些种重要的工农业产品，如毛织品的生产，动物油脂的生产，小麦、甜菜和马铃薯的收获，苏联则已经超过美国的水平。在最近几年，苏联不但在增长的速度，而且在许多种产品的每年绝对增长额方面，超过了美国，特别是铁矿砂、生铁、钢、石油、煤和水泥。
    苏联在建设着以原子技术为基础的工业部门。从1954年起世界上第一座原子能发电站开始工作，今年，拥有发电能力六十万瓩的世界上最大的原子能发电站的第一部分十万瓩已投入生产，“列宁”号原子破冰船的建造正在完成，洲际弹道火箭的生产已成功地组织起来。
    苏联人民以和平建设所有方面的新成就迎接伟大的节日。我们国家已经完成的和正在进行的事业，是社会主义制度优越性的令人信服的证明。伟大列宁预见，社会主义革命将为生产力的空前迅速发展开辟道路，已经实现，成为事实，这里是一些数字：
    1957年同1913年比较，美国的工业总产量增加为四点一倍，英国——一点八倍，法国——二倍，苏联——三十三倍。同期间，美国的机器制造和金属加工业产量增加为十七倍，英国——五点一倍，法国——二点六倍，苏联——二百倍以上；美国钢产量增加为三点二倍，英国——二点八倍，法国——二倍，苏联——十二点一倍等等。
    1917年革命以前，俄国没有自己的汽车工业。现在，苏联的汽车工业一年生产几乎五十万辆汽车——每分钟一辆汽车。
    在革命前的农业中，机械动力不到1％。而在1958年，所有的费力的农活——耕地、谷物和技术作物的播种、谷物的收割，几乎全部机械化了。1958年，国家已经收到了比创纪录丰收的1956年还要多的商品粮食，和1953年比较，则几乎多一倍。苏联农业近几年获得的成就，可以大胆地称为具有历史意义的成就。在这方面，开垦生荒地和熟荒地起了巨大的作用。在开垦荒地中，苏维埃人表现出群众性的英雄主义。三年中间开垦三千六百万公顷荒地，这只有不但拥有强大的技术，而且对自己事业有绝对信心、充满革命坚毅和坚强意志的人民，才能做得到。
    在革命前的俄国有76％的居民是文盲（从九岁算起），而妇女则有88％是文盲。现在我国已普遍实行七年制普及教育，并且在广泛实行中等和高等教育。在1957—58这一学年内苏联共有五千万人以上参加各种类型的学习。每四个人当中就有一个人在学习。
    1957年8月，苏联发射了世界上第一支超远程的洲际弹道火箭。利用这种火箭，可以不依靠航空设备，达到地球上任何地区。1958年5月15日发射的苏联第三个人造地球卫星，其重量约等于一辆大的载重汽车（一千三百二十七公斤），单是上面带的科学仪器就约有一吨重，现在它围绕地球飞行快六个月了，全世界都为这一人类智慧的结晶而惊讶。苏联正在准备到其他星球上去的飞行。
    共产党和苏维埃政府极为关怀劳动人民物质福利的提高。关于这一点，按人口平均计算的产品生产的材料，是最雄辩的证明。从1913年到1957年，整个工业总产量，按人口平均计算，增长为二十三倍。苏联人民正在顺利地解决已提出的最近十——十二年内完全解决住宅问题的任务。早在1957年，苏联建筑的住宅，平均每一千居民，就合十点六套，而美国为六点七套，英国为五点九套。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会的决议将规划出伟大的动人的前景。代表大会将研究的苏联在1959—65年的国民经济发展控制数字，将是共产主义建设的具体纲领，是社会主义社会及其逐步向共产主义过渡的发展中的新的巨大的跃进。
    苏联已经制订了最近十五年内国民经济和文化发展的总计划。我们国家正在进入大搞共产主义建设的时期。这一时期的主要任务就是全面地建立共产主义社会的物质技术基础。这将是与资本主义世界竞赛的一个决定性的阶段，在这个时期内，应当实际解决这样一个历史性的任务，即在按人口平均计算的产品产量上，赶上和超过世界上最发达的资本主义国家。
    十五年计划规定，如十月革命四十周年纪念大会上所说的，在这一时期内，苏联各决定性的工业部门的产量将提高到二至三倍。铁矿砂的开采量要提高到三——五倍，石油——四倍，瓦斯十三——十五倍，生铁和钢——二点三倍，电力——四点三倍等等。1959——1965年的七年计划是十五年计划的基本部分，在这七年中间将要完成十五年计划纲领的大部分。
    讲到自己的成就，我们自然为我们苏联人民而自豪。但是，在这里，既无自夸，也无自大。我们知道，其他国家的人民也在发展工业、科学和文化方面创造着伟大的奇迹。我们只是想强调指出这个无可争辩的事实，即我们国家，在很短的历史时间内，完成了由落后到进步的革命飞跃，变成了世界上先进国家之一。
    我们怎样能不欢欣，就是我们国家有七百六十五所高等学校，三千五百所中等技术学校和其他的中等专业学校，在这些学校里学习的有四百五十万人。在国民经济中劳动的有七百五十万受过高等教育和中等专业教育的专家，这比革命以前几乎多到四十倍。苏联高等学校每年毕业的工程师，为美国的三倍。
    我们怎样能不自豪，就是苏联有二十七万科学工作者，这是整整一支科学劳动者的大军，为他们创设了创造性工作的全部条件。苏联学者们对于世界科学的所有部门都作出了巨大的贡献，特别在数学、物理学、力学、化学、电子学、自动技术、生物学和其他学科方面达到了卓越的成就。这些科学成就使得国民经济的一系列重要问题得到了顺利的解决。我们的时代是十月革命的思想胜利的时代，是马克思列宁主义思想胜利的时代。伟大的中国人民和欧洲、亚洲一系列国家的劳动人民，正在沿着十月革命开辟的道路前进。中国革命的经验，以及世界社会主义阵营所有各国为社会主义而斗争的经验，再一次地证实了伟大列宁的话：“我们所走的路是正确的路，因为其他各国早晚也必然会走这一条路的”。（列宁全集俄文版第三十三卷一百三十六面）
    中国共产党和它的以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会，以马克思列宁主义学说为指南，正在满怀信心地领导着伟大的中国人民沿着在中国建设社会主义的道路前进。中国共产党创造性地运用苏联和其他社会主义国家建设社会主义的经验，向前发展这种经验，从自己国家的民族特点出发，采用建设社会主义的新的形式和方法，从而对发展马克思列宁主义关于建设社会主义的理论和实践，作出巨大的贡献。列宁正是注意到这一点，1923年他在“论我们的革命”这篇文章中说：“我们的欧洲庸人们连做梦也没有梦想到，在东方的那些人口更多得无比，社会条件更特殊到万分的国家里，今后的革命，无疑是会向他们表现出比俄国革命更为特殊的情况来的。”（列宁全集俄文版第三十三卷，四百三十九面）。
    苏联人民以极大的喜悦注视着中国人民在社会主义建设中的惊人成就。中国在人民政权的年代中在发展工业、农业及文化方面所获得的成就，表明中华人民共和国在政治、经济和文化发展方面已经超过亚洲大部分国家整整一个历史时代，这些国家和中国一样，过去也是处于殖民地和半殖民地的地位。
    这再一次证实了，只有社会主义革命能够解放人民的所有的创造力，能够保证社会生产力获得空前未有的发展。
    在这个使我们欢乐的节日里，苏联人民向伟大的朋友和兄弟——中国人民致以兄弟般的敬礼，并祝他们在建设社会主义的创造性的劳动中获得新的卓越的成就。
    苏联人民和中国人民之间，有着牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊的联系。这种友谊之所以坚固和牢不可破，是因为它是由马克思列宁主义的伟大思想和我们两国人民的目标与意愿的一致所照耀着的。我们的友谊愈坚固，和平与进步的事业就愈有保障，全人类的光辉灿烂的未来——共产主义就愈接近。苏联人民和中国人民过去是而且将来永远是一道并肩前进，就像忠实的朋友一样。
    赫鲁晓夫同志和毛泽东同志今年8月的具有历史意义的会谈，对于巩固我们的友谊，是巨大的贡献。全世界又一次看到了，苏中友谊是制止战争的强大的堡垒。
    苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家坚定不移地保卫着世界和平。我们各国的及时的严厉警告，受到全世界爱好和平人民的拥护，粉碎了今年夏天美国和英国在近东和中东的侵略企图。
    现在美国正在中国台湾地区的沿海进行武装挑衅。中国人民解放自己自古以来就有的领土——台湾和沿海岛屿是中国的内政，任何人都没有权利干涉。苏联人民相信，中国人民自己将解决自己的内部问题，中国人民的正义事业一定会胜利，台湾和沿海岛屿必将和中国的其他部分重新统一起来。如果美帝国主义者干涉这个纯粹是中国内部的问题，并且把战争强加到中国人民头上，那末，正如赫鲁晓夫同志所宣布的，苏联人民将把对于中国的侵犯，以及因此而产生的一切后果，看作是对苏联的侵犯。在这种情况下，忠实于自己同盟义务的我国，将尽一切可能和中国人民一起保卫两国的安全，保卫远东和全世界和平的利益。
    事实表明，社会主义的敌人总是竭力想把社会主义阵营国家的力量从和平发展方面引开，时而在这里，时而在那里制造冲突和紧张局势，进行战争威胁。帝国主义者的“实力地位”或“战争边缘”政策追求着一个狂妄的目的，就是消灭社会主义或者最少阻止社会主义的胜利发展。同时，这个政策还竭力想扼杀亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的民族解放运动，恢复殖民主义。但是我们的敌人的幻想只是可怜的空想而已。世界舞台上力量的对比已经永远地、不可挽回地改变，而有利于和平与社会主义了。要想向后扭转历史是不可能的。社会主义国家在经济、技术、科学方面的成就同时也增强了他们在军事政治方面的威力。让我们的敌人不要忘记这一点。为一切爱好和平的国家和人民所支持的社会主义国家，决不允许帝国主义列强为所欲为地把世界投入新的世界战争的深渊。
    今天的中华人民共和国是一个强大的、独立的和爱好和平的国家。它在巩固和平与各族人民间的友谊的事业中所起的作用是巨大的。没有中华人民共和国的参加，就不可能解决全世界的，特别是亚洲的重大的国际问题。中华人民共和国对于亚洲和非洲国家的发展，对于殖民地和半殖民地民族解放运动的高涨起着巨大的积极的影响，它是一个卓越的榜样，说明走上了独立发展道路的亚洲各国人民，能够达到怎样的成就。
    中华人民共和国在增强社会主义阵营的实力，加强社会主义阵营各国的团结一致，以及反对社会主义的敌人——形形色色的修正主义者的斗争中，有巨大的意义。
    中华人民共和国的爱好和平的外交政策争取着愈来愈多的朋友站在它的方面，孤立着它的敌人。
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命四十一周年纪念日，苏联人民祝贺中国人民在实现自己的爱好和平的外交政策和为和平与人类进步事业而斗争中，获得更加巨大的成就。
    马克思列宁主义——伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利旗帜万岁！
    伟大的十月社会主义革命四十一周年万岁！
    苏联人民和中国人民的牢不可破的友谊与合作——世界和平的强大因素万岁！
