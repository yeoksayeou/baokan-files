Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th: Under the slogan of "Not Leaving an Ounce of Iron by the Furnace," the people of Henan Province are vigorously launching a massive campaign to concentrate on the external transfer of steel and iron. According to statistics for the first half of November, the province externally transferred more than 56,000 tons of indigenous steel and pig iron, including more than 22,000 tons to Shanghai, more than 10,000 tons to Beijing, and more than 14,000 tons to the First Ministry of Machine Building. In addition, more than 45,000 tons of indigenous steel and pig iron have been concentrated along railways and highways and are awaiting shipment. All of these steel and iron have been selected and inspected by personnel from the ordering units and meet quality standards.

Since the beginning of November, various parts of Henan Province, in accordance with the provincial Party committee's instructions on the external transfer of steel and iron, have vigorously mobilized the masses to carry out transportation work. In organizing transportation in Xinxiang Special District, widespread debates were held on "Why should pig iron be transferred externally?", "What are the benefits of externally transferring pig iron to the country and to ourselves?", and "How to transfer pig iron externally?", which enhanced the understanding of cadres and the masses. Everyone regarded supporting steelmaking as a glorious task. In order to ensure the rapid completion of the external transfer task, transportation offices have been established in various places, and the First Secretary personally took charge. In the external transfer, many regions also particularly emphasized that the amount of steel and iron transferred externally is one of the criteria for measuring and checking the situation of steel production.

In recent days, while producing, concentrating, and transporting, various parts of Henan Province have organized hundreds of thousands of people into a transportation army, working hard day and night, concentrating from all directions to highways and railways, with a busy transportation scene everywhere.

Nanning, 20th: The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is massively mining and transporting manganese ore to support key steel bases such as Anshan, Baotou, Chongqing, and Shijingshan. As of November 5th, more than 11,000 tons of manganese ore have been shipped to the above-mentioned areas from the Fenghuang Mining Area alone, and more than 30,000 tons are in transit.

Guangxi has abundant reserves of manganese ore, ranking first in the country. Moreover, the quality of manganese ore is high, and the hard manganese ore necessary for steelmaking generally has a content of more than 40%. Guangxi manganese ore has always been supplied for export and to various steel bases in the country.

Shanghai, 20th: The people of Shanghai, who are working hard for steel, have been greatly encouraged by the continuous support of pig iron from fraternal regions. They are using practical actions of producing more steel, refining good steel, and manufacturing more machines to respond to the enthusiastic support of the people in fraternal regions.

Since November, the amount of pig iron transferred to Shanghai from the six provinces of East China and Hunan, Henan, Guangxi, and other provinces and autonomous regions has increased rapidly, while ensuring the needs of key steel production bases. Within seventeen days, more than 157,000 tons of pig iron have been shipped to Shanghai from various places, an increase of 80% compared with the same period in October, which has improved the tight supply of raw materials for Shanghai's steelmaking industry.

With the strong support of pig iron from various places, Shanghai's steel production is rising. In the first ten days of this month, the average daily steel production was about 7,000 tons, and since the middle of the month, it has stabilized at a level of about 8,000 tons per day. In the past, due to the very tight supply of pig iron, sometimes the pig iron from other places was put into production before it could be tested. Now, with the increase in the amount of support from various places, factories can test and batch pig iron, so the quality of steel has also improved.

Large batches of newly refined qualified steel ingots are continuously sent to the steel rolling mill to roll various small and medium-sized steel products needed in other places. The Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant used pig iron supported by various places to refine good steel and cast steel rolls for rolling mills on the 300 mm to 600 mm rolling mill for the Anhui Steel Plant. Many factories are also rushing to manufacture complete sets of blast furnaces, converters, and rolling equipment for steel plants in Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other places using the steel refined by the steel plant.

Due to the continuous increase in steel production, Shanghai still feels that the supply of pig iron is insufficient. According to the plan to produce 1.2 million tons of steel this year, Shanghai will produce more than 10,000 tons of steel per day in the future, and the demand for pig iron will increase. The relevant departments are asking various places for greater support in terms of the quantity and quality of pig iron.

Fuzhou, 20th: The people of Shanghai are promoting a high degree of communist cooperation and supporting Fujian's industrial construction with a large number of machines and equipment. Since the beginning of this year, more than 900 tons of steel, complete sets of steel smelting equipment, procurement and transportation equipment, giant generator sets, motors, and machine tools have been shipped from Shanghai to Fujian. Batches of machines and equipment are also on the way.

Hundreds of factories in Shanghai are working day and night to rush to manufacture various smelting equipment for steel plants in Sanming, Longyan, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other places in Fujian. Most of the complete sets of iron-making blast furnaces, steel-making converters, rolling mills, and other auxiliary equipment required for the Sanming Iron and Steel United Enterprise with an annual output of 600,000 tons of steel are manufactured and supplied by Shanghai. The construction of several large power stations in Fujian has also received generous and selfless assistance from Shanghai. The survey and design of the nationally renowned Minjiang Hydropower Station and the four major hydropower stations of Jianxi, Gutian, and Tingjiang are all the responsibility of Shanghai. The large-scale construction machinery and electromechanical equipment required for these four power stations will also be manufactured and supplied by many factories such as the Shanghai Construction Machinery Manufacturing Plant and the Shanghai Turbine Plant in batches over the next two years. Other coal industry, machinery industry, sugar industry, and textile industry have also received strong support and assistance from Shanghai in terms of materials and equipment.

    互助协作下好全国一盘棋
    河南广西赶运生铁矿石支援钢铁基地
    上海工人炼好钢造机器回答各地盛意
    据新华社郑州20日电　河南省人民在“炉旁寸铁不留”的口号下，正在雷厉风行地掀起一个千军万马突击外调钢、铁的热潮。据11月上半月统计，全省共外调土钢和生铁五万六千多吨，其中调给上海二万二千多吨，北京一万多吨，第一机械工业部一万四千多吨。另外还有四万五千多吨土钢和生铁已经集中到铁路和公路沿线，正待启运。这些钢、铁都是经过订货单位人员选择验收，质量全部合格。
    从11月初开始，河南省各地根据省委突击外调钢、铁的指示，即大力发动群众开展调运工作。新乡专区在组织调运中，普遍进行了“为什么要外调生铁？”、“外调生铁对国家对自己有什么好处？”和
  “怎样外调生铁”的大辩论，提高了干部和群众的认识，人人把支援炼钢当成光荣的任务。为了保证外调任务的迅速完成，各地都成立了调运办公室，并且由第一书记亲自挂帅。在突击外调中，许多地区还特别强调：外调钢铁的多少，是衡量检查钢铁生产情况的标准之一。
    近几天来，河南省各地在边生产、边集中、边运输的情况下，组织了数十万人的运铁大军，风餐野宿，披星戴月，从四面八方向公路、铁路沿线集中，到处出现了车水马龙的紧张运输景象。
    本报南宁20日电　广西僮族自治区正大量开采和调运锰矿石支援鞍山、包头、重庆、石景山等钢铁重点基地，到11月5日止，仅从凤凰矿区运往上列各地的锰矿已有一万一千多吨，还有三万多吨在启运中。
    广西锰矿蕴藏量丰富，占全国第一位，而且锰矿质量高，炼钢必需的硬锰矿一般含量在40％以上。广西锰矿一直供应出口和国内各地钢铁基地。
    本报上海20日电　辛勤为钢而战的上海人民，受到兄弟地区源源支援生铁的巨大鼓舞。他们正在用多炼钢、炼好钢和制造更多机器的实际行动来回答兄弟地区人民的热情支援。
    11月份以来，华东六省和湖南、河南、广西等省、自治区在保证重点钢铁生产基地需要的前提下，调给上海生铁的数量迅速增加。十七天内，从各地运到上海的生铁已有十五万七千多吨，比10月份的同期增加80％，使上海炼钢工业的原料供应紧张情况有了好转。
    得到各地生铁的大力支援以后，上海的钢产量正在上升。本月上旬平均每天产钢七千吨左右，中旬以来每天已稳定在八千吨左右的水平。过去由于生铁供应十分紧张，有时甚至外地生铁一到来不及化验便投入生产，现在各地支援数量增加，工厂有可能对生铁逐批进行化验、配料，钢的质量因此也有所提高。
    大批新炼出的合格的钢锭源源送进轧钢厂，轧制外地需要的各种中小型的钢材。上钢三厂用各地支援的生铁，炼出好钢，为安徽钢厂浇出了三百米厘到六百米厘轧钢机上的轧辊钢铸件。许多工厂也正在用钢厂炼出的钢为福州、厦门等地的钢铁厂赶制成套的高炉、转炉和轧钢设备。
    由于钢产量的不断增加，上海目前的生铁供应仍然感到不足。根据今年产钢一百二十万吨的计划，今后上海每天将产钢一万吨以上，需要的生铁越来越多。有关部门正要求各地在生铁的数量和质量上作更大的支援。
    本报福州20日电　上海人民发扬高度的共产主义协作精神，以大批机器设备支援福建工业建设。今年以来，由上海运来福建的有九百多吨钢材、成套的钢铁冶炼设备、采购运输设备、巨型的发电机组、电动机和机床等大批的机器设备。还有成批的机器设备正在运来途中。
    上海几百个工厂正在日夜为福建三明、龙岩、福州、厦门等钢铁厂赶制各种冶炼设备。年产六十万吨钢的三明钢铁联合企业所需的成套炼铁高炉、炼钢转炉、轧钢机以及其他附属设备等，大部分都是上海制造供应的。福建几个大型电站的建设也得到了上海慷慨无私的援助，全国闻名的闽江水电站以及建溪、古田、汀江四个大水电站的勘测设计，全部是由上海负责的。这四个电站所需的大型施工机械以及机电设备，也大部分由上海建筑机械制造厂、上海汽轮机厂等许多工厂在明后两年分批制造供应。其他煤炭工业、机械工业、制糖工业、纺织工业也得到了上海在材料、设备上的大力支援和协助。
