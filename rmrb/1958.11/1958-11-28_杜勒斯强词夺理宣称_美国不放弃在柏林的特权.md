Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 27th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles discussed the Berlin issue at a press conference on the 26th. Many reporters asked him what the U.S. government would do about the Berlin problem. Dulles stated that the United States would not relinquish any "rights" it enjoyed in Berlin. To defend the United States' position of deliberately obstructing the normalization of the situation in Berlin, Dulles insisted that the Soviet Union also had no right to transfer its obligations in Berlin to the German Democratic Republic.

A reporter asked what the Western countries would do if the Soviet Union transferred its obligations in Berlin to the German Democratic Republic. Dulles replied that, in that case, the Western countries might have to deal directly with the German Democratic Republic. He said: "Now, in some respects, the Western countries, namely the three allies and the Federal Republic of Germany, are dealing with minor officials of the so-called German Democratic Republic." "You cannot rule this out to a lesser extent, because this is happening at the moment and has happened in the past."

Dulles also said, "There have been de facto dealings, especially in the economic field and in the transportation between West Berlin and the Federal Republic of Germany," and this exchange "has reached a considerable level."

In order to justify the U.S. government's awkward position of being unwilling to diplomatically recognize the German Democratic Republic, yet being forced to deal with it, Dulles said that the United States would treat the German Democratic Republic as a "proxy" of the Soviet Union and would not agree to allow the "East German regime to replace the Soviet Union in fulfilling Soviet obligations and responsibilities."

Dulles strenuously emphasized that his remarks on what the Western countries would do on the Berlin issue were "unanimously agreed" upon by the West, that there was a "basic agreement" among the Western countries, and that "nothing would happen that would cause division." However, according to reports, Bonn immediately expressed "surprise" at Dulles's remarks after Dulles held his press conference. A West German government spokesman emphasized on the evening of the 26th that there was no "agreement" in the West regarding the attitude towards the German Democratic Republic, and Bonn would oppose Dulles's views.

### 杜勒斯强词夺理宣称  美国不放弃在柏林的特权

    杜勒斯强词夺理宣称
    美国不放弃在柏林的特权
    新华社27日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯26日在记者招待会上谈柏林问题。许多记者问他，美国政府在柏林问题上将采取什么做法。杜勒斯表示，美国将不放弃它在柏林享有的任何“权利”。为了替美国这个蓄意阻挠柏林恢复正常局面的立场辩护，杜勒斯硬说苏联也没有权利把自己在柏林的义务移交给德意志民主共和国。
    有记者问，如果苏联把它在柏林的义务移交给民主德国，西方国家将怎么办。杜勒斯回答说，在那种情况下，西方国家有可能要同德意志民主共和国直接打交道。他说：“现在在一些方面，西方国家即三个盟国以及德意志联邦共和国都正在同所谓德意志民主共和国的次要官员打交道。”“你不能在较小的程度上排斥这一点，因为这一点目前正在进行，过去也进行过。”
    杜勒斯还说，“事实上的打交道是有过的，特别是在经济方面以及柏林西部和德意志联邦共和国之间的往来运输方面”，这种交往“已经达到了相当程度”。
    为了替美国政府这种既不愿意在外交上承认民主德国、又被迫要同民主德国打交道的这种尴尬处境作辩解，杜勒斯说，美国将把民主德国当作苏联的“代理人”来跟它打交道，而不同意让“东德政权代替苏联来履行苏联的义务和责任”。
    杜勒斯竭力强调，他的关于西方国家在柏林问题上将采取什么作法的话是西方“一致同意的”，西方国家存在着“基本的协议”，“不会发生任何引起分歧的事件”。但是据报道，在杜勒斯举行记者招待会后，波恩方面对杜勒斯的谈话立即表示“感到意外”。西德政府发言人26日晚上强调说，关于对民主德国的态度，西方并不存在“协议”，波恩将反对杜勒斯的意见。
